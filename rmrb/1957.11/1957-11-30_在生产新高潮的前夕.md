On the Eve of a New Upsurge in Production
\tBy our reporter Fan Rongkang

Time flies. The "unusual spring" is still vivid in our minds, and in the blink of an eye, it is already the snowy winter. Since that unforgettable spring, people have experienced so many thrilling events! In factories and mines, following the anti-rightist struggle in society, there was a high tide of great release and great contention; then, there was another high tide of rectification and reform. Winter is not a season of harvest, but the great ideological revolution, the deep thinking and debate of people in these days, has begun to bear fruit. Sensitive people have discovered that a powerful force among the masses is surging like a torrent.

To report on this upsurge, the reporter visited the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory. This factory is currently in the stage of launching rectification, reform, and review. The Party committee office was full of smoke, with constant meetings, and the Party Secretary had no time to receive the sudden visit of the reporter. The secretary found the chairman of the trade union, but a difficult voice came from the telephone receiver: "Oh dear! I haven't touched the production situation for a while." The secretary of the Communist Youth League also shook his head: "We are busy sending cadres down, and we don't know much about production." Finally, I went to the door of the factory director's office.

Fortunately, the factory director, Li Benzheng, and some comrades from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions who came to the factory were talking about production issues. He said: Regarding production, in recent days, the leadership has relaxed, and even today, it has not freed up enough energy to seriously grasp production. But production is not bad; it is better. Why? Comrade Li Ben smiled meaningfully, holding a cup of hot tea: "We are all relying on rectification for our meals!"

A few months ago, when the rectification movement had just begun, despite the central government's instructions that rectification and production should not be delayed, and despite the fact that rectification would inevitably promote production was undeniable in theory, I believe that at that time, Comrade Li Ben could not have talked about rectification and production as calmly as he does today. In those days of "burning oneself," when tens of thousands of big-character posters revealed all kinds of problems, shortcomings, and errors in the work of the enterprise, when people buried themselves in studying these opinions and handling them under the supervision of thousands of bright eyes, although they also thought about "not delaying production" and believed that "rectification and reform will be good for production," they did not expect that the positive effects of the rectification movement would be reflected so quickly, so widely, and so deeply in production. So that although production was not directly grasped very well, the production of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory was not bad, but better. This is what Comrade Li Ben meant by "relying entirely on rectification for our meals."

The past few days have indeed been extraordinary days.

These days have been the days when people's thinking has been the most active and has improved the fastest. The anti-rightist struggle has presented people with a series of major topics, educating them to better distinguish between right and wrong. Some concepts that seemed to have been accepted in the past have been "ruminated" and are now more firmly believed in; some problems that were not clear in the past have been clarified through thinking. An old worker who seemed to have not been very active in politics in the past submitted an application to join the Party, and a young worker who also seemed to have not been very active in politics in the past submitted an application to join the Communist Youth League. Why? Because never before has there been such a profound movement as the anti-rightist struggle that has made them feel the need to firmly stand on the side of socialism; never before has there been such a fire as rectification that has made them feel the Party's fairness and greatness. Among the technical personnel, the issue of "redness" and "expertise" is thought-provoking. A young technician named Lin Aihui, a member of the Communist Youth League committee, told others that she had thought that if she did not do the work of the Communist Youth League, she might make faster progress in her professional work. She said that she now felt that this idea was wrong. The workers' thoughts are also not calm. "What kind of career is labor?" Wu Chengzhuan, a fourth-grade worker in the tool workshop, asked himself this question. He felt that when he was still an apprentice with little knowledge a few years ago, he was a hardworking and ambitious young man; but in recent years, why did he "work during working hours, and never think about production after work"? Why has the enthusiasm for labor and the research on labor declined so much? He felt that he needed to work better. In the past, people often came to the factory director's office to ask for houses and argue about wages, but since some time, such visitors have disappeared. When the Party secretary, factory director, and trade union chairman visited the staff dormitory, they were greeted not by tears that could not be restrained due to the accidental visit of leading cadres, but by pure comradely enthusiasm, sometimes mixed with family-like care: "Look at this windy day, don't run around outside!"

These days are the days of drastically improving work. "Large organizations and mutual buck-passing" are the masses' biggest opinions on organizational management. As a result, the Personnel Section, the Education Section, and the Labor and Wage Section were merged; the General Affairs Section, the Capital Construction Section, and the Health Center were merged; and the Metallurgical Section, the Technology Section, and the Tool Section were also merged. With the merger of organizations, work is not more difficult, but easier. The factory is repairing the sewers, and in order to save costs, it is required to be completed before freezing. The contractor proposed that if the factory could solve the accommodation problem for the construction workers, it could increase the number of workers and complete the work ahead of schedule. In the past, if this problem occurred, the Capital Construction Section would have to submit a report to the factory director, who would approve it to the General Affairs Section for resolution. Not to mention the time-consuming process, if there were any problems in the middle, several units would have to find time to hold a meeting to study them. Now that the organizations have been merged, it is not necessary to go through the factory director, and the section can solve the problem. In the past, the Metallurgical Section, the Technology Section, and the Tool Section divided a complete process into three parts, resulting in a lot of buck-passing; now they are merged into one, which accelerates the process of process design and tool manufacturing. In the workshop, the number of personnel has been reduced by more than half, and many people cannot find a well-deserved job title. The work of the planner and the dispatcher is now combined in one person. What should he be called now? If he is called a planner, he also manages dispatch; if he is called a dispatcher, he also does planning; if he is called a planning dispatcher, he also manages the ledger. The consensus is: no matter what he is called, he must do the work he can do. "Loose in the front and tight in the back" is the masses' biggest opinion on production management. The processing workshop has strengthened the planning work, mastered the manufacturing situation of more than 10,000 parts for the combine harvester, strengthened the production management of the night shift, solved the phenomenon of no one being responsible for night shift production and lax labor discipline, and reversed the situation that the production of parts could not meet the needs of the assembly workshop. The assembly workshop organized a流水作业线, and competitions were launched between the various processes, with big-character posters posted to urge each other. By the 22nd, more than a dozen combine harvesters had been assembled, which was a great improvement compared to the situation in October, when not a single unit had been assembled by the 22nd, and everything was squeezed into a last-minute rush at the end of the month.

These days are the days when cadres are sent down, and the backbone of production is constantly strengthened. Wang Wentao, the section chief of the forging workshop, and Liu Shishan, the tool operator, have returned to work as steel pressers. They said: "We are going back to production, but not just to production; we also want to do more ideological and organizational work like cadres." On their first day of going down to production, the steel pressing production record increased from six tons to more than eleven tons. People said: "Experienced hands are different after all." Yu Canfang, a master model designer in the Metallurgical Section, an eighth-grade model worker, has returned to the casting workshop to work as a model worker. For a long time, the model workers in the casting workshop have all been young people. An expert 6th grade master took over a team of a dozen of the younger ones, taking care of this and not that. Some troublesome work can only be outsourced. With Yu Canfang and other masters returning to the model group, people no longer worry about this weak link. Wu Zhongshan, the technical team leader of the casting workshop, a veteran worker with 30 years of experience, has returned to work as a fitter. On the first day of returning to the production post, he carefully looked around the workshop, looking at where to start work. Wu Zhongshan grew up watching the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory. He personally participated in the construction of the first annealing furnace in the casting workshop, and he watched the factory buildings rise from the ground. But in the days when he was the technical team leader, he spent his days going in and out of various conference rooms, running around for business contacts, but he did not realize that his beloved workshop was already a bit old. Look! The base of the big chimney has cracks and should be reinforced. He noted this matter and walked forward. Look! The reconstruction project of the No. 5 annealing furnace according to his suggestion is still shelved. In the past, this annealing furnace used I-beams and refractory bricks as the live cover, which would be damaged after burning a few furnaces. Moreover, since mechanical discharging cannot be used, workers have to wait for the furnace bottom temperature to drop from 900 degrees to 100 degrees before they can go down to the furnace to lift the boxes, which prolongs the operation time and consumes more coal. He had suggested making a fixed furnace cover and using mechanical discharging. But the cover was made, and it was not used because the problem of mechanical discharging was not solved. He noted this matter again and continued to move forward. In the past, there were no repair fitters in the workshop. To solve these problems, it was necessary to draw drawings, make plans, report to the factory, and ask other workshops for assistance. Now, Wu Zhongshan solved these problems one by one with waste materials in a few days. Now, Wu Zhongshan is designing an automatic feeding device on the cupola. The casting workshop has since had a shrewd and capable old housekeeper.

A little bit of ideological improvement, all kinds of work improvements, and the sending down of cadres are all shining like fireflies in production. This light may be weak when viewed separately, but when concentrated, it is a brilliant torch.

"If we organize a labor competition and launch a production upsurge, judging from the mood of the masses, the conditions are completely ripe," Comrade Li Ben said. "The problem now lies with the leadership. Our factory, like other agricultural machinery factories, is in such a situation: the rural areas after cooperativization urgently need agricultural machinery, but what is needed is agricultural machinery suitable for various different soil conditions and natural conditions in China. Our current products do not fully meet the requirements in this regard. The most serious task facing us is to trial-produce new products. The most difficult thing to complete this task at present is the weakness of product design, the weakness of process design, and the backwardness of office work. If we launch a socialist competition and launch a production upsurge, we should focus on solving this problem."

Comrade Li Ben's analysis is correct. On the eve of a new production upsurge, what should the leading cadres of the enterprise do? There is no doubt that we should grasp the key to production. Since design work and office work have become the biggest threat to future production, we should firmly grasp it and solve it in conjunction with rectification and reform; take this as the main content of welcoming and organizing the production upsurge. However, this is only one aspect of the problem. The production activities of an enterprise are always mass activities. Therefore, we must also consider another issue: what kind of response will the leadership give to the workers' soaring production enthusiasm? What direction should the workers' full production energy be guided to? What preparations should the workers make for the trial production of future new products? In the current production, where should their energy and wisdom be directed? These are the questions that the broad masses of workers and workshop cadres have already raised. Some people have also put forward proactive suggestions: judging from the current production situation, there is no big problem in completing the production task. Can we put forward the slogan of "three-good competition" of good quality, good saving, and good safety? Some people have begun to feel depressed because these problems have not been well resolved.

This is a problem that the Party Committee of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory of the Communist Party of China needs to seriously study. If it is said that in the past, although production was not directly grasped very well, it was still possible to "rely on rectification for food," and by taking advantage of the great influence of the rectification movement, production was not worsened, but improved; then, today, when the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees are unprecedentedly high, and a comprehensive production upsurge is surging forward, if we do not actively prepare and lead this upsurge, we will lag behind.

Of course, "actively preparing" is completely different from "rushing to battle."

    在生产新高潮的前夕	本报记者　范荣康
    时间过得真快。“不平常的春天”历历在目，转眼已是大雪纷纷的寒冬了。从那永远难忘的春天开始，人们经历了多少惊心动魄的事情！在厂矿企业里，紧接着社会上的反右派斗争，是一个大放大鸣的高潮；接着，又是一个边整边改的高潮。冬天，本来不是收获的季节，但思想上的大革命运动，人们在这些日子里的深思和争辩，却开始丰收了。敏感的人发现群众中有一股强大的力量正像激流一样奔腾着。
    为了报道这个高潮，记者访问了北京农业机械厂。这个厂目前还处在发动整改复查的阶段。党委办公室里烟雾腾腾，会议不断，党委书记无暇接待突然来访的记者。秘书同志给找工会主席，却听得电话筒里传来一阵为难的声音：“呵唷！这一晌没有摸生产的情况”。团委书记也摇摇头：“我们忙着搞干部下放呢，生产的事情了解不多”。最后，我找到厂长办公室的门上去。
    恰好，厂长李本正同市总工会下厂的一些同志在谈生产问题。他说：关于生产，这些日子从领导上来说，是放松了的，即便是在今天，也还没有腾出足够的力量认真抓生产。但生产却不是糟了；而是好了。为什么呢？李本同志端着一杯热茶，意味深长地笑道：“我们是全靠整风吃饭呵！”
    几个月以前，当整风运动刚开始的时候，尽管中央有整风生产两不误的指示，尽管整风必能推动生产在道理上是不容置疑的，但我相信，在当时，李本同志是不可能像今天这样从容地谈起整风和生产的问题的。在那些“引火烧身”的日子里，当数以万计的大字报揭开了企业工作各种各样的问题、缺点和错误，当人们埋首于研究这些意见，在几千双雪亮的眼睛督促下处理这些意见的时候，尽管他们也想过
  “不要耽误了生产”，也相信“边整边改对生产会有好处”，但整风运动的积极效果在生产上会反映得这么快，这么广，这么深，却是意料不到的。以致虽然没有很好地直接抓生产，北京农业机械厂的生产也不是糟了，而是好了。这就是李本同志所说的“全靠整风吃饭”。
    过去的这些日子，确实是些不平常的日子。
    这些日子，是人们的思想最活泼、也是提高得最快的日子。反右派斗争给人们出了一系列关系重大的题目，教育人们更明辨了是非。一些过去好像已经接受了的观念，经过“反嚼”，更坚信了；一些过去搞不清楚的问题，经过思想，搞明确了。一个过去似乎在政治上并不怎么开展的老工人递上了入党申请书，一个过去似乎也是在政治上并不怎么开展的青年工人递上了入团申请书。为什么呢？因为从来没有像反右派斗争这样深刻的运动，使他们感到需要坚决地站在社会主义的一边；从来没有像整风这样的烈火，使他们感到党的公正、伟大。技术人员中，“红”和“专”的问题发人深思。一位名叫林霭萱的青年技术员，团委委员，告诉别人，她曾经想过：如果不做团的工作，在业务上可能会进步得更快些。她说：她现在觉得这种想法错了。工人的思想也是不平静的。“劳动是怎样的事业？”工具车间四级工吴澄庄向自己提出了这样的问题。他觉得：当几年前他还是一个懂得很少的徒工时，自己曾经是一个发奋图强的青年人；但这些年来，为什么“上班时干活，下班后就再也不想生产上的事”了呢？为什么对劳动的热情、对劳动的钻研，竟是这样的衰落下来？他觉得他要更好地来劳动。厂长办公室里，以前是常有人来要房子，争工资的，但不知从什么时候起，这样的来访者不见了。当党委书记、厂长和工会主席到职工宿舍访问的时候，迎接他们的，不再是由于领导干部偶然拜访而情不自禁流下的眼泪，而是纯粹同志式的热情，有时还掺杂着亲人般的体贴：“瞧这大风天的，就别在外头跑了吧！”
    这些日子，是大刀阔斧改进工作的日子。“机构庞大、相互扯皮”，是群众对组织管理上最大的意见。于是，人事科、教育科、劳动工资科合并了；总务科、基建科、卫生所合并了；冶金科、工艺科、工具科也合并了。机构合并了，工作不是难做了，而是好做了。厂里正在修下水道，为了节省费用，要求在结冻前完工。承包单位提出如果厂方能解决建筑工人的住宿问题，可以增加工人，提前完工。这个问题，若在从前，要由基建科打报告给厂长，厂长批给总务科解决。费时不说，中间若有问题，还得几个单位找时间开会研究。现在，机构合并了，不必经过厂长，科里就把问题解决了。从前，冶金科、工艺科、工具科，把一个完整的工艺过程“三分天下”，扯皮不少；现在合而为一，加速了工艺设计和工具制造的过程。车间里，人员精减过半，许多人安不上名副其实的职务名称。计划员和调度员的工作并在一个人身上了，现在叫他什么员呢？说是计划员，他还管调度；说是调度员，他又做计划；说是计划调度员，他还兼管台账。一致的认识是：管他叫什么员，能做的工作就得做。“前松后紧”，是群众对生产管理最大的意见。加工车间加强了计划工作，掌握了制造康拜因的一万多件零件的制造情况，加强了夜班的生产管理，解决了夜班生产无人负责和劳动纪律松弛的现象，扭转了零件生产供不上装配车间需要的情况。装配车间组织了流水作业线，各个工序之间展开了竞赛，贴出大字报互相督促。到22日，已经装出十几台康拜因，比10月份到22日时，一台还没有装成，全部挤在月末突击的情况大有改进。
    这些日子，是干部下放，生产中的骨干力量不断充实的日子。锻工车间的工段长王文涛，工具员刘士山回来当压钢工了。他们说：“我们回去生产，但不只是生产；我们还要像干部一样多做思想工作和组织工作”。在他们下放生产的第一天，压钢的生产记录从六吨提高到十一吨多。人们说：“驾轻就熟，老手毕竟不同”。冶金科的模型设计员于灿芳老师傅，八级模型工，回到铸工车间当模型工了。长期以来，铸工车间的模型工尽是些娃娃，一个六级老师傅带着十几个徒工做活，顾了这头，顾不了那头。一些费事的活儿只能往外揽，于灿芳等几个老师傅回到模型组，人们不再为这个薄弱环节操心了。铸工车间的技术组长，三十年工龄的老工人吴锺山重新做了钳工。回到生产岗位第一天的大清早，他把车间的各处仔细瞧了个够，看看该从那儿着手工作。吴锺山是看着北京农业机械厂长大的。他亲自参加过铸工车间第一座焖火炉的建设，他看着厂房从平地上盖起来。但在他当技术组长的那些日子里，整天出入于各个会议室之间，为业务上的联系奔跑不息，却没有发现他亲爱的车间已经有点显老了。看！大烟囱的底座有了裂缝，应该加固。他记下这桩事，又向前走去。看！五号焖火炉按照他的建议所进行的改建工程还搁浅着呢。这个焖火炉过去是用工字钢和耐火砖作活盖的，烧不了几炉就会损坏。而且由于不能用机械出料，需要待炉底温度从九百度降到一百度时，工人才能下炉抬箱子，一来延长了作业时间，二来多耗了煤炭。他曾建议做个固定炉盖，并用机械出料。但盖子做出来了，由于机械出料的问题没有解决，也不曾用上。他又记下这桩事，继续向前走去。过去，车间里没有修理钳工，解决这些问题要绘图、做计划、报厂部、请外车间协作解决。如今，吴锺山自己动手，没有几天工夫，就用废料把这些问题一一解决了。现在，吴锺山又在设计冲天炉上的自动加料设备。铸工车间从此有了一个精明强干的老管家。
    一点一滴思想上的提高，各种各样工作上的改进，一个一个干部的下放，反映在生产上，都像萤火虫一样放着光亮。这光亮，分别地来看，也许是微弱的，但集中起来，却是辉煌的火炬。
    “如果组织一次劳动竞赛，掀起一个生产高潮，从群众情绪来看，条件是完全成熟了。”李本同志说：“现在的问题在于领导。我们的工厂同别的农业机械厂一样，正处在这样的情况中：合作化以后的农村迫切需要农业机械，但需要的是适合中国各种不同土壤情况、自然情况的农业机械。我们现在的产品，在这方面还不完全合乎要求。摆在我们面前最严重的任务，就是试制新产品。完成这个任务，目前最感到困难的是产品设计力量薄弱，工艺设计力量薄弱和科室工作落后，如果开展社会主义竞赛，掀起生产高潮的话，应该着重解决这个问题。”
    李本同志的分析是对的。在新的生产高潮的前夕，企业的领导干部应该做些什么呢？毫无疑问的是：应该抓生产关键。既然设计工作和科室工作成为今后生产中最大的威胁，就应该坚决抓住它，结合整改解决它；把这作为迎接和组织生产高潮的主要内容。可是，这只是问题的一个方面。企业的生产活动永远是群众性的活动，因此，必须同时考虑另一个问题：对于工人高涨的生产热情，领导上将作怎样的回答？应该把工人饱满的生产精力引导到什么方向去？工人们应该为未来的新产品试制作些什么准备？在目前的生产中，他们的精力、他们的智慧，应该使向何处？这是广大工人和车间干部已经提出来的问题。有的人还提出了积极性的建议：从目前生产情况来看，完成产量任务问题不大，是不是可以提出质量好、节约好、安全好的“三好竞赛”口号。有些人却由于这些问题没有很好的解决而开始感到苦闷。
    这，是需要中共北京农业机械厂党委会认真研究的问题。如果说，在过去，虽然没有很好地直接抓生产，还能“靠整风吃饭”，借着整风运动的伟大影响，使生产不是变糟了，而是变好了；那么，今天，当广大职工群众的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性空前高涨，一个全面的生产高潮正涌上前来的时候，再不积极作好准备，领导这个高潮，那就要落后了。
    当然“积极作好准备”同“仓促应战”是完全不同的。
