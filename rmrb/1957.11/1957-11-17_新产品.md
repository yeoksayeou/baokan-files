	Motorized Threshing Machine
	The Jiamusi Machinery Factory in Heilongjiang Province has recently successfully trial-produced a motorized threshing machine, manufactured according to blueprints of the latest Soviet model. This threshing machine is powered by a 25-horsepower motor and can thresh 3.4 tons of wheat per hour. During processing, the wheat breakage rate is only 0.019%.

	Corn Shelling Machine
	The Hailun County Iron Factory in Heilongjiang Province recently replicated a Soviet-style corn shelling machine. This machine can shell 1,500 jin of corn per hour, and during processing, there is no need to remove the corn husks. Just put the corn into the machine's container, and golden corn kernels will continuously flow out of the thresher's outlet. This thresher can be operated with a 4-horsepower prime mover, making it suitable for widespread use in rural areas.

	Potato Digging Machine
	The Kedong County Iron Factory in Heilongjiang Province recently successfully trial-produced a Soviet-style horse-drawn potato digger. It not only digs cleanly with a low damage rate, but also gathers the dug potatoes into piles.

    机动脱谷机
    黑龙江省佳木斯机械厂最近试制成功的一种机动脱谷机，是根据苏联最新型的产品的图纸制造的。这种脱谷机由二十五马力电动机牵引，每小时能脱出麦粒三·四吨。加工时，小麦破损率只有0．019％。
    剥玉米的机器
    黑龙江省海伦县铁工厂最近仿造了一种苏联式的玉米脱粒机。这种机械一小时能脱出玉米一千五百斤，而且加工时不用剥去玉米皮，只要把玉米投入机械的容器里，金黄色的玉米粒就不停地从脱粒机的出口处流出来。这种脱粒机可以用四马带动原动机来操作，广大农村都能推广使用。
    挖土豆的机器
    黑龙江省克东县铁工厂最近试制成功一种苏联式马拉起土豆机。它不但起得干净，破损率低，而且能把起出的土豆归聚成堆。
