Are American Youth "Free"?
		Cui Qi
	John Keats, a researcher of American school education, recently wrote an article in the "Saturday Evening Post." He said that the deeper he delved into the research, the more he felt that American school education was "a failure."

	John Keats believes that the current primary and secondary education in the United States is "anti-cultural and anti-intellectual." It "does not require children to think," but only emphasizes "suggestive vocational training and social adaptation courses," thus "hindering the intellectual development of children."

	"This trend of emphasizing technology and neglecting thought starts from elementary school." For example, in order to arouse students' "interest," elementary school arithmetic classes are renamed "What is the use of money?" In order to teach students the "social aspects" of mathematics, some elementary schools even established "school banks." There, forty-five minutes are spent every day electing young bank presidents, and the children take turns serving as tellers...

	In addition to this, what schools teach students is: "How to write letters, how to use the library, how to understand the latest information on various occupations, how to give speeches, how to talk, how to listen, how to distinguish between a poem and a novel, etc."

	Some high school courses also include: "How to answer the phone, sell houses, sell life insurance, dress appropriately, purchase cheap and good things, contact jobs in the federal government, drive a car, the etiquette of taking a girlfriend out, curling hair, typing, decorating the living room, budgeting pocket money, etc."

	What do students become under this kind of "education"? John Keats said: "Our children have no way of knowing that the basic element of any novel, speech, or poem lies in its content." "They only know that short stories are always short, and the ending is concise and powerful. Letters always start with Dear Sir and end with Yours faithfully, so-and-so, and the date is always written in the corner of the letter. Speeches should not be nervous, and the words should be spoken slowly and clearly..." In short, in order to "conform to society so that children can be well-behaved," schools "merely provide them with some formulas," "children do not need to think, as long as they have a good memory."

	John Keats only talked about primary and secondary schools. What about universities? Terry Ferrer, education editor of the American magazine "Newsweek," provided a similar picture in an article.

	He wrote: "Today's college students are not diligent students... Freshmen can't even do simple compositions and arithmetic, and some even have poor reading ability." A sophomore student gleefully admitted that he never reads newspapers unless he has to. At a discussion, a female college student suddenly stood up and excused herself, saying: "I must leave, because thinking gives me a headache." Terry Ferrer believes that such students are not isolated cases, but quite typical.

	So, why do they go to college? The answer: for a diploma. Terry Ferrer said that American society seems to be "self-contradictory." Although it is "fundamentally opposed to knowledge," a "university diploma has become the supreme magic weapon." Some enthusiastic statisticians even calculated the monetary value of a university diploma: a Bachelor of Arts degree can earn a person an extra $100,000 in their lifetime.

	Thus, in such a school and social environment, "most students are self-centered and not ashamed of it. What they pursue is the material satisfaction of themselves and their families. They always take care of themselves first." These college students have "completely accepted the customs of contemporary commercial society, and they are only realizing their personal desires within the scope of these customs. They are happy to conform to today's economic situation and expect to be richly rewarded for their loyal and fruitful efforts."

	This is a simple microcosm of American school education today.

	Some people say that American youth are "free." However, the above two articles remind me of the story of "wolf children." It is said that if a baby drinks wolf milk every day, it will have wolf nature. What is "freedom" for a "wolf child"? Similarly, when a child and youth's intelligence is developing, if he drinks the milk of poisonous thoughts every day, what is his "freedom"? Capitalist society, along with its educational institutions, is like a large dyeing vat soaked in the stench of money. Countless pure and young minds have been dyed the color that the bourgeoisie likes in an unconscious state. Countless young people are actually not free when they are not aware. And when they begin to awaken, all kinds of social forces come from all directions to restrict their freedom.

	Thus, some people only see one "path": "Completely accept the customs of contemporary commercial society," "only realize their personal desires within the scope of these customs." However, what kind of "scope of customs" is this? That is: not allowing any harm to the capitalist exploitation system and the millionaires, obediently acting as a tool in the bourgeoisie's huge exploitation machine, curling up in the gray shell of individualism and muddling through life. -- This is truly a pathetic "freedom," a cursed "freedom."

### 美国青年是“自由”的吗？

    美国青年是“自由”的吗？
    崔奇
    美国学校教育的研究者约翰·济茨最近在“星期六晚邮报”上写了一篇文章。他说，越是深入研究，就越感到美国的学校教育“是个失败”。
    约翰·济茨认为，目前美国的中小学教育是“反文化、反智力”的。它“不要求孩子思考”，而只强调“提示性的职业训练和社会适应的课程”，因此“阻碍了孩子们的心智的发展”。
    “这种一味强调技术而忽视思想的风气从小学就已开始。”例如，为了引起学生的“兴趣”，小学的算术课改名为“钱有什么用途”。为了把数学的“社会方面”教给学生，有的小学甚至成立了“学校银行”。在那里，每天都得花上四十五分钟的时间来选举青年的银行行长，并由孩子们轮流担任出纳……。
    除此以外，学校教给学生的就是：“如何写信，如何使用图书馆，如何了解各种职业的最近情况，如何演讲，如何谈话，如何听讲，如何辨明一首诗和一篇小说等等。”
    有一些高中的课程中还包括：“如何回答电话、卖房子、卖人寿保险、穿着适当、购置价廉物美的东西、接洽联邦政府中的工作、开汽车、携女友出游的礼仪、卷发、打字、装饰客厅、零用钱做预算等等”。
    在这种“教育”之下，学生变成什么样子呢？约翰·济茨说：“我们的儿童无从知道任何一篇小说、演说或诗篇的基本要素在于它的内容。”“他们只知道短篇小说总是短的，结尾简短而有力。信件就是以亲爱的先生开始并以你忠实的某某结束，日期总是写在信角上。演讲就不要紧张，话要说得缓慢清晰……。”总之，为了“顺应社会以使儿童循规蹈矩”，学校“仅仅是供给他们一些公式”，“儿童用不着思考，只要有好的记忆力就成了”。
    约翰·济茨还只谈到中小学。那么，大学如何呢？美国“新闻周刊”教育栏编辑特里·费莱尔在一篇文章里提供了类似的景况。
    他写道：“现在的大学生都不是什么勤学苦读的学生。……一年级学生连简单的作文和算术都不会，有些人甚至阅读能力也很差。”有一个二年级大学生津津乐道地承认：除非万不得已，他从不看报。在某一个讨论会上，一个女大学生忽然起立告辞说：“我必须退席了，因为思考使我头痛。”特里·费莱尔认为，这样的学生并不是个别的，而是相当典型的。
    那么，他们为什么要上大学呢？答案：为了文凭。特里·费莱尔说，美国社会似乎是“自相矛盾”的，它虽然“基本上反对知识”，可是“大学文凭却成为至高无上的法宝”。有些热心的统计家甚至计算出大学文凭的金钱价值：一张文学士的文凭可以使一个人一辈子多收入十万美元。
    于是，在这样的学校和社会环境里，“大多数学生都是自我中心而不以为耻。他追求的是个人以及家庭的物质上的满足。他什么事都是首先照顾自己。”这些大学生已经“完全接受当代商业社会的习俗，他们只是在这个习俗的范围内实现他们的个人愿望。他们欣然乐意地顺应今日的经济现状，并期望由于他们的忠顺的有成果的努力而获得丰富的报酬。”
    这就是今天美国学校教育的一个简单的缩影。
    有人说美国的青年是“自由”的。但是，上述的两篇文章却使我想起了“狼孩子”的故事。据说，一个婴儿如果天天喝狼奶，它就会有狼性。对于“狼孩子”来说，它的“自由”是什么呢？同样的，当一个儿童和青年的智力正在发育的时候，如果他天天喝着充满毒素的思想的奶汁，他的“自由”又是什么呢？资本主义社会连同它的教育机关，好像是一个浸透了铜臭的大染缸，无数纯洁的幼小的心灵，在不知不觉的状态中已被染成资产阶级所喜欢的颜色。无数的青年，当他们没有觉悟的时候，他们实际上是不自由的。而当他们开始觉悟以后，各种各样的社会力量又从四面八方来限制他们的自由。
    于是，有些人就只看到了一条“路”：“完全接受当代商业社会的习俗”，“只是在这个习俗的范围内实现他们的个人愿望”。然而，这是怎样一个“习俗的范围”呢？那就是：不许触动资本主义剥削制度和百万富翁的一根毫毛，驯驯服服地在资产阶级的巨大剥削机器里充当一个工具，蜷曲在个人主义的灰色贝壳里胡里胡涂地混一生。——这真是可悲的“自由”，可诅咒的“自由”啊。
