    Shang and Zhou Bronze Artifacts Discovered in Shanxi

    A batch of bronze artifacts was discovered near Erlangpo in Shilou County, Shanxi Province last autumn. This batch of bronze artifacts totals fifteen pieces, divided into four categories: food vessels, wine vessels, weapons, and tools. Judging from the shape and style of the artifacts, they are likely relics from the Yin Shang or early Western Zhou period. Among this batch of bronze artifacts, the *taotie*-patterned sharp-footed *jia* and the double owl *you* are the most precious. Both cultural relics are extremely vivid, solemn, and magnificent in shape, and are great artistic works of the ancient Chinese working people. The picture shows the double owl *you*.

    山西发现商周铜器
    山西省石楼县二郎坡附近在去年秋季发现了一批铜器，这批铜器共十五件，分食器、酒器、兵器、工具等四类。从器物的形制上看，可能是殷商或西周早期的遗物。这批铜器中以饕餮纹锐足斝和双鴞卣最为珍贵。两件文物，造形十分生动、庄严、瑰丽，是我国古代劳动人民的伟大艺术作品。图是双鴞卣。
