    Good Work During the Day, Good Study at Night
    Number of Night School Students at Tianjin University More Than Doubles
    (Our dispatch) Tianjin University's night school has only been established for a little over a year, and it has already achieved considerable success in its teaching work. There has been a significant improvement and development in both the quality and quantity of students. Last year, the night school only offered three majors: Mechanical Manufacturing Technology, Industrial Enterprise Electrification, and Architecture, with 179 formal students and 41 probationary students. This semester, in addition to the original three majors, a Chemical Engineering major has been added, and there are now a total of 451 new and returning students. The teaching plan, which originally stipulated 12 class hours per week, has classes during the evenings from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM, except for Wednesday afternoons. Despite this, the students' enthusiasm and initiative for learning are very high. Most students regard learning as a political task assigned to them by the organization, and some feel that they must improve themselves due to the needs of their work. Therefore, they are generally able to overcome difficulties and persist in their studies. Some students live far from the school and do not get home until around 11:00 PM after class ends at 9:30 PM. Despite such hardships, everyone manages to attend classes on time. Hao Xiongbin, a second-year student in Enterprise Electrification, exemplifies this spirit even more remarkably. He has never been absent from class since enrolling and seizes every opportunity to study, even setting aside time on Sundays for self-study. Liu Zhengyi, a former probationary student in the second year of the Architecture program, although she is the mother of two children and needs to take care of household chores, can still persist in working during the day and studying at night, and her academic performance is excellent. In the past two semesters, except for one subject in which she received a passing grade, she has received excellent grades in all other subjects, and she has now been transferred to a formal student. In the past year, the night school has produced 27 students who are excellent or outstanding in their studies, accounting for 12.3% of the original number of students. Night school students also share a common characteristic: they have generally worked for more than two years and have some practical work experience. Therefore, they have a strong ability to understand issues and can more easily understand theoretical problems based on their practical work experience. In addition, most night school students are learning what they use and using what they learn. Therefore, night school students feel that their studies meet the needs of their work, and their interest in learning is very high. After a short period of study, they feel that the knowledge they have acquired is helpful to their current work.
    This semester, in response to the characteristics of teaching, the teaching plan for the night university has been revised, the teaching content has been streamlined, and the original 12 class hours per week have been reduced to 9 hours. Due to the conscientious improvement of teaching, the contradiction between study and production/work in terms of time has been basically resolved; the situation of students' excessive burden of work and study has also been improved. This will inevitably help improve the quality of teaching. The original training goal of the night school – to basically reach the level of a four-year undergraduate program – is even more guaranteed. (De Chang)

### 白天工作好　晚上学习好  天津大学夜大学学生增加一倍多

    白天工作好　晚上学习好
    天津大学夜大学学生增加一倍多
    本报讯　天津大学夜大学创办到现在才一年多，在教学工作中已取得了不少成绩，不论在学生质量与数量上都有很大的提高和发展。去年，夜校只设有机械制造工艺学，工业企业电气化，建筑学等三个专业，有一百七十九名正式生，四十一名试读生；本学期除了原有三个专业外，又增设了化学工程专业，现共有新老学生四百五十一人；原执行的周学时为十二小时的教学计划，除了占每周星期三下午外，其余都在晚上七点至九点半的业余时间上课。尽管如此，学生学习的积极性与自觉性都很高。大多数同学把学习看做是组织上交给他们的政治任务，有的同学从工作上的需要，感到自己必须提高，因此他们一般地都能克服困难坚持学习。其中有的居住地在离校很远，晚上九点半下课后，到十一点钟左右才能到家。虽然如此艰苦，大家都能按时来学习。企电二年级学生郝雄斌这种精神表现得更为显著，他从入学以来从未旷课，抓紧时间学习，在星期天仍抽时间进行自学。还有建筑学专业二年级原试读生刘正怡，虽然已经是两个孩子的母亲，家事又需要她照料，但也能坚持白天工作，晚上学习，而且学习成绩很好。她两个学期以来，除一门课为及格成绩以外，其他均为优良，她现在已转为正式生。一年以来，夜校已出现了二十七名在学习上的优良与优秀的学生，占原有学生数的12．3％。夜校学生还有一共同特点：同学们一般地都工作了二年以上，有一定的实际工作经验，因此，理解问题的能力较强，比较容易从实际工作经验上去体会与理解理论上的问题；另外夜校学生大多数是学用一致的，做什么，学什么，因此夜校同学都感到学习切合工作上的需要，学习兴趣很高。他们经过短期学习以后，就感到所学到的知识，对自己目前所从事的工作是有帮助的。
    这学期，针对教学的特点，重新修订了夜大学的教学计划，精减了教学内容，将原执行的周学时十二小时减为九小时。由于认真地改进了教学，从而基本上解决了学习与生产、工作在时间上的矛盾；学生工作和学习的负担过重的情况也有所改善。这样就必然有助于教学质量的提高。夜校原定的培养目标——基本上达到本科四年制的水平，更加有了保证。　　　　　　　　　　　　（德常）
