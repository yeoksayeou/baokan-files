    With the deepening development of the rectification campaign, many localities and units have taken streamlining institutions and reducing personnel as one of the important contents of rectification and improvement, which is correct. Beijing plans to transfer 30% to 50% of its staff from municipal and district-level organs and management departments of enterprises and institutions to participate in production and work at the grassroots level for a relatively long period. As of the end of October, more than 21,000 people had been transferred. Units such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Qinghe Woolen Mill have reduced more than half of their administrative staff. Many other regions, departments, and enterprises are also vigorously streamlining their organizations, transferring a number of people to work at the grassroots level and engage in productive labor. Consequently, the phenomenon of bloated organizations and excessive personnel has been somewhat overcome. According to incomplete statistics, more than 300,000 cadres have returned to production posts or been transferred from state organs at all levels. However, there are still many localities and units that lack this revolutionary spirit of decisiveness and have not resolved to cut and merge overlapping institutions or reduce redundant staff. As a result, the work of streamlining institutions and reducing personnel has been slow to start. Some units have formulated plans but have not implemented them conscientiously. Some units have not even formulated plans, simply waiting for higher authorities to issue targets. At a time when the rectification campaign is gradually shifting to a stage focused on rectification and improvement, it is necessary to raise this issue to draw the attention of leading organs at all levels.
    This work of streamlining institutions and reducing personnel is being carried out in accordance with the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session and the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a call to the entire Party and the people of the whole country to increase production and practice economy. One of the important contents of this call is that we must conscientiously streamline institutions and consolidate staffing to improve the efficiency of government work and save administrative, institutional, and enterprise management expenses. During the rectification campaign, especially in the course of the great contending and great blooming, cadres and workers in many units sharply criticized the irrational phenomena in the establishment of institutions and personnel staffing, and put forward many positive suggestions. The criticisms of the masses are correct. In the central and local areas, some institutions have been set up that should not have been set up, resulting in overlapping institutions and duplication of work. Some matters that could be handled by a small institution require a large institution to handle them. Some institutions have blindly set up a large stall without clarifying issues such as their system, tasks, and scope of responsibilities, resulting in many people having nothing to do, or only being able to work for half a day or a few hours. Walking into many organs and enterprises, one can see many people shouting "There are too many people in the organs" on the dazzling array of big-character posters. One department originally had a maximum of only half a day's work per person per day, but in the midst of the call to streamline institutions, the leadership assigned three more people to them, with the result that the team leader was unable to assign work and had to let the three people do work that others had already done. Clearly, this phenomenon is extremely unreasonable and should not be allowed to continue.
    Our administrative organs are for serving the people, and our management departments of institutions and enterprises directly serve production and construction and the people's lives. They should all have high work efficiency, should do more with less manpower, and should earnestly do things well. However, large institutions and excessive personnel not only fail to achieve this goal, but also bring serious harm to our cause. First of all, if the institution is too large and there are too many people, it will inevitably increase the expenditure of state administrative expenses and enterprise management expenses. In the previous period, the Shijingshan Power Plant calculated an account: the plant could save about 60,000 yuan per year from fuel and plant electricity, while reducing management personnel could save 140,000 yuan per year in wages alone, and even tens of thousands of yuan in savings on various welfare expenses. That is to say, if the Shijingshan Power Plant does not streamline its institutions and reduce personnel, its annual savings will not be enough to offset the wages of redundant personnel. If every factory and mine enterprise is like this, how can we increase accumulation and continuously expand the cause of socialist construction? We should use limited funds for production and construction, and should not and will not allow the increase of state expenditure on the establishment of institutions and personnel staffing. This is self-evident.
    It should be seen that the more serious malady of bloated institutions and excessive personnel is that it encourages bureaucracy, red tape, and preoccupation with routine matters in government work. In the central and local areas, there are often such phenomena: due to overlapping institutions and too many levels, a matter or a document has to be discussed by this agency, studied by that department, and go through ten or even more approval procedures, often taking half a month, a month, or even longer. How can such work efficiency meet the needs of the ever-changing socialist construction? Moreover, because leading staff are mired in the mire of red tape and preoccupation with routine matters, and are busy holding meetings and reviewing documents all day long, this will cause the leading organs to become divorced from reality and divorced from the masses, and they are prone to commit subjective and bureaucratic errors in their work. At the same time, to stockpile a large number of capable and experienced cadres and ordinary young people in leading organs and management departments is tantamount to wasting the most valuable wealth—labor power, making it impossible for many outstanding cadres to display their talents, and making it impossible for those cadres who have not undergone practical work training to get opportunities for training. The vast grassroots organizations, however, cannot better carry out production and construction because they do not have strong leading backbones and do not get more educated and technically skilled people. In short, from whatever point of view, streamlining institutions and reducing personnel is very necessary, and it is an indispensable and important measure to conscientiously rectify our work style, improve the work of the Party and the state, and implement the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift.
    To emphasize the special circumstances of one's own department and not conscientiously carry out the work of streamlining institutions and reducing personnel is a manifestation of a lack of determination to rectify work style and improve work, and a lack of attention to the criticisms and suggestions of the masses. After the rectification campaign has entered the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement, Party and government leading organs at all levels should seize this work and take it as one of the main contents of rectification and improvement. For those units where the irrational phenomena in the establishment of institutions and personnel staffing have not been fully exposed, it is necessary to fully expose them by launching the great contending and great blooming and mobilizing the masses. Because only in this way can the leaders of these units be awakened in the face of the facts and be determined to streamline institutions and reduce personnel. In order to enable this work to be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, all units should establish special groups or committees, widely absorb the participation of the masses, and collect, sort out, and study the criticisms and suggestions of the masses under the personal leadership of the responsible personnel. In addition to solving problems that can be solved quickly in a timely manner, this special organization should make a comprehensive consideration of the establishment of institutions and personnel staffing in this unit. First of all, it should consider how to cut and merge overlapping institutions and institutions with few people and few things to do; then, according to the current actual needs, put forward a preliminary reorganization plan, submit it to the masses for discussion and leadership approval, and then resolutely implement it. It is necessary to rely on the support and supervision of the masses in this rectification campaign to thoroughly rectify all state organs and management departments of enterprises and institutions, so as to make their organizational structure and personnel staffing more rational, more streamlined, and highly efficient, and able to better shoulder the increasingly arduous construction tasks.
    It should be explained that in our big country, various construction undertakings are developing vigorously, and there are many places where people are really needed. Especially on the agricultural front, manpower is needed. Therefore, transferring redundant personnel to grassroots organizations and mobilizing them to participate in production, especially to participate in production in rural areas, should become the main direction of the reorganization. This can not only achieve the purpose of streamlining institutions, reducing personnel, and improving the efficiency of government work; but also enrich and strengthen grassroots organizations, and add a new force with culture and technology to the labor production front, which can train and transform cadres in labor production and play a role in changing customs and habits. This is a revolutionary measure with great political and economic significance in the rectification campaign. This time, Anhui Province has done a relatively good job in the reorganization work. As of mid-June, the province had transferred more than 57,000 cadres, arranged for more than 46,700 people, of which more than 90% of the personnel were placed in labor production positions, and mainly engaged in agricultural and sideline production. This shows that taking the direction of facing the countryside and facing production as the main direction is completely correct. Of course, at the same time, we must also properly settle other personnel who are not suitable for participating in heavy physical labor, such as the elderly and infirm who are suitable for retirement, should be allowed to retire; female cadres with many children who are not suitable for working in organs and are willing to go home to take care of housework should be allowed to retire; those who must take long-term rest due to illness should be allowed to leave their jobs for rest, and so on. It is very necessary to properly settle them from all aspects.
    This work of streamlining institutions and reducing personnel is being carried out in the mass rectification campaign. In the struggle against the rightists and the rectification, the vast number of staff members have raised their political and ideological awareness and realized the importance of participating in labor production for building the country and transforming themselves. This is an extremely favorable condition for this reorganization work. We believe that as long as the leading organs are determined and implement the working method of the mass line, conscientiously do a good job in political and ideological education, and solve the necessary and possible difficulties for those who are transferred and participate in production, this reorganization work will be successfully completed and will have a positive and good effect on the country's construction.

    应当坚决紧缩机构，减少人员，改进工作
    随着整风运动的深入发展，许多地方和许多单位，都把紧缩机构和减少人员作为整改的重要内容之一，这是对
  的。北京市计划从市、区两级机关和事业、企业管理部门中，分别抽调30％到50％的工作人员，较长时期地到基层去参加生产和工作。到10月底为止，已经下放了二万一千多人。石景山钢铁厂和清河制呢厂等单位，已经减少了一半以上的行政管理人员。还有许多地区、部门和企业单位也正在大力进行紧缩机构的工作，陆续抽调了一批人，到基层参加工作和从事生产劳动，因而机构臃肿庞大和人员过多的现象已有所克服。据不完全的统计，仅在各级国家机关中回到生产岗位和下放的干部，已达三十多万人。但是，也还有不少地方和不少单位，仍然十分缺乏这种革命的果断精神，没有下决心裁减和合并重叠的机构，减少多余的工作人员，因而紧缩机构和减少人员的工作迟迟不能开展；有的单位虽然制订了方案，但是没有认真地执行；有的单位甚至连方案也没有制订，一味等待上级给它们发指标。在目前整风运动已逐步转入着重整改阶段的时候，有必要把这个问题提出来，以引起各级领导机关的注意。
    这次的紧缩机构和减少人员的工作，是根据党的八届二中全会和三中全会的决议进行的。党的八届二中全会就向全党和全国人民发出了增产节约的号召。其中重要的内容之一，就是必须认真地紧缩机构和整顿编制，以提高机关工作效率，节约行政费和事业、企业管理费。在整风运动中，特别在大鸣大放中，许多单位的干部和职工，尖锐地批评了机构设置和人员编制上的不合理现象，并且提出了许多积极的建议。群众的批评是正确的。在中央和地方都有一些不该设置的机构设置了，因而造成机构重叠和工作重复的现象。有的只要一个小机构就办得了的事，却要设立一个大机构来办。有些机构在体制、任务、职责范围等项问题上都还没有弄清楚，就盲目地摆一个大摊子，因而许多人无事可作，或者只能工作半天或几小时。走进许多机关和企业里，人们可以看见，在琳琅满目的大字报上，很多人在喊叫“机关的人太多了”。有一个部门，本来每人每天的工作时间最多只有半天，但是在紧缩机构声中，领导上却又给他们分配去三个人，结果弄得组长无法分配工作，只好让这三个人作别人已经作过的工作。很显然，这种现象是极不合理的，绝不应该再继续下去。
    我们的行政机关是为人民办事的，我们的事业和企业管理部门，是直接为生产建设和人民的生活服务的。它们都应该具有高度的工作效率，应该用较少的人力办更多的事，而且要切实地把事情办好。但是，庞大的机构和过多的人员，却不仅不能达到这样的目的，而且会给我们的事业带来严重的危害。首先，机构过大了，人员过多了，就必然增加国家行政费和事业企业管理费的开支。前一个时期，石景山发电厂算了一笔账：这个厂节约燃料和厂用电两项，每年大约可得六万元，而减少管理人员以后，仅工资每年就可以节约十四万元，再加上各种福利费用的节约，更高达几十万元之巨。这就是说，如果石景山发电厂不实行紧缩机构和减少人员，它们每年节约所得，还抵不上多余人员的工资。如果每个厂矿企业都这样，我们怎么能够增加积累，不断地扩大社会主义建设事业呢？我们应该把有限的资金用到生产建设上，不应该也不容许在机构的设置和人员编制上增加国家的开支。这个道理是显而易见的。
    应该看到，机构臃肿和人员过多的更严重的弊害是，它助长了机关工作中的官僚主义、文牍主义和事务主义。在中央和地方，都经常有这样的现象：由于机构重叠，层次过多，一件事情或一个公文，要经过这个机关讨论，那个部门研究，要履行十道以至更多道的审批手续，费时往往是半月、一月，甚至需要更长的时间。试问，这样的工作效率，怎么能够适应日新月异的社会主义建设的需要？而且由于领导工作人员陷入文牍主义和事务主义的泥坑中，整天忙于召开会议和批阅公文，这就会使领导机关脱离实际和脱离群众，极易在工作中犯主观主义和官僚主义的错误。同时，把大批有能力有经验的干部和一般青年积压在领导机关和管理部门中，这就等于浪费最宝贵的财富——劳动力，使许多优秀的干部无法施展他们的才能，使那些本来没有经过实际工作锻炼的干部一直呆在机关里得不到锻炼的机会。而广大的基层组织，却又因为得不到坚强的领导骨干，得不到更多的有文化有技术的人，不能更好地开展生产建设。总之，不论从那一方面来看，紧缩机构和减少人员都是十分必要的，是认真地整顿我们的作风，改进党和国家的工作，贯彻执行勤俭建国方针的一个不可缺少的重要措施。
    强调本部门的情况特殊，不认真地进行紧缩机构和减少人员的工作，这是没有决心整顿作风和改进工作，不重视群众的批评建议的一种表现。在整风运动进入着重整改的阶段以后，各级党政领导机关都应当抓紧这个工作，把它作为整改的主要内容之一。对于那些机构设置和人员编制上的不合理现象还暴露得不充分的单位，要通过大鸣大放，发动群众充分加以揭露。因为只有这样，才能使这些单位的领导人，在事实的面前清醒过来，下决心紧缩机构和减少人员。为了使这个工作能够有计划、有步骤地进行，各单位都应该成立专门小组或者委员会，广泛地吸收群众参加，在负责人员的亲自领导之下，收集、整理和研究群众的批评建议。这个专门的组织，除了应该及时地解决能够迅速解决的问题以外，要对本单位的机构设置和人员编制作全面的考虑。首先应当考虑怎样裁并重叠的机构和人多事少的机构；然后再根据当前的实际需要，提出一个初步的整编方案，交由群众讨论和领导批准以后，坚决地实行。要作到在这次整风运动中，依靠群众的支持和监督，把所有的国家机关和事业企业管理部门切实整顿一次，使它们的组织机构和人员编制更合理、更精干，具有高度的工作效率，能够更好地担负起日益繁重的建设任务。
    应当说明，在我们这样一个大国里，各种建设事业正在蓬勃发展，真正需要人的地方是很多的。特别是农业战线上需要人力。因此，把多余人员下放到基层组织，动员他们去参加生产，特别是到农村去参加生产，这应该成为整编中的主要方向。这样做不但可以达到紧缩机构，减少人员，提高机关工作效率的目的；而且充实和加强了基层组织，为劳动生产战线增加了一批有文化有技术的生力军，可以在劳动生产中锻炼和改造干部，可以起到移风易俗的作用。这是整风运动中具有重大的政治意义和经济意义的革命措施。这次安徽省的整编工作就作得比较好。截至6月中旬，这个省已经抽调出五万七千多名干部，安置好了四万六千七百多人，其中90％以上的人员，都被安置在劳动生产岗位上，而且主要从事农副业劳动。这就说明，采取以面向农村和面向生产为主的方针，是完全正确的。当然，我们在同时也要妥善地安置其他不适宜于参加繁重的体力劳动的人员，如年老体弱、适合退职退休的，应当允许退职退休；孩子多、不适宜在机关工作而又愿意回家料理家务的女干部应当允许她们退职回家；因病必须长期休养的，应当让他们离职休养等等，这样从各方面想法子妥善地安置他们是很必要的。
    这次紧缩机构和减少人员的工作，是在全民整风运动中进行的。在反右派斗争和整风中，广大工作人员提高了政治思想觉悟，认识到参加劳动生产对于建设国家和改造自己的重要性。这是这次整编工作的极为有利的条件。我们相信，只要领导机关有决心，并且贯彻群众路线的工作方法，认真地作好政治思想教育工作，为下放和参加生产的人员解决必须而又可能解决的困难，这次整编工作就一定能够顺利完成，对国家的建设必将发生积极的良好的作用。
