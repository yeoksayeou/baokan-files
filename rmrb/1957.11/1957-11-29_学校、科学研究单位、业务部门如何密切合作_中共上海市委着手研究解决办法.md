Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 27th: The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CCP has begun to study and is working to resolve the issue of mutual cooperation between universities, secondary technical schools, and scientific research departments with relevant enterprises and agencies in Shanghai.

At a meeting convened yesterday by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CCP, it was announced that fourteen coordination groups had been established, covering chemical engineering, textiles, literature, journalism, economics, law, mechanical and electrical engineering, shipbuilding, civil engineering and architecture, medicine, education, history and library materials, pharmacy, and foreign languages. Participants in the groups include leaders and experts from schools, scientific research units, business departments, Party committees, and government departments. Each group will formulate preliminary cooperation plans in the near future.

Several professors and heads of business departments pointed out at the meeting that China's social system provides the conditions for all parties to cooperate fully, but in the past, cooperation between schools and business departments has not been good enough, and they often worked independently, sometimes inevitably causing waste. It has also been somewhat difficult to implement the integration of theory and practice in teaching. These have become problems that urgently need to be improved during the rectification campaign. For example, Shanghai's financial agencies have many experienced cadres, but Shanghai University of Finance and Economics lacks teachers, and this has not been resolved for a long time. The cadres of financial agencies need to improve themselves, and currently, more than 1,700 people are attending night school at the University of Finance and Economics, but the University of Finance and Economics, due to the lack of teachers, cannot better meet their hopes. Shanghai Higher Normal School, secondary normal schools, and primary and secondary schools are not connected closely enough, so the teaching experience of many schools cannot be fully applied to teacher training. Many enterprises and departments have problems in production that need the help of scientific research institutions to solve. Universities hope that business departments will utilize their experimental equipment, but this has not been adequately resolved in the past.

After these coordination groups are established, they will specifically study the difficulties existing in each unit and the methods of cooperation.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CCP has now begun to resolve some urgent problems. Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine lacks teachers, and no one teaches basic courses. During the rectification campaign, students posted many big-character posters criticizing the school. It has now been decided that Shanghai First and Second Medical Colleges and the Second Military Medical University of the People's Liberation Army will jointly find ways to support the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the leadership and teaching staff of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine can be strengthened in the short term.

At the meeting, the responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee hoped that all departments would overcome departmentalism, proceed from the overall situation, consider long-term interests, and promote close cooperation between schools, scientific research institutions, and business departments.

    学校、科学研究单位、业务部门如何密切合作
    中共上海市委着手研究解决办法
    新华社上海27日电　中共上海市委员会开始研究并着手解决上海高等学校、中等技术学校和科学研究部门有关企业、机关相互合作的问题。
    在昨天中共上海市委员会召开的会议上，宣布成立了化学化工、纺织、文学、新闻、经济、法学、机械电机、造船、土木建筑、医学、教育、历史图书资料、药学、外语等十四个协调小组。参加小组的有学校、科学研究单位、企业部门、党委、政府部门的负责人和专家等。各小组将在最近期间制定出初步的合作方案。
    好几位教授和业务部门的负责人，在会议上指出：我国的社会制度具备着各方面通力合作的条件，但是过去学校和业务部门合作得还不够好，常常是各搞一套，有时候难免造成浪费；在教学上贯彻理论与实际结合也有些困难，这些已成为整风中迫切需要改进的问题。如上海财经机关有不少有经验的干部，但是上海财经学院师资缺乏，却长期不能解决。财经机关的干部需要提高，目前有一千七百多人在财经学院上夜校，但是财经学院则由于师资的缺乏，不能更好地满足他们的希望。上海高等师范学校、中等师范学校和中、小学联系得不够，因此许多学校的教学经验，还不能充分运用到师范教学中去。许多企业部门生产中存在的问题，需要科学研究机关帮助他们解决。高等学校的实验设备希望业务部门加以利用，过去也都解决得不够。
    这些协调小组成立后，将具体研究各单位存在的困难和协作的办法。
    中共上海市委现在已经着手解决了一些迫切需要解决的问题。上海中医学院，师资力量不足，基础课没有人教，整风中学生贴了很多大字报，对校方提出批评。现在已决定由上海第一、二医学院、解放军第二军医大学共同设法支援中医学院，短期内即可加强中医学院的领导和师资力量。
    会议上，市委的负责同志希望各部门克服本位主义，从全局出发，从长远利益考虑，使学校、科学研究机关和业务部门密切合作。
