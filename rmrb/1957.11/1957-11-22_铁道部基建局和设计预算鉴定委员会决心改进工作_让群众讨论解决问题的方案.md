(Our report) The rectification work of the Ministry of Railways' Basic Construction Bureau and the Design Budget Appraisal Committee has shown initial results.

The rectification movement of these two units is being carried out jointly. From October 14th to 26th, seventy staff members of the bureau (committee) posted 594 big-character posters, raising 755 opinions. The rectification leading group has already processed 543 opinions, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of opinions raised by the masses.

As early as during the peak of the "letting a hundred flowers bloom" period, the rectification leading group organized forces to classify, synthesize, and study the opinions raised by the masses, and put forward solutions for 44 opinions. This plan was discussed by the leading group and administrative leading cadres at the section level and above, and then by all the masses. After the original plan was made more complete, the first batch of solutions to problems was officially announced. Opinions from the masses that were correct and could be corrected immediately were corrected immediately; for opinions from the masses that were correct and should be corrected, but could not be implemented immediately, a correction plan was announced and gradually implemented under the supervision of the masses; some problems caused by the opinion-givers not understanding the situation or misunderstanding were explained publicly.

However, the initial plan for solving the first batch of problems had two shortcomings. Some of the wording of the handling opinions was too simple and blunt, and not humble enough. Also, four handling opinions were rejected by the masses because they were not carefully considered in advance. For example, two big-character posters in the appraisal committee mentioned that the Ministry of Railways' directly subordinate communications section only gave the appraisal committee two long-distance telephone lines, and limited the call time to only five minutes each time. They requested to add a long-distance telephone line and extend the call time to ten minutes each time. The leading group did not carefully investigate their actual needs. After contacting the directly subordinate communications section, they only agreed to add a long-distance telephone line, but did not allow extending the call time. However, during the mass discussion, everyone unanimously believed that the call time should be extended according to work needs. Therefore, the leading group had to contact the directly subordinate communications section again to revise the original plan.

When solving the second batch of more important problems, the leading group learned from this lesson and submitted the problems that could be solved within each section, or problems that could lead to more complete consensus, to the relevant sections for discussion first, and everyone put forward solutions. If a section could not solve it alone, a joint meeting of the relevant sections was held for discussion. After reaching a consistent conclusion, the group leader reported to the leading group, and after the leading group and administrative leading cadres held a meeting to jointly decide, the processing plan was announced. Therefore, the second batch of problem solutions was more substantial and avoided rework.

At present, most of the unresolved problems are more significant issues related to institutional systems. The leading group has summarized these issues and distributed them to various study groups, preparing to concentrate the wisdom of the masses through mass debates, so that the problems can be solved more realistically.

    铁道部基建局和设计预算鉴定委员会决心改进工作
    让群众讨论解决问题的方案
    本报讯　铁道部基本建设局和设计预算鉴定委员会的整改工作已初见成效。
    这两个单位的整风运动是联合在一起进行的。从10月14日到26日，全局（会）七十名工作人员，贴出了大字报五百九十四张，提出意见七百五十五条。整风领导小组已经处理了五百四十三条意见，占群众提出意见总数的70％以上。
    远在鸣放高潮期间，整风领导小组就组织了力量，把群众提出的意见进行了分类、综合和研究，并对四十四条意见提出了解决方案。这个方案经过领导小组和科级以上行政领导干部讨论，再经过全体群众讨论，使得原方案更完备后，才正式公布了第一批问题的解决方案。对群众意见中正确而又能马上改正的，立即改正；对于群众意见正确，应该改正，但目前还不能立即实现的，公布改正计划，由群众监督逐步实现；有些由于提意见人不了解情况或误解而产生的问题，则当众作解释。
    但是，第一批解决问题的初步方案有两个缺点，有的处理意见的措辞过于简单生硬，不够虚心；还有四条处理意见因为事先考虑不周，被群众否决了。比如，鉴定委员会曾有两张大字报提到：铁道部直属通讯段只给鉴委会两台长途电话机，而且限定每次通话时间只有五分钟。他们要求增加一台长途电话机，并把通话时间放宽为每次十分钟。领导小组没有细致地调查他们的实际需要，在同直属通讯段联系后，只答应给他们增加一台长途电话机，而不准放宽通话时间。但在群众讨论中，大家一致认为根据工作需要，应该放宽通话时间。因此领导小组不得不再次同直属通讯段联系，修改了原来的方案。
    在解决第二批比较重要的问题时，领导小组接受了这个教训，把各科室内可以解决的，或是可以得出更完善的一致意见的问题，先交有关各科室讨论，由大家提出解决办法。一个科室不能单独解决的，即由各有关科室开联席会议讨论。到得出一致结论，再由小组长报告领导小组，经领导小组和行政领导干部开会共同商定后，再公布处理方案。因此，第二批问题解决方案就比较充实，也避免了返工现象。
    目前，尚未解决的问题，多数是有关机构体制等较重大的问题，领导小组已把这些问题归纳起来发给各学习小组，准备通过群众性的大辩论，集中群众智慧，以便使问题解决的更切合实际。
