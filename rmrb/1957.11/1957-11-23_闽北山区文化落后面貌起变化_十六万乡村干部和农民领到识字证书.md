The cultural backwardness in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian is changing.
160,000 rural cadres and farmers receive literacy certificates.
    (Our report) Fuzhou Prefecture in Fujian Province has made great achievements in rural literacy work. By the time of this year's autumn harvest, nearly 160,000 rural cadres and farmers had reached the literacy standard and received literacy certificates. Gutian County has now eliminated illiteracy for 29,160 people, accounting for more than 34% of the total number of illiterate young and middle-aged people. According to statistics from three counties, including Shunchang and Jian'ou, out of 8,026 graduates, 641 are township and commune cadres, and 1,330 are Party and Youth League members, accounting for 24.5% of the total number of graduates. Tens of thousands of farmers have participated in spare-time senior primary schools, junior high schools, and township literacy associations.
    Farmers who reached the literacy standard were all jubilant, celebrating their cultural emancipation. On the day that Luofeng Township in Gutian County issued literacy certificates, a meeting of 700 people was held. The farmers beat gongs and drums and presented honorary flowers to the graduates. Chen Lutai, a 56-year-old member of the agricultural cooperative, said with emotion: "I never thought that I, such a rough old man, could receive a 'diploma,' which is even more glorious than passing the imperial examination in the Qing Dynasty!" Members of the Jiaojian Agricultural Cooperative in Shunchang County even performed local traditional dramas to celebrate this great event. Many townships in Pucheng, Jiangle and other counties held literacy exhibitions.
    The large number of farmers who have escaped illiteracy has changed the backwardness of the mountainous areas of northern Fujian, which used to be full of illiterate people. Some townships and communes in Gutian, Minqing and other counties have basically eliminated illiteracy among young farmers. According to preliminary investigations, a total of 37 cultural villages (townships) and cultural cooperatives have emerged in the area. In Xiufeng Township, Gutian County, where villages are scattered, 98% of the people were illiterate before liberation. Currently, 402 people have received literacy certificates, including 298 young people who have all escaped illiteracy and have been praised by the province and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Many agricultural cooperatives' accountants, work recorders, and teachers in people-run schools in all counties of the region are all graduates of people-run schools. Among the more than 4,300 students who graduated in Longxi County this year, 1,973 have become township and commune cadres, cooperative accountants, production team work recorders, and teachers in people-run schools. In Tongmu Township, Chong'an County, all young and middle-aged people were illiterate in the past. In the early days of liberation, when mutual aid teams were organized, no one could be found to record work points. Now, the director and accountant of the advanced cooperative, as well as the captain and work recorder of the production team, are all graduates of people-run schools. Many grassroots cadres at the district and township levels have overcome many difficulties in their past work and improved the quality of their work because they have escaped illiteracy. Jiang Niandeng, the deputy district chief of Daya District in Jian'ou County, now has no problem reading notices and writing plans. He conveys information from county meetings very systematically based on his notebook. The farmers praised him as a good cadre who is both literate and capable. Huang Shiye, the township head of Xiaban Township in Longxi County, realized the importance of rural literacy work even more after escaping illiteracy. He not only managed production and literacy work at the same time, but also recently combined the rural debate to set up three remote natural village literacy groups in previously blank spots.

    闽北山区文化落后面貌起变化
    十六万乡村干部和农民领到识字证书
    本报讯　福建省南平专区农村扫盲工作获得很大成绩。到今年秋收以前为止，将近有十六万名农村干部和农民群众达到扫盲标准，领到了识字证书。古田县现在扫除文盲二万九千一百六十人，占青壮年文盲总数34％强。据顺昌、建瓯等三个县统计，八千零二十六个毕业学员中，乡、社干部有六百四十一人，党团员有一千三百三十人，占毕业学员总数的24．5％。数以万计的农民参加了业余高小、初中和乡里的扫盲协会工作。
    达到扫盲标准的农民，都个个欢欣鼓舞，庆贺自己的文化翻身。古田县罗峰乡领发识字证书那天，召开了七百人的大会，农民们敲锣打鼓，给毕业学员带光荣花，农业社五十六岁老社员陈绿太感动地说：“想不到我这个大老粗，还能领到一张‘文凭’，真比前清考秀才还光采！”顺昌县皎建农业社的社员还演了本地传统的戏剧，欢庆这件大喜事。浦城、将乐等县许多乡举办了扫盲展览会。
    大量的农民群众脱离了文盲状态，使农村文盲充斥的闽北山区的落后面貌起了变化。古田、闽清等县有些乡、社已基本扫除了青年农民中的文盲。据初步调查，全区共出现了三十七个文化村（乡）和文化社。村庄分散的古田县秀峰乡，解放前98％的人不识字，目前有四百零二人先后领到了识字证书，其中二百九十八个青年全部摆脱了文盲状态，受到省和团中央的表扬。全区各县许多农业社的会计、记工员和民校教师都是民校毕业的学员。龙溪县今年毕业的四千三百多个学员中，有一千九百七十三人分别当了乡、社干部、合作社会计、生产队记工员和民校教师。崇安县桐木乡过去青壮年个个是文盲，解放初期，组织互助组时，记工分的人都找不到。现在高级社的社长、会计、生产队的队长、记工员，都是从民校里毕业出来的学员。许多区、乡基层干部由于摆脱了文盲状态，克服了过去工作中的不少困难，提高了工作质量。建瓯县大雅区副区长江年登，现在看通知写计划不成问题，从县里开会回来照笔记本传达得很有条理，农民们都称赞他是个能文能武的好干部。龙溪县下坂乡乡长黄士业摆脱文盲状态后，更加体会到农村扫盲工作的重要性，他不但做到既管生产又搞扫盲，最近结合农村大辩论，还把原来空白点的三个偏僻的自然村民校识字小组办起来。　（苏则林）
