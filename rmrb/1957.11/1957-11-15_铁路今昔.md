    Railways: Then and Now
    More Built: From 1876, when China first had railways, until 1948, 27,112 kilometers of railways were built in the country over 73 years. By the eve of liberation, the country actually had only 24,954.5 kilometers of railways, of which the Kuomintang built only 2,679 kilometers. During the 73 years before liberation, an average of 371.4 kilometers of railways were built annually.
    From the national liberation to the end of 1956, 10,278.6 kilometers of railways were built in seven years, an average of 1,468.4 kilometers per year, which is 3.9 times the annual average of the 73 years before liberation, and 2.8 times the annual average of the period when the Kuomintang and Japanese imperialism built the most roads (i.e., 1931-1937).
    Faster Construction: Before liberation, the 344-kilometer Hangzhou to Yushan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which had flat terrain, took three years and eleven months to complete; the 455-kilometer Zhuzhou to Shaoguan section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway took three years and four months; and the 154-kilometer Baotou-Tianshui Railway took six years and six months, and the quality was very poor, with collapses and road closures, which was known throughout the country. After liberation, the construction speed was: the Baocheng Railway, which is 668 kilometers long, was completed in just four years, despite unprecedented engineering difficulties; the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, which is 720 kilometers long, took only two years and one month to complete.
    Own Funds: The railway construction of New China relies entirely on our country's own funds. Before liberation, most of the funds for road construction were invested by imperialists. According to statistics from 1936, imperialist capital accounted for 90.7% of the country's railways in terms of length. From 1887 to 1937, over 50 years, loans from eight imperialist countries, including Britain, the United States, France, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia, and Belgium, amounted to 100,836,100 silver dollars, in addition to large amounts of interest (some with interest rates as high as 10% per year). Among them, the Kuomintang government borrowed 30,525,000 yuan. Many of the railways built before liberation were also contracted by imperialists, who also defrauded a lot of money from them. For example, the Jidun Railway was contracted by the South Manchuria Railway Company. The actual value of the entire project plus other expenses was only 7.8 million Japanese yen, but the Japanese listed the contract fee as high as 23 million Japanese yen. There are many such examples.
    Own Vehicle Manufacturing: Before liberation, China's railway transportation equipment was also dependent on foreign countries. In the 73 years, except for piecing together more than 20 PK6-type locomotives, there was no locomotive manufacturing to speak of. In the short few years after liberation, we have manufactured 368 new PK1 locomotives and successfully trial-produced new FX6 locomotives, and have also designed and successfully trial-produced 1-5-1 Peace-type giant freight locomotives. Now, the country is also starting to trial-produce electric locomotives. In terms of vehicles, before liberation, only more than 200 wooden-bodied passenger cars and 400 to 500 30-ton freight cars were manufactured using existing chassis; after liberation, we have manufactured 1,862 new passenger cars and nearly 40,000 30-ton to 60-ton freight cars.
    Faster Driving Speed: Before liberation, except for the Harbin-Dalian, Beining, and Shanghai-Nanjing lines, which had higher driving speeds, the driving speed on the remaining lines was less than 50 kilometers per hour. Now, due to the improvement of lines and bridges, the allowable driving speed on major trunk lines is above 70 kilometers per hour. In 1937, it took 37 hours and 4 minutes to travel from Peiping to Shanghai, which the Kuomintang once promoted as remarkable; however, it is more than nine hours slower than our current Beijing-Shanghai express train.
    Higher Equipment Utilization Rate: The utilization efficiency of railway equipment is far beyond what the old Chinese railways could compare with. In terms of freight density per kilometer of line, it has reached 4.54 million ton-kilometers in 1956, exceeding 2.26 times the largest freight volume in the history of old Chinese railways in 1943. The freight car turnaround time has been shortened from more than four days at the beginning of liberation to 2.99 days in 1956; the daily car kilometers of freight locomotives have increased from 278 kilometers to 363 kilometers; and the average traction total weight of freight trains has increased from 1,015 tons to 1,513 tons. These indicators are not only unprecedented in Chinese railway history, but also relatively advanced internationally.
    Looking at the freight ton-kilometers produced per million yuan of fixed assets of the railway. According to data from 1936 before liberation, the freight turnover completed by the railway's fixed assets of one million yuan (converted into RMB) per year was 4.33 million ton-kilometers; now, the freight turnover completed by each million yuan of fixed assets per year is 15.14 million ton-kilometers. That is to say, with the same amount of equipment, the current work completed is 3.5 times that before liberation.
    More Freight: The estimated passenger and freight volume to be completed in 1957 will increase by 3.7 times for passenger volume and 6.6 times for freight volume compared with the Kuomintang's heyday in 1936; compared with the highest year during the Japanese rule in 1943, passenger volume will increase by 0.4 times and freight volume will increase by 2.3 times.
    The railway transportation volume in 1936 was only 70% of the transportation volume of the Beijing Railway Bureau today. The transportation volume of the puppet Manchukuo Railway in 1943 was only about half of the transportation volume of our Northeast Railway last year.
    Lower Cost: In 1950, the cost of each thousand converted ton-kilometers was 9 yuan, 8 jiao, and 4 fen, which was reduced to 7 yuan, 5 jiao, and 1 fen in 1956, a decrease of 23.7%, an average annual decrease of 4.4%. In 1935, when the Kuomintang reactionaries managed the railways, which was considered a relatively good period, the transportation cost of the state-owned railways at that time was converted into the same caliber according to the price index and cost composition, and the cost of each thousand converted ton-kilometers was 28 yuan, 3 jiao, which is equivalent to five times the transportation cost of each bureau within our country in 1956. In 1935, the administrative management expenses of the state-owned railways under the management of the Kuomintang accounted for 23.7% of its total expenditure, while the administrative management expenses of each bureau within our country in 1956 were only 6%. In 1956, the locomotive coal consumption standards of the Beijing Railway Administration and the Shanghai Railway Administration were 40% lower than those of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Administration and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration in 1947. From 1950 to 1956, the average profit rate of our railways was 94.8%, while the average profit rate of the reactionary state-owned railways in 1935 was only 31.8%. Our railway freight rates are generally lower than before the Anti-Japanese War.

专栏：数字与事实

    铁路今昔
    修得多　从我国开始有铁路的1876年起，到1948年止，七十三年间全国修了二万七千一百一十二公里铁路。到解放前夕，全国实际只有铁路二万四千九百五十四点五公里，其中国民党修的只有二千六百七十九公里。解放前的七十三年间，平均每年修建铁路三百七十一点四公里。
    从全国解放到1956年底，七年间修铁路一万零二百七十八点六公里，平均每年修建一千四百六十八点四公里，为解放前七十三年每年平均数的三点九倍，为国民党和日本帝国主义修路最多的一个时期（即1931—1937年）每年平均数的二点八倍。
    修得快　解放以前，浙赣铁路杭州到玉山段三百四十四公里，地势平坦，用了三年零十一个月才修通；粤汉线株州到韶关段四百五十五公里，修了三年零四个月；宝天路全长一百五十四公里，修了六年六个月，而且质量很坏，坍方断道，举国闻名。解放后的施工速度：宝成线全长六百六十八公里，工程的艰巨是空前的，仅仅四年就修通了；鹰厦线全长七百二十公里，仅仅用了二年零一个月的时间。
    自己的资金　新中国的铁路建设，完全依靠我们国家自己的资金。解放前的修路资金，大部分是帝国主义投资。根据1936年统计，当时全国铁路按长度说，属于帝国主义资本的占90．7％。从1887年到1937年，五十年间向英、美、法、日、德、荷、俄、比等八个帝国主义国家借的路款，折合银元十万零八千三百六十一万元，另外还要付出大宗利息（利率有的达到年利10％）。其中国民党政府就借了三万零五百二十五万元。解放前修的铁路，还有不少是由帝国主义承包的，他们从中也诈骗了很多钱。例如吉敦铁路是由满铁会社承包的，全部工程实值加上其他费用，总共不过七百八十万日元，但是日本人竟开列包工费达二千三百万日元之巨。这种例子是很多的。
    自己造车辆　解放以前，我国的铁路运输器材也都仰给于外国。七十三年间，除掉拼凑了二十多台Πㄎ6型机车以外，根本谈不到机车制造。解放以后短短几年间，我们已经制造新型Πㄎ1机车并试制成功新型攵ㄒ6机车等共三百六十八台，同时自己设计和试制成功了1—5—1和平型巨型货运机车。现在，国家又在着手试制电气机车。在车辆方面，解放以前只利用现成的车架制造过二百多辆木质车身的客车，和三十吨的货车四、五百辆；解放以后，我们自己制造了新型客车一千八百六十二辆，三十吨到六十吨的货车近四万辆。
    行车速度快　解放以前，除哈大、北宁和沪宁几条线路行车速度较高以外，其余各线每小时行车速度都不到五十公里。现在由于线路及桥梁的改善，主要干线的行车容许速度都在每小时七十公里以上。1937年平沪通车需要三十七小时零四十分钟，国民党曾宣扬一时，认为很了不起；但是同我们现在的京沪特别快车比起来，却慢九个多小时。
    设备运用率高　目前铁路设备的运用效率，远非旧中国的铁路所能比拟。以每一公里线路的货运密度来说，1956年已经达到四百五十四万吨公里，超过旧中国铁路运量史上最大的1943年二点二六倍。货车周转时间由解放之初的四天以上，缩短到1956年的二点九九天；货运机车日车公里由二百七十八公里提高到三百六十三公里；货运列车平均牵引总重由一千零一十五吨提高到一千五百一十三吨。这些指标不仅在中国铁路历史上是空前的，就是在国际上也是比较先进的。
    再就铁路每百万元固定资产生产的货运吨公里来看。根据解放前1936年的资料，那时铁路固定资产每百万元（折合人民币）每年完成的货物周转量是四百三十三万吨公里；现在，每百万元固定资产每年完成的货物周转量是一千五百一十四万吨公里。就是说，以同样多的设备，目前完成的工作为解放前的三点五倍。
    运货多　1957年预计完成的客货运量同国民党全盛时代的1936年比较，客运量增加三点七倍，货运量增加六点六倍；同日本统治时期最高年1943年比较，客运量增加零点四倍，货运量增加二点三倍。
    1936年的铁路运量，仅及现在北京局一个局运量的70％。1943年伪满铁路的运量，也仅仅相当于去年我国东北铁路运量的一半左右。
    成本低　1950年，每一千个换算吨公里的成本是九元八角四分，到1956年就降低到七元五角一分，等于降低了23．7％，每年平均降低4．4％。1935年是国民党反动派管理铁路时所谓较好的时期，把当时国有铁路的运输成本按物价指数和成本构成换算为同一口径，每一千个换算吨公里的成本合二十八元三角，相当于我们1956年关内各局运输成本的五倍。1935年国民党管理下的国有铁路，行政管理费占其总支出的23．7％，而1956年我们关内各局的行政管理费仅为6％。1956年北京铁路管理局和上海铁路管理局的机煤消耗标准，比1947年平津区铁路管理局和京沪区铁路管理局低40％。从1950年到1956年，我们铁路的平均利润率是94．8％，而1935年反动派国有铁路的平均利润率仅为31．8％。我们的铁路运价一般也比抗日以前低。
