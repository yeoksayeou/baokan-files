    Visiting the Soviet Union – Letters
    Another Day in Irkutsk
    Tian Han
    As I pick up my pen to write this dispatch, it is our second night in Irkutsk. The heavy snow has stopped tonight, and the cold moon is bright and clear, so it seems there shouldn't be any problems. However, the weather station reports that Omsk and Novosibirsk stations are experiencing mixed rain and snow, with low, ominous clouds, making it unsuitable for night flights. As a result, many planes are grounded here, unable to proceed. The Soviet side and our delegation leaders are quite anxious, but for the sake of safety, we have rescheduled our departure for 8:00 AM tomorrow. So tonight, I have the time to take a general tour of Irkutsk under the moonlight. Some comrades couldn't see much at night and also because of the cold, they didn't join, but after seeing it, I feel sorry for those who didn't come.
    This is a medium-sized city comparable to Wuxi in Jiangsu, Luzhou in Sichuan, and Shijiazhuang in Hebei. It has a population of about 320,000. Previously, Siberia was sparsely populated. Some say that the total population of Eastern Siberia in the past was not even as large as today's Irkutsk, which shows that the population growth rate of this city in recent decades has been very high. In addition to Russians, there are also Mongolians, Buryat-Mongolians, and Yakuts, as well as some Chinese who have settled here for a long time. It is said that most of the Chinese are engaged in vegetable cultivation. In the years after liberation, some elderly people returned to China, and some also represented overseas Chinese to return to China for sightseeing.
    This city was founded about 300 years ago, in 1661, at the confluence of the Angara, Baikal, and Irkutsk Rivers. Opposite the West Siberian city of Novosibirsk, it is a commercial thoroughfare to China and Mongolia. It is also the economic, scientific, and cultural center of Eastern Siberia. It has heavy machinery factories and various light industrial factories, as well as food processing plants; it has six colleges including mining and metallurgy, agriculture, normal school, finance and economics, and medicine; it has a branch of the National Academy of Sciences; and it has the Zhdanov University, established in 1938, which includes eight departments. The reason it has become a scientific city is because in recent years gold, coal, mineral springs, and mineral blocks have been discovered in Buryat-Mongolia and the Chita Oblast. This is a famous forest area, containing a large area of virgin forest; the forest area is 68 kilometers from the city, and the scenery along Lake Baikal is lush and beautiful. It also contains a large amount of hydropower potential. The drop from the Angara River into the Yenisei River is 360 meters. Therefore, there are plans to build ten terraced hydropower stations. The completed Angara Hydropower Station has a generating capacity of 660,000 kilowatts; another hydropower station 300 kilometers away has a generating capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts.
    This small city of 320,000 people has an art school, four theaters, and six cinemas in terms of art and culture. The theaters include a musical comedy theater, a drama theater, a young audience theater, and a concert hall, which we don't even have in Beijing yet. The drama theater is said to be the oldest, with a history of 207 years. It was originally made of wood, and after being burned down once, it was rebuilt after 1785 and has been standing ever since. It has staged many famous plays. Recently, it staged Shakespeare's "Othello," but unfortunately, I did not have the time to see it.

    访苏书简
    伊尔库次克的又一日
    田汉
    当我提笔写这个通信的时候是我们在伊尔库次克的第二晚。今晚大雪已止，寒月皎洁，看起来应该没有问题的了。但气象台报告，鄂木斯克、新西伯利亚各站雨雪交加，阵云低沉，不适于夜航，因此很多飞机都停在这里，不能前进。苏联方面和我们团领导都十分焦急，但为安全第一，改定明天早八时起飞。所以今晚有工夫在月光灯影之下把伊尔库次克全市大体巡览一回。有些同志晚上看不到什么，又兼天冷，没有参加，但看过之后很替不来的同志们可惜。
    这是一个跟江苏的无锡，四川的泸州，河北的石家庄相当的中小城市。人口约三十二万。以前西伯利亚人烟稀少，有人说从前东西伯利亚的总人口也赶不上今天的伊尔库斯克，可知这几十年来这个城市人口的增加率是很高的。这里俄罗斯人以外还有蒙古人，布利亚特·蒙古人，雅若特人，也还有些在这里长远落业的中国人，中国人据说多以种菜为业，解放后这几年有些年老的回国了，有的也曾代表侨民回国观光。
    这座城市建于距今约三百年前的1661年，当安哥拉河、贝加拉河、伊尔库次河的汇集点。与西伯利亚西部的新西伯利亚市相对峙，这里是通中国、蒙古的商业要道。又是东部西伯利亚经济科学文化的中心，它拥有重型机器厂和各种轻工业工厂，食物加工厂；有采矿冶金、农业、师范、财经、医学等六大学院，有全国科学院分院；有1938年建立的包含八个学系的日丹诺夫大学。这里之所以成为科学城是因为这几年在布利亚特·蒙古，在赤塔州，发现了黄金、煤、矿泉和矿块，这里是著名的森林区，包含一大片原生林；离城六十八公里就是林区，沿贝加尔湖一带郁郁苍苍风物优美。这里也蕴藏着大量水力发电能力。由安哥拉河流入叶尼塞河的落差是三百六十公尺。因此计划修建十个梯形的水电站。已修成的安哥拉水电站发电量是六十六万瓩；离此三百公里的另一水电站发电量是一百二十万瓩。
    这三十二万人的小城市在艺术文化方面有一个艺术学校，四个剧场，六所电影院。剧场包含一个音乐喜剧院，一个话剧院，一个少年观众剧院，一个音乐厅，这是我们北京也还没有的。话剧院据说是最老的，有二百零七年的历史。原先是木造的，一度被火烧之后，1785年后重修，直到现在，演过许多有名的戏，最近演出莎士比亚的“奥塞罗”，可惜我没有观摩的余裕。
