Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 24th: Indonesian First Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Hardi said in Congress on the 22nd that the Indonesian government cannot agree to the claim that the dual nationality treaty between Indonesia and China needs to be reconsidered, nor can it agree to postponing the implementation of this treaty until Indonesia's nationality law is promulgated. He said that the government's reason for requesting the passage of a bill to approve this treaty is to resolve the issue of those Indonesian citizens who simultaneously hold Chinese nationality.

Hardi also expressed his agreement to attach the documents exchanged between former Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to this bill.

Hardi also answered a question raised that day by a member of parliament regarding Chiang Kai-shek group elements in Surabaya engaging in so-called celebrations of "National Day" on October 10th, with the participation of Indonesian government officials. He said that the Indonesian government will investigate this matter and take measures. Hardi also revealed that the government intends to set a maximum limit on the number of foreign nationals residing in Indonesia.

    印度尼西亚第一副总理表示
    同中国订的双重国籍条约不能重新考虑或推迟批准
    新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚第一副总理兼代理外交部长哈迪22日在国会说，印度尼西亚政府不能同意关于印度尼西亚和中国之间的双重国籍条约需要重新考虑的主张，也不能同意推迟到印度尼西亚的国籍法颁布以后才执行这项条约的主张。他说，政府所以要求通过批准这项条约的法案，目的在于解决同时保有中国国籍的那一部分印度尼西亚公民的问题。
    哈迪还表示同意把阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约前总理和中国周恩来总理互换的文件附在这项法案里。
    哈迪还回答了当天一个议员提出的关于泗水的蒋介石集团分子在10月10日从事所谓庆祝“国庆”的活动，并且有印度尼西亚政府官员参加的问题。他说，印度尼西亚政府要调查这件事，并且要采取措施。哈迪还透露，政府打算制订一个外国侨民居留印度尼西亚的最高限额。
