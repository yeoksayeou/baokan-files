Changing the Face of the Jiangxi Mountainous Areas
By Our Correspondent Li Lianbin

The mountainous areas of Jiangxi Province cover more than 150 million mu, accounting for more than 60% of the province's total area.

After liberation in 1949, the Party and the government helped the people in the mountainous areas of Jiangxi to rebuild their homes, restore and develop production. In many places, grain production has been restored to and exceeded the highest historical levels. Some grain-deficient areas, such as Jinggangshan, had to transport about 100,000 jin of grain from the foot of the mountain every year before 1954. However, from 1955 to the present, more than 100,000 jin of grain have been transferred from the mountain to the foot of the mountain every year. New houses have been built in all mountainous areas. In Jinggangshan, which is world-renowned, and Qigong Town, the hometown of martyr Fang Zhimin, it is almost impossible to see thatched huts.

However, after all, due to the brutal destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the mountain economy and production have not been fully restored to the highest historical level. Is it true that "socialism cannot go up the mountain"? No. Not to mention the rich mineral deposits buried at the bottom of the mountains, the mountains themselves are full of resources, from industrial raw materials to construction materials, from oil crops to non-staple foods. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery can all be developed. It is the common aspiration of the people in the mountainous areas to build the vast mountainous areas into "mountains of treasure." Shao Shiping, the Governor of Jiangxi Province, said: "During the Second Five-Year Plan, in addition to further developing grain and cotton production, we should also comprehensively develop production. We should 'go up the mountain' and 'go into the water.' What does 'going up the mountain' mean? It means to comprehensively develop the mountain economy and make full use of the province's rich resources. What does 'going into the water' mean? It means to make full use of the province's rivers, lakes, and ponds, which are equivalent to more than 20 million mu, and actively develop aquaculture and other aquatic undertakings."

A Beautiful Vision

The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have formulated a ten-year plan from 1958 to 1967 in accordance with the spirit of the Central Government. This plan will present a beautiful vision for the mountainous areas – the old revolutionary base areas.

First, vigorously develop diversified forestry production. The plan is to afforest 45 million mu in ten years, achieving comprehensive greening. In remote mountainous areas, focus on developing timber forests such as fir, pine, eucalyptus, palm, oak, camphor, and bamboo; in near-mountain areas, focus on developing economic forests such as oil tea, tung oil, mulberry, chestnut, fruit trees, and tea forests. The output of tea oil will increase from the current 50 million jin to 180 million jin; the output of tea will increase from the current 93,000 dan to 550,000 dan; the output of tung oil will increase from the current 6.5 million jin to 35 million jin. Advocate “fruit trees going up the mountain” and develop sericulture.

Second, vigorously develop the production of livestock and poultry in mountainous areas. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, it is required that the mountainous areas of the province develop 50 million Angora rabbits, producing 25 million jin of wool; the number of pigs will increase from the current 2 million to 4 million; the number of cattle will increase from the current 1.1 million to 1.6 million. During the Third Five-Year Plan period, it is required that the number of Angora rabbits will reach 100 million, producing 50 million jin of wool; the number of pigs will reach 6 million, and the number of cattle will increase to 2.1 million. In addition, develop fine-wool sheep. By 1962, it is required to develop 100,000 heads, and by 1967, to develop 700,000 heads. Also, actively develop bee and poultry production according to local conditions.

Third, vigorously develop the production of industrial raw materials and local specialties in mountainous areas. The production of mushrooms, pulp, native paper, Xuan paper, medicinal materials, wood ear, bamboo shoots, rosin, and palm bark should all be vigorously developed.

Find Every Possible Way to Develop Mountainous Areas

In order to realize this plan, the party and government leading organs of Jiangxi Province are finding every possible way and method. The main ones are as follows:

First, carry out a major debate centered on "comprehensively developing the mountain economy and building prosperous and happy new socialist mountainous areas" so that cadres and the broad masses of people can recognize the importance of mountain production, the rich resources of the mountains, the infinite potential, and the broad prospects; actively respond to the call of the Party and the government, participate in the work and labor production of developing the mountain economy, and form a powerful army to attack the barren mountains.

Second, implement the policy of combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries to develop diversified production. The focus of mountain production is the development of forestry production. However, forestry production, especially timber forests, is a long-term production, which takes twenty to thirty years to generate income. Therefore, in order to develop forestry, it is necessary to first develop production that can generate profits in the current year or in the short term, and use production that generates profits in the current year and in the short term to support production that generates profits in many years and in the long term. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a combination of agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline industries and forestry.

Third, establish state-owned forest farms and state-owned comprehensive agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery reclamation farms to open up socialist bases in mountainous areas. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, twenty state-owned forest farms will be established in batches. In 1958, the province will first establish state-owned forest farms in seven large mountainous areas such as Nanchang to create experience for state-owned forest farms. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the state requires Jiangxi state-owned farms to reclaim 2 million mu of wasteland, and all the barren mountains and wastelands connected together should be reclaimed during the reclamation. The nearby rivers, lakes, and ponds should be used for fish farming. In this way, not only is wasteland reclaimed, but also diversified production is developed.

Fourth, solve the difficulty of insufficient labor in mountainous areas. First of all, educate the people in mountainous areas, be determined to build the mountainous areas well, and prevent and correct the phenomenon of not being content with production in mountainous areas and blindly flowing into the plains and cities. Take various measures to encourage people to go up the mountains for production. Organize a group of cadres and workers to go up the mountains to participate in the construction and production of state-owned forest farms. Transfer labor from areas with a large population and little land to engage in mountain production by means of inserting communes or branch communes, and organize labor reform forest farms and labor education forest farms where conditions permit.

Everyone believes that the people of Jiangxi, who have a revolutionary tradition, will surely achieve great achievements in building prosperous and happy new socialist mountainous areas.

    改变江西山区面貌
    本报记者　李连斌
    江西山区的面积达一亿五千多万亩，占全省总面积的60％多。
    1949年解放以后，党和政府帮助江西山区人民重建家园、恢复和发展生产，许多地方粮食生产已经恢复到和超过历史上的最高水平。有些缺粮地区，如井岗山，1954年以前，每年都要从山下运十万斤左右粮食上山，但是，从1955年到现在，每年都从山上调出十几万斤粮食下山。各山区普遍盖了新屋，举世闻名的井岗山、方志敏烈士故乡的漆工镇几乎见不到茅棚子了。
    但是，毕竟因为国民党反动派摧残惨重，山区经济和生产还没有全面恢复到历史上的最高水平。是不是“社会主义上不了山”呢？不是的。埋在山底下的丰富矿藏不要说，就是山上生长的东西，从工业原料、到建设用材，从油料作物到副食品等，应有尽有，农、林、畜、渔都可发展。把辽阔的山区建设成为“万宝山”，这是山区人民共同的愿望。江西省长邵式平说：“在第二个五年计划期间，除了进一步发展粮、棉生产以外还应该全面地发展生产，应该‘上山’，
  ‘下水’。什么叫‘上山’呢？就是要全面开发山区经济，充分利用全省的丰富资源；什么叫‘下水’呢？就是充分利用全省相当于二千多万亩面积的江、河、湖、塘，积极发展养鱼等水产事业。”
  美丽的远景
    中共江西省委、省人民委员会已经根据中央的精神，制定出1958年到1967年的十年规划。使山区——革命老根据地呈现一幅美丽的远景。
    第一、大力发展多种林业生产。十年中计划造林四千五百万亩，达到全面绿化。远山地区着重发展杉、松、桉、棕、栎、樟、竹等用材林生产；近山地区，着重发展油茶、油桐、桑树、板栗、果树和茶叶林等经济林的生产。茶油的产量由现在的五千万斤增长到一亿八千万斤；茶叶的产量由现在的九万三千担增长到五十五万担；桐油产量由现在的六百五十万斤，增长到三千五百万斤。提倡果树上山”，发展蚕桑。
    第二、大力发展山区的家畜、家禽的生产。要求第二个五年计划期间，全省山区发展安格拉毛兔五千万头，产毛二千五百万斤；生猪由现在的二百万头增加到四百万头；牛由现在的一百一十万头增加到一百六十万头。要求在第三个五年计划期间，安格拉兔发展到一亿头，产毛五千万斤；生猪发展到六百万头，牛增加到二百一十万头。另外，发展细毛羊。到1962年要求发展到十万头，到1967年发展到七十万头。还要因地制宜地积极发展蜜蜂和家禽的生产。
    第三、大力发展山区的工业原料和土特产品的生产。香菇、纸浆、土纸、宣纸、药材、木耳、竹笋、松脂、棕皮都应大力发展。
      千方百计开发山区
    为了实现这一规划，江西省的党政领导机关正千方百计地寻找门路和办法。主要有以下四项：
    第一、开展以“全面开发山区经济、建设繁荣幸福的社会主义新山区”为内容的大辩论，使干部和广大群众认识到山区生产的重要性，认识到山区有丰富的资源，无穷的潜力，广阔的前途；积极响应党和政府的号召，参加开发山区经济的工作和劳动生产，组成一支强大的向荒山进攻的大军。
    第二、贯彻农、林、牧、副业相结合，发展多种生产的方针。山区生产的重点是发展林业生产。但是林业生产，特别是用材林都是多年性的生产，需要二十年到三十年才有收益。因此，为了发展林业，必须首先发展当年或短期就能获利的生产，以当年和短期获利的生产支持多年和长期获利的生产。因此，必须发展农、牧、副业和林业多种经营相结合的生产。
    第三、建立国营林场和国营农、林、牧、渔综合垦殖场，开辟山区的社会主义基地。在第二个五年计划期间，分批建立二十个国营林场。1958年首先由省在南昌等地七个大山区建立国营林场，为国营林场创造经验。在第二个五年计划期间，国家要求江西国营农场开荒二百万亩，在垦荒中要把连在一起的荒山、荒地全部开垦起来。附近的江、河、湖、塘利用起来养鱼。这样，不但开了荒，而且发展了多种生产。
    第四、解决山区劳动力不足的困难。首先，教育山区人民，决心建设好山区，防止和纠正不安心山区生产和盲目流入平原地区和城市的现象。采取各种办法，鼓励人民上山生产。组织一批干部和工人上山参加国营林场的建设和生产。以插社或分社的办法抽调人多田少地区的劳动力从事山区生产，在有条件的地方组织劳动改造林场和劳动教养林场。
    大家相信，负有革命传统的江西人民，建设繁荣幸福的社会主义新山区，一定能取得伟大的成就。
