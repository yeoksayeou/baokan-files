    Celebrate the Fortieth Anniversary of the October Revolution with Greater Enthusiasm and Practical Action
    Huang Yanpei
    All socialist countries, countries friendly to socialist countries, and working people around the world are enthusiastically celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. And what about our China?
    Our China celebrates the October Socialist Revolution enthusiastically every year, but what about our China in 1957!
    China in 1957 is celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution with a special feeling and greater enthusiasm. Where does this special feeling manifest itself? And why?
    First, New China is carrying out socialist construction, and on October 1, 1957, it was announced that the First Five-Year Plan had been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded its targets.
    Our socialist construction is based on the historical experience of Soviet socialist construction, combined with China's specific conditions. Our policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and correspondingly developing light industry, agriculture, and handicrafts, bringing the national economy into the planned orbit, and practicing increased production and thrift are all measures adopted by drawing on the useful experience of the Soviet Union for us. During the course of our construction, the Soviet Union, with the spirit of internationalism, provided us with comprehensive and selfless assistance. The 156 large-scale projects that the Soviet Union helped us build are the center of industrial construction in our First Five-Year Plan. Without the Soviet Union's help, it would be unimaginable for our First Five-Year Plan to achieve such great success.
    Second, China's socialist revolution in 1957 is proceeding from the basis of the victory already achieved on the economic front to the revolution on the political and ideological fronts.
    It is generally accepted that our socialist revolution is a continuation of the October Revolution. The elimination of capitalist ownership of the means of production and the elimination of classes are based on the basic experience of the Soviet Union; at the same time, combining China's historical conditions and the political attitude of the national bourgeoisie, we adopted the redemption policy mentioned by Lenin. Through the redemption policy, all capitalist industry and commerce in our country were transformed into joint state-private enterprises in the 1956 transformation high tide, completing the transformation of enterprises and basically changing the capitalist ownership of the means of production.
    The historical lessons of the Soviet Union tell us that after the question of ownership of the means of production is resolved, the class struggle on the political and ideological fronts will not be extinguished in a short period of time. After the elimination of the exploitation system, the Soviet Union has been fighting against Trotsky, Zinoviev, Bukharin, Rykov, and other right-wing elements, and it was not until 1937 that the Bukharin-Trotsky right-wing alliance was finally crushed. The Hungarian working-class regime, which was once usurped by the bourgeoisie, has also given us the same lesson. But the lessons of the Soviet Union and Hungary also tell us that as long as the people firmly support the leadership of the working-class party and firmly follow the socialist road, these enemies of the people will eventually fail. The Chinese national bourgeoisie has its own special circumstances, but these lessons are still of practical significance to the current socialist revolution in our country, especially the Hungarian incident in 1956.
    One more point: In today's fortieth anniversary commemoration of the October Socialist Revolution, seeing the amazing achievements of the Soviet Union, these achievements prove that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and by taking the socialist road can they be achieved. Our entire China is launching a comprehensive rectification movement. Facing these vivid facts, is it still permissible for anyone to raise any doubts about which is superior between the two roads of capitalism and socialism? Which way to go?
    Then, how should we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution? We must celebrate with practical action. How should we take practical action?
    First of all, we must work harder to build socialism. This means loving the cause of socialism, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, everyone should bring into play all positive factors that are conducive to socialist construction. From the perspective of the industrial and commercial sectors, it means contributing their production technology and business experience that are beneficial to socialist construction—actively participating in the movement to increase production and practice thrift and socialist labor emulation, and striving to exceed the targets of the First Five-Year Plan and the upcoming Second Five-Year Plan.
    Secondly, we must actively participate in the rectification movement, including the anti-rightist struggle. This means making up our minds to break with the capitalist stand, establish a socialist stand, and around the major issues of right and wrong, carry out criticism and self-criticism in a gentle and serious manner, and jointly pass this test of the socialist revolution in politics and ideology. We must thoroughly expose and resolutely criticize the right-wing elements, present the facts, reason things out, and fight them to the end.
    Great! Great! How powerfully does this great commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution inspire our confidence and courage in these tasks!
    Is it enough to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution with these practical actions? No!
    We must see that our territory of Taiwan, which is under the fierce control of the American aggressors, has not yet been liberated; we must see that American imperialism is inciting Turkey to launch a war of aggression against Syria, which shows that the danger of war has not been eliminated, and we must be vigilant at all times. However, what are the results of the growth and consolidation of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, especially the recent successful tests of Soviet intercontinental missiles and artificial satellites? What the imperialist countries have received is panic and shock, and what the socialist countries have received is encouragement and unity.
    Finally, let us shout:
    Long live the October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live the socialist countries!
    Long live socialist People's Republic of China!
    Long live world peace!

### 用更高度的热情结合实际行动来庆祝十月革命四十周年

    用更高度的热情结合实际行动来庆祝十月革命四十周年
    黄炎培
    全世界社会主义国家、社会主义国家的友好国家、全世界劳动人民，都在热烈庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年，而我们中国呢？
    我们中国年年热烈庆祝十月社会主义革命，而今年1957年的我们中国呢！
    今年1957年的中国，正在以特殊的心情，更高度热烈地庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年。这特殊的心情，从那里表现出来的呢？为的是什么呢？
    第一、新中国正在进行社会主义建设，而1957年10月1日已经宣布提早并超额完成了第一个五年计划。
    我国社会主义建设是根据苏联社会主义建设的历史经验，结合我国具体条件来进行的。我国优先发展重工业相应地发展轻工业和农业、手工业的方针，把国民经济纳入计划轨道，厉行增产节约，这种种措施，都是吸取苏联对我们有用的经验而确定的。在我国建设过程中，苏联更以国际主义的精神，给我们全面无私的援助。苏联帮助我们建设的一百五十六项规模巨大的工程，是我国第一个五年计划工业建设的中心。没有苏联这种种帮助，我国第一个五年计划要取得这样巨大的成就，那是不能想像的。
    第二、1957年中国的社会主义革命，正从经济战线已经取得胜利的基础上，进行政治战线和思想战线上的革命。
    我国社会主义革命公认是十月革命的继续。消灭生产资料的资本主义所有制和消灭阶级，这是根据苏联的基本经验的；同时，结合了我国的历史条件和民族资产阶级的政治态度，采取了列宁所提到的赎买政策。通过赎买政策，我国资本主义工商业在1956年改造高潮中，全部实行了公私合营，完成了企业改造，基本上改变了生产资料的资本主义所有制。
    苏联的历史经验教训告诉我们：生产资料所有制问题解决之后，在政治战线和思想战线上的阶级斗争，是不会在短时期内熄灭的。苏联在消灭剥削制度以后，一直同托洛茨基、季诺维也夫、布哈林、李可夫等右派分子进行斗争，直到1937年才把布哈林、托洛茨基右派联盟最后粉碎。匈牙利工人阶级政权，曾一度被资产阶级所篡夺，也同样给了我们这条经验教训。但是苏联和匈牙利的经验教训又告诉我们：只要人民坚决拥护工人阶级政党的领导，坚决走社会主义道路，这些人民的敌人，最后一定是要失败的。中国的民族资产阶级，是有它的特殊情况，但这些经验教训，对于我国当前政治上思想上的社会主义革命，还是有现实意义的，特别是去年1956年的匈牙利事件。
    还有一点：在今天十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念声中，看到苏联那么惊人的成就，这些成就，证明只有共产党领导，走社会主义道路才能取得的。我们全中国正在展开全面整风运动，面向着这些活生生的事实，对资本主义和社会主义两条道路谁优？谁劣？何去？何从？还允许任何人提出任何怀疑吗？
    那么，我们庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年，用什么来庆祝呢？必须用实际行动来庆祝，怎样实际行动呢？
    首先，我们必须更努力社会主义建设。这就是热爱社会主义事业，在中国共产党领导下，大家发挥有利于社会主义建设的一切积极因素，从工商界说来，是贡献自己的有益于社会主义建设的生产技术和业务经验，——积极参加增产节约运动和社会主义劳动竞赛，为争取更多超额完成第一个五年计划和即将开始的第二个五年计划而努力。
    其次，我们必须积极投入包括反右派斗争在内的整风运动。这就是痛下决心，破掉资本主义立场，建立社会主义立场，围绕着大是大非，既和风细雨地、又认真严肃地展开批评和自我批评，共同过好政治上思想上社会主义革命这一关。对右派分子必须根据彻底揭露，坚决批判的方针，摆事实、讲道理，同他们斗争到底。
    伟大！伟大！十月社会主义革命四十周年这一伟大纪念，鼓舞我们对这些工作的信心和勇气多么有力！
    拿这些实际行动来庆祝十月革命四十周年，够了吗？不！
    我们必须看到在美国侵略者凶恶地控制下的我国领土台湾还没有解放；我们必须看到美帝国主义正在煽动土耳其对叙利亚进行侵略战争的阴谋活动，这说明战争危机并没有消灭，我们必须随时随地提高警惕。但是，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的壮大和巩固，特别是最近苏联洲际导弹和人造卫星的试验成功，结果是什么呢？帝国主义国家所得到的是惊惶，是震动，社会主义国家所得到的是鼓舞，是团结。
    最后让我们高呼：
    十月社会主义革命万岁！
    社会主义国家万岁！
    中华人民共和国社会主义万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
