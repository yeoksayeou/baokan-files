    Hainan Administrative Region Cadres Criticize Rightist Ideology
    Determined to Strive for Early Achievement of Agricultural Program Targets

    (Our Newspaper News) The Hainan Administrative Region has full determination and confidence to achieve the targets proposed by the National Agricultural Development Program before 1967. This is the determination expressed by cadres at the four levels of city, county, township, and commune on Hainan Island at an expanded cadre meeting recently convened by the Hainan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
    The meeting believes that to strive for the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program, it is first necessary to achieve self-sufficiency in grain within three years and strive for the production and income of most agricultural cooperatives to catch up with the level of well-to-do middle peasants. This will free up more strength to complete the task of developing 2.7 million mu of tropical crops by 1962. To achieve these three central targets, it is also necessary to basically eliminate ordinary droughts within three years, complete the basic construction of fertilizers, and achieve an average of three pigs per household.
    The meeting also pointed out that there are sufficient conditions to complete the above tasks. During the First Five-Year Plan period, Hainan experienced three years of individual farming, one year of newly established cooperatives, and one year of right-leaning conservatism, and suffered two floods and typhoons, one drought, and one frost disaster, but still achieved four consecutive years of bumper harvests. Qiongdong and Lehui emerged as two surplus grain counties, and Nada emerged as a place with an average household income of 753 yuan, catching up with the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants. Thousand-斤 mu (high yield mu), thousand-斤 communes, and thousand-斤 townships have been increasing year by year. Although production decreased in 1955, the total grain output still increased by 100 million 斤 compared to before liberation. After two years of cooperative management and the recent rectification movement, the foundation of agricultural cooperatives has been further consolidated, and there is more experience. Therefore, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, it is entirely possible to accelerate the pace and vigorously develop.
    However, not all cadres present at the meeting recognized these favorable conditions. When accepting tasks, many cadres emphasized that the masses were not accustomed to technological reforms, emphasized the lack of labor, and that it was difficult to expand cultivated land area and increase yields. The meeting launched a major debate on production and construction targeting these right-leaning conservative ideas. Many technological reform measures that were implemented last year were not popularized this year and did not persist. Technological reforms in many places have regressed, and the benefited area of water conservancy projects has decreased. These facts made cadres realize the harm of right-leaning thought. During the debate, various counties also further boosted the enthusiasm of cadres through specific accounting methods. Wenchang County, the county with the most grain shortage in the region, only needs to increase grain production by 20 斤 per mu next year, and 70% of the county's agricultural population can become self-sufficient. Digging 20 cubic meters of earth per person per year can eliminate drought within five years. After such a discussion, the cadres were very enthusiastic and happily accepted the tasks. Haikou, Lehui, and Wanning also expressed their intention to eliminate drought within two years. Everyone has more confidence in achieving three pigs per household within three years.
    After criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, the meeting also focused on exchanging experiences in water conservancy construction, agricultural production, and afforestation.

### 海南行政区干部批判了右倾思想  决心争取提前实现农业纲要指标

    海南行政区干部批判了右倾思想
    决心争取提前实现农业纲要指标
    本报讯  海南行政区有充分的决心和信心在1967年前实现全国农业发展纲要所提出的指标。这是海南岛市、县、乡、社四级干部，在中共海南区委员会最近召开的扩大干部会议上表示的决心。
    会议认为，要争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要，首先要在三年内作到粮食自给；争取大多数农业社的生产和收入赶上富裕中农的水平。这样就可以腾出更多的力量，在1962年内完成发展热带作物二百七十万亩的任务。为了实现这三个中心指标，还必须在三年内基本消灭普通旱灾；完成肥料的基本建设；做到平均每户三猪。
    会议还指出，完成上述任务具有充分的条件。在第一个五年计划期间，海南是三年单干，一年新办社，一年右倾保守，并且遭受了二次水灾和风灾，一次旱灾和霜灾，但仍然获得连续四年的丰收，出现了琼东、乐会两个余粮县，和一个平均每户收入七百五十三元、赶上富裕中农生活水平的那大。千斤亩、千斤社、千斤乡逐年都有增加。1955年虽然减产，粮食总产量也还比解放前增加一亿斤。经过两年办社和最近开展的整风运动，农业社的基础进一步巩固，有了更多的经验，因而在第二个五年计划期内，完全可以加快速度大力发展。
    但是，这些有利情况并不是所有的到会干部都认识的。在接受任务时，不少干部都强调技术改革群众没有习惯，强调缺乏劳动力，难以扩大耕地面积和提高产量。会议针对这些右倾保守思想展开了生产建设的大辩论。去年许多技术改革措施，今年都没有普及下去，坚持下来。不少地方的技术改革倒退了，兴修水利的受益面积减少了，通过这些事实，使干部认识到右倾思想的危害性。在辩论中，各县还通过具体的算账办法，进一步鼓足干部劲头。全区缺粮最多的文昌县，明年只要每亩增产二十斤粮食，全县70％的农业人口就可以自给。每人每年挖二十个土方，就可以在五年内消灭旱灾。这样一讨论，干部劲头很大，都愉快地接受任务。海口、乐会、万宁还表示争取在二年内消灭旱灾。大家对在三年内实现一户三猪，更具有充分的信心。
    会议在批判右倾保守思想后，还着重交流了兴修水利、农业生产和造林等方面的经验。
