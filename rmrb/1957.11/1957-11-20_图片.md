　　In the past, the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Muyu Township, Nanzhang County, Hubei Province, only focused on the leadership of production teams on the plains, neglecting the leadership of production teams in the mountains. During this rectification, after the cooperative members raised their opinions, the cooperative sent the cooperative director to the mountains to provide specific leadership. This photo shows them in the mountains studying and planning how to convert more slopes into terraced fields.

    湖北省南漳县沐浴乡前进农业社过去只重视对平原生产队的领导，忽视对山上生产队的领导。这次整改中社员们提了意见后，社里派了社主任上山去进行具体领导。这是他们在山上研究和规划如何把坡地更多的改成梯田。
