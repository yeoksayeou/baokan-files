Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 14th: The people of Czechoslovakia are deeply mourning the death of President Zápotocký with profound grief.

On the morning of the 13th, when the radio announced the news of the President's death, people everywhere were saddened by the loss of such a leader, mentor, and dear friend. In Prague, many people hung black flags or half-masted flags at their doorsteps early in the morning, and draped black纱 on the President's photos. Factories across the city stopped work for a few minutes in the morning, and workers solemnly removed their hats and observed a moment of silence as the whistles wailed in mourning.

The North Bohemian coal mines were immersed in grief, with many miners familiar with the President. During the great strike at the Most coal mine in 1932, President Zápotocký, along with the late President Gottwald, stood at the forefront of leading the strike. All enterprises in this area held gatherings early in the morning of the 13th to mourn and set up memorial tablets for President Zápotocký, with people taking turns to stand guard. The Gorky Mine in this mining area completed its annual production target on the 13th, and seven miners submitted applications to join the Party, aiming to commemorate the President with better work.

Notable industrial enterprises such as the Lenin Machinery Factory in Pilsen, the Jawa motorcycle factory in Strakonice, and the Svit shoe factory in Gottwaldov stopped work for a few minutes to observe a moment of silence or hold memorial gatherings. During the gatherings, workers specifically mentioned the words President Zápotocký had spoken to them during his past visits to the factories.

In Vysoké nad Jizerou (a place where Zápotocký often came for vacation), the rural school staff gathered on the 13th, expressing their determination to educate students in accordance with the President's ideas and teachings.

In addition, workers, farmers, scientists, students, and officers and soldiers of the armed forces in Brno, Bratislava, and other places held memorial services to pay tribute to the spirit of their beloved President.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Government of the Republic, and the President's wife received hundreds of condolence messages from all over the country.

In their telegrams, the working people pledged to dedicate all their strength to the cause that the late President had devoted his life to.
