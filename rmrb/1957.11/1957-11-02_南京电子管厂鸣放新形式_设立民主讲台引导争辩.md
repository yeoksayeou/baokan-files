Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th - Xinhua News Agency reporter Jiang Qingping reports: During the rectification phase, the Nanjing Electronic Tube Factory, to continue vigorously promoting free airing of views, big debates, and extensive airing of views, under the leadership of the Party committee, organized democratic platforms to encourage workers to debate specific issues such as streamlining institutions, transferring cadres to lower levels, planning management, production preparation, and workers' welfare. This form supplements the shortcomings of the big-character poster format, allowing for deeper and more thorough airing of specific issues, which is more conducive to thorough resolution.

Since the start of the rectification movement over fifty days ago, workers at this factory have posted more than three thousand big-character posters, raising over nine thousand opinions through various forms. During the rectification phase, the democratic platform further encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers for big airing of views, big debates, and extensive airing of views. More and more people are taking the stage to speak, and the democratic platforms quickly increased from two to four. As soon as the day's intense labor ends, workers flock from workshops and sections to the democratic platforms set up on the lawn. Some hold speeches, others bring many physical objects from the workshop, ready to express their opinions and debate many important issues on the democratic platform.

Workers are very concerned about the development of production during the rectification. Therefore, the debate on the second democratic platform about "Why can't the Third Workshop comprehensively complete the plan?" was the most heated. The Third Workshop is the assembly workshop, and their performance greatly influences the factory's production targets; and the quality of parts manufactured by each workshop, and whether the parts are supplied in time, directly affects the completion of the Third Workshop's plan. In the debate on the democratic platform, in order to clarify the responsibility of the Third Workshop for not being able to fully complete the plan, the workers, with a sense of ownership, fully prepared themselves, starting from the goal of improving production.

In order to further uncover the problems and difficulties existing in production, many workers in the Third Workshop sacrificed Sundays and rest time to prepare speeches, and some held group meetings to study the points of the speeches. A few hours before the democratic platform debate on October 13, veteran workers Ma Guodong and Rong Jinli also found various types of defective electronic tubes from the waste product warehouse and the workshop, and set up a small defective product exhibition next to the democratic platform, explaining the causes and those responsible for the defective products in writing.

Workers in the Second Workshop also held many group meetings to carefully study and analyze the criticisms raised by the Third Workshop. The core column workshop, which has the closest relationship with the Third Workshop and received the most opinions from the Third Workshop, immediately took improvement measures on some correct opinions raised by the Third Workshop; they also collected materials to debate some opinions they could not agree with.

On the democratic platform, workers conducted debates and visited each other. Veteran worker Ma Guodong from the Third Workshop has more than ten years of experience in glass processing. During the debate, he went to the core column workshop of the Second Workshop to understand the operation situation. Li Chunsheng and Hu Guoqing from the core column workshop of the Second Workshop also went to the Third Workshop to observe the workers' operations and study the causes of defective products. This promoted the rapid resolution of the problem.

On other democratic platforms, debates were also held on how to streamline institutions and how to transfer personnel to lower levels.

Workers responded very well to the democratic platform. Wang Cuiying, a worker in the Third Workshop, said: "This time, we have said everything we have wanted to say for several years." Li Chunsheng, a worker in the Second Workshop, said: "In the past, we shirked responsibility and did not solve problems. Through the debate on the democratic platform, the existing problems have been clarified." After seeing the role of the democratic platform, Sun Ruiye, director of the tool workshop, took the initiative to find the heads of the First Workshop, the Second Workshop, the Inspection Section, and the Technology Section, requesting debates on the design, production, inspection, and use of molds to resolve long-standing opinions and problems among them.

The leaders of the Nanjing Electronic Tube Factory participated in the democratic platform and listened to the workers' debates. Based on the opinions raised by the workers and the specific situation of the factory, they formulated three preliminary plans for streamlining institutions, leading cadres participating in physical labor, and workers' welfare, and are also formulating improvement plans for some outstanding problems in the factory.

    南京电子管厂鸣放新形式
    设立民主讲台引导争辩
    新华社南京30日电　新华社记者蒋青萍报道：南京电子管厂在整改阶段为了继续开展大鸣大放大争，在党委领导下组织了民主讲台，有组织有领导地发动职工针对紧缩机构、干部下放，计划管理，生产准备工作，职工生活福利等具体问题展开辩论。这种形式补充了大字报形式的不足，使一些具体问题鸣放得更深更透，更有利于彻底解决。
    这个工厂在开展整风运动的五十多天以来，职工们已经贴出三千多张大字报，通过各种形式提出了九千多条意见。在整改阶段，通过民主讲台又进一步鼓舞了职工大鸣大放大争的热情。上台发言的人愈来愈多，民主讲台由两个很快就增加到四个。当一天的紧张劳动刚刚结束，职工纷纷从车间×科室走到设在草坪的民主讲台。他们有的拿着发言稿，有的从车间带来了许多实物，准备在民主讲台上对许多重要问题发表意见、开展辩论。
    职工们在整风中很关心生产的发展。因此，民主讲台第二台对“第三车间为什么不能全面地完成计划”的辩论最为热烈。第三车间是装配车间，工厂的生产任务完成的很坏，他们起着决定性作用；而各车间制造的零件的好坏，零件供应及时不及时又直接影响第三车间计划的完成。工人们在民主讲台上的辩论中，为了要弄清第三车间不能全面完成计划的责任，都以主人翁的态度，从搞好生产出发，充分作了准备。
    第三车间的工人为了进一步揭开生产中存在的问题和困难，许多人牺牲星期天和休息时间准备发言稿，有的召开小组会研究发言论点。在10月13日举行民主讲台辩论前几小时，老师傅马国栋和荣金立还从废品仓库和车间里找来各种类型的废品电子管，在民主讲台旁布置了一个小型废品展览会，分别用文字说明产生废品的原因和责任者。
    第二车间的工人也分别召开了许多小组会慎重地研究分析第三车间对他们提出的批评。和第三车间关系最密切，也是第三车间意见最多的芯柱工段，对第三车间提出的一些正确意见，立即采取改进措施；对一些不能同意的意见，也搜集了资料来进行辩论。
    工人们在民主讲台上一面针锋相对地开展辩论，一面互相进行访问。第三车间老师傅马国栋在玻璃加工方面有十多年的经验。在辩论过程中，他到第二车间芯柱工段了解操作情况。第二车间芯柱工段李春生、胡国庆也分别到第三车间观看工人的操作，研究产生废品原因。这样就促进了问题的迅速解决。
    在另一些民主讲台上，对机构如何精简，人员怎样下放等问题，也都进行了辩论。
    工人们对民主讲台反映很好。第三车间工人王翠英说：“这次把我们几年来要说的话都说出来了。”第二车间工人李春生说：“过去互相推诿，不解决问题，通过民主讲台的辩论，存在的问题就明确了。”工具车间主任孙瑞叶看到了民主讲台的作用以后，主动地找第一车间、第二车间、检验科、技术科等部门的负责人，要求对模具的设计、生产、检验和使用等问题开展辩论，解决互相间长期存在的意见和问题。
    南京电子管厂领导人员都参加民主讲台，倾听职工的辩论。他们根据职工提出的意见和厂内的具体情况，制订了紧缩机构、领导干部参加体力劳动和职工生活福利等三个初步方案，对厂内一些突出的问题也在分别制订改进方案。
