Persist in the Struggle to Demand Disarmament
A commentator for this newspaper

The discussion on the disarmament issue at the current United Nations General Assembly has concluded. Under the manipulation of the United States and its partners, the General Assembly has successively adopted the so-called "disarmament" proposal of twenty-four countries and the six-nation proposal to unilaterally expand the Disarmament Committee. However, these two proposals not only do not promote the resolution of the disarmament issue in the slightest, but on the contrary, are conducive to the Western countries continuing to delay and undermine disarmament negotiations, thereby hindering the resolution of the disarmament issue.

The situation of the UN General Assembly's discussion on the disarmament issue once again shows that there are two fundamentally different positions on this issue. On the one hand, the Soviet Union is actively promoting the resolution of the disarmament issue and has made tremendous efforts for this purpose; on the other hand, the United States and its partners do not want disarmament at all and are attempting to continue to use disarmament negotiations as a guise for their arms expansion.

In order for all countries to take concrete measures in disarmament as soon as possible, the Soviet Union has submitted to the UN General Assembly proposals for initial disarmament measures. This proposal includes: immediate cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons; countries agreeing to undertake the obligation to renounce the use of the above-mentioned weapons; substantial reduction of armed forces, armaments, and military expenditures; starting to remove military bases established in other countries; and establishing corresponding international supervision for the implementation of these measures. Obviously, the Soviet Union's proposal is practical and feasible. If the various measures stipulated in the Soviet Union's proposal are implemented, it will open the way for a thorough solution to the disarmament issue.

Not only that, the Soviet Union also actively demanded a change in the method of disarmament negotiations to promote the resolution of the disarmament issue. To this end, the Soviet Union proposed the establishment of a permanent disarmament committee composed of all member states of the United Nations to replace the previous United Nations Disarmament Committee and its subcommittees, which were composed of a small number of countries. Past facts have proved that the negotiations conducted in the previous United Nations Disarmament Committee and its subcommittees have been fruitless for many years because the Western countries, which made up the majority of its members, used all kinds of methods in the negotiations to obstruct and create deadlocks. In fact, this kind of negotiation was just a means for Western countries to deal with public opinion. Under these circumstances, it is absolutely necessary and appropriate for the Soviet Union to announce its withdrawal from the United Nations Disarmament Committee and its subcommittees and to demand that a permanent committee composed of all member states of the United Nations take on the responsibility of disarmament negotiations. Putting disarmament negotiations under the joint supervision of large and small countries and the people of all countries may break the Western countries' malicious attempt to use disarmament negotiations to cover up their arms expansion and force them to change their attitude and conduct serious negotiations.

However, the United States and its partners at the United Nations General Assembly not only rejected the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals, but also rejected India's proposal to immediately stop nuclear weapons testing. From this, it can be seen that they refuse to do anything in terms of disarmament measures. As for the twenty-four-nation proposal passed under the manipulation of the United States and its partners, it is not a proposal to solve the disarmament issue, but a proposal to hinder the solution of the disarmament issue. This proposal does not mention the issue of prohibiting the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons at all, and its purpose is obviously to legalize the use of such weapons of mass destruction of humanity. At the same time, the six points of complete disarmament measures stipulated in this proposal are mutually involved, and the implementation of each point must be premised on the prior agreement of the other points. Therefore, this is a linked set that is not actually prepared to solve any problems, so as to keep the disarmament negotiations in a deadlock.

On the issue of the composition of the Disarmament Committee, the United States and its partners also rejected the relevant proposals of the Soviet Union and Albania to expand the Disarmament Committee to thirty-two countries. They manipulated the General Assembly to pass the six-nation proposal to unilaterally increase the members of this committee to twenty-five countries. However, according to the members of the Disarmament Committee increased by the six-nation proposal, the majority are participating countries of the military blocs under the manipulation of the United States. Therefore, the United States and its partners can still manipulate this committee, using it as a tool to hinder disarmament negotiations and a guise to cover up their arms expansion.

Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union's statement that it will not participate in the work of this so-called expanded Disarmament Committee is a blow to the United States and its partners' attempt to continue to use disarmament negotiations to carry out arms expansion.

Facts have proved that what the United States and its partners are enthusiastic about is not disarmament, but arms expansion and war preparations. In two consecutive speeches delivered on the 11th and 13th of this month, U.S. President Eisenhower openly put forward an action program for accelerating arms expansion and asked the American people to tighten their belts for this purpose. The slogan of the US ruling class is "Less butter, more cannons." At the same time, the United States and Britain, together, are preparing to force other member states of the North Atlantic Group to accept their plan to accelerate arms expansion and war preparations at the top-level meeting of the North Atlantic Group to be held next month, in order to strengthen this military group. This practice of the United States and its partners fully exposes the hypocritical mask on the disarmament issue. The people of all countries will no longer believe their hypocritical rhetoric.

The people of all countries urgently hope to achieve disarmament, especially to reach an agreement on stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons and prohibiting the use of such weapons as soon as possible, in order to promote world peace. The United States and its partners' frantic actions to expand arms and prepare for war are a challenge to this good wish of the people of all countries. The people of all countries must act vigorously to oppose the arms expansion and war preparation policies of the United States and its partners and persist in the struggle to demand disarmament.

    坚持要求实现裁军的斗争
    本报评论员
    本届联合国大会关于裁军问题的讨论已经结束了。在美国及其伙伴的操纵下，大会曾先后通过了二十四国的所谓“裁军”提案和片面扩大裁军委员会的六国提案。但是，这两个提案不但丝毫不能促进裁军问题的解决，相反的却有利于西方国家继续拖延和破坏裁军谈判，从而阻挠裁军问题的解决。
    联大对裁军问题讨论的情况再一次表明，在这个问题上有着两种根本不同的立场。一方面是苏联积极地促进裁军问题的解决，并为此作了巨大的努力；另一方面是美国及其伙伴根本不想裁军，并企图继续利用裁军谈判作为它们扩充军备的幌子。
    为了各国在裁军方面能够迅速采取具体措施，苏联曾向联大提出了初步裁军措施的建议。这个建议包括：立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器；各国相约承担拒绝使用上述武器的义务；大量裁减武装部队、军备和军费；着手撤除设在别国境内的军事基地；建立实行这些措施的相应的国际监督。显然，苏联的建议是切实可行的，如果实施苏联建议所规定的各项措施，就将为彻底解决裁军问题打开道路。
    不仅如此，苏联还积极要求改变裁军谈判的方式，以推动裁军问题的解决。为此，苏联曾建议成立由联合国所有成员国组成的常设裁军委员会，以代替以前由少数国家组成的联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会。过去的事实证明，在以前的联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会中所进行的谈判，由于其中成员西方国家占多数，并且它们在谈判中使尽各种方法进行阻挠和制造僵局，以至谈判多年而一事无成。这种谈判事实上只是西方国家应付舆论的一种手段罢了。在这种情况下，苏联宣布退出联合国的裁军委员会及其小组委员会，而要求以联合国所有成员国组成的常设委员会来负担起裁军谈判的责任，是十分必要的和适宜的。把裁军谈判置于大小国家和各国人民的共同监督下，就可能打破西方国家利用裁军谈判来掩饰它们扩充军备的不良图谋，并迫使它们改变态度来认真地进行谈判。
    但是，美国及其伙伴在联合国大会上，不仅拒绝了苏联的裁军建议，而且也拒绝了印度所提出的要求立即停止核武器试验的建议。由此可见，它们拒绝在裁军措施方面做任何一件事情。至于在美国及其伙伴的操纵下所通过的二十四国提案，它不是解决裁军问题的提案，而是阻碍解决裁军问题的提案。这个提案根本没有提到禁止使用原子武器和氢武器的问题，其目的显然是要把使用这种大规模毁灭人类的武器合法化。同时在这个提案中所规定的六点全部裁军措施，又是互相牵连的，要实行每一点，都必须以其他各点为达成协议的先决条件。因此，这是一个实际上不准备解决任何问题的连环套，以便使裁军问题的谈判继续陷于僵局。
    在裁军委员会的组成问题上，美国及其伙伴也拒绝了苏联的有关建议以及阿尔巴尼亚把裁军委员会扩大到三十二个国家的建议。它们操纵大会通过了片面地把这个委员会的成员增加到二十五个国家的六国提案。但是根据六国提案所增加的裁军委员会的成员，大多数都是美国操纵下的军事集团的参加国。因此，美国及其伙伴依然可以操纵这个委员会，把这个委员会作为它们阻挠裁军谈判的工具和掩饰它们扩充军备的幌子。
    在这种情况下，苏联声明它将不参加这个所谓扩大了的裁军委员会的工作，这是对美国及其伙伴企图继续利用裁军谈判来进行扩充军备的图谋的一个打击。
    事实证明，美国及其伙伴所热中的不是裁减军备，而是扩军备战。美国总统艾森豪威尔在本月11日和13日连续发表的两次演说中，就公然地提出了加速进行扩充军备的行动纲领，并且要求美国人民为此勒紧腰带。美国统治集团的口号是“少些牛油，多些大炮”。同时，美国和英国一道，还准备在下月即将举行的北大西洋集团的最高级会议上，迫使这个集团的其他成员国家接受它们加速扩军备战的方案，以加强这个军事集团。美国及其伙伴的这种做法，完全暴露了它们在裁军问题上的装模作样的假面目。各国人民是不会再相信它们的伪善言论了。
    各国人民迫切地希望实现裁军，特别是能早日达成停止试验原子武器和氢武器和禁止使用这种武器的协议，以促进世界和平。美国及其伙伴疯狂地进行扩军备战的行动，是向各国人民的这种善良愿望的挑战。各国人民必须紧张地行动起来，反对美国及其伙伴的扩军备战政策，坚持要求实现裁军的斗争。
