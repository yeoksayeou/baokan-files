Xinhua News Agency, Kuala Lumpur, November 20th: Authorities in the Federation of Malaya have been employing violent and dictatorial methods in various cities in recent days to suppress Chinese secondary school students demanding revisions to education policies and protesting government atrocities.

In Penang, northern Malaya, Police Chief O’Flynn announced today that police on the island had arrested twenty-three students before dawn. He said that the government fully agrees with and encourages this kind of police action.

The Federation of Malaya's Minister of Education, Mohammed Khir Johari, personally went to Penang on November 18th to order the expulsion of twenty-four students from three different secondary schools. Police there had used tear gas to attack assembled students on November 14th, injuring many, and subsequently closed three schools.

In Seremban, the capital of Negeri Sembilan, government authorities also arrested two male and two female students this morning. On November 19th, the government had already closed a school in Seremban and arrested nine young students.

In Ipoh, the capital of Perak state, a team of police officers, carrying rattan canes, broke into St. Mary's Girls' School, run by the Catholic Church, on November 19th, dispersing a protest rally held by students, and arresting a female teacher and four students. In this city, government authorities have twice used violence to disperse students demanding classes and holding demonstrations, arresting nine students and confiscating a large number of student bicycles.

In Malacca, two students from Pay Fong High School were also ordered to be expelled by the authorities.

In Kuala Lumpur, the capital of the Federation of Malaya, authorities have also used police force to threaten assembled students.

Students throughout Malaya are holding rallies and demonstrations to protest the government's policies aimed at ultimately eliminating Chinese education, oppose the government's unreasonable ban on so-called "over-aged" students from attending school, and protest the government's use of violent suppression, arrests, expulsions, and other measures that violate human rights. The students' legitimate demands have gained the sympathy of public opinion.

    马来亚学生反对教育政策
    联合邦当局实行暴力镇压
    据新华社20日讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚联合邦当局连日来各城市采取了暴力和专横手段来镇压要求政府修改教育政策和抗议政府暴行的华文中学学生。
    在马来亚北部的槟榔屿，警察长官欧弗林今天宣布，在这个岛上的警察已经在黎明前搜捕了二十三个学生。他说，政府完全同意和鼓励这种警察行动。
  马来亚联合邦教育部长穆罕默德·希尔18日曾经亲自到槟榔屿下令开除分属于三所中学的二十四名学生。那里的警察曾经在14日使用催泪弹来袭击集会学生以致有不少学生受了伤，事后还有三所学校被停闭。
    在森美兰首府芙蓉，政府当局今天早上也逮捕了两个男学生和两个女学生。而在19日，政府在芙蓉已经停闭了一所学校和逮捕了九个青年学生。
    在霹雳州首府怡保，一队警察19日携带藤鞭闯进天主教会办的圣玛丽亚女校，解散学生们举行的抗议集会，逮捕了一名女教师和四名学生。在这个城市，政府当局已经先后两次用暴力驱散了要求上课和举行示威游行的学生，逮捕了九名学生，抢夺了大批学生的自行车。
    在马六甲，也有培风学校的两名学生被当局下令开除。
    在马来亚联合邦首府吉隆坡，当局也曾使用警察力量来威胁集会的学生。
    马来亚各地学生举行集会示威，是为了抗议政府采取目的在于最终消灭华文教育的政策，反对政府无理禁止所谓“超龄”学生就学，抗议政府对学生采取暴力镇压、逮捕和开除等侵犯人权的措施。学生们的正当要求获得了舆论的同情。
