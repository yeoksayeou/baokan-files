    A Country Where Planes Never Fall	Chi Bei'ou (池北偶)
    A British gentleman once boasted of an empire "on which the sun never sets" and was arrogant,
    But now what never falls above their heads are American planes.
    The planes are also carrying hydrogen bombs that are prone to explosion,
    This is more dangerous than the sword of Damocles hanging overhead by far!
    But the Foreign Secretary thinks he can take it lightly,
    He said calmly: "That is a matter for the US Strategic Air Command."
    As if the British Isles have long become the forty-ninth state of America,
    And Mr. Lloyd is just a small servant of Washington.
    If this is the so-called "mutual dependence" of the Anglo-American alliance,
    Then, we can only admit that it is indeed rare and strange!

    永无落机之国	池北偶
    英国绅士曾经自炫“永无落日”而不可一世，
    如今在他们头顶永不下落的是美国飞机。
    飞机上还载有容易爆炸的氢弹，
    这比达摩克利斯头上的悬剑危险何止千万？
    但外交大臣却认为可以等闲视之，
    他安详地说：“那是美国战略空军司令部的事。”
    仿佛英伦三岛早已成为美利坚的第四十九州，
    劳埃德先生不过是华盛顿的一个小仆欧。
    如果这就是所谓美英盟邦的“互相依赖”，
    那末，我们只好承认确是少见多怪！
