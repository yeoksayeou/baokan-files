Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th: A winter planting production upsurge has initially formed in Guangdong Province. Millions of farmers are simultaneously harvesting rice, plowing land, and carrying out crash winter planting. According to statistics, on the more than ten million mu of rice paddies where late rice has been harvested throughout the province, six million mu have already been planted with winter crops such as sweet potatoes, wheat, and beans. Compared with the same period last year, the progress of winter planting this year is much faster. The fertilizer accumulation work in the province has also made significant progress, with nearly 400 million dan of fertilizer now accumulated, averaging 19 dan of fertilizer that can be applied per mu.

The characteristics of this year's winter planting in Guangdong are: farmers are motivated, act early, and the quality of winter planting is relatively good. In Zhanjiang Prefecture, sweet potatoes were generally planted after "Beginning of Winter" in the past, but this year many farmers planted sweet potatoes half a month earlier. Farmers in Foshan, Hepu Prefectures, and Hainan Administrative Region have changed the past extensive cultivation methods for winter planting, and are now generally practicing fine land preparation and uniform sowing. Through discussions on the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Party and the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, the confidence of rural cadres and farmers throughout the province in completing the winter planting tasks has been enhanced. In the past ten days or so, various regions have successively held meetings of agricultural activists and cadre meetings with hundreds of thousands of participants in total. At the same time, various places have universally mobilized the masses of farmers to conduct extensive debates on winter production issues, thereby enabling the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives throughout the province to revise their originally low winter planting plans and overcome the various difficulties brought about by expanding the winter planting area.

According to reports from various places, the development of winter production in Guangdong Province is still uneven. In some areas, due to the failure to fully mobilize the masses to conduct extensive debates, the momentum is not strong enough and the actions are also very slow.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 18th: A winter production upsurge has begun to form in Guangxi Province. All six prefectures and many counties, districts, and townships throughout the province have re-revised their winter planting plans through socialist debates; most areas have made rapid progress in autumn harvest and winter planting; and the mass movement to build water conservancy projects has also begun to unfold.

At the enlarged meetings of the CPC prefectural and county committees or the three-level cadre meetings held successively in various places last month, right-leaning conservative thinking was seriously criticized, and favorable conditions for production were analyzed to find ways to overcome difficulties, and a general plan for the second five-year plan and next year's production plan was formulated.

The fifteen directly subordinate counties, including Yongning and Wuming in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, originally planned for a total of 2 million mu of winter planting, which was increased to 2.58 million mu after extensive debates. The Guilin Prefectural Committee proposed "striving to double the grain output in the entire region within five years," and determined that by 1962, the grain output per mu of paddy fields should reach 650, 750, and 850 jin respectively, and the output per mu of dryland crops should reach 400, 500, and 600 jin respectively.

The autumn harvest and winter planting work in various places has now entered a busy stage. The province has harvested 7 million mu of mid-season rice and late rice, and planted more than 3 million mu of various winter crops. The winter planting progress in Rong County and Baise Prefecture is faster than last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th: Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, has launched a winter production upsurge, striving to increase the grain yield per unit area next year by 35% compared to this year, and to achieve the highest target of 800 jin stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule.

Yangzhong County, surrounded by rivers and with low-lying terrain, has vigorously built farmland water conservancy projects in recent years, reducing waterlogging disasters and changing the historically low-yield situation of no more than 350 jin per mu on average. The grain yield per unit area in the county this year reached more than 580 jin, an increase of 24% compared to the bumper year of 1952, and it has jumped from a grain-deficient county to a grain-surplus county. Now, all 180-plus agricultural cooperatives in the county have completed the autumn planting task 20 days ahead of schedule, and immediately switched to checking seedlings and replanting, checking and eliminating wasteland, and launching farmland water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation movements.

The CPC Yangzhong County Committee has also recently stipulated that each county committee member should spend 50% of the year participating in labor in agricultural cooperatives, helping to study and solve various problems, and learning to use new working methods to lead production.

    分析有利条件　批判保守思想
    广东广西冬季生产形成高潮
    扬中县争取明年粮食产量达到纲要规定指标
    据新华社广州19日电　广东省冬种生产高潮已经初步形成。千百万农民正在一边割稻，一边翻地，一边突击冬种。据统计，全省目前收完晚稻的一千多万亩稻田里，已有六百万亩稻田种了番薯、小麦、豆类等冬季作物。与去年同期比较，今年冬种进度快了很多。全省积肥工作也有显著进展，现在已积集肥料将近四亿担，平均每亩可施十九担肥料。
    今年广东冬种的特点是：农民劲头足，行动早，冬种质量比较好。湛江专区去年一般到“立冬”后才种植番薯，今年有不少农民提前半个月种了番薯。佛山、合浦专区和海南行政区的农民，改变了过去冬种粗放的耕作方法，普遍实行精细整地，均匀播种。经过对党的三中全会决议和全国农业发展纲要修正草案的讨论，提高了全省农村干部和农民完成冬种任务的信心。最近十几天里，各地区相继举行过共有数十万人参加的农业积极分子会议和干部会议，与此同时各地又普遍发动农民群众就冬季生产问题进行了大辩论，从而使全省绝大部分农业社修订了原来偏低的冬种规划，并克服了由于扩大冬种面积带来的种种困难。
    据各地反映，广东省冬种生产现在发展得仍不平衡，有一部分地区由于没有充分发动群众进行大辩论，劲头不够大，行动也很迟缓。
    据新华社南宁18日电　广西省冬季生产高潮已经开始形成。全省六个专区和许多县、区、乡通过社会主义大辩论，都重新修订了冬种计划；大部分地区秋收冬种进展速度很快；群众的兴修水利运动，也初步开展起来。
    各地在上月份相继召开的中共地、县委扩大会议或三级干部会议上，都严肃地批判了右倾保守思想，并分析了生产的有利条件，找出克服困难的办法，制定出第二个五年计划的大体规划和明年的生产计划。
    桂西僮族自治州邕宁、武鸣等十五个直属县，原订冬种计划共二百万亩，经过大辩论增加到二百五十八万亩。桂林地委提出“争取五年内全区粮食产量提高一倍”，并确定到1962年每亩水田粮食产量分别达到六百五十、七百五十和八百五十斤，每亩旱地作物产量分别达到四百、五百和六百斤。
    各地的秋收和冬种工作现在已进入大忙阶段。全省已收割中稻、晚稻七百万亩，种下各种冬季作物三百多万亩。容县、百色专区的冬种进度都比去年快。
    据新华社南京19日电　江苏省扬中县掀起冬季生产热潮，争取明年粮食单位面积产量比今年增加三成半，提前达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的最高指标八百斤。
    四周环江、地势低洼的扬中县，近几年来，大力兴修农田水利，减少了内涝灾害，改变了历史上平均每亩产量不超过三百五十斤的低产状况。全县今年粮食单位面积产量达五百八十多斤，比丰收的1952年增加24％，由缺粮县一跃而为余粮县。现在全县一百八十多个农业社提前二十天完成秋种任务后，立即转入查苗补种、查荒灭荒和开展兴修农田水利、积肥运动。
    中共扬中县委最近还规定每个县委委员全年要有50％的时间到农业社参加劳动，帮助研究和解决各项问题，学会用新的工作方法来领导生产。
