Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou -- The Li and Miao peoples of Hainan have changed their habit of "seeking gods and worshiping ghosts" when they are sick, and have generally begun to pay attention to hygiene and believe in medical treatment.

Before liberation, this area with a population of more than 600,000 had basically no medical institutions. The masses could not resist diseases, and the concept of believing in ghosts and gods was strong. Those suffering from minor illnesses would kill dogs or use fish, eggs, and other things to pray to the gods, and those with serious illnesses would kill cattle and pigs to pray to the gods.

The person in charge of the Health Department of the Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture said: In the early days of liberation, the masses believed that illness was the "arrival of demons" and were not interested in free medical care. They would close their doors when they saw health workers. Only after years of vigorously establishing health and medical institutions and carrying out a series of publicity and education work did the masses gradually change their superstitious ideas. With the significant improvement of people's lives, medical institutions are now collecting medical fees. At present, the prefecture has established a total of 68 hospitals, epidemic prevention stations, health centers, maternal and child health centers, and malaria prevention stations, which safeguard the health of the people.

Since the widespread development of maternal and child health care work, the feudal malpractice of not allowing pregnant women to give birth at home has also been changed. In the past, the very high mortality rates of mothers and infants have been greatly reduced. Now, in the seven counties of the prefecture, new-style midwifery stations have been established in basically every township, and a large number of new-style midwives have been trained in rural areas. It is also increasingly common for women to receive new-style midwifery and prenatal check-ups. In addition, the majority of women have also developed the habit of using menstrual belts and bathing and changing clothes after labor.

The number of malaria patients and children suffering from various respiratory infections here has decreased significantly in the past two years. The main reason is that mosquito nets are more common, and children have enough clothes to wear.

    海南黎、苗族人民破除迷信讲究卫生
    新华社广州电　海南黎族、苗族人民改变有病“求神祀鬼”的习惯，普遍开始讲究卫生、相信医疗。
    这个拥有六十多万人口的地区，解放以前基本上没有医疗机构。群众对疾病无法抗拒，迷信鬼神的观念强烈。患轻病的，杀狗或用鱼、鸡蛋等东西求神，病情严重的就杀牛、杀猪求神。
    黎族苗族自治州卫生部门的负责人说：解放初期，群众因为迷信生病是“魔鬼降临”，对免费医疗也不感兴趣，见到卫生人员就关起门来，连年来各地大力建立卫生医疗机构，和经过一系列的宣传教育工作后，才逐步改变了群众的迷信观念。随着人民生活的显著改善，现在各医疗机构要收回医疗费了。目前，全州已设立的医院、防疫站、卫生所、妇幼保健站、疟疾防治站共有六十八所，维护了广大人民的健康。
    妇幼保健工作广泛开展以后，不准孕妇在家里生小孩的封建恶习也改变过来了。过去，很高的产妇和婴儿无辜死亡率已大大降低。现在，全州七个县里，基本上每个乡都建立了新法接生站，在农村中培养了大批新法接生员，妇女接受新法接生和产前检查的也越来越普遍。此外，广大妇女还养成了使用月经带，和劳动后沐浴换洗衣服的习惯。
    这里的疟疾患者和小孩患各种呼吸道感染病的近两年来已显著减少。主要原因是比较普遍的有了蚊帐，小孩有足够衣服穿。
