    He Fell in Love with the Greenhouse
    – Downward Transferred Cadre Zhang Guozhong at the Vegetable Production Cooperative
    By Our Reporter Yi Qin
    On October 14th, Zhang Guozhong, a cadre from the Haidian District Agricultural and Forestry Department in the suburbs of Beijing, who had been transferred downwards, arrived at the Sijiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative and was assigned to the greenhouse team.
  “I'm going to go from refined to rough!”
    On the third day after arriving at the team, it happened to be the day when the team was loading manure compost. Hundreds of thousands of pounds of manure compost needed to be distributed to each team urgently. This work was both smelly and tiring; but Zhang Guozhong was not intimidated by the "dirty" and "tiring" aspects. He worked with everyone else, diligently loading manure compost. When he started loading, some mischievous team members coldly said, "Zhang Guozhong, this is the kind of work our 'rough guys' do. You cultured people should stand aside and keep count." Zhang Guozhong thought: This is the moment when the farmers are testing me, and also when I am testing myself! I can't bow my head in the face of difficulties. He then replied, "Alright, I came down here to work, to become 'refined to rough', so that I can do both rough and refined work." As he spoke, he worked even harder. After working for a few hours, he felt very tired, and his nose and mouth felt dry. He unconsciously touched his nostrils and lips with his hand, smearing yellow manure on his nose and mouth. He thought: They only said that moving manure was dirty, but no one expected it to be this dirty. His heart wavered, and he wanted to retreat, but when he looked at the farmers, some were sweating profusely but still loading vigorously, while others wiped their faces and continued working as if nothing had happened. He thought: The farmers are working so hard, why can't I? Didn't I come here for training? What kind of training is this? Thinking about this, his energy returned. That afternoon, he barely rested and loaded nearly ten thousand pounds of manure compost, just like the farmers. At night, his shoulders and legs ached, but he recovered from his fatigue the next day.
    Everywhere is a Teacher, There are No Insurmountable Difficulties
    According to the decision of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, the Sijiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative was to pilot "unheated greenhouses". Greenhouses usually burn coal. In unheated greenhouses, no coal is burned, but instead, solar energy is fully utilized to allow vegetables to grow. This method had been widely used in vegetable greenhouses in Northeast China. However, in Beijing, it was still the first experiment. If the experiment is successful and widely promoted, each four-room greenhouse can save more than two tons of coal each winter. There are a total of more than seven thousand greenhouses in the suburbs of Beijing, which can save a total of more than three thousand five hundred tons of coal. When the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry decided to conduct the experiment here, the greenhouse team was not very willing to accept the task. They believed that experiments were different from production. For production, as long as the crops grow well and the harvest is good, that's enough; for experiments, you have to explain the rationale, so you have to study at any time. For example, the simplest temperature measurement! You have to measure it six times a day, and there must be different observations for different parts that receive sunlight. Isn't this too troublesome? Some people also lacked confidence in this experiment. They said: For decades, greenhouses have been heated by fire. If you don't burn a fire, how can it be a greenhouse? If it's not a greenhouse, how can vegetables grow in winter? Due to the above concerns, everyone was not very willing to accept this experiment. After Zhang Guozhong was transferred to the greenhouse team, the greenhouse team committee decided to give him this task, with Ren Huanying, the team's technician, responsible for guidance. When Zhang Guozhong initially accepted this task, he also had ideological concerns: Greenhouse work is technically demanding, and many operations in the greenhouse involve detailed and complex techniques, not to mention that this is a new job? Can I handle it? At this time, he remembered the mobilization report of the district head: to train in arduous labor, to humbly learn from the farmers. He thought, nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it. As long as I study hard and rely closely on the masses, the difficulties will naturally be solved.
    On top of the glass windows of each greenhouse, there is a thick layer of reed mats. The "unheated greenhouse" has a total of thirteen reed mats, each weighing more than one hundred pounds. These thirteen reed mats must be rolled up by Zhang Guozhong alone every morning before sunrise and put down every evening before sunset. Otherwise, solar heat cannot be fully utilized. This is naturally another arduous physical labor for Zhang Guozhong, who has never done farm work. Therefore, in the first few days, he always couldn't do it well. At dawn in early winter in the north, the climate is often around zero degrees. When Zhang Guozhong puts on his thick cotton coat and climbs onto the greenhouse, the cold wind is truly howling, making him shiver in his heart, but before he finishes rolling up two reed mats, he is already sweating profusely. Despite using so much effort, the reed mats are still rolled up crookedly, and it is not easy to put them down properly at night. They either don't cover completely, don't cover tightly, or overlap. He thought: There must be a trick to this. He asked the cooperative director, Li Molin, for advice. Li Molin told him that rolling and putting down reed mats not only requires effort, but also requires just the right amount of effort, and told him how to use his strength. Zhang Guozhong did it this way, and it worked. Now, he can handle those thirteen reed mats with ease. Every day, he always puts them down on time and rolls them up on time, which plays a significant role in maintaining solar heat in the room.
    In addition to a certain amount of sunlight and temperature, vegetables also need water to grow. However, in unheated greenhouses, if you water in the very cold winter, there is no fire in the greenhouse, which will inevitably affect the underground temperature, and may even freeze, which will seriously affect vegetable growth. After research by the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, it was decided to water thoroughly now. So, Zhang Guozhong watered the unheated greenhouse with an extra-large amount of water, three inches deep, estimated to have penetrated more than three feet deep into the ground, so that less watering would be needed throughout the winter. For the sake of the future, watering thoroughly at once is of course the right thing to do, but it was not estimated that too much temporary moisture at the beginning would also affect vegetable growth. For example, on the third day after watering, cucumber seeds should have been planted, but there was too much moisture on the ground, and the cucumber seeds could not be planted. What to do? If you wait a few more days, it will affect the timely planting of cucumbers. If you don't plant them in time, it will affect the timely supply of the city's people's needs. If you plant them like this! The ground is full of mud, how can you plant them? In this case, he knew that he had to break the surface of the soil with a four-pronged fork to allow the moisture to evaporate easily. So he squatted on the vegetable ridges in the greenhouse all day long, gently scratching the surface of the soil with a four-pronged fork. Operating in a greenhouse is not the same as working outside. Sometimes you have to bend over, sometimes you have to squat, and sometimes you have to crawl. Therefore, although breaking the surface of the soil is not a heavy physical labor, the special operating conditions of the greenhouse exhausted Zhang Guozhong so much that his back ached on the first day. Two days later, the moisture on the ground slowly evaporated, and he quickly sowed the cucumber seeds.
    The cucumber seeds sprouted, but the seedlings were not strong. Zhang Guozhong became anxious again. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? He asked Xia Guangyao, the leader of the sixth group of the greenhouse team, and others to come and see what the reason was. Xia Guangyao told him that it was still because there was too much moisture, and the seedlings had a "leggy" phenomenon. The only way to solve this was to dry the ditches. So Zhang Guozhong used a small agricultural tool with one or two prongs to gently turn over the soil in the ditches, pile it up, turn it over again, and pile it up again. Let the soil below come up, and the soil above go down. The soil below sees the sunlight and dries easily. After a few days, the seedlings stopped growing lanky and became strong. To date, the seedlings in the unheated greenhouse have been growing very well. The reporter saw with his own eyes that the cucumber seedlings planted by Zhang Guozhong for the first time have blossomed and fruited just like the cucumber seedlings in other greenhouses. The big cucumbers are already three inches long. The confidence of the team members has increased. Two or three at a time ran over to take a look and said: Old Zhang is doing a really good job. We can do it next year too.
    Protecting the Seedlings Like Protecting Your Own Eyes
    Zhang Guozhong not only humbly studies technology, but also "loves the cooperative like his own home." Originally, his home was in Xishan Township, very close to the greenhouse team. He could have comfortably lived in his own home, but in order to measure the temperature at ten o'clock every night, he decided to move into the seedling raising room next to the team office. In this way, every morning after getting out of bed and washing his face, it would only take him a minute to walk to the greenhouse. Once he got to the greenhouse, he would first roll up the reed mats, test the temperature, and then check whether the seedlings were growing well. Every seedling could not escape his gaze every morning. On the morning of the 9th, when he looked at them one by one, he found that one seedling had fallen down. He almost broke out in a cold sweat. He quickly climbed onto the vegetable ridge and took a closer look. It turned out that a small clod of soil was pressing on the roots of the seedling. So, like treating the scar of his own child, he carefully and gently moved the clod of soil away, then straightened the seedling, and carefully and gently pressed the roots with his hand. A few days later, the seedling grew safely.
    Now, the weather is getting colder, and unheated greenhouses need more careful care. At night, Zhang Guozhong sleeps in the seedling raising room. Whenever he hears the north wind howling, he feels uneasy. He is afraid that the reed mats will be blown over by the wind and freeze his seedlings. In order to solve this problem, he has simply moved from the seedling raising room to live in the greenhouse. In this way, he can be with the seedlings day and night.
    Zhang Guozhong's love for the seedlings can also be proven by the conversations I had with two greenhouse team members. One day, I went to find Zhang Guozhong. I called out outside the greenhouse, but there was no response from inside. I randomly found a team member and asked him. He said: Zhang Guozhong! I guarantee he won't go there. He's been here for more than a month, and except for eating and sleeping (at that time he hadn't moved into the greenhouse to live), he spends all day squatting next to his seedlings, touching this, fiddling with that, just afraid that a seedling is missing or injured. Another person chimed in: He can't hear people calling him, he must be engrossed in fiddling with the seedlings again. I listened to their words and went inside. Sure enough, Zhang Guozhong was concentrating on erecting cucumber racks!
    Zhang Guozhong said: To train in labor, you must settle down and work earnestly. Only by working earnestly can you obtain the qualifications of the working people, and you will have a future no matter what you do. He also believes that agricultural production technology is extremely complex. To develop agriculture, you can only improve technology. He will more actively study technology and dedicate his life to agriculture, so as not to disappoint the expectations of the organization. (Attached photo)

    他爱上了温室
    ——下放干部张国忠在蔬菜生产合作社
    本报记者  宜勤
    10月14日，京郊海淀区农林科下放干部张国忠来到了四季青蔬菜生产合作社，并被分配在温室队。
  “我也要由细变粗啦”
    到队里的第三天，正逢队里装粪面，几十万斤粪面，急需分配到各队去。干这个活儿又臭又累；但是张国忠，并没有被“脏”、“累”吓倒。他跟大伙儿在一起，一个劲儿地装着粪面。开始装时，个别调皮的社员曾冷冷地说：“张国忠，这是咱们老大粗干的活儿，你们有文化的人站在一边记记数儿吧。”张国忠心想：这就是农民在考验自己、也是自己考验自己的时候呀！在困难面前，怎么也不能低头。他就接口说：“行，下来就是来干的，要干得我由细变粗，粗细都能干才行。”他说着，手里也就干得更加起劲了。干了几个钟头以后，他怪累的，又觉得鼻干口燥，想喝水，不自觉地用手在鼻孔里和嘴唇上摸了一下，就把黄黄的粪沫抹在鼻和嘴上了。他想：只说弄粪脏，谁也没有料到脏成这样子，他心里一翻，要打退堂鼓了，但是，看看农民，有的汗珠直流，仍在使劲装，有的抹了抹脸孔，若无其事的继续干。他心里想：农民干得那么起劲，我为什么就不能干了呢？不是说锻炼来了吗？我这算什么锻炼呢？想着想着，他的干劲又来了。这天下午，他几乎没有休息，和农民一样，装了近一万斤粪面。入夜，他肩肿腿酸，但是，第二天就恢复了疲劳。
    到处都是老师没有克服不了的困难
    四季青蔬菜生产合作社根据北京市农林局决定，要试行“不加温的温室”。温室，都烧煤。在不加温的温室里不加煤，而是充分利用太阳的热能，使蔬菜生长。在我国东北地区的蔬菜温室里，曾普遍采用这一办法。在北京，则还是第一次试验。试验成功，普遍推广，每四间温室每年冬天可以节约二吨多煤。北京市郊区总共七千多间温室，共可节约三千五百多吨煤。当农林局决定在这里进行试验的时候，温室队的人都不大愿意接受这个任务。他们认为：试验和生产不同，生产，只要庄稼长得好，收成好就行；试验，得说出个道理来，因此就要随时研究。比如最简单的计温吧！一天得计六次，而且接受太阳光不同的部位，还要有不同的观察。这不是太麻烦了吗？还有人对这项试验没有信心，他们说：几十年来，温室都是烧火的，不烧火，怎么成个温室，不成温室冬天蔬菜又怎么长？由于存在以上顾虑，大家都不大愿意接受这个试验。张国忠下放到温室队以后，温室队队委会便决定把这一任务交给他，并由队里的技术员任焕英负责指导。张国忠在开始接受这项任务的时候，也曾有思想顾虑：搞温室，技术性较强，温室里的许多操作都包括细致的、复杂的技术在里面，更何况这还是一项新的工作？自己是否能顶得下来呢？这时，他又想起区长的动员报告：要在艰苦的劳动中锻炼，要虚心向农民学习。他想，天下无难事，只怕有心人。只要自己刻苦钻研，紧紧依靠群众，困难自然会迎刃而解。
    在每一间温室的玻璃窗上面，都盖有一层厚厚的蒲席，“不加温的温室”上的蒲席一共是十三条，每条是一百多斤重。这十三条蒲席必须由张国忠一人每天在早晨日出前卷起来，晚上日落前放下。否则就不能充分利用太阳热量。这对没有干过农活的张国忠来说，自然又是一项繁重的体力劳动了。因此，他在开始几天，总是弄不好。北方初冬时的黎明，气候经常在零度左右，张国忠穿上厚厚的棉袄爬上温室的时候，真是寒风飕飕，刮得心里直打哆嗦，可是还没有卷完两条蒲席，已经是汗流浃背。尽管使了这样大的力气，蒲席还是卷得东倒西歪，晚上放的时候，也是不容易放好，不是盖不到，遮不着，就是重叠在一起。他想：这其中一定有窍门，他就请教社主任李墨林。李墨林告诉他，卷蒲席和放蒲席不仅仅要使劲，而且要使得恰到好处，并且告诉了他如何使劲的方法，张国忠照着这样办法去做，果然对头了。现在，他对那十三条蒲席，已可以应付裕如了。每天，总是按时放下，按时卷起，对保持室内太阳热能起了很大作用。
    蔬菜除了要一定的阳光、温度以外，还要靠水分才能生长，但是在不加温的温室里，如果在气候十分严寒的冬天浇水，温室里没有火，势必影响地下温度，说不定还会结冻，这就会严重地影响蔬菜生长。经农林局研究后，决定现在就一次浇足。于是，张国忠在不加温的温室浇了一次特大的水，水深三寸，估计渗透到地下三尺多深，这样，整个冬天就可以少浇水了。为以后计，一次浇足的办法当然是对的，但是，却没有估计到刚浇之初由于暂时水分过多，也会影响蔬菜生长。比如浇水后的第三天，本来应该种下黄瓜籽的，可是地面水分太多，黄瓜籽就种不下去。怎么办呢？再等几天吧！就会影响黄瓜及时下种。不能及时下种，就会影响及时供应城市人民需要。就这样种吧！地下全是泥浆，怎么种得下去？在这种情况下，他知道：必须用四齿把地皮划破，让水分容易蒸发。于是他就整天蹲在温室里的菜畦上，用四齿轻轻地划着地皮。在温室里操作，可不比在外边劳动，有的时候要弯着腰，有的时候要蹲着，还有的时候要爬伏着。因此，划破地皮虽然不是一种繁重的体力劳动，但是由于温室特殊的操作条件，第一天就把张国忠累得腰酸背疼。两天以后，地面的水分慢慢地蒸发了，就赶快把黄瓜籽播下。
    黄瓜籽出芽了，但是小苗不壮。张国忠又着急起来，这究竟算好算坏呢？他就把温室队六组组长夏光耀等人找来，让他们看看是什么道理？夏光耀告诉他还是因为水分太足，小苗有“徒长”现象。唯一的办法就是晾沟，因此张国忠又用一个两个齿的小农具轻轻地把沟里的土翻开，堆起，再翻开，再堆起。让下面的土上来，上面的土下去，下面的土见到阳光，容易干。这样几天以后，小苗不串了，变得粗壮了。到目前为止，不加温的温室里的小苗一直长得很好，记者亲眼看到：张国忠第一次栽的黄瓜苗，已和其他温室的黄瓜苗一样开花结果了，大的黄瓜已有三寸来长。队员们的信心增强了，三三两两的跑来一看，都说：老张弄得真行哩，我们明年也可以干。
    爱护小苗像爱护自己的眼珠一样
    张国忠还不仅仅虚心钻研技术，而且他“爱社如家”。本来，他的家住在西山乡，离温室队很近，他满可以舒服地住在自己家里，但是，他为了夜里十点钟还要来计温度，他决
  定搬到队办公室旁边的养苗房里住。这样，他每天早晨一下床，洗一把脸以后，只需花一分钟的时间，就走到了温室，一到温室，他先卷好蒲席，试好温度，然后就要看看小苗长得好不好？每一棵小苗在每一天早上都不能逃掉他的一眼。9日早上，当他一棵棵看过去，发现有一棵小苗倒下来的时候，他几乎急得出了一身汗，连忙爬上菜畦，走近一看，原来是一块小土块压着小苗的根部，于是他像处理自己的孩子的伤疤一样，小心地、轻轻地把土块挪开，然后把小苗扶直，又小心地、轻轻地用手压了压根部。几天以后，小苗平安生长了。
    现在，天气冷了，不加温的温室需要更加周密的照顾，夜里，张国忠睡在养苗房里，一听到朔风呼呼的时候，他就感到不安，他生怕蒲席给风吹翻了，冻坏了他的小苗。为了解决这个问题，目前，他索性由养苗房搬到温室里来住了。这样，可以朝朝夜夜和小苗在一起。
    张国忠热爱小苗的思想还可以从两个温室队的队员和我的谈话里得到证明。有一天，我去找张国忠，我在温室外面叫了一声，不见里面应声，我就随便找到一个队员问了，他说：张国忠呀！准保不会到那儿去，来了一个多月了，他除了吃饭、睡觉以外，（那时他还没有搬进温室住宿）整天蹲在他的小苗旁边，摸摸这，弄弄那，就怕那小苗缺了、伤了一棵。另一人接口说：他听不到人叫他，准又在闷着头弄小苗了。我听从他们的话走进去了，果然，张国忠正在聚精会神地竖黄瓜架呢！
    张国忠说：要在劳动中锻炼，就要安下心来，实实在在的干，只有实实在在的干，自己取得劳动人民的资格，干什么都会有前途。他还认为：农业生产技术极为复杂，要发展农业，只有提高技术，自己将更加积极钻研技术，把自己的一生献给农业，不辜负组织的期望。（附图片）
