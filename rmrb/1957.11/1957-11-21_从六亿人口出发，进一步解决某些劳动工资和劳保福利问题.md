    Today, the State Council announced four draft provisional regulations, already approved in principle by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, concerning the improvement of certain labor wages and labor insurance welfare. It also decided that various localities should designate some key factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and organs, groups, and schools to organize workers (including ordinary workers, service workers, and apprentices), and staff to widely disseminate and discuss them in conjunction with the current rectification movement. These four draft provisional regulations are: Provisional Regulations (Draft) on the Handling of Retirement for Workers and Staff; Provisional Regulations (Draft) on Wage Treatment for Ordinary Workers and Service Workers in Enterprises, Institutions, and State Organs; Provisional Regulations (Draft) on the Apprenticeship Period and Living Allowances for Apprentices in State-owned, Joint State-Private, Cooperative-run, and Individually-operated Enterprises and Institutions; Provisional Regulations (Draft) on the Vacation and Wage Treatment for Workers and Staff Returning Home to Visit Relatives. Labor wage and labor insurance welfare issues are major issues concerning the lives of the broad masses of people, and they are also major issues that reflect the socialist system of production and distribution. Submitting such major issues to the broad masses of workers and staff for discussion is a major event in China's democratic life.
    Our country's labor wage and labor insurance welfare work has made great achievements in the past eight years. In terms of labor employment, 13 million new workers and staff have been added in the past eight years. Not only have a large number of newly grown labor forces found employment, but also nearly 4 million unemployed people left over from the old society have been basically resettled. At present, the average population of general worker and staff families is about four people, and the average employed population per worker and staff family is about 1.33 people. In terms of wage work, we have fundamentally changed the semi-colonial and semi-feudal wage system and established a wage system that basically conforms to the socialist principle of distribution according to work. The wage levels of the vast majority of workers and staff have been raised. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the average wage of workers and staff nationwide was originally planned to increase by 33%, and it is expected to increase by 42.8%. In 1957, the national average annual wage of workers and staff is expected to reach 636 yuan, and the average monthly wage is expected to reach 53 yuan. Furthermore, in terms of labor insurance welfare, labor insurance and free medical care have been gradually implemented since liberation, and various collective welfare and personal welfare undertakings have been launched, improving the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of workers and staff and helping the broad masses of working people solve the hardships of birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability that could not be solved by relying on individual ability in the old society. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the supplementary wages and various welfare expenses paid by enterprises, institutions, and state organs are expected to be more than 9.6 billion yuan, equivalent to 19.2% of the total wage bill. If we add the portion of the state's expenditures on culture, education, health, and social welfare that workers and staff enjoy, it will reach more than 25% of the total wage bill. The increase in the number of employed people, the increase in wage levels, and the growth of labor insurance welfare have ensured the gradual improvement of the lives of workers and staff, and at the same time stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff and their incomparable love for the socialist system. The major achievements in our country's labor wage and labor insurance welfare work concentrate on illustrating one issue: that is, the socialist system is far superior to any old social system in history. The socialist system promotes the development of productive forces at a speed impossible in old China and capitalist countries, and on this basis, it guarantees that we can gradually solve the various problems related to improving the lives of the broad masses of people that old China could not solve. All of this is the fruit of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, and no one can deny it.
    As for the shortcomings and errors in labor wage and labor insurance welfare work, there are certainly not a few. In terms of labor employment, the employment outlets mainly faced cities, organs, enterprises, and institutions, and did not emphasize facing the countryside, and opening up social employment avenues from handicrafts, service industries, and various auxiliary labors; some people who were not suitable or necessary for employment were arranged for work, and some people who urgently needed employment were not promptly resettled. In terms of wage work, due to the inappropriate arrangements for the relationship between urban and rural areas, the relationship between new and old workers and staff, and the treatment of young intellectuals, certain wage standards and wage system regulations were not reasonable enough, resulting in the wage levels of staff in urban-rural junctions, low-level staff, apprentices, and young intellectuals being too high. In the reform of the wage system, the main shortcoming was that it was not sufficiently combined with China's actual situation, and in some issues, it ignored adapting to local conditions and excessively emphasized centralization and unification. In wage work, too much emphasis was placed on the role of material encouragement, and ideological and political work for the masses of workers and staff was relaxed, thus fostering the development of individualism, departmentalism, and egalitarianism among the masses of workers and staff. In terms of labor insurance welfare, some aspects have gone too fast, some projects have been done too much, some regulations are not reasonable enough, and there are phenomena of uneven distribution of hardship and happiness and waste.
    These shortcomings and errors in labor wage and labor insurance welfare work are undoubtedly detrimental to the country's construction cause. Our country is a country with a large population and a poor foundation. A large population and a large labor force are good things; but it is precisely because of China's large population that, although China's production has developed rapidly since liberation, the increase in means of subsistence is still relatively slow for the growing needs of 600 million people. This cannot but bring some difficulties to arranging labor employment and improving people's lives. Under these circumstances, to solve the problem of labor wages and labor insurance welfare, we must start from the population of 600 million, from the basic viewpoint of taking into account the lives of all the people in the country, especially the lives of workers and peasants, and appropriately arranging the relationship between urban and rural areas, implement a reasonable low-wage system, try to ensure that everyone has work to do, has food to eat, and on the basis of developing production, gradually improve the lives of workers and peasants. The most important reason why some shortcomings and errors have arisen in labor wage and labor insurance welfare work in the previous period is that we did not have a thorough understanding of the fundamental situation of China's large population and poor foundation, and we did not deeply understand the policy of starting from the population of 600 million, taking into account all aspects, and making appropriate arrangements. This is also the most important lesson we should learn in labor wage and labor insurance welfare work.
    Starting from a population of 600 million, and starting from the basic policy of taking into account all aspects and making appropriate arrangements, future labor employment should open up employment avenues in many ways. Although China's industry, construction industry, transportation industry, and commerce, culture, education, and health undertakings are developing rapidly, due to China's large population, the number of newly grown labor forces each year is very large, and the above-mentioned departments can only absorb a portion of the labor force; and China's agriculture can accommodate a larger amount of labor force. At present, there are 750,000 agricultural cooperatives in the country. As long as each cooperative can resettle five people, the country can resettle 3.75 million people. Therefore, for the surplus labor force in cities, they should be mainly encouraged to go to the countryside, go to the mountains, and participate in agricultural and forestry labor. China's handicrafts and service industries can also accommodate a larger labor force, and we should look for more employment avenues in these areas. In addition, we should also publicize that engaging in housework is also honorable. Housework is an indispensable part of social labor. If housewives can be diligent and thrifty in managing their households and do a good job of housework, so that their husbands and children can actively engage in various labors, it is also a contribution to the country and society. The labor remuneration their husbands and children receive also includes the price they deserve for engaging in housework.
    Starting from a population of 600 million, and starting from the basic policy of taking into account all aspects and making appropriate arrangements, the wages and welfare of workers and staff in the future must be better adapted to the actual situation of China's large population, poor foundation, and relatively low level of production. We must correctly arrange the relationship between production and life, the relationship between workers and peasants, and the relationship within the working class. We should continue to implement a reasonable low-wage system, which should not only ensure the appropriate needs of the material lives of the broad masses of workers and staff and gradually improve them on the basis of production development, but also prevent and overcome the phenomenon of a large difference between urban and rural life that is divorced from peasants. Under this premise, some unreasonable wage standards, wage systems, and labor insurance welfare systems should be adjusted and improved step by step. Only in this way can we achieve comprehensive consideration and fairness and reasonableness.
    The four draft provisional regulations announced by the State Council are concrete measures to further embody the basic policy of starting from the population of 600 million, taking into account all aspects, and making appropriate arrangements. The apprenticeship regulations are not only a major reform of China's apprenticeship system, but also will have a far-reaching impact on many aspects of China's labor wage system, and will promote the further conformity of the labor wage system to China's actual situation. This regulation corrects the serious shortcomings of the apprentices' short study time and high treatment in the past few years, which lays the foundation for expanding employment and adhering to the implementation of a reasonable low-wage system. This regulation opens up a much wider employment avenue for the vast number of young people in China, because once the apprenticeship period is extended, the number of apprentices studying in the same period will increase. And this regulation will greatly encourage handicrafts, service industries, and the vast number of individual laborers to be willing to recruit and train apprentices. Another aspect of this regulation that is beneficial to China's youth and China's construction cause is that it provides a guarantee for cultivating a new generation of the working class with good skills, good ideology, and good health in the future. The important significance of the worker and staff retirement regulations lies in the fact that they can properly resettle those who are old and physically weak and have lost their ability to work, and at the same time enable more young people to be employed. It is estimated that for every old worker and staff member who retires in the future, one to two more young apprentices can be absorbed. In this way, the interests of the country's construction cause, the elderly, and young people are taken into consideration in a comprehensive manner. In order to appropriately meet the requirements of workers and staff to return home to visit relatives, unify treatment, and control the increase in urban population, the State Council has formulated provisional regulations on workers and staff returning home to visit relatives. This regulation is also based on the spirit of taking into account all aspects. According to China's current specific conditions, appropriate arrangements have been made in the relevant relationships between the country and individuals, urban and rural areas, and within workers and staff. Ordinary workers and service workers are a combination of urban and rural laborers. At present, the wage treatment of this part of workers is too high, which is detrimental to the relationship between urban and rural areas, the relationship between workers and peasants, urban work, and agricultural production. The State Council's regulations on the wage treatment of ordinary workers and service workers appropriately solve this problem. In summary, the four draft regulations formulated in accordance with the policy of taking into account all aspects and making appropriate arrangements are completely in line with the interests of our country, workers, peasants, and the vast number of young people. It can be asserted that after these four regulations are implemented in the near future, they will surely promote the further improvement of China's labor wage system and bring many benefits to China's socialist construction cause.
    Now, the State Council's four draft regulations are about to be widely discussed by workers and staff across the country and relevant parties. We have provided the basic situation of our country's labor wage and labor insurance welfare work and discussed some basic issues in this regard as a reference for everyone's discussion. At present, enterprises, institutions, state organs, and people's organizations have launched a heated discussion on labor wage and labor insurance welfare issues in the rectification, reflecting various different understandings, some of which are correct and some of which are incorrect. We hope that through the discussion of the four draft regulations, we will further launch a debate on labor wage and labor insurance welfare issues among workers and staff across the country. All the work of our party and government has always emphasized taking the mass line. We believe in the majority of the masses, hand over a policy or a regulation to the masses for discussion. After discussion, the masses understand the situation, understand the truth, and it is easy to implement. If there are any incomplete aspects in the policy or inappropriate places in the regulations, we can absorb the opinions of the masses and revise them as soon as possible. This mass line method is also the method of socialist democracy. After this national rectification movement, the mass line method has had new developments, and new forms of socialist democracy such as great airing, great contending, great debate, and big-character posters have emerged. These forms can and should also be used to solve problems in our work. We believe that the discussion of the State Council's four draft regulations by workers and staff across the country in the form of great airing, great contending, great debate, and big-character posters will surely unify and improve the understanding of the masses of workers and staff on labor wage and labor insurance welfare issues, thereby facilitating the implementation of the policy of taking into account all aspects and making appropriate arrangements and various specific policies.

    从六亿人口出发，进一步解决某些劳动工资和劳保福利问题
    今天国务院公布了已经经过全国人民代表大会常务委员会原则批准的关于改进某些劳动工资和劳保福利的四项暂行规定草案；并且决定各地指定一些重点厂矿、企业、事业单位和机关、团体、学校，组织工人（包括普通工、勤杂工、学徒）、职员结合当前的整风运动进行广泛传达和讨论。这四项暂行规定草案是：关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定（草案）；关于企业、事业和国家机关中普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定（草案）；关于国营、公私合营、合作社营、个体经营的企业和事业单位的学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定（草案）；关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定（草案）。劳动工资和劳保福利问题，是关系着广大人民生活的重大问题，也是体现社会主义生产和分配制度的重大问题。把这样重大的问题提交广大职工讨论，是我国人民民主生活中的一件大事。
    我国的劳动工资和劳保福利工作，八年来是有很大的成绩的。从劳动就业方面看，八年中新增加职工一千三百万人，不仅大批新成长的劳动力就了业，旧社会遗留下来的近四百万失业人员，也已经基本上得到安置。目前一般职工家庭平均人口约为四人左右，而每个职工家庭的平均就业人口就约有一点三三人。从工资工作方面看，我们从根本上改变了半殖民地半封建性的工资制度，建立了基本上符合社会主义按劳付酬原则的工资制度。绝大多数职工的工资水平都提高了。第一个五年计划期间全国职工的平均工资原定增长33％，预计将增长42．8％。1957年全国职工年平均工资预计达到六百三十六元，月平均工资预计达到五十三元。再从劳保福利方面看，解放以来逐步实行了劳动保险和公费医疗，举办了各种集体福利和个人福利事业，改善了广大职工群众的物质生活和文化生活，帮助广大劳动人民解决了在旧社会依靠个人能力无法解决的生、老、病、死、伤、残的困苦。第一个五年计划期间，企业、事业单位和国家机关支出的附加工资和各种福利费用，预计约为九十六亿多元，等于工资总额的19．2％。如果再加上国家用于社会的文教卫生和社会福利等经费中职工享受的部分，就达到工资总额的25％以上。就业人数的增加，工资水平的提高，劳保福利的增长，保证了职工生活的逐步改善，同时激发了广大职工的劳动积极性和对于社会主义制度的无比热爱。我国劳动工资和劳保福利工作中的重大成就，集中地说明了一个问题：这就是社会主义制度要比历史上任何旧的社会制度优越得多。社会主义制度促进生产力以旧中国和资本主义国家所不可能有的速度向前发展，在这个基础上，保证了我们能够逐步解决旧中国所不能解决的有关改善广大人民生活的种种问题。这一切乃是中国人民革命胜利的果实，是谁也不能否定的。
    至于劳动工资和劳保福利工作中的缺点和错误，当然也不少。在劳动就业方面，就业出路主要面向了城市、机关、企业和事业，而没有强调面向农村，以及从手工业、服务性行业、各种辅助性劳动等方面广开社会就业的门路；有些不适宜或者不必要就业的人被安排了工作，有些迫切需要就业的人反而没有及时得到安置。在工资工作方面，由于对城乡关系、新老职工关系和青年知识分子的待遇安排有不够恰当的地方，某些工资标准和工资制度的规定不够合理，因而城乡结合部工作人员，低级工作人员，学徒和青年知识分子的工资水平偏高。在工资制度的改革上，主要的缺点是和我国的实际情况结合不够，在某些问题上忽视了因地制宜，过分强调了集中统一。在工资工作中，还过多地强调了物质鼓励作用，放松了对职工群众的思想政治工作，因而助长了职工群众中个人主义、本位主义和平均主义思想的发展。在劳保福利方面，某些方面走得快了，某些项目办得多了，某些规定不太合理，并且有苦乐不均和浪费的现象。
    劳动工资和劳保福利工作中的这些缺点和错误，无疑是不利于国家的建设事业的。我们的国家是一个人口多底子穷的国家。人多，劳动力多，这是好事；但是也正由于我国人口众多，因而尽管解放以来我国的生产有了突飞猛进的发展，而生活资料的增产对于六亿人民日益增长的需要说来，还是比较慢的。这就不能不给安排劳动就业和改善人民生活带来若干困难。在这种情况下，解决劳动工资和劳保福利问题，必须从六亿人口出发，从统筹兼顾全国人民的生活首先是工农生活、适当安排城乡关系这个基本观点出发，实行合理的低工资制，尽量使大家都有工作做，都有饭吃，并且在发展生产的基础上，使工农的生活能够逐步得到改善。前一个时期的劳动工资和劳保福利工作中所以会产生一些缺点和错误，最主要的原因也就在于我们对于我国人口多、底子穷这个根本情况认识不透，对于从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针体会不深。这也就是我们在劳动工资和劳保福利工作方面所应该记取的最主要的教训。
    从六亿人口出发，从统筹兼顾、适当安排的基本方针出发，今后的劳动就业，应该从多方面开辟就业门路。我国的工业、建筑业、交通运输业以及商业和文教卫生事业，虽然发展都很快，但是由于我国人口众多，每年新成长的劳动力为数很大，上述各部门只能吸收一部分劳动力；而我国的农业，则能够容纳更大量的劳动力。目前全国共有七十五万个农业社，只要每个社能够安置五个人，全国就可以安置三百七十五万人。因此，对于城市中多余的劳动力，主要地应该鼓励他们下乡、上山，参加农林业劳动。我国的手工业和服务性行业，也能够容纳较多的劳动力，应该在这些方面多找寻就业的门路。此外，还应该宣传从事家务劳动也是光荣的。家务劳动是社会劳动必不可少的一部分，家庭妇女能够勤俭持家，把家务搞好，使得丈夫子女能够积极从事各种劳动，同样是对国家和社会的贡献，她们的丈夫子女所得到的劳动报酬中，也有她们从事家务劳动应得的代价在内。
    从六亿人口出发，从统筹兼顾、适当安排的基本方针出发，今后职工的工资福利必须更好地与我国人口多、底子穷、生产水平还相当低的实际情况相适应。必须正确地安排生产与生活的系关、工农关系及工人阶级内部的关系。应该继续实行合理的低工资制，既要保证广大职工物质生活的适当需要，并且在生产发展的基础上逐步有所改善，又要防止和克服脱离农民的城乡生活相差过大的现象。在这个前提下，对于某些不合理的工资标准、工资制度和劳保福利制度，应该有步骤地进行调整和改进。只有这样，才能够做到统筹兼顾，公平合理。
    国务院公布的四项暂行规定草案，正是进一步体现从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾、适当安排这一基本方针的具体措施。学徒规定不仅是对于我国学徒制度的重大改革，并且对于我国劳动工资制度的许多方面会产生比较深远的影响，将促使劳动工资制度更进一步地符合于我国的实际情况。这个规定纠正了过去几年中学徒学习时间过短和待遇偏高的严重缺点，这就为扩大就业和坚持实行合理的低工资制度打下了基础。这个规定为我国广大青年开辟了广阔得多的就业门路，因为学徒的学习期限一经延长，在同一时间内学习的学徒的人数就增加了。并且这个规定还将大大鼓励手工业、服务性行业和广大的个体劳动者乐于招收培养学徒。这个规定有益于我国青年和我国建设事业的另一方面，就是它为今后培养技术好、思想好、身体好的工人阶级的新生一代提供了保证。工人、职员退休规定的重要意义，就在于既可以妥善地安置那些年老的和身体衰弱丧失劳动能力的人员，又可以使更多的青年能够就业。据估算，今后每退休一个年老职工，就可以多吸收一个到两个青年学徒。这样，就把国家建设事业、老年人和青年人的利益，统筹兼顾到了。为了适当地满足职工回家探亲的要求、统一待遇和控制城市人口的增加，国务院制定了关于工人、职员回家探亲的暂行规定。这个规定也是从统筹兼顾的精神出发的。根据我国当前的具体条件，在有关国家与个人、城市与乡村、职工内部的关系上，作了适当的安排。普通工和勤杂工是城市与农村劳动者的结合部分。目前这部分工人的工资待遇偏高，对于城乡关系、工农关系、城市工作和农业生产，都有不利。国务院关于普通工和勤杂工工资待遇的规定，适当地解决了这一问题。综上所述，根据统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针而制定的这四项规定草案，是完全符合我们国家和工人、农民、广大青年的利益的。可以断言，不久这四个规定付诸实施以后，必将推动我国劳动工资制度的进一步改善，给我国社会主义建设事业带来许多益处。
    现在，国务院的四项规定草案就要由全国职工和有关方面进行广泛讨论了。我们在前面提供了我国劳动工资和劳保福利工作的基本情况和论述了这方面的一些基本问题，作为大家讨论时的参考。目前，企业、事业、国家机关和人民团体在整风中，已经掀起了关于劳动工资和劳保福利问题的热烈讨论，反映出各种不同的认识，有正确的，也有不正确的。我们希望，通过对于四项规定草案的讨论，在全国职工中进一步地展开关于劳动工资和劳保福利问题的争辩。我们党和政府的一切工作，从来都强调走群众路线。相信群众的多数，把一项政策、一项规定交给群众讨论，经过讨论，群众了解了情况，明白了道理，实行起来容易；若是政策有不周全处，规定有不合适的地方，也可以吸取群众的意见及早修正。这种群众路线的方法，也就是社会主义民主的方法。经过这次全民整风运动，群众路线的方法又有了新的发展，出现了大放大鸣、大辩论、大字报等社会主义民主的新形式。这种形式同样可以、而且应该运用来解决我们工作上的问题。我们相信，由全国职工用大放大鸣、大辩论、大字报等形式来对国务院的四项规定草案展开讨论，必然能够统一和提高职工群众对劳动工资和劳保福利问题的认识，从而有利于统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针和各项具体政策的贯彻实施。
