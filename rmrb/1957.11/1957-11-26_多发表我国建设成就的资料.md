    Publish More Materials on China's Construction Achievements

    I think the "Figures and Facts" published in the People's Daily are very good. They have great socialist educational significance and are valuable materials for publicizing the great achievements of our country's construction. I hope you can publish more of such materials. Moreover, please write in a more vivid way, and provide appropriate explanations for some specialized terms, so that it will play a greater role. For example, in the "Railways Past and Present" published on page 3 on November 15th, it would be best to add an explanation of how many kilometers of railway were built after liberation, equivalent to the distance from where to where, so that people will have a more profound impression. Also, specialized terms such as "converted ton-kilometers" need to be briefly explained.

    多发表我国建设成就的资料
    人民日报所刊载的“数字与事实”，我觉得非常好，具有很大的社会主义教育意义，也是宣传我国建设伟大成就的宝贵资料，希望你们能够多发表这样的资料。并且请你们写得更形象化，把有些专门名辞加以适当的解释，这样将会起到更大的作用。例如，11月15日第三版刊载的“铁路今昔”中，解放后修建了多少公里铁路，最好能附带说明等于从何处到何处的路程，给人印象就比较深刻。又如“换算吨公里”等专门名词也需要加以简单的解释。
