Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th. The head of the Soviet government delegation, Morozov, attending the Fourth Asian Regional Conference of the International Labour Organization, declared at the plenary meeting on the afternoon of November 19th his opposition to the illegal attendance of elements of the Chiang Kai-shek clique at the conference.

Speaking during the discussion of the Director-General's report, Morozov said that the absence of representatives from the People's Republic of China at this conference was abnormal and not in the interest of the conference's effective work. The absence of representatives from the People's Republic of China was sufficient to undermine the prestige of the International Labour Organization's conferences, as the International Labour Organization should be a broadly representative organization.

The Soviet delegation has submitted a statement to the Chairman of the Conference opposing the illegal attendance of elements of the Chiang Kai-shek clique at this conference and demanding the restoration of the representation of the People's Republic of China.

The Indian government delegation attending the conference has submitted a proposal to the conference requesting that the People's Republic of China be granted representation.

The head of the Soviet government delegation also pointed out at the meeting that the Director-General's report did not give due importance to the achievements of the People's Republic of China in developing its economy and improving the people's living standards, and that the report was based on the principle that "two Chinas" exist. Morozov said that the Soviet delegation firmly opposes this practice.

    国际劳工组织亚洲区域会议在印举行
    苏联声明反对蒋帮代表参加  印度建议应该给我国代表权
    据新华社新德里20日电　出席国际劳工组织第四次亚洲区域会议的苏联政府代表团团长莫罗佐夫在11月19日下午全体会议上，声明反对蒋介石集团分子非法出席会议。
    莫罗佐夫在会议讨论总干事的报告时说，没有中华人民共和国的代表参加这次会议，这是不正常的，也是不符合会议的卓有成效的工作的利益的。这次会议没有中华人民共和国代表参加足以破坏国际劳工组织的会议的威信，因为国际劳工组织应当是具有广泛代表性的组织。
    苏联代表团已经向会议主席提出声明，反对蒋介石集团分子非法出席这个会议，并且要求恢复中华人民共和国的代表权。
    出席会议的印度政府代表团已经向会议提出提案，要求给予中华人民共和国以代表权。
    苏联政府代表团团长在会议上还指出，总干事的报告中没有对中华人民共和国在发展经济和提高人民生活水平方面的成就给予应有的重视，而且这个报告是根据存在着“两个中国”的原则出发的。莫罗佐夫说，苏联代表团坚决反对这个做法。
