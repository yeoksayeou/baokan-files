Such is the "Free World"

　　France: Murder Cases Emerge in Endless Stream
　　The social news section of any French newspaper invariably carries several murder cases every day.

　　According to materials from the French monthly "Réalités," approximately 1,600 murder cases occur in France each year. The police are so accustomed to these cases that they don't bother trying to hunt down the murderers. Consequently, 40% of the cases remain unsolved each year.

　　"Réalités" magazine statistics show that since 1947, 6,500 murderers have escaped after committing their crimes and are still living freely.

    法凶杀案层出不穷
    法国任何一家报纸的社会新闻版每天都短不了登载几起凶杀案件。
    据法国“现实”月刊的材料，每年在法国大约发生一千六百起凶杀案件，而警察局对这些案件已司空见惯，因而也并不努力去追缉凶手，所以每年都有40％的案件不能破获。
    “现实”杂志统计，从1947年以来已有六千五百个凶手在行凶后逃逸，现在仍然自由自在地生活着。
