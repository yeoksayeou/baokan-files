    中苏两国科学家联欢
    一致认为应扩大合作解决重大科学问题
    据新华社莫斯科28日电　一千多名苏联科学工作者、莫斯科各企业的劳动人民代表、莫斯科各高等学校的学生和研究生，26日同以郭沫若为首的中国访苏科学技术代表团的科学家们举行了联欢晚会。
    苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫代表苏联科学家向中国朋友们表示欢迎。他说，苏联和中国在互助基础上进行科学技术合作已经有好几年了。两国科学家一致认为，必须更加扩大这种合作，必须发展更高级的合作形式，以便共同解决许多重大的科学技术问题。
    到会者非常注意地听取了郭沫若团长在会上的讲话。他说，我们认为，要进一步发展我们的科学工作，必须扩大同苏联科学家的合作。具体地讨论这种合作问题是我们代表团到这里来的重要目的之一。几年来中国在建设方面和科学方面的成就是同苏联的无私援助分不开的，是同中国采用苏联先进经验分不开的。
