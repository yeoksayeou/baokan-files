    Determination to Firmly Follow the Socialist Road
    Seven Thousand Small Vendors in Zhengzhou Engage in Extensive Airing of Views, Debates, and Discussions
    (Our Dispatch) Zhengzhou, Henan – Over seven thousand small vendors in thirty trades, including commerce, service, and catering, in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, fully launched an extensive airing of views in early October, which has now reached a climax. Some shops and groups, based on thorough airing of views, have entered the stage of extensive debates.
    Before conducting socialist education among small vendors, Zhengzhou City organized a substantial force and made meticulous preparations. The provincial and municipal Party and government leading organs jointly organized a temporary office, drawing 418 cadres from various organs and enterprises to form five work teams that went deep into various districts to work. The entire movement plan was divided into four stages: extensive airing of views, extensive debates and discussions, education and handling, consolidation and improvement (establishing systems and conventions, revising regulations, and establishing grassroots organizations). Before the extensive airing of views, each district conducted detailed preliminary investigations and sorting work. The district head or the finance and trade minister made mobilization reports to the small vendors, calling on them to help Party and government organs at all levels and relevant enterprise departments to rectify their work style and to boldly air their views. They were also asked to criticize and suggest improvements on the problems existing within the shops and groups. Because the leaders personally mobilized, clearly explained the policies, and basically dispelled their ideological concerns about retaliation and unresolved problems, their enthusiasm for airing views was very high. In the first week of airing views, small vendors throughout the city put forward 5,482 opinions; in the second week, this rose to 12,361; and in the third week, it rose again to 25,664. At present, the airing of views continues to develop in a deeper, more thorough, and broader direction.
    Local Party and government organs and relevant departments attach great importance to the opinions raised by the small vendors. Each district office has assigned personnel to sort out these opinions, and those that can be resolved are studied and resolved immediately. Cooperative shops and groups have also implemented the spirit of rectifying while airing views. Some have established rectification groups, and others have entrusted the shop affairs committee to handle the opinions raised during the airing of views. During the airing of views, each industry generally raised the issue that the increase in illegal operators after the opening of the free market affected legitimate business, and criticized the relevant government departments for relaxing market management. Based on this opinion, the Market Management Committee immediately began rectification and eliminated 500 illegal operators. The advanced Yanjiu Cooperative Shop in the Erqi District held three shop affairs committee meetings and two employee representative meetings during the airing of views to study the 192 opinions put forward by the employees, and resolved 148 of them. For example, business meetings were rarely held for several months in the past, but now it has been decided to hold a business meeting on the first day of every ten-day period. The long-standing problem of overstocking and shortages has now been found to be due to a lack of coordination despite the division of labor. It has now been decided that the purchasing, storage, and business committee members will meet every night to check the day's purchase and sales situation and determine the next day's purchase and sales tasks. Because leaders at all levels and cooperative shops and groups resolutely implemented the principle of rectifying while correcting, they greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for airing their views, expanded the ranks of activists, and laid a good foundation for future extensive debates.
    During the extensive airing of views, some small vendors put forward some erroneous remarks. He Yutong of the Heping Tofu Shop said, "Collectivization has no advantages, and the new society is not as good as the old society." Wang Shiqi of the Advanced Yanjiu Cooperative Shop said, "Everyone else is liberated, but I am not. My turnover is high, but my income is low. The shop is exploiting me." In response to these remarks, each cooperative shop used methods such as presenting the facts, reasoning things out, recalling the past and comparing it with the present, and summarizing accounts to carry out debates. When refuting Wang Shiqi's remarks, someone in the Advanced Yanjiu Cooperative Shop used Wang's own facts to argue with him: "When you were working individually, your monthly income was 30 yuan, and part of that was obtained by underreporting turnover and evading taxes. Now your monthly income is 50 to 60 yuan. How can you say you are not liberated?" Some people said, "Your turnover is high because the collectivization is strong. A small cart was replaced with a small wooden shed for you, and then the small wooden shed was replaced with a large stall, and electric lights were installed. Only then did the turnover rise from 200 yuan to 1,700 yuan. Is that due to Wang Shiqi's efforts alone?" Someone else refuted him, saying, "The shop has given you relief every time (subsidized four times, a total of 70 yuan). How has the shop let you down? You really don't know how lucky you are!" These words and ironclad facts touched Wang Shiqi's sore spot. He lowered his head and admitted his mistake, saying, "In the old society, when my child was sick, his mother cried and ran through several streets but couldn't borrow any money. Now the shop takes care of me in every way. It's all my fault, I forgot my roots. From now on, I will definitely follow the socialist road well."
    The Heping Tofu Shop conducted two days of heated debate on He Yutong's remarks. Everyone used the changes in the enterprise to reason with him. Someone said, "When we worked individually, we used a wooden mill to grind tofu. In the early days of collectivization, we used donkeys to pull it. Now we use electric power to grind it. How can you say collectivization is not superior?" Others gave He Yutong a detailed account. Before liberation, he and his brother were apprentices, earning only four dan of wheat (equivalent to 80 yuan) each year. Their family could not even afford to eat their fill. Now, not only have he and his brother joined the cooperative shop, but two women have also joined the labor force, with a total monthly income of 204 yuan. Now one month is better than one year in the past. In the past, he wore ragged clothes, but now he wears serge clothing. In the past, he pulled the mill barefoot when it rained, but now he wears rubber boots. Through presenting the facts and reasoning things out, He Yutong also admitted his mistake in front of everyone, and examined his past mistakes of opposing leadership and wanting to work individually, and expressed that he would resolutely follow the socialist road in the future. The small vendors who participated in the meeting also received a profound education in the debate.
    Recently, Zhengzhou City convened a meeting of district heads and finance and trade ministers of each district to summarize the experience of extensive airing of views and debates, and made arrangements to organize small vendors throughout the city to launch a high tide of socialist debate after the high tide of extensive airing of views.

    坚定走社会主义道路的决心
    郑州七千小商贩大鸣大放大争大辩
    本报讯  河南省郑州市商业、服务业、饮食业三十个行业的小商小贩七千多人，在10月上旬全面展开大鸣大放，目前已经形成高潮。部分商店和小组在鸣放深透的基础上，已经进入大辩论的阶段。
    郑州市对小商小贩进行社会主义教育之前，曾经组织了较大的力量，作了细致的准备工作。省市党政领导机关共同组织了一个临时办公室，由各机关企业抽调了四百一十八名干部组成五个工作队，深入各区进行工作。整个运动计划分为大鸣大放、大争大辩、教育处理、巩固提高（定制度公约、修订章程和建立基层组织）四个阶段。在大鸣大放以前，各区都作了细致的摸底排队工作，由各区区长或财贸部长向小商贩作动员报告，号召他们帮助各级党政和归口企业部门整风，大胆地鸣放，同时对店、组内部存在的问题提出批评和改进意见。由于领导亲自动员，清楚地交代了政策，基本上打消了他们怕打击报复、怕不解决问题等思想顾虑，因而鸣放情绪十分高涨。鸣放第一周，全市小商小贩提出意见五千四百八十二条，第二周升至一万二千三百六十一条，第三周又升到二万五千六百六十四条。目前，鸣放仍在继续向深、透、广的方向发展。
    对于小商小贩提出的意见，当地党政和有关归口单位都非常重视。各区办公室都设有专人整理这些意见，能解决的都立即研究解决。各合作商店、小组也贯彻了边鸣放、边改进的精神，有的成立整改小组，有的由店务委员会负责处理鸣放中提出的意见。在鸣放中，各行业普遍提出，自由市场开放后黑户增加，影响正当经营，并批评政府有关部门放松了对市场的管理。市场管理委员会根据这一意见，立即开始整顿，取缔了五百户黑户。二七区先进烟酒合作商店在鸣放过程中，开过三次店务委员会和两次店员代表会，研究了店员提出的一百九十二条意见，并且解决了一百四十八条。如过去常几个月不开业务会议，现在决定每旬第一天开一次业务会；过去长期没有解决好积压与脱销的问题，这次找出关键在于有了分工没有联系，现在确定采购、保管、业务三个委员每晚碰一次头，检查当天购销情况，确定第二天购销任务。由于各级领导和合作店、组坚决贯彻边整边改方针，大大地鼓舞了群众鸣放的积极性，扩大了积极分子的队伍，为今后大争大辩打下了良好的基础。
    在大鸣大放中，有的小商小贩提出了一些错误的言论。和平豆腐店何玉同提出：“合作化没啥优越性，新社会不如旧社会。”先进烟酒合作商店王士奇提出：“都解放了，我没解放，我的营业额多，收入少，店里剥削我。”对这类言论，各合作商店都用摆事实、讲道理、回忆对比、总结算账等方式展开辩论。先进烟酒合作商店有人在驳斥王士奇的言论时，就用王本人的事实来同他争辩：“单干时你每月收入三十元，其中一部分还是由于少报营业额、偷税漏税取得的；现在你每月收入五十到六十元，怎能说你没有解放？”有的人说：“你营业额做的多，是因为合作化力量大，由小车给你换上了小木房，又由小木房换上了大摊亭，还装上了电灯，业营额才由二百元上升到一千七百元，难道是你王士奇一个人的力量？”又有人驳他说：“店里救济每一次都有你（补助四次，共七十元），店里哪一点对不住你，你真是身在福中不知福！”这些话和铁的事实说到了王士奇伤心之处，他低头认错，并说：“在旧社会，我孩子有病，他妈哭着跑几道街都借不来钱，现在店里处处照顾我。这都是我不好，忘了本，今后我一定好好地走社会主义道路。”
    和平豆腐店对何玉同的言论进行了两天热烈的辩论。大家用企业的变化来同他说理。有人说：“单干时我们磨豆腐用木晃磨，合作化初期用驴拉，现在用电力磨，怎能说合作化不优越？”还有人给何玉同算了细账，解放前他弟兄二人给人家当学徒，每年每人只赚四石麦（合八十元），一家不得温饱；现在不但他弟兄二人参加合作商店，两个妇女也参加了劳动，每月共收入二百零四元，现在一月胜过过去一年。过去他穿的是破衣裤，现在穿的是哔叽衣服；过去下雨时赤脚拉磨，现在穿半统胶靴。通过摆事实、讲道理，何玉同也在大家面前认了错，并检查了过去反对领导、想单干等错误，表示今后坚决走社会主义道路。参加会议的小商贩，在辩论中也都受到了深刻的教育。
    最近，郑州市召开了各区区长、各区委财贸部长会议，总结大鸣大放大争的经验，并进行了部署，准备组织全市小商小贩在大鸣大放高潮之后，掀起一个社会主义大辩论的高潮。
