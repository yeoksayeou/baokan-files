Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch: The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is undertaking vigorous promotion of the Li language to meet the pressing demands of the Li people to learn the language as quickly as possible.

　　Currently, the Autonomous Prefecture's National Languages School is stepping up the training of the first group of teachers and full-time cadres to promote the Li language. Specific plans for promoting the Li language in rural areas, government organs, and schools next year have been formulated. According to the plan, each county will select three to six townships for key promotion, with an enrollment target of 12,000 students. Primary schools in counties, districts, and townships with better conditions will begin pilot teaching of the Li language in the first grade. Cadre and worker spare-time cultural schools in various places will add Li language classes. Primary school teachers who will be trained by the Autonomous Prefecture's Normal School starting next year will also study the Li language, so that they can master teaching in the Li language in the future. In addition, there are plans to train more than 1,000 Li language teachers and full-time cadres in two phases next year.

　　The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has a Li population of more than 300,000. In the past, the Li people did not have a written language. In the first half of this year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Minority Languages Survey Team helped the Li people create one.

    海南黎族苗族自治州
    大力推行黎文
    据新华社28日讯　海南黎族苗族自治州正着手大力推行黎文，以满足黎族人民希望尽快学会黎文的迫切要求。
    现在，自治州民族语文学校正在加紧训练第一批推行黎文的教师和专职干部。明年在农村、机关、学校推行黎文的具体计划已经制订出来。按照计划，各县每个区选择三个到六个乡重点推行，入学人数要求达到一万二千名；条件较好的县、区、乡小学，将在一年级开始试教黎文；各地的干部、职工业余文化学校将加设黎文班。自治州师范学校明年开始调训的小学教师，也将学习黎文，以便今后能掌握用黎文教学。此外，还计划在明年分两期培养出一千多名黎文教师和专职干部。
  海南黎族苗族自治州共有黎族三十多万人。过去黎族没有文字，今年上半年中国科学院少数民族语言调查工作队帮助黎族创造了一种文字。
