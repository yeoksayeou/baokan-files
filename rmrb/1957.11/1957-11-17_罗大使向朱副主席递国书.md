Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The new Romanian Ambassador to China, Rudenko, accompanied by First Secretary of the Embassy, Bashkirov, and all diplomatic officials, presented his credentials to Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, on the afternoon of the 16th.

Present were Zhang Wentian, Yu Xinqing, Li Huichuan, and Ma Zhenwu.

Ambassador Rudenko delivered a eulogy when presenting his credentials, and Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a reply.

In his eulogy, Ambassador Rudenko, on behalf of the Romanian people, the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic, and the Government of the Romanian People's Republic, extended sincere and warm brotherly greetings to Vice Chairman Zhu De, the Chinese government, and the great Chinese people. He expressed his profound satisfaction that, as the Ambassador of the Romanian People's Republic to the great, friendly socialist country, he would be able to contribute to the consolidation and development of the eternal friendship between the two countries.

Ambassador Rudenko said that the Romanian working people are watching with love and admiration the great cause of socialist construction that is developing rapidly in a country of 600 million people. The 600 million people liberated by the Chinese revolution have been forever freed from the shackles of imperialism. The free Romanian people, who are masters of their own destiny, regard the great and historically significant achievements that the Chinese people have attained under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party as their own achievements, because they know that, with the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp, the progress and achievements of each socialist country are also reflected in all other countries.

Ambassador Rudenko said that the Government of the Romanian People's Republic notes with satisfaction that our two countries, which are closely united in the invincible family of socialist countries headed by the great Soviet Union, are constantly developing and strengthening relations in all fields for the happiness of the Romanian and Chinese people, and for socialism and world peace. Our common socialist system and the spirit of proletarian internationalism generated by this system are prerequisites for the increasing development and prosperity of relations between our countries and between our peoples.

Ambassador Rudenko concluded by saying that, as the Ambassador of the Romanian People's Republic to the People's Republic of China, he will spare no effort to promote the consolidation and development of fraternal relations between Romania and China.

In his reply, Vice Chairman Zhu De said that the Romanian people are freedom-loving, peace-loving, diligent and courageous people. They have waged many heroic and resolute struggles for freedom and independence. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and the government, the Romanian people have overcome numerous difficulties, consolidated the people's democratic regime, restored and developed the national economy, and transformed Romania from a backward agricultural country into a socialist agricultural-industrial country. The Romanian people have also made important contributions to the struggle to ease international tensions. The Chinese people admire the significant achievements made by the Romanian people in the cause of socialist construction and in the struggle to safeguard European and world peace, and are encouraged by these achievements.

Vice Chairman Zhu said that in recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Romania in the political, economic, and cultural fields have witnessed encouraging and comprehensive development. He is deeply convinced that the ever-developing cooperation between the two countries in all fields will not only further deepen the fraternal friendship between the two peoples, but will also greatly help to strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, thereby making greater contributions to the lofty cause of world peace and human progress.

Vice Chairman Zhu concluded by saying: "Ambassador, I warmly welcome you to serve again as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Romanian People's Republic to the People's Republic of China. In your work to further consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations between the Romanian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China, you will receive my full support and the full support of the Government of the People's Republic of China."

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The new Romanian Ambassador to China, Rudenko, paid a courtesy call on Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, this afternoon to discuss matters concerning the presentation of his credentials.

Present were Li Huichuan, Deputy Director of the Department of Soviet and East European Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ma Zhenwu, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department.
