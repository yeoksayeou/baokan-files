Following the decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, Beijing's opera circle entered a new stage of rectification movement in mid-October—a major debate. The debate first unfolded within the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, with the main topics of contention being: the relationship between opera and Party leadership, the relationship between politics and art, the work of opera reform, and the direction of folk professional opera troupes. Over the past month, the troupe's 192 members have been divided into six groups for discussion. Among them, the issue of politics versus art triggered a fierce debate. Currently, the discussion on this issue has temporarily come to an end, and the troupe has basically entered the stage of rectification and reform. The majority's understanding has shifted from "art first" to "politics first," and everyone's ideology has significantly improved.

Before the start of the debate at the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture sent a special working group to assist. Because the anti-Rightist struggle had just ended, many people initially had concerns and were unwilling to speak. The working group repeatedly mobilized them, explaining that the debate mainly aimed to distinguish between major rights and wrongs, ensuring "three nos" – no blocking, no coercion, and no labeling – to allow everyone to speak their minds. Problems that arose during the debate were reported and resolved on the same day. Therefore, the debate proceeded relatively smoothly and enthusiastically. The debate mainly took the form of small group discussions, supplemented by the posting of big-character posters.

Starting from October 29th, five units, including the Beijing Ping Opera Troupe, Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 4, the Emerging Peking Opera Troupe, the New China Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe, and the Beijing Opera School, also began major debates. Eight more units are scheduled to launch debates by the end of this month. Eventually, all troupes in Beijing and folk scattered artists will be organized to participate in major debates.

    北京戏曲界展开大辩论
    本报讯　北京市戏曲界在反右派斗争取得决定性胜利后，10月中旬即转入了大辩论的整风运动新阶段。辩论首先在北京京剧团内展开，争辩的主要内容有：戏曲事业与党的领导、政治与艺术的关系、戏曲改革工作和民间职业剧团的方向等问题。一个月来，剧团的一百九十二人分了六个小组进行讨论，其中关于政治与艺术的问题，曾引起了一场激烈的争论。目前，关于这个问题的讨论已暂告一段落，剧团基本上进入整改工作。多数人的认识已从“艺术第一”转变为“政治第一”，大家在思想上都有了显著的提高。
    北京京剧团在辩论开始前，北京市文化局即派了一个专门工作组前往辅助。由于反右派斗争刚结束，最初，很多人顾虑较大、不愿发言。工作组曾反复动员，解释辩论主要是分清大是大非，保证“三不”——不堵、不逼、不扣帽子，让大家讲心里话。辩论中发生的问题，当天汇报，当天解决，因此，辩论开展得比较顺利、热烈。辩论主要采取小组座谈方式，也张贴了大字报配合进行。
    10月29日起，北京市评剧团、北京市京剧四团、新兴京剧团、新中华河北梆子剧团和北京市戏曲学校五个单位也开始了大辩论，本月底还有八个单位要展开辩论，最后，北京市所有剧团和民间流散艺人将全部组织进行大辩论。
