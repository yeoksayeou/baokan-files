Everyone Should Support Agriculture

    While the entire nation is discussing the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956-1967, why should people from all walks of life, in addition to farmers and rural workers, actively participate in this discussion? Because we must mobilize the strength of all sectors of the country to support agriculture.

    Our Party and government have never relaxed their attention to agriculture. Not only do the farmers devote all their efforts to actively developing agricultural production, but the Party and the state have also spent enormous efforts to lead the development of agriculture. Agricultural production in recent years has greatly exceeded the level of old China, ensuring the basic needs of the country and the people, and avoiding the danger of separation between industry and agriculture. However, because China's original agricultural base was too backward, and the demand for grain, cotton, oil crops, etc. has grown rapidly since liberation, the development of agricultural production still lags far behind the growth of needs. In order to ensure the food and clothing of 600 million people, and also to further ensure and promote the development of industry, we must make efforts to develop agriculture in all aspects in the future. Chairman Mao instructed us: "During the Second and Third Five-Year Plans, if our agriculture can have greater development, and the light industry can have more corresponding development, it will be beneficial to the entire national economy. With the development of agriculture and light industry, heavy industry will have markets, and funds, and it will develop faster."

    The report of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, published in this newspaper on October 14 and 15, powerfully illustrated the importance of strengthening the cooperation of various aspects of work with agricultural production. The report pointed out that if the industrial sector can supply rice transplanters and harvesters, it can greatly save labor and increase the area of multiple cropping; if each cooperative has a universal suction hammer mill, it can make full use of cereal stalks and ensure feed for raising four pigs per household. For example, the investment of 620,000 yuan in 1956 to open up more than 100 kilometers of forest roads and waterways increased timber production by 560,000 cubic meters, and the state and farmers benefited by more than 10 million yuan. These examples fully illustrate a truth, that is, the socialist economy is a whole, and agriculture cannot achieve greater development without the assistance of other aspects. Similarly, industry, commerce, handicrafts, and transportation cannot develop independently without agriculture. Therefore, in the process of realizing this program, although the main reliance is on the farmers' own strength, at the same time, industrial and mining transportation enterprises, financial, trade and supply and marketing cooperatives, and scientific, cultural and educational systems must also undertake certain tasks, and there are many, many jobs that must be done well.

    Developing agriculture requires first of all the support of industry. Industry must produce more chemical fertilizers, agricultural machinery, insecticides, medicines and daily necessities for agricultural production. This is a basic condition for developing agricultural production and improving the lives of farmers. In terms of the use of chemical fertilizers, Japan is a country that uses a relatively large amount of chemical fertilizers. In 1955, the average fertilizer application per mu was 123.3 jin, and the average grain yield per mu was 408 jin, making it one of the countries with high yields in the world. According to the situation of using chemical fertilizers in rural areas of China, each jin of nitrogen fertilizer can increase rice production by 3 to 5 jin, wheat by 2 to 3 jin, and seed cotton by more than 1 jin; each jin of phosphate fertilizer can increase grain production by 1.5 jin and seed cotton by 0.5 jin. The Chaoshan area of Guangdong and the Laiyang area of Shandong, which have the longest and most chemical fertilizer use in China, also have very high yields. The former has an annual rice yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and the latter has an annual wheat yield of 500 jin per mu. However, from the perspective of the whole country, due to backward technology and insufficient fertilizer (now China has an average of only 1.44 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu), the average grain yield of the whole country, in 1955, the year before the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program was proposed and implemented, was only 197 jin per mu, which is far behind China's highest yield. Therefore, in order to increase the yield per unit area in China, in addition to striving for other necessary measures, it is still necessary to greatly increase the production and supply of chemical fertilizers at present to supplement the shortage of livestock manure and natural fertilizers. In terms of the use of agricultural machinery, after agricultural cooperation, the rural labor force is not as surplus as some people once imagined. Due to the expansion of multiple cropping areas, the increase in water conservancy projects, the increasingly meticulous cultivation, and the increasingly diversified sideline businesses, the demand for human and animal power has greatly increased, so the demand for using machines to replace human and animal power has become more and more urgent. Some of the larger-scale basic construction projects in rural areas also need the support of mechanical power. Therefore, manufacturing various agricultural machines suitable for needs and supplying them to farmers is an important condition for further developing agricultural production. In addition, in improving agricultural production technology, in eliminating pests and diseases, in meeting the material and cultural life of farmers, etc., there are many, many places that require industrial support. These are all the obligations of the entire working class. China's working class and industrial and mining enterprises must provide huge assistance to agricultural construction and farmer brothers in all aspects.

    To develop agriculture, it is necessary to carry out a serious struggle with nature, prevent natural disasters, and utilize natural conditions. This requires scientific institutions, water conservancy departments, meteorological units, etc. to provide huge assistance. At present, what urgently needs to be solved in China is to reduce floods, droughts, and waterlogging, and to expand the irrigation area, striving to ensure production on the one hand and increase production on the other. According to eight years of experience, in China, north of the Huai River, floods are more frequent than droughts, and waterlogging is more frequent than floods. In the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, an average of 50 million to 100 million mu of low-lying land is flooded every year, and 10 to 20 billion jin of grain is lost every year. From 1953 to 1956, the area of cultivated land in the country that suffered natural disasters was about 770 million mu, with an average of 190 million mu per year. The grain lost due to disasters averaged 18.7 billion jin per year, and cotton 2 million dan. If we can get all the grain and cotton that could be harvested, it would be a huge increase in production! We must strive to tame nature, so that it can give us more food, and we cannot let disasters take away large amounts of food from our land every year in vain. An important aspect of utilizing nature is to strive to expand the irrigation area. On the one hand, this can dredge waterlogging, and on the other hand, it can strengthen drought resistance, thereby increasing production. At present, China's irrigation area accounts for only 30% of the cultivated land, which is a very low percentage. According to China's production experience, changing dry land to paddy fields, plus the necessary fertilizer and improvement of cultivation techniques, can increase production by an average of one time or more per mu. As long as we can change 200 million mu of land to paddy fields first, we can increase production by tens of billions of jin of grain every year. Such huge production potential is of course worth our great attention. Fighting against natural disasters and expanding farmland water conservancy work must rely on the collective strength of organized farmers, but also on the planning of scientific institutions, the unified command of water conservancy departments, and the cooperation of meteorological units, etc. Therefore, comrades working in these areas should also be further mobilized to more actively support agricultural construction.

    Another important force in supporting agriculture is intellectuals. First of all, senior intellectuals should actively act from various fronts such as science, health, culture, and education, and strive to serve the development of agriculture and the needs of farmers. At the same time, the vast number of educated youth should become a direct new force in supporting agricultural production. Whether it is to improve the technical level of agriculture, to fight against nature, or to strengthen the management of agricultural cooperatives, scientific knowledge will be increasingly needed in the future. The older generation of farmers have rich production experience and a fine tradition of diligence, but they lack scientific knowledge, so they face many difficulties in large-scale modern agricultural production. Let us read the joint speech of labor models Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, Wu Chun'an, Qu Yaoli, and Shen Jilan at the National People's Congress meeting in July this year, and we can see how urgently the rural areas welcome educated youth. They said: Agricultural production after cooperation is different from the small-scale peasant economy in the past. Now there is collective large-scale production with thousands or tens of thousands of mu of land, hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousands of laborers, and a large number of livestock and new agricultural tools. Without cultural and scientific knowledge, you will feel difficulty everywhere. For example, the production of advanced cooperatives must have a plan. To make a plan, you must have detailed statistics on the quality of the land, the level of yield, and the strength of labor and animal power, and you must arrange technical measures appropriately. Can this set of meticulous and complex work be done without cultural and scientific knowledge? Furthermore, there is the distribution issue. The members work hard for a year, and what they care most about is the distribution of the fruits of their labor. If the distribution is not timely or unreasonable, it will affect the production enthusiasm of the members and the development and consolidation of agriculture. Therefore, a distribution plan must be prepared in advance. This involves both statistical work and calculation work. It is also difficult to do these things well without cultural and scientific knowledge. In terms of agricultural technology, intercropping, replanting, close planting, seed soaking and seed dressing of various crops, the preparation of insecticides, and the use of new agricultural tools and water lifting tools all require laborers with cultural and scientific knowledge to master. In addition, the work in culture, medicine, and health all requires educated youth. Since there are so many jobs in rural areas that urgently need people to do, can we sit idly by? Therefore, the cultural, educational, and health departments must shoulder the task in this regard, on the one hand, mobilizing the existing educated youth to go to the countryside, and on the other hand, continuing to train a large number of young intellectuals who understand basic agricultural knowledge, love agricultural production, and have been tempered by productive labor, and who are willing to serve the construction of a new countryside for life.

    Improving financial and trade work and better serving agricultural production is also an indispensable support for agriculture. This includes better playing the effect of state investment, further studying the prices of agricultural products and improving the procurement work, and striving to supply farmers with production and living materials, etc. According to the preliminary plan for 1958, the total amount of state investment in basic construction for agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, agricultural loans and disaster relief appropriations will be nearly 3 billion yuan. Adding the accumulation of cooperatives, the total amount of agricultural investment for the whole year will be even greater. How to help farmers use this fund in places where the economic effect of investment can be fully exerted is naturally a problem that financial and monetary units need to study and solve well. As for the procurement of agricultural products, in recent years, generally correct price policies have been implemented, and the policy of supporting agricultural development has been implemented, which has played a significant role in developing production and improving living standards. Adding up the figures during the First Five-Year Plan period, the price index for agricultural products increased by 21%, and farmers gained a net profit of 10.6 billion yuan due to the price increase of agricultural products, of which 6.5 billion yuan came from state procurement, which is equal to about 40% of the total agricultural tax during the First Five-Year Plan period. However, there are still many agricultural product prices that are not completely reasonable, and there are still serious shortcomings in the procurement work; in remote areas, there are still many agricultural and sideline products that no one buys, which affects the enthusiasm of local farmers to develop production. How to improve the procurement of agricultural products is the common task of grain departments, procurement departments, and staff of entrusted procurement units. With the development of agricultural production and the increase in farmers' economic income, farmers' consumption levels are also increasing day by day. During the First Five-Year Plan period, farmers' total income increased by about 30%, and due to the increase in population, the average consumption level per capita increased by about 20%. Rationally supplying and meeting the growing consumption needs of farmers is another arduous task that commercial departments must shoulder.

    In order to do these tasks well, the state's design, transportation, postal and telecommunications and other departments also need to be mobilized to give agriculture huge support.

    In addition to material and financial resources, more importantly, it is also necessary to mobilize a group of cadres to strengthen the agricultural front. This requires taking extensive organizational measures nationwide and transferring a large number of cadres to the countryside. This method is not unfamiliar to us. At the beginning of liberation, in order to completely defeat the rural feudal forces, tens of thousands of cadres went to the countryside at that time. They led and helped the farmers to complete a great land reform movement, and many cadres also gained experience in the struggle. When the country turned to a period of planned construction and industrial development, tens of thousands of cadres were transferred to the industrial front. They relied closely on and led the vast number of workers and staff around the hot blast furnaces, in the noisy machine rooms, in the snow-covered wilderness, and on the turbulent rivers, and built thousands of factories and mines, greatly improving China's industrial production, and laid the preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization in a short period of several years. Today, when the task of further developing agriculture is placed before the people of the whole country, when the country needs to send more cadres to strengthen the agricultural front, is there any reason not to adopt these effective experiences and methods? Every cadre who is assigned to the countryside should resolutely obey the needs of the great socialist construction, roll up their bedding, put on straw sandals, leave the city, go to the countryside, and go to the glorious agricultural production front! Strengthen the leadership and working forces on the agricultural front!

    大家都来支援农业
    在全民讨论1956年到1967年的全国农业发展纲要的修正草案的时候，除了农民群众和农村工作人员以外，其他各界人民为什么也应当积极地参加这场讨论呢？因为必须把全国各方面的力量动员起来，支援农业。
    我们的党和政府从来没有放松农业，不仅农民群众用全力积极发展农业生产，党和国家都花了巨大力量领导发展农业。几年来的农业生产大大地超过了旧中国的水平，保证了国家和人民的基本需要，避免了工农业脱节的危险。但是，由于我国农业原有的基础过于落后，解放以来对粮棉油料作物等的需要又增长很快，因此农业生产的发展至今仍然远远地赶不上需要的增长的速度。为了保证六亿人民的吃穿，同时也为了进一步保证和推动工业的发展，今后必须从各方面努力发展农业。毛主席指示我们：“在第二个五年计划和第三个五年计划期间，如果我们的农业能够有更大的发展，使轻工业相应地有更多的发展，这对于整个国民经济会有好处。农业和轻工业发展了，重工业有了市场，有了资金，它就会更快地发展。”
    本报10月14、15日发表的中共浙江省委给中共中央的报告，曾经有力地说明了加强各方面工作同农业生产协作的重要性。这个报告中指出：工业部门如果能供应插秧机和收割机，就可以大大节约劳动力和增加复种面积；每个合作社如果有一架万能吸风锤研机，就可充分利用谷物茎秆，保证每户养猪四头的饲料。又如：1956年投资六十二万元开辟了一百多公里的林道和河道，就增产了五十六万立方公尺的木材，国家和农户共得一千几百万元的好处。这些例子充分地说明了一个真理，这就是社会主义经济是一个整体，农业如果离开其它方面的援助，就不可能得到更大的发展。同样，工业、商业、手工业、交通运输业也不可能离开农业而单独地发展起来。因此，在实现这个纲要的过程中，最主要的依靠虽然是农民自己的力量，但是同时，无论工矿交通企业、财政贸易和供销合作单位、科学文教系统也都要承担一定的任务，都有很多很多必须做好的工作。
    发展农业首先需要工业的支援。工业必须为农业生产更多的化学肥料、农业机器、杀虫药剂、医药用品和生活资料。这是发展农业生产和改善农民生活的一个基本条件。就使用化学肥料而论，日本是使用化肥数量较多的一个国家，1955年平均每亩地施肥一百二十三点三斤，粮食产量平均每亩四百零八斤，为世界高产量国家之一。根据我国农村使用化肥的情况，每斤氮肥能增产水稻三至五斤，小麦二至三斤，籽棉一斤多；每斤磷肥能增产粮食一斤半，籽棉半斤。我国使用化肥时间最久最多的广东潮汕地区和山东莱阳地区产量也很高。前者每亩水稻常年产量为一千斤，后者每亩小麦常年产量为五百斤。但是从全国来看，由于技术落后和肥料不足（现在我国平均每亩地只有一点四四斤化肥），全国粮食平均产量，1955年即提出和开始实行全国农业发展纲要草案的前一年，每亩只有一百九十七斤，大大落后于我国的最高产量。所以，为了提高我国单位面积的产量，除了争取其他必要的措施以外，在目前还必须大大增加化学肥料的生产和供应，以补畜肥和自然肥料的不足。再就使用农业机器而论，农业合作化以后，农村劳动力并不像有些人曾经想像的那样大有剩余。由于复种面积扩大，水利工程增加，耕作愈来愈细致，副业愈来愈多样，人力和畜力的需要量大大增加了，因而使用机器来代替人力畜力的要求也就越来越迫切。农村的某些规模较大的基本建设工程，有些也需要机械力量的支援。因此，制造各种适合需要的农业机械，供应农民，是进一步发展农业生产的重要条件。此外，在提高农业生产技术、在扑灭病虫害、在满足农民的物质和文化生活等等方面，需要工业支援的地方还很多很多。这些都是全体工人阶级的义务。我国的工人阶级和工矿企业是一定要从各方面给农业建设和农民兄弟以巨大援助的。
    要发展农业就需要同自然进行严重的斗争，防止自然的灾害，利用自然的条件。这又要求科学机关、水利部门、气象单位等等进行巨大的援助。目前在我国迫切需要解决的是减轻水旱涝灾和扩大灌溉面积，争取一方面保产，一方面增产。根据八年来的经验，我国在淮河以北地区，水灾多于旱灾，涝灾又多于水灾。河北、山东、河南、安徽、江苏五省，平均每年即有五千万亩到一亿亩低洼地受涝，每年少收一、二百亿斤粮食。从1953年到1956年，全国遭受自然灾害的耕地面积约七亿七千万亩，平均每年为一亿九千万亩，因灾损失的粮食平均每年一百八十七亿斤，棉花二百万担。如果把这些可能收到的粮棉都拿到手，就是巨大的增产！我们要努力驯服自然，使它给我们更多的粮食，而不能让灾害每年从我们的土地上白白地夺去大批食粮。而利用自然的一个重要方面，就是努力扩大灌溉面积。这一方面可以疏畅水涝，一方面可以加强抗旱能力，从而增加产量。目前我国灌溉面积仅占耕地的30％，这个比例是很低的。根据我国生产的经验，旱地改为水田，再加上必要的肥料和耕作技术的改进，每亩平均可增产一倍或更多。只要我们能够先改变二亿亩地为水田，每年就能增产好几百亿斤粮食。这样巨大的生产潜力，当然值得我们十分重视。对自然灾害进行斗争和扩大农田水利工作，要依靠组织起来的农民的集体力量，但是也要依靠科学机关的规划，水利部门的统一指挥，气象单位等等的协作。因此，在这些方面工作的同志，也应该进一步地动员起来，更积极地支援农业建设。
    支援农业的另一个重要力量是知识分子。首先是高级知识分子应该从科学、卫生、文化、教育等各个战线上积极行动起来，努力为发展农业而服务，为农民群众的需要而服务。同时广大的知识青年更应该成为支援农业生产的直接生力军。无论是提高农业的技术水平也好，同自然进行斗争也好，加强农业社的经营管理工作也好，今后都愈来愈需要科学知识。老一代的农民，他们有丰富的生产经验，有勤劳的优良传统，但是他们缺乏科学知识，因而在大规模的现代化的农业生产中面临着很多困难。让我们读一读劳动模范李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安、曲耀离和申纪兰今年七月在全国人民代表大会会议上的联合发言，就可以看到农村目前是如何迫切地欢迎知识青年了。他们说：合作化以后的农业生产，和过去的小农经济不同了。现在是有几千几万亩土地、几百几千甚至上万个劳动力、有大批牲口和新式农具的集体大生产，如果没有文化科学知识，处处都会感到困难。比如，高级社的生产要有计划，订计划就要对土地好坏、产量高低、劳力和畜力的强弱有详尽的统计，对技术措施要安排适当。这一套细致复杂的工作，没有文化科学知识能行吗？再说分配问题。社员辛苦劳动一年，最关心的是劳动成果的分配。分配不及时或者不合理，就会影响社员的生产情绪和农业的发展和巩固。因此，必须事先作好分配方案。这里既有统计工作，又有计算工作，没有文化科学知识也很难把这些办好。在农业技术方面，各种作物的间作、复播、密植、浸种拌种，杀虫药剂的配制，新式农具和提水工具的使用，都需要有文化科学知识的劳动者来掌握。此外，在文化、医药、卫生各方面的工作，也都需要知识青年。农村既然有这样多的工作急待人去做，难道我们能坐视不理吗？因此，文化、教育、卫生部门必须担负起这方面的任务，一方面动员现有的知识青年到农村去，一方面继续培养大批懂得农业基本知识、热爱农业生产、经过生产劳动的锻炼，自愿为建设新的农村而终身服务的青年知识分子。
    改进财政贸易工作，更好地为农业生产服务，这也是对农业的不可缺少的支援。这里包括更好地发挥国家投资效果，进一步研究农产品价格和改进收购工作，努力供应农民生产和生活资料等等方面。按照1958年的初步计划，国家发展农林水利的基本建设投资、农业贷款和救灾拨款总数将近三十亿元，加上合作社的积累，全年农业投资总数就更大得多了。怎样帮助农民把这一基金用在最能充分地发挥投资的经济效果的地方，自然是财政金融单位需要很好研究和解决的问题。至于农产品的收购工作，几年来，一般地执行了正确的价格政策，贯彻了扶助农业发展的方针，对发展生产和改善生活方面都起了显著作用。把第一个五年计划期间的数字合计起来，农产品采购价格指标提高了21％，农民由于农产品提价净得利益一百零六亿元，其中来自国家收购的为六十五亿元，等于第一个五年计划期间农业税总额的40％左右。但是，也还有不少的农产品价格不尽合理，收购工作还有严重缺点；在偏僻的地方，还有许多农副业产品无人收购，影响当地农民发展生产的积极性。怎样改进农产品的收购工作，这是粮食部门、采购部门和委托收购单位工作人员的共同任务。随着农业生产的发展和农民经济收入的增加，农民消费水平也日益提高了。第一个五年计划期间农民总收入增长了30％左右，由于人口的增加，按人口平均的消费水平约提高了20％。合理地供应和满足农民日益增长的消费需要，这又是商业部门必须担负的繁重工作。
    为了作好这些工作，国家的设计、交通、邮电等等部门也需要动员起来，给农业以巨大的支援。
    除了物力财力而外，更重要的是还需要动员一批干部去加强农业战线。这就要求在全国范围内采取广泛的组织措施，抽调大批干部到农村去。这种办法对我们说来并不是陌生的。在解放之初，为了彻底打垮农村封建势力，当时成千上万的干部到了农村，他们领导和帮助农民完成了一项伟大的土地改革运动，很多干部自己也在斗争中得到了锻炼。当国家转入有计划的建设和发展工业的时期，又有成千上万的干部转到工业战线上去，他们在火热的高炉旁边、在喧腾的机器房里、在冰天雪地的荒野里、在水流湍急的江河上，紧紧依靠和领导广大职工，建设了成千的工厂矿山，把我国工业生产大大地提高了一步，在短短的几年中，奠定了社会主义工业化的初步基础。今天，当着进一步发展农业的任务摆在全国人民面前的时候，当国家需要派遣更多干部去加强农业战线的时候，有什么理由不采用这些有效的经验和办法呢？每一个被分配到农村去的干部，都应该坚决服从伟大的社会主义建设的需要，卷起被窝，穿上草鞋，离开城市，到农村去，到光荣的农业生产战线上去！加强农业战线上的领导和工作力量！
