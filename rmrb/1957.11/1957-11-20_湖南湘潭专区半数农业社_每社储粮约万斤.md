Hunan's Xiangtan Prefecture: Half of Agricultural Cooperatives Store Approximately 10,000 Jin of Grain Per Cooperative

    (Reported by this newspaper) As of the end of October, Hunan Province had already seen two thousand agricultural cooperatives storing a total of over 140 million jin of reserve grain. In Xiangtan Prefecture, over half of the agricultural cooperatives had each stored an average of about 10,000 jin of reserve grain. Many other agricultural cooperatives had also drafted grain reserve plans and were waiting to collect the late rice harvest before proceeding with accumulation.

    Since the autumn harvest distribution, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly instructed various localities to attach importance to and do a good job in grain reserve work. In the course of carrying out the major debate focusing on grain issues, all localities have emphasized propaganda and debate in this regard. The Linyi County Workers' Agricultural Cooperative, which increased its production by 36% compared to the "Three Fixes" target, initially encountered resistance from cooperative cadres and members towards storing reserve grain. After discussion, the cooperative committee publicized the principles of storing reserve grain: first, storing reserve grain is "using surplus to compensate for deficiency, storing grain to prevent famine," only setting aside a portion from the surplus production, which will not affect the members' food rations; second, the reserve grain is collectively owned by the members, managed by the cooperative, and its disposal is subject to the cooperative's decision; third, the reserve grain will only be used in the event of special disasters and will not be used for supplementary sales, to ensure expanded accumulation. The members unanimously agreed that this method was very good and decided to store 100,000 jin of grain, accounting for 20% of the surplus production, and decided to accumulate enough grain within four years to feed all cooperative members for half a year. The Yueyang Xiyou Agricultural Cooperative's committee also calculated such an account for the members: if the cooperative stores 19,500 jin of reserve grain, the actual grain retention level per member can still reach 522 jin, which is 18 jin more than the "Three Fixes" grain retention level; if no reserve grain is stored, each member may gain about 10 jin more grain, which is not of great benefit to individuals. In addition, this cooperative can distribute cash of one yuan and six fen per labor day in addition to the reserve grain, which still exceeds last year, thereby resolving the members' ideological concerns.

    Because many localities have conscientiously carried out propaganda and debate, and resolved various ideological problems of the members, not only have they collected reserve grain in cooperatives with bumper harvests and increased production, but also in many cooperatives with average harvests, the members have automatically taken out a few jin of grain from their rations to be used as reserve grain. The members reflected: "The old saying goes: 'Think of days without when you have them.' If we each eat a small pinch less rice every day, the cooperative can concentrate it and do great things."

### 湖南湘潭专区半数农业社  每社储粮约万斤

    湖南湘潭专区半数农业社
    每社储粮约万斤
    本报讯　到10月底止，湖南省已经有两万个农业社，留储备粮一亿四千多万斤。其中湘潭专区即有过半数以上的农业社，平均每社留下约一万斤储备粮，还有许多农业社订好了粮食储备计划，等待晚稻收割后即行筹集。
    今年秋收分配以来，中共湖南省委曾经多次指示各地重视和做好粮食储备工作，各地在开展以粮食问题为主的大辩论中，都着重地进行了这方面的宣传和辩论。临湘县职工农业社，今年比“三定”定的产量增产36％，开始社干部与社员对留储备粮有抵触思想，经过讨论社委会宣传的留储备粮原则：一是留储备粮是“以丰补歉，积谷防荒”，只在超产粮内留一部分，不会影响社员口粮；二是储备粮为社员共同所有，由社保管，处理权属于社；三是储备粮只在遇到特殊灾害时动用，不作补销，以保证扩大积累。社员们一致认为这个办法很好，决定储备粮食十万斤，占超产粮的20％，并决定四年内积累够全社社员半年食用的粮食。岳阳西游农业社社委会还向社员算了一笔这样的账：全社如留储备粮一万九千五百斤，每个社员实际留粮水平仍可达五百二十二斤，比“三定”留粮水平还多十八斤；如不留储备粮，每个社员也可能多得粮食约十斤，对个人好处并不大。另外，这个社除储备粮外，每个劳动日还可分现金一元零六分，仍然超过去年，因而打通了社员的思想。
    由于许多地方认真地进行了宣传辩论，解决了社员的各种思想问题，不仅在丰收增产的社里筹集了储备粮，同时在许多平收社里，社员们也自动地从口粮中抽出几斤粮食留作储备粮。社员们反映：“古语说：要将有日思无日，我们每人每天少吃一撮米，社里面集中起来就可以办大事情。”
