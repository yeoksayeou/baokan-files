    An Extraordinary Life
    — Sights and Sounds in Hungary
    Wang Qi

    The nightmare of October is over. The morning in Budapest is bathed in brilliant sunshine. The Danube River awakens, countless newly awakened eyes twinkling, golden ripples shimmering on the water. The great bridges spanning the Danube carry the people of Budapest into their new, bustling lives day and night.

    The son of a Hungarian people's hero, Mező Imre, had his heart pierced by a counter-revolutionary bullet while it was beating for the fate of millions. He fell at his post, in front of the Budapest Municipal Party Committee building. His blood flowed out, he sacrificed himself for the glorious cause, and his personal life came to an end with it. But the people will advance, treading in his bloodstained footsteps. Mező Imre foresaw all of this. As he lay dying, he told his wife, as if telling her something to do before going to sleep, "Our cause will continue, please take care of Comrade Kádár!"

    When I visited Mező Imre's widow, she told me this, and said, "Young Pioneers write to me, wanting me to be their mother; old women want me to put the paper flowers they made themselves on Mező's grave; little girls send me headscarves. ... I know and understand what they mean, they love Mező!" She also told me this story: Once, she went to the countryside, and people asked her to tell Kádár, "With us here, Mező Imre's cause will continue. We will forever defend the people's democratic system."

    Many Communist Party members and working people have sacrificed themselves. But the path opened with blood will not be forgotten by the people.

    In January of this year, a fierce battle took place on Csepel Island. At that time, the counter-revolutionary forces were very strong in the Iron and Steel Works. The factory Party committee worked non-stop, fighting, in their words, "with talk". Leading comrades of the Party and government also frequently went deep into the factory to talk with the workers and conduct ideological education work. Now, this steel factory, which employs more than 20,000 people, is producing at almost the same level as before the October events. However, there is still a small group of workers who are still influenced by counter-revolutionary ideas and long for the "lazy man policy" - getting paid without working.

    One day, news spread throughout the factory: "One person, Marosán, 'strolled' from the factory gate all the way to our machines." The next day, Marosán spoke to more than 10,000 workers in the factory. He frankly told the workers everything he had seen the day before, both good and bad. Finally, he asked everyone: "In the past, we couldn't tolerate lax labor discipline, why can we tolerate it now?" The day after Marosán spoke with the workers at the Csepel factory, some technicians asked the workers to observe labor discipline. In a machine factory within this combined plant, many workers suggested, "Whoever doesn't work should be kicked out of the factory!" The chaos created by the counter-revolutionaries in this factory was a complete failure.

    In the suburb of Budapest, in the village of Nagykőbánya, there is a Dawn Agricultural Cooperative. This cooperative was broken up and then reorganized. The chairman of the cooperative used to be a brave member of the Public Security Forces. His name is Gucsi János. We found him in the wheat fields. It was the harvest season. The cooperative's twenty-odd male and female members were scattered on the hillside, rows of wheat stalks falling beside them. This young chairman told me that after he escaped from the counter-revolutionaries' prison, he began to look for those former poor peasant members. The first person he found was an old poor peasant of more than thirty years, his father-in-law, Kish Lajos, who was both happy and afraid for his son-in-law. During the day, the counter-revolutionaries did not dare to act openly, but at night they brought weapons, knocked on Kish's windows, and threatened him to quickly hand over his son-in-law, who was in the Public Security Forces. Kish and his wife spent countless nights of trembling sleeplessness, the son-in-law in the Public Security Forces could not be handed over! Gucsi hid here today, there tomorrow, and kept organizing the peasants one by one. Even though he was working hard, he still had a thought hidden in his heart. He seemed afraid of being heard, and whispered to us:

    "As long as the Party says the word, and lets me be in the Public Security Forces, I'll leave immediately! Being a chairman is also revolution, but it's not as satisfying as defending the Party with weapons." He glanced at his father-in-law, who was leading a group of people to cut wheat. Kish, whether he heard it or not, said loudly: "No matter what, don't forget that we are poor peasants!"

    When we arrived at Mount Pasarét and stopped in front of a house, we heard beautiful piano music. The door opened, and Magas Mária, wearing casual clothes, ran down the hillside. While leading us to her house on the hillside, she asked me, "Are you interested in this little garden that I cultivated myself?" Without waiting for me to answer, she continued, "It's just that the road is not easy to walk, I want to practice my ability to walk on mountain roads."

    Magas Mária is one of the most popular opera singers in Hungary's "La Traviata". In those days of October, because her husband, an engineer, was a Communist Party member, she could not go to her beloved piano. The counter-revolutionaries were looking for them every day, and she had to avoid their search. After November 4, when there were still gunshots in Budapest, she stepped onto the stage and opened her golden voice, telling the people of Budapest: a new life has begun. She will soon be going abroad to perform. She told me how unwilling she was to leave her country at this time! She wanted to sing every day and meet with the audience every day. She said she had never loved her country so much as she does now.

    The October counter-revolutionary event destroyed 18,669 homes and also damaged many buildings. The Budapest People's Government mobilized more than 6,000 people and used more than 533 million forints (Hungarian currency) to carry out restoration work in the face of a shortage of raw materials and technical personnel. Within three or four months, 56.2% of the damaged buildings and 75% of the residences were repaired. Even though the restoration work was proceeding so quickly, some people still had no place to live at the beginning. The Budapest Municipal People's Government vacated some office buildings for residents to move in.

    The victorious people are always full of optimism about the past, present, and future, no matter how difficult it may be. The Vice-Chairman of the Budapest Municipal People's Government, Bárdos István, also has this quality. When he talked to us about the restoration work, he said very optimistically:

    "The counter-revolutionaries have done us a 'good' thing! Otherwise, Budapest would not have changed its appearance so quickly." Then he told us about the new changes in the city appearance of Budapest, and some plans that are about to be realized: The Gervinus Cinema, which was the barracks of the counter-revolutionaries during the October events, was completely destroyed. We have turned it into a more beautiful wide-screen cinema. There used to be a large clothing store on Rákóczi Street, which will be moved elsewhere. The destroyed clothing store will be turned into a street park. He said, "You know, the Danube River is the pride in the hearts of us Budapest people, we should let the people see the Danube River when they walk on the street. There are some streets that we don't want to restore as they were originally, like the People's Republic Avenue, we want to let it go all the way to the Danube River!"

    The vigorous life I have seen is so ordinary and so great! People are working hard, and at the same time feel glorious and proud. Who created such a bright and great life? Without the Socialist Workers' Party, if the position of Chairman of the Council of Ministers was not held by Kádár, who represents the workers' and peasants' revolutionary government, but by Imre Nagy, what would Hungary be like now, what would Budapest be like now? Every Hungarian would answer this question.

    不平凡的生活
    ——在匈牙利的见闻
    汪琦
    10月的恶梦，已经过去了。布达佩斯的早晨，太阳灿烂地照耀着。多瑙河醒来了，无数只初醒的眼睛在闪灼，水上泛起了金色的微波。横跨多瑙河的大桥，日日夜夜地把布达佩斯人带进那新的沸腾的生活。
    匈牙利人民英雄的儿子——麦泽·伊姆莱，正当他的心脏为着千百万人的命运而跳动的时候，一颗反革命的毒弹，射穿了他的心。他在他的岗位上，在布达佩斯市委大楼门前倒下了，他的血流尽了，他为了光荣的事业而牺牲了，他的个人的生活也随之而结束，但是，人民将踏着他的血迹前进。麦泽·伊姆莱预见了这一切。他临死的时候，如同睡觉以前把一件明天要做的事告诉他的妻子：“我们的事业会继续下去，请卡达尔同志保重！”
    在我访问麦泽·伊姆莱夫人的时候，她告诉了我这些，并说：“少先队员们给我来信，要我做他们的妈妈，老太太要我把她亲手做的纸花放在麦泽的坟上，小姑娘送我头巾。……我知道和懂得他们的意思，他们爱麦泽！”她又告诉我这样一件事：有一次，她到了乡村，人们要她转告卡达尔说：“有我们在这里，麦泽·伊姆莱的事业会继续下去的。我们永远保卫着人民民主制度。”
    许多共产党员、劳动人民牺牲了。但是，那用鲜血开辟的道路，人们是不会忘记的。
    今年1月，在切佩尔岛上，曾发生一场激烈的战斗。那时，钢铁联合工厂反革命力量很大。工厂党委一刻不停地工作，用他们的话来说，
  “用说话作斗争”。党和政府的负责人，也经常深入到工厂，和工人谈话，进行思想教育工作。现在，这个拥有两万多人的钢铁工厂，生产快接近十月事件以前的水平。但是，还有一小部分工人，依然受反革命思想影响，在那里想念“懒人政策”——只拿工资，不做工。
    有一天，工厂里传遍了一个消息：“马罗山一个人从工厂门口，一直‘散步’到我们的机器旁边。”第二天，马罗山对全厂一万多工人谈话。他坦率地把他头一天所看到的好的和坏的事，都对工人说了。最后，他问大家：“过去不能容忍劳动纪律松懈的现象，为什么现在就能容忍了呢？”在马罗山和切佩尔工厂工人谈话后第二天，有的技术人员，要求工人遵守劳动纪律。在这个联合工厂的一个机器工厂里，许多工人建议：“谁不劳动，就把他撵出工厂去！”反革命分子在这个工厂所制造的混乱，彻底失败了。
    布达佩斯郊区纳吉哥巴奇村，有一个曙光农业合作社。这个合作社是拆散后又重新组织起来的。合作社的主席，过去是一个勇敢的公安军人员。他名叫顾切尔·亚诺什。我们在麦地里找到了他。正是收割的季节。合作社二十几户男女社员，都散布在山坡上，麦棵在他们的身旁一排排地倒下来。这位年轻的主席告诉我说，当他从反革命的监狱逃回来以后，就开始找那些过去的贫农社员。第一个他找的是三十多年的老贫农，他的岳父——基什·劳约斯老人又高兴，又替他的女婿害怕。白天反革命分子不敢公开活动，黑夜他们带了武器，敲基什的窗户，威胁他，让他赶快把当公安军的女婿交出来。基什和他的妻子，不知度过了多少个战栗不眠的夜晚，公安军的女婿是不能交的！顾切尔今天这里躲一下，明天那里躲一下，还不停地一个、二个地组织农民。组织到了十户，成立了曙光合作社，现在扩大到二十几户。虽然他干得很起劲，可是，心里还藏着一个念头。他怕谁听见似的，靠近我们，悄悄地说：
    “只要党说一声，让我做公安军，我马上就走！做主席也是革命，可没有拿着武器保卫党痛快。”他又用眼瞧瞧旁边正带着一组人在割麦的老岳父。基什不知道是听见了，还是没有听见，他高声说：“不管怎么样，不会忘记我们是贫农！”
    当我们走到鲍肖雷特山上，在一家住宅门前停下的时候，我们听到了优美的琴声。门开了，马加斯·玛丽亚穿着家庭便服，从山坡上跑下来。她一面把我们引到山坡上她的房子里去，一面问我：“我自己培植的这个小花园，有兴趣吗？”不等我回答，她又接着说：“就是路不好走，我想锻炼走山路的本领呢。”
    马加斯·玛丽亚，是匈牙利演歌剧“茶花女”最受欢迎的女歌唱家之一，在十月那些日子里，因为她的当工程师的丈夫，是共产党员，她不能走到自己心爱的琴边。反革命分子天天在寻找他们，她不得不避开反革命分子的搜查。在11月4日以后，当布达佩斯还有枪声的时候，她就登上了戏台，亮开了她那金钟一样的歌喉，告诉布达佩斯的人们：新的生活又开始了。她马上又要出国表演。她告诉我：她多么不愿意在这个时候离开祖国！她很想每天歌唱，每天和观众见面。她说她从来没有像现在这样爱自己的国家。
    十月反革命事件，毁坏了一万八千六百六十九个家，还破坏了许多建筑物。布达佩斯人民政府动员了六千多人，使用了五亿三千三百多福林（匈币），在缺原料、缺技术人员的困境中进行恢复工作。在三、四个月内，56．2％遭受破坏的建筑和75％的住宅，都修复了。即便恢复工作进行这样快，开始也还有一些人没有房子住。布达佩斯市人民政府把一些办公大楼挪出来，让居民搬进去住。
    胜利了的人民，对于过去、现在和将来，不管多么困难，总是充满乐观情绪的。布达佩斯市人民政府副主席巴尔德许·伊斯特万，也有这种素质，他对我们谈到恢复工作的时候，非常乐观地说：
    “反革命分子对我们有‘好’处呢！否则布达佩斯不会这样快改变面目。”接着他告诉我们布达佩斯市容的新的变化，和一些即将实现的计划：格尔维尼电影院，十月事件中是反革命分子的兵营，完全被破坏了。我们把它改成了一座更漂亮的宽银幕的电影院了。拉科基大街上原来有一所很大的被服商店，要把它搬到别处去。破坏了的被服商店，将改成街道公园。他说：“你知道，多瑙河是我们布达佩斯人心中的骄傲，我们应当让人民走在大街上，就能看到多瑙河。有几条大街，我们不想照原样恢复了，像人民共和国大街，要让它一直通到多瑙河！”
    我所看到的这样朝气勃勃的生活，是这样平凡，又是这样伟大！人们艰苦地工作着，同时感到了光荣和骄傲。是谁创立了这样光明而伟大的生活呢？如果没有社会主义工人党，如果在部长会议主席的位子上，坐的不是代表工农革命政府的卡达尔，而是伊姆雷·纳吉，现在的匈牙利，现在的布达佩斯，会是什么样呢？每一个匈牙利人，都会回答这个问题的。
