Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 15th: The Soviet Union is capable of launching rockets to the Moon and Mars today, provided the rockets are unmanned. This was stated by the well-known Soviet scientist Sternfeld to the Moscow correspondent of the Polish "Warsaw Life" newspaper in early November.

Sternfeld said: The fact that the second Soviet artificial satellite weighs more than 500 kilograms is of great significance. This is not just a matter of increasing the number of instruments carried. This shows that if we can launch such heavy objects into outer space, then, under these circumstances, replacing the current artificial satellite with another stage rocket, and increasing the current speed of more than eight kilometers per second by another three kilometers per second, we can reach the moon. This is entirely possible. It's not a fantasy anymore.

Sternfeld also pointed out that the successful launch of the second Soviet artificial satellite shows that only a small step remains to fly to Mars, and this small step is almost no longer a problem. Because it is only necessary to increase the speed of the rocket by another 400 to 500 meters per second on the basis of flying to the moon. This is not something for tomorrow, but something that can be achieved today. The only remaining problem is hitting the target.

Sternfeld said that it would take a maximum of five days to get to the moon, and no more than eight months to get to Mars. If the initial velocity of the rocket is slightly increased, the time required can be shortened. At the same time, as long as the direction of the signals sent by the rockets flying to the Moon and Mars is always accurately facing the Earth, it can be guaranteed that these signals will be received on Earth. However, designing such automated and highly sensitive antennas is not easy. If the rocket carries people, many problems can be solved quickly.

Regarding the issue of humans participating in spaceflight, Sternfeld said that in terms of physiology, there are two problems that need to be solved: The first is the problem of a sudden increase in a person's weight when the rocket begins to launch; and the second is the problem of a person's weight disappearing after the rocket engine stops working. Regarding the first problem, the laboratory has proven that people can withstand it. There is currently no complete experience regarding the second problem. Soviet scientists recently successfully experimented with the physiological effects of a person losing weight within one minute and the physiological effects of animals losing weight within two minutes. Now, scientists are able to create artificial gravity that humans need during spaceflight. He also said that for science, it is enough for the dog installed in the second artificial satellite to live in the artificial satellite for only one day or a few hours. Of course, the longer it can live, the better.

### 苏联科学家斯特恩菲尔德说  苏联现在就能向月球火星发射火箭

    苏联科学家斯特恩菲尔德说
    苏联现在就能向月球火星发射火箭
    到月球最多只要五天到火星不超过八个月
    新华社华沙15日电　苏联今天就能够发射飞向月球和火星的火箭，如果火箭不带人的话。这是苏联著名科学家斯特恩菲尔德11月上旬对波兰“华沙生活报”驻莫斯科记者说的。
    斯特恩菲尔德说：苏联发射的第二个人造卫星重五百多公斤这一事实具有重大的意义。这不单单是携带的仪器数量增多的问题。这说明我们如果能够向宇宙空间发射出这样重的物体，那么，在这种情况下，以另一级火箭代替目前的人造卫星，在目前每秒八公里多的速度的基础上，再增加每秒三公里，便可以到达月球。这是完全可能的。不是什么幻想了。
    斯特恩菲尔德还指出，苏联第二个人造卫星的发射成功，说明飞向火星也只剩下一小步了，这一小步几乎已不成问题。因为只要使火箭的速度在飞向月球的基础上再增加每秒四百到五百公尺就足够了。这也不是明天，而是今天就能够实现的事情。现在遗留的问题只是命中目标的问题。
    斯特恩菲尔德说，到月球去最多只要五天，到火星去也不会超过八个月。如果使火箭的初速略微增加一些，需要的时间还可以缩短。同时，只要飞向月球和火星去的火箭发出的讯号的方向是经常准确地对着地球，那就可以保证在地球上收到这些讯号。但是，设计这样自动化而又十分敏锐的天线并非太容易的事。如果火箭上载得有人，那么，许多问题很快就能解决了。
    关于人参加宇宙飞行的问题，斯特恩菲尔德说，在生理学方面，有两个问题需要解决：第一是火箭开始发射时人的体重突然增加的问题；第二是火箭发动机停止工作后，人的体重消失的问题。关于第一个问题，实验室已经证明人是可以支持得住的。关于第二个问题目前尚无完整的经验。苏联科学家不久前曾经用人工方法成功地实验了人在一分钟内失去重量时发生的生理影响和动物在两分钟内失去重量时发生的生理影响。现在，科学家已经能够制造人在宇宙飞行时所需要的人造引力。他又说，对于科学来说，第二个人造卫星中装的狗只要在人造卫星中活上一天或几个小时就足够了。当然它能够活的越久越好。
