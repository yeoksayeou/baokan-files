Carrying out youth self-study activities through various methods.
Most of the primary and secondary school graduates in Beijing who did not go on to further education this year have participated in self-study organizations.
(Our newspaper reports) Since mid-September, the vast majority of primary and secondary school graduates in Beijing who did not go on to further education this year have participated in various self-study organizations and started self-study activities.

Attached remedial classes in existing primary and secondary schools are one of the main forms for primary and secondary school graduates in the city to conduct self-study. Primary schools have set up more than 100 remedial classes for primary school graduates, with more than 2,000 students; secondary schools have set up 76 remedial classes for secondary school graduates, with 3,774 students. According to the students' requirements, primary school remedial classes offer two courses, Chinese and arithmetic, and hold a weekly meeting once a week. The content of the weekly meeting includes explaining current affairs policies and making ideological and moral talks. Junior high school remedial classes offer courses such as politics, Chinese, and mathematics (including geometry and algebra) (some schools also add common sense of agricultural technology courses). Although the class time and number of classes in each remedial class are different, the teaching is mostly conducted by teachers providing classroom guidance, with organizing students' self-study activities as the main method. In order to strengthen the leadership of self-study, many remedial classes have established class committees, and some schools have also generally established self-study groups according to the students' living conditions. For younger primary school graduates, each group also hires parents as tutors.

Those primary and secondary school graduates who cannot attend remedial classes (mostly due to economic difficulties in the urban area, and because villages are scattered in the suburbs) establish self-study groups and hire high school graduates who did not go on to further education as tutors to help solve the difficulties encountered in learning. The students also give the tutors a certain amount of material reward.

The "Beijing Youth Self-Study Tutoring Radio Lectures" held by the Beijing Education Bureau and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station is also a good way to organize youth self-study. More than 2,000 people have participated in listening. People with radios can listen and study at home, and people without radios can go to neighbors or cultural centers to listen and study.

Primary and secondary school graduates who have already participated in agricultural production, handicraft production, and other service industries in the suburbs have either entered spare-time schools or have organized and are organizing self-study groups. In addition to organizing primary and secondary school graduates participating in the labor of the Fanjia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Huangtugang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District to participate in the rural socialist debate, they are planning to combine the winter production campaign after the autumn harvest and autumn planting to create spare-time schools and establish various self-study organizations such as classes and groups for them.

    通过各种方式开展青年自学活动
    北京市今年没有升学的中小学毕业生基本上都参加了自学组织
    本报讯　自9月中旬以来，今年北京市没有升学的中小学毕业生，绝大部分人都参加了各种自学组织，展开自学活动。
    在现有中小学校附设补习班，这是全市中小学毕业生进行自学的主要形式之一。各小学校为小学毕业生举办的补习班达一百多个班，计二千多人；各中学校为中学毕业生举办的补习班达七十六个班，计三千七百七十四人。根据学生的要求，小学补习班开设语文、算术两门课程，每周开一次周会。周会的内容包括讲解时事政策和做思想品德谈话。初中补习班开设政治、语文、数学（包括几何、代数）等课程（有一部分学校还增设农业技术常识课程）。各补习班上课的时间和节数虽然不同，但教学多是由教师进行课堂辅导，以组织学生自学活动为主要方式。为了加强对自学的领导，许多补习班都建立了班委会，有些学校根据学生的居住情况，还普遍建立了自学小组，对年龄较小的小学毕业生，各小组还聘请家长担任辅导员。
    凡是不能参加补习班的中小学毕业生（在城区多半因为经济困难，在郊区因为村庄分散），他们即建立自学小组，聘请没有升学的高初中毕业生做辅导教师，帮助解决学习中所遇到的困难问题。同学们也给予辅导教师以一定的物质报酬。
    由北京市教育局和北京市人民广播电台所举办的“北京青年自学辅导广播讲座”，也是组织青年自学的一种很好的形式。现已有二千多人参加收听。有收音机的人可以在家收听学习，没有收音机的人，可以到邻家或是文化馆去收听学习。
    已经参加郊区农业生产、手工业生产和其他服务性行业劳动的中小学毕业生，有的进了业余学校，有的已经组织和正在组织自学小组。丰台区樊家村农业生产合作社和黄土岗农业生产合作社，除组织参加该社劳动的中小学毕业生投入农村社会主义大辩论以外，正计划于秋收秋种结束后，结合冬季大生产运动，为他们创办业余学校和建立班、组等各种自学的组织。（附图片）
