The Laotian people's aspiration for the peaceful unification of their motherland is about to be realized! This is the greatest blessing for the Laotian people. The joint statement issued on November 2nd by Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, and Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, provides a guarantee for the Kingdom of Laos to move forward on the path of peace, independence, unity, and prosperity, and opens a new chapter in the history of the Laotian people's lives!

In their joint statement, Prince Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong agreed to form a coalition government with representatives of the Lao Fighting Units by expanding the government of the Kingdom of Laos, and agreed to use the current government's program proposed by Prince Phouma on August 9th of this year as the political program of the coalition government. Both sides agreed that the Lao Patriotic Front is a legitimate political organization and enjoys the same rights and obligations as other political parties in the Kingdom of Laos. The two sides agreed to establish Kingdom administrative institutions in the provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua, and the Kingdom government guaranteed to incorporate the Lao Fighting Units into the national army. Although the specific implementation of these principled agreements on major issues awaits further consultation between the two sides, this has already laid a reliable cornerstone for the peaceful unification of Laos.

The Laotian people have made long-term efforts to achieve the peaceful unification of their motherland. In accordance with the Geneva Accords, after the ceasefire in Laos in August 1954, the Kingdom of Laos government and the Lao Fighting Units began direct contact to seek the unification of the motherland. Over the long period of more than three years, the two sides conducted many consultations and encountered many difficulties and setbacks, especially the interference and sabotage by US imperialism and its agents, which prevented the Laotian people's desire for peaceful unification of their motherland from being realized quickly. However, the peaceful unification of their own country is the unwavering demand of all the Laotian people. This time, thanks to the efforts of both sides, an agreement on the establishment of a coalition government was finally reached. This shows that the Laotian people's will to strive for the peaceful unification of their motherland cannot be stopped by any force.

According to the agreement reached by both sides, the Kingdom of Laos coalition government to be established will use the policy program proposed by Prince Phouma on August 9th this year as its political program, which is of great significance. At that time, Prince Phouma assured the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Laos that, in terms of domestic policy, the first and most urgent task was to realize the unification of the Kingdom of Laos, and guaranteed that the Kingdom government would strictly and faithfully abide by the agreements it had signed with the Lao Fighting Units, especially the agreement on the establishment of a coalition government; in terms of foreign policy, it would pursue a policy of peace and neutrality and abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. If these political programs can be fully implemented, it will undoubtedly further strengthen the national unity of the Kingdom of Laos and further consolidate national independence, thus providing the Laotian people with greater guarantees for peaceful construction; at the same time, this will also have a beneficial impact on strengthening the friendly cooperation between Laos and Asian countries, especially its neighbors, and on promoting peace in Asia and Africa.

However, the imperialist countries, which harbor aggressive ambitions towards the Kingdom of Laos and are trying to create tension in Southeast Asia, are unwilling to see the peaceful unification of the Kingdom of Laos realized. They are continuing to carry out interference and sabotage activities, attempting to influence the peaceful development of the Laotian political situation. The British "Manchester Guardian" revealed that the United States is "concerned" about the situation in Laos. Therefore, the Laotian people still need to be vigilant and guard against foreign interference conspiracies.

The Chinese and Laotian peoples are close neighbors, and the friendship between our two countries has developed greatly in recent years. We sincerely hope that the peaceful unification of the Kingdom of Laos will be realized quickly and that it will move forward smoothly on the road of independent development.

    老挝王国实现和平统一的基石
    本报评论员
    老挝人民和平统一祖国的愿望，眼看就要实现了！这是老挝人民最大的福音。老挝王国政府首相富马亲王和寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王11月2日发表的联合声明，提供了老挝王国循着和平、独立、统一和繁荣的道路前进的保证，给老挝人民揭开了新生活历史的篇页！
    富马亲王和苏发努冯亲王在他们的联合声明中，同意用扩大老挝王国政府的办法成立有寮国战斗部队代表参加的联合政府，并且同意以富马亲王在今年8月9日所提出的现届王国政府的执政纲领作为联合政府的政治纲领。双方一致认为，老挝爱国战线是一个合法的政治性组织，它同老挝王国的其它政党一样享有同等的权利和义务。双方同意，在丰沙里和桑怒两省建立王国行政机构，王国政府保证把寮国战斗部队并入国家军队。虽然这些重大问题的原则性协议的具体实施，还有待于双方的进一步协商，但这已经为老挝的和平统一奠定了可靠的基石。
    老挝人民为了争取祖国的和平统一，曾经作了长期的努力。按照日内瓦协议，老挝在1954年8月实现停战以后，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方就开始进行了直接的接触，以谋求祖国的统一。在三年多的长时间里，双方进行了多次协商，遭遇过不少的困难和周折，特别美帝国主义及其代理人的从中干涉和破坏，使老挝人民和平统一祖国的愿望未能迅速实现。但是，和平统一自己的国家，是老挝全体人民坚定不移的要求。这次，在双方的努力下，终于达成了成立联合政府的协议。这说明老挝人民争取和平统一祖国的意志，是任何力量也阻止不住的。
    按照双方达成的协议，行将成立的老挝王国联合政府，将以富马亲王今年8月9日提出的施政纲领作为政治纲领，这是具有重要意义的。富马亲王当时对老挝王国国民议会保证：在对内政策方面，要把实现老挝王国的统一作为头一号迫切任务，并保证王国政府严格而忠实地遵守它同寮国战斗部队所签订的协定，特别是关于成立联合政府的协议；在对外政策方面，要奉行和平中立政策，遵守和平共处五项原则。这些政治纲领如果能够充分实施，无疑将使老挝王国的民族团结进一步加强，民族独立进一步巩固，从而使老挝人民获得进行和平建设的更大的保证；同时，这对于加强老挝同亚洲国家特别是同邻国的友好合作，对于促进亚非地区的和平，也将产生有利的影响。
    但是，对老挝王国抱有侵略野心、并力图在东南亚制造紧张局势的帝国主义国家，决不愿意看到老挝王国和平统一的实现。它们正在继续进行干涉和破坏活动，力图影响老挝政治局势的和平发展。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”透露，美国正对老挝的局势“感到担忧”。因此，老挝人民仍需要提高警惕，提防外来的干涉阴谋。
    中国人民同老挝人民是近邻，这些年来我们两国的友谊有了很大的发展。我们衷心地希望老挝王国和平统一的迅速实现，并在独立发展的道路上顺利前进。
