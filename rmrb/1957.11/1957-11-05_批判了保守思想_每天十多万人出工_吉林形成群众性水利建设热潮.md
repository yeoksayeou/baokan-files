Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 4th – After water conservancy departments in Jilin Province criticized conservative thinking, the figures for water conservancy construction in 1958 greatly increased. According to statistics, the province's planned irrigated area of farmland has been raised from the originally reported 97,000+ hectares to 119,000+ hectares.

By October 29th, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and 19 cities and counties had completed 226 reservoirs and ponds, 20 river dams, and 15 other small-scale water conservancy projects; 561 reservoirs and ponds, 131 river dams, 6 mechanical pumping stations, and 110 other small-scale projects are under construction. Currently, more than 100,000 people are working on projects in Jilin Province every day.

The irrigated area of farmland in Jilin Province had been developed to more than 360,000 hectares during the First Five-Year Plan, an increase of more than threefold compared to 1952. However, there were also some shortcomings. People with conservative thinking used this as a reason to believe that the development of paddy fields was advancing too rashly and should not be continued!

After the closing of the Jilin Provincial Water Conservancy Conference, water conservancy conferences were generally held in various counties of Jilin Province. By summarizing the achievements of water conservancy construction, everyone was mobilized to calculate four accounts: water sources, land, labor, and projects. Concrete facts were used to criticize conservative thinking, and a water conservancy construction plan for 1958 was formulated.

At present, a mass movement for farmland water conservancy construction has been formed in many places. In Fuyu County, 43 townships have completed the work of restoring embankments and closing breaches, and more than 50 projects for flood control and irrigation are under full-scale construction. Before the ground freezes, 70% of the various projects can be completed. Huai’de and other counties have made proper arrangements for this year's construction plans and labor organization. Major large-scale dam reservoirs and other projects can be completed ahead of schedule before the winter freeze.

    批判了保守思想　每天十多万人出工
    吉林形成群众性水利建设热潮
    新华社长春4日电　吉林省各地水利部门批判了保守思想后，1958年兴修水利的数字大为增加。据统计，全省农田灌溉面积计划已由原报九万七千多公顷提高到十一万九千多公顷。
    延边朝鲜族自治州及十九个市、县到10月29日止，已修完水库塘坝二百二十六座，拦河坝二十座，其他各项小型水利十五处；正在施工的水库塘坝有五百六十一座，拦河坝一百三十一处，机械抽水站六处，其它小型工程一百一十项。现在吉林省每天出工的人数达十多万人。
    吉林省的农田灌溉面积在第一个五年计划期间已发展到三十六万多公顷，比1952年增加三倍多。但其中也存在一些缺点。有着保守思想的人，借此认为发展水田冒进了，不能再开了！
    吉林省水利会议闭幕后，吉林省各县普遍召开了水利会议，通过总结水利建设的成绩，发动大家算水源、土地、劳力、工程等四笔账，以具体事实批判了保守思想，并订出了1958年水利建设计划。
    目前许多地方已经形成群众性的农田水利建设高潮。扶余县四十三个乡完成了复堤堵口工作，五十多处治涝、灌溉工程全面进行施工。在结冻前各项工程可完成70％，怀德等县对今年施工计划和劳力组织均作了妥善安排，主要大型筑坝水库等工程，可提前在冬季封冻之前完工。
