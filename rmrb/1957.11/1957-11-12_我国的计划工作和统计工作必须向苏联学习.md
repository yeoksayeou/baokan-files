    Our Planning and Statistical Work Must Learn from the Soviet Union
    Xue Muqiao
    The great October Socialist Revolution is a milestone in the development of human history, creating the first socialist country in human history. For forty years, under the illumination of Marxism-Leninism, the Soviet Union has been following the bright road of socialism and communism.
    Our country's eight years of socialist construction have been basically carried out along the path taken by the Soviet Union. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, leading us to establish a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, to establish and develop a socialist economy, and to propose in a timely manner the general task of the state during the transition period as soon as the task of restoring the national economy was completed, which is to gradually realize socialist industrialization and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Obviously, we are basically advancing along the path of the Soviet Union.
    In order to build socialism in our country, we must not only rely on the highly developed industry and technology of the Soviet Union to help us carry out economic construction, especially heavy industry construction, but also conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism and managing the socialist economy, especially the experience in planned management of the national economy, and the experience in planning and statistical work established for planned management.
    Our country's planning and statistical work not only basically learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but was also established with the help of Soviet experts. Of course, when we learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we must combine it with our own country's conditions and establish planning and statistical work suitable for our own country's conditions. Due to the complexity of our country's economy, our planning and statistical work must adopt more diverse methods. However, in all basic and major aspects, our country and the Soviet Union are roughly the same, and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is still the most important basis for us to establish planning and statistical work.
    Why do we say that in basic and major aspects, our country is roughly the same as the Soviet Union? Because the national economies of our two countries are both based on the socialist public ownership of the means of production, and have the common goal of building socialism and communism. At the beginning of our liberation, although individual ownership and capitalist ownership of the means of production still existed widely, the state-owned economy under the ownership of the whole people occupied a leading position in the national economy. The political and economic leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy made it possible and necessary for our country to establish a socialist planned management system, and made it possible to gradually incorporate various economic components into the track of the state plan separately. In 1956, we achieved a decisive victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, that is, a decisive victory in the transformation of the ownership of the means of production. In this way, the planning of the national economy can be further strengthened and improved. Obviously, our country's economic foundation and construction goals are the same as those of the Soviet Union, and fundamentally different from those of capitalist countries. Our construction goal is to maximize the satisfaction of the growing material and cultural needs of the people of the whole country, rather than to ensure that the bourgeoisie obtains the maximum profit. This most basic feature determines that we must follow the path of the Soviet Union, and must not follow the path of any capitalist country.
    The above-mentioned basic characteristics determine that our country must establish a socialist planned management system, and must not allow the anarchy of the capitalist economy to continue to exist and develop. In order to establish a socialist planned management system, we must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and establish socialist planning and statistical work. Planning and statistics are extremely important tools for managing the socialist economy. Lenin once said, "Socialism is calculation," and that "all plans are scales, norms, beacons, and signposts," and "without long-term plans with far-reaching goals, one cannot work." He also often proposed "to implement the most strict statistics and supervision throughout the country on the production and distribution of products." Lenin placed planning and statistical work in such an important position, regarding it as an extremely important tool for managing the socialist economy. The forty years of experience in the Soviet Union and the eight years of experience in our country have fully proved that Lenin's instructions are very important.
    Certain bourgeois scholars and revisionists within the proletariat attempt to deny the necessity of implementing planned management of the national economy. They believe that planned management is to bind freedom and will produce bureaucracy; they advocate implementing "economic democracy" and adopting a laissez-faire policy towards all economic activities, completely allowing the law of value to freely regulate. Obviously, if we accept their suggestions, it is tantamount to abolishing the socialist system and allowing the restoration of the capitalist system. Everyone knows that laissez-faireism is a product of the capitalist system. Under the capitalist system, this laissez-faireism guarantees the "freedom" and "economic democracy" of a few capitalists, but the broad masses of working people do not get any "freedom" and "economic democracy" because of this. This system protects the "freedom" to cruelly exploit the working people, the "freedom" to engage in speculation and sabotage public interests, and the freedom to seize high profits by various selfish means. Before our liberation, imperialists and bureaucratic capitalists used such "freedom" to cruelly plunder the people of the whole country. After liberation, urban and rural bourgeois speculators still wanted to maintain this "freedom," and they opposed the state's market management and unified purchase and sales policies for stabilizing prices and ensuring the rational distribution of important consumer goods. Obviously, the working people of the whole country will not welcome such "freedom" and "economic democracy."
    The public ownership of the means of production not only makes it possible for the state, but also makes it responsible for overall consideration and comprehensive arrangements for the country's economic activities and people's lives. The private industry and commerce that developed under the laissez-faire system before our liberation were not in line with the needs of the state and the people. Should we adopt a laissez-faire policy and let them compete freely and perish on their own? Or should the state take overall consideration, make comprehensive arrangements, and gradually incorporate them into the track of the state plan? Obviously, the latter method is much better than the former. Even among the national bourgeoisie in our country, except for a few speculators, there is a general demand for the state to take the latter method. Eight years of experience have fully proved that the state's overall arrangements are the most effective way to ensure the normal development of industry and commerce, especially to stabilize the market and ensure the supply of people's lives. The so-called overall arrangement is essentially socialist planned management under the condition of the coexistence of multiple economies. For socialist countries, it is the state's responsibility to make overall arrangements for the country's economic activities in order to ensure the development of production and the gradual improvement of people's lives. Is this not very obvious?
    After our country's socialist transformation of the national economy has achieved a decisive victory, the state-owned economy and the cooperative economy based on the socialist public ownership of the means of production have occupied an absolutely dominant position in the national economy. This victory makes it possible for us to more perfectly adopt the experience of the Soviet Union to further strengthen the planned management of the national economy and further improve our planning and statistical work. According to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, our country's planning work must start from the 600 million people, take overall consideration, and make appropriate arrangements. It is necessary to correctly handle the proportion of accumulation and consumption in the distribution of national income. The use of accumulation funds must adhere to the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift, and the use of consumption funds must make appropriate arrangements for the lives of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. It is necessary to maintain the balance of all aspects of the national economy in the process of socialist industrialization, such as the balance between industry and agriculture, the balance within industry and within agriculture, the balance between national construction and the supply of means of production, and the balance between people's purchasing power and the supply of consumer goods. Our statistical organs must also provide accurate and scientifically based statistical data for the study of the above-mentioned issues. To this end, we must learn from the Soviet Union even better.
    Of course, our emphasis on the planned nature of the national economy does not completely negate the flexibility that should exist in the planned management system and in the process of plan implementation. In this regard, the Soviet Union also has many valuable experiences for us to refer to. For example, adopting different planned management methods for different economic components, adopting direct planning for the state-owned economy and indirect planning for the cooperative economy; for example, under the condition of strictly implementing the state plan, giving local authorities and enterprises a certain degree of autonomy to encourage their enthusiasm and creativity. Soviet experience has long told us that any plan will never be without changes in the process of implementation. Therefore, the statistical organs must promptly check the implementation of the plan, promptly discover the possible imbalances and imbalances in the development of various sectors of the national economy, so that the planning departments can take appropriate measures in a timely manner to quickly solve them. The various competent departments, regions, and enterprises should also have a certain degree of power to promptly resolve the contradictions they may be able to resolve.
    However, is there anything similar between our view of the flexibility of the national economic planning and management system and the right-wing elements' demand to abolish the planning and management system and adopt a laissez-faire system? Obviously, there is no similarity at all.
    The socialist planned management system has unparalleled superiority compared with the capitalist laissez-faire system. Although the unplanned production of capitalism can also be spontaneously regulated through the law of value and other laws, their regulation is achieved through the destruction of certain parts of the national economy, such as the closure of certain enterprises, the unemployment of certain laborers, and the damage of certain assets. These capitalist economic laws not only bring constant destructive effects to the development of the national economy, but also bring periodic economic crises, which cause greater damage to the national economy. In our country, in 1950, immediately after the stabilization of prices, capitalist industry and commerce also fell into a difficult situation for a time. If the state had adopted a laissez-faire attitude at that time, many industries and businesses might have closed down one after another. Socialist countries cannot take such measures. They also adopted an overall planning policy for capitalist industry and commerce to help them overcome their difficulties. After the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce was completed, the state was even more powerful and had a greater responsibility to make overall arrangements for various departments of the national economy to ensure the planned and proportionate development of the national economy.
    The socialist planned management system not only ensures the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, but also ensures that the people of the whole country enjoy a stable life and can expect to gradually improve their living standards along with the development of production. This is obviously worlds apart from the situation in capitalist countries where the working people are constantly threatened by unemployment and rising prices and cannot control their own destiny at all. Although our people's living standards are not very high due to the low level of social productivity, they are obviously optimistic about their future. Therefore, they are full of energy and have a high degree of self-confidence in their work. This phenomenon is definitely not seen in the declining capitalist countries.
    The rightists believe that the Soviet Union has economic plans, and some capitalist countries also have "economic plans," and they are also interfering in economic activities; therefore, our country does not necessarily have to learn from the Soviet Union, but can also learn from capitalist countries. Tell the rightists that there can be no real planned economy on the basis of private ownership of the means of production; the so-called "economic plans" of capitalist countries are completely different from the economic plans of socialist countries. Under the conditions that the means of production are still in the hands of a minority of the bourgeoisie, and even in the hands of foreign capitalists, and under the conditions that the bourgeoisie still controls the political power, the so-called "economic plans" can never proceed from the interests of the people of the whole country, but can only proceed from the interests of a minority of the bourgeoisie. The role of the plan can only be to adjust the internal contradictions of the bourgeoisie to a certain extent, to adjust the contradictions between various monopoly capital groups; or the state uses the expansion of arms production and other public works investment, and wastes manpower and material resources to alleviate the crisis of overproduction. What is there to learn from such an economic plan?
    Not only that, but the rightists also wantonly attacked our statistical work, saying that the statistics of socialist countries are unscientific and untrue, and not as good as those of capitalist countries; we should not learn from the Soviet Union, but should learn from capitalist countries. What is the truth? Are the statistics unscientific and untrue in socialist countries or capitalist countries? Obviously, it is capitalist countries, not socialist countries. The statistics of socialist countries are based on the political economy of Marxism-Leninism, and use scientific indicator systems and grouping methods to analyze the quantitative and qualitative changes in the development of the national economy. This method can see through the surface phenomena, insight into the essence of things, and discover the inherent contradictions and development laws of things. The statistics of capitalist countries are the opposite. They use some cumbersome mathematical formulas to cover up the true situation of social and economic development, especially to cover up the essence of class exploitation in capitalist society and the law that capitalism must die and socialism must win. Socialism is a newborn force, and it will never be afraid to expose its true colors; on the contrary, it tells the people of the whole country the truth without reservation. Only in this way can we consolidate our achievements, correct our shortcomings, and mobilize the people of the whole country to work hard to overcome various difficulties in our progress and strive for greater victories. May I ask, will the bourgeoisie and capitalist countries, which are in decline, have such great courage to tell the people the truth?
    The statistical work of socialist countries, like planning work, has a high degree of superiority. This is because our statistical work is based on the socialist public ownership of the means of production. The socialist system makes it possible for us to establish a unified accounting system for the national economy, and it is possible to require all enterprises to report their economic activities to the statistical organs on time. Refusing to report or making false reports is illegal. The local governments at all levels and the economic management departments in socialist countries are particularly concerned about statistical work, regarding it as an important tool for doing a good job in economic management. Socialist countries not only use statistical data as an important basis for making policies and formulating plans, but also use it to regularly and comprehensively check the implementation of state plans, thus playing a supervisory role in the economic activities of various departments and enterprises. It is unimaginable in any capitalist country that socialist countries place statistical work in such an important position. Although there are also some honest statisticians in capitalist countries, they demand to expose the true situation of capitalist society. However, they stand outside the iron curtain of bourgeois "trade secrets" and are finally powerless and can only sigh in vain.
    The rightists in our country often boast about the social surveys they have done in the past, as if only they know scientific survey and statistical methods, and we must learn from them. In fact, we attach importance to any survey and statistical data as long as it can reflect a little bit of the real situation. However, if we compare the social surveys done by the rightists with our social surveys, then not only in the scale of the survey, we are all over the country, and they are just a drop in the ocean; but also in the scientific and realistic nature of the survey, we are much better than them. In terms of social surveys, the socialist system also has significant advantages. Under the capitalist system, the interests of the state are contradictory to the interests of the broad masses of working people. Therefore, when the state and the academic institutions established by the state conduct social surveys among the working people, they cannot get the sincere cooperation of the working people, so the authenticity of the data obtained is very poor. In socialist countries, the interests of the state are basically consistent with the interests of the broad masses of working people. Our party and government attach special importance to the mass line, and most of our grassroots cadres, including statistical cadres, have established close ties with the masses. Therefore, when they conduct social surveys, they can get the well-meaning cooperation of the masses, and the authenticity is guaranteed.
    The planning and statistical work of the Soviet Union has achieved remarkable achievements in both theory and practice. Our country's planning and statistical work has been able to establish rapidly in a short period of time and basically meet the needs of socialist construction and socialist planned management due to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. However, we have not learned enough and need to continue to learn. As long as we pay attention to combining with our country's actual situation and flexibly applying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in our study, we will never make dogmatic mistakes. On the issue of learning from the Soviet Union, we must both prevent the mistakes of dogmatism and prevent the mistakes of revisionism, and prevent deviating from the path of the Soviet Union in some basic issues, thus violating Marxism-Leninism. Of course, we must also oppose the attacks of the bourgeois rightists on our country's socialist system and on our country's socialist planning and statistical work. We must shout: "Take the path of the Russians - this is the conclusion."

    我国的计划工作和统计工作必须向苏联学习
    薛暮桥
    伟大的十月社会主义革命是人类历史发展的里程碑，它在人类历史上创造了第一个社会主义国家。四十年来，苏联在马克思列宁主义的照耀下，走着光明的社会主义、共产主义道路。
    我国八年来的社会主义建设，是基本上沿着苏联所走过的道路进行的。以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的实践相结合，领导我们建立了工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，建立并发展了社会主义经济，并在恢复国民经济的任务刚刚完成的时候，适时地提出了国家在过渡时期的总任务，就是逐步实现社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。很明显，我们是基本上沿着苏联的道路前进的。
    为着要在我国建设社会主义，就不仅要依靠苏联高度发展的工业和技术，来帮助我国进行经济建设，特别是重工业建设；而且要认真学习苏联建设社会主义和管理社会主义经济的先进经验，特别是对国民经济进行计划管理的经验，和为着计划管理而建立的计划工作和统计工作的经验。
    我国的计划工作和统计工作，不仅是基本上学习了苏联的先进经验，而且是在苏联专家们的帮助下建立起来的。当然，在我们学习苏联先进经验的时候，必须结合着我国自己的情况，建立适合于我国自己情况的计划工作和统计工作；由于我国经济的复杂性，我们的计划工作和统计工作必须采取更加多种多样的办法。但是，在一切基本方面，主要方面，我国和苏联大致相同，苏联的先进经验，仍然是我们建立计划工作和统计工作的最重要的依据。
    为什么说在基本方面，主要方面，我国与苏联大致相同呢？因为我们两国的国民经济都是建立在生产资料的社会主义公有制的基础上，而且有着建设社会主义、共产主义的共同目标。我国在初解放的时候，虽然还广泛地存在着生产资料的个体所有制和资本家所有制，但在国民经济中占领导地位的是全民所有制的国营经济。工人阶级和国营经济在政治上和经济上的领导地位，使我国同样也具备了建立社会主义计划管理制度的必要性和可能性，有可能把各种经济成分分别地、逐步地纳入国家计划的轨道。1956年我们对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造取得了决定性的胜利，即在生产资料所有制的改造方面取得了决定性的胜利，这样，国民经济的计划化就有可能进一步加强和提高。显然，我国的经济基础和建设目标，是与苏联相同，而与资本主义国家根本不相同的。我们建设的目标，是要最大限度地满足全国人民不断增长的物质和文化生活需要，而不是为保证资产阶级取得最大限度利润。这样一个最基本的特点，决定着我们必须走苏联的道路，而决不能走任何一个资本主义国家的道路。
    上述基本特点决定着我国必须建立社会主义的计划管理制度，而决不能让资本主义经济的无政府状态继续存在，继续发展。为了建立社会主义的计划管理制度，就必须学习苏联的先进经验，建立社会主义的计划工作和统计工作。计划和统计是管理社会主义经济的极重要的工具，列宁早就说过，“社会主义就是计算”，他说“一切计划，都是尺度、规范、灯塔、路标”，“如果没有目标远大的长期计划就不能工作”他又常常提出要“对产品的生产与分配上实行普及全国的最严格的统计与监督”。列宁把计划和统计工作放在如此重要的地位，把它当作管理社会主义经济的极重要的工具。苏联建国四十年的经验，和我国建国八年来的经验，都充分地证明了列宁的指示是十分重要的。
    某些资产阶级学者和无产阶级内部的修正主义者，企图否定对国民经济实行计划管理的必要性，他们认为计划管理就是束缚自由，就会产生官僚主义；他们主张实行“经济民主”，主张对一切经济活动采取放任政策，完全让价值规律来自由调节。显然，如果我们接受了他们的建议，就等于取消社会主义制度，容许资本主义制度复辟。谁都知道，自由放任主义是资本主义制度的产物，在资本主义制度下，这种自由放任主义保证了少数资本家的“自由”和“经济民主”，但广大劳动人民却并没有因此而得到什么“自由”和“经济民主”。这种制度保护的是残酷剥削劳动人民的“自由”，实行投机倒把破坏公共利益的“自由”，采取各种自私自利手段攫取高额利润的自由。我国解放以前，帝国主义者和官僚资本家就曾经利用了这样的“自由”，而对全国人民进行了残酷的掠夺。解放以后，城市和乡村的资产阶级投机分子仍想保持这种“自由”，他们反对国家为着稳定物价，保证重要消费品的合理分配而进行的市场管理和统购统销政策。显然，全国劳动人民是不会欢迎这样的“自由”和“经济民主”的。
    生产资料的全民所有制不但使国家有可能，而且有责任来对全国的经济活动和人民生活实行统筹兼顾，全面安排。我国解放前在自由放任制度下发展起来的私营工商业，同国家和人民的需要是不相符合的。我们究竟采取自由放任政策，让它们自由竞争，自生自灭好呢？还是由国家来统筹兼顾，全面安排，逐步地把它们纳入国家计划的轨道好呢？显然，后一办法比前一办法好得多，就是我国的民族资产阶级中，除少数投机分子外，也普遍要求国家采取后一办法。八年来的经验充分证明，国家的统筹安排是保证工商业的正常发展，尤其是稳定市场，保证人民生活供应的最有效的办法。而所谓统筹安排，实质上就是多种经济并存条件下的社会主义计划管理。对于社会主义国家来说，对全国的经济活动进行统筹安排，以保证生产的发展和人民生活的逐步改善，这是国家所应尽的责任，这一点难道还不十分明显吗？
    在我国国民经济的社会主义改造取得决定性的胜利以后，建立在生产资料的社会主义公有制基础上的国营经济和合作社经济已在国民经济中占绝对统治地位，这一胜利使我们有可能更完善地采用苏联的经验，来进一步加强国民经济的计划管理，进一步提高我们的计划工作和统计工作。根据毛泽东同志的指示，我国的计划工作必须从六亿人民出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排。必须正确处理国民收入分配中积累同消费的比例，积累基金的使用必须掌握勤俭建国的方针，消费基金的使用必须对工人、农民、知识分子的生活作适当的安排。必须在社会主义工业化的建设过程中，保持国民经济各方面的平衡，如工业同农业的平衡，工业内部和农业内部的平衡，国家建设同生产资料供应间的平衡，人民购买力同消费品供应间的平衡等。我们的统计机关，也必须对上述问题的研究，提供确实的、有科学根据的统计资料。为此，就必须更好地向苏联学习。
    当然，我们强调国民经济的计划性，并不是完全否定了在计划管理制度中，和在计划执行过程中应有的灵活性。在这方面，苏联也有许多宝贵的经验可供我们参考。比如对不同的经济成份采用不同的计划管理方法，对国营经济采用直接计划，对合作社经济采用间接计划；比如在严格执行国家计划的条件下，予地方和企业以一定程度的机动权，以鼓励其积极性和创造性。苏联的经验早已告诉我们，任何计划在执行过程中决不会丝毫没有变动。因此统计机关必须及时检查计划的执行情况，及时发现国民经济各部门在发展过程中可能产生的不协调和不平衡现象，以便计划部门及时采取适当的措施来迅速予以解决。各业务主管部门、各地区、各企业也应当有一定的权力，来及时解决它们可能解决的矛盾。
    但是，我们对国民经济计划管理制度的灵活性的看法，同资产阶级右派分子要求取消计划管理制度，采用自由放任制度的看法，是不是有类似的地方呢？显然，并没有丝毫类似的地方。
    社会主义的计划管理制度同资本主义的自由放任制度比较，具有无比的优越性。资本主义的无计划的生产虽然通过价值规律和其它各种规律，也能够进行自发的调节。但它们的调节是通过国民经济某些部分的破坏来实现的，如某些企业的倒闭，某些劳动者的失业，和某些资财的损毁等。这种资本主义经济规律不但对国民经济的发展带来经常的破坏作用，而且带来周期性的经济危机，使国民经济受到更大的破坏。我国1950年紧接着物价的稳定以后，资本主义工商业也曾一度陷入困难的境地。当时如果国家采取自由放任态度，就可能有很多的工商业纷纷倒闭。社会主义国家不能采取这样的办法，它对资本主义工商业也采取了统筹兼顾的政策，帮助它们渡过难关。在资本主义工商业完成了社会主义改造以后，国家就更有力量和更有责任来对国民经济各部门进行统筹安排，以保证国民经济的有计划、按比例发展。
    社会主义计划管理制度不但保证工农业生产的迅速发展，而且保证全国劳动人民享受安定的生活，可以指望跟着生产的发展而逐步地提高自己的生活水平。这同资本主义国家的劳动人民经常受失业和物价高涨威胁，完全不能掌握自己命运的情况比较，显然是有天渊之别。尽管我们由于社会生产力还很低，人民的生活水平还不很高，但他们对于自己的前途显然是乐观的，因而在劳动中精神饱满，有高度的自信心。这种现象，在没落中的资本主义国家是肯定看不到的。
    右派分子认为苏联有经济计划，某些资本主义国家也有“经济计划”，他们也在干预经济活动；因此我国不一定要向苏联学习，也可以向资本主义国家学习。告诉右派分子，在生产资料私有制的基础上，不可能有真正的计划经济；资本主义国家所谓“经济计划”，同社会主义国家的经济计划完全是两回事。在生产资料还掌握在资产阶级少数人手里，甚至还掌握在外国资本家手里的条件下，在资产阶级还掌握着政权的条件下，所谓“经济计划”，决不可能从全国人民的利益出发，而只能从资产阶级少数人的利益出发。计划的作用，只能是在一定的程度上调整资产阶级的内部矛盾，调整各个垄断资本集团间的矛盾；或者是国家用扩大军火生产和其它一些公共工程的投资，用浪费人力物力的办法来缓和生产过剩的危机。这样的经济计划，究竟有什么值得我们学习呢？
    不仅如此，右派分子对我们的统计工作也肆意攻击，说社会主义国家的统计不科学，不真实，比不上资本主义国家；我们不应该向苏联学习，而应该向资本主义国家学习。事实究竟怎样？统计不科学，不真实的究竟是社会主义国家，还是资本主义国家呢？显然，是资本主义国家，而不是社会主义国家。社会主义国家的统计是建立在马克思列宁主义的政治经济学的基础上，用科学的指标体系和分组方法来分析国民经济发展中的量和质的变化，这种方法能够透过表面现象洞察事物的本质，发现事物的内在矛盾和发展规律。资本主义国家的统计则与此相反，他们用一些繁琐的数学公式来掩盖了社会经济发展的真实情况，特别是掩盖了资本主义社会阶级剥削的本质，资本主义必然要死亡和社会主义必然要胜利的规律。社会主义是新生的力量，它是决不会害怕暴露自己的真实面貌的；相反的它毫无保留地把真实情况告诉全国人民。只有如此，才能巩固成绩，纠正缺点，动员全国人民来努力克服前进中的各种困难，争取更大的胜利。试问，正在没落中的资产阶级和资本主义国家，会不会有这样大的勇气来向人民说老实话呢？
    社会主义国家的统计工作也同计划工作一样有高度的优越性，这是由于我们的统计工作是建立在生产资料的社会主义公有制的基础上。社会主义制度使我们有可能建立国民经济的统一的核算制度，有可能要求一切企业都向统计机关按时报告自己的经济活动，拒不报告或做假报告都是违法行为。社会主义国家的各级地方政府和各经济管理部门都特别关心统计工作，把它当作做好经济管理工作的一个重要工具。社会主义国家不但把统计资料作为决定政策、制订计划的重要依据，而且通过它来经常地、全面地检查国家计划的执行情况，因而对各部门、各企业的经济活动发挥监督作用。社会主义国家把统计工作放在这样重要的地位，这在任何资本主义国家都是不能想像的。资本主义国家虽然也有一些正直的统计学家，他们要求揭露资本主义社会的真实情况。但他们站在资产阶级“商业秘密”的铁幕外面，终于无能为力，只能徒唤奈何罢了。
    我国的右派分子常常夸耀他们过去所作的社会调查，好像只有他们懂得科学的调查统计方法，我们非向他们学习不可。事实上，我们对于任何调查统计资料，只要能够反映一点真实情况，都是予以重视的。但是，如果把右派分子所作的社会调查，来和我们的社会调查比较，那就不但在调查的规模上，我们遍及全国，而他们只是沧海一粟；而且在调查的科学性、真实性上，我们也比他们高明得多。在社会调查方面，社会主义制度也有着显著的优越性。在资本主义制度下，国家同广大劳动人民的利益是矛盾的；因此，国家和国家所建立的学术机关在向劳动人民进行社会调查时，决不能得到劳动人民的真诚的合作，这样所得到的资料真实性就很差。在社会主义国家，国家同广大劳动人民的利益基本上是一致的。我们的党和政府又特别重视群众路线，我们的基层工作干部，包括统计工作干部在内，大多数同群众建立了密切的联系。因而他们在进行社会调查时候，能够得到群众的善意的合作，真实性就有了保证。
    苏联的计划工作和统计工作不论在理论方面、实践方面，都已经取得了卓越的成就。我国的计划工作和统计工作由于学习了苏联的先进经验，因而能在短时期内迅速建立起来，并基本上适合于社会主义建设和社会主义计划管理的需要。但是，我们学习得还十分不够，还需要继续学习。只要我们在学习中时刻地注意到结合我国的实际情况，灵活运用苏联的先进经验，就决不会犯教条主义的错误。在学习苏联这个问题上，我们既要防止教条主义的错误，更要防止修正主义的错误，防止在某些基本问题方面离开了苏联的道路，因而违反了马克思列宁主义。当然，我们更要反对资产阶级右派分子对我国社会主义制度、对我国社会主义计划工作和统计工作的攻击。我们要高呼：“走俄国人的路——这就是结论”。
