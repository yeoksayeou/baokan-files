Is Absenteeism Right? By Our Reporter Gu Ye
Is absenteeism right? Some workers in the Yangquan Mining Bureau's No. 1 Mine have not thoroughly understood this for a long time.

In September, the Party Committee of the No. 1 Mine organized workers to debate this issue.

At a workers' meeting of a shift in the 171 Coal Mining Team, young coal shoveler Sun Xiaowa said, "I don't think absenteeism is a big deal. It doesn't have a big impact if a shift is short one or two people. Besides, we are paid according to our labor now. If you don't work, you don't get paid." Jiang Hui continued, "That's right! You earn a day's wage for a day's work, and if you're absent, you don't get paid. The state doesn't lose out. What's unreasonable about that?"

At this point, some people nodded in agreement, while others frowned in thought. People discussed it animatedly.

"Xiaowa is right!"
"Don't talk nonsense if you're not sure."
"This isn't about being sure or not. It's about each person's understanding. Debate can clarify whether the understanding is right or wrong."

Li Caiyuan said, "Xiaowa, you say it doesn't matter if a shift is short one person. If we all acted like you, working when we wanted and being absent when we felt like it, then we wouldn't need to produce anything, and the production plan would be impossible to complete. Don't you think that's a big problem?" As soon as Li Caiyuan finished speaking, Gao Baochang stood up and said, "If you have money, you want to rest for a few days, and when you run out of money, you go back to work. What kind of working class is that? Today, the working class is the leading class, and it is organized and disciplined. If everyone was as undisciplined and individualistic as Xiaowa, it would be impossible to even maintain the status quo, let alone build socialism."

"How much impact does absenteeism actually have on production?" Sun Xiaowa asked in a low voice.

"How many days have you been absent?" Xu Erhe retorted.

Sun Xiaowa then remembered the time he insisted on returning home after his leave was not approved. His face flushed, and he said, "I've been absent for five workdays since the beginning of the year."

Xu Erhe said, "Don't think five days isn't much. On a larger scale, if our coal mining team is short one person, it means we produce twenty tons of coal less per shift. Five days is one hundred tons. Based on a cost of nine yuan per ton, that's a total of nine hundred yuan less revenue for the country. And the auxiliary workers are still the same number, and the state still pays them their wages as usual. On a smaller scale, if you're absent for one workday, you earn three yuan less, totaling fifteen yuan. Just because wages are higher and you have some money, you don't want to work. Not working causes such a big loss to the country!"

This accounting was vivid and persuasive. Sun Xiaowa felt as relieved as if he had dropped a heavy burden and said, "I recognize the harm absenteeism does to the country. I will never be absent again."

After this debate, the workers' attendance rate increased. The average daily output in August was 819 tons, which rose to 1,025 tons in September and further increased to 1,283 tons in October. (Attached picture)

    旷工对不对？	本报记者　顾页
    旷工对不对？阳泉矿务局一矿有一部分工人，长期没有彻底弄明白。
    9月里，一矿党委组织工人辩论这个问题。
    在171采煤队一个班的工人集会上，青年攉煤工孙小娃说：“我认为旷工没有啥，一个班少个把人影响不大。再说，现在是按劳取酬，不劳动不拿工资呗。”姜辉接着说：“是呵！上一天班挣一天工资，旷工就不要钱，国家不吃亏，这有什么不合理？”
    这时，有的人点头同意，有的人把眉眼皱到一块思索。人们七嘴八舌地议论着。
    “小娃说得有理！”
    “嘴不稳当别胡言乱语。”
    “这不是嘴稳当不稳当的问题，是各人的认识，认识是错是对，辩论就能弄明白。”
    李财元说：“小娃，你说一个班少一个人影响不大，要是我们人人都像你那样，想干就干，想旷工就旷工，那就不用生产啦，生产计划就完不成啦，你看问题大不大？”李财元刚说完，高保成就站起来说：“有钱就想歇几天，没钱了再上班，这叫什么工人阶级？今天工人阶级是领导阶级，是有组织有纪律的，都像小娃那样自由散漫，别说建设社会主义，连维持现状都不可能。”
    “旷工对生产的影响，到底有多大呢？孙小娃低声问道。
    “你旷工几个？”许二和反问他。
    孙小娃这才想起那次请假不准硬回家的事，紫胀了脸说：“从年初以来旷了五个工。”
    许二和说：“你不要以为五个不多。从大的方面说，我们出煤班少一个人，一个班就少出二十吨煤，五个工就是一百吨，按每吨九元钱成本计算，总共少给国家增加九百元收入，而辅助工还是那些，国家照常给他们发工资。从小的方面说，旷一个工，你少收入三元，总共是十五元。就因为工资高了，你们手头活动了，就不想干活了。不干活，对国家的损失就这样大！”
    这笔账算得有声有色。孙小娃心情舒畅得好似丢了个大包袱，说：“我认清了旷工对国家的危害，今后决不旷工了。”
    经过这次辩论，工人出勤率提高了，平均日产量8月为八百十九吨，9月上升到一千零二十五吨，10月增至一千二百八十三吨。（附图片）
    我们人人要是都像你那样，想干就干，想旷工就旷工，那就不用生产啦！　　　　　苗地插图
