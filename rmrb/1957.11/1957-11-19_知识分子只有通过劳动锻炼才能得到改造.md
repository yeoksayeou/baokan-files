　　Intellectuals Can Only Be Transformed Through Labor Training

　　A very important task of ideological remolding of intellectuals is to resolutely stand on the working class's position politically, resolutely support socialism, and resolutely oppose capitalism. Many people were influenced by bourgeois education and thought in the past, creating a "preconceived" situation. They can often distinguish the boundaries between capitalism and socialism in abstract theory; however, in real life, they cannot clearly distinguish the boundaries between capitalism and socialism and often rely on or spontaneously tend towards capitalism. As the socialist revolution continues to deepen, the content of opposition to capitalist ideology will also become more in-depth and detailed. If one deviates from politics even slightly, one will immediately fall behind politically and even make serious mistakes.

　　This problem cannot be solved simply by reading a few communist books. Lenin wrote in "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues": "Without work, without struggle, communist knowledge obtained from communist pamphlets and books can be said to be worthless because this knowledge will still maintain the most abhorrent characteristic of the old capitalist society, that is, the separation of theory and practice."

　　Only by constantly caring about politics, participating in the actual struggle of the socialist revolution, closely relying on the leadership of the Party, and closely relying on the collective strength of the masses can one continuously transform one's subjective world in the process of transforming the objective world, gradually transform one's position and viewpoints, and gradually shed one's bourgeois individualism baggage. After unloading the baggage of individualism, one will become one with the collective and be of one heart with the Party. One will feel clear-headed and be able to clearly identify, expose, and eliminate all kinds of capitalist things, no matter how well they are disguised or hidden, and one will become a socialist collectivist fighter. There is no other "shortcut" besides this road.

　　Another very important task of ideological remolding of intellectuals is to integrate with the workers and peasants in terms of ideology and emotion, and wholeheartedly serve socialism.

　　Due to the influence of their background, education, working conditions, and other factors, the thoughts and feelings of intellectuals are often not integrated with the working people. They are often narrow-minded, constantly preoccupied with personal matters, and their ideas are always wrong. They talk about "socialism being a heroic and ambitious cause," but in reality, they just can't be heroic.

　　The fundamental solution to this problem is for intellectuals to live and work with workers and peasants more often. Only in this way can we talk about integrating, and only then can we talk about fundamentally changing our thoughts and feelings step by step.

专栏：报刊论文摘要

    知识分子只有通过劳动锻炼才能得到改造
    知识分子思想改造很重要的一个任务，是要在政治上坚决地站在工人阶级立场，坚决地拥护社会主义，坚决地反对资本主义。很多人过去受资产阶级教育和思想影响，造成了“先入为主”的局面，往往在抽象的理论上对资本主义和社会主义的界限尚能分得清楚；但是在实际生活中，对资本主义和社会主义就划不清界限，常常依恋或自发地倾向于资本主义。而随着社会主义革命的不断深入，反对资本主义思想的内容也会更深入更细致，如果稍一脱离政治，就会立刻在政治上落后，甚至会犯严重的错误。
    解决这个问题，决不能单纯地靠读几本共产主义的书籍。列宁在“青年团底任务”中写道：“没有工作，没有斗争，那末单从共产主义小册子和著作中求得的书本上的共产主义知识，可以说是一文钱不值，因为这种知识仍旧会是把资本主义旧社会中最可恶的特征，即理论与实践隔离的现象保持下去。”
    只有经常地关心政治，参加到社会主义革命的实际斗争中去，紧紧地依靠党的领导，紧紧地依靠群众的集体力量，才能在改造客观世界的过程中不断地改造自己的主观世界，才能逐步地改造自己的立场观点，才能逐步地摔掉自己的资产阶级个人主义的包袱。卸掉个人主义的包袱以后，就会和集体打成一片，和党一条心；就会感到眼目清亮，对各种资本主义的东西，不管它们伪装得如何好，隐藏得如何好，都能清晰地鉴别出来，揭发出来，加以消灭，自己也就成为社会主义的集体主义的战士。除了这条道路以外，别的“终南捷径”是没有的。
    知识分子思想改造很重要的另一个任务，是要在思想感情上同工农劳动人民打成一片，全心全意为社会主义服务。
    知识分子由于出身、所受教育、劳动条件等影响，思想感情和工农大众就往往不能打成一片。常常心情狭隘，牵来牵去就是个人这一套丢不开，想法总弄不对头，口头上讲“社会主义是英勇豪迈的事业”，实际上就是豪放不起来。
    解决这个问题，根本的办法是要知识分子多多和工农在一起生活，在一起劳动。这样才能谈得上打成一片，才能谈得上逐步地从根本上改变自己的思想感情。
