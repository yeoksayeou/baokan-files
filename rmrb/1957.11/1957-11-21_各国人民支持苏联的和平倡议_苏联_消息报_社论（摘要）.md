Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 20th. The "Izvestia" newspaper today published an editorial titled "People of All Countries Support Soviet Peace Initiatives," stating that during the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, a stronger call for strengthening world peace emanating from Moscow has been warmly received in the hearts of well-meaning people. The people of all countries warmly welcome the peace proposals embodied in the documents of the Supreme Soviet celebration meeting. They see once again that this socialist country is the standard-bearer raising the flag of equality and friendship among all nations.

The editorial points out that the people of all countries welcome with deep satisfaction the following specific proposals put forward by the Soviet Union: Representatives of capitalist and socialist countries hold high-level talks to reach an agreement, taking into account the actual situation and on the basis of mutual understanding, on avoiding the use of war as a method of resolving international problems; to stop the Cold War and the arms race, to establish relations between countries on the basis of peaceful coexistence, and to resolve disputes not by means of war, but by means of negotiations, and by developing economic, cultural, and peaceful competition in better meeting the needs and consumption of the people. The proposal for such talks made by Khrushchev in his report to the Supreme Soviet celebration meeting was supported by all socialist countries as well as millions of friends of peace in capitalist countries.

The newspaper points out that the public in socialist countries believes that the proposal to hold high-level talks is a far-sighted suggestion demonstrating a deep concern for the fate of the world. If the leaders of Western countries treat this opinion wisely, it will open up broad prospects for easing international tensions and eliminating the "Cold War." Is it a realistic thing for representatives of capitalist and socialist countries to hold meetings? Khrushchev said in answering a question from a reporter from the United Press that such talks may not be held in the near future. But the Soviet Union believes that there is no other way out, and talks should be held.

The editorial says that the broad public figures in the West and Asia and Africa are increasingly aware of the need to estimate the balance of power that has been formed. The advocates of the "position of strength" policy are trying to provoke new war hysteria to prevent practical discussion of problems in international life, but obviously, they have not achieved this goal. Sober-minded representatives of capitalism are increasingly aware that it is necessary to stop the destructive atomic arms race. Some well-known politicians in the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries have recently called for not "rejecting" the Soviet proposal to hold high-level talks, but for accepting this proposal, because the balance of power in the world will ultimately make such talks inevitable.

The editorial says that, regrettably, official Washington and London have adopted a different attitude towards the Soviet peace initiatives. This position once again confirms that the imperialist bloc is obstructing the easing of international tensions and attempting to continue the arms race at any cost, which poses a threat of a new destructive war. For example, the recent decision by Western countries to step up the expansion of nuclear and rocket weapons for member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and hand them over to German militarists is enough to confirm this.

The editorial concludes by saying that peace should be guaranteed. Peace can be guaranteed by uniting all peace-loving forces and improving the organization and activity of these forces.

    各国人民支持苏联的和平倡议
    ——苏联“消息报”社论（摘要）
    新华社莫斯科20日电　“消息报”今天以“各国人民支持苏联的和平倡议”为题发表社论说，在庆祝十月革命四十周年的日子里，从莫斯科发出的要求加强世界和平的更强有力的呼声已经在善良的人们的心中得到了热烈的响应。各国人民热烈欢迎这种体现在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝大会的文件中的和平主张。他们再次看到，这个社会主义国家是举起各国人民平等和友好的旗帜的旗手。
    社论指出，各国人民怀着深深满意的心情欢迎苏联提出的下列具体建议：资本主义国家和社会主义国家代表举行高级会谈，以便在考虑到实际情况和在彼此谅解的基础上就避免用战争作为解决国际问题的方法这一点上达成协议；停止冷战和军备竞赛，在共处基础上建立各国之间的关系，不用战争的办法、而用谈判的办法、在发展经济、文化和更好地满足人们的需求和消费方面展开和平竞赛的办法来解决争执问题。赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝大会上的报告中所提出的这种会谈的主张得到所有社会主义国家以及资本主义国家千百万和平的朋友的支持。
    报纸指出，社会主义各国的公众认为举行高级会谈的主张是表现出对世界命运深刻关怀的一个有远见的建议。如果西方国家的领导人明智地对待这个意见，那将给缓和国际紧张局势和消除“冷战”打开广阔的前景。资本主义国家和社会主义国家的代表举行会议，这是不是一件现实的事情呢？赫鲁晓夫在回答美国合众社记者的问题时说，在最近时期未必能举行这样的会谈。但是苏联认为，别的出路是没有的，应该举行会谈。
    社论说，西方和亚非的广大社会人士越来越深刻地认识到，必须估计已经形成的力量对比。“实力地位”政策的鼓吹者企图挑起新的战争歇斯底里来阻止对国际生活中的问题作实际讨论，显然，他们没有达到这个目的。头脑清醒的资本主义的代表人物已越来越清楚地认识到，停止进行毁灭性的原子军备竞赛是必要的。美、英、法和其他西方国家的一些知名的政治家近来要求不要把苏联提出的举行高级会谈的建议“拒于门外”，而要求接受这个建议，因为目前世界上力量的对比终究要使这种会谈成为不可避免的事。
    社论说，遗憾的是，华盛顿和伦敦的官方人士对苏联的和平倡议采取了另一种态度。这种立场再次证实，帝国主义集团是在阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，企图不惜用任何代价来继续进行军备竞赛，这也就造成了新的毁灭性战争的威胁。例如，西方国家最近决定加紧扩充北大西洋公约组织成员国的原子武器和火箭武器并且把这种武器交给德国军国主义分子，这些都足以证实这一点。
    社论最后说，和平应该得到保障。通过联合一切爱好和平的力量和提高这种力量的组织性和积极性的办法，是能够保障和平的。
