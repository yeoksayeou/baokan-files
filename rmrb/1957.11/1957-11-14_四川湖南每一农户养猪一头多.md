Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 11th: Sichuan Province has an average of 1.7 pigs raised per farming household, according to the latest announcement by the Sichuan Provincial Statistics Bureau. Statistical data shows that the province has more than 23.6 million pigs, which is three times more than the pre-war year of 1937 (estimated at 8 million by the Construction Department of the Kuomintang Sichuan Provincial Government). It is also more than 2 million more than 1954, the year with the highest number of pigs in history. Beichuan County, which has seen rapid development, has an average of 4.3 pigs per household. In Dazhong Agricultural Cooperative, Baishan Township, Cangxi County, each member household raises an average of more than 10 pigs.

Currently, the number of sows in the province is still increasing, with a 12.2% increase in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, laying a solid foundation for the continued development of pig farming in the province.

Sichuan farmers have developed many new feed sources to adapt to the development of pig farming. In the past month, agricultural cooperatives in various places have collected large quantities of newly harvested sweet potato vines to replace the old method of drying sweet potato leaves for feed. According to the experience of the state-owned Yuechi Farm and other places, this can increase the utilization rate of sweet potato vines by two times. The private plots of agricultural cooperative members in various places have also been planted with vegetables and feed crops.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 11th: Hunan Province currently has more than 9 million pigs, which is more than 4 million more than 1937 (5.03 million), the year with the highest pig production in history. The province has more than 8 million farming households, with an average of more than one pig raised per household. This year, pig farming in the province has provided 400 million dan of fertilizer for agricultural production and 500 million jin of meat for the people of the province. At the same time, it has supplied about 600,000 live pigs or frozen meat to major cities, industrial and mining areas, and for export. According to the plan of the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture, the province will have 10 million pigs in stock by the end of this year.

    四川湖南每一农户养猪一头多
    新华社成都11日电　四川省每一农户平均饲养着一点七头生猪。这是四川省统计局最近宣布的。根据统计材料全省饲养的生猪已达二千三百六十万多头，比抗战前的1937年（据国民党四川省政府建设厅估计为八百万头）增加两倍。比历史上养猪最多的1954年还多二百多万头。发展较快的北川县，全县每一农户平均养猪四点三头。苍溪县白山乡大众农业社每户社员平均养猪达十头多。
    现在，全省的母猪仍在增加，第三季度就比第二季度增加12．2％，为全省生猪继续发展打下了坚实基础。
    四川农民增辟了许多饲料来源以适应生猪发展。近一月来，各地农业社收藏了大批的新收获的红薯藤，以代替晒制干薯糠的旧办法。据国营岳池农场等地经验，这样作可以使红薯藤的利用率提高两倍。各地农业社社员的自留地，也都种上了蔬菜和饲料作物。
    新华社长沙11日电　湖南省生猪目前已有九百多万头，比历史上生猪产量最高的1937年（五百零三万头）还多四百多万头。这个省有八百多万农户，平均每一农户养猪一头多。今年，全省养猪已给农业生产提供了四亿担肥料，为全省人民供应了五亿斤肉食，同时，还给各大城市、工矿区和出口方面供应了约六十万头活猪或冻肉。按照湖南省农业部门计划，今年年底全省存栏生猪将有一千万头。
