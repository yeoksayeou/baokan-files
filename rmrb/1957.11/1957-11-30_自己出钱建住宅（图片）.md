Workers at the Fushun Tiger Platform Coal Mine are responding to the government's call and, with the help of the trade union, are building housing with their own funds. From September of this year to date, more than two hundred rooms have been built, with each room costing only 120 to 160 yuan. The people involved in building these houses are all family members of the employees, and their labor income has also solved their living difficulties.
