Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: The "Pravda" newspaper today published an editorial on the visit of Egyptian President's representative, Defense Minister General Amer, to the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet people are very happy to see the further development and consolidation of the sincere friendship and fruitful cooperation between the Soviet Union and Egypt.

	During the stay of the Egyptian delegation headed by General Amer in Moscow, talks were held with Soviet government leaders. The talks involved many issues of political and economic cooperation, as well as military issues. During the talks, the Soviet government, in order to take into account the wishes of the Egyptian government and Egyptian President Nasser, expressed its willingness to help Egypt develop its economy economically and technically. This assistance from the Soviet Union will be sincere and friendly, and will be based on respect for Egypt's national dignity and sovereignty.

	The editorial pointed out that the further development of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Egypt will be of great significance to solving the fundamental problems of Egypt's economic development. The Soviet state has always treated Egypt in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial economic cooperation.

	The editorial then pointed out that the United States is taking advantage of the poverty of the Eastern nations who have suffered from colonialism for a long time to shout about "aid" to these nations. However, the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" has not brought any economic benefits to the people of the Middle East, but only conspiracies and coups, death and destruction. The imperialist countries' attempts to impose an economic blockade on Egypt have also failed. Independent Eastern countries will always receive support and assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

	The editorial concluded by saying that the results of the Soviet-Egyptian Moscow talks have opened up new prospects for consolidating and developing the friendly relations and effective cooperation between the Soviet Union and Egypt. There is no doubt that this friendship and cooperation will help consolidate the cause of peace and security in the Middle East and the world.

    苏埃合作进一步巩固
    苏联“真理报”评论苏埃关系
    新华社莫斯科20日电　“真理报”今天就埃及总统代表、国防部长阿密尔将军访问苏联发表社论说，苏联人民非常高兴地看到苏联和埃及两国之间的真挚的友谊和富有成果的合作有了进一步的发展和巩固。
    以阿密尔将军为首的埃及代表团在莫斯科期间同苏联政府领导人进行了会谈。会谈涉及到政治和经济合作的许多问题以及军事问题。在会谈过程中，苏联政府为了照顾埃及政府和埃及总统纳赛尔的愿望，表示愿意在经济上和技术上帮助埃及发展经济。苏联的这种帮助将是真挚的和友好的，并且是建立在尊重埃及的民族尊严和主权的基础上。
    社论指出，苏埃两国经济合作的进一步发展，对解决埃及经济发展的根本问题将有重大的意义。苏维埃国家对待埃及一向是遵循着和平共处和互利的经济合作的原则。
    社论接着指出，美国利用过去长期受殖民主义压迫的东方各民族贫困的机会，大喊大叫要“援助”这些民族。可是，“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”并没有给中近东各国人民带来任何经济利益，只是带来了阴谋和政变，死亡和破坏。帝国主义国家对埃及实行经济封锁的企图也破产了。东方独立国家将永远会得到苏联和其他社会主义国家的支持和援助。
    社论最后说，苏埃莫斯科会谈结果给巩固和发展苏联同埃及的友好关系和有成效的合作打开了新的远景。毫无疑问，这种友谊和合作将有助于巩固中近东和全世界的和平和安全的事业。
