Recently, Anhui Province held a water conservancy conference. From the ideological problems criticized at the conference, it can be seen that many places have not yet fully grasped the policy of building water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily. Failure to solve this problem will have an adverse impact on water conservancy construction this winter and next spring.

Some places have not grasped the policy of diligently and thriftily building water conservancy projects when arranging water conservancy work. In the discussions at the Anhui Water Conservancy Conference, some comrades believed that since the development of agricultural production is currently emphasized, and large-scale water conservancy projects will be undertaken this winter and next spring, then the state must invest a lot in water conservancy, and this year's money must be obtained. Some comrades believed that since it is a "collective undertaking with public assistance," then as long as it is a water conservancy project undertaken by an agricultural cooperative, the state should provide financial subsidies. Therefore, at the beginning of the meeting, the idea of reaching out to the state for money was very prominent. Some comrades brought many large project plans, asking the state for money. FanChang County planned to add more than 4,000 horsepower of water pumps to solve the waterlogging problem of 85% of the county's waterlogged fields. The Baoda Embankment alone was planned to invest 1.3 million yuan. ShiDai County planned to only do 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork this winter and next spring, but asked the state to invest 100,000 yuan and loan 20,000 yuan. Huainan City invested a lot of money in water conservancy projects in the suburbs. At the provincial water conservancy conference, the city's representatives proposed an application for an investment of 700,000 yuan. According to the initial requirements put forward by various counties in the province, the state would have to invest more than 90 million yuan in small-scale farmland water conservancy alone this winter and next spring. Some counties even included projects that would not be done this year in the plan.

Many places emphasize the construction of large and medium-sized projects, focusing funding, technical forces, and cadres on individual projects while relaxing leadership over more small projects. Taihu, Chu County, and other counties concentrated their technical forces on small reservoirs, while for small projects such as ponds and dams, they believed that it would be enough for the Party committee to give an order, and there was no need to manage them much. GuiChi County needed to carry out some decentralized water storage projects to solve the flood control problem in the upper reaches of the QiuPu River. Eight cadres were sent to search for more than ten days, but they only found one project location, because they looked down on places where large projects could not be built. Many mountain ponds in QianShan County need to be renovated, but this county is looking for reservoir sites for small reservoirs everywhere, instead of renovating the existing mountain ponds.

Because of neglecting the role of small-scale farmland water conservancy, the initial plans for small-scale water conservancy this winter and next spring in many areas are generally conservative. Some people believe that ponds are repaired every year, and the pond mud is all dug out, so there is nothing to repair. A water conservancy section chief in Jing County said: "The mountainous area is either stone or wood, and there is nothing to do for water conservancy." Some counties plan to do two-thirds less earthwork this winter and next spring than last year.

After discovering these ideological problems, the leading organs of Anhui Province organized the participants in the water conservancy conference to study the relevant central documents and the provincial party committee's instructions. Combining study, they gave these problems to everyone for debate.

In the debate, many facts were presented to prove that it is wrong to adopt the method of the state taking over and investing more in farmland water conservancy, instead of relying on the masses. For example, the KangHe Dam project in QuanJiao County adopted the method of being hosted and contracted by the county. It took two years and cost 60,000 yuan, but it has not been fully completed, and the irrigation area is only 2,000 mu. On the contrary, the ShenShan Temple Reservoir in the county was subsidized by the government for only more than 4,000 yuan, and the agricultural cooperative relied on its own strength to collect materials such as stones. As a result, the project has been very effective, with an irrigation area of 3,000 mu, and 1,000 mu of dry land has been converted into paddy fields (with an increase of 400 jin per mu). The method of the state taking over and investing more money is not only inconsistent with the principle of diligently and thriftily building water conservancy, but also easily causes a misconception in the minds of agricultural cooperative members, as if it is not the state helping them to build water conservancy, but they are building projects for the government, so they want the state to give money for everything before taking action. For example, the ShuiMenTang Reservoir in the 71 Agricultural Cooperative in HuoQiu County, the government adopted the method of taking it over, and even the members of the cooperative had to pay the government for the place where the materials were piled. After the government took over the XiaoPai River irrigation and flood control project between LiuAn and HuoQiu, it had to pay agricultural cooperatives to repair the roads for transporting materials, and the efficiency of excavation was reduced by half compared with the general situation. These facts all show how harmful it is to not rely on the masses to build water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily.

In the debate, everyone also specifically calculated an account: This year's Anhui is a year of "bumper harvest with deficiencies." It is certain that the province will receive more than 23 billion jin of grain. Based on 23 billion jin, if 8% of the public accumulation fund is deducted, 18.4 billion jin of grain can be accumulated, which is equivalent to more than 100 million yuan. A large part of these public accumulation funds can be used for water conservancy construction. Some people only see the more than 90 million yuan they want from the state, but they do not see the potential of more than 100 million yuan in the masses. After presenting the facts and making detailed calculations in this way, they realized that the idea of simply relying on state investment is very wrong.

This meeting also criticized the idea of only paying attention to large-scale projects and neglecting small-scale projects. After discussion, everyone realized that whether or not a bumper harvest can be guaranteed next year depends to a large extent on whether a large number of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects that generate universal benefits can be built. Many facts prove that small-scale water conservancy plays a great role. FeiDong County has increased its guaranteed harvest area from 400,000 mu to more than 900,000 mu. The benefits of larger water conservancy projects benefiting more than 1,000 mu only account for 140,000 mu, and the rest depends on small-scale farmland water conservancy. FuXing Township in Chao County has implemented methods such as joint repair and management, ditching and water diversion, and linking ponds. These small-scale projects have increased the yield from an average of 270 jin per mu to 563 jin. WeiShan Township in XuanCheng has doubled its agricultural output due to the construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy. GangNan Cooperative in LangXi County has 15,000 mu of upland fields, 85% of which have become self-flowing irrigation, and more than 70% of the fields have fundamentally eliminated drought. This year's unit yield has increased from 230 jin before the construction of small-scale water conservancy to 500 jin. It can be seen that the idea of neglecting small-scale farmland water conservancy is divorced from reality.

As for the conservative ideas that small-scale water conservancy has been built to the top and there is nothing more to build, and that the masses have difficulty investing and cannot build a lot, these were also strongly criticized in the debate. Has small-scale water conservancy really been built to the top? Then why can't water be used to irrigate the fields and plant wheat in time when the weather is dry now? According to a survey in FeiDong County, only 50% of the runoff in the hilly area of the county is currently utilized, and most of the remaining water is lost. At present, the task of controlling waterlogging and drought in the plains is very heavy, and it is impossible to quickly do a good job of intercepting and storing runoff in mountainous and hilly areas, so there is no basis for saying that construction has reached its peak. This meeting also pointed out that of the 1.4 billion cubic meters of earthwork completed in water conservancy projects in the province since liberation, 800 million cubic meters (excluding the Huai River control) were completed only last year and this year after cooperativization, which shows that the potential for water conservancy construction after cooperativization is great. And Anhui had a bumper harvest this year, the masses have strength, the weather is dry after autumn, the pond water and the bottom water of the polder area are not large, and the cooperatives are more consolidated. The masses have improved their thinking after the great debate. With these favorable conditions, water conservancy construction should be pushed to a new climax. Some places have set their construction plans too low because they have underestimated the current situation.

After organizing the debate, the cadres of various counties participating in the meeting clarified their thinking and truly grasped the policy of relying on the masses to build water conservancy diligently and thriftily. By the end of the meeting, less money was requested, but the plan for water conservancy construction increased: the province plans to complete nearly 500 million cubic meters of earthwork this winter and next spring, exceeding the amount of projects constructed in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956, and the irrigated area to be increased and improved will reach more than 13 million mu. Because this was proposed on the basis of solving ideological problems, everyone's determination to complete this task has also increased.

    打破大兴水利的思想障碍
    本报记者　于明
    最近安徽省召开了水利会议，从会议上所批判的几个思想问题可以看出，不少地方对于兴修水利的方针还没有很好掌握。这个问题不解决，将会对今冬明春的水利兴修发生不良影响。
    有些地方在安排水利工作时，没有掌握勤俭办水利的方针。在安徽水利会议的讨论中，有的同志认为，目前既然强调发展农业生产，今冬明春要大兴水利，那末，国家在水利上的投资一定很多，今年的钱一定好要。有的同志认为，既是“社办公助”，那末，只要是农业社办的水利工程，国家就都应该在财政上给以补助。所以在开会之初，向国家伸手要钱的思想十分突出。有些同志带来许多较大的工程计划，要求国家给钱。繁昌县在计划中，准备增加抽水机四千多匹马力，以解决全县85％的内涝田地的内涝问题，单是一个保大圩，就准备投资一百三十万元。石埭县今冬明春计划只作十万个土方，就要求国家投资十万元，贷款两万元。淮南市对于郊区的水利工程投了大量资金，在省的水利会议上，这个市的代表又提出了投资七十万元的申请。根据全省各县最初提出的要求，今冬明春单是在小型农田水利上，就要国家投资九千多万元，有的县甚至把今年不做的工程也列入计划中去。
    不少地方强调兴修大中型工程，把经费、技术力量和干部都着重放在单位工程上而放松了对更多的小型工程的领导。太湖、滁县等县都把技术力量集中到了小水库上，而对塘坝等小型工程，则认为只要党委一号召就行，不一定多管。贵池县为了解决秋浦河上游的防洪问题，需要做一些分散蓄水工程，派了八个干部寻找十多天，只找到了一处工程的位置，因为不能兴建大工程的地方，他们都看不上眼。潜山县很多山塘需要改造，但是，这个县却到处寻找小水库的库址，而不去改造旧有的山塘。
    因为忽视小型农田水利的作用，所以不少地区最初制订的今冬明春小型水利的计划一般都较保守。有的人认为，年年修塘，塘泥都挖光了，没有什么修头。泾县的一个水利科长说：“山区不是石头就是木头，没有什么水利可搞的。”有的县今冬明春计划要作的土方，竟比去年减少了三分之二。
    安徽省领导机关发现这些思想问题后，便组织参加水利会议的人学习了中央有关文件和省委指示，并结合学习，把这几个问题交给大家辩论。
    在辩论中，摆出了许多事实证明，在农田水利上，采取国家包下来，多投资，而不依靠群众的做法，是错误的。如全椒县康河坝工程，就采取了由县里主持包办的办法，修了两年花了六万元，还没有全部完成，灌溉面积只有二千亩。相反，该县沈山寺水库，政府只补助了四千多元，石料等都依靠农业社自己的力量去凑集，结果这个工程效益很显著，灌溉面积达三千亩，光旱地改水田就有一千亩（每亩增产四百斤）。国家包下来多投资的办法，不但和勤俭办水利的原则不符合，而且容易使农业社社员的思想上产生错觉，似乎不是国家在帮助他们修水利，而是他们在为政府修工程，所以处处要国家给钱才行动。如霍丘县七一农业社的水门塘水库，政府采取了把它包下来的办法，连堆材料的地方，社员们都要政府给钱。六安霍丘之间的小渒河灌溉防洪工程，政府包下来后，让农业社修修运料的道路都得给钱，而挖土方效率又比一般降低了一半。这些事实都说明了，在目前，不依靠群众勤俭办水利的做法，是多么有害。
    在辩论中，大家还具体算了一笔账：今年安徽是“丰中有歉”的年景，全省收二百三十亿斤以上的粮食是有把握的，就以二百三十亿斤来算，如果按照扣8％的公积金，就可积累十八亿四千斤粮食，合一亿多元。这些公积金有很大一部分是可以用于水利建设的。有些人只看到向国家要的那九千多万元，却看不到群众中一亿多元的潜力。经过这样摆事实、算细账以后，他们认识到了单纯依赖国家投资的思想是十分错误的。
    这次会议对于只重视大型工程、轻视小型工程的思想，也进行了批判。大家经过讨论，认识到明年能不能保证大丰收，在很大程度上是决定于能否建设成大量的、普遍发生效益的小型农田水利，有许多事实证明，小型水利的作用很大。肥东县，现在保收田亩已由四十万亩增加到九十多万亩，其中受益一千亩以上的较大水利工程发挥的效益只有十四万亩，其余都靠小型农田水利。巢县复兴乡因为实行联合修管、开沟引水、联塘并塘等办法，这些小型工程使产量由每亩平均二百七十斤提高到了五百六十三斤。宣城围山乡因为兴修小型农田水利，农业产量提高了一倍。郎溪县岗南社一万五千亩岗田，已有85％变成了自流灌溉，有70％以上的田从根本上消灭了旱灾，今年的单位产量已由兴修小型水利前的二百三十斤提高到了五百斤。可见忽视小型农田水利的思想是脱离实际的。
    至于那种认为小型水利已经兴修到顶，再没有什么可修；群众投资困难，修不了很多等的保守思想，在辩论中也受到了有力的批判。小型水利真的修到顶了吗？那为什么在现在天气干旱的时候，有水却不能及时浇地种麦呢？据肥东县的调查，该县丘陵区的径流直到现在还只利用到50％，其余大部分的水都流失了。现在平原治涝治旱的任务很大，山区丘陵单是拦蓄径流的工作也不可能很快作好，所以，说兴修到顶的话毫无根据。这次会议还指出，解放以来全省完成的水利工程量十四亿土公方中，只在合作化后的去年和今年即占八亿方（治淮除外），可见合作化后兴修水利的潜力很大。而安徽今年丰收，群众有力量，秋后天干，塘水、圩区的底水都不大，又加以合作社更加巩固，群众在大辩论后思想提高，有了这些有利条件，正应该把水利兴修推向新的高潮；有些地方把兴修计划定得很低，是由于对目前形势估计不足。
    经过组织辩论，参加会议的各县干部澄清了思想，真正掌握了依靠群众勤俭办水利的方针。到会议最后，钱要的少了，而兴修水利的计划却增加了：全省今冬明春要作的土方近五亿，超过1955年冬和1956年春兴修工程的数量，要增加和改善的灌溉面积达一千三百多万亩。因为这是在解决思想问题的基础上提出的，大家完成这个任务的决心也大了。
