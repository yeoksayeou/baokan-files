    Gifts from Nanjing Machine Tool Plant
    On the 26th, the state-owned Nanjing Machine Tool Plant sent a set of exquisite wooden molds of the hexagonal lathe's feed gearbox to the Moscow Machine Tool Casting Plant.
    This wooden mold is a gift from the employees of the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, and also a gift to thank the Soviet experts.
    Several years ago, when they were manufacturing wooden molds, their work efficiency was low and the quality was not high because they did not have process drawings, which often caused rework and waste.
    Soon, a Soviet casting expert came to the wooden mold workshop. He asked the workers what kind of drawings they used to make wooden molds. The workers replied, "We have always used the part processing drawings to make wooden molds." The expert looked at the wooden mold and said, "This method is not good." He casually opened his bag and took out a wooden mold process drawing, and pointed to it, saying, "Using this kind of drawing can improve work efficiency." He gave this wooden mold process drawing to the factory.
    The wooden mold workshop learned from this advanced Soviet experience and gradually established the wooden mold process, and the quality of the wooden molds quickly improved. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 南京机床厂的礼品

    南京机床厂的礼品
    国营南京机床厂在26日把一套精致的六角车床走刀齿轮箱的造型木模寄往莫斯科机床铸件厂。
    这件木模是南京机床厂职工们庆祝十月革命四十周年的礼品，同时也是感谢苏联专家的礼物。
    几年以前他们在制造木模的时候，因为没有工艺图纸，工作效率低，质量不高，经常造成返工浪费。
    不久，有一位苏联铸工专家来到了木模工段。他问工人用什么图纸制造木模。工人回答说：“我们一直是用台件加工图纸做木模。”专家看看木模说：“这种方法不好”，他随手拉开皮包拿出一份木模工艺图纸，并且指着说：“用这种图纸，工作效率就可以提高。”他把这份木模工艺图纸送给了厂里。
    木模工段学习了苏联这项先进经验，逐步建立了木模工艺，木模质量迅速提高了。　（据新华社讯）
