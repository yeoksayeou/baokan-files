Based on extensive airing of views and great rectification, the first batch of thirty-five agricultural cooperatives undergoing rectification in Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, have launched a high tide of major rectification and improvement. Now, improvements have been made wherever they are urgently needed and feasible.

The members of these thirty-five agricultural cooperatives put forward nearly 20,000 opinions during the airing of views. Among them, opinions on the leadership style of cadres and on production and financial management accounted for more than 60%. During the rectification, each agricultural cooperative first resolved to make improvements in these two aspects. Regarding the leadership style of cadres, the cadres of the thirty-five cooperatives and teams not only participated in production themselves but also led production through participation. For example, He Shungeng, the captain of the third team of the second cooperative of Chengbei Township's Ma Jing, used to get up late in the morning, and the cooperative members wasted a lot of time waiting for him to assign farm work. Now, the captain arranges the team's production every evening after production and takes the cooperative members to the fields early the next morning. Cadres of the Zhongqiao First Cooperative in the Sixth and Eighth Township used to have a floating style of work, and many problems in production could not be discovered and solved in time, but now they have also changed.

During the rectification, each cooperative also carefully cleared financial accounts based on the opinions of the members and seriously dealt with cases of cadres' embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds. During the extensive airing of views, members of the Chaoxi Cooperative in Maqiao Township revealed that the cooperative accountant, Gao Yinan, built a small house last year and wanted to build a large house this year, and his father often went to the streets to drink, and it was unknown where the money came from. The working group immediately established an accounting investigation team and mobilized the masses to settle the accounts. It was found that the head of the cooperative, Huang Kaiyuan, the cooperative accountant, Gao Yinan, and others had collectively embezzled and used 917 yuan of public funds. After the investigation, these cadres made confessions at the members' meeting, handed over some of the cash on the spot, and made a repayment plan, guaranteeing to pay it off within the year. The members were very satisfied with this handling.

In addition, each cooperative paid attention to improving production management in a timely manner during the rectification, thereby effectively promoting production. In some production teams of the Ma Jing Second Cooperative, the work point quotas were very chaotic. In order to grab work points, the cooperative members affected production, so the cooperative cadres went to the production teams and studied and adjusted the work point quotas with the cooperative members, which boosted the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members. The labor efficiency of the third team has increased by two times.

The extensive airing of views in agricultural cooperatives also promoted the rectification of rural economic enterprises. Members of the Zhongqiao First Cooperative reflected in the airing of views that the Gaoqiao Supply and Marketing Cooperative was unfair when selling oil and sugar, and the grain management office opened late in the morning and took a break at noon, which was very inconvenient for farmers. These opinions were quickly accepted by the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative and the grain management office, and they immediately improved their service attitude and work schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 24th. The sixteen agricultural cooperatives in Zhaodu Township, Jintang County, Sichuan Province, have launched a production upsurge on the basis of the great debate on the two roads, combined with rectification work and a great debate on production.

Although the whole township has achieved a bumper harvest this year, with a grain increase of more than 200,000 catties, phenomena such as improper labor allocation, disregard for quality in production, chaotic financial management, and cooperative cadres not going deep into leading production are still common in various cooperatives. In order to plug these loopholes, everyone actively came up with ideas and suggestions during the debate. More than 50 opinions put forward by members of the Kangle Cooperative have been improved in more than 20 cases. Based on the masses' criticism of not paying attention to orchard management, the Zhongxing Second Cooperative Committee timely convened a symposium for fruit farmers to rectify the orchard team. Guo Wan'en, the director of the Zhonghe Second Cooperative, used to borrow cash at will without going through the cooperative members, which caused widespread dissatisfaction among the masses; now all major expenses are submitted to the cooperative members for discussion and approval. The members are all satisfied and said: Now we know the bottom line of the cooperative.

The leadership's determination and facts in improving work have greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for production. At present, 432 mu of vacant land have been eliminated, the wheat fields have been plowed three times, and the quality of sowing has also been generally improved.

    在大鸣大放的基础上进行大整大改
    靖江一批农业社掀起整改高潮
    四川金堂赵渡乡农业社整改生产紧密结合
    本报讯　江苏靖江县第一批整风的三十五个农业社，在大放大鸣的基础上，掀起了一个大整大改的高潮，现在，凡是急需要改而又有可能改的都已作了改进。
    这三十五个农业社的社员，在鸣放中提出了近两万条意见。其中对干部领导作风及生产财务管理上的意见就占60％以上。整改中，各农业社首先下决心从这两方面作了改进。关于干部领导作风方面，三十五个社的社队干部不仅自己参加生产，而且从参加生产中来领导生产。如城北乡马静二社三队队长何顺庚过去早上起身迟，社员每天等他分配农活就浪费了很多时间，大农活赶不上做完就天黑了。现在队长每天在生产后当晚就安排好队内的生产，第二天一早就带社员下地了。六八乡中桥一社干部过去作风漂浮，生产上许多问题不能及时发现和解决，现在也有了改变。
    整改中各社还根据社员意见认真清理了财务账目，严肃地处理了干部贪污挪用公款的事件。马桥乡朝西社社员在大放大鸣中揭发社会计高一南去年砌小屋，今年又想砌大屋，他父亲常上街喝酒，不知钱从哪里来。工作组立即成立了查账小组，发动群众结清账目，果然查出了社长黄开元、社会计高一南等集体贪污动用公款九百一十七元的事实。查明后，这些干部都在社员大会上作了交代，当场交出现款一部，并订了归还计划，保证年内还清。社员对这样处理都非常满意。
    此外，各社在整改中，都及时注意了生产管理上的改进，因而有效地推动了生产。马静二社有些生产队里工分定额很乱，社员干活为了抢工分，影响了生产，社干部便深入生产队，和社员逐项研究调整了工分定额，鼓舞了社员的生产热情。三队的劳动效率提高了两倍。
    农业社的大鸣大放同时还推动了农村经济企业部门的整改。中桥一社社员在鸣放中反映高桥供销社卖油卖糖时不公平，粮管所早上开门迟，中午还要休息，对农民很不方便。这些意见很快为供销社和粮管所的干部所接受，而且立即改进了服务态度和作息制度。　（刘鸿桢）
    本报讯　四川省金堂县赵渡乡十六个农业社，在两条道路大辩论的基础上结合整改工作进行了生产大辩论，掀起了生产高潮。
    全乡今年虽然获得了丰收，粮食增产二十多万斤；但劳动调配不当、生产不顾质量、财务管理混乱、社干部不深入领导生产等现象各社仍普遍存在。为堵塞这些漏洞，在辩论中，大家都积极想办法，提建议。康乐社社员提的五十多条意见，已改了二十多件。中兴二社社委会根据群众对不重视果树管理的批评，及时召开了果农座谈会，整顿了果树小组。中和二社主任郭万恩，原来不通过社员随便借支现金，引起群众普遍不满；现在凡重大开支都交社员讨论通过。社员都满意地说：这下我们才清楚社的家底啦。
    领导上改进工作的决心和事实，大大鼓舞了群众的生产积极性。目前，已消灭空闲地四百三十二亩，麦地已翻犁了三道，播种质量也普遍提高。
