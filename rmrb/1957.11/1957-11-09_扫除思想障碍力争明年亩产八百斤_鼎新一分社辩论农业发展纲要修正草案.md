Eliminate Ideological Obstacles and Strive for 800 Jin per Mu Next Year
Dingxin First Branch Debates Draft Revised National Agricultural Development Program

(Reported by our correspondent Zhen Weimin) In order to implement the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) in an agricultural cooperative, it is necessary to first launch a mass campaign of airing views, blooming, and a big debate to eliminate all ideological obstacles, so that the broad masses can recognize the direction of this revolutionary program to transform China's countryside, and everyone can work hard, strengthen their confidence, and strive to achieve the forty articles. This is an experience gained by the Dingxin First Branch of Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, in debating the first fourteen articles of the Agricultural Development Program.

After the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) was published, the cooperative convened a meeting of its members on the afternoon and evening of October 29 to conduct a debate. The central issue of the debate was: Can the average annual grain yield per mu reach 800 jin, and how can this target be achieved?

The Dingxin First Branch is only twelve li away from the north bank of the Yangtze River and is a surplus grain cooperative in the pure grain producing area along the river. In 1956, in accordance with the spirit of the Draft National Agricultural Development Program, the cooperative had made preliminary plans to achieve a grain yield of 800 jin per mu within two or three years, catching up with the 737 jin per mu requirement of the twenty-seven well-to-do middle peasant households in the cooperative. This plan greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the members. Although the cooperative suffered from waterlogging in 1956, it still achieved a bumper harvest, with a grain yield of 670 jin per mu, and an average grain yield of 720 jin per mu for the third team.

After the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) was published, it brought greater encouragement to all members, and was first supported by a majority of cooperative cadres. With the help of the township party committee and the work team stationed in the cooperative, they proposed a preliminary plan to achieve a grain yield of 800 jin per mu next year, and made some efforts to improve the quality of autumn planting, plant more green manure (rice seedlings), and accumulate more farmyard manure. However, a few people had right-leaning conservative ideas. They said: "The forty articles were talked about in 1956, but without commercial fertilizer, the planned is just empty talk!" Thus, a heated debate was triggered at the members' meeting.

At the meeting, well-to-do middle peasants Wang Yongshan and others said: "Farming depends on the Heaven's will. It is not possible to reach 800 jin per mu by relying on guarantees alone." The issue of relying on Heaven or relying on people aroused interest among everyone, and a debate was launched. Poor peasant Chen Mingde said: "Labor is better than Heaven. Last year, during the big flood, all the rice in our cooperative was submerged, but by relying on people to drain the water, we still harvested five to six hundred jin per mu." Ju Mingde, the captain of the third team, said: "Wang Yongshan is my field neighbor. My private plot and his private plot were divided from a single piece of land. The soil quality and fertility are about the same. This year, we both planted buckwheat and radishes. However, when there was a drought some time ago, he had the time to carry water to fight the drought, while I was busy with meetings and production within the team, and didn't go to water the land. As a result, my crops turned yellow, while his crops were green. Wang Yongshan, tell me, is this relying on people or relying on Heaven?"

More than twenty people participated in the debate on this issue. The discussion concluded that: to strive for large-scale increase in production, first rely on people, second rely on capital, and third also rely on the weather. After the debate, everyone initially established the confidence that man can conquer nature, fight against natural disasters, and strive for a yield of 800 jin per mu.

Then, well-to-do middle peasants Liu Zifeng, Wang Genbao, and others raised another issue: "Everyone has confidence in increasing production to 800 jin, but we are afraid that the state will still require us to eat only 430 jin of grain per capita. If all the increased grain is handed over to the government, isn't it just working for the government for nothing?" Some people said: "This year is the third year of implementing the Three Fixes policy, I am afraid the government will change the grain policy." Some members believed: "The government should set a fixed standard, and it would be best to purchase according to the standard. If all the increased production belongs to ourselves, the enthusiasm of the masses will be even higher." Tang Shaogui, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, first explained the state's grain policy, saying: "The state's policy of unified purchase and sales of grain will not change. This year, according to the actual situation, a policy of making up for deficiencies with surpluses has been proposed, and 40% of the surplus production will be purchased. This will also not change. We should trust the government, the increase in production is for us, and we will not suffer losses." Poor peasant Tang Fajian said: "In years of good harvests, we should sell more grain to support the country's industrial construction and our disaster-stricken compatriots. This is what we should do. In years of disasters, if there is no increase in production, the state will not purchase grain. This is the state taking care of us farmers. It is unreasonable to set a fixed standard. Moreover, the state purchases surplus grain, which is also 'taken from the people and used for the people.' With money, the state can create more new-style farm implements and chemical fertilizers to sell to us." At the meeting, everyone also calculated the accounts: according to the Three Fixes, 40% of the surplus production will be purchased. If each mu reaches a yield of 800 jin, each person can be allocated 589 jin of grain, while the state will only purchase 211 jin.

After resolving these ideological problems, the members' enthusiasm for increasing production increased significantly. At the meeting, each team reported their preliminary plans to strive for 800 jin next year. Many members also expressed their determination at the meeting, stating that this plan is reliable and not just empty talk. Even well-to-do middle peasant Wang Genbao expressed his determination. However, well-to-do middle peasant Liu Zifeng still raised the issue that there is not enough pig feed, and the number of pigs will have to be reduced this winter. What to do? Wang Yongshan also raised the fertilizer issue, with no confidence in accumulating fertilizer, believing that "It would be best if the government supplied us with some fertilizer powder and bean cake." Xu Guowen, a well-to-do middle peasant who had achieved a yield of 800 jin per mu on a small area during the individual farming period, also said: "The main reason why my land was able to increase production in the past was that I used eight pieces of bean cake per mu." Poor peasant Zhang Maocai said in his speech: "Using eight pieces of bean cake per mu, even a child can farm, that doesn't count as skill." Tao Fajian said: "The state is going to develop the chemical industry, but at present we only have so much fertilizer powder. If you want it and he wants it, it will never be enough. We rely on commercial fertilizer and will not be able to guarantee 800 jin next year." Female member Chang Yufang also said: "To solve the fertilizer problem, we still have to rely on our local methods: dredging mud from the river, raising pigs on the ground, planting green manure, and picking leaves from the trees. In the debate on how to ensure that the number of pigs will not decrease, Wang Genbao, who was originally ideologically conservative, became an active member in persuading others. He said: "If the number of pigs does not decrease now, it will not decrease in the future. At present, the radishes have grown to a foot high, and everyone can plant more beets now, and more amaranth can be planted next spring. Moreover, the current increase in production includes pig feed, and the fertilizer is reasonably priced, who would still fuss about the feed problem?"

This members' meeting actually became a mobilization meeting for the entire cooperative to launch a winter production upsurge and strive for a bumper harvest next year. A new production upsurge is gradually forming in the cooperative.

The cooperative will continue to discuss the other articles of the Agricultural Development Program.

    扫除思想障碍力争明年亩产八百斤
    鼎新一分社辩论农业发展纲要修正草案
    本报讯　记者甄为民报道：在一个农业社里贯彻全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），必先发动社员大鸣大放大辩论，才能扫除一切思想障碍，使广大群众认清这一改造中国农村的革命纲领的方向，人人努力、坚定信心，为实现四十条而努力。这是江苏省靖江县鼎新一分社在辩论农业发展纲要前十四条得到的一点体验。
    当农业发展纲要修正草案公布以后，这个社便于10月29日下午和晚上召开社员大会进行辩论，辩论中心问题是：每亩平均年产粮能不能达到八百斤，如何实现这一指标。
    鼎新一分社离开长江北岸只有十二里，是沿江纯粮产地区的一个余粮社。1956年根据全国农业发展纲要草案的精神，这个社曾进行过初步规划，争取在两三年内达到每亩产粮八百斤，赶上该社二十七户富裕中农亩产七百三十七斤的要求。这个规划大大鼓舞了社员的生产积极性，1956年虽遭涝灾，仍然获得了丰收，亩产粮达六百七十斤，三队平均每亩产粮达七百二十斤。
    全国农业发展纲要修正草案公布以后，给全体社员带来了更大的鼓舞，首先得到多数社干部的拥护。他们在乡党委和驻社工作组的帮助下，提出了争取在明年达到亩产粮食八百斤的初步规划，并在提高秋种质量、多种绿肥（秧草）、多积农家肥料等方面作了一些努力。可是少数人却存在着右倾保守思想。他们说：四十条1956年就谈过，没有商品肥料，订了计划还不是空口说白话！于是，在社员大会上，就引起了一场热烈辩论。
    会上，富裕中农王永山等说：种田要靠天老爷做主，光靠保证不能达到八百斤。大家对靠天还是靠人的问题引起了兴趣，展开了一场辩论。贫农陈明德说：“劳力胜于天，去年大水灾，我们社里稻子全部被淹，但依靠人排水，结果每亩还收到五、六百斤。”三队队长鞠明德说：王永山是我的田邻，我的自留田和他的自留田是一块田分出来的，土质、肥瘦却差不多，今年种的也都是荞麦、萝卜。可是前些时天旱，他有功夫挑水抗旱，我忙于开会和队内生产，没有去浇水抗旱，结果我的庄稼发黄，他的庄稼碧绿。王永山，你说说看，这是靠人还是靠天。
    参加这个问题辩论的有二十多人，讨论结果一致认为：争取大面积增产、一靠人，二靠本，三也要靠天时。经过辩论，大家初步树立了人定胜天，向自然灾害作斗争，争取亩产八百斤的信心。
    接着，富裕中农刘子凤、王根保等人又提出了一个问题：“增产到八百斤大家都有信心，就是怕国家还要我们吃四百三十斤口粮。增产的粮食都要交给政府，还不是替政府白忙。”有的人说：“今年是实行三定政策第三年，恐怕政府要改变粮食政策。”有的社员认为：“政府应该订一个死标准，照标准收购最好。增产的部分全部归自己，群众的积极性就会更高。共青团支部书记汤少桂首先解释了国家的粮食政策，他说：“国家的统购统销政策是不会变的，今年又根据实际情况提出了以丰补歉的政策，超产部分征购40％，这也是不会变的。我们应该相信政府，增产是为了我们，不会叫我们吃亏”。贫农唐发鉴说：丰收年成我们多卖一些粮食，支援国家工业建设和灾民同胞，这是应该的；碰到灾年，没有增产，国家就不要增购的粮食了。这是国家照顾我们农民，标准订死了不合理。况且，国家收购了余粮，也是“取之于民，用之于民”。国家有了钱，可造成更多的新式农具、化学肥料卖给我们。会上，大家又算了一笔账：按三定的超产部分增购40％计算，每亩若达到八百斤的产量，每人就可以分到五百八十九斤粮食，而国家只征购二百十一斤。
    在解决了这些思想问题以后，社员的增产积极性显著地提高了。会上，各队都报告了他们争取明年达到八百斤的初步打算，许多社员也在会上表示决心，说明这个规划是可靠的，不是空口说白话。甚至富裕中农王根保也表示了决心。但是，富裕中农刘子凤仍然提出猪饲料不够，今年冬天猪子还要减少。怎么办？王永山也提出了肥料问题，对积肥没有信心，认为“最好政府是供给我们一些肥田粉和豆饼。”单干时小面积达到八百斤产量的富裕中农徐国文也提出：“过去我的地所以能够增产，主要就是靠一亩田下八块豆饼。”贫农张茂才发言说：“一亩田下八块豆饼，小孩子也会种田，这不算本领。”陶发鉴说：“国家是要发展化学工业的，但目前我们只有这么多的肥田粉，你也要他也要，总是不够的，我们靠商品肥料明年保证达不到八百斤。”女社员常玉芳也说：“解决肥料问题，目前还是要靠我们的土办法：河里罱泥，地上养猪、种绿肥，树上摘树叶等。在辩论怎样保证生猪不会减少的问题上，原来思想保守的王根保却成了说服别人的积极分子。他说：“猪子现在不减少，将来就不会减少。目前，罗卜已经长到尺把高了，现在大家还可以多种甜菜，明春可以多种苋菜。何况现在的增产幅度，猪饲料也安排在内，肥料折价又合理，谁还去闹饲料问题”。
    这次社员大会，实际上成了全社掀起冬季生产高潮，争取明年全年丰收的一个动员会。一个新的生产高潮正在该社逐渐形成。
    这个社还将继续讨论农业发展纲要的其他各条。
