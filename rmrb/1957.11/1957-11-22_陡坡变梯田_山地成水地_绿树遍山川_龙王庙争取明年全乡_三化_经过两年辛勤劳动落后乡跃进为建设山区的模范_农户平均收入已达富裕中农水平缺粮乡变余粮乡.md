Our newspaper's Shaanxi Shangluo special dispatch: In the arduous labor of building the motherland's mountainous areas, a village filled with strong will has erected a heroic banner in the depths of the Qinling Mountains in Shangluo Prefecture, Shaanxi Province. This is Shang County's Longwangmiao Township, which has leaped from a backward township to a model township. After only two years of effort, it has fundamentally changed its impoverished and backward state. This year, it overcame a severe drought, and the township's total income still exceeded last year's. The average total income of each farming household has reached the level of local prosperous middle peasants. Since November, inspired by the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program, the people of the township are launching an even more vigorous water conservancy, terracing, and afforestation campaign. After preliminary research, the township's responsible comrades confidently propose: Strive to achieve greening, terracing, and irrigation throughout the township next year!
	Longwangmiao Township is located more than forty li northeast of Shang County, in the rolling hills of the Qinling Mountains. The township is full of rocky mountains, and 88.5% of the arable land is on slopes, generally with a slope of forty to fifty degrees. Originally, the land was very barren, soil erosion was severe, and the cultivated area shrank year by year. Before liberation, under the cruel exploitation of landlords, usurers, warlords, and bureaucrats, "peeling off the skin and draining the oil, fertile mountains became skinny bones," and the people of the township lived a poor life of "eating looking at shadows and sleeping looking at stars." After liberation, the bandit forces of the evil landlords entrenched themselves in the deep mountains. Although they had been suppressed many times, they still operated in secret. Therefore, the land reform movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the township were not carried out thoroughly. It was not until the Shangluo Prefecture began the movement to transform backward townships in the spring of 1955 that the people of the township completely eliminated the reactionary forces. In October of that year, primary cooperatives were established on the basis of 60% of mutual aid teams being merely formalistic. In the spring of 1956, with high tides following high tides, the entire township was completely collectivized, establishing eight advanced cooperatives (now fifteen). After heatedly discussing the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)," it formulated a seven-year plan for building the mountainous area and launched a large-scale production movement. Men, women, old, and young in the township locked their doors and went up the mountains, building more than a thousand mu of terraces and planting more than ten thousand mu of trees in ten days, grasping the main key to increasing grain production in mountainous areas - soil and water conservation. Later, it changed from extensive planting and low yields to intensive farming and meticulous work. In this way, the people of the township began to change the barren land, so that the total grain output of the township in 1956 reached 1,670,529 jin, an increase of more than 350,000 jin compared with 1955, an increase of 26%. The township has a total of 1,084 households, 4,539 people, and 9,594 mu of cultivated land, and in one year it changed from a grain-deficient township to a grain-surplus township.
	From last autumn to this spring, the people of the township launched an even larger-scale terracing and water conservancy movement. They newly built 1,085 mu of terraces and 35 irrigation canals, turning more than 730 mu of slopes into irrigated land. In this autumn's fight against drought, they built another 21 irrigation canals, expanding the irrigated area by more than 370 mu. In this movement, the tenacious fighting spirit of the township's masses in overcoming difficulties was fully demonstrated.
	In the terracing struggle, the township masses' battle slogan was "Make the stones move, let the land turn over"; on the steep slopes of forty to fifty degrees, they used drills to set off explosives, moved stones, and filled in soil, building flat terraces one by one. The sixth team of the Qixing Cooperative spent more than 100 workdays on the north slope blasting a stone larger than a room, and used the blasted stones to build a stone embankment four and a half chi high, three chi wide, and thirty-two zhang long. The team finally built twenty-seven mu of terraces on the north slope, so that "corn grew thick and long on the mountain slopes where even wolves wouldn't [go] to [shit]." The female members of the third team of the cooperative, when building terraces in Miaoyuan, in order to remove all the stones on half a mu of large stony beach, carried the large ones, carried the small ones, and picked up the broken ones, and did not rest even though their hands were worn out. In this way, the male and female members of the cooperative moved the stones on this stony beach and built an eighteen-zhang-long stone embankment two zhang five chi high and six chi wide at the top. They also filled a mountain gully more than two zhang wide and more than two zhang deep, connecting two small pieces of slope land into one, turning it into a terrace of more than six mu.
	In the water conservancy struggle, the township masses broke the traditional idea that water conservancy cannot go to high mountains, and launched three consecutive marches to the high mountains. The Qixing Cooperative conducted a large-scale water conservancy debate in the struggle against drought and planting wheat. Everyone finally unanimously agreed that "of the thirty-six plans, building canals is the first." Their action slogan was: "All members of the cooperative are mobilized, find water sources in all directions, irrigate one more mu is one more mu, plant one day earlier is one day earlier, water conservancy is built on the mountains, and water irrigates fields all over the mountains." When they built the Mapo East Canal, they blasted open a stone cliff more than 100 zhang long, and in more than 20 days, they built a canal more than 380 zhang long, diverting water around three mountain ridges, irrigating more than 70 mu of land, and planting wheat in time.
	This autumn, there was a drought, and the corn also suffered a hailstorm. In the situation where grain production was generally reduced in the surrounding areas, the township's grain production still increased by more than 76,000 jin compared with last year. This year, the township still has a surplus of more than 25,000 jin of grain. Among the fifteen cooperatives, five cooperatives have a surplus of grain, eight cooperatives are self-sufficient, and only two cooperatives lack a portion of grain. In addition to the income from the township's twenty-three kinds of forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production, this year the township's total income is 257,999.40 yuan, with an average income of 57.30 yuan per person (last year the average income per person was 43.80 yuan, 35.60 yuan in 1955, and 33.50 yuan in 1954). This greatly exceeds the average income of 30 yuan per person in the entire Shangluo Prefecture this year, enabling the average masses of the township to reach the level of local prosperous middle peasants.
	After the promulgation of the revised draft of the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program, while enthusiastically discussing the plan for terracing and water conservancy this winter and next spring, the township made preliminary plans for the fighting goals for next year. The county originally estimated that the township could expand terraces by 400 mu this winter and next spring. After the township studied it, it was initially determined to be 1,000 mu. After discussions by the directors of each cooperative and after research with 49 elderly people, the total number proposed by each cooperative has reached 1,775 mu. After completing this task, the area of slope land transformed into terraces in the cooperative will increase from 28.9% to more than 50%. According to the preliminary research of the township's leaders, it is planned that another 3,000 mu may be expanded in the autumn and winter of next year, which can reach more than 80% of the slope land being transformed into terraces, realizing the terracing of slope land throughout the township. In terms of water conservancy construction, after repeated discussions and multiple improvements to the plan by the members, it was decided to newly build 49 irrigation canals this winter, expanding the irrigated area by 1,012 mu, and dig 59 water storage ponds, irrigating 407 mu of land. After completion, together with the previous ones, there will be a total of 105 irrigation canals, with a total of 2,539 mu of irrigated land, making 26% of the township's cultivated land into irrigated land, so that each household has an average of 2.3 mu of irrigated land. They plan to use the method of extending old canals and building new canals next year to fully utilize the role of water sources on and below the mountains, and may expand irrigated land by more than 4,000 mu, making more than 70% of the township's cultivated land into irrigated land, realizing the task of water conservancy of cultivated land.
	In terms of afforestation, the township originally had more than 25,000 mu of forest land. In the past two years, it has closed off mountains for afforestation for more than 16,700 mu, and planted trees for more than 12,400 mu, accounting for 89% of the suitable afforestation area. This autumn, the Shangluo Prefectural Committee called on each household to plant one sheng of walnuts. The township actively responded. This spring and autumn, the township has already planted an average of 1.4 sheng per household. They plan that after one year of hard work next year, they can achieve the task of greening the entire township.
	Due to the rapid progress of the township in planting trees, building terraces, and building canals and dams, soil and water conservation work has achieved significant results. The heavy rain that lasted for several days starting on June 16 this year caused a mountain flood that was much larger than in 1954, but crops and houses were not damaged, while in 1954, 103 mu of crops were completely washed away, 695 zhang of dikes were washed away, and 16 houses were damaged. In previous years, after heavy rain, the water in the Shijiu River, which runs through the township, would be turbid for three or four days, but now, after heavy rain, it clears up on the same day or the next day. Therefore, after terracing, irrigation, and greening are achieved by next year, the township will basically overcome floods and droughts.
	This year, the average yield per mu in the township is 182 jin, an increase of 42.8% compared with 1954 before collectivization (104 jin per mu). While paying attention to building terraces and water conservancy, the township also pays attention to raising cattle and pigs to increase fertilizer, which is another important reason for the township's increased production. The cooperative has increased from 1,435 cattle and 85 pigs in 1954 to 2,170 cattle and 1,501 pigs this year. Next year, with a large increase in terraces and irrigated land, if the amount of fertilizer can be greatly increased, the yield per unit area can be greatly increased. At present, the township relies entirely on people carrying manure to the high mountains. Farmers have no other draft animals besides cattle, and local cattle have never had the habit of carrying goods, so the responsible cadres of the township are considering how to train cattle to carry large amounts of fertilizer to the high mountains. If it can be done, they also plan to raise the originally planned average yield per mu from 180 jin this year to 250 jin next year, and then raise it further. Therefore, the originally planned target of increasing the average income per person to 75 yuan next year will also be increased accordingly.
	Longwangmiao Township is a typical township for building mountainous areas directly cultivated by the Shangluo Prefectural Committee and the Special Office. The working group jointly formed by the Prefectural Committee and the Special Office has been working in the township since the transformation of backward townships in 1955. The comrades of the working group eat, live, and work with the masses, which has played a positive role in promoting the work of the township. However, more attention should be paid to the training of local cadres. At the same time, the development level among the cooperatives in the township is still very uneven. How to make the backward cooperatives catch up with the advanced cooperatives is a particularly noteworthy issue in improving the work of the township. (Attached picture)

    陡坡变梯田　山地成水地　绿树遍山川
    龙王庙争取明年全乡“三化”
    经过两年辛勤劳动落后乡跃进为建设山区的模范
    农户平均收入已达富裕中农水平缺粮乡变余粮乡
    本报陕西商雒专讯　在建设祖国山区的辛勤劳动中，一个充满着坚强意志的乡村，在陕西省商雒专区的秦岭深山中，竖起了英雄的旗帜，这就是由一个落后乡跃进为模范乡的商县龙王庙乡。该乡经过短短两年的努力，已经从根本上改变了穷困落后的面貌，今年又战胜了严重的旱灾，使全乡总收入仍然超过去年，今年每户农户的平均总收入已经达到当地富裕中农的水平。11月份以来，该乡人民在农业发展纲要四十条的鼓舞下，正展开着劲头更大的兴水利、修梯田和植树造林运动，该乡负责同志经过初步研究，很有信心地提出：争取明年在全乡实现绿化、梯田化和水利化！
    龙王庙乡离商县城东北四十多里，处于秦岭的丛山峻岭中，全乡石山林立，88．5％的耕地都是坡地，一般坡度四五十度，原来土地十分贫瘠，水土流失严重，耕地面积年年缩小。解放前在地主、高利贷者和军阀官僚的残酷压榨下，“剥开肉皮抽干油，肥山变成瘦骨头”，该乡人民过着“吃饭看影影，睡觉看星星”的穷苦日月。解放后，恶霸地主的土匪武装盘据深山，虽经多次清剿，仍然暗中活动，因而该乡的土地改革运动和镇压反革命运动都进行得很不彻底，直到1955年春季商雒专区开始改造落后乡运动以后，该乡人民才彻底肃清了反动势力。当年10月在60％的互助组流于形式的基础上建立了初级合作社，1956年春，高潮接高潮，全乡完全合作化，成立了八个高级合作社（现为十五个），并在热烈讨论“全国农业发展纲要草案”以后，作出了建设山区的七年规划，掀起了大生产运动。该乡男女老少锁门上山，十天之内就兴修了梯田千多亩和植树造林一万多亩，抓着了山区增产粮食的主要关键——水土保持。以后更改变了广种薄收为精耕细作。这样该乡人民就开始改变了贫瘠的土地，使1956年全乡粮食总产量达到一百六十七万零五百二十九斤，比1955年增加三十五万多斤，提高26％。该乡共一千零八十四户，四千五百三十九人，耕地九千五百九十四亩，一年就由缺粮乡变为余粮乡。
    从去秋到今春，该乡人民展开了规模更为巨大的修梯田和兴水利运动。又新修梯田一千零八十五亩，修水渠三十五条，使七百三十多亩坡地变为水地。今秋抗旱斗争中，又修水渠二十一条，扩大灌溉面积三百七十多亩。在这一运动中充分表现了该乡群众战胜困难的顽强的战斗精神。
    在修梯田斗争中，该乡群众的战斗口号是“使石头搬家，让土地翻身”；在四五十度的陡坡上，打钎放炮，搬石填土，修成了一块一块的平整梯田。七星社六队在北坡上花了一百多个劳动日炸碎了一块比一间房还要大的石头，把炸碎的石头修成了一道四尺五高、三尺宽、三十二丈长的石埝。该队终于在北坡修成二十七亩梯田，使“狼都不（去）拉（屎）的山坡长出了又粗又长的玉米”。该社第三队的女社员，在庙塬修梯田时，为了搬净半亩大石滩上的石头，大的抬、小的担、碎的拾，手都磨烂了也不休息。这样，该社男女队员把这块石滩上的石头搬了出来，修成了高二丈五、上宽六尺的十八丈长的石埝，他们还填了一个两丈多宽、两丈多深的山沟，使两小块坡地连成一片，变成一块六亩多的梯田。
    在修水利斗争中，该乡群众打破了水利不能上高山的传统思想，一连发动了三次向高山进军。七星社在抗旱种麦的斗争中进行了水利大辩论，大家终于一致认为“三十六条计，修渠是第一”。他们行动的口号是：“全社社员总动员，四面八方找水源，多浇一亩是一亩，早种一天是一天，水利修上山，遍山水浇田”。他们在修麻坡东渠时，炸开了一百多丈长的石崖，在二十多天中，修成一条三百八十多丈长的水渠，引水绕过了三个山岭，灌溉了七十多亩地，及时种上了麦。
    今年秋季天旱，玉米又遭到了一场大冰雹，在周围各地区粮食普遍减产的情况下，该乡粮食仍然比去年增产七万六千多斤。今年全乡仍余粮二万五千多斤，十五个社中五个社余粮，八个社自给，只有两个社缺一部分粮。加上该乡二十三种林业、牧业和副业生产的收入，今年全乡总收入二十五万七千九百九十九元四角，每人平均收入五十七元三角（去年每人平均收入四十三元八角，1955年三十五元六角，1954年三十三元五角）。大大超过全商雒专区今年每人平均三十元的收入，使全乡群众平均达到当地富裕中农的水准。
    在全国农业发展纲要四十条修正草案公布以后，该乡在热烈讨论今冬明春的修梯田、兴水利计划的同时，对明年的奋斗目标作出了初步规划。县上原来估计该乡今冬明春可扩大梯田四百亩，乡上研究后初步确定为一千亩，经过各社主任讨论、经过和四十九位老人研究后，各社提出的总数已达一千七百七十五亩。完成这一任务后，该社坡地变梯田的面积，就由28．9％增至50％以上。据该乡负责人初步研究，计划明年秋冬两季，可能再扩大三千亩，就可达到80％以上的坡地变为梯田，实现全乡坡地梯田化。在水利建设方面，经过社员反复讨论和多次提高计划，决定今冬新修水渠四十九条，扩大灌溉面积一千零一十二亩，挖涝池五十九个，浇地四百零七亩，完成以后，连以前总共有水渠一百零五条，共有水地二千五百三十九亩，使全乡耕地26％变为水地，使每户平均有水地二亩三分。他们计划明年用延长旧渠和修新渠的办法，充分发挥山上山下水源的作用，可能再扩大水地四千多亩，使全乡耕地70％以上成为水地，实现耕地水利化的任务。
    在植树造林方面，该乡原有林地二万五千多亩，两年来封山育林一万六千七百多亩，植树造林一万二千四百多亩，已占宜林面积89％。今年秋天，商雒地委号召每户种一升核桃，该乡积极响应，今年春秋两季该乡每户已经平均种一升四合。他们计划经过明年一年的努力，就可达到绿化全乡的任务。
    由于该乡在植树、修梯田和修渠筑坝方面的迅速进展，水土保持工作已收到显著效果。今年6月16日开始一连几天的大雨，山洪比1954年大得多，但庄稼和房屋都未受到损失，而1954年却完全冲毁了一百零三亩庄稼，冲垮了堤埝六百九十五丈，冲坏了十六间房。往年大雨后，横贯该乡的石鸠河河水要混浊三四天，现在大雨以后，当天或者第二天就清了。因而到明年梯田化、水利化和绿化以后，该乡将在基本上战胜水灾和旱灾。
    今年全乡平均亩产一百八十二斤，比合作化前的1954年（亩产一百零四斤）提高42．8％。该乡在注意修梯田兴水利的同时，也很注意养牛养猪增加肥料，这也是该乡增产的另一个重要原因。该社已由1954年的一千四百三十五头牛和八十五头猪增加到今年的二千一百七十头牛和一千五百零一头猪。明年梯田和水地大量增加，如果肥料能大量增加，单位面积产量还可大大提高。目前该乡送粪上高山全靠人背，农民除牛以外又没有其他力畜，而当地牛从来没有驮运的习惯，所以该乡负责干部正打算如何训练用牛把大量的肥料驮上高山。如果能办到，他们还打算把原定明年平均亩产由今年的一百八十斤提高到二百五十斤的计划，再向上提高。因而明年原计划每人平均收入增加到七十五元的指标，也将相应提高。
    龙王庙乡是商雒地委和专署直接培养的建设山区的典型乡，地委和专署合组的工作组从1955年改造落后乡起，一直在该乡坚持工作。工作组的同志同群众同吃同住同劳动，对该乡工作起了积极的推动作用。但对当地干部的培养还应更加注意。同时该乡各社之间发展水平还很不平衡，如何使后进社赶上先进社，就是使该乡工作提高一步中特别值得注意的问题。（附图片）
