In Tokyo, more than 20,000 people held the "Japan大会 of World United Action for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons" at the Hibiya Park Open-Air Concert Hall. The Hibiya Park Open-Air Concert Hall was packed, and thousands more people were unable to squeeze in outside the hall. Thirty representatives of atomic bomb victims from Hiroshima and Nagasaki also came to participate in the conference.

    The conference passed a resolution demanding that the UN General Assembly immediately adopt a resolution on the unconditional conclusion of an agreement prohibiting the testing of nuclear weapons, and make every effort to mitigate the danger of atomic warfare occurring in Asia and Africa. The resolution demanded that the UN General Assembly designate countries that use nuclear weapons as enemies of humanity.

    The conference also passed a resolution demanding that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union immediately and unconditionally conclude an agreement prohibiting the testing of nuclear weapons, and cease implementing all nuclear weapons testing plans.

    The conference passed a resolution demanding that the Japanese government, in accordance with the content of the "Tokyo Declaration" adopted by the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Japan-India Joint Statement, submit a proposal to the UN General Assembly for the immediate and unconditional prohibition of nuclear weapons testing; demanding that the Japanese government conclude an agreement with the United States not to bring nuclear weapons into Japanese territory; and demanding that the Japanese government revise the Atomic Bomb Victims Medical Law into a Victims and Family Support Law.

He said that with the power of the Japanese people and the power of the people all over the world, we will urge the United Nations to work hard to achieve an immediate and unconditional prohibition of nuclear weapons testing. Yasui Kaoru strongly criticized the Japanese government's attitude towards the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and called on all Japanese people to unite and urge the Japanese government to listen to the appeals of the conscience of the Japanese people and the people of the world, and immediately submit a proposal to the UN General Assembly demanding the immediate and unconditional prohibition of nuclear weapons testing.

    Tanaka Minoru, a member of the Diet from the Japan Socialist Party, Miyamoto Kenji, a representative of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Yoshida Takashi, managing director of the Japan Fisheries Association, and representatives from Okinawa all spoke at the meeting.

The conference also sent representatives to the embassies of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in Japan, submitting requests calling for the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing.

    According to the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, today marks the largest movement since the launch of the anti-nuclear weapons movement. According to Kyodo News, 7,000 postcards and 400 telegrams have been sent to the United Nations, requesting the conclusion of an agreement prohibiting the testing of nuclear weapons. 300,000 people in Japan have already signed petitions calling for a ban on nuclear weapons testing.
