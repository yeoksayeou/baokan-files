    Sino-Soviet Combat Friendship on the Cultural Front
    ——Recollections of Working at the "Soviet Business" Era Publishing House
    Lin Ling
    The Soviet Union has always been unfailingly helpful to the Chinese people. From 1941 until Liberation, during our most difficult periods under enemy puppet rule and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Soviet comrades helped us operate the Era Publishing House to publish newspapers and books under the name of "Soviet Business," which is a good example of the Sino-Soviet combat friendship.
    Shortly after the August 13th Shanghai War in 1937, the Chinese army withdrew, and Japanese troops and puppet troops surrounded the Shanghai concessions, which were like isolated islands. Chinese newspapers and periodicals (except those run by traitors) had to use the names of countries such as Britain, the United States, and France in order to maintain publication. However, for the sake of convenience in work, they had to avoid any contact with Soviet comrades.
    In June 1941, Hitler's Germany attacked the Soviet Union, and Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union stood on the same front against Fascist Germany and Italy. This created conditions for Soviet people to publish Chinese publications. Because the British publisher who worked for us at that time was bought over by the Japanese puppets, many publications led by the Party were forced to cease publication. We discussed this matter with Comrade Rogov, the head of TASS in Shanghai at that time, who was in charge of Soviet propaganda work. We used the name of the Russian "Era" magazine, which had already been launched in Shanghai, to publish a Chinese "Era" weekly magazine starting from August 20th. Although the content of "Era" magazine was biased towards reporting on the Soviet Union, such publications were still very much needed to expand readership.
    In this way, the "Era" weekly began as a starting point for the Soviet Union to help us carry out revolutionary cultural propaganda during the most difficult years, namely the concession, enemy puppet rule, and Kuomintang rule.
    The "Era" weekly developed into the Era Publishing House. In addition to the Chinese "Era" weekly, it also published the "Soviet Literature and Art" monthly magazine from the 25th anniversary of the October Revolution in 1942, and the "Era Daily" and "Soviet Medicine" monthly magazine from 1945. In addition, it also published the Russian "Era" bi-monthly magazine and the English "Daily War Bulletin." During the war, it also published pamphlets in English, German, and Japanese. After Japan's surrender in 1945, it published a large number of Soviet literary works and books introducing various aspects of the Soviet Union.
    On December 8, 1941, Japanese imperialism launched the Pacific War, and Japanese troops entered the concessions, ending the concession era in Shanghai. All Chinese newspapers and periodicals published in the name of foreigners in the past were suspended. However, in order to ensure its southward invasion and have no worries, Japanese imperialism temporarily adopted a friendly policy towards the Soviet Union, and the Era Publishing House, which was the least liked by the Japanese imperialists, was still able to exist in this gap.
    The continued publication of the Chinese "Era" magazine played an extremely beneficial role in providing spiritual food to the general public when enemy puppet publications dominated Shanghai and the people of Shanghai could not know the true situation of the world. What was reported in the "Era" magazine was not only the true situation on the Soviet-German battlefield, but also a detailed reflection through literary works, features, and communications of how the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, launched the heroic struggle of "everything for the front, everything for victory" in all corners of the front and rear. "Era" magazine and "Soviet Literature and Art" opened a window in Shanghai and the entire Southeast occupied area, which were under the blockade of news and bloody rule by the Japanese puppets, and reported the real situation to the Chinese people.
    Soviet comrades showed a lofty spirit of internationalism in order to ensure the publication of these Chinese publications. Soviet comrades came forward to negotiate with the Japanese and Wang puppet authorities, and Chinese comrades were only responsible for internal translation work. Later, when the Japanese puppets wanted to check all Chinese publications, Soviet comrades personally sent the manuscripts for inspection and "negotiated" with the Japanese puppet inspectors. When Chinese work comrades were persecuted or arrested, Soviet comrades came forward to negotiate and tried their best to rescue them.
    Under the dark oppression of the enemy puppets, publications like "Era" could not rely on social contributions to maintain themselves, and ordinary people did not dare to contact the Era Publishing House's editorial department, which was monitored by the enemy puppets.
    Most of the manuscripts for "Era" had to be translated from Russian, but there were very few people in Shanghai who understood Russian at that time. This meant that on the one hand, we had to try our best to find people who could translate Russian, and on the other hand, we had to be determined to cultivate new translation forces in our work. We had to have our own compilation and translation team to cope with the situation at that time.
    Ordinary printing houses did not dare to typeset and print the Era Publishing House's publications, and the environment was complicated. We also did not dare to rely on printing houses in society casually. The binding work was also the same.
    At that time, the distribution work in Shanghai was controlled by the forces of a gang, which not only had very high distribution discounts, but was also politically unreliable. Ordinary bookstores did not dare or were unwilling to sell the Era Publishing House's books and periodicals on consignment. These situations forced us to arrange our own distribution channels and open our own bookstores. These situations added to the difficulty of publishing red publications in Shanghai at that time.
    The difficulty of paper was also a serious problem. After 1945, Soviet ships could sail to Shanghai, and the paper was mainly shipped directly from the Soviet Union. Before that, it was purchased from the market by various means.
    "Era" and other publications were publicly distributed, and all newsstands in Shanghai sold them, and each issue was quickly sold out. There was also a special situation in this regard: there were not many fixed subscribers, and most readers bought them at newsstands. Because under the rule of the enemy puppets and the Kuomintang, readers were like frightened birds and were unwilling to leave their names and addresses in dangerous red agencies, lest they become blacklisted. Readers would rather buy them at newsstands temporarily, and after reading them, they would send them to others to read. They would not keep them at home as much as possible to avoid accidents. This created another effect: one publication was circulated and read, and the scope of readers became wider and wider.
    "Era" was not only sold in Shanghai, but also far away to many other cities under the rule of the enemy puppets at that time. It was not only spread in the enemy puppet areas, but also sold to the liberated areas in northern Jiangsu, eastern Zhejiang, and other places.
    The newly hung wartime map of the Soviet-German war at the entrance of the Era Publishing House, with red threads and small red flags indicating the battle lines, moved every day, attracting countless people who cared about the current situation. Especially in the morning, a large group of people always gathered at the entrance of the publishing house, which was another propaganda role played by the publishing house.
    In the days when the Japanese puppet newspapers shamelessly published the "remarkable achievements" of the imperial army and the German and Italian fascist armies, readers who wanted to know the truth could only come here to see some reliable news. Moreover, a very simple but also extremely powerful logic dominated the citizens of Shanghai at that time: Japan was an ally of Germany and Italy, and seeing the failure of Germany and Italy was also seeing the defeat of the Japanese army.
    In February 1944, when the Soviet army was winning victories and the Chinese people were faintly happy with the news of victory, the Japanese imperialists instructed their puppets to order the "Era," "Soviet Literature and Art," and "Daily War Bulletin" to be suspended, leaving only the Russian publications to continue publishing. The reason was that Soviet people could only publish Russian publications in foreign countries and could not publish newspapers and periodicals in other languages.
    The Soviet and Chinese comrades of the Era Publishing House, who were encouraged by the news of victory, saw that the happy days of celebrating victory were just around the corner. Although they could not publish books and periodicals, they still worked as usual every day, translating Soviet literary works, accumulating manuscripts, and waiting for the dawn.
    In April 1945, when the Soviet Union had already invaded Germany and was approaching Berlin, "Era" and "Soviet Literature and Art" were automatically republished. In addition, the "Soviet Medicine" monthly magazine was also added.
    In August, the Japanese army surrendered, and Shanghai began the era of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang. We were still under the protection of the Soviet flag and immediately published the "Era Daily." From then on, the Soviet comrades' help to the Chinese comrades had shifted from reporting Soviet news to comprehensively reporting Chinese and international news. It was also because the daily newspaper had to contact reality that conflicts with the Kuomintang authorities increased, and the number of things that Soviet comrades came forward to negotiate also increased. After all the progressive newspapers and periodicals in Shanghai, such as "United Evening News" and "Wen Cui" magazine, were banned, "Era Daily" was still able to persist for a period of time under the special relationship of "Soviet Business." When large-scale struggles such as "anti-American aid to Japan," "anti-hunger," and "anti-civil war" were launched by workers and students in Shanghai, "Era Daily" carried out real reports, which played a powerful role in propaganda among the masses. After the start of the Liberation War, the "Bi-weekly Military Review" in the newspaper reported on the war situation and analyzed the situation, which played a great role in enabling the general public to understand the real situation of the Liberation War. But precisely because of this reason, in June 1948, "Era Daily" was ordered to be suspended by the Kuomintang authorities on the grounds of "distorting military information, inciting labor and student unrest, and undermining finance."
    After the daily newspaper was banned, publications such as "Era" magazine and "Soviet Literature and Art" continued to be published until Liberation. After the Japanese surrender, "Era" magazine was changed to a semi-monthly publication, focusing on introducing the Soviet people's construction of socialism and communism, and was a comprehensive international affairs publication. "Soviet Literature and Art" was the earliest Chinese publication dedicated to translating Soviet literary and artistic works. A total of thirty-seven issues were published in the eight years before and after, almost publishing all the important works of the Soviet Patriotic War period. These works not only inspired the Chinese people who were engaged in the War of Resistance Against Japan, but also the fighting spirit of Soviet writers and artists who each took out their own weapons to truly "do everything for the front, everything for victory" provided a clear example for Chinese literary and artistic workers to learn from.
    With the help of Soviet comrades, the Era Publishing House cultivated a large number of excellent translators who directly translated literary and artistic works from Russian in the ten years, and are now scattered in important positions in various literary and artistic publications and literary and artistic publishing houses.
    At the end of 1952, after completing its glorious combat mission, the Era Publishing House was transferred by the Soviet side to the Chinese people as the publishing institution of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and a large number of books introducing the Soviet Union were translated and published. Although the Era Publishing House has changed its working direction, its work during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, the lofty internationalist spirit of the Soviet people, and the combat friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people on the cultural front will remain indelible in the memory of the vast number of Chinese readers.

    文化战线上的中苏战斗友谊
    ——回忆“苏商”时代出版社的工作
    林陵
    苏联向来是无微不至地帮助中国人民的。从1941年到解放，在我们工作最艰难的敌伪统治时期和国民党反动统治时期，苏联同志用“苏商”的名义帮助我们经营时代出版社出版报刊书籍，是表现中苏战斗友谊的一个很好的例子。
    1937年八·一三上海战争发生后不久，中国军队撤退，日本军队和汉奸伪军包围了形同孤岛的上海租界。中国报刊（除了汉奸经办的之外）为了能够维持出版，都借用英、美、法等国的招牌。但是，为了工作上的方便，却不得不避免和苏联同志有什么往来。
    1941年6月，希特勒德国进攻苏联，英、美和苏联站到了一条战线上反对法西斯德国和意大利。这就产生了可以由苏联人出面出版中文刊物的条件。因为当时给我们做发行人的英国人被日伪收买过去，党所领导的许多刊物都被迫停刊了，我们就和当时在上海主持苏联宣传工作的塔斯社社长罗果夫同志商量此事。就用当时在上海已经创刊的俄文“时代”杂志的名称，自8月20日起出版一份中文的“时代”周刊。虽然“时代”杂志的内容，偏于苏联情况的报道，但对于扩大读者，这样的刊物还是很需要的。
    就这样，“时代”周刊作为一个开端，开始了苏联帮助我们在最艰难的岁月，即租界、敌伪统治和国民党统治时期进行革命的文化宣传工作。
    由“时代”周刊发展成为时代出版社，除出中文的“时代”周刊外，还从1942年十月革命二十五周年起出版“苏联文艺”月刊，1945年起出版“时代日报”和“苏联医药”月刊。另外还出版俄文的“时代”半月刊，英文的“每日战讯”。在战争时期还出版英、德、日文的小册子。1945年日本帝国主义投降后，出版了大量苏联文艺作品和介绍苏联各方面情况的书籍。
    1941年12月8日日本帝国主义发动太平洋战争，日军开入租界，结束了上海的租界时期，所有过去用外国人名义出版的中文报刊，一律停刊。但是日本帝国主义为了保证南侵和没有后顾之忧，暂时对苏联采取了友好政策，最不为日帝所喜欢的时代出版社仍能在这个缝隙里存在下去。
    中文“时代”杂志的继续出版，在敌伪刊物独霸上海、上海人民无法知道世界真实情况的时候，给广大读者发挥了极为有益的精神食粮的作用。“时代”杂志上所报道的，不仅是苏德战场上的真实情况，并通过文艺作品、特写、通讯等形式详尽地反映了苏联人民怎样在共产党领导下在前后方各个角落里所展开的“一切为前线、一切为胜利”的英勇斗争。“时代”杂志和“苏联文艺”在日伪封锁消息、实行血腥统治的上海以及整个东南沦陷区里，像开了一个窗户，把真实的情况报道给中国人民。
    苏联同志为了保证这些中文刊物的出版，表现了崇高的国际主义精神。一切由苏联同志出面同日本和汪伪方面进行交涉，中国同志只管做内部的编译工作。后来日伪要检查全部中文出版物，也由苏联同志亲自把稿子送去检查，同日伪检查官“蘑菇”。中国工作同志被迫害或逮捕时，苏联同志就出面去交涉，竭力设法营救。
    在敌伪压迫暗无天日的情况下，像“时代”这样的刊物是无法依靠社会组稿来维持的，一般人也不敢和受到敌伪监视的时代社编辑部往来。
  “时代”的大部分稿子要从俄文翻译，而上海当时懂俄文的人很少，这就一方面必须尽量搜罗能够译俄文的人，另一方面要下决心在工作中培养新的翻译力量。自己必须有一个编译的班子，才能应付当时的环境。
    一般印刷所不敢排印时代社的刊物，而且环境复杂，我们也不敢随便依赖社会上的印刷所。装订工作也是如此。
    发行工作，当时在上海是被一种帮会的势力控制着的，非但发行折扣很高，而且政治上很不可靠。一般书店不敢或不愿代售时代社的书刊。这些情况就迫使我们不得不自己来安排一套发行机构，并开设自己的书店。这些情况都加重了当时在上海出版红色刊物的困难。
    纸张的困难，也是一个严重问题。1945年之后，苏联轮船可以开到上海，纸张主要是从苏联直接运来的，在这以前是用各种方法到市面上去收购。
    “时代”等刊物是公开发行的，上海全市各报摊都有出售，每出一期，很快就销售一空。这方面也有一种特殊情况：固定的定户并不多，读者大多数是在报摊上零买的。因为在敌伪和国民党统治之下，读者犹如惊弓之鸟，不愿意把自己的姓名地址留在危险的红色机关里，以免一旦变成黑名单。读者宁可临时在报摊上买，看过之后转送给别人看，尽可能自己不保留在家里，以免发生意外。这样就产生了另外一种作用，一份刊物辗转传阅，读者范围愈扩愈大。
      “时代”不仅销售在上海市，也远销到当时敌伪统治下的许多其他城市。不仅在敌伪地区里传布，也销售到苏北、浙东等解放区里。
    时代社门口新挂的苏德战时地图，上面用红丝线和小红旗表示战线，每天移动，吸引了无数关心时局的人，特别是早晨，出版社的门口，总集结着一大堆人，这是出版社所起的另外一种宣传作用。
    在日伪报纸无耻地登满皇军和德意法西斯军队“赫赫战果”的日子里，想要知道实情的读者，只有到这里来看到一点可靠的消息。而且一个极其简单但也是极其有力的逻辑支配了当时上海的市民：日本是德意的同盟者，看到德意的失败，也就是看到日军的败绩。
    就在1944年2月，苏军节节胜利，中国人被胜利的消息鼓舞得隐隐高兴的时候，日帝指使它的傀儡勒令“时代”、“苏联文艺”、“每日战讯”停刊，只留下俄文刊物继续出版。理由是苏联人只能在外国出版俄文刊物，不能出版其他文字的报刊。
    被胜利的消息鼓舞着的时代社的苏联同志和中国同志，眼看庆祝胜利的欢乐的日子就在面前，虽然不能出版书刊，但每天仍旧照常工作，编译苏联文艺作品，积累稿子，等候天亮。
    1945年4月，当苏联已经攻入德国境内并进迫柏林的时候，“时代”和“苏联文艺”等都自动复刊了。并且还增出了“苏联医药”月刊。
    8月，日军投降，上海开始了国民党反动统治时代，我们仍旧在苏联旗帜的保护之下，立即出版了“时代日报”，从此，苏联同志对中国同志的帮助，已从报道苏联的消息转入全面地报道中国的和国际的消息了。也正因为日报必须接触现实，同国民党当局的冲突就增加起来了，因而由苏联同志出面折冲交涉的事情也更加多起来了。在上海所有进步的报刊如“联合晚报”、“文萃”杂志等被封之后，“时代日报”仍能在“苏商”的特殊关系下坚持一个时期。当上海展开工人学生“反美扶日”、“反饥饿”、“反内战”等大规模斗争时，“时代日报”进行了真实的报道，在群众中起了有力的宣传作用。解放战争开始后，报上的“半周军事述评”，报道战况，分析战局，在使广大读者了解解放战争真实情况方面，起了很大的作用。但也正因为这个缘故，1948年6月间“时代日报”被国民党当局以“歪曲军情、煽动工潮学潮、破坏金融”等罪名勒令停刊了。
    日报被封后，“时代”杂志和“苏联文艺”等刊物仍继续出版，直到解放。“时代”杂志在日寇投降后改成半月刊，以介绍苏联人民建设社会主义、共产主义情况为主，是一个综合性的国际问题刊物。“苏联文艺”是中国最早的一份专门译载苏联文学艺术作品的刊物，前后八年，一共出版了三十七期，几乎发表了苏联卫国战争时期的所有重要作品。这些作品非但鼓舞了正在进行抗日战争的中国人民，而且苏联作家艺术家的那种各自拿出自己擅长的武器来真正做到“一切为前线、一切为胜利”而服务的战斗精神，使中国文艺工作者得到了鲜明的学习的榜样。
    在苏联同志的帮助下，时代社在十年的时期中，培养出一大批直接由俄文翻译文艺作品的优秀翻译，现在正分散在各个文艺刊物和文艺出版社的重要岗位上担任工作。
    1952年底，时代出版社在完成了自己光荣的战斗任务之后，由苏联方面移交给中国人民，作为中苏友好协会的出版机构，大量翻译和出版介绍苏联情况的书籍。现在时代出版社虽然改变了工作方针，但它在抗日战争和解放战争时期所做的工作，苏联人民的崇高的国际主义精神和中苏两国人民在文化战线上的战斗友谊，将永久不可磨灭地留在广大中国读者的记忆里。
