Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 8th. The Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has obtained a new antibiotic from soil in China that has an inhibitory effect on malignant tumors (cancer). Initial animal experiments suggest that its therapeutic effect is good.

The currently available drugs in the world that can inhibit some cancers include Actinomycin C from West Germany, Actinomycin J from Japan, and Actinomycin A and D from the United States.

In order to find our own strains that can produce anti-cancer substances, researchers in the Antibiotics Research Department of the Institute of Materia Medica have traveled to southern provinces for two years, collecting more than 4,000 soil samples. From a strain obtained from Guilin soil - Black Actinomyces - they extracted a new antibiotic now named Actinomycin K. Biological tests and chemical analysis have found that it has similar properties to Actinomycin C from West Germany, which is used to treat lymphomas and other cancers, but the chemical composition is somewhat different, making it a new species from a chemical point of view.

Scientists injected seeds of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (a highly toxic tumor) into the abdominal cavity or subcutaneously of 138 mice, causing the mice to develop tumors. Then, they injected Actinomycin K, and the growth of tumors in these mice was generally inhibited, and their lives were extended. When Ehrlich ascites carcinoma seeds treated with Actinomycin K were injected into 97 mice, none of them developed tumors. The results of toxicity tests in which large amounts of Actinomycin K were injected into mice and cats showed that there were no changes in these animals' blood, breathing, etc.

In all these experiments, comparisons were made with foreign Actinomycins. It was found that Actinomycin K has a slightly higher therapeutic effect and slightly lower toxicity than Actinomycin C from West Germany. The laboratory yield is more than ten times higher than Actinomycin C, and it is easy to ferment and extract, making it easy to carry out industrial production. The therapeutic effect of Actinomycin K is much higher compared to Actinomycin A and D from the United States.

The Institute of Materia Medica plans to conduct further research on this new antibiotic, testing its efficacy against sarcoma (another type of malignant tumor) in large rats, and testing its toxicity in large animals.

Responsible persons from the Shanghai First Medical College Tumor Hospital, antibiotic experts, and scientists from the Institute of Materia Medica recently held a meeting to discuss the research on Actinomycin K, believing that it has the potential to become an effective anti-cancer agent.

In addition, Fujian Normal University has also extracted an antibiotic substance that has an inhibitory effect on tumors. The results of pharmacological tests at the Institute of Materia Medica found that its therapeutic effect is slightly worse than Actinomycin K, and its toxicity is about twice as high as the latter.

    科学工作者在桂林土壤中找到一种新抗生素
    放线菌素K——对癌症有抑制作用
    新华社上海8日电　中国科院药物研究所从我国土壤中得到了一种对恶性肿瘤（癌）有抑制作用的新抗生素。从初步的动物试验看来，它的疗效良好。
    目前世界上现有的能抑制一部分癌症的药物有西德的放线菌素C、日本的放线菌素J、美国的放线菌素A和D。
    为了寻找我国自己的能够产生抗癌素的菌种，药物研究所抗生素的研究人员们两年来跋涉南方各省，搜集到的土种在四千种以上。他们从桂林土壤里得到的菌种——黑化放线菌，提取到现在已定名为放线菌素K的一种新抗生素。在生物试验和化学分析中发现它和西德的用于治疗淋巴癌等癌症的放线菌素C性质相似，化学成分却有些不同，从化学上说是一个新种。
    科学家们将艾氏腹水瘤（一种毒性很大的肿瘤）的种子注射到一百三十八只小老鼠的腹腔或皮下，使小老鼠生瘤，然后再注射放线菌素K，结果这些小老鼠身上瘤的生长，一般都受到抑制，它们的生命延长了。把经过放线菌素K处理的艾氏腹水瘤种子注射到九十七只小老鼠体内，它们都未生瘤。将放线菌素K大量注射到小老鼠和猫身上进行毒性试验的结果，发现这些动物的血液、呼吸等都没有发生变化。
    在所有这些试验中，曾和国外的放线菌素进行了比较。发现放线菌K比西德的放线菌C疗效稍高，毒性略低，实验室产量则高出放线菌C十倍以上，而且它发酵容易、提取简单，便于进行工业生产。放线菌K的疗效与美国的放线菌素A、D相比，高得更多。
    药物研究所准备对这种新抗生素作进一步的研究，在大老鼠身上试验它对肉瘤（另一种毒瘤）的疗效，在大动物身上试验它的毒性。
    上海第一医学院肿瘤医院负责人、抗生素专家和药物所的科学家最近开会对放线菌素K的研究进行了讨论，认为它有希望成为有效的抗癌素。
    另外，福建师范学院也提取到一种对肿瘤有抑制作用的抗生素物质，在药物研究所进行药理试验的结果，发现它的疗效比放线菌素K稍差，毒性比后者约大一倍。
