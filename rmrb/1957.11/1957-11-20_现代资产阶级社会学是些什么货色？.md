What Kind of Stuff is Modern Bourgeois Sociology?
Zhu Wushan

The anti-Party and anti-socialist scientific programs of Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, and others are components of the bourgeois political program of the Zhang-Luo alliance rightists. And the restoration conspiracy of bourgeois sociology by people like Fei Xiaotong and Wu Jingchao is part of the reactionary scientific program. They collude with each other, acting deceitfully, to carry out their anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies in an attempt to restore capitalism. Despite what Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, and their ilk say about the new sociology being based on historical materialism, and that the restoration of sociology is to do some work for socialist construction, their purpose is nothing more than to restore bourgeois sociology.

According to its original definition, sociology is the study of the general laws of human social development, and Marxists do not oppose this discipline. However, bourgeois sociology, from Comte and Spencer onwards, is mainly based on idealism to study society. The major schools of bourgeois sociology that prevailed most widely in the 17th and 18th centuries, such as Vico's theory of historical cycles and Rousseau's social contract theory, could not detach themselves from the exploitative social system. In other words, until the emergence of true sociology by Marx and Engels, the old idealist sociologists did not correctly understand that all social phenomena are interconnected and have certain laws of development. Later, the so-called sociologists of the general bourgeoisie went even further, openly defending monopoly capital and trying every means to save the dying capitalist system. Take the Third International Congress of Sociologists held in Amsterdam in 1956 as an example. The vast majority of bourgeois sociologists, when discussing social changes in the 19th century, did not mention the most fundamental issues that caused social changes in the 20th century, such as the class contradictions of capitalism, the emergence of the socialist system, the increasing bankruptcy of imperialist colonial policies, and the increasing upsurge of national liberation movements. Their attention was limited to some minor phenomena, such as some insignificant reforms in bourgeois legislation, and some insignificant changes in labor, education, family, religion, and marriage. They attempted to explain the social changes of the 20th century with these phenomena. Examining the actions of bourgeois sociologists based on the materials from this international congress, we can see the true motives of Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, and others in wanting to restore bourgeois sociology.

At this congress, bourgeois sociologists, each with their own specialized investigations, made all sorts of wild statements, truly varied and confusing. In general, the philosophical and sociological views of these bourgeois sociologists are mainly based on positivism and pluralism. For example, when M. Ginsberg talked about the facts of social change, he divided some facts that can cause social change into four categories for research. Therefore, he can only explain social change with plural facts. This cannot fundamentally solve the problem, because it cannot explain which facts are primary and which are secondary. That is, it cannot explain the following question: are the material conditions of society primary, or is human consciousness primary? M. Davy and A. Luzzatto reported on "Law and Social Change." A. Luzzatto proved that law is one of the most valuable things supporting society or the ruling power of society, and is the main tool for realizing social change. According to his meaning, judges and administrative officials are often "conscious or unconscious creators of social change, because they can interpret laws and create laws by virtue of their power, without the permission of the majority of the people or the approval of the legislative body." We also acknowledge the positive role of law, but we believe that law is not the primary social fact, but, like government agencies and all other political, legal, and social superstructures, is built on a certain economic foundation. Therefore, when affirming the creative role of law, it is necessary to first use scientific methods to explain the origin, change, and development of law itself. Professors of social science J. Vernay and P. Anger reported on "Moral Problems and Social Change," and they both believed that morality exists independently in society. Professor Anger opposed Marx's point of view, did not recognize that production relations often play a decisive role, and that the use of morality is only its manifestation. P. Anger denied the decisive role of human production and material relations in the development of social law, morality, and all spiritual life, obliterated the issue of the class nature of morality in class society, promoted that morality has a unified meaning in class society, and affirmed that morality can play a decisive role in changing society. May I ask: if morality can play a decisive role in changing society, then why has the morality of Christianity promoted loving one's parents and elders for thousands of years, yet it still cannot eliminate hatred, nor can it eliminate class struggle, national and racial conflicts, and even less can it eliminate the long-term and continuous cannibalistic wars? Why is it that in the Soviet Union, it was possible to eradicate the system of human exploitation of man, establish new social and moral relations, and change the moral outlook of millions of people, making the Soviet Union a great socialist country with political and moral consolidation and unity? The main reason is not that morality played a major role, but that the economic system and mode of production determined the development of society and morality. At the congress, there were many bourgeois sociologists who promoted that capitalism has disappeared in the world, and has become a new "collective" system that is either non-socialist or similar to socialism, a society with only the middle class, or a society of social managers. The American sociologist D. Bellah, in her report entitled "Class Organization in the Golden Age," said that modern international society is developing in the direction of a proletarian society, but this development is not through socialist revolution and the establishment of a worker-peasant regime, but through the development of the "middle class," which also includes the proletariat. She affirmed that, according to Stalin's so-called basic law of socialism, it has been fully realized in the United States. People's living welfare is improving day by day, and all economy is trending towards serving society. Bourgeois sociologists, especially American sociologists, have said for a long time that the term "class" has become obsolete and unsuitable, and should be replaced by the new term "stratum," so society should not be divided by class now, but by stratum, that is, the division of people should be based on social occupation. Therefore, in their reports, class struggle seems to have been eliminated, and workers seem to have the possibility of climbing to the upper class of society, receiving higher education, buying stocks, and sharing profits in enterprises and institutions, and so on. These bourgeois sociologists, especially American sociologists, believe that the phenomenon of capitalists exploiting workers has basically disappeared now; the opposition of classes seems to have disappeared as well; workers also own private property and have become part of the middle class; and capitalists are no longer the owners of enterprises, but have become enterprise service personnel. Therefore, the middle class seems to have become the majority in society, and the phenomenon of their income imbalance is gradually decreasing. European and American bourgeois sociologists, such as D. Bellah and Y. Freedman, both believe that the private property of individual capitalists has undergone fundamental changes. They say that the property of joint-stock companies has become social property, because this property is already under government supervision, and ownership is limited to society. In addition, among bourgeois sociologists, there are also so-called distribution theorists. This school of thought believes that the existence of classes is only because of the difference in their income, rather than taking the possession of means of production as their standard. There are also people who discuss classes from a biological point of view, that is, the so-called class biological theory. This school of thought believes that the division of society into various classes can only be judged by their biological characteristics or intellectual instincts. All of these are speaking from the bourgeois point of view; taking one example as a general illustration, I won't elaborate here.

In capitalist countries, there is simply an abundance of publications on so-called sociology, covering everything. In capitalist countries, sociological literature is everywhere, such as various social surveys. They use this to promote how much they value social life in their countries, and how much they value the education and welfare of workers. These bourgeois sociologists often use individual facts to try to prove how the working masses in capitalist countries can improve their lives and defend capitalism. The reactionary rightists want to restore bourgeois sociology for this purpose! In addition, the so-called research of bourgeois sociologists is mostly based on positivism and some trivial and unimportant things. For example, when discussing social changes in the 19th century at the Third International Congress of Sociologists, they meticulously studied such questions as: "Why do mothers dote on their eldest sons, while grandmothers dote on their youngest children?" "Do natives of Eastern countries wear trousers or not? Are Westerners willing if natives of Eastern countries go to see them not wearing trousers but wrapped in large Eastern felt?" and so on. The sociology of modern capitalist countries has become a descriptive subject day by day. Some bourgeois sociologists themselves admit that current sociology is in danger of becoming merely a description of things instead of theoretical analysis. Therefore, sociology is dissolved in statistics, or becomes a sociology of various aspects of social life. In this way, sociology can include the sociology of rural life, the sociology of industrial enterprises and cities, the sociology of family, and so on, but the general development process of society cannot be analyzed. In other words, the existence of social science is generally denied.

Marxists believe that only historical materialism can be regarded as true scientific sociology. Historical materialism can give a materialistic explanation to all social phenomena, and can study the interrelationships, changes, and development of these phenomena through scientific dialectical methods. When Lenin talked about Marx's historical materialism, he pointed out that such materialism is the only correct and scientific theory of sociology, and also the only correct method of social science. Marxism proves that all social phenomena are interconnected, which is the law and driving force of social development; the emergence, development, and replacement of all social systems are completely determined by objective laws, regardless of human will. Marx's sociology elucidates the origin of private property, family, class, state, and law, and points out that the role of class struggle is the driving force of social development, and the role of production methods is the decisive force in the transition from one social system to another. Marx's sociology uniquely and correctly answers the question of the relationship between social consciousness and social life, the question of who is the foundation and who is the superstructure between social material and spiritual life, and also reveals the role of government and law, the role of ideas, the role of subjective facts, the role of the masses and individuals in history, and so on, showing that only objective material conditions are the most fundamental foundation of all human activities.

After understanding what true Marxist sociology is, we can see the "reformed" sociology of reactionary rightists such as Fei Xiaotong and Wu Jingchao, as well as the so-called "proletarian sociology" proposed by Zhao Wenbi. Although they often wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, they are actually smuggling private goods in an attempt to restore bourgeois social science in China, which we cannot allow. Our social scientists in New China must unite under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and wage a merciless struggle against the restoration of bourgeois social science by the rightists.

    现代资产阶级社会学是些什么货色？
    朱务善
    曾昭抡、钱伟长等反党反社会主义的科学纲领，是章罗联盟右派资产阶级政纲中的组成部分。而费孝通、吴景超等人的资产阶级社会学复辟阴谋，又是反动科学纲领的一部分。他们相互勾结，表里为奸，实行其反共反社会主义的阴谋，以图资本主义复辟。尽管费孝通、吴景超这一流人说什么新社会学应以历史唯物主义为基础，恢复社会学就是要为社会主义建设作点工作等等，而其目的无非是复辟资产阶级社会学。
    照本来的定义说，社会学是研究人类社会一般发展规律的学问，马克思主义者并不反对这门学问。但是，资产阶级的社会学自孔德、斯宾塞开始，主要是以唯心主义为基础来研究社会的。在十七、十八世纪盛行最广的魏科的历史循环论、卢梭的社会契约论等几大派资产阶级社会学，都不能脱离剥削社会制度立论。换句话说，直至马克思、恩格斯的真正社会学产生以前，旧的唯心派的社会学者，没有正确了解社会一切现象是相互联系的，有一定发展规律的。到后来一般资产阶级的所谓社会学者，更是变本加厉，公开地为垄断资本辩护，用尽一切方法想挽救垂死的资本主义制度。就拿1956年在阿姆斯特丹所召开的社会学者第三次国际代表大会为例，绝大多数资产阶级社会学者，在讨论十九世纪社会变迁的时候，对于资本主义阶级矛盾、社会主义制度的产生、帝国主义殖民政策之日益破产以及民族解放运动之日益高涨等使二十世纪社会发生变迁的最基本问题，绝口不谈。他们所注意的，只限于一些次要的现象，如在资产阶级立法中发生了一些什么不关重要的改良，在劳动、教育、家庭、宗教、婚姻等方面发生了一些什么不关重要的变化。他们企图以这些现象说明二十世纪的社会变迁。就这次国际代表大会材料，再来检查一下资产阶级的社会学家的所作所为，从而可以看到费孝通、吴景超等所要恢复资产阶级社会学的真正动机。
    在这次代表大会上，资产阶级社会学家，各以其专门调查，大放厥词，真是五花八门，莫衷一是。概括地说，这些资产阶级的社会学者的哲学和社会学观点，主要是出于实证论，多元论。例如，M·根止别尔格在谈到社会变迁的事实的时候，就把一些能够使社会发生变迁的事实分为四类来研究。因此，他对于社会的变迁，只能以多元事实来说明。这是不能使问题得到根本的解决的，因为这不能说明哪一种事实是主要的，哪一种是次要的。亦即不能说明如下一个问题：社会物质条件是主要的，还是人的意识是主要的？M·达维和A·卢子就“法权与社会变迁”作了报告。A·卢子证明，法权是支持社会或社会统治力量一种最宝贵的东西，是实现社会变迁的主要工具。照他的意思，法官和行政管理员常常就是“社会变迁自觉或不自觉的创造者，因为他们凭着自己的权力，并不经过多数人民许可或立法机关批准就可以解释法律，创造法律。”我们也承认法权的积极作用，但是我们认为：法权不是首要的社会事实，而是如同政府机构和其它一切政治法律社会上层建筑一样，是建立于一定的经济基础之上的。所以在肯定法权有创造性作用的时候，必须先用科学方法说明法权本身的产生变迁及其发展。社会科学家ж·伏奈义列教授和P·安得热尔教授报告“道德问题与社会变迁”，他们都认为道德在社会上是单独存在的。安得热尔教授反对马克思的观点，不承认生产关系常常起决定性的作用，而道德之为用，不过是他的表现而已。 P·安得热尔否认人的生产和物质关系在社会法权道德和一切精神生活发展过程中所起的决定性作用，抹煞在阶级社会里道德有阶级性问题，宣传在阶级社会里道德有统一的意义，并且肯定道德在改变社会中能起决定性作用。请问：如果道德改变社会能起决定性作用，那么为什么基督教的道德在数千年间宣传了人人当亲其亲长其长，然而至今还不能消灭仇恨，也不能消灭阶级斗争、民族和种族冲突，更不能消灭长期不断的人食人的战争呢？为什么在苏联却能铲除了人剥削人的制度，建立了新的社会道德关系，改变了千百万人的道德面貌，使苏联建立成一个在政治上和道义上巩固一致的伟大的社会主义国家呢？其主要原因，并不是道德起了什么主要作用，而是经济制度和生产方式决定了社会和道德的发展。在大会上有不少的资产阶级社会学家，宣传现在资本主义在世界上已经绝迹了，已经变成了如果非社会主义、即是类似社会主义的新的“集体”制度了，变成了只有中产阶级的社会、或者是社会管理人的社会了。美国社会学家D·别尔拉尔德在她的以“在黄金时代的阶级组织”为题的报告中说，现代国际社会是朝着无产阶级社会方向发展的，可是这个发展不是经过社会主义革命和建立工农政权，而是经过“中产阶级”的发展，这些中产阶级也吸收了无产阶级在内。她肯定说，按照斯大林所谓社会主义基本规律，在美国已经全部实现。人民生活福利日益改善，一切经济都是趋向为社会服务的。资产阶级社会学者，特别是美国的社会学者，好久以前已经说过，阶级这一名词，已经陈旧不适用了，应当代之以新的“阶层”这一名词，所以现在不应以阶级划分社会，而应以阶层划分，即人的划分应以社会职业为本位。所以在他们的报告中，阶级斗争好像是取消了，工人好像有可能爬到社会上层阶级，受到高等教育，购买股票，以及在企业机关中分得利润，等等。这些资产阶级的特别是美国的社会学者，认为现在资本家剥削工人的现象在基本上已经没有了；阶级的对立好像也没有了；工人也拥有私有财产，而成为中产阶级之一部；资本家已经不是企业的主人，而变成企业服务人员。因此，中产阶级好像已成为社会中之多数，他们收入不平衡的现象也渐渐消减。欧洲和美国资产阶级社会学者，如D·别尔拉尔德和Y·伏力德曼都认为个人资本家的私有财产，已经有了根本的变化。他们说股份公司的财产，已经成了社会财产，因为这种财产已经在政府监督之下，所有权只限于社会了。此外，在资产阶级社会学者中，还有所谓分配论者，这一派人以为阶级的存在，只是因为他们收入多寡之不同，而不是以生产资料占有为其标准。还有人以生物学的观念来论阶级的，即所谓阶级生物学理论。这一派人以为社会分为各种阶级，只能以他们生物上的特性或者是智力上的本能来判断。所有这些都是以资产阶级观点说话的；举一概三，这里我也不用多述了。
    在资本主义国家里，关于所谓社会学的刊物，简直是汗牛充栋，无所不包。在资本主义国家里，社会学的文献到处皆是，如各种社会调查。他们就借此宣传在他们国家里如何重视社会生活，如何重视工人的教育问题和福利问题。这些资产阶级社会学者，常常利用个别事实，企图证明劳动群众在资本主义国家里如何可以改良生活，为资本主义进行辩护。反动的右派想要恢复资产阶级的社会学，目的就在于此！此外，资产阶级社会学者所谓研究，多半是根据实证主义一些细末无关重要的东西。比如在第三次国际社会学者代表大会上讨论十九世纪社会变迁的时候，他们不惮其烦地研究这样一些问题：“为甚么母亲酷爱长子，而奶奶则酷爱幼孩？”“东方国家土人穿裤不穿？西方人是否愿意如果东方人去见他们不穿裤子而围之以东方的大毡？”等等。现代资本主义国家的社会学，已经一天一天变成为一种记述的课目。有些资产阶级社会学者连自己也承认，现在的社会学有由理论分析而成为只是描写事物的危险。因此，社会学溶化在统计学之中，或者成为社会生活各方面的社会学。这样一来，社会学中可以有乡村生活的社会学、工业企业及城市的社会学、家庭的社会学等等，而对于社会总的发展过程，就不能加以分析，换句话说，一般否认社会科学之存在。
    马克思主义者认为，只有历史唯物主义才能算是真正的合乎科学的社会学。历史唯物主义能对一切社会现象，给以唯物的解释，并能对这些现象的互相关系及其变迁和发展，通过科学的辩证方法来研究。当列宁论到马克思的历史唯物主义时，他指出：这样的唯物主义是唯一正确的合乎科学的社会学理论，而且也是社会科学唯一的正确方法。马克思主义证明：一切社会现象是相互联系的，这就是社会发展的规律和推动力；一切社会制度的产生发展和更替，完全由客观的规律决定，而不管人的意志如何。马克思的社会学阐明了私有制、家庭、阶级、国家、法权的起源，并指出了阶级斗争的作用乃是社会发展的推动力，生产方法的作用乃是从这一社会制度转变到另一社会制度有决定性力量。马克思的社会学唯一正确地解答了社会意识同社会生活的相互关系问题、社会物质同精神生活谁是基础谁是上层建筑问题，而且揭发了政府和法权的作用、思想所起的作用、主观事实所起的作用、群众和个人在历史上的作用等等问题，表示出只有客观的物质条件才是人类一切活动最根本的基础。
    明白了什么叫做真正的马克思主义社会学之后，就可看出反动的右派分子如费孝通、吴景超改良的社会学，以及赵文璧所提议的什么“无产阶级社会学”。他们虽常常披着马列主义的外衣，而实际上却在偷运私货，以图资产阶级的社会科学在中国的复辟，这是我们不能容许的。我们新中国的社会科学家要一致团结在马列主义的旗帜之下，同右派的资产阶级社会科学复辟作无情的斗争。
