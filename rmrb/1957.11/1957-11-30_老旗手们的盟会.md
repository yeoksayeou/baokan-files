	League of Old Standard-Bearers
		By Hu Jibang, Our Staff Reporter
	The Hungarian Partisans Association held its national representative conference in the Parliament Building on November 23rd and 24th. This was a long-awaited alliance for the old warriors. More than 300 representatives selected from over 3,000 members nationwide and special guests from thirteen countries attended the meeting. To show their respect for the distinguished guests and representatives, the government specially opened the main entrance of the building. Entering the venue from the main entrance, one must first pass through the marble steps covered with red felt, the brightly lit halls and corridors. A solemn atmosphere led people into the venue. The most eye-catching things in the venue were the countless medals flashing on the chests of the representatives and the expressions of excitement on their faces. Everyone brought victory and their own glorious combat experience.
	Among the guests was Lieutenant General Fedorov, the famous hero who led the Ukrainian guerrilla movement, who represented the Soviet Veterans Association to address and present gifts to the conference. There was also General Lister, the Spanish hero who defended Madrid, a French guerrilla commander, and a representative of the anti-Nazi struggle in West Germany. Representatives from the anti-fascist organizations and veterans associations of the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Albania, Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria, and the president of the International Federation of Resistance Fighters and Victims of Fascism, etc. All of them spoke successively. The conference also read out congratulatory messages from various places. Everyone felt that the only regret was that the representative of the Chinese Long March veterans did not arrive in time.
	The epics of the Hungarian partisans are too numerous to mention. Sitting in front of me was a delicate white-haired woman, everyone called her Anna Mari. This name was the hope and comfort of the wounded soldiers during the Spanish Civil War. She was the Red Nightingale, and the comrades who participated in the International Brigades still miss the Hungarian Anna Mari. During the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots last year, she and her son took up arms again to defend the people's regime.
	Sitting opposite me was a spirited old warrior, whom people called Tang Gaiji, the representative of "a single heart in a thousand languages." Please look at the fighting path he has traveled in his life: In 1919, he was a Red Army soldier defending the Hungarian Soviet Republic. After the Soviet Republic was overthrown by reactionary forces, he was exiled abroad for a long time. He had been to Belgium, Austria, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union, and participated in the ranks of various fraternal parties, fighting for the elimination of the common enemy and the realization of a common ideal. He did not return to his motherland until after the liberation of Hungary. On October 24 last year, he was also the first soldier to take up arms to defend the motherland. When the new government re-established its armed forces, he was a soldier in the First Army Corps. Now he has returned to his original work post.
	The guerrilla fighter Liushachi in 1942 was a lawyer. On the morning of October 24 last year, he took his son to join the guerrillas and immediately participated in the defense of the Ministry of Interior. His son unfortunately died in the battle. He took out a photo of the father and son from his arms to show me, a handsome young man of twenty-one years old, the secretary of the League branch of the Lenin Institute. He said that although he had lost his dearest son, it had benefited the cause of the Party. A middle-aged soldier used to be a worker in the Csepel Metallurgical Combine. On the night of October 23 last year, he took his sixteen-year-old son to defend the District Party Committee. The father and son persisted in their combat posts for several weeks without returning home. After the incident, they also participated in the workers' self-defense forces. Over the past year, his son has been tested and tempered in various ways. Because of his firm stance, bravery, and simplicity, the Party has exceptionally approved his son's application to join the Party, and he is now a formal Party member.
	The Partisans Association was established in 1946. In the past, especially after 1949, due to the adverse consequences of the personality cult, this heroic contingent in the international workers' movement did not receive enough attention, and even some people were discriminated against. Last year, the revisionist right-wing group attempted to use the contradictions between them and the old leadership to divide their ranks, but it did not succeed. The vast majority of members stood firm and were not involved in the riots. On the second day of the incident, in the capital alone, one hundred people gathered at the association's headquarters. At this difficult moment, some came out of the hospital with illness, and some limped from their homes, asking to take up arms and join the battle. The association immediately organized combat teams and persisted until October 31 before going underground. After the establishment of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government on November 4, it actively assisted the Party organization in forming the first revolutionary officers' corps, and some were sent to serve in the western border defense posts. The guerrillas also played a leading role in the workers' self-defense forces. On the ideological front, they carried out an uncompromising struggle against revisionism and opportunism through the Tan Qiqi Club and "Hungarian Weekly."
	This meeting will greatly strengthen the organization and role of the association. The Partisans Association used to be a general mass organization affiliated to the Military Sports Association. Now it is directly under the Party Central Committee and directly leads the work of the Military Sports Association. The meeting adopted the organizational charter, elected the leading body, and will expand its ranks, first absorbing proletarian internationalist fighters who showed particularly heroic and loyal during the October incident. The public security forces who bravely defended the municipal Party committee last year are also objects of membership.
	The conference emphasized that the future task is to strengthen the unity of all tested and loyal fighters, strengthen internationalist and pro-Soviet friendly education among the masses, especially among young people, and establish close ties with the Communist Youth League. The prestige of the old warriors among the masses has greatly increased over the past year. Members often receive invitations from factories and youth organizations, asking them to tell about their combat experiences. During this Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Month celebrating the great October Revolution, old warriors and the Soviet army have become universally invited and most welcomed objects by the masses. This shows that revolutionary integrity has risen among the masses. The old warriors said that now that they have the support of the Party and the government, and the love of the masses for them, the conditions for carrying out work are already in place. In fact, today they have become a core force of the Party, shouldering their due responsibilities in strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses.

    老旗手们的盟会	本报记者　胡济邦
    匈牙利游击队员协会11月23和24两日在国会大厦举行全国代表会议，这是老战士们盼望已久的一个盟会，出席这个会议的有从全国三千多会员中选出的三百多个代表和十三个国家的特邀来宾。政府为表示对贵宾和代表们的尊敬，特别打开大厦的正门。从正门进入会场，必先经过那铺着红毡的大理石台阶、灯光辉煌的大厅和走廊。一种庄严肃穆的气氛把人们引进会场。会场里最引人注目的是代表们胸前闪烁着的无数勋章和他们脸上的兴奋的神情，每个人都带来了胜利，都带来了自己光辉的战斗经历。
    来宾中有领导过乌克兰游击队运动的著名英雄费多罗夫中将，他代表苏联的老战士协会向大会致词和献礼，还有保卫马德里的西班牙英雄李斯特将军，有法国的游击队司令，西德的反纳粹斗争的代表。德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、阿尔巴尼亚、南斯拉夫、波兰、保加利亚的反法西斯组织和老战士协会的代表们以及抵抗运动战士及受法西斯迫害与囚禁者国际联合会的主席等等。他们都先后讲了话。会议还宣读了各地发来的贺电。大家认为美中不足的是中国长征战士的代表未赶到。
    匈牙利游击队员们的史诗举不胜举。在我面前坐着一位清秀的白发妇人，大家都叫她安娜·玛利。这个名字在西班牙内战时期是受伤战士的希望和安慰，她是红色的奈丁格尔，参加过国际纵队的战友们至今还怀念着匈牙利的安娜·玛利。去年，匈牙利反革命暴乱期间，她又和自己的儿子一起拿起武器来保卫人民的政权。
    坐在我对面一位神采焕发的老战士，人们称他为“千种语言一条心”的代表者唐盖吉。请看他一生走过的战斗道路吧：1919年，他曾经是保卫匈牙利苏维埃共和国的红军战士。苏维埃共和国被反动势力颠覆后，他长期流亡国外，他到过比利时、奥地利、德国、意大利、法国、西班牙、美国、加拿大和苏联等国，参加过各兄弟党的队伍，为消灭共同的敌人实现一个共同的理想进行过斗争。匈牙利解放后，他才回到自己的祖国。去年10月24日，他也是第一个拿起武器保卫祖国的战士。在新政府重新建立武装队伍时，他是第一军团的战士。现在他才回到自己原来的工作岗位。
    1942年的游击队员柳沙奇，是一位律师，去年10月24日的早晨，他带着自己的儿子加入游击队，马上参加内务部的保卫战，儿子不幸在战斗中牺牲了。他从怀中取出父子合影的像片给我看，一个二十一岁的英俊青年，列宁学院的团支部书记。他说，他虽失去了最心爱的儿子，但对于党的事业却带来了好处。一位中年的战士过去是切佩尔冶金联合企业的工人。去年10月23日的夜间，他带了自己十六岁的儿子一起去保卫区党委，父子俩一直坚持战斗岗位几个星期没有回家。事件后，又一同参加了工人自卫队，一年来他的儿子受到了各种考验和锻炼。由于立场坚定、勇敢、质朴，党已破例批准了他儿子的入党申请，现在已成为正式党员了。
    游击队员协会在1946年就已成立，在过去时期，特别在1949年以后，由于个人崇拜所产生的不良后果，这支国际工人运动中的英雄队伍没有受到足够的重视，甚至若干人受过排挤。去年修正主义右派集团企图利用他们和旧领导之间的矛盾来分化他们的队伍，但未得逞，绝大多数会员都站稳立场，未被卷入暴乱。他们在事件发生第二天，仅在首都一地，就有一百人集合到协会总部。在这个困难时刻，有的带病从医院出来，有的拐着腿从家中赶来，纷纷要求拿起武器加入战斗。协会马上组织了作战的队伍，坚持到10月31日才转入地下活动。11月4日工农革命政府成立以后，积极协助党组织第一个革命军官团，有的被派去担任西部边防职务。游击队员在工人自卫队中，也起了带头作用。在思想战线上，通过谭启琦俱乐部和“匈牙利周刊”，同修正主义、机会主义进行了不妥协的斗争。
    这次会议将大大加强协会的组织和作用。游击队员协会过去是一般的群众性组织，附属于军事体育协会，现在直属党中央并直接领导军事体育协会的工作。会上通过组织章程，选出领导机构，并将扩大自己的队伍，首先吸收十月事件中表示特别英勇和忠诚的无产阶级国际主义战士，去年英勇保卫市党委的公安军也是被吸收入会的对象。
    大会强调今后的任务是加强团结所有受过考验的忠诚战士，在群众中加强国际主义和对苏友好的教育，特别是对青年的教育，并和共青团取得紧密联系。老战士们一年来在群众中的威信已大为增长，会员们常常收到工厂和青年组织的邀请，要求他们讲述自己的战斗生平。在这次庆祝伟大十月革命的匈苏友好月中，老战士和苏军成了群众普遍邀请和最受欢迎的对象。这说明革命正气已在群众中上升。老战士们说，现在既有党和政府的支持，又有群众对他们的爱戴，展开工作的条件已具备了。实际上，今天他们已成为党的一支核心队伍，担负起了他们在加强党和群众联系中所应有的职责。
