Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th -- The 1957 National Basketball Class A League, with the participation of the nation's twelve best men's Class A basketball teams and eleven women's Class A basketball teams, began in Guangzhou City on the afternoon of the 14th. They engaged in their first battles according to their respective groups.

The battles on the first day were unusually tense and fierce. The three strong men's teams, "seed teams" respectively ranked in the three groups: the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Yellow Team (Group 1), "August 1st" Red Team (Group 2), and Beijing Team (Group 3), all underwent very fierce struggles on the 14th, and finally defeated their first opponents by only a small margin.

The Shanghai White Team, which won second place in last year's National Basketball Class B League for men, played quite well in the match against the "August 1st" Yellow Team on the 14th. They had the advantage from the start of the game, leading thirty-four to twenty-nine at the end of the first half. The "August 1st" Yellow Team launched a fierce counterattack in the second half, and finally won by a narrow margin of sixty-three to sixty-two with only a one-point advantage.

The match between the Beijing Team and the Shanghai Red Team was also very tense. Although the Beijing Team led by ten points in the first half, the agile Shanghai Red Team repeatedly broke through the defense of the taller Beijing Team in the second half, gradually narrowing the score gap. In the last three minutes, they once narrowed the gap to seventy-six to seventy-four, only two points behind. The Beijing Team finally successfully used the tactics of controlling the ball and seizing opportunities to attack, and won by a narrow margin of seventy-nine to seventy-six.

The results of the other four men's team and five women's team matches on the 14th were:

Men's Group 1: Shenyang Team defeated the Beijing Military Team by fifty-one to forty-eight. Men's Group 2: "August 1st" Red Team defeated the Chengdu Team by eighty-two to fifty-nine; Shenyang Military Team defeated the Tianjin Team by eighty-nine to seventy-four.
