    Zhangye, Dunhuang, and Linze Counties Achieve Average Grain Yield of Over 400 Jin Per Mu
    Achieving Agricultural Development Program Targets Ten Years Ahead of Schedule
    Xinhua News Agency report: The three counties of Zhangye, Dunhuang, and Linze in Gansu Province's Zhangye Special District have already met the national agricultural development program's grain production standard of 400 jin per mu, ten years ahead of schedule. Zhangye County's 690,000 mu of grain crops achieved an average yield of 404 jin per mu, Dunhuang County's 114,000+ mu averaged 401 jin per mu, and Linze County's 261,000 mu averaged 400 jin per mu.
    Additionally, Dunhuang County's 77,000+ mu of cotton fields averaged 105.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu, also exceeding the highest target in the national agricultural development program ten years ahead of schedule.
    These counties also saw the emergence of many large-scale, high-yielding fields. In Zhangye County's Liangjiadun Township, over 11,000 mu of grain crops averaged 628 jin per mu, with 24 mu of wheat averaging over 1,000 jin per mu. In Dunhuang County, the grain yield of seventeen agricultural cooperatives and production teams averaged between 500 and 1,000 jin per mu. The Zaba Liang Agricultural Cooperative in this county saw its three mu of wheat average 1,081 jin per mu. Linze County had 6,749 mu of grain crops averaging 500 jin per mu. In 1950, the average yield per mu in Zhangye, Dunhuang, and Linze counties was 202.5 jin, 190 jin, and 165.5 jin, respectively.
    In recent years, especially after collectivization, the counties have comprehensively implemented a series of yield-increasing measures, including water conservancy projects, increased fertilizer application, improved cultivation techniques, promotion of improved varieties, and afforestation for sand control. This year, the irrigated area in these counties accounts for more than 90% of the total cultivated area, and the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of grain crops has more than doubled compared to 1950, with the fertilizer application area increasing from approximately 50% to 100%. Improved wheat varieties have been fully promoted, and seeds are treated with chemicals. In Dunhuang County, where wind and sand hazards were more serious, the hazards have been basically controlled through extensive tree planting and afforestation. In Linze County, where soil salinization was more severe, large areas of land have been improved into fertile farmland through the continuous construction of drainage projects and sand and alkali removal.
    These three counties are located in the Hexi Corridor and have great potential for developing agricultural production. Currently, the Zhangye Special District has formulated a new agricultural development plan in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Third Plenary Session. According to this plan, these three counties will increase their agricultural production levels at an even faster pace. By the end of the third Five-Year Plan, the average unit area yield of grain will reach more than 800 jin.

    张掖、敦煌、临泽三县粮食平均亩产四百多斤
    提前十年达到农业发展纲要指标
    新华社讯　甘肃省张掖专区的张掖、敦煌、临泽三个县，已经提前十年达到了全国农业发展纲要中规定的四百斤的粮食产量标准。其中张掖县的六十九万亩粮食作物平均每亩产量达到四百零四斤，敦煌县的十一万四千多亩平均每亩达到四百零一斤，临泽县的二十六万一千亩平均达到四百斤。
    此外，敦煌县的七万七千多亩棉田平均每亩产皮棉一百零五点五斤，也提前十年超过了全国农业发展纲要的最高指标。
    这些县还出现了许多大面积的高额丰产田。张掖县梁家墩乡的一万一千多亩粮食作物平均亩产六百二十八斤，并有二十四亩小麦平均亩产一千多斤。敦煌县有十七个农业社和生产队的粮食产量，平均亩产达到五百斤到一千斤。这个县杂坝梁农业社的三亩小麦平均亩产达到一千零八十一斤。临泽县有六千七百四十九亩粮食作物，平均亩产五百斤。张掖、敦煌、临泽三个县1950年的每亩平均产量分别为二百零二点五斤、一百九十斤、一百六十五点五斤。
    几年来特别在合作化以后，各县都全面地进行了兴修水利、增施肥料、改良耕作技术、推广良种和防沙造林等一系列的增产措施。到今年，这些县的水地面积已占到总耕地面积的90％以上，平均每亩粮食作物的施肥量，比1950年增加一倍以上，施肥面积也由50％左右达到100％。小麦已全部推广良种，实行药剂拌种。风沙危害比较严重的敦煌县，经过大量植树造林，已经基本上控制了风沙的危害。土地盐碱化比较严重的临泽县，经过不断兴修排水工程、压沙洗碱，大片土地已经改良成为肥沃的良田。
    这三个县都位于河西走廊，发展农业生产的潜力很大。目前，张掖专区已根据中共八届三中全会的精神，制订了新的农业发展规划。按照这个规划，这三个县将以更快的速度提高农业生产水平。到第三个五年计划完成时，粮食平均单位面积产量将分别达到八百斤以上。
