Rushing to Stage the Satirical Comedy "A Gallery of Ugly Characters"
The Central Academy of Drama's Experimental Theatre is working day and night to rush-produce the five-act satirical comedy "A Gallery of Ugly Characters." This is a realistic drama reflecting the anti-Rightist struggle and exposing the ugliness of the Rightists. Here are the leading figures of the Rightists, the arsonists who plot conspiracies, reactionary officers who harbor deep hatred for the socialist revolution, bourgeois professors who consider themselves scholars, reactionary jurists who cling to the "Six Codes," shameless men of letters who are jumping clowns, self-important "movie stars," and hoodlum-like adopted sons and daughters... The bourgeois group of ugly characters will be revealed on stage, allowing the audience to see through their corrupt and ugly essence amidst laughter.

The play is directed by Sun Weishi, with actors Yu Lan, Geng Zhen, Liu Yanjin, Shi Yifu, Zhuang Zejing, and others playing the main roles. It will meet the capital's audience at the end of November. (Wen Jin)

    赶排讽刺喜剧“百丑图”
    中央戏剧学院实验话剧院正在日夜赶排五幕讽刺喜剧“百丑图”。这是反映反右派斗争、暴露右派丑态的现实戏剧。这里有右派头面人物、阴谋的纵火头目，有对社会主义革命深怀仇恨的反动军官，有自命为学者的资产阶级教授，有死抱着“六法全书”的反动法学家，有跳梁小丑的无耻文人，有自命不凡的“电影明星”，有流氓阿飞式的干儿子、干女儿……。资产阶级群丑现形在舞台上，让观众在笑声中看透他们腐朽、丑恶的本质。
    这个戏由孙维世导演，由演员于兰、耿震、刘燕瑾、石一夫、庄则敬等担任主要角色。11月底，它就可同首都观众见面。　（闻津）
