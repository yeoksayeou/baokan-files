After Seeing the Silk String Opera "The Empty Seal Box" Zhang Zhen

The silk string opera "The Empty Seal Box" depicts He Wenxiu, an imperial inspector, a typical good official in folk tales. He is young, brave, energetic, and cares about the masses. As soon as he arrives in Hangzhou by imperial order, he goes on a "private visit," disguised as a fortune teller, to investigate the grievances of the people. After walking around, he finally arrives at the home of the water bandit Sun Long. Here he encounters Li Yueying, a young woman seized by the water bandit. Li Yueying recounts how her father was killed by Sun Long, and also that Chen Jian, the prefect of Hangzhou, is in league with Sun Long, so there is no way to file a complaint. He Wenxiu writes a complaint for her. Just as he is about to leave, Sun Long, drunk, returns and calls at the door. Li Yueying quickly leads He Wenxiu out the back door, but Sun Long comes to the back and smashes the door. In a moment of quick thinking, Li Yueying opens the door and blocks Sun Long's view with her body. He Wenxiu stumbles out and flees.

The opera develops the conflict between He Wenxiu and the water bandit Sun Long and Chen Jian from this point. It seems that although the standards for good and bad people differ in each era, in folk literary works, those who represent or partially represent the interests of the people are often praised as good people or good officials.

The opera depicts He Wenxiu, this positive character, very vividly and with a distinct personality. He is not a mature official; although he is upright and kind, he is also naive and ignorant, and often reveals a strong young master's temper. When crossing the river with Zhou Neng, he is almost found out by Sun Long's questioning. When Sun Long traps him in the house, he panics. Now that he has escaped, the master and servant want to find lodging, but all the inns have been ordered by Chen Jian not to accommodate them. Zhou Neng takes him to a brothel. He drinks alone in the evening, self-satisfied with his adventurous behavior, thinking that with this complaint, Sun Long and Chen Jian, "tomorrow will be the day of your nemesis!" He carelessly leaves the seal in the courtyard, and the madam picks it up and offers it to Prefect Chen Jian.

After losing the seal, He Wenxiu's mood plummets from elation to extreme frustration. Moreover, Chen Jian suddenly brings soldiers to pay respects, but postpones his audience until the next morning. Chen Jian orders the soldiers to surround the Inspectorate to "protect the Inspector." He Wenxiu thinks of abandoning his post and fleeing, then of killing himself by banging his head, and even cries in fear. At midnight, he still cannot think of any ideas, and even "kneels to the north to bid farewell to the Emperor, and then to his parents..." preparing to be killed by Sun Jian on the pretext of impersonating an imperial inspector. Fortunately, the old servant Zhou Neng comes up with a plan to set fire to the stable, asking Chen Jian to guard the empty seal box, and then demanding compensation for the seal when he returns from putting out the fire. He Wenxiu is immediately happy when he hears the plan. The next day, Chen Jian is indeed tricked, takes the empty seal box, and gives him a deadline to hand over the seal in the morning court. Before ascending to the court, He Wenxiu happily kowtows to Zhou Neng.

This character is portrayed comprehensively in the opera, with the good official who cares about the masses, the young and brave but inexperienced aspects, and the aristocratic son's arrogance, carelessness, love of boasting when successful, and tendency to be frustrated when unsuccessful. Although this person is an intellectual, his knowledge does not seem to be very extensive, and he is often at a loss when faced with problems. In contrast to this character is the old servant Zhou Neng. He is a figure with rich life experience and wisdom. Seeing Chen Jian bring soldiers to see him, he concludes that the seal has already fallen into Chen Jian's hands because they have just arrived and "have not yet informed the officials, how would Chen Jian know that the master has arrived at the Inspectorate?" Moreover, he brought soldiers, clearly preparing to seize people if there was no seal. Based on this deduction, he comes up with the magical idea of ​​using an empty seal box to get the seal back. The opera depicts Zhou Neng finding ways to help He Wenxiu out of trouble several times. This contrasting writing highlights the loyalty and wisdom of the old servant Zhou Neng, and also highlights He Wenxiu's situation of being well-intentioned but lacking the knowledge of struggle.

The opera not only highlights the characters, but the structure of the script is also compact and focused, with each scene having engaging dramatic conflicts. The development of the contradictions is sharp and reasonable. Is it not natural that He Wenxiu is blocked by Sun Long when he returns home after writing a complaint for Li Yueying in such a "thrilling scene"? After He Wenxiu loses the seal, Prefect Chen Jian brings soldiers to request an audience, ordering the soldiers to surround the Inspectorate before leaving, forcing He Wenxiu to have no way to go to heaven or earth, and finally forcing out Zhou Neng's brilliant plan. Such a scene is also very natural, in line with the emotions and logic of the opera. Therefore, the entire plot appears tense and dramatic. The entire opera is coherent, with almost no fragmented transitional scenes. The revision of this script is quite successful.

Silk string opera is popular in the central, southern, and western regions of Hebei Province and has a history of four hundred years. The long-term integration with farmers has given this genre a simple and straightforward style. The lyrics are not elegant and pretentious, but direct and refreshing to listen to. The vocabulary is very rich, overflowing with the atmosphere of rural life. Like Chen Jian's lyrics: "Don't be afraid that your official is big and my official is small, a big ox can't crush a small flea, an evil dragon can't suppress a local snake, a small weasel has stolen a big rooster!"

Such lyrics are truly excellent in the opera, fluent, lively, and full of emotion, especially good at expressing character. The troupe now uses the "rhythmic dialogue" of Peking Opera to perform the dialogue, but I think rhythmic dialogue is not as good as spoken language, which can better exert the advantages of this genre: the literary quality of the language.

This is the first time I have heard this genre, and I think the tunes are very beautiful. The actors all sing with their natural voices, but at the end they turn up an octave. Like the "Little Sister's Dream" tune, the music stops when singing, and every word is heard clearly by the audience. The music all comes in together at the end of each sentence, just in time for the actors to sing a falsetto soprano, mixed together, it is really melodious and pleasant. This genre also has its own traditions in performance movements. For example, when He Wenxiu and Li Yueying are inside the door and hear Sun Long calling at the door, they are startled. When Li Yueying pulls He Wenxiu out of the back door, they grab hands and turn outwards, spinning in small circles, which is very neat and expresses the characters' panicked emotions. A knowledgeable comrade next to me greatly appreciated it.

The acting skills of the actors in this opera are also worth mentioning. Wang Yongchun's He Wenxiu vividly portrays the character's personality. He puts on the airs of a young master in front of the old servant. When Zhou Neng is worried during the private visit, he sticks out his chest and says grandly: "Don't you underestimate me!" When he loses the seal, he is so anxious that his eyes widen, searching the ground with Zhou Neng's candlelight, and his anxious emotions are portrayed very realistically. Especially when returning to the Inspectorate for the morning court, the yamen servants are lined up on both sides, Zhou Neng holds the empty seal box, He Wenxiu's face is shiny, his eyes are empty and lifeless, and he walks up slowly. His inner emotions are immediately recognizable as soon as he enters the stage. In this scene, Wang Yongchun also uses the trembling of the gauze hat wings to symbolically express his frightened mood. His true and false voices are also used very well, and he sings very nicely. He Yongjia's Zhou Neng portrays the loyal old servant's concern for his master's fate in the struggle. Especially when he is trapped in the Inspectorate, he thinks about a plan all night and finally comes up with a plan. He says: "Master, don't worry...you push the empty seal box on him, you go to put out the fire, when you come back from putting out the fire, you say, Chen Jian is bold, how dare he steal my seal,... wait until the morning court to see the seal, if there is a seal, then fine, if there is no seal, I will order you to exterminate the entire family!" This passage is said with fervor, mixed with his great anger at the evildoers, leaving a deep impression. Although this character is just He Wenxiu's servant, he shows that he is not an observer of the event, but a major figure in the struggle. Li Tieshan's Sun Long, Jin Shuangquan's Chen Jian, and Xu Yingfang's madam all perform appropriately. The actresses Yuan Xueping (playing "Little Sister's Dream") and Shi Lianxiu (playing Li Yueying) perform simply and sincerely. But more attention should be paid to the maintenance of the voice and the technology of its use.

I have only seen these two operas, "The Empty Seal Box" and "Little Sister's Dream," so it is impossible to have any accurate opinions. The above is just a little feeling after watching them. I also have an incidental thought. I think that genres like silk string that have been circulating in the countryside for a long time are a true art of the working people—the peasants. Its literature is peasant literature, its language is peasant language, and its artistic style is also deeply permeated with the simple, clumsy, and straightforward style of the peasants, and a kind of peasant's unique pure and humorous quality. This artistic style is worth cherishing. Now is the high tide of urban intellectuals going to the countryside and mountains to learn from workers and peasants. In art, theatrical workers like us who are often isolated from workers and peasants should also learn from the art that comes from the countryside and mountains and represents the tastes of the working people. May we learn more from their strengths and they learn less from our weaknesses. This is a little inspiration given to me by certain simple and sincere performing arts characteristics of silk string opera.

### 丝弦戏“空印盒”观后

    丝弦戏“空印盒”观后	张真
    丝弦戏“空印盒”描写了一个巡按何文秀，这是一个民间传说中好官的典型。他年轻、勇敢，有朝气，并且关心群众。他刚刚奉旨来到杭州，便去“私访”，化装成一个算命先生，去调查民间的冤抑。走来走去，终于走到水贼孙龙的家里去了。在这里他碰上被水贼霸占的姑娘李月英。李月英诉说了父亲被孙龙所害的经过，并且杭州知府陈坚也是孙龙一伙，因此告状无门。何文秀替她写了状子。刚要走时，孙龙醉熏熏地回来叫门，李月英急忙带何文秀走后门，孙龙却又来到后面砸门。李月英情急智生，开门后用身体挡住孙龙的视线，何文秀跌跌撞撞地跑出门外，落荒而逃了。
    这个戏从这里展开了何文秀与水贼孙龙和陈坚的矛盾。看起来，虽然好人、坏人的标准每个时代都不同，但是在民间文学作品中，那代表或部分代表了人民的利益的，是常常被颂为好人或好官的。
    这个戏描写何文秀这个正面人物非常生动，性格鲜明。他并不是一个成熟的官员，他虽然正直、善良，可也幼稚、无知，而且常常流露浓厚的大少爷脾气。在与周能过河时遇到孙龙，几乎被孙龙盘问出马脚，在被孙龙堵在家里时他又吓得惊慌失措，现在逃出来，主仆二人要去投宿，偏偏所有客店都被陈坚下令不许留客，周能带了他到妓院去住，他晚上独自饮酒，对自己的冒险行为自鸣得意，觉得有这一张状子，孙龙和陈坚，“明朝就是尔等的对头到了！”竟大咧咧地把印丢在院中而去。印被鸨儿拾着献给知府陈坚了。
    丢了印，何文秀从得意的心情一下就落到极端沮丧中去了。又加上陈坚忽然带了兵来谒见，推辞他明早召见后，陈坚命兵丁把察院团团包围“保护巡按大人”。何文秀一会想弃官逃走，一会想碰头一死，甚至吓得啼哭起来。到了三更还想不出任何主意，竟然“向北拜辞别万岁，再拜别二老双亲……”准备明早被孙坚以冒充巡按的罪名杀掉。幸而老仆周能想出一个在马棚放火，叫陈坚看守空印盒，救火回来叫陈坚赔印的计策。何文秀听到有了计策立刻又乐了。第二天陈坚果然中了计，接过了空印盒，并限他早堂交出印来，何文秀在升堂之前，竟高兴地给周能叩了一个头。
    这个人物在戏里表现得很全面，既有关心群众的好官的一面，也有年轻、勇敢，缺乏经验的一面，还有那种贵族子弟的骄傲、大意、得意时爱夸口而失意时又易于沮丧的阶级性格的一面。这个人虽然是个知识分子，可是知识似乎并不怎样多，遇到事常常是一筹莫展。与这个人物相对照的，是老仆周能这个人物。这倒是一个具有丰富的人生经验，富于智慧的人物。看到陈坚带兵来见，他就断定印已到了陈坚之手，因为他们主仆二人刚到“尚未告知众官，陈坚那贼怎知大老爷已落察院”？而且他带了兵来，分明是准备没有印就拿人的意思，根据这个推断，他才想出了用空印盒赚印的神奇主意。这个戏描写何文秀几次遇见难关，都是周能替他设法解围的。这种对照的写法，突出了老仆周能的忠直、智慧，也突出了何文秀的虽然有心为善而缺乏斗争知识的情况。
    这个戏不但突出了人物，剧本的结构也紧凑、集中，每一场都有吸引人的戏剧冲突。矛盾的发展是尖锐的而又是入情入理的。何文秀给李月英写状子被孙龙回家堵住，这种“惊险场面”不是很自然的吗？何文秀丢了印，知府陈坚带了兵来求见，临走命兵丁围住察院，逼得何文秀上天无路，入地无门，最后逼出了周能的奇计，这种场面也是很自然，合于戏情、戏理的。因此全剧剧情显得很紧张，戏剧性强。全剧一气呵成，几乎没有什么零碎的过场戏。这个剧本的整理是相当成功的。
    丝弦戏流行在河北省中部、南部和西部地区，至今已有四百年的历史。长期与农民结合的结果，使这个剧种风格纯朴、直爽，词句不是文雅扭捏的，而是单刀直入，听着很痛快。语汇十分丰富，洋溢着农村的生活气息。像陈坚的词：“不怕你的官大我官小，牛大压不住小跳蚤，恶龙难压地头蛇，小黄鼬把大公鸡叼走了！”
    这样的词句在戏词里真是上乘的词句，流利、明快而富于感情，特别长于表现性格。这个剧团在道白上现在采用京剧的“韵白”来演，我以为韵白是不如口语，更能发挥这个剧种的优点：语言的文学性的。
    这个剧种我还是第一次听，我觉得调子很好听。演员都是用真嗓唱，但到尾声时翻高八度。像“小二姐做梦”那个曲牌，唱时音乐都停了，每个字给观众听得清清楚楚，每句到尾声时音乐一齐跟上，正好赶上演员唱出假嗓的女高音，混在一起，实在悠扬动听。这个剧种在表演动作上也是有自己传统的，像何文秀与李月英在门里听到孙龙叫门，吃了一惊，李月英拉何文秀走后门时，两人拉住手双双向外翻身，转小圆场，就很干净利索，而又充分表现了人物惊慌情绪，我旁边一位内行同志就十分赞赏。
    这个戏演员的演技也是值得提起的。王永春演的何文秀，轮廓鲜明地刻划出这人物的性格来。在老仆面前他摆着少爷架子，私访时周能不放心，他挺着胸大咧咧地说：“难道你小看老爷我不成！”等到印丢了，他急得瞪大了眼睛，随着周能的烛光满地寻找，焦急的情绪演得很真实。特别是回到察院上早堂的时候，衙役两边排好，周能捧着空印盒，何文秀满脸油光，瞪着空虚无神的眼睛，慢吞吞地走上来，内心的感情一上场就令人一望而知。在这一场，王永春还利用纱帽翅的抖颤象征地表现了他心惊胆战的心情。他的真假嗓也运用得很好，唱起来很好听。何永甲饰的周能，刻划了这个忠直老仆对他的主人在斗争中命运的关心。特别是在困在察院，想了一夜的计策，最后想出计来了。他说：“老爷，你莫要着急……你将空印盒推到他身上，你去救火，救火回来，你就说，陈坚大胆，竟敢盗我印玺，……等到天明早堂看印，有了印玺还则罢了，无有印玺叫你满门犯剿！”这一段说得慷慨激昂，夹杂着他对于恶人的极大愤怒，给人印象是很深的。这个人物虽然不过是何文秀的家院，但他表明了自己不是事件的旁观者，而是斗争中的主要人物。李铁山的孙龙，金双全的陈坚，徐英芳的鸨儿，都能演得恰如其分。女演员袁雪屏（演“小二姐作梦”）和石连秀（演李月英），演得朴素而真挚。但还要多注意嗓音的保养和运用的技术。
    我仅仅看了这么两个戏，“空印盒”和“小二姐做梦”，不可能有什么准确意见，以上写的只算是一点观后感吧。我还有一个附带的感想。我觉得像丝弦这样在农村流传很久的剧种，是一种真正劳动人民——农民的艺术。它的文学是农民文学，它的语言是农民的语言，它的艺术风格也深深浸透着农民的朴素、直拙、爽朗的格调，和一种农民特有的淳厚的幽默。这种艺术风格是值得珍贵的。现在正当城市知识分子下乡上山，向工人农民学习的高潮，在艺术上，像我们这样一些经常与工、农隔绝的戏剧工作者，也应该向从乡间、从山上来的，代表劳动人民的口味的艺术好好学习。愿我们多向他们的优点学习，而他们少向我们的缺点学习。这是丝弦戏某些质朴而真诚的表演艺术特质，给与我的一点启示。
