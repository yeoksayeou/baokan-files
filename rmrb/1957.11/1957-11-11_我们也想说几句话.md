    We Also Want to Say a Few Words

    Not long ago, we had the opportunity to intern in the Soviet Union for a period of time. As the people of the whole country warmly celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution, we also want to say a few words.

    As soon as we arrived in the Soviet Union, the factory directors and Party committee secretaries of the factories we visited quickly arranged living and internship plans for us and repeatedly sought our opinions. Because the arrangements were so good, we really couldn't offer any suggestions, but they thought we were just being shy. The comrades who interned in Pskov lived a little far from the factory, so the factory director immediately vacated his office (because there was a shortage of housing in the factory at that time) and asked our comrades to move in; whether it was practical operation in the workshop or theoretical lessons, the Soviet comrades gave us a lot of convenience and support. For example, if there were not enough machine tools in the workshop, they changed the one-shift system to a two-shift system, or the two-shift system to a three-shift system, in order to give us the opportunity to operate. During theoretical lessons, our comrades with lower Russian proficiency had many difficulties in both listening and speaking, but the Soviet comrades patiently taught us Russian, and used all kinds of methods such as drawing pictures and making gestures to patiently explain repeatedly, until we truly understood. In the factory, we often heard their leading comrades and workers say: "You are good students sent by Mao Zedong, how can we be worthy of our Chinese friends if we don't teach you well?", "We feel supremely honored and happy to be able to contribute to the great Chinese people."

    The factory also took meticulous care of our lives. Every day, three meals were provided, and before and after meals, they would ask for our opinions, asking us what we liked to eat. If any of us felt unwell, the factory leaders would immediately ask us to rest or receive treatment. During holidays and festivals, they had already arranged places for us to rest and play. In the factory and other public places, many Soviet comrades who did not know us seemed to be old friends at first sight, and very kindly talked to us, asking about our study and life in the Soviet Union, and asking how the lives of Chinese workers and peasants were. When we gave them satisfactory answers, they would tightly hold our hands, and even embrace us and say: "Capable! The hardworking and brave Chinese people are capable!"

    The cultural and entertainment life of the Soviet people is very rich, and we were often invited to watch various dramas, films and songs and dances. The Soviet comrades were very hospitable, and we were also often invited as guests, and they treated us with very rich lunches or dinners. In the Soviet Union, we also personally saw many factories not only manufacturing complete sets of modern equipment and devices for our country, but also training complete sets of technical personnel for our country. Their high degree of internationalism deeply inspired and educated us.

    Now, we are using the science and technology and advanced experience taught to us by the Soviet comrades to build our motherland. We assure the great Soviet people that we must work hard to accelerate the socialist industrialization of our country, in order to repay the great Soviet people for their help and concern for us.

    我们也想说几句话
    不久以前，我们有机会在苏联实习了一个时期。当全国人民热烈庆祝伟大的十月革命四十周年之际，我们也想说几句话。
    当我们一到了苏联之后，所到工厂的厂长和党委书记，很快地为我们安排生活和实习的计划，并再三征求我们的意见。因为安排得太好了，我们实在提不出什么，他们却以为我们不好意思。在普斯科夫实习的同志们，住的地方距工厂稍远一点，厂长马上把他的办公室空出来（因为当时工厂里房屋很缺）、要我们的同志们搬进去住；不论是车间实际操作或是理论课，苏联同志们都给了我们很多方便和支持，如车间机床不够使用，他们为了使我们有操作机会，就把一班制改为两班制，或将两班制改为三班制。上理论课时，我们俄文水平较低的同志，不论是听和说都有很多困难，苏联同志则一面耐心教我们俄文，一面用尽办法如画图、作手势等，反复不厌地耐心讲解，直到我们真正听懂了为止。我们在工厂里经常听到他们的领导同志和工人们这样说：“你们是毛泽东派来的好学生，我们如不把你们教好，我们怎能对得起中国的朋友呢？”、“我们能为伟大的中国人民贡献一份力量，感到无上光荣和幸福”。
    厂里对我们的生活照顾也是无微不至。每天三顿饭，饭前、饭后都要征求我们的意见，问我们喜欢吃什么，如果我们有人身体不舒适，工厂领导上马上要我们休息或治疗。假期和节日，他们早就为我们安排好休息和游玩的地方。在工厂里和其他公共场所，很多与我们不相识的苏联同志，好像一见如故，非常亲切地找我们谈心，关心地问我们在苏联学习和生活的情况，问我们中国工人和农民生活得如何？当我们给了他们满意的答复时，他们就紧紧握着我们的双手，甚至和我们拥抱起来说：“能干！勤劳勇敢的中国人民，能干！”
    苏联人民的文化娱乐生活非常丰富，我们经常被邀请观看各种戏剧、影片和歌舞。苏联同志们很好客，我们也经常被邀请作客，他们用非常丰富的午餐或晚餐招待我们。我们在苏联还亲眼看到很多工厂不但为我国制造成套的现代化的设备和装置；还为我国培养成套的技术人员。他们的高度的国际主义精神，深深启发和教育了我们。
    现在，我们正在用苏联同志们教给我们的科学技术和先进经验建设我们的祖国。我们向伟大的苏联人民保证，我们一定要努力工作，加速我国的社会主义工业化，以答谢伟大的苏联人民对我们的帮助和关怀。
