Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 2nd, TASS dispatch: News bulletin from the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: The Central Committe of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a plenary session at the end of October this year. The plenary session discussed the issue of improving Party and political work in the Soviet Army and Navy. The plenary session passed a corresponding resolution, which was published today (November 2nd). The plenary session removed Comrade Zhukov from his positions as member of the Presidium and member of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

Resolution on Improving Party and Political Work in the Soviet Army and Navy

The Soviet armed forces achieved a victory of world historical significance in the Great Patriotic War. They are capable of fulfilling their tasks and have gloriously lived up to the love and trust of the Soviet people.

In the post-war years, thanks to the care of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and on the basis of the general upsurge of our national economy and the major achievements in the development of heavy industry, science and technology, the Soviet armed forces have reached a new and higher level in their development. They are equipped with all kinds of modern combat technical equipment and armaments, including atomic weapons, thermonuclear weapons and rocket technical equipment. The political and moral condition of the army is also at a high level. The command and political cadres in the army and navy are infinitely loyal to their people, the Soviet motherland, and the Communist Party.

The complex international environment, the arms expansion in major capitalist countries, and the safeguarding of our motherland's interests all require commanders, political organs, and Party organizations to continue to improve the combat readiness of the army, strengthen military discipline in the troops, educate the troops in the spirit of loyalty to the motherland and the Communist Party, and care for the spiritual and material needs of the soldiers.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that further improving Party and political work in the Soviet Army and Navy is of particular importance for solving these tasks. The mission of this work is to strengthen the combat effectiveness of our armed forces, unite all soldiers around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and educate soldiers in the spirit of infinite loyalty to the Soviet motherland, the friendship of all Soviet nationalities, and proletarian internationalism. However, there are still serious shortcomings in the practice of Party political work, and sometimes there is a simple underestimation of Party and political work.

The task put forward by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union before the Party and the people is to bring our national defense to the level of modern military technology and science and to ensure the security of our socialist country. In solving this task, in addition to the one-man command system, the military committees, political organs, and Party organizations in the army and navy also play an important role. They should all resolutely and consistently implement the policies of the Communist Party.

The main source of the power of our army and navy lies in the fact that their organizers, leaders, and teachers are the leading and guiding force of Soviet society – the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

It should always be remembered Lenin's instruction: "The policy of the military organs, like the policies of all other organs and institutions, should be implemented on the accurate basis of the general instructions issued by the Party through its Central Committee and under the direct supervision of the Party Central Committee."

The CPSU Central Committee Plenum pointed out that recently, former Defense Minister Comrade Zhukov violated the Leninist principles of the Party leading the armed forces. The line he implemented was to shrink the work of Party organizations, political organs, and military committees, and to abolish the leadership and supervision of the Party, the Party Central Committee, and the government over the army and navy.

The Central Plenum found that, with the personal participation of Comrade Zhukov, the cult of personality towards him began to be cultivated in the Soviet army. Under the flattery of some sycophants, he began to be praised in speeches and reports, in articles, films and pamphlets, exaggerating his personal role and his role in the Great Patriotic War. In this way, in order to please Comrade Zhukov, the true history of the war was distorted, the truth of the facts was distorted. The great efforts of the Soviet people, the heroism of our entire armed forces, the role of commanders and political workers, the military art of front and navy commanders, and the leading and inspiring role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, were all degraded.

The Party and the government attached great importance to the merits of Comrade Zhukov, awarded him the title of Marshal of the Soviet Union, awarded him the title of Hero of the Soviet Union four times, and awarded him many medals. He also gained great political trust: at the 20th Congress of the Party, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU. The Central Committee of the CPSU elected him as an alternate member of the Presidium of the Central Committee, and then as a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU. However, Comrade Zhukov, due to insufficient Party spirit, incorrectly understood the Party and the government's high evaluation of his merits, lost the humility of a Party member that Lenin taught us, presumptuously believing that he was the only hero of all the victories achieved by our people and our armed forces under the leadership of the Communist Party, and brutally violated the Leninist principles of the Party leading the armed forces.

Therefore, Comrade Zhukov failed to live up to the trust the Party placed in him. He became a politically unstable person, tending toward adventurism both in understanding the most important tasks of Soviet foreign policy and in leading the Ministry of Defense.

For the above reasons, the CPSU Central Committee Plenum decided: to remove Comrade Zhukov from his positions as member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and member of the CPSU Central Committee, and entrust the Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee to assign Comrade Zhukov to other work.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU believes that, in implementing the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Party organizations will continue to strive to further strengthen the national defense forces of our socialist country.

(All members of the Central Committee, alternate members of the Central Committee, and members of the Central Inspection Commission unanimously approved, and all military personnel and Party and Soviet responsible personnel attending the Central Plenum unanimously supported.)

    苏共中央委员会全会通过决议
    改进苏联陆海军中党和政治工作
    解除朱可夫的主席团委员和中央委员的职务
    新华社2日讯　塔斯社莫斯科2日电：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议新闻公报：苏联共产党中央委员会在今年10月底举行了全体会议。全会讨论了关于改进苏联陆海军中党和政治工作的问题。全会通过了一项相应的决议，这个决议在今天（2日）发表。全会撤除了朱可夫同志的苏共中央委员会主席团委员和苏共中央委员会委员的职务。
    关于改进苏联陆海军中党和政治工作的决议
    苏联武装力量在伟大的卫国战争中取得了具有世界历史意义的胜利，它是胜任自己的任务的，并且光荣地无负于苏联人民的爱戴和信任。
    在战后年代里，由于共产党和苏联政府的关怀，在我国国民经济普遍高涨，重工业、科学和技术发展取得重大成就的基础上，苏联的武装力量在它的发展中达到了新的更高的水平。它装备着各种各样的现代化战斗技术设备和武装，其中包括原子武器、热核武器和火箭技术设备。军队的政治和道德状况也处于很高的水平。陆海军中的指挥干部和政治干部无限忠诚于自己的人民、苏维埃祖国和共产党。
    复杂的国际环境、主要资本主义国家中的军备扩张、保卫我们祖国的利益，都要求指挥员、政治机构和党组织今后仍然不断地提高军队的战斗准备，加强部队中的军纪，用忠于祖国和共产党的精神教育部队，关心军人的精神和物质要求的满足。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议认为，进一步改善在苏联陆海军中党和政治工作对解决这些任务具有特别重要的意义，这项工作的使命是：加强我们武装力量的战斗力，把全体军人团结在共产党和苏联政府的周围，以无限忠于苏维埃祖国的精神、以苏联各民族友好和无产阶级国际主义精神来教育军人。然而，在党的政治工作的实践中还有着严重的缺点，而且有时表现出对党和政治工作简直估计不足。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在党和人民面前提出的任务是：使我们的国防达到现代化军事技术和科学的水平，保障我们社会主义国家的安全。在解决这一任务方面，除一长制的指挥官外，陆海军中的军事委员会、政治机构和党组织也起着重要的作用。他们都应当坚决地、一贯地贯彻共产党的政策。
    我们陆海军的威力的主要泉源在于：它们的组织者、领导者和教导者是苏维埃社会的领导力量和指导力量——苏联共产党。
    永远应当记住列宁的这一指示：“军事机关的政策，像所有其他机关和机构的政策一样，应当在党通过它的中央委员会所颁发的总的指示的准确基础上并在党中央的直接监督下实行。”
    苏共中央全体会议指出，近来，前国防部长朱可夫同志破坏了列宁关于领导武装部队的党的原则，他所执行的路线是收缩党组织、政治机构和军事委员会的工作，取消党、党中央和政府对陆海军的领导和监督。
    中央全会查明，在朱可夫同志的亲自参加下，在苏联军队中开始培植对他个人的崇拜。在一些阿谀奉承的人的逢迎下，在演讲和报告中，在文章、影片和小册子中，开始颂扬他，过分地夸大他个人和他在伟大的卫国战争中的作用。这样，为了讨好朱可夫同志，战争的真实历史被歪曲，事实的真象被曲解，苏联人民的巨大努力、我国全体武装部队的英雄主义、指挥员和政治工作者的作用、前线和陆海军指挥员的军事艺术、苏联共产党的领导作用和鼓舞作用，被贬低了。
    党和政府非常重视朱可夫同志的功绩，授予他苏联元帅的称号，四次授予他苏联英雄的称号，奖赏给他许多勋章。他在政治上也得到很大的信任：在党的第二十次代表大会上他当选为苏共中央委员。苏共中央委员会选他为中央委员会主席团候补委员，随后又成为苏共中央主席团的委员。但是朱可夫同志由于党性不够，不正确地理解党和政府对他的功绩的高度评价，丧失了列宁所教导我们的党员的谦虚，妄自以为他是我国人民和我国武装部队在共产党领导下所取得的一切胜利的唯一的英雄，粗暴地破坏了列宁关于领导武装部队的党的原则。
    因此，朱可夫同志辜负了党对他的信任。他成了在政治上站不稳的人，无论在理解苏联外交政策的最重要的任务方面以及在国防部的领导方面都倾向于冒险主义。
    由于上述原因，苏共中央全会决定：撤销朱可夫同志苏共中央主席团委员的职务和苏共中央委员的职务，委托苏共中央书记处给予朱可夫同志其他工作。
    苏共中央委员会全体会议相信，党组织在执行苏共第二十次代表大会的决议的时候，今后仍将为进一步加强我们社会主义国家的国防力量而努力。
      （中央委员会委员、中央委员会候补委员、中央检查委员会委员全体一致通过，出席中央全会的军人以及党和苏维埃负责工作人员全体拥护。）
