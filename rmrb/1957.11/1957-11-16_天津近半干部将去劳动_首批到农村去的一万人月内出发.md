Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin. Nearly 50,000 cadres in Tianjin will be sent to the countryside or factories to participate in labor, a figure that accounts for nearly half of the total number of cadres in the city; the first group of 10,000 going to the countryside will depart within the month. This was announced by Li Gengtao, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Mayor of Tianjin, at the "Broadcast Mobilization Meeting for Streamlining Institutions and Sending Cadres Downward" held on the 12th. This measure has been warmly supported by the broad masses of cadres, and tens of thousands of cadres eagerly signed up to respond to the call on the same day.

Now, a surge of enthusiasm for participating in agricultural production has been launched among cadres throughout the city. Cadres in many units have posted big-character posters and letters of determination, applying to go to the countryside to participate in labor. 80% to 100% of the cadres from the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Municipal People's Committee, the Municipal Higher and Intermediate People's Courts, and some enterprise departments have already signed up. Many cadres have written five or six letters of determination in a row, requesting the leadership to approve their participation in agricultural production and transform themselves through labor.

    天津近半干部将去劳动
    首批到农村去的一万人月内出发
    新华社天津讯　天津市将有五万名干部下放到农村或工厂参加劳动，这个数字占全市干部总数的将近一半；第一批到农村去的一万人将在月内出发。这是中共天津市委员会书记、天津市副市长李耕涛在12日举行的“紧缩机构下放干部广播动员大会”上宣布的。这一措施得到广大干部的热烈拥护，当天就有好几万名干部争先恐后地报名响应号召。
    现在全市干部已掀起参加农业生产的热潮。许多单位的干部纷纷张贴出大字报、决心书，申请到农村里去参加劳动。中共天津市委员会、市人民委员会、市高级和中级人民法院以及一些企业部门已经有80％到百分之百的干部报名，不少干部连续写了五六次决心书，要求领导上批准自己去参加农业生产，在劳动中改造自己。
