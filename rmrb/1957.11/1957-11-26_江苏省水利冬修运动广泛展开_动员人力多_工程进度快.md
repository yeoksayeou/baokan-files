(Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing) According to the Xinhua Daily, Jiangsu Province has launched a winter water conservancy construction campaign focusing on the construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. As of November 19th, over forty counties and cities throughout the province had commenced work on small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, along with more than thirty large and medium-sized projects. Hundreds of thousands of people are continuously heading to the water conservancy front lines. In Yangzhou and Xuzhou prefectures alone, over 700,000 laborers have been投入 into the campaign.

This winter and spring, Jiangsu Province's water conservancy construction will continue to prioritize changing the impoverished conditions in the Xuhuai region. Other areas will have different water conservancy construction priorities based on their local conditions. The central tasks are to vigorously drain waterlogged areas, actively develop irrigation, expand the area of dry land converted to paddy fields and irrigated land, and continue to improve and consolidate flood control capabilities.

According to the state-approved plan, Jiangsu Province will construct 157 large and medium-sized projects this winter and spring, including 34 for flood control, 76 for drainage, 45 for irrigation, and 2 for other purposes. The entire project includes 182 culverts, 157 bridges, and 70 pumping stations. Many of these are crucial projects for the development of agricultural production in the Xuhuai region. Small-scale farmland water conservancy projects will be distributed throughout the province. After the completion of the above projects, in terms of the benefits of large and medium-sized projects, they can improve drainage over 11.45 million mu, improve and expand irrigation over 2.95 million mu, and reduce the threat of floods to varying degrees.

In terms of small-scale farmland water conservancy, irrigation area can be increased by 4.19 million mu, irrigation area improved by 7.29 million mu, drainage area improved by 18.6 million mu, and water and soil conservation over 410 square kilometers.

The total amount of earthwork for water conservancy projects throughout the province is approximately 500 million cubic meters, mobilizing nearly 4.26 million laborers. Currently, the progress of water conservancy projects is rapid. On the Luma Lake dam, the foundation for the control gate to be built has been stripped of ten meters of soil from the ground, and 12,000 laborers will soon be pouring concrete on the solid foundation. In Jurong County, over 200 societies out of 400 have started work on over 200 projects, with 12,000 people working every day. In Cangji Township, Siyang County, one society has basically completed its winter repair plan.

    江苏省水利冬修运动广泛展开
    动员人力多　工程进度快
    本报南京电　据新华日报报道：江苏省以兴修小型农田水利工程为主的冬季水利建设运动已经开展了。到本月19日止，全省约有四十多个县市的小型农田水利工程和三十项以上大中型工程先后开工。成千上万的人陆续开往沿水前线。仅扬州、徐州两专区就有七十余万民工投入运动。
    江苏省今冬明春水利建设仍以改变徐淮地区贫困面貌为重点。其他地方根据本地情况各有不同的水利建设重点。中心任务是大力排涝，积极发展灌溉，扩大旱田改水田面积和水浇地，继续提高与巩固防洪能力。
    按照国家已批准的计划，江苏省今冬明春将兴修大、中型工程一百五十七项，其中属于防洪的三十四项，排涝的七十六项，灌溉的四十五项，其他二项，全部工程包括涵闸一百八十二座、桥一百五十七座、抽水机站七十个。其中有很多都是有关发展徐淮地区农业生产的关键性工程。小型农田水利工程则分布在全省各地。以上各项工程完工后，在大、中型工程效益方面，可以改善排水面积一千一百四十五万亩，改善和扩大灌溉面积二百九十五万亩，并在不同程度上减轻洪水的威胁。
    在小型农田水利方面，可以增加灌溉面积四百一十九万亩，改善灌溉面积七百二十九万亩，排水面积一千八百六十万亩，水土保持四百一十平方公里。
    全省各地总计应做水利工程土方约五亿公方，动员劳力近四百二十六万人。目前，水利工程的进度很快。在骆马湖大堤上，准备兴修节制闸的闸基已从平地剥去了十公尺厚的泥土，一万二千民工们即将在牢固的地基上浇灌混凝土。句容县四百个社中，有二百多个社的二百多处工程开工，每天上工的人数有一万二千人。泗阳县仓集乡有一个社已基本上完成了冬修计划任务。
