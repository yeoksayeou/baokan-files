Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are vigorously conserving coal consumption to support industrial construction.

    In order to save coal for cooking, many units have adopted natural draft stoves. Units that have modified their stoves have achieved the best results with each person using only four to five liang of coal per day, while the average use is only twelve liang, reducing consumption by about half compared to the supply standard. A certain unit modified its stove and mastered firing techniques, reducing the amount of coal burned per person per day to four liang and two qian, saving 60,000 jin of coal in half a year. A certain unit originally used 30 jin of coal to boil one pot (120 kilograms) of water, but after converting to a natural draft stove, it only took 12 jin of coal to boil the same pot of water. Currently, many units are adopting methods such as short-term rotational training, mutual observation, and apprenticeship to conduct stove modification and firing technique training, and promote this advanced experience in saving coal.

    Many units have adopted a variety of methods to save coal, truly starting with the small things, saving everywhere, and everyone saving. The Military Academy adopted methods such as appropriately reducing stoves, sifting out coal slag and mixing it with three-quarters of raw coal for burning, mastering the operating methods of "watch more, add less, add frequently, and spread evenly" when burning coal, coordinating cooking and stir-frying to shorten firing time, and assigning dedicated personnel to burn coal and supply it in fixed quantities. In half a year, it saved more than 430,000 jin of coal. Li Yinyi and Kang Shicai, cooks from a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison, sifted out more than 40,000 jin of coal bit by bit from coal slag. In addition, many units are also taking measures to combine offices and dormitories and reduce the number of stoves to save coal for heating.

### 处处节约　人人节约  解放军努力节约消费用煤

    解放军努力节约消费用煤
    新华社2日讯　中国人民解放军许多部队大力节约消费用煤，支援工业建设。
    为了节约炊事用煤，许多部队采用了自来风灶。修改了炉灶的单位，成绩最好的每人每日只用四、五两煤，一般的也只用到十二两，比供给标准降低一半左右。某部修改了炉灶，又掌握了烧火技术以后，每人每日烧煤量降低到四两二钱，半年内节约了六万斤烧煤。某部原来烧一锅（一百二十公斤）开水要用三十斤煤，改成自来风灶后，烧同样一锅开水只用十二斤煤。目前，许多部队正采取短期轮训、互相观摩和带徒弟等方法，进行改灶和烧火技术的训练，推广这一节约用煤的先进经验。
    许多部队在节约用煤方面采用了多种多样的办法，真正做到了从小处着手，处处节约，人人节约。军事学院采用适当减少锅灶，筛出煤渣掺四分之三的原煤再烧，烧煤时掌握“多看、少加、勤添、撒匀”的操作方法，作饭炒菜配合好，缩短烧火时间以及专人烧火、定量供应等办法，半年内就节约了四十三万多斤用煤。北京驻军某部炊事员李银义、康世才，就一点一滴地从煤渣中筛出了四万多斤煤。此外，还有许多部队正在采取合并办公室和宿舍，减少火炉的办法，节约烤火用煤。
