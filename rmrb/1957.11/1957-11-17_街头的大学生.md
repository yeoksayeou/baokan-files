    College Students on the Street
    One Sunday morning, a group of young people appeared on the streets of Changchun, humming tunes while sweeping the dirt and fallen leaves off the road. I went closer and saw that they were wearing the Northeast Normal University's school badge; they were indeed students from our school. There were many customers in the department store that day, especially a crowd gathered around the porcelain section. We went over to take a look and saw several more students from the Normal University working as shop assistants. One student in a light blue student uniform was answering a customer's question. One old man said to another old man: "Normal University students are helping to sell things today. It's really the first time I've seen it."

    街头的大学生
    星期天早晨，长春街头出现一群青年，哼着小曲，在扫除马路上的泥土和落叶。我走近一看，他们配带着东北师范大学的校徽，正是我们学校的同学。这天百货商店的顾客很多，尤其是瓷器组围了一堆人，我们走过去一看，又是几位师大的同学在当服务员。一位身穿浅蓝色学生服的同学正回答顾客的问话，一位老大爷对另一位老大爷说：“师大学生，今天帮着卖东西来了，真第一回看到。”
