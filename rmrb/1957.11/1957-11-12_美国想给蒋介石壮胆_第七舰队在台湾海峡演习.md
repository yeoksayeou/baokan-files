Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The US Seventh Fleet today conducted large-scale military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. Aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines of the US Seventh Fleet participated in the exercise.

Chiang Kai-shek and his military and political leaders watched the exercise on the Seventh Fleet's aircraft carrier "Goodman Richard." Hundreds of aircraft belonging to the fleet, including the latest attack bombers, performed bombing demonstrations for Chiang Kai-shek. American news agencies blatantly reported that the purpose of the US Seventh Fleet's exercise was to embolden Chiang Kai-shek and ensure that the United States "could almost immediately take action" to protect the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
