    The frost and snow of Qaidam have dyed the hair on his temples white, the wind and sand of Qaidam have carved wrinkles on his face, he works day and night beside the oil-gushing exploration wells, his energy is even greater than that of young lads! You can't see any signs of aging on him, his heart is like a fountain of youth! If you are amazed by his burst of energy like a waterfall, he will tell you with a smile: "In your beautiful Chinese myths, there is a miraculous elixir that can make people return to youth, and now I am convinced that there is such a miraculous elixir—the oil of Qaidam has this effect on me!"

    日晖柴达木的霜雪染白了头上的鬓发，柴达木的风沙雕刻出脸上的皱纹，他日夜在喷油的探井旁忙碌，劲头简直比年轻的小伙子还足！你在他身上看不见衰老的影子，他的心胸就像一口青春的喷泉！如果你惊奇他那瀑布般迸发的精力，他会笑嗬嗬的告诉你：“在你们中国美妙的神话里，有一种神丹妙药能使人返老还童，现在我确信有这种神丹妙药——柴达木的石油对我就起了这个作用！”
