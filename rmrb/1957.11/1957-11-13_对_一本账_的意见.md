    Opinions on "One Account Book"
    After reading Yang Damou's poem "One Account Book" in the "Poems from the Countryside" on the eighth page on October 17th, I was shocked. I always wanted to find some supplementary words up and down in this poem, but there were none.
    Perhaps the author's intention was to show that the landlord class in the countryside is still stubbornly resisting and the class struggle is still sharp, but unfortunately this intention is really difficult to see. Why did the author make such a purely objectivist description of a class enemy's hatred for us?

    对“一本账”的意见
    10月17日八版上“来自农村的诗”中杨大矛的“一本账”一首，读后使我一惊，我总想在这首诗的上上下下再找点什么补充的语句出来，可是没有。
    也许作者的意图是想说明农村中地主阶级还在顽抗，阶级斗争仍是尖锐的，可惜这种意图，实在难以看出。为什么作者把一个阶级敌人对我们咬牙切齿的仇恨，作这样纯客观主义的描写呢？
