At the broadcast evening party, Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, thanked the Soviet experts on behalf of the 800,000 workers in Beijing for their help in the construction of the capital. Workers from the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory stated at the celebration meeting that they would continue to carry forward the working class's tradition of hard work and strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to build the motherland faster and better.

    While holding various celebrations, all employees in Beijing also launched a socialist competition, striving to dedicate greater production achievements to the great 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant decided to increase pig iron production by 16,000 tons this year. The Anjiatan Coal Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau has overfulfilled the state's October raw coal production plan by more than 2,500 tons.

We must resolutely follow the path of socialism." He announced at the meeting that all members would launch a major winter production competition as a gift to the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    The capital's literary and art workers are busily rehearsing wonderful programs such as dances, music, and Peking opera, preparing to perform for three days at four grand garden parties in the capital starting from the 5th.

    A festive atmosphere has enveloped the entire city of Beijing. An eight-foot-long banner slogan "Workers of all countries, unite!" has been installed on the famous Qianmen Arrow Tower. On the four tall slogan towers newly erected on the east and west sides of Tiananmen Square and on East and West Chang'an Avenue are written the words in the hearts of millions: "Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!" "Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism!" "Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "Workers of all countries, unite!" "Celebrate the great victory of Soviet socialist construction!" "Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!" "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation!" "Long live world peace!" Countless red flags fluttering in the wind, and the colorful arches of various government agencies, factories, shops, and schools are reflected each other. At night, the festive lights on the main streets are brightly lit everywhere.
