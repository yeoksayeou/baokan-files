Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 25th:

	The first snowflakes of winter have already fallen in the Anshan area. The workers at the dozens of construction sites of Anshan Iron and Steel are, with a heroic spirit that fears no cold, determined to complete the final thirty-plus projects in the last month or so of the First Five-Year Plan.

	At the construction site of the medium plate mill, people are vigorously carrying out the work in the run-up to completion. The main equipment such as rolling mills and shears are almost completely installed, and soon it will be producing high-quality steel plates six to forty millimeters thick; this type of steel plate is urgently needed by China's automobile factories, shipyards, and boiler factories.

	Following the commissioning of the new No. 1 coke oven in October, the new No. 2 and No. 3 coke ovens are also about to start production or be completed.

	In the world-famous Dashiqiao magnesite mining area, a modern magnesite brick factory will soon be able to produce its first batch of heat-resistant magnesite bricks.

	The last project in the Dagushan iron ore mining area, the first phase of the flotation plant, will also start production before the end of the year.

	Inspired by the rectification campaign, tens of thousands of builders have extremely high enthusiasm for labor; even on dark nights with howling north winds, the construction sites are brightly lit and under intense construction.

    冒雪建鞍钢
    据新华社鞍山25日电
  鞍山地区已经飘下今冬的第一次雪花。鞍钢几十个建设工地上的职工正以不畏寒冷的英雄气魄，决心在第一个五年计划最后一个多月的时间内，最后建成三十多项工程。
    兴建中的中板厂工地上，人们正在起劲地干着竣工前夕的工作。轧钢机和剪断机等主要设备快安装完毕了，不久它将生产出六公厘到四十公厘厚的优质钢板；这种钢板是当前我国汽车厂、造船厂和锅炉厂急需的。
    继10月份新一号炼焦炉投入生产之后，新二号和新三号炼焦炉也即将开工生产或建成。
    在世界著名的大石桥镁矿区，近代化的镁砖厂不久就可以生产出第一批耐高热的镁砖。
    大孤山铁矿区的最后一个工程——浮游选矿厂的第一期工程，年底以前也将开工生产。
    为整风运动所鼓舞的数万名建设者，劳动热情非常高涨；即使在北风呼啸的黑夜里，工地上也是灯火辉煌，紧张施工。
