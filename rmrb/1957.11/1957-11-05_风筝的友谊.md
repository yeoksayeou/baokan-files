    Kite Friendship
    Zhang Di
    On October 16th, the famous Tianjin kite master, "Kite" Wei – Wei Yuantai, received a letter from his Soviet friend, Riga Cherkyatz. He leaned on his crutch and went to tell his closest relatives and friends, "My good friend has written to me again." Then, he asked someone to translate it for him and had his little granddaughter read it to him three or four times. At this moment, he would put down his work, pour a cup of tea, and listen while drinking... This has been his habit for over a year, whenever he receives a letter from this Soviet friend. The letter of October 16th read: “Dear Friend:
    Why haven't you written to me for so long? ... I hope everything is going well with you, that you are safe and sound, and in good health…
    "... What masterpieces or achievements have you had in your work lately? I am always eagerly awaiting your letter. The weather has been very nice in Kyiv recently, with flowers in full bloom. There are guests here from many countries, and I eagerly look forward to your visit. We will always welcome our friends, and our friendship with the Chinese people is as solid as a rock.
    "Please convey my sincere greetings to your son and wish him all the best. Has he inherited your excellent artistic skills? If not, then I hope he can succeed in doing so, knowing that labor is what we respect the most…
      "Write back! Write back! How can you forget your Soviet friends?" After listening to the letter, he immediately asked his son to write a reply for him. Eighty-five-year-old Wei Yuantai often proudly tells others, "My friend is so good! It is the most glorious thing in my life to have such a friend."
    Wei Yuantai's Soviet friend lives on Gogol Street in Kyiv. He has been writing to Wei Yuantai frequently since last year, and each letter praises his works (kites) as being very exquisite. In July of this year, Riga Cherkyatz wrote a letter to Wei Yuantai, but because Wei Yuantai was in Beijing attending the national conference of arts and crafts artists, he did not have time to reply. That is why his Soviet friend was concerned and asked why he had not replied.
    On October 24th, Wei Yuantai finished writing his reply. At the beginning of the letter, the old artist first expressed his heartfelt congratulations on the 40th anniversary of the great October Revolution and told his Soviet friend about his happy life and work.
    Now, the old artist is personally designing a kite pattern symbolizing Sino-Soviet friendship, which he plans to send to his friend far away.

    风筝的友谊
    张谛
    10月16日，天津著名老艺人风筝魏——魏元泰收到了他的苏联朋友里嘉·契尔基雅茨写来的信，他拄着拐杖去告诉他最好的亲友：“我的好朋友又来信了。”然后他找人去翻译，让他的小孙女三遍、四遍地念给他听。这时候，他放下手底下的活；倒杯茶，边喝着边听着……。这是他一年多以来的习惯了，他每逢接到这位苏联朋友的信时都如此。10月16日的来信中是这样写的：“敬爱的朋友：
    怎么这么久没给我来信？……我想你们一切都顺利和安好，身体健康……。
    “……您在工作中又有了什么得意杰作或成就？我无时不在翘盼来信。近来基辅天气很好，鲜花盛开，这里有来自许多国家的客人，我殷切期待您光临，我们永远欢迎我们的朋友的，我们同中国人民的友谊是坚如磐石的。
    “请您将我的诚挚的问候转致您的儿子，祝他一切顺利。他是否已继承了您卓越的艺术技巧？如果还没有的话，那么希望他能成功的做到这一点，须知劳动是我们最尊敬的，……
      “写回信！写回信！怎能把苏联朋友忘掉了呢？”他听完了这封信，马上要找他的儿子为他写回信。八十五岁的魏元泰经常骄傲地给别人念叨：“我这位朋友可好啦！能交上这样的朋友，这是我一辈子最光荣的一件事。”
    魏元泰的这位苏联朋友住在基辅城的果戈里大街，他从去年就经常给魏元泰写信，每封来信都赞扬他的作品（风筝）十分精巧。今年7月间里嘉·契尔基雅茨曾写给魏元泰一封信，因为那时魏元泰正去北京参加全国工艺美术艺人的代表会议，没有来得及回信。所以苏联朋友才关心地问他为什么没有回信。
    10月24日，魏元泰把回信写好了。老艺人在信的开头，首先为伟大的十月革命四十周年表示衷心的祝贺，并把自己的幸福生活和工作情况也告诉了他的苏联朋友。
    现在老艺人正亲自设计一个标志中苏友好的风筝图样，准备送给他的远方朋友。
