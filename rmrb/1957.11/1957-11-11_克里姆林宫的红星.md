    The Red Star of the Kremlin
    Luo Dagang

    A foreign friend told me this story: Once upon a time, in a prison of an oppressed nation, a tenacious revolutionary was locked up. He was isolated from the world and passed countless years. Spending long days in a dark cage, coupled with inevitable anxiety and poor diet, had blinded him, but his heart was not gloomy. Years of contemplation shone in his heart; it was as if a lamp illuminated his thoughts. But his wife suffered: she could never visit him. For years, she appealed and pleaded everywhere, wanting to visit him once, but was never allowed. But once, the rulers had a whim and said, "Let her see him, we might consider it, but during the meeting and conversation, she can only say three sentences." Okay, as long as she can see him, saying two fewer sentences doesn't matter. Separated by iron bars, the couple couldn't utter a word, holding hands tightly, such emotional silence! The blind man's lips trembled, he had something to say, listen to him:
  "Tell me, does the red star on top of the Kremlin keep radiating its brilliant light?" The wife said: "Yes, don't worry, the red star is always shining!" "That's good," the blind man said, "No need to ask anything else, no need to ask anything else... I am so happy!"

    Yes, this is an ordinary story, you may have heard it before. But it aroused my deep thought, again and again, and educated me with passion. It made me understand the 25,000-li Long March, how many martyrs and heroes, their eyes firmly fixed on their guide, the red star of the Kremlin. Inspiring and leading billions of revolutionary people, you, the red star of the October Revolution! You illuminate the arduous journey and the final victory, you illuminate the most sublime determination. How many people, from the edge of despair, from the depths of difficulty, immediately raise their heads, straighten their chests, and continue to move forward when they think of your radiance; you illuminate the footprints of heroes. You turned me from a selfish, shameful parasite into a soldier fighting for a noble ideal. I sometimes have lazy and negative emotions, I hope your light is a whip for me.

    克里姆林宫的红星
    罗大冈
    一一位国外的友人给我讲这一段故事：从前，在一个被压迫民族的监狱里，锁禁着一位顽强的革命志士。他和世界隔绝，经过了数不清的岁月。长期在阴暗的囚笼里打发日子，加上难免的焦虑和恶劣的饮食，使他双目失明，心里可并不阴沉。多年的沉思在他心中发光；好像有盏灯照亮他的思想。可苦了他的妻子：始终不能去探望。多少年来，她到处呼吁、求恳，想去探一次监，始终没有获准。可是有那么一回，统治者异想天开，说：“让她去见一面，倒可以考虑，只不过，见面交谈，话只许说三句。”好吧，能见面就行，少说两句话不要紧。隔着铁栅栏，夫妻俩说不出一句话，紧紧地拉着手，多么激动的沉默！盲人的嘴唇在哆嗦，他有话，你听他说：
  “告诉我，克里姆林宫顶上的红星，是不是一直在放射灿烂的光明？”妻子说：“是的，你放心，红星一直在发光！”“那就行，”盲人说，“别的不用多问，别的不用多问……我多么高兴！”
    二是的，这是一个平凡的故事，你也许听人讲过。但是它引起我深思，一次又一次，用热情教育了我。它使我明白二万五千里长征，多少先烈和英雄，眼光坚定地盯着他们的带路人，克里姆林宫的红星。鼓舞、带动几十亿革命的人民，你十月革命的红星！你照亮艰苦的历程和最终的胜利，你照亮最崇高的决心。多少人从绝望的边缘，从困难深处，一想起你光芒四射，马上就昂起头，挺起胸，继续前进；你照亮英雄们的脚印。你使我从一条自私
  可耻的寄生虫，变成为崇高理想而
  战斗的兵士。我有时还发生慵懒
  和消极的情绪，但愿你的光芒对于
  我是鞭子。
