Grasp the Key
——More on Rectification
Xu Bangyi

Rectification means to rectify work style and improve work. However, it is impossible to solve all problems in one movement. Among many problems, there will be primary and secondary, important and less important, big and small, urgent and slow, and solving these problems must be done in order. As a leader, one must be good at grasping the key in rectification. By grasping the key issues and solving them, some non-key issues will be solved along the way, or will be easier to solve. But this does not mean that by grasping the key issues, some non-key issues can be left unsolved. In real life, some problems that seem to be non-key, can have a great impact if solved well and reasonably, which can mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. The solution of such non-key problems will greatly help to solve the key problems. Therefore, in the rectification, we must not only grasp the key problems, but also pay attention to solving some non-key problems that should be solved and can be solved. The experience of rectification in some units shows that some specific problems related to life and welfare, which do not require spending money or only require a small amount of money, have been quickly solved in this rectification, with very good results and satisfactory responses from the masses. Practical experience is that as long as the leadership is determined, truly believes in the majority of the masses, believes in the wisdom and strength of the masses, this rectification will be more, faster, more stable, more accurate, more thorough, and better. And solving problems in the climax of the movement yields the greatest results, and this great opportunity should not be missed. Right-leaning conservative shortcomings, as well as frivolous and careless shortcomings, must also be overcome and prevented in the rectification.

The key issues in rectification will vary from unit to unit. However, as Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his report at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the current rectification should focus on the following three points: overcoming the tendencies of sectarianism and special treatment; changing some unreasonable provisions in the system and organization, appropriately adjusting the relationship between centralization and unity and division of responsibilities between the Party and government and between higher and lower levels; expanding democratic life within the people and continuing to improve the democratic system; these three points should not be lightly let go. These three points are precisely aimed at the more prominent shortcomings in our current work. It should be said that detachment from reality and detachment from the masses is one of the serious shortcomings that many of us have suffered from in recent years. To rectify, we must grasp this key issue and rectify it severely. The three points put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping have precisely grasped the key. To achieve these three points, it will definitely involve struggle. To solve the problems of organizational system, working methods, and leadership style, we must solve ideological problems, and we must also carry out ideological struggle. In this rectification, have we not also seen some leaders using bureaucracy to combat bureaucracy? Some people's airs are really not easy to put down. They even suppress criticism, ask secretaries to write self-criticisms, and write a few words on the masses' opinion forms such as "hand it over to so-and-so for handling," "let so-and-so explain," "transfer it to so-and-so for inspection" and consider the problem "solved." It can be seen that the disease of detachment from reality and detachment from the masses must be cured. As long as we cure this disease in the rectification, our work and cause will be new every day and new every month.

### 抓关键——再谈整改

    抓关键
    ——再谈整改
    许邦仪
    整改，就是要整顿作风和改进工作。不过，要把所有问题都在一次运动中求得解决，是做不到的。既有很多的问题，在很多的问题中就会有主有次、有轻有重、有大有小、有急有缓，解决这些问题就要有先有后。作为一个领导人员在整改中就要善于抓关键。抓住了关键问题加以解决，有一些不是关键性的问题，就会顺便解决，或者就会比较容易解决。但这决不是说，抓住了关键问题，有一些非关键性的问题就可以不解决。实际生活中有些看起来似乎是一个非关键性的问题，可是这一个问题解决得好，解决得合理，影响很大，可以发动群众的积极性，这种非关键性问题的解决，就会大大有助于解决关键性的问题。因此，在整改中既要抓住关键问题，又要注意解决应该解决、可以解决的一些非关键性的问题。有一些单位整改的经验说明了，有一些属于生活福利方面的具体问题，在这次整改中并不用花钱或者花钱并不多，迅速得到了解决，效果十分好，群众的反映很满意。实践的经验是：只要领导下决心，真正相信群众的大多数，相信群众的智慧和力量，这次整改就会改得多、改得快、改得稳、改得准、改得狠、改得好。而在运动的高潮中解决问题收效又最大，大好时机是不可以坐失的。右倾保守毛病以及轻浮和不谨慎的毛病，在整改中也是要克服和要防止的。
    整改中的关键问题，各单位会有不同。但是，邓小平同志在八届三中全会的报告中指出的，目前整改应集中于以下的三点，即克服宗派主义和特殊化的倾向；改变制度上和组织上的一些不合理的规定，适当地调整党政之间和上下之间的集中统一和分工负责的关系；在人民内部扩大民主生活，继续健全民主制度；这三点是不应轻轻放过去的。这三点正是针对着目前我们工作中比较突出的毛病而提出来的。应该说，脱离实际和脱离群众，这是我们许多人近年来所患有的严重毛病之一。要整改，就不能不抓住这一个关键性的问题狠狠地改。邓小平同志所提出来的三点，正是抓住了要害。要做到这三点，肯定是会经过斗争的。要解决组织制度、工作方法和领导作风的问题，就得要解决思想问题，也就得要开展思想斗争。在这次整改中，我们不是还看到有些领导人员是以官僚主义来反官僚主义吗？有些人的架子实在不容易放下，他们甚至压制批评，要秘书代写检讨，在群众的意见表上批几个字“交某人办理”、“由某人解释”、“转某人检查”就算把问题“解决”了。可见，脱离实际和脱离群众的病是不治不行的。我们在整改中只要治好了这一个病，我们的工作和事业，就会日日新、月月新。
