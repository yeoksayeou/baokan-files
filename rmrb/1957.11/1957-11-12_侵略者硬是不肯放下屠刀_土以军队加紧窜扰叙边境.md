    侵略者硬是不肯放下屠刀
    土以军队加紧窜扰叙边境
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：叙利亚军方宣布，连日来，土耳其和以色列的军队继续向叙利亚进行挑衅。
    在8日晚间，土耳其巡逻队曾经向卡米什利附近的两个叙利亚村庄特拉阿符特和特拉阿卡的居民开火。叙利亚人民抗敌军予以还击，相互射击达半小时之久，最后土耳其士兵被迫停火。同一天，在卡米什利以东的卡尔宗村附近的叙利亚领土上捕获了一名武装齐全的土耳其士兵。叙利亚当局已经同土耳其方面进行交涉来处理这一事件。
    在9日晚间，有三架国籍不明的飞机侵入拉塔基亚的上空。接着在10日，又有两架土耳其飞机侵犯叙利亚的领空，有一架飞过了阿勒颇以北的阿弗临上空，另一架飞越卡米什利附近的密丹·阿克巴斯上空。
    据叙利亚军方发言人9日说，土耳其军队最近派了援兵到叙利亚边境的阵地上去。分布在阵地上的土耳其士兵离叙利亚边界只有三英里。发言人又说，有许多美国军官在土耳其坦克部队中工作。
    据叙利亚军方10日晚发表的一个公报说，9日夜晚，以色列军事巡逻队曾经企图在贝尔贾亚特地区窜入叙利亚领土。巡逻队在入境一百公尺后遭到叙利亚边防军的射击而被迫退却。四小时后，另一以色列巡逻队又企图从同一地点窜入叙利亚国境，也遭受射击被迫退回去。
    叙利亚已经向联合国混合停战委员会提出控诉。
