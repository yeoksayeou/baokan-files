    Soviet Intercontinental Ballistic Rocket
    It is launched vertically from a small site, ascends beyond the atmosphere, flies according to a ballistic trajectory at an altitude of over a thousand kilometers, and then descends at a tremendous speed of 20,000 to 25,000 kilometers per hour.
    Introduction from the Soviet magazine "Science and Life"
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - The Soviet magazine "Science and Life" published an article in its October issue introducing the shape, structure, and launch of the Soviet intercontinental ballistic rocket.

    The article states that this rocket has no wings and is shaped like a cylinder several meters long with a streamlined, pointed tip. It is made of special heat-resistant materials. Inside, it is equipped with a powerful liquid-fuel jet engine, fuel and oxidizer tanks, and control system instruments.

    The entire intercontinental ballistic rocket consists of several stages. Each stage has an engine, fuel, and oxidizer. When it takes off, the engine of the first stage is activated. After a certain distance, as the fuel and oxidizer are depleted, this stage will automatically detach, and the remaining engine will continue to propel the lightened intercontinental ballistic rocket body.

    The ballistic rocket is launched vertically from a very small site. It rises to a great altitude, beyond the atmosphere, and flies a distance along a ballistic arc at an altitude of over a thousand kilometers, and then descends at a tremendous speed of twenty thousand to twenty-five thousand kilometers per hour. The transition after the vertical launch of the rocket is automatic.

    The article also mentioned the failures of the United States in testing intercontinental ballistic rockets. It said that many companies in the United States are engaged in research in this area. However, the United States' first launch of the "Atlas" ballistic rocket in June failed. According to a June report in the American "Aircraft" magazine, the rocket was originally scheduled to fly a distance of 3,200 kilometers with a maximum altitude of about 110 kilometers. However, the rocket only ascended four kilometers before it started to fall. The cost of this experimental rocket was five million US dollars. Not long ago, the United States conducted a second test, which also failed. The "Atlas" rocket exploded in the air shortly after launch.

    苏联洲际弹道火箭
    它从一个小场地垂直发射，升到大气圈以外，在一千多公里高空依据弹道曲线飞行，然后再以每小时二万至二万五千公里的巨大速度向下飞。
    苏联杂志“科学与生活”介绍
    新华社莫斯科20日电　苏联杂志“科学与生活”10月号登载一篇文章，介绍了苏联洲际弹道火箭的形状、结构和发射情况。
    文章说，这种火箭没有翅膀，形状像一个带流线型尖头的长数公尺的圆柱体。它是用特殊的耐高热材料制成的。体内装有马力强大的液体燃料喷气式发动机、燃料和氧化剂箱和控制系统仪器。
    整个洲际弹道火箭由几级火箭组成。每一级都有发动机、燃料和氧化剂。它起飞的时候开动第一级火箭的发动机，经过一定的距离后，随着燃料和氧化剂的耗尽，这一级火箭就会自动脱落，减轻了重量的洲际弹道火箭体就由余下的发动机继续推进。
    弹道火箭是从一个很小的场地上垂直发射的。它上升到很大的高度，超出了大气圈以外，并且在一千多公里的高空依据弹道弧形曲线飞行了一段路程，然后再以每小时两万到两万五千公里的巨大速度向下飞。火箭垂直起飞后的转变是自动进行的。
    这篇文章还谈到美国试验洲际弹道火箭失败的情况。它说，在美国有很多公司都在从事研究这方面的问题。但是，今年6月美国第一次发射“阿特拉斯”弹道火箭就失败了。据美国“飞机”杂志6月报道，这种火箭的飞行距离原定为三千二百公里，飞行的最大高度为一百一十公里左右。但是，火箭才上升了四公里就开始往下掉。这个试验用火箭的造价为五百万美元。不久前，美国进行第二次试验也失败了。“阿特拉斯”火箭升空后不一会就在空中爆炸了。
