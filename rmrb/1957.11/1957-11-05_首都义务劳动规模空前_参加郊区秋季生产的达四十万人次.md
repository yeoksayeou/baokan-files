Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - In the past two months, the capital's government offices, organizations, schools, and stationed troops have vigorously helped farmers in the Beijing suburbs with the autumn harvest and planting. From early September to now, more than 400,000 people have participated in voluntary labor. This unprecedented scale of voluntary labor is another revolutionary measure following the transfer of cadres to participate in agricultural production.

Those who volunteered to participate in voluntary labor included not only cadres, students, workers, and People's Liberation Army soldiers, but also scientists, writers, professors, doctors, and actors; government ministers, People's Liberation Army generals, and university presidents. Even some elderly members of democratic parties enthusiastically went to the fields to work with the farmers. During those days of intense autumn harvest and planting, the fields of suburban Beijing were almost full of people participating in voluntary labor. Every Sunday, the roads to the suburbs were filled with groups of volunteers. The most prominent feature of this year's voluntary labor is that, in addition to some units taking advantage of holidays to work in agricultural production cooperatives in the near suburbs for a day or half a day, many units have also drawn people out to pack their luggage, take their food and oil coupons, and stay in the countryside for five days, a week, half a month, or a month for longer-term labor. They ate, lived, and worked with the farmers in the countryside.

The people participating in voluntary labor showed great enthusiasm and initiative. Many had blisters on their hands and were so tired that their backs ached and their legs hurt, but they still insisted on working. One production team of the Air Force Logistics Department pushed a waterwheel for four hours one night, regardless of the fatigue of the day, and irrigated more than ten acres of land. When the officers and soldiers of a certain automobile company of the People's Liberation Army were doing voluntary labor in the Lidu Agricultural Cooperative in Beitaipingzhuang, they braved the rain to load manure onto the vehicles as quickly as possible in order to get the manure to the fields. "No loss, no leakage, every grain returned home" was the slogan of all participants in voluntary labor. The cooperative members believed that they harvested crops more carefully than the people they had hired in the past. Many cadres, after returning from the fields to the farmers' homes, the men would carry water and sweep the yard for the hosts, while the women would help with cooking and taking care of the children, and some would even help the farmers write letters. Doctors would treat patients when they encountered them. The farmers were very moved and said, "These people can work and labor, they are really good cadres of Chairman Mao and our old folks."

This army of voluntary labor played a great role in supporting the autumn production of suburban farmers. In addition to ensuring the timely harvesting and planting of crops, it also rushed to plant more than 300,000 mu of wheat in this year's drought. With the vigorous support of cadres from the directly affiliated organs of the CPC Central Committee, the Yongding Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Jingxi Mining Area was able to advance the autumn harvest by one month to one and a half months compared to last year, ensuring timely sowing of wheat. More than 15,000 people participated in voluntary labor at the four farms in the western suburbs of Nanyuan, with more than 30,000 workdays. These four farms hired more than 790 seasonal workers last year, but did not hire a single temporary worker this year. The Beijing Municipal Machinery Industry Company organized a voluntary farm tool repair team with 67 members, who carried their tools to agricultural cooperatives in five townships for more than 20 days of voluntary labor, repairing more than 2,000 pieces of various large and small farm tools such as tractors, chaff cutters, rice threshers, waterwheels, and seven-inch plows. The farmers were extremely grateful for this selfless assistance from the workers.

After a large number of cadres, students, and People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers participated in voluntary labor, the relationship between the Party, the government, the army, and the masses was further strengthened. In the labor, many cadres made friends with the farmers, and the farmers warmly took care of the cadres' lives and talked to them about their innermost thoughts. Many units established close relationships with agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs through labor, and often exchanged correspondence. Some cadres of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League sometimes used holidays to visit farmer friends in the Huangtugang Agricultural Cooperative where they had worked, and farmers sometimes came to the offices in the city to buy and sell things and chat with cadres. A female cadre who became ill while doing voluntary labor and returned to the office was visited by her landlord, an old man, who brought her eggs to the city. The Xishan Township Agricultural Production Cooperative now receives calls from government offices and schools almost every Sunday, asking what work needs to be done.

The active and conscientious attitude of the cadres, students, and People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers in participating in voluntary labor had a positive impact on the farmers. The members of the Yongding Agricultural Cooperative in the Jingxi Mining Area said, "They don't eat a bite of our food, and they work so carefully and conscientiously, just like they are working for themselves. We would be wrong if we didn't take good care of our cooperative." Originally, only three women in the rice field production team of this cooperative participated in production. After the fourteen female comrades from the directly affiliated organs of the Central Committee participated in voluntary labor in this team, seventeen women have gone to the fields to work. The attendance rate of members of the Youyi Agricultural Cooperative in Kandan Township, Fengtai District, has increased from 70% to 90%.

The people who participated in voluntary labor also received a profound education in the labor. They generally reflected that they now truly understood the meaning of the saying "Who knows that every grain on the plate is the result of hard work." After returning to their offices, cadres from many units of the directly affiliated organs of the CPC Central Committee automatically launched a movement to save food without being mobilized, and the phenomenon of casually spilling and discarding rice and vegetables in the canteen was greatly reduced. Some students from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School saw that the lives of the farmers were so arduous and simple, and felt that they should learn from the farmers and no longer make a fuss about fame, status, rank, and treatment. Some cadres or students who had never been to the countryside saw the flourishing scene of the countryside after cooperation and were greatly encouraged. Many people said: In a few more years, the face of the countryside will be even better than it is now! Many cadres who participated in voluntary labor also personally saw the struggle between the two roads in the countryside and received a profound class education.

Now, many staff members of government offices are very interested in participating in voluntary labor, and many have asked the organization to make voluntary labor a system. According to the person in charge of the Voluntary Labor Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, they are now further systematically studying how to better organize government cadres, students, and troops to participate in voluntary labor in the future, and preparing to gradually regularize voluntary labor and form a system.

### 首都义务劳动规模空前  参加郊区秋季生产的达四十万人次

    首都义务劳动规模空前
    参加郊区秋季生产的达四十万人次
    新华社3日讯　首都的机关、团体、学校以及驻京部队在过去两个月内，大力帮助北京郊区农民进行秋收秋种。从9月上旬至今参加义务劳动的达四十多万人次。这个空前规模的义务劳动，是继下放干部参加农业生产以后又一个革命措施。
    自动报名参加义务劳动的，不但有干部、学生、工人和解放军的战士，还有科学家、作家、教授、医生和演员，有政府的部长、人民解放军的将军、高等学校的校长，有些年迈的民主党派的成员，也热情地走到田间和农民一起劳动。在紧张的秋收秋种的那些日子，京郊的田野里几乎满布着参加义务劳动的人群。每逢星期天，通往郊区的公路上参加义务劳动者更是成群结队。今年进行义务劳动最突出的特点是：除有些单位利用假日在近郊农业生产合作社作一天或半天的活外，很多单位都抽出人来背起行李、拿着粮票油票到农村住下来，进行五天、一周、半月或一个月的较长期的劳动。他们在农村和农民同吃同住同劳动。
    参加义务劳动的人表现了极大的热情和积极性，很多人手上磨起了泡，累的腰酸腿痛也不休息，仍然坚持劳动。空军后勤部的一个生产小队在一天晚上，不顾白天的疲劳又推了四个小时的水车，浇地十余亩。解放军某部汽车连的官兵在北太平庄丽都农业社进行义务劳动时，为了把粪尽快地送到地里，曾冒雨向车上装粪。“不丢不漏、颗粒还家”是所有参加义务劳动者的口号，社员们认为他们收拾庄稼比过去花钱雇的人还仔细。很多干部从地里回到农家后，男的给主人担水扫院子，女的则帮助作饭，抱孩子，有的还帮助农民代写书信。医生遇到病人时就给他看病。农民很感动地说：“这些人能工作也能劳动，真是毛主席和咱老百姓的好干部。”
    这批义务劳动大军在支援郊区农民秋季生产中发挥了很大的作用。除保证了作物的及时收储和种植外，并在今年缺雨的情况下抢种了三十余万亩小麦。京西矿区永定农业生产合作社在中共中央直属机关干部的大力支援下，使秋收较去年提前一个月到一个半月，保证小麦适时进行了播种。参加西郊南苑等四个农场义务劳动的有一万五千多人，出工三万多个。这四个农场去年雇季节工七百九十多人，今年一个临时工也没雇。北京市机械工业公司所组织的工人义务修理农具队，共有六十七个队员，他们背着工具分别到五个乡的农业社进行了二十多天的义务劳动，共修理拖拉机、铡草机、打稻机、水车、七吋步犁等各种大小农具二千多件。农民对工人的这种无私援助极为感激。
    大批干部、学生和解放军官兵参加义务劳动后，进一步密切了党、政府和军队同群众的关系。在劳动中很多干部和农民交了朋友，农民们热情地照顾干部的生活起居，心里话也向干部谈。很多单位同郊区的农业生产合作社通过劳动，建立了亲密的关系，经常来往通信。共青团中央有些干部有时利用假日到劳动过的黄土岗农业社去看望农民朋友，农民进城来买卖东西有时也到机关里找干部叙谈。有个女干部义务劳动时得病回了机关，她的房东老大爷曾提着鸡蛋到城里来看她。西山乡农业生产合作社现在几乎每个星期天都接到机关、学校的电话，询问有什么活要干。
    干部、学生和解放军官兵在参加义务劳动中，所表现的积极认真的劳动态度，在农民中发生了良好的影响。京西矿区永定农业社的社员说：“他们不吃我们一点饭，干活这样仔细认真，就像给自己干活一样，咱们再不好好爱护自己的合作社就不对了。”这个合作社稻地生产队原来只有三个妇女参加生产，中央直属机关的十四个女同志到这个队参加义务劳动后，已有十七个妇女下地生产。丰台区看丹乡友谊农业社社员的出勤率由原来的70％，上升到90％。
    参加义务劳动的人，也在劳动中受到了一次深刻的教育。他们普遍反映：现在才真正懂得“谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦”这句话的道理。中共中央直属机关很多单位的干部回到机关后，未经动员就自动展开了节约粮食的运动，食堂里随便撒抛饭菜的现象大大减少了。全国总工会干部学校的一些学员看到农民的生活是那么艰苦朴素，觉得应该向农民学习，再不该闹什么名誉地位级别待遇了。有些从来没有下过乡的干部或学生，在参加劳动后亲眼看到了合作化后农村欣欣向荣的景象，受到很大鼓舞，很多人说：再过几年农村面貌比现在就更好了！许多参加义务劳动的干部还亲自看到农村中两条道路斗争的情形，受到了一次深刻的阶级教育。
    现在很多机关的工作人员对参加义务劳动感到极大的兴趣，很多人向组织上提出把义务劳动订成制度。据北京市人民委员会义务劳动办公室负责人对新华社记者说，他们现在正进一步系统的研究今后如何更好地组织机关干部、学生、部队参加义务劳动，准备使义务劳动逐步走向经常化，形成一种制度。
