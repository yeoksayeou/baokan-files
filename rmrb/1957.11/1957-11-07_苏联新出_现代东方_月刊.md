    Soviet Union Launches New Monthly Magazine "Modern Orient"

    "Modern Orient" is the organ of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a scientific and socio-economic monthly magazine, with B.G. Gafurov and N.N. Poliankov serving as editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief, respectively.

    In the inaugural issue published in July, the editorial department pointed out that the main task of "Modern Orient" is to explain the current political and economic situation in the countries of the Orient. It serves scientists, teachers, propagandists, Party and Soviet activists, as well as undergraduates and graduate students studying Oriental issues.

    "Modern Orient" particularly emphasizes the study of the further deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, especially the collapse of the colonial system in the Orient and the increasingly sharp contradictions between the imperialists in the Orient. It will devote a large amount of space to publicizing the experience of the socialist construction of the Soviet Union's Eastern republics and the achievements made in the economic and cultural fields, extensively expounding the issue of socialist construction in the Asian people's democratic countries, introducing the achievements of the Eastern countries that have gained independence and the general situation of their economic and cultural development, explaining the situation of the Asian and African people's struggle for peace, freedom and independence, and introducing the research results of Oriental studies in various countries.

    In the inaugural issue, seven papers were published. In the article "The July Revolution is a New Stage in Egyptian History," the author pointed out the significance of this revolution for the national liberation movement in Arab countries and concluded that the abolition of the monarchy has promoted Egypt's socio-economic development and strengthened Egypt's role in international affairs. In addition to papers, the inaugural issue also includes columns such as Introduction to Eastern Countries, Book Reviews, Foreign Magazine Reviews, Scientific and Cultural Life, Chronicle of Major Events in the Orient, and Literature. In order to better reflect the life of Eastern countries, this issue also contains many interesting illustrations. (Quan Di)
