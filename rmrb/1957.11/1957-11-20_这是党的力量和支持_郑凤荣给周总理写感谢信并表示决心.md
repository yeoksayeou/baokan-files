    This is the Strength and Support of the Party
    Zheng Fengrong Writes a Letter of Gratitude to Premier Zhou and Expresses Determination
    Xinhua News Agency, November 19th. The day after Zheng Fengrong broke the women's high jump world record by jumping 1.77 meters (November 18th), she wrote a letter to Premier Zhou to thank the Communist Party for nurturing her. The following is the full text of the letter:
    "Respected Premier Zhou:
    Hello!
    With great excitement, I report to you that on the morning of the 17th, I jumped a height of 1.77 meters in Beijing, breaking the women's high jump world record held by the American athlete McDaniel.
    Since you met with me on October 20th, I have felt a tremendous force urging and supporting me every day, wanting me to complete my task for this year, which is to break the world record. Because your encouragement embodies the Party's, the government's, and the people's meticulous care and cultivation of us athletes. When I jumped over 1.77 meters, I was excited that a new world record had appeared for the motherland, and I also felt happy that I had fulfilled the requirement you had set for me.
    I have been able to transform from an ordinary daughter of the working people, a junior high school student who liked the high jump, into a creator of world records, entirely due to the Party's kind cultivation and nurturing of me over the past few years. I sincerely thank the Party, and I also thank you – respected Premier.
    On the night of the 17th, I couldn't sleep well. I thought about many things. I feel that although the world record has been broken, the task before me is even more arduous. In the future, how much hard work should I put in to improve my results by one centimeter? Currently, I am preparing to enter winter for comprehensive training to prepare for next year's competitions. I am determined to work hard to improve my political awareness in the rectification movement, study hard, correct my shortcomings, and be an excellent athlete who truly meets the requirements of the Party and the people.
    I wish you good health!
                             Zheng Fengrong
                           November 18th” (Attached picture)

    这是党的力量和支持
    郑凤荣给周总理写感谢信并表示决心
    新华社19日讯　郑凤荣在跳过一·七七公尺创造了女子跳高世界最高纪录的第二天（18日），写信给周总理感谢共产党对她的培养。下面是这封信的全文：
    “敬爱的周总理：
    您好！
    我怀着激动的心情向您报告：17日上午，我在北京跳过了一·七七公尺的高度，打破了由美国运动员麦克丹尼尔所保持的女子跳高世界纪录。
    自从10月20日您接见了我之后，我就感到有一股巨大的力量每天在督促着我、支持着我，要我完成自己今年的任务，即打破世界纪录。因为您对我的勉励，正是体现着党、政府和全国人民对我们运动员无微不至的关怀和培养。当我跳过一·七七公尺之后，我为祖国出现一项新的世界纪录而兴奋，也为自己实现了您对我提出的要求而感到幸福。
    我能够从一个普通的劳动人民的女儿、喜欢跳高运动的一个初中学生，变成一个世界纪录的创造者，这完全是由于我们的党几年来对我亲切的培养和抚育。我衷心地感谢党，也感谢您——敬爱的总理。
    17日夜里，我怎么也睡不好。我想了很多事。我感到世界纪录虽然打破了，但放在我面前的任务却是更加艰巨了。今后每提高一公分的成绩，我应该付出多么艰苦的劳动。目前，我准备进入冬季全面训练，迎接明年的比赛。我决心在整风运动中努力提高自己的政治觉悟，努力学习，改正缺点，做一个真正符合党和人民所要求的优秀运动员。
    敬祝您健康！
                             郑凤荣
                           11月18日”（附图片）
