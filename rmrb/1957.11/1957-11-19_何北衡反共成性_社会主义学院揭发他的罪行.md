    He Beiheng's Anti-Communist Nature
    Socialist Academy Exposes His Crimes
    (Xinhua News Agency) The Socialist Academy has held successive conferences to expose and criticize the rightist He Beiheng's consistent anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist crimes.
    He Beiheng slandered and fundamentally negated the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movements. He said that he had gleaned three "laws" from these movements: First, he said these movements all exaggerated facts and fabricated them out of thin air; second, he said these exaggerated and fabricated facts had to be forced upon people for admission, otherwise, one could not pass the test; third, he said those who were struggled against in these movements were all good people who were willing to work and dared to take responsibility, and the result of the movements was to make everyone afraid to work.
    He Beiheng also tried his best to provoke the relationship between non-Party members and the Communist Party, and to provoke the relationship between the people and the government. He slandered the Communist Party's treatment of non-Party members as "not even as good as the treatment of waste," saying, "Cow urine and horse dung are still usable, let alone people." He Beiheng also tried his best to slander and attack the broad masses of grassroots cadres and grassroots work, saying that "the deviation of lower-level cadres is so great that it is incalculable, like astronomical figures."
    He Beiheng was a faithful running dog of landlords, comprador bourgeoisie, imperialism, and feudal warlords. He came from a despotic landlord family and colluded closely with Liu Xiang, Wang Lingji, and others for a long time, becoming a prominent figure on the reactionary political stage in Sichuan. He served as the director of the Chongqing Municipal Police Bureau, the director of the Construction Department, a member of the provincial government, and an executive member of the Kuomintang Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters. According to reports, He Beiheng started engaging in anti-Communist and anti-people criminal activities very early on: In 1925, he initiated the "Militia" in Sichuan, massacring peasants; in 1934, when the Red Army moved north and entered Sichuan, he "requested to kill the enemy" and personally went to Lushan to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, requesting that troops be sent to Sichuan; from 1930 to 1934, he served as a member of the "Committee for Clearing Communists." According to the revelations of students Qin Dejun, Zhou Zongqiong, and others at the conference, He Beiheng was the main planner of the "March 31st" massacre in Sichuan in 1927. This massacre shot and killed a large number of young students and revolutionaries and, after the fact, captured and killed Yang Angong, then the secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    何北衡反共成性
    社会主义学院揭发他的罪行
    据新华社讯　社会主义学院连续举行大会，揭露和批判右派分子何北衡一贯反共反人民反社会主义的罪恶言行。
    何北衡诬蔑并根本否定三反、五反和肃反运动。他说从这些运动中摸到了三条“规律”：一、他说这些运动都是夸大事实，无中生有；二、他说这些夸大的、无中生有的事实，一定要逼着人承认，否则就不能过关；三、他说在这些运动中被斗争的都是肯作事敢负责任的好人，运动的结果是造成大家都不敢作事。
    何北衡还极力挑拨非党人士和共产党的关系，挑拨人民群众和政府的关系。他诬蔑共产党对待非党人士“尚不如对待废物”，说什么“牛溲马勃尚可利用，而况人乎”。何北衡还极力诬蔑和攻击广大基层干部和基层工作，他说“下面干部偏差之大是无法计算的，犹如天文数字”。
    何北衡是一个地主、买办资产阶级和帝国主义、封建军阀的忠实走狗。他出身于恶霸地主家庭，长期同刘湘、王陵基等密切勾结，成为四川反动政治舞台上的显赫人物。曾担任过重庆市警察局长、建设厅长、省府委员、国民党四川省党部执行委员等职务。据揭露，何北衡很早就干起反共反人民的罪恶活动：1925年他在四川倡办“民团”，屠杀农民；1934年红军北上进入四川时，他“请缨杀敌”，并亲到庐山会见蒋介石，请求派兵入川；1930年—1934年间他一直担任“清共特务委员会”的委员。据学员秦德君、周宗琼等人在大会上揭露，何北衡是1927年四川“三·三一”惨案的主要策划人，这次惨案枪杀了大批青年学生和革命人士，并在事后捕杀了当时中共四川省委书记杨暗公。
