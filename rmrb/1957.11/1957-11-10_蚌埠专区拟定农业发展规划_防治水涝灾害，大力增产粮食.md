    Bengbu Special Zone Formulates Agricultural Development Plan
    Preventing Waterlogging Disasters and Vigorously Increasing Grain Production
    (Our report) The Bengbu Special Zone of Anhui Province has formulated an agricultural development plan for the entire special zone based on the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). This plan requires that by 1962, grain production in the Huaibei region will increase from the current yield of 200 jin per mu to 619 jin per mu; and in the Huainan region, from the current 305 jin per mu to 852 jin per mu.
    The person in charge of the Bengbu Special Zone told reporters that in formulating this plan, they analyzed the natural conditions of the entire zone. In the nine years since liberation, the zone experienced three major floods, three minor floods, and three years of good harvests with some deficiencies. There were also multiple droughts during the nine years, leading to reductions in grain crop production. The reasons for these disasters are: first, rainfall is concentrated; second, the terrain is flat, and the river channels are shallow, causing floods to rise quickly and recede slowly, with long flood durations; third, the drainage engineering is poor, preventing timely drainage and irrigation during droughts; fourth, the crops planted are mainly dryland crops that are not resistant to waterlogging, which is not adapted to the local rainfall conditions.
    In formulating this plan, the special zone believed that the main measures for increasing production were to build water conservancy projects, which must combine flood control and drainage with water storage and crop conversion. During the Second Five-Year Plan, it is required to reinforce the Huaibei Dam to be able to prevent major floods that occur once in a century, and to repair other major rivers in Huaibei to meet the standard of preventing floods that occur once in ten years. In the low-lying areas along the Huai River, four irrigation and drainage stations will be established for flood drainage. At the same time, ditches will be dug, ponds will be excavated, and enclosures and wells will be built in the Huaibei area, as well as the construction of small reservoirs and gully dams. In the next five years, the water conservancy projects will ensure that the Huaibei area will no longer be affected by floods under normal flood conditions, and the irrigated area will reach more than 70% of the total area of Huaibei, of which 6.2 million mu will be converted into paddy fields. In the Huainan area, efforts will be made to dig ponds, build gully dams, and reservoirs to increase water storage and irrigation area. Currently, only more than 500,000 mu of the more than 6 million mu of paddy fields in the Huainan area are guaranteed harvest. By 1962, the goal is not only to ensure a guaranteed harvest for all paddy fields but also to expand the rice planting area by more than 1 million mu. The result of water conservancy construction will increase the multiple cropping index of the entire zone to 182.83%, and the yield per unit area of wheat, soybeans, and other crops will be more than doubled.
    In terms of fertilizer, it is necessary to change the masses' habit of accumulating fertilizer and build a large number of toilets and livestock pens. By 1962, 20 million mu of green manure will be planted, and all winter fallow fields will be planted with green manure. The average number of pigs raised per household will reach two and a half. The plan estimates that the implementation of the above methods will provide sufficient fertilizer for the land in the entire zone.
    The Bengbu Special Zone has also made plans for breeding draught animals, improving varieties, and promoting new agricultural tools.
    The person in charge of the special zone said that by 1962, when the plan is realized, each person in the Huaibei area will be able to obtain an average of more than 1,970 jin of grain per year, plus an income of 20 yuan from sideline occupations, resulting in an income of 170 yuan; each person in the Huainan area will have more than 2,340 jin of grain. The income of farmers in the entire zone will exceed the level of well-to-do middle peasants. The person in charge said that the realization of the above plan is conditional because the planned average yield for 1962 has already been achieved in many places. He said that the scale of water conservancy construction this winter and next spring will be very large, which is the first step in realizing this plan. The original requirement for earth and stone work this winter and next spring was more than 320 million cubic meters, which is more than double the amount from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956. Considering the labor force, if the entire semi-labor force accounts for 52% of the population, there are 3.85 million laborers. With an attendance rate of 80%, there are 3 million people. If each person works 80 workdays, it can be done in more than 240 million workdays. If each laborer does 1.3 cubic meters of earth per day, 330 million cubic meters of earth can be moved. As long as the masses are fully mobilized, this number can be greatly exceeded. If we add the support from the state in various aspects, there will be more favorable conditions.

### 蚌埠专区拟定农业发展规划  防治水涝灾害，大力增产粮食

    蚌埠专区拟定农业发展规划
    防治水涝灾害，大力增产粮食
    本报讯　安徽省蚌埠专区，已经根据全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）拟定了全专区的农业发展规划。这个规划要求：淮北地区到1962年的粮食产量由现在的单位产量二百斤，提高到六百一十九斤；淮南地区由现在的三百零五斤，提高到八百五十二斤。
    蚌埠专区的负责人告诉记者，在拟定这个规划时，他们曾对全区的自然条件进行了分析。这个专区在解放以来的九年中，就有三年大涝灾，三年小涝灾，另外三年则是丰中有歉；九年中还有多次旱灾，形成粮食作物的减产。造成这些灾害的原因，一是雨量集中；二是地势平坦，河槽浅，洪水一来，涨得快，落得慢，洪水持续时间长；三是沟洫工程差，不能及时排水，旱时又不能灌溉；四是种植的作物是以不耐涝的旱粮作物为主，不能和当地雨水的情况相适应。
    这个专区在拟定规划时，认为主要的增产措施，是兴修水利，而水利工程必须采取以除涝防洪和蓄水改种相结合的办法。在第二个五年计划中，要求把淮北大堤加固到能防百年一遇的大水，对淮北的其他大河道要修到能防十年一遇的大水标准，在沿淮洼地则设立四处灌排站进行排涝。与此同时，将在淮北地区挖沟，挖塘，打圩、造井，并建造小型水库、谷坊等。未来五年的水利工程，要使淮北地区在普通洪水的情况下，不再受涝，受灌溉的面积达到淮北地区总面积的70％以上，其中有六百二十万亩变成水稻田。在淮南地区则是大力进行挖塘、建立谷坊、水库，以增加蓄水灌溉面积。现在淮南地区的六百多万亩水稻只有五十多万亩保收，到1962年要作到不但使全部水稻田保收，还要再扩大一百多万亩的水稻种植面积。兴修水利的结果，将使全区复种指数提高到182．83％，小麦、大豆等的单位产量提高一倍以上。
    在肥料方面，要改变群众积肥习惯，大量修建厕所和牲畜圈。到1962年，种二千万亩绿肥，冬闲田都种上绿肥，每户养猪平均达到两头半。在规划中估计，实行以上办法，便可使全区土地有足够的肥料。
    蚌埠专区对繁殖耕畜、改良品种和推广新式农具等方面也作了规划。
    这个专区的负责人说，到1962年，规划实现时，淮北地区每人每年即可平均得到一千九百七十多斤粮食，再加二十元副业收入，即有一百七十元的收入；淮南地区每人将有二千三百四十多斤粮食。全区农民的收入将可超过富裕中农水平。这位负责人说，实现以上的规划是有条件的，因为1962年的计划平均产量，目前有很多地方已经达到了。他说，今冬明春兴修水利的规模很大，是实现这个规划的第一步。今冬明春原要求作土石方三亿二千多万方，比1955年冬到1956年春已提高一倍多。再算算劳力，全区整半劳力以占人口的52％计，即有三百八十五万个劳动力，以80％的出勤率算，即有三百万人，每人做八十个工作日，即可做到二亿四千多万个工作日，一天每个劳动力作一点三方土，即可做三亿三千万方土。只要把群众充分发动起来，还可大大超过此数。如再加上国家的各方面支援，有利条件就更多了。
