Xinhua News Agency report: Factories and mines in Shanxi Province, which started the rectification and socialist education movement earlier, have recently convened employee representative assemblies one after another. Relying on the masses, they have taken swift and decisive action to address the opinions raised by employees during the "Great Airing of Views." Furthermore, they are further promoting employees to "thoroughly air" and "thoroughly express" their views.

In the past month, several major state-owned factories and mines in Shanxi, including the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Jingwei Textile Machinery Plant, the Seventh Metallurgical Construction Corporation, and the Taiyuan North Station of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, have successively convened employee representative assemblies. They discussed issues such as handling the opinions raised by employees and continuing to mobilize employees to extensively air their views, and made corresponding resolutions. The employee representative assembly of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant put forward many methods for improving leadership and work by relying on the masses in the discussion. Seven units handled more than 150 opinions during the conference. The Taiyuan North Station employees raised more than 5,000 opinions during the "Airing of Views." In order to quickly handle these opinions, they convened an employee representative assembly on September 26th and organized employee representative inspection teams to go deep into the workshops to urge various units to rely on the masses to handle more than 1,000 opinions. Later, cadres at the station and workshop levels classified and summarized the 3,700 remaining opinions that needed to be addressed, distinguishing between station-level and workshop-level issues. For opinions that fell under the station's responsibility, after studying and proposing preliminary handling measures, they convened a second employee representative assembly on October 26th and submitted them to the assembly for discussion. During the meeting, employee representatives were entrusted to take the handling measures back to the workers for discussion, soliciting their opinions on the handling measures. Then, the workers' opinions were collected and further discussed, a resolution was made, and then it was implemented. Issues that fell under the workshop's responsibility were discussed separately at meetings of production team leaders and trade union group leaders, and after reaching a consensus, specific personnel were assigned to handle them. After the two employee representative assemblies, the opinions raised by the employees of the Taiyuan North Station, except for issues that needed to be debated, have been basically resolved, achieving "no mistakes, no sloppiness, and no omissions."

    迅速处理职工鸣放中提出的意见
    山西厂矿陆续召开职工代表大会
    新华社讯  山西省整风和社会主义教育运动开展较早的工矿企业，最近陆续召开了职工代表大会，依靠群众雷厉风行地处理职工在大鸣大放中提出的意见。并且进一步推动职工鸣透、放透。
    最近一个月以来，山西的一些主要国营厂矿，包括太原钢铁厂、太原矿山机器厂、经纬纺织机器厂、第七冶金建筑总公司和太原铁路管理局所属太原北站等，都先后召开了职工代表大会，讨论了处理职工提出的意见和继续发动职工大鸣大放等问题，并且都做了相应的决议。太原钢铁厂的职工代表大会在讨论中提出许多依靠群众改进领导和改进工作的办法。有七个单位在大会进行期间就处理了一百五十多条意见。太原北站职工在鸣放中曾提出了五千多条意见，为了迅速处理这些意见，曾在9月26日召开了一次职工代表大会，会后并组织了职工代表检查小组，深入车间督促各单位依靠群众处理了一千多条意见。后来站和车间两级的干部又把需要处理的三千七百多条意见进行了分类归纳，把站、车间的问题区分出来，属于站一级处理的意见，经研究提出了初步处理的措施以后，又在10月26日召开了第二次职工代表大会，提交大会讨论。在会议进行中间，还委托职工代表把处理措施带回工人中进行了讨论，征求工人对处理措施的意见，然后把工人的意见集中起来进行了进一步讨论，作出决议，然后贯彻执行。属于车间一级处理的问题就分别召开生产小组长和工会小组长会议进行讨论，取得一致意见后，指定专人处理。经过两次职工代表大会，太原北站职工们提出的意见除需要争辩的问题外，已经基本处理完毕，作到了“不错、不草、不漏”。
