Why Rectification Cannot Keep Up with Airing of Views
Zhang Jing

Recently, in the rectification movement of state organs, after the large-scale airing of views was launched, a more common phenomenon has emerged: the speed of rectification work is far behind the progress of airing views. Specifically, there are more problems aired than problems solved. The Ministry of Chemical Industry, after summarizing more than 20,000 opinions, had only rectified 2,820 by the 16th, accounting for 13.1%. The worst performer was the Ministry of Health. The masses posted a total of 729 big-character posters, but by the 23rd of this month, only 50 had been rectified, accounting for only 6.8% of the total number of opinions. This slow and inactive state of affairs has caused dissatisfaction among many comrades in the Ministry of Health. They posted big-character posters to question: Since the airing of views, the walls are full of opinions, but how is the rectification progressing? Is the leadership lagging behind the masses? Or is it that the rectification situation has not been announced in a timely manner?

Why is rectification not keeping up with the airing of views? The objective reason is that the tens of thousands of opinions put forward by the masses in a few days cover a wide range of issues. There are small problems that are relatively easy to solve, and there are also major problems related to the overall situation. The thorough resolution of major problems must go through careful research and seek appropriate solutions through mass debate. This requires a relatively long process. It is impossible to rectify all major problems in a few days.

However, the current phenomenon of rectification lagging behind the airing of views is more due to subjective reasons. It can also be said that this is a manifestation of the leadership lagging behind the masses. For example, the rectification leading groups of some units have not yet focused their energy on improving their work. Take the Ministry of Health as an example. The rectification leading group of the ministry held three meetings in the half month since the transition to rectification, and none of them seriously studied how to improve work. Many problems that could be rectified immediately have not been resolved. The leadership's procrastination in rectification objectively hinders the airing of views by the masses. The sudden decline in the number of big-character posters and the lack of enthusiasm for thematic airing of views in the Ministry of Health a few days ago, is it not a direct consequence of the leadership's slow rectification action?

In addition to the lack of determination from the leadership, another subjective reason is that the method of rectification is not correct. Many units have a lot of energy for rectification, but due to lack of experience, they do not know where to start in the face of thousands of opinions. Although they spend time and energy, the effect is not great. For example, the Communications and Electrical Company under the Ministry of Commerce initially emphasized studying the opinions of the masses one by one. The leading group held meetings until late at night every day to study improvement methods, but the rectification was still very slow. Later, they changed their approach and handed over the opinions related to the various units of the company to each unit to study and improve methods, and urged them to announce them to the masses in a timely manner. The leading group then freed up energy to study the improvement plans for more important issues. In this way, the progress of rectification was greatly accelerated. In less than half a month, not only were the problems that could be rectified basically rectified, but also every problem that could not be rectified temporarily was explained.

To change the current phenomenon of rectification not keeping up with the airing of views, according to existing experience, the key lies in the leadership's determination to take action personally and earnestly rely on the masses to launch the masses to rectify.

### 整改为什么跟不上鸣放

    整改为什么跟不上鸣放
    张竞
    近来，国家机关的整改运动，在大规模鸣放热潮掀起来以后，出现了一个较普遍的现象：整改工作的速度远远跟不上鸣放的进展。具体说来，就是鸣放的问题多，解决的问题少。化工部经过归纳的二万多条意见，到16日为止，只改了二千八百二十条，占13．1％。改得最差的像卫生部，群众一共贴出七百二十九张大字报，到本月23日为止，只改了五十条，仅仅占意见总数的6．8％。这种迟迟不行动的落后状态，已经引起了卫生部许多同志的不满，他们贴大字报责问：鸣放以来，意见满墙，但改得如何呢？是领导落后于群众？还是没有及时公布整改情况？
    整改为什么跟不上鸣放？客观原因是群众在几天之内提出的千万条意见，牵涉面很广，有比较容易解决的小问题，也有关系全局的重大问题，而重大问题的彻底解决，必须经过慎重的研究，并通过群众的大争大辩而后寻求出妥善的办法，这就需要一个较长的过程。企图在几天之内就把一切重大的问题统统改好，这是不可能的。
    可是，目前发生的整改落后于鸣放的现象，更多的原因是主观上造成的。也可以说这是领导落后于群众的表现。如有些单位的整风领导小组，至今还没有把精力放在改进工作上去。就说卫生部吧，该部的整风领导小组，从转入整改以后的半个月内，开过三次会议，没有一次认真研究过如何改进工作的问题。许多明明马上可以改的问题没有下决心去改。领导上对整改工作的拖拉作风，客观上对群众鸣放起了一种阻碍作用。像卫生部前几天大字报数量剧然下降，专题鸣放劲头不足的情况，难道不正是领导上整改行动迟缓的直接后果吗？
    除了领导决心不足以外，另一个主观原因就是改的方法不对头。不少单位改的劲头挺大，但由于缺乏经验，在千千万万条意见面前，不知从何着手去改，虽然花费了时间精力，但事倍功半，效果不大。像商业部所属的交电公司，起初因强调逐条研究群众意见，领导小组每天开会到深夜，研究改进办法，结果仍然改得很慢。后来，他们改变了做法，把有关本公司各单位的意见，分别交给各单位自己去研究改进办法，并督促他们及时向群众公布，领导小组就腾出了精力去研究比较重要问题的改进方案，这样做，改的进度大大加快。不到半个月，不仅把能改的问题基本上改好，暂时不能改的问题也条条作了交代。
    要改变目前整改跟不上鸣放的现象，根据已有的经验，关键还在于领导下决心亲自动手，并且认真依靠群众发动群众来整改。
