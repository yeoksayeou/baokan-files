The Struggle Between Bourgeois Nationalism and Socialism is a Struggle Between Two Roads

Nationalism is a reflection of bourgeois ideology on the national question. Starting from the bourgeois nationalist view of the nation, a bourgeois program and policy for the national question will arise. The bourgeois program and policy for the national question proceed from the narrow class interests of the bourgeoisie. Within the nation, it seeks to subordinate the interests of the entire people to the interests of one class; between nations, it seeks to set the interests of its own nation against those of other nations. Because the bourgeoisie sets the interests of its own nation against those of other nations, it inevitably gives rise to mutual suspicion and hostility between nations, and even mutual destruction and oppression. This bourgeois nationalism, when manifested among the Han people, becomes Han chauvinism, and when manifested among minority nationalities, it becomes local nationalism. Neither Han chauvinism nor local nationalism is compatible with socialism or the proletarian view of the nation. The struggle between nationalism and socialism in politics and ideology is part of the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism.

In the eight years since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the vigorous assistance of the Han people, the social landscape of the vast majority of minority areas in China has undergone fundamental changes, economic and cultural construction has seen significant development, and people's lives have improved. It is conceivable that without the leadership of the Communist Party and the help of the Han people, it would have been difficult for the minority nationalities in China to achieve liberation, let alone national prosperity and development. It is hard to imagine that any minority nationality in China can prosper and develop its own nationality and build a great socialist cause without relying on the assistance of the Han and other fraternal nationalities. Although the Han people have a large population and their political, economic, and cultural development is generally more advanced, it would be difficult for them to build China into a great socialist country independently without the support and assistance of the minority nationalities. It is clear that all nationalities in China must unite and help each other in order to achieve common prosperity and development. Unity brings mutual benefit, while division brings mutual harm. Nationalist ideas that are detrimental to national unity and socialist construction must be resolutely criticized.

The Fusion of Nationalities is an Inevitable Trend of Social Development

Some people believe that their nationality will cease to exist in socialist society. This, if not due to misunderstanding, indicates actual disapproval of socialism. Obviously, after the complete victory of socialist transformation, the old things that hinder progress and development of each nationality are overcome, but the nationality and its fine traditions still exist. Not only do they exist, but they also prosper and develop. Of course, as all nationalities jointly build socialism, due to close economic and cultural ties, the common things between them become more and more numerous. But there is nothing to be afraid of in this, and it is precisely an encouraging phenomenon required by the progress and development of all nationalities. If one attempts to isolate one's own nationality, refuses to associate with other nationalities, and refuses to learn from other nationalities, it will be impossible to build socialism or to allow one's own nationality to progress and develop. And if this were the case, it would truly place one's own nationality in a state of decline. A nationality is a historical category in a certain era; it has its origin, development, and end. The end of a nationality, namely the fusion of nationalities, is an inevitable trend of social development. It is fundamentally different from the forced assimilation during the period of reactionary rule and must be strictly distinguished. At the same time, the fusion of nationalities must go through a very long period, and even in a certain period of communist society in the future, there will still be national differences. In the period of building socialism, although there is a tendency towards national fusion, and we should support this trend, the issue is definitely not the demise of nationalities, but how to promote national prosperity and development.

    报刊论文摘要
    资产阶级民族主义和社会主义的斗争是两条道路的斗争
    民族主义是资产阶级思想在民族问题上的反映。从资产阶级民族主义的民族观出发，便会产生资产阶级对于民族问题的纲领和政策。资产阶级对于民族问题的纲领和政策，是从资产阶级狭隘的阶级利益出发的。它在民族内部，要使整个人民的利益服从它一个阶级的利益；对民族之间，要把自己民族的利益同其他民族对立起来。由于资产阶级把自己民族的利益同其他民族对立起来，便必然要产生民族间的互相猜疑和仇视，甚至互相摧残和压迫。这种资产阶级的民族主义，表现在汉族方面，便成为大汉族主义，表现在少数民族方面，便成为地方民族主义。不论大汉族主义或地方民族主义，都是同社会主义、同无产阶级的民族观根本不相容的。在政治上和思想上民族主义与社会主义的斗争，是资本主义和社会主义两条道路斗争的一部分。
    解放以后八年来，我国各少数民族在中国共产党的领导下和汉族人民的大力帮助下，绝大多数的民族地区的社会面貌已经有了根本的变化，经济和文化建设事业有了显著的发展，人民的生活有了改善。可以设想，如果没有共产党的领导和汉族人民的帮助，我国各少数民族便很难得到解放，更谈不到民族的繁荣和发展。很难设想，我国某一个少数民族不依靠汉族和其他兄弟民族的帮助，能够繁荣和发展本民族，建设伟大的社会主义事业。汉族的人口虽然众多，并且政治、经济、文化发展一般也比较先进，但是如果没有少数民族的支援和帮助，也很难独力将我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。由此可见，我国各民族必须团结互助，才能共同繁荣、共同发展。合则两利，分则两害。不利于祖国统一和民族团结、不利于社会主义建设的民族主义思想，必须进行坚决的批判。
      （摘自1957年11月15日中国青年报江山、居方：“反对资产阶级民族主义，巩固和加强我国各民族团结和统一”）
    民族间的溶合是社会发展的必然趋势
    有一些人认为：到了社会主义社会，他们的民族就不会存在了。这如果不是出于误会，就是表明实际上不赞成社会主义。很显然，在社会主义改造彻底胜利之后，各民族旧有的那些阻碍进步和发展的东西是被克服了，但是民族和它的优良传统仍然存在。不仅存在，而且还得到繁荣和发展。当然，各民族在共同建设社会主义事业中，由于经济、文化的密切联系，互相间共同的东西愈来愈增多了。但这丝毫没有什么可怕，而正是各民族发展进步所要求的值得鼓舞的现象。如果企图把自己的民族孤立起来，拒绝和别的民族来往，拒绝向别的民族学习，就无法建设社会主义，也无法使自己的民族得到进步和发展。而如果真是这样，就会真正把自己的民族置于衰亡的境地。民族是一个在一定时代的历史范畴，它有它的发生、发展和终结。民族的终结即民族间的溶合，是社会发展的必然趋势。它和反动统治时期的强迫同化有着原则的不同，必须严格的区别对待。同时民族间的溶合要经过很长的时期，甚至将来到了共产主义社会的一定时期内，还会有民族差别存在。在建设社会主义的时期，虽然有着民族溶合的趋向，并且我们应当赞助这个趋向，但存在的绝不是什么民族消亡问题，而是如何促进民族繁荣和发展的问题。　（摘自1957年“民族团结”第二期杨静仁：“批判地方民族主义”）
