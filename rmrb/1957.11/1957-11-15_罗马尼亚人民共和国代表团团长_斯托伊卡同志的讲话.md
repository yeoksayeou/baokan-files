Comrades! On behalf of the government of the People's Republic of Romania, the Romanian Workers' Party, and all the Romanian people, I extend to you warm, fraternal greetings and sincerely congratulate you on your glorious festival—the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.
(Applause)
It has been forty years since the emergence of the world's first state of workers and peasants. Having freed themselves from capitalist exploitation and united in the great, fraternal multi-ethnic socialist state, the Soviet peoples, in this short period, have ascended to heights in the development of economy, culture, and science and technology that enable them to begin building a communist society through their creative power.
All people around the world who love peace, freedom, progress, and civilization are elated by the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.
The tremendous achievements of the Soviet regime in the economic, cultural, and social spheres over the past forty years eloquently demonstrate the world-historical significance of this revolution, which was accomplished under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, founded and nurtured by the great genius of mankind, Lenin. (Applause)
In these days, the working people of all countries regard the Soviet Union with praise and love. They know that the path opened by the Great October Socialist Revolution is a path that can eliminate human exploitation and establish a free and happy new life.
Hundreds of millions of working people around the world look with boundless trust and well-deserved joy to the leading and inspiring force of the heroic Soviet people—the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The immortal Leninist ideology, which has proven to possess invincible strength, illuminates the path for the working people of the world and empowers them infinitely in their struggles.
During these forty years, the enemies of socialism have exhausted every means to create obstacles in the path of the Soviet Union! Blockades, the intervention of fourteen countries, subversion, the despicable aggression of Hitler—all of this was intended to hinder the victorious advance of the Soviet Union. But all this was in vain. Socialism has not only proven its vitality and invincible strength but has also demonstrated its immense superiority over capitalism.
Now, as forty years ago, the international imperialist bloc is plotting activities against peace and the freedom of peoples. These anti-people plans have not fundamentally changed, but the situation in the world has undergone fundamental changes. Socialism has transcended the boundaries of one country. It has become a world system, which is the greatest victorious achievement of the peoples of all countries.
In our era, hundreds of millions of people in colonies and dependent countries are shattering the shackles of imperialist enslavement and, together with the socialist countries, forming a vast zone of peace. The vigorous development of the socialist countries and the trend towards the disintegration of the colonial system are unstoppable.
Today, approximately one billion people worldwide are advancing on the path opened up by October 1917. The unbreakable unity of socialist countries and the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, the unbreakable unity of the communist and workers' movements, is a guarantee of the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries and a decisive factor in defending world peace.
Comrades! The Romanian people, as a member of the great socialist family, are happy and proud of this. The workers and peasants of Romania celebrate the Great October Socialist Revolution with the greatest enthusiasm. The great example of the October Socialist Revolution inspired the strikers and marchers against the bourgeoisie and landlords in 1917–1920, the soldiers of the Romanian Revolutionary Camp in Odessa, the sailors of the 1918 uprising, and the Romanian peasants who demanded land to till.
In the flames of these revolutionary battles, our working class established its vanguard—the Romanian Communist Party, the Leninist Party, which inscribed on its battle flag the determination to advance resolutely along the path of the Great October Revolution. (Applause)
Today, Romania is a socialist country where workers and peasants hold power, and under the leadership of the Party, they are building a socialist society and realizing the great task of rejuvenating the country. The achievements our country has made in socialist construction once again confirm the correctness of the Leninist path and prove that only by advancing along this path can our working people achieve the complete victory of socialism.
At every stage of building the socialist economy and culture, our people have enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, the fruits of friendly mutual assistance from the socialist camp countries and have received the internationalist help and support of the Soviet state. (Applause)
Our Party considers the treasure trove of experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to be an invaluable asset, and the basic elements of this experience are of world-historical significance. The rock-solid unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its uncompromising attitude towards all attempts to undermine this unity are our best example.
The idea of proletarian internationalism is the foundation of the unbreakable unity of the socialist countries and the foundation of the strength of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. This idea is also the foundation of the ideological unity and fraternal friendship of all communist and workers' parties around the world. This fraternal friendship has withstood all tests in the storms of recent decades, and the fact that representatives of brother parties from all over the world are gathered here today is a vivid manifestation of this fraternal friendship. (Applause)
Dear Comrades! Like the Soviet Union and all other fraternal socialist countries, and like all other peace-loving countries that are fighting for the cause of peace and are constantly strengthening the forces of peace, the People's Republic of Romania will continue to be fully determined to do everything possible to strengthen the struggle to ensure the victory of the idea of peaceful coexistence and the idea of cooperation among the peoples of all countries. (Applause)
The Romanian people view with joy and elation the outstanding victories achieved by the fraternal Soviet people in all fields. On this great festival of all toilers, our people warmly and sincerely wish the Soviet government, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and all the Soviet people ever-increasing achievements as they advance along the path of the Great October Revolution and the brilliant path of communism.
(Applause)
Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by the Central Committee! (Applause)
Long live the great fraternal unity of the working people of all countries! Long live the unbreakable unity of the communist and workers' parties of all countries under the banner of Marxism-Leninism!
Long live peace among the peoples of all countries around the world! (Prolonged applause)

    罗马尼亚人民共和国代表团团长
    斯托伊卡同志的讲话
    亲爱的同志们！我谨代表罗马尼亚人民共和国政府、罗马尼亚工人党和罗马尼亚全体人民向你们致以热烈的、兄弟的敬礼，并且衷心地祝贺你们光荣的节日——伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。
    （掌声）
    自从世界上产生第一个工农国家以来已经过了四十年。摆脱了资本主义剥削并且团结在伟大的、兄弟般的多民族社会主义国家中的苏联各族人民，在这个短短的时期中以他们的创造力量在经济、文化和科学技术的发展方面已攀登上了能够开始建设共产主义社会的高峰。
    全世界一切热爱和平、自由、进步和文明的人们都为苏联人民在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候所达到的光辉成就感到欢欣鼓舞。
    苏维埃政权四十年来在经济、文化和社会各方面所获得的巨大成就雄辩地证明了，在人类伟大的天才列宁所创建和教养出来的光荣的共产党的领导下所完成的这一革命的世界历史性的意义。（掌声）
    世界各国的劳动人民这几天都对苏联怀着称颂和爱戴的心情。他们知道，伟大的十月社会主义革命所开辟的道路是一条能够消灭人剥削人和建立自由幸福的新生活的道路。
    全世界亿万劳动人民都怀着无限信任和理所当然的喜悦的心情来看英勇的苏联人民的领导力量和鼓舞力量——光荣的苏联共产党。事实证明具有不可战胜的力量的、不朽的列宁主义思想，给全世界劳动人民照亮了道路，使他们在斗争中获得了无穷的力量。
    在这四十年中，社会主义的敌人想尽办法在苏联的道路上制造种种的障碍！封锁，十四国的干涉，颠覆，卑鄙的希特勒的侵略，——所有这一切都是为了要阻挡苏联的胜利前进。但是这一切都是徒劳。社会主义不仅证明了它的生命力和不可战胜的力量，而且显示了它对资本主义的巨大优越性。
    国际帝国主义集团现在同四十年前一样，在策划反对和平和人民
  自由的活动。这些仇视人民的计划基本上没有改变，可是世界的情况却起了根本的变化。社会主义已经越出了一个国家的范围。它已经成为一个世界体系，这是各国人民最伟大的胜利成果。
    在我们的时代里，殖民地和附属国的亿万人民正在打碎帝国主义奴役的枷锁，同社会主义国家一道形成了广大的和平区域。社会主义国家的蓬勃发展和殖民体系瓦解的趋势是无法制止的。
    现在全世界约有十亿人民正在1917年十月所开辟的道路上前进。社会主义各国和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的牢不可破的团结，共产主义运动和工人运动的牢不可破的团结，这是各国人民自由和独立的保证，是保卫世界和平的决定性因素。
    同志们！罗马尼亚人民作为伟大的社会主义大家庭中的一员，这是他们感到幸福并引以自豪的。罗马尼亚的工人和农民怀着最大的热情庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命，十月社会主义革命的伟大榜样鼓舞了1917年至1920年反对资产阶级和地主的罢工者和游行者，鼓舞了敖德萨罗马尼亚革命营的战士、1918年起义的水兵们，也鼓舞了要求耕者有其田的罗马尼亚农民。
    我国工人阶级在这些革命战斗的烈火中建立了自己的先锋队——罗马尼亚共产党、列宁主义的党，这个党在自己的战斗旗帜上写着要坚决地沿着伟大十月革命的道路前进。（掌声）
    现在，罗马尼亚是一个工农掌握政权的社会主义国家，工人和农民在党的领导下建设社会主义社会，实现复兴国家的伟大任务。我国在社会主义建设中取得的成就，再一次证实了列宁道路的正确性，证明我国劳动人民只有沿着这条道路前进才能取得社会主义的完全胜利。
    我国人民在建设社会主义经济和文化的各个阶段上，过去和现在都享受到社会主义阵营各国友好互助的果实，得到了苏维埃国家的国际主义帮助和支持。（掌声）
    我们党认为苏联共产党的经验宝库是无法估价的财富，这些经验的基本因素都具有全世界历史性的意义。苏联共产党坚如磐石般的团结一致以及它对一切破坏这种团结的企图所采取的不调和态度，是我们的最好榜样。
    无产阶级国际主义的思想是社会主义各国牢不可破的团结一致的基础，是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量的基础。这种思想也是全世界共产党和工人党的思想团结和兄弟友爱的基础，这种兄弟友爱在最近几十年的风暴中经受了一切考验，从世界各地来的各兄弟党的代表今天在这里相聚一堂，也是这种兄弟友爱的生动表现。（掌声）
    亲爱的同志们！罗马尼亚人民共和国同苏联和其他一切兄弟社会主义国家一样，同正在为和平事业而斗争、正在不断增强和平力量的其他一切爱好和平的国家一样，今后也将充满决心尽一切力量来加强斗争，争取和平共处的思想和各国人民合作的思想得到胜利。（掌声）
    罗马尼亚人民怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情来看待兄弟苏联人民在各方面所获得的卓越胜利。在这全人类劳动者的伟大节日里，我国人民热烈地、衷心地祝苏联政府、苏联共产党和全体苏联人民在沿着伟大十月革命的道路、沿着光辉的共产主义道路前进时取得日新月异的成就。
  （掌声）
    以中央委员会为首的苏联共产党万岁！（掌声）
    各国劳动人民兄弟大团结万岁！马克思列宁主义旗帜下的各国共产党和工人党的牢不可破的团结万岁！
    全世界各国人民之间的和平万岁！（经久不息的掌声）
