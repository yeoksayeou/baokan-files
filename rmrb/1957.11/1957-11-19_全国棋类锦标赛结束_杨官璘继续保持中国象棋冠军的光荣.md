    National Chess Championships Conclude
    Yang Guanlin Continues to Maintain the Glory of Chinese Chess Champion
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th - The second stage of the 1957 National Chess Championships (finals) concluded on the evening of the 17th. Last year's Chinese Chess champion, Yang Guanlin from Guangzhou, maintained his only undefeated record with seven wins, nine draws, and twenty-three points, successfully defending his Chinese Chess championship title.
    The second to sixth place finishers in Chinese Chess all had twenty points.
    Based on the head-to-head results, the amount of time used in their games, the organizing committee ranked the players as follows:
    Wang Jialang (Harbin)　Liu Yici (Hangzhou)
    Song Xiang (Changshu)　Ren Decun (Shenyang)
    Xu Tianli (Shanghai)
    Li Yiting, the Chinese Chess champion of the Wuhan competition zone in the first stage preliminary round and last year's fourth-place finisher, only scored seventeen points, ranking ninth.
    The champions and runners-up in International Chess were Zhang Fujiang from Dalian and You Guozhong from Shanghai. They not only had the same number of points, but their head-to-head match was also a draw. Because Zhang Fujiang used six minutes and twenty-six seconds less time in the competition, he was awarded the championship.
    The third place in International Chess went to Jiang Boxian from Tianjin.
    The Go masters known as "Guo in the North, Liu in the South," Guo Tisheng from Beijing and Liu Dihuai from Shanghai, won first and third place in Go, respectively. The second place went to Chen Jiamou from Nanjing.
