Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The State Council, on the 1st, approved and transmitted the report from the Ministry of Urban Services "Concerning the Issue of Developing Winemaking with Substitutes."

The State Council's instructions said: In a situation of tight grain supply, it is necessary to develop winemaking with substitutes in order to conserve grain, increase social wealth, and appropriately satisfy people's drinking needs. Currently, various regions have begun to pay attention to utilizing winemaking substitutes in areas with concentrated production and convenient transportation; however, they have not paid attention to utilizing winemaking substitutes in areas with scattered production and inconvenient transportation. This situation should be changed. To this end, People's Committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, comprehensively plan, and urge relevant departments to implement and enforce the plan; at the same time, they must prevent the occurrence of shoddy production, substandard products, reduced quality, and harm to health. Relevant central departments should also vigorously support this effort in all aspects, and promptly pay attention to summarizing and promoting experiences in this area.

In its report to the State Council, the Ministry of Urban Services stated that the winemaking substitutes available in various regions of China are very rich, and many of them have high yields and high alcohol production rates, such as acorns, discarded fruits, bagasse, molasses (sugar brine), sugar foam, bran cakes, and sweet potato seedlings. It is estimated that if half of the above seven substitutes could be used for winemaking, it could produce 900,000 tons of wine per year, which is roughly equivalent to the national wine production in 1957.

In order to vigorously develop winemaking with substitutes, the report recommends that the People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government formulate a long-term plan for developing winemaking with substitutes based on the principles of "widespread investigation, extensive experimentation, focusing on key points, and establishing bases," and urge and inspect the relevant departments to implement it.

The report stated that the development of winemaking with substitutes should fully utilize the potential of existing winemaking industrial equipment. If there are regions with abundant raw materials and development prospects that cannot be reasonably utilized by existing industries, simple small-scale wineries or alcohol factories can be built locally under the leadership of the local Party and government, based on the situation and in accordance with the principles of low investment and high returns, using local materials. Although some mountainous areas have many raw materials such as discarded fruits, because the regions are scattered and the brewing time is concentrated within one or two months, it is inconvenient for the state to set up factories. We can also actively help agricultural cooperatives use discarded fruits to brew wine locally. As for the fruit peels and pomace remaining from fruit canning factories, the report suggests that the industrial sector attach winemaking workshops to utilize them.

The report also calls on the industrial, health, agricultural, forestry, supply and marketing cooperatives and other departments to provide strong assistance in resource cultivation, procurement, processing, testing, and identification.

### 节约粮食增加社会财富　适当满足人民饮酒需要  国务院要求各地利用代用品酿酒

    节约粮食增加社会财富　适当满足人民饮酒需要
    国务院要求各地利用代用品酿酒
    新华社2日讯　国务院在1日批转城市服务部“关于发展代用品酿酒问题的报告”。
    国务院的批示说：在粮食供应紧张的情况下，发展代用品酿酒，以节约粮食，增加社会财富，适当地满足人民饮酒的需要，这是必要的。目前，各地对那些生产集中、交通便利地区的酿酒代用品，已经开始注意利用；但是，对那些生产分散、交通不便地区的酿酒代用品，还没有注意利用。这种状况，应该加以改变。为此，各级人民委员会对于发展代用品酿酒要加强领导，全面规划，并且督促有关部门贯彻执行；同时，要防止粗制滥造、不合规格、降低质量、有损健康的现象发生。中央各有关部门，也应该从各方面大力予以支持，及时注意总结和推广这方面的经验。
    城市服务部在给国务院的报告中说，我国各地可以利用的酿酒代用品是很丰富的，其中有不少产量大、出酒率高的品种，如橡子、废弃果、蔗渣、糖蜜（糖卤水）、糖泡、糠饼、红薯茆等。据估算，以上七种代用品如能利用一半来酿酒，一年即可产酒九十万吨，大约相当于1957年全国酒的产量。
    为了大力发展代用品酿酒，报告建议各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会根据“普遍调查，多做试验，抓住重点，建立基地”的原则，制定一个较长期的发展代用品酿酒的规划，并且督促与检查有关部门贯彻执行。
    报告中说，发展代用品酿酒，应当充分利用现有酿酒工业设备的潜力。如果原料多、有发展前途而在现有工业不能合理地利用的地区，可以在当地党、政的领导下，根据情况，由工业部门、供销社或者服务部门按照投资少、收效大的原则，就地取材，建设简易的小型酒厂或酒精厂。有些山区虽然废弃果等原料很多，但是因为地区分散，酿造时间又集中在一两个月以内，国家设厂不便，还可以积极帮助农业社利用废弃果就地酿酒。至于水果罐头厂剩余的果皮、果渣，报告建议工业部门附设酿酒车间加以利用。
    报告中还要求工业、卫生、农业、林业、供销合作社等部门，在资源培植、采购、加工、化验、鉴定等方面，予以大力协助。
