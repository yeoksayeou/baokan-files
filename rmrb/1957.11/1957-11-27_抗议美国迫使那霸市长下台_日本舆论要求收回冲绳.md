    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - Tokyo news: The Japanese press has unanimously and strongly protested against the US military authorities in Okinawa for using barbaric means to illegally force the Mayor of Naha City, Kamejiro Senaga, to step down.
    The "Akahata" published an editorial today denouncing that the actions of the US military authorities in Okinawa are barbaric and fascist, and reminiscent of the Japanese militarist Hideki Tojo during the Second World War. The editorial pointed out that the reason why the US imperialists are adopting such infuriating and barbaric means is to try to prevent the wavering and unease of its allies, which began with the launch of the Soviet artificial satellite and the success of intercontinental missiles, by strengthening the imperialist military system and strengthening the military bases of important strategic strongholds.
    "Mainichi Shimbun," one of Japan's three major bourgeois newspapers, said that the United States' activities in Okinawa to undermine democratic principles will result in unhappiness between Japan and the United States. "Yomiuri Shimbun" and "Asahi Shimbun" unanimously demanded in their commentaries today that the United States return Okinawa to Japan. They said that this is the only way to fundamentally solve the problem.

    抗议美国迫使那霸市长下台
    日本舆论要求收回冲绳
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本报界一致强烈抗议冲绳岛美军当局采用横暴的手段，非法迫使那霸市长濑长龟次郎下台。
    “赤旗报”今天发表社论指责说，冲绳岛美军当局的做法是横暴的法西斯的手段，并且使人想起了第二次世界大战时期的日本军国主义者东条英机。社论指出，美帝国主义者所以采用这样令人愤怒的横暴手段，是企图以加强帝国主义军事体制和加强重要战略据点的军事基地的方法来阻止由于苏联人造卫星的发射和洲际导弹的成功而开始的它的同盟国的动摇和不安。
    日本资产阶级的三大报纸之一“每日新闻”说，美国在冲绳的破坏民主原则的活动，结果会造成日美两国间的不幸。“读卖新闻”和“朝日新闻”今天在评论中一致要美国把冲绳岛归还日本。它们说，只有这样才能从根本上解决问题。
