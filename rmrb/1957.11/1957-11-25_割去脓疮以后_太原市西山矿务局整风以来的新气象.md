After Draining the Abscess
—New Atmosphere in the Rectification Campaign of the Xishan Mining Bureau in Taiyuan City

By our reporter Gu Ye

Jia Juxu was the first to arrive! It was almost time for work, and the workers were striding towards the mine. “Has Jia Juxu arrived?” “Haven't seen him yet.” Many people slowed down when they heard Jia Juxu hadn't arrived. Jia Juxu was a blaster. Every day, people entering the pit had to wait for him to slowly drill holes and set off explosives to blast the coal before busily hauling and transporting it. Because he was often the last to arrive at work, everyone would sit around doing nothing for more than an hour each day. Today, everyone had hoped to produce a few more carts of coal, but they felt discouraged when they heard that Jia Juxu hadn't arrived.

As people approached the coal face, they heard an explosion, followed by a familiar accent: "Who's last place today?"

Who was the first to arrive?

"Jia Juxu!"

"Everyone said they'd have bad luck following you today; didn't expect you'd arrive first!" The workers were both surprised and delighted.

"I've prepared everything; it's all up to you now."

Everyone saw that the coal had indeed been blasted all over the ground.

From that day on, Jia Juxu went from being the most despised person to the most popular. In the past, everyone disliked him for being lazy and didn't want him around. Now, people said Jia Juxu was really capable, and with him, increasing production by dozens of tons of coal every day was no problem.

In recent months, fresh events like Jia Juxu's transformation have continuously appeared in the mining area of the Xishan Mining Bureau in Taiyuan City, and the face of the mine has been completely renewed.

	Where Did the Evil Wind Blow From?

The Xishan Mining Bureau was changed from a local state-owned enterprise to a state-owned enterprise on New Year's Day 1956. In 1956, due to the leadership's lack of thorough work and chaotic management and relaxed labor discipline, the annual coal production was only 1.86 million tons, 193,000 tons less than the state plan, and 1.5% lower than the actual output in 1955. Costs also exceeded the budget by 1.76 million yuan. This year, the state required the production of 2 million tons of coal, and the workers felt it would be difficult to complete.

To reverse the backward situation, the leaders of the Mining Bureau conducted a concentrated socialist ideological education among the workers in the spring of this year. The situation improved somewhat, but not fundamentally.

For example, the Songshukeng transport team had an attendance rate of only 50%-70% last year, and it didn't improve to 80% in the first half of this year. Among the more than seventy workers in the team, there were still a dozen long-term "sick" workers. From January to July, this team had forty-four accidents, resulting in a loss of more than 1,200 tons of raw coal. On June 6, Li Yanyuan, who was in charge of switching cars, was sound asleep in the safety tunnel. A train of unattended coal cars crashed into the switch, breaking the steel cable of the coal cars and interrupting the transport work for five hours. The team held a meeting to criticize Li Yanyuan. Liu Wanxi stood up and said, "In the past, two people were responsible here. The leadership casually reduced one person, so of course, there will be problems." Lei Xiaoxiao retorted, "Now the task of transporting coal is less than before. One person is enough. Besides, reducing it to one person should make the work even more intense. Why are you sleeping?" Liu Wanxi said, "Okay! The merit is the team leader's, and the problems are the masses'.” The meeting broke up in disorder.

In the Xishan Mining Bureau, such chaotic production teams as the Songshukeng transport team were not isolated cases. There was an evil atmosphere in the mine: some people were often late or left early, some pretended to be sick when they weren't, some were absent from work for no reason, some stole and gambled, some occupied dormitories, some demanded wage treatment, and some just loved to make trouble for no reason...

These situations posed a question to the leadership: who exactly were these people who violated labor discipline? Why couldn't education solve the problem?

In the rapid development of the Xishan Mining Bureau in recent years, it has become an enterprise with a large number of new workers. According to investigations and understanding: among the more than 11,000 workers in the bureau, less than 10% were old workers before liberation, and about 60% of the total number of workers came to the mine after 1954, including more than one hundred bad elements. Some new workers from peasants, students, and urban poor retained a strong petty-bourgeois ideological style. Some bad elements took advantage of this weakness, encouraging them to pretend to be sick and make trouble, causing many losses to the mine. The dozen long-term "sick" workers in the Songshukeng transport team were instigated by Liu Wanxi, who had been a school officer in Yan Xishan's bandit army for twenty years. Li Yanyuan's sleeping on June 6 was also secretly instigated by Liu Wanxi.

Through the analysis of this typical fact, the leading comrades of the party committees at all levels of the Mining Bureau realized that ideological education only worked for those workers with low awareness, but it was useless for bad elements like Liu Wanxi. It was necessary to mobilize the broad masses of workers to thoroughly expose the true faces of various bad elements to effectively educate new workers, fundamentally eliminate the evil atmosphere, and renew the mine's production outlook.

	Pulling Out the Bad Roots

In August, as soon as the rectification movement began, the miners rose up to expose the anti-socialist words and deeds of the bad elements. Lei Xiaoxiao, a worker in the Songshukeng transport team, handed over a notebook recording Liu Wanxi's sabotage activities to the leading comrades. He said excitedly: "This records all the facts of how Liu Wanxi messed up our team. I reported it countless times in the past, but the leadership blamed us for not being able to unite the masses. Now everyone is asking to investigate this person. He is a bad root!"

The workers exposed more than one hundred various bad elements. The bad element Yue Shutang often beat doctors, forcing them to approve his "sick" leave. Last year, he only worked for thirty-seven days, and only seven days this year. Together with Bai Zuowu, a landlord element who had infiltrated the mine, he formed a group of more than thirty people to file complaints and incite trouble more than twenty times. Song Jinyu, who had served as a puppet soldier, colluded with Qiu Baoli, a doctor who had also served as a puppet military doctor, asking him to approve "sick" leave for thirty-four people and fraudulently obtain sick leave wages. According to statistics, since last year, these people have fraudulently obtained more than 10,000 yuan in wage subsidies by pretending to be sick, resulting in a loss of more than 17,000 tons of raw coal.

After these more than one hundred bad elements infiltrated the mine, they had formed various reactionary organizations because they had not been discovered for a long time, secretly cursing the Communist Party and the new society, and carrying out various sabotage activities.

These shocking facts educated the broad masses of employees. Some people said: "What will the mine become if these bad guys are allowed to continue?" Some said: "I thought that after Chiang Kai-shek's millions of troops were defeated, a few counter-revolutionary elements could be drowned by everyone spitting on them. Who knew that there were still such bad elements stirring up trouble and sabotaging production in the mine?"

People were in high spirits and discussed intensely. In order to further raise the awareness of the broad masses of workers, the Party Committee of the Mining Bureau immediately organized an unprecedented debate. More than 9,000 workers, with old workers as the core, gathered in various meetings to question the bad elements: why do you want to carry out sabotage in the mine, why do you want to curse the new society?

"Because the new society is not as good as the old society." The bad element Lü Jianguo dared to answer like this at one meeting. People angrily asked him: "How is the new society not good? How is the old society good?" Lü Jianguo said: "In the old society, money could buy things. In the new society, you have to queue up to buy grain, and even if you queue up, what you buy is not enough to eat. Is forty-eight catties of grain a month enough for me to eat?" The old worker Gong Zirong stood up and said: "You worked in Yan Xishan's hook army for more than ten years, and you could rob and plunder at will. Others suffered, and you lived comfortably. Now, of course, you think the new society is not good. All the good things in the mine have become bad in your eyes. In the old society, we wore cement bags and worked all day long, eating bean cakes and bran vegetables without even filling our stomachs. We couldn't even afford those forty-eight catties of rice and white flour if we wanted to queue up to buy them. Now, who doesn't eat white flour and rice, who doesn't see a doctor when they are sick?" Liu Zhonghai said: "In the past, when you were sick, you could only go to Gaojiahe to register your household, asking the wolf doctor. In those years, every day, workers who were half-dead from hunger and disease were dragged to Gaojiahe to be eaten by wolves and dogs. How beautiful the lives of workers and peasants are now, and we will never allow you to do bad things in the mine!"

In those tense days, everyone was considering and answering such questions: which society is better? Which society do you love? Jia Juxu was also thinking about this question. He thought: When I was ten years old, my dad crawled out of a small coal mine and got a dime a day, asking me to queue up to buy grain. I stood in the snow for half a day and only bought a little red grain, which was only enough for one meal. Now, my dad works in the woodworking cooperative, and I work in the mine. Our family's monthly income is more than 400 yuan. We haven't had a day where we only have one meal. Now, everyone has grain to eat and money to spend, and there's nothing wrong with queuing up to buy tickets to see movies. The new society has given me so many benefits that I can't finish listing them. Thinking of this, he discovered the ugly things in his thoughts. After coming to the mine, his income increased, and he became complacent, disliking this job being hard and that job being dirty. He would take leave after working for a few days, and he would be listless as soon as he entered the pit, always being last place. He thought: I've caused so much loss to the country by doing this! Only the bad elements are happy to see me fooling around like this; they want to overthrow the Communist Party and make us suffer again. I must never do this again in the future!

Many workers with low awareness improved their awareness after this sharp ideological struggle. At the reasoning and debate meeting, Wei Dianqing, who had been deceived by Liu Wanxi for a long time, said to Liu Wanxi: "You took advantage of my shortcomings of being greedy for enjoyment and disregarding national interests, preventing us from completing the state plan. When everyone exposes your bad deeds, you go to the family dormitories to threaten, saying, 'See how long you can be arrogant?' What is your intention?"

The bad elements saw that they were completely isolated and had to lower their heads and confess their crimes.

In order to purify the working class ranks, the Party Committee of the Mining Bureau is dealing with the exposed bad elements separately. Some will be expelled, some will have their worker status removed and be subject to production control, and some will be subject to labor re-education. Yue Shutang, Song Jinyu, and others have been arrested according to law for causing great losses to the mine.

	Only the People Have Changed!

In late October, when the rectification movement of the Mining Bureau entered the stage of focusing on rectification, I came to the mining area. In the rolling mountains, the mine cars full of raw coal appeared from time to time. Zhao Qing, the secretary of the Party Committee of the Mining Bureau, said to me:

"The amount of coking coal transported out of here every day is increasing. Last year, the average daily production was only about 5,000 tons. In the first half of this year, the average daily production was more than 5,000 tons. It gradually increased from the end of July, and it has been maintained at more than 8,000 tons since September. Among the three mines in the bureau, Du'erping has completed the annual plan ahead of schedule. It is expected that by the end of the year, it can reach the production level of 2.45 million tons stipulated in the first five-year plan."

"Has the production conditions changed?" I asked.

"No. The cadres and workers are the same old people, using the same machines. Some production conditions are even worse than last year."

What is the reason for this? Comrade Zhao Qing said that it is because the people have changed! After the bad elements were exposed, there were no more phenomena of unwarranted absenteeism, pretending to be sick, stealing, gambling, or making trouble for no reason. The attendance rate has reached more than 90%. People who used to "eat labor insurance" have automatically made self-criticisms. In the minds of the workers, pretending to be sick and being absent from work to "eat labor insurance" has become shameful. In the past, there were more than 100 people lining up to see a doctor at the Du'erping Mine's clinic every day, but now there are only about 20 people. Nurse Zhang Yun said: "The rectification movement is really good, and there are fewer patients." The workers' organization and discipline have been greatly strengthened. Grassroots cadres and some technicians said: "In the past, we wore out our mouths and ran our legs off, but many workers still wouldn't listen to commands; now it's really good, everyone works seriously and is very active and motivated." The cooks in the public canteen also said: "Now the workers automatically line up to eat, without arguing or making noise; we never see things like smashing plates and bowls or beating and scolding people anymore." There are no more excessive demands on welfare issues. Some people who occupied dormitories have automatically given up the unreasonably occupied houses. Some people who took public furniture at random have also automatically gone to the general affairs section to write supplementary IOUs, and some have returned the extra stoves, stovepipes, kettles, bed boards, etc. Therefore, the staff in charge of general affairs and welfare said: "Now things are much easier to handle."

    割去脓疮以后
    ——太原市西山矿务局整风以来的新气象
    本报记者　顾页
    贾巨旭第一个来了！快上班了，工人们都迈着大步向矿坑走去。“贾巨旭来了没有？”“还没见他的影儿呢。”许多人听说贾巨旭没来，步子也迈小了。贾巨旭是个放炮工。每天人们进坑，总要等他慢条斯理地打眼放炮，炸下煤来，才忙着攉的攉，运的运。因为他经常最后一个上班，所以每天大家便有一个多小时坐着没事干。今天大家原想多出几车煤的，听说贾巨旭没来就泄气了。
    人们走近采煤工作面的时候，听到了爆炸声，接着又听到一个熟悉的口音：“今天是谁倒数第一呀？”
    是谁先来了呢？
    “贾巨旭！”
    “都说今天跟着你倒霉呢，没想到你已经先来啦！”工人们又惊又喜。
    “我一切都准备好了，只看你们的了。”
    大家一看，果然煤已给崩了一地。
    从这天起，贾巨旭由一个最臭的人变成了最香的人。以往，谁都嫌他懒，不要他，现在人们都说贾巨旭真行，有了他，每天增产几十吨煤炭没问题。
    近几个月来，像贾巨旭转变一样的新鲜事，不断地出现在太原市西山矿务局的矿区里，矿山的面貌为之焕然一新。
        邪风从哪里吹来？
    西山矿务局是1956年元旦由地方国营改为国营的。1956年由于领导工作不深入，管理混乱，劳动纪律松弛，全年只出煤一百八十六万吨，比国家计划少十九万三千吨，比1955年实际产量低1．5％，成本也超支一百七十六万元。今年国家要求生产二百万吨煤，职工们认为难以完成。
    为了扭转落后局面，今年春天，矿务局的领导曾在工人群众中集中地进行了一次社会主义思想教育。情况有些好转，但没有根本好转。
    例如松树坑的搬运组，去年出勤率只有50％—70％，今年上半年也没提高到80％。全组七十多名工人中，仍然有十几个长期“病号”。1至7月，这个组出了四十四次事故，少产原煤一千二百余吨。6月6日那天，管转车的李眼元在安全洞里睡大觉，一趟无人管理的煤车冲撞到转车上，拉断了带煤车的钢丝绳，使搬运工作中断五小时。小组开会批评李眼元。刘万喜却站出来说：“从前在那里是两个人负责，领导上随便减少了一个人，当然要出问题。”雷肖小反驳道：“现在运煤任务比从前少，一个人管就够了。再说减为一个人，工作就应当更紧张些，为什么还去睡觉？”刘万喜说：“好！有功是组长的，出了问题都是群众的。”会议一哄而散。
    在西山矿务局，像松树坑搬运组这样混乱的生产小组，还不是个别的。矿山里有一股邪气：有的人经常迟到早退，有的人没病装病，有的人无故旷工，有的人偷盗赌博，有的人抢占宿舍，有的人闹工资待遇，有的人专爱无理取闹……。
    这些情况，向领导提出了一个问题：这些违犯劳动纪律的人，到底是一些什么人呢？为什么教育也不能解决问题？
    西山矿务局在近几年的迅速发展中，已成为一个拥有大量新工人的企业。据调查了解：全局一万一千多工人中，解放前的老工人不到10％，1954年以后来矿山的新工人约占工人总数的60％，其中还有一百多坏分子。有一部分出身于农民、学生、城市贫民的新工人，保留着浓厚的小资产阶级的思想作风。一些坏分子就利用这个弱点，怂恿他们装病闹事，给矿山造成许多损失。松树坑搬运组的十几个长期“病号”，就是曾在阎锡山匪部干过二十年校官的刘万喜唆使出来的。6月6日李眼元睡大觉，也是刘万喜暗地教唆的。
    通过对这个典型事实的分析，矿务局各级党委领导同志们才认识到：思想教育对那些觉悟不高的工人才起作用，而对刘万喜那种坏分子是没有用的，必须发动广大工人群众彻底揭露各种坏分子的真面目，才能有效地教育新工人，才能从根本上铲除邪气，使矿山的生产面貌一新。
              拔掉坏根儿
    8月里，整风运动一开始，矿工们便纷纷起来揭发坏分子的反社会主义言行。松树坑搬运组工人雷肖小把记载着刘万喜进行破坏活动的笔记本交给领导同志。他激动地说：“这里面记的都是刘万喜把我们小组闹得一团糟的种种事实。从前我反映过无数次，可是领导上却怪我们不会团结群众。现在大家要求查清这个人。他是个坏根儿！”
    工人们揭露了一百多名各种坏分子。坏分子岳树堂经常殴打医生，逼着医生批准他“病”假。去年一年，他只干了三十七天活，今年只上了七天班。他同混进矿山的地主分子白作武一起，合伙拉拢三十多个人组成一个告状集团，煽动闹事达二十多次。当过伪军的宋金玉拉拢曾当过伪军医的医生丘保礼，要他给三十四个人批
  “病”假，骗取病假工资。据统计，去年以来，这些人装病骗取的工资补助费达一万余元，造成了少产原煤一万七千多吨的损失。
    这一百多名坏分子混进矿山后，由于长期未被发觉，已经形成了各种反动组织，暗地里咒骂共产党和新社会，并进行各种破坏活动。
    这些触目惊心的事实，教育了广大的职工群众。有的人说：
      “要是再让这些坏家伙干下去，矿山会变成什么样子？”有的说：“我原想蒋介石那几百万军队被打垮了，有几个反革命分子，一人吐他一口唾沫，也淹死他们了。哪知矿山里还有这样的坏分子在兴风作浪破坏生产？”
    人们情绪激昂，议论纷纷。矿务局党委会为了进一步提高广大工人群众的觉悟，立即组织了一次空前规模的辩论会。以老工人为核心的九千多名工人，在各种会议上群起责问坏分子：为什么要在矿山进行破坏，为什么要咒骂新社会？
    “因为新社会就是不如旧社会好。”坏分子吕建国在一次会上竟敢这样回答。人们愤怒地问他：“新社会怎么不好？旧社会怎么好？”吕建国说：“在旧社会有钱能买东西，在新社会买粮都要排队，排了队买的还不够吃。我一个月四十八斤粮食难道够吃吗？”老工人巩子荣站出来说：“你在阎锡山的勾子军里干过十几年，可以乱抢乱夺，别人受罪，你过舒服日子，现在，当然嫌新社会不好。矿山里的好事，在你的眼里都成了坏的了。我们在旧社会里穿洋灰袋纸，一天到晚干活，吃豆饼糠菜还填不饱肚皮，想排队还没钱买那四十八斤大米白面。如今谁不吃白面大米，谁病了不请医生？”刘忠海说：“从前病了只能到高家河去报户口，请狼医生。那些年月，哪一天没有被饥饿瘟疫拖得半死的工人被拖到高家河遭狼拉狗啃。现在工人农民的生活有多美满，我们绝不容许你在矿山干坏事！”
    在那些紧张的日子里，每个人都在考虑和答复这样的问题：究竟哪个社会好？你爱哪个社会？贾巨旭也在想这个问题。他想：我十来岁那年，爹从小煤窑里爬出来，一天领得一角钱，叫我去排队买粮，在雪地里站了半天，才买得一点红粮，只够吃一餐。现在爹在木作业社工作，我在矿山，一家每月收入四百多元，再没过过一天才有一顿吃的日子。现在，人人都有粮食吃，有钱花，排队买票看电影，有什么不好呢？新社会给我的好处说不完。想到这里，他发现了自己思想里的丑恶的东西。来矿山以后，他的收入多了，从此便心满意足，嫌这活苦，那活不干净，干些日子又请假，一进坑就没劲，干活倒数第一。他心里想：我这样作，给国家造成了好大的损失啊！这样胡闹，只有坏分子看了高兴；他们就想推翻共产党，让我们再受罪。往后，可万万不能这样了！
    许多觉悟不高的工人，经过这场尖锐的思想斗争以后，觉悟都提高了。在说理辩论会上，长期受刘万喜蒙蔽的尉殿卿，冲着刘万喜说：“你利用我贪图享受不顾国家利益的缺点，不让我们完成国家计划。大家揭发你干坏事，你就到家属宿舍恐吓说：‘看你们还能横行几天？’你这是什么用意？”
    坏分子看见自己陷于完全的孤立，不得不低头认罪。
    为了纯洁工人阶级队伍，矿务局党委会对揭露出来的各种坏分子，正在分别地加以处理，有的将予以开除，有的摘掉工人帽子管制生产，有的劳动教养。岳树堂、宋金玉等人由于给矿山造成很大损失，已依法逮捕。
          只是人变了！
    10月下旬，矿务局的整风运动进入着重整改阶段的时候，我来到了矿区。在起伏的山峦中，不时出现那满载原煤的矿车。矿务局党委书记赵清对我说：
    “每天从这里运出去的炼焦用煤，越来越多了。去年每天平均只生产五千吨左右，今年前半年平均日产五千多吨，从7月下旬起逐渐上升，9月以来一直保持在八千吨以上。在全局的三个矿中，杜儿坪已经提前完成了年计划。预计到年底，可以达到第一个五年计划规定的二百四十五万吨的生产水平。”
      “生产条件有改变吗？”我问。
    “没有。干部、工人是原班人马，用的还是那些机器，有些生产条件还不如去年呢。”
    这是什么原因？赵清同志说，是人变了！坏分子被揭发以后，无故旷工、没病装病、偷盗赌博，无理取闹的现象没有了。出勤率已经达到90％以上。过去“吃劳保”的人，都自动作了检讨。在工人心目中，装病旷工“吃劳保”已经成为可耻的了。杜儿坪矿的医务所，过去每天排队看病有一百多人，现在只有二十人左右。护士张云说：“整风运动真好，病号也少了。”工人的组织性、纪律性大大加强了。基层干部和一些技术人员说：“过去磨烂了嘴，跑断了腿，许多工人还是不听指挥；现在可真好了，人人认真干活，积极性主动性非常高。”公共食堂的炊事员也说：“工人现在吃饭自动排队，不吵不闹；摔盘子摔碗打人骂人的事再也看不见了。”在福利问题上，要求过高的现象没有了。有些抢占宿舍的人，已经自动让出不合理的多占的房子。有些乱拿公家家具的人，也自动到总务科去补写借据，有的退回多拿的火炉、烟筒、茶壶、床板等等。所以，主管总务和福利的工作人员说：“现在事情好办多了。”（附图片）
    还没有到上班时间，这些工人就先来作准备工作了。
