    Northwest Agricultural College
    Compiling the Next Year's Scientific Research Plan
    After discussions among the heads of various departments, the director of the farm, and the heads of directly affiliated teaching and research groups, Northwest Agricultural College decided that the compilation of the 1958 scientific research plan should implement the principle of closely integrating production, education, and scientific research, and strengthen connections and cooperation with units such as the Academy of Agricultural Sciences. In the process of compilation, the research topics conducted in 1957 should first be reviewed to determine whether to continue them. Among them, those that can be included in the national science plan should be included in the national major research project plan as much as possible, and new research projects should be proposed, selecting topics that meet the requirements of the national plan as much as possible. Efforts should also be made to select scientific research projects proposed by business departments that need to be solved. In order to establish close ties with the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, various departments and teaching and research groups will actively invite relevant comrades from the Academy of Agricultural Sciences and other units to participate in the discussion of the plan.
    Sichuan Agricultural College Teachers
    Conducting a Comprehensive Survey in Erlang Mountain
    In order to lay the foundation for carrying out agricultural scientific research in mountainous areas, the Scientific Research Committee of Sichuan Agricultural College mobilized more than 30 teachers from various departments to form the Erlang Mountain Comprehensive Survey Team during the summer vacation and conducted a survey on the east and west sides of Erlang Mountain. They collected a large number of crop varieties, wild plant and animal specimens, and materials related to mountain farming systems and the management of advanced agricultural cooperatives and brought them back to the school, which will greatly enrich the materials and teaching content for future research and development of mountain production.
    The resources in the Erlang Mountain area are very rich, and it is a place where temperate and tropical plants and animals converge north and south. The teachers were very enthusiastic about collecting due to the abundance of resources. They obtained many valuable materials, such as rice with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu in areas with an altitude of more than 1,300 meters; corn with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu in areas with an altitude of 2,400 meters; cactus communities, hazelnut communities, and many other plant communities and endless forests along the Kangzang Highway. This time, they collected more than 400 different varieties of plant specimens alone, and discovered more than 30 varieties of pears alone, among which the honey pear is even better than the famous Sydney pear. There are truly many livestock such as horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, and pigs, and there are also many types of feed. This time, they also discovered gum-containing plants and two different types of wild mountain sweet potatoes that were different from those found in Baoxing.
    Currently, the teachers are sorting out this large batch of materials.
    Nanjing University Launches New Course
    "Saussure's General Linguistics" Course
    Professor Fang Guangtao of the Chinese Department of Nanjing University has launched a new course, "Saussure's General Linguistics."
    Saussure was the leader of the French and Swiss linguistic schools at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. His linguistic theories have influenced France, the United States, Britain, Switzerland, the Czech Republic... even the Soviet Union and China, so the exploration of Saussure's linguistic theories is of international significance. The Soviet journal "Problems of Linguistics" has recently launched a discussion on structuralism. Structuralist methods of analyzing language have already made some contributions to the major issue of machine translation. Therefore, if we want to study machine translation, we must understand structuralism, understand the merits and demerits of structuralism, and evaluate its achievements and shortcomings. We must first start by understanding Saussure's theories.
    Professor Fang Guangtao studied Saussure's linguistic works when he was studying in Japan and France in his youth. Therefore, this specialized course is a summary of his more than 30 years of research on Saussure's theories. The opening of this course is the first time in the country. While the Academy of Sciences entrusts Professor Fang Guangtao to translate Saussure's representative work "Course in General Linguistics," he will also prepare to publish scientific research papers on this topic.

    Nanjing Institute of Technology
    Political Teachers Participate in Rural Work
    According to the plan of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee's Department of Culture and Education to transfer political theory teachers from schools to rural areas to participate in practical training, five teachers from the Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Group of Nanjing Institute of Technology went to rural areas in the Yangzhou Prefecture to participate in practical work for a period of three months to half a year. The main purpose of their going to the countryside this time is to strengthen their self-reform through practical training in rural work.
    After arriving in the countryside, they will eat, live, and share weal and woe with the peasants, actively participate in various rural work, especially the great debate on socialist ideological education in rural areas.

    西北农学院
    编制明年科学研究计划
    西北农学院经各系主任、农场场长及直属教研组主任讨论后，决定编制1958年科学研究计划应贯彻生产、教育、科学研究紧密结合的方针，并加强与农业科学研究所等单位的联系合作。在编制过程中，应首先将1957年所进行的研究题目加以复查，决定继续进行与否。其中可以列入国家科学规划的应尽量争取纳入国家主要研究项目计划之内，提出新的研究项目，要尽量选择符合国家规划要求的题目。并应争取选择业务部门所提出需要解决的科学研究项目。为了与农业科学研究所取得密切连系，各系、教研组在讨论计划时，将主动邀请农业科学研究所等单位有关同志参加。
    四川农学院教师
    在二郎山进行综合调查
    为开展山区农业科学研究工作打下基础，四川农学院科学研究委员会在暑期中，动员了各系三十多位教师组成二郎山综合调查队，到二郎山东西两面进行了一次调查。采集了大批农作物品种，野生动植物标本，和有关山区耕作制度、高级农业社经营管理等资料回到了学校，它将大大丰富今后研究发展山区生产的材料和教学内容。
    二郎山区的资源很丰富，是温带，热带动植物南北交汇之地。教师们见到资源丰富，采集劲头都很大。他们得到了许多宝贵的资料，如海拔一千三百多公尺的地区有亩产一千斤以上的水稻；海拔二千四百公尺的地区有亩产一千斤以上的玉米；沿康藏公路有仙人掌群落，榛子群落等许多植物群落和一望无垠的森林。这次单是植物就采集了四百多号不同品种的标本，单是梨就发现了三十多种品种，其中的蜂蜜梨比有名的雪梨还好。家畜真是马、牛、羊、鸡、犬、豕都产得很多，饲料种类也多。这次还发现了含胶植物和与曾在宝兴发现的不同的两种野生山红苕。
    现在，教师们正在整理这一大批资料。
    南京大学新开
    “索绪耳的一般语言学”课程
    南京大学中文系方光焘教授新开了“索绪耳的一般语言学”课程。
    索绪耳是十九世纪末二十世纪初法国、瑞士语言学派的领袖。他的语言学说影响了法国、美国、英国、瑞士、捷克……以至于苏联和中国，所以对于索绪尔语言学说的探讨是具有国际意义的。苏联“语言学问题”杂志最近一年来展开了关于结构主义问题的讨论，结构主义分析语言的方法已经在机器翻译这一重大问题上作出了某些贡献，因此我们要研究机器翻译，那一定要认识结构主义，要认识结构主义的功过，评定它的成绩和缺点，那首先要从了解索绪耳的学说开始。
    方光焘教授年青时在留学日本和法国时就研究索绪耳的语言学著作，所以这门专门化课程也就是他三十多年来研究索绪耳学说的一个小结。开设这方面的课程，目前在全国还是第一次。在科学院委托方光焘教授翻译索绪耳代表作“一般语言学教程”一书的同时，他还将准备发表有关这方面的科学研究论文。　　　　　　　　　　　（文涛）

    政治教师参加农村工作
    根据江苏省委文教部关于抽调学校政治理论教师到农村参加实际锻炼的计划，南京工学院马列主义教研组教师五人到扬州专区的农村参加为期三个月到半年的实际工作。他们此次下乡的主要目的是通过农村工作的实际锻炼以加强自我改造。
    他们到达农村后，将与农民同吃同住，同甘共苦，积极参加农村各项工作，特别是农村社会主义思想教育的大辩论活动。
