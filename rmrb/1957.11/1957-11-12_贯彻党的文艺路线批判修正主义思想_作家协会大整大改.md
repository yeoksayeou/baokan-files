Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The Chinese Writers Association's rectification movement, having achieved a great victory in the anti-rightist struggle, has entered the stage of large-scale rectification and reform. Since the Writers Association Rectification Leadership Group convened a meeting of staff members in late October, and Shao Quanlin, Secretary of the Chinese Writers Association Party Group, and Liu Baiyu, Deputy Secretary, delivered mobilization reports on resolutely implementing the Party's literary line and entering the rectification and reform stage, a new high tide of speaking out freely has been set off in the Writers Association and its affiliated departments.

	Many writers and poets in Beijing are about to go to the countryside and factories to immerse themselves in life for extended periods, and the Writers Association Secretariat's decision to abolish the resident writer system is an important step in further implementing the Party's literary line. When discussing the significance of writers immersing themselves in life, Shao Quanlin and Liu Baiyu both pointed out that the anti-rightist struggle has shattered the bourgeoisie's literary line, and in the rectification and reform stage, it is necessary to further implement the Party's literary line and earnestly implement the policy of literature serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Whether writers can truly integrate with workers and peasants is the fundamental question of whether they can implement the Party's literary line. They pointed out that many veteran writers who are going to the countryside and factories this time generally have experience in participating in mass struggles, but they are still willing to continue to train themselves in grassroots work and production labor for a long time, sharing weal and woe with the masses, so as to profoundly reflect the great social changes and the life and struggles of the people through their works. This will play an extremely important role in establishing and expanding the working class's literary ranks and further enriching literary creation.

	The Writers Association Secretariat, at a recent meeting, requested that its affiliated publications further implement the policy of integrating publications with the masses, strengthen mass character and combat effectiveness, better implement the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, thoroughly correct the past errors in line and thought of these publications, as well as the shortcomings in editorial work, so that they become truly socialist literary strongholds; at the same time, it reorganized the editorial boards of "People's Literature," "Literary Gazette," "Poetry," and "Translations," etc. Currently, the editorial departments of these publications are studying and formulating plans to improve their work and are preparing to further carry out discussions on the literary line and criticism of bourgeois ideology.

	Resolutely streamlining institutions, improving work efficiency, and transferring cadres to lower levels are the urgent demands of staff members of the Writers Association and its affiliated departments since the start of rectification and reform. The masses have raised various criticisms and suggestions on this issue in many big-character posters. Many Communist Youth League members and staff members have expressed their determination to go to grassroots departments and labor, striving to train themselves into intellectuals of the working class. The Writers Association Secretariat is currently studying these criticisms and suggestions and is starting the work of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres to lower levels. According to preliminary plans, it is estimated that 45% to 50% of the staff members of the Writers Association and its affiliated departments can be transferred to lower levels, and the institutions will be downsized, the levels reduced, and work efficiency will be further improved. The Writers Association Secretariat recently also decided to suspend the Literary Training Class so that young authors have the opportunity to receive real training and transformation in the upsurge of socialist construction, in living and struggling together with the masses.

	Following the basic conclusion of the anti-rightist struggle, the Writers Association immediately began criticizing revisionist thought in the literary field. This work of ideological criticism will be further expanded in the rectification and reform stage. So far, the Chinese Writers Association Party Group has held five enlarged meetings to systematically criticize the revisionist thought of Wei Junyi, editor-in-chief of "Literary Study," and Huang Qiuyun, a member of the editorial board, on literary issues. Wei Junyi and Huang Qiuyun have made preliminary self-criticisms.

	Since the start of rectification and reform, the masses have put up many big-character posters, raising many criticisms and suggestions on the future work of the Writers Association, such as strengthening ideological leadership, strengthening the Writers Association's contact with writers, and overcoming bureaucratic work styles. Now the Writers Association Rectification Leadership Group has reviewed the situation of speaking out freely after the mobilization report and will convene meetings by category to further expand the scope of speaking out freely. Since the start of rectification, fifteen party member cadres, including responsible personnel, have voluntarily requested to lower their ranks, and the Writers Association Secretariat has approved them to be downgraded to the levels they held before the promotion last year.

    贯彻党的文艺路线批判修正主义思想
    作家协会大整大改
    据新华社11日讯　中国作家协会的整风运动在反右派斗争取得巨大胜利的基础上，已经转入了大整大改阶段。自从10月下旬作家协会整风领导小组召开机关工作人员大会，中共作家协会党组书记邵荃麟、副书记刘白羽在会上就坚决贯彻党的文艺路线和进入整改阶段作了动员报告以后，在作家协会和所属部门中掀起了一个新的大鸣大放的高潮。
    在京的许多作家和诗人即将下乡下厂长期深入生活以及作家协会书记处决定取消驻会作家制度，这是进一步贯彻党的文艺路线的一个重要步骤。邵荃麟、刘白羽在谈到作家深入生活的意义时都指出，反右派斗争粉碎了资产阶级的文艺路线，在整改阶段就要进一步贯彻党的文艺路线，认真实行文艺为工农兵服务的方针。作家能否真正同工农结合是能否贯彻党的文艺路线的根本问题。他们指出，这次下乡下厂的许多老作家一般都有参加群众斗争的经验，但是他们仍然愿意继续在基层工作和生产劳动中长期地锻炼自己，和群众同甘苦共呼吸，以便通过作品深刻地反映伟大的社会变革和人民的生活与斗争。这对建立和扩大工人阶级的文学队伍和进一步繁荣文学创作，都将起极其重要的作用。
    作家协会书记处在最近召开的一次会议上要求所属刊物进一步贯彻刊物同群众结合的方针，加强群众性、战斗性，更好地贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针，彻底纠正这些刊物过去在路线上和思想上的错误以及编辑工作中的缺点，使它们成为名副其实的社会主义文学的阵地；同时改组了“人民文学”、“文艺报”、“诗刊”、“译文”等的编辑委员会。目前这些刊物的编辑部正在研究和制定改进工作的计划，并准备进一步开展关于文艺路线的讨论和对资产阶级思想的批判。
    坚决地紧缩机构、提高工作效率、下放干部，是整改开始以来作家协会以及所属部门工作人员的迫切要求，群众在许多大字报中对这个问题提出了各种批评和建议，不少共青团员和工作人员都表示决心到基层部门和劳动中去，争取把自己锻炼成为工人阶级的知识分子。作家协会书记处目前正在研究这些批评和建议，着手紧缩机构、下放干部的工作。根据初步计划，作家协会和所属部门的工作人员预计可以下放45％到50％，并且缩小机构，减少层次，进一步提高工作效率。作家协会书记处最近还决定停办文学讲习所，以便青年作者都有机会在社会主义建设的热潮中，在和群众共同生活和斗争中，使自己受到真正的锻炼和改造。
    作家协会在反右派斗争基本结束后，紧接着就开始了对文学领域内修正主义思想的批判。这种思想批判的工作，在整风整改阶段中还将进一步展开。到目前为止，中共作家协会党组已经召开了五次扩大会议，对“文艺学习”主编韦君宜和编委黄秋云两同志在文艺问题上的修正主义思想，进行了系统的批判。韦君宜、黄秋云已经作了初步检讨。
    整改开始以来，群众贴出很多大字报，对作家协会今后的工作，如加强思想领导、加强作协同作家的联系、克服官僚主义作风等，提出了许多批评和建议。现在作家协会整风领导小组检查了动员报告后的鸣放情况，并将分门别类召开会议，进一步展开大放大鸣。整风开始以来，已经有包括负责人员在内的十五名党员干部自动要求降低自己的级别，作协书记处已批准他们分别降到去年提级以前的级别。
