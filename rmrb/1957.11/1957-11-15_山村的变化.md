Changes in a Mountain Village
Qi Mingyu

Thirty *li* west from Jiyuan County along the Ji-Shao Highway, one enters the Taihang Mountain area, 1,350 meters above sea level. The surrounding mountains rise and fall, and the slopes and valleys are covered with dense forests. At the foot of the mountains, gullies crisscross, and small villages are scattered deep in the forests. This is Li Bazhuang Township in Jiyuan County, a forestry model unit recently rewarded by the Ministry of Forestry.

Two Different Worlds, Then and Now

Anyone who visited Li Bazhuang Township ten years ago would be greatly surprised if they revisited today. At that time, all the mountains and valleys were barren, reddish-brown was everywhere, and there were so few plants that even the artemisia looked like the sparse hairs on a mangy head. The small gullies on the hillsides, eroded by rainwater, exposed layers of rocks. The climate was erratic, and the area was constantly threatened by seven major disasters: drought, flood, inundation, wind, hail, frost, and freezing, with drought being the most severe. Planting crops yielded no harvest. At that time, a folk song reflecting the people's suffering circulated: "Gruel in the morning, watery soup at noon, thin porridge at dusk under the moonlight, no cotton clothes to wear in winter."

In the thirteen years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, Li Bazhuang Township has taken on a new look. Oak trees now grow from the top of the mountains to the bottom, with dense branches and leaves. Near the villages, fat cattle and sheep, in groups of yellow and white, run around in the lush green pastures and bushes. In the valleys, new stone and earth check dams have been built, and small reservoirs have been constructed where the valleys converge. The banks of the gullies are filled with various fruit trees such as persimmon, pear, peach, apricot, Chinese prickly ash, and walnut. In the mountain basins, all kinds of crops grow beautifully and neatly, one patch better than the next.

An Intractable "Knot"

How did Li Bazhuang Township become the village it is today, surrounded by green mountains and trees?

It is a long story.

As early as the winter of 1948—the fourth winter after the local liberation—the Communist Party and the People's Government proposed to the mountain people the idea of closing the mountains for afforestation and greening the barren hills, and introduced many experiences from other places in greening barren mountains. The Party branch actively responded to the Party's call, formulated measures such as stopping the cultivation of steep slopes and closing the mountains for afforestation, and decided to implement them throughout the village.

The promotion of a new experience will always encounter resistance from various traditional forces. After the new spirit of closing the mountains for afforestation was announced to the farmers, discussions immediately arose everywhere:

"Relying on those few acres of poor land, we can barely harvest a few grains and勉强 manage to support our families; if we abandon the hillside fields, what will the hundreds of people in the village eat?"

Not only were those who were accustomed to recklessly reclaiming land dissatisfied, but those who grazed cattle and sheep also had objections.

The Party branch repeatedly explained to everyone that closing the mountains for afforestation would bring great income and many benefits, but people still thought that distant water could not quench immediate thirst. The problem became more and more confusing, and even those who were originally active began to suspect that it would lead to a situation where "we guard the barren mountains but have no firewood to burn, and the cattle and sheep have nothing to eat."

After much trouble, the "knot" was not untied even after a whole winter of arguing. The matter was thus put aside.

A Way Found

Although the first shot was not successful, the idea of closing the mountains for afforestation had left a deep impression on people's minds. It so happened that it was also after the land reform, when mountain farmers were divided the mountains, demarcated boundaries, and determined land rights, becoming truly the owners of the land for the first time in history. Each household was assigned a piece of hillside. How to manage it in the future? This was a question that every farmer had to consider in their hearts.

The problem was first solved in Huling Village.

Huling Village was the fourth *lv* of Li Bazhuang Administrative Village at that time, and turned-over farmer Cao Yongjian was elected *lv* head.

One evening, Cao Yongjian invited several mutual aid team leaders and several old men to his home to talk about closing the mountains for afforestation, but whenever they touched on how to obtain grain, where to graze cattle and sheep, and where to gather firewood, they could not come up with a solution.

Squatting on the side, Cao Yongjian rubbed his hands and scratched his head for a while. Suddenly, as if he had realized something, he walked to the table and said, "Land reform can divide the mountains and demarcate boundaries, so can't we demarcate a large boundary again, divide the mountains into several parts, some for growing trees, some for grazing cattle and sheep, and some for gathering firewood?"

One sentence broke the silence, and people felt much more open-minded. Old man Cao Yufa, who usually did not speak much, also interjected, "As long as we don't recklessly cut down small trees, we can grow large forests in a few years. In the future, we should only cut branches and not dig up roots for firewood; to concentrate on cultivating the forest, we should no longer plant mountain land (steep slopes). We should build more terraced fields at the foot of the slope, raise the ridges of the fields a little higher, plant less and cultivate well, and we can still harvest a lot of grain." As they talked, they demarcated mountain boundaries, and everyone was happy. That night, they also established a mountain closure and forest protection committee and organized a fire prevention and forest protection team. Everyone said happily, "Three cobblers are as good as a Zhuge Liang."

The new method was quickly implemented. In the autumn, Cao Yongjian led everyone to plant twenty-five *mu* of oak trees on barren mountains where there were no young forests to close and cultivate, and closed and cultivated four thousand *mu* of mountains while building. Under the leadership of Jiao Wenhai, the fire brigade extinguished seven mountain fires in a year, protecting the forests.

In the spring of the following year, the Party branch systematically organized the experience of closing the mountains for afforestation in Huling Village and quickly promoted it in other villages of Li Bazhuang Administrative Village and the two administrative villages of Yuhuangmiao and Yuyang.

Marching into the Mountains

In the spring of 1954, after Cao Yongjian was named a special-class forestry labor model in the county, he felt a little satisfied; that autumn, he attended the provincial labor model conference, and this conference sounded an alarm for him. After listening to Governor Wu's report and Cheng Baifu's speech, he felt very heavy. He began to feel that his achievements were not great, but his shortcomings were many. And the most significant shortcoming was precisely what Governor Wu pointed out in his report: he did not understand the characteristics of the mountain area, did not grasp the important link of soil and water conservation, and did not know that the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry was the fundamental direction for building the mountain area.

After returning from the provincial conference, he went to the Party branch secretary Zheng Liyun before going home, conveyed the spirit of the provincial conference, and introduced some experiences from other places. From that time on, the Party branch conducted a comprehensive plan combining agriculture, forestry, and water, and led the masses to fully march into the mountains. In addition to establishing forestry professional teams to continue afforestation, forest tending, and closing the mountains for afforestation, they began to build check dams in the valleys and 修淤地坝 (sediment trapping dams), and 修堎垒堰 (terraced fields with stone embankments) on the slopes; they also began to build dams to control and stabilize riverbeds in the rivers. All kinds of work were started. The masses were very satisfied with the Party's comprehensive plan and comprehensive management measures and called the Party branch the command headquarters for developing the mountain area. However, at that time, the farmers were not fully organized, and there were only a few elementary cooperatives, and they were unable to build many larger projects such as reservoirs, stone check dams, and river dams.

The upsurge of agricultural cooperativization came at the end of the winter of 1955 and the beginning of the spring of 1956. Li Bazhuang Township formed three advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and in the autumn, it conducted another comprehensive mountain production plan, creating conditions for large-scale construction of the mountain area. One upsurge followed another. In the first half of this year, an agricultural cooperative in Li Bazhuang built three small reservoirs, one water interception dam, twenty stone check dams, and also built water ponds, river dams, and water cellars; they also renovated terraced fields, built stone weirs, repaired drainage ditches, and built up field edges, storing a total of more than 28,000 cubic meters of floodwater, silted up 39 *mu* of land, irrigated 156 *mu* of land, and controlled soil erosion over an area of 20 square *li*.

In these eight years, there have been no mountain forest fires in the township. More than 640,000 trees have been planted, and a total of more than 3,800 *mu* of new forests have been planted including sowing on barren mountains. Forest tending and nurturing young forests have reached more than 140,000 *mu*. The township already has more than 61,000 *mu* of forest gardens. More than 45,000 various fruit trees have been newly grafted.

Life Has Improved

How does the current life of the farmers in Li Bazhuang Township compare with that before liberation? If you ask the farmers here, they will only answer you with a short sentence: There is simply no comparison.

Before liberation, the grain yield per *mu* in Li Bazhuang Township was only 63 *jin*, and the grain harvested throughout the year was not enough to eat for half a year; after liberation, the grain yield increased year by year, and in 1956, the grain yield per *mu* reached more than 196 *jin*, with a total output of more than 5.76 million *jin*. In addition to paying agricultural tax and providing for the township's consumption, more than 680,000 *jin* were sold to the state. At the time of liberation, the township had no flocks of sheep or pigs, and there were very few livestock. Now there are more than 2,200 livestock, more than 1,200 pigs, and more than 2,200 sheep. The income is more than just this! According to incomplete statistics from the three agricultural cooperatives of Li Bazhuang, Yuhuangmiao, and Yuyang in 1956 alone: the income from fruits such as persimmons, walnuts, peaches, apricots, and pears, native products such as medicinal materials, acorns, and Chinese prickly ash, and animal products such as pigs, sheep, and eggs, excluding the part used for self-consumption, totaled more than 99,000 yuan.

Speaking of the family life of the cooperative members, let's take the example of Jia Xianfu, who still lives in poverty in Huling Village in the township. Before liberation, his family of nine had 20 *mu* of land, which yielded less than 2,000 *jin* of grain a year. The whole family worked hard all year round, and could not even eat a white steamed bun during the Spring Festival. In 1943, the whole family died due to famine, leaving only him. What about now? He has five people in his family, with a bed and bedding, and surplus grain.

              × × ×

Now, under the leadership of the Party, the farmers of Li Bazhuang Township are engaged in persistent and selfless labor on the tops of the mountains, on the hillsides, and in the valleys. From their planning program, it can be seen that after the completion of the Third Five-Year Plan, they can produce 15 million *jin* of grain annually, and export 15,000 tons of timber and 860,000 *jin* of mountain fruits annually. At that time, the farmers of Li Bazhuang Township will, like the people of the whole country, live a richer, happier, and more fulfilling life in the big family of socialist society.

    山村的变化
    齐鸣宇
    出济源县城，顺济邵公路西行三十里，便进入海拔一千三百五十公尺的太行山区。四周山峦起伏，各个山坡上、山沟里，到处都是茂密的树林。山脚下的沟壑，纵横交错，山林深处，散布着小小的村庄。这就是最近林业部奖励的林业模范单位——济源县的李八庄乡。
    今昔两个样
    十年前到过李八庄乡的人，如今旧地重游一定会大吃一惊。那时节，所有的山峦峡谷尽是童山秃岭，一片红似一片，不用说树木，连蒿草都少的像癞痢头上的头发一样。山坡上被雨水冲刷的条条小沟，露出了千层岩石。气候不调和，常年受着旱、涝、洪、风、雹、霜、冻七大灾的威胁，尤以旱灾为严重，种地不打粮食。当时曾流传着“山上和尚头，沟里没水流，今年盼明年，年年都不收”这种反映人民痛苦的歌谣。群众每天的生活是：“早上糠，中午汤，黄昏稀饭照月亮，冬天穿不上棉衣裳”。
    解放十三年来，在共产党的领导下，李八庄乡已经出现了崭新的面貌。从山顶到山底长满了栎树，茂密的枝叶，靠近村庄附近的山坡上，黄一群白一群肥壮的牛羊在绿油油的牧草场上和灌木丛里跑来跑去。山沟里，新筑起一串串的石谷坊和土谷坊，沟口汇集处修筑了小型水库，沟岸上，长满了柿、梨、桃、杏、花椒、核桃等各种果树，山谷盆地，各样庄稼，一块比一块长的漂亮、齐整。难解的“疙瘩”
    李八庄乡是怎样变成今天这样被青山绿树环绕着的一个村庄呢？
    说起来话就长了。
    还是在1948年的冬天——当地解放后的第四年冬天，共产党和人民政府就向山区人民提出了封山育林、绿化荒山，并介绍了许多外地绿化荒山的经验。党支部就积极响应党的号召，制定了停止陡坡耕种、封山育林等办法，决定在全村贯彻执行。
    一个新经验的推广，总会遇到各种各样传统势力的阻挠和抵抗。封山育林的新精神向农民宣布以后，立刻就到处议论起来了：
    “就凭那几亩薄地多少打几颗粮食，勉强还可以养家顾口；要是丢掉坡地不种，全村几百口人吃啥呀？”
    不但习惯了满山乱开荒的人不满意，放牛放羊的人也有意见。
    党支部再三向大家解释封山造林收入大、好处多的道理，人们仍然认为远水不能解近渴。问题越弄越糊涂，连原来积极的也怀疑会弄成“守着荒山没柴烧，牛羊难放吃不饱”的局面。
      费了不少周折，整整吵嚷了一冬天也没有解开这个“疙瘩”。事情就这样放了下来。
    找到了途径
    头一炮虽没打响，但封山育林已在人们的脑海里留下了深刻的印象。当时恰恰又是土地改革以后，山区农民分山划界、确定地权，在历史上第一次真正成了土地的主人。每户都分到一片山坡，今后如何经营呢？是每一个农民内心不得不考虑的问题。
    问题是先从虎岭村解决的。
    虎岭村是当时李八庄行政村的第四闾，翻身农民曹永建被选任了闾长。
    一个晚上，曹永建把几个互助组长和几个老头请到自己家里，谈封山育林的事，但一扯到粮食怎么办，牛羊到哪里放，柴到何处拾，就都说不出办法来了。
    蹲在一边的曹永建，一会儿搓搓手，一会儿搔搔头，忽然他若有所悟地走近桌前说：“土改能分山划界，咱就不能再划个大界，把山分成几份，有的长树、有的放牛羊、有的拾柴火吗？”
    一句话点破了沉默的局面，人们的心里觉得开朗了许多。平素不多说话的曹玉法老头也插言道：“只要不乱砍小树，过几年就能养成大林，往后拾柴只准砍枝梢不准刨疙瘩；要安心养林，就不要再种山地（陡坡）啦，把坡根多修几块水口地，地边堎堰垫得高一点，少种种好，一样多打粮食。”说着说着，大伙就划起山界来了，划得大家都很乐意。当天晚上，他们又成立了封山护林委员会，组织了防火护林大队。大家高兴地说：“真是三个臭皮匠，顶一个诸葛亮”。
    新办法很快就实行起来了。秋天，曹永建又领着大家在没有幼林可封育的荒山上，试造点种了二十五亩栎树，边修边封了四千亩山。防火队在焦文海的领导下，一年内连续扑灭了七次山火，保护了山林。
    第二年春天，党支部系统地整理了虎岭村的封山育林经验，很快就在李八庄行政村的其它村庄和玉皇庙、玉阳两个行政村里推行起来了。
    向山区进军
    1954年春季，曹永建被评为全县特等林业劳动模范以后，心里有点满足了；当年秋天，他又出席了全省的劳动模范大会，这一次大会给他敲了警钟。听了吴省长的报告和成百福的发言，使他感到心情很沉重。他开始感到自己的成绩不大，倒是缺点不少。而最重大的缺点，正是吴省长在报告中所指出的：不了解山区的特点，没抓住水土保持这一重要环节，不知道农、林、牧全面发展是建设山区的根本方向。
    省里开会回来，他没到家就去找党支部书记郑立运，传达了省里会议精神和介绍了一些外地经验。就从这个时候开始，党支部进行了农、林、水相结合的全面规划，领导广大群众向山区全面进军。除建立林业专业队继续造林、修林、封山育林外，山沟里开始闸谷坊、修淤地坝，坡地梯田切里外垫、修堎垒堰；河道里开始筑坝收滩治理河床。各项工作都动手了。群众对党的全面规划、综合治理措施很满意，把党支部叫做开发山区的司令部。但是，那时农民还没有完全组织起来，只有几个初级社，水库、石谷坊和拦河坝等很多较大工程都无力修建。
    1955年冬末和1956年春初农业合作化的高潮来到。李八庄乡组成了三个高级农业生产合作社，秋季又进行了一次全面的山区生产规划，为大规模的建设山区创造了条件。一个高潮接着一个高潮，李八庄一个农业社今年上半年，修建小型水库三座、截水坝一个、石谷坊二十座、还修了水塘、拦河坝、水窖；又整修梯田，垒石堰，修排水渠，培地边，共拦蓄洪水二万八千余方，淤地三十九亩，浇地一百五十六亩，能控制水土流失面积二十平方里。
    这八年，全乡没有发生过山林失火。植树六十四万余株，连荒山播种共新造林三千八百余亩。修林和抚育幼林达十四万多亩次。全乡已有六万一千余亩林园。新嫁接各种果树四万五千多棵。
    生活改善了
    李八庄乡农民现在的生活和解放前比较起来怎么样？要问这里农民，他们只回答你简短的一句话：根本不能比。
    解放前，李八庄乡每亩粮食产量只六十三斤，全年打的粮食不够半年吃；解放后粮食产量逐年提高，1956年每亩粮食产量达一百九十六斤多，总产量为五百七十六万余斤，除交纳农业税和全乡吃用外，卖给国家六十八万余斤。刚解放时，全乡羊没一群、猪没一头，牲口寥寥无几，现在已有牲口二千二百余头，猪一千二百余口，羊二千二百多只。收入何止这些！仅据李八庄、玉皇庙、玉阳三个农业社1956年的不完全统计：柿子、核桃、桃、杏、板梨等果类，药材、橡子、花椒等土特产品，以及猪、羊、鸡蛋等畜产除自用部分外，共收入九万九千余元。
    说到社员家庭生活，就拿该乡虎岭村现在仍是贫农生活的贾先富这一户来说吧。解放前全家九口人，二十亩地一年打不到二千斤粮食，全家终年辛勤劳动，过年也吃不上一个白馍。1943年全家因灾荒年死的只剩下他一个人了。现在呢？孩子老婆共五口人，有铺有盖，有余粮。
              ×　×　×
    现在，李八庄乡的农民正在党的领导下，在山顶上、山坡上、山沟里进行坚持不懈地忘我劳动。从他们的规划方案里可以看出，到第三个五年计划完成后，可以年产一千五百万斤粮食，每年能输出一万五千吨木材和八十六万斤山果。那时候，李八庄乡的农民将和全国人民一样，在社会主义社会的大家庭里，过着更富裕、更幸福、更美满的生活。
