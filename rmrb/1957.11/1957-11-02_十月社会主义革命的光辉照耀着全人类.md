    The Glory of the October Socialist Revolution Illuminates All Mankind
    Zhang Xiruo
    The fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution is approaching, and we are greeting this great festival of world significance with incomparable excitement and joy.
    On the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, we want to cheer for the incomparably brilliant construction achievements of the Soviet Union, to cheer for the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the shining light of the October Revolution, and also to cheer for the new developments and new progress in the revolutionary and construction undertakings of the socialist countries and the working people of the world. As we greet the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution today, we are delighted to see that its influence is unprecedentedly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the socialist system is increasingly showing its enormous and eternal superiority and vitality.
    The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history—an era of the collapse of capitalism and the establishment of socialism. The October Revolution realized the aspirations of the working people for generations, declared the death of the system of exploitation, and for the first time established the political power of the working people themselves, realizing the great ideals of socialism, peace, and equality and friendship among all nationalities. In this way, it pointed out to the proletariat of the world the only correct path to complete liberation, encouraged their confidence in the struggle, and thus enabled them to consciously engage in the glorious cause of changing history and creating history.
    Forty years, what a short period in the entire history of mankind. But in these forty years, under the leadership of the great Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people have achieved astonishing and enormous achievements in defending and developing the achievements of the October Revolution and in carrying out socialist construction. By the end of 1956, the growth of Soviet industry had reached more than thirty times that of the pre-revolutionary period, while the growth of heavy industry was more than fifty times that of the pre-revolutionary period. With the rapid development of industry, the development of agricultural production in the Soviet Union is also astonishing. At present, the Soviet Union has the world's largest and most mechanized agriculture. The output of many important agricultural products, such as wheat, potatoes, and beets, is the world's highest. On the basis of the development of industry and agriculture, the Soviet Union has carried out enormous cultural construction and educational construction. In a country where 76% of the population over the age of nine were illiterate before the revolution, seven-year compulsory education has now been universalized, and the transition to ten-year universal education has begun. The Soviet Union has long surpassed any capitalist country in terms of training specialized personnel. Today, the Soviet Union has the most advanced science and technology in the world. From the application of atomic energy to peaceful construction, the success of intercontinental missile tests, and the recent launch of the first artificial satellite, a series of facts show that Soviet science and technology have jumped to the first place in the world. That is to say, the Soviet Union has pushed modern science and technology into a new era, showing mankind a more glorious and happier future. All of this most powerfully proves the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. At the same time, the Soviet Union's forty years of construction achievements also prove that the working masses can not only destroy the old and decadent social system, but also build their own free and happy new country in the best way.
    While actively striving to engage in socialist construction in its own country, the Soviet Union has also consistently carried out tireless struggles to defend world peace and the cause of human progress. Today, the Soviet Union has become a decisive factor in international political life and a strong fortress of world peace. Since the Second World War, the main goal of Soviet foreign policy has been to maintain world peace, prevent the occurrence of new wars, and ease international tensions. The Soviet Union has strongly advocated disarmament, banning the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and strongly advocated that countries with different social systems should coexist peacefully. At previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, Soviet representatives have repeatedly put forward proposals to safeguard the principles of the United Nations Charter, promote international cooperation, and oppose war propaganda. At the recent twelfth session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union again proposed that the General Assembly adopt a declaration on peaceful coexistence among countries on the basis of the Five Principles. These have powerfully struck at the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism and promoted a policy of peace. It is especially worth mentioning that last year, the Soviet Union played a decisive role in preventing imperialist aggression against Egypt and in helping Hungary defeat the counter-revolutionary restoration. Recently, the Soviet Union issued a stern warning against the US imperialist conspiracy to create tension in the Middle East and instigate Turkey to launch a war of aggression against Syria. It once again demonstrated that the Soviet Union is the defender of human justice and peace. It will powerfully frustrate the imperialist aggression against Arab countries and greatly encourage these countries' determination to oppose colonialism.
    The October Socialist Revolution pointed out the correct path to victory for our country's revolutionary cause. As Chairman Mao said: "The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." From then on, the face of the Chinese revolution was renewed. It was precisely because of the Chinese Communist Party established under the influence of the October Revolution, and because of the strong leadership of the Communist Party, that the Chinese revolution achieved a glorious victory after a long and arduous struggle. It is precisely for this reason that the Chinese people have always regarded their revolution as a continuation of the great October Socialist Revolution, and regard it as the greatest honor.
    The Soviet Union's assistance to the construction cause of the new China is known to the world. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union has continuously provided us with comprehensive and selfless assistance. In the past eight years, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other relevant agreements, the Soviet Union has helped our country rapidly restore the national economy and develop socialist construction through preferential loans, the development of trade, helping to design enterprises, supplying complete sets of equipment and technical data, sending experts, and scientific and technological and cultural cooperation. It is particularly worth mentioning that the 211 important enterprises that the Soviet Union helped our country build, especially the 156 enterprises that the Soviet Union helped our country build during the first five-year plan, are of great significance for realizing our country's socialist industrialization. At the same time, according to the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement, the Soviet Union will also give us great assistance in science and technology, especially in the research work on the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, which will enable our country to get rid of the backward state of science and technology in a relatively short period of time. In short, in all our country's construction undertakings, we have received the guidance of Soviet experience and technical assistance, and every achievement of ours has been permeated with the hard work of Soviet comrades. We will never forget such a noble spirit of internationalism of the Soviet people.
    Today, a noble obligation placed before each of us is to defend the glorious path of the October Revolution and further consolidate and develop Sino-Soviet friendship. The forty years of experience of the Soviet Union and the experience of our country's revolution and construction have proved that the October Revolution is not only the broad road for the Soviet proletariat to move towards socialism, but also the common broad road for the proletariat of the world to move towards socialism now and in the future. Taking this road will inevitably lead to victory and inevitably lead to eternal freedom and happiness; leaving this road will never get rid of the situation of being exploited and enslaved. Therefore, we must unswervingly follow the path of the October Revolution and creatively learn from the basic experience of the Soviet revolution and construction. Only in this way can our socialism and even communism be guaranteed to be realized. On the other hand, we must do our best to defend Sino-Soviet friendship and continue to consolidate and develop this friendship. The consolidated alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a powerful pillar for maintaining world peace and promoting human progress. It not only conforms to the highest interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also conforms to the highest interests of the people of the world. In the previous period, our country's bourgeois rightists, taking advantage of the opportunity of the Communist Party's rectification campaign, launched a frantic attack on the Party and the socialist cause. Their important methods of opposing the Party and socialism were to attack Marxism-Leninism, slander the Soviet Union, and negate the basic experience of the Soviet Union and the international communist movement in the forty years since the October Revolution. Their real purpose was to try to make us leave the path of Marxism-Leninism and the October Revolution, change the socialist system, and thus realize the restoration of the bourgeoisie. Obviously, we cannot tolerate such a vicious conspiracy and must thoroughly smash it. And this requires us to continue to deepen the anti-rightist struggle, adhere to Marxism-Leninism, oppose revisionism and dogmatism, and thus realize the complete victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts.
    The forty years since the October Socialist Revolution are the forty years of victory for Marxism-Leninism and communist ideology. In these forty years, the face of the world has undergone fundamental changes. Today, the strength of the socialist camp is growing, the colonial system is disintegrating, the socialist system and communist ideology are increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the glory of the October Socialist Revolution illuminates all mankind. In the past twelve years, more than 1.3 billion people have been liberated from the status of colonial appendages. At present, the total number of communists in the world has exceeded 33 million, and the communist parties of thirteen socialist countries have become ruling parties. These further confirm the inevitability and increasing proximity of the death of capitalism, the establishment of socialism on a global scale, and the gradual approach of the ideal of the complete liberation of mankind.
    Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live Marxism-Leninism!
    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    十月社会主义革命的光辉照耀着全人类
    张奚若
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年就要来到了，我们以无比兴奋和愉快的心情热烈地迎接这个具有世界意义的伟大节日。
    在十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，我们要为苏联无比辉煌的建设成就而欢呼，要为中国人民在十月革命光辉照耀下取得的伟大胜利而欢呼，同时也要为社会主义各国以及全世界劳动人民的革命和建设事业的新发展新进步而欢呼。在迎接十月社会主义革命四十周年的今天，我们高兴地看到，它的影响正空前地深入人心，社会主义制度日益显示出它的巨大和永恒的优越性和生命力。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，为人类历史开辟了一个新的纪元——资本主义崩溃和社会主义确立的纪元。十月革命实现了劳动人民的世世代代的愿望，宣告了剥削制度的死亡，第一次建立了劳动人民自己的政权，实现了社会主义、和平、各民族平等友好的伟大理想。这样，它就为全世界无产者指出了一条唯一正确的彻底解放的道路，鼓舞了他们斗争的信心，从而使他们自觉地从事改变历史和创造历史的光荣事业。
    四十年，这在整个人类历史上是多么短暂的一段。但就在这四十年间，苏联人民在伟大的苏联共产党领导下，在保卫和发展十月革命的成果，在进行社会主义建设方面已经取得了惊人的、无比巨大的成就。到1956年年底，苏联工业的增长已达革命前的三十倍以上，而重工业增长为革命前的五十倍以上。随着工业的飞跃发展，苏联的农业生产的发展也是惊人的。目前苏联拥有世界上规模最大、机械化程度最高的农业、许多重要的农产品如小麦、马铃薯，甜菜等的产量都是世界第一。在工农业发展的基础上，苏联进行了巨大的文化建设和教育建设。在革命前九岁以上的居民中曾经有过76％的文盲这样的国家里，现在已经普及了七年的义务教育，并开始了向十年普及教育过渡。在培养专门人才方面苏联更是早已远远超过任何资本主义国家。今天，苏联已经拥有世界上最先进的科学技术。从原子能在和平建设上的应用，洲际导弹试验的成功，以及最近发射出第一颗人造卫星等一系列事实来看，苏联的科学技术已经跃居世界第一位，也就是说，苏联已经把现代的科学技术推进到一个崭新的时代，为人类展示了更为光辉更为幸福的前景。所有这一切，都最有力地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。同时苏联四十年的建设成就也证明：劳动群众不仅能够摧毁旧的腐朽的社会制度，而且能够最好地建成自己自由幸福的新国家。
    苏联在积极努力从事本国社会主义建设的同时，还一向对保卫世界和平和人类进步事业进行不倦的斗争。今天，苏联已经成为国际政治生活中的决定性因素，成为世界和平的坚强堡垒。在第二次世界大战以后，苏联外交政策的主要目标就是维护世界和平，制止新战争的发生，缓和国际紧张局势。苏联极力主张裁减军备，禁止使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性的武器，极力主张不同社会制度的国家应当和平共处。在历届联合国大会上苏联代表一再提出维护联合国宪章原则、增进国际合作、反对战争宣传等建议，在最近召开的联合国大会第十二届会议上，苏联又提出建议大会通过关于各国在五项原则基础上和平共处的宣言。这些都有力地打击了帝国主义的侵略阴谋，宣扬了和平政策。尤其值得提出的，去年在制止帝国主义侵略埃及，在帮助匈牙利战胜反革命复辟方面，苏联都起了决定性的作用。最近，对于美帝国主义阴谋在中东制造紧张局势，唆使土耳其发动侵略叙利亚的战争，苏联义正词严地发出警告，它再一次表明苏联是人类正义和平的保卫者，它将有力地挫败帝国主义对阿拉伯国家的侵略，大大鼓舞这些国家反对殖民主义的决心。
    十月社会主义革命给我国革命事业指出了正确的通往胜利的道路。正如毛主席所说：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义”。从这以后，中国革命的面貌就为之一新。正是由于有了十月革命影响下建立起来的中国共产党，有了共产党的坚强领导，中国的革命才在长期艰苦斗争之后取得了光辉的胜利。也正是由于这样的原故，中国人民一贯把自己的革命看作是伟大的十月社会主义革命的继续，并且以此作为莫大的光荣。
    苏联对于新中国建设事业的帮助是举世皆知的。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，苏联即不断地给予我们以全面的和无私的援助。八年来，根据中苏友好同盟互助条约和其他有关协定，苏联通过优惠贷款、发展贸易、帮助设计企业、供应成套的设备和技术资料、派遣专家和科学技术文化合作等方式，帮助我国迅速地恢复了国民经济，发展了社会主义建设。特别值得提出的，苏联帮助我国建设的二百一十一项重要企业，特别是在第一个五年计划期间苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六项企业，对于实现我国的社会主义工业化更具有极大的意义。同时，根据中苏科学技术合作协定，苏联在科学技术方面尤其是和平利用原子能的研究工作方面还要给予我们以大力的帮助，这就将使我国能在较短的时期内摆脱科学技术上的落后状态。总之，在我国各项建设事业中间都得到了苏联的经验指导和技术帮助，我们的每项成就都渗透着苏联同志的心血。对于苏联人民这样崇高的国际主义精神，我们将永志不忘。
    今天，摆在我们每个人面前的一项崇高义务，就是保卫十月革命的光辉道路，进一步巩固和发展中苏友谊。苏联四十年的经验和我国革命和建设经验都证明：十月革命不仅是苏联无产阶级走向社会主义的康庄大道，也是全世界无产阶级现在和将来走向社会主义的共同的康庄大道。走这条道路，就必然胜利，必然得到永恒的自由和幸福；离开这条道路，就永远摆脱不了被剥削被奴役的境地。因此，我们必须始终不渝地走十月革命的道路，创造性地学习苏联革命和建设的基本经验。只有这样，我们的社会主义以至于共产主义才有实现的保证。另一方面，我们必须极力保卫中苏友谊，并且继续巩固和发展这一友谊。中苏两国的巩固同盟是维护世界和平和促进人类进步的强大支柱，它不但符合中苏两国人民的最高利益，而且也符合世界人民的最高利益。前些时期，我国资产阶级右派，乘着共产党整风的机会，对党和社会主义事业发动了猖狂的进攻。他们反党、反社会主义的重要手法，就是攻击马列主义，诋毁苏联，否定十月革命四十年来苏联和国际共产主义运动的基本经验。他们真实的目的，就是企图借此使我们离开马列主义和十月革命的道路，改变社会主义制度，从而实现资产阶级的复辟。显然，对于这样恶毒的阴谋，我们万难容忍，必须彻底予以粉碎。而这就要继续深入反右派斗争，坚持马列主义，反对修正主义和教条主义，从而实现在政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的彻底胜利。
    十月社会主义革命以来的四十年是马克思列宁主义思想、共产主义思想胜利的四十年。在这四十年中，世界的面貌发生了根本的变化。今天，社会主义阵营的力量日益壮大，殖民体系日益解体，社会主义制度和共产主义思想日益深入人心，十月社会主义革命的光辉照耀着全人类。在最近十二年当中，有十三亿以上的人民从殖民地附庸地位解放出来。目前世界各国的共产党员总数已超过三千三百万人，十三个社会主义国家的共产党已经成为执政党。这些都进一步证实了资本主义死亡的不可避免和日益临近，社会主义将在世界范围内确立，人类全部解放的理想逐渐接近。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    马克思列宁主义万岁！
    中苏两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
