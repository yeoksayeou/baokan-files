    The Worker-Peasant Alliance is the Decisive Force for Socialist Victory
    —Commemorating the Fortieth Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Guan Feng
    The victory of the October Socialist Revolution, in all basic aspects, indicated to the world's proletariat the path to complete liberation and to the thorough liberation of the working peasants under the leadership of the proletariat.
      One of the universal experiences that the October Revolution gave to the world is that it is necessary to unite the laboring peasants around the working class and form a solid worker-peasant alliance led by the working class to attack the capitalist system; the worker-peasant alliance is the decisive force for the victorious completion of the socialist revolution. The October Revolution made it clear that in order for the proletariat to liberate itself, it must thoroughly liberate its peasant brothers; it is the sacred duty of the proletariat to lead and help the cause of the liberation of the laboring peasants. Therefore, the October Socialist Revolution was also a clarion call for the oppressed and exploited peasants; it called on the laboring peasants to stand under the banner of socialism under the leadership of their true leader—the proletariat—and to fight for their true, greatest, and permanent interests.
    The Chinese Communists faithfully applied Lenin's theory of the worker-peasant alliance under the specific conditions of their own country. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out very early on: "The poor and middle peasants can only be liberated under the leadership of the proletariat; and the proletariat can only lead the revolution to victory by forming a solid alliance with the poor and middle peasants; otherwise, it is impossible." The Chinese Communist Party, in the two stages of the revolution (the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution), formulated correct policies toward the poor and middle peasants in accordance with Lenin's principles and the example of the October Revolution, and formed a solid alliance with the poor and middle peasants. The victory of the Chinese revolution is another victory for the Marxist-Leninist theory of the worker-peasant alliance.
    Lenin's theory of the worker-peasant alliance is permeated with a fundamental idea: to believe in the revolutionary nature of the laboring peasants, who are the proletariat's reliable and permanent allies, who can not only become an important force in the democratic revolution under the leadership of the proletariat, but also participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction under the leadership of the proletariat; to believe in the proletariat's ability to lead the laboring peasants, who can not only unite the laboring peasants around themselves and lead them in a thorough democratic revolution, but also continue to unite the laboring peasants around themselves in the socialist revolution and lead them in the socialist revolution.
    Lenin extremely profoundly demonstrated the theory that the proletariat can become the leader of the bourgeois democratic revolution under modern historical conditions. Lenin defined the party's strategic line in the democratic revolution stage as: "The proletariat must carry the democratic revolution to the end, which requires uniting the peasant masses to its side in order to forcibly break the resistance of the autocratic system and paralyze the instability of the bourgeoisie." ("Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution") This line is the line of the proletariat fighting the bourgeoisie for leadership, establishing a solid democratic revolutionary alliance with the peasants, and the line of the proletariat leading the peasants to achieve the most thorough democratic revolution; therefore, it is also the line of creating conditions to immediately transform into a socialist revolution after the victory of the democratic revolution.
    Lenin's "theory of revolutionary transformation" and the strategic plan of the worker-peasant alliance pointed the way for the proletariat and the laboring peasants. In Russia, it was precisely the democratic revolutionary struggle led by the proletariat that overthrew the Tsarist regime and prepared all the conditions for the October Socialist Revolution.
    Due to historical conditions, after the February Revolution in Russia, power fell into the hands of the bourgeoisie. "Political power is the fundamental issue of the revolution." Although the bourgeois regime produced by the February Revolution did not and could not abolish the feudal system, the democratic revolution was completed; the proletariat should immediately begin the socialist revolution, seize power, and complete the tasks left over from the democratic revolution incidentally in the socialist revolution. This is how Lenin dialectically dealt with the relationship between the two revolutionary stages. Thus, under Lenin's leadership, the October Socialist Revolution was launched.
    At that time, the conditions for the proletariat to seize power in Russia were fully ripe; however, opportunists such as Kamenev and Zinoviev opposed the proletariat seizing power. They said: The proletariat only accounts for a minority of the population, and it cannot win if it seizes power, and it cannot consolidate even if it wins. Lenin smashed this fallacy. Although the proletariat accounts for a minority of the population, adding the semi-proletariat in the countryside—the poor peasants—is the majority; the objective conditions are ripe, so why can't the proletariat unite with the poor peasants to seize power? The proletarian regime can gain the support of the laboring peasants, so why can't it be consolidated? The opportunists did not dare to seize victory precisely because they did not believe in the revolutionary nature of the basic masses of peasants. The Bolsheviks, in accordance with Lenin's policy and relying on the strength of the worker-peasant alliance, overthrew the bourgeois regime and established the proletarian regime. This regime quickly satisfied the demands of the laboring peasants and gained their support and support. Therefore, it withstood the severe test of foreign armed intervention and domestic war and was consolidated. Although the middle peasants were extremely shaken at the time, and the Soviet Communist Party adopted a policy of neutralizing the middle peasants for a period, when the revolutionary forces overwhelmed the counter-revolutionary forces, the middle peasant masses also turned to the Soviet regime. The victory of the proletariat seizing power and the victory of smashing foreign armed intervention and the armed riots of the White bandits relied on the worker-peasant alliance, this decisive social force.
    The Chinese Communists dealt with the problems of the Chinese revolution in accordance with Lenin's "theory of revolutionary transformation" and the theory of the worker-peasant alliance. Lenin's "theory of revolutionary transformation" illuminated the entire process of the Chinese revolution, as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Only by recognizing the difference between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and at the same time recognizing the connection between the two, can we correctly lead the Chinese revolution."
      Comrade Mao Zedong defined the party's general line in the democratic revolution stage as: "The revolution of the people's masses led by the proletariat against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism." The people's masses mentioned here mainly refer to workers, peasants, and other laboring people. The most decisive significance of this general line is the leadership of the proletariat and the worker-peasant alliance. In the national democratic revolution in Chinese semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, the proletariat also needs to establish a united front with the national bourgeoisie, but the decisive social force for overthrowing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is the worker-peasant alliance; the establishment and consolidation of the proletariat's leadership also depends on the establishment and consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance; implementing the policy of both unity and struggle with the national bourgeoisie, so that the revolution proceeds along a thorough and uncompromising line, and creating the fundamental conditions for transforming into a socialist revolution after the victory of this revolution, still lies in fighting the national bourgeoisie for the peasants and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The Chinese Communist Party has always regarded the peasants (poor and middle peasants) as reliable allies and regarded the worker-peasant alliance as a strategic central issue.
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries, supported by US imperialism, launched a civil war against the Communists and the people. However, the days of their demise were also approaching. At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We must not only defeat Chiang Kai-shek, but also be able to defeat him." Where did the Chinese Communist Party's confidence in seizing power and winning national victory come from? The most important thing lies in the party's long-term leadership of the peasants in the countryside to carry out struggles and form a solid alliance with the poor and middle peasants. The peasant army led by the proletariat defeated the Kuomintang reactionary army supported by US imperialism. As a result, we achieved the victory of the Third Revolutionary Civil War and established a people's democratic regime that is essentially a proletarian dictatorship. The reason why we were able to establish a regime of this nature is also due to the solid worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the proletariat. It was precisely because we were able to unite the broadest masses of peasants around ourselves and gain their support and support that we guaranteed the absolute leadership of the proletariat in state power. In this way, we smoothly turned to the socialist revolution.
    After the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship, it is necessary to further deal with the relationship with the laboring peasants and guide them to gradually embark on the road of socialism. Without solving this problem, there would be no socialist society, and the proletarian dictatorship could not be maintained for a long time. The Soviet Communist Party, under the leadership of Lenin, victoriously completed this task and provided valuable experience to the world.
    In a country where peasants account for the majority of the population, if the proletariat wants to maintain its power (this power is the most important tool for building socialism and completely eliminating capitalism), it must closely unite the laboring peasants around itself, that is, it must rely on the support of the worker-peasant alliance, this social force. Lenin believed that maintaining the worker-peasant alliance is the supreme principle of the proletarian dictatorship, "Without an alliance with the peasants, there can be no proletarian power, and it is impossible to maintain this power." ("The Tactics of the Russian Communist Party (B)") However, this alliance is not just any kind of alliance, but must be an alliance led by the working class, gradually transforming the peasants with socialist principles, and completely defeating capitalism. According to Lenin, the worker-peasant alliance in the transitional period is "the proletariat liberating the peasants from bourgeois exploitation, liberating them from bourgeois leadership and influence, and attracting them to its side in order to jointly defeat the exploiters." (Ibid.)
    Peasants, as small private owners, are accustomed to individual operation. And the individual economy produces capitalism every moment. If the peasants are not under the leadership of the proletariat and follow their own ideas, they cannot be completely liberated. Lenin pointed out based on historical analysis: "The general petty bourgeoisie, including the peasants, ... all attempts to handle all economic and political affairs on their own have ended in bankruptcy. Either under the leadership of the proletariat or under the leadership of the capitalists; there is no middle road." ("Speech at the All-Russian Congress of Transport Workers' Representatives") Therefore, if the proletariat gives up leadership and allows the peasants' spontaneous capitalist tendencies to develop freely, it is pushing them to the bourgeoisie to lead and take the capitalist road. In that way, sharp class differentiation will occur in the countryside, with most people going bankrupt and a few getting rich. The result will inevitably be the collapse of the worker-peasant alliance, the loss of a reliable pillar of the proletarian regime, and the overthrow by the bourgeoisie. The right-wing opportunists want the proletariat to give up its leadership in the worker-peasant alliance, and their attempt is to destroy the worker-peasant alliance in order to restore capitalism.
      "Left"-leaning opportunists, on the other hand, destroy the worker-peasant alliance from the "left." They absurdly believe that the peasants are the enemy of the Soviet regime, and it is impossible to establish a worker-peasant alliance led by the proletariat toward socialist goals; therefore, they advocate using the method of expropriating the peasants to "build socialism." Their claim will only make the proletariat detached from its allies, isolated, and facilitate the bourgeoisie to overthrow the proletarian regime. Lenin believed that although the peasants spontaneously tend toward capitalism, under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, the proletariat is fully capable of uniting them around itself and gradually leading them onto the path of socialism. First of all, the fundamental interests of the laboring peasants are consistent with the proletariat. If they take the capitalist road, what they will get is only bankruptcy and poverty; only socialism can completely free them from poverty and exploitation, and what they lose is only the lifestyle and habits of small producers. Secondly, the laboring peasants obtained land and freedom under the leadership of the proletariat and were completely freed from feudal oppression and exploitation; they have political trust in the proletariat. As Lenin said: "We, as the leading Communist Party that first helped the Russian peasants to completely free themselves from the oppression of the landlords and established a truly democratic system for them, can truly gain their full trust." ("Opening Speech at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (B)") Again, and most importantly, the proletariat controls state power, controls the economic lifeline and large industry, and it has the material means to help the peasants improve their economic status and guide them onto the road of socialism. It is precisely on the basis of this analysis that Lenin firmly advocated fighting against the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the peasants on the one hand, and firmly advocated forming a solid alliance with the peasants on the basis of socialism on the other hand.
    As everyone knows, the transitional period is a period of decisive struggle between capitalism and socialism. Who will win in the end, one of the deciding factors is who the laboring peasants follow; that is, whether the proletariat can transform the laboring peasants with socialist principles and completely eliminate the base for the existence and regeneration of capitalism. This is full of sharp and complex class struggles. Lenin stipulated the trinity class line of the party in the process of socialist transformation in the countryside: "Be good at reaching an agreement with the middle peasants, never give up the struggle against the rich peasants for a minute, and only steadily rely on the poor peasants" ("Pitirim Sorokin's Valuable Confession"). The poor peasants are the semi-proletariat in the countryside, and under the leadership of the proletariat, they can become an active force for socialism. The party must rely on them closely and first establish a solid alliance with them. The rich peasants are the bourgeoisie in the countryside, and they are class enemies who must be resolutely打击，战胜它们，消灭这个阶级。The most complicated problem is how to treat the middle peasants. After the Soviet Union implemented the "Land Decree," the countryside became middle peasant-ized, and the middle peasants became the majority of the rural population. Lenin pointed out at the time that the middle peasants "as laborers, as people who live by their own labor, as people who have been oppressed by capitalism, such peasants stand on the side of the workers. But the peasant who holds surplus grain, who is accustomed to regarding surplus grain as his private property that he can freely sell. And selling surplus grain in a hungry country becomes a speculator, an exploiter..." ("Speech at the First All-Russian Party's Rural Work Conference") That is to say, the middle peasant is a vacillating, dualistic class; on the one hand, they can accept socialism, and on the other hand, they, especially the more affluent stratum among them, are representatives of the spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside, demanding individual operation to get rich. Therefore, the fundamental issue in the struggle between the two roads in the countryside lies in fighting the rich peasants for the middle peasants. Of course, there must also be a struggle against the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the middle peasants, but this is a struggle within the laboring people and must never be regarded as the same as the rich peasants. Lenin repeatedly pointed this out, "The middle peasant is not our enemy. He vacillated in the past, he vacillates now, and he will vacillate in the future; the task of influencing those who vacillate is different from the task of overthrowing the exploiters and defeating active enemies." ("Pitirim Sorokin's Valuable Confession") In order to prevent the vacillators from vacillating, to make them get rid of the direction of capitalism and firmly take the road of socialism, the main thing is to adopt the methods of persuasion and education, to rely on the "power of demonstration," and sometimes even need to make some necessary concessions to them, patiently win their trust, of course, this concession must also be for the development of socialist economic undertakings and to facilitate the socialist transformation of agriculture. In short, for the middle peasants, we must unite them in order to transform them; at the same time, we must gradually transform them in order to consolidate our unity with them and finally completely defeat capitalism in the countryside.
    To completely defeat capitalism in the countryside and eliminate the base for the existence and regeneration of capitalism is to transform the individual small peasant economy into a socialist collective agricultural economy and transform the individual peasants into collective peasants. The most decisive condition for carrying out this transformation is that the proletarian state controls large industries and continuously gives priority to the development of large industries; because socialist large industries can provide the material and technical basis for transforming small production. Lenin, based on the principles of Marx and Engels, found a transitional method and an appropriate form of transition to lead the laboring peasants onto the road of socialism and transform small production in the practice of building socialism in the Soviet Union. As early as shortly after the October Revolution, Lenin especially proposed the issue of organizing communes, believing that collective farming was the only way out for poor peasants. Later, he formulated a complete cooperative plan. That is, to attract peasants to participate in socialist construction through cooperatives and gradually instill collective principles into the sales of agricultural products and the production of agricultural products. This is an easy-to-accept and understand method for peasants.
    After Lenin's death, the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, headed by Stalin, defended Lenin's theory of the worker-peasant alliance, smashed the attacks of "left" and right opportunism, and led the Soviet people to carry out arduous struggles in accordance with the cooperative road planned by Lenin, completely completed the collectivization of agriculture, eliminated the rich peasant class, and armed agriculture with modern agricultural machinery on the basis of collectivization.
    After the Soviet Union achieved agricultural collectivization in 1934, its unparalleled superiority was demonstrated in a very short period. Soviet grain output was 4.266 billion poods in 1933 and reached 7.344 billion poods in 1937. Cotton output was 77.6 million poods in 1932 and reached 157.6 million poods in 1937, an increase of more than double. The lives of collective farmers have been greatly improved on the basis of production development. The average consumption of collective farmers per capita in terms of meat, fish, fat, sugar, and confectionery increased more than double in the four years from 1933 to 1937. At this time, the rural education network and cultural network were also established.
    The victory of the Soviet collective farm system has great international significance. The fact that the Soviet laboring peasants completely got rid of exploitation and poverty under the leadership of the working class on the road of the October Revolution is a great encouragement to the revolutions of all countries in the world and to the exploited laboring peasants of all countries.
    The Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with Lenin's instructions and the road victoriously taken by the Soviet Union, led the socialist transformation of agriculture. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We must believe that: (1) The broad masses of peasants are willing to gradually embark on the road of socialism under the leadership of the party; (2) The party is able to lead the peasants onto the road of socialism. These two points are the essence and mainstream of things." And this is precisely the most fundamental thing in Lenin's theory of the worker-peasant alliance in the transitional period.
    Comrade Mao Zedong, based on China's situation, summed up the experience of our party's long-term leadership of agricultural production in the rural base areas, and created a concrete road of transition from mutual aid teams (collective labor on the basis of individual economy) with socialist sprouts to semi-socialist cooperatives (land shares, unified management), and then to fully socialist advanced cooperatives. He also divided the lower-middle peasants and used them together with the poor peasants as the force the party relied on in the countryside in the process of establishing and consolidating cooperatives. This is because China has a large population and little land, and the lower-middle peasants originally had a weak family background and lacked agricultural tools and livestock, so they had a positive desire for cooperativization. Since the lower-middle peasants are one of the forces that can be relied on, the masses the party relies on in the countryside have become the majority. Organizing the poor and lower-middle peasants who are willing to participate in the cooperatives and running the cooperatives well, it will not be difficult to fight against the spontaneous capitalist forces of the well-to-do middle peasants and persuade and attract them.
    The high tide of agricultural cooperativization in our country appeared in the second half of 1955 after a long period of preparation. Thanks to the timely pointing out by the Party Central Committee of the arrival of the high tide and the correct policy of leading this high tide, agricultural cooperativization was quickly completed and the individual economic system in the countryside was basically eliminated. This is a major victory. But the struggle between the two roads in the countryside is not over. Now, socialist education and great debate are being carried out in the countryside, which is a continuation of the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. We must continue to implement the party's class line in the countryside and carry out a series of political work, ideological work, and economic work to constantly overcome the vacillation of some well-to-do middle peasants, consolidate all the cooperatives, and gradually achieve the complete victory of socialism over capitalism in the countryside.
    The Soviet Union has built a socialist society in the mid-1930s. The completion of socialist society means that the alliance between the working class and the laboring peasants has developed to a new and higher stage. This alliance has become an alliance of the working class and all the collective farmers; this alliance is more consolidated, stronger, and is an alliance that bears the new great task of gradually transitioning from socialism to communism.
    As everyone knows, under the socialist system, there are still major differences between industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas; the main manifestation is the existence of two forms of socialist ownership: in industry (and state farms) is the ownership by the whole people of the means of production and products (which plays a leading role in the development of social production), and in agriculture, the collective, collective farm ownership occupies the main position. The relationship between workers and collective farmers is also the issue of the relationship between the state and collective farms, the relationship between urban and rural areas, and the relationship between the economy of ownership by the whole people and the collective farm economy. The purpose of the worker-peasant alliance at this time is to consolidate the production links between the two parts of the socialist economy (state-owned and collective farms), strengthen urban assistance to the countryside, consolidate the unity between the working class and the collective farmers as two spiritually and politically consistent classes, and strive for a gradual transition to communism.
    The Soviet Communist Party has always unswervingly faithfully implemented the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and the principle of the worker-peasant alliance. The industrial and agricultural economy of the Soviet Union has been rising continuously, developing forward at an unprecedented speed in the world. The anti-fascist war tested this country, and its strength was incomparably strong; it tested its people, and the workers and collective farmers were completely united.
    After World War II, the Soviet people quickly healed the wounds of war and continued to move towards communism. The 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party and the Sixth Five-Year Plan marked a major step towards a breakthrough to communism.
    From 1954 to 1956, the Soviet Union implemented a series of major measures in accelerating the improvement of agriculture. In terms of expanding the cultivated area, the Soviet Union has made great achievements, having reclaimed 35.9 million hectares of virgin and fallow land in the past three years. Due to the reclamation of virgin and fallow land, the state received an additional 1 billion poods of commercial grain in 1956, and the output of livestock feed also greatly increased. The Soviet Party and government also passed resolutions on sending leading cadres and professional cadres to strengthen collective farms and machine tractor stations, implementing a new planning system in agriculture, raising the procurement and purchase prices of agricultural products, and allowing collective farm members to pre-draw funds every month. These measures are of great significance for developing agricultural production, strengthening rural construction, and continuously consolidating the alliance between workers and collective farmers.
    The Soviet Communist Party, based on the achievements and experience of advanced collective farms, put forward a resounding call to socialist agricultural workers: to catch up with the United States in the output of milk, butter, and meat per capita in the next few years. This call aroused a new upsurge of creative activities among the vast number of agricultural workers. Animal husbandry on collective farms and state farms has grown rapidly. This slogan and its realization will also have a profound impact on the working people all over the world—whether in socialist or capitalist countries.
    The Soviet Communist Party has led the Soviet laboring people forward on the road of the October Revolution for forty years. Its experience is the richest. It not only provides rich experience in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and transforming agriculture with socialist principles; but also provides and is providing valuable experience in continuing to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and relying on the strength of the worker-peasant alliance to build communism after the construction of a socialist society.

    工农联盟是社会主义胜利的决定力量
    ——纪念十月革命四十周年
    关锋
    十月社会主义革命的胜利，在一切基本方面指示了全世界无产阶级彻底的解放和劳动农民在无产阶级领导下彻底解放的道路。
      十月革命给予全世界的普遍经验之一，便是：必须把劳动农民团结在工人阶级的周围，结成工人阶级领导的巩固的工农联盟，向资本主义制度进攻；工农联盟是胜利完成社会主义革命的决定力量。十月革命使人看到，无产阶级为要使自己得到解放，就必须使农民弟兄得到彻底解放；领导和帮助劳动农民的解放事业，是无产阶级的天职。因此，十月社会主义革命，对于被压迫被剥削的农民说来，也是响彻云霄的号角；它号召劳动农民在自己的真正领袖——无产阶级领导之下，站到社会主义旗帜之下，为自己真正的最大的永久的利益而斗争。
    中国共产党人，忠实地在本国具体条件下运用了列宁的工农联盟学说。毛泽东同志在很早以前就指出：“贫农和中农都只有在无产阶级的领导之下，才能得到解放；而无产阶级也只有和贫农、中农结成坚固的联盟，才能领导革命到达胜利，否则是不可能的。”中国共产党，在革命的两个阶段上（民主革命和社会主义革命），按照列宁的原则和十月革命的榜样，制定了对贫农和中农的正确政策，同贫农和中农结成了巩固的联盟。中国革命的胜利是马克思列宁主义的工农联盟学说的又一次的胜利。
    列宁的工农联盟学说中贯串着一个根本思想，就是：相信劳动农民的革命性，它是无产阶级可靠的永久的同盟军，不但能在无产阶级的领导下成为民主革命的重要力量，而且能在无产阶级的领导下参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设；相信无产阶级对于劳动农民的领导能力，它不但能够把劳动农民团结在自己的周围，领导他们进行彻底的民主革命，而且能够在社会主义革命中继续把劳动农民团结在自己的周围，领导他们进行社会主义革命。
    列宁极其深刻地论证了在现代历史条件下无产阶级能够成为资产阶级民主革命的领导者的理论。列宁把党在民主革命阶段的战略路线规定为：“无产阶级应当把民主革命进行到底，这就要把农民群众联合到自己的方面来，以便用强力打破专制制度的反抗，并麻痹资产阶级的不稳定性。”（“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”）这条路线就是无产阶级向资产阶级争夺领导权、和农民建立巩固的民主革命联盟的路线，就是无产阶级领导农民实现最彻底的民主革命的路线；因而也就是创造条件，在民主革命胜利之后立刻转变为社会主义革命的路线。
    列宁的“革命转变论”和工农联盟的战略计划，给无产阶级和劳动农民指明了道路。在俄国，正是无产阶级领导农民进行的民主革命斗争推倒了沙皇政权，并为十月社会主义革命准备了一切条件。
    由于历史条件的关系，俄国的二月革命后，政权落在了资产阶级的手里。“政权是革命的根本问题”，虽然二月革命产生的资产阶级政权没有也不可能废除封建制度，但是民主革命却完结了；无产阶级应该立刻开始社会主义革命，夺取政权，把民主革命遗留下的任务放在社会主义革命中附带地去完成。列宁就是这样辩证地处理两个革命阶段的关系的。于是在列宁的领导下发动了十月社会主义革命。
    当时，在俄国实行无产阶级革命夺取政权的条件已经充分成熟了；但是，加米涅夫、季诺维也夫等机会主义分子，却反对无产阶级去夺取政权。他们说：无产阶级只占人口的少数，夺取政权是不能胜利的，胜利了也不能巩固。列宁粉碎了这种谬论。无产阶级虽然占人口的少数，但是加上农村的半无产阶级——贫农，却是大多数；客观条件成熟了，无产阶级为什么不能够联合贫农起来夺取政权呢？无产阶级政权可以取得劳动农民的拥护，为什么不能巩固呢？机会主义者们，正是由于不相信农民基本群众的革命性，而不敢夺取胜利的。布尔什维克按照列宁的方针，依靠工农联盟的力量，推翻了资产阶级政权，建立了无产阶级政权。这个政权，很快地满足了劳动农民的要求，取得了他们的拥护和支持。因此，它经受住了外国武装干涉和国内战争的严重考验，而巩固了起来。虽然，当时的中农极其动摇，苏联共产党在一个时期内采取了中立中农的政策，但是当革命力量压倒了反革命力量的时候，中农群众也就转到苏维埃政权方面来了。无产阶级夺取政权的胜利，粉碎外国武装干涉和白匪武装暴乱的胜利，便是依靠了工农联盟这个决定性的社会力量。
    中国共产党人，就是按照列宁的“革命转变论”和工农联盟学说，来处理中国革命问题的。列宁的“革命转变论”，照亮了中国革命的全部进程，正如毛泽东同志所说：“只有认清民主主义革命和社会主义革命的区别，同时又认清二者的联系，才能正确地领导中国革命。”
      毛泽东同志把民主革命阶段的党的总路线规定为：“无产阶级领导的人民大众的反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命”。这里所说的人民大众，主要的就是工人和农民及其他劳动人民。这条总路线最有决定意义的就是无产阶级的领导权和工农联盟。在中国半封建半殖民地社会里的民族民主革命中，无产阶级还需要和民族资产阶级建立统一战线，但是，打倒帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的决定性的社会力量是工农联盟；无产阶级的领导权的建立和巩固，也决定于建立和巩固工农联盟；实行和民族资产阶级又团结、又斗争的政策，使革命按照彻底的不妥协的路线进行，并创造在这个革命胜利之后转变为社会主义革命的根本条件，也还是在于和民族资产阶级争夺农民，巩固工农联盟。中国共产党，一向把农民（贫农和中农）看作可靠的同盟军，把工农联盟问题当作战略的中心问题。
    在抗日战争胜利以后，蒋介石国民党反动派在美帝国主义的支持下，发动了反共反人民的内战。然而，他们灭亡的日子也就到了。当时毛泽东同志说：“我们不但必须打败蒋介石，而且能够打败他。”中国共产党敢于夺取政权、夺取全国胜利的信心在哪里？最主要的就在于党长期在农村中领导农民进行斗争，同贫农和中农结成了巩固的联盟。无产阶级领导下的农民大军战胜了美帝国主义支持的国民党反动军队。结果，我们取得了第三次国内革命战争的胜利，建立了实质上是无产阶级专政的人民民主政权。所以能够建立这样性质的政权，也还是在于无产阶级领导下的牢固的工农联盟。正是因为能够把最广大的农民团结在自己的周围，取得了他们的拥护和支持，才保证了无产阶级在国家政权中的绝对领导权。这样，就顺利地转向了社会主义革命。
    无产阶级专政建立之后，必须进一步处理和劳动农民的关系，引导他们逐步走上社会主义的道路。不解决这个问题，就没有社会主义社会，无产阶级专政也不能长期保持下去。苏联共产党在列宁的领导下，胜利地完成了这个任务，给全世界提供了宝贵的经验。
    在一个农民占人口多数的国家里，无产阶级要想保住自己的政权（这个政权是建设社会主义、彻底消灭资本主义的最主要的工具），必须把劳动农民紧密地团结在自己的周围，即：必须依靠工农联盟这个社会力量的支持。列宁认为：维护工农联盟是无产阶级专政的最高原则，“不跟农民结成联盟，就不可能有无产阶级的政权，就不可能保持住这种政权。”（“俄国共产党（布）底策略”）但是，这个联盟，并不是随便的一种联盟，而必须是工人阶级领导的联盟、以社会主义原则逐步改造农民、彻底战胜资本主义的联盟。按照列宁的说法，过渡时期的工农联盟，乃是“无产阶级把农民从资产阶级剥削下解放出来，把他们从资产阶级的领导与影响下解放出来，把他们吸引到自己方面来，以便共同战胜剥削者”。（同上）
    农民，作为小私有者，是习惯于个体经营的。而个体经济每时每刻地产生着资本主义。农民如果不在无产阶级领导之下，按照他们自己的想法走，是不能得到彻底解放的。列宁根据历史的分析指出：“一般小资产阶级，其中包括有农民，……自行处理经济和政治的一切企图，都终于遭到了破产。或者在无产阶级领导下，或者在资本家领导下；中间道路是没有的。”（“在全俄运输工人代表大会上的演说”）所以无产阶级如果放弃领导，让农民的资本主义自发倾向自由发展，就是把他们推给资产阶级去领导，走资本主义的道路。那样，农村就会发生急剧的阶级分化，大多数人破产，少数人发财。其结果必然是工农联盟瓦解，无产阶级政权失去可靠的支柱，而被资产阶级推翻。右倾机会主义者要无产阶级放弃在工农联盟中的领导权，他们的企图就是破坏工农联盟，以便资本主义复辟。
      “左”倾机会主义者则从“左”的方面破坏工农联盟。他们荒谬地认为，农民是苏维埃政权的敌人，建立无产阶级领导的向社会主义目标前进的工农联盟是不可能的；因此，他们主张用剥夺农民的办法去“建设社会主义”。他们的这种主张，只会是使无产阶级脱离自己的同盟军，孤立起来，而便于资产阶级推翻无产阶级政权。列宁认为，农民虽然自发地趋向资本主义，但是在无产阶级专政的条件下，无产阶级完全有可能把他们团结在自己的周围，把他们逐步引上社会主义的道路。首先，劳动农民的根本利益和无产阶级是一致的。如果他们走资本主义的道路，获得的只能是破产和贫困；只有社会主义才能使他们彻底摆脱贫困和剥削，所失去的只是小生产者的生活方式和习惯。其次，劳动农民是在无产阶级领导下获得土地和自由，彻底摆脱了封建压迫和剥削的；他们对无产阶级有着政治信任。如列宁所说：“我们，作为第一次帮助俄国农民彻底摆脱了地主压迫并为他们建立起真正民主制度的、居于领导地位的共产党，就能真正得到他们的充分信任。”（“俄共（布）第八次代表大会开幕词”）再次，也是最重要的，就是无产阶级掌握国家政权，掌握着经济命脉和大工业，它握有帮助农民改善经济地位，引导他们走上社会主义道路的物质手段。正是建筑在这种分析的基础上，所以列宁一方面坚决主张和农民的自发资本主义趋势作斗争，一方面又坚决主张和农民结成在社会主义基础上的巩固的联盟。
    大家知道：过渡时期是资本主义和社会主义两条道路决死斗争的时期。究竟谁战胜谁，决定问题之一就是看劳动农民跟着谁走；也就是说无产阶级能不能以社会主义原则改造劳动农民、彻底消灭资本主义存在和再生的基地。这其中充满着尖锐和复杂的阶级斗争。列宁规定了社会主义改造过程中党在农村的三位一体的阶级路线：“要善于同中农成立协议，一分钟也不放弃同富农的斗争，并且只是稳稳地依靠贫农”（“皮梯利姆·索罗金的宝贵自供”）。贫农是农村的半无产阶级，他们能在无产阶级领导下，成为社会主义的积极力量。党必须紧紧地依靠他们，首先和他们建立巩固的联盟。富农是农村的资产阶级，是阶级敌人，必须予以坚决的打击，战胜它们，消灭这个阶级。最复杂的问题是对待中农的问题。苏联在实现了“土地法令”之后，农村已经中农化了，中农成了农村人口的多数。列宁当时指出，中农“作为劳动者、作为靠自己劳动过活的人，作为受过资本主义压迫的人，这样的农民是站在工人方面的。但是握有余粮的私有者农民，习惯于把余粮看成他可以自由出售的私产。而在饥饿的国家里出卖余粮，这就变成投机者，变成剥削者……。”（“在第一次全俄党的农村工作会议上的演说”）这就是说，中农是一个动摇的、具有两重性的阶层；他们一方面是能够接受社会主义的，一方面，他们，特别是他们中的比较富裕的阶层，是农村资本主义自发势力、要求个体经营发家致富的代表者。所以，农村两条道路的斗争，根本问题在于和富农争夺中农。对中农的资本主义自发倾向当然也要有斗争，然而这是劳动人民内部的斗争，决不可把他们和富农一样看待。列宁屡次指出这一点，“中农不是我们的敌人。他过去动摇，现在动摇，将来还会动摇；影响动摇者的任务同推翻剥削者和战胜积极敌人的任务是不一样的。”（“皮梯利姆·索罗金的宝贵自供”）为了使动摇者不动摇，使他们摆脱资本主义的方向而坚定地走社会主义的道路，主要的是要采取说服、教育的方法，要靠“示范的力量”，甚至有时还需要向他们做一些必要的让步，耐心地争取他们的信任，当然这种让步也必须是为了发展社会主义经济事业、为了便利于进行农业的社会主义改造。总之，对于中农，必须团结他们才能改造他们；同时必须逐步地改造他们，才能巩固和他们的团结，最后在农村彻底战胜资本主义。
    在农村中彻底战胜资本主义、消灭资本主义存在和再生的基地，就是把个体小农经济改造成为社会主义的集体农业经济，把个体农民改造成为集体农民。实行这种改造的最有决定意义的条件，就是无产阶级国家掌握着大工业，不断地优先发展大工业；因为社会主义大工业能够提供改造小生产的物质基础和技术基础。列宁根据马克思和恩格斯的原则指示，在苏联建设社会主义的实践中，找到了把劳动农民引上社会主义道路、改造小生产的过渡办法、过渡的恰当形式。还在十月革命不久以后，列宁就特别提出了组织共耕社的问题，认为共同耕作是贫苦农民的唯一出路。后来又制定了完整的合作社计划。这就是，经过合作社来吸引农民参加社会主义建设，将集体原则逐渐灌输于农产品销售方面和农产品生产方面。对于农民说来这是容易接受和了解的办法。
    在列宁逝世之后，以斯大林为首的苏共中央，保卫了列宁的工农联盟学说，粉碎了“左”右机会主义的进攻，按照列宁所策划的合作化道路，领导苏联人民进行了艰巨的斗争，彻底完成了农业集体化，消灭了富农阶级，并在集体化基础上以现代农业机器武装了农业。
    苏联在1934年实现了农业集体化以后，在很短的时期内，就显示了它的无比的优越性。苏联谷物产量，在1933年为四十二亿六千六百万普特，到1937年就达到了七十三亿四千四百万普特。棉花产量在1932年为七千七百六十万普特，1937年
  就达到了一亿五千七百六十万普特，增加了一倍多。集体农民的生活在生产发展的基础上大大地改善了。集体农民，平均每人在肉、鱼、脂肪、糖、糖果点心这类食品方面的消费量，从1933年到1937年四年间增加了一倍多。这时农村的教育网和文化网也建立起来了。
    苏联集体农庄制度的胜利，具有重大的国际意义。苏联劳动农民在十月革命的道路上，在工人阶级领导下彻底摆脱剥削和贫困的事实，对于世界各国的革命、对于各国被剥削的劳动农民，都是一个极大的鼓舞。
    中国共产党是按照列宁的指示和苏联胜利走过的道路，领导农业的社会主义改造的。毛泽东同志说：“我们必须相信：（1）广大农民是愿意在党的领导下逐步地走上社会主义道路的；（2）党是能够领导农民走上社会主义道路的。这两点是事物的本质和主流。”而这也正是列宁的过渡时期工农联盟学说中的最根本的东西。
    毛泽东同志根据中国的情况，总结了我党在农村根据地长期领导农业生产的经验，创造了由社会主义萌芽的互助组（在个体经济基础上的集体劳动）到半社会主义的合作社（土地入股、统一经营）、再到完全社会主义的高级合作社这样一条过渡的具体道路。他还把下中农划分出来，与贫农一起作为在建立和巩固合作社过程中党在农村依靠的力量。这是因为中国人口多、土地少，下中农原来家底薄、缺乏农具和牲畜，因而他们有要求合作化的积极性。由于下中农是可以依靠的力量之一，党在农村依靠的群众就成了大多数。把愿意参加合作社的贫农和下中农组织起来，并把社办好，这样和富裕中农的自发资本主义势力作斗争，说服和吸引他们，就不困难了。
    我国农业合作化高潮，是经过了长期准备于1955年下半年出现的。由于党中央及时指出高潮的到来和领导这个高潮的正确方针，所以很快地完成了农业合作化，基本上消灭了农村的个体经济制度。这是一个重大胜利。但是农村的两条道路的斗争并没有结束。现在，农村正在展开社会主义教育和大辩论，这是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的继续，我们必须继续贯彻党在农村的阶级路线，进行一系列的政治工作、思想工作和经济工作，不断地克服一部分富裕中农的动摇，把合作社全部巩固起来，逐步地取得社会主义在农村中对于资本主义的完全胜利。
    苏联已经在三十年代中叶建成了社会主义社会。社会主义社会的建成，意味着工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟发展到了新的高级的阶段。这一联盟已经成为工人阶级和全体集体农民的联盟；这个联盟是更加巩固、更加强大，并且是担负着从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义这样一个新的伟大任务的联盟了。
    大家知道，在社会主义制度下，工业和农业、城市和乡村还存在着重大差别；其主要表现就是存在着两种形式的社会主义所有制：在工业中（以及国营农场）是生产资料和产品的全民所有制（它在社会生产的发展中起着主导作用），在农业中占主要地位的却是集团的、集体农庄所有制。工人和集体农民的关系，也就是国家和集体农庄的关系问题，城市和乡村、全民所有制的经济和集体农庄经济的关系问题。这时候的工农联盟，目的就在于巩固社会主义经济两个部分（国家的和集体农庄的）之间的生产联系，加强城市对乡村的援助，巩固工人和集体农民这样两个精神上政治上一致的阶级之间的团结，为逐步过渡到共产主义而斗争。
    苏联共产党始终不渝地忠实执行着优先发展重工业的方针和工农联盟的原则。苏联的工业和农业经济不断高涨，以全世界史无前例的速度向前发展着。反法西斯战争，考验了这个国家，它的力量是无比强大的；考验了它的人民，工人和集体农民是完全团结一致的。
    在第二次世界大战以后，苏联人民迅速医治了战争的创伤，并继续向共产主义迈进。苏共二十次代表大会和第六个五年计划，标志着向共产主义突进的重大步骤。
    从1954—1956年间，苏联在加速提高农业方面实行了一系列的重大措施。在扩大耕地面积方面，苏联已经取得了巨大成绩，三年来已经开垦了三千五百九十万公顷生荒地和熟荒地。由于开垦生荒地和熟荒地，在1956年国家就额外收到十亿多普特商品粮食，畜牧业饲料产量也大大地增加了。苏联党和政府还通过了派遣领导干部和专业干部去加强集体农庄和机器拖拉机站、在农业中实行新的计划工作制度、提高农产品的征购和收购价格、集体农庄庄员每月可以预支款项等决议。这些措施，对于发展农业生产、加强农村建设，和不断地巩固工人和集体农民的联盟，都有很重大的意义。
    苏联共产党，根据先进集体农庄的成就和经验，向社会主义农业劳动者，提出响亮的号召：在最近几年内在按人口计算的牛奶、油脂、肉类的产量方面赶上美国。这一号召在广大的农业劳动者中引起了创造性活动的新高潮。集体农庄和国营农场的畜牧业得到了急剧的增长。这个口号及其实现，也一定能够对全世界——无论是社会主义国家还是资本主义国家的劳动人民，发生深刻的影响。
    苏联共产党领导苏联劳动人民在十月革命的道路上前进了四十年。它的经验是最丰富的。它不仅提供了巩固工农联盟、以社会主义原则改造农业的丰富经验；而且提供了并且正在提供着在社会主义社会建成以后继续巩固工农联盟、依靠工农联盟的力量建设共产主义的宝贵经验。
