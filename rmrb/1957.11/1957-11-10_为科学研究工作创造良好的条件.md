    To Create Good Conditions for Scientific Research Work
    The State Council's approved plans for coordinating and improving books, materials, instruments, and chemical reagents are important measures to improve the material conditions for scientific research. These four plans will undoubtedly be warmly welcomed by scientists, stimulate their work enthusiasm, and thus promote the development of China's scientific cause.
    Scientific work is a very important part of China's socialist construction. Without advanced science and technology, it is fundamentally impossible to build a modern industry, a modern agriculture, and a modern national defense in our country. Our Party and government have always attached great importance to scientific work. In terms of the conditions for scientific work alone, the country has made great efforts in recent years. Books, materials, instruments, chemical reagents, and other necessities for scientific research have been significantly improved compared with before liberation. Taking the Beijing Library as an example, it currently has 4.7 million volumes, more than three times the number before liberation. The total value of imported scientific instruments increased by 67% in 1956 compared to 1952. The number of chemical reagents operated by commercial departments increased from only 200 in 1950 to more than 4,000 in 1956. The sorting and exchange of data have also been greatly improved. Many scientific research units have the latest scientific instruments and equipment, fundamentally changing the extremely backward state of scientific equipment before liberation.
    However, due to the very weak foundation of scientific work in our country in the past, the conditions for scientific work are far from meeting the needs of the rapid development of scientific research in our country since liberation. For example, in terms of books and materials work, we do not yet have a unified management and use method; some books and materials are still backlogged and have a low utilization rate; in terms of the production and import of instruments and chemical reagents, there is still a lack of overall planning and comprehensive plans. These shortcomings, to a certain extent, hinder the progress of scientific research. During the period of great airing of views and great blooming of thoughts, scientists put forward many opinions in this regard, most of which should be affirmed as correct. This is a difficulty in the advancement of China's socialist construction, and it can be gradually overcome in the work. However, the bourgeois rightists tried their best to use this temporary difficulty, exaggerated the shortcomings in the work, and fiercely attacked the leadership of our Party and government and the socialist system. The anti-communist and anti-socialist scientific program of the Zhang-Luo alliance is their criminal evidence.
    Now people see more clearly, who really cares about scientific research and solves the problem of working conditions for scientists in many ways? Obviously, it is not the reactionary rulers of old China and a small handful of bourgeois rightists, but the Communist Party of China and the People's Government under its leadership. The four plans announced now once again prove such a truth. The future task of all relevant departments and scientific institutions is to resolutely overcome these shortcomings and thoroughly improve our work by rectifying the style of work and implementing these four plans on the basis of the victory of the anti-rightist struggle.
    Of course, solving the problem of scientific working conditions is an extremely complex and detailed task, which involves a wide range of aspects. The fundamental solution to this problem still depends on the development of China's entire economic and cultural undertakings. From the current point of view, to improve these tasks, on the one hand, we must improve production, import, sorting, and publishing work, so that books, materials, instruments, chemical reagents, etc., in terms of quantity and quality, meet the requirements of scientific work as much as possible; on the other hand, we must improve management, supply, and use systems, actively tap potential, and maximize and improve the role of existing institutions, personnel, financial resources, and material resources.
    In order to do the above work well, we must first strengthen organizational work and coordination work. Whether it is the sorting and use of books and materials, or the production and import of instruments and chemical reagents, it should be carried out in an organized, planned, and step-by-step manner under the unified leadership of the state. For example, in the work of books and materials, there is currently such a situation: on the one hand, in the Ministry of Culture system alone, there are more than 10 million books that have not been sorted out and utilized, and many library collections have too many duplicates; on the other hand, some scientific institutions lack such books. Similarly, the data of many departments have not been sorted out and cannot be fully utilized. In terms of instruments and chemical reagents, although the quantity, quality, and variety of production and import have increased and improved significantly in recent years, due to the lack of a unified production, import plan, and supply system, there is still a lack of close cooperation and organic connection between supply and demand departments, and the product specifications lack unified standards. Therefore, some instruments and chemical reagents have been produced, but they do not meet the requirements of the user departments. Sometimes, even because the foreign trade department does not understand the domestic production situation, the things that should be imported are not imported, and the things that should not be imported are imported instead. This not only brings difficulties to scientific research, but also causes undue losses to the state's financial expenditures. Now, the Science Planning Commission has decided to establish four groups for books, materials, instruments, and chemical reagents, specializing in this work. Their future task is to gradually put all the work into the planning track under the principle of overall arrangement and strengthening cooperation, and to overcome the phenomenon of each unit doing its own thing, lacking contact, and not paying attention to coordination.
    Although China's investment in scientific work has been increasing year by year, it will still be difficult to fully meet the needs of scientific work in the longer term. This requires our scientific departments to learn to live frugally and advocate the atmosphere of running science diligently and frugally. When purchasing various equipment, we must carefully calculate and distinguish the priorities and urgency. The practice of lacking focus, blindly setting up stalls, and seeking completeness and bigness in housing and equipment should be resolutely stopped. The original equipment of each scientific department that can be used or can be used after repair should be used as much as possible. Some books, instruments, and equipment that can be used jointly should be used jointly as much as possible; if the unit does not need them temporarily, it should take the initiative to transfer them to other departments for use. When necessary, each unit can also stipulate a temporary cooperation system through consultation to strengthen cooperation, mutual support, and exchange of needed goods to make full use of existing scientific equipment. All scientific departments should further establish a global perspective, proceed from the overall interests of the country, overcome departmentalism, and actively submit to the coordinated work of the unified leadership of the country.
    In order to improve the supply of books, materials, instruments, and chemical reagents, all relevant departments and production and marketing units should further improve their working methods and correct their service attitudes. In terms of books and materials work, we should simplify borrowing procedures and improve the confidentiality system as much as possible. In the supply of instruments and chemical reagents, all relevant departments and production units should take the initiative to strengthen contact with scientific departments and understand their needs; if they can produce and repair them themselves, they should try their best to produce and repair them. Production units should also strengthen contact, exchange information, and exchange production technical experience. This can not only avoid repetitive waste in production, but also improve the production technology of scientific instruments and chemical reagents. At present, some individual competent departments and production units still have the mentality of嫌xián complexity,怕pà trouble, and want to manage as little as possible or shirk responsibility when dealing with this work. This is an irresponsible bureaucratic attitude towards scientific undertakings and must be corrected. We must know that although producing and repairing instruments and producing special chemical reagents is a troublesome thing, it also has great benefits, which can not only save the country's foreign exchange, but also improve China's scientific and technological level. Why not do such a good thing?
    In terms of serving scientific departments, some places have already created very good experience. For example, Tianjin established a scientific work service office, which is specifically responsible for this work. They have a deep understanding of the requirements of scientific departments and the production characteristics of production units, introduce relationships to both parties, and solve many problems in the supply and repair of instruments and chemical reagents for scientific departments. They have a small number of people, but their work is very active and have made some achievements, which have been well received by the scientific community. This practice is worth emulating by cities with more scientific institutions.
    Our scientists have a fine tradition of running science diligently and frugally. In the old China, under extremely difficult scientific working conditions, they worked hard and persisted in scientific research. After liberation, many scientists also personally modified and repaired instruments, transformed old ones into new ones, and saved the country's expenses. Now, the conditions for our scientific work have been greatly improved compared with before liberation. We have the strong leadership and support of the Party and the government, as well as the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. As long as we continue to carry forward this fine tradition, work hard, be simple, and develop China's scientific cause diligently and frugally, we will surely be able to achieve brilliant victories on the scientific front.

    为科学研究工作创造良好的条件
    国务院批准的关于图书、资料、仪器、化学试剂等协调和改进的方案，是改进科学研究工作的物质条件的重要措施。这四个方案无疑地将受到科学家们的热烈欢迎，并且激发他们的工作积极性，从而促进我国科学事业的发展。
    科学工作，是我国社会主义建设事业的一个十分重要的组成部分。没有先进的科学技术，要想在我国建成现代化的工业、现代化的农业和现代化的国防，那是根本不可能的。我们的党和政府向来是很重视科学工作的。单就科学工作条件这方面来说，几年来国家已经作了很大的努力。科学研究工作所必需的图书、资料、仪器、化学试剂等，比解放前有了显著的改善。仅以北京图书馆为例，目前藏书四百七十万册，比解放前增加了两倍以上。进口科学仪器总值，1956年比1952年增加了67％。商业部门所经营的化学试剂，1950年只有二百种，1956年就增加到四千多种。资料的整理和交流情况也大有改进。许多科学研究单位，已经拥有最新式的科学仪器设备，根本地改变了解放前在科学设备上的极端落后状态。
    但是，由于过去我国科学工作基础十分薄弱，因此，在科学工作条件方面，远远地跟不上解放以来我国科学研究迅速发展的要求。例如，在图书、资料工作方面，我们还没有一套统一管理、统一使用的办法；部分图书、资料还有积压和使用率不高的现象；在仪器、化学试剂的生产和进口方面，还缺乏统筹安排和全面计划。这些缺点，在一定程度上妨碍着科学研究工作的进展。在大鸣大放时期，科学家在这方面曾提出了不少意见，其中绝大部分应该肯定是正确的。这是我国社会主义建设事业前进中的困难，是可以在工作中逐渐克服的。然而，资产阶级右派，曾极力利用这种暂时的困难，夸大工作中的缺点，大肆攻击我们的党和政府的领导，攻击社会主义制度。章、罗联盟反共反社会主义的科学纲领，就是他们的罪证。
    现在人们都更清楚地看到，究竟谁对科学研究工作给予真正的关怀，从多方面为科学家解决工作条件的问题呢？显然不是旧中国的反动统治者和目前一小撮资产阶级右派，而是中国共产党及其领导下的人民政府。现在公布的四个方案，再一次证明了这样一个真理。各有关主管部门和各科学机关今后的任务，就是要在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，通过整顿作风和执行这四个方案，坚决地克服这些缺点，彻底地改进我们的工作。
    当然，解决科学工作条件问题，是一个极其复杂细致的工作，它牵涉的面很广。要根本解决这个问题，还有赖于我国整个经济文化事业的发展。从目前来看，我们要改进这些工作，一方面要改善生产、进口和整理、出版工作，使图书、资料、仪器、化学试剂等无论在数量、质量上，尽可能满足科学工作的要求；另方面，又要改善管理、供应和使用制度，积极挖掘潜力，尽量发挥和提高现有机构、人员、财力、物力的作用。
    为了做好上述工作，首先必须加强组织工作和协调工作。不论是图书资料的整理和使用，也不论是仪器、化学试剂的生产和进口，都应该在国家统一领导下，有组织、有计划、有步骤地进行。例如图书、资料工作方面，目前就有这样的情况：一方面，仅文化部系统，就有一千万册以上的图书没有整理出来加以利用，不少图书馆藏书复本过多；而另一方面，却有些科学机关缺乏这种图书。同样还有许多部门的资料未加整理，不能充分利用。在仪器和化学试剂方面，虽然几年来生产和进口的数量、质量和品种都有显著的增加和提高，但是由于缺乏统一的生产、进口计划和供应制度，供需部门之间还缺乏密切配合和有机联系，产品规格缺乏统一的标准，所以，有些仪器和化学试剂虽然生产出来了，但是不合使用部门的要求。甚至有时因为对外贸易部门不了解国内生产情况，该进口的没有进口，不该进口的反而进口了。这不仅给科学研究工作带来困难，也给国家财政开支造成了不应有的损失。现在，科学规划委员会决定成立图书、资料、仪器和化学试剂四个小组，专门负责这方面的工作。他们今后的任务，就是要在全面安排、加强协作的方针下，逐步把各项工作纳入计划轨道，克服各单位各自为政、缺乏联系、不注意协调的现象。
    我国在科学工作方面的投资，虽然在逐年增加，但是在今后较长时间内，仍难完全满足科学工作的需要。这就要求我们科学部门，学会精打细算地过日子，提倡勤俭办科学的风气。在购置各种设备时，要仔细计算，分别轻重缓急。那种缺乏重点、盲目摆摊子、房屋设备求全求大的作法，是应该坚决制止的。各科学部门的原有设备，能够利用或修配以后能够利用的，就要尽量利用。有些图书、仪器、设备，能够联合使用的，要尽量联合使用；本单位暂时用不着的，就应该主动调给其它部门使用。在必要时，各单位也可以通过协商方式，规定临时协作制度，加强合作，相互支援，互通有无，把现有的科学设备充分利用起来。各科学部门，应该进一步树立全局观点，从国家的整体利益出发，克服本位主义，主动服从国家统一领导的协调工作。
    为了改善图书、资料、仪器和化学试剂的供应工作，各有关主管部门和生产供销单位，应该进一步改进工作方法，端正服务态度。在图书资料工作方面，要尽可能简化借阅手续，改善保密制度。在仪器和化学试剂的供应上，各有关主管部门和生产单位，应该主动同科学部门加强联系，了解他们的需要；自己能够生产和修配的，就应该尽量生产和修配。各生产单位之间，也应该加强联系，互通情况，交流生产技术经验。这样既可以避免生产中的重复浪费现象，又可以提高科学仪器和化学试剂的生产技术。目前有个别主管部门和生产单位，对待这项工作，还有嫌复杂、怕麻烦、想尽量少管或一推了之的情绪。这是一种对待科学事业的不负责任的官僚主义态度，必须加以纠正。要知道，生产和修配仪器以及生产特种化学试剂，虽然是一件麻烦的事情，但是它也有很大好处，既可以节省国家外汇，又可以提高我国的科学技术水平。这样的好事，大家何乐而不为呢？
    在为科学部门服务方面，有些地方已经创造了很好的经验。例如天津成立了科学工作服务处，专门负责这方面的工作。他们深入了解科学部门的要求和生产单位的生产特点，给双方介绍关系，解决了很多科学部门的仪器和化学试剂的供应和修配问题。他们的人数很少，但工作很活跃，作出了一些成绩，得到科学界的好评。这种做法是值得科学机构较多的城市效法的。
    我国科学家，是有勤俭办科学的优良传统的。他们在旧中国科学工作条件极端困难的情况下，惨淡经营，坚持了科学研究工作。解放后，也有许多科学家亲自动手改装和修配仪器，改旧为新，节省了国家的费用。现在，我们科学工作的条件，已经比解放前大大地改善了。我们有党和政府的大力领导和支持，又有伟大苏联和各人民民主国家的无私援助，只要我们继续发扬这种优良传统，艰苦朴素，克勤克俭地发展我国科学事业，我们在科学战线上就一定能够取得辉煌的胜利。
