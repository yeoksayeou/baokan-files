Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th - TASS, Moscow: A grand military parade and mass procession were held on Red Square in Moscow today to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

Many guests were invited to Red Square. On the reviewing stands adjacent to the Kremlin wall stood veteran members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union – participants in the 1905 Revolution and the Great October Revolution, as well as workers from Soviet factories, collective farm members, scientists, writers, representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, ministers of the Soviet ministries, delegations from fraternal communist and workers' parties, envoys of the working people of many countries, and prominent social and cultural figures from many countries who came to participate in the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of Soviet power.

Also attending the parade were diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries to the Soviet Union.

When the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, as well as the heads of delegations from various socialist countries, fraternal communist and workers' parties, ascended the Lenin and Stalin Mausoleum, those in attendance greeted them with thunderous and sustained applause.

The military parade began at 9:00 AM (Moscow time).

The new Soviet military technology on display at today's parade was most noteworthy. Among them were rocket weapons – heavy rocket launchers, with their giant rockets mounted on launchers and carried by automobiles and tracked conveyors, rumbling past the reviewing stand. The power and range of these rocket launchers are far greater than those of the "Katyusha" rocket launchers famous during World War II. Also participating in the parade on Red Square were indestructible rockets. The Soviet Union possesses all necessary long-range, medium-range, and short-range rockets. Furthermore, it is known that the Soviet Union has already created an intercontinental ballistic missile.

Motorized infantry units with self-propelled anti-aircraft guns and amphibious tracked armored vehicles passed through Red Square. Neither muddy roads, forests, swamps, nor bodies of water can stop their advance. New heavy tanks also participated in this year's parade. These tanks are characterized by their great maneuverability and passability.

Marshal Malinovsky, the Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, accompanied by Marshal Moskalenko, the commander of the parade, inspected the troops lined up on Red Square and the streets near Red Square. Marshal Malinovsky congratulated the heroic Soviet soldiers on the great October Revolution Day, then ascended the platform of the mausoleum and delivered a speech to the Soviet army, foreign guests, and all Soviet working people.

Marshal Malinovsky emphasized that the Soviet people are realizing the great plans for communist construction, that they are fervently devoted to peace, and that they are struggling to establish friendship and cooperation between the peoples of all countries. However, the aggressive blocs of imperialist countries, primarily the United States, are continuing to pursue policies that sharpen international tensions. They are establishing military blocs, doing everything possible to obstruct any practical disarmament measures, and threatening all of humanity with the disaster of a destructive atomic war. Marshal Malinovsky pointed out that the enemies of peace are attempting new adventures in the Near East; innocent people in Algeria, Yemen, and Oman are bleeding; and the imperialists are colluding to attack and intimidate Syria. The Soviet people resolutely condemn the colonialists' interference in the internal affairs of Near Eastern countries and express sympathy for the people of all countries who are struggling for freedom and national independence.

In concluding his speech, the Soviet Minister of Defense said that the Soviet armed forces, founded and nurtured by the Communist Party, are now stronger than ever. They are capable of annihilating any aggressor should it dare to invade the Soviet Union.

The parade then began. According to tradition, the flower and pride of the Soviet armed forces – the students of the military academies – were the first to receive the solemn inspection. The military academies train commanders capable of mastering the latest combat techniques. Among those marching on Red Square were not only young soldiers, but also veteran officers who had participated in the battles of the October Revolution of 1917 and the Civil War of 1917-1922, as well as military leaders who had shouldered the heavy responsibility of leading battles in the Great Patriotic War. After the orderly ranks of the military academy students had passed, the ranks of Soviet border guards marched by. Following them were sailors and the youngest participants in the inspection – the students of the Suvorov Military School and the Nakhimov Naval School.

Units of the Taman Guards Motorized Division, famous in the battles of the Great Patriotic War, rode past the reviewing stand in armored vehicles. Behind them were the tank teams of the renowned Kantemirovskaya Division, which had also won many battles in World War II.

The military parade lasted fifty minutes.

Immediately afterwards, the festive procession of the working people of Moscow began.

According to tradition, a motorcycle column led the procession. Then, the athletes' teams entered Red Square. They changed formations from time to time, forming the characters for "Forty Years" and then "Glory to Labor!", at which point cheers erupted from the reviewing stand.

Amidst a sea of red flags, a silver armored car bearing a statue of Lenin slowly advanced along Red Square.

Suddenly, thunderous applause rang out again, as the honored guests on the reviewing stand warmly welcomed a model of the earth-orbiting artificial satellite held high in the procession.

The procession of the working people of Moscow continued, with more and more of the red flag ocean engulfing Red Square. Images of Marx, Engels, and Lenin emerged above the cheering crowd. Everywhere, flags and banners displayed the number "40".

The procession carried many banners indicating the achievements of the Soviet people in various aspects of construction. The ranks of workers from Moscow's famous Likhachev Automobile Factory, the "Dynamo" Factory, the "Three Mountains Textile Mill," the "Red Proletarian" machine tool plant, and the "Hammer and Sickle" steel plant, as well as many other factories, passed by. The older generation still remembers that thirty-three years ago, when the columns of Moscow auto makers passed through Red Square, ten of the first Soviet-made cars drove at the front of their column. And today, the Moscow auto workers can proudly tell people that their cars can be seen in every corner of the Soviet Union. The textile workers of the famous "Three Mountains Textile Mill" have also achieved outstanding production results, having produced five billion meters of fabric in the forty years since the establishment of Soviet power.

The audience paid tribute to the workers of the Moscow Ball Bearing Factory, the Ordzhonikidze Machine Tool Factory, the Clock Factory, the Tire Factory, the Automobile Factory, and other factories built after the revolution. Like other industrial enterprises in the Moscow economic region, they greeted the festival by overfulfilling their October production plans, producing a total of nearly two billion rubles of products for the country above the plan.

The columns of collective farmers from the suburbs of Moscow and staff members of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition entered Red Square. Socialist agricultural workers also have things to be proud of. In forty years, the sown area in the entire Soviet Union has increased to more than one and a half times that before the revolution, and now they are striving to catch up with the United States in the production of milk, fats, and meat per capita in the next few years.

The audience greeted the ranks of Soviet scientists with stormy applause. They celebrated the national holiday with the unprecedented achievement of successfully launching two artificial earth satellites. The marchers carried models of satellites, atomic power stations, and electronic computers. Colorful signs indicated the achievements of the selfless labor of Soviet scientists working in the North and South Poles, as well as the construction of the world's largest synchrophasotron, the construction of large hydroelectric power stations, and the many other contributions of the Soviet Union's 240,000 scientists to the country.

Laughter, joy, and singing filled Red Square. This was to tell people: The columns of students from Moscow universities and members of the Communist Youth League had passed by. They have restored the glorious tradition of Lenin's voluntary Saturday labor, often going to work on construction sites in Moscow. They recently welcomed youth representatives from 130 countries at the World Youth Festival, demonstrating their own belief in the sacred slogan "For Peace and Friendship!"

"For Peace," "Strive for World Peace," these words from the hearts of the Soviet people now reappear on tens of thousands of flags and tens of thousands of banners and posters.

On the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet people extend brotherly greetings to the people of all countries who are struggling for peace, democracy, and socialism. They express their unanimous support for the peace policies of the beloved socialist countries, their struggle to ban atomic weapons, and their struggle for world peace. The cheers paying tribute to the great China, to the people of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and other socialist countries, resounded over Red Square.

The festive procession of the masses in Moscow continued for several hours.

Hundreds of thousands of working people participated in this procession. This procession demonstrated the unbreakable unity and solidarity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, who have advanced along the road of great victory for forty years.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th – The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union held a grand reception in the Kremlin at 8:00 PM (Moscow time) tonight to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

Chairman Mao and all members of the Chinese delegation attended the reception.

Also attending the reception were delegations from other socialist countries, delegations from communist and workers' parties of various countries, and other foreign delegations.

The Chinese military goodwill delegation to the Soviet Union and the labor people's delegation also attended the reception.

Soviet party and government leaders attended the reception.

Also attending the reception were Soviet government ministers, marshals, generals, heads of social organizations, and representatives from all walks of life.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union, as well as representatives from Soviet and foreign press circles, also attended the reception.

Men and women guests from various countries, filled with warm emotions, crowded the Georgievsky Hall and the Faceted Chamber to attend the reception.

At the time of sending the telegram, the reception was about to begin. (Attached picture)

    更高地举起十月革命的旗帜奋勇前进
    莫斯科举行盛大阅兵式和游行
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏共中央、部长会议举行招待会
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科红场上7日举行了盛大的阅兵式和群众游行，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。
    许多客人被邀请来到红场。在靠着克里姆林宫宫墙的观礼台上，站着苏联共产党老党员——1905年革命和伟大十月革命的参加者，以及苏联各工厂的工人、集体农庄庄员、科学家、作家、苏联最高苏维埃代表、苏联各部部长、各兄弟国家共产党和工人党的代表团、许多国家劳动人民的使者和前来参加庆祝苏维埃政权四十周年的许多国家的著名社会文化人士。
      参观阅兵式的还有各国驻苏联的外交使节和陆军武官。
      当苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导人以及各社会主义国家、兄弟共产党和工人党的代表团的团长登上了列宁和斯大林陵墓的时候，出席观礼的人们用经久不息的掌声热烈地欢迎他们。
    阅兵式在上午九时（莫斯科时间）开始。
    在今天的阅兵式当中，受检阅的苏联新式军事技术装备最引人注目。其中，有火箭式武器——重型火箭炮，它的巨型火箭弹安装在发射装置上，由汽车和链轨输送机载着，轰轰隆隆地驶过检阅台前。这种火箭炮的威力和射程比第二次世界大战期间闻名的“卡秋莎”火箭炮要强大得多。在红场参加检阅的还有无坚不摧的火箭。苏联拥有一切必须的远射程火箭、中程火箭和近程火箭。此外，大家还知道，苏联已经制成了洲际弹道火箭。
    摩托兵部队的自动推进双筒高射炮和水陆两用履带式装甲车通过了红场。不论是泥泞不堪的道路、森林、沼泽或水面都不能阻挡它们前进。新型的重型坦克今年又参加了阅兵的行列。这种坦克的特点是具有极大的机动性和通过能力。
    苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅在阅兵指挥官莫斯卡连科元帅陪同下，乘车检阅了排列在红场上和红场附近街道上的军队。马利诺夫斯基元帅向英勇的苏军战士祝贺伟大的十月革命节以后登上陵墓的台上，向苏联军队、外宾和全体苏联劳动人民发表了演说。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅强调指出，苏联人民正在实现着伟大的共产主义建设计划，他们热心地致力于和平，为建立各国人民间的友谊与合作而斗争。但是，帝国主义国家的侵略集团、首先是美国还在继续执行使国际紧张局势尖锐化的政策，他们在建立军事集团，千方百计地阻挠任何实际的裁军措施，以毁灭性的原子战争的灾难威胁着全人类。马利诺夫斯基元帅指出，和平的敌人企图在近东进行新的冒险，阿尔及利亚、也门和阿曼的无辜的人们在流血，帝国主义者勾结一起攻击和恫吓叙利亚。苏联人民坚决斥责殖民主义者干涉近东国家的内政，并对那些为自由和民族独立而斗争的各国人民表示同情。
    苏联国防部长在结束自己的演说时说，共产党所创立和培养的苏联武装部队现在比任何时候都更强大了。他们能够歼灭任何侵略者，假如它敢于侵犯苏联。
    接着，阅兵式开始。按照传统习惯，苏联武装部队的花朵和骄傲——军事学院学员——最先接受了庄严的检阅。在军事学院里培养着能够掌握最新战斗技术的指挥员。在红场上走过的队伍中不仅有年青的军人，同时还有曾经参加过1917年十月革命战役和1917年至1922年国内战争的老一代的军官们，也有在伟大卫国战争中肩负领导战斗的重任的军事首长们。军事学院学员的整齐的队伍走完以后，苏联边防军战士的队伍走来了。随后，又是海员和最年青的受检阅者——苏沃洛夫军事学校和纳希莫夫军事学校的学员们。
    在伟大卫国战争的历次战斗中闻名的塔曼近卫军摩托师的分队乘着装甲车驶过检阅台。他们的后面是著名的康捷米罗夫斯克师的坦克队，这支部队在第二次世界大战中也曾经屡建战功。
    阅兵式历时五十分钟结束。
    随后，莫斯科劳动人民的节日游行立即开始了。
    按照传统，摩托车队驶在游行队伍最前面。接着，运动员的队伍走进了红场。他们不时变换着队形，一会儿组成“四十年”、一会儿又组成
  “劳动光荣！”的字形，这时，观礼台上响起了欢呼声。
    在红色的旗海中间，竖着列宁像的银色装甲汽车缓缓地沿着红场前进。
    忽然，又响起了雷鸣般的掌声，这是观礼台上的贵宾们在热烈欢迎高举在游行队伍上面的绕地球旋转的人造卫星模型。
    莫斯科劳动人民的游行队伍继续前进着，越来越多的红旗的海洋淹没了红场。马克思、恩格斯和列宁的画像在欢腾着的人海上面显露出来。到处，旗帜和军旗上都写着“四十”这个数字。
    游行队伍高举着许多横幅牌子，上面标明着苏联人民在各方面建设中所取得的成就的数字。莫斯科著名的利哈乔夫汽车工厂、“狄纳莫”工厂、“三山纺织厂”、“红色无产者”工作母机制造厂和“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂以及许多其他工厂的职工队伍走过来了。老一代的人们还记得，三十三年以前、莫斯科汽车制造者的队伍走过红场的时候，他们队伍前面有十辆第一批苏联制造的汽车行驶着。而今天，莫斯科的汽车制造工人已经能够自豪地告诉人们，目前在苏联任何一个角落都能看到他们制造的汽车了。著名的“三山纺织厂”的纺织工人的生产成绩也十分出色，在苏维埃政权建立后的四十年中，他们已经生产了五十亿公尺织品。
    观众向革命后建成的莫斯科滚珠轴承工厂、奥尔忠尼启则机床制造厂、钟表厂、轮胎厂、小汽车厂等工厂的工人们致敬。同莫斯科市经济区其他工业企业一样，他们用提前完成了10月份的生产计划来迎接节日，总共为国家超计划生产了将近二十亿卢布的产品。
    莫斯科近郊的集体农民、苏联农业展览会的工作人员的队伍走进了红场。社会主义农业劳动者也有着使他们感到自豪的事情。四十年来，全苏联的播种面积已经增加为革命前的一倍半以上，现在，他们正努力争取在最近几年内使奶类、油脂和肉类按人口平均计算的产量赶上美国。
    观众以暴风雨般的掌声欢迎苏联科学家的队伍。他们以成功地发射两颗人造地球卫星的空前的成就来庆祝全民的节日。游行者抬着卫星、原子能电站、电子计算机的模型。五颜六色的标语牌标明着在南北极工作的苏联科学研究人员忘我劳动的成就，还标明着世界上最大的同步稳相加速器的建造、大水电站的建设以及苏联二十四万科学家为国家所作的其他许多贡献。
    红场上响起了青年们的笑声、欢乐声和歌声。这是在告诉人们：莫斯科各高等学校的学生、共青团员们的队伍走过来了。他们恢复了列宁的义务星期六的光荣传统，常常到莫斯科各工地去劳动。他们不久前在世界青年联欢节上迎接了来自一百三十个国家的青年代表，显示了青年们自己对“为了和平和友谊！”这一神圣口号的信念。
    “为了和平”，“争取世界和平”，这些发自苏联人内心的话现在又重现在成千上万面的旗帜上面、成千上万幅的标语牌和宣传画上面。
    在十月革命四十周年的日子里，苏联人民向正在为争取和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的各国人民致兄弟敬礼。他们表示一致支持亲爱的社会主义国家的和平政策，支持它们的争取禁止原子武器的斗争和争取世界和平的斗争。红场上空，响彻了向伟大中国致敬的欢呼声，向阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫以及其他社会主义国家人民致敬的欢呼声。
    莫斯科群众的节日游行行列继续了几个小时。
    参加这次游行的有几十万劳动群众。这次游行显示了四十年来沿着伟大胜利道路前进的苏联共产党和苏联人民的牢不可破的团结和一致。
    新华社莫斯科7日电　苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议，今天晚间八时（莫斯科时间）在克里姆林宫举行盛大招待会，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。
