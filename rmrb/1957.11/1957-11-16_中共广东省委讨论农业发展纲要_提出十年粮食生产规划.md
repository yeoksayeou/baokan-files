Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 13th, (Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Ding Dong reports): The CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee recently, based on the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, proposed a ten-year grain production increase plan. It calls for raising the average annual grain yield per mu in the province from the current 500 jin to 850 jin by 1967, and the total output from the current 24.5 billion jin to 40 billion jin. What is the basis for this requirement? What is the possibility? The reporter interviewed the person in charge of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee on the 12th regarding this.

The person in charge of the Guangdong Provincial Committee said: The basis for formulating this huge plan is found by comparing the production conditions in the next ten years with those during the First Five-Year Plan period.

The person in charge said that first, agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province are becoming increasingly consolidated. In the First Five-Year Plan, production was carried out without the realization of cooperativization for the first three years; in the last two years, although cooperatives were established and played a significant role in promoting production, their advantages were not fully utilized. Now, after two years of testing, the production relations of most cooperatives are becoming increasingly perfect, and the level of operation and management is gradually improving. In particular, through this extensive airing of views, big debates, and in-depth socialist education and democratic rectification movement, cooperatives will be greatly consolidated, which is a powerful guarantee for developing agriculture and increasing grain production.

Second, water conservancy facilities have a foundation, and production is relatively stable. In the past five years, although Guangdong Province achieved production increases in four years and maintained production in one year despite annual disasters, the threat of floods and droughts throughout the province has not been eliminated. There are still 6 million mu of "wait-for-rain fields" lacking water conservancy, and the Dongjiang and Jianjiang river basins frequently suffer from floods and droughts. In order to ensure the continuous increase in grain production in the future, Guangdong Province has decided to invest more efforts in water conservancy, striving to eliminate ordinary droughts and floods within five years. In the Second Five-Year Plan, the state has initially determined to invest 300 million yuan in water conservancy construction, nearly double the water conservancy investment in the First Five-Year Plan. Various prefectures and counties will also raise their own funds to build many medium and small-sized water conservancy facilities. In addition, the state will build several larger water conservancy projects in Guangdong, such as the Dongjiang River management, the construction of the Xinfengjiang Reservoir, the Songtao Reservoir in Hainan, and the Liangde Reservoir in Jianjiang. With so many newly added water conservancy projects and the improvement of the irrigation capacity of existing water conservancy projects, the water conservancy conditions will be much better than in the past.

Third, more fertilizer will be accumulated in the future. During the First Five-Year Plan, not enough pigs were raised. The development has been faster this year, but the total social stock in the province is only 8 million heads. Most cooperatives have not established fertilizer bases, and the supply of chemical fertilizers is also very small. In the future, the pig-raising industry will be vigorously developed, requiring an average of two pigs per household throughout the province by 1962, totaling 15 million pigs. If each pig provides manure for two mu of land, the fertilizer problem for 30 million mu of land can be solved. We must also vigorously promote the planting of green manure. This year, green manure bases have begun to be established in some areas and cooperatives, but there are still many winter fallow fields where green manure can be planted extensively. In addition, the supply of chemical fertilizers will gradually increase in the future. If the fertilizer problem is solved well, the increase in grain production will not be a problem.

Fourth, great achievements have been made in implementing technical reforms in the past, but the shortcomings are that some places have not adapted to local conditions, and some have not persisted in implementing them. Technical reforms will continue to be carried out vigorously in the future, especially the experience of the Huiyang area should be promoted. Combined with water conservancy construction and other production increase measures, soil should be improved on a large scale, and backward fields should be transformed.

The person in charge said that the grain production level in various parts of the province is currently very unbalanced. According to the 1956 data, about 6% of the province's grain cultivated area has a grain yield of more than 800 jin per mu; about 24% has a yield of 500 to 800 jin; and about 70% has a yield of less than 500 jin, of which low-yield fields with less than 400 jin account for about 40%. If we can increase the current grain yield of more than 800 jin per mu to 1,000 to 1,100 jin, increase the 500 to 800 jin to 800 to 1,000 jin, and strive to increase more than 80% of the less than 500 jin to 800 jin, then it is certain that the average annual yield per mu of cultivated land in the province will reach the production increase target of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program by 1967.

The person in charge finally said that an agricultural production upsurge centered on increasing grain production will be launched in the province recently. The current key is to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking in leadership, and require all leading cadres to go deep into the masses in a down-to-earth manner, and lead this agricultural production upsurge with perseverance and determination.

### 中共广东省委讨论农业发展纲要  提出十年粮食生产规划

    中共广东省委讨论农业发展纲要
    提出十年粮食生产规划
    新华社广州13日电　新华社特约记者丁东报道：中共广东省委近日根据全国农业发展纲要修正草案，提出一个十年粮食增产计划，要求到1967年，全省平均每亩地年产粮食由现在的五百斤提高到八百五十斤，总产量从现在的二百四十五亿斤提高到四百亿斤。这个要求的根据是什么？可能性怎样？记者为此在12日访问了中共广东省委负责人。
    广东省委负责人说：我们拟订这个巨大计划的根据，是从今后十年生产条件和第一个五年计划期间生产条件相比较中找到的。
    负责人说，首先，全省农业生产合作社日趋巩固。在第一个五年中，头三年是在没有实现合作化的情况下进行生产的；在后两年，合作社虽然办起来了，对生产起了很大的推动作用，但是它的优越性还没有充分发挥出来。现在合作社经过两年的考验，大部分社的生产关系日益完善，经营管理水平逐步提高，特别是通过这次大鸣大放大争，进行深入的社会主义教育和民主整社运动，合作社将大大巩固起来，这对发展农业、增产粮食是很有力的保证。
    其次，水利设施有了基础，生产已较稳定。过去五年中，广东省虽然在年年有灾的情况下做到了四年增产，一年保产。但是，全省的水旱灾害威胁并没有消除，缺乏水利的“望天田”还有六百万亩，东江和鉴江流域经常闹水灾旱灾。为了保证今后粮食不断增产，广东省已决定以更大力量来兴修水利，力求在五年内消灭普通的旱灾和水灾。在第二个五年中，国家初步确定投资三亿元于水利建设，比第一个五年的水利投资增加近两倍。各专署和县还将自筹资金兴修许多中小型水利设施。此外，国家还将在广东兴建几处较大的水利工程，如整治东江，修建新丰江水库、海南的松涛水库和鉴江的良德水库等。有了这样多新增加的水利工程，再提高原有水利工程的灌溉能力，水利条件就要比过去好得多。
    第三，今后将更多地积肥。在第一个五年中，养猪还不够多，今年发展较快，但全省的社会存量也只有八百万头；合作社的肥料基地绝大多数没有建立起来；化学肥料的供应量也很少。今后养猪事业要大力发展，要求到1962年全省平均每户养猪两头，共养一千五百万头。如果每头猪沤肥供二亩田施用，就可以解决三千万亩田的肥料问题。还要大力推广种植绿肥，今年已在一些地区和合作社开始建立绿肥基地，但冬闲田还很多，可以大量种绿肥。此外，化学肥料的供应量今后将会逐渐增加。肥料问题解决得好，粮食增产也就不成问题了。
    第四，在贯彻执行技术改革方面，过去取得很大成绩，不足的是有些地方没有因地制宜，也有的没有坚持贯彻下去。今后技术改革仍将大力进行，特别要推广惠阳地区的经验，结合兴修水利及其它增产措施，大规模改良土壤，改造落后田。
    这位负责人说，目前全省各地粮食生产水平很不平衡。根据1956年的材料，每亩粮食产量达八百斤以上的约占全省粮食耕地面积的6％；五百到八百斤的约占24％；五百斤以下的约占70％，其中四百斤以下的低产田约占40％。如果能够使现在每亩粮食产量在八百斤以上的提高到一千到一千一百斤，五百到八百斤的提高到八百到一千斤，五百斤以下的争取80％以上提高到八百斤，这样，全省耕地每亩平均年产量要在1967年达到全国农业发展纲要修正草案的增产指标，就肯定可以实现了。
    这位负责人最后说，一个以增产粮食为中心的农业生产高潮，将于最近在全省掀起来。目前的关键在于克服领导上的右倾保守思想，要求所有领导干部踏实地深入群众，以坚忍不拔的毅力和决心来领导这个农业生产高潮。
