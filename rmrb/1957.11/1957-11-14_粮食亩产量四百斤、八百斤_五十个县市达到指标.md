Grain Yields of 400 and 800 Jin Per Mu
Fifty Counties and Cities Achieve Targets

(Our Dispatch) Fifty counties and cities in eleven provinces, including Guangdong and Hubei, have already reached the grain production increase targets of 400 and 800 jin per mu respectively, as required by the National Agricultural Development Program
(according to incomplete statistics). The counties and cities reaching the 400 jin target are: Zhengding, Gaocheng, Zunhua, Funing, Lulong, Anguo, Luancheng, Xinle, Baoding City, Shijiazhuang City (all in Hebei Province), Gaoling, Chang'an, Xianyang City, Xi'an City (all in Shaanxi Province), Mengxian, Anyang City (all in Henan Province), Dunhuang, Linze, Zhangye (all in Gansu Province), Fushun City (Liaoning Province). The counties and cities reaching the 800 jin target are: Chao'an, Puning, Jieyang, Chaoyang, Nan'ao, Raoping, Chenghai, Shantou City, Foshan City, Chaozhou City (all in Guangdong Province), Xiaogan, Xishui, Huangpi, Hongan, Dawu, Macheng, Xinzhou, Yunmeng (all in Hubei Province), Longxi, Haicheng, Changle, Fuzhou City, Zhangzhou City (all in Fujian Province), Cixi, Huangyan, Wenling, Hangzhou City, Wenzhou City (all in Zhejiang Province), Yiliang
(Yunnan Province), Pixian (Sichuan Province).

Among these counties and cities, twenty-nine have achieved the 400 jin and 800 jin targets since last year. Huangxian County in Shandong Province, which reached the 500 jin target last year, experienced a historically rare drought this year, and the average yield of grain per mu has decreased to 490 jin. Although this yield is lower than last year, it is still more than 30 jin per mu higher than in the bumper year of 1953.

The actual yields of most counties and cities with grain yields of 400 and 800 jin per mu have exceeded the targets to be achieved. Among the thirty counties and cities reaching the 800 jin target, the actual yields of Chao'an, Puning, Jieyang, Chaoyang, Nan'ao, Chenghai, Longxi, Xiaogan and other counties have reached 1,000 jin or more. Most of the counties and cities reaching the 400 jin per mu target have also exceeded the targets to be achieved.

Macheng and Cixi counties, which have both cotton and wheat crops, have reached the 800 jin grain production target while also reaching the 100 jin per mu target for ginned cotton. Shijiazhuang City and Dunhuang County, which reached the 400 jin per mu grain production target this year, have also reached the 100 jin per mu target for ginned cotton. Xishui County, which reached the 800 jin per mu grain production target this year, also achieved an average yield of 82 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Hongan County in Hubei Province has the highest average peanut yield per mu in the country this year. The county's average yield of peanuts per mu this year is 625 jin, with more than 11,000 mu achieving a peanut yield of 1,000 jin or more per mu.

Many regions that have reached the 400 jin and 800 jin targets are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made and have proposed higher targets. Shantou Prefecture, which reached the 800 jin target this year, has set a plan to reach a yield of 1,000 jin per mu during the second five-year plan. The Xiaogan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei Province, based on the fact that the average grain yield per mu in Xiaogan, Huangpi and other counties has reached 800 to 950 jin and the production conditions in the entire region, proposed in the plan: In 1958, the entire prefecture will strive for an average yield of 700 to 800 jin per mu, and in 1967, it will strive for a yield of 1,000 to 1,100 jin per mu. Many counties in Hebei Province that reached the 400 jin target this year have put forward the slogan of "Striving to Cross the Yellow River in Terms of Targets." Based on this spirit, Zunhua County has set a plan for a grain yield of 460 jin per mu next year.

    粮食亩产量四百斤、八百斤
    五十个县市达到指标
    本报讯　广东、湖北等十一个省的五十个县、市，已经在今年分别达到农业发展纲要所要求的四百斤、八百斤的粮食增产指标
  （根据不完全的统计）。达到四百斤指标的县、市是：正定、藁城、遵化、抚宁、卢龙、安国、栾城、新乐、保定市、石家庄市（以上河北省）、高陵、长安、咸阳市、西安市（以上陕西省）、孟县、安阳市（以上河南省）、敦煌、临泽、张掖（以上甘肃省）、抚顺市（辽宁省）。达到八百斤指标的县、市是：潮安、普宁、揭阳、潮阳、南澳、饶平、澄海、汕头市、佛山市、潮州市（以上广东省）、孝感、浠水、黄陂、红安、大悟、麻城、新洲、云梦（以上湖北省）、龙溪、海澄、长乐、福州市、漳州市（以上福建省）、慈溪、黄岩、温岭、杭州市、温州市（以上浙江省）、宜良
  （云南省）、郫县（四川省）。
    在这些县、市中，有二十九个从去年起就达到了四百斤、八百斤的指标。去年达到五百斤指标的山东省黄县，今年由于遭受了历史上少有旱灾，今年粮食的每亩平均产量降低到四百九十斤。这个产量虽然低于去年，但比丰收的1953年，每亩仍增产三十多斤。
    多数亩产粮食四百斤、八百斤的县、市的实际产量，都已超出应达到的指标。达到八百斤的三十个县、市当中，潮安、普宁、揭阳、潮阳、南澳、澄海、龙溪、孝感等县的实际产量，已达到千斤或是一千斤以上。达到亩产四百斤指标的县、市，也大部分超过了应达到的指标。
    棉麦两熟地区的麻城、慈溪两县，今年在达到八百斤的粮食增产指标的同时，还达到了亩产百斤皮棉的指标。今年达到亩产粮食四百斤指标的石家庄市、敦煌县，也达到了亩产皮棉百斤的指标。今年达到亩产粮食八百斤指标的浠水县，今年皮棉每亩平均产量也达到八十二斤。湖北省红安县，今年全县花生每亩平均产量也是全国最高的。这个县今年全县平均亩产花生六百二十五斤，有一万一千多亩亩产花生达到一千斤以上。
    许多达到四百斤、八百斤指标的地区，并没有满足已得到的成就，纷纷提出更高的指标。今年达到八百斤指标的汕头专区，已订出了在第二个五年计划期间达到亩产一千斤的规划。中共湖北孝感地委会，根据今年孝感、黄陂等县粮食平均亩产量已经达到八百斤至九百五十斤的情况和全区的生产条件，在规划中提出：1958年全专区争取平均亩产七百至八百斤，1967年争取亩产一千斤至一千一百斤。河北省不少今年达到四百斤指标的县，提出了“争取指标过黄河”的口号。遵化县根据这种精神，订出了明年亩产粮食四百六十斤的规划。
