Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 18th: Newspapers here published on the 17th a decree from the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic abolishing worker committees. At the same time they published a joint decision from the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and the Presidium of the Central Council of the National Federation of Free Trade Unions on establishing factory committees.

The joint decision states that, in order to expand factory democracy, it has been decided to establish factory committees under the leadership of trade unions. All state-owned factories, mines, farms, and national enterprises such as railways and postal and telecommunications services must establish factory committees. Two-thirds of the committee members will be trade union workers, factory leaders, etc., and one-third will be directly elected by the workers. The factory director, chief engineer, chief accountant, and secretaries of the Party and Youth League organizations are ex-officio members of the committee.

The joint decision stipulates that the factory committee has the right to be involved in all affairs of the factory. Its tasks include inspection and suggestions, and it has the right to make resolutions. The right to make decisions on major issues in the factory belongs to the director, but the opinions of the factory committee should play a certain role.
