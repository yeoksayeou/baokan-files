Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its eighty-sixth meeting on the afternoon of the 29th.

The meeting deliberated on Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council's proposal regarding the election times for representatives to the people's congresses at all levels in municipalities directly under the central government and counties in 1958. The proposal stated, "According to the resolution of the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress on the election issues for the Second National People's Congress, the election of representatives to the Second National People's Congress must be completed before July 15, 1958, and the election of representatives to the Second People's Congresses of provinces and autonomous regions must be completed before June 15, 1958. Due to the varying times of establishment of people's congresses at all levels in municipalities directly under the central government and at the county level and below, the election times for representatives to the Second People's Congresses at all levels in municipalities directly under the central government and at the county level and below are also uneven. In order to ensure a smooth transition between the election of representatives to people's congresses at all levels, it is recommended that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress make a decision."

After discussion, the meeting made the following decision: The election of representatives to the people's congresses of counties, cities, municipal districts, townships, ethnic townships, and towns in 1958 must be completed before May 31, 1958; the election of representatives to the people's congresses of municipalities directly under the central government must be completed before June 15, 1958.

After listening to the explanation by Zhou Xing, Vice Minister of Public Security, the meeting approved in principle the Fire Supervision Regulations. These regulations will be promulgated and implemented by the State Council.

After listening to the explanation by Xie Hechou, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, the meeting approved the Organizational Regulations of the People's Congress and the People's Committee of the Qian Gorlos Mongolian Autonomous County in Jilin Province.

Qian Gorlos Mongolian Autonomous County is located in the western part of Jilin Province, bordering Fuyu County to the east, Nong'an County to the south, Changling and Kaitong Counties to the west, and Dalai and Qian'an Counties to the north. It is a fertile area with vast grasslands, covering an area of approximately 7,200 square kilometers and a population of over 200,400, including over 185,000 Han Chinese, over 16,000 Mongolians, as well as Manchus, Huis, Koreans, and Xibe people. The total minority population is over 19,700, accounting for slightly less than 10% of the total population. The Mongolian population accounts for slightly more than 8% of the total population and slightly less than 85% of the total minority population.

The autonomous county was originally named Qian Gorlos Banner. It was developed by Mongolians during the Yuan Dynasty. Forty years ago, it was still a purely Mongolian area, and Han Chinese gradually moved in and settled later. The banner system has been maintained in this area. After the promulgation of the Constitution, it was reorganized as Qian Gorlos Autonomous County on December 31, 1955, with the consent of the Mongolian and Han people through consultation. The economy of the autonomous county is mainly based on agriculture, and the livestock industry managed by Mongolians is also relatively developed. The entire county has achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization, with many of them being joint Mongolian-Han cooperatives. The new socialist ethnic relations have been increasingly consolidated and developed.

The meeting also approved several appointments and removals.

    前郭尔罗斯蒙古族自治县位于吉林省的西部，东邻扶余县，南邻农安县，西邻长岭、开通两县，北邻大赉、乾安两县，是一个土地肥沃草原广阔的地区，面积约七千二百多平方公里，人口有二十万零四千多人，其中有汉族十八万五千多人，蒙古族一万六千多人，此外还有满族、回族、朝鲜族和锡伯族，少数民族人口共一万九千七百多人，占总人口的10％弱，蒙古族人口占总人口的8％强，占少数民族总人口的85％弱。
    自治县原名为郭尔罗斯前旗，在元朝即为蒙古族开辟，四十年前还是纯蒙古族地区，以后汉人才逐渐迁入落户。这个地区旗的建制一直保留着，宪法公布后经过蒙汉人民协商同意于一九五五年十二月三十一日改建为前郭尔罗斯自治县。自治县的经济以农业为主，蒙古族经营的畜牧业也比较发达。全县已实现了农业高级合作化，其中有许多是蒙汉联合社，新的社会主义民族关系已日益巩固发展。
    会议还通过了任免事项多起。
