    Sharing the Same Foul Odor with Liu Shaotang
    Bao Chang's Arrogance, Recklessness, Degeneracy, and Betrayal of the Party

    (By this newspaper) The Tianjin Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles Party Group recently held seven consecutive enlarged meetings to expose and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of Party rightist Bao Chang.

    Bao Chang came from a family of the exploiting class and harbored serious bourgeois individualism. During the anti-Hu Feng struggle in 1955, with the help of the Party, Bao Chang wrote two articles criticizing Hu Feng, and then styled himself a "theoretician," becoming arrogant, complacent, and contemptuous of everyone.

    He and the anti-Party element Liu Shaotang shared an extremely foul odor; they often attacked the Party's literary and artistic policies together and spread anti-Party remarks. They slandered Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," saying that "the problems of 1942 should be re-evaluated."

    During the period of blooming and contending, Bao Chang shamelessly said that his past criticism of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was "blind action." He stated that he could no longer "listen to the Party's words" as he had in the past; he wanted to "think independently."

    After Bao Chang assumed the position of Director of the "New Harbour" editorial department, he wanted to use "New Harbour" as an "independent kingdom" to get rid of the Party's leadership. Under the guise of "cultivating young writers," he attempted to organize a sectarian clique centered on himself, drawing in rightists such as Liu Shaotang to dominate "New Harbour." He never solicited or adopted the opinions of other editorial board members, consistently acting arbitrarily and listening only to the words of Liu Shaotang and others, treating them as "voluntary editorial board members."

    At the meetings, many people revealed that after the Hungarian incident, Bao Chang even slandered the Communist Party as having a "spontaneous tendency to degenerate," and that the Party itself was "unable to overcome it." He also openly advocated that "intellectuals should supervise the Party's political activities."

    和刘绍棠臭味相投
    鲍昌骄横狂妄堕落叛党
    本报讯　中共天津市文联党组最近连续召开了七次扩大会议，揭露并批判党内右派分子鲍昌反党反社会主义的言行。
    鲍昌出身于剥削阶级的家庭，存在着严重的资产阶级个人主义。在1955年反胡风斗争中，鲍昌在党的帮助下，写出了两篇批判胡风的文章，就自命为“理论家”，骄傲自满，目空一切。
    他和反党分子刘绍棠的臭味极其相投，他们经常在一起攻击党的文艺方针，散播反党言论。他们污蔑毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，说什么“1942年的问题应当重新估价”。
    在鸣放期间，鲍昌竟无耻地说，过去他批判胡风反革命集团是“盲动”。他表示他不能再像过去那样“听党的话”了，他要“独立思考”了。
    鲍昌担任“新港”编辑部主任的职务以后，就想把“新港”当作摆脱党的领导的“独立王国”。他打着“培养青年作家”的招牌，企图以他为中心，拉拢刘绍棠等右派分子组织一个宗派小集团，霸占“新港”。他从来不征求或采纳其他编委的意见，一贯独断专行，而把刘绍棠等当作“义务编委”，言听计从。
    会上，许多人揭露，鲍昌在匈牙利事件发生后，竟污蔑共产党有一种“自发的蜕化趋势”，而且党自身是“不能克服的”。他还公然主张要由“知识分子来监督党的政治活动”。
