	New Moon
	One day, this day is not far away, it is right in front of you, you can look up and see its features, reach out and open its happy door;
	We ride the red new moon, sparkling with bright light, like taking an international train from Beijing to Moscow, no, it doesn't take that long, like taking a Moscow subway or a Beijing loop tram;
	Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, we have passed through the clouds, take a breath, and we have passed through space, in a very short time, we have completed the first most outstanding and most amazing journey since the beginning of time;
	All fairy tales, legends, and poems pale in comparison, even if Homer, Qu Yuan, Li Bai, Dante, and Andersen were reborn, they would all feel the poverty of their imagination.
	We land on the moon, knock on the door of the Lunar Palace, and send a letter printed with red stars: reporting that one-third of humanity on Earth has entered socialism, and the footsteps of the communist giants are resounding everywhere, and we are the envoys of socialism-communism creators—Marxism-Leninism;
	The host warmly welcomes us, accepts the red letter, and greets each other. Then, the host allows us to use axes and sickles made by the "October" factory to fulfill Li Bai's grand wish of "wanting to chop the laurel in the moon and hold it as firewood for the cold," cutting down laurel and sago palm branches, and entrusts the lightning-fast rockets to bring them, along with our letter reporting safety, to the happy socialist human beings, just like bringing gifts from relatives' homes or bringing letters from afar.
	However, this is just a station on a long journey, this is just the initial moment when we arrive at another planet, we will travel far, we will stay long, we will film documentaries on the moon, we will invite the residents of the moon to visit the Earth, we will...
	Oh, this is not a fantasy. If you look up at the artificial satellite speeding past the stars in the quiet of midnight, you will discover many realistic scenes that any fantasy cannot reach, and we will uncover them and realize them.

	October
	November 7, 1917, this is not an ordinary day, this is a day that has never appeared in world history, this is the day when human ideals blossomed and bore fruit, this is the birthday of happy human beings in the world.
	On this day, the dark Earth was split in two: one side was still ruled by darkness and pain, and the other side became a paradise of light and happiness; on this day, the vast oppressed and exploited people had hope: a Soviet Union appeared in the world, the freedom, liberation, and happiness of the red star on the Kremlin radiated in all directions, attracting the eyes and hearts of all suffering people living on all continents; on this day, the chains and prisons condensed by capital and feudalism were broken by an important link, and a major gap was opened; and wolf-like capitalists and feudal lords uttered hysterical howls and frantic struggles, sitting on their tottering thrones, vainly dreaming of摘掉removing the red star, repairing the chains and prison walls, and attempting to restore its unified world kingdom of capital and feudal rule that would never return.
	From this day on, the world is moving forward according to the new track discovered and built by Marx and Lenin, the socialist paradise of the Soviet Union is being built; Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki, who set fire to destroy the world, were burned to death, and socialist countries are growing vigorously like bamboo shoots after a rain; Chiang Kai-shek fled in disarray, and my great motherland stood up, rising like the rising sun; the capitalist world collapsed for the most part, and the democratic, peaceful, and socialist camp firmly established itself on the Earth, full of vitality and hope like spring, and incomparably powerful like mountains, making the enemy dare not even move a finger, if it still wants to save its arm.
	This is the day when the Soviet Union launched the first red star, it is flying non-stop in the human world, illuminating people traveling at night; and now, forty years after it flew, the red star has become a huge galaxy, illuminating the socialist march forward, illuminating the growing ranks of defenders of world peace; and at this moment, it has built the intercontinental bridge "Tu-114" aircraft, manufactured intercontinental ballistic missiles to curb war, and created a ladder to the stars—rockets, adding another new moon to the sky, and knocking on the door for mankind to travel to the moon. Soviet Union, the loyal brothers and friends of all the people of the world, what you are creating is not only an amazing undertaking, but an undertaking that amazes the planets!
	Praise you, October, the red moon, the happy moon, the moon of hope and victory. The whole world follows you. And you, even when all mankind enters communism, even when there is mutual exchange between the stars, even after billions of generations, the great October, you will still be the festival of all mankind, and even the moon will hold celebrations on this day, just like the celebrations held today in the Soviet Union and among all working people in the world.

    新月集（散文诗）
　　刘岚山
    新月
    有一天，这一天并不远，它就在你的面前，你抬头就能望见它的眉目，伸手就能推开它那幸福的大门；
    我们乘坐着闪闪发出亮丽光彩的红色新月，就像乘坐一趟从北京到莫斯科的国际列车，不，要不了这多时间，就像乘坐一趟莫斯科的地下火车或北京的环行路电车吧；
    倐忽地，?一下眼睛，已经穿过云层，呼一口气，便已穿过太空，在很短很短的时间里，我们完成了一次自从开天辟地以来的第一次最出色、最奇异的旅行；
    一切的童话、传说和诗都失色了，纵使荷马、屈原、李白、但丁、安徒生再生，也都将感到自己的想像的贫弱。
    我们降落在月亮上，拍拍地叩开月宫的大门，送上去印着红星的信：报道地球上的人类已有三分之一进入社会主义，四处已经响起共产主义巨人前进的脚步声，而我们就是社会主义—共产主义缔造人——马克思列宁主义的使者；
    主人热烈地欢迎我们，收下了红色的信，互相问候。于是，主人让我们用“十月”工厂制造的斧头与镰刀，满足“欲斫月中桂，持为寒者薪”的李白的宏愿，砍伐月桂与桫椤树枝，拜托那来去如闪电的火箭，连同我们报道平安的信件，带给欢乐的社会主义人类，就像从亲戚家带回礼物、从远方捎来家书一样。
    然而，这只是迢迢旅途上的一个驿站，这只是我们抵达另一个星球时最初的一刻，我们还将远行，我们还将久住，我们将要拍摄月亮上的纪录片，我们将要邀请月亮上的居民到地球来访问，我们将要……
    哦，这不是幻想。如果你在更深人静的午夜，仰观从众星列列中急驰而过的人造卫星，你将发现许多为任何幻想还达不到的现实景象，而我们都将把它揭开、把它实现。
    十月
    1917年11月7日，这不是一个普通的日子，这是世界历史上从未出现过的日子，这是人类理想开花结果的日子，这是世界幸福人类的诞辰。
    在这一天，黑暗的地球破裂为二：一边仍然为黑暗与痛苦所统治，另一边则成了光明与幸福的乐园；在这一天，被压迫被剥削的广大人民有了希望：世界上出现了一个苏联，克里姆林宫上红星的自由、解放、幸福的光芒四射，吸引着居住在各大洲上所有苦难人民的眼睛和心灵；在这一天，资本和封建所凝结成的锁链和牢狱，被扭断了重要的一环、被打开了一个重大的缺口；而狼一样的资本家和封建主，则发出歇斯底里的嚎叫和疯狂的挣扎，坐在行将倒塌的宝座上，徒然地梦想摘掉红星、补好锁链和牢墙，企图恢复它那一去不复返的统一的资本与封建统治的世界王国。
    从这一天开始，世界按照马克思列宁所发现、所修造的新轨道前进着，社会主义乐园苏联建设起来了；纵火烧毁世界的希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机被火烧死了，社会主义国家像雨后春笋一样茁壮起来；蒋介石丢盔弃甲而逃，我的伟大祖国站了起来，像朝阳一样冉冉上升上升；资本世界垮了一大半，而民主、和平、社会主义阵营巍然确立在地球上，像春天一样充沛着活力和希望，像山岳一样有无比的雄强，使得敌人不敢伸出手指动一下，如果它还想保全它的手臂。
    这是苏联发射第一颗红星的日子，它在人类世界上飞行不息，照耀着夜行的人们；而现在，当它飞行四十年以后，红星已成为巨大的星群，照耀着社会主义大步行进，照耀着保卫世界和平的队伍日渐壮大；而就在这个时候，它又搭起了洲际桥梁“图—114”飞机，制成了遏止战争的洲际弹道导弹，创造了通往星球的天梯——火箭，为天空添造了另一颗新月，为人类敲开了到月亮上旅行的大门。苏联，全世界人民的忠实兄弟和朋友呵，你正在创造着的不止是惊人的事业，而是惊动星球的事业！
    礼赞你，十月，红色的月，幸福的月，希望的、胜利的月。跟随你而运行的是全世界。而你，即使当全人类进入共产主义之后，即使当星际之间互通有无以后，即使在亿万世代之后，伟大的十月，你也仍将是全人类的节日，甚至月亮上也要在这一天举行庆祝会，就像今天在苏联、在世界一切劳动人民中间所举行的庆祝活动一样。
