The forty years of the Great October Socialist Revolution

Comrades, deputies to the Supreme Soviet! Workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals of the Soviet Union! Our dear foreign guests who have come from all corners of the world to the Soviet Union!

I have the honor, on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Soviet Government, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to convey to you the warmest greetings on this joyous holiday—the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!

Today, we are gathered here in the capital of the Soviet Union with representatives of the Soviet public and foreign guests to commemorate together our great holiday. The fortieth anniversary of October is a day of victory for Soviet socialism, an international holiday for the working people of the whole world.

The October Socialist Revolution has the greatest significance in human history. When the Russian proletariat and the poorest peasants, under the leadership of the great Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin, seized power and proclaimed the birth of a new social and state system, the entire world was shaken to its foundations. The first workers' and peasants' state in the world raised the banner of socialism, illuminated by the glory of struggle and victory, the great banner of Marxism-Leninism.

On the fortieth anniversary of October, the peoples of the Soviet Union have demonstrated to all mankind the historical victory of socialism. Our working class has always considered itself a part of the international working-class movement, seeing its achievements as the victories of the laboring people of all countries, as a contribution to the great cause of liberating mankind from the chains of imperialism and colonialism, to the cause of building a new socialist society.

Our Party, the Soviet people, and all progressive humanity, recalling the historically significant days of the October Revolution, recalling the glorious path of the socialist motherland, remember with deep affection the luminous name of one person—Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. His immortal genius and the unyielding will of a revolutionary fighter have inspired and continue to inspire millions of laborers in the struggle for the victory of communism.

On the occasion of the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of October, Vladimir Ilyich wrote inspiringly:

“We have the right to be proud, and we are proud: we have been so fortunate as to begin to build the Soviet state, thereby beginning a new era in world history, the era of the rule of a new class, which in all capitalist countries is oppressed, and which today, everywhere, is advancing toward new life, toward the victory over the bourgeoisie, toward the dictatorship of the proletariat, toward the final liberation of mankind from the shackles of capital, from imperialist wars.” (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 33, pp. 32-33)

Forty years ago, our homeland, ravaged by the imperialist war, experienced severe economic destruction and stood on the brink of collapse. The policies of the bourgeoisie and landlords had doomed Russia to be divided by the imperialist powers, to become a colony of the Western capitalist countries. The Menshevik Party and the Socialist Revolutionary Party helped the bourgeoisie and landlords carry out this policy of betrayal. Only one party acted as a true patriotic revolutionary force. It reflected the fundamental interests of the working class and laboring peasants, the hopes and aspirations of the entire people. This was the glorious, Leninist Bolshevik Party—the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our time.

Our people, united around the Communist Party, confidently followed the Party forward, opening the way to a happy and bright future for mankind—the way to socialism. This was a new path in history. For the first time, the working class and the laboring people of our country, who had become masters of their own fate, showed unprecedented strength of spirit, heroism, and courage in defending the achievements of socialism, in overcoming difficulties and hardships, in building a new socialist society without a bourgeoisie and against the bourgeoisie.

The imperialists were not reconciled to the victory of the Russian proletarian revolution. They were not reconciled to this victory not only because their plans for the economic enslavement of our country had been frustrated, but primarily because the October Revolution was an example that inspired the proletariat of all capitalist countries and the peoples of the colonies, a destructive blow to the world imperialist system.

The imperialists tried to drag history backward. They forced us into a civil war, they launched armed intervention, intending to strangle the socialist revolution in its cradle by force.

Our peoples defended the gains of October in the severe struggle. The international brigade, composed of comrades from China, Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia, Finland, Romania, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and other countries who were living in Soviet Russia at the time and had revolutionary sentiments, together with the laboring people of Soviet Russia, fought against the enemies of the revolution. In the struggle against the White Guards and the interventionists, the working class and laboring people of various countries gave great support to the young Soviet Republic. Life showed that workers and peasants, once well organized and inspired by socialist ideas, are invincible. After the failure of the imperialist intervention, they again tried to strangle the young Soviet Republic with an economic blockade. But the Soviet people, with the support of the working class and laboring people of all countries, also shattered this treacherous plan of the world reactionaries.

Under conditions of capitalist encirclement, in the unceasing struggle against the intrigues of international imperialism, the laboring people of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party, smashed the desperate resistance of the class enemy and built socialism in a short historical period. They demonstrated to the whole world the great creative power of people freed from the shackles of capitalism, the power unleashed in the great creative labor.

The laboring people of all countries, all progressive humanity, watched with unwavering attention and warm sympathy the unprecedented labor feats achieved by the Soviet people in the first years of the five-year plans, rejoicing in the victory of the Soviet state.

At the same time, the heads of world imperialism were hatching bloody plans to destroy the Soviet Union. In 1941, the imperialists directed their most vicious striking force—Hitler fascism—against our homeland. The war imposed on us by the treacherous attack of the fascist invaders was a severe test of the stability of the Soviet system and the strength and vitality of the socialist state.

The Soviet people and their heroic armed forces bore the main burden of the Second World War. They not only defended the freedom and independence of their own country but also made a decisive contribution to the cause of saving mankind from the threat of fascist slavery. Some people tried to erase or diminish the significance of this victory. But no one has been able to erase from the memory of the people, from history, the great feat of the Soviet people! Not only our contemporaries, but also our descendants will forever remember with sacred reverence the heroic warriors who defeated the fascist bandits in the life-and-death struggle, who saved the bright future of mankind.

The peoples of Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Albania, and later Romania, Bulgaria, and other European countries, together with the Soviet people and their brave armed forces, fought heroically against German fascism. The heroic Chinese people and their glorious People's Liberation Army made a significant contribution to the defeat of Japanese imperialism. The peoples of the United States, Britain, France, and other anti-Hitler coalition countries played a major role in the common struggle of the peace-loving peoples of all countries against Hitler's Germany and Japanese militarism.

Due to the great victory over Hitler fascism and Japanese imperialism in the Second World War, the peoples of a series of countries in Europe and Asia freed themselves from the yoke of capitalist and colonial oppression, took their fate into their own hands, and embarked on the path of building socialism.

The Soviet people have always felt the friendly, brotherly support of the international proletariat, the hundreds of millions of laboring people of the world. Our country was the first to break through the imperialist front in 1917, build socialism, and shatter the war machine of Hitler, thus honorably fulfilling its internationalist duty to the laboring people of all countries, to the international communist and workers' movement, to all progressive forces of the world.

Socialism first achieved victory in one country, the Soviet Union, and is now a powerful world system. We are fortunate and happy that the glorious Communist Party leads six hundred million Chinese people, and the laboring people of various countries build socialism under the leadership of their respective Communist and Workers' Parties.

Today, on the occasion of the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution, all the Soviet people recall with deep gratitude those who, through heroic struggle and selfless labor, won the victory of the socialist revolution, those who fought for the establishment and consolidation of Soviet power, for the strengthening of the might of the socialist motherland and for its prosperity. The peoples of the Soviet Union will forever honorably remember the comrades who sacrificed themselves for the revolutionary cause, for the defense of the fruits of the revolution, for the victory of socialism in our country.

On this significant day, the Soviet people express their heartfelt thanks and respect to the working class and laboring people of all countries who have consistently supported the working class and laboring people of our country in the struggle for socialism and peace.

The celebration today is attended by delegations from the parties and governments of socialist countries and representatives from sixty-one countries of fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties. Also present are representatives from many countries of the world.

I. The Main Summary of the Development of Our Country in the Forty Years of Soviet Power

Comrades!

The main and fundamental question of every revolution is the question of power. In human history, there have been many revolutions, but never before has there been a revolution where the laboring people have triumphed over the ruling classes, never before has there been a revolution that has consolidated the power of the laboring people. Only the October Socialist Revolution has, for the first time in history, solved this question in favor of the laboring people, in favor of the people, thus opening a new era, the era of the victory of socialism and communism.

Almost one hundred and seventy years have passed since the French bourgeois revolution raised the slogans of liberty, equality, and fraternity. However, the bourgeoisie, during its struggle for power, never intended to implement these slogans. It was precisely in France that the working class and the laboring masses repeatedly rose up against bourgeois rule and, in 1871, established the glorious Paris Commune, the first attempt by the working class and the laboring people to build their own power and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. The reactionary forces of the bourgeoisie drowned the Paris Commune in the blood of the workers. In this brutal suppression, the bourgeoisie showed its bestial hatred for the working class. When the rule of the French bourgeoisie was threatened, the French bourgeoisie, fearing the uprising of the people, forgot its internal disputes, forgot its enmity with the Prussian militarists, and united with the German reactionary forces, and German troops were sent to suppress the Paris Commune. This historical fact vividly shows that as soon as the working class attempts to build power, the bourgeoisie of all countries unite their forces to fight against the revolutionary proletariat. But no bloody suppression could destroy the indomitable will of the laboring masses to free themselves from the shackles of capitalism. In the struggle of the working class and the laboring people of various countries, the Paris Commune became an inspiring example of revolutionary heroism.

When the Russian working class fought for its liberation, it drew lessons from the revolutionary movements within the country and from other countries. As Vladimir Ilyich Lenin vividly put it, Russia, after half a century of unprecedented suffering and sacrifice, of unparalleled revolutionary heroism, of incredible perseverance, and of selfless seeking, learning, and practice, of disappointment, examination, and comparison with European experience, truly experienced that Marxism is the only correct revolutionary theory.

The Communist Party, which united all the most advanced and revolutionary people, was born and strengthened in the revolutionary struggle of the working class, and was tempered. Under the leadership of this party, the laboring people of Russia went through the revolutionary storms of 1905 and February 1917, and completed the October Socialist Revolution, which forever ended social and national oppression in our country. The October Revolution established Soviet power, liberated the peoples of our country, and laid the foundation for the true equality and brotherhood of all nations.

Marxism-Leninism teaches us that as long as there are exploiting and exploited classes in the world, there can be no true equality. The great significance of the October Revolution lies in the fact that it led to the victory of socialism, building a society that eliminated the exploiting class and the phenomenon of man exploiting man.

Some attack us, Marxists who stand on the position of class struggle, saying that we are cruel, for example, they insist that the October Revolution sacrificed many people. In fact, the overthrow of the bourgeois government in October 1917, although it was carried out through an armed uprising of workers and soldiers, did not result in much bloodshed. Historical documents show that the number of casualties in the battle for the Winter Palace was insignificant. Everyone also knows that the working class, after the victory of the revolution, showed great magnanimity and humanity, even some leaders who participated in the counter-revolutionary rebellion, such as Krasnov, were released in 1917. The representatives of capitalism probably regarded this leniency as a sign of the weakness of the proletarian revolution. The overthrown class gathered armed forces and marched against Soviet power, instigating a civil war in the Soviet Union. The well-armed armies of imperialist Germany, Britain, France, the United States, Japan, and other countries supported the counter-revolutionary rebellion in our country. The Russian working class, remembering the lessons of the Paris Commune, the 1905 revolution, and the February 1917 revolution, had to take up arms to defend their revolutionary gains.

Therefore, the culprits of the continuous and extremely fierce wars during the years of the civil war and foreign intervention were not the Bolsheviks, nor the working class and the laboring people, but the exploiting class that was overthrown by the revolution and the world capitalist reactionary forces. The October Revolution was the most humane revolution because it freed millions of laboring people from the shackles of the exploiters, liberated the peoples of Russia from the yoke of national oppression, mobilized the broadest masses of the people to conscious creation, and established the highest form of democracy—socialist democracy, the democracy of the laboring people, the democracy of all the people.

When the October Revolution took away the means of production from the exploiters and turned them into public property, the bourgeoisie loudly proclaimed that the laboring people were incapable of managing the state, incapable of developing social production. This shameless lie has burst like a soap bubble!

The forty-year experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union convincingly proves the incomparable superiority of free labor over forced labor, of labor for oneself over labor for the exploiters, of planned economic development over the anarchy of production and the pursuit of maximum profit. Socialist construction has greatly increased the initiative of millions of laboring people. This is particularly evident in the all-people socialist competitions.

In the extremely difficult and complex work of socialist construction, the Communist Party and the Soviet government, guided by Lenin's wise plan for socialist construction, consistently implemented the party's general line of national industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and cultural revolution.

This was the only correct path. Only by establishing our own powerful industry could our country, surrounded by capitalism, consolidate the victory of the proletarian revolution, ensure its independence, and successfully solve the tasks of developing the national economy on the basis of technical reconstruction. Only by implementing the collectivization of small peasant economies and establishing large-scale socialist agriculture could the majority of the population, who were peasants, be freed from centuries of poverty, and they could be actively involved in the construction of the new life. Only by realizing the cultural revolution could the serious legacy of illiteracy and ignorance of tsarist Russia be eliminated, all scientific and cultural achievements be made to serve the people, and a truly new generation of intellectuals be trained, ensuring the powerful development of science and culture.

This was a difficult path. In the struggle to achieve the great goal of building socialism, high organizational discipline, iron discipline, creative initiative, and self-sacrifice were needed. The working class, which had shown amazing heroism in the revolutionary struggle for power, also showed all these noble qualities in the creative labor of building socialism, inspiring millions of peasant masses and all the Soviet people with their inspiring example. Our laboring people, fearless of difficulties and shortages, built a powerful industry equipped with modern technology in an unprecedentedly short period.

The tasks of socialist construction were successfully accomplished because the Communist Party and the Soviet government, in all their activities, relied on the unbreakable alliance of the working class and the peasants, an alliance that, according to Lenin, is the most amazing force in the world.

In the Soviet Union, due to the implementation of Lenin's national policy, the friendship of the nations was strengthened, and the task of eliminating economic and cultural inequality among the nations was solved for the first time in history. Powerful modern industries were established in each union republic, cadres of workers and intellectuals of the nations were trained, and national forms of culture with socialist content were developed comprehensively.

During the first few five-year plans, our country transformed from an economically backward country into a powerful industrial-collective farm country—a monolithic bastion of socialism. The strength of the Soviet Union in that period is clearly demonstrated by the victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War! In that war, the Soviet system withstood a severe test and became even stronger and more consolidated.

The distinctive feature of the post-war period of Soviet life is the new achievements in the development of the economy and culture, the improvement of the welfare of the people. After healing the wounds of war, our country advanced at an even faster pace.

The achievements of our country in the economic field during the years of Soviet power can be briefly illustrated by the following materials:

The production of steel increased from 420 million tons in 1913 to 5,100 million tons in 1957. In 1913, our country produced less pig iron by one-third than Britain and also less than France, but now, we produce more pig iron than the combined production of Britain, France, and Belgium.

Currently, the Soviet Union ranks first in Europe and second in the world in coal mining, and third in the world in oil production. Compared to 1913, coal production increased from 291 million tons to 4.62 billion tons in 1957, and oil production increased from 92 million tons to 980 million tons. Just last year, the increase in oil production alone was almost equal to one and a half times the annual oil production of pre-revolutionary Russia.

Electric power generation increased from 19 billion kilowatt-hours in 1913 to 2,100 billion kilowatt-hours in 1957. Just the Kuybyshev hydroelectric station, which was fully commissioned before the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, generates five times more electricity annually than all the power stations in Russia in 1913. The share of electric power equipment received by industrial workers increased twentyfold during the years of Soviet power. All cities, almost all workers' settlements, and more than one-third of collective farms are already electrified.

As for the machine-building industry, which is the basis for the technical progress of all sectors of the national economy, it is enough to mention that the production of machine-building and metalworking in the Soviet Union has increased more than two hundred times compared to 1913.

In 1957, the total industrial production of the Soviet Union increased thirty-three times compared to 1913, with the production of means of production increasing to seventy-four times. When studying these materials on the development of the Soviet economy, it should be noted that in the forty years of the existence of the Soviet state, almost twenty years were spent on the war imposed on us and the subsequent restoration of the national economy. Therefore, the rapid rise of Soviet industry to such a powerful level actually did not take forty years, but only twenty to twenty-two years.

To illustrate how serious the difficulties were for the economic development and improvement of the material well-being of the people caused by the military adventures of the imperialists against the Soviet Union, it is enough to mention the following materials. The treacherous attack by Hitler's Germany caused the Soviet national economy to suffer losses (including military expenditures and temporary losses in industrial and agricultural production in the occupied regions) amounting to 256.9 billion rubles. If this huge sum had been invested in peaceful construction—building various factories, railways, power stations, housing, and increasing the production of consumer goods, we would have had abundant material resources long ago.

Nevertheless, the Soviet economy continued to develop smoothly. The rapid development of the Soviet Union in industrial production, especially in heavy industry, which is the foundation of the entire economy, is unprecedented in history. To increase industrial production by approximately thirty times, it took eighty to one hundred and fifty years in the United States, Germany, and Britain.

In terms of absolute industrial production, the Soviet Union has long surpassed the largest capitalist countries in Europe, such as Britain, France, and West Germany. Now, the Soviet Union is successfully solving the task of catching up and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in per capita production in a short historical period, including the United States.

Lenin repeatedly emphasized that labor productivity is of decisive importance for the victory of the new social system. Before the revolution, the labor productivity of Russia was many times lower than that of the United States and was also significantly lower than that of Britain and France. Now, in terms of labor productivity, the Soviet Union has surpassed Britain and France and is about to catch up with the United States. Compared to 1913, the annual labor productivity of Soviet industry has increased to approximately 9.5 times, while in the United States, it has only increased to 2.3 times. It is important to note the following fact: our labor productivity has increased on the basis of the widespread application of scientific and technological achievements, mechanization, and the improvement of working conditions.

The rapid development of industry, especially heavy industry, is the key to the socialist transformation of agriculture.

Lenin's plan for collectivization pointed out the only correct path to solving the most difficult task of the proletarian revolution after seizing power. The victory of the collective farm system turned the Soviet Union into the largest agricultural producer in the world. All Soviet farmers have joined collective farms, and now there are about 80,000 collective farms in the country. There are 5,800 state farms—large socialist enterprises that own about 55 million hectares of arable land, which is nearly 25% of the total arable land in the country. Socialist agriculture has a powerful material and technical base. On the fields of collective farms and state farms, there are 1,632,000 tractors (each with 15 horsepower), 420,000 grain harvesters, nearly 660,000 trucks, and millions of other complex agricultural machines.

As a result of the socialist transformation of agriculture and the modernization of agricultural technology, the labor productivity of agriculture has been greatly improved. The proportion of the population engaged in agriculture has decreased by about half compared to the pre-revolutionary period, while the production of commercial agricultural products has increased several times. Compared to the best harvest year before the revolution, 1913, the production of commercial grain has almost tripled, with wheat increasing fivefold, commercial cotton, sunflowers, and vegetables increasing sixfold, sugar beets, and potatoes almost tripling.

Since the September Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU in 1953, the party and the government have been implementing a grand program to sharply increase agricultural production. The strengthening of the material and technical base of agriculture, the cultivation of virgin lands, the strengthening of the leadership of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, the improvement of the material interests of agricultural workers in increasing agricultural production, the establishment of new agricultural planning methods, and other measures have great significance. Now, agriculture is confidently accelerating its development.

Allow me to list some materials that illustrate the situation of agricultural development in recent years. In 1957, the total sown area of the Soviet Union was 193.2 million hectares, which is 75 million hectares more than in 1913. This achievement itself is outstanding, but it is even more noteworthy that in the entire period of Soviet power, about half of the increase in sown area (36 million hectares) has been added in the past four years.

Due to the expansion of the sown area and the increase in yield per unit area, the total harvest and procurement of agricultural products have increased rapidly. Here are some indicators. As of November 1, 1957, the state's procurement and purchase of grain was 120% of the same period in 1953, with wheat at 143%, sugar beets at 175%, potatoes at 148%, and vegetables at 179%. The procurement and purchase of livestock were 148% of the same period in 1953, with pork at 304%, milk and dairy products at 190%, wool at 142%, and eggs at 165%. In the first ten months of 1957, state industrial enterprises produced 234,000 tons more animal oil than in the same period in 1953, an increase of 68%.

Indeed, due to droughts in some regions of the country, especially in the Volga region, the Urals, and some provinces of Kazakhstan, the state's grain harvest this year will be less than last year. Despite the drought, due to the cultivation of virgin lands, the state still has the necessary amount of grain. As for the role of virgin lands in the national economy, it can be illustrated by the following facts. As of November 1, 1957, the grain procured in the virgin land cultivation areas (excluding substitutes) reached 10.21 billion poods, while in 1953, the entire year in these places only procured 6.18 billion poods; in the Siberian region, these two years were 6.45 billion poods and 2.47 billion poods, respectively; in the Altai Territory alone, there were about 2.8 billion poods, while in 1953, the entire year was 290 million poods. From this, we can draw the conclusion that the task of cultivating virgin lands proposed by the party is in line with the fundamental interests of our people and the interests of communist construction.

Livestock farming has long been one of the most backward sectors of agriculture. Due to the measures taken by the party, the situation has changed. In October 1953, the number of cattle was only 4.6 million head higher than the pre-revolutionary level of Russia, but in the following three years, it increased by 7.4 million head, and in October 1956, it was 12 million head higher than the pre-revolutionary level. With the increase in the number of livestock, the productivity of livestock products has also increased significantly. Compared to 1913, the production of commercial meat has doubled, dairy products have tripled, wool has tripled, and fine and semi-fine wool has almost quintupled.

Advanced collective farms and state farms, after carefully considering the possibilities and prospects for further developing livestock farming, have ensured a significant increase in the production of livestock products and called on agricultural workers to fight to catch up with the United States in the production of meat, dairy, and oil per capita in the next few years. This call, supported by the Central Committee of the Party, has greatly increased the initiative of agricultural workers, and this call has received the unanimous support of the entire Soviet people.

When the movement to achieve this task was launched in our country, bourgeois newspapers and magazines said that this task was unrealistic, that we were only doing it for propaganda, etc. However, life and the practice of collective farms and state farms have exposed these slanderous fabrications. The results of the development of livestock farming this year have further strengthened the confidence that this task can be accomplished. Look, how enthusiastically the advanced collective farms and districts of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Moldavia, and other republics and provinces are fighting for the development of livestock farming. For example, the collective farms of the Chadiir-Lunga district of the Moldavian Republic produced an average of 34 poods of meat per 100 hectares of land in 1956, while in the first ten months of this year, they produced 66.6 poods. The Moldavian collective farms, by November 1, 1957, had sold almost twice as much meat to the state as in the same period last year, and also ensured a further increase in the number of livestock. The collective farms of the Kremenchug district of the Vinnytsia region produced an average of 38 poods of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land in 1956, while in the first ten months of this year, they produced 101 poods, which is twice as much as last year. The Lenin collective farm of the Volna district of the Chuvash Autonomous Region increased the production of meat per 100 hectares of land from 49 poods in 1956 to 110 poods in the first ten months of 1957.

Look, with the rational use of the potential and advantages of socialist agriculture, how much can be achieved in a year. There are many such examples that can prove that the task of significantly increasing the production of livestock products in the next few years can be successfully completed.

Comrades, the achievements of the Soviet Union have dispelled the myth spread by our enemies that the Bolshevik revolution can only destroy, even ruin, civilization. The forty-year experience of our country convincingly shows that the people who have seized power are the most diligent masters, the tireless creators of ever-increasing material and spiritual wealth. This experience shows that only under the socialist system, in all spheres of social and personal life, can there be rapid, truly mass, and all-people's progress, continuous advancement in material production, and unprecedented flourishing of science and culture. The liberation of women and their active participation in social activities is one of the outstanding achievements of the socialist revolution. Soviet women have made great contributions to the national economy and cultural construction in various fields with their creative labor for the struggle to achieve the victory of communism, for the education of the new generation.

Socialism has opened up boundless prospects for the development of productive forces, continuously improving the material well-being of the people. The growth of national income is the most comprehensive proof of this. Per capita, the national income of the Soviet Union has increased thirteen times compared to 1913. In this period, the per capita national income of the United States has increased to less than twice its original amount, while that of Britain and France has increased to only 1.6 times more.

The victory of Soviet socialism has forever eliminated such disasters for the laboring people as unemployment. The number of workers employed in the national economy of our country has increased from 12.9 million in 1913 to 52.6 million in 1957, which is more than four times. The socialist revolution not only declared but also actually guaranteed the right to labor, education, and rest for all citizens of our country. The care of the new generation and the old generation who have honestly worked for the people and for socialism is a typical feature of this most humane socialist society.

To implement the resolutions of the Twentieth Party Congress, the party has taken measures such as raising the wages of low-wage workers and shortening the working day before holidays and rest days. The resolutions of the party and the government on the transition to a seven-hour working day, and to a six-hour working day in underground work in the coal and mining industries, are being implemented. In recent years, the scale of housing construction has been greatly expanded.

The Soviet state annually allocates large sums of money for social insurance, subsidies, pensions, and scholarships, for free education and medical care, etc. Just this year, the funds allocated for these purposes exceeded 192 billion rubles, accounting for about one-third of the total state budget expenditure. The laboring people warmly welcome the new state pension law.

The improvement of the material well-being of the Soviet people is reflected in the growth of consumption and the development of Soviet trade. Our laboring people have the opportunity to purchase more and more various goods, and their clothing, food, and housing have greatly improved.

In 1957, the sales of state and cooperative trade increased to 3.3 times for meat and meat products, 3.5 times for animal oil, milk, and other dairy products, 3.3 times for sugar, 2.8 times for textiles, of which the sales of woolen textiles increased almost four times, and silk textiles increased nine times compared to 1940. In 1956, the people bought more than 2.1 million watches, more than 300,000 bicycles, 420 million radios and televisions, and this year, the sales of these goods will be even more.

In recent years, industry has begun to produce more sewing machines, refrigerators, washing machines, and vacuum cleaners.

The realization of the cultural revolution is a great achievement of socialism, due to which the scientific and technological development of our country is in the forefront of the world. As early as before the Second World War, our country had basically eliminated illiteracy. Currently, the number of people receiving various educations in the Soviet Union exceeds 50 million. Only the number of students in higher and secondary technical schools currently exceeds 4 million, while in 1914, there were only 182,000. Currently, there are more than 6 million specialists with higher and secondary specialized education working in various sectors of the national economy, which is almost thirty-three times that of pre-revolutionary Russia. The army of engineers and technicians, agronomists and livestock specialists, teachers, doctors, and other specialists is actively participating in the great cause of communist construction. Great achievements have been made in the development of literature and art. Writers and artists are one of the advanced detachments of our intelligentsia, actively fighting for the victory of the great communist ideal, for the education of new people—the builders of communist society.

In summarizing the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, we should especially thank the Soviet scientists for their fruitful work, who have enriched our homeland and all mankind with inventions and discoveries of great world significance. It is impossible to list all the outstanding achievements of Soviet scientists here. I will only mention that our country is in the most advanced position in the peaceful use of the enormous power of atomic energy, and recently we successfully conducted tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles.

The creation and successful launch of the world's first artificial Earth satellite on October 4, 1957, is the pinnacle of scientific and technological achievements. Less than a month later, the second Soviet satellite was launched into the universe. It is equipped with more advanced scientific instruments and carries experimental animals. Now our first satellite will no longer feel lonely in the universe. Two messengers of the Soviet Union—two stars of peace—are orbiting the Earth. Our scientists, designers, engineers, technicians, and workers have realized the bold ideals of mankind, and on the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, they have inspired the Soviet people with a truly great gift. The achievements of the socialist state in the development of science and technology, which mark a new era, have indeed shocked the whole world.

Friends from all over the world are excited and sincerely congratulate the Soviet scientists, technicians, and workers of our industrial departments for their extremely great achievements. At the same time, this victory of the Soviet Union has caused fear and panic among the enemies of socialism, who are convinced that since the Soviet Union can successfully solve such complex scientific and technological problems, the Soviet Union has raised its scientific and technological and industrial level to such a height.

In the past, the United States announced that they were ready to launch an artificial Earth satellite named "Pioneer." Not named anything else, but precisely "Pioneer"! We also announced that we intended to launch an artificial Earth satellite. Now everyone can see that the creative efforts of Soviet science and technology have been successful. After the appearance of the small "Soviet Moon," some American statesmen declared that they had never intended to compete with the Soviet Union in the manufacture of satellites. Now, when our two satellites are orbiting the Earth, they say this. Obviously, the name "Pioneer" reflects the confidence of the Americans that their satellite would be the first in the world. However, actual life has shown that the leader, the pioneer, is the Soviet satellite. Our satellites are orbiting the Earth and waiting for the satellites of the United States and other countries to appear beside them, forming a family of satellites. Such a family, such a competition, is much better than the arms race, much better than the competition to produce destructive weapons.

The Soviet scientists and technicians and our industrial workers who contributed their genius and creative labor to the manufacture of the first batch of artificial Earth satellites have won the respect of the entire nation and the heartfelt gratitude of all those who cherish the progress and prosperity of science. Allow me, on behalf of the party and the government, from this high platform, to warmly congratulate them on their outstanding victory and express our deep gratitude!

Comrades, the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union is the main achievement of the great October Revolution.

Socialist society is a new type of society in human history, unprecedented. The Soviet society has no mutually hostile classes. This society, due to the unity of interests and the commonality of goals, is united into a whole, and it is closely united around its vanguard—the Communist Party. Our party has grown, strengthened, and developed in the struggle against those things that are incompatible and hostile to Marxism and the class interests of the proletariat. The entire history of the party shows that if the party does not wage an uncompromising struggle against the Mensheviks, Socialist Revolutionaries, anarchists, Trotskyites, rightists, bourgeois nationalists, and other enemies of Marxism-Leninism, if it does not smash these enemies ideologically and politically, the party cannot fulfill the role of the leader of the socialist revolution, cannot fulfill the role of the organizer and inspirer of the socialist victory in our country.

From the very first days after the victory of the October Revolution, the Communist Party, led by its founder and leader—the great Lenin—guided the Soviet people to fully defend the gains of October, implement the plan for socialist construction, and strengthen the might of the Soviet state. After the death of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the party united around the Central Committee of the party led by J. V. Stalin, consistently and resolutely implemented Lenin's plans, leading our country from one victory to another. Under the leadership of the party, the Soviet people implemented the national industrialization and agricultural collectivization of the state, built a socialist society, and achieved a victory of world historical significance in the Great Patriotic War. Due to these victories, our homeland has become a powerful socialist state and has further enhanced its international prestige.

The Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is an important historical stage in the development of the Soviet state towards communism, in the life of the party and the Soviet people. Our entire nation and all the Soviet people enthusiastically welcome the resolutions of the Twentieth Congress, enthusiastically welcome the communist construction plan formulated by the congress, and work with greater creative enthusiasm to implement these resolutions and plans. In recent times, the activities of the labor deputies of the Soviets have become significantly more active, and their role in leading economic and cultural construction has been enhanced. The Soviet trade unions are playing a greater role in mobilizing the creative initiative of the masses and more broadly involving the laboring people in the management of production. The Leninist Young Communist League is doing great and effective work, consistently responding to the calls of our party, showing initiative and creativity in all sectors of communist construction. The characteristic of this period after the Twentieth Congress is that new great achievements have been made in the development of our country.

The Twentieth Party Congress, in analyzing the path we have traveled and drawing up future plans, has shown a high degree of Marxist-Leninist principle and intolerance of existing shortcomings and errors, raising the Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism to a new height, setting an example of solving the tasks of the current stage of communist construction with a creative attitude. The party congress gave a principled criticism of the errors related to the personality cult of J. V. Stalin and proposed measures to eliminate the consequences of the personality cult. The party congress criticized the personality cult based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, based on V. I. Lenin's critical opinions about the shortcomings of J. V. Stalin and some negative traits in his character (these shortcomings and negative traits of Stalin were especially pronounced in his later years, causing serious damage to our common cause). This criticism and the extensive work done by the party to eliminate the consequences of the personality cult have improved the work of the Communist Party, ensured the thorough implementation of Lenin's principle of collective leadership and the norms of party life, ensured the strict observance of revolutionary legality, further developed party democracy and Soviet democracy, improved ideological work, and greatly increased the creative initiative and activity of the broad laboring masses.

Our party, at the Twentieth Congress, took the initiative to criticize the errors of Stalin. The purpose of launching such criticism is first to correct these errors, second to ensure that these errors are never repeated, and third to prevent the treatment of Marxism-Leninism in a dogmatic and pedantic manner, to ensure that it is treated creatively, while strictly maintaining the purity of our great scientific socialist theory.

We Communists criticize the personality cult because we believe it is incompatible with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and is an intolerable phenomenon within the Communist Party and socialist society. The party does this to consolidate its positions, strengthen the socialist system, and never allow such a phenomenon to occur again. However, we cannot agree with those who try to use the criticism of the personality cult to attack the socialist system, to attack the Communist Party. On the one hand, the party criticizes the incorrect aspects of Stalin's activities, and on the other hand, the party will always fight against those who slander Stalin and, under the pretext of criticizing the personality cult, incorrectly describe and distort the entire historical period of the party's activities under the leadership of the Central Committee led by Stalin. As loyal Marxist-Leninists and steadfast revolutionaries, Stalin will occupy his rightful place in history, and our party and the Soviet people will remember Stalin and give him the evaluation he deserves.

Some "critics" are trying in every way to slander this period of the party's struggle, to slander the broad path laid by the Soviet Union in the struggle for socialism. They call those who have worked tirelessly for the people's interests and the cause of socialism in the past and present Stalinists and make this word a term of abuse. They try to discredit and damage the reputation of the Communists and Workers' Party activists who are loyal to the cause of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. Such "critics" are either notorious slanderers or have fallen into the swamp of revisionism, trying to cover up their deviation from the principles of Marxism-Leninism under the guise of criticism of "Stalinism." It is no coincidence that the imperialist propaganda machine uses the provocative slogans of opposition to "Stalinism" and "Stalinists" as weapons.

The party has and will continue to resolutely fight against all deviations from Marxism-Leninism, against any attempt to distort the essence of Marxism-Leninism, against all those who want to weaken our will in the struggle for socialism and communism, destroy our unity, and undermine us.

Only a strong, Marxist-Leninist party that believes in the people and has an inseparable connection with the people, that has gained the unlimited trust and support of the people, can take the bold step of directly and openly criticizing the shortcomings and errors related to the personality cult. Is there any ruling party in a capitalist country that can do this? There is none! On the contrary, they all try to hide and cover up the shortcomings and errors in their activities, to whitewash the incurable defects and diseases of capitalism, to deceive the laboring people with various deceptive theories of "class peace" and "harmony" in bourgeois society.

The working class, as a revolutionary class rising like the sun, does not need to hide and whitewash the shortcomings and errors in the construction of the new life. V. I. Lenin emphasized,

"The proletariat is not afraid to admit in the course of the revolution what it has done well and what it has not done well. All the revolutionary parties that have perished have perished precisely because they were arrogant, unable to see their own strength, afraid to speak of their weaknesses. But we will not perish because we are not afraid to speak of our weaknesses and can learn to overcome them." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 33, p. 278)

Our party has always followed Lenin's norms of party life, constantly improving forms and methods, improving work styles, and consistently implementing the principles of collective leadership and party democracy at all levels from top to bottom.

Marxist dialectics teaches that all development is realized through the exposure and resolution of contradictions. Under the conditions of the capitalist system, the antagonistic classes are mutually contradictory, and these contradictions are of an irreconcilable nature, and can only be resolved through class struggle. In the initial stage of building socialism, when the remnants of the exploiting class (capitalists, landlords, and kulaks) still exist, when they still have some influence at home and are supported by foreign counter-revolutionary forces, class struggle may become acute, and contradictions may become antagonistic.

A socialist society united by high spiritual and political unity, which no longer has an exploiting class, but only the laboring people—the friendly classes of workers and peasants—has fundamentally different contradictions. Here, the contradictions are basically those of development and difficulties, which arise due to the rapid rise of the socialist economy, due to the improvement of the material and cultural needs of the people, which are the contradictions between the new and the old, between the advanced and the backward. These are contradictions that arise because the material and technical base of socialist society cannot yet satisfy the growing needs of its members. The forty-year experience of the Soviet state shows that socialist society itself successfully resolves these contradictions through the rapid and continuous development of the material and technical base of socialism and communism, through the improvement of the socialist consciousness of the laboring people.

The Soviet society is developing at a vigorous pace. At a certain stage of development, it is necessary to improve and improve the forms of leadership of this or that aspect of socialist construction. The entire activity of our party shows that it is resolutely fighting against conservatism and backwardness, that it has repeatedly abandoned outdated forms and established new forms that meet the requirements of moving forward.

The entire practical activity of the party is always vigorous, forward-looking, and is a concrete manifestation of revolutionary Marxism-Leninism. The resolutions of the Twentieth Party Congress, the various measures taken by the party in recent years to rapidly develop agriculture, to reorganize the leadership of industry and construction, are examples of how to deal with things.

The policy of the Communist Party has received the unanimous support of the entire Soviet people, which is convincingly shown in: the resolution of the June Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the anti-party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, and Shepilov, which received the unanimous and enthusiastic support of the people, because this group opposed the line adopted by the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU, attempted to undermine the Leninist unity of our party. After the party and the people eliminated this anti-party group, they united their ranks even more closely, confidently and resolutely moving forward along the only correct Leninist path towards the great goal—the construction of a communist society.

The entire forty-year experience of the Soviet state teaches us that without a united, rock-solid party, without a party armed with the knowledge of the laws of social development, without a party loyal to the great principles of Marxism-Leninism, the working class, laboring peasants, and all the people of our country could not seize power, smash their enemies, build a socialist society, and smoothly transition to communism. In the future, we will continue to protect the Leninist unity of our glorious party like the apple of our eye, strengthen its connection with the people, and continue to hold high the great, invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism!

The peoples of the Soviet Union are closely united around their tried and tested vanguard—the Communist Party. The inseparable unity of the party and the people in the struggle for communism is the guarantee of future achievements of the Soviet state.

II. The Prospects and Tasks of Communist Construction in the Soviet Union

Comrades! In summarizing the development of the Soviet state over forty years, our people confidently look to the future, clearly seeing the prospects of communist construction. The Communist Party follows the instructions of Lenin: in politics, one should always look forward, not backward.

The Soviet state is now at a new stage in its historical development. We have created favorable conditions here for the transition to a higher stage of communist construction, all material and spiritual prerequisites. The Soviet people consider these conditions and prerequisites as the base and foundation for further rapid advancement and future greater victories. Every achievement of socialism is a step forward toward the highest stage of communist society.

The genius leader and teacher of the international proletariat, Marx and Engels, in explaining the future society, said that the future society in its development will have two stages, the first stage is socialism, and the second, higher stage is communism. If socialism, as the first stage of society emerging from within capitalism, had to consider the conditions it inherited from the past and still bore the "birthmarks of capitalism," then communism is developed on the basis it created after the victory of socialism. Marx taught us that only "when labor is no longer merely a means of subsistence but itself has become the first necessity of life; when the development of each is the condition for the development of all; when the productive forces associated with the all-round development of the individual are developed to the highest degree, and the springs of common wealth flow in full abundance," society can complete the transition to the higher stage of communism. (Marx and Engels, Selected Works, Vol. 2, p. 15)

Lenin creatively developed Marxism and concretized the theory of socialism and communism. He formulated the plan for communist construction in our country, in which he especially emphasized that the foundation of the socialist economic base and the general line of the state's development along the path of communism should be: the establishment of a powerful socialist industry and the electrification of the entire country, the collectivization of agriculture, the continuous improvement of social labor productivity on the basis of the use of new technology and the development of socialist competition, the implementation of the cultural revolution.

Even in the days when the state was destroyed and starving, when many people thought that the young Soviet Republic was almost hopeless, under these extremely difficult conditions, our party proposed a bold and grandiose plan for the electrification of the entire country, which opened up a bright prospect for the development of the state in the following decades. At that time, Lenin said that communism is the Soviet power plus the electrification of the entire country. Lenin's definition reflected the essence of the Marxist view of communist construction; the question of the material production base of communism and the political form of the state power that has the mission of realizing the transition from capitalism to communism are inseparably united.

The Marxist-Leninist understanding of communism is inseparably linked to the living practice of the people in the socialist transformation of society. The formula of true, scientific, and vigorous communism—the formula of communism that is not dogmatic communism from books—differs from those beautiful words in that these formulas consider the more perfect organization of socialist production, the working and living conditions of workers and peasants, the increase in the production of goods necessary for improving the welfare of the people, the relationships of people in the labor process and daily life as having decisive significance.

Now, when the Soviet Union, after forty years of development, has achieved outstanding achievements in the improvement of the national economy, science, technology, and culture and has already built socialism, we have every reason to announce that communism is no longer a distant future, the magnificent edifice of communism is becoming increasingly clear before the eyes of the peoples, it is constantly rising, and will take on a more perfect form with every achievement of the workers, peasants, and intelligentsia of our multinational state in their labor.

The program for economic and cultural construction formulated by the Twentieth Party Congress is a big step forward in advancing all sectors of the national economy. This program is being successfully implemented. Everyone knows that the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet government recently adopted a resolution to draft the long-term plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union for 1959-1965. The completion of this plan will undoubtedly bring us closer to solving the basic economic tasks—catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in the production of goods per capita in the shortest historical period.

On what basis can the Soviet people deeply believe that the plan to further greatly develop our national economy can be successfully implemented?

This confidence is justified: first, the Soviet state now has a technically advanced powerful socialist industry and a thriving large-scale mechanized agriculture.

Second, we now have highly qualified cadres who can improve technology, continuously increase social labor productivity, continuously improve economic indicators in industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture, and successfully solve the most complex tasks of developing the national economy.

Third, due to the outstanding achievements of Soviet science and technology and the more extensive application of these achievements in production, we can achieve the greatest results in the development of productive forces with the least labor and capital.

Fourth, our country has inexhaustible natural resources and can develop the economy infinitely. We have all the necessary conditions to rapidly develop various sectors of the national economy and to more fully satisfy the growing needs of society.

Fifth, the existence of the world socialist system, the close cooperation and mutual assistance of the socialist countries, and the coordination of their economic development plans contribute to the most rapid development of the countries of the socialist camp.

These are the basic factors that make the Soviet people, who have deep patriotic enthusiasm and therefore love their socialist homeland infinitely, believe that the grand plan for building communism will be successfully implemented, just like all the plans previously formulated by the Communist Party.

More effective use of our country's existing resources is an important link in the actual implementation of the long-term plan for the development of the national economy.

In pre-revolutionary Russia, mineral deposits were hardly ever explored, and the explored reserves of iron and coal mines accounted for only about 3% of the world's reserves. The capitalists and landlords did a poor job in managing the state, and although the country had rich resources, it had to import coal, phosphate fertilizers, potash, building stones, and paving stones from other countries.

In the Soviet era, many new mineral deposits have been discovered and explored, and the reserves in previously known mineral deposits have also increased significantly. Many important mineral raw materials, including iron, manganese, coal, copper, bauxite, nickel, tungsten, lead, mercury, mica, zinc, potash, etc., the Soviet Union's reserves are the largest in the world. In terms of oil reserves, the Soviet Union is also at the forefront. Our country has rich water resources and can build large-scale hydroelectric power stations in various places, and our forest resources are also abundant.

When talking about the natural wealth of our homeland, we should point out such an advantage: these natural resources are found in various regions of the Soviet Union, have been studied, and are being further explored. From the perspective of our future, as long as productive forces are rationally allocated and the economy of each region is vigorously developed, the magnificent new face of our country will clearly emerge in the future. This will be an important condition for the coordinated development of the Soviet society along the path of communism.

Let us imagine the map of the Soviet Union!

Let's take the Russian Federation as an example. Look at the Far East and the Northeast regions! In the days of the tsarist Russia, these were remote, desolate, and uninhabited regions, economically and culturally backward, often called the "bear's den" of the wilderness. Now, these regions are engaged in great creative work, establishing large industrial and cultural centers. Here, new scientific centers—branches of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Siberia—are being established. Recently, many mineral deposits have been discovered here, including huge tin, molybdenum, iron, coal, magnesite, and other deposits. In the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, coal deposits with reserves of tens of billions of tons have been discovered, extremely rich deposits of native and alluvial diamonds, as well as huge iron, gold, tin, and other mineral deposits.

In the middle of our large economic regions, the Urals occupy an important position, and even in the future, it will have all the resources to further develop many decisive sectors of heavy industry. In the vast region between the Volga and the Urals, rich oil deposits have been discovered and are being mined on a large scale. In recent years, the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic have significantly increased their oil production. Now, the oil production of these two republics is more than twice that of the entire tsarist Russia. The construction of giant hydroelectric power stations on the Volga has established a powerful power base for the further development of the national economy.

The discovery of the rich iron ore deposits in the Kursk magnetic anomaly region has opened up broad prospects for the development of the industrial sectors in the central region of our country, which possesses a variety of industries. This largest iron ore region in the Soviet Union can provide high-quality iron ore for its powerful metallurgical industry for several hundred years; undoubtedly, it will play an important role in further strengthening the industrial power of the Soviet Union.

In the development of our national economy, the Ukrainian Republic, which plays a significant role, possesses a powerful coal industry, metallurgical industry, chemical industry, machine-building industry, and a rapidly developing power base. It has abundant natural resources needed for further economic development. In the southern regions of Ukraine, which are at the forefront in terms of known reserves and production of iron ore and manganese ore, mining areas have greatly expanded, and new deposits of various precious metals have been discovered. New coal fields—Dnieper and Lviv-Volyn—have been explored and discovered. These coal fields, along with the Donbas, will increase coal production year by year. In the next few years, the gas industry will develop extensively based on large-scale natural gas fields.

The further development of industry in Kazakhstan and Central Asia has a bright future. During the years of Soviet power, under the leadership of the Communist Party, which implemented Lenin's national policy, the face of these regions has changed. Here, new branches of modern industry have been established, and the level of agricultural production has greatly improved. In Kazakhstan, large deposits of iron ore, coal, chromite, high-grade bauxite, various non-ferrous and rare metals, and many other types of minerals have been discovered. Currently, Kazakhstan's copper, lead, zinc, and tungsten account for about half of the total known reserves in the Soviet Union, and molybdenum, which has a great future, accounts for more than one-fifth. Kazakhstan has rich and diverse natural resources, which allow us to develop a powerful industry in multiple sectors. Central Asia is rich in coal, oil, copper, lead, antimony, mercury, tungsten, and other minerals.

The industrial development of the Byelorussian, Moldavian, Caucasian, and Baltic republics, based on existing and new industrial centers established over several five-year plans, will proceed more smoothly in the future. In the development of industry, not only various local resources will be utilized, but extensive production cooperation will also be established with other economic regions of the country.

Even a brief overview can show that the Soviet state possesses all the necessary conditions to further comprehensively develop various industrial sectors, to further greatly develop the economy of the entire country, regions, and autonomous republics. The recent reorganization of industrial and construction management, the expansion of the powers of the autonomous republics and local authorities, the proximity of leadership and production, allow us to more fully and rationally utilize our resources, making these resources serve the people.

The 20th Congress of the CPSU pointed out that it is necessary to develop a long-term plan for the development of our economy and culture, including several five-year plans. The preliminary figures for several key sectors developed by our planning departments indicate how far our country can advance in the development of the national economy.

Now let's compare the figures that indicate the production level of several key products in the Soviet Union in 1957 with the figures that indicate the production level of these products in the most powerful capitalist country, the United States.

In 1957, the Soviet Union's iron ore production was approximately 84 million tons, coal was 462 million tons (converted to hard coal, 395 million tons), oil was 98 million tons, pig iron was over 37 million tons, steel was 51 million tons, electricity was 210 billion kilowatt-hours, cement was approximately 29 million tons, sugar exceeded 4.5 million tons, woolen fabrics exceeded 280 million meters, and shoes were approximately 315 million pairs.

In 1956, the United States produced 98 million tons of iron ore, 479 million tons of coal, 354 million tons of oil, 69 million tons of pig iron, 104.5 million tons of steel, 684 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 54 million tons of cement, 2.1 million tons of sugar, 299 million meters of woolen fabrics, and 586 million pairs of shoes.

From the above figures, it can be seen that the Soviet Union still lags significantly behind the United States in the production levels of some of the most important products. However, it should be said that the production level of the United States is no longer as unattainable to us as some people imagined 25 or 30 years ago. Currently, in terms of certain products, such as wheat, timber harvesting, and sugar production, the Soviet Union has already surpassed the production level of the United States. In terms of iron ore and coal, pig iron and steel, certain machines and instruments, cotton textiles and woolen fabrics, the gap between the two countries has greatly narrowed. The Soviet people have set a completely achievable task—to catch up with the United States in the production of meat, milk, and fats per capita in the next few years.

According to the preliminary draft that needs to be clearly defined, in about 15 years, the annual production of industrial products in the Soviet Union can reach the following levels: iron ore—250 to 300 million tons, pig iron—75 to 85 million tons, steel—100 to 120 million tons, coal—650 to 750 million tons, oil—135 to 400 million tons, gas production and extraction—2,700 to 3,200 billion cubic meters, electricity—8,000 to 9,000 billion kilowatt-hours, cement—90 to 110 million tons, sugar—9 to 10 million tons, woolen fabrics—550 to 650 million meters, shoes—6 to 7 billion pairs.

This is a preliminary estimate, and in actual life, it may be adjusted. The most likely scenario is that the deadline for implementing the draft plan may be shortened. Even if we have rich experience in planned economy, it is very difficult to absolutely accurately determine the development of production in various sectors, especially considering the rapid development of modern science and technology and the continuous increase of our cadres, which will provide additional sources for accelerating the development of social production.

When we talk about significantly increasing metal production, we are primarily referring to the large-scale development of the raw material base for the black metallurgical industry by mining recently discovered iron ore deposits. While significantly expanding mining work in the Krivoy Rog Basin, it is also planned to expand work in the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly, Kazakh, and Siberian mining areas. The Soviet Union's iron ore production can take the lead in the world in the next few years.

Special attention must be paid to the more extensive use of coal gas and oil to replace coal in the national economy. In this regard, we are significantly behind. It is sufficient to point out the following situation: in the total extraction of various basic fuels in the Soviet Union, natural gas accounts for only about 4% despite the extremely rich reserves of natural gas in our country.

Better utilization of oil and gas has great advantages. The extraction of natural gas and oil is more economical. The labor consumption for extracting one ton of natural gas (converted to standard fuel) is only about one-twentieth of the labor consumption for extracting one ton of coal, while the labor consumption for extracting oil is about one-sixth of that for coal. The cost of extracting natural gas is about one-twelfth of the cost of extracting coal, and the cost of extracting oil is about two-sevenths of the cost of extracting coal.

Given the great advantages of gas, we plan to increase the extraction and production of gas in our country by approximately 13 to 15 times in the next 10 to 15 years. Such a significant increase in gas production will not only allow gas to be used as fuel but also to produce nitrogen fertilizers and many other chemical products.

The associated gas extracted during oil production is the best raw material for the chemical industry.

In addition, the development of the gas industry will allow for the more extensive development of gas facilities in cities and workers' districts. This will enable millions of workers to save non-productive time and labor in their daily lives. In addition to the large-scale housing construction in the country, the extensive use of gas in daily life will be an important factor in improving the material life of the people. This will also eliminate the pollution of the air in cities and workers' districts by coal dust and coal smoke, greatly improving the sanitary conditions of the residents.

In the urgent task of further developing industrial production, it is also necessary to address the development of the chemical industry. We need to significantly expand the production of mineral fertilizers in the next few years, establish a powerful plastics, synthetic fibers, and other synthetic materials industry, so that we can widely use substitutes for non-ferrous metals, plant materials, and animal materials. This will not only solve many new technical problems in industry and construction but also greatly increase the production of high-quality consumer goods and significantly reduce the production costs of consumer goods. We can quickly develop the production of plastics, using this material as a substitute for metals in the machinery and construction industries, which will promote the further development of heavy industry. We can quickly expand the production of synthetic fibers, high-quality leather substitutes, and fur substitutes, so that in addition to the increasing natural agricultural raw materials, we can also obtain a large amount of new raw materials.

Now, the development of our heavy industry, machinery, and science and technology has reached such a level that we can develop light industry at a much faster pace without affecting the strengthening of our national defense forces and the further development of heavy industry and machinery, especially to produce more shoes and textiles for the residents, so that in the next 5 to 7 years, we can fully meet the residents' demand for these goods.

Currently, our country is solving the extremely important task set by the 20th Congress of the CPSU—to technically re-equip the railway transportation industry on a large scale. The Party and the government will spare no effort to implement a broad plan to electrify the railways and replace old and uneconomical steam locomotives with electric and diesel locomotives. In this way, we can improve the entire transportation work and bring it to a higher level.

Our country has quite favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of multi-sector socialist agriculture.

The reclamation of virgin and fallow land has made a great contribution to increasing grain and livestock production. Agricultural workers in many regions of the Russian Federation, especially in Siberia and the Urals, have launched the work of further reclaiming virgin and fallow land. The main way to complete this work is to better utilize the existing technology of machine-tractor stations and state farms.

Based on the achievements of socialist agriculture and considering its great potential, in the next few years, we should strive to significantly increase the production of grain and livestock products. To implement the decision of the 20th Congress of the CPSU to increase the annual grain production to 110 billion poods, we still have a lot of work to do. As for the prospects for the development of animal husbandry, our task is to catch up with the United States in the production of meat, milk, and fats per capita in the next few years. This means that, given the current population, we need to increase the production of meat to 20 to 21 million tons and the production of milk to 70 million tons.

In the future, we need to produce grain and livestock products on a larger scale to fully meet the growing needs of the country and foreign trade. Collective farms and state farms should increase the production of cotton, sugar beets, and other technical crops, as well as fruits, grapes, citrus, and tea in the next few years. Our main attention should be focused on improving cultivation techniques and increasing the yield per unit area in Ukraine, North Caucasus, the Central Black Earth Region, and other regions of our country.

Regarding the prospects for agricultural development, we should pay attention to how to utilize the vast resources of the Far East. Currently, when we are already able to equip agriculture with high technology, the development of the rich resources of the Far East has become a realistic task. If we can solve this task (and undoubtedly we can), then the Far East will be able to produce a large amount of commercial agricultural products.

Now, the socialist sector has become the basic supplier of all products in the country, and our people are solving the historical task of transitioning to communism, so the issue of increasing labor productivity has been raised to a primary position in both industry and agriculture. Reducing the labor consumption per unit of production is of paramount importance in the current stage of communist construction. Everyone knows that the Party is implementing a grand program to improve the material well-being of the people. In the future, this work will largely depend on reducing the cost of agricultural products, which will make it possible to continuously reduce prices. Therefore, now we not only evaluate the work of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms based on production but also based on production costs. Lenin put it this way, demanding a thorough study of the socialist economy, precise accounting, and the maximum utilization of all possible means.

Comrades, the calculations of our planning personnel show that the Soviet state can not only catch up with but also surpass the current United States in the production of various key products in the next 15 years. Naturally, the economy of the United States may also develop during this period. However, considering that the development speed of our industry is much faster than that of the United States, it can be confidently said that the task of catching up with the United States in the peaceful competition in a very short historical period is completely realistic and achievable.

It can be believed that the Soviet people will spare no effort to achieve victory in the peaceful competition.

Our plans for the further development of socialist industry and agriculture in the near future reflect the concern of the Communist Party and the Soviet government for the well-being and happiness of the Soviet people. In the next 15 years, the decisive industrial sectors will expand by approximately one to two times, and agriculture will develop rapidly, which will make it possible to significantly improve the living standards of the people and more fully meet the growing material and cultural needs of the Soviet people.

The Soviet people have achieved great successes in the development of the national economy, correctly assessing the significance of these achievements, and also fully understanding that we still have unresolved issues, still have shortcomings, and will encounter serious difficulties that need to be overcome.

We know that our housing is extremely scarce, and the reasons for the lack of housing are understandable. First, the Soviet government inherited an extremely scarce housing situation from the old system. Second, during the years of Soviet power, the population of cities and workers' towns has increased by more than three and a half times. Third, in the pre-war years, we had to simplify everything, including housing construction, and use every kopeck to build heavy industry. Fourth, the war caused enormous losses to the total housing stock of the Soviet Union, leaving 25 million people homeless.

Even so, the total housing stock in our cities has increased to 3.7 times that of 1913. During the years of Soviet power, a total of more than 500 million square meters of housing has been newly built and repaired (excluding the houses built by peasants and rural intellectuals). However, we do not want to be satisfied with the comparison with the past, with the "prosperity" of capitalist countries that have hundreds of millions of people without shelter and thousands of people living in slums.

In the concern of the Communist Party and the Soviet government for improving the material well-being of the people, the concern for expanding housing construction now occupies an extremely important position.

The program for the development of housing construction in the Soviet Union, which has been approved by the entire people, proposes the task of significantly increasing the housing area to eliminate the housing shortage in the country in the next 10 to 12 years. There is no doubt that the housing problem in our country will be successfully solved in the next few years.

We also know that the production of a series of consumer goods, both in quantity and especially in quality, is still lagging behind, and the cost and price of many of these goods are still high.

Efforts must be made to further improve production, to make production specialized, fully mechanized and automated, and to improve labor skills, so that labor productivity can be greatly increased and, on this basis, ensure the continuous increase of the wages of laborers. In the recent period, a series of measures must be implemented to adjust the wage system, eliminate existing shortcomings in the distribution of labor remuneration in certain industries, and establish a more reasonable comparison of wage grades and rates. More attention should be paid to improving urban and rural trade, improving public catering, and improving the living welfare, medical care, and cultural services for the residents. Caring for the daily needs of laborers is the primary responsibility of Party organizations, Soviet organs, economic organizations, cooperatives, and trade unions.

At this stage of our country's development, when the selfless labor of the Soviet people has brought the development of the national economy to a high level, the conditions have been created to raise the well-being of laborers at a faster pace. We believe that this task will also be successfully accomplished, just like all the tasks proposed by the Party and the Soviet state in the past.

The higher the level of development of science and technology, the closer the connection between science and technology and life, and the construction of communism, the faster our progress will be.

Even our enemies now admit that in the development of science and technology, in the level of technical equipment of various sectors of the national economy, and in the highly skilled cadres, the Soviet Union is at the forefront of the world. Now, Soviet science and technology, Soviet industry have reached such a level that we have no production and technical problems that we cannot solve with our own strength. The Soviet state has reached such a high level of science, technology, and production that it can increasingly utilize its resources to develop productive forces at a speed that was previously unimaginable.

In fact, could anyone have imagined 20 years ago that in such a short period, we could build such large-scale hydroelectric power stations like the ones we are building on the Volga, Angara, and Yenisei rivers? Could it be possible to solve such a huge task as the reclamation of 36 million hectares of virgin land in just two or three years? Ten or fifteen years ago, problems like the peaceful use of atomic energy, the manufacture of fast jet aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and artificial Earth satellites were considered to be in the distant future. Now, these complex problems of the contemporary world are being actually solved, and Soviet scientists and our industry are making their due contributions. Now, we have every reason to say that in the development of science, the Soviet Union occupies its rightful place in the world.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government will continue to make every effort to fully develop our science and technology, to flourish the multi-ethnic socialist culture, and to quickly apply the achievements of science and technology to production, to reduce the labor of Soviet people, and to increase their labor productivity.

Comrades! The role of the Communist Party and the Soviet government in solving the tasks of communist construction facing our country at the present stage is enormous.

Leading the economy and culture, consistently improving the well-being of the people, organizing, uniting, and mobilizing all laborers to achieve the transition to communism, educating the masses to have communist consciousness, these are the main directions of the activities of the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

Everyone knows that the establishment of the socialist society in the Soviet Union has led to profound political changes in the life of the state, the elimination of the exploiting classes, the formation of political and spiritual unity among the people, and the change and development of the functions of the Soviet state. Earlier, before the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the suppression of the activities of the remnants of the exploiting classes and their domestic enemies, the suppression of the efforts of the overthrown ruling classes to restore capitalist order, was one of the most important functions of the Soviet state, and after the elimination of the exploiting classes within the country and the consolidation of socialist production relations, this function gradually disappeared.

As the Soviet society continues to advance along the path to communism, the functions of the socialist state of the Soviet Union will continue to improve and change in appearance.

Socialism is not something fixed and unchanging. Socialism is a vibrant, continuously developing and perfecting society that constantly strives to fully meet the growing material and cultural needs of all members of society. Similarly, the socialist state cannot remain in a fixed and unchanging form. No, it also develops and changes in appearance as it advances towards communism.

Socialist democracy, true democracy of the laboring people, has been increasingly developed and fully implemented within the country. In recent years, measures have been taken to further expand the powers of the autonomous republics in economic and cultural construction, to enhance local initiative, to reorganize industrial management, and to shift the focus of leadership of enterprises and construction projects to the economic regions. These measures are major steps in the development of socialist democracy. These measures help to further unleash the initiative and enthusiasm of all Soviet people, to more widely attract them to participate in the management of the state, economy, and culture.

The main function of the socialist state of the laboring people now is to organize social production and lead the economy, various undertakings, and culture, to control the amount of labor and consumption for the benefit of the laboring people; to conduct comprehensive education of the laboring people, including the cultivation of new labor discipline and communist labor attitudes; in foreign policy, to consistently implement Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence and strengthening peace between countries with different socio-political systems; to strengthen the unbreakable friendship, brotherly cooperation, and mutual assistance of the countries of the world socialist system.

Lenin taught that for the state to completely disappear, it is necessary to fully implement communism, only at the highest stage of communism, when the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" is realized, when all products are extremely abundant on the basis of high labor productivity, when labor has become the main need of life, and people can voluntarily work to the best of their abilities, the state will disappear.

Of course, we must not forget an important function of the socialist state, that is, to defend its own country from foreign aggression, to defend the socialist system from the aggression of foreign imperialist forces and their agents who are trying to restore capitalism. The importance of this function of our state does not depend on us alone, or rather, it depends more on our enemies. The smaller the threat of foreign aggression, the less manpower and material resources we will spend on implementing this function of our state, and vice versa.

The Marxist-Leninist theory of the state, the theory of the gradual disappearance of the state as society advances towards complete communism, has great significance. From the internal development of the Soviet Union, it is completely possible and very appropriate to use the large amount of manpower and material resources spent on national defense, on preventing socialism from being attacked by enemies and their agents, to more rapidly develop the economy and improve the living standards of the people. However, unfortunately, the hostile policies and actions of the ruling classes of the imperialist countries do not allow us to do this.

The Soviet people, who are engaged in peaceful creative labor to solve the tasks of communist construction, have not forgotten that imperialist countries still exist, and their ruling classes have not abandoned the delusion of destroying socialism. Maintaining high political vigilance against the machinations of the enemies of socialism and their attempts to launch a new war, and strengthening our national defense and armed forces to be ready to repel the aggression of imperialist invaders at any time, this has always been a matter of special concern for the socialist state of the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Army and Navy, which are loved and respected by the entire people, are invincible because the Soviet military personnel have high moral qualities, deeply understand their patriotic duties, and are infinitely loyal to the socialist motherland. The main source of the strength and power of our Soviet Army and Navy, as emphasized in the resolution of the recent Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU, lies in the fact that the Communist Party is its organizer, leader, and educator. To defend our motherland, we must fight tenaciously to implement the instructions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. These instructions are: to keep the national defense of the socialist state at the level of modern military technology and science, to unremittingly improve military skills, to improve party and political work in the army and navy, to vigilantly defend the peaceful labor and great achievements of the Soviet people.

The indestructible unity and solidarity of the peoples of our country, their friendly mutual assistance in the development of the economy and culture, the vibrant Soviet patriotism, the firm determination of the Soviet people to build communism, their selfless labor for the motherland, these are the guarantees that the historic task of building communism will be successfully accomplished.

The strength of the Soviet people, who have won the honor of creators and heroes of the world, lies in the fact that for more than half a century, they have been led by the great Communist Party established by Lenin, tempered in the struggle for socialism, and inspired by the invincible Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Now, it is leading the people to strive for the completion of the tasks of communist construction.

The Soviet state is solving these tasks in the new historical situation, in the situation where the great Chinese people and the laboring people of all socialist countries are advancing together with the Soviet people. The brotherly friendship and mutual assistance of the peoples of the socialist countries, the unity of their Marxist-Leninist parties, enable humanity to advance very rapidly along the path of socialism, progress, peace, and prosperity.

The Soviet socialist state, which was established under the leadership of Lenin and is faithful to its internationalist duties, will make every effort to expand and strengthen the unbreakable friendship with the peoples of all socialist countries in the struggle to build socialism and communism, and to develop fruitful cooperation.

The October Revolution and the International Significance of the Growth of World Socialist Forces

Comrades!

In the past forty years, many events of great historical significance have occurred, and many countries have undergone fundamental changes in their socio-economic conditions. Such a forty-year period has never been seen in world history. The hallmark of these forty years is the triumphant march of democratic and socialist forces, the liberation of many countries and peoples from the shackles of colonialism and imperialism. The victory of the October Revolution unleashed a powerful wave of revolutionary liberation that swept across the world.

The international reactionaries once extinguished the revolutionary flames in some Western countries and temporarily delayed the collapse of the colonial system. However, the reactionaries were unable to extinguish the seeds of the Soviet revolution, and now nothing can stop the triumph of the great ideas of the October Revolution.

The past forty years have been a period of both broad and deep flourishing of the world communist movement and the workers' movement. In the revolutionary struggle, powerful Marxist-Leninist parties have emerged, grown, and been tempered. Currently, they have a total of more than 33 million members.

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin emphasized the international significance of the experience of the October Revolution, saying: "This experience has already been recorded in history as a result of socialism, and the future international revolution will build its socialist edifice based on this experience." ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Volume 27, page 377) The process of historical development has fully confirmed Lenin's prophecy.

During the Second World War and shortly after its end, people's democratic revolutions occurred in some countries of Europe and Asia, and several socialist countries emerged, which are now developing victoriously. The victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China is the most significant historical event since the great October Revolution. Now, the peoples of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia are advancing along the path of building socialism. These countries' laboring people have built and are building the edifice of socialism based on the experience of the October Revolution.

The emergence of the world socialist system is the greatest achievement of the international communist movement and the workers' movement, and the victory of Marxism-Leninism. This great victory is the result of the heroic struggle of the working class and laboring peasants, and the result of the revolutionary struggle of the communist and workers' parties of various countries, creatively applying the Marxist-Leninist doctrine in combination with the specific conditions of their own countries.

The world socialist camp is now a great and thriving force. In the world economy, the share of coal mining by the socialist camp accounts for more than 37% of the total, the production of pig iron and steel accounts for approximately one-quarter, and the production of cotton accounts for approximately one-third. The industrial production of socialist countries accounts for approximately one-third of the world's total industrial production.

Now there are two world systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system. Each system has its own unique laws of development.

Lenin taught that economic and political development imbalance is an inevitable law of capitalism. In capitalist society, economic development cannot be balanced, and the inevitable companions of production anarchy, crises, and fierce competition between monopolistic organizations and capitalist countries are inevitable. Under the capitalist system, the principle of strength prevails. From this, the tendency to solve contradictions through threats, coercion, launching wars, plundering other countries' territories, raw material sources, and markets arises. If individual capitalist countries can take the lead, it is because they have plundered millions of laborers through a small number of capitalist monopolistic organizations and ruthlessly exploited colonial and semi-colonial countries. The countries at the forefront of imperialism are the United States, and now West Germany is pushing Britain, France, and other capitalist countries to the forefront. Might makes right, money is everything, these are the laws of capitalism.

The relations between the countries of the world socialist system are completely different. Here, the laws of planned economic development are at work. The characteristic of the economic development of a socialist society, which aims to maximize the satisfaction of the growing needs of the people, is the rapid improvement of productivity and the continuous increase of national wealth. All socialist countries, regardless of size, whether they have walked far along the path of socialism or have just started, are completely equal. There is no country among them that seeks some kind of superiority and some kind of privilege. The experience of one socialist country can become the wealth of another country, and the achievements of each country not only strengthen that country but also strengthen the entire socialist camp.

The Soviet Union was the first to build socialism. The Soviet Union has accumulated rich experience and introduced it to all brother countries, helping them build new lives. Other socialist countries also have rich and valuable experience in economic and cultural construction, and they are also willing to introduce their experience to the Soviet Union and help the Soviet Union.

The victory of the people's regime, brotherly mutual assistance, and the implementation of the socialist industrialization policy have enabled the peoples of many countries to break free from the economic backwardness left by capitalism. The great achievements of the socialist countries have made the Soviet people and all friends of socialism rejoice. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, industrial production has increased nearly sixfold. The day when the people of China will build a powerful modern industry and become an industrial power is not far off. Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Albania have also made great achievements in the development of industry.

The achievements of the socialist countries in transforming agriculture based on socialist principles are remarkable. The Soviet Union, following the path indicated by Lenin, has transformed its agriculture based on socialist principles. Now, the People's Republic of China is also successfully solving this task, having completed the collectivization of agriculture. In Bulgaria, the socialist component in agriculture accounts for 87% of the cultivated land, in Czechoslovakia it accounts for 60% of the land area, and in Romania it accounts for more than 42% of all agricultural land. Other people's democratic countries are also implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The rapid development of the economy is a characteristic of socialist countries. The industrial production of socialist countries in 1956, compared to their own production levels in 1937, increased more than fourfold. Currently, the world socialist system has a highly developed industrial base, so socialist countries can more rapidly develop their economies and continuously improve the living standards of the laboring people.

What is the basis of the unity of the great socialist family?

The commonality of the principles of state and social systems, the unity of Marxist-Leninist thought, proletarian internationalism, the unity of the great goals of socialist construction, equality and mutual assistance, the defense of the national independence and revolutionary achievements of each country and the entire world socialist system, the defense of peace and the security of all peoples—that is the basis for the development of this brotherly family.

The Marxist-Leninist communist and workers' parties of each socialist country are the leading forces of these countries. Currently, the entire process of development has placed the task of strengthening unity and cooperation on the basis of Marxism-Leninism in front of the revolutionary parties of the working class. The communist and workers' parties, which are faithful to the principles of socialist internationalism, are fighting to strengthen their ranks, to fight against revisionist tendencies, and to fight against harmful prejudices such as nationalism and nationalism.

Imperialists use their old trick of "divide and rule," using various forms of nationalist prejudices to oppose the socialist camp, and under the guise of "national communism," they engage in ideological sabotage. The imperialist ideologues and their agents attempt to sow the seeds of chauvinism and bourgeois nationalism, inciting socialist countries to oppose each other.

Some people who claim to be communists have fallen for this propaganda, supporting socialism but not proletarian dictatorship, not the leadership of the working class and its vanguard—the Communist Party—in social life, and not the implementation of the principles of proletarian internationalism. Our enemies call this policy "liberal communism," revealing their hidden desire to turn communists into ordinary bourgeois liberals. The destination of modern revisionism can be seen from the examples of Djilas and Nagy Imre, who directly betrayed the socialist cause and sold out the fundamental national interests of their own countries. The defeat of the political and ideological positions of these enemies of socialism will help strengthen the socialist cause of these countries and the entire socialist system.

In the arsenal of modern revisionists, there is also the praise of bourgeois democracy. This is an old trick borrowed from the opportunists of the Second International. At that time, the traitors Kautsky, Mensheviks, and Socialist-Revolutionaries conducted a ruthless struggle against Lenin and the young Soviet Republic from this position. The "wise men" of the right-wing socialist leaders and the modern revisionists who collude with them probably argue like this: if the communists, in the countries where they are in power, allow opposition political activities against the socialist system, then we would acknowledge that there is freedom there, and we would praise them.

But we cannot allow the revisionists to praise the communists for such a thing! We stand on the Leninist position of strengthening and developing the socialist states, promoting socialist democracy rather than bourgeois democracy, and we will not deviate from the Leninist position!

The international experience of socialist construction in the transitional period, especially the lessons of the struggle of Hungary against the counter-revolutionary rebellion, show that the working class must be able to protect its power from the attacks of internal and external enemies, and the state of the laboring people must lead the construction of socialism, promote and strengthen socialist democracy.

Under the current conditions, there are various forms of socialism in the world. However, it should be emphasized that without a Marxist-Leninist party, a socialist state cannot exist, the working class cannot be organized into the leading force of society, the unbreakable alliance between the working class and the peasants cannot be guaranteed, and the task of building a socialist society cannot be successfully completed.

V. I. Lenin pointed out that all nations and countries will go to socialism, but the methods will not be the same, and there will be differences in the forms of democracy, the forms of proletarian dictatorship, and the speed of socialist transformation in various aspects of social life. The 20th Congress of the CPSU emphasized that the historical experience of the development of all countries advancing along the path of socialism fully confirms this principle of Lenin.

Some people try to seize Lenin's principle of the possibility of multiple forms and methods of transition to socialism and the relevant resolutions of the 20th Party Congress. They interpret these principles from their own point of view, saying that since Lenin pointed out and the 20th Party Congress confirmed and further developed Lenin's principle of multiple forms and methods of building socialism, therefore, the socialist countries do not need to be consistent. People who hold this view say that each country seems to be able to go to socialism through its own unique, completely unrelated to other socialist countries, path. The scientific theory of socialism considers and cannot but consider the historical characteristics of each country, which to some extent determine the forms and methods of socialist construction. This is self-evident. Any true revolutionary standing on the revolutionary position will not think that in the construction of socialism, it is possible to ignore the socio-economic and historical characteristics of the development of each country. If one stands on the position of Marxism-Leninism, then what should be placed first is not the characteristics that each country possesses, but the main and common points that form the basis of the struggle for socialism.

The differences in socialist construction practice can be reflected in the creation of this or that form of production management, this or that method of agricultural collectivization, but the elimination of private ownership of the means of production, the collectivization of peasants, is common. Without this, the socialist system cannot develop smoothly. Everyone knows that in the People's Republic of China, the problem of industrial management is solved in a way that adapts to the specific conditions of the country, different from the Soviet Union and, for example, Czechoslovakia. Although the specific forms of management are diverse, the main point of adhering to the Marxist-Leninist principles of socialist construction is unshakable.

The prestige of socialism has greatly increased among the laboring people, and socialist ideas have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people, to the extent that even the most far-sighted enemies of socialism and advocates of capitalism now have to tolerate the word "socialism," although they add a small supplement, saying that it is something like "national socialism" or "national communism."

Our class enemies feel that it is difficult to compete with the united and solid line of socialist states. Therefore, they try to defeat the socialist countries one by one to weaken the entire world socialist system.

The enemies of socialism hope that the communists will go to find some "new," artificial paths to socialism for each country. They suggest going to socialism separately, that is, dispersed, each doing its own thing, through different paths. If this view is accepted, there may be a lot of "paths," making people like getting lost in a forest, not knowing how to reach their great goal. However, this hope is doomed to fail. The communist and workers' parties have seen through the tricks of the enemies of socialism and given them a resolute rebuff. They firmly stand on the position of Marxism-Leninism and will not deviate from the correct path.

Internally destroying the socialist movement, dividing the socialist countries and parties, making them conflict with each other, is one of the most cunning forms of the struggle of imperialism and its agents against the world socialist system. This is one of the main dangers, and we must fight it resolutely.

The broad path to socialism has been paved, and the basic forms and methods of socialist construction have been tested by actual life and the experience of many socialist countries. These forms and methods should be further perfected, the rich experience accumulated should be mastered and summarized, the experience created by the masses should be enriched, and it should be continuously developed in combination with the conditions of each country and each nation, strengthening rather than shaking the socialist camp. In this way, socialist society will break through all obstacles and difficulties and continue to develop and grow.

The imperialist bloc and its agents, when attacking the socialist countries and their unity, direct their main attacks at the Soviet Union. Why? Because the Soviet Union is the strongest socialist country. Its example has a great influence on the international communist movement and the workers' movement, and on the peoples of the colonies fighting for national liberation and social liberation. Imperialists fear the strength of the Soviet state, fear the ideas of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, they try every means to slander the experience of the Soviet Union, and thus slander the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism.

Therefore, revolutionary parties and all revolutionaries who adhere to the class position of Marxism-Leninism consider it their sacred duty to strengthen internationalist ties, fully support the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries, strengthen the unity of all socialist countries, and strengthen the unity of all revolutionary forces.

Comrades! Now, socialism is having a great and increasingly powerful impact on the historical process of the whole world, changing the face of the world. Actual life has confirmed a great truth of Marxism, that socialism creates the possibility for the rapid development of society. What can modern capitalism compete with socialism? The production of the socialist countries from 1937 to 1956 increased more than fourfold, while the capitalist world, despite using all kinds of artificial "stimuli," including unlimited arms races, only increased its production by twofold. But the problem is not just here.

The general crisis of capitalism is continuing to deepen, and the antagonistic contradictions that divide the capitalist world are intensifying. The struggle between labor and capital within capitalist countries and between capitalist countries is developing in new forms. The general crisis of capitalism is also manifested in the phenomena of chronic unemployment and underutilization of enterprises, in the phenomena of overproduction and crises that occur from time to time in many capitalist countries. In the era of the general crisis of capitalism, militarism—the cancer of modern capitalist society—is an inseparable characteristic of aggressive imperialist politics and economics.

The capitalist system, which is doomed to historical condemnation, can no longer propose any goals that can inspire and attract millions of people. Capitalists, in order to prolong their existence, resort to extremely cunning disguises and deception, seeking refuge in the deceptive phrases of "people's capitalism," "democratic capital," "universal happiness" of the bourgeois state, etc. However, whether it is the cheap propaganda traps of the defenders of capitalism or even the imperialists trying to stop the development of socialism by force, they cannot stop the process of historical development.

Reformists praise modern capitalism, extolling the social legislation that has appeared in some capitalist countries over the past forty years. However, they cover up the main fact: if the capitalists have made some concessions, then these concessions are won by the working class through unyielding struggle. The achievements of the socialist countries inspire the laboring people of the capitalist countries to struggle against the exploiters, forcing the bourgeoisie, who are still trying to maintain their rule, to make some concessions of a social and economic nature. In this regard, one cannot help but recall the words of the outstanding American writer Theodore Dreiser, who said about the appearance of social legislation in the United States in the 1930s: "All this I owe to Marx and Red Russia."

In the imperialist countries, exploitation is intensifying, the living standards and democratic rights of the laboring people are under attack, and the dangers of fascism and war are deepening. However, in these countries, there is the working class, there are other strata of the laboring people and progressive intellectuals, that is, there are people's forces that, in general, stand on the side of socialism and democracy and fight for peace. Undoubtedly, the future belongs to these forces.

The deepening of the general crisis of capitalism is particularly evident in the collapse of the colonial system. The trend is that this shameful system will be completely eliminated. India, Indonesia, Burma, Egypt, Syria, and many other countries have gained independence. The countries of the East, which have freed themselves from colonial oppression, are seeking rapid revival of their economies and cultures. In all colonies and semi-colonies, the movement for national independence and freedom is growing stronger.

Not long ago, countries that were once colonies or semi-colonies are not only seeking political liberation but also striving to break free from the economic shackles that make these countries subordinate to capitalist countries. The American and British imperialist blocs are engaged in a fierce struggle for influence in the colonies and semi-colonies. The colonizers have been forced to withdraw from some countries, but they have installed agents from the bourgeoisie and feudal forces in those countries. These agents of the colonizers, seemingly standing on the position of defending their national interests, actually implement the policies of imperialist invaders.

Now, a new form of colonial policy has emerged, which is mainly promoted by the United States. After the military adventure of England, France, and Israel to invade Egypt failed, the American imperialists proposed the "Dulles-Eisenhower doctrine," claiming that the Middle East has supposedly formed a "vacuum," and their mission is to fill this vacuum.

However, everyone knows that there is no "vacuum" in the Middle East. The land suitable for living is inhabited by a large number of residents, the hardworking Arab peoples—culturally rich peoples—live and work there, enjoying the blessings of nature. The colonizers' theory of "vacuum" is actually an imperialist contempt for the Arab peoples, a refusal to recognize the independence of the Arab countries, and a belief that these countries should be subject to the rule of British and French colonizers or colonizers from the United States. The Arab peoples of the East are fighting against both British and French imperialism and American imperialism, understanding that all imperialists are a deadly danger to them. Now, American imperialists are conducting a series of conspiracies against Syria. They are using Israel to play this despicable trick, inciting Turkey to take risks and provoke.

Imperialists try to maintain their rule in Asian and African countries by various means. Of course, the colonizers still have considerable strength, and the danger threatening the peoples of these countries cannot be underestimated. However, the irrefutable historical fact shows that the end of imperialist rule in the East has arrived.

The great attraction of the example of the Soviet Union (its prosperous Soviet republics in Central Asia have become a socialist beacon in the East), the example of the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries inspire the peoples of the East to struggle for freedom and independence. The Soviet Union and all socialist countries, which have consistently implemented a just policy that serves the interests of all peace-loving peoples, are selfless friends of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

From the beginning of its establishment, our country has resolutely rejected all practices based on plunder, violence, and aggression in international relations, firmly declaring the principles of good-neighborliness and equal economic relations with all countries.

On November 8, 1917, at the Second Congress of Soviets, Lenin argued the provisions of the peace decree, saying: "We reject all clauses about plunder and violence, but we are willing to accept all clauses about friendly conditions and economic agreements, and we cannot reject such clauses." ("Lenin Collected Works," Volume 26, page 223)

From the moment the Soviet state was born, it has taken the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems as the basis of its foreign policy. In 1918, Lenin mocked the harmful idea that the interests of the world revolution did not allow a truce with the imperialists. At that time, he wrote: "According to this view, the socialist republic cannot conclude any economic treaty with the imperialist powers, and if it does not fly to the moon, it simply cannot exist." ("Lenin Selected Works," Chinese edition, Volume 2, page 332) Socialism and capitalism coexist on the same planet, so their coexistence is a historical necessity.

We advocate a policy of peaceful coexistence with capitalist countries, advocating the conclusion of bilateral friendly agreements and the conclusion of collective security agreements in Europe and Asia to strengthen peace.

The famous five principles—mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs for economic, political, and ideological reasons, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence—are the basis for relations between countries with different systems. It is necessary to acknowledge the fact that there are currently socialist countries and capitalist countries, and they are walking their own paths. The existing systems within these countries are the internal affairs of the peoples of these countries. Disputes between countries should be resolved through negotiations, not through war. No war, living in peaceful competition, this is the basis for peaceful coexistence.

The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of peace, seeking to reach agreements on various issues related to disarmament that are acceptable to both sides with Western countries. The Soviet Union is ready to significantly reduce armed forces and armaments, ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, immediately stop testing these weapons, and establish international supervision, as long as Western countries also take similar measures. Currently, the problem is not on our side.

All countries, especially the Soviet Union and the United States, which possess the most powerful economic and military forces, if they can seek solutions to important international issues (including the issue of disarmament) in a realistic and cooperative spirit of mutual understanding, then the possibility of preventing a new war and establishing lasting and solid peace between countries and peoples will greatly increase. The Soviet Union will continue to adhere to the policy of easing international tensions and improving relations with all countries, including the United States, because mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States will have a decisive impact on improving the overall international situation. In this regard, we hope to improve our relations with the United States without harming the interests of other countries and without worsening the relations between the United States and Britain, France, and other countries. Moreover, our country also hopes to maintain good relations with all countries that oppose war and advocate peaceful coexistence, and we are making every effort to establish such relations. To achieve this, the correct path is to abandon the "policy of strength," because the highest stage of this policy is war.

Even such an event as the launch of the Soviet artificial Earth satellite by the imperialists is used for their own purposes. They shout and ring the alarm bells, saying that the launch of the satellite by the Soviet Union is a threat to peace and is threatening the capitalist countries with new weapons.

We solemnly declare that our people have never thought of, nor will they in the future, use any destructive weapons, as long as our country is not attacked by imperialist countries. We know that since the Soviet Union can create an Earth satellite through the efforts of scientists, engineers, and workers, other countries, especially a highly developed country like the United States, can also create the same thing. Of course, the achievements we have made are of great significance because we have gained time in the competition with capitalist countries. However, the country that first achieves this achievement should not incite the heated atmosphere of the "cold war" and create conditions for the expansion of armaments. Everyone knows that the "policy of strength" and the arms race will lead to war, and under modern conditions, war will bring incalculable sacrifices and the destruction of a large amount of material wealth.

The heads of the governments of the United States and Britain recently held a private meeting, not to find ways to ease tensions, but to find ways to intensify tensions and continue to expand armaments. We hope that capitalist and socialist countries will hold high-level talks to announce, on the basis of considering real situations and mutual understanding, that war will not be used as a means to solve international problems, to stop the cold war and arms race, to establish relations between countries on the basis of coexistence, not through war, but through peaceful negotiations, through peaceful competition in the development of the economy, culture, and better satisfaction of the spiritual and material needs of the people.

All brotherly communist and workers' parties and social parties that adhere to the views of Marxism-Leninism take such a position. Some bourgeois parties also advocate peaceful coexistence.

Now, the peace-loving peoples of various countries are rightly anxious, because the current "competition" is heading in another direction. The recent meeting between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Britain shows that the ruling cliques of the two major capitalist countries still insist on pursuing the "policy of strength." From the communiqué issued after this meeting, it can be clearly seen that the ruling cliques of Britain and the United States, under the pretext of the alleged strengthening of the Soviet threat, have jointly decided to continue to incite the "cold war," increase military spending for the production of weapons of mass destruction, and prepare for war.

In December, the heads of governments of the countries participating in the North Atlantic invasion bloc will hold a meeting, which is not a good omen for the cause of peace. It is noteworthy that the governments of some of these countries were or are led by the leaders of the Socialist Party. These parties claim to be socialist parties, but in fact, they implement the policies of the imperialist bloc. They mislead the working class, trying to make it seem that the Soviet Union is unwilling to reach an agreement on disarmament and easing international tensions, so they have to continue the arms race. However, this is a deception of the working people. Imperialists cunningly use the policies of some leaders of the Socialist Party.

The heads of the governments of the United States and Britain, Mr. Eisenhower and Mr. Macmillan, recently invited the current Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the famous figure of the Belgian Socialist Party, Mr. Spaak, to hold a meeting, which is not accidental. The fact shows that the imperialists are intensifying the involvement of right-wing socialists in anti-people preparations for war.

No matter what tricks the imperialists use, their conspiracies are doomed to fail. The people do not want war, they are vigilant in defending peace, and they always oppose the aggressive conspiracies of the international reactionaries.

The Soviet Union has always advocated world peace in the past and present, and it will make every effort to prevent the threat of a new war. We will continue to strive for disarmament, the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, the creation of an atmosphere of mutual trust among peoples, and the transformation of the United Nations into a true tool for peace.

The most aggressive imperialist bloc tries to create conflicts in places where conflicts can be manufactured, intensifying military threats, thus preventing a considerable part of the manpower and material resources of the socialist countries from being used for constructive labor. The strategy of the aggressor bloc is to build their own military bases around the socialist countries and to form and expand military blocs.

The policy of maintaining and intensifying international tensions is the line of the imperialist reactionaries. Imperialists pursue a policy of cold war, seeking to maintain the arms race. This is most concretely reflected in Dulles' advocacy of keeping the world perpetually on the "brink of war." Imperialists want to use this method to maintain the economic prosperity of the monopolistic groups in the United States that make money from the arms race and to increase the tax burden on laborers. Disarmament and easing of tensions are not in their interest. Without an arms race, they will be forced to reorganize production, shifting from military production to civilian production. Such a reorganization of production is beneficial to the people, but the monopolists fear reorganization because it will greatly reduce the profits from military orders. They fear economic deterioration and increasing difficulties in selling civilian goods. Monopolist capitalists also fear that easing tensions and abandoning the arms race will make it impossible for them to threaten the laboring people and use the "danger of communism" to terrorize the people and persecute the progressive forces that fight for peace under this pretext. Imperialists, in order to consolidate the dictatorship of monopolistic capital, adopt the policies of cold war, arms race, and intensifying international tensions. Imperialists try to make workers believe that military prosperity can guarantee full employment for the people and is supposedly beneficial to workers. However, advanced workers know that military prosperity will not last long, and they know that the arms race will not bring them any benefits.

Another prospect is the development of the civilian production sector. There are great possibilities for mutually beneficial trade between countries. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have repeatedly expressed their willingness to develop trade relations as broadly as possible. Undoubtedly, this will lay a solid foundation for the development of trade and economic relations between countries. This is in line with the line we are implementing that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully.

The policy of peace, aimed at easing international tensions and strengthening friendship between countries, is the banner of all socialist countries. This policy is in line with the fundamental interests of the laboring people, the interests of developing and strengthening the new socio-economic structure, and the interests of consolidating world peace.

Actual life shows that the only correct path to the development of international relations is the policy of peaceful coexistence, the policy of consolidating peace and friendship between peoples.

Of course, we advocate the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, but this does not mean that we recognize that there are no contradictions between socialism and capitalism, and that they can establish full "harmony," and that the communist ideological system and the capitalist ideological system can be reconciled. Whoever takes this view deviates from Marxism-Leninism. Ideological differences are irreconcilable, and they will continue to exist, but this does not exclude peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between socialist and capitalist countries.

Under the current conditions of military technology development, if the imperialists launch a world war, they will inevitably cause unimaginable great destruction and losses. The use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and ballistic missiles will inevitably bring great disasters to all mankind. If the capitalist system causes such a disaster, it will inevitably perish. The peoples of all countries will no longer tolerate a system that brings pain to mankind and unleashes bloody wars of aggression.

Although we are convinced that if the imperialist bloc launches a new war, the result will inevitably be the destruction of the system that produces the war, that is, the capitalist system, and the victory of the socialist system, we communists have never, and will never, intend to use such a terrible means to achieve our goals, because it is immoral and contrary to our communist worldview. We believe that the victory of socialism does not require war.

The world socialist system possesses powerful economic, political, and military forces. No matter how crazy the imperialists are, they cannot destroy the increasingly powerful forces of the world socialist system and cannot stop the advance of society towards communism.

Comrades! We have witnessed and promoted the ideological and political upsurge of the international communist movement and the workers' movement. Our Party's 20th Congress, especially the conclusions of this Congress on the extremely important issues of the peaceful coexistence of the two systems, the possibility of transition to socialism in different forms, the possibility of preventing war in the modern world, and the development of the world socialist system, to a great extent, promoted the arrival of this upsurge. The ideas of the 20th Congress of the CPSU have received extensive support from the brotherly communist and workers' parties. The congresses of the communist parties of China, France, Italy, and many other countries have shown the unity of the communist parties, their loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and their firm determination and indomitable will in the struggle for great goals.

The international communist movement and the workers' movement are developing under the banner of proletarian internationalism, under the glorious battle cry of "Workers of the world, unite!" When we review the path that the world workers' movement has traveled, we proudly point out: the glorious Chartists, the proletarian heroes who fought in the barricades in France, Germany, and Hungary in 1848, the warriors of the First International, the immortal heroes of the Paris Commune, and the workers of the United States (on their initiative, the laboring people of all countries began to celebrate May 1st— the day of international proletarian unity), are our predecessors.

In 1881, Marx and Engels wrote about the mass meeting in Petersburg to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Paris Commune: "When the Paris Commune, due to the brutal massacre by the defenders of 'order,' met its defeat, the victors never imagined that in a distant city, an event would occur that would make the 'Russian Commune' inevitable, although this would require a long and brutal struggle." ("Selected Correspondence of Marx and Engels," 1953 edition, page 348) The struggle was indeed long and brutal. The prophecy of the two great teachers of Marxism was finally realized thirty-five years later. After another forty years of arduous struggle, today, under the glorious banner of Marxism-Leninism, under the leadership of the communist and workers' parties tempered by long battles, millions of people are advancing towards communism with confidence. We are proud that the working class of the Soviet Union was the first to complete the socialist revolution. Today, on the path to communism, our country, the great Soviet people led by the glorious Leninist Communist Party, is at the forefront.

Comrades! The summary of the forty years of the great October Revolution shows that the working class has achieved many victories of world historical significance in the struggle to build socialism. Now, the 950 million people of the socialist countries are building new lives under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, striving to build socialism and hasten the arrival of the victory of communism. Socialism has long since become a practical issue, becoming the vibrant creative endeavor of the peoples of many countries.

Today, tens of millions of people are advancing under the banner of Marxism-Leninism. Tomorrow, tens of millions and hundreds of millions of laboring people will stand under this victorious banner!

When the Soviet people celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, they show the world their achievements under the leadership of the Communist Party. No one can deny that the Soviet Union is now a powerful socialist country, a country with a high level of culture, science, and technology. The most outstanding achievements of the socialist revolution are the unprecedented improvement of the cultural level of the people and the cultivation of a new type of person—the active builders of communism. The spiritual world of the people of the socialist society is rich, their ideals and creations are great and bold!

If in the past people said that the red star on the spire of the Kremlin in Moscow shone brightly, now the creative labor of the Soviets has built and launched new stars into the universe— the first man-made satellites in the world. These two man-made satellites are symbols of the progress of Soviet science and technology, symbols of the victory of Soviet science and technology. They are justly called peaceful satellites. When the Soviet man-made satellites orbit the Earth, it means that the science and technology and the entire economy of the Soviet state have reached a high level of development, and that the people of this country are building a new life under the banner of Marxism-Leninism.

The Soviet state is entering its fifth decade. Our future is bright and great.

We solemnly remember the words of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, who instructed us: The best way to commemorate the anniversary of the October Revolution is to concentrate our efforts on solving the tasks that have not yet been solved. The Communist Party and the Soviet people look to the future, facing the great tasks of communist construction. The Party and the people are solving these tasks with firm confidence, believing in their creative power, believing that communism will inevitably be victorious.

Long live the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution!

Long live the builders of communism—the great Soviet people!

Long live the friendship of the Soviet people with the peoples of the socialist countries and all peace-loving peoples of the world! Long live world peace!

Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the inspirer and organizer of all victories in the struggle to build socialism and communism in our country!

Long live our great, invincible banner—Marxism-Leninism!

    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十年
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在1957年11月6日苏联最高苏维埃庆祝会上的报告最高苏维埃代表同志们！苏联工人、集体农庄庄员和知识分子同志们！从世界各个角落来到苏联的我们亲爱的外国贵宾们！
    我受苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联政府、苏联共产党中央委员会的委托，代表它们向你们热烈祝贺欢乐的大节日——伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年！
    今天我们同苏联公众的代表和外国的贵宾团聚在苏联首都，参加最高苏维埃的庆祝会来共同纪念我们的伟大节日。十月革命的四十周年是苏联社会主义胜利的节日，是全世界劳动人民的国际节日。
    十月社会主义革命在人类历史上有最伟大的意义。当俄国无产阶级和最贫苦的农民一起，在以伟大的列宁为首的布尔什维克党领导下夺得政权并宣布新的社会制度和国家制度诞生时，整个世界都受到了彻底的震动。世界上第一个工农国家高举了被光荣的斗争和胜利所照耀的社会主义的革命红旗、伟大的马克思列宁主义旗帜。
    在十月革命四十周年的日子里，苏联各族人民向全人类显示了社会主义的历史性胜利。我国的工人阶级一向把自己看作国际工人运动中的一支队伍，它把自己的成就看作是各国劳动人民的胜利，看作是自己对人类摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义锁链的伟大事业的贡献，对建设社会主义新社会的事业的贡献。
    我们的党、苏联全国人民、全体进步人类，在回顾有历史意义的十月革命的日子，回顾社会主义祖国走过的光荣道路的时候，都怀着深深爱戴的心情提到一个人的光辉的名字，这就是弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁。他的不朽的天才、坚忍不拔的革命战士的意志鼓舞了、并且还在鼓舞着千百万劳动者为共产主义的胜利而斗争。
    在庆祝十月革命四周年的时候，弗拉基米尔·伊里奇曾经鼓舞人心地写道：
    “我们有权自豪，而且我们正在自豪：我们居然这样幸运，开始来建设苏维埃国家，因之开始了全世界历史的新时代，也就是开始了新阶级统治的时代，这个阶级在一切资本主义国家中都是被压迫的，而现今到处都在向着新生活，向着战胜资产阶级，向着无产阶级专政，向着把人类从资本桎梏，从帝国主义战争中永远解脱出来的目标迈进。”（列宁全集第三十三卷第三十二——三十三页）
    四十年前，备遭帝国主义战争摧残的我们的祖国经历了极严重的经济破坏，站在了崩溃的边缘。资产阶级和地主的政策曾经使俄国注定要遭受帝国主义列强的瓜分，注定要变成西方资本主义大国的殖民地。孟什维克党和社会革命党帮助了资产阶级和地主实行这一卖国政策。只有一个党是作为真正爱国革命力量而行动的。它反映了工人阶级和劳动农民的根本利益、全体人民的希望抱负。这就是光荣的、列宁的布尔什维克党——我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心。
    我国人民紧紧地团结在共产党周围，满怀信心地跟着党前进，为人类开辟通往幸福光明的未来——通往社会主义的道路。这是历史上未曾有过的新道路。第一次成为自己命运的主人的我国工人阶级、劳动人民，在保卫社会主义成果中表现了前所未见的坚强精神、英雄主义和英勇气概，在克服艰难困苦中表现了对革命事业的无限忠诚和忠实以及自我牺牲精神，在建设没有资产阶级和反对资产阶级的社会主义新社会中表现了不可动摇的顽强精神和真正的人民智慧。
    帝国主义者不甘心于俄国无产阶级革命的胜利。他们不甘心于这个胜利，不仅仅是因为他们对我们国家进行经济奴役的计划破产了，而且首先是因为十月革命是鼓舞所有资本主义国家无产阶级和殖民地人民的范例，是对世界帝国主义体系的一个毁灭性打击。
    帝国主义者企图把历史的进程向后拖，他们强使我们打起了国内战争，他们发动了武装干涉，打算用武力把社会主义革命扼杀在摇篮中。
    我国各族人民在严峻的斗争中捍卫住了十月的成果。由当时住在苏俄的、具有革命情绪的中国、匈牙利、波兰、南斯拉夫、芬兰、罗马尼亚、德国、捷克斯洛伐克等国的同志以及其他国家的劳动者组成的国际部队，同苏俄的劳动人民一道向革命的敌人作了战。在同白卫分子和干涉者进行的斗争中，各国工人阶级和劳动人民给了年青的苏维埃共和国以巨大的支持。生活表明，捍卫自己的政权和自己的成果的工人和农民一旦很好地组织起来和被社会主义思想所鼓舞，就是不可战胜的。帝国主义者的干涉遭到失败后，他们又想用经济封锁来扼杀年青的苏维埃共和国。但是，苏联人民在各国工人阶级和劳动人民的支持下，也粉碎了世界反动派的这一阴险的计划。
    在资本主义包围条件下，在同国际帝国主义阴谋进行不断的斗争中，苏联劳动人民在共产党的领导下，摧毁了阶级敌人的疯狂反抗，在短短的历史时期内建成了社会主义。他们向全世界显示出摆脱了资本主义桎梏的人民的伟大创造力量、在伟大的创造性劳动中所发挥的力量。
    各国劳动人民、全体进步人类以毫不放松的注意力和热烈的同情注视着苏联人在头几个五年计划的年代中所取得的史无先例的劳动功绩，为苏维埃国家的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。
    而与此同时，世界帝国主义的头目策划了消灭苏联的血腥计划。在1941年，帝国主义者把他们最凶恶的打击力量——希特勒法西斯主义——投向我们祖国。由于法西斯侵略者的背信弃义的进攻而强加给我们的战争，是对苏维埃制度的巩固性及社会主义国家的力量和生命力的严重考验。
    苏联人民及其英勇的武装力量承担了第二次世界大战的主要重担。他们不仅保卫了自己祖国的自由和独立，而且对拯救人类免遭法西斯奴役威胁的事业作出了决定性的贡献。有人想抹煞或是贬低这一胜利的意义。但是，谁也没有能够从人民的记忆中、从历史上抹煞掉苏联人民这一伟大的功勋！不仅我们同时代的人、而且我们的后代都将永远神圣地怀念着在殊死的战斗中击溃法西斯匪徒的英勇的战士们，怀念着拯救人类光明未来的那些人。
    波兰、南斯拉夫、捷克斯洛伐克和阿尔巴尼亚等国人民以及随后的罗马尼亚、保加利亚和其他欧洲国家的武装部队，同苏联人民及其勇敢的武装部队肩并肩地进行了反对德国法西斯主义的英勇斗争。英雄的中国人民及其光荣的人民解放军在击溃日本帝国主义的事业中作出了重大的贡献。美国、英国、法国和其他反希特勒同盟国的人民在爱好和平的各国人民反对希特勒德国和日本军国主义的共同斗争中起了重大的作用。
    由于在第二次世界大战中对希特勒法西斯主义和日本帝国主义的伟大胜利，欧洲和亚洲一系列国家的人民摆脱了资本主义和殖民主义压迫的枷锁，掌握了自己的命运，走上了社会主义建设的道路。
    苏联人民一向感受到国际无产阶级、全世界千百万劳动人民的友好的、兄弟般的支持。我国最先于1917年突破了帝国主义阵线，建成了社会主义，粉碎了希特勒的战争机器，这样就光荣地履行了自己对各国劳动人民、对国际共产主义和工人运动、对世界一切进步力量的国际主义职责。
    社会主义起先在苏联一个国家取得了胜利，而目前已经成为一个强大的世界体系。我们感到幸运和高兴的是，同苏联人民携手并进的有光荣的共产党所领导的六亿中国人民，有在各自的共产党和工人党领导下建设社会主义的各国劳动人民。
    今天庆祝伟大十月革命四十周年的时候，全体苏联人民都怀着深切的感激心情想起那些以英勇的斗争、忘我的劳动争取到社会主义革命胜利的人们，那些为建立和巩固苏维埃政权、为加强社会主义祖国的威力和为它的繁荣而斗争的人们。苏联各族人民将永远崇敬地怀念着为革命事业、为保卫革命的果实、为争取社会主义在我国胜利而牺牲的同志们。
    在这个意义重大的日子里，苏联人民向一贯给予我国工人阶级和劳动人民在争取社会主义、争取和平的斗争中以兄弟般的支持的各国工人阶级和劳动人民表示衷心的感谢和敬意。
    参加我们今天庆祝大会的有社会主义各国党和政府代表团，有来自六十一个国家的兄弟共产党和工人党的代表。参加会议的还有世界许多国家的代表。
    我受苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议、苏联共产党中央委员会的委托，代表全体苏联人民向我们的全体贵宾表示热烈欢迎。

    一切革命的主要的、根本的问题，是政权问题。在人类历史中曾经有过不少次革命，但是，在过去，没有一次革命的结果是劳动人民战胜了统治阶级，没有一次革命巩固了劳动人民的政权。只有十月社会主义革命在历史上第一次使这个问题得到有利于劳动人民、有利于人民的彻底解决，由此就开辟了一个新纪元，社会主义和共产主义胜利的纪元。
    法国资产阶级革命提出自由、平等、博爱的口号以来，已经差不多有一百七十年了。但是，资产阶级在自己争取政权的斗争时期提出这个口号以后，实际上从来就没有想过如何把它付诸实现。恰恰是在法国，工人阶级和劳动群众屡次奋起斗争，反对资产阶级统治，并且在1871年建立了光荣的巴黎公社，这是工人阶级和劳动人民第一次尝试建立自己的政权和确立无产阶级专政。资产阶级反动势力把巴黎公社淹没在工人的血泊中。在这种残酷的镇压中，资产阶级表现了对工人阶级的兽性的仇恨。当法国资产阶级统治遭到威胁的时候，法国资产阶级由于害怕起义的人民，就忘掉了自己内部的纠纷，忘掉了它同普鲁士军国主义者的世仇，而同德国反动势力联合起来，于是德国军队就被派来镇压巴黎公社。这个历史事实生动地表明，工人阶级一旦企图建立政权，各国资产阶级就把力量联合起来，对革命的无产阶级进行斗争。但是，任何血腥镇压都没有能摧毁劳动群众要求摆脱资本主义枷锁的不屈不挠的意志。在各国工人阶级和劳动人民的这个斗争中，巴黎公社成了鼓舞人心的革命英雄主义的榜样。
    俄国工人阶级为争取自己解放而展开斗争时，参考了自己国内以及其他国家的革命运动的经验和教训。按照弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的生动的说法，俄国经过半世纪闻所未闻的苦难与牺牲、见所未见的革命英雄主义、难以置信的毅力以及忘我的探求、学习、实践的考验、失望、检查和对欧洲经验的比较，才真正体验到马克思主义是唯一正确的革命理论。
    团结了一切最先进、最革命人士的共产党在工人阶级的革命斗争中诞生和巩固，并且得到了锻炼。俄国劳动人民在这个政党的领导下经过了1905年以及1917年2月的革命风暴，完成了永远结束我国社会压迫和民族压迫的十月社会主义革命。十月革命确立了苏维埃政权，解放了我国各族人民，打下了劳动人民真正平等和各民族兄弟友爱的基础。
    马克思列宁主义教导我们，当世界上还存在着剥削阶级和被剥削阶级的时候，真正的平等是没有、也不会有的。十月革命的伟大意义在于它导向了社会主义的胜利，建成了消灭剥削阶级、消灭人剥削人现象的社会。
    有人攻击我们站在阶级斗争立场的马克思主义者，说我们残酷，例如他们硬说，似乎十月革命牺牲了很多人。事实上，1917年10月推翻资产阶级政权虽然是通过工人和士兵的武装起义来实现的，但是并没有流很多的鲜血。从历史文件中可以看出，在攻打冬宫的战役中，双方的阵亡人数是微不足道的。大家也很清楚，工人阶级在革命胜利后表现了非常宽宏大量和人道，甚至某些参加过反革命暴乱的将领们，例如像克拉斯诺夫之流，在1917年也获得了假释。资本主义的代表们大概把这种宽大看作是无产阶级革命软弱的表现。被推翻了的阶级纠集了武装力量向苏维埃政权进军，在苏联策动了内战。德、英、法、美、日和其他国家的帝国主义者武装精良的军队支持了我国国内的反革命叛乱。俄国的工人阶级记得巴黎公社的经验教训、1905年革命和1917年2月革命的经验教训，不得不拿起武器来奋起捍卫自己的革命果实。
    因此，在国内战争和外国干涉的年代中造成连年不断和激烈非凡的战争的罪魁，不是布尔什维克，也不是工人阶级和劳动人民，而是为革命所推翻了的剥削阶级与世界资本主义反动势力。十月革命是最人道的革命，因为它使千百万劳动人民摆脱了剥削者的桎梏，把俄国各族人民从民族压迫的枷锁下解放了出来，动员了最广大的人民群众进行自觉的创造，并且建立了最高级形式的民主——社会主义民主、劳动人民的民主、全体人民的民主。
    当十月革命剥夺了剥削者手里的生产资料，把它们转变为全民所有的时候，资产阶级大放厥词，说劳动人民没有能力管理国家，没有能力发展社会生产。这种无耻的谰言有如肥皂泡般地破灭了！
    苏联四十年社会主义建设的经验令人信服地证明了自由劳动对强迫劳动、为自己劳动对为剥削者劳动的无比优越性，经济的计划发展对生产的无政府状态和追求最大利润的意向的无比优越性。社会主义建设使千百万劳动群众的积极性空前高涨。这在全民的社会主义竞赛中特别明显地表现了出来。
    在无比困难和复杂的社会主义建设工作中，共产党和苏维埃政府以列宁的英明的社会主义建设计划为指南，坚持不渝地执行了党的国家工业化、农业集体化和实行文化革命的总路线。
    这是唯一正确的道路。只是依靠了建立自己的强大的工业，我们这个处于资本主义包围中的国家才能够巩固无产阶级革命的胜利，才能够保障自己的独立，才能够在对国民经济实行技术改造的基础上圆满地解决发展国民经济的任务。只是依靠了实行小农经济的合作化和建立大规模的社会主义农业，才能够使构成我国人口绝大多数的农民摆脱世世代代的贫困，吸引他们积极参加新生活的建设。只是由于实现了文化革命，才能够消除文盲和愚昧这种沙皇俄国的严重遗毒，使一切科学文化成就服务于人民，培养真正人民的新知识分子，保证科学文化的强大发展。
    这是一条困难的道路。在争取达到伟大目标——建成社会主义的斗争中，需要有高度的组织性，铁的纪律，创造性主动精神和自我牺牲精神。在夺取政权的革命斗争中表现过惊人的英雄主义的工人阶级，在建设社会主义的创造性劳动中也表现了这一切崇高的品质，以自己的令人鼓舞的榜样吸引了千百万农民群众、全体苏联人民。我国劳动人民不怕困难和匮乏，在空前短暂的时期内建立了以现代技术装备起来的强大的工业。
    社会主义建设任务之所以能够胜利实现，是由于共产党和苏维埃政权在其全部活动中都是依靠工人阶级和农民的牢不可破的联盟，这个联盟，按照列宁的论断，是世界上最惊人的力量。
    在苏联由于贯彻了列宁主义的民族政策，各民族的友谊巩固了，历史上第一次解决了消灭各民族经济上和文化上不平等的任务。在各加盟共和国建立了强大的现代工业，工人阶级和知识分子的民族干部成长起来了，民族形式、社会主义内容的文化获得了全面的发展。
    在头几个五年计划期间，我国从一个经济落后的国家转变成为一个强大的工业——集体农业国家——社会主义的牢不可破的堡垒。至于苏联在那段时期中已经有多么强盛，苏联人民在伟大卫国战争中的胜利作了明显的说明！在那次战火中，苏维埃制度经受住了严酷的考验，变得更加巩固，锻炼得更加坚强了。
    苏联生活战后时期的特点是，在发展经济和文化、提高人民福利方面有了新的成就。我国治好了战争带来的创伤后，以更快的速度向前迈进。
    我国在苏维埃政权年代中在经济方面获得的成就，可以用下列的材料来作简略的说明：
    钢产量从1913年的四百二十万吨增加到1957年的五千一百万吨。1913年我国生产的生铁比英国少五分之三，比法国也少，而现在，我们出产的生铁比英国、法国和比利时生铁产量的总和还要多得多。
    目前，苏联煤的开采量占欧洲第一位，占世界第二位，石油的开采量占世界第三位。同1913年相比，煤的开采量从两千九百一十万吨增加到1957年的四亿六千二百万吨，石油的开采量从九百二十万吨增加到九千八百万吨。仅去年一年的石油开采的增加量就差不多等于革命前俄国的全年石油开采量的一倍半。
    电力生产从1913年的十九亿度增加到1957年的两千一百亿度。单是在十月革命四十周年前夕提前全部投入生产的古比雪夫水电站，每年生产的电力就将为1913年俄国所有的电力站生产的电力的五倍。工业工人得到的电力装备的份额在苏维埃政权年代增加到二十倍。所有的城市、差不多所有的工人镇以及三分之一以上的集体农庄都已经电气化了。
    至于说到作为国民经济一切部门技术进步的基础的机器制造业，那么只要提一提苏联的机器制造业和金属加工业的产量增加为1913年的二百倍以上就够了。
    1957年苏联整个工业的总产量增加为1913年的三十三倍，其中生产资料的生产量增加到七十四倍。在研究苏联经济发展的这些材料时，应该注意到，苏维埃国家存在的四十年中，差不多有二十年是被强加在我们头上的战争，以及随之而来的国民经济的恢复工作占去。因此，苏联工业达到如此强大的高涨实际上并没有用四十年，而只用了二十年到二十二年。
    说到帝国主义者对苏联的军事冒险究竟给苏联的经济发展和人民物质福利的提高造成了何等严重的困难，只消谈一谈下列材料。希特勒德国背信弃义的进攻给苏联国民经济造成的损失（包括军事开支和被占领地区工农业收益方面的临时损失）达二五六九○亿卢布。如果把这笔巨额款项投入和平建设——建设各种工厂、铁路、发电站、住宅以及增加人民日用品的生产量，那么我们早就有了丰裕的物质资料。
    尽管如此，苏联的经济还是不断地顺利发展着。苏联在工业生产、特别是在作为整个经济的基石的重工业方面所取得的这种飞速的发展是历史上未曾有过的。为了把工业生产量增加到约三十倍，在美国、德国和英国曾经花了八十年到一百五十年的时间。
    就工业生产绝对产量而论，苏联早已把欧洲最大的资本主义国家英国、法国和西德远远地抛在后面了。现在，苏联正在顺利解决这样一个任务：在短短的历史时期内在按人口平均的产量上赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家，其中包括美国。
    列宁曾不止一次地强调指出，劳动生产率对新社会制度的胜利具有决定性的意义。革命前俄国的劳动生产率比美国低许多倍，同时也大大低于英国和法国。现在，在劳动生产率方面苏联已经超过了英国和法国，并且就要赶上美国。同1913年相比，苏联工业的年度劳动生产率约增长到九点五倍，而美国只增长到二点三倍。指出下列事实是重要的：我们的劳动生产率是在广泛地采用科学技术成就、机械化和改善劳动条件的基础上增长的。
    工业、首先是重工业的迅速发展是农业社会主义改造的关键。
    列宁的合作化计划指出了在取得政权后解决无产阶级革命这个最困难的任务的唯一正确道路。集体农庄制度的胜利把苏联变为世界上最大的农业生产国。全体苏联农民都参加了集体农庄，现在国内约有八万个集体农庄。有五千八百个国营农场——社会主义大企业建立了起来，它们拥有约五千五百万公顷的耕地，即拥有将近国内全部耕地的25％。社会主义农业拥有强大的物质技术基础。在集体农庄和国营农场田地上工作的有一百六十三万二千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）、四十二万台谷物收割联合机、将近六十六万辆载重汽车，数百万架其他复杂的农业机器。
    由于对农业进行了社会主义改造、用现代化的技术装备了农业的结果，农业生产的劳动生产率大大地提高了。从事农业的居民所占的比重约比革命前的时期减少了二分之一，而商品农产品产量却增加了数倍。与革命前收成最好的1913年比较，商品谷物的产量几乎增加到三倍、其中小麦为五倍，商品原棉、向日葵和蔬菜的产量增加到六倍，甜菜和马铃薯几乎增加到三倍。
    在1953年苏共中央九月全会以后，党和政府着手实现急剧提高农业生产的宏大纲领以来的这四年，是农业发展中的重要阶段。加强农业的物质技术基础、开垦荒地、加强集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导干部、提高农业工作人员在提高农业生产中的物质利益、规定新的农业计划办法等等措施，具有重大的意义。现在农业正在满怀信心地加快自己的发展速度。
    请允许我列举一些材料，说明近几年农业发展的情况。1957年，苏联全部播种面积是一亿九千三百二十万公顷，即比1913年多七千五百万公顷。这一成绩本身就是突出的，但是更加值得注意的是这样一个事实：在苏维埃政权整个时期播种面积的增长额中，约有半数（三千六百万公顷）是在最近四年增加的。
    由于扩大了播种面积和提高了单位面积产量，农产品的总收获量和采购量急剧增长了。下面就是一些指标。截至1957年11月1日为止，国家的谷物征购量和收购量为1953年同期的120％，其中小麦为143％，甜菜为175％，马铃薯为148％，蔬菜为179％。牲畜的征购量和收购量为148％，其中猪肉为304％，牛奶和奶制品为190％，羊毛为142％，蛋类为165％。在1957年的头十个月中，国家工业企业生产的动物油比1953年同期多二十三万四千吨，即多68％。
    诚然，由于国内有些地区、特别是伏尔加河流域、乌拉尔和哈萨克的某些州遭受了旱灾，国家今年的谷物收获量要比去年少些。虽然有旱灾，但是由于开垦了荒地，国家仍然拥有必要数量的谷物。至于开垦荒地在国家经济中起有多么巨大的作用，可用这样些事实来说明。截至1957年11月1日为止，在荒地开垦区采购的谷物（不包括代用品）达十亿零二千一百万普特，而1953年全年在这些地方只采购了六亿一千八百万普特；在西伯利亚地区这两年分别是六亿四千五百万普特和二亿四千七百万普特；其中阿尔泰边疆区就有约二亿八千万普特，而1953年全年是二千九百万普特。由此可以得出一个结论：党所提出的开垦荒地的任务是符合我们人民的根本利益，符合共产主义建设的利益的。
    畜牧业长时期以来是农业中最落后的部门之一。由于党采取了一些措施，现在情况有了变化。在1953年10月，牛的头数仅比革命前俄国的水平高出四百六十万头，而在随后的三年中增加了七百四十万头，在1956年10月，比革命前的水平高出一千二百万头。与头数增加的同时，牲畜的产品生产率也大大提高了。与1913年相比，商品肉类的产量增加为两倍，奶类增为三倍，羊毛为三倍，其中细毛和半细毛几乎增加为五倍。
    先进的集体农庄和国营农场周密地考虑了进一步发展畜牧业的可能性和远景以后，保证大大增加畜牧业的产品生产，并且号召农业劳动者展开斗争，争取在最近几年在按人口计算的肉类、奶类和油脂的生产方面赶上美国。得到党中央委员会支持的这一号召，引起了农业劳动者积极性的巨大高涨，这一号召得到全体苏联人民的一致赞同。
    在我国展开了争取实现这一任务的运动的时候，资产阶级报刊言论纷纷地说这一任务是不现实的，说我们似乎只是为了宣传等等。然而生活、集体农庄和国营农场的实践却在揭穿这些诽谤性的臆造。今年发展畜牧业的结果更加加强了这样一种信心：这一任务是可以完成的。请看，俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、摩尔达维亚和其他共和国和各州的先进集体农庄和区是多么热情高涨地在为发展畜牧业而斗争。例如，摩尔达维亚共和国恰迪尔—伦格区的集体农庄1956年全年平均每一百公顷土地生产了三十四公担肉，而在今年头十个月内，生产了六十六·六公担。摩尔达维亚集体农庄到1957年11月1日为止一共交售给国家的肉几乎为去年同时期的两倍半，而且还保证了牲畜头数的进一步增加。文尼萨州克雷饶波尔区的集体农庄去年全年平均每一百公顷农业用地生产了三十八公担肉，而在今年头十个月内，生产了一百○一公担，即为去年的两倍半。楚瓦什自治共和国伏尔纳区列宁集体农庄把每一百公顷土地上的肉的产量由去年的四十九公担增加到1957年头十个月内的一百一十公担。
    试看，只要合理地利用社会主义农业的潜力和优越性，在一年之中能获得多么大的成绩。像这样一类能够证明可以圆满实现在最近几年内急速增加畜牧业产品的任务的例子，可以举出许多许多。
    同志们，苏联的成就把我们的敌人散布的布尔什维克的革命只能破坏、甚至毁灭文明这种鬼话打得烟消云散了。我们国家四十年的经验令人信服地表明，取得了政权的人民是最勤勉的主人，是愈来愈多的物质财富和精神财富的不倦的创造者。这个经验表明，只有在社会主义制度下，在社会生活和个人生活的一切领域中才能出现迅速的、真正群众性的、有全体人民参加的前进运动，物质生产的发展才能不断推进，科学和文化才能空前繁荣。妇女的解放，吸引她们积极参加社会活动，是社会主义革命的卓越成果之一。苏联妇女在经济建设和文化建设各个领域中以自己的创造性劳动为争取共产主义胜利的全民斗争，为教育新生一代的事业做出巨大贡献。
  社会主义为生产力的发展开辟了无限广阔的余地，使人民的物质福利得到不断提高。国民收入的增长是这方面最概括性的证明。按人口平均计算，苏联的国民收入增加为1913年的十三倍。在这一时期，美国按人口计算的国民收入增加不到原来的两倍，英国和法国只为原来的一·六倍多一点。
   苏联社会主义的胜利永远消除了像失业这样的劳动人民的灾难。在我国国民经济中从业的职工人数从1913年的一千二百九十万人增加到1957年的五千二百六十万人，即为四倍多。社会主义革命不仅宣告了、而且也在事实上保证了我国全体公民的劳动权、教育权和休息权。全体人民对新生的一代和曾经为人民、为社会主义诚实地劳动过的老一代人的关怀，是社会主义社会这个最人道的社会的典型特征。
    为了实现第二十次党代表大会的决议，党实行了提高低工资职工的工资、缩短节日前和休息日前的工作日这样一些措施。党和政府关于向七小时工作日、而在采煤和采矿工业的地下工作中向六小时工作日过渡的决议正在实现中。在近几年住宅建筑的规模大大扩大了。
    苏维埃国家每年支付大量款项作为社会保险费用、津贴、优抚金和奖学金，作为免费教育、医疗事业的费用等等。仅在今年一年，用于这方面的拨款超过一千九百二十亿卢布，约占国家预算全部支出的三分之一。劳动人民十分欢迎新的国家优抚金法。
    苏联人民的物质福利的提高表现在人民消费的增长和苏联商业的发展上。我国劳动人民有可能购买越来越多的各种商品，他们的衣食住大大地改善了。
    1957年国营商业和合作社商业的销售量同1940年相比，肉类和肉制品增加到三·三倍，动物油、奶类和其他奶制品增加到三·五倍，糖增加到三·三倍，纺织品增加到二·八倍，其中毛织品的销售量几乎增加到四倍，丝织品增加到九倍。1956年人民购买了两千一百多万只钟表、三百多万辆自行车、四百二十万架无线电收音机和电视机，而今年这些商品的销售量还要多。
    近年来工业开始生产更多的缝纫机、冷藏器、洗衣机和吸尘器。
    苏联文化革命的实现是社会主义的伟大成果，由于文化革命，我国的科学技术发展在世界居于前列。早在第二次世界大战以前我国就基本上消灭了文盲。目前苏联受各种教育的人数超过五千万。仅在高等学校和中等技术学校中求学的人数目前就已经超过四百万人，而在1914年只有十八万二千人。目前在国民经济各部门工作的有受过高等和中等专门教育的六百多万专门人材，几乎等于革命前俄国的三十三倍。工程师和技术员、农学家和畜牧学家、教师、医生以及其他专门人材的大军正在积极地参加共产主义建设的伟大事业。在文学和艺术的发展方面取得了很大的成就。作家、艺术工作者是我国知识分子中积极地为争取伟大的共产主义理想的胜利、为教育新人——共产主义社会的建设者而奋斗的先进部队之一。
    在进行十月革命四十周年的总结时，我们应当特别感谢苏联科学家的有成效的劳动，他们以具有伟大世界意义的发明和发现增加了我们的祖国和全人类的财富。这里不可能一一列举苏联科学家的全部杰出成就。我只提一点，那就是我国在和平利用原子能的巨大力量方面占据着最先进的地位，不久前我们成功地进行了洲际弹道火箭的试验。
    制成并在1957年10月4日成功地发射世界上第一颗人造地球卫星这件事是科学技术成就的顶峰。过了不到一个月，第二颗苏联人造卫星又向宇宙发射了。它装备有更加完善的各种科学仪器，并且载有试验动物。现在我们的第一颗卫星在宇宙中遨游再也不会感到寂寞了。苏联的两个使者——两颗和平之星正在围绕着地球飞行。我们的科学家、设计师、工程师、技术员和工人们实现了人类的大胆理想，他们在十月革命四十周年的时候以真正伟大的礼物振奋了苏联人民。在科学技术的发展中标志着一个新时代的社会主义国家的这些成就，的确震惊了全世界。
    世界各地千千万万朋友对苏联科学技术人员、我国工业部门的工人们所建立的极其伟大的功勋，由衷地感到兴奋并且表示热烈的祝贺。在这同时，苏联的这个胜利却引起了社会主义敌人的恐惧和惊慌，他们确信，既然苏联能成功地解决这样复杂的科学技术问题，可见苏联已经把自己的科学技术和工业水平提到了何等的高度。
    过去美国曾经宣布说，他们准备发射一颗名叫“先锋”的人造地球卫星。不叫别的名字，恰恰叫“先锋”！我们也宣布过，我们打算发射人造地球卫星。现在大家都看到，苏联科学技术的创造努力获得了成功。在小小的“苏联月亮”出现之后，美国的某些国务活动家声明说，他们并没有想过要在制造人造卫星方面同苏联进行竞赛。现在，当我们的两颗卫星在围绕地球飞行的时候，他们就这样说了。显然，“先锋”这个名字反映出了美国人以为他们的卫星将是世界上第一颗卫星的信心。但是实际生活表明了，领先的、打先锋的是苏联的卫星。我们的卫星正在围绕地球运行，并且在等待着美国的和其他国家的卫星出现在它们身边，组成卫星的大家庭。这种大家庭、这种竞赛，比军备竞赛、比生产毁灭性武器的竞赛要好得多。
    把自己的天才和创造性劳动贡献于制造第一批人造地球卫星的苏联科学技术工作者和我们的工业工人博得了全国人民的尊敬和一切珍视科学的进步和繁荣的人的衷心感激。请允许我代表党和政府，从这个崇高的讲坛上热烈祝贺他们获得的出色胜利，并向他们表示深深的感谢！
    同志们！苏联建成社会主义是伟大的十月革命的主要成果。
    社会主义社会是人类历史上新型的、前所未有的社会。苏维埃社会没有相互敌对的阶级。这个社会由于利益的一致和目标的共同性而团结成一个整体，它紧密地团结在自己的先锋队——共产党的周围。我们党是在反对同马克思主义和无产阶级的阶级利益不相容的和敌对的那些东西的斗争中成长、壮大和发展起来的。党的全部历史表明，如果党对孟什维克分子、社会革命党人、无政府主义者、托洛茨基分子、右倾分子、资产阶级民族主义者和马克思列宁主义的其他敌人不进行无情的斗争，如果不在思想上和政治上粉碎这些敌人，党就不可能完成社会主义革命的领袖的作用，就不可能完成我国社会主义胜利建设的组织者和鼓舞者的作用。
    从十月革命胜利后最初的那些日子起，以党的创始人和领袖——伟大的列宁为首的共产党就引导苏联人民全力保卫十月的果实，实现社会主义建设计划，加强苏维埃国家的威力。在弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁逝世以后，党团结在以约·维·斯大林为首的党中央委员会周围，坚决一贯地实现列宁的规划，把我们的国家从一个胜利引向另一个胜利。在党的领导下苏联人民实现了国家的社会主义工业化和农业集体化，建成了社会主义社会，在伟大的卫国战争中取得了具有世界历史意义的胜利。由于这些胜利，我们祖国变成了强大的社会主义国家，更进一步地提高了自己的国际威信。
    苏共第二十次代表大会是苏维埃国家在走向共产主义的发展中，在党和苏联人民的生活中的重要历史阶段。我们全国和全体苏联人民都热烈欢迎第二十次代表大会的决议，热烈欢迎代表大会制定的共产主义建设计划，并且以更大的创造热潮为实现这些决议和计划而劳动。最近劳动人民代表苏维埃的活动显著地活跃了起来，它们在领导经济和文化建设中的作用提高了。苏联工会正在发挥群众的创造积极性，更广泛地吸引劳动人民管理生产。列宁共产主义青年团正在进行巨大的有成效的工作，它一贯热烈响应我们党的号召，在共产主义建设的各个部门中表现出主动精神和首创精神。代表大会以后这一时期的特征就是在我国的发展中取得了新的巨大的成就。
    第二十次党代表大会在分析我们走过的道路以及拟定未来的计划时，表现了高度的马克思列宁主义原则性以及对原有缺点和错误的不调和性，把布尔什维克的批评与自我批评提到了新的高度，树立了以创造性的态度解决共产主义建设现阶段所提出的任务的榜样。党代表大会对有关约·维·斯大林个人崇拜的错误给予了原则性的批评，同时提出了消除个人崇拜后果的办法。党代表大会对个人崇拜进行批评，是根据马克思列宁主义的基本原则，根据弗·伊·列宁关于约·维·斯大林的缺点和他性格中的一些不良特点的批评性意见（斯大林的这些缺点和不良特点在他的晚年时期特别厉害，给我们的共同事业造成了严重的损失）。这种批评以及党为消除个人崇拜的后果而做的大量工作使共产党的一切工作有了改进，使列宁关于集体领导的原则和党内生活的准则得到了彻底的实现，使革命法制得到严格遵守，使党内民主和苏维埃民主得到进一步发展，使思想工作得到提高，广大劳动群众的创造主动性和积极性也高涨了。
    我们党在二十次代表大会上自己主动地对斯大林的错误展开了批评。展开这种批评首先是为了纠正这些错误，其次是使这些错误永不重犯，第三是不允许用教条主义、书呆子的态度来对待马克思列宁主义，要保证以创造性的态度对待这个理论，同时，还要严格保持我们科学的社会主义的伟大理论的纯洁性。
    我们共产党员批评个人崇拜，认为这是同马克思列宁主义精神格格不入的，是共产党内和社会主义社会内一种不能容忍的现象。党这样做是为了巩固自己的阵地，加强社会主义制度，决不容许今后再发生这种现象。但是我们不能同意那些企图利用对个人崇拜的批评来攻击社会主义制度、攻击共产党的人。党一方面批评斯大林活动的不正确方面，另一方面在过去和将来都同所有这样的人作斗争，他们毁谤斯大林，在批评个人崇拜的幌子下不正确地描述和歪曲在斯大林领导中央委员会时我们党的活动的整个历史时期。作为忠心耿耿的马克思列宁主义者和坚强的革命家，斯大林在历史上将占有应有的地位，我们党和苏联人民将记得斯大林并且给予他应有的评价。
    某些“批评家”千方百计地企图诋毁我们党的斗争的这个时期，诋毁苏联在争取社会主义的斗争中所奠定的康庄大道。他们把过去和现在鞠躬尽瘁地为人民的利益、为社会主义事业而斗争的忠于列宁主义的活动家叫作斯大林主义者，并且使这个名词成为一个恶名。他们企图这样来贬低、毁损忠于马克思列宁主义事业、忠于无产阶级国际主义原则的共产党和工人党的活动家的声誉。这种“批评家”不是臭名昭著的毁谤家就是滚到修正主义泥潭中去的人，他们企图假借对“斯大林主义”的批评掩饰他们脱离马克思列宁主义原则的行径。帝国主义宣传机关用反对“斯大林主义”和“斯大林主义者”的挑衅口号作为武器，那不是偶然的。
    党曾经而且今后仍将坚决地同一切离开马克思列宁主义的做法、同任何想歪曲马克思列宁主义实质的企图、同一切想削弱我们在争取社会主义和共产主义的斗争中的意志、破坏我们的团结、搞垮我们的一致的人进行斗争。
    只有强大的、相信人民、同人民有不可分割的联系、取得人民无限信任和支持的马克思列宁主义政党，才能采取直接和公开地批评同个人崇拜有关的缺点和错误这样勇敢的步骤。有哪一个资本主义国家中的执政党能够像这样做呢？这样的政党是没有的！恰恰相反，它们全都力图向人民隐瞒和掩饰自己活动中的缺点和错误，粉饰资本主义的无可救药的缺陷和病毒，用在资产阶级社会中的“阶级和平”和“调和”等形形色色骗人的理论来欺骗劳动人民。
    工人阶级作为一个如旭日方升的革命的阶级，不需要掩饰和粉刷在新生活建设中的缺点和错误。弗·伊·列宁着重指出，
  “无产阶级不怕承认它在革命过程中哪些事情作得非常好，哪些事情没有作好。过去一切灭亡了的革命政党所以灭亡，就是因为它们骄傲自大，不善于看到自己力量的所在，怕说出自己的弱点。而我们是不会灭亡的，因为我们不怕说出自己的弱点，并且能够学会克服弱点。”（列宁全集第三十三卷第二百七十八页）
    我们的党一贯遵循列宁的党内生活准则，不断地改善形式和方法，改进工作作风，在从上到下的各个环节中一贯执行集体领导和党内民主的原则。
    马克思主义辩证法教导说，一切发展都是通过揭露矛盾和克服矛盾实现的。在资本主义制度条件下，敌对的阶级是相互矛盾的，这些矛盾具有不可调和的性质，只有通过阶级斗争才能得到解决。在建设社会主义的最初阶段，当剥削阶级的残余（资本家、地主和富农）还存在的时候，当他们在国内还有某种影响，并且受到外国反革命势力支持的时候，阶级斗争可能尖锐起来，矛盾就可能成为对抗性的。
    由崇高的精神上和政治上的一致而团结起来的社会主义社会，在它已经没有剥削阶级，剩下的是劳动人民——工人和农民这两个友好阶级，它所具有的矛盾就在原则上不同了。这里基本上是发展中的矛盾和困难，它们是由于社会主义经济迅速高涨，由于人民物质文化要求的提高而产生的，这是新旧之间的矛盾，先进和落后之间的矛盾。这是由于社会主义社会成员的需求日益增长而物质技术基础还不能满足他们的要求而产生的矛盾。苏维埃国家四十年的经验表明，社会主义社会本身在通过迅速和不断发展社会主义和共产主义的物质技术基础，通过提高劳动人民的社会主义觉悟而顺利地解决着这些矛盾。
    苏维埃社会正以蓬勃的速度在发展。在发展到一定阶段就有必要改进和改善社会主义建设的这一方面或那一方面的领导形式。我们党的全部活动表明，它是坚决同因循守旧和落后的现象作斗争的，它屡次放弃过时了的形式，而制定符合于向前发展的要求的新形式。
    党的全部实际活动是永远生气蓬勃的、一往直前的，是充满革命精神的马克思列宁主义的具体表现。党的第二十次代表大会的决议、近几年党所采取的关于急剧发展农业、改组对工业和建设的领导的各种措施就是这样对待事情的范例。
    共产党的政策得到了全体苏联人民的一致支持，这令人信服地表现在：苏共中央六月全会关于马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫和参加他们一伙的谢皮洛夫反党集团的决议受到了人民的一致热烈拥护，因为这个集团的人反对苏共第二十次代表大会制定的方针，企图破坏我们党的列宁主义的团结。党和人民清除了这个反党集团后，就更加紧密地团结了自己的队伍，坚定地、满怀信心地沿着唯一正确的列宁主义的道路走向伟大的目标——建成共产主义社会。
    苏维埃国家全部四十年的经验教导我们，如果没有一个统一的、坚如磐石的党，没有一个用社会发展规律的知识武装起来的党，没有一个忠于马克思列宁主义伟大原则的党，工人阶级、劳动农民以及我国全体人民就不可能取得政权，粉碎自己的敌人，建成社会主义社会和顺利地实现向共产主义的逐步过渡。我们今后仍将像保护眼珠一样保护我们光荣的党的列宁主义的团结，加强它同人民的联系，我们今后仍要高高举起伟大的、战无不胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜！
    苏联各民族紧密地团结在自己久经考验的先锋队——共产党的周围，党和人民在争取共产主义的斗争中密不可分的团结，是苏维埃国家今后取得成就的保证。
　　（二）苏联共产主义建设的前景和任务
    同志们！在总结苏维埃政权四十年来的发展的时候，我国人民满怀信心地瞻望着未来，清楚地看到共产主义建设的前景。共产党遵循着列宁的指示：在政治上应当永远向前看，而不是向后看。
    苏维埃国家现在处在自己历史发展的新阶段。我们这里已经为过渡到共产主义建设的更高阶段创造了有利的条件，一切物质前提和精神前提。苏联人民认为这些条件和前提是更加迅速地向前迈进和今后取得更大胜利的基地和基础。社会主义每取得一个成就，就是向共产主义社会最高阶段迈进一步。
    国际无产阶级天才的领袖和导师马克思和恩格斯在阐明未来的社会时说过，未来的社会在其发展过程中将有两个阶段，第一个阶段是社会主义，第二个阶段，即高级阶段是共产主义。如果说，社会主义作为从资本主义内部产生的社会的第一阶段，它不得不考虑它从过去的历史中所继承下来的那些条件，并且还带有“资本主义的胎记”，那么共产主义则是在社会主义胜利后所创造的自身基础上发展的。马克思教导我们说，只有“当劳动已经不单单是谋生的手段，而且本身已成为生活的第一要素时；当生产力已随着每个人在各方面的发展而提高，一切公共财富泉源都尽量涌现出来时”，社会才可能完成向共产主义高级阶段的过渡。（马克思恩格斯文选第二卷第十五页）
    列宁创造性地发展了马克思主义，把社会主义和共产主义的学说具体化了。他制订了我国的共产主义建设计划，在这个计划中特别强调说，社会主义经济基础的基础以及国家沿着共产主义道路发展的总路线应该是：建立强大的社会主义工业和全国电气化，农业合作化，在采用新技术和发展社会主义竞赛的基础上不断地提高社会劳动生产率，实现文化革命。
    还在国家遭受破坏和饥饿，在许多人都认为年轻的苏维埃共和国的局势差不多毫无指望的那些日子里，在这种极端困难的条件下，我们的党提出了大胆和宏伟的全俄电气化计划，这个计划揭开了国家在以后数十年中发展的鲜明前景。当时列宁曾说过，共产主义就是苏维埃政权加全国电气化。列宁的这个定义反映出了共产主义建设的马克思主义观点的实质；关于共产主义社会的物质生产基础问题和负有实现从资本主义过渡到共产主义的使命的国家政权的政治形式问题，是不可分割地统一在一起的。
    马克思列宁主义对共产主义的理解同人民群众在社会革命改造方面的活生生的实践活动有着不可分割的联系。真正的、科学的、生气勃勃的共产主义——不是书本上教条的共产主义——的公式同那些华丽的词句的区别在于：这些公式认为更完善的社会主义生产组织、工人和农民的劳动条件、提高人民福利所必需的产品产量的增加、人们在劳动过程和日常生活中的关系是具有决定性意义的。
    现在，当苏联经过四十年的发展在国民经济、科学、技术和文化的提高方面取得了卓越的成就并且已经建成了社会主义的时候，我们有一切根据宣布，共产主义已经不是遥远的未来的事情，共产主义的光辉宏伟的大厦正日益清晰地在各族人民的眼前显现出来，它在不断地增高，并且将随着我们多民族国家的工人、农民、知识分子在劳动中的每一成就而取得日臻完善的形式。
    党的第二十次代表大会拟定的经济和文化建设纲领，是在提高国民经济一切部门方面向前迈进的一大步。这一纲领正在成功地实现中。大家知道，共产党中央委员会和苏联政府不久前通过了制定1959—1965年苏联国民经济发展远景计划的决议。完成这一计划，毫无疑问将使我们更接近于解决基本经济任务——在最短的历史时期内在按人口计算的产品生产方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    苏联人根据什么可以深深地相信进一步大大发展我国国民经济的计划能够胜利完成呢？
    这种信心是有根据的：第一，苏维埃国家现在拥有技术上先进的强大的社会主义工业和正在蓬勃发展的大规模的机械化的农业。
      第二，我们现在拥有业务水平很高的干部，他们能够改进技术、不断提高社会劳动生产率，不断提高工业、建筑业、运输业和农业中的经济指标，来成功地解决发展国民经济的最复杂的任务。
    第三，由于苏联科学技术发展的卓越成就，由于这些成就在生产中得到了更广泛的运用，我们可以用最少的人力和资金来在发展生产力方面获得最大的成果。
    第四，我们国家拥有无穷无尽的天然资源，能够无限地发展经济。我们有一切必要的条件来迅速发展各种各样的国民经济部门，来更加充分地满足社会日益增长的需要。
    第五，世界社会主义体系的存在、各社会主义国家的亲密合作和互相帮助以及它们经济发展计划的配合，有利于社会主义阵营各国最迅速地向前发展。
    这些就是基本因素，这些基本因素使得有深厚的爱国主义热情因而无限热爱自己的社会主义祖国的苏联人确信，建设共产主义的宏伟计划，必将像共产党以前制定的所有计划一样顺利地完成。
    更有效地利用我国现有的资源是实际实现发展国民经济的远景计划的一个重要环节。
    在革命前的俄国，对矿藏几乎没有进行过研究，勘探出来的铁矿和煤矿蕴藏量总共只占世界蕴藏量的3％强。资本家和地主在治理国家方面搞得很糟，虽然本国有丰富的资源，却要从别国输入煤炭、磷肥、钾盐以至建筑用石和铺路石块。
    在苏维埃年代，许多新的矿产地被发现和勘查了，在以前知道的矿产地，勘查出来的蕴藏量也大大增加了。许多重要的矿物原料，包括铁、锰、煤、铜、铝土、镍、钨、铅、汞、云母、锌、钾盐等等，苏联的蕴藏量都在世界占第一位。在石油蕴藏量方面，苏联也是名列前茅。我国有丰富的水力资源，能在各地建设规模宏大的水电站，我国的森林资源也是雄厚的。
    谈到我们祖国的自然财富，应当指出这样一个优点，这些自然财富在苏联各个地区都有发现，都作了研究，并且在继续勘查。从我国的前途来看，只要生产力得到最合理的配置而且各个地区的经济都得到蓬勃的发展，我国宏伟的新面貌就会在远景中清楚地呈现出来。这将是苏维埃社会沿着共产主义道路协调发展的重要条件。
    让我们设想一下苏联的地图吧！
    我们以俄罗斯联邦为例。请看远东西伯利亚和东北各地区！在沙皇俄国时代，那里是偏僻、荒芜、渺无人烟的地区，经济和文化都很落后，往往被人称为荒野的“熊窝”。现在这些地区正在进行巨大的创造性工作，建立了大的工业中心和文化中心。这里还在建立新的科学中心——苏联科学院西伯利亚总分院。最近这里发现了许多矿藏，其中有巨大的锡矿、钼矿、铁矿、煤矿、菱镁矿。在雅库特自治共和国发现了储量达几十亿吨的炼焦煤矿，探明了极丰富的原生的和冲积的金刚石矿床，以及巨大的铁矿、金砂矿、锡矿和其他矿物。
    在我国的大经济区中间，乌拉尔占着重要的地位，即使在将来，它也拥有一切资源来进一步发展重工业的许多决定性部门。在伏尔加河和乌拉尔之间的广大地区，发现和探明了贮量丰富的石油，并在进行大规模的开采。几年来，巴什基尔自治共和国和鞑靼自治共和国大大提高了石油产量。现在，这两个共和国的石油产量都比整个沙皇俄国的石油产量多一倍多。伏尔加河上巨大水电站的兴建为进一步发展国民经济建立了强大的动力基地。
    由于查明了库尔斯克磁力异常区的丰富铁矿，拥有多种工业部门的我国中部地区，将有广阔的发展前途。这个苏联最大的铁矿区能为强大的冶金工业提供足够几百年使用的优质铁矿石；毫无疑问，它在进一步加强苏联工业的威力中，将起重要的作用。
    在我国经济的发展中起着巨大作用的乌克兰共和国，拥有强大的煤炭工业、冶金工业、化学工业、机器制造工业以及日益发展的动力基地。它拥有进一步发展经济所需要的丰富的天然资源。在铁矿石和锰矿石已知贮量和开采量居于前列地位的乌克兰南部各区，矿区大大扩大了，并且新发现了各种贵重矿石的产地，发现和勘探了新煤田——第聂伯煤田和利沃夫—沃林煤田。这些煤田和顿巴斯将使煤产量逐年增加。在最近几年内，在大规模的天然煤气产地的基础上，瓦斯工业将得到广泛的发展。
    哈萨克和中亚细亚地区的工业的进一步发展具有远大的前途，在苏维埃政权的年代里，由于共产党实行了列宁主义的民族政策，这些地区的面貌已经起了变化。在这里，现代工业的新部门建立起来了，农业生产水平大大提高了。在哈萨克发现了大量矿藏，有铁矿、煤矿、铬铁矿、高级铝土矿、各种有色金属和稀有金属矿以及许多其他种类的矿藏。现在，哈萨克的铜、铅、锌和钨约占苏联已经查明的全部蕴藏量的一半，今后有很大发展前途的钼，占全部蕴藏量的五分之一以上。哈萨克蕴藏有丰富的、种类繁多的天然资源，这些资源使我们有可能发展多
  部门的强大的工业。中亚细亚富产煤、石油、铜、铅、锑、水银、钨和其他矿产。
    白俄罗斯、摩尔达维亚、高加索和波罗的海沿岸各加盟共和国的工业，在原有的和在几个五年计划期间建立的工业中心的基础上，今后将更加顺利地发展，在发展工业的时候，不仅可利用各种各样的地方资源，并且还同国内其他经济地区建立广泛的生产合作。
    就这样简短的概述也能表明，苏维埃国家拥有一切必要条件来进一步全面发展各工业部门，进一步大大发展我们全国、各地区和各加盟共和国的经济。最近时期所实行的工业和建设管理的改组，加盟共和国、地方机关权力的扩大，领导和生产的接近，使我们能够更充分更合理地利用我们所拥有的资源，让这些资源为人民服务。
    苏共第二十次代表大会曾经指出，必须制定包括几个五年计划的发展我国经济和文化的远景计划。在这个计划中，我们计划部门所制定的一系列最重要部门的若干指标的初步数字表明，目前我国在发展国民经济方面可以向前迈进多么大的一步。
    现在我们来把表明目前苏联几种最重要产品生产水平的若干数字和表明最强大的资本主义国家美国这些产品的生产水平的数字比较一下。
    苏联1957年的铁矿石产量约为八千四百万吨，煤为四亿六千二百万吨（折合成硬煤为三亿九千五百万吨），石油为九千八百万吨，生铁为三千七百万吨以上，钢为五千一百万吨，电力为两千一百亿度，水泥约为两千九百万吨，砂糖超过四百五十万吨，毛织品超过两亿八千万公尺，皮鞋约三亿一千五百万双。
    美国1956年铁矿石产量为九千八百万吨，煤四亿七千九百万吨，石油三亿五千四百万吨，生铁六千九百万吨，钢一亿零四百五十万吨，电力六千八百四十亿度，水泥五千四百万吨，糖两百一十万吨，毛织品两亿九千九百万公尺，皮鞋五亿八千六百万双。
    从上面的数字可以看出，苏联在某些最重要产品的生产水平方面还比美国落后很多。但是应当说，现在美国的生产水平对我们来说已经不像二十五年、三十年前某些人所想像的那样望尘莫及了。目前就某些产品来说，比如，小麦、木料的采伐量和糖的生产量，苏联已经赶过了美国的生产水平。就铁矿石和煤、生铁和钢、某些机器和仪器、棉织品和毛织品的生产水平来说，两国的悬殊也大大地缩小了。苏联人民提出了一个完全可以实现的任务——在最近几年内在按人口计算的肉类、牛奶和油脂的产量方面赶上美国。
    根据有待明确规定的初步草案，约在十五年内苏联的工业品年产量可以达到这样的水平：铁矿——二亿五千万到三亿吨，生铁——七千五百万到八千五百万吨，钢——一亿到一亿二千万吨，煤——六亿五千万到七亿五千万吨，石油——一三亿五千万到四亿吨，煤气的开采和生产量——二千七百亿到三千二百亿立方公尺，电力——八千亿到九千亿度，水泥——九千万到一亿一千万吨，糖——九百万到一千万吨，毛织品——五亿五千万到六亿五千万公尺，皮鞋——六亿到七亿双。
    这是初步预计，在实际生活中可能有所修正。最可能的是实现草拟的计划的期限可能缩短。即使我们在实行计划经济方面有丰富的经验，也很难绝对精确地规定各部门生产发展的情况，特别是考虑到现代科学技术的蓬勃发展和我们干部的继续增加，会为加速发展社会生产提供补充的泉源。
    我们在提出大大增加金属生产时，所指的是要首先靠开采最近发现的铁矿藏来大力发展黑色冶金业的原料基地。在大规模扩大克里沃罗格盆地采矿工作的同时，还规定扩大库尔斯克磁铁矿、哈萨克和西伯利亚各矿产地的工作。苏联铁矿开采量最近几年就可以跃居世界第一位。
    必须特别注意在国民经济中更广泛地利用煤气和石油来代替煤。在这方面我们非常落后。只要指出下述情况就足以说明问题：在苏联各种基本燃料总开采量中，天然煤气只占4％左右，尽管我国天然煤气的蕴藏极为丰富。
    更好地利用石油和煤气有很大的好处。天然煤气和石油的开采是比较经济的。开采一吨天然煤气（折成标准燃料计算）的劳动消耗量，仅为开采一吨煤的劳动消耗量的二十分之一左右，而开采石油的劳动消耗量差不多只有开采煤的劳动消耗量的六分之一。天然煤气开采成本差不多只有煤的开采成本的十二分之一，石油开采成本约为煤的开采成本的七分之二。
    由于煤气有这样大的好处，我们打算在最近十年到十五年内把我国煤气的开采和生产增加到大约十三到十五倍。这样大大增加煤气的开采量，就不仅可以把煤气用作燃料，而且可以用来制造氮肥和其他许多种化学产品。
    在开采石油时附带开采出来的煤气，是化学工业最好的原料。
    此外，发展煤气工业就能够更广泛地开展城市和工人区的煤气装置工作。这就使千百万劳动者能够节省日常生活中非生产性的时间和劳动。除了在国内进行的大规模住宅建筑以外，在日常生活中广泛地使用煤气，将是使人民的物质生活得到改善的一个重要因素。这还能消除煤尘和煤烟染污城市和工人区空气的现象，大大改善居民的卫生条件。
    在进一步发展工业生产的迫切任务中，还必须提出关于发展化学工业的问题。我们要在最近几年内大大扩大矿物肥料的生产，建立强大的塑料、人造纤维及其他合成物质工业，以便使我们能够广泛地采用有色金属、植物原料和动物原料的代用品。这不仅能够解决工业和建筑业方面许多新的技术问题，而且能够大大地增加质量良好的日用品的生产，大大地降低日用品的生产成本。我们能够迅速地搞好塑料的生产，以这种物质作为机器制造业和建筑业中的金属代用品，这就能促进重工业的进一步发展。我们能够迅速扩大人造纤维、质量很高的皮革代用品和毛皮代用品的生产，以便除日益增长的天然农产原料以外，还能够获得大量的新的原料。
    现在，我国的重工业、机器制造业和科学技术的发展已经达到这样的程度：我们可以在不影响我国国防力量的加强、不影响重工业和机器制造业进一步发展的情况下，以大大加快的速度来发展轻工业，特别是为居民生产更多的鞋类和纺织品，以便在最近五年至七年内能够充分保证居民对这些商品的需要。
    现在我国正在解决苏共第二十次代表大会所规定的极其重要的任务——在技术上重新装备铁路运输业。党和政府将尽一切努力来实现一个广大的计划，使铁路电气化，并且用电动机车和内燃机车来代替旧的和不经济的蒸汽机车。这样，我们就可以改进全部运输工作，把运输工作提到更高的阶段。
      我国具有相当有利的条件来全面发展多部门的社会主义农业。
      开垦生荒地和熟荒地在增加谷物生产和畜产品方面是一个巨大的贡献。俄罗斯联邦许多地区的农业工作者，特别是西伯利亚和乌拉尔的农业工作者，展开了进一步开垦生荒地和熟荒地的工作。完成这一工作的办法，主要是依靠更好地利用机器拖拉机站和国营农场的现有技术。
    在社会主义农业已取得的成就的基础上，并且考虑到它的巨大潜力，在最近几年中我们应当争取大大增加谷物和畜产品的产量。为了按照苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决定，把谷物的年产量增加到一百一十亿普特，我们还要做许多工作。至于谈到畜牧业发展的前途，我们的任务就是在最近几年内在按人口计算的肉类、奶类和油脂的产量方面赶上美国。这就是说，按照目前的人口情况，我们需要把肉类的产量增加到两千万到两千一百万吨，奶类的产量增加到七千万吨。
    今后我们需要更大规模地生产谷物和畜产品，以充分地满足国家日益增长的需求和对外贸易的需要。集体农庄和国营农场在最近几年中应当增加棉花、甜菜和其他技术作物的产量，以及水果、葡萄、柑桔和茶叶的产量。我们主要的注意力必须放在提高耕作技术以及增加乌克兰、北高加索、中央黑土地带和我国其他地区的单位面积产量上。
    关于农业发展的前途，我们应当注意如何利用远东的广大富源。目前，当我们已经能够以高度的技术装备农业的时候，开拓远东土地富源已成为现实的任务。如果我们能够解决这个任务（无疑地我们是能够解决这个任务的），那么，远东就能出产大量的商品农产品。
      现在社会主义成分已成为供应全国一切产品的基本成分，我国人民正在解决向共产主义过渡的历史任务，因此不仅在工业中，而且在农业中提高劳动生产率的问题就提到了首要地位。减少单位产品生产的劳动消耗量，在目前共产主义建设阶段具有头等重要的意义。大家知道，党正在实行提高人民物质福利的宏伟纲领。今后，这方面的工作在很大程度上有赖于降低农产品成本，这样才有实际可能来不断降低物价。所以现在不仅要按产量，而且要按生产成本来评价集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作。列宁正是这样提出问题的，他要求深入研究社会主义经济，精打细算，最大限度地利用现有的一切可能性。
    同志们，我们的计划工作人员的计算表明，在各种最重要的产品产量方面，苏维埃国家在今后十五年内不仅能赶上，并且能超过目前的美国。自然，在这段时期，美国的经济也可能有所发展。但是，只要考虑到我国工业发展速度比美国快得多这一点，那末可以肯定，在极短的历史时期内，在和平竞赛中赶过美国的这一任务是完全现实的，是完全可以实现的。
    可以相信，我们苏联人民将尽一切努力争取在和平竞赛中获得胜利。
    我们在最近的将来进一步发展社会主义工业和农业的计划，体现了共产党和苏联政府对苏联人民的福利和幸福的关怀。在今后十五年内，具有决定意义的工业部门将扩大约一、两倍，农业将迅速发展，这就有可能大大提高人民的生活水平，更充分地满足苏联人民不断增长的物质和文化需要。
    苏联人民在发展国民经济方面取得了巨大的成绩，他们正确估计这些成绩的意义，同时也很了解我们还有悬而未决的问题，还有缺点，还会遇到必须克服的严重困难。
    我们知道，我们的住宅非常缺乏，缺乏住宅的原因是容易理解的。首先，苏维埃政权从旧制度接受下来的就是住宅极端缺乏的局面。第二，在苏维埃政权年代中，城市和工人镇的居民增加到三倍半以上。第三，在战前的年代中我们不得不一切从简、其中也包括住宅的建设，把每一个戈比都用于建设重工业。第四，战争使苏联的住宅总数遭到巨大的损失，使二千五百万人无家可归。
    即使如此，我国城市住宅总数仍增加为1913年的三·七倍。在苏维埃政权年代中新建和修复了总面积达五亿多平方公尺的住宅（农民和农村知识分子建筑的房屋未计算在内）。但是我们不愿意满足于同过去比较，同成百万没有房屋的人无栖身之处、而成千万人住在贫民窟中的“富裕”资本主义国家比较。
    在共产党和苏联政府对提高人民物质福利的一切关怀中，对扩大住宅建设的关怀现在占有极重要的地位。
    党和政府拟定的苏联住宅建设发展纲领，得到全体人民的热烈赞同，这一纲领提出了保障住宅面积大大增加的任务，以便在最近十年到十二年内消灭国内住宅不足现象。没有疑问，我国的住宅问题将在最近几年内成功地得到解决。
    我们也知道，我们一系列日用品的生产，在量的方面，特别是在质的方面，都还是落后的，这些商品中有许多的成本和价格还是高的。
    必须大力进行工作，来进一步改进生产，使生产专业化、全盘机械化和自动化以及提高劳动修养，以便使劳动生产率能够大大提高，并在这个基础上保证劳动人民的工资继续提高。最近期间，必须实行一系列措施来调整工资制度，消除某些行业工作人员的劳动报酬分配上的现有缺点，确立工资等级和工资率的更加合理的对比关系。应当更加重视改善城乡贸易、改善公共饮食业以及对居民的生活福利、医疗和文化服务等问题。关心满足劳动人民的日常需要，是党组织、苏维埃机关、经济组织、合作社和工会组织的首要责任。
    在我国发展的现阶段，即当苏联人民的忘我劳动使国民经济的发展达到了高度水平的时候，已经创造了必要的条件，以更快的速度提高劳动人民的福利。我们相信，这一任务也一定能够圆满解决，像党和苏维埃国家过去所提出的一切任务一一解决一样。
    科学技术的发展水平越高，科学技术与生活、与共产主义建设的联系越密切，我们前进的速度也就越快。
    现在就连我们的敌人也承认，在科学技术发展方面、在国民经济各个部门技术装备的水平方面、在现有的高度熟练的专家干部方面，苏联占居世界前列地位。现在，苏联的科学和技术、苏联的工业已经使得我们没有不能单独用自己本身力量来解决的生产技术问题了。苏维埃国家已经达到了这样一个高度的科学技术和生产水平，使它能够日益广泛地利用它的资源，以从前所不能梦想的速度发展生产力。
    实际上，二十年前能想像在这样短的期间内建成像现在我们在伏尔加河、安加拉河、叶尼塞河建设的那样一些规模宏大的水电站吗？难道从前在两三年内能够解决开垦三千六百万公顷荒地这样巨大的任务吗？十年十五年前，像和平利用原子能，制造快速喷气式飞机、洲际弹道火箭、人造地球卫星这样一些问题被认为是遥远的未来的事。现在，正在实际解决当代这些复杂问题，而苏联科学家和我国工业对这些问题的解决作出自己应有的贡献。现在，我们有一切理由说，在发展科学方面，苏联在世界占有应得的一席。
    共产党和苏联政府今后仍将尽一切努力，使我们的科学技术全力发展，使多民族的社会主义文化繁荣，使科学技术成就更快地应用到生产中，减轻苏联人的劳动，提高他们的劳动生产率。
      同志们！共产党和苏联政府在解决我国现阶段所面临的共产主义建设任务中的作用是巨大的。
    领导经济和文化建设，一贯地提高人民福利，组织、团结和动员全体劳动人民去实现向共产主义的过渡，教育广大群众具备共产主义觉悟，这几项工作就决定了共产党和苏联政府的主要活动方向。
    大家知道，苏联社会主义社会的建成，导致了国家生活的深刻政治变化，剥削阶级的消灭，人民精神上政治上团结的形成，苏维埃国家职能的改变和发展。早先，在苏联社会主义胜利以前，镇压剥削阶级及其国内残余的敌对活动，镇压被推翻的统治阶级恢复资本主义秩序的努力，是苏维埃国家最重要的职能之一，而在国内剥削阶级消灭和社会主义生产关系巩固以后，这一职能就逐渐消逝了。
    随着苏维埃社会沿着共产主义道路继续前进，苏维埃社会主义国家的职能今后仍将日臻完善和改变其面貌。
    社会主义不是一个什么固定一成不变的东西。社会主义是一个生气蓬勃、不断发展和臻于完善的社会，这个社会经常竭力最充分地满足社会全体成员不断增长的物质和文化需要。同样。社会主义国家也不能保持固定一成不变的形式。不是的，它也在随着向共产主义的前进而不断发展，不断改变其面貌。
    社会主义民主、真正的劳动人民的民主政治，在国内得到了越来越广泛越充分的发展。近几年来采取了一些措施，进一步扩大加盟共和国在经济和文化建设中的权力、发挥地方的主动性、改组工业管理、把领导企业和建设工程的重心转移到各经济区，这些措施是发展社会主义民主的重大步骤。这些措施有助于进一步发挥全体苏联人的主动性和积极性，有助于更广泛地吸引他们参予国家、经济和文化建设的管理。
      劳动人民的社会主义国家现在最主要的职能是，组织社会生产和领导经济、各种事业和文化，为劳动人民的利益而控制劳动量和消费量；对劳动人民进行全面教育，其中包括培养新的劳动纪律和共产主义的劳动态度；在外交政策方面，始终不渝地执行列宁关于社会政治制度不同的国家和平共处和巩固和平的方针；加强世界社会主义体系各国的牢不可破的友谊、兄弟合作和互相帮助。
    列宁教导说，要国家完全消亡，就需要彻底实现共产主义，只有到了共产主义的最高阶段，当社会上实行了“各尽所能，各取所需”的原则，在高度的劳动生产率的基础上一切产品都非常充裕的时候，当劳动已成为最主要的生活需要，人们都能够自愿地尽其所能进行劳动的时候，国家才会完全消亡。
      当然，我们也还不能忘记社会主义国家的一个重要的职能，即保卫自己的国家，不受外来的侵略，保卫社会主义制度，不受外国帝国主义势力及其代理人为资本主义复辟而进行的侵略。我们国家的这个职能的重要性，不只是取决于我们自己，甚至与其说取决于我们自己，还不如说取决于我们的敌人。外来侵略的威胁越小，我们在实现我们国家的这个职能方面所耗费的人力和财力也就越少，反之亦然。
    马克思列宁主义关于国家的学说，关于国家随着社会走向完全的共产主义而逐渐消亡的学说，有着巨大的意义。从苏联的内部发展着眼，把用于国防、用于使社会主义不受敌人及其代理人进犯的国家机关的大量开支，用来更迅速地发展经济，提高人民的生活水平，这是完全可能和非常适宜的。但是，很遗憾，帝国主义国家的统治集团的敌对政策和行动不允许我们这样做。
    为了解决共产主义建设任务而进行和平的创造性劳动的苏联人民并没有忘记：帝国主义国家还存在，这些国家的统治集团还没有放弃消灭社会主义的妄想。对社会主义敌人的阴谋和他们发动新战争的企图保持高度的政治警惕性，全力加强我国的国防和武装力量，随时准备反击帝国主义侵略者的进攻，这始终是苏维埃社会主义国家所特别关心的事情。
    受到全体人民的关怀和爱戴的苏联陆海军是无比强大的，因为苏联军人具有高度的道德品质，对自己的爱国主义天职有深刻的理解，对社会主义祖国无限忠诚。我们苏联陆海军的力量和威力的主要源泉，正如不久前举行的苏共中央全会的决议中所强调指出的，在于共产党是它的组织者、领导者和教导者。为了保卫我们的祖国，必须为实现苏共第二十次代表大会的指示进行顽强的斗争。这些指示就是：使社会主义国家的国防保持现代军事技术科学的水平，不懈地提高军事素养，改进陆海军中党和政治工作，警惕地捍卫苏联人民的和平劳动和社会主义的伟大成果。
    我国各族人民的牢不可破的团结一致，他们在发展经济和文化中的友好互助，生气勃勃的苏维埃爱国主义，苏联人建成共产主义的坚定决心，他们为祖国从事的忘我劳动，这就是具有历史意义的共产主义建设任务必将胜利完成的保证。
    在全世界赢得了创造者——人民和英雄——人民的荣誉的苏联人民的力量在于，半个多世纪以来领导他们为自由和幸福、为共产主义的崇高理想而进行斗争的是伟大的列宁建立起来的、在为社会主义而进行的战斗中锻炼出来的共产党，是为百战百胜的马克思列宁主义学说鼓舞的共产党。现在，它正领导人民为完成共产主义建设任务而努力。
    苏维埃国家是在新的历史形势下，在伟大的中国人民、所有社会主义国家的劳动人民同苏联人民一同前进的形势下，来解决这些任务的。社会主义各国人民的兄弟友谊和互助，他们的马克思列宁主义政党的团结，使人类能够非常迅速地沿着社会主义、进步、和平和繁荣的道路前进。
    在列宁领导下建立起来的忠于自己的国际主义职责的苏维埃社会主义国家，将尽全力来在建设社会主义和共产主义的斗争中，扩大和加强同一切社会主义国家的人民的牢不可破的友谊，发展卓有成效的合作。
     （三）十月革命的国际意义，世界社会主义力量的增长
      同志们！
    过去的四十年发生了许多具有极伟大历史意义的事件，许多国家在社会经济方面发生了根本的变化，这样的四十年是世界历史上从来没有过的。作为这四十年的标志的是：民主和社会主义力量凯歌行进，许多国家和民族摆脱了殖民主义和帝国主义的枷锁。十月革命的胜利掀起了席卷全世界的强大的革命解放的浪潮。
    国际反动派曾一度扑灭了西方一些国家的革命火焰，暂时推延了殖民体系的崩溃。但是反动派没有力量消灭苏维埃革命播下的种子，现在已经没有任何东西能够阻止伟大十月革命思想的胜利。
    过去的四十年是世界共产主义运动和工人运动既广又深地蓬勃发展的时期。在革命斗争中，强大的马克思列宁主义政党产生、成长起来，并且得到了锻炼。目前，它们共拥有三千三百多万党员。
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁着重指出了十月革命的经验的国际意义，他说：这个经验“已经作为社会主义的成果载入史册，未来的国际革命，将根据这个经验建设自己的社会主义大厦。”（“列宁全集”俄文版第二十七卷第三七七页）历史发展的进程完全证实了列宁的预言。
    在第二次世界大战时期和第二次世界大战结束后不久，欧亚两洲的一些国家发生了人民民主革命，出现了一些社会主义国家，现在它们正胜利地向前发展。中国革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立是伟大的十月革命后最重大的历史事件。现在，阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、越南民主共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫的人民都在建设社会主义的道路上前进着。这些国家的劳动人民过去和现在都根据十月革命的经验建设着社会主义的大厦。
    世界社会主义体系的产生，是国际共产主义运动和工人运动的最伟大成果，是马克思列宁主义的胜利。这个伟大的胜利是工人阶级和劳动农民英勇奋斗的结果，是各国共产党和工人党进行革命斗争，结合本国的具体条件巧妙地创造性地运用马克思列宁主义学说的结果。
    世界社会主义阵营现在是一种蒸蒸日上的伟大的力量。在世界经济中，社会主义阵营的采煤量占全部采煤量的37％以上，生铁和钢的产量约占四分之一，棉花产量约占三分之一。社会主义国家的工业生产量约占世界工业总生产量的三分之一。
    现在存在两个世界体系——社会主义体系和资本主义体系。每个体系有它独特的发展规律。
    列宁教导说，经济和政治发展不平衡是资本主义的必然规律。在资本主义社会中，经济不可能平衡地发展，生产无政府状态、危机、垄断组织之间和资本主义国家之间的勾心斗角的激烈竞争是它不可避免的伴侣。在资本主义制度下，实力原则起支配作用。由此产生凭借威胁、强迫、发动战争、掠夺别人的领土、原料产地和销售市场来解决矛盾的倾向。如果个别资本主义国家能够走在前面，那是由于它们靠一小撮资本主义垄断组织掠夺了千百万劳动者，残酷地剥削了殖民地和半殖民地国家。走在帝国主义国家最前列的是美国，现在西德正在挤开英国、法国和其他资本主义国家而赶到前面去。弱肉强食，金钱万能，这就是资本主义的规律。
    世界社会主义体系国家之间的关系则完全不同。在这里起作用的是有计划的经济发展的规律。旨在最大限度地满足人民日益增长的需要的社会主义社会的经济发展的特点是：生产力迅速提高，国民财富不断增多。所有的社会主义国家，不问大小，不问在社会主义道路上已走得很远还是不久前才踏上这条道路，都是完全平等的。它们中间没有一个国家要追求某种优势和某种特权。一个社会主义国家的经验可以成为另一个国家的财富，每一个国家的成就不仅加强了这个国家，而且也加强了整个社会主义阵营。
    苏联首先建成了社会主义。苏联积累了丰富的经验，并且把它的经验介绍给所有的兄弟国家，帮助它们建设新生活。其他的社会主义国家在经济和文化建设方面也都具有丰富的宝贵的经验，它们也很愿意把自己的经验介绍给苏联，帮助苏联。
    人民制度的胜利、兄弟的互助和社会主义工业化政策的贯彻执行，使得许多国家的人民摆脱了资本主义遗留下来的经济落后的困境。社会主义国家的巨大成就使苏联人和社会主义的所有的朋友都欢欣鼓舞。中华人民共和国成立以来，工业产量差不多增加为六倍。人民中国建立起强大的现代化工业、成为工业强国的日子已经不远了。捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫和阿尔巴尼亚在发展工业方面也都取得了巨大成就。
    社会主义国家在根据社会主义原则改造农业方面的成就是显著的。苏联沿着列宁所指示的道路，根据社会主义原则改造了自己的农业。现在，中华人民共和国也正在顺利地解决这一任务，它已经完成了农业合作化。保加利亚农业中的社会主义成分占耕地面积的87％，捷克斯洛伐克占土地面积的60％，罗马尼亚占全部农业用地的42％以上。其他人民民主国家也都在实行农业的社会主义改造。
    经济发展非常迅速是社会主义国家的特点。社会主义国家1956年的工业产量，同它们本国1937年的生产水平相比，增加为四倍以上。目前，世界社会主义体系已拥有高度发达的工业基地，因此社会主义国家有可能更迅速地发展自己的经济，不断提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    伟大的社会主义大家庭各国团结的基础是什么呢？
    国家制度和社会制度的原则的共同性、马克思列宁主义思想的一致、无产阶级的国际主义、社会主义建设伟大目标的一致、平等和互助、保卫每一个国家和整个世界社会主义体系的民族独立和革命成果、保卫和平和各国人民的安全——这就是发展这个兄弟大家庭的基础。
    各个社会主义国家的马克思列宁主义的共产党和工人党是这些国家的领导力量。目前，整个发展进程正在工人阶级革命政党的面前把争取在马克思列宁主义基础上加强团结和发展各种合作提到了首要地位。忠于社会主义国际主义原则的共产党和工人党，正在为加强自己的队伍，为反对修正主义倾向，反对民族狭隘和民族疏远这种种有害的偏见而进行斗争。
    帝国主义者使用他们“分而治之”的老办法，利用形形色色的民族主义偏见来反对社会主义阵营，在所谓“民族共产主义”的幌子下，进行思想上的破坏活动。帝国主义的思想家及其代理人企图撒播沙文主义和资产阶级民族主义的毒种，唆使社会主义国家互相对立。
    某些自命为共产主义者的人士上了这种宣传的当，他们拥护社会主义，但是却不要无产阶级专政，不要工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党对社会生活的领导，不要实现无产阶级国际主义的原则。我们的敌人把这种政策称为“自由主义的共产主义”，从而流露出了他们想把共产党人变为普通的资产阶级自由主义者这种暗藏的愿望。现代修正主义的道路通向何处，从德热拉斯和纳吉·伊姆雷的例子中便可以看出来，他们直接背叛了社会主义事业，出卖了本国根本的民族利益。击溃这些社会主义的敌人的政治阵地和思想阵地，有助于加强这些国家的社会主义和整个社会主义体系的事业。
    在现代修正主义者的武库中，还包括对资产阶级民主的颂扬。这是他们从第二国际的机会主义者那里搬来的、人人熟知的老手法。当时，叛徒考茨基、孟什维克分子和社会革命党人就曾经从这个立场上进行了反对列宁和反对年轻的苏维埃共和国的残酷斗争。右翼社会党领袖中的“贤哲”以及同他们串通一气的现代修正主义者的议论大概是这样：如果共产党人在他们执政的国家里，容许有反对社会主义制度的敌对政治活动的话，那时我们就承认他们那里有自由，我们就将赞扬他们。
    但是，让修正主义者为了这种事而赞扬共产党人，那是不行的！我们是站在加强和发展社会主义国家、发扬社会主义民主而不是资产阶级民主这样的列宁主义立场上，而且我们决不离开列宁主义的立场！
    社会主义国家在过渡时期中建设的国际经验，特别是匈牙利同反革命叛乱斗争的教训说明，工人阶级应当善于保护自己的政权不受内外敌人的侵害，劳动人民的国家应当实现对社会主义建设的领导，发扬和加强社会主义民主。
    在今天的条件下，社会主义国家已经有了多种形式。但应当强调指出，没有马克思列宁主义政党，社会主义国家就不可能存在，工人阶级就不可能组织成为社会的领导力量，工人阶级和农民的牢不可破的联盟就没有保证，建设社会主义社会的任务就不能胜利完成。
    弗·伊·列宁曾经指出，一切民族和国家都将走到社会主义，但是走法并不一样，在民主的形式方面，在无产阶级专政的形式方面，在社会生活各方面的社会主义改造的速度方面，每个国家都会有自己的特点。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会强调指出，一切沿着社会主义道路前进的国家发展的历史经验，完全证实了列宁的这一原理。
    有些人企图抓住列宁关于向社会主义过渡有多种形式，建设社会主义有多种方法的原理以及第二十次党代表大会的有关决议。他们用自己的观点来理解这些原理，他们说，既然列宁已经指出过，而且第二十次党代表大会又肯定了和进一步发展了列宁关于建设社会主义的多种形式和方法的原理，因此各社会主义国家就不必一致了。持有这种观点的人说，每个国家似乎可以通过自己独特的、同其他社会主义国家毫无共同之处的道路走向社会主义。
    科学社会主义的理论考虑到、而且也不能不考虑到各国的历史特点，这些特点在某种程度上决定了社会主义建设的形式和方法。这是不言而喻的。任何一个真正站在革命立场的人，都不会设想在建设社会主义时可以忽视各国发展中的社会经济特点和历史特点。如果从马克思列宁主义的立场出发，那末应提到首位的就不是各国所具有的某种特点，而是构成争取社会主义的斗争基础的主要之点、共同之点。
    社会主义建设实践中的差别可以表现在创造这种或那种生产管理形式、这种或那种农业合作化的方法的问题上面，但是消灭生产资料私有制，农民实行合作化，这是共同的。没有这一点，社会主义制度就不可能顺利发展。大家知道，在中华人民共和国，工业管理问题是采取适应本国具体条件的方法解决的，既不同于苏联，也不同于，譬如捷克斯洛伐克。虽然具体的管理形式有多种多样，但始终不渝地实行马克思列宁主义的社会主义建设原则这一主要之点是不可动摇的。
      社会主义的威望在劳动人民中间已经大大提高，社会主义思想已经深入人心，以致社会主义的最有眼光的敌人和资本主义信徒现在也得容忍社会主义这个字眼了，不过他们作了一点小的补充，说是什么“民族社会主义”或“民族共产主义”。
    我们的阶级敌人感到要同团结一致的、坚如磐石的社会主义国家阵线较量是很困难的。于是他们打算把社会主义国家各个击破，以便削弱整个世界社会主义体系。
    社会主义的敌人希望共产党人纷纷去寻找每一个国家走向社会主义的某些“崭新的”、人为的道路。而把苏联、中国和其他国家现有的社会主义建设的伟大经验置诸脑后。他们建议单独地，也就是分散地、各管各地、通过不同的道路走向社会主义。如果接受这种观点，恐怕就会出现非常多的“道路”，使人像走入森林一样迷失方向，不知道怎样才能达到自己的伟大目标。然而这种指望注定是要落空的。共产党和工人党识破了社会主义敌人的阴谋，给他们以坚决的回击。它们坚定地站在马克思列宁主义的立场上，不会离开正确的道路。
    从内部破坏社会主义运动，分化社会主义国家和党，使它们互相冲突，这种做法是帝国主义及其代理人同世界社会主义体系作斗争的最巧妙的形式之一。这是主要的危险之一，我们必须同它进行最坚决的斗争。
    通向社会主义的康庄大道已经铺平，社会主义建设的基本形式和方法已经经过实际生活和许多社会主义国家的经验的考验。应当使这些形式和方法更加完善，应当掌握和总结积累起来的丰富经验、群众创造的经验，应当充实它，结合每一个国家、每一个民族的条件不断地发展它，应当加强而不是动摇社会主义阵营，这样，社会主义社会就将突破一切障碍和一切困难而不断地发展和壮大。
    帝国主义集团及其代理人在攻击社会主义国家和它们的团结时，把主要的矛头对准苏联。为什么呢？因为苏联是最强大的社会主义国家。它的范例对国际共产主义运动和工人运动，对为民族解放和社会解放而斗争的殖民地人民的影响是巨大的。帝国主义者害怕苏维埃国家的强盛，害怕马克思列宁主义思想。因此，他们千方百计地诽谤苏联的经验，从而也就在诽谤马克思列宁主义的伟大思想。
    因此，革命的政党和一切坚持马克思列宁主义的阶级立场的革命者，都认为自己的神圣职责是加强国际主义的联系，全力支持苏联、中华人民共和国和一切社会主义国家，加强一切社会主义国家的团结，加强一切革命力量的团结。
    同志们！现在社会主义对全世界历史的进程正起着巨大的、日益强烈的影响，正在改变世界的面貌。实际生活证实了马克思主义的一个伟大真理，即社会主义为社会的迅速发展创造了可能。现代资本主义可以用什么来同社会主义较量呢？社会主义国家的生产量从1937年到1956年增加到四倍以上，而资本主义世界虽然用尽一切人为的“打气”的办法，包括无限制的军备竞赛在内，却仅仅把生产量增加了一倍。但是问题还不仅在这里。
    资本主义的总危机在继续尖锐化，使资本主义世界分裂的敌对矛盾正在加深。资本主义国家之间以及资本主义国家内部劳动和资本之间的斗争，正在以新的形式发展。资本主义的总危机也表现在常年失业和企业开工不足的现象上，表现在生产过剩和许多资本主义国家中时时发生的危机现象上。在资本主义的总危机时代，军国主义——这个现代资本主义社会的癌瘤的猖獗是侵略性的帝国主义政治和经济的不可分的特征。
    必遭历史唾弃的资本主义制度已经没有可能在其发展中提出能够鼓舞和吸引千百万人的目标了。资本家们为了苟延残喘，于是就采用极为巧妙的伪装和欺骗手法，求助于“人民资本主义”，“民主资本”，“普遍幸福”的资产阶级国家等等骗人的词句。但是，不论是资本主义卫士放出廉价的宣传圈套，还是甚至帝国主义者企图以武力阻止社会主义的发展，都不可能阻止历史发展的进程。
    改良主义者颂扬现代资本主义，把四十年来在某些资本主义国家中出现的社会立法说得天花乱坠。但是，这里他们却掩盖了这样一个主要的事实：如果说资本家也作了某些让步，那末这些让步是工人阶级用不屈不挠的斗争争取来的。社会主义各国取得的成就鼓舞着资本主义各国的劳动人民对剥削者进行斗争，同时迫使尚在力图保住自己统治的资产阶级作一些社会经济性质的让步。关于这方面，不能不令人回忆起优秀的美国作家西奥多·德莱塞的话，他就三十年代在美国出现社会立法这件事说过：“这一切我都要感谢马克思和红色俄国”。
    在帝国主义国家里，剥削日益加重，劳动人民的生活水平和民主权利受到进攻，法西斯和战争的危险不断加深。但是在这些国家里有工人阶级，有其他阶层的劳动人民和进步的知识分子，也就是说有着总的说来是站在社会主义和民主立场上争取和平的人民力量，毫无疑问，未来是属于这些力量的。
    资本主义总危机的加深特别明显地表现在殖民体系的崩溃上面。潮流的趋向是，这个可耻制度将彻底消灭。印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、埃及、叙利亚和很多其他国家都获得了解放。摆脱了殖民压迫的东方国家正在寻找迅速复兴本国经济和文化的道路。在所有的殖民地和附属国中，人民争取民族独立和自由的运动日益壮大。
    不久前还处于殖民地或半殖民地地位的国家，目前不仅希望政治上获得解放，而且也力求摆脱使这些国家从属于资本主义国家的经济桎梏。美英帝国主义集团之间正在为在殖民地和半殖民地国家中的影响而进行残酷斗争。殖民者被迫退出了某些国家，但是他们在那里扶植了出身于资产阶级和封建势力的帮凶。这些殖民者的帮凶好像是站在维护本国利益的立场上，实际上却执行着帝国主义侵略者的政策。
    现在出现了另一种形式的殖民政策，这种政策主要是由美国推行的。在英、法、以色列侵略埃及的军事冒险破产以后，美国帝国主义者提出了“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”，宣称中东似乎形成了“真空”，他们的使命就是填补这一真空。
    但是大家知道，中东根本没有什么“真空”，那里适于生活的土地住着大量居民，勤劳的阿拉伯各族人民——文化悠久的人民，在那里居住和劳动，取得了大自然的恩赐。殖民者的“真空”理论实际上是帝国主义者蔑视阿拉伯各族人民，拒绝承认阿拉伯各国的独立，以为这些国家理应受英法殖民者的支配，或者受来自美国的殖民者的支配。阿拉伯东方各族人民既要同英法帝国主义斗争，也要同美国帝国主义斗争，他们懂得，一切帝国主义者对他们都是致命的危险。现在美国帝国主义者正在对叙利亚进行一连串的阴谋活动。他们正利用以色列来玩这一卑鄙的把戏，唆使土耳其去冒险和挑衅。
    帝国主义者企图用种种手段来维持他们在亚非国家的统治。当然，殖民者还拥有不小的力量，不能够低估威胁着东方各国人民的危险。然而，确定不移的历史事实说明，帝国主义在东方统治的末日已经到来了。
    苏联的榜样（它的中亚细亚各个繁荣的苏维埃共和国成了东方的社会主义灯塔）的伟大吸引力，中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的榜样，鼓舞着东方各民族为争取自由和独立而斗争。一贯执行正义的、符合一切爱好和平人民利益的政策的苏联和一切社会主义国家是亚洲和非洲各国人民的无私的朋友。
    我国从成立初期开始，就在国际关系中断然地摒弃了一切以掠夺、暴力和侵略为基础的做法，坚定地宣布了同世界各国睦邻相处以及保持平等经济联系的原则。
    列宁1917年11月8日在苏维埃第二次代表大会上论证和平法令的条文时说：“我们拒绝一切关于掠劫和暴力的条款，但是，凡是关于友善条件和经济协定的条款，我们都是乐于接受的，这样的条款我们决不能拒绝。”（列宁全集第二十六卷第二百二十三页）
    我国从苏维埃国家产生的时刻开始，就把各个不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则当作我国对外政策的基础。列宁在1918年就嘲笑那种有害的思想，似乎世界革命的利益决不允许同帝国主义者媾和。当时他写道：“按照这种观点，社会主义共和国在帝国主义列强之间是连任何经济条约也不能缔结的，假若不飞到月球上去，那就简直无法生存了。”（“列宁文选”中文版两卷集下卷第三三二页）社会主义和资本主义生存在同一个星球上，因此它们的共处是历史的必然性。
    我们奉行同资本主义国家和平共处的政策，主张为了巩固和平缔结双边友好协定，也缔结欧洲亚洲集体安全协定。
    著名的五项原则——相互尊重领土完整和主权，互不侵犯，互不因经济原因、政治原因和思想原因而干涉彼此的内政，平等互惠与和平共处——是各种制度不同的国家之间关系的基础。需要承认这样一个事实：目前存在着社会主义国家和资本主义国家，它们走着自己的道路，这些国家内部的现存制度是这些国家人民的内部问题。各国关系之间的争端应当通过谈判解决，而不应当诉诸战争。不要战争，在和平竞赛中生活，这就是和平共处的基础。
    苏联始终不渝地奉行着和平政策，力求同西方国家就有关裁军方面的各个问题达成彼此都能接受的协议。苏联准备大大裁减武装力量和军备，禁止原子武器和氢武器，立即停止试验这类武器并建立国际监督，只要西方国家也采取同样措施。目前，问题并不在我们国家这方面。
    一切国家、首先是拥有最强大的经济和军事力量的苏联和美国，如果能实事求是地和本着合作和互相谅解的精神求得重要的国际问题（其中包括裁军问题）的解决，那么，防止新战争以及建立各国之间和各国人民间的持久的巩固的和平的可能性就会大大增加。苏联将坚定不渝地遵循缓和国际紧张局势的方针，遵循改善同各国的关系包括同美国的关系的方针，因为苏美两国的相互谅解，会对改善整个国际局势起决定性的影响。在这方面，我们希望在不损害其他国家的利益，不使美国同英、法及其他国家的关系恶化的情况下改善我们两国之间的关系。不但如此，我们国家还希望同一切反对战争、主张和平共处的国家保持良好的关系，我们正在尽一切努力来建立这种关系。要做到这一步，正确的道路就是放弃“实力地位”政策，因为这个政策的最高阶段便是战争。
    甚至像苏联发射人造地球卫星这样的事，帝国主义也要用来为自己的目的服务。他们大叫大嚷，乱敲警钟，说苏联发射卫星是对和平的威胁，是在用新武器威胁资本主义国家。
    我们郑重声明，我国人民从来没有想过、而且今后也不想采用任何毁灭性的武器，只要我国不遭到帝国主义国家的袭击。我们知道，既然苏联能够依靠科学家、工程师和工人的努力造成地球卫星，那末，其他国家，特别像美国这样非常发达的国家也可能造成同样的东西。当然，我国已取得的成就具有很大的意义，因为我们在同资本主义国家的竞赛中赢得了时间。但是第一个取得这种成绩的国家不应当煽起使“冷战”气氛趋于紧张的狂热情绪，从而造成扩充军备的条件。大家知道，“实力地位”政策、扩充军备方面的竞赛会引起战争，而在现代的条件下，战争会带来难以计算的牺牲，会造成大量物质财富的毁灭。
  美国和英国的政府要人不久前举行了单独的会谈，他们不是想办法缓和紧张局势，相反地，是想办法加剧紧张局势，继续扩充军备。我们希望资本主义国家和社会主义国家举行高级会谈，以便在考虑现实情况和互相谅解的基础上，宣布不用战争作为解决国际问题的方法，停止冷战和军备竞赛，在共处的基础上建立国与国之间的关系，不是通过战争，而是通过和平谈判，通过发展经济、文化和更好地满足人们的精神和物质需求方面的和平竞赛来解决争端。
    一切兄弟共产党和工人党以及保持马克思列宁主义观点的社会党，都采取这样的立场。某些资产阶级政党也主张和平共处。
    现在，爱好和平的各国人民感到不安，这不是没有理由的，因为现在的“竞赛”是朝向另一个方向。美国总统和英国首相不久前的会谈表明，这两个主要资本主义国家的统治集团仍然坚持执行“实力地位”政策。从这次会谈后发表的公报可以清楚地看到，英美统治集团借口所谓苏联威胁的加强，共同商定要继续煽动“冷战”，增加制造杀人武器的军事拨款，进行战争准备。
    12月间，参加北大西洋侵略集团的各国政府的首脑将举行会谈，这对于和平事业并不是什么吉兆。值得注意的是：其中一些国家的政府过去或现在是由社会党的领袖领导的。这些政党自命为社会主义政党，其实它们奉行的是帝国主义集团的政策。它们把工人阶级引入迷途，竭力把事情说成似乎苏联不愿意就裁军和缓和国际紧张局势的问题达成协议，因此它们不得不继续进行军备竞赛。但是，这是对劳动人民的欺骗。帝国主义者巧妙地利用了社会党某些领袖的这种政策。
    美英两国政府的首脑艾森豪威尔先生和麦克米伦先生曾邀请北大西洋公约集团的现任秘书长、比利时社会党的著名人物斯巴克先生举行会谈，这并不是偶然的。事实表明，帝国主义者正在加紧使右翼社会党人参加备战的反人民勾当。
    无论帝国主义者采取什么手法，他们的诡计是注定要破产的。人民不愿意战争，他们警惕地保卫着和平，他们始终反对国际反动派的侵略阴谋。
    苏联过去和现在都主张世界和平，它将尽一切努力防止新战争的威胁。我们今后仍将争取裁军，禁止大规模毁灭人类的武器，造成各国人民相互信任的气氛，把联合国变成真正的和平工具。
    最为侵略成性的帝国主义集团力图在可能制造冲突的地方制造冲突，加紧军事威胁，从而使社会主义国家的相当一部分人力和物力不能用于建设性的劳动。侵略集团的策略就是，在社会主义国家周围建立自己的军事基地，拼凑和扩大军事集团。
    保持和加剧国际紧张局势的政策是帝国主义反动派的路线。帝国主义者奉行冷战政策，力求维持军备竞赛。这一点最具体地表现在杜勒斯要使世界始终濒于“战争边缘”这一主张上。帝国主义者想用这种方法为美国靠军备竞赛发财的垄断集团维持经济上的繁荣，想用这种方法增加劳动者的赋税重担。缓和国际紧张局势、裁军对他们是不利的。不实行军备竞赛就会迫使垄断组织改组生产，从军事生产转到民用品的生产。这样改组生产对人民是有利的，但是垄断资本家却害怕改组，因为这样会使垄断组织从军事订货所得的利润大为减少。
    他们惧怕经济恶化、民用品销售日益困难。垄断资本家也害怕缓和紧张局势和放弃军备竞赛会使他们无法威胁劳动人民，无法用“共产主义的危险”来恐吓人民并在这个借口下迫害争取和平的进步力量。帝国主义者为了巩固垄断资本的专政，采取冷战、军备竞赛和加剧国际紧张局势的政策。帝国主义者力图使工人相信，军事景气可以保证人民的充分就业，并且据说这是有利于工人的。但是先进的工人们清楚地知道，军事景气是不会持久的，他们知道，军备竞赛不会给自己带来什么好处。
    另外一个前途，就是发展民用生产部门。各国之间有着巨大的可能进行互利的贸易。苏联以及其他社会主义国家曾一再表示准备最广泛地发展贸易关系。无疑地，这将为发展各国间的贸易关系和经济关系打下坚固的基础。这完全符合我们执行的各个不同社会制度国家可以和平共处的路线。
    以缓和国际紧张局势和加强各国间友谊为目的的和平政策是各社会主义国家的旗帜。这一政策符合劳动人民的根本利益，符合发展和加强新社会经济结构的利益，符合巩固世界和平的利益。
    实际生活证明：发展国际关系的唯一正确的途径是和平共处的政策，是巩固和平和各国人民之间的友谊的政策。
    当然，我们主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处的政策，并不是要确认，社会主义和资本主义之间没有矛盾，它们之间可以建立充分的“和谐”，共产主义思想体系和资本主义思想体系可以调和。谁要采取这种观点，谁就离开马克思列宁主义。意识形态上的分歧是不可调和的，它们将存在下去，但这并不排斥社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间的和平共处与和平竞赛。
    在军事技术的目前发展条件下，帝国主义者要发动世界大战，必然要造成难以想像的巨大破坏和损失。使用原子武器、氢武器和弹道火箭必然要给全人类带来巨大的灾难。资本主义制度要是造成这种灾难，它就必然灭亡。各国人民决不会再容忍这种给人类带来痛苦、掀起血腥的侵略战争的制度。
    虽然我们深信，如果帝国主义集团发动新的战争，其结果必然是产生战争的制度、即资本主义制度遭到毁灭，社会主义制度取得胜利，但是，我们共产党人从来没有、而且将来也不打算采用这种可怕手段达到自己的目的，因为这是不道德的，是同我们共产主义世界观背道而驰的。我们认为，为了取得社会主义的胜利并不需要战争。
    世界社会主义体系拥有强大的经济、政治和军事力量。不管帝国主义者多么疯狂，他们也决不能摧毁世界社会主义体系日益壮大的力量，决不能阻止社会向共产主义迈进。
    同志们！我们亲眼看到了并且促进了国际共产主义运动和工人运动的思想和政治高潮。我们党的第二十次代表大会，特别是这次大会关于两个体系的和平共处、采取不同形式向社会主义过渡的可能性、现代防止战争的可能性、世界社会主义体系的发展等极其重要问题所作出的结论，在很大程度上促进了这个高潮的到来。苏共第二十次代表大会的思想，得到了各兄弟共产党和工人党的广泛的支持。中国、法国、意大利和其他许多国家的共产党所召开的代表大会，表明了共产党的团结一致，表明了它们忠于马克思列宁主义的原则，表明了它们在向伟大目标的奋斗过程中有坚定不移的决心和百折不挠的意志。
    国际共产主义运动和工人运动正在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，正在“全世界无产者，联合起来！”的战斗的光荣的口号下，向前发展。我们在回顾世界工人运动所走过的道路时，兴奋地指出：光荣的英国宪章派，1848年在法国、德国、匈牙利进行街垒战的无产阶级英雄们，第一国际的战士们，巴黎公社的不朽的英雄们，以及美国的工人们（根据他们的倡议，世界各国的劳动人民开始庆祝“五一”节——国际无产阶级团结的日子），是我们的先辈。
    1881年，马克思和恩格斯曾就彼得堡纪念“巴黎公社”十周年的群众大会写道：“巴黎公社由于‘秩序’的保卫者进行惨酷的屠杀而遭到失败的时候，胜利者们决没有料到，不到几十年，在遥远的彼得堡就会发生一个使‘俄国公社’必将建立起来的事件，虽然这要经过长期的惨酷的斗争。”（马克思恩格斯通讯选集1953年版第三四八页）斗争确是长期的和惨酷的。马克思主义的两位伟大导师的这个预言在三十五年之后终于实现了。又经过四十年的艰苦斗争，今天，在马克思列宁主义的光荣旗帜下，在久经战斗考验的共产党和工人党的领导下，千百万人民正满怀信心地向共产主义迈进。我们引以自豪的是：苏联工人阶级首先完成了社会主义革命。今天在共产主义道路上走在最前列的是我们的国家，是光荣的列宁主义的共产党领导下的伟大的苏联人民。
    同志们！伟大十月革命的四十年的总结表明，工人阶级在建成社会主义的斗争中，已经取得了许多具有世界历史意义的胜利。现在，社会主义各国的九亿五千多万人民正在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下建立新生活，正在竭力建设社会主义，促使共产主义胜利的早日到来。社会主义早已从理论问题变成实践问题，成为许多国家人民的生气勃勃的创造性的事业。
    今天有几万万人民在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下前进。明天还会有几千万和几万万劳动人民在这面胜利的旗帜下站立起来！
    苏联人民在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，向整个人类显示了自己在共产党领导下所获得的成就。谁也不能否认，苏联现在是一个强大的社会主义国家，是一个具有高度文化、科学和技术的国家。社会主义革命的最出色的成就，是空前地提高了人民的文化水平，培养出了新型的人——共产主义的积极建设者。社会主义社会的人的精神世界是丰富的，他们的理想和创造是伟大和大胆的！
    如果过去人们说过，莫斯科克里姆林宫尖塔上的红星闪耀着光辉，那么现在苏维埃人的创造性劳动建造了并且向宇宙发射出了新的星星——世界上首次出现的苏联人造卫星。这两颗人造卫星是苏联科学技术进步的标志，是苏联科学技术胜利的标志。人们公正地把它们称为和平的卫星。苏联人造卫星围绕着地球飞行的时候，就说明苏维埃国家的科学技术和整个经济有了高度的发展，说明这个国家的人民正在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下建设着新生活。
    苏维埃国家正在跨入它的第五个十年。我们的前途是光明和伟大的。
    我们虔诚地记着弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁嘱咐我们的一句话：纪念十月革命节的最好办法就是集中力量来解决还没有解决的任务。共产党和苏联人民瞻望着未来，注视着我们所面临的共产主义建设的巨大任务。党和人民正在解决这些任务，他们怀着坚定的信心，深信自己的创造力量，深信共产主义必将胜利。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年万岁！
    共产主义的建设者——伟大的苏联人民万岁！
    苏联人民同社会主义各国人民、同世界一切爱好和平的人民的友谊万岁！世界和平万岁！
    苏联共产党——我国人民在建设社会主义和共产主义斗争中一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者万岁！
    我们伟大的百战百胜的旗帜——马克思列宁主义万岁！
                    （新华社据塔斯社莫斯科11月6日电）
