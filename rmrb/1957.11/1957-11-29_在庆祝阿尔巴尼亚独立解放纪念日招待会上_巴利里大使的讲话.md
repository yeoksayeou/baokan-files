Comrades Zhu De and Zhou Enlai, dear comrades and friends:

    Allow me to express my deep gratitude to you for attending this reception held to celebrate two festivals of our nation, November 28th and 29th.

    The Albanian people, the smallest brother in our socialist family, today freely and independently celebrate the forty-fifth anniversary of their homeland's declaration of independence from centuries of Turkish rule. For centuries, our people have waged unremitting struggles for freedom and independence. The national hero Skanderbeg fought the powerful Turkish army for twenty-five years and repeatedly defeated them. But at that time, little Albania lacked supporters, so it ultimately failed. Despite this, the Albanian people continued to struggle for the next five hundred years. When the national liberation movements of the Balkan peoples surged, and at the same time, when some people were plotting new plans to place our people under the enslavement of our neighbors at the time, the patriot Ismail Qemali raised the national flag in Vlorë on November 28, 1912, and declared Albania's independence. This was a major event in the life of the Albanian people and a turning point in our history.

    After this, although Albania was trampled and destroyed by imperialist forces several times, our nation's consciousness was awakened and formed. At that time, a leading force was still lacking to maintain the true independence of the newly established Albanian state and embark on the road of economic and political progress. The feudal bourgeois group and their agent, Ahmet Zogu, consistently devoted themselves to foreign imperialists during his years in power, but despite the various means of terror or attack they adopted, they could not stop the Albanian people's strong will for freedom, independence, and democracy. Finally, they sold the country to Italian fascists.

    Thus, the Albanian people were again forced to take up arms and fight against Italian fascism and later Nazi Germany for a full five years. But now it was no longer isolated and helpless, nor was it without leadership as in the past. Now our people's national liberation struggle was inspired and guided by the great patriotic war of the Soviet people, and our people fought under the leadership of their own Communist Party. In this way, on November 29, 1944, the day after the thirty-first anniversary of national independence, the Albanian people celebrated their victory in gaining liberation from Nazi occupation. In this struggle, like all the people under the occupation of the aggressors, our people also suffered great losses, but this time it was a real victory, the first real victory in our history, from which we have the right to build a new democratic country, to build a better life for the working people, which is today being built victoriously with the assistance of our common great fraternal friend, the glorious Soviet Union, the great People's China, and other friendly countries. In the thirteen years of our people's peaceful life, under the leadership of the People's Labour Party and the democratic government, Albania has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country. Today, our industrial production has increased fourteenfold compared to pre-war levels, and in agriculture, a great socialist mechanized agriculture is also rapidly forming. Culture has greatly developed, and people's lives are improving day by day. Everything in Albania today is incomparable to the past.

    The People's Republic of China has given great help to our people's efforts to build a new life, both in the past and now. The Albanian people will always remember this support. The friendship between our two peoples is growing and developing day by day, and it will be greatly strengthened in the future. The great People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the visionary and creative Communist Party and Chairman Mao, is resolutely and rapidly advancing towards socialist construction. It is a major international force, and all conspiracies by imperialists to deny its rights are doomed to failure, just like all previous failures. Just like our friendship with the glorious Soviet people and other socialist countries and the people of all countries in the world, our people greatly value the friendship between us and the great Chinese people. The Albanian people have done and will continue to make every effort to further consolidate this friendship; similarly, we have done and will continue to make every effort to consolidate the great peaceful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and world peace.

    Finally, please raise this glass to the friendship between the great Chinese people and the Albanian people, to the progress and prosperity of the People's Republic of China, and to the good health and longevity of the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong!

### 在庆祝阿尔巴尼亚独立解放纪念日招待会上  巴利里大使的讲话

    在庆祝阿尔巴尼亚独立解放纪念日招待会上
    巴利里大使的讲话亲爱的朱德和周恩来同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    让我向你们表示深切的感谢，感谢你们出席这一次为庆祝我们民族的两个节日，11月28日和29日，而举行的招待会。
  阿尔巴尼亚人民，我们社会主义大家庭中最小的兄弟，今天自由、独立地庆祝自己祖国从土耳其几世纪的统治下宣布独立的四十五周年。几世纪来，我国人民曾经为了自由和独立而进行过不懈的斗争。民族英雄斯坎德培曾和强大的土耳其军队整整战斗了二十五年，并多次把他们击退了。但是当时小小的阿尔巴尼亚缺乏支持者，所以最后还是失败了。尽管这样，在以后的五百年内，阿尔巴尼亚人民还是一直坚持了斗争。当巴尔干各国人民民族解放运动高涨时，同时也正当有人在策划种种新计划企图把我国人民置于当时我们邻国的奴役下的时候，爱国者依斯马尔·基马尔，于1912年11月28日，在发罗拉高举国旗宣布了阿尔巴尼亚的独立。这是阿尔巴尼亚人民生活中一个重大的事件，同时也是我国历史上的一个转折点。
    此后，虽然帝国主义势力曾几次践踏和破坏阿尔巴尼亚，但我们民族的觉悟已清醒和形成了。当时要保持阿尔巴尼亚新建立的国家真正的独立，并走上经济和政治进步的道路，还缺乏一种领导力量。封建资产阶级集团和他们的代理人阿黑默德·索古，在他统治的几年里，一贯投身于外国帝国主义者，但是尽管他们采取了种种恐怖手段或进攻，都没有能阻止阿尔巴尼亚人民对自由、独立和民主的坚强意志。最后，他们把国家出卖给了意大利法西斯。
    这样，阿尔巴尼亚人民又被迫拿起了枪，在整整五年内和意大利法西斯以及后来的纳粹德国进行斗争。但是，现在它已经不再是孤立无援的，也不再像过去那样没有领导的了。现在我国人民的民族解放斗争受到了苏联人民伟大的爱国战争的鼓舞和指导，我国人民在自己的共产党领导下进行了斗争。这样，到1944年11月29日，民族独立三十一周年的第二天，阿尔巴尼亚人民庆祝了自己从纳粹占领下获得解放的胜利。在这次斗争中，像所有在侵略者占领下的人民一样，我国人民也受到了很大的损失，但是这一次真正的胜利了，它是我国历史上第一次真正的胜利，从此我们就有权利来建设一个新民主主义的国家，建设劳动人民的美好的生活，这就是今天在我们共同伟大的兄弟般的朋友光荣的苏联、伟大的人民中国以及其他各友好国家的援助下，胜利地建设着的社会主义。在我国人民和平生活的十三年内，在人民的劳动党和民主政府的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚已经从一个落后的农业国变成了一个农业—工业国。今天，我国的工业生产比战前增加到十四倍，农业方面，也迅速地形成了一个伟大的社会主义机械化的农业。文化有了很大的发展，人民生活日益在提高，阿尔巴尼亚今天的一切都无法和过去相比了。
    中华人民共和国在我国人民为建设新生活而作的努力中，无论是过去或现在，都给了很大的帮助。对于这种支援，阿尔巴尼亚人民会永远记住的。我们两国人民的友谊日益在增长和发展，将来它还将大大地巩固。伟大的中华人民共和国，在具有远见和创造性的共产党以及毛主席的领导下，为了社会主义的建设，而坚决地、大踏步的前进着。它是一个重大的国际力量，帝国主义者企图否认其权利的一切阴谋，像以往历次的失败一样，也是注定要以失败而告终的。就像我们和光荣的苏联人民和其他社会主义国家以及世界各国人民的友谊一样，我国人民非常重视我们和伟大的中国人民之间的友谊。阿尔巴尼亚人民在过去曾作过，今后也还将继续作一切努力，以进一步巩固这一友谊；同样，过去我们曾作过，而今后也将继续作一切努力，来巩固以苏联为首的伟大的和平社会主义阵营以及世界的和平。
    最后，请各位举这一杯，为伟大的中国人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民之间的友谊，为中华人民共和国的进步和繁荣，为敬爱的毛泽东主席的身体健康和万寿无疆，而干杯！
