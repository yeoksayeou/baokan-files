Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto issued by the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of All Countries have been warmly welcomed by the working people of all countries and valued by newspapers and periodicals of various countries.

After enthusiastically reading these two documents, many workers, staff, collective farm members, and university students in the Soviet Union unanimously believed that these documents are conducive to the further unity of the forces of peace and to the struggle for peace and to strengthen the friendship of the people of all countries. Glazov, a worker at the Likhachev Automobile Factory in Moscow, said that representatives of the working people of almost all countries signed the Peace Manifesto, which proves that people with good wishes hope for peace and pursue progress and a bright future. The working people of Sverdlovsk, the Soviet Union's huge industrial center, read these two historical documents with particular satisfaction. The workers unanimously stated that they would use their labor to consolidate the socialist camp and would use all their strength to fight to prevent the threat of war.

The "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnam Labor Party, published an editorial pointing out that this declaration has the nature of a common program of the socialist countries of the present era, and is a guide for the actions of the socialist countries and other communist and workers' parties in the world. Its particularly important significance is that it is the ideological foundation for the unity of the brother parties of all countries in the cause of fighting common enemies.

North Korea's "Nodong Sinmun" published an editorial saying that the Peace Manifesto calls on progressive humanity to devote themselves to the struggle to safeguard and consolidate peace, which makes people believe that war can be prevented and peace can be maintained. Socialism is peace.

Mongolia's "Unen" pointed out that the entire people of the powerful socialist camp are united under the lofty goal of building socialism and communism and safeguarding world peace. Socialist ideas have penetrated the hearts of hundreds of millions of people and have become an invincible force. All sectors of the Mongolian people expressed their enthusiastic support after reading the two declarations.

Many well-known social activists, veteran fighters of the German workers' movement, and socialist advanced producers in the German Democratic Republic have made speeches on this and called on the working people of the world to rise up against the threat of a new war. The famous writer Arnold Zweig said that this statement is like a breath of fresh air that refreshes the international atmosphere and makes people breathe easier. The female writer Anna-Charlotte Zehtgast said: The Peace Manifesto of the Marxist workers' parties not only expresses the peaceful will of the Communists of sixty-four countries, but also expresses the peaceful will of the people of the world.

Albania's "Zëri i Popullit" said in an editorial: The meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries shows that the socialist camp determines the fate of the world today. It shows the unbreakable unity of the socialist countries and their confidence in being united forever under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and moving towards communism.

Ville Pessi, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Finland, pointed out in "People's News" that the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries showed that they held completely consistent views on all the international issues discussed.

The "Akahata," the organ of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, published the full text of the declaration under the title "Further Strengthening the Unity of the Socialist Family." This newspaper also wrote that this document is a great contribution to the cause of the communist movement under new international conditions. "Asahi Shimbun" emphasized that the declaration emphasized the socialist countries' unwavering foreign policy based on the principle of peaceful coexistence. This is an important point of the declaration.

All Egyptian newspapers published detailed summaries of the Declaration of the Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries on the front page. "Al Shaab" used a banner headline: "The forces of peace are growing and strengthening, and war can now be avoided. 950 million people have chosen socialism and are building their new lives." "Al-Gomhuria" pointed out in a dispatch entitled "Peace forces can prevent war": "Now, the forces of peace are strong enough to prevent the threat of war, and the failure of the imperialist conspiracy against Egypt is an example."

All Paris newspapers published news about these documents and detailed summaries of the declaration in prominent positions. Many newspapers believe that these two declarations are new evidence of the strengthening of the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, and contrast this situation with the serious crisis within the North Atlantic Group. The right-wing press tried its best to belittle the significance of the declaration, insisting that there seemed to be "nothing new" in the declaration.

Italy's "l'Unità" commented that the meeting held by representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries was of historical significance. "La Nazione" believes that the publication of this declaration is out of a desire to safeguard world peace. (Attached pictures)

    两个重要文件深入各国人民心坎
    举世欢呼社会主义阵营团结和平力量强大
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言以及各国共产党和工人党代表会议发出的和平宣言受到了各国劳动人民热烈的欢迎和各国报刊的重视。
    苏联许多工人、职员、集体农庄庄员和大学生们热情地阅读了这两个文件以后，一致认为，这些文件有助于和平力量的更加团结，有助于争取和平、争取加强各国人民的友谊的斗争。莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂的工人格拉佐夫说，几乎所有国家的劳动人民代表都在和平宣言上签了字，这证明：具有善良愿望的人们是希望和平、追求进步和光明的未来的。苏联巨大的工业中心——斯维德洛夫斯克的劳动人民特别满意地读了这两个历史文件。工人们一致表示，要用自己的劳动来巩固社会主义阵营，要用一切力量为防止战争的威胁而进行斗争。
    越南劳动党机关报“人民报”发表社论指出，这个宣言具有当代社会主义各国党的共同纲领的性质，是社会主义各国和全世界其他各国共产党和工人党行动的指南。它的特别重要的意义在于，它是各国兄弟党在跟共同敌人斗争事业中团结一致的思想基础。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论说，和平宣言号召进步人类投入维护和巩固和平的斗争，使人们确信，战争是可以防止的，和平是可以维护住的。社会主义就是和平。
    蒙古“真理报”指出，强大的社会主义阵营的全体人民是在建设社会主义、共产主义和维护世界和平的崇高目的下团结起来的。社会主义思想已经深入到亿万人民的心中，并且成为不可战胜的力量。蒙古各阶层人民在读了两个宣言后都表示热烈拥护。
    德意志民主共和国许多著名社会活动家、德国工人运动老战士和社会主义先进生产者都为此发表了谈话，呼吁全世界劳动人民起来反对新战争威胁。名作家阿诺德·茨威格说，这个声明像一股新鲜的空气使国际气氛为之一新，人们的呼吸也轻松了。女作家安娜—沙尔洛塔·泽特加斯特说：马克思主义的工人政党的和平宣言不仅表达了六十四个国家共产党人的和平意志，同时也表达了全世界人民的和平意志。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”在社论中说：社会主义国家共产党和工人党的代表会议表明，社会主义阵营决定着今天世界的命运。它显示了社会主义国家牢不可破的团结和他们在马克思列宁主义旗帜下永远团结在一起走向共产主义的信心。
    芬兰共产党总书记维勒·培西在“人民新闻”上指出，社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议表明，它们对所讨论过的一切国际问题抱有完全一致的观点。
    日本共产党中央委员会机关报“赤旗报”以“社会主义大家庭各国团结的进一步加强”为题，全文登载了这篇宣言。这家报纸并且写道，这一文件对新的国际条件下的共产主义运动事业是一个巨大贡献。“朝日新闻”强调指出，宣言中强调了社会主义国家不可动摇地依据和平共处原则的外交政策。这是宣言的重要的一点。
    埃及各报都在第一版刊登了社会主义国家共产党和工人党会议宣言的详细摘要。“人民报”用通栏大字标题写道：“和平力量正在壮大和加强，现在已经可以避免战争了。九亿五千万人民选择了社会主义，并且正在建设他们的新生活。”“共和国报”在以“和平力量可以防止战争”为题的通讯中指出：“现在，和平力量已经强大到足以防止战争威胁的程度，帝国主义反对埃及阴谋的失败就是一个例子。”
    巴黎所有报纸都在显著地位发表了有关这些文件的消息和宣言的详细摘要。许多报纸认为这两个宣言是各国共产党和工人党加强团结的新的证明，并且把这种情况同北大西洋集团内部的严重危机相对比。右翼报刊竭力企图贬低宣言的意义，硬说宣言中似乎没有“任何新东西”。
    意大利“团结报”在评论中指出，各国共产党和工人党代表所举行的会议具有历史意义。“国家报”认为这个宣言的发表是出于维护世界和平的意愿。（附图片）
