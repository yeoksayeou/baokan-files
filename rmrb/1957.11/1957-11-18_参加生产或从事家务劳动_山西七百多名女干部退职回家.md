Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 17th: More than 700 female cadres in Shanxi Province have already resigned from their positions to return home to participate in production or housework. The Provincial People's Committee recently convened a forum with twelve former female cadres from agencies residing in Taiyuan City who have returned home to engage in housework, to understand their ideological and living conditions after returning home.

Deng Tonglan, who originally worked in the Engineering Team of the Shanxi Provincial Public Security Bureau, joined the revolution in 1947 and has been a Party member for nearly ten years. She applied for resignation because she felt that her cultural level was low, she had difficulties with her work, and she was burdened with children and needed someone to take care of the housework. She said at the forum that she is now concentrating on handling housework and is happier than before.

Another female cadre, Yuan Yuhua, suffered from tuberculosis. In the past, while working, she also had to help the nanny take care of six children, taking leave for a third of the month. The family's expenses were very high, and income could not cover expenses, so she had to apply for relief every month. After she resigned to participate in housework, her health has improved in the past six months, and her husband is no longer troubled by the poor arrangement of family life. After expenses, they can save fifteen yuan each month.

The resigned female cadres also mentioned at the forum that because they directly manage housework, they not only save expenses, but also take good care of their children, reducing the burden on their husbands. Some people have also played a role in street work after returning home.

Wei Fengqi, Secretary-General of the Provincial People's Committee, encouraged them in the forum to use the spirit of diligence and frugality to manage their housework well and to educate their children to become successors of communism.

    参加生产或从事家务劳动
    山西七百多名女干部退职回家
    新华社太原17日电　山西省已经有七百多名妇女干部退职回家参加生产或家务劳动。省人民委员会最近召集回家从事家务劳动的住在太原市的十二名原机关妇女干部座谈，了解她们回家后的思想情况和生活情况。
    原来在山西省公安厅工程队工作的邓通兰，在1947年参加革命，党龄将近十年。她因为感到自己文化水平较低，工作有困难，同时因为有孩子拖累，家务又需要人照管，因此申请退职。她在座谈会上说，现在她集中精力处理家务，过得比以前更愉快了。
    另一个妇女干部原玉花患有结核病，过去她一面工作，一面还要帮助保姆照顾六个孩子，每个月总有三分之一的时间请假。全家开支很大，入不敷出，不得不每月都申请救济。她退职参加家务劳动后，半年来身体比以前好些了，她爱人不再由于家庭生活安排不好而烦恼，收入每月除开支外还能节余十五元。
    退职的妇女干部们在座谈会上还谈到，由于她们直接料理家务，不仅节省开支，而且照管好了孩子，减少了丈夫的负担，有的人回去后还在街道工作中发挥了作用。
    省人民委员会秘书长卫逢祺在座谈中勉励她们用勤俭持家的精神来管理好家务，把孩子教育成为共产主义的接班人。
