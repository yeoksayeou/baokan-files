    How Strong is the Soviet Minsk "Spartak" Football Team?
    The Soviet Belarusian Minsk "Spartak" football team arrived in Beijing on the 21st. The team consists of twenty people, and the leader is G. Tokuyev, Chairman of the Minsk "Spartak" Sports Association. They will hold two exciting matches in Beijing on the 24th and 27th.
    The Minsk "Spartak" football team is the fourth Soviet Premier League football team to visit our country, following the Leningrad "Zenit" team, the Moscow "Lokomotiv" team, and the Tbilisi "Dinamo" team.
    The Minsk "Spartak" team has a relatively long history. In recent years, due to the team's significant lineup changes and the constant replacement of veterans with newcomers, their performance and ranking in the All-Union Football League have also frequently changed:
    1954: Third place in Group A 1955: Twelfth place in Group A (relegated to Group B)
    1956: Champion of Group B (promoted to Group A) 1957: Twelfth place in Group A
    In international matches, the Minsk "Spartak" team has defeated the Swiss "Lausanne" team 2-0 and the Swedish "史得瑞" team 4-0. When our football team visited Minsk last year, some of the team members represented the Belarusian team and drew 1-1 with our football team. Before coming to our country this time, the Minsk "Spartak" team visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for friendly matches, resulting in a 3-2 victory over the Ministry of Interior team, a 3-0 victory over the People's Army, a 1-1 draw with the Pyongyang team, and a 1-2 loss to the People's Army.
    The Minsk "Spartak" team plays with a cohesive offense and defense, with good teamwork. They possess both delicate and skilled footwork, as well as sharp sprints and courageous tackles. It appears to have a bit of a "strength within softness, and softness within strength" feel. This style of play requires players to have great flexibility and skill, and they have been quite successful in achieving this, because whether they are sprinting and breaking through, or dribbling and advancing, they can meet the needs of the current battle situation.

### 苏联明斯克“斯巴达克”足球队实力如何？

    苏联明斯克“斯巴达克”足球队实力如何？
    苏联白俄罗斯明斯克“斯巴达克”足球队已经在21日到达北京。该队由二十人组成，领队是明斯克“斯巴达克”体育协会主席格·托库耶夫。他们在24和27两日，将在北京举行两场精采的比赛。
    明斯克“斯巴达克”足球队，是继列宁格勒“泽尼特”队、莫斯科“火车头”队、梯比利斯“狄纳莫”队之后，第四个来我国访问的苏联甲级足球队。
    明斯克“斯巴达克”队，有相当长的历史。最近几年来，由于该队阵容变化较大，不断以新手来替换老将，因此在全苏足球联赛中的战绩和名次也经常变化：
    1954年　甲组第三名      1955年　甲组第十二名（降入乙组）
    1956年　乙组冠军（升入甲组）　1957年　甲组第十二名
    明斯克“斯巴达克”队在国际比赛中，曾经以二比○胜瑞士的“洛桑”队，四比○胜瑞典“史得瑞”队。去年我国足球队访问明斯克时，该队部分队员代表白俄罗斯队与我国足球队战成一比一和局。这次，在来我国之前，明斯克“斯巴达克”队，曾去朝鲜民主主义人民共和国作访问比赛，结果以三比二胜内务省队、三比○胜人民军队、一比一和平壤队，一比二负于人民军队。
    明斯克“斯巴达克”队踢来是攻守一气呵成，默契不错，他们既有细腻和娴熟的脚法，也有锐利的冲刺和勇猛的抢夺，看起来，颇有点“刚中带柔、柔里带刚”的感觉。这种踢法，需要球员有很大的伸缩性与技巧，而他们却是相当成功地做到了这一点，因为他们无论冲刺突入、或是盘带推进，都能符合当时所处战况的需要。
