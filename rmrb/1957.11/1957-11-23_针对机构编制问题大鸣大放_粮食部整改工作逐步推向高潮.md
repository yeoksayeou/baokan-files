Aiming at Institutional and Staffing Problems, Extensive Criticism and Suggestions
The Grain Ministry's Rectification Work Gradually Rises to a Climax

(Our dispatch) After achieving a decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, the Ministry of Grain quickly transitioned to the third stage of the rectification campaign.

In order to guide the healthy and vigorous development of the movement, the leadership of the Ministry of Grain made a series of preparations in advance. On November 8th, Vice Minister and Party Group Secretary Chen Guodong gave a mobilization report on rectification and improvement to all cadres. Immediately afterward, each department and bureau gave mobilization and enlightenment speeches in light of their own specific circumstances. With the active encouragement of the leadership and the leading role of Party and Communist Youth League members in speaking out freely, the enthusiasm of the masses generally soared, thereby gradually pushing the movement to a climax. As of November 19th, a total of 1,771 big-character posters had been put up, raising 5,505 suggestions.

The main focus of the big-character posters was on the institutions and staffing. Comrades sharply exposed the phenomena of the Ministry of Grain's large organization and overstaffing. Taking clerical staff as an example, the ministry has more than 120 people, accounting for 12% of the total number of staff in the organization. According to the actual workload, the number of staff in printing, clerical work, and archives alone could be reduced from the current 65 to 32, and the number of receiving and dispatching staff in each department and bureau could also be reduced by half. In addition, other business units generally have the problem of having too many people and too little work. The masses demand that the leadership be determined to vigorously streamline the organization.

The big-character posters also made a lot of criticisms of the office life, business work, and leadership style.

The leadership of the Ministry of Grain attaches great importance to the opinions of the masses. The ministers personally went to carefully view the big-character posters in each department and bureau. In order to strengthen the leadership of the rectification and improvement work, under the leadership of the Party Group and the Ministry's Rectification Leadership Group, four special task forces were established according to the nature of the problems to earnestly study and deal with the opinions raised by the masses. Each group is personally led by a Party member vice minister. A preliminary plan for streamlining the organization has been discussed and is planned to be submitted to the masses for discussion in the next few days. Regarding the issue of reports, each type of report has been repeatedly studied and discussed, and it has been preliminarily determined to reduce the existing various reports by half. Other major issues in business are also under study.

The departments and bureaus have also made many improvements regarding the issues that can be resolved by the departments and bureaus themselves. According to incomplete statistics, the six departments and bureaus of oil, grain prices, and personnel alone have put forward 96 improvement suggestions.

    针对机构编制问题大鸣大放
    粮食部整改工作逐步推向高潮
    本报讯　在反右派斗争已取得决定性的胜利以后，粮食部迅速转入了整风第三阶段。
    为了引导运动健康蓬勃的发展，粮食部领导上事先做了一系列的工作。11月8日，副部长、党组书记陈国栋向全体干部作了整改动员报告，紧接着各司局又分别结合本单位的情况作了动员启发。在领导积极鼓动，党团员带头鸣放的情况下，群众情绪普遍高涨，从而把运动逐步推向高潮。截至11月19日为止，共贴出大字报一千七百七十一张，提出了意见五千五百零五条。
    大字报的锋芒主要针对着机构编制，同志们尖锐地揭发了粮食部机构庞大、人浮于事的现象。以文书处理人员来说，该部就有一百二十多人，占机关总人数的12％。若按实际工作量来说，仅文印、文书及档案人员就可以由现有的六十五人减少为三十二人，各司局的收发人员也可以减少一半。另外，其他各业务单位也较普遍的存在着人多事少的情况，群众要求领导上下决心大力紧缩机构。
    大字报上对机关生活、业务工作及领导作风，也提出了不少批评。
    粮食部领导上对群众的意见极为重视。每个司局的大字报，部长们都亲自前去仔细观看。为了加强对整改工作的领导，在党组和部整风领导小组的领导下，按问题性质设立了四个专案小组，认真地研究处理群众提出的意见，每个小组都由党员副部长亲自领导。紧缩机构已初步讨论出一个方案，准备在最近几天内提交群众讨论。关于报表的问题，对每一种报表都反复地进行了研究与讨论，初步确定把现有各种报表减少一半。业务上的其他重大问题，也正在研究中。
    司、局能解决的问题，各司、局也作了很多改进。据不完全统计，仅油脂、粮价、人事等六个司、局已提出了改进意见九十六条。
