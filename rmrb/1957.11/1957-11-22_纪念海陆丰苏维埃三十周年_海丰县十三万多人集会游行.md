    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 21st: Over 30,000 people from all walks of life in Haifeng County, Guangdong Province, gathered at Red Square in Haifeng City today to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Hailufeng Soviet. In addition, ten other regions throughout the county held rallies to commemorate this anniversary, bringing the total number of participants to over 130,000.
    Early in the morning, farmers, workers, cadres, and students from the surrounding villages and towns flooded into Red Square, the center of revolutionary activities during the Great Revolution. The square was filled with red flags and the sound of gongs and drums, creating an unprecedentedly grand scene. At approximately 9:00 a.m., a silver aircraft flew over Haifeng City, scattering leaflets, and the cheers and applause from the streets and the venue resounded through the sky.
    At 10:40 a.m., Jiang Suizhi, Secretary of the Haifeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, announced the opening of the assembly. After the band played "The Internationale" and the national anthem, the presentation of banners to the assembly commenced. Mr. Orlov, the Soviet Consul in Guangzhou, who arrived from Guangzhou last night, presented a banner to the assembly on behalf of the Soviet Consulate in Guangzhou. Subsequently, Gu Dacun, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, presented a banner on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee.
    Gu Dacun addressed the gathering after presenting the banner. On behalf of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, he paid tribute to the martyrs who had sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary struggle over the past thirty years and extended his regards to the people of Hailufeng and the people of the old revolutionary base areas in eastern Guangdong who had worked hard for the revolutionary cause for a long time. He encouraged everyone to continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work in the past, unite as one, consolidate agricultural cooperatives, develop production, and strive to realize the National Program for Agricultural Development.
    Soviet Consul in Guangzhou, Orlov, then spoke. He represented the Soviet people in congratulating the people of Hailufeng and their leaders. He said that the Hailufeng Uprising thirty years ago and its initial victory were met with sincere sympathy from the Soviet people.
    Mother Peng Pai also spoke at the meeting. She called on everyone to do a good job in all areas of work, especially in running agricultural cooperatives well. She said that although we still have difficulties now, it is much better than it was thirty years ago. As long as we rely closely on the leadership of the Communist Party, all difficulties can be overcome.
    After the assembly, the parade began. In the mighty procession, there were Red Guards, Spear Squads, Dagger Squads, Red Women's Teams, and Children's Corps, all played by farmers, workers, and students. An old man named Chen Bo, who had participated in the Soviet regime in 1927, said that thirty years ago today, when celebrating the establishment of the Soviet here, people were as crowded and enthusiastic as this, but at that time, what awaited us was a more cruel struggle; but today our ideals have been realized, and everyone is happily attending the celebration meeting, and a better life awaits us ahead.

    纪念海陆丰苏维埃三十周年
    海丰县十三万多人集会游行
    新华社广州21日电　广东省海丰县各界三万多人今天在海丰城内的红场集会，纪念海陆丰苏维埃三十周年。全县今天还有九个地区共十万多人同时集会纪念这个节日。
    一清早，四乡的农民、工人、干部和学生，像潮水一样地涌到大革命时代革命活动的中心红场。红场内红旗遮日，锣鼓喧天，盛况空前。九时许，一架银色飞机飞临海丰城上空散发传单，这时，街道上、会场上发出的欢呼声和掌声响彻云霄。
    十时四十分，中共海丰县委书记姜绥之宣布大会开始。乐队奏国际歌和国歌后，开始向大会献旗。昨天晚上从广州赶来的苏联驻广州领事鄂洛夫，代表苏联驻广州领事馆向大会献旗。接着，中共广东省委书记古大存代表中共广东省委和广东省人民委员会献旗。
    古大存在献旗后向大家讲话。他代表中共广东省委和广东省人民委员会向三十多年来在革命斗争中牺牲了的烈士致敬，向为革命事业长期艰苦奋斗的海陆丰人民和粤东老根据地的人民致以慰问。他勉励大家继续发扬过去艰苦奋斗的精神，大家团结一致，巩固农业社，发展生产，为实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗。
    苏联驻广州领事鄂洛夫接着讲话。他代表苏联人民，向海陆丰人民和他们的领导者祝贺。他说，三十年前海陆丰暴动和它最初取得的胜利，就得到苏联人民衷心的同情。
    彭湃烈士的母亲也在会上讲话。她号召大家做好各项工作，尤其要办好农业社。她说，虽然我们现在还有困难，可是比三十年前好得多了，只要我们紧紧地依靠共产党的领导，一切困难都能克服。
    大会结束后，开始游行。在浩浩荡荡的游行队伍中，有由农民、工人、学生扮演的赤卫队、尖串队、尖刀队、红色妇女队和童子团。一个曾经参加过1927年苏维埃政权的老人陈波说，三十年前的今天，在这里庆祝苏维埃成立的时候，人们也像这样的拥挤、热烈，可是那个时候等待着我们的是更残酷的斗争；而今天我们的理想实现了，大家高高兴兴来开庆祝大会，前面等待着我们的是更美好的生活。
