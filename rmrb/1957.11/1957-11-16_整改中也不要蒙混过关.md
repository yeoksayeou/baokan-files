Don't Muddle Through During Rectification Either
　　Guo Min
　　Taking rectification as the key and continuing to air views simultaneously is an important stage in the rectification campaign. In this stage, many units have indeed made some serious improvements. Recently, countless examples of rectifying while airing views have been heard and seen. For example, in a factory in Beijing, water for testing used to be taken near the boiler, with temperatures as high as 400 to 500 degrees Celsius. Many workers had their backs scalded by the high temperature. Workers had raised many suggestions, but the problem was not solved for more than half a year. This time, the workers raised the issue again during the rectification campaign, and the deputy secretary of the Party Branch organized everyone to find a solution. As a result, a pipe was connected from the boiler to the testing area. The problem was solved in half a day.

　　A problem that had been accumulating for half a year, and the solution was very simple. This proves that as long as the leadership values the opinions of the masses and can mobilize everyone to find solutions, the wisdom and strength of the masses will be revealed, and no matter how big the problem is, it is not difficult to solve. This is the mainstream of the rectification campaign. Naturally, there are also some problems that should be solved but cannot be done temporarily. In this case, we must actively create conditions to prepare for improvement. For unreasonable opinions, we must also patiently explain and persuade.

　　However, there are also a few leading cadres who are afraid of making changes. In order to oppose the Rightists, these people deny the shortcomings and errors that do exist in our work, and even portray themselves as perfect saints. They did not realize that opposing the Rightists does not in itself eliminate our shortcomings and errors. To correct errors and shortcomings, leading comrades must be determined to work with the masses to make changes. We cannot just rely on others without taking action ourselves. Airing views without making changes will not solve any problems.

　　But there are also some units that do not seriously study and deal with the opinions of the masses, but instead adopt a formalistic approach. In some factories, the answers to questions are very perfunctory during the process of rectifying while airing views, and the leadership has not proposed specific solutions to the problems. For example, when workers raised the issue of unmanaged materials, the solution announced by the factory was: strengthen management. When workers raised the issue that someone's work style was not good, the solution was: strengthen education. When workers raised the issue that the clinic gave too much medicine, causing waste, the solution was: let the clinic pay attention. The responses of some factories to the opinions raised by the masses are almost applicable to everything, such as: "The opinions raised are very good, we will definitely consider them when necessary and possible!" "We have seen the opinions, we have noticed them, and we will definitely resolutely change them in the future." Such responses are perfunctory, irresponsible, and hasty. Obviously, this is not a serious rectification, but a bureaucratic and formalistic rectification.

　　Being afraid of making changes and carrying out rectification in a formalistic and bureaucratic way are important ideological problems in the current third stage of the rectification campaign. This must be resolutely opposed. Leading cadres must not mistakenly believe that the rectification campaign is almost over after the great airing of views and the opposition to the Rightists, nor should they think that it is enough to just say "Opinions received," "Noted," "Will definitely consider." This will not work. Rectification is definitely not something that can be muddled through in this way.

### 整改中也不要蒙混过关

    整改中也不要蒙混过关
    郭敏
    以整改为重点同时继续鸣放这是整风中的一个重要阶段，在这个阶段的确有不少单位认真地改了一些，最近耳闻目睹边整边改的事例已经数不胜数。例如北京某工厂平时化验水要靠近锅炉取水，温度高达摄氏四百度到五百度，不少工人曾因温度高烫肿了脊背，工人提过不少意见，半年多没解决，这次工人在整风中又提了意见，党总支副书记就组织大家想办法，结果从锅炉接一根管子出来，到化验的地方，结果，半天工夫，问题就解决了。
    积压了半年的问题，解决的办法也甚为简单。这就证明只要领导上重视群众的意见，并能发动大家想办法，群众的智慧和力量就会显露出来，天大的问题也不难解决。这是整风中的主流。自然也有一些问题应该解决，而暂时还办不到，这就要积极创造条件准备改进，对于不合理的意见，也须耐心地解释和说服。
    但是，也有少数领导干部怕改。这些人为了反右派，就否认了我们工作中确实存在的缺点和错误，甚至把自己说成是完美无缺的圣人。他们没有认识到，反右派这事的本身并不能消除我们的缺点和错误。改正错误和缺点，还是要领导同志下决心同群众一道去改。不能自己不动，光依靠别人。光鸣放而不改是不能解决任何问题的。
    但还有些单位，对群众的意见并不认真的研究和处理，而是采取了一种形式主义的处理办法。有些工厂在边整边改中，解答问题十分草率，领导上也没有提出解决问题的具体办法。如有的厂工人提出材料无人管理，厂方公布的解决办法是：加强管理。工人提出某人作风不好，解决的办法是：加强教育。工人提出医务室给的药过多，造成浪费，解决的办法是：让医务室注意。有些工厂对群众提出的意见的答复，几乎是对任何事都适用的，例如：“所提意见很好，在必要和可能的时候一定考虑！”“意见看到了，我们已注意到了，以后一定坚决的改。”如此答复，敷衍塞责，草草了事。显然这不是认真地进行整改，而是一种官僚主义、形式主义的整改。
    怕改和形式主义、官僚主义地整改，这是目前整风第三阶段中的重要的思想问题。这是必须坚决反对的。领导干部不能错误地认为经过大鸣大放和反右派，整风就差不多了，也不能认为只说说“意见收到了”，“注意了”，“一定考虑”就算完事大吉。这样是不行的。整改决不是这样可以蒙混过去的。
