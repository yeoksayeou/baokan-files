A Beneficial Suggestion from the Blooming and Contending Period: Grain Production Can Increase by 3 to 5 Billion Jin

During the Great Blooming and Contending, the Ministry of Agriculture put forward many extremely beneficial suggestions for developing agricultural production. Among them, the suggestion to promote hybrid corn varieties, once implemented, could increase the nation's grain production by at least 3 to 5 billion jin annually.

The suggestion to promote hybrid corn varieties was put forward in a big-character poster by Mark Rang, Zeng Guanhui, Wang Yaolun, and Li Meisen, staff members of the Seed Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture. In their big-character poster, they stated: Promoting hybrid corn is the most effective measure to increase corn yields. According to current experience in our country, hybrid corn generally yields 20% to 30% more than ordinary corn, and in some cases, it can yield 60% or even more.

Currently, China's corn planting area is over 220 million mu, with an average yield of over 180 jin per mu. If 100 million mu were planted with hybrid varieties, with an average increase of 30 to 50 jin per mu, annual grain production could increase by 3 to 5 billion jin.

In the past two years, agricultural scientific research institutions and agricultural universities in our country have made significant contributions to the research and cultivation of hybrid corn. To date, 63 relatively good inter-varietal hybrids have been selected nationwide, of which 17 hybrids have already begun to be promoted. Regions with different farming systems such as North China, Northeast China, and South China, all have hybrid combinations suitable for local conditions, and the yield increase effects are very significant. For example, the “Fangza No. 2” and “Qiyu No. 24” inter-varietal hybrid corn varieties promoted in Shandong Province generally increase yields by 30% to 50%, and in some cases, more than double.

However, to date, the planting area of hybrid corn varieties nationwide is only about one million mu. Why hasn't the promotion of hybrid corn varieties been fully rolled out? Why has the development of the planting area been so slow? Mark Rang and others believe that this is mainly because agricultural leadership departments have not given enough attention to this work. They suggest that agricultural leadership departments must quickly establish specialized parent seed breeding farms in areas where corn combinations already exist and have achieved results, vigorously propagate parent seeds to become a base for supplying parent seeds to agricultural cooperatives; and instruct agricultural colleges and agricultural research institutions in key corn-producing areas to strengthen corn hybrid breeding work, and continue to select more and better hybrid combinations as well as hybrids between inbred lines; at the same time, systematically discuss and formulate long-term plans for the development of hybrid corn varieties, and strengthen the training of agricultural technicians in various provinces, increase visits and internships, in order to more widely utilize the scientific research results that have been achieved in production.

After this suggestion was put forward, it immediately attracted the attention of many people. Ma Juweng, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Ministry of Agriculture, and others, after seeing this suggestion, quickly wrote a big-character poster expressing their agreement and support for their proposed promotion of hybrid corn varieties. They also requested that relevant departments earnestly strengthen the management of hybrid corn varieties, promote the already selected hybrid corn varieties, and at the same time strengthen the technical instruction of hybrid corn varieties, and vigorously organize agricultural cooperatives to prepare hybrid seeds themselves.

The rectification leadership group of the Ministry of Agriculture believes that this suggestion has great significance for increasing the unit yield of corn and increasing production, and has initially determined that it will be promoted in a planned and step-by-step manner in the future. Currently, the Seed Bureau has organized a special team to conduct preliminary research, preparing to conduct multi-point trials and demonstrations nationwide next year, and organize the establishment of parent breeding bases to create conditions for the large-scale promotion of hybrid corn varieties in 1959.

    鸣放中一项有益建议  可增产粮三、五十亿斤
    农业部在大鸣大放中提出了许多对发展农业生产极为有益的建议。其中要求推广玉米杂交种的一项建议在实现以后，每年至少能给国家增产三十亿到五十亿斤粮食。
    推广玉米杂交种的这项建议，是农业部种子局的工作人员马克让、曾观惠、汪耀伦李梅森等四人在大字报上提出的。他们在大字报上说：推广玉米杂交种是提高玉米产量最有效的措施，根据目前我国的经验，杂交种的玉米一般能比普通玉米增产20％到30％，有的还可以增产60％甚至更多。
    我国目前现有玉米种植面积为两亿二千多万亩，平均每亩产量约为一百八十多斤，如果其中一亿亩种上杂交种，每亩平均以增产三十斤到五十斤计算，每年就可以增产三十亿到五十亿斤粮食。
    我国农业科学研究机关和农业大学，近两年来在研究玉米杂交种的培育工作上，作出了不少贡献。到目前为止，全国各地已选育出六十三个比较好的品种间杂交种，其中有十七个杂交种已经开始推广。华北、东北、华南等不同耕作制度的地区，都有适合当地条件的杂交组合，并且增产的效果都很显著。例如，在山东省推广的“坊杂二号”“齐玉二十四号”等玉米品种间杂交种，一般能增产30％到50％，有的增产一倍多。
    但是到目前为止，全国玉米杂交种的种植面积还只有一百万亩左右。为什么玉米杂交种的推广工作还没有全面铺开？种植面积的发展还这样缓慢？马克浪等认为，这主要是农业领导部门对这项工作还没有予以足够的重视。他们建议农业领导部门，必须在已经有玉米组合并且已经取得成效的地区，迅速设置专门的玉米杂交亲本繁殖场，大力繁殖亲本种子，成为供应农业社亲本种子的基地；并责成农业院校和玉米重点产区的农业研究机关，加强玉米杂交育种工作，继续不断地选育更多、更好的杂交组合以及自交系间的杂交种；同时有计划地来讨论制订发展玉米杂交种的长远规划，并加强对各省农业技术干部的培养、训练工作，增加参观实习活动，以便在生产中更广泛地利用已经取得的科学研究成果。
    这个建议在提出以后，立即吸引了许多人的注意。农业部副总技师马矍翁等在看到了这个建议后，很快写了一张大字报，对他们提出的推广玉米杂交种的意见表示赞同和支持，他们并且要求有关部门要切实加强对玉米杂交种的经营工作，推广已经选育出的玉米杂交种，同时加强对玉米杂交种的技术传授工作，大力组织农业社自行配制杂交种。
    农业部的整风领导小组认为，这项建议对提高玉米的单位产量、增加生产有着极大的意义，并且已初步确定今后将有计划有步骤地加以推广。现在，种子局已经组织专门小组，进行了初步研究，准备明年在全国范围内进行多点试验示范，组织设立亲本繁殖基地，为1959年大量推广玉米杂交种创造条件。
