Why We Respect the Soviet Union
Khaled Azem, Syrian Minister of State and Acting Minister of Defense

On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, I am pleased to extend friendly wishes and express my admiration and respect to the Soviet people and government.

I am deeply impressed by the tremendous progress made by the Soviet Union and the great achievements of the Soviet people. Comparing what I saw during my visit to Moscow and other Soviet cities two months ago with what I had read about Russia before 1917 and its position, I realized the level of Soviet development and the achievements of the new system. I cannot fail to mention those who brought this country to such a level of prosperity, who will be immortalized in history and will forever live in the memory of a happy people.

I am not prepared to say whether this progress should be attributed to the current Soviet system, or to the talents and activities of those who led the Soviet Union during this period in politics, military affairs, economics, and culture—those who showed the people the way. Let history answer this question.

I respect the Soviet Union because, despite controlling a vast military force, she tirelessly calls for international peace and friendship.

For the welfare and happiness of mankind, and to preserve the civilization of the twentieth century, all countries in the world should adopt the principle of peaceful coexistence, which my country and many others have already adopted and which is fully effective.

We feel that the Soviet Union is earnestly implementing these noble principles.

We can also affirm with certainty that those who plunder and control other countries and those who are threatened by imperialists and demand to maintain their national sovereignty all have their eyes on the Soviet Union. The former look at it with fear and jealousy, while the latter repay it with sympathy and trust. We Syrians thank the Soviet people and the free people of Eurasia for their support of the Arab struggle for independence and for their willingness to thwart imperialist conspiracies.

We frankly say that the friendly relations between Syria and the Soviet Union are strong and no one can undermine them, because this friendship is based on mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs. Therefore, I believe that when I cheer for Soviet-Syrian friendship and bless the Soviet Union for achieving ever-increasing glory in its revolutionary cause, I am speaking on behalf of all Syrians. The Soviet Union is a free and happy country, and the flag of peace flies above it.

    我们为什么尊敬苏联
    叙利亚国务部长兼代理国防部长　哈勒德·阿泽姆
    当此十月革命四十周年之际，我高兴地向苏联人民和政府致以友好的祝愿，并表示我的钦佩和尊敬。
    苏联所取得的巨大进步和苏联人民所获得的伟大成就给予我深刻的印象。我把两个月前访问莫斯科及苏联其它城市时所看到的一切同过去我读到的关于1917年前的俄国的情况和它的地位相比较，我就认识到了苏联发展的水平和新制度的成就。我不能不提到那些使这个国家达到这样繁荣水平的人们，他们将永垂青史，并将永远地活在愉快的人民的记忆里。
    我不准备说这种进步是否应当归于苏联的现行制度，或者应当归于那些在这个时期领导苏联的政治、军事、经济和文化的人们，那些向人民指明道路的人们的才能和活动。这个问题让历史来回答吧。
    我尊敬苏联，因为尽管苏联控制着庞大的军事力量，她仍不倦地呼吁国际间的和平和友好。
    为了人类的福利和幸福，为了保存二十世纪的文明，世界上一切国家都应该采取我国和其他许多国家已经采取的、并且完全行之有效的和平共处的原则。
    我们感觉到苏联切实地执行着这些崇高的原则。
    我们也可以肯定地证实，那些四出劫夺和控制其他国家的人们和那些受帝国主义者威胁而要求维护自己国家主权的人们，他们都把眼光落在苏联身上。前者投之以恐惧和嫉妒的目光，而后者则报之以同情和信任的目光。我们叙利亚人感谢苏联人民和欧亚各国的自由的人民，因为他们支持阿拉伯的独立斗争，并表示准备挫败帝国主义的阴谋。
    我们坦白地说，叙利亚和苏联之间的友谊关系是坚强的，任何人都不能破坏它，因为这种友谊关系是在互相尊重和互不干涉内政的基础上建立起来的。因此我相信，当我欢呼苏—叙友好，并祝福苏联在它的革命事业中获致与日俱增的光荣时，我是代表全体叙利亚人发言的。苏联是一个自由和幸福的国家，在它的上空飘扬着和平的旗帜。
