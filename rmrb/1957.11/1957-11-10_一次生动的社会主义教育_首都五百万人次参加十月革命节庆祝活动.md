Xinhua News Agency, 8th: In the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, more than 4 million people in the capital generally received a vivid socialist education.

    During the festival, more than 5 million person-times in the city participated in celebration activities. Among them, organs, factories, mines, schools, stores, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and streets held more than 6,000 celebration meetings and report meetings, with more than 3 million person-times participating in these activities. There were more than 400 various large and small get-togethers, more than 700 various large and small exhibitions, and more than 1,000 screenings of films celebrating the October Revolution. The number of people participating in these activities also exceeded 2 million person-times.

    The great significance of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution has become a household name in the capital. Many workers said after hearing the reports that the happy life of the Soviet people was achieved through arduous struggle. The struggle at that time was much more difficult than ours, and life was also worse than ours. Now, we have the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to learn from, and our lives are growing very quickly. It would be very wrong if we did not build the country diligently and frugally. Many factory workers proposed launching labor competitions at the celebration meeting to create new achievements. Workers at the Beijing Wired Electric Factory launched the "Do One Good Thing" campaign to celebrate this great festival.

    In the rural areas of the suburbs, extensive and in-depth publicity activities were also carried out. About 250,000 of the 300,000 farmers in Changping District participated in celebration meetings, report meetings, discussion meetings, and visits to exhibitions introducing the Soviet Union. After participating in the celebration activities, the farmers became more determined to follow the socialist road.

    Celebration activities were also widely carried out in streets and alleys. In Dongdan District, more than 80 reporters gave 179 reports to street residents, and the vast majority of housewives and elderly people on many streets heard the reports.

    The news of the Soviet Union launching the second artificial satellite further inspired the people during the festival. After hearing the broadcast of the news from the radio station, many teachers and students of universities and colleges cheered loudly, jumped up, threw their hats into the air, and applauded enthusiastically. Students of the Civil Engineering Department of Tsinghua University said: The salvo of the cruiser Aurora of the October Revolution caused a change in the history of mankind in the world. Today's launch of this artificial satellite will not only bring about changes on Earth but also on the Moon.

    Many people pointed out during the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution that this is a world-shaking brilliant achievement of the Soviet Union in science and technology, which proves that Soviet science and technology are advancing at a rapid pace. Many people further realized the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and expressed their desire to work harder to learn from the Soviet Union.

    Soviet experts who are helping our country carry out socialist construction and Soviet students studying in China have been repeatedly invited to participate in celebration activities. Soviet friends have been invited to give reports on the October Socialist Revolution, Soviet socialist construction, and people's lives at the celebration meetings. Representatives of many workers, farmers, students, and cadres have also spoken to thank the Soviet Union for its selfless assistance in our country's construction. Soviet experts Rubin and B. Rishikov of Beijing Agricultural University were inspecting in other places. After receiving the school's invitation, they rushed back to the school to participate in the celebration meeting and accepted a banner presented to them by the teachers and students of the school. The banner was written with: "May the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people last forever."
