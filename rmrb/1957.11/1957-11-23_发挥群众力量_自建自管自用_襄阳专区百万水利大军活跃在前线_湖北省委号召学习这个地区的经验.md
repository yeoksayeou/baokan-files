Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd. Xinhua News Agency reporter reports: The Xiangyang Special Zone in Hubei Province, which spans the middle and upper reaches of the Han River, has recently had 1.5 million farmers engaged in the farmland water conservancy movement. In mid-November, I accompanied the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Visiting Group to this area. From the Sui (County)-Zao (Yang) Plain to the central hilly area of Xiangyang, and then from the central hilly area of Xiangyang into the mountains and ridges of the Wudang Mountains, I saw labor armies building dams across rivers and digging canals around mountains everywhere. They planted the red flag of "marching towards water conservancy" on the riverbanks, on the hillsides, and even on the high mountains and cliffs. Through water conservancy construction, the labor army will gradually transform this low-yield area into a high-yield area.

According to information obtained by the reporter from the leading organs of the Xiangyang Special Zone: This winter and next spring, the special zone plans to build and renovate more than 100,000 water conservancy projects of various sizes (small projects irrigating 100 to 200 mu of land are not included in the statistics), which can convert 1.5 million mu of dry land into paddy fields, and convert another 800,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land, and expand the guaranteed harvest area of the original paddy fields by more than 1 million mu. The area of dry land converted into paddy fields this winter and next spring alone is equivalent to the total area of paddy fields restored and newly converted in the entire region in the eight years since liberation. However, this is only a general planned figure, because at this time when a massive, surging water conservancy upsurge of all people has formed, it is a very difficult task to count the accurate figures of the planning and progress of water conservancy projects in the entire region or a certain county. A month ago, the number of people attending water conservancy construction in the entire special zone was 500,000, then it increased to 800,000; when we went to visit, it increased to 1 million, and in less than ten days before and after the visit, it had reached 1.5 million. The planned changes in the area of dry land converted into paddy fields in the entire region are also like this. The original plan was to convert 500,000 mu, but when we went to visit, it had expanded to 1 million mu, and when we returned from the visit, it had expanded to 1.5 million mu. When we went to visit, we saw many projects that had not yet started construction along the way, but when we came back, dams were being built everywhere, long canals were being dug, reservoirs were being built, and ponds were being dug, with crowds of people and cheers everywhere. More than 5,000 farmers in Zhaoyang County are building a large reservoir that can irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land. This reservoir is connected to a 200-li-long canal used to divert the water of the Sha River. This long canal, which looks like an "artificial canal," has also started construction in full swing. The special zone originally planned to build seven long canals over 100 li this year, but by mid-November, it had increased to twelve.

The characteristic of water conservancy construction in Xiangyang Special Zone this year is the full utilization of river water. According to what has been ascertained, there are 31 rivers over 100 li long in the entire region, and 77 rivers over 50 li long. This winter and next spring, more than 40 rivers will be developed and utilized. The common practice in various places is to block the river channels section by section, open up long canals, divert water from afar, and irrigate fields nearby; the canals are also connected to nearby ponds, weirs, and reservoirs to store water all year round, which greatly improves irrigation efficiency.

In this special zone, the large number of water conservancy projects and the large scale of the movement do not depend on national investment, but are basically carried out with the financial resources of the villages and communes themselves, adopting the method of "self-construction, self-use, and self-management."

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd. The Water Conservancy Visiting Group, led by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Secretary Zhao Xinchu, conducted a ten-day visit to the Xiangyang Special Zone. When the visit ended on the 18th, Wang Renzhong called on all localities to earnestly learn from the water conservancy construction experience of this region, quickly launch a high tide of water conservancy construction throughout the province, and make a great leap forward in agricultural production in Hubei Province next year.

During this visit, everyone was extremely interested in the systematic water conservancy construction experience created by Guanghua and Jun Counties: "Comprehensive survey, unified planning, diverting water from afar, irrigating fields nearby, blocking water section by section, opening canals around mountains, connecting canals and weirs, and storing water all year round." Zhao Gang Township in Guanghua County is sandwiched between two loess ridges, and there is a small river in the mountain ditch with a water depth of only half a foot in normal times. All the cultivated land in the township is on the hillside. Now, 25 dams have been built on this small river, and a long canal over the ridge has been opened for each dam. Each long canal is connected to many ponds, weirs, and small reservoirs. This can raise the water level and allow the river water to flow into the canal, the water in the canal irrigates the ponds, and the water in the ponds and weirs irrigates the fields. The local people call these systematic water conservancy facilities the "watermelon seedling" type. The area of paddy fields in this township has rapidly expanded from the original 300 mu to nearly 2,000 mu in two years, and will be further expanded to more than 10,000 mu next year.

When the visiting group entered Jun County in the Wudang Mountain area, they were deeply moved by the spirit of hard struggle of the people in the mountainous area in building water conservancy. Many mountains here are cliffs and precipices. In order to lead the river water along the mountain slopes to the farmland in the distance, the farmers must first split mountains and break rocks and open canals around the mountains. Every time the visitors passed a place, they could constantly hear the clanging sound of iron hammers and steel drills shaking the valleys, and the sound of rock blasting cannons. The farmers of Jun County demonstrated the high wisdom and strong perseverance of the working people in developing mountainous water conservancy. For example, the Mingxing Fourth Cooperative of Xijia Township opened a canal on a cliff; the Huohua Cooperative of Liuliping built a "sky canal" and used bamboo pipes to connect the spring water on the opposite mountain to irrigate the farmland on this mountain; a rural cadre named Zhao Dayi invented an automatic waterwheel that could lift water more than two zhang high (the masses called it "wooden water pump"). Zhao Xinchu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, praised these outstanding figures as heroes, and bold innovators of socialism.

The visiting group also visited the 200-li-long Sha River East Long Canal and a reservoir connected to the long canal that is under construction in Zhaoyang County, and also visited the farmland water conservancy irrigation network in Chegang, Sui County, and the Hei Wuwan large reservoir and other projects.

Wang Renzhong made important instructions at the symposium at the end of the visit. He said: The Guanghua County Party Committee proposed to increase the county's grain output by one time in one or two years by vigorously building water conservancy projects and converting dry land into paddy fields, and expand from the original 5,000 mu of paddy fields to 450,000 mu of paddy fields by 1962; The Jun County Party Committee also proposed to increase grain output by one time in five years. Their spirit and measures are earth-shattering events. He particularly praised the leadership methods and work style of the county party committee leading cadres and the vast number of rural cadres in these two counties who went deep into reality and worked hard, and called on rural cadres throughout the province to learn from them, and be able to be like Guanghua and Jun Counties: fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, boldly innovate, and work hard to do a good job in water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, and lay a material foundation for agricultural production next year.

The first secretaries of the four prefectural committees and more than 30 county committees of Huanggang, Jingzhou, Xiaogan, and Yichang who came to visit unanimously stated that they would widely promote the water conservancy construction experience of Guanghua and Jun Counties in the Jianghan Plain and eastern Hubei. At the end of the visit, they rushed back to convey, organize discussions, and prepare to re-plan and expand the scale of water conservancy construction to local cadres and the masses, and launch a mass upsurge of water conservancy construction.

    发挥群众力量　自建自管自用
    襄阳专区百万水利大军活跃在前线  湖北省委号召学习这个地区的经验
    新华社武汉22日电　新华社记者报道：横跨汉江中上游的湖北省襄阳专区，最近已经有一百五十万农民投入兴修农田水利运动。记者在11月中旬曾随湖北省水利参观团到这个地区参观，从随（县）枣（阳）平原到襄阳中部丘陵区，又从襄阳中部丘陵区进入丛山峻岭的武当山区，沿途看见到处都是拦河筑坝、盘山开渠的劳动大军，他们把“向水利进军”的红旗，插在河边，插在山岗上，并且插上了高山和悬崖之上。劳动大军通过兴修水利将使这一片低产区逐步变成高产区。
    据记者从襄阳专区领导机关获悉：今冬明春，这个专区计划兴修和整修的大小水利工程共有十万多处（灌田一、二百亩的小工程尚未统计在内），可以把一百五十万亩旱地改为水田，另把八十万亩旱地改为水浇地，并扩大原有水田的保收面积一百多万亩。其中仅是今冬明春改旱地为水田的面积，相当于解放八年来全区恢复和新改的水田面积的总和。但这只是一个大体的计划数字，因为在这已经形成万众齐举、汹涌澎湃的水利大高潮的时候，要想统计出全区或某一个县的水利工程的规划和工程进度的准确数字，是一件十分困难的事。一个月前，全专区兴修水利的出勤人数是五十万人，过些时候又增加到八十万人；我们去参观时又加到一百万人，参观回来前后不到十天的时间，已经达到一百五十万人。全区旱地改水田的计划变动情况也是这样，原计划改五十万亩，我们去参观时已经扩大到一百万亩，参观回来时又扩大到一百五十万亩。我们去参观时，沿路看到还有许多工程没有开工，回来时已经到处都在筑河坝，开长渠，修水库，挖堰塘，人山人海，欢声遍野。枣阳县五千多农民正在修建一座可以灌溉一万多亩田的大水库，这座水库和一条用来引沙河的水的二百余里的长渠相连，这条像是“人工运河”的长渠也全面动工了。这个专区原计划今年新修百里以上的长渠七条，到11月中旬已经增加到十二条。
    襄阳专区今年兴修水利的特点，是充分地利用了河水。据已查明，全区有百里以上的河流三十一条，长五十里以上的有七十七条，今冬明春将有四十多条河流被开发利用。各地普遍的做法是把河道节节拦水，开辟长渠，远处引水，近处灌田；渠道又和附近的塘、堰、水库相连，常年蓄水，这样就大大提高了灌溉效益。
    在这个专区里，水利工程之多，运动规模之大，并没有依赖国家的投资，基本上都是以各乡、各社自己的财力来搞，采取“自建、自用、自管”的办法。
    新华社武汉22日电　由中共湖北省委第一书记王任重和书记赵辛初率领的水利参观团，在襄阳专区进行了为期十天的参观。18日结束参观时，王任重号召各地认真学习这个地区的水利建设经验，迅速在全省范围内掀起一个兴修水利运动的高潮，使明年湖北省的农业生产来个大跃进。
    这次参观中，大家对光化、均县创造的“全面勘察，统一规划，远处引水，近处灌田，节节拦水，盘山开渠，渠堰相连，常年蓄水”的系统的水利建设经验，感到极大的兴趣。光化县赵岗乡被夹在两条黄土岭当中，山沟里有条平时水深不过半尺的小河，全乡的耕地全部在山坡上。现在，在这条小河上修筑了二十五道拦河坝，每道河坝开辟了一条盘山过岭的长渠，每条长渠又连结了许多塘、堰和小水库。这样就能抬高水位使河水流进渠道，渠里的水灌塘，塘、堰里的水浇田。当地群众对这些系统的水利设施取名叫“西瓜秧”式。这个乡的水田面积在两年内由原来的三百亩迅速扩大到近两千亩，明年将再扩大到一万多亩。
    当参观团进入武当山区的均县以后，深为山区人民建设水利的艰苦奋斗精神所感动。这里的许多山都是绝壁悬崖，农民们为了把河水沿山坡引向远处的农田，首先要劈山破石、盘山开渠。参观的人们每经过一个地方，不时地可以听到震动山谷的铁锤钢钻的叮噹声，和开山石炮的??声。均县农民在开发山区水利中表现了劳动人民的高度智慧和坚强的毅力，如习家店明星四社在悬崖陡壁上开渠；六里坪火花社修了一道“天渠”，用竹管子将对山上的泉水接过来灌本山上的农田，一个叫赵大义的农村干部发明了能够提水两丈多高的自动戽斗水车（群众称它为“木造的抽水机”）。委省书记赵辛初称赞这些优秀人物是英雄好汉，是社会主义的大胆革新者。
    参观团还参观了枣阳县正在修建的长达二百多里的沙河河东长渠和与长渠相连的一个水库，又参观了随县车岗的农田水利灌溉网和黑屋湾大水库等工程。
    王任重在参观结束的座谈会上作了重要指示，他说：光化县委提出通过大规模兴修水利、改旱地为水田，争取在一、二年内把全县粮食产量增加一倍，到1962年由原来的五千亩水田扩大到四十五万亩水田；均县县委也提出在五年内把粮食产量增加一倍。他们这种精神和措施，是翻天覆地的大事。他特别表扬了这两个县的县委领导干部和广大农村干部深入实际、艰苦奋斗的领导方法和工作作风，号召全省农村干部应向他们学习，都能够像光化、均县这样：充分发动群众，依靠群众，大胆革新，艰苦奋斗，来搞好水利建设和积肥运动，为明年的农业生产打下物质基础。
    前来参观的黄冈、荆州、孝感、宜昌等四个地委和三十多个县委的第一书记，一致表示要把光化、均县的水利建设经验在江汉平原和鄂东地区广泛推广。他们在参观结束时，就匆忙地赶回去向本地干部和群众传达，组织讨论，准备重新规划和扩大水利建设规模，掀起群众性的兴修水利大高潮。（附图片）
