    "The Blackboard Newspaper Editor" is a Good Work

    I was deeply moved after reading the short story "The Blackboard Newspaper Editor" published in your newspaper on October 20th.

    This is a short story with the theme of the older and younger generations of workers in a factory caring for and cherishing state property. Comrade Kang Tieshan, the author, has written about the excellent qualities of seemingly ordinary people in our era, which has profound socialist educational significance. The plot of the story is tortuous and captivating, and it is indeed a relatively successful work. I suggest that your newspaper publish more short stories or features describing the excellent qualities of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the future.

    “黑板报编辑”是一篇好作品
    读了你报10月20日刊登的一篇题为“黑板报编辑”的小说后，深受感动。
    这是一篇以工厂中新老两代工人关心和爱护国家财产为题材的小说。作者康铁山同志写出了我们这一时代里看来极为平凡的人的优秀品质，具有深刻的社会主义教育意义。小说情节曲折，引人入胜，确是一篇比较成功的作品。建议你报今后多刊登些描写工农兵优秀品质的小说或特写。
