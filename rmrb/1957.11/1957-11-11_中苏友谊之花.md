    The Flower of Sino-Soviet Friendship
    Shi Ziming, Director of Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant
    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant is one of the 156 key projects aided by the Soviet Union in our country's construction, and it is also China's first heavy machine tool plant. After completion, it will produce heavy-duty metal cutting machine tools such as 8-meter vertical lathes, 14-meter gantry planers, gantry milling machines, spiral milling machines, and boring machines. These products used to be purchased with foreign exchange; a single 7288-type gantry planer would cost more than 2 million yuan. The plant urgently needed to be completed as soon as possible to meet the needs of national construction, but due to complex technology and lack of experience, it was originally designed in three stages and built in two phases, with full production scheduled for 1960. Later, at the suggestion of the relevant Soviet authorities, it was changed to two-stage design, advancing the date by one and a half years, with full production in the third quarter of 1958, to supply the country's ever-increasing need for heavy machine tools earlier. The task was arduous, and time was pressing. The first problem encountered was that the design and equipment supply could not keep up. However, the Soviet Union strongly supported us in accelerating the pace and decided to deliver the design drawings one to one and a half years in advance. Except for a few large pieces of equipment whose supply was slightly delayed due to long production cycles, all other equipment fully met our requirements. This timely assistance from the Soviet Union was a great encouragement to all the workers and staff of our plant.
    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant has a total of fifty-eight construction projects. Since the start of the plant's construction in February 1956, thirty-eight projects have been basically completed, and twelve are under construction. Of the plant's twenty-two workshops, nine have been fully or partially put into production. Indeed, without exaggeration, this achievement is a flower of friendship cultivated by the labor of the people of China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union not only designed the factory for us, provided us with many major machines and equipment, supplied product design drawings, process documents, production organization designs, and other important technical data, but also sent experts to guide our work specifically from the selection of the factory site. At present, there are fifteen experts working in the factory, including Comrade Badulin, the leader of the expert group, as well as designers and process engineers. They are all technically excellent, conscientious, and treat the factory as their home.
    When the campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched this year, all the experts in the plant also held discussions and made specific considerations from the aspects of design and substitution of equipment and materials. Since the beginning of this year, the important suggestions put forward by the experts have improved our work and saved 176,000 yuan (that can be directly calculated) and 120 tons of steel.
    In short, we will never forget the help of the Soviet people and Soviet experts. We must build the flower of friendship—the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant—cultivated by the labor of the people of China and the Soviet Union into a successful factory, and commemorate this great festival with the production of excellent products.

    中苏友谊之花
    武汉重型机床厂厂长　史梓铭
    武汉重型机床厂是苏联全面帮助我国建设的一百五十六项重点工程之一，是我国第一座重型机床厂。建成以后，将生产八米立式车床、十四米龙门刨床、龙门铣床、螺旋铣床、镗床等重型的金属切削机床。这些产品，以往都是用外汇购买，一台7288型龙门刨床，就需二百多万元。这个工厂急需早日建成适应国家建设需要，但由于技术复杂、经验不足等原因，所以原来分三段设计、两期建设，1960年全面投入生产。之后，经苏联有关方面建议改为两段设计，提前一年半，1958年第三季度全面投入生产，提早供应国家对重型机床愈来愈多的需要。任务是艰巨的，时间是紧迫的，首先碰到的问题是设计和设备的供应赶不上。但是，苏联很支持我们加快速度，决定设计图纸提早一年到一年半交付，设备除个别重大型设备因生产周期长供应稍晚以外，其他全部满足了我们的要求。苏联这种及时的援助，对我们全厂职工是一个很大的鼓舞。
    武汉重型机床厂一共有五十八个工程项目，从1956年2月开始兴建厂区建筑工程，一年多以来，已基本竣工的有三十八个，正在施工的十二个。全厂二十二个车间，已经有九个全部或部分投入生产。的确，毫不夸大的说，这个成就是中苏两国人民用劳动培植起来的一朵友谊之花。苏联不仅为我们设计了工厂，供给我们许多主要的机器设备，供给产品设计图纸，工艺文件，生产组织设计等重要技术资料，还从选择厂址开始，陆续派来了专家具体指导我们的工作。现在有专家工作组组长巴杜林同志和设计师、工艺师等十五位专家在厂工作，他们都是技术优良、认真负责、视厂如家的人。
    当今年开展增产节约运动的时候，全厂专家也进行了讨论，从设计、设备材料代用方面作了具体考虑。今年以来，专家提出的重要建议，改进了我们的工作，还节约了一十七万六千元（可以直接计算的），钢材一百二十吨。
    总之，苏联人民、苏联专家的帮助，是使我们永远忘记不了的。我们要把中苏两国人民用劳动培植起来的友谊之花——武汉重型机床厂建成建好，用生产优良的产品来纪念这个伟大的节日。
