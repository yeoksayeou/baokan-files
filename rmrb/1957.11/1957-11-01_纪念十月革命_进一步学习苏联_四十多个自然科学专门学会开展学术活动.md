To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, around the time of the October Revolution Day, over forty natural science societies affiliated with the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies will successively hold a series of academic activities. These include inviting Soviet experts to report on the development and achievements of Soviet science, and holding discussions on the progress made in various disciplines in China in learning from the Soviet Union in recent years, in order to further learn from the Soviet Union. The report meetings that have already been held or will be held include: The Chinese Association of Automation invited Soviet Professor A. A. Andronov to speak on "Soviet Work Experience in Production Process Automation"; the Chinese Mathematical Society invited Soviet expert Bitzadze to speak on "Forty Years of Mathematical Achievements in the Soviet Union"; the Geographical Society of China invited Soviet Professor Samoilov to speak on "Forty Years of Geographical Science Achievements in the Soviet Union"; the Chinese Society of Electrical Engineering invited Soviet expert Roskutov to speak on "New Achievements in Soviet Power Engineering"; the Chinese Meteorological Society invited Soviet expert Kletchmir to speak on "Forty Years of Upper Air Meteorology Development in the Soviet Union"; the Chinese Society for Metals invited Soviet expert Ivanchenko to speak on "Forty Years of Ferrous Metallurgical Industry and Research Work in the Soviet Union"; the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery invited Soviet expert Gololobov to speak on "Achievements of Soviet Agricultural Machinery"; the Entomological Society of China invited Soviet expert Yakhontov from Beijing Agricultural University to speak on "Forty Years of Entomology Development in the Soviet Union"; the Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society invited Soviet expert Bannikov to speak on "Achievements of Soviet Rural Hydroelectric Power Stations"; the Chinese Society for Horticultural Science invited Soviet Professor Dragavtsev to speak on "Recent Developments and Achievements in Soviet Fruit Science"; the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association invited Soviet expert Kiryanov to speak on "Forty Years of Research on Medicinal Plants in the Soviet Union"; the Anatomical Society of China invited Soviet Professor Bykov to speak on "The Development of Neuro-morphology".

Some societies are holding small symposiums to discuss Soviet scientific achievements and experiences in learning from the Soviet Union. The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics invited Qian Xuesen to speak on "Mechanical Problems in Artificial Satellites." The Chinese Psychological Society will discuss "Learning from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union to Further Establish New Psychology in the Motherland." The Geological Society of China will discuss "The Soviet Union's Selfless Assistance to China's Geological Work," and "Summary, Insights and Experiences in Learning from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union in the Past Seven Years." The Medical Association and the Pharmaceutical Association will discuss "Achievements in Learning from the Soviet Union," etc.

Dozens of academic journals (transactions, translated reports, bulletins, magazines, abstracts, etc.) edited by various specialized societies have organized contributions celebrating the October Revolution, introducing Soviet scientific achievements and the experiences and achievements of Chinese scientific workers in learning from the Soviet Union. For example, the Physics Bulletin will publish articles such as "Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy," "Artificial Earth Satellites," "Observation of Radio Signals Emitted by Artificial Earth Satellites and Its Scientific Significance," "Artificial Satellites and Cosmic Rays," and "Forty Years of Achievements in Soviet Physics Teaching." The Chemistry Bulletin will publish two articles, including "Forty Years of Achievements in Soviet Organic Chemistry." The Biological Bulletin will publish an article written by Qin Renchang and Hou Xueyu entitled "Forty Years of Achievements in Soviet Botany." The Mathematical Bulletin will publish seven articles, including "The Development of Computational Mathematics in the Soviet Union" and "Learning from the Soviet Union's Achievements in Partial Differential Equations." Geographical Knowledge focuses on learning from advanced Soviet geography, publishing thirteen articles on learning from Soviet geographical science. Some publications have also published editorials expressing gratitude to the Soviet Union for its help to China's scientific undertakings.

The Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery will hold a small exhibition to display pictures of the achievements of Soviet agricultural machinery, introducing the great achievements of the Soviet Union in agricultural machinery over the past forty years.

Each specialized society will also send telegrams to relevant Soviet scientific organizations to congratulate them on this great holiday.
