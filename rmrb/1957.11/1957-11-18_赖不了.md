Title: Can't Deny It

Chi Bei'ou deserves to die, deserves to die! Diplomatic documents actually fell into the hands of others, not only exposing the subversion plot in Jakarta but also revealing the acts of interfering in the internal affairs of Asian countries. Terrible, terrible! The true face of imperialism is seen by everyone. Needless to say, the prestige of the United States will be even lower, and anti-American sentiment will be even higher everywhere. Don't be afraid, don't be afraid! Still using the old method of outright denial, "The header of the telegram is not our header," "The wording of the document is not our usual parlance." Ridiculous, ridiculous! How can white paper and black letters be denied? It is better to say: there are these two telegrams, but the duplicates have not been lost.

After the exposure of the two secret documents lost by the US Embassy in Taipei, they were very embarrassed and flatly denied it, saying that the telegram numbers were wrong and the wording was unlike them, and so on.

    赖不了
  　池北偶该死，该死！外交文件竟落到人家手里，不仅在雅加达的颠覆阴谋败露，干涉亚洲各国内政的行径也泄了底。糟糕，糟糕！帝国主义的真面目人人看到，不用说，美国的声望将更低落，各处的反美情绪会更加高。不怕，不怕！还是用矢口抵赖的老办法，“电报的号头不是我们的号头”，“文件的措词不是我们惯说的行话。”可笑，可笑！白纸黑字怎么赖得了？倒不如说：这样两份电报是有的，只不过副本并没有丢掉。
    美国驻台北大使馆遗失的两份秘密文件被揭露后，甚为狼狈，竟矢口否认，说什么电报号码不对，措词不像云云。
