Singing the Triumphant Song of the October Revolution
Xiao San
    I sing of "the first song,
              A triumphant song that resounds through the clouds." [Note]
    I sing of the great
              October Socialist Revolution.
    The sound of the October Revolution's cannons shook every corner of the earth.
    The red light of October opened the eyes of all mankind.
    If Mayakovsky said back then:
          "This is—my revolution";
    Then now, everyone knows:
    The October Revolution brought new life to everyone.

    I sing of the October Revolution, it is mankind's second sun.
    It rises and disperses the dark clouds and heavy fog of the old society.
    It emits hundreds of millions of brilliant golden rays,
    Illuminating the future of all human history!

    Old man, you have reached the age of eighty,
                        I wish you longevity!
    Fortunately, you have gained light and warmth in the last forty years.
    In the previous forty years, I dare say, life was quite terrible:
    You remember, that society, that world, how dark and miserable!
    Like us, people in their sixties, it's even better:
    Two-thirds of our time has not been wasted.
    People in their forties can especially proudly claim to be "contemporaries":
    All are "products" of the October Revolution...
    I want to say, to generally younger friends,
    You must never be unaware of the happiness you enjoy!
    I myself am very honored to have been
                                a free son of October,
    For more than a dozen years, I lived in the Soviet big family.
    On many revolutionary anniversary celebrations
    I marched solemnly in Red Square.
    This year I have come to the Soviet Union again—my second home.
    It is filled with the scene of youth festivities.
    My Moscow! It is even more beautiful, even more gorgeous.
    More than 30,000 young people from 130 countries sing in unison.
    Now, as I am still immersed in the atmosphere of the festival,
    I hear signals from one artificial satellite after another
                              sent from the sky.
    Two red moons are already orbiting the earth,
    Greeting and sending regards to the people of Beijing and major cities around the world.
    People are overjoyed, treating them as doves of peace,
                            as auspicious stars and stars of fortune.
    Those with ulterior motives, helplessly, call it "a piece of iron."
    Let the warmongers tremble, lie, and blackmail!
    People only feel that this gift is extraordinarily lovely and kind.
    Look, two lively little red moons
    Are soaring freely in the heavens.
    People feel that they have also been elevated, reaching the sky,
    As if they have grown a pair of wings.
    On the ground, a Yangtze River Bridge has been erected,
    To connect vehicles from Paris to Guangzhou.
    I sing of the achievements of the children of October—the Soviet people.
    I sing of this bridge of great Sino-Soviet friendship.

    Friends, the October Revolution has now passed forty years.
    In these forty years, how many changes have taken place in the world!
    Nine hundred million people in Eurasia
                            enjoy complete freedom under the October sunshine.
    People of all races in Asia and Africa are also striving
                            to break free from the chains on their bodies.
    Friends, imagine, by the second fortyth anniversary of the October Revolution,
    What a happy and peaceful life mankind will be living.
    At that time, let us sing another
                            triumphant song that resounds through the clouds,
    (The first line of the lyrics should be: "Thank you, our Big Brother!")
    At that time, let us sing a brand new "Internationale,"
    And then sing another song
                that resounds even
                                higher and farther in the clouds, the "Interstellar Song"!

   [Note] The article "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" states: "The basic experience of the Soviet revolution and construction is a great success, and it is the first triumphant song of Marxism-Leninism resounding through the clouds in human history."

### 歌唱十月革命的凯歌

    歌唱十月革命的凯歌
    萧三我歌唱“第一曲
              响彻云霄的　凯歌”。〔注〕我歌唱　伟大的
              十月　社会主义　革命。十月的炮声　震撼了　地球的　每个角落。十月的红光　给全人类　都睁开了眼睛。假如　当年　马雅可夫斯基　这样说道：十月革命
          “这是——我的革命”；那么　现在　所有的人　谁都分晓：十月革命　给每个人　带来了　新的生命。我歌唱　十月革命，它是人类的　第二轮太阳。它升起来　驱散了　旧社会的　黑云密雾。它发射出　亿万道　辉煌灿烂的　金光，照耀着　整个　人类历史的　前途！老人家，您到了　八十高龄，
                        我祝您长生不老！好的是，四十年来，您获得了　光明、温暖。那前四十年，我敢说，生活的　相当糟糕：您记得，那社会，那世道，多么黑暗、悲惨！像我们，六十岁的人，那就更好：三分之二的　光阴，没有　虚度。四十岁的人　尤其　可以“同庚”自豪：全部　都是　十月革命的　“产物”……我想说，一般　更加年轻的　朋友，你们　千万　不要　在福不知福！我自己　很荣幸，曾经是　十月的
                                自由的儿子，前后十多个　年头　我住在　苏维埃大家庭。多少个　革命周年　庆祝的日子我都在　庄严的　红场上　大踏步　行进。今年　我又到了　苏联——我的　第二个故乡。那里　充满了　青年　联欢的　景象。我的莫斯科！　它更加美了，更加　漂亮了。百三十个国家的　三万多青年人　齐声歌唱。现在，当我　还沉浸在联欢节的　气氛里，听到了　一个又一个　人造卫星
                              从天空发来的　信号。已经有　两个　红色月亮　绕着地球　打圈子，向北京，向世界各大都市的人民　致意、问好。人民欢天喜地，把它们　当作和平鸽子，
                            当作　吉星和福星。别有用心的人，无可奈何，说它是“一块铁”。让战争贩子们　发抖、撒谎、讹诈吧！人民只觉得，这种礼物　格外的可爱、亲切。看呀，两个　活泼的　红色　小月亮在那　九霄云外　自由地　翱翔。人们都觉得，自己也跟着　提高了，到了天上，恍惚　自己身上　生长了　一对翅膀。在地上　又架起了　一座　长江大桥，为了　连结　从巴黎　到广州的　车辆。我歌唱　十月的儿女——苏联人的　一切功劳。我歌唱　这座　中苏　伟大友谊的　桥梁。朋友，十月革命　到现在　度过了　四十个春秋。这四十年呀，世界上　发生了　多少变迁！欧亚九亿人民　在十月的阳光下
                            享受　完全的自由。亚非各色人种　也都在　努力
                            挣断　身上的锁链。朋友，你想，到十月的　第二个　四十周年，人类　将要过　一种　多么幸福的、和平的生活。那时候，让我们　再唱　一曲
                            响彻云霄的　凯歌，（歌词的　第一句　该是：　“感谢　我们的老大哥！”）那时候，让我们　唱一曲　崭新的　“国际歌”，然后　再唱　一曲
                在云霄里　响得
                                更高　更远的“星际歌”！
   〔注〕“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”文中说：“苏联革命和建设的基本经验是一个伟大的成功，是马克思列宁主义在人类历史上第一曲响彻云霄的凯歌”。
