Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang. Liaoning Province is vigorously building mountain roads to promote the development of mountainous areas, which account for 60% of the province's total area.

    In mid-November, in Buyunshan Township, Zhuanghe County, Liaoning Province, a 3.5-kilometer highway was built relying on the efforts of the farmers themselves, enabling the 400,000 jin of mountain fruits produced in this township every year to be transported out in a timely manner as raw materials for winemaking. At the same time, the people living locally no longer have to travel more than 30 li to buy grain.

    In the past two years, the development of mountain roads in Liaoning Province has been rapid. Only five counties including Gaiping, Yi County, and Beizhen have opened up 46 large and small mountain passes and built more than 150 kilometers of new roads. Gaiping County opened up the "Wan'er Ridge," which had blocked people's access for thousands of years, enabling a large number of apples from the mountainous areas to be transported out in a timely manner. The lives of farmers in the mountainous areas have also improved, and people call this ridge "Happiness Ridge."

    In order to develop mountain roads more and better, the Liaoning Provincial Department of Transportation decided to plan three types of mountain roads next year: opening up the main lines in the mountains, connecting special product producing areas with major highways, and opening up some major mountain passes. Various localities will also make full use of automobiles, animal-drawn vehicles, wooden sailboats, and all folk transportation tools to expand mountain service lines and business stations, and gradually form automobile and animal-drawn vehicle transportation networks based on producing areas and supply and marketing stations, and automobile and carriage transportation networks based on market towns and townships.

    让山区道路四通八达
    辽宁大力建设山区交通网
    据新华社沈阳电　辽宁省大力修建山区道路，以促进占全省面积60％的山区生产的发展。
    11月中旬，在辽宁省的庄河县步云山乡，依靠农民自己的力量，修建了一条长三点五公里的公路，使这个乡每年生产的四十万斤山果能够及时运出来，作为酿酒的原料。同时，居住当地的人们再也不用绕走三十多里的路去买粮了。
    近两年来辽宁省山区道路发展很快，仅盖平、义县、北镇等五个县就开通了大小山岭四十六处，新筑公路一百五十多公里。盖平县打通了千百年来阻挡人民出路的“万儿岭”，使山区大量苹果及时运出，山区农民生活也随着改善，人们把这个岭叫作“幸福岭”。
    为了更多更好地发展山区道路，辽宁省交通运输部门决定在明年有计划地开辟三种类型山区道路，就是把山区当中主要干线打通，把特产品产地和主要公路连结起来，同时开辟一些主要山岭。各地还将充分利用汽车、兽力车、木帆船和一切民间运输工具，扩大山区服务线路和营业站点，逐渐组成以产地、供销站点为基点的汽车、兽力车运输网，以集镇、乡为基点的汽车、马车运输网。
