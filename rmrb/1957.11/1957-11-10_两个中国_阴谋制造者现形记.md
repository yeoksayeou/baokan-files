    Record of the Exposure of Conspirators of "Two Chinas"

      Sneaky Behavior
    One afternoon, a suspicious and sneaky person suddenly appeared at the registration desk of the 19th International Red Cross Conference at the Science Palace in Delhi. He was carrying a briefcase and looked furtive. He said his name was S.T. Chen, and he claimed to be an advisor to a man named Hang Liwu. He requested permission to attend the meeting and to register both of them as representatives of the "Republic of China." However, the registration desk bluntly rejected this request.
    What ill wind blew them to this International Red Cross Conference? It turned out that when these two arrived at Delhi Airport on a cold night in India, the only person waiting to meet them was an American delegate. And shortly before their arrival, the U.S. delegation had maliciously put forward a proposal at the conference requesting that each delegation invited to attend the conference be addressed by their "respective formal names," which meant that the Chiang Kai-shek clique should have representatives at the meeting and be called representatives of the "Republic of China."
    The Chinese delegation had long detected this American conspiracy. Before the U.S. put forward this proposal, head of the delegation Li Dequan had protested and put forward an emergency motion at the conference requesting the conference to reject this conspiracy. The newspapers here also published the Chinese delegation's protest in prominent positions. However, the American conspiracy was realized through François-Poncet. François-Poncet sent a telegram to the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique to the effect as above.

      Conspirators' Old Tune
    The U.S. delegation played its only tune, saying that the conference was "non-political" and humanitarian in nature, and that the Red Cross family should not abandon the "child" of the "Republic of China." But who can find ivory in a dog's mouth? The gentleman who said those words was Robert McClintock, and he, as he himself admitted, was receiving direct instructions from the U.S. State Department. Another head of the U.S. Red Cross delegation, Glonzer, was a notorious general of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, who had been in the U.S. military for thirty-eight years and only joined the Red Cross shortly before this conference. It is worth noting that this general once said during the conference's discussion of opposing hydrogen bomb testing: "American atomic tests are harmless." Now, these remarks have overnight become "non-political and humanitarian"!
    Just as the Chinese delegation and other national delegations were sitting together in the various committees of the conference, striving to find common ground and pass proposals on the protection of civilians and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, the impatient U.S. delegation repeatedly exerted pressure, demanding that a plenary session be convened as soon as possible to discuss their proposal to conspire to create "Two Chinas." But this request was frankly rejected by Chairman Cowl. Later, news was heard that ten countries had threatened to withdraw from the meeting if the U.S. proposal was not considered. At the same time, booklets entitled "Activities of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China," containing many praises for American donations to this "society," were distributed at the conference venue.
    The day of the plenary session finally arrived. McClintock began the debate on the U.S. proposal with his ridiculous speech. He again demanded that the conference receive the "child" of the "Republic of China." But after discovering that he could not present any reasons to prove his argument, he began to tell the story of the "Muna bird" to amuse the delegates. He said that this bird often visited him in his hotel room to chat with him and ask him to uphold "justice."

      China's Voice of Justice
    The head of the Chinese government delegation, Pan Zili, forcefully refuted the U.S. sophistry. He traced the history of the long-standing American conspiracy and refuted the claim that the so-called "government of the Republic of China" was a signatory to several Red Cross conventions and should therefore be invited to attend the conference. He questioned: The former Qing government of China was also a signatory to the 1864 Geneva Convention, should its remnants also be invited to attend this conference? Pan Zili's speech won prolonged and enthusiastic applause, despite the Canadian Macaulay, who served as chairman, impolitely interrupting almost every sentence of Pan Zili's. When Pan Zili returned to his seat, many African and Asian representatives came over to shake his hand.
    Delegates one after another forcefully refuted the U.S. proposal and exposed its so-called "non-political nature." Soviet representative Mitelev said, when talking about China, that the U.S. government representative was closing his eyes to the changing times.
    The heads of our friendly host country India's delegation, Kamakar and Cowl, also issued strong warnings: Only the People's Republic of China is qualified to sit here, and if the U.S. proposal is passed, they will not be able to cooperate with the conference. Due to the repeated raising of procedural issues and arguments by various delegations, the entire day of November 6 passed in this way. Fifteen hours of the conference's plenary session were spent debating the U.S. proposal. Many delegations warned that the U.S. proposal had brought the conference to the brink of collapse. It was under this unanimous pressure that the U.S. was finally forced to push its proposal to the last item on the conference's agenda.

  More Than Half the World's Population Withdraws from the Conference
    On the afternoon of November 7, the meeting was filled with a tense atmosphere. Many messages about talks between the U.S. and other delegations could be heard in the venue. One could also see some American women from the U.S. delegation busily shuttling between some delegations in the hall, maintaining contact. When Chairman Cowl announced that a secret ballot would be held on the U.S. proposal, McClintock jumped onto the podium and angrily demanded that Cowl announce the names of those who requested a secret ballot, and arrogantly threatened that "the U.S. delegation is very interested in the names of these people." However, amid a burst of laughter in the venue, he was decisively rejected by Cowl.
    The result of the vote was not surprising. The conference passed the U.S. proposal under U.S. manipulation.
    After the voting result was announced, Pan Zili immediately stepped onto the podium, forcefully pointed out that the U.S.'s manipulation to pass the U.S. proposal was a despicable act, and announced that our delegation was withdrawing from the conference. The Chinese government delegation and the Chinese Red Cross delegation, led by Pan Zili and Li Dequan, then walked out of the venue. Before walking out, our delegation also removed the signs bearing the names of the Chinese delegation from their seats. Our delegation requested the conference staff to take down our national flag to prevent it from being insulted.
    On the street, reporters heard people scolding the U.S. as "bad guys" when they saw our national flag being taken down and learned that our delegation had withdrawn from the conference. When people saw the Indian Red Cross delegation led by Cowl and the Soviet delegation withdrawing from the conference hall one after another, they applauded this spirit of upholding justice and mutual support with deep sympathy.
    Twenty-nine delegations from eighteen countries announced their withdrawal from the conference one after another. The conference hall fell into chaos and unease, with only the U.S. delegation sitting there pretending to be calm. It was pointed out that due to the American conspiracy, more than half of the world's population had withdrawn from the conference.

      Thieves Sneaking into the Hall
    At the same time, two members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique had been hiding in a remote corner of a restaurant in the same building, anxiously awaiting the result of the vote. From time to time, one could see an American walking over to them, chattering about the situation inside the conference hall. After so many delegations withdrew, an American led them to the conference registration desk and then brought them into the conference hall. They sneaked into the hall like thieves, sitting in the empty seats of the Chinese delegation, while an American delegate also sat in the seat behind them, monitoring them. This gave a very strong impression that they were merely puppets in the hands of the United States. These two guys looked around with a pitiful appearance, trying to avoid contact with the eyes of other delegates. When a large number of photographers gathered around to take pictures, they lowered their heads, appearing to have nowhere to hide.
    Pan Zili held a press conference after withdrawing from the conference. He loudly declared that China would never allow a situation of "Two Chinas" to appear at any international conference, and would never recognize the U.S. occupation of China's Taiwan. A large number of journalists attending the press conference listened intently to his speech. When McClintock heard about the press conference, he also wanted to defend himself, but could only find a small group of reporters. He used every word he could to slander China and the host of the conference. He also insulted Cowl, telling reporters that Cowl had "intimidated" the U.S. delegation, and even shamelessly said, "Between principle and a charming princess (referring to Cowl), I prefer principle."

    U.S. True Colors Fully Exposed
    The International Red Cross Conference has concluded. The true colors of the United States have been fully exposed. But, contrary to the hopes of the U.S. delegation, the 600 million Chinese people have gained such profound friendship.
    There is an old saying in India: "Whether invited or not, I am still your guest." Since this incident occurred at the International Red Cross Conference, people in the Indian capital have been quoting this old saying to describe the "guests" invited by the United States. I have repeatedly heard Indian friends say: "Today it is the issue of 'Two Chinas,' tomorrow they may also target Goa or Kashmir and raise the issue of 'Two Indias.'" They questioned, if someone also claimed to be a representative of California and demanded to attend this conference, what would the United States say?
    It is not difficult for people to draw the conclusion from this conference that the United States originally hoped to play the role of a hero at the conference, but ended up becoming a ridiculous clown. How can the fox's tail still be hidden without being seen by the whole world? (Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 9th)

    “两个中国”阴谋制造者现形记
    新华社驻新德里记者　高梁
      鬼鬼祟祟的行径
    一天下午，设在德里科学宫的第十九届国际红十字大会的登记处忽然出现了一个形迹可疑、鬼鬼祟祟的人。他挟着一个皮包，神色诡秘。他说他叫S·T·陈，并且自称是一个叫做杭立武的人的顾问。他要求允许他出席会议，并且把他们两个人登记为“中华民国”的代表。可是，登记处直截了当地拒绝了这个要求。
    是什么黑风把他们刮到本届国际红十字大会来的呢？原来当这两个人在印度的一个寒冷的深夜到达德里机场时，等在那里接他们的唯一的人是一个美国代表。而就在他们到达之前不久，美国代表团别有用心地在大会上提出了一个提案，要求用“各自的正式名称”称呼每个被邀出席大会的代表团，那就是说，蒋介石集团应该有代表出席会议，并且要称他为“中华民国的代表”。
    中国代表团很早就发觉了美国这个阴谋。在美国提出这个提案之前，李德全团长就曾经提出抗议，并且在大会上提出紧急动议要求大会驳斥这个阴谋。这里的报纸也在显著地位登载了中国代表团的抗议。可是，美国的阴谋通过弗朗索瓦—庞赛而实现了。弗朗索瓦—庞赛向台湾蒋介石集团的“中华民国外交部”发出了大意如上的电报。
      阴谋者的老调子
    美国代表团弹起它唯一的调子，那就是，说什么这个大会是“非政治性”和人道主义性质的，红十字会大家庭不应该丢弃“中华民国”这个“孩子”。但是谁能够在狗嘴里找到象牙呢？说那些话的这位先生是罗伯特·麦克林托克，而他，正如他自己所承认的，是接受美国国务院的直接指示的。美国红十字会代表团的另一首脑格仑瑟，原是侵略性的北大西洋公约组织的臭名远扬的将军，在美军中呆了三十八年，他是在这次大会开会以前不久才参加红十字会的。值得注意的是，这位将军在大会讨论反对氢弹试验时曾经说过：“美国的原子试验是没有害处的。”现在，这些言论却又在一夜之间变成了“非政治性的和人道主义的”了！
    正当中国代表团和其他国家的代表团在大会的各种委员会里坐在一起努力寻找共同的基础，并通过关于保护平民和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的提案的时候，不耐烦的美国代表团一再施加压力，要求早日召开全体会议讨论他们阴谋制造“两个中国”的提案。但是这个要求遭到主席考尔女士的率直拒绝。后来，就听到有消息说，有十个国家扬言，如果不考虑美国提案，它们就要退出会议。同时又有人在会议地点散发叫做“中华民国红十字会的活动”的小册子，其中有许多赞扬美国对这个“会”的捐助的话。
    全体会议复会的日子终于到来了。麦克林托克以他的可笑的发言开始了关于美国提案的辩论。他又要求大会接待“中华民国”这个“孩子”。但是他在发现他提不出任何理由来证明他的论点后，便开始谈论“穆那鸟”的故事来使代表们开心。他说，这种鸟常常到他的旅馆房间里去访问他同他闲谈，要他主持“正义”。
      中国的正义声音
    中国政府代表团团长潘自力有力地驳斥了美国的诡辩。他追溯了美国长期以来的阴谋的历史，并且驳斥了所谓“中华民国政府”是几个红十字公约的缔约国，因而应该被邀请参加大会的说法。他质问：中国的前清政府也曾经是1864年日内瓦公约的缔约国，难道也应该邀请它的残余分子来参加本届大会吗？潘自力的发言博得了长时间的热烈欢呼，尽管担任主席的加拿大的马考莱十分无礼地几乎打断了潘自力的每一句话。当潘自力回到他的坐位的时候，好些亚非代表过来和他握手。
    代表们一个接一个对美国的提案予以有力的驳斥，并揭穿了它的所谓“非政治性质”。苏联代表米捷列夫在谈到中国时说，美国政府代表对于正在改变的时代是闭着眼睛不看的。
    我们友好的东道国印度的代表团团长卡马卡尔和考尔女士也提出了强硬的警告：只有中华人民共和国才有资格坐在这里，如果美国的提案被通过的话，他们就不能和大会合作。由于各代表团一再提出了议事规则问题，并且提出了论点，11月6日整天的会议就这样过去了。大会全体会议的十五小时都花在辩论美国的提案上。很多代表团警告说，美国的提案已经使大会到了破裂的边缘。就是在这种一致的压力下，美国终于被迫把它的提案推到大会的最后一项议程。
  世界一半以上人口退出大会
    11月7日下午，会议充满着一种紧张的气氛。会场中可以听到许多关于美国和其他代表团会谈的消息。人们也可以看到美国代表团中一些美国妇女忙碌地在大厅里某些代表团之间来来往往，保持着联络。当主席考尔女士宣布就美国提案举行秘密投票的时候，麦克林托克竟跳到讲坛上，怒气冲冲地要求考尔宣布那些要求举行秘密投票的人的名字，并且蛮横地威胁说“美国代表团对这些人的名字很感兴趣”。但是，在会场的一阵哗笑声中，他被考尔断然斥退了。
    表决的结果并不出人意料。会议在美国操纵下通过了美国的提案。
    投票结果宣布以后，潘自力立即走上讲台，有力地指出美国操纵通过美国的提案是一种卑鄙的行为，并且宣布我国代表团退出大会。以潘自力和李德全为首的中国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团随即走出会场。在走出之前，我国代表团还从座位上取下了写有中国代表团名称的牌子。我国代表团要求大会工作人员取下我国国旗，不让它受到侮辱。
    在街上，记者听到有人在看到我国国旗取下来，并且得知我国代表团已经退出大会的时候，责骂美国是“坏蛋”。当人们看到以考尔女士为首的印度红十字会代表团和苏联代表团接连退出大会会场的时候，他们都怀着深深的同情向这种维护正义和互相支持的精神欢呼。
    十八个国家的二十九个代表团一个接着一个宣布退出大会。大会大厅里陷入混乱不安，只有美国代表团坐在那里假装镇静。有人指出，由于美国的阴谋，超过世界的一半人口退出了大会。
      溜进大厅的小偷
    和这同时，两个蒋介石集团分子一直躲在同一座建筑物里一家餐厅的偏僻角落里，不安地等待着投票的结果。人们不时可以看到有一个美国人走到他们那里，嘁嘁喳喳地把会议厅内的情况告诉他们。在那么多代表团退出以后，就有一个美国人把他们带到大会登记处，随后就把他们带进会议大厅。他们像小偷一样溜进大厅，坐在中国代表团空出的座位上，同时还有一名美国代表也坐到他们背后的座位上监视着他们。这就给人一种非常强烈的印象：他们只是美国掌上的玩物。这两个家伙带着一副可怜相向周围看了一看，竭力避免接触到其他代表注视的眼光。当大批摄影记者聚到周围拍照的时候，他们低下了脑袋，显得无处藏身。
    潘自力在退出大会以后举行了一次记者招待会。他响亮地声明中国绝不能容许任何国际会议上出现“两个中国”的局面，也绝不能承认美国侵占中国的台湾。参加招待会的大批新闻记者全神贯注地听着他的谈话。当麦克林托克听到关于这次记者招待会的消息时，也想表白一下自己，但是结果却只能找到一小撮记者。他用尽一切字眼来诬蔑中国和会议的东道主。他还侮辱考尔女士，他对记者们说考尔女士“恫吓”了美国代表团，甚至无耻地说，“在原则和迷人的公主（指考尔女士）两者之间，我喜欢原则。”
    美国真面目暴露无遗
    国际红十字大会已经闭幕。美国的真正面目已经暴露无遗。但是，同美国代表团的希望相反，六亿中国人民却得到了如此深重的友谊。
    印度有一句古语说：“请也罢，不请也罢，反正我是你的客人。”自从国际红十字大会上发生了这一事件以后，印度首都的人们就纷纷引用这句古语来形容美国所邀请的“客人”。我屡次听印度朋友们说：“今天是‘两个中国’的问题，明天他们也许也要针对着果阿或者克什米尔提出‘两个印度’的问题来。”他们质问说，假如也有人自称是加利福尼亚的代表，而要求参加这次大会，那末美国会说什么呢？
    人们不难从这次大会得出这样的结论：美国本来希望在大会上扮演英雄角色，却终于成为可笑的小丑。狐狸的尾巴还怎么能够藏得住而不叫全世界看见呢？　（新华社新德里9日电）
