Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 11th: The Shandong Province's Third Socialist Agricultural Construction Activists' Representative Conference, lasting eight days, concluded victoriously on the 10th.

Deng Zihui, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Premier of the State Council, and He Jifeng, Vice Minister of Water Resources, attended the conference and gave instructions. Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Tan Qilong, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, gave reports to the conference.

All representatives unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely implement the policy of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and its Third Plenary Session, which calls for vigorously developing agriculture while prioritizing the development of heavy industry. They are prepared to endure ten years of hardship and, with the revolutionary spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, overcome the greatest difficulties and fundamentally change Shandong's natural landscape.

In order to resolve ideological obstacles to the great leap forward in agricultural production, the conference held debates on the following questions raised by Tan Qilong in his report: 1. Should we rely on heaven for food or transform nature? 2. Should we crawl or leap forward? 3. Is there a limit to production, or is production limitless? 4. Should we bow our heads in the face of disaster and hardship, or continue to advance? 5. Does agriculture have a future? Representatives from various regions answered these questions powerfully with numerous vivid examples and personal experiences. The heroic deeds of the Daishan Cooperative in Junan County, which overcame poor mountains and bad waters and comprehensively developed various mountain economies, set an example for all representatives to fight against nature and stabilize production increases. The fact that Huangxian, Shouzhang, and other counties, as well as the Torch Cooperative in Muping County and the Qianjin Cooperative in Dong'a County, increased production by 40%, 50%, or even 70% and 80% within one or two years after collectivization, fully proved that the great leap forward in agricultural production is not only entirely possible but also a characteristic of production development after collectivization. Some representatives originally thought that their local cooperative's production had increased year after year in the past few years, and it seemed impossible to continue to improve in the future. After this debate and listening to some typical speeches, they dispelled the idea of "production reaching its limit." After examining and overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, the representatives, in accordance with the spirit of the conference, re-analyzed and studied their local production conditions, referred to the advanced experiences introduced at the meeting, further explored production potential, and revised their original production increase plans to be more active, practical, and reliable.

In order to quickly launch a large-scale production movement centered on water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and soil improvement after the conference, the representatives issued an open letter to members of agricultural cooperatives throughout the province. At the same time, representatives from various types of regions, such as mountainous areas, plains, sandy wasteland, saline-alkali land, and disaster areas, also submitted proposals to agricultural cooperatives in similar regions and with similar conditions throughout the province, on behalf of their cooperatives, to achieve a great leap forward in production. Xu Jianchun, Hu Zhaokun, and other 81 young activist representatives attending the conference proposed to young people in rural areas throughout the province to become the most active and dynamic shock force in the upcoming production upsurge.

    山东农业建设积极分子代表的宏愿
    根本改变山东自然面貌
    新华社济南11日电　历时八天的山东省第三届社会主义农业建设积极分子代表会议在10日胜利闭幕。
    中共中央委员、国务院副总理邓子恢和水利部副部长何基沣参加了大会并给大会作了指示。中共山东省委第一书记舒同、省委书记处书记谭启龙向大会作了报告。
    全体代表一致表示要坚决贯彻执行中共八届三中全会提出的在优先发展重工业的基础上，同时大力发展农业的方针，准备忍受十年艰苦，以愚公移山的革命劲头战胜最大困难，从根本上改变山东的自然面貌。
    为了解决农业生产大跃进的思想障碍，会议就谭启龙在报告中提出的以下几个问题展开了辩论：一、是靠天吃饭还是改造自然？二、是爬行还是跃进？三、是生产到顶还是生产无止境？四、在灾荒和困难面前低头呢，还是继续前进？五、农业有没有前途？各地代表以无数生动的实例和亲身的体会，有力地回答了这些问题。莒南县大山社介绍的战胜穷山恶水，全面开发山区多种经济的英雄事迹，给全体代表树立了向大自然斗争使生产稳定上升的榜样；黄县、寿张等县和牟平县火炬社、东阿县前进社，在合作化以后的一两年内增产40％、50％以至70％、80％的事实，充分证明了实现农业生产的跃进不仅是完全可能的，而且是合作化以后生产发展的特点。有些代表原来以为本地本社的生产在过去几年中连年有所增长，今后继续提高似乎不可能了；经过这次辩论和听了一些典型发言以后，把“增产到顶”的思想打消了。代表们在检查、克服右倾保守思想以后，纷纷根据会议的精神，重新分析研究了本地的生产条件，参照会上介绍的先进经验，进一步深入挖掘生产潜力，把原来的增产计划修订得更加积极而又切实可靠。
    为了在会后迅速展开以兴修水利、积肥、改良土壤为中心的大生产运动，到会代表向全省农业社社员发出一封公开信。同时，来自山区、平原、沙荒、盐碱和灾区等各种类型地区的代表们，还分别代表他们的合作社向全省同类地区、同样条件的农业社，提出了实现生产大跃进的倡议书。出席这次会议的徐建春、胡兆坤等八十一名青年积极分子代表，向全省农村青年提出倡议，要在即将到来的生产高潮中，成为一支最积极最活跃的突击力量。
