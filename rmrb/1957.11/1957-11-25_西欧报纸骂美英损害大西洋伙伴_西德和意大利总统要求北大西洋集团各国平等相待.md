Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: According to TASS: Western European newspapers continue to comment on the intensification of internal contradictions within the North Atlantic Group caused by the U.S. and Britain's efforts to tighten control over other member states of the North Atlantic Group.

British newspapers emphasize the intensification of contradictions among the countries of the North Atlantic Group, particularly between the U.S. and Britain and France. The "Manchester Guardian" writes: The French "see the events in Tunisia as a conspiracy to seize the oil of the Sahara, or as a tactic, as a step by Britain and the U.S. to establish dominance within the Atlantic Alliance."

The French newspaper "Liberation," under the title "The Contradiction Between Europeans and Anglo-Saxons is Developing," published an article discussing the intensification of the North Atlantic Group crisis. The newspaper points out that the reason for this crisis is "mainly that the people and governments of Western European countries are increasingly afraid of the escalating arms race of weapons of mass destruction, and the United States is increasingly blatantly regarding itself as the host of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and attempting to obtain the right to decide on the issue of launching rocket and hydrogen bomb wars." The newspaper says that America's allies are afraid of America and no longer believe in America's "leadership."

West German newspapers, in response to the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council, emphasized that the plan to intensify atomic armament has caused serious divisions within the North Atlantic Group. The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" also reported on the "French plan" that opposes the British and American plans. The newspaper pointed out that the French plan stipulates that "countries participating in the European Coal and Steel Community should unite more closely militarily." The purpose of this plan is: not to allow France to be relegated to a secondary position, but to make France on par with other countries in the North Atlantic Group, including West Germany. According to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung," the Bonn Foreign Ministry believes that the French plan is to establish a unique "continental European front" to counter the plans of the U.S. and Britain. The "Stuttgarter Zeitung" also pointed out that Western European countries are under great threat. The United States' request to establish rocket bases on the European continent primarily concerns West Germany. The article continues: From the time West Germany "becomes a Western rocket base, German reunification will no longer be possible."

Xinhua News Agency, November 24th, Rome: West German President Heuss and Italian President Gronchi issued a joint communiqué on the 22nd, stating that the North Atlantic Group must be built on the basis of equality among member states, "thereby establishing a joint political leadership within the treaty."

This communiqué was issued after Heuss's four-day state visit to Rome.

    西欧报纸骂美英损害大西洋伙伴
    西德和意大利总统要求北大西洋集团各国平等相待
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社讯：西欧各国报纸继续评论美英两国由于要加紧控制北大西洋集团其他成员国而引起的北大西洋集团内部矛盾的尖锐化。
    英国报纸着重指出北大西洋集团各国之间、特别是美英两国同法国之间矛盾的尖锐化。“曼彻斯特卫报”写道：法国人“把突尼斯的事件看作是想要攫取撒哈拉石油的阴谋，或者看作是一种手腕，看作是英美要在大西洋联盟内建立统治权的步骤。”
    法国的“解放报”以“欧洲人和盎格鲁撒克逊人之间的矛盾在发展中”为题发表一篇文章，论述北大西洋集团危机尖锐化。报纸指出发生这种危机的原因“主要是西欧各国人民和政府越来越害怕大规模毁灭性武器的军备竞赛变本加厉，而美国越来越露骨地把自己看作是北大西洋公约组织的东道主，并且企图取得发动火箭和氢弹战争问题的决定权”。报纸说，美国的同盟国害怕美国，不再相信美国的“领导”。
    西德报纸针对着即将举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议，强调指出北大西洋集团内部由于加紧原子军备的计划而引起了严重分歧。“法兰克福总汇报”还报道了同英美计划相对立的“法国计划”。报纸指出，法国计划规定“参加欧洲煤钢联营的国家在军事上更加紧密的团结起来”。这个计划的目的在于：不容许把法国排挤到次要地位去，而要使法国同北大西洋集团其他各国，包括西德在内，并驾齐驱。据“南德意志报”消息，波恩外交部认为法国的计划是要建立独特的“欧洲大陆阵线”来对抗美英两国的计划。“斯图加特日报”并指出：西欧国家正受着极大的威胁。美国提出在欧洲大陆建立火箭基地的要求首先关系到西德。文章接着说：从西德“变成西方火箭基地时起，德国统一就再也谈不上了。”
    据新华社24日讯　罗马消息：西德总统豪斯和意大利总统格隆基22日发表联合公报说，北大西洋集团必须建立在各成员国平等的基础之上，“从而在条约之内建立一个联合政治领导”。
    这项公报是豪斯在罗马进行了四天国事访问后发表的。
