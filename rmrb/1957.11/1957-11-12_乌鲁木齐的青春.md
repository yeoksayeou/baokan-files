    The Youth of Ürümqi
    Hao Jian

    Ürümqi, this city located on China's northwestern border, is undergoing rapid changes from its old appearance. Just look down on the city, and you will see a thriving construction scene. The capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region leans on the majestic Tianshan Mountains to the south and connects to the vast Junggar Basin in the north. The magnificent Ürümqi River flows from south to north through the city. On both banks of the river stand newly built factories and brand-new buildings. All the main streets of the city have been renovated into flat and tidy asphalt roads, with rows of slender poplars planted along both sides. The prosperous city center is bustling with activity, with people of all ethnic groups wearing colorful costumes and speaking various ethnic languages. At night, the whole city is lit up, and the joyful ethnic songs are intoxicating. If someone revisits the city and recalls the scene of Ürümqi before liberation, he will feel how much the city has changed. Before liberation, every time the spring snow melted, the streets were muddy, and in the summer, dust flew everywhere. At night, fewer than two thousand electric lights in the city emitted a dim light. "Dim lights, uneven roads, unreliable telephones" was the epitome of old Ürümqi.

    Now, tens of thousands of people of all ethnic groups are building Ürümqi with selfless labor.

    Before liberation, Ürümqi had virtually no industrial construction. In two hundred years, only six semi-handicraft factories producing ceramics, soap, and matches were established, and the machinery and equipment were also very old. After liberation, thanks to massive national investment and selfless Soviet assistance, more than thirty modern factories and mines have now been established, including steel, textile, agricultural machinery, automobile repair, cement, electricity, coal mining, printing and dyeing, and flour. According to statistics, the city's total industrial output value in 1956 increased by 130 times compared with 1949, and the total number of workers of all ethnic groups also increased from more than 400 in 1949 to more than 20,000. After these factories and mines were built, they played a significant role in supporting the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and industrial construction in Xinjiang.

    Ürümqi's cultural and educational undertakings are also advancing by leaps and bounds. Taking higher education as an example, in the past there was only one Xinjiang College, with fewer than 400 students. Now, not only has Xinjiang College been expanded, but four higher education institutions have also been established: Xinjiang Medical College, August 1st Agricultural College, Xinjiang Language College, and Xinjiang Normal College, with a total of four to five thousand students. Among them, the newly built Xinjiang Medical College in the western suburbs last year is well-equipped and large-scale, with a construction area of approximately 100,000 square meters. The people proudly call it "Xinjiang's Medical City." In order to train a large number of middle-level technical cadres, the Autonomous Region has also established more than ten secondary specialized schools for geology, petroleum, mining, agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, and health. Ürümqi now has twelve theaters and cinemas, eight of which were built after liberation. The People's Theater, which was completed in the city center this year, is a large-scale building with a strong national style and can accommodate 1,200 spectators. People living in Ürümqi can enjoy Peking opera, Ping opera, Qin opera, and rich and colorful folk song and dance.

    Ürümqi is a city with a population of more than 200,000, where people of thirteen ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, and Han, live. In the past, due to the instigation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the estrangement between ethnic groups was very deep. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the estrangement between people of all ethnic groups gradually disappeared, and they respected each other's customs, helped each other, learned from each other, and worked together.

    Ürümqi has infinitely broad prospects for development. It has now been found that there is a rich coalfield underground in Ürümqi, and the hills surrounding the city also contain many kinds of minerals. The Lanzhou-Ürümqi-Aktogay railway will be completed before long. At that time, the young Ürümqi will be even more prosperous. (Attached photo)

    Guangming Road in Ürümqi, a few years ago, this could only be regarded as the suburbs of Ürümqi, a vegetable garden. Now, both sides of the wide asphalt road with street gardens are lined with tall buildings.

    乌鲁木齐的青春
    郝健
    乌鲁木齐，这座位于我国西北边陲的城市，正在日新月异地改变着旧日的面貌。只要你俯瞰市区，就会看到一幅欣欣向荣的建设景象。这新疆维吾尔自治区的首府，南依巍峨雄伟的天山，北连浩瀚无垠的准噶尔盆地，壮阔的乌鲁木齐河由南向北穿过市区。河的两岸，矗立着新建的工厂和崭新的楼房。全市各主要街道都已经翻修成平坦整洁的柏油马路，马路两旁种植了一排排秀挺的白杨。繁荣的市中心区热闹非凡，穿着各民族鲜艳服装、操着各民族语言的行人络绎不绝。入夜，全市一片灯火，欢乐的民族歌曲，使人为之陶醉。如果有人旧地重游，回忆起乌鲁木齐解放前的情景，他会感到这座城市起了多大的变化。解放前，每当春雪融化，街道泥泞，入夏又是到处尘土飞扬。夜间，全市不满二千盏电灯发出暗淡的微光。“电灯不明，马路不平，电话不灵”，就是旧乌鲁木齐的写照。
    现在，成千上万的各族人民，正以忘我的劳动建设着乌鲁木齐。
    解放以前，乌鲁木齐谈不上什么工业建设，二百年来仅建立了六个生产陶瓷、肥皂和火柴等产品的半手工业性质的工厂，机器设备也很陈旧。解放以后，由于国家大量的投资和苏联无私的援助，现在已经建立起钢铁、纺织、农业机器、汽车修配、水泥、电力、煤矿、印染和面粉等三十多个现代化的厂矿。据统计，全市工业生产总值1956年比1949年增加了一百三十倍，各族工人的总数，也由1949年的四百多人增加到两万多人。这些厂矿建成以后，对支援新疆农、牧业的发展和工业建设的需要都起了很大的作用。
    乌鲁木齐的文化教育事业也在突飞猛进。仅以高等学校来说，过去只有一所新疆学院，学生不满四百人。现在不但扩建了新疆学院，而且还成立了新疆医学院、八一农学院、新疆语文学院、新疆师范学院等四所高等学校，学生已达四、五千人。其中去年在西郊新建成的新疆医学院，设备完善，规模宏大，建筑面积约达十万平方公尺，人民骄傲地把它称为“新疆的医学城”。自治区为了培养大批的中等技术干部，还先后成立了地质、石油、矿业、农林、水利和卫生等十余处中等专业学校。乌鲁木齐现在共有十二处剧院和电影院，其中有八处是解放后建成的。今年在市中心落成的人民剧场，就是一座规模宏大而富有民族风格的建筑物，全场可容纳观众一千二百人。生活在乌鲁木齐的人们，可以欣赏京剧、评剧、秦腔和丰富多采的民间歌舞。
    乌鲁木齐是一个拥有二十多万人口的城市，在这里居住着维吾尔、哈萨克、回、汉等十三个民族的人民。过去由于国民党反动派的挑拨离间，各民族之间的隔阂很深。解放以后，在党和人民政府的领导下，各族人民间的隔阂逐渐消除，彼此互相尊重风俗习惯，互相帮助，互相学习，共同劳动。
    乌鲁木齐有着无限广阔的发展前途。现在已经查明，在乌鲁木齐市的地下，就是一个丰富的大煤田，环绕在市区附近的丘陵中，也蕴藏着许多种矿产。兰州——乌鲁木齐——阿克斗卡铁路不用很久也要修通了。到那时候，年轻的乌鲁木齐将会更加繁荣。（附图片）
    乌鲁木齐的光明路，几年以前，这里还只能算是乌鲁木齐的市郊，是一片菜园。现在，宽阔的有着街心花园的柏油大道两旁已经摆满了高大的楼房。
