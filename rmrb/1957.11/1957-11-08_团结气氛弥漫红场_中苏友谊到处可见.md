    Moscow, November 7 (By our correspondent) - A grand military parade and mass procession were held in Red Square today. At this celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, people were once again deeply moved by the great unity of socialist countries and the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Although Beijing is far from Moscow, in addition to the Chinese delegation, there were also the Labor People's Delegation, the Military Friendship Delegation to the Soviet Union, the Scientific and Technological Delegation to the Soviet Union, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences Delegation attending the ceremony. When Chairman Mao, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, Comrade Khrushchev, Comrade Bulganin, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping, along with members of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and leaders of fraternal parties from various countries, ascended the reviewing stand of the Lenin and Stalin Mausoleum, tens of thousands of people cast respectful and affectionate glances at them. When the marching column passed in front of the reviewing stand, a group of innocent children ran up to the reviewing stand to present flowers to them, and hundreds of thousands of Moscow workers waved and cheered enthusiastically. Chairman Mao, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping also waved and nodded to the marching masses, along with the Soviet and other fraternal party leaders. When the marching column passed in front of the Chinese delegation and other Chinese delegations, they enthusiastically waved and cheered towards the Chinese comrades on the reviewing stand and the grandstand, and shouted slogans such as "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!" "The Chinese and Soviet peoples are brothers!" Many people in the marching column also took photos as souvenirs while passing in front of the Chinese comrades. Chairman Mao, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, Comrade Deng Xiaoping on the reviewing stand, as well as all members of the Chinese delegation and members of other Chinese delegations on the grandstand, also constantly waved and cheered to the dear Soviet comrades. Red Square was filled with an atmosphere of boundless joy and fraternal love.
    After the review, when Chairman Mao, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping came down from the reviewing stand, people immediately surrounded them, jumping and cheering. On the way back to their residences after the ceremony, members of other Chinese delegations were constantly stopped by Soviet comrades, who repeatedly shook hands tightly and embraced warmly, some busily taking photos to capture this moving scene. All this fully demonstrates how deep the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is.

    团结气氛弥漫红场  中苏友谊到处可见
    本报莫斯科7日电　今天红场举行了盛大的阅兵和群众游行。在这个庆祝十月革命四十周年的典礼上，人们又一次深深地被社会主义国家的伟大的团结和中苏两国人民的伟大友谊所感动。北京虽然离莫斯科很远，但是这次前来参加典礼的除了中国代表团以外，还有劳动人民代表团、军事友好访苏代表团、访苏科学技术代表团和中国科学院代表团等。当毛主席、宋庆龄副委员长随着赫鲁晓夫同志、布尔加宁同志，邓小平同志随着苏共中央主席团委员和各国兄弟党的领导人员登上列宁斯大林陵墓的检阅台的时候，成千成万的人民向他们投着尊敬和爱戴的眼光。当游行队伍经过检阅台前面的时候，一队天真的儿童跑上检阅台向他们献花，几十万莫斯科劳动者向他们热烈地招手欢呼。毛主席、宋庆龄副委员长和邓小平同志也和苏联及其他兄弟党领导人员向游行群众招手、点头。当游行队伍经过中国代表团和中国其他代表团的前面的时候，都向检阅台和观礼台上的中国同志们热烈地招手欢呼，并且高喊：“苏中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！”“苏中两国人民是兄弟！”等口号。游行队伍中还有很多人在通过中国同志前面的时候，拍照留念。在检阅台上的毛主席、宋庆龄副委员长、邓小平同志以及在观礼台上的中国代表团的全体团员和中国其他代表团的团员们，也不断向亲爱的苏联同志们招手、欢呼。红场上洋溢着无限欢愉和兄弟友爱的气氛。
    检阅完毕，毛主席、宋庆龄副委员长、邓小平同志从检阅台下来的时候，人们立刻把他们包围起来，跳跃、欢呼。中国其他代表团的团员在观礼完毕返回住所的路上，不断被苏联同志们拦住，一再紧紧地握手，热烈地拥抱，有的忙着照像，把这种动人的场面拍下来。这一切都充分地显示出中苏两国人民的友谊是多么深厚。
