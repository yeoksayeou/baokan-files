Xinhua News Agency, Vancouver, 19th Dispatch: According to a recent report in the "Pacific Tribune," representatives attending the British Columbia Federation of Labour convention in Canada unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Canadian government recognize China, advocating for the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, and the establishment of trade relations with China.

    During the conference proceedings, many representatives expressed the aforementioned demands. Jacobs, a representative of the seamen, said that when we discuss the unemployment problems of Canadian workers, we are forgetting the major fact of a market with 600 million people. He said that trade with China means increasing the number of jobs for Canadians.

    Hobbs, a representative of the train drivers, pointed out that non-recognition of China is a self-deceiving ostrich policy.

    加拿大工人要求中加建交
    认为不承认中国是鸵鸟政策
    据新华社19日讯　温哥华消息：据最近“太平洋论坛报”报道，出席加拿大英属哥伦比亚总工会会议的代表一致通过一项决议，要求加拿大政府承认中国，主张恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位以及同中国建立贸易关系。
    在会议进程中，许多代表都表达了上述要求。海员的代表雅各布斯说，当我们讨论加拿大工人的失业问题的时候，我们忘掉了一个有六亿人民的市场这样一个重大事实。他说，和中国贸易意味着增加加拿大人的就业数目。
    火车司机的代表霍布斯指出，不承认中国是自欺欺人的鸵鸟政策。
