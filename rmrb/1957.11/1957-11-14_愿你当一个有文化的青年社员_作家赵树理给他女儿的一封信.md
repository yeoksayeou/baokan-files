Wishing You to Be a Cultured Young Commune Member
——A Letter from Writer Zhao Shuli to His Daughter
Editor's Note: This article was originally published in the Shanxi Daily on the 11th. According to the editor's note of the Shanxi Daily: Comrade Zhao Shuli's daughter has decided to settle down in the countryside. She said: "Now I am determined to return to my hometown to be a cultured young commune member. There are my childhood friends, the mountains where I used to pick up sheep manure, and the river where I used to wash clothes. How much I long to work on that familiar land!"

Guangjian:
It has been many days since your last letter. I wonder what progress you have made recently.

You have been out of school for a year now. In this year, you have changed three jobs and finally "approached" the working people. I think that under the current conditions, your thinking should have developed somewhat, so I would like to analyze your life and thoughts over the past year as a reference for you to adjust your life in the future.

Last year, you wanted to go to Xinjiang, and I agreed. In the process of discussing this matter, you rejected many of my suggestions: I wanted you to return to your hometown to join an agricultural cooperative, which you were unwilling to consider at all; I asked you to engage in service industries in Beijing, and specifically suggested positions such as ticket seller, salesperson, and barber. You playfully said that you would only sell tickets and goods to your father, and only cut your father's hair, but in reality, you were fundamentally unwilling to consider it.

Judging from this incident, I said at the time that you looked down on the working people, and you disagreed. Now I think you should be able to recognize this point! Of course, your feelings at the time were complicated, but no matter how complicated, the guiding ideology was only one: "looking down on the working people." You had two small burdens: one was being a high school student, and the other was being the child of a cadre. From the old society came some social occupational evaluations that considered that those who had studied or were cadres should be superior to others, and that those who participated in production and service industries were doing rough work and were vulgar. This old view, which is extremely incompatible with socialism, secretly spread to the minds of many students and children of cadres, and you were unfortunately one of the people who accepted this bad legacy. I believe your mind is not too dull. Learning to sell tickets or goods wouldn't be so difficult that you couldn't count the money properly, and learning to cut hair wouldn't lead to cutting off customers' ears. The reason why you were unwilling to do it was because you were afraid of running into your teachers, classmates, or my old colleagues; if you returned to your hometown to participate in agricultural production, you would be much better than urban youths who had never seen crops. The reason why you were unwilling to go was also because you were afraid that relatives and young friends would also say you were "unpromising" based on the undesirable old views. The children of the working people accept the issue of employment in production much better than the children of cadres—although they have also accepted the old views on occupational evaluation, when they really can't find a so-called "higher occupation" or can't go to college, the children of farmers will naturally go to farm, and the children of barbers will naturally learn to cut hair. Even if they don't really understand it ideologically, they will really do it in action; even if they are a little dissatisfied, they won't think it's shameful. But the children of cadres often can't be so open-minded, always thinking that if their father is a cadre, the son can't be a barber. But what's wrong with that? I am a writer and you are a barber. When my hair grows long, I ask you to cut it, and I write novels for you to read. Isn't that a reasonable social division of labor? Every high school graduate not only understands the principle of equality but can also talk about it, and the children of cadres can talk about it even more comprehensively, but when they are asked to choose a career as a lifelong profession, they often refuse to choose the labor production that the vast majority of people participate in. What other explanation can there be for this other than "looking down on the working people"?

After returning from Xinjiang with illness, I still encouraged you to participate in agricultural cooperatives for direct production, whether you returned to your hometown or went to Yongji. You said it was "unrealistic." What you meant by "unrealistic" seemed to refer to your weak body and lack of exercise. This reason is untenable. In any labor production organization, the physical conditions of the members are not perfectly balanced. Everyone has some differences in strength and weakness, so the work assigned to each person and the remuneration they receive are also different. In every agricultural cooperative, in every factory, there are people with the same or weaker physical strength than you. They are all realistically participating in production. As for not having exercise, that is only a matter of time. Joining in is the beginning of exercise. Can this still be a reason for not participating in production?

My brother and I later agreed to let you find work other than production in Yongji because we couldn't convince you and were temporarily accommodating you. In fact, you are not suitable to be a cadre. Cadres are the backbone of the masses. Cadres must be stronger than the masses and must have the training of production struggles and class struggles. Chairman Mao said that there are only two kinds of knowledge in the world: one is the knowledge of production struggle, and the other is the knowledge of class struggle. You and the average high school student happen to lack these two kinds of knowledge, so you are not suitable to be cadres. You said in your last letter that your current task is to mobilize graduates to participate in production, but you yourself are the object that should be mobilized. Doesn't that become material for Hou Baolin's crosstalk?

I believe that in these few months of rural work, you have met many working people, understood some things about production, and should have moved closer to the working people in terms of emotion. But I think you should further settle down in a cooperative and become a cultured young commune member. Only by truly participating in production and living on work points can you deeply understand what stage our socialist construction is in now and how to move forward on the existing basis. Only then can you deeply understand that any problem in production is directly related to yourself—that is, directly related to the broad masses. As long as you truly make achievements in production, you will feel that production itself is joyful.

I heard from your classmates that you have written several articles recently (I haven't inquired about the content). I don't object, but I don't dare to rashly encourage you. I have loved literature and art since I was in my twenties and have also practiced it, but I didn't start writing seriously until after I was thirty-eight. You can write in your spare time. Most of the future writers will still come from amateur writers, but you must recognize what is "professional" and what is "amateur." The love for your profession should exceed the love for writing many times. You know that I also love to play the flute, and I play it very badly; I don't stop playing because I don't play well, but I will never strive to perform a solo on stage (at home I can only "solo" naturally). This is called amateur. Amateur art lovers should have this attitude towards writing—if you write well, you can naturally publish it, and if it's particularly good, you can also change your profession, just like if I play the flute well, I can also perform on stage or join an orchestra. Many young intellectuals who join agricultural cooperatives write to me saying that they are determined to become writers, and I disagree. Agricultural cooperatives can produce writers, but putting being a writer first makes production "amateur." If there are too many people participating in the agricultural cooperative like this, it may turn the cooperative into a small writers' association, but it is not easy to turn the cooperative into a model cooperative.

I won't write anymore! I hope you participate in production and focus your main interest on your main business.

Father, September 14th

### 愿你当一个有文化的青年社员——作家赵树理给他女儿的一封信

    愿你当一个有文化的青年社员
    ——作家赵树理给他女儿的一封信
    编者按：本文原载11日山西日报。据山西日报编者按：赵树理同志的女儿已经决定到农村去落户了，她说：“现在我决心回到家乡当一个有文化的青年社员，那里有我小时候的朋友，有我曾经拾过羊粪的山，有我曾经洗过衣服的河，我多么渴望在那熟悉的土地上劳动啊！”广建：
    多日不见你的来信，不知近来有何进步。
    你离开学校已经一年了。在这一年中，你换了三个工作岗位，最后总算“接近”了劳动人民。我想在现在的条件下，你的思想应该有所开展，因而我又想对你一年来的生活、思想情况作一点分析，作为你今后调整生活的参考。
    去年你要到新疆，我同意了。在商量这件事的过程中，你驳回了我好多建议：我要你回原籍参加农业社，你根本不愿考虑；我让你在北京参加服务业，并具体提出当售票员、售货员、理发员等职务，你调皮地说售票、售货只售给爸爸，理发也只给爸爸理，其实自然还是根本不愿考虑。
    从这一件事看来，当时我说你是看不起劳动人民，你不服气，现在我想你应该能够认识这一点了吧！自然你当时的心情是复杂的，不过不论如何复杂，其主导思想只是一种，那就是“看不起劳动人民”。你有两个小小包袱：一个是高中学生，另一个是干部子弟。从旧社会传来一些社会职业评价，认为读了书或当了干部就应该高人一等，认为参加生产和服务业的人是干粗活的、俗人。这种与社会主义极不相容的旧观点，偷偷地流传到很多学生和干部子弟的头脑中，而你不幸也是接受了这份坏遗产的一个人。我相信你的头脑不太笨，学售票或售货还不至于连钱钞也查点不清，学理发也不至于削了顾客的耳朵，而你所以不愿干者是怕碰上你的老师、同学或和我同事的老前辈；要是回原籍参加农业生产，你也要比从来没有见过庄稼的城市青年好得多，而你所以不愿去者，也是怕亲戚们和小朋友们也从要不得的旧观点出发，说你一声“没出息”。同样的中学生，在生产就业问题上，劳动人民的子女们要比干部子弟好接受得多——他们尽管也接受过对职业评价的旧观点，可是一到了真找不到所谓“高等职业”或升不了学的时候，农民的子女很自然地会去种地，理发师的子女很自然地会去学理发，即使思想上没有真通了，在行动上也会真做了；即使有点不满，也不至于认为见不得人。而干部子弟则往往不能那样开朗，总以为爸爸当干部儿子就不能理发，其实那有什么坏处呢？我当作家你理发，我的头发长了请你理，我写出小说来供你读，难道不是合理的社会分工吗？平等的道理，每一个中学毕业生不但能懂而且会说，干部子弟说得更会周全些，只是要让他们选择一种事业作为终身业务，他们往往偏不选择最大多数人参加的劳动生产，这除了说是“看不起劳动人民”还能再有什么解释呢？
    从新疆带病回来以后，我仍动员你不论回原籍、不论到永济，最好是参加农业社直接生产，你说那是“不现实的”。你所谓“不现实”，似乎是指你的身体不强，又缺乏锻炼，这理由是站不住的，任何劳动生产的组织中，成员们的体力条件都不是非常平衡的，每个人都有一些强弱的差别，因而每人分到的工作和应得的报酬也都有差别。每个农业社中，每个工厂中，都有体力和你相等和比你还弱的人，他们都很现实地参加在生产之中；至于没有锻炼，那只是时间问题，参加进去就是锻炼的开始，这难道还能成为什么不应参加生产的理由吗？
    我和你哥哥后来答应你到永济找生产以外的工作，都是说不服你暂时对你的迁就，实际上你是不能当干部的。干部者，群众之骨干也。干部一定要比群众坚强，要有生产斗争和阶级斗争的锻炼。毛主席说过，世界的知识只有两门，一门是生产斗争知识，一门是阶级斗争知识。你和一般中学生都恰巧是缺这两门知识，所以都不适宜于当干部。你前次来信说你现在的任务是动员毕业生参加生产，而你自己却正是应该被动员的对象，难道不成了侯宝林说相声的材料了吗？
    我相信你在这几个月农村工作中认识了好多劳动人民，懂得了一些生产中的事情，而在感情方面也应该更向劳动人民靠近一些，但我以为应该进一步在一个社里落户，当一个有文化的青年社员。只有真正参加了生产，凭工分过日子，才能深刻体会到我们的社会主义生产建设现在是个什么阶段，在现有的基础上如何前进，才能深刻体会到生产中任何问题都与自己有直接关系——即与广大群众有直接关系。只要你在生产中真有所建树，你是会感到生产本身就有快乐的。
    听你的同学说，你近来写了几篇文章（内容我没有打听），我不反对，但也不敢冒然鼓励。我是从二十多岁起就爱好文艺，而且也练习过，但认真地写还是三十八岁以后的事。业余可以写作，今后的作家大部分仍会从业余中产生，但一定要认识什么是“业”什么是
  “余”，爱业务的精神应该超过爱写作的精神好多倍。你知道我也爱吹笛子，而且吹得很别脚；我不因为吹得不好而不吹，但也永远不争取登台独奏（在家自然只能“独奏”）。这就叫业余。业余的文艺爱好者对写作应抱这种态度——写得好了自然也可以发表，特殊好了也可以转业，也像我的笛子假如吹好了也可以登台演奏或参加乐队一样。有好多参加农业社的青年知识分子给我来信说，他们立志要当个作家，我不同意。农业社可以产生作家，只是把当作家放在第一位，而生产就成了“业余”。农业社参加的这种人多了，也许会把社变成了小的作家协会，只是不容易把社办成个模范社。
    不写了！希望你参加生产，把主要兴趣放在主要业务上。
                      父示　9月14日
