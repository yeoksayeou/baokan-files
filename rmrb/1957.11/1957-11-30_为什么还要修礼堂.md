    Why Are We Still Building Auditoriums?
    Recently, some units in Tangshan City have been extensively renovating auditoriums. The Kailuan Coal Mine originally had two auditoriums in Tangshan City, one capable of holding seven or eight hundred people, and another capable of holding over a thousand people. However, recently, the Kailuan Coal Mine demolished the auditorium that could hold seven or eight hundred people and rebuilt a large auditorium capable of holding over a thousand people. The Tangshan Rolling Stock Repair Factory originally had a large auditorium capable of holding over a thousand people, and now it is building another large auditorium two hundred meters away from this auditorium.
    The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly called on the people of the whole country to build the country with diligence and thrift, run enterprises with diligence and thrift, and run all undertakings with diligence and thrift. Vice Premier Bo Yibo also publicly instructed not long ago that no unnecessary non-productive buildings such as large auditoriums and guesthouses should be built in 1958.
    There are ten or twenty large auditoriums in Tangshan City that can hold around a thousand people. Almost every major factory and mine has one, and many small and medium-sized enterprises have them too. The utilization rate is generally very low. Why are we still continuing to build them?

### 为什么还要修礼堂

    为什么还要修礼堂
    最近，唐山市有的单位在大修礼堂。开滦煤矿在唐山市原来有两个礼堂，一个能容纳七、八百人，一个能容一千多人。但是最近开滦煤矿却把那个能容七、八百人的礼堂拆掉了，重修一个能容纳一千多人的大礼堂。唐山机车车辆修理工厂原有一个能容一千多人的大礼堂，现在又在距离这个礼堂二百多公尺的地方修建一个大礼堂。
    党中央和毛主席曾一再号召全国人民要勤俭建国，勤俭办企业，勤俭办一切事业。薄一波副总理也曾在不久以前公开指示过，1958年内一律不建大礼堂、招待所等不必要的非生产性建筑。
    唐山市能容一千人左右的大礼堂有一、二十个。各大厂矿差不多每家一个，中小企业也有不少，利用率普遍很低，为什么还要继续盖呢？　唐山市建设局　李汉
