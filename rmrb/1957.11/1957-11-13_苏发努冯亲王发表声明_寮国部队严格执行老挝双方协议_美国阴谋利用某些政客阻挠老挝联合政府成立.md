Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th – Vientiane dispatch: Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, issued a statement on the 11th, guaranteeing that the Lao Fighting Units will unanimously, strictly, and fully implement all the provisions of the agreement reached between the two Lao sides on the establishment of a coalition government and other issues.

The statement reiterated the Lao Fighting Units' willingness to cooperate loyally and sincerely with the Royal Government. The statement concluded by expressing firm belief that all Lao people will unite around King Sisavang Vong and the Royal Government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma to thoroughly implement the national policy of unification, neutrality, and peace.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th – According to a report by Agence France-Presse from Vientiane, certain political leaders in Laos, supported by the United States, are conspiring to obstruct the establishment of a Lao coalition government.

Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Royal Government of Laos, and Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, issued a joint statement on November 2nd, agreeing to establish a coalition government with representatives from the Lao Fighting Units participating. The Lao public is closely watching the implementation of this joint statement. Agence France-Presse said that at the time of signing this joint statement, "what impressed observers was, on the one hand, the spirit of reconciliation shown by the Lao representatives, and on the other hand, the unexpectedly sudden disappearance of all public opposition from those political leaders who, with strong U.S. support, held an attitude of distrust towards Laos."

Agence France-Presse continued, however, "obstacles have not been completely eliminated." They believe that "although the opposition 'can no longer go against the tide,' activities will soon be carried out to try to prevent the organization of a new government, especially to carry out activities on the issue of the distribution of ministerial positions, with the aim of creating a government crisis or worsening the situation." These sources emphasized that this is a continuation of the kind of activity that prevented Prince Souvanna Phouma from forming a new government when it was expected to be resolved immediately on November 1st and 2nd.

When discussing the Lao leaders who oppose the Lao Fighting Units, Agence France-Presse focused on the Lao Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Independent Party, Sananikone.

    苏发努冯亲王发表声明
    寮国部队严格执行老挝双方协议
    美国阴谋利用某些政客阻挠老挝联合政府成立
    新华社河内12日电　万象消息：寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯在11日发表一项声明，声明保证寮国战斗部队将全体一致地、严格地、全面地执行老挝双方就成立联合政府等问题达成的协议中的全部条款。
    声明再次申明寮国战斗部队愿意同王国政府忠诚真挚地进行合作。声明最后表示坚信全体老挝人民将团结在西萨旺·冯国王和以富马亲王为首的王国政府的周围，来把统一、中立与和平的民族政策贯彻到底。
    新华社12日讯　据法新社万象消息透露，美国支持下的老挝的某些政界领袖正在阴谋阻挠老挝联合政府的成立。
    老挝王国政府首相富马亲王和寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王已经在11月2日发表联合声明，同意成立有寮国战斗部队代表参加的联合政府。老挝公众正在关心地注视着这个联合声明的执行问题。法新社说，在签订这个联合声明的时候，“使得观察家印象深刻的，一方面是寮国代表表现出和解精神，另一方面是在美国的有力支持下抱着对寮国不信任态度的那些政界领袖的一切公开反对都出乎意外地突然消失了。”
    法新社接着说，但是，通常消息灵通人士说，“障碍并未完全消除”。他们认为，“反对派虽然‘再也不能逆流而行’，但是即将进行活动来试图阻止组织新政府，尤其是要在大臣职位分配问题上进行活动，其目的是造成政府危机，或者使形势恶化。”这些人士强调指出，这就是使得富马亲王在11月1日到2日可望立即解决问题的时候未能组成新政府的那种活动的继续。
    法新社在谈到反对寮国战斗部队的老挝领袖人物时，着重谈到了老挝外交大臣、独立党主席萨纳尼空。
