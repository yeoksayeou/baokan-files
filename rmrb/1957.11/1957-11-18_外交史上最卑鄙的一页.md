The Most Despicable Page in Diplomatic History
By a commentator of this newspaper

    The Indian magazine "Blitz" recently published another secret document lost by the U.S. Embassy in Taipei. It is a telegram instruction from the U.S. State Department to U.S. embassies in various Asian countries on March 21 regarding the results of the Manila Treaty's Canberra Conference. This document, like the telegram from U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Allison, to the State Department, thoroughly exposes the extremely insidious colonialist aggression activities carried out by the United States in Asian countries. People see that the main task prescribed by the U.S. State Department to its diplomats is how to interfere with, control, and enslave the countries where they are stationed.

    The document shows that U.S. diplomats not only carry out subversive activities against Asian countries that pursue a policy of peace and neutrality, but also use various despicable means to manipulate the fate of the Asian member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, placing them in a completely subordinate position. These facts most clearly prove that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a tool of American colonialism.

    The United States often propagates that the purpose of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is to protect the "independence" and "freedom" of its member states. However, the State Department's document exposes this hypocritical face. It turns out that, in the eyes of the U.S. State Department, the sacred duty of a "free" country's rulers is not to be loyal to their country, but to be loyal to the United States! The State Department instructed its diplomats in Asian countries: "Efforts must continue to impress upon those in power that their position is directly dependent on their loyalty to the United States." Therefore, if the rulers of these countries do not suit the United States, then their position will be in danger, because the United States will come out to support those who "show an understanding of the tasks facing the free world (read as the United States)." Similarly, if the political situation in these countries develops in a direction that does not suit the United States, then the U.S. Embassy and "people engaged in special missions" will also come out to "stop" it. This is the "independence" and "freedom" that the United States wants to protect!

    However, political interference alone is not enough. The U.S. monopoly groups understand that to completely control a country, its army cannot be ignored. Therefore, the State Department's document states: "Control of the armed forces of the Asian members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization remains our primary objective." In order to accomplish this task, the State Department instructed its diplomats to strengthen the military nature of "aid" to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries, while greatly reducing economic assistance, and "must spare no effort to break down the hesitation of local governments on the issue of establishing joint armed forces and joint commands of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." From this, it can be seen that the U.S.'s "military assistance" and "joint armed forces" are all means and methods, the purpose of which is only to strengthen U.S. military control and domination over these Asian countries.

    It is not accidental that the U.S. State Department's document mentions greatly reducing economic assistance to these Asian countries. Although the United States often boasts that its economic assistance is to help other countries seek economic development, the State Department's document tells us that it not only has no such good intentions at all, but also wants to prevent Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states from requesting economic assistance. This instruction even states: "We must strive to oppose the tendency of Southeast Asia Treaty Organization members to limit themselves solely to seeking economic goals through U.S. aid, and whenever possible, we must prevent plans for establishing economic organizations within the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization from appearing."

    The U.S. State Department's document fully proves that U.S. aid is just a bait. The people of Asian countries are very clear about how to use this bait. U.S. oil tycoon Rockefeller offered Eisenhower such a strategy in a letter: first use U.S. aid to lure a certain country, and after it takes the bait, then put forward political and military demands, and when the United States is already able to control the country, aid is no longer needed, because "a hooked fish does not need bait."

    These documents of the U.S. State Department cannot but make every Asian with national self-esteem feel indignant. But at the same time, for the Asian people, this is also a beneficial thing. It tells people how hypocritical, cunning, and fierce the American colonialists are! The difference between the new type of colonialist in the United States and the old colonialists is that they generally do not use open forms to establish legal colonies, but use means such as organizing military blocs and "aid" to carry out colonialist aggression, gradually placing other countries under their domination. And in order to implement this colonial policy, U.S. diplomats abuse diplomatic privileges, turning every embassy into a magic hand extending from the State Department. They are full of sweet words, but what they do is no different from the thugs and thieves of Chicago and New York. Although these secret documents of the U.S. State Department have only uncovered a corner of the inside story of American diplomacy, it is already enough to constitute the most despicable and dirtiest page in the history of world diplomacy.

    The United States is obviously very angry and uneasy about the exposure of its shady dealings. It wants to deny the authenticity of these secret documents with empty words, but that is impossible. The photos of these secret documents have already been published in the Indian magazine "Blitz," and the United States cannot deny that it lost these documents in the Taipei incident in May of this year.

    This insidious and vicious colonialist aggression activity of the United States will arouse greater awareness and resistance among the Asian people. As long as more and more Asian people see the true face of American imperialism, as long as more and more Asian people unite and carry out resolute struggle, then no matter what methods American imperialism uses, it cannot save the failure of its colonial aggression policy.

    外交史上最卑鄙的一页
    本报评论员
    印度“闪电”周刊最近又刊载了台北美国大使馆遗失的另一个秘密文件。它是美国国务院在3月21日发给美国驻亚洲各地大使馆的关于马尼拉条约堪培拉会议结果的电报指示。这个文件，同美国驻印度尼西亚大使艾利逊给国务院的电报一样，彻底地暴露了美国在亚洲国家所进行的极端阴险的殖民侵略活动。人们看到，美国国务院给它的外交官们规定的主要任务，就是如何干涉、控制和奴役他们的驻在国家。
    文件表明，美国外交官们不仅对执行和平中立政策的亚洲国家进行颠覆活动，而且也使用种种卑鄙的手段，来摆布东南亚条约组织的亚洲成员国的命运，使它们完全处于从属的地位。这些事实最清楚地证明了东南亚条约组织是美国殖民主义的工具。
    美国经常宣传说，东南亚条约组织的目的，是要保护它的成员国的“独立”、“自由”。但是国务院的文件却暴露了这种伪善面目。原来，在美国国务院看来，一个“自由”国家的执政者的神圣职责，不是效忠于祖国，而是必须效忠于美国！国务院指示它在亚洲国家的外交官说：“必须继续努力给那些执政者这样一个印象：他们的地位直接决定于他们对美国的忠诚”。因此，如果这些国家的执政者不合美国的心意，那么他的地位就会危险；因为美国要出来支持那些“对于自由世界（读作美国）所面临的任务表明有了解”的人。同样的，如果这些国家的政局向着不合美国心意的方向发展，那么美国使馆和“从事特别任务的人们”也就要出来加以“制止”。这就是美国所要保护的“独立”、“自由”！
    但是，仅仅靠政治干涉还嫌不够。美国的垄断集团懂得，要完全控制一个国家，就不能忽略它的军队。因此，国务院的文件说：“对东南亚条约组织的亚洲成员的武装部队的控制仍然是我们的首要目的。”为了完成这个任务，国务院指示它的外交官，必须加强对东南亚条约各国“援助”的军事性质，而大大削减经济援助，并且“必须不遗余力地打破当地政府在成立东南亚条约组织联合武装部队和联合司令部问题上的犹豫不决态度”。从这里可以看到，美国的“军事援助”和“联合武装部队”都是一种手段和方式，其目的只是为了加强美国对这些亚洲国家的军事控制和支配权。
    美国国务院的文件提到要大大削减对这些亚洲国家的经济援助，这也不是偶然的。虽然美国经常吹嘘它的经济援助是为了帮助别的国家谋求经济的发展，但国务院的文件却告诉我们，它不但根本没有这种好心肠，并且还要防止东南亚条约组织成员国要求经济援助。这个指示甚至说：“我们必须竭力反对东南亚组织成员把他们自己仅仅局限于通过美国援助来谋求经济目的的趋势，并且不管在什么时候只要有可能就要防止出现在东南亚条约组织内部建立经济组织的计划。”
    美国国务院的文件完全证明了，美援只是一种钓饵。关于这种钓饵的使用法，亚洲各国人民是很清楚的。美国石油大王洛克菲勒在给艾森豪威尔的信中就献过这样的计策：首先用美援来引诱某个国家，当它上钩以后，再提出政治要求和军事要求，等到美国已经能够控制这个国家的时候，援助就不再需要了，因为“上钩的鱼不需要香饵”。
    美国国务院的这些文件不能不使每一个有民族自尊心的亚洲人感到气愤填膺。但同时，对于亚洲人民来说，这也是一件有益的事。它告诉人们，美国殖民主义者是多么虚伪、狡猾、凶狠！美国的新型的殖民主义者同老牌殖民主义者的区别在于：他们一般地不用公开的形式来建立法律上的殖民地，而是用组织军事集团和“援助”等等手段来进行殖民侵略活动，一步步地把别的国家放在自己的支配之下。而为了执行这种殖民政策，美国的外交官竟滥用外交特权，把每一个大使馆都变成了从国务院伸出来的魔手。他们满口甜言蜜语，但是他们干的事情却无异于芝加哥和纽约的流氓和大盗。美国国务院的这些秘密文件虽然还只是揭开了美国外交内幕的一角，但它已经足以构成世界外交史上最卑鄙最龌龊的一页。
    美国对于它的这种见不得人的勾当的被揭露出来，显然感到十分恼怒和不安。它想空口否认这些秘密文件的真实性，那是办不到的。这些秘密文件的照片已经在印度“闪电”周刊发表出来，美国也无法否认它在今年五月的台北事件中损失了这些文件。
    美国的这种阴险毒辣的殖民侵略活动，将会激起亚洲人民更大的觉悟和反抗。只要越来越多的亚洲人民都看清了美帝国主义的真面目，只要越来越多的亚洲人民都团结起来进行坚决的斗争，那么不管美帝国主义使用什么手法，都不能挽救它的殖民侵略政策的失败。
