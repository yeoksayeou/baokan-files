    One Day and Night in Irkutsk
    Tian Han

    Having bid farewell to our dear friends, we boarded the plane in the morning breeze. Looking back, the people at the airport gradually receded into the distance, followed by the willow green of Kunming Lake, the pavilions and ponds of Longevity Hill, the verdant trees and ancient temples of the Western Hills, the rugged outline of the Taihang Mountains, and the winding Great Wall like twin strands of green thread pointed out by the attendant Chen Shuhua. After passing through Zhangjiakou, we gradually entered the desert, and finally, from the left window, we saw Erenhot, where I had been in 1955 and stayed for one night. At that time, besides military tents, there were a few yurts. The station house and the fresh water for making lime had to be transported by train. Now, it looked like a small market town with dozens of families. Entering the Mongolian People's Republic, it was still thousands of miles of yellow sand. Occasionally, we saw people, livestock, and solitary trees. Due to the strong wind, we had a short stop at Sainshand. The second and third planes also arrived successively. Here, the sandy plains were vast and as hard as rock, hence the name Gobi. The planes did not need to build separate runways.

    From Sainshand, we flew all the way to Irkutsk. From the broken piles of snow, we discovered a snow-covered sea of forests, with timber-transporting roads running through them like white small intestines. Suddenly, the plane sailed over deep blue, cold waves with white clouds lingering. The crew told us it was Lake Baikal. I remember when I passed by here to attend the Peace Conference in 1949, the lake was frozen solid, and many ships were frozen on the lake. The mountains around the lake were all wearing white jade crowns. I even made a small painting at the time.

    After getting off the plane in Irkutsk, we had our passports checked and then had a meal. There were a lot of passengers coming and going, but only two or three staff members in the dining hall. Comrade Qian Junrui said that there were also very few people in charge of the airport. Over the years, they had become familiar with the people checking passports. Because there were few service personnel in the dining hall, we sometimes helped ourselves with taking knives, forks, and trays. This is truly a model of streamlined organization and diligent personnel in our fraternal countries. In capitalist countries, passengers might find it objectionable. But let them object; we support this approach.

    The Soviet people showed deep friendship to the Chinese people everywhere. The Soviet government sent a film delegation to participate in our Soviet Film Week, which opened tonight in Beijing. Because they met us in Irkutsk and knew that we were waiting for the Tu-104 plane due to bad weather, they gave us the Tu-104 they had taken, and they took an ordinary civil aviation plane to Beijing instead. Last night, because there were few hotels here, they gave us the good rooms, and they themselves, even the head and deputy head of the delegation, slept in the corridor. We only found out about this the next day. Our delegation expressed our apologies and gratitude to them.

    Except for one or two comrades who were slightly nauseous, everyone else was very healthy and slept well on this trip. Because we had extra time, the various groups of the delegation held discussions on the morning of the 5th. From the understanding of the significance of the October Revolution, the transformation of intellectuals, how pianists and others go to the countryside and mountains without abandoning their professional work, to the reform of Sichuan opera and Peking opera, everyone talked enthusiastically, as if they were still in Beijing, forgetting that they were in a foreign country thousands of miles away.

    Of course, this place is not too far from home. Although there are different opinions among historians, it is said that the place where Su Wu, a Han envoy, herded sheep was near Lake Baikal (the territory of the Mongol Empire included Buryat Mongolia at that time). This place is indeed not close to Moscow, and therefore it was also the place where the Tsars exiled the Decembrists. It is said that these exiled officials left some relics. Unfortunately, we were anxious to wait for the plane and did not have the leisure to visit the ancient sites.

    In the spring of 1949, I returned to China from Prague via the Soviet Union. At that time, Shanghai had not yet been liberated. Comrade Qian Junrui and I were on the same plane. When we flew over Siberia, he wrote a poem and asked me to respond. This time, passing through Siberia again, Comrade Junrui mentioned the old event, so I wrote these few lines to respond to him:

  Celebrating our teacher again on behalf of the people,
  Remembering when we asked for poems in the long sky.
  Baikal's blue waves welcome silver wings,
  Irkutsk's flying flowers rise on red flags;
  Pastoral lands await Su Wu's virtue,
  Among the rocks, there should be Decembrists' steles?;
  Talking about the present and reminiscing about the past, forgetting our journey,
  A report that the "Tu" is coming brings a smile to our faces.

   (Note) ?The Tsars exiled the Decembrists to Irkutsk. At that time, it was probably also a remote and desolate place.
    ?Refers to the Tu-104 jet passenger plane.

    伊尔库次克的一日夜
    田汉
    握别了亲爱的人们，在晨风中上机。遥望机场的人们渐渐地远了，接着是昆明湖的柳色，万寿山的楼台池馆，西山的碧树、古寺，轮廓嶙峋的太行山脉，招待员陈淑华给指出的蜿蜒起伏像双股绿线似的万里长城，经过张家口渐渐进入沙漠，终于从左侧窗口望见1955年到过而且住过一宿的二连。当时除军用帐幕之外还有几个蒙古包，起车站房子和石灰的淡水都得靠火车运来，于今看起去已经是有好几十家人家的小市集了。入蒙古人民共和国境，依然是黄沙千里。偶见人畜和独立树木。因风大，在三因赛达小歇。第二第三机也陆续到了。这里平沙莽莽坚硬如石，所以叫戈壁，飞机也不用另筑跑道。
    由三因赛达我们一气飞到伊尔库次克。从破裂的雪堆里，发现带雪的林海，其间驰走着运材木的公路像白色的小羊肠。一下子飞机在有白云缭绕的深碧的寒波上驶走，机员告诉我们已是贝加尔湖。记得1949年参加和平大会经过这里的时候，湖上正结严冰，许多船只都冻结在湖上。湖边群山都戴着皑皑的玉冠。我还曾作过小画。
    在伊市下飞机后验了护照就吃饭。往来旅客极多，而食堂服务人员就那么三两个。钱俊瑞同志说空港管事的人员也那么少。几年来验护照的也都认熟了。由于食堂服务人少，有时我们自己也帮着取刀叉端菜盘之类，这在我们兄弟国家看来真是机构精简，人员勤奋的范例，而在资本主义国家旅客可能反成为挑眼的由头。但让他们挑吧，我们拥护这种办法。
    苏联人民无处不表现对中国人民的深厚友谊。苏联政府派了一个电影代表团参加我们今晚在北京开幕的苏联电影周。因为在伊尔库次克跟我们相遇，知道我们因天气不好在这里等待图式机未到，竟将他们乘来的图式让给我们，而他们改乘普通民航机赶到北京。昨晚也因这里旅馆少，他们把好房间都让给我们，他们自己，连团长副团长也不另外，都睡在走廊上，这事直到第二天我们才知道。我们代表团向他们致了歉意和感谢。
    此行除一两位同志略有呕吐之外大家都很健康，也都睡得好。由于时间有了余裕。五号的上午代表团各组举行了谈话会。从十月革命的意义的认识，知识分子改造，钢琴家等如何下乡上山而不丢生业务，一直到川剧、京剧等改革问题。大家谈兴甚豪，真像还在北京，忘了在数千里外的外国。
    这里离家当然也还不算太远。虽说在历史家中还有不同的意见，但据说汉苏武牧羊处就在贝加尔湖傍边（蒙古帝国的版图当日包含布利亚特蒙古）。这里离莫斯科倒真是不近，因而也是当日沙皇放逐十二月党人的地方。据说这些逐臣们还留下一些遗迹。可惜我们待机心急，都没访古的闲情罢了。
    1949年春由布拉格经苏联回国，那时上海还没有解放，钱俊瑞同志与我同机，飞经西伯利亚的时候他写了一首诗索和。这次又过西伯利亚，俊瑞同志提起旧事，我才写了这几句和他：
  又代人民庆我师，
  长空索和忆当时。
  贝湖凝碧迎银翼，
  伊市飞花上赤旗；
  牧地待寻苏子节，
  岩间应有党人碑?；
  谈今吊古忘羁旅，
  一报“图”?来尽展眉。
   （注）?沙皇流放十二月党人于伊尔库次克。当时殆亦烟瘴之地。
    ?指图式喷气旅客机。
