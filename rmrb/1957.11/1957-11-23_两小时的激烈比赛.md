    Two Hours of Intense Competition
    On the evening of the 22nd, the Beijing Gymnasium was as brightly lit as daytime. The finals of the National Table Tennis Championships men's and women's team events were underway. The audience's attention was focused on table number five, where Beijing Team A and Shanghai Team A, both with a record of two wins and no losses, were competing for the championship.
    The three players representing Beijing Team A were Wang Chuanyao, Jiang Yongning, and Zhuang Jiafu, the top three finishers in last year's National Table Tennis Championships, key members of the national team, and athletes of master level. Shanghai Team A also had a strong lineup, fielding Yang Ruihua, who defeated Hong Kong champion Rong Guotuan, Xu Yinsheng, a young player who participated in the festival table tennis competition, and veteran Yang Kaiyun.
    In the first match, Wang Chuanyao defeated Xu Yinsheng by using powerful forehand and backhand strokes to exploit Xu Yinsheng's inability to hit backhand smashes. In the second match, Zhuang Jiafu faced the veteran Yang Kaiyun. Experienced Yang Kaiyun immediately used various topspin and backspin serves to induce Zhuang to return the ball out of bounds or high, then scored with powerful smashes. As Zhuang gradually became familiar with his serving patterns, he suddenly used smashes combined with short balls, winning the first game 21-16.
    In the second game, Zhuang had discerned Yang's tactics, using more spin on his chops, preventing Yang from smashing effectively, and also promptly countering Yang's short balls, thus winning the next two games 21-14 and 21-16 to turn the tide.
    The third match was between Jiang Yongning and Yang Ruihua. Yang initially used deceptive smashes to win the first game. After the start of the second game, Jiang Yongning became familiar with his offensive tactics, defended very steadily, and won back two games. The fourth match was Zhuang Jiafu against Xu Yinsheng, Xu was unable to break through Zhuang's defense, losing two games in a row.
    At this point, the score was 4-0 in favor of Beijing. In the fifth match, Wang Chuanyao faced Yang Ruihua. The audience thought that Beijing Team A would win 5-0, but from the start of the match, Yang Ruihua's speed and agility posed a great threat to Wang Chuanyao. Both sides engaged in close-quarters rallies. Wang Chuanyao's specialty, the backhand smash, was suppressed by Yang's blocks. Wang Chuanyao's fierce attacks were returned by Yang Ruihua with lightning speed, and Yang also tried to attack Wang Chuanyao's middle, causing Wang Chuanyao to make many mistakes. Therefore, Yang took the first game 21-16. The competition in the second game was even more intense, going from a 20-20 tie to 23-23, and finally Wang Chuanyao narrowly won 25-23 with two powerful smashes. In the third game, Wang Chuanyao lost 18-21 due to playing more nervously and making more mistakes.
    In the last match, Jiang Yongning defeated Yang Kaiyun 2-0.
    Beijing Team A defeated their last opponent 5-1 and won the honor of the men's team championship.

    两小时的激烈比赛
    22日晚上，北京体育馆内灯光照耀得如白昼一般。全国乒乓球锦标赛男、女团体比赛正在进行决赛。观众的目光都集中在五号台上，在这里，成绩都是两战两胜的北京一队和上海一队正在争夺冠军。
    北京一队上场的三名选手是去年全国乒乓球比赛的前三名、国家队的主力队员、运动健将王传耀、姜永宁、庄家富。上海一队应战的阵容也不弱，他们以战胜香港冠军容国团的杨瑞华、参加联欢节乒乓球比赛的青年选手徐寅生和老将杨开运迎战。
    第一对王传耀对徐寅生的比赛中，徐寅生以反手不能抽击被王传耀用正、反手猛抽击败。第二对庄家富对老将杨开运，富有比赛经验的杨开运一上来便用各种上旋、下旋的发球诱使庄接球出界或较高，然后大拍猛抽得分。当庄渐渐熟悉他发球的规律时，他又突然用猛抽配合放短球，以二十一比十六先胜一局。
    第二局比赛时庄已洞察杨的战术，用更旋转的搓球，使杨不能顺利抽球，还及时赶上反击杨的短球，因此以二十一比十四、二十一比十六连胜两局而反败为胜。
    第三对是姜永宁对杨瑞华，杨一开始便用声东击西的猛抽赢得了第一局，第二局开始后，姜永宁熟悉了他的进攻战术，守得十分稳健，扳回两局。第四对是庄家富对徐寅生之战，徐无法攻破庄的防守，连输两局。
    这时双方的比数是四比零，第五对是王传耀对杨瑞华，观众都认为北京一队将以五比零得胜，谁知比赛一开始，杨瑞华的快速、灵巧便给了王传耀很大的威胁。双方都是短兵相接地对抽。王传耀的专长的反手猛抽被杨的推挡压住，王传耀猛烈一击被杨瑞华挡回的球快得如闪电一般，再加上杨尽量攻击王传耀的中路，使王传耀失误特别多，因此第一局杨以二十一比十六占先。第二局双方竞争更为激烈，从二十平直打至二十三平，最后王传耀两下猛抽才以二十五比二十三险胜。第三局王传耀由于打得较紧张，失误又多，竟以十八比二十一败北。
    最后一对是姜永宁以二比零战胜了杨开运。
    北京一队以五比一击败了他们最后的一个对手，夺得了男子团体赛冠军的荣誉称号。
