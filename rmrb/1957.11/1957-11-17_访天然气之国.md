Visiting the Land of Natural Gas
By our correspondent Ding Man

Beyond the Mountains

In today's world, excluding the United States and the Soviet Union, Romania is the largest producer of natural gas. And the natural gas produced in the Transylvania region accounts for more than 95% of Romania's total.

To get from Bucharest to Transylvania, one must cross the Carpathian Mountains, which stretch across central Romania.

The literal translation of "Transylvania" is "beyond the mountains." For a long time, we had wanted to go beyond the mountains to see the land of natural gas. This wish has finally come true.

We departed from Bucharest, passed through Romania's oil city of Ploiești and Ghenea, and entered the Carpathian Mountains. The mountains have a gap at Stalin City. Heading northwest from Stalin City, we soon exited the Carpathian Mountains. The land suddenly opened up, and the rolling hills of the Transylvanian Plateau stretched out before us. We were already beyond the mountains.

Further ahead, we suddenly saw two roaring flames burning on the side of the road. Upon closer inspection, we realized they were two lime kilns, similar in shape to the earthen kilns used for burning lime in rural northern China. However, the people here do not use firewood or coal as fuel, but natural gas. "Isn't using natural gas to burn lime a waste?" No, because there are too much natural gas reserves here. An expert told me that if Transylvania produced 500 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually, it would be enough to mine for a thousand years, while the current annual output is less than 10 billion cubic meters.

A Young City for Young People

Our car, speeding at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains, made a left turn, and beneath a mountain peak as high as 2,500 meters, we saw a city with neat buildings and wide roads. This is the newly established "Victoria City."

More than a decade ago, this place was still a forest. Now, there is a chemical factory covering hundreds of hectares. The chemical factory has brought life to this deep forest.

With the expansion of the factory, the population of this area has grown from 250 people at the time of liberation to more than 6,500 people today. The average age of the residents is 26 years old. This is a young city for young people.

Shops, schools, cinemas, and other facilities have been built near the factory, as well as the People's Council, which serves as the government body. In 1954, the Grand National Assembly named this city "Victoria City."

The director of the chemical factory took us on a tour of the factory. In the workshops producing ammonia, nitrogen fertilizer, sulfuric acid, and glue, we saw that they used natural gas as their raw material. This natural gas is transported through steel pipes from a place 40 kilometers away. The director told us: "The useful substances in Romanian natural gas, that is, its purity, reaches 99%, which is the purest natural gas in the world. Romania started using natural gas as a chemical raw material in 1936, making it one of the first countries in the world to do so." He said, "Currently, 40% of the world's chemical products are extracted from natural gas."

When leaving the factory, the host asked us to write down our impressions in the comment book. I opened the comment book and saw the inscription of our Vice-Chairman Zhu De on the first page: "From Victory to Victory." Vice-Chairman Zhu visited this factory on December 30, 1955. This factory sent an expert to China last year to help with construction, and he has not yet returned.

The First Factory Using Natural Gas as Raw Material

Leaving Victoria City, we continued to advance into the heart of Transylvania.

As we drove, we suddenly saw a depression in front of us, which looked like a village, with all the trees and houses... a dull gray color. This is the Mica Mountain natural gas factory that we were going to visit.

The host led us into the office. A young expert introduced to us that they are a factory producing carbon black. After hearing this, I was stunned and thought, we came to see natural gas, how did we end up at a carbon black factory?

The expert enthusiastically explained many scientific methods of manufacturing carbon black using natural gas, and also took us to visit three different workshops for manufacturing carbon black. The most modern one is the blast furnace workshop installed with the help of the Soviet Union. This workshop produces 15,000 tons of carbon black annually, while the other two workshops produce two to three thousand tons annually.

The people working in the workshop are as black as charcoal because carbon black covers their entire bodies. They greeted us with smiling big eyes and snow-white teeth. Some young female workers, upon seeing us, rushed to the pool to wash their black faces. After seeing the workshop, our clothes and skin were also covered with black dust.

Carbon black is an important raw material for the rubber industry. Romanian carbon black is exported to many countries such as China, the Soviet Union, and Egypt.

This factory is the first factory in Romania to use natural gas as a chemical raw material, and it started operating in 1936. Before liberation, the products had no sales channels and the output was very low. After liberation, with the help of the Soviet Union, new equipment was installed, and the production capacity was greatly improved. Currently, Romania's carbon black production has increased fifty times compared to before liberation.

Seeing Natural Gas

After seeing the carbon black factory, we visited the place where natural gas is produced. The natural gas production area is right next to the carbon black factory. Here, we first saw a large area of ​​red land. The engineer said that this was in 1932, possibly due to the collision of two stones, which caused a natural gas fire that burned for six years, with the flame reaching a height of 60 meters. Later, hundreds of meters away, fourteen pipes were connected to the burning area, and the flames were extinguished with mud. This piece of land was burned red at that time. Even now, no grass or trees grow here. No one knows how many billions of cubic meters of natural gas were burned in those six years.

There are many natural gas wells in this area. Natural gas emerges from the wells through steel pipes. We entered a guard room, where a natural gas expert was working. He led us to see a natural gas well that started production in 1912. This well is 420 meters deep and is one of the oldest natural gas wells in Transylvania. The well is surrounded by a wooden fence. The engineer told us that it used to take more than a year to drill such a well, but now it only takes a week, because drilling technology has made great progress.

We also visited some newer gas wells. Technicians demonstrated to us, they unscrewed the screw cap on the gas pipe, and the natural gas gushed out of the pipe like smoke, flying straight into the sky.

The expert proudly said: "Although the United States has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, its natural gas is below 4,500 meters underground. In Romania, abundant natural gas is stored below 800 to 1,000 meters."

We asked the expert how natural gas is formed. He said that it is similar to the principle of forming oil, except that due to different temperatures, some become oil and some become natural gas.

An Interlude

The development of natural gas in Romania has a history of nearly half a century. According to Romanian experts, in 1909, the Austro-Hungarian Empire discovered natural gas while searching for potassium salts in a place more than 50 kilometers east of Kurosh City.

By 1913, the Austro-Hungarian Empire had surveyed the entire Transylvania region, identified eighteen structures with natural gas reserves, and drilled the first batch of natural gas wells.

The first pipeline transporting natural gas from Sarmas City to Târgu Mureș City was put into production in 1917. In 1918, the first natural gas street lamp appeared on the streets of Târgu Mureș City.

Before liberation, nine cities in Romania used natural gas.

In recent years, the Romanian People's Government has vigorously developed natural gas. In 1956, the amount of drilling increased nine times compared to 1944, the output increased 4.3 times, and the number of gas pipelines increased 3.5 times. In 1938, before liberation, the average natural gas allocated per person was 19 cubic meters, which increased to 240 cubic meters in 1956.

Currently, natural gas is widely used as a chemical raw material, from which carbon black, ammonia, formic acid, etc. are extracted. Recently, acetylene will be extracted from natural gas, and acetylene is the most basic raw material for manufacturing various daily necessities.

Recently, nine experts have been sent from China to specifically learn the experience of using natural gas as a chemical raw material, because there are also many natural gas deposits in Sichuan Province, China.

The Romanian metallurgical industry is making full use of natural gas as fuel, using it to fire Martin furnaces, for heating, etc. Natural gas is also a very good fuel for burning porcelain, cement, bricks, and tiles. It is also very economical for families and institutions to use it for heating. One cubic meter of natural gas can replace six cubic meters of firewood, which is both clean and convenient.

According to Romania's Second Five-Year Plan, the annual production of natural gas will reach 10 billion cubic meters by 1960. (Attached pictures)

    访天然气之国
    本报记者  丁曼
    山的那边
    在今天的世界上，除去美国、苏联以外，罗马尼亚是出产天然气最多的国家。而德兰斯瓦尼亚地区所产的天然气，又占整个罗马尼亚的95％以上。
    从布加勒斯特到德兰斯瓦尼亚，得越过绵亘罗马尼亚中部的喀尔巴阡山。
    “德兰斯瓦尼亚”的意译就是“山的那边”。很久以来，我们就想到山的那边，到天然气之国去看看。这个愿望终于实现了。
    我们从布加勒斯特出发，经过罗马尼亚的石油城普罗也什蒂和根平，就进入了喀尔巴阡山。山脉在斯大林城有一个缺口。出斯大林城向西北行，不久就走出了喀尔巴阡山区。大地豁然开朗，丘陵起伏的德兰斯瓦尼亚高原伸展在面前，我们已经是在山的那边了。
    再向前走，忽然望见路的一边有两团熊熊的烈火在燃烧，近前一看，才知道是两座石灰窑，形状同我国北方乡下烧石灰的土窑相似，不过此地人不用木柴和煤炭作燃料，而用天然气作燃料。“用天然气烧石灰，这不是浪费吗？”不，因为这里蓄藏的天然气太多了。一位专家告诉我，在德兰斯瓦尼亚，如果每年出产五千亿立方公尺的天然气，它足够开采一千年，而现在的年产量还不到一百亿立方公尺。
    年青人的年青城市
    奔驰在喀尔巴阡山脚下的我们的汽车，向左转了一个弯，在一座高达两千五百公尺的山峰下面，我们看见了一个楼房整齐、道路宽阔的城市，这就是新建立起来的“胜利城”。
    十多年前，这里还是一片森林。现在，这里有一座占地数百公顷的化学工厂。化学工厂把生活带到了这个密林的深处。
    随着工厂的扩大，这个地区的人口由解放时的二百五十人发展到目前的六千五百多人。居民的平均年龄是二十六岁。这是一个年青人的年青的城市。
    工厂附近的商店、学校、电影院等都建立起来，也建立了作为政府机关的人民会议。1954年大国民议会把这个城市命名为“胜利城”。
    化学工厂厂长带我们参观了工厂。在生产氨、氮肥、硫酸和胶等的车间里，我们看到他们用的原料全是天然气。这些天然气，是从四十公里以外的一个地方用钢管输送过来的。厂长告诉我们说：“罗马尼亚天然气中的有用物质，即它的纯度，达99％，是世界上最纯的天然气。罗马尼亚从1936年就开始用天然气作化学原料，也是世界上最早用天然气作化学原料的一个国家。”他说：“目前世界上的40％的化学产品都是从天然气中取出来的。”
    离开工厂时，主人要我们在意见簿上写下自己的印象。我掀开意见簿，在第一页上看到了我们的朱德副主席的题字：“从胜利走向胜利”。朱副主席在1955年12月30日参观了这个工厂。这个工厂去年曾派一位专家到中国帮助建设，现在还没有回来。
    用天然气作原料的第一个工厂
    离开胜利城，我们继续向德兰斯瓦尼亚腹地前进。
    走着，走着，蓦地在我们面前呈现出了一块洼地，洼地上像是有个村落，所有的树木、房屋……都是灰溜溜的。这里就是我们要参观的小高堡山天然气工厂。
    主人把我们领进办公室。一位青年专家向我们介绍说，他们这里是个生产炭黑的工厂。我听到后，楞了一下，想，我们是来看天然气的，怎么又到了炭黑工厂呢？
    专家热心地讲了许多用天然气制造炭黑的科学方法，还带我们参观了制造炭黑的三种不同的车间。最现代化的要算是苏联帮助安装的高炉车间，这个车间年产炭黑一万五千吨，其他的两个车间年产两、三千吨。
    在车间工作的人，都黑如木炭，因为炭黑落满了他们周身。他们用微笑的大眼睛和雪白的牙齿向我们打招呼。有些年轻的女工在看到我们后，急忙跑到水池旁边去洗她们的黑脸蛋。看完车间后，我们的衣服上，皮肤上，也落满了黑的灰尘。
    炭黑是橡胶工业的重要原料。罗马尼亚的炭黑输出到中国、苏联、埃及等许多国家。
    这个工厂是罗马尼亚用天然气作化学原料的第一个工厂，1936年开工的。解放以前，产品没有销路，产量很低。解放以后，在苏联的帮助下，安装了新的设备，生产能力大大提高了。目前罗马尼亚的炭黑产量，比解放以前增加了五十倍。
    看到了天然气
    看完炭黑工厂后，我们参观了出产天然气的地方。天然气产地就在炭黑工厂旁边。在这里，我们首先看到了一大片红红的土地。工程师说，这是在1932年，可能由于两块石头的碰撞，引起天然气失火，一直烧了六年，火头高达六十公尺。后来，在数百公尺以外，把十四个管子通到燃烧处，用泥浆熄灭了火焰。这一片土地就是那时烧红的。直到现在，这里草木不生。没有人知道在六年中烧掉了多少亿立方公尺的天然气。
    这一带有许多天然气井。天然气是由钻井中通过钢管冒出来的。我们走进一间看守室，里边有一位天然气专家在办公。他领我们看了一口1912年开始生产的天然气井，这口井有四百二十公尺深，是德兰斯瓦尼亚最古老的天然气井之一。井的周围围着一圈木篱笆。工程师告诉我们，从前钻这样一口井需要花费一年多的时间，现在只要一个星期就够了，因为钻井技术有了长足的进步。
    我们还参观了一些比较新的气井。技术员表演给我们看，他们扭开气管上的螺丝帽，天然气就像烟雾似的从管子里突突地冒出来，直飞天空。
    专家自豪地说：“美国的天然气储藏量虽居世界第一位，但它的天然气却在四千五百公尺的地层以下，在罗马尼亚，八百到一千公尺以下就藏有丰富的天然气。”
    我们问专家，天然气是怎样形成的？他说，和形成石油的原理差不多，只是因为温度不同，有的变成了石油，有的形成了天然气。
    一段插话
    天然气的开发，在罗马尼亚已有将近半个世纪的历史。据罗马尼亚的专家说，1909年，奥匈帝国为寻找钾盐，在克罗什城东五十多公里的地方发现了天然气。
    到1913年，奥匈帝国勘探了整个德兰斯瓦尼亚地区，找出了十八个储藏天然气的结构，钻了第一批天然气井。
    第一条从赛尔马什城到杜尔什城的输送天然气管道，在1917年投入生产。1918年在杜尔什城的街道上出现了第一盏天然气街灯。
    解放以前，在罗马尼亚有九个城市利用天然气。
    近年来，罗马尼亚人民政府大力开发了天然气。1956年比1944年的钻探量增加了九倍，产量增加了四点三倍，输送气管增加了三点五倍。解放前的1938年，每人平均分到的天然气为十九立方公尺，1956年提高到了二百四十立方公尺。
    目前，天然气被大量的用作化学原料，从中取出炭黑、氨、蚁酸等等。最近，将要从天然气中取出乙炔，乙炔是制造各种日用品的最基本的原料。
    最近从中国派来了九位专家，专门学习利用天然气作化学原料的经验，因为在我国的四川省也藏有很多的天然气。
    罗马尼亚的冶金工业在充分利用天然气作燃料，用它烧马丁炉、加热等等。天然气也是烧瓷器、洋灰、砖瓦等等的很好的燃料。家庭、机关用它取暖也非常经济，一立方公尺的天然气可以代替六立方公尺木柴，既清洁又方便。
    按照罗马尼亚的第二个五年计划，到1960年将年产天然气一百亿立方公尺。（附图片）
