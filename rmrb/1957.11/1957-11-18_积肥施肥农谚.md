Agricultural Proverbs on Manure Accumulation and Fertilization

	Water flows endlessly, manure can be accumulated without end.
		* A sweeping broom leads to a growing manure pile.
		* Pig manure and red clover are the two treasures of a farming family.
		* If you farm without raising pigs, you're sure to lose something.
		* Home soil is a tiger in the field.
		* People rely on full meals, fields rely on fertilizer.
		* Enough fertilizer means more grain; one harvest is as good as two.
		* People coax the land, and the land fills their bellies.
		* Work diligently and add bedding often, manuring every ten days.
		* Scholars need to study, farmers need to raise pigs.
		* A crop is like a flower, relying entirely on manure to thrive.
