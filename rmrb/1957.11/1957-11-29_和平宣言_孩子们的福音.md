    A Peace Declaration - Good News for Children
    To the Editor:
    The Peace Declaration issued after the friendly meeting in Moscow of the delegations of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution represents our wishes and is good news for millions of children.
    The Peace Declaration made me see the invincible power of the people of the world fighting for peace, thereby further strengthening my will to defend peace. Children need to grow up in a peaceful environment.
    We should tell every child and young person: It is imperialism that is plotting to launch a war, intending to burn down our hometowns, schools, fathers, mothers, teachers, and children with artillery fire...; children should be made aware that the socialist camp has unparalleled power, so that they can also actively take action to defend peace and hate the heinous warmongers. It is our responsibility to allow innocent and lively children to live and be educated in a peaceful and happy environment, and to allow them to grow and strengthen without worry. If imperialism dares to destroy the happiness of our children, we will rise up and fight until imperialism is destroyed!

    和平宣言——孩子们的福音编辑同志：
    参加庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的各国共产党和工人党代表团，在莫斯科友好会见后发出的和平宣言，代表了我们的心愿，它是千千万万孩子们的福音。
    和平宣言使我看到了世界人民为和平而斗争的无敌力量，从而更增强了我保卫和平的意志。孩子们需要在和平的环境里生长。
    我们应该告诉每一个少年儿童：是帝国主义在阴谋发动战争，打算用炮火烧毁我们的家乡、学校、爸爸、妈妈、老师、小朋友……；应该让孩子们知道，社会主义阵营有无比强大的力量，使他们也积极行动起来，保卫和平，仇恨罪恶滔天的战争贩子。我们每个人都有责任让天真活泼的孩子们生活和教养在和平和幸福的环境中，让他们无忧无虑地成长壮大。帝国主义如敢破坏我们的孩子们的幸福，我们就要奋起战斗，直到帝国主义灭亡！	  张家口大兴园巷小学  赵旺
