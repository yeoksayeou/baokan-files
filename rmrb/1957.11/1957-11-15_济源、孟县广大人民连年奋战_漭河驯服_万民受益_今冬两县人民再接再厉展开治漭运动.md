    Our Newspaper Reports: The vast people in the Mang River basin in northern Henan Province are continuing their great march towards the 130-kilometer-long Mang River with the force of moving mountains and overturning seas. From the Taihang Mountains in the north to the Yellow River in the south, the sounds of pounding earth and the clang of hoes and mattocks can be heard everywhere in the more than 1,300 square kilometers of land. Their slogans are: afforest barren mountains, terrace slopes, turn gully land into terraces, and irrigate plains, and strive to complete the first phase of the Mang River management project in two more winters and springs, completely eliminate drought and flood disasters, and ensure greater agricultural production harvests.
    Starting in 1949, the Communist Party and the People's Government led the people to manage this Mang River, which was more harmful than beneficial. However, due to the unclear management policies at that time, insufficient management experience, and especially the great limitations of carrying out mass water conservancy construction on the basis of a small-scale peasant economy, little progress was made. By the winter of 1955, the high tide of agricultural cooperation brought about a high tide of water conservancy construction. The vast masses of people in the Mang River basin, based on the principles of overall planning, comprehensive management, and focusing on small-scale projects, combined with the natural characteristics of the Mang River basin, launched a vigorous mass Mang River management campaign. After two or three winters and springs of comprehensive management, together with previous projects, more than 75% of the total Mang River project has been completed. This includes: afforestation of 220,000 mu of mountains, renovation of 380,000 mu of terraces, construction of 6,500 water cellars, construction of 60 small reservoirs, expansion of irrigated land by 200,000 mu, construction of 30,000 mu of gully terraces, and the construction of a mechanical pumping station, two diversion gates, two power stations, and a flood discharge channel on the main stream. The above water conservancy and soil and water conservation construction projects have shown good results. Before management, in the 1953 flood season, the rainfall was 540 mm, and the Mang River flow was 500 cubic meters per second, flooding 120,000 mu of land; after management, in the 1957 flood season, Jiyuan had 560 mm of rain, but the Mang River only had a flow of 70 cubic meters per second, reducing the flood flow by 86%. At the same time, due to the fact that most of the plains areas have realized irrigation, and most of the low-lying areas have been freed from the threat of mountain floods and internal waterlogging, the Mang River basin has basically eliminated water and drought disasters, and the natural appearance of the entire basin has undergone significant changes. The first manifestation is the significant increase in agricultural production, and high-yield records of thousands of catties of grain and ten thousand catties of vegetables per mu have appeared everywhere. In 1956, the yield per unit area in Meng County exceeded the requirement of 400 catties per mu in the National Agricultural Development Program. Jiyuan County's total grain output in 1956 was double that of 1952. At the same time, forestry and animal husbandry have also developed greatly. Jiyuan County has reached the level of one pig per household. However, the people in the Mang River basin are not satisfied with today's development of production and improvement of life. According to their plan, after the entire Mang River management project is completed, by 1962, the yield per mu of grain will increase from the current 250 catties to 400 catties in mountainous areas, from the current 310 catties to 600 catties in hilly areas, and from the current 350 catties to 800 catties in plains areas.

    济源、孟县广大人民连年奋战
    漭河驯服　万民受益
    今冬两县人民再接再厉展开治漭运动
    本报讯　河南省北部漭河流域的广大人民，正以移山倒海的气势，继续向全长一百三十公里的漭河展开大进军。北起太行山，南到黄河边，在一千三百多平方公里的土地上，到处响着打硪的吭唷声，镢铣的铿锵声。他们口号是：荒山绿化，坡地梯田化，沟地川台化，平地水利化，争取再经过两个冬春，全面完成漭河第一期治理工程，彻底消灭旱涝灾害，保证农业生产的更大丰收。
    从1949年开始，共产党和人民政府就领导人民治理这条有百害而无一利的漭河。但是，由于当时治理方针不明，治理经验不足，特别是在小农经济的基础上，开展群众性的水利建设，受着很大的限制，所以没有多大进展。到1955年冬季，农业合作化高潮带来了水利建设高潮。漭河流域的广大人民群众，根据全面规划，综合治理，以小型为主的方针，结合漭河流域的自然特点，展开了热火朝天的群众性的治漭运动。经过两三个冬春的综合治理，连同以前工程，已完成了漭河总工程量的75％以上。计有：封山造林二十二万亩，整修梯田三十八万亩，打水窖六千五百个，修小型水库六十个，扩大水浇地二十万亩，修筑沟洫台田三万亩，并在干流上修了一个机械抽水站，两座节制闸，两座发电站，一个泄洪道。以上各项水利和水土保持建设工程，已显示出良好的效果。在治理前，1953年汛期雨量五百四十公厘、漭河流量为五百秒公方，淹地十二万亩；治理后，1957年汛期，济源下了五百六十公厘的雨，漭河却只出现了七十秒公方的流量，削减了洪水流量86％。同时，由于平原地区大部分实现了水利化，低洼地区大部分摆脱了山洪内涝的威胁，漭河流域就基本上消灭了水旱灾害，使整个流域的自然面貌发生了显著的变化。首先表现在农业生产显著的提高，到处都出现了亩产千斤粮、万斤菜的高额丰产纪录。孟县全县的单位面积产量，在1956年已超过全国农业发展纲要亩产四百斤的要求。济源县1956年的粮食总产量比1952年增产一倍。同时林业、牧业也都有了很大的发展。济源县已达到一户养一头猪的水平。但是，漭河流域的人民，对今天生产的发展和生活的提高，并没有满足。按照他们的规划，在治漭工程全部完成以后，到1962年，粮食的亩产量，山区将由现在的二百五十斤提高到四百斤，丘陵区将由现在的三百一十斤提高到六百斤，平原地区将由现在的三百五十斤提高到八百斤。
