Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: People's Liberation Army units stationed across the country are enthusiastically carrying out activities to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution.

The PLA units stationed in Beijing recently held a report meeting at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall, attended by more than 3,600 army, navy, and air force officers. Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, gave a report at the meeting. Communist Youth League members from the PLA headquarters invited Wang Hongxun, a 62-year-old revolutionary veteran, to report on his participation in the October Revolution and how he heard Comrade Lenin's speech at the Finland Station in Petrograd.

Combat heroes and cadres from heroic units stationed in Guangzhou held a forum to study the Soviet Army and the heroes of the Soviet Patriotic War. Zhao Chunsheng, Director of the Political Department of the regiment to which the "Dadu River Company" and "Langya Mountain Company" belong, said at the forum that the heroic PLA soldiers who sacrificed themselves on Langya Mountain had heard the story of the five heroes of Sevastopol of the Black Sea Fleet before their deaths, and this story inspired them to dedicate themselves to the motherland. Xiu Shanghui, Director of the Political Department of the "Tower Mountain Hero Regiment," said that since conducting regular training, their unit has mobilized the masses to learn from the Soviet Army's practical training requirements, and progress has been significant.

Units stationed in Beijing, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other places have dispatched many film projection teams, carrying Soviet films such as "Prelude to Revolution," "How the Steel Was Tempered," and "Whirlwind of Hatred," to the coastal defense outposts and units performing dispersed duties for mobile screenings. PLA units stationed in Liaoning Province dispatched twenty film projection teams, carrying more than fifty Soviet films to perform for border and coastal defense units.

Leaders, engineers, and other personnel of the Railway Corps have written articles for the unit newspapers, expressing gratitude to the Soviet experts for their assistance to the Railway Corps. Library organizations in various units have organized mobile picture and book reading groups to go deep into construction sites to provide reading materials for officers and soldiers.

Celebratory activities are also very active in units stationed in Yunnan, Shandong, Gansu, and other places.
