    Struggle to Realize the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program
    More Than 2,000 Cadres in Jiangsu Go to the Countryside to Become Farmers

    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th dispatch) As of the 15th, 2,267 staff members from Jiangsu province-level organizations have been approved to go to the countryside to become farmers and struggle to realize the forty articles of the agricultural program. Many comrades here believe that this is a powerful measure to promote the cause of socialist revolution and construction.

    On the afternoon of the 15th, the Jiangsu provincial leadership organs convened a grand send-off rally attended by more than 15,000 people. Leading comrades from the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee personally attended the rally to bid farewell. Comrade Liu Shunyuan, Acting First Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He profoundly analyzed the significance of this participation of the office staff in agricultural production. He said: Recently, at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward to us the great task and vision of continuing the socialist revolution after the victory of the democratic revolution. In particular, after the Party Central Committee promulgated the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), many comrades were greatly encouraged, and revolutionary enthusiasm was greatly increased. The slogan of going to the countryside, going up the mountains, and going down to the villages to become farmers has become a common demand of the office cadres. Many organs have set off a wave of enthusiasm for registering to go to the countryside to become farmers. The number of applicants generally accounts for 80% to 90% of the existing staff in the organs. Examples of wives encouraging husbands, parents encouraging children, and comrades supporting and encouraging each other have emerged everywhere. Many offices are plastered with big-character posters and resolutions demanding to be sent down to the countryside to go up the mountains and become farmers. Some comrades have even written "Songs of Going to the Countryside" to express their aspirations to go to the countryside.

    Comrade Liu Shunyuan pointed out: Many comrades who go to the countryside have made guarantees, willing to be farmers for a lifetime to build a new countryside. This determination is valuable, but the purpose of these comrades going to the countryside should not be simply to be a farmer, but to struggle to realize the forty articles of the agricultural program. The forty articles are not only a program for developing agriculture, but also a very important revolutionary measure to promote national industrialization and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The comrades who go to the countryside should also take the forty articles as the center and use their cultural knowledge to promote the development of rural cultural and technical undertakings.

    A total of 2,267 cadres were approved to go to the countryside this time, accounting for 13% of the existing staff in the organs. Among them, there were 406 female comrades, a small number of whom were not suitable for participating in agricultural labor and were approved to participate in housework. Among these staff members, there are a total of 587 Party members and 799 Communist Youth League members, accounting for 61% of the number of people going to the countryside. Among them, there are also 109 cadres at the section chief level and above, and 124 cadres who participated in the revolution during the War of Resistance Against Japan. At this farewell meeting, Zhu Yixiang, Section Chief of the Supply and Marketing Section of the Provincial Handicraft Industry Bureau, Yang Liuqi, Teaching Assistant of the Provincial Lecturers Group, and Dai Jin, cadre of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, spoke on behalf of the old cadres, young cadres, and female cadres respectively, guaranteeing that they would play a backbone role after going to the countryside, fight against difficulties with the revolutionary spirit of making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way, humbly learn from the peasants, and temper and transform themselves through labor and practical struggle, so that they can become the first generation of cultured farmers.

    为实现农业发展纲要四十条而斗争
    江苏两千多名干部下乡当农民
    本报南京16日电  到15日止，江苏省一级机关的二千二百六十七名工作人员，已被批准下乡当农民，为实现农业纲要四十条而斗争。这里许多同志认为：这是一个促进社会主义革命和建设事业的有力措施。
    15日下午，江苏省领导机关召开了有一万五千多人参加的欢送大会，中共江苏省委和省人民委员会的负责同志，都亲自到会欢送。中共江苏省委代理第一书记刘顺元同志在会上讲话。他深刻地分析了这次机关工作人员参加农业生产的意义。他说：最近中央八届三中全会上，党中央和毛主席向我们提出了在民主革命胜利之后，继续进行社会主义革命的伟大任务和远景。特别是党中央公布了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）以后，许多同志受到很大的鼓舞，革命热情大为高涨。到农村去，上山下乡当农民的口号已成为机关干部共同的要求。许多机关掀起了下乡当农民的报名热潮。报名人数一般都占到机关现有人数的80％到90％，到处出现妻子鼓励丈夫，父母鼓励子女，同志之间互相支持鼓励的事例。许多机关里到处都贴满了要求下放上山当农民的大字报和决心书，有些同志还写了“走向农村之歌”表达下乡的志愿。
    刘顺元同志指出：许多下乡的同志提出保证，为建设新农村，愿意一辈子当农民，这种决心是可贵的，但是我们这些同志下乡，并不简简单单的当个农民，下乡的目的应该为实现农业纲要四十条而斗争。四十条纲要，不仅是一个发展农业的纲要，而且是促进国家工业化，巩固工农联盟的十分重要的革命措施。下乡的同志还应该以四十条为中心，运用他们的文化知识，促进农村文化技术事业的发展。
    这次批准下乡干部共二千二百六十七人，占机关现有人数的13％，其中有女同志四百零六人，她们当中有小部分人不适宜参加农业劳动，被批准参加家务劳动。这批工作人员中共有党员五百八十七人，共青团员七百九十九人，共占下乡人数的61％，他们之中还有科长以上干部一百零九人，抗战时期参加革命的干部一百二十四人。在这次欢送会上，省手工业管理局供销科科长朱一香、省讲师团助教杨六奇、省供销社干部戴进，分别代表老干部、青年干部和女干部讲话，保证在下乡后起骨干作用，以让高山低头、要河水让路的革命精神向困难作斗争，虚心向农民学习，从劳动和实际斗争中锻炼和改造自己，使自己成为第一代有文化的农民。
