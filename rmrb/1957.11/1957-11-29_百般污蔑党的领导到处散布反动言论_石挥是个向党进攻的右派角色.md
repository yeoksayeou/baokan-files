Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th. Shanghai Film Studio recently exposed another rightist, film actor Shi Hui. His anti-communist words and deeds and reactionary literary line have been thoroughly exposed and criticized.

	In the tide of the rightists' rampant attack on the Party, Shi Hui, who was reactionary by nature, attacked the Party everywhere in newspapers, magazines, symposiums, film studios, and crosstalk performances, attempting to abolish the Party's leadership over art.

	Shi Hui was the first to come out and slander the Communist Party for severing the tradition of Chinese cinema. Shi Hui regarded bourgeois film art as the tradition of China and himself as the embodiment of tradition. He distorted the facts and said, "After liberation, the past of Chinese cinema was not mentioned at all." "Therefore, film workers who lived through the old society are not valued." In fact, after liberation, the Party attached great importance to film workers of the past. Shi Hui himself not only enjoyed the treatment of senior intellectuals but was also elected as a representative of the Shanghai People's Congress and invited to participate in the propaganda conference held by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China this year. However, Shi Hui consistently complained that the Communist Party did not value him. He said to others, "These years since liberation, I have been greatly undervalued." "I am valued today because I have a large audience." Shi Hui shouted "respecting the tradition of Chinese cinema" but showed extreme disrespect to some old directors and actors who had genuine artistic attainments and were valued by the Party. Zhang Junxiang, Zheng Junli, Zhao Ming, Huang Zongying, and many others were ridiculed and scolded by him behind their backs. Huang Zuolin, a famous director who had worked with Shi Hui for fifteen or sixteen years, revealed that Shi Hui had deviated from progressive drama troupes as early as the end of the War of Resistance against Japan and embarked on the decadent capitalist road. His performing arts deteriorated, and he later performed some vulgar and inferior images.

	Shi Hui used the guise of "film tradition" to negate the achievements of the people's film industry in recent years and dreamed of restoring the bourgeois literary line. Ignoring the facts, he said, "We talk about films with strong ideological content and well-made films in our studio, but no one watches them after they are released." Regarding the fact that the film "Shangganling" was welcomed, he distorted it by saying, "The popularity of 'Shangganling' is due to the role of the Youth League in organizing the audience, not the achievement of the film itself." Before the Shanghai Film Studio was divided into branches, Shi Hui rushed to win over a group of people to organize a director creation team called "Wuhuashe," attempting to create a fait accompli to establish a studio, excluding the leadership of the Party. His "Wuhuashe" resolutely opposed the participation of Party member directors and openly opposed learning the advanced Stanislavski acting system. Since liberation, Shi Hui has consistently disseminated his reactionary ideas by directing and writing films, and he has tried his best to uglify the People's Liberation Army and veteran cadres in his films.

	Shi Hui even more used the guise of "film tradition" to oppose the planning of the people's film industry, oppose the orientation towards workers, peasants, and soldiers, and oppose the leadership of the Party. He demanded that the Party's leadership over film art be reduced to a relationship of mutual academic research. He slandered, "Now there are more directors who obey orders than those who argue according to reason." "The tasks are assigned by the leaders, which makes the directors lose their initiative." As early as 1953, when filming "Chicken Feather Letter," Shi Hui viciously cursed the Film Bureau as a police station. When the Film Bureau sent people to assist him in his work, he slandered, "This is a policeman sent by the police station." "Our shooting and summarizing must go through the police station." He also used crosstalk to satirize and uglify the负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge) of the Film Bureau.

	In order to undermine the prestige of the Party, Shi Hui incited the masses to be dissatisfied with the Party everywhere. He used facts fabricated by rightists in the Shanghai People's Art Theater to incite at a forum of young actors, saying, "The problem of the People's Art Theater is simply a tragedy of the new society," saying that "the problem of the People's Art Theater is no longer a question of artists demanding creative imagination, but that many actors are equivalent to being unemployed." He provoked and won over young actors, saying, "I think the term 'acting' should be clarified together with the leadership. His profession is acting, and he should not engage in other things. In the future, you should act more and be bolder." He even more viciously extended it, saying, "People who have already chosen a profession dare not express their aspirations, let alone young students who have not chosen a profession." He slandered young students for obeying the organization's unified assignment as "telling lies" and "daring not to express their aspirations."

	The masses also angrily exposed Shi Hui's acts of sheltering counter-revolutionaries and his extremely degenerate and corrupt behavior in life, such as theft and insulting women. They unanimously believed that he was not only a rightist but also a complete bad element.

### 百般污蔑党的领导到处散布反动言论  石挥是个向党进攻的右派角色

    百般污蔑党的领导到处散布反动言论
    石挥是个向党进攻的右派角色
    据新华社上海28日电　上海电影制片公司最近又揭发出一个右派分子、电影演员石挥，他的反共言行和反动的文艺路线受到彻底揭露和批驳。
    在右派分子向党猖狂进攻的浪潮里，反动成性的石挥，在报纸、杂志、座谈会、电影制片厂和说相声等各种场合四处向党进攻，妄图取消党对艺术的领导。
    石挥第一个站出来污蔑共产党割断了中国电影的传统。石挥把资产阶级的电影艺术看作是中国的传统，并把自己作为传统的化身。他抹煞事实说：“解放后对中国电影的过去一字不提。”“因此对从旧社会中生活过来的电影工作者就不重视”。事实上解放后党对过去的电影工作者很重视，石挥本人不但享受着高级知识分子的待遇，还被选为上海市人民代表，应邀参加了今年中共中央召开的宣传会议。而石挥却一贯抱怨共产党对他不重视，他对人说：“解放这几年，我是大廉价。”“我今天被重视是因为我有广大观众。”石挥嘴里高喊“重视中国电影的传统”，却对一些真正有艺术造诣为党所重视的老导演、老演员极不尊重，张骏祥、郑君里、赵明、黄宗英等许多人都背地里受到他的讽刺、谩骂。曾与石挥共事十五、六年的著名导演黄佐临揭露说：石挥早在抗战末期就背离进步戏剧团体，走上了腐朽的资本主义道路，表演艺术每况愈下，后来竟演出了一些庸俗恶劣的形象。
    石挥利用“电影传统”的幌子，否定几年来人民电影事业的成就，梦想恢复资产阶级文艺路线。他不顾事实说：“我们厂里谈来谈去思想性强的、拍得好的影片，可就是出了门没人看，”对影片“上甘岭”受到欢迎的事实，他又歪曲说：“上甘岭”受欢迎是青年团组织观众发生的作用，不是影片本身的成就。上影分厂以前，石挥抢先拉拢了一帮人组织了一个导演创作小组“五花社”，企图造成既成事实成立一个厂，排斥党的领导，他的“五花社”坚决反对党员导演参加，还公开反对学习先进的史坦尼斯拉夫斯基表演体系。解放以来石挥一贯通过编导电影传播他的反动思想，曾在影片中竭力丑化解放军和老干部。
    石挥更利用“电影传统”的幌子反对人民电影事业的计划性，反对工农兵方向和党的领导。他要求党对电影艺术的领导降低到相互研究学术的关系。他污蔑说：“现在的导演是唯命是从者多，据理力争者少。”“任务由领导分配，使导演丧失了主动性。”早在1953年拍摄鸡毛信的时候，石挥就恶毒地骂电影局是警察局。电影局派人协助他工作，他却污蔑说：“这是警察局派来的警察。”“咱们拍镜头、总结都要经过警察局。”他还利用说相声，讽刺丑化电影局的负责人。
    为了打击党的威信，石挥到处煽动群众对党不满。他利用上海人民艺术剧院右派分子捏造的事实，在青年演员座谈会上煽动说：“人艺问题简直是新社会的悲剧”，说“人艺的问题已经不是艺术家要求创作想像问题，而是许多演员等于失业。”他挑拨拉拢青年演员说：“演戏这个名词，我认为应该和领导一起来明确一下，他的职业就是演戏，不应搞其他的事，以后你们应该多演戏，胆子要大。”他更恶毒地引伸说：“已经选定职业的人尚不敢言志，何况没有选定职业的青年学生呢，”他污蔑青年学生服从组织统一分配是“说假话”、是“不敢言志”。
    群众还愤怒地揭发了石挥包庇反革命和盗窃、凌辱妇女等生活上极端堕落腐化的行为，一致认为他既是个右派分子，又是个彻头彻尾的坏分子。
