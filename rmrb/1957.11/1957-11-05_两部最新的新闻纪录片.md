    Two Latest News Documentaries
    The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio is currently producing two films.
    "News Brief No. 63" is a special issue celebrating the October Revolution. The main content includes Chairman Mao leading the Chinese government delegation to the Soviet Union, people watching the situation of artificial satellites and the trajectory of the satellites, and excerpts from the famous Soviet drama "The Man with a Gun" performed by the Beijing People's Art Theater. It will be screened in Beijing first on November 7th, while people are celebrating the festival.
      "Celebrating the October Revolution" is a short documentary. The film will begin with the loud lines of the protagonist, Gorton, from the last scene of the famous Soviet drama "The Breakup" performed by the Shanghai Theatre Academy, who says: "Comrades! We are about to march, this is a great march, we must unhesitatingly and resolutely break with the bourgeoisie, and completely smash the bourgeoisie." The film then transitions to the October Revolution Exhibition. Then it reports on the activities of all sectors of the capital before the festival, including the recording of Chairman Mao leading the Chinese government delegation to the Soviet Union and the grand celebration banquet at the Soviet Embassy. The activities of the festival day will also be filmed, including the grand celebration meeting of all sectors of the capital, the recorded speeches of Chinese leaders and Soviet guests, and the exquisite performances of artists from both countries. The film will end with the joyous night in Tiananmen Square – fireworks are brilliant, singing and dancing are in full swing, and there is a joyful atmosphere.
    This film will meet the audience in mid-November. (Xin Xuan)

    两部最新的新闻纪录片
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂正在摄制两部影片。
    “新闻简报63号”是庆祝十月革命节专号，主要内容有：毛主席率领中国政府代表团赴苏，人们观看人造卫星的情况和卫星的行踪，北京人民艺术剧院上演的苏联名剧“带枪的人”的片断等。它将在11月7日人们欢庆节日的同时，首先在北京上映。
      “庆祝十月革命节”是一部短纪录片。影片将从上海戏剧学院演出的苏联名剧“决裂”最后一幕，主角戈东响亮的台词声中开始，他说：“同志们！我们就要进军了，这是一次伟大的进军，我们要毫不犹疑地、坚决地和资产阶级决裂，要彻底地粉碎资产阶级。”影片接着转入十月革命展览会。再接着就报道节日前首都各界的活动，其中还纪录了毛主席率领中国政府代表团赴苏和苏联大使馆盛大的庆祝宴会。节日当天的活动也将摄入镜头，包括首都各界隆重盛大的庆祝大会、中国首长和苏联贵宾的讲话录音和两国艺术家们的精湛表演。影片将以天安门广场欢腾之夜——礼花灿烂、尽情歌舞、一片欢乐声中结束。
    这部影片将在11月中旬与观众见面。（新宣）
