Xinhua News Agency, New York, 23rd: Rear Admiral Rickover, Director of the Naval Reactor Group of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, said on the 22nd that the Soviet Union's successful launch of an artificial satellite "pierced the thick armor of American complacency in believing that it is now and will be in the future in the leading position technically." He called for a "thorough reorganization of the American education system" and "greatly improved academic standards" to train enough talent.

He said: "Indeed, the Soviet satellite immediately proved to be a victory for Russian education." He urged the United States to use the Soviet satellite as a mirror to "reform the long overdue" American education.

Former President Hoover also said on the evening of the 21st that the Soviet Union trains "twice as many, maybe even twice as many" scientists and technicians each year as the United States. He pointed out that the current number of people trained in this area in the United States each year is even less than half the number trained annually seven years ago.

Atomic energy expert Dr. Wheeler said that the United States must catch up with scientific progress, otherwise it will "decline."

He said: "The emergence of the Soviet satellite has made some countries worry that the strength of the United States is no longer sufficient to guarantee their safety and are turning to Russia for help."

    美国那套厚盔甲戳穿了
    美国政界人士承认科学技术落后
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：美国原子能委员会海军反应堆组主任里科弗海军少将22日说，苏联发射人造卫星成功这件事“戳穿了美国自满地相信自己现在和将来在技术上都是占第一把交椅的那套厚盔甲”。他要求“彻底改组美国教育制度”，并要有“大大提高的学术水平”以便训练足够的人才。
    他说：“的的确确，苏联人造卫星一开始就证明是俄国教育的一次胜利。”他要求美国把苏联的人造卫星作为借镜来“改革早就该改革的”美国教育。
    前总统胡佛也在21日晚上说，苏联每年培养的科学家和技术人员“比美国多一倍，也可能多两倍”。他指出，目前美国每年在这方面训练的人数甚至不及七年以前每年所训练的人数的一半。
    原子能专家惠勒博士说，美国必须赶上科学的进展，否则就要“没落”了。
    他说：“苏联人造卫星的出现使某些国家担心美国的力量已经不足以担保它们的安全而正在转向俄国要求帮助。”
