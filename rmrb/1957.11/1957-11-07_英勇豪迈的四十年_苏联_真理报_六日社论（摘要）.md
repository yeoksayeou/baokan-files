Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 6th: According to TASS, the "Pravda" published an editorial on November 6th entitled "Forty Heroic and Inspiring Years," stating that the Soviet people, the people of all socialist countries, the working class and working people of the world are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, which opened the road to communism for mankind. The fact that many foreign delegations and foreign friends are in Moscow today to attend the celebration held by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union once again powerfully demonstrates the international significance and world historical significance of the October Revolution.

The editorial stated that the further away we are from that memorable day of October 25, 1917 (i.e., November 7th according to the Gregorian calendar), the clearer and more fully the historical significance of this revolution and its powerful and indelible impact on the destiny of mankind become apparent.

The October Revolution was the first victorious socialist revolution in the world. The result of the October Revolution was the establishment of Soviet power in our country, the elimination of all oppression and exploitation, and the establishment of the socialist system. Forty unforgettable years have passed. Now everyone can see how brilliant the achievements the Soviet working class, in alliance with the peasantry, has made on the road opened up by the October Revolution. Socialism, which the revolution initially declared as merely a goal to strive for, a task to be solved, has now become a reality, a creative endeavor of millions upon millions of people, and their very life. The construction of socialism is the main achievement of the development of the Soviet system and the result of the struggle and labor of the Soviet people.

The editorial continued, saying that the era of poverty and backwardness in our country has long since passed. Now, the Soviet Union ranks second in the world in terms of industrial development and has become a powerful industrial nation. Thanks to the Party's thorough implementation of Lenin's general line of socialist industrialization, our country has traversed in an unprecedentedly short period of time the road that bourgeois countries would take decades, or even centuries, to complete. Now, our country possesses all the necessary conditions to ensure that it will solve a fundamental economic task in the shortest historical period - to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita industrial production.

One of the most complex tasks of the revolution – the socialist transformation of agriculture – has been successfully resolved in our country. Thanks to the measures taken by the Communist Party, our agriculture is advancing rapidly.

Soviet power has brought genuine equality and freedom to all nationalities living in our motherland. The cultural revolution implemented in the Soviet Union has promoted the rapid prosperity of science and technology, literature and art, and has unprecedentedly enriched the spiritual life of the people. The launch of the world's first two Soviet artificial earth satellites, which have aroused universal amazement and praise, is a clear manifestation of the high level of scientific and technological development.

The editorial said that the great ideas of the October Revolution inspire the working people of all countries who are fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution is the most significant event in world history since the October Revolution. The people of several European and Asian countries have also embarked on the road of socialism. The strong fortress of world peace – the world socialist system – has been formed. The strength of the socialist forces lies in the unity, unbreakable friendship, and fraternal mutual assistance of the socialist countries. The emergence and development of the world socialist system is the greatest victory of Marxism-Leninism.

The editorial said that as it enters the fifties of the October Revolution, the Soviet people, under the leadership of their long-tested leader, the Communist Party, are victoriously implementing the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, which formulated a magnificent program for communist construction. Socialism in the Soviet Union has been created and established on the basis of the conscious and free creative labor of millions upon millions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. The reason why the Communist Party and the Soviet government have continuously achieved great and rapidly increasing achievements in the construction of a new society is because the force they rely on is the most outstanding force in the world: the power of workers and peasants.

The editorial concluded that all the great victories of the Soviet people in socialist construction have been achieved under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, which holds high the victorious banner of the October Revolution and the banner of Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Party and the Soviet people are united as one. On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, the working class, collective farmers, and Soviet intellectuals are more closely united around the Communist Party. They understand that this unity is the reliable guarantee of the power of the Soviet state and the reliable guarantee of the smooth construction of communism.

    英勇豪迈的四十年
    ——苏联“真理报”六日社论（摘要）
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”6日在一篇题为“英勇豪迈的四十年”的社论中说，苏联人民、各社会主义国家的人民、全世界的工人阶级和劳动人民同声欢庆为人类开辟了走向共产主义道路的十月社会主义革命四十周年。许多外国代表团和外国朋友们今天在莫斯科参加苏联最高苏维埃举行的庆祝会这件事，又一次十分有力地说明了十月革命具有世界历史意义的国际意义。
    社论说，1917年10月25日（按即公历11月7日）这个值得纪念的日子离开我们越远，就越加清楚而且更加充分地显示出这个革命的历史意义，以及它对人类命运所起的强大的不可磨灭的影响。
    十月革命是世界上第一个胜利的社会主义革命。十月革命的结果是在我们国家建立了苏维埃政权，消除了任何压迫和剥削，建立了社会主义制度。难以忘记的四十年过去了。现在大家都看到，苏联工人阶级同农民结成联盟，在十月革命所开辟的道路上获得了多么辉煌的成就。革命所宣布的社会主义当初只不过是一个奋斗目标，是一个有待于解决的任务，而现在已经成为现实，成为千千万万人的创造事业，成为他们的生活。社会主义的建成，是苏维埃制度发展的主要成果，是苏联人民斗争和劳动的结果。
    社论接着说，我们国家贫穷而落后的时代老早就已经成为过去了。现在，苏联就工业发展来说，已经占世界第二位，成为强大的工业国了。由于党彻底地实行了列宁的社会主义工业化总路线，我国在空前未有的短时期内就走完了资产阶级国家要几十年、甚至好几世纪才能走完的道路。现在，我国拥有一切必要的条件，来保证在最短的历史时期内解决一项基本经济任务，——在按人口计算的工业产品生产方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    革命最复杂的任务之一——对农业实行社会主义改造的问题，在我国已经圆满地解决了。由于共产党采取了一些措施，我们的农业正在沿着急剧高涨的道路前进。
    苏维埃政权给居住在我们祖国的一切民族带来了真正的平等和自由。苏联实行的文化革命促进了科学与技术、文学与艺术的迅速繁荣，并且空前地丰富了人民的精神生活。引起普遍的惊叹和赞扬的世界头两个苏联人造地球卫星的发射，是科学技术高度发展水平的明显表现。
    社论说，伟大的十月革命思想鼓舞着为争取和平、民主和社会主义而进行斗争的各国劳动人民。中国人民革命的胜利是十月革命以后世界历史中最重大的事件。若干欧亚国家的人民也走上了社会主义的道路。全世界和平的坚强堡垒——世界社会主义体系已经形成。社会主义力量的强大在于各社会主义国家的团结、牢不可破的友谊和兄弟互助。世界社会主义体系的产生和发展是马克思列宁主义最伟大的胜利。
    社论说，在进入十月革命五十年代的时候，苏联人民在自己久经考验的领袖共产党的领导下，正在胜利地执行着制订了宏伟的共产主义建设纲领的苏共第二十次代表大会的历史性决议。苏联的社会主义是在千千万万工人、农民、知识分子的自觉、自由创造劳动的基础上产生和确立起来的。共产党和苏维埃政权在新社会的建设中之所以不断取得日新月异的伟大成就，是因为它们所依靠的力量是世界上最出色的力量：工人和农民的力量。
    社论最后说，苏联人民在社会主义建设中的一切伟大胜利，都是在高举着十月革命胜利旗帜、马克思列宁主义旗帜的、光荣的共产党的领导下获得的。共产党和苏联人民是团结一致的。在纪念十月革命四十周年的时候，工人阶级、集体农民、苏维埃知识分子更加紧密地团结在共产党的周围。他们了解，这种团结是苏维埃国家威力的可靠保证，是顺利建设共产主义的可靠保证。
