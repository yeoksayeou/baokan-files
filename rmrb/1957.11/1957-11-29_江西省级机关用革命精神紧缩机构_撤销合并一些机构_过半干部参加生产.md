    Jiangxi Provincial Organs Use Revolutionary Spirit to Streamline Institutions
    Abolish and Merge Some Institutions; Over Half of Cadres Participate in Production
    (Our newspaper, Nanchang, 28th) Jiangxi provincial Party, government, mass organizations, and enterprises are launching a surge of rectification and reform centered on further streamlining institutions, going down to the countryside, going down to the water, and going up to the mountains, to strengthen the labor front.

    On November 25th, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee jointly convened a cadre conference of nearly ten thousand people. Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and Governor, and Fang Zhichun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Governor, made reports on the issue of streamlining institutions and strengthening the labor front. They called on cadres to "go up the mountains, go down to the water," go to the labor front to train and improve themselves, and build new socialist mountain areas and new socialist rural areas. On the 26th and 27th, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee jointly convened the heads of the departments and commissions of the Provincial Party Committee, the departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee, and the provincial institutions, enterprises, and universities, to specifically study the issue of cadres "going up the mountains, going down to the countryside, and going down to the water." A heated discussion and debate unfolded at the meeting. Through debate, everyone present unanimously recognized the great significance of streamlining institutions and strengthening the labor front. Many unit leaders signed up on the spot, requesting leadership approval to go to the labor front.

    The meeting proposed that, of the existing 9,488 people in the provincial Party, government, mass organizations, institutions, and enterprises, 5,000 people would be transferred to strengthen the labor front, accounting for 53% of the current number. Among them, the Commerce and Service Departments originally had 2,030 administrative management personnel. This time, 1,630 people will be transferred, accounting for more than 80% of the original number. The departments and commissions of the Provincial Party Committee plan to transfer 200 to 500 people, accounting for 40% of the original number.

    In order to achieve the above requirements, the meeting initially proposed the following main measures:

    (1) Abolish and merge some institutions. Provincial Party Committee organs: abolish the Finance and Trade Department and the Culture and Education Department; the Transportation Department and the Industry Department are merged into the Industry and Transportation Department. Government system: abolish the Provincial Meteorological Bureau, its work is transferred to the management of the Agricultural Department; abolish the office of the Provincial Science Work Committee, its work is concurrently managed by the General Office of the Provincial People's Committee; abolish the Service Department, its work is transferred to the unified management of the Commerce Department; abolish the specialized companies under the Commerce, Health, and Foreign Trade Departments, their work is directly managed by each department; the Highway and Shipping Departments are merged into the Transportation Department; the Culture Bureau and the Education Department are merged into the Culture and Education Department; abolish the Provincial Construction Committee, its work is managed by the Urban Construction Bureau; the Provincial Materials Supply Bureau is merged with the Materials Supply Section of the Provincial Planning Committee; abolish the Forest Industry Bureau, its work is transferred to the management of the Forestry Department.

    (2) Reduce layers, simplify institutions, and minimize staffing levels. Currently, some departments and commissions, departments and bureaus are over-staffed with leaders, generally having four to five tiers. This time, it is initially determined that, in principle, only two tiers will be staffed. Units with fewer tasks can only have one tier, and units with more burdensome tasks will have no more than three tiers. The internal organs of the departments and commissions of the Provincial Party Committee, the departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee, and various people's organizations will only have two levels: department (bureau/commission) and section, generally without offices.

    (3) Substantially reduce service personnel in the organs. Abolish the staffing of cooks, all organ canteens will be run as enterprises; abolish privately used public servants, and reduce public public servants to the lowest limit; improve the use of vehicles, and reduce the number of vehicles and drivers in the organs.

    In the past two days, in the process of rectification and reform, all cadres have been mobilized to conduct a major debate on issues such as whether the organs can be further streamlined, how to streamline them, whether the labor front needs to be strengthened, whether cadres should take the lead in strengthening the labor front, whether cadres participating in labor production is a "waste of talent," as well as the difficulties that may be encountered in strengthening the labor front and how to overcome these difficulties.

    The more than 5,000 cadres transferred from the provincial organs will go to Jinggang Mountain, Wugong Mountain, and other seven large mountains to establish forestry bases and five large-scale comprehensive agricultural, forestry, fishing, and animal husbandry reclamation farms. Each forestry base and reclamation farm will be assigned 300 to 500 people, and each unit will be equipped with three to four department-level cadres.

    江西省级机关用革命精神紧缩机构
    撤销合并一些机构　过半干部参加生产
    本报南昌28日电　江西省级党、政、群机关和事业、企业部门，正在掀起一个以继续紧缩机构，下乡、下水、上山，加强劳动战线为中心的边整边改高潮。
    11月25日，省委、省人民委员会联合召开了近万人的干部大会，中共江西省委书记、省长邵式平，省委书记、副省长方志纯作了关于紧缩机构加强劳动战线问题的报告，号召干部“上山、下水”，到劳动战线上去，锻炼和提高自己，建设社会主义的新山区、新农村。26、27两日，省委、省人民委员会又联合召集了省委各部、委，省人委各厅、局，以及省级各事业、企业、大专学校的负责人，专门研究了干部“上山、下乡、下水”的问题，会上展开了热烈的讨论和辩论。通过辩论，所有到会的人，一致认识到紧缩机构，加强劳动战线的重大意义，许多单位的负责人当场报名，请求领导上批准到劳动战线上去。
    这次会议上提出：省级党、政、群、事业、企业机关，在现有的九千四百八十八人中，抽调五千人加强劳动战线，占现有人数的53％。其中：商业、服务两个厅原有行政管理人员二千零三十人，这次将抽调一千六百三十人，占原有人数80％以上。省委各部委计划抽调二百到五百人，占原有人数40％。
    为了达到上述要求，会上初步提出以下几项主要措施：
    （一）撤销、合并一些机构。省委机关：撤销财贸部、文教部；交通部与工业部合并为工业交通部。政府系统：撤销省气象局，其工作划归农业厅管理；撤销省科学工作委员会的办公机构，其工作划归省人委办公厅兼管；撤销服务厅，其工作划归商业厅统一管理；撤销商业、卫生、外贸等厅所属各专业公司，其工作分别划归各厅直接管理；公路、航运两厅合并为交通厅；文化局和教育厅合并为文教厅；撤销省建设委员会，其工作由城市建设局管理；省物资供应局，与省计划委员会物资供应处合并；撤销森林工业局，其工作划归林业厅管理。
    （二）减少层次，简化机构，尽量减少人员编制。现在有些部委、厅局领导干部配备的过多，一般的都有四线到五线。这次初步确定，原则上只配备两线，工作任务较少的单位，也可以只配备一线，工作任务较繁重的单位，最多不超过三线。省委各部委，省人民委员会各厅局，各人民团体的内部机构，只设部（厅、局）科两级，一般不设处。
    （三）大量减少机关的服务人员。取消炊事员的编制，所有的机关食堂一律企业化；取消私人使用的公务员，把公用公务员也减至最低的限度；改进汽车使用办法，减少机关的汽车和司机。
    近两天来，各机关在边整边改工作中，发动全体干部，就机关能否再紧缩、如何紧缩、劳动战线是否需要加强、干部应不应该带头去加强劳动战线、干部参加劳动生产是否“大材小用”等问题，以及在加强劳动战线中可能遇到的困难和如何克服这些困难的问题，进行大辩论。
    省级机关抽调的这五千多名干部，将分别到井岗山、武功山等七个大山，建立林业基地和五个大型的农、林、渔、牧综合垦殖场。每个林业基地和垦殖场分配三百到五百人，每个单位都配备厅级干部三人到四人。
