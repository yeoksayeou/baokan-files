    Transferring some apprentices to do odd jobs is in line with the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift.

    As everyone knows, many people in our factory are currently idle. Comrades who have nothing to do will naturally feel pain in their spirits. For the leadership to solve this problem by transferring you to do odd jobs should be considered a great happiness. Young people do not consider problems comprehensively and are most prone to losing their way.

    Now, many leading cadres in our country are participating in physical labor. In order to save funds for the country, what's wrong with transferring you to do ordinary work?

    把幸福当作痛苦  年轻人思索欠周
    抽调一部分徒工去做勤杂工作，这是合乎勤俭建国的精神的。
    大家都知道，我们厂目前有很多人呆着没事做。没事做的同志，精神上当然会感到痛苦。领导上为了解决这个问题，调你们去做勤杂工，应该认为是莫大的幸福。年轻人考虑问题不全面，最易迷失方向。
    现在，我们国家的很多领导干部都参加了体力劳动，为了给国家节约资金，调你们去做普通工，怎么不行呢？
