    Workshop Floor Sweeper
    Fan Yiben, Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill
    The whistle hasn't blown for work yet!
    You're pushing the bristle brush rake, walking the shop floor.
    In the past, you wouldn't enter the workshop even a minute early,
    Why are you here so early today?
    I remember on the eve of the rectification campaign,
    The floor was covered with white fluffs and sizing powder,
    The foreman asked you to sweep it again,
    You said, "Didn't I just sweep?"
    Now all that is water under the bridge,
    As long as there are fluffs on the floor, you start your rounds,
    The black waves roll under the brush rake,
    Shining brightly on the path you've swept!
    In the past, sweeping was like a whirlwind,
    Causing floating fluffs and dust to fly onto people's heads;
    Today your movements are so gentle,
    Not letting a grain of dust slip away from your feet!
    You push the workshop waste together;
    Then carefully separate it:
    White fluffs, short fibers, dust, screws…
    You say: “How can I just throw it all away as waste!”
    Suddenly a row of spindles stops spinning,
    The deputy foreman, sweating, runs towards the warehouse,
    You stopped him in his tracks:
    "Need screws? I have them here!"
    The deputy foreman surprisingly opens the iron box in your hand,
    Selecting one from several hundred screws!
    Tightly screwing it on with a screwdriver,
    The spindles that stopped spinning are turning again!
    The deputy foreman asks with a smiling face:
    "Where did you pick up so many screws?"
    "From the garbage heap, from under the machine tools…"
    "Who told you to pick them up?"
    "The clear spring of rectification washed my heart clean,
    Our factory is a big machine,
    I am a screw on the machine!"

    车间扫地工	北京国棉一厂　范以本
    开车的铃还没有响呢！
    你推着牛毛刷耙在车道上走动。
    往日上班差一分钟也不进车间，
    今日你为什么来得这样早？
    我记得在整风的前夕，
    地上落满白色的飞花和浆粉，
    工长叫你再清扫一遍，
    你说“我不是刚刚扫过。”
    如今这一切已是流去的溪水，
    只要地上有飞花你就打起巡回，
    刷耙下翻滚着黑色的浪花，
    在你走过的车道上闪耀着亮光！
    往日扫地像打旋风一般，
    闹得浮花尘土飞上人头；
    今天你的动作是那么轻轻，
    不让一粒灰土从你脚下溜走！
    你把车间废物推在一起；
    又小心翼翼地将它分开：
    白花、短绒、尘土、螺丝……
    你说：“我怎能把它们全当废物抛去！”
    突然一排纱锭停止了飞旋，
    副工长冒着汗往仓库跑去，
    是你拦住了他的去路：
    “要螺丝吗？我这里有！”
    副工长惊奇地打开你手上的铁盒，
    从几百只螺丝里挑选了一只！
    用螺旋刀紧紧地把它绞上，
    那停止转动的纱锭又飞转起来！
    副工长笑眉细眼地问：
    “这么多螺丝从那里拣来？”
    “从垃圾堆里，从机床脚下……”
    “是谁叫你拣的？”
    “整风的清泉洗刷了我的心，
    咱们厂是一台大机器，
    我是机器上的一只螺丝钉！”
