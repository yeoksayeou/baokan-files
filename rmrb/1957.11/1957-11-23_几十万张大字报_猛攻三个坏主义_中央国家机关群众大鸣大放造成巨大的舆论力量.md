Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd Dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporter Gong Ce reports: In recent days, a tidal wave of unrestrained airing of views, spearheaded by hundreds of thousands of big-character posters, is burning fiercely and universally within the central state organs.

    Based on the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (Third Plenary Session), the Party organizations of the central state organs have resolutely relied on the masses, and in the recent half-month or so, have widely launched a mass movement of exposure, criticism, and suggestions, rapidly forming a fiery high tide of unrestrained airing of views. This mass unrestrained airing of views has created a situation in which the subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism of the leading organs are nakedly exposed before the masses, forming a powerful force of public opinion, enabling thorough rectification to possess unprecedentedly favorable conditions.

    Walking into any organ, one sees big-character posters everywhere, truly colorful and extraordinarily lively. According to statistics as of November 15th, more than 220,000 big-character posters have already been posted in sixty ministerial-level units of the central state organs, and more than 14,900 discussion meetings have been held, through which the masses have put forward more than 380,000 opinions. During this period, 78% of the department and bureau-level units entered the high tide of unrestrained airing of views, and some other units are also rapidly entering the high tide of unrestrained airing of views within these two or three days.

    In the unrestrained airing of views, the masses have put forward a large number of sharp and practical criticisms targeting the three major -isms of the leading organs, especially the most opinions on leadership style, policies, institutional systems, and living welfare. According to statistics from thirty-six ministerial-level units, the masses put forward more than 110,000 opinions in these areas, accounting for 75% of the total number of opinions. The exposure of many vivid facts proves that as long as the majority of the masses are trusted and the masses are fully mobilized, they can put forward many extremely valuable opinions. A big-character poster in the Ministry of Communications wrote: "Generals are not in harmony, the three evils increase," criticizing the disunity between some vice-ministers and between directors and deputy directors of this ministry. This problem had been helped solved by Wang Shoudao and others in the past, but everyone still had ideological problems. The disunity of the leaders became a key issue affecting the work of this ministry. For a long time, they did not dare to face it squarely. After the big-character poster openly put forward the criticism, the masses unanimously expressed their support, which prompted the leading cadres to seriously consider a solution in front of the masses. After the mass criticism movement was launched, some opinions were sharp; but it made the leaders sweat, which was of great benefit. Almost all the leaders of the Ministry of Communications were criticized by the masses. A big-character poster in this ministry sharply criticized the bureaucratic style of a vice-minister in charge of the work of the Legal Affairs Office. This vice-minister had been in charge of the Legal Affairs Office for one year and two months. The author of the big-character poster requested that this vice-minister take a "business examination" with three questions: "Choose any two questions to answer": "(1) Have you been to the Legal Affairs Office? (2) How many times have you asked us to report on our work? (3) Which regulations is the Legal Affairs Office currently drafting?" This big-character poster was a great satire of the bureaucratic style, but it was a positive and constructive opinion. The masses supported this kind of big-character poster, and the criticized also supported this kind of big-character poster.

    In the unrestrained airing of views, various organs heavily criticized the phenomenon of bloated organizations and overstaffing. In the past few years, the central state organs have undergone several rounds of streamlining, but the effects have always been small, and the size of many organs has become larger and larger. This situation has greatly fueled the bureaucratic style of the leading organs. Judging from the current unrestrained airing of views, the phenomenon of unreasonable organization and personnel is a relatively common problem. Many organs' masses put forward: "The food of three people can be eaten by five people, but the work of three people should not be done by five people." The sundries company affiliated to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the masses criticized the "five-too-many" phenomenon in the agency: "Too many personnel, too many managers (five managers), too many directors (some departments have up to four directors), too many first-class clerks, too many leaves." The critic made a statistic that in September, the number of people taking leave in the entire company accounted for more than 40% of the total number of staff, and the leave time totaled more than 1,700 hours. In addition, some people criticized this company for having a situation of "two on the surface and six in reality." "Two on the surface" means that there are only two levels of managers and directors on the surface, but in reality, six levels have been formed: manager, assistant manager, commissioner, director, assistant director, and group leader. This overlapping level is the biggest breeding ground for bureaucratic style and makes many people have nothing to do. The wall of the Ministry of Communications published a "Xiao Jin's Work Diary". According to the diary, only one day of the week was relatively busy, and the remaining six days had only half an hour or an hour of work, or nothing to do all day. Someone from the China National Import and Export Corporation wrote a twenty-line poem on a big-character poster to criticize the phenomenon of overstaffing, which wrote: "Reading during office hours, newspapers and magazines in hand, cigarettes and tea accompany meals, idle chatter and noisy sounds... Eradicate the three evils and rectify the work style, thoroughly rectify and have determination, vigorously advance, and build socialism quickly." In big-character posters and discussion meetings, this unreasonable phenomenon was attacked by broad public opinion. They demanded that the organization be resolutely tightened, cadres be transferred to lower levels, and do not be "capable retirees." These situations have created an extremely favorable situation of "must be changed" and "must be changed" in the central state organs. Many heads of organs said: Relying on the masses and giving play to the wisdom of the masses, problems that have been difficult to solve for several years can be solved this time.

    The large number of facts exposed by mass criticism proves that overcoming the subjectivism and bureaucratic style in the leadership work of central-level organs has a significant impact on national work. The masses of the China National Chemical Raw Materials Corporation and the China National Medicines Corporation exposed that in the high tide of agricultural collectivization, the two companies demanded to support agricultural collectivization from the business work of their units. However, they did not conduct in-depth and comprehensive investigations and studies, and only emphasized that the rural areas after collectivization had "great potential." They manufactured millions of carbide lamps and health care medicine boxes according to the number of cooperatives, preparing to promote them universally to cooperatives, hoping to fully promote carbide lamps in areas with a foundation, and hoping that every cooperative would have a health care medicine box. The results of the implementation proved that their subjective wishes did not fully conform to the actual situation, especially because farmers demanded diligence and thrift in running cooperatives, these commodities were heavily overstocked, causing great losses to state property. Some big-character posters in the State Planning Commission criticized the basic construction of some institutions of higher learning, which have had relatively serious waste phenomena for several years, and the leaders have only now discovered this problem, which has failed to avoid losses to the state in a timely manner. The masses of the Ministry of Commerce exposed many commodity overstocking and waste situations caused by the subjectivism and bureaucracy of the leadership. As for the unreasonable situation of commodity duplication and reciprocal transportation, it is even more frequent. The masses pointed out that especially the central economic departments, they have power and money, and slight negligence in their work will bring serious losses to the country. These departments must thoroughly overcome the three -isms with a high degree of responsibility to the people.

    At present, the unrestrained airing of views in the central state organs has achieved great results, but it is by no means "almost finished." The facts of many organs prove that the wisdom of the masses still has great potential to be tapped. Especially since the cadres of the central state organs directly participate in the management of national affairs, as long as the masses are deeply mobilized and everyone is motivated to use their brains, more criticisms and suggestions that make important contributions to the country can be unearthed. In the unrestrained airing of views, some leading cadres are still "not used to" the way of putting up big-character posters. They do not advocate, do not encourage, and some even impose various restrictions. However, the vivid facts of many units prove that big-character posters are one of the best main forms of unrestrained airing of views. Big-character posters can openly expose shortcomings and can arouse the power of public opinion. Its special role cannot be replaced by other forms of unrestrained airing of views.

    Currently, the pressing central issue facing the rectification movement of the central state organs is how to vigorously carry out rectification after the unrestrained airing of views, and how to conscientiously and responsibly handle these thousands of clues and thousands of valuable opinions put forward by the masses. The unrestrained airing of views is not the goal, it only creates favorable conditions for rectification. Many organs are not good at properly arranging rectification work, some heads of organs have insufficient understanding of rectification, and some have even adopted a bureaucratic attitude to overcome bureaucracy, and a relatively serious formalism style has been shown in the rectification. Overcoming these situations and putting rectification first will further encourage the masses to air their views and promote the movement forward.

    To make the rectification work keep up with the development of the situation, the situation in many organs proves that it is not enough to simply organize the masses to carry out special rectification by grasping a few key issues by the leadership. The leadership must simultaneously with the mass airing of views, seize the general rectification, and promote the airing of views with rectification. Otherwise, it may cause problems and opinions that could have been rectified immediately to be accumulated and delayed, thus frustrating the enthusiasm of the masses to continue to air their views. To make the general rectification work implement the mass line and carry out in-depth universally, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to solve various problems that can be solved at present in pieces and in batches; especially to closely combine socialist ideological education in the rectification, and through the improvement of shortcomings, everyone can gain something in their thinking, improve their awareness, and be educated. To do a good job in rectification, the key issue is still the determination of the leadership.

    几十万张大字报　猛攻三个坏主义
    中央国家机关群众大鸣大放造成巨大的舆论力量
    新华社22日讯　新华社记者宫策报道：这几天以来，以数十万张大字报为主的鸣放热潮，正像熊熊火焰一样在中央国家机关内普遍燃烧起来。
    根据中共八届三中全会的决议，中央国家机关的党组织坚决地依靠群众，在最近的半个多月以内，广泛地掀起了群众性的揭露、批评和建议运动，迅速地形成了火热的大鸣大放高潮。这种群众性的大鸣大放造成了一种形势：领导机关的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义等毛病，赤裸裸地暴露在群众面前，形成了强大的舆论力量，使彻底整改具备了前所未有的有利条件。
    随便走到那个机关，只见大字报满庭满院，真是五光十色，热闹非凡。到11月15日统计，在中央国家机关六十个部一级的单位中，已经贴出了二十二万多张大字报，举行了一万四千九百多次座谈会，群众通过这些方式提出了三十八万多条意见。在这个时期内，有78％的司局一级单位进入了鸣放高潮，其他一些单位也都在这三两天之内迅速地进入了鸣放高潮。
    在大鸣大放中，群众针对领导机关的三大主义提出了大量的、尖锐的、切实的批评，特别是对领导作风、方针政策、机构体制和生活福利等方面的意见最多。根据三十六个部一级单位的统计，群众在这些方面提出了十一万多条意见，占意见总数的75％。揭露的许多生动的事实证明，只要相信群众的多数、充分地发动群众，他们便能提出许多极为宝贵的意见。交通部一张大字报上写着：“将相不和，三害增多”，批评这个部的一些副部长之间及司局长之间的不团结现象。这个问题过去曾由王首道等帮助解决过，但是大家思想上仍然存在问题，领导人的不团结成为影响这个部的工作的关键性问题，长期以来他们不大敢正视它，大字报公开提出了批评以后，群众一致表示支持，这就促使了领导干部不得不在群众面前认真地考虑解决。群众性的批评运动开展以后，有些意见是尖锐的；但是它使领导者出一身汗，大有好处。交通部几乎所有的领导人都被群众提出了批评。这个部有一张大字报尖锐地批评一位分工领导法律室工作的副部长的官僚主义作风，这位副部长分工领导法律室已经一年零二个月，大字报作者要求对这位副部长举行一次“业务考试”，考题共有三个，“任选两题作答”：“（1）你到过法律室没有？（2）你几次叫我们汇报过工作？（3）法律室正在草拟那个法规？”这张大字报对官僚主义作风是很大的讽刺，但是它是积极的建设性的意见，群众支持这样的大字报，被批评者也支持这样的大字报。
    在鸣放中，各机关大量地批评了机构臃肿、人浮于事的现象。过去几年来，中央国家机关数次精简，始终效果不大，很多机关的摊子反而越“简”越大。这种情况大大地助长了领导机关的官僚主义作风。从目前鸣放的情况看来，机构和人员不合理的现象是比较普遍存在的一个问题。许多机关的群众提出：“三个人的饭可以五个人吃，但是三个人的工作不应该五个人干。”对外贸易部所属的杂品公司，群众批评机关的“五多”现象：“人员多、经理多（五个经理）、处长多（有的处多至四个处长）、一等科员多、请假多。”批评者作了一个统计，9月份全公司请假的人占工作人员总数的40％以上，请假时间共有一千七百多个小时。另外，还有人批评这个公司有“明二暗六”的情况，“明二”就是表面上是经理和处长两级，实际上却形成了六级，即：经理、经理助理、专员、处长、处长助理、组长。这种重叠的层次，是官僚主义作风最大的温床，并且使许多人无事可做。交通部的墙上公布了一篇“小金的工作日记”，日记所记载的一周时间内，只有一天工作比较忙些，其余六天有的一天只有半小时或一小时的工作，有的整天无事。中国进出口公司有人在大字报上写了二十行诗来批评人浮于事的现象，其中写道：“办公时间兼阅览，报纸杂志拿上手，香烟清茶伴进餐，闲话扯谈喧哗声。……铲除三害整作风，彻底整改有决心，朝气蓬勃迈大步，社会主义速建成。”在大字报和座谈会上，这种不合理的现象遭到广大舆论的抨击，他们要求坚决紧缩机构、下放干部、不要做“有能力的休养员”。这些情况就在中央国家机关内造成了一种“势在必改”、“不改不行”的极为有利的形势，许多机关的负责人说：依靠了群众，发挥了群众的智慧，几年来难以解决的问题这次可以解决了。
    经过群众性的批评所揭露出来的大量事实证明，在中央一级机关克服领导工作上的主观主义和官僚主义作风，对全国工作有着重大的影响。中国化工原料公司和中国医药公司的群众揭露，在农业合作化高潮中，两个公司要求从本单位的业务工作上来支援农业合作化，但是他们没有作深入全面的调查研究，只强调合作化后农村“潜力很大”，他们按照合作社的数目制造了成百万的电石灯和保健药箱，准备向合作社普遍推销，希望在有基础的地区全面推广电石灯，希望社社有保健药箱。实行的结果证明，他们的主观愿望同实际情况并不完全符合，特别由于农民要求勤俭办社，这些商品被大量的积压，给国家的财产造成了很大的损失。国家计划委员会有的大字报批评一些高等学校的基本建设，几年来一直存在比较严重的浪费现象，而领导上直到现在才发现这个问题，这就未能及时使国家避免损失。商业部群众揭露了很多由于领导上的主观主义、官僚主义而造成的商品积压和浪费情况，至于商品的重复和相向运输的不合理情况，更是经常出现的事情。群众指出，特别是中央主管经济的部门，它们有权有钱，工作上略有疏忽就会给国家带来严重的损失。这些部门必须以高度的对人民负责的精神来彻底克服三个主义。
    目前，中央国家机关的鸣放已经取得了很大的成绩，但是绝不是“鸣放得差不多了”。许多机关的事实证明，群众的智慧还有很大的潜力可挖，特别是由于中央国家机关的干部直接参与全国事务的管理，只要深入发动群众，使人人都开动脑筋，就可以挖掘出更多的对国家有重要贡献的批评和建议。在鸣放中，有些领导干部还“不习惯”于出大字报的方式，他们不提倡，不鼓励，有的甚至加以种种限制。但是，许多单位生动的事实证明，大字报是鸣放最好的主要形式之一，大字报能够公开地暴露缺点，能够激起舆论的力量，它的特殊作用是其他鸣放形式所不能代替的。
    当前，中央国家机关的整风运动面临的迫切的中心问题是在大鸣大放之后，如何大力进行整改，如何认真负责地处理群众提出的这些千头万绪的成千成万条宝贵意见。大鸣大放不是目的，它只为整改创造了有利的条件。许多机关还不善于适当地安排整改工作，有的机关负责人对整改还认识不足，甚至有的仍然采取了官僚主义的态度来克服官僚主义，整改中表现了比较严重的形式主义作风。克服这些情况，把整改放在第一位，就会进一步鼓励群众鸣放，推动运动前进。
    要使整改工作跟上形势的发展，许多机关的情况证明，仅仅由领导上抓住几个重点问题组织群众进行专题整改，这是不够的，领导上必须与群众鸣放的同时，抓紧一般整改，以整改推动鸣放。否则，就可能使本来能够立刻整改的问题和意见被积压和拖延下来，因而就会挫折群众继续鸣放的热情。要使一般整改工作贯彻群众路线，普遍深入地进行，这就需要发动群众分片、分批地解决目前即可能解决的各种问题；特别要在整改中紧密地结合社会主义思想教育，通过对缺点的改进，使每个人在思想上都能有所收获，提高觉悟，受到教育。要把整改工作作好，关键问题仍然在于领导的决心。
