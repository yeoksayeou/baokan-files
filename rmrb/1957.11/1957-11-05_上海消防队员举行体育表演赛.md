Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 2nd: Over four hundred firefighters from Shanghai participated in a spectacular sports performance competition at the Hongkou Stadium on November 1st, riding in thirty-one various types of fire engines.

The thirteen competition events were all related to firefighting duties. Some involved firefighters wearing raincoats, rubber boots, helmets, carrying axes, fire hoses, etc., and competing in running. Others involved a 100-meter sprint where the firefighters started by lying down on the ground, representing them sleeping in bed at night. When a fire alarm suddenly sounded, they had to put on their firefighting gear, take their firefighting tools, and then start running towards the finish line. The mobile ladder fifty-meter distance water tower exercise was the most interesting event. Firefighters pushed the mobile ladder truck for fifty meters, then immediately stopped it and raised the ladder on the truck. A firefighter then quickly climbed to the top of the ladder. This was a simulated dangerous action of going to a tall building to rescue people and extinguish a fire.

As a result of the competition, the 5th District Team and the China Petroleum Corporation Shanghai Purchasing Station Fire Brigade won the championships respectively.

After the competition, the firefighters also held eight firefighting technical demonstrations. The comprehensive firefighting tactical performance fully demonstrated the development of Shanghai's firefighting capabilities.

Shanghai uses wireless equipment for fire alarms and firefighting command, and the requirements for rescuing people and extinguishing fires are calculated in seconds. According to statistics from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, fire losses and casualties in Shanghai in the eight years since liberation have decreased by 50% compared to the total from 1946 to 1949.

    上海消防队员举行体育表演赛
    新华社上海2日电　上海四百多个消防员1日搭乘三十一辆各种型式的消防车，在虹口体育场举行了一次精采的体育表演比赛。
    比赛的十三个项目，都是结合着消防业务进行的。有的是由消防员穿着雨衣、胶靴，带着钢盔、斧子、水龙带等，比赛跑步。有的是在一百公尺跑步中，起步前队员们睡倒在地上，表示夜间他们已经睡在床上，突然遇到火警，要穿上消防衣，带着灭火工具，然后出发奔向终点。摇梯五十公尺距离水塔操是比赛中最有趣的项目。消防员们推动摇梯车奔跑五十公尺以后，马上把它停住，并且把车上的摇梯升高，一个消防员立即迅速地爬到梯顶。这是一个到高楼去救火救人的惊险行动。
    比赛结果，第五区队和中国石油公司上海采购站消防队，分别获得了冠军。
    比赛以后，消防员们还举行了八项消防技术表演。在消防战术综合表演中，充分显示了上海消防事业的发展。
    上海对火灾的报警和消防指挥都由无线电设备联络，对救人和灭火速度的要求，都以秒来计算。据市公安局统计，上海解放八年来的火灾损失伤亡，已比1946年到1949年三年的总和减少了50％。
