    Doctor Vetrova
    One cold, drizzly morning last autumn, Doctor Vetrova, who worked at the Zamiin-Uud Station Hospital in the Mongolian People's Republic, received a call after her night shift from the Zamiin-Uud stationmaster, informing her that Wei Jinhua, the wife of Tian Lintang, a Chinese employee at the Erenhot station, was experiencing a difficult childbirth. Without resting, she immediately set off. After a careful examination, she determined that Wei Jinhua's child had died in the womb and that surgery was necessary in Zamiin-Uud. People quickly arranged for Wei Jinhua to obtain exit手续 (exit formalities). At this time, Doctor Vetrova had been awake all night, was very tired, and shivering with cold. When offered breakfast, she refused, saying to others: I have no right to leave the patient to eat until she is out of danger. Thus, she accompanied the mother every step of the way to Zamiin-Uud.
    After a consultation in Zamiin-Uud, it was decided to send her by special car to Sainshand, two hundred and forty kilometers away, for treatment. Despite not having rested for a day and a night, having eaten very little, and being extremely hungry and tired, Doctor Vetrova insisted on taking the mother to Sainshand and settling her in.
    Some days later, Wei Jinhua returned healthily from Sainshand to Erenhot. When she passed through Zamiin-Uud, Doctor Vetrova, hearing the news, arrived at the station early to wait. When she saw Wei Jinhua return so healthy, it was as if she were seeing her own sister returning. She was so happy that she embraced her again and again. Wei Jinhua, in her arms, was moved to tears and could not say a word.

### 维特罗娃大夫

    维特罗娃大夫
    去年秋天的一个早晨，下着冷森森的小雨。在蒙古人民共和国扎门乌德车站医院服务的维特罗娃大夫刚下夜班，接到了扎门乌德站长告诉她二连站的中国员工田林堂的妻子魏金花难产的电话。她一刻也没休息，马上动身赶来了。经过仔细检查，弄清楚魏金花的孩子已经死在腹中，必须到扎门乌德去动手术。人们于是赶快给魏金花办出国手续。这时维特罗娃大夫已一夜没休息，很疲倦，冷得发抖。请她吃早饭，说什么也不去；她对别人说：在病人没有摆脱危险的时候，我是没有权利离开病人去吃饭的。就这样，她一步不离地把产妇送到扎门乌德。
    在扎门乌德会诊后，决定用专车送到离那里有二百四十公里的三音山达城去治疗，于是维特罗娃大夫尽管一天一夜没休息，只吃了很少一点东西，饥饿疲倦已极，但她坚持把产妇送到三音山达安置好。
    过了些日子，魏金花健康地由三音山达回二连，经过扎门乌德，维特罗娃听到这消息，很早就到车站上来等候。当她看到魏金花这样健康地回来就像看到自己亲姊妹回来一样，高兴得一次又一次地去拥抱她，魏金花这时在她怀抱里感动得哭起来，一句话也说不出来。
