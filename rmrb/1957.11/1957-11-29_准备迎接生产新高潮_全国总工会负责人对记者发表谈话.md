Xinhua News Agency, November 26th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Luo Feng reports: A nationwide, sustained new upsurge in industrial production is about to arrive. In this new upsurge, what issues should the broad masses of workers, especially trade union workers, pay attention to, and what work should they do well? Today, a responsible person from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions answered this question in a conversation with reporters.

The responsible person from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions first analyzed the current situation of the rectification movement in factories and mines, and pointed out: After the masses of workers express their opinions freely, a high tide of rectification and improvement will inevitably appear; along with resolutely improving the work, a new production high tide will inevitably appear. Many materials show that after the rectification movement was launched in various factories and mines, new records in production and construction of the worker masses continued to emerge, labor discipline was greatly strengthened, attendance rates were unprecedentedly high, and rationalization proposals were more numerous than at any time before. Many major problems that could not be solved in production in the past have now been gradually resolved; therefore, many factories and mines have comprehensively and over-fulfilled monthly and annual plans. This is a new situation, which shows that a nationwide new production high tide is gradually forming. In fact, many places across the country have already begun to experience new high tides. We must pay sufficient attention to these new situations; we must resolutely carry out the rectification movement to the end; we must promote and lead the early arrival of the new production high tide proactively and with foresight. At present, it is particularly necessary to prevent phenomena such as a lack of enthusiasm for the new high tide, indifference to new things, or thinking that a production high tide cannot occur simultaneously with the rectification and improvement high tide, as well as waiting for the new high tide to arrive. The responsible person said that the general rule is that the more fully the masses are mobilized, the more thoroughly opinions are voiced, and the more that 90% or more of the opinions that workers want to raise are raised; if the enterprise leadership is determined to resolutely improve the work, especially by promptly improving the shortcomings in production management based on the reasonable opinions of the masses, the enthusiasm of the worker masses will rise accordingly, and a new production high tide will form. In the past, what exactly was restricting the further development of the enthusiasm and creativity of the worker masses in enterprises? It was mainly that the leadership of the enterprises did not analyze the overall situation of the enterprises well, did not frequently and systematically study the problems existing in production management, and even more did not rely on the worker masses to solve these problems in a timely manner; this bureaucratic style of work hindered the development of enterprise production. After the rectification movement is launched, if this style of work is corrected more thoroughly and more promptly, then the new production high tide will come earlier and more smoothly. At the same time, it should also be seen that due to the different times at which the rectification movement is carried out in various places and the different specific conditions of various factories and mines, the manifestations of the production high tide and the degree to which it is formed will also be very different. Under normal circumstances, it often first appears in a unit where a certain movement is carried out more deeply and thoroughly and where the masses' minds are mobilized more fully, and then gradually spreads to the entire enterprise and region. In general, it is first driven by a small number of advanced workers, and then becomes a mass movement of the majority. The law of movement development is always from the few to the many, from the partial to the whole, from incomplete to complete.

The responsible person emphasized that to promote the arrival of this high tide, in the spirit of ensuring that both rectification and production are not neglected, we should conscientiously do meticulous organizational work and the following aspects of mass production work:
    (1) Pay close attention to the various creative initiatives of the worker masses in production, and support these initiatives so that they blossom and bear fruit. We must be good at using typical examples to promote the overall situation, and use the leadership method of using points to drive the surface. After this rectification, whether a leader can discover and attach importance to various new affairs in a timely manner will be an important criterion for measuring whether he has truly overcome the bureaucratic style of work.
    (2) Actively carry out mass rationalization proposal activities. The responsible person said that, judging from the current situation in some enterprises, mass rationalization proposals are very active. Workers often implement the suggestions they make themselves. Therefore, in the new production high tide, we should continue to rely on the worker masses and boldly mobilize them to solve various problems they raise that can be solved. Now, some enterprises summarize the opinions voiced by the masses into several issues and organize mass thematic discussions, or use the method of proposing topics to mobilize the masses to solve them, with very good results. Some enterprises also have very good methods of widely using mass production meetings and technical research associations to organize and mobilize workers to solve problems. However, for major production technology and other issues, enterprise leaders need to grasp them personally and cannot handle them lightly. The responsible person also said that in the future, material rewards for the worker masses should be better combined with political and ideological education. We cannot neglect the necessary material reward work because of the high political enthusiasm of the worker masses.
    (3) Pay attention to summarizing and promoting various advanced experiences in a timely manner. To organize a production high tide means to make the broad masses of workers learn from the advanced, and to raise our production speed to a new level. To make production and construction work quickly reach an advanced level, we can only vigorously promote advanced experience. The scope of promoting advanced experience should include popularizing adopted rationalization proposals and organizing technical mutual aid activities for workers to learn each other's skills. In addition to paying attention to promoting the advanced experience of their own units, all localities should also actively learn from and promote advanced Soviet experience in light of China's actual conditions.
    (4) We must continue to do a good job of relying on veteran workers. China's veteran workers generally have a longer period of revolutionary training and practical experience, stronger organization and discipline, higher political awareness, and richer production experience. Facts have proven that they are not only the backbone force in politics, but also the backbone force in production; we should give full play to their role. We should rely on them to help and unite young workers; we should educate young workers to learn from veteran workers. We must also actively give play to the role of engineering and technical personnel and staff, and enable them to cooperate closely with the worker masses to do a good job in production.
    (5) In order to keep the labor enthusiasm of the worker masses constantly full and continuously improve, we must vigorously organize socialist competitions. Through competition, we can better guide the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers to the goal of striving to comprehensively over-fulfill the national plan. Through competition, the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift can truly become the guide to action for the broad masses of workers; we must establish a moral fashion of hard struggle, diligence and thrift among the broad masses of workers. At the same time, in the competition, we should also pay close attention to improving product quality and ensuring safe production.

The responsible person repeatedly stated in the conversation that this new high tide of industrial production is by no means a short-term phenomenon, and its important significance cannot be ignored. It will inevitably create more favorable conditions for the outstanding completion of the national plan for next year on the basis of completing the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and over-fulfilling it, thereby over-fulfilling the second five-year plan; it will provide a strong guarantee for building our country's socialist cause more, faster, better and more economically.

    准备迎接生产新高潮
    全国总工会负责人对记者发表谈话
    据新华社26日讯　新华社记者骆风报道：一个全国规模的、持久的工业生产新高潮就要到来了。在这个新高潮中，广大的职工群众特别是工会工作者，应当注意什么问题，做好哪些工作呢？今天中华全国总工会负责人在和记者的谈话中，答复了这个问题。
    中华全国总工会负责人首先分析了当前厂矿企业的整风运动情况，并且指出：在工人群众的大鸣大放以后，必然会出现整改高潮；随着狠狠地改进工作，必然会出现新的生产高潮。许多材料说明，各地厂矿企业在开展整风运动以后，职工群众在生产建设上的新纪录不断出现，劳动纪律大大加强，出勤率空前提高，合理化建议比以前任何时期都多；许多企业从前在生产上不能解决的重大问题，现在逐渐得到了解决；因而很多厂矿都全面和超额完成了月份和年度计划。这是一种新的情况，它说明了一个全国规模的新的生产高潮正在逐渐形成。事实上，全国已经有不少地方开始出现了新的高潮。我们对于这些新的情况必须有足够的重视；必须坚决把整风运动进行到底；必须有远见地、主动地促进和领导新的生产高潮早日到来。目前特别需要防止发生对于新高潮缺乏热情，对于新事物熟视无睹，或认为在整改高潮中不可能同时出现生产高潮，以及对于新高潮抱着等待思想等等现象。负责人说，一般的规律是，群众发动得充分，鸣放得彻底，90％以上职工要提的意见都提了出来；企业领导方面下决心狠狠地改进工作，特别是根据群众的合理意见及时改进了生产管理上的缺点，职工群众的积极性就会随着高涨起来，生产新高潮就形成了。过去企业中究竟是什么东西束缚着职工群众积极性和创造性的进一步发挥呢？主要是企业的领导方面没有很好分析企业的全面情况，不经常系统地研究生产管理上所存在的问题，更不及时依靠工人群众解决这些问题；这种官僚主义作风，阻碍着企业生产的发展。在整风运动开展后，如果这种作风改正得越彻底、越及时，那末新的生产高潮就将来得越早、越顺利。同时，还应该看到，由于各地整风运动进行得早晚不同，各厂矿的具体条件不同，生产高潮的表现形式和形成的早晚程度也将有许多不同的。在通常的情况下，它往往是某一个运动搞得较深较透、群众思想发动得较充分的单位首先出现，然后逐渐推向整个企业和地区。一般都是先由少数先进工人的带动，而后成为多数人的群众运动。运动发展的规律总是从少数到多数，从局部到全体，从不完整到完整的。
    负责人强调指出，要推动这一高潮的到来，应该本着整风生产两不误的精神，切实做好细致的组织工作和下列各方面的群众生产工作：
      （一）密切注意职工群众在生产上的各种创举的萌芽，扶植这些萌芽，使它开花结果。要善于运用典型推动全盘，以点推动面的领导方法。经过这次整风，一个领导人对于各种新事务的能否及时发现和加以重视，将衡量他是否真正克服了官僚主义作风的一个重要标准。
      （二）积极开展群众性的合理化建议活动。负责人说，从目前一些企业的情况看来，群众性的合理化建议非常活跃。工人群众自己提出的建议，往往自己动手加以实施。因此，在新的生产高潮中，我们应该继续依靠工人群众，大胆放手地发动工人群众去解决自己提出来的各种可能解决的问题。现在，有些企业单位把群众鸣放出来的意见归纳成若干问题，组织群众专题讨论，或者用提出课题的办法发动群众解决，效果很好。有些企业单位，广泛运用群众生产会议和技术研究会等形式来组织和发动职工群众解决问题的办法也很好。但是对于重大的生产技术等问题，却需要由企业的领导人亲自掌握，不能轻率处理。负责人又说，今后对于职工群众的物质奖励应当和政治思想教育更好地结合起来。不能由于职工群众政治热情的高涨而忽视了必要的物质奖励工作。
      （三）及时注意总结和推广各种先进经验。所谓组织生产高潮，就是使广大职工群众向先进者看齐，就是要把我们的生产速度提高到新的水平。要使生产建设工作迅速达到先进的水平，只有大力推广先进经验。推广先进经验的范围应该包括普及被采纳的合理化建议和组织职工互相学习一技之长的技术互助活动。各地除了需要注意推广本单位的先进经验以外，还应该结合我国实际情况，积极学习和推广苏联先进经验。
      （四）要继续做好依靠老工人的工作。我国的老工人，由于一般经过较长时期的革命锻炼和生实产践，组织性、纪律性比较强，政治觉悟比较高，生产经验比较丰富。事实证明，他们不但是政治上的骨干力量，而且是生产中的骨干力量；我们应该很好地发挥他们的作用。应该依靠他们去帮助和团结青年工人；应该教育青年工人向老工人学习。还必须积极发挥工程技术人员和职员的作用，并且使他们和工人群众密切合作，搞好生产。
    （五）为了使职工群众的劳动热情保持经常饱满并不断得到提高，必须大力组织社会主义竞赛。通过竞赛，可以把广大职工群众的劳动积极性更好地引导到争取全面超额完成国家计划的目标上去。通过竞赛，把勤俭建国的方针真正变为广大职工群众的行动指南；要在广大职工群众中树立起一种艰苦奋斗，勤劳节俭的道德风尚。同时，在竞赛中还应该密切注意提高产品质量，保证安全生产。
    负责人在谈话中曾反复提出：这次工业生产新高潮，决不是短时期的现象，它的重要意义是不容忽视的。它必将在提前超额完成第一个五年计划的基础上，为出色地完成明年的国家计划，从而为超额完成第二个五年计划创造更加有利的条件；它将为又多、又快、又好、又省地建设我国的社会主义事业提供有力的保证。
