    Turkish Troops Continue to Provoke
    Syrian Army Ordered to Repel Any Invaders

    Combined dispatches: According to Xinhua News Agency, Damascus: A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on the 6th that Syria has ordered its army and anti-aircraft units to fire on any foreign aircraft and troops violating Syrian territory.

    The spokesperson said that this measure was taken after Turkish aircraft and aircraft of unidentified nationality continually violated Syrian airspace, and Turkish troops repeatedly harassed the Syrian border.

    Syrian Acting Foreign Minister Kalas said on the evening of the 5th that after the United Nations concluded the debate on Syria's accusation against Turkey, Turkey's provocative actions against Syria increased.

    Kalas said at a press conference: "The information we have obtained proves that the Turkish troops have not withdrawn from their positions along our border." Turkish troops have only moved from some positions near the Syrian border to other positions on the same border.

    Kalas warned that Syria's accusation is still on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, and if the situation does not improve, Syria will request the UN General Assembly to resume the debate.

    He said that Syria will continue to take all steps to resist "the always possible Turkish aggression."

    Kalas said: Turkey and those who protect it have rejected Syria's proposal to establish an international commission of inquiry to investigate the situation on the Syrian-Turkish border, and they have indirectly admitted Syria's accusations, because the innocent are not afraid of investigation.

    According to Syrian official sources on the 6th, Turkey has carried out new provocations in the past forty-eight hours.

    A statement issued by the Syrian Army Headquarters said that some Turkish soldiers sneaked into two Syrian villages, Abu Ang and Gabda (near Ain al-Zawia, west of Qamishli), on the 4th and exchanged fire with the People's Resistance Army for half an hour. The Turkish soldiers were forced to retreat to their territory.

    The statement said that ten Turkish soldiers sneaked into the village of Kfarnaha in the Harim district, west of Aleppo, on the 5th and stole four horses.

    The statement said that on the evening of the 5th, two Turkish soldiers sneaked into Syrian territory near Qamishli, penetrating nearly 500 meters into the country. They quickly fled after seeing the People's Resistance Army.

    土耳其军队仍在挑衅不休
    叙军受命迎击任何进犯者
    本报综合报道　据新华社大马士革讯：叙利亚外交部发言人6日说，叙利亚已经命令它的陆军部队和高射炮部队向侵犯叙利亚领土的任何外国飞机和军队开火。
    这位发言人说，这一措施是在土耳其飞机和国籍不明的飞机不断侵犯叙利亚领空和土耳其军队多次侵扰叙利亚边境以后采取的。
    叙利亚代理外交部长卡拉斯5日晚间说，在联合国结束了叙利亚对土耳其的控诉案的辩论以后，土耳其对叙利亚的挑衅行动增加了。
    卡拉斯在记者招待会上说：“我们得到的情报证明，土耳其军队并没有撤离我们边境一带的阵地。”土耳其军队只是从在叙利亚边境附近的一些阵地转移到同一边境的另一些阵地上。
    卡拉斯警告说，叙利亚的控诉案还在联合国大会议程上，要是局势没有好转，叙利亚将要求联合国大会恢复辩论。
    他说，叙利亚将继续采取一切步骤，来抵抗“始终是可能发生的土耳其的侵略”。
    卡拉斯说：土耳其和保护它的那些人拒绝了叙利亚提出的关于成立一个国际调查委员会来调查叙利亚—土耳其边境局势的建议，他们就间接地承认了叙利亚的指责，因为无辜的人是不怕调查的。
    据6日叙利亚官方消息说，在过去四十八小时中，土耳其又进行了新的挑衅。
    叙利亚陆军总部发表的声明说，有一些土耳其士兵在4日潜入叙利亚两个村庄阿布·昂和加卜达（在埃因角附近、卡米什利以西），同人民抗敌军互相开火半小时，土耳其士兵被迫退到他们的境内。
    声明说，有十名土耳其士兵5日潜入阿勒颇以西的哈里姆分区的克法尔纳村庄，抢去四匹马。
    声明说，5日晚间，有两名土耳其士兵潜入卡米什利附近的叙利亚国境，深入境内将近五百公尺。他们在看到人民抗敌军以后，很快就逃跑了。
