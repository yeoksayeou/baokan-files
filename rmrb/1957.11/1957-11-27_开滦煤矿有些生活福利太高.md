    Some Living Welfare Benefits at Kailuan Coal Mine are Too High
    It is unreasonable that employees and their families at Kailuan Coal Mine do not have to pay for meals and medical expenses when hospitalized, and do not have to pay for water and electricity in public housing.
    According to the Labor Insurance Regulations, employees' family members should pay half of their medical expenses when they are sick. However, Kailuan Coal Mine currently provides all of this for free. It is estimated that this practice alone costs the country an additional 75,000 yuan per year.
    According to regulations, employees with eight years of service or more should receive their full salary within six months of being hospitalized due to illness. When employees go to work and create wealth for the country, they have to pay for their meals out of their own salaries; however, those who are sick and in the hospital cannot create wealth for the country, but do not have to pay for their own meals. It is even more unreasonable that employees' family members pay for their own meals at home, but the company has to pay for their meals when they are hospitalized.
    It is also unreasonable that employees living in public housing do not pay for water and electricity, and that rent is low. I live in a public housing unit, which is a flat with stone walls and a concrete roof. The monthly rent is 0.52 yuan, and the annual rent is only 6.24 yuan. Many others only pay 0.40 yuan per month for rent. Living in public housing, we use tap water and electric lights for free. If each of the 150,000 people at Kailuan Coal Mine paid 0.10 yuan per month for water, the country would save 180,000 yuan per year; if we calculate electricity based on 100,000 light bulbs, with each bulb costing 0.20 yuan per month, we could save 240,000 yuan per year. This expense spread across the employees would not affect their lives, but the country could accumulate a lot of money.
    Because employees do not pay for water and electricity, the waste of water and electricity is quite serious. For example, residential areas in the city generally use 25 or 30-watt light bulbs, while employees' residential areas use 40-watt, 60-watt, and even 100-watt bulbs, consuming a lot of electricity.
    I believe that the rent for public housing should be adjusted appropriately, and should not be too low; water and electricity fees should also be charged appropriately.

### 开滦煤矿有些生活福利太高

    开滦煤矿有些生活福利太高
    目前开滦煤矿职工和家属有病住院不收膳费和医药费，住公房不花水电费，是不合理的。
    根据劳动保险条例规定，职工的家属有病要花二分之一的医药费。但是目前开滦煤矿却全部免费，这样的做法，估算起来，一年国家就要多开支七万五千元。
    按规定，满八年工龄的职工因病住院，在六个月以内要拿全部工资。职工上班劳动，给国家创造了财富，吃饭要由自己的工资里开支；可是有病住医院的人，不能给国家创造财富，吃饭却自己不掏钱。职工家属在家里吃饭，自己出钱，有病住院吃饭竟要企业出钱，更不合理。
    职工住公房不花水电费，房租低，也是不合理的。我自己住的一间公房，是石头墙、混凝土顶的平房，每月收房租五角二分，一年只需六元二角四分的房租。还有很多人每月只收四角房租。住公房吃自来水、用电灯不花钱。以开滦煤矿十五万人计，每人每月拿出水费一角，国家在一年内就少开支十八万元；电灯按十万个灯头算，每个灯头一月花两角钱，一年就可以少开支二十四万元。这笔开支摊在职工身上，影响不了生活；可是国家就可以积累很多钱。
    因为职工不出水电费，浪费水电现象相当严重。例如，市区住宅一般用二十五或三十度的灯泡，而职工住宅区有用四十度的，有用六十度的，甚至用一百度的，电量消耗很大。
    我认为住公房的房租应适当调整，不应过低；水电费也应适当收。
