Chongqing Auto Parts Factory and Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory Fail to Rectify
Workers Post Big-Character Posters Criticizing

    (Our Newspaper) Chongqing – The slow progress of rectification work at the Chongqing Auto Parts Manufacturing Factory and the Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory Main Factory has drawn criticism from workers.

    At the Chongqing Auto Parts Factory, the leadership's insufficient attention to rectification work meant that after the rectification campaign began on October 15th, it was not until October 30th, under repeated urging from higher authorities and criticism from the masses, that a rectification leading group was established. Even then, a regular meeting and reporting system was not immediately established, causing the rectification to become uncontrolled. From October 15th to October 28th, workers raised over 2,600 suggestions, but only 146 were improved, less than 6% of the total. Many problems that could be resolved easily and without much expense, with just a little attention from the leadership, were also inadequately addressed. Some workers wrote big-character posters questioning the leadership: Why aren't you making vigorous changes after we've offered so many suggestions?

    The factory's leadership has done a very poor job of ideological work with the cadres. Some cadres even openly reject criticism from the masses. For example, on the 29th, a worker posted a big-character poster criticizing the waste in the trade union club's spending on cultural and educational expenses, such as buying musical instruments, making silk clothes, and buying high-heeled leather shoes. The cadre responsible for this work not only did not accept the suggestions and conduct an investigation, but also wrote a lengthy article of several thousand words the next day to refute the worker's suggestions. The masses reacted very negatively. Some workers wrote big-character posters criticizing the leadership, saying: Our leaders here "refuse to change even while rectifying." Some even wrote "Open Letters to the Factory Director," urging them to humbly treat the opinions of the masses and vigorously carry out rectification with a revolutionary spirit.

    Recently, the Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory Main Factory has also seen some big-character posters criticizing the leadership for not being vigorous enough in improving work. In workers' group meetings and forums, some workers have also expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of rectification. Workers cited various examples to show that some problems could be solved immediately, but the leadership did not resolve them. Even when workers asked to solve the problems themselves, the leadership procrastinated and adopted a perfunctory attitude. For example, the No. 1 pump in the Supply and Marketing Section urgently needed repair, and if it broke down, the entire factory would have to stop production. The repair workshop raised the issue several times, but the factory kept delaying and ignoring it. Recently, veteran workers in the repair workshop asked to repair it themselves, but the leadership refused to issue an order. The workers criticized: "The rectification has been going on for so long, and this dragging style of work regarding production has not changed. It's really bad." The phytic acid calcium magnesium group in the raw materials workshop had a machine worth more than 7,000 yuan, which the workshop did not use and did not transfer for other uses. It was left to be corroded by acid gas, and the machine had rusted. Recently, the workers asked to move it away, which was an easy task, but the leadership did not resolve it. The workers said: "These problems are small, but they show that the leadership's determination to improve work is not strong." A worker named Zhou Liren stated in a big-character poster: "If our correct suggestions are not adopted, we will continue to raise them until the problem is resolved." Some workers, seeing that the leadership's determination to improve work was not strong, developed negative emotions, saying: "It's all the same whether we make suggestions or not, the leadership won't change anyway."

    These phenomena have already drawn the attention of the relevant leadership. The responsible comrades of the CCP Shapingba District Committee recently led a working group to inspect the rectification work at the Chongqing Auto Parts Factory and criticized the slow progress of the rectification work. The factory's leadership has begun to pay attention to the rectification work.

### 重庆汽车配件厂、西南制药厂整改不力  工人贴大字报批评

    重庆汽车配件厂、西南制药厂整改不力
    工人贴大字报批评
    本报讯　重庆汽车配件制造厂和西南制药厂总厂整改工作进展迟缓，受到工人的批评。
    重庆汽车配件厂由于领导方面对整改工作重视不够，从10月15日开始整风以后，直到10月30日在上级领导一再督促和群众的批评下才成立了整改领导小组，也没有立即建立一定的会议汇报制度，以致使整改形成自流。这个厂从10月15日开始鸣放到28日止，工人们共提出了二千六百多条意见，而改进了的只有一百四十六条，还不到意见总数的6％。许多不花钱又不费事，只要领导稍加重视就可以解决的问题，也改进得不够。有的工人写大字报质问领导：为什么我们提了那么多意见不狠狠地改？
    这个厂的领导人员对干部的思想工作作的很差。有的干部甚至公开拒绝群众的批评。例如29日有个工人贴大字报对工会俱乐部在买乐器、做绸衣、买高跟皮鞋等文教费开支中的浪费现象提出批评，负责这项工作的干部不但不接受意见进行检查，反而在第二天写了数千字的长文章对这个工人的意见进行反驳。群众反映很不好。有的工人写大字报批评说：我们这里的领导
  “边整偏不改”，有的甚至写了
  “致厂长的公开信”。要求他们虚心对待群众意见，用革命精神大力进行整改。
    西南制药厂总厂最近也出现了一些批评领导改进工作不狠的大字报；在工人们的小组会和座谈会上，也有一些工人对整改不力表示不满。工人举出种种事例，说明有些问题可以马上解决，领导方面却不解决，甚至工人要求自己动手解决，领导方面也一拖再拖，采取敷衍的态度。例如供销科的一号泵浦亟需修理，如果坏了全厂都要停产，机修车间几次提了意见，厂里一直拖延不管；最近修理车间的老工人要求自己去修理，领导上却不给下命令。工人们批评说：“整风这么久了，这种对生产的拖拉作风还没有改，真是不好。”原料车间植酸钙镁小组有一部价值七千多元的机器，车间不用，又不移作他用，一直听任酸气侵蚀，机器已生了锈，最近工人们要求把它搬走，举手之劳，领导方面也不解决。工人们说：“这些问题虽小，但是说明领导方面改进工作的决心不大。”有一个叫周利仁的工人在大字报上表示：“如果不采纳我们的正确意见，我们还要提，直到问题解决为止。”也有工人见领导方面改进工作的决心不大，便产生了消极情绪，说：“提不提都是一样，反正领导上不改”。
    这些现象已经引起有关领导方面的重视。中共沙坪坝区委会负责同志最近领导一个工作组检查了重庆汽车配件厂的整改工作，对整改工作进度迟缓的现象提出了批评。这个厂的领导方面已经开始重视整改工作。
