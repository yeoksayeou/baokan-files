    Rice Bran Oil Extraction Should Not Be Promoted
    The People's Daily published an article written by Comrade Zhou Shangda on September 24 entitled "Promoting Rice Bran Oil Extraction." We have different opinions on this issue.

    We believe that the suggestion to promote rice bran oil extraction only considers increasing oil production and does not take into account the overall economic situation of the country.

    Widespread promotion of rice bran oil extraction will hinder the development of the pig-raising industry.

    After rice bran is used for oil extraction, although the protein and carbohydrates in the bran cake will increase slightly, the fat content will decrease by 64.7%, and the weight will decrease by more than 12%. If all 1.3 million tons of rice bran in the country's cities are used for oil extraction, it will reduce the amount of refined feed by 150,000 to 180,000 tons, which will result in 1.5 to 1.8 million fewer pigs being raised. Fewer pigs raised will naturally reduce manure, hindering grain production, and reducing income for the state and farmers. In total, the losses to the state and farmers will be greater than the value of 180,000 tons of rice bran oil.

    Some say that the grain department can use a certain amount of coarse grains to compensate for the reduction of rice bran due to oil extraction. This is difficult and uneconomical, given the current tight grain supply in our country.

    Regarding whether pig feed needs fat, practice has proven that although pig fat can be converted from carbohydrates and proteins, several fatty acids must be obtained from feed. A lack of these fatty acids will slow or stop pig growth. At the same time, according to experiments by Soviet animal husbandry experts such as Ye. A. Bogdanov, fat in feed can be used as a raw material for forming fat in the animal body. He added vegetable oil to basic feed to feed pigs, proving that every 100 grams of vegetable oil can accumulate 88 grams of fat in the pig's body. It is evident that the fat in rice bran is not wasted when pigs eat it, but will be converted into lard, and its efficiency of conversion is 1.25 times greater than fat from carbohydrates. Comrade Zhou Shangda's statement that "fat growth is not because of eating more 'oil'" is one-sided. We should also see that if rice bran is not used for oil extraction, the 150,000 to 180,000 tons of bran oil in urban rice bran alone can be converted into 130,000 to 160,000 tons of lard through pigs. As everyone knows, lard is better than rice bran oil, and people love to eat it; its economic value is also higher. 180,000 tons of rice bran oil are worth a total of 137 million yuan, while 160,000 tons of lard are worth approximately 280 million yuan, a difference of about double.

    In addition, Comrade Zhou Shangda's article calculates the amount of fat needed by pigs based on the feed analysis composition. This calculation is not practical. As everyone knows, the nutrients contained in feed cannot be fully absorbed, so to calculate whether the fat content in the feed is sufficient for the pig's needs, the amount of digestible fat in the feed should be used. Comrade Zhou Shangda's calculation method cannot be used as a scientific argument.

    We believe that rice bran oil extraction should be reduced in a planned way, maintained at the 1954 level, and should not be expanded further, so as not to affect the development of the pig-raising industry.

    Xiangshan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Violates Oil Crop Procurement Policy
    The Xiangshan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhejiang Province has unauthorizedly allocated 11,000 jin of peanuts purchased from farmers to grassroots cooperatives for sale as roasted peanuts.

    This practice not only undermines the state's policy of unified purchase of oil crops, but also directly affects procurement work. For example, the state assigned our Da Xu District a procurement task of 45,000 jin of peanuts, but not a single jin has been collected so far. This is because the price at which the supply and marketing cooperative purchases fresh peanuts locally is 4 fen per jin, while the selling price of roasted peanuts is 1 jiao 2 fen per jin, which has caused great dissatisfaction among farmers. Some agricultural cooperative members said, "The state buys cheap and sells expensive; the state is just doing business anyway, so we can eat some cheap goods ourselves." Many farmers in Da Xu District have roasted peanuts to eat, and the procurement task of 45,000 jin of peanuts this year has been severely affected. Therefore, we suggest that the supply and marketing department quickly correct this error and not continue to make mistakes.

### 不应该推广米糠榨油

    不应该推广米糠榨油
    人民日报9月24日发表了周上达同志所写“推广米糠榨油”一文。我们对这个问题有不同的看法。
    我们认为，推广米糠榨油的意见，是只从增产油脂的角度出发，而没有从整个国家的经济情况作全面考虑。
    大量推广米糠榨油会妨碍养猪事业的发展。
    米糠榨油以后，糠饼中的蛋白质、炭水化合物相对地虽略有增加，但是脂肪含量要减少64．7％，重量要减少12％以上。如果全国城市一百三十万吨米糠全部榨油，就会减少十五到十八万吨精料，因此就会少养一百五十万到一百八十万头猪。猪养少了自然要减少粪肥，妨碍粮食增产，同时会使国家和农民减少收入。合计起来，国家和农民的损失，比十八万吨糠油的价值还要大。
    有人说，因为榨油而减少一些米糠，粮食部门可以用一定数量的杂粮来弥补。这在目前我国粮食尚不宽裕的情况下是有困难的，而且也不经济。
    关于猪饲料中是否需要有脂肪的问题。实践证明，猪的脂肪固然可以从炭水化合物和蛋白质转化而成，但是有几种脂肪酸必须从饲料中吸取。缺少这些脂肪酸，就会使猪生长缓慢或停止。同时，据苏联畜牧学家叶·阿·波哥达诺夫等人试验，饲料中的脂肪可以作为形成动物体内脂肪的原料。他曾用植物油补加到基础饲料内喂猪，证明每一百克植物油在猪体内可储积八十八克脂肪。可见，猪吃了米糠中的脂肪并不是白费，而是会转化成为猪油，并且比由炭水化合物转化为脂肪的效能要大一点二五倍。周上达同志提出的“脂肪的生长并不是因为多吃了‘油’”的说法是片面的。我们还应该看到，如果米糠不榨油，仅城市米糠中的十五到十八万吨糠油通过猪体就可以转化为十三到十六万吨猪油。大家都知道，猪油比糠油好，人们都爱吃；经济价值也高。十八万吨糠油共值一亿三千七百万元，而十六万吨猪油约值二亿八千万元，相差约一倍。
    另外，周上达同志的文章中计算猪的需要脂肪量是按饲料分析成分计算的。这样计算是不实际的。大家都知道，饲料中所含的养分并不能全部被吸收，因此算饲料中的脂肪量是否够猪体的需要，应该按饲料中的可消化脂肪量来计算。周上达同志的计算方法是不能作为科学论据的。
    我们认为，米糠榨油应该有计划地缩小，维持在1954年的水平，不应该再扩大推广，以免影响养猪事业的发展。

    象山县供销社违反油料收购政策
    浙江省象山县供销合作总社擅自将向农民收购来的花生一万一千斤拨给基层社作烤花生出卖。
    这种作法，不但破坏了国家统购油料作物的政策，而且还直接影响收购工作。例如，国家分配我们大徐区四万五千斤花生的收购任务，直到现在一斤也没有收起来。因为供销社在当地收购鲜花生的价格是四分钱一斤，而烤花生的出售价格是一角二分一斤，农民的意见很大。有的农业社员说：“国家收购便宜卖出贵；国家反正也是做买卖，我们自己也可以吃点便宜货。”大徐区许多农民都把花生烤了吃掉了，今年四万五千斤花生的收购任务受到了严重的影响。所以我们建议供销部门迅速纠正这个错误，不要继续犯下去了。
