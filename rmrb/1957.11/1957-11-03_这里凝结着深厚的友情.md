Here, Deep Friendship is Condensed

"Such a big job, in such a short time, normally no one would dare to take it on. But this is a glorious task, and with the cooperative, we agreed to do it." This is what Jin Shoupeng, the director of the Beijing First Filigree Inlay Cooperative, said when I asked him about undertaking the production of gifts for the Soviet Union.

This precious gift is a Soviet national emblem, six feet six inches high and five feet six inches wide, with cloisonné enamel on pure gold and silver, shining with brilliant colors.

The task was urgent, and the quality requirements were high, but everyone's enthusiasm was very high. Many workers in their fifties and sixties voluntarily gave up their Sunday rest, and some even worked overtime at night. One Saturday afternoon, Director Jin tentatively asked Ma Guangyuan, who was drilling the silver earth in the Soviet national emblem, "Old Ma, do you think we should rest tomorrow?" Old Ma stopped his small axe, his gaze piercing through his reading glasses, and said, "Rest? Don't you see what kind of work this is?" Then he continued to work with a "ding ding" sound.

In Beihai Tuan Cheng, there is a gift waiting to be shipped—a velvet Temple of Heaven. People who see this work of art praise it endlessly. It was completed by velvet flower artist Xia Wenfu in eleven months.

When Xia Wenfu talked about the process of making this work, he said, "Since I was a child, my family was poor, I couldn't afford to study, I had no education, I couldn't write, and I couldn't calculate. I don't know how many times I ran to the Temple of Heaven for this work, counting the one hundred and eighteen railings, dozens of steps, and dense rows of tiles; when I couldn't continue, I had to go to the site to see it."

Eleven months passed. The work was completed. Did it meet the requirements? Because of this, he couldn't sleep or eat for several days. When he finally learned that the leadership had agreed to send this gift to the Soviet Union as one of the national gifts, he said excitedly, "The stone in my heart has finally landed. I would be happy even if the Soviet comrades just glanced at it!"

I have visited several production cooperatives and seen the gifts carefully crafted by the artists, each one more exquisite and moving than the last. There are ivory carvings of "The Sound of Guns on the Cruiser Aurora" made by Yang Shi Hui and Yang Shi Zhong, as well as gifts carefully made by dough figurine artist Lang Shaoan, wood carving veteran Gao Congli, and paper-cutting artist Cong Lin. I also saw many exquisite handicrafts sent from various places to Beijing, ready to be sent to the Soviet Union, such as velvet embroidery, carved lacquerware, Hunan embroidery... and screens inlaid with various gems. These exquisite gifts demonstrate the ingenious skills of our country's artists, and also condense the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

    这里凝结着深厚的友情
      “这样一件大活儿，这么短的时间，平常谁也不敢承担，可是这是一件光荣的任务，又有了合作社，我们就答应下来了。”在我走进北京第一花丝镶嵌合作社，问起他们承做送给苏联的礼品的时候，该社主任靳寿彭这样说。
    这件贵重的礼品，是一个高六尺六、宽五尺六、在纯金银上烧蓝的、闪耀着绚烂的光彩的苏联国徽。
    这次任务紧，质量要求又高，但是大家的情绪都很高。很多五六十岁的工人都自动地停止了礼拜天的休息，有的甚至加夜班干。在一个礼拜六的下午，靳主任试着问正钻凿苏联国徽中银质地球的马光元说：“老马，明天你看咱还休息不？”老马停下了小斧头，目光穿过老花镜说：“休息？不看这是什么活儿。”说完又叮叮地干起来了。
    在北海团城，摆着一件待启运的礼品——绒制天坛。人们看到这件艺术品，都赞不绝口。它是绒花艺人夏文富用十一个月的时间完成的。
    夏文富说起作这件活儿的经过时说：“咱自小家寒，念不起书，没文化，一不能写，二不会算，为这活儿不知到天坛跑了多少次，数那一百一十八根栏杆，几十个台阶和密密麻麻的瓦楞；一作不下去就得去现场看看。”
    十一个月过去了。活作完了。到底合不合乎要求呢？为这，他有好几天睡不着觉，吃不下饭。当他最后知道了领导上同意将这件礼品作为国礼之一送给苏联的时候，他激动地说：“这块心里的石头算落地了，这东西那怕叫苏联同志们看一眼也高兴！”
    我曾走过几个生产合作社，看到艺人们精心制作的礼品，一件比一件精巧动人。这里有杨士惠、杨士忠制造的“阿芙洛尔巡洋舰上的炮声”象牙雕刻，还有面人郎绍安、木雕老艺人高从理、剪纸艺人丛琳等精心制作的礼品。我还看到不少地方送来北京准备送往苏联的多种精美的手工艺品，如绒绣、雕漆，湘绣……和用各种宝石镶嵌的屏风等。这些精致的礼品，表现了我国艺人们的巧妙的技艺，也凝结着中苏人民的深厚的友情。
