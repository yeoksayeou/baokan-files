    Considering Problems Should Not Depart from the Collective; A Section Chief Becoming a Farmer Sets a Precedent
    I agree with Director Yu’s report about having some apprentices become general workers, which is beneficial to socialist construction. We should consider all issues from this perspective. As long as we don't step outside the big circle of socialism, we can do anything.
    Everything should be decided based on need. If needed, a section chief can also participate in agricultural production, a factory director can also become a workshop director, and university students can also operate machine tools. Moreover, these examples can be found everywhere in our country. Why can't apprentices become general workers?

    考虑问题不应离开集体  科长当农民有例在先
    我同意俞厂长的报告，叫一部分徒工去做勤杂工，这对社会主义建设有利。我们考虑一切问题，都应从这一点出发，只要不出社会主义大圈子，做什么都可以。
    一切事情都应根据需要决定。如果需要时，一个科长也可以去参加农业生产，厂长也可以当车间主任，大学生也可以上机床干活，而且这些事例，在我们国家里到处都可找到。为什么徒工不可以当勤杂工呢？
