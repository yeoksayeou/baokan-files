Installing Fluorescent Lights on the Street

A section of Nanjing East Road in Shanghai, from Fujian Middle Road to Tibet Middle Road, will use fluorescent lights as street lights. The installation of these fluorescent street lights will begin on this section of the road in December and is expected to be completed within the year.

According to the plan of the street lamp management office, twenty-two sets of overhead fluorescent lights will be installed in this area. Each set will have two 96-watt fluorescent tubes, equivalent to the luminosity of four ordinary fluorescent lights. The advantages of using fluorescent lights as street lights are: high and soft luminosity and good lighting effect.

    马路上装日光灯
    上海市南京东路从福建中路到西藏中路的一段马路上，将用日光灯做路灯。这种日光灯路灯12月份就可以开始在这段马路上装置，预计年内装置完毕。
    按照路灯管理所的计划，这一地段将装置跨街日光灯二十二组，每组有九十六时日光灯二支，相当于普通日光灯四支的光度。用日光灯作为路灯的优点是：光度大而柔和，照明效果良好。
