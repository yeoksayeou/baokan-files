Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th - Vientiane dispatch: According to the "New Laos" newspaper, the Lao Patriotic Party, with the approval of the former Lao Royal Government's Ministry of Interior on November 18th, announced that it would conduct activities publicly.

The Lao Patriotic Party's predecessor, the Lao Patriotic Front, was established on January 6, 1956, in Sam Neua province, where the Lao Fighting Units were concentrated. Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, served as Chairman of the Central Executive Committee. According to the agreement reached between Prince Souvanna Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong in December 1956, and the joint statement issued by the two princes on November 2nd of this year, after the establishment of the Lao coalition government with representatives of the Lao Fighting Units, the Lao Patriotic Front would become a political party. It would enjoy the same rights and bear the same obligations as other legally established political parties in Laos.

According to the "New Laos" newspaper, the Lao United Party, headed by Phoui Sananikone, and the Lao Committee for Supporting Peace and Neutrality Policy, expressed their congratulations on the establishment of the Lao Patriotic Party.

Paris dispatch: Paris' "Liberation" newspaper on the 27th published a commentary entitled "Despite America's Prohibition, the Two Lao Brothers Embrace," stating that the unification of Laos smoothly eliminated one of the post-war troubles in Indochina. This is a failure of Dulles' policy and also shows that neutralism has made progress.

The commentary condemned the U.S. foreign policy's lack of good faith. The commentary said that facts prove that as long as one disregards the U.S. ban and seriously considers the other party's negotiation proposals, problems can actually be solved.

    老挝爱国党宣布公开活动
    新华社河内28日电　万象消息：据“新老挝报”报道，老挝爱国党在11月18日经前老挝王国政府内务部批准宣布公开进行活动。
    老挝爱国党的前身老挝爱国战线于1956年1月6日在寮国战斗部队集结的桑怒省成立。由寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王担任中央执行委员会主席。根据1956年12月富马亲王和苏发努冯亲王达成的协议和两位亲王在今年11月2日发表的联合声明规定，在有寮国战斗部队代表参加的老挝联合政府成立后，老挝爱国战线将成为一个政党，它同在老挝依法建立的其他政党一样，享有同等的权利，并负有同等的义务。
    据“新老挝报”报道，以彭·苏发那冯为首的老挝联合党和老挝拥护和平中立政策委员会对老挝爱国党的成立表示了祝贺。
    巴黎讯：巴黎“解放报”27日在以“不顾美国的禁止，老挝两兄弟相抱了”为题的评论中说，老挝的统一顺利地消除了印度支那的战争后患之一。这是杜勒斯政策的失败，也表明中立主义有了进展。
    评论谴责美国外交政策不守信义。评论说，事实证明，只要是不顾美国的禁令，认真看待对方的谈判建议，就可以实际解决问题。
