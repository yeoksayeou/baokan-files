　　The resolute, bold, and thorough improvement of work has become a surge in the 28 units affiliated with the Ministry of Commerce. Most units have been able to: study the opinions put forward by the masses during the great blooming and contending, item by item, and give an account for each item and a resolution for each matter. Before launching a great debate, problems within the scope of the department that could be changed were basically improved. As of November 12, more than one-third of the 11,867 opinions raised by the masses in various units under the Ministry of Commerce had been processed and resolved. The pharmaceutical, knitwear, and transportation electrical equipment companies, as well as the Education Bureau, Finance Bureau, and Accounting Bureau, have basically completed all the changes that could be made immediately.

　　In the rectification work, leading comrades of all units were able to personally study the opinions voiced by the masses item by item. Generally, the opinions raised by the masses on the same day were studied and improved by the core group the next day, and a batch was processed and announced to the masses. The core leading group of the Transportation Electrical Equipment Company also regularly checked the rectification situation of its subordinate departments and offices, and promptly criticized units with poor rectification efforts on the blackboard newspaper.

　　Because the leaders of each unit were very determined to improve their work and dealt with problems quickly, many long-standing problems were resolved more thoroughly. The sample management work of the Knitwear and Cotton Textile Company, although some systems had been established in the past, they were not implemented. As a result, many samples sent by production units were either only looked at by the person in charge, or even locked up without being looked at at all, and the role of the samples was not brought into play at all. Now, improvement measures have been formulated. Some outdated samples have been handed over to the Beijing Company for sale at a discount; the samples remaining in the company have been specially set up in a sample showroom, which is managed and processed by a dedicated person. The business department is studying methods for the sample research issue. In addition, problems such as unreasonable grade increases and unreasonable subsidies for some cadres have also been dealt with. After research by the rectification leading group, it has now been approved that the positions or grades of 23 people are too high, and they have been reduced accordingly. Among them, nine section chiefs were reduced to staff members, and seven section chiefs were reduced to clerks. The 39 people who wrongly received subsidies have returned 247 yuan of subsidies to the public. Some cadres who received too much subsidy have also voluntarily returned the excess subsidy to the public.

　　The issue of leadership and cadre style is also one of the focuses of leaders' work improvement. The main responsible cadres of each unit have taken the initiative to examine their shortcomings and mistakes at mass meetings or group meetings, and expressed their determination to overcome shortcomings and mistakes. Managers of units such as the Knitwear and Cotton Textile Company and the Pharmaceutical Company have established a system of regularly receiving the masses. There are also individual cadres who have long been burdened by individualistic thoughts and seriously divorced from the masses, who have also been supervised and educated by the masses in this rectification. For example, Comrade Wang Lin, the former deputy section chief of the planning section of the Transportation Electrical Equipment Company, was punished with dismissal for making mistakes in the past and had long held resentment, using neurasthenia as an excuse not to go to work. During this rectification, under the supervision of the masses and the help of the leaders, Comrade Wang Lin began to realize his past mistakes and posted a big-character poster for the first time to make a review. Now he goes to work all day every day and participates in the rectification movement.

　　In terms of the method of change, for relatively important or far-reaching issues, the core groups of most units have handed over the improved measures to the masses for discussion after studying them. For example, on the issue of improving information work in the Education Bureau, initially, only some people proposed to improve the work of the information room, but they did not know much about the nature, task, scale, supply scope, and principles and methods of collecting and managing information. Therefore, opinions were divided. Later, after the core group put forward preliminary opinions, it was handed over to everyone for in-depth discussion and supplementation, and finally, a more practical and feasible plan was formulated.

　　However, the degree of change in each unit is still very uneven. Some units have received a lot of opinions from the masses, but the changes are very slow. For example, as of the 17th, the Wage Bureau had received 120 opinions from the masses, but only five had been changed; the Coal Construction Company had received 469 opinions from the masses, but only 61 had been changed. Some units only expressed their attitude emptily, without practical measures, and the masses reflected that there was a tendency towards formalism. These issues have aroused the attention of the leadership of the Ministry of Commerce.

    条条意见有交代　能改的立即就改
    商业部发动群众大力整改
    本报讯　坚决、大胆、彻底地改进工作，已在商业部所属二十八个单位形成热潮。大部分单位已能做到：将群众在大鸣大放中所提的意见，逐条进行研究，并且条条有交代，件件有着落，在展开大争大辩之前，凡是本部门范围内有条件改的问题，都基本上作了改进。到11月12日为止，商业部所属各单位群众提出的一万一千八百六十七条意见，已有三分之一以上得到处理和解决。医药、针织品、交通电工器材公司和教育局、财务局、会计局等单位，已把能立即改的问题都已基本改完。
    在整改工作中，各单位领导同志都能亲自动手，逐条研究群众鸣放的意见，一般是当天群众提出的意见，核心组次日即进行研究改进，并且处理一批就向群众宣布一批。交电公司核心领导小组并定期检查所属各处的整改情况，对整改不力的业务处、办公室等单位，及时在黑板报上点名批评。
    由于各单位领导改进工作的决心很大，处理问题迅速，使许多长期未能解决的问题得到了比较彻底的解决。针棉织品公司的样品管理工作，过去虽订过一些制度，但没有执行，因此许多生产单位寄来的样品，有些只由经手人看一看，有些甚至连看都不看就锁起来，根本没有发挥样品的作用。现在已订出了改进办法，一部分过时的样品交给北京市公司折价出售；另一部分留在公司的样品，专门开辟了一间样品陈列室，由专人负责保管和处理，对于样品研究的问题，正由业务处研究办法。此外，对有些干部提级不合理和补助不合理的问题也作了处理。经整风领导小组研究，现在已批准二十三人职位或级别过高的，分别降低，其中九个处长降为科长、七个科长降为科员。错领补助费的三十九人已把二百四十七元补助费退还公家，有些多领补助费的干部也自动把多领的补助费交还公家。
    对于领导和干部作风问题，也是领导改进工作的重点之一，各单位主要负责干部，都在群众大会或小组会上主动检查了自己的缺点和错误，并表示克服缺点和错误的决心，针棉织品公司、医药公司等单位的经理，都订了定期接待群众的制度，还有个别长期背着个人主义思想包袱，严重脱离群众的干部，也在这次整改中受到了群众的监督和教育。如交电公司前计划科副科长王霖同志，过去曾因犯错误，受了撤职处分，长期存在着抵触情绪，借口神经衰弱不愿上班。这次整改中，在群众监督和领导帮助下，王霖同志开始悔悟到自己过去的错误，第一次贴出大字报作了检讨，现在每天都整日上班，并参加了整风运动。
    在改的方法上，凡是比较重要或者牵涉较广的问题，大部分单位的核心小组在研究了改进措施后，都交给群众去讨论。如教育局对改进资料工作的问题上，开始仅有人提出要改进资料室工作，但对资料室的性质、任务、规模、供应范围以及搜集保管资料的原则和方法，都不很了解，因此，意见纷云。后经核心小组提出了初步的意见，再交由大家深入讨论和补充，最后制定出一个比较切实可行的方案。
    但是，各单位改的程度还很不平衡。有些单位群众意见提了不少，但改的却很迟缓。如截至17日工资局群众提了一百二十条意见，只改了五条；煤建公司群众提出四百六十九条意见，只改了六十一条。还有些单位只空空洞洞地表示了态度，没有切实的措施，群众反映有形式主义的偏向。这些问题已引起商业部领导上的重视。
