Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Since liberation, the economy of mountainous areas in our country has recovered and developed. The backward and impoverished state of most mountainous areas has changed to varying degrees, and some are gradually changing.

According to investigations by relevant departments, more than 80% of mountain farmers in Shanxi Province are able to eat and dress warmly and have pocket money. According to a typical survey of 17 households in Xiaochuan Township, Yun County, Hubei Province, the average annual income per person is now more than 10% higher than before liberation. About 20% of the total number of farmers earn around 50 yuan per year, about 50% earn around 30 yuan per year, and about 30% earn around 20 yuan per year. In 1956, the purchasing power of people in the mountainous areas of Fuling Special District, Sichuan Province, increased by more than 20% compared with 1955. Daobakou Village in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, has 35 households and 157 people, and it used to be a poor mountain village. In the past few years, due to the implementation of the policy of organizing, comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and other diverse economies in mountainous areas, the entire village has undergone fundamental changes. In 1956, agricultural output increased by 60% compared with before the Anti-Japanese War. Each household has an average of more than two large livestock, twenty sheep, nearly two pigs, more than ten chickens, and more than one box of bees. The village has 17,500 mu of mature forests and thatch forests. In 1956, although it suffered severe waterlogging and floods, resulting in a 50% reduction in agricultural production, the total income of the village still reached about 14,600 yuan. After deducting the public accumulation of the agricultural cooperative and the payment of agricultural tax, the average income per person was more than 70 yuan. Tongyi Township in Xin Jin County, Liaoning Province, was called "Poor Wan Gou" before liberation. Since liberation, however, farmers have built farmland water conservancy projects, repaired terraces and drainage ditches. In 1956, the unit area yield of grain reached 430 jin, an increase of 115% compared with 1950. In the past few years, the township has followed the principle of "planting oak trees and shrubs in high mountains and distant mountains, and planting fruit trees in near mountains, low mountains, slopes, and river banks." A total of more than 4,000 hectares of forest have been planted, and more than 66,000 fruit trees have been planted, of which 14,700 have begun to bear fruit, with an annual output of 8.5 million jin. Animal husbandry and silkworm breeding have also been developed due to reasonable planning. The number of large livestock has increased from 928 in 1953 to 1,160, goats have increased from 400 to 861, and tussah silkworms have increased from 100 to 300. The income from fruit trees, tussah silkworms, and animal husbandry alone reached 300,000 yuan in 1956, an increase of more than two and a half times compared with 80,000 yuan in 1950. The former "Poor Wan Gou" has become today's "Rich Wan Gou." Since 1953, Shuimen Village in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, has suffered varying degrees of disasters. However, due to the development of diversified operations such as agriculture, animal husbandry, fruit trees, silkworm breeding, beekeeping, lime burning, medicinal herb digging, and stone slab production, annual income has increased. The masses said: "In the family, do more work (diversified operations), if you don't get it here, you'll get it there."

In the past few years, state-owned commercial departments have done a lot of work in supporting the restoration and development of the mountain economy. In addition to helping farmers sell products and supplying means of production and livelihood, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also conducted a general survey of local products in mountainous areas and helped agricultural cooperatives formulate sideline production plans. Commercial departments in many areas have expanded commercial networks in mountainous areas, vigorously purchased materials from mountainous areas, and helped farmers with processing. Ganhechang District in Miyun County, Hebei Province, is rich in apricots, peaches, pears, etc. Due to inconvenient transportation, they cannot be transported out. This year, the Miyun County Supply and Marketing Cooperative jointly established a small drying plant with the local agricultural cooperative in Shitang Village to process these fruits and then transport them for sale to other places. According to statistics from 45 counties in Heilongjiang Province, by the end of May this year, 882 supply and marketing cooperatives in the province had helped more than 5,000 agricultural cooperatives plan for half a year or a full year of sideline production. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also signed combination contracts or purchase contracts with agricultural cooperatives. In Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, supply and marketing cooperatives in just nine counties have signed more than 1,000 contracts with agricultural cooperatives, with a total value of 3.59 million yuan.

At present, the development of the mountainous economy in various places is uneven. Areas near mountains, large rivers, and convenient transportation are better, while areas in deep mountains, with inconvenient transportation, and that have suffered serious war damage and natural disasters are still relatively poor.

### 山区经济正在恢复发展  大部分山区的穷困面貌已有不同程度的改变

    山区经济正在恢复发展
    大部分山区的穷困面貌已有不同程度的改变
    新华社9日讯　解放以来，我国山区经济得到恢复和发展，大部分山区原来落后和穷困的面貌已经有不同程度的改变，有的正在逐渐改变。
    据有关部门调查，山西省山区农户有80％以上能够吃饱穿暖，并有零用钱花。据湖北省郧县小川乡十七户的典型调查，现在每人每年的平均收入比解放以前上升10％以上，每人每年收入在五十元上下的占农户总数的20％左右，收入在三十元上下的占农户总数的50％左右，收入在二十元上下的占30％左右。四川省涪陵专区山区人民购买力1956年比1955年提高了20％以上。山西省昔阳县刀把口村有居民三十五户，一百五十七人，过去是一个穷困的山庄。几年来，由于贯彻了组织起来、全面发展山区的农业、林业、畜牧业副业等多种经济的方针，全村面貌已经发生了根本的变化。1956年农业产量比抗战前提高了60％，每户平均有大牲口两头多，羊二十只，猪近两头，鸡十多只，蜜蜂一箱多，全村有成材林和茅林一万七千五百亩。1956年虽然遭受了严重的涝灾和洪灾，农业减产50％，但是全村总收入仍达一万四千六百元左右，除扣除农业社的公共积累和交纳农业税以外，平均每人收入七十多元。辽宁省新金县同益乡，解放前被称为“穷弯沟”，但自解放以来，农民们兴修了农田水利，修整了梯田和排水沟，1956年粮食单位面积产量达到四百三十斤，比1950年提高了115％。几年来全乡本着“高山、远山造柞树和灌木林，近山、矮山、坡地、河边栽果树”的原则，共造林四千多垧，栽果树六万六千多株，其中已有一万四千七百株开始结果，年产量达八百五十万斤。牧业和养蚕业由于作了合理规划，也都得到了发展。现在大牲口已由1953年的九百二十八头增加到一千一百六十头、山羊由四百只增加到八百六十一只，柞蚕由一百把增加到三百把。单是果树、柞蚕和畜牧业的收入，1956年已达到三十万元，比1950年的八万元增加了二倍半还多。从前的“穷弯沟”已经变为今天的“富弯沟”了。河北省邢台县水门村自1953年以来，都遭受了不同程度的灾害，但是由于开展了农业、畜牧、果树、养蚕、养蜂、烧石灰、刨药材、打石板等多种经营，每年的收入都有提高。群众说：“在家人，多下手（多种经营），这里不收，那里收。”
    几年来，国营商业部门在扶植山区经济的恢复和发展上做了不少工作。各地供销合作社除了帮助农民推销产品、供应生产资料和生活资料以外，还在山区普遍调查了土产的情况，帮助农业社制订副业生产规划。许多地区的商业部门在山区扩大商业网，大力收购山区的物资，并帮助农民加工。河北省密云县赶河厂区盛产杏、桃、梨等，由于交通不便运不出来，今年密云县供销社在石塘村同当地农业社合办了小型的烤干厂，加工这些水果，然后运销外地。据黑龙江省四十五个县统计，到今年5月底止，全省已有八百八十二个供销社帮助五千多个农业社规划了半年或全年的副业生产。各地供销社还同农业社签订结合合同或采购合同。云南省大理白族自治州仅九个县的供销社就同农业社签订合同一千多份，总值三百五十九万元。
    目前各地山区经济的发展是不平衡的，近山、大川、交通方便的地区较好，深山、交通不便、遭受严重战争破坏和自然灾害的地区还比较差。
