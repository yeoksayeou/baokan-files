Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th: Today, the 1957 Seventeen City Fencing and Gymnastics Championships entered the tense stage of competing for the championship.

After the preliminary round of the women's foil event, nine winners out of twenty-six "female swordsmen" participated in today's finals. Wang Enzhu from Beijing won the championship, and Huo Shiru from Tianjin won the second place.

The result of this competition was difficult to predict beforehand. Last year's first place winner, Ni Zhenzhu from Tianjin, was unexpectedly defeated by Wang Chenyu, a seventeen-year-old middle school student from Shanghai, in the first match of the preliminary round, and then lost to Zhou Fuhua, a student from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education, and was eliminated. Last year's second place winner, Zhao Keying, a female teacher from Beijing, also failed to qualify for the finals.

The preliminary rounds of the men's foil and florets were also completed today. Judging from the current situation, athletes from Beijing and Shanghai have a greater chance of winning the final victory.

Some experts believe that most athletes have improved their swordsmanship this year. Last year, fencing athletes hardly knew or even understood how to use strategy and tactics, but this year athletes generally used clever and flexible offensive and defensive tactics.

Fencing is a fighting technique of European knights in the Middle Ages, and it has long been listed as a beneficial sport. Although this sport has only been developed for just over a year in our country, the number of athletes participating in the women's foil competition has increased from six last year to twenty-six this year; the number of male athletes has also increased from eighteen to forty-six.

In addition, the 1957 National Seventeen City Fencing and Gymnastics Championships opened in Tianjin on the 6th.

More than 160 male and female athletes from sixteen cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Changchun, Harbin, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang, Nanjing, Jinan, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Chengdu (Chongqing athletes did not arrive) participated in the opening ceremony. The championships include all gymnastics events: men's and women's free exercise, single gymnastics, men's doubles strength movements, mixed doubles movements, and three-person group movements. The fencing events include men's and women's foil and men's florets.

    全国击剑、技巧赛在津举行
    新华社天津8日电　今天，1957年十七城市击剑、技巧运动锦标赛进入了争夺冠军的紧张阶段。
    女子轻剑经过预赛，二十六名“女剑客”中有九名优胜者参加了今天的决赛。北京的王恩珠获得冠军，天津的霍士儒获得亚军。
    这次比赛的结果事先难以预料。去年的第一名、天津选手倪珍珠，在预赛中第一次上场就出其不意地被上海十七岁的中学生王琛玉击败，接着又败给了北京体育学院学生周福华而被淘汰。去年的第二名、北京的女教师赵克英也没有取得决赛权。
    男子轻剑和花式剑预赛，也在今天结束。从目前来看，北京和上海的运动员获得最后胜利的希望比较大。
    一些专家认为，今年大部分运动员的剑术都有了提高。去年击剑运动员几乎不会甚至不懂得运用战略战术，而今年运动员们却普遍地运用了机智灵巧的进攻和防守战术。
    击剑是中世纪时代欧洲骑士们一种格斗技术，它很早就被列为一项有益的运动项目。这项运动在我国虽然只开展了一年多，但参加女子轻剑比赛的运动员已由去年的六名增加到二十六名；男运动员也从十八名增加到四十六名。
    又讯　1957年全国十七城市击剑、技巧运动锦标赛6日在天津开幕。
    参加开幕式的有北京、天津、上海、沈阳、旅大、长春、哈尔滨、西安、郑州、石家庄、南京、济南、杭州、武汉、广州和成都等十六城市（重庆运动员未到）的一百六十多名男女运动员。锦标赛包括所有的技巧项目：男、女自由体操、单人技巧、男子双人用力动作、男女混合双人动作和三人团体动作。击剑项目包括男子、女子轻剑和男子花式剑。
