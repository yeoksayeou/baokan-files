(Our Shanghai, November 29th dispatch) Reporter Xi Ping reports: A high tide of great airing of views, great rectification, and great improvement has emerged in the rectification movement of Party and government organs in Shanghai. A massive force of over 430 organs and over 80,000 cadres is enthusiastically airing views, primarily through the medium of big-character posters. The powerful strength of the masses and the determination of the leading cadres are converging. The rectification and improvement in many organs are vigorous and dynamic. To date, over 270,000 opinions have been raised in various forms, including big-character posters.

In the key stage of rectification and improvement, the Party and government organs in Shanghai are focusing on the leading cadres, implementing "drawing fire to oneself," and criticizing the three isms from several aspects. On the one hand, the masses are mobilized to offer opinions to the leaders. At the same time, superiors and subordinates, as well as leaders at the same level, "lift the lid" on each other, conducting criticism and self-criticism, thoroughly exposing the errors and shortcomings in leadership work. The progress of the movement proves that in order to do a good job of rectification and improvement, in addition to the supervision of the broad masses, it is also necessary for superiors and subordinates and leading cadres to "lift the lid" on each other based on the opinions of the masses, so that the criticism of the leaders and the masses can be combined and promote each other. After many units in Shanghai adopted this method of multi-faceted criticism, many problems of leaders and leadership work at the municipal and district levels have begun to be exposed, such as the sectarianism of some leading cadres in implementing the cadre policy of "only using familiar people"; the long-term unprincipled peaceful coexistence between some leading cadres, accommodating each other, without criticism and self-criticism; the serious tendency of individual special privileges of some leading cadres, and unprincipled disputes and disunity among leading cadres. Many of these problems are quite serious in nature, and some are long-standing old problems, and now the "lid" has been lifted. Some cadres of the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee organs and some cadres at the municipal, district, and grassroots levels have also criticized the leadership of the Municipal Committee and the secretaries of the Municipal Committee Secretariat.

Now, in over 400 organs, big-character posters are increasing day by day, and the problems raised are often analyzed, criticized, and suggested, and are gradually focused on important issues. The firepower of the big-character posters in various organs is particularly concentrated on the following three aspects:

	Criticizing Bureaucracy
		"Employees meet but do not know each other,
		Smiling, they ask, 'Where do you come from?'"

The bureaucracy of leaders being divorced from reality and the masses, and the subjectivism of not proceeding from reality, are the focus of the masses' criticism of the leaders in many organs. A big-character poster in the Maritime Transport Bureau criticized a bureau director for not going deep into the work, saying: "Leading technology for many years, how many times have you gone deep into the grassroots? Employees meet but do not know each other, smiling, they ask, 'Where do you come from?'" On a big-character poster in the CCP Huangpu District Committee organs entitled "Looking at the Whirlwind of Hatred," the author passionately and sharply questioned the bureaucratic style of the district committee leadership for not going deep into the masses, "Why can't you go deep into the masses to work like Dzerzhinsky?" The author enthusiastically suggested that the leading comrades go and watch this movie carefully. At the Shanghai No. 1 Machine Tool Manufacturing Company, many big-character posters revealed that the company's leaders had not implemented the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift in the basic construction investment of the Huafu Gear Factory. The factory's building construction investment was only 10,000 yuan, while the company's investment in the construction of the dining hall and dormitory reached 40,000 yuan. The built dining hall could accommodate 200 people, and the dormitory could accommodate 104 people, while the factory's production and non-production personnel, including apprentices, totaled only 94 people.

	Criticizing Unhealthy Tendencies
		"Leading cadres are not united,
		It's hard to sing a song of harmony between generals and ministers."

The decline of leading cadres' political ideology, the lack of unity among them, individual special privileges, and other unhealthy tendencies were also extensively exposed by the masses on big-character posters. On a big-character poster in the CCP Huangpu District Committee, the author loudly and urgently advised a district committee secretary: "You are lagging behind!" He listed the facts that this district committee secretary was not actively working in previous movements and demanded that the district committee standing committee help him. Another big-character poster in an organ criticized a "chess fan" Party member leader, "Your spare time is all spent in the club, and you are rarely seen studying, which is a sign of political decline." There was also a couplet criticizing the disunity of two Party member leaders. The upper line is: "Both are liberals, whispering behind their backs, full of complaints." The lower line is: "Two communists, shy and hesitant, it's hard to sing a song of harmony between generals and ministers." A big-character poster in the Shanghai District Maritime Transport Administration criticized the lack of criticism among the bureau director leaders, saying: "The principle of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in each other's affairs is not applicable among your bureau directors!" In the big-character posters of the Shanghai Real Estate Administration Bureau and the Maritime Transport Bureau, people exposed that some leading cadres occupied too many houses and furniture when housing was scarce, and some leading cadres in some organs did not receive trade union and state hardship subsidies in accordance with regulations, or used their positions to introduce their relatives to work.

	Criticizing Overstaffing
		"Offices have nothing to do,
		Libraries are full."

How to make state organs a more efficient institution and change the current phenomenon of large institutions and overstaffing in most organs is also one of the focuses of discussion in many organ big-character posters. The office staff of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee concentrated on the phenomenon of bloated institutions and overstaffing in the office during the airing of views and raised sharp criticisms. Big-character posters revealed that the current office of the Municipal People's Committee has five departments, two sections, and five groups, and many of the businesses in charge are duplicated. Because of the duplication of institutions, even if a document is distributed on the same floor, it still has to go through several receiving and sending procedures. The big-character posters also revealed that because there are too many correspondents belonging to the Municipal People's Committee, each correspondent only needs to work three hours a day, and sometimes some people don't even come to work for three or four days. People spend their time in the library, forming an abnormal phenomenon of full occupancy in the library during office hours. People made sincere requests to the leaders in many big-character posters: quickly end this situation and send the surplus people to the countryside and grassroots.

### 强大的群众力量加上领导干部的决心  上海机关全面围攻三个主义

    强大的群众力量加上领导干部的决心
    上海机关全面围攻三个主义
    本报上海29日电　记者习平报道：一个大鸣大放大整大改的热潮，已在上海党群和政府机关的整风运动中出现，包括四百三十多个机关、八万多机关干部的一支庞大队伍，正在以大字报为主要形式热烈地鸣放，强大的群众力量和领导干部的决心相汇合，许多机关的整改轰轰烈烈，到目前为止，已用大字报等各种形式提出了二十七万多条意见。
    上海党群和政府机关在着重整改阶段中，大鸣大放大整大改主要从领导干部入手，实行了“引火烧身”，从几个方面对三个主义进行批评，一方面是发动群众对领导提意见，同时上下级之间，同级领导人之间，相互地“揭盖子”，开展批评和自我批评，彻底揭露领导工作中的错误和缺点。运动的进程证明：要搞好整改，除广大群众的监督外，还须要上下级之间和领导干部相互之间根据群众的意见相互地“揭盖子”，使领导与群众的批评相互结合，相互推动。上海不少单位采取了这个几面批评的办法之后，市区两级许多领导干部和领导工作中的问题，已开始被揭发了出来，如某些领导干部在执行干部政策上“用人唯熟”的宗派主义；某些领导干部之间长期无原则的和平共处，互相迁就，没有批评和自我批评；某些领导干部严重的个人特殊化倾向，领导干部之间闹无原则纠纷，不团结等等。其中有不少问题，性质都相当严重，有些是积压已久的老问题，现在都把“盖子”揭开了。中共上海市委机关有的干部和市、区及基层有些干部，也对市委领导上和市委书记处书记们提出了批评。
    现在四百多个机关里，大字报正一天多一天，提出的问题很多是有分析，有批评，有建议，并且逐渐集中到重要问题上。各机关的大字报的火力，特别集中在下面三个方面。
    批评官僚主义
      职工相见不相识
      笑问君从何处来
    领导上脱离实际，脱离群众的官僚主义与不从实际出发的主观主义，这是许多机关里群众对领导批评的重点，海运局大字报批评了一个局长工作不深入说：“领导技术经数载，深入基层有几回，职工相见不相识，笑问君从何处来？”在中共黄浦区委机关一张题为“看了仇恨的旋风”的大字报上，作者热情而尖锐地责问区委领导上不深入群众的官僚主义，“为什么不能像捷尔任斯基那样深入群众去工作？”作者热情地建议领导同志去好好看看这部电影。在上海第一机床制造公司，许多大字报揭发了这个公司领导在华富齿轮厂的基本建设投资中没有贯彻勤俭建国的方针，这个工厂的厂房建设投资只有一万元，而公司对饭厅宿舍建筑的投资竟达四万元，建筑的一所饭厅可容纳二百人，宿舍可住一百零四人，而这个厂的生产人员和非生产人员连同艺徒在内，却只有九十四人。
  批评不良倾向
      领导干部不团结
      难唱一曲将相和
    领导干部政治思想上的衰退，相互之间的不团结，个人的特殊化等等不良倾向，也被群众在大字报上大量揭发了出来，中共黄浦区委一张大字报上，作者大声疾呼地忠告一个区委书记：“你落后了！”他历述了这个区委书记在历次运动中不积极工作的事实，要求区委常委对他进行帮助。另一个机关里一张大字报批评一位“棋迷”党员领导干部，“你的业余时间全部消磨在俱乐部里，很少看到你学习，这是政治上衰退的表现。”还有一副对联批评了两个党员领导人不团结。上联是：“同是自由主义，嘀嘀咕咕背后满腹牢骚话”下联是：“两个共产党员，忸忸怩怩难唱一曲将相和”，上海区海运管理局一张大字报批评局长领导干部相互缺乏批评的现象说：“和平共处互不侵犯原则，在你们局长之间是不适用的呀！”上海房地产管理局、海运局的大字报上，人们揭发了一些领导干部在房屋紧张的情况下占用过多的房屋和家具，还有些机关一些领导干部不按照制度规定领取工会、国家困难补贴，或是利用了职权把自己的亲戚介绍参加了工作。
  批评人浮于事
      办公室无事可做
      图书馆座不虚席
    如何使国家机关成为一个更有效率的机构，改变目前大部分机关中机构庞大，人浮于事的现象，也是许多机关大字报讨论的中心之一。上海市人民委员会办公厅的机关工作人员在鸣放中，集中地对办公厅机构臃肿，人浮于事的现象提出了尖锐的批评，大字报上揭发，目前市人委办公厅有五个处、两个科、五个组，而分管的业务很多是重复的，因为机构重复，分发一件文件，虽然同在一层楼上，还要经过几道收发手续。大字报还揭发，由于市人民委员会所属的通讯员过多，每天每个通讯员只需要做三小时的工作，有时甚至有人三、四天也不到班，人们把时间消磨在图书室里，形成了在办公时间内图书室内座无虚席的反常现象。人们在许多大字报上向领导提出恳切的请求：迅速结束这种状况把多余的人下放到农村、基层中去。
