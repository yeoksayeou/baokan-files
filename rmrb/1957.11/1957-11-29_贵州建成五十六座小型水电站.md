Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 28th: Since last spring, Guizhou Province, which is mountainous and has rapid streams, has successively completed fifty-six similar small rural hydropower stations. The generating capacity of the larger ones is 461 kilowatts, while the smaller ones are only 3 kilowatts, with a total of 1,173 kilowatts.

These hydropower stations have not only provided electricity to the people of various ethnic groups in some remote mountains, but have also played a significant role in increasing agricultural production. After the Yaojiashao Hydropower Station in Huishui County, Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, was completed and generated electricity in May this year, in addition to meeting the lighting needs of the county seat and agricultural cooperatives near the station, it also established five electric pumping stations, enabling more than 5,000 mu of dry land that had never had a guaranteed water source to increase rice production by more than 250,000 jin compared to last year. Many hydropower stations have also used electricity to develop sideline production such as rice milling, flour milling, and oil pressing.

Guizhou Province has numerous rivers and abundant hydropower resources. Next year, the province will continue to build a number of small hydropower stations with a total generating capacity of 780 kilowatts. The construction of these power stations generally adopts the method of public-private partnership.

    贵州建成五十六座小型水电站
    据新华社贵阳28日电　自去年春天以来，山多流急的贵州省已经陆续建成类似的小型农村水电站五十六座，发电能力高的有四百六十一瓩，少的只有三瓩，总共一千一百七十三瓩。
    这些水电站不仅使一些深山中的各族人民有了电灯，还对农业增产起了很大作用。黔南布依族苗族自治州惠水县姚家哨水电站今年5月份完工发电以后，除了满足县城及电站附近农业社照明以外，还建立起电力抽水机站五处，使五千多亩历来没有水源保证的旱田，比去年增产稻谷二十五万多斤。许多水电站还利用电力发展了碾米、磨粉、榨油等副业生产。
    贵州省河流纵横，水力资源很丰富，明年全省将继续兴建一批总发电能力达七百八十瓩的小型水电站。这些电站的兴建，一般都采用民办公助的办法。
