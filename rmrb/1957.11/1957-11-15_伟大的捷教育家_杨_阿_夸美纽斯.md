The Great Czech Educator – Jan Amos Comenius
Professor of Education, Beijing Normal University, Chen Jingpan

Jan Amos Comenius (1592-1670) was a great Czech patriotic and democratic educator. His educational theory is one of the most valuable contributions of the Slavic people to world culture. He was a defender of Czech national independence and a brave warrior for peace. This year marks the 300th anniversary of the publication of Comenius' complete works on education and the 365th anniversary of his birth. The World Peace Council has listed Comenius as one of the world cultural figures to be commemorated this year.

He ingeniously summarized the advanced educational theories and practices of his time, and based on his many years of excellent educational experience, created an outstanding educational system. At that time, the democratic movement of sects, Bacon's scientific method, and the realism of the Renaissance were all reflected in his educational thought. He laid the foundation for modern educational science and is known as the "founder of educational science."

The era in which he lived was a period of great change in European society: the feudal system was rapidly transforming into the capitalist system, class contradictions were very acute, and many oppressed nations were constantly struggling for independence and freedom. In Western Europe, bourgeois revolutions took place in the Netherlands and England, and in Ukraine and Belarus, there were long-term struggles to liberate themselves from the oppression of Polish nobles; the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) was a vivid example of the class and national contradictions of this era. These contradictions of the times had a great influence on his life and thoughts.

Comenius was born in Uherský Brod, Moravia. His father was a miller who engaged in milling and was an enthusiastic member of the Bohemian Brotherhood, a patriotic and progressive group at the time. This group was a descendant of the glorious Taborites of the 15th century, inheriting the "Hussite tradition" of fighting for religious, national, and social freedom. Comenius was an important leader of this group.

Regarding Comenius's childhood life, we still know very little. When he was twelve years old, both of his parents died, and his life was very difficult. He did not enter the Latin school in Přerov until he was sixteen. In 1610, because of his excellent academic performance, he was sponsored by the Brotherhood to enter the University of Herborn in Germany. After graduating, he traveled to the Netherlands, England, and other places to visit, and also attended lectures at the University of Heidelberg, which was famous for its progressive professors at the time. He returned to China in 1614.

After returning to China, Comenius devoted himself to education, serving as the principal of the Latin school in Přerov, where he had studied. In 1616, the Bohemian Brotherhood elected him as a pastor of the association. Later, he was elected as a bishop of the association. In 1618, he moved to Fulnek in Moravia to serve as a pastor and the principal of a new school.

In 1618, the Thirty Years' War broke out. The Czech army was defeated in the Battle of White Mountain (1620), and Spanish mercenaries suddenly attacked Fulnek, looting and burning everywhere and began to massacre non-Catholics. In 1624, Emperor Ferdinand II issued a decree ordering all non-Catholic believers to leave Bohemia and Moravia. Comenius was forced to flee, and he and several other members of the Czech Brotherhood hid in the Bohemian forests and mountains for several years. He lost all his property and all his manuscripts, and the widespread plague took the lives of his wife and two sons. Although his country was destroyed and his family was ruined, his will was strong, and he struggled arduously against the harsh environment for the educational cause of the motherland and the people.

In 1628, he and about 30,000 Czech Protestants had to leave their motherland and move to Leszno, Poland, with great pain. From then on, he fell into a foreign land and lived a wandering life for forty-two years, until he died in Amsterdam on November 15, 1670. He had been to England, Sweden, Hungary, the Netherlands and other countries to engage in educational work: on the one hand, educating members of the Bohemian Brotherhood who had fled abroad, and on the other hand, helping governments of various countries to open schools and compile textbooks. He hoped that through the governments of these countries, he could help the Czech Republic to liberate itself from the German conquerors. His efforts in education were mainly based on his patriotism. He once said, "What greater contribution can we make to the country than to teach and educate young people?" His love and loyalty to the cause of education, dedicating his whole life to the cause of education, can serve as an excellent model for educators.

In 1632, he wrote a great educational treatise – "Great Didactic". This book can be said to be the first "pedagogy" in the history of education. It systematically discusses the issues of education, upbringing, and teaching, laying the foundation for educational science. Its main content has become the essence and core of modern educational theory. In 1633, he compiled "Mother School", which is the first detailed educational outline for children under the age of six in human history. Comenius was one of the first educators to study the problems of pre-school and pre-school children's family education. In addition, he also compiled many other famous treatises and textbooks. Some textbooks, such as "The Gate of Languages Unlocked" and "Orbis Pictus", have been translated into many national languages and used as the best textbooks for classroom use and the best blueprint for compiling new textbooks for as long as 150 years, making great contributions to the cause of world culture and education.

He was the first to propose in detail the "principle of natural adaptability of education" and used it as the center of his educational thought. According to this principle, education must adapt to the laws of nature, including children's natural abilities and age characteristics. He was the first educator to attempt to discover the regularity of education and conduct education according to human nature. This is a major achievement of Comenius. This principle played a great positive role in the development of pedagogy in the 17th, 18th, and the first half of the 19th centuries, and was the foundation of the entire new education in Europe at that time. He shifted the center of education from adapting to the corrupt feudal social system to adapting to nature, attacking the previous practice of taking the "Bible" as the sole basis for educational theory, and enhancing the value of people and respect for the development of children's personality. In this regard, he deserves to be called the "Copernicus of modern education." However, at the end of the 19th century, this progressive educational theory was distorted by reactionary bourgeois educators and became a theoretical basis for reactionary "child-centeredness."

Comenius was the first to clearly propose the theoretical basis of the principle of intuitive education and systematically and widely apply this principle. According to his theory of sensation, he believed that "the beginning of knowledge always comes from the senses." He was very opposed to the scholastic teaching methods of reading dead books, reciting lessons by rote, and forced memorization at that time. He firmly advocated: "The teaching of words must be combined with things," and the development of students' language and thinking should be based on practical knowledge. Based on this principle, he compiled the world's first illustrated textbook – "Orbis Pictus", and suggested giving students as many opportunities as possible to visit, travel, and have more contact with real objects or nature.

Comenius also attached great importance to the principle of conscientiousness in education. He believed that education can only be carried out on the basis of children's conscious willingness. He quoted a famous saying from the ancient Roman educator Quintilian, saying: "The acquisition of knowledge lies in the will to learn, which cannot be forced." In order to arouse students' consciousness and enthusiasm for learning, he required teachers to take into account children's learning interests, abilities, and age characteristics, and should pay attention to the principles of systematicness and consistency in teaching – from simple to complex, from near to far, systematic and clear, consistent from beginning to end. At the same time, he also attached importance to the principle of consolidation in education. He said: "If the subjects we teach are not often given appropriate review, education cannot achieve thoroughness." He attached great importance to the inspection of students' academic performance, which was mainly based on the principle of consolidation.

Comenius was the first educator to put forward the great idea of ​​establishing a universal and compulsory school system that uses the students' native language for teaching. He said, "Not only the children of the rich and powerful should go to school, but all boys and girls in towns and villages, regardless of wealth or poverty, should go to school." At the same time, he also formulated a school system that would enable the entire new generation from six to twenty-four years old to be educated. His democratic idea of ​​educational equality broke the feudal hierarchical education system that was popular at the time, and had great progressive significance under the historical conditions at that time. He loved the motherland and the motherland's language, so he advocated that primary schools should be called "national language schools" and use the national language for teaching. This was also an innovation at the time.

He expressed dissatisfaction with the chaos, lack of unity, and completeness of the teaching content of schools at all levels at that time. Therefore, he attempted to compile "complete and concise courses" and teaching materials for schools at all levels based on his educational principle of "pansophia" (comprehensive wisdom), so that students could obtain general, complete, and useful basic knowledge. His "The Gate of Languages Unlocked" was written based on this principle. However, his thinking was also limited by the history of the time, especially his strong religious ideas, which regarded religion as a main purpose of education and listed religious subjects as compulsory subjects in schools at all levels. This was the biggest shortcoming in his thinking.

He opposed the individual teaching form used in schools at that time. He first clearly described and created the class teaching system, that is, gathering children of equal level in a fixed classroom to conduct collective teaching, so that more people can receive education at the same time. This system also conformed to the requirements of the times when the working people had more opportunities to study due to the development of industry and commerce. After Comenius advocated this system, the basic characteristics of this form have been retained to this day.

At the same time, he also stipulated many school work organization forms related to the class teaching system, such as: the school year and holiday system, the enrollment and promotion system, the time and hours of teaching, and the course examination system. These played a great positive role in improving the quality of school education.

Comenius also attached great importance to school discipline. He quoted a Bohemian proverb, saying: "A school without discipline is like a water mill without water." However, he opposed the severe discipline that was prevalent in schools at that time. He ridiculed schools at that time as "scarecrows that frighten children and torture chambers of wisdom." He demanded that schools abolish corporal punishment. He loved children, valued the development of children's personality, and believed that every child can be educated, and even children with poor qualities can be transformed by the power of education. His trust and love for children is worthy of our attention.

Comenius attached great importance to the work of teachers, believing that: the position of teacher is "no more superior under the sun than it." He called teachers "skilled sculptors" and "shining suns." However, he believes that education is a very complex task, "educating human beings is the art of arts," so he requires teachers to have rich knowledge, noble morals, and be a good example for students. The teacher's loyalty to the cause of education and love for children are important conditions for the success of teachers' education. He used his own example of engaging in education as a good example for teachers.

He was a warrior for peace. The ultimate goal of his lifelong efforts was to make society "see more light, order, peace and tranquility." He demanded that the people of all countries should treat each other with humanity, eliminate brutality, and stop wars. He was very opposed to the colonialism of European countries and condemned them for using violence to preach in foreign colonies. He once cried out loudly, "I also ask you to remember that we are human beings, we are born for humanity, not for brutality." "Put down your weapons and put on the clothes of peace... You have destroyed a lot, please try to restore your work!" In his seven-volume masterpiece "General Advice on the Correction of Human Affairs" (most of the manuscripts were not discovered until 1935), he put forward detailed and specific methods to achieve international peace. He suggested establishing three international cooperation institutions to ensure the peaceful coexistence between countries: in education and science, establish a "consultative council" to enable educators and scientists from various countries to cooperate to develop science and exchange information on various scientific discoveries and inventions; in religion, establish a "world religious court" to regulate all religious affairs; in politics, establish a "world supreme court", or call it a "cabinet of rulers of various countries" and a "world senate" to deal with important international political issues. Although this was just a fantasy at the time, in our movement to strive for world peace today, his anti-war and peace-advocating ideas still have great positive significance.

As early as the beginning of the 20th century, at the end of the Qing Dynasty, Comenius' educational thought had been introduced to China by Wang Guowei and others, so the Chinese education community is no stranger to the name Comenius. We express our heartfelt respect to this great Slavic educator and fighter who struggled for the friendship and peace of the people of all countries. (Attached picture)

    伟大的捷教育家——杨·阿·夸美纽斯
    北京师范大学教育系教授　陈景磐
    杨·阿·夸美纽斯（1592—1670年）是一位伟大的捷克爱国主义和民主主义的教育家。他的教育学说是斯拉夫人对世界文化一种最有价值的贡献。他是捷克民族独立的捍卫者，也是争取和平的勇敢的战士。今年是夸美纽斯的教育论著全集出版三百周年以及他的诞辰三百六十五周年。世界和平理事会把夸美纽斯列为今年纪念的世界文化名人之一。
    他天才地总结了他那时代先进的教育理论和实践，并根据他多年优秀的教育经验，创立了卓越的教育体系。当时教派的民主运动、培根的科学方法、文艺复兴的现实主义等先进思想，都在他的教育思想中得到反映。他奠立了现代教育科学的基础，被称为“教育科学的创始人”。
    他生活的年代正是欧洲社会进入一个大变动的时期：封建主义制度向资本主义制度急剧转化，阶级矛盾非常尖锐，许多被压迫的民族为争取独立自由进行不断的斗争。在西欧荷兰和英国发生了资产阶级革命，在乌克兰和白俄罗斯进行了为争取从波兰贵族压迫下解放出来的长期斗争；三十年战争（1618—1648）更是这个时代阶级和民族矛盾一个鲜明的例子。这种时代的矛盾，在他的生活上和思想上都起了极大的影响。
    夸美纽斯生在摩拉维亚的乌古尔勃罗德镇。他父亲是从事磨粉业的磨坊师，是当时一个爱国的、进步的团体——波希米亚兄弟会——的热心会员。这个团体是十五世纪光荣的太波尔派的后裔，继承了为争取宗教、民族和社会自由而斗争的“胡斯传统”。夸美纽斯就是这个团体重要的领导人。
    关于夸美纽斯幼年的生活，我们到现在为止知道的还很少。他在十二岁的时候，父母双亡，生活很苦，到十六岁才进了普利洛夫市的拉丁中学肄业。1610年，因他的学习成绩优异，得兄弟会的资助入德国的赫尔朋大学。毕业后，他就旅行到荷兰、英国等地去参观访问，并曾在当时以进步教授而著名的海得尔堡大学听课，1614年回国。
    回国后，夸美纽斯就献身于教育事业，在他过去念过书的那个普利洛夫市拉丁中学担任校长。1616年，波希米亚兄弟会选举他为该会牧师，以后，他又被选为该会主教。1618年，他迁移到摩拉维亚的富涅克城，担任该地牧师和一所新学堂的校长。
    1618年，三十年战争爆发。捷克军队在白山战役（1620年）战败，西班牙雇佣军突然袭击富涅克，到处劫掠、焚毁并开始残杀非天主教教徒。1624年，德皇斐迪南二世颁布法令，命令驱逐所有非天主教信徒都离开捷克和摩拉维亚。夸美纽斯被迫逃亡，他和其他几位捷克兄弟会的成员在波希米亚森林和深山中隐蔽了几年。他损失一切的财产和全部手稿，当时流行很广的瘟疫又夺去了他的妻子和两个儿子。他虽然国破家亡，但是他的意志坚强，为祖国为人民教育事业与恶劣的环境作了艰苦的斗争。
    1628年，他和捷克新教徒约三万户不得不忍痛离开了自己的祖国迁居到波兰的黎撒。从此，他沦落异乡，过了四十二年流浪的生活，一直到1670年11月15日，在阿姆斯特丹逝世。他曾到过英国、瑞典、匈牙利、荷兰等国从事教育工作：一方面教育逃亡在国外的波希米亚兄弟会会员，一方面帮助各国政府开设学校编写教科书等。他希望通过这些国家的政府，能够帮助捷克从征服者德国人手中解放出来。他努力于教育事业，主要地就是从他的爱国主义出发的。他曾说过，“我们对于国家的贡献，那里还有比教导青年和教育青年更好更伟大的呢？”他对教育事业的热爱和忠诚，一生为教育事业鞠躬尽瘁，可以作为教育工作者优良的模范。
  他在1632年写成了一本伟大的教育论著——“大教学论”。这本书可说是教育史上第一本的“教育学”，它系统地论述了教育、教养、教学各方面的问题，奠立了教育科学的基础，它的主要内容成了现代教育理论的精华和核心。1633年，他编写了一本“母育学校”，这是人类史上第一本关于六岁以下儿童的详细的教育大纲。夸美纽斯是最先研究先学龄前和学龄前儿童家庭教育问题的教育家之一。此外，他还编写了许多其他有名的论著和教科书。有些教科书，如：“语学入门”、“世界图解”，都译成许多国家语文，并充作课堂用的最优良的课本和编制新教科书的最优良的蓝本，时达一百五十年之久，对世界文化教育事业贡献极大。
    他第一次详细地提出“教育的自然适应性原则”，并以它作为他教育思想的中心。根据这个原则，教育必须跟自然的规律，包括儿童天赋的自然能力和年龄特征相适应。他是第一个企图发现教育的规律性并根据人的本性来进行教育的教育家。这是夸美纽斯一个重大的功绩。这种原则，在十七、十八世纪和十九世纪的前半期在教育学发展中曾起了极大的积极作用，是当时整个欧洲新教育的基础。他把教育的中心从适应当时腐朽的封建社会制度，转移到适应自然，打击了从前以“圣经”为教育理论的唯一根据，提高了人的价值和对儿童个性发展的尊重。在这一点上他无愧被称为“现代教育的哥白尼”。但在十九世纪末，这种进步的教育学说被反动的资产阶级教育家所歪曲，变成为反动的“儿童中心主义”的一种理论基础。
    夸美纽斯是第一个明确地提出教育直观性原则的理论基础，并且有系统地和广泛地应用这个原则的人。根据他的感觉论的思想，他认为“认识的开端永远是从感官来到的”。他非常反对当时读死书、死背课文、强迫记忆的经院式的教学方法。他坚决地主张：“文字的教学必须和事物相结合”，学生语言与思维的发展应当以实际的知识为基础。他根据这个原则编写了世界上最早的一本插图的教科书—“世界图解”，并建议尽量多给学生参观、旅行的机会，多让学生与实物或大自然接触。
    夸美纽斯对教育的自觉性原则也非常重视。他认为教育只能在儿童自觉自愿的基础上进行。他曾引证古代罗马教育家昆体良一句名言，说：“知识的获得在于求知的志愿，这是不能够强迫的”。为了引起学生对学习的自觉性和积极性，他要求教师应当顾到儿童学习的兴趣、能力及其年龄特征，并且应注意到教学的系统性、一贯性原则——由简到繁，由近到远，系统分明，前后一贯。同时，他也重视教育的巩固性原则，他说：“我们所教的科目如果没有常常予以适当的复习，教育便不能够达到彻底的境地。”他非常重视学生学习成绩的检查，这主要的也是从巩固性原则出发的。
    夸美纽斯是第一个提出建立普及义务的、用学生的本族语进行教学的学校体系的伟大思想的教育家。他说，“不独有钱有势的人的儿女应该进学校，而且所有城镇乡村的男孩和女孩，不论富贵贫贱，都应该进学校”。同时，他还制定了一套可以使六到二十四岁的整个新生一代都能受到教育的学校系统。他这种教育平等的民主主义思想，打破了当时流行的封建等级的教育制度，在当时历史的条件下是有极大进步意义的。他热爱祖国、热爱祖国的语言，所以主张初级学校应该称为“国语学校”，用国语进行教学。这在当时也是一种创举。
    他对当时各级学校教学内容的杂乱无章、缺乏统一性和完整性，表示不满。所以他企图根据他的“泛智”（全面智慧）的教育原则，为各级学校编制“完整的简明教程”和教学用书，使学生都能获得一般的、完整的和有用的基本知识。他的“语学入门”就是根据这个原则写的。但他的思想也受了当时历史所局限，特别是他的浓厚的宗教思想，把宗教作为教育的一种主要目的，并把宗教科目列为各级学校的必修科目，这是他思想中最大的缺点。
    他反对当时学校中所用的个别教学形式，他首先明确地叙述并创立了班级教学制度，即集程度相等的儿童在固定的教室里，进行集体教学，使更多的人能够同时受到教育。这种制度也是符合于当时因工商业发达，劳动人民有更多的读书机会的时代要求。这种制度经过夸美纽斯提倡以后，一直到现在还保留着这一形式的基本特征。
    同时，他还规定了很多与班级教学制度有关的学校的工作组织形式，如：学年与假期制度、招生和升级制度、授课的时间和钟点、课业考绩制度等。这些对学校教育质量的提高起了很大的积极作用。
    夸美纽斯对学校的纪律也很重视。他曾引用波希米亚一句谚语，说：“学校没有纪律便如水磨坊没有水”。但是他反对当时学校中盛行的严峻的纪律，他讥笑当时学校是“恐吓儿童的稻草人和智慧的拷问室”，他要求学校废止体罚。他热爱儿童，重视儿童的个性发展，并且认为每个儿童都可以受教，就是素质较差的儿童也可以用教育的力量加以改造。他对儿童的信任和热爱是值得我们注意的。
    夸美纽斯非常重视教师的工作，认为：教师的职务是“太阳底下再没有比它更优越的”。他称教师是“高明的塑像家”，是“照耀着的太阳”。但是，他认为教育是一种非常复杂的工作，“教育人类是艺术中的艺术”，所以他要求教师要有丰富的知识，高尚的品德，能为学生良好的范例。教师对教育事业的忠诚，对儿童的热爱，更是教师教育成功的重要条件。他以自己本身从事教育工作的实例，作为教师良好的榜样。
    他是一位和平的战士，他一生努力的最终目的，就是要使社会上“多见光明、整饬、和平与宁静”。他要求各国人民应当以人道相处，消除残暴，停止战争。他非常反对欧洲国家的殖民主义，谴责他们用暴力在国外属地中传教。他曾大声疾呼地说，“我还要求你们记住，我们是人，我们是为人道而生，不是为残暴而生。”“要把武器放下，要穿上和平的服装……你们所破坏的东西已经很多了，请尽力恢复工作吧！”在他的“改正人间事务的总的忠告”的七卷巨著（大部分的手稿在1935年才被发现）中，他详细地提出达到国际和平的具体方法。他建议设立三种国际合作机构来保证各国间的和平共处：在教育和科学方面，设立“建议会”，使各国的教育家、科学家进行合作，来发展科学和交换各种科学的发见和发明的情报；在宗教方面，设立“世界宗教法庭”，来调节一切宗教事务；在政治方面，设立“世界最高法庭”，或称之为“诸国执政内阁”和“世界元老院”，来处理国际间重要的政治问题。这在当时虽然不过是一种幻想，但在我们今日争取世界和平的运动中，他这种反对战争主张和平的思想还是有它很大的积极意义的。
    远在二十世纪初年，清朝末期，夸美纽斯的教育思想已经由王国维等人介绍到中国来，所以中国教育界对夸美纽斯的名字并不生疏。我们对这位伟大的斯拉夫教育家，为各国人民友谊和平而斗争的战士，表示衷心的敬意。（附图片）
