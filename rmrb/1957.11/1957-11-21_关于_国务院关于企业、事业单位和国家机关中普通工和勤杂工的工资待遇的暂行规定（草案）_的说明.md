Explanation of the "Provisional Regulations (Draft) of the State Council on Wage Treatment for Ordinary Workers and Handymen in Enterprises, Institutions, and State Organs"
　　Minister of Labor, Ma Wenrui

Ordinary workers and handymen are workers who only engage in simple manual labor. The former includes workers who dig, carry soil, and transport bricks, tiles, and lumber in the construction industry, and workers who transport raw materials, materials, and clean workshops in production factories and mines. The latter includes orderlies, service personnel, and messengers in enterprises and government offices. The current wage standards for these workers are sometimes stipulated by the State Council or the central competent departments, and sometimes by local authorities, and are generally somewhat high. For example, the wage standards for ordinary workers in the Beijing construction industry are 33.66 yuan to 50.75 yuan, and the wage standards for handymen are 23 yuan to 37.5 yuan. This is high whether compared with the labor income of skilled workers or farmers. If the wages of ordinary workers are added to piece-rate bonuses, then they are even higher. The result of the excessively high wage treatment for this part of the workers has stimulated farmers to flock to the cities, which is detrimental to both agricultural production and urban work. The purpose of formulating these regulations now is to reasonably stipulate the wage treatment for ordinary workers and handymen.

The regulations state that the wage standards for newly recruited formal and temporary ordinary workers in the construction industry should be stipulated in accordance with the principle of being equivalent to the income of farmers with relatively strong labor power in local general middle-level agricultural production cooperatives, plus the difference in urban and rural living expenses. This is because the labor of ordinary workers and the labor of ordinary farmers are both simple manual labor, and most ordinary workers are farmers who have just come from the countryside, so their labor remuneration should be roughly balanced. However, because the cost of living in cities is higher than in the countryside, the wages of ordinary workers should also include the difference in urban and rural living expenses. We believe that this provision can coordinate urban-rural and worker-peasant relations, and can avoid attracting farmers to blindly flow into cities or causing difficulties when workers need to be recruited from rural areas.

The regulations state that the wage standards for newly recruited handymen should be stipulated in accordance with the principle that the maximum should not exceed the wage standard of the thirtieth grade of the current wage standard table (1) for state organ staff. This is because the work of handymen is simpler and easier, so corresponding adjustments should also be made.

Ordinary workers and handymen have complex names and a wide range, and some are also workers who basically engage in simple manual labor. Whether they should also be classified as ordinary workers or handymen needs further consideration. Therefore, it is temporarily determined that these regulations only apply to ordinary workers in the construction industry and temporary ordinary workers in other enterprises, institutions, and government offices, as well as orderlies, service personnel, and general messengers in various departments. Supplementary regulations or separate regulations will be formulated for other personnel with similar jobs in the future.

Considering that ordinary workers and handymen are generally recruited locally and are a combination of workers and farmers, in order to make the wage treatment of these workers meet the local actual situation, it is determined in these regulations that the wage treatment standards for ordinary workers and handymen will be uniformly formulated by the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and will be uniformly implemented within the scope of the provinces, regions, and cities.

These regulations adopt the principle of "new standards for new recruits, old standards for old employees." The new standards apply to newly recruited ordinary workers and handymen in the future, and the original treatment for existing ordinary workers and handymen will not be changed. This can avoid reducing the income of these workers and can ensure that there are no difficulties in implementing these regulations.

    关于“国务院关于企业、事业单位和国家机关中普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定（草案）”的说明
　　劳动部部长　马文瑞
    普通工和勤杂工，都是只从事简单的体力劳动的工人，前者如建筑业中挖土、挑土、搬运砖瓦木料的工人，生产厂矿中搬运原料、材料和清扫车间的工人；后者如企业、机关中的勤务员、服务员和通讯员。这些工人的现行工资标准，有的是由国务院或者中央主管部规定的，有的是由地方规定的，一般的都有些偏高。例如北京市建筑业普通工的工资标准为33．66元至50．75元，勤杂工的工资标准为23元至37．5元，这无论是同技术工人或者同农民的劳动收入对比起来，都是高的。普通工的工资如果再加上计件超额工资等，那就更高。这部分工人的工资待遇偏高的结果，就刺激了农民纷纷进城，对于农业生产和城市工作都属不利。现在制定这个规定，目的就是要合理地规定普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇。
    这个规定中说，今后新录用的建筑业中正式的和临时的普通工的工资标准，应该以相当于当地一般中等农业生产合作社中劳动力较强的农民的收入加上城乡生活费用的差额为原则予以规定。这是因为普通工的劳动同一般农民的劳动都是简单的体力劳动，大多数普通工又是刚刚从乡村来的农民，所以他们之间的劳动报酬应该大体平衡。但是，因为城市的生活费用高于乡村，所以普通工的工资还应该加上城乡生活费用的差额部分。我们认为，这样规定，既可以协调城乡、工农关系，又可以避免吸引农民盲目流入城市或者在需要从农村中招工的时候发生困难。
    规定中说，今后新录用的勤杂工的工资标准，应该以最高不超过现行国家机关工作人员工资标准表（一）第三十级的工资标准为原则予以规定。这是因为勤杂工的工作更加简单和轻便，所以也应该作相应的调整。
    普通工和勤杂工，名称复杂，范围很广，有一些也是基本上从事简单的体力劳动的工人，是否也应该归入普通工或者勤杂工，还需作进一步的考虑。因此，暂先确定这个规定只适用于建筑业的普通工和其他企业、事业、机关中的临时普通工，以及各部门的勤务员、服务员和一般通讯员，而对于其他工作类似的人员，待以后再补充规定或者另作规定。
    考虑到普通工和勤杂工一般都是就地招收的，是工人和农民的结合部分，为了使这部分工人的工资待遇能够切合当地实际情况，因此，这个规定中确定今后普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇标准一律改由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会制定，在省、区、市范围内统一执行。
    这个规定采取了“新人新标准、老人老标准”的方针，新标准适用于今后新录用的普通工、勤杂工，对于原有的普通工、勤杂工，原来的待遇不予变动，这样，可以避免使这部分工人减少收入，并且可以使得在实行这个规定的时候不至于有什么困难。
