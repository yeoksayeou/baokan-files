The people of the capital, after attending the grand rally celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution on the evening of the 6th, proceeded to the Beijing Gymnasium for a grand celebration evening. At this event, hundreds of Soviet artists visiting China and actors from the capital's literary and art circles collaborated to perform many wonderful programs.

The first program of the evening was the chorus "Moscow-Beijing," which praised the fraternal friendship and close unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. When this famous song, conducted by Honored Artist of the Russian Federation Bukbinder, accompanied by the symphony orchestra of the Novosibirsk State Opera and Ballet Theater of the Soviet Union, and sung by more than two hundred Chinese chorus members, ended, the entire venue resounded with prolonged and enthusiastic applause. Subsequently, Chinese and Soviet artists jointly performed the famous Chinese chorus "Heroes Conquer the Dadu River," Glinka's "Glory Chorus," and Tchaikovsky's solemn "1812 Overture." The two countries' artists coordinated perfectly in their collaborative performances.

The Ballet Troupe of the Novosibirsk State Opera and Ballet Theater of the Soviet Union, which has already won a high reputation among the broad audience in China, received another long and enthusiastic cheer at tonight's evening. Tonight, People's Artist of the Russian Federation Tsimina and Honored Artist of the Russian Federation Klubinnina, among others, performed excerpts from the ballets "Swan Lake," "Don Quixote," and "Shore of Happiness," respectively. Four ballet dancers from the Beijing Dance School, personally trained by famous Soviet dancers, also participated in the performance of excerpts from the ballet "Swan Lake."

The "Tibetan Cavalry Dance," performed by Soviet ballet dancers, the "Marching Rest Dance," performed by Chinese dancers, which depicted the lively, humorous, and optimistic life of the Soviet Red Army, and the "Havoc in the Dragon Palace," performed by famous Chinese Peking Opera actors Li Shaochun and Guan Sushuang, all won lasting and enthusiastic applause from the audience.

The celebration evening, overflowing with Sino-Soviet fraternal friendship, lasted for more than two hours. After the performance, the Chinese and Soviet sides presented flower baskets to the artists of both countries. Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, as well as the Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, Gutikov, Soviet expert representatives Sudarikov, Glebov, and Kalinin, went to the center of the hall and shook hands with the Chinese and Soviet actors one by one, thanking them for their successful performances, and took group photos with the actors.

On the evening of the 6th, various sports performance competitions were also held simultaneously on the five brightly lit sports fields outside the Beijing Gymnasium, with nearly ten thousand spectators filling the stands. The famous "August 1st" men's basketball team defeated the Tianjin team with a score of seventy-nine to sixty-four.
