Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 30th -- The Standing Committee of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting on the 23rd and stipulated that in-service cadres would take turns going to the countryside in batches to participate in physical labor as a system. It is tentatively set that every cadre must go to the countryside for five days of labor during busy farming seasons such as summer harvest, autumn harvest, flood prevention and rescue, and drought resistance. In addition, when cadres are in contact with agricultural cooperatives, they should also participate in labor production in a planned way.

During the autumn planting season this year, there was a prolonged drought with no rain, and the drought situation was severe throughout the province. In order to ensure timely wheat planting, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions requiring each cadre to take turns going to the countryside to plant wheat for five days. According to preliminary statistics, more than 110,000 cadres from various levels of organs, people's organizations, and universities and colleges throughout the province participated in this activity, and a considerable number of them were responsible cadres at all levels.

    干部轮流下乡劳动　安徽省委定为制度
    据新华社合肥30日电　中共安徽省委23日举行的常务会议，把在职干部分批轮流下乡参加体力劳动规定为一项制度，暂定每逢农忙时节如夏收、秋收、防汛抢险、抗旱时，每个干部都要下乡劳动五天。此外，在干部联系农业社时，也应有计划地参加劳动生产。
    今年秋种时节，久旱不雨，全省旱象严重。中共安徽省委为了保证及时种麦，曾发出指示，要求每个干部轮流下乡种麦五天。据初步统计，全省各级机关、人民团体、大专学校有十一万多干部参加了这一活动，其中有相当一部分是各级负责干部。
