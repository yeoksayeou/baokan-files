Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 16th. Syrian Foreign Minister, Mr. Bitar, issued a statement on the evening of November 14th, strongly condemning the attitude taken by the United States and Western countries towards Syria in the United Nations.

In this radio statement broadcast on Damascus Radio, Bitar described in detail the various stages of Syria's accusation in the United Nations. He once again refuted all the absurd claims made by the United States and Turkey regarding Syria. He pointed out that all the fabricated claims about communist infiltration in Syria and the West's insistence that Syria is currently becoming a Soviet military base are nothing more than "pretexts for American intervention in Syria."

He also pointed out: "The Americans want to portray the Arab problem as part of the Cold War between the East and the West in the Middle East, but we refuted this claim. We say that the Arab problem is a fierce struggle between free Arabs and imperialism."

Bitar strongly condemned the "divide and rule policy" pursued by the United States in the Middle East. He also said: "Without a doubt, our foreign policy and our development are not in line with the imperialists' wishes, because our policies are clearly contrary to the imperialists' goals." He also said: "Western countries do not want any Arab country to achieve unity, freedom and development," and their so-called solution to the Middle East problem is to restore the status quo.

He pointed out that socialist countries and most Asian and African countries support our just position in the United Nations.

Finally, Bitar talked about the current situation in Syria. He said: "We believe that Turkey is under great pressure, and therefore, it is not easy to give up its provocative activities against Syria. I think our problem is not only a problem between us and those who want to maintain imperialist forces in our country, but an international problem."

    叙外长严斥美国分裂中东
    再次指出西方国家诬蔑叙利亚是制造干涉的借口
    感谢社会主义国家和大多数亚非国家的正义支持
    新华社大马士革16日电  叙利亚外交部长比塔尔11月14日晚上发表声明强烈地谴责美国和西方国家在联合国对叙利亚所采取的态度。
    比塔尔在大马士革电台发表的这篇广播声明中详细叙述了叙利亚在联合国提出控诉的各阶段经过。他再一次驳斥了美国和土耳其所提出的有关叙利亚的一切荒谬说法。他指出，关于共产党渗入叙利亚的一切捏造的说法以及西方所提出的硬说叙利亚目前正在变成苏联军事基地的说法，无非是“美国干涉叙利亚的借口”。
    他还指出：“美国人想把阿拉伯问题说成是东西双方在中东所进行的冷战的一部分，但是我们驳斥了这种说法，我们说，阿拉伯问题是自由阿拉伯人和帝国主义之间的激烈斗争。”
    比塔尔强烈地谴责美国在中东所奉行的“分而治之政策”。他并且说：“毫无疑问，我们的外交政策和我们的发展是不合帝国主义者的心意的，因为我们的政策显然是同帝国主义者的目的相抵触的。”他还说：“西方国家不希望任何一个阿拉伯国家获得统一、自由和发展”，他们所说的解决中东问题的办法是要恢复原状。
    他指出：社会主义国家和大多数亚非国家都在联合国支持我们的正义立场。
    比塔尔最后谈到了叙利亚目前的局势。他说：“我们认为，土耳其是处在很大的压力之下，因此，它是不容易放弃它对叙利亚所进行的挑衅活动的。我认为，我们的问题并不仅仅是我们同希望在我国保持帝国主义势力的人们之间的问题，而是一个国际问题。”（附图片）
