    Albanian People Celebrate Their Great Victory
    Balili, Ambassador of the People's Republic of Albania to China

    This November 28th, the Albanian people will celebrate the 45th anniversary of the declaration of national independence. The Albanian people are one of the oldest peoples in the Balkan Peninsula. But because it faces such an important geographical location in the Adriatic Sea, and because of its abundant products, it has constantly aroused the ambitions of invaders. In fact, for centuries, invaders have trampled and devastated our motherland. The Albanian people have responded to these acts of aggression with weapons. Because of this, we have maintained our national characteristics, our customs and the Albanian language. Among these invaders, the one that brought the greatest suffering to the Albanian people was Turkey. At the end of the fourteenth century, the Turkish Empire, which possessed the most powerful armed forces in the world at that time, invaded Albania after defeating the armies of the Balkan countries, and placed Albania under a barbaric rule for a full five hundred years. The Albanian people fought the enemy with amazing bravery. Finally, in the fifteenth century, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the national hero Skanderbeg, liberated their motherland. In the following twenty-five years, in order to live freely, the Albanian people repeatedly repelled the attacks of the Sultan's army, which was numerically superior. The ambitious Sultan always attempted to occupy tiny Albania. At that time, the victory of the Albanian people was welcomed throughout Europe, because this series of victories also defended European civilization and culture, protecting it from the destruction of the barbaric Turks. After Skanderbeg's death, the Turkish invaders occupied Albania. However, they were not able to suppress the resistance of the Albanian people. The national revival movement of the nineteenth century once again awakened the fighting will of the Albanian people.

    The Russian Revolution of 1905 greatly inspired the Albanian patriots to fight against the medieval feudal system and for liberation. The people's movement began to take on the nature of armed struggle. After the outbreak of the Balkan Wars in 1912, the chauvinists of our neighboring countries ordered their troops to invade Albania after defeating Turkey. Thus, the just liberation war of the Balkan countries, which had in the past and at that time opposed the common enemy Turkey together with the Albanian people, was transformed into an unjust war that violated the interests of the Albanian people. At such a moment of decisive significance for the fate of our people, and when all the Albanian people stood up, the patriotic diplomat Ismail Qemali and other patriots raised the national flag in the city of Vlorë on November 28, 1912, and declared Albania an independent state. This event greatly advanced the struggle of our people, and it was also a major turning point in our national history. Because of this, this day will forever be a great festival for the Albanian people. In the dark days after 1912, the Albanian people celebrated this great festival every year.

    Afterwards, Albania was still trampled and devastated by imperialists, but our people's national consciousness had begun to awaken and take shape. At that time, what was lacking in order to maintain a truly free and independent new Albania and to develop its economy and society in a progressive direction was a strong national leadership force.

    The government of Ismail Qemali failed to consolidate the newly established state because of the collusion between foreign and domestic feudal bourgeois groups and the extreme backwardness of the country at that time. Imperialists sent their rulers one after another, and also cultivated various agents in our country, with the aim of controlling the freedom-loving Albanian people. During the First World War, they also turned Albania into a battlefield.

    After the victory of the Great October Revolution, the Russian Workers' and Peasants' Government's newspapers published the secret Treaty of London signed in 1915. The Entente and Italy decided to partition Albania through the treaty. This event greatly shocked the Albanian people, so in 1920, the Albanian people launched an armed struggle against the foreign troops still remaining on Albanian soil. The people of Vlorë once again took up arms and wrote a heroic page in the struggle against Italian fascism. Finally, the enemy was repelled and driven out of their own country. The slogan of the whole people taking up arms to join the battle could be heard everywhere. In the north of Albania, we also drove out the Serbian army. After the national liberation, the national movement unfolded more vigorously in Albania. In 1924, the Albanian Parliament passed a resolution to mourn the death of Lenin with five minutes of silence, which was the only parliament in the world to pass such a resolution at that time. At the same time, the democratic government established in Tirana in June of that year was the most progressive government in the Balkan Peninsula at that time. It was one of the first governments in the world to recognize the Soviet Union and establish diplomatic relations with it.

    Western powers and Serbia took advantage of the unsoundness of the Albanian government at that time, cultivated and sent the executioner Ahmed Zogu, who seized power under the bayonets of Serbian and White Russian mercenary soldiers. Then, he immediately abolished all democratic and progressive things and declared himself king. During his fifteen years of rule, he implemented a policy of opening the door wide to his imperialist bosses. Finally, on April 7, 1939, he handed over the country to Mussolini's Italian fascists.

      The terrorist methods and demagogic propaganda carried out by Zogu during his rule not only did not weaken the democratic movement of the Albanian people, but on the contrary, this movement unfolded more universally and turned into a mass movement against Zogu. Later, this movement was combined with the revolutionary ideas spread by the Albanian communists among the workers and handicraft producers. In September 1943, German invaders replaced the Italian fascists in invading our country. The Albanian people greeted them with guns. For the freedom and independence of their motherland, the Albanian people continued to mount a tenacious resistance against fascist Germany for the next two years.

    In this series of struggles, the Albanian people were no longer as isolated and leaderless as in the past. Today, the national liberation struggle of the enslaved people is inspired by the glorious Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union. The Albanian people have been fighting under the unified leadership of the Albanian Communist Party. The Albanian Communist Party was founded on November 8, 1941, during the extremely difficult days caused by Germany's betrayal and attack on the Soviet Union, and is now renamed the Albanian Labor Party. Our country's National Liberation Front at that time also united the people of the whole country. Underground organizations, guerrilla detachments, battalions and divisions were everywhere in Albania. The fascist troops feared them like tigers. The poems of Naim Frashëri and other poets praised the glorious people and the independence of our motherland. These poems were loved by the people and guerrilla fighters, who often sang these poems in the anti-fascist struggle. On November 29, 1944, the day after the 32nd anniversary of the declaration of independence, and in the context of the continuous victories of the Soviet army, our National Liberation Army liberated all of Albania from the dying Nazi army.

    In this war, our people suffered considerable losses. 7.5% of the national population was sacrificed, 21% of the houses were burned down, one-third of the livestock died, agriculture and bridges were destroyed, and mines and the few factories that existed at that time were bombed. Despite this, the Albanian people achieved a victory that they had never achieved in thousands of years of history. We have the right to begin building our new democratic country. At the same time, for the beautiful life of the working masses, we began to build a socialist society. Regardless of the obstruction of the enemy, the Albanian people, with the assistance of our close friends the Soviet Union, the great People's China and other socialist countries, are victoriously building a socialist society. After liberation, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Labor Party and the democratic government, have transformed Albania from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country. Our country's economy is advancing at a rapid pace. Today, our country's industry has increased fourteen times compared to pre-war levels. Geological exploration has opened up broad prospects for our country's mining industry, especially the petroleum industry. The area of agricultural land has also expanded by 78% compared to pre-war levels, and production has increased by 84%. Today, we are rapidly establishing a great socialist mechanized agriculture. Culture and education have also made great progress. Illiteracy has been eliminated among people under the age of forty. This year alone, the number of middle school graduates is more than the total number of middle school graduates in the twenty-eight years under the old system. The National University of Tirana, established this year, has more than three thousand students. The living standards of the Albanian people have also improved considerably. All of this is like heaven and earth compared to the past.

    Today, Albania has established diplomatic relations with twenty countries in Europe, Asia and Africa, and has established trade relations with twenty-one countries. At the same time, it is a member of the United Nations and many international organizations. Our people and government have made and will continue to make every effort to further consolidate and develop friendly relations with the people of the world. On the other hand, we must make greater efforts to consolidate the socialist peace camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet Union, both in the past and now, has given enormous help to our people in their efforts to build a new life. The Soviet Union decided to give us two loans as gifts, with a total value of approximately 422 million rubles. Recently, the Soviet Union gave us another loan worth 160 million rubles. The Albanian people will forever be grateful to the Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its government. All this assistance from the Soviet Union has greatly supported the socialist economic construction of our independent country.

    The People's Republic of China has also given us enormous assistance, both in the past and now. The Albanian people have consistently regarded the friendship between themselves and the People's Republic of China as one of their greatest victories. This friendship is being consolidated day by day, and will continue to be consolidated in the future. Close cultural, economic and social ties have eliminated the geographical distance between our two countries. Today, the Albanian people and the Chinese people visit each other as closely as if they were in their own homes. The great People's Republic of China, under the leadership of its far-sighted and creative Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, is advancing rapidly and steadily. The People's Republic of China is an important force in the international arena, and the attempts by the imperialist countries, led by the United States, to deny its rights and all other conspiracies are doomed to failure, as in the past.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民庆祝自己伟大的胜利	阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国驻华大使　巴利里
    今年11月28日，阿尔巴尼亚人民要庆祝民族独立宣布的四十五周年。阿尔巴尼亚人民是巴尔干半岛最古老的人民之一。但由于它面临亚得利亚海这样一个重要的地理位置，以及其丰富的物产，都曾经不断地引起了侵略者的野心。而事实上几世纪以来，侵略者也一直践踏和破坏了我们的祖国。对于这些侵略行动，阿尔巴尼亚人民拿着武器给予了应有的回击。由于这样，我们才保持了自己民族的特性、自己的风俗习惯和阿尔巴尼亚语言。在这些侵略者中间，给阿尔巴尼亚人民带来最大的痛苦的是土耳其。十四世纪末，当时世界上拥有最强大的武装力量的土耳其帝国，在打败了巴尔干各国的军队以后，侵入了阿尔巴尼亚，并且在整整五百年内把阿尔巴尼亚处于一种野蛮的统治下面。阿尔巴尼亚人民则以惊人的勇敢向敌人展开了斗争。最后，在十五世纪，阿尔巴尼亚人民，在民族英雄斯坎德培格的领导下，解放了自己的祖国。在以后的二十五年内，为了自由地生活，阿尔巴尼亚人民曾多次打退了在数量上占多数的苏丹军队的进犯。野心的苏丹一直企图占领小小的阿尔巴尼亚。当时阿尔巴尼亚人民的胜利受到了全欧洲的欢迎，因为这一系列的胜利也保卫了欧洲的文明和文化，使其不受野蛮的土耳其的破坏。斯坎德培格逝世后，土耳其侵略者占领了阿尔巴尼亚。但是，他们并没有能够把阿尔巴尼亚人民的反抗镇压下去。十九世纪的民族复兴运动再一次地唤起了阿尔巴尼亚人民的战斗意志。
    1905年的俄国革命，大大地鼓舞了阿尔巴尼亚爱国者为反抗中世纪的封建制度以及为了解放而进行的斗争。人民运动开始带有了武装斗争的性质。1912年巴尔干战争爆发以后，我们邻国的沙文主义者命令他们的军队，在战败土耳其以后，侵入阿尔巴尼亚。这样，把过去和当时一直和阿尔巴尼亚人民一起反对共同的敌人土耳其的巴尔干各国人民正义的解放战争变成了一场非正义的违反阿尔巴尼亚人民利益的战争。在这样一个对我国人民的命运有着决定性意义的时刻，以及全体阿尔巴尼亚人民都站起来了的时候，爱国外交家依斯马尔·基马尔和其他爱国者，在1912年11月28日，在发罗那城高举国旗，并宣布了阿尔巴尼亚为一个独立的国家。这一事件使我国人民的斗争大大地向前推进了一步，同时它也是我国民族历史上的一个重大的转折点。由于这样，这一天就永远成为阿尔巴尼亚人民的一个伟大的节日。在1912年以后黑暗的日子里，每年阿尔巴尼亚人民也都要庆祝这一伟大的节日。
    以后，阿尔巴尼亚还是受到了帝国主义者的践踏和破坏，但是我国人民的民族觉悟已开始清醒和形成了。当时，要保持一个真正自由和独立的新阿尔巴尼亚，并使其经济和社会各方面朝着进步的道路发展所缺乏的是一个有力的国家领导力量。
    依斯马尔·基马尔政府没有能把新建立的国家巩固起来，其原因是国外和国内封建资产阶级集团的阴谋互相勾结和当时国内极端落后。帝国主义者一个接着一个派来了他们的统治者，同时还在我们国内培植了多种代理人，其目的不外是想控制爱好自由的阿尔巴尼亚人民。在第一次世界大战时，他们还把阿尔巴尼亚变成了战场。
    伟大的十月革命胜利以后，俄国工农政府的报刊公布了1915年签订的伦敦秘密条约。协约国和意大利通过条约决定了瓜分阿尔巴尼亚。这一事件大大地震动了阿尔巴尼亚人民，这样就在1920年，阿尔巴尼亚人民展开了武装斗争，反对那些还留在阿尔巴尼亚国土上的外国军队。发罗那的人民再一次拿起武器，第一个投入了战斗，他们在反对意大利法西斯的斗争中写下了英勇的一页。最后终于把敌人击退并赶出了自己的国土。全国人民拿起武器来投入战斗，这一口号到处都可以听到。在阿尔巴尼亚的北方，我们还赶跑了塞尔维亚军队。全国解放以后，民族运动在阿尔巴尼亚更澎湃地展开了。1924年，阿尔巴尼亚国会通过了以五分钟默哀来悼念列宁的逝世，这是当时世界上通过这种决议的唯一的国会。同时，在这一年6月，在地拉那建立的民主政府也是当时巴尔干半岛最进步的政府，它是世界上首先承认苏联并和她建立外交关系的政府之一。
    西方力量和塞尔维亚利用了当时阿尔巴尼亚政府的不健全，培养和派来了刽子手阿默德·索古，在塞尔维亚和白俄分子雇佣兵的刺刀下，他获得了政权。接着，他立刻废止了一切民主和进步的东西，并宣布自己为国王。在其统治的十五年内，他实行了为帝国主义老板们大开门户的政策。最后，在1939年4月7日还把国家让给了墨索里尼意大利法西斯。
      索古在其统治时期所实行的恐怖手段和蛊惑宣传都不但没有削弱阿尔巴尼亚人民的民主运动，相反的，这一运动更普遍地展开并转而变成反索古的群众运动。后来，这一运动更和当时阿尔巴尼亚共产党员在工人和手工业生产者中传布的革命思想相结合。1943年9月，德国侵略者代替了意大利法西斯侵入我国。阿尔巴尼亚人民则以手枪迎接了他们。为了自己祖国的自由和独立，在以后的二年内，阿尔巴尼亚人民一直向法西斯德国进行了顽强的反击。
    在这一系列斗争中，阿尔巴尼亚人民不再像过去那样孤立无援和缺乏领导的了。今天，被奴役人民的民族解放斗争，受到了光荣的苏联的伟大卫国战争的鼓舞。阿尔巴尼亚人民已经在阿尔巴尼亚共产党的统一领导下作战。阿尔巴尼亚共产党是在德国背叛向苏联进攻而造成的万分艰难的日子里，即1941年11月8日成立的，今天已改名为阿尔巴尼亚劳动党。我国当时的民族解放阵线也团结起了全国人民。阿尔巴尼亚到处是地下组织，是游击队的连队、营和师团。法西斯部队把他们看作像老虎一样的惧怕。纳依姆·法拉却尔和其他诗人们的诗歌歌颂了光荣的人民以及我们祖国的独立。这些诗歌受到了人民和游击战士们的热爱，他们在反法西斯的斗争中常常高唱这些诗歌。1944年11月29日，祖国宣布独立三十二周年的第二天，在苏联军队节节胜利的情势下，我国民族解放军从垂死的纳粹军队下，解放了全阿尔巴尼亚。
    在这一场战争中，我国人民遭到了相当严重的损失。全国人口的7．5％牺牲了，房屋烧毁了21％，牲畜死亡达三分之一，农业和桥梁被破坏，矿山和当时为数很少的工厂被炸了。尽管这样，阿尔巴尼亚人民获得了历史上千年来从未获得的胜利。我们有权利开始建设自己新的民主国家。同时，为了劳动群众的美好生活，我们开始建设社会主义社会。不管敌人的阻挠，阿尔巴尼亚人民，在我们的亲密的朋友苏联、在伟大的人民中国以及其他各社会主义国家的援助下，胜利地在建设社会主义社会。解放后，阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党和民主政府的领导下，已经把阿尔巴尼亚从一个落后的农业国变成了一个农业—工业国。我国的经济以迅速的步伐前进。今天我国的工业比战前增加了十四倍。地质勘探工作为我国采矿工业打开了广阔的前途，其中特别是石油工业。农业耕地面积和战前相比也扩大了78％，生产量增加了84％。今天，我们正在迅速地建立一个伟大的社会主义机械化的农业。文化和教育也获得了很大的发展。在四十岁以下的人中已扫除了文盲。仅仅是今年的中学毕业生就比旧制度下二十八年内中学毕业的学生总数还多。今年建立的国立地拉那大学有学生三千多。阿尔巴尼亚人民的生活水平也有了相当的提高。这一切和过去相比正如天上和地下。
    今天阿尔巴尼亚和欧洲、亚洲以及非洲的二十个国家建立了外交关系，和二十一个国家建立了贸易关系。同时，它又是联合国和很多国际组织的成员。我国人民和政府过去曾作过，而今后还将作种种努力，以进一步巩固和发展和全世界人民的友好关系。另一方面，我们要作更大的努力来巩固以苏联为首的社会主义和平阵营。
    苏联过去和现在，在我国人民为建设新生活而作的努力中，都给了巨大的帮助。苏联决定，把两项对我国的贷款作为礼物赠送给我们，其总价约值四亿二千二百万卢布。最近，苏联又给我们价值一亿六千万卢布的贷款。阿尔巴尼亚人民将永远感谢苏联人民、苏联共产党及其政府。苏联的这一切援助大大地支援了我们独立国家的社会主义经济建设。
    中华人民共和国无论在过去或现在也都给了我们巨大的援助。阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯把自己和中华人民共和国之间的友谊看作是自己最伟大的胜利之一。这一友谊日益在巩固，将来也还将不断地巩固。各种文化、经济和社会的紧密联系，消除了我们两国间地理上存在的距离。今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民彼此亲密地来往如在自己的家里一样。伟大的中华人民共和国，在其具有远见和创造性的中国共产党以及毛泽东主席的领导下，迅速地稳步地前进着。中华人民共和国是国际上一个重要的力量，以美国为首的帝国主义国家企图否认它的权利以及其他一切阴谋，像以往历次那样，是注定要失败的。
