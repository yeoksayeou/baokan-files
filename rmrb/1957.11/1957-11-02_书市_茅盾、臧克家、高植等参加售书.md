    "Book Fair"
    Mao Dun, Zang Kejia, Gao Zhi, and Others Participate in Book Sales
    Xinhua News Agency, 1st – The "Book Fair," set up in the ancient pine forest of the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, began receiving readers on the afternoon of the 1st. This was organized by the Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.
    This large-scale open-air "Book Fair" features more than 20,000 kinds of Chinese and foreign books, periodicals, and albums. Famous writers and translators from the capital participated in the book selling work here. Under the banner slogan "Welcome writers and translators to come among the readers!", groups of readers surrounded Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, who was wearing a "Book Fair Service Staff" badge on his chest and selling books in front of the bookcase. Many readers bought books such as "Midnight" and "Corrosion" from him, and some asked him to sign the books they bought as a souvenir. Poet Zang Kejia was also surrounded by crowds of people, and he kept fetching books and signing autographs for readers. In front of the bookcase of translated literary and artistic works, readers met the translator Gao Zhi, who is the translator of Tolstoy's famous work "War and Peace." On the first page of "War and Peace" bought by a soldier, he wrote: "Defend world peace and build a socialist motherland."
    At this unique "Book Fair," the crowds of people buying books were bustling. Next to the recommendation table for newly imported books, people scrambled to buy the latest published books such as "History of Sino-Soviet Friendship" and "The 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution." Many readers at the science and technology bookcase eagerly flipped through books introducing Soviet "artificial satellites" and "rockets."
    The "Book Fair" is scheduled to last for ten days. (Attached picture)
