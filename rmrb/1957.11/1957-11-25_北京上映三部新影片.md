    Three New Films to be Shown in Beijing
    Starting from November 26th, the following new films will be shown in various cinemas in Beijing.
        "Crossroads"
    This film has been popular for twenty years. It was produced by the Star Film Company, written and directed by the late famous director Shen Xiling, and starred Zhao Dan, Bai Yang, and others.
    The story depicts the experiences of a group of intellectuals in Shanghai in the 1930s. Unemployment and poverty threaten them; some become depressed, while others become stronger through training. Lao Zhao and Yang Zhiying, this pair of lovers who share hardships, also wake up after accepting the painful lessons of life, no longer wandering at the crossroads, but stepping forward on the path of struggle!
    The film's story is gentle and moving, with clear outlines and an orderly structure. The director's handling and the actors' performances are also perfect, making it a rare masterpiece.
        "The White Dog"
    The Soviet color film "The White Dog" is adapted from Kuprin's novel. It vividly recreates the life of wandering performers in the Tsarist era as depicted by the original author on the screen.
    Seryozha and his grandfather trek to Crimea, a resort for the nobility, full of fantasies. However, they encounter contempt and deception, and eventually meet a nobleman who believes that everything in the world can be bought with money and wants to force them to sell their white dog. When they refuse, he even steals it in a despicable manner.
    After a rather tortuous experience, Seryozha finally rescues the loyal white dog. They abandon all their original fantasies and hurry back on the road before dawn. Although the white dog has returned to its master's arms, and they have finally left this sinful place, who can determine their future destiny!
      "Ten Dollars"
    Of course, this did not happen today, but a long time ago in Hungary: A man returning from America has only ten dollars in his entire savings; but he is mistaken for a millionaire. Under the coercion of a young man eager to climb the social ladder, he is unable to clarify his true situation and has to act as a puppet, enduring the flattery and bootlicking of those noble officials, and the diligence and sycophancy of his relatives. Finally, the mystery is revealed, and everyone who depended on him and followed him leaves him.
    The film's story is very tortuous and bizarre, capable of captivating the audience, and also powerfully exposes the hypocrisy and shamelessness of the upper class. (Attached picture)

    北京上映三部新影片
    本月26日起，将有以下几部新影片在北京各影院上映。
        十字街头
    这部影片二十年来脍炙人口，是明星公司出品，已故著名导演沈西苓编导，赵丹、白杨等主演。
    故事描写了三十年代上海的一群知识青年的遭遇。失业和贫困威胁着他们，有的消沉了，有的经过锻炼坚强起来。老赵和杨芝瑛这一对共患难的恋人，在接受了惨痛的生活的教训后，也猛醒过来，不再彷徨在十字街头，而迈开脚步朝着战斗的途程前进了！
    影片故事娓娓动人，轮廓清晰，有条不紊，导演处理和演员表演也都很完美，实在是不可多得的佳作。
        “白狗”
    苏联彩色影片“白狗”是根据库普林的小说改编的。它生动地将原作者笔下所描绘的沙皇时代流浪艺人的生活重现在银幕上。
    谢廖沙和他的老爷爷，跋涉到贵族们避暑盛地克里米亚，他们对这里充满了幻想，可是遇到的却是被鄙视、欺骗，最后又遇到一个相信世界上没有任何东西是不可以用金钱买到的贵族，要强迫买他们的那只白狗。不成，他们竟卑鄙地偷着抢走了它。
    经过一段颇为曲折的经历，谢廖沙终于救出了那只忠诚的白狗，他们丢掉了原来的一切幻想，趁着天不亮就匆匆地又踏上了流浪的道路。白狗虽然重归了主人的怀抱，他们也终于离开这罪恶的地方，但谁又能决定他们以后的命运呢！
      “十块美金”
    当然，这不是发生在今天的事，而是发生在很久以前的匈牙利的事：一个从美国归来的人，他的全部积蓄只有十块美金；但是他却被误认为是一个大富翁。在一个一心想向上爬的青年人的胁迫下，他无法辩明自己的真实情况，不得不充作傀儡，忍受着那些贵族官吏的逢迎、拍马，忍受着自己亲戚的殷勤、谄媚。最后这个谜被戳穿了，于是一切依附着他、尾随着他的人又离开了他。
    影片的故事非常曲折离奇，能够引人入胜，对于上流社会的虚伪无耻也作了很有力的揭发。（附图片）
