Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 22nd. According to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper on the 21st, Egyptian Defense Minister Amir recently stated during talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow that Egypt cannot remain idle under the Western economic blockade.

"Al-Ahram" published a full-page report on the detailed talks and activities of General Amir in the Soviet Union. The report was written by "Al-Ahram" editor-in-chief Heikal, who accompanied Amir on his visit to the Soviet Union.

Heikal said in the report that during the talks between Egypt and the Soviet Union, Egypt clearly stated to the Soviet Union that Egypt hoped to become strong. Egypt has drafted a five-year industrialization plan that can be accelerated and completed within four years. The foreign aid that Egypt needs is more in the form of factory equipment and mining equipment, rather than cash. The entire plan is estimated to require £150 million, part of which can be raised domestically. Egypt does not want this factory equipment to be provided as a gift; it is willing to repay the price in installments after five years of delivery, using product income to pay.

Heikal also said that, politically, General Amir stated that Egypt's main policy is that Egypt safeguards the independence it has gained through hard work. The foundation of Egyptian foreign policy is active neutrality and Arab nationalism. "According to Egypt's understanding, its active neutrality is not to take advantage of the contradictions between major power blocs, nor is it to obtain a better bargaining position, nor is it a passive and selfish attitude of indifference to world affairs, but a policy of supporting what is right in all circumstances, and a practical way to consolidate peace."

Amir also said, "According to Egypt's understanding, Arab nationalism is not a doctrine that advocates religious fanaticism and advocates the establishment of a new empire, but an emotional, historical, and natural desire, and a tool for maintaining the common security of all countries whose people have shared destiny in the past, present, and future."

Amir also expressed that Egypt appreciates all the actions taken by the Soviet Union in all aspects to protect Egypt's interests. Egypt also appreciates the actions taken by the Soviet Union to protect Syria, as well as its consistent support for the liberation cause of the Arab world, Africa, and Asia.

    阿密尔将军曾在莫斯科时表示
    埃及感激苏联维护埃叙利益
    在西方经济封锁下埃及仍将大有作为
    新华社开罗22日电　据“金字塔报”21日报道，埃及国防部长阿密尔最近在莫斯科同苏联领导人会谈时曾经表示：在西方的经济封锁之下，埃及不能一无作为。
    “金字塔报”以整版的篇幅刊登了一篇关于阿密尔将军在苏联所进行的会谈和活动的详细情况的报道。这篇报道　是由随同阿密尔赴苏联访问的“金字塔报”总编辑黑卡尔写的。
    黑卡尔在报道中说，在埃、苏两国的会谈中，埃及向苏联明确地表明：埃及希望强盛起来。埃及已经草拟出来了一个工业化五年计划，这个计划可以加紧进行而在四年以内完成。埃及所需要的外来援助，更多的是工厂设备和采矿设备，而不是现金。全部计划据估计需要款项一亿五千万镑，其中一部分可以在国内筹措。埃及不希望这种工厂设备以赠与的方式提供；它愿意在交付设备五年以后分批偿还价款，以产品收入来支付。
    黑卡尔又说，在政治方面，阿密尔将军表明，埃及的主要政策是：埃及维护它经过千辛万苦而获得的独立。埃及外交政策的基础是积极中立和阿拉伯民族主义。“根据埃及的理解，它的积极中立并不是利用大国集团之间的矛盾，并不是取得更好的讨价还价的地位，也并不是一种对世界事务漠不关心的消极的自私态度，而是一种不论在什么情况下都支持正确事物的政策，是巩固和平的一种实际方法。”
    阿密尔还说，“根据埃及的理解，阿拉伯民族主义并不是一种崇尚宗教狂热而主张建立新帝国的教条，而是一种感情的、历史的和自然的愿望，也是维护在过去、现在和将来都具有共同命运的各国人民的共同安全的一种工具。”
    阿密尔还表示，埃及感激苏联在各方面所采取的维护埃及的一切行动。埃及也感激苏联为维护叙利亚而采取的行动，以及它一贯对阿拉伯世界、非洲和亚洲的解放事业的支持。
