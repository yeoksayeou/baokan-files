Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 20th (TASS dispatch): The "Chicago Daily News" published a four-page supplement introducing the development of the Soviet Union's economy, science, and culture.

	Edwin Leahy, the newspaper's correspondent in Washington, wrote in the supplement's editorial that if Russia was one of the most backward countries in Europe two generations ago, then "now the Soviet Union ranks second in the world in terms of power... Russia has completed a tremendous leap forward after the war and has become an industrial country..."

	The author said that the growth rate of Soviet industry is much faster than that of the United States, and the Soviet Union will overtake the United States in industrial production. Leahy quoted a "most authoritative government person" as saying: "If a depression occurs here, then our industrial advantage over the Soviet Union will quickly give way to them."

	Science commentator Arthur Snyder wrote in an article entitled "Soviet Science Gradually Becoming a Giant" that two Soviet satellites showed the rapid development of Soviet science, especially in physics.

	"Chicago Daily News" literary critic Van Allen Bradley admitted that "the number of Soviet books printed is more than that of the United States."

	The supplement's conclusion was an article entitled "Summary" by Paul Arthur, a professor of philosophy at Northwestern University. The article said, "The Soviet Union has undeniably defeated the United States in certain areas of theoretical science, including nuclear science, in applied science, engineering construction, mass science education, foreign language studies, equal educational opportunities based on intellectual development, peaceful propaganda, and shortening the 175-year industrial revolution to forty years. These facts cannot be denied."

	The author called on the United States to "trust in moral and spiritual wealth, and not be obsessed with weapons of mass destruction, and should learn to create, not destroy."

    “芝加哥每日新闻”介绍苏联
    承认苏联力量强大
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社纽约19日讯：“芝加哥每日新闻”出版了四页副刊，介绍苏联经济、科学和文化的发展。
    该报驻华盛顿记者埃德温·累希在副刊的社论中写道，如果说俄国在两代以前是欧洲的一个最落后的国家，那末“现在苏联在威力方面已在世界上占居第二位……俄国在战后完成了巨大的跃进，变成一个工业国……。”
    这位作者说，苏联工业的增长速度比美国快得多，苏联在工业生产方面将赶过美国。累希援引一位“最权威的政府人士”的话说：“如果我们这里出现萧条，那么我们在工业上对苏联的优势将会很快地让位给他们”。
    科学评论员阿瑟·斯奈德在一篇题为“逐渐成为巨人的苏联科学”的文章中写道，两颗苏联卫星显示了苏联科学，特别是物理学方面的迅速发展。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”文艺评论员范艾伦·布莱德雷承认，“苏联书籍印行册数比美国多”。
    副刊的结束语是西北大学哲学教授保罗·阿瑟写的一篇题为“总结”的文章。文章说，“苏联在理论科学的某些领域，包括原子核科学，在应用科学、工程建筑、群众的科学教育、外国语的研究，在智力发展的基础上平等受教育的机会、和平宣传以及把一百七十五年的工业革命缩短为四十年等方面无可争辩地击败了美国。这些事实不容否认。”
    作者呼吁美国“应当信赖道义和精神财富，而不要醉心于大规模毁灭性武器，应当学会创造，而不是毁灭。”
