(Reported by Tianjin Daily) The state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, in streamlining its organization, implemented the mass line, mobilizing all cadres to discuss and study, overcoming the conservative thinking of some leaders, and formulating a plan for streamlining the organization.

In mid-October, when the factory began discussing the issue of streamlining the organization, some leading cadres emphasized that the factory's products were complex, the trial production tasks and new design tasks were numerous, and the number of cadres was less than that of similar machinery factories. Therefore, they believed that there was no "fat" to be squeezed out of streamlining the organization. In response to this situation, the factory's Rectification Leadership Group first organized leading cadres to conduct discussions on how to treat the issue of streamlining the organization with a revolutionary spirit.

In order to ascertain the extent of organizational bloat, the Rectification Leadership Group also organized an investigation team to investigate the situation of the Production Planning Section, the Supply and Marketing Section, and the No. 1 Workshop. These three units had relatively large organizations, heavy tasks, and had previously complained about a lack of cadres; however, preliminary investigation results showed that among the 115 cadres in these three units, at least 23 people did little or no work. A planner in the No. 1 Workshop told the investigators that he only had five formal tasks a year—one annual plan and four quarterly plans. Adding in the daily miscellaneous tasks, he only needed an average of one hour and forty minutes a day to complete all the work. The Rectification Leadership Group promptly reported the results of this investigation to leaders at all levels and organized several discussions.

Through discussions, leaders at all levels recognized the importance and necessity of streamlining the organization. Some cadres who had previously emphasized difficulties and believed that there was no "fat" in streamlining the organization also admitted that they had bureaucracy and did not understand the actual situation. For example, the head of the Technical Inspection Section used to say every day that there were not enough cadres and asked the factory director to add three people to their section; after discussions, he went back and carefully examined the work in the section. He found that if some work procedures were simplified and the cadres' working hours were properly allocated, and if the section head did the work that he should be doing himself, then ten people could be reduced from the existing twenty-three cadres in the entire section.

Next, the factory's Rectification Leadership Group mobilized all cadres to discuss how to do the specific work of streamlining the organization, and based on the opinions put forward by everyone in the discussions, drafted a preliminary plan for streamlining the organization, and then submitted it to the cadres of each section and workshop for discussion and formulation of specific plans for each unit. During the discussion process by the cadres of each section and workshop, the idea that "more people make things easier" reappeared. They tried their best to keep more people, and the specific plans they formulated were relatively conservative.

At this time, the Rectification Leadership Group convened the most active members who were familiar with the business of each section and workshop to discuss whether the plans of their own units were conservative. These active members carefully calculated the workload and expected work efficiency of each person, and dug out a lot of potential, which powerfully persuaded the leading cadres of each unit. For example, when the Equipment and Power Section planned to reduce the number of people from the original thirty-five to twenty-three, the section head thought that "there are too few people, it won't work." After the active members studied it, they found that not only was there no problem, but two more people could be reduced.

After a series of discussions and studies, the factory's plan for streamlining the organization has been formulated. The original fifteen sections will be merged into thirteen, the number of management cadres will be reduced from the original 16.21% of the total number of employees to 10.96%, and 30.63% of all cadres will be transferred to workshops or rural areas to participate in manual labor production.

    谁说紧缩机构没有“油水”？
    天津纺织机械厂调查实际情况发动群众讨论
    打破领导人员的保守思想下放干部三分之一
    本报讯　据天津日报报道：国营天津纺织机械厂在紧缩机构中贯彻执行群众路线，发动全体干部讨论研究，克服了某些领导干部的保守思想，制订出紧缩机构的方案。
    10月中旬，这个厂开始讨论紧缩机构问题时，有些领导干部强调自己厂里产品复杂、试制任务和新设计任务多，而干部数量却比同样的机器厂少，因此认为紧缩机构没有什么“油水”。根据这种情况，该厂整风领导小组首先组织领导干部开展了怎样以革命精神对待紧缩机构问题的讨论。
    为了摸清机构臃肿的底，整风领导小组还组织了一个调查组，调查了生产计划科、供销科和第一车间三个单位的情况。这三个单位都是机构较大、任务较重、过去都喊叫干部不够的单位；但是初步调查的结果表明：这三个单位的一百一十五个干部中，至少有二十三个人工作不多或者没有工作可作。第一车间的一个计划员对调查的人说：他一年只有五次正式工作——一次年度计划和四次季度计划，加上日常的零星任务，他平均每天只要一小时零四十分钟就可以作完全部工作。整风领导小组把这次调查的结果及时向各级领导干部作了介绍，并组织了几次讨论。
      经过讨论，各级领导干部认识了紧缩机构的重要性和必要性。有些过去强调困难、认为紧缩机构没有“油水”的干部，还承认自己有官僚主义，不了解实际情况。如技术检查科科长以前天天说干部不够，要求厂长给他们科里增加三个人；这次经过讨论以后，回去认真地检查了科里的工作，结果发现如果简化一些工作手续，适当调配一下干部的工作时间，科长应作的工作由科长亲自动手，全科现有的二十三个干部中还可以减少十个人。
    接着，这个厂的整风领导小组又发动全厂干部讨论如何做好紧缩机构的具体工作，并且根据大家在讨论中提出的意见，拟出了紧缩机构的初步方案，又交各科室、车间干部讨论并制订各单位的具体方案。在各科室、车间干部讨论过程中，有些干部“人多好办事”的思想又冒出头来，他们尽力争取多留人，订出的具体方案比较保守。
    这时，整风领导小组就召集各科室、车间的最熟悉业务情况的积极分子来讨论自己单位的方案是否保守，这些积极分子细致地核算了每人的工作量和应有的工作效率，又挖出不少潜力，有力地说服了各单位的领导干部。如设备动力科预计由原有的三十五个人减至二十三个人时，科长就认为“人少，不行了”。经过积极分子研究，不仅没有问题，而且还可以再减去两个人。
    经过一系列的讨论、研究，这个厂紧缩机构的方案已经制定出来。原有的十五个科室将合并为十三个，管理干部将由原来占职工总数16．21％减至10．96％，占全体干部30．63％的人员将下放到车间或农村去参加劳动生产。
