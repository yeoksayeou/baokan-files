    A Section of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway to be Duplicated

    The double-track project for the Wuchang-Hengyang section of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway has been surveyed and designed by the Fourth Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways. The surveying work lasted more than seven months.

    This section of railway is 560 kilometers long. In addition to the trains on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway passing through here, trains on the Xiang-Gui, Zhe-Gan, and Xiang-Qian Railways also run on this line. Furthermore, with the increase in vehicles after the opening of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the development of industrial and mining enterprises along the line, the transportation on this section will inevitably become increasingly busy and strained. In order to meet the needs of transportation tasks, the state plans to build double tracks on this section of the line.

    While building the double track, the railway department will also carry out a thorough technical transformation of this section of the line. The original construction standards of the Wuchang-Zhuzhou section were extremely low. Although many technical transformations have been carried out since liberation, the original shortcomings have not been fundamentally eliminated. Through this technical transformation, transportation capacity will be greatly improved. (Xinhua News Agency)

    京广路将修一段复线
    北京—广州铁路武昌至衡阳段的复线工程，已经由铁道部第四设计院勘测完毕。勘测工作进行了七个多月。
    这段铁路全长五百六十公里，除北京—广州铁路的列车通过这里以外，还有湘桂、浙赣和湘黔等铁路的列车行驶在这段线路上，再加上武汉长江大桥通车以后车辆的增加和沿线工矿企业的发展，这段线路的运输必将日趋繁忙和紧张。为了适应运输任务的需要，国家计划在这段线路上建设复线。
    在兴建复线的同时，铁道部门还要对这段线路进行彻底的技术改造。武昌至株洲段线路原来的建筑标准极低，解放以后虽进行了许多技术改造，但仍未能根本消除原有的弊病。通过这次技术改造，运输能力将大大提高。（新华社）
