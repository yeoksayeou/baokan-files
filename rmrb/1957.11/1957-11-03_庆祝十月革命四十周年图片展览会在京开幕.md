Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The opening ceremony of the "Photo Exhibition Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution" was held in the Sun Yat-sen Hall of Zhongshan Park in Beijing on the morning of the 2nd.

Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Deputy Foreign Minister Zeng Yongquan, Deputy Minister of Culture Liu Zhiming and others attended the opening ceremony.

Also invited to attend the opening ceremony were Gu Tikov, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, and embassy staff.

Wu Yuzhang, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee for the Chinese People's Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered the opening speech. He said that the exhibition opening today, through pictures, systematically and vividly demonstrates the great achievements of Soviet construction, the high material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people, and the profound friendship of the Soviet people towards China. The opening of the exhibition not only adds splendor to the festival, but also points out a magnificent vision for our country's ongoing socialist construction once again.

Wu Yuzhang said that the two sets of pictures exhibited here, "The Life of the Soviet People" and "The Friendship of the Soviet People towards China," were presented by the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. The 546 sets of Soviet stamps exhibited since 1921 were specially prepared by the Soviet Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. He expressed his gratitude to the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Soviet Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications on behalf of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

Sudarikov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, then spoke. He said that the exhibition opening today is part of the tremendous work done by China in celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. The exhibition once again shows that this celebration has become a powerful manifestation of the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Soviet and Chinese people. Not long ago, the Soviet people widely commemorated the 8th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in their own country. In those days, the Soviet people were also proud of the great achievements made by the Chinese people. The achievements of the Soviet and Chinese people symbolize the triumph of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism and its invincibility, and symbolize the correctness of the path pointed out by the October Socialist Revolution to the working masses of the world.

After the opening ceremony, Vice Chairman Zhu De and Vice Premier Chen Yi and others visited the exhibition. After visiting the exhibition, Vice Chairman Zhu De also wrote an inscription in the guest book: Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

Today, among those who attended the opening ceremony were Li Jishen, Liao Chengzhi, and Shao Lizi, vice presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Chen Shutong, member of the Preparatory Committee for the Chinese People's Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution; Zhang Youyu, director of the Preparatory Committee for the Beijing Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and Deputy Mayor of Beijing; Zhang Xiruo, Cao Jinghua, and Lao She, vice presidents of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; and more than 500 people from all walks of life in the capital.

Personnel from the embassies of socialist countries in China were also invited to attend the opening ceremony. (Attached picture)
