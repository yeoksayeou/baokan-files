Xinhua News Agency, November 7th dispatch: TASS, Moscow, November 6th: Letter from the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the Working People, Political and Social Activists, Figures in Science and Culture, Parliaments and Governments of All Countries in the World:

Forty years ago, while the World War was raging, the world's first socialist state of working people was born in Russia. Its first legal document was the historic "Decree on Peace" personally signed by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Shortly thereafter, the Soviet state put forward a program for establishing truly equal and fraternal relations between all nations in the "Declaration of Rights of the Peoples of Russia."

This laid the foundation for a new, unprecedented foreign policy – the policy of the working class, of all working people who are deeply concerned about establishing peace and friendship among all nations. This inaugurated the Leninist peace-loving foreign policy of the Soviet state.

The young Soviet Republic, not yet consolidated but full of confidence in the historical righteousness of its cause, proposed peace and cooperation to all countries. At that time, counter-revolutionary forces attacked it and organized armed intervention, but the Soviet Republic proved that it was good at defending itself and safeguarding the achievements of socialism.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet Union has realized great transformations, and now it has become a powerful socialist country, its strength is vigorously developing, and it has reliable friends all over the world.

Today, forty years after the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets approved the "Decree on Peace," the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics solemnly calls on the people of all countries to tirelessly consolidate the cause of peace and strive to develop friendship and cooperation among the people of all countries.

The socialist state of working people defends the cause of peace. Aggressive ambitions are alien to it, it does not need colonies and spheres of influence, and by its very nature, it opposes any enslavement and national oppression.

The Great October Socialist Revolution opened up an era for all working people to break free from exploitation and for oppressed nations to break free from the shackles of colonialism. The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union sympathize with the liberation movements of the people in colonial and dependent countries and deeply understand their desire for national independence and to save their natural wealth from the plunder of imperialist monopoly capital.

The first half of the 20th century was marked by a number of events of world historical significance that had a huge impact on the fate of all mankind. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China are the greatest historical events after the Great October Revolution. The working people of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia have all embarked on the road of building socialism. The people of these nations have established relations of fraternal friendship and mutual assistance on the basis of equality and on the principles of socialist internationalism.

The socialist era, which outstanding thinkers of mankind have longed for for centuries, has arrived. It has promoted a powerful upsurge in productivity, a consistent improvement in the welfare of working people, and the vigorous development of science, technology, and culture.

All progressive people are warmly congratulating the Soviet Union on the successful launch of artificial earth satellites, which marks the beginning of the era of interstellar transportation. The Soviet people are heartily pleased with this, but we also understand that only under conditions of international peace can the greatest scientific achievements – the utilization of atomic energy, intercontinental rockets, and earth satellites – serve and benefit all mankind.

The people of all countries need peace, and the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union also need peace to build a brighter and better new future.

Unfortunately, the Soviet Union's peace policy is often met with opposition from powerful groups in Western countries, especially the United States. The ruling groups in these countries harbor ambitions to lead the world, that is, to rule the world. Naturally, no freedom-loving nation will agree to any foreign rule that leads to the loss of national independence. The Soviet state has never sought to lead other countries in the past and does not seek to do so now. It respects the independence and sovereignty of all countries and hopes to develop friendly relations with all countries. It warmly embraces and supports the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence: mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. These principles have been widely recognized by the people of Asian and African countries, who have already achieved great victories in the struggle for freedom, independence, and consolidation of peace.

The people of India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Ceylon, Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria, and many other countries are making great contributions to the prevention of new wars and to the great and noble cause of safeguarding peace. The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are extremely pleased to note that the people of socialist countries are consistently and unyieldingly fighting for peace together with the Soviet people.

Many non-socialist peace-loving countries and the great world peace movement are also actively striving for world peace.

But there is still a force in the world that hinders the relaxation of international tensions, wages the Cold War, and continues to expand armaments and create the danger of new destructive wars.

Peace must be guaranteed. Peace can only be guaranteed by uniting all peace-loving forces, strengthening their organization, and increasing their activity.

Workers and peasants, scientists and cultural figures, members of parliament of all countries! Eliminating the threat of new wars and establishing lasting peace depends on ourselves, on our joint efforts.

Good people! You have the power to restrain those politicians and government leaders who disregard the interests of the people of all countries and manipulate the fate of the people. It is time to abandon the "position of strength" policy and replace it with a policy of peaceful coexistence, a policy of building international trust and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries.

We, the representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, deeply believe that these sentiments will be widely echoed in the hearts of all those who cherish international peace and friendship.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union calls on the people of all countries in the world, all workers and peasants, figures in science and culture, political and social activists, parliaments and governments:

Persistently strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and for international cooperation;

Strive for universal disarmament and reduction of troops, and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons;

Strive to reach an agreement on the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests;

Establish a system of collective security in Europe and Asia;

Strive to develop economic and cultural ties between countries and strengthen international trust.

Conscious of its responsibility and the full gravity the current international situation, The Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics calls on all peace-loving people to actively engage in activities to prevent new wars.

The cause of peace is in the hands of the people themselves!

People of all countries, unite and fight for world peace!

Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
November 6, 1957, Moscow

    苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命节会议闭幕
    呼吁各国人民把和平事业掌握在自己手里
    本报综合消息　据新华社莫斯科7日电：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院庆祝十月革命四十周年的联席会议，6日晚上八时半（莫斯科时间）庄严地宣布闭幕。
    在下午和晚上的会议上，中国代表团团长毛泽东同志讲话之后，接着讲话的有：波兰代表团团长哥穆尔卡同志、捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长诺沃提尼同志、民主德国代表团团长乌布利希同志、罗马尼亚代表团团长斯托伊卡同志、保加利亚代表团团长日夫科夫同志、南斯拉夫代表团团长卡德尔同志、匈牙利代表团团长卡达尔同志、越南代表团团长胡志明同志、阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长霍查同志、朝鲜代表团团长金日成同志、蒙古代表团团长达姆巴同志。他们一致强调指出了十月革命的世界历史意义以及加强同苏联的友谊、加强社会主义国家的团结的重要性。（详情见第四版）
    苏联最高苏维埃联盟院主席洛巴诺夫致答词，他向各国代表团的祝贺表示感谢。
    会议最后通过了苏联最高苏维埃告苏联人民书（全文见第四版）和告世界各国劳动人民、政治和社会活动家、科学和文化界人士、议会和政府书。
    新华社7日讯　塔斯社莫斯科6日电：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃告世界各国劳动人民、政治和社会活动家、科学和文化人士、议会和政府书：
    四十年前，在世界大战打得正激烈的时候，在俄国诞生了世界第一个劳动人民的社会主义国家，它的第一项法律文件就是弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁亲手签署的有历史意义的“和平法令”。此后不久，苏维埃国家就在“俄国各民族权利宣言”中提出了建立各民族真正平等友爱关系的纲领。
    这样就给历史上前所未有的新的外交政策——工人阶级、切身关心建立和平和各国人民友谊的全体劳动人民的政策——奠定了基础。这样就创始了苏维埃国家的列宁主义的爱好和平的外交政策。
    当时尚未巩固但对自己的事业的历史正义性充满信心的年轻的苏维埃共和国，向一切国家提出了和平和合作的主张。当时反革命势力向它进攻，组织了武装干涉，但是苏维埃共和国证实了，它善于保卫自己，捍卫社会主义成果。
    苏联在共产党的领导下实现了伟大的变革，现在它已经成了一个强大的社会主义国家，它的力量蓬勃焕发，它在全世界有着可靠的朋友。
    在批准“和平法令”的第二次全俄苏维埃代表大会已经过去了四十年的今天，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟庄严地号召各国人民不倦地巩固和平事业、尽力发展各国人民的友谊和合作。
    劳动人民的社会主义国家捍卫着和平事业。侵略野心同它是格格不入的，它不需要殖民地和势力范围，由于它自己的本性，它反对任何奴役和民族压迫。
    伟大十月社会主义革命打开了全体劳动人民摆脱剥削、被压迫民族摆脱殖民主义桎梏的时代。苏联各族人民同情殖民地和附属国人民的解放运动，深刻理解他们要求民族独立、从帝国主义垄断资本的掠夺中挽救自己的天然财富的愿望。
    二十世纪上半叶的标志是发生了一些对全人类命运产生巨大影响的具有世界历史意义的事件。中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的建立，是继伟大十月革命后最大的历史事件。阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、越南民主共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫的劳动人民，都走上了建设社会主义的道路。这些国家的人民在平等的基础上，在社会主义国际主义原则的基础上，建立了兄弟友谊和互助的关系。
    人类优秀的思想家多少世纪来所向往的社会主义纪元到来了。它促成了生产力的强大高涨，劳动人民福利的一贯提高，科学、技术和文化的蓬勃发展。
    一切进步的人士都在热烈地祝贺苏联成功地发射人造地球卫星，这标志着星际交通时代的开始。苏联人为此感到衷心的高兴，但是我们也懂得，只有在国际和平的条件下，最伟大的科学成就——原子核能的利用、洲际火箭、地球卫星——才可能服务并造福于全人类。
    各国人民需要和平，苏联各族人民也需要和平，来建设更加光明美好的新的未来。
    遗憾的是，苏联的和平政策经常遇到西方国家、首先是美国有势力集团的反对。这些国家的统治集团怀有领导全世界、即统治世界的野心。自然，没有一个爱好自由的民族会同意导致民族独立丧失的任何外来统治。苏维埃国家在过去和现在从来也不企求领导其他国家。它尊重所有国家的独立和主权，并希望同所有国家发展友好关系。它热烈拥护并支持著名的和平共处五项原则：互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处。这些原则得到了在争取自由、独立和巩固和平的斗争中已经获得巨大胜利的亚非各国人民的广泛承认。
    印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、阿富汗、埃及、叙利亚以及其他许多国家的人民对防止新战争、对保卫和平的伟大和崇高的事业各自作出巨大贡献。苏联各族人民极为满意地指出，社会主义各国人民正在同苏联人民一道始终不渝地、不屈不挠地为和平而奋斗。
    许多非社会主义的爱好和平的国家和伟大的世界和平运动也都在积极地争取世界和平。
    但是世界上还有一股势力，它阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，进行冷战，继续扩充军备和制造新的毁灭性战争的危险。
    和平应当得到保证。只有通过团结一切爱好和平的力量、加强它们的组织和提高它们的积极性，和平才能得到保证。
    各国工人和农民、科学家和文化界人士、议会议员们！消除新战争的威胁和建立持久和平，要依靠我们自己，要依靠我们共同的努力。
    善良的人们！你们有力量约束不考虑各国人民利益和摆布人民命运的那些政界人士和政府领导人。是时候了，应该抛弃
  “实力地位”政策，而代之以和平共处政策、建立国际信任和各国人民友好合作关系的政策。
    我们苏联最高苏维埃代表深深相信，这种思想感情在所有珍视国际和平和友谊的人们的心中，必将获得广泛的响应。
    苏联最高苏维埃呼吁世界各国人民、全体工人和农民、科学文化界人士、政治和社会活动家、议会和政府：
    坚持不懈地为争取不同社会制度的国家和平共处、为国际合作而奋斗；
    争取普遍裁减军备和军队、禁止原子武器和氢武器；
    争取就立即停止原子武器和氢武器试验达成协议；
    建立欧洲和亚洲集体安全体系；
    努力发展各国之间的经济和文化联系，加强国际信任。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃意识到自己的责任和目前国际局势的全部严重性，呼吁所有爱好和平的人民积极展开防止新战争的活动。
    和平事业掌握在人民自己的手里！
    各国人民，团结起来，为世界和平而斗争！
          苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃
                        1957年11月6日于莫斯科
