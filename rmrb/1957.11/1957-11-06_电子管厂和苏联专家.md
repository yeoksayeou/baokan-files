Electronic Tube Factory and Soviet Experts
Zhou Fengming, Director of Beijing Electronic Tube Factory

All the employees of our Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, with excitement and gratitude, are welcoming the great festival of mankind—the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution—by completing our factory's first Five-Year Plan one hundred days ahead of schedule and completing the 1957 national plan one quarter ahead of schedule.

In the winter of 1953, our factory site was still a piece of farmland. A year and a half later, this modern electronic tube factory, equipped with the world's top technology, stood tall. Such a construction speed would have been unimaginable without Soviet assistance. A year ago, a large number of new workers who had never seen machinery and equipment, and technical personnel lacking practical experience, could now generally operate and work independently. How could this have been possible without the personal guidance of a large number of Soviet experts?

By April of last year, the Soviet government had sent a total of more than 200 experts, headed by Comrade Melkin, the chief engineer of electronic tube manufacturing, to our factory to guide us in equipment installation, machine adjustment, and product trial production. Comrade Kaminsky, the chief representative of the Soviet Union stationed in our factory, also helped our factory formulate a progress plan and measures for civil engineering installation and new product trial production, and assisted our factory in establishing regular production and civilized production order, and establishing various necessary systems for managing modern enterprises. For example, electronic tubes require extreme cleanliness during the manufacturing process, otherwise a large number of defective products will be produced. Our mounting workshop is equipped with double-layer sealed steel windows, and the air must be filtered before it can be sent into the room. Operators must wear clean white overalls, work shoes, and white hats. Mounting workers must also frequently wipe their hands with alcohol to prevent hand sweat from poisoning the cathode of the electronic tube. However, these requirements are often not paid attention to by employees because they have not yet developed the habit of civilized production, which affects the yield of electronic tubes. Expert Kaminsky has repeatedly urged me to carry out publicity and education on vacuum hygiene to all employees, and assisted us in formulating vacuum hygiene work rules, establishing a good habit of paying attention to production hygiene throughout the factory. The installation team led by Soviet mechanical expert Tsibov made outstanding achievements in the equipment installation of our factory. Our factory has more than 16,000 sets of equipment and radio equipment that use various gases, high frequencies, and electronic instruments. These equipments are very precise and require a high degree of accuracy. It is very difficult to safely install and adjust them in a short period of time. In order to save time, experts such as An Tsibov discussed with us the method of "installing, adjusting, test driving, and producing at the same time." Finally, the task was completed more than two months ahead of schedule.

Since our factory is filled with various hazardous gas pipelines inside and outside the factory building, and most of the operators are new workers, the power experts led by Soviet power experts Daglaisky and Kozhevnikov helped us formulate safety operation regulations and established a set of safety operation systems. The experts personally made mobilization reports on safe production to all employees. According to the expert's suggestion, our factory regularly conducts examinations on each operator. Those who pass the examination are issued a "Safety Operation Qualification Certificate", otherwise they are not allowed to operate the machine. Thanks to the implementation of the expert's suggestions, no major equipment and personal accidents have occurred in the past year. At first, the workers in the gas station and hydrogen station did not dare to work the night shift without the experts, fearing an explosion. The experts went to the night shift every day and taught them hand in hand. With the enthusiastic help of the experts, the employees of each gas station were finally able to produce independently. We felt during our internship in the Soviet Union that the smelting and drawing technology of refractory metals was one of the most difficult technologies for our factory to master. But when the expert Sinyukov, who we were familiar with, led a group of experts to the factory, everyone's confidence increased. Sure enough, at the end of last year, under his guidance, we used domestic raw materials to draw tungsten wire, molybdenum wire, and Dumet wire of various specifications, ensuring the needs of fraternal factories across the country.

In order to reduce the cost of fluorescent lamp glass for fraternal factories, we carried out the material replacement and hot repair of the six-ton pool furnace. Expert Naida had tonsillitis and was recovering from surgery, but he ran over as soon as he heard that the workshop was repairing the furnace. At that time, he could barely speak, and everyone persuaded him to go back to rest, but he resolutely refused. Under his guidance, the furnace was repaired safely and on schedule, and good quality glass was produced, reducing the cost by 50%. Comrade Nignov, chief engineer of the Soviet Electric Vacuum Research Institute, Sukharev, deputy chief engineer of the electronic tube factory, and Amontov, process engineer, were experts in small Soviet receiving and amplifying tubes. Under their guidance, our factory strictly followed regular operating procedures and process routes for production, thus avoiding many detours.

Soviet experts respect the opinions of Chinese comrades very much and attach great importance to the combination of Soviet experience and China's actual conditions. In order to save foreign exchange and develop industry, they used our country's equipment and materials as much as possible, and tried our country's materials. Some equipment and materials cannot be manufactured in our country, so they try to provide equipment manufacturing drawings and technical data.

Soviet electronic tube manufacturing technology has been sown and rooted in our factory.

Beijing brand electronic tubes were reviewed by Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country in front of Tiananmen Square during this year's National Day. The products are being used all over the country. Radios assembled with Beijing electronic tubes will also be sold to Southeast Asia. In our harvest, there is the blood and sweat of the Soviet people, which is the crystallization of the friendship between the two peoples. We sincerely thank the Soviet people for their selfless assistance to us.

### 电子管厂和苏联专家

    电子管厂和苏联专家
    北京电子管厂厂长　周凤鸣
    我们北京电子管厂的全体职工，怀着兴奋和感激的心情，以提前一百天完成了我厂第一个五年计划，与提前一个季度完成1957年国家计划来迎接人类伟大的节日——十月革命四十周年。
    1953年冬天，我们的厂址还是一片耕地。一年半后却矗立起了这座以世界上头等技术装备起来的现代化电子管厂。这样的建厂速度，如果没有苏联的援助是很难想像的。一年前到厂的大批从未见过机器设备的新工人，缺乏实际经验的技术人员，现在一般都能进行独立操作和工作了，如果没有大批苏联专家的亲手教导又怎么能办得到呢？
    到去年4月间，苏联政府共选派了以电子管制造总工程师梅尔金同志为首的二百多位专家来厂指导我们进行设备安装，机器调整和产品的试制工作。苏联驻我厂总代表卡明斯基同志还帮助我厂拟定了一个土建安装新产品试制进度与措施计划，又协助我厂建立了正轨生产与文明生产的秩序，树立了必要的管理现代化企业的各种制度。例如：电子管在制造过程中要求异常清洁，否则即会产生大量废品。我们的装架车间安了双层密封玻璃钢窗，空气必须经过过滤后才能送入室内。操作工人必须穿着洁白的工作服，工作鞋，带着白色的帽子，装架工人还必须常用酒精擦手，防止手汗使电子管的阴极中毒。可是这些要求往往由于职工还没有养成文明生产的习惯，不能经常注意，影响到电子管的成品率。卡明斯基专家曾经多次督促我向全体职工进行真空卫生的宣传教育，并且协助我们制定了真空卫生工作规则，在全厂建立了讲生产卫生的好习惯。苏联机械专家齐勃夫所率领的安装队，在我厂设备安装方面的成绩是突出的。我厂共有使用各种气体的、高周波的、电子仪器的设备和无线电设备一万六千多台件。这些设备非常精密，要求准确度很高，要在短期内安全地安装调整好，困难是很大的。为了赢得时间，安齐勃夫等专家同我们研究采用了“边安装、边调整、边试车、边生产”的办法。终于提前了两个多月完成了任务。
    由于我厂厂房内外布满了各种危险性气体管道，而操作者绝大部分是新工人，因此苏联动力专家达格来依斯基与柯热夫尼柯夫同志所率领的动力专家们协助我们制定了安全操作规程，建立了一套安全操作的制度。专家们亲自向全体职工做了关于安全生产的动员报告。根据专家建议我厂定期对每一个操作者进行考试，考试合格的发给“安全操作合格证”，否则不许动机器。由于贯彻了专家建议，一年来还没有发生重大的设备与人身事故。煤气站和氢气站的工人起初离开了专家就不敢值夜班，生怕发生爆炸事故。专家们就天天上夜班，把着手教。在专家的热情帮助下，各气体站的职工终于能够独立生产了。我们在苏联实习时就感到难熔金属的冶炼与拉丝技术是我厂最难掌握的技术中的一种。但是当我们所熟悉的西纽可夫专家带领的一批专家来厂后，大家的信心就增加了。果然在去年年底，在他的指导下，我们就用本国的原料拉制出各种规格的钨丝、钼丝和杜美丝，保证了全国各兄弟厂的需要。
    为了减低各兄弟厂的日光灯玻璃的成本，我们进行了六吨池炉的换料与热修工作。那依达专家因扁桃腺发炎动手术正在休息，但是他一听说车间在修炉就跑来了。那时他说话还很勉强，大家劝他回去休息，但是坚决不肯。在他的指导下，安全、如期的修好了炉并生产出了质量良好的玻璃，降低成本50％。苏联电真空研究院总工艺师尼格诺夫，电子管厂副总工程师苏哈列也夫，工艺师阿蒙托夫等同志是苏联收讯放大小型管的专家，在他们的指导下，我们厂严格地按着正轨的操作规程与工艺路线进行生产，因而少走了许多弯路。
    苏联专家很尊重中国同志的意见，很重视苏联经验和中国实际情况相结合的问题。为了使我们节约外汇和发展工业，他们用最大的可能选用我国设备、器材，试用我国的材料。有些设备和材料我国还造不了，他们就设法提供设备制造的图纸与技术资料。
    苏联的电子管制造技术在我们厂是播下种，扎下了根。
    北京牌的电子管，今年国庆节在天安门前接受了毛主席和全国人民的检阅。产品在全国各地使用着。用北京电子管装配的收音机还将远销东南亚。在我们这些收获里，有苏联人民的血汗，它是两国人民友谊的结晶。我们衷心感谢苏联人民对我们的无私援助。
