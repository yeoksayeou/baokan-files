Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th - Soviet Old Bolsheviks held a banquet at the Moscow Hotel on the evening of the 15th to host old soldiers from various countries who had participated in the October Revolution, the Soviet Civil War, and the Great Patriotic War, and who are currently visiting the Soviet Union.

More than a hundred gray-haired old soldiers from thirteen countries and the Soviet Union gathered together. With pride, they recalled the arduous struggles against the common class enemy in those years, and they celebrated the great victories achieved by the world working class today.

During the banquet, General Alekseyev, a Soviet veteran who participated in the Soviet Civil War, spoke in a very emotional tone. He said that in 1917, workers and soldiers overthrew the capitalist and landlord regime and established Soviet power. Later, foreign interventionists attempted to destroy our young republic. However, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, with the assistance of all of you present and the international working class, we drove away the foreign interventionists, crushed the domestic enemies, and began socialist construction. When the Hitler bandits invaded us, we stood up again as one to fight, and in the struggle, we received fraternal help from the working classes of all countries and achieved great victories. If anyone dares to invade us a third time, we will eliminate them forever.

Ji Shoushan, a member of the Chinese Labor People's Delegation and a participant in the October Revolution, also spoke at the banquet. He said that we Chinese comrades who participated in the October Revolution and the Soviet Civil War are very happy to have the opportunity to come to the Soviet Union again to participate in the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution and to meet with old comrades from various countries. It was the Bolshevik Party that educated and cultivated us, and the Soviet Union is also our homeland. We want to thank the Party and the Soviet Union. Finally, he raised his glass to toast the old revolutionaries of all countries.

Old soldiers from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other countries also spoke at the banquet. They raised their glasses to congratulate the victory of the working class cause and to celebrate the militant friendship of the working classes of all countries. Finally, the old soldiers from various countries sang the Internationale loudly, and they parted reluctantly.

    回忆昔日艰苦  欢庆今日胜利
    老战友聚首莫斯科
    苏联老布尔什维克招待各国老同志
    新华社莫斯科16日电  苏联的老布尔什维克15日晚在莫斯科饭店举行宴会，招待正在苏联参观的曾经参加过十月革命、苏联国内战争和卫国战争的各国老战士。
    来自世界上十三个国家和苏联的百余位白发苍苍的老战士聚会一堂。他们怀着自豪的心情回忆了当年对共同的阶级敌人进行的艰苦斗争，他们欢庆今天世界工人阶级所取得的巨大胜利。
    席间，曾经参加过苏联国内战争的苏联老战士阿列克谢耶夫将军以十分激动的声调讲了话。他说，1917年工人和士兵推翻了资本家地主政权，建立了苏维埃政权。后来外国干涉者企图消灭我们年轻的共和国。但是，在布尔什维克党的领导下，在在座各位和国际工人阶级的援助下，我们赶走了外国干涉者，粉碎了国内敌人，开始了社会主义建设。当希特勒匪帮侵犯我们时，我们又像一个人似地站起来进行斗争，我们在斗争中得到了各国工人阶级兄弟般的帮助，取得了巨大的胜利。如果谁要第三次再来侵犯我们，我们就要永远把他们消灭。
    中国劳动人民代表团团员、十月革命参加者季寿山也在宴会上讲了话。他说，我们参加过十月革命和苏联国内战争的中国同志，今天又能有机会来到苏联参加十月革命四十周年庆祝典礼，并且和各国的老同志见面，真感到非常高兴。教育和培养我们的是布尔什维克党，苏联也是我们的故乡。我们要感谢党和苏联。最后他举杯为各国老革命家干杯。
    在宴会上讲话的还有捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利等国的老战士。他们举杯祝贺工人阶级事业的胜利，祝贺各国工人阶级的战斗友谊。最后，各国的老战士们高唱国际歌，他们依依不舍地分手。
