    The All-Union Society for Dissemination of Scientific Knowledge is Our Model
    Liang Xi, Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization
    Like other socialist undertakings, the Soviet Union's science popularization work has achieved brilliant success under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Since the establishment of the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge in 1947, Soviet scientists and intellectuals have participated more extensively in popularization work.
    As everyone knows, before the October Revolution, Russia, like other countries, used science and culture as tools to help capitalists and landlords exploit workers and peasants. Although some progressive scientists wanted to impart scientific knowledge to the people, it was impossible under the social conditions at the time. The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution opened up broad avenues for the development of science. The October Revolution transformed culture and science, which had served landlords and capitalists, into tools for serving the people and building communism. Lenin said long ago: "Formerly, the entire intelligence of man, the entire genius of mankind, was active solely to give all the benefits of technology and culture to a section of the people, and to deprive another section of the bare necessities--education and development. Now all the marvels of technology and all the achievements of culture will become the possession of the whole people, and from now on man's brain and genius will never be used for oppression and exploitation. We know this, and is it not worth striving for, is it not worth devoting all our strength to this great historical task?"
    After the October Socialist Revolution, Soviet intellectuals followed Lenin's teachings and closely linked science popularization with the practice of communist construction. In the declaration initiating the establishment of the Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge on May 1, 1947, prominent Soviet scientists such as Vavilov, Balakin, Mitin, and Yudin explicitly pointed out: "In order to effectively realize the great task of building a communist society, it is necessary to carry out systematic and extensive work to raise the cultural level of the working people, strengthen the communist education of the Soviet people, and unremittingly struggle to eliminate the vestiges of capitalism in the people's ideology."
    This association regards tirelessly carrying out the popularization of political and scientific knowledge for the broad masses of working people as its sacred duty. Over the past ten years, members have gone deep into factories, collective farms, schools, troops, and government organs to give lectures, with many members giving three or four lectures a month. Many members voluntarily participate in writing scientific manuscripts, reviewing manuscripts, and preparing lecture aids. Many prominent Soviet scientists have participated in the work of the Presidium of the Council and academic groups of the association, creatively completing their tasks. Many members—prominent Soviet scientists and innovators on the industrial and agricultural production fronts—were sent by the association from Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev to various industrial and agricultural centers, communist construction sites, and remote newly reclaimed areas to give lectures. The All-Union Association regularly organizes various political and scientific knowledge publicity activities in accordance with the policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. For example, after the CPSU Central Committee passed the resolution on "Measures for the Further Development of Soviet Agriculture" at its September 1953 plenary session, the association immediately convened a plenary meeting of the council and formulated specific measures to improve agricultural publicity in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the CPSU Central Committee. Subsequently, the association convened a study session for the heads of agricultural academic groups and sent many people to the provincial branches to help them organize agricultural study sessions, thereby effectively improving agricultural publicity. The number of agricultural lectures reached more than 138,000 in the nine months after the September plenary session.
    The experience of the All-Union Association tells us that the first issues that should be resolved in science popularization work are who science popularization work serves and how to carry out work under the leadership of the Party. The path taken by the All-Union Association is the path of communism, and I think our association should do the same. However, some people are still confused on this issue, and bourgeois rightists openly oppose science popularization work taking the socialist road. They vainly attempt to drag the association onto the capitalist road. They oppose science popularization work serving production, saying, "Science popularization work is cultural life, it is something that enriches people's cultural life and expands the field of knowledge. The proposition that science popularization work should be closely integrated with production seems too high." The essence of this view is to oppose science popularization work serving socialist construction.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has pointed out more than once that scientific propaganda must serve socialist construction and communist construction. Taking the publicity work in 9 months of 1954 as an example, the popularization of natural science, technology, agriculture, and advanced experiences in industrial transportation accounted for 68.2% of the entire publicity. Not only that, the All-Union Association disseminated the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism in the publicity of political knowledge, and waged a resolute struggle against the remnants of bourgeois ideology in the publicity. In the publicity of natural sciences, they correctly applied the viewpoint of dialectical materialism to explain natural phenomena, and vigorously promoted Pavlov's theory and Michurin's theory, and publicized the dialectical materialist world view.
    Our country's science popularization work has made great progress, which is inseparable from the selfless assistance given to us by the All-Union Association. Shortly after our association was established, it organized a delegation to the Soviet Union to study at the invitation of the All-Union Association. After returning to China, it promoted advanced experiences such as organizing academic groups according to disciplines to ensure the quality of publicity and give play to the enthusiasm of members, which greatly promoted the development of the work of the All-Union Association. Due to learning from their experience in popularizing astronomical knowledge, we have established the first Beijing Planetarium. In order to help young Chinese workers learn advanced scientific and technological knowledge, the Soviet Union helped us edit and publish the magazine "Knowledge is Power." The All-Union Association also frequently sends us various scientific and technological booklets and magazines, as many as twenty kinds in the past two months alone.
    Our country is in a period of building socialism. In this period, the contradiction between capitalism and socialism is still quite sharp, and there is also a serious struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism within our association. This struggle will continue to exist for a long time in the future. Our primary task is to win the battle on this front, thoroughly smash the bourgeois rightists' rampant attacks on the Party and socialism, and stop the activities of careerists in the association and their utilization of the association. The historical experience of the All-Union Association proves this to us. The broad masses of members of the All-Union Association are able to engage in association work in accordance with the Party's guidelines and policies and based on the principles of building communism precisely because they have armed themselves into Marxist-Leninist fighters. As the famous Soviet scientist Vavilov said, the broad masses of members of the All-Union Association regard science popularization work as communist voluntary labor. Therefore, in their various work positions, they consciously assist the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state in actively carrying out the communist education movement, bringing the immortal doctrines of Marxism-Leninism and the latest achievements of modern science and technology to the people.
    The Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China called on our country's 600 million people to build our country into a modernized industrial country and a modernized agricultural country during the Third Five-Year Plan. The Third Plenary Session discussed and adopted the Outline for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) and has been published to the whole nation. This has brought new glorious and arduous tasks to our association. I suggest that the plenary session should redouble its efforts in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session and impart the scientific knowledge that the people need most to the people at present. We must also, like the All-Union Association, closely link science popularization work with the practice of socialist construction in our country. This is a point that we must earnestly learn from the Soviet Union when the people of the whole country celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

    全苏科普协会是我们的榜样
    中华全国科学技术普及协会主席　梁希
    苏联的科学普及事业也和其他社会主义事业一样，在苏联共产党的领导之下获得了辉煌的成就，1947年，全苏政治与科学知识普及协会成立以后，苏联的科学家和知识分子就更广泛的参加了普及工作。
    大家知道十月革命以前，俄国和其他国家一样，科学和文化成了帮助资本家、地主对工人农民进行剥削的工具。尽管有些进步的科学家想把科学知识交给人民，但是在当时的社会条件下是不可能的。伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，才给科学事业的发展开辟了广阔的道路。十月革命把为地主、资本家服务的文化和科学，变为为人民服务，为共产主义建设服务的工具。列宁早就说过：“从前全部人类的智慧，全部人类的天才之进行活动，仅仅是为了给予一部分人以技术和文化底全部福利，而剥夺另一部分人的最必需的东西——教育和发展。现在技术的一切奇迹，文化的一切成就都成为全民所有了，从今以后，人类的智慧和天才永远不再会变为暴力的工具和剥削的工具了。我们懂得了这一点，那么，难道为了这个最伟大的历史任务，不值得努力，不值得献出全部力量吗？”
    十月社会主义革命以后，苏联的知识分子早就按照列宁的教导，把科学普及工作和共产主义建设的实践紧密地联系起来了。在1947年5月1日，苏联著名科学家瓦维洛夫、巴拉金、米丁、尤金等人，在发起成立政治与科学知识普及协会的宣言中已经明确地指出：“为有效地实现建设共产主义社会的伟大任务，要求进行系统而广泛的工作以提高劳动人民的文化，加强苏联人民的共产主义教育工作，并不懈地为肃清人民思想意识中资本主义的遗毒而斗争。”
    这个协会面向广大劳动人民把不倦地进行政治与科学知识的普及工作，当作自己的神圣职责。十年来，会员深入到工厂、集体农庄、学校、部队、机关中去讲演，很多会员每月讲演三、四次之多。许多会员都自愿地参加编写科学讲稿、审查讲稿、准备讲演辅助材料等工作。许多苏联著名的科学家们都参加了协会理事会主席团和学组的工作，创造性的完成了自己的任务。有不少的会员——著名的苏联科学家、工农业生产战线上的革新者，由协会从莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅派到各工农业中心地区、共产主义建设的工地和偏远的新开垦地区去作讲演。全苏协会经常根据苏联共产党和苏联政府的政策来组织各种政治与科学知识的宣传。如苏共中央在1953年9月全会通过了“关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施”的决议。协会就立即召开了理事会全体会议，按照苏共中央的指示精神，拟定了改进农业宣传的具体措施。接着协会又召开了农业学组负责人的讲习会，并且还派许多人深入到各省分会，帮助他们组织农业讲习会，因此有效地改进了农业宣传。农业讲演次数在9月全会后的九个月内就达到了十三万八千余次。
    全苏协会的经验告诉我们，在科普工作上首先应该解决的问题，就是科普工作为谁而服务，和怎样在党的领导下进行工作的问题。全苏协会所走的道路，是共产主义的道路，我想，我们的协会也应当如此。但是在这个问题上，有些人还很糊涂，资产阶级右派分子公然反对科普工作走社会主义道路。他们，妄想把协会拉到资本主义道路上去，他们反对科普工作为生产服务，说什么，
  “科普工作是文化生活，它是丰富人民的文化生活，扩大知识领域的东西，科普工作应当紧密结合生产的提法似乎太高了。”这种主张的本质就是反对科普工作为社会主义建设服务。
    苏联共产党中央就不只一次地指出过，科学宣传必须为社会主义建设和共产主义建设服务。仅以1954年的9个月的宣传工作为例，普及的自然科学、技术科学、农业以及工业运输业的先进经验等宣传在整个宣传中占68．2％。不仅如此，全苏协会在政治知识的宣传方面传播了马克思列宁主义的学说，在宣传中和资产阶级思想残余进行了坚决地斗争。在自然科学宣传方面，他们正确地应用辩证唯物主义的观点来解释自然现象，大力宣传巴甫洛夫学说和米丘林的学说。宣传了辩证唯物主义世界观。
    我国的科学普及工作已经有了很大的发展，这是与全苏协会给予我们的无私援助分不开的。我们协会诞生不久，就应全苏协会的邀请，组织了协会访苏代表团赴苏学习。回国后，推广了按学科组织学组来保证宣传质量和发挥会员积极性等先进经验，大大促进了全会工作的开展。由于学习了他们普及天文知识的经验，我们已经建立了第一座北京天文馆。苏联为帮助我国青年工人学习先进的科学技术知识，帮助我们编辑出版了“知识就是力量”杂志。全苏协会还经常寄给我们各种科学技术小册子和杂志，仅在最近两个月内寄来的就有二十种之多。
    我国正处在建设社会主义的时期。在这个时期，资本主义同社会主义的矛盾仍然是相当尖锐的，我们协会内部也同样存在着资本主义和社会主义这两条道路的严重斗争。这个斗争在今后还会长期的存在下去。我们的首要任务就是要在这一条战线上打胜仗，彻底粉碎资产阶级右派分子向党向社会主义的猖狂进攻，制止野心分子在协会中的活动和他们对协会的利用。全苏协会的历史经验给我们证明了这一点。全苏协会的广大会员们，所以能够按照党的方针政策，根据建设共产主义的原则从事协会工作，正是因为他们已经把自己武装成了马克思列宁主义的战士。正像苏联著名科学家瓦维洛夫所说的那样，全苏协会的广大会员，把科普工作看成是共产主义的义务劳动。因此他们在各个不同的工作岗位上，自觉地协助布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家积极地开展共产主义的教育运动，把马克思列宁主义的不朽学说和现代科学与技术的最新成就带给人民。
    中国共产党八届三中全会号召我国六万万人民，在第三个五年计划期间内，把我国建设成为现代化的工业国和现代化农业国。三中全会讨论通过了农业发展纲要（修正草案）并且已向全民公布了。这就给我们协会带来了新的光荣而艰巨的任务。我建议，全会应当按照三中全会的精神加倍的努力奋斗，把当前人民最需要的科学知识交给人民。我们也要像全苏协会那样，把科学普及工作同我国的社会主义建设实践紧密地联系起来。这是我们当全国人民欢庆伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，必须向苏联认真学习的一点。
