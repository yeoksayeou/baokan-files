    Eager to Know About the Situation of Downward Transferred Cadres
    Currently, many staff members of organizations and schools have begun to participate in physical labor in a planned way, and many cadres have been transferred downward to the countryside to participate in production at the grassroots level.
    Although the time is not long for the comrades who went down first, it is believable that they have begun to learn labor and have preliminary feelings. At the same time, they may also encounter some difficulties and problems in actual labor. How to solve them are all issues that everyone cares about. I hope to organize some reports in this regard to educate those who have not yet participated in physical labor. Moreover, it can also enable those who have already participated in labor to get inspiration from each other.

    很想知道下放干部的情况
    现在，许多机关、学校的人员开始了有计划地参加体力劳动，有不少干部已下放到农村到基层去参加生产。
    最先下去的同志，虽然时间不长，但是可以相信他们已经开始学会了劳动，并且有了初步的感受，同时，他们在实际劳动中，也可能遇到一些困难和问题，怎样解决的，这些，都是大家所关心的。希望组织一些这方面的报道，以教育还未参加体力劳动的人。而且，也可以使已经参加劳动的人互相得到启发。
