	Has a Program, Has an Organization, Has Discipline
	Wang Zimei Organizes Reactionary Group

	(Our Dispatch) Through repeated exposure in Chongqing's art circles, a counter-revolutionary group headed by Wang Zimei – the "Xin Society" – has been fully exposed.

	Wang Zimei, disguised as a "progressive cartoonist," formed this anti-Communist painting society in March of this year under the guise of "academic research." Its members were mostly people with strong ambition for fame and position and personal ambition, and some were even historical counter-revolutionaries. Wang Zimei openly put forward the reactionary slogan of "uniting the backward, winning over the middle, and attacking the progressive."

	According to revelations, the "Xin Society" was tightly organized, with a "core organization" and an "outer organization." Key members had a division of labor, separately contacting a group of peripheral members. The society had strict discipline, such as stipulating that articles published or speeches made by "Xin Society" members must be unanimously approved by all members; in public, members were not allowed to argue with each other; when published articles and speeches were criticized, all members of the "Xin Society" would unanimously conduct counter-criticism, and so on.

	During the period of Great Blooming and Great Contending in Chongqing's art circles, Wang Zimei thought the time had come and attacked the Party's responsible cadres of the Chongqing branch of the Artists Association as "feudal bosses." The Party's activists were labeled as "thugs," and demanded a change in the system of the Chongqing branch of the Artists Association. He also secretly drafted a reactionary plan for "artists governing the association," intending to seize the Party's leadership at the members' representative conference in the third quarter of this year through "free elections" based on painting categories. Subsequently, their conspiracy failed because the anti-Rightist struggle had already begun. (Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch)

### 有纲领　有组织　有纪律  汪子美组织反动集团

    有纲领　有组织　有纪律
    汪子美组织反动集团
    本报讯　经过重庆美术界多次会议的揭发，以汪子美为首的一个反共集团——“辛社”已全部暴露。
    披着“进步漫画家”外衣的汪子美，在今年3月份以“学术研究”为名，组成了这个反动画社，其中的成员大都是有浓厚名位思想和怀有个人野心的人，有的还是历史上的反革命分子。汪子美公然提出“团结落后，争取中间，打击进步”的反动口号；
    据揭露，“辛社”组织严密，有“核心组织”、“外围组织”。骨干分子间又有分工，分别联络一批外围分子。社内定有严格的纪律，如规定“辛社”成员对外发表文章或在会议上发言，必须经全体社员一致通过；在公开场合，成员间不许互相争论；发表的文章和言论受到批评时，“辛社”全体成员就要一致进行反批评等。
    重庆美术界大鸣大放时期，汪子美以为时机已到，攻击美协重庆分会党的负责干部是“封建把头”。党的积极分子是“打手”，要求改变美协重庆分会的体制，并秘密拟订“画家治会”的反动方案，要在今年三季度会员代表大会上，以画种为单位搞“自由竞选”夺取党的领导。随后因为反右派斗争已经展开，他们的阴谋才未得逞。　（新华社专稿）
