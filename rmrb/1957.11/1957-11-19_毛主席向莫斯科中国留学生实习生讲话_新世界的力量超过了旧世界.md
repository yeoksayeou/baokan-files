Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 18th: Chairman Mao Zedong met with Chinese students from various schools and Chinese interns from various units in the assembly hall of Moscow University on Lenin Hills on the afternoon of the 17th, and delivered a speech to them.

At 6:00 PM on this Sunday afternoon, Chairman Mao Zedong and members of the Chinese delegation, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Dehuai, Ulanhu, Chen Boda, Yang Shangkun, Hu Qiaomu and others, accompanied by Ambassador Liu Xiao, entered the venue, nearly three thousand Chinese students and interns erupted in thunderous applause and cheers.

Chairman Mao walked to the front of the stage and waved to the students, the entire auditorium erupted, applause and cheers merged into one, lasting for ten minutes.

When Chairman Mao addressed everyone, he spoke about the current international situation. He said that the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of sixty-eight countries participated in the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This is an event of great significance. It demonstrates the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and the unity of the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of the world . The socialist camp must have a head, and that head is the Soviet Union. The Communist Party and Workers' Parties of all countries must also have a head, and that head is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The solidarity of the international communist movement, and the launching of two artificial satellites by the Soviet Union, these two events mark a new turning point in the balance of power between the two major camps. The October Revolution produced a new world. After forty years, the power of the new world has surpassed the old world. Now the world has a population of 2.7 billion. The population of socialist countries is nearly 1 billion, the population of independent former colonial countries is more than 700 million, and the population of countries striving for independence or complete independence is 600 million. The population of the imperialist camp is only about 400 million, and they are internally divided. Now it is not the West wind prevailing over the East wind, but the East wind prevailing over the West wind.

In his speech, Chairman Mao encouraged the students with three things: study hard, be humble and cautious, and unite closely with Soviet students.

Chairman Mao spoke to the students for about forty minutes.

When Chairman Mao spoke, the whole audience applauded and cheered continuously.

After the speech, Chairman Mao and members of the delegation visited the student dormitories together. In the corridor leading from the auditorium to the student dormitory, Soviet students and other foreign students who stayed in the dormitory on their day off shook hands with Chairman Mao Zedong, greeted him, and applauded to pay their respects. Chairman Mao also returned their greetings. Chairman Mao talked with Soviet students while visiting the student dormitory.

    毛主席向莫斯科中国留学生实习生讲话
    新世界的力量超过了旧世界
    国际共产主义运动的团结和两颗人造卫星上了天，标志了两大阵营力量对比的转折点。社会主义阵营必须有一个头，这个头就是苏联。各国共产党和工人党也必须有一个头，这个头就是苏联共产党。
    新华社莫斯科18日电　毛泽东主席17日下午在列宁山上莫斯科大学大礼堂同莫斯科各学校中国留学生和各单位中国实习生见了面，并且向他们讲了话。
    在这个星期天的下午六时，毛泽东主席和中国代表团团员邓小平、彭德怀、乌兰夫、陈伯达、杨尚昆、胡乔木等同志在刘晓大使陪同下进入会场时，全场的将近三千名中国留学生和实习生发出了春雷般的掌声和欢呼声。
    毛主席走向台前向同学们挥手致意，整个大礼堂沸腾起来，掌声和欢呼声连成一片，达十分钟之久。
    毛主席向大家讲话的时候，谈到了当前的国际形势。他说，六十八个国家的共产党和工人党参加了伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的庆祝，这是一个有伟大意义的事件，它表现了社会主义国家以苏联为首的团结一致，表现了全世界共产党和工人党的团结一致。社会主义阵营必须有一个头，这个头就是苏联。各国共产党和工人党也必须有一个头，这个头就是苏联共产党。国际共产主义运动的团结，和苏联的两颗人造卫星上了天，这两件事标志了两大阵营力量对比的新的转折点。十月革命产生了新世界，经过四十年，新世界的力量已经超过了旧世界。现在全世界有二十七亿人口，社会主义各国的人口将近十亿，独立了的旧殖民地国家的人口有七亿多，正在争取独立或者争取完全独立的国家的人口有六亿，帝国主义阵营的人口不过四亿左右，而且他们的内部是分裂的。现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。
    毛主席在讲话中勉励同学们三件事，这就是努力学习，谦虚谨慎，同苏联同学亲密团结。
    毛主席和同学们讲话约四十分钟。
    当毛主席讲话的时候，全场不断鼓掌、欢呼。
    讲话以后，毛主席和代表团团员们一同到学生宿舍去参观。在从大礼堂通往学生宿舍的通道上，在休息日留在宿舍里的苏联学生和其他外国留学生纷纷向毛泽东主席握手问好，鼓掌致敬。毛泽东主席也向他们答礼问好。毛主席在参观学生宿舍的时候，同苏联学生谈了话。
    下午八时，毛主席和代表团团员们向同学们告别。学生们一直把毛泽东主席送出大门口，他们向毛主席高喊“再见”。
    新华社莫斯科18日电　中国共产党中央政治局候补委员、中央宣传部长陆定一，11月17日在列宁山上莫斯科大学大礼堂向莫斯科的全体中国留学生、实习生作了关于国内情况和整风问题的报告。（附图片）
