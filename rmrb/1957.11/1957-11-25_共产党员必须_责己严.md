Xinhua News Agency report: Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all factories that, in addition to continuing to conscientiously improve shortcomings in production management, welfare, Party-masses work, etc., they must first focus the main thrust of rectification on the ideological style of leading cadres. Many factory-level Party leading cadres, following the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, have successively made public self-criticisms. This action deeply moved the broad masses of workers. The relationship between leaders and the led has become unprecedentedly close. The workers said: "The Communist Party is truly strict with itself!" Their enthusiasm for helping the leadership carry out rectification is even higher, and they have actively put forward rationalization proposals for rectification, and have even begun to solve problems themselves.

Some time ago, factories and enterprises in Tianjin also took such steps and achieved the same results.

This is a very important experience. It shows that only when Communist Party members and leading cadres are "strict with themselves" will the masses have sufficient confidence, speak frankly, and work can only gain mass support and be thoroughly reformed. If the rectification movement is not very vigorous in some places, we suggest that the leading cadres there check whether they have neglected such an important step.

    共产党员必须“责己严”
    据新华社报道：最近中共上海市委指示各厂，除了要继续认真改进生产管理、生活福利、党群工作等方面的缺点以外，必须首先把整改的主要锋芒对准领导干部的思想作风。许多厂一级党员领导干部，根据市委的指示，纷纷当众检讨。这一行动，深深地感动了广大职工群众。领导与被领导之间的关系空前密切起来。工人们说：“共产党真是责己严！”他们帮助领导进行整改的积极性更高了，纷纷提出整改的合理化建议，并且自己动起手来解决问题。
    前些时天津市的工厂企业也采取了这样的步骤，也取得了同样的效果。
    这是一个十分重要的经验。它说明：只有共产党员、领导干部“责己严”，群众才会信心足，鸣得透，工作也才能取得群众支持，改得彻底。如果有什么地方整风运动不大景气，我们建议那里的领导干部检查一下，是不是忽略了这样一个重要步骤。
