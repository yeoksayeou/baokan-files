Beijing Railway Institute's teachers and students, with high labor enthusiasm, have turned more than forty acres of scattered wasteland on campus into a farm, affectionately known as "Hongguoyuan Farm".

On the first day of labor, more than 3,000 teachers, students, and staff participated. The air was filled with labor songs. Although there was a shortage of tools, the faculty, staff, and students of the entire institute overcame this difficulty, clearing bricks and stones from the ground by hand. Many students also created substitute tools. Many places were former construction sites, and the soil was unsuitable for cultivation, but everyone was determined to completely transform it into fertile fields through their labor. Teachers and staff members who applied for "sending down" considered this a valuable opportunity to prepare for labor training before "sending down", and no one was willing to show weakness when wielding a pickaxe to break the ground. The president, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, and twenty-six comrades who participated in the first batch of rectification also labored alongside everyone. Before the farm officially started, they broke the first ground for the farm, digging out 520 square meters of wasteland in two and a half hours. On the eve of the farm's opening, students proposed to learn from the glorious example of Soviet youth reclaiming virgin land and responded to the Party Central Committee's call to participate in physical labor.

The farm's opening is another sign of the masses' increased socialist consciousness. Under the leadership and education of the Party, and after the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification and release, the labor enthusiasm of the teachers, students, and staff of the entire institute has been continuously rising since the beginning of this semester. After the voluntary labor improvement group led by the Party committee put forward a voluntary labor improvement plan in early September, a cleaning duty system was implemented in student dormitory passages, classrooms, teaching and research offices, and offices. At the same time, the institute organized all teachers, students, and staff to participate in cotton picking labor at the Dazhongsi Agricultural Production Cooperative and various physical labor activities during holidays.

    北京铁道学院师生劳动热情高
    把校内荒地开辟成“红果园农场”
    本报讯　北京铁道学院集中了分散在校园各处的四十余亩大块荒地组成了一个农场，人们亲切的称它为“红果园农场”。
    在开始劳动的第一天有三千多师生员工参加了劳动。到处是劳动的歌声，虽然劳动工具不足，但是全院师生员工克服了这个困难，用手清理地面上的砖头、石子，许多同学还创造了代用工具。好多地方过去是建筑工地，土质不适合耕种，但每个人都决心要用自己的劳动彻底把它变为肥田。申请下放的教师、职员同志都认为这是下放前很珍贵的劳动锻炼的准备机会，抡镐刨地谁也不肯示弱。院长、党委副书记等参加第一批整风的二十六位同志也和大家一起劳动着，早在农场正式开工以前他们就为农场开了第一锹，两个半小时共刨出荒地五百二十平方公尺。在农场开工的前夕，同学纷纷提出学习苏联青年开垦生荒地的光辉榜样，响应党中央关于参加体力劳动的号召。
    农场的开工是群众社会主义觉悟提高的又一标志。在党的领导和教育下，全院师生员工经过反右派斗争和整改鸣放，这学期开学以来劳动热情不断的高涨。9月初党委领导的义务劳动改进小组提出了义务劳动改进方案以后，在学生宿舍甬道和教室、教研室和办公室实行清扫值日制度，同时利用假日分别组织了全院师生员工参加大钟寺农业生产合作社的摘棉花劳动和各种体力劳动。
