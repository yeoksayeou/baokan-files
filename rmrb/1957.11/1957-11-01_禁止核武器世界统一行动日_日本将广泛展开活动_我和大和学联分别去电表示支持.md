Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 31st - The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs announced at a press conference on the 30th that forty-six prefectures and more than one hundred cities across Japan have decided to hold mass rallies and demonstrations on November 1st, the World Unified Action Day Demanding the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The number of people participating in the unified action day activities will exceed 800,000.

According to the council's spokesperson, the scale of this nationwide gathering and demonstration to be held in Japan will be second only to the "May Day" Labor Day celebrations. On November 1st, a central rally for the World Unified Action Day Against Nuclear Weapons with 30,000 participants will be held at Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall in Tokyo. Major cities such as Kyoto, Osaka, and Fukuoka will also hold rallies with more than 10,000 participants each. 450,000 Japanese university and high school students belonging to the "All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations" have decided to participate in the unified action day through various means such as strikes, student conferences, and participation in mass rallies. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has also decided to call on workers across Japan to hold rallies on that day.

The signature campaign that started successively in various parts of Japan from October 20th has collected 100,000 signatures as of today, and the number of signatures is still increasing. The purpose of launching this signature campaign is to urge the Japanese government to submit a proposal to the United Nations demanding the immediate and unconditional conclusion of an agreement prohibiting nuclear weapons testing, to demand that the Japanese government conclude an agreement with the United States not to bring nuclear weapons into Japanese territory, and to demand that the Japanese government and the Diet revise the Atomic Bomb Victims Medical Law into a victim and family support law.

The congratulatory telegram said: We Chinese people have always been loyal to the cause of peace and advocate the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and support the efforts made by the Japanese people in this regard.

    禁止核武器世界统一行动日
    日本将广泛展开活动
    我和大和学联分别去电表示支持
    据新华社31日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会30日在记者招待会上宣布，日本全国四十六个都、道、府、县和一百多个城市，决定在11月1日的要求禁止核武器世界统一行动日举行群众大会和示威游行。参加统一行动日的活动的人数将超过八十万人。
    据协议会发言人宣布，将在日本举行的这次全国性集会和示威游行的规模将仅次于“五一”劳动节的庆祝大会。11月1日，将在东京日比谷野外音乐堂举行有三万人参加的禁止核武器世界统一行动日中央大会，京都、大阪、福冈等大城市也将分别举行有一万多群众参加的大会。属于“全日本学生自治会总联合会”的日本大学生和高中学生四十五万人，决定以罢课、开学生大会、参加群众大会等各种方式来参加统一行动日。工会总评议会也决定号召日本全国工人在当天举行集会。
    从10月20日起在日本全国各地陆续开始的签名运动，截至今天为止已经征集了十万人的签名，签名的人数还在继续增加。发动这个签名运动的目的在于促使日本政府向联合国提出要求立即无条件缔结禁止试验核武器协定的提案，要求日本政府同美国缔结不把核武器运进日本境内的协定，并且要求日本政府同国会把原子弹受害者医疗法修改为受害者和家族援护法。
    据新华社31日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会10月31日打电报给日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会，祝贺将在1日举行的禁止核武器世界统一行动日。
    贺电说：我们中国人民一贯忠于和平事业和主张禁止核武器，支持日本人民在这方面所作的努力。
    据新华社31日讯　中华全国学生联合会在“要求禁止核武器世界统一行动日”（11月1日）前几天，写信给全日本学生自治会总联合会并转日本学生们，代表全中国学生向为反对原子弹和氢弹而英勇斗争的日本学生致敬。
