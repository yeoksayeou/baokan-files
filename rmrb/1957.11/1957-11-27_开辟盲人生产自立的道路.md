    Paving the Way for the Blind to Achieve Self-Reliance Through Production
    Under the care of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the cause of the blind in New China is growing. This year, the number of blind people participating in productive labor has increased significantly, and a series of moving new events have emerged. For example, the "National Youth Blind People's Quadrennial Track and Field Competition" was held in Shanghai; the production achievements of blind people from various regions were exhibited in Beijing; in June, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the China Blind Welfare Association convened a "Symposium on the Production Work of the Blind" with representatives from fifteen provinces and cities, exchanging experiences in supporting and organizing blind people to participate in productive labor, which will promote the further development of the blind people's production. The blind masses in our country have deeply realized that the superior socialist system brings them infinitely beautiful and happy prospects.
    The old society deprived the blind of all possibilities to develop their talents, and the blind were regarded as "waste," suffering discrimination and abuse. In the new society, the blind have obtained the same equal rights as able-bodied people. With the development of socialist economic construction and the increasing achievements of the blind people's production, the blind people in our country will gradually become people who are disabled but not useless, self-reliant and self-supporting.
    Since liberation, the Party and the government have given care and attention to the blind masses in all aspects. The first is to ensure their livelihood. A large proportion of the blind people have very difficult lives, and the government has provided them with necessary relief in a timely manner so that they are no longer threatened by hunger and cold; the homeless and helpless blind people are taken into the elderly, disabled and orphans' homes in various places, and the state provides them with living expenses, so that these people are free from wandering, and have support for birth, aging, illness, and death. According to incomplete statistics, more than 10,000 blind people have been taken in and supported in various places. Secondly, some work has been done in supporting the blind to engage in production, developing education for the blind, and preventing and treating blindness. For example, according to incomplete statistics in Heilongjiang Province, more than 10,000 blind people have regained their sight through treatment in the past eight years. However, the current work for the blind in our country is still quite backward. Some things that could be done under the current conditions have not been done or have not been done well enough. For example, enabling the majority of rural young and middle-aged blind people to participate in auxiliary labor or sideline production in agricultural production cooperatives; organizing more urban blind people to engage in production and self-help; concentrating on educating and training revolutionary disabled soldiers who have lost their sight, training them to become the backbone of the work for the blind; appropriately expanding the existing schools for the blind, enriching teachers and equipment, and building new schools for the blind in provinces and large cities without schools for the blind, etc., are not impossible to achieve.
    The reason for the backwardness of the work for the blind is mainly because the view of underestimating the blind left over from the old society still widely exists, some cadres in relevant departments do not pay enough attention to this work, and do not understand the ability and wisdom of the blind, and do not know how to arrange the work for the blind. Some cadres also have a purely relief and gift-giving attitude, do not pay attention to the work of supporting the blind to participate in productive labor, and lack understanding of the fundamental requirements and long-term interests of the blind, which cannot give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the blind masses. Some cadres believe that the employment problem of the blind can only be solved after the employment problem of able-bodied people is solved, and do not study and consider the problem of the blind in accordance with the spirit of overall planning and turning negative factors into positive factors, so that the work for the blind cannot be properly arranged. These ideas hinder the development of the work for the blind. We believe that in order to better develop the production of the blind and carry out the work for the blind, we must break the general people's, especially the cadres of state organs', view of underestimating the blind; we must use the achievements made by the blind in our country on various labor fronts and the advanced examples of the work of the blind in the Soviet Union and other countries to carry out extensive publicity to the society in order to establish a new social morality and custom—regarding the assistance to people with physical defects as an obligation and noble character that everyone should fulfill.
    The main task and central link of the work for the blind is to gradually support and organize the blind to achieve self-reliance through production along with the development of national economic construction. Except for a small number of blind people who can be trained to engage in other occupations, during the transition period, efforts should be made to gradually enable blind people with labor capacity to get rid of economic dependence and political and cultural backwardness by participating in various kinds of productive labor, and to participate in various social activities like able-bodied people, and become active builders of the socialist motherland.
    The Soviet Union's blind people have victoriously walked this road. Today, each of their republics has established its own association for the blind, and under the leadership of the association, there are many blind people's production and teaching factories. These factories are equipped with modern machines specially designed for the blind, and the blind can produce precision parts. The production profit of the blind people's factories, in addition to being turned over to the state treasury, is used by the blind people's association to develop the production of the blind and to carry out various welfare undertakings. The achievements made in the work of the blind in the Soviet Union have set a brilliant example for our country.
    More than 80% of the blind people in our country are distributed in the vast rural areas. In the past, the scattered small-scale peasant economy could not give play to the labor potential of the blind. Today, under the conditions that the rural areas have been cooperativized, it is possible for the rural young and middle-aged blind people to obtain work suitable for the blind in agricultural production cooperatives. According to preliminary investigations, the blind can engage in mowing grass, drawing water, accumulating fertilizer, threshing, shaking windmills, raising livestock and poultry, weaving mats, weaving baskets, making straw ropes and other auxiliary labor. Those who do well can be equivalent to an ordinary full laborer, and those who do poorly can be equivalent to a half laborer. At present, it is not common for rural blind people to participate in productive labor, and the Party organizations at the county and district levels in various places should pay attention to this work. Of course, when rural blind people first participate in productive labor, their skills are not skilled and they may feel that their physical strength is not enough, but these difficulties can be overcome after a period of training.
    As for supporting the urban blind to engage in production, the principle of "adapting to local conditions" should be adopted. In general areas, handicraft industry should be the main focus, and in some industrialized cities with conditions, semi-mechanized or mechanized production can be established. In terms of absorbing objects, blind people with difficult lives should generally be absorbed first. Organizational forms can participate in existing poor people's production units, so that the blind form a group, a workshop, and take on work procedures that are suitable for the characteristics of the blind. In cities with conditions, factories or production cooperatives mainly composed of blind people (blind people account for 60%-70%) should also be established. Because the blind have common physiological defects and common requirements, it is easier to manage and take care of them when they are concentrated in production. The principle of "classified support" should be earnestly implemented for the blind people concentrated in the elderly, disabled and orphans' homes in various places. For the young and middle-aged blind people among them, attention should be paid to training them to learn production skills, helping them to be self-sufficient, and when conditions are ripe, they can be transferred to independent blind people's factories or production cooperatives. The way for the development of the production of the blind should gradually move from simple handicraft industry to semi-mechanization and finally to mechanization, from small to large, from subordinate to independent, from decentralized to centralized, and must be adapted to the development of the entire national economy of our country.
    Guaranteeing the supply of raw materials and the sales of products is an important condition for the development of the production of the blind. Because there are not many ways for the blind to produce at present, the production efficiency of the blind is low, and there are many difficulties in production and operation, handicraft industry, supply and marketing, commerce and other departments in various places need to give support and care in terms of supply, production and sales. Some products produced by the blind, such as iron nails and cotton fabrics, should be included in the local production plan to ensure the supply of raw materials. The local civil affairs departments and the blind welfare sub-associations must strive for the support of relevant departments in this work; at the same time, it is also necessary to actively strive for the assistance of the masses of the society to the cause of the blind. For example, the blind people's production funds can also be subsidized from enthusiastic people in the society—whether collective or individual.
    At present, blind welfare sub-associations have been established in seven provinces and cities, including Beijing, and the blind people's production and other blind people's welfare work in these places have been further developed. In the future, the blind welfare sub-associations should take supporting and organizing the blind to participate in productive labor as the main task. In places where the sub-associations have been established and the work is ready, they should directly manage the local blind people's production organizations, help them consolidate and develop, and also give appropriate care to the blind people participating in the poor people's production units. Blind welfare sub-associations can be established in cities with a large number of blind people, where the blind masses urgently demand production and self-reliance, or where there are blind people's production organizations. The civil affairs departments in various places should regard the blind welfare sub-associations as a powerful assistant in carrying out the work for the blind, and pay attention to training and absorbing representative figures of the blind to participate in the leadership and daily work of the sub-associations, and equip full-time non-blind cadres to assist. Only in this way can a group of backbone workers for the blind be trained, the characteristics of the blind and the production of the blind can be understood, and the special needs and interests of the blind can be guaranteed. Some local civil affairs departments worry that after the establishment of the blind welfare sub-associations, the blind will make more demands and the work will be passive. This concern is unnecessary. The fact is just the opposite. The blind welfare sub-association is an organizational form for uniting and educating the blind masses. If some excessive demands made by the blind that cannot be realized under the current conditions are explained through the sub-association, the blind are more likely to accept it.
    The blind people's production is a new cause. Although there will be some difficulties in the work, we are convinced that under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the active support of the state and the masses of the society, the blind masses will make a hundred times more efforts, work diligently and thriftily, establish and develop the blind people's production and realize their ideals—to contribute their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland and create their own happy life!

### 开辟盲人生产自立的道路

    开辟盲人生产自立的道路
    在中国共产党和人民政府的关怀下，新中国的盲人事业正在成长。今年，参加生产劳动的盲人有显著增加，并接连着出现了一些动人的新事情。如在上海举行了“全国青年盲人四项田径竞赛会”；在北京展览了各地盲人的生产成品；6月间，内务部和中国盲人福利会召开了有十五个省市代表参加的“盲人生产工作座谈会”，交流了扶持和组织盲人参加生产劳动的经验，将会促使盲人生产事业进一步发展。我国盲人群众已经深切地体会到，优越的社会主义制度，给他们带来无限美好和幸福的前途。
    旧社会剥夺了发挥盲人才智的一切可能，盲人被看成是“废物”，备受歧视和辱骂。在新社会里，盲人获得了和健全人一样的平等权利。随着社会主义经济建设的发展和盲人生产事业日益获得成就，我国盲人将逐步成为残而不废、自食其力的人。
    解放以来，党和政府对盲人群众从各方面给予关怀和照顾。首先是使他们的生活得到保障。盲人中有很大一部分生活非常困难，政府对他们都及时地给予必要的救济，使他们不再受饥寒的威胁；对无家可归、无依无靠的盲人，收容到各地残老教养院里，由国家供给生活费用，使这些人免于流浪，生养死葬都有了依靠。根据不完全的统计，各地收容教养的盲人有一万余人。其次，在扶持盲人生产，开展盲人教育，防盲和治盲等方面都进行了一些工作。例如，黑龙江省据不完全的统计，八年来经治疗而复明的盲人约在万人以上。然而，我国目前的盲人工作还相当落后，有些在当前条件下可能做的事情，没有做或者还做得不够。譬如，使大多数的农村青壮年盲人参加农业生产合作社的辅助劳动或副业生产；组织更多的城市盲人生产自救；集中失明的革命残废军人施以教育和训练，培养他们成为盲人工作的骨干；适当扩充现有的盲童学校，充实师资与设备，在没有盲童学校的省和大城市新建盲校等等，都并不是不可能做到的。
    盲人工作落后的原因，主要是因为旧社会遗留下来的轻视盲人的观点还普遍存在，有关部门的某些干部对这项工作不够重视，对盲人的能力和智慧不够了解，不知道怎样来安排盲人工作。有些干部还存在着单纯救济观点和恩赐观点，不重视扶持盲人参加生产劳动的工作，对盲人的根本要求和长远利益缺乏理解，这就不能发挥盲人群众的积极性和创造性。有些干部认为盲人生产就业问题要等到健全人的就业问题解决后才能解决，没有按照统筹兼顾、变消极因素为积极因素的精神来研究考虑盲人问题，使盲人工作得不到适当的安排。这些思想阻碍着盲人工作的开展。我们认为：为了更好地发展盲人生产，开展盲人工作，就必须打破一般人、特别是国家机关干部的轻盲观点；必须利用我国盲人在各种劳动战线上所取得的成就和苏联及其他国家盲人工作的先进事例，向社会进行广泛的宣传，以树立起新的社会道德和风习——把援助生理上有缺陷的人看做是人人应尽的义务和应有的高尚的品德。
    盲人工作的主要任务和中心环节，就是随着国家经济建设的发展，逐步扶持和组织盲人生产自立。除了少数盲人能培养他们从事其他职业以外，在过渡时期内，要逐渐使有劳动力的盲人能够通过参加各种各样的生产劳动的道路，摆脱经济上的依赖状态和政治上、文化上的落后状态，能够和健全人一样地参加各种社会活动，成为祖国社会主义的积极建设者。
    苏联盲人胜利地走过这条道路。如今，他们每个加盟共和国都建立了盲人自己的协会，在协会的领导下有许多盲人生产教学工厂。这些工厂里装备着为盲人专门设计的现代化机器，盲人能够生产精密的机件。盲人工厂的生产利润，除上缴国库外，盲人协会用来发展盲人生产和举办各种福利事业。苏联盲人工作所取得的成就，为我国树立了光辉的榜样。
    我国80％以上的盲人分布在广大的农村。在过去，分散的小农经济无法发挥盲人的劳动潜力，在今天农村已经合作化的条件下，农村青壮年盲人就有可能在农业生产合作社中得到适合于盲人的工作。据初步调查，盲人可以从事铡草、车水、积肥、打场、摇风车、饲养牲畜和家禽、编席、编筐篮、打草绳和其他辅助劳动，干得好的可以抵得上一个普通的全劳动力，差一些的也可以顶个半劳动力。目前农村盲人参加生产劳动的还不普遍，各地县区党组织应当注意这项工作。当然，农村盲人刚参加生产劳动的时候，技术不熟练，体力也会感到不够，但只要经过一段时期的锻炼，就可以克服这些困难。
    至于扶持城市盲人生产，应当采取“因地制宜”的方针。一般地区应以从事手工业为主，一些有条件的工业城市则可以建立半机械化或者机械化的生产。在吸收对象方面，一般地应当首先吸收生活困难的盲人。组织形式可以参加到现有的贫民生产单位，使盲人组成一个小组、一个车间，担任适合于盲人特点的工序。在有条件的城市，还应当建立以盲人为主（盲人占60％—70％）的工厂或生产合作社。因为盲人有共同的生理缺陷和共同的要求，集中在一起生产，便于管理和照顾。对各地集中在残老教养单位的盲人，应认真贯彻“分类教养”的方针。对于其中的青壮年盲人，应该注意培养他们学会生产技能，扶助他们自食其力，条件成熟时可以转为独立的盲人工厂或生产合作社。盲人生产发展的途径，应该逐步地从单纯手工业经过半机械化而最后实现机械化，从小到大、从附属到独立、从分散到集中，必须和我国整个国民经济的发展相适应。
    保证原料供应和产品销路是发展盲人生产事业的重要条件。由于目前盲人生产门路不多，盲人生产效率较低，生产经营上存在很多困难，需要各地手工业、供销、商业等部门在供产销方面予以支持和照顾。有些盲人生产品如铁钉、棉织品等，应当纳入地方的生产计划，以保证原料供应。地方民政部门和盲人福利分会在这项工作上必须争取有关部门的支援；同时，也需要积极争取社会群众对盲人事业的援助，例如盲人生产资金也可以从热心的社会人士——不论是集体或个人，得到资助。
    现在，北京等七个省市已经建立了盲人福利分会，这些地方的盲人生产和其他盲人福利工作都得到了进一步的发展。今后，盲人福利分会应当把扶持和组织盲人参加生产劳动作为主要任务。分会建立后工作又已经就绪的地方，就应该直接管理当地的盲人生产组织，帮助他们巩固和发展，对于参加在贫民生产单位中的盲人也应该给予适当照顾。凡是盲人人数较多、盲人群众迫切要求生产自立或者有盲人生产组织的城市，就可以建立盲人福利分会。各地民政部门应当把盲人福利分会作为开展盲人工作的有力助手，注意培养和吸收盲人代表人物参加分会的领导和日常工作，配备专职的不是盲人的干部协助。只有这样，才能培养出一批盲人工作的骨干，摸清盲人和盲人生产的特点，保证盲人的特殊需要和利益。有的地方民政部门担心成立盲人福利分会后，盲人要求多，工作被动，这种顾虑是不必要的。事实恰好相反，盲人福利分会是团结和教育盲人群众的一种组织形式。对于盲人提出的一些在当前条件下不能实现的过高要求，如果通过分会进行解释，则盲人更加容易接受。
    盲人生产事业是一项新的事业，虽然工作中会遇到一些困难，但是，我们确信：在党和政府的领导下，在国家和社会群众的积极支援下，盲人群众将会百倍地努力，克勤克俭，建立和发展盲人生产事业，实现他们的理想——把自己的力量供献给祖国社会主义建设，创造自己的幸福生活！
