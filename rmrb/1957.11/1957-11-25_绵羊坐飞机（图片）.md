    Sheep on a Plane
  The Civil Aviation Administration often dispatches aircraft to support agricultural and pastoral production. The above picture shows a batch of Xinjiang sheep being loaded onto a plane bound for Guizhou, ready for departure.
    The Xinjiang sheep is a very valuable breed with strong adaptability, suitable for both wool and meat production. They are plump and heavy, and the wool fibers are of good quality, suitable for spinning high-grade woolen fabrics of 60 counts or more.

    绵羊坐飞机
  民航局常常出动飞机支援农牧业生产。上图是运往贵州的一批新疆羊，正在装上飞机，准备启运。
    新疆羊是一种很有推广价值、适应性很强的毛肉兼用羊。体重膘肥，羊毛纤维质量好，可以纺织六十支纱以上的高级毛织品。
