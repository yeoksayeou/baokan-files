Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th: In Yi County, Liaoning Province, Quan Shan Bu Township, a place of continuous barren mountains and crisscrossing gullies, has launched a production and construction upsurge focused on water and soil conservation and the comprehensive management of mountainous areas. This came after refuting the wealthy middle peasants' argument that "carrying out mountainous area construction is like trying to quench thirst with distant water." Starting from October 20th, all five agricultural production cooperatives in the township, except for retaining about 20% of the labor force for a concentrated effort on threshing, sent all able-bodied people up the mountains. They planted more than 700 mu of young forests in the main gully upstream areas of existing and planned reservoirs, dug more than 34,000 fish-scale pits for water and soil conservation projects, and built more than 400 check dams. The construction of four new reservoirs capable of irrigating nearly 1,000 mu of land is also being accelerated.

	The Common Agricultural Production Cooperative began construction on a reservoir for both irrigation and fish farming in May of this year, which was once halted. In early October, when various cooperatives launched a major debate on cooperativization and the development of mountainous production, activists carefully calculated the accounts, explaining that the cost could be recovered in the year the reservoir was completed, and that income could increase year by year thereafter. After distinguishing right from wrong, the vast number of cooperative members actively participated in the construction. By October 28th, all projects except for the reservoir gate had been completed. The Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative also resumed work on a reservoir with a flood storage capacity of 80,000 cubic meters after the major debate, and two-thirds of it has now been completed. As early as last spring, the West Star Agricultural Production Cooperative built the township's first reservoir, with a flood storage capacity of more than 100,000 cubic meters. Not only did it irrigate 200 mu of land, increasing the yield by 200 jin per mu, but the 18,000 fish raised in the reservoir have grown to 1.5 to 3 jin each. More than 10,000 jin were sold in late October, generating an income of more than 4,000 yuan. The cooperative members also accepted the proposal of the cooperative director, Ma Jinglin, a model agricultural laborer in Liaoning Province, to start construction on a new reservoir with a flood storage capacity of 320,000 cubic meters, capable of irrigating 500 mu of land.

### 驳倒山区建设是“远水不解近渴”的谬论  全善卜乡出现治理山区高潮

    驳倒山区建设是“远水不解近渴”的谬论
    全善卜乡出现治理山区高潮
    新华社沈阳9日电　秃山绵亘、沟壑纵横的辽宁省义县全善卜乡，在驳倒富裕中农“进行山区建设是远水不解近渴”的言论之后，开始出现以水土保持为主全面治理山区的生产建设高潮。从10月20日开始，全乡五个农业生产合作社除留20％左右的劳动力突击打场以外，其他能劳动的人全部上山，在原有水库和拟修水库的主沟上游地带，造幼林七百多亩，新挖水土保持工程鱼鳞坑三万四千多个，修筑谷坊四百多道。四座可灌溉近千亩地的新水库，也正在加紧施工。
    共同农业生产合作社在今年5月动工修建一座灌溉、养鱼两用的水库，曾一度停工。10月上旬，各社展开合作化和发展山区生产的大辩论时，积极分子们算了细账，说明修成水库当年就能收回工本，以后还能逐年增加收益。广大社员辨明是非后积极参加施工，到10月28日，除水库闸门外，其他工程都已完成。光明农业生产合作社的一座蓄洪八万公方的水库，也在大辩论后复工，现已完成三分之二。西星农业生产合作社早在去年春天就修建了全乡第一座水库，蓄洪十多万公方，不但灌溉了二百亩地，使每亩增产二百斤粮，水库中养的一万八千尾鱼，每条已长到一斤半到三斤重，10月下旬卖了一万多斤，收入四千多元。这个社的社员们还接受社主任、辽宁省农业劳动模范马景林的提议，将要动工兴修一座蓄洪三十二万公方、灌地五百亩的新水库。
