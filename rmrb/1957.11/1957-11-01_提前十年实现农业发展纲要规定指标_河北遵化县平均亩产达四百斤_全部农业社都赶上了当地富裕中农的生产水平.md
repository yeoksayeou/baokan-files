Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 30th - With the great development of agricultural cooperation, agricultural production in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, has made a significant leap forward. This year, the average yield per mu in the county reached 400 jin. Thus, the county has achieved the targets set in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule; all 323 agricultural production cooperatives in the county have reached the production level of local rich middle peasants.

With the rapid development of agricultural production, the living standards of the broad masses of farmers have also greatly improved. The Jianming Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, which was ridiculed as a "poor stick cooperative" in the past, achieved an average yield of 503 jin per mu this year, and sold more than 210,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. In the past, Shashiyu Village, which relied on "bran and vegetables for half a year's food," will have a net ration of 550 jin of grain per person after completing the grain purchase task this year. In addition to income from forests, fruit trees, beekeeping, pig breeding, rabbit breeding, and land reclamation, the average annual income per person can reach more than 120 yuan, greatly exceeding the living standards of local rich middle peasants. Due to the increase in income of the broad masses, the grain consumption level of the people in the county has also greatly improved. This year, in addition to completing the state grain purchase task, the average estimated storage per person per year increased by 22% compared to 1952.

The main experiences of Zunhua County in achieving such a leap in agricultural production are: vigorously developing pig raising to increase fertilizer application, vigorously carrying out water conservancy construction, and leading cadres going deep into the grassroots and into reality to strengthen specific leadership over agricultural production. By September of this year, the number of live pigs in the county had increased to 300,939. Due to the large-scale development of pig raising, the amount of fertilizer applied increased from 2,000 jin per mu in 1954 to 4,500 jin. This county has dug a total of 5,341 wells of various types in the past year and this year, opened more than 90 canals, and built two "pot camel" machine stations, irrigating more than 180,000 mu of cultivated land, equivalent to twelve times the area of irrigated land in the county in 1952. In addition, more than 1,700 drainage canals have been dug in the past two years, benefiting more than 155,000 mu of land. In the mountainous areas, 259 flood control dams, six reservoirs, five river courses were adjusted, and 120 water diversion dams were built. These water conservancy constructions have played a significant role in ensuring increased agricultural production. Among the 17 members of the County Party Committee, four work in the countryside for three-quarters of the year, five work in the countryside for one-half of the year, and six work in the countryside for one-third of the year. This year, from spring to now, nearly 700 cadres with strong working abilities have been transferred from various agencies to the countryside to lead agricultural production. During the spring plowing and sowing season, the secretary and deputy secretary of the County Party Committee worked in the countryside for more than 90 days. Because the leading cadres of the county go deep into the lower levels and into practical work, directly lead agricultural production, and promptly discover and solve problems, they have promoted a great leap in agricultural production in the county.

    提前十年实现农业发展纲要规定指标
    河北遵化县平均亩产达四百斤
    全部农业社都赶上了当地富裕中农的生产水平
    新华社保定30日电　随着农业合作化的大发展，河北省遵化县的农业生产有了显著的跃进。今年全县平均亩产达到了四百斤。这样，该县提前十年实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的指标；全县三百二十三个农业生产合作社，全部赶上了当地富裕中农的生产水平。
    随着农业生产的迅速发展，广大农民的生活水平也有了很大的提高。过去被人讥笑为“穷棒子社”的建明农林牧生产社，今年平均亩产达到了五百零三斤，卖给国家二十一万斤余粮。过去“糠菜半年粮”的沙石峪村，今年完成征购任务以后，每人还能净分口粮五百五十斤，加上林木、果树、养蜂、养猪、养兔和开荒等收入，全年平均每人收入可达到一百二十多元，大大超过了当地富裕中农的生活水平。由于广大群众收入的增加，全县人民的粮食消费水平，也有了很大的提高。今年除完成国家征购任务外，平均每人全年估存量比1952年增加22％。
    遵化县农业生产能够这样跃进的主要经验是，大量发展养猪增施肥料、大力开展水利建设和领导干部深入基层深入实际，加强对农业生产的具体领导。全县生猪到今年9月，已经发展到三十万零九千三百九十三口，由于生猪的大量发展，施肥量由1954年每亩二千斤提高到四千五百斤。这个县去年和今年共打各种井五千三百四十一眼，开渠九十多道，修锅驼机站两处，灌溉耕地十八万多亩，相当于1952年全县水浇地面积的十二倍。此外，两年来还挖了泄水渠一千七百多条，受益土地达十五万五千多亩。在山区修了二百五十九座拦洪坝，六处蓄水池，调整了五处河道，建筑了一百二十座顺水坝等。这些水利建设，对保证农业增产起了很大的作用。全县十七名县委委员当中，有四名常年四分之三的时间下乡工作，五名二分之一的时间下乡工作，六名三分之一时间下乡工作。今年从春季到现在，先后从各机关抽调了近七百名工作能力较强的干部，下乡领导农业生产。春耕播种的时候，县委正、副书记下乡九十多天。由于县的领导干部深入下层、深入实际工作，直接领导农业生产，及时发现问题解决问题，促进了全县农业生产的大跃进。
