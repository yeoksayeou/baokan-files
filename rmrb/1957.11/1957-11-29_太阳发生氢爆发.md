Xinhua News Agency, 28th. TASS reports: The Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory in Georgia recently observed a strong hydrogen flare (ejection) on the sun using a chromosphere telescope. A large amount of hydrogen was ejected from the sun, and the hydrogen cloud rose to a height of hundreds of thousands of kilometers above the sun's surface in just five or six hours.

The sun is currently in the most active period of its eleven-year cycle. Large masses of material on the surface and in the "atmosphere" of the sun are being ejected with particular intensity, and sunspots are gradually expanding. In this situation, ultraviolet radiation and particle radiation (the ejection of charged particles from the sun) have a particularly large impact on various phenomena on Earth. The phenomena occurring above are currently being studied.

The Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory is one of the largest observatories in the Soviet Union. In recent years, this observatory has discovered a nova and ten asteroids, developed new photoelectric methods for studying changes in starlight, used new spectroscopic methods to determine the distances of several thousand stars, and compiled large color star charts for studying the distribution of galactic matter in interstellar space.

    太阳发生氢爆发
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社讯：格鲁吉亚的阿巴斯图马尼天文台最近用色球望远镜观测到太阳上发生的一次强烈的氢的爆发（喷射），太阳内部喷出了大量的氢，氢云仅在五、六个小时内，就上升到距太阳表面几十万公里的高空。
    目前太阳正处在十一年中活动最强烈的时期。太阳的表面和“大气中”大量的物质质团在特别猛烈地喷射，太阳的黑点正在逐渐扩大。在这种情况下，紫外线辐射，粒子辐射（太阳的带电粒子的喷射）对地球各种现象的影响特别大。目前，正在对上面发生的现象进行研究。
  阿巴斯图马尼天文台是苏联最大的天文台之一。最近几年这个天文台发现了一个新星和十个小行星，制定了研究星光变化的新的光电方法，用新的光谱方法，确定了几千个恒星的距离，编制了大型的彩色星图，以供研究天河物质在星际空间散布情况之用。
