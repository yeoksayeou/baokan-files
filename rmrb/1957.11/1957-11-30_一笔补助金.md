	A Subsidy 	Shenyang Starch Factory, Wei Qu
	After noon, the union committee discussed the issue of hardship subsidies for members. As the meeting was about to end, Liu, the welfare committee member, proposed a new subsidy recipient:
	"Old Chen, who watches the big tea boiler, has been wearing a faded, tattered cotton-padded coat for several years, patched upon patched, and his family is also living in tight circumstances. Although he himself hasn't brought it up, our union should provide a subsidy based on the specific situation."
	"Agreed!" The committee members almost simultaneously raised their hands, and I raised both hands in support.
	To ensure that every hardship subsidy is accurate, before reporting it to the higher-level union, the committee members instructed me to further investigate at Old Chen's home.
	The next morning, I rode my bicycle to Old Chen's house. The furnishings in the house were very simple, but they were arranged neatly and tidily. Afterwards, I also inquired with the neighbors: according to family members, Old Chen and Aunt Chen were very frugal in managing the household. - To be honest, with a monthly income of forty-seven yuan, and a family of five or six, averaging less than eight yuan per person, they had no choice but to be frugal.
	More than a week later, at noon, I happily delivered the thirty-yuan hardship subsidy to Old Chen at the tea boiler room. Old Chen looked at the money, looked at me, somewhat confused.
	"Why are you giving me this money?" Old Chen asked me.
	"This is a hardship subsidy from the union, everyone agreed," I said.
	"I'm not in hardship, give it to someone else!" He handed the money back to me.
	"Do you have an objection?" I pushed the money back to him.
	"I'm really not in hardship!" He pushed the money back to me again.
	I took the money, the happy feeling I had earlier had long vanished. I thought: I didn't give you a subsidy in the past only because you didn't apply—if you don't say anything, who knows you're in hardship! You clearly have objections but don't mention them, instead pretending to be "not in hardship"...
	Back at the union office, I told them about this unpleasant incident. The union chairman and Liu both said that my analysis was wrong, saying that Old Chen wasn't that kind of person, but was just embarrassed to accept it, and told me to deliver the money to his house.
	After work in the afternoon, I went to Old Chen's house again. Aunt Chen poured me a glass of boiled water, Old Chen let me sit on the kang, and the children all consciously went outside to play.
	"The union is the home of us workers, you should accept the subsidy," I stuffed the thirty yuan into Old Chen's hands.
	Old Chen seemed a little angry, he threw the money on the kang, and didn't say anything. He took off his shoes and took out a small bundle from a large willow basket on the kang. He opened the small bundle, and a brand new small notebook was revealed.
	"Look! It will prove that I am not lying to you," Old Chen handed me the small notebook.
	"Ah! Isn't this a savings account!" I took it and almost said it out loud.
	I started reading from the cover, the light blue cover had Old Chen's name written on it, and "May 2, 1956," and other such words; opening it up, it showed that from the day he started saving, he had saved three yuan every month; in the nineteen months up to November 15th of this year, he had saved a full fifty-seven yuan. This amount, these densely packed Arabic numerals, surprised me!
	"Since that's the case, why don't you replace this tattered cotton-padded coat?" I said, pointing to Old Chen's tattered cotton-padded coat. "You're getting old, a cotton-padded coat isn't warm enough, what will you do if you get cold!"
	"Don't even mention it, Comrade Wang!" Aunt Chen interjected. "Last autumn, I bought cloth, preparing to make a cotton-padded coat for him, but he wouldn't, and the cloth was ruined by the children; this year, when we received new cloth coupons, I was going to make him a cotton-padded coat, and he agreed. Who knew that after a few days, he changed his mind again, saying 'The country is calling for the conservation of cotton cloth, our cotton-padded coat can still last through the winter, we'll make it after the New Year, and return half of the cloth coupons to the street office...' He has great revolutionary principles, I can't argue with him..."
	"Go do your work! What's it got to do with you!" Old Chen didn't let her finish, but a smile appeared on his face. Aunt Chen seemed very obedient, only saying "You'll just lecture us old women about revolution!" and didn't say anything more.
	I respectfully gave the savings account back to Old Chen, and picked up the thirty-yuan subsidy from the kang. I knew that this old man had a strange temper, if I forced this money on him, he would definitely get angry.
	Old Chen and Aunt Chen saw me out the door. I bid farewell to them, and as I stepped out the door, I don't know why, I even bowed a few times.

### 一笔补助金

    一笔补助金	沈阳淀粉厂　未曲
    过午，工会委员会讨论会员困难补助问题。会议将要结束的时候，生活福利委员大刘提出了一个新的补助户：
    “看大茶炉的老陈头几年以来一直是一件褪色的破棉袄过冬，补钉加补钉，家里也过的挺紧。虽然他本人没有提出来，我们工会也应当根据具体情况给予补助。”
    “同意！”委员们几乎同时举起手来，我是举双手赞成。
    为了让每一笔困难补助金都不出错儿，趁还没有报上级工会以前，委员们嘱托我到老陈家再行了解一次。
    第二天一早，我骑着自行车到了老陈头的家里。屋里的摆设虽然极简单，可是收拾的倒是整洁利索。之后我还向左右邻居打听了一些：据家属们反映，老陈头和陈大娘治家很俭朴。——这，说实在的，一个月四十七元钱的工资收入，大大小小一家五六口，平均每人还不到八元钱，不俭朴也不行。
    一个多礼拜以后的响午，我高高兴兴地把三十元钱困难补助金送到茶炉房老陈头的手里。老陈头看了看钱，瞅了瞅我，有些莫名其妙。
    “干啥给我这些钱？”老陈头问我。
    “工会给你的困难补助，大伙都同意。”我说。
    “咱不困难，给别人吧！”他把钱递给我。
    “你是有意见？”我又把钱塞给他。
    “咱真的不困难！”他又把钱推给我。
    我接过钱来，原来那股高兴劲头早就烟消云散了。心想：过去没有给你补助，只怪你不申请——你不吱声，谁知道你困难呢！明明白白你是有意见不提，却硬装着“不困难”……。
    回到工会办公室，我把这件不愉快的事情讲了。工会主席和大刘都说我分析错了，说老陈头不是这号人，只是不好意思要罢了，要我把这笔钱送到他家去。
    午后下了班，我又到了老陈头的家里。陈大娘给我倒了一杯开水，老陈头把我让在炕上坐下，孩子们都自觉地到外面玩去了。
    “工会是咱工人的家，给你补助你就应该收下。”我把三十元钱塞给老陈头。
    老陈头似乎有点生气的样子，他把钱往炕上一撂，没有说什么。只见他脱了鞋，从炕上一个大柳条包里拿出来一个小包袱。他把小包袱打开，一个崭新的小本从包袱里露了出来。
    “你看！它会证明我不是跟你撒谎的。”老陈头把小本递给我。
    “啊！这不是存折吗！”我接过来，几乎大声说了出来。
    我从封皮看起，浅蓝色的封皮上写着老陈头的名字，写着“1956年5月2日”等等之类的字样；打开里面，里面写着从开始蓄存那一天起，每月都存了三元钱；到今年11月15日的十九个月里，足足存了五十七元钱。这个数目，这些密密麻麻的阿拉伯字码，倒使我吃了一惊！
    “既然这样，你为啥不换这件破棉袄呢？”我指着老陈头的破棉袄说。“年纪大了，棉袄不抗寒，冻着怎办！”
    “你可别提了，王同志！”陈大娘抢着说。“去年秋天俺买了布，准备给他做棉袄，他不干，把布给孩子们糟蹋了；今年领来新布票那咱，俺就张罗给他做件棉袄，他答应了。谁知道过不了几天，他又变卦了，说‘国家号召节约棉布，咱棉袄还能对付一冬，过年再做，把布票退回一半给街道办事处……。’他有革命大道理，俺说不过他……。”
    “去做你的活吧！关你啥事！”老陈头不让她说，脸上却泛出了笑容。陈大娘似乎很听话，只说了声“你就会给俺们老太太讲革命！”就没吱声了。
    我把存折恭恭敬敬地给了老陈头，把三十元补助金从炕上拿起来。我知道，这个老头有个怪脾气，如果我硬把这笔钱给了他，他非冒火不行。
    老陈头和陈大娘把我送出门外。我向他们告别，在跨出门口的那一忽儿，不知道为啥，我还行了几个鞠躬礼。
