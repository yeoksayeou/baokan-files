Xinhua News Agency, November 27th: The "18th-20th Century Russian Painting Exhibition," sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, closed on the 26th. During the three-week exhibition, more than 83,000 artists, art workers, and art enthusiasts from all walks of life visited the exhibition. Many of them came from the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, Xi'an, Jinan, and other places.

Many visitors enthusiastically praised the exhibited Russian masterpieces in the comment book.

The artist Wu Zuoren said: Through the original works, we have come to understand the unique spiritual essence of modeling art, such as the gradation of oil painting tones and the coming and going of brushstrokes, which can never be replaced by a reproduction.

During the exhibition, a large number of letters were received requesting an extension of the exhibition time and the publication of an album.

This exhibition is about to be shown in Shanghai.

    八万人看了俄罗斯名画
    新华社27日讯　中国人民对外文化协会主办的“十八—二十世纪俄罗斯绘画展览会”在26日闭幕。在为时三周的展出期间，有美术家、美术工作者和爱好美术的各界人士八万三千多人参观了展览会。其中有不少人来自东北、内蒙古和西安、济南等地。
    很多参观者在意见簿上热烈赞颂展出的俄罗斯名画。
    美术家吴作人说：通过原作，使我们了解到了油画的色调参差，笔踪来去等造型艺术的独特精神面貌，这绝非一帧复制品所能替代的。
    展览会在展出期间接到了大批来信，要求延长展览时间和出版画册。
    这个展览会即将到上海展出。
