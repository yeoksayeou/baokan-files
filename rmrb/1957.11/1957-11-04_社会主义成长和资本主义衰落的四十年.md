    Forty Years of Socialist Growth and Capitalist Decline
    Soviet Union Ye. Varga
    Forty years ago, the Russian working class, united with the laboring peasantry, victoriously completed the socialist revolution, opening a new era in world history – an era of capitalist decline and the expansion and growth of socialism.
    Lenin's brilliant principle that imperialism is dying capitalism was first verified by life with the victory of the October Revolution. Like all eras of transition from one social system to another, the imperialist period is an era of revolution and counter-revolution, an era of great trials and sharp struggles between the old and the new. Those who rely solely on the old system, which is historically bound to perish, use every means at their disposal to desperately defend the old system.
    The history of this era has unique dialectical laws. Socialism is a new system on the rise, and from an objective historical point of view, its progress is irresistible. At the same time, socialist countries have always advocated peaceful coexistence with capitalist countries. This is perfectly understandable: Marxism-Leninism teaches us (and the experience of the past forty years has confirmed this) that the laws of development inherent in capitalism, absolutely and everywhere, prepare the conditions for the victory of the socialist revolution. "Export of revolution" is neither possible nor necessary.
    From a historical point of view, capitalism is on the decline, but it has repeatedly attempted to overthrow socialism by force and pursue a policy of aggression. It is only because of the fear that the failure of the capitalist system would inevitably lead to its final collapse that the aggressors now dare not recklessly launch a new armed attack on the socialist world.
    Before the First World War, the international bourgeoisie always believed that its rule was solid and would last forever. At that time, the bourgeoisie dominated the entire world, although many countries were still dominated by pre-capitalist social relations. Even in many highly developed countries, remnants of feudalism still existed: with the exception of France and Switzerland, almost all European countries were monarchies. But despite this, the bourgeoisie effectively ruled the entire world, exploiting all countries, including the most backward.
    At the beginning of the First World War, the leaders of socialist parties in various countries colluded with "their own" bourgeoisie and voted for military loans in parliaments; they concluded "class peace" with capitalists during the war. With the exception of the Russian Bolshevik Party established by Lenin, no socialist party put the practical task of overthrowing bourgeois rule on the agenda. The leaders of the Western European workers' movements did not establish combat parties like the Bolshevik Party, aimed at preparing and leading the proletarian revolution. The Western workers' leaders did not raise the issue of the allies that the proletariat could find in the struggle against the bourgeoisie; they did not carry out work among the army and the peasants.
    They believed that the "ultimate goal" was too vague, and the road to achieving this goal was as if shrouded in a thick fog. Deep down, like the bourgeoisie, they believed that capitalism would exist forever. Therefore, almost all of them ("orthodox Marxists" Karl Kautsky, "leftists" Otto Bauer, Martov, and others), after the victory of the October Revolution, all opposed the Bolshevik Party together with the world bourgeoisie, opposing the only country that had begun to realize the ultimate goal of socialism in practice...①
    The long-standing belief in the unshakeable nature of the capitalist social system played a decisive role in the world bourgeoisie's initial reactions to the Russian proletariat's seizure of power. "Outrageous! Unbelievable! Simply impossible!" Such cries were everywhere. "How can a country live and operate without the bourgeoisie? How can modern civilization and culture exist without respecting the foundation of sacred private property? The proletarian regime will not last long; it will soon collapse. This is simply a historical mistake!"②
    The reaction of class-conscious revolutionary workers in the capitalist world to the October Revolution was completely different. The victory of the Russian proletariat showed them that the ultimate goal of the socialist workers' movement was by no means vague, uncertain, or distant. If the leadership is in the hands of a truly revolutionary party, then, under corresponding specific conditions and after careful preparation, this goal can be achieved in our time.
    Soon, the struggle for the proletariat to seize power quickly broke out in Hungary and Bavaria; it is true that those struggles either failed or achieved only temporary success. However, one of the main conditions for success was not met there - a long-tempered Marxist-Leninist communist party! The leaders of the Social Democratic Party, with very few exceptions (such as Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht, Clara Zetkin), mostly stood on the side of the bourgeoisie in these battles. Hölz, Noske, and their ilk were the main organizers of the bloody suppression of the vanguard of the German proletariat.
    After recovering from the initial shock, the world bourgeoisie immediately launched an armed struggle against the Soviet Republic. German imperialists forcibly occupied the southern and western parts of our country, forcing the young Soviet Republic to conclude the predatory Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with it. The German bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie of the Entente countries used money, weapons, and diplomatic means, and by means of an economic blockade of the Soviet state, to support the counter-revolutionary forces within Russia. After each routine failure, the counter-revolutionaries regrouped their forces, led by Yudenich, Denikin, Kolchak, and Wrangel, to launch new offensives. Churchill organized an anti-Soviet crusade of fourteen countries.
    However, the country that had already achieved the victory of the socialist revolution repelled all the offensives. The situation was very serious. After years of war, our country had become extremely impoverished. Famine caused death everywhere. Transportation was paralyzed, there was no coal, and families could hardly light a fire. The Red Army was extremely short of equipment. The Russian heartland, where Soviet power was consolidated, was cut off from the border areas (the source of food, fuel, and raw materials) for a considerable period of time.
    However, the socialist revolution led by the Communist Party headed by Lenin victoriously emerged from this great ordeal. The Party tirelessly called on the workers to engage in selfless struggle and promote organization, and guided the laboring peasants to the revolution by distributing the landlords' land.
    The October Revolution received enormous support from the revolutionary workers in the West, such as the German Revolution, the proletarian dictatorship in Hungary, the "Hands Off Russia!" movement in Britain, and so on.
    After the defeat of Wrangel, the Russian landlords, capitalists, and their accomplices temporarily ceased their armed struggle against the Soviet regime. The backbone of the bourgeois-landlord counter-revolution was destroyed. The most active counter-revolutionaries were eliminated in battle, and those who managed to save their lives fled abroad.③ The foreign bourgeoisie shifted from open intervention to economic blockade, diplomatic struggle, and a policy of "non-recognition."
    From then on, the Soviet Union had a twenty-year period of relative peace. Only in 1938-1939 did the Soviet Union have to use force to repel the Japanese invasion in the Far East. This period was a period of economic, organizational, and political consolidation for the Soviet Union. The internal contradictions of capitalism gradually invalidated the anti-Soviet economic blockade. Some of the bourgeoisie understood that they could no longer fantasize about the rapid collapse of the Soviet regime, so they were willing to resume trade with Russia.
    The British Labour government "recognized" the Soviet state, which was a minimal realization of the demands of the British working class. The world bourgeoisie had to recognize the existence of the Soviet Union. However, throughout this period, the Soviet Union remained the only socialist country surrounded by capitalist countries.
    This situation persisted until the end of the Second World War.
    During this period, capitalism and socialism developed in different ways. In the capitalist camp, after the failure of the German revolution, the tense revolutionary situation was contained, and the working class was split due to the betrayal of the right-wing social democrats. However, the stability of capitalism was only temporary, while the socialism of the Soviet Union was thoroughly stable.
    The stability of capitalism is relative and will not last long. Its inherent laws further sharpened the crisis of the entire system. In the economic field, capitalism suffered the most profound crisis in history - the crisis of overproduction in 1929-1933 and the ensuing long period of depression. In domestic politics, the bourgeoisie in many countries (such as Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Portugal, Spain) could no longer maintain their rule by relying on the traditional bourgeois democratic system, so they turned to fascism, which further sharpened class contradictions. In foreign policy, imperialist contradictions and the struggle for colonies became increasingly fierce. Japan invaded China, Italy invaded Abyssinia, Italy and Germany invaded republican Spain, and Germany successively violated all its neighbors. This situation continued until the individual wars had not yet evolved into the Second World War that swept the world.
    The Second World War began as a war between imperialist powers, but after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, the war essentially became a duel between the Soviet Union and the forces of the European continent under Hitler's rule. As a result, an anti-Hitler alliance was formed, with Western countries, the United States, and Britain joining the alliance with the Soviet Union. However, the ruling classes of the Western countries were hostile to the Soviet Union and socialism, and they adopted a sinister policy aimed at prolonging the war and weakening both the Soviet Union and Germany, hoping that the outcome would force both countries to accept conditions for peace.
    The leaders of the Western countries, who did not understand the laws of historical development, were greatly disappointed. After heroic struggles under extremely difficult conditions, the Soviet people not only repelled Hitler's offensive, but also drove his defeated troops out of the entire Eastern Europe, all the way to Berlin, until the enemy completely surrendered. Although the Soviet Union suffered enormous economic losses after this severe war, it was greatly consolidated in terms of political and social relations because of this war. And capitalism entered the next stage of its decline. (To be continued)

    社会主义成长和资本主义衰落的四十年
    苏联　叶·瓦尔加
    四十年前，俄国工人阶级联合劳动农民胜利地完成了社会主义革命，在世界史上开辟了一个新的时代——资本主义衰落的时代、社会主义扩展和成长的时代。
    无产阶级革命的天才列宁所提出的关于帝国主义是垂死的资本主义这一意义极其深刻的原理，随着十月革命的胜利，第一次被生活所证实。正如由一个社会制度向另一个社会制度过渡的一切时代一样，帝国主义时期是革命和反革命的时代，是有着巨大考验和新旧之间尖锐斗争的时代。那些专靠历史上必然趋于灭亡的旧制度坐享其成的人，使尽他们的一切手段拚死命来保卫旧的制度。
    这个时代的历史，有着独特的辩证规律。社会主义是方兴未艾的新制度，从客观历史上看来，它的前进是不可阻挡的。同时，社会主义国家一向主张同资本主义国家和平相处。这是完全可以理解的：马克思列宁主义教导我们（近四十年的经验也证实这一点），资本主义所固有的发展规律，不论在任何地方都绝对地在为社会主义革命的胜利准备条件。“革命输出”是不可能、也是不必要的事情。
    用历史观点来看，资本主义在走下坡路，但是，它一再妄图凭靠武力推翻社会主义而奉行侵略政策。只是因为害怕失败了资本主义制度就必然最后崩溃，所以侵略者现在才不敢放肆地对社会主义世界发动新的武装进攻。
    第一次世界大战以前，国际资产阶级总以为它的江山稳固万世永存。当时资产阶级支配着整个世界，虽然还有许多国家是前资本主义的社会关系占优势。甚至在许多高度发达的国家，也还存在着封建制度的残余：除了法国和瑞士而外，几乎整个欧洲的国家都是以君主立国。但是，尽管这样，资产阶级实地在统治着整个世界，剥削包括最落后的国家在内的一切国家。
    在第一次世界大战初期，各国的社会主义政党首脑人物都同“自己的”资产阶级串连起来，并在国会中表决军事借款；在战时同资本家缔结“阶级和平”。除了列宁建立的俄国布尔什维克党以外，没有一个社会主义政党把推翻资产阶级统治的实际任务提到日程上来。西欧各国工人运动的首领们，没有建立过像布尔什维克党那样，以准备和领导无产阶级革命为目的的战斗的党。西方工人首领们没有提出过在同资产阶级斗争中无产阶级可能找到的同盟军的问题；他们没有在军队和农民中间进行工作。
    他们认为，“最终目的”渺茫得很，而达到这个目的的道路也像在九里雾中一样。在他们的灵魂深处，正如资产阶级一样，相信资本主义会永久存在下去。因此，几乎他们所有的人（“正统派马克思主义者”卡尔·考茨基、“左派”奥托·鲍威尔、马尔托夫及其他等人），在十月革命胜利以后，全都同世界资产阶级一道反对布尔什维克党，反对着手在实践中实现社会主义最终目的的唯一一个国家……①
    深信资本主义社会制度不可动摇的由来已久的看法，在世界资产阶级对俄国无产阶级掌握政权的最初一批反应中起了决定作用。“可恶已极！令人不能置信！简直不可能！”这样的叫嚣到处都是。“一个国家没有资产阶级，怎么能够生活下去和经营得了呢？如果不尊重神圣的私有财产这个基础，现代文明和文化怎么能够存在呢？无产阶级政权的寿命不会久长，它很快就该垮台了。这简直是历史的错误！”②
    资本主义世界中有阶级觉悟的革命工人，对十月革命则完全是另一种反响，俄国无产阶级的胜利，向他们表明：社会主义工人运动的最终目的，完全不是什么渺茫难测、遥遥无期的事情，如果领导权掌握在真正革命的政党手里，那么在相应的具体条件下，经过深思熟虑的准备，这个目的在我们的时代就能够实现。
    不久，无产阶级夺取政权的斗争很快就在匈牙利和巴伐利亚爆发了；不错，那些斗争要么失败了，要么只是取得一时的成功。但是，那里没有达到成功的主要条件之一——久经锻炼的马克思列宁主义的共产党！社会民主党的首领们，除极少数是例外（如罗查·卢森堡、卡尔·李卜克内西、克拉拉·蔡特金）他们大多数在这些战斗中都是站在资产阶级方面的，赫尔辛、诺斯克及其一流人，是对德国无产阶级革命先锋队进行血腥镇压的主要组织者。
    世界资产阶级在从经受了第一次震惊以后，立即对苏维埃共和国展开了武装斗争。德国帝国主义者用武力侵占了我国的南部和西部，迫使年青的苏维埃共和国同它缔结了掠夺性的布列斯特和约。德国资产阶级和协约国各国的资产阶级用金钱、武器和外交手段，并借助于对苏维埃国家的经济封锁，来支持俄国国内的反革命势力。在每一次照例失败之后，反革命派又重新搜罗自己的力量，由尤登尼奇、邓尼金、高尔察克、弗兰格尔领导，来发动新的进攻。丘吉尔组织过十四个国家的反苏十字军。
    但是，已经取得社会主义革命胜利的国家，击退了一切的进犯。局势严重得很。经历几年战火之后，我国已经变得异常贫困了。饥馑到处造成死亡。运输停顿了，没有煤，家家户户几乎无法生火。红军的装备极度匮乏。苏维埃政权巩固的俄国中部，在相当长的时间里，同边区（粮食、燃料和原料产地）隔绝了。
    但是，以列宁为首的共产党领导的社会主义革命，胜利地从极大的考验中走过来了。党不倦地号召工人从事忘我斗争和发扬组织性，并用分配地主土地的方法把劳动农民引导到革命方面来。
    十月革命从西方革命的工人那里得到了巨大的支援，如德国的革命、匈牙利的无产阶级专政、英国的“不许干涉俄国！”运动等等。
    在弗兰格尔溃败以后，俄国的地主、资本家及其同谋者暂时停止了对苏维埃政权的武装斗争。资产阶级—地主反革命派的骨干被摧毁了。最积极的反革命分子在战斗中被消灭了，侥幸保住了性命的都逃到外国去了③。外国资产阶级从公开的干涉转而采取经济封锁，外交斗争，以及“不承认”政策。
    从这以后，苏联有了二十年的相对和平时期。只有1938—1939年，苏联不得不用武力在远东击退了日本的进犯。这个时期是苏联在经济上、组织上和政治上进行整顿的时期。资本主义的内在矛盾，使反苏的经济封锁逐渐失效。一部分资产阶级明白了：不能再幻想苏维埃政权迅速垮台了，于是他们愿意同俄国恢复贸易。
    英国工党政府“承认”了苏维埃国家，这是极起码地实现了英国工人阶级的要求。世界资产阶级不得不认许苏联的存在。但是，在这整个时期内，苏联仍然是被资本主义国家包围的唯一社会主义国家。
    这个局面一直保持到第二次世界大战结束为止。
    在这个时期内，资本主义和社会主义以各不相同的方式在发展着。在资本主义阵营中，德国革命失败之后，紧张的革命局势被遏止了，由于右翼社会民主党人的背叛，工人阶级被分裂了。但是，资本主义的稳定只是暂时的，而苏联的社会主义却是彻底地稳定了。
    资本主义的稳定是相对的、不会长久的。它的内在规律使得整个制度的危机进一步尖锐化。在经济方面，资本主义遭到了历史上最深刻的一次危机——1929—1933年的生产过剩危机和接着而来的长时期的萧条。在内政方面，许多国家（例如意大利、德国、奥地利、匈牙利、葡萄牙、西班牙）的资产阶级，已不可能再凭靠历来的资产阶级民主制度来维持自己的统治地位了，因此转而实行法西斯制度，这就使得阶级矛盾进一步尖锐化。在对外政策方面，帝国主义的矛盾、争夺殖民地的斗争，越来越激烈了。日本进攻中国，意大利进攻阿比西尼亚，意大利和德国进攻共和政体的西班牙，德国逐一地侵犯它的一切邻国，在个别的战争还没有演变成席卷全世界的第二次世界大战以前，这种形势一直在继续着。
    第二次世界大战开始是帝国主义列强间的战争，但在希特勒进攻苏联以后，战争就基本上变成苏联同处在希特勒权力统治下的欧洲大陆势力的决斗。结果，产生了一个反希特勒的联盟，西方国家、美国和英国，和苏联一起参加了这个联盟。但是西方国家的统治阶级敌视苏联和社会主义，它们采取了目的在于拖延战争并使苏联和德国两败俱伤的阴险政策，指望结局会迫使这两个国家有可能接受媾和的条件。
    不了解历史发展规律的西方国家领导人大失所望。苏联人民在非常困难的情况下，经过英勇斗争，不仅打退了希特勒的进攻，而且把他的败残的军队赶出整个东欧，一直赶到柏林，直到敌人完全投降为止。虽然苏联经过这场严重的战争后，经济上遭受到巨大的损失，但在政治和社会关系方面却因为这次战争而十分巩固了。而资本主义则进入了它的衰落的下一个阶段。　　（未完）
