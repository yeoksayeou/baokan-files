The Nightmare of Housewives
    — All Kinds of Frauds

    Not long ago, the American "Better Business Bureau" Association published statistics on fraud cases reported by the American people to the organization in 1956. According to this extremely incomplete statistic, which is far from representing the overall situation in the United States, as many as 438,430 fraud cases were reported to local "Better Business Bureaus" affiliated with the association in 1956, an increase of 10.6% compared to 1955, and two and a half times that of 1949. According to the Seattle "Better Business Bureau," the city's 350,000 male and female employees each lose an average of $50 annually due to fraud.

    The American "Better Business Bureau" Association's report points out that various frauds cause a total loss of $1.5 billion annually, of which:

    $500 million from home repair scams; $500 million from "get rich quick at home" scams; $200 million from charity scams; $100 to $150 million from counterfeit stocks; and $150 million from fake medicines, substandard goods, and other scams.

    American housewives are the main victims of these bizarre and ever-changing frauds. Home repair companies often send people to visit housewives and say, "We are planning to hold an exhibition of home repairs, painting, and decoration in this residential area, and we hope to use your house as an exhibition model. If you agree, we will repair, paint, and decorate your house, charging only the fairest fees. For each transaction completed during the exhibition, we will pay you a reward of $50 per transaction." Greedy housewives often find that the so-called exhibition is complete nonsense; the exorbitant repair, painting, and decoration costs make them regret it immensely.

    American newspapers often carry advertisements like this: "Anyone who wants to request a 'Get Rich Quick at Home Guide' should send one dollar to a certain address and will receive a satisfactory answer." Many housewives have been deceived by such advertisements. Some housewives receive ridiculous answers, such as: "Since you are a housewife, why not make some pies and sell them on the street!"

    In addition, mail-order goods, children's toys, plant seeds, Christmas cards... all kinds of miscellaneous items contain traps, and you can easily be fooled if you are not careful. Most shamefully, many helpless elderly people have been swindled out of their pensions, which they rely on for survival. (Le Shan)

    家庭妇女的梦魇
    ——无奇不有的骗诈
    不久以前，美国“商业改良局”协会发表了1956年该组织所收到的美国人民申诉被骗案件的统计。根据这个极不完整的、远不能代表美国全面情况的统计，1956年向该协会所属各地“商业改良局”申诉的被骗案件计达四十三万八千四百三十宗之多，比1955年增加10．6％，为1949年的两倍半。据西雅图市的“商业改良局”估计，该市三十五万男女职工每人每年平均被骗诈损失五十美元。
    美国“商业改良局”协会的报告指出，各种骗诈造成的损失每年总计十五亿美元，其中：
    房屋修理的讹诈五亿美元；“足不出户、发财致富”的骗局五亿美元；慈善事业的骗诈二亿美元；伪造股票一亿至一亿五千万美元；假药、劣货等类骗局一亿五千万美元。
    美国家庭妇女是这些无奇不有、光怪陆离的骗诈的主要牺牲者。房屋修理公司往往派人登门拜访家庭主妇说：“我们准备在这个住宅区举办一个房屋修理、粉刷、装饰的展览，希望利用你的住宅作为展览模型。如果同意，我们就对你的住宅进行修理、粉刷、装饰，只收最公平的费用。展览期间达成的每件交易，我们按件给你酬劳五十美元。”贪便宜的家庭主妇往往发现所谓展览完全是鬼话；修理、粉刷、装饰费用的浩大使她们后悔莫及。
    美国报刊上经常有这样的广告：“凡欲函索‘足不出户、发财致富指南’者，请附款一元径寄某处，当可收到满意答复。”不少的家庭妇女都受过这类广告的欺骗。有些家庭妇女收到一些令人啼笑皆非的答复，例如：“既然你是一个家庭的主妇，你不妨做一些馅饼到大街上去叫卖！”
    此外，邮购商品、儿童玩具、植物种子、圣诞贺片……各种零星用具，无一不存在着陷阱，一不小心就要上当。最可耻的是，许多无依无靠的老年人竟被骗去了赖以活命的养老金。（乐山）
