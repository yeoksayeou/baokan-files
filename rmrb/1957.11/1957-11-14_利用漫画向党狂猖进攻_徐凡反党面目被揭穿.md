    Using Cartoons to Frenziedly Attack the Party
    Xu Fan's Anti-Party Face Exposed

    (Our dispatch) The rightist face of Xu Fan, deputy director of the general editorial office and head of the art group of the Hunan Worker's Daily, has been exposed.

    Xu Fan launched a series of attacks against the Party. He slandered Hunan's art work as a "complete mess." He slandered the Hunan Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department's Literature and Art Section, the Provincial Cultural Bureau, and the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles as "not even clear about the basic tasks and responsibilities of their own departments." He also shamelessly clamored that Hunan's art workers were "orphans without a mother," inciting art workers to stage an "orphan seeking its mother at a nunnery."

    For a long time, Xu Fan has been using cartoons in newspapers as a tool against the Party and against socialism. He has resisted the Party's literary and artistic direction in many ways. He has always been unwilling to go deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, unwilling to go into the heat of the struggle, believing that this would waste time and hinder creation.

    利用漫画向党狂猖进攻
    徐凡反党面目被揭穿
    本报讯　湖南工人报总编室副主任兼美术组组长徐凡的右派面目已被揭穿。
    徐凡向党作了一系列的进攻。他诬蔑湖南美术工作“一团糟”。他诬蔑中共湖南省委宣传部文艺处、省文化局和省文联“连本部门的基本任务和职责范围都闹不明确”，他还无耻地叫嚣湖南美术工作者是“没有娘的儿”，煽动美术工作者来一个“庵堂认母”。
    徐凡长期在报纸上利用漫画作为反党反社会主义的工具。并多方抗拒党的文艺方针。他一直不愿意深入到工农兵中去生活，不愿到火热的斗争中去生活，认为这样会耽误时间，妨碍创作。
