　　A Police Officer's Salute!

　　When I came home from work, as soon as I entered the door, my five-year-old son, Xinmin, busily told me:
　　“Dad! Xiyun found five yuan today and gave it to the police officer. The police officer even saluted him like this.” While saying this, he raised his hand and imitated a salute. It seemed that the child was excitedly and proudly reporting this matter to me, so much so that I didn't quite understand what was going on at first. After I asked again, I learned that Xiyun, the five-year-old child from the family across the street who makes shoe uppers, and a group of children found five yuan while playing on the road and gave it to the police officer. To commend the children's noble morality, the police officer enthusiastically saluted the children.

    警察叔叔的敬礼！
    当我下班回到家中的时候，一进屋门，五岁的小儿子新民就忙着向我说：
  “爸爸！西运今天拾了五块钱，交给了警察叔叔，警察叔叔还这样的对他敬了个礼。”一边说着，一边还举起手来学着敬礼的样子，看来孩子是在兴奋和骄傲的情绪中激动地向我报告这一件事情的，以致使我一时还听不大清楚是怎么回事。等我再问了一遍，才知道是对门扎鞋帮子家五岁的孩子西运和一伙孩子们在路上玩耍时，拾到了五块钱，交给了警察叔叔，警察叔叔为了表扬孩子们的高尚道德，就热情地向孩子们敬了个礼。
