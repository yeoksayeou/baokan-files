They all emphasized the world historical significance of the October Revolution and the importance of strengthening friendship with the Soviet Union and strengthening the unity of socialist countries.

After the speech by Comrade Mao Zedong, head of the Chinese delegation, the following comrades spoke: Comrade Gomulka, head of the Polish delegation; Comrade Novotny, head of the Czechoslovak delegation; Comrade Ulbricht, head of the German Democratic Republic delegation; Comrade Stoica, head of the Romanian delegation; Comrade Zhivkov, head of the Bulgarian delegation; Comrade Kardelj, head of the Yugoslav delegation; Comrade Kadar, head of the Hungarian delegation; Comrade Ho Chi Minh, head of the Vietnamese delegation; Comrade Kim Il-sung, head of the Korean delegation; Comrade Hoxha, head of the Albanian delegation; and Comrade Damba, head of the Mongolian delegation. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the participants.

Gomulka said in his speech that the achievements of the Soviet Union's socialist construction over the past 40 years are the gains of the entire international workers' movement and the common gains of all progressive mankind. He emphasized that Poland has benefited particularly from the October Revolution, and the Polish and Soviet people are united by the great tradition of common struggle. The ideas of the great Lenin illuminate Poland's path to socialism. Gomulka said that Poland's many achievements are due to the assistance of the Soviet Union. We will continue to strengthen the friendship between the two countries.

Novotny said in his speech that the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic was the result of the Great October Revolution. Friendship with the Soviet Union firmly guarantees the sovereignty and independence of Czechoslovakia. Our people will never deviate from, and will strive to develop, the great and lofty ideas of the October Revolution.

Ulbricht said that the historical achievements of the Soviet Union over the past 40 years and the existence of the Soviet Union make us deeply grateful to the Soviet people. He emphasized that the heroic struggle of the Soviet people liberated the German people from the barbaric rule of the Nazis. The actual balance of power shows that the German question can only be resolved peacefully through the establishment of a German confederation. He pointed out that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in the decisive aspects of science and technology, and the 20th century is a century of struggle for lasting peace and socialism throughout the world.

Stoica pointed out in his speech that the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet Union on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution inspire all peace-loving and progressive people. The working people of the world today recognize that the path opened up by the October Revolution is the only path to national and social liberation. The achievements made by the Romanian people in recent years vividly demonstrate the correctness of the Leninist path taken by the people of socialist countries.

Zhivkov said that all peace-loving people in the world regard the Soviet Union as an insurmountable obstacle to the imperialist attempts to launch a new war. He emphasized that the friendship between the Bulgarian and Soviet people is deep-rooted and strong. For Bulgarians, Bulgarian-Soviet friendship is as important as sunshine and air are to life. The Bulgarian people will forever share their destiny with the socialist camp.

Kardelj said that the October Revolution was a turning point in human history. The Yugoslav people were greatly influenced by the October Revolution in their struggle for freedom and independence. Kardelj said that when celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Yugoslav people never forget that their achievements began with the days of the October Revolution, and the achievements of the Soviet people are their pillar. Today, we are building Soviet-Yugoslav friendly relations on the basis of friendship and unity. Kardelj also spoke about the desire of the various nationalities of Yugoslavia to strive for peace, for disarmament, and for expanding East-West ties.

Kadar, after pointing out the world historical significance of the October Revolution, said that as a representative of the Hungarian people, we can say that the Soviet Union's assistance to us in the autumn of 1956 was not in vain. Now the Hungarian People's Republic stands firmly, and the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, continue to actively build socialism in Hungary with a spirit of internationalism. The Hungarian people are unshakably loyal to the cause of socialism.

Ho Chi Minh said in his speech that the Soviet people have turned mankind's long-held fantasy of happiness into a solemn reality on one-sixth of the earth's land. The October Revolution has special significance for the nations of the East. The October Revolution set an example of national and social liberation for the oppressed people. Ho Chi Minh spoke about the unprecedented economic and cultural transformation that Vietnam has implemented under the people's democratic system. He emphasized that in the struggle of the Vietnamese people for a better future, the examples of the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp will become the guiding lights for the Vietnamese people.

Kim Il-sung said at the meeting that thanks to the assistance of various fraternal countries, the Korean people have made great achievements after the end of the war against the US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique. Now the Korean people are marching forward with full confidence along the road of peaceful reunification of the motherland and the victory of socialism. He emphasized that the imperialist conspiracies against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are doomed to failure. The Korean people are proud to have forged close ties of friendship with the Soviet people and to be in the socialist camp. He also said that our people are completely loyal to the banner of proletarian internationalism, and therefore will surely achieve the final victory in their just struggle.

Hoxha said at the meeting that the Great October inspired our people and gave them hope for liberation, and today's freedom was achieved through arduous struggle. Hoxha said that in the thirteen years of free life, the Albanian people have established their own industry, progressive agriculture, and people's cultural and educational undertakings. He said that the powerful Soviet Union has become a country where all peoples can see their own future. The socialist camp is most fortunate to have such a strong and loyal friend as the Soviet Union.

Damba emphasized in his speech that the Mongolian people were able to win freedom and national independence and establish their own people's country precisely as a result of the October Revolution and the liberation thought of the October Revolution. Damba said that Mongolian-Soviet friendship is a reliable guarantee for promoting the People's Republic of Mongolia towards socialism. The Mongolian people have infinite loyalty and sincere affection for the Soviet people, because the Soviet people have done everything possible for the prosperity of the Mongolian people. The Mongolian people are advancing with full confidence along the broad road of progress and socialism opened up by the October Revolution.

After the speeches by the heads of delegations from various countries, Lobanov, Chairman of the Soviet of the Union of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, delivered a reply thanking the delegations for their congratulations. On behalf of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the CPSU, and the Soviet people, he thanked everyone for the warm congratulations to the Soviet people on behalf of their own people. He said that the representatives of the Supreme Soviet were deeply moved by the speeches of Comrade Mao Zedong and other heads of delegations who expressed their greetings to the Soviet people on behalf of their own people.

Lobanov pointed out that the speeches of the leaders of delegations from various countries once again demonstrated the unity of the countries in the socialist camp.

Lobanov requested the foreign guests to convey the wishes of the Soviet people to the people of their own countries, wishing them happiness and prosperity, and wishing the friendship and cooperation between the people of all countries in the world to be constantly strengthened.

At the end of the meeting, the Soviet Supreme Soviet adopted a letter to the Soviet people and a letter to the working people, political and social activists, scientists and cultural figures, parliaments and governments of all countries in the world.

The letter to the Soviet people first warmly congratulated the Soviet people on the festival. Then, it described the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in all aspects over the past 40 years. It said that the October Revolution made labor the master of the country, and made working people the masters of their own motherland and the creators of their own happiness. The achievements we have made in the forty years of Soviet power are magnificent. We are now facing the task of realizing the great ideal of our era - communism. The Communist Party—the Soviet people's long-tested leader and the inspirer of all historical victories—is confidently leading the Soviet people toward communism. The letter to the Soviet people concluded by wishing the coming fifth decade of the Soviet state to be a decade of greater prosperity, and called on the working people to strive for greater victories in economic construction and cultural construction, and to strive for further improvement of the material life of the Soviet people!

The letter to the working people, political and social activists, scientists and cultural figures, parliaments and governments of all countries in the world expounded the Soviet Union's Leninist foreign policy of peace. The appeal in the letter pointed out that the people of all countries and the Soviet people need peace to build a brighter and better future. Socialist countries and many non-socialist countries, as well as the world peace movement, are actively striving for world peace. However, the Soviet Union's foreign policy of peace is often opposed by powerful groups in Western countries, especially the United States. At present, there is still a force in the world that is hindering the relaxation of tensions. The appeal said that peace must be guaranteed. Only by uniting all peace-loving forces, strengthening their organization and improving their activism, can peace be guaranteed.

The appeal said: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union calls on the people of all countries in the world, all workers and peasants, scientists and cultural figures, political and social activists, parliaments and governments: to unremittingly strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and for international cooperation; to strive for general disarmament and armies, and to ban atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons; to strive for an agreement on the immediate cessation of atomic weapon and hydrogen weapon tests, and to establish a collective security system in Europe and Asia; and to work hard to develop economic and cultural ties between countries and strengthen international trust. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union calls on all peace-loving people to actively carry out activities to prevent a new war and to keep the cause of peace in the hands of the people themselves.

At 8:30 pm (Moscow time), this grand event celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, this grand event marking the great unity of the forces of the people of all countries and the thriving development of the international socialist movement, solemnly declared its closing.
