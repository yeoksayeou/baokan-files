    Improving the Management System of Industry, Commerce, and Finance

    The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress approved on the 14th the three regulations passed by the State Council concerning the improvement of the management system of industry, commerce, and finance. The general spirit of these three regulations is to decentralize some of the powers of industrial, commercial, and financial management to local administrative organs and factory and mining enterprises, in order to further promote the initiative and enthusiasm of local areas and enterprises and to complete the unified national plan according to local conditions. This set of practices will surely have a positive and beneficial impact on our country's socialist construction. Our Party, the government, and all other aspects of our work must take this influence into account and adopt corresponding improvement measures to meet the needs of the vigorously developing socialist construction.

    The issue of centralization and decentralization has been debated in various historical stages of human society. Some emphasize centralism, while others emphasize local autonomy; feudal society debated this issue, and capitalist society also debated this issue. However, in class societies, whether it is centralism or local autonomy, it is the minority ruling class that holds power, while the majority of the working people have no power. The debate over centralization and decentralization in class societies actually reflects the conflicts of interest and mutual strife between various ruling groups, and is aimed at consolidating the rule of the minority ruling class over the majority of the working people. Socialist countries also have the issue of centralization and decentralization, but this is fundamentally different from the issue of centralization and decentralization in class societies. The issue of centralization and decentralization in socialist countries is actually the issue of democracy and centralism, the issue of how to better serve the people. Emphasizing only centralization without emphasizing democracy easily leads to detachment from the masses and reality, resulting in bureaucracy; emphasizing only democracy without emphasizing centralization will lead to extreme democratization, easily developing departmentalism, one-sidedness, and creating a phenomenon of freedom, looseness, indiscipline, and disorder. Therefore, the solution to the issue of centralization and decentralization in socialist countries is to better implement democratic centralism, to centralize on the basis of democracy, and to promote democracy under the guidance of centralism.

    For the past eight years, our country has been following the principles of Marxism-Leninism to solve the issue of centralization and decentralization. The implementation of democratic centralism is explicitly stipulated in the Common Program at the beginning of the founding of the country and in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. It should be said that this system has been generally observed by the central and local authorities. Many important laws and regulations have been widely discussed by government organizations at all levels and even by the people across the country in advance. The drafting of the Constitution is one example. The people across the country discussed the draft Constitution and put forward more than 100,000 suggestions before a relatively complete Constitution was formulated. The policy of agricultural cooperativization is another example. Chairman Mao's report on the issue of agricultural cooperativization was first distributed for discussion, then collected and discussed again before it was published. At the same time, in the process of "from the masses, to the masses," the central authorities always emphasized that all localities should act according to the specific conditions of the time and place, and resolutely opposed subjectivism of not studying the specific conditions and mechanically copying. The localities have been firm and creative in implementing the central policies and guidelines in light of their local conditions. Many of the central government's instructions are based on the experiences created by the localities. For example, the use of the method of joint state-private ownership of the entire industry to carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce was an experience created by the localities based on the central government's policies, and then promoted throughout the country. Thanks to the implementation of democratic centralism over the past eight years, the relationship between the central and local authorities has been normal and healthy.

    However, it should also be admitted that in the past few years, industrial, commercial, and financial management have been relatively centralized. This relatively high degree of centralization was correct at the time and was in line with the social conditions and work tasks at the time. For example, in the early days of liberation, we took over the mess left by the old society, with chaotic finances and rising prices; to unify finances and stabilize prices, it was obviously impossible for localities to act on their own, which required a relatively high degree of centralization. The compilation of the first Five-Year Plan and the beginning of planned economic construction required the concentrated use of limited financial, material, and human resources, and required consideration of the development of various sectors of the national economy from the perspective of national balance, which obviously also required a relatively high degree of centralization. It can be seen that the relatively high degree of centralization in industrial, commercial, and financial management in the past few years was necessary and correct from today's perspective; only a part of it is now considered unnecessary or has shortcomings. For example, many specialized companies in the commercial sector used to set up outlets universally, regardless of the different business volumes in different places, "supporting to the end," which was obviously unnecessary. Enterprise regulations once stipulated that factory and mining enterprises should apply to the competent authorities for approval for the purchase of fixed assets exceeding 200 yuan, following the basic construction investment procedures, which also had shortcomings. Although it is necessary to control the expenses of enterprises, enterprises vary in size. For small enterprises, 200 yuan can solve the problem very well, with almost no constraints; for large enterprises, 200 yuan cannot solve any problem, making it almost impossible to move forward. These inevitably limit the initiative of localities and enterprises and are not conducive to socialist construction.

    Our country is a large country, with different natural conditions and different economic foundations in different regions. It is difficult to force uniformity on many things; even some things that are considered most in need of centralization require adapting to local conditions and giving localities certain flexibility. For example, the national economic plan is the most in need of centralization. The Five-Year Plan and the annual plan need to be determined by the central government. However, when determining the Five-Year Plan and the annual plan, the central government can only first issue control figures from top to bottom, and then the draft plan is prepared from bottom to top, and after repeated revisions, it can be finally determined. Moreover, the plan cannot be set in stone; if it is set in stone, it will be difficult to be realistic and difficult to implement. Therefore, even the most centralized plan can only produce a general outline and major projects; and the small parts can only be determined by the localities according to their own conditions. If the plan is like this, what about other things? It can be seen that it is not feasible for the central government to manage everything, regardless of size. Such "centralization" appears to be centralized, but it is actually not conducive to centralization. In order to effectively centralize, it is necessary to decentralize some powers to the localities; this decentralization of power may seem to weaken centralization on the surface, but it actually strengthens centralization.

    It must also be pointed out that after eight years of effort, our country's economic situation has undergone some changes, and these changes also require appropriate decentralization of power. For example, with the commissioning of a large number of new enterprises and the completion of the expansion and reconstruction of old enterprises, the number of enterprises under the jurisdiction of the central industrial ministries has greatly increased. Continuing to use the old organizational and management forms makes it actually difficult to achieve concrete leadership for each enterprise. For example, due to the economic development of various regions, especially the emergence of some new industrial zones, localities also need more power to arrange the economic life of their regions and regulate the mutual relations of enterprises under the central ministries in their regions. Continuing to use the old organizational and management forms makes it difficult to adapt to the new situation of economic work. Therefore, in the past two years, how to appropriately decentralize some of the powers of industrial, commercial, and financial management to local administrative organs has become an issue that everyone feels needs to be resolved. The State Council has successively issued some regulations, giving localities more flexibility; but because this is a very large and far-reaching issue, it has not been possible to make systematic considerations from the perspective of the system in a short period of time. Now, after a long period of careful study, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has approved the three regulations on improving the management system passed by the State Council, making appropriate adjustments to the powers of the central and local authorities in industrial, commercial, and financial management from the perspective of the system, which is completely necessary.

    Decentralization of power is one aspect of the matter; another aspect of the matter, which can be said to be even more important, is the decentralization of responsibility. Power and responsibility are always linked together. After the improvement of the industrial, commercial, and financial management system, the power of local administrative organs has been expanded, and the power of the responsible persons of factory and mining enterprises has also been expanded, but at the same time, it should be seen that the local administrative organs and the responsible persons of factory and mining enterprises have also increased their responsibilities due to the improvement of the management system. For them, some things that could be decided by the higher authorities in the past now have to be decided by themselves. They must be conscientious, study hard, and take on the responsibilities cheerfully and competently, and carry out the work better than in the past. At the same time, it should also be seen that while decentralizing powers, it is necessary to further strengthen the work of comprehensive balance. The relevant comprehensive departments, planning departments, and central business departments must adapt to the changes in the management system, improve their leadership methods and business focus, and focus on the work of comprehensive balance and the guidance of relevant principles and policies, so that localities can decide issues according to local conditions within a certain range without affecting the overall and comprehensive balance. Don't think that after decentralizing powers, the relevant competent departments of the central government can completely let go. On the other hand, local responsible comrades and enterprise managers should also pay more attention to starting from the overall situation, taking care of the overall situation, and paying attention to overcoming the possible departmentalist emotions and local viewpoints, so as not to weaken the socialist planned economy. Our country is a socialist country, our construction is planned construction, and our plan is based on comprehensive balance; without the overall and comprehensive balance, it is not a planned economy, which will cause great waste. For example, after the decentralization of powers, all localities will inevitably develop economically and will inevitably set up some industries. At this time, it is necessary to consider not making the existing production equipment in other regions, especially coastal cities, idle. It is wrong to only take care of the coastal cities and not the inland areas, so that ordinary daily necessities such as thermos bottles must also be concentrated in the coastal areas for production and transported to the inland areas over long distances; but it is also wrong for the inland areas to demand self-sufficiency in everything and reject foreign products, which will inevitably cause waste of existing equipment.

    Are the three regulations on improving the management system passed by the State Council completely perfect and will not need to be improved in the future? No. For example, the regulations on improving the financial management system state that because it has just started to be implemented, all aspects have no experience, and preparations are being made to make partial adjustments when necessary one year after implementation. We say that the State Council is very cautious in formulating these three regulations on improving the management system. Since Chairman Mao raised the issue of the relationship between the central and local authorities in his report on "Mobilizing All Forces to Serve Socialism" last year, a series of meetings have been held, and localities have been organized to conduct many discussions. The Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee also specifically studied it not long ago. It took more than a year from beginning to end before it was finalized. Therefore, this improvement is completely correct from the current perspective.

    Since the launch of the nationwide rectification campaign, many comrades have already felt in their actual work that a new upsurge in production is rushing forward with the force of thousands of troops and horses. In the countryside, a great debate on two roads is unfolding, further strengthening the confidence of the vast number of peasants in taking the road of cooperation. The revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program published by the CPC Central Committee has also inspired the vast number of peasants to have greater production enthusiasm. In factories and mining enterprises, the upsurge of airing views and rectification has already appeared, with tens of thousands of opinions being raised, and many improvements have been made in the work, and the face of production has been renewed. On a national scale, going to the countryside, going to labor, going to the grassroots, and going to the most difficult places have become an inspiring slogan, and millions of cadres have already been lightly packed and sent down, or are preparing to set off. A new upsurge in socialist production is indeed taking shape day by day. Under such circumstances, the improvement of the industrial, commercial, and financial management system undoubtedly provides great assistance to the localities in welcoming the upsurge in production and organizing the upsurge in production. Some local Party organizations and government organizations have experience in this area, while others lack experience in this area, which requires immediate action to seriously study the economic situation in their region and correctly use the decentralized powers in order to organize the broad masses to complete the state's unified socialist construction plan better and in accordance with local conditions.

### 改进工业、商业和财政的管理体制

    改进工业、商业和财政的管理体制
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会14日批准了国务院通过的关于改进工业管理、商业管理和财政管理体制的三个规定。这三个规定的总的精神，是把一部分工业管理、商业管理和财政管理的权力，下放给地方行政机关和厂矿企业单位，以便进一步发挥地方的、企业的主动性和积极性，因地制宜地完成国家的统一计划。这一套做法必将对我国的社会主义建设产生积极的良好的影响。我们党的、政府的和其他各方面的工作，都必须估计到这种影响，采取相应的改进步骤，以适应蓬勃发展的社会主义建设的需要。
    集权和分权的问题，在人类社会的各个历史阶段都曾有过争论。有的强调中央集权，有的强调地方分权；封建社会争论过这个问题，资本主义社会也争论过这个问题。但是在阶级社会里，不管是中央集权也好，是地方分权也好，都是少数统治阶级掌权，大多数劳动人民无权。阶级社会里集权和分权的争论，实际上是反映了各个统治集团之间的利害冲突和互相倾轧，是为了巩固少数统治阶级对大多数劳动人民的统治。社会主义国家也有集权和分权的问题，但是这就根本不同于阶级社会里的集权和分权的问题。社会主义国家的集权和分权的问题，实际上就是民主和集中的问题，是怎样更好地为人民服务的问题。只强调集中，不强调民主，容易脱离群众，脱离实际，造成官僚主义；只强调民主，不强调集中，就会带来极端民主化，容易发展本位主义，片面性，造成自由散漫、无纪律、无秩序的现象。因此，社会主义国家解决集权和分权的问题，也就是更好地贯彻民主集中制，在民主的基础上集中，在集中指导下发扬民主的问题。
    八年来，我们的国家正是遵循马克思列宁主义的原则，来解决集权和分权的问题的。实行民主集中制，在建国之初的共同纲领上、在中华人民共和国宪法上，都有明文规定。应该说，这个制度是被中央和地方普遍遵守了的。许多重要的法令，事先更曾经过各级政府组织，甚至全国人民广泛讨论。宪法的制定是一个例子。全国人民讨论了宪法草案，提出了十多万条意见，才订出了一个比较完善的宪法。农业合作化的政策也是一个例子。毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告，是先发下去讨论，然后又收回来讨论才公布的。同时，在从群众中来，到群众中去的时候，中央总是强调各地要根据当时当地的具体情况，因地制宜因时制宜，总是坚决反对不研究具体情况，生搬硬套的主观主义的。地方在结合当地具体情况执行中央的政策方针上，也是坚决的、有创造性的。中央的许多指示，都是以各地创造的经验为根据的。例如用全行业公私合营的办法，对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，就是地方上根据中央的政策创造的经验，然后再在全国推行的。八年来由于民主集中制的贯彻，中央和地方的关系一直是正常的、健康的。
    但是，也应该承认，过去几年在工业管理、商业管理和财政管理上，比较起来，集中是比较多的。这种比较多的集中，在当时是正确的，是同当时的社会情况和工作任务相适应的。例如在解放初期，我们接收了旧社会留下的烂摊子，财政金融混乱，物价上涨；要统一财政、稳定物价，显然不是地方各行其是所能解决的，这就需要比较多的集中。编制第一个五年计划，开始有计划的经济建设，需要集中使用有限的财力、物力、人力，需要从全国范围的平衡来考虑国民经济各个部门的发展，这显然也是需要比较多的集中的。由此可见，过去几年工业管理、商业管理和财政管理上集中比较多些，是必要的，从现在看来也是正确的；只是其中有一部分，现在看来是不必要的，或者是有缺点的。例如商业方面许多专业公司，曾经不根据各地业务量大小的不同，普遍布点，“一杆子撑到底”，显然是不必要的。企业方面曾经规定，厂矿单位在固定资产购置方面用款超过二百元以上的，都要按照基本建设投资程序，呈请主管部门批准，也是有缺点的。因为控制企业的开支虽然必要，但企业有大小不同。对小企业说来，二百元很能解决问题，几乎没有什么约束；对大企业说来，二百元就不能解决什么问题，几乎寸步难行。这些不免会限制地方的和企业的积极性，不利于社会主义建设。
    我们国家是一个大国，各地的自然情况不同，经济基础也不同，许多事情是很难强求一致的；即便是一些被公认为最需要集中的事情，也需要因地制宜、需要给地方一定的机动权力。例如国家的经济计划，这是最需要集中的。五年计划、年度计划都需要由中央来确定。但中央在确定五年计划和年度计划的时候，也只能先由上而下地颁发控制数字，然后由下而上地编制计划草案，经过反复修订，才能最后确定下来。而且计划也不能订死了，如果都订死了，那就很难切合实际，也很难办事。因此，就是最需要集中的计划，也只能搞出个大轮廓、大项目；而细小的部分只能让地方因地制宜地去确定。计划尚且如此，更何况其他？可见，事不分大小都由中央来管是不行的。这样的“集中”，看来是集中了，实际上是不利于集中的。为了有效地集中，必须把一部分权力下放给地方；这种权力下放，表面看来是削弱了集中，实际上恰恰是加强了集中。
    还必须指出的是，经过八年来的努力，我国的经济情况已经有了若干变化，这种变化也要求适当地下放权力。例如大批新企业投入生产，旧企业扩建改建完成，中央各个工业部所辖企业的数目大大增加，继续沿用旧的组织管理的形式，实际上已经很难对每个企业实现具体领导。又例如由于各地经济的发展，特别是由于一些新工业区的出现，地方上也需要有比较多的权力来安排本地区的经济生活，调节中央各部所属企业在本地区的相互关系，继续沿用旧的组织管理形式，也很难适应经济工作的新的形势。因而近两年来，如何适当地把一部分工业管理、商业管理和财政管理的权力下放给地方行政机关，已成为大家都感到需要解决的问题。国务院曾经陆续有过一些规定，给地方增加了一些机动权力；但是由于这是很大的、牵涉很广的问题，短时间内还没有可能从体制上作系统的考虑。现在经过较长时间慎重的研究，全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准了国务院通过的改进管理体制的三个规定，从体制上对中央和地方在工业管理、商业管理和财政管理上的权力作了适当的调整，是完全必要的。
    权力下放，是事情的一个方面；事情的另一个方面，也可以说是更重要的一个方面是责任下放。权力和责任总是联系在一起的。工业管理、商业管理和财政管理的体制改进后，地方行政机关的权力扩大了，厂矿企业主管人员的权力也扩大了，但同时应当看到，地方行政机关和厂矿企业主管人员由于管理体制的改进，所负的责任也加重了。在他们来说，过去一些可以由上级决定的事，现在要由自己来决定了。必须兢兢业业，认真学习，胜任愉快地把责任担当起来，把工作进行得比过去更好。同时，还应当看到，在职权下放的同时，必须更加加强综合平衡的工作。有关的综合部门、计划部门和中央各业务主管部门必须适应管理体制的改变，改进自己的领导方法和业务重点，着重综合平衡工作和有关方针政策的指导，使地方能够在一定的范围内，因地制宜决定问题，而又不至影响整体和全面的平衡。不要以为权力下放了，中央有关的主管部门就可以完全撒手不管了。另方面，地方负责同志和企业主管人员也应当更多地注意处处从整体出发，照顾全局，注意克服可能出现的本位主义情绪和局部观点，以免削弱社会主义计划经济。我们的国家是社会主义的国家，我们的建设是有计划的建设，我们的计划是建立在综合平衡的基础上的；没有全局的、整体的平衡，就不是有计划的经济，就会造成很大的浪费。例如权力下放之后，各地在经济上必然有所发展，必然会兴办一些工业，这时候就需要考虑不使其他地区、特别是沿海城市已有的生产设备闲置起来。只顾沿海城市，不顾内地，以致热水瓶等普通的日常生活用品也要集中在沿海生产，远程运到内地，是不对的；但内地样样都要求自给自足，排斥外来的产品，必然造成已有设备的浪费，也是不对的。
    国务院通过的工业、商业和财政三个改进管理体制的规定，是不是十分完善，将来不需要再作改进了呢？不是的。比如改进财政管理体制的规定中就说到，由于刚开始实行，各方面都无经验，准备在实行一年以后，必要的时候再作局部调整。我们说，国务院制定这三个改进管理体制的规定，是十分慎重的。自从毛主席去年在关于“调动一切力量为社会主义服务”的报告中提出中央和地方的关系这个问题后，曾经开过一系列的会议，组织各地进行过多次讨论，不久前党的三中全会也专门作了研究，前后费时一年多，才定下来。因此，这个改进，从现在看来是完全正确的。
    全民整风开展以来，许多同志已经在实际工作中感觉到一个新的生产高潮正以千军万马之势奔向前来。农村里，展开着两条道路的大辩论，更坚定了广大农民走合作化道路的信心，中共中央发表的全国农业发展纲要修正草案，又鼓舞起广大农民更大的生产热情。厂矿企业里，鸣放的高潮和整改的高潮已经出现，千万条意见提上来，许许多多的工作已有改进，生产面貌焕然一新。在全国范围内，到农村去、到劳动中去、到层基去、到最艰苦的地方去，已成为一个振奋人心的口号，数以百万计的干部已经轻装下放，或者正整装待发。一个社会主义生产的新的高潮，确实在日益形成中。在这种情况下，改进工业管理、商业管理和财政管理的体制，无疑给了地方迎接生产高潮、组织生产高潮以很大的助力。地方的党组织和政府组织，有的是有这方面的经验的，有的还缺乏这方面的经验，这就需要立即行动起来，认真研究本地区的经济情况，正确地运用下放的权利，以便组织广大群众因地制宜地、更好地完成国家统一的社会主义建设计划。
