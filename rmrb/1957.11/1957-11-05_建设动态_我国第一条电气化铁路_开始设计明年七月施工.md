    China's First Electrified Railway
    Begins Design, Construction Planned for July Next Year
    China's first electrified railway, the Baoji to Fengxian section, with a total length of 91 kilometers (there are only a little over 1,000 kilometers of this type of electrified railway in the entire world), has begun design based on the industrial frequency 25,000-volt high-voltage AC electrified railway system.
    It is expected that all design work will be completed by March 1959, construction will begin in July next year, and the majority of the electrified railway project will be completed by the end of 1959.
    The railway from Baoji to Fengxian is 91 kilometers long and is a section of the trunk line connecting North China, Southwest China, and Northwest China.

    我国第一条电气化铁路
    开始设计明年七月施工
    我国第一条全长九十一公里的电气化铁路——宝鸡到凤县段铁路（这种电气化铁路目前全世界一共只有一千多公里），已经开始按工业频率二万五千伏高电压交流制电气化铁路进行设计。
    预计全部设计要进行到1959年3月，明年7月起准备施工，1959年年底这段电气化铁路工程大部分可以完成。
    宝鸡到凤县的铁路全长九十一公里，是沟通华北、西南和西北三个地区的一段干线。
