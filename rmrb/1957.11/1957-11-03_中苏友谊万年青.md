    Evergreen of Sino-Soviet Friendship
    Kyoto Opera Actor Dù Jìnfāng
    I have just returned from the Soviet Union not long ago, bringing back the sincere feelings and great friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. On the eve of this glorious festival, how can I not speak my mind!
    In July of this year, I had the honor of arriving in Moscow as a member of the preparatory committee for the 6th World Youth and Student Festival and as a young actor. During the month-long activities, there were so many touching things we saw and heard; the bright bouquets on every street, the lights shining from every window, the red flags fluttering in the wind on every rooftop, and the smiles on everyone's face, all shone with the light of friendship and peace. Whether workers, farmers, whether long-bearded old grandfathers, kind old mothers, mothers holding babies, or thousands upon thousands of Young Pioneers, they all passionately embraced, kissed, shook hands, and exchanged gifts to express their fiery enthusiasm for the Chinese people.
    Originally, our Chinese Youth Delegation was very nervous on the way from Ordzonikidze to Moscow. Because we are all actors, we all wanted to bring the friendship of the people of our motherland to the Soviet people and the youth of the world through our performances. But we are just young actors, compared to world-renowned artists, we are just novices. Especially since I had boldly signed up for three competition programs, I was even more nervous, fearing that there would be some mistakes in the performance, failing the trust of the motherland. But the enthusiasm of the Soviet people dispelled my concerns. When the train stopped at a station, among the crowd welcoming us stood a Soviet old mother, who silently stared at the faces of each of us. Our girls and young men crowded around her. The old mother stroked the hair of a Chinese young man and said to us: "I want to see the Chinese children. My husband and son sacrificed themselves in 1945 when liberating Manchuria. Seeing you is like seeing my own sons." When we hugged each other, we pointed to ourselves and said to her: "Mom! Look! How many Chinese sons and daughters you have!" The old mother smiled and said: "The day I have been waiting for has finally arrived. Children! You have come to the land where your mother lives!" Yes, our dear Soviet mother was right. From the passion and attachment on our faces at that time, she saw that her Chinese sons and daughters also had the same feelings!
    In Moscow, we often encountered old mothers rushing to embrace and kiss us as soon as we went out. Once I went to the bathhouse and met an old mother. We looked at each other face to face for a long time, and because we couldn't speak each other's language, we were anxiously searching for a common language to express our feelings for each other. I was thinking, let me call her mom! But before I could call out, she had already pointed to herself repeatedly and hurried to say: "Mom! Mom!" A surge of indescribable warmth poured into my heart. Mom hugged me tightly for a long time. The memories of childhood life were already faint, but this time I intimately enjoyed the comfort and warmth of an infant in the arms of a loving mother. I was thinking at the time: I don't need to be nervous about participating in the program competition anymore. I have not only stepped into my mother's land, but also live in my mother's house, sleeping in my mother's arms. I can let my brothers, sisters, and young friends appreciate and evaluate my performance in my mother's home, and I have no worries or concerns. I am a young actor trained by the Party. I was able to win two gold medals and one silver medal in the performance competition of the 6th World Youth Festival, which also contains much of the Soviet mother's love and encouragement!
    I will never forget the Soviet young friends' care and consideration for us. For us, they sacrificed their summer vacation to serve; for us, they worked more than ten hours a day; for us, they learned to cook Chinese food and make Chinese tea day and night; for us, they did not go to sleep until late at night. Doctors worked diligently to protect us, ensuring the actors' pleasant performances; college students checked their work late at night because a dish was not palatable; the translator girl called us repeatedly when she was sick to care for us; the director and photographer worked overtime until late at night to film my performance of "Chang'e Flying to the Moon"—well, although it was only a little over a month, I can't tell all the touching things at once. Although this is only a bit of the great friendship of the Soviet people, it shows the brotherly friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people and their great contribution to peace.
    May the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union last forever!

    中苏友谊万年青
    京剧演员　杜近芳
    我才由苏联回来不久，带回来苏联人民对中国人民真挚的情意和伟大的友谊。在这光辉节日的前夕，怎能不一吐为快呢！
    今年7月，我荣幸地以第六届世界青年与学生联欢节筹备委员及一个青年演员的名义到达了莫斯科。在为时一个多月的活动中，我们所看到和听到的动人的事情实在是太多了；每条街上的鲜艳的花束，每个窗口里透出的灯光，每幢屋顶上迎风招展着的红旗和每个人脸上浮着的微笑，都闪耀着友谊与和平的光采。无论是工人、农民，无论是长胡子的老爷爷、慈祥的老妈妈以及抱着婴儿的母亲和成千成万的红领巾们都激情地拥抱、亲吻、握手和用互换礼物等等来表示他们对于中国人民火炽的热情。
    本来我们中国青年代表团从奥德堡到莫斯科的途中，大家心里都很紧张。因为我们都是演员，都想把祖国人民的友谊通过自己的演出带给苏联人民与全世界的青年们。但我们都是些青年演员，和世界知名艺术家相比，我们只不过是个幼稚生。特别是我自己已经大胆地报了三个参加比赛的节目，心情就更为紧张，惟恐在演出中有些差错，有负于祖国的委托。但是苏联人民的热情把我的顾虑打消了。列车经过一个车站停了下来，在欢迎我们的人丛中伫立着一位苏联老妈妈，她老人家默默无言地注视着我们每一个人的面孔。我们姑娘们和小伙子们拥了上去。老妈妈抚摩着我们一个中国小伙子的头发向我们说：“我要看看中国的孩子们。我的丈夫和儿子在1945年解放满洲里的时候牺牲了，看到了你们就如同看到了自己的儿子一样”。在我们互相拥抱的时候，我们指着自己向她老人家说：“妈妈！您看！您的中国儿女有多少啊！”老妈妈笑了，她说：“我盼望的日子终于来到了。孩子们！你们到了妈妈居住的国土上来了！”是的，我们亲爱的苏联妈妈说得不错，她从我们当时脸上的激情和依恋，看出了她的中国的儿女们也正有着同样的心情啊！
    在莫斯科时，我们一出门，经常遇到老妈妈们赶来和我们拥抱亲吻。有一次我到浴室去，碰见了一位老妈妈。我们面对面地看了好半天，由于言语不通，都在焦急地搜寻着共同语言以表达出彼此的情意。我在想，我快些叫她老人家一声妈妈吧！但，当我还来不及叫出时，她已经连续用手指着自己并赶忙地说：“妈妈！妈妈！”一阵说不出的温暖涌进了我的心里。妈妈紧紧地拥抱了我很久。对于儿时的生活的回忆本来已经很淡了，这一次我又亲切地享受到一个幼儿在慈母怀抱时的安适和温暖。我当时想着：我用不着再为着参加节目比赛而紧张了。我不仅踏进了妈妈的国土，而且居住在妈妈的家里，睡在妈妈的怀里了。我能在妈妈的家里，让兄弟姊妹们和青年朋友们来欣赏和品评我的表演，我是无所顾虑和担心的。我是党培养出来的一个青年演员，我能在第六届世界青年联欢节表演比赛中获得了两个金质奖和一个银质奖，这里面又蕴蓄着多少苏联妈妈的慈爱和鼓励啊！
    我永不会忘记苏联青年朋友们对我们的百般照顾和体贴。为了我们，他们牺牲了暑假来服务；为了我们，他们每天要工作十几小时；为了我们，他们日夜都在学着烧中国菜、泡中国茶；为了我们，他们直到深夜还不肯安睡。医生们勤劳地防护着我们，保证了演员愉快地演出；大学生们为了一个菜作得不可口，深夜还在检查工作；翻译姑娘生了病还屡次打电话来关照我们；导演和摄影师们为了拍摄我演的
  “奔月”加班到深夜——好了，虽然仅仅只有一个多月的时间，但感人的事情我一时哪里述说得齐全。虽然这仅仅是苏联人民伟大友谊的一星半点，但却表明了苏联人民和中国人民之间的兄弟般的情谊和他们对于和平的巨大贡献。
    愿中苏两国伟大的友谊万年长青！
