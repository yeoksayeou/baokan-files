    Summarize and Promote the Experience of Governing the Mang River
    Comrade Tan Zhenlin Gave Five Instructions: Comprehensive planning, comprehensive management, and concentrated management; comprehensive development, comprehensive utilization; relying on the masses, focusing on small-scale projects; conscientiously summarizing local experience, humbly learning from foreign experience; Party committee responsible, secretary taking action, the whole Party mobilized, persistent implementation
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 14th: The Henan Provincial Party Committee recently held a symposium of thirteen counties in northern Henan to summarize and promote the experience of Xinxiang Prefecture in governing the Mang River, and to study the planning for governing the Wei River. Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, participated in the symposium to listen to reports and gave important instructions. Wu Zhipu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, also made a concluding speech.
    
    After listening to the experience of governing the Mang River basin, Tan Zhenlin listened to detailed reports from the Xinxiang and Anyang Prefectural Committees of the Communist Party of China, as well as various counties in northern Henan. At the meeting, he first gave important instructions on how to use the experience of governing the Mang River to do a good job in the Wei River governance plan. He said that the experience of governing the Mang River lies not in specific projects and technologies, but in comprehensive planning, comprehensive management, and concentrated management; but in comprehensive development, comprehensive utilization, and close integration with current production, combining long-term interests with current interests; but in relying on mass-based, diverse, small-scale projects as the mainstay, supplemented by necessary medium-sized projects; but in conscientiously summarizing experience, humbly learning from the experience of various places, and promptly promoting experience; but in the Party committee being responsible, the secretary taking action, the whole Party being mobilized, and persistent implementation. Wei River governance should absorb these experiences. It should be a comprehensive plan covering the entire governance area, including deep mountains, shallow mountains, hills, plains, depressions, alkaline land, and sandy land; it should be a comprehensive governance involving closing mountains for afforestation, afforestation, planting forests, renovating terraced fields, digging water cellars and dry wells, building reservoirs and gully dams, digging ditches and canals, repairing platform fields, planting rice, and so on; when planning drainage projects, the issue of water use should be considered, and how to use the overall water resources of the Wei River basin to irrigate the land in this area.
    
    Tan Zhenlin further elaborated on the relationship between large and small projects. He said that if considering from both manpower and financial resources, large-scale projects are relatively economical; however, small-scale projects cover a wide area and take effect quickly. The biggest feature is that they are easily combined with current production, and the masses can do it with their own strength. Therefore, it is possible to have more and faster results. Large-scale projects are technically demanding and require large investments from the state, so it is impossible to have many or fast results. As for good and economical, compared with all investment, manpower, and material resources, large-scale projects seem to be economical; but from another perspective, that is, from the perspective of developing current production, because small-scale projects are both fast and numerous, they can quickly reduce disaster losses, so small-scale projects can be numerous, fast, good, and economical. At the same time, large-scale projects run by the state are carried out at specific points and cannot be diverse; while small-scale projects run by the masses are carried out over a wide area and can be diverse. Small-scale projects are run by the masses themselves, which is of great benefit to cooperatives. These projects belong to the cooperatives and are run by the members collectively. With public accumulation and capital construction, the cooperatives will be as solid as steel, and with these projects, production will rapidly increase, leading to a great leap forward in production. Large-scale projects are different; they are run by the state and are owned by the whole people. From this point of view, small-scale projects are the main ones, and relying on the masses is fundamental. This is the need and requirement of the masses. Focusing on small-scale projects does not exclude the necessity of large and medium-sized projects, because they are needed to play a backbone role. And large-scale projects themselves also need the cooperation of a large number of small-scale projects to exert their greater effect.
    
    Tan Zhenlin emphasized that experience comes from practice. Without practice, it is impossible to improve the theory. He said that in the short span of two years, we have accumulated a lot of experience, and these experiences have proved that water management should focus on storage, because the entire area north of the Huai River does not have enough water, and even if the water from the Yellow River is brought in, it will not be enough. Since there is not enough water, we cannot drain the water away and throw gold and silver into the sea. We must turn the idea of fearing and hating water into loving and thinking about water in order to give full play to the role of water. Tianjin Prefecture is the downstream area of dozens of rivers, and the water all flows into the sea through the Hai River, causing Tianjin to suffer from floods every year. The experience of Tianjin Prefecture is very good. They proposed the eight characters "adapt, restrict, utilize, transform," and as a result, they turned water hazards into water conservancy. After three years of hard work, they reversed the passive situation of digging rivers and repairing dikes in the spring every year, preventing floods in the summer, and providing disaster relief in the autumn. It has changed from a grain-deficient area to a grain-surplus area.
    
    Tan Zhenlin said that the close integration of water management with current production is the requirement of the masses. Grasping the combination of water management and production will better mobilize the masses and make the water conservancy movement persist for a long time. The enthusiasm of the masses will become higher and higher.
    
    Tan Zhenlin pointed out that the specific methods of governing the Mang River cannot be copied mechanically, but its basic experience has universal significance. Because they adopted the policy of comprehensive planning, comprehensive management; comprehensive development, and comprehensive utilization to govern the Mang River, the result was not only the construction of water conservancy. I calculated that fourteen of the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program were combined, that is: according to the economic conditions of the cooperatives and the local natural conditions, take various measures to increase production, gradually increase agricultural capital construction, and create conditions for consolidating the agricultural cooperative system and greatly increasing the output of food and other crops. The cooperative was consolidated, the grain output increased, and Meng County has exceeded the requirement of four hundred catties per mu. As for the townships and cooperatives that have reached and exceeded the requirement, there are even more; livestock farming has been developed (they mainly raise sheep, and attention should also be paid to the development of draught animals); measures to increase production and promote advanced experience have been implemented; raising pigs and sheep has been developed, and farm manure has been greatly increased; the area of multiple cropping has been expanded, changing three crops in two years to two crops in one year; high-yield crops have been planted, and rice has been replanted; soil improvement and water and soil conservation have been carried out; the area of cultivated land has been expanded; mountain production has been developed, afforestation and aquaculture have been developed, and so on.
    
    Tan Zhenlin said that because small-scale projects are numerous, the possibility of defective products exists. Do not be afraid. The responsibility of the leadership is to inspect and identify them, and to immediately remedy those that do not meet the requirements. The secretary taking action does not mean that the secretary is relying on moving every stone, but that the secretary is acting as a "commander." The so-called secretary does not mean just one person, but represents the entire Party. One person's ability is not much.
    
    Tan Zhenlin said that the experiences of Mang River and Lin County can basically solve the management of mountainous and hilly areas, and the transformation of plains, low-lying areas, sandy deserts, and saline-alkali lands. Henan also has very good experience in these areas. All these experiences must be summarized into a complete and systematic experience, implemented, and universally promoted. However, promoting experience is not easy. This work should be undertaken by the Party committee. There is a lot of work to be done this winter and next spring. Summarizing and promoting advanced experience, carrying out water conservancy campaigns, rectifying the style of work, rectifying the communes, and fighting against rightists are all to ensure the development of production. The current priority is to ensure the increase in wheat production. It should be noted that this year's wheat was planted against drought and grabbed, and if management is not strengthened, irrigation and fertilization are not carried out, there is a risk of reduced production. Therefore, attention should be paid to strengthening field management of wheat and striving for large-scale high yields.
    
    Tan Zhenlin said that the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program has been announced. Whether the forty articles can be realized depends on the area north of the Huai River, because the average yield per mu in this area is less than two hundred catties. This area has 500 million mu of land and 160 million people. If it does not meet the requirements of the program, the "four, five, eight" will become a problem. This time, the comrades in the northern Henan area proposed that this area is not only "four, five," but can also reach "six, eight." Of course, turning possibility into reality requires a lot of work. Our country has a large population and limited cultivated land, so the focus is on increasing the yield per unit area. We should do our best to make our country a high-yielding country in the world. This is possible. To achieve this goal, we must have water conservancy. With water, we also need fertilizer. The source of fertilizer is raising a large number of pigs. In the past, there was a shortage of feed. Jiyuan County used terraced fields to plant alfalfa, and plans to plant 100,000 mu of alfalfa to raise 400,000 pigs. Another method is to use river mud, which can be tested. In short, we must widely develop sources of fertilizer. With water and fertilizer, intensive cultivation, coupled with improved tools and other measures, agricultural production will surely make a great leap forward in the whole county, the whole prefecture, and the whole province.
    
    Finally, Tan Zhenlin called on everyone to learn from the experience of Hongan County, Hubei Province, for every cadre to go deep into production, grasp a typical example, take the lead in carrying out high-yield experimental fields, make up their minds, and make agricultural production leap forward in quantity. He said that increasing production is the core of the forty articles of the Agricultural Program, and it can drive other items. He hopes that the northern Henan area will create a model for fully realizing the forty articles.
    
    Wu Zhipu then spoke. After recalling the three stages of development of water conservancy work in Henan, he focused on explaining how to understand the central government's policies and Comrade Tan Zhenlin's instructions, pointing out the issues that should be paid attention to in adhering to and implementing this policy in the northern Henan region. Wu Zhipu said that Comrade Tan Zhenlin summarized the experience of governing the Mang River into five points. This is a fundamental solution to the problem. We should not regard it as a technical measure, but as a policy issue. Wu Zhipu asked the northern Henan region to make a leap forward in water conservancy construction and agricultural production this winter and next spring.
    
    The meeting was attended by the county Party secretaries and heads of water conservancy bureaus of Lin County, Anyang, Xinxiang, Jiyuan, and other counties, responsible comrades of the Xinxiang and Anyang prefectural committees and special offices, heads of water conservancy bureaus, and responsible comrades of relevant departments directly under the provincial government, totaling more than 40 people.

    全面规划　综合治理　依靠群众　兴修水利
    豫北十三县举行水利座谈会
    总结和推广治理漭河经验
    谭震林同志作了五点指示：全面规划，综合治理，集中治理；全面发展，综合利用；依靠群众，小型为主；认真总结本地经验，虚心学习外地经验；党委负责，书记动手，全党动员，坚持贯彻
    新华社郑州14日电　中共河南省委最近召开了豫北十三个县座谈会，总结和推广新乡专区治理漭河的经验，研究治理卫河的规划。中共中央书记处书记谭震林参加座谈会听取汇报，并作了重要的指示。省委书记处书记吴芝圃也作了总结性的发言。
    谭震林在听取了漭河流域治理经验以后，又听取了中共新乡、安阳两地委以及豫北各县的详细汇报。他在会上首先就如何运用治理漭河的经验，来做好卫河治理规划问题作了重要指示。他说，漭河治理经验，不在于具体的工程和技术，而在于全面规划、综合治理和集中治理；而在于全面发展，综合利用，密切结合当前生产，把长远利益和当前利益结合起来；而在于依靠群众性的、多样性的小型工程为主，辅之以必要的中型工程；而在于认真总结经验，虚心学习各地经验，及时推广经验；而在于党委负责，书记动手，全党动员，坚持贯彻。卫河治理应该吸收这方面的经验，应该是从深山、浅山、丘陵、平原、洼地、碱地、沙地全面的规划在治理范围内；应该是从封山育林、造林、植林，整修梯田，挖水窖、旱井，修水库、谷坊，挖沟洫，修台田，种水稻等等方面进行综合性的治理；在规划排水工程时，就应当想到用水的问题，如何把卫河流域全面水利资源，用于灌溉这个地区的土地。
    谭震林进一步论述了大型和小型工程的关系问题。他说，如果从人力财力两方面考虑，比较节约的是大型工程；但是，小型工程铺的面广，发生效力快，最大的特点是容易和当前生产结合，群众自己力量能够办得到，因此，就可能多和快。大型工程技术性高，国家投资大，因此就不可能多，也不可能快。至于好和省，同全部投资、人力、物力相比，大型工程好像是省；但从另一个意义上看，即从发展当前生产上看，由于小型工程既快又多，可以迅速减少灾害损失，这样小型工程就能是多、快、好、省。同时，国家举办的大型工程是在点上进行，不能多种多样；而群众兴办的小型工程是在广大的面上进行，可以多种多样。小型工程是依靠群众自己办，这对于合作社是有极大好处的。这些工程都是合作社的，为社员集体所办，社有了公共积累和基本建设，就会像钢铁般的巩固，而且有了这些工程，就会使产量迅速提高，出现增产的跃进。大型工程就不同，它是国家办的，是全民所有制。由此看来，小型工程是主要的，依靠群众是基本的，这是群众的需要和要求。以小型工程为主并不排除大型、中型工程的必要性，因为需要它起骨干作用。而大型工程本身也需要有大量小型工程的配合，才能发挥它更大的效果。
    谭震林强调指出，经验都是从实践中来的，没有实践，不可能把理论提高。他说在短短的两年中，我们积累了很多经验，这些经验都证明，治水应当以蓄为主，因为整个淮河以北地区水是不够，黄河的水拿来也不够用。既然水不够用，我们就不能把水排掉，把金子银子抛到海里去。我们要把怕水恨水的思想，变为爱水想水，才能发挥水的作用。天津专区是几十条河流的下游，水都集中到海河入海，造成天津地区年年受到水灾。天津专区经验很好，他们提出“适应、限制、利用、改造”八个大字的结果把水害变成了水利，苦战三年，扭转了年年春天挖河修堤、夏天防汛秋后救灾的被动局面，由缺粮区变成为余粮区。
    谭震林说，治水同当前生产密切结合是群众的要求，抓住治水和生产结合，就更能充分发动群众，就能把兴修水利运动长期的坚持下去，群众的情绪也就会愈来愈高。
    谭震林指出，治理漭河的具体办法不能生搬硬套，但其基本经验是有普遍意义的。由于他们采取了全面规划，综合治理；全面发展，综合利用的方针，来治理漭河，其结果就不光是兴修了水利，我算了一下，农业发展纲要四十条中就结合办了十四条，那就是：根据合作社的经济情况和当地的自然条件，采取各种增产措施，逐步地增加农业基本建设，为巩固农业合作化制度和大力提高粮食的产量和其他农作物的产量创造了条件，合作社巩固了，粮食产量增加了，孟县全县已经超过了四百斤的要求，至于乡、社达到和超过的就更多了；发展了牧畜业（他们主要是养羊，还应该注意发展耕畜）；推行了增产措施和推广先进经验；发展了养猪养羊，大力增加了农家肥料；扩大了复播面积，变两年三作为一年两作；多种高产作物，改种了水稻；进行了土壤改良和水土保持；扩大了耕地面积；发展了山区生产，植树造林和发展水产养殖业等等。
    谭震林说，小型工程因为它量多，出现废品的可能性是存在的，不要怕，领导的责任就是要检查鉴定，不合规定的要立即补救。书记动手，并不是说靠书记搬每一块石头，而是要书记作“统帅”。所谓书记，并不等于书记一个人，而是代表整个党，一个人的本事是不多的。
    谭震林说，漭河、林县的经验，可以基本上解决山区、丘陵地区的治理，平原地、低洼地、沙荒、盐碱地的改造，河南也都有了很好的经验。所有这些经验，要把它总结起来，成为完整系统的经验，贯彻下去，普遍推广。而推广经验并不是容易的事，这项工作要由党委担负起来。今冬明春工作很多，总结、推广先进经验，开展水利运动，还要整风、整社、反右派，所有这些都是为了保证生产的发展，当前首先是保证小麦增产。应该看到，今年小麦是抗旱抢种上的，如果不加强管理，灌溉、施肥，就有减产的危险，所以要注意加强小麦的田间管理，争取大面积丰产。
    谭震林说，农业发展纲要修正草案公布了，四十条能否实现，关键在于淮河以北地区，因为这个地区平均亩产不到二百斤，这个地区有五亿亩土地，一亿六千万人口，如果达不到纲要的要求，“四、五、八”就成了问题。这次豫北地区的同志们提出这个地区不仅是“四、五”，而且可以达到“六、八”。当然把可能性变为现实，还需要通过许许多多的工作。我们国家人口众多，耕地有限，所以重点是放在提高单位面积产量上，我们应该尽最大努力，使我国成为世界上的高产国，这是可能实现的。要达到这个目标，就必须水利化，有了水还要肥料，肥料来源是大量养猪，过去是饲料困难，济源县利用梯田种苜蓿，计划种十万亩苜蓿可养猪四十万头。再就是利用河泥，可以试验。总之，要广泛地开辟肥源。有水有肥，精耕细作，加上改良工具等其他措施，那么农业生产就一定会在全县、全专区和全省出现大跃进。
    最后，谭震林号召大家学习湖北省红安县的经验，每个干部都要深入生产，抓一个典型，带头搞丰产试验田，下定决心，使农业生产量来个跃进。他说，增产是农业纲要四十条的核心，它可以带动其他各项，希望豫北地区创造一个全面实现四十条的典型。
    吴芝圃接着发言。他在回忆了河南水利工作发展的三个阶段的情形以后，着重阐述了如何领会中央的方针政策和谭震林指示的精神，指出在豫北地区坚持贯彻执行这个方针应当注意的问题。吴芝圃说，谭震林同志把治理漭河的经验总结了五条，这是从根本上解决了问题，我们不能把它看成是个技术措施，而要看成是个方针问题。吴芝圃要求豫北地区在今冬明春来个兴修水利和农业增产的跃进。
    参加会议的有中共林县、安阳、新乡、济源等县县委书记和县水利局长，中共新乡、安阳地委和专署的负责同志、水利局长及省直属机关有关部门负责同志共四十多人。（附图片）
