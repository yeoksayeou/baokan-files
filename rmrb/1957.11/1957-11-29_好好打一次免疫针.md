    Give a Good Vaccination of Immunity
	Kong Sang

    The discussion of Lei Dagu's forgetful thoughts at the Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill and the discussion of Huang Rongbao's work for an underground factory at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant (see page 3 of yesterday's newspaper) raise some thought-provoking questions. One of the main ones is that it proves that it is necessary to carry out a large-scale socialist education among the ranks of the working class, and the worker comrades should consciously participate in this magnificent movement.

    The working class is the most determined force in safeguarding socialism, and the ideological qualities of the working class are the noblest and most selfless. The overall organizational and ideological situation of the working class in our country is also good. Then, why should socialist education be carried out among the working class? This is first of all because doing so can give them better weapons to carry out the struggle; at the same time, because a small number of them still have petty-bourgeois ideas and may accept the influence of the bourgeoisie. The examples of Lei Dagu and Huang Rongbao show that some individual workers have indeed been eroded by bourgeois ideology, and have therefore done some things that violate the morality of the working class and the interests of socialism.

    Of course, the actions of people like Lei Dagu and Huang Rongbao are only isolated cases in the ranks of the working class. However, some of their ideas are relatively common among some workers, especially new workers.

    There is such a small group of workers who complain about low wages and few benefits today, and complain about not wearing well and living well tomorrow; they are frivolous at work and pursue luxury and corruption in life. Being young and ignorant, without experiencing hardship, and not knowing thrift and frugality is the root cause of the illness of some people. However, some people are suffering from other diseases. Lei Dagu's idea is: "Now that I have money, I want to eat, dress, and enjoy myself like the ladies in the old society." Huang Rongbao examined himself and said: "I don't compare myself with the past, nor with the lives of the broad masses of working people today, but I compare myself with the bourgeoisie's life of pleasure, enjoyment and corruption. Although my salary income is high and my life is already very good, I still feel dissatisfied. In the past year or so, after I bought a new watch, radio, leather shoes, serge Zhongshan suit, tweed Zhongshan suit, etc., I even planned to rent a spacious house and buy furniture. So I felt that the money was not enough, so I used my brains to engage in underground factories, and I was not interested in the factory's production." Yes, that is where the root of the disease lies. This disease is called "being eroded by bourgeois ideology."

    It should be admitted that even among new workers, there are very few people who are willing to learn from capitalists from the beginning, to exploit others, and to engage in "five poisons." However, there are more people who admire the bourgeois way of life, are greedy for enjoyment, hate labor, and only care about themselves and disregard the whole. Bourgeois ideology often begins to erode us from here. If we do not be vigilant and overcome this in time, we will sink deeper and deeper. Lei Dagu and Huang Rongbao are not because they are wholeheartedly pursuing the bourgeois life of pleasure, enjoyment and corruption, so that they engage in things that undermine the foundations of socialism and violate the interests of the working class? We should find out the reasons for their downfall from the examples of these two people, find out which step they took wrong, and thus fall into the mud pit step by step. Further, we can learn lessons from this, prevent problems before they occur, and protect the pure body of the working class, so that bourgeois ideology has no room for activity in the ranks of the working class.

    Some new workers are unwilling to listen to the term ideological remolding. In fact, because they lack the edification of large-scale production and the exercise of class struggle, they lack the "immunity" to resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology, and some people even carry this germ themselves. It is necessary for everyone to have a good vaccination in the rectification movement to eliminate and resist bourgeois ideology, and it has more practical significance for new workers.

    好好打一次免疫针	孔桑
    武汉第一纱厂对雷大姑忘本思想的讨论和上海机床厂对黄荣宝为地下工厂干活的讨论（见本报昨日第三版），提出了一些发人深思的问题。其中主要的一个，就是证明了目前在工人阶级队伍中有必要进行一次大规模的社会主义教育，工人同志们应该自觉地参加这个波澜壮阔的运动。
    工人阶级是维护社会主义的最坚决的力量，工人阶级的思想品质是最高尚、最无私的。目前我国工人阶级的组织状况和思想状况，总的方面也是好的。那末，为什么还要在工人阶级当中进行社会主义教育呢？这首先是因为，这样做，可以使他们得到更好的武器去进行斗争；同时也因为在他们中间有一小部分人还带有小资产阶级的思想，还可能接受资产阶级的影响。雷大姑、黄荣宝的事例，就说明现在有个别工人的确已经受到了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，因而作出了一些违反工人阶级道德和社会主义利益的事情。
    当然，像雷大姑、黄荣宝的行径，在工人阶级队伍中仅是个别的。但是，他们的某些思想在一部分工人、特别是新工人中，却是比较普遍地存在着。
    有这样一小部分工人，他们今天嫌工资少，福利少，明天嫌穿的不好，住的不好；工作中吊儿浪当，生活上追求奢侈腐化。年幼无知，未经艰难困苦，不知勤俭节约，是一部分人的病根。但是，有些人却是患着另外的病症。雷大姑的思想是：“现在有钱了，要像旧社会的太太们那样，吃点、穿点，好好享受一下。”黄荣宝自己检讨说：“我不和过去的生活比，也不和今天广大劳动人民的生活比，我却和资产阶级享乐腐化的生活比。虽然我的工资收入很多、生活已经过得很好了，但是我还是感到不满足。这一年多来，我买了新手表、收音机、皮鞋、哔叽中山装、花呢中山装等等以后，我甚至还打算租一间宽敞的房子，添购家具。所以我就感到钱不够用了，就动脑筋去搞地下工厂，对厂里的生产也就没有劲了。”是呀，这就是病根所在。这个病就叫做“受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀”。
    应该承认，即使在新工人中，一开始就甘心想学资本家的样子，去剥削别人，搞“五毒”的人也是微乎其微的。但是，羡慕资产阶级的生活方式，贪图享受，厌恶劳动，只顾个人，不顾整体的人就比较多一些了。资产阶级思想往往就是从这儿开始侵蚀我们。这一点如不及时警惕，及时克服，就会越陷越深。雷大姑、黄荣宝不就是因为一心追求资产阶级享乐腐化的生活，以至搞起挖社会主义墙脚、违反工人阶级利益的事情来的吗？我们应该从这两个人的事例中，找出他们失足的原因，弄清他们是踩错了哪一脚，因而一步步陷到泥坑里去的。进一步便可以从这里吸取教训，防微杜渐，来保护工人阶级纯洁的肌体，使资产阶级思想在工人阶级队伍中没有活动的余地。
    有一部分新工人，不大愿意听思想改造这个词儿。实际上，因为缺乏大生产的陶冶和阶级斗争的锻炼，他们最缺乏抵抗资产阶级思想侵蚀的“免疫力”，有的人甚至自己就带着这种病菌。在整风运动中好好打一次清除和抵抗资产阶级思想的免疫针，对每一个人都是需要的，对于新工人来说，就具有更现实的意义。
