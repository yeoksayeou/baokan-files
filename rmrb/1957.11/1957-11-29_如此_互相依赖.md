So-Called “Interdependence” By our correspondent Pan Fei

A New Tune

The slogan "interdependence" has become the most fashionable thing in London. Macmillan put forward this slogan during his meeting in Washington; Eisenhower quickly accepted his suggestion. When the meeting ended, they wrote in a joint statement: "The countries of the free world are interdependent; security and progress can only be achieved by establishing a genuine partnership, uniting our strengths, and sharing tasks in many areas. For our part, we have agreed that our two countries will act according to this principle in the future."

Since the Washington meeting, Britain has spared no effort in promoting this slogan. Macmillan has spoken more than once about the necessity of "interdependence."

What exactly is "interdependence"? According to existing materials, it includes two aspects:

1. US-UK "cooperation" in the research and production of nuclear weapons, rockets, and missiles; and based on the US and UK, this "cooperation" will be extended to other countries.

2. Under the slogan of "interdependence," Western European countries are required to readjust their relations with the US and UK.

The two largest imperialist countries—the United States and Britain—are attempting to redistribute the power of the Western camp and arrange relations between Western countries based on such a "new" principle, in order to achieve their respective expected goals. However, in this Western world full of contradictions and infighting, it is hard to believe that even some degree of genuine cooperation can be achieved. When Macmillan put forward the slogan "interdependence" in Washington, Britain already had its own plans.

Turning Back and Trump Card

The Washington meeting was initiated by Britain. At that time, the success of the Soviet Union in manufacturing intercontinental missiles and launching artificial earth satellites had caused serious failures in the US foreign policy; at the same time, in the conspiracy of the United States to interfere in the Syrian people's affairs, the Eisenhower Doctrine (which for Britain, meant squeezing out British forces in the Middle East) was declared bankrupt. Britain had recovered from the blows suffered in the Suez War, restored its economy, contracted its front, eased the strained relationship between the Commonwealth countries and Britain, etc. Thus, a wonderful fantasy accompanied Macmillan from London to Washington; the days when Britain humbled itself before the United States at the Bermuda Conference were over, and now it might greatly raise its own status to force the United States to make concessions on certain issues. In other words, Britain, which had to make many concessions under the step-by-step pressure from the United States after the Suez War, now wanted to suddenly turn around and give Uncle Sam a "turning back."

However, Britain's estimation was not realistic. Because the failure of the US aggressive policy does not mean that it is Britain's victory. After Macmillan arrived in Washington, Eisenhower invited NATO Secretary-General Spaak to participate in the meeting. This was tantamount to telling Macmillan: the United States does not regard Britain as an equal partner, but only as a member of the NATO military bloc under the leadership of the United States. When Macmillan returned to London, triumphantly pretending that Britain had become the second leader in the capitalist world, Eisenhower deliberately cancelled his visit to Britain, giving a heavy blow to Britain, which was getting too big for its boots.

Thus, Macmillan's "turning back" was met with Eisenhower's "trump card."

Their Common Goals

These phenomena provide us with some clues to analyze the slogan "interdependence."

As a specific result of the Washington meeting, the US, Britain, and the entire NATO group will "cooperate" on the development of nuclear weapons, rockets, and missiles. It cannot be thought that the US and Britain have no common goals and intentions in this regard. They can find a "common language" in opposing socialist countries and colonial liberation movements, and in opposing peace-loving people all over the world.

First, whether it is the United States or Britain, they both hope to accelerate and expand the nuclear arms race under the slogan of "interdependence" in order to save the bankrupt "deterrence policy." This policy is not only the basis and core of US foreign policy, but also the basis and core of British foreign policy. They are doing their best to obstruct the relaxation of the international situation, because the emergence and strengthening of this trend means a decline in the profits of large monopoly groups and promotes the further development of neutralist tendencies.

Second, they both hope that after expanding the nuclear arms race, the economic crisis of capitalism can be postponed. As everyone knows, US industrial production has begun to decline sharply. The United States is trying to prevent the continued development of this trend, and Britain is equally afraid of the outbreak of an economic crisis in the United States, because this will inevitably have a serious impact on the British economy, which is closely linked to the US economy.

Third, they hope to find some form of "cooperation" under the slogan of "interdependence" to consolidate the monopoly position of the US and Britain in the production of nuclear weapons, and strive to prevent the emergence of more "atomic countries." They also attempt to use this to control the scientific and technological and material strength of other NATO countries, to serve their war plans, while shifting part of the burden of expanding armaments to other partners in NATO.

Fourth, they attempt to create a new "theoretical" foundation for NATO under the slogan of "interdependence," so that this disintegrating military bloc can be stabilized and turned into a base for launching rockets, missiles, and conducting nuclear wars. Back then, NATO was established under such a "theory": the Soviet Union would launch an "attack" on Western Europe, and Western European countries must "organize" themselves with the support of the United States to implement "collective self-defense"; in this fabricated war, the armies of Western European countries would make the first line of "resistance," followed by the United States, which had absolute "atomic superiority," using its huge "deterrent power" to give the imaginary enemy a devastating blow... But what happened in the years since the establishment of this military bloc? That is: the Soviet Union faithfully implemented its peaceful foreign policy, the idea of peaceful coexistence was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the US "atomic superiority" was also shattered. Therefore, this old "theory" is outdated and needs to be replaced by a new theory.

Differences Between the US and Britain

However, when it comes to specific issues, differences arise between the US and Britain, which claim to take the lead in "genuine cooperation" and implement "interdependence."

Britain reluctantly recognizes the US hegemonic position in nuclear armaments, but hopes to steadily sit in the second place and jointly monopolize the research and production of nuclear weapons with the United States. The Washington meeting seemed to have made a decision on this, announcing in principle the cooperation between the US and Britain in the research and development of nuclear weapons. The problem is that this "cooperation" has no foundation. Let's see: Britain has hydrogen bombs, and so does the United States; Britain is starting to study rockets, but has not yet started on the research of intercontinental missiles, while the United States is at least one step ahead of Britain. Why is it necessary for the United States to raise Britain's status a little? On the contrary, the United States intends to use this form of "cooperation" to obtain some readily available benefits, while restricting Britain's progress in the research and manufacture of nuclear weapons under the pretext of "division of labor." It is said that some US military personnel suggested that Britain only conduct research on hydrogen bombs, while the United States and others would carry out production, and then supply Britain with a certain number of nuclear weapons. To this end, Macmillan authorized the British representatives in the expert group of the two countries to insist that Britain must carry out the production of hydrogen bombs and missiles, no matter what suggestions the United States makes.

Under the slogan of "interdependence," Britain hopes to strengthen its ties with Western European countries, thereby raising its own status. But this is what the United States is unwilling to see. The United States is planning to equip West Germany with nuclear weapons, turning it into a nuclear strategic base under US control, in order to belittle Britain's position. In the Tunisia weapons supply incident, the problem became clearer: both the United States and Britain tried their best to squeeze out France's influence in North Africa, but in terms of US strategy, it also had the effect of using the relationship between Britain and its conspiracy to alienate British-French relations. Of course, Britain would not fail to take countermeasures. When France was furious, Macmillan hurriedly flew to Paris to hold British-French talks, attempting to mend the rift between the two countries and play a unique role in NATO.

"Have" Countries and "Have-Not" Countries

On the issue of nuclear weapons, not only are the United States and Britain full of contradictions. The two countries with nuclear weapons, the United States and Britain (especially the United States), are also full of contradictions with other countries without nuclear weapons.

At the NATO summit in December, the US and Britain will peddle its specific plan for "interdependence." According to the talks of Eisenhower and Dulles, according to the speeches of US representatives at the NATO Parliamentary Conference, and other reports, the US idea is roughly: First, to establish medium-range rocket bases in Britain and other NATO countries; Second, to establish storage of nuclear weapons (including rocket warheads) under US control in Western Europe; Third, to expand the existing training of "allied" personnel to handle atomic bombs and atomic rockets; Fourth, to reallocate the "defense tasks" of NATO members, determining the primary and secondary, with the United States as the center; Fifth, the "common use" of scientific talents and intelligence, and the United States is prepared to make some degree of modification to the McMahon Act; Sixth, the final decision-making power to use nuclear weapons rests in the hands of the United States.

The reaction of NATO member states to the US plan was greatly surprised. Because this plan does not reflect the spirit of "interdependence," but rather requires Western European countries to further submit to the United States. France, which is particularly sensitive to its "great power status," is dissatisfied with the pre-arrangements made by the US and Britain at the Washington meeting, imposing the plans they formulated on NATO countries. France is even more unwilling to be deprived of the "right" to manufacture nuclear weapons. West Germany, which aspires to dominate Western Europe, is also not happy to serve as a base for US nuclear weapons. The more realistic problem facing Western European countries is: how much national sovereignty will they be required to give up? How much more funds will be allocated to military spending? More importantly, what will be the result in a nuclear war provoked by the United States?

It can be seen that the proposal of the slogan "interdependence" does not mean the beginning of greater unity among capitalist countries; but precisely the beginning of sharper contradictions between them. (Attached picture)

### 如此“互相依赖”

    如此“互相依赖”	本报记者  潘非
    新调调
    “互相依赖”这个口号，目前在伦敦已经成为最时髦的东西。麦克米伦在华盛顿会谈中提出这个口号；艾森豪威尔很快接受了他的建议。当会谈结束时，他们在联合声明中写道：“自由世界各国是相互依赖的；只有建立真诚的合伙关系，把自己的力量联合起来并且在许多方面分担任务，那样才会有安全和进步。在我们这方面，我们已经一致商定今后我们两国将根据这一原则办事。”
    自从华盛顿会谈以后，英国不遗余力地鼓吹这个口号。麦克米伦不止一次地谈到“互相依赖”的必要性。
    究竟什么是“互相依赖”？从现有的材料来看，它包括两个方面：
    一、美英在核子武器、火箭和导弹的研究和生产上进行“合作”；并以美英两国为基础，把这种“合作”扩大到其他国家中去。
    二、在“互相依赖”的口号下，要求西欧国家重新调整它们同美英的关系。
    两个最大的帝国主义国家——美国和英国，企图依据这样一个“新”的原则，来重新调配西方阵营的力量，安排西方国家之间的关系，以达到它们各自所预期的目的。但是，在这个充满矛盾和倾轧的西方世界中，要想实行即使是某种程度上的真正的合作，也是难以令人相信的。当麦克米伦在华盛顿提出“互相依赖”这个口号时，英国就已经有了自己的打算。
    回马枪和杀手锏
    华盛顿会谈是英国主动提出来的。当时，苏联制造洲际导弹与放射人造地球卫星的成功，已使美国的对外政策遭到了严重的失败；与此同时，在美国干涉叙利亚人民的阴谋中，艾森豪威尔主义（这个主义对英国来说，就是要排挤不列颠在中东的势力）宣告了破产。而英国则已从苏伊士战争所遭受的打击中缓过气来，恢复了经济，收缩了阵脚，缓和了联邦国家同英国的紧张关系等等。于是，一个美妙的幻想伴随着麦克米伦从伦敦飞到了华盛顿；百慕大会谈时英国向美国低声下气的日子已经过去了，现在它可能大大抬高自己的地位，来迫使美国在若干问题上让步。换句话说，苏伊士战争后在美国的步步进逼下不得不作了许多退却的英国，现在想突然转过身来，给山姆大叔一个“回马枪”。
    可是，英国的估计并不现实。因为美国侵略政策的失败，并不意味着这是英国的胜利。当麦克米伦到达华盛顿以后，艾森豪威尔又邀请北大西洋公约组织秘书长斯巴克参加会谈。这等于告诉麦克米伦：美国并不把英国当作一个平等的伙伴，只不过把它看作是美国领导下的北大西洋军事集团中的一个成员。当麦克米伦回到伦敦，得意扬扬地装作英国已成为资本主义世界中第二号头目的时候，艾森豪威尔又故意取消了对英国的访问，对尾巴翘得很高的英国，狠狠地抽了一鞭子。
    这样，麦克米伦的“回马枪”，遭到了艾森豪威尔的“杀手锏”的还击。
    它们的共同目的
    这些现象，为我们提供了一些线索，来分析“互相依赖”这个口号。
    作为华盛顿会谈的具体结果，是美英以及整个北大西洋集团在发展核子武器、火箭和导弹问题上进行“合作”。不能认为，美英两国在这方面没有什么共同的目的和意图。在反对社会主义国家和殖民地解放运动的时候，在反对全世界爱好和平的人民的时候，它们可以找到“共同语言”。
    第一，不论是美国，或者是英国，它们都希望在“互相依赖”的口号下，加速和扩大核子军备竞赛，挽救已经破了产的“威慑政策”。这个政策不仅是美国对外政策的基础和核心，同样也是英国对外政策的基础和核心。它们都竭力阻挠国际局势的缓和，因为这种趋势的出现和加强，意味着大垄断集团利润的下降，并促使中立主义倾向的进一步发展。
    第二，它们都希望在扩大核子军备竞赛以后，资本主义的经济危机得以推迟。大家知道，美国的工业生产已经开始急剧下降。美国力图阻止这种趋势的继续发展，而英国也同样地害怕美国爆发经济危机，因为这势必使同美国经济联系十分密切的英国经济受到严重的影响。
    第三，它们希望在“互相依赖”的口号下找到某种“合作”的形式，来巩固资本主义世界中美英在核子武器生产上的垄断地位，力图防止更多的“原子国家”出现。它们还企图借此控制其它北大西洋公约国家的科学技术和物质力量，为它们的战争计划服务，同时又把扩充军备的一部分负担转嫁到北大西洋组织中的其它伙伴身上。
    第四，它们企图在“互相依赖”的口号下，为北大西洋组织创造一种新的“理论”基础，使这个正在解体中的军事集团稳定下来，并把它变为发射火箭、导弹和进行核子战争的基地。想当年，北大西洋集团是在这样一种“理论”下建立起来的：苏联将向西欧发动“进攻”，西欧国家必需在美国的支援下“组织起来”实行“集体自卫”；在这一被臆造出来的战争中，西欧国家的军队将作第一线的“抵抗”，然后是具有绝对的“原子优势”的美国，用它巨大的“威慑力量”给假想中的敌人以毁灭性的打击……。但是，在这个军事集团成立以后的几年中，发生了一些什么事情呢？那就是：苏联忠诚不渝地实行它的和平外交政策，和平共处的思想深入人心，而美国的“原子优势”也被粉碎了。因而这一旧的“理论”过时了，需要由一个新的理论来代替。
    美英之间的分歧
    但是，当一牵涉到具体问题的时候，标榜着要率先进行“真正合作”和实行“互相依赖”的美英之间，便出现了分歧。
    英国忍痛承认美国在核子军备上的霸主地位，但希望自己能稳坐第二把交椅，同美国共同实行垄断核武器的研究和生产。华盛顿会谈对此似乎作出了决定，在原则上宣布了美英在研究和发展核子武器方面的合作。问题是，这种“合作”是没有基础的。且看：英国有氢弹，美国也有；英国正在着手研究火箭，但在洲际导弹的研究上还没有开始，而美国至少比英国先走了一步。美国有什么必要把英国的地位抬高一些？相反地，美国恰恰打算利用这种“合作”的形式取得一些现成的好处，而又在“分工”的借口下限制英国在研究和制造核武器方面的进展。传说美国某些军方人士建议英国只作氢弹的研究，而由美国等进行生产，然后供应英国一定数量的核子武器。为此，麦克米伦授权两国专家小组中的英国代表，坚持英国必须进行氢弹和导弹的生产，无论美国提出什么样的建议。
    在“互相依赖”的口号下，英国希望加强它同西欧国家的联系，从而提高自己的地位。但这是美国所不愿意的。美国正在策划把西德用核武器装备起来，把它变为在美国控制下的核子战略基地，以贬低英国的地位。在突尼斯武器供应事件中，问题显得更清楚了：美国和英国都竭力想排挤法国在北非的势力，但就美国的策略来说，它还有一种利用英国和它共谋的关系，来离间英法关系的作用。当然，英国是不会不采取对策的。当法国大发雷霆之际，麦克米伦匆忙飞往巴黎，举行英法会谈，企图弥补两国之间的裂痕，并在北大西洋集团中扮演一个独特的角色。
    “有”的国家与“无”的国家
    在核子武器问题上，不但美国和英国之间充满着矛盾。在有核子武器的美英两国（特别是美国）同没有核子武器的其它国家之间，同样也充满着矛盾。
    12月份的北大西洋集团首脑会议上，美英将兜售它的“互相依赖”的具体计划。根据艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯等人的谈话，根据美国代表在北大西洋组织议会会议上的发言以及其他方面的报道，美国的想法大体是：一，在英国及其他北大西洋公约国家建立中距离的火箭基地；二，在西欧建立起在美国控制下的核子武器（包括火箭弹头）的储存；三，扩大现有的“盟国”人员处理原子弹及原子火箭的训练；四，对北大西洋公约成员国的“防御任务”重作分配，确定主次，以美国为中心；五，科学人材与情报的“共同使用”，美国则准备把麦克马洪法作某种程度的修改；六，使用核子武器的最后决定权，操于美国之手。
    北大西洋集团的成员国对美国计划的反应是大吃一惊。因为这个计划并未体现“互相依赖”的精神，而是要西欧国家进一步屈服于美国。对自己的“大国地位”特别敏感的法国，不满意美英在华盛顿会谈中预作安排，把它们制定的计划强加给北大西洋集团国家。法国更不甘心被剥夺制造核子武器的权“利”。憧憬着称霸西欧的西德，也并不乐于充当美国核子武器基地的角色。而西欧国家面临的更为现实的问题是：它们将被要求放弃多少国家主权？将在军费开支上多拨多少款项？而更重要的是，在美国挑起的一场核子战争中将得到什么样的结果？
    由此可见，“互相依赖”这个口号的提出，并不意味着资本主义国家更加团结的开始；而恰恰是它们之间的矛盾更加尖锐的开始。（附图片）
