The Friendship Between Two Ancient Universities of China and the Soviet Union
By our reporter Bai Sheng

	In late autumn, the Weiming Lake at Peking University is especially beautiful and elegant, with the autumn water reflecting several trees of red leaves. In this beautiful campus, whenever you meet any teacher or student, as long as you talk to them about the topic of Sino-Soviet friendship, they will enthusiastically and kindly tell you many stories about the close friendship between Moscow University and Peking University, these two ancient universities. "Moscow University's today is our tomorrow!" This is what many teachers and students of Peking University told me.

	Ancient Peking University has embarked on the path of a new type of socialist university from an old university under a bourgeois education system, and is advancing along the path of Moscow University. Since the adjustment of departments and faculties in 1952, when Peking University had just carried out reforms on the basis of learning from the advanced Soviet education system, many young departments and majors began to be established under the direction of learning from Moscow University. In the process of the young departments' growth, Moscow University constantly gave friendly and kind help.

	The teachers and students of Peking University will never forget that in the autumn of 1954, Academician Petrovsky, the president of Moscow University, came to Peking University for a visit, bringing with him the infinite friendship of the teachers and students of Moscow University to the teachers and students of Peking University. He also personally brought the outstanding academic works of the teachers of Moscow University, as well as various precious books, mineral rocks, and plant specimens. During his visit to Peking University, President Petrovsky also personally discussed with President Ma Yinchu the method of establishing direct contact between the two universities, and introduced in detail the teaching situation of Moscow University. This made the friendship between the two universities have new development from then on. Also in November 1954, the Soviet Ministry of Culture presented a marble statue of Lomonosov, the founder of Moscow University, to Peking University, which further deepened the close relationship between the two universities.

	In the professor's dormitory in Yandong Garden, I saw Professor Hou Renzhi of the Department of Geology and Geography. When we talked about the situation of the department, he told me at length how the growth of this young department had received the care and help of Moscow University. From the first day of its birth, this department has been advancing under the guidance of Moscow University. In the autumn of 1954, Petrovsky also came to the Department of Geology and Geography to observe when he visited Peking University. He encouraged this young, newly-built department, saying, "Don't think that you seem to be very small now, just think about the vast and distant land of your great motherland, the hardworking and numerous people, and your beautiful and far-reaching future, and you can see the future of this department that seems to be very small now!" President Petrovsky's kind conversation gave great encouragement to all the teachers and students of the department. In 1955, Professor Markov and Professor Grazovskaya of the Department of Geology and Geography of Moscow University also guided the scientific research work of Chen Chuankang and Chen Jingsheng, two teaching assistants of the Department of Geology and Geography of Peking University, by correspondence. Professor Hou Renzhi said that he also often corresponded with the Department of Geography of Moscow University, asking them for advice on some issues related to teaching and scientific research. In this way, although they were far apart, they established close contact. In 1956, when Professor Samoilov of the Department of Geography of Moscow University came to work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he also brought many precious gifts from the Department of Geography of Moscow University. Professor Lebedev, who is currently lecturing at the Department of Geology and Geography of Peking University, is also an outstanding scientist trained by Moscow University. He established the first geomorphology major for New China.

	The growth of the Department of Geology and Geography of Peking University with the kind help of Moscow University is just one example of the friendly help of Moscow University.

	Since 1952, Moscow University has sent several experts to help Peking University with its construction. Like Professor Gumachenko of Economics, Associate Professor Antonova of the Department of History, Professor Batrikaev of the Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office, Associate Professor Spinel of the Department of Physics, and Professor Georgiev of the Department of Philosophy, who is still lecturing at Peking University, have all made outstanding contributions to Peking University. On the first day that Professor Gumachenko arrived in China, he refused to rest and immediately ran to Peking University to start work. He not only taught two classes of graduate students, but also served as the president's advisor, helping Peking University with its teaching reform work. Because he was busy, he often had to work until late at night, and sometimes he insisted on going to class even when he was sick. He also often went to check on the students' learning. Therefore, his two years of work at Peking University left a deep and unforgettable impression on the teachers and students of Peking University. Associate Professor Antonova's high enthusiasm and serious and conscientious work attitude also moved the teachers and students of Peking University very much when they recalled it. When the students of the Department of History lacked materials for studying Soviet history, Antonova took advantage of her summer vacation to return to China and ran to the library of Moscow University to help collect many precious books, which were sent to the teachers and students of the Department of History of Peking University with the approval of the leaders of Moscow University. Expert Georgiev of the Department of Philosophy is an erudite expert sent by Moscow University. He opened a specialization course on dialectical materialism for the Department of Philosophy of Peking University. In order to enable Georgiev's expertise to be imparted to the teachers and students of Peking University, the teachers and students of the Department of Philosophy have requested the Ministry of Higher Education through the university to extend the appointment of expert Georgiev to continue lecturing at Peking University for another year. Now the expert has opened a specialization course on Lenin's philosophical notes for the Department of Philosophy of Peking University in this academic year.

	At Peking University, there are many students from the Soviet Union, many of whom are sent by Moscow University to study. In the Chinese Language Training Class for Foreign Students, I met a 21-year-old Soviet girl named Lyuba. She is a third-year student majoring in Chinese at the Oriental Institute of Moscow University. Because she loves Chinese literature, she left her motherland and came to Peking University to study in February this year. Now she can talk to me freely in fluent Chinese. She took me to her dormitory, where I saw many Chinese books on her bookshelf. She is carefully studying Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. She carefully wrote down the Russian translations of some Chinese words in the article. She told me that she is a member of the Communist Youth League, a daughter from a poor peasant family, and her father is now serving in the Soviet Air Force. She herself admires Chinese literature very much. She feels that the conditions and environment for learning Chinese in China are too good now. The Chinese teachers and Chinese students are so enthusiastic to help her learn. She has a young Chinese girlfriend named Zhang Yuying, who often enthusiastically helps her learn Chinese. Her exam scores are all five points, and she is now able to read some ordinary Chinese literary works. She has a beautiful ideal, which is to be a young envoy of Sino-Soviet friendship, exchanging Sino-Soviet culture.

	The friendship between Peking University and Moscow University is endless. In order to thank Moscow University for its gifts, Peking University presented 500 kinds of outstanding Chinese works and two metasequoia, a special product of China, to Moscow University. Among the 500 kinds of works, there were Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, Complete Works of Lu Xun, etc., as well as some important works by Peking University professors. On the occasion of the 200th anniversary of Moscow University, in addition to a specially made exquisite wool embroidery of the campus scene of Moscow University and a pair of large vases painted with portraits of Lomonosov, Peking University also presented a set of 820 volumes of the Twenty-Four Histories of China and a set of 2,100 volumes of the First Edition of Sibu Congkan to Moscow University. Vice President Zhou Peiyuan represented all the teachers and students of Peking University to attend the anniversary ceremony of Moscow University.

	Today, people working or studying at Peking University are proud to have Moscow University as a glorious example. Moving forward in the direction of Moscow University has become the direction of efforts for everyone at Peking University. The development of the friendship and cooperation between these two ancient universities also symbolizes the continuous development of the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    中苏两个古老大学的友谊
    本报记者　柏生
    深秋天气，北京大学的未名湖畔，一湖秋水映着几树红叶，格外显得美丽潇洒。在这个美丽的校园里，无论是当你遇到哪一位教师或同学，只要你和他一谈起中苏友谊的话题来，他们都会热情亲切地告诉你许多关于莫斯科大学和北京大学这两个古老大学之间亲密友谊的故事来。“莫斯科大学的今天就是我们的明天！”这是许多北大师生告诉我的话。
    古老的北京大学从一座旧的资产阶级教育制度下的大学走上了新型的社会主义大学的道路，就是沿着莫斯科大学的道路前进的。从1952年院系调整以来，北京大学在学习苏联先进教育制度的基础上刚刚进行了改革的时候，许多年青的系科和专业都开始在学习莫斯科大学的方向下建立起来了。年青系科在成长过程中，莫斯科大学不断地给予友谊的亲切的帮助。
    北京大学的师生都不会忘记1954年秋天，莫斯科大学校长彼得罗夫斯基院士，带着莫斯科大学师生对北京大学师生的无限友情，来到了北京大学进行访问。他并且亲自带来了莫斯科大学教师们卓越的学术著作，以及各种珍贵的书籍、矿物岩石和植物的标本。彼得罗夫斯基校长在北京大学访问期间，还亲自和马寅初校长商定了两校建立直接联系的办法，并详细地介绍了莫斯科大学的教学情况。使两校的友谊，从此有了新的发展。也是1954年的11月，苏联文化部更把一座莫斯科大学创始人——洛蒙诺索夫的大理石像赠送给了北京大学，这更加深了两校的亲密关系。
    在燕东园教授宿舍里，我看到了地质地理系侯仁之教授。我们一谈起系里的情况，他就滔滔地向我讲述了这个年青的系的成长是怎样得到莫斯科大学的关怀和帮助的。这个系从诞生的第一天起，就是在莫斯科大学方向的指导下前进着。1954年秋天，彼得罗夫斯基访问北京大学时，还来到地质地理系观看。他鼓励这个年青的新建系说，你们不要看你们现在好像很小，只要想想你们伟大祖国的辽阔远大的土地，勤劳众多的人民，以及你们美好远大的前途时，你们就可以看到这个现在好像是很小的一个系的未来了！彼得罗夫斯基校长亲切的谈话，给了全系师生很大的鼓舞。1955年莫斯科大学地质地理系马尔柯夫教授和格拉卓夫斯卡娅教授并以函授方式指导了北京大学地质地理系的陈传康和陈静生两位助教的科学研究工作。侯仁之教授说，他和莫斯科大学地理系也常有通信往来，向他们请教有关教学和科学研究方面的一些问题。就这样他们之间虽然路程相隔遥远，但建立了亲密的联系。1956年莫斯科大学地理系萨莫伊洛夫教授来中国科学院工作时，又带来了莫斯科大学地理系的许多珍贵礼物。目前还在北京大学地质地理系讲学的列别杰夫教授，也是莫斯科大学培养出来的优秀的科学家。他为新中国建立了第一个地貌学专业。
    北大地质地理系在莫斯科大学亲切帮助下的成长，只不过是莫斯科大学友谊帮助的一个例子。
    从1952年起，莫斯科大学就先后派来了好几位专家帮助北京大学建设。像最早来到的经济学教授古马青珂，历史系副教授安东诺娃，马列主义教研室教授巴特里卡耶夫，物理系副教授斯比涅耳，以及目前仍留在北大讲学的哲学系教授格奥尔基耶夫等人，都为北京大学作出了卓越的贡献。古马青珂教授初到中国的第一天，连休息一下也不肯，就立刻跑到北京大学开始了工作。他不仅给两班研究生开课，而且还担负着校长的顾问的职务，帮助北大进行教学改革工作。因为忙，他经常要工作到深夜，有时病了也坚持着去上课。他还常常去检查同学们的学习情况。因此他在北京大学工作的两年，给北大师生留下了深刻难忘的印象。安东诺娃副教授的高度热情和严肃认真的工作态度，也使北大师生一回忆起来，就非常感动。当历史系同学们在研究苏联史资料缺乏时，安东诺娃乘着暑假回国时，跑到莫斯科大学图书馆去帮助搜集了许多珍贵的书籍，经过莫斯科大学领导上的批准，寄赠给北大历史系的师生。哲学系专家格奥尔基耶夫，更是莫斯科大学派来的一位博学的专家。他为北大哲学系开设了辩证唯物主义专门化课程。北大哲学系师生为了使格奥尔基耶夫的专长能更多地传授给北大师生，已通过校方向高等教育部请求延聘格奥尔基耶夫专家继续在北大讲学一年。现在专家在本学年又为北大哲学系开设了列宁的哲学笔记专门化课程。
    在北京大学里，有不少来自苏联的留学生，其中有许多是莫斯科大学派来学习的。在外国留学生中国语文专修班里，我曾经遇到过一位叫柳芭的二十一岁的苏联姑娘，她是莫斯科大学东方学院中文专业三年级学生，由于爱好中国文学，她离开了祖国，在今年二月来到北京大学学习。现在她已经能用一口十分流利的中国话和我自由地交谈。她带我到她的宿舍里，我看到她的书架上放了许多中国书籍。她正在细心地钻研学习着毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题的讲话。对于文中的一些中文生字，她都仔细认真地用俄文注写着。她告诉我她是一个共青团员，一个贫农家庭出身的女儿，父亲现在苏联空军服务。她自己非常爱慕中国文学。她感到现在在中国学习中文的条件和环境都太好了。中国老师和中国同学是那么热情地帮助她学习，她有一个年青的中国女朋友，叫张玉英，经常热情地帮助她学习中文，她的考试成绩都是五分，现在已经能够看一些普通的中国文学作品了。她有一个美好的理想，就是做一个传播中苏友谊、交流中苏文化的青年使者。
    北京大学和莫斯科大学之间的友谊是说不完的。北京大学为了答谢莫斯科大学的赠礼，曾以五百种我国出版的各种优秀著作，和两棵我国特产植物水杉回赠给莫斯科大学。在五百种著作中，包括有三国演义、红楼梦、鲁迅全集等，以及北大教授们的一些重要著作。在莫斯科大学二百周年校庆时，北京大学除特制了一大幅莫斯科大学校景的精致的毛绣和一对绘有洛蒙诺索夫像的大花瓶外，还把一部八百二十册的中国二十四史和一部二千一百册的四部丛刊初编赠送给了莫斯科大学。周培源副校长代表北京大学全体师生前往莫斯科大学参加了校庆典礼。
    今天无论在北京大学工作或学习的人们，都因为有莫斯科大学这样一个光辉的榜样而感到骄傲。朝着莫斯科大学的方向前进，已经成为每一个北京大学的人努力的方向。这两个古老大学的友谊合作的发展，也正象征着中苏两国人民友谊的不断发展。
