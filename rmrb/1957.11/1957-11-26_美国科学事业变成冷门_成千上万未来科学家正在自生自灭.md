Xinhua News Agency, New York, 25th: Associated Press science reporter Alton Blakeslee said that in the United States, "many bright young people are being forced out of science" and "tens of thousands of future scientists are being left to fend for themselves."

He said: "High school and college students are often reluctant to study science because they see higher incomes and rewards in sales, advertising, medicine, business, entertainment, and other industries."

He pointed out that "the National Science Foundation, after surveying 50,000 male and female scientists, reported that in 1954 and 1955, half of the American scientists earned less than $6,525 per year."

Blakeslee also pointed out that many students in the United States are unwilling to take science courses because schools do not pay enough attention to science or because science teaching methods are backward. He wrote: "In schools, science and mathematics courses are not given enough importance, including not early enough and not good enough. Mathematics is the cornerstone of science and modern life. But many students in the United States regard algebra as a terrible word."

    美国科学事业变成冷门
    成千上万未来科学家正在自生自灭
    据新华社25日讯　纽约消息：美联社科学记者布来克斯利说，美国“有许多聪明的青年正在被迫脱离科学”，“成千成万的未来科学家正在自生自灭”。
    他说：“中学和大学的学生常常不愿意攻读科学，因为他们看到买卖、广告、医药、企业、娱乐和其他行业有更高的收入和报酬。”
    他指出，“全国科学基金会对五万个男女科学家进行调查后报道说，在1954年和1955年，美国科学家中有一半人的每年收入不到六千五百二十五美元。”
    布来克斯利还指出：美国有许多学生由于学校不重视科学或者由于科学的教学方法落后而不愿上科学课，他写道：“在学校里，科学和数学的课程没有受到足够的重视，包括重视得不够早和不够好。数学是科学和现代生活方式的基石。但是美国有许多学生把代数当作是一个可怕的字眼。”
