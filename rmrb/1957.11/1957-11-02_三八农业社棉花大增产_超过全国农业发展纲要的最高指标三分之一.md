Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, November 1st: The Sanba Agricultural Cooperative in Makit County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of the 2,358 mu of cotton planted this year. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu from these cotton fields was 47.59 jin, exceeding the highest target for cotton unit area yield set in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) for the next twelve years by more than one-third.

This year, the Sanba Agricultural Cooperative used all Soviet high-quality cotton seeds, promoted advanced Soviet cotton planting experience, and strengthened field management, resulting in high yields on all more than two thousand mu of cotton. The cooperative's more than 1,300 mu of "108F" medium-staple cotton can produce 450 jin of ginned cotton per mu; more than 40 mu of "Two-Three" long-staple cotton reached a yield of 425.9 jin per mu, setting a new record for high-yield long-staple cotton in Xinjiang. Due to the later arrival of autumn frost compared to previous years, most of the cotton in the Sanba Agricultural Cooperative this year was frost-front cotton, and more than 900 mu of early-maturing "Si San Yi Qi San" cotton can be harvested completely before the frost.

The high-yield record of cotton in the Sanba Agricultural Cooperative in Makit County shows that in southern Xinjiang, where the climate, soil, and other natural conditions are very similar to those of Makit, the cotton unit area yield has the potential to reach or exceed the highest target set in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) for the next twelve years.

    三八农业社棉花大增产
    超过全国农业发展纲要的最高指标三分之一
    新华社乌鲁木齐1日电　新疆维吾尔自治区麦盖提县三八农业社，今年种植的二千三百五十八亩棉花，获得了大面积丰收。这些棉田平均每亩产籽棉四十七点五九斤，超过了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）提出的十二年内棉花单位面积产量要达到的最高指标三分之一以上。
    三八农业社今年棉花全部采用了苏联优良棉种，并推行了苏联先进植棉经验，加强了田间管理，使两千多亩棉花全部获得高额丰产。全社一千三百多亩“一零八夫”中绒棉，每亩可产籽棉四百五十斤；四十多亩“二与三”长绒棉亩产达到四百二十五点九斤，创造了新疆长绒棉高额丰产纪录。由于秋霜比往年降得迟，三八农业社今年大部棉花都是霜前花，九百多亩早熟的
  “斯三一七三”棉花，可在霜前全部收完。
    麦盖提县三八农业社棉花的丰产纪录表明，在气候、土壤等自然条件和麦盖提十分相近的南疆地区棉花单位面积产量，都有可能达到或超过全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）提出的十二年内的最高指标。
