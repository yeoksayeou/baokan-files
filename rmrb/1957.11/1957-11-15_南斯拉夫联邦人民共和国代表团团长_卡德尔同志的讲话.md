Dear Comrades, esteemed representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union! I am deeply honored to have this opportunity, on this great festival of the Soviet working people and all progressive humanity, to extend warm greetings from the people of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Communists to the Soviet people and the Communist Party, and to congratulate them on the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. I wish them further achievements in the struggle for peace and socialist construction! (Applause)

The October Revolution was not only a turning point in the history of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union but also a turning point in the history of all mankind. After the October Revolution crushed the autocracy, capitalism, and feudal remnants in Russia, it shook the centuries-old stagnation of the old society on this vast land of the world. Forty years ago, the proletariat of Petrograd raised the red flag of the revolutionary struggle of the working class throughout the world in the October days. Soldiers in the trenches of the First World War welcomed this flag with unconcealed excitement, because it announced the imminent end of the war and the establishment of peace among nations. French sailors near Odessa, German workers, Norwegian fishermen, textile workers in Barcelona, workers in Guangzhou, foundry workers in Pittsburgh, Mexican farmers, people groaning under the yoke of colonialism, workers and peasants in what is now Yugoslavia, all progressive forces and all oppressed people on Earth welcomed this flag.

In the eyes of millions of people around the world appeared the magnificent and unforgettable image of a warrior – a revolutionary, a communist – the image of the great Lenin. Lenin's words resonated on every continent, awakening the hopes of millions of working people and arousing fear in the enemies of the working class, the enemies of socialism. And Lenin's Bolshevik Party – the ideological leader and driving force of this great social transformation – became an example and hope for all forces and people in the world who opposed poverty, exploitation, and enslavement, and first and foremost, the example and hope for the working class around the world. (Applause)

Since then, the great revolutionary tide of thought that brought about fundamental social changes has swept into all countries of the world and, through various political, economic, and other social struggles employed by the advanced forces of mankind, has changed the face of the world and its social structure.

The peoples of today's Yugoslavia, who were groaning under the yoke of war, exploitation, and national enslavement, warmly welcomed the October Revolution and Lenin, considering it a symbol of the beginning of a new era and a ray of light in the dark disasters of war.

This enthusiasm was manifested in the fact that during the October Revolution, there were 30,000 Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians, and Montenegrins in the ranks of the Red Guards and the Red Army, and in the flames of the revolution, heroes such as Oleko Dundich and Danilo Sergic emerged. (Applause) This enthusiasm was also manifested in the magnificent revolutionary wave that swept across the land of what is now Yugoslavia, starting at the end of 1917. The mutinies of frontline troops and sailors on warships under the red flag of the October Revolution, the unstoppable wave of strikes and demonstrations that developed into bloody conflicts and seized power in various places, and the mass peasant uprisings, etc., this was the situation in our country in the first few years after the October Revolution. The oppressed and exploited working people of our country embarked on the path pointed out by the Great October Revolution and Lenin. (Applause)

Although the working class and peasants of Yugoslavia did not achieve significant victories in the initial revolutionary conflicts, the October Revolution gave them great strength and confidence in the future. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia was established in 1919. The Party accepted the ideas of the October Revolution and Lenin's doctrine, and on the day of its birth, it warmly congratulated the people and country of the October Revolution and rose to defend it.

Terrified by the growing influence and strength of the Communist Party, the reactionaries of Yugoslavia declared the Communist Party illegal, and Communists were arrested, tried, and killed. Thus began a long and arduous period of underground work, a period of police terror, prisons, and penal servitude.

But the sparks of revolution that had erupted could not be extinguished!

In 1941, when all of Europe was groaning under Hitler's iron heel, and German fascist troops were rushing towards Moscow and the cradle of the revolution – Leningrad, we celebrated the twenty-fourth anniversary of the October Revolution with our own revolution on our liberated territory, together with tens of thousands of fighters who immediately took up arms at the call of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and under its leadership after Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union. When initiating the uprising, we Yugoslav Communists fulfilled our own responsibility to the people. But this also showed to the highest degree our spirit of proletarian solidarity with the first socialist country, with the working class, frontline soldiers, and people of this country. (Applause)

Our revolution and socialist construction relied on the achievements of the October Revolution and, under the conditions of the Second World War and the People's Liberation War of our people, and in the anti-fascist struggle of the people of the world, not mechanically, but creatively utilized the experience of the October Revolution.

Today, the people of Yugoslavia are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution in a socialist country that has achieved great economic and social construction achievements. Today, we are building friendly relations and cooperation between the people of Yugoslavia and the people of the Soviet Union together with you. The basis of this friendly relationship and cooperation is the great idea of ​​proletarian internationalism and the equality of rights of all independent countries. (Applause) Today we are recalling those great and historic days with you and are happy for the tremendous achievements made ​​by the Soviet people on the road to socialism and communism. The Soviet Union is no ​​longer an economically backward country, but a highly developed industrial power with strong economic and technological potential. The Soviet Union is no ​​longer an isolated socialist island besieged, because its victory and the victory of the working class and progressive forces of other countries have changed the world around it and turned socialism into a world trend, greatly strengthening the socialist forces and forces of peace in the world. (Applause) Today we are happy together with you for the progress and achievements of Soviet science and technology, which have been known and talked about all over the world recently, which is a clear demonstration of Soviet scientific and technological progress.

Today, when we talk about our victories, about the victories of the people of Yugoslavia, we have not forgotten for a minute that the source of these victories is the great October Socialist Revolution and that their foundation is the tremendous achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. (Applause) Therefore, we are happy for every new achievement and progress made ​​by the Soviet working people on the road to socialism and communism, because we believe that their victory does not ​​only belong to the Soviet working people, but is also a contribution to the cause of socialist progress throughout the world, and a contribution to consolidating the cause of peace.

I would like to take this solemn opportunity, from this lofty platform, to emphasize how deeply the people of Yugoslavia hope to guarantee peace, hope to finally start solving the problem of disarmament, to achieve a ban on the production, testing, and use of thermonuclear weapons, and to fully develop cooperation between countries and peoples with different social systems in the East and West.

Today, when socialism has become a huge force and has a decisive influence on the future destiny of the world, we should once again declare from this lofty platform that not ​​only is the idea of ​​planning war incompatible with socialist thought, but that the era in which war was used as a means of resolving disputes between countries should have been ​​long gone, along with the imperialist aggression against peace and national independence. Socialist countries do not ​​want to impose their own social system on anyone, they will always respect the will of each country to independently decide its own domestic social structure, but it is precisely for this reason that they demand that other countries also respect the will of those countries that have chosen the path of building new social relations, so that they can freely and unhinderedly establish a socialist social system.

Comrades, finally, let me, on behalf of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, on behalf of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and on behalf of all the working people of our country, once again pay tribute to you – the representatives of the Soviet working people of the Supreme Soviet, and through you, to all the working people of the Soviet Union! Pay tribute to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee, which lead the Soviet working people in the struggle for the victory of socialism and communism! (Applause)

In congratulating you on this great festival – which is also our common festival – we wish you new achievements in the construction of communism, in creative work and the development of productive forces, in further improving the living standards of the Soviet people, in the struggle for peace among all nations, and in further unhindered development and realization of the ideas born forty years ago, proclaimed by the guns of the cruiser "Aurora," and formed by the great genius Lenin.

Long live the Great October Revolution!
Glory belongs to the immortal Lenin!
Long live the peoples of the Soviet Union and their glorious Communist Party! (Prolonged applause)

    南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国代表团团长
    卡德尔同志的讲话
    亲爱的同志们，苏联最高苏维埃各位代表们！我十分荣幸，有此机会在苏联劳动人民和全体进步人类的这一伟大的节日代表南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国人民和南斯拉夫共产党人向苏联人民以及共产党致以热烈的敬礼，祝贺伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年，祝他们在争取和平和社会主义建设的斗争中获得进一步成就。（掌声）
    十月革命不仅是苏联各族人民历史上的转折点，同时也是全人类历史的转折点。十月革命在俄国击溃了专制政体、资本主义和封建主义残余以后，在世界这个广大地面上动摇了旧社会几世纪以来的停滞。四十年以前，彼得堡的无产阶级在十月的日子里高举起全世界工人阶级革命斗争的红旗。第一次世界大战战壕中的士兵们以掩藏不住的兴奋心情欢迎这面旗帜，因为这面旗帜宣布了战争即将结束和各国人民间的和平就要建立。敖德萨附近的法国水兵，德国工人，挪威的渔民，巴塞罗纳的纺织工人，广州的工人，匹兹堡的铸工，墨西哥的农民，在殖民主义枷锁下呻吟的人民，现在南斯拉夫的工人和农民，地球上一切进步力量和一切被压迫的人都欢迎这面旗帜。
    在世界各地千百万人的眼前出现了战士——革命者、共产党人的雄伟的难以忘怀的形象——伟大列宁的形象。列宁的话在各个大陆上引起了反应，唤起了千百万劳动人民的希望，引起了工人阶级的敌人、社会主义的敌人的恐惧。而列宁的布尔什维克党——这个伟大社会变革的思想领导力量和动力，成为世界上一切反对贫困、剥削和奴役的力量和人们的榜样和希望，首先成为全世界工人阶级的榜样和希望。（掌声）
    从那时候起，这种引起社会根本变化的伟大革命的思想浪潮，冲进了世界所有国家，并通过人类先进力量运用各种不同的政治、经济和其他社会斗争的方式方法，改变着世界面貌和社会结构。
    那时候正在战争、剥削和民族奴役的枷锁下呻吟的今日南斯拉夫的各族人民，曾经热忱地欢迎十月革命和列宁，认为这是新时代开始的象征，是黑暗的战争灾难中的一线光明。
    这种热情表现在：十月革命时，在赤卫军和红军的队伍中有三万个塞尔维亚人、克罗地亚人、斯洛文人、马其顿人和门的内哥罗人，在革命的战火里他们之中出现了像奥列科·敦季奇和达尼洛·塞尔集奇等等这样的英雄人物。（掌声）这种热情也表现在波澜壮阔的革命浪潮从1917年底开始席卷了今日的南斯拉夫的土地。前线军队和兵舰上水兵在十月革命的红旗下举行的暴动，不可遏止的罢工、游行示威的浪潮发展成为流血冲突并且在各地夺取了政权，还有群众性的农民暴动等等，这就是我国在十月革命后最初几年的景况。我国被压迫和被剥削的劳动人民走上了伟大十月革命和列宁所指出的道路。（掌声）
    虽然在最初若干次的革命冲突中南斯拉夫的工人阶级和农民并未取得重大的胜利，可是十月革命给了他们巨大的力量和对未来的信心。1919年建立了南斯拉夫共产党，这个党接受了十月革命的思想和列宁的学说，并且在它诞生的那一天就热烈祝贺十月革命的人民和国家，并起来保卫十月革命。
    南斯拉夫的反动派慑于共产党的影响和力量的加强，宣布共产党为非法，共产党员受到逮捕、审判和杀害。于是开始了长期的艰苦的地下工作，开始了警察恐怖、监狱和苦役的时期。
    可是爆发出来的革命的火星是熄灭不了的！
    1941年当全欧洲正在希特勒的铁蹄下呻吟，德国法西斯军队冲向莫斯科和革命的摇篮——列宁格勒的时候，我们在自己的解放了的国土上，同成千成万在希特勒进攻苏联之后马上根据南斯拉夫共产党的号召并且在它的领导下拿起了武器的战士在一起用自己的革命迎接了十月革命的二十四周年。我们南斯拉夫的共产党人在发动起义时，是执行了它自己对人民的职责。但是这也最高度地表现了我们对第一个社会主义国家，对这个国家的工人阶级、前线战士和它的人民的无产阶级团结一致的精神。（掌声）
    我国的革命和社会主义建设是依靠了十月革命的成果，并且在第二次世界大战的条件下，在我国人民的人民解放战争的条件下，在全世界人民反法西斯斗争的条件下，不是机械地、而是创造性地利用了十月革命的经验。
    今天，南斯拉夫人民在一个取得很大经济和社会建设成就的社会主义国家里庆祝十月革命四十周年。今天我们同你们一道在南斯拉夫人民和苏联人民之间建立友好关系和合作。这种友好关系和合作的基础是无产阶级国际主义和各个独立国家权利平等的伟大思想。（掌声）今天我们同你们在一道回忆着那些伟大的具有历史意义的日子，并且为苏联人民在社会主义和共产主义道路上所取得的巨大成就而感到高兴。苏联已经不再是经济上落后的国家，而是一个具有强大经济和技术潜能的高度发达的工业强国。苏联不再是一个被围困的社会主义孤岛，因为它的胜利以及其他国家工人阶级和进步力量的胜利改变了它的周围世界，并把社会主义变成了一个世界潮流，大大地加强了世界上社会主义力量和和平力量。（掌声）今天我们同你们一道为苏联科学技术的进步和成就而感到高兴，最近以来全世界都知道并谈论着的成就是苏联科学技术进步的明证。
    今天当我们谈到我们的胜利、谈到南斯拉夫人民的胜利时，我们一分钟也没有忘记，这些胜利的源泉是伟大的十月社会主义革命，它们的基础是苏联社会主义建设的巨大成就。（掌声）因此我们为苏联劳动人民在社会主义和共产主义道路上所取得的每一个新的成就和进步而感到高兴，因为我们认为，他们的胜利不仅属于苏联劳动人民，同时也是对整个世界社会主义进步事业的贡献，是对巩固和平事业的贡献。
    我利用这个隆重的机会，在这个崇高的讲台上强调指出，南斯拉夫的人民是多么深切地希望能保证和平，希望能终于着手解决裁军问题，达到禁止生产、试验和使用热核武器，使各个社会制度不同的东西方国家和人民之间的合作得到全面发展。
    今天，当社会主义已成为巨大的力量并且对世界今后的命运有着决定性影响的时候，我们在这崇高的讲台上应当再一次地声明，不仅筹划战争的想法和社会主义思想毫不相容，而且现在已经是时候了，把战争作为解决国家间争端的手段的时代应该跟帝国主义对和平和民族独立的侵犯一起永远地成为过去了。社会主义国家不想把自己的社会制度强加于任何人，他们永远尊重每个国家独立地决定自己国内社会结构问题的意志，但也正是由于这个原因他们要求其他国家也尊重那些选择了建设新的社会关系道路的各国的意志，以便让他们能够自由地、毫无阻碍地建立社会主义社会制度。
    同志们，最后让我代表南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国、代表南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会、代表我国全体劳动人民再一次地向你们——最高苏维埃的苏联劳动人民的代表们，并通过你们向全体苏联劳动人民致敬！向领导苏联劳动人民为社会主义和共产主义胜利而斗争的苏联共产党和它的中央委员会致敬！（掌声）
    在向你们祝贺伟大节日——同时也是我们共同的节日——的时候，我们预祝你们在共产主义的建设中、在创造性的工作和发展生产力方面、在进一步提高苏联人民生活水平方面、在争取各国人民的和平的斗争中、在进一步无阻碍地发展和实现四十年前“阿芙乐尔”号巡洋舰的炮声所宣布诞生的、伟大的天才列宁所形成的那种思想方面取得新的成就。
    伟大的十月革命万岁！
    光荣属于不朽的列宁！
    苏联各族人民和他们光荣的共产党万岁！（经久不息的掌声）
