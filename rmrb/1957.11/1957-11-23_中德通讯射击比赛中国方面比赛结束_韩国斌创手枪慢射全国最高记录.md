    China-Germany Correspondence Shooting Competition Concludes in China
    Han Guobin Sets National Record in Pistol Slow Fire
    (Our newspaper reports) The correspondence shooting competition between China and the German Democratic Republic, the Chinese side has completed the last event yesterday - the men's small-bore pistol 50-meter distance No. 4 bullseye slow fire competition.
    The Chinese team participating in yesterday's men's small-bore pistol slow fire competition included five shooters: Han Guobin, Zhang Hong, Li Jie, Li Peilin, and Zhang Yan. They fired two thousand six hundred and ninety-nine rings with three hundred bullets (the full ring is three thousand rings). Han Guobin created excellent results in this competition. He fired five hundred and sixty-five rings with sixty bullets. This result is only one ring less than the 566-ring record created by Rinos涅 (Finland), the first place winner of the 16th Olympic Games. This result has exceeded the national record of 553 rings held by Zhang Hong. Zhang Hong tied his own record this time.
    The total scores of the Chinese team in the other three events are: Men's small-bore rifle 50-meter distance prone, kneeling, and standing position competition, five thousand six hundred and fourteen rings; Women's small-bore rifle 50-meter distance prone, kneeling, and standing position competition, five thousand six hundred and sixty-seven rings; Men's small-bore pistol 25-meter distance silhouette target rapid fire competition, two hundred and ninety-eight silhouette targets, two thousand eight hundred and thirty-one rings.
    The total scores of both sides in this competition will have to wait until our scores are sent to the German Democratic Republic, and the German Democratic Republic will make a final evaluation based on the results of both sides.

    中德通讯射击比赛中国方面比赛结束
    韩国斌创手枪慢射全国最高记录
    本报讯　中国和德意志民主共和国之间的通讯射击比赛，中国方面已在昨日举行完最后一个项目——男子小口径手枪五十公尺距离四号环靶慢射比赛。
    参加昨日的男子小口径手枪慢射比赛的中国队有韩国斌、张鈜、李杰、李培林、张炎等五名射手。他们用三百发子弹打了二千六百九十九环（满环是三千环）。韩国斌在这项比赛中创造了优秀的成绩。他六十发子弹，打了五百六十五环。这个成绩比十六届奥林匹克运动会第一名里诺斯涅（芬兰）所创造的五百六十六环的纪录只少一环。这个成绩已超过了张鈜所保持的五百五十三环的全国最高纪录。张鈜这次平他自己所保持的纪录。
    其他三个项目中国队的总成绩是：男子小口径步枪五十公尺距离卧、跪、立姿比赛，五千六百一十四环；女子小口径步枪五十公尺距离卧、跪、立姿比赛，五千六百六十七环；男子小口径手枪二十五公尺距离人像靶速射比赛，二百九十八个人像靶，二千八百三十一环。
    这次比赛的双方总成绩要等我们的成绩寄到民主德国后，民主德国方面再根据双方的比赛结果，最后评定。
