    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 6th. The plenary session of the International Red Cross Conference resumed on the afternoon of the 5th. The U.S. government delegation spoke first during the discussion, using the conference podium to promote the "Two Chinas" proposition.

    The U.S. delegation put forward a proposal requesting the conference to invite delegations from each organization "according to their respective official names," attempting to use this method to allow the Chiang Kai-shek clique to be accepted to participate in the conference. Prior to this, the Chiang Kai-shek clique had protested being referred to as the "Formosa Government," hoping to receive an invitation under the so-called "Republic of China" name.

    Two representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique are waiting in Delhi in order to participate in the conference meetings once the American proposal is passed.

    Pan Zili, the head of the Chinese government delegation, vehemently refuted and exposed the political conspiracy of the American delegation. His speech was met with prolonged applause. Canadian Macaulay, who replaced India's Kaur as chair, repeatedly interrupted his speech under the pretext of "political issues."

    Karmarkar, the head of the Indian government delegation, said that the intention of the American proposal was to send invitations to the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He announced: "We believe that the People's Republic of China is the sole representative of China, and we cannot agree to issuing an invitation to Formosa, directly or indirectly." He indicated that the Indian government delegation would vote against the American proposal. "We are completely opposed to Formosa having representatives participate in this conference or any other conference."

    The proposal put forward by the Chinese delegation pointed that the People's Republic of China government delegation and the Chinese Red Cross delegation are the official members representing China in the International Red Cross Conference, and considering the "International Red Cross Charter," requested that the conference resolve that the Chiang Kai-shek clique "shall not attend the 19th International Red Cross Conference under any name."

    The head of the Polish government delegation supported the Swedish proposal. The Swedish proposal suggested referring the issue back to the Standing Committee of the International Red Cross Conference for discussion. The Soviet representative said that the issue was not on the agenda of the conference at all. The purpose of the U.S. government delegation was to raise political disputes while at the same time concealing themselves under the name of "non-political."

    Representatives from Venezuela, Argentina, and Ireland supported the American proposal and requested that the conference vote on it.

    The conference discussion will continue, and is scheduled to resume on the morning of the 6th.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 6th. The plenary session of the International Red Cross Conference continued to meet on the morning of the 6th. In two half-day debates, the American attempt to disrupt the conference by having Chiang Kai-shek elements participate has been thoroughly exposed.

    Many speakers exposed the so-called "non-political" nature of the American proposal. The American proposal intends to invite the Chiang Kai-shek clique and disrupt the conference as it is about to conclude. The speeches of the Soviet government representative and the Indian chair of the conference, Amrit Kaur, revealed the true nature of this American action.

    Soviet representative Miterev said that the only purpose of the American proposal was to have a Taiwan representative participate in the conference and impose this decision on the conference. He pointed out: there are already attending the conference "the legitimate representatives of China from the People's Republic of China, representing six hundred million Chinese people, and Taiwan is only a part of the great People's Republic of China."

    The American delegation and other delegations threatened to withdraw from the conference if the American proposal failed. Speaking of this threat, Miterev said that the responsibility for disrupting the conference would be borne by the American government delegation that put forward the proposal. He requested the conference to declare the American proposal out of order. He said: "If we want our conference to be successful, we should not allow a Taiwan representative to participate in this conference." He asked: "Why should we let our conference fail just because the American representative wants to see a Taiwan representative at this conference?"

    Amrit Kaur, in explaining the attitude of the host country, the Indian Red Cross, indicated that the International Red Cross Conference "does not recognize the Taiwan Red Cross, and the Red Cross of the People's Republic of China is its official member." She indicated that if the conference passed any proposal that allowed Taiwan to participate in the conference under a name not designated by the host country, "if it attempts to force the host country to accept such a decision, the host country will not cooperate with the conference."

    Speaking of the American proposal, Kaur said: "It is very impolite to place the host country in such a difficult situation." She requested that the conference not allow the government delegation to halt the work of the conference, and reiterated the position of the Indian Red Cross, saying: "If you want us as the host to cancel our decision and accept any other decision, I will not do so."

    Representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Indonesia, Democratic Korea, Romania, and India supported the Swedish proposal to refer the issue back to the Standing Committee. However, representatives from South Korea, the Philippines, and certain Latin American countries insisted on supporting the American proposal.

    The conference decided to vote on all four proposals put forward by the Chinese, Swedish, American, and Swiss delegations.

    The conference first voted on the Swiss proposal. The Swiss proposal requested that invitations to participate in the International Red Cross Conference be issued to all governments "exercising power over territories to which the Geneva Conventions apply," "regardless of whether these governments are recognized by other signatory states."

    The Swiss proposal passed with seventy-nine votes in favor, including the United States, the Philippines, South Korea, and certain Latin American countries.

    The government and Red Cross delegations of the People's Republic of China opposed the Swiss proposal. The twenty-nine votes against the Swiss proposal also included the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    Fourteen votes abstained, including India, Egypt, the United Kingdom, and others.

    The Polish government representative proposed an amendment to the Swedish proposal. He suggested referring all three other proposals back to the Standing Committee. This amendment was rejected by a vote of forty-five in favor to fifty-three against.

    The Swedish proposal was rejected. Fifty-seven votes against, including the United States and other countries. Forty-six votes in favor, including India, the Soviet Union, and Burma. Eighteen votes abstained, including China.

    Countries with both government and Red Cross representatives participating in the conference can cast two votes. Some countries only have government delegations participating, therefore only having one vote to cast.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 6th. The plenary session of the International Red Cross Conference decided on the afternoon of the 6th to postpone consideration of the Chinese and American proposals to the afternoon of the 7th, as the last item on the conference agenda. This decision was made based on a motion put forward by the Brazilian Red Cross.

    Because of the American proposal to have Chiang Kai-shek clique elements participate in the conference, the conference is facing the danger of division. The Indian and other country delegations have repeatedly expressed their opposition to the American proposal.

    Indian representative Kaur once again told the conference that the American proposal was out of order. She indicated that if the American proposal was passed, the host country would not be able to cooperate with the conference. Many other representatives also requested a postponement of the discussion.

    During the one-hour adjournment of the conference, the council held a meeting and listed this issue as the last item on the conference agenda. Then, the meeting continued according to the original agenda.

    不许蒋帮以任何名义出席国际红十字大会
    我代表严斥美国政治阴谋
    苏联代表支持我立场　印度代表不同意蒋帮参加会议
    新华社新德里6日电　国际红十字大会全体会议在5日下午复会。美国政府代表团在讨论中首先发言，利用大会讲坛宣传“两个中国”的主张。
    美国代表团提出一项提案，要求大会“按照各自的正式名称”邀请各组织的代表团，企图用这种办法来使蒋介石集团被接纳参加大会。在这以前，蒋介石集团曾经因为被称作“福摩萨政府”而提出抗议，它希望以所谓“中华民国”的名义接到邀请。
    有两名蒋介石集团的代表正在德里等候，以便一旦美国的提案获得通过就参加大会会议。
    中国政府代表团团长潘自力猛烈地驳斥和揭露了美国代表团的政治阴谋。他的发言获得了长期的掌声。代替印度的考尔女士担任主席的加拿大的马考莱曾经一再以“政治问题”为借口打断他的发言。
    印度政府代表团团长卡马卡尔说，美国提案的意图是要把请柬发给蒋介石集团。他宣布：“我们认为，中华人民共和国是中国的唯一代表，我们不能同意直接或者间接向福摩萨发出邀请。”他表明，印度政府代表团将投票反对美国的提案。“我们完全反对福摩萨有代表参加这个会议或任何其他会议。”
    中国代表团提出的提案指出，中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团是代表中国参加国际红十字大会的正式成员，考虑到“国际红十字章程”，要求大会决议蒋介石集团“不得以任何名义出席第十九届国际红十字大会”。
    波兰政府代表团团长支持瑞典的提案。瑞典的提案建议把这个问题交回国际红十字大会常设委员会讨论。苏联代表说，这个问题根本不在大会的议程上。美国政府代表团的目的就是想提出政治争执，同时又用“非政治”的名义把自己掩护起来。
    委内瑞拉、阿根廷和爱尔兰的代表们支持美国的提案，并且要求大会对这个提案进行表决。
    大会的讨论将继续进行，预定在6日上午复会。
    新华社新德里6日电　国际红十字大会全体会议6日上午继续开会。在两次半天的辩论中，美国企图使蒋介石分子参加从而破坏会议，这阴谋已被彻底揭穿。
    许多发言的人都揭穿了美国提案的所谓“非政治”性质。美国的提案打算邀请蒋介石集团，而在大会行将结束时破坏会议。苏联政府代表和大会的印度主席阿姆里特·考尔的发言使美国这一行动原形毕露。
    苏联代表米捷列夫说，美国提案的唯一目的就是使一个台湾代表参加大会，而且把这个决定强加于大会。他指出：出席大会的已有“代表着六亿中国人民的中华人民共和国的中国合法代表，而台湾只是伟大的中华人民共和国的一部分”。
    美国代表团和其他代表团扬言，如果美国的提案遭到失败的话，他们将退出大会。在谈到这种威胁时，米捷列夫说，这种破坏大会的责任将由提出那个提案的美国政府代表担负。他要求大会宣布美国提案不合议事规则。他说：“如果我们希望我们的大会成功，我们就不应当容许台湾代表参加这个大会。”他问道：“为什么只因为美国代表希望看到这个大会上有一个台湾代表就让我们大会的工作失败呢？”
    阿姆里特·考尔在解释东道国印度红十字会的态度时表明，国际红十字大会“并不承认台湾的红十字会，而中华人民共和国的红十字会是它的正式会员”。她表明，如果大会通过任何提案而让台湾以并非东道国所指定的名称来参加会议的话，“如果力图强使东道国接受这样一种决定的话，东道国将不同大会合作。”
    在谈到美国的提案时，考尔说：“把东道国置于这样一个困难的境地，这是非常不礼貌的。”它要求大会不要允许政府代表团停止大会的工作，并且重申印度红十字会的立场说：“如果你要我们做主人的取消我们的决定，而接受任何其它决定，我是不会这样做的。”
    苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度尼西亚、民主朝鲜、罗马尼亚和印度等国代表支持瑞典提出的把问题交回常设委员会的提案。但是，南朝鲜、菲律宾和某些拉丁美洲国家代表坚持支持美国提案。
    会议决定就中国、瑞典、美国和瑞士代表团提出的全部四个提案进行表决。
    会议首先表决瑞士提案。瑞士提案要求，参加国际红十字大会的邀请要发给对“适用日内瓦公约的领土行使权力的”一切政府，“不论这些政府是否得到其他签字国的承认”。
    瑞士提案以七十九票通过，投赞成票的国家中包括美国、菲律宾、南朝鲜以及某些拉丁美洲国家。
    中华人民共和国的政府和红十字会代表团反对瑞士所提出的提案。反对瑞士提案的二十九票中还有苏联和其他社会主义国家。
    十四票弃权，其中包括印度、埃及、联合王国等。
    波兰政府代表对瑞典提案提出了修正案。他建议把其他三个提案全部交回常设委员会。这个修正案以四十五票赞成对五十三票反对被否决。
    瑞典提案被否决。五十七票反对，其中包括美国等国。四十六票赞成，其中包括印度、苏联和缅甸。十八票弃权，其中包括中国。
    有政府代表和红十字会代表参加大会的国家可投两票。有些国家只有政府代表团参加，因此只有一票可投。
    新华社新德里6日电　国际红十字大会全体会议6日下午决定推迟到7日下午考虑中国和美国的提案，作为大会议程中的最后一个项目。这项决定是根据巴西红十字会提出的动议作出的。
    由于美国提出的要使蒋介石集团分子参加会议提案，大会面临着分裂的危险，印度和其它国家代表团曾屡次表示它们反对美国的提案。
    印度代表考尔再一次对大会说，美国的提案是不合议事规则的。她表示，如果美国提案被通过的话，东道国将不能同会议进行合作。其他许多代表也要求推迟讨论。
    在大会休会一小时的时候，理事会举行了会议，把这个问题列为大会最后一个项目。然后，会议按原定议程继续进行。
