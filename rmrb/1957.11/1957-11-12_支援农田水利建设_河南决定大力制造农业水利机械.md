Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 11th: Henan Province's local machinery industry departments have decided to vigorously manufacture agricultural water conservancy machinery to support farmland irrigation construction.

Recently, the local machinery industry departments of Henan Province held a meeting. Representatives from various farm implement factories and handicraft production cooperatives proposed at the meeting to produce more than 113,000 various waterwheels in 1958, and to manufacture a large number of gas engines, boiler-camel machines, water pumps, and well drilling tools to meet the needs of expanding the province's irrigated area by 20 million mu next year. The repair and maintenance work of existing waterwheels, pumping machines, etc., should also be further strengthened in the future.

The meeting focused on analyzing the new situation in which the upsurge of rural water conservancy construction has arrived throughout the province, and the relationship between this situation and the local machinery industry. The meeting also studied the source of raw materials (mainly pig iron) and unanimously criticized the idea of ​​solely relying on national supply. In the future, the province will strive to increase pig iron production and vigorously purchase scrap iron and waste materials. Factories and handicraft production units stated that after returning, they would clean up warehouses, promote advanced experience in saving raw materials, and widely adopt substitutes while ensuring quality.

The meeting also studied how to improve product quality and arrange the production of other agricultural machinery. The participating production units also exchanged experiences in surveying rural needs and other aspects.

    支援农田水利建设
    河南决定大力制造农业水利机械
    新华社郑州11日电　河南省地方机械工业部门决定大力制造农业水利机械，支援农田水利建设。
    最近，河南省地方机械工业部门举行了会议，各农具厂和手工业生产合作社的代表，在会上提出，要在1958年内，生产各种水车十一万三千多部，并制造大批煤气机、锅驼机、水泵和下泉工具等，以适应明年全省扩大灌溉面积两千万亩的需要。对原有水车、抽水机等的修配工作，今后也要进一步加强。
    这次会议着重分析了目前全省农村水利建设高潮已经到来的新形势，以及这一形势同地方机械工业的关系。会议还就原材料（主要是生铁）的来源问题进行了研究，一致批判了单纯依赖国家供应的思想。今后全省将努力增加生铁产量，大力收购废铁废料。各工厂和手工业生产单位表示回去后就要清理仓库、推广节约原料的先进经验，在保证质量的条件下，广泛采用代用品。
    会议对提高产品质量、安排其他农业机械生产等方面也进行了研究。到会的各生产单位并交流了调查农村需要等方面的经验。
