Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 30th - The Shuangjing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, recently held a large-scale debate on the issue of birth control, and many members now believe that they should have children in a planned way in the future.

The debate was sparked by discussions about grain issues. The cooperative's grain production has increased year by year, but some members' grain consumption levels have not increased accordingly. In the discussion, members found that the population was increasing too quickly. The whole cooperative increased by 52 people last year, requiring more than 31,000 jin of grain, which would require an average increase of 27 jin per mu to cover the expenditure. However, there is a custom of early marriage and multiple births here, and this problem has not attracted everyone's attention in the past. In recent years, with the improvement of life, this custom has developed even further. Many people believe that "early planting of rice seedlings, early harvesting of grain, and early birth of sons means early enjoyment." Older people encourage their children to marry early, and young people are eager to get married as soon as they reach the prescribed age. When the government promoted birth control, many people had ideological resistance. During the period of great blooming and contending, some people even raised opinions saying that "the government even wants to control how many children we have," expressing great dissatisfaction.

On October 26, the Shuangjing Cooperative specifically held a debate on the issue of birth control, debating "whether birth control is good or not." People actively participated. The first speaker, Zhou Keren, said: "It's terrible not to practice birth control. I've added four since liberation, and I'm going to have another one next year. With more children, I can barely afford to feed them, let alone clothe them. I joined the cooperative the year before last, and I distributed more than 400 jin of grain last year, but it was all used up by adding a child, and now I still owe 39 yuan. With more children, life can't be improved, and my wife and I have quarreled many times." At the meeting, everyone calculated the detailed account of population increase, and everyone was shocked after the calculation. Everyone felt that how much more grain would have to be produced each year to be enough to eat if this continued? How much surplus grain would be left to sell to the state to support industrial construction? Then, everyone discussed the disadvantages of having too many children. Zhou Yixuan, who had given birth to six children, said: "With too many children, taking care of the children interferes with production. Sometimes when I come back from work, the children have no one to take care of them and fall and break their heads. Last year, I only did more than 200 work points, while those with fewer children did more than 1,000 work points." Many people also cited examples of excessive childbearing, harm to the mother's health, and weakened children's bodies. Most members believe that children should be born in a planned way. Some people also criticized the idea of "early birth of children means early enjoyment." They said that with the cooperative, hard work can improve life, and running the cooperative well is more reliable than anything else. They believe that the government's promotion of birth control is precisely a concern for our production and life. After the debate, some people who had ideological resistance to birth control also changed their views. Member Chen Maohua already had three children, and thought it was not too many, and was unwilling to listen to the promotion of contraception. This time he said at the meeting that he would take the lead in contraception. Young people such as Hu Xianbin also proposed on the spot to marry later and concentrate on production.

Some members complained that contraception was troublesome. After discussion, everyone felt that a little trouble was better than the big trouble caused by excessive childbearing. Some members also suggested strengthening the promotion of birth control in rural areas, improving the supply of contraceptives, and hoping that hospitals could come up with simpler and more economical contraceptive methods.

### 孩子多既影响生产又影响生活  双井农业社辩论节育大有收获

    孩子多既影响生产又影响生活
    双井农业社辩论节育大有收获
    新华社成都30日电　四川省内江县双井农业生产合作社最近就节制生育问题展开了大辩论，许多社员都认为今后应该有计划地生育子女。
    这次辩论是在讨论粮食问题时引起的。社里粮食年年增产，可是有些社员粮食消费水平却没有相应提高。社员们在讨论中发现原来是人口增加太快，全社去年一年就增加五十二人，需要消费粮食三万一千多斤，要平均每亩多增产二十七斤才够开支。但这里有早婚多生子的风气，这个问题过去并未引起大家注意。近几年，生活有了改善，这种风气更有了发展，许多人认为“早栽秧，早打谷，早生儿子早享福”。老年人鼓励儿女早婚，青年人也是刚满规定年龄就急忙结婚。政府宣传节制生育时，不少人思想有抵触。在大鸣大放中，有人还提出意见说“政府连我们生多少娃娃也要管”，表示很不满意。
    10月26日，双井社专门召开了节育问题辩论会，辩论“节制生育到底好不好”。参加的人很踊跃。第一个发言的周克仁说：“不节育不得了，我解放后就添了四个，明年还要生一个。娃娃多了，顾吃顾不了穿。前年入社，去年多分了四百多斤粮食，可是添个娃娃就用得精光，现在还欠三十九元债。娃娃多了，生活提不高，老婆和我吵过好多架。”在会上，大家都算起人口增加的细账来，算到后来都很吃惊。大家感到，这样下去一年要增产多少粮食才够吃？那还有多少余粮卖给国家支援工业建设？接着，全场你一句我一句议论起孩子过多的害处来。生过六个孩子的周仪宣说：“娃娃一多，照顾娃娃就照顾不了生产。有时做活回来，娃娃没人照应跌得头破血流。去年我只做了二百多个工分，娃娃少的人却做了一千多个工分。”许多人还列举了生育过多、母亲健康受损害、孩子身体衰弱的事例。大多数社员都认为应该有计划地生育子女。有些人还批评了“早生子早享福”的思想。他们说，有了合作社，勤劳动就能改善生活，把合作社办好，比啥都可靠。他们认为，政府提倡节育正是关心我们的生产和生活。经过辩论，有些对节育在思想上有抵触的人也改变自己的看法。社员陈茂华已经有三个孩子，还以为不算多，宣传避孕不愿听。这次他在会上表示要带头避孕。青年胡显彬等也当场提出要晚些结婚，集中精力搞生产。
    有些社员嫌避孕麻烦。经过争论，大家感到有点小麻烦还是比生育过多带来大麻烦好。有些社员还建议在农村加强节育的宣传；改进避孕药物的供应工作；并希望医院能想出更简便经济的避孕办法。
