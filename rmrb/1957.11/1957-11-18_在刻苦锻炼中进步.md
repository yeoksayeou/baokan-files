Progress Through Hard Training
Yù Zhōng

    Yesterday, Zheng Fengrong, with her uniquely elastic, supple, fast, and powerful leg and waist movements, effortlessly and deftly jumped over the 1.77-meter high bar, breaking the women's high jump world record.

    Zheng Fengrong is only twenty years old this year, and it is truly remarkable that she has achieved such good results in high jump. She loved sports since she was a child, often competing in high jump with her younger brother.

    In 1953, she was selected into the Shandong Provincial Track and Field Team and participated in the National Games. In her first "expedition," she achieved a result of 1.36 meters, only four centimeters short of the then national record, which made her very happy.

    In that year, she was admitted to the Beijing Institute of Physical Education. There, she began systematic, step-by-step, and comprehensive physical training. Her performance quickly improved to 1.45 meters. However, later, she suffered a leg injury during long jump practice, which caused severe arthritis.

    By the time her health was fully restored, two years had passed. Returning to the track and field, she could not jump over 1.40 meters. Facing difficulties, she became discouraged and planned to give up high jump and switch to javelin. Later, with the encouragement and help of her teachers and classmates, she realized that this was a weak manifestation of bowing to difficulties. She eliminated her erroneous thoughts, mustered her courage, and resolutely embarked on the path of arduous training again.

    On the road to advancement, she encountered new difficulties. Originally, the style she used for high jump was the outdated straddle technique. So she began to switch to the scissors technique. However, changing styles was not an easy task, because it could lead to a decrease in performance. The fact proved that her performance did decline, but she was not discouraged. She felt that the people around her were supporting and encouraging her. Following her teacher's advice, she practiced with enthusiasm, again and again. Every day, in addition to comprehensive training in ball games, gymnastics, and track and field, she also practiced high jump about a hundred times, while also using various auxiliary movements to correct her high jump action.

    Her performance gradually rose from 1.40 meters. This summer, she achieved excellent results in East Germany—1.72 meters. At the National Track and Field Championships held at the Wutaishan Stadium in Nanjing in October this year, she jumped over 1.73 meters, and a few days later, she jumped over 1.74 meters in Shanghai. None of these achievements went to her head. She made a promise to create a new world record for the motherland. On November 3rd, she jumped over 1.75 meters in Beijing. Today, her wish has finally come true. Now she has jumped over a height of 1.77 meters, breaking the world record of 1.76 meters set by American Black athlete Mildred McDaniel in Melbourne on December 1st last year. She has won honor for the motherland and written a glorious page in the history of track and field in the motherland.

    在刻苦锻炼中进步
    毓忠
    昨天，郑凤荣以她那种特具的弹性、柔软、快速、有力的腿和腰的动作，轻松利落地跳过了1．77公尺高的横竿，打破了女子跳高世界纪录。
    郑凤荣今年才二十岁，在跳高上取得这样好的成绩，真不简单。她从小就喜欢运动，经常和小弟弟在一起比赛跳高。
    到1953年，她被选入了山东省田径代表队，参加了全国运动会，第一次“出征”，她就获得了1．36公尺的成绩，这个成绩与当时全国最高纪录仅差四公分，这使她非常高兴。
    这一年，她考进了北京体育学院。在那里她开始了系统的按步就班的全面的身体锻炼。成绩很快地就提高到了1．45公尺。但是后来，她却因练习跳远腿部受伤引起了严重的关节炎。
    等到她的健康全部恢复时，两年已经过去了。重新回到田径场上，她怎么也不能跳过1．40公尺的高度。面对着困难，她曾经变得消极起来，她打算不练跳高了，要改练标枪。后来经过老师和同学的鼓励和帮助，她认识到这是向困难低头的一种软弱的表现，她消除了错误的思想，鼓足了勇气，毅然地又踏上了艰苦锻炼的路程。
    在前进的道路上，她又遇到了新的困难。原来她跳高用的姿势是落后的跨越式。于是她开始改跳剪刀式。但是改换姿势并不是一件轻而易举的事情，因为弄不好成绩还会降低。事实证明她的成绩确实又降低了，但她并不灰心，她觉得周围的人都在支持她鼓励她，她依照着老师的话，一股热情地一次又一次地进行练习。每天她除了要进行球类、体操、田径等项目的全面锻炼外，还要进行一百次左右的跳高练习，同时还利用各种各样的辅助动作来纠正跳高动作。
    她的成绩从1．40公尺逐渐上升，今年夏季，她在民主德国创造了优异的成绩——1．72公尺。今年10月在南京五台山体育场举行的全国田径运动会上，她跳过了1．73公尺，几天之后又在上海跳过了1．74公尺。所有这些成绩，都没有冲昏她的头脑，她立下了诺言要为祖国创造新的世界纪录。就在11月3日她在北京又跳过了1．75公尺。到今天她的愿望终于实现了。现在她已跳过了1．77公尺的高度，打破了美国黑人运动员麦克丹尼尔在去年12月1日在墨尔本创造的1．76公尺的世界纪录。她为祖国获得了荣誉，为祖国的田径史写上了光辉的一页。
