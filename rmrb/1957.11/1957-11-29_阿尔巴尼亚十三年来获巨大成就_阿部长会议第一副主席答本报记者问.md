    地拉那, November 28th (By our correspondent) November 29th is the 13th anniversary of the liberation of Albania. On the eve of the holiday, our reporter interviewed Comrade Gogo Nushi, member of the Political Bureau of the Albanian Labour Party and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The questions and answers between Comrade Gogo Nushi and the reporter are as follows:

    Q: What achievements have the Albanian people made in developing industry in the thirteen years since liberation?

    A: In the thirteen years, under the wise leadership of the Labour Party of Albania and with the generous assistance of socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, our people have made great achievements in developing the economy and culture. Before the establishment of the people's government, Albania was the most backward country in Europe from an economic and cultural point of view. With the victory of the people's revolution, the old relations of production were overthrown, and important reforms such as the elimination of foreign privileges and the nationalization of industry were implemented. The victorious completion of the Two-Year Plan (1949-1950) and the First Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) transformed Albania from a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country, with socialist industry playing a leading role in the national economy. Investment in national industrialization has been enormous over the past thirteen years, reaching 8.35 billion leks in the First Five-Year Plan alone. Dozens of joint enterprises and factories have been built, all equipped with the most modern machinery imported from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Due to the victorious completion of the tasks set by the Second and Third Congresses of the Albanian Labour Party, which guided our country towards socialist industrialization, industrial production in 1957 increased by about fourteen times compared to 1938, with an average production of 14,000 leks per person. Industry accounts for 47% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. The production of consumer goods in 1957 increased by 14.3 times compared to 1938, and cotton fabrics increased by more than 52.6 times. Before liberation, there was no sugar industry, but now the sugar production can meet the entire needs of the people. The Party and the government pay special attention to the development of mining, especially the oil industry. Coal production in 1957 increased by 63.8 times compared to 1938, aluminum by 22.8 times, and crude oil by 3.4 times. Calculated per capita, the production of coal, aluminum, copper, and crude oil has exceeded that of Greece and Italy since 1955.

    Q: What achievements have the Albanian people made in agriculture and animal husbandry, especially in collectivization? What measures have the Party and the government taken to increase agricultural production?

    A: In the thirteen years, considerable investment has been made in the development of agriculture, amounting to 2.75 billion leks in the First Five-Year Plan alone. Previously, our farmers used primitive wooden plows to cultivate the land, but by the end of this year, the number of tractors will increase from 30 in 1938 to more than 1,900 (calculated at 15 horsepower), and there will be about 2,000 combine harvesters, seeders, and threshers. Due to the implementation of the instructions of the Third Congress of the Albanian Labour Party, agricultural collectivization has reached a climax in the past two years. By the end of October this year, the cultivated land owned by agricultural cooperatives accounted for 56.3% of the country's total cultivated land. Adding the land in the state-owned sector, the socialist component of agriculture accounts for 58.9% of the country's total cultivated land. Agricultural production and cultivated land area are also increasing and expanding. Compared with 1938, the total agricultural production increased by 84%, of which grain increased by 96%, and the cultivated land area increased by 78%, of which grain increased by 50% and cotton by 75.4%. Although one-third of the livestock industry suffered losses during the national liberation war, major achievements have also been made in the development of animal husbandry due to the effective measures taken by the Party and the people's government.

    Q: How does the Albanian Labour Party care for the development of education and culture and the improvement of the people's living standards?

    A: Continuously improving the material and cultural level of the working masses is the main task of our Party and government. Due to the development and improvement of industrial and agricultural production, the supply of national daily necessities is improving day by day. Compared with 1950, the amount of sugar obtained by the people from socialist commercial sectors increased by 64%, edible oil by 129%, beans and rice by 93%, fish and meat by 73%, cotton fabrics by 109%, and footwear by 193%. Due to the continuous growth of industrial and agricultural production, the rationing system was completely abolished in early November this year. National income is an important indicator of the improvement of people's material living standards. From 1950 to 1955, it increased by nearly 70%, and in 1960 it will increase by 53% compared to 1955. During the First Five-Year Plan, the actual wages of workers increased by 20%, and the income of farmers increased by 30%. By 1960, their income will increase relatively by 30% and 38%. In order to create better conditions for the working people, the state built more than 450,000 square meters of housing in cities and production centers and 17,000 new houses in rural areas during the First Five-Year Plan. In the Second Five-Year Plan, in addition to those built by the farmers themselves, 630,000 square meters of housing will be built in cities and production centers. In terms of education and culture, illiteracy among people under the age of 40 has been eliminated. In 1938, there were only 654 primary and secondary schools with 58,000 students, while in the 1956-1957 academic year, there were 2,624 primary, secondary, and universities with 293,000 students. Free education and compulsory education in seven-year primary schools have been implemented in Albania. The state has also set up scholarships in secondary and universities. This year, a national university with six faculties was established in Tirana. In terms of culture and art, our country has also made remarkable progress, and theaters such as opera, dance, puppet theaters, and opera and dance troupes, variety theaters, etc. have been established. The number of cinemas, clubs, libraries, and reading rooms has also increased considerably. The government has consistently cared for the people's health work. Before liberation, 50% of the country's population suffered from malaria, and some areas reached 90%, but today malaria has been basically eliminated. In 1938, there were only eight medical institutions with 820 beds, while in 1957 there were 124 medical institutions with 6,966 beds.

    Q: What are your long-term plans for further developing the national economy?

    A: After victoriously developing our national economy in the First Five-Year Plan, we are now carrying out the Second Five-Year Plan from 1956 to 1960. Its basic task is to further develop industry, especially mining, primarily on the basis of fully utilizing existing production capacity and inherent potential. Transform agricultural production on a socialist basis first, and rapidly develop agriculture to further improve and raise the material and cultural level of the Albanian people. According to this plan, by 1960, the total industrial and agricultural production will reach 169% of that in 1955, with industrial production at 192% and agricultural production at 150%. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the total investment will reach 127% of that in the First Five-Year Plan. Thanks to the enthusiastic labor of our people and the help of the Soviet Union, conditions have been created to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. With the help of technically proficient Soviet experts, the long-term plan for 1961-1967, which is expected to greatly develop the mining industry, has begun to be formulated this year. Our agriculture will be further mechanized, all swamps will be drained, and fruit crops will be further developed. At the same time, economic sectors such as transportation will also be developed accordingly, and Albania will become a country with a trade surplus.

    阿尔巴尼亚十三年来获巨大成就
    阿部长会议第一副主席答本报记者问
    本报地拉那28日电　11月29日，是阿尔巴尼亚解放十三周年纪念日，在节日的前夕，本报记者访问了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党政治局委员、部长会议第一副主席果·努什同志，果·努什同志和记者的问答如下：
    问：解放十三年以来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在发展工业方面取得了哪些成就？
    答：十三年来我国人民在劳动党英明的领导下，在社会主义阵营各国，特别是苏联的慷慨援助下，在发展经济和文化方面已取得了巨大成就。人民政权建立以前，从经济和文化观点来说，阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲最落后的国家。随着人民革命的胜利，旧有的生产关系被推翻了，首先是消灭了外国特权，实行了像土改、工业国有化等的重要改革。两年计划（1949至1950）和第一个五年计划（1951至1955）的胜利完成，使阿尔巴尼亚由落后的农业国变成为工业农业国，出现了在国民经济中起着领导作用的社会主义工业。十三年中，国家工业化的投资是巨大的，仅在第一个五年计划中，就达到了八十三亿五千万里克，建立起几十个联合企业和工厂，这些工厂都是用从苏联和人民民主国家运来的最现代化的机器装备起来的。由于胜利地完成了引导我国走向社会主义工业化的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第二次和第三次代表大会所规定的任务，1957年的工业生产比1938年增加了十四倍左右，平均为每个人生产了一万四千里克。工业占工农业总产值47％，1957年消费品的生产比1938年增加了十四点三倍，棉织品增加了五十二点六倍强。解放前从来没有制糖业，而现在糖的产量已可以满足人民的全部需要。党和政府特别关心矿业，尤其是石油工业的发展。1957年煤的生产比1938年增多了六十三点八倍，铝二十二点八倍，原油三点四倍。按人口平均计算，从1955年起，煤、铝、铜和原油的生产就超过了希腊和意大利。
    问：阿尔巴尼亚人民在农业和畜牧业，特别是在合作化方面获得了哪些成就？党和政府在提高农业生产上采取了哪些措施？
    答：十三年中，在发展农业上进行了十分可观的投资，仅在第一个五年计划内，就投资了二十七亿五千万里克。以前我国农民是用原始木犁来耕种的，而到今年年底拖拉机将从1938年的三十台增加到一千九百台以上（以十五马力计算），并且已有二千台左右的联合收割机、播种机和打谷机等。由于执行了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会的指示，在最近两年中，农业合作化达到了高潮，到今年10月底，农业合作社拥有的耕地面积已占全国耕地面积的56．3％，加上国营部门的土地，社会主义成分的农业，已占全国耕地面积的58．9％。农业生产和耕地面积也在提高和扩大，以1957年和1938年相比，农业总生产增长了84％，其中粮食增长96％，而耕地面积共增长了78％，其中粮食增长50％，棉花75．4％。虽然在民族解放战争期间三分之一的畜牧业遭受了损失，由于党和人民政权采取了有效措施，在发展畜牧业方面也获得了重大的成就。
    问：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是怎样关怀教育和文化的发展和改善人民生活福利的？
    答：不断提高劳动群众物质和文化水平，是我们党和政府的主要任务。由于工农业生产的发展和提高，国民日用品的供应正在日益改善。以1957年和1950年相比，人民从社会主义商业部门获得的食糖增加了64％，食油129％，豆类和大米93％，鱼肉73％，棉织品109％，鞋类193％。由于工农业生产的不断增长，今年11月初已全部取消配给制度。国民收入是人民物质水平改善的重要指标，从1950年到1955年，就增长将近70％，而1960年又将比1955年增长53％。在第一个五年计划中，工人的实际工资增加了20％，农民的收入增加30％，到1960年他们的收入将相对地增加30％和38％。为了给劳动人民创造更好的条件，在第一个五年计划中，国家在城市和生产中心建筑了四十五万多平方公尺的住宅，在农村中建筑了一万七千所新住宅，而在第二个五年计划中，除农民自己建筑的以外，将在城市和生产中心建筑六十三万平方公尺的住宅。在教育和文化方面，已经消灭了四十岁以下的文盲。1938年仅有六百五十四所中、小学校，有五万八千名学生，而在1956—1957学年中，已有二千六百二十四所小、中、大学校，有二十九万三千名学生。在阿尔巴尼亚已实行了免费教育和小学七年制学校的义务教育，在中、大学校中，国家并设置了助学金，今年在地拉那成立了拥有六个系的国立大学。在文化和艺术方面，我国也获得显著的进步，成立了歌舞木偶等剧院和歌舞团杂剧场等。电影院、俱乐部、图书馆和阅览室的数字也有了可观的增长。政府一贯关怀着人民的保健工作，解放以前，全国50％的人患过疟疾，有些地区曾到达90％，而今天已基本消灭了疟疾。1938年只有八个医疗机构，八百二十张病床，而1957年已有一百二十四个医疗机构，六千九百六十六张病床。
    问：你们进一步发展国民经济的远景计划是什么？
    答：在胜利地发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划之后，我们正进行1956至1960年的第二个五年计划，它的基本任务是：首先在全部动用现有的生产能力和内在潜力的基础上，进一步发展工业，特别是矿业。在社会主义基础上首先改组农业生产，迅速发展农业，以进一步改善和提高阿尔巴尼亚人民的物质和文化水平。根据这个计划，到1960年工农业总生产将达到1955年的169％，其中工业生产为192％，农业生产为150％。在第二个五年计划期间，投资总额将要达到第一个五年计划的127％。由于我国人民热情的劳动和苏联的帮助，创造了提前完成第二个五年计划的条件。在精通技术的苏联专家的帮助下，从今年起开始制订1961至1967年远景计划预计，将大大发展矿工业。我国的农业将进一步机械化，将要干涸所有的沼地和进一步发展水果作物。同时，还要相应地发展运输等经济部门，阿尔巴尼亚将要成为一个出超的国家。
