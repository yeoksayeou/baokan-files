How to Open a Socialist Education Course
The CCP Central Committee Approves the Plan Drafted by the Central Propaganda Department

(Reported by this newspaper) The 22nd issue of "Study" magazine published the CCP Central Committee's "Instructions on the Central Propaganda Department's Report on Establishing Socialist Education Courses" and the Central Propaganda Department's report, and also published the "Socialist Education Course Reading Materials" catalog.

The full text of the CCP Central Committee's instructions is as follows: To the Party committees of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, all departments of the Central Committee, the Party groups of state organs and people's organizations, and the General Political Department:

The Central Committee agrees with the Central Propaganda Department's plan for establishing socialist education courses in universities and Party schools. It is hoped that all localities will adopt it, and it is recommended that the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education adopt this plan and propose implementation measures based on specific circumstances.

The Central Committee, November 1, 1957

The full text of the Central Propaganda Department's report is as follows: To the Central Committee:

It is now necessary to establish socialist education courses in universities and Party schools at or above the intermediate level in order to transform the old ideas of intellectuals and raise the socialist consciousness of students. All Party cadres above the intermediate level, leading cadres and intellectuals in state organs, the military, and enterprises should also be organized to study at appropriate times. We believe that, according to the principle of combining theory with practice, this course should take Comrade Mao Zedong's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as the central teaching material, while also reading some necessary classic works of Marxism-Leninism, Party documents, and other documents. According to this proposal, we have compiled a catalog of reading materials (important documents published in the future should also be included).

Study methods: Documents should be studied carefully, and free and full discussions should be conducted. Teachers and tutors should, under the leadership of the Party committee, first organize their own study, understand the basic content of the documents, and closely integrate with the ideological situation of the students to conduct lectures and tutoring. The tendency of political teachers in the past to not pay attention to the ideological situation of students must be resolutely corrected. In order to teach this course well, the Party committees of provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, universities, and state organs must pay attention to training teachers and tutors and give them the necessary assistance. Each provincial and municipal-level Party committee should directly grasp the teaching situation of one or two universities regarding this course and regularly organize research and exchange of teaching experience. We believe that the central and provincial/municipal/autonomous region education administrative departments should strengthen their work in this area under the leadership of the Party committee. The Central Propaganda Department is also prepared to strengthen its work in these areas.

We believe that this course in universities can be taught within one academic year. If the time is insufficient, the minimum number of reading materials can be reduced, or it can be extended to two academic years.

Central Propaganda Department, October 21, 1957

    怎样开设社会主义教育课程
    中共中央批示同意中宣部拟订的方案
    本报讯　第22期“学习”杂志刊载了中共中央对中央宣传部“关于设立社会主义教育课程的报告的批示”和中共中央宣传部的报告，还刊载了“社会主义教育课程阅读文件”目录。
    中共中央的批示全文如下：各省、市、自治区党委，中央各部门，国家机关和人民团体各党组，总政治部：
    同意中央宣传部关于高等学校和党校设立社会主义教育课程的方案。望各地采用，并建议高等教育部和教育部采用这个方案，根据具体情况，提出执行的办法。　　　　　中央　一九五七年十一月一日
    中共中央宣传部的报告全文如下中央：
    高等学校和中级以上的党校，现在都有必要设立社会主义教育的课程，以便改造知识分子的旧思想，提高学员的社会主义觉悟。全党中级以上干部，国家机关、军队和企业的主要干部和知识分子，也应该在适当时间内组织学习。我们认为，根据理论和实际相结合的方针，这个课程应该以毛泽东同志的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”为中心教材，同时阅读一些必要的马克思列宁主义经典著作、党的文件和其他文件。按照这样的拟议，我们试编了一个阅读文件目录（今后发表的有关重要文件，也应该继续列入）。
    学习的方法：应该精读文件，又进行自由的和充分的讨论。教员和辅导员，应该在党委的领导下，首先组织自己的学习，理解文件的基本内容，密切结合学员的思想情况，进行讲授和辅导。过去政治课教员对于学员思想情况不加过问的偏向，必须坚决纠正。为了使这一课程教好，省、市、自治区、高等院校和国家机关等党委，都必须注意培养教员和辅导员，给他们以必要的帮助。每个省、市一级党委，都应该直接掌握一个或两个高等院校关于这一个课程的教学情况，经常组织教学经验的研究和交流。我们认为中央和省、市、自治区教育行政部门应该在党委的领导下，加强这一方面的工作。中央宣传部也准备加强在这些方面的工作。
    我们认为，高等院校中这一课程，可以在一个学年内教完。如果感到时间不足，可以把最低限度的阅读文件加以减少，也可以延长到两个学年。
            中央宣传部　一九五七年十月二十一日
