Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 14th: U.S. President Eisenhower delivered another speech on November 13th, titled “National Security.” In this speech, delivered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, he advocated that the United States must greatly increase military spending to intensify the nuclear arms race.

This is the second speech the U.S. President has delivered within a week since the launch of the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite.

In his new speech, he further put forward the "four main tasks" for the United States to accelerate the expansion of armaments, which are: First, as a so-called "major deterrent force," "must maintain a sufficiently large atomic retaliatory force"; second, "in cooperation with America's allies, establish a very flexible military organization"; third, "maintain domestic defense in a highly efficient state"; fourth, "have reserve forces to cope with unexpected emergency requirements."

Eisenhower said that in order to implement such an arms expansion plan, "it will require taxes, a lot of taxes." He believes that the Soviet Union's scientific achievement in launching satellites makes the United States "should once again seriously re-examine its entire defense posture." He said that the "most urgent actions that must be paid attention to" are to keep its strategic air force "in a state of maximum strength" and accelerate the dispersal of these strategic air forces to "additional bases," as well as to develop missile power. To do all this "requires additional expenditure."

Eisenhower also talked about the United States' satellite program, which is also considered from a military perspective, and this will also "require huge amounts of funding."

He also mentioned that measures must be taken to "strengthen" American science education and basic research.

    借着苏联人造卫星鼓吹实力政策
    艾森豪威尔叫嚣扩张核军备
    据新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔11月13日又发表了一篇题目是所谓“国家安全”的演说。他在俄克拉何马州的俄克拉何马市发表的这篇演说中，鼓吹美国必须大大增加军事开支，来加紧进行核军备竞赛。
    这是美国总统在苏联第二颗人造卫星发射以来连续在一个星期里发表的第二篇演说。
    他在新的一篇演说里又进一步提出了美国加紧扩张军备的“四项主要任务”，它们是：一、作为一种所谓“主要威慑力量”，“必须保持足够大的原子核报复力量”；二、“在和美国的盟国的合作下，建立一个十分灵活的军事组织”；三、“把美国国内防御保持在高度有效率的状态中”；四、“具有后备力量以应付意外的紧急要求”。
    艾森豪威尔说，为了执行这样一个扩军计划，“就需要税款，很多的税款”。他认为苏联发射卫星的科学成就使美国“应该再一次严重地重新研究它的整个防御地位”。他说，目前美国
  “必须最迫切地注意的行动”就是要使它的战略空军“继续处于最大限度的实力状态之中”和加速把这些战略空军分散到“额外的基地上去”，以及发展导弹力量。而要作到这些，“就需要额外的开支”。
    艾森豪威尔还谈到美国的也是从军事角度考虑的卫星计划，这也将“需要巨额的经费”。
    他还谈到，必须采取措施来“加强”美国的科学教育和基本研究工作。
