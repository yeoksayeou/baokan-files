Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 4th -- Staff at the Zijinshan Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have tensely begun observation work on the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite. They held a meeting on the morning of the 4th, where they estimated the possible time of appearance of the satellite, concentrated and checked telescopes and other instruments, and decided that all personnel would be divided to listen to the radio signals emitted by the satellite and conduct optical and visual observations. Starting on the evening of the 4th, the observation team will systematically search the sky in sections along the same arc, and try to photograph artificial earth satellites and determine the artificial earth satellite's azimuth, altitude, and transit time.

More than eighty teachers and students from the Mathematics and Astronomy Department of Nanjing University volunteered to participate in signal reception and satellite observation work, forming four observation groups, with teachers and students who have more observational experience serving as the group leaders and deputy group leaders, observing in shifts from the evening of the 4th.

    南京天文工作者正在紧张地观测卫星
    据新华社南京4日电　中国科学院紫金山天文台的工作人员紧张地开始了苏联第二颗人造卫星的观测工作。他们在4日晨举行了会议，在会上估算了卫星可能出现的时刻，集中和检查了望远镜和其他仪器，决定由全体人员分工收听卫星发射的无线电讯号，进行光学和目视观测。观测队从4日晚开始，将对天空有计划地在同一弧线上分区搜索，并设法拍摄人造地球卫星照片和测定人造地球卫星的方位、高度和飞过的时间。
    南京大学数学天文系的教师和学生八十多人自愿参加讯号收听和卫星观测工作，组成了四个观测组，由对观测较有经验的教师和学生分任正副组长，从4日晚起轮班观测。
