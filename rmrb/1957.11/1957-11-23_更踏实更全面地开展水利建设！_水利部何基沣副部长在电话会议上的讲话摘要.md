Carry out water conservancy construction in a more down-to-earth and comprehensive manner!
    —Excerpts from the speech by Vice Minister He Jifeng of the Ministry of Water Conservancy at a telephone conference

    Currently, a massive and magnificent mass movement for water conservancy construction is unfolding across the country.

    Because agricultural cooperativization already has a foundation of two years, cooperatives are more consolidated, and public accumulation has increased more than before; because the socialist awareness of the peasant masses has been further enhanced through the great debate on the two roads in the countryside; leadership experience is richer, and the strength of cadres has also been greatly strengthened. All of this makes this upsurge have more favorable conditions than the previous water conservancy upsurge.

    Characteristics of this year's water conservancy construction

    The first characteristic of this year's water conservancy upsurge is that the leadership is proactive, has sufficient enthusiasm, starts early, acts quickly, and is relatively well-prepared. As early as after the spring repairs were completed this year, various regions organized forces to carry out surveying, planning, and training of cadres. After the central government issued the decision to carry out water conservancy construction, various regions successively convened meetings and issued instructions. Many regions immediately established unified command organizations for winter and spring repairs, led personally by the first secretary of the Party committee, truly achieving the goal of mobilizing the entire Party and the entire people to undertake water conservancy. According to incomplete statistics, the expansion of irrigation area planned by various provinces has currently reached 90 million mu, an increase of about 50% compared to the control target proposed at the National Rural Work Conference in September. The launch of this year's winter repair movement is generally two or three months earlier than in previous years. According to incomplete statistics from only seven provinces, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Jilin, as of the beginning of November, more than 16 million mu of expanded irrigation area had been completed, accounting for 33% of the annual plan of the seven provinces.

    The second characteristic is that all provinces attach great importance to cultivating typical examples and pay attention to promoting advanced experiences. Over the past few years, various regions have cultivated some good typical examples, such as the transformation of low-lying areas in the Tianjin Special Zone of Hebei Province, the comprehensive management of the Mang River in the Xinxiang Special Zone of Henan Province, the small reservoirs in the Jinhua Special Zone of Zhejiang Province, the cooperative water use in Liling County of Hunan Province, the joint construction and management of ponds and dams in Chaoxian County of Anhui Province, and the soil and water conservation in Daquanshan Mountain of Shanxi Province, etc. This year, in carrying out the work, all regions have fully utilized and promoted these good experiences. After more than a year of efforts, 207 "Daquanshan Mountains" have emerged in the Yanbei Special Zone of Shanxi Province, and it is expected to reach 500 "Daquanshan Mountains" by next spring. Many regions not only pay attention to learning from the experiences of other regions, but also pay great attention to cultivating and discovering good typical examples and experiences in their own regions.

    The third characteristic is that various regions have accepted the lessons of the 1956 movement, pay attention to engineering quality and benefits. Some provinces have proposed "reservoirs completed and canals opened, wells completed and land leveled"; some provinces have proposed "resolutely achieving the goal of repairing one place well, using one place well, and managing one place well"; some provinces have issued regulations on engineering inspection and acceptance. Many regions have transferred a large number of technical cadres to the countryside to strengthen technical guidance for mass water conservancy projects. Judging from the current situation, most regions have the confidence to achieve the requirements of "more, faster, better, and more economical."

    The fourth characteristic is that water conservancy work is closely integrated with the current political movement. The great debate on the two routes in the countryside has become the main driving force for promoting the water conservancy movement. Many regions have proposed debate topics, organized mass discussions in combination with current work and mass ideological understanding. This has a great effect on raising mass awareness, overcoming difficulties, and promoting work. For example, Shanghu Township in Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, solved the problems of "Is it beneficial to carry out water conservancy construction?" and "Rely on the state or rely on the masses?" through the method of combining airing views, debating, and taking action. On the second day after the debate meeting in each cooperative ended, more than 800 people went to work to continue building the two reservoirs that were not completed this spring.

    The fifth characteristic is the close cooperation and active support from all parties. From the central to local levels, whether it is industrial departments, commercial departments, transportation departments, propaganda departments, supervisory departments, or even the army and schools, they all give strong support with great enthusiasm. Commercial departments in various regions are trying their best to find sources of goods to meet the needs of various materials and equipment for water conservancy construction. Troops stationed in Gansu, Jiangxi and other places have also organized forces to help farmers build water conservancy.

    Strengthen specific guidance to overcome imbalances

    The current upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction is developing continuously with an overwhelming momentum. The overall situation of the movement is healthy and smooth. However, in some areas and some works, there are still some problems. According to the recent in-depth inspection by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, the development of the movement is uneven. Seven of the ten special districts in Hebei Province have already taken large-scale action, but the other three special districts have not taken enough action; from the perspective of agricultural cooperatives, most of the cooperatives have taken action, but in some areas, there are still 20% or even 50% of the cooperatives that have not taken action or have not taken enough action. Hebei Province also found during the inspection that some areas focused on the plains and ignored the mountains; focused on irrigation and ignored drainage and soil and water conservation. Individual regions have also experienced casualties and coercive orders. According to inspections in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jilin and other provinces, there are similar situations.

    The main problem at present is the uneven development of the movement. As far as the whole country is concerned, and as far as a province or a county is concerned, the upsurge has already risen, but there are still some areas that are still calm. The reason is that the leadership's thinking has not kept up. Some comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the situation, and therefore still have a certain degree of right-leaning conservative thinking. They either sink all their strength into a few large-scale projects; or they do not actively mobilize and rely on the masses, waiting for the higher authorities to provide money and solutions; or they are uncertain about the policy and swing from side to side; or they simply sit in the office and issue orders, lacking in-depth inspection and specific guidance, resulting in stagnant or slow progress.

    In order to overcome this phenomenon of uneven development, some regions have taken some measures. For example, the leading organs of some provinces have sent responsible comrades to the region to supervise and inspect; or they have organized the staff of regions with slow action to visit advanced regions, and so on.

    How to further strengthen specific guidance is another important issue in the current movement. It is recommended that leading organs at all levels conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of water conservancy work, summarize experience in a timely manner, discover problems, and correct shortcomings. For the problems that have already been discovered in some areas, such as some believe that the state's investment in water conservancy and the accumulation of agricultural cooperatives have increased, and therefore relaxed the implementation of the principle of diligence and frugality in water conservancy; individual regions have experienced coercive orders, waste of labor, and neglect of engineering quality and construction site safety and hygiene, all of which must be taken immediately. Measures should be taken to correct it.

      Several specific issues

    Based on the development of water conservancy construction in the recent stage, we believe that the following specific issues are worth noting.

    First, ensure quality, pay attention to safety, and ensure that the project can play its role in a timely and full manner after it is completed. This requires strengthening specific leadership and technical guidance. According to the lessons learned from water conservancy work in 1956, regardless of the size of the project, it is necessary to conduct in-depth publicity and education on quality and safety before the migrant workers start work, formulate necessary inspection and acceptance systems, construction procedures, and engineering specifications, and enable cadres and the masses participating in the project to understand and master them. In the construction process, we must unremittingly fight against phenomena that ignore quality and safety. Project acceptance should be carried out in stages and phases, and not all at once after the entire project is completed, causing rework and waste. In winter repairs, we should resolutely implement the spirit of "repair, management, and use" as a whole, and achieve "reservoirs completed and canals opened, wells completed and land leveled", "repair one place well, manage one place well, and use one place well".

    Second, while carrying out water conservancy projects, we should vigorously carry out winter irrigation and water storage and conservation work. Since the beginning of autumn this year, rainfall in various regions has been relatively sparse, and drought in North China has been particularly severe. Although vigorous drought resistance and rush planting have been carried out, the wheat planting area in many regions has still not been completed according to plan. At the same time, due to insufficient soil moisture, the wheat fields that have been sown have a serious lack of seedlings, and the wheat seedlings are not growing well. Therefore, wherever there is a water source available, winter irrigation must be carried out extensively and wheat field management must be strengthened. On the other hand, due to the sparse rainfall this year, the river flow in the coming spring may be less than in previous years. In addition to stepping up winter irrigation of wheat, we should also use all available surface and groundwater sources to carry out soil moisture conservation and irrigation of winter fallow land. If conditions permit, we should also use pits, ponds, riverbeds, water cellars, etc. to store water, and strive to reduce the tension of spring irrigation next year.

    Third, in carrying out water conservancy work, we should pay attention to overall planning. The water source situation, the requirements of agricultural production, and the relationship between upstream and downstream, left and right banks should be fully investigated and studied and comprehensively arranged in advance. In the selection of project types, we must pay full attention to adapting to local conditions, and we must not mechanically copy, let alone adopt coercive means to arrange work.

    Fourth, in terms of the supply of materials and equipment, we should adhere to the spirit of diligence and frugality, and rely as much as possible on the masses and local forces to obtain materials and supply them locally. In the use of materials, we must be careful and economical, and use various substitutes as much as possible to reduce the difficulty of material supply.

    Fifth, after a period of time, some areas in Northeast China and North China will enter the freezing period. During that period, in addition to some projects that can be constructed, such as well drilling, water storage and ice cultivation, ice dam construction, and some hydraulic structures that can be carried out in sheds, they should continue to be built. Most provinces across the country that are not affected by wind and freezing should seize the time in December and January to push the water conservancy movement to a new upsurge.

    We believe that with the correct guidance of the Party Central Committee's water conservancy construction policy, the clear direction pointed out by the Agricultural Development Program, the direct leadership of the Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, and the strong support of the people of the whole country, the 500 million farmers who have embarked on the road of cooperativization will once again create miracles on the battle line of fighting against water and drought disasters.

    更踏实更全面地开展水利建设！
    ——水利部何基沣副部长在电话会议上的讲话摘要
    目前，一个声势浩大、规模壮阔的群众性兴修水利运动，正在全国范围内展开。
    由于农业合作化已经有了两年的基础，合作社更巩固了，公共积累较前增多了；由于经过农村两条道路的大辩论，农民群众社会主义觉悟进一步提高了；领导经验更为丰富了，干部力量也大大加强了。这一切就使得这一次高潮比上一次水利高潮具有更有利的条件。
    今年兴修水利的特点
    今年水利高潮的第一个特点，是领导主动、劲头足、动手早、行动快，准备也比较充分。早在今年春修结束以后，各地就组织力量，进行勘测、规划、训练干部等工作。中央兴修水利的决定发布以后，各地相继召开了会议，发出了指示。不少地区都立即成立了冬春修的统一指挥机构，由党委第一书记亲自领导，真正做到了全党动员，全民办水利。据不完全统计，各省扩大灌溉面积计划目前已达九千万亩，比较9月全国农村工作会议所提控制指标，增加50％左右。今年冬修运动的开展，比较往年一般提早了两、三个月。仅据河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西、甘肃、吉林七个省到11月初的不完全统计，已完成扩灌面积一千六百余万亩，占七省年度计划的33％。
    第二个特点是各省都十分重视培养典型，注意推广先进经验。几年来各个地区都培养了一些好典型，例如河北省天津专区的洼地改造，河南省新乡专区漭河的综合治理，浙江省金华专区的小型水库，湖南省醴陵县的合作用水，安徽省巢县的塘坝联合修管，山西省大泉山的水土保持等等。今年各地在开展工作中，都充分利用和推广了这些好的经验。山西省雁北专区经过一年多的努力，已经出现了二百零七个“大泉山”，明年春将达到五百个“大泉山”。很多地区不但注意学习外地的经验，而且十分注意培养、发现本地区好的典型和经验。
    第三个特点是各地接受1956年运动中的教训，注重工程质量和效益，有的省提出“库成渠通，井成地平”；有的省提出“切实作到修好一处，用好一处，管好一处”；有些省颁发了工程检查验收条例。不少地区抽调大批技术干部下乡，加强群众性水利工程的技术指导。从当前的情况看，大部分地区是有信心做到“又多、又快、又好、又省”的要求的。
    第四个特点是水利工作密切结合了当前的政治运动。农村中两条路线的大辩论，成为推动水利运动的主要动力。很多地区结合当前工作和群众思想认识，提出辩论题目，组织群众讨论。这对于提高群众认识，克服困难，推动工作有很大作用。例如浙江省东阳县上湖乡通过边鸣放，边辩论，边行动的方式，解决了“兴修水利有没有好处？”“依靠国家，还是依靠群众？”等问题，在各社辩论会结束的第二天，就有八百多人出工，继续兴修今春没有完成的两座水库。
    第五个特点是各方面的紧密配合和积极支援。从中央到地方不论工业部门、商业部门、运输部门、宣传部门、监察部门以至于部队、学校，都以巨大热情，给以大力支援。各地商业部门正在千方百计寻找货源，满足水利建设各项物资器材的需要。甘肃、江西等地驻军也都纷纷组织力量帮助农民修水利。
    加强具体指导  克服不平衡现象
    当前这个兴修农田水利高潮正在以排山倒海之势向前不断发展，运动总的情况是健康的、是顺利的。但是在部分地区，部分工作中也还存在着一些问题。据最近河北省委下去深入检查，运动的发展是不平衡的，河北省十个专区，有七个已经大规模地行动起来，但是还有三个专区动的不够；从农业社来看，大部分的社都行动起来，但是部分地区还有20％甚至50％的社没有动或者动的不够。河北省在检查中还发现，有的地区抓了平原，忽视了山区；抓了灌溉，忽视了治涝和水土保持。个别地区还发生伤亡事故和强迫命令现象。据江苏、浙江、吉林等省检查，也有类似情况。
    当前的主要问题，是运动发展不平衡。就全国来说，就一省、一县来说，高潮已经起来了，但是还有些地区仍是风平浪静。原因在于领导思想没有跟上去。有些同志对形势认识不足，因而还存在一定程度的右倾保守思想。他们或者是把全部力量陷入几个大型工程；或者是不积极发动依靠群众，坐待上级拿钱拿办法；或者是方针掌握不定，左右摇摆；或者是单纯坐在办公室发号施令，缺乏深入检查，具体指导，以致使工作停滞或进展缓慢。
    为了克服这种发展不平衡的现象，目前有些地区已采取了一些措施。如有的省领导机关派负责同志亲自到地区督促检查；或者组织行动迟缓的地区的工作人员到先进地区参观，等等。
    如何进一步加强具体指导，是当前运动中的另一个重要问题。建议各级领导机关应对水利工作全面地深入地检查，及时总结经验，发现问题，纠正缺点。对目前有些地区已经发现的问题，如有的认为国家对水利的投资和农业合作社的积累，都有所增加，因而放松了对勤俭办水利的方针的贯彻；个别地区发生了强迫命令、浪费劳动力、忽视工程质量和工地安全卫生等现象，都必须立即采取措施加以纠正。
      几个具体问题
    根据最近这个阶段水利建设的发展情况，我们认为以下几个具体问题值得注意。
    一、切实保证质量，注意安全，使工程修好后，及时充分发挥效益。这就必须加强具体领导和技术指导。根据1956年水利工作中的教训，不论工程大小。必须在民工上工之前，深入进行关于质量和安全的宣传教育，制定必要的检查验收制度、施工规程和工程规格，并且使参加工程的干部、群众都能了解掌握。在施工过程中，要坚持不懈地与忽视质量和安全的现象作斗争。工程验收应当是分段分期进行，不可等工程全部完工后再一次进行，造成返工浪费。在冬修中，应当坚决贯彻“修、管、用”三位一体的精神，做到“库成渠通，井成地平”“修好一处，管好一处，用好一处”。
    二、在兴修水利工程的同时，应当大力开展冬灌和蓄水保水工作。今年入秋以来，各地雨量比较稀少，华北地区干旱特别严重，虽然经过大力抗旱抢种，但很多地区麦播面积仍然没有按计划完成。同时由于底墒不够，已播上的麦田，缺苗比较严重，麦苗生长情况也不好。因此，凡是有水源可以利用的地方，一定要广泛进行冬灌，并加强麦田管理。另一方面由于今年雨量稀少，明春河水流量可能较往年为少，除加紧小麦冬灌外；更应当利用现在一切可以利用的地上和地下水源，进行冬闲地的保墒灌溉，有条件的并利用坑塘、河槽、水窖等，将水蓄积起来，力求减轻来年春灌的紧张程度。
    三、在开展水利工作中应当注意全面规划。对于水源情况，农业生产的要求，上下游、左右岸的关系，事先都应当作充分调查研究和统盘安排。在工程类型的选择上，要充分注意因地制宜，不可生搬硬套，更不可采取强迫命令的手段布置工作。
    四、在物资器材的供应方面，应当本着勤俭精神，尽可能依靠群众和地方力量就地取材，就地供应。在物料使用上，一定要精打细算，尽可能采用各种代用品，以减少物资供应的困难。
    五、东北和北方一些地区，再经过一段时间，就要进入冰冻时期，在那个时期中，除一些可以施工的工程，如打井、蓄水养冰、打冰坝以及一些可以在工棚内进行的水工建筑物等，仍应继续兴建。不受风冻影响的全国大部省份，则应抓紧12月和1月时间，把水利运动推向新的高潮。
    我们相信，有党中央的水利建设方针的正确指导，有农业发展纲要指出的明确方向，有中央以及各级党委的直接领导和全国人民的大力支援，已经走上合作化道路的五亿农民，在与水旱灾害作斗争的战线上，是会再度创造奇迹的。
