    Provisional Regulations of the State Council on Vacation and Wage Treatment for Workers and Staff Returning Home to Visit Relatives (Draft)
    (Approved in principle at the 85th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on November 16th, 1957)

    Article 1: These provisional regulations are formulated to appropriately address the issue of home visits for workers and staff who live far from their hometowns and are separated from their families.

    Article 2: Workers and staff who have worked continuously for one year or more in state-owned, jointly state-private owned enterprises, institutions, state organs, and people's organizations, and who do not live with their father, mother, or spouse and cannot use public holidays to reunite with their families, shall in principle be granted leave once a year to return home to visit relatives. The duration of the leave shall be two to three weeks (including public holidays, the same below), depending on the distance. If, due to work needs, the administration cannot grant leave to certain workers and staff in the current year, the approval of the primary trade union organization should be obtained, and four to five weeks of leave should be granted in the next year.

    Workers and staff whose workplaces are too far from their homes and whose round-trip travel time exceeds ten days may be granted leave once every two years, with a duration of five to six weeks. No additional travel time leave will be granted in addition to the aforementioned leave.

    Article 3: The term "returning home to visit relatives" in these regulations refers only to workers and staff returning home to visit their father, mother, and spouse. Workers and staff who already have their father, mother, or spouse living with them at their workplace, or who live close enough to home to reunite with their father, mother, or spouse during public holidays, or who enjoy other continuous paid leave of two weeks or more per year, will no longer be granted home visit leave.

    If both husband and wife work in different locations and cannot reunite during public holidays, even if both have their father and mother living with them at their respective workplaces, one of them shall be allowed to enjoy the benefits of these regulations.

    Article 4: Workers and staff shall be paid wages at their hourly wage standard during their home visit leave.

    Article 5: If the round-trip transportation expenses required for workers and staff returning home to visit relatives exceed one-half of their monthly hourly wage standard (or one-third for those returning home once every two years), the administration shall subsidize one-half of the excess. The calculation of transportation expenses shall be based on the cost of a round-trip ticket for a hard seat on a train (excluding sleeper), a third-class cabin on a ship, a long-distance bus, and folk transportation. The transportation expenses to be subsidized shall be paid from the administrative expenses of the worker or staff's work unit.

    Article 6: The administration of each enterprise, institution, state organ, and people's organization shall, in conjunction with the primary trade union organization, reasonably arrange the home visit leave for workers and staff, ensuring that it does not hinder the normal progress of production and work, and shall not increase personnel staffing as a result.

    Article 7: The People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government may formulate and promulgate implementing rules based on these regulations, which shall be uniformly implemented within their respective province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government. The implementing rules for the railway and shipping systems shall be formulated and promulgated by their respective central competent departments and implemented within their respective responsible areas, and shall be submitted to the Ministry of Labor for record.

    Article 8: These regulations shall also apply to supply and marketing cooperatives, but shall not apply to schools, handicraft production cooperatives, transportation cooperatives, and jointly state-private enterprises with undetermined interest rates.

    Article 9: These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.

    国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定（草案）
    （一九五七年十一月十六日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十五次会议原则批准）第一条　为了适当地解决远离家乡同家属分居
    两地的工人、职员回家探亲的问题，制定本暂行规定。
    第二条　在国营、公私合营的企业、事业单位和国家机关、人民团体中连续工作满一年的工人、职员，凡是同父亲、母亲、配偶都不住在一起而又不能够利用公共休假日回家团聚的，原则上每年给假一次，以便回家探亲。假期根据路程的远近，规定为两个星期至三个星期（包括公共休假日在内，下同）。如果因为工作需要，行政方面对于某些工人、职员当年不能够给予假期，应该取得工会基层组织的同意，在下一个年度合并给假四个星期至五个星期。
    某些工人、职员的工作地点离家太远，旅途往返所需用的时间在十日以上的，可以每两年给假一次，假期为五个星期至六个星期。除了上述假期以外，不另给路程假。
    第三条　本规定所称的回家探亲，只是指工人、职员回家探望父亲、母亲和配偶。凡是在本人工作地点已经有父亲或者母亲或者配偶住在一起的工人、职员，或者离家较近能够利用公共休假日与父亲、母亲、配偶团聚的工人、职员，或者每年享有其他领取工资的连续两个星期以上的假期的工人、职员，都不再给回家探亲假期。
    夫妇双方分别在两地工作而又不能够利用公共休假日团聚的，即使双方在工作地点都已经有父亲、母亲同住，也允许一方享受本规定的待遇。
    第四条　工人、职员回家探亲的假期，按照本人的计时工资标准发给工资。
    第五条　工人、职员回家探亲所需用的往返车船费，超过本人的月计时工资标准的二分之一（两年回家一次的超过三分之一）的时候，由行政方面补助超过部分的二分之一。计算车船费以火车硬席（不包括卧铺）、轮船通舱、长途汽车和民间交通工具往返一次的费用为标准。应该补助的车船费，由工人、职员所在单位的行政管理费内开支。
    第六条　各企业、事业单位和国家机关、人民团体的行政方面应该会同工会基层组织，合理地安排工人、职员回家探亲的假期，务求不妨碍生产和工作的正常进行，并且不得因此而增加人员编制。
    第七条　各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会可以根据本规定制定颁发实施细则，在本省、自治区、直辖市范围内统一执行；铁道、航运系统的实施细则各由其中央主管部门制定颁发，在本部门主管范围内执行，都报送劳动部备案。第八条　本规定同样适用于供销合作社，但是不适用于学校、手工业生产合作社、运输合作社和未定息的公私合营企业。
    第九条　本规定自公布之日起施行。
