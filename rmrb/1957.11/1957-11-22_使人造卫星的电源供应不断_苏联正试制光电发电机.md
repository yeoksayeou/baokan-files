Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 21st: The Soviet Union will install devices that use solar energy to generate electricity on future, heavier artificial satellites. This was stated by Soviet engineer Grigorenko in an article in the "Red Star" on the 20th.

Dry batteries and storage batteries were used as power sources on the two artificial satellites launched by the Soviet Union, but they could not guarantee long-term operation of the instruments. The power supply of the first satellite was exhausted in twenty-four days, and the power supply of the second satellite lasted only seven days and nights.

In order to provide the instruments on the satellite with sufficient power to maintain long-term operation, the Soviet Union is testing a photoelectric generator. It is made of a smooth zinc photosensitive plate coated with a thin layer of silicon. This layer of silicon can convert the solar light energy projected onto it into electric current. The photoelectric generator has an area of only one square meter, but its power generation capacity is 50 watts. A crystal converter can be used to convert the direct current generated by the photoelectric generator into alternating current. The effective efficiency coefficient of this crystal converter is about 90%.

An automatic device can keep the photoelectric generator facing the sun at all times and store the current in a battery for use when the satellite orbits to the dark side of the earth.

The article stated that a thermoelectric generator is also being tested. This generator can convert solar radiation energy into electrical energy with the help of the Seebeck effect. It weighs about 110 to 115 kilograms and has an average power generation capacity of about 100 watts. The use of this generator can also enable the instruments of artificial satellites to operate for a long time.

### 使人造卫星的电源供应不断  苏联正试制光电发电机

    使人造卫星的电源供应不断
    苏联正试制光电发电机
    新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联将在未来的更重的人造卫星上安装利用太阳能来发电的装置。这是苏联工程师格里戈连珂在20日的“红星报”上一篇文章中说的。
    在苏联发射的两个人造卫星上，曾采用干电池和蓄电池作为电源，但它们不能保证仪器的长期工作。第一个卫星的电源用了二十四天就用完了，第二个卫星的电源只用了七昼夜。
    为了使卫星上的仪器有足够的电源来维持长期工作，苏联正在试验一种光电发电机。它由平滑的锌感光板制成，锌板上涂有一层薄的矽。这层矽能把投射在它上面的太阳光能变为电流。光电发电机面积只有一平方公尺，而发电能力为五十瓦。利用晶体变流器可将光电发电机所产生的直流电变为交流电。这种晶体变流器有效作用系数约达90％。
    有一种自动装置能使光电发电机永远向着太阳，还能把电流蓄在电池里，以便在卫里绕行到地球背阴地区时应用。
    文章说，一种热电发电机也在试验中。这种发电机借助温差电偶的作用能将太阳的辐射能变为电能，它重约一百一十到一百一十五公斤，平均发电能力约一百瓦。使用这种发电机也可使人造星卫的仪器能够长期进行工作。
