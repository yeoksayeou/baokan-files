    Party Rightist Shi Jingbo
    Wants Only "Independent Adjudication," Not Party Leadership
    (By this newspaper) Heihejiang Judicial Department Section-level Secretary, Communist Party member, and Rightist Shi Jingbo concentrated his attacks on the Party's leadership over judicial work. He believed that the Party committee’s intervention in cases undermined the legal system and prevented the courts from conducting "independent adjudication."

    He also said that the Provincial Department of Justice had no "three powers." He believed that first, it had no personnel power (no authority to manage cadres); second, it had no financial power (no management of judicial operating expenses); and third, it had no power to decide on work (it could not reverse judgments when errors were discovered). He also advocated: "Public security and procuratorial departments should be under the leadership of judicial administration. The central Ministry of Justice should at least be on par with the State Council and there should also be an organization in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Only in this way will it have power, and only in this way can it encompass the authority of public security and procuratorial departments in the provinces.”

    党内右派分子石敬博
    只要“独立审判”   不要党的领导
    本报讯　黑龙江司法厅科级秘书、共产党员、右派分子石敬博集中攻击了党对司法工作的领导。他认为党委过问案件就是破坏了法制，使法院不能进行“独立审判”。
    他还说什么省司法厅没有“三权”。他认为第一，没有人权（没有干部管理权）；第二，没有财权（没有管理司法事业费）；第三，没有工作决定权（发现错案不能改判）。他还主张：“公安、检察部门都应归司法行政领导。中央司法部起码应与国务院平列，并且也应当在人大常委会设一个组织，这样才有权力，只有这样才能把省的公安、检察权限概括了。”
