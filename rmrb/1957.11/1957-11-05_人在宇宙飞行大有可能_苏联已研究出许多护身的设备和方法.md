Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th -- Soviet Deputy Doctor of Medical Sciences, Erjinma, stated in an article published in the Soviet "Air Force Newspaper" on the 3rd that the Soviet Union has researched and tested many devices and methods to protect the human body during space flight, including high-altitude suits with oxygen equipment and vacuum diving suits. These suits can create a certain pressure on the body and provide sufficient oxygen.

During space flight, animals are in a weightless state for a long period. According to experiments done with rockets, animals exhibited motor ataxia when losing weight. For example, turtles could not grasp food near them, and white mice exhibited the most unusual postures. With multiple flights in a weightless state, animals can gradually get used to it. However, it is not yet known whether humans can get used to long periods of weightless spaceflight. Conducting flight experiments with animals on artificial satellites can further study this issue.

The article also discussed other issues related to spaceflight. It said that the Soviet Union has researched methods of using television to record animal heart activity and breathing during spaceflight experiments conducted with rockets. Each time an animal's heart contracts, a small amount of electricity is generated, which can be recorded with special instruments, and the signals can be sent back to Earth with instruments. Cosmic radiation also has a certain impact on the animal's brain nerve center. Preventing the effects of cosmic rays is a very complex issue.

The problem of protecting the safety of animals flying on rockets cannot be solved in the short term. Scientists are studying artificial satellites carrying animals, opening up realistic possibilities for realizing interstellar flight.

    人在宇宙飞行大有可能
    苏联已研究出许多护身的设备和方法
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联医学副博士尔金马3日发表在苏联“空军报”上的一篇文章说，苏联已经研究出和试验了在宇宙飞行时保护人体的许多设备和方法，其中包括带有氧气设备的高空服装和真空潜水服。这种服装能造成对身体的一定的压力，并且供应足够的氧气。
    在宇宙飞行时，动物在长时期内处在没有体重的状态下。根据用火箭所做的试验表明，动物在失掉体重的情况下，出现了运动失调现象。例如乌龟不能抓取身边的食物，白老鼠表现出最不平常的姿态。在没有体重的情况下作多次飞行，动物便能逐渐习惯。但是，现在还不知道人是否能习惯长时间失掉体重的宇宙飞行。把动物装在人造卫星上作飞行试验，能够进一步研究这个问题。
    文章还谈到了有关宇宙飞行的其它问题。它说，苏联在用火箭进行的试验中已经研究出在宇宙飞行时用电视纪录动物心脏活动和呼吸的方法。动物心脏每收缩一次时，就产生一点电力，这种电力可以用特殊的仪器纪录下来，并且用仪器把信号发回地球。宇宙辐射对动物脑神经中枢也有一定的影响。防止宇宙射线影响的问题是非常复杂的。
    保护动物在火箭上飞行的生命安全的问题不可能在短期内解决。科学家研究携带动物的人造卫星，为实现星际飞行打开了现实的可能性。
