    Regarding the contradiction between the two roads, the ownership of the means of production has been basically resolved in the rural areas of the country. However, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, ideologically, politically, and even in terms of the economic system, will still exist for a considerable period of time. In addition to this basic contradiction of the struggle between the two roads, new contradictions have now emerged in the countryside. This is what Chairman Mao pointed out in his report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," namely, the new contradictions between the state and cooperatives, within cooperatives, and between cooperatives.

    The contradiction between peasants and landlords is a class contradiction, an antagonistic contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. The contradiction between the two roads, in its nature, is the contradiction between socialism and capitalism, which is an antagonistic contradiction. In this struggle of contradictions, apart from the rich peasants who are to be eliminated as a class, the main object of transformation is the 500 million working peasants. Peasants are laborers, not exploiters. Although the upper-middle peasants have spontaneous capitalist ideas, most of them do not have exploitative behavior or only have slight exploitation. Therefore, this contradiction still belongs to the nature of internal contradictions among the people. After the realization of cooperation and the elimination of classes, because landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements still exist, and the struggle between the two roads is not completely over, two types of contradictions will still exist simultaneously in the countryside for a considerable period of time. However, generally speaking, the large number of contradictions existing in the countryside, including the contradictions between the state and cooperatives, are mainly internal contradictions among the people. They are contradictions based on completely consistent fundamental interests, that is, contradictions between temporary and long-term interests, individual and collective interests, partial and overall interests. They are contradictions arising from incomplete consistency in understanding and specific handling of these issues, rather than contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. Therefore, the handling of internal contradictions among the people in rural areas cannot be resolved by using the method of overthrowing the other party, as with landlords, but should be handled according to the principles of strengthening education, promoting democracy, distinguishing right from wrong, and resolving problems. It should be handled in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee, which is "starting from the desire for unity, going through criticism and struggle, and achieving further unity on a new basis." Of course, in some places, when peasants are used by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements to engage in behaviors such as overturning and collapsing cooperatives, attacking cadres, and sabotaging production, thereby producing extremely unfavorable effects on socialism, internal contradictions may be transformed into contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. We must also be vigilant and take necessary measures to deal with this, and not be blindly lenient.

### 关于当前我国农村人民内部矛盾的问题

专栏：报刊论文摘要

    关于当前我国农村人民内部矛盾的问题
    两条道路的矛盾，从生产资料所有制来说在全国农村中已基本上解决了。但从思想上政治上乃至经济制度上来说，社会主义和资本主义这样两条道路的斗争，则仍然相当长期存在着。除了两条道路斗争这个基本矛盾之外，现在农村中又有新的矛盾产生。这就是毛主席在关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题的报告中所指出的，国家与合作社、合作社内部、合作社与合作社之间的新矛盾。
    农民与地主的矛盾，是阶级矛盾，是敌我矛盾。两条道路的矛盾就其性质来说是社会主义与资本主义的矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。在这个矛盾斗争中除富农是要当做阶级被消灭之外，而面对着的主要改造对象，则是五亿劳动农民。农民是劳动者，而不是剥削者，上中农虽然具有自发资本主义思想，但大多数没有剥削行为或者只有轻微的剥削，因此这种矛盾仍然是属于人民内部矛盾的性质。在实现合作化和消灭阶级之后，由于地主富农反革命分子仍然存在，两条道路未完全结束斗争，因此农村中相当长期内仍然同时存在着两类性质的矛盾；但一般说来，农村现存的大量的矛盾，包括国家与合作社之间的矛盾则主要是人民内部的矛盾，是在根本利益完全一致的基础上的矛盾，也就是暂时利益与长远利益、个人利益与集体利益、局部利益与整体利益之间的矛盾，是在认识与具体处理这些问题方法不完全一致所产生的矛盾，而不是敌我矛盾。所以对农村人民内部矛盾的处理，就不能像对待地主一样用打倒对方的办法来解决，而是要按照加强教育，发扬民主，分清是非，解决问题的原则来处理，要依照中央“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评斗争，在新的基础上达到进一步团结”的精神来处理。当然有些地方农民被地富反革命分子利用，进行倒社垮社打干部破坏生产等行为，从而产生对社会主义极端不利的影响的时候，这时内部矛盾也可能转化为敌我矛盾，这也要提高警惕，采取必要的措施来处理，而不能盲目宽大。（摘自1957年“中国青年”第二十一期邓子恢：“论农村人民内部矛盾和正确处理矛盾的方针和办法”）
