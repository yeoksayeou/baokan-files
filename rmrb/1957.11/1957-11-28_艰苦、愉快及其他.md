    Hardship, Joy, and Other Things	Xie Xiaofang
    Some simple-minded people tend to see everything as very easy, as if one could expect a good harvest without hard labor, and wake up to find a communist society already in sight! This is not a joke. Recently, I heard a discussion where a cadre from an organization, after reading the article "After Going to the Countryside" published in the People's Daily on October 21, was very dissatisfied. The article mentioned that some comrades, after going to the countryside to participate in labor, understood the meaning of "Every grain on the plate comes from hard work" and experienced the hardship and joy of labor. He naively questioned: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, do Chinese farmers, who have already embarked on the path of collectivization, still live a life of hard labor? He believed that the author was "distorting the facts," because he himself had participated in labor in the countryside, and his experience was not like that at all; the farmers even sang while working!
    This comrade was not lying; the farmers' mood is indeed joyful when they are working, and they do sing, and the songs they sing are different from those they sang before liberation. Before liberation, they sang: "Autumn arrives, autumn harvest is busy, the rice grains in the field sparkle with gold, although this year's harvest is good, in the end, it all goes into the landlord's granary. Ah! For whom do we toil and for whom do we labor?!" Now they sing: "Sing of the new China, sing of the Communist Party, labor for ourselves, labor for the country, the road of collectivization is truly good, abundance and happiness abound." Therefore, there is no disagreement between us and this comrade about the fact that farmers are in a joyful mood when they work, but is labor itself arduous? The views are very different.
    In this comrade's view, agricultural labor is not arduous, and he even alarmingly said that saying agricultural labor is arduous would affect middle and primary school graduates participating in agricultural production. In his mind, it seems that our Chinese countryside has already reached the realm of communism, everything is mechanized and electrified, and labor is truly extremely easy; just press a switch, and all operations will proceed automatically. However, the reality is not like that after all; after all, China has not yet reached communist society. This comrade has "labored in the countryside"; he would have seen that hoeing the land is done with a hoe, and those who are not used to using it will get blisters on their hands (I wonder if this comrade has had this experience), and plowing the land is done with oxen; there are not so many tractors yet; all other operations are also mostly done with "physical strength." In short, labor requires sweat and is not as easy as talking big. Since the facts are like this, why insist on saying that agricultural labor is not arduous?
    In our view, at present, whether it is agricultural labor or industrial labor, it is all arduous. To make labor non-arduous is our long-term goal, and we must make arduous and long-term efforts. This is already common knowledge, and it seems unnecessary to say more. Perhaps some will ask: "Since this is the case, is there any need to argue about this issue?"
    I think there is a great need for debate. We say that cadres participating in production in the countryside is to train and transform themselves through arduous labor and to do their best to build a new socialist countryside. We do not shy away from the arduousness of labor; precisely because it is arduous, it is a very glorious thing to embark on such an arduous labor post. I think the vast number of cadres and hundreds of thousands of middle and primary school graduates will certainly not be deterred by the word "arduous"; perhaps the mental preparation they have made is even more serious than the reality.
    The comrade above said that agricultural labor is not arduous, which in reality (regardless of whether his subjective wish is so) is to deny and belittle the significance of cadres' labor in the countryside. Since labor is so easy, then what is the special significance of cadres' labor in the countryside? What can they train and transform? Going to the countryside with such an erroneous view, I think, will not lead to any training or transformation, only to hearing a bit of singing, seeing a bit of scenery, and, in more serious cases, shouting: "If I had known it was so arduous, I would not have come down!" Facts prove that there are people who go to the countryside to see the scenery with inexplicable feelings. Recently, I had the opportunity to read several articles written by comrades who went to the countryside, which contained little or no reflection on rural life, and did not talk about their experiences in participating in labor, but instead gave lengthy descriptions of the rural scenery, such as "green hills faintly visible, green waters flowing gently, the sound of insects chirping, the language of birds twittering" and so on. Isn't this phenomenon worthy of our attention?

### 艰苦、愉快及其他

    艰苦、愉快及其他	谢小舫
    有些头脑简单的人，往往把什么事情都看得非常容易，似乎不经过艰苦的劳动，就可以坐望美好的收成，一觉醒来，共产主义社会就已经俨然在目！这不是笑话。最近听到一种议论，一个机关干部在看了10月21日人民日报登的“下乡以后”一文之后，很为不满，因为文中提到有的同志下乡参加劳动以后，才懂得了“谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦”的意义，体会了劳动的艰苦和愉快。他天真地质问道：在中国共产党领导下，已经走向合作化道路的中国农民难道还是过着艰苦的劳动生活吗？他认为作者是在“歪曲事实”，因为他自己就下乡参加过劳动，体会就不是这样，农民在劳动时还唱歌哩！
    这位同志没有说假话，农民在劳动时，心情确实是愉快的，也确实在唱歌，而且唱的歌与解放前唱的不同。他们解放前唱的是：“秋天到，秋收忙，田中稻粒闪金光，虽说今年收成好，到头来却装进了地主的仓。呀！为谁辛苦为谁忙？！”而今唱的是：“歌唱新中国，歌唱共产党，劳动为自己，劳动为国家，合作化道路真正好，丰衣足食喜洋洋”。因此说现在农民在劳动时心情愉快，我们和这位同志之间并没有什么分歧，但是劳动本身是否艰苦呢？看法就大不相同了。
    在这位同志看来，农业劳动是不艰苦的，他并危言耸听地说，如说农业劳动艰苦，会影响中、小学毕业生参加农业生产云云。在他的心目中，似乎我们中国农村已经到了共产主义的境地，一切都机械化、电气化了，劳动真是轻松已极，只要把开关一揿，一切操作都会自动地进行。然而事实毕竟不是如此，毕竟我们中国还没有到共产主义社会。这位同志是“下乡劳动”过的，他会看到：锄地是用锄头，不惯使用的人还会在手上磨起泡（不知这位同志有此经验否），耕地是用牛，还没有那么多的拖拉机；其他一切操作也绝大多数是用“体力”的。总之劳动是要流汗的，并不像说大话那样容易。事实既然是这样，为什么却硬要说农业劳动不艰苦呢？
    在我们看来，在目前，不管农业劳动也好，工业劳动也好，都是艰苦的。要使劳动变成不艰苦，这是我们长远奋斗的目标，还须作艰苦的长期的努力。这已是普通常识，似乎用不着多说。或许有人会问：“既然如此，这个问题还有什么争论的必要呢？”
    我看大有争论的必要。我们说，干部下乡参加生产，是为了通过艰苦的劳动，锻炼和改造自己，并为建设社会主义的新农村尽力。我们并不讳言劳动的艰苦，正因其艰苦，所以走上这样艰苦的劳动岗位，是非常光荣的事情。我想广大的干部和成千上万的中小学毕业生，绝不会被“艰苦”二字所吓退，也许他们所作的思想准备比实际还要严重得多。
    上面那位同志说农业劳动不艰苦，实际上（不管他主观愿望是否如此）是否认和抹煞干部下乡劳动的意义。既然劳动如此轻松，那么干部下乡劳动还有什么特别的意义呢？还能锻炼和改造什么呢？带着这样的错误观点下乡去，我想不会得到什么锻炼和改造，只会听到一点歌声，看到一点风景，严重一点的还会大叫一声：“早知如此艰苦，悔不该下来了”！事实证明，带着莫名其妙的心情下乡看风景的人不是没有。最近有机会读到几篇下乡同志写的文章，其中没有或很少反映农村的生活，也没有谈到自己参加劳动的体会，而是长篇累牍的农村风景的描写，什么“青山隐隐，绿水悠悠，虫声唧唧，鸟语啾啾”之类。这种现象难道不值得我们注意吗？
