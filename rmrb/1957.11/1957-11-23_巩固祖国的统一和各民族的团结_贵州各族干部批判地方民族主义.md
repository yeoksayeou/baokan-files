Consolidate the Unity of the Motherland and the Solidarity of All Nationalities
Guizhou Ethnic Minority Cadres Criticize Local Nationalism

(Our reporter Xiao Ming, Guiyang, November 22nd) At the four-level cadre meeting convened by the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, more than 280 ethnic minority cadres, together with Han cadres, listened to the transmission of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session and studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "Report on the Rectification Movement," unanimously expressing their warm support.

Wang De'an, Governor of the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, said: "Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his report that socialist education should be conducted among ethnic minority cadres and the masses, and appropriate anti-rightist struggles should be carried out, especially focusing on opposing local nationalist ideological tendencies among ethnic minority cadres. I think this instruction is very correct and timely. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party rescued our ethnic minorities from dire straits and continue to lead us in building a happy socialism. This truly represents the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups in our country. Therefore, our Miao people and other ethnic minorities resolutely support the leadership of the Communist Party and steadfastly follow the socialist road. However, in the past two or three years, some ethnic minority cadres in our autonomous prefecture have developed local nationalist tendencies in their thinking. This erroneous ideological tendency exists not only outside the Party but also within the Party, not only in the minds of some general cadres but also in the minds of some cadres in leadership positions. In this rectification movement, we must seriously criticize and struggle against this erroneous ideological tendency. Because it creates division and discord among all ethnic groups, it will inevitably lead to opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party, making socialist construction impossible and causing capitalist restoration. Our ethnic minority cadres, especially Party member cadres, must firmly stand on the proletarian stand and oppose this bourgeois nationalist thought."

Wei Maowen, Governor of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, said that in our autonomous prefecture, local nationalist thought has been gradually rising in the past two years, especially among some intellectuals. They use ethnicization as a pretext to exclude Han cadres. This is essentially opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party and affects the unity of all ethnic groups and the unity of the motherland. It would be very dangerous if this kind of thinking were allowed to develop. We must not only resolutely oppose local nationalist ideological tendencies in this rectification movement, but also conduct education against bourgeois nationalism among our ethnic minority cadres and the masses for a long time to come.

The words of the two autonomous prefecture governors represented the unanimous opinions of the more than 280 ethnic minority cadres present at the meeting. During the week of rectification and study, they focused on examining, analyzing, and criticizing local nationalist ideological tendencies. In the process of criticism, everyone believed that the more serious manifestation was the ideological sentiment of preferring to work independently and being unwilling to cooperate in the relations between various ethnic groups. Some Party member cadres placed ethnic upper-class figures above the Party organization, believing that only ethnic upper-class figures represented the interests of the ethnic group. This extremely erroneous idea was precisely utilized by rightists. In fact, it became an accomplice and echo of the rightists' criminal activities of splitting ethnic unity, undermining the unity of the motherland, and opposing the leadership of the Party and socialist construction. At the meeting, everyone also cited many heartbreaking examples of being utilized by rightists such as Ou Baichuan and Wang Tianxi.

Secondly, the ideological sentiment of excluding Han cadres is more prominent among ethnic cadres from intellectual backgrounds, which is essentially using the pretext of ethnicization to oppose the leadership of the Party and pull the ethnic group backward. This erroneous idea is welcomed by counter-revolutionaries, reactionary landlords and rich peasants among ethnic minorities, and it is precisely what right-wing ambitious people are scheming day and night.

In addition, the meeting also criticized that the existence of local nationalist ideological sentiments among some cadres has affected the emergence of conservative sentiments in some work in some areas. Some cadres still adopt a conservative attitude towards some specific issues when the masses have already become aware, lacking revolutionary spirit, and as a result, they lag behind the masses, support and encourage the development of capitalist ideas, and hinder the economic, cultural, and other aspects of exchanges between all ethnic groups for mutual learning and universal prosperity. This not only affects the unity between various ethnic groups, but also causes internal disputes within the ethnic group.

After a week of examination, analysis, and criticism, the ethnic minority cadres present at the meeting further realized the harm of local nationalist thought. They unanimously stated that it is necessary to resolutely oppose local nationalist thought, which is conducive to the unity of all ethnic groups, to the unity of the motherland, to socialist construction, and to the prosperity and development of ethnic minorities.

    巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结
    贵州各族干部批判地方民族主义
    本报贵阳22日电　记者肖明报道：在中共贵州省委召开的四级干部会议上，二百八十多名少数民族干部，与汉族干部一起听了关于三中全会精神的传达，并学习了邓小平同志作的“关于整风运动的报告”，一致表示热烈拥护。
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州州长王德安说：邓小平同志报告中指出，在少数民族干部和群众中进行社会主义教育，并适当进行反右派斗争，特别是在少数民族干部中应着重反对地方民族主义思想倾向。我认为这个指示很正确，并且很及时。毛主席和共产党把我们少数民族从水深火热中救出来，而且继续领导我们建设幸福的社会主义，这是真正代表了我国各族人民的根本利益。因此，我们苗族人民和其他少数民族，坚决拥护共产党的领导，坚定不移地走社会主义道路。但是，近二、三年来，我们自治州有些少数民族干部思想上滋长了地方民族主义倾向，这种错误思想倾向，不仅在党外有，在党内也有，不仅在部分一般干部思想中存在，在部分身居领导岗位的干部思想中也存在。在这次整风运动中，我们一定要对这种错误思想倾向进行严肃的批判和斗争。因为它在各族人民中制造分裂，制造不和，它必然会导致反对共产党的领导，使社会主义建设无法进行，使资本主义复辟。我们少数民族干部，特别是党员干部，一定要坚定地站在无产阶级立场，反对这种资产阶级民族主义思想。
    黔南布依族苗族自治州州长韦茂文说，在我们自治州里，近两年来地方民族主义思想有逐渐抬头的趋势，特别是一些知识分子。他们借口民族化，排斥汉族干部。这实质上是反对共产党的领导，影响了各民族的团结和祖国的统一。这种思想如让它发展下去，将是十分危险的。我们不仅要在这次整风运动中，坚决反对地方民族主义思想倾向，而且要在今后一个很长时间里，在我们少数民族干部与群众中，进行反对资产阶级民族主义的教育。
    两位自治州州长的话，代表了到会二百八十多名少数民族干部的一致意见。他们在一周的整风学习中，着重对地方民族主义思想倾向进行了检查、分析和批判。在批判过程中，大家认为表现得比较严重的是在各民族的关系上喜好单干、不愿合作的思想情绪。有的党员干部，把民族上层人物置于党组织之上，认为只有民族上层人物才是代表民族利益的。这种极端错误的思想，正好被右派分子所利用。实际上成了右派分子进行分裂民族团结，破坏祖国统一，反对党的领导，反对社会主义建设的罪恶活动的帮手和应声虫。会议上，大家还举出许多被右派分子欧百川、王天锡等利用的令人痛心的事例。
    其次，排斥汉族干部的思想情绪，在部分知识分子出身的民族干部中表现得较为突出，这实质上是借口民族化反对党的领导，把本民族拉向后退。这种错误思想，为少数民族中的反革命分子、反动地主富农所欢喜，也正是右派分子野心家所日夜图谋的。
    另外，会上还批判了由于有些干部存在地方民族主义思想情绪，影响到部分地区的部分工作中产生守旧情绪。有些干部在群众已经有了觉悟的情况下，对一些具体问题仍采取守旧态度，缺乏革命精神，结果落在群众后边，支持和鼓励了资本主义思想的发展，妨碍了各民族为互相学习、为达到普遍繁荣而进行的经济、文化等多方面的交流。这不仅影响了各民族之间的团结，也使得民族内部发生纠纷。
    经过一周的检查、分析和批判，到会的少数民族干部，都进一步认识到地方民族主义思想的危害性。一致表示，必须坚决反掉地方民族主义思想，才有利于各族人民的团结，有利于祖国的统一，有利于社会主义建设，有利于少数民族的繁荣和发展。
