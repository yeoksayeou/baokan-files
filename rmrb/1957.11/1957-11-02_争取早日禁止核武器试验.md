    Strive to Ban Nuclear Weapons Testing at an Early Date
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    Following the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament held in Tokyo this August, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held a mass rally and demonstration on November 1st demanding a ban on nuclear weapons testing, once again demonstrating the Japanese people's indomitable determination to fight for a ban on nuclear weapons. The Chinese people express their heartfelt support and respect for this peace-keeping action of the Japanese people.
    To use atomic energy for peaceful purposes and not for war is the common aspiration of peace-loving people all over the world. Especially in this era of rapid scientific and technological development, with the successful launching of artificial satellites and the opening of the door to spaceflight, the wisdom of mankind used for peaceful purposes will bring unlimited bright prospects for mankind; but if this wisdom is used for the arms race and weapons of murder, it will bring extremely serious consequences. That is why people must safeguard peace and must not allow a devastating war to break out.
    However, the adverse current against peace still exists. The recent talks between Eisenhower and Macmillan in Washington showed that the United States and Britain are still stubbornly rejecting the principle of peaceful coexistence, continuing to advocate the completely bankrupt "policy of strength," trying their best to maintain military blocs, and attempting to strengthen the nuclear arms race. The threat of the United States instigating Turkey to invade Syria has not yet been eliminated. The disarmament discussions in the United Nations have been delayed due to the obstruction of Western countries. These adverse currents cannot but continue to make peace-loving people feel uneasy and worried.
    In this situation, the Japanese people's massive rally demanding a ban on nuclear weapons testing sets an example of positive action for peace-loving people around the world. From the perspective of Japan's domestic political situation, this action of the Japanese people is of particular significance. Although the Japanese government has made some expressions reflecting the people's demands on the issue of banning nuclear weapons under the strong pressure of the people, it has never dared to defy the will of the American aggressors. The Japanese proposal to the United Nations General Assembly on banning atomic and hydrogen bomb tests is a clear example. The Japanese people have repeatedly stated that they firmly demand an unconditional ban on nuclear testing, but the Japanese government's proposal to the United Nations General Assembly entangled the issue of stopping nuclear testing with other disarmament issues, making it difficult to resolve the issue of stopping nuclear testing. This is actually following the attitude of the Western bloc headed by the United States.
    The Japanese people have played a significant role and made outstanding contributions in the struggle against atomic and hydrogen bombs, both in the past and now. The calls for peace issued in the name of the victims of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and the "Lucky Dragon" have far-reaching influence. Recently, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, based on the recommendations of the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, issued a call for a "Two-Week Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons Testing." We fully support this call and will take various actions to demonstrate our desire to stop the nuclear arms race.
    The Chinese people have always been committed to maintaining world peace. We firmly believe that it is absolutely necessary to conclude an international agreement on the prohibition of the manufacture, stockpiling, testing, and use of all weapons of mass destruction. We are willing to join the Japanese people and the people of all countries in the world in carrying out an unswerving struggle to ban nuclear weapons and achieve universal disarmament at an early date, and to strive for lasting world peace.

    争取早日禁止核武器试验
    本报评论员
    继今年8月在东京举行的第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会之后，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会在11月1日又举行了要求禁止核武器试验的群众大会和示威游行，再次显示了日本人民要求禁止核武器的不屈不挠的斗争决心。中国人民对于日本人民的这种维护和平的行动，表示衷心的支持和敬意。
    使原子能用于和平目的而不为战争服务，这是全世界和平人民的一致愿望。特别在科学技术一日千里地向前发展，人造卫星放射成功和打开了宇宙航行大门的时代，人类的智慧用于和平目的，将会给人类带来无限光明的前景；而如果把这种智慧用于军备竞赛和杀人武器，将带来极其严重的后果。这就是为什么人们必须维护和平，决不能容许一场毁灭性的战争打响的原因。
    但是，反对和平的逆流依然存在。不久以前艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦在华盛顿的会谈表明：美国和英国仍然顽固地拒绝和平共处原则，继续鼓吹已经完全破产了的“实力政策”，竭力维持军事集团，并企图加强推行核军备竞赛。美国唆使土耳其侵略叙利亚的威胁尚未消除。联合国的裁军讨论由于西方国家的阻挠迟迟没有进展。这些逆流不能不使爱好和平的人们继续感到不安和忧虑。
    在这种情况下，日本人民举行声势浩大的要求禁止核武器试验的群众集会，为世界爱好和平人民作出了积极行动的榜样。从日本国内政治情况看，日本人民的这一行动尤其具有重大的意义。日本政府在人民的强大压力下，在禁止核武器问题上虽然作过一些反映人民要求的表示，但是它始终不敢违抗美国侵略势力的意志。日本向联合国大会提出的关于禁止试验原子弹和氢弹的提案，就是一个明显的例子。日本人民曾多次表明他们坚决要求无条件地禁止核试验，但是日本政府向联合国大会提出的提案，却把停止核试验问题同其他裁军问题纠缠在一起，使停止核试验的问题难于解决。这实际上是追随以美国为首的西方集团的态度。
    日本人民在反对原子弹氢弹的斗争中，过去和现在都起了很大作用，并作了卓越的贡献。以广岛、长崎和“福龙丸”受难者的名义发出的和平呼声，是有深远影响的。最近世界和平理事会常委会根据第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的建议，又发出了一项关于举行“反对试验核武器双周”的号召。我们完全支持这项号召，并将采取各种行动来表明我们制止核武器竞赛的愿望。
    中国人民一向致力于维护世界和平，我们坚决认为，缔结一个关于禁止制造、贮存、试验和使用一切大规模毁灭性武器的国际协议是完全必要的。我们愿同日本人民、世界各国人民一道，进行坚持不渝的斗争，以争取早日禁止核武器、实现普遍裁军，争取世界的持久和平。
