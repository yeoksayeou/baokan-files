    Flower of Friendship
    Liu Shufang
    Azure ocean!
       Surging ocean!
       Like my heart, restless,
       Like my heart, churning!
       ……
    Who brought this beautiful song from the eastern side of the Adriatic Sea to China? Who makes me think of Yugoslavia whenever I sing this song?
    Friendship, the friendship between the Chinese people and the Yugoslav people!
    Yugoslavia, like us, is a multi-ethnic country. Wherever we went, we saw them enthusiastically working for the construction of a beautiful socialist society. Wherever we went, we heard common praise for our friendship. Her beautiful mountains and majestic cities left a deep impression on us.
    The lyrical and gentle dances, the humorous songs full of life's interest, and the hymns to the unyielding national heroes all tell us that the Yugoslav people are extremely brave, strong, and passionate. They love freedom more than their own lives.
    I often tell my friends about the pleasant experiences of the Chinese Art Troupe in Yugoslavia, in order to let more people share this sincere friendship.
    The Yugoslav Branko Krsmanović Choir and Dance Ensemble, which won gold and silver medals at the 6th World Youth Festival in Moscow, has come to China, has come to Beijing. How happy I am! Friends! I don't have time to tell you more, they have brought new friendship from afar, go and see! Those talented actors will vividly and truthfully tell you everything through song and dance:
    Their rich emotions sing praises of "New Yugoslavia," the resonant and folk-style songs express the people's confidence in socialist construction and today's brilliant achievements.
    They sing with quiet and gentle voices the sailors' longing for their loved ones far from home. It seems to bring us to Dalmatia, along the Adriatic coast...
    In a moment, they sing the intriguing Macedonian humorous songs, which say: "After we got married, we spent all the money, sold everything, and often fought and argued, but this is all love!"
    The most impressive is the "Komiti Dance" of Macedonian exiles defending their national rights. The actors' posture and inner feelings profoundly express the lives of warriors, the struggle against the enemy, from failure to victory, and all kinds of emotions of love for their leader. Although short, it is like an oil painting, unforgettable.
    The brightly colored "Rugovo Shiptar Suite" illustrates the Yugoslav people's love for national traditions and their spirit of bold creation. Based on their recollections, they composed the story of how ancient people won a beautiful woman. Although it is a recollection of the ancients, it adds to its mystery and moving charm.
    The boundless youthful vitality of the "Šopsko Dance" from eastern Serbia, the fiery Gypsy dance in the "Vranje Suite," and the humorous and lively Vlach dance in which Serbians and Vlachs compete with each other powerfully aroused the audience's excitement and praise.
    The most inspiring is the folk music ensemble of six people. With only six instruments, under their skilled technique and passionate command, they presented a picture of the life of the Yugoslav people in a song-like and dance-like manner. People can't help but move with the music.
    What is even more unexpected is that the members of the dance troupe are all students from various universities in Belgrade (some study philosophy, some study art...), but they have rare artistic talents; we can clearly see this from their performances. I wish them success in their performances in our country!

### 友谊之花

    友谊之花
    刘淑芳
    蔚蓝的海洋啊！
       汹涌的海洋啊！
       像我的心一样不平静，
       像我的心一样翻腾！
       ……
    是谁把这优美的歌从亚得里亚海的东面传送到了中国？是谁让我常唱起这首歌想念着南斯拉夫？
    友谊，是中国人民同南斯拉夫人民的友谊！
    南斯拉夫和我们一样，是个多民族的国家，不管我们走到那里都看见他们热情地为美好的社会主义建设在劳动。不管我们走到那里，都能听到对我们友谊的共同赞美。她美丽的山川和雄伟的城市留给了我们极深的印象。
    那抒情的轻歌慢舞、那饱含着生活趣味的诙谐歌调，对不屈不挠的民族英雄的颂歌都告诉了我们，南斯拉夫人民是无比的英勇、强悍、热情。他们酷爱自由，胜过自己的生命。
    我常常要把中国艺术团在南斯拉夫度过的愉快情景向朋友们叙述，为了让更多的人来分享这诚挚的友情。
    曾在莫斯科第六届世界青年联欢节中获得金质、银质奖章的南斯拉夫伯郎柯·克里斯曼诺维奇歌舞团来到了中国，来到了北京，我是多么高兴。朋友啊！我来不及再给你述说，他们从遥远的地方带来了新的友情，去看看吧！那些天才的演员会生动、真实地从歌舞中告诉你一切：
    他们充沛的情感歌颂着“新南斯拉夫”，高吭的、富有民族风格的歌调，表现了人民对社会主义建设的信心和今日的光辉成就。
    他们用安静柔和的声音唱出了远离家乡的水手对爱人的怀念。仿佛把我们也带到了亚得里亚海沿岸的达尔马西亚地方……。
    一会儿，他们又耐人寻味地唱着马其顿诙谐歌曲，歌中这样说：“咱俩结婚以后，花光了所有的钱，卖光了所有的东西，经常打架吵架，然而这都是爱情啦！”
    给人印象最深的是马其顿流放者保卫民族权利斗争的“哥米特舞”，演员们的体态和内心的感情，深刻地表现出勇士的生活，与敌人的斗争，从失败到胜利，以及对领袖爱戴的种种情绪。时间虽短，却像一幅油画，令人难忘。
    色彩鲜明的“鲁戈伏的西普塔尔组舞”，说明了南斯拉夫人民对民族传统的珍爱，和大胆创作的精神。他们根据自己的回想，编作了古代人们如何赢得一个美丽女子的故事。虽然是对古人的回想，却更增加了它神秘动人的地方。
    塞尔维亚东部的“肖普斯科舞”的无限青春活力，“伏兰耶组舞”中的火热的吉普西舞，塞尔维亚和弗拉赫人互相竞赛的诙谐活泼的弗拉赫舞都有力地激起了观众的兴奋和赞扬。
    最振奋人心的要算那六人合奏的民间音乐，仅仅是六件乐器，在他们熟练的技巧和热情的支配下，如歌似舞地展现了南斯拉夫人民生活的画面。人们不禁要随着乐音动起来。
    更使人想不到的是，歌舞团的成员都是来自贝尔格莱德各个大学的学生（有的是学哲学的、有的是学美术的……），但他们却有着难得的艺术才能；我们从他们的演出中就能清楚地看到。祝他们在我国的演出成功！
