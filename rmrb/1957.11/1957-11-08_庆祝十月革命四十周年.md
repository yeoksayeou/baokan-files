    Celebrating the Fortieth Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Dalai Lama
    The fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution is a great festival of world significance. Since the October Revolution, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union have united as one, eliminated the bad capitalist system at home, and not only embarked on the happy road of socialism and communism, but also strengthened the belief of Eastern European and Asian countries that taking the road of the October Socialist Revolution is easy to succeed, and saw this good example. Therefore, they have gradually advanced and now formed a strong peace, democracy and socialist camp with a population of more than one billion. This has not only enabled the world's peace-loving, democratic, and free working people to fearlessly exert great strength, but also provided them with fair assistance and guidance.
  In the forty years since the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, the people of all nationalities, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union, have made achievements in the cause of socialist construction in industry, agriculture, culture, technology, and other aspects that cannot be compared with those of capitalist countries. These situations have been published in detail in the newspapers. In particular, in terms of scientific and technological development, the use of atomic energy in peaceful undertakings, the establishment of nuclear power plants, and the launching of intercontinental missiles have all been creations and inventions that no other country in the world can currently make. This plays a huge role in extinguishing the flames of imperialist aggression and defending world peace. Recently, artificial earth satellites have been successfully manufactured and launched one after another, which has opened a new era in scientific history. The Soviet Union also makes unremitting efforts for the cause of liberation of the working people of the world with the great spirit of proletarian internationalism. The socialist countries are carrying out brotherly assistance to each other, and have been and are providing selfless assistance to the socialist countries for common development. Similarly, the Soviet Union has given great and unspeakable assistance to our country's industrial, agricultural and cultural construction, both in terms of manpower and materials. These are the achievements of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    The unity of the socialist camp countries cannot be destroyed by anyone, and it has become a strong fortress for the working people of the world. Everyone should unite around the Soviet Union and actively strive to defend world peace and win freedom and happiness for the working people. In particular, all nationalities in our country should learn from the advanced achievements and experiences of the Soviet Union in the past forty years, and make great efforts for the successful completion of our country's socialist transformation and construction. This is extremely important.

    庆祝十月革命四十周年
    达赖喇嘛
    十月社会主义革命四十周年是有世界意义的伟大节日。十月革命以来，在苏联共产党的领导下，苏联各族人民团结一致，消灭了国内资本主义坏制度，不仅走上了幸福的社会主义和共产主义道路，并使欧洲东部和亚洲各国增强了走十月社会主义革命道路容易成功的信念，和看到了这个良好的榜样，所以他们逐步前进，现在已经形成了一个拥有十多亿人口力量的和平民主社会主义坚强阵营，这不仅使全世界爱好和平、民主、自由的劳动人民无畏地发挥了巨大力量，并对他们给予公正的援助和指导。
  苏联在十月社会主义革命胜利以来的四十年当中，各族人民在苏联共产党和政府的领导下，进行关于社会主义建设的事业中，在工业、农业、文化、技术等各方面所取得的成绩，都是各资本主义国家所不能比拟的，这些情况已经在报纸上详细的刊登了。特别是在科学技术发展方面，把原子能使用在和平事业上面，建立了原子能发电站，放射出了洲际导弹等，这些都是现在世界上任何其他国家所不能创造发明的，这对扑灭帝国主义侵略火焰和保卫世界和平起着巨大作用。最近又制成了人造地球卫星，经过先后发射成功，这在科学历史上开辟了新纪元。苏联并以伟大无产阶级国际主义精神，为世界劳动人民解放事业作不懈的努力，社会主义阵营的各国互相进行着兄弟般的帮助，并已经和正在为共同发展的各社会主义国家给予无私的援助。同样对我国的工业、农业、文化的建设事业方面无论在人力物力上，苏联都给了很大的难以言喻的帮助，这些都是中苏友好所获得的成就。
    社会主义阵营各国的团结，是任何人都摧毁不了的，他已成为世界劳动人民的坚强堡垒。大家都应该团结在苏联的周围，为保卫世界和平，和争取劳动人民的自由幸福而积极努力。特别是我国各民族，都应该学习苏联四十年来的先进成就和经验，为我国的社会主义改造和建设事业的圆满成功而作巨大努力，这是极重要的事情。
