Opening Waterways, Setting Navigation Marks, Dredging Rivers
    A Great Change in China's Shipping Landscape

    (Our Dispatch) During the First Five-Year Plan period, large-scale development and rectification of coastal and inland river channels were carried out in our country, and the backward state of waterways in old China has been fundamentally changed.

    After the start of the First Five-Year Plan, the relevant departments conducted two general surveys of inland river channels across the country. The surveyed rivers, large and small, totaled 320,000 kilometers in length. Based on the specific conditions of the rivers and channels, large-scale development and rectification work was carried out in various places. It is estimated that by the end of 1957, more than 9,690 kilometers of new waterways will have been opened up across the country, and more than 8,880 kilometers of waterways will have been expanded. The total navigable mileage of inland rivers across the country will reach 104,720 kilometers, an increase of 10.21% compared with 1952; among them, the navigable waterways for ships will reach 39,390 kilometers, an increase of 29.12% compared with 1952. The Lingding Waterway in the Pearl River Estuary, the Lianhua Mountain Waterway, and the Changshan Waterway in Beiyang are all newly opened in recent years. Many waterways that had been blocked for decades have also been opened.

    Most of the original waterways have been dredged and rectified. According to incomplete statistics, in the past five years, 85.44 million cubic meters of mud have been dredged and 2.183 million cubic meters of reefs have been cleared from waterways across the country.

    In recent years, with the help of Soviet experts, navigation departments in various places have widely carried out navigation mark reforms. Up to now, 25,405 kilometers of new chain-type navigation marks have been set up across the country, of which 8,637 kilometers are illuminated. The navigation marks of the Heilongjiang River system have been completely electrified and automated; the Yangtze River and the Pearl River have been partially electrified and automated. The number of navigation marks set up on the Yangtze River has increased by 11.2 times compared with before liberation, and the quality is much better than before liberation. In the past five years, more than 1,000 new and restored navigation marks, radio piles, fog signals, etc. have been built and restored along the coast, more than double the number in the early days of liberation.

    In recent years, 166 sunken ships, totaling 125,638 tons, have also been cleared from coastal ports and inland river channels across the country. The mines laid by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the Yangtze River Estuary waterway before liberation have also been completely cleared.

    After development and rectification, many new features have emerged in waterways across the country. After the rectification of the dangerous shoals of the Yangtze River in the Sichuan River section and the reform of navigation marks, the backward situation of "the dangerous Sichuan River, unable to navigate at night" has been changed. It used to take seven or eight days for a round trip from Yichang to Chongqing, but now it only takes five days. After the initial rectification and installation of navigation marks on the main stream of the Minjiang River, Nanping to Fuzhou can be navigated day and night. In the past, the dangerous shoals and reefs of the Minjiang River were secrets known only to a few people. Now, relying on navigation marks, the old rule of requiring twenty years to train a helmsman has been broken. (Picture attached)

    Since the great Huai River project was carried out seven years ago, it has not only eliminated the flood disasters of the Huai River, but also greatly improved the shipping conditions of the Huai River. There are often a large number of busy transport ships on the Huai River.

    辟航道　设航标　挖河道
    我国航运面貌大改观
    本报讯　第一个五年计划期间，我国沿海和内河航道进行了大规模的开发、整治，旧中国航道的落后状况已经基本改变了。
    第一个五年计划开始以后，有关部门对全国内河航道进行了两次普查。经过普查的大小河流共长三十二万公里。根据河流、航道的具体情况，各地开展了大规模的开发和整治工作。预计到1957年底，全国内河开辟的新航道将有九千六百九十多公里，扩建的航道将有八千八百八十多公里；全国内河通航里程将达十万四千七百二十多公里，比1952年增加10．21％；其中通轮船航道将达三万九千三百九十多公里，比1952年增加29．12％。珠江口伶仃水道、莲花山水道、北洋的长山水道等，都是这几年新开辟的。许多闭塞了几十年的航道也开通了。
    原有航道大部进行了疏浚整治。据不完全统计，五年来全国航道挖泥八千五百四十四万公方，清理礁石二百一十八万三千公方。
    这几年，各地航运部门在苏联专家帮助下，广泛进行了航标改革。到目前为止，全国新设置的锁链式导航标志已经有二万五千四百零五公里，其中发光的有八千六百三十七公里。黑龙江水系的导航标志已经全部电气化、自动化；长江、珠江已经局部电气化、自动化。长江设置的航标比解放前增加了十一点二倍，质量更比解放前优越得多。五年来在沿海新建和恢复的航标、无线电桩、雾信号等，也有一千多座，比解放初期增加一倍以上。
    这几年，全国还清除沿海港口及内河航道中的沉船一百六十六艘，共十二万五千六百三十八吨。解放前夕国民党反动派在长江口航道上布放的水雷，也已经全部清扫干净。
    全国航道经过开发、整治，出现了许多新气象。长江在川江险滩经过整治和进行了航标改革以后，已经改变了“川江天险，不能夜航”的落后面貌。宜昌到重庆原来往返一次需要七、八天，现在只要五天。闽江干流经过初步整治和安设航标以后，南平到福州可以昼夜航行，过去闽江的险滩暗礁是只有少数人掌握的秘密，现在依靠航标导航，打破了过去要二十年培养一个司舵的老规矩。（附图片）
    伟大的治淮工程进行七年来，不仅消灭了淮河的洪水灾害，同时也大大地改善了淮河的航运条件。淮河上经常有大批繁忙运输的船只。
