    A Journey to the Moluccas
    Xie Linfeng
    Not long ago, a group of us journalists boarded the Indonesian Navigation Bureau's ship "Tjarda" from Jakarta, accompanying President Sukarno on a visit to the Moluccas and the capital of West Irian Province.
    The Moluccas comprise nine hundred and ninety-seven islands, large and small, scattered across the Banda Sea and the southwestern end of the Pacific Ocean, with a population of over seven hundred thousand. The Moluccas were once known as the "Spice Islands" for their abundant production of cloves, nutmeg, and other spices. As early as the beginning of the sixteenth century, the Portuguese settled there, followed by the Spanish. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch seized Ambon from the Portuguese and established the first base of the East India Company in Indonesia, initiating a brutal colonial plunder. From then on, Indonesia fell into the tragic fate of colonial rule. The Dutch imposed slave labor in the Moluccas. In order to maintain high prices for spices, they cut down the "surplus" spice trees on the Moluccan islands. They almost exterminated or drove out the fifteen thousand people of Banda Island who bravely opposed them. This bloody rule continued for more than three hundred years.
    After six days at sea, we arrived in Ambon.
    We were greeted by Lieutenant Colonel Peters, commander of the Moluccas and West Irian military district. After the central government imposed martial law, he was effectively the highest authority in the region. He accompanied our group of journalists on a tour of Ambon for a whole day.
    Ambon has a main commercial street. What interests newcomers is that every household hangs beautiful parrots, a specialty of the Moluccas, in front of their doors, and you can hear pleasant chirping everywhere.
    The entire city of Ambon is surrounded by mountains and the sea. We wound our way to Latta on the South Sea coast. This beautiful city has long suffered from colonialist devastation and has experienced countless disasters. The city's architecture is simple and crude. The Dutch colonialists plundered countless riches and left nothing behind. In the last fifteen years, the city has suffered three major destructions: the landings of the Japanese and Allied forces during World War II, and the rebellion of the "Republic of South Moluccas" forces in 1950. The latter rebellion, in particular, directed behind the scenes by colonialists, burned the main street to the ground, leaving only a mosque. Today, there is not even a wooden bench for tourists to rest on, let alone a hotel, by the sea. Lieutenant Colonel Peters told us that the central and local governments are planning to build this city into a tourist attraction within five years.
    However, things are not entirely peaceful in the beautiful Moluccas at present. It is said that several hundred soldiers of the "Republic of South Moluccas" army are still active in the mountains of Seram Island. Spying from other sources has not been relaxed either. Not long ago, American espionage activities were discovered in Ternate, the second major city of the archipelago, which is a clear example. Many Americans go there under various pretexts to conduct "research," while British and American news agencies are constantly creating news that "the Moluccas may secede from the central government."
    Currently, spice production in the Moluccas has been greatly reduced due to the long-term oppression and devastation by Dutch colonialists. The islands only export copra, spices, and some marine products such as pearls and shells. Copra production is 7,500 tons per month. As for fish production, although the quantity is large, it cannot be pickled due to lack of salt and refrigeration equipment, so very little is exported.
    The people of the Moluccas are heroic, and they have engaged in a long struggle with foreign rulers. Pati Mura, the anti-Dutch national hero of the nineteenth century, is still the most respected by the people. Everywhere we went, we heard legends about him and saw dances about his heroic deeds. Pati Mura's name has become a force to inspire people to fight against colonialism.
    The beach near the "Inspiration Garden" in Ambon is Pati Mura's burial place. After the Dutch hanged the hero, put him in an iron barrel, and threw him into the sea, they were still afraid of his influence, so they barbarously stipulated that people were not allowed to go there to pay tribute, and even people passing by were not allowed to look back at the sea. But the spark of resistance was deeply buried in the hearts of the people. After Pati Mura, countless Pati Muras stood up. People continued to fight against the Dutch with sharp bamboo spears and swords. To this day, we can still see bamboo spear teams composed of young people on the islands. Of course, they are now used to protect the independence and integrity of the motherland. Now, we can also see the torches burning in the hearts of the people to recover West Irian.
    In Ternate, a group of us journalists boarded the flagship "Kadahmadja" with President Sukarno to visit Soasiu, the capital of West Irian Province.
    Soasiu has a population of only three thousand people and is a city built on a hillside. The mountains are not very high, and the hills and slopes are full of coconut groves. After arriving in Soasiu, we laboriously climbed up the steps. On both sides of the stone steps, people were packed tightly. Representatives of the West Irianese people, wearing West Irianese national costumes, led the welcome for President Sukarno.
    This enthusiastic welcome was the same everywhere. Wherever President Sukarno went, the people held mass rallies, shouting slogans, and holding banners, demanding the recovery of West Irian and the expulsion of the imperialists. They happily answered President Sukarno's questions by saying that they only had one central government in Jakarta. They were against separatist activities. They knew that the integrity of the motherland was the guarantee of independence, and the unity of the nation was the strength to recover West Irian.
    After participating in the mass rally in Soasiu, we rested briefly in the governor's office, and the governor discussed with the journalists some information about West Irian.
    Governor Suwages, who was the Sultan of Tidore in the past, told us that the capital of West Irian was located here because his ancestors were the first to discover this place, and it had long been part of the Sultanate of Tidore's jurisdiction. West Irian was known as Papua earlier. The word Papua is a Tidore vernacular, meaning "distant place." The governor said that history can prove that West Irian was long a part of Indonesian territory.
    The governor also spoke about the patriotic people of West Irian being tortured and killed by the Dutch occupation army and the suffering of the people there. He said that people often run out of there and secretly bring out letters from there, accusing the atrocities of the Dutch occupation army. These letters will be submitted to the United Nations as evidence.
    That evening, we also saw the real West Irian dance performed by the West Irianese people. The dancers were half-naked, wearing "bird of paradise" headdresses, and the men were holding bows and arrows. Although the dance steps were simple, they were rapid and powerful. Coupled with the deep drumbeats and loud singing, it made people feel that this was the cry of resistance from an oppressed nation.
    When we left the Moluccas and returned to Jakarta, looking down at these picturesque and rich islands from the plane, I silently blessed the people there, believing that they would eventually build a truly happy life on these beautiful islands. (Attached picture)

    摩鹿加群岛纪行
    谢林风
    不久以前，我们一批记者从雅加达登上印度尼西亚航海局的轮船“查达耶”号，随苏加诺总统访问了摩鹿加群岛和西伊里安省的首府。
    摩鹿加群岛包括九百九十七个大小岛屿，散布在班达海和太平洋的西南端，人口约七十多万。摩鹿加过去盛产丁香、豆蔻等香料，有“香料群岛”之称。远在十六世纪初，葡萄牙人就在那里落脚，接着是西班牙人。到十七世纪初，荷兰人又从葡萄牙人手中夺取了安汶，建立了东印度公司在印度尼西亚的第一个根据地，开始了残酷的殖民掠夺。从此以后，印度尼西亚就落入殖民主义统治的悲惨命运中。荷兰人在摩鹿加实施了奴隶劳动。他们为了维持香料的高价，砍伐了摩鹿加各岛的“多余”的香料树。他们几乎杀绝和赶光了英勇反对他们的一万五千个班达岛的人民。这种血腥统治继续了三百多年之久。
    经过六天的海上生活，我们抵达了安汶。
    迎接我们的是摩鹿加和西伊里安军分区司令彼得斯中校。中央政府颁布军事戒严之后，他实际上是这个地区的最高负责人。他陪着我们这一群记者在安汶游览了一整天。
    安汶有一条主要的商业街。使新来的客人感到兴趣的是家家户户门前挂着摩鹿加盛产的美丽的鹦鹉，到处听得到悦耳的鸣声。
    安汶整个城市被群山环抱着，被大海围绕着。我们转转弯弯又来到了南海边的拉都。这个秀丽的城，长期遭受殖民主义的蹂躏，经历过无数次的灾难。城市的建筑是简陋的。荷兰殖民者掠夺去了无数财富，什么都没有给留下来。近十五年，城市又遭受过三次大破坏，那就是二次大战时，日军、盟军的登陆，和1950年“南摩鹿加共和国”军的叛乱活动。特别是后一次由殖民主义者在幕后指挥的叛乱，把主要街道烧了个精光，只剩下一所回教堂。现在的海边，不要说旅馆，就是一条供游人休息的木凳都没有。彼得斯中校告诉我们说，中央和地方政府正计划在五年内把这个城市建筑成供人游览的胜地。
    但是，目前在美丽的摩鹿加并不是太平无事的，据说“南摩鹿加共和国”军队还剩下几百人在西兰一岛的山中活动。来自其他方面的窥伺也没有放松。不久前，在群岛的第二个主要城市干那底发现的美国间谍活动便是一个明证。不少美国人以各种名义到那里去进行“研究”，而英美通讯社又不断制造“摩鹿加可能脱离中央”的消息。
    目前摩鹿加群岛的香料生产，由于荷兰殖民主义者长期的压榨和摧残，早已大大减产。各岛只输出椰干、香料和珍珠、贝壳等一些海产品。椰干的产量每月有七千五百吨。至于鱼产，数量虽然很多，但由于缺少盐和没有冷藏设备，不能腌制，也就很少出口。
    摩鹿加人民是英勇的，他们和外国统治者进行过长期的斗争。十九世纪的反荷民族英雄巴蒂慕拉至今仍是人民最崇敬的人。我们经过的地方都听到关于他的传说，看到关于他的英雄事迹的舞蹈，巴蒂慕拉的名字也成了鼓舞人民进行反对殖民主义斗争的力量。
    安汶“灵感花园”附近的海滨就是巴蒂慕拉的葬身之处。荷兰人把英雄绞死、装入铁桶、抛入海里后，还害怕他的影响，因此竟野蛮地规定，不准人民到那里去凭吊，连路过那里的人回头向海望一下都不行。但反抗的火种却深埋在人民的心中，在巴蒂慕拉之后，有无数的巴蒂慕拉站起来，人们以尖利的竹枪、刀剑为武器，继续不断地进行了反荷斗争。至今，我们还可以在各岛看到年青人组成的竹枪队。当然，他们现在是用来保护祖国的独立和完整了。现在，我们也可以看到燃烧在人们心头的收复西伊里安的火把。
    在干那底我们一群记者登上“卡渣马达”号旗舰，同苏加诺总统一起去访问西伊里安省的省府韶修。
    韶修的人口只有三千人，是一个筑在山坡上的城市，山不太高，满山满坡是椰子林。到韶修后，我们艰难地拾级而上，石级的两旁，人们挤得水泄不通，穿戴着西伊里安民族服装的西伊里安人民的代表带头迎接苏加诺总统。
    这种热烈的欢迎，在各处都一样。苏加诺总统所到之处，人民都举行了群众大会，人们喊着口号、打着标语，要求收复西伊里安，要求赶走帝国主义者。他们高兴答复苏加诺总统的问题说，他们只有一个在雅加达的中央政府。他们是反对分裂活动的，他们知道祖国的完整是独立的保证，民族的团结是收复西伊里安的力量。
    参加韶修的群众大会后，在省长公署稍事休息，省长就和记者们座谈有关西伊里安的一些情况。
    省长苏瓦格斯，也就是过去的帝多列的苏丹，他告诉我们说，把西伊里安首府设在这儿是因为西伊里安这块地方就是他的祖先首先发现的，很久以前就是帝多列苏丹的辖地的一部分。西伊里安较早就被称为巴布亚。巴布亚这个词是帝多列的土语，意思是“遥远的地方”。省长说，历史可以证明西伊里安老早就是印度尼西亚领土的一个部分。
    省长也谈起了西伊里安的爱国志士被荷兰占领军虐杀和那里人民生活困苦的情况。他说，经常有人从那儿跑出来和从那里偷偷带出信来，控诉荷兰占领军的暴行。这些信件将提交联合国作为证件。
    那天傍晚，我们也看到了西伊里安人民跳的真正的西伊里安舞，舞者半裸着身体，以“天堂鸟”为头饰，男的拿着弓箭，舞步虽然简单，但急促有力，加上沉浊的鼓声，高昂的歌声，使人感受到这是被压迫的民族反抗的呼号。
    我们离开了摩鹿加回雅加达的时候，从飞机上俯瞰这些景色如画而又富饶的岛屿，我默默祝福那里的人民，深信他们终究会在这些美丽的岛屿上面建设起真正幸福的生活。（附图片）
