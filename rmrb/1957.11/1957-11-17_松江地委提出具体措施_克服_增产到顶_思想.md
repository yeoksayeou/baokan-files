Songjiang Prefectural Committee Proposes Concrete Measures
To Overcome the "Production Has Reached Its Peak" Mentality

    (Our dispatch) The CCP Songjiang Prefectural Committee of Jiangsu Province, in mid- to late-October, successively convened a meeting of the Prefectural Committee and a meeting of County Party Secretaries. In accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, it overcame conservative thinking regarding the development of agricultural production. It conducted a preliminary plan for agricultural production in the Songjiang area, deciding to achieve the target of 800 jin of grain per mu as proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule during the Second Five-Year Plan.
    Since liberation, grain production in the Songjiang area has increased year after year, and the idea that "production has reached its peak" has spread again in many places. The CCP Songjiang Prefectural Committee, through presenting facts and calculating overall accounts at several meetings, first overcame the conservative thinking of the responsible cadres of the prefectural and county committees. This area has always been a high-yield grain area. Many high-yield banners of 800 jin per mu have appeared throughout the area. Some counties have doubled their grain production compared to the past, but some counties have only increased by 10%. This shows that there is great potential for increased production. As long as we strengthen our subjective efforts, the target of 800 jin per mu in the entire area can be fully achieved by 1962. The CCP Songjiang Prefectural Committee called on all cadres to put forth their greatest efforts to implement several concrete measures to ensure increased grain production: first, increase the multiple cropping index; second, increase fertilizer accumulation, the main methods being to develop pig raising and increase the unit area yield of green manure; in terms of building small-scale farmland water conservancy, it is required that drought and flood disasters be basically eliminated by 1962. The Songjiang Prefectural Committee also plans to gradually improve the 800,000 mu of low-yield fields in the entire area into high-quality fields by 1962. (Fan Wanjun)

    松江地委提出具体措施
    克服“增产到顶”思想
    本报讯  中共江苏省松江地委在10月中、下旬先后召开地委会和县委书记会议，根据三中全会精神，克服在发展农业生产上的保守思想，对松江地区农业生产进行初步规划，决定在第二个五年计划期间，提前达到全国农业发展纲要提出的亩产粮食八百斤的指标。
    松江地区自解放以后，粮食年年增产，现在“增产到顶”的思想，在不少地方又流传开来。中共松江地委在几次会议上经过摆事实、算大账，首先克服了地、县委负责干部的保守思想。这个地区历来就是粮食丰产区，全区出现了很多亩产八百斤的丰产旗帜，有的县粮食比过去增产一倍，但有的县只增产10％。这说明增产潜力很大，只要加强主观努力，到1962年，全区亩产八百斤的指标，是完全可以达到的。中共松江地委号召全体干部，拿出最大的劲头，来贯彻几项保证粮食增产的具体措施：首先是增加复种指数，其次是增积肥料，主要办法是发展养猪和提高绿肥单位面积产量；在兴修小型农田水利方面，要求到1962年基本上消除旱涝灾害。松江地委还计划到1962年将全区的八十万亩低产田逐步改良为上等田。  （范万钧）
