     Ode to Moscow
     Wen Jie
     Dedication
     I have never been to Moscow
     Never walked down Gorky Street
     Never climbed Lenin Hills
     To gaze at the Moscow River from there
     I am as familiar with you as I am with our Beijing
     Familiar with the fluttering flags on Red Square
     Familiar with the chimes of the Kremlin
     The red star atop the Spasskaya Tower
     I cherish you as I cherish our family
     Cherish the streetlights on every one of your streets
     Cherish the fountains in every one of your gardens
     Every hardworking Soviet person
     I yearn for Moscow so much
     Because your sound waves reach me through the radio
     Because you flash across the silver screen
     And I have a song of praise in my heart

     Red Square
     The flags of Red Square
     Billow in the westerly wind
     Fluttering in the azure sky of October
     Close to the Kremlin's red walls
     There stand the stars of the Soviets
     There stand the stars of the Soviets
     Waving their hats in salute to the mighty procession
     Reviewing the strength that defends world peace
     The Soviet people will forever advance victoriously
     The Soviet people will forever advance victoriously
     Majestic eagles fly across the sky
     Katyusha rockets spread out in a long formation on the ground
     Red Square is filled with strength and confidence
     Red Square is filled with strength and confidence
     Joyful fireworks spray out a sky full of stars
     And in that sky that mankind has not yet reached
     An artificial satellite is flying
     An artificial satellite is flying
     Bringing new glory to the Soviet people
     All of humanity congratulates you on your fortieth birthday
     Red Square attracts hundreds of millions of eyes
     Red Square attracts hundreds of millions of eyes
     All of humanity cheers the Soviets for ensuring peace
     Close to the Kremlin's red walls
     The Soviet stars chat and laugh

    Chimes
    The chimes of the Kremlin
    Excite the hearts of the Soviet people
    Like a rushing waterfall
    Arousing the echoes of the mountains
    Your voice is so loud and clear
    Summoning every beautiful dawn
    People thank you for your passionate call
    Responding to you with fiery passion
    From the Urals to the Don Steppe
    From Tashkent to Minsk
    People dedicate selfless labor
    And exuberant youth
    The magnificent building of socialism
    Rises layer upon layer on your land
    Like the rising red sun
    Radiating boundless light to the world
    You also raised your arms and shouted
    Heavily striking the hearts of the Red Army soldiers
    People, encouraged by you
    Set out on the journey the next day
    People shouted your name
    One footprint covering another
    From the Volga to the Elbe
    From Stalingrad to Berlin
    When people return victoriously
    Your voice is smooth and joyful
    As if singing a song of triumph
    Welcoming and cleansing the heroes
    The chimes of the Kremlin will forever inspire the Soviet people
    Because you are the spokesperson of truth
    Spreading the voice of the Party Central Committee

    Red Star
    The Spasskaya Red Star
    Is as red as May's pomegranate flower
    Is as red as May's pomegranate flower
    Blooming in the Moscow sky
    The Spasskaya Red Star
    Is brighter than the morning star at dawn
    Is brighter than the morning star at dawn
    Shining far beyond the long border
    The Spasskaya Red Star
    Has not blinked for forty years
    Has not blinked for forty years
    Watching over the suffering brothers
    The Spasskaya Red Star
    You are a loyal heart of the Soviet people
    You are a loyal heart of the Soviet people
    Hundreds of millions of people are in harmony with you
    The Spasskaya Red Star
    Shines on the working people of the whole world
    Shines on the working people of the whole world
    Towards a peaceful and happy future
    The Spasskaya Red Star
    Around you twelve new stars shine
    Around you twelve new stars shine
    Circling you, the core of the universe

    Mausoleum
    Red Square has wide roads
    Red Square has verdant fir trees
    The great teacher rests here
    Here is a granite mausoleum
    People, although coming from all over the world
    Form a long line here
    Facing the creator of the Soviet motherland
    Pouring out their joy and sorrow
    Envoys from people's democratic countries
    Take back sincere blessings from here
    Returning to build a paradise on earth
    High mountains and long rivers, with red flowers and green willows
    Representatives of colonial countries
    Take back fiery encouragement from here
    Returning to sever the chains of slavery
    Awakening their sleeping nations
    People from capitalist countries
    Take back blueprints for struggle from here
    Returning to save themselves
    Overthrowing the old system of cannibalism
    Red Square has wide roads
    Red Square has verdant fir trees
    The great teacher rests here
    Here is a granite mausoleum
    People admire the great teacher
    Gently stepping in unison
    The great heart forever beats
    Indicating the way forward for mankind

     Anthem
     Although I have never been to Moscow
     I also offer the anthem in my heart
     On the eve of your fortieth anniversary
     In your glorious October
     I will forever sing of Moscow
     Sing of your worker's class homeland
     Sing of you raising the red flag forty years ago
     The first to break the shackles of mankind
     I praise Moscow a hundredfold
     Praising your forty years of great construction
     Praising you, the pioneer of human society
     Leaping towards communism
     I feel the greatest happiness today
     For singing the first anthem to you
     For sharing the joy of your glorious festival
     My heart flies to Moscow

              1957、10、31、Beijing
