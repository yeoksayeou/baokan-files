National Football League Continues
First Machine Team and Beijing Team Draw, "August 1st" Team Defeats Shenyang Military Region Team

(Our Newspaper's News) Two matches in the National Football League were held in Beijing on the 10th. The First Machine Sports Association Team drew with the Beijing Team with a score of 0-0; the "August 1st" Team defeated the Shenyang Military Region Team with a score of 2-1.

In the match between the First Machine Team and the Beijing Team, both teams adopted a four-forward, three-defender formation. The First Machine Team knew that Beijing Team's forwards Fang Renqiu and Zhang Honggen were skilled shooters, so they arranged the two fastest players in the midfield positions to closely mark Fang Renqiu and Zhang Honggen as soon as they entered the midfield. With their shooters unable to get a clear shot, the Beijing Team lost its offensive power. Although the First Machine Team blocked the Beijing Team's attack, they did not dare to advance lightly. They only dared to make long drives under the pressure of their defenders, but they could not break through the "impenetrable wall" in front of the Beijing Team's goal. Thus, the two sides fought fiercely back and forth on the field until the ninety minutes were up, and the score on the field was still 0-0.

When the "August 1st" Team played against the Shenyang Military Region Team, Cui Hengxie on the left wing scored a goal in the first half, taking a temporary lead. In the second half, Xian Dixiong on the left wing of the "August 1st" Team and Cui Peiji on the left wing of the Shenyang Military Region Team each scored a goal. The match ended with a score of 2-1, with the "August 1st" Team winning.

    甲级足球队联赛继续举行
    一机、北京队战和，“八一”队胜沈阳部队队
    本报讯　全国甲级足球队联赛，10日在北京举行了两场比赛。第一机械体协队以○比○战和北京队；“八一”队以二比一胜沈阳部队队。
    一机队和北京队在比赛中，全都采用了四前锋三后卫制。一机队早就知道北京队的前锋方纫秋、张宏根射门脚头厉害，因此他们在前卫的位置上安排了两个跑得最快的队员。方纫秋和张宏根一进入中场，就被他们紧紧地看住了。北京队在射手不能开弓的情况底下，失去了进攻的威力。一机队虽然挡住了北京队的进攻，但也未敢轻进，他们只有在后卫的压阵底下，才敢长驱直入，可是他们攻不破北京队门前布下的“铜墙铁壁”。就这样，双方在场上，你来我往酣战不休，直至九十分钟完了，场上的比分仍是○比○。
    “八一”队在战沈阳部队队时，上半场左翼崔亨燮踢进一球暂告领先。下半场“八一”队左锋冼迪雄，沈阳部队队左锋崔培吉各射入一球。全场以二比一告终，“八一”队胜。
