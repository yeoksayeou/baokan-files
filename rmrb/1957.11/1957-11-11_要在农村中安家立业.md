This year, approximately three million urban and rural primary and secondary school graduates have participated in agricultural production nationwide. Most of these students have performed well in the short few months of production labor. They are actively working, able to endure hardship, abide by labor discipline, diligently learn agricultural production techniques, and have a harmonious relationship with local farmers, thus receiving praise from agricultural cooperative cadres and members. This is the main aspect. However, according to reports from various regions, some students are still ideologically restless. Therefore, how to strengthen the ideological and political education of the students participating in production this year, how to consolidate their confidence in participating in production, and how to bring their role into play in production are issues that deserve attention from various regions.

Among the primary and secondary school graduates participating in agricultural production, some do not plan to "settle down" in the countryside, but rather hold a "temporary stopover" attitude, with some even calling themselves "temporary brand new-style farmers." We have stated more than once that the task of our country's general education is primarily to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, and secondarily to lay the foundation for cultivating specialized talents. Only a small portion of primary and secondary school graduates can advance to higher education, and the rest should participate in production labor. This is a fundamental policy of the state for students who cannot advance to higher education, and it is also necessary for building a socialist countryside. The state not only mobilized a large number of primary and secondary school graduates to participate in agricultural production this year, but will continue to mobilize them to participate in agricultural production in the future. Article 38 of the "Revised Draft of the National Agricultural Development Program" states: "Urban primary and secondary school graduates, in addition to those who can advance to higher education or find employment in cities, should actively respond to the call of the state, go to the countryside and mountains to participate in agricultural production and the great cause of socialist agricultural construction. Eighty-five percent of our country's population is in the countryside. If agriculture does not develop, industry cannot develop alone. Going to the countryside to work is very necessary and extremely glorious." This is a great call to urban and rural educated youth. Educated youth who have already participated in agricultural production should fully recognize that the position of agriculture in our country's socialist construction is extremely important. Agriculture provides industry with the grain and raw materials it needs, and also provides industry with the largest domestic market. The development of agriculture has a direct impact on the lives of the majority of people, on the worker-peasant alliance and people's unity, and on the speed of our country's industrialization. In this light, the participation of educated youth in agricultural production is not only a support for agriculture, but also greatly benefits the development of industry. Educated youth engaged in agricultural production are as important, as glorious, and have as bright a future as those in industrial production and other jobs. The idea of ​​holding a temporary view of engaging in agricultural production is wrong. Educated youth who have already entered production but whose minds are still unstable should understand this principle and settle down. Some who are blindly rushing around should stop and quickly devote themselves to production. Those who have not yet participated in production should enthusiastically respond to the call of the state and go to the countryside and mountains!

Some students were very enthusiastic about labor when they first went to the countryside, but after a period of time, they could not bear the hardship and fatigue, and their enthusiasm for labor gradually decreased. It should be pointed out that because our country's industry and science and technology are relatively backward, it is impossible to supply agriculture with a large amount of modernized machinery and equipment in the short term. Therefore, agricultural production in our country mainly relies on relatively simple production tools and heavy manual labor for a certain period of time. This is a historical phenomenon in our country's transition to a socialist society. Our task is to change this situation and turn our country into a great modernized industrial country and a modernized agricultural country, that is to say, in the future we will replace the current relatively heavy simple labor with large-scale mechanized labor. To achieve such a goal, we need the hard work of the people of the whole country, we need everyone to endure hardship and be hardworking, and we need everyone to consciously engage in the current agricultural manual labor, improve labor productivity, and increase agricultural output. Therefore, educated youth should not waver in the face of hardship and difficulties, but should inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle of our people, work tirelessly, and bravely overcome difficulties. There is an old Chinese saying: "No steel can be made without tempering." Promising educated youth should be able to withstand wind and sun, stand the test, and temper themselves into strong laborers in the great furnace of production labor.

Some junior and senior high school graduates who go to the countryside have a sense of "superiority." They believe that they have a certain cultural and scientific foundation of knowledge, and that their arrival in the countryside is to "transform" or "innovate" the countryside. Therefore, some do not obey the assignments, are picky about their work, and some do not get along with farmers, cannot talk to them, and even look down on farmers. Some areas report that primary school graduates who go to the countryside to participate in production are better than junior high school graduates, junior high school students are better than senior high school students, and senior high school graduates are difficult to deal with. In Xingyang County, Henan Province, a senior high school graduate was asked by the township to serve as the deputy director of an agricultural cooperative, but he shook his head and refused; when he was asked to be an accountant, he left without even shaking his head. This kind of behavior of considering oneself a "transformer" or "innovator," being conceited, looking down on farmers, and disobeying leadership is a manifestation of arrogance and ignorance. It should be understood that the older generation of farmers may lack cultural and scientific knowledge, but they have rich production experience. The reason why they lack scientific knowledge is because they were oppressed and exploited in the past, which was left over from the old society. The reason why young students now have the opportunity to study and learn some knowledge is precisely because the older generation of workers and peasants carried out arduous revolutionary struggles under the leadership of the Party and won the victory of the revolution. The purpose of young people learning basic cultural and scientific knowledge is to serve the development of production, and they must never become arrogant because of this, thinking that they are great. Comrade Mao Zedong said long ago: "Since the existence of class society, there are only two kinds of knowledge in the world, one is called the knowledge of the struggle for production, and the other is called the knowledge of class struggle." Middle school students who have just participated in production, even if they have learned some basic cultural and scientific knowledge in school, are only book knowledge. When it comes to farming, they are completely ignorant and far behind the farmers, which is not worth being proud of. For educated youth, participating in agricultural production is production labor, but also a kind of learning, and the most vivid lesson in socialist labor education. If they want to "transform" and "innovate" the countryside, they should first transform themselves and learn from the farmers respectfully. Learn from the farmers' production experience, learn from the farmers' fine qualities of enduring hardship, being hardworking and thrifty, cultivate a socialist labor perspective, and transform their thoughts and feelings in the process of living and working together with the farmers, get rid of the bad habits of intellectuals, and gradually become a veritable new-style farmer with culture, consciousness, and production skills.

The Party and the Communist Youth League organizations, especially the grassroots organizations of townships and cooperatives, should regularly conduct socialist ideological education for these graduates participating in production. Currently, there is a tendency in some places to pay more attention to arranging jobs for students who go to the countryside and provide more care for their lives, but to neglect the ideological and political education of students who go to the countryside. It is necessary and appropriate to properly arrange and care for their lives, but ideological work should not be neglected, because ideological work is the soul of all work. The specific content of ideological and political education for graduates should be carried out around the center of "loving the motherland, loving the countryside, loving labor, and loving the cooperative as home." They should be organized to participate in the current socialist great debate in the countryside, and through debate, clarify the muddled ideas that these students have on many issues such as agricultural cooperation, the future of the countryside, the policy of unified purchase and sale, and the differences in the lives of workers and peasants, improve their socialist consciousness and enthusiasm for engaging in socialist construction in the countryside, and enhance their sense of career for engaging in agricultural production for a long time. At the same time, they should also be organized to conduct debates according to the characteristics and ideological problems of the students. The Communist Youth League organization in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, once organized more than 130 educated youths in Fujumiao Township to debate the following questions: Is participating in agricultural production a "waste of talent"? Can one learn and progress by doing farm work? The effect of the debate was very good. After the debate, a senior primary school graduate said: "In the past, I was blinded by the devil, and I always thought that doing farm work was unpromising. Now I see the happy prospects of the countryside. In the future, I will definitely settle down and build a beautiful hometown with my own hands."

Helping educated youth learn to master agricultural production skills and promptly solving problems in their lives are also important measures to make them feel at ease in agricultural production. The students who went to the countryside this year have just started production, and they generally lack physical exercise and production skills. Therefore, in addition to rationally organizing and arranging their production, they should be actively helped and encouraged to learn from the farmers' production experience and agricultural science and technology, and learn agricultural production skills as soon as possible. Only in this way can they become interested in agriculture, can they play a role in production, and can they maintain their lives and even support their families with their own labor income. In this way, they have a material basis for living in the countryside, and it is possible for them to settle down in the countryside for a long time and build a career. Now, some areas pay more attention to this issue. For example, some cooperatives appoint experienced old farmers to teach them production experience, and some areas invite agricultural technology promotion stations, science popularization associations, etc. to explain scientific production technology to them. These should be promoted.

At present, students who go to the countryside in some places still have more or less problems in terms of food, accommodation, work point standards, cooperative shares, and relations with cadres and residents. Various places should try to solve them. For the cooperative shares of graduates, they should generally be allowed to pay in installments, and the work point standards should be fair and reasonable, and students who have just participated in production should not be discriminated against. In addition to conducting in-depth ideological education for students, necessary ideological work should also be carried out for township and cooperative cadres and farmers in terms of the relationship between students and cadres and farmers. They should adopt a sincere and welcoming attitude towards the students who go to the countryside, care for them like they care for their own children or younger siblings, patiently give them help, and take the initiative to promote unity.

This year, a large number of primary and secondary school graduates have gone to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, which is a great victory for socialist ideological education. However, mobilizing them to go to the countryside is only the first step in the work. What is more important is to make them take root, blossom, and bear fruit in the countryside. Therefore, various places must not relax any ideological education for students who go to the countryside. It should be known that doing this work well is of great significance for developing agricultural production and changing social customs. In the future, we must not only continue to mobilize more primary and secondary school graduates to go to the countryside and mountains, but also consolidate the labor enthusiasm of those who have already gone to the countryside, so that they can take root and become an active force in rural production and construction and scientific and cultural undertakings. Everyone should work hard to achieve this goal.

### 要在农村中安家立业

    要在农村中安家立业
    今年全国有三百万左右城乡中小学毕业生参加了农业生产。这些学生下乡以后，在短短几个月的生产劳动当中，大多数表现很好。他们积极劳动，能够吃苦耐劳，遵守劳动纪律，认真学习农业生产技术，同当地农民关系融洽，因而受到农业合作社干部和社员的好评。这是主要的方面。但是，据各地反映，也有一部分学生至今思想上动荡不安。因此，如何加强对今年参加生产的学生的思想政治教育，如何巩固他们参加生产的信心，并且在生产中发挥他们的作用，是值得各地注意的事情。
    在参加农业生产的中小学毕业生中，有些人不打算在农村“安家落户”，而是抱着在农村“临时站站脚”的态度，有的甚至自称是“暂时牌的新式农民”。我们不止一次地讲过，我国普通教育的任务主要是培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，其次才是为培养专门人才打基础。中小学毕业生能升学的只是一小部分人，其余的应当参加生产劳动。这是国家对于不能升学的学生的一条根本方针，也是建设社会主义的农村所必需的。国家不仅在今年动员大量中小学毕业生参加农业生产，而且在今后将继续动员他们去参加农业生产。“全国农业发展纲要修正草案”第三十八条中写道：“城市的中、小学毕业的青年，除了能够在城市升学、就业的以外，应当积极响应国家的号召，下乡上山去参加农业生产，参加社会主义农业建设的伟大事业。我国人口百分之八十五在农村，农业如果不发展，工业不可能单独发展。到农村去工作是非常必要的和极其光荣的。”这是对于城乡知识青年的一个伟大号召。已经参加农业生产的知识青年，应当充分地认识到农业在我国社会主义建设中的地位是十分重要的，农业给工业提供了所需要的粮食和原料，也给工业提供了最大的国内市场。农业的发展，对于大多数人的生活，对于工农联盟和人民团结以及我国工业化的发展速度，都发生直接的影响。这样看来，知识青年参加农业生产不仅是对农业的一种支援，而且对工业的发展也有极大好处。知识青年从事农业生产如同在工业生产及其他工作岗位上一样重要，一样光荣，一样有光明的前途。那种对于从事农业生产抱有临时观点的思想是不对的。已经投入生产而思想尚不稳定的知识青年应当弄清楚这个道理，安定下来。有些盲目奔波的应当停止，很快地投入生产。还没有参加生产的要热烈响应国家的号召，下乡和上山去！
    有些学生初下乡的时候劳动热情很高，但是，经过一个时期，他们吃不了苦，受不了累，劳动热情渐渐降低。应当指出：由于我国的工业和科学技术比较落后，在短期内还不可能大量供给农业近代化的机器装备，因而我国农业生产在一定时期内主要是依靠比较简单的生产工具和繁重的体力劳动。这是我国在向社会主义社会过渡时期中的一个历史现象。我们的任务是要改变这种状况，要把我们的国家变为一个伟大的现代化的工业国和现代化的农业国，就是说将来要以大规模的机械化的劳动代替现在比较繁重的简单劳动。要达到这样一个目的，就需要全国人民作艰苦的努力，就需要大家吃苦耐劳，需要大家自觉地从事现在这种农业体力劳动，提高劳动生产率，提高农业产量。因此，知识青年不应当在艰苦困难的面前动摇，而应当继承和发扬我国人民艰苦奋斗的优良传统，不辞辛苦地进行劳动，勇敢地克服困难。中国有句古话：“不炼不成钢”。有为的知识青年，应当经得起风吹日晒，经得起考验，应当在生产劳动的大熔炉里，把自己锻炼成为坚强的劳动者。
    有些下乡的初中、高中毕业生有一种“优越感”。他们认为自己有一定的文化科学基础知识，他们到农村是“改造”或“革新”农村的，因而有的不服从分配，工作上挑剔，有的同农民合不拢，谈不来，甚至瞧不起农民。有些地区反映：下乡参加生产的高小毕业生比初中毕业生好，初中生又比高中生好，高中毕业生难对付。河南省荥阳县有一个高中毕业生，乡里让他作农业社副社长，他摇摇头不干；让他作会计，他连头也不摇就走了。这种以“改造”者“革新”者自居，自命不凡，瞧不起农民，不服从领导的行为，是一种狂妄无知的表现。应当懂得，老一辈的农民虽然缺乏文化科学知识，但是他们有丰富的生产经验。他们所以缺乏科学知识，是由于过去受压迫受剥削，是旧社会遗留下来的。现在青年学生所以有机会读书，学得一些知识，正是由于老一辈工人、农民在党的领导下进行了艰苦的革命斗争，取得革命的胜利而获得的。青年学习文化科学基础知识，目的是用来为发展生产服务，绝不能因此而自大，以为自己了不起了。毛泽东同志早就说过：“自从有阶级的社会存在以来，世界上的知识只有两门，一门叫做生产斗争知识，一门叫做阶级斗争知识。”刚参加生产的中学生，即使他们在学校里学得一些文化科学基础知识，也只不过是书本的知识，讲到种地他们是完全无知的，比农民差的很远，是不值得引为骄傲的。对于知识青年来说，参加农业生产是生产劳动，也是一种学习，是最生动的社会主义劳动教育的一课。他们如果要“改造”和“革新”农村，首先就应当改造自己，恭恭敬敬地向农民学习。学习农民的生产经验，学习农民吃苦耐劳、勤俭朴素的优良品质，培养社会主义的劳动观点，在同农民共同生活劳动的过程中，改造自己的思想感情，去掉知识分子的坏毛病，逐步地成为一个名副其实的有文化的、有觉悟的、有生产本领的新式农民。
    党和共青团的组织尤其是乡社基层组织，应当经常地对这些参加生产的毕业生进行社会主义思想教育。目前某些地方有一种偏向，就是对于下乡学生的安排工作比较注意，生活照顾较多，但是却忽视对下乡学生的思想政治教育。妥善安排和关心他们的生活是必要的，应当的，但是不应忽视思想工作，因为思想工作是一切工作的灵魂。对于毕业生思想政治教育的具体内容，应当围绕着“热爱祖国、热爱农村、热爱劳动和爱社如家”这个中心去进行。应该组织他们参加当前农村的社会主义大辩论，通过辩论，澄清这些学生对于农业合作化、农村的前途、统购统销政策、工农生活差别等许多问题上存在的糊涂思想，提高社会主义觉悟和从事农村社会主义建设的积极性，增强他们长期从事农业生产的事业心。同时还应该根据学生的特点和思想问题，组织他们进行辩论。陕西省长安县共青团组织曾经组织府居庙乡一百三十多个知识青年，辩论下列的问题：参加农业生产是不是“屈才”？做庄稼活能不能学习和进步？辩论的效果很好。一个高小毕业生在辩论以后说：“以前鬼把心窍迷了，总认为做庄稼没出息，这一下看到了农村幸福的远景。今后一定安下心来，用自己的双手，建设美好的家乡。”
    帮助知识青年学会掌握农业生产本领，及时解决他们生活中的问题，也是使他们安心农业生产的重要措施。今年下乡的学生刚投入生产不久，他们一般缺乏体力锻炼，没有生产技能。因此，除了合理地组织安排他们的生产以外，应当积极地帮助和鼓励他们学习农民的生产经验和农业科学技术，并且尽快地学会农业生产的本领。只有这样，才能使他们对农业发生兴趣，他们在生产中才能发挥作用，才能靠他们自己的劳动所得维持生活甚至养家。这样，他们在农村生活才有物质基础，他们成家立业，长期在农村定居下来才有可能。现在，有些地区比较注意这个问题，例如有的合作社指定生产有经验的老农民向他们传授生产经验，有的地区请农业技术推广站、科普协会等向他们讲解科学生产技术等。这些是应当提倡的。
    目前有些地方下乡的学生在食、宿、记工标准、入社股金、同干部和住户之间的关系等方面，或多或少还有问题，各地应当设法解决。对于毕业生的入社股金，一般应当允许缓交，在记工标准上应当公平合理，不要歧视刚参加生产的学生。学生同干部、农民之间的关系，除了要向学生深入进行思想教育以外，对于乡社干部和农民也应当进行必要的思想工作。对于下乡的学生，他们应当本着热诚欢迎的态度，要像爱护自己的子女或者弟妹一样的关怀他们，耐心地给以帮助，主动地搞好团结。
    今年已经有大量的中小学毕业生下乡参加农业生产，这是社会主义思想教育的一个巨大胜利。但是，动员他们下乡仅仅是工作的第一步，更重要的是使他们在农村生根、开花、结果。因此，各地对于下乡学生的思想教育不能有任何放松。应当知道，做好这一工作，对于发展农业生产，对于改变社会风气都有重大的意义。我们今后既要继续动员更多的中小学毕业生下乡和上山去，同时又要巩固已经到农村中的人的劳动热情，使他们扎下根来，并且成为在农村生产建设和科学文化事业中一支积极的力量。大家应当为实现这个目标而努力。
