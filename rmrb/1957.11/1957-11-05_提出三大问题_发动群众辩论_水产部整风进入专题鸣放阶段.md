Xinhua News Agency report: The rectification movement in the Ministry of Aquatic Products has moved from a comprehensive airing of views to a new stage of focused airing of views. Based on the opinions raised by the masses, the rectification leading group of the Ministry summarized them into three special topics: the guiding principles and policies of aquatic undertakings, the system, and the organizational structure, and handed them over to the masses for discussion. Currently, the masses are launching a debate around the first topic.

In order to make the masses aware of the importance of the focused airing of views and to help them have a basis for discussing guiding principles and policies, Gao Wenhua, Vice Minister of Aquatic Products, made a report to all cadres on October 25 on the issue of the future development direction of aquatic products. The report introduced in detail the overview of the development of China's aquatic products industry, pointed out the issues that should be paid attention to when considering guiding principles and policies, and put forward the guiding principles and main indicators for aquatic products in the Second Five-Year Plan. Gao Wenhua said that China's current fisheries are basically within the scope of agriculture, a production of the broad masses of fishermen and farmers themselves, and a collective production of cooperativization. However, state-owned motorized fishing has important significance in terms of quality and cannot be biased or neglected. Therefore, the spirit of the guiding principles and policies for aquatic products in the Second Five-Year Plan should be to balance quality and quantity, combine the current reality with future development, and be both active and reliable. He asked everyone to relate to reality during the debate, and at the same time, examine the problems that existed in the past work, expose the "three majorisms" of the leadership in formulating and implementing guiding principles and policies, so as to effectively help the leadership first overcome the "three majorisms" in guiding principles and policies.

The Ministry of Aquatic Products' launch of focused airing of views is being carried out in a situation where the masses have been basically mobilized and the comprehensive airing of views has formed a climax. By the end of October, the masses had posted 534 big-character posters, totaling 1,220 person-times. Calculated based on the 370 staff members of the Ministry, an average of more than three opinions were raised per person. Among the big-character posters posted by the masses, 181 were related to guiding principles, policies, systems, organizational structures, and business. While organizing the masses for focused debates, the three rectification groups of cadres policy, administrative system, and guiding principles and policies that the Ministry had already established have also begun to deal with the relevant issues raised by the masses.

    提出三大问题　发动群众辩论
    水产部整风进入专题鸣放阶段
    新华社讯　水产部的整风运动，已从全面鸣放的基础上转入专题鸣放的新阶段。这个部的整风领导小组根据群众提出的意见，归纳为水产事业方针政策、体制和机构设置三个专题，交给群众讨论。目前群众正围绕着第一个专题展开辩论。
    为了使群众认识到专题鸣放的重要性，帮助群众在讨论方针政策时有所依据，水产部副部长高文华在10月25日向全体干部作了关于今后水产发展方针问题的报告。报告中详细地介绍我国水产事业发展的概况，指出考虑方针政策时应注意的问题，并提出第二个五年计划的水产方针和主要指标。高文华说，我国现阶段的渔业，基本上是农业的范畴，是广大渔民和农民自己的生产，是合作化的集体生产。但国营机轮渔业在质的方面有重要意义，不能偏重偏废。因之，第二个五年计划水产方针政策的精神，应该是质量兼顾，当前实际要和将来的发展结合，既要积极的，又要可靠的。他要求大家在辩论时要联系实际，同时检查过去工作上存在的问题，揭发领导上在制定和贯彻方针政策上的“三大主义”，这样才能有效地帮助领导上首先从方针政策上克服“三大主义”。
    水产部开展专题鸣放，是在群众已基本发动、全面鸣放已形成高潮的形势下进行的。到10月底，群众已贴出大字报五百三十四张，计一千二百二十人次，按这个部全体工作人员三百七十人计算，平均每人提了三条多意见。在群众贴出的大字报中，属于方针、政策、体制、机构和业务方面的有一百八十一张。在组织群众专题争辩的同时，这个部已经组成的干部政策、行政制度、方针政策三个整改小组，也动手处理群众提出的有关问题。
