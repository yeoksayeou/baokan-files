    Building a Well-Informed and Modernized Countryside
    Sichuan Develops Wired Broadcasting Network
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 13th: Sichuan's wired broadcasting network is developing rapidly. To date, Sichuan Province has installed more than 36,000 wired broadcasting loudspeakers in the vast countryside and in medium and small cities. A total of 120 counties and cities in the province have established wired broadcasting stations. In the third quarter of this year alone, the province added three broadcasting stations and more than 1,800 broadcasting loudspeakers.
    The wired broadcasting network has played an important role in promoting agricultural production, disseminating current affairs and policies and decrees, weather forecasts, and enlivening rural cultural life.
    Anhui Produces Broadcasting Communicator
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, November 14th: Anhui People's Broadcasting Station has recently successfully tested a communication tool suitable for rural areas - the "Wired Broadcasting Communicator."
    This communicator is most suitable for use between agricultural cooperatives and production teams, and between production teams.
    Based on the principle of the telephone, using the wired broadcasting lines, installing a communicator next to the wired broadcasting loudspeaker allows communication with places twenty to thirty miles away that also have wired broadcasting loudspeakers. It can also be connected to counties and districts through the post and telecommunications bureau's telephone switchboard. The installation of this communicator is very simple, requiring no additional wiring. Just purchase a communicator worth about ten yuan and two dry cell batteries to communicate.

    建设消息灵通的现代化农村
    四川发展有线广播网
    据新华社成都13日电　四川有线广播网迅速发展。到目前为止，四川省已在广大农村和中、小城市中安装了三万六千多只有线广播喇叭，全省已经有一百二十个县、市建立了有线广播站。仅在今年第三季度，全省即增加了三个广播站和一千八百多只广播喇叭。
    有线广播网在推动农业生产，传播时事和政策法令、气象预报和活跃农村文化生活等方面，都起了重要作用。
    安徽制成广播通话器
    据新华社合肥14日电　安徽人民广播电台最近试验成功了一种适用于农村的通讯工具——“有线广播通话器”。
    这种通话器最适合于农业社内社跟生产队、生产队跟生产队之间使用。
    根据电话的原理，利用有线广播的线路，在有线广播喇叭旁边安装一个通话器，就可以同相距二十——三十里的安有有线广播喇叭的地方通话，也可以通过邮电局的电话总机转接至县、区。安装这种通话器非常简便，不必再拉线路，只要买一个价值十几元的通话器和两节手电池就可以通话了。
