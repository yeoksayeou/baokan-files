	Button
	Dong Yanshou

	You've asked me more than once why I particularly like this button, why I treasure it so. You said you can't see any difference between it and other buttons. How could you know that this isn't an ordinary button!

	Seven years ago, I worked in a factory in Shenyang, I was only seventeen years old then. A piece of good news came: a Soviet expert was coming to our factory.

	Everyone was excited by this news. How we hoped that a Soviet expert would come to our factory to work! At that time, our factory had just been taken over, it was dilapidated, and we spent all day in the workshop repairing machines. Many problems couldn't be solved, and we couldn't start work for a long time. We believed that with a Soviet expert, our factory would soon be put into production.

	After work, the workshop director ran over to us and said, "Don't leave, everyone, the factory director is coming to the workshop with the expert."

	No one left, everyone turned their eyes to the door, staring at it intently. The factory director walked in with a Soviet female comrade. She was wearing a light blue woolen coat, not too tall, not too short, her hair was a bit gray, she looked about fifty years old, and a pair of deep blue eyes made people feel gentle and kind.

	We applauded warmly, rushing up to surround the factory director and the expert. The expert could speak Chinese, quite fluently. She smiled and said to us: "Hello, comrades!"

	We answered loudly: "Hello!"

	The expert turned her head and said to the factory director: "With such a group of strong young men, what can't be done well!"

	Everyone laughed when they heard this.

	From that day on, the expert became an indispensable mentor, comrade, and friend in our lives. The expert's real name was Nadya. We called her Comrade Nadya to her face, and Nadya Mama behind her back, because she was so kind to us, caring for us and helping us with every little thing from work to life. Once, a comrade had his arm crushed by a lathe, and the expert personally applied medicine and washed his wound. This comrade was moved to tears, he tightly held the expert's hand and said: "Comrade Nadya, you are too good."

	The expert smiled and said: "It's nothing, child, be careful in the future and don't have any more accidents."

	One winter evening, Shenyang was covered in heavy snow, a vast expanse of white everywhere, the weather was so cold that people only wanted to stay by the stove. After finishing the night shift, I came out of the workshop, holding the work pieces in my hands, ready to send them to the inspection team. My cotton coat was made last year, and a button on the collar had fallen off. The wind blew, and the collar opened up, the cold air directly pressing on my body, freezing my tears and snot all over my face, and my hands were inconvenient, I couldn't even pull up my collar. Walking to the door of the expert's room, I saw that there was still light inside. I knew the expert was still working, so I lightened my footsteps, so as not to disturb her. Just as I was about to walk past, the door suddenly opened, and the expert came out of the room. She looked at my face, then at my collar, and understood everything. She said gently: "Come in, child, wait a moment before you go."

	I obediently followed her in, she told me to put down the work pieces and sit on her bed. After I sat down, she complained: "Why are you so careless about your body, the weather is very cold, you should quickly sew on the button when it falls off."

	I said embarrassedly: "I forgot when I went out, I'll sew it on when I get back."

	"That won't do," she said, "There's still a long way to your place. Take it off, I'll sew it on for you."

	This was really beyond my expectations, I didn't know what to say. The expert, without waiting for me to answer, turned around and opened the small leather bag on her table. The leather bag contained needles, thread, and some daily necessities. She took out the needle and thread, but couldn't find a suitable button after searching for a long time. She thought for a moment, then suddenly bent down and dragged a leather suitcase out from under the bed. She opened the suitcase and took out a man's woolen coat. This coat was already very old, with only one button left, and a large hole in the chest, obviously pierced by something. The expert looked at this coat for a long time, the expression on her face becoming more and more serious, her eyes seemed to be filled with tears. I stared blankly at her, forgetting the few words I originally wanted to say.

	She slowly cut off the button from the coat, and then put it back into the suitcase. The usual expression returned to her face, but I could see that she was trying to control herself. She saw that I hadn't taken off my coat yet, and said angrily: "Why are you so disobedient, take it off!"

	I had no choice but to take off my coat. The expert's room was very warm, but she still gave me her coat and told me to put it on. The expert put on her glasses and sewed it on stitch by stitch under the lamp. Ah! I really can't make you understand how excited I was at that time, only a child who is far away from his mother, when he returns to his mother's arms, can understand my mood at that time.

	While sewing the button, the expert talked to me, she asked me: "Who else is there in your family?" I said: "Just me."

	"What about your mother?"

	"Dead." I lowered my head sadly.

	"What! Child, you no longer have a mother?"

	"Yes, she's dead, killed by the Japanese."

	"Ah! Child!" The expert put the needle, thread, and coat on the table, held my shoulders with both hands, and looked at me with sympathy. Her eyes were so gentle and touching, I couldn't help but call out: "Nadya Mama!"

	"Nadya Mama! Yes, I am your mother." The expert hugged me in her arms, and said excitedly: "I also had a child like you, he sacrificed on the battlefield to defend his country, that coat was his, his comrades sent it back to me from a very far place when he died, I always carry it with me, as if carrying my child."

	From that day on, I went to see the expert every day after work. I not only called her Mama behind her back, but also called her Mama to her face. She was even better and more caring for me than before, she encouraged me to be progressive, taught me how to be a real person, and whenever I did something wrong, she would severely criticize me. One day, I broke two screws on the car because I was joking with a comrade next to me, and she found out. When I went to her room that night, she looked at me sternly, so much so that I didn't dare to lift my head. She said: "I know you are very naughty, but you can't be naughty at work! Do you know what you did today?"

	I said with extreme remorse: "I was wrong!"

	"Wrong! That's of course very good, but recognizing your mistakes isn't just a sentence."

	I was extremely sad, and almost cried as I said: "Please believe me, Nadya Mama, I will never have an accident again in the future."

	"Okay," the expert said, "I'll watch your actions."

	Really! From that time on, I haven't had an accident, and I'm not as naughty as I used to be, when I'm working, I work wholeheartedly, and as long as I'm a little distracted, I look at that button (I always carry that button with me), and I say to myself: "Don't make a mistake! Nadya Mama is watching you!"

	The following year, the organization decided to send me to Beijing to study. On the day I left, my heart was filled with an unspeakable emotion, I was really sad, but I knew the expert didn't like others to shed tears, so I held back. The expert said to me: "Study hard, child, Mama is waiting to see your results."

	I nodded, silently looking at her.

	The train started, Nadya Mama stood on the platform waving goodbye to me, the wind from the train blew her hair up, she was still panting, her chest rising and falling, I will never forget that waving hand, that gray hair….

	Time really flies, now I'm already in university, and Nadya Mama went back to the Soviet Union three years after I left the factory. She often writes to me, she hopes to see me again one day. Every time I see this button, it's like seeing her standing in front of me.

	This is the origin of the button, you say, how can I not cherish it, how can I not cherish it?

    钮扣
    董延寿
    你不止一次问我为什么特别喜欢这颗钮扣，这样珍藏着它，你说，你看不出它跟别的钮扣有什么两样，你哪里知道，这不是一颗平常的钮扣呀！
    七年前，我在沈阳一个工厂里工作，那时我还只十七岁。传来一个好消息：咱们厂里来了个苏联专家。
    每个人都被这消息所激动，我们多盼望苏联专家到我们厂里来工作呀！那时，我们的工厂刚接收过来，破破烂烂，我们整天在车间里修理机器，许多问题无法解决，长久不能开工，我们相信，有了苏联专家我们的工厂很快地就能投入生产了。
    下班时候，车间主任跑来对我们说：“大家别走，厂长陪着专家到车间来了。”
    谁也不走了，大家把眼光一齐转向门口，紧紧地盯着那儿。厂长陪着个苏联女同志走进来了，她穿着件浅蓝色的呢大衣，个子不高不矮，头发有些灰白，看起来大概有五十岁左右，一双深蓝色的眼睛使人感到温和而又亲切。
    我们热烈地鼓掌，涌上去把厂长和专家围起来。专家会说中国话，说得满流利。她笑着对我们说：“同志们好！”
    我们大声回答：“您好！”
    专家转过头去对厂长说：“有这么一批精壮小伙子，什么事情办不好！”
    大家一听，全笑了。
    从这一天起，专家就成了我们生活中不可缺少的导师，同志，朋友。专家的本名叫娜嘉，我们当面叫她娜嘉同志，背地里都叫她娜嘉妈妈，因为她对我们那样亲切，从工作到生活，每一件小事她都关心我们，帮助我们。有一次，一个同志被车床压坏了手臂，专家亲自给他上药，洗伤口，这个同志感动得流泪，他紧紧地握着专家的手说：“娜嘉同志，您太好了。”
    专家却笑着说：“没有什么，孩子，以后注意点，别再出事故了。”
    一个冬天的晚上，沈阳飘着鹅毛大雪，远近上下都是白茫茫的一片，天气冷得叫人只想呆在火炉边。我做完夜班，从车间走出来，手里抱着活路，准备送到检验组那里去。我的棉衣是去年做的，领上的一颗钮扣掉了，风一吹，领就张开来，寒气往身上直逼，冷得我眼泪鼻涕满脸流，手又不方便，连拉一下衣领都不行。走到专家房间门口，看见里面还有灯光，我知道专家还在工作，于是把脚步放轻，免得打扰了她。正要走过去，房门突然打开了，专家从房间里走出来，她看看我的脸，再看看我的衣领，心里全明白了。她温和地说：“进来，孩子，等一等再走。”
    我顺从地跟着她走进去，她叫我把活路放下，坐在她的床上。我坐下后，她埋怨地说：“为什么这样不注意身体，天气很冷，钮扣掉了就该赶快钉上。”
    我不好意思地说：“出门时忘了，回去就钉上。”
    “那怎么行，”她说，“到你住的地方还有好一段路呢。脱下来，我给你钉。”
    这真出乎我的意外，我不知说什么才好。专家不等我回答，就转过身去把她桌上的小皮包打开，皮包里装着针线和一些日常用的东西。她取出针线，但找来找去也找不到一颗合适的钮扣。她想了一想，突然弯下腰去从床下拖出一只皮箱来，她打开皮箱，从里面取出一件男子穿的呢大衣。这件大衣已经很破旧了，只剩下一颗钮扣，胸部有个大洞，显然是被什么东西打穿的。专家对着这件大衣看了很久，脸上的表情越来越严肃，眼里好像还含着泪水。我呆呆地看着她，把本来想说的几句话都忘了。
    她慢慢地从大衣上剪下那颗钮扣，又把它放进皮箱去了。她脸上又恢复了平常的表情，但我看得出来，她在努力控制自己。她见我还没有脱下大衣，生气地说：“怎么这样不听话，脱下来！”
    我只好把大衣脱下来。专家的房里很暖和，但是她还是把她的大衣给我，叫我披起来。专家戴上眼镜，在灯下一针一针地缝起来。啊！我真无法叫你明白那时我是怎样的激动，只有一个远离母亲的孩子，重新回到母亲怀里的时候，才能体会我那时的心情。
    专家一面钉钮扣，一面和我谈话，她问我：“家里还有什么人？”我说：“就我一个。”
    “妈妈呢？”
    “死了。”我难过地低下了头。
    “怎么！孩子，你已经没有妈妈了？”
    “是的，她死了，给日本人杀死的。”
    “啊！孩子！”专家把针线和大衣放在桌上，两手扶着我的肩膀，同情地看着我。她的眼睛是那么柔和，感人，我情不自禁地叫了一声：“娜嘉妈妈！”
    “娜嘉妈妈！对，我是你们的妈妈。”专家把我抱在怀里，激动地说：“我也有过像你这样的一个孩子，他为了保卫他的祖国，在战场上牺牲了，那件大衣就是他的，他死的时候还穿着它，他的战友从很远的地方把它寄来给我，我一直带在身旁，好像带着我的孩子。”
    从那天起，我每天下班都去看专家，我不仅背后叫她妈妈，当面也叫她妈妈。她对我也比以前更好，更关心，她鼓励我上进，教给我怎样做一个真正的人，每当我做错了事情，她就严厉地批评我。有一天，我因为和旁边的一个同志开玩笑，车坏了两颗螺丝钉，被她知道了。晚上我到她房里，她严峻地看着我，看得我不敢抬起头来。她说：“我知道你很顽皮，可是你不能在工作时也顽皮呀！你知道今天你做了些什么？”
    我异常悔恨地说：“我错了！”
    “错了！这当然很好，不过认识错误并不只是一句话。”
    我难过极了，几乎是哭着说：“请您相信我，娜嘉妈妈，以后我再也不出事故了。”
    “好吧，”专家说，“我看你的行动。”
    真的！从这一次以后我就没有出过事故，我也不再像过去那么顽皮了，工作时我就全心全意的工作，只要稍一分心，我就看看那颗钮扣（我一直把那颗钮扣带在身边），我对自己说：“别犯错误呀！娜嘉妈妈看着你呢！”
    第二年，组织上决定送我到北京学习。走的那天，我心里充满了一种说不出来的感情，我真难过，但我知道专家不喜欢别人流眼泪，于是我忍住了。专家对我说：“好好的学习，孩子，妈妈等着看你的成绩。”
    我点点头，默默无言地看着她。
    列车开动了，娜嘉妈妈站在月台上挥手向我告别，列车带动的风把她的头发吹得飘起来，她还在喘息，胸脯一起一伏的，我永远忘不了那挥动着的手，那灰白色的头发……。
    时间过得真快，现在我已经读大学了，娜嘉妈妈也在我离开工厂后的第三年回苏联去了。她常常给我来信，她希望有一天再见到我。我每次看见这颗钮扣，就好像看见她站在我面前。
    这就是钮扣的来历，你说，我怎么能不珍爱它，我怎么能不珍爱它呢？
