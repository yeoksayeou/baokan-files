Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 15th: The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, connecting the natural barrier between North and South, now sees a train passing on average less than once an hour. In the month since the bridge officially opened on October 15th, more than 200,000 passengers have crossed the Yangtze in comfortable passenger carriages. Freight trains, which started operating ten days later, have transported nearly 800,000 tons of materials in twenty days, including steel, machinery, and coal from the North, and timber, nan bamboo, and rice from the South. The days when gales and fog disrupted traffic between the North and South of the Yangtze River are gone forever.

Although the railway hub project in the Wuhan area has not been completed, which prevents the full utilization of the Yangtze River Bridge's train capacity, the Yangtze River Bridge is already significantly accelerating the exchange of materials between the North and South of the country, and shortening the distance between the two regions. For freight trains traveling south along the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, except for a small portion of materials arriving in Wuchang that still rely on train ferries to cross the river temporarily, the average dwell time for each freight car in the Wuhan area is now more than six hours shorter than in the past. According to estimates from the railway department in the Wuhan area, the cost saved by freight trains crossing the Yangtze River Bridge compared to the past can repay the construction investment of the main bridge in about five years. At the same time, the millions of passengers traveling between Beijing and Guangzhou, and between Beijing and Pingxiang, are also saving more than two hours of travel time compared to before.

Hundreds and thousands of Wuhan residents now cross the Yangtze River Bridge every day, rain or shine, to reach their work and study places.

    武汉长江大桥通车一月
    二十多万旅客乘车越过长江
    南北交流的钢材、大米等物资近八十万吨
    据新华社武汉15日电　沟通南北天堑的武汉长江大桥，现在平均不到一小时就有一趟列车驶过。从10月15日大桥正式通车后的一个月来，已经有二十多万旅客，坐在舒适的客车厢里越过长江；比客车迟十天通车的货运列车，二十天来通过大桥运输的北方的钢材、机器、煤炭和南方的木材、楠竹、大米等物资，也已接近八十万吨。狂风、迷雾打断长江南北交通的日子，已经永远成为过去了。
    虽然由于武汉地区铁路枢纽工程没有竣工，使长江大桥的火车通过能力还不能充分发挥，但是，长江大桥已经在显著地加速着祖国南北的物资交流，缩短了大江南北的距离。沿京广路南驶的货运列车，除了一小部分到达武昌的物资暂时依靠火车轮渡过江外，每辆货车现在在武汉地区的停留时间，平均比过去缩短了六个多小时。据武汉地区铁道部门概算，单是货运列车通过长江大桥比过去节约的费用，约五年左右就可以换回长江大桥正桥的建设投资。同时，每天往来于北京—广州、北京—凭祥之间的千千万万的旅客，也都比以前节省了两个多小时的旅行时间。
    成百上千的武汉人，每天更是风雨无阻地通过长江大桥，走上他们的工作、学习岗位。
