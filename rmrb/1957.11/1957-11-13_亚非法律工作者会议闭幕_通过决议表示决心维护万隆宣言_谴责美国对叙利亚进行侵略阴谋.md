Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 12th. The Asian-African Legal Workers Conference closed on the evening of November 11th. The conference passed resolutions on issues of universal concern, such as world peace, military alliances, and bases.

    The resolution on world peace stated: "The conference solemnly expresses its support for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by the Prime Ministers of China and India." The resolution also stated that the Bandung Conference Declaration is "the charter of peace for Asian and African countries. We, the legal workers of Asia and Africa, are determined to uphold this charter."

    The resolution pointed out: "The Eisenhower Doctrine and the Baghdad Pact are typical manifestations of imperialism, because they not only constitute a threat to the national independence of Arab countries and other countries in the Near and Middle East, but also a threat to peace in the Middle East and the entire world. The conference condemns the actions of the US aggressive bloc that is implementing the Eisenhower Doctrine, especially the conspiracy of this aggressive bloc to instigate Turkey and Israel to launch armed aggression against Syria. The conference pledges its full support for the just struggle of the Arab and Syrian people against imperialism and to safeguard their national independence."

    The resolution also stated that the conference believes that imperialists are still infringing upon the national rights of countries in the Middle East and Africa. "The conference strongly condemns these illegal actions and supports the just struggle of Algeria, Oman, Yemen, Cyprus, and the Asian and African people to win and safeguard national independence."

    The resolution pointed out: "The conference believes that excluding the People's Republic of China, which truly represents nearly a quarter of the world's population, from the United Nations means that the United Nations organization does not truly represent all the people of the world. Therefore, the conference calls on Asian and African countries to adopt proposals advocating the restoration of the legitimate and rightful seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations." The conference also believes that Mongolia has the absolute right to join the United Nations.

    The resolution stated: "In order to achieve coexistence, the conference believes that all countries in the world should promptly reach agreements on issues such as the prohibition of the manufacture, use, and testing of nuclear weapons, disarmament, the abolition of military blocs and military treaties, and the withdrawal of troops and military bases on the territory of other countries." The resolution said: "In order to promote peaceful coexistence, the conference believes that active steps should be taken to expand international trade, increase mutual visits, develop cultural exchanges, and promote economic cooperation between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit."

    The resolution pointed out, "On the issue of the peaceful, independent and reunification of Korea and Vietnam, the imperialists have violated international agreements and obligations. The conference also believes that the reunification of Korea and Vietnam by the people of Korea and Vietnam respectively in accordance with international agreements and obligations is a necessary step to maintain peace."

    The conference passed special resolutions on Korea and Vietnam. The resolution on Korea pointed out that the United States' shipment of new weapons into South Korea is a serious violation of international law, and this violation is a serious threat to world peace.

    A resolution on military conventions pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact are all threats to world peace.

    In addition, special resolutions on supporting a policy of active neutrality and nationalization, as well as resolutions on national self-determination, the definition of aggression, and the Palestine issue were also adopted. The resolution on unequal treaties stated that "countries forced to sign such treaties have the right to free themselves from the shackles of such treaties by means of abolishing them."

    The head of the Egyptian delegation, on behalf of the Egyptian Lawyers Union, invited the next Asian-African Legal Workers Conference to be held in Cairo. This invitation was accepted on the evening of the 11th.

    Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali awarded the Syrian Order of Merit, First Class, to the heads of each delegation on the 10th, as a reward for their efforts and achievements.

    亚非法律工作者会议闭幕
    通过决议表示决心维护万隆宣言
    谴责美国对叙利亚进行侵略阴谋
    新华社大马士革12日电　亚非法律工作者会议在11月11日晚上闭幕。会议通过了关于世界和平、关于军事联盟和基地等受到普遍关心的问题的决议。
    关于世界和平的决议中说：“会议郑重表示赞成中国和印度两国总理所倡议的和平共处的五项原则。”决议还说，万隆会议宣言是“亚非国家的和平宪章。我们亚洲和非洲的法律工作者决心维护这个宪章”。
    决议指出：“艾森豪威尔主义和巴格达条约是帝国主义的典型表现，因为它们不仅构成了对阿拉伯国家和中近东其他国家的民族独立的威胁，而且也是对中东和整个世界的和平的威胁。会议谴责正在执行艾森豪威尔主义的美国侵略集团的行动，特别是这一侵略集团策动土耳其和以色列对叙利亚发动武装侵略的阴谋。会议保证充分支持阿拉伯和叙利亚人民的反对帝国主义、维护自己的民族独立的正义斗争。”
    决议还说，会议认为帝国主义者仍然在侵犯中东和非洲国家的民族权利。“会议强烈谴责这些非法行动，并且支持阿尔及利亚、阿曼、也门、塞浦路斯和亚非人民为争取和维护民族独立而进行的正义斗争。”
    决议指出：“会议认为，把真正代表人口占全世界将近四分之一的中国人民的中华人民共和国阻挡在联合国之外，意味着联合国组织并没有真正代表世界上所有的人民。因此，会议要求亚非国家通过主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国内的合法和应有地位的建议。”会议还认为蒙古绝对有权利进入联合国。
    决议说：“为了实现共处，会议认为世界上的各国应该迅速就禁止制造、使用和试验核武器、裁减军备、废除军事集团和军事条约以及撤退在别国领土上的军队和军事基地等问题达成协议。”决议说：“为了促进和平共处，会议认为应该采取积极的步骤在平等互利的基础上扩大国际贸易、增加相互访问、发展文化交流以及促进各国经济合作。”
    决议指出，“在朝鲜和越南的和平、独立和重新统一的问题上，帝国主义者违反了国际协定和义务。会议也认为朝鲜和越南的人民按照国际协定和义务分别实现重新统一是保持和平的一个必要步骤。”
    会议通过了关于朝鲜和越南的特别决议。关于朝鲜的决议指出，美国把新武器运入南朝鲜是对国际公法的严重侵犯，而这种侵犯是对世界和平的严重威胁。
    关于军事公约的一项决议指出，北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约都是对世界和平的威胁。
    此外还通过了关于支持积极中立政策和国有化的特别决议，以及关于民族自决、侵略的定义和巴勒斯坦问题的决议。关于不平等条约的决议说，“被迫签订这种条约的国家有权利以废除的办法来解脱这种条约的束缚。”
    埃及代表团团长代表埃及律师联合会邀请下次亚非法律工作者会议在开罗举行。这个邀请在11日晚上被接受了。
    叙利亚总理阿萨利10日把叙利亚一级功勋勋章授与各个代表团团长，作为对他们的努力和成就的奖励。
