In early July this year, on a hot evening, Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, playwright Xia Yan, Greek literature expert Luo Niansheng, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of People's Literature Publishing House Lou Shiyi, and I sat around the living room of the Beijing Peace Hotel, waiting for guests.

Several guests from Greece, who could also be said to be "rare guests," entered accompanied by comrades from the reception and translation teams. We stood up to greet them and offered them seats. I saw an elderly guest, tall, not too fat, but in good spirits. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, not afraid of the electric fan blowing from all directions. This was the famous contemporary Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis. This time he and his wife came to China for a visit. In addition, there were two other Greek guests – economist Avepeti and his wife. After exchanging greetings, the conversation immediately turned to the state of Chinese literature and the introduction of Greek literature in China, among other issues.

Mr. Kazantzakis, the elderly, prolific, highly cultured, and politically progressive modern writer who was with us that evening, was famous in Greece (and beyond). Born in 1885, he was now in his seventies. He studied law in Athens and philosophy in Paris. He traveled to many places throughout his life, with footprints all over Europe, and had been to some countries in Africa and Asia, and had been to China a long time ago. In 1927, he visited the Soviet Union.

Mr. Kazantzakis himself created a large number of literary works, in a variety of genres. He has engaged in all literary forms: lyric and narrative poetry, poetic dramas, novels, travelogues, philosophy, essays, and foreign literature translations. Tragedies written in poetic form include more than ten works such as "The Master," "The Prometheus Trilogy," "Ulysses," "Yangtze River," "Columbus," and "The Bee." Narrative poems include "The Odyssey." Novels include "Zorba the Greek," "Captain Michalis," "The Greek Passion," "The Last Temptation," "God's Pauper," "He Wants Freedom, Kill Him" ... and other books. His works have very rich language and a beautiful style. In recent years, his works have been translated into many languages. He himself has also translated many world literary classics. He loves Russian literature and is recognized as one of the researchers with extensive knowledge of Russian literature.

In all his recent works, articles and talks, Mr. Kazantzakis has expressed his confidence in progressive forces. In a conversation, he said when talking about writers: "Writers can be divided into three categories. Some represent and describe the corruption of the world, they depict ugly things, incest, rape, etc. Secondly, there are a group of people who escape from reality, they are nostalgic for the past... Finally, there is a group of writers who try their best to see the face of future civilization and want to understand the structure of future society. What interests me is the third category."

Carefully savoring these words, one cannot help but think that in the struggle between the bourgeois and proletarian roads in our literary and art circles, we have also seen the first and second categories of writers as Kazantzakis said. And if the third type of writers, who he is interested in, want to see the face of future civilization and understand the structure of future society, I think only by "truthfully and historically concretely describing reality in actual revolutionary development" can be the best creative method. This is: the creative method of socialist realism. Kazantzakis's statement is different, but his understanding is consistent with socialist realism. I think this is why Kazantzakis has become one of the greatest modern Greek writers.

Kazantzakis is also a social and political activist and peace fighter. In 1955, the World Peace Council awarded him the International Peace Prize. At the award ceremony, Kazantzakis said:

"…As a man, a writer, I have strived to fight for freedom, peace and human dignity… The means of destruction have reached a terrifying level, and the edge of science has long placed magic in the hands of apes… If we want the world not to be destroyed, we must liberate the love trapped in the hearts of human beings, just as we release the potential power of things. … Freedom and peace are constantly threatened. We must constantly mobilize all our strength to defend them, and we must always stand on the side of freedom and peace. We were born in such a time, a world is crumbling, and another world is thriving. We are watching a kaleidoscope mixed with destruction and construction. Therefore, today ‘man’ shoulders a huge responsibility, he knows that all people, regardless of white, yellow, or black, stand together. If people are starving on the other side of the earth, then we are responsible. If someone is enslaved in a corner of the world, then we cannot be free…"

How earnest these words are!

After visiting our country, Mr. Kazantzakis fell ill on his way back. In early and mid-October, the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace corresponded with his wife, Ms. Helen, several times to inquire and offer condolences. One telegram said, "We are very moved by the concern of the China Peace Committee. We will never forget your brotherly reception. Health is slowly but surely improving." The next day, October 5, his wife wrote again: "Because he cannot use his right hand, I am writing to you in his name... He also asked me to tell you that he has not been idle these days... On the contrary, he will try his best to accept new things. He only regrets not being able to write about the liberated and eternal China, which today has become the new motherland for all of us.” The letter also said: “Whether our eyes are open or closed, our eyes are filled with images of China. From Beijing to Guangdong, from Chongqing to Kunming, we felt your meticulous care everywhere and every moment. Never has a trip been more beautiful. At the moment of parting, our hearts have never been so grief-stricken." "Please forgive me for not being able to fully express our deep gratitude and admiration in this letter. Kazantzakis may be able to express to you better why we feel like we owe you a debt. However, he will not be able to hold a pen again for two or three months. Please accept our best wishes. Helen Kazantzakis. October 14, 1957, Freiburg University Hospital."

From these enthusiastic and sincere words, we can see how much Mr. Kazantzakis and his wife loved our country and people. It can also be seen how righteous our friends are. Unexpectedly, just as we were anxiously waiting for good news, we received a telegram from Mrs. Kazantzakis from Cannes, France, on October 30, stating that Mr. Kazantzakis had passed away and that the funeral would be held in early November in Heraklion, Crete, Greece – his hometown… This bad news made us extremely saddened! The world's progressive cultural and peace cause has lost an outstanding fighter. The broad masses of the Chinese people have lost a loyal friend. We can only work hard to defend world peace, inherit and carry forward his progressive literary cause, and strengthen the friendship between the people of China and Greece, to commemorate Mr. Kazantzakis. Kazantzakis will live forever in the hearts of the people!

    悼念希腊名作家卡桑萨基
    萧三
    今年7月初一个炎热的晚上，中国作家协会主席茅盾、剧作家夏衍、希腊文学专家罗念生、人民文学出版社副社长楼适夷和我，围坐在北京和平宾馆的客厅里，等待着客人。
    几位从希腊来的远客，同时也可说是“稀客”，由招待和翻译的同志陪同进来了。我们起立迎接、让坐。只见一位年长的客人，个子高高的，体格不算胖，但精神很好。他身穿一件短袖的衬衣，一点也不怕电扇的风从许多方面袭来。这就是当代著名的希腊作家尼科斯·卡桑萨基先生。这次他和他的夫人同来中国访问。此外还有两位希腊客人——经济学家艾威彼蒂和他的夫人。我们彼此寒喧了一番之后，谈话立即转入中国文学的状况和希腊文学在中国的介绍工作等等问题。
    这个晚上和我们在一起的、在希腊（不仅在希腊）享有盛名的、多产的、文化修养很高、政治思想进步的现代老作家——卡桑萨基先生生于1885年，现在七十多岁了。他在雅典学过法律，在巴黎攻过哲学。他一生旅行过许多地方，足迹遍及整个欧洲，到过非洲和亚洲一些国家，并且在很久以前就到过中国。1927年他去过苏联。
    卡桑萨基先生自己的文学创作数量很多，种类也不少。他从事过所有的文学体裁：抒情诗和叙事诗、诗剧、小说、游记、哲学、论文和外国文学翻译。用诗的形式写的悲剧有：“主人”、“普罗米修斯悲剧三部曲”、“尤利塞斯”、“扬子江”、“哥伦布”、“蜜蜂”等十多部。叙事诗有“奥第赛”。小说有：“希腊人左尔巴”、“米查勒斯船长”、“希腊的热情”、“最后的考验”、“上帝的可怜人”、“他要自由，杀死他”……等书。他的作品具有非常丰富的语言和优美的风格。近年来他的作品曾译成许多国家的文字。他自己也翻译过许多世界文学名著。他喜爱俄国文学，被公认为是对俄国文学有渊博知识的研究者之一。
    在他所有最近的作品里，所有的文章和谈话里，卡桑萨基先生都表示出他对进步力量的信心。在一次谈话中他谈到作家时说：“作家可以分成三类。有一些人代表和描述世界的腐朽，他们描写丑恶事物，乱伦，强奸等等。其次，有一批逃避现实的人，他们留恋过去……最后，还有一批作家，他们竭力想看出未来的文明的面目，并想了解未来社会的结构。使我感到兴趣的是第三类”。
    细细玩味这些话语，不禁使人想起，在我们文艺界进行资产阶级和无产阶级两条道路的斗争里，也看见了如同卡桑萨基所说的第一类和第二类作家。而使他感到兴趣的第三类作家，他们如果要想看出未来文明的面目，并想了解未来社会的结构，我想只有“真实地、历史具体地在实际的革命发展里去描写实际”，才是最好的创作方法。这就是：社会主义现实主义的创作方法。卡桑萨基的说法不同，但他的领会是和社会主义现实主义相一致的。我想，这也就是卡桑萨基之所以成为现代希腊最伟大的作家之一的缘故。
    卡桑萨基同时又是一个社会的、政治的活动家与和平战士。1955年世界和平理事会授与他以国际和平奖金。在受奖的仪式会上卡桑萨基说道：
    “……作为一个人，一个作家，我曾发奋为自由、和平与人类的尊严而斗争……毁灭性的手段已达到令人胆战心惊的地步，科学的锋刃早已将魔力置于人猿手中……如果我们希望世界不至于遭到毁灭，我们必须将被困在人类心中的爱解脱出来，就像我们将事物的潜在力量释放出来一样。……自由与和平不断受到威胁。我们必须时刻动员我们的一切力量，保卫它们，我们必须永远站在自由与和平的一边。我们就是生在这样一个时候，一个世界在摇摇欲坠，另一个世界却正在欣欣向荣。我们在看着一个夹杂着毁灭和建设的万花筒。因此今天‘人’肩负着巨大的责任，他知道一切人们，不分白、黄、黑色都站在一起。如果在地球的另一端的人在挨饿，那么我们就应负责。如果在世界的某一个角落有人被奴役，那我们就不能获得自由……”
    这些都是多么语重心长的话呀！
    卡桑萨基先生访问了我国之后，在回去的途中病倒了。10月初和月中我保卫世界和平委员会曾和他的夫人海伦女士几次函电往来，探询慰问。有一次来电说，“我们对于中国和平委员会的关注，十分感动。我们将永远不忘你们兄弟般的接待。健康在缓慢地但可靠地好转”。第二天，10月5日，他的夫人又来信说：“由于他不能够使用右手，我以他的名义给你们写信……他还要我告诉你们，他一点也没有闲过这些日子……正相反，他将尽力使自己接受新的东西。他只是觉得遗憾不能写出关于解放了的和永恒的中国的情况，这个中国今天成了我们大家新的祖国。”信中又说：“无论张开或闭上眼睛，我们的眼前都充满着中国的景象。从北京到广东，从重庆到昆明，我们到处、每时每刻都感到你们无微不至的关怀。从来没有一次旅行比它更美的了。临别的时刻，我们的心从来没有这样悲戚欲裂的”。“请原谅我这封信还未能尽情地表达我们深切的感激和仰慕。卡桑萨基或许能更好地向你们表达，为什么我们觉得像对你们欠下了债似的。但是，他总要在两三个月以后才能重新握笔。请接受我们最良好的心意。海伦·卡桑萨基。1957年10月14日，弗莱堡大学医院”。
    从这些热情诚挚的字句，我们可以看出，卡桑萨基先生和他的夫人对我们国家和人民是怎样热爱的。也可看出，我们的朋友是如何地富有正义感。不料正当焦灼地盼望佳音之际，我们收到卡桑萨基夫人10月30日从法国戛纳来电称，卡桑萨基先生已经逝世，将于11月初在希腊克里特岛希拉克令——他的故乡——举行葬礼……这一噩耗使得我们异常沉痛！世界进步文化事业与和平事业失去了一位卓越的战士。广大中国人民失去了一位忠诚的朋友。我们只有努力保卫世界和平，继承并发扬他的进步文学事业，加强中希两国人民之间的友谊，来纪念卡桑萨基先生。卡桑萨基永远活在人民的心里！
