Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 22nd: Shaanxi Province has overfulfilled this year's water conservancy project plan. According to statistics from mid-November, the province has expanded its irrigated area by 2.95 million mu, exceeding this year's original plan by 47.5%. Water conservancy construction has proceeded rapidly, with 1.43 million mu of irrigated area expanded in just the first and middle ten days of November.

The mass movement for water conservancy construction is continuing to develop, but the development is uneven. Some cadres have begun to develop complacency and a slackening of effort. Problems such as the winter water conservancy construction plan, project quality, labor organization, and other production arrangements urgently need to be resolved. To this end, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) held a telephone conference on November 20th for the secretaries of the forty county and city CCP committees in Guanzhong.

The person in charge of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CCP pointed out at the meeting that to ensure the widespread and in-depth development of the current mass winter water conservancy and other production campaigns, in addition to overcoming the complacency and relaxation of a small number of cadres and strengthening specific organizational leadership, it is also necessary to make this winter's water conservancy construction plan more substantial and complete. At present, some areas have only focused on new water conservancy projects, while paying insufficient attention to the repair and maintenance of existing water conservancy facilities; some areas have focused on water conservancy construction in areas with better conditions, while neglecting water conservancy construction, soil and water conservation, and soil moisture preservation work in areas with more difficult conditions; some areas emphasize irrigation projects while downplaying drainage projects; some focus on building canals and digging wells, while neglecting the installation of waterwheels and preparation for winter irrigation. The person in charge said that in addition to continuing to focus on new water conservancy projects, all localities should also pay attention to the utilization rate of existing water conservancy facilities. Soil and water conservation, moisture preservation, and drainage should be regarded as equally important components of basic water conservancy construction. All localities should check this winter's water conservancy plans village by village and commune by commune, and make appropriate arrangements based on local conditions.

The Provincial Party Committee official pointed out that attention must be paid to the quality of water conservancy projects. The main method to improve project quality is to consult with the masses more. Some localities have adopted the experience of "local engineer" symposiums, inviting experienced farmers as consultants, and organizing visits, which should continue to be promoted. At the same time, a check and acceptance system must be implemented, striving to ensure that this winter's water conservancy projects are "built and completed," and "completed and used."

The official said that the current water conservancy construction must be closely integrated with winter irrigation. This autumn, the province carried out drought-resistant sowing, but the soil moisture is insufficient, so timely winter irrigation and spring irrigation are crucial to strive for a bumper harvest next year. In addition to fully utilizing the equipment capacity of existing water conservancy projects for irrigation, efforts should also be made to ensure that most of the newly built water conservancy projects can catch up with winter irrigation. All localities must arrange and organize labor well, and strive to achieve "canals built, land leveled, and water available," irrigating as you build, irrigating every possible mu, and not neglecting small-scale irrigation.

The official also proposed that it is necessary to overcome the "single-minded" work method of only focusing on water conservancy while neglecting other winter production.

### 陕西兴修水利计划已超额完成  省委指出应当克服不平衡现象防止自满松劲情绪

    陕西兴修水利计划已超额完成
    省委指出应当克服不平衡现象防止自满松劲情绪
    据新华社西安22日电　陕西省已经超额完成今年兴修水利的计划。据11月中旬的统计，全省已经扩大灌溉面积二百九十五万亩，超过今年原订计划47．5％。兴修水利的速度很快，仅11月上、中旬全省就扩大灌溉面积一百四十三万亩。
    现在，群众性的兴修水利运动正在继续发展，但是发展不平衡，有些地区的干部已开始滋长自满松劲情绪，今冬兴修水利的规划、工程质量、劳动力的组织和其他生产工作的安排等问题也急待解决。为此，中共陕西省委在11月20日召开了关中四十个县、市委书记的电话会议。
    中共陕西省委负责人在会上指出，要使目前全省群众性的冬季兴修水利等生产运动广泛和深入的开展，除克服少数干部的自满松劲情绪，加强具体组织领导工作外，还必须使今冬兴修水利建设计划更加充实、完善。目前，有些地区只抓紧了新建水利工程，而对原有水利设施的修理和养护则注意不够；有的地区抓紧了条件较好地区的水利建设，而忽视了条件较为困难地区的水利建设和水土保持、保墒工作；有些地区重视灌溉工程，而轻视排涝工程；有的抓紧修渠打井，而放松了安装水车和准备冬灌工作。负责人说，各地除应该继续抓紧新建水利工程外，也要注意原有水利设施的利用率。对于水土保持、保墒、排涝等应视为同样是水利基本建设的重要内容。各地应逐乡、逐社将今冬的水利规划检查一下，根据各地不同情况，因地制宜加以妥善安排。
    省委负责人指出，兴修水利必须注意工程质量。提高工程质量的主要方法是多和群众商量，有些地方采用“土工程师”座谈会、请有经验的农民作顾问、组织参观等经验，应该继续推行，同时，还要检查验收制度，力争今冬的水利工程“修一项成一项”、“成一项用一项”。
    负责人说，目前兴修水利必须和冬灌紧密结合起来。今秋全省抗旱播种、地墒不饱，因此及时冬灌和春灌是争取明年丰收的重要关键。除应充分发挥原有各种水利工程的设备能力进行灌溉外，还要努力争取新修水利工程大部分赶上冬灌。各地要很好安排和组织劳力，尽量做到“渠成、地平、水到”，随修随灌，多灌一亩是一亩，不要忽视小宗的灌溉。
    负责人还提出必须克服只抓水利而忽视其他冬季生产的“单打一”的工作方法。
