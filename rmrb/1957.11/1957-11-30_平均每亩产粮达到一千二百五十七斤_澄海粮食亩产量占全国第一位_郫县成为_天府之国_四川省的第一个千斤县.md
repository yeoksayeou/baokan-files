    This newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th report: Chenghai County, Guangdong Province, has once again achieved a bumper harvest of late rice. This year, the average yield per mu of the county's more than 250,000 mu of grain crops reached 1,257 jin, surpassing Chao'an County's 1,233 jin per mu and taking the lead in the country's grain yield per unit area. Chenghai County has not only maintained the level of a "Thousand-Jin County" for three consecutive years, achieving the goal of stable yields in high-yield areas, but has also begun to break through the stable situation and continue to improve amidst stability. This year, the yield per mu increased by 24 jin compared to 1956, and by 248 jin compared to 1955, when it became a "Thousand-Jin County." This is a significant victory for Chenghai County on the grain front.
    By the end of the first Five-Year Plan this year, Chenghai County's grain yield per unit area has increased by 72.6% compared to 1952, and the total output has increased by 41.3%, transforming Chenghai from a county that lacked grain for four months each year into a self-sufficient county. "Spring drought, summer floods, autumn tides, and winter dryness" and "three harvests in ten years" were the portrayal of Chenghai's agricultural production during the Kuomintang rule. Fundamentally changing natural conditions and continuously vigorously developing water conservancy became the main key to Chenghai County's increased production and an important reason for the continued increase this year. In the seven years since liberation, especially during the first Five-Year Plan period, Chenghai County implemented the guidelines of "using more manpower and less financial resources, long-term preparation and short-term construction" and "people-run and government-assisted," vigorously consolidating and repairing coastal and river embankments and constructing various drainage and irrigation culverts and ditches. By the spring of this year, all water conservancy projects totaled more than 1.83 million cubic meters of earthwork, more than 160,000 cubic meters of stonework, and a total of 8.71 million workdays were spent. These water conservancy projects have formed an organized drainage and irrigation system throughout the county, with the irrigation area reaching 96.3% of the total cultivated land area.
    Good water conservancy conditions have enabled Chenghai County to change its farming system and farming techniques at a faster rate and increase the yield per unit area. In particular, after ensuring sufficient fresh water sources for the sandy fields, it has been able to implement methods of soil improvement and increased fertilization. Now, more than 86,000 mu out of the county's 105,000 mu of single-season sandy fields have been converted to double cropping, enabling the county's multiple cropping index of grain cultivated land to continuously increase, exploiting the potential of the land, and gradually realizing three harvests a year. This is also an important measure to enable the continued increase in high grain yields.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 28th report: Pixian County has now become the first "Thousand-Jin County" in Sichuan Province. After repeated calculations, the average yield per mu of grain in the county reached 1,028.9 jin, an increase of 7.92% compared to last year, reaching the highest target of grain production in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule. A large number of agricultural cooperatives with large-area, high-yield grain crops have emerged in the county, with 59.95% of the cooperatives averaging more than 1,000 jin of grain per mu.
    In addition to grain crops, the county also achieved bumper harvests of rapeseed, tobacco, and hemp. The number of pigs in the county has also increased from more than 70,000 last year to more than 80,000, with an average of 1.8 pigs per household.
    Pixian County is located in the Dujiangyan irrigation area of the western Sichuan Plain, with fertile land and a mild climate. It has achieved bumper harvests in the eight years since liberation, with yields steadily increasing year by year. At present, the production of agricultural cooperatives in the county has exceeded the level of local wealthy middle peasants.
    Pixian County's ability to become a "Thousand-Jin County" this year is mainly due to the fact that under the leadership of the Party and the government, the county's farmers have actively expanded the multiple cropping index by utilizing the superior conditions of cooperation. This year, the area of double-season rice in the county has increased elevenfold compared to last year, and measures such as increasing early spring planting, intercropping potatoes and corn, and increasing late autumn planting of mud beans have been implemented, increasing the multiple cropping index to 240%, with grain produced from multiple cropping accounting for 62% of the increased production.
    At present, the county's farmers have basically completed the sowing plan for small spring crops and are launching a production upsurge closely linked to the rectification movement, focusing on water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation and production, protecting cattle for the winter, and controlling rice borers, laying a good foundation for further production increases next year.

### 平均每亩产粮达到一千二百五十七斤  澄海粮食亩产量占全国第一位  郫县成为“天府之国”四川省的第一个千斤县

    平均每亩产粮达到一千二百五十七斤
    澄海粮食亩产量占全国第一位
    郫县成为“天府之国”四川省的第一个千斤县
    本报广州29日电　广东省澄海县今年晚稻又告丰收，全县二十五万多亩粮食作物，今年平均亩亩达到一千二百五十七斤，赶过了亩产量一千二百三十三斤的潮安县，跃居全国粮食单位面积产量的首位。澄海县不仅能连续三年保持千斤县的水平，达到了高产地区要求稳定产量的目的，而且已经开始突破稳定局面，在稳定中继续提高。今年每亩比1956年提高了二十四斤，比成为“千斤县”的1955年提高了二百四十八斤。这是澄海县在粮食战线上一个重大的胜利。
    到今年为止的第一个五年计划期间，澄海县粮食单位面积产量比1952年已增产了72．6％，总产量增加41．3％，使澄海由每年缺粮四个月变成粮食自足县。“春旱、夏涝、秋潮、冬涸”和“十年三收”，是澄海在国民党统治时期农业生产的写照。单是水田一项每年就有70％的面积（十万亩以上）经常受涝害。从根本上改变自然条件，不断地大力兴修水利，就成了澄海县取得增产的主要关键，也是今年继续增产的重要原因。解放七年来，特别是在第一个五年计划期间，澄海县贯彻了“多用人力，少用财力，长期准备、短期兴修”及“民办公助”等方针，大力巩固培修沿海沿江堤防和兴修各种排灌涵闸沟渠，到今年春天，全部水利工程共有土方一百八十三万多立公方，石方十六万多立公方，共付出八百七十一万个工作日。这些水利工程使全县形成一个有组织的排灌系统，灌溉面积达到耕地总面积的96．3％。
    良好的水利条件使澄海县能够以较快速度来改变耕作制度与耕作技术，提高单位面积产量，特别是保证沙田有充沛的淡水源以后，能够实行改良土壤和增施肥料的方法，现在全县十万五千多亩单造沙田已有八万六千多亩改为双造了，使全县粮食耕地的复种指数能够不断提高，发挥了土地潜力，逐步实现了一年三熟。这也是使粮食高额产量仍能继续提高的一项重要措施。
    新华社成都28日电　郫县今年已跃为四川省的第一个千斤县。经过反复核算，全县粮食每亩平均产量到达一千零二十八点九斤，比去年增产7．92％，提前达到了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的粮食产量最高指标。县内出现了大量的粮食作物大面积高额丰产的农业社，有59．95％的社平均每亩产粮食超过千斤。
    除了粮食作物以外，这个县的油菜、烟、麻等三种作物都获得了丰收。全县的猪也由去年的七万多头增加到八万多头，平均每户有猪一点八头。
    郫县位于川西平原都江堰流域，土地肥沃，气候温和。解放八年来连获丰收，产量逐年平稳上升。目前，全县农业社的生产已经超过了当地富裕中农的水平。
    郫县今年能跃为千斤县，主要是由于在党和政府的领导下，全县农民利用合作化的优越条件，积极扩大了复种指数。今年，全县双季稻的面积比去年增加十一倍，并推行早春增种、间种马铃薯和玉米，晚秋增种泥豆等措施，使复种指数增至240％，由复种而增产的粮食占增产量的62％。
    目前，这个县的农民已基本上完成小春作物播种计划，正在掀起紧密结合整风运动的以兴修水利、积肥造肥、保护耕牛过冬、治螟等工作为中心的生产高潮，为明年的进一步增产打下良好基础。
