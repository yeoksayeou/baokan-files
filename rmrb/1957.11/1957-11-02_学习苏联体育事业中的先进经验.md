Learning from the Advanced Experience of Soviet Sports
Rong Gaotang

The Soviet Union, the first socialist country in the world established according to Marxist-Leninist theory, has just celebrated its fortieth anniversary. It is now advancing towards communism at a magnificent pace.

Over the past forty years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have achieved tremendous accomplishments in all aspects of construction, including sports. Like other endeavors, Soviet sports have surpassed all capitalist countries and have firmly ascended to the highest level in the world. Sports in the Soviet Union have become extremely widespread among workers, farmers, and intellectuals, and the achievements of Soviet sports have reached the forefront globally.

The reason Soviet sports have achieved such brilliant success is that they are based on the latest achievements of modern science and are founded on Marxist-Leninist theory. Only under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist thought can we correctly analyze sports as a social phenomenon, scientifically determine its purpose, tasks, and role in socialist society, accurately summarize sports practices to enrich theoretical principles, further advance practice, and cultivate the morality and will of young people in the spirit of communism. In the Soviet Union, sports are based on advanced materialistic physiology, especially Pavlov's theories, as its natural scientific foundation. Because the object of sports practice is people, it is necessary to understand the physiological laws of the human body and the impact of various sports teaching and training processes on the human body, to achieve the goals of improving health, enhancing work efficiency, and improving sports skills. Sports are an integral part of communist education and an organized process of education through physical activity.

The path of development of Soviet sports is a model for our country's sports work. We must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in sports to better develop mass sports in our country. This direction is not to be wavered.

However, a small handful of right-wing elements here say that learning from the Soviet Union is dogmatism.

If we don't learn from the Soviet Union, who should we learn from? Are they suggesting learning from the United States? In old China, we learned from the United States for decades and didn't achieve anything. Isn't this something everyone knows! In the eight years since liberation, we have learned from the Soviet Union, which has fundamentally changed the face of Chinese sports.

The United States uses sports as a tool to deceive and anesthetize the people. They put forward the extremely hypocritical slogan that sports are unrelated to politics to deceive people. This is the ruling class using young people's love of sports to make them only play ball and not care about politics, turning them into people with developed limbs and simple minds, for the ruling class to arbitrarily use. They treat sports as a commodity and athletes as tools for making money. They also use sports as a tool to promote imperialist culture. In short, they are fundamentally not concerned with the people's health and moral education. Can we learn from such American sports?

After the national liberation, in order to improve the people's health and strengthen their physical fitness, better serve production and national defense, and build and defend our great motherland, the Party and the People's Government have attached great importance to the development of sports. However, at that time, we did not have a correct sports theory and system, only some scattered things with strong American influence. We decided to learn from the Soviet Union. This was the correct path. Because only by learning from the Soviet Union can our sports serve socialism and build a complete scientific system of socialist sports in our country.

Facts have fully proven that the rapid development of sports in our country in such a short period is the result of the leadership of the Party and the government, the care of the people, and the efforts of all sports workers and athletes. At the same time, it is also the result of learning from the Soviet Union.

Sports are a part of socialist culture, an important means of carrying out communist education among the people, and a scientific and effective method of improving people's health and strengthening their physical fitness. Therefore, we take developing mass sports and gradually popularizing and regularizing them as our sports work policy. In order to implement this policy, we learned the effective Soviet sports system and various specific measures suitable for us, and formulated our own sports system and work plan based on our country's actual conditions.

Radio calisthenics were learned from the Soviet Union. After the trial implementation in individual areas in 1951 proved effective, it was gradually promoted throughout the country and has become an indispensable activity in the daily lives of the broad masses of people today.

The Prepared for Labor and Defense (GTO) system is the foundation of the Soviet comprehensive sports system. It has become a standard for Soviet youth to conduct universal exercise. This system of assessing people's health also exists in some capitalist countries. However, based on the principle of all-round development, the Soviet Union requires people to possess several qualities of strength, endurance, speed, and agility, and has formulated a more complete scientific GTO system, giving it a clear exercise purpose, namely, preparing for labor and defending the country. Based on this Soviet system, in 1951, according to the physical conditions of young people and the development of sports at that time, we formulated simple and easy exercise standards in individual areas. In 1954, the GTO system was officially promulgated for key trial implementation, and based on the trial implementation, it was universally promoted throughout the country in 1956. The GTO system implemented in our country, from projects to standards, was developed by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and based on the specific conditions of our country. The projects are fewer than those of the Soviet Union, and the standards are lower. The results of the implementation have proven that this system has not only fundamentally changed the unplanned situation of sports in our country, but has also become an activity loved by the majority of young people. In 1956, more than 760,000 people in our country passed various levels of the GTO system, and in the first half of 1957, more than 530,000 people passed various levels of standards. Due to the widespread implementation of the GTO system, it has played a good role in enhancing the physical fitness of young people in our country and improving sports skills.

In order to encourage young people to engage in continuous exercise and continuously improve their sports technical level during exercise, we learned the Soviet athlete ranking system. It began to be implemented on a trial basis in 1956, and by the first half of 1957, there were 57,112 ranked athletes, including 114 Master of Sports.

Amateur sports schools for teenagers and children are an important measure we learned from the Soviet Union to popularize sports and improve sports technical level. These schools use the after-school time of middle school students and utilize various sports venues to give students classes two or three hours a week, teaching them technical knowledge and theory of various sports, and cultivating them to become excellent athletes. Young people who study in amateur sports schools can not only improve their skills, but also motivate other students in their schools to engage in physical exercise. At present, there are 105 such schools in the country, training more than 10,000 young athletes. Although they have only been studying in amateur sports schools for just one year, many of them are already ranked athletes.

We learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and established our competition system and ranked referee system. Since the ranked referee system was implemented on a trial basis in 1956, there have been 24,608 referees of various levels by the first half of this year.

In improving the level of sports technology in our country, Soviet comrades have given us inestimable help. Wu Chuanyu, an excellent swimmer in our country, is an athlete who studies diligently, trains hard, and has a strong will. In 1952, his 100-meter backstroke score was 1 minute 11.7 seconds. After training for nearly a year, the score only improved by one-tenth of a second. But when he passed through the Soviet Union to participate in the 4th World Youth Festival, after Soviet comrades gave him scientific guidance on his posture and movements, his score improved from 1 minute 11.6 seconds to 1 minute 6.4 seconds in just eight or nine days. Chen Jingkai's weightlifting also improved by dozens of kilograms in a very short time after being guided by Soviet coaches. Basketball is one of the most popular sports in our country. Before liberation, although our playing style had its advantages, the biggest shortcomings were the lack of comprehensive physical training, slow speed, and the impractical style of playing. At the end of 1950, the Soviet basketball team came to China to give us a very meaningful basketball lesson. The most prominent characteristics of the Soviet team were strong physical fitness, fast speed, good teamwork, and a simple playing style. The Soviet basketball team and our basketball team had detailed discussions on the relevant issues of basketball. Since then, the style of basketball in our country has undergone a fundamental change. China's competitive gymnastics has now been developed more extensively and has achieved better results, but before 1953, we did not understand the projects, rules, and movements of this sport. After the Soviet gymnastics team came to China to perform in 1953, the seeds of competitive gymnastics in our country were sown. At present, the level of various sports in our country has greatly improved, and some projects have even reached or approached the international level. This is the result of the sincere and selfless help and guidance of Soviet comrades, and it is the result of our learning from the Soviet Union. In training athletes and improving sports level, we have learned from Soviet comrades the comprehensive physical exercise, the teaching plans and teaching methods for athlete training, medical supervision, and other complete sets of scientific training methods.

In terms of organizational leadership, we have learned from the Soviet Union's mass amateur sports associations organized according to the masses' own will and hobbies. This is the best organizational form to promote mass sports by using the power of the masses themselves.

We have also referred to the Soviet sports teaching syllabus and, according to our country's situation, after several years of work practice, compiled our country's sports teaching syllabi for primary, secondary and high schools. Before this, physical education in our schools was just what the teachers knew and taught, and there was no plan. With the teaching syllabus, the training objectives and curriculum tasks were clarified. As for the compilation of teaching plans, teaching syllabi, and textbooks for our sports colleges, it was even more dependent on the direct help of Soviet experts. Otherwise, it would be difficult to establish our teaching work, improve the quality of teaching, and build a scientific system of socialist sports in a short period of time.

In order to train professional sports teachers and sports science talents, in recent years, under the guidance of Soviet experts, the Beijing and Shanghai Sports Colleges have respectively held special research classes in sports theory, track and field, exercise physiology, football, gymnastics, anatomy, swimming, hygiene, basketball, volleyball, and other specialties, training a considerable number of graduate students. They will become the vanguard of sports science research in our country. Soviet experts have also helped us hold training courses for instructors in football, basketball, volleyball, track and field, swimming, gymnastics, weightlifting, etc., training more than 1,200 coaches who have systematic knowledge of each of these sports in our country.

Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in sports is an important factor in the rapid development of sports in our country in a short period of time, especially in the past four or five years.

In order to promote the further development of sports in our country, we must learn from the Soviet Union more humbly, diligently, and unswervingly. In order to thank Soviet comrades for their selfless help, we must also work hard to further promote the development of sports in our country.

    学习苏联体育事业中的先进经验
    荣高棠
    按照马克思列宁主义理论在世界上建立起来的第一个社会主义国家——苏联，已经满四十周年了。它现在正以雄伟的步伐在共产主义建设的道路上迈进。
    四十年来，苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，在各种建设方面都获得了巨大的成就，在体育事业方面也同样获得辉煌成就。苏联的体育事业正像其他事业一样，已超过一切资本主义国家而稳固地攀登到世界最高的水平。苏联的体育运动已在全国工人、农民、知识分子中极为广泛地普遍开展起来，苏联体育运动的成绩已站到世界最先列。
    苏联体育运动之所以能获得这样辉煌的成就，是因为苏联的体育是建立在现代科学最新成果之上的，是以马克思列宁主义为理论基础的。只有在马克思列宁主义的思想指导下，才能正确地分析作为社会现象的体育，科学地确定它在社会主义社会中的目的、任务和作用；才能正确地总结体育的实践以丰富理论原则，再进一步推进实践；也才能以共产主义的精神培养青年的道德和意志。在苏联，体育是以先进的唯物主义的生理学，特别是巴甫洛夫学说，为其自然科学基础的。因为体育实践过程中的对象是人，所以必须了解人体内部的生理规律，以及各种体育教学和运动教练过程对人体的影响，达到增进身体健康、提高工作效能和运动技巧的目的。体育是共产主义教育不可分割的一部分，是通过身体活动进行教育的一个有组织的过程。
    苏联体育事业的发展道路是我国体育工作的榜样，我们要学习苏联在体育事业上的先进经验，更好地开展我国群众性体育运动。这个方向是不容动摇的。
    可是，在我们这里却有一小撮右派分子说，学习苏联是教条主义。
    不学苏联学谁呢？是说要学习美国。在旧中国，我们学了几十年美国，没有学出什么成绩来，这不是尽人皆知的事吗！解放后八年，我们学了苏联，才使得中国体育事业的面貌根本改观。
    美国把体育作为欺骗和麻醉人民的工具，它提出体育与政治无关这个极端虚伪的口号来骗人，这是统治阶级利用青年对体育运动的爱好，叫青年们只打球，不管政治，成为四肢发达、头脑简单的人，供统治阶级任意驱使。他们把体育运动当作商品，把运动员当作赚钱的工具。他们又把体育运动当作宣扬帝国主义文化的一种工具。总之，他们关心的根本不是人民健康和道德品质教育。我们能向这样的美国体育事业学习吗？
    全国解放后，为了改善人民健康状况和增强人民体质，更好地为生产和国防服务，建设和保卫我们伟大的祖国，党和人民政府对发展体育事业，给予了极大的重视。可是，我们当时并没有一套正确的体育理论和制度，只有一些有浓厚的美国影响的、零零散散的东西。我们决定向苏联学习。这是一条正确的路。因为只有学习苏联才能使我国体育事业为社会主义服务，才能建设我国社会主义体育运动的完整的科学体系。
    事实已经充分证明，我国体育运动所以能在这样短短几年中有了迅速的发展，这是党和政府的领导、全国人民的关怀、全体体育工作者和运动员努力的结果，同时，也是学习苏联的结果。
    体育是社会主义文化的一部分，是向人民进行共产主义教育的重要手段，是改善人民健康状况和增强人民体质的科学的有效的方法。因而我们把开展群众性的体育运动并使之逐步普及和经常化作为我们体育工作的方针。为了贯彻执行这一方针，我们学习了苏联行之有效又适合于我们的体育制度和各种具体措施，根据我国的实际情况制定我们自己的体育制度和工作计划。
    广播体操是从苏联学来的。从1951年在个别地区试行，有了成效之后，就逐步在全国推行，今天已经成为广大人民日常生活中不可少的一项活动了。
    劳卫制是苏联综合体育制度的基础，它已成为苏联青年普遍进行锻炼的标准，这种鉴定人们健康状况的制度，在一些资本主义国家也有。但是苏联根据全面发展的原则，要求人们具备力量、耐力、速度、灵敏几种素质，制定了更为完整的科学的劳卫制，并给它以明确的锻炼目的，即准备劳动与卫国。我们根据苏联这一制度，在1951年按照我国当时青年身体条件和运动开展情况，在个别地区制定了简单易行的锻炼标准。到1954年正式公布重点试行劳卫制，根据试行情况在1956年才在全国普遍推行。我国所推行的劳卫制，从项目到标准，都是学了苏联的先进经验并根据我国具体情况制定的。项目比苏联的少，标准比苏联的低。推行结果证明，这一制度不仅根本改变了我国体育无计划的情况，而且已成为广大青年所喜爱的一项活动了。1956年我国通过各级劳卫制的有七十六万多人，1957年上半年又有五十三万多人通过各级标准。由于劳卫制的普遍推行，对于我国青年体质的增强，运动技术的提高，都起了良好的作用。
    为了鼓舞青年进行不间断的锻炼，并在锻炼中不断提高运动技术水平，我们学习了苏联的运动员等级制度，从1956年开始试行，到1957年上半年，已有五万七千一百一十二名有等级的运动员，其中运动健将一百一十四人。
    青、少年业余体育学校是我们从苏联学来的普及体育运动、提高运动技术水平的一项重要措施。这种学校是运用中学生课余时间，利用各体育场地，每周给学生们上课二、三小时，教他们各项运动的技术知识和理论，培养他们成为优秀的运动员。在业余体育学校学习的青年不但可以提高技术，还可在他们读书的学校里带动其他同学进行体育锻炼。目前，全国已有一百零五所这样的学校，培养着一万多名青、少年运动员。他们在业余体育学校里虽然学习了刚刚一年，但是他们中间已有不少等级运动员了。
    我们从苏联的先进经验中学习并建立了我们的竞赛制度和等级裁判员制度。等级裁判员制度自1956年试行起到今年上半年止，已经有二万四千六百零八名各级裁判员。
    在提高我国运动技术水平上，苏联同志给了我们难以估计的帮助。我国优秀游泳运动员吴传玉是一个勤学苦练、具有坚强意志的运动员，他在1952年，百公尺仰泳成绩是1分11秒7，锻炼了将近一年，成绩只提高了十分之一秒。但当参加第四届世界青年联欢节路过苏联的时候，由于苏联同志对他的姿势、动作给以科学的指导后，只经过八、九天的工夫，他的成绩就由1分11秒6提高到1分6秒4。陈镜开的举重也是经过苏联教练指导后，在很短时间内就提高了几十公斤的。篮球运动是我国最普及的一项运动。在解放前，我们的打法虽有其优点，但最大缺点是缺乏体力的全面训练、速度慢、打法上的华而不实的作风。1950年底，苏联篮球队到中国来给我们上了一次极有意义的篮球课。苏联队最突出的特点是体力强、速度快，全队合作好，打法朴实。苏联篮球队和我国篮球队详细座谈了篮球运动的有关问题。从此，我国篮球运动的作风才有了根本的改变。中国的竞技体操运动现在已有了较广泛的开展和较好的成绩，但是在1953年以前，我们还不懂这项运动的项目、规则和动作呢。1953年苏联体操队到中国来表演后，才播下了我国竞技体操运动的种子。目前我国各项运动水平都有了很大的提高，有的项目甚至已经达到或接近了国际水平。这是苏联同志真诚无私的帮助和指导的结果，是我们学习苏联的结果。在训练运动员、提高运动水平上，我们向苏联同志学习了身体全面锻炼，运动员训练的教学计划和教学法，医务监督等等整套的科学训练方法。
  在组织领导上，我们学习了苏联按照群众自愿和爱好组织起来的群众性的业余体育协会。这是一种运用群众自己的力量来推动群众体育运动的一种最好的组织形式。
    我们还参照苏联的体育教学大纲，按照我国情况，经过几年的工作实践，编出了我国的大、中、小学的体育教学大纲。在这以前，我国学校体育只是教师会什么教什么，是没有什么计划的。有了教学大纲，才明确了培养目标和课程任务。至于我国体育学院的教学计划、教学大纲和教材的编写，更是靠了苏联专家的直接帮助。否则，要在短期内建立我们的教学工作，提高教学质量和建设社会主义体育的科学体系是困难的。
    为了培养体育专业师资和体育科学人材，几年来在苏联专家的指导下，在北京和上海体育学院，分别举办了体育理论、田径、运动生理、足球、体操、解剖、游泳、卫生、篮球、排球等各专业研究班，培养了相当数量的研究生。他们将成为我国体育科学研究的先头部队。苏联专家还帮助我们举办了足球、篮球、排球、田径、游泳、体操、举重等项指导员训练班，为我国培养了一千二百多名对于各该项运动有系统知识的教练员。
    学习苏联在体育事业上的先进经验，这是我国体育事业能在短短几年中，特别是近四、五年内，获得迅速发展的重要因素。
    为了推动我国体育事业更向前进一步，我们必须更加虚心地努力地坚定不移地向苏联学习。为了感谢苏联同志给我们的无私的帮助，我们也必须努力地工作，把我国体育事业更向前推进一步。
