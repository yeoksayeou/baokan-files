    The United States Fails in the Rocket Race
    Shi Chao Li
    American imperialism has always been arrogant, self-important, and dismissive of everything else, especially in science and technology. After World War II, American imperialists vigorously developed rockets and missiles, consuming a great deal of manpower and spending countless amounts of the American people's blood and sweat. From 1950 to 1957 alone, financial expenditures in this area exceeded six billion U.S. dollars. In the view of that small group of rulers in the United States, they were firmly in first place in the development of rockets and missiles. Therefore, on the one hand, they widely publicized their plan to develop artificial Earth satellites—the so-called "Vanguard" program—which they believed they were fully capable of launching first; on the other hand, they regarded the statement made by Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in June of this year that the Soviet Union might launch an artificial satellite within a few months as a kind of "extra-scientific motive" and "political boasting."
    Facts are the most ruthless. As a result, they slapped themselves in the face. It was the Soviet Union that successfully launched an artificial Earth satellite. Conversely, the United States has suffered a series of failures in this regard.
    The United States has been testing its ballistic intermediate-range and intercontinental missiles. But the results have not been good. The United States' trump card missile—the Atlas ballistic intercontinental missile—exploded midway through a test in June of this year. Another test was conducted in September, and the result was the same. To this day, there is no further news on this test. The testing of intermediate-range ballistic missiles has also suffered repeated failures, either due to rocket engine explosions or control mechanism failures. Washington reported in mid-October that, under pressure from various criticisms, the U.S. government had to admit that it had conducted four rocket test launches recently, none of which were successful. According to a report on October 19, when a U.S. intermediate-range ballistic missile (possibly a "Jupiter" type) was given the launch signal during a test launch, the mechanism failed, and it remained safely on the launch pad without moving. Following this failure, the United States had to postpone the test of the "Vanguard" rocket, which was intended to carry the satellite.
      The "Vanguard" rocket has also undergone several tests, and the results have all been unfavorable. In late October, a "Vanguard" rocket was launched, but only the first stage was present; the remaining two stages were missing. Of the two rockets launched on a Pacific island, the "launch result of one was unclear." In order to counteract the enormous impact of the Soviet satellite, the U.S. Air Force announced that it would launch a rocket even higher than the Soviet satellite, and they predicted that the rocket would fly to an altitude of 1,600 to 6,400 kilometers. But this launch plan has been postponed again. The reason given was "unfavorable weather." The four tests conducted in the Pacific were intended to carry the rocket to high altitude by balloon before launching it, but the results were again failures due to "unfavorable weather." It was said to be "because the temperature at high altitude was too low, affecting the balloon and preventing it from carrying the rocket to the proper position."
    All of this can only illustrate one thing: the paper tiger of American science and technology has been completely exposed. The United States can no longer use it as a weapon to intimidate and deceive other countries, especially economically backward countries.

    美国在火箭竞赛中失败了
    史超礼
    美帝国主义一向是狂妄自大、目空一切的，特别是在科学技术方面。第二次世界大战之后，美帝国主义者大力发展火箭和导弹，耗费了大量的人力，花了无数的美国人民的血汗，单单从1950年到1957年度用在这方面的财政开支，就有六十亿美元以上。照美国的那一小撮统治者看来，在火箭和导弹的发展方面，他们是稳居世界第一的。因此，他们一方面广事宣传发展人造地球卫星的计划——所谓“先锋”计划，他们认为完全有把握，可以先发射人造卫星；另一方面他们把今年6月间苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫宣布几个月内苏联可能发射出人造卫星的话认为是一种“超科学动机”和“政治上的吹牛”。
    事实是最无情的。结果他们用自己的手打了自己的嘴巴。获得成功发射人造地球卫星的是苏联，相反地，美国却在这方面遭受到一连串的失败。
    美国的弹道式中程导弹和洲际导弹一直在进行试验。结果却不见佳妙。美国导弹中的王牌——阿特拉斯弹道式洲际导弹今年6月里试验一次，中途爆炸了。9月又进行了一次试验，结果还是原样，直到现在，这个试验还没有下文。中程弹道式导弹的试验也是迭遭失败，不是火箭发动机爆炸，就是控制机构失灵。华盛顿10月中旬消息，美国政府在多方责难之下不得不承认，最近它进行了四次火箭的试射工作，没有一次获得成功。据10月19日的消息，美国一个中程弹道式导弹（可能是“木星”式）在试射时，对它发出起飞信号，结果是机件失灵，它仍安然站在起飞台上不动。在这次失败以后，美国不得不把预备运送卫星的“先锋”式火箭的试验推迟。
      “先锋”式火箭也进行过好几次试验了，结果都不好。十月下旬试射出了一只“先锋”式火箭，但只有第一级，其余二级都没有；在太平洋岛上发射的两支火箭中，有一支是“发射结果不明”。为了抵消苏联卫星的巨大影响，美国空军宣布要发射一支比苏联卫星还要高的火箭，他们并预料火箭将会飞到一千六百到六千四百公里的高空。但这个发射计划又推迟了。原因是“气候不佳”。在太平洋上进行的四次试验是预备把火箭用气球带到高空后再发射，而结果又是“气候不佳”都失败了。据说是“因为高空温度太低，气球受到影响，没有把火箭带到应有的位置”。
    这一切只能说明一件事：美国科学技术上的纸老虎已经完全折穿。美国再也不能拿它当作武器，向其他国家，特别是经济落后的国家进行恫吓、诈骗了。
