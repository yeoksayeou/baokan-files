Xinhua News Agency, 17th: In response to the criticisms and suggestions regarding the leadership style of the Ministry and Bureau raised by the masses during the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, the Party Group of the Second Ministry of Machine Building has formulated four measures for improvement:

    First, establish a system for ministers, directors, and bureau chiefs to regularly participate in business meetings at the next lower level. The implementation of this system, where ministers, directors, and bureau chiefs attend meetings at lower levels to understand the situation and become familiar with cadres, will help overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism in leadership work, reduce the time spent on layer-by-layer reporting, and solve problems in a timely manner.

    Second, establish a system for leading cadres to regularly receive the masses. The specific method is that ministers, directors, and bureau chiefs will receive visiting members of the public on specified days each week, directly assisting the masses in solving their difficulties, and listening to their criticisms and suggestions.

    Third, stipulate that leading cadres at all levels personally engage in specific work. Important reports to be submitted to higher authorities and important telegrams to be issued must be drafted by the leaders themselves; major issues in the work must be handled by the leaders themselves; and reports sent from below must be personally read and approved by the leaders, and they must personally synthesize the situation to study problems. Implementing this regulation can change the style of pushing responsibility and procrastination, thereby greatly improving work quality and efficiency.

    Fourth, stipulate that leading cadres at all levels must adhere to the system of participating in physical labor. Since the Central Government issued the decision on leading cadres participating in physical labor, the leading cadres of the Ministry, Departments, and Bureaus have regularly participated in physical labor in nearby agricultural production cooperatives and factories. However, some units have not persisted enough. Now, in addition to organizing work in nearby agricultural production cooperatives or the factories and construction sites of the Ministry, some directors and bureau chiefs are also carrying coal and cleaning public places in the offices.

During the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, the entire staff of the Second Ministry of Machine Building has already put forward more than 41,800 opinions. The leadership of the Ministry is currently sorting out and studying these opinions by category, and is immediately changing what can be changed.

    决心改进部局的领导作风
    二机部规定四项具体办法
    部长、司长和局长定期参加下一级业务会议；部长、司长和局长每周定期接见群众；领导干部亲自动手做具体工作；各级领导干部坚持参加体力劳动。
    新华社17日讯中共第二机械工业部党组针对群众在大鸣大放中对部、局领导作风提出的批评和建议，定出了四项改进的办法。
    第一，建立部长、司长和局长定期参加下一级业务会议的制度。实行这一制度，部长、司长和局长到下边参加会议，了解情况，熟悉干部，将有助于克服领导工作中的官僚主义和主观主义，减少层层汇报的时间，及时解决问题。
    第二，建立领导干部定期接见群众的制度。具体办法是部长、司长和局长每周分别在规定的日子接见群众来访，直接地帮助群众解决困难问题，倾听群众的批评和建议。
    第三，规定各级领导干部亲自动手做具体工作。写给上级的重要报告和拟发的重要电报，必须由领导人亲自起草；工作中的主要问题，必须由领导人亲自负责处理；下面送来的报告，领导人必须亲自阅批，并亲自综合情况研究问题。实行这个规定，可以改变层层推脱和拖拉的作风，从而大大地提高工作质量和工作效率。
    第四，规定各级领导干部必须坚持参加体力劳动的制度。这个部自中央发布领导干部参加体力劳动的决定以来，部、司、局领导干部定期地分别在附近的农业生产合作社和工厂参加体力劳动。但也有些单位坚持不够。现在，除了组织到附近农业生产合作社或下本部的工厂和建筑工地外，有的司、局长还在机关抬煤和打扫公共场所。
    第二机械工业部全体工作人员在大鸣大放中已经提出四万一千八百多条意见。部的领导方面对这些意见正在分门别类地进行整理和研究工作，对于能够改的都马上就改。
