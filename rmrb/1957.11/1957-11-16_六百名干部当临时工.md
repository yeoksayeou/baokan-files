Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Telegram Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has organized six hundred cadres to participate as temporary workers in the major repair work of the large-scale steelmaking workshop, which began on the 13th. They are working alongside workshop workers to dismantle open-hearth furnaces and carry bricks. This is a new approach taken by Chongqing Iron and Steel Company to organize cadres to participate in physical labor.

Those participating in this planned labor include the company's Party Secretary, the heads of the Party Committee's various departments, the company's manager, department heads, section chiefs, and other staff members, including many female employees. These individuals have a high level of enthusiasm for labor, and their work efficiency is even higher than that of the temporary workers hired in the past.

The company has many temporary repair tasks. The steelmaking workshop alone requires a medium or major repair on average once a month, each time requiring the temporary hiring of six or seven hundred or even more than a thousand workers, which is not only troublesome to manage and increases expenses, but sometimes the inability to hire people also affects production.

The company organizes cadres to participate in physical labor in a way that they work for half a day and labor for half a day, which does not affect their work.

    六百名干部当临时工
    据新华社重庆电　重庆钢铁公司六百名干部作为临时工人参加了13日开始的大型炼钢车间的中修工作，他们同车间工人一起拆卸平炉，搬运砖头。这是重庆钢铁公司组织在职干部参加体力劳动所采取的一种新方式。
    参加这一次有计划劳动的，有这个公司的党委书记、党委会各部部长、公司经理、处长、科长以及其他工作人员，其中有不少女职员。这些人劳动热情很高，工作效率比过去雇用的临时工还要高。
    这个公司临时性的检修任务很多，单是炼钢车间平均每个月就要中修或大修一次，每次要临时雇用六、七百个甚至一千多个工人，不仅管理麻烦，增加开支，有时雇不到人还要影响生产。
    这个公司组织干部参加体力劳动采取半天工作半天劳动的方式，并不影响工作。
