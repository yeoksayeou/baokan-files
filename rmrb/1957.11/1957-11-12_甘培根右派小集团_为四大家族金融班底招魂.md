    The Gan Peigen Rightist Clique
    Reanimating the Financial Clique of the Four Big Families
    (Reported by this newspaper) Recently, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the People's Bank of China smashed a rightist clique headed by Gan Peigen.
    The backbone members of this clique, Gui Qizhang (member of the China Democratic National Construction Association), Xu Jingbo, Chen Xiangming, and Hu Mingli, under the leadership of Gan Peigen (member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), viciously slandered the achievements of our country's foreign exchange work, saying "Indigenous foreign exchange is a complete mess, getting worse every day," and proposed so-called "the virtuous in position, the foolish learn, the experts return to the team," attempting to hold up Lin Fengbao, the former director of the business bureau of the puppet Central Bank, as a banner, implement a general registration of foreign exchange "talent," and reanimate the financial clique of the Four Big Families.
    This rightist clique also convened symposiums in the name of democratic party organs, wantonly attacking the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, saying "The movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries in the Foreign Exchange Administration was a complete mess, seriously hurting the self-esteem of intellectuals," and advocated the establishment of a "rehabilitation" group with the participation of non-party members and those targeted in the suppression.
    This handful of rightists also tried their best to smear the Party's cadre policy and sow discord between the Party and the masses. They compared the masses to Xianglin Sao and the Communist Party to Master Lu Si, and slandered Party members, saying: "In the past, a woman's lack of talent was a virtue, but now a Party member's lack of talent is a virtue." They believed that putting old cadres and Communist Party members in leadership positions was "not enough to accomplish anything, but more than enough to spoil things."
    After the masses' reasoning and struggle, this rightist clique has completely collapsed. In the face of a large number of facts, the rightists have all bowed their heads and confessed their crimes.

    甘培根右派小集团
    为四大家族金融班底招魂
    本报讯　中国人民银行总行国外业务管理局最近粉碎了以甘培根为首的右派小集团。
    这个小集团的骨干分子归淇章（民建会员）、徐静波、陈详明、胡明理等在甘培根（民革成员）的领导下，恶毒地污蔑我国外汇工作所取得的成绩，说
  “土外汇，一团糟，一天不如一天”，提出所谓“贤者在位，愚者学习，内行归队”，企图捧出曾任伪中央银行业务局局长的林风苞为旗帜，实行外汇“人才”总登记，为四大家族的金融班底招魂。
    这个右派小集团还以民主党派机关组织的名义召开座谈会，大肆攻击肃反运动，说“国外局肃反运动搞得一团糟，严重伤害了知识分子的自尊心”，主张成立“平反”小组，由党外人士和肃反对象参加。
    这一小撮右派分子还竭力污蔑党的干部政策，挑拨党群关系。他们把群众比作祥林嫂，把共产党比作鲁四爷，并且诽谤党员说：“从前，女子无才便是德，现在党员无才便是德”。他们认为老干部和共产党员放在领导岗位上是“成事不足，败事有余”。
    这个右派小集团，经过群众的说理斗争后，已经彻底垮台。右派分子在大量的事实面前，纷纷低头认罪。
