Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 22nd: November 20th marked the 39th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Communist Party. A commemorative meeting was held in Budapest on this day.

    Kish, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, said at the commemorative meeting that the establishment of the Hungarian Communist Party was not only a turning point in the history of the Hungarian workers' movement, but also a turning point in the history of the entire Hungarian nation. Since its establishment, our party has maintained close cooperation with the Bolshevik Party and Lenin, and we are proud of this.

    Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party, members of the Central Committee, and veteran Communist Party members attended the commemorative meeting. Regarding the Party's mass policy, Kish said that attention must be paid to avoiding the influence of revisionism, and we must firmly stand on principled positions. We must not forget that revisionism now poses a rather serious danger to us. We must concentrate our efforts on opposing revisionism, and at the same time, constantly oppose sectarianism and dogmatism. We must strive to ensure that cadres handle their work in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, and we must not allow phenomena that weaken the relationship between the Party and the masses to exist.

    Local newspapers published editorials and articles on this day to commemorate the Party's birthday.
