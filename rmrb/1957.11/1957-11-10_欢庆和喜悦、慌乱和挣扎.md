    The World Celebrates the Great Festival of Humanity
    In these days, the whole world is immersed in the joy of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.
    The October Socialist Revolution was the greatest revolution in human history. The victory of the October Revolution resulted in the establishment of a Soviet regime without exploitation and national oppression on one-sixth of the world's land, heralding a new era in human history and enabling mankind to step from the decadent old capitalist world into the new socialist world.
    In the past forty years, the world has undergone tremendous changes. First, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have transformed a formerly very backward Russia into the world's leading powerful socialist industrial country in just forty years. Secondly, the strength of the socialist camp has grown, the forces of imperialism have weakened, and the colonial system has disintegrated. Thirdly, communist ideology has become increasingly popular, and the international workers' movement has become increasingly magnificent. These tremendous changes fully demonstrate the incomparable superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, and demonstrate that Marxism-Leninism has achieved a great victory. All progressive people in the world cheer for the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union over the past 40 years and the great victories of socialism worldwide, and cheer for the achievements of the great October Socialist Revolution!
    During the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, Moscow was crowded with delegations from twelve fraternal countries that had achieved socialist revolution along the path of the October Revolution, representatives of fraternal communist and workers' parties from sixty-one countries, representatives of many progressive people's organizations from around the world, and envoys from the working people of the world. They gathered in Moscow to participate in the celebration大会盛大阅兵式和群众游行的观礼and congratulate the Soviet Party, government, and people. This unprecedented grand celebration, with representatives of all progressive human beings gathering together, is in fact a great review of the cause of human progress and the strength of the international proletariat. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "This fact itself shows the great unity of the people of the world and symbolizes the prosperity of the international socialist movement."
    During the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Chinese people launched unprecedented celebrations and also formed a Chinese delegation headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and a laboring people's delegation composed of representatives from all walks of life to go Moscow to participate in the celebrations. Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Unin celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution that the great achievements of the Soviet Union in the past forty years are not only the pride of the Soviet people, but also the pride of the world proletariat, and the pride of all mankind. Chairman Mao also pointed out that the Soviet road, the road of the October Revolution, is fundamentally the common bright road for the development of all mankind. He also said: Strengthening the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is the sacred international obligation of all socialist countries.
    The great October Revolution took place forty years ago. The changes in world history in the past forty years prove that the decadent old capitalist world will inevitably give way to the emerging and growing new socialist world. Taking the Soviet road, taking the road of the October Revolution, and taking the road of socialism and communism is the inevitable course of history. Let us hold high the banner of the October Revolution and forge ahead bravely!
    The New Soviet Moon Shakes the World Again
    While progressive people all over the world were warmly welcoming the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, one victory after another in new scientific and technological achievements came from the Soviet Union. On November 3, less than a month after the launch of the first artificial satellite, the Soviet Union successfully launched the second artificial satellite. It not only greatly exceeded the first artificial satellite in weight and altitude, carrying more scientific instruments, but also contained a live animal—a dog—for testing. By November 8, the second artificial satellite had circled the Earth sixty-eight times at an altitude of about 1,500 kilometers. Observations have proved that its operation is completely normal, and the work of the internal instruments and the dog's physiological condition are also good.
    The launch of the second Soviet artificial satellite is the most brilliant gift presented by the Soviet working people and outstanding Soviet scientists to the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. It shook the world again. The people of socialist countries and all progressive mankind hailed this great achievement of the Soviet Union and regarded it as a product of the great victory of the socialist system and as a common achievement of the entire socialist camp. With the launch of one artificial satellite after another, the prestige of the Soviet Union and the prestige of socialism has greatly increased throughout the world. In various countries around the world, even those who do not understand or even have no goodwill towards socialism cannot help but be captivated by this most amazing achievement in modern history created by socialist Soviet Union.
    The launch of the second Soviet artificial satellite not only further opened the road to the universe, but also will make invaluable contributions to mankind in science. At the same time, it also has a huge and profound impact on the development of the entire international situation and international relations. It has greatly strengthened the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the confidence of the people of all countries in maintaining world peace, and has dealt a fatal blow to the policy of strength of American imperialism. When the new Soviet moon was running rapidly at a speed of eight kilometers per second amidst the cheers of people all over the world, the American ruling group was panicking and in a state of chaos. Agence France-Presse reported from Washington that the successful launch of the second Soviet artificial satellite has "created a sense of national disappointment" in the United States; US Senator O'Mahoney complained that the United States' backwardness in this regard has "sacrificed [America's] position of leadership in the world." President Eisenhower, who was "greatly stimulated," hurriedly convened the largest National Security Council meeting in American history on November 7 to discuss the "development of the situation" caused by the Soviet artificial satellite. Many American congressmen have even requested a special congressional meeting to discuss "why the United States is behind the Soviet Union," and some have requested that a "chief" or "Minister of Science" be specially established in the American government to directly lead matters related to missiles and artificial satellites. Throughout the Western world, the prestige of the United States has been severely weakened. A reporter from Agence France-Presse stationed in the United States said: "There is little doubt that the Soviets are the masters in a field where Americans have long considered themselves invincible." The British "Manchester Guardian" believes that the launch of the second Soviet artificial satellite not only "greatly shaken the confidence of the United States, and it obviously made the United States worry whether its friends will continue to trust it in its position as the leader of the Western alliance." In Asia, Hoberecht, president of the United Press International's Asian headquarters, admitted that the rise of the second Soviet artificial satellite means another decline in the status of the United States. The Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" stated in an editorial that Japan should consider a neutralist path.
    In short, due to the successive launches of Soviet artificial satellites, the socialist system has won a victory of great significance in the competition with the capitalist system. It has not only definitely lost its advantage in science and technology, but has also fundamentally affected the strategic position and military plans of the United States.
          The Struggle of the United States
    However, the panicked American ruling group is still unwilling to give up its policy of "strength" and its ambition to dominate the world. It is struggling, trying to save its precarious situation. Some figures in the American ruling group are shouting loudly and ringing the alarm, trying to use this to incite fanatical emotions that will intensify the "cold war" atmosphere, so as to step up the implementation of its military blocs and arms expansion policies. In this regard, the British Conservative government is also playing a role in fueling the flames.
    The Washington talks held by the heads of government of the United States and Britain at the end of last month were talks aimed at strengthening the arms expansion policy. The result of this meeting was to accelerate the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction under the guise of so-called "scientific cooperation" and further provoke the nuclear arms race. To this end, the Washington talks also decided to hold a top-level meeting of the North Atlantic Group in mid-December. US President Eisenhower and the heads of government of other countries in the group have announced that they will attend the meeting.
    American officials and its propaganda machine have continuously revealed the United States' approach to the top-level meeting of the North Atlantic Group. According to the information revealed, the United States first seeks to reassure the people of the North Atlantic Group countries, wanting them to believe in the "strength" policy of the United States; at the same time, it also wants to urge other countries to continue to increase military expenditures and expand their armaments. It is reported that the United States will establish a missile base network in Western Europe, establish an atomic weapons stockpile for the North Atlantic Group, and organize a central collective force of the North Atlantic Group that uses atomic weapons. It can be seen that, in addition to reassuring people and strengthening the implementation of the arms expansion policy, the United States also wants to further control other countries in the North Atlantic Group to serve its war policy. At the same time, West German militarist forces are also eager to try, wanting to obtain the right to manufacture missiles and atomic weapons at this meeting. However, no matter how the United States struggles, under the current situation, it is obviously becoming more and more difficult to continue to implement the bankrupt "strength position" policy.
    In contrast, the Soviet Union is working to ease the international situation and strive for peaceful coexistence. In his report celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, once again proposed the proposal for socialist countries and capitalist countries to hold high-level talks. This proposal is fully in line with the wishes of the people of all countries. The governments of Western countries such as the United States and Britain are trying to dilute the impact of this proposal, which shows that they are afraid of this peace proposal. The people of all countries will draw their own conclusions from these facts: it is now time to stop the American ruling group and its partners from continuing the Cold War, continuing the arms race, and creating the danger of a new destructive war.

    欢庆和喜悦、慌乱和挣扎
    顾思
    普天同庆人类伟大节日
    在这些日子里，全世界都浸沉在庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的欢乐里。
    十月社会主义革命，是人类历史上最伟大的一次革命。十月革命胜利的结果，在世界六分之一的土地上建立了没有剥削和民族压迫的苏维埃政权，宣告了人类历史的新纪元，使人类开始从腐朽的资本主义旧世界，走进社会主义新世界。
    四十年来，世界已经发生了巨大的变化。首先，苏联人民在共产党的领导下，在短短的四十年期间，已经把一个原来十分落后的俄国，建设成为世界上头等强大的社会主义工业国家。其次，社会主义阵营的力量日益强大，帝国主义势力日益衰弱，殖民体系日益解体。再次，共产主义思想越来越深入人心，国际工人运动日益波澜壮阔。这些巨大的变化，充分地显示了社会主义制度比资本主义制度具有无可比拟的优越性，显示了马克思列宁主义已取得了伟大的胜利。全世界进步人类都为苏联四十年的光辉成就和社会主义在世界范围内取得巨大胜利而欢呼，为伟大的十月社会主义革命的成果而欢呼！
    在庆祝十月革命四十周年典礼的日子里，莫斯科云集了十二个沿着十月革命道路取得社会主义革命胜利的兄弟国家的代表团、六十一个国家的兄弟共产党和工人党的代表、世界许多进步人民团体的代表和全世界劳动人民的使者。他们聚集到莫斯科参加庆祝大会和盛大阅兵式和群众游行的观礼，并向苏联党、政府和人民祝贺。这个规模空前的盛大庆祝活动，和全体进步人类的代表聚集一堂，实际上是人类进步事业和国际无产阶级力量的大检阅，正像毛泽东同志所说的：“这个事实本身就说明了世界人民力量的伟大团结，就象征了国际社会主义运动的兴旺发达。”
    在庆祝十月革命四十周年的日子里，中国人民展开了规模空前的庆祝活动，还组成了以毛泽东同志为首的中国代表团和各界代表人物组成的劳动人民代表团前往莫斯科参加庆祝典礼。毛主席在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命四十周年大会上的讲话中指出，苏联四十年的伟大成就，不但是苏联人民的骄傲，而且是全世界无产阶级的骄傲，而且是全人类的骄傲。毛主席并且指出，苏联的道路，十月革命的道路，从根本上说来，是全人类发展的共同光明大道。又说：增强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结，是一切社会主义国家的神圣的国际义务。
    伟大的十月革命已经发生四十年了，四十年来世界历史的变化证明：腐朽的资本主义旧世界，必然要让位于新兴的、日益壮大的社会主义新世界。走苏联的道路，走十月革命的道路，走社会主义和共产主义的道路，是历史的必然。让我们高举十月革命的旗帜奋勇前进吧！
    苏联新月亮又一次震动世界
    在全世界进步人类热烈迎接伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，从苏联一个又一个地传来了科学技术新成就的胜利捷报。11月3日，距离第一颗人造卫星的发射还不到一个月，苏联又接着成功地发射了第二颗人造卫星。它不但在重量上和高度上大大地超出了第一颗人造卫星，载有更多的科学仪器，而且还装有一只用作试验的活体动物——狗。到11月8日为止，第二颗人造卫星已在一千五百公里左右的高空，绕地球运行了六十八圈。观察结果证明，它的运行情况完全正常，内部仪器的工作和狗的生理情况也都良好。
    苏联第二颗人造卫星的发射，是苏联劳动人民和杰出的苏联科学界献给十月革命四十周年的最辉煌的礼物。它又一次震动了全世界。社会主义阵营各国人民和全体进步人类都欢呼苏联这一伟大的成就，并把它看成是社会主义制度伟大胜利的产物，看成是整个社会主义阵营的共同成就。由于一颗又一颗的人造卫星的发射，苏联的威望，社会主义的威望，在全世 界大大地增长了。在世界各国，那些对社会主义并不了解甚至并无好感的人们，现在也不能不为社会主义苏联所创造的这一现代历史上最惊人的成就而倾心折服了。
    苏联第二颗人造卫星的发射，不但进一步打开了通向宇宙的道路，而且在科学上将会对人类作出无可估价的贡献。同时，它对整个国际局势和国际关系的发展，也有着巨大的深刻的影响。它大大地加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量和各国人民维护世界和平事业的信心，并且给美帝国主义的实力政策以致命的打击。当苏联的新月亮在全世界人民的欢呼声中以每秒八公里的速度迅速运行的时候，美国统治集团正在惊惶失措，慌作一团。法新社从华盛顿发出的电讯说，苏联第二个人造卫星的发射成功，已在美国“造成了一种民族的失望感”；美国参议员奥马洪尼埋怨美国在这方面的落后状态已“牺牲了（美国）领导世界的地位”。“受到了很大刺激”的艾森豪威尔总统，在11月7日赶紧召开了美国历史上最大一次的国家安全委员会会议，讨论由于苏联人造卫星所引起的“事态的发展”。许多美国议员更要求召开国会特别会议来讨论“美国为什么落在苏联后面”，有的人则要求在美国政府中专设一个“总管”或“科学部长”，来直接领导有关导弹和人造卫星的事务。在整个西方世界，美国的威望已受到了严重的削弱。法新社驻美记者说：“人们已很少怀疑，在美国人长期来认为自己是无敌的领域中，苏联人是主宰者。”英国“曼彻斯特卫报”则认为，苏联第二颗人造卫星的发射，不但“大大动摇了美国的自信心，并且显然使美国担心它的朋友们是否会对于它所担任的西方联盟领导者的地位继续给予信任。”在亚洲，合众社亚洲总分社社长霍布雷奇特承认，苏联第二颗人造卫星的升起，意味着美国的地位的又一次下降。日本“朝日新闻”则在社论中表示，日本应当考虑一种中立主义的路线。
    总而言之，由于苏联人造卫星的接连发射，社会主义体系在同资本主义体系的竞赛中，已经赢得了具有伟大意义的胜利。它不但使美国在科学技术上肯定地丧失了优势，而且也在根本上牵动了美国的战略地位和军事计划。
          美国的挣扎
    但是，慌做一团的美国统治集团，仍不甘心放弃它的“实力”政策和统治世界的野心，它正在进行挣扎，企图挽救它的岌岌可危的处境。美国统治集团的某些人物正在大嚷大叫，乱敲警钟，企图借此煽起使“冷战”气氛趋于紧张的狂热情绪，以便加紧推行它的军事集团和扩军备战政策。在这方面，英国的保守党政府也起着推波助澜的作用。
    上个月下旬由美英两国政府首脑举行的华盛顿会谈，就是企图加强扩军备战政策的会谈。这个会谈的结果就是要在所谓“科学合作”的幌子下，加紧制造大规模杀人的武器，并进一步挑起核子军备竞赛。为此目的，华盛顿会谈并决定在12月中旬举行一次北大西洋集团的最高级会议。美国总统艾森豪威尔以及这个集团其他国家的政府首脑已宣布将参加这个会议。
    美国官方人士和它的宣传机器已不断透露美国在北大西洋集团最高级会议的做法。根据透露出来的消息，美国首先是安定北大西洋集团国家的人心，要它们相信美国的“实力”政策；同时它还要督促其他国家继续增加军费，扩充军备。据报道，美国将在西欧设立一个导弹基地网，建立一个北大西洋集团的原子武器储备库，组织一支使用原子武器的北大西洋集团中央集体部队。可见，美国除了要安定人心和加强推行扩军备战政策之外，还要进一步控制北大西洋集团其他国家，来为它的战争政策服务。与此同时，西德军国主义势力也跃跃欲试，想在这个会议上取得制造导弹和原子武器的权利。但是，不管美国如何挣扎，在目前的形势下，要继续推行已经破产的“实力地位”政策，困难显然是愈来愈大愈来愈多了。
    与此相反，苏联却为缓和国际局势和争取和平共处而努力。苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫在庆祝十月革命节四十周年的报告中，再一次提出社会主义国家同资本主义国家举行高级会谈的建议。这个建议是完全符合各国人民的愿望的。美英等西方国家政府企图冲淡这个建议的影响，这说明它们是害怕这个和平建议的。各国人民将从这些事实中得出自己的结论：制止美国统治集团及其伙伴们继续进行冷战，继续进行军备竞赛和制造新的毁灭性战争的危险，现在已经是时候了。
