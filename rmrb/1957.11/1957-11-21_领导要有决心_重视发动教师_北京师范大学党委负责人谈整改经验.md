Xinhua News Agency, 19th: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Yunhui reports:) Beijing Normal University, in the past forty-odd days, has, through fully mobilizing the masses, formed a vigorous mass-based rectification movement. To understand the current progress of the movement in this school and the experience gained, the reporter interviewed the responsible person of the Chinese Communist Party Beijing Normal University Committee.

**More than 95% of People Have Offered Opinions, Sharply Aimed at Five Aspects Including Party Committee Leadership**

Reporter asked: What are the main issues raised by the masses? How have these issues been handled?

Responsible person replied: In the past forty-odd days, more than 95% of the teachers, students, and staff throughout the school have put forward more than 42,000 criticisms and suggestions regarding various aspects of the school's work. In summary, in addition to demanding the handling of rightists and strengthening labor education, the masses mainly focused on problems and opinions regarding five aspects: improving Party committee leadership, improving teaching work, overcoming extravagance and waste, consolidating organizational structures, and strengthening labor discipline. They criticized the school Party committee for not paying close enough attention to ideological and teaching leadership, exposed a large number of facts about extravagance and waste, and criticized the phenomena of bloated and inefficient organizations and lax labor discipline. Under the approach of unified leadership, tiered responsibility, and everyone participating, the school has now handled more than 80% of the more than 36,000 opinions that should be handled by the school. Problems that could be resolved promptly have been basically resolved. Some of the work that has already been improved, such as leaders at all levels going deep into the masses and deep into teaching, has also been codified into systems to be implemented in the future. Several issues that remain to be resolved either have proposed solutions or are being submitted to the masses for discussion.

**Mobilizing the Masses to Form a Climax; Utilizing the Climax to Improve Work**

Q: How was this mass rectification movement initiated?

A: We believe the key lies in whether the leadership has determination. The primary manifestation of this determination is to boldly mobilize the masses, consistently follow the mass line, and vigorously improve work. On this issue, we went through three rounds of ideological struggle.

After achieving victory in the anti-rightist struggle, should we first concentrate our efforts on rectification or carry out rectification concurrently with other tasks? This was the first round. In the initial days after the mobilization report, we wanted to both concentrate on rectification and simultaneously conduct socialist debates among the masses, without expressing a firm determination to rectify within the masses. As a result, the masses offered few opinions, and the ideological understanding of the cadres was not clear. Some departments shelved the opinions raised by the masses in the early stages of rectification. At this time, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on the need to vigorously improve work after achieving victory in the anti-rightist struggle. We resolutely implemented these instructions, immediately concentrated all our efforts on rectification, seriously addressed a batch of opinions raised by the masses in the early stages of rectification, and published them on big-character posters. The various departments of the school then conducted a series of mobilization efforts among the masses. These measures triggered a strong reaction among the masses. From October 16th to 20th, within five days, the masses put forward more than 20,000 opinions. The second round of great airing of views quickly entered a climax.

When the airing of views entered a climax, some people underestimated the enthusiasm of the masses, and some believed that "the movement is almost over," leading to a sense of relaxation. This began the second round. The school Party committee criticized these two views, pointing out that although the airing of views by the masses had entered a climax, development was uneven across departments, and it was necessary to continue mobilizing the masses to push the climax to its peak. After the units continued to mobilize the masses, they put forward tens of thousands of opinions in five days.

On October 25th, the Party committee, considering that the movement had reached its peak, decided to shift the focus of rectification to streamlining the organization. However, the next day, when inspecting the situation of improving work, it was found that some departments had solved very few problems, and some departments had not solved the problems deeply enough because they had not mobilized the masses for discussion. After repeated consideration, the Party committee resolutely changed its original plan and decided to "strike while the iron is hot" and spend another two weeks concentrating all efforts on improving work, so that other problems could be solved more smoothly in the future. Because we achieved "unified leadership, tiered responsibility, leaders at all levels taking personal action, and the broad masses actively participating," this formed a climax of improving work. This was the third round. As a result, in the climax of improving work, everyone took action, and the changes were made quickly and well. The Chinese Department has now handled more than half of the 1,800-plus opinions in these two weeks. Some problems that are usually difficult to solve, such as adjusting teachers' workloads, were also solved smoothly during this period. This made us deeply realize that mobilizing the masses to form a climax and utilizing the climax to improve work is the best thing to do.

**Conduct Persuasive Mobilization Based on the Characteristics of Teachers; The Focus of Rectification is on Improving Teaching Work**

Q: What are some of the characteristics of the school's rectification?

A: The majority of the opinions raised by the whole school this time are concentrated on teaching. Therefore, the main content of rectification is to improve teaching work and improve teaching quality. But to do this, we must pay attention to mobilizing the work of teachers.

We have several experiences in mobilizing teachers, that is: pay attention to the characteristics of teachers, strengthen teachers' sense of responsibility for improving teaching work, and believe in the majority of the masses.

We mobilized teachers, students, and staff together. Later, we found that some teachers were not used to expressing their opinions with big-character posters, and some teachers had a negative attitude towards students criticizing themselves on big-character posters. In view of this situation, the Party committee and the general party branches of each department held a series of teacher seminars to mobilize teachers to fully express their opinions, to show them the school's leadership's determination to improve work, and to encourage them to humbly consider the opinions of the students. After such mobilization and explanation, the teachers' enthusiasm for airing their views generally increased. In the two old professors' seminars held by the Party committee alone, teachers put forward hundreds of opinions. Teachers in the Biology Department not only actively aired their views, but also spontaneously organized themselves to clear and sort out tens of thousands of instruments and specimens that had not been cleaned for many years, using Sundays and spare time for three weeks.

When the movement shifted to focusing on improving work, the Party committee ordered the general party branches of each department to submit the opinions raised by the masses on teaching to the department's administrative leadership and to let teachers fully discuss them. For opinions on individual teachers, the teachers themselves would propose solutions; for opinions on the whole department or teaching and research group, all teachers of the whole department or teaching and research group would discuss and propose solutions. These methods and opinions, after being studied by the general branch and approved by the department's administrative leadership, were publicized among the masses. This strengthened teachers' sense of responsibility for improving teaching work, so they were very active and serious when discussing and implementing opinions on improving work.

When discussing how to improve teaching work, if some teachers could not accept some issues that needed to be improved and could be improved, they were still handed over to the teachers themselves for discussion. Because we believe that after the masses are generally mobilized, the vast majority of teachers can actively participate in rectification. In fact, such problems are generally solved after full discussion by the teachers. Moreover, because there were ideological exchanges in repeated discussions, the problems were solved more thoroughly and deeply. For example, the Chinese Department proposed to carefully fill out teaching calendars to ensure the planning and quality of teaching. At first, some teachers disagreed, and other teachers suggested that carefully filling out teaching calendars was one of the important measures to overcome bourgeois liberalism in teaching. Later, after full discussion, everyone reached a consensus in understanding. In a few days, teachers throughout the department generally began to fill out more detailed teaching calendars. This had not happened in the past few years.

Because the teachers have been mobilized, most of the opinions on teaching in each department have been dealt with, which not only solved most of the problems raised by the masses in the rectification stage, but also laid the foundation for the school to further improve teaching work and improve teaching quality in the future.

**From Specific to Major Problems, Improving Layer by Layer; Failure to Pay Attention to Specific Problems Will Affect the Airing of Views, Ignoring Major Problems Will Make Rectification Shallow and Incomplete.**

Q: What is the trend of the movement's development?

A: At the beginning of the movement, the opinions raised by the masses were mostly obvious and common problems in daily life, such as saving water and electricity, improving food management, and requesting adjustment of the opening hours and medical treatment times of the reading room and clinic. We believe that although these problems seem to be small problems, since they are of concern to the broad masses, they are important problems. Therefore, we have seriously dealt with them one by one. Some problems were raised in the morning and solved in the afternoon. As a result, the masses responded very well. They said: From the handling of these problems, we see the leadership's determination to improve work. Thus, they gradually raised some major problems existing in the school's work. From the leadership's point of view, on the one hand, it is to continuously mobilize the masses by solving these specific problems; on the other hand, it is precisely because these specific problems have been solved that we have gradually grasped some of the main aspects of the school's problems, so that we can grasp the key points and summarize the more than 40,000 opinions into the above-mentioned aspects, so that all cadres can have clear ideas and gradually solve problems in a planned and step-by-step manner. From this, we realized that in rectification, whether it is airing views or improving work, it is from small to large, from easy to difficult, from general and specific problems to major central problems. If the leadership does not pay attention to and handle the general and specific problems raised by the masses at the beginning of the movement, it will affect the enthusiasm of the masses to express their opinions; if they are only satisfied with discovering and solving these general problems, and do not further mobilize the masses to air their views and gradually solve some of the major problems in their work, it will make the rectification shallow and incomplete.

**Rectification Work Has Only Achieved Preliminary Victory**
**There is Still Much Arduous and Detailed Work to Be Done**

Q: How does the school Party committee estimate the achievements of the current rectification?

A: In this rectification, some problems have been solved, some problems have only been proposed solutions, and some problems still need to be reported to higher levels for solutions or need to be debated on specific topics among the masses. Therefore, from the overall situation, the school's current rectification has only achieved preliminary results, and there is still much arduous and detailed work to be done in the future. Among them, even for the problems that have been solved in the rectification movement, it should be reviewed again whether the solutions are thorough and feasible. For some problems that have been proposed solutions, in the future, these solutions must be put into practice, and after implementation, they must be adhered to, all of which require a series of work and ideological struggles. If the leadership does not have enough estimates for the more arduous work in rectification in the future and the determination to do this work well, it is difficult to say that rectification can achieve complete victory.

Therefore, the school Party committee will work with all teachers, students, and staff on the basis of the achievements that have been made to make unremitting efforts to achieve the complete victory of rectification.

    领导要有决心　重视发动教师
    北京师范大学党委负责人谈整改经验
    新华社19日讯　新华社记者李蕴辉报道：北京师范大学在过去四十多天中，经过充分发动群众，形成了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的整改运动。为了了解这个学校目前运动进展的情况和取得的经验，记者特访问了中共北京师范大学委员会的负责人。
    95％以上的人都提了意见锋芒针对党委领导等五个方面
    记者问：群众提出哪些主要问题？这些问题的处理情况如何？
    负责人答：在过去四十多天中，全校95％以上的师生员工对学校各方面的工作提出了四万二千多条批评和建议。归纳起来说，群众除要求对右派分子进行处理和加强劳动教育外，主要是对改进党委领导、改进教学工作、克服铺张浪费、整顿组织机构和加强劳动纪律等五个方面的问题和意见。他们批评了学校党委对学校的思想领导和教学领导抓得不紧，揭露了大量铺张浪费的事实，批评了机构臃肿不灵、劳动纪律松弛的现象。在统一领导、层层负责、大家动手的做法下，现在学校已经处理了应由学校处理的三万六千多条意见中的80％以上。凡可以及时解决的问题基本上全已得到解决。有些已经改进了的工作如各级领导干部深入群众、深入教学等，并且订成制度，以便今后贯彻执行。若干尚待解决的问题，有的已经提出了处理方案，有的正在提交群众讨论中。
    发动群众形成高潮  利用高潮改进工作
    问：这次群众性整改运动是怎样发动起来的？
    答：我们认为关键在于领导上是否有决心，这个决心的首要表现在于放手发动群众，自始至终地走群众路线和狠狠地改进工作。在这个问题上，我们曾经经过了三个回合的思想斗争。
    在取得了反右派斗争的胜利以后，是首先集中力量进行整改，还是把整改和其他任务同时并行？这是第一个回合。在动员报告后的最初几天内，我们既想集中力量搞整改，又想在群众中同时进行社会主义辩论，没有在群众中表示坚决整改的决心。因此，群众提的意见很少，干部的思想认识也不明确，有的部门把群众在整风初期提出的意见搁置起来了。这时，中共北京市委发出了关于在取得反右派斗争的胜利以后必须狠狠地改进工作的指示。我们坚决执行了这个指示，立即集中全力进行整改，认真处理了一批群众在整风初期所提出的意见，并且在大字报上公布出来。学校各部门接着又分别在群众中进行了一系列的动员工作。这些措施在群众中引起了强烈的反响，从10月16日到20日的五天内，群众就提出了两万多条意见。第二次的大鸣大放迅速进入高潮。
    当鸣放进入高潮后，有的人对群众的积极性估计不足，有的人认为“运动已经差不多了”，产生了松劲思想。这就开始了第二个回合。学校党委对这两种看法作了批判，指出群众的鸣放虽然已经进入高潮，但是各部门发展不平衡，必须继续发动群众，把高潮引向顶点。各单位继续发动群众后，五天的时间内，群众又提出了上万条意见。
    10月25日，党委鉴于运动已经进入高潮顶峰，决定把整改的重点转入紧缩机构。但是第二天在检查改进工作的情形时，发现有些部门解决的问题还很少，有些部门因为没有发动群众讨论，问题解决得不深不透。党委经过反复考虑，坚决地改变了原来的打算，决定“趁热打铁”，再用两周时间集中全力改进工作，以便将来能更顺利地解决其他问题。由于做到“统一领导、层层负责、各级领导亲自动手、广大群众积极参加”，这就形成了一个改进工作的高潮。这是第三个回合。结果，在改进工作的高潮中，大家动手，改得既快又好。中文系现在处理的一千八百多条意见中，有一半以上是这两周内处理的。平常很难解决的一些问题，如调整教师工作量等问题，在这个时期也顺利地得到了解决。这使我们深深感到：发动群众形成高潮，利用高潮改进工作，是最好不过的事。
    根据教师特点进行说服动员整改重点在于改进教学工作
    问：学校整改有些什么特点？
    答：这次全校提的意见中，多数集中在教学方面。因此整改的主要内容在于改进教学工作、提高教学质量。但是要做到这一点，必须重视发动教师的工作。
    我们在发动教师中有几点体会，这就是：注意教师的特点、加强教师对改进教学工作的责任感、相信群众的多数。
    我们对师生员工是一起发动的，后来发现有些教师不习惯用大字报提意见，有的教师对学生在大字报上批评了自己，有抵触情绪。根据这种情况，党委和各系党总支就召开了一系列的教师座谈会，发动教师充分提意见，向他们表明学校领导上对改进工作的决心，鼓励他们虚心地考虑学生们的意见。经过这样动员和交代后，教师们鸣放的热情普遍提高，仅在党委召开的两次老教授座谈会上，教师们就提出了上百条意见。生物系教师不仅积极鸣放，还自动组织起来，在三个星期内，利用星期天和课余时间，清查和整理了多年没有清理的上万件仪器和标本。
    运动转入以改进工作为重点时，党委又责成各系党总支把群众提出的有关教学方面的意见，提交系行政领导上，放手发动教师充分讨论。属于对个别教师的意见，由教师个人提出解决办法；属于全系或教研组的意见，由全系或教研组全体教师讨论后提出处理意见。这些办法和意见经过总支研究和系行政领导上批准后，在群众中加以公布。这样就加强了教师对改进教学工作的责任感，因此他们在讨论和执行改进工作的意见时，都很积极认真。
    各系在讨论改进教学工作时，对于一些必需改进而又可以改进的问题，如果有的教师还不能接受，仍旧交给教师们自己讨论。因为我们相信在群众普遍发动起来以后，绝大多数教师都能积极参加整改。事实上，这类问题经过教师们充分讨论后，一般的也都能得到解决。而且因为在反复讨论中有了思想交锋，问题还解决得较透较深。如中文系提出要认真填写教学日历，以保证教学计划性和教学质量。开始有的教师不同意，另外有的教师提出认真填写教学日历是在教学中克服资产阶级自由主义的重要措施之一。后来经过充分讨论，大家在认识上取得一致，不几天，全系教师普遍开始填写较详细的教学日历。这是过去几年来所没有过的事。
    由于教师们发动起来了，目前各系有关教学方面的意见，基本上都得到处理，这不仅解决了群众在整改阶段提出的多数问题，而且为学校今后进一步改进教学工作、提高教学质量打下了基础。
    由具体到主要问题层层改进，不注意具体问题就会影响鸣放，忽视主要问题整改就不深不透。
    问：运动发展的趋势是怎样的？
    答：运动开始时，群众提出的意见，大多数是日常生活中一些显而易见、带普遍性的问题，如节约水电浪费、改进伙食管理、要求调整阅览室、医务所开放和看病时间等。我们认为，这些问题虽然看起来是小问题，但既然是广大群众关心的，就是重要问题。所以我们都一一认真地作了处理，有的问题上午提出来，下午就解决了。结果群众反映很好。他们说：从这些问题的处理中，我们看到领导上对改进工作的决心。从而他们逐步提出学校工作中存在着的一些主要问题。从领导角度来说，一方面是通过解决这些具体的问题，不断地发动群众，一方面也正因为解决了这些具体问题，逐步掌握了学校问题的一些主要面，才能提纲挈领地把四万多条意见归纳为上述的几个方面，使得全体干部思想明确，有计划、有步骤地逐步深入解决问题。从此，我们体会到：在整改中，不论是鸣放或改进工作，都是由小到大，由易及难，由一般性的具体问题到重大的中心问题。如果领导上不重视和处理群众在运动开始时提出的一般性的具体问题，就会影响群众提意见的积极性；如果只满足于发现和解决这些一般性的问题，不进一步发动群众鸣放和逐步解决工作中一些主要的问题，就会使整改不深不透。
    整改工作仅仅获得初步胜利
    还有许多艰巨细致工作要做
    问：学校党委对当前整改的成绩怎样估计？
    答：在这次整改中，有些问题是解决了，有些问题仅只提出了解决方案，有些问题还需要请示上级解决或需要在群众中展开专题大辩论。因此，从整个情况看，学校当前的整改还仅仅是获得了初步成绩，今后还有许多艰巨细致的工作要做。其中，仅以在整改运动中已经解决了的问题来说，也还应该复查一遍解决得是否彻底，是否切实可行。对于有些提出了解决方案的问题，今后要把这些方案付诸实行，实行以后要坚持下去，都需要经过一系列的工作和思想斗争。如果领导上对整改方面今后更艰巨的工作没有足够的估计和做好这些工作的决心，很难说能使整改获得全胜。
  因此，学校党委将和全校师生员工在目前已经取得成绩的基础上，为获得整改的全胜作坚持不懈的努力。
