    Gold Nibs, Steel Nibs, and Iridium Nibs
    In recent years, the market has not only offered gold nibs and steel nibs but also a large number of iridium nibs, which people are not familiar with. What are the differences between gold nibs, steel nibs, and iridium nibs? Which pen is the most durable and cost-effective? This is a question that every consumer is extremely concerned about and eager to understand.
    Gold Nib: The nib is generally made of an alloy of one-half gold, one-quarter silver, and one-quarter red copper (some are also made of 14K—58.6% gold). A small piece of hard, rare metal—iridium—is soldered onto the tip of the nib, which gives it a unique smoothness, softness, and fluency when writing. However, because it uses a lot of gold, the cost is higher, and the selling price is also higher.
    Steel Nib: The nib is made of stainless steel, and no iridium is soldered onto the tip, so the selling price is much lower than that of a gold nib. However, the nib is rough and easily worn.
    Iridium Nib: This falls between gold nibs and steel nibs. The nib itself is stainless steel (which is much more economical than using gold), but iridium is also soldered onto the tip. Except that the softness is slightly inferior to that of a gold nib (softness is not the main requirement of quality), its main usage values, such as smoothness, fineness, and wear resistance, are not inferior to those of a gold nib. And the selling price is only one-third of that of a general gold nib. (Fang Zixing)

    金笔、钢笔和铱金笔
    近两年来，市场上不仅有金笔、钢笔，还大量涌现了人们所不熟悉的铱金笔。金笔、钢笔和铱金笔各有哪些不同？到底采用哪种笔最为经用合算？这是每个消费者极所关心和渴望了解的问题。
    金笔：笔尖一般是用二分之一黄金、四分之一白银和四分之一紫铜熔化成的合金制成的（也有14K—58．6％金制成的）。笔尖头上焊有一颗体积不大性质坚硬的稀有金属—铱金，书写起来便产生它特具的光滑、柔和和流利。但是由于它采用了不少黄金，成本高一些，售价较高。
    钢笔：　笔尖是用不锈钢制的，笔尖头上也不焊铱金，故售价较金笔低廉得多。但是笔尖粗糙、且易磨损。
    铱金笔：介于金笔和钢笔之间，笔尖本身是不锈钢（要比采用黄金节约得多），但在尖头上同样焊有铱金。除柔和程度略逊于金笔外（柔和并不是质量的主要要求），其主要使用价值如光滑、细致和经磨等方面，并不亚于金笔。而售价只及一般金笔的三分之一。　（方孜行）
