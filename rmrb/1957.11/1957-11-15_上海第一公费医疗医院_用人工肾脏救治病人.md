Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Dispatch Shanghai's First Publicly Funded Hospital used an artificial kidney on the 10th to save a uremic patient who was already in a coma. This was the first time the hospital had treated a patient with its own designed artificial kidney after fourteen animal experiments.

The treatment was very successful. The artificial kidney replaced the patient's kidney in excreting toxins for four hours and twenty minutes, equivalent to washing the patient's entire body of blood ten times, removing 24% of the blood's toxins - urea nitrogen. After the treatment, the patient had emerged from the coma, and their heart, breathing, and blood were all normal. Doctors are preparing to puncture the vesicles inside the kidney again to solve the main problem of their developing uremia.

This artificial kidney is equipped with sixty layers of membranes that can permeate toxins from the blood, and is a total of ten centimeters high and seventeen centimeters wide. When the patient's blood passes through the machine, dialysate for cleaning the toxins flows through the interlayer at the same time. It not only cleans urea nitrogen from the blood, but also supplements the nutrients needed for the patient's physiology.

    上海第一公费医疗医院
    用人工肾脏救治病人
    新华社上海电  上海市第一公费医疗医院10日用人工肾脏救治了一个已经昏迷的尿中毒病人。这是医院用自己设计的人工肾脏作了十四次动物实验以后，第一次为病人治疗。
    这次治疗很成功。人工肾脏代替病人肾脏排泄毒物四小时二十分钟，相当于把病人全身的血液清洗十次，洗去了血液中的毒物——尿素氮24％。病人经过治疗后，已经脱离昏迷状态，心脏、呼吸、血液都正常。医生准备再为他穿刺肾脏内部的囊泡，解决他发生尿中毒的主要问题。
    这架人工肾脏装有六十层可以渗透血液中毒物的薄膜，共有十公分高、十七公分阔。病人的血液通过机械的时候，清洗毒物的渗析液在间层中同时流过，它既清洗了血液中的尿素氮，又能补给病人生理需要的养料。
