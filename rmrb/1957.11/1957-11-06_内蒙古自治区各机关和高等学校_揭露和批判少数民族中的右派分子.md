This newspaper dispatch from Hohhot on the 5th reports: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is progressively and thoroughly criticizing local nationalism and counterattacking rightist elements on national issues. This is a socialist education movement of great significance, being further developed on the basis of the victorious anti-rightist struggle in the previous stage throughout the region. The Party leadership in the Autonomous Region believes that criticizing local nationalism and counterattacking rightist elements on national issues is an essential socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts for implementing national policies, consolidating national unity, consolidating revolutionary achievements, and ensuring the smooth socialist construction of the Autonomous Region.

The people of all nationalities in the Autonomous Region warmly support and actively participate in this movement. As early as during the period of great contending and blooming in May and June of this year, rightist elements on national issues launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. Among these rightist elements, some were Han rightist elements who, standing on the position of Han chauvinism, carried out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. These have already been resolutely counterattacked in the previous stage of the anti-rightist struggle. There were also rightist elements (including Mongolians and other minority nationalities within the region) who, standing on the position of local nationalism, carried out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. These minority nationality rightist elements, under the guise of "loving their nationality," stirred up national discord, incited nationalistic sentiments among some national cadres, created an atmosphere of mistrust between nationalities, undermined unity between and within nationalities, and sabotaged the unity of the socialist motherland's big family, advocating drawing a national boundary between the Mongolian and Han nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and carrying out activities to separate from the motherland. In terms of socialist construction, they opposed the establishment of economic centers, the opening of fodder bases, and the immigration for land reclamation in pastoral areas, and opposed the construction of the Baotou industrial base, insisting that these things were "detrimental to Mongolians." They opposed democratic reform and socialist transformation, saying that this would "change the national characteristics." In terms of culture and education, they stubbornly closed their eyes and said that "the language and writing of the Mongolian nationality have regressed since liberation, and Mongolians are going to be assimilated." In general, they negated the great achievements of the Autonomous Region over the past ten years, fabricated shortcomings, magnified mistakes, and viciously attacked the Party and vilified the Party's leadership. In the final analysis, they wanted to oppose socialism, oppose the Party's leadership, and undermine the unity and solidarity of all nationalities, wholeheartedly dragging Inner Mongolia back to the historical old road full of suffering. After careful study and full preparation, the leadership, on the basis of the in-depth development of the anti-rightist struggle, began in early September to launch a reasoning struggle against some extremely reactionary national rightist elements, first in the organs and universities of the Autonomous Region, in conjunction with the study of national policies and the criticism of local nationalism. After nearly two months of struggle, the ugly faces and various fallacies of some national rightist elements have been thoroughly exposed and criticized. They were rendered speechless and completely isolated among the masses, and finally bowed their heads in confession before the people. Some are still resisting stubbornly, and the masses are continuing to struggle.

The movement to counterattack national rightist elements in Inner Mongolia over the past two months shows that the process of struggling against national rightist elements is also a process of raising the proletarian class consciousness and political understanding of the vast number of national cadres and masses. Through the struggle to counterattack national rightists, the national rightists have been isolated among the masses; at the same time, the vast number of national cadres have a deeper understanding of the harmfulness of nationalistic ideas.

    内蒙古自治区各机关和高等学校
    揭露和批判少数民族中的右派分子
    本报呼和浩特5日电　内蒙古自治区正在逐步深入彻底地批判地方民族主义和反击民族问题方面的右派分子。这是在全区前一阶段胜利进行反右派斗争的基础上，进一步深入开展的、具有重大意义的社会主义教育运动。自治区党的领导上认为，批判地方民族主义和反击民族问题方面的右派分子，是在自治区贯彻民族政策、巩固民族团结、巩固革命成果和保证自治区顺利进行社会主义建设的一场必经的政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命。
    自治区的各族人民热烈拥护和积极参加这一运动。早在今年5、6月大鸣大放期间，民族问题方面的右派分子向党和社会主义发动了猖狂的进攻。这些右派分子中，有的是站在大民族主义立场上，进行反党、反社会主义的汉族右派分子。这在前一阶段的反右派斗争中，已经进行了坚决的反击。还有的是站在地方民族主义的立场上，进行反党、反社会主义的右派分子（包括蒙族和区内其他少数民族的）。这些少数民族右派分子，以“热爱民族”作幌子，挑拨民族关系，煽动一些民族干部中的民族主义情绪，制造民族间的不信任的空气，破坏民族之间和民族内部的团结，破坏社会主义祖国大家庭的统一，主张在内蒙古自治区的蒙汉民族之间，划出一条民族疆界，进行与祖国分离的活动。在社会主义建设方面，他们反对在牧区建立经济中心、开辟饲料基地和移民开荒，反对包头工业基地的建设，硬说这些事“对蒙古人不利”。他们反对民主改革和社会主义改造，说这样就把“民族特点改掉了”。在文化教育方面，他们硬闭着眼睛说“解放以后蒙古民族的语言文字倒退了，蒙古人要被同化”。在总的方面，他们否定自治区十年来的伟大成就，捏造缺点，扩大错误，恶毒地攻击党和丑化党的领导。归根结底，他们是要反对社会主义，反对党的领导，破坏各民族的统一和团结，一心一意要把内蒙古拖回到苦难重重的历史老路上去。对这方面的民族右派分子，领导上经过慎重研究和充分准备，在反右派斗争深入开展的基础上，从9月初开始，首先在自治区的各机关和高等院校中，结合民族政策的学习和对地方民族主义的批判，对一些极为反动的民族右派分子展开了说理斗争。经过将近两个月的斗争，有些民族右派分子的丑恶面貌和各种谬论，已遭到彻底的揭露和批判。他们理屈词穷，已在群众中完全孤立，终于在人民面前低头认罪。有的仍在顽抗，群众正在继续进行斗争。
    内蒙古两个月来反击民族右派分子的运动表明：同民族右派分子进行斗争的过程，同时也是广大民族干部和群众提高无产阶级的阶级觉悟和政治认识的过程。经过反击民族右派的斗争，民族右派分子在群众中孤立了；同时，广大民族干部对民族主义思想的危害性也有了较深刻的认识。
