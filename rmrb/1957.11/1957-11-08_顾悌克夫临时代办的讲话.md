Dear Comrades and Friends!
    Today we are here to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. Please allow me to extend my heartfelt welcome to the guests who have come to attend our banquet in celebration of this joyous festival.
    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution led by the Communist Party headed by Lenin by the workers and peasants of Russia, marked the beginning of a new era – the era of the establishment of socialism.
    The historical significance of the October Revolution lies in the fact that it not only proclaimed, but also realized the great ideals of socialism, peace, equality, and friendship among all nationalities. In an unprecedentedly short historical period, our country has transformed from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country. The economic and cultural development of the Soviet people has been historically unparalleled.
    Our country's industrial production in 1957 increased thirty-two times compared with 1913. The system of collective farms has been irrevocably established in the countryside. In recent years, the Party and the government have implemented extremely great measures for the soaring progress of the entire agriculture. The formerly culturally backward Russia has become a country with advanced culture and science. The launching of two artificial earth satellites is a remarkable victory for the Soviet Union in science and technology.
    During the forty years of the existence of the Soviet regime, our motherland has been subjected to severe tests more than once. There have been many attempts, including armed ones, to strangle the world's first socialist country, but each time the socialist system showed the world its great vitality, the unbreakable unity of the Communist Party and the Soviet people.
    The ideas of the great October Revolution, the friendship and peace between all peoples, the ideas of national and social liberation, both in the past and now, have had a tremendous impact on the development of the entire world history. These ideas have been newly confirmed and developed in the great achievements of the socialist camp countries, in the victories of the national liberation movements in Asia and Africa, and in the unprecedented growth and strengthening of all forces that oppose war and advocate peaceful coexistence among countries with different political and social systems.
    Among the events in world history after the October Revolution, the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, which opened the road to socialism for 600 million people, is undoubtedly the most remarkable. The historically significant achievements made by the great Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong make all Soviet people feel heartfelt joy.
    The Soviet people sincerely wish the great Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party new achievements in the cause of building socialism.
    We, the Soviet people, are very pleased to see that the Chinese people are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution so warmly. Today, the festive brilliance of Beijing and the enthusiasm shown by the Chinese working people these days are another vivid example of the unbreakable unity and complete agreement of views between the Soviet and Chinese people, the two comrades-in-arms – builders of socialism and communism. The great friendship and unbreakable alliance between the people of our two countries is a reliable guarantee for further achievements in the construction of socialism and communism in our two countries, and a strong pillar of peace and international security.
    I propose a toast:
    To the glorious 40th anniversary of the great October Revolution,
    To the further development and consolidation of the friendship between the fraternal people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China,
    To the great Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party,
    To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!

    顾悌克夫临时代办的讲话亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    今天我们来庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。请允许我对为庆祝这个欢乐的节日前来出席我们的宴会的来宾们表示衷心的欢迎。
    俄国的工人和农民在以列宁为首的共产党的领导下所进行的伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，标志出一个新的时代——社会主义确立的时代的开始。
    十月革命的历史意义在于它不仅宣告，而且实现了社会主义，和平、平等和各族人民的友谊的伟大理想。我们的国家在空前未有的短短的历史时期里从一个落后的农业国变成了一个强大的工业国家。苏联人民的经济和文化的发展速度是历史上所从来没有的。
    我们国家1957年的工业生产量与1913年相比增加了三十二倍。集体农庄的制度已经在农村不可动摇地确立了起来。近几年来党和政府为整个农业的飞跃高涨实行了极其巨大的措施。过去的文化落后的俄国已经变成了一个拥有先进的文化和科学的国家。两个人造地球卫星的发射是苏联在科学和技术方面的卓越的胜利。
    我们的祖国在苏维埃政权存在的四十年里，不只一次地遭到了严厉的考验。曾经有过不少的企图，其中也包括用武装的魔爪，来扼杀世界上第一个社会主义国家，但是，每一次社会主义制度都向全世界显示了它的伟大的生命力、共产党和苏联人民的牢不可破的团结。
    伟大的十月革命的思想、各国人民之间的友谊和和平、民族和社会解放的思想不论是过去和现在对整个世界历史的发展都起着巨大的影响。这些思想在社会主义阵营各国的巨大成就中、在亚洲和非洲各国的民族解放运动的胜利中、在反对战争和主张不同的政治和社会制度的国家和平共处的一切力量的空前增长和加强的事实中，都得到了新的证实和发展。
    十月革命以后，在世界历史的事件中，毫无疑义地，为六亿人民开辟了走向社会主义的道路的中国人民革命的胜利，是最卓越的。伟大的中国人民在中国共产党和它的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下所获得的具有历史意义的成就，使全体苏联人民感到由衷的高兴。
    苏联人民衷心地预祝伟大的中国人民和中国共产党在建设社会主义的事业中获得新的成就。
    我们苏联人民，十分高兴地看到，中国人民这样热情地庆祝十月革命的四十周年。今天北京的节日的光辉和中国劳动人民在这些日子里所表现出的热情，是苏联人民和中国人民这两个战友——社会主义和共产主义的建设者之间的牢不可破的团结和意见的完全一致的又一次鲜明的例证。我们两国人民的伟大友谊和牢不可破的同盟是我们两国在社会主义和共产主义的建设事业中获得进一步成就的可靠保证，是和平和国际安全的有力支柱。
    我提议：
    为伟大的十月革命的光荣的四十周年，
    为苏联和中华人民共和国两国兄弟人民的友谊的进一步发展和巩固，
    为伟大的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党，
    为中国人民的领袖毛泽东主席的健康，
    干杯！
