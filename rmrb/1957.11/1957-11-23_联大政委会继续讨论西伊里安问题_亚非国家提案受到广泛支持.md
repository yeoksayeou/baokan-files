Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd, New York: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion of the West Irian issue at its morning and afternoon sessions on November 21st.

The Czechoslovakian representative, Nosek, supported Indonesia's demand to incorporate West Irian into the Republic of Indonesia at the morning session. He said that the Czechoslovakian delegation agreed with the Asian-African countries' proposal to request the United Nations to invite the parties in dispute to seek a solution.

The Japanese representative, Toru Hagiwara, stated that the Japanese delegation did not support either side on the West Irian issue. However, he said that the Japanese delegation would endorse the Asian-African countries' proposal.

The Afghan representative, Najibullah, supported Indonesia's position, emphasizing that he was doing so out of a desire to promote the independence of people in colonial countries.

The Australian representative, Walker, who has consistently been an ardent defender of colonialist countries in the past, once again insisted on upholding the Netherlands' position on the West Irian issue and crudely distorted the facts.

The head of the Malayan Federation delegation, Rahman, sternly rebuked the defenders of Dutch colonial policy. He emphasized that delaying the resolution of this issue would threaten peace in Southeast Asia.

The Ukrainian Republic representative also spoke at the morning session, warmly supporting Indonesia's just demands and the proposal put forward by the Asian-African countries.

At the afternoon session, representatives from Albania, Belarus, Yugoslavia, Nepal, and Bolivia spoke in support of the Asian-African countries' proposal, while representatives from Belgium, New Zealand, and Costa Rica spoke in defense of the Netherlands' position.

The last speaker at the afternoon session was the Indonesian representative to the United Nations, Sastroamidjojo. He said that many people at the meeting had already exposed the "untenable positions" of the Netherlands and Australia. He pointed out that the West Irian issue was "a purely colonial issue."

The committee is scheduled to continue its meeting on November 22nd.

    过去一贯做殖民主义国家的狂热的辩护人的澳大利亚代表沃克这次仍然坚持维护荷兰在西伊里安问题上的立场，同时还粗暴地歪曲事实。
    马来亚联邦代表团团长拉赫曼严厉地斥责了荷兰殖民政策的维护者。他着重指出，延误解决这个问题，东南亚和平就会遭到威胁。
    在上午会议上发言的还有乌克兰共和国代表，他热烈支持印度尼西亚的正义的要求和亚非国家提出的提案。
