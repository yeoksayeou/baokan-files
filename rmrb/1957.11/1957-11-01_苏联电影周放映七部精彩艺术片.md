    Soviet Film Week to Screen Seven Excellent Art Films
    (Our report) The annual Soviet Film Week will be held in Beijing from November 6th to November 25th, simultaneously in fourteen first-class cinemas and four clubs.
    The films participating in the Film Week include: the color feature films "Prelude to Revolution," "Whirlwind of Hatred," "How the Steel Was Tempered," the black and white feature film "The Calling," and the color animated films "The Wonderful Travels of Nils," "The Ugly Duckling," and "Treasure Bag," a total of seven full-length and short art films.
