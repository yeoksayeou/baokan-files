    The total number of employees has increased from more than 12.9 million in 1913 to 52.6 million; the number of specialists with higher and secondary education in the national economy has reached more than 6.2 million; the various schools under the State Labor Reserve System train a large number of young workers every year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 2nd: The ranks of the Soviet working class have grown more than three times stronger than before the October Revolution. At present, the total number of employees in the country has increased from 12.9 million in 1913 to 52.6 million. The proportion of employees and their families in the total population has increased from 17% in 1913 to 59.5%, totaling 117 million people.
    Among this powerful working class force, employees directly engaged in the production of material wealth account for 85.2%. Employees in other non-production and management departments account for only 14.8%, of which medical and health workers and educators account for 9.2%, and employees in state and economic management agencies and production service agencies account for 5.6%.
    In pre-October Revolution Russia, employees in the industrial and construction sectors accounted for only 9% of the total number of employees in the national economy, now accounting for 31%. Employees in the transportation and postal and telecommunications sectors increased from 2% in 1913 to 6%, and employees in the education and health care sectors increased from 1% in 1913 to 9%. However, employees in agriculture and forestry decreased from 75% in 1913 to 43%, and employees in commerce, state management agencies, and other departments decreased from 13% in 1913 to 11%.
    At present, there are more than 18 million employees working in the national industrial sector. Due to the continuous development of the national economy, the number of workers in the Soviet industrial sector has increased by 3.3 times compared with 1913 before the revolution. The number of workers in heavy industry sectors is particularly large. For example, the number of workers in the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries has increased nearly eight times compared with 1913 before the October Revolution. Due to the increasing number of various constructions, the number of employees in the construction sector is also constantly growing. Currently, there are more than 3.5 million employees working in the construction sector. There are more than 2.8 million employees working in machine tractor stations, and more than 2.9 million employees working in state farms and agricultural enterprises affiliated to state farms. There are more than 5.2 million employees working in the transportation sector. The number of employees working in state and economic management agencies and social organizations has decreased year by year due to the reduction of institutional personnel. In 1940, there were more than 1.8 million employees in this area, but now there are only more than 1.3 million.
    Soviet women play a major role in the development of the national economy. Last year, employed women accounted for 45% of the total number of employed people in the country. Among them, they accounted for 45% in industry, 83% in service industries, 85% in health care, and 67% in education.
    The technical and cultural level of Soviet employees has improved very rapidly. In 1913, before the October Revolution, there were only 190,000 specialists with higher and secondary education in all of Russia, but now, there are more than 6.2 million specialists with higher and secondary education in the Soviet national economy, which is about 32 times more than before the October Revolution.
    The various schools under the State Labor Reserve System train a large number of young workers for various departments of the national economy every year. In the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the labor reserve system trained a total of more than 2.3 million workers, and in 1956 alone, it trained more than 660,000 people.

    苏联工人阶级队伍壮大
    目前职工总数已由1913年的一千二百九十多万人增加到五千二百六十万人；在国民经济中受过高等和中等教育的专门人才达到六百二十多万人；国家劳动后备系统所属的各种学校每年都要训练出大批的青年工人。
    据新华社莫斯科2日电　苏联工人阶级的队伍比十月革命前壮大了三倍多。目前全国职工总数已经由1913年的一千二百九十万人增加到五千二百六十万人。职工和他们家属在全国人口中所占的比例已经由1913年的17％增加到59．5％，共达一亿一千七百万人。
    在这支强大的工人阶级队伍中，直接从事物质财富生产的职工共占85．2％。其他非生产和管理部门的职工仅占14．8％，其中医药卫生和教育工作者占9．2％，国家和经济管理机关以及生产服务机关的职工占5．6％。
    在十月革命前的俄国，工业和建筑部门的职工仅占国民经济中职工总数的9％，现在占31％。运输和邮电部门的职工由1913年的2％增加到6％，教育和卫生保健部门的职工由1913年的1％增到9％。而农业和森林业的职工却由1913年的75％减少到43％，商业、国家管理机关和其他部门的职工由1913年的13％减少到11％。
    目前在全国工业部门工作的职工共达一千八百多万人。由于国民经济不断发展，苏联工业部门的工人数目比革命前1913年增加了三点三倍。重工业部门的工人数目特别多。例如，机器制造和金属加工业的工人比十月革命前1913年增加了将近八倍。由于各种建设的日益增多，建筑部门的职工也在不断增长着，现在在建筑部门工作的职工共有三百五十多万人。在机器拖拉机站工作的职工共有二百八十多万人，在国营农场和附属于国营农场的农业企业中工作的职工共有二百九十多万人。在交通运输部门工作的职工共有五百二十多万人。在国家和经济管理机关以及社会团体中工作的职工，由于裁减机构人员的结果，逐年有所减少。1940年这方面的职工共有一百八十多万人，现在只有一百三十多万人。
    苏联妇女在国民经济的发展中起着很大的作用。去年就业的妇女占全国就业人数的45％。其中，在工业方面占45％，在服务性行业中占83％，在卫生事业方面占85％，在教育方面占67％。
    苏联职工的技术和文化水平提高得非常迅速。在十月革命前的1913年，全俄国仅有十九万名受过高等和中等教育的专门人才，而现在，苏联国民经济中受过高等和中等教育的专门人才达六百二十多万人，比十月革命前增加了约三十二倍。
    国家劳动后备系统所属的各种学校每年给国民经济各部门训练出大批的青年工人。在第五个五年计划中，劳动后备系统共培养出二百三十多万工人，1956年一年就培养出了六十六万多人。
