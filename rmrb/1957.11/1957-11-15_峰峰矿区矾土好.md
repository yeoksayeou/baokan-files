    Fengfeng Mining District's Bauxite is Good
    Hebei Province's Fengfeng Mining District has discovered high-grade bauxite deposits. In some places, the ore is exposed on the surface, while in others, bauxite seams can be found just a few feet or yards below the surface.

    The bauxite in the Fengfeng Mining District, locally known as "alkali cap," can be used to extract metallic aluminum and manufacture refractory materials. The fine steel utensils needed for people's daily lives are also made from bauxite.

    The bauxite in the Fengfeng Mining District is of excellent quality. According to tests by the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau, the alumina content is as high as 63% or more, which is equivalent to the Grade A bauxite from Guye in Hebei Province. Generally, the alumina content ranges from 40% to 57% or more.

    Bauxite is a commodity that sells well both domestically and internationally. Under the leadership of the Fengfeng Mining District, local handicraft production cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives have been organized to mine bauxite without state investment or damage to the ore veins. It is planned to mine more than 15,000 tons of bauxite in the second half of this year for export.

    峰峰矿区矾土好
    河北省峰峰矿区发现高级矾土矿。有的地方矿石露于表面，有的地方下挖几尺几丈就可见到矾土矿层。
    峰峰矿区的矾土，当地俗称“碱子帽”，可以用来提炼金属铝和制造耐火器材。人民日常生活需用的钢精器具也是用矾土提炼制成的。
    峰峰矿区矾土品质优良，经天津商品检验局化验，证明含三氧化二铝最高达63％以上，和河北省古冶矾土甲级货相等，一般都含三氧化二铝40％到57％以上。
    矾土是国内外畅销的商品，峰峰矿区领导部门在国家不投资、又不损伤矿脉的情况下，组织了当地手工业生产合作社和农业生产合作社开采，计划在今年下半年开采一万五千多吨矾土供应出口。
