    Over the past year, maltose factories belonging to the Beijing Sugar and Pastry Company have gradually used sweet potatoes, yams, water chestnuts, taro, and other starchy materials, and even corn cobs (corn stalk cores), to make maltose. This maltose, with a little saccharin added, makes fruit candies that are almost indistinguishable from those made with granulated sugar. Recently, the company also purchased a batch of inexpensive tree starch (bark starch) from Fujian to make maltose.

    The company also used various rotten and discarded pears, dates, apples, persimmons, bananas, and other fruits to make fruit maltose containing a large amount of fructose, without adding malt. From last autumn to this spring, they used a total of more than 300,000 jin of rotten and discarded fruit, replacing 110,000 jin of grain.

    烂水果制饴糖
    北京市糖业糕点公司所属各饴糖厂，一年来逐步利用山芋、凉薯、荸荠、芋头等类淀粉，甚至玉米瓤子（玉蜀黍棒核）熬制成了饴糖。这种饴糖加些糖精制成的水果糖，和用砂糖制成的水果糖几乎没有差别。最近，这个公司还由福建采购到一批廉价的树菽淀粉（树皮淀粉）来熬制饴糖。
    这个公司还利用多种烂弃的梨、枣、苹果、柿子、香蕉等水果，不加麦芽，熬成了含有大量果糖成分的水果饴糖。从去秋到今春，他们共利用了三十多万斤烂弃水果，代替了十一万斤粮食。
