Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Electric Dispatch. Recently, 105,000 Vietnamese Labor Party members in northern Vietnam's rural areas participated in a Party member study movement.

This study movement began in early October and lasted for one month. Its purpose is to raise the class consciousness of rural Party members, recognize the current domestic and international situation and tasks, clarify the goal of striving step-by-step towards socialism, thereby strengthening the sense of responsibility of Party members, consolidating the unity of Party members, and leading the broad masses to better implement the Party and government's various policies and measures in rural areas.

This round of study was conducted in the vast plains of the third and fourth inter-zones, the Left Bank Zone, and four provinces directly under the Central Government. Party members showed great enthusiasm for learning. In some provinces, more than 80% of Party members participated in the study.

According to relevant sources, this study movement has already achieved considerable results. In places where the study was better, the relationship between Party members and the masses, and between Party members themselves, has been further strengthened, and work such as tax collection and purchasing has been carried out more smoothly than before. In some places, after the study, the mutual aid movement is developing rapidly.

It is reported that next year, the vast cities and villages of northern Vietnam will continue to hold Party member study classes to study the revolutionary tasks during the transition to socialist society, in order to lay the ideological foundation for the transition to socialism.

    明确逐步走上社会主义的奋斗目标
    越南农村党员参加学习运动
    新华社河内电　越南北方农村中最近有十万五千名越南劳动党党员参加了党员学习运动。
    这个学习运动是从10月上旬开始的，为期一个月。它的目的是提高农村党员的阶级觉悟，认清当前国内外形势和任务，明确逐步走上社会主义的奋斗目标，从而加强党员的责任感，巩固党员的团结，并且带动广大群众，更好地执行党和政府在农村中的各项政策和措施。
    这一期学习是在第三、四联区，左岸区和直属中央的四个省的广大平原地区进行的。党员学习热情非常高。有些省份参加学习的党员占80％以上。
    据有关人士指出，这次学习运动已经得到相当大效果。凡是学习得比较好的地方，党员和群众、党员和党员之间的关系已经进一步密切起来，税收和收购等工作也比以前进行得顺利。有些地方学习以后，变工运动正在迅速开展。
    据悉，越南北方广大的城市和乡村明年将继续开办党员学习班，学习有关进入社会主义社会的过渡时期的革命任务的问题，以便为过渡到社会主义打下思想基础。
