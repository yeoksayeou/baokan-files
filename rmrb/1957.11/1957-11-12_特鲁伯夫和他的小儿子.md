Trubnikov and His Little Son
Cao Ming

Among the service personnel at the Anshan Iron and Steel Guest House, there wasn't one who didn't love the little fatty. He was not only healthy and lively but could also speak a few words of Chinese and Korean. "I am called Little Fatty, I am called Seryozha." Trubnikov often said to people with a proud tone regarding his son: "This little Soviet citizen was born in Korea and raised in China!"

　　“Papa, when you were my age, did you herd sheep?" On Sundays when he had nothing to do, Seryozha would ask his father to tell him stories of the past that had been repeated countless times.

　　"No, a little older than you are now." His father smiled, the green hills and grasslands of his hometown seeming to appear before his eyes. "Look, you know how big that grassland is. At the time, I wondered how big the world really was, what kind of people lived in those places, what kind of work they did? If I could visit them and help them do something, that would be great..."

　　"So you went to Korea and came to China." Little Fatty eagerly added.

　　The process of Trubnikov transforming from a shepherd boy into a steel rolling expert, going to Korea and China to help with construction, was not as simple as his son said. It is true that Trubnikov herded sheep as a child, and when he grew up, he learned carpentry; he used electric saws and planes to participate in the construction of Magnitogorsk, the largest steel base in the Soviet Union. After this joint enterprise was built, he fell in love with the steel rolling industry and became a steel rolling worker. In his work, he was both diligent and eager to study, and soon became a foreman and section chief. He also went from studying at an amateur middle school to night university, thus becoming an excellent engineer. He often said with heartfelt gratitude and a smile, "I participated in the construction of Magang, and Magang trained me." Isn't it the greatest source of pride for every Soviet citizen that the Soviet regime does not bury the wisdom of every individual, and that every individual has the opportunity to dedicate all of their talents to the motherland?

　　When German fascists attacked the Soviet Union, how could the Soviet people allow the enemy to destroy their peaceful and happy lives? Trubnikov left the factory at that time, put on a military uniform, and participated in the Great Patriotic War. In 1945, Trubnikov was on the Far Eastern border defense. He saw that Japanese imperialists had occupied Northeast China, trampled on the people of the Northeast, and stationed heavy troops, attempting to collude with the dying Hitler to act recklessly against the Soviet Union, and a fire of hatred ignited in his heart. On August 9th, in order to completely defeat Japanese fascism and assist the Chinese people in liberation, he followed the Red Army into Northeast China and liberated Jiamusi and other places. At that time, a group of Japanese soldiers were lurking in caves, stubbornly resisting, and he wished he could immediately annihilate them one by one. However, he was ordered to advance eastward with the vanguard of the Red Army. Wherever the Soviet Red Army went, it was as irresistible as a hot knife through butter; Dong'an, Mudanjiang and other places left the footprints of Trubnikov and his comrades. After the August 15th Japanese surrender, Trubnikov was ordered to advance to Korea to assist the Korean people in liberating Korea. He was not transferred back to his country until the end of the Korean War.

　　After several years of war, having fought in China and Korea, he now returned to the factory he was familiar with. He loved this factory even more, and he felt even more that the labor and work of every Soviet person directly affected the defense of world peace, especially the growth of the socialist camp's strength. He encouraged the workers to roll out the steel needed for the construction of the liberated Chinese and Korean people, who were clearing away the war's devastation.

　　Later, Trubnikov was ordered to go to Korea again to assist the Korean people in construction. The diligence and bravery of the Korean people had eliminated the wounds of war in more than three years, and chimneys were growing like bamboo shoots in the spring bamboo forest. Returning to the old place was as warm as returning to his hometown, and he dedicated all his expertise to the Korean people. During a flood, he also participated in the struggle of flood prevention and drainage with the Korean people. But what he will never forget is that he and his wife welcomed the birth of their youngest son, Seryozha, here. Seryozha's birth was the best commemoration of his two trips to Korea and fighting alongside the Korean people.

　　The second time that steel rolling expert Trubnikov came to China was more than four years after he returned to the Soviet Union from Korea. From Manchuria to Anshan, he could not imagine the scene of peace and prosperity he saw along the way, the Northeast that had been liberated from the iron hooves of Japan only ten years ago. He suddenly became a talkative person, pointing out and explaining the tremendous changes of the past ten years to his wife, eldest daughter, and five-year-old Seryozha along the way, as enthusiastic as a tour guide in a scenic spot. Seryozha was so happy that he shouted, "Papa, let's not go, let's just live here."

　　When he arrived at Anshan Iron and Steel, Trubnikov regarded it as the same as Magang. He knew several steel rolling mills like the back of his hand. If new products were being test-rolled, he would definitely be present to supervise and would not leave the workshop until there were no problems. Once, when test-rolling type B steel in a large steel rolling mill, he stayed in the workshop for a full twenty-four hours. His work was meticulous and serious, and he spent almost all day in the workshop, looking for problems, even correcting the workers' operations himself. There was not a single worker in the main steel rolling workshops of several factories who did not recognize him. He knew exactly whether each rolling mill roll was running smoothly, and how many days which kind of bearing bush could be used. If someone's work was sloppy, he would not tolerate it at all; if someone did their job well, he would immediately praise them. When implementing the very precise and scientific operation charts and scheduling charts in the First Primary Rolling Mill, the implementation was not very good. He invited the factory director to the workshop every day to inspect and find problems, persisting for half a year. After the charts were implemented, production efficiency increased significantly. Trubnikov smiled and said to the factory director, "It's time for us to switch, you find problems, I study." But then he said seriously, "This factory has great potential, and it doesn't need to spend much money or implement major measures to improve production efficiency; as long as we are good at tapping potential from production management and production organization." This man who came from a shepherd boy background and participated in the construction of Magang as a carpenter, deeply knew that building socialism should start from thrift. Once, after reading Premier Zhou's instructions against wasting funds in the newspaper, he immediately removed some of the dispensable measures that were planned for 1957 to 1958. During the two years in Anshan, Trubnikov made significant contributions to the improvement of the service life of various types of rolling mill rolls, the replacement of copper bearing bushes with rubber bearing bushes in the medium-sized steel rolling mill, extending the usage time by five times, and also to increasing the temperature of ingot delivery and improving the quality of large steel.

　　In March of this year, the Trubnikov expert family all returned to their country. People were reluctant to part; he smiled and comforted everyone, saying, "I know this road very well, if you have any difficulties, just let me know and I will come." Seryozha even more sincerely and enthusiastically replied to those uncles and aunts, "When I grow up, I will also come to China to help you do some work."

　　The experience of this ordinary Soviet person reminds us of how the Soviet Communist Party led the working people to build socialism, how it grew and consolidated, and how it demonstrated the spirit of internationalism, assisting the liberation movements of various countries and helping them build socialism. It reminds us of the harmonious mutual assistance of the socialist family, and reminds us of the bright future of mankind! Isn't the fact that Seryozha, who was born in Korea and lived in China, has a deep affection for the people of China and Korea in his young heart, also a good proof?

    特鲁伯夫和他的小儿子
    草明
    鞍钢宾馆的服务员里面，没有一个不爱小胖子的。他不仅健康活泼，还会说几句中国话和朝鲜话。“我叫小胖子，我叫谢略沙。”特鲁伯夫对于自己的儿子，也常用骄傲的口吻对人说：“这个苏联小公民，是在朝鲜生，在中国养的！”
    “爸爸，您像我这么大，就去放羊了么？”星期天没事儿，谢略沙就要父亲给他讲已经重复多少遍的过去的故事。
    “不，还比你现在大一点。”父亲微笑着，故乡那青山、那草原仿佛展现在他眼前。“呶，你知道那片草原有多大。当时我就想，世界究竟有多大，那些地方净住些什么人，干些什么活儿？要是我能去串串门子，帮他们干点什么，那该多好。……”
      “所以您就到朝鲜去，和到中国来了。”小胖子性急地补充说。
    特鲁伯夫从一个牧羊童变成轧钢专家，到朝鲜、中国来帮助建设，这个过程并不是如儿子说的那么简单的。不错，特鲁伯夫小时放过羊，长大后，学了木匠；他就用电锯和刨子参加了苏联最大的钢铁基地马格尼托格斯克的建设。这个联合企业建成以后，他就爱上了轧钢这一行业，成了一名轧钢工人。在工作中他既勤快，又好钻研，不久就当了工长，工段长。他又从念业余中学到夜大学，因此成了一名优秀的工程师。他常常衷心感激地笑着说：“我参加建设了马钢，马钢培养了我。”苏维埃政权不埋没每一个人的智慧，而每一个人都有机会把自己的才能全部献给祖国，这难道不是每个苏联公民最足以自豪的吗？
    德国法西斯进攻苏联，苏联人民那能允许敌人来破坏自己的和平与幸福的生活？特鲁伯夫就在那个时候离开了工厂，换上军装，参加了卫国战争。1945年特鲁伯夫正在远东的边防上。他看见日本帝国主义者侵占了中国的东北，蹂躏东北人民，并屯重兵想配合垂死挣扎的希特勒向苏联蠢动，心中燃起了愤恨的怒火。8月9日，为彻底击溃日本法西斯和协助中国人民解放，他随红军进军东北、解放了佳木斯等地。当时有一股日本人潜伏在山洞里顽抗，他恨不得立刻一个一个歼灭他们。但他又奉命随红军先头部队东进了。苏联红军所到之处，势如破竹；东安、牡丹江等地，留下过特鲁伯夫和他的战友们的足迹。八·一五日本投降以后，特鲁伯夫又奉命向朝鲜进发，协助朝鲜人民解放朝鲜。一直到朝鲜解放战争结束，他才奉调回国。
    经过几年的战争的考验，转战过中国和朝鲜，现在他又回到自己所熟悉的工厂来了。他更爱这个厂，他更觉得每一个苏联人的劳动和工作都直接影响着保卫世界和平，特别是社会主义阵营的力量的增长。他鼓舞工人们要为扫除百孔千疮的解放了的中、朝人民轧出他们建设所需要的钢材。
    后来，特鲁伯夫又奉命赴朝鲜协助朝鲜人民建设。朝鲜人民的勤劳和勇敢，在三年多时间里已消灭了战争的创伤，烟囱像春天竹林里的笋子一样茁长起来了。旧地重来，像回到了故乡那么亲热，他把自己的专长都献给了朝鲜的人民，那一次闹了水灾，他也和朝鲜人一块儿参加抢险防涝的斗争。而最最使他难忘的是，他夫妇俩在这儿迎接了小儿子谢略沙的诞生。谢略沙的出生，是他两次到朝鲜和朝鲜人民一块儿战斗的最好的纪念。
    轧钢专家特鲁伯夫第二次来中国，是他从朝鲜回到苏联四年多以后的事了。从满洲里到鞍山，他不能想像一路所见的升平兴盛的景象，就是十年前从日本的铁蹄下解放出来的东北。他忽然变成一个爱说话的人，沿路给他的夫人、大女儿和五岁的谢略沙指点着，解释着十年来的巨大的变化，像什么名胜区的一个解说员似地热心。逗的谢略沙高兴地嚷着说：“爸爸，咱们不走了，咱们就住在这儿。”
    到了鞍钢，特鲁伯夫把它看成是马钢一样。他把几个轧钢厂摸的熟极啦。要是试轧新产品，他定必亲临监督，多咱不出问题多咱离开车间。那一次在大型轧钢厂试轧乙型钢时，他竟在车间呆了整整二十四小时。他工作是细致、认真的，几乎成天呆车间，找问题，以致亲手纠正工人的操作。几个厂的主要轧钢车间的工人们是没有一个不认得他的。哪个轧辊运转得顺不顺利，什么样的轴瓦能使唤几天，全瞒不过他。要是谁的工作做马虎，他一点也不迁就；要是谁把工作做好了呢，他立刻表扬。在第一初轧厂贯彻那十分精密、科学的操作图表、调度图表的时候贯彻得很不好。他天天邀厂长到车间检查，找问题，坚持了半年。图表贯彻了，生产效率显著提高了。特鲁伯夫笑着对厂长说：“咱该换换啦，你找问题，我学习。”但是随即他正正经经地说：“这个厂有很大的潜力，不用花什么钱，搞大措施，也能提高生产效率；只要我们善于从生产管理、生产组织去挖潜力。”这个牧童出身，以木匠身份参加建设了马钢的人，深知建设社会主义要从勤俭着眼。有一回他读报读了周总理的反对浪费资金的指示之后，立刻把准备在1957到1958年间的可有可无的一些措施方案去掉了。在鞍山二年多的时间里，对于各式轧辊寿命的改进，中型轧钢厂的铜轴瓦改成了树胶轴瓦，延长使用时间为五倍，又对于提高送锭的温度，和提高大型钢材的质量等，特鲁伯夫都有显著的贡献。
    今年3月，特鲁伯夫专家一家子都回国了。人们都依依不舍；他笑着安慰大家说：“这条路我都走熟了，你们要是有困难，招呼一声我就来。”谢略沙更是诚挚热烈地回答那些叔叔和阿姨们说：“我长大了，还要到中国来帮你们干点活儿。”
    这位普通的苏联人的经历，使我们想起了苏联共产党领导劳动人民怎样去建成社会主义，怎样壮大和巩固，又怎样发挥了国际主义精神、协助各国人民的解放运动与帮助他们建设社会主义的伟大的贡献。使我们想起社会主义大家庭的融洽互助，想起了人类的光辉的未来！生在朝鲜，在中国生活过的谢略沙的小小的心灵里，对中、朝人民浸透着深厚的情感，不也是个很好的证明么？
