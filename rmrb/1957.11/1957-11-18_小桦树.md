    Little Birch Tree

    Cherishing orphans is one of the great sentiments of Soviet people. Stubborn, gentle, intelligent... these seem to be the common traits of these orphans. They are like little birch trees in the hearts of their elders, evoking a delightful sense of pride.

    We often hear about orphanages and see orphans in literature and art. Are there particularly many orphans in the Soviet Union? No, the act of gathering orphans together and frequently mentioning their education and achievements in the cause of the people's revolution, as mentioned earlier, is a characteristic of the Soviet people's emotions. Naturally, it is also due to the war, which left behind many children of heroic soldiers. People give their respect and remembrance of heroes to the successors of their comrades.

    I can't remember whether it was in "Lenin in 1918" or "Lenin in October" that there was a touching scene: Lenin with a little girl. This small, unexpected visitor suddenly bursts into Lenin's office, and Lenin embraces and kisses her, then gives her a pen and asks her to draw on the side. Both are working silently, how peaceful, how poetic! She is probably the luckiest representative of orphans. No, if a snotty-nosed boy had barged in, Lenin would certainly have wiped his nose first. Makarenko's "The Road to Life" (both the novel and the film exist) is simply a magical fairy tale. He, like Dzerzhinsky in the latest film "Vortex of Hostility," is full of class love and boldly trusts the group of orphans who began to wander and acquire bad habits. He conquered their deception, wildness, and laziness, enabling them to truly leave their dirty lives and become glorious Soviet people. The immortal hero Matrosov was once one of them. Sura in "The Red Scarf" and Alyosha in the recently staged "The Call of Duty" are also glorious memorials left by the Great Patriotic War. They are representatives of the orphans' strong and sensitive characters. Can we say that they are children without family love? Discovering their genius is not just the concern of a pair of parents, but the duty of all kind and cultured Soviet people. Alyosha becomes an outstanding pianist because someone was so focused on seeking out and developing his talent. Naturally, unpleasant things also occur in their lives. Their little partners in the same family occasionally mention that they are orphans and look at them with discriminatory eyes. But this can never make Sura and Alyosha feel inferior and discouraged, because they are "in the Soviet Union and not in the United States!" (Sura's words) They can immediately go to any familiar family, and people will welcome them as they would a little master. And their original adoptive parents are so reproachful of their children's contempt for orphans, their unease will not be calmed until the children truly admit their mistakes and take the hands of their little partners again. In the novel "Children's Friendship" and the film "The Rumyantsev Case," two orphans join the families of two single men, one a soldier and the other a worker, who almost impatiently teach the children all their knowledge and skills. In their daily lives, the purely maternal love with which they treat the children is something that even the orphans' deceased parents could not have learned! And there is also Sholokhov's "A Man's Destiny," which is about a demobilized soldier and an orphan who seem to be a natural father and son. In the war, they both lost their loved ones. Sokolov decided to recognize the five-year-old orphan Vanya as his own son near the tea house, giving the child unexpected joy. Later, their mutual care and love almost compensated for what they had lost in the war.

    I am truly grateful to the Soviet artists and writers for creating these moving images. Romain Rolland said, "The greatest work of art of the revolution is the people it creates." The Soviet people who cherish orphans and the strong and intelligent orphans are also some of the valuable new types of people created by the October Revolution.

    珍爱孤儿是苏维埃人伟大的感情之一，倔强、温顺、聪明……又仿佛是这些孤儿们的共性，他们是长辈的人们心目中的小桦树。——它在他们心上唤起一种可喜的引为骄傲的感觉。
    常常听说孤儿院，常常在文学艺术作品中看到孤儿，难道苏联的孤儿特别多么？不，把孤儿集中起来，在人民革命事业中常常提到教养孤儿和孤儿们自己的成绩，正如前面所说，是苏维埃人感情上的一种特征；自然也由于战争，多少英勇的战士留下了他们的孩子，人们把对英雄的尊敬和怀念，给了自己同志的继承人。
    记不得“列宁在1918年”还是“列宁在十月”里有一个动人的场面：列宁和小女孩在一起。这个小小的不速之客突然闯进了列宁的办公室，列宁抱吻了她，随后给了她一支笔，请她在一旁作画，两个人默默地都在工作，多么宁静，多么富有诗意！她恐怕是孤儿中最幸运的代表吧，不，如果闯进来的是一个拖鼻涕的男孩子，列宁一定会先替他擦掉鼻涕的。马卡连柯的“教育诗”
  （小说和电影都有）呢，简直是神奇的童话，他和最新的影片“仇恨的旋风”中的捷尔任斯基一样，对开始流浪沾有不良习气的孤儿群，充满了阶级的爱并大胆地信任他们；征服了他们的欺诈、撒野和懒惰，使他们真正离开肮脏的生活，成为光辉的苏维埃人。不朽的英雄马特洛索夫，就曾经是他们中的一个。“红领巾”里的苏拉和最近上演的“天职”中的阿略沙，也是卫国战争留下的光荣的纪念。他们是孤儿们坚强而敏感的性格的代表。难道能说他们是没有家庭宠爱的孩子么？发现他们的天才不仅是一对父母在注视，而是所有善良的有文化的苏维埃人的天职。阿略沙成为出色的钢琴演奏家，就是有人那样专注地在寻觅和发挥他的才能。自然他们的生活中也出现过不愉快的事情，和他们共一个家庭的小伙伴，偶尔也提起他们是孤儿，用歧视的眼光瞧着他们，但这决不能使苏拉和阿略沙自卑而泄气，因为他们是“在苏联而不是在美国！”（苏拉语）他们马上可以到任何一个相熟的家庭中去，人们会像欢迎小主人那样接待他们。而他们原来的义父义母，又多么痛责自己孩子轻视孤儿的行为，直到孩子真正的认错了，把一对小伙伴的手重新拉在一起为止，他们心头的不安才能平静下来。小说“孩子的友情”和电影“鲁勉柴夫案件”中，两个孤儿加入了两个单身男子汉的家庭，他们一个是军人一个是工人，几乎把他们全部的知识和本领，迫不及待地教给了孩子，在日常生活中他们对待孩子那种纯乎母性的爱，就是这两个孤儿死去的父母也是学不到的啊！还有肖洛霍夫的“一个人的遭遇”，也是一个复员的军人和一个孤儿，他们好像是天生的父子俩。在战争中他们都失去了自己的亲人，索科洛夫决心以亲爸爸的身份在茶馆附近认了五岁的孤儿万尼亚，给了孩子意外的喜悦，后来他们相互的关怀和亲爱，几乎报偿了他们在战争中失去的东西。
    对于苏联艺术家和作家们所塑造这些动人的形象，我实在是太感谢了。罗曼罗兰说过：“革命的最最伟大的艺术品是它所创造的人。”珍爱孤儿的苏维埃人和坚强聪慧的孤儿们，也正是十月革命所创造的新型人物中一些可贵的人们。
