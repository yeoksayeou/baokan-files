Now, the nationwide rectification campaign has entered a new stage—the stage of focusing on rectification and reform. This stage is an indispensable and important stage of the entire rectification campaign. If the rectification campaign does not go through this stage, or if this stage is not carried out deeply, thoroughly, or well, the movement can only achieve a partial victory, but not a complete victory. A so-called partial victory is an unsolidified and incomplete victory, a victory that can be lost.

To carry out the stage of focusing on rectification and reform deeply, thoroughly, and well, just like the previous stage—the stage of counterattacking the Rightists—a series of ideological understanding problems must be solved, various ideological obstacles must be overcome, and various erroneous views must be criticized in order to achieve the goals that the rectification and reform stage seeks to achieve, and to realize the demands put forward by the Party Central Committee to the entire Party. The slogans put forward by the Party in this stage are: resolutely unleash, boldly unleash, thoroughly unleash (this is the slogan for the masses); resolutely reform, boldly reform, thoroughly reform (this is the slogan for leading personnel). Whether we can achieve "resolutely, boldly, thoroughly" depends first and foremost on the issue of understanding the significance of rectification and reform. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his report at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee that improving work and fighting the Rightists are of equal importance, and neither aspect should be neglected. This point is worth pondering carefully. Only when the significance of rectification and reform is fully understood can the determination to rectify and reform be greater. This is almost always the case when doing any work or launching any movement. Whoever does not fully understand the "important significance" of this work or movement, or neglects it, will not have great determination, energy, and perseverance. This can be affirmed.

Is it the case that everyone currently regards improving work and fighting the Rightists as equally important? Many people see it that way, and their determination and energy for rectification and reform are as strong as their determination and energy for fighting the Rightists, and their enthusiasm and awareness are equally high. Some people are in the process of seeing it that way, and their determination, energy, enthusiasm, and awareness for rectification and reform are constantly increasing and strengthening. There are also some people who do not see it that way, they do not regard the two as "equally important," but as one heavy and one light, and in reality regard rectification and reform work as "secondarily important." Among them, some are afraid of reform and afraid of unleashing, some want to cover up their own sores, just like Ah Q who had a scab on his scalp and did not want others to expose it, and adopted "angry stares" when someone did expose it; others subjectively regard themselves as "absolutely correct," as if they were "sages" with no shortcomings. Still others adopt a formalistic and perfunctory attitude towards rectification and reform, attempting to evade it and muddle through, not making a serious examination of shortcomings and errors, not making a serious study of methods and steps for improving work, and not making a serious explanation of the opinions of the masses, and so on. What they show in rectification and reform is: little determination, insufficient energy, and low enthusiasm and awareness. Is this acceptable?

Not rectifying and reforming is not acceptable, not mobilizing the masses to rectify and reform is not acceptable, and perfunctory rectification and reform is also not acceptable. Not rectifying and reforming is unfavorable to the Party, the country, the people, and oneself. Not rectifying and reforming, not mobilizing the masses to rectify and reform, or perfunctorily rectifying and reforming will prevent the elimination of shortcomings and errors in work, the further strengthening of the Party's leadership role, the closer relationship between the Party and the masses, the proper handling of contradictions among the people, and the eradication of various problems suffered by individuals, and Rightists and various enemies will have opportunities to exploit. A lively and vigorous political situation with both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and individual ease of mind will not be easily created. Weighing the pros and cons, shouldn't we be determined to rectify and reform? Shouldn't we have the courage to rectify and reform?

    谈整改
    许邦仪
    现在全国的整风运动已经进入了一个新的阶段——着重整改的阶段。这一个阶段是整个整风运动所不可缺少的一个重要阶段。整风运动如果不经过这一个阶段，或者这一个阶段搞得不深、不透、不好，运动就只能取得半胜，而不能取得全胜。所谓半胜，便是不巩固的和不彻底的胜利，便是可以丢掉的胜利。
    着重整改阶段要搞深、搞透、搞好，如同前一个阶段——反击右派阶段一样，有一系列的思想认识问题必须解决，要克服种种的思想障碍，要批判种种的错误看法，才能达到整改阶段所要达到的目的，实现党中央向全党所提出来的要求。党在这一个阶段所提出来的口号，就是：坚决地放，大胆地放，彻底地放（这是对于群众的口号）；坚决地改，大胆地改，彻底地改（这是对于领导人员的口号）。我们能不能做到“坚决、大胆、彻底”，首要的一条还是在于对整改意义的认识问题。邓小平同志在八届三中全会的报告中指明了，改进工作和反右派具有同等重要意义，不可忽视任何一方面。这一点是值得我们深思熟虑一番的。只有对于整改的意义认识得愈充分，整改的决心才能愈大。差不多做任何工作，搞任何运动都是如此。谁如果对于这个工作或运动的“重要意义”认识不足，或者加以忽视，谁的决心、劲头和毅力就会不大。这是可以肯定的。
    是不是目前大家把改进工作和反右派都看成具有同等重要意义了呢？有不少的人是这样看了，他们整改的决心和劲头跟反右派的决心和劲头一样足，积极性和觉悟性都一样高。有一些人正在这样看，他们整改的决心、劲头、积极性和觉悟性正在不断提高和加强。还有一些人不是这样看，他们不是把二者看成“同等重要”，而是看成一重一轻，实际上把整改工作看成为“次等重要”。其中有人是怕改怕放，有人是想掩盖自己的疮疤，就好像阿Q那样在头皮上长了癞疮疤，而不愿别人去揭露，一当有人揭，便采用“怒目主义”；也有人是主观主义地把自己看成为“绝对正确”，看成为和“圣人”一样，似乎在他身上毫无缺点。还有人是对整改采取形式主义的应付态度，企图逃避，蒙混过关，对缺点错误不作认真检查，对改进工作的方法和步骤不作认真研究，对群众的意见不作认真交代，如此等等。他们在整改中表现出来的是：决心不大、劲头不足、积极性和觉悟性不高。这样行不行呢？
    不整改是不行的，不发动群众整改是不行的，马马虎虎整改，也是不行的。不整改，对党、对国、对人民和对自己都是不利的。不整改、不发动群众整改，或者马马虎虎整改，工作中的缺点和错误就不能消除，党的领导作用就不能进一步加强，党和群众的关系就不能更加密切，人民内部矛盾就不能妥善地处理，个人身上所患的各种毛病就不能根治，而右派分子以及各种敌人就会有空子可钻。一个又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅的生动活泼的政治局面也就不易造成。权衡利弊，难道不应当痛下决心整改吗？难道不应当拿出勇气整改吗？
