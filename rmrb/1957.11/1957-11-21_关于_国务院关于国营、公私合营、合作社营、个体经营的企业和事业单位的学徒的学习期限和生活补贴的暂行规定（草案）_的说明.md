Explanation Regarding the "Provisional Regulations (Draft) of the State Council Concerning the Apprenticeship Period and Living Allowances for Apprentices in State-Owned, Joint State-Private, Cooperative, and Individually-Operated Enterprises and Institutions"
    Minister of Labor, Ma Wenrui

    Since the nationwide liberation, in order to adapt to the rapid recovery and development of the national economy, all departments have trained a large number of new workers, the vast majority of whom were trained through the master-apprentice system. This played a significant role in resolving the difficulty of a severe shortage of skilled workers at the time. However, the apprenticeship system implemented in the past few years also had relatively serious shortcomings. First, the apprenticeship period was too short. Most apprentices studied for only half a year, a year, or three months, and only a few studied for a longer period of one and a half or two years. From the perspective of the urgent need to supplement a large number of new workers at the time, it was unavoidable to adopt this short-term training method. However, in the long run, the excessively short apprenticeship period would inevitably lead to a low quality of new workers. The actual situation is exactly like this. Many apprentices still cannot operate independently from their masters after completing their apprenticeship, many young workers can only operate on a simple process, and once the process is changed or the workpiece is replaced, they cannot operate. When encountering machine failures and technical problems, they are even more helpless. Moreover, young workers cause a relatively large number of defective products, waste products, and accidents. Second, the benefits were too high. According to the State Statistical Bureau's 1956 annual industrial statistics report, the average monthly living allowance for apprentices in large industrial enterprises across the country was 28.65 yuan. In some cities, the standard of living allowances for apprentices was as high as 35 yuan or 39 yuan, and in individual cases even 48 yuan. After apprentices completed their short-term studies and graduated, they were promoted too quickly, generally becoming Grade 3 workers immediately after graduation, or at least Grade 2 workers, and then promoted to Grade 4 or Grade 5 workers in another two or three years. The result of excessively high benefits is that many apprentices and young workers have developed a sense of pride and complacency. They are often satisfied with simple operating skills and a smattering of knowledge, and do not work hard to study and improve their skills. They even look down on veteran workers and cannot cooperate well with them. Some even live extravagantly and wastefully, ignoring hard work in terms of ideological awareness. Under the influence of the shortcomings of the current apprenticeship system, the employment opportunities for young people have also become narrow. Originally, in addition to modern industry, China's agriculture could accommodate a larger amount of labor, but because the treatment of apprentices and young workers was too high, it fueled the one-sided view of many young people who value industry over agriculture, and they only want to be industrial workers and do not want to be farmers. Originally, China's handicrafts, service industries, and the vast individual manual or mental laborers could recruit and train a large number of apprentices, but because the treatment of apprentices was too high, they were unwilling to recruit and train apprentices. All of the above are undoubtedly unfavorable to China's construction cause and the youth themselves. China is a country with a large population and a backward economy. Everything should be done in accordance with the principles of building the country industriously and thriftily, managing households industriously and thriftily, taking overall consideration into account, and making appropriate arrangements. On the issue of training young apprentices, is it better to set the treatment higher and train fewer, or to set the treatment lower and train more? Is it better to allow a few young people to enjoy obviously high treatment prematurely while most young people cannot find employment, or to try to provide more employment opportunities for more young people? Obviously, only lower treatment and more training is correct, suitable for China's actual situation, and beneficial to the country and the youth. The purpose of formulating this regulation now is to fundamentally change the current inappropriate apprenticeship system, gradually establish a new apprenticeship system that is suitable for China's basic characteristics of a large population and a backward economy, so that the vast number of young people can obtain more employment opportunities, and so that the vast number of apprentices can truly be trained to become a new generation of China's working class with good skills, good ideology, and good health, in order to ensure the victorious advancement of China's socialist construction cause.
    The following is an explanation of some of the main issues in the regulations.
    The age of apprentices stipulated here should generally be over sixteen years old. This is because sixteen years old is a more suitable age for young people to start working, and it is inappropriate for apprentices to be too young. However, for some special industries that must recruit apprentices of a younger age (such as apprentices learning acrobatics and dance), the age can be lowered. Some people advocate stipulating a minimum age for apprentices. Considering the complex situation of some special industries, it is difficult to make a unified regulation.
    The apprenticeship period stipulated in the new regulations is three years. Some people doubt whether three years is a bit long. We believe that this period is not long. In the old society, apprentices could only learn a limited amount of things, and it took three years and one festival to graduate. Today, what we require is not only that apprentices can master a technology or business they are engaged in, but also that apprentices can learn multiple technologies and businesses; not only must they be proficient in practical operation, but also understand the relevant basic theories; in addition to this, they must also learn the necessary political and cultural knowledge, and strengthen ideological and physical training during the learning period. Therefore, there should be a relatively ample amount of time. Moreover, for some jobs with particularly complex technology, the apprenticeship period should be longer than three years. As for a small number of jobs with relatively simple technology, it is also allowed to appropriately shorten the apprenticeship period, but it must not be less than two years at the shortest, otherwise, it is impossible to achieve the above training goals.
    The new regulations stipulate that the living allowances for apprentices during the learning period should be based on providing meals plus a small amount of pocket money. Because apprentices are in the learning and training period, and have not yet made any contribution to society, excessively high treatment is harmful and useless, and should not be. The new standard is not low compared with the treatment of general low-level workers, secondary vocational school graduates, and the labor income of general rural youth. Especially after the new standard is implemented, it will enable more young people to be employed, which is even more beneficial to the entire young generation.
    This regulation also stipulates that after apprentices have completed their apprenticeship, passed the examination, and become formal workers and staff members, the wage treatment in the first year will be implemented according to the lowest wage standard for workers and staff members in the unit. This is also to avoid young apprentices being promoted too quickly and receiving excessively high treatment immediately after completing their studies and entering the work position, so that they can continue to learn and train humbly and diligently, and maintain good relations with veteran workers.
    The lengthening of the apprenticeship period and the reduction of treatment during the learning period will not only be a major reform of China's current apprenticeship system, but will also have a greater impact on the labor organization and wage system of China's enterprises and institutions, and will have corresponding changes to the labor force arrangement, technical grade standards for workers and staff members, the promotion system for workers and staff members, and the average wage level of enterprises and institutions. This will further adapt to the basic situation of China's large population and backward economy.

    关于“国务院关于国营、公私合营、合作社营、个体经营的企业和事业单位的学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定（草案）”的说明
    劳动部部长　马文瑞
    全国解放以来，适应国民经济的迅速恢复和发展，各部门曾经培养了大批新工人，其中绝大部分是采取师傅带徒弟的方式培养的，这对于解决当时技术工人十分缺乏的困难，是起了很大作用的。但是，过去几年实行的学徒制度，也存在着比较严重的缺点。一是学习期限太短。多数学徒只学习半年、一年或者三个月，少数学习时间较长的也只有一年半或者二年。这从当时急需补充大量新工人的情况来说，采取这种短期培养的办法也是难免的。但是，从长远来说，学徒的学习期限过短，毕竟会造成新工人的质量不高。实际情况也正是这样，许多学徒在出师以后仍然不能够离开师傅独立操作，许多青年工人只会在一个简单的工序上操作，一旦改变工序或者更换工作物，就不会操作了，遇到机器故障和技术上的难题，更是束手无策，并且，青年工人所造成的次品、废品和发生的事故，也是比较多的。二是待遇偏高。据国家统计局1956年工业统计年报，全国大型工业企业学徒的月平均生活补助为28．65元。有些城市的学徒生活补贴标准高达35元、39元，个别的甚至有48元的。而在学徒经过短期学习出师以后，升级又太快，一般的一出师就是三级工、至少二级工，再过二、三年又升为四级工、五级工。待遇过高的结果，使得许多学徒和青年工人产生了骄傲自满情绪，他们往往满足于简单的操作技能和一知半解，而不去努力钻研提高技术，甚至瞧不起老工人，不能够和老工人很好地团结合作；有的还在生活上铺张浪费，忽视了思想意识方面的刻苦锻炼。在现行学徒制度的弊病的影响下，还使得青年们就业的门路狭窄了。本来，除了现代工业而外，我国的农业可以容纳更大量的劳动力，但是由于学徒和青年工人的待遇过高，就助长了许多青年的重工轻农的片面观点，只愿意当产业工人，不愿意当农民。本来，我国的手工业、服务性行业以及广大的个体体力或脑力劳动者是可以招收培养大量学徒的，但是由于学徒的待遇过高，就使得他们不愿意招收和培养学徒了。上述种种，对于我国建设事业和青年本身，无疑地都是不利的。我国是一个人口众多而经济还落后的国家，一切事情都应该本着勤俭建国、勤俭持家、统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针去办。在培养青年徒工这个问题上，究竟是待遇定得高一点少培养一些好呢，还是待遇低一点多培养一些好呢？是让少数青年过早地享受显然偏高的待遇而多数青年无法就业好呢，还是尽量使更多的青年就业好呢？很明显的，只有待遇低一点、多培养一些才是正确的，适合于我国实际情况的，是对国家和青年都有益的。现在制定这个规定的目的，就在于要根本改变现行的不适当的学徒制度，逐步建立起一套适合于我国人口多而经济落后这一基本特点的新的学徒制度，使广大青年能够获得更多的就业机会，使广大学徒能够真正培养成为技术好、思想好、身体好的我国工人阶级的新生一代，以保证我国社会主义建设事业的胜利前进。
    以下，对规定中的几个主要问题，作一些说明。
    这里规定的学徒的年龄，一般应该在十六周岁以上。这是因为十六周岁是青少年开始从事劳动的较适宜的年龄，学徒的年龄过小是不适当的。但是必须招收年龄更小的学徒的某些特殊行业（例如学习杂技、舞蹈的学徒），可以降低年龄。有人主张规定一个学徒的最低年龄。我们考虑到一些特殊行业的情况很复杂，不好作统一规定。
    新规定的学徒的学习期限为三年。有人怀疑三年是否长了一点。我们认为这个期限是不算长的。在旧社会里，学徒只能够学习有限的一点东西，都要三年零一节才能出师。而今天我们所要求的，不仅要学徒能够精通他所从事的一项技术或者业务，并且要求学徒能够学会多种技术、业务；不仅要实际操作熟练，还要懂得有关的基础理论；除此而外，还要学习必需的政治和文化知识，要在学习期间加强思想意识的锻炼和体格的锻炼。所以应该有比较充裕的时间。并且，某些技术特殊复杂的工种，学徒的学习期限还应该长于三年。至于少数技术确实比较简单的工种，也允许适当缩短学习期限，但是最短也不得少于二年，否则，也是不可能达到上述培养目标的。
    新规定的学徒在学习期间的生活补贴，按照管伙食另加少数零用钱为标准。因为学徒是在学习锻炼期间，对社会还没有什么贡献，待遇过高是有害无益的，不应该的。而新准标同一般低级工人、中等专业学校毕业生的待遇及一般农民青少年的劳动收入比较起来，也不算低的。尤其是实行了新标准以后，就可以使得更多的青年能够就业，这对于整个青年一代说来，更是有好处的。
    这个规定中还规定了学徒在学习期满、考试及格转为正式工人、职员以后，第一年的工资待遇执行所在单位工人、职员的最低工资标准。这也是为了避免青年徒工在刚刚学成走上工作岗位的时候，升级太快和待遇一下提得过高，使他们能够继续虚心刻苦地学习锻炼，并且同老工人保持良好的关系。
    学徒学习期限的加长和学习期间待遇的降低，将不仅是我国现行学徒制度的一个重大改革，并且会对于我国企业、事业的劳动组织和工资制度，产生较大的影响，对于企业、事业的劳动力安排、工人职员的技术等级标准，工人职员的升级制度以及平均工资水平等等，都有相应的变化。这将更进一步地适合于我国人口众多而经济还落后这个基本情况。
