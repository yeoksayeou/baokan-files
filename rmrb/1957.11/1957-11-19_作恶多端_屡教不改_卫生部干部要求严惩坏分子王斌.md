	Ministry of Health Cadres Demand Severe Punishment for Bad Element Wang Bin

    (Our Dispatch) Recently, cadres from the Ministry of Health and its directly affiliated units in Beijing held a series of meetings to expose and criticize the series of criminal activities of anti-Party element Wang Bin.

    Bad element Wang Bin came from a landlord family and served as a major military medical officer in the Kuomintang. After being captured by the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in 1933, he joined the work and sneaked into the Chinese Communist Party in 1936. He successively served as the president of the China Medical University, the Minister of Health of Northeast China, and the Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Health. He is currently an editor and reviewer at the People's Medical Publishing House. In 1952, when Wang Bin was working in the Northeast Ministry of Health, he was punished with removal from his post within the Party for embezzlement, bribery, misappropriation of public funds, extravagance, waste, and undermining the state's financial and economic system. In 1954, he was punished with the removal of his Party and administrative posts for illegally remarrying with his concubine and female hooligan Zhang Yunqing and violating Party policies. During this period, Wang Bin not only did not sincerely repent, but instead intensified a series of anti-Party activities, scolding the Party organization as "shackles" and "vortexes," and Party leaders as "Qin Huis" and "King Zhous," and slandering the new society as "new feudalism." He instructed the female hooligan Zhang Yunqing to change her name and fabricate history, posing as a Party member to deceive the organization, and colluded with individuals with unclear political backgrounds to write anonymous letters accusing the Ministry of Health's Party group of being a sectarian clique, slandering the organization, and undermining the Party's leadership. Moreover, his life became even more corrupt and degenerate, for which he was expelled from the Party in 1955.

    Although bad element Wang Bin has received multiple rounds of education and handling from the Party and the state, he has not only failed to sincerely repent and start anew, but has become even more resentful of the Party. Taking advantage of the Party's proposal to correctly handle contradictions among the people and the rectification campaign, he rampantly carried out a series of anti-Party activities, attempting to overturn the Central Committee's correct handling of him. This March, Wang Bin, under the pretext of so-called appeals to the Central Committee, fabricated and distorted facts, falsely accusing certain comrades responsible for handling his case of conducting "political persecution" against him, and "subjectively" first affirming that he was an anti-Party element, and then using his "marriage problems" to "rectify" him. He also spread rumors everywhere, saying that he was "wronged" and that he was being subjected to "retaliation." What was particularly malicious was that when the right-wing elements were frantically attacking the Party, bad element Wang Bin became even more arrogant and domineering, running around and attacking the Party, falsely accusing the Party's handling of him as not being based on investigation, but on "extracting confessions by coercion and believing them," spreading rumors such as "The Ministry of Health made a mistake in handling the case, and the comrades of the original investigation team have confessed to the Central Committee, and so-and-so has been punished," attempting to confuse the masses and win sympathy to achieve the purpose of reversing the verdict and attacking the Party. He also arrogantly declared, "I will not go to work unless my Party membership, reputation, and position are restored; I will not go to work unless so-and-so is punished," and so on. What was even more despicable and vicious was that he instructed his concubine and female hooligan Zhang Yunqing, under the pseudonym Liu Zheng, to submit articles to Wenhui Daily to stir up trouble, falsely claiming that "there is extremely serious bureaucracy and sectarianism in the Ministry of Health, and the so-called leading cadres headed by ×× are acting arbitrarily, suppressing and attacking others, disregarding the interests of the Party and the people, and squeezing health science experts (referring to Wang Bin) out of the Ministry of Health. In order to achieve the purpose of sectarian monopoly, they even fabricated political persecution." He also instigated Zhang Yunqing to make a scene at the Ministry of Health, the Party Committee of State Organs, and other places, scolding the organization and individual responsible comrades, calling the Communist Party "selling dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton" and "violating human rights," and calling the Party's handling of Wang Bin "framing and wronging a good cadre who has made contributions to the Party and the people."

    Despite several rounds of reasoning struggles and multifaceted exposure of Wang Bin's above-mentioned crimes, Wang Bin has not made any self-criticism of his serious errors.

    The comrades participating in the meeting were extremely indignant at Wang Bin's consistent anti-Party and anti-people crimes, and the fact that he still does not admit his mistakes. Many comrades also cited that Wang Bin was already corrupt and degenerate and playing with women when he was president of the Medical University in Yan'an, having molested female nurses and female students. After arriving in the Northeast, he raped female translators and female doctors, and also used the shameful methods of threats, inducements, deception, and bribery to rape his nanny. The comrades' exposure proved that Wang Bin is not only a corrupt and degenerate element, but has also consistently been a criminal who embezzled, took bribes, and spent money like water. Since 1945, when Wang Bin led the China Medical University from Yan'an, he began to grab money everywhere and has been embezzling for many years. During the Three-Anti campaign in 1952, he was punished for crimes such as embezzlement, bribery, and misappropriation of public funds. Wang Bin's extremely corrupt and degenerate lifestyle and despicable and shameless behavior have long lost the moral qualities that a state cadre should possess. Politically, Wang Bin has also committed serious errors. He once used his authority to introduce and heavily employ several counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, and also shielded some of his counter-revolutionary relatives, repeatedly instructing them to fabricate history and conceal crimes in previous political movements. For example, he appointed An Tianyou, a special agent of the puppet "Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense," as the director of the radiology department of China Medical University (An was brought to justice in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries). In order to defend the cause of the Party and defend socialism, they unanimously demanded that this bad element, who has committed many evils, repeatedly refused to repent, and is despicable and evil, be severely punished.

    作恶多端　屡教不改
    卫生部干部要求严惩坏分子王斌
    本报讯　卫生部及在京直属单位干部最近曾连续举行集会，揭发和批判反党分子王斌的一系列罪恶活动。
    坏分子王斌出身于地主家庭，曾任国民党少校军医官。1933年被中国工农红军俘虏后参加工作，1936年混入中国共产党。先后担任过中国医科大学校长、东北卫生部长、中央卫生部副部长等职务，现任人民卫生出版社编审。1952年王斌在东北卫生部工作时，即因贪污受贿、挪用公款、挥霍浪费，破坏国家财经制度，受到党内撤销工作的处分。1954年因与其姘妇女流氓张云清非法重婚及违反党的政策等错误，受到撤销党内外职务的处分。王斌在此期间不仅未痛改前非，反而变本加厉进行了一系列的反党活动，谩骂党组织是“枷锁”、“旋涡”，党的负责人是“秦桧”、“纣王”，污蔑新社会是“新封建”。指使女流氓张云清改名换姓，伪造历史，冒充党员欺骗组织，纠合政治面目不清分子写匿名信控告卫生部党组是宗派小集团，诽谤组织，破坏党的领导。而他的生活更加腐化堕落，为此于1955年被开除党籍。
    坏分子王斌虽受到党和国家的多次教育处理，但他不仅未真诚悔改重新作人，反而对党更加仇恨，借党提出正确处理人民内部矛盾及整风的机会，猖狂地进行了一系列的反党活动，企图推翻中央对他的正确处理。今年3月王斌以所谓向中央控诉为名，捏造和歪曲事实，诬蔑负责处理他的问题的某些同志是对他进行“政治陷害”，是“根据主观愿望”首先肯定他是反党分子，然后再利用他的“婚姻问题”“整”他。并到处散布流言蜚语，说自己是“冤枉了”，对他是“打击报复”。尤其恶毒的是当右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，坏分子王斌更耀武扬威，飞扬跋扈，四出奔走，向党进攻，诬蔑党对他的处理不是根据调查，而是“逼供信”，造谣“卫生部处理错了，原检查组同志已纷纷向中央坦白，某某已受了处分”等谰言，企图迷惑群众争取同情，达到翻案和向党进攻的目的。他并狂妄地宣称“不恢复我的党籍、名誉、地位，我不能去工作；不处分某某我不去工作”等等。更卑鄙狠毒的是指使他的姘妇女流氓张云清化名刘正向文汇报投稿点火，诬蔑说：“卫生部有极其严重的官僚主义，宗派主义，以××为首的所谓领导干部，作威作福，排挤打击别人，不顾党与人民群众利益，将卫生科学专家（指王斌）排挤到卫生部以外去，为了达到宗派垄断的目的，甚至制造政治陷害。”又怂恿张云清去卫生部、国家机关党委等处大闹，辱骂组织和个别负责同志，骂共产党是“挂羊头卖狗肉”“侵犯人权”，骂党对王斌的处理是“陷害和冤枉了对党对人民有功的好干部”。
    王斌以上罪行，虽然经过数次说理斗争和多方面的揭露，王斌对自己如此严重的错误并不作任何检查。
    参加会议的同志对王斌一贯反党反人民的罪行，以及他至今还不承认错误，极为愤慨。许多同志还列举出王斌远在延安当医大校长时就已腐化堕落玩弄女性，曾经调戏过女护士、女学生，到东北后又奸污过女翻译、女医生，并且还以威胁利诱、欺骗收买的可耻手法，奸污了他的保姆。从同志们的揭露中证明王斌不但是一个腐化堕落分子，而且一贯是一个贪污受贿、挥金如土的犯罪分子。自1945年王斌带着中国医科大学由延安出发时，就开始到处抓钱，多少年来一直贪污。1952年三反时曾因贪污受贿、挪用公款等罪行，受到处分。王斌在生活上极端腐化堕落，卑鄙无耻的行为早已丧失了国家干部所应有的道德品质。在政治上王斌也犯有重大错误，他曾利用职权，先后引进、重用了好几个反革命分子和坏分子，并且还包庇了他的一些反革命亲属，在历次政治运动中，多方指使他们伪造历史，隐瞒罪恶。如他曾将伪“国防部二厅”的特务安天佑任用为中国医科大学放射线科主任（安犯在镇反中已被法办）。为了捍卫党的事业，捍卫社会主义，一致要求对这个作恶多端、屡教不改、卑鄙恶劣的坏分子以严厉处分。
