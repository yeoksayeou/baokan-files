The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held a solemn and grand meeting to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Representatives of the working class and the broad masses of people from all over the world participated in this grand event. This was a summary conference of the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union's forty years of construction, a gathering of proletarian international solidarity, and a victorious demonstration of the world's forces of peace. Comrade Khrushchev delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Forty Years of the Great October Socialist Revolution." He summarized the glorious achievements of the Soviet regime over forty years, pointed out the inspiring and great prospects for Soviet communist construction, and thoroughly analyzed the international significance of the October Revolution and the enormous growth of world socialist forces. Comrade Khrushchev emphasized that the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is the basis of Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet Union has always unswervingly pursued a peace-loving policy, striving to reach mutually acceptable agreements with Western countries on various issues related to disarmament. Comrade Khrushchev also proposed that high-level talks be held between capitalist and socialist countries to resolve international disputes through peaceful negotiations and through peaceful competition in developing the economy, culture, and better meeting people's spiritual and material needs. Comrade Khrushchev's report will undoubtedly further enhance the infinite confidence of the Soviet people and the people of the world in the victorious future of the cause of world peace and communism.

At this meeting, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also passed a letter to the working people, political and social activists, scientists and cultural figures, parliaments and governments of all countries in the world, calling on the people of all countries to actively launch activities to stop a new war and to grasp the cause of peace in their own hands. This appeal is very timely, and it will surely further mobilize the people of the world to fight for the defense of world peace.

The people of the socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union, need peace to build their great countries. They do not need war, so they have always unswervingly struggled to maintain world peace. All peace-loving countries and peoples in the world also yearn for a peaceful international environment. A vast area of peace, encompassing more than half of humanity, has now been formed in the world. Compared with the forces of war, the forces of peace are now clearly surpassing the forces of war, which provides a reliable guarantee for the cause of peace. Any provocative actions by imperialism will be met with a fatal blow. As Chairman Mao Zedong said at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "If the imperialist heroes are determined to launch a third world war, they will get nothing but the fundamental demise of the world capitalist system." Chairman Mao Zedong's words reflect the strength of the world's peace forces and the victorious confidence in the future of the world.

However, we still cannot relax our vigilance against the war provocateurs in the slightest. As Comrade Khrushchev said: "We deny the statement that war is inevitably inevitable. But it is also impossible to say absolutely that war will not happen. Everyone knows that in some capitalist countries, there are still people in high positions calling for war. Can these lunatics be trusted?"

In fact, today's imperialist aggressive bloc, headed by the United States, in view of the continued sharpening of the general crisis of capitalism, in addition to stepping up their attacks on the domestic people and the colonial people, they also look forward to launching a war to save their dying fate. They are engaged in frantic foreign aggression, expansion, and arms expansion and war preparations. They establish military bases, organize military blocs, actively pursue nuclear weapons competition, constantly carry out the Cold War to aggravate international tensions, and constantly plan new wars of aggression. At present, the United States is colluding with Turkey in an attempt to invade Syria and rekindle the flames of war in the Middle East. These actions seriously threaten world peace. In this case, in order to ensure that world peace is not undermined, all peace-loving forces must strengthen unity and more actively rise up to fight against the war conspiracies of the imperialist aggressive bloc. Eliminating the threat of war and establishing lasting peace depends on the joint efforts of all peace-loving people in the world. Therefore, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union calls on all peace-loving people to actively launch activities to prevent a new war, and calls on the people and governments of all countries to: persistently strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and for international cooperation; universally reduce armaments and armies, and ban atomic and hydrogen weapons; strive to reach an agreement on the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons tests; establish a European and Eurasian collective security system; strive to develop economic and cultural ties between countries, and strengthen international trust. All of these are the current urgent tasks of the cause of world peace. If these tasks are accomplished, the threat of war can be eliminated, and peace can be ensured. Therefore, the solemn appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will undoubtedly receive the widespread support and response of the people of the world.

Strengthening international cooperation and defending world peace is the consistent proposition of the Chinese people. We resolutely support the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and more closely unite with the Soviet people and the peace-loving people of the world to defeat all the conspiracies of the warmongers to undermine peace, and strive to the end for lasting world peace. At present, the cause of world peace has more favorable conditions than ever before. As long as all peace-loving people take more active action and grasp the cause of peace in their own hands, peace can certainly be maintained, and the war conspiracies of the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States are bound to fail.

### 把和平事业掌握在人民手里

    把和平事业掌握在人民手里
    苏联最高苏维埃为庆祝十月革命四十周年，举行了庄严隆重的会议。世界各国的工人阶级和广大人民的代表，都参加了这个盛会。这是苏联四十年建设辉煌成就的总结大会，是无产阶级国际团结的大会，也是世界和平力量胜利示威的大会。赫鲁晓夫同志在会上作了“伟大的十月社会主义革命四十年”的报告。他总结了苏维埃政权四十年的光辉成就，指出了苏联共产主义建设的鼓舞人心的伟大前景，透彻地分析了十月革命的国际意义和世界社会主义力量的巨大增长。赫鲁晓夫同志着重指出，不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则是苏联外交政策的基础，苏联始终不渝地奉行着爱好和平的政策，力求同西方国家就有关裁军方面的各个问题达成彼此都能接受的协议。赫鲁晓夫同志还提出希望资本主义国家和社会主义国家举行高级会谈，以便通过和平谈判，通过发展经济、文化和更好地满足人们精神和物质需求方面的和平竞赛，来解决国际争端。赫鲁晓夫同志的报告，无疑将进一步增强苏联人民和全世界人民对于世界和平事业和共产主义事业的胜利前途的无限信心。
    在这次会议上，又通过了苏联最高苏维埃告世界各国劳动人民、政治和社会活动家、科学和文化人士、议会和政府书，呼吁各国人民积极展开制止新战争的活动，把和平事业掌握在自己的手里。这个呼吁是十分适时的，它必将进一步动员全世界人民为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国人民需要和平来建设他们伟大的国家。他们不需要战争，因此他们始终不渝地为维护世界和平而奋斗。全世界爱好和平的国家和人民也渴望有一个和平的国际环境。现在世界上已经形成了一个拥有人类半数以上的广阔的和平地区。同战争力量比较起来，目前和平力量显然已经超过了战争力量，这就为和平事业提供了可靠的保证。帝国主义的任何挑衅行动将遭到致命的打击。毛泽东主席在苏联最高苏维埃会议上说：“如果帝国主义好汉们决心发动第三次世界大战，他们除了促使世界资本主义制度根本灭亡以外，不会得到什么别的结果。”毛泽东主席的这些话，正反映出世界和平力量的强大和对于世界前途的胜利信心。
    但是，我们仍然不能丝毫放松对于战争挑拨者的警惕。正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说的：“我们否定战争是注定不可避免的说法。但是，绝对地说战争不会发生也是不行的。大家知道，在某些资本主义国家里，还有一些身居国家高位的人物在号召战争。难道能够信赖这些疯子吗？”
    实际上，今天以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团，鉴于资本主义总危机的继续尖锐化，它们除了加紧对国内人民和殖民地人民的进攻以外，还指望着发动战争，以挽救它们垂危的命运。他们进行疯狂的对外侵略扩张和扩军备战活动。它们建立军事基地，组织军事集团，积极实行核武器竞赛，不断进行冷战以加剧国际紧张局势，并且不断策划新的侵略战争。目前美国正同土耳其勾结在一起，企图侵略叙利亚，在中东重新燃起战火。他们的这些行动，严重地威胁着全世界的和平。在这种情况下，为了确保世界和平不致遭受破坏，一切爱好和平的力量必须加强团结，更加积极地起来为反对帝国主义侵略集团的战争阴谋而斗争。消除战争的威胁和建立持久的和平，要依靠全世界一切爱好和平的人民的共同努力。因此，苏联最高苏维埃呼吁所有爱好和平的人民，积极展开防止新战争的活动，号召各国人民和政府：坚持不懈地为争取不同社会制度的国家和平共处、为国际合作而奋斗；普遍裁减军备和军队、禁止原子武器和氢武器；争取就立即停止原子武器和氢武器试验达成协议；建立欧洲和欧亚集体安全体系；努力发展各国之间的经济和文化联系，加强国际信任。这一切都是世界和平事业当前的急迫任务，实现这些任务，战争的威胁便可消除，和平就可得到确切的保证。因此，苏联最高苏维埃的庄严的呼吁，无疑地必将获得全世界人民的广泛支持和响应。
    加强国际合作，保卫世界和平是中国人民一贯的主张。我们坚决地支持苏联最高苏维埃的呼吁，更加紧密地同苏联人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，击破战争贩子们破坏和平的一切阴谋，为世界持久和平而奋斗到底。目前世界和平事业有着比过去任何时候都更加有利的条件。只要一切爱好和平的人民更加积极地行动起来，把和平事业掌握在自己的手里，和平是一定能够保持的，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团的战争阴谋是一定要失败的。
