    On the Grassland: A Warm Current
    —Sketches from the Frontier
    Gu Gong	
    Walking out of the forest where my eyes were always covered by green leaves, a blue sky and a green field unfolded before me, stretching forward, stretching forward, all the way to where the green and blue merged... What vast beauty! What pure beauty!
    Oh, the wildflowers on the grassland! Surrounding me, caressing me, embracing me... They吐吐out thousands of fragrant wisps from thousands of small mouths; they made thousands of expressions with thousands of small faces: some shy, some playful, some bashful, some bold; some like strings of strung pearls, some like a团团 of colorful silk tied together....
    Several Tibetan children herding sheep were picking handfuls of flowers. When I passed by, they threw bouquets on my hat, on my horse.... I stopped a child riding on a sheep's back and asked his name, but he pulled my sleeve and asked in return:
    "Are you the road builders?"
    "Yes!"
    "Are you a soldier?"
    "Yes! Yes!"
    The children became even more active, vying to tell me their names: "My name is Zhawa"—the child riding on the sheep's back jumped down from the sheep's back and said very spiritedly: "My name is Ni... Nima"—this little girl had a freshly picked mushroom in her mouth, so she didn't speak very clearly; "My name is Zhuoma"—this little girl covered her face after speaking and hid behind others....
    The children swirled around me, the children laughed around me. They looked at my watch in surprise, they pulled out my pen in astonishment, they curiously opened the zipper on my small leather bag.... Suddenly, the child who had been riding on the sheep's back became very serious and asked me very earnestly:
    "Have you ever seen an iron yak?"
    "Is it a car?"
    "No, it isn't."
    "Is it a tractor?"
    "Oh! Oh! The one that turns the land..."
    "I've seen it, I think you will see it on this grassland in the future..."
    I originally wanted to continue: Perhaps you will be driving it in the future? But I was afraid that the children would not understand it for a while; but the children seemed to have completely understood it before I could say it. They all fell silent and quiet, only shifting their渴待的, hopeful eyes to the distance, to the far east....
          Warm Current
    On a night when even the moon was frozen pale, we crossed one silvery mountain peak after another. Occasionally we encountered a few 雪松, they were also shivering! Shaking off the snowflakes piled on their branches....
    In a very hidden mountain valley, a village was sound asleep. We went to knock on every board door, but only empty echoes resounded; we went to tap on every small window, but no one opened the small window, only thick ice condensed....
    In the top small window, a dim酥油 lamp suddenly lit up, but then went out immediately. We vaguely saw two withered lips, a pair of eyes covered with wrinkles, and a few wisps of slightly fluttering white hair.... That's it, it seems that tonight we can only sleep together with the wind that has not found a place to camp, and with the snow that is locked out....
    Ah! Our nostrils are covered with ice chips, our teeth are chattering like woodpeckers, our feet are stiff like wooden stakes growing on the ground, we really can't bear it anymore. We said: "Hey! Let's go to the mountain to find some firewood and make a fire!"
    We ran far away and broke off a few branches from the frozen dead trees; we dug out a few broken tree trunks from under the deep snow layer.... When we carried these firewood back, everyone was sweating profusely, and a缕缕 of dawn began to flash on the sweat—ah! We are already warm, and it is almost dawn. Ha! What do we still need this firewood for? We might as well leave it to this old lady!
    When the sun illuminated the entire mountain wilderness, illuminated all the roofs, the old lady巍巍颤颤 opened the door. We carried all the firewood and stepped into her small courtyard, piling it up against her courtyard wall. Then, we patted our muddy hands and said goodbye to her.... This surprised the lonely old lady so much that she didn't know what to do. In her life, who had ever given her such a warm smile? Who had ever picked up so much firewood for her for no reason?—And these people were the ones who had been locked out by her with a thick door闩 last night....
    The old lady trembled her dry, wrinkled lips, the old lady shed tears of gratitude. She pulled us one by one, pulled us into the low house on the wooden ladder. She busily blew the sparks under the stove, pressed the sheepskin bellows, cooked a piece of dried beef leg until it was rotten, and烙起一张张烫手的青稞饼.... A real warm current flowed into the body and mind of each of us.

    草原上·暖流
    ——写在边疆的散记
    顾工	草原上
    走出了总被绿叶遮盖着眼睛的森林，眼前便展现出一片蓝天，一片绿地，向前伸展，向前伸展，一直伸展到绿和蓝的交溶处……多么辽阔的美啊！多么单纯的美！
    草原上的野花啊！包围着我，拂揉着我，拥抱着我……它们从千万张小口中，吐出了千万缕芳香；它们用千万张小脸，作出了千万种表情：有的娇羞，有的顽皮，有的忸怩，有的大胆；有的像是一串串编缀起来的珍珠，有的像一团团结扎起来的彩绸……。
    有几个放羊的藏族孩子，在采摘着一把一把的花束，当我走过的时候，他们把花束抛在我的帽子上，我的马匹上……。我拉住一个骑在羊背上的孩子，我问他的名字，他却拉着我的衣袖反问：
    “你是修路的人吗？”
    “是啊！”
    “你是军人吗？”
    “是啊！是啊！”
    孩子们更加活跃起来了，他们争着把自己的名字告诉我：“我叫扎娃”——骑在羊背上的孩子，从羊背上跳下来，很精神地说：“我叫尼……尼玛”——这个小女孩嘴里嚼着一颗才采的口蘑，所以没有说太清；“我叫卓玛”——这个小女孩说完就捂起自己的脸，藏到别人的背后去了……。
    孩子们围着我旋绕，孩子们围着我喧笑。他们惊讶地望着我的手表，他们诧异地拔出我的钢笔，他们新奇地拉开我小皮包上的拉链……。突然，本来骑在羊背上的孩子非常严肃，非常关心地问我：
    “你见到过铁的牦牛吗？”
    “是汽车吧？”
    “不，不是”
    “是拖拉机吗？”
    “喔！喔！会翻地的……”
    “见过，我想你们将来也会在这片草原上见到它的……”
    我本来还想接着说：将来恐怕还要由你们来驾驶呢？但我又怕孩子们一时还理解不了；但孩子们没等我说出来，似乎就已经完全理解了。他们都默不作声地安静下来，只把渴待的希冀的眼神，移向远方，移向远远的东面……。
          暖　流
    在一个月亮都冻得惨白的深夜，我们翻过了一座座银亮的山峰，偶尔遇到几株雪松，它们也在瑟瑟发抖呢！抖落着堆满枝头的雪片……
    在非常隐蔽的山坳里，有个村庄正在沉沉入睡。我们过去敲了敲每扇板门，但只响起空空洞洞的回声；我们过去叩了叩每扇小窗，但小窗也没有人拉开，只凝结着厚厚的冰冻……。
    在最上面的一扇小窗里，突然有盏昏黄的酥油灯亮了一下，但又立即熄灭。我们模模糊糊地看见了两片干瘪的嘴唇，一对布满皱纹的眼，几丝微微拂动的白发……。完了，看来今夜我们只能陪伴着没有找到宿营地的风，陪伴着被关在门外的雪，在一起入睡了……。
    啊！我们的鼻孔都结上冰屑了，我们的牙像啄木鸟似地打着抖，我们的脚僵硬得像是长在地上的木桩，我们实在忍不住了。我们说：“喂！还是到山上去找点木柴，弄个火堆来吧！”
    我们跑出去很远，从冻死的枯树上折下几根枝桠；从深深的雪层下，挖出了几截折断的树干……。当我们扛着这些柴禾回来时，每个人都冒着热腾腾的汗珠，而在汗珠上开始闪现出一缕缕的晨光——啊！身上已经暖和了，天也快亮了。哈！我们还要这些柴禾作什么？干脆，就留给这家老太太吧！
    当阳光照亮了整个的山野，照亮了所有的屋顶的时候，那位老太太才巍巍颤颤地开开了门，我们就扛着所有的柴禾，跨进了她的小院，堆满了她的院墙。然后，我们拍了拍泥污的手，向她辞别了……。这下，可把这位孤独的老太太，弄得目瞪口呆，不知道怎么办才好，在她这一生中，谁对她发出过这样亲热的微笑呢？谁又平白无故地给她拾过这么多柴禾呢？——而这些人，又正是昨夜被她用根粗大的门栓关在门外的……。
    老太太颤着干皱的唇，老太太淌着感动的泪，她把我们一个一个拉住，拉到木梯上的那间矮房子里。她忙碌地吹亮了灶下的火星，按响了羊皮的风箱，煮烂了一块风干的牛腿，烙起了一张张烫手的青稞饼……。一股真正的暖流，流进了我们每一个人的身心。
