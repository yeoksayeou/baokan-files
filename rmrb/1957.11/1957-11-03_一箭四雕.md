    Killing Four Birds with One Arrow

      “I thought the 'blooming and contending' was only for the masses to criticize the cadres; I didn’t realize it was also to solve some ideological problems of the commune members…”
    “I was all ready to ‘bloom and contend’ against those troublemakers. I've had enough of their antics from spring to summer! I didn’t know commune members also had to offer opinions to the cadres…”
    “After the previous period of counterattacking anti-socialist elements in our area, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements don't dare to stir. Righteousness has already overcome evil. We all know who the bad guys are, so it’s not a big deal whether we have a full-scale blooming and contending or not…”
    “The grain problem has been largely solved, so what’s there to debate?…”
    Such remarks are often heard among rural cadres. Many still do not have a comprehensive understanding of the purpose of carrying out the nationwide rectification movement in the countryside. Generally speaking, it is relatively clear that the aim is to use the methods of great blooming, great contending, and great debate to attack activities that undermine the socialist cause and to discredit capitalist ideology among the masses. But less attention is paid to raising the level of awareness of the broad masses, and even less attention is paid to rectifying the work style of cadres and improving various tasks. Some rural cadres also say to the masses: "Welcome to offer opinions on the cadres and the work of the commune, etc.," but they only mention it lightly. Some cadres do not take it seriously when the masses offer some opinions on the cadres and the work, and do not express their attitude. They are only interested in "letting the monsters and demons come out." Some cadres become resentful when they hear opinions criticizing the cadres, and even threaten those who offer opinions behind their backs: "We'll settle the score after the work team leaves!"
    In places where this situation occurs, it is naturally more difficult for the masses to have a comprehensive understanding of the purpose of the movement. Many people are unsure and dare not speak out. At the debate meetings, the speakers often begin by confessing that they had capitalist ideas in the past, did not work hard, and expressed that they would take the commune as their home and obey the leadership in the future. Those who had previously agitated to withdraw from the commune or had caused trouble over "grain shortages" were even more likely to sit silently and passively awaiting "being straightened out" whenever a meeting started.
    This situation is particularly common in places where anti-socialist forces were first counterattacked by means of frontal criticism and named struggles before launching this round of great debate.
    In places where this situation has occurred, if we want to open up the situation and truly launch a great blooming, great contending, and great debate, first of all, we must make the guiding ideology of cadres at all levels leading the rural rectification movement, from the county party committee to the work teams, further clarified. We must conscientiously study the relevant documents of the Central Committee, especially the recently published report of Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the Third Plenary Session. (This report clearly points out the nature and purpose of the rural rectification movement.) We must always remember that the rural rectification has four purposes, none of which can be ambiguous and none of which can be omitted; one arrow must hit four birds, and it is not a complete victory if any one of them is missed. Once the guiding ideology is clear, we must explain the nature and purpose of this movement to the grassroots cadres, party members, and the masses in clear language and with a firm attitude, clearing away the different ideological obstacles of the grassroots cadres and some of the masses. We must hand over the Party's policies and guidelines to the broad masses so that the masses can fully understand them. At the same time, we must resolutely support the masses in speaking out freely. It is of little use to shout a few words like "Speak up!" "Speak up!" "Say whatever you want, don't have any worries!" in group meetings. We must clearly explain to the masses that they will never be labeled as "rightists," and resolutely guarantee that no one will be allowed to retaliate. In addition, we must study the specific ideological problems of some people who have particular concerns and do more individual conversations and field chats. In individual places where incidents of beating and tying people occurred in the past during the counterattack against anti-socialist forces, we must earnestly deal with them. Otherwise, it will not only be detrimental to the development of the movement in this village, but also hinder the development of the movement in many nearby places. Of course, it is even more important to rectify and reform simultaneously. We must seriously handle some of the opinions that the masses have initially raised, even if they are very small and fragmented, and there must be no coldness whatsoever. You must know that in this situation, coldness is equivalent to suppression.

    一箭四雕
    燕凌
      “我以为鸣放光是要群众批评干部哩，原来也要解决一些社员的思想问题……”
    “我早准备好了要‘鸣放’那些挑皮捣蛋的家伙，从春到夏受他们的气真受够了！不知道还要社员给干部提意见……”
    “我们这里经过前一个时期反击反社会主义分子，地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子都不敢活动了，正气已经压倒邪气了，谁是坏人我们都知道，不大鸣大放也不要紧了……”
    “粮食问题已经大体上解决了，还辩个什么呢？……”
    在农村干部中间，时常可以听到这样一类的话。不少人至今对于在农村开展全民性整风运动的目的，仍然没有全面地了解。一般地说，对于要通过大鸣大放大争反击破坏社会主义事业的活动，把资本主义思想在群众中搞臭，是比较明确的；对于提高广大群众的觉悟水平，就注意得比较差；对于整顿干部作风、改进各项工作，就注意得更差。有些农村干部也向群众讲：欢迎对干部、对社里的工作等等提意见，但只是轻轻淡淡地提一下。群众对干部对工作提了一些意见，有些干部不以为意，不表示态度，只对“放出牛鬼蛇神来”有兴趣。也有些干部一听到批评干部的意见就反感，甚至背地威胁提意见的人：“等工作组走了咱再算账！”
    在发生这种情况的地方，群众自然更难对运动的目的有全面的了解。许多人摸不着底，不敢发言。在辩论会上，发言的人往往是先检讨自己过去有资本主义思想，不好好劳动，表示今后要以社为家，服从领导。过去闹过退社、闹过“缺粮”的人，更是一开会就支着架子等待“挨整”，默默不语。
    特别是在这次开展大辩论之前先用正面批判、点名斗争的方式反击了反社会主义势力的地方，这种情况比较普遍。
    发生了这种情况的地方，要想把局面打开，要想真正开展大鸣大放大争，首先要使领导农村整风运动的各级干部，从县委到工作组，都进一步把领导思想明确起来。要认真学习中央有关的文件，特别是最近发表的邓小平同志在三中全会上的报告。（这个报告中，有一部分明确地指出了农村整风运动的性质和目的。）要时时刻刻记牢：农村整风的目的有四，一点也不能含糊，一个也不可漏掉；一支箭要射中四只雕，丢掉了任何一只，就不算全胜。领导思想明确了，还要以明确的语句，坚定的态度向基层干部、党员和群众把这次运动的性质和目的讲个明白，扫清基层干部和一些群众的各不相同的思想障碍。一定要把党的政策和方针交给广大群众，让群众完全了解。同时，坚决支持群众大鸣大放。光在小组会上喊几句“说呀！”“说呀！”“有什么说什么，不要有顾虑呀！”是没有什么用处的。要对群众明确地说明决不给戴“右派帽子”，坚决地保证不许任何人打击报复。此外，还要研究一些特别有顾虑的人的具体思想问题，多做一些个别交谈、地头谈心的工作。个别地方过去在反击反社会主义势力的时候曾经发生过打人绑人的事情，更要切实加以处理。不然，不但不利于本村运动的开展，还会有碍于附近许多地方运动的开展。当然，更重要的是边整边改，群众初步提出的一些意见，那怕很小很零碎也要认真处理，决不能有丝毫的冷淡。要知道，在这情况下，冷淡就等于压制。
