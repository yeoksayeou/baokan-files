Fertilizer is grain. Without fertilizer, it is impossible to increase the yield per unit area of crops. Chinese farmers have a long history and rich experience in using fertilizer in agricultural production. As early as the Shang Dynasty (more than 1700 years ago), the "Jiaojia Shu" summarized the experience of building pigsties and toilets, "teaching the people to use manure for planting." Later, Mencius also said that "those who use a lot of manure and work diligently are the best farmers," which shows that Chinese farmers have long known the importance of accumulating and applying fertilizer. The Soviet soil scientist Williams pointed out that "only when all the conditions of plant life (water, nutrition) are always supplied in the highest amount can the plant exert its full work and provide the highest work efficiency." According to scientific tests, there are 20 to 30 kinds of nutrient elements supplied to plants, among which nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and organic matter are more important. (Increasing the application of lime in acidic soil is also very important.) In particular, nitrogen fertilizer is the most valuable nutrient for plants. Without it, plants cannot grow strong and improve yield and quality. According to the results of soil surveys in various places, the most lacking in our country's soil is nitrogen fertilizer and organic matter. Therefore, in addition to mobilizing the masses to carry out large-scale accumulation of fertilizer and increase the application of natural fertilizers rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and organic matter, the state should also vigorously produce chemical fertilizers, continue to promote rhizobium inoculation, and carry out experiments on other bacterial fertilizers to ensure high and stable harvests.

Since liberation, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have attached great importance to fertilizer work. In 1957, the general fertilizer application level increased by one to two times compared with 1949. In many high-yield areas, it has exceeded 10,000 catties per mu. The unit area yield of grain crops nationwide has also increased by more than 43% compared with 1949; the unit area yield of cotton has increased by more than 76%. In 1953, many lands in the Hongguang Cooperative of Dazhai Township, Zunhua County, Hebei Province, did not apply fertilizer, and the land that was fertilized was at most 2,000 catties per mu, with an average yield of 160 catties per mu; in 1956, 5,000 catties of fertilizer were applied per mu, with a yield of 329 catties per mu; in 1957, 8,000 catties of fertilizer were applied per mu, with a yield of 400 catties per mu. The higher the yield per unit area, the more fertilizer is needed.

To achieve the production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, how much fertilizer is needed? Is there that much fertilizer? How to carry out the fertilizer accumulation campaign? How to achieve economical fertilizer use and rational fertilization? What issues should be paid attention to when increasing fertilizer application? These are all issues of great concern to everyone, and I will briefly explain them below:

I

According to scientific analysis, the production of 400 catties of wheat requires about 12 catties of nitrogen, 4 catties of phosphorus, and 10 catties of potassium, which is roughly equivalent to 6,000 catties of good quality stable manure; the production of 800 catties of rice requires about 20 catties of nitrogen, 10 catties of phosphorus, and 25 catties of potassium, which is roughly equivalent to 9,600 catties of good quality stable manure. From the analysis of large-area high-yield experience, it is entirely possible to guarantee the fertilizer needed to achieve the production increase targets proposed by the National Agricultural Development Program. For example, in 1956, Meng County, Henan Province, launched a campaign to accumulate 1,000 carts and 10,000 dan of fertilizer, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu reached about 10,000 catties. In 1957, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of paddy field in Hongan County, Hubei Province, reached 200 dan, and dry land reached 80 dan. They all achieved the production increase targets of 400 catties and 800 catties ahead of schedule. The main source of fertilizer still relies on the masses, using local materials and tapping fertilizer sources, and the proportion of chemical fertilizer used is very small. To ensure the nationwide realization of the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, grain should be increased to 400 catties, 500 catties, and 800 catties respectively, and cotton should be increased to 40 catties, 60 catties, 80 catties, and 100 catties respectively. All localities should formulate local annual goals for improving fertilizer application levels according to the fertilizer needs of farmland and fertilizer source conditions.

II

Although Chinese farmers have a long history of using natural fertilizers, and the technology of accumulating, preserving, and applying fertilizer has greatly improved since liberation, the fertilizer application level across the country is still extremely unbalanced. It is roughly estimated that less than 60% of the country raises pigs and builds pigsties to accumulate fertilizer, and some areas have only launched seasonal fertilizer accumulation campaigns and have not persisted in year-round fertilizer accumulation. To ensure the continuous improvement of fertilizer application levels, it is necessary to earnestly learn from the experience of Liling, Hunan, and carry out year-round fertilizer accumulation campaigns with "four diligences and eight haves." The most important issue in the current fertilizer accumulation work is to take effective measures to vigorously build pigsties and toilets and save fertilizer. Human and animal manure is the most valuable fertilizer. If a person's manure is lost, 100 to 150 catties of grain will be produced less; if a pig's manure is lost, 200 to 300 catties of grain will be produced less; if a large animal's manure is lost, 500 to 900 catties of grain will be produced less. In areas where people have no toilets, pigs have no sties, and cattle have no pens, or where fertilizer accumulation and preservation are not good, it is necessary to widely carry out propaganda and mobilization, use typical examples and comparative accounting methods, and mobilize the masses to build pigsties and toilets and strengthen fertilizer accumulation and preservation. Some specific difficulties still need to be vigorously helped to solve. Some places lack materials for building pigsties and toilets, and agricultural cooperatives need to organize forces, use local materials, and provide assistance. At the same time, it is also necessary to promote the advanced experience of fertilizer accumulation and preservation in various places, reasonably stipulate fertilizer accumulation work points and purchase prices, and reward fertilizer accumulation and preservation models to encourage the enthusiasm of cooperative members in accumulating fertilizer from various aspects. Fertilizer prices should vary according to the type, quantity, quality, and difficulty of accumulating fertilizer. As for whether to use all cash; or part cash; or account recording methods, specific arrangements should be made according to the economic situation of the agricultural cooperative, as long as the price is reasonable and guaranteed to be honored, the fertilizer accumulation work can be carried out smoothly. Secondly, it is necessary to develop green manure in a planned way and increase the yield per unit area of green manure. The current green manure area in the country is 48 million mu, and it is planned to develop to more than 100 million mu by 1962. The yield per unit area is required to increase from the current national average of about 1,500 catties per mu to about 3,000 catties per mu (the old areas average 4,000 catties per mu, and the new areas average 2,000 catties per mu). This is the best way to solve fertilizer and cultivate land fertility. According to scientific analysis, 1,000 catties of green manure contain 4 to 5 catties of nitrogen. If the average grass yield per mu is calculated at 3,000 catties, planting 100 million mu of green manure is equivalent to producing 3 million tons of ammonium sulfate. It can be seen how important the development of green manure is to agricultural production. Thirdly, according to the agricultural season, carry out a variety of fertilizer accumulation activities, and fully tap local fertilizer sources, such as cutting grass for composting, collecting mountain green, collecting lake grass, and seaweed; utilizing peat, marine products, and urban miscellaneous fertilizer; digging river mud, pond mud, and dismantling old wall soil, kang soil, etc. Some places believe that these fertilizers are not effective and cannot solve major problems, which is not right. According to scientific analysis: grass compost contains 0.2% to 0.4% nitrogen, 1% to 2% phosphorus, and 4% to 8% potassium; river mud and pond mud contain 0.1% to 0.4% nitrogen, 1% phosphorus, and 1% to 2% potassium.

Some people also believe that the fertilizer power of changing kang fertilizer every year is not great. In fact, as long as it is a kang for burning fire, it is also very good to change it once a year. In 1957, the Qunhe Cooperative in Xishui County, Hubei Province, had 1.72 mu of rice, yielding more than 1,700 catties per mu. In addition to the general agricultural measures being better, the most prominent experience was the use of a large amount of old wall soil. Of course, these fertilizers have a lower content of effective ingredients than human and animal manure. However, in rural areas, the source of these fertilizers is very large, and accumulating a little can have a great effect on agricultural production increase.

III

Promote the advanced experience of economical fertilizer use and rational fertilization. Due to the continuous increase in the demand for crop yields, the fertilizer supply is often felt to be insufficient. Therefore, people pay great attention to economical fertilizer use and rational fertilization in order to obtain the maximum yield increase effect with the least amount of fertilizer. There are many experiences in economical fertilizer use among Chinese farmers, such as adopting hole fertilization and strip fertilization methods; using ammonium sulfate as seed fertilizer for dry land wheat; and rice dipping seedling roots, etc. Experiments have proved that the combination of organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer as base fertilizer has a good effect. The Soviet mixed fertilization method is also a good way to use fertilizer economically. Some areas have iron, aluminum, and calcium in the soil, and the application of powdered superphosphate is easily fixed by the soil and loses its effectiveness. The use of granular phosphate fertilizer can improve fertilizer efficiency and has a significant yield increase effect, but agricultural cooperatives should use organic materials to make granular fertilizer for self-use. Some crops, such as cotton and sugar cane, also have a certain effect when phosphorus is sprayed outside the roots.

According to the needs of crop growth and development, timely and appropriate rational fertilization is an important guarantee for obtaining high yields. According to scientific experiments and the high-yield experience of farmers, various crops must be applied with sufficient base fertilizer and timely top dressing. For example, double-cropping rice, early rice, base fertilizer should be sufficient, and it should be combined with fast-acting fertilizer. Because early rice is sown and transplanted early, and the season is advanced, the temperature is low at that time, and some slow-acting fertilizers are not easily decomposed and absorbed and utilized by crops. Fast-acting fertilizer must be added to the base fertilizer to promote early tillering and early growth of early rice. Similarly, in order to make double-cropping late rice develop early and grow vigorously in high temperature, fast-acting fertilizer should also be added to the base fertilizer. Because the growth period of late rice is relatively long, fertilization should be applied in stages at the tillering, rounding, and booting stages. Local experience has proved that the application of ear fertilizer in top dressing has the greatest yield increase effect. According to the experiment on the effect of fertilizer on crop growth and development conducted by Mr. Bao Wenkui and Yan Yuduan, on the basis of applying an appropriate amount of base fertilizer, the use of top dressing during the jointing stage can not only increase the effective tillering rate of rice, but also increase the size of the panicles. It can also effectively increase the topping rate of wheat tillers. If nitrogen fertilizer can be applied again during the heading stage, the empty shell rate of rice can be reduced, and the quality of wheat seeds can be significantly improved.

Various factors of agricultural production increase are interconnected, interact, and play a comprehensive role. Increasing fertilizer application must adopt a series of advanced agricultural technologies. If a large amount of fertilizer is used, high-yielding, fertilizer-resistant, and lodging-resistant varieties must be used. At the same time, attention must also be paid to irrigation so that the soil has sufficient water to facilitate the decomposition of fertilizer and meet the needs of crop growth. For example, the Hongxing No. 1 Cooperative in Junan County, Shandong Province, in the past implemented local planting, timely cultivation, the use of improved varieties, reasonable close planting, and increased planting of high-yield crops and other production increase measures. These measures were very important, but due to the lack of water and fertilizer, the production increase effect could not be fully exerted, and the production was very unstable. Later, it prominently grasped the three basic links of water conservancy construction, pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, and soil improvement, and closely combined them with cultivation technology. In 1957, the yield per mu reached 527.5 catties, exceeding 266% before the establishment of the cooperative. The poor situation of "barren land and poor people" has been basically changed. The per capita income level has greatly exceeded that of the local wealthy middle peasants.

    大力积肥　合理施肥　提高产量
    农业部粮食生产总局局长　王志民
    “肥料就是粮食”，没有肥料就不可能提高农作物的单位面积产量。我国农民在农业生产上使用肥料的历史是很久的，经验也是很丰富的。早在公元前一千七百多年前商代“教稼书”即总结了修圈修厕的经验，“教民粪种”。后来孟子也说过“粪多而力勤者为上农”，可见我国农民早已知道积肥施肥的重要了。苏联土壤学家威廉士指出“只有在当植物生活的一切条件（水分、营养）都永远以最高量供应着的时候，植物才能发挥完全的工作，才能够提供最高的工作效率”。根据科学家测验供给植物的营养元素有二、三十种，其中以氮、磷、钾和有机质较为重要。（在酸性土壤增施石灰也很重要）尤其是氮素肥料是植物最贵重的一种营养素，没有它就不能使植物生长健壮，提高产量和品质。根据各地土壤调查结果知道我国土壤中最缺乏的也是氮肥和有机质。因此除了发动群众开展大规模的积肥、增施含氮、磷、钾和有机质比较丰富的自然肥料外；国家还要大力生产化学肥料，继续推广根瘤菌接种和开展其他细菌肥料的试验工作。以保证获得高额而稳定的丰收。
    解放以后，中国共产党和人民政府非常重视肥料工作，1957年一般施肥水平比1949年提高了一倍到二倍，不少丰产地区已超过万斤以上，全国粮食作物的单位面积产量也较1949年提高了43％以上；棉花单位面积产量提高76％以上，河北省遵化县大寨乡红光社1953年还有很多土地不施肥，而施肥的土地最多每亩二千斤，每亩平均产量一百六十斤；1956年每亩施肥五千斤，亩产三百二十九斤；1957年每亩施肥八千斤，亩产四百斤。单位面积产量愈高、需要使用肥料的数量也愈多。
    要实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的增产指标，究竟需要多少肥料？有没有那么多肥？怎样开展积肥运动？怎样做到经济用肥合理施肥？增施肥料需要注意那些问题？这些都是大家很关心的，现在简要说明如下：
    一
    根据科学分析，生产四百斤小麦约需氮素十二斤，磷素四斤，钾素十斤，大致相当于六千斤质量较好的厩肥；生产八百斤稻谷约需氮素二十斤，磷素十斤，钾素二十五斤，大致相当于质量较好的厩肥九千六百斤。从大面积丰产经验分析要保证实现全国农业发展纲要所提出的增产指标所需要的肥料是完全可能的。譬如河南孟县1956年开展千车万担积肥运动，每亩施肥量达到一万斤左右，1957年湖北红安县水田每亩施肥量达二百担、旱地达八十担，他们都提前实现了四百斤和八百斤的增产指标。肥料来源主要的还是依靠群众，就地取材，挖掘肥源，化学肥料使用的比重是很少的。为保证在全国范围内实现全国农业发展纲要规定，粮食分别提高到四百斤、五百斤、八百斤和棉花分别提高到四十斤、六十斤、八十斤、一百斤的增产指标。各地应该按照农田需肥情况和肥源条件，订出当地逐年提高施肥水平的目标。
    二
    我国农民使用自然肥料的历史虽然很久，解放以后积肥、保肥，施肥技术虽有很大提高，但从全国施肥水平来看各个地区之间还是极不平衡的，粗略估计全国养猪修圈积肥的不到60％，有些地区只开展了季节性积肥运动，没有坚持常年积肥。要保证施肥水平不断提高，必须认真学习湖南醴陵经验，开展四勤八有常年积肥运动。当前在积肥工作中最主要的问题，首先就要采取有效措施大力进行修圈建厕和攒肥料，人畜粪尿是最贵重的肥料，如果损失一个人的粪尿，就要少生产一百至一百五十斤粮食；如果损失一口猪的粪尿就要少产二百至三百斤粮食，如果损失一个大牲口的粪尿就要少产五百至九百斤粮食。在人无厕所、猪无圈、牛无栏的地区，或者积肥保肥不好的地区要普遍进行宣传动员，用典型事例和对比算账等方法，发动群众修圈修厕，加强积肥保肥工作。有些具体困难还需要大力帮助解决。有些地方缺乏修圈建厕的材料，就需要由农业合作社组织力量，就地取材，加以帮助。同时还要推广各地积肥保肥的先进经验，合理的规定积肥工分和收购价格，奖励积肥、保肥模范，从多方面鼓励社员积肥的积极性。肥料价格要根据肥料种类、数量、质量及积肥难易而有不同，至于全用现款；或部分用现款；或记账的办法要根据农业合作社经济情况具体安排，只要价格合理，保证兑现，积肥工作就可顺利开展。其次要有计划的发展绿肥，提高绿肥单位面积产量，现在全国绿肥面积四千八百万亩，计划到1962年发展到一亿亩以上，单位面积的产量要求从现在全国平均每亩一千五百斤左右提高到三千斤左右（老区平均每亩达四千斤，新区平均每亩达二千斤），这是解决肥料、培养地力一个最好的方法。根据科学分析，一千斤绿肥含氮素四到五斤，如果平均每亩产草量按三千斤计算，种一亿亩绿肥就等于生产三百万吨硫酸铵。可见发展绿肥对农业生产是多么重要了。再次，根据农业季节开展多种多样积肥活动，充分挖掘地方肥源，譬如割草沤肥、打山青、打湖草、海草；利用草炭，海产及城市杂肥；挖河泥，塘泥，拆换老墙土，炕土等等。有些地方认为这些肥料都是不顶事，解决不了大问题，这是不对的。根据科学分析：割草沤肥含氮千分之二到四，磷一到二，钾四到八；河泥、塘泥含氮千分之一到四，磷一，钾一到二。
    还有些人认为年年换炕肥力不大。其实只要是烧火的炕每年换一次也是很好的。湖北省浠水县群和社1957年有一点七二亩水稻，每亩收获一千七百多斤，除了一般农业措施较好外，最突出的一条经验就是用了大量旧墙土。当然这些肥料从有效成分看比人畜粪尿含量是低的。但是在农村里这些肥料来源数量很大，积少成多对农业增产就有很大的作用。
    三
    推广经济用肥、合理施肥的先进经验。由于对农作物产量要求不断提高，肥料供给就常常感到不足，因此人们都很注意经济用肥和合理施肥，以便用最少量的肥料获致最大的增产效果。在我国农民中有很多经济用肥的经验如采用穴施肥和条施肥的方法；旱地小麦用硫酸铵作种肥；水稻沾秧根等等。试验证明有机肥料和无机肥料混合作基肥效果良好，苏联的混合施肥法，也是一个经济用肥的好办法。有些地区土壤中含有铁、铝及钙，施用粉状过磷酸钙容易被土壤固定，失去效用。采用颗粒状磷肥可以提高肥效，有显著增产作用，但制造颗粒肥料应由农业社采用有机物质自制自用。有些作物如棉花、甘蔗，根外喷磷也有一定效果。
    按照农作物生长发育需要，适时适量合理施肥是获得高额丰产的重要保证。根据科学试验，和农民丰产经验证明，各种农作物都要施足基肥，适时追肥。如双季稻早稻基肥要足，并配合速效性肥料，由于早稻早播早插，季节提早，当时气温较低，对于一些迟效性肥料不易迅速分解被作物吸收利用，须在基肥中加施速效性肥料，促进早稻早分蘖，早生长，同样为了使双季晚稻在高温中及早发棵，生长繁茂，在基肥中也要加施速效性肥料，追肥因晚稻生长期较长，需在分蘖，圆杆，孕穗三个阶段分次施肥。各地经验证明，在追肥中施用穗肥增产效果最大，根据鲍文奎，严育端先生所作肥料对于作物生长和发育影响的试验证明，在适量施用基肥的基础上，使用拔节期追肥对水稻不但可以使有效分蘖率增高，而且还可以使穗子增大。对小麦也能有效的提高分蘖的上梢率，如果再能结合出穗期追施氮肥对水稻就能减少空壳率，对小麦就能显著增进种子的品质。
    农业增产的各种因素都是互相联系，互相影响综合发挥作用的。增施肥料必须采用一系列地先进的农业技术。如使用多量的肥料，必须采用丰产耐肥不倒伏的优良品种。同时还必须注意灌溉使土壤有充分的水分便于肥料分解，供给作物生长需要，如山东莒南县红星一社过去实行了因地种植，适时耕作，使用良种合理密植，增种高产作物等等增产措施，这些措施是十分重要的，但由于缺水，缺肥不能充分发挥增产作用，生产很不稳定，后来突出地抓住了兴修水利、养猪积肥，改良土壤等三个基本环节，并与耕作技术密切结合，1957年亩产达五百二十七斤半，超过建社前266％。基本改变了“地瘠民贫”的贫困状况。按人口平均收入水平大大地超过了当地富裕中农。
