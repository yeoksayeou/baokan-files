    "The Empty Seal Box" is a good play. It successfully portrays He Wenxiu, a righteous and selfless, young and capable character, who is also arrogant, conceited, careless.

    In the play, this character is shown through the story of being sent to Hangzhou to investigate the prefect who colludes with water bandits to harm the people. There is no fascinating plot twist, nor are there emotionally charged scenes that draw tears, but it can still make the audience concentrate and follow the development of the plot, sinking into the play step by step.

    The reason why this play produces such charm, in addition to the clever script and the concerted efforts of the stage staff, is the actor Wang Yongchun, who shaped the image of He Wenxiu. He has a good appearance, a pleasant voice, and more importantly, his performance is refined and profound. In the scene where he encounters the enemy in the boat, He Wenxiu, disguised, shows contempt for the enemy, impatience, and a blatant attitude, as well as the feeling of being utterly颓唐（despondent）,沮丧（dispirited）,焦急（anxious）, and惊怕（fearful）after losing the seal, all performed vividly and almost perfectly. The actor Zhang Yongjia, who plays the old servant, also has a steady and lovely acting skill. Shi Lianxiu, who plays Li Yueying, the wife of the water bandit, has a sweet and pleasant voice. The other actors are also good.

    This play not only allows the audience to appreciate the art of opera, but also will cause people to think deeply about He Wenxiu, a typical and realistic character. Starting from the evening of the 16th, this play will be performed at the Zhonghe Theater. This is one of the good plays presented to the capital audience by the Shijiazhuang Silk String Opera Troupe for the first time. (Wu) (Attached picture)

### 丝弦剧“空印盒”

    丝弦剧“空印盒”
    “空印盒”是一出好戏，它成功地刻划了一个正直无私、年轻能干却又骄傲自负、麻痹大意的人物——明末巡按何文秀。
    戏里，这个人物是通过被派前往杭州查办知府勾结水贼残害百姓的故事展示出来的。并没有引人入胜的曲折情节，也没有赚人热泪的激情场面，但它照样能使观众全神贯注、并且随着剧情的发展而亦步亦趋地沉进戏中。
    这出戏所以产生这种魅力，除了剧本编得巧妙和舞台工作人员的努力协作外，不能不专门提一提塑造了何文秀这一形象的演员王永春。他，扮相好看，嗓音好听，更其突出的是做功洗练深刻。在舟中遇到敌人的一场戏，乔妆改扮了的何文秀那种轻视敌人、沉不住气、锋芒毕露的情态，以及失印之后，他混身颓唐、沮丧、焦急、惊怕的神色，都表演得维妙维肖，几乎入了化境。饰演老仆的演员张永甲，演技也稳健可爱，饰演李月英——水贼之妻的石连秀，嗓音甜润动听。其他演员也都还好。
    这个戏不但能使观众得到戏曲艺术上的欣赏，而且会对何文秀这个典型而有现实意义的人物引起深思。从16日晚起，这个戏在中和戏院开始演出。这是首次来京的石家庄丝弦剧团首次呈现给首都观众的好戏中的一出。（吴）（附图片）
