Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 3rd: The rectification campaign in Hubei Province's directly subordinate organs has successively entered its third phase. Currently, the masses in various organs are enthusiastically engaging in "great blooming and letting contend," exposing various shortcomings and problems in their work. Each unit has organized dedicated personnel to synthesize and summarize various opinions, and these are then given to the masses for discussion to seek solutions.

Leadership's efforts to strengthen the masses' confidence in "great blooming and letting contend" is a characteristic of the rectification campaign in Hubei's provincial-level organs after entering the rectification and improvement phase. Leading cadres in various units are showing great determination to improve their work and correct shortcomings. They have adopted many measures to strengthen the masses' confidence in expressing their views. Big-character posters, discussion meetings, and "blooming and contending" meetings have been widely used. Units such as the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative put forward the slogan "Propose a batch, correct a batch," which was well received by the masses. Cadres from the Production Materials Department of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative raised thirty-six opinions at a discussion meeting, and the leadership seriously addressed seventeen of these opinions that could be dealt with immediately on the third day. The masses saw the leadership's determination. "Blooming and contending" quickly reached a climax. More than two hundred cadres posted more than one hundred and forty big-character posters in one afternoon, raising more than four hundred opinions on the department's policy issues related to serving production and consumers.

The lack of sincerity in accepting mass opinions in individual units has been criticized by higher-level leaders and the masses. Some leading personnel in the Provincial Forestry Bureau and Aquatic Products Bureau harbored the idea of fearing to "get burned," and they once regarded some well-intentioned criticisms from the masses as erroneous remarks, which once affected the masses' enthusiasm for expressing their views. The higher-level Party committee pointed out this erroneous attitude of the leaders of these two bureaus. Recently, these two bureaus re-ranked the masses' opinions and seriously improved their work, which reversed the situation.

Since the start of the rectification campaign this summer, the vast number of cadres in more than ninety units of Hubei's provincial-level organs have put forward more than forty thousand opinions on leadership style, business policies, and welfare, of which 33% have been resolved. The style of many leading cadres has been greatly improved. Directors of departments and bureaus such as Water Conservancy and Agriculture have adopted going deep into the grassroots as a basic working method.

    坚定群众对大鸣大放的信心
    湖北各机关认真处理各项意见
    据新华社武汉3日电　湖北省各直属机关的整风运动已经先后进入第三阶段。现在各机关群众踊跃大鸣大放，揭露工作中的各种缺点和问题，各单位都组织专人综合、归纳各种意见，并且交给群众讨论，寻求解决的方案。
    领导方面想尽办法坚定群众对大鸣大放的信心，是湖北省级机关整风运动进入整改阶段后的一个特色。各单位领导干部改进工作、改正缺点的决心很大，他们为了坚定群众鸣放信心，采取了很多措施。大字报、座谈会、鸣放会被广泛地利用起来。省供销合作社等单位提出了“提一批，改一批”的口号，深受群众欢迎。供销合作社生产资料处干部在一次座谈会上提了三十六条意见，第三天，领导上就把其中十七条能马上处理的意见认真作了处理。群众看到领导上的决心。鸣放很快形成高潮，二百多个干部一个下午就贴出了一百四十多张大字报，对这个处有关为生产、为消费者服务等方针政策性问题提出了四百多条意见。
    个别单位接受群众意见缺乏诚意，受到了上级领导和群众的批评。省林业局和水产局的部分领导人员有怕“惹火烧身”的思想，他们曾把群众提出的一些善意批评当作错误言论，一度使群众的鸣放积极性受到影响。上级党委指出了这两个局领导人员的这种错误态度，最近这两个局对群众的意见重新作了排队，认真改进工作，这才扭转了局面。
    自从今夏整风运动开始以来，湖北省级机关九十多个单位的广大干部已经就领导作风、业务政策、生活福利等方面提出了四万多条意见，其中有33％已经得到解决。许多领导干部的作风已有很大改进，水利、农业等厅、局长都以深入基层作为基本的工作方法。
