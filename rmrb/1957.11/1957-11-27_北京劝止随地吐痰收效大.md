    Beijing's Efforts to Discourage Spitting in Public Show Great Results
    (Our dispatch) Since the end of September, Beijing's campaign to discourage spitting in public has achieved significant results. In the past two months, the city's residents have generally received education on hygiene knowledge. According to statistics from November 10th, 2,990,000 people in the city received publicity and education. Now, the number of people spitting in public has greatly decreased. When the campaign first started, a survey on the sidewalk of Dongsi South Street showed that out of 194 people passing by the sidewalk in half an hour, 29 people spat on the ground. Twenty-five days later, in the same time period, out of 158 people passing by the sidewalk, only eight people spat on the ground. In the past, at the Chongwenmen Outer intersection, the phenomenon of people spitting on the ground while waiting for trains was very serious. After half a month of publicity and education, pedestrians waiting there rarely spat on the ground.
    In carrying out this campaign to discourage spitting in public, Beijing fully mobilized Red Cross members and middle and primary school students to participate in publicity activities. They used holidays and spare time to go to stations and other public places, using various methods such as shouting slogans, blackboards, big-character posters, banners, cartoons, leaflets, lectures, and broadcasting vehicles to carry out extensive publicity activities.
    The Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has now decided to continue publicity and education, and to carry out the campaign to discourage spitting in public more extensively and deeply, treating it as a regular task. (Zheng Youde)

    北京劝止随地吐痰收效大
    本报讯　北京市从9月底以来开展的劝止随地吐痰运动，获得了显著成绩。在两个月中，全市人民普遍受到了一次卫生知识的教育。据11月10日这一天的统计，全市就有二百九十九万人次受到宣传教育。现在，随地吐痰的人已大大减少。运动刚开始时，据在东四南大街便道上的调查，在半小时内通过便道的一百九十四人中，有二十九人随地吐了痰；二十五天后，在同时间内通过便道的一百五十八人中，只有八个人随地吐了痰。崇文门外路口过去每次过火车时，停留的人随地吐痰的现象很严重。经过半个月的宣传教育以后，停留的行人就很少随地吐痰。
    北京市在开展这次劝止随地吐痰运动中，充分发动红十字会会员和中、小学学生参加宣传活动。他们利用假日、课余时间，到车站及其他公共场所，通过喊话、黑板报、大字报、标语、漫画、传单、讲座、广播宣传车等各种方式，进行广泛的宣传活动。
    北京市爱国卫生运动委员会现确定，继续进行宣传教育，更广泛而深入地开展劝止随地吐痰运动，把它作为经常性的工作。（郑幼德）
