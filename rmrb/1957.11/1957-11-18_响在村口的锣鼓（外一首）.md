Gongs and Drums Resound at the Village Entrance

　　The National Day has just passed, and the New Year has yet to arrive.
　　Why are the deafening gongs and drums being struck loudly at the village entrance?
　　Is it to celebrate the fact that the millet has once again filled the granaries?
　　Is it to celebrate the fact that the cotton has once again filled the bales?
　　Is it to celebrate the fact that the water well has been dug?
　　Is it to celebrate the fact that the power station is generating electricity?
　　Ah, children dance, and old people smile,
　　It is the "old cadre" who has been away for many years who has returned!

　　Autumn plowing,
　　The plowshare is the needle,
　　The mud waves are the thread,
　　You are a wonderfully skilled weaver girl,
　　In just one short night,
　　You sewed the land north of the village into one piece.
　　You, the first generation of educated farmers,
　　You, the first generation of female tractor drivers,
　　Tell me, tell me:
　　This autumn, when you embroider water-like patterns here,
　　What bright petals will bloom next spring?

    响在村口的锣鼓（外一首）
    李学鳌国庆刚过去，新年还没到。震耳的锣鼓啊，为什么在村口高敲？是庆贺谷子又堆满仓？是庆贺棉花又装满包？是庆贺水井又挖好？是庆贺电站发电了？啊，孩子舞，老人笑，是阔别多年的“老干部”回来了！
    秋耕犁头是针，泥浪是线，你是巧夺天工的织女，在短短的一夜间，就把村北的土地缝成一片。你，第一代有文化的农民，你，第一代开拖拉机的女社员，告诉我，告诉我：今秋当你在这儿绣上水波似的花纹，明春将开出多么鲜艳的花瓣？
