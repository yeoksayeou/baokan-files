In Anhui Province, in the recent half-month struggle against drought and for wheat planting, over 110,000 cadres from Party, government, military organs, people's organizations, and universities and colleges went to the countryside in batches to help farmers plant wheat. Among the cadres who went to the countryside, in addition to ordinary cadres, all leading cadres who could be spared participated in this production movement, from responsible persons of the Provincial Party Committee and ministers, directors, bureau chiefs, and section chiefs of provincial-level organs, to responsible persons of prefectures, cities, and counties, and heads of military regions. The vast numbers of cadres helped farmers in production very conscientiously. The officers and soldiers of the military region worked more than nine hours a day, with speed and good quality. The commune members' general comment on the cadres' participation in production was: "Strong labor, good discipline, late to quit work, early to the fields." Cadres from provincial-level organs and officers and soldiers stationed in Hefei alone helped farmers plant wheat, sow rapeseed, peas, etc., on more than 8,000 mu, as well as a large amount of other farm work.

The cadres going to the countryside to help farmers in production powerfully promoted the fight against drought and the planting of wheat. For example, in the suburban area of Hefei City, statistics on October 8 showed that only more than 6,000 mu had been planted in the whole area. Some people went to the city to work as temporary laborers, and some waited for rain and did not plant. After a large number of cadres went to the countryside, more than 60,000 mu were planted in just ten days, accounting for 71% of the autumn planting area. The cadres who went to the countryside set an example, leading farmers to better abide by labor discipline, and encouraging grassroots cadres and young students to actively participate in labor. In many cooperatives, under the leadership of cadres who went to the countryside, men and women, young and old, worked day and night to rush planting. In Chaohu Cooperative in Feidong County, some production team leaders did not often participate in production, but now, under the leadership of cadres who went to the countryside, they also worked with everyone. In Aiqun Cooperative in Feidong County, there were three senior primary school graduates who had ideological problems with participating in agricultural production and had been staying at home without working; this time, seeing that even generals from the army came to work, they took the initiative to ask the cadres for work. Some grassroots cadres used to think that the higher authorities only called on them to participate in production, but this time, seeing that the leading cadres were all working conscientiously, they said: "This makes us convinced." Through participating in labor together, the relationship between the Party and the masses, the relationship between cadres and the masses, and the relationship between the army and the people have been further improved.

In view of the good results of this cadre's going to the countryside, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision at its recent Standing Committee meeting to stipulate the method of having on-the-job cadres go to the countryside in batches and in rotation to participate in production as a system, tentatively setting that every cadre should go to the countryside to participate in production for five days during the busy farming season. In addition, when cadres are in contact with agricultural cooperatives, they should also participate in labor production in a planned way.

    安徽大批干部帮助群众生产
    在劳动中和群众建立密切联系
    本报讯　在安徽省最近半个月的抗旱种麦斗争中，各级党、政、军机关、人民团体、大专学校分批下乡帮助农民种麦的干部达十一万多人。下乡的干部中除一般干部外，所有能抽出的领导干部，上自省委负责人及省级机关的部长、厅长、局长、处长，地、市、县的负责人及军区首长都参加了这次生产运动。广大干部帮助农民生产，十分认真。军区官兵每天干活达九小时以上，速度快，质量好。社员们对干部参加生产的总评语是：“劳动强，纪律好，收工迟，下地早”。单是省直属机关干部和驻合肥官兵就帮助农民种麦、点油菜、豌豆等八千多亩，还有大量其他农活。
    干部下乡帮助农民生产，有力地推动了抗旱种麦。如合肥市郊区，10月8日统计，全区只种六千多亩，有些人到城里作临时工，有些人等待天雨不种。等大批干部下乡以后，仅仅十天就种了六万多亩，占秋种面积的71％。下乡干部以身作则，带动农民更好地遵守劳动纪律，使基层干部和青年学生积极地参加劳动。有许多社在下乡干部带动下男女老少连夜抢种。肥东县巢湖社有些生产队长不经常参加生产，现在在下乡干部带动下，也和大家一起干活了。肥东爱群社有三个高小毕业生，对参加农业生产思想不通，一直呆在家里不劳动；这次，看到部队里的将军都来劳动，便主动向干部要活做。有些基层干部过去认为上级只号召他们参加生产，这次看到领导干部都在认真干活，他们说：“这使我们心服口服了”。在共同参加劳动中，党群关系、干群关系、军民关系都进一步改善。
    中共安徽省委鉴于这次干部下乡的成效很好，在最近的常委会上作了决定，把在职干部分批轮流下乡生产的办法规定为一项制度，暂定每逢农忙时节各个干部都要下乡生产五天。此外，在干部联系农业社时，也应有计划参加劳动生产。
