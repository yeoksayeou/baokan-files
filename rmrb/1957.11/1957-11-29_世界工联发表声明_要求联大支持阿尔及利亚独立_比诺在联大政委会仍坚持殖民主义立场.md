Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 28th - The World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement to the Twelfth United Nations General Assembly on the Algerian question on the 27th.

The statement said that people of all countries around the world point out that the attitude adopted by the French government so far has dispelled these hopes. Military actions against the Algerian people have increased human sacrifice and suffering. World public opinion indignantly condemns this attitude. The proposition to peacefully resolve the conflict according to the reasonable wishes of the Algerian people and in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter is gaining widespread support. Not long ago, the governments of Morocco and Tunisia expressed their willingness to mediate. The representatives of the Algerian people attach great importance to this initiative, which is conducive to restoring peace between France and Algeria. Now, only the French government insists on refusing to use negotiations to fairly and reasonably resolve the Algerian issue. Under these circumstances, the debate on the Algerian issue at the Twelfth United Nations General Assembly is of particular importance to the Algerian and French people, as well as to world peace.

The statement then said that the working people and trade unions of all countries around the world have responded to the call of the Fourth Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions and launched a movement to support the Algerian people. The World Federation of Trade Unions firmly hopes that the United Nations General Assembly will support the legitimate aspirations of the Algerian people for independence.

Xinhua News Agency, November 28th - New York News: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the Algerian issue on the 27th.

French Foreign Minister Pineau was the first to speak. He made no mention of the French colonialists' brutal suppression of the Algerian people, but instead touted the "fundamental law" that the French government was preparing to implement to reform Algerian politics. Pineau put forward a three-point plan for resolving the Algerian issue—ceasefire, elections, negotiations—but refused to grant Algeria independence, which is the national right of the Algerian people.

Pineau insisted that if Algeria were to exercise self-determination, Algeria would be divided into "two countries."

Pineau also slandered Egypt and Syria, insisting that they were hindering the resolution of the Algerian issue and should be held responsible for the situation in Algeria.

The representatives of Egypt and Syria refuted Pineau's accusations. Egyptian representative Lutfi said that Pineau's accusations against Egypt were deliberately fabricated rumors and lies, the purpose of which was to cover up France's refusal to grant the Algerian people the rights they deserve.

    世界工联发表声明
    要求联大支持阿尔及利亚独立
    比诺在联大政委会仍坚持殖民主义立场
    据新华社布拉格28日电　世界工会联合会27日就阿尔及利亚问题发表了致第十二届联合国大会的声明。
    声明说，全世界各国人民指出，法国政府直到目前为止所采取的态度驱散了这些希望。反对阿尔及利亚人民的军事行动增加了人类的牺牲和痛苦。世界舆论愤慨地谴责这种态度。要求根据阿尔及利亚人民的合理愿望，按照联合国宪章的原则和平解决冲突的主张，日益获得广泛的支持。不久以前，摩洛哥和突尼斯两国政府曾经表示愿意进行斡旋。阿尔及利亚人民的代表很重视这个有助于恢复法国和阿尔及利亚之间的和平的倡议。现在，只有法国政府坚持拒绝用谈判的方法公平、合理地解决阿尔及利亚问题。在这种种情况下，第十二届联合国大会关于阿尔及利亚问题的辩论，对阿尔及利亚人民和法国人民，以及对世界和平都具有特殊重要的意义。
    声明接着说，世界各国的劳动人民和各个工会响应世界工联第四次代表大会的呼吁，展开了支援阿尔及利亚人民的运动。世界工联坚决地希望，联合国大会能够支持阿尔及利亚人民要求独立的合理愿望。
    据新华社28日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会27日开始讨论阿尔及利亚问题。
    法国外交部长比诺第一个发言。他绝口不谈法国殖民主义者对阿尔及利亚人的残酷镇压，却一味吹嘘法国政府准备推行的所谓改革阿尔及利亚政治的“根本法”。比诺提出了解决阿尔及利亚问题的三点计划——停火、选举、谈判，但是拒绝给予阿尔及利亚以独立，而独立正是阿尔及利亚人的民族权利。
    比诺硬说，如果阿尔及利亚实行自决，阿尔及利亚就会分裂成“两个国家”。
    比诺还对埃及和叙利亚进行诬蔑，硬说它们妨碍阿尔及利亚问题的解决，要对阿尔及利亚局势负责。
    埃及和叙利亚的代表反驳了比诺的指责。埃及代表卢特菲说，比诺对埃及的指责是蓄意编造的谣言和谎话，其目的在于掩饰法国不肯给予阿尔及利亚人民以应有的权力。
