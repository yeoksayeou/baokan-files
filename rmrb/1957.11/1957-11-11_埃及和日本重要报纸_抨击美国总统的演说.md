Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 9th: "Al-Shaab" newspaper published a commentary on November 9th stating that Eisenhower's speech on the 7th revealed the United States' plan to expand its sphere of domination and place humanity in an increasingly grave danger. The newspaper said: "Eisenhower announced that American military bases could strike the Soviet Union with atomic weapons carried by intermediate-range rockets," thus, he revealed "the true purpose of the United States in establishing military alliances and bases abroad."

"Al-Shaab" said that Eisenhower's so-called sharing of secrets with U.S. allies was "rather a sharing of dangers," because "any country, if its government succumbs to the United States, then it will be subject to danger from the United States itself and from American bases."

The newspaper mentioned the suspicious activities currently being carried out by the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea to suppress the nationalist movement of the Jordanian people, and said: "This is one of the serious roles of military bases. For the sake of peace, military bases must be abolished."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 9th: News from Tokyo: Several major Japanese newspapers expressed dissatisfaction with U.S. President Eisenhower's speech. "Yomiuri Shimbun" published an editorial today saying that from Eisenhower's so-called speech on "the scientific problems in national security," "no positive opinions on peace can be seen."

"Yomiuri Shimbun" believes that Eisenhower's speech was a response to the appeal made by First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev. The editorial pointed out that Khrushchev, in his talk, advocated that capitalist countries and socialist countries hold high-level representative conferences in order to seek peaceful coexistence between the two camps, but Eisenhower actually responded by boasting and expressing that he would strengthen U.S. military power.

"Mainichi Shimbun," in commenting on Eisenhower's speech, said that the time has come for the United States to re-examine its "policy of strength."

    埃及和日本重要报纸
    抨击美国总统的演说
    据新华社开罗电　“人民报”11月9日发表评论说，艾森豪威尔7日发表的演说透露了美国想扩大统治地区和把人类置于日益严重的危险之下的计划。这家报纸说：“艾森豪威尔宣布，美国的军事基地能够以中程火箭所载有的原子武器打击苏联”，这样，他就透露了“美国在国外建立军事同盟和基地的真正目的”。
    “人民报”说，艾森豪威尔所谓的同美国的盟国分享秘密，“倒不如说是分享危险”，因为“任何国家，如果它的政府屈从美国，那末它就会受到来自美国本身和美国基地的危险”。
    这家报纸提到了目前美国第六舰队为了镇压约旦人民的民族主义运动而在地中海进行的形迹可疑的活动，并且说：“这就是军事基地的严重的作用之一。为了和平，必须废除军事基地。”
    据新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本几家大报对美国总统艾森豪威尔的演说表示不满。“读卖新闻”今天发表社论说，从艾森豪威尔发表的所谓“国家安全中的科学问题”的演说中“看不出对和平的积极意见”。
    “读卖新闻”认为艾森豪威尔的这番演说是对苏联共产党第一书记赫鲁晓夫发出的呼吁的回答。社论指出，赫鲁晓夫在谈话中提倡资本主义国家和社会主义国家举行高级代表会议以便谋求两个阵营间的和平共处，但是，艾森豪威尔竟以夸耀和表示将要加强美国军事力量来做为回答。
    “每日新闻”在评论艾森豪威尔演说时说，现在已经到了美国重新研究它的“实力政策”的时候了。
