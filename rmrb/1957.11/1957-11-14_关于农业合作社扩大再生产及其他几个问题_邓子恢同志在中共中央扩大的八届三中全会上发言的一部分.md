On Expanding Reproduction of Agricultural Production Cooperatives and Other Issues
— Part of Comrade Deng Zihui's Speech at the Enlarged Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China —

I. On the Continuous Expansion of Reproduction in Agricultural Production Cooperatives

In the future, the development of agricultural production will mainly rely on running agricultural production cooperatives well. Continuous expansion of reproduction is the basic key to developing agricultural production, striving to catch up with or exceed the production level of local upper-middle peasants in about five years, and truly consolidating the cooperatives. The National Rural Work Conference held in September this year focused on discussing this issue. Various regions exchanged experiences on this matter. Generally, there are the following issues:

First, the most fundamental aspect of expanding reproduction is expanding capital construction. The main contents are:

(1)  Carry out water conservancy projects according to local conditions, develop irrigation, reduce or eliminate water and drought disasters, and add corresponding water lifting and drainage tools. This is the lifeline to ensure the development of agricultural production.

(2)  Exploit fertilizer sources, increase fertilizer accumulation, and practice intensive cultivation.

(3)  On the basis of water conservancy construction and increased fertilizer accumulation, implement reforms in the farming system, such as changing dry land to paddy fields, single cropping to double cropping, and sloping land to terraced fields. These are effective measures for increasing agricultural production in various regions in recent years.

(4)  Develop towards the mountains, afforest and plant trees, and develop oil crops, fiber crops, and fruit trees. In this way, on the one hand, we can green the mountains and forests, conserve water and soil, conserve water sources, and regulate the climate. On the other hand, we can expand the long-term income of cooperatives.

(5)  The state should entrust the agricultural product processing industry to the cooperatives for operation as much as possible. In this way, on the one hand, the sideline income of the cooperatives can be increased, and oil cakes can be used as fertilizer and feed. On the other hand, the state can reduce the losses from long-distance transportation of raw materials and by-products. To this end, agricultural cooperatives should gradually purchase processing equipment and sideline equipment.

(6) Develop animal husbandry and corresponding capital construction. Agriculture and animal husbandry are two mutually supportive and interdependent and inseparable links.

(7) Improve agricultural tools and add necessary and suitable agricultural machinery.

(8) Develop and improve transportation and transportation tools.

Second, the source of funds for expanding reproduction: mainly rely on the cooperatives' self-reliance and the hard work of the members. The method is: gradually expand the public accumulation fund on the basis of ensuring that the income of the members increases year by year. We can consider modifying the relevant provisions of the cooperative's charter, and each region and cooperative can handle it according to the situation, exceeding the 5%-8% regulations. In bumper years, especially in economic crop areas, it can reach more than 12%. This can increase accumulation, reduce nouveau riche, avoid waste, and make up for the insufficiency of lean years. In addition, the state should allocate a certain proportion of funds in capital construction investment to invest in basic agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy construction, such as building necessary large- and medium-sized water conservancy projects, allocating certain afforestation funds, and establishing tractor stations and pumping stations to support agricultural and forestry production. This is an important factor in expanding reproduction and promoting faster development of agricultural and forestry production.

Third, mobilizing members to contribute appropriately more construction labor days is the basic way out for expanding reproduction. In some places, about 10% of the working days can be drawn from each member each year. If we calculate based on 200 million full laborers nationwide, 10 working days per person per year is 2 billion working days. If each person contributes 20 working days, it is 4 billion working days. This is a very huge force.

Whether construction labor is obligatory or distributed as dividends in the current year can be determined by each region as appropriate.

(1)  It is best to distribute dividends in the current year, which can better stimulate the labor enthusiasm of the members and avoid labor waste, but the assigned value should be lower, and the members should be clearly informed.

(2)  Cooperatives with high member awareness can record work points in the current year and distribute dividends when there is a return.

(3)  Afforestation can be contracted for three years, guaranteeing planting and survival, and labor costs will be paid when survival is achieved.

(4)  Completely obligatory work is also possible, but it must be carried out after full mobilization and organizational leadership to avoid labor waste.

Fourth, production management work must be done well so as to fully exert the labor enthusiasm of the members, which can not only increase the attendance rate and improve labor efficiency but also put auxiliary labor to use. Labor creates value. This is the basic key to doing a good job in current production and expanding capital construction. We have not done this work well in the past. In many places, labor efficiency is not high, and there is idleness and waste. Since last winter and this spring, various regions have created a production management system that is more suitable for the characteristics of decentralized agricultural production, field operations, and manual operations, that is, unified management, hierarchical management, clear division of labor, and individual responsibility system. The specific practices are as follows:

(1) Implement the three-guarantee system, that is, guaranteeing work, guaranteeing output, and guaranteeing finances. This is the best way to fix the relationship between the cooperative and the team. The cooperative entrusts the production team with the responsibility of managing land, draft animals, farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, etc. In terms of remuneration, how much work is done and how many work points are recorded, or is it a piece-rate system? In terms of crop harvest, how much is produced and how much is turned over, or is it a production quota system? In terms of financial expenditure, how much is used and how much is reimbursed, or is it a financial guarantee system? Obviously, the three-guarantee system has fewer drawbacks and fewer disputes, and therefore is a relatively progressive system.

(2) Implement two indicators: over-production reward and under-production deduction system. This further rationalizes the relationship between the team and the cooperative. In the past, various regions also had piece-rate and production quota systems, but the production quota and the planned quota were often one indicator. The members saw that the grasp of completing the planned quota was not great, and even if they could complete it, the over-production was not large, and the reward was not much, so the enthusiasm was often not high. Now it has been changed to two indicators. The planned indicator is slightly higher than the actual output, and the production quota is slightly lower than the actual output, so that the teams that are contracted for production have output to exceed and rewards to be made. This is an effective way to encourage the enthusiasm of the members. As long as the enthusiasm of the members is high and the output is exceeded, it is good for the members, the cooperative, and the country. This is beneficial and harmless. Of course, the production quota should not be too low. If there is no special reason and the production is reduced, it is also necessary to impose appropriate punishments.

(3) "Work contracted to the group, the group contracted to the area." This is a way to fix the relationship between the team and the group. The production team entrusts the group to manage a certain area of seasonal agricultural work. Is it better to adopt the old method of evaluating work and recording points, or is it better to contract the work by area and seasonal agricultural work? Obviously, the area-contracted work system is more progressive. This can avoid the problems of the captain "temporarily assigning work" and "temporarily dispatching troops," wasting time.

(4) "Field odd jobs contracted to households." This is one of the ways to fix the relationship between the group and the group members. In the past, work points were evaluated and recorded every day, which was both a waste of time and easy to cause disputes. Now it has been changed to "quota set according to the field, work contracted to households." The work points for general field odd jobs are all pre-evaluated and contracted to households. In this way, full labor, semi-labor, and auxiliary labor can be used. It can be done early or late, or during the day, and the work points can be obtained as long as the quantity and quality are guaranteed to be completed on time. This clear division of labor and individual responsibility can also avoid the phenomenon of rough cultivation.

(5) "Major work done collectively, minor work done separately." In the past, many cooperative cadres misunderstood collective labor, "ringing the bell to gather, going to the fields together," "working in a swarm," and the phenomenon of labor waste was very serious. This method can overcome it. Major agricultural work must be done collectively, and some work can be done separately by each household. Even the work done collectively must be divided into blocks, sections, and clear boundaries, and carried out separately from each other to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Now it seems that these management systems are suitable for the characteristics of current agricultural production. Most cooperatives across the country have implemented it, but some cooperatives have not implemented it or have not implemented it well. It is hoped that the party committees of various regions will vigorously promote it in accordance with the instructions of the central government and the conditions of various regions. This is the fundamental link to improve labor efficiency, exert the labor enthusiasm of the members, and do a good job in agricultural production and expanded reproduction.

Fifth, to expand reproduction, we must implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. Here, we must pay attention to:

(1) Greatly reduce the number of cadres who are divorced from production and reduce work point subsidies. We propose to change the 1.5%-2% provisions of the cooperative's charter to no more than 1%. Judging from the current situation, this is completely necessary and possible. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the central government stipulated that the number of personnel divorced from production in the anti-Japanese base areas should not exceed 3% of the local total population. Now the subsidized work points for cadres divorced from production or partially divorced from production in agricultural cooperatives should not exceed 1%. This is completely appropriate. The number of cadres divorced from production in the three state-owned farms in Beijing can be reduced to 1.2%-1.3%, and cooperatives are even more likely to achieve this.

(2) Management expenses should also be greatly saved. The 1.5% provision in the cooperative's charter can be changed. Public welfare funds should be used more to solve the problems of the five-guarantee households and poor households. Cultural education should use as little public welfare funds as possible in the current period.

Sixth, we must advocate the policy of self-reliance and not rely on the state. Jiangsu's "four self-sufficiency" is very good, that is: self-sufficiency in funds, seeds, fertilizers, and raw materials. In this way, we can achieve "fertilizer and water not falling into other people's fields," reduce borrowing from outside the cooperative, and reduce interest expenses.

Seventh, capital construction should have long-term plans. The implementation of such planning should be combined with the Forty-Article Program. Start roughly, and then gradually refine it.

II. On Developing Pig Raising

In order to greatly develop agricultural production, the central government has decided to greatly develop chemical fertilizers. This policy is completely correct. This is an important measure to increase the yield per unit area. However, it will take a considerable amount of time to realize this policy. Even after the plan to produce 15 million tons of chemical fertilizer is realized in ten years, it will still be far from meeting the needs of agricultural development. Therefore, we must also attach importance to pig raising and fertilizer accumulation. At present, we should focus on pig raising and fertilizer accumulation and the development of green manure. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, the number of pigs in stock nationwide was more than 97.8 million at the end of last year, which dropped to more than 80 million in March this year, and had developed to 118 million by the end of August this year. Judging from the current situation, it is not a problem to exceed 120 million heads by the end of this year. The Second Five-Year Plan intends to strive to develop to 250 million heads, and the Third Five-Year Plan should strive to develop to 500 million heads. If this plan is realized, there will be four benefits:

First, it can promote agricultural production increase. According to scientists' calculations, a pig can produce 40 loads of manure fertilizer per year, which contains 4-5 thousandths of pure nitrogen. The part that can be absorbed by crops is equivalent to the pure ammonium amount contained in 60 jin of ammonium sulfate. Then, 250 million pigs are equivalent to 7.5 million tons of chemical fertilizer. If one jin of chemical fertilizer can increase grain production by 3-5 jin, then the manure fertilizer of one pig can increase grain production by 180-300 jin. 250 million pigs can increase grain production by 45 billion-75 billion jin. Discounting it by 30%, it can also increase grain production by 31.5 billion-52 billion jin. It can be seen that a pig is equivalent to a small chemical fertilizer factory, and it is manufacturing fertilizer every day. Pig manure not only contains nitrogen fertilizer, but also contains phosphorus and potassium fertilizer elements. Pig manure is organic fertilizer, which has the effect of improving soil structure and maintaining moisture. Chemical fertilizer is inorganic fertilizer and must be mixed with organic fertilizer to avoid the consequences of soil deterioration. From this point of view, pig raising and fertilizer accumulation will always be an important direction for increasing our agricultural production.

Second, it can increase meat supply. If the Second Five-Year Plan can reach 250 million pigs, with an average of 100 jin of meat per pig, that is, 25 billion jin of meat, of which 30 million heads are exported and 220 million heads are used for domestic supply. At that time, the population will be 720 million. Then, each person can eat 30 jin of meat per year, and 2.5 jin per month. In addition to cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, etc., each person can eat 40 jin of meat per year, and more than 3 jin per month. This will greatly alleviate the meat supply in urban and rural areas.

Third, it can greatly increase national income. With an average slaughter tax of 6 yuan per pig, then 250 million pigs can increase tax revenue by 1.5 billion yuan. In addition, the profit from live pig purchases is several hundred million yuan, which can reach more than 2 billion yuan. The foreign exchange obtained from exporting 30 million pigs and pig bristles is even more considerable. Exporting 20 million pigs, that is, 1 million tons of pork, can be exchanged for 5 million tons of steel, which is equivalent to our current total steel production income. It can be seen that this number is not small.

Fourth, it can increase the income of cooperatives and members. According to the current calculation of farmers raising pigs in various places, raising a pig and the income from manure price can make a profit of about 20 yuan. Then 250 million pigs can make a profit of 5 billion yuan. This is a large income for cooperatives and members. Undoubtedly, this will greatly promote the consolidation of cooperatives.

Why has pig development been so fast this year?

According to reports from various places, there are three reasons:

First, the purchase price of live pigs has been raised more reasonably, and the price of pig manure has also been appropriately increased. Some cooperatives also purchase pig manure with cash. Therefore, the enthusiasm of farmers to raise pigs has been greatly improved.

Second, the central government's policy of "private ownership, private raising, and public assistance as the main, and collective feeding as the auxiliary" has been implemented. More than 90% of the current pigs are raised privately by farmers, and cooperatives and the state provide assistance in pig sources, epidemic prevention, and loans. This proves that such a policy is a correct policy under the current conditions.

Third, the feed problem has been properly solved. According to the reflections from the symposiums of key counties and key cooperatives, there are many rough feeds for pigs. There are green feeds in various places, such as pig grass, sweet potato leaves, duckweed, water hyacinth, East Ocean grass, alfalfa, purple cloud flower, etc., which can be greatly developed in various places. The fine feed for pigs is rice bran, wheat bran, broken rice, leftover food, etc. The state adds some grain supply, especially appropriately leaving private plots and reasonably using private plots, which provides an outlet for pig feed.

Is it possible for us to develop 250 million pigs in the Second Five-Year Plan? Judging from the facts in the past six months and our specific conditions, it should be definitely possible. The reasons are:

First, farmers in our country (except for some ethnic minority areas where raising is prohibited) generally have the habit and experience of raising pigs. It is not difficult to learn for those who have not raised pigs before. Raising 250 million pigs means only raising two pigs per household on average, which is completely achievable.

Second, large amounts of rough feed can be found in various places, and there is also a portion of fine feed, such as bran, leftover food, rotten vegetables, pot-washing water, etc. The state will provide a small amount of grain, bran, soybean cake, etc. to support it, and the pig feed problem can be solved.

Third, family pig raising does not require full labor, and auxiliary labor can be used to find pig grass and herd pigs.

Fourth, the basic construction of pig raising is only building pigsties and purchasing pig troughs, which can be equipped with about 10 yuan, and does not require large investment. If it is said that developing 7 million tons of chemical fertilizer requires an investment of 7 billion yuan, then developing 250 million pigs only requires an additional construction fee of about 1 billion yuan. This can be solved by the cooperatives and members themselves. Only a small number of poor households need to be provided with some low-interest loans by the state.

Fifth, piglet specialties generally can be bred by themselves. In the future, we can further achieve that each cooperative raises boars and sows and breeds themselves.

Sixth, epidemic prevention problems, including swine fever, swine erysipelas, and swine pneumonia, can currently be solved technically. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, it is planned to basically eliminate infectious diseases such as swine fever, swine erysipelas, and swine pneumonia nationwide. Now it is only required to allocate 46 tons of steel from the Shanghai factory to manufacture seven freezers, which can mass-produce vaccines for epidemic prevention in various places. The cost of this vaccine is only a little more than one cent per injection. Charging a small fee for giving a pig an injection can guarantee that the pig will not get the disease. Farmers in various places are very welcome to this.

Based on the above six conditions, it shows that it is completely possible, and even possible to exceed, the national development of 250 million pigs during the Second Five-Year Plan. This is a production undertaking that is of great benefit to the country, cooperatives, and individual members and has no harm.

Although the possibility is great, there is now another new situation, that is, many places have restricted the development of pig raising to varying degrees. In some places, the practice of raising pigs by more pig farmers is inappropriately criticized in socialist education as wasting grain (waste is of course wrong and should be criticized). In fact, pigs do not compete with people for food, and the grain produced by pig accumulation fertilizer is more than what it eats. Some places say that raising pigs will promote the capitalist ideology of the members, so they limit the number of pigs raised by the members, such as only allowing one pig or two pigs per household. Some places force the members to convert self-raised sows into cooperatives at a discount. This has resulted in recent abnormal phenomena in some places such as selling piglets, killing small pigs, killing sows, and falling pig prices. If this phenomenon is not overcome in time, it will be very detrimental to the development of pigs.

I think this approach is inappropriate. It is absolutely necessary to prevent and oppose the growth of the capitalist spontaneous forces of the members. However, to achieve this, there is no need to take the above-mentioned approach, but the following methods should be used to prevent it:

(1) Prohibit pig farmers from purchasing grain by sets, and private plots should not grow economic crops, but only allow to grow vegetables, feed, or other small miscellaneous grains and high-yield crops.

(2) Prohibit pig farmers from hiring labor for exploitation.

(3) Prohibit selling fat pigs and piglets to outsiders to earn high prices, and selling to cooperatives or selling to the state is allowed.

(4) Prohibit raising piglets and lending at high interest rates.

(5) In places where manure prices are too high, they should be adjusted appropriately.

(6) Pig farmers must guarantee the number of workdays they undertake for the cooperative, and must not delay the workdays in the cooperative due to excessive pig raising.

I think as long as the above six points are achieved, there is no need to limit the number of pigs raised by the members. The number of pigs raised by each household may vary, and it is impossible to be completely the same. Some households with experience and lack of labor raise more pigs to make up for households with fewer pigs, and there is no harm. Pig raising is also a kind of labor. As long as it does not exploit others, does not violate laws and regulations, it should not be regarded as capitalist activity. Do not give up eating because of choking in this regard.

As for the policy of developing pig raising in the future, I think:

(1) In a considerable period of time, we should still adhere to the central government's policy of "private ownership, private raising, and public assistance as the main, and collective feeding as the auxiliary."

(2) Collective pig raising by cooperatives should also be developed, but it should be based on conditions and gradually proceed according to one's ability.

(3) For poor households who cannot afford piglets, the method of "collective ownership and private feeding, and profit sharing" can also be implemented.

(4) The cooperatives should provide assistance to the difficult households of poor and lower-middle peasants in raising pigs from loans, helping to build pigsties, supplying feed, and selling piglets on credit.

(5) Boars and sows should gradually achieve "collective breeding and private raising" and gradually improve livestock breeds. These boars and sows can be "collectively owned and collectively raised" or "collectively owned and privately raised."

(6) Existing member sows should not be forced to be priced into the cooperative to avoid killing them. It is enough to have the piglets born under the unified distribution of the cooperative, and the price should be determined according to the market price.

(7) Pig manure should be graded and priced according to its fertilizer effect. Too high or too low prices are not conducive. The manure price is best calculated in cash and paid once a month to solve the members' pocket money.

(8) Some grain-deficient cooperatives in mountainous areas lack fine feed and cannot raise fat pigs. The city service department plans to have the food company purchase small pigs and transfer them to plain cooperatives for feeding, or organize a state-controlled market at appropriate locations for farmers in mountainous and plain areas to buy and sell on their own. This method is also feasible.

(9) The state should entrust agricultural product processing, such as oil extraction, rice milling, flour milling, making noodles, and making tofu, to cooperatives so that cooperatives can obtain more fine feed from this.

The development of pig raising is of great importance to increasing agricultural production, people's lives, and national income. It is hoped that the party committees in various regions will attach importance to it and formulate plans and take effective measures to promote the rapid development of the pig raising industry. In addition, it is also hoped that development plans for cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, etc. will be formulated, and corresponding specific measures will be made. Special attention should be paid to the collection and utilization of human manure and urine. There are 540 million people in rural areas, and each person's manure and urine is more than 1,000 jin per year. If 80% can be collected, there will be more than 430 billion jin per year. This is a very amazing number.

III. On State-Owned Farms

At present, there are 456 large- and medium-sized state-owned agricultural and livestock farms in our country, with approximately 400,000 employees, owning 18 million mu of cultivated land, 9,600 tractors, and this year can produce 1.6 billion jin of grain, 240 million jin of soybeans, 480,000 dan of cotton, and 500,000 heads of large livestock including cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules, and 2,619,000 heads of small livestock such as pigs and sheep. These figures show that state-owned agricultural and livestock farms are developing. Although the proportion in national agricultural and animal husbandry production is still very small, it is a system of ownership by the whole people and is the long-term direction of our future agricultural development, and it is the best organizational form for immigrant reclamation. Therefore, we must strengthen the work of agricultural and livestock farms and rectify agricultural and livestock farms.

In recent years, the main problem of agricultural and livestock farms has been how to reverse the loss-making situation. After years of efforts, most farms have now made profits and turned them over, but some farms still lose a lot of money. This year, the Ministry of Land Reclamation has convened symposiums of various farm directors twice to further find out the root causes of the losses and discovered unreasonable aspects of production management in the past, and proposed rectification plans, which have begun to show results. The explanations are as follows:

First, why have agricultural and livestock farms always been losing money in recent years? The reasons are:

1. Too many non-production personnel. The total number of employees in agricultural and livestock farms across the country is approximately 400,000, and there are more than 50,000 cadres divorced from production, accounting for 14% of the total number of employees, and some farms have as many as 20%.

2. Wages are too high, and additional wages are unreasonable. The average monthly wage of agricultural and livestock farms across the country is 42 yuan, and the average monthly wage of ordinary agricultural and livestock workers is 32 yuan. Plus an additional wage of 12.5%, the average monthly wage is 47 yuan, and the average monthly wage of ordinary agricultural and livestock workers is 36 yuan. Such high wages not only make agricultural and livestock farms inevitably lose money, but also have a very bad impact on local farmers.

3. Serious extravagance and waste. According to incomplete statistics, in recent years, capital construction investment for non-productive construction such as offices, clubs, employee dormitories, and lighted ball fields accounted for one-fifth to one-third of capital construction investment. Even productive construction, such as livestock pens, etc., also have excessively high specifications.

4. The production management of farms mechanically uses a set of factories, such as the eight-hour working system, large weekend and small weekend rest system, etc., which violates the characteristics of decentralization and seasonality of agricultural production. For example, some farms are harvesting wheat and are threshing, but the threshing is not finished, and the end of get-off work has arrived. The workers dispersed in a swarm. Half an hour later, a rainstorm came and knocked down the wheat, and no one was responsible. Another example is that the employee dormitories of some farms are built around the field department or branch field department. This is convenient for the employees' accommodation, management, education, cultural entertainment, etc., but it is extremely unfavorable for production. Individual farm employees have to run 20-30 li to work in the fields. Farms do not have trams, cars, or bicycles available like factories. In this way, they have to run for several hours a day, and there is not much production time. Therefore, during the busy farming season, some production teams have to set up temporary tents in the distant cultivated land to live in, and the public has to spend a sum of money. Employees and their families eating at both ends also increased expenditure.

5. Farms generally implement a fixed wage system, which is not suitable for the characteristics of agricultural production. Due to the fixed wage system, not the piece-rate or production quota system, it does not matter who takes care of the work, so the labor efficiency is not very high. Some farm employees do not care when they see the crops being stolen by the people.

Second, in view of the above problems, in addition to studying production increase plans at the February meeting, some new regulations were made to rectify the farms in order to reverse the loss-making situation and give play to the superiority of state-owned agricultural and livestock farms.

1. Greatly reduce non-production personnel. It is required to reduce from 14% to 2%, mobilize cadres to participate in production, and learn from the cooperatives. By July, the number of non-production personnel had been reduced from more than 50,000 to 40,000, and more than 10,000 had returned to production. At the same time, general management cadres and technical personnel also participated in some physical labor, but management personnel still accounted for 10% of the total number of employees. Some farms have already reduced to below 5%. In the future, it will be reduced again. Recently, the three state-owned farms in Beijing have reduced to 1.2%-1.3%. If the production management system can be improved well, farms across the country may be reduced to 1%-2%.

2. Implement a low-salary system. Except for individual adjustments, the current wage is generally frozen and will no longer increase. In the future, the recruitment of new workers will be limited to an average monthly salary of less than 20 yuan. After a few years, according to the increase in labor productivity, and in combination with the length of service, the level will gradually increase to the current first-level or second-level workers. Intellectuals and young farmers who go to farms will implement an apprenticeship system or a trainee system. In this way, the high wage level can be gradually reduced after a few years.

3. It is required to reduce the additional wage. Farms are different from factories. The industrial additional wage is 12.5%, and the agricultural additional wage is also 12.5%, which is unreasonable. We require it to be reduced to below 7%. It is recommended that the State Council make explicit regulations on this point.

4. Resolutely overcome the phenomenon of extravagance and waste. In the future, new farms will not be allowed to build large auditoriums, large offices, lighted ball fields, and buy sofa chairs, etc. Employee dormitories generally adopt earthen and grass structures, and it is enough to be able to shelter from wind and rain and keep warm. A certain ratio of non-productive construction to productive construction should be stipulated, and efforts should be made to save expenses and run farms diligently and thriftily. This aspect has improved recently.

5. The production management of farms should strive to be suitable for the characteristics of decentralization, field operations, etc. of agricultural production. In the future, the wages of employees in newly built farms should generally implement a piece-rate or production quota system, or part of the fixed wage will be issued, and part will be paid from over-production rewards. If the fixed wage of existing farms is difficult to change for a while, a gradual transition method will be adopted. 60% or 70% of the wage will be paid monthly by the farm, and the remaining 30% to 40% will be paid from piece-rate, production quotas, and over-production rewards. If there are special disasters and reduced production, additional subsidies will be provided separately. This system has now been piloted in the Shuangqiao Farm dairy cow team and a vegetable group. The results of the pilot are very good. The workers' labor enthusiasm has been greatly improved. The eight-hour working system is no longer mentioned. They go to the fields early, collect work late, and the work is responsible and meticulous, and the output has also increased significantly. It is estimated that this system can be gradually promoted. This is the new reform and new atmosphere of the farm.

6. It is stipulated that the employee dormitories of newly built farms should be built in natural villages with one or several production teams as units. Let the employees' families live together, they can cook their own meals, and the farm will give a small amount of land, allowing the employees' families to usually grow vegetables, raise pigs, and engage in some household sidelines. During the busy farming season, they can work as temporary workers. In this way, employees can easily go to the fields for production, food expenses can be reduced, and wages can also be gradually reduced.

7. In order to adapt to the quarterly nature of agricultural production, it is planned to cancel the eight-hour working system and the Sunday system during the busy farming season, and change to a vacation system during the slack farming season. In short, these systems cannot mechanically imitate a set of factories. It is hoped that comrades who do trade union work will assist in this.

8. The scale of farms and production teams also needs to be adjusted appropriately. Many farms are now larger, and a farm manages hundreds of thousands or millions of mu of land. The production team is generally 100-200 people, which is also a bit large. It is planned to adopt a medium-sized and small-sized farm system. Each farm manages 30,000 to 50,000 to 100,000 to 200,000 mu (except for large farms built on the plains of Northeast China and Xinjiang). In areas with many farms, a farm group can be established, and a management agency can be established above to manage it. The production team can generally be 50-60 people to 100 people, which is appropriate, and should not be too large.

9. Farms should be allowed to engage in agricultural product processing, such as self-extracting oil, extracting sugar (in places without sugar factories), milling rice, milling flour, cured meat, pickled fish, etc., to reduce transportation power and turnover levels. The supply of grain, oil, meat, etc. required by the farm itself should be allowed to be self-produced, self-made, and self-used to reduce the food expenses of the farm employees and facilitate the implementation of the low-salary system.

10. Due to the seasonality of agricultural production, farms must also implement a diversified management policy in order to regulate the use of labor during busy and slack farming seasons. Farms must develop animal husbandry, plant green manure, and accumulate fertilizer on their own, and should not rely solely on chemical fertilizer. Livestock farms should focus on animal husbandry, but strive for self-sufficiency in grain and feed to avoid the unreasonable phenomenon of relying on external transportation of grain supply. Some farms have mountains and water nearby, and the farms should be allowed to operate forest farms and fish farms in an effort to avoid the single-product nature of production.

These are the preliminary methods that have been explored in recent months and are still in the research and pilot stage. It will take a process to formulate a complete set of systems. But in general, the direction is set. Because only in this way can it be suitable for the characteristics of agricultural production, facilitate the development of farm production, and facilitate changing the loss-making situation into a money-making situation. It is hoped that the party committees at all levels will strengthen their leadership over the farms, especially to carry out the farm rectification movement, let go of the mass line and encourage free airing of views, let correct and incorrect, reasonable and unreasonable opinions be aired, and do a good job in the farm's operating principles and production management work so that the farm can play a leading and exemplary role in the entire agricultural production.

    关于农业合作社扩大再生产及其他几个问题
    ——邓子恢同志在中共中央扩大的八届三中全会上发言的一部分——
    一、关于农业生产合作社不断扩大再生产问题
    今后发展农业生产，主要依靠办好农业生产合作社；不断扩大再生产则是发展农业生产，争取五年左右时间赶上或者超过当地上中农的生产水平，真正巩固合作社的基本关键。今年9月间开的全国农村工作会议，着重讨论了这个问题，各地就此交流了经验，一般有以下几个问题：
    第一，扩大再生产，最基本的是扩大基本建设。内容主要是：
    （一）因地制宜、兴修水利，发展灌溉，减轻或消灭水旱灾害，并添置相应的提水排水工具，这是保证农业生产发展的命脉。
    （二）挖掘肥源、增积肥料、精耕细作。
    （三）在兴修水利、增积肥料的基础上，实行耕作制度的改革，如旱改水，单改双，坡地改梯田等，这是几年来各地农业增产的有效措施。
    （四）向山上发展，造林植树，发展油料作物，纤维作物和果树等，这样，一方面可以绿化山林，保持水土，涵养水源，调节气候，一方面又可以扩大合作社的长期收入。
    （五）农产品加工业，国家尽可能交给合作社经营。这样，一方面可以增加合作社的副业收入，将油饼等作为肥料饲料；另一方面国家可以减少原料副产品长途调运的损失。为此，农业社要逐步购置加工设备和副业设备。
      （六）发展畜牧业及相应的基本建设。农牧业是互相支援而又互相依存的不可分割的两个环节。
      （七）改良农具及添置必要的适用的农业机器。
      （八）发展改善交通运输和交通运输工具。
    第二，扩大再生产的资金来源：主要靠合作社自力更生，靠社员辛勤劳动。办法是：在保证社员逐年增加收入的基础上逐年扩大公积金，可以考虑修改社章有关规定，由各地各社看情况办理，可以超过5％—8％的规定，丰收年景，特别是经济作物区可以达到12％以上，这样可以增加积累，又可以减少暴发户，避免浪费，并补歉收年的不足。此外，国家在基建投资中应拨出一定比例的资金投入农林水利基本建设，如兴修必要的大中型水利工程、拨一定的造林经费、建立拖拉机站抽水机站等，以支援农林业生产。这是扩大再生产，促进农林业生产更快发展的重要因素。
    第三，动员社员适当地多出基建劳动日，这是扩大再生产的基本出路。有些地方可按每个社员每年抽10％左右的工作日。如以全国全劳力二亿人计算，每年每人出工十天就是二十亿个工作日，如果每人出工二十天就是四十亿个工作日，这是一个非常巨大的力量。
    基建劳动是义务工还是当年分红，各地可以酌情自定。
    （一）最好是当年分红，这更可以发挥社员的劳动积极性，避免劳力浪费，但分值要低一些，要向社员讲清楚。
    （二）社员觉悟高的社可以当年记工，俟有收益时再分红。
    （三）造林可以三年包栽、包活，俟成活时再支付工款。
    （四）完全义务工也可以，但要经过充分动员与组织领导。避免劳力浪费。
    第四，要做好生产管理工作，使能充分发挥社员的劳动积极性，既能增加出勤率，提高劳动效能，又能把辅助劳力都使用上，劳动创造价值，这是做好当年生产和扩大基本建设的基本关键。我们过去对这个工作没做好，许多地方劳动效能不高，窝工浪费，去冬今春以来各地创造了比较适合于农业生产分散性，野外作业、手工操作等特点的生产管理制度，即是统一经营、分级管理、明确分工、个人负责制度。具体做法有以下几方面：
    （一）实行三包制。即包工、包产、包财务，这是固定社与队关系的一种最好办法。社将土地、耕畜、农具、肥料、种籽等交给生产队负责管理，在报酬上究竟是做多少工，记多少工，还是包工制？在农作物收获上是产多少交多少，还是包产制？在财务开支上是用多少报多少，还是包财务制度？显然三包制是比较少弊端，少争吵，从而也是比较进步的制度。
    （二）实行两个指标，超产提成，减产扣分制度。这使队与社关系进一步合理化。过去各地也有包工包产制，但包产指标与计划指标多是一个指标，队员看到完成计划指标把握不大，就能完成也超产不大，提成不多，因此积极性往往不高。现在改为两个指标，计划指标略高于实际产量，而包产指标则略低于实际产量，使包产的队有产可超，有成可提，这是鼓励队员积极性的有效办法，只要队员积极性高，超了产，队员好，社也好，国家也好，这是有利无害的，当然包产指标太低也不好。如果没有特殊原因，减了产，适当加以处分也是必要的。
    （三）“工包到组，组包片”。这是固定队与组关系的一种办法。生产队把某一片地的季节农活交给组去经营，是采取评工记分的老办法，还是按片按季节农活包工好呢？显然包片包工制，是比较进步的，这样就可以避免队长“临时派工”、临时“调兵遣将”，浪费时间的毛病。
    （四）“田间零活包到户”。这是固定组与组员关系的办法之一。过去是每日评工记分，既浪费时间，又容易争吵。现在改为“按田定额，包工到户”，把一般田间零活的工分都事先评定好，包给户去做，这样全劳力、半劳力、辅助劳力都可以用上，早晚做，白天做都可以，横直从数量上、质量上保证按季节做完活，就可得工分。这样明确分工，个人负责，又可以避免耕作粗糙的现象。
    （五）“大活集体干，小活分开干”。过去不少社干部误解集体劳动，“敲钟集合，等齐下地”，“干活一窝蜂”“班、排进攻”，劳力浪费的现象很严重，实行这种办法，就可以把它克服过来。主要农活必须集体干，有些活可以由各户分散去干，就是集体干的活，也要分块、分地段、划清界限，彼此分头进行，以收事半功倍之效。
    现在看来，这些管理制度是适合于当前农业生产的特点的。全国多数社已推行，但尚有部分社未推行，或推行得不好。希望各地党委根据中央指示和各地情况，大力推行。这是提高劳动效能，发挥社员劳动积极性，搞好农业生产和扩大再生产的根本环节。
    第五，要扩大再生产，必须贯彻勤俭办社的方针，这里必须注意：
    （一）大大减少脱产干部，减少工分补贴，我们提议改变社章1．5％—2％的规定，改为不超过1％。照目前情况看来，这是完全必要的也是可能的，抗战时期中央规定敌后根据地的脱产人员不超过当地总人口的3％。现在农业社脱产半脱产干部的补贴工分不超过1％。是完全应该的，北京三个国营农场的脱产干部可以减少到1．2％—1．3％，合作社更可能做到。
    （二）管理费用也应大大节省，可以改变社章中1．5％的规定，公益金应多用于解决五保户和贫困户，文化教育在目前时期应尽量少用公益金。
    第六，必须提倡自力更生政策，不要依赖国家。江苏的“四自给”很好，即：资金、种子、肥料、原料自给，这样就可以做到“肥水不落别人田”，减少向社外贷款，就可以减少利息支出。
    第七，基本建设要有长期规划。进行这样的规划要与四十条纲要结合起来，开始粗一些，以后慢慢具体化。
    二、关于发展养猪问题
    为了大量发展农业生产，中央决定大量发展化学肥料。这个方针是完全正确的。这是提高单位面积产量的一个重要措施。但实现这个方针，还须要相当长的时间，即使在十年内实现了生产一千五百万吨化肥的计划以后，也还远不能满足农业发展的需要。因此，我们还必须重视养猪积肥。在目前则更应以养猪积肥、发展绿肥为主。据农业部统计，全国圈存生猪去年年底是九千七百八十多万头，今年3月降到八千多万头，到今年8月底已发展到一万一千八百万头。照现在情况来看，到今年年底超过一亿二千万头是不成问题的。第二个五年计划拟争取发展到二亿五千万头，第三个五年计划应争取发展到五亿头。如果这个计划实现，将有四个好处：
    第一，可以促进农业增产。据科学家计算，一头猪年可产粪肥四十担，其中含纯氮量千分之四至五，可以被农作物吸收的部分相当于六十斤硫酸铵所含的纯铵量，那么二亿五千万头猪就等于七百五十万吨化肥，如果一斤化肥可增产粮食三斤至五斤，那么一头猪的粪肥可以增产粮食一百八十斤至三百斤，二亿五千万头猪就可以增产粮食四百五十亿斤至七百五十亿斤，把它打个七折，也可增产三百一十五亿斤至五百二十亿斤。由此可见，一头猪就等于一个小的化肥工厂，它天天在制造肥料。猪粪中不仅有氮肥，而且还含有磷肥、钾肥的因素，猪肥是有机肥料，有改良土壤结构和保持水分的作用。化肥是无机肥料，必须和有机肥混合施用，才能避免土壤恶化的后果。从这方面来看，养猪积肥永远是我们农业增产的重要方向。
    第二，可以增加肉食供应。如果第二个五年计划能达到二亿五千万头猪，每头猪平均以一百斤肉计算，即有二百五十亿斤肉，其中以三千万头出口，二亿二千万头猪作为国内供应，那时候人口以七亿二千万计算，那么每人每年可吃肉三十斤，每月可吃二斤半，再加上牛、羊、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等，每人每年将可吃肉四十斤，每月每人可吃三斤多，这对城乡的肉食供应将可以大大缓和下来。
    第三，可以大大增加国家收入。每头猪平均以收屠宰税六元计算，那么二亿五千万头猪便可增加税收十五亿元，再加上生猪收购利润几亿元，可达二十亿元以上。三千万头猪和猪鬃出口，所得外汇更是可观。出口二千万头猪，即一百万吨猪肉，可以换回五百万吨钢，即相等于我们现在全部产钢收入。可见这个数目是不小的。
    第四，可以增加合作社和社员的收入。照现在各地农民养猪计算，养一头猪并粪价收入可以获利二十元左右，那么二亿五千万头猪就可获利五十亿元，这对合作社和社员是一笔大收入，无疑地这将大大促进合作社的巩固。
    为什么今年生猪发展这样快呢？
    据各地反映，原因有三：
    第一，是生猪收购价提高得更合理一些，猪粪价也适当提高了，有些社猪粪还用现金收购，因此农民养猪的积极性大为提高了。
    第二，是贯彻了中央关于私有、私养、公助为主集体饲养为辅的方针。现在的猪90％以上是农民私养的，合作社和国家在猪源、防疫、贷款上加以帮助，证明这样的方针，在目前条件下是一个正确的方针。
    第三，饲料问题得到了适当解决。据这次重点县重点社座谈会上反映，猪的粗饲料很多，各地都有青饲料，如猪草、薯叶、浮萍、水浮莲、东洋草、苜蓿、紫云英等，各地都可大量发展。猪的精饲料则用米糠、麦麸、碎米、剩余饭菜等，国家再加上一部分粮食供应，特别是适当的留下自留地和合理使用自留地，更为猪饲料找到了出路。
    我们要在第二个五年发展二点五亿头猪是不是可能呢？照半年来事实和我们的具体条件来看，应该肯定是可能的，理由是：
    第一，我国农民（除一部分少数民族禁养地区外）一般都有养猪的习惯和经验，原来没有养过猪的，要学也并不很难，养猪二点五亿头，平均每户只养二头猪，这是完全有把握的。
    第二，各地都可找到大量粗饲料，并有一部分精饲料，如糠麸、残饭，烂菜、刷锅水等，国家再加以小量粮食、糠麸、豆饼等支援，养猪饲料问题是可以解决的。
    第三，农家养猪不需要全劳力，尽可以用辅助劳力去找猪草、放猪等。
    第四，养猪的基本建设只是盖猪圈、购置喂猪糟桶等，有十元左右便可置备，用不着很大投资，如果说发展七百万吨化肥要投资七十亿，那么发展二点五亿头猪，所要增添的基建费只花十亿元左右便足够了。这方面合作社和社员可以自己解决，只对少数贫困户由国家放一部分低利贷款便够了。
    第五，猪仔各专县一般都可以自己繁殖，将来可以进一步做到各社养公猪母猪，自己繁殖。
    第六，防疫问题，包括猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫等，在技术上目前已可以解决。在第二个五年计划时期内打算在全国范围内基本上消灭猪瘟、猪丹毒和猪肺疫等传染病。现只要求多拨上海厂四十六吨钢制成七台冷冻器，就可以大量制造疫苗，供应各地防疫之用，这种疫苗一针成本只要一分多钱，给猪打一针收费不多，便可保证猪不发瘟，各地农民对此非常欢迎。
    根据以上六个条件，说明第二个五年计划全国发展到二点五亿头猪是完全可能的，甚至有可能超过。这是一个对国家、合作社、社员个人都有大利而无一害的生产事业。
    虽然可能性很大，但现在却有另一个新情况，即是不少地方程度不同地发生了限制发展养猪的现象，有些地方在社会主义教育中不适当地批评养猪户养猪多浪费粮食（浪费当然是错误的，应该批评），其实猪并不与人争食，猪积肥所增产的粮食比它吃的还多。有些地方则说养猪会促成社员的资本主义思想，因此限制社员养猪头数，如一户只准养一头猪或二头猪；有些地方则强将社员自养母猪折价入社。从而造成最近某些地方纷纷卖小猪、杀克郎猪、杀母猪、猪价下跌等不正常现象。这种现象如不及时克服，对猪的发展是很不利的。
    我认为这种作法是不妥当的，防止和反对社员的资本主义自发势力的增长，是绝对必要的。但是要做到这一点并不需要采取上述作法，而应从下列办法加以防止：
    （一）禁止养猪户套购粮食，自留地不要种经济作物，只允许种菜、种饲料或其他小杂粮高产作物。
    （二）禁止养猪户雇工剥削。
    （三）禁止把肥猪仔猪卖给社外赚高价，卖给社内或卖给国家都可以。
    （四）禁止放养猪仔，放高利贷。
    （五）在粪价过高的地方，应适当调整。
    （六）要养猪户保证对社所承担的出工数，不能因养猪过多耽误社内出工。
    我认为只要做到上述六点，对社员养猪多少可以不加限制，各户养猪有多有少，也不可能完全一样，有些有经验而又缺劳力户养猪多一些来弥补养猪少的户，并无坏处，养猪也是一种劳动，只要不剥削别人，不违反法令，不应该把它看成资本主义活动，这方面不要因噎废食。
    至于今后发展养猪的方针，我认为：
    （一）在相当长的时期内，仍应坚持中央关于私有私养公助为主，集体饲养为辅的方针。
    （二）合作社集体养猪也要发展，但应看条件，逐步量力而行。
    （三）对贫困户买不起仔猪的，也可实行“社有私喂，收益分成”的办法。
    （四）社要从贷款，帮助盖猪圈，供应饲料，赊卖仔猪等帮助贫农下中农的困难户养猪。
    （五）公猪母猪应逐渐做到“社繁私养”，并逐步改良畜种。这些公母猪“公有公养”或“公有私养”都可以。
    （六）现有社员母猪，不要勉强作价入社，以免杀掉，只要将所生仔猪归社统一支配就够了，价格应按照市价决定。
    （七）猪粪要按肥效分等定价，过高过低都不利，粪价最好用现金计算，每月支付一次，以解决社员的零花钱。
    （八）有些山区缺粮社缺乏精饲料，无法养肥猪的，城市服务部拟由食品公司，收购克郎猪转卖给平原社喂养，或在适当地点组织国家控制下的市场，由山区和平原农民自行买卖，这个办法也是可行的。
    （九）国家应该尽可能把农产品加工，如榨油、碾米、磨面、做粉条、磨豆腐等交给合作社承办，使合作社能从此多得一些精饲料。
    发展养猪问题关系农业增产人民生活和国家收入极大，希望各地党委加以重视，并定出计划，采取有效措施，来推进养猪事业的迅速发展。此外，还希望定出牛、羊、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等的发展规划，并作出相应的具体措施。特别要注意人粪尿的收集和利用。农村有五亿四千万人口，每人每年的粪尿在一千斤以上，如能收集到80％，每年就有四千三百亿斤以上，这是一个十分惊人的数字。
    三、关于国营农场问题
    目前我国的大中型国营农、牧场已有四百五十六处，职工约四十万人，拥有耕地一千八百万亩，拖拉机九千六百台，今年可产粮食十六亿斤，大豆二亿四千万斤，棉花四十八万担，大牲畜包括牛马驴骡等共五十万头，猪羊等小家畜二百六十一万九千头。这些数目字说明国营农牧场正在发展中，虽然在全国农牧业生产中所占比重还很小，但它是全民所有制，是我们将来农业发展的长远方向，而且是移民垦荒的最好组织形式。因此，必须加强农牧场工作，把农牧场整顿好。
    几年来农牧场主要问题是如何扭转赔钱局面。经过几年来的努力，现多数农场已有利润上缴，但部分农场仍然亏本很大，今年农垦部两次召开各场长座谈会，进一步找出了赔钱根源，并发现了过去生产管理上不合理的地方，提出了整顿方案，开始收到了效果，现分别说明如下：
    第一，几年来农牧场为什么老是赔钱呢？原因是：
    1、非生产人员太多，全国农牧场职工总数约四十万人，脱产干部共五万多人，占职工总数14％，有的场多至20％。
    2、工资过高，附加工资不合理，全国农牧场每月平均工资四十二元，普通农牧工三十二元。再加上附加工资12．5％，则平均月工资为四十七元，普通农牧工为三十六元，这样高的工资不仅农牧场不能不赔本，而且给当地农民影响很坏。
    3、严重的铺张浪费现象，据不完全统计，几年来基建投资用于非生产性建设如办公室、俱乐部、职工宿舍、灯光球场等占基建投资的五分之一到三分之一，就是生产性建设，如畜舍等也规格过高。
    4、农场的生产管理机械地搬用工厂的一套，如八小时工作制，大礼拜小礼拜休息制等，这是违背农业生产分散性、季节性等特点的，譬如有些农场收麦子正在打场，但场未打完，下班时间已到，工人一哄而散，半小时之后暴风雨一来，把麦子打掉，谁也不负责。又如有些场的职工宿舍都盖在场部或分场部周围，这对职工的住宿、管理、教育、文化娱乐等是方便的，但对生产则极为不利，个别场职工下地干活要跑二三十里路，农场不像工厂有电车、汽车自行车可用，这样一天光跑路就得几个钟头，生产时间就不多了，因此农忙时有的生产队就得在较远耕地里打临时帐棚住宿，公家又得花上一笔钱。职工和他的家属两头吃饭，也增加了支出。
    5、农场一般是实行固定工资制，这也不适宜于农业生产的特点，由于固定工资制，不是包工包产制，“管不管二斤半”，因此劳动效能就不很高，有些农场职工，看到庄稼给老百姓偷了谁也不在乎。
    第二，鉴于以上毛病，在今年二月会议上除了研究增产方案外，并作出整顿农场的一些新规定，以扭转赔钱局面，而发挥国营农牧场的优越性。
    1、是大大裁减非生产人员。要求从14％降到2％，动员干部参加生产，向合作社看齐。到七月间统计非生产人员已由五万多减到四万人，有一万多回到生产中去了，同时一般管理干部和技术人员也都参加了一些体力劳动，但是管理人员仍占职工总数10％，有些场已经减到5％以下，今后要再行裁减，最近北京三个国营农场已减到1．2％—1．3％，如果生产管理制度能很好改进，全国的农场都可能减到1％—2％。
    2、实行低薪制。现有工资除个别调整外，一般冻结不再增加，今后吸收新工人只限于月薪平均二十元以下，经过几年以后，根据劳动生产率的提高，并结合工龄逐年增加到现在一级或二级工的水平，知识分子及青年农民到农场则实行学徒制或见习生制度，这样过几年后可以把高工资水平逐步降低下来。
    3、要求附加工资降低。农场不同于工厂，工业附加工资是12．5％，农场附加工资也是12．5％，这是不合理的。我们要求降到7％以下。这一点建议国务院作明文规定。
    4、坚决克服铺张浪费现象。今后新建场一律不准盖大礼堂、大办公室，不建灯光球场，不准买沙发椅等，职工宿舍一般采取土木草结构，只求能避风雨能御寒足矣，要规定非生产建设与生产建设的一定比例，力求节约开支，勤俭办场，这一方面最近已有好转。
    5、农场的生产管理应力求适合于农业生产的分散性野外作业等特点。以后新建场职工工资一般应实行包工包产制，或部分发固定工资，部分由超产提成支付。现有场固定工资一时难于改变，则采取逐步过渡办法，工资的60％或70％由场方按月支付，其余30％至40％则由包工包产、超产提成中支付之，遇特殊灾害减产者另行补贴。这个制度现已在双桥农场奶牛队及一个蔬菜组试行，试行结果成绩很好，工人劳动积极性大大提高，八小时工作制不讲了，早下地、晚收工、工作负责细致，产量也显著提高，估计这个制度可以逐步推广，这是农场的新改革新气象。
    6、今后新建场的职工宿舍规定以一个或几个生产队为单位建立自然村。让职工家属一起住，可以自起伙食，由场方给以小量土地，允许职工家属平时种菜喂猪，搞一些家庭副业，农忙时则做临时工。这样职工便于下地生产，伙食可以减低，工资也可以逐步下降。
    7、为适应农业生产的季度性，拟取消八小时工作制及农忙时的星期日制，而改为农闲时的休假制度。总之，这些制度不能机械模仿工厂的一套，这一点希望做工会工作的同志协助。
    8、农场和生产队规模也有适当调整之必要，现在许多农场大了一些，一个农场管几十万上百万亩土地。生产队一般是一百至二百人，也大了一些，拟采取中小型农场制度，每场管三万五万多至十万二十万亩（东北、新疆平原上已建大型农场例外），农场多的地区可建立农场群，上面成立一个管理机构去管理他。生产队一般也可以五六十人多至一百人为宜，不宜太大。
    9、农场应该允许搞农产品加工，如自己榨油、榨糖（在没有糖厂地方）、辗米、磨面、腊肉、腌鱼等，以减少运输力和周转层次。农场本身需要的粮食、油料、肉食等供应，应允许自产自制自用，以降低农场职工的伙食费，而便于低薪制的实行。
    10、由于农业生产的季节性，农场也必须实行多种经营方针，以便调节农忙农闲时期的劳力使用。农场必须发展畜牧业，种绿肥，自积肥料，不要单靠化肥。牧场以畜牧为主，但要力求粮食饲料自给，避免靠外边运粮供应的不合理现象。有些农场附近有山有水，应允许农场经营林场渔场，力求避免生产的单一化。
    这些都是最近几个月摸索出来的初步办法，尚在研究试行阶段，要定出完整的一套制度还要有一个过程。但一般说来方向是定了的。因为只有这样才适合于农业生产的特点，才便于农场生产的发展，才便于改变赔钱局面为赚钱局面。希望各级党委加强对农场的领导，特别要开展农场整风运动，放手发动鸣放，让正确的、不正确的，合理的、不合理的意见都鸣放出来，把农场的经营方针、生产管理工作搞好，使农场在整个农业生产中起带头作用和示范作用。
