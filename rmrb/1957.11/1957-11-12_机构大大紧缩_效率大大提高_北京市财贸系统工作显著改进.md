Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The rectification work of thirty-nine companies in Beijing's financial and trade system has achieved great results. As of the end of October, over 78,000 suggestions put forward by employees have been basically processed, with the exception of those submitted to higher authorities or relevant departments for handling. At present, the staff of most companies has been reduced by more than half, some long-standing problems in business management have been initially resolved, the leadership style has improved, and all companies have shown unprecedented new vitality.

Of the 70,000-plus suggestions made by employees of these companies, about 70% related to business management, organizational personnel, and leadership style. The leadership focused its efforts on resolving these three areas. Starting in mid-September, amidst the city-wide upsurge of sending cadres to participate in agricultural labor, the companies also sent over 2,000 cadres to participate in agricultural labor or to work as salespersons in grassroots stores. After the personnel reduction, the companies vigorously adjusted their organizational structures, improving shortcomings such as complicated procedures and redundant reports. The Beijing Food Company has merged five secondary management agencies with the company headquarters, which not only reduced personnel by 61% but also overcame duplication and contradictions in the work of the company and secondary management agencies. The Beijing Timber Company merged several business-related departments into one business office and established a political work office, led by two managers with division of labor, greatly reducing intermediate levels. Many companies merged departments with similar functions and eliminated sections and groups within the departments, with department heads directly leading the business and dividing labor to take on specific tasks. Some companies delegated some tasks that did not require unified management by the company to the grassroots level, greatly reducing the company's administrative work. After research by various departments, the Beijing Cultural Goods Company simplified eleven types of procedures and reports. For example, the sales procedures for wholesale stations were reduced from seven steps to four, saving manpower and shortening the delivery time. The Beijing Textile Company also canceled three types of reports and simplified the content of eight types of reports. After improving working methods, the work efficiency of some units has significantly improved. In the past, the storage and transportation section of the Beijing Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Textile Company had sixteen cadres and could only send out more than twenty truckloads of goods per month. Now, with only ten people, they send out more than fifty truckloads per month.

In terms of business management, the focus was on resolving common problems in various companies, such as blind procurement, mismatched goods, resulting in serious stockpiles and waste, chaotic price management, untimely pricing and price adjustments with many errors, and poor commodity storage, causing serious losses to state property. The companies quickly dealt with some of these problems that urgently needed to be resolved. Many companies conducted a general inspection of material stockpiles and immediately organized manpower to vigorously promote sales. The Trust Company organized personnel to go to other places to promote the sale of long-stockpiled cameras and other valuable items, selling a total of 260,000 yuan worth of goods. The Sugar and Pastry Company processed 160,000 jin of imported granulated sugar with high water content before selling it to avoid losses. The Grain Storage and Transportation Company found that the number of "four-free grain depots" (free of rats, insects, mildew, and accidents) was decreasing and immediately mobilized the masses to eliminate the "four pests" and studied and implemented storage methods for preventing mildew, insects, and freezing. Currently, the number of "four-free warehouses" has increased from twenty-three to sixty.

The companies also generally examined the causes of these problems and formulated some systems to address the weak links, in order to fundamentally solve the problems. Many companies believed that in the past, there was insufficient education for purchasing agents when purchasing goods, and they were not helped to understand local market conditions. In addition, some company leaders simply emphasized completing purchasing tasks, which was an important reason for blind procurement. Therefore, cultural goods and other companies have stipulated that before purchasing agents depart, the company manager must personally report the market situation and explain the tasks. The Textile Company decided to periodically recall purchasing agents stationed in other places for intensive training. Some companies also strengthened purchasing and acceptance forces in conjunction with organizational rectification. The Native Produce Company transferred two wholesale department directors to serve as leaders of purchasing groups stationed in other places. The number of acceptance personnel in the Cultural Goods Company was increased from three to five, and the acceptance system was re-drafted. The Beijing Pharmaceutical Company determined the reasonable loss rate for some commodities and stipulated specific methods for classified storage of commodities. In terms of price management, some companies improved price management methods, stipulating that new arrivals must be priced within two or three days, and took measures to prevent errors in price adjustments. The Pharmaceutical Company printed the purchase prices of all varieties into small booklets so that all cadres managing prices would be familiar with prices.

There has also been great improvement in leadership style. Many company managers and department heads not only examined their own lack of in-depth work and various subjective and bureaucratic errors to the masses but also proposed specific ways to improve in the future, asking the masses to supervise. The companies also generally stipulated the time for leading cadres to go to the grassroots level and receive the masses every week. Many leading cadres have already gone to various departments or grassroots stores to understand the situation and solve problems. The deputy heads of the business department and the private enterprise department of the Cultural Goods Company jointly went deep into the joint state-private cultural goods stores to understand the situation and quickly assisted more than twenty joint-venture stores in adding 3,600 kinds of commodities.

Judging from the current situation, most of the problems that should be solved and can be solved have been solved. Some problems cannot be solved in a short period of time and require careful research and proposals by various companies and higher-level leading organs. In order to check whether these work improvements are thorough and appropriate, the companies are also taking measures such as mobilizing the masses with leadership and holding employee representative meetings to review the issues that have been resolved.

### 机构大大紧缩  效率大大提高  北京市财贸系统工作显著改进

    机构大大紧缩  效率大大提高
    北京市财贸系统工作显著改进
    新华社11日讯　北京市财贸系统三十九个公司整改工作获得很大成绩。截至10月底，职工群众提出的七万八千多条意见，除交上级或有关部门处理的以外，已经基本上处理完毕。目前绝大多数公司的人员都紧缩了一半以上，经营管理上长期存在的一些问题初步得到了解决，领导作风有了改进，各公司都出现了从未有的新气象。
    这些公司的职工们提出的七万多条意见中，有关经营管理、机构人事、领导作风三方面的意见，约占70％。领导上集中力量解决了这三方面的问题。从9月中旬开始，在全市各部门下放干部参加农业劳动的热潮中，各公司也下放了二千多干部参加农业劳动或到基层商店做售货员。人员紧缩后，各公司紧接着大力调整了组织机构，改进了手续制度繁杂、表报重复等缺点。北京市食品公司已经把五个二级管理机构和公司本部合并，这样，不但人员减少了61％，而且克服了公司和二级管理机构工作上的重复和矛盾。北京市木材公司把几个业务方面的科室合并成一个业务办公室，另外成立一个政治工作办公室，由两个经理分工领导，大大减少了中间层次。很多公司把性质相近的科室合并，把科内的股、组取消，科长直接领导业务并且分工担任了一定的具体工作。有的公司把一部分不需要公司统一管理的工作下放到基层，使公司的事务工作大大减少。北京市文化用品公司经各科室研究后，简化了十一种手续制度和表报，如批发站的销货手续就由七道改为四道，即节省人力又缩短了提货时间。北京市纺织品公司也取消了三种表报、简化了八种表报的内容。在改进工作方法后，部分单位的工作效率有显著提高。中国纺织品公司北京采购供应站储运科过去十六个干部，一个月只能发走二十多车货，现在减少到十人，一个月发走了五十多车。
    在经营管理方面，着重解决了各公司普遍存在的如盲目采购，货不对路，形成严重的积压和浪费，物价管理混乱，定价、调价不及时，差错很多，商品保管不善使国家财产遭受严重损失等问题。各公司对其中一些目前迫切需要解决的问题，迅速作了处理。许多公司普遍检查了物资积压的情况，立即组织人力大力推销。信托公司组织力量到外地推销积压很久的照相机等贵重物品，共销售了价值二十六万元的商品；糖业糕点公司把含水量很大的进口砂糖十六万斤，加工后再出售，避免了损失；粮食储运公司发现“四无粮仓”数量下降，立即发动群众除“四害”，并研究和贯彻了防霉、防虫、防冻的保管办法，目前“四无仓库”已由二十三幢增加到六十幢。
    各公司还普遍检查了这些问题产生的原因，并针对着薄弱的环节拟订了一些制度，以便从根本上解决问题。许多公司认为过去在进货时对采购员教育不够，没有帮助他们了解当地市场情况，加上有的公司领导上单纯强调完成进货任务，是造成盲目采购的重要原因，因此文化用品等公司都规定了在采购员出发前，公司经理要亲自报告市场情况交代任务的制度；纺织品公司决定把长驻外地的采购员定期调回集训。有些公司还结合整顿机构加强了采购和验收力量。土产公司调了两个批发部主任担任驻外地的采购组长，文化用品公司验收员由三人增至五人，并重新拟订了验收制度。北京市药材公司确定了一些商品的合理损耗率，并规定了商品分类保管的具体办法。在价格管理方面，有些公司改进了物价管理办法，规定新到商品必须在两天或三天内确定价格，并采取措施防止调价中的差错，药材公司将所有的品种的收购价格都印成小册子，使所有管理物价的干部都熟悉物价。
    在领导作风方面，也有了很大的改进。许多公司的经理、科长不但向群众检查了自己工作不深入和各种主观主义、官僚主义的错误，而且提出了今后改进的具体办法，要求群众监督。各公司还普遍规定领导干部每星期深入下层和接待群众的时间；不少领导干部已经到各科室或基层商店了解情况，解决问题。文化用品公司业务科和私营企业科的副科长共同深入公私合营文化用品商店了解情况，很快地协助二十多户合营商店增添了三千六百种商品。
    从目前情况看来，凡是应该解决，也能够解决的一些问题是大部分解决了；有些问题不是短时期能够解决的，需要各个公司和上级领导机关认真研究提出办法。为了检查这些工作改进得是否彻底、妥善，对于已经解决的问题各个公司也正在采取有领导地发动群众、召开职工代表会等方式进行复查。
