Based on the large number of problems exposed from all sides, the Shanghai Party Committee and government leadership organs are now simultaneously and vigorously implementing major rectification and major changes, severely rectifying work style, improving work, and focusing on correcting the special privileges of leading cadres and overcoming the three isms [subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism]. Major rectification and major changes also start from the leadership. The secretaries of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretariat made self-criticisms to the cadres present at the rectification and discussion meeting of the Municipal Party Committee organs regarding special privileges and work style issues, expressed their determination to rectify, and requested the masses to continue to offer criticisms to them. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee has also taken measures to abolish certain special treatments for responsible cadres, and also stipulated that every Thursday is the activity day for leaders of municipal-level organs to go deep into the grassroots, connect with the masses, or participate in productive labor. This measure has now begun to be implemented. On the 28th, more than 400 people, including the secretaries of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, department and bureau chiefs of the Municipal Party Committee, and deputy mayors of Shanghai and responsible cadres of various bureaus and departments, went to the suburbs to labor with the farmers and had cordial conversations with the farmers. Recently, in studying the work for the fourth quarter, the secretaries of the Luwan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party went deep into grassroots factories, investigated more than a dozen representative factories, and made a comprehensive inspection of the work of more than 20 factories, changing the past work style of being detached from reality and detached from the masses. In order to fundamentally change the phenomenon of excessive personnel and overlapping institutions in various organs, the overall reorganization plan for Shanghai has also been initially formulated. According to this plan, approximately 140,000 cadres throughout the city will be transferred to rural areas and grassroots units to participate in productive labor or grassroots work. At present, a surge of registration to go to rural areas and grassroots has been launched in many units.

    领导上痛下大改决心
    市委书记公开进行自我批评
    处长以上干部定期深入基层
    根据各方面所揭露出来的大量问题，上海党委和政府各领导机关现在正同时雷厉风行地实行大整大改，狠狠地整顿作风，改进工作，着重纠正领导干部的特殊化和克服三个主义。大整大改同样首先从领导上开始，上海市委书记处各书记在市委机关工作人员整改讨论大会上，就特殊化与作风问题向到会干部作了自我检查，表示整改决心，要求群众继续对他们提出批评。上海市委并已采取措施，取消了负责干部的某些特殊待遇，还规定每星期四为市级机关领导干部深入基层、联系群众或参加劳动生产的活动日，这个措施现在已开始实施，28日上海市委书记处书记、市委各部处长以上干部，和上海市副市长、各局、处长负责干部四百余人，分别到郊区和农民一起劳动，并和农民进行了亲切的谈话。中共芦湾区委最近在研究第四季度工作中，书记们纷纷深入基层工厂，曾调查了十几个有代表性的工厂，对二十多个工厂的工作作了全面检查，改变了过去脱离实际脱离群众的作风。为了从根本上改变各机关人员过多，机构重叠的现象，上海全市的整编方案也已初步制订完成，根据这个方案，全市范围内约有十四万干部下放到农村和基层单位参加生产劳动或基层工作。目前许多单位里已掀起了一个报名到农村和基层去的热潮。
