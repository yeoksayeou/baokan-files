    "The Man with a Gun" on the Screen

    One day at noon, the rehearsal hall of the Beijing People's Art Theater's production of "The Man with a Gun" seemed busier than usual. It turned out that the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio was filming a documentary about the play's rehearsals.

    Outside the rehearsal hall, the generator was humming. Dozens of actors dressed as Russian soldiers, sailors, and Red Guards were practicing their marching in unison. In the makeup room, special effects makeup artist Wang Xizhong was meticulously sculpting the wide forehead of actor Diao Guangqin, who was playing Lenin. Directors Ouyang Shanzun and Xia Chun, based on the requirements of the film shots, were carefully studying the script with the main actors before filming. Stage workers and photographers were even busier.

    The directors chose to film two extremely important scenes from the play: one was when Ivan Shadov, guided by the worker Red Guard Chebisov, unconsciously embarked on the revolutionary road of "conquering the whole world" from his worries about his "land" and "cattle," and the second was Shadov's meeting with the great leader Lenin in the corridors of Smolny.

    Now the second scene begins:

    "Tap, tap, tap," a man with a broad forehead walked down the high stairs. He had his left hand tucked under his armpit, his head slightly tilted, contemplating something important with victorious confidence. Everyone would recognize this as the great revolutionary leader Lenin. But Shadov at the time didn't recognize him, and didn't even dare to think that this ordinary, short man was Lenin. He stopped him on the stairs and shouted, "Hey, comrade, where can I get some tea?" "You want to drink tea...ah?" Thus began the natural and cordial conversation between the great leader and the ordinary soldier.

    The actor playing Lenin, Diao Guangqin, not only resembled Lenin in appearance, but more importantly, he embodied the thoughts and feelings of an ordinary yet great revolutionary leader Lenin through inner truthfulness. Every conversation he had with Shadov was so kind, dignified, optimistic, and confident. Tian Chong, who played Ivan Shadov, showed a simple and kind look in his eyes, and his simple and powerful movements made people believe that Shadov was a genuine, kind, simple, and honest farmer.

    What a solemn and exciting thing this is. On the occasion of the October Revolution Day, the image of Lenin on the Chinese stage will simultaneously be active on the screen.

### “带枪的人”上银幕

    “带枪的人”上银幕
    一天中午，北京人民艺术剧院“带枪的人”的排演厅里显得比往日更加忙碌，原来是中央新闻纪录电影制片厂在为这个戏拍摄排演纪录片。
    排演厅外边，发电机??的响着。几十个俄罗斯士兵、水兵、赤卫军装束的演员，操练着整齐的步伐；在化装室里，特型化装师王希钟在饰演列宁的演员刁光覃的头上精细的塑造着列宁宽大的前额。导演欧阳山尊、夏淳在拍摄前根据电影镜头的要求，又在细致地和主要演员研究着剧本。舞台工作者和摄影师们更是忙来忙去。
    导演选择拍摄的是剧中极为重要的两场戏：一场是伊凡·雪特林在工人赤卫军契毕索夫的引导下，从为自己的“土地”和“牛”的烦恼中不自觉地走上了“征服整个世界”的革命道路，第二场是在斯莫尔尼的走廊里，雪特林与伟大的领袖列宁的会晤。
    现在第二场戏开始了：
    “噔噔噔”，从高高的楼梯上走来了一个有着宽大前额的人。他左手插在肢窝底下，微侧着头，充满胜利信心地在沉思着什么重大事情。谁都会认出这是伟大的革命领袖列宁。可是当时的雪特林他不认识、更没敢想这个个子不高的普通人就是列宁。他拦着楼梯喊：“老兄，同志，什么地方我可以得到一些茶水呢？”“你很想喝茶……啊？”这样自然亲切的开始了伟大领袖与普通士兵的谈话。
    饰演列宁的演员刁光覃，不仅外形塑造得很像，更主要的是他通过内心的真实，体现了一个普通的、同时是伟大的革命领袖列宁的思想感情。他和雪特林的每句谈话都是那么亲切、庄严、乐观、坚信。饰演伊凡·雪特林的田冲，表现出那种单纯而善良的眼神，和那种朴素有力的动作，无不使人相信雪特林是个地道的、善良淳朴而忠厚的农民。
    这是件多么庄严而令人兴奋的事情。在十月革命节的日子里，列宁在中国舞台上的形象将要同时活跃在银幕上。
