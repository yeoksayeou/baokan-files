    Going to the Most Difficult Places to Participate in Agricultural Production
    A Batch of League Cadres Set Off from Fujian and Anhui Respectively
    (Our report) Forty-four cadres who are leaving their offices to become farmers in the countryside have recently departed for forest farms and agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian to engage in productive labor. This is the first group selected by the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and its affiliated league newspaper and league school from 112 cadres who volunteered to participate in physical labor. This group of new farmers includes Zhang Yumin, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial League Committee, Zhou Tingnan, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Fujian Youth Daily, and Li Yiding, Dean of Education of the Provincial League School. Among them are 25 Communist Party members, 15 members of the Communist Youth League, and 11 female comrades. Most of them are intellectual youths who have not experienced severe class struggle and hard labor. Among them, a small number may be transferred back to work in the office after a period of physical labor training and obtaining farmer qualifications, while the majority will participate in long-term labor in the countryside.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League recently selected fifteen league cadres to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor for about a year. This group of cadres includes two department-level cadres and eight section-level cadres from the Provincial League Committee. They have already departed from Hefei for the Huaibei area on the 15th.
    On the afternoon of the 14th, more than 1,000 representatives from directly affiliated organizations, factories, enterprises, and schools in Anhui Province and Hefei City held a meeting to bid farewell to this group of cadres going to the countryside. Zeng Qingmei, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Song Menglin, Minister of the Organization Department of the Provincial Committee, both expressed their congratulations to the cadres going to the countryside in their speeches and gave instructions on the issues they should pay attention to during their labor. Wang Chuang and Zhao Ming, representatives of the cadres going to the countryside, expressed in their speeches their determination to put down the airs of intellectuals, humbly learn from the peasants, abide by discipline, and obey leadership.

    到最艰苦的地方去参加农业生产
    福建安徽一批团干部分别出发
    本报讯  四十四名从机关走向农村当农民的干部，最近已出发到闽北山区的林场和农业社去从事生产劳动。这是共青团福建省委及所属团报、团校从一百十二名报名参加体力劳动的干部中第一批抽调去的，这批新农民中，有团省委副书记张渝民，福建青年报副总编辑周挺南和省团校教育长李一丁。其中共产党员二十五人，共青团员十五人；内女同志十一人。他们多数是未经过严重的阶级斗争和艰苦劳动的知识青年。他们中间除小部分经过较长时间体力劳动锻炼，取得农民资格以后，可能调回机关工作外，大部分都将在农村参加长期的劳动。
    新华社合肥15日电  共青团安徽省委最近抽调了十五名团干部，下乡参加一年左右的农业劳动。这批干部中有团省委部长级干部二人，科长级干部八人，他们已经在15日从合肥起程前往淮北地区。
    14日下午，安徽省和合肥市直属机关、工厂、企业、学校一千多名代表为欢送这批下乡干部举行了大会。中共安徽省委书记处书记曾庆梅，省委组织部长宋孟邻在讲话中都对下乡干部们表示祝贺，并对他们在劳动中应当注意的问题作了指示。下乡干部代表王创、赵明在讲话中表示，决心放下知识分子的架子，虚心向农民学习，遵守纪律，服从领导。
