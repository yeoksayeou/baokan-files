Xinhua News Agency, November 9th – The third stage of the rectification campaign's airing of views (mingfang) in the State Planning Commission has entered its climax. Starting from the 8th, a three-level cadre symposium is being held, attended by responsible cadres from the commission, bureaus, and sections, to further promote extensive airing of views, combined with debates. From October 30th, when Director Li Fuchun made a mobilization report, until the 8th, the State Planning Commission, in addition to various bureaus holding several symposiums for airing views, has posted 802 big-character posters. The number of people posting big-character posters has reached 72% of the total number of people in the organization participating in the rectification. A total of 1,319 opinions have been raised in the big-character posters.

This round of extensive airing of views is characterized by high enthusiasm among the masses. Less than an hour and a half after Li Fuchun delivered his report, the first big-character poster was put up on the wall. That afternoon, 60 big-character posters were posted. The number increased daily thereafter. On November 4th, 146 big-character posters were posted, reaching a climax. Most responsible cadres and Party and League members wrote big-character posters. By the 8th, 64% of section and bureau chiefs had written big-character posters. Party and League members who wrote big-character posters accounted for 77% of the total number of Party and League members. Almost all of the dozens of engineers in the Planning Commission wrote big-character posters.

Most of the opinions raised in the big-character posters are related to issues concerning the work of the Planning Commission. Among them, opinions on the Five-Year Plan, the planning system and methods, and the organizational tasks of the Planning Commission account for more than 40% of the total number of opinions. This round of extensive airing of views is completely different from the situation in the first stage of the rectification campaign when rightists took the opportunity to attack the Party. Although some of the opinions raised in the big-character posters are also very sharp, they all proceed from the standpoint of improving work and improving relationships. For example, one big-character poster asked the leaders of the Planning Commission to answer: What principles were used to approve the design task book for the Jiangxi Gunny Sack Factory, and does it conform to the central government's policy of building the country diligently and thriftily? They believed that at that time, there was a shortage of raw materials, the existing equipment capacity had not yet been fully utilized, and there was no need to build a new gunny sack factory this year. Although they had repeatedly raised different opinions at the time, the leaders of the Planning Commission still approved it. Another big-character poster asked a certain bureau chief: Why do you make people feel "afraid"? The big-character poster pointed out that this bureau chief's attitude was usually blunt and he would immediately contradict people, so some comrades were unwilling to approach him. Debates have also been launched on some major issues in the big-character posters.

Currently, the State Planning Commission has established four special topic groups on the Five-Year Plan, planning system and methods, the organizational tasks and cadre issues of the Planning Commission, leadership style, political and ideological work, welfare, and administrative systems. Led by the deputy directors, these groups are conducting research separately based on the opinions raised in the big-character posters and various meetings. For smaller problems that can be solved immediately, the Planning Commission has set up a rectification column on the big-character poster wall to provide daily answers and make immediate changes where possible. For more significant issues, it is preparing to conduct special airing of views and debates soon in order to solve them thoroughly.

### 国家计委整改鸣放进入高潮  局处长和党团员带头贴大字报

    国家计委整改鸣放进入高潮
    局处长和党团员带头贴大字报
    新华社9日讯　国家计划委员会整风第三阶段鸣放已经进入高潮。从8日起开始举行委、局、处负责干部参加的三级干部座谈会，进一步大鸣大放，并结合展开争辩。从上月30日李富春主任作动员报告起，到8日为止，国家计划委员会除各局都开了几次座谈会进行鸣放以外，已经贴出大字报八百零二张。出大字报的人数已达机关参加整风人数的72％。在大字报上提出意见一千三百一十九条。
    这次大鸣大放，群众情绪很高。李富春作报告后不到一个半钟头，墙上就贴出了第一张大字报。当天下午，大字报就出到六十张。此后逐日增加。本月4日，大字报出到一百四十六张，达到高潮。大部分负责干部和党团员都写了大字报。到8日为止，处长、局长写大字报的达处局长总人数的64％。党团员写大字报的占党团员总数的77％。计委的几十个工程师，差不多全都写了大字报。
    大字报上所提的意见，大部分是有关计委工作方面的问题。其中关于五年计划、计划体制方法和计委机构任务方面的意见，占意见总条数的40％以上。这次大鸣大放和整风第一阶段右派乘机向党进攻的情况迥然不同。大字报所提意见有的虽然也很尖锐，但都是从改进工作、改进关系出发的。如有一张大字报要求计委领导上答复：批准江西麻袋厂的设计任务书是根据什么原则，是否符合中央勤俭建国的方针？他们认为当时原料不足，现有设备能力还没有全部发挥，今年不需要再新建麻袋厂。虽然当时他们就多次提出过不同的意见，但计委领导上还是批准了。又有一张大字报问某局长：你为什么使人感到“怕”？这张大字报指出这个局长平时态度生硬，张口就顶人，所以有些同志不愿意接近他。大字报对一些重大问题还展开了辩论。
    目前，国家计划委员会已经成立了关于五年计划，计划体制、方法，计委机构任务、干部问题，领导作风、政治思想工作、生活福利、行政制度等四个专题小组，由副主任亲自领导，根据大字报和各种会议上所提出的意见，分头进行研究。对于马上就能解决的比较小的问题，计委在大字报墙上辟了整改专栏，每天作答复，能立即改的就立即改。对比较重大的问题，准备不久就进行专题鸣放和辩论，以求解决得彻底。
