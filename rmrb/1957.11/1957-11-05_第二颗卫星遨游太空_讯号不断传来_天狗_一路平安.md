Xinhua News Agency, November 4th dispatch from Moscow: The entire Soviet Union is watching the flight of the new artificial Earth satellite with boundless joy and great interest. Based on preliminary measurement data of the satellite's orbital parameters, its basic orbital elements can already be determined.

The time required for the second satellite to orbit the Earth once is 103.7 minutes, which is seven and a half minutes more than the initial orbital period of the first satellite.

Despite the increase in weight of scientific and measuring instruments to more than half a ton, the second satellite still obtained a very high speed when entering orbit, which will increase its duration of existence. Due to the increase in initial velocity, the second satellite is orbiting along a higher orbit, with the farthest distance from the ground being approximately 1,700 kilometers, which is 800 kilometers higher than the orbit of the first satellite.

Ground-based radio telemetry instruments are receiving and recording data from scientific observations conducted on the satellite.

According to the International Geophysical Year program, the second artificial satellite will specifically study a series of important medical and biological problems caused by interstellar flight. To achieve this goal, a living being – an Eskimo dog – is installed in a specially designed sealed container on the satellite. The data on the dog's basic physiological functions can be recorded through special instruments.

Preliminary results of telemetry data research indicate that the dog was very calm in the early stages of flight, and its overall condition was good. The dog's physiological state is being continuously monitored. Ground-based scientific stations are also recording data from instruments studying cosmic rays and solar radiation in the short-wave, ultraviolet, and X-ray spectral bands. Scientific observation data is being accumulated and studied.

The satellite's radio station is working normally, and all radio technical equipment and radio enthusiasts participating in the observation can receive the radio station's signals at frequencies of 20 MHz and 40 MHz.

As of 6:00 AM Moscow time on November 4th, the second satellite had completed thirteen orbits around the Earth.

While observing the second satellite, the observation of the first satellite and its carrier rocket has not been stopped. As of 6:00 AM Moscow time on November 4th, the carrier rocket of the first satellite had completed 456 orbits around the Earth, and the first satellite had completed 454 orbits.

As of the evening of November 4th, the carrier rocket was leading the satellite by 1.86 orbits and will appear thirteen minutes later than the satellite.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 4th: The Eskimo dog, the first living creature to travel in space aboard the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite, has traveled at very high altitudes many times before. This was stated by Soviet Academy of Sciences Academician Blagonravov in an article published in "Pravda" when talking about the launch of the second artificial satellite.

In this article, he said that data on the condition of this living creature during space travel—breathing, heart activity, etc.—can be continuously received from the satellite's radio telemetry system. The temperature and atmospheric pressure at an altitude of approximately 1,700 kilometers are now being directly measured for the first time. He said that, therefore, the launch of the second artificial satellite has taken another step forward in solving the problem of human spaceflight.

    第二颗卫星遨游太空
    讯号不断传来  “天狗”一路平安
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联全国都以无限欣喜的心情和很大的兴趣注视着新的人造地球卫星的飞行。根据卫星运行参数的初步测量资料，已经可以确定出它的轨道的基本要素。
    第二个卫星绕地球运行一周所需时间为一○三·七分钟，比第一个卫星开始时的运行周期多七分半钟。
    尽管科学仪器和测量仪器的重量增加到半吨以上，第二个卫星在进入轨道时仍然获得了很高的速度，这样就能增加它的存在时间。由于初速度的增加，第二个卫星沿着更高的轨道运行，离地面的最远距离约为一千七百公里，也就是说，比第一个卫星的轨道高八百公里。
    地上的无线电遥测仪器正在接收和记录卫星上所进行的科学观测的资料。
    根据国际地球物理年的计划，在第二个人造卫星上特别要研究由于星际飞行而产生的一系列重要的医学生物学问题。为了实现这个目的，在卫星的特制的密封容器内装了一个生物——爱斯基摩犬。通过特别的仪器就可以把这只狗的基本生理机能的资料记录下来。
    遥测资料初步研究的结果表明，在飞行初期狗很安静，它的整个情况也是良好的。对于狗的生理状态正在继续观察中。地上的科学站也正在记录研究宇宙线和太阳在短波、紫外线和X射线光谱段辐射的仪器的资料。科学观测的资料正在积累和研究中。
    卫星的无线电站工作正常，参加观测的所有无线电技术设备和无线电爱好者都能收到这个无线电站的二十兆赫和四十兆赫频率的讯号。
    到11月4日晨莫斯科时间六点正为止，第二个卫星绕地球整整转了十三圈。
    在观测第二个卫星的同时，仍然没有停止对第一个卫星和运载火箭的观测。到11月4日晨莫斯科时间六点正为止，第一个卫星的运载火箭绕地球转了四百五十六圈，第一个卫星整整转了四百五十四圈。
    到11月4日晚运载火箭比卫星领先一点八六圈，将比卫星迟出现十三分钟。
    新华社莫斯科4日电　乘坐苏联第二个人造卫星、第一个在宇宙间遨游的活动物——爱斯基摩犬，曾经多次在很高的高空旅行过。这是苏联科学院院士布拉冈拉沃士4日在“真理报”上发表文章谈到第二个人造卫星的发射时说的。
    他在这篇文章中说，从卫星上的无线电遥测系统可以不断地收到有关这个活动物在宇宙航行中的状况——呼吸、心脏活动等等的情况报道。高约一千七百公里的高空上的温度和大气压力现在第一次得到直接测定。他说，因此，第二个人造卫星的发射使人类宇宙航行问题的解决又跨进了新的一步。
