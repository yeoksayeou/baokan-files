Xinhua News Agency, November 6th. A grand gathering was held in the capital tonight by people from all walks of life to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. More than 18,000 Chinese and foreign guests attended the celebration.

Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and G. Tikhvinsky, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, spoke at the meeting. In his speech, Liu Shaoqi emphasized the great significance of the October Revolution. He pointed out that since the great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history, the people of the world will gradually enter the historical period of socialism and communism at different times, following the basic path opened up by the October Revolution.

The grand celebration was held in the Beijing Gymnasium. The three halls of the gymnasium and the open-air sports ground in front of the hall were filled with people. The presidium was set up in the main hall of the competition hall. The national flags of China and the Soviet Union and huge portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were hung on the front of the venue. A huge slogan on the facing wall was written in Chinese and Russian: "Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!" "Long live Marxism-Leninism!" "Workers of all countries and peace-loving people of the world, unite!" "Long live the Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation!"

At 7:20 p.m., Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, and others, together with G. Tikhvinsky, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, Soviet expert representatives Sudarikov, Glebov, Kalinin, and their wives, entered the venue and ascended the rostrum. At this time, the band played a welcome song, and everyone stood up and applauded like a storm for a long time.

Also on the rostrum were Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Luo Ronghuan, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Deng Zihui, He Long, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, Nie Rongzhen, Bao Erhan, Zhang Dingcheng, Fu Zuoyi, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Yuzhang, Zhang Wentian, Kang Sheng, Lai Ruoyu, Cai Chang, Zhou Yang, Hou Debang, Liang Xi, Zhang Youyu, Liu Ren, Zheng Tianxiang, Wu Han, and Wang Kunlun.

The meeting began with the band playing the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union.

Peng Zhen, Chairman of the meeting, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Mayor of Beijing, delivered the opening speech, saying that among those invited to attend the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution in the capital are diplomatic envoys from various countries to China, Soviet experts in Beijing and other distinguished guests. Originally, a delegation from all walks of life in the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Andreyev was to attend the 40th anniversary of the Chinese people's celebration of the great October Socialist Revolution from afar, but they will not arrive until tomorrow due to weather conditions. We extend our warm welcome and gratitude to them. Peng Zhen congratulated the Soviet people on the great victories they have achieved in economic and cultural construction, and congratulated the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and people on the great victories they have achieved in the cause of defending world peace, and congratulated the unity and strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the development of the unbreakable and profound friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

Liu Shaoqi delivered a long speech at the meeting, in which he profoundly expounded the important significance of the great October Revolution, pointing out that this festival is the common festival of the working class, working people, oppressed nations, and all progressive humanity in the world. Liu Shaoqi then talked about the tremendous changes in the world situation in the forty years since the October Revolution. In the past forty years, the powerful Soviet Union has become the strongest fortress for defending world peace; socialism has won victories in a series of countries in Europe and Asia, and the consolidated, united, and growing socialist camp has become a decisive factor in the world situation; the independence and liberation movements of oppressed nations all over the world have developed unprecedentedly and widely, and have become a huge world force; the workers' movement in the capitalist world has also made great progress under the leadership of the Communist Parties of various countries. The forty years since the October Revolution have been forty years of the decline of capitalism and imperialism, forty years of the rise of socialism, forty years of the rise of the proletarian revolutionary movement and the national liberation movement, forty years of the widespread development of the world peace movement, and forty years that have made the progressive people of the world rejoice and be full of confidence. Liu Shaoqi pointed out that the changes in the world situation in the forty years since the October Revolution have demonstrated the development path of the entire human history, and the glorious future of human history opened up by the October Revolution is infinitely great.

When talking about the relationship between the October Revolution and the Chinese Revolution, Liu Shaoqi once again emphasized that the Chinese Revolution is the continuation of the great October Revolution. He pointed out that the goal of the Chinese Revolution, like that of the October Revolution, is to establish a socialist and communist society, and the historical task of China throughout the transition period is to thoroughly complete the socialist revolution on both the economic and political-ideological fronts.

Liu Shaoqi refuted the various reactionary arguments of the bourgeois rightists and expounded some fundamental issues concerning China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. He said that the forty years of Soviet history, the practical experience of the Chinese Revolution, and the experience of other socialist countries have all proved that the basic path of the October Revolution is the only correct path. Only under the dictatorship of the proletariat, only when the proletariat, through its vanguard, the Communist Party, realizes the leadership of the state power and the broad masses of the people, can the task of the socialist revolution be thoroughly completed. The rightists' opposition to the Communist Party and the dictatorship of the proletariat is opposition to socialism and the fundamental interests of the Chinese people.

Liu Shaoqi said that Marxism-Leninism is the world view of the proletariat, the science of the laws of development of nature and society, and the science of socialist revolution and the construction of socialism and communism. Therefore, those who oppose socialism always oppose Marxism-Leninism. The rightists' opposition to dogmatism is actually opposition to Marxism-Leninism itself, and they want to replace Marxism-Leninism with bourgeois ideology to guide our national life in order to restore capitalism. In the revolutionary ranks, there are also some people who, under the pretext of opposing dogmatism, use bourgeois viewpoints to "revise" the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, and this revisionist tendency is the main danger of the current period. We must resolutely oppose the tendency of revisionism while overcoming dogmatism.

Liu Shaoqi said that the system of people's congresses implemented in our country is also a state system of the same type as the Soviets, and it is also the most extensive socialist democratic system in history. The ongoing rectification movement in our country, which adopts the forms of full airing of views, free airing of views, great debates, big-character posters, seminars, and debates, is a good form of socialist democratic life in our country and an important development of socialist democracy in our country.

In his speech, Liu Shaoqi called for the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily and striving hard in the cause of socialist construction in our country, and should insist on learning from the Soviet Union. Liu Shaoqi also talked about the unbreakable great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. He pointed out that in the lofty cause of safeguarding world peace and promoting human progress, the Chinese people resolutely and forever stand on the same front with the Soviet people.

In his speech, G. Tikhvinsky, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy, on behalf of the Soviet people, expressed deep brotherly respect to their best friends and brothers, the great Chinese people.

G. Tikhvinsky spoke about the great victories achieved by the Soviet people after forty years of arduous struggle. He said that since its birth, the Soviet state has had to wage a tenacious struggle against enemies at home and abroad. In this struggle, the Communist Party and the socialist state of workers and peasants under the leadership of the great Lenin relied on the collective revolutionary heroism of the Soviet people and relied on the solidarity of the working people of the world and their fraternal support to defend the victorious fruits of the great October Revolution.

G. Tikhvinsky said: "In the years of several five-year plans, our country, thanks to the enthusiastic labor of the people, has been transformed from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country that is fully capable of rapidly developing its economy and culture and defending against aggression."

In his speech, G. Tikhvinsky particularly emphasized the great significance of the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples for the achievements of peace and socialism. He said: "This eternal, unbreakable, fraternal friendship is the greatest and most historically significant achievement won by the people of our two countries. It has deep historical roots and a solid foundation."

G. Tikhvinsky said enthusiastically that the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples was born in the flames of the October Revolution. Today, the Soviet people want to shout: "Glory to the 30,000 Chinese soldiers who directly participated in the October Revolution and defended the young Soviet Republic with arms!"

G. Tikhvinsky said that the Soviet people are sincerely delighted with the remarkable achievements made by the Chinese people in the cause of socialist construction. He said that they have personally seen the face of China change. He finally wished the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party new victories in the great cause of socialist construction.

The speeches of Liu Shaoqi and G. Tikhvinsky were received with extremely warm welcome. During their speeches, the venue was constantly filled with stormy applause. After their speeches, the band played the solemn Internationale.

Afterwards, the meeting took a 20-minute break. During the break, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, and others, together with Chargé d'Affaires ad interim G. Tikhvinsky and Soviet expert representatives Sudarikov, Glebov, and Kalinin, met with people from all walks of life in the capital in the swimming pool and training hall. Wherever they went, it became the center of joy.

After the break, a grand celebration party was held. Chinese and Soviet artists performed wonderful Chinese and Soviet music and dances in the competition hall, and Chinese athletes gave wonderful performances of table tennis, volleyball, swimming, diving, and water polo in the training hall and swimming pool. The entire gymnasium was filled with joy and songs and dances everywhere. Before the meeting, various sports performances were held on the sports ground in front of the gymnasium.

A total of more than 2,600 foreign guests attended the celebration. Among them were the ballet troupe of the Novosibirsk State Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Soviet Union and the Soviet film, national education, and surveying and mapping delegations and well-known Soviet social figures who were visiting Beijing, Soviet experts who were helping with our country's construction and experts from various countries, diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China, and delegations and well-known figures from various countries who were paying friendly visits to our country.

Also attending today's celebration were the heads of various departments of our country's state organs, members of the CPC Central Committee, alternate members of the Central Committee, and heads of various departments, heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, representatives of the National People's Congress and members of the CPPCC, as well as the heads of various units in Beijing, people from all walks of life, and representatives of people from all walks of life.

    首都举行盛大庆祝会
    刘少奇和顾悌克夫先后在会上讲了话
    新华社6日讯　首都各界今天晚间举行规模盛大的集会，隆重地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。出席庆祝大会的中外人士有一万八千多人。
    中共中央副主席、全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长刘少奇和苏联驻中国大使馆临时代办顾悌克夫在大会上讲了话。刘少奇在讲话中强调了十月革命的伟大意义。他指出，自从伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟了人类历史新纪元以后，全世界的人民都将在先后不同的时间内，沿着十月革命所开辟的基本道路，逐步进入社会主义和共产主义的历史时期。
    这个盛大的庆祝大会在北京体育馆举行。在体育馆三个大厅和馆前的露天运动场上都坐满了人。大会主席台设在比赛馆的大厅里。会场的正面悬挂着中苏两国的国旗和马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的巨幅画像。迎面墙壁上的巨大标语上用中俄文写着：“伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！”“马克思列宁主义万岁！”“全世界无产者和爱好和平的人民联合起来！”“中苏友好合作万岁！”
    七时二十分，刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、陈云、彭真等同苏联驻中国大使馆临时代办顾悌克夫，苏联专家代表苏达利科夫、格列波夫、加里宁等和他们的夫人一起步入会场，登上主席台。这时，乐队奏起欢迎曲，人们全体起立，暴风雨般的掌声经久不息。
    在大会主席台上还有林伯渠、李济深、罗荣桓、沈钧儒、黄炎培、陈叔通、邓子恢、贺龙、陈毅、李富春、聂荣臻、包尔汉、张鼎丞、傅作义、张治中、吴玉章、张闻天、康生、赖若愚、蔡畅、周扬、侯德榜、梁希、张友渔、刘仁、郑天翔、吴晗、王昆仑。
    大会开始，乐队奏中国和苏联两国国歌。
    大会主席、中共中央政治局委员、北京市市长彭真致开会词说，今天应邀参加我们首都各界庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年大会的有各国驻我国的使节，和在北京的苏联专家及其他贵宾们，本来还有远道而来的以安德烈耶夫同志为首的苏联各界参加中国人民庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念的代表团，因为气候关系，明日才能赶来。我们对他们表示热烈的欢迎和感谢。彭真祝贺苏联人民在经济和文化建设事业中所取得的伟大胜利，祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的国家和人民在保卫世界和平的事业中所取得的伟大胜利，祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结与强盛和中苏两国的牢不可破的深厚友谊的发展。
    刘少奇在会上发表了长篇讲话，他深刻地阐述了伟大十月革命的重要意义，指出这个节日是全世界的工人阶级、劳动人民、被压迫民族和一切进步人类的共同节日。刘少奇接着谈到了十月革命四十年来世界形势的巨大变化。四十年来，强大的苏联已经成为捍卫世界和平的最坚强的堡垒；社会主义又在欧洲和亚洲一系列国家中取得了胜利，巩固团结和日益壮大的社会主义阵营已经成为世界局势的决定因素；全世界被压迫民族的独立解放运动有了空前广泛的发展，已经成为一种巨大的世界力量；资本主义世界的工人运动，也在各国共产党的领导下有了很大发展。十月革命以来的四十年，是资本主义和帝国主义走向没落的四十年，是社会主义上升的四十年，是无产阶级革命运动和民族解放运动上升的四十年，是世界和平运动广泛发展的四十年，是使得世界进步人类欢欣鼓舞和充满信心的四十年。刘少奇指出，十月革命四十年来世界形势的变化展现了整个人类历史的发展道路，十月革命所开辟的人类历史的光辉前途是无限伟大的。
    刘少奇在谈到十月革命与中国革命的关系时，再次强调中国革命是伟大十月革命的继续。他指出中国革命的目标同十月革命一样是要建立社会主义和共产主义社会，中国在整个过渡时期的历史任务就是要在经济战线和政治思想战线上同时彻底地完成社会主义革命。
    刘少奇驳斥了资产阶级右派分子的种种反动论点，阐述了有关中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一些根本问题。他说，四十年来的苏联历史，中国革命的实践经验，以及其他社会主义国家的经验，都证明了十月革命的基本道路是唯一正确的道路。只有在无产阶级专政的条件下，只有无产阶级通过它的先锋队共产党实现了对于国家政权和广大人民群众的领导，才能彻底完成社会主义革命的任务。右派分子反对共产党，反对无产阶级专政，就是反对社会主义，反对中国人民的根本利益。
    刘少奇说，马克思列宁主义是无产阶级的世界观，是关于自然界和社会的发展规律的科学，是关于社会主义革命、关于建设社会主义和共产主义的科学。所以反对社会主义的人总是要反对马克思列宁主义。右派分子反对教条主义，其实就是反对马克思列宁主义本身，是想拿资产阶级思想代替马克思列宁主义来指导我们的国家生活，以便使资本主义复辟。在革命队伍中间，也有一些人借口反对教条主义，用资产阶级观点来“修正”马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，这种修正主义倾向是目前时期的主要危险。我们必须在克服教条主义的同时，坚决地反对修正主义的倾向。
    刘少奇说，在我国实行的人民代表大会制度，也是和苏维埃同一类型的国家制度，也是历史上最广泛的社会主义的民主制度。当前我国正在进行着的全民整风运动，采取了大鸣、大放、大辩论，出大字报，开座谈会、辩论会等等形式，这是我国社会主义民主生活的一种很好的形式，是我国社会主义民主的重要发展。
    刘少奇在讲话中号召在我国的社会主义建设事业中，应当提倡勤俭建国、艰苦奋斗的精神，应当坚持向苏联学习。刘少奇还谈到了中苏两国人民牢不可破的伟大友谊。他指出，在维护世界和平、促进人类进步的崇高事业中，中国人民坚决地永远地同苏联人民站在一条战线上。
    苏联大使馆临时代办顾悌克夫在讲话时代表苏联人民向自己最好的朋友和兄弟、向伟大的中国人民，表示深切的兄弟般的敬意。
    顾悌克夫谈到苏联人民经过四十年艰苦的斗争所取得的伟大胜利。他说，苏维埃国家从诞生之日起，就不得不同内外的敌人进行顽强的斗争。在这个斗争中，共产党和伟大的列宁领导下的工农社会主义国家，依靠着苏联人民群众的集体的革命英雄主义，依靠着同全世界劳动人民的团结和他们兄弟般的支持，保卫住了伟大的十月革命的胜利果实。
    顾悌克夫说：“在几个五年计划的年代里，我们的国家由于人民的热情的劳动，已经由落后的农业国变成了完全能够迅速地发展经济和文化、能够防御侵略的强大工业国。”
    顾悌克夫在讲话中特别强调苏中两国人民的友谊对于和平和社会主义事业的成就的巨大意义。他说：“这种永恒的、牢不可破的、兄弟般的友谊，是我们两国人民争取到的最伟大的、具有历史意义的成就，它有着深厚的历史根源和牢固的基础。”
    顾悌克夫热情地说，苏中两国人民的友谊是在十月革命烽火中产生的。今天苏联人民要高呼：“手持武器直接参加十月革命和保卫年轻的苏维埃共和国的三万中国战士光荣不朽！”
    顾悌克夫说，苏联人民衷心地为中国人民在社会主义建设的事业中所取得的卓越成就而欢欣鼓舞。他说，他们亲眼看到中国的面貌改变了。他最后祝中国人民和中国共产党在社会主义建设的伟大事业中获得新的胜利。
    刘少奇和顾悌克夫的讲话，受到了极其热烈的欢迎。在他们讲话的过程中，会场不断响起暴风雨般的掌声。他们讲话结束以后，乐队奏起了庄严的国际歌。
    随后，大会休息二十分钟。在休息的时候，刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、陈云、彭真等同顾悌克夫临时代办和苏联专家代表苏达利科夫、格列波夫、加里宁一起，到游泳馆、练习馆同首都各界人民会见。他们走到那里，那里就成了欢乐的中心。
    休息以后，接着举行了盛大的庆祝晚会。中苏两国艺术家在比赛馆表演了精采的中苏音乐和歌舞，中国的运动员们分别在练习馆和游泳馆举行了乒乓球、排球、游泳、跳水和水球的精采表演。整个体育馆内处处欢乐，到处歌舞。在大会以前，在体育馆前面的运动场上举行了各种体育表演。
    参加庆祝大会的外宾共有两千六百多人。他们当中有正在北京访问的苏联国立新西伯利亚歌舞剧院芭蕾舞团和苏联电影、国民教育、测绘等代表团和苏联著名的社会人士，有帮助我国建设的苏联专家和各国的专家，有各国驻中国的使节和外交官员，还有在我国进行友好访问的各国代表团和著名人士。
    参加今天庆祝大会的，还有我国国家机关各部门的负责人，中共中央委员、中央候补委员和各部的负责人，各民主党派和各人民团体的负责人，中国人民解放军的高级将领，人民代表大会代表和政协委员，以及北京市各单位的负责人，社会各界人士和各界人民的代表。
