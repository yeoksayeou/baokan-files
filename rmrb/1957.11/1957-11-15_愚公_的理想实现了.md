"Yu Gong's" Ideal Realized
    Hu Guolin Li Chuanqing
    The people of Wangwu Township, Jiyuan, with the persevering spirit of Yu Gong removing mountains, built five reservoirs, hundreds of water wells and cellars in one year with a burst of energy, turning 7,166 mu of terraced fields into irrigated land. They achieved a great agricultural harvest for the whole year, creating a miracle of more than 2,000 jin per mu on high-yield land.
    Wangwu Township, located in the Taihang Mountains, 800 meters above sea level, is named after its location at Wangwu Mountain. The story of "Yu Gong Removing Mountains" in the ancient book Liezi took place here. The entire area is characterized by high mountains and steep slopes, often experiencing "water flowing away when it rains, and burning like fire during droughts." Some farmers had to climb mountains and ridges to fetch water from mountain gullies several miles away, often experiencing "nine droughts in ten years, and disasters in every season." In the two consecutive years of severe drought, 1942 and 1943, the harvests were poor, and 80% of the local people fled to other places. Most of the farmers in Wangwu Village fled the famine, leaving only a few landlords and local bullies. The people's lives were extremely impoverished. Therefore, there was a saying in the local area: "Burning yellow wormwood, singeing thorny bushes, no girl will marry into Wangwu Village." Building water conservancy projects was a long-cherished dream of the masses.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the people of Wangwu Township rapidly restored production, but they did not pay enough attention to the construction of water conservancy projects, only carrying out some temporary, low-quality dry wells and terraced fields, lacking fundamental long-term plans. The advent of cooperativization and the promulgation of the Draft National Agricultural Development Program opened up broad avenues for production in mountainous areas. In the winter of 1955, Jiyuan County launched a water conservancy movement. When various places were enthusiastically engaged in digging wells, digging canals, and building reservoirs, the masses in Wangwu Township were also brewing the idea: "How wonderful it would be if we could build a reservoir here!"
    Last spring, the Wangwu Township Party Branch, based on the instructions of the higher Party Committee and the demands of the masses, decided to launch a water conservancy movement after investigation and research. The masses actively supported this decision, but because it was very difficult to carry out water conservancy projects in the high mountains and there was no experience, their determination was not great and their confidence was not high. Some Party members and cadres also wavered. In response to this situation, the Wangwu Township Party Branch specifically studied how to mobilize the masses. On the basis of ideological armament, the branch committee members were assigned responsibilities to carry out propaganda and education among the broad masses on the great significance of water conservancy construction for developing agricultural production, supporting national construction, and improving the lives of people in mountainous areas. They also loudly proposed the slogan: "The former Yu Gong could move mountains, we can carry out water conservancy!" In order to more effectively mobilize the masses, in addition to guiding the masses to recall the great drought disasters in history, each agricultural cooperative also organized the masses to conduct on-site visits, calculate the increased production benefits of water conservancy, and carry out key experiments. The enthusiasm of the masses for engaging in water conservancy construction was enhanced, and more than 80% of the labor force was invested in the movement to build water wells, dig water cellars, and build reservoirs. More than 2,000 laborers from the whole township participated in digging water wells, digging water cellars, and building reservoirs every day. After three months of struggle, the Erliqiao Reservoir, which was more than 100 meters long, was completed. Subsequently, the Taohuadong and Guogou Reservoirs were also successively established, and a mass cellar construction movement emerged at the same time. From March of last year to the spring of this year, within one year, the township built five reservoirs in one go, twenty canals leading from ditches and rivers, built five hundred and ninety-four water cellars, and dug one hundred and forty-two water wells. The area of irrigated land in the township expanded to more than 7,000 mu. With water and sufficient fertilizer in the mountainous area, a great harvest was obtained last year, with a 30% increase in production compared to 1955. More than 400,000 jin more surplus grain was sold than last year. Even more gratifying was that in the autumn, 389 mu of high-yield land appeared in the township, with a general yield of about 1,000 jin per mu, and a yield of 2,030 jin per mu in some cases. With the increase in production, the average income of cooperative members was 47 yuan, exceeding the living standards of the average middle peasant in the local area before the war. The masses generally reflected: "Water conservancy is really effective, with the leadership of the Communist Party and the support of the cooperative, who says that water cannot be drawn to high mountains and dry land cannot produce a bumper harvest!"
    From July 25th to the end of October this year, although it did not rain for three months, due to the effectiveness of the water conservancy projects, the township still completed the wheat sowing task of 14,000 mu on time. It is estimated that drought-resistant wheat planting can increase production by at least 800,000 jin compared to conditions without water conservancy. The cooperative members said: "Eight big oxen pulling cannot pull me out of the cooperative."
    The promulgation of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program has further encouraged the production enthusiasm of the people of Wangwu Township. In order to implement the requirements of the provincial water conservancy conference, Wangwu Township is launching a socialist production and construction upsurge centered on water conservancy construction. They plan, on the existing basis, to make efforts for another two years to realize water conservancy in the whole township (that is, to realize water conservancy in 9,500 mu of farmland), and 7,800 mu of "semi-water conservancy" (with fields and cellars, one cellar per mu). By 1959, all the land in the township can be guaranteed to be planted and harvested, and the income of cooperative members will exceed the living standards of local wealthy middle peasants. By the end of the second Five-Year Plan, the township's yield per mu will reach 400 jin, and the targets of the National Agricultural Production Program can be achieved five years ahead of schedule.

    “愚公”的理想实现了
    胡国林　李传清
    济源王屋乡人民以愚公移山的坚毅精神，在一年时间内，一股劲修建了五座水库、数百眼水井和水窖，使七千一百六十六亩梯田变成了水浇地。获得了全年农业大丰收，创造了丰产地亩产二千多斤的奇迹。
    王屋乡，位于太行山中，拔海八百公尺，因地处王屋山而得名。古书列子里“愚公移山”的故事，就发生在这里。全境山高坡陡，常是“下雨水流走，天旱似火烧”。有些农民吃水需要爬山越岭，到数里以外的山沟里去取，经常是“十年九旱，季季有灾”。1942、1943两年连年大旱，五谷歉收，当地80％的人出外逃生。王屋村绝大部分农民逃了荒，只剩下几户地主恶霸。群众生活贫困不堪。因此当地有“烧黄蒿、燎圪针，有姑娘不嫁王屋村”之说。兴修水利，是群众多年梦寐以求的理想。
    解放后，王屋乡人民在党和人民政府的领导下，迅速恢复了生产，但在兴建水利方面，却重视不够，只是搞了些临时性的、质量不高的旱井和梯田，缺乏根本性的长远打算。合作化的到来和全国农业发展纲要草案的公布，给山区生产开辟了广阔的道路，1955年冬，济源全县开展了水利化运动，当各地热火朝天地进行打井、挖渠、修建水库的时候，王屋乡群众也在酝酿着：“咱这儿要能修水库多好！”
    去年春，中共王屋乡支部根据上级党委指示和群众的要求，经过调查研究，决定开展水利化运动。群众对这一决定积极拥护，但因在高山上搞水利困难很多，又无经验，因而决心不大，信心不高。部分党员、干部也发生了动摇。针对这一情况，王屋乡党支部专门研究了如何发动群众问题，在武装思想的基础上，支委分工负责，向广大群众进行了水利建设对发展农业生产、支援国家建设、改善山区人民生活的重大意义的宣传教育。并响亮提出：“前代愚公能移山，我们能水利化”的口号。为了更有效地发动群众，各个农业社除诱导群众回忆了历史上的大旱灾情外，还组织群众实地参观，算水利增产账，进行了重点试验。群众从事水利建设的积极性提高了，80％以上的劳力投入了兴修水利的运动。全乡每天有二千多劳力参加打水井、挖水窖、修水库。经过三个月的斗争，长达百余公尺的二里桥水库竣工了。接着桃花洞和郭沟水库也相继建立起来，同时出现了群众性的筑窖运动。从去年3月至今年春天一年时间内，该乡一股劲修起了五座水库，沟河引渠二十条，筑水窖五百九十四个，打水井一百四十二眼。全乡水浇地的面积扩大到七千多亩。有了水，加上山区肥足，去年获得了大丰收，比1955年增产三成。余粮比去年多卖了四十余万斤。更喜人的是：秋季全乡出现了三百八十九亩丰产地，一般亩产千斤左右，多者亩产二千零三十斤。随着生产的增加，社员每人平均收入四十七元，超过了当地战前一般中农的生活水平。群众普遍反映：“水利真管事，有共产党来领导，有合作社作依靠，谁说高山不能引水，旱地不能丰产！”
    今年7月25日到10月底，虽然三个月时间没下雨，由于发挥了水利工程的效能，该乡依然按时完成了一万四千亩的麦播任务，预计比没有水利的条件下抗旱种麦，至少可增产八十余万斤。社员们说：“八个大牛拉也不能把我拉出社。”
    农业发展纲要修正草案的公布，进一步鼓舞了王屋乡群众的生产积极性。为了贯彻省水利会议的要求，王屋乡正在掀起一个以水利建设为中心的社会主义生产建设高潮，他们打算在现有基础上，再经两年时间的努力，使全乡水利化（即使九千五百亩田地水利化），七千八百亩“半水利化”（有田有窖，一亩一窖）。到1959年，全乡土地可保种保收，社员收入超过当地富裕中农的生活水平。到第二个五年计划末了，全乡亩产达到四百斤，可提前五年实现全国发展农业生产纲要的指标。
