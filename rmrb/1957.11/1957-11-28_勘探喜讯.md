Exploration Good News

    Guangdong Province is Covered in Gold
    Guangdong is a province covered in gold. The newly discovered four gold mines have staggering reserves: 帽峰山 in Zengcheng, with gold reserves of about 137,000 taels; 挡山 in Kaijian County, with gold reserves of about 13 million taels; Lianzhou Township in Luoding, with gold reserves of about 100,000 taels; and 木? Township in Lianshan, with gold reserves of about 57,000 taels. A total of 103 places with proven gold mines have been confirmed in the province, distributed in 46 counties.
    Relevant departments have decided to mine gold on a large scale next year.

    Red River Area Rich in Gold Mines
    After more than half a year of geological survey, it has been proven that the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province is rich in gold mines. There are placer gold mines in the river valleys of the Jinhe River, Jinping River, and Madian River in Jinping County within the autonomous prefecture. In these river valleys, some places have a gold content of up to three grams per cubic meter. The survey team also discovered ancient glacial alluvial gold deposits and vein gold mines with the richest gold content in Jinping and Yuanyang counties. These placer gold mines and vein gold mines have been proven to be of mining value.

    Mount Wutai Area Hides Much Gold
    Shanxi Province is rich in gold reserves, and it has been discovered that the Wutai Mountains and Zhongtiao Mountains areas have gold. Among them, there are 24 gold producing areas in the counties of Wutai, Daixian, and Fanshi in the Wutai Mountains area, with a distribution range of about 80 kilometers from east to west and about 20 kilometers from north to south, with extremely rich reserves. In the winter of 1955, a farmer in Daixian picked up a ten-tael piece of gold on the way while collecting manure.
    There are a total of 33 gold producing areas in the Zhongtiao Mountains area in Pinglu, Yuanqu, Jiangxian, Xiaxian, Wenxi and other places, of which 10 are extremely rich in gold, with a distribution range of about 150 kilometers from east to west and about 50 kilometers from north to south.
    The masses in Shanxi Province have long had the habit of gold mining. Recently, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee convened a provincial gold production meeting, researched and determined the policy of developing gold production to "produce and explore at the same time," conducting exploration in different zones while organizing agricultural cooperatives and handicraft gold production cooperatives to carry out production.

    广东省黄金遍地
    广东是一个黄金遍地的省份。新近发现的四个金矿，储量相当惊人：增城的帽峰山，储金量约十三万七千两；开建县的挡山，储金量约一千三百万两；罗定的连州乡，储金量约十万两；连山的木?乡，储金量约五万七千两。全省已经证实有金矿的地方共一百零三处，分布在四十六个县内。
    有关部门已经决定明年大量开采黄金。
    红河地区金矿丰富
    经过半年多的地质普查证明，云南省红河哈尼族彝族自治州境内蕴藏着丰富的金矿。在自治州内金平县的金河、金平河和马店河的河谷地带都有沙金矿。在这些河谷地带，有的地方每立方公尺含金量高达三克。普查队还在金平、元阳两县发现了含金量最富的古代冰川冲积金矿矿床和脉金矿。这些沙金矿和脉金矿已被证明都有开采价值。

    五台山区藏金多
    山西省黄金蕴藏丰富，目前已经发现五台山和中条山一带都有黄金。其中五台山区的五台、代县，繁峙等县有黄金产地二十四处，分布范围东西长约八十公里，南北宽约二十公里，藏量极为丰富。1955年冬，代县有个农民拾粪时，曾在途中拾得十两重的黄金一块。
    在中条山区一带的平陆、垣曲、绛县、夏县、闻喜等地共有产金区三十三处，其中有十处含金极富，分布范围东西长约一百五十公里，南北宽约五十公里。
    山西省群众早有采金习惯。最近，山西省人民委员会召开了全省黄金生产会议，研究和确定了发展黄金生产要“边生产，边勘探”的方针，一边分区进行勘探，一边组织农业合作社和手工业黄金生产合作社进行生产。
