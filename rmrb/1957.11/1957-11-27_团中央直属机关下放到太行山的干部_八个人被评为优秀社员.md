    Xinhua News Agency — Eight cadres from organizations directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League who went to the Taihang Mountains to participate in physical labor were recently named outstanding commune members in the Hongxing and Wuyi Agricultural Cooperatives in Yangwei Township, Pingshun County.
    These eight cadres arrived at the Hongxing and Wuyi Agricultural Cooperatives from Beijing at the end of September. They ate, lived, and worked alongside the peasants, and were praised by the commune members more than once. During the annual general assessment of the two cooperatives recently, the cooperative cadres and members summarized their five strengths: high attendance rate; good work ethic; humbly learning from experienced farmers; actively offering rational suggestions; and good at uniting with the masses. Based on these strengths, the agricultural cooperatives selected these eight individuals as "outstanding commune members."
    In the thirty-one days these eight cadres formally participated in agricultural cooperative labor, each of them attended work for twenty-eight to twenty-nine days, excluding meetings, which is one to two days more than the average commune member. They asked questions when they didn't understand during labor, and learned a lot of production knowledge from the commune members. Over the past month, they also put forward more than ten suggestions for the cooperative. Su Yan, who was originally working on basic construction at the Central Youth League School, inspected the terrain on the river beach and conducted measurements. He suggested that the cooperative modify the river channel, which resulted in a saving of three hundred workdays and made irrigation more convenient than before.
    They also frequently used their spare time to help commune members carry water, operate the millstone, and take care of household chores, which made them very popular among the commune members.

    团中央直属机关下放到太行山的干部
    八个人被评为优秀社员
    新华社讯　由共青团中央直属机关来到太行山区参加体力劳动的八个干部，最近在平顺县杨威乡红星、五一两个农业社被评为优秀社员。
    这八个干部9月底从北京到红星、五一农业社以后，和农民们同吃、同住、同劳动，不只一次地受到社员们的赞扬。最近这两个社进行全年总评比时，社干部和社员们给他们总结出五个优点：出勤率高；吃苦精神好；虚心向老农学习；积极提合理化建议；团结群众好。根据这些优点，农业社评选他们八个人为“优秀社员”。
    这八个干部在正式参加农业社劳动的三十一天里，除了参加会议外，每人出勤二十八天到二十九天，比一般社员多出勤一天到两天。他们在劳动中不懂就问，向社员们学会了不少生产知识。他们一个月来还给社里提出了十多条建议。原来在中央团校担任基本建设工作的苏彦，在河滩上看了地势、进行了测量，建议社里把河渠改一下，结果节省了三百个工，上水浇地比原来方便。
    他们还经常利用休息时间帮助社员们挑水、推碾，料理家事，很受社员们的欢迎。
