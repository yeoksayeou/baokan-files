The Ministry of Chemical Industry's some bureaus and departments are not performing well in improvement work. This is mainly manifested in three aspects: First, what could be changed immediately was not changed immediately; second, the changes were perfunctory and simple, only pursuing quantity, with half-baked results; third, it remained at the stage of research in meetings, without actual action to change. Judging from the number of changes made recently, the Personnel Department only made thirteen changes from October 27 to November 11, the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau did not make a single change from November 2 to November 11, and the Technology Department did not make changes that could have been made immediately. For example, the masses suggested that "the decisions of the Technical Committee should be made known to relevant departments." This matter could have been resolved by telling the secretary of the Technical Committee to do so in the future, but it was not done. For example, issues such as "who should copy the informal letters" and the noisy sounds in the office could be resolved with a discussion among the masses and some regulations, but they were not resolved in a timely manner. The quality of changes in some units is very poor. For example, the Preparatory Office of the Chemical Research Institute has changed 301 items, but some of the problems were handled with simple replies to the masses such as "pay attention in the future" or "improve in the future," without specific analysis and research on the key issues, the causes of the problems, and how to solve them thoroughly in the future. For example, the masses suggested that Director Liang Po and the trade union organization should not have approved the subsidy of 70 yuan applied for by Comrade Zhang Mujie, because Zhang's economic situation was not difficult at the time. Regarding this criticism, the leadership only said "pay attention in the future," without finding out the reason for the improper subsidy, what responsibility the leadership should bear, what responsibility the individual should bear, how to deal with it, and what measures should be formulated to improve this work in the future. For example, the masses suggested that "the cement platform in the balance room of the building is too low." The reply from the Capital Construction Section was "consider it for future improvement." This reply is very vague and irresponsible. Does it mean raising the cement platform, or only considering it when building a new balance room? What is even more noteworthy is that the Chemical Research Institute is carrying out rectification on the one hand, and serious waste is occurring on the other. The cables and electric fans purchased from Shenyang on October 15 were actually transported to Beijing by plane, costing 1,200 yuan in transportation fees. In fact, these things were not urgently needed, so the masses had great opinions. Because the institute's improvement efforts were weak, the masses posted big-character posters to criticize and demand that the leadership make bold, thorough, and resolute changes.

    Some units only study improvements in meetings, but there is no actual action to change, remaining at the level of words and writing. Therefore, some of the masses reflected: "The rectification now is a bit like a big thunder, but little rain." Some also said: "I don't feel the atmosphere of change now."

    Based on the above situation, Minister Peng Tao convened a meeting of the heads of the leading groups of various units and decided that leaders at all levels should pay a hundredfold attention and be determined to rectify. Leading cadres, especially the directors and deputy directors of bureaus, should take the lead in resolutely overcoming the phenomenon of ineffective rectification. Another upsurge of rectification for one to two weeks will be launched. (Ding Lizhi)

### 化工部部分司局改进不力  领导上决心掀起整改高潮

    化工部部分司局改进不力  领导上决心掀起整改高潮
    本报讯　化工部部分司局改进工作表现不力。主要表现在三个方面：第一是能立即改的未立即改；第二是改的潦草简单，只求数量，有夹生现象；第三停留于会议上的研究，而没实际改的行动。从最近改的数量上看，人事司从10月27日到11月11日只改了十三条，医药工业管理局从11月2日到11月11日一条也未改，技术司可以立即改的也没有改。如群众提出“技术委员会的决议应让有关部门知道”，本来这件事告诉技委会秘书今后照办即可，但也未作。又如群众提出“便函由谁抄写”的问题，办公室内吵闹声音嘈杂的问题，这些事经过群众一讨论，规定一下即可解决，但也未及时解决。有些单位改的质量很差，如化工研究院筹备处已改三百零一条，但其中有些问题的处理只是简单地答复群众“今后注意”或“今后改进”，而对问题的关键、形成问题的原因以及今后怎么办，都没有具体分析研究，彻底解决。如群众提出梁坡所长及工会组织不应该批准张慕洁同志申请的补助金七十元，因为张当时经济情况并不困难。对于这个批评，领导上只是说“今后注意”，并没有找出补助不当的原因，领导上应负什么责任，本人应负什么责任，怎么处理，今后制定什么办法来改进这项工作等等。又如群众提出，“大楼中天秤间的水泥台子太低”，基建科的答复是“作为今后改进”，这种答复很含糊，不负责，究竟是加高水泥台子呢？还是另建天秤室时才考虑呢？更加值得引起注意的是，化工研究院一方面在整风，一方面又发生严重浪费现象。10月15日从沈阳采购的电缆、电风机，竟用飞机运来北京，花运费一千二百元，实际这种东西并不是急用的，因而群众意见很大。由于该院改进不力，群众又贴出大字报提出批评，要求领导大胆地改，彻底地改，坚决地改。
    还有些单位只是会议研究改进，而没有实际改的行动，停留在口头上和文字上。因此有的群众反映：“现在整改有点雷声大，雨点小。”也有的说：“现在感觉不到改的气氛”。
    根据上述情况，部长彭涛召开了各单位领导小组长会议决定各级领导要百倍重视，决心整改。由领导干部首先是司局长带头，坚决克服整改不力的现象。再掀起一个一周到两周的整改高潮。	　（丁力芝）
