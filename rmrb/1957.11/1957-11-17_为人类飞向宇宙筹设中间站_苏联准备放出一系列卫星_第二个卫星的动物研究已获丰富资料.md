Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: TASS reported: The Moscow Comprehensive Technical Museum held an evening event on the 15th regarding the second artificial Earth satellite. Soviet scientists spoke at the event.

Ginzburg, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said: In the next few years, the ancient planet Earth, in addition to its old satellite, the Moon, will have a series of satellites – laboratories, which will become an intermediate station for humans to fly to the universe in the future. In the future, scientists can use artificial satellites to solve important problems such as measuring the brightness of galaxies beyond the Milky Way. This is of great significance for formulating future space flight plans.

Professor Stanyukovich said that when the second artificial satellite comes into contact with the lower atmosphere in the future, it may not be completely burned. Studying the remnants of the second satellite that fall on the Earth will be of great benefit to science, if this part can be found.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: Academician Barkin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences hosted a press conference on the afternoon of the 15th. Soviet scientists introduced the achievements and observations of the Soviet Union's launch of artificial satellites to 150 Soviet and foreign journalists.

Scientists pointed out that the Soviet Union has systematically developed rocket technology since 1949. This year, two artificial satellites were successfully launched, and a series of new artificial satellites are planned to be launched in the future. In the near future, the Soviet Union may reach the second cosmic velocity, that is, eleven kilometers and two hundred meters per second, so that the rocket can overcome the Earth's gravity and fly to the moon.

The famous Soviet scientist Pokrovsky said that the Soviet scientists' research plan on the animals in the second artificial satellite has been completed. The materials obtained are very valuable and are currently being carefully studied. The dog "Laika" not only survived in space for a few minutes but survived for several days. Now, it has died because the oxygen ran out. According to the original plan, it was not intended to be returned to Earth.

When answering a reporter's question about whether humans could fly to the universe soon, Pokrovsky said that the first priority is to ensure that humans can safely return to Earth, which must first be tested on animals.

Scientists also announced that observations of the first artificial satellite helped Soviet scientists more accurately calculate the orbit of the second satellite. At present, the Soviet Academy of Sciences receives many reports on satellite observations every day. Soviet scientists expressed their sincere gratitude to scientists from all countries who widely participated in the observation of artificial Earth satellites.

    苏联准备放出一系列卫星
    第二个卫星的动物研究已获丰富资料
    新华社16日讯  据塔斯社报道：莫斯科综合技术博物馆15日举行了关于第二个人造地球卫星的晚会。苏联科学家在会上讲了话。
    苏联科学院通讯院士金兹堡说：在最近几年内，地球这个古老的行星除了有月亮这个老卫星以外，将拥有一系列的卫星——试验室，这将成为人类将来飞向宇宙的中间站。今后科学家可以利用人造卫星来解决如测量银河系以外的星系的亮度之类重要的问题。这对于制订未来的宇宙飞行计划有重大意义。
    斯塔纽科维奇教授说，第二个人造卫星将来接触到大气低层的时候，可能不完全烧掉。研究落在地球上的第二个卫星的残余部分对于科学有很大好处，如果这部分能够找到的话。
    新华社莫斯科16日电  15日下午，苏联科学院院士巴尔金主持了一次记者招待会。由苏联科学家向一百五十名苏联和外国记者介绍苏联发射人造卫星的成就和观测情况。
    科学家们指出，苏联从1949年起，就有系统地发展火箭技术。今年成功发射了两个人造卫星，今后还准备发射一系列新的人造卫星。在最近期间苏联就可能达到第二宇宙速度，即每秒十一公里二百公尺，使火箭克服地心引力飞向月球。
    苏联著名科学家波克罗夫斯基说，苏联科学家对第二个人造卫星中的动物的研究计划已经完成。获得的材料非常宝贵。目前正在仔细研究中。小狗“莱伊卡”不仅在宇宙空际生存几分钟，而生存了几天。现在，它已经因为氧气用完而死去。按照原来的计划，就不准备让它回到地球上来的。
    波克罗夫斯基在回答记者提出的人是否能够很快就飞向宇宙的问题时说，首先要保证人能安全地回到地球上来，这必须先用动物来试验。
    科学家们还宣布对第一个人造卫星的观测帮助了苏联科学家更准确地计算第二个卫星的轨道。目前，苏联科学院每天都收到许多关于观察卫星情况的报告。苏联科学家们向各国广泛参加观察人造地球卫星的科学家表示热诚的谢意。
