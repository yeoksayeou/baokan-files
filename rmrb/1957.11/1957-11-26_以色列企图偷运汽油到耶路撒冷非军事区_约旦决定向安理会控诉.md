Xinhua News Agency, 25th dispatch from Amman: Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rifai said on the 24th that Jordan has instructed its representative to the United Nations to immediately file a complaint with the Security Council, accusing Israel of attempting to smuggle gasoline into the Jerusalem demilitarized zone and constructing fortifications there.

Rifai also accused the United Nations Acting Chief Observer, Liri (an American), of being "unjust and biased" in this and previous incidents. He said he had telegraphed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjold to request Liri's replacement.

Jordanian authorities had, on November 20, blocked an Israeli convoy from passing through the Mandelbaum Gate, controlled by Jordan, to Mount Scopus in the Jerusalem demilitarized zone. Jordanian authorities said the gasoline transported by the convoy was not needed by the Israeli police and maintenance personnel stationed in the demilitarized zone. Jordan accused Israel of attempting to bring gasoline into the demilitarized zone for military purposes.

After the 1949 Palestine War Armistice, Jerusalem was divided into Jordanian and Israeli sectors according to the armistice agreement between Jordan and Israel. Mount Scopus is surrounded by Jordanian-controlled territory. Mount Scopus is the location of Israeli demilitarized zone personnel, and for several years, Jordan has allowed Israeli convoys to pass through the Jordanian-controlled area to this location once every two weeks.

On November 21, Jordanian authorities also accused Israeli troops of firing at Arab positions from the ceasefire line and intruding into Jordanian territory to capture a Jordanian farmer. The Jordanian government telegraphed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjold that night to protest these incidents and issued an ultimatum to the UN Truce Supervision Organization in Jerusalem, demanding that Israel immediately release the captured Jordanian farmer.

Meanwhile, an Israeli military spokesman also accused armed Jordanians on the 24th of attempting to kidnap three Israeli workers in the Kfar Saba area that morning, saying that this was the third such action by the Jordanian side in twenty-four hours.

    以色列企图偷运汽油到耶路撒冷非军事区
    约旦决定向安理会控诉
    新华社25日讯　安曼消息：约旦副首相兼外交大臣里法伊24日说，约旦已经指示它驻联合国的代表立即向安全理事会提出控诉，控告以色列企图偷运汽油到耶路撒冷非军事区，并且在那里修建防御工事。
    里法伊还指责联合国代理首席观察员利里（美国人）在这次事件和以前几次事件上都是“不公正和偏袒一方”。他说，他已经打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德要求撤换利里。
    约旦当局曾经在11月20阻止一个以色列运输队通过约旦所控制的曼德鲍姆门去耶路撒冷非军事区内的斯科普斯山。约旦当局说，这个运输队输送的汽油是驻在非军事区内的以色列警察和保养人员所不需要的。约旦指责以色列企图把汽油运入非军事区用于军事目的。
    在1949年巴勒斯坦战争停战后，根据约旦和以色列的停战协定，耶路撒冷分为约旦区和以色列区。斯科普斯山处在约旦控制的地区包围之中。斯科普斯山是以色列非军事区人员的驻地，几年来，约旦一直允许以色列运输队每两周一次通过约旦控制区进入这个地方。
    11月21日，约旦当局还曾经指责以色列军队从停战线上向阿拉伯阵地开火，并且侵入约旦境内抓走了一个约旦农民。约旦政府曾经在当晚打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德对这些事件表示抗议，并且向在耶路撒冷的联合国停战委员会提出最后通牒，要求以色列立即释放被抓走的约旦农民。
    同时，以色列军方发言人在24日也指责武装的约旦人在当天上午试图在克法萨巴地区绑架三个以色列工人，并且说，这是约旦方面在二十四小时内第三次进行这样的行动。
