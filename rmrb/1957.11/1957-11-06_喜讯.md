    Good News
    Oh, white clouds over the thousand-mile plain, pigeons carried by the ten-thousand-mile wind, please send the golden rice ears from the banks of the Huai River to the magnificent Kremlin, and tell our most beloved people the good news of the harvest on both sides of the Huai River. Selfless assistance has taken root of happiness here, and the suffering Huai River has become a treasure bowl.

    喜讯
    严阵过千里平原上空的白云，你乘万里天风远飞的鸽群，请把淮河边金色的稻穗，送到壮丽的克里姆林，把淮河两岸丰收的喜讯，告诉我们最敬爱的人，无私的帮助在这里扎下幸福的根，苦难的淮河已经变成聚宝盆。
