Celebrating the Fortieth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution
    Resolutely Follow the Path of the October Revolution
    Lin Boqu
    The fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution is fast approaching. Now, not only the Soviet people, but also the people of China and the various fraternal socialist countries, as well as the working people of all other countries in the world, are celebrating this festival with joy and excitement. The celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution has become a powerful mass upsurge, and this celebration upsurge itself shows that the October Revolution is not only a great festival for the Soviet people, but also a great festival common to the working people of the world.
    The great October Socialist Revolution has extremely important international significance. November 7, 1917, was a new era in human history. Before the October Revolution, there had been many revolutions in human history, but the result was only the change of dynasties of the exploiting classes, while class exploitation and national oppression still existed, and the working people did not gain liberation. Only the Russian October Revolution of 1917 completely overthrew all the exploiting classes and established a government of the real working people. From then on, the rule of imperialism over the world was broken; from then on, the world was divided into two, and the red flag of proletarian revolutionary victory began to flutter over one-sixth of the earth's surface. However, the merits of the October Revolution are not limited to this. The October Revolution also inspired the proletariat and working people all over the world with its own example, armed the proletariat and working people all over the world with its own experience, and spread Marxism-Leninism to the world, thus illuminating the path to liberation for the proletariat and working people all over the world. Therefore, from the day of the October Revolution, the situation of the people's victory has been determined, and imperialism is already declining and approaching its doom.
    It has been exactly forty years since the October Revolution, and forty years is only a short period in social history. However, despite the shortness of time, and despite the many explorations and experiments and inevitable twists and turns in establishing a new social system that has never existed before, the socialist system has already demonstrated its incomparable superiority over the capitalist system. We know that the Soviet Union was also a poor and backward country at the beginning of its founding, and its foundation was not very rich. And in the past forty years, the imperialists have also forced the Soviet Union to carry out three years of civil war and more than four years of Patriotic War. However, neither economic difficulties nor cruel wars could crush the world's first socialist country. On the contrary, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have built their motherland into the world's first-class power at a speed that capitalism cannot imagine. The total output of Soviet industry has reached thirty-three times that before the October Revolution; in the world's industrial production, the proportion of Soviet industrial output has increased from 2% to 3% in 1917 to about 20% now. Soviet agriculture is also the most mechanized large-scale agriculture in the world. The 20th Congress of the CPSU has put forward an inspiring task for the Soviet people, to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in the shortest period in history. As for the development of science and culture, the Soviet Union has surpassed all capitalist countries. Now, the Soviet Union trains nearly three times as many senior engineering and technical personnel every year as the United States. The Soviet Union has recently built the first nuclear power plant, manufactured the first batch of jet airliners, manufactured the first batch of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and launched the first artificial satellite. Obviously, Soviet science has taken the lead in the world, and it is also sufficient to explain the superiority of the socialist system.
    In the period after the October Revolution, for a considerable period of time, the Soviet Union was fighting alone to build socialism. But now, the situation is completely different. In Europe, there are Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia; in Asia, there are our country, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Mongolia, all of which have embarked on the path of the October Revolution. Relying on the superiority of the socialist system, these countries have achieved great achievements in economic construction and cultural construction, the face of the country is changing rapidly, and people's lives have been greatly improved on the basis of production development. Socialism has formed a system on a global scale, their territory accounts for about 26% of the world's total, their population accounts for about 35% of the world's total, and their industrial output accounts for about one-third of the world's total. Socialist countries are connected in territory and support each other, forming an unbreakable socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Moreover, we also see that the colonial system, which is the lifeline of imperialism, is disintegrating. Before World War II, the population of colonies and dependencies was about 1.5 billion, and now 1.2 billion have freed themselves from the shackles of colonialism and embarked on the road of independent development. The proletarian revolutionary movement in the capitalist world is also developing vigorously.
    Therefore, we can say with full confidence that the forty years of history since the October Revolution have irrefutably proved the strong vitality of the socialist system, and socialism will surely win in the competition with capitalism.
    In celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the glorious task of our Chinese people is to unswervingly follow the path of the October Revolution. Our people have gone through a long and arduous revolutionary struggle, but only after the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to China did the revolutionary situation change, and ultimately achieve today's victory and achievements. This year, in our country, the bourgeois rightists took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to launch a rampant attack. They clamored to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, oppose democratic centralism, abandon socialist transformation and socialist construction, and oppose leaning to one side in foreign policy. All of this, in a word, is to make the Chinese people leave the path of the October Revolution. The conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists has been shamefully bankrupt under the condemnation of the people of the whole country. However, we should see that in the transition period before the complete establishment of socialism, this struggle between taking the socialist road or taking the capitalist road will never stop or disappear. We should be vigilant, defend socialism at all times, and smash the enemy's attacks.
    We must also redouble our efforts to build our country. In the past eight years, thanks to the united efforts of the people of the whole country and the generous assistance of the Soviet Union, our country's socialist construction has made great achievements, and the first five-year plan is about to be overfulfilled. However, because our country's foundation is too weak, it will take a long-term and unremitting effort to build our country into a prosperous and strong country. We must adhere to the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, learn from the Soviet people's spirit of hard work and dedication to the interests of national construction, and learn from the Soviet people's spirit of indomitable struggle and overcoming all difficulties. We must also continue to adhere to the experience of Soviet construction and closely integrate it with the actual situation in our country to promote the socialist construction of our country.
    We must also unswervingly strengthen the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Strengthen the international unity of the proletariat. This unity is not only a guarantee for the victory of our national construction, but also a guarantee for the prosperity and development of the socialist camp and the maintenance of world peace. Now, the balance of power between socialism and capitalism in the world has undergone a fundamental change in favor of socialism. Naturally, the imperialists do not like this, and they are even more frantically carrying out conspiracies and sabotage against socialist countries and adhering to their bankrupt "policy of strength" and actively preparing for war. Recently, US imperialism is instigating Turkey to launch an armed attack on Syria, a peace-loving nation and independent country in the Middle East, creating an extremely tense situation in the Middle East. But people can see that because the Syrian people are determined to defend their national independence, because of the unity of the Arab nation, and more because of the strong support of the Soviet Union and socialist countries, and because of the support of peace-loving people all over the world, Syria will surely defeat the conspiracy of imperialism.
    In order to strengthen international unity, our people must resolutely oppose and eliminate bourgeois nationalism. Nationalism has progressive significance in some eras and in some countries today, but it has only a reactionary side in socialist China. In today's situation in our country, bourgeois nationalism is essentially a manifestation of bourgeois selfishness, demanding that the interests of one's own nation be placed above the overall international interests of the proletariat and working people of all countries, and the result is to damage internationalist unity, thereby also damaging the fundamental interests of our people.
    In celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we feel incomparably excited. The wheel of history is constantly moving forward, and there is no force in the world that can stop us from holding high the banner of socialism and moving towards victory along the path of the October Revolution.
    Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism!

    庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年
    坚定不移地走十月革命的道路
    林伯渠
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的节日快要到来了。现在，不但是苏联人民，而且我们中国人民和各个兄弟的社会主义国家的人民以及世界上其他所有国家的劳动人民，都在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝这个节日。庆祝十月革命四十周年，已经成为一种强有力的群众性的热潮，这种庆祝热潮的本身也就说明十月革命这个节日，不仅是苏联人民的伟大节日，而且是全世界劳动人民共同的伟大节日。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命具有极其重大的国际意义。1917年的11月7日是人类历史的新纪元。在十月革命以前，人类历史上也发生过许多次的革命，但是其结果只是剥削阶级的改朝换代，而阶级剥削和民族压迫依然存在，劳动人民并没有获得解放。只有1917年的俄国十月革命，才彻底地推翻了一切剥削阶级，建立了真正的劳动人民的政权。从此以后，帝国主义对世界的统治，被打开了缺口；从此以后，世界被分裂为二，在地球的六分之一的面积上，开始飘扬起无产阶级革命胜利的红旗。然而，十月革命的功劳还不仅限于此，十月革命还以自己的榜样，鼓舞了全世界的无产阶级和劳动人民，以自己的经验，武装了全世界的无产阶级和劳动人民，把马克思列宁主义传播到全世界，因而照亮了全世界无产阶级和劳动人民解放的道路。因此，从十月革命的一天起，人民胜利的局面，已经确定，帝国主义已经是日薄西山，日益临近自己的末日了。
    十月革命到今天整整四十年，而四十年在社会历史上，只是一个不长的时期。但是，尽管时间是这样的短，尽管建立一个前所未有的新的社会制度，要经过许多的探索与试验和不可避免的曲折，社会主义制度却已经显示了它对于资本主义制度的无可比拟的优越性。我们知道，苏联建国之初也是贫穷和落后的国家，底子不很丰富。而在四十年中，帝国主义者还迫使苏联进行了三年的国内战争和四年多的卫国战争。但是，无论是经济困难，无论是残酷的战争，都不能摧折这世界上第一个社会主义国家。相反地，苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，却以资本主义无法想像的速度把自己的祖国建成为世界上第一等的强国。苏联工业的总产量已经达到十月革命前的三十三倍；在全世界工业生产中，苏联工业产量的比重已由1917年的2％到3％增加到现在的20％左右。苏联的农业亦是世界上机械化程度最高的大规模的农业。苏共第二十次代表大会更向苏联人民提出鼓舞人心的任务，要在历史上最短的时期内在按人口计算的产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。至于在科学文化的发展方面，苏联更是赶过了一切资本主义国家。现在，苏联每年培养出来的高级工程技术人员将近美国的三倍。苏联近来建立了第一个原子能发电站，制成了第一批喷气式客机，制成了第一批洲际弹道火箭，发射了第一个人造卫星。很明显的：苏联的科学已在世界上领先了，也足以说明社会主义制度的优越性。
    在十月革命以后，有相当长的时期苏联是孤军奋斗地建设着社会主义。但是现在，情况已经完全不同了。在欧洲有阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫，在亚洲有我国、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古，都走上了十月革命的道路。依靠着社会主义制度的优越性，这些国家在经济建设和文化建设方面无不获得巨大的成就，国家的面貌在迅速改变，人民生活在生产发展的基础上得到很大的改善。社会主义在世界范围内已经形成了一个体系，它们的领土约占全世界的26％，人口约占全世界的35％，工业产量约占全世界的三分之一。社会主义国家在领土上连成一片，互相支援，形成了以苏联为首的牢不可破的社会主义阵营。
    而且，我们还看到，作为帝国主义生命线的殖民体系正在瓦解。在第二次世界大战以前，殖民地和附属国的人口有十五亿左右，现在已有十二亿摆脱了殖民主义的枷锁，走上独立发展的道路。资本主义世界的无产阶级的革命运动也在蓬勃地发展。
    因此，我们可以满怀信心地说，十月革命以来四十年的历史已经确定不移地证明了社会主义制度的强大的生命力，社会主义在和资本主义的竞赛中必将获得胜利。
    在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十年的时候，我们中国人民的光荣任务就是要坚定不移地走十月革命的道路。我国人民经过长期的艰苦的革命斗争，但是唯有在十月革命把马克思列宁主义传到中国之后，革命的局面方才改观，而最终取得今天的胜利与成就。今年，在我国国内，资产阶级右派利用共产党整风的机会发动猖狂的进攻，他们叫嚣着要推翻共产党的领导，推翻无产阶级专政，反对民主集中制，放弃社会主义改造和社会主义建设，反对在对外政策上一边倒。所有这些，一句话，就是要中国人民离开十月革命的道路。资产阶级右派的阴谋在全国人民声讨之下已经遭到可耻的破产。但是，我们应当看到，在完全建成社会主义以前的过渡时期中，这种走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的斗争，决不会停止和消灭。我们应当提高警惕，随时捍卫社会主义，粉碎敌人的进攻。
    我们还要加倍努力地建设我们的国家。在过去八年中，由于全国人民团结一致的努力，并有苏联的慷慨援助，我们国家的社会主义建设已经取得重大成就，第一个五年计划将要超额完成。但是，由于我们国家底子太弱，要把我国建成一个富强的国家，还须要长期的坚持不懈的努力。我们必须坚持勤俭建国的方针，要学习苏联人民那种艰苦奋斗、服从国家建设利益的精神，学习苏联人民那种不屈不挠、战胜一切困难的精神。我们还要继续坚持学习苏联建设的经验和我国实际情况密切地结合起来，来促进我们国家的社会主义建设。
    我们还要坚定不移地加强中苏两国的友好团结，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。加强无产阶级的国际团结。这种团结不仅是我们国家建设胜利的保障，而且是社会主义阵营繁荣发展、世界和平得以维持的保障。现在，世界上社会主义和资本主义力量的对比，已经发生了有利于社会主义的根本变化。自然，帝国主义者对这一点是并不喜欢的，他们更加疯狂地对社会主义国家进行阴谋破坏，并且坚持其已破产的“实力政策”积极地准备战争。最近美帝国主义正唆使土耳其向中东的爱好和平的民族独立国家叙利亚进行武装进攻，而造成了中东的极其紧张的局势。但是人们可以看得到，由于叙利亚人民坚决保卫自己的民族独立，由于阿拉伯民族的团结，同时更由于强大的苏联和各社会主义国家的声援，由于全世界爱好和平的人民的支持，叙利亚必定会战胜帝国主义的阴谋的。
    为了加强国际的团结，我国人民必须要坚决反对和清除资产阶级民族主义。民族主义在某些时代以及现在某些国家有着进步意义，但是它在社会主义的中国却只有反动的一面。在今天我国情况下，资产阶级民族主义实质上是资产阶级自私自利的表现，要求把本民族的利益置于各国无产阶级和劳动人民的国际总利益之上，其结果是损害了国际主义的团结，从而也损害了我国人民的根本利益。
    在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，我们感到无比的兴奋。历史的车轮在不断前进，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡我们高举着社会主义的大旗，沿着十月革命的道路走向胜利。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义万岁！
