Wife Reads a Big-Character Poster

This story takes place in the forging workshop of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory.

Forging the "spring curved end pad," a part for the construction-type locomotive, was a headache for Wang Zhenyu's forging team due to the lack of proper tool molds. To forge the "spring end pad" into a curved shape, they had to hit it repeatedly, twenty-some times. If they didn't hit it just right, the arm holding the tongs would be painfully jolted.

The first batch of tasks was completed with great difficulty, and the second batch of tasks came down. When Wang Zhenyu accepted the task, he frowned for a long time without saying a word. Apprentice Xiao Zhang came over and whispered a few words in Wang Zhenyu's ear. Wang Zhenyu said, "Right! Let's put up a big-character poster too."

As luck would have it, shortly after Wang Zhenyu's team put up their big-character poster, the factory began organizing visits for the families of the workers. Wang Zhenyu's wife, Chen Zhijie, came to the factory with the group. When she walked past the entrance of the forging workshop, she saw a big-character poster written by Wang Zhenyu in the "Letting off Steam" corner: "...Leading comrades, our team's old molds have been unusable for many years. We hope you can find a way to help solve this problem..." After reading it, she didn't quite agree with it.

After dinner, Wang Zhenyu heard that his wife had visited the factory and seen the big-character poster, so he talked to her about it. Chen Zhijie said: "Your opinion is right, but it lacks a sense of ownership." Wang Zhenyu was very unhappy when he heard this and retorted, "What part of my big-character poster lacks a sense of ownership?" Chen Zhijie said: "Although I don't understand the technology in your workshop, I think you also have a responsibility to help the leaders solve the problem you raised." Wang Zhenyu pondered his wife's words repeatedly and felt that they made a lot of sense.

From the next day onwards, Wang Zhenyu looked for scrap materials and drew sketches during every break. After a few days, he finally made a rough model of the "spring curved end pad." Later, the leadership found a machining workshop to help him process it, and finally, the mold was successfully made. Using the mold increased production efficiency by more than four times. Now the forging team has proactively requested a reduction in the man-hour quota for this forging.

    爱人看了大字报
    这个故事发生在大连机车车辆厂锻冶车间。
    在没有规矩的工具胎型的条件下，锻造建设型机车零件——“弹簧曲型端垫”，很使王珍瑜锻造小组伤脑筋。为了要把“弹簧端垫”锻成曲型，他们要反复打二十几锤。凑巧哪一下锻不正当，就会把把钳的手臂震得生痛。
    第一批任务好容易完成了，第二批任务又下来了。王珍瑜接受这任务时，皱着个眉头老半天没说话。徒工小张过来，贴在王珍瑜的耳朵上说了几句话，王珍瑜说：“对！咱们也来个大字报。”
    事情也真凑巧，王珍瑜小组的大字报贴出不久，工厂就开始组织职工家属来工厂参观。王珍瑜的爱人陈志杰也和大伙一块来到了工厂。她走过锻冶车间门前时，看见鸣放园地贴了一张王珍瑜写的大字报：“……领导同志，我们小组多年来的旧胎具已经不能用了，希望你们想办法帮助解决……”。她看了一遍，心里有些不以为然。
    吃过晚饭，王珍瑜听说爱人参观了工厂的大字报，便和她谈起来。陈志杰说：你的意见提的倒很对，就是还缺少点主人翁思想。王珍瑜一听很不痛快，反问道：“你说，我那张大字报哪点缺少主人翁思想？”陈志杰说：我虽然不懂你们车间的技术，可是我觉得你提的那个问题，你自己也是有责任帮助领导来解决的。王珍瑜把爱人的这几句话反复地寻思了几遍，觉得很有道理。
    从第二天起，王珍瑜每到休息时间就到处去找废材料，画草图。几天以后，他终于把“弹簧曲型端垫”的荒型做出来了。以后领导上又找加工车间帮助他加工，终于把胎型做成功了。使用胎型，生产效率提高四倍多。现在锻造小组已主动要求降低了这一锻件的工时定额。
