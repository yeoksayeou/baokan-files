    Prosperous Middle Peasants and Socialism
    -- An Investigation Conducted in the Agricultural Cooperative Where Liu Jiemei is Located in Huanggang County, Hubei
    By our reporter Jiang Xia, Lin Xi
    Which road should prosperous middle peasants take? The road of capitalism and individual wealth, or the road of socialism and common prosperity? Answering this question is of great significance, because the number of people in the prosperous middle peasant class accounts for 20% to 30% of the rural population nationwide. Their trends often suffice to influence the entire rural socialist transformation cause.
    Recently, we conducted some investigations on the economic changes of 79 prosperous middle peasant households in the Qunli Third Agricultural Cooperative in Huanggang County, Hubei Province, over the past few years. Like other regions across the country, a considerable number of prosperous middle peasants in this cooperative harbor resentment towards the country's policy of unified purchase and sale and the cooperative movement. The fundamental reason is that the socialist revolution in the countryside restricts and blocks their path to individual capitalist wealth. Liu Jiemei, a prosperous middle peasant in this cooperative who exposed and criticized his own forgetful thoughts and desire to take the road of capitalist exploitation in this great debate between the two roads, is a typical representative of this cooperative.
    The prosperous middle peasant class, due to its relatively superior economic conditions and historical exploitation to varying degrees, has a desire to take the road of capitalist individual wealth, especially given the low level of production and living in China's rural areas today. According to a 1952 survey, in just one year after the land reform, within the scope of the current Qunli Third Cooperative, as many as nineteen prosperous middle peasant households and one rich peasant household had risen by relying on exploitation (hiring labor, lending at high interest rates, collecting tenant rent, lending grain for interest, etc.). Although land reform improved the lives of most peasants, some peasants, especially poor peasants, still frequently encountered difficulties in production and life due to their large families and meager resources. As a result, some people sold their land and houses or worked as hired laborers for others. Among the 229 peasant households within the scope of this cooperative, 58 suffered exploitation, of which 22 poor peasant households were approaching the brink of bankruptcy.

      The Path to Individual Wealth for Prosperous Middle Peasants is Restricted
    In 1953, the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, and at the end of 1955, agricultural cooperativization was realized. This effectively cracked down on and restricted the exploitation of poor peasants and commercial speculation by rich peasants and prosperous middle peasants, promoted the development of production, and curbed class differentiation. Tao Renqing, a poor peasant who had borrowed money from Liu Jiemei, had a total agricultural income of 145 yuan for the entire year of 1952. After deducting 50 yuan for repaying cloth debts, grain interest, and high interest rates, the actual income of his family of five for the year was only 95 yuan. In 1956, the first year after cooperativization, Tao Renqing's actual income for the year reached 294 yuan, more than double that of 1952. The result of the state's implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain was that the majority of peasants had a guarantee of rations, and they no longer needed to borrow grain and money from prosperous middle peasants. In 1952 alone, the nineteen prosperous middle peasant households and one rich peasant household mentioned above that rose through exploitation lent out 175 dan of grain for interest and 1,215 yuan at high interest rates (the annual interest rate for lending grain and money in this area was 100% or higher). Five households bought 18 mu of land, three households bought six rooms of houses, and seven households collected 41 dan of tenant rent. The exploitative income of prosperous middle peasants hiring labor is not included in the calculations.
  Is Socialism Beneficial to Prosperous Middle Peasants?
    The road to capitalism for prosperous middle peasants was blocked. Under the circumstances of the high tide of cooperativization, they turned to socialism -- participating in cooperatives. Let us look at it economically: are the unified purchase and sale and cooperativization beneficial to them?
    Here are a few typical investigations.
    Ding Shaosong, an old prosperous middle peasant. Before cooperativization, he had 10.13 mu of land. In 1953, his family's total agricultural income was 345 yuan and 75 fen; sideline income was 150 yuan; exploitation income (lending grain and money) totaled 344 yuan; and commercial income (trading cattle) was 55 yuan. The total of the above was 894 yuan and 75 fen. After deducting 106 yuan for public grain and production investment, the net income was 788 yuan and 75 fen. The family of nine had an average annual income of 87 yuan and 64 fen per person.
    What was the income situation of his family in the first year after cooperativization (i.e., 1956)? Ding Shaosong and his second younger brother earned 5,912 work points throughout the year (each point worth 6 fen and 6 li), with an income of 390 yuan and 02 jiao, plus 100 yuan from his third younger brother working outside, after deducting his own expenses, totaling 490 yuan and 02 jiao; sideline income was 150 yuan. The total income for the year was 640 yuan and 02 jiao. The family of eleven had an average income of 58 yuan and 2 jiao per person.
    It is clear that after joining the advanced cooperative, his family's total income decreased by 148 yuan and 55 fen compared to 1953. However, if we exclude his family's exploitation and commercial income in 1953, then the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations in 1956 not only did not decrease but increased by 144 yuan and 45 fen compared to 1953. That is to say, the superiority of agricultural production had already been demonstrated in the first year of cooperativization. According to a survey of the entire cooperative, the income from agriculture and sideline occupations in 1956 increased by 34.8% compared to the initial cooperative period in 1955. Among the 229 households in the entire cooperative, 193 households increased their income. Among them, there were 51 prosperous middle peasant households whose income from agriculture and sideline occupations increased by 41.7% compared to when they worked individually in 1952. The remaining 28 prosperous middle peasant households did not increase their income, or their income decreased somewhat.
    The unified purchase and sale and cooperativization have increased the income from agriculture and sideline occupations for the vast majority of peasants (including most of the prosperous middle peasants). Only the exploitative behaviors of some prosperous middle peasants have been restricted, and their total income has therefore decreased somewhat. Isn't this a perfectly normal and reasonable phenomenon?
    Although the prosperous middle peasants have a stronger economic foundation than the average peasants, they are still small-scale farmers after all. Once they encounter natural disasters or man-made misfortunes, they are difficult to resist. Xiao Guodong, an old upper-middle peasant, had 22 mu of land before liberation and harvested 99 dan of rice every year. He hired long-term and temporary workers and lived a relatively prosperous life. Soon after, his wife died, and the following year he remarried, and then his father also died one after another. In this series of weddings and funerals, this fairly wealthy family had to shoulder debts of thousands of yuan. In 1947, the three brothers divided the family property, and Xiao Guodong had relatively less land because he had more family members (six). In order to repay his debts, he had to sell more than three mu of land. From then on, he had to rely on borrowing to make a living. From 1953, this area suffered from three years of flooding, and Xiao Guodong's land was also flooded, with rice production reduced by half each year. This prosperous middle peasant household was on the verge of bankruptcy. Just then, the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain. From 1953, the state supplied his family with 720 jin of rice at a price of 7 fen and 4 li per jin every year for three years. He calculated the accounts himself: if he had bought rice on the black market before the unified purchase and sale, it would have cost 1 jiao and 1 fen and 6 li per jin. The 2,160 jin of rice supplied by the state in three years saved him a total of 90 yuan and 7 jiao. In addition, the state reduced or exempted a total of 1,800 jin of public grain from him in three years, which also amounted to 90 yuan.
    In the autumn of 1955, after the entire township transitioned to advanced cooperatives, the land was used uniformly, and he no longer had to worry about his land being flooded. In 1956, because the labor force (a total of two people) could be fully utilized, his family earned more than 4,200 work points, equivalent to more than 270 yuan, which was more than 80 yuan more than the average total income of agriculture and sideline occupations of 190 yuan and 03 jiao and 7 fen during the three years after the land reform and before the cooperativization, with a growth rate of 43%. This year, the cooperative sent him to work at the livestock exchange, and with the labor of his son, the expected income will be higher than last year.
    Another new prosperous middle peasant, Liu Runsheng, had worked as a long-term laborer for a landlord for ten years before the land reform. After the land reform, his life continued to improve, so he began to trade fish fry, cattle, and timber. However, engaging in commercial speculation sometimes did not increase his income, and he even lost capital several times in the past two years. After persuasion and education by the cadres, he cleared his mind and expressed his determination to cut off his capitalist tail.
    The situations of Xiao Guodong and Liu Runsheng vividly illustrate that only by abandoning exploitation, abandoning commercial speculation, actively participating in cooperative labor, and resolutely taking the road of common prosperity can prosperous middle peasants truly become prosperous. Otherwise, in the capitalist ocean, they will be eaten up like "big fish eat small fish."
        The Truth About Grain Shortages
    We stayed in the home of poor peasant Lu Xianwang for eight days and ate with them. His family has three meals a day. Except for porridge for breakfast, the other two meals are rice, and everyone eats their fill. However, some prosperous middle peasants complain that they do not have enough grain to eat. What is the truth? The average grain ration per person in this cooperative is: 450 jin in 1952; 470 jin in 1953; 485 jin in 1954; 524 jin in 1955; and 572 jin in 1956. The grain ration has been increasing year by year, but they still "do not have enough to eat." Where is the truth? The prosperous middle peasant Ding Shaosong used to exploit poor peasants by lending grain at high interest rates, but when the unified purchase and sale began, he insisted that he was short of grain, and as a result, more than 18 dan of surplus grain were found. Two other prosperous middle peasants, Zhu Dating and Cao Qizhai, hid their surplus grain in the coffin; one claimed that his family only had two and a half sheng of rice left, but his family relied on this "two and a half sheng" of rice from November last year until the wheat harvest this year without finishing it!
      The Performance of Prosperous Middle Peasants in the Cooperative
    There are also some differences in economic status among the prosperous middle peasants, which determines that their attitudes towards the cooperative are different. Prosperous middle peasants He Qiliang and Liu Runsheng, because their degree of exploitation of poor peasants was minor, and the unified purchase and sale and cooperativization did not conflict with their long-term and immediate economic interests, behaved more positively in the cooperative. He Qiliang is very old, but he goes to work almost every day of the year. This year, he also voluntarily oversubscribed for public bonds. Liu Runsheng is also very responsible for the production of the cooperative. Last year, he increased the income of the cooperative by 400 yuan, and this year, he expects to have more income. Currently, there are not many prosperous middle peasants like He Qiliang and Liu Runsheng who voluntarily take the socialist road.
    Prosperous middle peasants who had a heavier degree of exploitation of peasants in the past and whose income has decreased significantly after cooperativization have a bad attitude towards the cooperative, and some even have a very bad attitude. The old prosperous middle peasant Cao Qizhai used to lend a large amount of grain and money at high interest rates. The unified purchase and sale and cooperativization "encroached" on his capitalist economic interests, and he has been dissatisfied with the cooperative ever since. He refused to pay his cooperative shares and some of the production materials needed by the cooperative. Last year, he also repeatedly stole grain, firewood, and timber from the cooperative. He also spread rumors in an attempt to undermine production. Due to his hatred of the cooperative, he was not very active in labor. His family's three main laborers only earned more than 4,000 work points last year. Prosperous middle peasants like Cao Qizhai, who have serious capitalist ideas, only account for a minority in their class.
    Other prosperous middle peasants whose income has not increased or decreased, or has decreased but not by much, compared to before joining the advanced cooperative, and who had a good impression of the initial cooperative in the past, have an attitude of "following the crowd" towards the cooperative, but are easily influenced by capitalism. They also have some opinions about the cooperative. For example, they feel that production is too tight; the cooperative does not treat all members equally (referring to mobilizing them to invest in production and purchase public bonds more than poor and lower-middle peasants, while they are not eligible for loans and solutions to life difficulties); they demand that cooperative cadres participate in production; and they demand that they be allowed to engage in more individual sideline production, etc. This type of household accounts for a larger proportion of prosperous middle peasants.

    The above survey materials illustrate that the Party Central Committee's decision to launch a great debate on the two roads in the countryside is very timely and necessary. Through the debate on major issues of right and wrong about socialism, the goal of uniting and transforming prosperous middle peasants can be achieved.
    The opinions of prosperous middle peasants about the cooperative have their incorrect side. Their incorrect opinions should be criticized and explained. However, their opinions also have a correct part, such as making useful suggestions on production and suggesting reducing the number of full-time cadres. The organization of the cooperative should study and adopt these good opinions.

    富裕中农和社会主义
    ——在湖北黄冈县刘介梅所在农业社所作的调查	本报记者　江夏　林晰
    富裕中农走哪条路？走资本主义个人发财的道路，还是走社会主义共同富裕的道路？回答这个问题具有重要的意义，因为富裕中农这个阶层的人数，占全国农村人口的20％至30％。他们的动向，往往足以影响整个农村的社会主义改造事业。
    最近，我们在湖北省黄冈县群力第三农业社，对七十九户富裕中农几年来经济变化情况作了若干调查。和全国其他地区一样，这个社为数不少的富裕中农，对国家的统购统销政策和合作化事业抱有抵触情绪，根本原因在于农村的社会主义革命限制和堵死了他们走资本主义个人发财的道路。在这次两条道路的大辩论中，暴露和批判了自己有忘本思想、想走资本主义剥削道路的富裕中农刘介梅，就是这个社的典型代表。
    富裕中农这个阶层，由于在经济上有着比较优越的条件，在历史上有着程度不同的剥削行为，因此，在今天中国农村生产、生活水平都还很低的情况下，他们具有走向资本主义个人发财道路的欲望。据1952年的调查，土地改革后仅仅一年的时间里，在目前群力三社所包括的范围内，依靠剥削（雇工、放高利贷、收典谷、放生谷等）上升的就有十九户富裕中农和一户富农。土地改革虽然使大多数农民的生活有了改善，但也有部分农民，特别是贫农，由于家大口阔底子薄，他们在生产和生活上还是经常发生困难，部分人因此出卖了自己的田地房屋，或给别人当雇工。在这个社范围内的二百二十九户农民中，有五十八户遭受剥削，其中二十二户贫农接近了破产的边缘。
      限制了富裕中农个人发财
    1953年国家实行了粮食统购统销，1955年底又实现了农业合作化。这样，有力地打击和限制了富农和富裕中农对贫农的剥削和商业投机活动，促进了生产的发展，制止了阶级分化。曾经向刘介梅借过债的贫农陶仁清，1952年全年农业总收入为一百四十五元，除去还布债、生谷和高利贷等五十元外，全家五口人一年实际收入只有九十五元。1956年，合作化后的第一年，陶仁清全年实际收入达到二百九十四元，比1952年增加了两倍多。国家实行粮食统购统销的结果，使得大多数农民的口粮有了保证，他们可以不必再向富裕中农借粮借债了。而前面所述靠剥削上升的十九户富裕中农和一户富农，仅在1952年就放出生谷一百七十五石，高利贷一千二百十五元（这一带放谷、放钱的年利为100％或更高），有五户买田十八亩，三户买房屋六间，七户收典谷四十一石，至于富裕中农雇工的剥削收入，还未计算在内。
  社会主义对富裕中农是否有利
    富裕中农走向资本主义的道路被堵死了，在合作化高潮的形势下，他们转向了社会主义——参加合作社。让我们从经济上来看，统购统销和合作化对他们是不是有利。
    下面是几户典型调查。
    丁少松，老富裕中农。合作化前有田十点一三亩，1953年他家的农业总收入为三百四十五元七角五分；副业收入一百五十元；剥削收入（放粮放债）共计三百四十四元；商业收入（贩牛）五十五元。以上合计为八百九十四元七角五分。除去缴公粮和生产投资一百零六元，纯收入为七百八十八元七角五分。全家九口人，每人平均年收入八十七元六角四分。
    合作化后第一年（即1956年），他家的收入情况如何？丁少松和他二弟全年做五千九百十二个工分（分值六分六厘），收入三百九十元零二角，加上他三弟在外做工除掉自己花费以外的收入一百元，合计四百九十元零二角；副业收入一百五十元。全年共收入为六百四十元零二角，全家十一口人，平均每人收入为五十八元二角。
    很明显，参加高级社以后，他家的总收入比1953年减少了一百四十八元五角五分。但是如果除去他家1953年剥削和商业收入部分来看，那末，1956年的农副业总收入比起1953年不但没有减少，反而增加了一百四十四元四角五分。就是说，合作化第一年，在农业生产上已经显示了它的优越性。根据全社调查，1956年农副业收入比1955年初级社时期增加了34．8％。在全社二百二十九户当中，有一百九十三户增加了收入。其中有富裕中农五十一户，比1952年单干时的农副业收入增加了41．7％。其余二十八户富裕中农没有增加收入，或者有所减少。
    统购统销和合作化使广大农民（包括大部分的富裕中农）增加了农副业收入，只是一些富裕中农的剥削行为受到了限制，他们的总收入因而有所减少，这难道不是十分正常、十分合理的现象吗？
    富裕中农的家底虽然比一般农民雄厚一些，但毕竟还是小农经济，一旦遇到天灾人祸，他们也是难以抗拒的。老上中农肖国栋在解放前有田二十二亩，每年收稻谷九十九石，家里雇有长工和临时工，生活相当富裕。不久他老婆死去，第二年他又娶亲，接着父亲也相继死去。在这一连串的婚丧情况下，这个相当富裕的家庭就不得不背上上千元的债务。1947年弟兄三人分家，肖国栋因为家口多（六口），土地相对减少。为了还债，不得不卖掉三亩多田。从此，他就不得不经常靠借贷生活。从1953年开始，这一带闹了三年水灾，肖国栋的土地也被淹，稻谷每年减产一半。这户富裕中农眼看就要破产了。正在这时，国家实行了粮食统购统销，从1953年起，三年中国家每年以七分四厘一斤的价格供应了他家大米七百二十斤。他自己算了个账：如果在统购统销以前的黑市去买米，每斤需要一角一分六厘，国家三年中供应的大米二千一百六十斤，一共使他少支出九十元七角多。这还不算，国家在三年中一共减免他应交公粮一千八百斤，也合九十元。
    1955年秋，全乡转入高级社以后，土地统一使用，他不再发愁田地被淹了；1956年由于劳动力（共两个）能够充分发挥，他家共做了四千二百多个工分，合二百七十多元，比土改后合作化前的三年中，每年的农副业平均总收入一百九十元零三角七分增加了八十多元，增长率为43％。今年，社里派他到耕畜交易所工作，加上他儿子的劳动，预计收入比去年还有增加。
    另一户新富裕中农刘润生，土改前给地主当过十年长工，土改后生活不断上升，于是开始贩鱼秧、贩牛、贩木材。但是，搞商业投机有时并不能使他增加收入，两年来他甚至还蚀过几次本钱。经过干部的说服教育，他的思想搞通了，表示决心割断自己的资本主义尾巴。
    肖国栋和刘润生的情况，生动地说明了富裕中农只有抛弃剥削，抛弃商业投机，积极参加社内劳动，坚决走共同富裕的道路，才可能真正的富裕起来。不这样，在资本主义的海洋里，他们就会像“大鱼吃小鱼”那样被吃掉。
        缺　粮　的　真　相
    我们在贫农吕先望家里住了八天，和他们一起吃饭。他家一日三餐，除早餐吃粥外，其余两餐都是大米干饭，大家都吃得饱。但是有些富裕中农却叫嚷粮食不够吃。事实究竟怎样呢？这个社每人平均留粮是：1952年四百五十斤；1953年四百七十斤；1954年四百八十五斤；1955年五百二十四斤；1956年五百七十二斤。留粮逐年增长，反而“不够吃”，真相在哪里？富裕中农丁少松过去经常放谷剥削贫农，但在统购统销开始时，他硬说缺口粮，结果被查出十八石余粮。另两户富裕中农朱大庭和曹其斋，一户把余粮藏在棺材里；一户叫嚷家里只剩两升半米，但是他全家靠着这“两升半”米从去年11月起，一直吃到今年接麦还没有吃完哩！
      富裕中农在社内的表现
    富裕中农彼此之间，在经济上也存在着一些差别，这就决定他们对合作社的态度有所不同。富裕中农何启亮和刘润生，由于对贫农的剥削程度轻微，统购统销和合作化又和他们长远的和眼前的经济利益没有矛盾，因而在社内表现就比较积极。何启亮年纪很大，但是一年到头几乎天天出工，今年还主动超额购买了公债。刘润生对社里的生产也很负责，他去年为社增加了四百元的收入，今年预计有更多的收入。像何启亮，刘润生这样自愿走社会主义道路的富裕中农，目前为数还不很多。
    过去对农民剥削程度较重，合作化以后收入有显著减少的富裕中农，他们对社的态度就不好，个别的甚至很坏。老富裕中农曹其斋过去大量放谷和放高利贷，统购统销和合作化“侵犯”了他的资本主义经济利益，一直对社不满。他拒交入社股金和社里所需用的一些生产资料；去年又多次偷盗社里的粮食、柴草、木材等物，他还散布谣言，妄图破坏生产。由于他对合作社的仇视，劳动很不积极，他家三个主要劳动力去年只做了四千多个工分。像曹其斋这样具有严重资本主义思想的富裕中农，在其本阶层中只占少数。
    另一些富裕中农，他们在经济上比入高级社前不增不减，或有减少但不多，过去初级社对他们留有较好的印象，因而他们对待社的态度是“随大流”，但是很容易受资本主义的影响。他们对社也有一些意见。例如感到生产过于紧张；社对社员没有一视同仁（指动员他们的生产投资和购买公债要比贫农和下中农多一些，而贷款、解决生活困难轮不到他们）；要求社干部参加生产；要求允许多搞个人的副业生产等。这类户在富裕中农中占着较大的比例。
                  ×　×　×
    前面的调查材料说明了党中央决定在农村中开展两条道路的大辩论，是十分及时和必需的。通过对社会主义大是大非的争论，就可以达到团结和改造富裕中农的目的。
    富裕中农对合作社的意见，有其不正确的一面。对他们不正确的意见应该加以批判和解释；但是他们的意见也还有正确的部分，如对生产提出有益的建议，建议减少脱产干部的人数等。对这些好的意见，合作社的组织应该加以研究和采纳。
