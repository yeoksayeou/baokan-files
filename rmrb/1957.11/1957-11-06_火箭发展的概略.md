    The rocket, the foundation for today's artificial Earth satellites, ballistic intercontinental missiles, and future space travel, was invented in our country about nine hundred years ago. This is the pride and glory of the Chinese people. Alchemists of the early Tang Dynasty (7th century AD) invented gunpowder. According to the History of the Song Dynasty, Tang Fu, the captain of the Shenwei Water Army, presented rockets in the third year of Xianping during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Northern Song Dynasty (1000 AD). In the fifth year of Xianping, Shi Pu, the commander of the Jizhou regiment, made firearms such as fireballs and rockets. This principle of using gunpowder combustion to generate reaction thrust was also used in various fireworks toys, such as ground bloomers. During the reign of Emperor Qinzong of the Northern Song Dynasty (1126 AD), when the Jin people invaded Bianjing (Kaifeng, Henan), Song general Yao Zhongyou used rocket weapons to resist the Jin army. Rockets were introduced to Jin and Yuan (Mongol) in the war. During the Southern Song Dynasty, when the Song, Jin, and Yuan fought each other, rockets were a common weapon.
    Around the 13th century, the rockets invented in our country were introduced to Europe through Arab hands. To this day, records of ancient Chinese rockets can still be found in ancient Arabic books. Tsarist Russia began to have rockets in the 17th century, and India also used rockets in the 18th century. At this time, rockets were all for military use. In the mid-19th century, the Russian Konstantin Konstantinov improved rocket technology, making rockets one of the most effective weapons at the time.
    At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, the great Soviet scientist Tsiolkovsky made tremendous contributions to rocket science and technology. He proposed the design of liquid rockets and established the theoretical basis for using multi-stage rockets to achieve space travel. After the victory of the great October Revolution, with the care and support of the Soviet Communist Party and Lenin, Tsiolkovsky's scientific research career was greatly developed, and a new generation of Soviet rocket propulsion talents was cultivated, laying a solid foundation for today's great leap forward.
    In Western Europe, French engineer Esnault-Pelterie conducted theoretical research on space travel in the 1920s. Professor Goddard of the United States also began rocket research around the same time. In 1926, he launched the first liquid-fueled rocket. He did a lot of useful experiments in rockets. In 1937, Professor von Karman and Chinese scientist Qian Xuesen both conducted rocket experiments and research in the United States. However, their research did not receive much attention from the U.S. government at the time. In Germany, Professor Oberth was one of the earliest researchers of rockets, and he published a book on space travel in 1923. The characteristic of rocket development in Western Europe and the United States during this period (between World War I and World War II) was that the government did not pay attention to it. Rocket research was mostly carried out by private forces, with little success.
    The rapid development of rockets roughly began during World War II. After the Nazi Party seized power in Germany in the 1930s, it vigorously prepared for war and engaged in the research of military rockets. During the war, the famous V-2 rocket was made. After the fall of Nazi Germany, V-2 designer Professor Braun was recruited by the United States to work in the United States. After the end of World War II, due to the rapid development of modern sciences such as radio electronics, automatic control, and fuel science, rockets have made unprecedented progress. The Soviet Union is far ahead of the world. The ballistic intercontinental missile launched by the Soviet Union at the end of August this year, the world's first artificial satellite launched on October 4, and the second heavier, larger, and more complex satellite launched on November 3, have brought mankind into a brand new era—the era of space travel.

    火箭发展的概略
    ·礼·
    作为今天人造地球卫星、弹道式洲际导弹和未来宇宙航行基础的火箭，是大约在九百多年前，在我国发明的。这是我们中国人民的骄傲和光荣。唐朝初年（公元七世纪）炼丹家发明了火药。据宋史记载，北宋真宗咸平三年（公元1000年）神卫水军队长唐福献火箭。咸平五年冀州团练史石普制火球火箭等火器。这种利用火药燃烧面产生反作用推力的原理，并曾用于各种烟火玩具如起花等。北宋钦宗时代（公元1126年）金人入侵汴京（河南开封），宋将姚仲友曾用火箭武器抗击金军。在战争中火箭传入金和元（蒙古）。南宋时代宋、金、元三国交兵时，火箭是一种常用的武器。
    大约在十三世纪，我国发明的火箭通过阿拉伯人之手传入欧洲。至今在阿拉伯的古书里还可以找到中国古代火箭的记载。十七世纪沙皇俄国开始有了火箭，十八世纪印度也使用了火箭。这时火箭都是军用的。十九世纪中叶俄国的康士坦丁诺夫改进了火箭技术，使火箭成为当时最有效的武器之一。
    十九世纪末二十世纪初，苏联的伟大科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基对火箭科学技术作了巨大的贡献。他提出了液体火箭的设计方案，建立了使用多级火箭达成宇宙航行的理论基础。伟大的十月革命胜利以后，在苏联共产党和列宁的关怀、支持下，齐奥尔科夫斯基的科学研究事业得到了巨大的发展，培养了年青一代的苏联火箭喷气人才，为今日的跃进打下了坚固的基础。
    在西欧，法国的工程师艾斯劳特·贝尔德利在本世纪二十年代进行了有关宇宙航行的理论研究。美国的高达德教授约于同时也开始进行了火箭的研究工作。1926年他射出了第一只液体燃料火箭。他在火箭方面做了很多有用的实验。1937年卡门教授和我国科学家钱学森都曾在美国进行过火箭的试验和研究。但当时他们的研究并未得到美国政府的重视。在德国，研究火箭较早的是奥波特教授，1923年他出版了有关宇宙航行的著作。西欧和美国这一时期（第一次和第二次世界大战之间）的火箭发展的特点是，政府不重视。火箭的研究工作多半靠私人的力量进行，成效很小。
    火箭的大踏步发展大致起于第二次世界大战期间。德国纳粹党在三十年代篡夺政权以后，极力准备战争，从事军用火箭的研究。在战争年代制成了著名的V—2火箭。纳粹德国复灭后，V—2设计者布朗恩教授为美国搜罗，到美国工作。第二次世界大战结束后，由于现代科学如无线电电子学、自动控制学、燃料科学等的迅速发展，火箭得到了前所未有的巨大进步。远远走在全世界最前列的是苏联。苏联在今年8月底发射的弹道式洲际导弹，10月4日发射的世界第一颗人造卫星，和11月3日发射的第二颗更重、更大、更复杂的卫星，更把人类带进了一个崭新的时代——宇宙航行的时代。
