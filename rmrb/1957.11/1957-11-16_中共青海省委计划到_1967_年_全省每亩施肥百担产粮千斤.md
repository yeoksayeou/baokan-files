Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 14th - The CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee, at its Second Fourth Plenary Committee (Enlarged) Meeting held from October 25th to November 11th, proposed that by 1967, every mu of cultivated land in the province should be fertilized with 100 loads of fertilizer, and produce 1,000 jin of grain.

The meeting analyzed the favorable conditions for developing agricultural production in Qinghai Province, believing that although Qinghai Province is a plateau with crisscrossing mountains, a dry and cold climate, little rainfall, and a short frost-free period; it has abundant surface and ground water, with 214 rivers and streams of all sizes that can be utilized, and many dry lands can be transformed into paddy fields. At the same time, the land here is fertile, and there is long sunshine; the cooperativized farmers have boundless potential to unleash. Cadres from the grassroots reported at the meeting many facts and experiences of greatly increased grain production. For example, the "915" First Cooperative of Xinzhuang Township, Datong County, created a record of 1,286 jin of broad beans per mu this year due to opening up water sources, increasing application of manure, and intensive cultivation. On the grasslands of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the Tangnaihai Forward Cooperative in the small agricultural area of Xinghai County, members of the Han, Hui, Tibetan, Tu, and Salar ethnic groups, utilizing sufficient water and fertile land, through hard work, overcame natural disasters such as wind, drought, floods, frost, and insects, and achieved a bumper harvest, obtaining an average yield of 1,023 jin of wheat per mu on more than seven mu of land. Encouraged by a large number of increased production facts, the meeting proposed that in the next ten years, the area of paddy fields should be developed from the current 1.71 million mu to 6 million mu, and the grain output should be increased from the current 1.2 billion jin to 4 billion jin. The main measures to increase production are to vigorously build small-scale water conservancy projects and carry out soil and water conservation work, and to tap fertilizer sources. In this regard, many agricultural cooperatives have already created many experiences. Dazhuang Hui Township in Minhe County is a mountainous area with high and steep terrain, a dry climate, and a lack of water sources. Before cooperativization, it only had two mu of irrigated land. Since the implementation of cooperativization, by building small reservoirs, digging wells, blocking dams, digging water storage ponds, and opening canals to divert water up the mountains, the irrigated area has now been developed to 750 mu, and the yield per mu has increased from 110 jin to more than 200 jin. Huangzhong County is a mountainous area with hills and ravines. In addition to building small canals, erecting aqueducts, installing waterwheels, pumping machines, and digging springs, in the past two years, they have also built water storage ponds, cattle wallows, field ditches, valley terraces, and enclosed mountains for afforestation and tree planting, which resulted in maintaining soil and water, and the irrigated area has been developed to more than 110,000 mu.

In terms of tapping fertilizer sources, this meeting also exchanged many experiences. In addition to accumulating human and animal manure, some use wild grass and garbage to make compost, some dig up old soil from the streets, some use kang soil and wall soil, and some have also created a "high-temperature composting" method. The meeting proposed the slogan of "10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, 1,000 jin of grain" by 1967 as a goal to strive for.

In order to strengthen the leadership over agricultural and animal husbandry production, overcome the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leading organs, and train cadres, the meeting decided to send more than 16,000 cadres and staff members to lower levels throughout the province, including 21 department and ministerial-level cadres.

The meeting also discussed work in pastoral areas, deciding that animal husbandry production should be vigorously developed in pastoral areas, and at the same time, socialist transformation should be carried out in a differentiated manner according to different regions, with conditions, plans, and steps.

    中共青海省委计划到1967年
    全省每亩施肥百担产粮千斤
    新华社西宁14日电　中共青海省委在10月25日到11月11日召开第二届第四次全体委员会（扩大）会议，提出到1967年，全省每亩耕地施肥料一百担，产粮食一千斤。
    会议分析了青海省发展农业生产的有利条件，认为青海省虽系高原，山脉纵横，气候干寒，降雨量少，无霜期短；但是这里有着丰富的地面水和地下水，全省有大小河溪二百一十四条可以利用，有很多旱地可以变成水地；同时，这里的土地肥沃，日照长；合作化了的农民有着无穷的潜力可以发挥。来自基层的干部在会上报告了许多粮食大大增产的事实和经验。如大通县新庄乡“九一五”一社今年由于开辟了水源、增施粪肥、精耕细作，创造了亩产蚕豆一千二百八十六斤的纪录。在海南藏族自治州的草原上，兴海县小块农业区的唐乃亥前进社，汉、回、藏、土、撒拉族的社员们，利用着充足的水和肥沃的土地，经过辛勤劳动，战胜了风、旱、洪、霜、虫等自然灾害，获得了丰收，并在七亩多土地上获得小麦每亩平均一千零二十三斤的产量。在大量的增产事实的鼓舞下，会议提出在今后十年内，由现在的一百七十一万亩水地发展到六百万亩水地，粮食产量由现在的十二亿多斤增加到四十亿斤。增产的主要措施，一是大力兴修小型水利工程和开展水土保持工作，一是挖掘肥源。在这方面，不少农业社已经创造了许许多多的经验。民和县大庄回族乡是一个地势高陡，气候干燥，水源缺乏的山区，合作化以前，只有两亩水浇地，自从实现合作化以后，修筑小水库、打井、堵坝、挖涝池、开渠道引水上山等，现在水浇地已发展到七百五十亩，每亩产量由一百一十斤增加到二百多斤。湟中县是个山岭沟壑的山区，原有水地八万亩，两年来除兴修小型渠道、架渡槽、安装水车、抽水机、挖泉眼而外，还修了涝池、卧牛坑、地头沟、谷坊和封山育草、植树造林的结果，保持了水土，水地发展到十一万多亩。
    在挖掘肥源方面，这次会议也交流了很多经验。除积攒人、畜粪尿外，有的利用野草、垃圾沤肥，有挖街道上的陈土，有的利用炕土、墙土，有的还创造了“高温堆肥”的方法。会议提出到1967年每亩“万斤肥料，千斤粮”的口号，做为奋斗目标。
    为了加强对农业和牧业生产的领导，克服领导机关的官僚主义和主观主义，锻炼干部，会议决定全省下放干部、职工一万六千多人，其中有二十一个厅长和部长级干部。
    会议还讨论了牧区工作，决定在牧区要努力发展畜牧业生产，同时分别不同地区有条件、有计划、有步骤地进行社会主义改造。
