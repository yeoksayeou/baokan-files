    On the Bus	Wu Zhongheng
    Right outside my door is a bus stop. Although it was a holiday, there weren't many people waiting for the bus. After a while, an old man and a child walked over. The old man said:
    "My eyes are blurry, they're not working well. You keep an eye out."
    That old man was at least sixty years old, and the child was no more than twelve or thirteen.
    In the distance, a rather nice-looking flat-nosed bus was coming. The child quickly grabbed his grandfather's hand, pointing and saying:
    "Look, Grandpa. It's here, it's here."
    The old man shielded his eyes from the sun, looking towards the bus. After the bus stopped, the child shouted:
    "No, Grandpa, it's not it."
    "It's not? If it's not, we won't take it."
    The people standing in front of the old man all boarded the bus. But he took a step back and said to the people behind him:
    "Comrades, you get on the bus, I won't take this one."
    All the people who wanted to get on had boarded. The conductor asked:
    "Old man, are you getting on the bus?"
    The old man shook his head.
    The old man said to his grandson:
    "Look carefully, don't miss it."
    Two more buses drove away, and they still hadn't boarded. I started to feel strange. Were they waiting for someone? It didn't seem like it. Waiting for the bus? It seemed even less likely.
    After standing for a while, the old man seemed a little tired. I moved the stool I was sitting on over to him. I said to him:
    "Old man, you're tired, take a rest!"
    "Thank you, comrade." He nodded to me and sat down.
    "Are you waiting for someone?"
    "No." He smiled: "Waiting for the bus."
    Another bus came, and they still didn't get on. I felt even stranger.
    "Old man, you say you're waiting for the bus, why don't you get on?"
    The child said: "My grandpa wants to ride..."
    "Don't interrupt. You listen when adults are talking." The old man turned to me and said: "It's like this, comrade. I heard that there are buses made in our own country on this route. They're called Liberation brand." The old man said with satisfaction, "I've lived for almost seventy years, and I've ridden all kinds of cars, big and small. But I've never ridden a car made in our own country."
    Another bus came up ahead. It looked the same as the ones that had already passed, red and yellow body, flat front. But before the bus had even stopped, the child shouted: "Grandpa, look, this is the Liberation brand." "Is it?" The old man stood up hurriedly.
    I looked over, and sure enough, there was a small round plate on the front of the bus with two golden characters: "Liberation." My interest was also piqued. I said:
    "Old man, I'll go with you for a ride on the Liberation brand."
    Although there weren't many people on the bus, all the seats were taken. As soon as the old man got on the bus, a young girl in the seat near the driver stood up and offered her seat to the old man.
    The bus started moving. I stood next to the old man. He listened carefully for a while, then touched it with his hand. Later, he stared intently at the driver—a rather young lad. Judging by the old man's expression, it was as if he were inspecting the work.
    "How is it?" I asked him with a smile.
    "Good, good." He gave a thumbs up and exclaimed: "I can tell by the sound of the engine that it's a very good machine."
    I never thought he was an expert. He said to me softly:
    "Comrade, you don't know, when I was young, I also drove cars, I drove all kinds of Fords, Dodges, and Austins. I drove for more than ten years..." "Old man, where are we going?" I asked him while taking out money to buy a ticket.
    "Where to?" He thought for a moment and said: "To the end! When we get to the last stop, let's not get off. We'll take this bus back, what do you think?"
    The Liberation brand bus sped along the smooth road. A satisfied, almost proud smile appeared on the old man's wrinkled face.

    在公共汽车上	吴仲衡
    在我家的大门外就是公共汽车站，这天虽然是假日，但等车的人并不多。一会儿，走过来一老一小两个人，老人说：
    “我的眼睛花了，不管用，你看着点。”
    那位老大爷，至少也有六十岁了，那个小孩也不过十二、三岁。
    远远的来了一辆挺漂亮的平头公共汽车。孩子连忙拉着他爷爷的手，指着说：
    “快看，爷爷。来了，来了。”
    老大爷用手遮着阳光朝汽车望着。汽车停妥以后，那小孩就嚷着：
    “不是，爷爷，不是的。”
    “不是？不是咱们就不坐。”
    站在老大爷前面的人都上车了。可是，他往后退了一步，对后面的人说：
    “同志，你们上车吧，我不坐这个。”
    上车的人都上完了。售票员问：
    “老大爷，上不上车？”
    老大爷摇了摇头。
    老大爷对他的孙子说：
    “要看仔细，可别错过了。”
    又有两辆汽车开走了，他们仍未上车。我奇怪起来，他们等人？不像。等车吗？更不像。
    站了一会儿，老大爷好像有点累了。我把我坐的凳子搬过去。对他说：
    “老大爷，累了，歇会儿吧！”
    “谢谢你，同志。”他对我点了点头，就坐下了。
    “您是等人吗？”
    “不是。”他笑了笑：“等车。”
    又一辆汽车来了，他们仍不上去，我更奇怪起来。
    “老大爷，你说等车，干吗不上去？”
    孩子说：“我爷爷他一定要坐……”
    “别打岔。大人说话，你听着。”老大爷回过头来对我说：“是这么回事，同志。我听说，在这条路上有咱们中国自己造的公共汽车。叫解放牌。”老大爷满意地说，“我活了快七十年了，坐过各种各样的汽车，大的，小的。可就是没有坐过咱们中国自己造的汽车。”
    前面又来了一辆汽车。看样子和已经开过去的一样，红黄色的车身，平平的车头。可是，车还没有停住，孩子就叫了起来：“爷爷，快看，这就是解放牌。”“是吗？”老大爷匆忙地站了起来。
    我看过去，可不是，车头上有一块小圆牌，上面有两个金黄色的字：“解放”。这一下，我的兴趣也被引起来了。我说：
    “老大爷，我也陪你去坐一回解放牌。”
    在汽车上，人虽然不多，但坐位都已经坐满了。老大爷刚一上车，在靠司机座的位子上就有一个年青的姑娘站了起来，让座给老人。
    车开动起来了。我站在老大爷的身边，他一会儿侧耳听听，一会儿又用手摸摸，后来，他两只眼睛又全神贯注地望着那个司机——这是一个挺年青的小伙子。看老人的神气，好像他是在检查工作似的。
    “怎么样？”我笑着问他。
    “好，好。”他伸着大拇指赞叹着：“我一听这发动机的声音就知道，挺好的机器。”
    我怎么也没有想到他还是个内行。他轻轻地对我说：
    “同志，你不知道，年青的时候，我也开过汽车，什么福特、道奇、奥斯汀我全都开过。整整地开了十多年……”“老大爷，我们到哪儿？”我一面掏钱买票一面问他。
    “到哪儿？”他想了一想说：“到底！到了末站，咱们甭下车了，还坐这辆车回来，你看怎么样？”
    解放牌的汽车在平滑的马路上飞驰着。一种满足的、几乎是带着骄傲的笑容出现在老大爷那布满了皱纹的脸上。
