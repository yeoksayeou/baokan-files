(According to Xinhua News Agency)

Mangshi, a famous border town in the subtropical region of Yunnan Province, has basically eliminated malaria. Seven years ago, when the first People's Liberation Army troops arrived at the border, many people in the streets of Mangshi and nearby villages were seen with yellow skin, emaciated bodies, and large bellies, shivering in the summer sun while hugging stoves due to malaria attacks. According to investigations by epidemic prevention personnel, there used to be more than fifty kinds of mosquitoes here, and there were also many types of malaria. Cerebral malaria, in particular, could kill patients within a few hours. The severity of malaria was rare in the world. Until 1953, the incidence rate still accounted for 60%. However, now you can no longer see people with protruding bellies due to enlarged spleens. This year, only seven people in the city contracted malaria, and no patients died. Now, people carrying malaria parasites account for only 2% of the total population, and diagnosis and treatment are continuing.

Mangshi is the capital of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture. Currently, several subtropical plains and market towns, including Nujiang Dam and Wanting, have also basically eradicated malaria throughout the prefecture.

    芒市基本上消灭疟疾
    云南省亚热带地区的边疆名镇——芒市，已基本上消灭了疟疾。七年前，当第一支解放军部队来到国境边上的时候，芒市街头和附近的村庄里，可以看见有许多人面黄肌瘦、肚子很大，因为疟疾发作而抱着火炉蹲在盛夏的阳光下发抖。据防疫人员的调查，这里过去有五十多种蚊子，疟疾的种类也很多，其中的脑性疟疾，几小时内就使患者死亡。疟疾的严重情况在世界上也是少有。直到1953年，发病率仍占60％。可是，现在这里再也看不到因为脾脏肿大而凸起肚子的人了，今年全市发疟疾的人只有七个，没有一个患者死亡。现在带疟原虫的人只占总人口的2％，正在继续诊治。
    芒市是德宏傣族景颇族自治州的首府。现在，全州基本上扑灭了疟疾的还有怒江坝、畹町等几个亚热带小平原和集镇。
