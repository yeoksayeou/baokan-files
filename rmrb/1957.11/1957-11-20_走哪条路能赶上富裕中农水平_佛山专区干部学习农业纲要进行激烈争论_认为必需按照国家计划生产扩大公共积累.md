Which Road Leads to the Level of a Prosperous Middle Peasant?
Foshan Special District Cadres Engage in Fierce Debate While Studying the Agricultural Program
Believing That Production Must Follow National Plans and Expand Public Accumulation

The activist conference in Foshan Special District, Guangdong Province, with 1,800 participants, engaged in a fierce debate on which path to take to catch up with the level of prosperous middle peasants while studying the Agricultural Development Program.

Everyone agreed with the goal of catching up with prosperous middle peasants in three to five years. However, there were two opposing views on how to achieve this goal. The first view was that production should not be subject to national plans, and should not focus on grain. Instead, they should engage in whatever is most profitable. It also advocated that agricultural cooperatives should distribute more and accumulate less, relying on national loans for production. The other view was the opposite.

Many people initially agreed with the first view. Representatives from the plains area said that they had little land and a large population. Even if grain production increased, the low grain prices meant that their income would not increase much. They had to convert rice paddies to grow high-priced sugarcane, or convert them into fish ponds for aquaculture. Representatives from low-lying areas believed that frequent flooding made it better to engage in sideline occupations such as catching fish and shrimp. Some representatives even said: "Producing according to the national plan, we won't catch up with prosperous middle peasants even if we fly in an airplane; if we don't follow the national plan, we guarantee that we will catch up in one year."

The debate was very heated. Representatives from agricultural cooperatives that had taken this path this year cited facts to oppose this view. Last year, the Tangbu Cooperative in Sanshui County did not follow the national plan and privately converted rice paddies to grow high-priced water chestnuts. As a result, they could not sell them and lost several thousand catties of grain. Some cooperatives in Nanhai County saw that stiff silkworms (a Chinese medicine) were priced high, and disregarded the national plan, converting large quantities of silkworms into stiff silkworms. Many cooperatives did this, but the state did not need so much, and many cooperatives lost money. Representatives from Shunde County calculated several losses: first, the area of rice paddies converted to sugarcane in the county this year was almost double the national plan, resulting in a shortage of rations (because grain was already supplied in fixed quantities). Second, because too much land was planted with sugarcane, the county's peanut planting plan was not completed, and the county would have 17,000 catties less oil to eat. Representatives from Xinhui County said: "Only focusing on profit is like wearing only a long gown without pants. Maybe next year we will become poor peasants again."

Is it impossible to catch up with the income of prosperous middle peasants in the short term if we adhere to the premise of following the national plan and focusing on planting grain crops while developing diversified operations? Representatives from various types of regions presented many affirmative facts. The Dongzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Panyu County, which has a lot of sandy land, has been diligent and thrifty since its establishment in 1955. It replaced gasoline lamps with small kerosene lamps, made its own cow ropes, and repaired and manufactured its own farm tools. As a result, production costs have been reduced by more than 50% year after year. The money saved was used to buy horse-drawn carts to "march" to Guangzhou to haul fertilizer to improve the soil. As a result, it went from being a grain-deficient cooperative to a grain-surplus cooperative last year. This year's summer harvest distribution increased by 63% compared to the same period last year, greatly exceeding the income of prosperous middle peasants.

The representatives then discussed another view, which was that cooperatives should distribute more and accumulate less, mainly relying on national loans for production.

Can this be done to catch up with the income of prosperous middle peasants? Some cooperatives presented facts of failure. These cooperatives implemented a "divide everything" policy last year and this summer, even dividing grain seeds, vegetable seeds, unharvested vegetables, and piglets in the womb into cash. As for production funds, the Xiana Cooperative in Panyu County did not even have the money to buy iron nails for repairing water conservancy projects; the Yisqian First Cooperative in Xinhui County had only a few jiao (one-tenth of a yuan) left in its treasury, and even the sows went hungry.

The situation of the Shiban Cooperative in Shunde County was the opposite. This cooperative was originally a "third-category" cooperative, and a large number of members threatened to withdraw last year. However, the cooperative cadres gritted their teeth and accumulated 10,000 yuan, built pigsties and silkworm houses. The number of pigs raised this year increased from four last year to four hundred. The yield of fish ponds also increased from 300 catties per mu last year to 400 catties, and the yield of sugarcane increased from 600 catties per mu to 1,000 catties. In another year, production and income can catch up with prosperous middle peasants.

Next, the representatives analyzed that the path to prosperity for many prosperous middle peasants also relied on diligent accumulation and long-term planning. A well-to-do middle peasant in Heshan County had not been to a teahouse for twenty years. Another well-to-do middle peasant in the county named Liang Qiaorui started a fifteen-year plan to plant fir trees in 1929. Huang Quan, a well-to-do middle peasant in Nanhai County, used 53% of his income in 1948 for production expenses and expanded accumulation. Representatives from Shunde County said: "Our well-to-do middle peasants often maintain three sets of funds: production, living, and turnover. But our cooperative members go to the teahouse once or twice a day, which is really inappropriate."

After the debate, the representatives expressed that they must produce according to the national plan to reach the income level of prosperous middle peasants. All representatives agreed to increase grain yield per mu to 800 catties within five years. Many cooperatives also revised their autumn harvest distribution plans to increase the proportion of public accumulation.

    走哪条路能赶上富裕中农水平
    佛山专区干部学习农业纲要进行激烈争论
    认为必需按照国家计划生产扩大公共积累
    新华社广州专电　广东省佛山专区一千八百人参加的积极分子大会，在学习农业发展纲要时，激烈地争辩了走哪条道路才能赶上富裕中农水平的问题。
    争取三、五年内赶上富裕中农，大家对这个指标没有意见。但是对用什么办法达到这一指标，却有针锋相对的两种主张。第一种主张是生产不要服从国家计划，不要以粮食为主，什么赚钱多就经营什么。并且主张农业社多分少积累，依靠国家贷款搞生产。另一种主张则相反。
    不少人开头是附和第一种主张的。平原区的代表说，他们那里地少人多，粮食增产了但粮价低，收入增加不了多少，非将稻田改种价高的甘蔗，或改为水塘养鱼不可。低洼地区的代表认为经常闹涝灾，不如多搞捉鱼虾等副业。有些代表甚至说：“按国家计划生产，坐飞机也赶不上富裕中农；不按国家计划，担保一年就赶上。”
    大家辩论很热烈，今年曾走过这条路的农业社代表们，列举事实反对这种主张。三水县塘布社去年不按国家计划，私自将稻田改种了价高的荸荠，结果销不出去，亏了几千斤谷。南海县的一些社看到僵蚕（中药）价高，就不顾国家计划，将蚕大批改制了僵蚕，很多社都搞，结果国家要不了，许多社都赔了本。顺德县代表算了几笔损失账：第一，今年全县稻田改种甘蔗的面积，比国家计划多了近一倍，由此缺了很多口粮（因粮食已定量供应）。第二，种蔗地过多，没有完成今年花生种植计划，全县要少吃油一万七千斤。新会县的代表说：一味贪利，好比只穿长衫不穿裤，也许明年又会变贫农。”
    是不是服从国家计划，以种植粮食作物为主的前提下开展多种经营，就不能在短期内赶上富裕中农的收入，各种类型地区的代表又摆出许多肯定的事实。土地多沙的番禺县东庄农业社，从1955年建社开始就克勤克俭，汽油灯改用小煤油灯，牛绳自编，农具自修自制，因此，连年生产成本降低50％以上。省下的钱就买了马车，“远征”到广州拉肥改良土壤。这样，去年就由缺粮社变成余粮社。今年夏收分配又比去年同期增加了63％，大大超过了富裕中农的收入。
    代表们又讨论另一种主张，就是要社多分少积累，主要靠国家贷款搞生产。
    能不能这样来赶上富裕中农的收入呢？一些社又摆出了失败的事实。这些社在去年和今夏都曾实行“分光”政策，连谷种、菜种、未收成的菜、正在母胎的猪仔也折款分了。而生产资金呢，番禺县夏南社连买修水利买铁钉的钱也没有；新会县司前乡第一社的银库里只剩几角钱，连母猪也挨了饿。
    顺德县仕板社的情况却与此相反。这个社原属“三类”社，去年大批社员闹退社。但社干部咬住牙根积累了一万元，建了猪舍和蚕房，今年养的猪从去年的四头增加到四百头。鱼塘也从去年每亩三百斤增加到四百斤，甘蔗每亩从六百斤增加到一千斤。再过一年，生产和收入都可以赶上富裕中农。
    接着，代表们分析许多富裕中农的发家道路也是靠勤俭积累、有长远打算的。鹤山县一个上中农二十年从不上茶楼。这个县另一个叫梁桥瑞的上中农，从1929年就开始了一个十五年的种杉计划。南海县上中农黄权在1948年的收入中，有53％是用来作生产费用和扩大积累用的。顺德县代表说：“我们那里上中农是经常保持生产、生活和周转三套资金的。但我们的社员却每天上一两次茶楼，实在太不该。”
    辩论后，代表们纷纷表示一定要按照国家计划去生产，去达到富裕中农的收入水平。所有代表同意在五年内将每亩粮食产量提高到八百斤。不少社还修订了秋收分配方案，扩大了公共积累的比量。
