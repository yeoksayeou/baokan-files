    Combining Winter Production to Prevent Schistosomiasis
    Hunan and Hubei are Systematically Carrying Out Prevention Work Under Leadership
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Hunan Province is currently launching a comprehensive schistosomiasis prevention campaign in conjunction with winter production.
    The tasks for schistosomiasis prevention in Hunan Province this winter and next spring are: to create a mass snail eradication movement, making sixty townships across the province essentially snail-free; to treat 60,000 patients, and effectively combine this with individual protection and fecal management, and other preventive measures.
    By mid-October, the province had tilled over 166,000 mu of snail-infested areas, planting rapeseed, broad beans, green manure, and other crops to eliminate snails. Yueyang and Linxiang counties jointly organized more than 3,000 laborers to build dikes and cultivate land in the adjacent Ba Jiao Lake. This will spare members of dozens of nearby agricultural cooperatives from the threat of schistosomiasis infection when cutting lake grass, and will also expand the cultivated area by more than 20,000 mu, preventing floods from inundating 5,000 mu of paddy fields. Treatment efforts in various areas are also progressing rapidly. According to incomplete statistics, the province has already admitted more than 5,000 patients. After more than a month of effort, Xiangpulin and Shatou townships in Yiyang County have essentially eliminated schistosomiasis.
    The Provincial Committee's Leading Group for Prevention has organized five inspection teams at the end of October, and dispatched them to various areas for inspections to ensure the in-depth development of the comprehensive campaign. (Lu An)
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 15th. Rural areas in Hubei Province are extensively carrying out schistosomiasis prevention activities in conjunction with winter water conservancy construction and manure accumulation.
    While repairing dikes and building sluice gates, Huangpi, Hanyang, and Hanchuan counties have basically eradicated snails from more than 200,000 mu of land. Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingzhou regions are combining land reclamation, manure accumulation, and water conservancy construction to eliminate snails on more than 300,000 mu of farmland, and are beginning to promote fecal management and safe water usage in approximately a thousand agricultural cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives in various areas have also arranged treatment schedules based on the characteristics of winter production. This winter, they plan to treat more than 90,000 patients in rotation. Jingzhou Prefecture has recently admitted more than 4,000 patients. All prevention station and team personnel in various areas have been fully engaged in prevention work. In addition, more than 500 professionals have been trained, and a large number of district and township health workers have been mobilized to participate. Since Hubei Province began planned schistosomiasis prevention last year, it has cured 140,000 schistosomiasis patients. The prevention and eradication of disease sources is also being widely carried out in epidemic areas, with snails basically eliminated on approximately 540,000 mu of land. Xiangyang and Gucheng counties, and 66 snail-free townships, have emerged. Fecal management and safe water usage have been widely promoted in nearly half of the epidemic areas. Individual protection has also been given attention by the broad masses. According to the recently revised provincial prevention plan, Hubei Province will basically eliminate schistosomiasis during the Second Five-Year Plan period and cure 200,000 schistosomiasis patients in 1958.

    结合冬季生产防治血吸虫病
    湖南、湖北正有领导地全面进行防治工作
    本报讯　湖南省正结合冬季生产展开全面性的防治血吸虫病工作。
    湖南省今冬明春血吸虫病防治工作任务是：要求造成一个群众性的灭螺运动，使全省六十个乡成为基本无螺乡；要治疗六万病人，并妥善结合做好个体防护、粪便管理等预防工作。
    到10月中旬，全省已翻耕十六万六千多亩钉螺面积，种上了油菜、蚕豆、绿肥等作物以消灭钉螺。岳阳、临湘两县还联合组织了三千多民工在两县两邻的芭蕉湖进行围堤垦植，可使附近数十个农业社的社员，在打湖草时，免去了感染血吸虫病的威胁，而且能扩大耕地面积二万余亩，使五千亩水田不受水淹。各地治疗工作的进展也很快，据不完全统计：全省已收治病人五千多名。益阳县经过一个多月的战斗，已经有香铺仑、沙头两个乡做到了基本消灭血吸虫病。
    省委防治领导小组已于10月底组织了五个检查组，分到各地巡回检查，使全面战斗得以深入开展。　　（麓安）
    新华社武汉15日电　湖北省的农村结合冬季兴修水利和积肥，广泛展开防治血吸虫病的活动。
    黄陂、汉阳和汉川等县在修堤、建闸的同时，已把二十多万亩土地上的钉螺基本消灭干净，黄冈、孝感和荆州等地区正结合开荒、积肥和兴修水利，在三十多万亩田地上消灭钉螺，约在上千个农业社里开始推行粪便管理和安全用水工作。各地农业合作社还根据冬季生产特点，安排了治疗工作，今冬准备轮流治疗九万多个病人，荆州专区最近已经收治了四千多个病人。各地的防治站、组工作人员已经全部投入防治工作。此外还训练了五百多个专业人员和动员了大批区、乡卫生人员参加。湖北省从去年开始有计划地防治血吸虫病以来，已经治愈了十四万血吸虫病患者。预防和扑灭病源的工作也正在疫区广泛开展，约在五十四万亩土地上基本消灭了钉螺，出现了襄阳、谷城两个无螺县和六十六个无螺乡。将近一半的疫区普遍推行了粪便管理和安全用水工作。个人防护也已经为广大群众重视起来。根据最近修订的全省防治工作规划，在第二个五年计划时期内，湖北省将基本上消灭血吸虫病，并在1958年内治愈二十万血吸虫病人。
