Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: TASS, Rome, November 24th: "Unità" published Egyptian President Nasser's conversation with Italian Communist Party leaders, including Spano, who recently visited some Near East countries.

Answering Spano's questions, Nasser said that Egypt's national revolution and the Arab people's liberation movement have received the full support of the vast majority of the Egyptian people. He said, "Our main support comes from farmers, workers, and the national bourgeoisie. Those who oppose the revolution are the shameful old politicians, feudal lords, capitalists, and privileged individuals who rely on foreign forces and usually determine their political line based on personal interests."

Nasser continued, "Abroad, the enemies of our national revolution are the imperialists and their servants and partners. All those who yearn for freedom, all those who have recently gained freedom, and the entire socialist camp are our friends. Until now, I have not found any indication that the Soviet Union wants to interfere in our internal affairs or influence us with any political ideology. We fully maintain the freedom to express our opinions on all issues based on international principles, and we never want to act by considering the interests of a certain group."

President Nasser also said, "The tense situation in the Near East will persist for a long time because someone is trying to implement an imperialist policy of divide and rule against the people."

Answering another question, Nasser said that the Egyptian government is taking measures to "democratize national life." He said, "However, we are taking these measures gradually and cautiously; this is to avoid the danger of a restoration of the old era and to prevent imperialists from taking the opportunity to interfere in our internal affairs."

Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: Baghdad dispatch: Egyptian President Nasser said in an interview with a reporter from the Iraqi newspaper "Al-Bilad" that the threat of war can be avoided by banning atomic weapons and stopping the arms race.

Nasser's remarks were published in Baghdad on the 24th. He also reiterated Egypt's policy of active neutrality.

Nasser said that Egypt is willing to conduct closer cooperation with all Arab countries, provided that "the purpose of this cooperation is not to place any Arab country under foreign influence."

He said that Egypt does not oppose holding a meeting of Arab leaders, but it "does not want Arab unity and cooperation to serve imperialist interests."

Nasser accused imperialist countries and Zionist elements of attempting to undermine Arab unity by sowing discord among Arab countries, especially between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.

He said that Egypt's only condition for cooperation with the West is that "this cooperation does not affect Egypt's sovereignty and independence."

Nasser also said that Egypt has notified Tunisia that it is prepared to supply weapons to the Tunisian army.

    纳赛尔谈埃及民族革命
    帝国主义是敌人社会主义阵营是朋友
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社罗马24日讯：“团结报”刊登了埃及总统纳赛尔向不久前访问了一些近东国家的意大利共产党领导人员斯巴诺发表的谈话。
    纳赛尔在回答斯巴诺的问题时说，埃及的民族革命和阿拉伯人民的解放运动得到了绝大多数埃及人民的全力支持。他说，我们的主要支持力量是农民、工人和民族资产阶级。反对革命的是通常从个人利益出发来决定政治路线的可耻的旧政客、封建主、资本家和依靠外来势力的特权分子。
    纳赛尔接着说，在国外，我们民族革命的敌人是帝国主义者以及他们的仆从和伙伴。一切渴望自由的人们、一切不久前获得自由的人们和整个社会主义阵营都是我们的朋友。直到现在，我丝毫没有发现任何迹象可以说明苏联想要干涉我国内政，和用某种政治思想来影响我们。我们完全保持着根据国际原则来对一切问题发表意见的自由，而决不想考虑某个集团的利益来行动。
    纳赛尔总统还说，“由于有人力图对人民实行分而治之的帝国主义政策，近东的紧张局势还会保持很久”。
    纳赛尔在回答另一个问题时说，埃及政府正在采取措施，使“国家生活民主化”。他说：“但是我们在采取这些措施时是逐步进行的，慎重的；这是为了避免旧时代复辟的危险，为了防止帝国主义者乘机干涉我们的内政”。
    新华社25日讯　巴格达消息：埃及总统纳赛尔在接见伊拉克“国家报”记者时说，可以通过禁止原子武器和停止军备竞赛来避免战争威胁。
    纳赛尔的这番谈话于24日在巴格达发表。他还重申埃及的积极中立政策。
    纳赛尔说，埃及愿同所有的阿拉伯国家进行更密切的合作，条件是“这种合作的目的不是把任何阿拉伯国家置于外国势力之下”。
    他说，埃及不反对举行阿拉伯国家领袖会议，但是，它“不愿意阿拉伯的团结和合作为帝国主义利益服务”。
    纳赛尔指责帝国主义国家和犹太复国主义分子企图以挑拨阿拉伯国家之间特别是埃及、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚之间的猜忌，来破坏阿拉伯团结。
    他说，埃及同西方合作的唯一条件是，“这种合作不影响埃及的主权和独立”。
    纳赛尔还说，埃及已经通知突尼斯，它准备向突尼斯军队供应武器。
