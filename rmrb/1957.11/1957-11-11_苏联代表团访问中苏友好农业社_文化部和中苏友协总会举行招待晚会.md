    代表团团员、苏联唐波夫州的一个集体农庄女主席安德烈耶娃给农业社的社员们带来了苏联全体庄员的热烈问候。她还代表苏联各界代表团把一架收音机赠送给中苏友好农业生产合作社。
    这个农业生产合作社的副主任陈凤山代表全体社员欢迎苏联贵宾。陈凤山还代表全体社员把一筐萝?和一袋花生送给贵宾们。
    在欢迎大会以后，贵宾们访问了社员的家庭，参观了社员们种的大白菜，参观了合作社的小学和商店，最后还同合作社的负责人进行座谈。
    新华社10日讯　文化部和中苏友好协会总会10日晚在政协礼堂举行京剧晚会，招待以安德烈耶夫为首的苏联各界参加中国人民庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念代表团。
    安德烈耶夫团长和代表团其他贵宾今晚由朱德副主席和苏联驻中国大使馆临时代办顾悌克夫等人陪同，观看了著名京剧演员李少春、袁世海、杜近芳等演出的全部“野猪林”，应邀参加的还有在北京的苏联其他代表团和苏联专家们。
    各国驻华使节也应邀参加。
    陪同观剧的还有李济深、彭真、贺龙、陈毅、张闻天和吴玉章等。
