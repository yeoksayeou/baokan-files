    In accordance with the International Geophysical Year's research plan on atmospheric science and the study of physical processes and living conditions in outer space, the Soviet Union successfully launched its second artificial Earth satellite on November 3. The launch of this satellite is a continuation of the launch of the first Soviet artificial Earth satellite and a further development of the scientific achievements of the first artificial Earth satellite. Without a doubt, this is also the result of the high achievements of various scientific and technological fields in the Soviet Union.
    The design, manufacture, and launch of artificial Earth satellites are extremely complex scientific and technological problems, and also the sum of many important modern scientific and technological achievements. It must be successful on the basis of the highly developed physics, chemistry, mathematics, structural mechanics, aerodynamics, flight vehicle dynamics, rocket engines, automatic control, fuel, materials, technology, astronomy, and meteorology sciences. Taking the structure of the rocket that sends the artificial Earth satellite into the sky as an example, the rocket engine needs to have a shell made of light metal, rare metal alloys, or plastic materials that can withstand high temperatures of over 3,000 degrees. Because the rocket flies at a very high speed, the resistance of the air in the atmosphere will turn part of the kinetic energy of the rocket's flight into heat energy, and the rocket's outer shell also needs to be made of materials that can withstand high temperatures. Roughly speaking, the acquisition of these materials is the result of highly researched achievements in metal physics, metallurgy, chemical engineering, and other sciences, and it is not something that has been solved in the past, let alone something that scientists from all countries can currently do. Even with these materials, and even with engines and automatic control systems, the problem is not completely solved. For example, the rocket's outer shell needs to be designed to be light, strong, and sturdy, and also to have a shape suitable for minimizing air resistance during high-speed flight. For example, when a rocket flies at high speed in the atmosphere, it is subjected to a great deal of air pressure. If the outer shell wrinkles, it can also lead to its own rupture, or damage or malfunction of the automatic control system, and also destroy the requirements for minimum resistance proposed by aerodynamics. This has become a reality only on the basis of the latest achievements in mechanical engineering by design engineers. Obviously, it is not good if it is too heavy, and it is not good if it is not strong and sturdy enough. For example, the problem of vibration of the shell, if not well resolved in the design, may cause the shell to rupture due to vibration, or damage the automatic controller, such as the horizon instrument and vertical instrument, inside the shell. Also, the longitudinal vibration of the shell may also make the automatic control system and the operating system unable to control, causing the rocket as a whole to deviate from the flight route specified in the flight plan. The length of the rocket of the first artificial satellite is about forty to fifty meters, and the length of the rocket of the second artificial satellite will be even greater. If the longitudinal axis of such a huge object deviates from the flight path by a small angle, then a small deviation will lead to a huge error.
    Manufacturing a very large rocket also requires solving many engineering and technical problems. For example, if the design, manufacture, or installation of the engine is not done well enough, and the central axis of the engine's tail nozzle cannot be closely aligned with the rocket's longitudinal axis, or the pressure center line of the jet is not on the rocket's longitudinal axis, it will cause the rocket's control system to malfunction, making it impossible for the rocket as a whole to advance according to the prescribed plan. The engineers who design the automatic control system also need to cooperate well with the engineers who design the operating system. For example, when the rocket as a whole is disturbed by the outside world and deviates from the prescribed route, the automatic control system receives a signal and starts to act, and finally the operating system is corrected to pull the rocket as a whole back to the prescribed route. However, no matter how good the sensitivity of the automatic control system is, it always takes a certain amount of time for the operating system to act. Moreover, after takeoff, the area of ​​the gas rudder gradually becomes smaller due to the flame ejected by the engine, and at the same time, when correcting the longitudinal rotation of the rocket, it itself will generate an inertia torque related to the speed. The existence of these factors makes the correction work very complicated. If the rocket as a whole has a tilt angle to the left, it must be automatically corrected to the right by the control system and the operating system. If the correction is not enough, the rocket as a whole cannot return to its original flight path. If the correction is too much, the rocket as a whole will deviate from one side to the other. This correction will inevitably cause the rocket as a whole to advance along a wave-shaped road, which is of course not good. Judging from these situations, not only do rocket materials and various important parts require the latest achievements in various sciences to solve, but even with these, the design, manufacture, assembly, and launch of artificial satellites and rockets as a whole require a high degree of scientific and technological knowledge to succeed. Therefore, the successful launch of the first and second artificial Earth satellites by the Soviet Union is not only the result of high scientific and technological achievements, but also the collective creation of scientists and engineers working together. In order to achieve their despicable and dirty ulterior motives, American officers and politicians actually said that "the Soviet Union's launch of artificial satellites is just throwing a piece of iron into the air," which is simply nonsense and shameless.
    Artificial Earth satellites are a further development of all previous aircraft, including airplanes, rockets, and missiles. Its future is as a spacecraft, the latest tool for space travel. Aviation scientists all over the world are pursuing the design of things that have the maximum effective load, the lightest, strongest, and sturdiest structure, and fly the farthest and fastest, day and night. But this requires solving a series of scientific problems, especially understanding the situation at high altitudes. Such as high-altitude magnetic fields, the nature of cosmic rays, the composition, pressure, temperature, and humidity of the atmosphere, the direction of air currents and the state of meteor dust, as well as the blood circulation, blood pressure changes, the working conditions of the respiratory organs and digestive system after the human body is weightless, are all indispensable knowledge in the design of high-altitude aircraft. The successful launch of artificial Earth satellites has made the work of aviation scientists a big step forward. With artificial satellites carrying many instruments, we can enrich our knowledge of high altitudes, improve our aviation science theory, and create favorable conditions for the further development of space flight. Without artificial satellites, the acquisition of this knowledge is very difficult, or even impossible. After obtaining the necessary information about the sky through artificial Earth satellites, scientists can also design artificial satellites to be larger, allowing them to fly higher and faster. It can not only carry radio transmitters, as well as other instruments and experimental animals, but also establish airborne scientific experiment stations and refueling stations far from the earth in the future, transporting people and materials to where they are needed, so as to uncover all the secrets of the universe. Therefore, the successful launch of the second artificial Earth satellite is also a practical step for mankind to enter the road of interstellar flight. All scientific workers who love world peace and pursue human happiness express their warm congratulations and gratitude for this great achievement of the Soviet Union!
    The successful launch of the two artificial Earth satellites by the Soviet Union is an epoch-making contribution. Human activities will no longer be limited to the Earth's range, but are entering the high altitude of the universe. The Soviet Union's third artificial satellite may be launched to the moon! The name of mankind will change from the meaning of earthly animals to the meaning of cosmic animals. In addition to world history, there will also be cosmic history. We want to make friends with "humans" on other planets, we will transport Michurin's apples to Mars, and transport the "apples" there to Earth. The beautiful ideal stories of "Cowherd meeting Weaver Girl" and "Chang'e flying to the moon" will also become a reality. The prospects for human life will be wonderful and infinite. Let us cheer for the red and big flower opened by Soviet science and technology!

    苏联根据国际地球物理年大气层科学研究以及宇宙空间物理过程和生活条件研究计划，在11月3日成功地发射了第二颗人造地球卫星。这颗卫星的发射是苏联第一颗人造地球卫星发射的继续，也是第一颗人造地球卫星的科学成就的进一步发展。毫无疑问，这也是苏联各门科学技术高度成就的结晶。
    人造地球卫星的设计、制造和发射，是一个极其复杂的科学技术问题，也是近代多种重要科学技术成就的总和。它必须在物理、化学、数学、结构力学、空气动力学、飞行器动力学、火箭发动机、自动控制、燃料、材料、工艺、天文、气象等科学高度发展的基础上，才能获得成功。以发送人造地球卫星腾空的火箭的结构来说，火箭的发动机需要能耐高温到三千度以上的轻金属、稀有金属的合金或塑性材料做壳体。由于火箭飞行速度很高，大气层中空气的阻力将使火箭飞行的一部分动能变成热能，火箭外壳同样也需要耐高温的材料制成。这些材料的获得粗略地说是金属物理、冶金、化工等科学高度研究成就的结果，并不是过去已经解决了的，更不是各国科学家在目前都能办得到的。即便是有了这些材料，甚至有了发动机和自动控制系统，问题还没有完全解决。如火箭的外壳需要设计得又轻又坚又强，还要适宜于高速飞行阻力最小的形状，又如火箭在大气层中高速飞行时，它所受的空气压力也是很大的。如果外壳发生皱损，也会导致自身的破裂，或者使自动控制系统发生损坏或失灵，并且也会破坏空气动力学所提出的阻力最小的要求。这是设计工程师在最新力学成就的基础上才变为现实的。如果太重显然不好，不够强不够坚也不行。再如壳体的振动问题，在设计时没有很好地解决，就有可能由于振动使外壳破裂，或者损坏了壳内的自动控制器地平仪、垂直仪等；还有外壳纵长振动也会让自动控制系统和操纵系统无法控制，使火箭整体离开飞行方案中所规定的飞行路线。第一颗人造卫星的火箭的长度约有四十到五十米，第二颗人造卫星的火箭长度会更大。这样一个庞然大物，如果整体的纵轴离开航线一个小角，那么差之毫厘，就要谬之千里。
    制造一个很大的火箭，还有许多工程技术问题需要解决。如发动机的设计、制造或安装等做得不够好，而使发动机的尾部喷管的中轴线不能和火箭的纵轴密合，或喷气的压力中心线不在火箭的纵轴上，都会使火箭的操纵系统失灵，使火箭这个整体不能按照规定的方案前进。设计自动控制系统的工程师还需要和设计操纵系统的工程师很好地合作。如当火箭整体受了外界的扰动离开了规定路线的时候，自动控制系统得到信号以后，就开始动作，最后使操纵系统得到校正，把火箭整体拉回到规定的路线。但是自动控制系统的灵敏度不管怎样好，总是要一定时间才能使操纵系统动作。况且燃气舵在起飞后，由于发动机喷出的火焰使它的面积烧得逐渐变小，同时在校正火箭纵长转动的时候，它本身又要发生和速度有关的惯性力距，这些因素的存在都使校正工作变得很复杂。如果火箭整体向左发生一个倾角，它必然要由控制系统和操纵系统自动地向右校正。如果校正得不够，火箭整体就不能恢复到原来的航线上。如果校正过多，火箭整体就要从一边偏转到另一边。这样校正的结果势必使火箭整体沿着波形的道路前进，这当然不好。由这些情况来看，不仅火箭材料和各种重要部件需要各门科学的最新成就才能够解决，即便有了这些，对于人造卫星和火箭整体的设计、制造、装配和发射，还需要高度的科学技术知识才能成功。因此苏联第一颗和第二颗人造地球卫星能够成功地发射出去，不但是科学技术高度成就的结晶，也是科学家和工程师们分工合作的集体创造。美国的军官和政客们为了达到他们卑鄙龌龊不可告人的目的，竟说“苏联发射人造卫星不过是把一块铁抛到空中而已”，这简直是胡说八道，恬不知耻。
    人造地球卫星是以前一切飞行器的进一步发展，包括飞机、火箭和导弹。它的前途就是作为宇宙航行最新工具的飞船，世界上所有飞行器的航空科学工作者，日日夜夜都在追求着能够设计出有效载荷最大，结构最轻、最坚、最强，飞的最远、最快的东西来。但这需要解决科学上的一系列问题，特别是对于高空情况的了解。如高空磁场，宇宙线的性质，大气的成分、压力、温度、湿度，气流的方向和陨石尘的状况，以及人体失重后的血液循环、血压变化、呼吸器官和消化系统的工作情形等，都是在高空飞行器设计中所不可缺少的知识。人造地球卫星的发射成功，使航空科学工作者的工作又跃进了一大步。有了携带很多仪器的人造卫星，就可以丰富我们关于高空的知识，提高我们航空科学的理论，为宇宙飞行的进一步发展创造了有利的条件。没有人造卫星，这些知识的获得是很困难的，甚至是不可能的。通过人造地球卫星获得了关于天空中所必需知道的资料以后，科学家们还可以在这个基础上，把人造卫星设计得更大，使它飞行得更高、更快。它不仅能够携带无线电发报机，以及其他的仪器和试验动物，而且将来在离地球遥远的地方，能够建立起空中科学实验站和加油站，把人和物资运输到所需要的地方，借以揭开宇宙间的一切秘密。因此，发射第二颗人造地球卫星的成功，也是人类跨入星际飞行道路上的一个实际步骤。凡是热爱世界和平、追求人类幸福的科学工作者，对于苏联这一伟大成就，表示热烈的祝贺和感谢！
    苏联两颗人造地球卫星的发射成功，是一个划时代的贡献。人类的活动将不再是仅仅限于地球范围内，而是正在进入宇宙高空。苏联第三颗人造卫星就有可能发射到月球上去！人类这个名称，将由地球动物的含义变成宇宙动物的含义了。世界历史之外还将有宇宙历史，我们要和其他星球上的“人类”交朋友，我们把米丘林的苹果运到火星上去；把那里的“苹果”运到地球上来。“牛郎会织女”、“嫦娥奔月”这些人间美丽的理想故事也将变成现实。人类生活的远景将美妙无穷。让我们为苏联科学技术开的这朵又红又大的花而欢呼吧！
