    Kunming, 10th (report from our newspaper) - After receiving the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Outline, Yuxi, Yunnan, has re-planned its grain production increase targets and is taking active measures. Liu Zijun, the county party secretary, said that as a result of their implementation of the Agricultural Outline (draft), the average yield per mu this year has reached 700 jin, and in the plains area, it has reached 800 to 1,000 jin. As a result of their re-planning, by the end of the second Five-Year Plan, grain crops will increase from the originally planned 800 jin to 1,100 jin. Liu Zijun said, "To achieve this goal, we are firmly focusing on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation." Originally, it was decided to build four medium-sized reservoirs, namely, the Xi River, Phoenix Dam, Longmu Qing River, and Guan Qing River, and more than forty small reservoirs. However, some comrades were afraid of delaying production, saying that there was not enough labor, insufficient financial resources, and so on. During the study of the revised draft of the Agricultural Outline, these right-leaning ideas were powerfully criticized. After analyzing certain favorable conditions, everyone was full of confidence and decided to invest the money that could be taken out and the money that could be saved in water conservancy construction. Now, about 10,000 people are already working on the construction sites of the four medium-sized reservoirs. The work of water conservancy construction is directly controlled by two county party secretaries, and there is also a county party committee member responsible for each medium-sized water conservancy project. After the reservoirs are completed, the "guaranteed irrigation farmland" can be increased from the current 60,000 mu to 110,000 mu by next year. According to the revised plan, several larger reservoirs will continue to be built next year and the year after, and by 1959, 200,000 mu of Yuxi County's 220,000 mu of land will be irrigated. While building water conservancy, hydropower generation will also be developed accordingly. After these planned reservoirs are completed, they will provide sufficient electricity to the plains and most mountainous areas.

    决心五年内实现“千斤县”
    玉溪县根据纲要精神修订粮食增产规划
    本报昆明10日电　云南玉溪在接到农业发展纲要修正草案后，重新规划粮食增产指标，并积极行动起来。县委书记刘子钧说，他们执行农业纲要（草案）的结果，今年平均每亩产量已达七百斤，平坝区已达到八百斤到一千斤。他们重新规划的结果，到第二个五年计划结束，粮食作物将由原来规划的八百斤增加到一千一百斤。刘子钧说，为达到这个目的，我们狠狠地抓住水利建设和积肥。原先决定修西河、凤凰坝、龙目清河、关清河四个中型水库和四十多个小型水库，但有些同志怕耽误生产，说劳力不够，财力不足等等。在研究农业纲要修正草案时，有力地批判了这些右倾思想。分析了某些有利情况后，大家信心十足，决定把能拿出来的钱，能节约出来的钱投资到水利建设上去。现在约有一万多人已经在四个中型水库工地上施工。兴修水利的工作，由两个县委书记直接掌握，在每个中型水利工程上也都有一个县委委员负责。水库建成后，到明年“保水田”即可由现在的六万亩增加到十一万亩。根据修订的规划，明年和后年，还将继续修建几个较大的水库，到1959年，玉溪县的二十二万亩土地，将有二十万亩得到灌溉。在兴建水利中，也要相应地发展水力发电。这些规划的水库建成后，可使平坝区和大部山区都有较充足的电力。
