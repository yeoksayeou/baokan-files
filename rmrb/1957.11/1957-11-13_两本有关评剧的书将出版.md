Two Books on Pingju Opera to be Published

    Mr. Cheng Zhaocai was one of the founders of Pingju Opera in China. He was an outstanding peasant playwright and dramatic art educator. His plays are still performed regularly in various places as repertoire pieces. The China Pingju Opera House has selected "Yang Sanjie Sues," "Du Shiniang," "Wang Shaoan Catches the Boat," "Filial Piety Moves Heaven," "Liu Cheng Kills His Son-in-Law," and "Loving Daughter, Disliking Daughter-in-Law" and other plays from Mr. Cheng's hundreds of scripts and compiled them into "Selected Pingju Operas of Cheng Zhaocai." The selection is approximately 250,000 words long, with a preface introducing the author's life, artistic life, and creation in a more comprehensive manner. This book will be published by the China Drama Publishing House soon.
    The Popular Literature and Art Publishing House will also publish a "Brief History of Chinese Pingju Opera." The book is divided into three volumes, narrating the development and evolution of Pingju Opera from 1900 to 1949. The book also includes more than seventy valuable photographs. (Bin)
