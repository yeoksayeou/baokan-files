To fundamentally control the flood disasters in the lower reaches of the Huai and Yi Rivers and to ensure the large-scale increase in production in the Northern Jiangsu area, the three major water conservancy hub projects – the Erhe Sluice, the Zhumatou Sluice, and the Suqian Sluice Dam excavation project – have recently commenced construction in the Huaiyin Special Administrative Region of Jiangsu Province. This is one of the key water control projects during the Second Five-Year Plan period and a powerful measure by the state to support the Xuzhou-Huaiyin region of Jiangsu Province in changing its impoverished face.

The Northern Jiangsu area of Jiangsu Province is located in the lower reaches of the Huai, Yi, Shu, and Si Rivers, bearing the burden of draining large amounts of floodwater. Over the past eight years, the state has invested more than 370 million yuan in Jiangsu's Huai River management projects, building the nationally renowned Sanhe Sluice, excavating the Xinyi River and the Irrigation Main Canal, widening and reinforcing the Liyun River and the Huai River waterway into the Yangtze River, and constructing other series of water conservancy projects.

In 1956, the Third Congress of the Chinese Communist Party of Jiangsu Province put forward the suggestion of fundamentally controlling the flood disasters in the Xuzhou-Huai region. Afterwards, with the support of the central government, relevant departments in Jiangsu, after two years of repeated exploration, research, and comparison, finally determined the plan of "diverting Huai water northward, dividing Huai into Yi" and "large-scale control of Luoma Lake." These three major water conservancy projects belong to the first phase of the project of diverting Huai water northward, dividing Huai into Yi, and large-scale control of Luoma Lake, respectively. The so-called "diverting Huai water northward, dividing Huai into Yi" means starting from the Erhe Sluice, which is second only to the Sanhe Sluice in scale, near Hongze Lake, and opening up a Huai-Shu New River about one kilometer wide and 190 kilometers long through Huaiyin and Shuyang all the way to the northeastern corner of Jiangsu, Lianyungang City, in order to divert the water of the Huai River to irrigate the land north of the abandoned Yellow River and reduce the pressure of extraordinary floods in the Lixiahe area.

The large-scale control project of Luoma Lake begins with the construction of the Suqian Sluice Dam project, coupled with the future construction of projects such as the reinforcement of the Xinyi River embankment, to further improve the flood storage and discharge capacity of Luoma Lake and the Xinyi River, ensure that the north and south banks of the Yi River are not threatened by floods, and provide irrigation conditions for the areas along the lake and river.

In the plan of diverting Huai water northward, the Yanhe Irrigation Area starts from Yangzhuang in Huaiyin County, using the original Yanhe and reorganizing it to send water northward. A control sluice will be built near Zhumatou, five kilometers north of Lianshui City, to raise the water level above Zhumatou of the Yanhe. After the completion of these three projects, they will be able to resist extraordinarily large floods that occur once every three to five hundred years in the Huai River and Yi River, completely eliminate the flood threat to 50 million mu of farmland in the Xuzhou-Huai and Lixiahe areas, and increase the irrigation area by more than 14 million mu, turning ten counties and cities such as Shuyang and Lianshui into new rice areas in Jiangsu Province. At the same time, it can also generate a large amount of electricity to develop agriculture and local industry, develop shipping and irrigation. (Attached picture)

    进一步改变多灾贫困面貌
    苏北三大水利工程开工
    本报讯　为根治淮河、沂河下游的洪水灾害，保证苏北地区大量增产的三大水利枢纽工程——二河闸、朱码头闸和宿迁闸坝挖制工程，最近先后在江苏省淮阴专区动工兴建。这是国家第二个五年建设计划期间治水的重点工程之一，也是国家支持江苏省徐（州）（淮）阴地区改变贫困面貌的一个有力措施。
    江苏省苏北地区位于淮、沂、沭、泗等河流的下游，承担着排泄大量洪水的负担。八年来，国家在江苏治淮工程中共投资三亿七千多万元，兴建了全国知名的三河闸，开挖了新沂河和灌溉总渠，搪宽加固了里运河和淮河入江水道，还建设了其他一系列的水利工程。
    1956年，中共江苏省第三次代表大会，提出了根治徐淮地区的洪涝灾害的建议，之后，江苏有关部门在中央支持之下，经过二年的反复勘探、研究和比较，最终确定了“淮水北调、分淮入沂”和“骆马湖大控制”的规划。这三大水利工程即分别属于淮水北调，分淮入沂和骆马湖大控制工程的第一期工程。所谓“淮水北调、分淮入沂”，就是从洪泽湖畔兴建规模仅次于三河闸的二河闸开始，经淮阴、沭阳一直到江苏东北角的新海连市，开辟一条约一公里宽、一百九十公里长的淮沭新河，以便引淮河的水去灌溉废黄河以北的土地，并减轻里下河地区特大洪水的压力。
    骆马湖大控制工程，是从兴建宿迁闸坝工程开始，配合今后施工的新沂河堤加固等工程，进一步提高骆马湖、新沂河的蓄洪泄洪能力，保证沂河南北两岸不受洪水威胁，并为沿湖沿河地区提供灌溉条件。
    淮水北调规划中，盐河灌区自淮阴县杨庄起，利用原有盐河，加以整理，向北送水，在涟水城北五公里的朱码头附近建设节制闸，抬高盐河朱码头以上的水位。这三项工程完工后，就可抗御淮河和沂河三百年到五百年一遇的特大洪水，彻底消除徐淮及里下河地区五千万亩农田的洪涝威胁，并可增加灌溉面积一千四百多万亩，使沭阳、涟水等十个县市，变成江苏省的新水稻区，同时还可发出大量的电力以发展农业和地方工业，发展航运和灌溉事业。（附图片）
