Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Telegram Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry recently organized all cadres of the Department to speak out freely on the issue of how local industry can better serve agriculture, and to offer criticisms and suggestions for improvement regarding shortcomings and errors in this area.

Many cadres criticized during the voicing of opinions that the Sichuan provincial local industrial departments have promoted too few new-style farm tools in recent years, and have not paid enough attention to the work of improving old-style farm tools and repairing them. Now, farmers are generally reflecting that farm tools are not suitable, and there is nowhere to repair farm tools when they are broken. Some people cited the example that the Sichuan double-wheel double-plow is completely manufactured according to Beijing's drawings, each weighing more than 90 kilograms, which is very bulky and difficult to adapt to the complex terrain of Sichuan. Farmers are unwilling to use them, and the relevant departments do not promptly study and improve them. Now, 70,000 plows are overstocked, causing great waste. Many cadres believe that Sichuan's local industry urgently needs to solve the problem of farm tool repair and replacement for the countryside, and improve and supply some new-style farm tools suitable for local agricultural production. Therefore, they suggested that the Department of Industry immediately organize relevant factories and mines to form working groups, go deep into the countryside to conduct field tests of new-style farm tools, summarize experience, and then gradually modify and promote them; they also suggested setting up repair stations in larger agricultural cooperatives, and organizing farm tool repair industries to take turns going to the countryside.

Many cadres mentioned in their free airing of opinions that Sichuan has very abundant fertilizer resources, including limestone for making nitrogen fertilizer, edible salt for making ammonium chloride, pyrite for making ammonium sulfate, as well as factory slag, etc. However, Sichuan's local industrial departments have not fully utilized these resources in the past, and have only developed one type of phosphate rock powder, which obviously cannot guarantee the needs of complex soil types and the fertilization of various crops. Many people suggested that the future development of Sichuan's local fertilizer industry should implement the principle of combining large, medium, and small enterprises. Utilizing local materials to produce a variety of fertilizers, closely cooperating with agricultural departments, and strengthening the trial production and promotion of new products.

Many cadres believe that helping rural areas develop small-scale hydropower is an important task for Sichuan's local industry, and suggest setting up management agencies for small-scale hydropower stations at the provincial and special district levels to specifically guide this work.

Many cadres also raised opinions on rural small coal mines, special district and county-owned small factories and mines, and other issues.

The person in charge of the Department of Industry stated that they will immediately study these suggestions, and some will be adopted when arranging production plans for this winter and next year.

    地方工业怎样更好地为农业服务？
    四川省工业厅发动干部大鸣大放
    据新华社成都电　四川省工业厅最近就地方工业如何为农业服务的问题，组织工业厅全体干部鸣放，对这方面的缺点和错误提出批评和改进的意见。
    许多干部在鸣放中批评四川省地方工业部门这几年推广的新式农具太少，对改良旧式农具和修配农具的工作注意不够。现在，农民普遍反映农具不合用，农具坏了没处修。有人举例说，四川的双轮双铧犁完全是按照北京的图样制造的，每辆重九十多公斤，非常笨重，很难适应四川复杂的地形。农民不愿使用，有关部门也不及时研究改进。现在积压了七万辆，造成很大浪费。许多干部认为，四川省地方工业急需为农村解决农具修配的问题，改进和供应一些适于本地区农业生产的新式农具。因此，他们建议工业厅立即组织有关厂矿成立工作组，深入农村实地进行新式农具的试验，总结经验，再逐步加以修改推广；还建议在较大的农业社里设修理站，并组织农具修理行业轮流下乡。
    许多干部在鸣放中都谈到，四川肥料资源非常丰富，有制氮肥的石灰石，制氯化铵的食盐，制硫酸錏的硫铁矿，以及工厂的炉渣等等，但是，四川省地方工业部门过去没有充分利用这些资源，只搞了一种磷矿粉，这显然不能保证土壤种类复杂和多种农作物施肥的需要。许多人提出建议，今后四川地方肥料工业的发展，应该贯彻大、中、小企业相结合的原则。就地取材，生产多种肥料，同农业部门密切配合，加强新产品的试制和推广工作。
    不少干部认为，帮助农村发展小型水电是四川省地方工业的一项重要任务，建议在省和专区里设立小型水电站的管理机构，具体指导这一工作。
    许多干部还就农村小煤窑，专区、县属小厂矿等问题，提出意见。
    工业厅负责人表示将立即研究这些建议，有的将在安排今冬和明年的生产计划时加以采纳。
