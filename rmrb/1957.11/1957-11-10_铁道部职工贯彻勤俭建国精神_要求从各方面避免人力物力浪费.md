Xinhua News Agency, 9th. After entering the third stage of rectification in mid-October, the Ministry of Railways has posted more than 14,000 big-character posters, and a full-scale upsurge of airing views centered on rectification has taken shape. Through big-character posters and airing views forums, the broad masses of employees have put forward more than 30,000 suggestions to the leadership.

Many big-character posters, proceeding from the spirit of diligent and thrifty nation-building and diligent and thrifty enterprise management, put forward criticisms and suggestions on basic construction and production work, systems and institutions, and leadership style.

Big-character posters from the Basic Construction Bureau under the Ministry criticized that, in the total investment of new railway construction in China, only more than 60% of the funds are used for productive construction, and more than 30% of the funds are used for management fees, temporary construction fees, relocation fees, and other non-productive expenses. Those who posted the big-character posters unanimously demanded to streamline institutions and reduce management personnel, and improve the management of basic construction, in order to reduce the proportion of non-productive expenses in the entire railway construction. Engineer Pan Mingyuan and Wu Zhiyan, head of the Finance Section, co-signed a big-character poster, exposing that at the end of 1956, due to poor planning by the leaders of the Ministry of Railways, a unit of the Railway Corps was transferred from Fujian to Urumqi, and after two months, the unit was transferred to Baotou, wasting more than 2 million yuan in dispatch fees alone. Tian Hongbin and others wrote big-character posters, exposing that there are more than 20,000 tons of scattered old steel beams in railway systems across the country, with a value of more than 160 million yuan. They suggested that these scattered materials should be fully utilized in future railway bridge construction. The big-character posters also put forward specific methods on how to effectively utilize these materials. Many big-character posters from the Freight Bureau, Train Operations Bureau, and Passenger Transport Bureau also criticized the shortcomings of affecting the transportation of national construction materials and affecting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas due to poor transportation planning. The big-character posters put forward many opinions on further strengthening railway transportation planning and improving vehicle dispatch work.

In terms of the system and institutions of the organs, many employees criticized the existing shortcomings of the Ministry of Railways in having excessively detailed and rigid division of labor in the institutions, and demanded to merge and reduce institutions with a revolutionary spirit, and streamline and decentralize personnel. Many cadres also expressed their determination to go to the grassroots and rural areas to undergo training through big-character posters and airing views forums. Big-character posters from many units pointed out that the work of the Basic Construction Bureau, the Engineering General Bureau, the Design General Bureau, and the Technical Appraisal Committee of the Ministry of Railways are closely related and inseparable. In the past, when they were managed separately, there were often phenomena of mutual obstruction and buck-passing. Therefore, many people advocated to reasonably adjust these four institutions according to the tasks. In terms of railway transportation work, many people pointed out that the four bureaus are currently in charge of freight, transportation, passenger transportation, vehicle dispatch, and external liaison and development of cargo sources, and many contradictions often occur due to decentralized management. Because these tasks must be subject to unified transportation plans, they suggested that these four bureaus can also be adjusted to strengthen unified leadership. After the Design General Bureau launched extensive and in-depth airing of views and debates on big-character posters and airing views forums, the rectification leading group of the bureau has adopted the reasonable opinions of the masses and sorted out a preliminary plan to streamline the institutions from the original 242 personnel of the bureau to 94. At the same time, this plan was handed over to the masses for further in-depth discussion. Now, more than 150 people in this bureau have expressed their determination to obey the organization's arrangements and are willing to go to grassroots units and rural areas for training.

In the big-character posters and airing views forums of various units, in addition to some cadres putting forward criticisms and suggestions for correction on the unreasonable phenomena in the past work of living welfare and wage assessment, most cadres also demanded to abolish special treatment based on the spirit of diligent and thrifty nation-building and diligent and thrifty enterprise management. Someone in the Basic Construction Bureau once put forward in a big-character poster that in addition to normal wages, the units under the Ministry of Railways also had 15 types of wage subsidy systems in the past, and this subsidy system has increased year by year, some of which are not available in other central industrial departments. Therefore, they demanded to abolish and reasonably adjust these systems. According to statistics, in 1957, the state spent 70 million yuan more than in 1956 due to the increase in regional subsidies and mobility subsidies alone by the Ministry of Railways. Some big-character posters also demanded that service institutions such as the railway department's daily consumer goods supply stations be handed over to the local government for unified management, in order to strengthen leadership, reduce institutions and personnel, and give full play to the potential of these departments.

### 铁道部职工贯彻勤俭建国精神  要求从各方面避免人力物力浪费

    铁道部职工贯彻勤俭建国精神
    要求从各方面避免人力物力浪费
    新华社9日讯  铁道部从上月中旬转入整风第三阶段后已贴出大字报一万四千多张，以整改为中心的鸣放热潮全面形成。广大职工通过大字报和鸣放座谈会给领导上提出了三万多条意见。
    很多大字报从勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的精神出发，对基本建设和生产工作、体制和机构、领导作风等方面提出了批评和建议。
    这个部所属的基本建设局的大字报上，批评了目前我国新建铁路建设的总投资中，只有60％多的资金是用于生产性的建设，30％多的资金是用于管理费、临时建筑费、迁移费等非生产性的开支。贴大字报的人一致要求紧缩机构和减少管理人员、改善基本建设的管理工作，以降低整个铁路建设非生产性开支的比例。工程师潘铭元和财务科科长吴志琰共同署名写的一张大字报，揭发了1956年底铁道部领导上因为计划不周，曾从福建调了铁道兵团的一个部队到乌鲁木齐，过了两个月又把这个部队调到包头，仅浪费的调遣费就有二百多万元。工程师田鸿宾等人写的大字报，揭发全国各地铁路系统零星散置的旧钢梁有二万多吨，价值达一亿六千多万元，他们建议在今后的铁路桥梁建设中要充分利用这些散置的材料，大字报并且提出如何有效利用的具体办法。货运局、车务局和客运局等单位的许多大字报，也曾批评了由于运输计划不周因而影响国家建设物资的运输，以及影响城乡物资交流的缺点，大字报提出了许多进一步加强铁路运输计划和改善车辆调度工作的意见。
    在机关的体制与机构方面，许多职工批评目前铁道部存在的机构分工过细过死的缺点，要求以革命精神合并和裁减机构，紧缩与下放人员。不少干部并通过大字报和鸣放座谈会，表示了自己愿意到基层和下农村去锻炼的决心。有许多单位的大字报提出，铁道部的基本建设局、工程总局、设计总局和技术鉴定委员会四个单位的工作有着密切不可分的联系，过去分别管理时常常发生互相掣肘的扯皮现象，因而不少人主张按照任务合理调整这四个机构。在铁路运输工作方面，不少人提出目前四个局分管货物、运输、旅客运输、车辆调度和对外联系与开辟货源的工作，和经常由于分散管理而发生许多矛盾，由于这些工作必须服从统一的运输计划，因此他们建议这四个局也可以调整，以加强统一领导。设计总局在大字报和鸣放座谈会上展开广泛深入的大鸣大放大辩论之后，这个局的整风领导小组已采纳群众合理的意见，整理出由全局原有人员二百四十二人减到九十四人的初步紧缩机构的方案，同时又把这个方案再交给群众进一步深入讨论。现在，这个局已有一百五十多人表示决心服从组织分配，愿意到基层单位和农村中去锻炼。
    在各单位的大字报和鸣放座谈会上，除了有些干部对过去的生活福利、工资评定等工作中的不合理现象提出批评和改正建议外，多数干部也根据勤俭建国和勤俭办企业的精神，要求取消特殊化的待遇。基本建设局曾有人在大字报上提出铁道部所属各单位除正常工资外，过去还规定有十五种工资津贴制度，并且这种津贴制度逐年增加，其中有些是中央其他工业部门所没有的。因此，他们要求取消和合理调整这些制度。据统计，1957年铁道部仅由于地区津贴和流动津贴两项支出的增加，国家就比1956年多花了七千万元。有的大字报上还要求将铁路部门的日用消费品供应站等服务性机构交给地方上统一管理，以加强领导，减缩机构和人员，充分发挥这些部门的潜力。
