Xinhua News Agency, 28th: "To build the current economically and culturally backward mountain areas into socialist mountain areas that are economically and culturally advanced, prosperous, and happy," is the overall goal of mountain area production and construction proposed by Deng Zihui, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in his concluding report at the Mountain Area Production Symposium.

    The Great Significance of Developing Mountain Area Production

Deng Zihui's report comprehensively discussed various issues related to mountain area production and construction.

In the first part of his report, "The Important Position of Mountain Area Production," he stated that mountain area production occupies a strategic position in China's national economic construction because: mountain areas are vast; resources are abundant; potential is infinite; the future is unlimited; and it is extremely important to the nation's economic construction.

China's mountain area is very large, accounting for about 80% of the total land area of the mainland. In addition to ethnic minority regions such as Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia, according to statistics from twenty-one provinces, there are 1,237 counties in mountain and semi-mountain areas, accounting for more than half of the total number of counties in these provinces; mountain areas account for 62.4% of the land area, with over 560 million mu of cultivated land, accounting for 35.8% of the total cultivated land area, and grain output accounts for about one-third. In the vast mountain areas of these provinces, there are also various abundant resources, including more than one billion mu of forests (accounting for 14% of the land area), with a timber reserve of 4.4 billion cubic meters, as well as a large number of special economic forests such as tung oil trees, tea oil trees, Chinese tallow trees, tea trees, and various fresh and dried fruit trees, and even more uncultivated barren mountains and wastelands and mineral deposits waiting to be developed and utilized. Therefore, marching into the mountains, fully developing and utilizing various resources in mountain areas, and comprehensively developing mountain area production have become one of the important directions for developing agricultural production in China.

He pointed out that the construction of mountain areas is closely related to the plains. If mountain areas are not well managed and soil erosion is serious, it will affect agricultural production in the plains downstream of various rivers; in this way, the goals set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) cannot be achieved. Agriculture is an extremely important condition for developing industry, and if agricultural development lags behind, socialist industrialization will also be affected. If mountain area production is not comprehensively developed, agriculture will be greatly affected, and it will also affect exports, handicrafts, and so on. In short, the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of 600 million people are closely related to mountain areas. It is required that the whole country support the mountain areas, and the mountain areas can support the whole country; mountain areas cannot be viewed in isolation.

Many areas in the mountains are old revolutionary base areas, and the people of the old base areas have made tremendous contributions to China's revolutionary cause. Therefore, Deng Zihui pointed out that comprehensively developing mountain area production not only has huge economic significance but also has significant political significance.

    Goals and Guidelines for Mountain Area Construction

The second part of Deng Zihui's report is "The Direction of Future Development of Mountain Area Production." He first pointed out the four characteristics of mountain area production:

(1) Mountain area production is diverse. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and mining are all involved, with more variety than in the plains. (2) Many mountain area productions are long-term. For example, various trees take ten or twenty years to yield benefits. Therefore, the task of agricultural infrastructure construction in mountain areas is very large. (3) Mountain area production has a large commodity nature. Except for grain, most other products need to be sold. (4) Mountain area production has great regional and seasonal characteristics.

Secondly, he analyzed the favorable conditions and difficult factors of mountain area production. The favorable conditions are: China has a large population, and the farmers are diligent and brave. The people of mountain areas have rich experience in mountain area production and construction; mountain areas are rich in resources, and there are many ways to develop production, allowing for diversified operations; natural conditions are good; many mountain areas are old revolutionary base areas, and the masses have a high level of political awareness; and mountain areas have already realized cooperativization, which is the most favorable condition. The difficulties are: the population distribution in mountain areas is uneven, and the production enthusiasm of some mountain area farmers is not very stable, and they want to move down the mountains; they have suffered from reactionary rule and war damage for many years, with severe wounds; due to the destruction of forests, soil erosion is serious; and inconvenient transportation seriously affects the material exchange between mountain areas and plains and urban and rural areas.

Based on the above situation, Deng Zihui said that our overall goal for building mountain areas is: to build the current economically and culturally backward mountain areas into socialist mountain areas that are economically and culturally advanced, prosperous, and happy. In order to achieve this goal, the guidelines for mountain area production and construction are: "On the basis of doing a good job in water and soil conservation and striving for self-sufficiency and surplus in grain and oil, we must plan and adapt to local conditions to comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and various economies such as local specialties and minerals."

He said that this guideline can also be divided into six points: The first is to develop a diversified economy in mountain areas, not to be singular. The second is to adapt to local conditions, refer to history, not to be generalized, and not to sever history. The third is to strive for self-sufficiency and surplus in grain and oil, or to achieve self-sufficiency within a certain period. The fourth is to vigorously plant trees and afforest, because forests are necessary to maintain water and soil, and forests are necessary for local specialties. Forest is a long-term production. We must not only manage forests, but also combine the development of forests with annual crops, and use short-term production to support long-term production; we must not only plant timber forests, but also plant some special economic forests and fuelwood forests, combining timber forests with special economic forests. The fifth is to do a good job in water and soil conservation. Without water and soil conservation, there is no agriculture and forestry; water and soil conservation is needed for mountain area production, and even more so for plain production. The sixth is to make a comprehensive plan to make the best use of land, materials, and talents.

    Eight Major Tasks

In the third part of his report, Deng Zihui clearly put forward eight major tasks for developing mountain area production:

First, we must give full play to the potential of cultivated land in mountain areas and develop agricultural production on the basis of increasing unit yield. First of all, we must increase grain production in mountain areas. Except for high-altitude cold mountain areas, mountain areas with very short frost-free periods, and rocky mountains, generally, we must achieve the targets of 400, 500, and 800 jin stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). Secondly, we must correspondingly develop economic crops such as oil crops, hemp, sugar crops, and sericulture to reduce the burden on the plains.

Second, vigorously carry out afforestation, forest cultivation, and forest protection work to develop forestry.

In recent years, a lot of forests have been felled, and afforestation has not been enough. If this continues, it will be difficult to meet the greater needs of future construction, and it will also affect water and soil conservation. Therefore, we must first focus on afforestation. According to statistics from twenty-one provinces, there are currently one billion mu of forests, accounting for 14% of the land area. If we afforest another one billion mu, the forest area will only account for 28% of the land area, which may basically achieve the role of maintaining water and soil and conserving water sources and regulating the climate. (The forest area to control soil erosion must reach about 30%) Everyone agrees: It is very good to afforest 800 million mu in ten years, and we should strive to complete it. After this plan is completed, we will use another ten years to afforest a large area in remote mountain areas, that is, within twenty years, the mountain areas across the country can basically achieve greening.

Large-scale afforestation mainly relies on cooperatives, followed by state-owned afforestation, then joint afforestation by the state and cooperatives, and finally individual scattered afforestation.

Secondly, we must attach importance to the protection of existing forests. In recent years, forest fires have been serious in some areas, resulting in considerable losses. In order to change this situation, both in the north and the south, and whether it is state-owned or collectively-owned forests, fire prevention measures must be implemented, fire brigades must be established, fire-fighting equipment must be purchased, and forest roads must be built to put out mountain fires.

Again, forests must be used rationally. The phenomenon of waste of wood is quite serious now. Only 50% of one million cubic meters of wood is utilized, while the Soviet Union utilizes more than 80%. This situation should be changed. For the logging methods of large state-owned forests, we cannot "shave the head". Appropriate logging methods must be implemented, cutting down large and old trees and leaving young trees to facilitate water and soil conservation and nurturing and renewal. After the forestry department and the forest industry department are merged, the logging unit is the afforestation unit, and the phenomenon of managing logging without afforestation must be overcome. For private forests in the south, the state generally only sets up purchasing stations, and the cooperatives contract to cut and transport them, and a plan must be formulated to combine logging, afforestation, and nurturing and renewal in a planned and step-by-step manner. Regardless of the south and the north, we must change the phenomenon of only logging forests near the mountains and not logging forests in deep and remote mountains.

Third, we must make full use of water and grass resources in mountain areas and vigorously develop animal husbandry. The development of livestock in mountain areas must not only meet local needs but also supply tillage livestock and edible livestock to hilly and plain areas. In order to develop animal husbandry in mountain areas, we must strengthen livestock epidemic prevention and circulation work.

Fourth, we must develop the production of local specialties according to local conditions to meet the needs of industry and export. The production of local specialties occupies an important position in China's national economy. More than 50% of China's export commodities are produced in mountain areas. In order to develop the production of local specialties, including medicinal materials and furs, all localities should consult with commercial, foreign trade, and other departments to sign contracts.

Fifth, we must do a good job in water and soil conservation in mountain areas. In order to do this work well, according to the principles of overall planning, comprehensive management, and centralized management, we must plan to manage areas with serious soil erosion in batches, stages, ditches, and pieces, and basically control controllable soil erosion within ten years. He said that an important method of controlling soil erosion is to build terraces, afforest, and plant grass, and take comprehensive measures.

Mountain areas must also develop water conservancy, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. Everything is inseparable from water. We must have the spirit of Wushan County, Gansu and Dashan Society of Junan County, Shandong to lead water up the mountain, not afraid of all difficulties, and do a good job in water conservancy construction in mountain areas. Mountain areas generally have a larger slope. With water, we can also engage in small-scale hydropower generation to prepare conditions for rural electrification.

Sixth, we must develop processing industries and handicrafts in mountain areas and develop mineral deposits in mountain areas.

Transportation in mountain areas is inconvenient, and it is more difficult to transport raw materials. If we process them locally, it will be more convenient to transport finished products and semi-finished products. Therefore, the light industry department should study the establishment of medium-sized and small-sized food and other processing plants in mountain areas, and move the processing industry to the mountains. At the same time, we should entrust the cooperatives to process as much as possible.

Handicrafts should also go to the mountains, using local materials to manufacture handicrafts, and repair agricultural tools for farmers.

Mineral deposits in mountain areas, such as coal mines, iron mines, gold mines, and manganese mines, can also be developed by cooperatives, but only small-scale ones are suitable, not large-scale ones. And go through certain approval procedures. Pay attention to protecting resources.

Seventh, vigorously develop transportation in mountain areas, which is a fundamental condition for developing mountain area production. Within ten years, the economic arteries of mountain areas should be built into simple highways, and the remaining places should be built into large roads, improved post roads, and sidewalks. Gradually improve, act according to capacity. First of all, waterways must be utilized, especially in places where timber is produced, the river channels must be repaired to facilitate transportation.

In order to develop transportation in mountain areas, in the future, transportation investment must take care of mountain areas in a certain proportion; we can also adopt the form of public-private joint ventures, with various relevant departments raising funds to help farmers build roads and bridges. Transportation tools in mountain areas should be improved, and relevant departments are required to study them.

Eighth, we must develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings in mountain areas to gradually improve the cultural level of the people in mountain areas and eliminate diseases.

    Ten Measures

The fourth part of Deng Zihui's report is the ten measures that should be taken to complete the above tasks.

He said that first of all, we must do a good job in ideological mobilization, unify understanding, clarify the direction, establish confidence, cheer up, face the mountains, and march into the mountains. He emphasized that we must have the spirit of letting rivers change their course and mountains bow their heads to build mountain areas. Leading cadres must take the lead in going to the mountains. Provinces and counties should hold mountain area representative meetings regularly to listen to the opinions of the people in mountain areas, solve their difficulties, and encourage their confidence.

Doing a good job in the overall plan for developing mountain area production is an important measure. He said that the mountain area economy is comprehensive, so we must plan comprehensively and arrange uniformly. When making plans, we must neither be conservative nor unrealistic. For this reason, we must follow the mass line. First, we must propose targets from top to bottom, and then discuss them from bottom to top through the cooperatives based on the specific situation to formulate a plan; then the townships, counties, and provinces will make realistic, feasible, positive, and prudent plans at each level, and then comprehensively balance them at each level, and finally finalize the plan.

Reversing the outflow of population from mountain areas is a primary way to solve the shortage of labor in mountain areas. He emphasized that we must do a good job in ideological education for the people in mountain areas so that they can settle down to engage in production and construction. In addition, we must mobilize the surplus labor force in urban and rural areas to go to the mountains and develop mountain areas.

In order to develop mountain area production, we must also mobilize a large number of outstanding cadres to go to the mountains. They must eat, live, and work with the farmers, and they must also undertake the tasks of leading production and organizing production. Therefore, the task of the cadres going to the mountains is both arduous and glorious.

Strengthening commercial work in mountain areas is an important link in promoting the development of mountain area production. Deng Zihui said that we must vigorously develop the commercial network in mountain areas; in places where purchasing and marketing points cannot be established, we can entrust agricultural cooperatives to purchase and sell on their behalf; producing and marketing areas can also meet directly in order to reduce circulation links. He emphasized that an important issue in commercial work in mountain areas is the price issue, and some products whose purchase prices are not completely appropriate should be adjusted; there should be reasonable price differences between regions, varieties, and purchasing and selling. If the price is reasonable, the enthusiasm of farmers for production can be improved.

Deng Zihui also pointed out: Strengthening technical support, technology going to the mountains; the state providing necessary economic support to mountain areas; attaching importance to ethnic work and doing a good job in ethnic unity; are all important measures to develop mountain area production. He made detailed discussions on these issues.

The last measure he put forward is that the provincial committees of the Communist Party of China must strengthen unified leadership over various tasks in mountain areas. This is the fundamental guarantee for building mountain areas. Each province should have a secretary or deputy governor in charge of mountain area work.

    Run Cooperatives Well and Consolidate Agricultural Production Cooperatives According to Mountain Area Characteristics

The fifth part of his report is "Running and Consolidating Mountain Area Agricultural Production Cooperatives Well." He said that building mountain areas mainly relies on cooperatives. Mountain areas have their own characteristics, and we cannot run cooperatives according to the same set of methods as in the plains. The scale of cooperatives and the organization of labor should be adapted to local conditions. There are many ways to develop production in mountain areas, and the members of the cooperatives should be given reasonable labor remuneration according to different jobs and technical levels to improve their enthusiasm for production.

After production in mountain areas develops, the income of the cooperatives will be very large. Therefore, while ensuring that the income of the members of the cooperatives increases year by year, we should retain more public accumulation funds. If the income is too much, we can also retain a part of it for storage for famine prevention, which is not counted as public accumulation funds or distributed. In addition, in forest areas, we can also retain forestry funds for the development of forestry.

There are many and complex ways to develop sideline production in mountain areas. Therefore, the division of the scope of sideline production and operation should not adopt the same set of methods as in the plains, and should be adapted to local conditions.

Mountain area production has a large commodity nature, which has some influence on the members of the cooperatives. He emphasized that it is very important to conduct regular ideological education on socialism and collectivism for the members, and we must strengthen political and ideological work to prevent the breeding of spontaneous capitalist ideas.

    建设繁荣幸福的新山区
    邓子恢同志在山区生产座谈会上作总结报告
    新华社28日讯　“把现在经济上文化上落后的山区建设成为社会主义的经济上文化上进步、繁荣、康乐幸福的山区”，这是中共中央农村工作部部长邓子恢在山区生产座谈会上所作的总结报告中提出的山区生产建设的总目标。
    发展山区生产的重大意义
    邓子恢的报告内容，全面地论述了山区生产建设的各项问题。
    他在报告的第一部分“山区生产所处的重要地位”中说，山区生产在我国国民经济建设中占有战略性地位，这是因为：山区面积辽阔；资源丰富；潜力无穷；前途无限；和全国的经济建设关系极为重大。
    我国的山区面积很大，在大陆国土的总面积中有80％左右是山区和半山区。除西藏、新疆、青海、内蒙古等少数民族地区外，据二十一个省统计，山区、半山区的县份有一千二百三十七个，占这些省总县数的一半以上；山区的土地面积占62．4％，耕地有五亿六千多万亩，占耕地总面积的35．8％，粮食产量也占三分之一左右。在这些省的广大山区中，还有各种丰富的资源，其中有森林十亿多亩（占土地面积14％），木材蓄积量达四十四亿立方公尺，另外还有大量的油桐、油茶、乌桕、茶树和各种干鲜果树等特种经济林木，有待开发利用的荒山荒地和矿藏更多。因此，向山区进军，充分开发和利用山区的各项资源，全面发展山区生产，就成为我国发展农业生产的重要方向之一。
    他指出，山区的建设，和平原的关系很大。山区搞不好，水土流失严重，就要影响各河下游平原地区的农业生产；这样，全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的目标就不可能实现。农业是发展工业的极为重要的一个条件，农业的发展如果落后，社会主义工业化也要受到影响。山区生产如果不全面发展，农业将受重大影响，还要影响出口、手工业等等。总之，六亿人民的衣、食、住、行都和山区有着密切的关系。要求全国都来支援山区，山区就能支援全国，不能孤立地来看山区。　山区有许多地区是革命老根据地，老根据地的人民对我国的革命事业有过巨大的贡献。因此，邓子恢指出，全面地发展山区生产，不仅有巨大的经济意义，还有重大的政治意义。
    建设山区的目标和方针
    邓子恢的报告的第二部分是“今后发展山区生产的方向”。他首先指出了山区生产的四个特点：
  （一）山区生产是多样性的。农业、林业、牧业、副业、采矿项项都有，比之平原更多种多样。（二）山区生产有许多是长期性的。例如，各种林木要有十年、二十年才有收益。因此，山区的农业基本建设任务很大。（三）山区生产商品性大，除粮食外，其他各种产品大部都要卖出。（四）山区生产地区性、季节性大。
    其次，他分析了山区生产的有利条件和困难因素。有利条件是：我国人多，农民勤劳勇敢。山区人民有丰富的山区生产建设经验；山区资源丰富，生产门路很多，可搞多种经营；自然条件较好；许多山区是革命老根据地，群众政治觉悟较高；山区已经实现了合作化，这是最有利的条件。困难是：山区人口分布不均，有些山区农民生产情绪还不很稳定，想要下山；多年遭受反动统治和战争破坏，创伤较重；由于林木受到破坏，水土流失严重；交通不便，山区和平原城乡的物资交流受到严重影响。
    根据以上情况，邓子恢说，我们建设山区的总目标是：把现在经济上文化上落后的山区建设成为社会主义的经济上文化上进步、繁荣、康乐幸福的山区。为了达到这个目标，山区生产建设的方针是：“要在做好水土保持、力争粮食、油料等自给有余的基础上，有计划地因地制宜地全面地发展农业、林业、牧业和土特产、矿产等多种经济。”
    他说，这个方针也可分为六条来说：第一条是发展山区的多种经济，不要单一化。第二条是因地制宜，参照历史，不要一般化，不要割断历史。第三条是力争粮食、油料自给有余，或在一定时期达到自给。第四条是必须大力植树造林，有林才能保持水土，有林才有土特产，林木是长期性的生产，不能只营林木，发展林木要和当年生的作物相结合，用短期生产来支援长期生产；不能光造用材林，要造一些特种经济林和薪炭林，用材林和特种经济林相结合。第五条是做好水土保持工作，没有水土保持，便没有农业和林业；水土保持，对山区生产需要，对平原生产更需要。第六条是全面规划，做到地尽其利，物尽其用，人尽其才。
    八大任务
    邓子恢在报告的第三部分中明确地提出了发展山区生产的八大任务：
    第一，要发挥山区耕地的潜在力量，在提高单位产量基础上发展农业生产。首先，要提高山区的粮食产量。除高寒山区、无霜期很短的山区和石山以外，一般地都要达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的指标。其次，要相应地发展油料、麻类、糖料、蚕桑等经济作物，以减轻平原地区的负担。
    第二，大力开展造林、育林、护林工作，发展林业。
    几年来森林砍伐不少，造林还不够多，如果再继续下去，将甚难满足将来建设的更大需要，同时也要影响水土保持。因此，首先要抓紧造林工作。据二十一个省统计，现有森林十亿亩，占土地面积14％，如果再造十亿亩，森林面积才占土地面积的28％，才有可能达到基本上保持水土涵养水源、调节气候的作用。（控制水土流失森林面积要达30％左右）大家意见：要在十年内造林八亿亩，这是很好的，应该努力完成。这个计划完成了，再用十年时间再在边远山区大量造林，即在二十年内，全国山区就可以基本上实现绿化。
    大量的造林主要依靠合作社，其次是国营造林，再次是国家和合作社合营造林，最后是个体的零星造林。
    其次，必须重视对现有森林的保护工作。几年来有些地区山林火灾严重，损失不小。为了改变这种情况，无论北方和南方，无论国有林和社有林，都要实行防火措施，成立防火队，购置防火设备，还要修建森林公路，以便扑灭山火。
    再次，要合理使用森林。现在浪费木材的现象相当严重，砍一百万立方公尺木材只利用50％，而苏联却利用80％以上，应该改变这种情况。对大片国有林的采伐方法，不能“剃光头”，要实行适当的采伐方式，把大树、老树砍掉，留下幼树，以利水土保持和抚育更新。林业部门和森林工业部门合并后，采伐单位就是造林单位，管采不造的现象必须克服。对南方的私有林，国家一般只设采购站，由合作社包砍包运，并要订出规划，有计划有步骤地使采伐、造林和抚育更新相互结合。不管南方和北方，都要改变只采近山林木不采深山、远山林木的现象。
    第三，要充分利用山区水草资源，大力发展畜牧业。山区发展牲畜，除满足当地需要外，还要供应丘陵区和平原地区耕畜和食用牲畜。为了发展山区的畜牧业，要加强牲畜防疫工作和流通工作。
    第四，要因地制宜地发展土特产品的生产，以满足工业和出口的需要。土特产品的生产，在我国国民经济中是占有重要位置的。我国的出口商品中有50％以上是山区生产的。为了发展包括药材、皮毛在内的土特产品的生产，各地应该同商业、对外贸易等部门协商订立合同。
    第五，必须把山区的水土保持工作搞好。为了做好这个工作，要按照全面规划、综合治理、集中治理的原则，对水土流失现象严重的地区要有计划的分期分批分沟分片的加以治理，在十年之内要基本上控制可能控制的水土流失。他说，控制水土流失的一项重要方法就是要修梯田，造林，种草，采取综合性措施。
    山区也要发展水利、农业、林业、牧业、副业，样样离不了水，要有甘肃武山县和山东莒南县大山社引水上山那种不怕一切困难的精神，把山区的水利建设搞好。山区一般坡度较大，有了水还可搞小型的水力发电，为农村电气化准备条件。
    第六，要发展山区的加工工业、手工业，开发山区的矿藏。
    山区交通不便，运出原料比较困难，如果就地加工，运出成品、半成品就方便多了。因此，轻工业部门要研究一下，在山区搞中型和小型的食品等加工厂，把加工工业搬上山去。同时还应该尽可能委托合作社加工。
    手工业也要上山，就地取材制造手工业品，并给农民修理农具。
    山区中的矿藏如煤矿、铁矿、金矿、锰矿等也可由合作社开发，但只宜搞小型的，不宜大搞。并经过一定批准手续。要注意保护资源。
    第七，大力发展山区交通，这是发展山区生产的一个根本条件。十年内要把山区的经济要道修成简易公路，其余的地方要修大车道、改良驿道和人行道。要逐步提高，量力而行。首先要把水道利用起来，特别是出产木材的地方，要修一下河道，以便流送。
    为了发展山区的交通运输，今后，的交通投资要按一定的比例照顾山区；还可采取民办公助的形式，由各有关部门集资帮助农民修路、修桥。山区的运输工具应该改善，要求有关部门予以研究。
    第八，要发展山区的文教卫生事业，以便逐步地提高山区人民的文化水平和消除疾病。
    十项措施
    邓子恢的报告第四部分是为了完成上述任务应该采取的十项措施。
    他说，首先要做好思想动员工作，统一认识，明确方向，树立信心，鼓起劲头，面向山区，向山区进军。他强调要有让河水改路高山低头的气概去建设山区。领导干部要带头上山。各省、县要定期召开山区代表会议，听取山区人民的意见，解决他们的困难，鼓舞他们的信心。
    做好发展山区生产的全面规划，是一项重要的措施。他说，山区经济是综合性的，因此要全面规划，统一安排。在做规划的时候，既不要保守，也不要不切合实际。为此，要走群众路线，先要自上而下地提出指标，而后再自下而上地经过合作社根据具体情况切实讨论，制订规划；而后乡、县、省逐级作出切实可行的积极稳妥的规划，逐级加以综合平衡，最后定案。
    扭转山区人口外流，是解决山区劳动力不足的一个首要办法。他强调必须对山区人民做好思想教育工作，使他们安下心来进行生产建设。另外，还要动员广大城乡多余的劳动力上山，开发山区。
    为了发展山区生产，还要动员大批的优秀干部上山。他们要和农民同吃同住同劳动，而且还要担负起领导生产、组织生产的任务。因此，上山的干部，任务既艰巨又光荣。
    加强山区的商业工作是促进山区生产发展的重要环节。邓子恢说，要大力发展山区的商业网；在不能设立购销点的地方，可委托农业社代购代销；产、销地区还可直接见面，以便减少流转环节。他强调指出，在山区的商业工作中一个重要问题是价格问题，有些产品收购价格不完全适当的要予以调整；地区、品种、购销之间都要有合理差价。价格合理了，农民生产积极性才能提高。
    邓子恢还指出：加强技术支援，技术上山；国家给山区以必要的经济支援；重视民族工作，搞好民族团结；都是发展山区生产的重要措施。他对这些问题都作了详细的论述。
    他提出的最后一项措施是中共各省委员会必须对山区各项工作加强统一领导。这是建设山区的根本保证。各省都应该有一个书记或副省长专管山区工作。
    根据山区特点办好合作社
    他的报告第五部分是“办好和巩固山区农业生产合作社”。他说，建设山区主要是依靠合作社。山区有山区的特点，不能按平原的一套办法去办社，在社的规模和劳动组织上要因地因社制宜。山区生产门路很多，对社员应该按不同的活路和技术高低给以合理的劳动报酬，以提高社员的生产积极性。
    山区生产发展起来以后，社的收入很大。因此，应该在保证社员收入逐年有所增加的条件下多留一些公积金。收入太多的，还可以酌留一部储存备荒，不算公积金也不分掉。另外，在林区还可留下林业基金，用以发展林业。
    山区的副业生产门路很多，比较复杂。因此，副业生产经营范围的划分，也不应采取平原的一套办法，要因地因社制宜。
    山区生产商品性很大，这对社员不无影响。他强调指出，对社员经常进行社会主义集体主义的思想教育非常重要，要加强政治思想工作，防止资本主义自发思想的滋生。
