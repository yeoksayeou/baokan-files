American Dark Side

    Teacher Salaries Meager
    Currently, the United States not only lacks school buildings but also teachers. Teachers in the United States work hard, receive meager salaries, and are not respected, so few people are willing to become teachers. According to the American "Workers' Weekly," in thirty states, 70,000 teachers earn less than $2,500 per year. A survey report by the National Education Association stated that the average annual salary of teachers in the United States is $4,055, but it takes $5,500 per year to barely support a family of four in the United States. Because the salary is not enough to make ends meet, some teachers have changed careers, and some have to find ways to supplement their occupational income. Currently, more than half of the male teachers nationwide use their summer vacations to work in rural areas or do other forms of manual labor. Some teachers are not only working during the summer vacation but also during the school year, selling shoes, working as tour guides, managing affairs at outdoor resorts, operating elevators, tutoring, tending bars, working as day laborers on construction sites, or driving taxis. According to a report in the September 14th issue of the American "Saturday Review Magazine," in 1957, university professors, like elementary school teachers, are also looking for money elsewhere, spending the least amount of time on teaching. Some of their part-time jobs are: compiling textbooks, proofreading manuscripts, and serving as consultants to industry and commerce. They no longer have as much time for academic research.

    教师薪金菲薄
    目前美国不但校舍不够，而且师资缺乏。教师在美国工作繁重，薪金菲薄，不受尊敬，因此很少人愿意当教师。据美国“工人周报”报道，在三十个州有七万教师每年的薪金还不足二千五百美元。在美国教育协会调查报告中说到，美国教师的平均年薪是四千零五十五元，但在美国勉强维持四口之家的生活，每年需要五千五百元。由于薪金不够糊口，有的教师改了行，有的不得不千方百计地找钱来补他们的职业收入的不足。目前全国有一半以上的男教师利用暑假到农村从事劳动或作其他形式的体力劳动，有些教师不只是在暑假中而是在学年当中从事贩卖皮鞋，充当游客向导，管理野外休养所的事务，开电梯，作家庭教师，照料酒吧间，作建筑工地的零工或开出租汽车等工作。据9月14日美国“星期六评论杂志”报道，1957年的大学教授也跟小学教师一样，纷纷向别的方面去找钱，只以最少的时间用于教学。他们的一些兼职是：编纂教科书，校阅手稿，充任工商界的顾问。他们已经没有那末多的时间来从事学术研究。
