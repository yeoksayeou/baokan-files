What are the harms of children sucking on pacifiers?

Some mothers, as soon as they see their child crying, give the child milk; sometimes the child falls asleep while nursing, and the mother does not take the nipple away. In this way, the child gradually develops the habit of sleeping with the nipple in their mouth. And sometimes, because the mother is busy, she uses a pacifier to coax the child to sleep.

This habit is very bad and will affect the child's health. Because: When the child sucks on the pacifier, they will suck in a lot of air. If there is too much air in the gastrointestinal tract, it will affect food digestion, reduce the child's appetite, and even cause vomiting. This will cause malnutrition and hinder the child's growth and development.

Frequent sucking on a pacifier will create an upward pressure on the palate. Over time, the arch of the palate will deform, and the child's teeth will protrude forward in the future. This not only affects appearance but also prevents the upper and lower teeth from biting together well, affecting chewing, which in turn affects food digestion. At the same time, if chewing movements are affected, the chewing muscles will not develop properly, which will also affect the development of the jawbone, thus affecting the appearance of the face.

Sucking on a pacifier also makes it easy for children to ingest dirty things, which is very unhygienic and may even cause gastrointestinal diseases.

Sleeping with a pacifier in the mouth will cause the child to develop the habit of sleeping with their mouth open, which allows air to enter directly from the mouth without being filtered and warmed by the nose. Sleeping with the mouth open often causes saliva to flow from the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the mouth often become chapped and eroded due to moisture. Therefore, never let children suck on pacifiers.

### 孩子吸假奶头有哪些害处？

    孩子吸假奶头有哪些害处？
    有些做母亲的，一看见孩子哭了，就给孩子吃奶；有时候孩子一边吃奶一边睡着了，母亲还不把奶摘掉。这样，孩子逐渐地养成了含着奶头睡觉的习惯。而做母亲的有时因为忙，就用假奶头来哄孩子，使孩子入睡。
    这种习惯很不好，会影响孩子的健康。因为：当孩子吮吸假奶头的时候，会吸进很多空气。肠胃道的空气多了，就会影响食物的消化，减低孩子的食欲，甚至因此而发生呕吐。这就会引起营养不足的现象，妨碍了孩子的生长发育。
    常常吮吸假奶头，上颚就会产生一种向上的压力，久而久之，颚弓就会变形，将来孩子的牙齿会向前突出。这不但影响美观，而且使上下牙齿不能很好地咬合，影响咀嚼运动，也就影响食物的消化。同时，咀嚼运动受到了影响，会使咀嚼肌肉发育不健全，也影响颔骨的发育，因而使脸部的美观受到影响。
    吮吸假奶头也容易使孩子吃进脏东西，很不卫生，甚至因此引起肠胃病。
    含着假奶头睡觉，会使孩子养成张嘴睡觉的习惯，而使空气直接从口中进入，不经过鼻子过滤和进行加温。张嘴睡觉，唾液常从口角流出，口角常常因为潮湿而糜烂。因此，千万不要让孩子吸假奶头。
