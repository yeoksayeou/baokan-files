The broad cadres and peasants of Wuchang County actively study and discuss: Full of confidence in achieving the National Agricultural Development Program

    (Reported by our newspaper) After the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), it was warmly supported by the broad rural cadres and peasants in Wuchang County, Heilongjiang Province. In places where there was broadcasting in the county, the masses gathered together to listen to the broadcast after returning from the fields in the evening. Literate members also carefully read the National Agricultural Development Program published in the newspaper word by word. The sound of discussing the Agricultural Development Program could be heard everywhere, at the fields and around the dining table. The members reflected: The road is getting wider and wider, and the future is infinitely bright.

    After the promulgation of the Agricultural Development Program, more than 1,800 county, township, and commune cadres who were attending a meeting in the county launched a heated discussion. Everyone agreed that great achievements had been made in implementing the draft Agricultural Development Program in the past two years. Taking the development of farmland water conservancy as an example: in 1956, a mass upsurge of farmland water conservancy construction was set off throughout the county, developing 6,000 hectares of paddy fields. Although it suffered from severe flood disasters that year, the county's paddy fields achieved high yields, and agricultural cooperatives with an average yield of 9,000 catties per hectare emerged. This year, the county sold a total of 66,000 tons of grain, supporting national industrial construction. In 1957, the county developed another 5,000-plus hectares of paddy fields. Although it suffered from drought and frost disasters, the average yield per hectare of paddy fields still reached more than 6,000 catties. During the two years of implementing the Agricultural Development Program, the county's paddy fields increased from 12,000 hectares to 23,000 hectares, an increase of four times compared with before liberation, equivalent to the total development of paddy fields in the 22 years of the puppet Manchukuo regime. At the same time, more than 20,000 cubic meters of flood control and drainage projects were completed, preventing floods, enabling the county's farmland to achieve bumper harvests, and further improving the lives of farmers.

    Currently, some communes in Wuchang County are formulating and revising their own development plans based on the experience and lessons learned from implementing the Agricultural Development Program in the past two years, combined with local conditions.

    After inspecting the county's agricultural plan, the cadres believed that some of it was conservative and should be revised. For example, the original plan was to develop a total of 9,000 hectares of paddy fields in 1956-1957, but 11,000 hectares were developed, an increase of 2,000 hectares compared with the plan. After the plan is revised, all of the current 32,000 hectares of wasteland in the county will be reclaimed into fertile land by 1962, and by 1967, the county's cultivated land area will increase from 195,452 hectares in 1955 to 227,952 hectares; the rice area will reach 100,5757 hectares, accounting for 48% of the total cultivated land area. In order to complete this plan, in addition to separately brewing and formulating annual development plans, the county, townships, and communes are currently actively constructing water conservancy projects, planning to complete 70% of the earthwork for developing 7,000 hectares of paddy fields next year before the ground freezes.

### 五常县广大干部和农民积极学习讨论  实现农业发展纲要满怀信心

    五常县广大干部和农民积极学习讨论
    实现农业发展纲要满怀信心
    本报讯　全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布后，得到了黑龙江省五常县广大农村干部和农民的热烈拥护。该县凡是有广播的地方，群众晚间从地里回来就集中到一起去收听广播。识字的社员也一字一句地细心读着报纸上刊载的全国农业发展纲要，地头、饭桌旁，到处都可以听到讨论农业发展纲要的声音。社员们反映：道路越走越宽，前途无限美好。
    农业发展纲要公布后，正在县里开会的一千八百多名县、乡、社干部展开了热烈的讨论，大家一致认为，这两年来执行农业发展纲要草案已经取得了很大成绩。以农田水利的发展为例：1956年全县掀起了群众性的兴修水利高潮，发展了六千公顷水田，这年虽然受到了严重的洪水灾害，可是，全县水田却获得了高产，并出现了每公顷平均产量达到九千斤的农业社。这年全县共卖粮六万六千吨，支援了国家工业建设。1957年全县又发展水田五千余公顷，虽然遭到旱、冻双重灾害，每公顷水田平均产量还达六千斤以上。全县在执行农业发展纲要的两年间，水田在一万二千公顷的基础上增加到两万三千公顷，比解放前增加四倍，相等于伪满二十二年水田发展的总和。同时还完成两万多土方的防洪排涝工程，防止了水灾，使全县农田获得丰收，农民生活也进一步得到了改善。
    现在五常县部分社正结合本地情况，在总结两年来执行农业发展纲要的经验教训的基础上制定与修定本社的发展规划。
    全县农业规划经过检查，干部们认为有些保守，应该修订。如水田原计划1956-1957年共发展九千公顷，结果发展了一万一千公顷，比计划增加了二千公顷。规划修订后，全县到1962年以前要把现在的三万二千公顷荒地全部开成良田，到1967年全县耕地面积将由1955年十九万五千四百五十二公顷，增加到二十二万七千九百五十二公顷；水稻面积达到十万零五千七百五十七公顷，占总耕地面积的48％。为了完成这个规划，县、乡、社当前除分别酝酿制定逐年发展的规划外，正积极兴修水利工程，计划结冻前完成明年发展水田七千公顷的70％的土方工程。
