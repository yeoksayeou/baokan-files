Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Damascus News: The Syrian Parliament and forty members of the Egyptian National Assembly, who are currently visiting Syria, unanimously passed a resolution at a joint meeting on the evening of the 18th, requesting the governments of the two countries to hold immediate negotiations to discuss the establishment of a Syria-Egypt federation.

The resolution stated that Syrian and Egyptian parliamentarians "announced the desire of the Arab people of Syria and Egypt to establish a federation between the two countries," and they "expressed their approval of the measures taken by the governments of Syria and Egypt to establish this federation."

Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali delivered a speech at the meeting, reviewing the steps that had already been taken to establish the Syria-Egypt federation. He said: "The union of Syria and Egypt is no longer an imagination but a reality."

Al-Assali said: "After this union has been expressed to some extent in military, economic, and cultural aspects, the government promises to establish a comprehensive union between the two countries on the basis of pure Arab nationalism, and to participate in neither the East nor the West."

Syrian Parliament Speaker al-Hawrani, in his opening speech, vehemently condemned the United States for "exerting political and economic pressure on Syria" and launching a smear campaign against Syria.

During the parliamentary debate, speakers emphasized their condemnation of imperialists and Zionists. These speakers said that Syria and Egypt should express their gratitude to friendly countries, especially the Soviet Union, for the selfless and important assistance they provided, and are still providing, in difficult times.

When Egyptian parliamentarians voted alongside Syrian parliamentarians to take swift action on the establishment of the federation, cheers erupted in the crowded circular hall of the Syrian Parliament. Approximately two thousand people crowded the visitor's gallery, including prominent figures and foreign envoys to Syria. Another five thousand Syrians surrounded the Parliament building, listening to the loudspeaker broadcast of the enthusiastic speeches by Syrian and Egyptian parliamentarians in support of establishing the federation.

Syrian President Kuwatly's representative, cabinet ministers, the commander-in-chief of the army, Bizri, and officers from the Syrian-Egyptian joint command attended the meeting.

Syrian President Kuwatly said on the 18th that the proposed "establishment of the Syria-Egypt federation will be the prelude to Arab unity."

Kuwatly made these remarks at the opening meeting of the Arab Administrative Science Conference. Representatives from Syria, Jordan, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Yemen, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and the Arab League participated in this conference.

Kuwatly said that this conference "can help break down the obstacles set up by imperialists to oppose Arab unity."

Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on November 19: "The Syrian government will intensify its efforts to fully realize the Egypt-Syria federation." He told reporters that the Syrian government would establish special agencies to realize this precious national aspiration of the Arab people.

Foreign Minister Bitar also said on the same day that the Syrian government would appoint a delegation to hold negotiations with the Egyptian government to realize the Egypt-Syria federation.

The Egyptian parliamentary delegation visited the northern Syrian cities of Homs, Hama, and Aleppo on the 19th. Syrian officials and representatives from all walks of life in the aforementioned cities expressed their welcome to the establishment of a federation between Syria and Egypt in their speeches.

The head of the delegation, Sadat, said in Homs on the 19th that Syria is not isolated in its struggle against imperialism, but is supported by the entire Arab people. He also said that this unity of the Arab people cannot be shaken by any force.

Newspapers in Damascus and Cairo have published editorials welcoming the resolution unanimously passed by the joint meeting of Syrian and Egyptian parliamentarians calling for the establishment of a federation between the two countries.

Cairo News: The Egyptian National Assembly unanimously approved on the 18th the resolution passed on the same day at the Syrian-Egyptian parliamentary joint meeting held in the Syrian capital, requesting the governments of the two countries to immediately begin negotiations on the issue of realizing the proposed Syrian-Egyptian federation.

    本报综合报道　大马士革消息：叙利亚议会和正在叙利亚访问的四十名埃及国民议会议员在18日晚间的联席会议上一致通过决议，要求两国政府立即举行谈判，讨论成立叙利亚—埃及联邦问题。
    这项决议说，叙利亚议员和埃及议员“宣布了叙利亚和埃及的阿拉伯人民在这两个国家之间建立一个联邦的愿望”，他们“对叙利亚和埃及两国政府所采取的建立这个联邦的措施表示赞同。”
    叙利亚总理阿萨利在会上发表演说时追述了为建立叙利亚—埃及联邦而已经采取的步骤。他说：“叙利亚和埃及的联合已经不再是一种想像而是一种事实。”
    阿萨利说：“在军事、经济和文化方面在某种程度上表现了这种联合以后，政府答应在纯阿拉伯民族主义的基础上在两国之间建立全面的联合，并且既不参加东方，也不参加西方。”
    叙利亚议会议长胡拉尼在致开幕词时痛斥美国“对叙利亚施加政治和经济压力”和对叙利亚发动诽谤运动。
    在议会辩论时，各发言者着重谴责了帝国主义者和犹太复国主义者。这些发言者说，叙利亚和埃及要向友好国家，特别是苏联表示感谢，感谢它们在困难时期提供的、并且还在提供的无私的和重要的援助。
    当埃及议员同叙利亚议员一道投票就建立联邦问题迅速采取行动时，挤满了人的叙利亚议会的圆形大厅里发出了欢呼的声音。约有两千人拥挤在旁听席上，其中包括著名人士和外国驻叙利亚的使节。另有五千名叙利亚人围着议会大厅听扩音器转播叙利亚和埃及议员们支持建立联邦的热烈演说。
    叙利亚总统库阿特利的代表、内阁阁员们、军队总司令比兹里和叙利亚—埃及联合司令部的军官们都出席了这次会议。
    叙利亚总统库阿特利18日说，建议中的“叙利亚—埃及联邦的成立，将是阿拉伯团结的序幕”。
    库阿特利是在阿拉伯行政科学会议的开幕会议上说这番话的。参加这次会议的有叙利亚、约旦、苏丹、沙特阿拉伯、黎巴嫩、也门、埃及、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥等国和阿拉伯联盟的代表。
    库阿特利说，这次会议“能够有助于打破帝国主义分子为了反对阿拉伯团结而设立的障碍”。
    叙利亚总理阿萨利11月19日说：“叙利亚政府将加紧尽其所能使埃叙联邦完全实现。”他对记者说，叙利亚政府将成立一些特别机构来实现阿拉伯人民这一可贵的民族愿望。
    外交部长比塔尔在同一天也说，叙利亚政府将任命一个代表团负责和埃及政府举行谈判来实现埃叙联邦。
  埃及议会代表团19日访问了叙利亚北部城市霍姆斯、哈马和阿勒颇。上述各城市的叙利亚官员和各界代表在讲话中都表示欢迎叙利亚和埃及建立联邦。
    代表团团长萨达特19日在霍姆斯说，叙利亚在反对帝国主义的斗争中不是孤立的，而是得到全体阿拉伯人民支持的。他还说，阿拉伯人民这种团结是任何力量都不能动摇的。
    大马士革和开罗各报都发表社论欢迎叙埃议员联席会议一致通过要求建立两国联邦的决议。
    开罗消息：埃及国民议会18日一致批准当天在叙利亚首都举行的叙—埃议员联席会议所通过的要求两国政府就实现拟议中的叙—埃联邦问题立即开始谈判的决议。
