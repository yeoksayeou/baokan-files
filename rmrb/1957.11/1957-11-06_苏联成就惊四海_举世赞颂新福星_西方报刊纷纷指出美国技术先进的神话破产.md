Xinhua News Agency report: The Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite continues to be the focus of international attention. Cheers praising this other great achievement of the Soviet Union continue to pour in from all over the world.

    According to today's "Mongolian Truth" report, the Mongolian people believe that the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution is a new victory for Soviet scientists. The great achievements of the Soviet people and Soviet scientists are the fruits of the victory of the Great October Revolution.

    Citizens of the Indian capital enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements of the Soviet scientific community in launching a new Earth satellite much larger than the previous one. All the newspapers published the news of the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite on the front page with eye-catching banner headlines. They were extremely interested in the dog carried by the satellite.

    Jakarta's "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 5th, saying that the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite has strengthened mankind's confidence in eliminating the danger of war and uncovering the secrets of nature. The newspaper also said that this brilliant achievement of the Soviet Union is a major contribution to science. The superiority of Soviet science is a direct result of the October Socialist Revolution.

    The "Manila Chronicle" published a cartoon on its editorial page depicting a proud Ivan (Soviet Union) pointing upwards at two artificial Earth satellites and saying to a crestfallen and embarrassed Uncle Sam (United States): "See?"

    All Damascus newspapers published the news of the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite on the front page with banner headlines on November 4. "Al-Nour" published an editorial saying that any scientific achievement of the Soviet Union is a victory for world peace, a victory sufficient to weaken the strength of the warmongers and reduce the threat of war. The newspaper said that the Soviet Union's victory proves the superiority of the socialist system.

    France's "Le Figaro" pointed out that the Soviet Union has far surpassed the United States in technology. "Le Monde," after pointing out the Soviet Union's tremendous achievements in science and technology, said that the Soviet Union is far ahead of the United States in intercontinental missiles and space rockets. The newspaper said: This fact "better than any propaganda, can show the technological and material progress achieved by the revolution that will celebrate its fortieth anniversary this week." "Combat" emphasized that Soviet scientists have made great achievements in manipulating rockets, "but at the same time, the United States has failed several rocket tests because it has not reached perfection in this area." "Combat" wrote: "In forty years of vigorous development, the revolution has achieved an ideological victory and at the same time has made progress in the scientific field," and from then on, "Washington lost its superiority."

    British Education Minister Geoffrey Lloyd described the second artificial satellite as "a beautiful and amazing achievement in the magical field of science, and a new banner that heralds the rapid arrival of a new era of science." Labor MP Richard Crossman wrote in his column in the "Daily Mirror" today, "The second satellite has made the Americans lose their leadership and made it almost impossible for them to believe anything." Crossman said that Dulles' policy of massive retaliation and negotiating from a position of strength has finally collapsed. For six years, the Republican president of the United States and the Conservative prime ministers of Britain have acted on the assumption that the superior strength of the West can be used to force the Communists to accept Western conditions. "Now this idea has gone the way of the Western democracies' claim to be technologically superior to the backward Russians and Chinese." "The Scotsman" said, "Russian scientific prestige is soaring along with the satellite, and so is its political standing."

    West Germany's "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" wrote: "Human fantasies are beginning to come true. November 3, 1957, will go down in human history... This is a great day." West Berlin's "Berliner Morgenpost" said: The world's belief in American technological superiority has been further shattered.

    苏联成就惊四海　举世赞颂新福星
    西方报刊纷纷指出美国技术先进的神话破产
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：苏联发射第二个人造卫星继续成为国际舆论注意的中心。赞扬苏联这又一个伟大成就的欢呼，不断从世界各地传来。
    据蒙古“真理报”今天报道，蒙古人民认为，在十月革命四十周年前夕，苏联发射了第二颗人造卫星，是苏联科学家的新的胜利。苏联人民和苏联科学家所获得的巨大成就，是伟大十月革命胜利的果实。
    印度首都的市民热烈赞扬苏联科学界在发射比前一个大得多的新地球卫星上的光辉成就。所有的报纸都在第一版以醒目的通栏标题登载了苏联发射第二颗人造卫星消息。他们感到极大兴趣的是这颗卫星所携带的一只狗。
    雅加达“人民日报”在5日发表社论说，苏联发射第二颗人造卫星，增强了人类对消除战争危险以及揭开大自然的秘密的信心。这家报纸还说，苏联这一辉煌成就是对科学的重大贡献。苏联科学的优越性是十月社会主义革命的直接成果。
    “马尼拉纪事报”在它的社论版上登了一幅漫画，画着骄傲的伊凡（苏联）向上指着两颗人造地球卫星对垂头丧气窘困万状的山姆大叔（美国）说：“看见吗？”
    大马士革所有报纸11月4日都在第一版以通栏标题刊载了苏联发射第二颗人造卫星的消息。“光明报”发表社论说，苏联的任何科学成就都是世界和平的胜利，这种胜利足以削弱战争贩子的力量，减少战争的威胁。这家报纸说，苏联的胜利证明了社会主义制度的优越性。
    法国“费加罗报”指出了苏联在技术上大大超过了美国。“世界报”在指出了苏联科学技术方面的巨大成就以后说，苏联在洲际导弹和宇宙火箭方面远远走在美国前面。报纸说：这个事实“优于任何宣传，能够表明在本星期内就要庆祝它的四十周年的革命所取得的技术和物质的进步”。“战斗报”强调指出，苏联科学家在操纵火箭方面取得了巨大的成就，“但是与此同时，美国却因为在这方面没有达到完善地步以致好几个火箭都试验失败了。”“战斗报”写道：“在蓬勃发展的四十年间，革命取得了思想上的胜利，并且同时在科学领域也取得了进步”，从此“华盛顿失去了它的优越地位”。
    英国教育大臣乔弗雷·劳埃德把第二颗人造卫星说成是“在神奇的科学领域中漂亮的惊人成就，而且是预示着科学的新纪元迅速到来的一种新旗帜。”工党议员理查德·克罗斯曼今天在“每日镜报”的他的专栏中写道，“第二颗卫星使得美国人失去了领导地位，并且使得他们几乎无法相信什么主意了”。克罗斯曼说，杜勒斯的大规模报复和从实力地位进行谈判的政策已经最后垮台了。六年来美国的共和党总统和英国的保守党首相们都是依据下面这样的假定来行事的：可以利用西方的优势实力来迫使共产党人接受西方的条件。“现在这个想法已经和西方民主国家自称在技术上优于落后的俄国人和中国人的说法同归于尽了。”“苏格兰人报”说，“俄国的科学威信和卫星一道扶摇直上，它的政治地位也是这样。”
    西德“法兰克福总汇报”写道：“人类的幻想开始实现了。1957年11月3日将载入人类的史册……这是一个伟大的日子。”西柏林的“柏林日报”说：全世界关于美国技术先进的信念已经进一步被粉碎了。
