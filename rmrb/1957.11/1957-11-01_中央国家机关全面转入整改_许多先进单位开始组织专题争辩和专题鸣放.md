Xinhua News Agency, 31st: The rectification movement in central state organs, focusing on rectification, has been fully launched. By the end of October, 90% of the departments, bureaus, and equivalent units, after achieving a decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, had entered the third stage of the rectification movement.

Twenty-five ministries and equivalent units have held mobilization meetings and are now fully engaged in the "Big Airing, Big Blooming" (大鸣大放). The common practice in various organs is to first call on the masses to universally air their views, without specifying topics or scope, encouraging them to freely and widely expose and criticize shortcomings in leadership work such as bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism. Then, they summarize the opinions of the masses, grasp the main issues, and systematically launch special debates and special airing of views. This allows the rectification movement to unfold in depth like waves, one high tide following another. Currently, many advanced units have largely completed their general airing of views. For example, the entire Ministry of Aquatic Products and parts of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Second Ministry of Machine Building have begun organizing special debates and special airing of views.

Leading Cadres Concretely Lead the Rectification Movement

The third stage of rectification is crucial to the success of the entire rectification movement, and how to mobilize the masses to fully air their views is the central link of the current movement. The experience of many organs shows that the key to launching a high tide of airing views lies first in how the responsible persons and Party organizations of each organ earnestly strengthen leadership as the movement develops. The determination of the leadership is not only manifested in deeply relying on the masses, mobilizing them, and conscientiously doing ideological work to dispel their concerns and encourage and support them in airing their views, but also in whether leading cadres, Party members, and Communist Youth League members stand at the forefront of the movement and take the lead in airing their views, using actions to promote and influence the masses. In addition, the leadership must, with a high degree of responsibility, earnestly study the various contradictions in the work of the organs, carefully analyze and study the large number of criticisms from below, and closely integrate rectification with the airing of views. This will promote the in-depth development of the movement. Now, many organs have assigned most of their leading cadres to concretely lead this movement. The Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Aquatic Products, and other units are now working very intensely. They are organizing a large force to understand the situation of the masses, collect various criticisms, classify them for research, and study rectification in a timely manner. During the "Big Airing, Big Blooming" in the Rubber Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, Vice Minister Xiao Guichang personally went to the bureau to supervise and inspect. After repeated mobilizations and rectifications alongside the airing of views, this bureau continuously organized three high tides of airing views, inspiring the masses to put forward more than 900 opinions.

Leading Cadres, Party Members, and Communist Youth League Members Take the Lead in Airing Views

It is of great significance for leading cadres to participate in the airing of views. Some organs have specially organized leading cadres to air their views. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has held three symposiums of cadres at the bureau-director level and above. At these meetings, many fundamental problems in the leadership work of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry were raised. The Ministry of Aquatic Products has had long-standing disputes over the direction of the aquatic products industry that have not been resolved. Now, it is organizing the masses and leading cadres to launch a "Big Debate, Big Blooming." The Ministry of Commerce has convened a symposium of cadres at the bureau-director level for more than two weeks. In conjunction with conveying the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, a wide-ranging discussion was launched on the work of the Ministry of Commerce. Many leading cadres in the organs also posted big-character posters together with the masses. After the leading Party member cadres of the Ministry of Foreign Trade took the lead in airing their views and some company managers posted big-character posters, they encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses in airing their views. Now, this ministry has collected more than 3,000 criticisms in twelve units.

Timely Improvement of Work Encourages the Masses to Air Their Views

The close integration of airing views and rectification has greatly promoted the movement. Many organs have quickly improved problems raised by the masses that can be immediately rectified with a vigorous revolutionary spirit. On the first day of airing views at the Transportation, Electrical, and Equipment Company under the Ministry of Commerce, the leadership organized the opinions of the masses in the evening, and the next day the manager of the company held a meeting to study how to improve the shortcomings pointed out by the masses. This greatly encouraged the masses. After the first day of mobilization in the Ministry of Urban Construction, the masses posted big-character posters the next day. The leadership found from the big-character posters that the masses still had concerns, so they immediately studied and improved things that could be done and announced the results of the handling. After doing this, more than 300 big-character posters quickly appeared.

The process of moving from general airing of views to special airing of views, from mass airing of views to the airing of views by leading cadres, not only with airing of views but also with rapid rectification, reflects the in-depth development of the rectification movement in central state organs.

The work of the central state organs affects the whole country, especially many important policies, institutional systems, and regulations of various departments. These issues need to be improved only after full and repeated discussions between the leadership and the masses. It is impossible to solve all problems immediately during the airing of views. Therefore, some organs have proposed that "rectification should face the whole country" and called on the masses to "air comprehensively and debate on key points." Now, various organs have made arrangements for the steps of rectification. Many organs have decided that after the general airing of views comes to an end, they will first launch special debates and special airing of views on issues such as principles, policies, and tasks. Other issues will be arranged to be resolved step by step.

Some Organs are Still Hesitant or Even Standing Still; Some Leaders Still Have Bureaucratic Work Styles in Leading the Rectification

The development of the rectification movement in central state organs is still uneven. Some organs have not seized the opportunity in leadership, and the movement is progressing slowly; some have even ended the anti-Rightist struggle long ago, but they are still standing still, waiting for "unified deployment and unified action." The leadership of these organs has not yet realized how much disadvantage delaying the opportunity will cause to future work. Although some leaders of organs are leading the rectification movement, they still show bureaucratic work styles. They have not thoroughly understood the situation with the development of the movement and have not fully done ideological work. Some are satisfied with one mobilization meeting and have not repeatedly and deeply mobilized the masses. Therefore, although the movement to air views has been launched, it is not deep or thorough. In addition, some organs have begun to show formalism in rectification. Some are only pursuing how many items have been changed, without truly starting from the actual situation of the work of the organs and from the requirements of the masses, and solving some urgent problems that can be solved with a practical and truly rectifying spirit. Some even simply "assign the departments to handle" the opinions raised by the masses, treating this as if the work has already been improved. In addition, it was also found that individual leading cadres with more serious shortcomings in their work style adopted a passive attitude towards the movement. They were "drawing circles," "setting frameworks," and even suppressing the airing of views by the masses. There are also some leading cadres with shortcomings who are still in a state of numbness and unconsciousness. They pay attention to "educating others" and have not thought about how to "educate themselves." Therefore, they have no idea how to inspire the masses to burn off the "three isms" on their bodies. Some have a sense of complacency, thinking that they have changed "almost enough." These problems are hindering the development of the movement to a certain extent.

    中央国家机关全面转入整改
    许多先进单位开始组织专题争辩和专题鸣放
    新华社31日讯　中央国家机关着重以整改为主的整风运动已经全面展开，到10月底有90％的司、局和相当于司、局一级的单位在反右派斗争取得决定性胜利以后，转入了整风第三阶段。
    已经有二十五个部和相当于部一级的单位举行了动员大会，现在正在全面展开大鸣大放。各机关比较普遍的作法是首先号召群众普遍地鸣放，不出题目，不规定范围，发动群众自由地、广泛地揭露和批评领导工作上的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义等缺点，然后归纳群众的意见，抓住主要问题，有步骤地展开专题争辩、专题鸣放。这样使整风运动像波浪一样，一个高潮接着一个高潮地深入展开。目前，许多先进单位普遍鸣放已经大体结束，如水产部全部和化工部、轻工业部、第二机械工业部的一部分单位，都已开始组织专题争辩、专题鸣放。
    领导干部具体地领导整风运动
    整风第三阶段是决定全部整风运动成败的关键，而在第三阶段中如何发动群众充分地鸣放又是当前运动的中心环节。许多机关的经验表明，掀起鸣放高潮的关键问题，首先在于各机关的负责人和党的组织如何随着运动的发展，切实地加强领导。领导的决心不仅表现在深入地依靠群众、发动群众，切实地作好思想工作，解除他们的顾虑，鼓励和支持他们鸣放，而且表现在领导干部、党员和团员等是否站在运动的第一线，带头鸣放，用行动来推动、影响群众。除此以外，领导方面还必须以高度负责的精神，切实地研究机关工作中的各种矛盾，认真地分析研究来自下层的大量的千百条批评意见，并且在鸣放中紧密结合整改，这样就能推动运动深入发展。现在，许多机关都抽出大部分领导干部来具体地领导这个运动。化工部、商业部、水产部等单位，现在工作都非常紧张，他们组织很大力量来了解群众的情况，搜集各种批评意见，分类进行研究，并且及时研究整改。化工部橡胶工业管理局在大鸣大放时，副部长萧桂昌亲自到局里督促检查，这个局经过反复的三次动员，并且边鸣放边整改，结果连续组织了三次鸣放高潮，启发群众提出了九百多条意见。领导干部、党员和团员带头鸣放
    领导干部参加鸣放有重要的意义，有的机关专门组织了领导干部鸣放。冶金工业部已召开了三次司、局长以上干部座谈会，会上提出了冶金工业部领导工作上很多根本性的问题。水产部对水产事业的方针问题有着长期的争论，没有解决，现在正组织群众和领导干部一起来展开大争大辩。商业部已经召集司、局长一级干部开了二星期多的座谈会，结合传达中共三中全会的决议，对商业部的工作展开了广泛的讨论。许多机关的领导干部还同群众一起贴大字报，对外贸易部党员领导干部带头鸣放，有些公司的经理贴了大字报以后，鼓舞了群众鸣放的热情，现在这个部已在十二个单位中收集了三千多条批评意见。及时改进工作鼓励群众鸣放
    鸣放紧密结合整改对运动起了很大的推动作用。凡是群众提出的能够马上改的问题，许多机关都以雷厉风行的革命精神迅速加以改进。商业部所属的交通电料器材公司第一天鸣放，领导方面在晚上就整理群众的意见，第二天这个公司的经理就开会研究如何改进群众指出的缺点，这样做对群众鼓舞很大。城市建设部第一天动员以后，第二天群众贴出了大字报，领导上从大字报上发现群众还有顾虑，便立即研究改进那些可能办到的事情，并且宣布了处理的情况，这样做了以后，很快就出现了三百多张大字报。
    从一般鸣放到专题鸣放，从群众鸣放到领导干部的鸣放，不仅有鸣放，而且有迅速整改的行动，这种作法反映了中央国家机关整风运动深入发展的过程。
    中央国家机关的工作影响全国，特别像各部门许多重大的方针政策、机构体制和规章制度等问题，都需要经过领导和群众充分地反复地讨论以后才能进行改进，不可能一切问题都在鸣放中立即解决，因此，有的机关提出“整改要面向全国”，号召群众“全面的放，重点的争”。现在，各机关在整改的步骤上大都已作了安排，许多机关决定在一般鸣放告一段落以后，首先对方针、政策、任务等问题展开专题争辩，专题鸣放。其他问题都将有步骤地安排解决。
    有的机关还在迟迟不前甚至按兵不动有的领导人在领导整风中还有官僚主义作风
    中央国家机关整风运动的发展还不平衡，有的机关在领导上还没有抓紧时机，运动迟迟不前；有的甚至反右派斗争早已结束，还按兵不动，等待“统一部署，统一行动”。这些机关的领导方面还没有认识延误时机会对今后的工作造成多大的不利。有的机关领导人虽在领导整风运动，却仍然表现出有官僚主义的作风，他们没有随着运动的发展，深入地了解情况，充分地做思想工作，有的满足于一次动员大会，没有反复地深入地发动群众，因此鸣放运动虽已发动，却并不深不透。另外，有的机关在整改中，开始出现有形式主义的现象，有的仅仅追求改了多少条，没有真正从机关工作的实际情况出发，从群众的要求出发，踏实地真正以整风的精神解决一些可能解决的迫切问题。有的甚至把群众提出的意见简单地“责成科室处理”，这样就当作已经改进了工作。另外，还发现个别作风上有较严重缺点的领导干部，对运动采取消极态度，他们“画圈圈”，“定框框”，甚至压制群众鸣放。还有些有缺点的领导干部，至今还处在一种麻痹的不自觉的状态，他们注意了“教育别人”，没有想到如何“教育自己”，因此他们没有想法启发群众来烧掉自己身上的“三个主义”。有的存在自满情绪，认为改的“差不多了”。这些问题都在一定程度上阻碍了运动的发展。
