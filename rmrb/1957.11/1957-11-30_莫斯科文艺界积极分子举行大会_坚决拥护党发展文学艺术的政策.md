Moscow Literary and Art Activists Hold a Meeting
Firmly Supporting the Party's Policy of Developing Literature and Art

(Dispatch from our newspaper in Moscow, November 29) Throughout the capital cities and major cities of the various Soviet republics, literary and art workers' conferences have been widely held. These conferences discussed the speech by Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, on "Literature and art must maintain close contact with the life of the people." Writers and poets, artists and composers, theater and film workers in various places have warmly supported the Party's correct line on literature and art.

On November 27, a conference of activists from the literary and art circles of the Soviet capital was held in the Hall of Columns of the Moscow Trade Union Building. Furtseva, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, and secretary of the Moscow City Party Committee, attended the conference and spoke at the closing session. Surkov, First Secretary of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union, delivered a report at the meeting. He said that Khrushchev's speech had aroused enthusiastic responses and discussions in Soviet literary and art circles. This kind of discussion on literary and artistic thought is a manifestation of the Soviet intellectuals' closer unity around the Communist Party and its Central Committee, and a proof of the active life of the Soviet creative teams and the broad prospects for the development of literature and art. The speaker criticized works that distorted Soviet reality and misinterpreted the cause of communist construction. He said that voices, either openly or covertly, against socialist realism had appeared in publications. At the same time, linked to this revisionist tendency was the attempt to question the principle of the Party spirit of literature and art and the principle of the Party's leadership over literature and art. Surkov said that when the Soviet Union launched the artificial satellite, he was in Italy. A writer there told him that the artificial satellite made people believe that what was described in Dudintsev's novel "Not by Bread Alone" was a distortion of the reality of the Soviet system and the scientific community. Surkov said that not only artificial satellites but also the forty years of Soviet development were enough to refute those authors who preferred weeds. The speaker said that Khrushchev's speech gave timely and powerful assistance to workers in literature, art, and music. The Party calls on literary and artistic creators to always go deep among the people and more deeply understand the phenomena of social and political life.

The conference, attended by 1,200 literary and art workers, held lively discussions. The speakers unanimously expressed their willingness to create better for the people in accordance with the Party's call. All the speeches were filled with gratitude for the Party's policy of promoting literature and art.

Khrennikov, Secretary of the Board of the Soviet Composers' Union, said that no capitalist country has such rich musical creation as our socialist country. For example, many new and good works have appeared recently to celebrate the October Revolution. However, in order to further improve musical art, it is necessary to wage a resolute and thorough struggle for the purity of creative thought. Certain musical workers have made revisionist remarks on the issue of the Party's leadership over art and on the evaluation of the achievements of Soviet musical creation. The journal "Soviet Music" had made such mistakes. Khrushchev's speech helped the music community to unite and correct these mistakes.

Film director Pyryev spoke about how Soviet cinema has grown under the care of the Party. He said that the Soviet Union now has several thousand film creation and technical personnel. All the member republics have their own film studios, and the Moscow Film Studio is one of the best in Europe. Last year, more than 3 billion people watched movies. In addition, Soviet films are also very popular abroad. He said that the tasks that the Party has put forward to the literary and art circles are very timely. Recently, many good films have been made, but at the same time, many gray and bad films have also appeared. Some experienced experts and young creators have begun to tend to reflect only the dark side of Soviet social life. Some people with this tendency even asserted that they reflect the negative phenomena in order to fight for the positive phenomena. This kind of argument is obviously incorrect. We should let the whole world see the best and most beautiful qualities of the Soviet people in Soviet films. At the same time, in order to make good films, in addition to hard work, the most important thing is to have close ties with the life of the people, become an inseparable part of the people, and constantly fight for the people's bright future.

Okhlopkov, chief director of the Mayakovsky Theatre, pointed out that modern bourgeois culture is decadent and corrupt, and the mission of Soviet artists is to bring the brilliant spirit of humanism to the people. Writer Katayev called on literary and art workers to struggle against the hostile influence of bourgeois ideology, to get as close as possible to the working people, to get close to the Communist Party, and to be loyal to proletarian internationalism. He said that Khrushchev's speech made people aware of a simple and clear fact, namely, that all failures are often due to the artist's detachment from the masses and to forgetting the lives of workers and peasants.

After Sveshnikov, president of the Moscow Conservatory, talked about the issue of cultivating young people and improving the aesthetic ability of workers, Melik-Pashayev, chief director of the Bolshoi Theatre, talked about the fact that the Bolshoi Theatre actors should go to various republics to tour.

Puppet master Obraztsov believes that the highest happiness of creation is for artists to become one with the people. He said that Soviet artists serve the Soviet people, thus standing at the forefront of the struggle for communism, for the friendship of all ethnic groups, and for peace. If any of them does not feel the organic connection with the basic course of domestic and world socio-politics, then he will certainly not be fruitful in creation. The young film actress Nifontova criticized some film scripts for not being ambitious enough, not having enough vivid material, and not being clear in thought, causing actors and directors to fail. She said that we owe the people a debt. We must strive to create on the screen images of modern characters that are loved by the audience, such as labor heroes, reclamation pioneers, Antarctic conquerors, and scientists who are attacking space. Like many speakers, Soviet People's Artist Johanson regarded Khrushchev's speech as a powerful mobilization, which mobilized all the forces of the art world to assist the people in carrying out communist construction.

    莫斯科文艺界积极分子举行大会
    坚决拥护党发展文学艺术的政策
    本报莫斯科29日电　在苏联各个加盟共和国的首都和各大城市，普遍举行了文艺工作者大会，这些大会讨论了苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫关于“文学艺术要同人民的生活保持密切的联系”的讲话。各地作家和诗人，美术家和作曲家，戏剧和电影工作者，都热烈地拥护党的正确的文艺路线。
    11月27日，在莫斯科工会大厦的圆柱大厅举行了苏联首都文艺工作者积极分子大会。苏共中央主席团委员、苏共中央书记兼莫斯科市委书记福尔采娃参加了大会并且在大会闭幕时发了言。苏联作家协会理事会第一书记苏尔科夫在会上作了报告。他说，赫鲁晓夫的讲话引起了苏联文艺界的热烈反应和讨论。这种关于文艺思想的讨论，是苏联知识分子更加紧密地团结在共产党和它的中央委员会的周围的表现，是苏联创作队伍生活活跃和文艺发展前途广阔的证明。报告人批评了那些歪曲苏维埃的现实和曲解共产主义建设事业的作品。他说，在刊物上出现过或明或暗地反对社会主义现实主义的声音。同时，和这种修正主义的倾向有联系的，是企图怀疑文学和艺术的党性原则、怀疑党对文艺的领导的原则。苏尔科夫说，当苏联发射人造卫星时，他正在意大利。那里一位文学家告诉他，人造卫星使人相信，杜津采夫的小说“不只是为了面包”中所描写的事情是歪曲了苏维埃制度和科学界的现实。苏尔科夫说，不仅人造卫星而且苏联发展的四十年成就都足以驳斥那些偏爱莠草的作者。报告人说，赫鲁晓夫的讲话给文学、美术、音乐工作者们以及时的有力的援助。党号召文艺创作者永远要深入到人民当中去，更深刻地理解社会和政治生活的现象。
    这有一千二百文艺工作者参加的大会进行了活跃的讨论。发言者一致表示愿意按照党的号召更好地为人民创作。所有的话都贯穿了对党的繁荣文艺的方针的感激。
    苏联作曲家协会理事会书记赫连尼科夫说，任何一个资本主义国家都没有我们社会主义国家这样丰富的音乐创作。例如，最近为了庆祝十月革命节，就出现了许多新的好作品。但是为了进一步提高音乐艺术，必须为创作思想的纯洁进行坚决和彻底的斗争。某些音乐工作者在党领导艺术问题上，在评价苏联音乐创作的成就上，有过修正主义的言论。“苏维埃音乐”刊物就犯过这种错误。赫鲁晓夫的讲话帮助音乐界团结起来，纠正了这种错误。
    电影导演佩里耶夫谈到苏联电影在党的关怀下成长的情形。他说，苏联现在有几千电影创作和技术人员。所有加盟共和国都有本民族的制片厂，莫斯科制片厂是欧洲最好的一个。去年看电影的有三十多亿人次。此外，苏联电影在国外也很受欢迎。他说党向文艺界提的任务是非常及时的。最近以来，拍制了许多好影片，同时也出现了许多灰色的、不好的影片。某些有经验的专家和青年创作者开始倾向于仅仅反映苏联社会生活的阴暗面。有这种倾向的人竟断言说，他们反映反面现象是为正面现象而斗争。这种论调显然是不正确的。我们应该让全世界在苏联电影中看到苏联人的最优良的、最美好的品质。同时要拍制好影片，除了需要勤劳外，最主要的是需要同人民的生活密切联系，成为人民中不可分割的部分，经常为人民的光辉的未来而斗争。
    马雅可夫斯基剧院总导演奥赫洛普科夫指出，现代资产阶级文化是堕落腐化的，而苏联艺术家的使命是要把光辉的人道主义精神带给人们。作家卡达耶夫号召文艺工作者同敌对的资产阶级思想影响作斗争，尽量靠近劳动人民，靠近共产党，忠于无产阶级的国际主义。他说，赫鲁晓夫的讲话使人们意识到一个简单明了的事实，即一切失败经常是由于艺术家脱离群众，是由于忘记了工人和农民的生活。
  在莫斯科音乐院院长斯维什尼科夫谈了培养青年和提高劳动者审美能力问题之后，大剧院总导演麦利克—帕沙耶夫谈到大剧院演员应该下到各共和国去巡回演出的事。
    木偶戏大师奥布拉兹卓夫认为艺术家和人民打成一片是创造的最高幸福。他说，苏联艺术家为苏联人民服务，从而站在为共产主义、为各族人民的友谊、为和平斗争的前线。如果他们当中谁不感觉到同国内和世界社会政治的基本行程的有机联系，那么他在创作上一定会没有成果。年青的电影女演员尼芬托娃批评某些电影脚本的气魄不大，生动的材料不多，思想不明确，使演员和导演失败。她说，我们欠着人民的债。我们要努力在银幕上创造为观众所喜爱的现代人物的形象。如劳动英雄，开荒者，南极洲的征服者，空间冲击的科学家等。和许多发言者一样，苏联人民画家约甘桑把赫鲁晓夫的讲话看作有力的动员，它动员所有艺术界的力量去协助人民进行共产主义建设。
