Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 11th: TASS reports from Moscow: The second artificial satellite has entered its ninth day and night of operation. As of 6:00 AM Moscow time on November 11th, it had orbited the Earth 110 times, covering a distance of 5.06 million kilometers. The launch of the second artificial satellite, equipped with sophisticated scientific instruments and capable of transmitting measurement data back to Earth, is a further significant contribution to the study of physical and physiological phenomena under interstellar flight conditions.

The scientific research program associated with obtaining data from the satellite was originally planned for seven days and nights. Now, this scientific research program has been fully completed. Valuable medical and physiological data on the survival conditions of biological organisms during long-term space flight, information on the intensity of solar radiation in the short-wave, ultraviolet, and X-ray spectrum, cosmic rays, and radio wave propagation, as well as data on temperature and pressure, have been obtained. The obtained data are undergoing thorough analysis and research.

According to the measurement plan, the transmitters and telemetry instruments on the satellite, which emit radio signals at frequencies of 40 MHz and 20 MHz, have ceased operation. Observations of the second artificial satellite's operation and predictions of its future orbit will be carried out using optical and radio positioning equipment, as with the first satellite and its carrier rocket. In the future, only those regions where the satellite can be seen with the naked eye, based on light conditions, will be announced for observing the second satellite.

    运行八个昼夜　送回大批资料
    新卫星科学研究计划已完成
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科电：第二个人造卫星的运行已经进入了第九个昼夜。到11月11日莫斯科时间早上六点为止，它绕地球转了一百一十圈，飞过了五百零六万公里的路程。发射装备有复杂的科学仪器和能够把测量资料传给地球的仪器的第二个人造卫星，对星际飞行条件下的物理现象和生理现象的研究，是一项进一步的重大贡献。
    与从卫星上获得资料有关的科学研究计划，原来预计为七昼夜。现在这个科学研究计划已经全部完成。获得了关于生物机体在长期宇宙飞行中生存条件的珍贵的医学——生理学资料，关于太阳在短波、紫外线和X光谱段的辐射强度、宇宙线和无线电波传播的资料，关于温度、压力的资料等等。获得的资料正在进行周密的分析和研究。
    根据测量计划，卫星上发射频率为四十兆赫（周）和二十兆赫（周）无线电讯号的发射台和遥测仪器停止工作。对于第二个人造卫星运行的观测及其今后运行的预测将用光学和无线电定位设备进行，同第一个卫星及其运载火箭一样。今后，为了观测第二个卫星，只公布那些根据光线照射条件能够用肉眼看到卫星的地区。
