    Confusing Two Different Academic Views
    In your newspaper's October 30th "Academic Trends" column introducing "A Year of Korean Historical Science," there are some errors that should be corrected: (1) The article mentions "Chosun Ilbo". However, there is no such newspaper in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. (Editor's note: It should be "Chosun Wolbo" [Korean Monthly Report]) (2) The article says "Represented by Lee Eung-su, Kim Kwang-jin, etc... they believe that the Three Kingdoms period skipped the slave system and directly entered feudal society." The views of Lee Eung-su and Kim Kwang-jin are completely different. They had a debate on this in the Korean "Historical Science" magazine. Lee Eung-su does not deny the existence of a slave society in Korea. He believes that the slave-owning system not only existed in the Three Kingdoms period—its remnants were preserved even late, that is, preserved until the Silla unification period, and even until the Goryeo period. But Kim Kwang-jin opposes Lee Eung-su's view. He denies that a slave society existed in Korea, and argues that Korea directly transitioned from a primitive social system to a feudal social system.

    混淆了两个不同的学术见解
    你报10月30日“学术动态”栏介绍了“一年来的朝鲜历史科学”，其中有些错误是应该纠正的：（一）文中提到“朝鲜日报”，查朝鲜民主主义人民共和国并没有这种报纸。（编者按：应为“朝鲜月报”）（二）文中说“以李应洙、金洸镇等为代表……认为三国是跃过奴隶制而直接进入封建社会的”。李应洙和金洸镇两人的见解是完全不同的，他们曾在朝鲜“历史科学”杂志上争鸣过。李应洙并不否认朝鲜的奴隶社会，他认为奴隶占有制不仅存在于三国时代——它的残余甚至保留很晚，即保留到新罗统一时期，甚至到高丽时代。但金洸镇反对李应洙的看法，他否认朝鲜存在过奴隶社会，而主张朝鲜直接从原始社会制度过渡到封建社会制度的。
