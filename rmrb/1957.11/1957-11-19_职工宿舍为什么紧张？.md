    Why is Employee Housing So Tight?
    A factory under the Second Ministry of Machine Building in East China recently conducted a survey on employee housing. The survey revealed some noteworthy issues.
    This factory is located in a densely populated urban area. Aside from the original housing and some that has been newly built in recent years, the majority of employee housing is leased from private owners. In recent years, the number of dormitories has increased considerably. The specific situation is shown in the following table: (Attached Table)
    Moreover, the rate of increase in dormitory area has exceeded the rate of increase in the number of employees. Compared to 1954, the number of employees increased by 10% in 1955, while the dormitory area increased by 14%. Compared to 1955, the number of employees increased by 40% in 1956, while the dormitory area increased by 46%. In 1957, the number of employees not only did not increase but gradually decreased. However, the housing problem became increasingly acute. At the time of the investigation, more than two hundred households were clamoring for housing.
    Why is it that even though the factory has done its utmost to solve the housing problem for employees, it still cannot meet the needs of the employees?
    Too Many Employee Family Members Arriving at the Factory
    The investigation revealed that a large number of employee family members coming to the factory is a significant reason for the housing shortage.
    In recent years, the rate of increase in the number of family households has exceeded the rate of increase in the number of employees. In 1956, the total number of employees increased by 40% compared to 1955, but the number of family households increased by 56.16%. In absolute terms, the number of employees increased by 1,351, of which 1,300 were young apprentices, but the number of family members increased by 1,007 households. In 1957, the number of employees was gradually decreasing, but the number of family members continued to increase. In 1954, there were only 1,628 employee family households in the entire factory. This number increased to 2,800 in 1956, and then to 2,905 by the end of May 1957.
    A large proportion of employee family members came to the factory after the wage reform last year and the realization of advanced agricultural cooperatives in rural areas. Some junior high school graduates who joined the factory last year were promoted to second-grade workers within a few months of joining, and their income increased. Those who had spouses brought them over, and those who didn't have spouses quickly got married. According to incomplete statistics, from September 1956 to June 1957, 171 young couples got married in the entire factory, averaging one marriage every one and a half days. Correspondingly, an average of one person every one and a half days had to ask the factory for a room. According to statistics at the end of May 1957, young workers and apprentices below the fourth grade who brought their families accounted for 57.29% of the total number of employee family households in the entire factory. Last year, some employee family members also flowed into the city because of a mistaken understanding of agricultural cooperation and rural life. For example, the family members of Huang Biding, an employee of the Housing Department, originally had a good life in rural production and life, but after the advanced agricultural cooperation in rural areas in 1956, they mistakenly believed that the land had been nationalized and rural life was difficult, so the whole family moved into the factory. After arriving at the factory, the son could not find a job and went everywhere to do temporary work, and the daughter-in-law was also idle and had nothing to do. The family's life became difficult, and they also asked the factory for relief.
    With so many family members living in the factory, there are also many children born. According to preliminary statistics, more than 800 children were born to employees of the entire factory last year, averaging more than two per day.
    Among the family members living in the factory, many are non-direct relatives or non-dependent relatives. It is simply that any relative, however distant, who has a connection with an employee, runs to live in the factory's housing. According to the investigation, among the 2,905 family households in the factory at the end of May 1957, 433 households had non-direct relatives, a total of 530 people. Details are shown in the following table: (Attached Table)
    These people do not even include non-direct relatives who take care of children and manage household chores for employees. Only a small part of these people have lost their ability to work or have no means of support, and the vast majority are young and strong and can participate in labor in rural areas.
    In the family dormitories, there are also a small number of so-called "illegal residents." They are mostly relatives and friends of employees, have household registration in rural areas, and do not bring household registration certificates when they come. They stay for several months to a year or so. Some want to find jobs, and some do business.
    With so many family members living in the factory, the housing problem is naturally tight.
    The economic lives of many employees have also become strained as a result, and some have even experienced difficulties. The family of Huang Biding mentioned earlier is an example. Another example is Zhang Zhongxiao, a fifth-grade worker. His family used to participate in agricultural production in the countryside, and his monthly salary, in addition to his own expenses, could be sent back to his hometown, and his life was quite prosperous. In the second half of 1956, he brought his five family members to the factory, but his son had no job, and life became difficult. Zhang Zhongxiao was distressed and his enthusiasm for production was also affected.
    Unreasonable Fee System
    The investigation also revealed that some employees who originally had housing in the local area also asked the factory for housing. More than 900 households are permanent residents in the suburbs. According to a preliminary investigation, 108 of these households have already returned their houses or subleased them, and some have even rented out their own houses or rented them to the factory, and then brought their families to ask the factory for houses.
    Why is this?
    The reason is that the factory's fee system is unreasonable. The situation regarding rent charges and water and electricity subsidies can be seen from the following three tables. (Attached Tables)
    Note: Water and electricity fees are only subsidized for employees living in factory-owned housing, and no subsidies are given to employees living in rented private housing. (Attached Table)
    In addition, according to a survey of 1,367 households, 1,114 households pay rent ranging from 30 cents to 90 cents, accounting for 81.49%. The rest are also much lower than the general rent on the market. Taking the private houses rented by the factory in December 1956 as an example, the rent paid by the factory was 4,281 yuan, while the rent paid by employees to the factory was only 686 yuan, a difference of 5.24 times.
    Under these circumstances, many employees who originally had housing in the local area naturally prefer to ask the factory for housing. Some people even sell their furniture and then apply to the factory for furniture to use.
    Some employees who have been transferred away from the factory are therefore reluctant to return their houses for a long time. Only the employees of the cooperative and the children's school that originally belonged to this factory have not returned their houses for a long time after these units were transferred to the local government, occupying more than 40 rooms in 20 households.
    The unreasonable fee system has exacerbated the housing shortage.
    The unreasonable fee system has also caused economic losses to the state. From 1954 to 1956, the factory's expenses for rent, repairs, water and electricity subsidies, furniture and supplies amounted to 299,246 yuan. This amount accounts for 5.7% of the factory's total profit for three years, which is equal to 75% of the factory's enterprise bonus fund for three years.

### 职工宿舍为什么紧张？

    职工宿舍为什么紧张？
    第二机械工业部在华东地区的一个工厂，最近对职工宿舍方面的情况作了调查。调查中发现了一些值得注意的问题。
    这个工厂设在一个人口比较集中的市区里，职工宿舍除厂内原有和几年来新建的一部分外，绝大部分是由厂方租赁的民房。这几年，宿舍数量增加的相当多。具体情况如下表：（附图表）
    而且，每年宿舍面积的增长速度，超过了职工人数的增加速度。1955年同1954年比较，职工人数增加了10％，宿舍面积增加了14％；1956年同1955年比较，职工人数增加了40％，宿舍面积增加了46％；1957年，职工人数不但没有增加，反而在逐步减少。但是，住房问题却是越来越紧张。调查时，全厂还有二百多户在吵着要房子。
    为什么工厂里尽了最大的力量来解决职工住房问题，但是仍旧不能满足职工的要求呢？
    职工家属进厂的太多
    调查中发现，大量职工家属涌到厂里来，是造成住房紧张的重要原因。
    这几年，家属户数增加的速度超过了职工人数增加的速度。1956年，职工总数比1955年增加了40％，家属户数却增加了56．16％；从绝对数来看，职工人数增加了一千三百五十一人，其中一千三百人是青年徒工，但是家属却增加了一千零七户。1957年，职工人数在逐步减少，但是家属却还在继续增加。1954年，全厂职工家属只有一千六百二十八户，1956年增加到二千八百户，1957年5月底又增加到二千九百零五户。
    很大一部分职工家属是在去年厂里进行工资改革和农村实现高级合作化以后到厂里来的。去年进厂的一些初中生，进厂后不几个月就晋为二级工，收入增加了，有爱人的就将爱人接来，没有爱人的也赶紧结婚。据不完全统计，从1956年9月到1957年6月，全厂有一百七十一对男女青年结婚，平均每一天半有一人结婚，相应地平均每一天半就要有人向工厂要一间房子。据1957年5月底的统计，四级以下的青年工人和学徒带家属的，占全厂工人家属总户数的57．29％。去年还有一些职工家属是因为对农业合作化和农村生活有错误认识而流入城市的。例如房产科职工黄必定的家属，原来在农村生产、生活得很好，但在1956年农村高级合作化以后，他们错误地认为土地已经归公，农村生活苦，于是全家搬进厂来。到厂以后，儿子找不到工作，到处去做临时工，儿媳妇也闲着没有事做，家中生活发生了困难，还要求工厂救济。
    大量家属住在厂里，生小孩也就特别多了。据初步统计，去年全厂职工生的小孩上八百个，平均每天两个多。
    住厂家属中，很多又是非直系亲属或非供养亲属。简直是九亲、六故，只要和职工有点瓜葛，就跑来住厂里的房子。据调查，1957年5月底在厂的二千九百零五户家属中，有四百三十三户带有非直系亲属，共五百三十人。详情如下表：（附图表）
    这些人当中，还没有包括为职工照管小孩和管理家务的非直系亲属。这些人里面只有一小部分是丧失劳动力或者没有生活依靠的，其余大部分都是青壮年，可以在农村参加劳动。
    在家属宿舍中，还有少数所谓“黑人”。他们多系职工的亲友，在农村有户籍，来也不带户口迁移证。住下来多则年把，少则数月。有的想找工作，有的做生意。
    这么多家属住到厂里来，房子问题自然就紧张了。
    许多职工的经济生活，因此也紧张起来了，有些甚至发生了困难。前面谈到的黄必定一家是一个例子。另外，像五级工张忠孝，原来家属在农村参加农业生产，他每月的工资除本人开支以外，还可以把一部分寄回老家，生活相当富裕；1956年下半年把家属五口接到厂里，儿子没有工作做，生活便发生了困难。张忠孝思想上苦闷，生产积极性也受到了影响。
    收费制度不合理
    调查中还发现，有些本来在当地有房子住的职工也向厂里要房子。原来在郊区的常住户有九百多家，据初步调查，其中有一百零八户已经把房子退了租或者转租出去，甚至有的把自己的房子租出去或者租给本厂，然后带着全家向工厂要房子。
    这是为什么呢？
    原因在于厂里的收费制度不合理。关于房租收费和水电等补助的情况，可从下面三个表中看出来。（附图表）
    注：水电费只补贴住工厂自有房屋的职工，对住民房的职工不予补贴。（附图表）
    另外，据对一千三百六十七户的调查，每户负担的房租在三角到九角的，共有一千一百一十四户，占81．49％；其余的也比社会上一般的房租低得多。就以1956年12月份工厂租的民房为例，工厂支付的房租费是四千二百八十一元，职工向工厂交的房租只是六百八十六元，相差五点二四倍。
    在这种情况下，许多本来在当地有房子住的职工自然就乐于另向厂里要房子了。甚至有的人还把自己的家具卖掉，再向工厂领家具用。
    有些调离工厂的职工，也因此迟迟不肯退房子。仅原属这个厂的合作社、子弟学校等单位的职工，在这些单位移交地方以后，长时期没有退房子的就有二十户，占用房屋四十多间。
    不合理的收费制度，加剧了房屋的紧张情况。
    不合理的收费制度，更使国家在经济上受到了损失。从1954年到1956年，这个厂付出的房租、修缮、水电补贴、家具用品等项费用，高达二十九万九千二百四十六元。这笔钱占这个厂三年利润总额的5．7％，等于这个厂三年企业奖励基金的75％。
