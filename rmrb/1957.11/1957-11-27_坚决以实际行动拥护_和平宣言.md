    Resolutely Support the "Peace Manifesto" with Practical Actions
    I am a demobilized soldier, and I deeply understand the disaster of war and the great significance of defending peace. In 1952, I took up a gun and went to Korea to fight the American imperialists to defend peace, protect our neighbors, and defend our motherland. On the Korean front, I witnessed the inhumane crimes of American imperialism with my own eyes. They bombed peaceful towns and villages in Korea into rubble, leaving Korean elders, children, and women lying in pools of blood... All these crimes aroused our unparalleled anger, and we severely attacked the enemy, forcing them to sign the armistice agreement and achieving the final great victory. The crimes of American imperialism in Korea are still fresh in my memory. In order to prevent the recurrence of imperialist aggression and defend peace, it is the duty of all good people in the world. For the sake of our happy life, we must resolutely oppose war and oppose the production and testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The "Peace Manifesto" issued by the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries demonstrates the strength of the peace and democratic camp and is a powerful weapon to stop war. I am determined to support this "Peace Manifesto" with practical actions. If the imperialists dare to launch a new war, I will return to the front line and crush their offensive.

    坚决以实际行动拥护“和平宣言”
    我是一个转业军人，我深深懂得战争的灾难和保卫和平的重大意义。1952年我曾拿起枪杆到朝鲜去，为了保卫和平、保卫邻邦和祖国，和美帝国主义战斗过。在朝鲜前线，我亲眼看到美帝国主义惨无人道的罪行，他们把朝鲜的和平城乡轰炸成为一片瓦砾，使朝鲜的老年人、儿童和妇女倒在血泊里……。这一切的罪行，激起了我们无比的愤怒，我们狠狠地打击敌人，迫使他们在停战书上签字，取得了最后的伟大胜利。美帝国主义在朝鲜的罪行，我现在仍记忆犹新。为了防止帝国主义的侵略罪行重演，保卫和平是世界上一切善良人民的职责。为了我们的幸福生活，我们必须坚决反对战争，反对生产和试验原子武器和氢武器。现在各国共产党和工人党发表的“和平宣言”表明了和平民主阵营力量的强大，是制止战争的有力武器。我决心以实际行动拥护这个“和平宣言”。如果帝国主义胆敢发动新的战争，我将重返前线，粉碎他们的进攻。
