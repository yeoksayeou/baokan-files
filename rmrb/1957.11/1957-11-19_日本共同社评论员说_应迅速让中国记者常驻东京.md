Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th -- Kyodo News commentator Shunsaku Ushijima published a commentary today stating that Japan should quickly allow Chinese journalists to reside in Tokyo.

Ushijima said that there are news reporters from various countries stationed in Tokyo, but not Chinese reporters. The obstacle causing this situation lies with Japan. He pointed out that the Japanese government's so-called argument that it cannot accept Chinese journalists residing in Japan because Japan and China have not restored diplomatic relations is untenable. Japan has not established diplomatic relations with South Korea, but South Korean journalists are already stationed in Tokyo.

The commentator pointed out that the exchange of journalists should be reciprocal. Japan and China should quickly exchange journalists with each other. Ushijima said that although Japan and China cannot quickly restore diplomatic relations, mutually dispatching resident journalists and exchanging news with each other is beneficial and harmless to enhancing friendly relations between the two countries. Japan and China have close relations in both politics and economics, and the mutual exchange of journalists is a natural requirement.

    日本共同社评论员说
    应迅速让中国记者常驻东京
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：共同社评论员牛岛俊作今天发表评论说，日本应该迅速让中国记者常驻东京。
    牛岛说，现在东京驻有各国的新闻记者，只是没有中国的记者。造成这种情况的障碍在日本方面。他指出，日本政府提出的所谓日中两国没有恢复邦交所以不能接受中国记者常驻日本的这种说法是讲不通的。日本同南朝鲜没有建立邦交，可是南朝鲜的新闻记者已经常驻在东京。
    这位评论员指出，交换记者应该是互惠的。日本和中国应该迅速互相交换记者。牛岛说，日中两国虽然还不能很快地恢复邦交，但是互相派遣常驻记者，互相交换消息，对于增进两国的友好关系有利无害。日中两国不论在政治上和经济上都有着密切的关系，互相交换记者是一个自然的要求。
