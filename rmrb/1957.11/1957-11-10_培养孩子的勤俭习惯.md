Cultivating Children's Habits of Thrift and Frugality
Professor Guan Ruiwu, Department of Education, Beijing Normal University

    We should all be thrifty and frugal, and we should also educate our children to develop habits of thrift and frugality from an early age. Some parents think that children are too young and neglect to educate them about thrift and frugality; other parents talk to their children about "saving," but fail to cultivate their habits of saving in real life. Below, I will discuss how to cultivate children's habits of thrift and frugality.

    Young children all like toys, and we can use toys to cultivate their habits of thrift and frugality. Every time we buy a toy for a child, we should teach them to cherish it. In the beginning, we should play with the child, showing great interest in the toy. After playing, teach the child to put it away in a certain place (for example, put a shelf in a corner of the room for them, or give them a soap box to store toys). We must always educate children to keep their toys clean, for example, teach children to wash the doll's clothes clean, and polish the wheels of the toy car. When toys are broken, we should also teach children to repair them. In this way, through the process of cherishing, organizing, and repairing, we can educate children to cherish items and develop the habit of thrift and frugality through hands-on work.

    Teaching children to use waste materials or natural objects to make toys can certainly save expenses, but more importantly, it cultivates children's labor habits and creativity. For example: glue used matchboxes together to make small furniture, make dolls with scraps of cloth; stick red leaves on paper to create beautiful patterns, and soak the roots of radishes or cabbages in water to make them sprout and bloom. When children don't know how to do it, we can try to do it for them, and teach the children to help; but we should gradually teach them to do it themselves, and encourage them to think of ways.

    Some parents feel that it is difficult to cultivate children's thrift and frugality through toys. They say, "When we buy toys for the children, they throw them around. We spend a lot of effort making toys for them, and they break and disassemble them in a short time." This view is incorrect. There are many reasons why children throw toys around. Sometimes it is because the parents' lives are disorganized and the things at home are cluttered; or they have not prepared a fixed place for the children to put their toys; and some parents buy too many toys for their children, which develops children's habit of favoring the new and disliking the old, and not cherishing items. Therefore, how to teach children to play is a matter worth paying attention to.

    In terms of children's eating habits, we can also carry out education on thrift and frugality. Some parents neglect to cultivate children's correct eating habits, which sows the seeds of waste from an early age. For example: some parents do not let their children eat on time, some parents allow their children to leave food uneaten, which gradually forms the children's habit of wasting food.

    We must correct these bad habits in time. The most important thing is: to have a certain time for meals; not to give snacks between meals; not to give children too much food each time, let them finish it and then add more; prepare a certain seat for the children when eating, and ask them to leave the seat after they have eaten it clean. In this way, fixing the time, place, and requirements, it is easy to make children develop good eating habits.

    Some people think that educating children needs to be carried out from big aspects, and these trivial matters of "eating and playing" are insignificant. In fact, it is precisely because we ignore these details in daily life that children develop many bad habits. If we want to cultivate children's habits of thrift and frugality, we must patiently and meticulously educate them in daily life.

### 培养孩子的勤俭习惯

    培养孩子的勤俭习惯
    北京师范大学教育系教授　关瑞梧
    我们每个人应当勤俭，也要教育孩子从小养成勤俭的习惯。有些父母认为孩子小，忽略对孩子进行勤俭教育；也有些父母虽然对孩子讲“节约”，但是没有在实际生活中培养孩子的节约习惯。下面我来谈谈怎样培养孩子养成勤俭习惯的问题。
    幼小的孩子都喜欢玩具，我们就可以利用玩具来培养孩子的勤俭习惯。每当我们给孩子买一件玩具的时候，就应当教孩子爱护它。开始的时候，我们要和孩子一起玩，表示对这个玩具有莫大的兴趣；玩完以后，教孩子收拾在一定的地方（例如给他们在屋子的一个角落放个架子，或者给他们一个肥皂箱装玩具）；随时要教育孩子保持玩具的整洁，例如教孩子把娃娃的衣服洗干净，把小车的轮子擦亮等；当玩具坏了，还要教孩子修补。这样从爱护、整理、修补的过程中，教育孩子爱护物品和动手做事的勤俭习惯。
    教孩子利用废物或自然物做玩具，这固然可以节省开支，更重要的是培养孩子的劳动习惯和创造性。例如：把用过的火柴盒粘起来做成小家具，用碎布做娃娃；把红叶贴在纸上摆成各种美丽的图案，把萝卜或白菜的根部泡在水里让它发芽开花。当孩子不会做的时候，我们可以试着给孩子做，教孩子帮帮忙；但是要逐渐教他们自己动手做，鼓励他们想办法。
    有些父母感到通过玩具来培养孩子勤俭有困难。他们说，“给孩子买了玩具，他们就乱扔，费了许多心思给他们做玩具，他们连折带拆，一会就搞坏了”。这种看法是不对的。孩子乱扔玩具的原因是多方面的，有时是由于父母的生活没有秩序，家里的东西杂乱无章；或者是没为孩子准备放置玩具的固定地方；还有些父母给孩子买的玩具太多，养成孩子喜新厌旧和不爱惜物品的习惯。所以，怎样教孩子去玩，是很值得注意的一件事。
    在孩子的饮食习惯方面，也可以进行勤俭的教育。有些父母忽视培养孩子正确的饮食习惯，使他们从小种下浪费的萌芽。例如：有些父母不让孩子按时进食，有些父母允许孩子剩下食物，这就逐渐形成了孩子浪费粮食的习惯。
    我们必须及时纠正这些坏习惯。最主要的是：吃饭要有一定的时间；两餐之间不给零食；每次给孩子食用的量不要太多，让他们吃完了再添；吃饭时给孩子准备一定的座位，要求他们吃干净了再离开座位。这样固定时间、地点和要求，很容易使孩子养成吃饭的好习惯。
    有人认为教育孩子需要从大的方面进行，这些“吃吃玩玩”的生活琐事是微不足道的。其实，正是由于忽视这些日常生活中的细节，才使孩子养成许多不良的习惯。我们要培养孩子的勤俭的习惯，必须从日常生活中，耐心细致地对孩子进行教育。
