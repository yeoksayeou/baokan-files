    Launch a Great Debate to Clarify Right and Wrong
    Wuhan First Cotton Mill Workers Discuss Lei Dagu's Forgetful Thought

    (Our Dispatch) The workers of the joint state-private Wuhan First Cotton Mill recently held a great debate centered on the forgetful thinking of female weaver Lei Dagu, which provided a profound and vivid socialist education for all the workers. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions have decided to use Lei Dagu's forgetful thinking as a typical example to organize debates among all workers in the province, in order to further raise the socialist consciousness of the province's workers and overcome the influence of bourgeois ideology.

    Lei Dagu is a female worker nearly forty years old. Her mother gave birth to nineteen children, seventeen of whom were taken by hunger, and one was sent to a nursery, leaving only Lei Dagu to be raised. Lei Dagu became a weaver in an official bureau at the age of sixteen for two years. In 1938, she lost her job and married an old long-term worker in the suburbs. In the five or six years after her marriage, the whole family ate pork only once and a pig's head once. She had to go to the fields to operate the waterwheel the day after giving birth. In the spring of 1944, because of three consecutive years of drought, Lei Dagu could not support her four children, so she went to her mother for help; her mother could not even take care of her own food and clothing, and the mother and daughter looked at each other and cried. In the thirty years of the old society, her children were tortured to death by poverty, and she herself had to find wealthy families to work as a maid to make a living. After liberation, the hardships of the past were gone forever. Lei Dagu entered the Wuhan First Cotton Mill as a worker. Because of her active work, the workers elected her as a worker representative, and later elected her to study at the Central China Workers' School. Her life has also undergone significant changes. She moved into a newly built workers' dormitory, furnished with cypress wood tables and chairs and a large glass cabinet. In summer, she wears silk, and in winter, she wears leather. She eats three or four dishes every day, including fish and meat. In such a good environment, instead of actively contributing to socialist construction, she began to pursue a bourgeois lifestyle: "Now that I have money, I want to be like the ladies of the old society, eat, dress, and enjoy myself." However, because she did not work hard to improve production, her technical level lagged far behind other workers. When the factory adjusted work quotas, her salary was reduced. She became dissatisfied, thinking that "it's not worth earning forty or fifty yuan a month for hard work," so she slacked off at work, and when the loom stopped, she didn't care. She envied the life of a small vegetable vendor across the street who "works less and earns more" and wanted to retire and go home to do business. Her aunt gave her 270 yuan to deposit and collect interest at a rate of five percent; she took the opportunity to raise the interest rate to eight percent to one percent, lending money at usurious rates among the workers. In more than two years, the principal and interest have snowballed to more than 500 yuan. Her neighbor, Zhang Huisheng, borrowed 50 yuan from her in 1954 and has paid her more than 100 yuan in interest over the past two years. Once, when Zhang Huisheng was a few days late in paying interest, she cursed him at Zhang's door for more than two hours. Later, when the trade union asked her to stop lending at usurious rates and repay the principal with no more interest, she desperately demanded high interest and attacked the new society. During the Great Leap Forward, she made many fallacious statements, such as: "The living standards of workers have declined after liberation." "Unified purchase and sale is 'suppressing people's food and clothing,'" and so on.

    After the rectification movement in Wuhan First Cotton Mill entered the stage of great debate, more than 6,000 workers throughout the factory held debate meetings to focus on Lei Dagu's forgetful thinking. Some old workers rebuked her, saying, "Lei Dagu, Lei Dagu, your family has suffered poverty for generations, how can you forget the pain once the wound is healed!" After talking about the difficult and impoverished situation of his family in the old society, the old worker Liu Jinglun said angrily, "Lei Dagu suffered as much as I did in the past, but she has now forgotten her roots, she really has no conscience!" Yang Suzhen, Liu Xiuying, Li Dagu, and others who have worked with Lei Dagu for many years, criticized Lei Dagu's various forgetful thoughts and wrong activities, and said: "Your thinking has gone astray under the erosion of capitalist exploitation and hedonistic thoughts. If you don't turn back this time, you will surely fall into an irrecoverable quagmire." Some workers also examined their own errors similar to Lei Dagu's. Since last year, Ma Zumin, a tinsmith in the mechanical workshop, has not been at ease with his work, and sometimes he works during the day and goes back to do private work at night, hoping to earn more money. After hearing the introduction about Lei Dagu's forgetful thinking, he did not sleep well for several nights, and the ideological struggle was very intense. Later, he talked about these things at the group meeting and promised to correct his mistakes.

    In this great debate, Lei Dagu herself was also educated. On the 19th, she said at the workers' meeting in the weaving workshop: "The Communist Party completely liberated me from the old hardships, but I am ungrateful and say bad things about the Party against my conscience, and attack the Party's policies. For personal enjoyment, I did not work hard and exploited my worker brothers with usury. I really hate myself for being so ignorant!" While saying this, she wept bitterly. She expressed that she would humbly listen to everyone's opinions, further examine herself deeply, and correct her mistakes. (Edited by Hubei Daily Editorial Department)

    开展大辩论弄清大是非
    武汉第一纱厂职工讨论雷大姑忘本思想
    本报讯　公私合营武汉第一纱厂最近围绕织布女工雷大姑的忘本思想进行大辩论，使全体职工受到了一次深刻生动的社会主义教育。中共湖北省委和湖北省工会决定以雷大姑的忘本思想为典型，组织全省职工进行辩论，以便使全省职工进一步提高社会主义觉悟，克服资产阶级思想的影响。
    雷大姑是一个年近四十岁的女工。她母亲生了十九个孩子，有十七个被饥饿夺去了生命，一个送进了育婴院，只有雷大姑一人被养大。雷大姑十六岁时就随母亲进官布局当了两年织布工人。1938年，她失业了，嫁给了郊区一个老长工。在婚后五、六年里，全家总共只吃了一顿猪肉和一个猪头。她头天生了孩子，第二天就得下田车水。1944年春天，因为接连三年天旱，雷大姑养不活四个孩子，便去投奔她母亲；她母亲也是连自己的吃穿都顾不上，母女相望失声痛哭。在旧社会三十年的岁月里，她的孩子被贫困折磨死了三个，她自己也是到处找有钱人家做女仆糊口。解放以后，旧日的苦难一去不复返了。雷大姑进了武汉第一纱厂当工人。因为她工作积极，工人选她做工人代表，后来又选她到华中工人学校学习。她的生活也有了显著的变化。她住进了新建的工人宿舍，房里摆的是柏木桌椅、大玻璃柜。夏天穿绸的，冬天穿皮的。她每天都吃三四个菜，有鱼也有肉。在这样好的环境下，她不是积极去为社会主义建设出力，却从此开始追求资产阶级的生活方式：“现在有钱了，要像旧社会的太太们那样，吃点，穿点，好好享受一下。”但是，因为她不努力钻研生产，技术水平远远落在别的工人后面了，当工厂调整工作定额时，她的工资降低了。她就心怀不满，认为“一月挣四五十元劳力伤神不划算”，于是在工作上吊儿浪当，布机停下来了，她也不管。她成天羡慕对门一个小菜贩“劳动少，赚钱多”的生活，想退休回家做生意。她姑母交给她二百七十元，要她代为放账，取息五厘；她趁机把利息提高为八厘至一分，在工人中放高利贷。两年多，这笔钱本息翻滚，已经成了五百多元。她的邻居张慧生1954年借了她五十元钱，两年来已经付给她一百多元利钱，有一次张慧生付利迟了几天，她就在张的门口大骂了两个多钟头。后来，工会要她停止放高利贷的活动，停息还本，她还拼命索取高利，并且攻击新社会。大鸣大放中，她发了许多谬论。如说：“解放后工人生活水平降低了。”“统购统销是‘压倒人吃，压倒人穿’”等等。
    武汉第一纱厂整风运动转入大辩论阶段以后，全厂六千多工人普遍举行辩论会，集中讨论了雷大姑的忘本思想。有的老工人责备她说：“雷大姑呀雷大姑，你们家祖祖辈辈都受穷，你怎么好了疮疤忘了疼！”老工人刘敬仑在谈了自己家里在旧社会艰难困苦的情况以后，气愤地说：“雷大姑过去和我一样受苦，但她现在忘了本，真是没良心！”同雷大姑一起工作多年的杨素珍、刘秀英、李大姑等，批判了雷大姑的各种忘本思想和错误活动，并且说：“你的思想在资本主义剥削思想和享乐思想侵蚀下，已经开了岔。要不在这次猛回头，一定会堕入不可收拾的泥坑。”有的工人也检查了自己类似雷大姑的错误思想。机械车间白铁工马祖民从去年以来，就不安心工作，有时还白天上班，晚上回去干私活，想多赚点钱。当他听到关于雷大姑忘本思想的介绍以后，一连几夜没有睡好觉，思想斗争很激烈。后来，他在小组会上谈出这些事情，保证改正错误。
    在这次大辩论中，雷大姑本人也受到了教育。19日，她在布场工人大会上说：“共产党使我完全脱离了旧时的苦境，我却忘恩负义，昧着良心说党不好，攻击党的政策。我为了个人享受，不好好劳动，用高利贷剥削自己工人兄弟。我真恨自己太不觉悟！”一面说着，一面痛哭流涕。她表示要虚心听取大家的意见，进一步深刻检讨，改正错误。　（湖北日报编辑部）
