Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 1st: Nearly one million people in Shanghai have joined the nationwide rectification movement. More than a thousand units that have launched the rectification movement have begun to gradually enter the third stage, focusing on rectifying work styles and improving work. This was announced by Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the preparatory meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Party Congress held today.

In his report at today's meeting, Ke Qingshi said that this Party Congress will focus on discussing rectification and improvement issues in Shanghai's rectification movement. He said that the entire process of the rectification movement has two slogans: "Letting Go" and "Rectification." At present, most leading cadres are determined to "Let Go." However, there are still many problems with boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly rectifying. There are roughly three situations regarding rectification: First, a small number of people are afraid of rectifying. This is particularly evident in the struggle against the rightists. Some have not handled it well, and in order to oppose the rightists, they deny the shortcomings and errors that do exist in our work, even portraying themselves as perfect saints. Ke Qingshi said that another situation is that most units have problems with formalism in rectification. A factory's masses raised opinions hoping that the leadership would pay attention to the advanced experience of other units and asked to visit and learn from advanced units. The reply made by the factory in the meticulously arranged "Rectify While Correcting" column was: "Consider, consider, when necessary and under possible conditions." Here comes another case of bureaucracy! In some units, the masses put forward thousands or tens of thousands of opinions to the leaders, but our leaders casually issued a notice, saying "Opinions received, I will definitely change." This is just a greeting to those who raised the opinions. This is not serious rectification, but bureaucratic and formalistic rectification. Ke Qingshi then spoke of the third situation, saying that many units have indeed seriously corrected some things, which is good. But this is piecemeal rectification, without finding the root of the problem. This kind of rectification is not enough. For example, some people criticize us for being divorced from the masses, and our leaders go to the workshop to talk to the masses, without further considering the reasons for the leadership being divorced from the masses, without considering improving it fundamentally from our work methods, work styles, organizational systems, etc. Piecemeal rectification is not acceptable; it will not be rectified well.

Ke Qingshi pointed out that many ideological problems in rectification must be resolved. He said that rectification is to improve the work of the entire Party. From the perspective of the entire Party, the leading cadres must first rectify themselves. If the leading cadres are rectified, they can drive the work and style of the entire Party. We cannot think that after the great blooming and contending and the anti-rightist struggle, the rectification movement is over, and the rectification and improvement can be muddled through. Rectification is first and foremost to rectify the leadership itself, not to rectify others.

Ke Qingshi pointed out that rectification must grasp the key issues. We must rectify the work style of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. Since liberation, bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism within our Party have grown. What is more prominent is that many rules and regulations are unreasonable, unrealistic, and mutually contradictory. Secondly, leading cadres have serious work styles that are divorced from reality and divorced from the masses. Responsible cadres are busy with affairs, and they do not touch many important matters themselves. The bureau chief gives it to the section chief, the section chief gives it to the division chief, and the division chief gives it to the staff member. For many important issues, leading cadres must touch it themselves. There are many meetings now, precisely because leading cadres do not understand the situation, and are not clear about things in their minds. Therefore, meetings must be held for everything, no matter how big or small. This set of work methods must be changed. Ke Qingshi said that many cadres are arrogant, complacent, and self-righteous, do not follow the mass line, and do not consult with the masses when encountering problems. Some Party members pursue personal enjoyment, care about fame and status, and a few are even corrupt and degenerate. These phenomena must be resolutely corrected. Not only must we improve our work style to do a better job, but more importantly, we must improve our ideological level, exercise our ideological awareness well, and use our energy to do our best to do our work well.

Ke Qingshi finally talked about the issue of cadres participating in physical labor. He pointed out that this is the fundamental system of our country. He called on everyone to advocate a hard-working and simple style, and leading cadres should be close to the lower levels and close to the masses. Some cadres should also prepare to go to the countryside, factories, and schools for training.

Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, conveyed the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the meeting. This Party Congress will, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, summarize the work of rectification and anti-rightists in Shanghai in the previous period, and will focus on discussing the issue of rectifying work style and improving work, and further carry out the rectification movement.

More than 700 formal representatives and more than 600 non-voting delegates, including cadres at the municipal and district levels and some grassroots cadres, attended the meeting.

Prior to this, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a plenary meeting, conveyed and discussed the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and made a decision to convene this Party Congress.

### 批判领导干部在整改中的错误思想

    柯庆施同志在上海市党代表会议上作报告
    批判领导干部在整改中的错误思想
    对于怕改和形式主义的整改，必须坚决反对；就事论事的改是不够的，应该抓住关键问题
    新华社上海1日电　上海市已有近百万人民投入了全民性整风运动。开展整风运动的一千多个单位，开始陆续转入以整顿作风、改进工作为主的第三阶段。这是中共上海市委员会第一书记柯庆施在今天举行的中共上海市党代表会议的预备会上宣布的。
    柯庆施在今天的会上所作的报告中说，这次党代表会议将着重讨论上海整风运动中的整改问题。他说，整风运动的全部过程有两个口号，一是放，一是改。目前一般领导干部，放的决心都有了。但是要大胆、坚决、彻底的改，问题还很多。对于整改大致有三种情况：一种情况是有少数人怕改。特别表现在反右派斗争中，有的掌握得不好，为了反右派，就否认了我们工作中确实存在的缺点和错误，甚至把自己说成是完美无缺的圣人。柯庆施说，另外一种情况是，大多数单位的整改有形式主义的毛病。有个工厂的群众提出意见希望领导上重视其他单位的先进经验，要求到先进单位去参观、学习。这个厂在布置得很讲究的边整边改栏里所作的答复是：“在必要的时候，在可能的条件下，考虑，考虑。”又来了一个官僚主义！有的单位，群众对领导提了几千几万条意见，我们的领导却轻松地发了一个通知，表示“意见收到了，我一定改。”这只不过是对提意见的人打声招呼罢了，这不是认真地整改，是官僚主义、形式主义的整改。柯庆施接着谈到第三种情况说，有不少单位的确已认真地改了一些，这是好的。但这是就事论事的改，没有找到问题的根本所在，这样改是不够的。比如有人批评我们脱离群众，我们的领导人就下车间去，和群众谈谈心，再没有进一步考虑造成领导脱离群众的原因在那里，没有从我们的工作方法、工作作风、组织制度等等方面加以考虑，从根本上来加以改进。就事论事的改是不行的，改不好的。
    柯庆施指出，整改中的许多思想问题必须解决。他说，整改要改进整个党的工作，从整个党来说，首先是领导干部要改。领导干部改了，就能把整个党的工作和作风带动起来。不能认为经过大鸣大放和反右派，整风运动就完了，整改就可以混过去了。整改首先是要整领导自己，而不是整人家。
    柯庆施指出，整改必须抓住关键问题。要整脱离群众、脱离实际的作风。解放以来，我们党内的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义是滋长了。表现比较突出的是许多规章制度不合理、不切实际，互相矛盾。其次，领导干部存在着严重的脱离实际、脱离群众的工作作风。负责干部忙于事务，许多重要的事情自己不去摸，局长交给处长，处长交给科长，科长交给科员。对于许多重要问题，领导干部一定要自己去摸。现在的会多，就是因为领导干部不了解情况，心中无数，因此事无大小都要开会，这一套工作方法一定要改变。柯庆施说，不少干部骄傲自满，自以为是，不走群众路线，遇事不与群众商量，有一部分党员追求个人享受，计较名誉地位，个别的甚至腐化堕落。这些现象必须坚决改掉。不但要改进作风，使工作做得更好，更重要的是要把思想水平提高，把思想意识锻炼好，把我们的精力用在千方百计把工作做好上面。
    柯庆施最后还谈到干部参加体力劳动的问题，他指出这是我们国家的根本制度。他号召大家提倡艰苦朴素的作风，领导干部要接近下层、接近群众。有的干部还要准备到农村、工厂、学校去锻炼。
    中共上海市委员会书记处书记陈丕显在会上传达了中共八届三中全会的精神。这次党代表会议将根据三中全会的精神总结上海前一时期整风和反右派的工作，并将着重讨论整顿作风、改进工作的问题，进一步开展整风运动。
    出席这次会议的有正式代表七百多人，列席代表有市、区两级干部和部分基层干部六百多人。
    在这以前，中共上海市委员会举行了全体会议，传达和讨论了中共八届三中全会的精神，并作出了召开这次党代表会议的决定。
