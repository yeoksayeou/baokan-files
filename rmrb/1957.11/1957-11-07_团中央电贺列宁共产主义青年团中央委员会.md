Xinhua News Agency, November 6th -- The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China sent a telegram on November 4th to the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, congratulating them on the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. The telegram is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, dear comrades:

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we, on behalf of all the members of the Communist Youth League of China and all the Chinese youth, extend to you – our dearest comrades and elder brothers – and through you, to all the members of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League and all the Soviet youth, our warmest festive greetings.

The great October Revolution opened a new era in human history, opening the path to complete liberation for the working people and oppressed nations of the world. The offspring of the October Revolution – the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union – under the leadership and education of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has educated the entire Soviet youth generation with communist thought, and has established countless meritorious deeds for the cause of socialism and communism, becoming a model for all communist youth organizations in the world. The Chinese youth, under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party, clearly recognize that the revolutionary and construction undertakings we are engaged in today are a continuation of the great October Revolution. The great Soviet Union will always be our example to learn from.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people, through forty years of arduous struggle, have achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements in the economic, cultural, scientific, and technological fields. These achievements have made the imperialists tremble with fear and panic. The Chinese youth deeply know that the victory of our country's revolution and construction, and the emergence, consolidation, and strength of the socialist camp worldwide, are inseparable from the existence of a strong Soviet Union. The Chinese youth regard consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union with all their strength as their most lofty and sacred internationalist duty.

The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is built on the common ideal of communism and the common thought of Marxism-Leninism, and is unbreakable. Whether in the years of our revolutionary struggle to overthrow reactionary rule, or today in our socialist revolution and socialist construction, the Soviet people have given us great and selfless assistance in all aspects. The Chinese youth deeply understand the great significance of the eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and will spare no effort to continuously consolidate and develop the great friendship between the people and youth of China and the Soviet Union.

Dear comrades: Let us jointly raise the banner of socialism-communism even higher, and continue to advance along the great road of the October Revolution, until the final victory!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people and youth of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the great October Revolution!

Long live the great Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!

Long live Marxism-Leninism!

Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China

    团中央电贺列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会
    新华社6日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会4日致电苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会，祝贺十月革命四十周年。电文如下：苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    在这伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念日来临之际，我们代表全中国的共青团员和全中国青年，向你们——我们最亲爱的同志和老大哥，并通过你们，向全苏联的共青团员和全苏联青年，致以最热烈的节日的祝贺。
    伟大的十月革命开辟了人类历史的新时代，开辟了全世界劳动人民和被压迫民族获得彻底解放的道路。十月革命的产儿——苏联列宁共产主义青年团，在苏联共产党的领导和教养下，以共产主义的思想教育全苏联的青年一代，为社会主义、共产主义的事业建立了无数的功勋，成为全世界一切共产主义青年组织的榜样。在中国共产党教导下的中国青年，明确的认识到，我们今天所进行的革命与建设事业，是伟大十月革命的继续。伟大的苏联永远是我们学习的榜样。
    苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，经过四十年的艰苦奋斗，已经在经济、文化、科学、技术等各方面获得了史无前例的辉煌成就。这些成就，已经使帝国主义胆战心惊、恐慌万状。中国青年深深地知道，我国革命和建设事业的胜利，全世界社会主义阵营的出现、巩固和强大，都是和强大苏联的存在分不开的。中国青年把全力巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结看作是自己最崇高最神圣的国际主义的义务。
    中苏友谊是建立在共产主义的共同理想和马克思列宁主义的共同思想的基础之上的，是牢不可破的。无论在我国进行推翻反动统治的革命斗争的年代里，无论在我国从事社会主义革命与社会主义建设的今天，苏联人民都从各方面给我们以伟大的无私的援助。中国青年深深了解中苏两国永恒友谊的伟大意义，并将不遗余力地为不断巩固与发展中苏两国人民和青年间的伟大友谊而努力。
    亲爱的同志们：让我们共同更高地举起社会主义——共产主义的旗帜，沿着十月革命的伟大道路，继续前进，直到最后的胜利！
    中苏两国人民和青年间永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    伟大的十月革命万岁！
    伟大的苏联人民和苏联共产党万岁！
    马克思列宁主义万岁！
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会
              1957年11月4日
