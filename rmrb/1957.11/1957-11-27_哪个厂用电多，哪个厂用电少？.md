    Which Factory Uses More Electricity, Which Factory Uses Less?
    According to the 1956 electricity consumption statistics of large enterprises: Among the nine electric furnace steelmaking enterprises in Fushun, Dalian, Benxi, Taiyuan, Tangshan, Yasaiya, Daye, Chongqing No. 2 Factory, and Kunming, the lowest electricity consumption per ton of steel was at Tangshan Steel Plant, using 617 kWh, and the highest was at Kunming Steel Plant, using 1108 kWh, a difference of nearly double. The electricity consumption per ton of steel in electric furnace steelmaking affiliated with the machinery industry is even greater. For example, a repair shop under the Second Ministry of Machine Building consumes 1700 kWh per ton of steel, more than one and a half times that of Tangshan Steel Plant.
    Among various textile factories producing 21-count yarn on cones, the lowest electricity consumption per piece of yarn was at Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill, at 142 kWh; the highest was at Southwest No. 601 Factory, at 219 kWh per piece of yarn, a difference of 54%.
    The electricity consumption for producing pozzolanic 400-grade cement in various cement plants is lower at Fushun Cement Plant, at 75 kWh per ton, and higher at Dalian Cement Plant, at 95 kWh per ton, a difference of 26%.
    The production methods for these products are basically the same, but the electricity consumption varies greatly. Factories with high electricity consumption should learn from advanced experiences and strive to catch up.

    哪个厂用电多，哪个厂用电少？
    据1956年大型企业用电统计资料：抚顺、大连、本溪、太原、唐山、亚细亚、大冶、重庆二厂和昆明等九个电炉炼钢企业中，每炼一吨钢的用电量最低的是唐山钢厂，用电六百一十七度，最高的是昆明钢厂，用电一千一百零八度，相差将近一倍。机械工业附属的电炉炼每吨钢的用电量更大，如第二机械工业部一个修理厂，每吨钢用电一千七百度，比唐山钢厂多一倍半以上。
    各纺织厂生产二十一支筒子纱，用电量最低的是上海国棉二厂，每件纱一百四十二度；最高的是西南六○一厂，每件纱二百一十九度，相差54％。
    各水泥厂生产火山灰质400号水泥的用电量，低的是抚顺水泥厂每吨七十五度，高的是大连水泥厂，每吨九十五度，相差26％。
    这些产品的生产方法基本上是一样的，但用电量悬殊很大，用电多的工厂应当学习先进经验，努力赶上去。
