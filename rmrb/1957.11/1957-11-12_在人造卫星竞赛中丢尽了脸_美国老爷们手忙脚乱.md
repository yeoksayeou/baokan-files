Xinhua News Agency, November 11th, Washington Dispatch: The American ruling class continues to frantically search for various "methods" in an attempt to remedy its failure in the artificial Earth satellite race.

　　The Senate is scheduled to hold missile-satellite hearings in late November, which will investigate the situation where the United States lags behind the Soviet Union in missiles and satellites, as revealed by the Soviet Union's launching of satellites.

　　Senator Kennedy demanded that Eisenhower tell the people the "complete and cold facts," believing that the United States is by no means only behind the Soviet Union in rockets, as the government claims.

　　Hynek, Deputy Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and head of the U.S. satellite observation program, called for a change in science education, starting from kindergarten. He believes that the United States is rapidly becoming a second-rate scientific power, and the United States can only change the current scientific backwardness by overhauling its overall science education.

　　Eisenhower's senior science advisor, Rabi, suggested that the government should give college scholarships of $500 to all high school students who pass the federally administered math test. He said this would help overcome the "big mistake of not valuing science."

　　Some newspapers and politicians have called for strengthening missile research programs. Senator Butler even called on the government to appoint former Far East U.S. Commander General Douglas MacArthur to "lead a unified missile rocket command." Senator Kefauver criticized Eisenhower's approach of adding a special assistant for science and technology as insufficient, saying: "What we need is not a private advisor, we need to add a cabinet position—a Minister of Science."

    在人造卫星竞赛中丢尽了脸
    美国老爷们手忙脚乱
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国的统治阶层继续在忙乱地寻找各种“办法”，企图来补救它在人造地球卫星竞赛中的失败。
    参议院定在11月下旬举行导弹—卫星意见听取会，这个会将调查由于苏联发射卫星而显示出来的美国在导弹—卫星方面落后于苏联的情况。
    参议员肯奈迪要求艾森豪威尔把“全面冷酷的事实”告诉人民，他认为美国决不像政府所说的只是在火箭方面落后于苏联。
    史密森氏天体物理实验室副主任、美国卫星观察计划负责人海内克要求改变一直从幼稚园开始的科学教育。他认为，美国正在迅速沦为第二流的科学强国，美国只有刷新全盘的科学教育，才能改变目前的科学落后情况。
    艾森豪威尔高级科学顾问拉比建议凡是参加联邦举办的数学测验及格的高中学生，政府都应当给以五百美元的大学奖学金。他说，这会有助于克服“不重视科学的大错误”。
    一些报纸和政界人士要求加强导弹研究计划。参议员巴特勒甚至要求政府任命前远东美军总司令道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟来“领导一个导弹火箭统一司令部”。参议员克弗维尔批评艾森豪威尔增设一个科学和技术特别助理的做法是不够的，他说：“我们所需要的不是一位私人顾问，我们需要增设一个阁员职位——一位科学部长。”
