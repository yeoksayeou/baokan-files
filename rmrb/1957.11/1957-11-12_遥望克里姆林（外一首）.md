    Looking Afar at the Kremlin (and another poem)
    Guo Huang
    I stand in Beijing in October,
    Looking afar at the Kremlin's red star,
    Through the green trees' fountains and the red clouds of flags,
    The red star shines brightly, all aglow...
    This light is like my father's stern smile,
    And also like my mother's loving eyes,
    It has comforted so many sufferers,
    And awakened so many sleepers in the world.
    I raise both hands to embrace this rising flame,
    Falling into my arms is a childhood-like, beautiful dream,
    Tears of joy turn into solemn thoughts:
    Labor, fight, forever follow her victorious advance!

    These Batches of Steel Wheels
    These batches of steel wheels are from our fraternal ally, the Soviet Union!
    The shimmering luster is like the smile of a loved one,
    The rounded shape fans forth gusts of heroic spirit...
    These steel wheels are Moscow's exchange goods,
    Bringing us happy dreams,
    Three hundred million hearts are fused into these steel wheels,
    Making them exceptionally strong and worthy of cherishing.
    They will be installed on ships to break through the waves,
    Installed on train carriages to cross mountain peaks,
    They will carry us and our motherland,
    Accelerating on rainbow-like avenues....

    遥望克里姆林（外一首）
    郭煌我站在十月的北京，遥望克里姆林红星，透过绿树的喷泉和旗帜的红云，红星闪闪发光，一片通明……这光芒像爸爸严峻的笑容，又好像妈妈慈爱的眼睛，它曾给多少苦难者以抚慰啊，又把世界上多少沉睡者唤醒。我高举双手去拥抱这升腾的光焰，落到怀里的是童年般绚丽的梦境，喜悦的热泪化成了庄严的思想：劳动、战斗，永远跟着她胜利前进！
    这一批批钢轮这一批批钢轮是来自盟邦苏联哟，闪灼的光泽好像亲人的笑容，浑圆的形体扑扇着阵阵雄风……。这钢轮是莫斯科的交换品，为我们运来了幸福的美梦，钢轮上融进了三万万颗心，使得它分外坚固、值得珍重。它将安装在舰船上去冲破波涛，安装在车盘上去跨越山峰，它将载着我们和我们的祖国，在彩虹般的大道上加速滚动……。
