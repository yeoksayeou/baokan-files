    A Province-Wide Upsurge in Water Conservancy Construction
    Xinhua News Agency Report:  On the basis of exceeding the water conservancy construction targets of the First Five-Year Plan, farmers in Heilongjiang Province have launched a mass upsurge to comprehensively develop water conservancy.
    Currently, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have put forward slogans such as "Seeking grain from the water" and "Turning low-lying land into fertile fields." Everywhere, whether in mountainous areas or plains, one can see crowds engaged in water conservancy construction. According to statistics from half of the province's counties, the number of people involved in water conservancy construction has reached 100,000, and the amount of earthwork completed has exceeded one million cubic meters. The earthwork project of the Sifengshan Reservoir being built in the suburbs of Jiamusi City is nearing completion. It will irrigate more than 1,000 hectares of paddy fields and raise one million fish.
    The benefits that farmers in Heilongjiang Province have gained from developing water conservancy construction are increasing year by year. Over the past five years, the province has built and repaired more than 2,800 kilometers of flood control dikes and 3,500 kilometers of drainage canals along the river, which have withstood three major floods in recent years, ensuring the safety of cities and villages along the river and the harvest of farmland. At the same time, thanks to planned soil and water conservation work and the construction of flood control projects, 240,000 hectares of farmland were protected from flooding this year, despite the rainfall being higher and the floods being greater than last year. In particular, the construction of more than 5,000 large and small irrigation projects has resulted in the emergence of paddy fields in every county of this province, which originally had very few paddy fields, and paddy fields have even developed to Sunwu County at 50 degrees north latitude. The province's paddy fields have increased from 120,000 hectares in 1953 to 250,000 hectares, and the increase in paddy fields is equivalent to the total development of paddy fields in the past 40 years, increasing grain production for the country. Now, the relevant departments of the province are drafting a comprehensive plan in this regard. According to preliminary plans, 1.25 million hectares of paddy fields will be developed within ten years, which can increase grain production by 4 million to 5 million tons per year, equivalent to increasing the yield per mu of existing cultivated land by 100 jin. The elimination of waterlogging and the reduction of soil erosion can increase grain production by about 1.5 million tons.
    Jilin Province
    More than 200 Water Conservancy Projects Have Been Completed
    This newspaper reports: An upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction has initially taken shape in Jilin Province. Every day, tens of thousands of farmers brave the morning mist and the cold wind of the night to participate in the work intensely. According to statistics from 19 cities and counties at the end of October alone, 260 reservoirs, ponds, and river dams have been completed, which can irrigate more than 3,600 hectares of paddy fields; more than 560 reservoirs and ponds are under construction, there are more than 130 river dams, and there are also many mechanical pumping stations and small ponds. After these projects are completed, they can irrigate more than 10,000 hectares of paddy fields.
    Recently, various counties in Jilin Province have generally held water conservancy work conferences, criticized various negative emotions and conservative ideas, and revised the 1958 paddy field development plan. At the meeting of district party committee secretaries and township general branch secretaries held in Panshi County, some cadres revealed serious negative and conservative ideas. In response to these situations, the Panshi County Committee of the Communist Party of China comprehensively summarized the huge role of water conservancy construction in agricultural production over the past few years, and mobilized the masses to calculate four accounts: first, calculate the water source account; second, calculate the land account; third, calculate the labor account; and fourth, calculate the amount of engineering work. After the accounting, the confidence of the cadres in realizing the water conservancy construction plan was boosted. The Dongliao County Party Committee powerfully criticized conservative ideas through a three-level cadre meeting and in-depth investigation and detailed accounting, so that the county's plan to develop paddy fields next year reached more than 11,700 hectares, more than twice the original plan (3,500 hectares).
    Xinjiang
    Large-Scale Water Conservancy Construction in Northern and Southern Tianshan Mountains
    This newspaper dispatches from Urumqi: An upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction is unfolding in the northern and southern Tianshan Mountains. The Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture has more than 100 small-scale water conservancy projects under construction by the masses this winter, and 11 water conservancy projects jointly built by the people and the government. Agricultural cooperatives in Yining, Zhaosu, Bole and other places proposed: "Water conservancy construction does not require state investment, and the collective strength of the cooperative can solve it. As long as the government sends technicians to guide it." After the water conservancy projects being built this winter are completed, in addition to ensuring the water use of 5.67 million mu of cultivated land in the entire prefecture, the irrigation area can also be expanded by 200,000 mu. The joint meeting of county party committee secretaries and county heads held in Hotan Prefecture made plans for agricultural production next year, and decided to complete 19 medium and small-scale water conservancy projects from this winter to next year, accumulate 100 million bags of fertilizer, and ensure that the sown area will increase by 300,000 mu next year, and the total grain output will increase by 21% compared with this year. The water conservancy work conference held in Kashgar Prefecture decided to build and expand 17 water conservancy projects from this winter to next year. Farmland irrigation in Kashgar Prefecture mainly relies on snow water from the Pamir Plateau and the Kunlun Mountains. Every spring, when water is needed, the accumulated snow does not melt, and the river flow is very small, which cannot meet the needs, seriously affecting spring sowing. In July and August, the accumulated snow melts, but the water is wasted in large quantities. These 17 water conservancy projects can block and store the water of several major rivers in the entire prefecture, which can expand the irrigation area by more than 640,000 mu and improve the irrigation area by more than 360,000 mu. It is estimated that it can increase grain production by more than 100 million jin.
    Gansu Province
    Large-Scale Dike Construction and Land Reclamation on Both Banks of the Bailong River
    Xinhua News Agency Report: Farmers on both banks of the Bailong River in Gansu Province are engaged in a struggle to "seize land from the river." Within the 120-kilometer range of Gansu's Dangchang, Wudu and Wenxian counties through which the river flows, agricultural cooperatives along the banks will build dikes to reclaim more than 9,000 mu of land this winter and next spring, basically reclaiming the good farmland along the river that has been destroyed.
    About 80,000 people live along this section of the Bailong River. Although the climate here is mild and rice can be harvested twice a year, many villages along the river cannot be self-sufficient in grain harvest because the Bailong River has the harm of "thirty years in Hebei, thirty years in Henan." Therefore, they want to "seize land from the river" with a determined and unyielding spirit.
    Now, a wave of dike construction and land reclamation has been set off among the vast number of farmers along the river. More than 30 dangerous beaches have been fully started within the 100-kilometer range of Dang, Wu and Wen counties.
    There are a total of 43 major projects that can be used to build dikes and reclaim land within the 120 kilometers of the Bailong River flowing through Dang, Wu, and Wen counties, including 10 river interception projects. Through these years of efforts, nearly 20,000 mu of good farmland have now been reclaimed. A total of more than 30,000 mu of land can be reclaimed along the Bailong River. If calculated according to a yield of 400 jin per mu, the more than 80,000 people on this section of the riverbank can earn 150 jin of grain per person per year from the newly reclaimed land.
        *Yunnan Province*
    Raise Funds Locally According to Local Conditions
    Xinhua News Agency Report: The mass winter water conservancy work in Yunnan Province has started ahead of schedule. At present, Qujing, Yuxi, Wenshan, Zhaotong, Chuxiong, Simao and other regions and Honghe Hani Autonomous Prefecture, Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, and Kunming suburban areas, where the autumn harvest has basically ended, have started one or two months earlier. Large numbers of laborers have been organized to invest in water conservancy construction in various places.
    Since Yunnan's leading departments at all levels conveyed and studied the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), they have further overcome conservative ideas and re-revised the water conservancy construction plan for this winter and next spring. Qujing Prefecture has increased the irrigated area from 300,000 mu planned for the first time to more than 464,400 mu; Simao Prefecture originally planned to expand the irrigated area by more than 114,400 mu, and now plans to strive to exceed 200,000 mu. The irrigated area planned to be expanded in Kunming's suburbs this winter and next spring is more than the sum of the past five years. In planning, various places can generally adapt to local conditions according to the local natural conditions. Mountainous areas mainly focus on building small-scale water conservancy projects, while dam areas mainly focus on building medium-sized water conservancy projects.
    After fully discussing the relationship between water conservancy and increased production, and "public assistance to the people" in the socialist debate in various rural areas, the broad masses not only broke with negative and conservative emotions, but also tried to find ways to build water conservancy projects. Weishan County, which believed last year that it could not find any water conservancy project targets, plans to build 388 medium and small-scale water conservancy projects this winter and next spring after discussions and surveys by the masses. After discussions and accounting, the investment problems of water conservancy projects in Qiubei, Yuxi, Jiangchuan and other counties this winter and next spring can all be solved by raising funds from local funds and the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives. The various townships in Qilu County also independently or jointly raised funds to build medium-sized water conservancy projects.
    In October, leading departments in various places successively established special agencies to lead the mass water conservancy work. Most counties designated the county party committee secretary or county head to be personally responsible. At the same time, they trained a large number of water conservancy technicians and organized experienced technical cadres to go to the countryside for guidance. Supply and marketing departments in various places also promptly supplied the materials and equipment needed for water conservancy projects. Provincial and various special and county-level agency cadres are also going to the countryside in batches to help agricultural cooperatives carry out water conservancy construction.

    与河争地　向水索粮
    发动群众  大兴水利
    黑龙江
    全省掀起兴修水利高潮
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省农民在超额完成第一个五年计划水利建设指标的基础上，又掀起了群众性的全面发展水利事业的高潮。
    目前各地农业社纷纷提出：“向水索取粮食”、“洼地变良田”的口号。不论山区、平原到处可以看见兴修水利的人群，据全省半数县的统计，兴修水利的人数已达十万，完成土方量一百余万公方。佳木斯市郊修筑的四丰山水库的土方工程即将完成，它将灌溉一千多公顷水田，养一百万尾鱼。
    黑龙江省农民由于发展水利建设而获得的利益，一年比一年大。全省五年来在沿江修建和补修的二千八百多公里的防洪大堤和三千五百多公里的排涝水渠，战胜了近年来三次大洪水，保证了沿江城市、农村的安全和农田的收成。同时由于有计划的进行了水土保持工作和修建了防涝工程，在今年雨量比去年多，洪水比去年大的情况下，保证了二十四万公顷农田免遭涝灾。特别是由于建设了五千余处大、小型各种灌溉工程，使这个原来稻田很少的省份，县县出现了稻田，而且稻田一直发展到北纬五十度的孙吴县。全省稻田从1953年的十二万公顷发展到二十五万公顷，增加水田的数字相当于过去四十年发展水田的总和，为国家增产了大量的粮食。现在省有关部门正在拟定有关这方面的全面规划。根据初步计划：十年内发展水田一百二十五万公顷，每年即可增产粮食四百万到五百万吨，等于现有耕地面积每亩提高产量一百斤。而消除内涝和减少水土流失两项，又可增产粮食一百五十万吨左右。
    吉林省
    已经完成二百多项水利工程
    本报讯　吉林省兴修农田水利高潮已经初步形成。每天都有成千上万的农民，冒着晨雾和深夜的寒风，紧张地参加工作。仅据十九个市县在10月末的统计，峻工的水库塘坝、拦河坝等工程已有二百六十多座，可灌溉水田三千六百多公顷；正在动工的水库塘坝五百六十多座，拦河坝有一百三十多处，另有机械抽水站、小型塘坝多起。这些工程完成后，可灌溉一万多公顷水田。
    最近吉林省各县普遍召开了水利工作会议，批判了各种消极情绪和保守思想，修订了1958年水田开改计划。在磐石县召开区委书记和乡总支书记会议上，有些干部暴露出严重的消极保守思想。中共磐石县委针对这些情况，全面地总结了几年来水利建设对农业增产的巨大作用，并且发动群众算四笔账：一算水源账；二算土地账；三算劳动力账；四算工程量账。经过算账，鼓舞起干部实现水利建设计划的信心。东辽县委通过三级干部会议和深入摸底算细账的办法，有力地批判了保守思想，使全县明年开改水田计划达到一万一千七百多公顷，超过原计划（三千五百公顷）的两倍多。
    新疆
    天山南北大兴水利
    本报乌鲁木齐电　兴修农田水利的高潮正在天山南北展开。伊犁哈萨克自治州今年冬季群众兴修的小型水利工程有一百余项，民办公助的水利工程有十一项。伊宁、昭苏、博乐等地农业社提出：“兴修水利不要国家投资，社的集体力量可以解决，只要政府派技术人员来指导就行了。”今年冬季兴修的水利工程完工以后，除保证全州五百六十七万亩耕地的用水外，还可扩大灌溉面积二十万亩。和阗专区召开的县委书记、县长联席会议，对明年农业生产作了规划，决定从今年冬季到明年，完成十九项中、小型水利工程，积肥造肥一亿口袋，保证明年增加播种面积三十万亩，粮食总产量要比今年增加21％。喀什专区召开的水利工作会议，决定从今年冬季到明年，兴建和扩建十七项水利工程。喀什专区农田灌溉主要靠帕米尔高原和昆仑山的雪水，每年春季需水时，积雪不化，河水流量很小，不能满足需要，严重影响春播，到7、8月，积雪融化，水却大量浪费。这十七项水利工程可把全专区几条主要河流的水拦蓄起来，可扩大灌溉面积六十四万余亩，改善灌溉面积三十六万多亩，估计可增产粮食一亿多万斤。
    甘肃省
    白龙江两岸大量筑堤淤地
    据新华社讯　甘肃境内白龙江两岸的农民，正在进行“与河水争地”的斗争。这条江水流过的甘肃宕昌、武都和文县一百二十公里范围内，沿岸各农业社今冬明春将筑堤淤地九千多亩，基本上把这一地区内沿江被冲毁的良田争取过来。
    白龙江这一段沿岸住着约八万多人，虽然这里气候温和，稻子一年可以两熟，但因白龙江有“三十年河北、三十年河南”的移动之害，许多沿江村庄粮食收获不能自给。因此，他们以坚毅不屈的精神要“与河水争地”。
    现在沿江广大农民已掀起了筑堤淤地的浪潮，在宕、武、文三县一百多公里范围内，有三十多处险滩已经全面动工。
    白龙江流过的宕、武、文三县一百二十公里内，可以筑堤淤地的较大工程共四十三处，其中截河工程十处。经过这些年的努力，现在已经淤出近二万亩良田。白龙江沿岸共可淤出三万多亩地，如果按亩产四百斤计算，这一段江岸八万多人口，每年每人可以从新淤出的土地上收入一百五十斤粮食。
        ＊云南省＊
    因地制宜自筹经费
    新华社讯　云南省群众性的冬季兴修水利工作，已经提前开始。目前秋收已经基本结束的曲靖、玉溪、文山、昭通、楚雄、思茅等专区和红河哈尼族自治州、大理白族自治州以及昆明市郊区，已经提前一两个月开始，各地组织了大批劳动力投入水利建设。
      云南各级领导部门，自传达、学习了三中全会文件和全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）后，进一步克服了保守思想，重新修订今冬明春水利建设的计划，曲靖专区已由第一次规划的扩大灌溉面积三十万亩增加到四十六万四千多亩；思茅专区原来计划扩大灌溉面积十一万四千多亩，现在计划争取超过二十万亩。昆明市郊今冬明春计划扩大的灌溉面积，比以往五年的总和还多。各地在规划中，一般都能根据当地的自然条件因地制宜，山区都以兴修小型水利为主，坝区以兴修中型水利为主。
    各地农村在社会主义大辩论中，对水利和增产的关系、“民办公助”等问题进行了充分的讨论后，广大群众不仅打破了消极保守情绪，还设法寻找兴修水利的窍门。去年认为找不到水利工程对象的巍山县，经过群众的辩论和查勘，今冬明春计划修筑的中、小型水利工程就有三百八十八处。丘北、玉溪、江川等县今冬明春兴修水利工程的投资问题，经过讨论、算账，全部可由地方经费和农业社的公共积累中筹集解决，杞麓县的各个乡，也自筹经费单独或联合兴修中型水利。
    各地领导部门，在10月份就先后设立了专门机构领导群众性的兴修水利工作，大多数县指定了县委书记或县长亲自负责，同时训练了大批水利技术人员，组织有经验的技术干部下乡巡回指导。各地供销部门也及时供应了水利工程所需的物资和器材。省级和各专、县的机关干部，也正分批下乡帮助农业社进行水利建设。
