Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 17th. The literary and art circles of Zhejiang Province have held dozens of debate conferences in succession over the past two months to expose and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of Huang Yuan, alternate member of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, deputy director of the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department, director of the Provincial Cultural Bureau, and secretary of the Party Group of the Cultural Bureau.

Many people revealed at the meeting that Huang Yuan has always been hostile to the Party's leadership over literary and art undertakings, peddled bourgeois literary and art viewpoints, and tampered with the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. For example, at last year's theater and troupe allocation meeting, he openly advocated that troupe performances should be "well-matched" and "descend layer by layer." What he meant was that troupes with higher artistic levels and large troupes should perform in big cities and not go to factories and rural areas; serving workers and peasants was the business of troupes with lower artistic levels and small troupes. The Ministry of Culture of the Central Government instructed mass cultural work institutions to send one-third to one-half of their staff to factories and rural areas, but Huang Yuan believed that this policy was wrong and wanted the cadres of the Social Culture Section of the Cultural Bureau to use two-thirds of their strength to engage in creation. He said, "What can be achieved by doing organizational work?" Huang Yuan looked down on singing materials that cooperated with the publicity of political tasks, often dismissing them with one blow under the pretext of "low artistic quality." Under the influence of Huang Yuan's literary and artistic ideology, some troupes were unwilling to perform in factories and rural areas; the "Mass Singing" publication was suspended; and many county cultural centers changed direction, with cultural workers not going to the countryside or factories, but shutting themselves up to create, running large publications, and publishing a lot of disgusting poisonous weeds that flaunted individuals, no longer acting as propagandists and mobilizers. Huang Yuan opposed the principle of improving on the basis of popularization and correctly combining improvement with popularization, but instead of opposing serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposing popularization, and never mentioning the ideological transformation of writers, he engaged in empty talk about improvement and creation, guiding literary and artistic creation in the bourgeois direction of pursuing personal fame and gain.

In recent years, Huang Yuan has been dissatisfied with the Party and has developed to the point of opposing the Party. Since he came to Zhejiang in 1955, he has completely negated the achievements of Zhejiang's literary and art work over the past few years, saying that the Provincial Party Committee "neither values nor understands" literature and art. The so-called "Lion Dance Lantern Incident" that occurred in March last year was deliberately created by Huang Yuan and Chen Shouchuan, deputy director of the Provincial Cultural Bureau. At that time, the Provincial Party Committee criticized the folk song and dance troupe for not cooperating with the publicity of the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program, which was a tendency to deviate from politics, and this tendency existed throughout the Provincial Cultural Bureau; but Huang Yuan not only did not accept it, but also attacked the correct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee in the name of opposing "dogmatism," and disbanded the Provincial Folk Song and Dance Troupe and posted slogans on the lion dance lanterns, and then publicized everywhere that the Provincial Party Committee had ordered the disbandment, and even published articles fabricating facts through Wenhui Daily in an attempt to frame the Provincial Party Committee and oppose the Party's leadership over literary and art undertakings. Especially during the period of great blooming and contending, he stood with the rightists and launched vicious attacks on the Party. In May of this year, Huang Yuan claimed to be a "Hundred Flowers Blooming" faction at a forum in literary and art circles presided over by rightist leader Song Yunbin; he insisted that he had been "squeezed out by the dogmatism" of the Provincial Party Committee for several years, and even cried on the spot. Afterwards, Huang Yuan condoned the rightist Zheng Boyong, secretary-general of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, to publish a large number of articles attacking the Party in the "East Sea" monthly magazine. He also took advantage of the opportunity for cadres of the Cultural Bureau to go boating on the lake to instigate them to attack the Provincial Party Committee, and slandered the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee as "leading today's literature and art with the leadership methods of the propaganda chief of the liberated area" and as "dogmatists." Also in May of this year, at the Provincial Cultural Administration Conference, Huang Yuan also took advantage of the issue of the separation of cultural work and education work to start a fire. Huang Yuan originally disagreed with the separation of culture and education, but he incited representatives from various places to say: "If the Provincial Party Committee does not solve the issue of the separation of culture and education at this meeting, I will take the lead in taking to the streets." He also threatened other comrades: "Are you going or not?"

At the debate conference, it was also revealed that Huang Yuan is an extreme individualist. He often preached the "one" principle to literary and art workers. He said: To become famous, one must perform a good play, play a good tune, and write a good script. After the Kunqu Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" became famous throughout the country, Huang Yuan used "Fifteen Strings of Cash" as his capital to boast about himself. When the Zhejiang Yue Opera Troupe was preparing to perform in Beijing, he asked the troupe to stop performing for several months to practice a repertoire behind closed doors, so that the repertoire would be "a blockbuster." Later, seeing that the rehearsals did not meet his expectations, Huang Yuan lost his temper and said: "I, the director, am going to jump into West Lake," and resolutely refused the troupe to go to Beijing. Huang Yuan guided people to pursue fame and fortune by breaking away from the masses and reality.

In order to exclude the Party's leadership in the literary and art field, Huang Yuan has formed an anti-Party clique in Zhejiang's literary and art circles in recent years. The main members of this clique, in addition to Huang Yuan himself, include Zheng Boyong, Chen Xuechao, Chen Shouchuan, Cao Xiangqu, and Wang Canru. They once manipulated the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the "East Sea" editorial department, and used these two fronts to launch crazy attacks on the Party. In addition, Huang Yuan also collected and reused more than a dozen rightists and counter-revolutionaries who shared his views, and some were even placed in leadership positions in literary and art departments. He drove away Lu Jiazhen, the Party member leader of the Zhejiang Yue Opera Troupe, but appointed the rightist Yao Shuijuan and the expelled bad element Ren Xianzhang as the leader and deputy leader. He also shielded the counter-revolutionary element Chen Jing, not allowing him to participate in the anti-suppression movement, but asking him to specifically sort out scripts. When the script was written, Huang Yuan patted Chen Jing on the shoulder and said: "Old brother, old brother, you have made a great contribution!" and said: "Without Chen Jing, the Yue Opera Troupe would have nothing to eat in the second half of the year!"

After these two months of exposure and debate, Huang Yuan's true colors have been completely exposed. In the face of a large number of facts, he had to lower his head and confess his guilt.

### 浙江文艺界举行数十次辩论会  彻底揭穿黄源反党面目

    浙江文艺界举行数十次辩论会
    彻底揭穿黄源反党面目
    新华社杭州17日电　浙江省文艺界在最近两个月内连续举行了数十次辩论大会，揭露和批驳了中共浙江省委候补委员、省委宣传部副部长兼浙江省文化局局长、文化局党组书记黄源的反党反社会主义言行。
    很多人在会上揭露，黄源一贯敌视党对文艺事业的领导，贩卖资产阶级的文艺观点，篡改了文艺为工农兵服务的方向。如在去年剧场、剧团调配会议上，他公开提倡剧团演出要“门当户对”、“层层下降”，其意思就是艺术水平较高的剧团和大剧团要在大城市演出，不要到工厂和农村里去；为工人和农民服务是艺术水平较低的剧团和小剧团的事。中央文化部指示群众文化工作机构要以三分之一到二分之一的力量下厂下乡，黄源认为这个方针不对，要文化局社会文化科的干部用三分之二的力量去搞创作，他说“搞组织工作能搞出什么名堂？”黄源看不起配合宣传政治任务的演唱材料，往往以“文艺性不高”为理由，一棍子打死。在黄源的这种文艺思想影响下，有些剧团不愿下厂下乡演出；“大众演唱”刊物停了刊；许多县的文化馆改变了方向，文化工作者不下乡，不下厂，关起门来创作，办大型刊物，刊载了很多令人恶心的标榜个人的毒草，不再去作宣传员和鼓动员。黄源反对在普及的基础上提高和把提高与普及正确结合的方针，却以反对为工农兵服务、反对普及和绝口不谈作家的思想改造去空谈提高，空谈创作，把文艺创作引导到追求个人名利的资产阶级方向。
    近几年来，黄源一直是对党不满的，并且发展到反党的地步。从他在1955年到浙江后，就一口否定浙江几年来的文艺工作的成绩，说省委对文艺“既不重视又外行”，去年3月发生的所谓
  “狮子龙灯事件”，就是黄源和省文化局副局长陈守川有意制造的，当时省委批评民间歌舞团不配合宣传全国农业发展纲要四十条是脱离政治的倾向，这种倾向在整个省文化局都存在；但黄源不但不接受，还以反对“教条主义”之名，攻击省委的正确领导，并且解散省民间歌舞团和在狮子龙灯上面贴标语，然后到处宣传说是省委下命令解散的，甚至通过文汇报发表捏造事实的文章，企图嫁祸于省委，反掉党对文艺事业的领导。特别到了大鸣大放时期，他和右派分子站在一起，对党进行了恶毒的攻击。今年5月间，黄源在右派头目宋云彬主持的文艺界座谈会上自称是“百花齐放派”；他硬说自己几年来受到了省委的“教条主义的排挤”，并且当场哭了一场。以后，黄源纵容右派分子、省文联秘书长郑伯永在“东海”月刊上大量发表攻击党的文章。他还利用文化局机关干部划船游湖的机会，在湖上煽动他们向省委进攻，并诬蔑省委负责同志是“以解放区宣传科长的领导方法来领导今天的文艺”，是“教条主义者”。也是今年5月，在全省文化行政会议上，黄源还利用文化工作和教育工作分科的问题放了火。文教分科原是黄源所不同意的，但他煽动各地代表说：“如果这次会议省委不解决文教分科的问题，我要带头上街。”他还威胁别的同志：“你们去不去？”
    在辩论大会上还揭露了黄源是一个极端的个人主义者，他常常向文艺工作者宣传“一个”主义的论调。他说：要出名，就要演好一出戏，吹响一支曲子，写好一个剧本。昆曲“十五贯”闻名全国后，黄源更以“十五贯”作为吹嘘自己的资本，当浙江越剧团准备到北京演出时，他曾叫剧团停演好几个月，来关门排练一个剧目，务使这个剧目达到“一鸣惊人”；后来看见排得不合他的意，黄源发脾气说：“我这个部长要去跳西湖，”坚决不许剧团到北京去。黄源就是这样引导人们脱离群众、脱离实际地去追逐名利。
    黄源为了要在文艺领域排除党的领导，他这几年来在浙江文艺界已经形成一个反党小集团。这个小集团的主要成员除黄源自己外，还有郑伯永、陈学昭、陈守川、曹湘渠、王参如等。他们曾经操纵了省文联和“东海”编辑部，并利用这两个阵地向党疯狂进攻。另外，黄源还搜罗和重用了十多个与他气味相投的右派分子和反革命分子，有些还被安插到文艺部门的领导岗位上。他赶走了浙江越剧团的党员团长吕家振，却委任右派分子姚水娟和已开除党籍的坏分子任贤璋为正副团长。他还包庇反革命分子陈静，不要他参加肃反运动，却叫他专门整理剧本，等到剧本写好，黄源拍着陈静的肩膀说：“老兄，老兄，你的功劳不小呀！”并说：“没有陈静，越剧团下半年没有饭吃！”
    经过这两个月的揭露和辩论，黄源的真面目已彻底暴露。他本人在大量事实面前只好低头认罪。
