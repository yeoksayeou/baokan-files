Soviet dispatches

    Beijing - Moscow
    Written collectively by our Moscow correspondents
    On November 2nd, Chairman Mao Zedong flew from Beijing to Moscow. Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, and all members of the Chinese delegation who came to attend the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, were warmly welcomed by the leaders of the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union and representatives from all walks of life.
    When the Soviet delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev visited our country in 1954, they invited Chairman Mao to visit the Soviet Union for the second time. When Chairman Voroshilov visited our country in May this year, he again invited Chairman Mao to visit the Soviet Union at a time he deemed appropriate. After the news of Chairman Mao's acceptance of this invitation was announced, the Soviet people eagerly looked forward to seeing Chairman Mao. Everywhere in the Soviet Union, people were asking us about this matter. When we visited the Shemakha State Farm in the ancient Azerbaijani city and bid farewell to the farm's director, he wrote a sentence in our diary: "I want to see Mao Zedong." Many Soviet friends we met were speculating about when the "appropriate time" would be for Chairman Mao to visit the Soviet Union. Some people guessed that Chairman Mao would definitely come to the Soviet Union during the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.
    Their guess was correct. On the evening of October 26, the Soviet people heard from the radio broadcast that Chairman Mao, at the invitation of the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the CPSU, would lead a delegation to Moscow. These days, when meeting Soviet friends, they always say to you first: "Comrade Mao Zedong is coming soon."
    These days in Moscow, one can see that with the high tide of welcoming the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is constantly strengthening. On the evening of October 29, a grand inaugural meeting of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association was held in the brilliantly lit Tchaikovsky Conservatory. Many of the initiators and members of the presidium of this association, as well as the Soviets who attended the inaugural meeting, were old friends who had been to China and were familiar to the Chinese people. Their speeches at the meeting expressed their deep friendship with the Chinese people. The female chairman of the "Twelfth Anniversary of the October Revolution" Collective Farm in Kostroma Oblast, Kalinina, who had been to China, said enthusiastically that she wanted to go to China again. She loves the Chinese people, and the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is higher than the mountains and deeper than the sea.
    Now, the day the Soviet people have been looking forward to has arrived.
    At a little after 11:00 AM on November 2 (Irkutsk time), a "Tu-104" silver swallow brought Chairman Mao and all members of the delegation from Beijing to Irkutsk. Soviet Ambassador to our country, Yudin, also accompanied them. At the Irkutsk airport, the national flags of the Soviet Union and China were hung, along with the slogan "Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship Between the People of the Soviet Union and China." When this silver swallow landed at the airport, people came forward to greet them: Posypelov, alternate member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, who had come from Moscow in advance to wait for the reception; Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fedrin; Deputy Minister of the CPSU Central Committee Milosnichenko; Soviet Army General Gurasov; and Director of the Far East Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gudev. Delegate member, our ambassador to the Soviet Union, Liu Xiao, also came from Moscow to greet them. Local party and government responsible personnel headed by Shevtinin, First Secretary of the Irkutsk Oblast Committee of the CPSU, also came to the airport to greet them. Chairman Mao got off the plane, shook hands with the welcoming representatives one by one, and waved to the welcoming masses around the airport, then got back on the plane.
    After a short rest, this silver swallow soared again to an altitude of more than 10,000 meters, flying steadily westward under the sun-drenched blue sky, above the seemingly boundless white plain of clouds. Three hours later, this silver swallow had reached Omsk. The delegation was similarly welcomed by local party and government responsible personnel headed by Korotsensky, Secretary of the Omsk Oblast Committee of the CPSU. After refueling the plane, it continued to travel through the white clouds towards its destination. Three hours later, the silver swallow landed in Moscow. This was exactly 3:20 PM local time (8:20 PM Beijing time). When the silver swallow circled to a low altitude, the crisscrossing buildings on the ground could be clearly seen from the plane's porthole. The Kremlin was as solemn as ever, and the Moscow University buildings on Lenin Hills, and other tall buildings were clearly visible. Moscow had arrived. The capital of the great Soviet Union, which all the working people and people of peace in the world yearned for, had arrived.
    Today is a rare good day in the Moscow winter, and the sun is particularly bright. Before 3:00 PM, Vnukovo Airport had already gathered five to six hundred representatives from all walks of life in Moscow who had come to welcome the delegation, as well as foreign envoys, personnel from our embassy in the Soviet Union, and representatives of our students studying in the Soviet Union. After 3:00 PM, President Ho Chi Minh, who had just arrived in Moscow yesterday, came. Then Soviet party and government leaders Voroshilov, Khrushchev, Bulganin, Mikoyan, Suslov, Kuusinen, Furtseva, and Chairman of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, Andreyev, and other comrades also arrived at the airport. When the plane taxied to the front of the welcoming crowd, enthusiastic applause immediately rang out at the airport. As soon as the plane stopped, Chairman Mao appeared at the plane's porthole. He wore a brown hat and a gray coat, and looked energetic. As soon as he got off the plane, he immediately shook hands warmly with Comrades Voroshilov, Khrushchev, and Bulganin. Then, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling and other delegation members also got off the plane. Furtseva helped Soong Ching Ling walk towards the welcoming crowd. When Voroshilov shook hands with Chairman Mao, he said enthusiastically: "We meet again." This reminded people of the cordial meeting between these two leaders of China and the Soviet Union half a year ago. At this time, a group of Soviet elementary school students ran over to present flowers to the Chinese delegation. Badbelev, a student from Moscow No. 135 Elementary School, presented a bouquet of bright chrysanthemums to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao took the flowers, smiled, and shook his hand, saying, "Thank you." The child said happily to others: "We came very early. I am really happy that it was my turn to present flowers to Chairman Mao today." After the solemn national anthems of the Soviet Union and China were played, Chairman Mao, accompanied by Chairman Voroshilov, reviewed the Soviet guard of honor and met with the people welcoming them at the airport. Chairman Mao shook hands and greeted the welcoming Soviet ministers, generals, and foreign envoys. He walked to the front of our students studying abroad, and the students enthusiastically shouted, "Hello, Chairman Mao!" When Chairman Mao returned to stand with the representatives, the Soviet guard of honor formed a formation and marched solemnly past Chairman Mao and the delegation members, paying their respects to them. Then, Chairman Mao spoke in front of the loudspeaker. He said, "The people of our two countries have formed a fraternal alliance in a common struggle. No force in the world can separate us." "We will always stand together and fight for world peace and the victory of our common cause." He spoke the words in the hearts of the eight hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union, which aroused warm applause.
    After Chairman Mao finished speaking, several cars with small Chinese and Soviet national flags drove to the front of the delegation. Chairman Mao was invited into the first car, accompanied by Comrades Voroshilov and Khrushchev, and left the airport in the enthusiastic applause of the welcomers, heading towards the city of Moscow.

    北京——莫斯科
    本报驻莫斯科记者集体采写
    11月2日，毛泽东主席从北京飞到了莫斯科。毛泽东主席、宋庆龄副委员长和前来参加十月革命四十周年庆祝典礼的中国代表团全体团员，受到了苏联共产党和政府的领导人员以及各界代表人物的热忱的欢迎。
    1954年以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联代表团访问我国的时候，曾经邀请毛主席第二次访问苏联。今年5月伏罗希洛夫主席访问我国的时候，又邀请毛主席在他认为适当的时候访问苏联。当毛泽东主席接受这个邀请的消息公布以后，苏联人民就迫不及待地盼望着看到毛主席。在苏联各地，到处都有人向我们打听这件事。在我们访问阿塞拜疆古都谢马哈国营农场同这个农场的场长分别的时候，他在我们的日记本上写上了一句话：“我想看到毛泽东。”我们碰到的许多苏联朋友，他们都在猜想什么时候是毛主席访问苏联的“适当的时候”，有的人猜想毛主席在十月革命四十周年的时候一定会来到苏联。
    他们猜得不错。10月26日晚上，苏联人民从无线电广播中听到了毛主席应苏联政府和苏共中央的邀请，将要率领代表团前来莫斯科的消息。这些天，当碰到苏联朋友的时候，他们总是首先对你说：“毛泽东同志快要来了”。
    这些天在莫斯科可以看到随着迎接十月革命四十周年的高潮，中苏人民的深厚友谊又在不断加强。10月29日晚上，在灯光辉煌的柴可夫斯基音乐学院的大厅里举行了盛大的苏中友好协会成立大会。这个协会的发起人和主席团委员以及参加成立大会的苏联人中，有很多都是曾经到过中国，为中国人所熟识的老朋友。他们在会上的讲话都表达了对中国人民的深情厚谊，卡斯特罗马州“十月革命十二周年”集体农庄女主席卡列林娜曾经到过中国，她热情地说，她还想再去中国，她热爱中国人民，苏中人民友谊比山还高，比海还深。
    现在，苏联人民盼望已久的日子到来了。
    2日上午十一点多钟（伊尔库次克时间）一只“图—一○四”银色的燕子把毛主席和代表团全体团员从北京带到了伊尔库次克。苏联驻我国大使尤金也陪同飞来。伊尔库次克机场上挂着苏中两国国旗和“苏中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁”的标语。当这只银燕降落在机场的时候，人们迎接上去：有预先从莫斯科来到边境等候迎接的苏共中央主席团候补委员、苏共中央书记波斯伯洛夫、苏联外交部副部长费德林、苏共中央副部长米洛司尼青科、苏军大将古拉索夫、苏联外交部远东司司长顾德夫。代表团团员、我国驻苏大使刘晓也从莫斯科到这里来迎接。到机场迎接的还有以苏共伊尔库次克州委第一书记谢季宁为首的地方党政负责人员。毛主席下了飞机，和欢迎的代表们一一握手，并向机场周围的欢迎群众招手致意，然后又上了飞机。
    略事休息之后，这只银燕又腾上一万多公尺的高空，在阳光照耀的蓝天底下，在一望无际的白色平原似的云海上端，安稳地向西方飞行。过了三个钟头，这只银燕已达鄂木斯克。代表团同样受到了以苏共鄂木斯克州委书记科鲁森斯基为首的地方党政负责人员的欢迎。飞机添过油后，继续穿过白茫茫的云层向目的地进发。又过三个钟头，银燕在莫斯科降落了。这正是当地时间三点二十分（即北京时间下午八时二十分）。当银燕盘旋到低空的时候，从飞机舱口可以清楚地了望到地面上的纵横的建筑物。克里姆林宫庄严如旧，列宁山上的莫斯科大学校舍等等一座一座的高楼，历历在目。莫斯科到了。全世界劳动人民和和平人士所向往的伟大苏联的首都到了。
    今天是莫斯科冬天里稀有的好天气，阳光特别灿烂。下午三点钟前，伏努科夫机场已经聚集了前来欢迎的莫斯科各界代表人物、各国使节、我国驻苏大使馆人员和我国留苏学生代表等五、六百人。三点钟过后，昨天刚到莫斯科的胡志明主席来了。接着苏联党政领导人员伏罗希洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁、米高扬、苏斯洛夫、库西宁、福尔采娃和苏中友好协会主席安德列耶夫等同志，也来到了机场。当飞机滑行到欢迎的人群前面，机场上立刻响起一片热烈的掌声。飞机刚刚停下，毛主席就出现在飞机舱口。他头戴着褐色礼帽，身穿着灰色大衣，精神奕奕。他一下飞机就立刻同伏罗希洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁等同志热烈握手。接着，宋庆龄副委员长和其他团员们也下了飞机。福尔采娃扶着宋庆龄向欢迎的人群走去。伏老在同毛主席握手的时候，热情地说：“我们又见面了。”这使人想起了半年以前这两位中苏两国的领导人亲切会见的情景。这时，一群苏联小学生跑来向中国代表团献花，莫斯科一三五小学学生巴德别列夫把一束鲜艳的菊花献到毛主席手里。毛主席接过花笑着握了他的手说：“谢谢你。”这个孩子高兴地对人说：“我们很早就来了。今天能轮到我向毛主席献花，真高兴极了。”在奏过苏中两国庄严的国歌之后，毛主席由伏罗希洛夫主席陪同检阅了苏联仪仗队，又和在机场欢迎的人们见了面。毛主席同欢迎的苏联部长们、将军们、各国使节们握手问好。他走到我国留学生面前，学生们热情地高呼，“毛主席，你好！”在毛主席回来同代表们站在一起的时候，苏联仪仗队又排成了分列式，雄赳赳地走过毛主席和代表团团员的面前，向他们致敬。接着，毛主席在扩音机前讲了话。他说，“我们两国人民已经在共同的斗争中结成了兄弟般的同盟。世界上没有任何力量可以把我们分开。”“我们将永远站在一起，为着世界和平和我们共同事业的胜利而奋斗。”他说出了中苏两国八亿人民心坎里的话，引起了人们热烈的掌声。
    毛主席讲完话，几辆插着小幅中苏国旗的轿车开到代表团的面前，毛主席被请上了第一辆车，由伏罗希洛夫和赫鲁晓夫同志陪同，在欢迎者的热烈掌声中离开了飞机场，向莫斯科城里驶去。
