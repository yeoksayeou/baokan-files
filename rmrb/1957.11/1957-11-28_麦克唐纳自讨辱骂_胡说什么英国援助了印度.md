Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 27th: The Indian "Free Press" warned the British High Commissioner to India, Macdonald, that it would be best to be more cautious when making speeches in India. It also said: "The statement that Britain is constantly providing 'large amounts' of aid to India is economic nonsense."

This was in response to Macdonald's speech at the Bombay Rotary Club on November 12th. Macdonald had insisted that Britain had provided "aid" to India.

The "Free Press" pointed out on November 14th that "trade is not aid; trade is an economic need of two countries to satisfy each other, and the degree of satisfaction depends on many factors, namely geographic, economic, political and historical factors." Therefore, Macdonald's high-profile statement "will sound harsh to Indian ears."

It also said: "Britain's ruthless exploitation of this country for about two hundred years has been bad enough, and to utter such rhetoric as 'the white man's burden' to Indians today is inviting insults."

    麦克唐纳自讨辱骂
    胡说什么英国援助了印度
    据新华社新德里27日电　印度“自由新闻”警告英国驻印度高级专员麦克唐纳说，在印度发表谈话时最好要谨慎些。它还说：“说英国正在不断地向印度提供‘大量的’援助这种说法是经济上的胡说八道”。
    这是针对麦克唐纳11月12日在孟买扶轮社的谈话而发的。麦克唐纳曾经硬说英国对印度提供了“援助”。
      “自由新闻”11月14日指出，“贸易并不是援助；贸易是两个国家互相得到满足的一种经济需要，其满足的程度取决于许多因素，即地理、经济、政治和历史的因素。”因此，麦克唐纳的高调“在印度人听来将是刺耳的”。
    它还说：“英国无情地剥削这个国家约有二百年，这已经是够坏的了，而今天再对印度人发出这种类似‘白种人的负担’的论调，那是自讨辱骂。”
