Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 21st: Another American-made F-86 jet fighter crashed and burned in the Japanese Air Force today. As a result, the Japanese Air Force has ordered a two-day grounding to thoroughly inspect the jet aircraft supplied to it by the United States.

The aircraft caught fire and fell into the sea near the Hamamatsu base during a training flight. Japanese Air Force authorities suspect that the accident was related to the aircraft's fuel tanks. The Japanese Air Force authorities discovered during an inspection that 28 out of 228 F-86 jets could not take off due to fuel tank malfunctions.

This crash is the twentieth such incident this year. Thirty-eight air force personnel have died in these accidents. Shocked by the series of aircraft crashes, Japanese Air Force pilots once decided in June of this year to refuse to fly American-made jets.

    美制喷气飞机常失事  日空军人员死亡惨重
    据新华社21日讯　东京消息：今天日本空军中又有一架美国制造的F—86型喷气式战斗机失事烧毁。日本空军已经因此命令停止飞行两天，彻底检查美国供给日本空军的喷气式飞机。
    这架飞机在靠近滨松基地的海面上作训练飞行的时候突然起火堕入海中。日本空军当局怀疑这次失事和飞机的燃料桶有关。日本空军当局曾经在一次检查中发现，在二百二十八架F—86型喷气机中有二十八架因燃料桶机能失灵而不能起飞。
    这次飞行失事已经是今年以来的第二十次。在这些事故中已经有三十八名空军人员死亡。日本空军飞行人员在接连发生毁机事故的震惊下，曾经一度在今年6月决定拒绝驾驶美国造的喷气机。
