    In Rectification, Grasp the Key Link of Streamlining Institutions
    Jilin Province to Transfer 100,000 Cadres
    (Our newspaper, Changchun, November 18th, reporter Chen Ji) The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, from the 12th to the 14th, successively held meetings of the Standing Committee and an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee. In accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the meetings discussed the situation and problems of the rectification movement in the province and determined a plan for streamlining institutions and transferring cadres throughout the province. It was required that from now until April of next year, the province would successively transfer approximately 100,000 cadres (including those from state-owned enterprises and universities) to participate in productive labor and grassroots work.
    The meeting held that the anti-rightist struggle in the province has basically achieved a decisive victory. A large number of rightists have been refuted, and the masses' awareness has been greatly raised. Among the 640-plus units participating in the rectification movement, some have successively entered the stage of focusing on rectification. Approximately half of the units under the direct control of the provincial government that launched the rectification movement in the first batch have already transitioned or are transitioning to the stage of focusing on rectification. Due to the uneven development of the rectification movement, some units are still at the height of the anti-rightist struggle, and a few units have not yet deeply launched the anti-rightist struggle. These units must continue their efforts to thoroughly excavate and struggle against rightists, and must not end the battle hastily. However, the current focus of leadership should be on guiding the movement to transition to the stage of focusing on rectification, batch by batch, on the basis of the victory of the anti-rightist struggle. The main content of the rectification is: to examine problems in the implementation of the central authorities' guidelines and policies, especially problems related to socialist transformation and socialist construction, and to the development of industrial and agricultural production, and to earnestly improve leadership work; to examine the relationship between leaders and the masses, rectify the leadership style, streamline institutions, transfer cadres, change unreasonable regulations in the system and organization, and overcome tendencies towards bureaucracy, sectarianism, and special privileges; to examine problems in the implementation of ethnic policies, overcome Han chauvinism and local nationalism, and enhance ethnic unity.
    The meeting pointed out that rectification work and the counterattack against rightists are of equal importance, and neither aspect should be neglected. The key to doing a good job in rectification lies in the leadership's determination to firmly believe in the majority of the masses and to continue to mobilize the masses to speak out freely and fully. At present, some leading cadres do not fully recognize the important significance of rectification work. Some of them have shortcomings themselves and are afraid of getting burned, even using the anti-rightist struggle as an excuse to cover up their shortcomings; some do not believe in the majority of the masses, worrying that rightists will take the opportunity to counterattack during the rectification; or they are satisfied with the achievements of the previous stage of rectification while correcting errors, and do not have the ideological preparation to further rely on the masses to solve some fundamental and major problems. The meeting criticized these incorrect views, and required leaders at all levels to grasp rectification work, use the democratic forms of speaking out freely, fully, and debating extensively, and use the pressure and wisdom of the masses to improve work and correct shortcomings.
    In rectification work, it is necessary to grasp the key link of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres. With the development of the socialist cause, the province had expanded its staffing and established more institutions, which was necessary at the time. However, due to a lack of experience and strict control, some institutions have developed too large, with overlapping levels and overstaffing. There are too many cadres in the Party and government leading organs, most of whom have not been tempered by severe class struggle and productive labor, and lack experience in grassroots work. Among the cadres in provincial-level Party and government organs, approximately 70% or more have never worked at the grassroots level. Administrative management personnel in the province's public institutions account for 44.4% of the total number of employees. Management personnel in local state-owned enterprises account for 27.8% of the total number of employees. There are also too many management personnel in state-owned enterprises. This phenomenon of excessive non-production personnel and bloated institutions not only wastes the state's human and financial resources, but also promotes the development of bureaucracy and subjectivism, which is detrimental to the training and growth of cadres. The meeting required that the transfer of cadres from Party and government leading organs above the county level should account for approximately 28% of the actual number of personnel. Provincial-level Party and government organs should take the lead in streamlining institutions, and the number of cadres to be transferred should account for more than 36% of the actual number of personnel. Administrative management personnel in various public institutions should be reduced by approximately 47%. Management personnel in local state-owned enterprises should be reduced by 50% to 60%. Management personnel in state-owned enterprises should also be greatly reduced.
    In order to do this work well, the meeting decided to establish a special office to provide unified leadership. All transferred cadres must be transferred to the end, not layer by layer. At the same time as transferring cadres, it is necessary to streamline institutions, reduce unnecessary levels, pay attention to strengthening grassroots leadership, and study and solve system problems in connection. Some departments, bureaus, and commissions of provincial-level organs will be merged, abolished, or work together. Most of the transferred cadres will go to the countryside to participate in production; a few will do grassroots work in the countryside, while also participating in productive labor; and some will become workers, salespeople, and primary school teachers, etc. Leading departments at all levels must use revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods, rely on the masses to formulate specific plans, submit them to the masses for discussion, and fully do ideological work, and must not act rashly.

    整改中要抓住紧缩机构这一环节
    吉林省将下放干部十万名
    本报长春18日电　记者陈迹报道：中共吉林省委从12日到14日连续召开常委会议、省委扩大会议，根据中共八届三中全会的精神，讨论了全省整风运动的情况和问题，并且确定了全省紧缩机构、下放干部的方案；要求从现在开始，到明年4月以前，全省将要陆续下放干部十万名左右（包括国营企业和大专学校在内），参加生产劳动和基层工作。
    会议认为：全省反右派斗争，已经基本上取得了决定性的胜利。大批右派分子已被驳倒，群众觉悟大大提高。在参加整风运动的六百四十多个单位中，已有一部分陆续转入着重整改阶段。省直属机关第一批开展整风运动的单位，约有半数已经或正在转向着重整改阶段。由于整风运动发展得不平衡，部分单位还处在反右派斗争的高潮，少数单位尚未深入展开反右派斗争。这些单位要继续努力，彻底挖掘与斗争右派分子，决不能草率收兵。但是，目前领导重点应该在反右派斗争的胜利基础上，分批引导运动转入着重整改阶段。整改的主要内容是：检查关于贯彻中央方针、政策中的问题，特别是有关社会主义改造和社会主义建设、有关发展工农业生产方面存在的问题，认真改进领导工作；检查领导与群众的关系，整顿领导作风，紧缩机构，下放干部，改变制度上和组织上的不合理规定，克服官僚主义和宗派主义特殊化的倾向；检查关于执行民族政策中的问题，克服大汉族主义和地方民族主义，增强民族团结。
    会议指出：整改工作和反击右派具有同等重要意义，决不可忽视任何一方面。做好整改工作的关键，在于领导要有决心，坚定地相信群众多数，继续发动群众大鸣大放。现在还有一些领导干部对于整改工作的重要意义认识不足。他们有的自己有缺点，害怕引火烧身，甚至借口反右派来掩盖缺点；有的不相信群众多数，耽心右派分子在整改中乘机反攻；或者是满足于前一阶段边整边改的成就，没有进一步依靠群众来解决一些带有根本性的重大问题的思想准备。会议批判了这些不正确的看法，要求各级领导人员都要抓紧整改工作，运用大鸣大放大辩论的民主形式，用群众的压力和群众的智慧，来改进工作、改正缺点。
    在整改工作中要抓住紧缩机构、下放干部这一环节。随着社会主义事业的发展，全省曾经扩大编制，增设机构，这在当时是必要的。但是由于缺少经验，控制不严，因此某些机构发展得过于庞大，层次重叠，人浮于事。党政领导机关的干部过多，其中大部分干部没有经过严重阶级斗争和生产劳动的锻炼，缺少基层工作的经验。在省级党、政机关的干部中，约有70％以上未在基层工作过。全省事业单位的行政管理人员，占全体职工总数44．4％。地方国营企业的管理人员，占职工总数的27．8％。国营企业的管理人员也过多。这种非生产人员过多、机构臃肿的现象，不但浪费国家人力、财力，而且助长官僚主义、主观主义的发展，有害于干部的培养和成长。会议要求：县以上各级党政领导机关下放干部大约要占实有人员28％左右。省级党政机关要带头紧缩机构，下放干部的人数要占实有人员36％以上，各事业单位行政管理人员要减少47％左右。地方国营企业管理人员要减少50％到60％。国营企业管理人员也要大大减少。
    为了做好这一工作，会议决定成立专门的办公室，统一领导。一切下放干部都要一放到底，不要层层下放。在下放干部的同时，要紧缩机构，减少不必要的层次，注意加强基层的领导，并且要联系研究解决体制问题。省级机关一些部、厅、局、委，或者合并、撤销，或者合署办公。大部分下放干部，都到农村参加生产；少数去做农村基层工作，同时参加生产劳动；有的则去当工人、营业员和小学教员等。各级领导部门都要用革命的精神和革命的办法，依靠群众制订出具体方案，交给群众讨论；并且要充分做好思想工作，不可草率从事。
