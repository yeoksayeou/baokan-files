    From City to Countryside, From Inland to Border Areas:
    Mass Sports Activities Flourish

    (Our report) Over the past few years, thanks to the attention and care of the Party and the People's Government for sports, and due to the implementation of the policy of serving the people's health, economic construction, and national defense construction, mass sports activities have developed unprecedentedly throughout the country, from cities to the countryside, from the inland to border areas.

    At present, 34,114 grassroots sports associations have been established nationwide, with a total of 4,726,492 members. Due to the establishment of sports associations, the organization and leadership of mass sports activities have been strengthened, and the number of people participating in sports activities has increased day by day.

    The Labor and Defense System has been universally promoted in secondary schools and above, and many factories, mines, and institutions are also gradually promoting it. More than 3,290,000 people nationwide have participated in Labor and Defense System exercises, and more than 1,200,000 people have reached the various levels of standards of the Labor and Defense System. This has played a great role in enhancing the people's physical fitness and improving the efficiency of production and learning.

    Simple and easy-to-learn broadcast exercises, a new form of sports that attracts the masses to participate in physical exercise, have been widely promoted in factories, mines, institutions, schools, and troops. According to statistics from 6,877 factories and mining enterprises in October last year alone, one million people regularly participated in broadcast exercise.

    Defense sports such as shooting, gliding, parachuting, aviation modeling, motorcycle riding, navigation, and radio, which have been newly developed in our country, are loved by the majority of young people. In more than 50 large and medium-sized cities across the country, 400,000 people have participated in various activities, and they have become a strong reserve force for national defense.

    National forms of sports activities such as martial arts have been launched in various places, especially in rural areas, under leadership. In areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, various forms of sports activities with ethnic characteristics are also very active.

    In order to ensure the widespread development of mass sports activities and continuously improve the level of sports, all localities have attached great importance to the training of sports cadres, sports activists, and the construction of venues. At present, three sports colleges have been established nationwide, and 16 normal colleges have sports departments. One hundred and five amateur sports schools for teenagers have been established nationwide, and many places have established sports cadre training classes, where tens of thousands of teenagers, sports workers, and sports activists have been trained. While carrying out mass sports activities, many sports fields have also been built in various places. This measure has fundamentally changed the backward sports foundation left over from old China. From the founding of the country to 1956, 25 provinces and cities and two autonomous regions built a total of 42 provincial-level public stadiums, 17 gymnasiums, 137 sports fields, and 104 artificial swimming pools. At the grassroots level of factories and mines, according to statistics from 25 provinces, cities, two autonomous regions, and the railway sector, a total of 25,992 various sports fields, 217 swimming pools, and 596 skating rinks were built. The number of basketball and volleyball courts in rural areas is also considerable.

    With the widespread development of mass sports activities and the continuous improvement of sports standards, sports competitions in various places are also very active. In 1956, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country held 6,514 sports meets, with more than 1,839,000 participants. Competitive activities have also played a huge role in promoting and promoting the development of mass sports.

    In order to improve mass sports on the basis of popularization, all localities have also promoted the athlete grading system. By the first half of 1957, there were 57,112 graded athletes nationwide.

    It should be particularly pointed out that in rural areas, where there was almost no sports activity in old China, sports activities are now widely carried out. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 6,540 farmer basketball teams in Shandong and Hebei provinces alone. Even in many places in Yunnan Province, on the border, almost "every township has a court, and every commune has a team."

    从城市到农村　从内地到边疆
    群众性体育运动蓬勃发展
    本报讯　几年来，由于党和人民政府对体育事业的重视和关怀，由于贯彻执行了为人民健康、为经济建设和国防建设服务的方针，群众性体育运动在全国范围内，从城市到农村，从内地到边疆，都有了空前的蓬勃发展。
    目前，全国已建立了三万四千一百一十四个基层体育协会，共有会员四百七十二万六千四百九十二名。由于体育协会的建立，群众性体育运动的组织和领导加强了，参加体育活动的人日益增多。
    劳卫制在中等以上学校普遍推行，很多厂矿、机关等也在逐步地推行。全国已有三百二十九万多人参加劳卫制锻炼，一百二十多万人达到了劳卫制各级标准。这对增强人民体质，提高生产和学习的效率起了很大的作用。
    简单易行的广播体操，是一种吸引广大群众参加体育锻炼的新的体育形式，在厂矿、机关、学校和部队中已广泛推行。仅据去年10月份在六千八百七十七个厂矿企业中统计，经常参加广播操锻炼的就有一百万人。
    在我国新开展的射击、滑翔、跳伞、航空模型、摩托车、航海、无线电等国防体育运动项目，为广大青少年所热爱。在全国五十多个大中城市中，已有四十万人参加了各项活动，他们已成为一支强大的国防后备力量。
    武术等民族形式的体育活动，在各地，特别是在农村有领导地展开。在少数民族聚居地区，富有民族特色的各种形式的体育活动，也很活跃。
    为了保证群众性体育运动的广泛展开和不断地提高运动水平，各地对培养体育工作干部、体育积极分子和场地建设工作给予了很大的重视。目前，全国已设立三个体育学院，有十六个师范学院设有体育系科，全国已建立了青少年业余体育学校一百零五所，有很多地方成立了体育干部训练班，成千上万的青少年、体育工作者和体育积极分子在那里受到了培养和锻炼。在开展群众性体育运动的同时，各地还修建了很多运动场。这一措施，使旧中国遗留下的落后的体育基础，根本改观。从建国到1956年，二十五个省市和两个自治区，共修建了省一级的公共体育场四十二处，体育馆十七处，运动场一百三十七处，人造游泳池一百零四处。在基层厂矿，据二十五个省市两个自治区及铁路方面的统计，共修建各种运动场二万五千九百九十二个，游泳池二百一十七个，滑冰场五百九十六个。农村中的篮球、排球场为数也很可观。
    随着群众性体育运动的普遍开展和运动水平的不断提高，各地的运动竞赛也很活跃。1956年全国各省、市、自治区举办的运动会就有六千五百一十四次，参加的有一百八十三万九千多人。竞赛活动对宣传和推动群众体育运动的开展也起了很巨大的作用。
    为了使群众运动在普及的基础上提高，各地还都推行了运动员等级制度，到1957年上半年，全国已有五万七千一百一十二名等级运动员。
    应该特别指出的是，在旧中国几乎完全没有体育活动的农村，目前体育活动也广泛开展起来。据不完全统计，只山东、河北两省农民篮球队就有六千五百四十多个。就连边疆的云南省的很多地方，几乎是“乡乡有球场，社社有球队”。
