Carry the Struggle Between Two Lines Through to the End

The experience of the socialist education movement in rural Guangdong proves that not only in the first three stages of solving ideological problems should there be extensive airing of views and debates, but also in the fourth stage of resolving specific problems, there should be the same

By our reporter Lin Li

At the beginning of the rural socialist education movement, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed its subordinates that to do a good job in the socialist education movement, it must be carried out in five steps. That is: first, extensively air views and let people speak out freely; then, reorganize the ranks; then, engage in extensive debate; then, improve work; and finally, strengthen organizational construction. Up to now, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives that launched the first batch of socialist education movements have completed the first two steps, and are now at the climax of extensive debate. A few pioneering cooperatives have begun a new stage of systematically improving their work.

Originally, during the reorganization of the ranks, Guangdong emphasized the importance of extensive debate repeatedly. People said that the great debate is the decisive stage of the socialist education movement, the key of the key. If the great debate is not done well, it is equivalent to spreading capitalist toxins in an organized way, equal to opening up a free market for capitalist ideas. Because of this clear ideological guidance, the great debates in various parts of Guangdong have generally been smooth and healthy, and their role in consolidating the socialist positions in the countryside is huge. However, some people misunderstood the emphasis on the importance of the third step, thinking that the fourth and fifth steps were not important, or not very important. Therefore, when the third step was completed, many people breathed a sigh of relief and said: The high mountains and big rivers have been crossed, and what remains are just some technical or trivial issues. Because of this thinking, a hasty conclusion and a slackening of efforts generally appeared when entering the fourth step.

Through the great debate, the peasants understood the fundamental differences between capitalism and socialism, and the cadres of the institutions also underwent a profound political and class education. The production enthusiasm of the masses and the work enthusiasm of the cadres have been greatly improved. The achievements are significant and enormous. But the estimation of the great debate should not be too high. Deep-rooted capitalist ideas will never be completely eliminated in one movement. Facts prove that after the great debate, the airing of views did not stop, and the debates were quite intense. In some places, the airing of views and debates even exceeded the previous three steps. For example, the Shayuan Cooperative in Shaoguan Prefecture was originally one of the agricultural cooperatives that had aired views deeply, let people speak out thoroughly, and debated relatively successfully. A total of more than 200 opinions were raised in the first three steps, but in the fourth step, more than 100 more opinions were raised at once. In the Houguantian Cooperative in Zhanjiang Prefecture, more than 240 opinions were raised in the great debate. In Xinhui County, some people repeatedly refused to attend meetings during the great debate, but when it was said that the amount of private plots was to be discussed, many people came without being asked. A cooperative in Shunde County came up with a plan for a labor day income of 3.2 yuan when discussing the production plan. At first, people were very happy, but upon inspection, it was found that it was all based on speculation and profiteering. After further investigation, it was discovered that the plan was drafted by several wealthy middle peasants. The Foshan Prefecture summarized the problems exposed in the fourth step and said that the fourth step involved a wide range of aspects, and the problems were very complex. There were airings of views and people speaking out on specific problems, and there were disputes and debates on ideological problems. In terms of depth and breadth, the struggle situation in the fourth step was more intense and acute, and not as simple as some people imagined. The Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee once analyzed and summarized the things that were aired in the fourth step and found that although people did not say that cooperation was bad, they disagreed with the principle of agriculture as the main focus, opposed expanding the scale of agricultural cooperative production, advocated unlimited expansion of private side occupations, increased private plots, and insisted on the requirement of contracting production to households in management.

The reasons for this tense situation are: First, although the policies had been repeatedly explained in the early stages of airing views and during the debate, some wealthy middle peasants who were "cautious in attitude" still wanted to "wait and see." After the debate, they understood that socialist education was indeed "moving the mouth but not the hands," and was indeed solving problems ideologically. Therefore, those who were hiding behind the scenes came to the forefront, and the "old toads" that were sinking to the bottom of the water floated to the surface. The appearance of these people led to the tense situation where there was still airing of views in the fourth step, and the acute situation where there were disputes and debates. Therefore, the Foshan Prefectural Committee believes that the fourth step is still a continuation of airing views and a continuation of debate. Without this airing of views and debate, the movement will produce a "half-baked" phenomenon, which needs to be prevented. Second, the first three steps before the great debate mainly talked about principles and fought against ideas, without involving issues of personal interest. In the fourth step, people want to institutionalize and codify the socialist principles and systems that have been recognized ideologically, and to re-examine the past management policies and management systems according to socialist principles. Things that do not conform to this principle must be changed. This change affects every farming household and every individual. People who have raised their awareness demand to block capitalist loopholes and cut off capitalist tails. People whose ideological awareness has not been resolved, or has not been resolved at all, demand to retain certain unreasonable systems and regulations. Some people who expressed surrender in the great debate want to "make a comeback" when they encounter specific problems. In this way, a struggle between two roads on solving specific problems appears. Because the systems and regulations are related to every household and every individual, the struggle situation is more acute than before. In order to illustrate the importance of the current situation, the Foshan Prefectural Committee calls the fourth step the period of "close combat," which is not without reason. Third, because the fourth step is to improve all systems, regulations and ordinances that do not conform to socialist principles, and because this work is related to every household and every individual, not only the general masses, but also township and cooperative cadres and party members come out to air their views and debate. The problems exposed include not only the capitalist ideas of wealthy middle peasants, but also the individualism, egalitarianism, localism, and conservative ideas of township and cooperative cadres and party members, and so on. Therefore, people say that this section involves the widest range of aspects and the most complex problems.

In order to carry the socialist education movement through to the end, Guangdong has reconsidered and rearranged the work and wording of the fourth step. The Foshan Prefectural Committee calls the three steps before the great debate the first stage of the socialist education movement, and the next two steps the second stage, also called the new climax of the socialist education movement. The intention is to make cadres at all levels clear about the direction of the fourth step. The Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee emphasized that when turning to the fourth step, it is necessary to rearm the cadres' thinking and repeatedly explain that the struggle has not ended. At the same time, it criticized the complacency and slackening emotions and the demands for shift changes of some cadres. The Shaoguan Prefectural Committee pointed out that when the movement turns to the fourth step, it is still necessary to implement the spirit of extensive airing of views and great debate. The idea that extensive airing of views and great debate can be stopped is unrealistic and incorrect. It must be recognized that extensive airing of views and great debate is a new mass line working method for resolving contradictions among the people. This method should be used not only when solving ideological problems, but also when solving specific problems.

    把两条路线的斗争贯彻到底
    广东农村社会主义教育运动的经验证明：不但在解决思想问题的前三个阶段要大鸣大争，在转入解决具体问题的第四个阶段同样要大鸣大争
    本报记者  林里
    农村社会主义教育运动的初期，中共广东省委便指示所属说，要把社会主义教育运动做好，就必须分做五步走。就是说：首先大放大鸣，继而整编队伍，然后大争大辩，再后改进工作，最后是组织建设。到目前止，第一批展开社会主义教育运动的农业社，绝大多数走完了前两步，现在正是大争大辩的高潮，少数先行社已开始了系统改进工作的新阶段。
    原在整编队伍的时候，广东各地便一再强调大辩论的重要。人们说，大辩论是社会主义教育运动的决战阶段，是关键中的关键，如果不把大辩论做好，那就等于有组织的散布资本主义毒素，等于给资本主义思想开辟了自由市场。因为有了这样明确的思想指导，所以广东各地的大辩论，一般是顺利的，健康的，对巩固农村社会主义阵地的作用是巨大的。但是另外，却有人把强调第三步的重要，误以为四步、五步不重要，或者不太重要。因此，当第三步走完了的时候，不少人便大松一口气说：高山大河已经过来了，剩下的只不过是些技术问题，或枝节问题。因为有了这种思想，所以进入第四步的时候，就普遍出现了草率收兵的现象和松劲情绪。
    经过大辩论，农民认识了资本主义和社会主义的根本区别，机关干部也经过了一次深刻的政治教育和阶级教育，群众的生产劲头和干部的工作积极性都大大提高，成绩是显著的，巨大的。但是对大辩论的估计不能过高，根深蒂固的资本主义思想，绝不会在一次运动中清除干净。事实证明，大辩论后鸣放并没有停止，争辩也相当激烈，有些地方的鸣放和争辩，还超过了前三步。像韶关专区的沙园社，原是鸣得深，放得透，争辩也比较成功的农业社之一。前三步中总共提了二百多条意见，但在第四步当中，一下又放出一百多条。湛江专区的后观田社，大辩论中又提出了二百四十多条意见。新会县在大辩论中，有些人再三催促不到会，但是一说讨论自留地数量，许多人不叫就来了。顺德县有一个社，在讨论生产规划的时候，出现了一个劳动日收入三元二角的方案，开始人们很高兴，但一检查，全是依靠投机倒把来获利，又一深追，才发现这个方案是靠几个富裕中农拟定的。佛山专区综合了第四步中所暴露出来的问题，说第四步牵涉的方面很广，问题又很复杂，有具体问题的鸣和放，有思想问题的争和辩，从深度和宽度上来说，第四步的斗争形势更紧张，更尖锐，决不像某些人所想像的那样简单。湛江地委曾把第四步中鸣放出来的东西作了一番分析归纳，发现人们虽然不说合作化不好，但是不同意农业为主的方针，反对扩大农业社的生产规模，主张无限制地扩大私人副业，增多自留地，在经营管理上坚持包产到户的要求。
    造成这种紧张形势的原因，一是鸣放初期和辩论当中，虽然反复地交代过政策，但有些“态度慎重”的富裕中农还要“看一看”。经过辩论，他们懂得了社会主义教育确乎是“动口不动手”，确乎是从思想上解决问题。因此，躲在幕后的人走到了前台，沉在水底的“老蛤”浮出了水面。这些人的出现，就出现了第四步仍然有鸣有放的紧张局面，就出现了有争有辩的尖锐形势。所以佛山地委认为，第四步中仍然是鸣放的继续，是争辩的继续，没有这个鸣放和争辩，运动就会产生“夹生”现象，这是需要防止的；其次，大辩论以前的三个步骤当中，主要是讲道理，斗思想，没有涉及到切身利益问题。在第四步中，人们要把思想上承认了的社会主义原则制度化，条文化，要根据社会主义原则重新审定过去的经营方针和管理制度，不符合这一原则的东西要改掉，这一改，就关系到每一户农家和每一个人。提高了觉悟的人要求堵塞资本主义的漏洞，割掉资本主义的尾巴，思想觉悟没有解决问题，或者完全没有解决问题的人，则要求保留某些不合理的制度和法规。有些在大辩论中表示缴械投诚的人，一遇到具体问题又想“卷土重来”。这样一来，就出现了解决具体问题上的两条道路的斗争。因为制度、法规关系到每一户和每一个人，所以斗争形势也比以前更尖锐。为了说明当前形势的重要，佛山地委把第四步叫做“短兵相接”的时期，这话不无道理；第三，因为第四步的工作是要改进一切不符合社会主义原则的制度、法规和条例，因为这个工作关系到每一户和每一个人，所以出来鸣放和争辩的，不仅有一般群众，而且有乡社干部和党团员，暴露出来的问题，不仅有富裕中农的资本主义思想，而且还有乡社干部和党团员的个人主义、平均主义、本位主义和保守思想，以及其他等等。因此，人们说这一段牵涉的方面最广，问题也最复杂。
    为了把社会主义教育运动贯彻到底，广东各地对第四步的工作和提法，都做了重新考虑和重新安排。佛山地委把大辩论以前的三个步骤，叫做社会主义教育运动的第一阶段，把今后的两步叫做第二阶段，又叫做社会主义教育运动的新高潮。意思是要各级干部明确第四步的方向。湛江地委强调在转向第四步的时候，必须再一次武装干部思想，反复说明斗争并没有结束，同时批判了某些干部的自满松劲情绪和换班要求。韶关地委指出：运动转向第四步，还必须贯彻大放大鸣与大争的精神。那种认为大放大鸣与大争可以停止的想法是不现实，也是不正确的。必须认识，大放大鸣与大争，是解决人民内部矛盾的一种新的群众路线的工作方法。这个方法，不仅在解决思想问题的时候运用，而且在解决具体问题时也要运用。
