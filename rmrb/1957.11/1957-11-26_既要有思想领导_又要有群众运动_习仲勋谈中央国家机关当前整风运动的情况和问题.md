    Must Have Ideological Leadership and Mass Movement
    Xi Zhongxun Discusses the Situation and Problems of the Current Rectification Movement in Central State Organs

    Xinhua News Agency, November 25th. Secretary-General of the State Council, Xi Zhongxun, delivered a second mobilization report on rectification at a cadre meeting of organizations directly under the State Council and various offices of the State Council on the 21st, calling for continued in-depth airing of views and thorough rectification and reform. In his report, Xi Zhongxun discussed some important issues on how to use the situation created by airing views to further promote the current rectification movement in state organs.

    Everyone has a task of transforming themselves. "Small gaps" cannot be ignored; "small gaps" can also become "large gaps."

    Xi Zhongxun said that our country is currently in a high tide of socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. How should everyone act in this great revolution? Has everyone deeply considered this issue? Most people have decided to take the socialist road, which is settled, but how to take it? There are several ways to take it, and this question has not necessarily been resolved by everyone. Taking the staff of state organs as an example, not everyone is wholeheartedly responsible for the cause of communism. The country requires that everyone be transformed very well, possessing a proletarian stance and viewpoint, working conscientiously, understanding the lives and feelings of workers and peasants, and having not only book knowledge but also experience in labor production struggles, having real talent and practical skills, and being able to withstand risks. In the future, the country will need such people to build it, and everyone must transform themselves according to this standard. At present, among the cadres, many have been transformed well; but there are also many who have been transformed to some extent but still have some "small gaps." "Small gaps" cannot be ignored; "small gaps" can also become "large gaps." Some old cadres who have been working for one or two decades make mistakes because of these "small gaps." There are also some who have not yet been transformed.

    Xi Zhongxun emphasized that now is a high tide of socialist revolution, and everyone should consider how to train, transform, and improve their socialist consciousness, master more socialist ideas, and get rid of capitalist ideas. We must understand that political work is the lifeline of all work.

    He said that the rectification movement is only a short period of time, but the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is a long-term struggle, especially the political and ideological struggle. Everyone has a task of transforming themselves, so they must take rectification seriously. It is essential that we seize the current revolutionary high tide and concentrate our efforts to conduct a systematic and profound socialist ideological education for the vast number of cadres and the people.

    Some people doubt why so many cadres are being sent down to labor training. Is it being done too fiercely and tensely? Is it a rash advance? Xi Zhongxun said that revolution is a leap forward. Socialism cannot be built without several revolutionary leaps forward. I think this year's nationwide rectification movement is a revolutionary leap forward, and the upcoming high tide of rural socialist construction is another revolutionary leap forward. We need this kind of revolutionary leap forward and oppose subjective adventurism. The current measures are a revolution of profound significance, based on the needs of the country and future development. Therefore, every revolutionary must support and actively participate in this movement.

    The rectification situation in central state organs has already formed, and no one can stop it. If you have opinions now but don't speak out, you can only blame yourself for being backward. Individual units have "agreements" to restrict the airing of views.

    Xi Zhongxun then talked about the current development of the rectification movement in central state organs. He said that from the perspective of the entire central state organs, the high tide of airing views in the rectification stage has arrived. Various organs have currently produced more than 220,000 big-character posters and raised more than 380,000 opinions. This situation shows that the rectification situation has been created, and airing views is no longer a problem; no one can stop it. Anyone with any opinions can speak out. If you don't speak out now, you can only blame yourself for being backward. Of course, there are still individual units that restrict the airing of views, making so-called agreements: not allowing people to talk about the issue of eliminating counter-revolutionaries, not allowing people to talk about the issue of developing the Party, and not allowing people to talk about the private lives of cadres. According to investigations, the person in charge of this unit has "pigtails" on these issues and is afraid that the masses will grab these "pigtails," so they came up with this clever plan. Private lives should not be interfered with, and general matters can also not be discussed, but illegal and undisciplined matters must be discussed. The above-mentioned practice of restricting airing views is actually putting a seal on people's mouths, suppressing democracy, and is not in line with the central government's policy, and should be strictly criticized. Some initially required that big-character posters only air views within a specific scope, which is also not good. Everyone should be allowed to say whatever they want.

    When talking about the airing of views in the General Office of the State Council, Xi Zhongxun said that everyone has raised opinions in all aspects, but not many really big problems that need to be changed have been touched upon. This may be the case in the first high tide because big problems are relatively difficult to raise. Therefore, the airing of views must be further deepened.

    Xi Zhongxun said that during the airing of views, big-character posters are indeed a very good weapon. They not only expose problems quickly and sharply but also deeply and widely. They expose many problems that people didn't know about from all corners and aspects. Writing big-character posters doesn't require discussing with anyone. As for whether you read them or not, accept them or not after they are posted, it is entirely up to you. This is actually the democratic life of criticism and self-criticism that we often conduct. We must all learn to listen to other people's opinions. Regardless of whether they are facts or not, as long as they are well-intentioned, even if they are wrong, we must listen. Well-intentioned opinions are not necessarily correct opinions, but listening to them can make us vigilant and avoid or reduce mistakes. It is a very good thing to improve everyone's thinking and improve our work through such normal democratic life, and we should continue to maintain such democratic life in the future.

    There are two stages of airing views; the first stage is general airing views; the second stage is thematic airing views. In the first stage, big-character posters are the main form; in the second stage, forums and debates may become the main form.

    Big-character posters are not only a very good form of airing views but also a major form of airing views. Whether the high tide of airing views has arrived depends on how many big-character posters are produced and how many problems are raised. It is not easy to produce big-character posters. Anyone who puts out a big-character poster has to consider whether the facts themselves are correct, what impact it will have after it is posted, whether they will be retaliated against, and so on. Some people think that putting out big-character posters is a waste of paper. We say, what's wrong with wasting some money to learn some skills? A good big-character poster doesn't necessarily have to be long. The masses reflect: "Forums are warnings face to face, big-character posters are warnings in public." It can be seen that big-character posters are a form that the masses love very much. We must trust the masses. If the masses use their brains, knowledge will be enriched. Therefore, the main form of airing views should be big-character posters, and forums and debates can only be auxiliary forms of airing views.

    Xi Zhongxun pointed out that there are two stages of airing views: the first stage is general airing of views, or concentrated airing of views, saying whatever you want; the second stage is thematic airing of views, or in-depth airing of views. The form of airing views in the first stage is mainly big-character posters; in the second stage, forums and debates may become the main form. In this stage, in-depth research is carried out, and consultations are held with relevant units. It is necessary to sit down and consider the issues very carefully. After the movement deepens, the issues involved will become more complex and larger.

    In rectification, there must be both ideological leadership and mass movement. Don't be too polite; have the spirit to lead the movement. The method of "picking up sesame seeds first and then hugging watermelons" can be used for rectification.

    What should be done after the high tide of airing views arrives? Xi Zhongxun said that the problems have been laid out, and the contradictions have been revealed. The next step should be thorough rectification and reform. However, the relatively common situation in various organs at present is that the high tide of airing views has arrived, but the actual work of rectification cannot keep up. The leadership should realize that airing views is for rectification, and rectification must keep up with airing views. If the two are not connected, the movement cannot move forward.

    Why can't rectification keep up with airing views? First, lack of experience. Second, not good at following the mass line, and the leadership lacks the drive and methods for rectification. Third, many units are using the usual methods and styles to deal with rectification, using bureaucratic methods to overcome bureaucracy. Therefore, the movement appears weak and powerless. This is a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts and a nationwide rectification movement. We must never treat this movement with the usual methods and must never be too polite. We should jump out of the old circles of the past, the leadership's thinking should be ahead of the movement, and we must have the spirit to lead the movement and a fighting attitude. Work should be both intense and have a plan.

    There are many methods of rectification, but the most basic is to have both ideological leadership and mass movement. Ideological work is the guarantee of all work, and at the same time, we must rely on the masses to solve problems. The leadership must be combined with the masses, and neither can be biased. Therefore, there must be a strong leadership core, and the vast masses must use their brains. If this problem is not solved, the rectification movement will become a "flash in the pan" and will be over. The big-character poster form of the high tide of airing views will pass, but the enthusiastic and active revolutionary spirit cannot disappear. Rectification is not for a temporary excitement but to solve long-term problems. Now, it is not possible to ask each unit to put forward complete rectification plans. In my opinion, after the high tide of airing views appears, rectification can be carried out in stages, going all the way to the end. First, in one unit, work with the people who made the suggestions to change the most direct and large-scale (about 90%) of the problems. That is to say, rectification can use the method of "picking up sesame seeds first and then hugging watermelons," starting with the easy and then the difficult.

    While carrying out rectification in stages, the leadership can organize special groups to study plans for some larger problems. When making plans, don't just have a few leaders shut themselves in a room to do it; you should also sit down and study with the people who made the suggestions, combining the leadership with the masses, combining rectification with the masses, and learning the working method of following the mass line.

    Every problem raised in every big-character poster must be accounted for. Anything that can be resolved immediately should be resolved immediately and answered in a timely manner. For those that cannot be resolved immediately, a plan can be proposed first and submitted to the masses for discussion; for those that involve many aspects and need to be considered carefully, the reasons should also be explained to the masses. Wrong opinions also have answers, and the people who made the suggestions can be educated. For some problems involving individuals, the person who was criticized can visit the person who made the suggestions to express acceptance. In short, there should be a variety of methods.

    The main steps of rectification: (1) Airing views extensively; (2) Concentrated rectification; (3) Sending cadres down to labor training, combined with debates; (4) Normal and in-depth rectification.

    Xi Zhongxun believes that rectification will have the following main steps: (1) Airing views extensively to create a high tide of airing views. The time is about two weeks. (2) Concentrated rectification, or general rectification, combined with debates. The rectification of most problems does not require debate. A portion of the problems requires the proposal of a plan for discussion by the masses, so not all problems are debated. The time is about two weeks. (3) Sending cadres down to labor training, combined with debates. The time is about two weeks, or longer. (4) Then shift to normal and in-depth rectification work, including large-scale debates and ideological criticism, as well as handling leftover issues from the anti-rightist struggle. If the entire rectification stage is three months, then this step will take another month and a half, and major issues of rectification must be completed during this time. People who are going down have left, and people who are not going down can focus on rectification. In normal rectification, the first step is to have a large-scale debate. Everyone has their own ideas about taking the socialist road, and in-depth debates and criticism should be carried out on erroneous ideas and confused concepts.

    Each step of rectification must be closely combined with socialist ideological education. At the same time as rectification, routine work cannot be delayed, and rectification and work must not be neglected. Routine work can only be done well in combination with rectification.

    Sending cadres down to participate in physical labor is a major revolutionary measure; it is not for "unloading burdens" or "closing shop" but for "unified arrangement and comprehensive transformation."

    Xi Zhongxun finally emphasized the issue of sending cadres down to participate in labor training. He said that sending cadres down to participate in labor this time is not for "unloading burdens" or "closing shop" but for "unified arrangement and comprehensive transformation." This is a major revolutionary measure, an important part of rectification, and has a positive purpose. Now some units have the phenomenon of pushing people out and not caring about them, which is wrong. It is not simply about unloading burdens but about unified arrangement and comprehensive transformation. Cadres who stay in the organs must also be transformed. The work and style of the organs must also be greatly improved. These cadres have a share in the achievements of socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past few years. However, if they are not sent down now, it will be terrible. In another ten years, who knows what the situation will be? A large group of bureaucrats who are divorced from reality and divorced from the masses will be cultivated. How can we carry out socialism?

    Xi Zhongxun pointed out that sending cadres down to participate in labor has three major significances:

      (1) Overcoming the bureaucratic and subjectivist work style of being divorced from reality and divorced from the masses;
      (2) Establishing a cadre team that struggles for the cause of communism, has been trained, and can withstand risks;
      (3) Saving a lot of manpower and financial resources, strengthening the labor front, strengthening the grassroots, and accelerating socialist construction. A large cadre team across the country will go to the countryside and mountains, bringing socialism, culture, and technology to the countryside. The face of the countryside will be greatly changed, and the socialist construction of agriculture will inevitably accelerate.

    This is a big and complex matter, and there is a series of issues that need to be unifiedly arranged. Beijing has already sent down more than 20,000 cadres, setting an example for us. The method is good and we should learn from them.

    The purpose of cadres going down to participate in agricultural labor is to transform themselves. Every cadre, especially young intellectuals, must go through this lesson. Cadres who are too old or sick and cannot engage in physical labor should not go down. Technical personnel should also be treated differently and do not necessarily have to go down.

    What will be the future prospects of the cadres who are sent down? In the past, they only knew that being a cadre was good, but they didn't know what kind of cadre it was good to be. Labor training is for the purpose of solving this problem. If they are transformed well, their future will be very bright. Now many people are determined to go down to labor training, which is a great step forward. The question is who goes first and who goes later. Every cadre, especially young intellectuals, must go through this lesson. The purpose of going down is to transform. In a few years, the country will need more and more cadres. The future cadre team will be built on this group of cadres who have been trained and transformed, who can both connect with the masses and understand production knowledge. Good cadres in the future may be produced from this group of cadres who are sent down.

    Sending cadres down for training is a policy affirmed by the Party and the government, which can cause a series of reforms and changes and can play a role in changing customs and habits. Therefore, especially young intellectuals, should make up their minds earlier. It is difficult to make a decision because life will undergo a series of changes. Some people's ancestors for three generations have lived in the city and have never lived in the countryside. Now they have to go to the countryside and become one with the working people, work and live with the peasants. It is not a simple matter to go from being unaccustomed to being accustomed.

    The idea that intellectuals thought that mental labor was superior to physical labor in the past must be defeated. Physical labor and mental labor must be combined, and the individual and the collective must be combined.

    Some people describe the life in the countryside as very beautiful, which is not realistic. If it is said too well, the cadres will be disappointed as soon as they go down. Participating in agricultural labor is not easy at first, and it really requires a complete transformation, which is also a thorough transformation of the body. It is necessary to be realistic so that they are mentally prepared; otherwise, if they are pushed out, they will run back and complain to you.

    Sending cadres down must be combined with solving the system, streamlining the organization, and rectifying the establishment; it must be combined with work and rectification; and there must be a unified arrangement. Cadres who are too old or sick and cannot engage in physical labor should not go down, and they must never add trouble to the peasants. Technical personnel should be treated differently and do not necessarily have to go down. They can be organized to participate in labor for a certain period of time in conjunction with their own work, or they can be organized to participate in physical labor in their own organs. Some organs send down people who usually like to make suggestions and criticize, which is not good. Some leading cadres leave their favorite cadres behind and do not let them go, which is actually not caring for the cadres but harming them. Everyone should participate in labor training, and the sooner they participate in labor training, the sooner they will be transformed. The leadership must plan and arrange and must be responsible to the end.

    The cadres who are sent down this time are of two types: one is those who have been streamlined, some of whom are indeed not qualified as cadres, so they are mobilized to resign, and some who are eligible for retirement are retired. After resigning, they can go to the countryside to settle down; the other is those who are sent down in rotation for training.

    More areas should be found for sending down, but they should not be too scattered. Whoever wants to go where can first be democratic and then assigned. Some who are sent down for a long time should be allowed to go home if they wish.

    In short, sending cadres down for labor training is a new issue, and there is no mature experience yet. There are still many issues that need to be debated among the masses. After in-depth research, a set of methods will be proposed.

    既要有思想领导　又要有群众运动
    习仲勋谈中央国家机关当前整风运动的情况和问题
    新华社25日讯　国务院秘书长习仲勋21日在国务院直属机关及国务院各办公室的干部大会上，作了第二次整风动员报告，号召继续深入大鸣大放，大整大改。习仲勋在报告中谈到了如何利用鸣放所造成的形势进一步推动当前国家机关整风运动的一些重要问题。
    每人都有一个改造自己的任务。对“小缺口”不能忽视，“小缺口”也能变成“大缺口”。
    习仲勋说，目前我们国家正处在政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命高潮之中。每个人在这场大革命中如何办？大家是否深刻地考虑过这个问题？多数人决定要走社会主义的道路，这是定了的，但如何走？有几种走法，这个问题不一定每个人都已经解决了。就以国家机关的工作人员来说，不见得每个人都是一心一意为共产主义事业负责的。国家要求将每个人改造得很好，要求具备无产阶级的立场和观点，工作踏踏实实的，懂得工人、农民的生活和感情，不仅有书本知识，还有劳动生产斗争的经验，有真才实学，有真本事，能经得起风险的。将来国家就是要有这样的一些人来建设，每个人也要按照这个标准来改造自己。目前，在干部中，改造好了的不少；但改造了一些，还有些“小缺口”的人也不少，对“小缺口”不能忽视，“小缺口”也能变成“大缺口”，有些一、二十年的老干部犯错误就是因为有“小缺口”；也还有些人是还没有改造的。
    习仲勋强调说，现在是社会主义革命高潮时期，每个人都应该考虑如何锻炼，如何改造，如何提高社会主义觉悟，多掌握一些社会主义思想，去掉资本主义思想。要懂得政治工作是一切工作的生命线。
    他说，整风运动只是一个短暂的时间，至于资产阶级和无产阶级之间的斗争则是长期的斗争，特别是政治上、思想上的斗争，更是长期的事情。每个人都有一个改造自己的任务，因此要认真地对待整风。我们要抓住现在这个革命高潮，集中力量来对广大干部和人民群众进行一次系统的、深刻的社会主义思想教育，是十分必要的。
    有人怀疑为什么要下放那么多干部去劳动锻炼，是不是搞得太凶了，太紧张了呢？是不是冒进了呢？习仲勋说，革命就是跃进，没有几个革命跃进，社会主义是建设不成的。我看今年的全民整风运动就是一个革命跃进，即将到来的农村社会主义建设高潮又是一个革命跃进。我们需要这种革命的跃进，反对那种主观主义的冒进。目前这种措施是一个有深刻意义的革命，是根据国家的需要和将来的发展等方面出发的，因此每一个革命者都一定要支持，并且积极参加这个运动。
    中央国家机关整改形势已经形成，谁要阻挡也阻挡不住。现在有意见要不讲，那就要怪自己落后。个别单位有约法三章，限制鸣放的现象。
    习仲勋接着谈到目前中央国家机关整风运动发展的情况。他说，从整个中央国家机关的情况来看，整改阶段的鸣放高潮已经到来了。各机关目前共出了二十二万多张大字报，提出了三十八万多条意见。这种情况说明整改形势已经造成，鸣放已经不成问题了，谁要阻挡也阻挡不住。谁有什么意见都可以讲，现在若还不说，那就要怪自己落后了。当然，也有个别单位还有限制鸣放的现象，搞什么约法三章：不准人家讲肃反问题，不准讲发展党的问题，不准讲干部的私人生活问题。据调查，这个单位的负责人正是在这几个问题上有“辫子”，怕群众抓住“辫子”，才想出这条妙计。私人生活不要去干涉，一般的也可以不讲，但是属于违法乱纪性质的就一定要讲。像上述限制鸣放的做法，实际上就是在人家的嘴上贴了封条，就是压制民主，同中央的方针是不符合的，应该给予严格的批评。也有的一开始就要求大字报在专题的范围以内鸣放，这也不好，应该让大家有什么放什么。
    习仲勋在谈到国务院秘书厅的鸣放情况时说，在鸣放中大家提了各方面的意见，但是真正要改的大问题涉及得还不多。这在第一个高潮里可能也就是如此了，因为大问题是比较不容易提的，因此，必须进一步深入地鸣放。
    习仲勋说，在大鸣大放中间，大字报的确是一个很好的武器，它不仅揭露问题很快、很尖锐，而且揭露得又深又广。它从各个角落、各个方面把许多人家不知道的问题都揭露出来了。写大字报用不着跟人商量，至于贴出来以后你看不看，接受不接受，完全在你。这实际上就是我们经常所进行的批评和自我批评的民主生活。我们每个人都要学习听取人家的意见，不管是否是事实，只要是善意的，那怕是提错了也要听；善意的意见不一定都是正确的意见，听了可以使我们警惕起来，不犯或少犯错误。通过这样的正常的民主生活，把我们每个人的思想提高了，工作改进了，这是很好的事情，今后我们应该继续保持这样的民主生活。
    鸣放有两个段落；第一段是一般鸣放；第二段是专题鸣放。第一段大字报是主要形式；第二段座谈会、辩论会可能成为主要形式。
    大字报不仅是很好的鸣放形式，而且也是一个主要的鸣放形式。鸣放高潮是否到来，要看大字报出的多少，问题提的多少。出大字报并不是一件很容易的事。任何人出一张大字报都要考虑一下事实本身对不对，贴出来后将会有什么影响，会不会被报复等等。有人认为出大字报浪费纸张，我们说浪费一些钱学一些本事有什么不好？大字报内容好，不一定要写得多。群众反映：“座谈会是当面警告，大字报是当众警告。”可见大字报是群众很喜爱的一种形式。我们要相信群众，群众动脑筋，知识就丰富了。因此，鸣放的主要形式应该是大字报，座谈会、辩论会只能是鸣放的辅助形式。
    习仲勋指出，鸣放有两个段落：第一段是一般鸣放，或者叫集中鸣放，有什么讲什么；第二段是专题鸣放，或者叫深入鸣放。鸣放的形式第一段以大字报为主要形式；第二段座谈会、辩论会可能成为主要形式，在这一段展开深入研究，和有关单位共同协商，要很细致地坐下来考虑问题。运动深入后，涉及的问题也就更复杂更大了。
    在整改中，既要有思想领导，又要有群众运动。不要搞得太斯文，要有领导运动的气魄。可以采用“先拣芝麻，后抱西瓜”的办法进行整改。鸣放高潮来了以后怎么办？习仲勋说，问题都摆出来了，矛盾都揭开了，下一步就应该大整大改。但是目前各机关比较普遍的情况是鸣放高潮已经到来，整改的实际工作跟不上。领导上应该认识到鸣放是为了整改，整改一定要跟上鸣放，如果衔接不上，运动就不能前进了。
    整改为什么跟不上鸣放呢？第一、缺乏经验。第二、不善于走群众路线，领导上缺乏整改的劲头和方法。第三、很多单位是用平时的办法和作风来对待整改，用官僚主义的办法来克服官僚主义。因此运动就显得软弱无力。这次进行的是一场政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，是全民的整风运动，我们绝不能以平时的做法来对待这个运动，绝不能够搞得太斯文了。我们应该跳出过去的旧圈子，领导思想要走在运动前面，要有领导运动的气魄和战斗的姿态。工作既要紧张，又要有步法。
    整改的方法是多种多样的，最基本的是既要有思想领导又要有群众运动。思想工作是一切工作的保证，同时还必须依靠群众来解决问题。领导必须和群众相结合，两者偏一不可。因此要有强有力的领导核心，又要有广大群众开动脑筋。这个问题如不解决，整风运动就成了“昙花一现”，过了就完了。鸣放高潮的大字报形式是会过去的，但热情积极的革命精神不能消失。整风不是为了一时的热闹，而是要解决长远的问题。现在，要求各单位提出完整的整改方案还不可能，我的看法，在鸣放高潮出现后，可先分片进行整改，一竿子搞到底。先在一个单位里和提意见的人一起来把最直接的、大批的（约占90％）问题改了。这就是说，整改可以采用“先拣芝麻，后抱西瓜”的办法，先易后难。
    在分片整改的同时，领导上可组织专门小组研究一些较大问题的方案。搞方案不要仅仅领导上几个人关着门来搞，还要同提意见的人一块座谈研究，做到领导和群众相结合，整改和群众相结合，学会走群众路线的工作方法。
    对每张大字报提出来的每个问题，都必须做到件件有交代。凡是有些能够马上解决的，就马上解决，并且及时作出答复。有些不能马上解决的，可以先提出方案，交群众讨论；有些涉及方面很多，需要慎重考虑的，也应该向群众说明理由。错的意见也有答复，对提意见的人可以受到教育。有些涉及对个别人的问题，被提意见的人可以登门拜访，表示接受。总之，办法要多种多样。
    整改的主要步骤：（1）大鸣大放；（2）集中整改；（3）下放干部劳动锻炼，结合辩论；（4）正常的、深入的整改。
    习仲勋认为，整改将有以下几个主要步骤：（1）大鸣大放造成鸣放高潮。时间约两周左右。（2）集中整改或者叫做一般整改，结合辩论。大多数问题的整改是不用辩论的，有一部分问题需要提出方案，交群众讨论，所以不是全部问题都辩论。时间约两周左右。（3）下放干部劳动锻炼，结合辩论。时间约两周左右，或更长一些。（4）再转入正常的、深入的整改工作，包括大辩论和思想批判，以及处理反右派遗留问题。如果全部整改阶段是三个月的时间，那么这一步还有一个半月，整改的重大问题都必须在这段时间里做好。下去的人走了，不下去的人可以安心整改。在正常整改时，第一步先要大辩论，各人有各人走社会主义的想法，对错误的思想、糊涂观念展开深入的辩论和批判。
    整改的每一个步骤，都必须紧密地结合社会主义思想教育。整改的同时，还不能耽误日常工作，要做到整风、工作两不误。日常工作也只有结合整风才能做好。
    下放干部参加体力劳动，是很大的革命措施；不是为了“卸包袱”、“收摊子”，而是为了“统一安排，全面改造”。
    习仲勋最后着重谈到关于下放干部参加劳动锻炼的问题。他说，这次下放干部参加劳动，不是为了“卸包袱”，也不是为了“收摊子”，而是为了“统一安排，全面改造”。这是一个很大的革命措施，是整风的一个重要内容，是有积极目的的。现在有些单位有推出不管的现象，那是不对的。不能简单地卸包袱，而是要统一安排全面改造。留在机关的干部也要改造。机关的工作和作风也要大大改进。几年来的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的成就，这些干部都有份。但是，如果现在再不下放就不得了，再过十年不知道要变成什么局面，养成一大批脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义者，怎能搞社会主义。
    习仲勋指出，下放干部参加劳动有三方面的重大意义：
      （1）克服脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义和主观主义作风；
      （2）建立一支为共产主义事业奋斗的、经过锻炼、经得起风险的干部队伍；
      （3）节约大量人力财力，加强劳动战线，加强基层，加速社会主义建设。全国将有一支庞大的干部队伍下乡上山，给农村送去社会主义，送去文化和技术，农村的面貌将会大加改变，农业的社会主义建设必将加快。
    这是一件大事情，也很复杂，有一系列的问题需要统一安排。北京市已经下去了二万多干部，为我们树立了榜样，办法是好的，应该向他们学习。
    干部下放参加农业劳动的目的，是为了改造自己，每一个干部特别是青年知识分子，都要经过这一课。年纪太大和有病不能从事体力劳动的干部就不要下去，技术人员也要分别情况，不一定都要下去。
    下放的干部将来的前途如何？过去光知道当干部好，但不知道要当一个什么样的干部好；劳动锻炼就是为的解决这个问题，改造好了，前途很光明。现在很多人有决心下去劳动锻炼，这是一个大进步。问题是先去后去的事，每一个干部特别是青年知识分子，都要经过这一课。下去的目的是为了改造，几年以后国家需要的干部是愈来愈多的。将来的干部队伍就是建立在这批经过锻炼和改造，既能联系群众，又懂生产知识的干部基础上。将来的好干部可能就是产生在这批下去的干部中。
    放干部下去锻炼是党和政府肯定的方针，这可以引起一系列的改革和变化，可以起移风易俗的作用。所以特别是青年知识分子应该早些下决心。决心是难下的，因为生活要发生一系列的变化，有些人祖先三代都住在城市，没有住过农村，现在要到农村和劳动人民打成一片，同农民一起劳动，一起生活，由不习惯到习惯决不是一回简单的事。
    过去知识分子认为脑力劳动高人一等的想法，必须要打垮它。体力劳动和脑力劳动必须相结合，个人和集体必须相结合。
    有些人把下乡生活描写得很美满，这是不实际的。说得太好了，干部一下去就会失望。参加农业劳动开始不是好受的，真要脱胎换骨，对身体也是彻底的改造。说得实事求是，使他们有思想准备，否则推出去，他们是会跑回来埋怨你的。
    下放干部必须和解决体制、紧缩机构、整顿编制等工作相结合；必须和工作、整风相结合；必须有统一安排。年纪太大和有病不能从事体力劳动的干部就不要下去，绝不要给农民增麻烦；技术人员要分别情况，不一定都要下去，可以组织他们结合自己的业务参加一定时间的劳动，或者组织他们在本机关里参加体力劳动。有的机关把平时爱提意见，爱批评的人下放劳动，这不好。有的领导干部把自己喜欢的干部留下不让走，这实际上并不是爱护干部，而是害了干部。人人都要劳动锻炼，早劳动锻炼就早得到改造，领导上必须有计划地安排，必须负责到底。
    这次下放的干部，一种是精简下来的，其中有些确实不够干部条件，就动员退职，有些够退休条件的就退休，退职以后可以下乡安家落户；另一种是轮流下放锻炼的。
    下放的地区，要多找几个，但是也不宜太分散了，谁愿意去哪里，可以先民主，后分派，有些长期下放的如愿意回家，应该允许。
    总之，下放干部劳动锻炼是一个新问题，还没有一套成熟的经验，有很多问题还需要在群众中展开辩论，经过深入研究以后，就会提出一套办法来。
