Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 1st. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee meeting passed the Shaanxi Province Agricultural Economic Development Plan (Draft) from 1958 to 1967 on October 30th. This plan (draft) proposes that the guiding principle for agricultural development in the province over the next ten years (i.e., during the Second and Third Five-Year Plan periods) is: to focus on increasing grain production, actively develop economic crops such as cotton and oilseeds in proportion, greatly develop animal husbandry, and develop forestry, local specialties, and rural sideline production in a comprehensive manner, and comprehensively develop diversified agriculture. According to the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production development targets proposed in the plan (draft), by 1967, the province's total grain output will reach 18.16 billion catties, an increase of 111.9% compared to 1957. The cultivated land in Guanzhong, the northern Shaanxi plains, and irrigated areas north of the Qinling Mountains should reach an average of 400 catties per mu; the cultivated land in the plains and paddy fields south of the Qinling Mountains should reach an average of 900 catties per mu; among them, the average yield per mu in sandy areas, barren land, areas with severe soil erosion, high mountain areas, and shallow mountainous and hilly areas should reach 115 catties, 255 catties, and 310 catties respectively. The province's total cotton output will be 4.53 million dan (lint cotton), an increase of 126.5% compared to 1957, with an average yield of 90.6 catties per mu, an increase of 115.2%. The number of large livestock will increase by 59.4%, sheep by 117.2%, and pigs by 235.6%. Within ten years, the province plans to afforest 26.543 million mu, and the entire province, except for the desert areas of Yulin Prefecture, will be basically greened. This plan (draft) will also be submitted to the State Council for approval.
    Before formulating this plan, the leading organs of Shaanxi Province, the special commissioner's offices, and key counties established planning offices, dispatched more than 700 cadres to conduct typical investigations and specific planning work in 31 townships and 77 cooperatives, and then analyzed and researched the materials by region and profession for comprehensive balance.
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 2nd. Cadres and members of many agricultural cooperatives in more than 40 counties and cities in the Guanzhong Plain of Shaanxi Province excitedly spread the word after reading and studying the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). After carefully studying this program item by item, the cadres and members of many agricultural cooperatives have greatly increased their confidence in advancing towards the socialist road.
    Many agricultural cooperatives have revised or formulated production increase plans based on their specific situations during the study of the Agricultural Development Program. The farmers in Chang'an and Gaoling counties and the suburbs of Xi'an, which had already completed the twelve-year grain production increase targets stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program last year, are even more enthusiastic, and they are prepared to further increase grain production on the basis of their existing achievements. Last year, the average grain yield per mu in Gaoling County reached 402 catties. The agricultural cooperatives in this county plan to irrigate 99% of the county's land this winter and next spring, and plan to exceed this figure in grain yield per mu next year. More than 1,000 rural cadres and agricultural cooperative members attending a meeting in Chang'an County expressed their determination to over fulfill the grain and cotton targets mentioned in the program. The Lianmeng Er Cooperative in the suburbs of Xianyang City plans to achieve a grain yield of 440 catties per mu next year. In order to accomplish this task, in addition to extending the irrigation canals to irrigate 300 mu of land and using 24 rubber-wheeled carts to haul manure from nearby organizations and factories, they also plan to organize more than 100 laborers to go out and earn fertilizer by building walls and kangs for others during the slack winter season, and strive to apply topdressing fertilizer to more than 2,000 mu of wheat fields next spring. Thirty-seven agricultural cooperatives in Dali County plan to expand public accumulation and vigorously carry out basic construction.

    陕西粮棉总产量十年将增一倍多
    省人民委员会通过一九五八至一九六七年农业发展规划草案
    新华社西安1日电　陕西省人民委员会委员会议在10月30日通过了陕西省1958到1967年农业经济发展规划（草案）。这个规划（草案）提出在今后十年内（即第二、第三个五年计划期间）全省农业发展方针是：以增产粮食为主，按比例积极地发展棉花、油料等经济作物，大量发展畜牧业，因地制宜地发展林业、土特产和农村副业生产，全面的发展农业的多种经济。按照规划（草案）提出的农林牧生产发展指标，到1967年，全省粮食总产量将达到一百八十一点六亿斤，比1957年增加111．9％。秦岭以北地区的关中、陕北川道和灌区的耕地，平均每亩要达到四百斤；秦岭以南的平川、水田区的耕地平均每亩要达到九百斤；其中风沙区、土地瘠薄、水土流失严重和高山区以及浅山丘陵区平均每亩要分别达到一百一十五斤、二百五十五斤、三百一十斤。全省棉花总产量四百五十三万担（皮棉），比1957年增加126．5％，每亩平均产量达到九十点六斤，增加115．2％。大家畜增加59．4％，羊增加117．2％，猪增加235．6％。十年内全省计划造林二千六百五十四点三万亩，全省除榆林专区的沙漠地带外，将基本上实现绿化。这个规划（草案）并将报国务院批准。
    陕西省在制订这个方案之前，省领导机关和专署以及重点县都成立了规划办公室，抽调了七百多名干部深入到三十一个乡和七十七个社进行了典型调查摸底和具体规划工作，之后，根据材料分地区专业进行分析研究，综合平衡。
    据新华社西安2日电　陕西省关中平原四十多个县、市许多农业社的干部和社员，在阅读和学习了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）后，兴奋地奔走相告。许多农业社的干部和社员认真地逐条学习了这个纲要后，向社会主义道路前进的信心倍增。
    许多农业社在学习农业发展纲要的过程中，都根据自己农业社的具体情况，修订或制订了增产计划。去年已经完成农业发展纲要规定十二年粮食增产指标的长安、高陵两个县和西安市郊区的农民劲头更大，他们准备在既有的成绩基础上把粮食增产再提高一步。高陵县去年粮食产量平均每亩达到四百零二斤，这个县的农业社计划在今冬明春把全县99％的土地都能浇上水，计划明年粮食每亩产量要超过这个数字。正在长安县参加会议的一千多农村干部和农业社员，表示要超额完成纲要上所提的粮棉指标。咸阳市郊区联盟二社，计划明年全社的粮食产量每亩达到四百四十斤。为了完成这个任务，他们计划除延长灌溉渠道扩灌三百亩地，用二十四辆胶轮车到附近机关、工厂拉粪外，还计划在今冬农闲时组织一百多个劳力出外用给别人打墙换炕的办法给社内积攒肥料，争取明春使两千多亩麦田都施一次追肥。大荔县有三十七个农业社计划扩大公共积累，大力进行基本建设。
