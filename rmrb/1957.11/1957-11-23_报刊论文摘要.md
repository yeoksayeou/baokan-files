    The Party Can Lead Everything
    Revisionists believe that the Party does not understand science, technology, literature, art, and various professions, and therefore cannot lead. They deny that the Party must lead everything, and deny the Party's leading role in the socialist revolution, especially in socialist construction. The Party's leading role is mainly and primarily manifested in political and ideological leadership and organizational and administrative leadership. As for academic issues, the Party's leading policy is to solve them through the "Hundred Schools of Thought" in academic circles and objective practice. If the Party committee is required to abandon political and ideological leadership and organizational leadership and conduct specific technical guidance and business guidance for various professions, it would be tantamount to abolishing the Party's most important leading role. The Party mainly realizes leadership in political ideology, in lines, principles, policies, and plans, and in cultivating and allocating cadres, and in organizing all aspects of strength to cooperate and coordinate with each other. These are all common things. These common tasks all require unified leadership to solve. The Party is most capable of distinguishing right from wrong, and the Party can most resolutely safeguard socialist interests. Safeguarding socialist interests and violating socialist interests are the most fundamental issues in implementing everything. On this issue, the Party encourages and supports all advanced new things that are beneficial to socialism, and criticizes and opposes all backward and reactionary things that are detrimental to socialism. Especially during the transition period, when the struggle between two roads and two ideological systems runs through everything, it is even more necessary to have the Party's leadership to achieve socialist victory. Otherwise, the political direction will be lost. To safeguard the Party's leadership is to safeguard the fundamental interests of the people.

    Adhere to the Class Line of Higher Education
    The historical experience of the Soviet Union proves that only after the proletariat has seized power can it form its own intelligentsia, and China is the same. Before the working class has seized power, it is impossible to form its own intelligentsia, because in the old society, the ruling class built a copper wall and iron barrier between the working people and scientific knowledge, and the working people had no right to education at all. In the new society under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working people have become the masters of their own country, and higher education provides the working people with opportunities to learn scientific knowledge. The fundamental difference between capitalist and socialist higher education directions is that the former wants to cultivate slaves loyal to the interests of the exploiting class, while the latter wants to cultivate intellectuals of the working class who are loyal to the socialist cause. Judging from the experience of the anti-rightist struggle, to ensure that this socialist direction is not tampered with or deteriorated, we must first strengthen the Party's leadership, which is beyond doubt.

    报刊论文摘要
    党能够领导一切
    修正主义者认为党不懂科学、技术，不懂文艺，不懂各种专业等等，因而不能领导。他们否认党必须领导一切，否认党在社会主义革命，特别是在社会主义建设中的领导作用。党的领导作用主要和首先表现在政治思想领导与组织行政领导上。至于学术问题，党的领导方针是通过学术界的“百家争鸣”与客观实践去解决。如果要求党委放弃政治思想领导与组织领导而去对各种专业进行具体的技术指导，业务指导，那就等于取消了党的最主要的领导作用。党主要是在政治思想上，在路线、方针、政策、计划上实现领导，在培养和分配干部的问题上、在组织各方面力量互相配合协调上实现领导。这些都是共同性的东西。这些共同性的工作，都是需要统一领导才能解决的问题。党最能辨别大是大非，党能最坚决地维护社会主义利益。维护社会主义利益与违反社会主义利益是贯彻一切的最根本的问题，党在这个问题上是鼓励、支持一切先进的有利于社会主义的新事物，批判和反对一切不利于社会主义的落后的和反动的东西。特别是在过渡时期，贯串着两条道路两个思想体系的斗争，那就更需要有党的领导，才能取得社会主义的胜利。否则就会迷失政治方向。维护党的领导就是维护人民群众最根本的利益。

    坚持高等教育的阶级路线
    苏联的历史经验证明，只是无产阶级掌握政权以后才能形成自己的知识界，中国也是这样的。在工人阶级还没有掌握政权的时候，自己的知识界是没有可能形成的，因为在旧社会，统治阶级给劳动人民与科学知识之间筑下了铜墙铁壁，劳动人民根本没有受教育的权利。在共产党领导下的新社会，劳动人民成为自己国家的主人，高等教育给劳动人民提供了学习科学知识的机会。资本主义与社会主义高等教育方向的根本分歧，就是：前者要培养忠于剥削阶级利益的奴仆，后者要培养忠于社会主义事业的工人阶级的知识分子。从反右派斗争的经验来看，要保证这个社会主义的方向不被篡改，不变质，就要首先加强党的领导，这是无可怀疑的。（摘自1957年“教学与研究”第十一期胡锡奎：“继续学习苏联先进经验，坚持高等教育的阶级路线和社会主义方向”）
