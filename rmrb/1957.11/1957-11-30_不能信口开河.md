A responsible comrade from a certain bureau of the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee, when mobilizing cadres to go to the countryside to participate in physical labor, said: "The countryside has green hills and clear waters, fresh air... everywhere there are hot springs like Tanggangzi." This statement is obviously wrong. Everyone knows that rural life and agricultural labor are relatively difficult today, which is an undeniable fact. The purpose of cadres going to lower levels is to temper themselves in a relatively difficult life and labor, and definitely not to let them get any comfortable enjoyment. This point, for those cadres with high socialist consciousness and determination to transform themselves, does not need to be concealed. Even for those who are afraid of the hardships of rural life and hard labor, it should be made clear to them so that they have sufficient mental preparation. Mobilizing cadres to go to lower levels should actively carry out ideological work. Making irresponsible remarks and irresponsibly "beautifying" the reality of today's countryside is not only of no help, but is also greatly harmful!

    不能信口开河
    辽宁省人民委员会某局负责同志，在动员干部下放到农村去参加体力劳动时说：“农村是青山绿水，空气新鲜……，到处是像汤岗子一样的温泉。”这种说法，显然是错误的。谁都知道，今天农村生活和农业劳动都比较艰苦，还是无可否认的事实。干部下放正是要他们在比较艰苦的生活和劳动中进行锻炼，而决不是让他们去得到什么舒适的享受。这一点，对于那些社会主义觉悟高、有决心改造自己的干部，固然用不着隐讳，就是对于那些害怕农村生活苦、害怕艰苦劳动的人，也应该说清楚，使他们有充分的精神准备。动员干部下放，应该积极地做思想工作，信口开河、不负责任地“美化”今天农村的现实，不仅无补于事，而且是大有害处的！
