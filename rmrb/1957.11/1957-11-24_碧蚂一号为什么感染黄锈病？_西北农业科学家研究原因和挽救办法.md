Why is Bima No. 1 Infected with Wheat Stripe Rust?
Northwest Agricultural Scientists Study Causes and Remedial Measures

(This newspaper dispatch) Our newspaper reports: The Bima No. 1 wheat variety, known for its strong resistance to stripe rust, has been widely infected with rust disease in the Shaanxi region this year. Shaanxi has achieved bumper harvests every year since the full-scale promotion of Bima No. 1 in 1952, but this year's widespread rust disease has reduced production by about 15%. Of the more than 23.47 million mu of wheat fields in Shaanxi, Bima No. 1 accounts for 16 million mu. This excellent variety has also been widely promoted throughout the country, covering approximately 35 million mu in total. Therefore, researching the causes of Bima No. 1's rust infection and finding remedial measures is a major issue of great concern to the people of Shaanxi and many wheat-producing areas across the country. Scientists at the Northwest Agricultural College and the Northwest Agricultural Science Institute are currently working diligently on this research. Recently, this newspaper's reporter in Shaanxi invited several scientists to a forum at the Northwest Agricultural College to discuss their research on this issue.

Participants in the forum included Professor Zhao Hongzhang, Professor Qiu Yuan, Professor Sun Wanxiang (the main breeders of Bima No. 1), Mr. Wang Yucheng and Mr. Xu Zhilu from the Northwest Agricultural Science Institute, and Vice President Kang Di of the Northwest Agricultural College.

Regarding the causes of Bima No. 1's rust infection, the scientists at the forum unanimously agreed that the main reason is that the stripe rust strain has changed, rather than the Bima No. 1 variety degenerating. Regarding the change in the strain, there are two possibilities: one is that the strain has undergone adaptive mutations in the struggle for survival, becoming a new strain capable of infecting Bima No. 1; the other is that the strain infecting Bima No. 1 already existed and developed with the expansion of Bima No. 1's planting area. However, which possibility is more likely is still under research. Although the variety itself may have degenerated to some extent, no reliable evidence has been obtained so far, especially no evidence to support that variety degeneration is the cause of rust infection.

The scientists unanimously agreed that, based on the experience of various countries at home and abroad, no excellent rust-resistant variety can remain rust-resistant and effective forever. Therefore, it is necessary to change the practice of promoting a single variety and sow other excellent varieties according to local conditions. Bima No. 1 has been promoted very widely across the country, and scientists hope that other regions should pay attention to this sooner rather than later.

The scientists believe that the immediate major tasks are, first, to strive to cultivate new varieties. The No. 6028 new variety they have cultivated has been promoted on a larger scale in Guanzhong, proving to be more rust-resistant than Bima No. 1, but its drought resistance, cold resistance, and quality are not as good as Bima No. 1. The No. 612 and No. 134, which have been bred but not yet extensively tested, are also more rust-resistant than Bima No. 1, but their cold and drought resistance is weaker, and their maturity period is later. Currently, they are focusing on backcrossing Bima No. 1 with other rust-resistant varieties, hoping to produce a new variety that retains the advantages of Bima No. 1 in drought and cold resistance while enhancing its rust resistance. However, this backcrossing can only be carried out for two generations a year in greenhouse experiments. Even if it succeeds, it will take several years before it can be widely promoted. Scientists also suggested that all regions should pay attention to promoting excellent local varieties, such as "Hong Datou," which also showed rust resistance in this instance.

Second, gradually reduce the planting area of Bima No. 1, especially in low-temperature areas that are conducive to the growth of rust fungi. No. 6028 or other rust-resistant varieties can be planted first.

Third, the practice of emphasizing "seeds are everything" and neglecting cultivation should be changed. First of all, attention should be paid to selecting large, plump seeds. Some people believe that as long as it is Bima No. 1, there is no need to select seeds, which is incorrect. Secondly, after the wheat seedlings turn green in the coming spring, careful inspection should be carried out. If rust fungi are found, pesticides should be used for prevention and control as soon as possible. Furthermore, attention should be paid to weeding the wheat, especially after rain, because hoeing the ground can loosen the soil and prevent moisture, which is not conducive to the breeding of rust fungi.

Fourth, find out where the rust fungi overwinter. The temperature in Shaanxi is high in summer, and the rust fungi cannot survive. According to investigations, the rust fungi that parasitize winter wheat before the summer harvest are blown by the wind to Gansu and Qinghai to overwinter, parasitizing wild wheat and spring wheat, and then blown back to Shaanxi in autumn. Therefore, if spring wheat in Gansu and Qinghai also has rust disease this year, or if there is more rain in the Guanzhong area this autumn and next spring (which is suitable for the breeding of pathogens), the possibility of Shaanxi wheat being re-infected with rust disease next year is even greater. Therefore, agricultural scientists in Shaanxi are studying how to work together with agricultural scientists in Gansu to carry out prevention and control in the central areas of the outbreak to reduce the harm.

Fifth, learn from the Soviet experience and establish a system for promoting excellent varieties, so that the work of promoting improved varieties in the future is closely integrated with scientific research work.

At this forum, the scientists expressed their determination to intensify research and experimental work, and strive to solve the wheat rust problem in Shaanxi as soon as possible.

### 碧蚂一号为什么感染黄锈病？  西北农业科学家研究原因和挽救办法

    碧蚂一号为什么感染黄锈病？
    西北农业科学家研究原因和挽救办法
    本报讯　抵抗黄锈病能力很强的小麦良种碧蚂一号，今年在陕西地区普遍感染了锈病；陕西从1952年全面推广碧蚂一号以来年年丰产，今年却因锈病普遍减产15％左右。全陕西二千三百四十七万多亩麦田中，其中碧蚂一号占一千六百万亩，而且这一优良品种在全国推行也广，大约共三千五百多万亩。因而研究碧蚂一号感染锈病的原因和挽救的办法，就是全陕西以至全国很多麦产区人民十分关怀的重大问题。西北农业学院和西北农业科学研究所的科学家们目前正在努力从事这一研究工作。日前本报驻陕西记者在西北农学院邀请几位科学家座谈了他们对这一问题的研究情况。
    参加这次座谈会的有碧蚂一号的主要培育人赵洪章教授、仇元教授、孙万祥教授、西北农业科学研究所王玉成和许志鲁先生、西北农学院康迪副院长。
    关于碧蚂一号感染锈病的原因，参加座谈会的科学家们一致认为，主要原因是锈病菌种情况发生了改变，不是碧蚂一号品种退化。关于菌种的改变，有两种可能：一是菌种在生存斗争中通过适应性的变异，变为新的对碧蚂一号有侵染力的菌种；一是侵染碧蚂一号的菌种原来就已存在，随着碧蚂一号推广面积的扩大而发展起来。但究竟是那种可能性大，正在研究中。至于品种本身虽可能有所退化，目前还未得到任何可靠的证明，尤其是以品种退化作为感染锈病的原因更未得到任何证明。
    科学家们一致的意见，认为任何一种优良的抗锈品种，根据中外各国的经验，都不能永远抗锈、一劳永逸。因而必须改变推行单一品种的办法，应该因地制宜地播种一些其他的优良品种。目前碧蚂一号在全国推广得很宽，科学家们希望其他地区应该早些提起注意。
    科学家们认为，摆在眼前的重大任务，第一是努力培育新品种。他们培育的六○二八号新品种，已经在关中较大范围内推广，证明抗锈力比碧蚂一号强，但抗旱力、抗寒力和品质都不如碧蚂一号。已经培育出尚未大量试种的六一二和一三四号，抗锈力也比碧蚂一号强，但抗寒抗旱力弱，成熟期也较晚。目前他们正在着重用碧蚂一号和其他抗锈品种进行回交，希望能产生一种新品种，既保存碧蚂一号抗旱抗寒的优点，又增强其抗锈的能力，但这种回交，在温室内试验，一年也只能进行两代，如果能够成功，也要几年后才能大量推广。科学家们还提出，希望各地应注意推广优良的农家品种，如“红大头”等，在这次也表现了抗锈能力。
    第二，逐步缩小碧蚂一号的播种面积，特别是在有利于锈菌生长的低温地区，可以先改种六○二八号或其他抗锈品种。
    第三，应改变“种子万能”忽视栽培的作法。首先应注意选肥大的籽种，有些人认为只要是碧蚂一号就不必选种，这样作是不对的。其次是在麦苗明春返青以后应注意进行仔细检查，如发现锈菌，应早用药剂防治。再次是要注意锄麦，特别是下雨以后，锄地可以松土防潮，不利于锈菌滋生。
    第四，找寻锈菌过夏的地方。陕西夏天温度较高，锈菌不能生存。据已经查明，夏收以前在冬小麦上寄生的锈菌就随风吹到甘肃、青海去过夏，寄生在野生麦和春麦上，到秋天又随风吹回陕西。所以如果甘肃青海地区今年春麦也有锈病，或者今年秋季和明年春季关中地区雨水多（适于病菌繁殖），明年陕西麦子重新感受锈病的可能性就更大。因而陕西的农业科学家们正在研究如何和甘肃的农业科学家共同努力在发病的中心地区进行防治，以减轻病害。
    第五，学习苏联经验，建立推广优良品种的制度，使今后推广良种工作密切和科学研究工作结合。
      在这次座谈会上，科学家们表示决心加紧研究和试验工作，努力使陕西小麦锈病问题得到早日解决。
