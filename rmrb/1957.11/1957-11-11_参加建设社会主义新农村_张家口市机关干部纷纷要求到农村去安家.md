    Participating in the Construction of a New Socialist Countryside
    Zhangjiakou City Government Cadres Eagerly Request to Settle Down in Rural Areas

    (Report from Hebei Daily) It is reported that a large number of cadres from the Zhangjiakou City-level government agencies are requesting approval from their leaders to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor. By October 30th, 595 cadres from various city agencies had already signed up. Some wrote big-character posters three or four times, repeatedly requesting approval from their leaders. In many units, signing up to participate in production in the countryside has become a trend.

    Many cadres from working-class families took the lead in signing up. In group meetings and on big-character posters, they contrasted their past suffering with their current lives, explaining that "without enduring the bitterness of bitterness, it is difficult to obtain the sweetness of sweetness." This has great educational significance for cadres who have not experienced a poor life in the past and do not understand the likes and dislikes of the masses. Yang Chunlin, a party member cadre from the Municipal Intermediate People's Court, recalled his miserable life of begging for food at a discussion, saying, "Our current happy life is the result of the Party's leadership of the masses. I want to respond to the Party's call and build a new socialist countryside." He signed up on the spot to go to the countryside to work. In the evening, he discussed it with his wife, and they decided that they must go to the countryside. Gao Guilan from the Finance Bureau wrote a letter of determination, which included three guarantees: 1. I will definitely concentrate on production in the countryside and play an exemplary role in labor; 2. I will humbly learn from the peasants and eat, live, and work with them; 3. I guarantee not to fall behind. In these units, many responsible comrades also signed up. Yang Leizhi and Xu Chunxing, Secretaries of the Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, jointly wrote a big-character poster requesting to go to the grassroots level for training.

    The cadres who have signed up to participate in labor in the countryside have already made preparations. Many people have conducted ideological education for their families to smooth out their thoughts. After Comrade Liu Guangran from the Municipal Propaganda Department signed up, he explained the significance of working in the countryside to his wife. After ideological mobilization, the couple reached a consensus and decided to go to the countryside to settle down and produce as soon as they were approved. In order to enable the cadres who go to the countryside to produce to have some understanding of the current rural situation, the Municipal People's Committee also organized some cadres to visit agricultural cooperatives such as Yulinbao in the suburbs. Some cadres also used their lunch breaks to go to agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs to learn about the situation. (Attached pictures)

    Shi Hongyan is one of the thousands of government cadres in Beijing who have been sent to the countryside. After a short period of field activities, he deeply realized that growing crops is not a simple skill or knowledge, and fundamentally changed his original erroneous idea that labor is simple. He is determined to learn from the old peasants. (Xinhua News Agency reporter An Kang)

    Top picture: "The hoe should be held like this." The production team leader told him several times that it was not right, so he held him and taught him. If it didn't work once, try again.

    参加建设社会主义新农村
    张家口市机关干部纷纷要求到农村去安家
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：张家口市级机关的广大干部，纷纷要求领导上批准自己去农村参加农业劳动。到10月30日，全市各机关已有五百九十五名干部报了名。有的一连写三、四次大字报，一再要求领导上批准。在许多单位中，报名要求去农村参加生产成了风气。
    好多出身于劳动人民家庭的干部，在报名时起了带头作用。他们在小组会上和大字报上，把过去的痛苦生活同现在的生活对比，说明“不受苦中苦，难得甜中甜”。这对过去没有经历过穷苦的生活、不了解群众喜恶什么的干部，教育意义很大。市中级人民法院的党员干部杨春林，在座谈会上回忆了过去讨饭吃的悲惨生活，他说：“现在的幸福生活是党领导群众得来的，我要响应党的号召，去建设社会主义新农村。”他当场报名要到农村去劳动。晚上，他又和爱人商量好，一定要到农村去。财政局高桂兰写了决心书，上面提了三条保证：一、去农村一定要安心生产，在劳动中起模范作用；二、虚心向农民学习，与农民同吃、同住、同劳动；三、保证不掉队。在这些单位中，好多负责同志也报了名。中共张家口市委书记处书记杨磊之、徐纯性等同志，联名写大字报要求到基层去锻炼。
    报名去农村参加劳动的干部，已经作好了准备。好多人对家属进行了思想教育，打通家属的思想。市委宣传部刘光然同志报名后，就和爱人讲解下乡劳动的意义，经过思想动员后，夫妇思想一致，决定几时批准几时就到农村去安家生产。为了使下乡生产的干部对农村现状有所了解，市人民委员会还组织了一部分干部，到郊区榆林堡等农业社参观。有些干部也利用中午休息时间，到郊区农业社去了解情况。（附图片）
