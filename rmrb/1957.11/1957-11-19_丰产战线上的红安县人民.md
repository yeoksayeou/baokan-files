This year in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, every commune has increased production, and there is a bumper harvest in everything. For a revolutionary old base area that has suffered long-term devastation by the enemy, this is an exciting thing. We recently visited here, and the determination and enthusiasm of the people here to strive for increased agricultural production and build socialism left a deep impression on us.

Everybody Offers Ideas, Everyone Contributes

When we came into contact with the people of Hong'an County, we often heard people say, "We must do our part for socialism." This sentence has become a huge driving force for inspiring the people of Hong'an County to move forward by leaps and bounds in agricultural production. Those old farmers with rich production experience have made outstanding contributions to this year's production.

In late May this year, the rice seedlings had been transplanted for some time, but the seedlings in many places in the county were growing yellow and weak. At this time, the old farmers actively offered advice and quickly changed this worrying situation. In Hongguang Third Agricultural Cooperative of Liangdao Township, nearly 300 mu of the 800 mu of rice was not growing well. The old farmers Geng Zhui Gang and others, seeing this situation, offered the cooperative ten good ideas, such as applying topdressing and eliminating insects, which improved the seedlings. After the autumn harvest, it was calculated that the total yield increased by 70,000 jin. During peanut sowing this year, the old farmer Jin Kongtang of Tainan Township passed on his experience of achieving high yields every year by increasing base fertilizer and topdressing, changing the habit of not applying fertilizer in the whole township, and enabling the township to create a large-scale high-yield record this year, with an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu in three agricultural cooperatives. Xinzhai Township, after accepting the suggestion of 72-year-old farmer Song Jifu, planted late rice in more than 200 mu of empty fields near reservoirs and ponds throughout the township, and harvested more than 18,000 jin of grain this year.

Rivers Change Course, Hills Lower Their Heads

Since the beginning of autumn, the county has not had a single heavy rain. Eighty days of continuous drought seriously threatened the growth of crops. Under this serious situation, the people of Hong'an County did not flinch, and a tense fight against drought quickly unfolded throughout the county. The fields were full of people, including: cadres who insisted on working despite illness, young people who rushed to where there were difficulties, elderly people with white hair watering with ladles, and cooperative members who were blind and still participated in water lifting. In those unusual days, people conquered this year's rare drought with this tenacious fighting spirit.

This is a story we heard not long after arriving in Hong'an County. In early September, the ponds in Shuiyan Township dried up, the small river dried up, and large areas of crops were withering before their eyes. At this tense moment, more than 300 young activists in the township spent three days and three nights building a 50-zhang long, 8-chi high, and 1-zhang 5-chi wide water-blocking dam on a large river within the county. More than 3,500 people from the township were mobilized, along with more than 750 waterwheels, lined up for more than ten li, and stubbornly moved the water from the big river to the small river, and then from the small river to the ponds and fields, relieving the threat of drought to the entire township.

This heroic spirit of overcoming natural disasters also enabled the people of the county to overcome the difficulty of lacking fertilizer. They collected leaves, grass, and duckweed to accumulate a large amount of green manure, so that the rice seedlings, which were originally growing yellow and weak, gradually became strong after topdressing.

Thrifty Housekeeping, Loving the Cooperative Like Home

The people of Hong'an County, who have come out of difficult times, still maintain the excellent traditions of the past. This year, although the county has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production, people are still thrifty and hardworking. When reporters visited here, they saw that many families' meals were mixed with coarse grains and vegetables. It is understood that in order to save staple grains, they used almost all the ridges and edges of the fields to plant sorghum, mud beans and other coarse grain crops, and also opened up many wastelands to plant a large number of pumpkins, cabbage, radishes, etc. This year, the county harvested 4 million jin of coarse grains alone, plus a wide variety of vegetables, which are estimated to save 7 million jin of staple grains.

The county has also made great achievements in saving feed. Many cooperative members found tricks and tapped potential, collecting eighty or ninety kinds of wild feed to feed pigs. Zaolin Township raised more than 4,400 pigs this year, relying entirely on wild vegetables, water chestnut seedlings and other feeds. In areas with less wild feed, cooperative members dried and ground sweet potato stalks and peanut stalks into powder to feed pigs. The reporter once visited Liu Guoqing, a member of the Changchun Agricultural Cooperative. This old woman, who is nearly fifty years old, has sold a total of 28 pigs to the state and the cooperative this year, and still has 19 pigs at home. She often does not care about fatigue and goes to the mountains and fields to collect soybean leaves, wild vegetables, tree leaves, etc. as feed, thus saving a lot of grain. She also opened up wasteland on the hillside and planted more than ten kinds of vegetables, mixing some pumpkins, cabbage and radishes in every meal, three times a day. The saved food, in addition to leaving a portion in reserve for drought prevention, is also sold to the state for more than 200 jin.

Xu Zhengxiu, who has persisted in the revolution for 30 years and is called "Glorious Mother" by the people of Hong'an County, is 71 years old this year, but she still insists on participating in labor. During the busy farming season, she goes to the fields with young people and also leads women to carry out labor competitions. She often says to people, "In the past, we shed blood and sacrificed ourselves for the revolution, and now we have to work more actively to build socialism."

Maintain Glory, Carry Forward Glory

Hong'an County is one of the earliest revolutionary old base areas in China. In the difficult years before liberation, Hong'an County was devastated by the enemy and was desolate everywhere. After liberation, people rebuilt their homes with the support and help of the state. After the realization of agricultural cooperation, the face of this area has greatly changed. People now sing their lives like this: "Huaguoshan, land of rice and grain, cattle and sheep in groups, pigs in pens, chickens and ducks in the bay, domestic fish in ponds and weirs, socialist life is happy and beautiful." However, the people of Hong'an County know very well how to cherish their beautiful scenery. While the crops were not yet harvested, many agricultural cooperatives had already made plans for handing over public grain and surplus grain. As soon as the grain was in hand, they dried it and winnowed it, and sold the first-class grain to the state. In order to achieve "no bad grain out of the cooperative, good grain into the granary," many cooperative members of Anhe Agricultural Cooperative in Tianma Township screened the grain that had been dried and winnowed, again and again, overnight. Fifteen agricultural cooperatives in Zhaohe Township put forward the slogan of not sending wet grain, sprouted grain, shriveled grain, insect grain, and rotten grain, and launched a grain delivery competition. The county completed the task of 340,000 jin of public grain ahead of schedule in just two days.

    丰产战线上的红安县人民
    新华社记者　田庄、方堤
    湖北省红安县今年在农业生产上是社社增产，样样丰收。对于一个曾经遭受过敌人长期摧残的革命老根据地来说，这是一件令人振奋的事情。最近我们到这里作了访问，这里人民争取农业增产和建设社会主义的决心和热情，给我们留下深刻的印象。
  人人献计，个个出力
    我们跟红安县的人们接触时，常听到人们说：“要为社会主义出把力”。这句话成为鼓舞红安县人民在农业生产上大踏步前进的巨大动力。那些有着丰富生产经验的老农们，对今年的生产更是作出了出色的贡献。
    今年5月下旬，水稻已经插秧好些时候了，但是这个县不少地方的秧禾，却长得又黄又弱。就在这个时候，老农们积极献计，迅速地改变了这种令人烦恼的局面。两道乡红光第三农业社八百多亩水稻中当时有将近三百亩生长得不好，老农耿咀刚等看到这种情况，就向社里献了追肥、除虫等十条好计，使秧苗变好了，秋收后一计算，总共增产了七万斤。台南乡老农金孔堂在今年花生播种时，传授了过去自己由于增施底肥、追肥年年高产的经验，改变了全乡不施肥的习惯，使这个乡今年创造了大面积高额丰产记录，其中有三个农业社每亩平均产量达到了一千斤。新寨乡由于接受了七十二岁老农宋继富的建议，在全乡水库、塘堰附近的二百多亩空田里，栽种了晚稻，今年多收了一万八千多斤粮食。
  河水移道，山岗低头
    入秋以来，这个县没有下过一场透雨。持续八十天的干旱，严重地威胁着庄稼的成长。在这种严重的情况下，红安县人民没有畏缩，一场紧张的抗旱斗争便在全县迅速地展开。田野里到处是人，他们中间有：抱病坚持工作的干部，那里有困难就赶到那里的青年，鬓发皆白拿着瓢浇水的老人，和双目失明还参加车水的社员。在那些不寻常的日子里，人们就是用这种坚韧不拔的斗争精神，征服了今年罕见的干旱。
    这是我们到红安县不久听到的一个故事。9月上旬，水岩乡的水塘干涸了，小河绝流了，大片大片的庄稼眼看着枯萎了。在这个紧张的时刻，全乡三百多个青年积极分子，整整花了三天三夜的时间，在县境内的一条大河上筑了一道五十丈长、八尺高、一丈五尺宽的拦水大坝。全乡出动了三千五百多人，七百五十多部水车，摆了十多里路长，硬是把大河水搬到了小河里，又从小河里搬到塘里、田里，解除了全乡干旱的威胁。
    这种战胜自然灾害的英雄气概，还使这个县的人民克服了缺乏肥料的困难。他们捡树叶、青草，捞浮萍积了大量绿肥，使原来长得黄弱的禾苗，经过施追肥以后慢慢茁壮起来了。
  勤俭持家，爱社如家
    从艰难岁月中走过来的红安县人民，至今还保持着过去的优良传统。今年，这个县虽然在农业生产上取得了空前大丰收，但是人们仍然是克勤克俭。记者在访问这里时，看到许多人家的饭里掺有杂粮和蔬菜，据了解，他们为了节省主粮，几乎把所有的田埂地边都利用起来，种植了高粱、泥豆等杂粮作物，还开了许多荒地，种植了大量南瓜、白菜、萝卜等。这个县今年仅收的杂粮就有四百万斤，加上种类繁多的蔬菜，估计能够节省主粮七百万斤。
    这个县节省饲料的成绩也很大。许多农业社社员找窍门、挖潜力，采集了八、九十种野生饲料用来喂猪。枣林乡今年喂猪四千四百多头，全靠野菜、菱角禾等作饲料。野生饲料较少的地方，社员们就把红薯梗、花生秆晒干磨成粉喂猪。记者曾经访问了长春农业社社员刘国清。这位将近五十岁的老婆婆，今年已经卖给国家和合作社共二十八头猪，家里还养有十九头猪。她常常不顾疲累到山上、地里采集豆叶、野菜、树叶等作饲料，因此节省下许多粮食。她还在山坡上开了荒地，种植了十多种蔬菜，每天三顿饭、顿顿都掺些南瓜、白菜和萝卜，这样节省下来的口粮，除留一部分储备防荒以外，还卖给国家二百多斤。
    坚持革命三十年，被红安县人民称为“光荣妈妈”的徐正修，今年已经七十一岁了，但是她仍坚持参加劳动。农忙时，她跟年轻人一块下田，并且还带领着妇女开展劳动竞赛。她常常对人说：“过去流血牺牲还革命，现在建设社会主义更得积极工作。”
  保持光荣，发扬光荣
    红安县是我国最早的革命老根据地之一。在解放以前艰苦斗争的年代里，红安县被敌人摧残得到处荒芜凄凉。解放以后，人们才在国家的扶持、帮助下，重建家园。实现了农业合作化以后，这个地区的面貌才大大改观。人们现在这样歌唱着自己的生活：“花果山，米粮川，牛羊成群猪满圈，鸡鸭满湾，家鱼满塘堰，社会主义生活幸福又美满。”但是，红安县人民十分懂得珍惜自己美好的光景。还在庄稼没有收割的时候，许多农业社就已作好交售公粮、余粮的计划。粮食一到手，他们便晒干扬净，把头等粮卖给国家。天马乡安河农业社为了作到“坏粮不出社，好粮送进仓”，许多社员连夜把已经晒干扬净的粮食，又筛得干干净净；赵河乡十五个农业社提出不送湿谷、芽谷、瘪谷、虫谷、烂谷的口号，展开了送粮竞赛，全县只用了两天时间，就超额完成了三十四万斤的公粮任务。
