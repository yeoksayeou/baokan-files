Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 1st November: Shandong Province is organizing an unprecedented upsurge in agricultural production.

　　Ideological and organizational work to launch this production upsurge has been fully unfolded throughout the province. Local Party committees have successively convened expanded meetings of the local committees or meetings of county Party secretaries; expanded meetings of county Party committees or three-level cadre meetings are currently being held in various counties, and some counties have already concluded their meetings. At these meetings, the vast number of cadres, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, used debate to launch a struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking. These meetings also discussed the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and provincial plans, and revised or re-formulated plans for their respective regions. According to recent information, the plans of all local committees have been completed, about 80% of the counties have made plans, and the plans of various townships and communes are also being actively formulated.

　　At the same time, Party committees at all levels and relevant departments have sent large numbers of capable cadres to conduct in-depth investigations and studies of typical agricultural cooperatives that have reached or exceeded the production level of local prosperous middle peasants by changing natural conditions, and systematically summarize their experience in promoting the great leap forward in production, so as to promote it comprehensively. In addition to the province organizing visits to mountainous production and construction, soil improvement, and pig raising and manure accumulation, various counties and regions are also conducting various visits and comparisons.

　　Various technical training courses are being opened in various places to train technicians in water conservancy, breeding, and soil improvement for agricultural cooperatives. It is expected that a technical army of more than one million people will emerge in the province during the production upsurge.

　　The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee recently jointly issued instructions on implementing the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council "on launching a large-scale farmland water conservancy and manure accumulation movement in the winter and spring of this year and next year." The Shandong Provincial People's Committee and the Shandong People's Broadcasting Station specially held a broadcast conference on November 25 to launch a winter production upsurge. In view of the imminent early arrival of the winter production upsurge in the province, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to advance the opening of the provincial congress of agricultural activists, which is aimed at organizing the provincial agricultural production upsurge, to November 3. Other relevant preparatory work is also being intensified.

    山东全力组织农业生产高潮
    全省范围内全面展开思想工作和组织工作
    新华社济南1日电　山东省正在组织一个规模空前的农业生产高潮。
    关于发动这次生产高潮的思想工作和组织工作，已经在全省范围内全面展开。各地委已先后召开了地委扩大会议或县委书记会议；各县的县委扩大会议或三级干部会议目前正在举行，有些县的会议已经结束。在这些会议上，广大干部根据党的三中全会精神，用辩论的方法，展开了对右倾保守思想的斗争。这些会议还讨论了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）和全省的规划，修订或重新制订了本地区的规划。据最近了解，目前各个地委的规划已经做好，约有80％的县已经做出规划，各乡、社的规划也正在积极制订中。
    与此同时，中共各级党委和各有关部门都派出大批得力干部，分别到那些由于改变自然条件，已经达到和超过当地富裕中农的生产水平的典型农业社，进行深入调查研究，系统地总结它们推动生产大跃进的经验，以使全面推广。目前除由省里组织了有关山区生产建设、改良土壤、养猪积肥等方面的参观以外，各县和各个地区之间也正在进行各种参观评比活动。
    各地正在开办各种技术训练班，分别为农业社训练水利、饲养和改良土壤等方面的技术人员，预计在生产高潮中全省将出现一支一百多万人的技术大军。
    中共山东省委和山东省人民委员会日前联合发出关于执行中共中央、国务院“关于今冬明春大规模地开展兴修农田水利和积肥运动的决定”的指示，山东省人民委员会和山东人民广播电台于本月25日特地举行掀起冬季生产高潮的广播会。鉴于全省冬季生产高潮即将提前到来，中共山东省委决定把以组织全省农业生产高潮为目的的全省农业积极分子大会提前到11月3日开幕。其它各项有关的准备工作也正加紧进行中。
