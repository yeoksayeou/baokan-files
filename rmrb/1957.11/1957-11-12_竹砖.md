    Bamboo Bricks
    Wen Chengxun
    (Seeing that China is rich in bamboo, Soviet experts created a kind of bamboo brick for us to use as elastic flooring in workshops, which has a lifespan several times longer than wooden bricks.)
    In the beautiful and prosperous Jiangnan, lush bamboo towers into the sky. A distinguished guest visited here, and the bamboo forest gave him creative inspiration! No longer fearing the expensive price of sandalwood, no longer fearing the cold and hard defects of cement, the expert overcame their difficulties, using plump bamboo stems to pave the ground with bricks. Strolling on this patterned floor, who wouldn't slow their steps gently? Although flowing footprints wear away her cheeks, the long river of time will not wash away the patterns in our hearts! Hard work not only created a kind of bamboo brick, ingenuity is more than just a road surface. From the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the shores of the South China Sea, where is there not an inscription of the pattern of friendship?

    竹砖
    温承训
    （苏联专家看到我国盛产竹材，为我们创制一种竹砖，做车间的弹性地面，比木砖寿命要长几倍。）在秀丽、富庶的江南，茂林修竹拔地参天，一位贵客曾到这里访问，竹林赠予他创造的灵感！再不怕紫檀木昂贵的身价，再不怕水门汀冷酷坚硬的缺陷，是专家摆脱了它们的刁难，用丰满的竹茎铺地做砖。漫步在这拼花的地面，谁不把脚步放得轻柔缓慢，流动的脚印虽然磨蚀她的面颊，时间的长河不会把心头的花纹冲淡！苦心不仅创造一种竹砖，精巧何止一方路面，从黑龙江畔到南海边，何处不铭志着友谊的图案？
