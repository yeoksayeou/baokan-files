Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 2nd: A recent article in "Izvestia" reported that the Soviet Union has created the world's first new-style house-building machine that can automatically lay bricks. After testing, it can be officially used to build houses. Using this machine to build a five-story building will only take fifty to sixty days. Building a prefabricated or panel-structured house without a frame will only take fourteen to eighteen days and nights. The operators of this new house-building machine are well protected, and they can work day and night regardless of wind, frost, rain, snow, hot weather, or severe cold.

The assembly of this new house-building machine began in July of this year. The machine is supported by two huge, sturdy iron mesh frames spaced twenty-seven meters apart. The house-building machine has thirty-three engines, automatic mortar conveying machinery, mortar-spreading scrapers, and so on. There are also three large iron hooks with a total lifting capacity of fifteen tons. The size of the machine is determined according to the volume of a standard five-story building. There are also searchlights for lighting at night.

"Izvestia" said that the house-building machine can automatically convey mortar and place it on the continuously rising walls, and then use a flat scraper to spread the mortar evenly and lay the bricks one by one. At this time, people only need to manually stack these bricks in the appropriate position. Large components are installed by large iron hooks.

Only a mixed work team of ten people is required to work on this amazing machine. The workers operate the machine in a working room, which can move freely back and forth, up and down, and can also change direction if needed. Therefore, the house-building machine does not need any building frames or scaffolding.

After being disassembled, the house-building machine can be transported by a truck with a trailer, which can be completed in thirty-two trips. After arriving at the new work area, it can be re-positioned with two cranes.

### 苏联制成世界第一架造房机  十个人五十天可建成一座五层大楼

    苏联制成世界第一架造房机
    十个人五十天可建成一座五层大楼
    据新华社莫斯科2日电　“消息报”最近刊载的一篇文章报道，苏联已制成世界第一架能自动砌砖的新式建造房屋的机器，经过试验后即可正式造房子。用这种机器来建造一座五层大楼，只需五十至六十天，建造一座装配式或壁板无构架住宅，只要十四至十八昼夜。这种新式造房机上操纵机器的工作人员被很好地防护着，不论风、霜、雨、雪和暑热酷寒都能昼夜不停地工作。
    这架新式造房机于今年7月间开始装配。机器由相距二十七公尺的两个巨大、坚固的铁制网状脚架支住。造房机上有三十三个发动机，有自动传送灰浆的机械，展平灰浆的刮刀等。还有三个总起重量达十五吨的大铁钩。机器的大小是按照标准的五层大楼的体积加以规定的。夜间还有探照灯照明。
    “消息报”说，造房机能将自动传送来的灰浆放在不断砌高的墙上，然后用平面刮刀将灰浆展平，将砖头一块接一块地砌上。这时，人们只要用手把这些砖块堆到适当的位置就行了。大块构件则由大铁钩安装。
    在这奇妙的机器上工作的只要有一个由十人组成的混合工作队就行了。工人们在工作间里操纵机器，这个工作间可自由地向前后上下移动，如有需要时还可转换方向。因此，造房机就不需要任何建筑架或脚手架了。
    造房机经拆散后，用一辆带拖车的卡车来运送，三十二次便可运完，到达新的工区后用两个起重机便可重新把它安置起来。
