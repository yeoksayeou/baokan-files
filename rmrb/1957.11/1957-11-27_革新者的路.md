    The Path of the Innovator
    Quan Yu
    Many people have already gone to become educated farmers, and even more have made grand vows to go to the countryside. However, there are also people who are taking the path of empty-headed innovators. A newspaper reported: "In Xingyang County, a high school graduate was asked by the township to be the deputy director of an agricultural cooperative, but he shook his head and said no; he was asked to be an accountant, and he left without even shaking his head." It is said that the reason why this person is so arrogant is because he has a "sense of superiority." He believes that he is already a "reformer" and "innovator" of the countryside, so why should he bother with such trivial matters? As for asking him to go to the fields and produce like ordinary farmers, it is not even worth mentioning, because he "cannot get along with farmers, cannot talk to them, and looks down on them."
    This kind of person feels "superior" simply because they have crammed a few years of books and filled half their belly with "knowledge." What they call "new" is probably nothing more than this. "Educated farmers" are, of course, "newer" than ordinary farmers; but what if they only have education and do not produce? Is it something to be proud of to be an "educated parasite"?
    Looking down on farmers is a common malady of intellectuals from the exploiting classes. This high school graduate has not learned this badly, but unfortunately, it is a bit outdated. To be honest, today's countryside does not need this kind of intellectual who rides on the heads of farmers. In fact, even in the past, this kind of person did not work in the countryside. When I was a child in the countryside, I saw a college student who returned from the city. At first, he talked about everything and was very arrogant, looking down on the country folks. However, later he showed his true colors. He could not only distinguish between chives or wheat seedlings, but even the newly grown buckwheat or cotton, sorghum or corn. This made even a child like me not admire him. Probably out of respect for intellectuals, the villagers did not make things too difficult for him, but they did give him some ridicule, and there was even a song: "Well-versed in hundreds of books, but cannot recognize the five grains; there is a way to heaven (to become an official), but no way to enter the earth." It is still used as a joke.
    Today's students are not as incompetent as in the past, but according to newspapers, there are still quite a few who do not know how to hold a hoe. Some even have to be taught by farmers themselves, just like teachers teaching elementary school students to write. I have never heard of elementary school students having any "sense of superiority" over teachers.
    No matter how well-packaged the "sense of superiority" is, it will inevitably be exposed when it comes to things like chives and wheat seedlings. There is no need to say more. The important question is, what path should those who aspire to be innovators in the countryside take?
    In the future, the task of "transforming" and "innovating" the countryside will ultimately be borne by "educated farmers." This includes farmers who have learned culture and people with culture who have gone to the countryside from the city. Therefore, it is entirely commendable to aspire to "transform" and "innovate" the countryside. There is not too much of this kind of ambition, but rather a great lack. But having ambition is not the same as being arrogant, and shaking one's head is not necessarily a sign of high aspirations. Even if we admit that the graduate is a "reformer" and "innovator," can things be done simply by shaking one's head and saying no? When I was a child, listening to myths and stories, I was often amazed by the magical powers of those great gods who could turn stones into gold and summon wind and rain. But even they had to "touch the stone" and "chant spells." In my memory, there were no gods who cast spells by shaking their heads. No matter how "powerful" today's high school graduates are, the thing of making the countryside change color by shaking their heads and saying no will not happen. If their hands are not stained with dust, even if they really have five carts of books in their belly, it is not as useful as a ladle of manure. The reason why they feel that there is no room for them in the world is actually a kind of empty frame of self-inflation. It is this frame that makes it difficult for their feet to touch the ground, and they float and want to take the path of empty-headed innovators. However, this path is impassable!
    Those who are truly committed to rural innovation are those who work diligently in the fields and strive to become true farmers. They value their existing book knowledge, but also understand that only when this knowledge is combined with production is it useful. So they happily engage in production. When people with culture enter production, that culture will have a material effect. It is this effect that promotes the "transformation" and "innovation" of the countryside. Facts have proved that only by transforming oneself first can one transform the countryside; only by earnestly becoming an apprentice to the farmers can one become a teacher to the farmers. This is an insurmountable track that must be followed. We can call this the path of practical innovators. The majority of young people who go to the countryside are now walking this path, which proves that there are always many smart people.
    Without the practice of production, there is no such thing as an "innovator." How can you become a dragon without entering the sea? If you are unwilling to even enter the water, you cannot even become a loach. If empty-headed innovators want to become dragons, they must first break the frames they have set up for themselves and change the bad habit of shaking their heads and saying no. Because innovation is a real path that cannot accommodate these frames.

    革新者的路	权玉
    已经有许多人去作有文化的农民，还有更多的人立下了宏大的志愿，准备下乡。但是，也有人走着空头革新家的路。报载：“荥阳县有一个高中毕业生，乡里让他作农业社副社长，他摇摇头说不；让他作会计，他连头也不摇就走了。”据说这位所以这么神气，是由于有“优越感”。自以为自己已经是农村的“改造”者和“革新”家了，哪里还屑作这种小事？至于要他像普通农民一样下地生产，更是连提都不能提，因为他是“同农民合不拢、说不来，又瞧不起农民”的。
    这种人自感“优越”的，无非是啃过几年书本，装了半肚子“知识”，他们所谓的“新”，大概也不外乎这点。“有文化的农民”，比起普通农民来，当然是“新”些的；可是，只有文化，并不生产呢？作一个“有文化的寄生者”，难道也是值得骄傲的吗？
    瞧不起农民，原是剥削阶级知识分子的通病。这位高中毕业生，对这学的不算坏，可惜有点过时，今日农村，说实话并不需要这种骑在农民头上的知识分子。其实，即使在过去，这种人在农村也并不行时。幼时在农村，曾见过一位城里回来的大学生，开始谈天说地，神气十足，十分的瞧不起乡下佬，不过后来露了马脚，他不仅分不清韭菜或麦苗，就连初生的荞麦或棉花，高粱或玉米也分不清。这就使连我这样的小孩子也不佩服了。大概是由于敬重斯文吧，乡亲们倒没有十分难为他，不过也给过一些嘲笑，还有一首歌：“熟读百家，不识五谷；上天（作官）有路，入地无门。”至今流作话柄。
  现在的学生，是不至于像以往的那样低能了，但从报纸上看，不懂怎样握镐把的人，还很有些。有的还得农民亲自把手去教，像教师把手教小学生写字的一样。我是不曾听说过小学生对教师有过什么“优越感”的。
    不管包装得怎样好的“优越感”，一碰上韭菜、麦苗之类的东西，都未免要露底，无需多说的了。重要的问题却是，有志于农村的革新者究竟应走怎样的路？
    将来农村“改造”和“革新”的重担，毕竟是要“有文化的农民”来担。这里面包括学了文化的农民，也包括从城里到农村去的有文化的人。因此，有志于农村的“改造”和“革新”，是完全值得嘉许的。这种志士对农村来说，不是多了，而是很缺。但有志并不等于狂妄自大，摇头也并不就是志高。即使承认那位毕业生是“改造”者和“革新”家吧，难道只靠摇头和说不就办得了事么？幼时听神话故事，我常常惊异于那些点石成金、呼风唤雨的大罗神仙们的神妙。但就是他们，也还要“点石”和“念咒”。我的记忆中，是并没有靠摇头施法的神仙的。不管如今的高中毕业生是否“神通广大”，摇摇头说声不，就使农村变色的事，还是不会有。倘使手不染尘，即使肚子里真的装有五车书，也顶不上一瓢大粪有用。他们所以觉得天底下容不下了，其实是自我膨胀的一种空架子。正是这架子的架隔，使得他们双脚难以着地，飘飘然地想走空头革新家的路了。然而，此路不通！
    真正有志于农村革新的，是踏踏实实下地生产，努力使自己成为真正农民的那种人。他们重视自己已有的书本知识，但也明白，只有这知识与生产结合才有用。于是他们愉快地去从事生产了。有文化的人一当进入生产，那文化便要发生物质作用，正是这作用，在促进着农村的“改造”和“革新”。事实证明，只有先改造自己，才能去改造农村；只有先认真地当农民的徒弟，才有可能去当农民的师傅。这是一条无法逾越的必须循之前进的轨道。我们可以叫这作实践革新家的路。现在走着这条路的，是下乡青年的大多数，这又证明着聪明人总是多的。
    离开生产的实践，便没有所谓“革新”家。不入大海，焉能成龙，连水也不愿下，是连泥鳅也作不成的。空头革新家如欲成龙，要先打碎自设的架子，改变摇头说不的坏习气。因为革新是一条实在的路，容不下这架子的。
