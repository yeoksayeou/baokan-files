Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd: In recent years, nothing in the world has aroused such great and widespread public interest as the Soviet Union's launching of artificial satellites. People are turning globes in search of the Soviet artificial satellite's trajectory, bookstores everywhere are issuing large quantities of books on interstellar flight, astronomical knowledge, and popular science and technology, and newspapers, magazines, radio commentators' broadcasts, and politicians' speeches cannot be separated from the Soviet artificial satellite. The Russian word "Sputnik" has become an international common word. Even many Western businessmen, in order to cater to customers' interests, are manufacturing and selling a large number of satellite toys that can emit "beeping" sounds, satellite balloons, and satellite-shaped decorations for women's outerwear.

This is what Borisova said in an article entitled "Soviet Satellite Attracts Millions of Hearts." This article was published in the recent "Soviet Trade News."

The author wrote: Millions of ordinary people on Earth are praising the scientific achievements of the Soviet Union. In a Soviet artificial satellite naming competition held by a British newspaper, readers used the most beautiful words to name the artificial satellite. They called it "Messenger of Peace," "New Dawn," "Hope," "Savior," etc.

Borisova said: The achievements of Soviet peaceful science have dealt a fatal blow to the "position of strength" policy. A major trump card of the United States—the intention to intimidate the socialist camp by relying on the myth of "Western technological and military superiority"—has been shattered. Norstad, commander-in-chief of the European forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, once said foolishly that the Soviet artificial satellite was just "two pieces of iron tumbling in interstellar space," but now he has to admit that Soviet science has outstanding achievements. An American university professor named Thomson in Glasgow said: "The Soviet Union has snatched the world's industrial leadership from the United States." The Dutch "Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant" pointed out that the Soviet Union's "huge new technological achievement has made Americans acutely aware of their backwardness."

The launch of the Soviet artificial satellite has plunged the bosses of Wall Street and the Pentagon into a state of panic. They are frantically preparing for the December meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In his speech about the launch of the Soviet artificial satellite and in his speech in Oklahoma City on November 13, Eisenhower tried his best to distort the essence and significance of the Soviet Union's scientific achievements, attempting to prove the necessity of increasing massive funding to manufacture missiles and nuclear weapons. The American bourgeois press launched a frenzied slander campaign against the Soviet Union, attempting to create a war-fever atmosphere in the country. They fabricated hundreds of news items, such as the appearance of mysterious celestial bodies over some military bases in the United States, the Soviet Union launching satellites for reconnaissance, and the discovery of Soviet "flying saucers," etc.

However, clear-headed people know what this frenzy means. The American newspaper "Daily News" described the furious mood of the American ruling group as: "Stupid, greedy, mixed with jealousy." The British newspaper "New Statesman and Nation" said: "The Soviet artificial satellite has opened a new page in the history of mankind's conquest of matter. Can we be so foolish as to regard it merely as a step in the 'Cold War'? It is really unbearable to listen to Mr. Dulles and Mr. Macmillan repeating the old tunes that were already outdated and unrealistic ten years ago."

Borisova wrote in conclusion: In this century, the "position of strength" policy is doomed to failure, and peaceful coexistence is the only possible path. Whoever does not understand this is bound to fail.

    苏联卫星吸引了千百万人的心
    苏报载文指出：美国“实力”政策是注定失败的了
    新华社莫斯科23日电　近年来，世界上没有一件事能像苏联发射人造卫星这样引起了公众如此巨大和普遍的兴趣。人们转着地球仪在寻找苏联人造卫星的行踪，各地书店大量发行着有关星际飞行、天文知识和通俗科学技术的书籍，报纸杂志、广播评论员的广播、政治活动家的言论都离不了苏联的人造卫星，俄文“卫星”这个字已变成一种国际通用词汇了。甚至西方很多商人为了迎合顾客的兴趣大量制造和出售一种能发出“噼噼”声的卫星玩具、卫星气球和卫星形的女外衣装饰品。
    这是波里索娃在一篇题为“苏联卫星吸引了千百万人的心”的文章中所说的。这篇文章刊载在最近的“苏维埃贸易报”上。
    作者写道：地球上千百万普通人都赞扬着苏联的科学成就。在英国一家报纸举办的苏联人造卫星有奖命名比赛中，读者们都是以最美好的词汇来给人造卫星命名。他们称它为“和平使者”、“新黎明”、“希望”、“救星”等。
    波里索娃说：苏联和平科学的成就给“实力地位”政策以致命的打击。美国的一张主要王牌——指望以“西方技术和军事优势”的神话来恐吓社会主义阵营的打算破灭了。北大西洋条约组织欧洲部队总司令诺斯塔德曾由于愚蠢而说过这样一句怪话：苏联人造卫星只不过是“发射到星际空间的不断翻转着的两块铁”，而现在却不得不承认苏联科学有着杰出的成就了。美国格拉斯哥一位叫汤姆生的大学教授说：“苏联已从美国手中争得工业的世界领导地位。”荷兰“新鹿特丹报”指出，苏联“这个巨大的技术新成就使美国人尖锐地感到自己的落后了”。
    苏联人造卫星的发射使华尔街和五角大楼的头子们陷于一片慌乱。他们正为北大西洋公约组织12月会议的召开而狂热地进行准备工作。艾森豪威尔在他的谈及苏联人造卫星的发射讲话和11月13日在俄克拉何马城所发表的演说中，极力歪曲苏联科学成就的实质和意义，企图证明有必要增加大量拨款来制造导弹和核武器。美国资产阶级报刊展开了一个对苏联进行疯狂的造谣污蔑的运动，企图在国内制造一种战争狂热的气氛。他们捏造出数百条消息，如说在美国某些军事基地上空出现神秘的天体，苏联将发射用于侦探的卫星，发现苏联的“飞碟”等。
    但是，头脑清醒的人都知道，这种狂热意味着什么。美国报纸“每日新闻”形容美国统治集团狂怒的心情时说：“愚蠢、贪婪、夹杂着妒忌。”英国报纸“新政治家与民族”说：“苏联的人造卫星揭开了人类征服物质的历史的新的一页。我们难道能够愚蠢到这种地步，仅仅把它看成‘冷战’中的一个步骤吗？杜勒斯先生和麦克米伦先生又在大言不惭地重弹十年前就已陈旧和不现实的老调，这真使人听不下去了。”
    波里索娃最后写道：在这个世纪，“实力地位”政策是注定失败的了，和平共处是唯一可能的道路。谁不明白这一点，谁就不可避免地要遭到失败。
