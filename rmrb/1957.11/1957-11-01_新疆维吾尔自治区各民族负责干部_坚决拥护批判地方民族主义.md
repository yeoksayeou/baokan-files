(Dispatch from our Urumqi correspondent, 29th) Leading Party and government cadres of all nationalities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region warmly support Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "Report on the Rectification Movement."

    Aisihaiti (Tatar nationality), Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Committee, said: The Party Central Committee's directive to carry out socialist education and appropriately conduct anti-rightist struggles in minority nationality areas and among minority nationality populations where the socialist transformation of the means of production has been basically realized is very timely and correct. I fully support it. He said that although great achievements have been made in overcoming local nationalism tendencies among cadres of all minority nationalities in the Autonomous Region since liberation, in recent years, local nationalism thinking has resurfaced among minority nationality intellectuals. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to emphasize opposing local nationalism tendencies in the current rectification movement. Local nationalism tendencies, like Han chauvinism tendencies, are detrimental to the unity of the socialist motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities. Through this movement, the unity of all nationalities will be further consolidated and strengthened.

    Sima Yi Yasheng (Uyghur nationality), Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, said: After reading the report on the rectification movement, my understanding of the rectification movement has been further improved. I fully support this report and will study it further in depth. He believes that the socialist transformation on the economic front of the Autonomous Region has achieved a decisive victory. Therefore, it is very timely to carry out socialist education and appropriately conduct anti-rightist struggles among minority nationalities in the Autonomous Region. He said that since liberation, cadres of all nationalities have made great progress under the education of the Party, but there are still a very few people who have local nationalism tendencies. They undermine national unity, and some even oppose the national policies clearly stipulated in the Constitution. In addition to this, there are also anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist elements and rightist remarks in other aspects. This shows that it is absolutely necessary for us to carry out rectification and improve the socialist ideological consciousness of all nationalities.

    Anniwaerhan Baba (Uzbek nationality), Minister of the Culture and Education Department of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping mentioned in his report that socialist education in minority nationality areas should also focus on opposing local nationalism tendencies, which I think is very correct. All minority nationalities in Xinjiang support socialism. I believe that through this rectification, local nationalism tendencies can be gradually overcome. He said that we must promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. Local nationalism is an important aspect of bourgeois ideology, so of course it must be opposed. Local nationalism tendencies exist among some cadres and university students of minority nationalities. Some people, under the guise of safeguarding the interests of their own nationality, are actually undermining the unity of all nationalities, opposing the leadership of the Party, undermining the unification of the motherland, and harming the fundamental interests of their own nationality. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose it.

    Jakulin (Kazak nationality), Director of the Construction Committee of the Autonomous Region, said: Over the past eight years, the Autonomous Region has cultivated a group of minority nationality cadres with communist ideology, which is a very favorable condition for carrying out socialist education, appropriately conducting anti-rightist struggles, and opposing local nationalism tendencies. He said that local nationalism is detrimental to socialist construction and the unity of all nationalities in the motherland. Therefore, opposing local nationalism tendencies among minority nationalities is of great significance for consolidating and strengthening the unity of all nationalities in our country.

    Yu Zhanlin (Hui nationality), Deputy Procurator-General of the Autonomous Region People's Procuratorate, said: I resolutely support Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report and will resolutely implement it in my future work. He said that carrying out socialist education among minority nationality cadres and the masses, and appropriately conducting anti-rightist struggles, especially focusing on opposing local nationalism tendencies among minority nationality cadres, is completely correct and very necessary. The rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle led by the Party this time will accelerate the completion of the great task of socialist revolution and construction in our country. However, the rightist elements are unwilling to let our people of all nationalities live a happy socialist life. They are spreading various fallacies with ulterior motives to attack the Party. No matter which nationality the rightist elements belong to, they are essentially the same. They are all against the Party and against socialism. Therefore, we should also conduct a resolute struggle against the rightist elements among minority nationalities. He also said that emphasizing the opposition to local nationalism tendencies in the anti-rightist struggle among minority nationalities is as necessary as emphasizing the opposition to Han chauvinism tendencies among Han cadres in the past. Local nationalism tendencies and Han chauvinism tendencies are both bourgeois anti-socialist tendencies, and have the same harm to the unity and unification of all nationalities. If we want to take the socialist road, we must have the unity of all nationalities and the unification of the country, and more importantly, we must have the leadership of the Communist Party. Opposing the leadership of the Party, creating national division, and undermining the unification of the motherland are a disaster for minority nationalities. Therefore, we must conduct a resolute struggle against local nationalism tendencies. At the same time, the rectification and anti-rightist struggles among minority nationalities must be carried out under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the Han people to ensure that the struggle wins a complete victory.

    新疆维吾尔自治区各民族负责干部
    坚决拥护批判地方民族主义
    本报乌鲁木齐29日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各民族党政领导干部热烈拥护邓小平同志所作的“关于整风运动的报告”。
    自治区人民委员会副主席艾斯海提（塔塔尔族）说：党中央提出在已经基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造的少数民族地区和少数民族人口中，进行社会主义教育和适当地进行反右派斗争，这一指示是非常及时和正确的，我完全表示拥护。他说，解放后在自治区各少数民族干部中克服地方民族主义倾向方面虽然取得了很大成绩，但是，最近几年来，在少数民族知识分子里面，地方民族主义思想又有了一些抬头，所以现在在整风运动中强调反对地方民族主义倾向是完全必要的。地方民族主义倾向和大汉族主义倾向一样，都是不利于社会主义祖国的统一和各民族的团结的。经过这次运动，各民族的团结将会进一步巩固和加强。
    自治区党委农村工作部部长司马益牙生（维吾尔族）说：我看了关于整风运动的报告以后，对于整风运动的认识又提高了一步，我完全拥护这个报告，并且还要进一步地深入学习。他认为，自治区经济战线上的社会主义改造已经取得了决定性的胜利，因此，在自治区少数民族中进行社会主义教育，并适当地进行反右派斗争，是非常适时的。他说，解放以来，各民族干部在党的教育下有了很大的进步，但是，还有极少数的人存在着地方民族主义倾向。他们破坏民族团结，甚至有的还反对宪法中明确规定的民族政策。除此而外，在其他方面，反党反社会主义的右派分子和右派言论也是有的。这说明，我们必须进行整风，提高各族人民的社会主义思想觉悟，是完全必要的。
    自治区党委文教部部长安尼瓦尔汗巴巴（乌孜别克族）说：邓小平同志在报告中提到少数民族地区进行社会主义教育还应该着重反对地方民族主义倾向，我认为很对。新疆各少数民族都是拥护社会主义的，我相信，经过这次整风，地方民族主义倾向是可以逐步克服的。他说，我们要兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想，地方民族主义是资产阶级思想的一个重要方面，当然要把它反掉。地方民族主义倾向，在少数民族的一些干部和大学生中是存在的，有的人打着维护本民族利益的幌子，实际上是在破坏各民族的团结，反对党的领导，破坏祖国的统一，损害本民族的根本利益，因此我们必须坚决反对。
    自治区建设委员会主任贾库林（哈萨克族）说：八年来自治区已经培养出一批具有共产主义思想的少数民族干部，这对于进行社会主义教育和适当地进行反右派以及反对地方民族主义倾向，都是非常有利的条件。他说，地方民族主义是不利于社会主义建设和祖国各民族的团结的，所以在少数民族中反对地方民族主义倾向，对于巩固和加强我国各民族的团结有巨大意义。
    自治区人民检察院副检察长禹占林（回族）说：我坚决拥护邓小平同志的报告，并要在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。他说，在少数民族干部和群众中进行社会主义教育，并且适当地进行反右派斗争，特别是在少数民族干部中着重反对地方民族主义倾向，是完全正确和十分必要的。这次党所领导的整风运动和反右派斗争，它将使我国加速完成社会主义革命和建设的伟大任务。但是右派分子却不肯让我们各族人民过社会主义的幸福生活，他们别有用心地散布各种谬论向党进攻。不论那个民族中的右派分子，在本质上都是一样的，都是反对党，反对社会主义的，因此对少数民族中的右派分子也应该进行坚决的斗争。他又说，在少数民族中进行反右派斗争中强调反对地方民族主义倾向，这如同过去在汉族干部中强调反对大汉族主义倾向一样，是十分必要的。地方民族主义倾向和大汉族主义倾向，同样是资产阶级的反社会主义的倾向，对于各民族的团结统一有同样的危害性。我们要走社会主义道路，就必须要有各民族的团结和国家的统一，更主要的是必须要有共产党的领导。反对党的领导，制造民族分裂，破坏祖国统一，就是少数民族的灾难。因此对于地方民族主义倾向，必须进行坚决的斗争。同时在少数民族中进行整风和反右派斗争，必须在党的领导和汉族人民的帮助下，才能保证斗争获得彻底胜利。
