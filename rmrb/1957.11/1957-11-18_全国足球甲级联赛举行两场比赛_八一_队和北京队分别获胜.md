National Football League Holds Two Matches
"August 1st" Team and Beijing Team Win Separately

(Our Newspaper) News: Two matches of the National Football League's Beijing competition zone were held on the 17th. In the match at the Beijing Xian Nong Tan Stadium, the "August 1st" team won against the Changchun team with a score of three to zero; in the match at the Beijing Gymnasium football field, the Beijing team won against the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education team with a score of three to two.

The advantages displayed by the Changchun team in yesterday's game were: fast speed, agile and quick movements, and active ball grabbing. However, they lacked the skill of scoring at the crucial moment, which caused them to lose many scoring opportunities. For example, forwards Chi Qinglong, Song Zhixue, and Li Guangzhu all had good shooting opportunities in front of the opponent's goal, but they missed them. Their lack of scoring skills was also reflected in inaccurate shooting. Many hurried and powerful shots flew past the left and right sides or above the opponent's goal and out of bounds.

The "August 1st" team played decisively and bravely in yesterday's game. They seized on the weakness of the Changchun team being shorter in height, and transferred the tall Gao Junshi, who originally played as a defender, to the position of forward, preparing to use headers to score. This method proved effective. Yesterday, Gao Junshi scored two goals with headers and kicks, and left winger Cui Hengxie also kicked in one goal. The "August 1st" team finally won against the Changchun team with a score of three to zero.

Yesterday's match at the Beijing Gymnasium football field was between the Beijing team and the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education team. In the first half, the Beijing team did not play ideally. The Shenyang Institute of Physical Education team was very active, with fierce attacks, and frequently threatened the Beijing team's goal, scoring two goals in the 13th and 17th minutes. Although the Beijing team had many shooting opportunities, they were either out of bounds or caught by the goalkeeper. In the 35th minute, a Shenyang Institute of Physical Education defender committed a handball foul, and the Beijing team scored a penalty kick, bringing back one goal. The first half ended with a score of two to one, with the Beijing team losing by one goal. In the second half, the Beijing team learned from the lessons of the first half. The defensive players actively intercepted outside the penalty area, and the forwards also made good use of cross-position changes and spreading out on both wings. As expected, the situation changed greatly. In the latter forty-five minutes, the advantage was almost entirely in the hands of the Beijing team, and the Beijing team's defenders even crossed the midfield line to assist in the attack. The Shenyang Institute of Physical Education team defended with all their might in the second half, trying to maintain the lead from the first half, but under the strong offensive of the Beijing team, they were finally scored on twice. The final result was three to two, with the Beijing team winning narrowly.

    全国足球甲级联赛举行两场比赛
    “八一”队和北京队分别获胜
    本报讯　全国足球甲级队联赛北京竞赛区在17日举行了两场比赛。在北京先农坛体育场的一场“八一”队以三比○胜长春队；在北京体育馆足球场的一场，北京队以三比二胜沈阳体育学院队。
    长春队昨天在比赛中表现出来的优点是：速度快，动作灵活迅速，抢球积极。但是他们在紧要关头时，却缺乏门前一脚的功夫，致使许多应该得分的机会失掉了。例如前锋池青龙、宋智学、李光洙等都曾在对方门前获得射门的良好机会，但是他们都错过了。他们缺乏门前一脚功夫还表现在射门不准上面，许多急而劲的球都从他们的脚下飞经对方门的左右方或上方越出界外。
    “八一”队在昨天的比赛中，表现得果断勇敢，他们抓住了长春队个子较矮的弱点，把原来踢后卫的高个子高筠时调任前锋，准备利用头顶球得分。这个办法果然生效，昨天高筠时连顶带踢独中两球，加上左翼崔亨燮踢入一球，“八一”队最后以三比○胜长春队。
    昨天在北京体育馆足球场比赛的是北京队对沈阳体育学院队。上半时北京队打得不够理想。沈阳体育学院队非常活跃，攻势很猛，经常威胁北京队的球门，先后在十三和十七分钟射入北京队大门两个球。北京队虽有好多次射门机会，但都不是越界，就是被守门员接住。在三十五分钟时，沈阳体育学院后卫手球犯规，北京队罚球，点球入网，这才扳回一球。上半时二比一终局，北京队先输一球。下半时北京队吸取了上半时的教训，卫线队员在禁区外积极上前阻截，锋线队员也很好地利用了交叉换位和两翼拉开的打法，果然局面大大改观。在后一个四十五分钟中，优势几乎完全掌握在北京队手里，北京队的后卫都压过中线来助攻。沈阳体育学院队下半时全力防守，力图保持上半时的胜局，但在北京队的强大攻势下，终被攻入两个球。全场结果三比二，北京队小胜。
