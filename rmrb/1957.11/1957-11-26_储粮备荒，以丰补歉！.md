Store Grain to Prepare for Famine, Supplement Shortfalls with Surplus!
The 25th article of the "National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft)" proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China from 1956 to 1967 stipulates: "It is required that all agricultural cooperatives, except for those mainly engaged in forestry or cash crops, should, starting from 1956, formulate specific plans within twelve years, according to their own circumstances, and, together with the grain reserves of cooperative members' families, store enough surplus grain for three months, half a year, a year, or a year and a half of consumption, to meet the needs of emergencies. In areas where harvests are often uncertain and transportation is inconvenient, special attention should be paid to supplementing shortfalls with surplus and storing grain to prevent famine." The issue is very clear, and earnestly implementing this policy is of great practical significance for solving China's grain problem.
As everyone knows, although China's grain is enough for consumption, it is not very abundant. In particular, agricultural harvests are still very unstable due to the frequent impact of natural disasters, and there are many difficulties in the event of famine. A review of our history over the past few years will clearly show this. Therefore, before the fundamental solution to the problem of increasing grain production in China, and before the completion of the technological transformation of agriculture, in order to overcome grain difficulties, ensure the stability of people's lives, and establish a solid foundation for national construction plans, it is necessary for the whole country to implement the policy of storing grain to prepare for famine. That is to say, in addition to the state's need to implement the policy of "supplementing shortfalls with surplus" and "increasing production and increasing purchases" under the policy of unified purchase and sales, agricultural cooperatives and farmers' families should also, under possible conditions, find ways to raise a certain amount of grain as reserve grain for use in disaster years. Doing so is of great benefit to the country, agricultural cooperatives, and farmers.
Our country is building socialism on a poor and backward economic foundation, and it is necessary to use human, material, and financial resources in key areas, and absolutely not allow waste. However, in the event of a disaster, it is necessary to consume a large amount of originally limited human, material, and financial resources. For example, after China suffered a major disaster in 1956, the state transferred more than 7 billion catties of grain from all over the country to the seven provinces with more severe disasters in order to help agricultural cooperatives and farmers in the disaster areas restore their production capacity; mobilizing a large amount of human, material, and financial resources was required to transfer so much grain. If agricultural cooperatives and farmers' families have their own reserve grain, they will strengthen their ability to expand production and resist disasters, partially solve the disasters or other temporary special difficulties suffered by agricultural cooperatives and their members, thereby greatly reducing the burden on the state, and enabling the state to invest more of its limited funds in production and construction, and concentrate more time and energy on economic construction. As far as agricultural cooperatives are concerned, because the state's investment is limited, the development of agricultural production mainly depends on the accumulation and labor of agricultural cooperatives. With grain reserves, agricultural cooperatives have a reliable guarantee for developing agricultural production; at the same time, the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives also has a material basis. As far as farmers' families are concerned, although the state's grain reserves strive to increase in recent years, they are still limited after all. Nearly 100 million people in cities and industrial and mining areas and tens of millions of people in cash crop areas need the state to supply grain, and the grain purchased by the state in disaster years will also be reduced. Therefore, the grain supply to the disaster-stricken population can only guarantee the essential basic needs. It is currently impossible to avoid lowering the level of grain consumption when affected by disaster. However, if the people in the disaster area have some reserve grain of their own, their lives will not decline too much, and it may even be possible to live a stable life even in years of major disasters. It can be seen that storing grain to prepare for famine by agricultural cooperatives and farmers' families is a correct policy for making the people rich and the country strong.
Storing grain to prepare for famine is a good method passed down through generations by the working people of our country. However, it was impossible for them to store grain in the old society. Only under today's conditions can agricultural cooperatives and farmers' families gradually and systematically store a certain amount of grain, and strive to be self-reliant in the event of general disasters, without adding extra burden to the state. This is not only necessary, but also completely achievable. In recent years, China's grain production has increased year by year, and now the actual grain output of many agricultural cooperatives has exceeded the "three fix" output, and the grain consumption of farmers has also been greatly improved. All this shows that agricultural cooperatives and farmers' families have the possibility to gradually and systematically reserve grain. This is also the case in reality. Currently, 20%-30% of farm households nationwide have grain reserves; incomplete statistics of 2,387 agricultural cooperatives in six counties, including Linxiang and Xiangyin, in Xiangtan Prefecture, Hunan Province, have already reserved 24.2 million catties of grain. Aren't these facts sufficient to show that it is entirely possible for agricultural cooperatives and farmers' families to reserve grain?
Experience in various places has proven that the key to storing grain and preparing for famine lies in careful calculation, thrift, and frugality. Zeng Shaoqing and Wu Hongzhang, members of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Leshan Township, Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, have the same number of family members and similar labor forces. Last autumn, Zeng Shaoqing's family had an average of 110 catties more grain per person than Wu Hongzhang's family. However, Zeng Shaoqing often exchanged grain for alcohol, resulting in a shortage of one month's food; Wu Hongzhang's whole family was diligent and frugal, and paid attention to saving grain as soon as it was distributed, without arbitrarily wasting a single grain. When new grain was distributed this year, there were still more than 280 catties of stored grain. There are such examples everywhere. It can be seen that as long as we practice strict economy, the existing grain is not only enough for consumption, but can also be appropriately reserved.
Some farmers were very good at careful calculation, thrift, and frugality when they were operating individually, planning for lean years in good years, storing grain to prevent hunger, and storing grain to prepare for famine; but now they not only eat more, but also arbitrarily use staple food to make sugar and distill alcohol, and hold banquets when there are happy events, only caring about the immediate pleasure of eating and drinking, regardless of the future, and harboring the wrong idea of asking the cooperative and the government for food after eating it all. After the new grain was on the market this year, 105 members of the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative in Xinjian Township, Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, consumed an average of more than 50 catties of grain per household for winemaking, ate four meals a day, and even ate snacks late at night; they also wasted a lot of grain in raising ducks and pigs. Therefore, some places used to be very well-off with 400 catties of grain, but now they are not satisfied with 800 catties of grain. Farmers in our country have always had the good habit of mixing melons, vegetables, and miscellaneous grains into their diet, but since last year, many places have also lost this good habit. Everyone, think about it, if this continues to develop, how can we store grain and prepare for famine? Therefore, around the autumn harvest, all localities should combine the socialist education movement to conduct a concentrated ideological education on diligent housekeeping and storing grain to prepare for famine among the vast number of farmers, so that farmers can understand the correct attitude to treat the relationship between individuals and collectives and the country, understand that in today's cooperative era, it is still necessary to be diligent in housekeeping, and understand that in order to stabilize life, it is necessary to store grain and prepare for famine, and to store grain and prepare for famine, it is necessary to be thrifty and frugal, and strictly practice economy.
There is great potential for saving grain in rural areas, especially in saving grain during the autumn harvest. In this year's autumn harvest, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, universally organized women and students to go to the fields to pick up the scattered crops, and harvested 50 catties more grain per hectare than last year. With this item alone, the whole county harvested 1.2 million catties more grain than last year. In the autumn harvest, the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Tongren County, Guizhou Province, implemented "light cutting, slow release, heavy beating, and light winnowing," reducing the scattered rice by more than 63,000 catties. Judging from the current situation of the autumn harvest in the country, the phenomenon of wasting grain due to unclean harvesting and threshing, scattering during transportation, and damage by livestock and poultry is quite common and serious. It is entirely conceivable that if every agricultural cooperative pays attention to saving grain in the autumn harvest, effectively achieves careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, returns every grain to the home, and does not waste grain, then not only can more surplus grain be sold to the state, but the agricultural cooperative itself can also greatly increase its grain reserves. Now the agricultural cooperatives have larger families, and if they are not careful, losing a few catties of grain per mu will accumulate into a considerable amount. Therefore, we should make every effort and think of every way to prevent the loss and waste of grain during the autumn harvest.
Agricultural cooperatives and farmers' families raising reserve grain must strictly implement the principle of "the state first, then ourselves." That is to say, agricultural cooperatives should, after ensuring the completion of the state's grain purchase (including increased production and increased purchases) and reducing grain sales, as well as solving the expenditure of internal investment, gradually take out a certain amount of grain from the expansion of public accumulation as reserve grain; farmers' families mainly rely on careful calculation and frugal living, thrift and frugality, and accumulating grain reserves little by little. If one does not strive to complete the state's purchase tasks in order to reserve more for oneself, or the idea and practice of destroying the agricultural cooperative's expansion of legitimate public accumulation are wrong and absolutely must not be done. The principle of using grain reserves of agricultural cooperatives should be clearly stipulated after discussion by members. Generally, it can only be used to solve the grain shortage difficulties caused by members suffering from irresistible disasters, and the rations of the population moving in after the final settlement and distribution of the agricultural cooperative, as well as other special temporary needs. For farmers who lack grain due to not saving grain and eating and using it indiscriminately, they should not be given a solution. Otherwise, it will not only affect the enthusiasm of the vast number of members to store grain, but also lose the true meaning of storing grain and preparing for famine. Therefore, when using reserve grain, it should go through certain democratic discussion and approval procedures.
Now is the time for every farmer to arrange their daily life plan after the autumn harvest. We hope that everyone should cultivate the good habit and atmosphere of careful calculation and diligent housekeeping. This year's agricultural harvest is not bad, it is a normal and slightly better year, which is more conducive to storing grain and preparing for famine. We must not miss such a great opportunity.

### 储粮备荒，以丰补歉！

    储粮备荒，以丰补歉！
    中共中央提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）第二十五条规定：“要求一切农业合作社，除了主要是经营山林或者经营经济作物的缺粮社以外，从一九五六年起，在十二年内，按照自己的情况，定出具体计划，加上社员家庭的粮食储备，分别储积足够三个月、半年、一年或者一年半食用的余粮，以备紧急时候的需要。在丰歉经常不定和交通不便的地区，特别要注意以丰补歉，积谷防荒。”问题非常明显，认真贯彻执行这一方针，对于解决我国的粮食问题具有重大的现实意义。
    大家都知道，我国的粮食虽然够吃够用，但是并不十分宽裕，特别是农业的收成因为经常受着自然灾害的影响还很不稳定，遇到灾荒，就有许多困难。只要回顾一下我们过去几年的历史，就会很清楚地看到这一点。因此，我国在粮食增产问题没有根本解决以前，在农业的技术改造没有完成以前，要渡过粮食的困难，保证人民生活的稳定，并使国家建设计划立足稳固，就必须举国一致地实行储粮备荒的方针。这就是说，除了国家必须在坚持统购统销的政策下实行“以丰补歉”、“增产增购”的方针以外，农业合作社和农民家庭也要在可能的条件下，设法筹集一定数量的粮食作为储备粮，以备灾年需用。这样做，对国家、对农业合作社、对农民都是有极大好处的。
    我们的国家是在一个贫困落后的经济基础上建设社会主义，需要把人力、物力和财力用在带关键性的地方上去，而决不允许浪费。可是，一遇到灾荒，就要大量地消耗本来有限的人力、物力和财力。例如1956年我国遭受重灾以后，国家为了帮助灾区农业合作社和农民恢复生产能力，从全国各地向灾情较重的七个省份调集了七十多亿斤粮食；为了调集这样多的粮食就要动员大量的人力、物力和财力。如果农业合作社和农民家庭有了自己的储备粮，就会加强扩大生产和抗灾的能力，部分地解决农业合作社和社员遭受灾害或者发生其他临时的特殊困难，从而也就会大大减轻国家的负担，使国家有可能把有限的资金更多地投放在生产建设上面去，有可能集中更多的时间和精力去搞经济建设。就对农业合作社来说，由于国家的投资有限，发展农业生产主要依靠农业社的积累和人力，农业社有了粮食储备，发展农业生产也就有了可靠的保证；同时，农业社的巩固也有了物质基础。就对农民家庭来说，国家的粮食储备，在最近几年内虽然力求增加一些，但毕竟还是有限的，近一亿的城市、工矿区人口和几千万经济作物区的人口，都需要国家供应粮食，灾年国家征购的粮食还要减少。所以对灾区人口的粮食供应，只能保证必不可少的基本需要。受灾而不降低粮食的消费水平，在目前还是不可能的。但是，如果灾区人民自己有一些储备粮的话，生活就不至于下降太多，甚至有可能在大灾之年仍然可以过常年的稳定生活。由此可见，农业社和农民家庭储粮备荒，是使民富国强的一条正确方针。
    储粮备荒是我国劳动人民世代相传的好办法。但是在旧社会，他们要积谷也不可能。只有在今天的条件下，农业社和农民家庭才能够逐步有计划地储存一定数量的粮食，并争取在一般灾年的情况下，可以自力更生，不给国家增加额外的负担。这不仅是必要的，而且也是完全能够做得到的。几年来，我国的粮食产量逐年增加，现在许多农业社的粮食实产量超过了“三定”产量，农民的用粮情况也有了很大改善。这一切都说明，农业社和农民家庭已有可能开始逐步有计划地储备粮食。事实也是这样。现在全国农户中已有20％—30％的储粮户；湖南省湘潭专区临湘、湘阴等六个县二千三百八十七个农业社的不完全统计，已经储备了二千四百二十万斤粮食。这些事实不是足可以说明农业社和农民家庭储备粮食是完全可能的吗？
    各地的经验证明，储粮备荒的关键，在于精打细算、省吃俭用。贵州省遵义县乐山乡东方红农业社社员曾少清和吴洪章，两家人口一样多，劳动力也相当。去年秋季收入，曾少清家每人平均所得粮食，还比吴洪章家多一百一十斤。但是，曾少清经常用粮食换酒喝，结果缺一个月的口粮；吴洪章全家勤俭，粮食一分到手就注意节约，不任意浪费一粒粮食，到今年新粮分配的时候，还有存粮二百八十多斤。这样的例子各地都有。可见只要厉行节约，现有的粮食不但够吃够用，而且还可以适当地进行储备。
    有些农民在个体经营的时候，很会一点一滴地精打细算、省吃俭用地过日子，丰年为歉年作打算，积谷防饥，储粮备荒；可是现在不但吃的多了，而且肆意用主粮熬糖、蒸酒，逢有喜事大摆筵席，只顾眼前吃喝痛快，不管将来，抱着吃完了向合作社和政府要的错误想法。浙江省新登县新建乡新民农业社一百零五户社员，在今年新谷上市以后，每户酿酒耗用的粮食平均在五十斤以上，每天都吃四顿饭，深夜还要吃一次点心；在养鸭和养猪方面也浪费很多粮食。所以有些地方过去吃四百斤粮食就很宽裕，现在吃八百斤粮食反而叫不够。我国农民历来有掺食瓜菜、杂粮的良好习惯，去年以来很多地方也把这种好习惯丢掉了。大家想一想，如果这样发展下去，还怎能储粮备荒呢？因此，在秋收前后，各地应该结合社会主义教育运动，对广大农民集中地进行一次勤俭持家、储粮备荒的思想教育，使农民懂得用正确的态度去对待个人同集体和国家的关系，懂得在合作化了的今天，仍然需要勤俭持家的道理，懂得要想生活稳定，必须储粮备荒，而要储粮备荒，就必须省吃俭用，厉行节约。
    农村中节约粮食的潜力很大，特别是在秋收当中节约粮食更大有可为。黑龙江省肇东县在今年秋收中，普遍组织妇女、学生下地拣抛撒的庄稼，一公顷地比去年多收五十斤粮食。仅仅这一项，全县就比去年多收了一百二十万斤粮食。贵州省铜仁县和平农业社在秋收中，实行“轻割、慢放、重打、轻扬”，减少抛撒的稻谷有六万三千多斤。从全国目前秋收的情况来看，由于收割、打场不净，驮运抛撒，牲畜、家禽糟损等等浪费粮食的现象，是相当普遍而严重的。完全可以设想，如果每一个农业社在秋收当中都注意节约粮食，切实做到精收细打，颗粒还家，不糟蹋粮食，那么，不仅可以把更多的余粮卖给国家，农业社本身也可以大大增加粮食储备。现在的农业社的家业大了，稍不注意，每亩地损失几斤粮食，积累起来就是一笔不小的数目。所以，我们应该尽一切努力，想尽一切办法，来杜绝秋收中损失和浪费粮食的现象发生。
    农业社和农民家庭筹集储备粮，必须严格执行先国家、后自己的原则。就是说，农业社应该在保证完成国家粮食征购（包括增产增购）和压缩粮食销量的任务，以及解决社内投资的开支以后，从扩大公共积累中逐年拿出一定数量的粮食作为储备粮；农民家庭储粮主要是依靠平常精打细算过日子，省吃俭用，一点一滴地积累粮食储备。如果为了自己多储备，而不去努力完成国家的征购任务，或者破坏农业社扩大正当的公共积累的想法和做法都是错误的，是万万做不得的。农业社储备粮的使用原则，应该通过社员讨论后作出明确的规定，一般只能用以解决社员因遭受人力不可抗拒的灾害而发生的缺粮困难，和农业社决算分配以后迁入人口的口粮，以及其他特殊的临时需要，对于因为不节约用粮、乱吃滥用而发生缺粮的农户，则不应予以解决。否则，不仅会影响广大社员的储粮积极性，而且也失去了储粮备荒的真正意义。因此，在动用储备粮的时候，应该经过一定的民主讨论和批准手续。
    现在正当秋收以后每个农家安排日常生活计划的时候，我们希望每个人都应该培养精打细算、勤俭持家的良好习惯和风气。今年的农业收成不坏，是个正常偏丰的年景，更有利于储粮备荒。我们不要放过这样一个大好时机。
