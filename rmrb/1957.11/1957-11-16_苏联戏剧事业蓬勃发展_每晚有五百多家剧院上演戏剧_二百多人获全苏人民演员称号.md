Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 14th: Soviet drama has experienced tremendous development over the past forty years. Now, every night, 512 theaters across the country perform in more than 40 languages.

In the Tsarist era, there were only over 170 theaters nationwide, and many places had no theaters at all. Theaters kept the working masses outside. The salvo of the cruiser "Aurora" heralded a new era and also opened the doors of the theaters. In the forty years of Soviet power, the number of Soviet theaters has tripled. The total number of audience members has reached over 3 billion, more than the entire population of the world.

Even during the war years, the Party and the government attached great importance to artistic performances, organizing 1.35 million concerts and theatrical performances, of which more than 473,000 were held directly under combat conditions.

In 1956 alone, Soviet theaters had 76 million viewers, more than the combined population of France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, and Greece. During the era of Soviet power, 217 people have been awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR.

Under the care of the Soviet government, the people's amateur theatrical cause has flourished.

    苏联戏剧事业蓬勃发展
    每晚有五百多家剧院上演戏剧
    二百多人获全苏人民演员称号
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联的戏剧事业四十年来获得了巨大的发展，现在每天晚上全国有五百一十二个剧院用四十多种语言进行演出。
    帝俄时代全国只有一百七十多个剧院，好多地方是没有剧院的，剧院把劳动群众关在门外。“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰的炮声宣告了新的纪元，也打开了剧院的大门。苏维埃政权的四十年间，苏联剧院增加了两倍。观众共达三十多亿人次，为全世界人口的一倍多。
    即使在战争的年代里，党和政府还十分重视文艺演出，组织了一百三十五万次的音乐会和戏剧演出，其中有四十七万三千多次是直接在战斗的情况下举行的。
    单是1956年，苏联剧院的观众就有七千六百万人，比法国、比利时、丹麦、芬兰、希腊等国的人口总数还要多。在苏维埃政权年代里有二百一十七个人获得了全苏人民演员的称号。
    在苏维埃政权的关怀下，人民的业余戏剧事业获得了蓬勃发展。
