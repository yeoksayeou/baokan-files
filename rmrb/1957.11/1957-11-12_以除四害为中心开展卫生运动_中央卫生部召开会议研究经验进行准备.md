To prepare for a further large-scale patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, the Ministry of Public Health convened an experience research meeting on the 11th to summarize the typical experiences of patriotic health campaigns and pest elimination over the past few years. Forty-five representatives from thirty-three typical units in fifteen provinces and cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Jiangsu, attended the meeting, and forty-two representatives from relevant central departments were also invited to participate.

Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of Public Health, made a brief report at the beginning of the meeting. He said: Since the crushing of the American imperialist’s germ warfare in 1952 and the launch of the patriotic health campaign nationwide, and since the launch of the patriotic health campaign centered on "eliminating the four pests" in 1956, great achievements have been made. Not only has the appearance of urban and rural areas changed significantly, but the people's health has also greatly improved. Many cities, factories, rural areas, and schools have created many valuable experiences in improving sanitation. However, because the Ministry of Public Health did not closely supervise inspections in its leadership work and did not summarize and exchange typical experiences from various places well and in a timely manner, the campaign in some places has not been carried out well enough, and even to this day, some people are still unclear about whether the four pests can be eliminated. He emphasized that in order to continuously improve the people's health, ensure socialist construction, and achieve the Party's goal in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) of eliminating the four pests within twelve years (from 1956), it is urgently necessary to summarize the experiences of patriotic health campaigns in various places in the past in order to better carry out the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests.

Vice Minister Xu Yunbei also affirmed based on the experience of various places that we are fully capable of carrying out the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests even better. He cited the typical example of Qile Township in Lechang County, Guangdong Province, a model township for patriotic health campaigns and the elimination of the four pests, saying that if the masses in Qile Township can do it, it is possible for rural areas in Guangdong Province and rural areas throughout the country to do it as well. The experiences of various places powerfully illustrate this point.

In order to summarize the experiences of the past few years and prepare for a large-scale patriotic health campaign next year, he asked the representatives attending the meeting to carefully study the experiences, criticize the shortcomings, and discuss the work for next year based on the spirit of rectification and airing views, and on the basis of past experiences.

After the report, representatives from typical units such as Beijing Municipality, Qile Township in Guangdong, Jiujiang City, Fushun Open-pit Coal Mine, Tianjin Vegetable and Food Company, Dongran Village in Haidian District of Beijing, and Huoqiying made presentations on their experiences. Starting from the 12th, representatives from typical units such as cities, residential areas, factories, food and beverage service industries, and rural areas will continue to introduce their work experiences and conduct discussions. The meeting is expected to last four days.

    以除四害为中心开展卫生运动
    中央卫生部召开会议研究经验进行准备
    本报讯　为进一步大规模开展以除四害为中心内容的爱国卫生运动作准备，卫生部在11日召开经验研究会议，总结几年来爱国卫生运动及除四害的典型经验。出席会议的有北京、上海、广东、江苏等十五个省市，三十三个典型单位的代表四十五人，中央有关各部门的代表四十二人也应邀参加了这次会议。
    卫生部徐运北副部长在会议开始时作了简短的报告。他说：自从1952年粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战，在全国范围内开展了爱国卫生运动，和1956年开展以“除四害”为中心的爱国卫生运动以来，取得了很大的成绩，不仅城乡的面貌有了显著的改变，人民健康状况也有了很大的改进。许多城市、工厂、农村、学校在改善卫生方面都创造了很多宝贵的经验。但是，由于卫生部在领导工作中没有抓紧检查，对各地典型经验没有很好地及时地总结交流，以致有些地方的运动还开展得不够好，甚至直到目前，有些人对能不能消灭四害还弄不清楚。他强调指出：为了不断提高人民健康水平，保证社会主义建设，实现党在全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中所提出的，在十二年内（从1956年起）消灭四害的努力目标，更好地开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，迫切要求总结各地以往开展爱国卫生运动的经验。
    徐运北副部长还根据各地的经验肯定地说，我们完全有可能把以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动开展得更好。他举广东省爱国卫生运动和除四害的模范乡——乐昌县歧乐乡的典型事例说，歧乐乡的群众能够做到，广东省各地农村，全国各地农村也都有可能做到。各地的经验都有力地说明了这个问题。
    为了总结好几年来的经验，为明年大规模开展爱国卫生运动作好准备，他要求到会的代表要根据整风和鸣放的精神，认真地研究经验，批评缺点，并以过去的经验为基础，讨论明年的工作。
    报告结束后，北京市、广东歧乐乡、九江市、抚顺露天煤矿、天津市菜蔬食品公司、北京市海淀区东冉村、火器营等典型单位的代表作了经验介绍。从12日起，会议将继续由各城市、居民区、工厂、饮食服务行业、农村等典型单位代表，分别介绍工作经验，并进行讨论。会期预计四天。
