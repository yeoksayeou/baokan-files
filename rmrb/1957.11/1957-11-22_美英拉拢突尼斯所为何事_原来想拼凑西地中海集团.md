Xinhua News Agency, November 21st -- An Associated Press dispatch from London on the 20th revealed the conspiracy of the United States and Britain to woo Tunisia by supplying weapons in order to piece together a so-called "Western Mediterranean Group."

The dispatch indicates that the intention of the United States and Britain is to intervene in North African affairs with the help of certain "moderate local leaders" in order to achieve the so-called "comprehensive resolution and stabilization of the North African situation." The dispatch also pointed out that the dispute between the United States and Britain and France over the supply of arms to Tunisia "is to some extent a starting point for a solution to the Algerian problem." The dispatch quoted well-informed sources as saying that "a little assistance" to Tunisian President Bourguiba could prompt him to "willingly help find" several Algerian "moderates" who could negotiate with France. These people would accept some suggestions made by France "after consultation with its allies" that "the West can generally support," thereby breaking the "stalemate" in North Africa.

The dispatch said that Washington and London believe that it is possible to piece together a regional political and "defense" group in the Western Mediterranean region to link up with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; its members would include Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, and Spain.

    美英拉拢突尼斯所为何事
    原来想拼凑西地中海集团
    据新华社21日讯　美联社20日从伦敦发出的一则电讯中透露了美英借供应武器来拉拢突尼斯以便拼凑所谓“西地中海集团”的阴谋。
    这条电讯表明，美英两国的意图是要借助于某些“温和的地方领袖”来插手北非事务，以便达到所谓“全面解决和安定北非局势”的目的。电讯并且指出，美英两国同法国在供给突尼斯军火问题上的争执，“就某种程度来说，是走向解决阿尔及利亚问题的一个起点”。电讯引消息灵通人士的话说，通过对突尼斯总统布尔吉巴“稍加援助”，就可以促使他“乐意帮助物色”几个可以同法国进行谈判的阿尔及利亚“温和人士”。这些人将会接受法国在“和盟国会商之后”所提出的一些“西方大体上能够支持的”建议，从而打破北非的“僵局”。
    电讯说，华盛顿和伦敦认为，这样就有可能在西地中海地区拼凑成一个区域性的政治和“防务”集团来同北大西洋公约集团联系起来；它的成员将包括阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯、利比亚和西班牙。
