    Jiangxi Province's Party and Government Leading Organs at All Levels
    Seriously Solve Practical Problems in Water Conservancy Work

    (Our dispatch) In accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session's call to vigorously develop agricultural production, Party and government leading organs at all levels in Jiangxi Province are adopting various concrete measures to strengthen leadership in water conservancy work.

    Various localities have successively established and improved headquarters for farmland water conservancy construction, generally led personally by the secretaries of the prefectural party committees or commissioners, and the secretaries of the county party committees or county heads. Some districts, townships, and cooperatives have also implemented a "three-chief" (district chief, township chief, cooperative chief) responsibility system to specifically lead farmland water conservancy construction work.

    Prefectures, counties, townships, and cooperatives have all expanded their farmland water conservancy construction plans. The Gannan District Party Committee expanded its plan to increase irrigated area by 250,000 mu this winter and next spring to 400,000 mu. Some counties have expanded their water conservancy construction plans by one to two times.

    In order to realize the expanded water conservancy construction plans, various localities are actively raising water conservancy funds. Working cadres at all levels throughout the province and the broad masses of workers in factories and mines have enthusiastically donated water conservancy funds to support farmland water conservancy construction. Cadres of the Gannan District Party Committee and directly affiliated organs of the administrative office have already donated more than 2,300 yuan. Workers in various mines within Dayu County have donated more than 30,000 yuan. Cadres in more than a dozen counties in the three special districts of Ji'an, Shangrao, and Nanchang have donated more than 1 million yuan. Various localities have also drawn surplus local financial funds and locally raised grain to invest in water conservancy construction. Some agricultural cooperatives have drawn part of their public accumulation funds for water conservancy construction. Because of all possible efforts to raise funds, the Gannan Administrative District can raise 3.1 million yuan in water conservancy funds on its own, equivalent to one and a half times the water conservancy funds allocated to the district by the state. Ji'an Special District can raise more than 4 million yuan on its own. Shangrao and Nanchang Special Districts can each raise 5 million yuan on their own.

    Various localities are conscientiously implementing the policy of "running water conservancy diligently and thriftily." Some have proposed "doing two yuan's worth of work with one yuan," achieving savings in labor, materials, and expenses. In Jinxian County, the sand and pebbles used at various construction sites are all sourced locally and transported by cooperative members themselves, saving a lot of expenses. In Yiyang County, culvert pipes under five meters for reservoirs are uniformly replaced with self-fired sand pipes instead of cement pipes, saving a large amount of cement and steel.

    In order to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of water conservancy construction plans, various localities are stepping up construction preparations or starting construction ahead of schedule. At present, most counties and townships have completed the surveying and design of medium and small-sized projects, and 479 key projects across the province have been successively started.

    江西省各级党政领导机关
    认真解决水利工作的实际问题
    本报讯　江西省各级党政领导机关根据三中全会大力发展农业生产的精神，采取各种具体措施，加强水利工作的领导。
    各地相继建立和健全了兴修农田水利指挥部，一般都由地委书记或专员、县委书记或县长亲自领导。有些区乡社还实行了“三长”（区长、乡长、社长）负责制，专门领导农田水利兴修工作。
    各专、县、乡、社纷纷扩大兴修水利建设计划。赣南区党委把今冬明春增加灌溉面积二十五万亩的农田水利建设计划扩大为四十万亩。有的县扩大兴修水利计划一倍到两倍。
    为了实现扩大了的兴修水利的计划，各地正积极筹集水利资金。全省各级工作干部和厂矿广大职工为了支援农田水利建设，纷纷捐献水利资金。中共赣南区党委和行署直属各机关的干部已捐献二千三百多元。大余县境内的各矿山职工捐献三万多元。吉安、上饶、南昌等三个专区十几个县的干部捐献一百多万元。各地并抽出地方财政节余、地方自筹粮投入水利建设。有些农业社抽出部分公积金进行水利建设。因为千方百计的筹集资金，赣南行政区可自筹水利资金达三百一十万元，相当于国家拨给该区水利资金的一倍半。吉安专区可自筹四百多万元。上饶、南昌两个专区都可自筹五百万元。
    各地都认真贯彻“勤俭办水利”的方针。有的提出“一元钱办两元钱的事”做到省工省料节省开支。进贤县各工地用的沙子、卵石都由社员就地取材自己挑运，节省很多经费。弋阳县将五公尺以下的水库涵管一律用自烧的沙管代替洋灰管，节省了大批水泥钢筋。
    为了保证完成和超额完成水利兴修计划，各地都加紧施工准备或提前施工。现在绝大部分县、乡都已完成中小型工程的勘测和设计，全省并有四百七十九座重点工程已陆续施工。
