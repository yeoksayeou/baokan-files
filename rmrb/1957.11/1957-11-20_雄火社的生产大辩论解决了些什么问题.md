The great socialist debate launched by the Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative in Hong Zhao County, Shanxi Province, has increased the attendance rate of male and female members from about 70% to 85%. Recently, after discussing the Forty Articles Program and formulating a ten-year long-term plan, the socialist enthusiasm of the people immediately turned to production and construction. The wealthy middle peasants who were still waiting and watching became active, and the lazy people also cheered up and devoted themselves to the digging canals and accumulating fertilizer movement. The attendance rate of the members, even in the current agricultural slack season, reached more than 90%.

The Struggle Between Two Lines Also Exists in the Great Debate on Production and Construction

However, to make this debate a powerful driving force for promoting production is not as simple as some people imagine. This debate, for the leaders, is a thorough implementation of the mass line and the class line; for the masses, it is a broader organization and mobilization. From beginning to end, it embodies a more practical and sharper struggle between two lines on the issue of production and construction.

At the beginning of the transition to the great debate on production and construction in the Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative, the leaders underestimated the necessity of continuing to mobilize the members to speak out freely. They believed that the previous socialist debate had been relatively thorough and that nothing more could be said. However, when they asked the members to discuss the program and formulate production increase targets, everyone demanded that the stumbling blocks on the road to developing production be removed first. As a result, in three or four days, everyone spoke out on more than 1,100 opinions on production management, labor management, members' labor attitude, sideline production, and cadres' leadership style, many of which were fundamental in nature. At the same time, it also exposed the conservative thinking of "increasing production to the top" and the capitalist thinking in business principles that existed among some members.

From everyone's speaking out, two opposing opinions can be seen: the majority of poor and lower-middle peasant members advocated increasing the per-mu yield of grain in the whole cooperative from 750 jin this year to 1,500 or 1,600 jin within ten years, while some middle peasants and elderly members believed that it was not certain that it could be increased to 1,300 or 1,400 jin, and another group of young people wanted to increase the per-mu yield to 2,000 jin; most members were interested in developing agricultural production, while a part of the members focused their energy on sideline and commercial activities; poor peasants and activists pinned their hopes of increasing production on strengthening cooperative management and agricultural capital construction, while a part of the wealthy middle peasants advocated contracting production to individual households, "relying on personal ability to achieve production increase targets."

In this case, if the leaders only vaguely saw the struggle between this part of the people and that part of the people, this kind of proposition and that kind of proposition from these opinions, it is far from enough. They must also pay special attention to the fierce struggle between the old and new ideas of each member and the positive and negative factors in each proposition. This point is particularly noteworthy when analyzing the opinions and demands of wealthy middle peasants. Because the thinking of this class of wealthy middle peasants had already undergone a serious division during the socialist debate stage, some people were indeed "putting their hearts into the cooperative," some people were hesitant and eager to see a reliable way out, and some people were insincere and still missed their relatively well-off operating conditions when they worked individually. Zhang Shanzhi, a wealthy middle peasant, is one example. He is thrifty and diligent, and he also wants to run the cooperative well. This year, he gave the cooperative good ideas on cultivation techniques. However, when debating the production plan, he thought about it and still advocated contracting production to individual households. Someone criticized him and said: "You are thinking of taking the old road!" He retorted with a straight face: "Let's compare output at the end of the year. You are unwilling to contract output to individual households because you still want to work without regard for quality and just muddle through for work points." Obviously, the leaders, while seeing the negative side of their proposition, must also see their positive desire to improve cooperative management. Only in this way can they find the leading force in people's hearts that is constantly growing in this struggle, and only then can they fully understand the basis and meaning of the starting point of "firmly believing in the majority of the masses." The comrades who led the Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative to carry out this debate gradually clarified this point from the masses' speaking out, thus grasping the key to carrying out the debate and enhancing their confidence in relying on the masses to solve problems. On the one hand, they led the members to organize ten special groups for production planning, such as labor management, water conservancy and canal planning, fertilizer, diversified economy, financial management, afforestation, agricultural technology, animal husbandry, and residential planning, to sort out and enrich the problems and suggestions put forward by everyone, and to formulate plans to solve the problems step by step -- those that can be solved immediately should be solved immediately, such as digging pits for composting, dredging canals, investigating brick and tile kiln problems, cadres publicly setting the number of days to participate in labor next year and immediately actively participating in labor, etc. On the other hand, they also seriously analyzed and summarized the opinions of the masses, and organized repeated debates in small and large meetings with production teams as units on three main issues: formulating production plans, the operating principles of agricultural cooperatives, and what to rely on to achieve the plans.

The Struggle Between Two Roads in the Formulation of Production Plans is Mainly Manifested as the Struggle Between Advanced Ideas and Conservative Ideas, and Between Large-Scale Production Methods and Small-Scale Production Methods.

In the struggle between the two roads in the formulation of production plans, it is mainly manifested as the struggle between advanced ideas and conservative ideas, and between large-scale production methods and small-scale production methods. In this debate in the Xiong Huo Cooperative, those who are accustomed to looking back always feel that the output of the cooperative this year is already the highest in history, and they really dare not think about increasing it by another fold. At this time, some young people who advocated a per-mu yield of 2,000 jin used the large corn cob that had been prepared long ago to point to the provisions of the Forty Articles Program and criticized them, saying: "Oppose conservatism, and have lofty ideals!" Those old people immediately retorted angrily: "It's easy to talk, but if you work like you, carelessly and without listening to commands, I'm afraid it will be difficult to achieve even 1,000 jin!" Zhang Shunbao, a wealthy middle peasant, said that when he worked individually, he accumulated a lot of fertilizer, dug ditches to plant corn after harvesting wheat, and intercropped black beans in the cornfields, so he could harvest one more season than the cooperative now. So everyone asked in return: "You can do this when you work individually, why can't you do it in the cooperative?" He said that he saw some members not observing discipline when working, only competing for work points, and the cooperative cadres were not democratic, so he lost his energy. After a period of debate, the conclusion was: as long as the cooperative cadres follow the mass line, the cooperative improves cultivation methods, implements crop rotation, and the members treat the cooperative with the same heart and enthusiasm as when they manage their own land, Zhang Shunbao's method can play a greater role in the cooperative. Later, everyone, from the debate, on the one hand, found out the reasons for the historical record of a per-mu yield of 1,400 jin in the village, and on the other hand, referred to past experience to dig out many production increase measures: the whole cooperative will be fully irrigated in the next two years, develop ten major sources of fertilizer and increase the application of chemical fertilizers, implement crop rotation to change single cropping to double cropping, improve cultivation techniques, conquer barren beaches and poor gullies, develop a diversified economy, and improve labor management, etc. When everyone heard that the county had decided to immediately build the third main canal of the Fen River and use hydropower to generate electricity, the eyes of those who did not dare to think boldly were widened, and they felt that the target of 1,600 jin per mu in ten years proposed by the Party branch and those poor peasant members could be achieved as long as they worked hard and overcame difficulties. And those young people were criticized by the old farmers for their labor discipline, and they saw from the debate that there were still many difficulties to be overcome on the road to increasing production, so their ideas became more practical.

At this time, those wealthy middle peasants who advocated contracting production to individual households also saw clearly that only the large-scale production method of the cooperative could implement the above-mentioned production increase measures, and they believed that what their small-scale production method could do, the large-scale production method could do even better. Only then did they abandon their idea of contracting production to individual households and think more about the collective realization of the cooperative's production plan.

Is the Realization of the Ten-Year Plan Mainly Based on Agriculture, or Mainly Based on Sideline Production or Commerce?

Is the realization of the ten-year plan mainly based on agriculture, or mainly based on sideline production or commerce? This is the manifestation of the struggle between two lines in the operating principles of the Xiong Huo Cooperative.

Similarly, this struggle is not only manifested between the members and several cooperative cadres with serious capitalist ideas and behaviors, but also in the struggle between the old and new ideas of the members themselves. Last spring, in order to obtain the state's prepayment of 4,500 yuan for bricks and tiles, the cooperative cadres did not hesitate to relax agriculture and ran to Chengguan to build a brick and tile kiln. The members tasted the sweetness of the prepayment and fantasized about making more money from the brick and tile kiln, and even used livestock on the kiln during the busy farming season. Since then, the speculator Zhang Zhijian, who was in charge of sideline production, used this brick and tile kiln to embezzle and engage in capitalist activities. He sold a large amount of grain, cotton, and homespun cloth. Many members, on the one hand, suspected and dissatisfied with his extravagance in life, but on the other hand, they envied him and even learned from him. Some members also went out to do business during the busy farming season. The tenth production team bought more than 300 jin of wheat from Zhang Zhijian at a price twice as high as the market price to make noodles for sale. Even Liang Baishun, the secretary of the Party branch, patted Zhang Zhijian on the shoulder all day long and hung out with him. As a result, the state and the cooperative suffered losses, and the members did not get the benefits they had originally hoped for, while Zhang Zhijian made a fortune from it. This sharp struggle only became apparent during this great speaking out. After a fierce debate, Zhang Zhijian's true colors were revealed and he was punished by law. Those cadres and members who followed Zhang Zhijian also criticized their own thinking, and the majority of members woke up from the fog. Everyone realized that not only is individual work and cooperation a struggle between two roads, but also after joining the cooperative, there is a sharp struggle between two roads in the operating principles of the cooperative. Everyone expressed that in the future, they will unswervingly follow the correct principle of developing agriculture as the main focus and sideline production as the auxiliary, and not engaging in commercial activities to realize the production plan.

Diligence and Laziness, Thrift and Waste Become the Center of Debate, and the Great Debate Forms a Profound Socialist Labor Education

The conservative thinking has been initially overcome, and the operating principles have also been clarified. Everyone's demands are concentrated on the issue of what to rely on to realize the plan.

At this time, labor and laziness, thrift and waste became the focus of the struggle and the center of the debate. In fact, in the debate on the previous issues, the masses had already put forward sharp criticisms on those non-socialist labor attitudes and the phenomenon of lax labor discipline. This not only reflects the most essential demands of the working masses, but also shows that labor is the most core issue of production and construction and the formulation of plans. It is impossible to imagine carrying out socialist production and construction without socialist labor and without establishing a socialist labor attitude. Therefore, the socialist debate is actually a profound socialist labor education. The Xiong Huo Cooperative's debate on this issue was more acute than the previous issues, and the scope involved was also wider. Every member of the cooperative, even the lazy people and nuns who did not participate in the previous socialist debate, were involved in this debate. A strong pressure of public opinion demanded that everyone express their attitude and decide which side they would stand on in the future on the issue of labor and laziness. Liang Baishun, the secretary of the Party branch, did not work and had problems in his work and thinking. The masses refused to let him go, saying that he could not be a Communist Party member if he did not work, let alone be a branch secretary who led the masses to realize the socialist production plan. Therefore, the Party branch, under the supervision of the masses, re-elected the branch and replaced the branch secretary. Some Communist Youth League members with poor labor attitudes, such as Li Guochao, were criticized at the debate the day before, and the next day, they posted a big-character poster on the wall in front of the debate stage saying "Accept the opinions and determined to correct them," and immediately carried manure baskets and actively participated in the youth commando team to help the third production team harvest rice. Zhang Maochong, who jumped and pretended to be ill, and Zhang Mingjian, a fortune teller, could muddle through in the past, but this time the masses refused to let them go and asked them to answer the questions of what socialism relies on to eat and whether it is shameful for members not to work. They felt the loneliness of being away from labor, so they voluntarily handed over the divination books and the "magic whip," expressing their determination to participate in labor in the future. On the contrary, for those members who were thrifty and diligent in managing their families and were loyal and diligent in the cooperative, the masses praised them one after another and compared them with those lazy and selfish people. The atmosphere of running the cooperative through thrift and diligence and realizing the production plan by relying on their own strength and capital accumulation was greatly promoted.

For the wealthy middle peasants, the previous stage focused on criticizing their capitalist ideas, but now this debate has made them see a concrete socialist future; at the same time, the cooperative has accepted their reasonable suggestions and promoted their fine tradition of thrift and diligence in managing their families, so their emotions have risen significantly. They compared their mood at this moment to "simply taking a bath so happily!"

On November 7, the members of the Xiong Huo Cooperative raised their hands and passed their ten-year plan and launched a socialist labor competition. The whole village immediately appeared a production upsurge. Digging canals, accumulating fertilizer, planting trees, and repairing roads, the large and small streets were cleaned early in the morning. At this time, although the autumn leaves were falling on the banks of the Fen River, the enthusiasm for labor was like a strong bond, bringing people into the first extraordinary spring of the second five-year plan ahead of time.
