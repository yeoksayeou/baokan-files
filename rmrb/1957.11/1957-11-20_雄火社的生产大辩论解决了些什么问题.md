The great socialist debate launched by the Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative in Hong Zhao County, Shanxi Province, has increased the attendance rate of male and female members from about 70% to 85%. Recently, after discussing the Forty Articles Program and formulating a ten-year long-term plan, the socialist enthusiasm of the people immediately turned to production and construction. The wealthy middle peasants who were still waiting and watching became active, and the lazy people also cheered up and devoted themselves to the digging canals and accumulating fertilizer movement. The attendance rate of the members, even in the current agricultural slack season, reached more than 90%.

The Struggle Between Two Lines Also Exists in the Great Debate on Production and Construction

However, to make this debate a powerful driving force for promoting production is not as simple as some people imagine. This debate, for the leaders, is a thorough implementation of the mass line and the class line; for the masses, it is a broader organization and mobilization. From beginning to end, it embodies a more practical and sharper struggle between two lines on the issue of production and construction.

At the beginning of the transition to the great debate on production and construction in the Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative, the leaders underestimated the necessity of continuing to mobilize the members to speak out freely. They believed that the previous socialist debate had been relatively thorough and that nothing more could be said. However, when they asked the members to discuss the program and formulate production increase targets, everyone demanded that the stumbling blocks on the road to developing production be removed first. As a result, in three or four days, everyone spoke out on more than 1,100 opinions on production management, labor management, members' labor attitude, sideline production, and cadres' leadership style, many of which were fundamental in nature. At the same time, it also exposed the conservative thinking of "increasing production to the top" and the capitalist thinking in business principles that existed among some members.

From everyone's speaking out, two opposing opinions can be seen: the majority of poor and lower-middle peasant members advocated increasing the per-mu yield of grain in the whole cooperative from 750 jin this year to 1,500 or 1,600 jin within ten years, while some middle peasants and elderly members believed that it was not certain that it could be increased to 1,300 or 1,400 jin, and another group of young people wanted to increase the per-mu yield to 2,000 jin; most members were interested in developing agricultural production, while a part of the members focused their energy on sideline and commercial activities; poor peasants and activists pinned their hopes of increasing production on strengthening cooperative management and agricultural capital construction, while a part of the wealthy middle peasants advocated contracting production to individual households, "relying on personal ability to achieve production increase targets."

In this case, if the leaders only vaguely saw the struggle between this part of the people and that part of the people, this kind of proposition and that kind of proposition from these opinions, it is far from enough. They must also pay special attention to the fierce struggle between the old and new ideas of each member and the positive and negative factors in each proposition. This point is particularly noteworthy when analyzing the opinions and demands of wealthy middle peasants. Because the thinking of this class of wealthy middle peasants had already undergone a serious division during the socialist debate stage, some people were indeed "putting their hearts into the cooperative," some people were hesitant and eager to see a reliable way out, and some people were insincere and still missed their relatively well-off operating conditions when they worked individually. Zhang Shanzhi, a wealthy middle peasant, is one example. He is thrifty and diligent, and he also wants to run the cooperative well. This year, he gave the cooperative good ideas on cultivation techniques. However, when debating the production plan, he thought about it and still advocated contracting production to individual households. Someone criticized him and said: "You are thinking of taking the old road!" He retorted with a straight face: "Let's compare output at the end of the year. You are unwilling to contract output to individual households because you still want to work without regard for quality and just muddle through for work points." Obviously, the leaders, while seeing the negative side of their proposition, must also see their positive desire to improve cooperative management. Only in this way can they find the leading force in people's hearts that is constantly growing in this struggle, and only then can they fully understand the basis and meaning of the starting point of "firmly believing in the majority of the masses." The comrades who led the Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative to carry out this debate gradually clarified this point from the masses' speaking out, thus grasping the key to carrying out the debate and enhancing their confidence in relying on the masses to solve problems. On the one hand, they led the members to organize ten special groups for production planning, such as labor management, water conservancy and canal planning, fertilizer, diversified economy, financial management, afforestation, agricultural technology, animal husbandry, and residential planning, to sort out and enrich the problems and suggestions put forward by everyone, and to formulate plans to solve the problems step by step -- those that can be solved immediately should be solved immediately, such as digging pits for composting, dredging canals, investigating brick and tile kiln problems, cadres publicly setting the number of days to participate in labor next year and immediately actively participating in labor, etc. On the other hand, they also seriously analyzed and summarized the opinions of the masses, and organized repeated debates in small and large meetings with production teams as units on three main issues: formulating production plans, the operating principles of agricultural cooperatives, and what to rely on to achieve the plans.

The Struggle Between Two Roads in the Formulation of Production Plans is Mainly Manifested as the Struggle Between Advanced Ideas and Conservative Ideas, and Between Large-Scale Production Methods and Small-Scale Production Methods.

In the struggle between the two roads in the formulation of production plans, it is mainly manifested as the struggle between advanced ideas and conservative ideas, and between large-scale production methods and small-scale production methods. In this debate in the Xiong Huo Cooperative, those who are accustomed to looking back always feel that the output of the cooperative this year is already the highest in history, and they really dare not think about increasing it by another fold. At this time, some young people who advocated a per-mu yield of 2,000 jin used the large corn cob that had been prepared long ago to point to the provisions of the Forty Articles Program and criticized them, saying: "Oppose conservatism, and have lofty ideals!" Those old people immediately retorted angrily: "It's easy to talk, but if you work like you, carelessly and without listening to commands, I'm afraid it will be difficult to achieve even 1,000 jin!" Zhang Shunbao, a wealthy middle peasant, said that when he worked individually, he accumulated a lot of fertilizer, dug ditches to plant corn after harvesting wheat, and intercropped black beans in the cornfields, so he could harvest one more season than the cooperative now. So everyone asked in return: "You can do this when you work individually, why can't you do it in the cooperative?" He said that he saw some members not observing discipline when working, only competing for work points, and the cooperative cadres were not democratic, so he lost his energy. After a period of debate, the conclusion was: as long as the cooperative cadres follow the mass line, the cooperative improves cultivation methods, implements crop rotation, and the members treat the cooperative with the same heart and enthusiasm as when they manage their own land, Zhang Shunbao's method can play a greater role in the cooperative. Later, everyone, from the debate, on the one hand, found out the reasons for the historical record of a per-mu yield of 1,400 jin in the village, and on the other hand, referred to past experience to dig out many production increase measures: the whole cooperative will be fully irrigated in the next two years, develop ten major sources of fertilizer and increase the application of chemical fertilizers, implement crop rotation to change single cropping to double cropping, improve cultivation techniques, conquer barren beaches and poor gullies, develop a diversified economy, and improve labor management, etc. When everyone heard that the county had decided to immediately build the third main canal of the Fen River and use hydropower to generate electricity, the eyes of those who did not dare to think boldly were widened, and they felt that the target of 1,600 jin per mu in ten years proposed by the Party branch and those poor peasant members could be achieved as long as they worked hard and overcame difficulties. And those young people were criticized by the old farmers for their labor discipline, and they saw from the debate that there were still many difficulties to be overcome on the road to increasing production, so their ideas became more practical.

At this time, those wealthy middle peasants who advocated contracting production to individual households also saw clearly that only the large-scale production method of the cooperative could implement the above-mentioned production increase measures, and they believed that what their small-scale production method could do, the large-scale production method could do even better. Only then did they abandon their idea of contracting production to individual households and think more about the collective realization of the cooperative's production plan.

Is the Realization of the Ten-Year Plan Mainly Based on Agriculture, or Mainly Based on Sideline Production or Commerce?

Is the realization of the ten-year plan mainly based on agriculture, or mainly based on sideline production or commerce? This is the manifestation of the struggle between two lines in the operating principles of the Xiong Huo Cooperative.

Similarly, this struggle is not only manifested between the members and several cooperative cadres with serious capitalist ideas and behaviors, but also in the struggle between the old and new ideas of the members themselves. Last spring, in order to obtain the state's prepayment of 4,500 yuan for bricks and tiles, the cooperative cadres did not hesitate to relax agriculture and ran to Chengguan to build a brick and tile kiln. The members tasted the sweetness of the prepayment and fantasized about making more money from the brick and tile kiln, and even used livestock on the kiln during the busy farming season. Since then, the speculator Zhang Zhijian, who was in charge of sideline production, used this brick and tile kiln to embezzle and engage in capitalist activities. He sold a large amount of grain, cotton, and homespun cloth. Many members, on the one hand, suspected and dissatisfied with his extravagance in life, but on the other hand, they envied him and even learned from him. Some members also went out to do business during the busy farming season. The tenth production team bought more than 300 jin of wheat from Zhang Zhijian at a price twice as high as the market price to make noodles for sale. Even Liang Baishun, the secretary of the Party branch, patted Zhang Zhijian on the shoulder all day long and hung out with him. As a result, the state and the cooperative suffered losses, and the members did not get the benefits they had originally hoped for, while Zhang Zhijian made a fortune from it. This sharp struggle only became apparent during this great speaking out. After a fierce debate, Zhang Zhijian's true colors were revealed and he was punished by law. Those cadres and members who followed Zhang Zhijian also criticized their own thinking, and the majority of members woke up from the fog. Everyone realized that not only is individual work and cooperation a struggle between two roads, but also after joining the cooperative, there is a sharp struggle between two roads in the operating principles of the cooperative. Everyone expressed that in the future, they will unswervingly follow the correct principle of developing agriculture as the main focus and sideline production as the auxiliary, and not engaging in commercial activities to realize the production plan.

Diligence and Laziness, Thrift and Waste Become the Center of Debate, and the Great Debate Forms a Profound Socialist Labor Education

The conservative thinking has been initially overcome, and the operating principles have also been clarified. Everyone's demands are concentrated on the issue of what to rely on to realize the plan.

At this time, labor and laziness, thrift and waste became the focus of the struggle and the center of the debate. In fact, in the debate on the previous issues, the masses had already put forward sharp criticisms on those non-socialist labor attitudes and the phenomenon of lax labor discipline. This not only reflects the most essential demands of the working masses, but also shows that labor is the most core issue of production and construction and the formulation of plans. It is impossible to imagine carrying out socialist production and construction without socialist labor and without establishing a socialist labor attitude. Therefore, the socialist debate is actually a profound socialist labor education. The Xiong Huo Cooperative's debate on this issue was more acute than the previous issues, and the scope involved was also wider. Every member of the cooperative, even the lazy people and nuns who did not participate in the previous socialist debate, were involved in this debate. A strong pressure of public opinion demanded that everyone express their attitude and decide which side they would stand on in the future on the issue of labor and laziness. Liang Baishun, the secretary of the Party branch, did not work and had problems in his work and thinking. The masses refused to let him go, saying that he could not be a Communist Party member if he did not work, let alone be a branch secretary who led the masses to realize the socialist production plan. Therefore, the Party branch, under the supervision of the masses, re-elected the branch and replaced the branch secretary. Some Communist Youth League members with poor labor attitudes, such as Li Guochao, were criticized at the debate the day before, and the next day, they posted a big-character poster on the wall in front of the debate stage saying "Accept the opinions and determined to correct them," and immediately carried manure baskets and actively participated in the youth commando team to help the third production team harvest rice. Zhang Maochong, who jumped and pretended to be ill, and Zhang Mingjian, a fortune teller, could muddle through in the past, but this time the masses refused to let them go and asked them to answer the questions of what socialism relies on to eat and whether it is shameful for members not to work. They felt the loneliness of being away from labor, so they voluntarily handed over the divination books and the "magic whip," expressing their determination to participate in labor in the future. On the contrary, for those members who were thrifty and diligent in managing their families and were loyal and diligent in the cooperative, the masses praised them one after another and compared them with those lazy and selfish people. The atmosphere of running the cooperative through thrift and diligence and realizing the production plan by relying on their own strength and capital accumulation was greatly promoted.

For the wealthy middle peasants, the previous stage focused on criticizing their capitalist ideas, but now this debate has made them see a concrete socialist future; at the same time, the cooperative has accepted their reasonable suggestions and promoted their fine tradition of thrift and diligence in managing their families, so their emotions have risen significantly. They compared their mood at this moment to "simply taking a bath so happily!"

On November 7, the members of the Xiong Huo Cooperative raised their hands and passed their ten-year plan and launched a socialist labor competition. The whole village immediately appeared a production upsurge. Digging canals, accumulating fertilizer, planting trees, and repairing roads, the large and small streets were cleaned early in the morning. At this time, although the autumn leaves were falling on the banks of the Fen River, the enthusiasm for labor was like a strong bond, bringing people into the first extraordinary spring of the second five-year plan ahead of time.

    雄火社的生产大辩论解决了些什么问题
    本报记者　吕建中
    山西洪赵县雄火农业社展开社会主义大辩论后，男女社员出勤率由70％左右提高到85％；最近，经过讨论四十条纲要，制订出了十年远景规划，人们那股社会主义热劲便立刻转到生产建设上来，原来还在观望的富裕中农活跃起来了，懒惰人也振作起精神投入了挖渠、积肥运动，社员出勤率虽在当前农闲季节却达到了90％以上。
    生产建设大辩论中同样存在着两条路线的斗争
    然而要使这场辩论成为推动生产的强有力的动力，却并不像有些人想像的那末简单。这场辩论对领导者来说，是一次群众路线和阶级路线的深入贯彻；对群众来说，则是一次更广泛的组织和动员。它自始至终都在生产建设问题上体现着更实际、更尖锐的两条路线的斗争。
    雄火农业社在转入生产建设大辩论之初，领导者对继续发动社员大鸣大放的必要性是估计不足的，他们认为前一段社会主义辩论已经鸣放得比较透彻，再不会鸣放出什么来。可是当他们要社员讨论纲要、制订增产指标的时候，大家却要求首先搬掉那些发展生产路上的绊脚石。结果在三四天当中，大家便在生产管理、劳动管理、社员劳动态度、副业生产以及干部领导作风等方面鸣放出了一千一百多条意见，其中不少是带有根本性质的问题。而同时，从这里也暴露出了不少社员存在着“增产到顶”的保守思想和经营方针上的资本主义思想。
    从大家鸣放中可以看出两种对立的意见：多数贫农和下中农社员主张十年内把全社粮食亩产量由今年的七百五十斤提高到一千五六百斤，一部分中农和老年社员则认为提高到一千三四百斤也没把握，另有一批青年人则要把亩产量提高到两千斤；多数社员对发展农业生产兴趣大，一部分社员却把心劲放在副业和商业上；贫农、积极分子把增产希望寄托在加强合作社管理和农业基本建设上，而一部分富裕中农却主张包产到户，“凭个人本事来实现增产指标”。
    在这种情况下，如果领导者从这些意见中只笼统地看到这部分人和那部分人、这种主张和那种主张之间的斗争，那是很不够的，还必须特别注意到每一个社员的新旧思想、每一个主张中积极因素和消极因素之间的激烈斗争。这一点，在分析富裕中农的意见和要求时，特别值得注意。因为富裕中农这个阶层的思想在社会主义大辩论阶段就已经发生了严重分化，一部分人确实是“把心端到合作社里来了”，一部分人则瞻前顾后，急于看到可靠的出路，还有一部分人则是口服心不服，还恋念着他们单干时那套比较优裕的经营条件。富裕中农张善子就是一例。他勤俭，也想把合作社办好，今年曾在耕作技术上给合作社出过好主意，可是在辩论生产规划时，他想来想去还是主张包产到户，有人批判他说：“你这是想走回头路！”他理直气壮地反驳道：“咱们到年底比产量吧，你们不愿把产量包到户，就是还想干活不顾质量，光混工分。”很显然，领导者要在看到他们这种主张中消极的一面的同时，也看见他们要求改进合作社管理这个积极的愿望，这样才能找到这场斗争中人们内心那种不断增长着的主导力量，也才能完整地理解“坚决相信群众的大多数”这个出发点的根据和含意。领导雄火农业社开展这场辩论的同志们就是由于从群众鸣放中逐渐明确了这一点，才抓住了开展辩论的锁钥，增强了依靠群众解决问题的信心。他们一方面领导社员自己组织了劳动管理、水利渠道规划、肥料、多种经济、财务管理、绿化、农业技术、畜牧、住宅规划、文化卫生等十个生产规划专题小组，分别整理、充实大家提出的问题和建议，拟订逐步解决问题的方案——能马上解决的马上就解决，如挖坑沤肥、疏浚渠道、清查砖瓦窑问题、干部当众订出明年参加劳动日数目并立即积极参加劳动等等，另方面又认真分析和归纳群众的意见，就制订生产规划、农业社经营方针、依靠什么实现规划等三个主要问题，以生产队为单位，组织小会大会反复辩论。
    两条道路的斗争在制订生产规划当中主要表现为先进思想与保守思想、大生产方式与小生产方式之间的斗争
    两条道路的斗争在制订生产规划当中，主要表现为先进思想与保守思想、大生产方式与小生产方式之间的斗争。雄火社在这场辩论当中，那些惯于往后看的人总觉得今年社里产量已经是历史上最高的了，再提高一倍可实在不敢想。这时候，有些主张亩产两千斤的年轻人就用那个早准备好了的大玉茭穗指着四十条纲要的条文批评他们说：“反对保守主义呀，要有远大理想嘛！”那些老年人又马上气冲冲地反驳道：“说话容易，要是干活都像你们那样毛毛草草，不听指挥，恐怕连一千斤也难达到！”富裕中农张顺宝说，他单干的时候，积肥多，割了小麦刨沟种玉茭，玉茭地里再套种黑豆，这样就比现在社里的土地多收一季。于是大家就反问：“你单干能这样做，为什么在合作社里就不能？”他说，他看到有些社员干活不守纪律，光争工分，社干部又不民主，自己也就没劲了。经过一阵辩论，得出的结论是：只要社干部走群众路线，合作社改进耕作方法，实行轮作，社员也用经营自己的土地时那种心肠和积极性来对待合作社，就能把张顺宝那种办法在合作社发挥更大的作用。后来，大家又从辩论中一方面找出村里历史上出现过亩产一千四百斤的纪录的原因，另方面又参考过去的经验挖掘出许多增产措施：全社在今后二年内全部水利化、开发十大肥源增施化学肥料、实行轮作倒茬变单作为双作、提高耕作技术、征服荒滩穷沟、发展多种经济、改进劳动管理等等。当大家听到县里决定马上修建汾河三干渠和利用水力发电的时候，那些不敢大胆想的人的眼睛看得远了，他们觉得党支部和那些贫农社员提出十年内亩产一千六百斤的指标，只要好好劳动，克服困难，倒也有把握实现。而那些年轻人在劳动纪律上受到老农的指责，又从辩论中看到了增产路上还存在着不少需要克服的困难，他们的想法也就实际得多了。
    这时候，那些主张包产到户的富裕中农，也看清了只有合作社的大生产方式才有条件实行上述那些增产措施，并且相信他们那种小生产方式能做到的事，大生产方式更能做到，他们才放弃了自己那包产到户的主张，更多地为集体实现合作社的生产规划着想了。
    实现十年规划以农业为主？还是以副业或者商业为主？
    实现十年规划是以农业为主，还是以副业或者商业为主？这是两条路线的斗争在雄火社经营方针上的表现。
    同样，这场斗争不仅表现在社员群众和几个有严重资本主义思想行为的社干部之间，而且也表现在社员自己的新旧思想的斗争上。去年春天，社干部为了捞到国家四千五百元的砖瓦预付定金，便不惜放松农业，又跑到城关建立了一座砖瓦窑。社员们尝到点预付定金的甜头，更幻想靠砖瓦窑多发点外财，在农忙时也把牲口抽到窑上使用。从此负责副业生产的投机分子张志坚，便利用这座砖瓦窑贪污捣鬼，发展资本主义，他大量贩卖粮食、棉花和土布。许多社员一面对他在生活上的挥霍发生了怀疑和不满，一面却又羡慕他，甚至跟他学样。有的社员在农忙时也出去做生意。第十生产队以高出市价一倍的价钱，从张志坚手里买来三百多斤小麦做挂面卖，甚至党支部书记梁百顺也成天拍张志坚的肩膀，和他在一起混。结果，国家和合作社吃了亏，社员们也没有得到自己原来所希望的那种好处，而张志坚却从中大发其财。这场尖锐的斗争，直到这次大鸣大放才表面化起来。经过一场激烈的辩论，张志坚原形毕露，并受到了法律处分，那些追随张志坚的干部和社员也批判了自己的思想，而广大社员也才从迷雾中清醒过来。大家认识到了不仅单干与合作是两条道路的斗争，而入社后在合作社的经营方针上也有两条道路的尖锐斗争。大家表示今后要坚定不移地遵循着以发展农业为主，副业为辅，不进行商业活动这个正确方针来实现生产规划。
    勤劳和懒惰、节俭和浪费成为辩论的中心，大辩论形成一种深刻的社会主义劳动教育
    保守思想初步克服了，经营方针也明确了，大家的要求便集中到依靠什么实现规划这个问题上来。
    这时候，劳动与懒惰，勤俭与浪费便成了斗争的焦点和辩论的中心。事实上在前面几个问题的辩论当中，群众对那些非社会主义的劳动态度以及劳动纪律松弛等现象就已经提出了尖锐的批评。这不仅反映了劳动群众的最本质的要求，同时也说明了：劳动，这是生产建设，制订规划的最核心的问题。不能想像进行社会主义生产建设可以离开社会主义劳动，可以不建立社会主义的劳动态度。因此社会主义大辩论实际上也就是一次深刻的社会主义劳动教育。雄火社辩论这个问题的时候比前几个问题更加尖锐，涉及面也更加广泛，社里的每一个成员，甚至没有参加前一段社会主义大辩论的懒汉和尼姑都被卷进这场辩论中来了。一种强烈的群众舆论压力要求每个人都得表示自己的态度，都得在劳动和懒惰这个问题上决定自己今后站在哪一边。党支部书记梁百顺不劳动，工作和思想上有毛病，群众不肯放过他，说不劳动就不能当共产党员，更不能做领导群众实现社会主义生产规划的支部书记。于是党支部便在群众的监督下改选了支部，撤换了支部书记。有些劳动态度不好的共青团员如李国朝头天在辩论会上受了批判，第二天就在辩论台前的墙壁上贴出“接受意见，决心改正”的大字报，并马上背起了粪筐，积极参加青年突击队帮助第三生产队割稻。跳神装病的张毛虫、算卦先生张明俭，过去还可以混一混，这回群众更不肯放过他们，要他们答复社会主义靠什么吃饭、社员不劳动羞耻不羞耻的问题。他们感到了离开劳动的孤独，便自动交出了卦书和
  “神鞭”，表示今后参加劳动的决心。相反的，对于那些勤俭持家、在社里忠实勤劳的社员，群众纷纷提出来表扬他们，拿他们和那些懒惰自私的人做对比。靠勤俭办社，靠自己的力量和资金积累实现生产规划的风气大大发扬。
    对于富裕中农，前一段着重批判了他们的资本主义思想，而现在这场辩论却使他们看到了具体的社会主义前途；同时合作社又接受了他们的合理建议，发扬了他们勤俭持家的优良传统，因此他们的情绪显著地高涨起来，他们把此刻的心情比作“简直像洗了个澡那样痛快！”
    11月7日，雄火社的社员们举手通过了他们的十年规划，开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，全村立刻就出现了生产热潮。挖渠、积肥、植树、修路，一个早上就把大小街道打扫得干干净净。这时候，汾河岸上虽然秋叶飘零，但劳动热情却像一条强有力的纽带，提前把人们带进了第二个五年计划的第一个不平常的春天。
