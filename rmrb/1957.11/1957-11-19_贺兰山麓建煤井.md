    Coal Mine Built at the Foot of Helan Mountain
    At the end of October, the construction of a pair of modern inclined shafts with an annual output of 300,000 tons began in the Shizuishan coalfield newly discovered on the eastern foot of the Helan Mountains in northeastern Gansu Province. These inclined shafts are expected to be completed in the first half of 1959.
    Shizuishan is connected to more than a dozen mining areas such as Wuda, forming the Zhuozi Helan Mountain large coalfield with a coal-bearing area of more than 500 square kilometers. This coalfield has a complete range of coal types and excellent coal quality, and can be used to produce coking coal.
    Shizuishan faces the Yellow River, and the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, which is under construction, will pass through here, making land and water transportation convenient. The industrial coal needs of Lanzhou, Baotou and other places can be solved from here.

    贺兰山麓建煤井
    10月底，在甘肃省东北部贺兰山东麓新发现的石咀山煤田上，一对年产三十万吨的现代化斜井开始兴建。这对斜井预计1959年上半年建成。
    石咀山同乌达等十几个矿区相联，构成了藏煤面积达五百多平方公里的棹子贺兰山大煤田。这个煤田的煤种齐全，煤质优良，可以炼焦炭。
    石咀山面临黄河，正在修筑的包兰铁路将从这儿通过，水陆交通都方便。兰州、包头等地的工业用煤问题都可以从这里得到解决。
