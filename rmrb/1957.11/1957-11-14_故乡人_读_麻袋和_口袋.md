    Fellow Villager
    ——Reading "'Hemp Sack' and 'Pocket'"
    In the evening, the department held a meeting to listen to a rightist’s self-criticism. After the meeting, on the way back to the dormitory, I felt very cold because I wasn’t wearing enough clothes. Because I grew up in Chahar, as soon as the weather turned cold, I immediately thought of my hometown; if I were there, I would be wearing cotton-padded clothes and a leather coat. Lying in bed at home, it evoked memories of my hometown. I wondered how the socialist debate was going in my hometown?
    Since I started working, I have been constantly concerned about the situation in my hometown, and I often contact Comrade Guo Binghua, the township instructor. The village's advanced agricultural producers' cooperative was established during the upsurge of agricultural socialism, and it has been more than a year now.
    When I returned to my hometown last summer, the township had just installed a telephone. I used this telephone to call the county's cultural section and invited Hou Bao (head of the village theater troupe, a master of快板 [clapper talk]) to make the first phone call for the villagers. The villagers present were very happy, asking questions and touching the phone.
    I picked up the People's Daily that I hadn't finished reading during the day, and suddenly found an article "'Hemp Sack' and 'Pocket'" on the eighth page. In my hometown village, there are two people, one called "Hemp Sack" and the other called "Pocket," so it caught my special attention. I read it from beginning to end in one breath. Sure enough, the signature at the end of the article was my hometown – Da Ge Da Village. I sat up excitedly, not wanting to sleep at all.
    Jia Chang (Pocket) mentioned in the article is indeed the first farmer in the village to stand up after liberation. Uncle Jia Chang’s eyes were ruined from frying naked oats for the landlord before liberation. The landlord not only didn't pay him, but also drove him out of the house in the end, so Uncle Jia Chang had to beg for food. After liberation, Uncle Jia Chang joined the agricultural producers' cooperative, and finally had something to rely on for the rest of his life. His physical strength is not very good, and his eyes are blind. His wife is a mute woman, only the children are energetic. However, last year, he not only received enough grain to eat, but also received more than seventy yuan in cash, which was really unexpected for him.
    My family also stood up after liberation. From junior high school to high school graduation, most of my expenses were supported by the Party and the government. At school, I have always received a people's scholarship, and I also received travel subsidies when I went home for vacation. Now my second younger sister is already in the second grade of junior high school. After I graduated, the Party and the government immediately introduced me to a job. Now I can not only rely on my own salary to live, but also solve my second younger sister's tuition problem. Therefore, the people of our Da Ge Da Village are full of gratitude to the Party and are willing to listen to the Party and follow the Party. I know the people written in "'Hemp Sack' and 'Pocket'" very well. After reading the description, I felt like I was in that smoky little house, and I seemed to be sitting on the adobe bed with my fellow villagers, listening to their debate. I wish I could also stand there and reason with people like "Pocket"….

### 故乡人——读“‘麻袋’和‘口袋’”

    故乡人
    ——读“‘麻袋’和‘口袋’”
    晚上科里开会，听一个右派分子的检讨。散会后，在回宿舍的路上，因为衣服穿得不多，感到非常的冷。因为我是在察北长大的，所以天气一冷，立刻就联想到自己的家乡，若是在那里，棉衣、皮袄又上身了。回家躺在床上，又引起了我对家乡的回忆。不知家乡的社会主义大辩论怎样了？
    自从参加工作后，我时刻关心着家乡的情况，经常与乡指导员郭秉华同志联系。村里的高级农业生产合作社是在农业社会主义高潮中建立的，至今也已一年多了。
    去年夏天回乡时，乡里就增设了电话，我当时就用这部电话机与县里的文化科，给村里的农民侯宝（村剧团团长，快板大家）叫来了第一个电话。在场的乡亲们，都你问问，他摸摸地高兴非常。
    我把白天没看完的人民日报拿起来，突然在第八版上发现了一篇“‘麻袋’和‘口袋’”的文章。在我家乡的村里，正有两个人，一个叫“麻袋”一个叫“口袋”，因此它引起了我的特别注意，一口气从头看到尾。果然文后署名是我的故乡——大圪垯村。我兴奋地坐起来，简直不想睡了。
    文中提的贾昌（口袋）的确是解放后村里第一个翻身的农民。贾昌伯伯，由于解放前给财主家炒莜麦，把眼睛烘坏了，地主除了不给工资，最后还把他赶出门外，贾昌伯伯只得要饭吃。解放后，贾昌伯伯参加了农业生产合作社，终身才有了依靠。他的体力并不很好，眼睛又瞎，妻子是个哑女人，只有孩子们还精神。可是他在去年，不但分到足够吃的粮食，而且还分了七十多块钱现款，这实在是他意想不到的。
    我的家也是在解放后翻了身的。我从初中到高中毕业，大部分的经济都是依靠党和政府的帮助。在学校里，我一直受到人民助学金的补助，放假回家，也有路费补助。现在我二妹也已经初中二年级了。我毕业后，党和政府立刻给我介绍了工作。我现在不仅可以依靠自己的工资生活，而且还可以解决我二妹的学费问题，因此我们大圪垯村的人们对党都充满了感激，并且愿意听党的话跟着党走的。“‘麻袋’和‘口袋’”里写的人，我都很熟悉，看了那描写，我仿佛置身在那充满了烟气的小屋里，我好像就和我的同乡们挤坐在土炕上，听着他们的辩论，我恨不得也站在那里跟“口袋”那样的人讲讲道理……。
