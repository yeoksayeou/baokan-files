Three Ways to Pass the Test
　　Liubing

　　I previously talked about "two types of people passing the test," and now I'll discuss "three ways to pass the test."

　　"Three ways to pass the test" was proposed by a businessman. He said: "One way is like Meng Changjun passing the Hangu Pass, using petty tricks and sneaking through. Another is like Wu Zixu passing the Zhaoguan Pass, where one's hair turns white from anxiety and pain in order to pass. The third is like Guan Yu passing the five passes and slaying six generals, a thoroughly enjoyable experience."

　　The "socialist test" is different from "Hangu Pass" and "Zhaoguan Pass." Meng Changjun and Wu Zixu's passing the test were both about "exiting the pass." Meng Changjun was originally trapped in the State of Qin. By sneaking through the Hangu Pass, he left the State of Qin, and even if the Qin soldiers pursued him, he would have nothing to fear. Therefore, petty tricks played a significant role. If, after passing the Hangu Pass, he was still within Qin's sphere of influence, these petty tricks would likely be of no use.

　　Passing the socialist test, however, is about "entering the pass." Before passing the test, one is based on capitalism; after passing the test, one enters a socialist world. Precisely because of this, passing the test requires changing one's stance: "Break with the capitalist stance and establish a socialist stance." With a socialist stance, one has passed the test and can travel freely; if one still clings to the capitalist stance, even if one sneaks through, one will still find it difficult to move forward. As for "stance," even the seventy-two transformations won't be able to deceive, let alone petty tricks!

　　Then, is it okay to still cling to the capitalist stance and not pass this test? No, it is not. The "land" of capitalism has long been completely owned by socialism, so there is no place for capitalism to stand. This is called having no way to retreat. If one doesn't have the ability to go to heaven or enter the earth, one still has to pass this test.

　　Aren't there still people who "bring their reactionary stance into the coffin"? There will be, but only a very few. They will be trapped in deep contradictions within the socialist kingdom until they die of old age, with no joy in life. Moreover, this will clearly deceive no one. If one wants to live this life happily, one must change one's stance; there is no other way to go.

　　To "pass the five passes and slay six generals, thoroughly enjoyably," is certainly a great thing. However, people's transformation always requires a necessary process. Especially since this is a "complete transformation." Because what is being "slain" is ultimately one's original stance, no matter how good the swordsmanship is, one must first put in some effort. For the majority of bourgeois elements, everything needs to be learned from scratch. There's no rushing this.

　　If one doesn't recognize this point, and underestimates the arduousness and meticulousness of the transformation, it will lead to a lack of long-term transformation plans. One relaxes as soon as there is some progress, leaving room for the capitalist stance to find refuge and revive within oneself. When one discovers the contradiction with socialism, one becomes greatly disappointed and loses confidence, which is not good for anyone or anything.

　　Since that's the case, should we just let it be, and wait until it gets better whenever it gets better? No, that won't work either. "Letting it be" will never "break" or "slay" it. Here, the conscious efforts of the person passing the test still play a major role. Whether one can "break" and "slay," or the speed at which one does so, still depends on the individual's awareness of self-transformation and the degree of effort put in.

　　I believe that the vast majority of bourgeois elements can enter this socialist gate. However, many of them do need to go through a relatively long period of self-transformation, with contradictions, struggles, and pain in the transformation, but also with the joy and satisfaction of overcoming each contradiction and winning each struggle. Following this path will gradually transform them into socialist new people.

　　Those who aspire to pass the test, please do not avoid contradictions and struggles, do not be impatient, do not be afraid of pain, and have long-term plans. Moreover, strive for the leadership of the Communist Party and the help of the working people in your transformation. Because the abilities of bourgeois elements are really very limited.

### 三种过关法

    三种过关法
  　流冰
    先前谈过“两种过关人”，现在来谈“三种过关法”。
      “三种过关法”，是一个工商业者提出来的。他说：“一种是孟尝君过函谷关式的过关，是鸡鸣狗盗，蒙混过关的。一种是伍子胥过昭关式的过关。为了过关，头发发白，既急又痛。一种是关云长式的过关，是过五关斩六将，痛痛快快的”。
    “社会主义关”是不同于“函谷关”、“昭关”的。孟尝君、伍子胥的过关，都是“出关”。孟尝君原先身陷秦国，混过函谷关，就离开了秦国，即使秦兵追来，也就一无所惧了，因此鸡鸣狗盗便起了极大作用。设使过了函谷关，仍属秦的势力范围，这鸡鸣狗盗怕就无济于事。
    过社会主义关却是“入关”。没有过关以前，此身是立足于资本主义的，过关以后，便进入了一个社会主义世界。正因为这样，过关必须改变立场。“破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场”。有了社会主义立场，也就过了关，便可畅行天下；仍然坚持资本主义立场，即使混过关，仍然是寸步难行。关于“立场”，即使有着七十二变的神法也蒙混不了，何况区区小技哉！
    那末，仍然坚持资本主义立场，不过这一关，行不行呢？不行。资本主义的“土地”，早已尽为社会主义所有，那里还有资本主义立足之地。这叫作后退无路，倘没有上天和入地之术，这一关还是必须要过的。
    不是还有“把反动立场带进棺材”去的人吗？会有的，但只是极少数。他们将会在社会主义王国里，身陷重重矛盾之中以至老死，再没有什么生活的乐趣可言。而且，这也将是明明白白蒙混不了任何人的。倘欲快此一生，势必要改变立场，别无其他道路可走。
    “过五关斩六将，痛痛快快的”过关。当然是一件大好事。不过人的改变总要有一个必需的过程。何况这是“脱胎换骨”。因为这“斩”的究竟是他本身原有的立场，刀法再好，也必须先下一番功夫；资产阶级分子中的多数人，更是须要件件从头学起。这是急也没奈何的。
    倘不认清这点，把改造的艰巨和细致看轻了，就反会使自己缺乏长期改造的打算，稍有进步便松懈下来，给资本主义立场，在自己身上留下了避难和复活的余地，等一发现与社会主义的矛盾时，便又大失所望，反而失去信心，倒是对人对事都没有好处。
    既然如此，就由它去吧，什么时候变好了算什么时候行不行呢？也不行。“由它去”就永远无法“破”掉它，“斩”掉它。这里，过关者自觉地努力，仍还起大作用。能否“破”和“斩”或其速度的快慢，仍还决定于本人自我改造的自觉性如何，努力的程度如何。
    我以为，资产阶级分子的绝大多数，都能进入社会主义这一关。不过，他们确实有很多人，必须经历一个较长时期的自我改造，在改造中有矛盾，有斗争，有痛苦，但也有着每一矛盾克服后，和每一斗争胜利后的欢欣和快慰，沿着这样的道路，将使自己逐步转化为社会主义新人。
    有志于过关者，请勿逃避矛盾和斗争，不要发急，不要怕痛，要有长期打算；而且要力求共产党的领导和劳动人民对自己改造的帮助。因为，资产阶级分子的这种本领，实在是有限的很。
