    Fast Improvement, Good Improvement Three Years and Three Days
    The workers of the Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory, who had been longing for an automatic stopping machine for three years, got to use it on the third day after putting up a big-character poster.
    The inability to detect broken threads from dense strands was a constant source of distress for the workers operating cotton and wool machines in this factory. Despite great effort, they could not avoid about 10% of substandard and waste products.
    As early as 1954, the workers had heard that technician Wang Dewu was about to successfully develop a machine that could automatically detect broken threads, but then there was no further news. Recently, with regret and anxiety, the workers put up a series of questioning big-character posters: "Where did the automatic stopping machine go?" "The leadership probably forgot about it completely, but we've been thinking about it all along!"
    These eye-catching big-character posters made the workshop leaders realize that a "half-hearted" work style had led to alienation from the masses. Zhang Baoyu, the secretary of the workshop Party branch, immediately convened a discussion with the old workers who had originally participated in the trial production of the new machine. They found that Wang Dewu had acted arbitrarily when encountering difficulties in repeated experiments, refusing to adopt other people's suggestions. Later, others were no longer willing to help him, and he himself became discouraged. The branch secretary explained the urgent demands of the masses to the old workers, and on the spot, five or six skilled fitters and maintenance workers volunteered to help Wang Dewu continue the trial production. The next day, the old workers re-equipped the automatic stopping machine with discarded materials. However, a malfunction occurred during the test run. At this time, the enthusiastic workers invited Kang Yu, an old electrician from another type of work, to help Zhang Guangqing discover and correct the problem of the inductor's wire being too long. Thus, quickly, a brand-new automatic stopping machine was installed and began production.
    Now, the situation where workers operating cotton and wool machines had to hunch over, staring intently at the strands and still unable to find the broken thread, is no longer seen. On the new automatic stopping machine, they can see the milky white light bulb showing a red light, indicating where a broken thread has occurred.
    Cannot Wait for the Fourth Stage
    The staff and workers of the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Textile Factory raised more than 8,000 suggestions during the airing of views movement, more than half of which were related to the work style of cadres. At the beginning, some cadres were not very determined to improve their work style, wanting to wait until the fourth stage of the rectification campaign to examine their thoughts and then solve the problems.
    However, the factory director and the Party committee secretary believed that they could not wait. They first resolved to take the lead in drastically improving their leadership style. For example, some workers criticized the factory director and the Party committee secretary for not showing their work permits when entering the factory and for using the factory's cars for personal matters, etc. They made public self-criticisms and immediately corrected these behaviors. Some old workers criticized the Party committee secretary for being aloof and not going to the workshops, so the Party committee secretary regularly went to the workshops, participated in physical labor, and also met with groups of old workers several times to make self-criticisms and listen to their opinions on production.
    The leading cadres' actions in taking the lead in improving their work style first influenced the general middle-level cadres in the factory. In the preparatory workshop of the first workshop, workers posted more than fifty big-character posters about the workshop director, Tang Lianguan, calling him a "first-class big bureaucrat." At first, Tang Lianguan thought: Most of these opinions are incorrect, I'll deal with them later! Later, when he saw that the factory director and the Party committee secretary were all humbly correcting their shortcomings, and the factory director and the Party general branch secretary were also encouraging him to face his own shortcomings, he then sought out the workers who had posted the big-character posters one by one to make self-criticisms and paid attention to contacting the masses in his actual work. The workshop workers were very satisfied; the workers who had originally called him a "first-class big bureaucrat" even apologized to him, saying that the big-character posters they wrote were excessive.
    Recently, while rectifying and improving, the entire factory mobilized all staff and workers to elect representatives to inspect the work of rectifying and improving; the survey results showed that the masses believed that the work style of 80% to 90% of the cadres had improved satisfactorily.
    The Masses Handle Matters of the Masses
    Among the 590 opinions raised by the staff and workers of the Jiang'an Railway Station in Wuhan during the airing of views movement, 92 were related to the issue of applying for relief funds. The employees who applied had their own reasons.
    But who should be given relief? How can we ensure fairness and reasonableness? These issues often troubled the leadership of the station. In the past, every time relief funds were distributed, there was always a group of people grumbling and feeling dissatisfied.
    In order to resolve this issue well, the leaders of the Jiang'an Railway Station were determined to rely on the masses and let the staff and workers form an investigation team to investigate in all directions. The leaders also revealed all the details to the investigation team: how much relief money the station had, how many people applied for relief, what the principles of relief were, etc.
    The investigation team visited the homes of the employees who applied for relief and their neighbors; the governments of the hometowns of some employees also provided information. In this way, who was truly in difficulty and who was not thrifty in their daily lives became clear to the employees participating in the investigation.
    At the staff and worker representative meeting held at the Jiang'an Railway Station, the investigation team presented a preliminary relief list. After extensive discussion, out of the 92 employees who originally applied for relief, only 38 were determined to need long-term relief and temporary relief; those employees whose applications were not approved were also convinced and satisfied, and many of them voluntarily withdrew their requests for relief.
    When summarizing their experiences, the leaders of the Jiang'an Railway Station said: This approach not only solved the problem of applying for relief funds, but also educated the masses on frugality and managing their households.
    Unveiling the Mystery of the Straw Rope Machine
    The Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory recently merged the production, planning, and sales sections into one business section. After the new business section was established, it received 142 letters from customers transferred from the original sales section, many of which were urging the delivery of straw rope machines.
    When the people in the business section started to handle these letters, they tallied the order numbers for the straw rope machines, which totaled 239 units for the entire year. Then they tallied the finished products and found that 400 straw rope machines had already been put into the warehouse. Before the merger, the sales section not only did not deliver these straw rope machines to the customers who had ordered them, but also asked the production section to rush to produce 700 straw rope machines in the fourth quarter. This made it difficult for everyone to understand.
    After research and investigation, it turned out that the sales section did not read the customers' letters carefully, and treated the letters urging delivery as new orders. One customer originally ordered 100 straw rope machines, and when the customer sent a letter urging delivery, the sales section counted it as 200 orders; when they sent two letters urging delivery, it became 300 orders. Adding them up letter by letter, the production task for the straw rope machines became a tense issue. Because of this reason, the sales section also turned down several customers, saying, "We don't have time to produce them this year. If you want to order, you'll have to wait until next year."
    After checking the warehouse and other work, it was found that there were many similar jokes. Many goods were urgently needed by customers, but there were many stockpiles in the warehouse; the sales section often shouted to the outside world that "we don't have time to produce," but the workshops often stopped work waiting for materials. Because they often could not deliver on time, customers had many complaints and many cooperative relationships were interrupted. What was the reason? The factory负责人said: The division of labor was too detailed, and there was overstaffing. Usually, when the sales section received a task, it handed it over to the planning section, the planning section handed it over to the production section, the production section handed it over to the workshop, the workshop distributed it to the workers, and the workers produced the goods and sent them to the warehouse; when people wanted the goods, they were kicked from one section to another, and production was managed in this "one-way" manner, with no communication between each other. After the new business section was established, it processed 142 letters from customers and over 15,000 yuan worth of stockpiled materials in the warehouse in six days. The original decision to increase equipment and work overtime was not only no longer necessary after communication and tapping potential, but also was able to complete the annual task ahead of schedule in early December. The people in the new business section only accounted for half the number of people in the original three sections.
    The Motor Room Has Changed
    More than 87% of the more than 16,000 feasible suggestions raised by the staff and workers of the Transportation Department of Anshan Iron and Steel during the airing of views movement have been dealt with after entering the rectification stage; among them, there are hundreds of major issues that have been unresolved for a long time.
    The electric locomotive repair section of this department has a motor room of more than 100 square meters. Because there was no cement floor, the ground inside the room was uneven and dusty, which affected the safety of the motors; more importantly, the three repair and test locomotive engines could not be installed because of this, and they had been idle for a long time, affecting the operating rate of the vehicles. The staff and workers were very concerned about this matter. For two years, the staff and workers had raised the issue of repairing the floor and installing the machines to the leaders more than once, but they were delayed because the basic construction department did not have time to contract, and the department did not have cement workers and installation workers, etc.; even after the representatives repeatedly raised the issue at the staff and worker representative meeting of this department, the leaders only said, "This project involves a wide range of issues, it's too difficult to handle, it can't be solved." During the airing of views movement, many workers sharply raised the old issue again, which aroused the attention of the leaders. They no longer waited for outside assistance, and immediately convened old workers and technicians to study and determine to do it themselves. They sent people to raise more than 40 tons of cement, sand, and other materials from outside, the technicians of the unit drew the machine installation drawings, and more than 100 people in the entire section also went to work early and returned late, volunteering to participate in the project to change the motor room in their spare time. As a result, in less than two weeks, they changed the old face of the motor room. The staff and workers wrote an article on the blackboard newspaper entitled "The Rectification Upsurge Has Changed the Face of Our Motor Room." After more than ten days, they were still reluctant to erase it. (Xinhua News Agency special)

    改得快　改得好	三年和三天
    太原晋生纺织厂的工人们渴望三年的自动停车机，在最近贴出大字报的第三天就使用上了。
    从稠密的股线中看不出断线的头绪，是这个厂操作棉毛机的工人时时感到苦恼的事情。尽管费了很大的精力，也无法避免10％左右的次品和废品。
    早在1954年，工人们就听说技术员王得武快要试制成功能自动发现断线的机器，但是后来却没有声息了。最近，工人们怀着惋惜而又焦急的心情提出了一连串质问的大字报：“自动停车机那里去了？”“领导上大概忘到九霄云外，而我们还一直想着呢！”
    这些引人注目的大字报，使车间领导猛省到
  “虎头蛇尾”的工作作风造成了脱离群众的恶果。车间党支部书记张宝玉当天召集原来参加试制新机器的老工人座谈，发现王得武在屡次试验中遇到困难时一意孤行，不肯采纳别人的建议，后来别人也再不愿意为他帮忙了，他自己也消沉了。支部书记向老工人说清了群众的迫切要求，当场就有五、六名熟练钳工和保全工主动提出要帮助王得武继续试制。第二天老工人又用遗弃了的器材重新装备了自动停车机。但是，在试车中又发生了故障。这时，热情沸腾的工人们从别的工种里请来老电工康玉，帮助张光清发现和矫正了引力包电线过长的毛病。于是，很快地，一台崭新的自动停车机安装起来并开始生产了。
    现在，再也看不见操作棉毛机的工人佝偻着腰背、凝神注目着股线还找不到断线头的情形了。他们在新的自动停车机上看到乳白色的电灯泡现出红光，就知道哪里发生了断线事故。
    不能等第四阶段
    国营上海第十七棉纺织厂职工在鸣放中共提出八千多条意见，其中半数以上是有关干部作风的。开始的时候，有的干部对改进作风决心不大，想等到整风第四阶段检查思想时再来解决。
    但是厂长和党委书记认为不能等。他们首先下决心带头狠狠地改进领导作风。如有的工人批评厂长、党委书记进厂不出示工作证，办私事也坐厂里的小汽车等等，他们都作了公开检讨，并且立即在行动中改正。有的老工人批评党委书记高高在上，不下车间，党委书记就定期下车间和参加体力劳动，还几次分批找老工人座谈，向他们检讨，并且听取老工人对生产的意见。
    领导干部带头改进作风的行动，首先影响到厂内的一般中层干部。第一工场准备车间的工人在鸣放中对车间主任汤廉官贴了五十多张大字报，称他是“一等一级大官僚”。汤廉官开始时想：这些意见绝大部分不正确，等将来再说吧！后来他见到厂长、党委书记都虚心改正缺点，厂长、党总支书记又都鼓励他正视自己的缺点，于是便逐一地找了贴大字报的工人进行检讨，并且在实际工作中注意联系群众。车间工人很满意；原来称他是“一等一级大官僚”的工人，还特地向他表示歉意，说自己写的大字报过火了。
    最近，全厂在边整边改的同时，发动全厂职工选出代表检查了边整边改工作；调查结果，群众认为有80％到90％的干部作风改得令人满意。
    群众的事情群众办
    武汉江岸车站职工在鸣放阶段提出的五百九十条意见中，有关申请救济金的问题就占了九十二条。提出申请的职工都有自己的理由。
    但是应该救济谁呢？怎样才能做到公平合理呢？这些问题常常使这个站的领导方面感到棘手。过去每次分发救济金，总有一批人叽叽咕咕，心里不服。
    为了使这个问题解决得好，江岸车站领导下决心依靠群众，让职工组成调查组四出查访。领导上还向调查组交了底：车站有多少救济金，有多少人申请救济，救济的原则是什么，等等。
    调查组访问了申请救济的职工家庭和左邻右舍；有的职工家乡所在地的政府也作了情况介绍。这样，谁真正有困难，谁平日生活不节俭，参加调查的职工都一清二楚。
    在江岸车站召开的职工代表大会上，调查组提出了一个初步的救济名单。经过广泛讨论以后，原来申请救济的九十二名职工，只有三十八名确定需要长期救济和临时救济；那些没有被通过的申请救济的职工也口服心服，并且有许多人自动撤回了申请救济的要求。
    江岸车站领导人在总结经验的时候说：这种作法不仅把申请救济金的问题解决了，而且对群众进行了一次活生生的勤俭持家的教育。
    揭破了草绳机之谜
    苏州农业机械厂最近把生产、计划、供销三课，合并成一个业务课。新的业务课成立以后，接到原供销课移交下来的一百四十二封客户的来信，其中有好些信是催索草绳机的。
    业务课的人在着手处理这些信件时，把草绳机的订货数字统计一下，全年一共是二百三十九台；再把生产成品进行统计，发现已经有四百台草绳机入了仓库。合并以前，供销课不但不把这些草绳机交给订户，而且还要生产课在第四季度赶制七百台草绳机。这使大家很难理解。
    经过研究和追查，原来供销课对客户的来信，没有细看，把催货的当作订货的。有一个客户原订一百台草绳机，客户来一封催货的信，供销课就算作二百台订货，来两封催货的信，就成了三百台订货了。这样一封又一封地加起来，草绳机的生产任务就成了紧张的问题。因为这个缘故，供销课还回掉好几家订户，说“今年来不及生产，要订，就得明年交货。”
    经过清理仓库和其他工作的检查，发现类似的笑话还很多。好些货，订户催得急，仓库里却积压很多；供销课常对外喊“来不及生产”，车间里却经常停工待料。因为经常不能按期交货，订户意见很多，许多协作关系中断了。什么道理呢？厂的负责人说：分工太细，人浮于事。平时供销课接到任务，交给计划课，计划课交到生产课，生产课交到车间，车间分配给工人，工人生产好了送进仓库；人家要货也是这课踢到那课，一直这样“单行线”式的管理生产，互相从不通气。新的业务课成立以后，六天中处理了一百四十二封客户的来信和一万五千多元的仓库积存物资。原来决定增加设备和加班加人的任务，经过互相通气和挖掘潜力，不但不再增加，而且还能提前在12月初完成全年任务。新的业务课的人，只有原来三课人数的一半。
    马达室变样了
    鞍钢运输部鸣放中职工提出的一万六千多条可行的意见，转入整改以后87％以上已经处理了；其中有数百个是长期悬而未决的重大问题。
    这个部的电机车修理段有一个一百多平方公尺的马达室。因为没有水泥地坪，室内地面坎坷不平，灰尘飞扬，影响着马达的安全；更重要的，是三台检修试验机车发动机的机器因此无法安装，长期闲置，影响着车辆的作业率。职工们很关心这件事。两年来，职工们不止一次地向领导上提出要修地坪、安机器，但是都因基本建设部门没有时间承包，本部门又没有水泥工和安装工等困难而被拖延下来了；甚至在这个部的职工代表大会上代表们再三提出以后，领导上也只是说“这工程牵涉面很广，太棘手呵，无法解决”。鸣放中许多工人又把老问题尖锐地提出来，这才引起了领导方面的重视。他们不再等待外援了，立即召集老工人和技术人员研究确定自己动手干。他们派人从外边筹集了四十多吨水泥、砂石等材料，本单位技术员画好了机器安装图，全段一百多人也早出晚归，利用业余时间志愿地参加了改变马达室的工程。结果，只用不到两星期的时间，便把马达室的旧面貌改变了。职工们在黑板报上以“整改高潮改变了我们马达室的面貌”为题写了一篇稿子。过了十多天，他们还舍不得擦去。　（新华社专稿）
