Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 6th. The joint session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet's Council of the Union and Council of Nationalities celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution was held today at 10:00 AM in the Luzhniki Palace of Sports, in an atmosphere of solemnity, high political enthusiasm, and great proletarian internationalist unity.

The Lenin Stadium today was adorned in festive attire, presenting a solemn and dignified atmosphere. Red flags fluttered around the Palace of Sports. A huge portrait of Lenin was hung above the main entrance, accompanied by countless flags.

Inside the Palace of Sports were hung the dazzling Soviet national emblem and the emblems of the fifteen union republics. In the center of the venue were the flags of the fifteen union republics. On the rostrum hung a huge banner composed of torches: "Long Live the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!"

A total of more than 15,000 people attended today's celebration.

Before the meeting began, Soviet Party and government leaders, together with heads of foreign delegations and members of the Chinese delegation Soong Ching Ling and Deng Xiaoping, walked onto the rostrum. The whole audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically for a long time.

The meeting was opened by Lobanov, Chairman of the Council of the Union. Lobanov said that forty years ago, under the leadership of Lenin, workers, soldiers, peasants, and all working people launched a revolution to overthrow the monarch and the capitalists. This is the greatest cause in human history. He announced that the agenda of the meeting had only one item, which was to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. He suggested that the celebration meeting be held jointly by the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities.

Then, the whole audience unanimously adopted the agenda of the meeting and the proposal to hold the meeting jointly by the two houses.

Subsequently, the chairman of the meeting announced that Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, would deliver a report. At this time, the audience burst into prolonged and enthusiastic applause. The title of Khrushchev's report was: The 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The full text is about 50,000 words.

In his report, Comrade Khrushchev welcomed the Chinese delegation headed by Comrade Mao Zedong to attend this meeting, and the whole audience stood up and applauded warmly. Then, he welcomed the delegations of Communist and Workers' Parties from various countries, and the whole audience applauded warmly one by one for a long time. At this time, the atmosphere in the audience was very high.

Comrade Khrushchev also warmly welcomed other foreign delegations and foreign guests.

In his report, Comrade Khrushchev said that on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the peoples of all nationalities of the Soviet Union have shown to all mankind the historical victory of socialism. When reviewing this historically significant day of the October Revolution, and when reviewing the glorious path traversed by the socialist motherland, our Party, the Soviet people, and all progressive humanity mention with the deepest love and respect a brilliant name – the name of Lenin, whose immortal genius, the will of a persevering revolutionary fighter, has been and still is inspiring millions of working people to fight for the victory of communism.

When talking about the path the Soviet Union has traversed in the past forty years, Comrade Khrushchev said: Under conditions of capitalist encirclement, and in constant struggle against the conspiracies of international imperialism, the Soviet working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have crushed the frantic resistance of class enemies, and built socialism in a short historical period. They have shown the world the great creative power of the people who have freed themselves from the shackles of capitalism.

Due to the victory of the Second World War, the people of some countries in Europe and Asia have embarked on the road of socialist construction, and socialism has now become a powerful world system.

Comrade Khrushchev said that on this significant day, the Soviet people express heartfelt gratitude and respect to the working classes and working people of all countries who have consistently given fraternal support to the Soviet working people in the struggle for socialism and peace.

When talking about the economic achievements the Soviet Union has achieved in the years of Soviet power, Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that compared with 1913, the total industrial output value of the Soviet Union in 1957 increased thirty-three times. Such a strong development in industry has actually been achieved in twenty to twenty-two years. The United States, Germany, and Britain took eighty to one hundred and fifty years to increase industrial output by about thirty times.

In agriculture, the victory of the collective farm system has turned the Soviet Union into a country with the largest-scale agricultural production in the world. The situation of animal husbandry has also changed. The results of developing animal husbandry this year make us even more convinced that the task of catching up with the United States in the production of meat, milk, and oil per capita in recent years, which has been endorsed by all the people of the Soviet Union, will definitely be accomplished.

In terms of culture and life, the clothing, food, and housing of the Soviet working people have been greatly improved. The realization of the Soviet cultural revolution is a great achievement of socialism, which has made the Soviet Union among the world leaders in the development of science and technology. The manufacture and successful launch of the world's first artificial earth satellite on October 4 this year is the peak of scientific and technological achievements. Now, two stars of peace are orbiting the earth.

Comrade Khrushchev then emphasized that the 20th Congress of the CPSU was an important and historically significant stage in the development of the Soviet Union along the road of communism. He said that at this congress, the Party took the initiative to criticize Stalin's mistakes. However, we cannot agree with those who attempt to use the criticism of the cult of personality to attack the socialist system and the Communist Party.

Comrade Khrushchev said: "While criticizing the incorrect aspects of Stalin's activities, the Party, on the one hand, has fought and will fight in the future against all those who slander Stalin, and who, under the guise of criticizing the cult of personality, incorrectly describe and distort the activities of our Party during the entire historical period when Stalin led the Central Committee. As a loyal Marxist-Leninist and a staunch revolutionary, Stalin will occupy his rightful place in history. Our Party and the Soviet people will remember Stalin and give him his due evaluation."

Comrade Khrushchev said that some "critics" have tried every means to slander our Party's struggle during this period, and to slander the broad road opened up by the Soviet people in the struggle for socialism... These "critics" are either notorious slanderers or people who attempt to cover up their departure from the principles of Marxism-Leninism by clamoring about "Stalinism" and rolling onto the decadent revisionist position. The Party has been and will continue to resolutely fight against all acts that deviate from Marxism-Leninism, against any attempt to distort the essence of Marxism-Leninism, against all those who want to weaken our will in the struggle for socialism and communism, undermine our unity, and ruin our unanimity.

Comrade Khrushchev then talked about the prospects and tasks of Soviet communist construction. He said that the Soviet state is now at a new stage of historical development. The Soviet Union already has good conditions and all the material and spiritual prerequisites for transitioning to a higher stage of communist construction. We have every reason to say that communism is no longer a distant future, and its magnificent and glorious edifice is becoming clearer and clearer in the eyes of the people.

Comrade Khrushchev mentioned the recently adopted resolution on formulating the Soviet Union's 1959-1965 long-term plan for national economic development. He listed the figures of the Soviet Union's current production level and compared them with the corresponding figures in the United States. He said that among the most important industrial products, the Soviet Union is still lagging behind the United States to a considerable extent in the production level of certain items. However, now for the Soviet Union, the production level of the United States is no longer as unattainable as it seemed to some people twenty-five or thirty years ago. Now, the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in the production of certain products, such as wheat, timber, and sugar. The distance has been greatly shortened in terms of the level of mining iron ore and coal, and in the production of pig iron and steel, certain machines and instruments, and cotton and woolen fabrics.

Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that it is estimated that in terms of the output of various most important products, the Soviet state can not only catch up with, but also surpass the current total output of various most important products of the United States in the next fifteen years. Naturally, the economy of the United States may also develop during this period. However, as long as we consider the fact that the speed of industrial development in the Soviet Union is much faster than that in the United States, then we can believe that the task of surpassing the United States in the peaceful competition in the shortest historical period is entirely achievable.

Comrade Khrushchev emphasized that at the current stage of development in the Soviet Union, the necessary conditions are already in place to increase the material welfare of the working people at a faster rate. He said, we believe that this task will also be successfully solved.

Comrade Khrushchev also pointed out that now, in terms of heavy industry and machinery manufacturing, and in the development of science and technology, such a level has been reached that the Soviet Union is able to develop light industry more rapidly without affecting the strengthening of national defense, or the further development of heavy industry and machinery manufacturing.

Comrade Khrushchev said that as the Soviet society continues to advance along the road of communism, the functions of the Soviet socialist state will continue to be perfected and changed in the future. He said that now, the most important functions of the socialist state of the working people are: organizing social production and leading the economy, various undertakings, and culture, and controlling the amount of labor and consumption for the benefit of the working people; conducting comprehensive education for the working people, including education in new labor discipline and a communist attitude towards labor; in terms of foreign policy, unswervingly implementing Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence and consolidating peace between countries with different socio-political systems; and strengthening the unbreakable friendship, fraternal cooperation, and mutual assistance between countries in the world socialist system.

Comrade Khrushchev said that, of course, we cannot forget the important function of the socialist state of defending the country from the danger of foreign aggression. He said, "Maintaining political vigilance against the conspiracies of the enemies of socialism and against their attempts to launch a new war, and striving to strengthen the country's defense capabilities, is and will always be a matter of special concern to the Soviet state, whether now or in the future." Khrushchev said that, as emphasized in the resolution of the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the main source of the strength and power of the Soviet Army and Navy lies in the fact that the Communist Party is their organizer, leader, and teacher.

Comrade Khrushchev then talked about the international significance of the October Revolution and the growth of world socialist forces. He said that the past forty years have been characterized by the victorious advance of democratic and socialist forces, and the liberation of many countries and nations from the shackles of colonialism and imperialism. These forty years have been a period of broader and deeper flourishing of the world communist movement and the workers' movement. Many powerful Marxist-Leninist parties have risen, grown, and been tempered in revolutionary struggles, and they today unite more than thirty-three million communist party members in their ranks. The most important historical event after the October Revolution was the victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

Comrade Khrushchev emphasized that the rise of the world socialist system is the greatest achievement of the international communist movement and the victory of Marxism-Leninism.

Comrade Khrushchev said that the entire development process puts the struggle to strengthen unity and develop forms of cooperation among all workers' class revolutionary parties on the basis of Marxism-Leninism at the forefront. He exposed the ideological sabotage activities carried out by imperialists in the struggle against the socialist camp under the banner of so-called "national communism." He said that under the current conditions, various forms of socialist states have emerged. However, without Marxist-Leninist parties, the existence of socialist states is impossible. The theory of scientific socialism takes into account, and cannot but take into account, the historical characteristics of each country, which to some extent determine the forms and methods of socialist construction. However, if we proceed from the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, then what should be put in the first place is not the characteristics of each country, but the main points and common points that constitute the basis for the struggle for socialism. The consistent implementation of the Marxist-Leninist principles of building socialism, such a main point, remains unshakable. He said that attempts to undermine the socialist movement from within, disintegrate socialist countries and parties, and make them conflict with each other, are one of the most subtle forms of struggle used by imperialism and its lackeys against the world socialist system. Khrushchev said that this is one of the main dangers, and we should wage the most resolute struggle against it.

Comrade Khrushchev said that the general crisis of capitalism continues to intensify, and the antagonistic contradictions that are disintegrating the capitalist world are constantly deepening. In the era of the general crisis of capitalism, the unprecedented growth of militarism is an inseparable feature of aggressive imperialist politics and economics. The intensification of the general crisis of capitalism is particularly powerfully manifested in the collapse of the colonial system. Now, American imperialists are concocting a conspiracy against Syria. Khrushchev pointed out that imperialists are trying every means to prolong their rule in Asian and African countries. However, the iron facts of history show that the last days of imperialist rule in the East are coming.

Comrade Khrushchev once again emphasized that the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is the foundation of Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a peace-loving policy, striving to reach mutually acceptable agreements with Western countries on various issues related to disarmament. He said: "We solemnly declare that our people have never thought, and will not in the future, adopt any means of destruction, unless our country is attacked by imperialist countries."

Comrade Khrushchev said that we hope that representatives of capitalist countries and representatives of socialist countries will hold high-level talks in order to reach an agreement on the basis of considering the realities and mutual understanding, on abandoning war as a method of resolving international problems, in order to stop the Cold War and stop the expansion of armaments, and to establish relations between countries on the basis of coexistence, and to resolve ideological disputes not through war but through peaceful competition in developing the economy and culture and better meeting the material and spiritual needs of mankind.

Comrade Khrushchev said at the end of his report: "Our prospects for advancement are clear and magnificent... The Communist Party and the Soviet people are looking to the future, and their attention is focused on the magnificent tasks of communist construction that we face. The Party and the people are solving these tasks with firm conviction and deep confidence in their own creative power and in the victory of the communist prospect."

Comrade Khrushchev's report lasted for three and a half hours, and his report was constantly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience.

At the end of Comrade Khrushchev's report, the atmosphere in the audience was enthusiastic, and a storm of applause erupted.

Then, the whole audience stood up unanimously, applauding and cheering.

When Comrade Khrushchev returned to his seat, Comrade Mao Zedong, who was sitting with him, warmly shook his hand to congratulate him, and at this time, the applause from the audience was incessant.

The morning meeting ended at 2:05 PM.

After a break, the celebration meeting continued at 4:00 PM, with Razis, Chairman of the Council of Nationalities, serving as the chairman of the meeting.

Comrade Mao Zedong, head of the Chinese delegation, spoke at the meeting. When Comrade Mao Zedong walked to the podium, the whole audience stood up and applauded warmly.

Comrade Mao Zedong first extended warm and fraternal congratulations to the great Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the Soviet Communist Party, as well as to all those present. He then elaborated on the world historical significance of the October Revolution, the great achievements of the Soviet people over the past forty years, and the universal importance of the path of the October Revolution and the Soviet experience to the people of all countries. He also talked about the war conspiracies of imperialism and the struggle of socialist countries to strive for peace and oppose war.

After talking about the great achievements of China's various construction undertakings in the past eight years and the rectification movement currently being carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party, Comrade Mao Zedong, on behalf of the Chinese people, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Union for its multi-faceted fraternal assistance to China.

Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized that strengthening the unity of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union is the sacred international obligation of all socialist countries. He concluded by saying: "The fact that representatives of the working class and the broad masses of the people from all over the world are here today to participate in the grand meeting of the Soviet Supreme Soviet celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in itself shows the great unity of the forces of the world's people and symbolizes the prosperity and development of the international socialist movement. Let us continue to work hard to strengthen the unity of socialist countries, strengthen the unity of the working people and oppressed nations of the world, and greet new and greater victories!"

Comrade Mao Zedong's speech was constantly interrupted by long and enthusiastic applause from the audience. After Comrade Mao Zedong's speech, the whole audience once again stood up, and at the same time, warm and lasting applause rang out.

Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev warmly shook hands.

Then, Comrades Gomulka, Novotny, Ulbricht, Stoica, Zhivkov, and Kadar spoke.

After a short break, the meeting continued. (Attached image)

    会议由联盟院主席洛巴诺夫主持开幕。洛巴诺夫说，四十年前，工人、士兵、农民和全体劳动人民在列宁的领导下，发动了推翻君主和资本家的革命。这是人类历史上最伟大的事业。他宣布会议的议程只有一项，这就是庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。他建议，庆祝会议由联盟院和民族院联合举行。

    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中表示欢迎以毛泽东同志为首的中国代表团出席这次会议，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。接着，他又表示欢迎各国共产党和工人党代表团，全场一一热烈鼓掌，经久不息。这时，全场情绪十分高涨。
    赫鲁晓夫同志还热烈欢迎其他外国代表团和外国客人们。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中说，在十月革命四十周年的日子里，苏联各族人民向全人类显示了社会主义的历史性胜利。在回顾十月革命这个有历史意义的日子的时候，在回顾社会主义祖国走过的光荣道路的时候，我们党、苏联人民、全体进步人类都怀着最深厚的敬爱心情提到一个光辉的名字——列宁的名字，他的不朽的天才、坚忍不拔的革命战士的意志，曾经并且仍在鼓舞着千百万的劳动者为共产主义的胜利而斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在谈到苏联四十年来走过的道路的时候说：在资本主义包围的条件下，在同国际帝国主义阴谋进行不断的斗争中，苏联劳动人民在共产党的领导下，摧毁了阶级敌人的疯狂反抗，并且在短短的历史时期内建成了社会主义。他们向全世界显示出摆脱了资本主义桎梏的人民的伟大创造力量。
    由于第二次世界大战的胜利，欧洲和亚洲一些国家的人民走上了社会主义建设的道路，社会主义现在已经成了一个强大的世界体系。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，在这个意义重大的日子里，苏联人民向一贯给予苏联劳动人民在为社会主义、和平事业的斗争中以兄弟般的支持的各国工人阶级和劳动人民表示衷心的感谢和敬意。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在谈到在苏维埃政权年代中苏联所获得的经济成就时指出，同1913年相比，苏联1957年工业总产值增为三十三倍。工业上的如此强大的发展实际上是在二十到二十二年中达到的。而美国、德国和英国用了八十年到一百五十年的时间才使工业产量增加到三十倍左右。
    在农业方面，集体农庄制度的胜利把苏联变成具有世界上最大规模农业生产的国家。畜牧业的状况也发生了变化。今年发展畜牧业的结果令人更加深信苏联全体人民所赞同的、最近几年内按人口平均计算的肉类、牛奶和油类的生产赶上美国这项任务一定能够完成。
    在文化和生活方面，现在，苏联劳动人民的衣、食、住大大地改善了。苏联文化革命的实现是社会主义的伟大成就，它使得苏联在科学技术发展方面已经名列世界前茅。制成并在今年10月4日成功地发射出世界第一个人造地球卫星，是科学技术成就的高峰。现在，两颗和平的明星，正在围绕地球飞行。
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着强调指出，苏共第二十次代表大会在苏联沿着共产主义道路的发展中是一个重要的具有历史意义的阶段。他说，在这次大会上，党主动倡议对斯大林的错误展开了批评。但是，我们不能同意那些企图利用对个人崇拜的批评来攻击社会主义制度和共产党的人。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说：“党一方面批评斯大林活动的不正确方面，另一方面过去和将来都同所有这样的人作斗争，他们诽谤斯大林，在批评个人崇拜的幌子下不正确地描述和歪曲在斯大林领导中央委员会时我们党整个历史时期的活动。作为一个忠实的马克思列宁主义者和坚强的革命家，斯大林在历史上将占有应有的地位。我们党和苏联人民将怀念斯大林，并给予他应有的评价。”
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，某些“批评家”千方百计地竭力诬蔑我们党这一段时期的斗争，诬蔑苏联人民在争取社会主义的斗争中所开辟的康庄大道……这种“批评家”要么就是恶名昭著的诽谤者，要么就是企图以关于“斯大林主义”的叫嚷来掩饰他们脱离马克思列宁主义原则的行径而滚到腐朽的修正主义立场上去的人们。党曾经而且今后仍将坚决地同一切离开马克思列宁主义的行为、同任何歪曲马克思列宁主义实质的企图、同一切想削弱我们在争取社会主义和共产主义的斗争中的意志、破坏我们的团结、搞垮我们的一致的人进行斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着谈到了苏联共产主义建设的前景和任务。他说，苏维埃国家现在正处在历史发展的新阶段。苏联已经有了往共产主义建设的更高阶段过渡的良好的条件、一切物质和精神前提。我们有充分根据说，共产主义已经不是遥远的未来，它的宏伟辉煌的大厦越来越清楚地出现在人民的眼前了。
    赫鲁晓夫同志提到了不久以前通过的关于制定苏联1959—1965年国民经济发展远景计划的决议。他列举了苏联目前生产水平的数字，来和美国相应的数字比较。他说，在最重要的工业产品中，苏联还在某几项的生产水平上相当大地落在美国的后面。但是，现在对苏联来说，美国的生产水平已经不再像二十五年、三十年前某些人看来那样高不可及了。现在，苏联在某些产品方面，例如小麦、采伐木料和糖的产量方面都超过美国的生产水平。在铁矿和煤的开采水平方面，在生铁和钢、某些机器和仪器、棉织品和毛织品的生产方面，距离已经大大缩小了。
    赫鲁晓夫同志指出，据估计，在各种最重要的产品产量上，苏维埃国家在最近的十五年内不仅可以赶上、而且可以超过美国目前的各种最重要的产品的总产量。自然，在这个时期内，美国的经济也可能有所发展。但是，只要考虑到苏联工业发展速度比美国快得多这一点，那末就可以认为，在最短的历史时期内在和平竞赛中超过美国这一任务是完全可以实现的。
    赫鲁晓夫同志强调指出，在苏联发展的现阶段，用更快的速度提高劳动人民的物质福利的必要条件已经具备。他说，我们相信，这个任务也将顺利解决。
    赫鲁晓夫同志还指出，现在，在重工业和机器制造业方面，在科学技术的发展方面已经达到这样的程度：苏联有可能在不影响国防的加强，不影响重工业和机器制造业的进一步发展的情况下，更加迅速地发展轻工业。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，随着苏维埃社会的继续沿共产主义道路前进，苏维埃社会主义国家的职能今后仍将日臻完善和改变。他说，现在，劳动人民社会主义国家的最主要的职能是：组织社会生产和领导经济、各种事业和文化，为劳动人民的利益而控制劳动量和消费量；对劳动人民进行全面的教育，其中包括进行新的劳动纪律教育和共产主义的劳动态度教育；在外交政策方面，始终不渝地执行列宁关于社会政治制度不同的国家和平共处和巩固和平的方针；加强世界社会主义体系各国之间的牢不可破的友谊、兄弟合作和互相帮助。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，当然，我们不能忘记保卫国家不受外来侵犯的危险这样的社会主义国家的重要的职能。他说，“对社会主义敌人的阴谋和对他们发动新战争的企图保持政治警惕性，尽力加强国家的国防力量，这无论在现在或者将来都是苏维埃国家所特别关心的对象”。赫鲁晓夫说，正如不久前举行的苏共中央全会的决议中所强调的那样，苏联陆海军的强大和威力的主要源泉在于：它们的组织者、领导者和教导者是共产党。
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着谈到了十月革命的国际意义和世界社会主义力量的壮大。他说，过去四十年的特点是民主和社会主义力量胜利进军，许多国家和民族从殖民主义和帝国主义的枷锁下解放出来。这四十年是世界共产主义运动和工人运动更广地更深地蓬勃发展的时期。许多强大的马克思列宁主义政党在革命斗争中兴起了、成长了，并且得到了锻炼，它们今天在自己的队伍中团结着三千三百万以上的共产党员。十月革命以后最重大的历史事件是中国革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立。
    赫鲁晓夫同志强调指出，世界社会主义体系的兴起是国际共产主义运动的最伟大成果，是马克思列宁主义的胜利。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，整个发展过程在各个工人阶级革命政党面前把争取在马克思列宁主义基础上加强团结和发展合作形式的斗争提到首要地位。他揭露了帝国主义者在反对社会主义阵营的斗争中所采取的、以所谓“民族共产主义”为旗帜的思想破坏活动。他说，在当今的条件下，产生了各种形式的社会主义国家。然而，没有马克思列宁主义的政党，社会主义国家的存在是不可能的。科学的社会主义的理论考虑到、而且也不能不考虑到各国的历史特点，这种特点在某种程度上确定了社会主义建设的形式和方法。但是，如果从马克思列宁主义立场出发，那么应提到首位的就不是各国所具有的某种特点，而是构成为社会主义而斗争的基础的主要之点、共同之点。贯彻执行建设社会主义的马克思列宁主义原则这样一个主要点，仍然是不可动摇的。他说，企图从内部破坏社会主义运动、瓦解社会主义国家和政党并使它们互相冲突的做法，是帝国主义及其走狗反对世界社会主义体系的最巧妙的斗争形式之一。赫鲁晓夫说，这是主要的危险之一，我们应该同它进行最坚决的斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，资本主义的总危机在继续尖锐化，使资本主义世界分崩离析的对抗性矛盾正在不断加深。在资本主义总危机的时代，军国主义的空前增长是侵略性的帝国主义政治和经济不可分的特征。资本主义总危机的尖锐化特别有力地表现在殖民主义制度的崩溃上。现在，美帝国主义者正在制造反叙利亚的阴谋。赫鲁晓夫指出，帝国主义者千方百计企图延长他们在亚非国家的统治。但是，铁的历史事实说明，帝国主义在东方的统治的末日正在到来。
    赫鲁晓夫同志再次着重指出，不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则是苏联外交政策的基础。苏联始终不渝地奉行着爱好和平的政策，力求同西方国家就有关裁军方面的各个问题达成彼此都能接受的协议。他说：“我们郑重地宣布，我国人民从来不曾想，将来也不打算采用任何毁灭的手段，如果我们的国家不遭到帝国主义国家方面的进攻的话。”
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，我们希望资本主义国家的代表和社会主义国家的代表举行高级会谈，以便在考虑现实情况和互相谅解的基础上，在以摒弃战争作为解决国际问题的方法上达成协议，以便停止冷战和停止扩充军备，在共处基础上建立国与国之间的关系，不是通过战争而是通过在发展经济和文化、更好地满足人类物质和精神需求方面的和平竞赛来解决意识形态方面的争端。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告的最后说：“我们前进的远景是明确的、宏伟的……共产党和苏联人民瞻望着未来，他们的注意力集中在我们所面临的共产主义建设的宏伟任务上。党和人民怀着坚定的信念和对自己的创造力量、对共产主义远景的胜利的深刻信心解决着这些任务。”
    赫鲁晓夫同志的报告历时三小时半，他的报告不断地为全场的热烈掌声所打断。
    在赫鲁晓夫同志报告结束的时候，全场热情高涨，迸发出暴风雨般的掌声。
    接着，全场一致起立，发出鼓掌和欢呼。
    当赫鲁晓夫同志回到座位时，原来和他坐在一起的毛泽东同志同他热烈握手，表示祝贺，这时全场掌声不绝。
    上午会议进行到下午两点零五分结束。
    在休息后，庆祝大会在下午四时继续举行，由民族院主席拉齐斯担任会议主席。
    中国代表团团长毛泽东同志在会上讲了话。当毛泽东同志走向讲台时，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。
    毛泽东同志首先向伟大的苏联人民、苏联政府和苏联共产党以及全体到会者表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。他接着阐述了十月革命的世界历史意义，苏联人民四十年来取得的伟大成就，以及十月革命的道路和苏联经验对各国人民的普遍重要意义。他还谈到了帝国主义的战争阴谋和社会主义各国争取和平反对战争的斗争。
    毛泽东同志在谈到八年来中国各种建设事业的巨大成就和目前中国人民在共产党领导下进行的整风运动之后，代表中国人民对苏联给予中国多方面的兄弟般的援助表示衷心的谢意。
    毛泽东同志强调说，增强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结是一切社会主义国家的神圣的国际义务。他最后说：“从世界各国来的工人阶级和广大人民的代表今天在这里参加苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命四十周年的盛会，这个事实本身就说明了世界人民力量的伟大团结，就象征了国际社会主义运动的兴旺发达。让我们继续努力增强社会主义各国的团结，增强全世界劳动人民和被压迫民族的团结，去迎接新的更伟大的胜利！”
    毛泽东同志的讲话不断被全场长时间的热烈掌声所打断。毛泽东同志讲话后，全场再一次起立，同时响起了热烈的经久不息的掌声。
    毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志热烈握手。
    接着讲话的有哥穆尔卡同志、诺沃提尼同志、乌布利希同志、斯托伊卡同志、日夫科夫同志、卡德尔同志。
    经过短时间休息后，会议继续进行。（附图片）
