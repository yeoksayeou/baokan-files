Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th: Currently, the Soviet Union's automobile manufacturing industry is able to produce an average of one car every minute. Even before the war, the number of Soviet trucks had caught up with those in Western European countries, ranking second in the world. Last year, the volume of freight transported by Soviet trucks increased by four and a half times compared to the pre-war period.

Soviet automobile factories are equipped with the most modern technology. Last year, the number of automated production lines in these factories reached seventy-six, which means they have tripled in the past six years. Due to the continuous improvement of automobile production technology, the Soviet Union produced 465,000 vehicles last year, including 358,000 trucks, 98,000 cars, and 9,000 buses.

The Soviet Union is constantly introducing new models of cars every year. More than thirty kinds of cars were exhibited at the Soviet industrial exhibition this year. Among them were the new "Volga" sedan, various styles of "Moskvich" cars, the "TA3-47" tracked vehicle capable of traversing swamps and snow, and the "MA3-530" truck with a load capacity of 40 tons.

    苏联生产汽车  每一分钟一辆
    新华社莫斯科12日电　目前，苏联的汽车制造业平均每分钟就能够生产一辆汽车。还在战前年代里，苏联载重汽车的数量就赶上了西欧各国而居世界第二位。去年苏联载重汽车的货运量比战前增加了四倍半。
    苏联汽车制造厂是用最现代化的技术装备起来的。去年这些工厂的自动化作业线的数量达七十六条，这就是说在过去六年中就增加了三倍。由于汽车生产技术的不断改进，去年苏联就生产了四十六万五千辆汽车，其中载重汽车有三十五万八千辆，小汽车九万八千辆，公共汽车九千辆。
    苏联每年不断出现新的型号的汽车。在今年苏联的工业展览会上就展出了三十多种汽车。其中有新型的“伏尔加”牌小卧车，各种样式的“莫斯科人”小汽车，能够穿越沼泽、积雪等障碍的“TA3—47”型履带汽车，载重达四十吨的“MA3—530”型载重汽车等。
