    Greening the Mountains, Building Water Conservancy
    —Jiyuan County Continues to Advance Under the Encouragement of the National Agricultural Development Program
    This place used to be a dry ditch, but now clear water flows continuously, and large flocks of sheep are drinking here.
    The terraced fields with ditches, built in Shangzhuang Township, have a history of over 900 years. However, due to disrepair over the years, before liberation, the yield of most fields was only over 60 jin per mu. After cooperativization, the vast number of farmers organized themselves to vigorously repair the terraced fields with ditches and planted rice in the ditches. Last year, the township generally achieved a bumper harvest, and many agricultural producers' cooperatives experienced the miracle of a thousand jin of grain per mu.
    Look, the fish fry raised last August now weigh more than seven jin.
    The farmers of Shangzhuang Township have begun to expand the Guanghui River and build water conservancy projects in the Guanghui Canal irrigation area.
    Male and female members of the Huling Agricultural Producers' Cooperative are digging fish-scale pits on barren mountains and cultivating oak trees. This is a good way to conserve water and soil.
    Sanhe Reservoir is the largest reservoir in Jiyuan County, covering an area of ​​more than 3,000 mu and raising 100,000 fish. This is the scene of fishing.
    This place was a barren mountain before liberation. After several years of closing off the mountains for afforestation, it has now become a lush forest mountain. After the barren mountains were greened, they played a significant role in water and soil conservation, reducing various natural disasters, and regulating the climate.

    绿化山区  兴修水利
    ——济源县在全国农业发展纲要的鼓舞下继续迈进
    这里过去是干沟，现在清水长流，大批羊群正在这里饮水。
    尚庄乡兴修的沟洫台田，已有九百多年的历史。但是年久失修，到解放以前，多数田地亩产量只达六十多斤。合作化后，广大农民组织起来，大力整修沟洫台田并在沟洫里种了水稻。去年该乡普遍获得丰收，许多农业生产合作社出现亩产千斤粮的奇迹。
    你看，去年八月份养的鱼苗到现在已有七斤多重。
    尚庄乡的农民，又开始了扩建广惠河和兴修广惠渠灌溉区的水利工程。
    虎岭农业生产合作社的男女社员正在荒山上挖鱼鳞坑和培育橡树。这是水土保持的好办法。
    三合水库是济源县最大的一个水库，面积达三千多亩，养鱼十万条。这是正在捕鱼的情形。
    这儿在解放前是一片荒山，经过几年的封山育林，现在已变成茂盛的森林山。荒山绿化后，在水土保持、减少各种自然灾害和调节气候等方面，起了很大的作用。
