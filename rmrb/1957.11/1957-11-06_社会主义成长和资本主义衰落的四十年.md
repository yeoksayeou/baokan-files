Forty Years of Socialist Growth and Capitalist Decline
Soviet Union　Ye. Varga
The Second World War weakened all imperialist countries except the United States. Imperialists can no longer rely on strong armies and warships to force the people in their colonies to submit.

Colonial peoples have been waging anti-colonialist struggles in the past and present, using various methods based on the specific historical conditions of their countries: mass refusal to obey the colonial system in India; open warfare with revolutionary armies in China and Vietnam; guerrilla warfare in Tunisia and Algeria; and resistance to the colonizers by all residents in Cyprus.

The apologists for imperialism, especially the British ones, spread a myth that Britain "voluntarily" gave up its rule in India, Burma, Ceylon, Ghana, Malaya, and other regions. This is nonsense. No imperialist country would voluntarily give up its colonies. Every imperialist country tries its best to maintain its dominant position by force whenever it has the opportunity. Indochina, Indonesia, Kenya, Cyprus, and Algeria are solid evidence. They only give up their political and military dominance when the situation forces the colonialists to do so. They give up in order to save their investments and retain the possibility of continuing economic exploitation of the former colonies.

Imperialists plan to partially retain their political and economic position in these countries by granting sovereignty and establishing close economic ties with the ruling classes of underdeveloped countries. Such plans are untenable, mainly for the following reasons:

(1) While some groups of the ruling classes of the former colonies still tend to cooperate with the imperialists, the working masses and a portion of the patriotic bourgeoisie advocate complete economic independence from the colonialists;

(2) Imperialists intend to preserve their economic dominance in economically backward countries by relying on the old tricks they have always used, namely, the monopoly of supplying means of production to former colonies, the monopoly of capital exports, and the monopoly of arms production and supply. They have overlooked the fundamental changes that have taken place in the Soviet economy, especially in the last decade.

The Soviet industry is able to supply all the necessary means of production to underdeveloped countries. The Soviet financial strength makes it possible to provide loans to former colonies on more favorable terms than the United States, and without imposing any political obligations as the United States does. The Soviet Union can and is prepared to provide weapons for defense needs to countries that are not linked to imperialist military blocs. The imperialists' monopoly no longer exists.

The friendly assistance and support of the Soviet Union to underdeveloped countries can ensure that the people who have been freed from oppression will be strengthened in their future struggles against the colonialists. The imperialists' positions in the former colonies will be lost one by one. The people of the existing colonies will wage an increasingly resolute struggle for their liberation. The colonial system will inevitably be completely eradicated in the near future.

The general situation is as follows:

Forty years ago, the Soviet Republic was the only country embarking on the path of socialist revolution; its productive forces were underdeveloped, its people lived in poverty, and its cultural level was low.

Forty years later, the Soviet Union exists in a system of socialist countries; its relations with many countries that have freed themselves from imperialist oppression and all other peace-loving countries are based on friendship and trust. Our country extends boundless sympathy to the working people of the colonies, to the class-conscious proletariat and progressive intellectuals in capitalist countries, and to all who sincerely support peace throughout the world.

The Soviet Union has transformed itself from a country with a low level of productive forces to a country with a high level of technology. In this regard, the Soviet Union is second only to the United States, but can catch up with the United States in a short historical period. The Soviet Union has transformed itself from a country with a large number of illiterates into a country with an advanced, universal culture. In the Soviet Union, the ranks of industrial workers are replenished by young people with secondary education; Soviet scholars have made outstanding achievements of world significance.

In the forty years of competition with capitalism, socialism has been the absolute winner in economic, political, and cultural terms.

During this period, despite some growth in production, the crisis of capitalism has become significantly more acute. The decline of capitalism is obvious, and its final demise is only a matter of time. Capitalism has lost its rule over more than 900 million people, that is, over one-third of the world's population. Many countries that have freed themselves from colonial oppression regard socialist countries as their natural allies in the struggle against imperialism. In capitalist countries, fewer and fewer people believe in the immutability of the bourgeois system and the superiority of the capitalist system over the socialist system.

The historical process of the decline and demise of capitalism is in a very intense state, and like the transition of any social system, this process is taking place unevenly, in stages, and in fierce struggles. But this process is progressing inexorably according to the laws of economic development. The final demise of capitalism is a matter of time. From a historical point of view, this is a matter of the near future.

Note: ①A private conversation I had with Renner, the then Prime Minister of Austria, after 1919, can represent the attitude of the Social Democratic leaders. At that time, he said to me: "You know, when I was young, I also envisioned seizing power in the same way as the Russians; if I were Russian, I might also be a Bolshevik, but it is impossible to adopt the Russian method in our small Austria." By the way, Renner, when he was quite young a few years before the First World War, published a popular book under the pseudonym Springer, in which he tried to prove the vitality and effectiveness of the Habsburg monarchy.

②Forty years have passed since then. These are forty years of struggle, forty years of socialist victory, growth, and expansion. But even today, the bourgeoisie still claims that socialism is only temporary. Many so-called "scientific" papers published in important American magazines "Fortune" and "U.S. News & World Report" in 1957 claim that socialism is in crisis and about to collapse! Such statements are not in accordance with historical facts and are simply extremely stupid. But what else can these magazines tell their readers?

③The long-term armed struggle against the most stubborn forces of domestic counter-revolution also has its positive side. The counter-revolutionary forces were completely destroyed. But there is also another situation, such as what happened in modern Hungary: some die-hard elements of the overthrown ruling class remain in the country, trying every means to disguise themselves, and only twelve years later, with the help of imperialists, they organized a counter-revolutionary riot.

    社会主义成长和资本主义衰落的四十年
    苏联　叶·瓦尔加
    第二次世界大战削弱了除美国以外的所有帝国主义国家。帝国主义者已不能再靠坚兵利舰来使它们殖民领地上的人民俯首听命了。
    殖民地人民在过去和现在都是依据本国的具体历史条件，用各种不同的方法，进行着反殖民主义的斗争：在印度是群众性的拒绝服从殖民制度；在中国和越南是用革命军队进行公开的战争；在突尼斯和阿尔及利亚是开展游击战争；在塞浦路斯，是全体居民反抗殖民者。
    帝国主义的辩护人，特别是英国的辩护人，散布这样一种神话，说什么英国“自愿”放弃了它在印度、缅甸、锡兰、加纳、马来亚及其它地区的统治权。这是胡说。没有一个帝国主义国家会自愿放弃它的殖民地。一切帝国主义国家一有机会就竭力凭靠武力来保持自己的统治地位。印度支那、印度尼西亚、怯尼亚、塞浦路斯、阿尔及利亚，就是确凿的证据。只有在局势迫使殖民主义者不得不这样做的时候，他们才会放弃自己在政治上和军事上的统治权。他们之所以放弃，是为了挽救自己的投资和保留对从前的殖民地在经济上继续进行剥削的可能性。
    帝国主义者计划用赋予主权及同不发达国家的统治阶级建立密切的经济联系的方法，来部分地保留自己在这些国家的政治、经济地位。这样的计划是站不住脚的，其主要原因如下：
    （1）如果说前殖民地的统治阶级的某些集团仍然倾向于同帝国主义者合作，而劳动群众和一部分有爱国主义情绪的资产阶级，则主张在经济上完全摆脱殖民主义者；
    （2）帝国主义者打算借助于历来使用过的老手法，即依靠对前殖民地供应生产资料方面的垄断、资本输出的垄断、军火生产和供应的垄断，来保全自己在经济落后国家内的经济统治地位。他们忽略了苏联经济中已发生过的那些根本变化，特别是近十年来的变化。
    苏联的工业能够对不发达的国家供应一切必要的生产资料。苏联的财政实力，有可能对前殖民地贷款，其条件比美国提的条件优惠，决不同于美国那样给贷款强加上任何政治义务。苏联可能而且准备对那些同帝国主义军事集团没有联系的国家提供用于国防需要的武器。帝国主义者的垄断不再存在了。
    苏联对不发达国家的友好帮助与支援，可以保障已摆脱压迫的人民，在今后反对殖民主义者的斗争中，力量一定会加强。帝国主义者在前殖民地的阵地将会逐个地丧失掉。现存殖民地的人民，将为自己的解放进行越来越坚决的斗争。在最近的将来必然完全铲除殖民地制度。
    总的情况如下：
    四十年前，苏维埃共和国是走上社会主义革命道路的唯一的国家；它的生产力不发达，人民生活贫困，文化水平低。
    四十年后的今天，苏联生存于社会主义国家体系中；它同摆脱了帝国主义压迫的许多国家以及其他一切爱好和平的国家的关系建立在友好和信任的基础之上。我国对殖民地的劳动人民，对资本主义国家有阶级觉悟的无产阶级和进步知识分子，以及全世界真诚拥护和平的人，寄予无限的同情。
    苏联从一个生产力发展水平低的国家变成了有高度技术水平的国家。在这方面，苏联仅次于美国，但在短短的历史时期内就可以赶上美国。苏联从一个有大量文盲的国家变成了有先进的、全民文化的国家。在苏联，以受过中等教育的年青人来补充产业工人队伍；苏联的学者们取得了具有世界意义的卓越成就。
    在同资本主义竞赛的四十年当中，社会主义在经济、政治和文化上是绝对优胜者。
    在这个时期内，尽管生产有某些增长，但资本主义的危机却显著地尖锐化了。资本主义的衰落是显而易见的，它的最后灭亡只是时间问题。资本主义丧失了对九亿以上人口的统治权，也即丧失了对地球上三分之一人口的统治权。许多已经摆脱了殖民主义压迫的国家，把社会主义国家当做自己反对帝国主义斗争中的天然同盟军。在资本主义国家里，相信资产阶级制度不可动摇、相信资本主义制度优于社会主义制度的人，已经越来越少了。
    资本主义在历史上衰落和灭亡的过程，已处在十分激烈的状态，正如任何社会制度的过渡一样，这个过程正在不平衡地、分阶段地并且在残酷的搏斗中发生着。但这个过程是按照经济发展规律一往直前地进展着。资本主义的最后灭亡是时间问题。从历史的观点来看，这是一个不久的将来的问题。
    注：　　①1919年后当时奥地利的首相伦涅尔跟我的一席私人谈话，可代表社会民主党首领们的态度。当时他对我说：“您可知道，我在年青的时候，也曾设想过用同俄国人那样的方式来夺取政权；如果我是俄国人，那么也可能是一个布尔什维克，但是，在我们这个小小的奥地利采用俄国人的方法是办不到的。”顺便提一下，伦涅尔在第一次世界大战前几年相当年轻的时候，就曾用施普林格尔的笔名出过一本风行一时的书。在这本书里，他试图证明哈卜斯堡君主政体存在的生命力和效益。
    ②从那时起，已过了四十年。这是斗争的四十年，是社会主义胜利、成长和扩展的四十年。但是，直到今天，资产阶级还在声言社会主义只带有暂时的性质。1957年美国重要杂志“幸福”、
  “美国新闻与世界报道”所刊载的许多所谓“科学性”论文中，都声称社会主义危机和即将崩溃！这一类说法是不符合历史事实的，简直是愚蠢已极。但是，除此而外，这些杂志又能告诉读者什么呢？
    ③对国内反革命派最凶顽的势力进行长期的武装斗争，也有其积极的一面。反革命势力被彻底摧毁了。但也有另一种情况，例如在现代匈牙利所发生的：已被推翻的统治阶级的一些顽抗分子仍然留在国内，千方百计地伪装起来，仅仅过了十二年，他们就在帝国主义者的帮助下组织了一次反革命暴乱。（续完）
