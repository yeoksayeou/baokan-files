Xinhua News Agency Report: Amman Dispatch: The Jordanian cabinet held a special meeting on the 12th to study the increasingly severe domestic situation.

According to reports from the Lebanese newspapers "Al Shark" and "Al Siyassa," due to continuous demonstrations by people in various parts of Jordan, the Jordanian authorities have severed traffic between the eastern and western regions of the country and have urgently mobilized Bedouin armed forces to suppress the demonstrating people.

"Al Shark" said that fearing the people's anger, most members of the Jordanian royal family have left Jordan. King Hussein is living deep within the palace, Foreign Minister Rifai travels in an armored car when going out, and the other ministers dare not step out of their homes.

"Al Shark" emphasized that the United States is extremely uneasy about the situation in Jordan. The U.S. Embassy in Jordan has spent a large sum of money to buy off Jordanian traitors, attempting to use them to suppress the people's resistance.

Jordanian parliament member Khalifa telegraphed the leaders of various Arab countries and parliamentary leaders on the 12th, requesting them to stop the Egyptian media from criticizing the Jordanian ruling group's betrayal of national interests.

Cairo Dispatch: The Egyptian "Al-Gomhouria" published an editorial on the 12th, saying that Jordanian King Hussein "is seeking the protection of the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine" because "after betraying the Arab cause, he fears the Jordanian and Arab people."

The newspaper said that this is "not surprising." "After engaging in the Zarqa conspiracy (to strike at patriotic forces in the army) and dissolving Nabulsi's nationalist government, Hussein is willing to be dominated by the likes of Dulles, Golda Meir, and Ben-Gurion."

"Al-Gomhouria" warned Hussein: "Using force against the Jordanian people will not free himself from the inevitable doom of destruction."

"Al-Shaab" said on the same day that in the face of the current nationalist movement in Jordan, the United States may carry out armed intervention based on the Eisenhower Doctrine and the Baghdad Pact to maintain the agreement between Israel and the King of Jordan.

    约旦人民怒吼　统治者发抖
    王亲国戚或躲或逃　美国官员网罗约奸
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：安曼消息：约旦内阁12日举行特别会议，研究国内日益加剧的局势。
    据黎巴嫩“东方报”和“政治报”报道，由于约旦各地人民不断举行示威游行，约旦当局断绝了国内东西两地区之间的交通，并且紧急调动贝都印族的武装部队来镇压游行示威的人民。
    “东方报”说，由于害怕人民的愤怒，约旦王室的大多数成员都离开了约旦，国王侯赛因深居宫中，外交大臣里法伊外出时要乘装甲车，其余的大臣们不敢跨出自己家门一步。
    “东方报”强调指出，美国对约旦局势感到极度不安。美国驻约旦大使馆花费了大笔金钱来收买约旦的卖国贼，企图利用他来镇压人民的反抗。
    约旦议会议员哈利法12日致电各阿拉伯国家领导人和议会领袖，要求制止埃及舆论对约旦统治集团叛卖民族利益行为的指责。
    开罗消息：埃及“共和国报”12日发表社论说，约旦国王侯赛因“正在争取巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义的保护”，因为“他在背叛了阿拉伯人的事业以后，害怕约旦人民和阿拉伯人民”。
    这家报纸说，这“并没有什么奇怪”。“侯赛因在搞扎尔卡阴谋（打击军队中的爱国力量）和解散纳布西的民族主义政府以后，甘心受杜勒斯、果尔达·梅厄和本—古里安之流的支配。”
    “共和国报”向侯赛因提出警告说：“对约旦人民使用武力是无法使自己摆脱不可避免的注定要毁灭的命运的。”
    “人民报”同一天说，在面临约旦当前的民族主义运动的情况下，美国可能根据艾森豪威尔主义和巴格达条约进行武装干涉，来维护以色列和约旦国王之间的协议。
