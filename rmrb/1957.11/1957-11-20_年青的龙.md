    Young Dragons
    Ma Deping
    The ranks of Young Pioneers are strung together like beads,
    Covering the embankments and hillsides,
    Water buckets, porcelain basins, small earthenware pots,
    Hanging from the hillsides like silver water chains.
    The gray earth drinks water and turns black-faced,
    The fish in the pond are disturbed and uneasy,
    Leaping out of the water to investigate:
    Wow, dozens of red dragons have come to the world!
    A hundred living dragons are not as powerful as these,
    If you still want drought, you can try with all your might,
    But it will be in vain—
    The little fish look up to the sky following the sound,
    Alas, the fiery sun also frowns and wears a mourning face.

    年青的龙
    马德平红领巾的队伍结成串，塘埂山岗全布满，水桶瓷盆小瓦罐，山岗上挂下一条一条银水链。灰土地喝水变黑了脸，塘里的鱼儿却搅得心不安，跃水腾空一打探：嚯，几十条红龙到人间。一百条活龙也不抵这厉害，再想旱灾啊，你拼上老命也
  枉然，——小鱼儿随着声音天上看，唉，火太阳也紧皱眉头哭丧
  着脸。
