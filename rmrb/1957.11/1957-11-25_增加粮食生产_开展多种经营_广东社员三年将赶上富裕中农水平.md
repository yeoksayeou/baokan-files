　　Increase Grain Production, Develop Diversified Economy
　　Guangdong Commune Members Will Catch Up with the Level of Rich Middle Peasants in Three Years

　　(Based on a report by this newspaper) The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, after studying the production and income situation of agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province on the 16th, affirmed that the vast majority of peasant households in the province can completely catch up with or exceed the production level and average income level of local rich middle peasants within the next three years (i.e., by 1960).

　　The Provincial Committee pointed out that before cooperativization in rural Guangdong, rich middle peasants accounted for about 15% of the total number of rural households, while poor and lower-middle peasants accounted for about 60%-70%. Now, less than two years after cooperativization, farmers' lives have undergone tremendous changes. In the first year of establishing cooperatives (1956), natural disasters were quite severe, and the operation and management of the cooperatives had not yet gotten on track. However, about 10% of the cooperatives had already caught up with the production level of rich middle peasants; the other cooperatives that had not caught up with rich middle peasants had about 30% of the farmers (including the original rich middle peasant households) whose income reached the level of rich middle peasants. It is estimated that this year, about 20% of the cooperatives and 35%-40% of the farmers (including the original rich middle peasant households) have already caught up with or exceeded the level of rich middle peasants. As for the other farmers, most of them are living the life of ordinary middle peasants, and only a dozen to twenty percent are still living the life of poor peasants. From these facts, it can be seen that in the next three years, with better management of cooperatives and greater improvement of production conditions, the growth rate of production and income levels of cooperatives will definitely be greatly accelerated compared to the previous two years.

　　The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China studied the experience of the cooperatives that have already caught up with the production level of rich middle peasants, proving that their most prominent feature is to first grasp the key link of grain production. According to a survey of 403 cooperatives in the alluvial soil areas of Zhongshan, Xinhui, and Panyu counties, the average yield of rice per mu in 1956 was 600 catties, exceeding the 480 catties per mu of rich middle peasants by 120 catties, thus enabling 69% of the cooperatives and 74% of the cooperative members to exceed the production and income levels of rich middle peasants. At present, most cooperatives in Guangdong's grain production have caught up with or are close to the level of rich middle peasants. In the future, as long as grain production is firmly grasped and various measures are taken, it is not a problem for the province to strive to catch up with the local rich middle peasant level in grain production within one or two years.

　　The Provincial Committee believes that actively developing a diversified economy is another important experience for these cooperatives to catch up with rich middle peasants. In 1956, Xinhui County, while striving to do a good job in grain production, vigorously developed animal husbandry and diversified economy, achieving increased production and income for 90% of the cooperatives, of which the income of about 50% of the farmers exceeded that of rich middle peasants. However, as far as Guangdong province as a whole is concerned, the diversified economy of cooperatives, especially the development of animal husbandry, is still far from the level of rich middle peasants. According to a survey by the Provincial Committee, the current production level of economic crops of lower-middle peasants in rural areas is about 20% lower than that of rich middle peasants (calculated by yield per unit area), and the production level of animal husbandry is about 30% lower. However, in terms of developing a diversified economy and animal husbandry, cooperatives have greater potential than rich middle peasants.

### 增加粮食生产　开展多种经营  广东社员三年将赶上富裕中农水平

    增加粮食生产　开展多种经营
    广东社员三年将赶上富裕中农水平
    本报讯　中共广东省委16日研究了全省农业生产合作社的生产和社员的收入情况后，肯定全省绝大多数农户在今后三年内（即到1960年）完全可以赶上或超过当地富裕中农的生产水平和平均收入水平。
    省委指出，广东农村在合作化前，富裕中农约占农村总户数15％左右，贫农和下中农约占60％—70％。现在，合作化不到两年，农民的生活已发生了巨大的变化。办社第一年（1956年），自然灾害相当严重，社的经营管理尚未走上轨道，但已有10％左右的社赶上了富裕中农的生产水平；其它没有赶上富裕中农的社，也大约有30％的农户（包括原有的富裕中农户）收入达到了富裕中农水平。今年预计，全省约有20％左右的社和35％—40％的农户（包括原有的富裕中农户）已经赶上或超过富裕中农的水平。至于其他农户，大部分都过着一般中农的生活，只有百分之十几到百分之二十还过着贫农生活。从这些事实可以看出，今后三年在合作社办得更好、生产条件有了更大改善的情况下，合作社的生产与收入水平增长的速度，肯定是会比前两年大大加快的。
    中共广东省委研究了已经赶上富裕中农生产水平的合作社的经验，证明它们最突出的是首先抓住粮食生产这一环节。据中山、新会、番禺三个县沙田地区四百零三个社的调查，1956年稻谷产量每亩平均六百斤，比富裕中农的亩产量四百八十斤超过一百二十斤，因而使69％的社和74％的社员超过了富裕中农的生产和收入水平。目前，广东粮食生产方面大多数社已经赶上或接近富裕中农水平，今后只要抓紧粮食生产，采取各种措施，全省范围内使粮食生产争取一、二年内赶上当地富裕中农水平，是不成问题的。
    省委认为，积极发展多种经营是这些合作社赶上富裕中农的另一个重要经验。新会县1956年在努力搞好粮食生产的同时，大力发展畜牧业和多种经营，就做到了90％的社增产增收，其中50％左右农户的收入超过了富裕中农。但是，就广东全省来讲，合作社的多种经营，尤其是畜牧业的发展，同富裕中农水平还距离较大。据省委调查，当前农村下中农的经济作物的生产水平比富裕中农相差约20％（按单位面积产量计），畜牧业的生产水平相差约30％。但是，在发展多种经营和畜牧业方面，合作社比富裕中农有很大的潜力。（新华社和本报记者共同采写）
