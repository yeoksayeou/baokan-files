    How to Further Promote the Patriotic Health Campaign?
    Advanced Experiences from Various Regions: Closely Integrate with Production, Actively Cultivate Key Personnel, Fully Mobilize the Masses, and Establish Necessary Systems

    This newspaper reports that the Ministry of Health convened a Patriotic Health Campaign Experience Research Conference in Beijing from November 11th to 15th. Representatives from 34 typical grassroots Patriotic Health Campaign units (including cities, rural areas, and various enterprise and institutional systems) from 15 provinces and cities exchanged their experiences over the past few years in adhering to the Patriotic Health Campaign and eliminating the four pests.
    The representative of Qile Township, Lechang County, Guangdong Province, introduced their experience of adhering to the Patriotic Health Campaign for five years, day after day, in conjunction with production, achieving basic elimination of the four pests, reducing diseases, improving attendance rates and environmental sanitation, and cultivating good hygiene habits in every household. He said: In addition to the leadership's attention and cadres setting an example, it is important to adopt a working method of differentiating between urgency and gradual progress, item by item, and consolidating item by item, according to the masses' ideological level and economic conditions, so that the masses are willing to accept and can adhere to implementation. In the work, close attention should be paid to the combination of shock campaigns and regular work; in the shock campaigns, on the one hand, attention should be focused on solving major problems, and on the other hand, attention should be paid to the implementation of regular hygiene systems. Carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign should also be closely integrated with production, using production gaps to carry out publicity, mobilization, and organizational work, and mobilizing and deliberating through large and small meetings to make it a conscious action of the masses. Representatives from Taiyang Village in Jishan County, Shanxi Province, and Yangxin County in Shandong Province, also repeatedly emphasized in their introductions: The Patriotic Health Campaign can only be carried out regularly, extensively and effectively if it is unified and arranged with production, relying on the organization of agricultural cooperatives, letting go and mobilizing the masses, fully utilizing social medical forces, closely integrating with production, and cooperating with the guidance of health technology.
    The representative of Wulao Village in Nanjing City, a national first-class health model unit in 1952, introduced their experience of maintaining the regularization of the health campaign since 1952 and continuously improving the level of hygiene. She said: Wulao Village attaches great importance to improving the masses' level of scientific knowledge in maintaining regularization, and has held health training classes for this purpose; attention has been paid to cultivating and mobilizing the backbone in the movement, rectifying organizations, revising various systems, and other work. In order not to make the masses busy with sanitation all day long and exhausted, it is necessary to set out various feasible systems. Such as the daily sub-area contracting system in the morning, the Patriotic Activity Day once every half month and the Patriotic Hygiene Day system once a week, as well as the cadre liaison meeting system once a month, so that the daily cleanliness and hygiene habits are consolidated. The first residents' committee of Shanyin Road in Hongkou District, Shanghai, and Wandezhuang Street in Tianjin also introduced their experience of combining central work, combining residents' daily life, flexibly using various publicity methods, and establishing convenient and easy-to-implement hygiene systems.
    Representatives from Fushun Open-pit Coal Mine, Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Factory, State-owned 724 Factory, and Shaanxi May 4th Agricultural Cooperative unanimously agreed in their introductions: The improvement of factory and mine hygiene lies in the leadership's attention and the establishment and improvement of organizations; cultivating key personnel, mobilizing the masses, and supervising each other; integrating workshop hygiene with production; vigorously publicizing and penetrating into families, while consolidating the established systems.
    In addition, the representative of Daqiying Agricultural Cooperative in Dongran Village Township, Haidian District, Beijing, introduced the experience of being sparrow-free, and the representative of Tianjin Vegetable and Grocery Company introduced the experience of maintaining hygiene and no fly larvae in the storage and sales of non-staple foods, fish and meat in summer. The representative of Mishihutong Primary School in Xuanwu District, Beijing, introduced the experience of the principal taking the lead and mobilizing children to do sanitation work. Other typical units such as agencies also made experience introductions.
    Qi Zhongyuan, Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Health, made a concluding speech at the meeting. He said that this meeting not only exchanged extremely extensive, vivid, and specific experiences, but also laid the foundation for summarizing the national experience and created favorable conditions for the development of future movements. He said that the development of the Patriotic Health Campaign should not be limited to the "three cleanness and three no's," and it is necessary to continuously enrich the content of the movement and improve the quality of the movement. In order to eliminate diseases and maintain the health of the people, all units should put forward different specific requirements and methods according to the actual situation.
    Comrade Qi Zhongyuan emphasized at the meeting that in order to more powerfully promote the development of the movement in the future, all localities are required to further summarize the past experiences. He said that the content of the summary mainly includes the combination of leadership and the masses, the combination of mass health movement and the development of production, and the combination of improving the masses' scientific and technical knowledge. The method of summarizing, units with a foundation in the past health movement can carry out a comprehensive and systematic summary; but some places, although the foundation of the entire health movement is poor, can also carry out a special summary if there are outstanding creative experiences in a certain link. He said that through the summary work, the experience of advanced units can promote the development of the entire movement in the local area; units that have not carried out the movement regularly in the past or have not carried it out well, summarizing the main problems in the work is also conducive to promoting the masses to change the status quo.
    Finally, Assistant Minister Qi Zhongyuan requested the units attending the meeting to further do a good job in summarizing, and must also actively lead the local masses to immediately carry out winter health work, and formulate a plan for regularly adhering to the Patriotic Health Campaign in a relatively long period of time in the future.

    如何进一步开展爱国卫生运动？
    各地的先进经验是：紧密结合生产　积极培养骨干充分发动群众
　建立必要制度
    本报讯　11月11日到15日，卫生部在北京召开了爱国卫生运动经验研究会。十五个省市三十四个基层爱国卫生运动典型单位（包括城市、农村及各企业、事业系统）的代表，在会上交流了几年来坚持开展爱国卫生运动消灭四害的经验。
    广东乐昌县岐乐乡的代表介绍了他们在结合生产的情况下，五年如一日的坚持爱国卫生运动，做到基本上消灭四害，减少疾病，提高出勤率和改善环境卫生，以及家家户户养成良好卫生习惯的经验。他说：除了领导重视，干部以身作则以外，重要的是根据群众思想水平和经济条件，采取分别缓急、逐项进行、逐项巩固的工作方法，使群众乐于接受，并能坚持执行。在工作中要密切注意突击运动和经常工作相结合；在突击运动中，一方面要着重解决主要问题，另一方面，要注意贯彻执行经常性的卫生制度。开展爱国卫生运动还要密切结合生产，利用生产空隙来进行宣传、鼓动和组织工作，并通过大小会议动员、酝酿，使它成为群众自觉的行动。山西省稷山县太阳村，山东阳信县等单位代表，在介绍经验中也一再强调：爱国卫生运动只有和生产统一安排、布置，依靠农业合作社组织，放手发动群众，充分运用社会医疗力量，紧密结合生产，配合卫生技术的指导，才能经常地广泛地有效地开展。
    1952年全国甲等卫生模范单位，南京市五老村的代表，介绍他们从1952年起一直保持卫生运动经常化，并不断提高卫生水平的经验。她说：五老村在保持经常化中非常重视提高群众科学知识水平，为此举办了卫生讲习班；注意了培养和发动运动中的骨干，整顿组织、修订各种制度等工作。为了不使群众整天忙于搞卫生，疲劳不堪，需要定出各种可行的制度。如每日早晨的分片包干制，半月一次的爱国活动日和一周一次的爱国卫生日制，以及一月一次的干部联系会议制度，使每日的整洁和卫生习惯巩固起来。上海市虹口区山阴路第一居民委员会、天津市万德庄街等单位也分别介绍了他们结合中心工作，结合居民日常生活，灵活运用各种宣传方式方法，以及建立方便易行的卫生制度的经验。
    抚顺市露天煤矿、天津市织染厂、国营七二四厂、陕西五四农业社等单位代表，在介绍经验中一致认为：厂矿卫生状况的改善，在于领导重视和建立、健全组织；培养骨干，发动群众，互相监督；使车间卫生同生产相结合；大力宣传，深入家属，同时必须巩固已建立的制度。
    此外，北京市海淀区东冉村乡大器营农业社代表介绍了无雀的经验，天津市蔬菜杂货公司的代表介绍了副食品、鱼肉等在夏季保管、销售工作中保持卫生和无蝇蛆的经验。北京市宣武区米市胡同小学代表介绍了校长带头行动，发动儿童做好卫生工作的经验。其他机关等典型单位也都作了经验介绍。
    卫生部齐仲垣部长助理对这次会议作了总结性的发言，他说，这次会议不仅交流了极为广泛、生动、具体的经验，并且为总结全国的经验打下了基础，也为以后运动的开展创造了有利条件。他说开展爱国卫生运动不应停留在三洁三无上，需要不断丰富运动的内容，提高运动的质量。为了消灭疾病，保持人民身体的健康，各单位应该根据实际情况，提出不同的具体要求和办法。
    齐仲垣同志在会上强调提出，为了更有力地推动今后运动的开展，要求各地进一步总结过去的经验。他说，总结的内容主要包括领导与群众相结合、群众卫生运动与发展生产、提高群众科学技术知识相结合等。总结的方法，在过去卫生运动有基础的单位，可以进行全面的系统的总结；但是有些地方整个卫生运动的基础虽然较差，而在某一环节上如果有突出的创造性的经验的，也可以进行专题总结。他说，经过总结工作，先进单位的经验可以推动当地整个运动的开展；过去运动开展得不经常或是没有很好开展的单位，把工作中的主要问题总结出来，也有利于推动群众改变现状。
    最后，齐仲垣部长助理要求到会的各单位，在进一步做好总结的同时，还必须积极地带动当地群众立即开展冬季卫生工作，并制定出今后在较长时期内经常坚持开展爱国卫生运动的规划。　　　（刘丽珊）
