Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 3rd. Over one thousand townships in Gansu Province have established broadcasting networks, installing a total of 18,500 loudspeakers. Many counties and cities have now reached the point where every township, commune, and team has loudspeakers. Farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in minority areas who have never had broadcasting services before can now listen to various policy-related and current affairs reports, as well as wonderful musical broadcasts, in their communes and homes. By the end of this year, more than 3,500 more loudspeakers will be installed throughout the province, at which time the province will average more than one loudspeaker per agricultural cooperative.

These broadcasting networks are mainly established with the strength of local agricultural cooperatives. The purchase of loudspeakers, wires, and other equipment is mainly paid for by the commune's public welfare fund; farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups erect broadcasting networks through voluntary labor, and the required electric poles are automatically donated by commune members or utilize idle wood.

According to relevant departments' plans, in 1958, except for individual minority areas, every county in Gansu Province will have a broadcasting station, and more than 15,000 loudspeakers will be installed in agricultural production cooperatives. Minority mountain areas that do not temporarily have the conditions to establish broadcasting stations will establish radio stations.

### 甘肃省一千多个乡  建立广播网

    甘肃省一千多个乡
    建立广播网
    新华社兰州3日电　甘肃省已有一千多个乡建立了广播网，安装的喇叭共有一万八千五百个。现在不少县市已达到每个乡、社和队都有喇叭。从未有过广播事业的少数民族聚居地区的各族农牧民们，现在也能在自己的社里和家里，收听到各种有关政策、时事报告和精彩的音乐广播节目。到今年年底，全省还要安装三千五百多只喇叭，那时全省平均每个农业社就有一个多喇叭。
    这些广播网主要是依靠当地农牧业社的力量建立起来的。购买喇叭、电线等器材主要由社内公益金开支；各族农牧民以义务劳动架设广播网，所需电杆由社员自动捐献，或利用闲置的木料。
    根据有关部门的计划，1958年甘肃省除个别少数民族地区，县县都将设有广播站，并在农牧业生产合作社再安装一万五千多只喇叭。暂时没有建立广播站条件的少数民族山区，都要建立起收音站。
