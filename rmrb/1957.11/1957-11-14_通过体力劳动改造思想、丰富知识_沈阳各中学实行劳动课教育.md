    Through Physical Labor, Transform Thought and Enrich Knowledge
    Shenyang Middle Schools Implement Labor Education
    (Reported by this newspaper) Shenyang City's middle schools have now universally launched labor education. Students unanimously support this measure, and the broad masses of teachers and students express their willingness to dedicate time to go to the countryside and factories to participate in labor.
    In order to further strengthen the political and ideological education of middle school students, foster in students a viewpoint and habit of loving labor, and cultivate students to become laborers who are politically conscious, culturally educated, and physically healthy, the Shenyang City Education Bureau has decided to establish a system for students in all middle schools to participate in physical labor. Currently, more than 43,700 students in Shenyang City's 44 middle schools have participated in various voluntary labor activities. Senior students are also going to the countryside and factories to participate in physical labor in the fields and workshops. Up to now, more than 22,900 students from 28 middle schools have gone to 60 state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Shenyang to participate in field labor for two to five days, helping farmers with the autumn harvest. Students from the 21st Middle School went to the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory to help clean up scrap iron, saving the country wealth worth more than 1,200 yuan in two days. In the labor, students from all middle schools received a profound and vivid education about the glory of labor and the true superiority of agricultural cooperativization.
    After going to the countryside to participate in voluntary labor, the students ate, lived, and labored together with the farmers. In their spare time, they also organized discussions and visits, inviting the directors of agricultural cooperatives to give them reports on the development of agricultural cooperatives. This enabled the broad masses of teachers and students to understand the current living conditions of the farmers, experience the thoughts and feelings of the working people, and also enriched their practical knowledge, which they could not obtain in the classroom for a long time.
    Actual participation in physical labor has also transformed the purely didactic educational style of some teachers. They have come to realize that cultivating students' labor viewpoints through actual participation in labor is more effective than pure lecturing. Moreover, they have profound content, feelings, and experiences when they themselves explain the superiority of agricultural cooperativization and the greatness of physical labor.
    Now, all the schools in Shenyang City that have participated in rural labor have initially established regular contacts with agricultural cooperatives. In the future, agricultural cooperatives can contact them if anything comes up. Starting from this semester, all middle schools in Shenyang City stipulate that one week each semester will be spent participating in physical labor.
    Currently, there are still ten schools in Shenyang City, with approximately 10,000 students, scheduled to go to 18 state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives in the next few days to participate in labor. (Liaoning Daily Editorial Department)

    通过体力劳动改造思想、丰富知识
    沈阳各中学实行劳动课教育
    本报讯　沈阳市各中等学校现已普遍展开劳动课教育。学生一致拥护这一措施，广大师生表示愿意抽出一定时间下乡下厂参加劳动。
    为了进一步加强中学生的政治思想教育，养成学生热爱劳动的观点和习惯，培养学生成为有政治觉悟、有文化素养、身体健康的劳动者，沈阳市教育局决定在各中学校学生中建立参加体力劳动的制度。目前，沈阳市四十四所中学里已有四万三千七百多名学生参加了各种义务劳动。高年级的学生并下乡、下厂，到田间和车间参加体力劳动。到目前为止，已有二十八所中学的两万二千九百多名学生到沈阳市郊六十个国营农场及农业合作社参加了两天到五天的田间劳动，帮助农民秋收。二十一中的学生到皇姑屯机车车辆厂帮助清理废铁，花了两天的时间就给国家节约了价值一千二百多元的财富。各中学的学生在劳动中受到深刻而生动的劳动光荣及农业合作化真正优越的教育。
    参加义务劳动的学生下乡后，都和农民同吃、同住、同劳动。空闲时并组织了座谈和访问，请农业社主任给他们做了农业社发展的报告。使广大师生了解了农民当前的生活情况，体会到劳动人民的思想感情，同时也丰富了他们长期以来在课堂上不能得到的实际知识。
    实际参加体力劳动后，也转变了某些教师单纯说教的教育作风。他们体会到以实际参加劳动来培养学生的劳动观点比单纯说教生效。而且在他们自己讲解农业合作化优越性以及体力劳动的伟大时也有了深刻的内容、感情和体会。
    现在，沈阳市已参加下乡劳动的各个学校都和农业社初步建立了经常性的联系，今后农业社有事就可以向他们打招呼。从这学期开始，沈阳市各中等学校每个学期都规定以一周的时间参加体力劳动。
    目前，沈阳市还有十所学校，约一万名学生预定在最近几日内相继前往十八个国营农场和农业生产合作社参加劳动。　（辽宁日报编辑部）
