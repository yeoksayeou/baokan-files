All Members of the Beijing Red Cross Society Protest the Shameful Activities of the United States in Creating "Two Chinas"

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Beijing Red Cross Society protested against the United States for using the International Red Cross Conference to create the shameful activity of so-called "two Chinas." After the plenary session of the International Red Cross Conference, under the manipulation of the United States, passed a proposal on the afternoon of the 7th to allow the Chiang Kai-shek clique members to attend the meeting under the name of the so-called "Republic of China," our government delegation and the Chinese Red Cross delegation lodged strong protests against this despicable action by the United States and withdrew from the meeting. Twenty-nine delegations from eighteen countries, including India and the Soviet Union, also withdrew from the meeting to protest. All members of the Beijing Red Cross Society expressed their full support for the just actions of our government delegation and the Red Cross delegation.
    In their statement on the 8th, they said: Taiwan has always been an integral part of Chinese territory, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique is not qualified to send representatives to participate in the International Red Cross Conference. We strongly protest against the United States' attempt to use the International Red Cross Conference to create "two Chinas." The United States should be held fully responsible for the interruption of the meeting due to the shameful activities of the United States government delegation.

    抗议美国制造“两个中国”的可耻活动
    本报讯　北京红十字会抗议美国利用国际红十字大会制造所谓“两个中国”的可耻活动。国际红十字大会全体会议7日下午在美国操纵下通过了让蒋介石集团分子以所谓“中华民国”的名义出席会议的提案后，我国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团对美国这种卑鄙的行动提出了强烈的抗议，并且退出会场。印度、苏联等十八个国家的二十九个代表团也都纷纷退出会场，表示抗议。北京市红十字会全体会员对我国政府代表团和红十字会代表团的正义行动，表示完全支持。
    他们在8日的声明中说：台湾从来就是中国领土的一部分，蒋介石集团根本没有资格派遣代表参加国际红十字大会，我们对美国利用国际红十字大会制造“两个中国”的行为提出强烈抗议。由于美国政府代表团的可耻活动，致使会议中断，美国应对此负完全责任。
