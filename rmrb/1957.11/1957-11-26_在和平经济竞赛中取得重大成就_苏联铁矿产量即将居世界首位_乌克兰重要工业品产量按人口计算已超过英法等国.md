Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd: According to Soviet press reports, the Soviet Union, possessing the world's largest iron ore reserves, will, in the coming years, become the country with the highest iron ore production in the world.

Among all countries, the Soviet Union's iron ore production currently ranks second only to the United States. At present, the United States' annual production of iron ore is approximately 100 million tons. Although the Soviet Union's output is temporarily lower, it is very close and shows a trend of catching up with and surpassing it. This year, the Soviet Union's iron ore production will increase to approximately 84 million tons; and by 1960, the final year of the current Five-Year Plan, this production target will rise sharply to 160 million tons. Preliminary estimates indicate that by then, the Soviet Union will surpass the United States in iron ore production and rank first in the world.

Facts support this claim.

First, for more than a decade after the war, the Soviet Union's iron ore production has been increasing rapidly every year. This is not the case with the United States. Generally speaking, the United States' iron ore production increased relatively quickly in the post-war years, but it still has not broken through the 120 million ton mark, and the production level is extremely unstable, with large fluctuations in annual production. In 1951, the United States produced 118.4 million tons of iron ore, the highest production year in its history. However, by the following year, it had fallen below 100 million tons. In 1953, it slightly exceeded the 1951 record, but the following year it declined sharply again, falling to 79.1 million tons. In the past two years, the United States' iron ore production has increased somewhat, but it has remained around 100 million tons. Thus, it seems unlikely that it will increase its iron ore production by another 40 to 50 million tons in the next three years (there has been no such precedent in the United States in the last forty years) to reach the level that the Soviet Union expects to achieve at that time.

Second, judging from the past forty years, the growth rate of iron ore production in the Soviet Union has also far exceeded that of the United States. For example, compared with 1913, the Soviet Union's iron ore production in 1957 has increased more than eightfold, while the United States' iron ore production has increased less than twofold in the same period.

In the next three years, the Soviet Union will increase its iron ore production by nearly twofold. According to a long-term plan, the Soviet Union will increase its annual iron ore production to 250 million to 300 million tons in the next fifteen years, which is more than three times the current annual production of iron ore in the United States. It is foreseeable that after 1960, the United States' iron ore production will fall further and further behind the Soviet Union.

In order to rapidly develop the iron ore mining industry, the Soviet Union is now building many large-scale iron ore mining bases in Siberia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and other places. At the same time, new iron ore deposits are constantly being prospected throughout the country. In 1913, Russia's proven iron ore reserves accounted for only a little more than 1% of the world's iron ore reserves, while by 1955, the Soviet Union already possessed more than 40% of the world's proven iron ore reserves. This is a strong potential that the Soviet Union can use to quickly increase iron ore production, which other countries do not have. With the development of the iron ore mining industry, the Soviet steel industry will also rapidly surge on a larger scale than in the past. In this way, it is possible for it to catch up with and surpass the United States in this area in a relatively short historical period and become the country with the largest steel production in the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th: In the peaceful economic competition with advanced capitalist countries in Western Europe, the Ukrainian Republic of the Soviet Union has achieved significant successes.

Calculated per capita, Ukraine's pig iron production has now caught up with and surpassed Britain and West Germany, steel production has exceeded Britain, coal production has exceeded West Germany, steel output has exceeded Britain and France, and sugar production is 5.6 times that of Britain and 2.7 times that of West Germany.

Forty years ago, industry in Britain and France was much more developed than in Ukraine, but now Britain's pig iron production is half that of Ukraine, and France even less; Ukraine's coal production is 2.3 times that of France.

### 在和平经济竞赛中取得重大成就  苏联铁矿产量即将居世界首位  乌克兰重要工业品产量按人口计算已超过英法等国

    在和平经济竞赛中取得重大成就
    苏联铁矿产量即将居世界首位
    乌克兰重要工业品产量按人口计算已超过英法等国
    新华社莫斯科23日电　据苏联报刊报道：铁矿储藏量居世界第一位的苏联，在最近几年内将发展成为世界上铁矿开采量最多的国家。
    在世界各国中，苏联的铁矿开采量现在仅次于美国。目前，美国铁矿砂的年产量大约为一亿吨，苏联的开采量虽然暂时还比它少，但是已经十分接近它，并且显示了即将赶上和超过它的趋势。今年，苏联的铁矿开采量就将增加到约八千四百万吨；而到目前五年计划的末一年1960年，这一生产指标将急剧上升到一亿六千万吨。初步估计，到那时，在铁矿开采量方面，苏联就会把美国扔在后面而跃居世界第一位。
    事实对这一点提供了根据。
    第一，战后十多年来，苏联的铁矿开采量每年都在迅速增加。而美国却不是这样。整个说来，美国的铁矿开采量在战后年代中是增加得比较快的，但是它仍然没有突破一亿二千万吨的大关，而且生产水平极不稳定，各年生产量上下波动很大。1951年，美国生产了一亿一千八百四十万吨铁矿砂，这是历史上产量最高的一年。但是，到第二年，就下降到一亿吨以下。1953年，又稍微突破了1951年的纪录，而次年又急转直下，降到七千九百一十万吨。最近两年，美国的铁矿开采量又增加了一些，但是仍然保持在一亿吨上下。这样看来，在今后三年中，它几乎没有希望把铁矿砂产量再增加四、五千万吨（最近四十年来，美国历史上还没有过这样的先例），而达到那时候苏联预计要达到的水平。
    第二，从过去四十年来看，苏联铁矿开采量的增长速度也大大超过美国。例如，和1913年比较，1957年苏联的铁矿砂产量已经增加了八倍多，而美国的铁矿砂产量在同时期还增加不到一倍。
    在今后三年中，苏联还要把铁矿砂产量增加将近一倍。而根据一个长远计划，苏联在今后十五年中就将把铁矿砂年产量提高为两亿五千万吨到三亿吨，即等于现在美国铁矿砂年产量的三倍以上。可以预料，在1960年以后，美国铁矿开采量还将越来越远地落在苏联后面。
    为了急速发展铁矿开采工业，苏联现在正在西伯利亚、哈萨克、乌克兰等地建设许多大规模的铁矿开采基地。同时，新的铁矿储藏地也不断在全国各地被勘察出来。1913年，俄国已经探明的铁矿储量只占全世界的铁矿储量的1％多一点，而到1955年，苏联就已经拥有全世界已探明的铁矿储量的40％以上。这是苏联能够借以很快提高铁矿开采量而为别的国家所没有的雄厚潜力。随着铁矿开采工业的发展，苏联钢铁工业生产也将以比过去更大的规模迅速高涨起来。这样，它就有可能在较短的历史时期内也在这方面赶上和超过美国，而成为世界上生产钢铁最多的国家。
    据新华社莫斯科25日电　在同西欧各先进资本主义国家展开的和平经济竞赛中，苏联的乌克兰共和国已经取得了重大的成就。
    按人口平均计算，乌克兰的生铁产量现在已经赶上和超过了英国和西德，钢产量已经超过了英国，煤产量已经超过了西德，钢材产量超过了英国和法国，沙糖产量已经等于英国的五点六倍和西德的二点七倍。
    四十年前，英国和法国的工业要比乌克兰发达得多，而现在，英国的生铁产量要比乌克兰少一半，法国少得还要多；乌克兰的煤产量已经等于法国的二点三倍。（附图片）
