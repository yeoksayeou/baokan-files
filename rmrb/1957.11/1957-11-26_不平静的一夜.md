    A Restless Night	Wen Mangyan
    Uncle Changgeng tossed and turned in bed until dawn,
    A thousand thoughts crashed open the gates of his memory,
    Suddenly, the old society stood before him like a ghost,
    The landlord's abacus clicked, his wife and children wept…
    He suddenly sat up and shook his old wife awake,
    He still couldn't understand the argument from last night:
    "People say I'm taking a step backward,
    Old woman, you judge this reasoning.
    What suffering of the old society haven't I tasted,
    What benefit of the new society haven't I seen,
    I handed over the oxen and land to the cooperative long ago,
    Haven't I been following the director's footsteps step by step?"
    His old wife, draped in her clothes, sat up with him,
    Every word she spoke weighed like a hammer:
    "Old man, people's eyes are like scales,
    We are on the same boat as everyone, but not sharing the same fate.
    How much work have you wasted raising ducks these past two years?
    It's like throwing away gold to pick up copper,
    The cooperative is a big family business, who doesn't treat it like home?
    But you, you've become someone who undermines it…"
    After a period of silence, he seemed to wake from a nightmare,
    He wept, using tears to clear his eyes:
    "The criticism is right, I've become a 'self-employed individual within the collective,'
    I'm like a greedy lone goose separated from the flock.
    A lone goose separated from the flock can't fly far,
    The path to personal wealth is a dead end,
    How can a healthy person know the bitterness of medicine,
    Repentance is bitter, but I must return to the flock…"
    Uncle Changgeng dragged his old wife to go outside:
    "Let's go and explain everything to the director,
    Besides the oxen and land handed over long ago,
    There's one more thing I've been hiding until now."
    The old wife was secretly startled upon hearing this,
    What else could he have been hiding until now?
    Uncle Changgeng said: We shouldn't be just half members anymore,
    Today, we must make up for our shortcomings and submit a patriotic, collective-loving heart to the cooperative.

    不平静的一夜	文莽彦
    长庚叔在床上翻滚到天明，
    千万个思潮冲开他记忆之门，
    突然，旧社会像个幽灵站在他前面，
    地主算盘响，妻儿一片哭声……
    他猛然坐起，将老伴推醒，
    昨夜一场争论，他还想不通：
    “人家说我走的是条回头路，
    老婆子，你把这个道理评一评。
    旧社会的苦楚我那点未尝尽，
    新社会的好处我那点未看清，
    耕牛田地我早就全盘入了社，
    一步一步不都跟着社长的脚印。”
    老伴陪着他，披衣坐起身，
    她的每一句话有铁锤一样重：
    “老头子，人家的眼睛都是秤啊，
    我们和大家同上一条船，没共一条命。
    这两年你贩鸭子误了多少工，
    这好比丢掉黄金去捞铜，
    合作社是个大家业啊，谁不以社为家，
    你呢，倒做了一个挖墙脚的人……”
    一阵沉默，他如刚做醒一场恶梦，
    他流泪了，在用泪水洗亮自己的眼睛：
    “批评得对呀，我成了个‘社内单干户’，
    我好比一只贪婪孤雁离了群。
    离了群的孤雁飞不远啊，
    个人发财这条绝路走不通，
    不害病的人怎知药味苦啊，
    后悔药难吃，我也要归群……”
    长庚叔拖着老伴要往外走：
    “我们去和社长说说清，
    除了耕牛田地很早入了社，
    还有一个东西隐瞒到如今。”
    老伴听了暗暗吃一惊，
    还有什么东西隐瞒到如今？
    长庚叔说：我们不该再做半个社员了，
    今天，要向社里补交一颗爱国爱社心。
