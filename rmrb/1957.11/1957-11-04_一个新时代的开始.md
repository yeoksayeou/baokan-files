The Beginning of a New Era
Ma Dayou, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Following the successful launch of the first artificial Earth satellite, the Soviet Union launched its second artificial Earth satellite yesterday. This satellite carries not only scientific instruments but also the first living guest (a dog) in the upper atmosphere. This is truly a scientific miracle, breaking all scientific research records.

In less than a month since the launch of the Soviet artificial satellite, we have already gained valuable knowledge about the density and temperature of the upper atmosphere. We will further understand the conditions and composition of the ionosphere, the geomagnetic field, cosmic rays, solar radiation, the shape of the Earth, its electrical charge, and so on, all of which were previously impossible for people to do. The launch of artificial Earth satellites has opened up an infinite treasure trove of knowledge for us. A thick atmosphere covers our heads, greatly limiting our horizons. The rays from celestial bodies (including the sun) are diverse, ranging from extremely short waves to very long waves, and include both charged and uncharged particles, but most of them are blocked by the atmosphere, leaving only a small window. For thousands of years, we could only observe the universe through this window (using visible light waves, with wavelengths of about 0.4 to 0.8 microns). Until recently, our knowledge of the universe did not exceed the scope of what optical telescopes could observe. In recent years, radio researchers have discovered a second larger window in the atmosphere (using radio waves, with wavelengths from a few millimeters to a few meters). Short radio waves have brought us a wealth of new knowledge about the universe, laying the foundation for the novel discipline of radio astronomy. The success of artificial satellites is no longer a matter of windows; it has opened the doors of the atmosphere, allowing people to observe the universe (including the Earth we live on) through various electromagnetic waves (from the shortest gamma rays to the longest radio waves) and charged particle radiation (cosmic rays). This is truly an epoch-making event. The success of artificial Earth satellites has further enabled mankind to take the first step in conquering the universe and achieving space flight. In the past, people were unable to escape the effects of Earth's gravity, just like Sun Wukong could not escape the palm of the Buddha. Some scientists even calculated that it was impossible to leave the Earth's gravity. But the success of artificial satellites has made this statement obsolete. Scientists are already planning how to fly to the moon and Mars. It should be said that the full significance of this new development cannot be fully estimated today. October 4, 1957, is a milestone in human history, the beginning of a new era of transforming nature.

The manufacturing of artificial Earth satellites is a very complex and highly integrated technical problem. We know that satellites are launched using three-stage rockets. After the third stage rocket begins to burn, its flight direction is parallel to the ground. Before this, the rocket has been rising along a predetermined trajectory. Controlling the rocket to rise along a predetermined trajectory and enter the final orbit requires a very complex and precise automatic control system. Understanding the working conditions of each engine, the vibration conditions it causes, obtaining accurate data on gyroscopic stabilizers and the burning and extinguishing of each stage, etc., are all necessary to understand whether the rocket is operating normally and to further research and improve it. This requires a very complex radio tracking telemetry system. Moreover, after the artificial Earth satellite has entered its orbit, we hope that it will report the conditions of the upper atmosphere, such as temperature, and also hope that it will emit radio signals that can be used to determine the characteristics of the ionosphere, and constantly measure its position, direction of movement, and speed. These are all requirements for the radio tracking telemetry system. This requires a very complex radio system, which may include special techniques such as pulse position modulation, frequency modulation, and pulse width modulation conversion, using different wavelengths and bandwidths, and must have highly efficient receiving and transmitting antenna systems. The radio equipment on the rocket and artificial satellite must be extremely lightweight; any increase in weight and volume will increase the requirements for the rocket. Obviously, it must also be power-saving. The radio equipment on the rocket and artificial satellite must work under very harsh conditions; the surrounding temperature and pressure are abnormal, and the acceleration it is subjected to may be very high. In all these cases, its work must be reliable. Therefore, monitoring the operation of the rocket and obtaining important information from the artificial Earth satellite require the most advanced radio technology.

The two artificial Earth satellites launched by the Soviet Union both used radio waves of two wavelengths (15 meters and 7.5 meters; it is known in communication that the former is significantly affected by the ionosphere, while the latter is not) to obtain data on the ionosphere. This is an important scientific creation and a very significant contribution. Until now, the only way we can observe the ionosphere is to send radio waves from the ground to the sky and measure and record the reflected waves. In this way, we can only observe the conditions below the most ionized part of the ionosphere. The radio waves emitted from the ground will continue to pass through after passing the most ionized part and will not be reflected. Therefore, we are not clear about the conditions above the most ionized part, and we cannot even determine whether there is a boundary at the top. We do not know how thick the ionosphere is. Now, this situation has passed. By using two different radio waves to determine the direction from which they are coming and comparing it with the direction determined by optical methods, we can find the refraction of these two radio waves when they pass through the ionosphere, and thus discover the propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere, and further deduce the structure and composition of the ionosphere. This is not only a great advancement for radio science but will also allow us to further understand the structure of the upper atmosphere and the absorption of solar ultraviolet light. In addition, artificial Earth satellites have also proposed various new possibilities for radio communication, which will be gradually realized in the future. The success of the Soviet artificial Earth satellites has completed a sudden change in the development of science and technology, and the driving role of radio science is one aspect of this sudden change.

As a scientific worker, I believe that the successful launch of the Soviet artificial Earth satellites is of great educational significance. First of all, we see from it the superiority of the socialist system. Forty years ago, Tsarist Russia was originally the poorest and most backward among the imperialist countries, and political corruption was also notorious. However, in the past forty years, under the socialist system, the Soviet Union has not only built itself into a highly industrialized socialist country, but in terms of the level of science and technology, as can be seen from the success of artificial satellites, it has made the United States, which ranks first among capitalist countries, look on in astonishment. The artificial Earth satellite planned by the United States weighs less than ten kilograms and requires an eleven-ton rocket to send it into orbit. It was originally expected to be launched next spring. But there is no certainty yet, because just the test rocket burned up when it rose to 100 kilometers. Weight is also a major problem. According to American estimates, every pound of weight added to the artificial satellite will reduce its final speed by 80 feet per second. However, the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite weighed 83.6 kilograms, almost an order of magnitude higher than the American plan. The difference in degree is obviously not a matter of a few months. Does not this great achievement of the Soviet Union in science and technology, from scientific backwardness to surpassing the most advanced capitalist United States in forty years, fully prove the superiority of the socialist system?

The key to the Soviet Union's achievements lies in the leadership of the Communist Party. The leadership of the Communist Party enables science and technology to truly serve the people. In the United States, on the contrary, science and technology are controlled by monopoly capitalists. – This is a resounding slap in the face to the rightists who attack the Party, saying that laymen cannot lead experts, while it is actually laymen who lead science in their cherished imperialist United States. – Don't you see that when the inspiring call of the Soviet artificial Earth satellite came, the first reaction in the United States was that the stock prices of companies related to the artificial Earth satellite soared? Who controls scientific research, and who gets the greatest benefit from scientific research? Isn't this a very clear explanation? It is no accident that the Soviet Union has greatly surpassed the United States in its achievements in atomic energy power plants, thermonuclear weapons, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and this time in artificial Earth satellites.

The Soviet Union's achievements also illustrate the necessity of conducting scientific research in an organized and planned manner. The research work on artificial Earth satellites is a highly comprehensive work, requiring the solution of many complex problems that have not been solved before in physics, mathematics, chemistry, metallurgy, jet technology, automatic control, radio technology, instrument manufacturing, and other aspects. Only under strict organization and by fully mobilizing the strength of researchers in various fields can such an epoch-making great contribution be made. Americans certainly understand this point as well. During World War II, the United States also achieved success and experience in the organizational work of radar and atomic bomb research. But this approach contradicts the interests of monopoly capital. In the research work on artificial Earth satellites, the research and manufacturing work of the three-stage rocket must be contracted out to three large companies separately so that "benefits are equally distributed." Their army is angry at the navy for taking exclusive control of the power and says sarcastic things. In addition, McCarthyism has also excluded many honest scientists. How can we talk about fully mobilizing all scientific forces? Here is another lesson for the rightists who demand that national scientific work should not have a locomotive and should "suit people". I wonder what they think of the great success of the Soviet artificial satellite?

    一个新时代的开始
    中国科学院电子学研究所筹备委员会副主任　马大猷
    跟着第一个人造地球卫星发射成功以后，苏联又在昨天发射出第二个人造地球卫星。在这个卫星上，不但携带着科学仪器，还带着大气上层第一个有生命的客人（狗）。这真是科学上的奇迹，打破了一切科学研究的纪录。
    自从苏联人造卫星发出以后，不到一月时间，我们已经获得了很多有关大气上层密度和温度的宝贵知识。我们还要进一步了解电离层的情况和组织成分，地磁场、宇宙线、太阳辐射以及地球形状、带电情况等，这些都是以前人们办不到的。人造地球卫星的发出给我们打开了无穷的知识宝库。我们头上笼罩着一层厚厚的大气，大大地限制了我们的眼界。天体（包括太阳）射来的射线本来是多种多样的，从极短的波到很长的波，也有带电和不带电的粒子，但是绝大部分都被大气遮掉了，剩下的主要只有一个小小的窗口。几千年来我们只能通过这个窗口（用可见光波，波长约在零点四到零点八微米之间）观测宇宙，直到最近，我们对宇宙的知识都不超过光学望远镜所能观察的范围。近年来，无线电研究者才发现了大气的第二个较大的窗口（用无线电波，波长由几毫米到几米），短无线电波给我们带来了大量有关宇宙的新知识，奠定了射电天文学这一个新颖学科的基础。人造卫星的成功，那就已经不是窗口问题，它使大气的门户洞开，人们有可能通过各种电波（从最短的γ射线直到最长的无线电波）和带粒子的射线（宇宙线）来观测宇宙（包括我们居住的地球在内），这实在是划时代的大事。人造地球卫星的成功还进而使人类走上了征服宇宙，实现宇宙飞行的第一步。过去，人们是无法脱离地心引力的作用的，就像孙悟空离不了如来佛的掌心一样。有的科学家还计算过，离开地心引力是不可能的。但是人造卫星的成功，使这个说法成为过时的了。科学家已经在计划着如何飞往月球，如何飞往火星了。应该说这个新发展的全部意义今天还是无法充分估计的。1957年10月4日是人类历史上的里程碑，是一个改造自然界的新时代的开始。
    人造地球卫星的制造是一个非常复杂、高度综合性的技术问题。我们知道，卫星是用三级火箭发射出去的。第三级火箭开始燃烧以后，它的飞行方向就同地面平行了，在这以前，火箭一直是沿着预定的弹道上升的。控制火箭沿预定弹道上升进入最后的公转轨道去，是需要非常复杂而精确的自动控制系统的。了解每一级发动机的工作情况，所引起的振动情况，获得回转稳定器以及各级燃烧和灭火的准确数据等，都是了解火箭运行是否正常以及进一步研究改进所必需的，这就需要一个非常复杂的无线电追踪遥测系统。还不仅如此，在人造地球卫星已进入公转轨道以后，我们希望它把大气上层的情况如温度等报告下来，也希望它发出能够据以测定电离层特性的无线电信号，并经常测定它的位置、运动方向和速度，这些都是对于无线电追踪遥测系统的要求。这样就需要非常复杂的无线电系统，其中可能包括脉位调制、频率调制、脉宽调制转变等特殊技术，使用不同的波长和带宽，而且一定要有效率极高的接收和发射的天线系统。火箭上和人造卫星上的无线电设备必须是极端轻巧的，任何重量和体积的增加都将提高对火箭的要求，显见它也必须是省电的。火箭和人造卫星上的无线电设备要在很坏的条件下工作，周围温度和气压都是不正常的，所受加速度可能很大，在所有这些情况下，它的工作必须是可靠的。因此，监视火箭的运行以及从人造地球卫星获得重要的信息都需要最先进的无线电技术。
    苏联两次发射的人造地球卫星都利用两种波长（十五米和七点五米，在通信中知道前者受电离层的显著影响，而后者不甚受影响）的无线电波以获得电离层的资料，这是重要的科学创造，贡献非常大。一直到现在，我们观测电离层的办法还只有从地面上向天空发出电波，测量和记录反射波的一个方法。这样我们所能观测的只有电离层中电离程度最强部分以下的情况，地面上发出的电波过了电离最强部分以后就要继续穿过，不发生反射了。因此电离最强部分以上的情况我们是不清楚的，甚至上面到底有没有界限都不能确定，电离层究竟有多厚就更不知道了。现在这个情况是过去了。用两种不同的无线电波，定出它们射来的方向，同光学方法定出的方向相比，我们就可以求出这两种电波穿过电离层时受到折射的情况，因而发现电离层中电波传播的情况，并进而推出电离层的构造和成分。这不但对无线电科学是很大的推进，也将使我们对大气上层的构造以及太阳紫外光被吸收的情况得到进一步的了解。此外，人造地球卫星还为无线电通信提出种种新的可能，今后将逐渐实现。苏联人造地球卫星的成功，在科学技术的发展上完成了一次突变，对无线电科学的推动作用，是这个突变中的一方面。
    作为一个科学工作者，我认为苏联人造地球卫星的发射成功是有很大教育意义的，首先，我们从它看到社会主义制度的优越性。四十年前的帝俄本来是在帝国主义国家中最贫穷落后的，政治腐化也很出名，但是四十年来苏联在社会主义制度下不但建设成了高度工业化的社会主义国家，在科学技术的水平上，从人造卫星的成功可以看出，已使资本主义国家中占第一位的美国瞠乎其后了。美国计划的人造地球卫星不到十公斤，要用一个十一吨的火箭把它送到轨道上去，原想到明年春天能发出。但是还没有把握，因为光是试验火箭就在升到一百公里时烧掉了。重量也是一个很大的问题，按美国估计，人造卫星的重量每增加一磅，就要使它的最后速度减少每秒八十英尺，而苏联的第一个人造卫星重八十三点六公斤，几乎比美国计划中的高一个数量级，程度的相差很明显也不是几个月时间的问题了。苏联在科学技术上的这个伟大的成就，在四十年中由科学落后而超过最先进的资本主义美国，还不充分证明社会主义制度的优越性么？
    苏联成就的关键还在于共产党的领导，共产党的领导使科学技术真正为人民服务。而在美国呢，正好相反，科学技术是被垄断资本家掌握的。——这里给了右派分子们一个响亮的耳光，他们攻击党，说外行不能领导内行，而真正由外行来领导科学的是在他们向往的帝国主义美国。——君不见，苏联人造地球卫星的振奋人心的呼号传来，在美国的第一个反应就是同人造地球卫星有关的公司股票大涨其价？谁掌握着科学研究，谁从科学研究取得最大利益，这不是很明显的说明吗？苏联在原子能发电站，在热核子武器，在洲际弹道导弹，这一次又在人造地球卫星的成就上大大超过美国，这不是偶然的。
    苏联成就还说明科学研究工作有组织、有计划进行的必要性。人造地球卫星的研究工作是高度综合性的工作，需要物理、数学、化学、冶金、喷气技术、自动控制、无线电技术、仪器制造等方面解决很多以前没有解决的复杂问题，只有在严密的组织下，充分发挥各方面研究人员的力量，才可以作出这样划时代的伟大贡献来。美国人当然也是了解这一点的，在第二次世界大战中，美国在雷达和原子弹研究的组织工作中也取得了成绩和经验。但是这种作法是和垄断资本的利益矛盾的，在人造地球卫星的研究工作中，三级火箭的研究制造工作就要分别包给三个大公司承揽，以便“利益均沾”。他们的陆军看着海军独揽大权，就气愤，说风凉话。此外麦卡锡主义还把许多正直的科学家排斥掉。如此等等，怎么能谈到充分发挥一切科学力量？这里又给右派分子上了一堂课，他们要求国家科学工作不要火车头，要去“就人”，不知他们看到苏联人造卫星的伟大成功作何感想？
