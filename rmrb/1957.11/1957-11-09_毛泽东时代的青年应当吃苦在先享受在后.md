    Youth in the Mao Zedong Era Should Endure Hardship Before Enjoying Comfort

    Some apprentices think they have been deceived by being sent to work as general service workers. This idea is wrong. The state spends money to teach you culture, politics, and technology, and also gives training awards to the masters to encourage them to train you well. Is this all deception? Now, due to work needs, some apprentices are being drawn to work as general service workers. What pain do you feel in your heart? Youth in the Mao Zedong era should endure hardship before enjoying comfort. As long as the country needs it, they should obey without hesitation. Think about it, if the comrades who participated in the 25,000-li Long March all thought like you, could the revolution have been victorious?

    毛泽东时代的青年应当吃苦在先享受在后
    有的徒工认为去当勤杂工，是受了骗，这种想法是错误的。国家拿钱叫你们学文化、学政治、学技术，还给师傅培训奖，鼓励师傅好好地培养你们，难道这都是受骗吗？现在由于工作需要，抽出一部分徒工去当勤杂工，心里有什么酸疼呢？毛泽东时代的青年应当吃苦在先，享受在后，只要国家需要，就应毫不犹疑地服从。想一想，参加二万五千里长征的同志，如果都像你们那样想法，革命能胜利吗？
