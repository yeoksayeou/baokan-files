    Come Taste Our Dumplings!
    On the noon of the 2nd, Wang Zengjun, director of the 21st workshop of the Beijing Wired Electrical Equipment Factory, invited Soviet elder brothers to his home for dumplings.
    The invited guests included Comrade Rabeski, the chief expert of the workshop, Comrade Andronov, an assembly expert, and Comrade Shvirev, a young calibration expert.
    When the distinguished guests arrived, the young couple was busy making dumplings. Comrades Rabeski and Shvirev said that when eating at home, everyone should help, and we should also make some. Wang Zengjun's wife, Guo Meiyi, said: It is our Chinese custom to invite elder brothers to our home for dumplings during festivals, so let us make them! Shvirev said: "No! We also want to learn how."
    Lunch began, and Comrade Zhu Shunfu, the deputy director of technology of the workshop, was busy running around serving dishes and rice. Little Zhu had studied at the Red Dawn Factory in Leningrad, Soviet Union, last year, and his teachers were today's guests, Comrades Rabeski and Andronov, so he was especially happy today, sweating profusely, offering toasts and acting as an interpreter.
    The small room was filled with an atmosphere of friendship, and the hosts and guests jointly congratulated the upcoming great festival.
    Speaking of these experts, Wang Zengjun couldn't express his gratitude enough. In August, when he had just taken over the job, he was not familiar with this new work, and the scrap rate reached 30%. When he was in distress and anxiety, Comrade Rabeski told Wang Zengjun to calm down and helped him find a way to get the work on track; in September, the scrap rate of this workshop dropped to 5%.

    尝尝我们的饺子吧！
    2日中午，北京市有线电器材厂第二十一车间主任王增俊招待苏联老大哥来家吃饺子。
    应邀而来的有车间的主任专家拉别斯基同志和装配专家安德洛诺夫同志，还有年青的校试专家什维里也夫同志。
    当贵客们到时，年青的夫妇正在包饺子。拉别斯基和什维里也夫同志说，在家里吃饭应该大家下手，我们也来包。王增俊的爱人郭美意说：请老大哥到家里来吃饺子是我们中国人过节日的习惯，还是让我们包吧！什维里也夫说：“不！我们也要学学看。”
    午餐开始了，忙着跑上跑下端菜端饭的是车间技术副主任朱顺福同志。小朱去年曾到苏联列宁格勒红霞工厂去学习了一年，他的老师就是今天的客人拉别斯基和安德洛诺夫同志，所以他今天特别高兴，忙的满头大汗，又要敬酒，又要当翻译。
    小小房间里，充满友谊的气氛，宾主共同为即将到来的伟大的节日而祝贺。
    提起这几位专家，王增俊有说不出的感激。8月份自己刚接工作不久，对这一新的工作很不熟悉，废品率达到30％，正在苦闷焦急时，拉别斯基同志告诉王增俊沉住气，帮助他想办法，使工作步入正规；9月份这个车间的废品率就降低到了5％。　　　（高粮）（附图片）
