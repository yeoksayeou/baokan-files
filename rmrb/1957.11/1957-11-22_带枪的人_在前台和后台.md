"The Man with the Gun," written by the outstanding Soviet playwright Pogodin in 1937 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the October Revolution, was the first dramatic work to create the image of the great leader Lenin. The Beijing People's Art Theater's production of "The Man with the Gun" is also the first appearance of Lenin's image on the Chinese stage since liberation. To successfully bring the revolutionary teacher onto our stage, using the Chinese language to speak his concise and powerful, simple and wise words to our audience, is a major achievement of Chinese dramatic art. It can be said that this is a major event in the history of Chinese drama. To change the scenery thirteen times, to have more than a hundred people on stage, to play the images of great figures like Lenin and Stalin, in the past we couldn't even imagine it. Thanks to the Vakhtangov Theater and many Soviet comrades for their help, which enabled us to overcome countless difficulties and successfully create the images of Lenin, Shatov, Chibisov, and many other characters.

Shatov, a simple and loyal farmer, but like all working people, he has his own alertness and wisdom. Under the real education of the revolutionary storm, he gradually understands the truth of the revolution, and step by step grows into an active fighter defending the Soviet regime, and brings out his latent strength and talent. The development of this character, like the development of the entire play, is so simple and so real, without any decoration or polishing, without a trace of "formulaic concept," so Shatov and the whole play appear more real, powerful, and moving. There is no "play" here, only real struggle and life! From the ordinary, short dialogues, we understand the great and profound revolutionary truth, and learn the superb and outstanding socialist realism dramatic art. When we, like Shatov with the gun, step by step enter a new realm of enlightenment in our ideology and consciousness, we can't help but raise our guns with Shatov and shout "Hurrah," cheering for the October Revolution!

When the audience in the theater sees the cheers for the October Revolution on stage and is inspired and applauds enthusiastically, behind the lights and smoke, behind the revolving stage, hundreds of actors and stage workers are frenetically busy, happily working, and cheering from the bottom of their hearts.

Why not? It is such a big play, and in such a short period of time, the scenery has to be changed thirteen times, and so many people have to be on stage; naturally, the backstage cannot be anything but extremely tense and bustling. All the actors of the Beijing People's Art Theater are on stage, and even the administrative staff are on stage playing the masses. Actors who used to play major roles now also ask to join the ranks of the masses and participate in the "October Revolution." But there are still not enough actors, and many actors play two, three, four, five, or six roles; as the stage rotates, everyone is busy changing costumes, rushing to play different roles, and striving to go on stage to participate in the "October Revolution."

All the stage staff are busy backstage, but they are still overwhelmed, so many actors also help to move props and change scenery on stage. The stage manager uses a loudspeaker to constantly direct the actors and staff, reminding everyone who should be on stage and who should be prepared. People running around, props being moved, voices rising and falling, everyone is tense and boiling.

A battle bulletin was posted backstage, and the actors put forward guarantees for the seriousness of the creation and the youthfulness of the performance, to complete the entire performance consistently and tirelessly. They guarantee not to miss a scene, and no longer need the stage manager to use a loudspeaker to remind the actors to go on stage, and also propose to guarantee the saving of electricity and water, and challenge other work groups. The stage installation group also put forward guarantees, that the scenery changes will be faster in time. The fourteen scenes now only take fifteen and a half minutes, averaging just over one minute per scene, but they also put forward many rationalization proposals, demanding to further shorten the scene change time. The makeup group, the lighting group, the costume group... also responded to the challenge and welcomed the battle. Because all the actors and staff are on stage, even the staff of the theater's nursery automatically extended their working hours, so that parents would not be distracted from picking up their children. The entire theater is invested in the performance of "The Man with the Gun," highly giving play to the strength of the collective, and everyone involved in the work feels honored and excited.

Never has there been a play that is so tense, so lively, so exciting, so joyful; so much like a factory that is rushing to complete an urgent task, and also like a front line that is engaged in a fierce battle. Everyone is enthusiastically excited, and there is an unspeakable great power that is inspiring all the people. How could it not be so? Because the images of Lenin and Stalin are among us, because our front stage and backstage have become the glorious Smolny, because we are performing the great historical event of the October Socialist Revolution, which shook the world and opened up a new era for all mankind! All of us, with or without guns, are loudly and enthusiastically cheering for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution!

    “带枪的人”在前台和后台
    舒绣文
    苏联杰出的剧作家包哥廷在1937年为了庆祝十月革命二十周年而写的“带枪的人”是第一次在戏剧作品里创造了伟大领袖列宁的形象。北京人民艺术剧院“带枪的人”的演出，也是列宁形象在解放后的中国舞台上的第一次出现。使革命导师成功地出现在我们的舞台上，用中国语言向我们的观众说出他那简洁而有力的，朴实而睿智的话，是中国戏剧艺术的一大成就。可以说，这是中国戏剧史上的一件大事。要换十三次景，要一百多人上场，要扮演列宁、斯大林这样伟大人物的形象，在过去我们是想都不能想像的。感谢瓦赫坦戈夫剧院和许多苏联同志的帮助，使我们克服了无数困难成功地塑造了列宁、雪特林、契毕索夫以及许多其他人物的形象。
    雪特林，一个纯朴忠实的农民，但也像所有的劳动人民一样，他有他自己的机警和智慧，他在革命大风暴的现实教育之下，逐渐地了解了革命的真理，一步紧接一步地成长为捍卫苏维埃政权的积极战士，并且发挥出他潜在的力量和才能。这一人物的发展也像整个戏的发展一样，是那样朴素，那样真实，丝毫没有修饰雕琢之处，看不出一点“公式概念”，因而雪特林和整个戏，就显得更加真实有力。更加感人动人了。这里没有“戏”，这里只有真正的斗争和生活！我们从平凡的简短的对话里，体会出伟大的深刻的革命真理，学习到高超杰出的社会主义现实主义的戏剧艺术。当我们像带枪的雪特林那样在思想意识上一步一步地步入豁然开朗的新境界的时候，我们都会情不自禁地随着雪特林举起枪来高喊“乌拉”，欢呼十月革命！
    当观众在剧场里看到台上在欢呼十月革命而受到鼓舞、而热烈鼓掌的时候，在灯光烟幕之后，在旋转的舞台的后面，成百演员和舞台工作者正在狂热地奔忙，愉快地工作，从心底里欢呼。
    怎么不呢？是这样大的一个戏，在这样短促的时间里要换十三场景，要有这样多的人上场；自然，后台不可能不紧张万分、热火朝天地工作的。整个北京人民艺术剧院的演员都上了台，连行政人员也登台扮演群众了。向来演主要角色的演员，现在也都要求参加到群众的队伍里，参加“十月革命”了。但是演员还是不够，好多演员一赶二，一赶三，一赶四五六；随着舞台的旋转，大家忙着改装换衣服，赶着换演不同的角色，争取到舞台上去参加“十月革命”。
    所有的舞台工作人员都在后台奔忙着，但还是忙不过来，于是许多演员也帮着在台上搬道具换布景。舞台监督用扩音器在不断地指挥演员和工作人员，提醒大家，谁该上场，谁该准备。跑来跑去的人，搬来搬去的道具，忽高忽低的声音，大家都紧张着、沸腾着。
    在后台贴出了战斗报，演员纷纷提出保证创作的严肃性和演出的青春，始终不懈地完成整个演出。保证不误场，不再要舞台监督用扩音器提醒演员上场，还提出保证节约用电用水，并且向其他工作组挑战。舞台装置组也提出了保证，换景在时间上还要加快，现在十四场景只用十五分半钟，平均每场只用一分多钟，但还提出许多合理化建议，要求再缩短换景时间。化装组、灯光组、服装组……也都响应挑战，迎接战斗。因为全体演员和工作人员都上了台，连剧院的托儿所的工作人员也自动延长工作时间，不要家长分心接带孩子。整个剧院都投入了“带枪的人”的演出，高度地发挥了集体的力量，所有参加工作的人都感到光荣和兴奋。
    从来没有一个戏，像这样紧张，这样热闹，这样兴奋，这样欢乐；这样像一个正在赶着完成紧急任务的工厂，又像正在进行着激战的前线。大家都热烈兴奋，有一种说不出的巨大的力量在鼓舞着所有的人们。怎么会不是这样呢？因为列宁、斯大林的形象在我们中间，因为我们的前台和后台变成了光荣的斯莫尔尼，因为我们是在演出着震撼世界的，为全人类开辟了新纪元的十月社会主义革命的伟大历史事件！我们所有带枪的或不带枪的人都在为十月革命四十周年高声地热烈欢呼！
