From the Readers

    Inappropriate Publicity
    The "Shanghai Pictorial" has published three issues and has been welcomed by many readers because it tells readers about the development of the motherland's film industry, film shooting dynamics, and the activities of filmmakers. This is beneficial to strengthening the connection between filmmakers and the audience.
    However, the "Shanghai Pictorial" also has some rather serious shortcomings. A small portion of its content promotes things that are contrary to the Party's policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, hard struggle, educating the people with communist thought, closely connecting with the masses, and sharing weal and woe with the masses. For example, it inappropriately introduces actors' extravagant family meals, the luxurious furnishings in actors' homes, and actors engaging in personal entertainment such as playing with tropical fish. It is a fact that due to the nature of their work, the lives of literary and art workers are more comfortable than those of ordinary working people. However, the editors do not need to be so interested in publicizing these personal private lives that are far removed from the living standards of the people. Instead, they should focus on publicizing how they seriously and earnestly engage in artistic creation, as well as their style of going deep into life and learning from the working masses. Only in this way will the audience love and respect them even more.

    不适当的宣传
    “上影画报”已出版了三期，受到许多读者欢迎，因为它告诉了读者祖国电影事业的发展情况，电影拍摄动态以及电影工作者的活动等。这对密切电影工作者与观众的联系是有好处的。
    但，“上影画报”也存在着相当严重的缺点，其中少量篇幅宣传的东西，是与党的勤俭建国、艰苦奋斗，以共产主义思想教育人民，密切联系人民群众和与群众同甘共苦的方针相违背的。例如：不适当地介绍了演员在家庭用饭时的阔绰场面，演员家中的豪华摆设，以及演员在玩弄热带鱼等个人娱乐的内容。由于文艺工作者的工作特点，生活比一般劳动人民优裕些，这是事实。但编者不必如此有兴趣地宣扬这些个人远离人民生活水平的私生活。而应该着重去宣传他们如何认真、严肃地从事艺术创作，以及他们深入生活、向劳动群众学习的作风，也只有这样才使观众更加热爱和尊敬他们。
