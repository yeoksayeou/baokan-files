    Stir-fried Shredded Carrot with Pork

    Carrot is a nutritious vegetable and also a good fruit. It not only contains a good amount of Vitamin B and C, but also a large amount of carotene. Carotene can be converted into Vitamin A in the human body. Carrots also contain more sugar, so they taste sweeter than other radishes.

    There are many ways to cook with carrots. Whether braised or stewed in soup with pork, beef, or lamb, or added to various stir-fried meat dishes, it can not only enhance the color's beauty, but also add a sweet taste.

    The following is an introduction to how to make stir-fried shredded carrot with pork:

    First, wash the carrots and shred them; shred the pork (or beef) as well. Heat oil in a wok; first stir-fry the shredded meat with soy sauce and wine, and set aside; then heat oil in the wok again, add the shredded carrots and stir-fry, add a little salt, add the shredded meat, and stir-fry for two minutes until it is ready. Finally, if you can add some green garlic, the flavor will be even more fragrant; and it will add green to the dish, making it even more beautiful. It should be noted that carrots should not be stir-fried for too long, as they will not taste good if they are overcooked; they must be half-cooked.

    胡萝卜炒肉丝
    胡萝卜是一种营养丰富的蔬菜，也是一种很好的水果。它不仅维生素乙和丙的含量不少，而且含有大量的胡萝卜素。胡萝卜素在人体内，可以变成维生素甲。胡萝卜所含的醣分也比较多，所以味道比其它萝卜甜。
    用胡萝卜做菜，花样很多。它无论与猪、牛、羊肉红烧或炖汤，或是加在各种荤腥炒菜中，不仅可以增加颜色的美观，而且味道甜美。
    下面介绍胡萝卜炒肉丝的做法：
    先把胡萝卜洗净，切成细丝；猪肉（或牛肉）也切成细丝。起油锅；先把肉丝加酱油、酒炒好，盛起；再起油锅，把胡萝卜丝放下去炒，略加点盐，把肉丝加下去，炒两分钟即好。最后，如能加些青蒜，味道更香；并且使菜内增加了绿色，更加美丽。应该注意的是，胡萝卜不能炒得太久，烂了不好吃，必须是半生的。
