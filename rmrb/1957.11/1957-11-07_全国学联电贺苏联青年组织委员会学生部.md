Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The All-China Students' Federation sent a telegram on the 4th to the Student Department of the Soviet Youth Organizations Committee, representing all Chinese students in congratulating the Soviet students on the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

The telegram stated that, for the past forty years, under the glorious leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the great Soviet people have not only achieved brilliant victories in national economic construction but also remarkable achievements in cultural and educational undertakings. The Soviet Union is the first country in the world to have a strong intelligentsia belonging to the working people and serving the cause of communism. The Soviet Union is the country with the most developed cultural and educational undertakings in the world. The recent successful launch of two artificial satellites eloquently proves that Soviet science and technology have leaped to the forefront of the world. These achievements are not only the pride of the Soviet people but also the pride of all Chinese people and the working people of the world.

The telegram also stated that Chinese students are firmly following the direction put forward by the great October Revolution, striving to cultivate themselves into completely new intellectuals belonging to the working class, and to improve their Marxist-Leninist ideological level and master modern scientific knowledge. We sincerely congratulate the Soviet students—our brothers and sisters—on their new achievements in learning and life for the happiness of the working people and for the great cause of building communism.

    全国学联电贺苏联青年组织委员会学生部
    新华社6日讯　中华全国学生联合会4日致电苏联青年组织委员会学生部，代表全中国学生向苏联学生祝贺十月革命四十周年。
    电报说，四十年来，伟大的苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党领导下不但在国家经济建设方面获得了辉煌的胜利，而且在文化教育事业中取得了卓越的成就。苏联是世界上第一次出现了强大的、属于劳动人民的、为共产主义事业服务的知识分子队伍的国家，苏联是世界上文化教育事业最发达的国家，苏联最近发射二颗人造卫星的成功雄辩的证明苏联的科学技术已跃居世界的首位。这些成就不仅是苏联人民的骄傲，也是全中国人民和全世界劳动人民的骄傲。
    电报又说，中国学生坚定地沿着伟大十月革命所提出的方向，为把自己培养成为完全新的、属于工人阶级的知识分子，为提高自己的马克思列宁主义思想水平和掌握现代科学知识而奋斗。我们热诚地祝贺苏联的学生——我们的兄弟姐妹们为了劳动人民的幸福、为了建设共产主义的伟大事业而在学习和生活中获得新的成就。
