    Lenin at the Pravda Office
    Pà Ā'ěrsījí (帕·阿尔斯基)
    One night in the summer of 1917, I was lying on a bunk in the barracks, writing a poem entitled "For the Honor of Mother Russia." I later recited it at a general meeting of the whole regiment, and the soldiers liked the poem very much.
    Some time later, two soldiers came to find me.
    "Where is your soldier's poem?" one of them asked.
    "In my pocket," I replied.
    "Good, let's go immediately!"
      "Where to?"
      "To the Pravda editorial office."
    We went, and the editorial office was buzzing with activity. The secretary was surrounded by many people—some with letters, some with notebooks. When it was my turn, I showed him my piece of paper. The secretary glanced at it and nodded his head towards the door:
    "Go ahead, take it over there..."
    He wanted to add a few more words, but was interrupted by impatient visitors—soldiers from the front line and young factory workers.
    I went into the office and saw a desk piled high with documents, behind which sat a man, writing something with his head tilted.
    "Do you have something?" he asked politely.
    "It's a poem...a soldier's poem." I said embarrassedly, putting the small piece of paper on the desk.
      "Please sit down!" the comrade said, pointing to a chair. He began to read my poem with great concentration, then stood up from the desk.
    "We will publish it! Ah, tell me about your regiment. Which regiment are you from?"
    "The Pavlovsky Regiment."
    "Ha! The Fourth Company of your regiment was the first to take up arms to fight against autocratic rule!" When I mentioned that the soldiers were against the war, he paced quickly around the room, saying:
    "The war must end, and the sooner the better! The army is exhausted, they are against this massacre... Have you been to the front?" he asked, putting a hand on my shoulder.
    "Yes!" I replied, "The soldiers at the front are being betrayed, with no ammunition and no food."
    "That's right! Your poem speaks of this." He glanced at the piece of paper again. "No! We don't need war... The army can and should turn its guns on its oppressors—the landlords and capitalists! The Pavlovsky Regiment should now stand at the forefront of our revolutionary army."
    I walked out, deeply moved by this man's words. He spoke with great friendship and sincerity about the pressing issues of us soldiers. What he said was exactly what we had discussed more than once.
    Seeing me come out, the secretary asked, "Well, how did your poem go?"
      "That comrade agreed and promised to publish it."
    The secretary smiled, "If Vladimir Ilyich said so, then the poem will be fine."
    "Lenin!" I exclaimed with great excitement.
    My friends were waiting impatiently for me on the street. I hurried to tell everyone what had happened in the editorial office.
    The soldiers listened greedily, and then blamed me:
      "Oh, you fool! Why didn't you talk to Lenin more about our life as soldiers. He should know everything!"
      "But he seems to know everything very clearly!"
  Three days later, my "Soldier's Poem" was published in Pravda.

    列宁在真理报社
    帕·阿尔斯基
    1917年夏天有一天夜里，我伏在营房中的吊铺上，写了一首诗，题目是“为了俄罗斯母亲的荣誉”。我后来在全团的一次大会上念了它，兵士们都欢喜这首诗。
    过了些时候，有两个兵士来找我。
    “你的大兵诗在哪儿？”他们当中有一个这样问。
    “就在口袋里。”我回答。
    “好，马上走吧！”
      “到哪儿去？”
      “真理报编辑部。”
    我们去了，编辑部里正忙得不可开交。秘书周围挤了许许多多的人——有的拿着信，有的带着小本。依次轮到了我，我把自己的纸片给他看。秘书瞧了瞧，头向门那边一摆：
    “去吧，你拿到那儿去……”
    他还想再补充几句，却被等得不耐烦的来访者——前线来的兵士和工厂的小伙子打断了话头。
    我走进办公室，只见写字台上文件堆积如山，后面坐着一个人，正侧着头在写些什么。
    “您有事情吗？”他很有礼貌地问。
    “是首诗……兵士的诗。”我把小纸片搁在桌子上，怪难为情地说。
      “请坐！”这位同志指着圈椅说。他开始聚精会神地读我的诗，然后从桌旁站了起来。
    “我们要刊登它！啊，谈谈你们团里的事情吧。你是哪一个团的？”
    “巴甫洛夫团。”
    “哈！你们团的四连是第一个拿起武器向专制统治作斗争的！”当我说起了兵士们都反对战争，他一面在房内很快地走动，一面说话：
    “战争必须结束，而且愈快愈好！军队疲劳不堪，他们反对这场屠杀……你在前线呆过吗？”他把一只手放在我肩上问。
    “是的！”我回答，“前线的兵士被出卖了，弹尽粮绝。”
    “对了！你诗上就讲到这个。”他重新朝纸片瞥了一眼。“不！我们不需要战争……军队能够并且应该把枪口对准自己的压迫者——地主和资本家！巴甫洛夫团如今应站在我们革命军队的最前列。”
    我走出来，深深地被这个人的话所激动了。他怀着巨大的友情非常诚挚地谈到我们当兵的切身问题。他谈的这些话，也正是我们不止一次地议论过的。
    秘书见我出来了，就问：“嗯，你的诗怎么样了？”
      “那位同志同意了，答应要登出来。”
    秘书微笑了一下：“要是弗拉基米尔·伊里奇这么讲过了，那么这诗就能行了。”
    “列宁！”我带着莫大的激动嚷了出来。
    朋友们不耐烦地在街上等着我。我急忙把在编辑部里的情景一五一十地告诉大家。
    兵士们贪馋地听着，后来就责备起我来了：
      “唉呀，你这个傻瓜！为什么不向列宁多谈一些咱们当兵的生活。他一切都该知道的！”
      “可是他对一切都知道得挺清楚哪！”
  过了三天，我的“兵士的诗”就登载在真理报上了。
