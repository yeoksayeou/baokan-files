The Ministry of Culture, having achieved a decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, had, by the end of October, seen more than 60% of its units successively enter the third stage, focusing on rectification. Some units are currently experiencing a high tide of airing views, and a few units that transitioned earlier have moved from comprehensive airing to thematic airing. The airing of views in individual units has largely concluded, and thematic debates have begun.

On October 28th, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, delivered a mobilization report on behalf of the Ministry of Culture's Rectification Leadership Group to the heads of its affiliated units and some members of the public.

In his report, Qian Junrui proposed five key points for the Ministry of Culture's rectification: First, to improve and strengthen the Party's leadership, truly placing cultural work under the leadership of the Party, and to rapidly change the current situation in some units where there is no Party organization or the Party's leadership is very weak. Second, in order to gradually establish a strong cultural and artistic force, armed with Marxism-Leninism, serving socialism, and truly belonging to the proletariat, it is necessary to strengthen the proletarianization of the thought and stance of cultural and artistic workers from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois backgrounds, while striving to cultivate new forces that meet these requirements. Third, to make cultural work more firmly based on China's actual conditions, starting from the 650 million people, closely cooperating with socialist construction, and truly becoming a powerful tool for socialist education and service to socialist construction for the masses of the people. Fourth, to improve the system, streamline institutions, and transfer personnel. Fifth, to resolutely improve the leadership style, especially the bureaucratic, subjectivist, and business-like work styles, as well as the idea of special privileges. He particularly emphasized that among the above five key points, the most important task at present is to focus on improving the system, streamlining institutions, and transferring personnel. Departments and bureaus should merge where they should merge, shrink where they should shrink, and resolutely abolish those that should be abolished. The majority of directly affiliated units should be resolutely transferred to local authorities to effectively strengthen the Party's leadership over cultural undertakings, strengthen the connection between cultural work and the grassroots masses, and at the same time, change the Ministry of Culture's current shortcomings of "managing what's underfoot but not managing the world" and even failing to manage what's underfoot well. It is estimated that the total number of people transferred to Beijing will be over 10,000, most of whom will take turns participating in agricultural production for training.

In addition, according to the original plan, the Ministry of Culture began to convene forums for leaders of various departments, bureaus, and directly affiliated units from October 29th to solicit opinions on the leadership of the Ministry of Culture. Many responsible Party cadres posted big-character posters in the Ministry of Culture building to express their views, putting forward many good suggestions. At present, the big-character posters posted by the masses in the Ministry of Culture building are colorful, dazzling, and ubiquitous. The airing of views in many units has also begun to form a high tide, with content that is broader than before, ranging from principles and policies, systems and institutions, leadership style, and Party-masses relations, to daily life and wages and benefits, covering everything. As of now, according to statistics from forty-four units, including those since the rectification, the masses have raised a total of 65,211 opinions. Most units attach great importance to these opinions from the grassroots, and have carefully sorted, classified, analyzed, and studied them. A batch of issues that could be resolved immediately have already been resolved. However, leaders at all levels have not been quick enough to make changes based on the opinions already raised by the masses. So far, the forty-four units have only revised 7,089 items, accounting for 10.8% of all opinions.

    文化部整改中首先要解决的问题
    改进体制　紧缩机构　下放干部
    本报讯　文化部在反右派斗争已经取得决定性胜利的基础上，到10月底止，已有60％以上的单位陆续转入以整改为主的第三阶段，其中一部分单位目前已经形成鸣放高潮，少数转得较早的单位已由全面鸣放进入专题鸣放，个别单位的鸣放已经大体上结束，开始专题争辩。
    10月28日文化部钱俊瑞副部长代表文化部整风领导小组对所属各单位负责人及部分群众作了动员报告。
    钱俊瑞在报告中提出文化部整改的五个重点：第一、健全和加强党的领导，把文化工作真正置于党的领导之下，迅速改变目前有些单位没有党组织或党的领导力量十分薄弱的现象。第二、为了逐步建立强大的、有马列主义思想武装的、为社会主义服务的、真正属于无产阶级自己的文化艺术队伍，必须加强出身于资产阶级、小资产阶级的文化艺术工作者的思想和立场的无产阶级化，同时努力培养合乎这种要求的新生的力量。第三、使文化工作更坚定地从我国实际情况出发、从六亿五千万人民出发，与社会主义建设密切配合，真正成为向人民群众进行社会主义教育的为社会主义建设服务的强大工具。第四、改进体制，紧缩机构，下放人员。第五、坚决改进领导作风，特别是官僚主义、主观主义、事务主义和特殊化的思想作风。他特别强调指出：在以上五个重点中，目前首先要抓住改进体制、紧缩机构和下放人员。各司、局机构该合并的合并，该缩小的缩小，该撤销的坚决撤销，大部分直属单位要坚决地下交地方，以有效地加强党对文化事业的领导，加强文化工作与基层群众的联系，同时，改变文化部目前“管了脚下，没管天下”甚至脚下也没管好的缺点。预计下放北京市的人数总数将在一万以上，其中大部分将轮流参加到农业生产中锻炼。
    此外，文化部还根据原定计划，自10月29日起开始分批地召集各司局和直属单位的领导人举行鸣放座谈会，对文化部领导提意见，不少党员负责干部在文化部大楼贴出了鸣放大字报，提出许多好的意见。目前文化部大楼内群众张贴的大字报已经五色缤纷、琳琅满目、到处皆是了。许多单位鸣放也开始形成高潮，内容较前广泛，从方针政策、体制机构、领导作风、党群关系，到日常生活和工资福利，应有尽有。截至目前为止，据四十四个单位统计，连同整风以来的在内，群众共提出意见六万五千二百一十一条。大部分单位对这些来自下层的意见非常重视，分属分类地进行了认真的整理和分析研究，对可能马上办到的已解决了一批。但各级领导对群众已经提出的意见，改得还不够迅速，四十四个单位至今已改的共七千零八十九条，占全部意见的10．8％。
