Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 22nd: American newspapers and political figures continue to criticize Eisenhower's recent two speeches as attempts to conceal from the American public the truth about the United States lagging far behind the Soviet Union in missiles and certain scientific and technological fields.

Alsop, in an article published in the "Washington Post," pointed out that Eisenhower's speech was a "whitewash." He said that the President promised in his speech to tell the public "unpleasant things and pleasant things," but he actually deliberately minimized or even "remained silent" about the "unpleasant things," and deliberately exaggerated the "pleasant things."

The article said: "The President once said, 'Our ballistic missiles have successfully flown three thousand five hundred miles.' What he did not say was that the missile that flew three thousand five hundred miles was a crude, experimental tool with absolutely no military use; it will be at least several years before we can have a usable missile that can attack targets three thousand five hundred miles or more away. The President once said, 'Our scientists and engineers have solved the problem of re-entry into the atmosphere,' and he showed a nose cone of an army missile to 'prove' this. What he did not say was that the nose cone he showed re-entered the atmosphere at a relatively easy-to-solve speed, which is much slower than the speed required for usable long-range missiles. What he did not say was that the re-entry problem of missiles that must re-enter the atmosphere at speeds twenty or more times the speed of sound has not been solved."

The article said that Eisenhower also "failed to mention that his own government's intelligence believes that the Soviet Union must already have a usable medium-range missile system, and we will have to wait at least three years to have such a thing." Alsop believes that this shows that the United States "government wants to whitewash problems involving its own reputation and achievements," and he pointed out that this way of deceiving the public "is a dangerous thing."

Senator Butler pointed out that Eisenhower's first speech was a rehash, "the content is news that was published two years ago." The Democratic National Committee also distributed a document listing twenty factual materials from Eisenhower's speech, and pointed out that this was "similar to the materials extracted from the speaker's guide published for Armed Forces Day in 1955." Butler pointed out that the President's "leftovers" material raises "a serious question: is the government telling the public the real facts they have a right to know?"

    艾森豪威尔花言巧语被揭底
    美国舆论抨击他最近的演说是粉饰美国科学落后的真相；是欺骗公众；是旧调重弹……
    据新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国报纸和政界人士继续抨击艾森豪威尔最近的两次演说是企图在美国公众面前掩盖美国在导弹及若干科学技术领域方面大大落后于苏联的事实真相。
    艾尔索普在“华盛顿邮报”上发表文章指出，艾森豪威尔的演说是一种
  “粉饰”。他说，总统在演说中保证要告诉公众“不愉快的事和愉快的事”，但是他实际上对“不愉快的事”有意加以缩小或甚至“闭口不谈”，对“愉快的事”有意加以夸大。
    文章说：“总统曾经说，‘我们的弹道导弹已经成功地飞行了三千五百英里。’他所没有说的就是，飞行三千五百英里的导弹完全是一种毫无军事用途的、粗制滥造的试验性工具；至少再要隔几年我们才能拥有一种对三千五百英里或三千五百多英里以外的地方的目标进行攻击的可以使用的导弹。总统曾经说，‘我国的科学家和工程师已经解决了重新进入大气的问题’，他还展示了一枚陆军导弹的头部圆锥体来‘证明’这一点。他所没有说的就是，他所展示的头部圆锥体以比较易于解决的速度重新进入了大气，这个速度比可以使用的远程导弹所需的速度要慢得多。他所没有说的还有：那些必须以二十倍或者二十多倍于音速的速度重新进入大气的导弹的重新进入问题并没有解决。”
    文章说，艾森豪威尔也“没有提到，他自己的政府的情报认为，苏联一定已经拥有一种可以使用的中程导弹系统，而我们至少要等三年才能拥有这种东西。”艾尔索普认为这表明美国“政府想为牵涉它自己的名望和成绩的问题进行粉饰”，他指出这种欺骗公众的办法“是一件危险的事情”。
    参议员巴特勒指出，艾森豪威尔的第一个演说是旧调重弹，“内容是两年前发表过的消息”。民主党全国委员会还散发了一份材料，列举艾森豪威尔演说中二十点事实材料，并且指出这同“1955年为武装部队日发表的演说者指南中摘下的材料相似”。巴特勒指出，总统的“炒冷饭”材料提出了“一个严重的问题：政府是否在告诉公众他们有权利知道的真正事实。”
