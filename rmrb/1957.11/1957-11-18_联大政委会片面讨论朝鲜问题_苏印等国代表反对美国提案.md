Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th. TASS reports: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its debate on November 15th on the proposal regarding the Korean question put forward by the United States and ten other countries. This proposal suggests unifying Korea based on the conditions put forward by the United States and other countries that participated in the aggression against Korea.

    During the debate, the representatives of Belgium, Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines all made speeches slandering the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China, opposing direct negotiations between South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and advocating for arming the South Korean army with modern weapons.

    The representative of Byelorussia, G.G. Grelukho, opposed the US proposal in his speech. He pointed out that discussions on the Korean question without the participation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would not make any progress, and would only benefit certain groups in achieving their aim of concealing their policy of aggression against the Korean people and the people of neighboring countries. Grelukho said that convening a conference of relevant countries with the participation of representatives from both North and South Korea would help to justly resolve the Korean question.

    The representative of Ceylon, Gunawardena, believed that the US proposal was a form of support for the South Korean regime. He said that this support would not help the real resolution of the Korean question in any way. He said that, whether some people liked it or not, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea existed, and therefore this fact should be taken into account when discussing and resolving the issue of Korean unification. Gunawardena advocated that the United Nations should promote the easing of tensions between North and South Korea and arrange for contact between them.

    The representative of India, Menon, spoke last. He said that Korean unification could only be achieved on the basis of mutual understanding and in accordance with the wishes of the Korean people themselves. He emphasized that interference in Korean internal affairs would not lead to a solution of the problem, and he opposed the eleven-nation proposal.

    The next meeting on the Korean question is scheduled for November 18th.

    联大政委会片面讨论朝鲜问题
    苏印等国代表反对美国提案
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会15日继续就美国等十一国提出的关于朝鲜问题的提案进行辩论。这项提案建议根据美国和参加侵略朝鲜的其他国家提出的条件来统一朝鲜。
    在辩论中，比利时、澳大利亚、泰国、菲律宾代表的发言都是对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中国进行诽谤，反对南朝鲜和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国举行直接谈判，并且鼓吹用现代化武器武装南朝鲜军队。
    白俄罗斯代表格列布科在发言中反对美国提案，他指出，讨论朝鲜问题没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国参加就不会有什么进展，并且只会有利于某些集团达到掩饰它们对朝鲜人民和朝鲜邻国人民的侵略政策的目的。格列布科说，召开有南北朝鲜代表参加的有关国家会议将有助于朝鲜问题的公正解决。
    锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼认为美国提案是对南朝鲜政权的一种支持。他说，这种支持丝毫无助于朝鲜问题的真正解决。他说，不管某些人是否喜欢，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国存在着，因此，在讨论和解决朝鲜统一问题时，就应该考虑到这个事实。古纳瓦地尼主张联合国应该促进南北朝鲜紧张局势的缓和，安排南北朝鲜的接触事宜。
    印度代表梅农最后发言。他说，只有在互相谅解的基础上，按照朝鲜人自己的意愿才能实现朝鲜统一。他强调指出，干涉朝鲜内政不会导致这个问题的解决，他反对十一国提案。
    关于朝鲜问题的下一次会议定在11月18日举行。
