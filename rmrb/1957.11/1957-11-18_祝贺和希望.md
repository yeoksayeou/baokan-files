    Congratulations and Hopes
    Wu Wen
    Following Chen Jingkai's breaking of the world record in the clean and jerk in the bantamweight class, and Qi Lieyun's creation of a world record in the 100-meter breaststroke, yesterday our female high jumper Zheng Fengrong broke the world record for women's high jump with a score of 1.77 meters, surpassing the previous record of 1.76 meters. We would like to express our warm congratulations on this new achievement.
    In 1954, Zheng Fengrong could only jump over 1.46 meters. After four years of hard training, she improved her score by more than 30 centimeters. This year alone, she has jumped over 1.70 meters eight times. Zheng Fengrong's ability to break the world record this time is inseparable from her hard training.
    Before liberation, China's sports were very backward. In the short few years after liberation, thanks to the Party and government's emphasis on sports, the backwardness of sports left over from the old society has been fundamentally changed. Mass sports activities have been widely carried out throughout the country, and the level of sports has been significantly improved. The vast majority of sports have not only far exceeded the level before liberation, but many sports have reached or approached the world level. China's outstanding athletes have repeatedly won honors for the motherland in international competitions. For example, at the Third World Youth Games held in Moscow in July this year, Chinese youth athletes achieved excellent results, scoring points in nineteen events and setting a world record in one event. In many other international competitions, Chinese athletes have also achieved excellent results.
    Our outstanding athletes, such as Chen Jingkai, Qi Lieyun, Zheng Fengrong, Zhang Hong, Lin Jinzhu, Cai Yishu, as well as some athletes in basketball, football, volleyball, table tennis and other ball games, have demonstrated outstanding skills in competitions, as well as good moral character such as hard training, courage, tenacity, lack of arrogance, and modesty. Their good style of work has played a concrete and effective role in the communist education of the masses. Their achievements have powerfully promoted the development of mass sports in our country.
    However, we must not be satisfied and intoxicated with these existing achievements. It should be seen that the current level of many of our sports is still far behind the world level, the existing achievements are not yet consolidated, and many knowledge and experiences have not been well grasped. It should be recognized that the achievements created by Chen Jingkai, Qi Lieyun, Zheng Fengrong, and others are only the beginning of China's sports level reaching the world level, and more arduous tasks are yet to come. Therefore, every one of our athletes, especially those who have made outstanding achievements, should always maintain a humble attitude, be neither arrogant nor impetuous, be indomitable, study hard and practice diligently, and make even greater efforts to create better achievements and win greater honor for the motherland.

    祝贺和希望
    吴文
    继陈镜开打破最轻量级挺举世界纪录，戚烈云创一百公尺蛙泳世界纪录之后，昨天我国女子跳高运动健将郑凤荣又以一公尺七十七公分的成绩打破了一公尺七十六公分的女子跳高世界纪录。这个新成绩的获得，我们在这里表示热烈的祝贺。
    郑凤荣在1954年只能跳过一公尺四十六公分，经过四年的艰苦锻炼，她把成绩提高了三十多公分，在今年内她就八次跳过一公尺七十公分。郑凤荣这次能打破世界纪录，是同她的艰苦锻炼分不开的。
    解放前，我国的体育很落后。解放后的短短几年中，由于党和政府对体育运动的重视，旧社会留下来的体育方面的落后面貌已根本改观。群众性体育运动在全国范围内广泛开展，体育运动水平有了显著的提高，极大多数的运动项目不仅远远超过解放前的水平，而且有不少项目已达到或接近世界水平。我国的优秀运动员，在国际比赛中曾多次为祖国争到了荣誉。例如，今年7月，在莫斯科举行的第三届青年友谊运动会上，我国青年运动员取得了很好的成绩，在十九个项目中得了分，并有一项创造了世界纪录。在另外的很多国际比赛中，我国的运动员，也曾获得了优异的成绩。
    我们的这些优秀运动员，如陈镜开、戚烈云、郑凤荣、张鋐、林锦珠、蔡艺墅，以及篮、足、排、乒乓等球类方面的一些运动员，他们在竞赛中表现了卓越的技术，表现了艰苦锻炼、勇敢顽强、不骄不馁、朴实谦逊等良好的道德作风。他们的良好作风具体而有效地对广大群众起了共产主义的教育作用。他们的成绩有力地推动了我国群众体育运动的开展。
    但是我们决不能满足和陶醉于这点已有的成绩。应该看到，我们许多项目的现有水平比世界水平还差很多，现有的成绩还不巩固，许多知识和经验还没有很好地掌握。应该认识到像陈镜开、戚烈云、郑凤荣等创造的成绩，不过只是我国运动水平达到世界水平的开始，更艰巨的任务还在后面。因此，我们每个运动员，特别是创造了优异成绩的运动员，应该永远保持谦逊的态度，不骄不馁，百折不挠，勤学苦练，为创造更好的成绩，为祖国争取更大的荣誉而作更巨大的努力。
