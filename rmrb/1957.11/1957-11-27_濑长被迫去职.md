Sesoko Forced to Resign

    The US occupation authorities on Okinawa have resorted to all possible means to force Naha City Mayor Kamejiro Sesoko out of office, reflecting the fear of the American colonialists towards the latent rebellious sentiment of the Okinawan people.

    Kamejiro Sesoko is the leader of the Okinawa People's Party. He was elected Mayor of Naha City on December 25th last year. The People's Party has always stood at the forefront of resolutely opposing the US military occupation policy. Sesoko has been repeatedly persecuted by the US military authorities for this and was imprisoned for nearly two years. The US military authorities were naturally extremely displeased with Sesoko's election as Mayor of Naha City, the capital of Okinawa, and therefore put pressure on him from the outset, attempting to force him to step down. Initially, the US military authorities adopted the method of freezing the Naha City government's deposits in the Ryukyu Bank, implementing an economic blockade; subsequently, they attempted to force the Ryukyu legislature to pass anti-communist legislation in order to create an excuse to drive Sesoko out; in June of this year, the Naha City Council, manipulated by the United States, once passed a vote of no confidence against Sesoko, but with the support of the Okinawan people, Sesoko dissolved the City Council. The result of the re-election was that the progressive forces supporting Sesoko won twelve seats out of the thirty seats in the City Council, which eliminated the possibility of the City Council passing a vote of no confidence against him again with a two-thirds majority. According to Ryukyu law, if the City Council expresses no confidence twice, the mayor must resign. Now, the US military authorities have taken the arbitrary measure of destroying the law and enacting legislation at will, announcing the revision of the Ryukyu Islands' local autonomy law and election law, changing the past provision that a vote of no confidence in the mayor could only be passed with the approval of more than two-thirds of the legislators to a simple majority of more than one-half. According to this new regulation of the US military authorities, the Naha City Council finally passed another "vote of no confidence" against Sesoko on November 25th. Although the long-planned conspiracy to drive Sesoko out has succeeded, the exhausted appearance of the US military authorities is also completely exposed. Since the law can be changed at will with a mere order from the military authorities, what is there to talk about "local autonomy" and "democratic elections"? This is truly the greatest irony!

    The fact that Kamejiro Sesoko was able to be elected Mayor of Naha City, to persist in governing for nearly a year under the "encirclement and suppression" and strong pressure of the US military authorities and local reactionary forces; and to double the number of seats supporting him in the parliament during the August elections, can only be explained by one reason: this is the Okinawan people's support for him. The main campaign slogans put forward by Sesoko were: oppose the US military's requisition of land to expand military bases, return Okinawa Island to Japan, and stop the US military control of Okinawa's finances and trade. Sesoko and the People's Party he leads have proven to the people through their actions over the past decade that they are faithful to these slogans and persevere in fighting for their realization. This is the secret to Sesoko's ability to gain the support of the Okinawan people, and it is also why the US occupation authorities in Okinawa feel like they have a thorn in their side because of Sesoko's election.

    The US military authorities on Okinawa Island have taken such a crude approach to drive Sesoko out of the Naha City government, which does not indicate that the US military authorities have power, but rather is a manifestation of their fear of the Okinawan people's resistance. At the same time, this will not only fail to erase the deep desire in the hearts of the Okinawan people to oppose the US occupation and maintain independence and freedom, but will only arouse greater anger and resistance among the Okinawan people towards the American aggressors.

    Since occupying Okinawa in 1945, the United States has poured billions of dollars into this island, which is only over two thousand square kilometers in area. The United States is wholeheartedly trying to permanently occupy Okinawa, treating it as an important military base for monitoring Japan and threatening peace in Asia. However, the more the United States intensifies its plunder of the Okinawan people's land and expands its bases, the more unstable the factors of its rule in Okinawa become. An article published in the American "Nation" magazine about a year ago already noted the fact that: "The dissatisfaction of the 800,000 Ryukyu people under US military rule is growing, and the frequent riots and organized protests have become so serious that... some legislators are even considering whether the local people's dissatisfaction will endanger the US military on Okinawa when war breaks out." Indeed, once the anger of the Okinawan people resisting the US military occupation erupts, the American colonialists will see that what is under their feet is not an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" but a live volcano sufficient to bury them.

    濑长被迫去职
    冲绳岛的美国占领当局千方百计地迫使那霸市市长濑长龟次郎去职，反映了美国殖民者对冲绳人民潜藏的反抗情绪的恐惧。
    濑长龟次郎是冲绳岛人民党领袖，他是在去年12月25日当选为那霸市长的。人民党一向站在坚决反对美国军事占领政策的前列，濑长曾为此一再受到美军当局的迫害，并曾被捕入狱近两年之久。美军当局对濑长当选为冲绳首府那霸市市长，当然感到极不愉快，因此一开始就对他施加压力，企图逼他下台。最初美军当局采用冻结那霸市政府在琉球银行的存款的办法，实行经济封锁；随后又企图迫使琉球议会通过反共法案，以便制造赶走濑长的借口；今年6月间，美国操纵那霸市议会曾一度通过了对濑长的不信任案，但是濑长在冲绳人民的支持之下解散了市议会，重新进行选举的结果，支持濑长的进步势力在市议会三十个席位中取得了十二个席位，这就消除了市议会用三分之二的多数票再次通过对他的不信任案的可能性。按照琉球的法律规定，如果市议会两次表示不信任，市长就必须辞职。现在，美军当局竟采取了随意毁法立法的横暴手段，宣布修改琉球群岛的地方自治法和选举法，把过去必须得到三分之二以上议员的赞同才能通过对市长的不信任案的规定，改为只要有二分之一以上的多数即可成立。按照美军当局的这个新规定，那霸市议会终于在11月25日又一次通过了对濑长的“不信任”案。蓄谋已久的赶走濑长的阴谋虽然得逞，美军当局黔驴技穷的窘相却也毕露无遗。法律既然可以用军事当局的一纸命令随便加以改变，还侈谈什么“地方自治”、“民主选举”呢？这实在是天大的讽刺！
    濑长龟次郎能够当选为那霸市长，能够在美军当局和当地反动势力的四面“围剿”和强大压力下，坚持执政将达一年；而且在8月间的选举中能够使议会中支持他的议席增加一倍，只能由一个原因加以说明：这就是冲绳人民对他的拥护和支持。濑长提出的主要竞选口号是：反对美军征用土地扩大军事基地，把冲绳岛归还日本，停止美国对冲绳财政和贸易的军事控制。濑长和他领导的人民党，十多年来以自己的实际行动向人民证明了他们是忠实于这些口号并为其实现而坚持奋斗的。这是濑长能够得到冲绳人民拥护的秘密，也是为什么冲绳的美国占领当局对濑长的当选感到有如芒刺在背的原因。
    冲绳岛的美军当局采取这样粗暴的办法把濑长赶出那霸市政府，并不是表明美国军事当局有力量，而正是它们害怕冲绳岛人民反抗力量的表现。同时这不但不能抹掉印在冲绳人民心头的反对美国占领和维护独立自由的深切愿望，而且只会激起冲绳人民对美国侵略者的更大愤怒和反抗。
    美国自从1945年占领冲绳以来，已经在这个方圆不过两千多平方公里的岛上投下了数以十亿计的美元。美国一心一意想要永久霸占冲绳，把它当成监视日本、威胁亚洲和平的重要军事基地。但是美国越加紧掠夺冲绳人民土地，扩大基地，它在冲绳的统治的不稳定因素也就越发增长。美国“民族”周刊在大约一年前发表的一篇文章已经注意到了这样的事实：“八十万琉球人民在美国的军事统治下不满情绪日益增长，经常发生的暴动和有组织的抗议行动已严重到这样的程度，……有些议员甚至考虑到当战事发生的时候，当地人民的不满是否会危及在冲绳岛的美军”。的确，冲绳岛人民反抗美国军事占领的怒火一旦爆发，美国殖民者就将看到：他们的脚下不是一只“不沉的航空母舰”，而是一座足以葬埋他们的活火山。
