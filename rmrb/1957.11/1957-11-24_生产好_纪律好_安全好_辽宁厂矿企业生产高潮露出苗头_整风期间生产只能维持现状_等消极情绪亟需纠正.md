    Good Production, Good Discipline, Good Safety
    Production Upsurge Emerges in Liaoning Factories and Mines
    Negative Sentiments Such as "Production Can Only Maintain the Status Quo During Rectification" Urgently Need to be Corrected
    (Reported by our correspondent Jin Yukun) A new production upsurge is showing signs of emerging in factories and mines in the Liaoning area during the rectification movement. The leading personnel of many enterprises are actively promoting this developing production upsurge, organizing and guiding the labor enthusiasm aroused by the masses in the rectification movement in a timely manner to production, and striving to overfulfill this year's state plan.
    Since the launch of the rectification movement, a new situation of good production, good discipline, and good safety has emerged successively in factories and mines in the Liaoning area. October was the first month for most enterprises to carry out rectification, and it was also the best month for completing tasks this year. The total output value of state-owned industries in the province exceeded the plan by 6%. In the Fushun Mining Area, almost all coal mines overproduced every day in October. Eighteen of the twenty-four coal mining and tunneling units overfulfilled their tasks, and personal accidents also decreased by 78% compared with the previous month. This mining area initially determined to increase production by 400,000 tons of coal for the whole year. In the first nine months, it only increased production by 270,000 tons, but in October alone, it increased production by 110,000 tons. In the rectification movement, the Anshan Iron and Steel Casting Pipe Plant reversed the situation of failing to complete tasks every month in the past. In October, it produced more than 1,800 tons of products than planned, and the quality also exceeded national requirements. According to statistics from sixty-eight state-owned factories in Shenyang, the employee attendance rate in October reached 94%, the highest attendance rate this year. Before the start of rectification, the employee attendance rate of the Shenyang Screw Factory was 93%, and it increased to 96.3% in October. The phenomena of employees being absent from work without reason, arbitrarily arriving late and leaving early have been greatly reduced in enterprises in various places.
    Faced with this new situation, many enterprises have quickly proposed effective measures to actively welcome and promote the arrival of a production upsurge. Under the leadership of the factory director, the Shenyang Screw Factory organized a special working group to go deep into the workshops to review production capacity, identify weak links and key issues, and conduct comprehensive adjustments and balancing. On this basis, it also formulated a plan to further increase production and save more than one million yuan. Many factories are comprehensively improving production management and strengthening the leadership of labor competitions. The Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant recently proposed a plan to improve production management. This plan requires the equilibrium rate of production to be increased from 85% to 90%, the scrap rate to be reduced by 20% compared with the existing level, and the material utilization rate to be increased by an average of 2%. The factory has also further organized labor competitions and advanced producer movements around the plan to increase production by another 1,206 tons and save one million yuan by the end of the year, and has strengthened the work of rationalization proposals and the promotion of advanced experience. Many enterprises have also rearranged leadership forces. The Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill decided that the factory director, deputy secretary of the Party committee, and chairman of the trade union should be mainly responsible for leading the production upsurge, in order to strengthen this front.
    The current issue that needs attention is that a considerable number of leading personnel in the Liaoning area, although they have also seen the signs of the arrival of a production upsurge, have not taken the initiative to lead and promote this upsurge in a timely manner. They have not correctly understood the policy of ensuring that both rectification and production are not neglected, and mistakenly believe that maintaining the status quo of production during rectification is sufficient. They have not paid attention to using the situation of rectification to promote production. Some people even attempt to postpone the arrival of the upsurge, preparing to free up their hands to organize and lead the production upsurge next year when discussing the national plan. This actually separates the two fronts of rectification and production. This will make it impossible to consolidate and develop the labor enthusiasm aroused by the masses in the rectification movement, and will instead be frustrated. This situation should be changed quickly.

### 生产好　纪律好　安全好  辽宁厂矿企业生产高潮露出苗头  “整风期间生产只能维持现状”等消极情绪亟需纠正

    生产好　纪律好　安全好
    辽宁厂矿企业生产高潮露出苗头
    “整风期间生产只能维持现状”等消极情绪亟需纠正
    本报讯　记者金雨困报道：辽宁地区工矿企业在整风运动中已经出现了新生产高潮到来的苗头。许多企业的领导人员正在积极促进这个正在形成中的生产高潮，把群众在整风运动中激发起来的劳动积极性及时组织和引导到生产上去，争取超额完成今年的国家计划。
    整风运动开展以来，辽宁地区的工矿企业陆续出现了生产好、纪律好、安全好的新局面。10月份是大部企业开展整风的第一个月，也是今年以来完成任务最好的一个月。全省国营工业超额6％完成了总产值计划。抚顺矿区所有煤矿在10月份几乎都日日超产，二十四个采煤和掘进单位有十八个超额完成了任务，人身事故也比上月减少了78％。这个矿区在年初确定全年要增产四十万吨煤，头九个月只增产了二十七万吨，10月份一个月就增产了十一万吨。鞍钢铸管厂在整风运动中扭转了过去月月完不成任务的局面，10月份比计划多产了一千八百多吨产品，质量也超过了国家的要求。据沈阳六十八个国营工厂的统计，10月份职工出勤率达到94％，为今年以来出勤率最高的一个月。沈阳螺钉厂整风开始以前职工出勤率为93％，10月份提高到96．3％。各地企业中职工无故旷工、随意迟到早退等现象大为减少。
    面对着这种新局面，不少企业迅速提出了有效措施，积极迎接和促进生产高潮的到来。沈阳螺钉厂在厂长领导下组织了专门工作组，深入车间复查生产能力，找出薄弱环节和关键问题，进行全面的调整和平衡，并且在这个基础上制订了再增产节约百余万元的方案。许多工厂正在全面改进生产管理工作，加强劳动竞赛的领导。沈阳矿山机器厂最近提出了改进生产管理的方案。这个方案要求生产的均衡率由85％提高到90％，废品率比现有水平降低20％，材料利用率平均提高2％。这个厂还围绕着到年底再增产一千二百零六吨，节约百万元的计划，进一步组织劳动竞赛和先进生产者运动，并且加强了合理化建议和推广先进经验的工作。不少企业还重新安排了领导力量。鞍钢第一初轧厂就决定厂长、党委副书记和工会主席主要负责生产高潮的领导，以加强这一战线。
    当前需要注意的问题是：辽宁地区还有相当多的企业的领导人员，虽也看到了生产高潮到来的苗头，却没有及时主动地去领导和推进这个高潮。他们没有正确地理解整风和生产两不误的方针，误认为整风期间仅仅能维持生产现状就可以，而没有注意利用整风的形势去推动生产。有的人甚至企图推迟高潮的到来，准备到明年讨论国家计划的时候再腾出手来组织和领导生产高潮。这样实际上是把整风和生产两条战线截然分开。这会使群众在整风运动中激发起来的劳动热情无法巩固和发展，反而会受到挫伤。这种情况应该迅速改变。
