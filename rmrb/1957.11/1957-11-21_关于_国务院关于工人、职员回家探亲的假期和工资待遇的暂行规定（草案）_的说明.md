Explanation of the "Provisional Regulations (Draft) of the State Council Regarding Vacation and Wage Treatment for Workers and Staff Returning Home to Visit Relatives"
Minister of Labor, Ma Wenrui

    Among the more than 24 million workers and staff nationwide, it is estimated that about 6 million live separately from their families. Since the annual leave system for workers and staff has not yet been implemented, many workers and staff feel they lack opportunities to reunite with their families. Some workers and staff have requested that the administrative side resolve the issue of family dormitories; many workers and staff return home during the Spring Festival, which affects the reduction of attendance rates before and after the Spring Festival holiday and the congestion of transportation; many workers and staff family members constantly come to the city to visit their husbands and children, which also increases the difficulties of urban supply and administrative management of various units. Some departments, in order to appropriately solve this problem, have already stipulated some methods for returning home to visit relatives, for example, the Ministry of Construction, Geology, Petroleum, and Electricity have stipulated 15 days or one month of vacation per year for capital construction exploration personnel; Beijing's commercial enterprises have changed the weekly day off to one day off every two weeks, leaving 26 public holidays to be used centrally for returning home to visit relatives. However, the length of vacations stipulated separately by various departments varies, and the subsidies for transportation expenses also vary, and since most departments' workers and staff do not yet have this treatment, it appears that the treatment between various departments is inconsistent.
    In order to appropriately meet the requirements of workers and staff who live separately from their families to return home to visit relatives, encourage workers and staff to avoid or reduce bringing their families with them, encourage family members of workers and staff who have already come to the city to return to their hometowns for production, reduce the burden on urban housing, transportation, and consumer goods supply, and arrange the time for workers and staff to return home to visit relatives in a planned way to ensure that enterprise attendance rates are normal before and after holidays such as the Spring Festival, and to avoid inconsistent treatment between various departments, it is now necessary to first formulate a nationally unified method for granting leave to workers and staff returning home to visit relatives in order to solve the current existing problems, and then further transition to establishing a more complete annual leave system in the future.
    This regulation is formulated based on the principle of both appropriately solving problems and conforming to streamlining and economizing (not increasing personnel, not spending more money). Therefore, for whom it is necessary to give leave and for whom it is not necessary to give leave is a question that should be considered first. The scope of workers and staff who can enjoy the vacation benefits for returning home to visit relatives in this regulation is relatively strict. Article 3 stipulates that returning home to visit relatives is limited to visiting fathers, mothers, and spouses; it also stipulates that, except for workers and staff who live closer to home and can reunite with their parents and spouses by taking advantage of public holidays (referring to the day off each week) and workers and staff who enjoy other paid continuous vacations of more than two weeks each year, they will no longer enjoy the benefits of this regulation. In addition, for other workers and staff, if one of their fathers, mothers, or spouses already lives with them at their work location, they will also not be able to enjoy the benefits of this regulation. This is because what this regulation wants to take care of first and foremost is to enable couples who live separately to have the opportunity to reunite. According to the general situation, workers and staff with spouses, if they bring their families, usually bring their spouses first, and rarely have only their parents living with them without bringing their spouses. Therefore, it can be stipulated that workers and staff who have already brought their families will not be given vacation for returning home to visit relatives. Some people feel that if workers and staff already have spouses living with them at their work location, but their parents are still in other places, it seems a bit inhumane not to give them vacation to visit them. Of course, parents should be visited. This regulation has already given this kind of vacation to workers and staff who are single at their work location. However, if vacation is given to all workers and staff who have spouses living with them but whose parents are in other places, because there are many such situations, it will inevitably greatly increase the number of people who need to be given vacation, which will increase the state's expenditure, and even some departments will have to increase their staffing, which is difficult for the country's current economic conditions to afford. Moreover, giving vacation to workers and staff with family members will appear unfair compared to workers and staff without family members. We should be realistic, act according to our capabilities, and only solve the most urgent problems that need to be solved at present. When a formal annual leave system is implemented in the future, this problem can be better solved. This can be fully explained to workers and staff and their parents.
    The length of the vacation is related to whether it is necessary to increase staffing. The stipulated vacation is two to three weeks per person per year; because vacation cannot be given in the current year due to work needs and those who live too far from home (more than ten days round trip) can be given vacation once every two years, the former is four to five weeks, and the latter is five to six weeks. If we calculate an average of two and a half weeks of vacation per person per year, giving vacation to all six million workers and staff is equivalent to 340,000 people being on vacation for one year. Assuming that the current staffing of each department is just right, then when implementing this regulation, the country will need to increase staff by 340,000. However, the current actual situation is that there are a large number of surplus personnel in each department, and the number of surplus personnel nationwide is far more than 300,000. Therefore, when implementing this regulation, in addition to some departments not needing to increase personnel at all, some departments only need to make appropriate internal adjustments to completely achieve not increasing the total number of personnel. This is also stipulated in Article 6.
    Article 4 stipulates that workers and staff should be paid wages according to their hourly wage standard during their vacation for returning home to visit relatives, which is necessary. From the perspective of state expenditure, giving wages during vacation compared to the past when some departments treated workers and staff returning home as personal leave and did not pay wages, more money is being spent. However, because the number of personnel is not increased, the total wage amount will not increase. Article 5 stipulates that if the round-trip transportation expenses for returning home exceed one-half of the employee's monthly wage standard, the administrative side will subsidize one-half of the excess. This item requires the state to spend more money. However, calculating the overall account, this is still much more economical than family members coming to the city to live. Some comrades advocate that transportation expenses should be borne by the workers and staff themselves. We believe that in order to take care of workers and staff who live far away and have low incomes, it is still necessary to subsidize a portion. Some comrades also believe that the transportation subsidy standard is too low and advocate for further increasing it. We believe that subsidizing according to the prescribed standard can already solve the problem, and considering the state's financial strength and conservation, further subsidizing is also inappropriate.

    关于“国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定（草案）”的说明
    劳动部部长　马文瑞
    在全国二千四百多万职工中，据估算约有六百多万人同家属分住在两地。由于目前还没有实行职工的年休假制度，因而不少职工感到缺少同家人团聚的机会。有的职工就要求行政方面解决家属宿舍问题；许多职工都在春节回家，影响春节假期前后的出勤率降低和交通的拥挤；不少职工家属不断进城探望丈夫子女，也增加了城市供应和各单位行政管理的困难。有的部门为了适当地解决这个问题，已经规定了一些回家探亲的办法，例如建筑、地质、石油、电力等部为基建勘探人员规定了每年十五日或者一个月的假期；北京市商业企业把每周休假一日改为每两周休假一日，留下二十六个公共休假日集中用于回家探亲。但是，各部门分别规定的假期有长有短，车船费的补助也有高有低，加之多数部门的职工还没有这种待遇，所以显得各部门之间待遇不一致。
    为了适当地满足同家属分住在两地的职工回家探亲的要求，鼓励职工尽量不带或少带家属，鼓励已经进城的职工家属回乡生产，减轻城市住房、交通、消费品供应等方面的负担，和有计划地安排职工回家探亲的时间，保证企业在春节等假期前后出勤率正常，以及避免各部门之间待遇不一致，现在有必要先制定一个全国统一实行的职工回家探亲给假的办法，以解决当前存在的问题，然后在将来进一步过渡到建立更完善的年休假制度。
    这个规定，是根据既要适当解决问题，又要符合精简节约（不增加人，不多花钱）的原则制定的。因此，对于那些人需要给假，那些人不需要给假，是应该首先考虑的一个问题。这个规定中对于可以享受回家探亲假期待遇的职工的范围，限制是比较严的。第三条规定，回家探亲只限于探望父亲、母亲和配偶；还规定，除了离家较近、能够利用公共休假日（指每周休息一天的休假日）同父母、配偶团聚的职工和每年享有其他领取工资的连续两个星期以上的假期的职工，都不再享受本规定的待遇而外，对于其他职工，凡是在本人工作地点已经有父亲、母亲或者配偶一人同住的，也都不能享受本规定的待遇。这是因为这个规定所要照顾的，首先是使分住两地的夫妇能够有机会团聚。按照一般情况，有配偶的职工如果携带家属，通常是先携带配偶，很少只有父母同住而却没有携带配偶的。因此，对于已经带有家属的职工，可以规定不给回家探亲假期。有人觉得，如果职工在工作地点已经有配偶同住，但是父母仍在外地，不给他们假期前往探望，似乎有些不近人情。诚然，父母是应该探望的。这个规定中对于单身在工作地点的职工，已经给予了这种假期。但是如果要对于已经携带有配偶同住而父母在外地的职工也一律给假，因为这种情况很多，就势必要大大增多需要给假的人数，会加大国家开支，甚至有的部门要增加人员编制，这是国家当前的经济条件所难以办到的。并且，对于带家眷的职工也给假的话，这同没有带家眷的职工比较起来，待遇也会是显得不公平的。我们实事求是，量力而行，就只能首先解决当前最迫切需要解决的问题。等到日后实行了正式的年休假制度，这个问题就可以得到更好的解决。这是完全可以向职工以及他们的父母讲清楚的。
    假期的长短，关系到是否需要增加人员编制。规定的假期是每人每年两个星期至三个星期；因为工作需要当年不能给假的以及离家太远（往返十天以上）的，都可以两年给假一次，前者是四个星期至五个星期，后者是五个星期至六个星期。如果平均以每人每年给假两个半星期计算，六百万职工统统给假的话，约等于三十四万人放假一年。假定目前各部门的定员编制都正好恰当，那么，实行这个规定的时候，全国就需要增加职工三十四万人。但是，现在的实际情况各部门都有大量人员多余，全国多余的人员远不止三十多万。因此，实行这个规定时，除了有些部门根本不需要增加人员以外，有些部门也只需经过内部适当调剂，就完全可以做到不增加总的人员编制。对于这个问题，第六条中也有规定。
    第四条规定，职工回家探亲假期一律按照本人计时工资标准发给工资，这是必要的。从国家开支方面说，假期照发工资与过去有些部门职工回家按照事假处理不发工资比较，是多花了钱。但是，由于人员编制不增加，因而工资总额是不会增加的。第五条规定，回家往返的车船费如果超过本人月工资标准的二分之一，就由行政方面补助超过部分的二分之一。这一项，是需要国家多开支一些钱的。但是算一下大账，这样还是比家属进城来住节约得多。有的同志主张车船费应该由职工自理。我们认为为了照顾路远的和收入低的职工，补助一部分还是需要的。也有同志认为车船费补助标准低了，主张再提高一些。我们认为按规定的标准补助，已经可以解决问题了，并且从国家财政力量和节约考虑，再多补助也是不适当的。
