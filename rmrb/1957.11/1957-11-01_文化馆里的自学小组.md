This newspaper reports: The Qianmen District Cultural Center in Beijing, following the requests of junior middle school graduates who did not continue their education this summer, actively organized them to listen to the "Beijing Youth Self-Study Guidance Broadcast Lectures." Since September 18th, a total of forty people have been coming to the cultural center to listen, forming a self-study group.

The "Youth Self-Study Guidance Broadcast Lectures" are broadcast from 8:30 AM to 10:20 AM from Monday to Friday. The people in the self-study group listen on time and have gained a lot. Meng Zhaoshi's confidence in self-study has greatly increased after this period of learning. He said, "The knowledge that can be learned in school can also be learned through self-study. The key lies in one's own efforts."

In order to better help young people study on their own, the cultural center is preparing to group the participants according to their different employment and education requirements to facilitate discussions. It is also preparing to hire middle school teachers to provide classroom tutoring and solve difficult problems encountered during learning.

The cultural center also pays attention to the political and ideological education and labor education of young people who are studying on their own. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the cultural center organized reports by Wang Hongxun and Ji Xiushan, veteran Chinese soldiers who personally participated in the October Revolution struggle, and notified the self-study youth to participate. It is also preparing to contact the district Communist Youth League committee to organize reports on socialist ideological education. In terms of labor, it is actively planning to arrange for them to visit factories and agricultural cooperatives and participate in voluntary labor.

In terms of cultural life, the cultural center also strives to meet the needs of young people who are studying on their own. Some people have already been absorbed into the performance activities held by the center, and it is also preparing to organize literature research groups and art groups for them.

    文化馆里的自学小组
    本报讯　北京市前门区文化馆在今年暑假以后，根据没有升学的初中毕业生的要求，积极组织他们收听“北京市青年自学辅导广播讲座”。从9月18日开始到现在，到文化馆收听的共有四十人，组织了一个自学小组。
    “青年自学辅导广播讲座”在每星期一至星期五上午八时半到十时二十分播音，自学小组的人都按时收听，收获很大。孟昭湜经过这一期间学习后，自学的信心大大加强。他说：“在学校可以学得到的知识，自学也可以学得到，关键在于自己努力。”
    为了更好地帮助青年自学，文化馆根据每个人就业和就学的不同要求，正准备把参加自学的人分别编组，以便组织讨论；还准备聘请中学老师进行课堂辅导，解决学习中的疑难问题。
    对于自学青年的政治思想教育和劳动教育，文化馆也很注意。为庆祝十月革命四十周年，文化馆组织了亲身参加过十月革命斗争的中国老战士王鸿勋、季秀山的报告会，都通知自学青年参加；还准备和区共青团委联系，组织有关社会主义思想教育等报告会。在劳动方面，正积极计划安排他们参观访问工厂、农业社，参加义务劳动。
    在文化生活方面，文化馆也尽力满足自学青年的要求。有些人已被吸收参加馆内所举办的演出活动，还准备为他们组织文学研究小组和美术小组。
