Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Jiangxi Province currently has 350,000 farmers at water conservancy construction sites, with crowds of people building water conservancy projects and vehicles and boats transporting materials everywhere.

    The mass upsurge in water conservancy construction in Jiangxi this year is higher than in any previous year, and the start time is one and a half months earlier than in previous years. Seven hundred key projects have already started, and other projects are being intensified for survey and design, preparing for construction. Nanchang Prefecture launched a "Hundred-Day Winter Repair Campaign" and aims to bring the movement to a climax through competition. Most of the 25,000 small-scale water conservancy projects have already started. At the Yuanhui Canal construction site in this prefecture, 30,000 farmers are building channels every day. From morning till night, the sounds of chiseling stones and explosions are constant on the construction site. One hundred and sixty light boats navigate the Yuan River day and night, transporting large quantities of sand, stone, steel bars, cement, and other materials to the construction site. On the two fifty-li-long canals of the Xingfu Reservoir in Shangrao Prefecture, 15,000 people are carrying soil and digging stones. More than 500 cadres and more than 100,000 farmers in this prefecture have entered water conservancy construction sites, and various materials are being transported to the construction sites in earnest. In Ji'an Prefecture, which is threatened by drought every year, more than 100,000 farmers are working on more than 100 water conservancy construction sites every day. Zhu Jixian, Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, personally went to the construction sites to inspect and guide the construction work.

    Jiangxi Province originally planned to expand the irrigated area by 1.7 million mu this winter and spring. After the start of winter repairs, the masses in various places enthusiastically carried out activities to raise water conservancy funds themselves and actively demanded to expand the area of water conservancy construction. In the Gannan Administrative Region, the irrigated area increased from 250,000 mu to 400,000 mu because the masses solved the funding problem themselves. Ji'an Prefecture also decided to expand the irrigated area by another 100,000 mu on the basis of the original plan. The province's plan to expand the irrigated area has increased to 2.5 million mu.

    江西七百处重点工程开工
    全省计划扩大灌溉面积二百五十万亩
    新华社讯　江西省目前已有三十五万农民到达水利工地，到处都是兴修水利的人群和运送器材的车马船只。
    江西今年群众兴修水利的热潮比以往任何一年都高，动工时间比往年提早一个半月。现在已经开工的重点工程达七百座，其他的工程正在加紧勘察设计，准备施工。南昌专区展开了“百日冬修运动”，并要在竞赛中使运动达到高潮，现在二万五千座小型水利工程大部分已经开工。这个专区袁惠渠工地，每天有三万农民修筑渠道，从晨到暮，工地上的凿石声、放炮声此起彼伏，一百六十条轻便船只在袁水上日夜航行，把大量的沙、石、钢筋、水泥等源源不断地运送到工地上。在上饶专区幸福水库的两条五十里长的渠道上，有一万五千人在挑土，挖石，这个专区现在已有五百多名干部和十多万农民进入水利工地，各种器材正在紧张地运向施工地点。年年受干旱威胁的吉安专区，每天有十万多农民在一百多个水利工地上劳动，地委书记朱继先亲自到工地上检查和指导兴修工作。
    江西省原计划今冬明春扩大灌溉面积一百七十万亩。冬修动工后，各地群众热烈地开展自筹水利经费活动，积极要求扩大兴修水利面积。赣南行政区由于群众自己解决了经费问题，灌溉面积由二十五万亩增加到四十万亩。吉安专区也决定在原计划的基础上再扩大灌溉面积十万亩。全省扩大灌溉面积计划已增加到二百五十万亩。
