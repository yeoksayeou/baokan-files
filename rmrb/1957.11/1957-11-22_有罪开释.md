	Acquittal
		Chi Bei'ou
	American soldiers treat Japanese lives like child's play,
	But Japanese judges acquit the murderers.
	It is confirmed that there are no other circumstances,
	It is because allies must be treated politely.
	It is well known that the United States and Japan are allies,
	Like husband and wife. (Note)
	The collective defense of the two countries is crucial,
	The common security of both parties is at stake.
	What's mine is yours,
	The Stars and Stripes can replace the Rising Sun Flag.
	The American masters accidentally fired their guns in a moment of joy,
	The Japanese commoners can only accept their bad luck.
	Please be more inclusive and don't mind it,
	Since so much beautiful land is willing to be given away,
	Why care about a village woman, Sakae Nakako?
	But Prime Minister Kishi, shouldn't you first find out
	Whether the Japanese people will allow you to do such an outrageous thing.
	Note: U.S. Ambassador to Japan MacArthur II once said: "The relationship between the United States and Japan is like a married couple."

    有罪开释	池北偶
    美国兵把日本人命当儿戏，
    日本法官却把杀人犯有罪开释。
    查实此中并无别情，
    乃因对待盟友要客气。
    众所周知美国日本是盟邦，
    有如丈夫和妻子。（注）
    两国集体防御攸关，
    双方共同安全所系。
    我的就是你的，
    星条旗可以代替太阳旗。
    美国大人一时高兴乱开枪，
    日本小民只好认霉气。
    请多包含，不必介意，
    既然多少大好河山都舍得，
    何必在乎一个村妇坂井奈加子？
    但是岸首相阁下也不先打听打听
    日本人民是否容许你们干出这等丑事。
    注：美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二曾说过：“美日关系如夫妇”。
