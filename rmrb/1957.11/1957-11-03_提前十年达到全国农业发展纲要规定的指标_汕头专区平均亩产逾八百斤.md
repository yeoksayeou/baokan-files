Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 2nd (Xinhua News Agency reporter He Xing): The seventeen counties and cities of Shantou Prefecture, Guangdong Province, have reached the target set by the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft) of an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu, ten years ahead of schedule. The late rice harvest has already begun in the area. According to estimates by local agricultural departments, although some late rice crops suffered significant reductions due to severe flooding and typhoons, the prefecture's 4,290,000 mu of late rice will still increase production by more than 61 million jin compared to last year, with an average yield of 411 jin per mu. Including early rice and other grain crops, the prefecture's more than 5 million mu of grain crops will have an average annual yield of approximately 810 jin per mu this year.

Shantou Prefecture consists of seventeen counties and cities, among which the six counties in the Chaoshan Plain have an average grain yield exceeding 1,000 jin per mu this year. Chao'an County, which has maintained the honorary title of "1,000-jin county" for three consecutive years, has an average yield of more than 1,020 jin per mu on its 300,000+ mu of double-cropping rice this year. Adding sweet potatoes and wheat, the yield will reach 1,096 jin per mu. Chenghai County has also increased production this year and has become a "1,000-jin rice county" for three consecutive years. Jieyang, Puning, Chaoyang, and Nan'ao counties, which were already "1,000-jin grain counties" last year, have also achieved an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu this year. Among them, Jieyang County's 800,000 mu of grain crops have an average yield of more than 1,065 jin per mu, an increase of more than 30 jin compared to last year. Three agricultural cooperatives in the Chaoshan Plain area have also set a high-yield record of over 2,000 jin per mu of double-cropping rice.

The unit area yield in these six counties of the Chaoshan Plain is, on average, about 80% higher than the normal yield before liberation.

Shantou Prefecture is backed by mountains and faces the sea, and production has always been severely threatened by water and drought disasters. In recent years, especially since the realization of agricultural cooperation, the local Party and government leadership organs have actively mobilized the masses and relied on their strength to fight against natural disasters, and have comprehensively carried out production construction and technological reforms. Therefore, on the basis of ensuring a relatively stable production situation, grain production has been rapidly increased. For example, as a result of vigorously building water conservancy projects, 85% of the region's paddy fields now have drought resistance capacity of 30 to 60 days or more. The more than 900 kilometers of flood control dikes along several rivers have been basically built to ensure that ordinary floods do not breach. In the Chaoshan Plain area, in addition to applying 20 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu of double-cropping rice, the fertilizer problem is basically solved by relying on the masses to accumulate manure. Farmers in Chao'an County have accumulated an average of more than 10,000 jin of native miscellaneous fertilizer per mu of land in the past two years.

Luo Tian, First Secretary of the CPC Shantou Prefectural Committee, told reporters that the grain yield in the counties of the entire prefecture is still very uneven. For example, in fifteen counties, the yields of eight counties are still low, with an average yield of less than 800 jin per mu. Within the six "1,000-jin counties," there are also areas with relatively low yields. This shows that there is still great production potential in these areas. Recently, the CPC Shantou Prefectural Committee and the Shantou Prefectural Commissioner's Office have, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee, preliminarily formulated a ten-year grain production development plan for the future, and decided to take measures to increase the average grain yield per mu in the entire prefecture to 1,000 jin by 1962, and to 1,100 jin by 1967. Luo Tian believes that as long as all cadres resolutely mobilize the masses to strengthen leadership, this plan is certain to be realized.

### 提前十年达到全国农业发展纲要规定的指标  汕头专区平均亩产逾八百斤

    提前十年达到全国农业发展纲要规定的指标
    汕头专区平均亩产逾八百斤
    新华社广州2日电　新华社记者河星报道：广东省汕头专区十七个县、市，已经提前十年实现农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定平均每亩粮食产量达到八百斤的要求。现在这个地区的晚稻已经开镰，据当地农业部门的估计，今年虽然有一部分晚稻受到严重水灾和风灾，稍有减产，但全专区四百二十九万多亩晚稻仍然将比去年增产六千一百多万斤，平均每亩产量可以达到四百一十一斤。加上早稻和其他粮食作物，全专区五百多万亩粮食作物，今年全年平均每亩产量将达到八百一十斤左右。
    汕头专区共有十七个县、市，其中潮汕平原的六个县，今年平均每亩粮食产量都已超过一千斤。已连续三年保持水稻“千斤县”光荣称号的潮安县，三十多万亩双季稻今年平均每亩可达一千零二十多斤，加上地瓜和小麦等，每亩产量将达到一千零九十六斤。澄海县今年也获得增产，成为连续三年的水稻“千斤县”。去年就已经成为粮食“千斤县”的揭阳、普宁、潮阳、南澳等四个县，今年平均每亩产量也都达到一千斤，其中揭阳县八十万亩粮食作物平均每亩产量在一千零六十五斤以上，比去年增产三十多斤，潮汕平原地区有三个农业社并创造了一亩双季稻超过二千斤的高产纪录。
    潮汕平原这六个县的单位面积产量，平均约超过解放前正常年产量的80％。
    汕头专区背山面海，生产上一向受到水、旱灾害的严重威胁。几年来，特别自从实现农业合作化以后，当地的党政领导机关积极发动群众和依靠群众的力量，同自然灾害作斗争，全面展开生产建设和技术改革，因此在保证比较稳定的生产局面的基础上，迅速提高了粮食产量。例如由于大力兴修水利的结果，全区已有85％的水田抗旱能力达到三十到六十多天；沿几条江的共九百多公里长的防洪堤，已基本做到保证普通的洪水不溃决。潮汕平原地区今年除每亩双季稻施用二十斤化学肥料外，肥料问题基本上是依靠群众的积肥来解决的。潮安县农民积的土杂肥，两年来平均每亩田都在一万斤以上。
    中共汕头地委第一书记罗天对记者说，现在全专区各县的粮食产量还是很不平衡，例如在十五个县中还有八个县的产量较低，平均每亩产量没有达到八百斤。在六个“千斤县”内，也有一部分地区的产量比较低。这就说明了目前这些地区还有很大的生产潜力。最近中共汕头地委和汕头专署已经根据中共八届三中全会精神，初步拟定了今后十年的粮食生产发展规划，决定采取措施，到1962年时，使全专区平均每亩粮食产量达到一千斤，到1967年时达到一千一百斤。罗天认为，只要全体干部能坚决发动群众加强领导，这个计划是有把握实现的。
