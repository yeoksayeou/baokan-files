Wind in the Pines

Celebrating the Fortieth Anniversary of the October Revolution

Deng Sanmu

With a single lift, the red flag swept away the long whale,
Celebrating the success of October,
Forty years of achievement like a swift wheel,
A clever strategy that makes Europe and America tremble.
The ground troops send missiles,
Adding a planet to the distant sky.
The common people of China worship the pioneer,
Is it just like brothers?
Endless technology selflessly assists,
The kindness is deeper than the pool water.
Hand in hand, striding forward like flying,
Holding high the torch of peace.

    风入松
    庆祝十月革命四十周年
    邓散木
    红旗一举扫长鲸，十月庆功成，卌年业绩飚轮迅，奇谋使欧美心惊。地面送将导弹，遥空添个行星。中华黎庶拜先声，岂只弟和兄？无穷技术无私助，恩情比潭水还深。携手如飞迈进，和平火炬高擎。
