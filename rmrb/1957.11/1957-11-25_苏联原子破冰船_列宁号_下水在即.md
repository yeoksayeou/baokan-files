Xinhua News Agency, November 24th - According to TASS: The scaffolding around the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker, the "Lenin," has been removed, and the launch date is approaching.

Tests on the hull and various equipment of the icebreaker have been completed. Currently, work is underway to install the propeller shafts and propellers on the icebreaker.

Due to the enormous weight of the icebreaker when launched, special pontoons will be installed at the bow and stern. Complex launching equipment is being manufactured.

On the "Lenin" nuclear-powered icebreaker, the crew members are accommodated in single or double cabins, with no collective dormitories. It is understood that this icebreaker can continuously navigate the ocean for four hundred days without docking at a port.
