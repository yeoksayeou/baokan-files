Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th: The Anhui Province held a provincial conference of manure accumulation activists from the 12th to the 17th. The manure accumulation activists who attended the meeting summarized this year's manure accumulation achievements, exchanged manure accumulation experiences, and expressed their determination to lead farmers throughout the province in launching a vigorous manure accumulation campaign involving thousands of carts and tens of thousands of loads. From now until the end of the autumn planting next year, the province plans to accumulate 11 billion *dan* of manure, an increase of more than half compared to this year's manure accumulation quantity.

The meeting reviewed the province's manure accumulation work this year and unanimously agreed that great achievements had been made. From November of last year to the end of October this year, the province accumulated a total of 6.9 billion *dan* of various fertilizers, exceeding the original plan by 27.7%. Due to the increase in the quantity of accumulated manure, the fertilizer application rate per unit area in the province has increased from 1,000 *jin* in 1953 to 4,600 *jin*, and the fertilizer application area has increased from 50% in 1953 to over 70%. This year, Anhui Province's total grain output is expected to reach 24 billion *jin*, an increase of about 1 billion *jin* compared to the bumper harvest year of 1955, and increased fertilizer application is one of the important reasons. The meeting also pointed out that although Anhui's manure accumulation work this year has achieved great results, it still cannot meet the needs of agricultural production. In order to complete next year's manure accumulation tasks, the meeting believes that it is first necessary to criticize conservative thinking and complacency in the manure accumulation movement, strengthen leadership over the manure accumulation movement, and have dedicated agencies and personnel responsible for leading the manure accumulation work from the special district to the agricultural cooperative, formulate annual and longer-term manure accumulation plans; rationally adjust fertilizer rewards, correct the phenomenon of excessively high or low fertilizer prices; and find fertilizer sources from multiple aspects, plant more green manure, raise pigs, and collect human and animal manure.

The 380 manure accumulation activists and agricultural department cadres who attended the meeting extensively exchanged experiences in manure accumulation, preservation, and application. Fifty-seven people spoke at the general meeting.

    安徽积肥积极分子会议
    计划全省积肥一百一十亿斤
    新华社合肥20日电　安徽省在12日到17日召开了全省积肥积极分子会议。参加会议的积肥积极分子在会上总结了今年的积肥成绩，交流了积肥经验，表示决心带动全省农民开展一个轰轰烈烈的千车万担的积肥运动，从现在起到明年秋种结束止，计划全省积肥一百一十亿担，比今年积肥数量增多一半以上。
    会议对今年全省的积肥工作进行了检查，一致认为今年积肥工作取得了很大的成绩。从去年11月起到今年10月底止，全省共积各种肥料六十九亿担，超出原订计划27．7％。由于积肥数量的增加，全省单位面积施肥量已由1953年的一千斤提高到四千六百斤，施肥面积已由1953年的50％增加到70％以上。今年安徽省的粮食总产量预计可达到二百四十亿斤，比大丰收的1955年增产约十亿斤，多施肥料是重要的原因之一。会议同时指出，安徽今年的积肥工作，虽然取得了很大的成绩，但是还不能满足农业生产的需要。为了完成明年的积肥任务，会议认为首先要批判积肥运动中的保守思想和自满情绪，加强对积肥运动的领导，从专区到农业社都要有专管机构和专人负责领导积肥工作，制订全年和更长远的积肥规划；合理的调整肥料报酬，纠正肥价偏高偏低的现象；从多方面寻找肥源，多种绿肥，养猪和积攒人畜粪尿等。
    到会的三百八十个积肥积极分子和农业部门的干部广泛地交流了积肥、保肥和施肥的经验，有五十七人在大会上发了言。
