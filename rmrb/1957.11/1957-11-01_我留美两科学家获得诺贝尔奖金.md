　　Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 31st—It was announced in a communique published today by the Swedish Academy of Sciences that Chinese physicists Lee Tsung-dao and Yang Chen-ning, who are studying in the United States, have jointly won this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics.
　　The communique stated that Lee Tsung-dao and Yang Chen-ning were awarded the Nobel Prize for their exquisite research on the "Law of Conservation of Parity," which led to important discoveries in the field of elementary particles.
　　When these two Chinese physicists were conducting theoretical research on atomic nuclei and elementary particles last summer, they put forward a new concept that shook the "Law of Conservation of Parity," a fundamental physical law in the microscopic world that had been considered valid for more than thirty years. This concept was soon confirmed experimentally by another Chinese scientist, Wu Chien-hsiung.

    我留美两科学家获得诺贝尔奖金
    新华社31日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：我国留学美国的物理学家李政道和杨振宇共同获得了今年的诺贝尔物理学奖金。这是瑞典科学院31日发表的公报中宣布的。
    公报说，李政道和杨振宇获得诺贝尔奖金，是由于他们对“宇称守恒定律”作了精湛的研究，从而导致基本粒子方面的重要发现。
    我国的这两位物理学家在去年夏天进行原子核和基本粒子理论研究的时候，提出了一个新的观念，动摇了三十多年来一直被认为是微观世界的一个基本物理定律——“宇称守恒定律”，不久这个观念就为我国另一位科学家吴健雄在实验中证实。
