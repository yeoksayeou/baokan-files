    Investigative Work Should Have a Beginning, End, and Results
    Going on business trips should have a purpose, and upon return, there must be reports, research, and decisions made to guide the work. However, as far as I know, some organizations within our ministry and bureau conduct investigative work that has a beginning but no end, fizzling out without truly achieving the purpose of investigating and understanding the work. Let me cite two or three examples:
    At the beginning of 1956, as the Spring Festival approached, Director Jiang of the General Office of the Ministry instructed that personnel be drawn from various bureaus to organize a "Spring Festival Rural Culture Investigation," led by Comrade Li Mu, a group of ten people traveled around Hubei and Jiangsu. However, after returning, the ministry neither listened carefully to the report nor conducted any research, and this investigation ended without any results.
    In the second half of 1956, the ministry organized another "Ethnic Minority Region Culture Investigation." Comrade Li Junwei from our bureau participated in the investigation in Xinjiang. After returning, the bureau leaders did not listen to his report carefully, nor did they use his investigative materials as a basis for researching, guiding, and developing film work in ethnic minority regions.
    I am not against going on business trips; on the contrary, I request more opportunities to go deep into the grassroots and do more investigative work; but it should have a beginning, an end, and results!

    调查工作应有始有终有效果
    出差要有目的，回来必须汇报、研究、做出决定，用来指导工作。但据我所知，我们部和局有些组织调查工作，却是有头无尾，不了了之，没有真正达到调查了解工作的作用。试举二、三例：
    1956年初，将届春节，部办公厅蒋主任指示从各局抽调人员，组织“春节农村文化调查”，由李牧同志带队，一行十人到湖北、江苏转了一圈。但回来后部里既没有很好听取汇报，更没有进行研究，这个调查就不了了之。
    1956年下半年，部里又组织了一次“民族地区文化调查”。我局李君维同志参加到新疆去调查。回来后，局的领导上也没有很好地听他汇报，利用他的调查材料来作为研究、指导和开展民族地区的电影工作。
    我并不反对出差，相反地我要求更多机会深入基层，多做调查工作；但应该有始、有终、有效果！
