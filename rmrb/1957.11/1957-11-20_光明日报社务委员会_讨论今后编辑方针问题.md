Xinhua News Agency, November 18th: The Guangming Daily Editorial Board held a meeting on the afternoon of the 18th, presided over by President Yang Mingxuan, to discuss the future editorial policy of Guangming Daily.

The meeting began with Deputy President and Editor-in-Chief Chen Cisheng giving a concise explanation of the "Guangming Daily Editorial Policy (Draft)." This was followed by a discussion, and the policy was unanimously approved in principle. The members of the Editorial Board unanimously agreed that the democratic parties should strengthen their concern and support for this newspaper in the future, so that it can become a powerful weapon for implementing the policies and guidelines of the Communist Party and the People's Government, publicizing the achievements of socialist transformation and socialist construction, especially in cultural and educational undertakings, conducting socialist education for members of democratic parties and intellectuals, and helping them carry out self-reform. Furthermore, the lesson should be drawn from the fact that Guangming Daily's political direction was once tampered with by rightists Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping, and further efforts should be made to win the leadership of the Communist Party, strengthen ties with intellectual circles, and run this socialist newspaper well.

Editorial Board members attending the meeting included Wang Kunlun, Sa Kongliao, Sun Xiaocun (represented by Zi Yaohua), Yang Dongchun (represented by Wu Rong), Yan Xinmin, Yan Xichun, Sun Chengpei, Li Chunqing (represented by Ma Zaiguang), and others.

Wang Mo, Deputy Director of the Press and Publication Bureau of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, was also invited to attend the meeting.

    光明日报社务委员会
    讨论今后编辑方针问题
    新华社18日讯　光明日报社务委员会于18日下午在社长杨明轩主持下举行会议，讨论光明日报今后编辑方针问题。
    会议首先由副社长兼总编辑陈此生对于“光明日报编辑方针（草案）”作了扼要的说明，随即进行讨论，并一致决定原则通过这个方针。社务委员们一致认为，各民主党派今后应加强对于这张报纸的关心和支持，使它成为贯彻共产党和人民政府的方针政策，宣传社会主义改造与社会主义建设，特别是文教事业的成就，对民主党派成员和知识分子进行社会主义教育，帮助他们进行自我改造的有力武器；并且应当吸取光明日报一度被右派分子章伯钧、储安平篡改了政治方向的教训，进一步争取共产党的领导，密切同知识界的联系，办好这张社会主义的报纸。
    出席会议的社务委员有王昆仑、萨空了、孙晓村（资耀华代）、杨东莼（吴荣代）、严信民、严希纯、孙承佩、李纯青（马再光代）等。
