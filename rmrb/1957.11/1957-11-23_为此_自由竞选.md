For This "Free Election"
　　Shi Lü

　　Four cars sped along a highway by Shasta Lake in California. Suddenly, the convoy screeched to a halt, and a dozen men and women jumped out of the cars, led by a burly man, and walked toward a tent in the roadside pine forest. Before a couple picnicking there could speak, the burly man grabbed them, shook their hands enthusiastically, and shouted, "I am Senator Knowland," while putting on a smiling face for the cameras of the seven or eight reporters who followed. After the photos were taken, the group said "Goodbye" and immediately returned to the cars, speeding away again, leaving the couple standing there bewildered by the sudden commotion, staring blankly at the cloud of dust kicked up by the convoy in the distance, unable to figure out what was going on.

　　Of course, it wouldn't take them long to understand what was happening. This American-style election gimmick of shaking hands and taking photos with voters (along with beauty queens parading, kissing babies, throwing candy, etc.) marks the beginning of a new political campaign for Senator Knowland, whose term is about to expire—this time, it's for Governor of California.

　　Knowland's decision not to run for re-election as a U.S. Senator but instead to run for Governor of California is completely driven by ulterior motives. He sees the California governorship as a stepping stone, preparing to run for President of the United States in 1960 or 1964, which is an open secret in American political circles. Among the forty-eight states in the United States, California is the second-largest state in terms of total population, second only to New York, and it has the right to appoint thirty-two of the total five hundred and thirty-one "presidential electors" in the United States; whoever becomes the Governor of California has a favorable position to manipulate the election, and thus has the greatest possibility of controlling these thirty-two "presidential electors." Precisely because of this, Knowland has long broadcasted his intention to run for Governor of California, and as soon as the congressional session ended, he immediately returned to California to strive to be nominated as a candidate next June.

　　Knowland's plan has clearly received the full support of the American monopoly capitalist groups. Every four years, those billionaires always pick out two loyal servants, one wearing a donkey head (Democrat) and the other wearing an elephant mask (Republican), to put on an election show, sending one of them into the White House. To prepare for the performances in 1960 and 1964, the American monopoly capitalist groups are now beginning to select several possible candidates from its team of loyal servants, and Knowland is one of them.

　　It is certainly no accident that Knowland has gained such favor from the American monopoly groups. This extremely reactionary politician, who is considered an enemy of labor in domestic policy and called the "Senator from Taiwan" in foreign policy, has always been very pleasing to the billionaires. Therefore, although his seniority in the Senate is not high, he was quickly and exceptionally promoted to the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate, and the propaganda tools of monopoly capital have tried their best to promote him. For example, the mouthpiece of Wall Street, "Newsweek," even praised him as a political "genius."

　　Relying on such political capital, Knowland returned to his hometown full of ambition, ready to easily seize the position of Governor of California.

　　However, things did encounter some minor twists and turns. The current Governor of California, Knight (also a Republican), was reluctant to give up this lucrative post. He also wanted to run for re-election, paving the way to the White House for himself. Therefore, at a banquet welcoming Knowland, Knight publicly warned Knowland not to compete for the governorship; and in the weeks after Knowland apparently smiled dismissively at this warning, Knight continued to deliver speeches attacking Knowland, putting on a posture of fighting Knowland to the death on the issue of vying for nomination as the gubernatorial candidate.

　　Since both of them wanted to fight for the nomination, and, it is said that American elections are "free," and "anyone can strive to be nominated as a candidate," then let them fight it out! However, at this juncture, American "democracy" and "freedom" played a miraculous role: Knight, who had previously seemed like a combative little rooster, suddenly announced dejectedly on November 5 that he was withdrawing from the gubernatorial race and instead running for the Senate seat vacated by Knowland.

　　What was going on? It turned out that the magic wand of the American monopoly capitalist groups had been waved. Although Knight was also a loyal servant of the billionaires, he had not been favored to the extent that he could be included in the list of White House candidates, so he had to make way for Knowland.

　　The story is this: While Knight was delivering a series of combative speeches, Chandler, the big financier of California and the owner of the "Los Angeles Times," gave Knight three "advices" in a row. The last "advice" was even conveyed orally by Chandler's wife herself. The content of the "advice" was straightforward—if Knight withdrew from the gubernatorial race, Chandler could help him run for the Senate; if Knight did not listen, Chandler would use the entire public opinion of California to oppose him and make him receive no financial support.

　　In the United States, what kind of election can be conducted without money?

　　At this time, the current U.S. Vice President Nixon, who was also included in the list of White House candidates by the billionaires, also sent a message to Knight: as long as he withdrew from the gubernatorial race, then, even if he failed to be elected as a senator next year, he could be guaranteed a lucrative position in the Eisenhower administration.

　　Thus, on November 5, Knight flew to Washington and personally received guarantees from Eisenhower and Nixon, and then "voluntarily" announced his withdrawal from the gubernatorial race.

　　As for why Nixon supported Knowland, providing Knowland with a stepping stone to the White House? Was he not afraid that Knowland would compete with him for the Republican presidential nomination in 1960? Regarding this, the monopoly capitalist groups also had arrangements: unless the situation changed, Knowland would support Nixon's election in 1960, and Nixon would support Knowland's election in 1964.

　　Now, the newspapers and magazines, television and radio of American monopoly capital are doing their utmost to promote the victorious prospects of Knowland easily obtaining the position of Governor of California. However, people can clearly see the truth of the American bourgeoisie's "democratic election" and "free nomination" from this smoky and foul-smelling political circus.

    为此“自由竞选”
    施旅
    四辆小汽车沿着加里福尼亚州沙斯塔湖边的一条公路疾驶着。突然，车队猛地停了下来，从车厢里跳出来十来名男女，由一名彪形大汉领着，向路边松树林子里的一座帐篷走去，不等正在那里野餐的一对夫妇开口，大汉就一把抓住了这对夫妇，热烈地握起手来，大声叫道：“我是参议员诺兰”，同时摆出一付笑脸来对着跟来的七、八名新闻记者的照相机镜头。摄影完毕，这群人一声“再见”，立刻回到汽车里，又风驰电掣地开走了，只剩下那对被一阵纷乱闹得晕头转向的夫妇站在那里，迷惘地望着远处被车队扬起的一片尘土，弄不清这究竟是怎么回事。
    当然，他们用不着过多久就会明白这是怎么回事的。这套同选民握手、合影的美国式竞选把戏（还要加上美女游街、亲吻婴儿、抛扔糖果等等），标志着任期将满的参议员诺兰先生已经开始投入新的政治活动中——这回是竞选加里福尼亚州州长了。
    诺兰先生不去竞选连任美国参议员，而要竞选加里福尼亚州州长，完全是醉翁之意不在酒。他把加州州长当作进身之阶，准备在1960年或1964年竞选美国总统的职位，这在美国政治圈中已是公开的秘密了。在美国的四十八个州中，加州是人口总数仅次于纽约州的第二大州，它有权利指派美国全部五百三十一名“总统选举人”中的三十二名；谁做了加州州长，谁就有了操纵选举的有利条件，从而也就有最大的可能去掌握这三十二名“总统选举人”。正是因为这样，诺兰早就放出了他要竞选加州州长的空气，而且一等国会会议结束，就马上回到加州争取在明年6月被提名为候选人。
    诺兰的计划显然得到了美国垄断资本集团的完全支持。那些亿万富翁们每隔四年总要挑出两个忠诚的仆人来，一个戴着驴头（民主党），一个挂着象面（共和党），演出一套选举把戏，把其中的一个送进白宫去。为了准备1960年和1964年的演出，美国垄断资本集团现在就要着手从它的忠仆队伍中挑出几个可能的候选人，而诺兰就是其中的一个。
    诺兰能够得到美国垄断集团这样的宠爱，当然不是偶然的。这个在国内政策上被认为是劳工的敌人，在外交政策上被称为“来自台湾的参议员”的极端反动的政客，一向是被亿万富翁们看得十分顺眼的。因此，他在参议院的年资虽然不高，却被很快地破格提拔为参议院共和党的领袖，而且垄断资本的宣传工具极力为他吹捧，比如，华尔街的喉舌“新闻周刊”甚至誉他为政治上的“天才”。
    正是依靠着这样的政治资本，诺兰踌躇满志地回到故乡，准备垂手而取加州州长这一职位。
    不过，事情还是发生了一些小曲折。现任的加州州长纳埃特（也是共和党人）舍不得这一肥缺，他还要竞选连任，为自己铺平到白宫的道路。因此，就在一个欢迎诺兰的宴会上，纳埃特公开警告诺兰不得争夺州长的位置；而在诺兰显然是胸有成竹地对这一警告置之一笑之后的几个星期之内，纳埃特更是不断地发表演说攻击诺兰，摆出了一副要在争取提名为州长候选人的问题上同诺兰拚个你死我活的架子。
    既然两个人都想争取提名，而且，据说美国的竞选是“自由”的，“任何人都可以争取被提名为候选人”，那末，就让他们俩人争个明白吧！然而，就在这个节骨眼上，美国的“民主”和“自由”发生了奇妙的作用：先前那么像个好斗的小公鸡似的纳埃特，忽然在11月5日垂头丧气地宣布他退出州长的竞选，改为竞选诺兰空下来的参议员职位了。
    这是怎么回事呢？原来美国垄断资本集团的魔杖挥动起来了。纳埃特虽然也是亿万富翁们的忠仆，但毕竟还没有被宠爱到可以列入白宫候选人名单中的程度，因此他必须为诺兰让出道来。
    事情是这样的：就在纳埃特接连发表好斗的演说的时候，加里福尼亚州的大财阀、“洛杉矶时报”的老板张德勒接连向纳埃特提出了三次“忠告”，最后一次的“忠告”还是由张德勒的老婆亲自口头传达的。“忠告”的内容很干脆——如果纳埃特退出州长的竞选，张德勒可以帮忙他竞选参议员；如果纳埃特不听话，张德勒就要使全加里福尼亚州的舆论都反对他，并且使他得不到任何财政支持。
    在美国，没有钱还能进行什么竞选呢？
    这时候，另一名被亿万富翁们列入白宫候选人名单中的现任美国副总统尼克松也托人带了口信给纳埃特：只要他退出州长的竞选，那末，万一明年选不上参议员，也可以保证在艾森豪威尔政府中给他一个肥缺。
    就这样，纳埃特于11月5日飞到华盛顿，亲自从艾森豪威尔和尼克松那里得到了保证之后，“自动”宣布退出州长的竞选。
    至于尼克松为什么要支持诺兰，提供诺兰一块白宫的敲门砖呢？难道他不怕诺兰在1960年同他竞争共和党的总统候选人吗？关于这一点，垄断资本集团也有了安排：除非形势有变化，否则，就由诺兰在1960年支持尼克松竞选，而尼克松则在1964年支持诺兰竞选。
    现在，美国垄断资本的报纸和刊物、电视和广播正以全力鼓吹诺兰垂手而取得加州州长职位的胜利前景。但是，人们从这场乌烟瘴气的政治马戏中却分明地看出了美国资产阶级的“民主竞选”、“自由提名”的真相。
