Simultaneously Increase Coal Production and Conserve Coal Use
State Council Issues Directive on Strengthening Leadership in Coal Mines, Unleashing Production Potential, Increasing Coal Production, and Vigorously Conserving Coal Use

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch The State Council issued a directive on October 30 regarding strengthening leadership in coal mines, unleashing production potential, increasing coal production, and vigorously conserving coal use. The full text of the directive is as follows:

This year, all coal mine workers enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council regarding the increase production and practice economy movement, actively unleashing production potential. From January to September, they overfulfilled the state plan, increasing raw coal production by 3.04 million tons, and reached the production level stipulated for 1957 in the First Five-Year Plan five months ahead of schedule. This is undoubtedly a great achievement. However, coal production still cannot meet the needs of national economic construction and the people's livelihood. Currently, coal inventory levels in all units are lower than the same period last year, while the demand for coal in production, transportation, and daily life has greatly increased. Therefore, coal supply will remain very tight this winter and spring, and for a relatively long period in the future. To this end, under the further implementation of the Party Central Committee and the State Council's instructions on increasing production and practicing economy, state-owned and locally state-owned coal mines across the country should unleash all positive factors, continue to tap production potential, and make the greatest possible efforts to increase coal production. Industrial, transportation, government, school, military, and urban and rural residents throughout the country should, based on the principles of running enterprises and undertakings diligently and thriftily and managing households diligently and thriftily, adopt various specific and effective measures to vigorously conserve coal. Only by simultaneously increasing coal production and conserving coal use, and earnestly implementing both, can the tense coal supply situation be alleviated.

Coal mining enterprises across the country have already achieved great results in the increase production and practice economy movement, but many problems still exist. For example, in the mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry, due to poor production preparation work in many units, only 92% of all tunnel excavation was completed from January to August, and even more seriously, only 84% of the main tunnels were completed. The phenomenon of lax labor discipline and low worker attendance rates is also very serious. From January to August, the attendance rate of production workers was only 87.6%, a decrease of 2.9% compared to the same period last year. Poor production preparation work and low attendance rates are the main obstacles to improving coal production. At the same time, major accidents in coal mines have increased compared to the same period last year, and the product quality of some coal mines has also declined. From these situations, it can be seen that coal mines still have considerable production potential. The problem lies in improving production management, resolving existing problems in a timely manner, and continuing to deepen the increase production and practice economy movement in conjunction with the rectification movement in the coal mines.

The socialist ideological education and rectification movement currently underway in industrial and mining enterprises across the country is the most effective way to improve leadership and increase production. Many coal mines, by promoting democracy in the rectification, implementing rectification while correcting, and strengthening ideological and political leadership, have made preliminary improvements in their work, initially rectified labor discipline, and increased attendance rates, resulting in rapid increases in output. The Xishan Coal Mine and Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi Province are good examples of this. After the rectification movement, the Xishan Coal Mine not only improved its leadership but also dug out bad elements who had infiltrated the ranks of workers, exposing nine small cliques of hooligans, thieves, those living off labor insurance, and those inciting trouble and making accusations, thereby greatly raising the consciousness of the workers. The attendance rate of workers in this mine has reached more than 90%, and the output has increased from an average daily output of 6,467 tons in July to 8,000 tons in October, and they have proposed to overfulfill this year's state plan by 20%. This shows that as long as the Party Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement are resolutely implemented and work is earnestly improved, it is entirely possible to increase coal production. To this end, in addition to requiring the Ministry of Coal Industry to strengthen leadership over coal mines in various regions, the People's Committees of provinces (cities) and autonomous regions are also required to strengthen leadership over all coal mines within their jurisdiction, earnestly carry out the rectification movement, resolutely implement rectification while correcting, improve management systems, adjust labor organization, do a good job in regular operations, rectify labor discipline, and increase attendance rates. Extremely serious violations of law and discipline, incorrigible hooligans, ruffians, thieves, and anti-socialist elements who have infiltrated the ranks of workers must be severely dealt with. Through rectification and great debates, promote righteousness, suppress evil, and enhance the workers' class consciousness and sense of ownership, thereby greatly increasing labor productivity and producing more coal for the country.

While striving to fulfill this year's production increase tasks, attention must be paid to improving coal quality; strictly implement rules and regulations, and strive to achieve safe production; and make overall arrangements for production in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year, in order to vigorously reverse the situation of unfulfilled excavation tasks, improve underground maintenance work and mechanical and electrical repair work, and prepare for production in 1958, especially in the first quarter, to ensure continuous improvement in output.

In the increase production and practice economy movement, in addition to requiring coal mines to vigorously conserve materials (especially pit props), equipment, electricity, etc., needed by coal mines, relevant departments must also vigorously support them. In terms of railway transportation, coal should be given priority in transportation this winter. The coal transportation plan for the fourth quarter should be well arranged, and necessary consideration should also be given to the transportation of coal for the winter market. Local coal mines mainly rely on highway transportation, and provinces (cities) and autonomous regions should repair highways in a timely manner and vigorously organize civilian transportation forces to strive for more production and more transportation.

Regarding the exploitation of small coal kilns, provinces (cities) and autonomous regions should, in accordance with the State Council's instructions on developing small coal kilns, earnestly strengthen leadership, pay attention to safety, prevent spontaneous combustion, reasonably stipulate coal prices and freight rates, and actively organize transportation and sales to meet the needs of local people.

In order to alleviate the current tight coal supply situation, in addition to the fact that coal mines should strive to increase production, industrial, transportation, government, school, military, and urban and rural residents across the country must take effective measures to vigorously conserve coal. According to materials collected by the Coal Construction Company of the Ministry of Commerce from various parts of the country, general boiler coal consumption can be reduced by about 20% after improving combustion techniques and improving some equipment, indicating that the potential for conservation is still very large. The coal consumption quotas for production and transportation in the central industrial and transportation departments can also be further reduced. Although coal consumption accounts for a small proportion of product costs in some departments, they should not relax effective measures to reduce coal consumption quotas; the self-use coal of the various mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry must also be strictly controlled and efforts should be made to conserve it. Coal for heating and daily life can also be greatly conserved. According to this year's calendar, the lunar calendar has a leap month of August, and the cold season may come later. The heating period for offices, organizations, schools, and military units can be appropriately postponed. Regarding specific methods for conserving coal, all central departments, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities are required to conduct mass discussions and research in conjunction with the current rectification movement, and then formulate practical and feasible conservation targets and measures based on specific conditions for implementation.

    增产煤炭和节约用煤同时并举
    国务院发布关于加强煤矿领导、发挥生产潜力、增产煤炭和大力节约用煤的指示
    新华社讯　国务院于10月30日发布关于加强煤矿领导、发挥生产潜力、增产煤炭和大力节约用煤的指示。指示全文如下：
    今年全体煤矿职工热烈地响应了党中央和国务院关于增产节约运动的号召，积极地发挥了生产的潜力，1—9月份超额完成了国家计划，增产原煤三百零四万吨，并且提前五个月达到了第一个五年计划规定的1957年的生产水平，这无疑地是一个很大的成绩。但是，煤炭生产仍然不能满足国家经济建设和人民生活的需要，目前各单位煤炭的库存量都比去年同期下降，而生产、运输和生活等各方面对于煤的需求却大大增加了，因此，今冬明春以及在今后一个比较长的时间内，煤炭的供应仍将是十分紧张的。为此，在进一步贯彻执行党中央和国务院增产节约的指示下，全国国营和地方国营的煤矿，应当发挥一切积极因素，继续挖掘生产潜力，尽最大可能地努力增产煤炭；全国工业、交通运输业、机关、学校、部队、城乡居民，应当根据勤俭办企业、事业和勤俭持家的原则，采取各种具体有效的措施，大力节约煤炭。只有使增加煤的生产和节约用煤同时并举，并且认真地贯彻执行，煤炭供应的紧张情况，才能有所缓和。
    全国煤矿企业在增产节约运动中，已经取得了很大的成绩，但是也还存在不少的问题。如煤炭部所属各矿，由于不少单位生产准备工作做得不好，全部巷道掘进1—8月份只完成计划的92％，更严重的是主要巷道只完成计划的84％；劳动纪律松弛、工人出勤率低的现象也是很严重的，1—8月份生产工人出勤率仅达87．6％，比去年同期下降了2．9％。生产准备工作差和出勤率低是当前煤炭生产提高的主要障碍。同时，煤矿的重大事故比去年同期增多了，有些煤矿的产品质量也有下降的情况。从这些情况来看，煤矿还是有相当的增产潜力的，问题在于必须改善生产管理，及时解决存在的问题，并且结合煤矿中整风运动，继续深入开展增产节约运动。
    目前全国工矿企业正在开展着的社会主义思想教育和整风运动，是改进领导和提高生产最为有效的办法。很多煤矿由于在整风中发扬了民主，贯彻了边整边改，加强了思想政治领导，工作已有初步改进，劳动纪律得到初步整顿，出勤率有了提高，因而产量迅速增长。如山西的西山煤矿和大同煤矿，便是一个很好的例子。西山煤矿经过整风运动，不仅改进了领导，而且挖出了混入工人队伍中的坏分子，揭发出流氓、偷盗、吃劳保、煽动闹事告状等小集团九个，从而大大提高了工人群众的觉悟，该矿的工人出勤率已达到90％以上，产量已经由7月份平均日产量六千四百六十七吨提高到10月份的八千吨，并且提出可以超额20％来完成今年的国家计划。这说明只要坚决贯彻执行党中央关于整风运动的指示，认真地改进工作，增加煤炭产量是完全可能的。为此，除要求煤炭工业部对各地煤矿加强领导以外，要求各省
  （市）、自治区人民委员会对所辖范围内全部煤矿也应当加强领导，认真地展开整风运动，坚决贯彻边整边改，改进管理制度，调整劳动组织，搞好正规作业，整顿劳动纪律，提高出勤率。对于极少数混入工人队伍中的严重违法乱纪、屡教不改的流氓、阿飞、盗窃等坏分子和反社会主义分子，必须给予严肃的处理。经过整风和大辩论，发扬正气，压倒邪气，提高工人的阶级觉悟和主人翁感，从而大大提高劳动生产率，为国家增产更多的煤炭。
    在努力完成今年增产任务的同时，必须注意提高煤炭质量；严格执行规程制度，力争做到安全生产；并且对于今年第四季度和明年第一季度的生产要作统盘安排，以便大力扭转掘进完不成任务的局面，改善井下维修工作和机电检修工作，给1958年尤其是第一季度生产作好准备，以保证产量不断的提高。
    在增产节约运动中，对于煤矿所需器材
  （尤其是坑木）、设备、电力等供应，除要求煤矿大力节约以外，各有关部门还必须大力予以支援。在铁路运输方面，今年冬季要优先运输煤炭，第四季度的煤炭运输计划应当好好安排，对冬季市场用煤的运输，也应当予以必要的照顾。地方煤矿主要靠公路运输，各省（市）、自治区应当及时修补公路，并且大力组织民间运输力量，争取多产多运。
    对于小煤窑的开采，各省（市）、自治区应该根据国务院关于发展小煤窑的指示，切实加强领导，注重安全，防止自然发火，合理规定煤价和运价，积极组织运销，以满足当地人民的需要。
    为了缓和目前煤炭供应的紧张情况，除了煤矿应当努力增产以外，全国工业、交通运输业、机关、学校、部队和城乡居民必须采取有效措施大力节约用煤。从商业部煤建公司搜集的全国各地的材料来看，一般锅炉用煤在改进烧火技术和改善部分设备之后，可以节约20％左右，可见节约的潜力还是很大的。中央各工业、交通部门生产和运输的耗煤定额，也可以进一步降低。有些部门虽然用煤在产品成本中所占比重很小，但是也不应当放松对降低耗煤定额的有效措施；煤炭部各矿的自用煤也必须严格进行控制，努力节约。取暖和生活用煤，也可以大量节约。按照今年节令，农历是闰8月，寒季可能来得迟一些，各机关、团体、学校、部队烤火期可以适当推迟一些。关于节约用煤的具体办法，要求中央各部门、各省、自治区和直辖市结合当前整风，展开群众性的讨论和研究，然后根据具体情况，订出切实可行的节约指标和措施，贯彻执行。
