    "The Coal Scuttle of Central Asia" -- Kyrgyzstan

    In the Kyrgyz Republic, which is located right next to our Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Tian Shan and Pamir-Alai mountains occupy three-quarters of its area. In the wide valleys of these mountains, sunshine and moisture are abundant, and lush pastures grow, forming very rich mountain pastures. Therefore, Kyrgyzstan is a country with highly developed animal husbandry.

    Before the October Revolution, animal husbandry was the most important economic sector in Kyrgyzstan, and the people lived a nomadic life. Now, the republic has established collective farms and state farms, and the heavy nomadic life is gone forever. Moreover, in addition to the further development of animal husbandry, the sown area of ​​crops such as cotton, wheat, and sugar beets has greatly increased as the area of ​​irrigated land expands day by day. Take sugar beets as an example. Kyrgyzstan did not cultivate this crop at all before the revolution. Now the sown area of ​​sugar beets has reached 30,000 hectares, and the yield per unit area ranks first in the Soviet Union. In addition, the Fergana Valley produces a lot of cotton. In 1956, the republic's production of raw cotton increased to more than 154,000 tons.

    In the Kyrgyz Republic, antimony and mercury reserves rank first in the Soviet Union, and hydropower resources, coal, and oil are also very abundant. The output of coal and oil has exceeded that of Italy and Japan. Coal production ranks first among the Central Asian republics, so it is known as the "coal scuttle of Central Asia." However, before the revolution, Kyrgyzstan had virtually no industry. Industry was established and developed in the Soviet era. At present, the republic has more than 500 large industrial enterprises, including not only various agricultural product processing factories, but also machinery manufacturing and non-ferrous metallurgy enterprises. The total industrial output value in 1956 was 42 times that of 1913 before the revolution, and power generation increased 3,100 times. Now the output of industry every eight days is equal to the entire year's output of Kyrgyzstan before the revolution.

    Because mountains occupy most of Kyrgyzstan, before the revolution it was almost a borderland without major roads, only narrow paths passable by camels and horses. After the revolution, road construction was vigorously carried out. Now the highway has reached more than 13,000 kilometers, and automobiles account for more than 80% of the freight volume. Railways have also been built in the north.

    Kyrgyzstan, which had no written language before the revolution, has not only established its own national written language, but has also long eliminated illiteracy, and culture has been vigorously developed. At present, Kyrgyzstan, with a population of only 1.9 million, has eight institutions of higher learning, and the number of college students per 10,000 residents is almost twice as high as that of France, an old-brand capitalist country. Forty years ago, there were very few specialized talents with higher or secondary education working in Kyrgyzstan. Now there are more than 50,000 experts in the national economy of the republic. In short, the Communist Party and the Soviet regime have completely transformed the face of this republic.

    The city of Frunze, the birthplace of the outstanding proletarian general Frunze, is the capital of the republic. It has more than 70 factories and is the industrial and cultural center of Kyrgyzstan.

### “中亚的煤斗”——吉尔吉斯

    “中亚的煤斗”——吉尔吉斯
    在紧靠我国新疆维吾尔自治区的吉尔吉斯共和国，天山和帕米尔—阿拉依山占据了它的面积的四分之三。在这些山脉的宽阔的谷地，阳光和水分都很充足，长着繁茂的牧草，形成了非常富饶的山间牧场。所以吉尔吉斯是个畜牧业很发达的国家。
    十月革命以前，畜牧业是吉尔吉斯最主要的经济部门，人民过的是游牧生活。现在，共和国建立了集体农庄和国营农场，沉重的游牧生活已经一去不复返了。而且，除畜牧业获得了进一步的发展外，因为灌溉田地的面积一天天扩大，棉花、小麦、甜菜等农作物的播种面积都大大增加了。就以甜菜来说吧，革命前的吉尔吉斯根本不培植这种作物，现在甜菜的播种面积已达三万公顷，单位面积产量占苏联第一位。此外，费尔干谷地出产的棉花很多，1956年共和国生产的原棉已增加到十五万四千多吨。
    在吉尔吉斯共和国，锑和水银的蕴藏量占苏联第一位，水力资源、煤、石油也都很丰富。煤和石油的产量已经超过了意大利和日本。煤产量在中亚各共和国中占第一位，所以它有“中亚的煤斗”之称。不过革命前的吉尔吉斯，根本谈不上什么工业，工业都是在苏维埃时代建立和发展起来的。目前共和国拥有五百多个大型工业企业，其中不但有各种农产品加工工厂，还有机器制造和有色冶金企业。1956年的工业总产值已为革命前1913年的四十二倍，发电量增加为三千一百倍。现在工业每八天的产量，就等于革命前吉尔吉斯的全年产量。
    由于山脉占去了吉尔吉斯的大部分地方，所以革命前这儿几乎是个没有大路的边疆，有的只是骆驼和马可以运行的羊肠小径。革命后大力展开了筑路工作，现在公路已达一万三千多公里，80％以上的货运量都是由汽车担负的。北部还修建了铁路。
    革命前没有文字的吉尔吉斯，现在不仅建立了本民族的文字，而且早已扫除了文盲，文化得到了蓬勃的发展。目前这个只有一百九十万人口的吉尔吉斯，有八所高等学校，每一万居民中的大学生人数几乎比老牌资本主义国家法国多一倍。四十年前，在吉尔吉斯工作的受过高等或中等教育的专门人材，是屈指可数的，现在共和国的国民经济中有五万多名专家。总之，共产党和苏维埃政权完全改造了这个共和国的面貌。
    无产阶级的杰出将领伏龙芝出生的地方——伏龙芝市，是共和国首都，这里有七十多个工厂，是吉尔吉斯的工业和文化中心。
