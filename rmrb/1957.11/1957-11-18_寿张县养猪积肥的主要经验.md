	Main Experiences of Shou Zhang County in Pig Raising and Manure Accumulation
	Dazhong Daily Reporter
	Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, is located close to the northern bank of the Yellow River. Most villages are riverbeds and flood detention areas. The masses have never had the habit of raising pigs and accumulating manure. The masses in the riverbed area are worried about moving when the water rises and are unwilling to raise pigs; the masses in the flood detention area are also unwilling to raise pigs and accumulate manure. Before 1952, the county only had more than 2,000 pigs. During the period of primary cooperatives, the number of pigs increased, but by the end of August 1955, the county had only increased to more than 6,900 pigs. Adding the villages划过来的从阳谷县 from Yanggu County, there were no more than 8,000, an average of one pig for every eleven households and one hundred mu of land. Due to the lack of pigs and fertilizer, the average annual yield per mu in the county was only 226 and a half jin.
	The advanced cooperatives encouraged the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. Collective production created favorable conditions for the development of pig raising. The Party Committee strengthened its leadership over this work. Therefore, the pig raising industry in the county developed rapidly in a short period of time. In the single year of 1956, the number of live pigs in the county increased to more than 94,900. Now, the total number of pigs in the county has increased to 182,000, an average of 2.5 pigs per household. This is an increase of nearly 22 times compared to two years ago. The masses have clearly realized that raising pigs is beneficial to themselves, the community, and the country. At present, except for the riverbed area where pig raising is impossible due to perennial disasters, most areas of the county are raising pigs in every household and every household has a pigsty.

  Three Major Problems Need to Be Solved in Developing Pig Raising
	In the past two years, the rapid development of pig raising in Shou Zhang County has not been smooth sailing. Many problems have been encountered in the middle. These problems have been resolved under the proper arrangements of the Party and government leaders. The main ones are the following three problems:
	First, feed: When Shou Zhang County decided to develop pig raising on a large scale in 1955, it made certain arrangements for pig feed. At that time, the county had a bumper harvest; of the 40,000 mu of sweet potatoes planted, 7,000 mu were Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes, which yielded twice as much as local varieties, reaching more than 2,000 jin per mu. Therefore, Shou Zhang County decided on a preliminary plan to develop pig raising in 1956 based on the pig raising situation of some typical cooperatives. After ideological mobilization, the enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs rose rapidly, and the number of live pigs increased sharply, followed by a period of feed shortage. Some were worried that there would be no feed after adding pigs, and some even wanted to sell pigs. The reason for this was mainly that cadres and the masses believed that the scope of feed was too narrow, or wanted to rely solely on grain. In order to solve this problem, the county not only carried out ideological education and organized visits, but mainly adopted comprehensive arrangements, expanded the scope of feed, and tried to reduce grain consumption as much as possible. The first is to rely on the masses to open up sources of coarse feed in many ways. In the past year, the county has found and successfully tested 50 or 60 kinds of coarse feed, including various tree leaves, wild vegetables, crop bran, and so on. By October of this year, the county's 88 cooperatives had accumulated 54 million jin of dried vegetables. This number alone can solve the coarse feed problem for 120,000 live pigs. Secondly, comprehensive arrangements were also made in advance for concentrate feed, mainly: (1) mobilizing cooperatives to vigorously increase the planting of high-yield crops, such as sweet potatoes, winter squash, etc.; (2) starting this year to promote the establishment of feed bases in order to completely solve the problem of pig feed.
	Second, pig source: In the past, the masses in Shou Zhang County raised pigs mostly for meat, and did not pay attention to the feeding of sows. Therefore, before August 1955, the county only had more than 130 sows; coupled with the low reproductive rate of sows, piglets were extremely scarce. Many cooperatives sent people to Qingfeng and other counties hundreds of miles away to buy them. The County Party Committee studied the pig raising development plan and believed that in order to complete the target of reaching 100,000 pigs in 1956, it was necessary to raise 10,000 sows. The source of these sows must be solved by ourselves. Therefore, it was decided to adopt the policy of cooperative breeding and household raising, self-breeding and self-raising, and grasp the link of raising more sows and breeding pigs to vigorously breed. In implementing this policy, they took the following measures: (1) summarize the benefits of feeding sows and enlighten the enthusiasm of cooperatives and members to feed sows; (2) cooperatives establish piglet breeding farms; (3) vigorously promote the experience of double mating and remating to improve the reproductive rate of sows; (4) educate cooperatives not to castrate during a certain period; (5) cooperatives give more care to members who increase the raising of sows in terms of feed and private plots than to those who raise general pigs. In this way, the number of sows increased rapidly, ensuring the source of piglets. By mid-October of this year, the county had raised more than 27,000 sows, more than 200 times that of the primary cooperative period. Generally, cooperatives raise three or five hundred sows, and Taiqian, Sizuo Peng and other cooperatives raise more than a thousand. The situation in some cooperatives in this county proves that the principle of "cooperative breeding and household raising" must be adhered to in developing sows. This is because: cooperatives have piglet farms, which can breed a large number; while members raise too many sows, which can easily affect agricultural labor and foster capitalist ideas.
	Third, epidemic prevention: Shou Zhang County did not have enough understanding of epidemic prevention when developing live pigs on a large scale, which led to a widespread pig epidemic this spring, with more than 20,000 live pigs dying and being sold. The county, district, and township leading departments immediately took emergency measures, quickly established epidemic prevention organizations, assigned special personnel to be responsible for this work, and timely introduced the feeding and epidemic prevention methods of the Song Changsheng Cooperative; at the same time, the County Party Committee also summarized and promoted the experience of the Yao Shao Township Cooperative in not having pig epidemics. The experience of this cooperative is mainly: self-breeding and self-raising, not buying pigs from other places, members do not buy pork at the market; classify and queue up live pigs, feed them in separate pens and troughs, and master the seasonal characteristics to feed cooked food or warm food, and appropriately add salt. In addition, regular epidemic prevention injections and disinfection of pens are carried out. After the experience of the Yao Shao Township Cooperative was widely promoted and a mass epidemic prevention campaign was carried out in depth, the county basically prevented the occurrence of pig epidemics.

  The Party Committee Strengthening Leadership is a Decisive Factor
	The decisive factor in the rapid development of pig raising in Shou Zhang County is that the Party Committee has effectively strengthened its leadership over this work.
	During the primary cooperative period, pig raising and manure accumulation work in the county had a certain development. However, due to the lack of understanding of the significance of this work by the leadership and the lack of specific measures, the progress of pig raising was slow. After the advanced cooperative, the County Party Committee, according to the instructions of the higher-level Party Committee, after inspection, realized that the reason for the slow increase in agricultural production in the county was poor soil quality and lack of fertilizer; at the same time, it investigated some typical cooperatives and learned that those who raised more pigs and had sufficient manure fertilizer had significant increases in production. In general, one cart of coarse fertilizer can increase production by 30 to 40 jin. The county's 88 cooperatives, 820,000 mu of land, except for the riverbed area where production is not guaranteed, the remaining 600,000 mu of land, if one more cart of fertilizer is applied per mu per year, can increase production by more than 20 million jin of grain. This further confirms that raising pigs and accumulating manure is indeed an important measure to increase production. From then on, the County Party Committee was determined to vigorously mobilize the masses to carry out pig raising and manure accumulation campaigns, and effectively strengthened its leadership over pig raising and manure accumulation work.
	In the specific leadership of this work, Party Committees at all levels have always grasped these links:
	1. Set an example to educate the masses. In the past, Shou Zhang County did not have the habit of raising pigs and accumulating manure. After deciding to raise pigs on a large scale, cadres and the masses generally reflected: "There is no habit of raising pigs!" "Raising pigs may not necessarily increase grain production" and so on. After learning about these situations, the County Party Committee summarized the experience of Men Zhaoshan of Gao Miao Village, Zhao Sheng Bai Township, in mobilizing his family to raise pigs by calculating detailed accounts; and used the Taiqian Cooperative as a base point to summarize experience and guide the county. Universal publicity was carried out with these typical examples, and the effect was good. Each district and township also often used typical examples to educate the masses.
	They not only have typical examples from top to bottom, but also have typical examples in everything. For example, when mobilizing the masses to open up sources of coarse feed, they summarized the experience of Liu Lundao, a member of the Taiqian Township Cooperative, in feeding fat pigs well with coarse feed instead of fine feed, targeting the idea that more grain must be fed to raise pigs well, and promoted it throughout the county.
	2. Plan layer by layer and implement it resolutely. In the pig raising and manure accumulation campaign in Shou Zhang County, after the ideological problem was solved, plans were formulated layer by layer from top to bottom. During the primary cooperative period, the County Party Committee also wanted to grasp pig raising and manure accumulation work, but it could not be grasped, mainly because it did not have a bottom line. Therefore, after the County Party Committee decided to raise pigs on a large scale, it first touched three bottom lines: (1) the bottom line of how much feed a live pig needs; (2) the bottom line of grain production in the county; (3) the bottom line of the feeding capacity of each district. According to the bottom line situation, the pig raising capacity of the county was estimated and a comprehensive plan was formulated. Therefore, the County Party Committee separately formulated plans to raise 100,000 pigs in 1956 and 180,000 pigs in 1957. Each district and township (cooperative) also formulated plans for their respective districts and townships (cooperatives) according to the conditions of their respective regions. Last year, the plan was generally completed, and this year, the plan can be overfulfilled.
	After the pig epidemic occurred this spring, the morale of the masses was greatly affected; especially the reduction in wheat production, many people shouted that there was no grain to feed. After the County Party Committee noticed this, it first investigated the situation of 13 cooperatives such as Taiqian, and proved that the vast majority of members had surplus grain; then it estimated the large account of the county's grain production in 1956: the total grain income of the county, in addition to paying the requisition and purchase tasks, and the various deductions of the cooperative, each member actually obtained an average of 620 jin of grain, in addition to rations, each household had an average surplus of grain that could completely feed three pigs. According to this situation, the County Party Committee determined that there was more than enough concentrate feed for pigs, and there was a material basis for developing pig raising. Therefore, it convened relevant meetings to specifically calculate this large account, which strengthened the confidence of the leaders and also strengthened the confidence of the cadres and the masses. From September to mid-October, the number of pigs in the county increased by more than 70,000.
	3. The secretary takes action, and the cadres take the lead. The Party Committee Secretary personally grasped this work and often studied the progress of this work. During the pig epidemic this spring, the County Party Committee convened an expanded cadre meeting of counties, districts, and townships, calling for "wherever it is tight, the secretary should go there" "the secretary should go deep into the pig farm." Comrade Liu Chuanyou, Secretary of the County Party Committee, discovered that a local method could cure the epidemic in a township cooperative, and immediately introduced it to the Taiqian Cooperative for trial. At the same time, Party members and cadres set an example, which played a great role in the pig raising campaign. Whichever township or cooperative cadres take the lead in raising pigs, there are more pigs raised in that township or cooperative. More than 80% or 90% of the more than 2,100 Party members and cadres in Chengguan District raised pigs. This drove the masses to raise pigs in large numbers.

    千方百计　广辟肥源　人人动手　积肥如山
    寿张县养猪积肥的主要经验
    大众日报记者
    山东寿张县紧靠黄河北岸，大部分乡村都是河床、滞洪区，群众从来没有养猪积肥的习惯。河床区的群众担心水涨搬家，不愿养猪；滞洪区的群众，也不愿猪养积肥。在1952年前，全县仅有猪二千余头。初级社时期，猪数虽有增加，但到1955年8月底，全县才增长到六千九百多头，加上从阳谷县划过来的乡村，也不过八千头，平均每十一户、百亩土地合猪一头。由于猪少肥缺，全县每亩年产量平均才到二百二十六斤半。
    高级合作化鼓舞了广大农民的生产热情。集体生产给养猪事业的发展创造了有利的条件。党委加强了对这个工作的领导。因此，全县的养猪事业在短期内得以飞跃发展。1956年一个年头，全县毛猪就增加到九万四千九百多头。现在，全县猪的总数已增加到十八万二千头，每户合到二点五头。比两年前增长了近二十二倍。群众已经清楚地认识到养猪是利己利社利国家的事情。目前，除河床区因常年有灾不能养猪外，全县大部分地区都是家家养猪、户户有圈。
  发展养猪事业要解决三大问题
    两年来，寿张县养猪事业的飞跃发展，并不是一帆风顺的，中间曾碰到不少问题。这些问题，都在党政领导方面的妥善安排下解决了。其中主要的有以下三个问题：
    第一，饲料：寿张县1955年决定大量发展养猪时，曾对猪的饲料作了一定安排。当时，全县丰收；种植的四万亩地瓜中，有七千亩是胜利百号地瓜，收获量较本地品种多产一倍，每亩产到二千多斤。因此，寿张县根据一些典型社养猪的情况决定了1956年发展养猪的初步计划。经过思想发动后，群众养猪的积极性迅速高涨，毛猪大量增加，接着一度发生饲料紧张的局面。有的顾虑添猪后没料喂，甚至有的想卖猪。究其原因，主要是干部群众认为饲料范围过窄，或想单独依靠粮食。为解决这个问题，该县除进行思想教育、组织参观外，主要是采取了全面安排，扩大饲料范围，尽量减少粮食消耗的办法。这首先是依靠群众多方面地开辟粗饲料来源。一年来，该县已找出并试验成功的粗饲料，有各种树叶、野菜、作物糠、麸等五六十种。到今年10月份，全县八十八个社已积存干菜五千四百万斤。仅此数就可解决十二万头毛猪粗饲料问题。其次，是对精饲料也预先作了全面安排，主要是：（一）发动合作社大力增种高产作物，如地瓜、北瓜等；（二）今年开始推行建立饲料基地，以便彻底解决猪饲料问题。
    第二，猪源：寿张县群众过去喂猪多是为了吃肉，不重视母猪的饲养。因此，到1955年8月前，全县仅有母猪一百三十余头；再加母猪繁殖率低，以致仔猪奇缺。不少社派人到百里外的清丰等县购买。县委研究了发展养猪计划，认为要完成1956年到达十万头的指标，必须养母猪一万头。这些母猪来源必须自己解决才行，于是决定采取社繁户养、自繁自养的方针，抓住多养母猪、种猪这一环，大力繁殖。在贯彻这个方针中，他们采取了以下措施：（一）总结喂养母猪的好处，启发社与社员喂养母猪的积极性；（二）合作社建立仔猪繁殖场；（三）大力推广双重配种和复配种的经验，提高母猪的繁殖率；（四）教育合作社在一定时期内不要阉割；（五）对增养母猪的社员，合作社在饲料及自留地等方面比喂一般猪多给予一些照顾。这样一来，母猪的数量迅速增加，保证了仔猪的来源。到今年10月中旬，全县已养母猪二万七千多头，为初级社时期的二百多倍。一般社都养母猪三、五百头，台前、四座棚等社都养到千头以上。从这个县一些社的情况证明，发展母猪必须坚持“社繁户养”的原则。这是因为：社里有仔猪场，可以大量繁殖；而社员喂养母猪过多，极易影响农业劳动，滋长资本主义思想。
    第三，防疫：寿张县在大量发展毛猪中，对防疫问题认识不足，以致今春普遍流行猪疫，病死与卖掉毛猪二万多头。县区乡领导部门立即采取紧急措施，迅速建立了防疫组织，责成专人负责此项工作，并及时介绍宋长生社的饲养、防疫办法；同时，县委也总结推广了姚邵乡社没发生猪疫的经验。这个社的经验主要是：自繁自养不买外地猪，社员不在集上买猪肉；对毛猪分类排队，分圈分槽喂养，并掌握季节特点分喂熟食或温食，适当加喂食盐。此外，并定期注射防疫及进行栏圈消毒等。经过广泛推广了姚邵乡社的经验，并深入开展群众性的防疫运动后，全县基本上防止了猪疫的发生。
  党委加强领导是决定性因素
    寿张县养猪事业飞跃发展的决定性因素是党委切实加强了对这一工作的领导。
    这个县在办初级社时期，养猪积肥工作有一定的发展。但由于领导方面对这一工作的意义认识不足，缺乏具体的措施，因而养猪进度缓慢。及至高级合作化后，县委根据上级党委的指示精神，经过检查认清了全县农业增产速度缓慢的原因，是土质差、肥料缺；同时，调查了一些典型社，了解到凡是养猪多粪肥足的，都增产显著，一车粗肥一般可增产三十斤到四十斤。全县八十八个社，八十二万亩土地，除河床区生产没有保证外，其余六十余万亩土地，如果一年每亩多上一车肥，就可增产二千多万斤粮。这更证实了，养猪积肥确是一项重要的增产措施。从此，县委决心大力发动群众开展养猪积肥运动，切实加强了对养猪积肥工作的领导。
    在具体领导这一工作中，各级党委经常掌握了这几个环节：
    一、拿出样子教育群众。寿张县过去没有养猪积肥的习惯，决定大量养猪以后，干部、群众较普遍地反映：“养猪没有习惯啊！”“养猪也不一定能多打粮”等等。县委了解到这些情况后，便总结了赵升白乡高庙村门兆山用算细账的办法动员全家养猪的经验；并以台前社为基点，总结经验指导全县。以这些典型事例进行普遍的宣传，效果良好。各区、各乡也经常拿出典型事例对群众进行教育。
    他们不仅上上下下有典型，而且事事有典型。譬如发动群众开辟粗饲料来源时，就针对群众认为多喂粮食才能喂好猪的思想，总结了台前乡社员刘伦道以粗代细喂好肥猪的经验，向全县推广。
    二、层层规划，坚决执行。寿张县在养猪积肥运动中，当思想问题解决后，随即从上到下层层制定规划。在初级社时期，县委也想抓养猪积肥工作，但是抓不起来，这主要由于不摸底。因此，县委决定大量养猪后，首先摸了三个底：（一）一口毛猪需要多少饲料的底；（二）全县粮食生产的底；（三）各区饲养能力的底。根据摸底情况，匡算全县的养猪能力，全面制订规划。所以，县委分别制订了1956年养猪到十万头，1957年养猪到十八万头的计划。各区、乡（社）也根据本地区的条件，分别制订本区、乡
  （社）的计划。去年大体上完成了计划，今年则能超额完成计划。
    今年春季发生猪疫以后，群众情绪受到很大影响；尤其麦季减产，很多人叫喊没有粮食喂。县委察觉后，首先调查了台前等十三个社的情况，证明绝大部分社员都有余粮；然后匡算了1956年全县的粮食产量的大账：全县粮食总收入，除了交纳征购任务，及社的各项扣留外，社员每人平均实得粮食六百二十斤，除口粮外，每户余粮平均喂养三头猪是完全可能的。根据这个情况，县委认定猪的精饲料绰绰有余，发展养猪有了物质基础。于是，召开有关会议具体算清了这笔大账，坚定了领导信心，也坚定了干部群众的信心。从9月到10月中旬，全县的猪增加了七万多头。
    三、书记动手，干部带头。党委书记亲自抓这项工作，经常研究这项工作的进展情况。在今春猪疫流行时，县委召开县区乡扩大干部会议，号召“那里吃紧，书记就到那里”“书记要深入猪场”。县委书记刘传友同志在一个乡社发现用土法可治好病疫，立即介绍给台前社试验。同时，党员、干部以身作则，对养猪运动起了很大作用。哪个乡、社干部带头养猪，这个乡社养的猪就多。城关区二千一百多名党员、干部，百分之八、九十都养了猪。这就带动了群众大量养猪。
