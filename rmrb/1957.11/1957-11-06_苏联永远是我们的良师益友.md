The 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution is approaching. Our people and overseas Chinese, like the working people all over the world, are welcoming this great festival with boundless excitement and gratitude.

Before the October Revolution, Russia was economically backward and had a large number of illiterate people. But now, the Soviet Union has become a first-class industrial power in the world. The speed of industrial development has far surpassed that of capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France, and it possesses the world's most advanced scientific and technological forces and a highly developed socialist culture. It has built the world's first industrial atomic power station and accumulated rich experience in the peaceful use of atomic energy. The world's largest power-generating capacity Kuibyshev power station has recently been fully completed and is now fully generating electricity. After successfully testing intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union successfully launched two artificial satellites, opening a new chapter for mankind's scientific research. In terms of agricultural production, it has also achieved great success. It not only has a socialist collectivized agriculture with the highest degree of mechanization, but also the output of many products ranks first in the world. As people's incomes continue to increase and prices have been repeatedly reduced, people's living standards have been greatly and generally improved. These brilliant achievements fully demonstrate that the socialist system contains amazing vitality and has incomparable superiority, setting a valuable and glorious example for the people of the world.

The light of the October Socialist Revolution illuminates the road to human liberation. Due to the influence of the October Revolution, the people's revolutionary movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries have risen up. The situation in China is also the same. The Chinese revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is advancing along the road pointed out by the October Socialist Revolution. Therefore, the victory of the Chinese revolutionary struggle and the development of construction are the continuation of the October Socialist Revolution.

The vast number of overseas Chinese have a glorious tradition of loving their motherland. They eagerly hoped that their motherland could get rid of the aggression of imperialists and the rule of reactionary forces as soon as possible and embark on the road to prosperity and happiness. Therefore, when Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the Xinhai Revolution, many overseas Chinese became enthusiastic supporters and supporters of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and repeatedly supported Mr. Sun Yat-sen economically and in practical actions. The revolutionary struggle led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen suffered many failures. While he was exploring the road forward, the October Revolution took place. Then, in 1921, the Communist Party of China was established. He carefully studied the influence of the Russian Revolution and the road that the Chinese Revolution should take, and was greatly inspired. He came to the conclusion that "the Chinese revolution will not succeed without learning from Russia." Therefore, he put forward the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants. Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away in 1925. Before his death, he was still thinking about how to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. In his famous letter to the Soviet Union, he wrote: "Dear comrades! As I bid farewell to you, I would like to express my fervent hope that the dawn will soon break, when the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally! The two countries will join hands in the great battle for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory."

Overseas Chinese, like their compatriots at home, hope that the motherland will soon reach the realm of prosperity and happiness. Today, under the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and under the brilliant light of the October Revolution, the people of the whole country have achieved great achievements that they could not have dreamed of in the past. The motherland has become strong, the level of industrial and agricultural production has been unprecedentedly improved, and people's lives are constantly improving. At this moment of welcoming the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, we must firmly remember that we must learn better from our good teacher and helpful friend—the Soviet Union—and cooperate closely to defend world peace and build a socialist motherland.

    苏联永远是我们的良师益友
    中华全国归国华侨联合会主席　陈嘉庚
    十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念即将来临。我全国人民和海外华侨同全世界劳动人民一样，莫不怀着无限兴奋和感激的心情来迎接这个伟大的节日。
    十月革命前的俄国，经济落后，文盲众多。可是现在的苏联，已成为世界上第一流的工业大国。工业发展的速度已远远超过美、英、法等资本主义国家，而且拥有世界上最先进的科学技术力量和高度发展的社会主义文化。它建成了世界上第一个工业用的原子能发电站，并在和平利用原子能方面积累了丰富的经验；世界上发电能力最大的古比雪夫发电站，最近已全部建成，并已全部发电；苏联在继洲际弹道导弹试验成功之后，又成功地发射出两颗人造卫星，揭开了人类对科学研究的新的一页。在农业生产方面，也获得了伟大的成绩。它不但有了社会主义集体化了的机械化程度最高的农业，并且许多产品的产量已高踞世界首位。由于人民的收入不断增加，物价又屡次降低，人民的生活水平有了大大地普遍提高。这些辉煌的成就，充分说明社会主义制度蕴藏着惊人的生命力和有着无可比拟的优越性，为全世界人民树立了可贵的光辉的榜样。
    十月社会主义革命的光辉照耀着人类解放的道路。由于十月革命的影响，殖民地、半殖民地国家的人民革命运动高涨起来。中国的情况也是如此。在中国共产党领导下的中国革命，是沿着十月社会主义革命所指出的道路前进的。所以，中国革命斗争的胜利和建设事业的发展，就是十月社会主义革命的继续。
    我国广大的海外华侨，有着热爱祖国的光荣传统。他们切盼自己的祖国能够早日摆脱帝国主义者的侵略和反动势力的统治，走上富强康乐之途，所以在孙中山先生倡导辛亥革命时，很多华侨都成了孙中山先生的热烈拥护者和支持者，在经济上和实际行动上再接再厉地支援孙中山先生。孙中山先生所领导的革命斗争，前后曾遭受许多次失败，他在摸索前进的道路时，十月革命发生了，接着，1921年中国共产党成立了，他注意地研究了俄国革命的影响和中国革命应走的道路，得到了很大的启发，得出了“中国革命非以俄为师断无成就”的结论。因而提出了联俄、联共、扶助工农的三大政策。1925年孙中山先生逝世了，在他临终以前，还念念不忘于如何加强中苏两国人民的友谊。在他致苏联的有名的遗书中写道：“亲爱的同志！当此与你们诀别之际，我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国！两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”
    海外华侨和国内同胞一样，希望祖国早登富强康乐之域。今天，全国人民在中国共产党英明正确领导下，在十月革命的光辉照耀下，已经取得了过去所梦想不到的伟大成就。祖国已经强盛，工农业生产水平空前提高，人民生活也在不断改善。在这迎接十月革命四十周年的时刻，我们应该牢牢记住，今后必须更好地向我们的良师益友——苏联学习，并且密切合作，为保卫世界和平、建设社会主义祖国而奋斗。
