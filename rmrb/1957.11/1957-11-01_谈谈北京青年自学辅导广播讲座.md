Talking about Beijing Youth Self-Study Tutoring Broadcast Lectures
    Liu Rui

    In order to help junior middle school graduates who have not gone on to further education and who are not yet able to participate in labor production, the Beijing Education Bureau and Beijing People's Broadcasting Station have jointly launched the "Beijing Youth Self-Study Tutoring Broadcast Lectures." Through the guidance of these lectures, these junior middle school graduates can conduct self-study in a guided and planned manner.

    The "Beijing Youth Self-Study Tutoring Broadcast Lectures" this semester offers three courses: Politics, Chinese Language, and Algebra. The Politics course mainly provides students with socialist ideological education. This semester will cover the anti-Rightist struggle, and next semester we plan to teach some parts of the newly compiled first-year high school politics textbook. The Chinese Language course continues to improve students' reading and expression abilities (including practical writing skills) based on existing junior middle school literature and Chinese language; and through the transmission of Chinese language knowledge, ideological and political education, especially labor education, is carried out in a planned and purposeful manner. The teaching materials are selected from books, periodicals, magazines, newspapers, and current teaching materials. At the same time, "Self-Study Guidance" is compiled lesson by lesson based on the selected works as a reference for self-study. In Algebra, it is required that after a year of study, students' algebraic knowledge and calculation ability should be improved to a level roughly equivalent to that of first-year high school students. In order to help students who plan to take the high school entrance examination next summer to review their lessons, we plan to add some review lectures on junior middle school literature, Chinese language, and junior middle school mathematics next semester.

    This broadcast lecture began broadcasting on October 15th on Beijing People's Broadcasting Station's 1350 kilocycle frequency. There are two classes every day, each lasting fifty minutes. The broadcasting time is from 8:30 to 10:20 every Monday to Friday morning. In order to take care of listeners who cannot listen during the day or have difficulty listening, the courses taught the previous day are replayed every Tuesday to Saturday evening from 8:00 to 9:50.

    According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 3,500 listeners to the broadcast lectures. Among them, more than 2,000 are junior middle school graduates, and more than 1,000 are young people working in factories, mines, government agencies, and the military. Some of them listen collectively, and some listen individually in a scattered manner. Since the start of the classes two weeks ago, the listeners have responded very well. They have written to the broadcast lecture office one after another, expressing their confidence in learning well.

    Using radio for broadcast teaching has many benefits. First, it saves manpower. One teacher lecturing on the radio can be listened to by many people, which solves some of the current difficulties in the lack of tutoring teachers. In addition, it can save material resources. Because students can listen to classes in a scattered manner, there is no need for dedicated school buildings.

    谈谈北京青年自学辅导广播讲座
    刘锐
    为了帮助没有升学，同时又没有条件立即参加劳动生产的初中毕业生继续学习，北京市教育局和北京人民广播电台联合举办了“北京青年自学辅导广播讲座”。通过这个讲座的辅导，使这些初中毕业生能够在有指导、有计划的情况下进行自学。
    “北京青年自学辅导广播讲座”这学期开讲政治、语文、代数三门课程。政治课主要是向学生进行社会主义思想教育。这学期讲反右派斗争，下学期准备讲授新编高中一年级政治教材的某些部分。语文课是在已有的初中文学、汉语的基础上，继续提高学生的阅读能力和表达能力（包括实用的文字能力）；并且通过语文知识的传授，有计划有目的地进行思想政治教育，特别是劳动教育。教材是从书刊、杂志、报纸和现行教材中选择的。同时根据选择的作品，逐课编写了“自学指导”，作为自学的参考。在代数课方面，要求经过一年的学习，使学生的代数知识和运算能力提高到大体相当高中一年级的程度。为了帮助明年暑假打算投考高中的学生复习功课，下学期准备增开一些关于初中文学、汉语和初中数学的复习课讲座。
    这个广播讲座已于10月15日在北京人民广播电台1350千周波开始播音。每天两节课，每节课五十分钟。播送的时间是每星期一至星期五上午八点三十分至十点二十分。为了照顾白天不能收听或收听有困难的听众，每星期二至星期六晚间八点至九点五十分重播一次前一天讲过的课程。
    据不完全的统计，收听广播讲座的听众有三千五百多人。其中有两千多人是初中毕业生，另一千多人是厂矿、机关、部队的在职青年。他们有的是集体收听，有的是个人分散收听。开课两周以来，听众的反映很好。他们纷纷写信给广播讲座办公室，表示他们有学好的信心。
    利用电台进行广播教学有很多好处。首先是节省人力。一个教师在广播电台讲课，很多人都可以收听，这就解决了当前缺乏辅导师资的一部分困难。另外，可以节省物力。因为学生可以分散听课，不需要什么专用校舍。
