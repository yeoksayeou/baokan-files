    Master Chen's Secret
    Yang Zilang
    One evening, veteran bricklayer Master Chen spent eighty cents to buy a book of the most beautiful stationery. Someone asked him: What are you going to do with such beautiful stationery? Master Chen smiled and said, "Keep the secret for now." Mischievous Little Zhang had already let the air out, saying that Master Chen's eldest daughter was getting married soon, and Master Chen had received a letter from his future son-in-law, so he bought the most beautiful stationery to write back to the new son-in-law. The next day, Master Chen's apprentice, Little Xun, spread another piece of news, saying that Master Chen bought the new stationery to ask someone to write a Russian letter to a friend in the Soviet Union. Does Master Chen really have friends in the Soviet Union?
    With a sense of curiosity, I went to Master Chen's house to take a look. As soon as I entered, I saw Master Chen, holding a photo in his hand, admiring it with his old wife. I stepped closer and saw that it was a new four-inch photo of himself, just picked up from the photo studio. I said, "Master Chen, can the secret of you buying stationery the other day be revealed now?" Master Chen smiled and said, "You young people always like to get to the bottom of things. Here! This is the secret." At that time, I took two brand-new sheets of stationery from Master Chen's hand, which were filled with crooked Russian characters. I hurriedly asked Master Chen, "Do you really have friends in the Soviet Union?" Master Chen smiled and said, "I haven't been to the Soviet Union, how would I have friends there?" "Then why are you writing to them?" I asked strangely again. Master Chen said, "The reason for writing letters is that we learned the Korolyov method this year and achieved great results, so I am writing a letter and sending a photo of myself to him before the October Revolution Day to thank and congratulate him..."

    陈师傅的秘密
    杨子浪
    一天晚上，老瓦工陈师傅花了八角钱买了一本最漂亮的信纸。有人问他：买这么漂亮的信纸干啥？陈师傅笑着说：“保守秘密暂时不谈。”调皮的小张早就把空气放开了，他说陈师傅的大女儿最近准备结婚，陈师傅收到了女婿的一封信，买最漂亮的信纸是为了给新女婿写回信的。第二天，陈师傅的徒弟小荀又传出了另外一个消息，说是陈师傅买新信纸是准备请人写俄文信寄给苏联的一个朋友。难道陈师傅在苏联还有朋友吗？
    我怀着一种好奇心，去到陈师傅家里看看，一进门就看见陈师傅，手里拿了一张照片，和他的老伴站在一块欣赏着。我走近前一看，原来是他自己一张刚从相馆取回来的四寸大的新照片。我说：“陈师傅你前天买信纸的秘密能公开了吧？”陈师傅笑着说：“你们年轻人遇事总喜追根问底的。喏！这就是秘密。”当时，我从陈师傅手里接过两张崭新的信纸，那上面尽写的是弯弯扭扭的俄文字。我急忙问陈师傅：“你在苏联真的有朋友吗？”陈师傅笑着说：“我又没有去苏联，哪儿有苏联的朋友。”“那你为啥给他们写信呢？”我奇怪地复问。陈师傅说：“写信的问题呀，那是因为咱们今年学习了科罗廖夫工作法，获得了很大的成绩，所以我在十月革命节前写封信寄一张我自己的照片去向他感谢与祝贺……”
