    ACFTU Notice
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions Notice on Organizing Workers and Staff to Discuss the Four Drafts of the State Council's Interim Provisions on Retirement of Workers and Staff
    On November 20th, the State Council announced four draft regulations, including the "Interim Provisions on the Retirement of Workers and Staff," and requested that, in conjunction with the rectification campaign, workers and staff be organized to discuss them. Trade union organizations at all levels should actively assist the government and enterprise administrations in carrying out this work.
    Labor wages and labor insurance welfare issues are major issues concerning the lives of the broad masses of people, and they are also major issues that reflect the relationship between socialist production and distribution. We believe that after these four regulations have been discussed by workers and staff, and after the State Council has further researched and revised them for final approval and implementation, they will further promote the improvement of labor wages and labor insurance welfare work, and bring many benefits to China's socialist construction.
    When organizing workers and staff to discuss, it is necessary to fully utilize the forms of "big blooming, big contending, big-character posters," and adopt methods such as presenting the situation, explaining the principles, calculating detailed accounts, and recalling comparisons, so that workers and staff can truly understand the basic principles stipulated by the central government of starting from 600 million people, taking overall consideration, and making appropriate arrangements, and understand the correct relationship between production and life, workers and peasants, and within the working class. Trade union organizations at all levels should organize workers and staff to participate in this discussion with a high sense of responsibility.
    In addition to conducting propaganda and explanation to workers and staff, trade union organizations should also pay attention to collecting the opinions and demands of workers and staff in the discussion. The federations of trade unions of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government should summarize and report the situation and opinions of workers and staff discussions to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions around December 20th.

    全总通知
    中华全国总工会关于组织职工讨论国务院关于工人、职员退休处理暂行规定等四个草案的通知
    11月20日国务院公布了关于工人、职员退休处理暂行规定等四个草案，并要求结合整风，组织职工进行讨论。工会各级组织应该积极地协助政府和企业行政进行这项工作。
    劳动工资和劳保福利问题，是关系着广大人民生活的重大问题，也是体现社会主义生产和分配之间的关系的重大问题。我们相信，这四个规定经过职工讨论，并经国务院再加研究修改定案付诸实施后，将会进一步推动劳动工资和劳保福利工作的改善，给我国社会主义建设事业带来很多益处。
    在组织职工讨论的时候，要充分运用大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报等形式，采取摆情况、讲道理、算细账、回忆对比等方法，使职工真正理解中央所规定的从六亿人口出发、统筹兼顾、适当安排的基本方针，理解生产与生活、工人与农民以及工人阶级内部的正确关系。工会各级组织应当组织职工以高度的责任心踊跃地参加这次讨论。
    工会组织除了向职工进行宣传解释之外，还应当注意汇集职工在讨论中的意见与要求。各省、自治区、直辖市工会联合会应将职工讨论的情况和意见，于12月20日前后汇总报告全国总工会。
