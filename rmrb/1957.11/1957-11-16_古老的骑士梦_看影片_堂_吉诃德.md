	The Ancient Knight's Dream
	——Watching the Film "Don Quixote"
	Yimo
	In my own childhood, I had a particular fondness for wuxia (martial arts) novels. Naturally, this kind of fondness would be considered a spiritual harm to today's children. However, in the old society, some of the better works among them were truly "spiritual food" that children loved, compared to textbooks that directly instilled political toxins. How many simple hearts once yearned for the actions of chivalrous heroes who helped the poor and rescued the distressed, and how many children once harbored fervent dreams of carrying knapsacks to Shaolin or Mount Emei to learn martial arts. Although only a little over a dozen years have passed, it is already a very laughable matter for today's young protagonists. They live in a completely different era, they have abundant socialist and beautiful ideals as spiritual food, and in their pure emotions, there is no longer the illusion of chivalrous behavior; what excites their ideals is how to be a Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, or Luo Shengjiao who defends the socialist motherland.

	However, even in the past, this issue was never simply a matter of the influence of wuxia novels; it also contained shadows cast on the minds of children by real life – they saw the injustice and oppression in real life and wanted to solve it through chivalrous struggles. Therefore, from these naive and laughable events, one can also see that inhuman injustice and oppression, even in young hearts, can ignite the torch of resistance.

	To get back to the main topic, I said such a lengthy introduction only because of some random thoughts that came to mind after watching the Soviet widescreen film "Don Quixote." In the past, literary historians and critics, when commenting on the Spanish great writer Cervantes' novel "Don Quixote," mostly focused on analyzing the era background and cultural conditions that produced this typical character, as well as the comedic side of Don Quixote's contradictory character. But the noble human qualities manifested in his comedic character were rarely noticed. I feel that the film's screenwriter, E. Schwartz, developed the spirit of the original work in this respect, prominently showing Don Quixote's heartfelt humanistic feelings in a series of comedic scenes.

	Don Quixote, this Spanish gentleman whose mind was filled with outdated chivalrous adventure stories, due to his bizarre ideas, saw windmills and wine bladders as cunning giants, sheep as armies, traveling monks as sorcerers who robbed princesses, and criminal prisoners as suffering slaves. He relentlessly fought against the enemies in his imaginary illusions. Despite the hardships that Don Quixote and his squire Sancho endured for these adventurous actions, and even almost losing their lives, they never retreated and moved forward courageously. Don Quixote's adventurous actions carried out with his imaginary illusions are naturally demented, crazy, and ridiculous, but they did not submerge his character traits. On the contrary, it is precisely through a series of laughable dialogues and actions that his excellent qualities are vividly expressed. Don Quixote strictly adheres to the moral principles of an ideal knight – a firm belief in justice and chastity towards love, and his heroic actions are filled with fearless spirit, especially the deep friendship between him and his squire Sancho, which is even more richly imbued with charming comedic effects. Although the film concentrates and summarizes the comedic scenes in the novel, it highlights these characteristics in the essential nature of Don Quixote's character.

	When watching the film, just like reading Cervantes' novel, these comedic scenes constantly aroused laughter from the audience. Although this shows the profound satirical power towards chivalrous literature and the delusional character of Don Quixote, the content of this laughter is completely different from the laughter after watching "The Inspector General." Behind the laughter, there is also infinite sympathy. As I said above, the audience's attitude towards Don Quixote is just like the feelings of children in the old days who yearned for the chivalrous behavior of helping the poor and rescuing the distressed. The ancient knight's dream in the film, and the image of Don Quixote, can better evoke genuine and humanistic new fantasies from the comedic feelings.

    古老的骑士梦
    ——看影片“堂·吉诃德”
    伊默
    我自己的童年时代，对于武侠小说有一种特殊的嗜好。自然这种嗜好，对于今天的儿童说来，已经是一种精神上的戕害。但是，在旧社会，它们中间的一些较好的作品，比起直接灌输政治毒素的教科书，却是真正为儿童所喜爱的“精神食粮”。有多少单纯的心灵曾经向往过济困扶危的侠客行为，又有多少孩子曾经怀着热烈的梦想背着行囊想投少林寺或峨嵋山去学艺。这一切，时间虽然不过十几年，而对于今天的小主人公来说，却已经是一件非常可笑的事。他们生活在完全另一个时代了，他们有着丰富的社会主义美好理想的精神食粮，在他们的纯洁的感情里，不再有侠客行为的幻觉；激动着他们理想的，是如何去做一个保卫社会主义祖国的董存瑞、黄继光、罗盛教。
    不过，就是在过去，这样的问题，也绝不单单是一个武侠小说的影响问题，其中也有着实生活在孩子的心灵中所投下的暗影——他们看到了现实生活中的不平和压迫，却想用侠客斗争的方式去解决。因此，从这种幼稚的、可笑的事件里，人们也能看出，违反人性的不平和压迫，即使在幼小的心灵里，也会点燃起反抗的火炬。
    书归正传，我说了这样一段冗长的开场白，只不过是由于看了苏联宽银幕影片“堂·吉诃德”所联想到的一些杂感。过去的文学史家和文学批评家，在评论西班牙伟大作家塞万提斯的小说“吉诃德先生传”的时候，大部分注意力都在于分析产生这个典型人物的时代背景、文化条件，以及堂·吉诃德矛盾性格的喜剧性的一面。而从他的喜剧性的性格里所表现出来的高贵的人类品质，却很少被人注意到。我觉得影片编剧E·施瓦尔兹却在这方面发展了原作的精神，在一连串喜剧性的场面上，突出地表现了堂·吉诃德出自内心的人道主义感情。
    堂·吉诃德，这个脑子里装满了陈旧的游侠冒险故事的西班牙绅士，由于他的怪诞的念头，把风车、酒囊看作狡猾的巨人，把羊群当作军队，把旅行的僧人看作劫夺公主的魔法师，把犯罪的囚徒看作受难的奴隶，对于他的虚妄幻觉中的敌人，进行了无情的搏斗。尽管为了这些冒险的行动，堂·吉诃德和他的侍从桑科吃尽了苦头，甚至险些送掉了性命，他们却从不后退，一往直前。堂·吉诃德这种凭虚妄的幻觉所进行的冒险行动，自然是神智不清，疯狂可笑的，但却没有淹没他的性格特色。恰恰相反，正是透过一连串的可笑的对话和行动，鲜明地表现出了他的优秀品德。堂·吉诃德严守着一个理想武士的道德原则——对正义的坚信，和对爱情的贞洁，并且在他的英雄行为里，充满了无畏的精神，尤其是他和他的侍从桑科的深厚的友谊，更富有诱人的喜剧效果。影片虽然集中概括了小说中的喜剧性场面，却在堂·吉诃德的性格本质上，突出了这些特色。
    看影片的时候，像看塞万提斯的小说一样，这些喜剧性的场面，不断地激起观众的哄笑。这虽然显示了对于骑士文学和堂·吉诃德虚妄幻想的性格的深刻的讽刺力量，但是，这种笑的内容，绝不同于看了“钦差大臣”以后的笑。在笑的后面，还包含着无限的同情。像我在上面所说的，观众对待堂·吉诃德的态度，正像对待旧时代的孩子们向往济困扶危的侠客行为心情一样。影片中这古老的骑士梦，和堂·吉诃德的形象，更能使人们从喜剧性的感受里，唤起真挚的富有人情意味的新奇的幻想。
