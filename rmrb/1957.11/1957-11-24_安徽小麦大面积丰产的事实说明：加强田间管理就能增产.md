    The Fact That Anhui Wheat Has A Large Area of High Yield Shows:
    Strengthening Field Management Can Increase Production
    (Our report) This year, Anhui Province advocated the cultivation of large areas of high-yield wheat. As a result, 1,030,000 mu of wheat in 20 counties including Shou County and Fengyang along the Huaihe River and the south bank of the Huaihe River had an average yield per mu that was more than doubled compared to the local average wheat yield. The average yield of high-yield wheat was 208 jin, while the average wheat yield in these counties was only 100.1 jin. The reason for the high wheat yield was that field management was emphasized in the spring during cultivation. Among the 420,000 mu of high-yield wheat in the Bengbu area, fertilizer was universally applied once in mid-to-late April, of which 340,000 mu were weeded. In addition, various places also carried out drought prevention, flood control, and pest and disease control for high-yield wheat. These high-yield measures are commonly mentioned general measures, but they were not implemented in other wheat fields, while they were implemented conscientiously in these high-yield wheat fields.
    Anhui Province's large-scale contiguous high yields and the fact that wheat yields can be increased by more than double under general technical conditions have greatly encouraged farmers to tap the potential for increased wheat production and are very persuasive. This autumn, all localities have strengthened leadership and expanded the area for cultivating high-yield wheat, generally accounting for more than 20% of the wheat area. These wheat fields have paid attention to deep plowing and meticulous harrowing, increased application of base fertilizer since this autumn sowing, and have begun to pay attention to field management since this winter. It is expected that there will be greater harvests next year. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee issued instructions this month, requiring all localities to continue to step up the work of cultivating large areas of high-yield wheat, requiring the average yield per mu of wheat in the province to be increased from about 100 jin this year to more than 150 jin.

### 安徽小麦大面积丰产的事实说明：加强田间管理就能增产

    安徽小麦大面积丰产的事实说明：
    加强田间管理就能增产
    本报讯　安徽省今年因为提倡培养小麦大面积丰产的结果，淮北及沿淮河南岸的寿县、凤阳等二十个县，有一百零三万亩小麦，平均每亩产量比当地的小麦平均产量提高了一倍以上。丰产小麦的平均产量是二百零八斤，而这些县的小麦平均产量才是一百点一斤。小麦丰产的原因是在培养时抓住了春季田间管理。蚌埠专区的四十二万亩丰产小麦中，在4月中下旬普遍追施了一次肥料，其中有三十四万亩锄了杂草，此外，各地对丰产小麦还作了防旱、防涝和防治病虫害等工作。这些丰产措施，都是经常提到的一般措施，只是在别的麦田里没有作到，而在这些丰产麦田里认真地作了。
    安徽省这种大面积连片丰产和在一般技术条件下提高小麦产量一倍以上的事实，对农民挖掘小麦增产潜力的鼓舞很大，说服力很强。今年秋种时，各地都加强了领导，扩大了培养丰产小麦的面积，一般都占到小麦面积的20％以上。这些小麦从今年秋种时即注意了深耕细耙，增施基肥，并从今冬起即开始注意进行田间管理，预计明年将可有更大收获。安徽省委于本月发出指示，要求各地继续加紧进行培养大面积丰产小麦的工作，要求把全省小麦的平均亩产量由今年的一百斤左右，提高到一百五十斤以上。
