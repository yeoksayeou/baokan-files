Xinhua News Agency, November 12th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese women who married Chinese men and returned to Japan to visit relatives in May of this year held a national representative meeting in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 11th. The meeting adopted a statement demanding that the Japanese government dispatch ships as soon as possible to send all Japanese women who are willing to return to China back to China.

The statement expressed firm opposition to the Japanese government's practice of dividing the more than 1,200 Japanese women returning to China into so-called "Japanese Resident" class (Japanese women who married Chinese in China) and "Overseas Chinese" class (Japanese wives of returned overseas Chinese residing in Japan), and only sending Japanese women belonging to the "Japanese Resident" class back to China. A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare has repeatedly stated that the Japanese government will use a British ship around the 20th of this month to send Japanese women belonging to the so-called "Japanese Resident" class back to China, while allowing Japanese women belonging to the so-called "Overseas Chinese" class to raise their own travel expenses to return to China.

On the afternoon of the 12th, representatives elected by the meeting visited Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and Minister of Health and Welfare Kamazo Horiki, and handed them the statement.

    返国探亲的日本妇女
    要求日政府把她们送回中国
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：在今年5月间回日本探亲的同中国人结婚的日本妇女，11日下午在东京举行了全国代表者会议。会议通过了一项声明，要求日本政府尽快派遣轮船，把所有愿意回到中国的日本妇女送回中国。
    声明表示坚决反对日本政府把回国探亲的一千二百多日本妇女分为所谓“日侨”班（在中国同中国人结婚的日本妇女）和“华侨”班（归国旅日华侨的日籍妻子），而只把属于“日侨”班的日本妇女送回中国的做法。日本政府厚生省发言人曾经一再表明，日本政府将在本月20日左右用英国轮船把属于所谓“日侨”班的日本妇女送回中国，而让属于所谓“华侨”班的日本妇女自己筹措旅费回中国去。
    12日下午，会议选出的代表访问了日本首相岸信介和厚生相堀木镰三，把声明书交给他们。
