The Development of Table Tennis

Table tennis was originally called billiards, because it started as a game played on dining tables. Because the ball made "ping, pong" sounds when hit back and forth on the table, billiards was also called table tennis. At that time, neither the ball nor the paddles had specific specifications. It was not until the end of the 14th century that celluloid balls were invented. Initially, paddles were made of parchment, and later they were made of wood. The emergence and widespread use of rubber paddles is a more recent development of the last two or three decades. In 1953, Japan first used sponge paddles, and later sponge paddles gradually became popular in various countries.

It is said that table tennis originated in China and Japan. Among European countries, Britain was the earliest country to import table tennis, which was then called "table lawn tennis." Because table tennis is easy to learn and has simple rules, it can be played by men, women, and children, making it an interesting and valuable exercise. It quickly spread to various countries.

In our country, the promotion of table tennis began only forty years ago. At that time, it was relatively popular only in large cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. Because wooden paddles were used at that time, and the ball was relatively light, the skill level was very low. It was not until 1937 that rubber paddles were available, and the weight of the ball was changed to be the same as that stipulated in international competitions. During competitions, chopping was also used to replace blocking, but the level at that time was still very low internationally.

In the years since liberation, table tennis skills have greatly improved as a result of its widespread promotion. After the first national table tennis competition was held in Beijing in 1952 to select the national team, in March of the following year, the team participated in the 20th World Table Tennis Championships held in Bucharest. The results at that time were not very good. The men's team was rated as tenth in the first division, and the women's team was rated as third in the second division. Since then, our country has participated in every World Table Tennis Championship, and the results have improved each time. In the 24th World Table Tennis Championships held in Stockholm this April, our men's and women's teams both won the group championships in the team events. After the competition, our men's team was rated as fourth in the first division, and the women's team was rated as third in the first division. Our table tennis team has become a world-class team.

After the establishment of the international table tennis organization in 1926, the first World Table Tennis Championships was held in London the following year. Since then, competitions have been held in various countries in turn every spring. This spring, the 24th International Table Tennis Championships was held in Stockholm (suspended from 1940 to 1946 due to the war), with representatives from thirty-eight countries and regions participating.

Among the countries of the world, Japanese athletes have won several world championships in a row. The table tennis teams of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania all use a penhold grip, are good at both offense and defense, and have also won several international competitions. (Guo An)

    乒乓球运动的发展
    乒乓球原叫台球，这是因为乒乓球在刚开始时只是在餐桌上玩的一种游戏。因为球在桌上来回打击时发出“乒、乓”的声音，所以又将台球叫做乒乓球。当时球和拍子都没有一定的规格，直到十四世纪末叶，才发明了用赛璐珞制造台球。最初，球拍是用羊皮纸做的，后来才改用木板制造。至于胶皮拍的产生和普遍运用还是最近二、三十年的事情。1953年，日本首先使用了海绵拍，以后海绵拍才逐渐在各国普遍使用。
    据说，乒乓球运动最初是从中国和日本开始的。在欧洲国家中，英国是乒乓球输入最早的国家，当时叫“桌上网球”。由于乒乓球简便易学、规则简单，男女老少都能打，因此乒乓球便成为一项有趣味和有锻炼价值的运动，并很快地流传到各国。
    在我国，乒乓球运动在四十年前才开始提倡，当时只有上海、南京、天津、广州等大城市比较普遍，由于当时都是用的木拍，球也比较轻，因此技术很低，直至1937年才有胶皮拍，球的重量也改成与国际比赛中规定的一样。在比赛时也开始用削球来代替挡球，但那时的水平在国际上还是很低。
    解放几年来，乒乓球运动由于广泛开展的结果，技术水平有了很大的提高。在1952年北京举行第一届全国乒乓球比赛选出国家队后，第二年3月便参加了在布加勒斯特举行的第二十届世界乒乓球锦标赛，当时的成绩并不很好，男子队被评为第一级十名，女子队被评为第二级第三名。以后我国参加了每届的世界乒乓球锦标赛，每次成绩都有所提高。今年4月在斯德哥尔摩举行的第二十四届乒乓球锦标赛中，我国男、女队在团体赛中都获得了分组冠军。比赛结束后，我国男子队被评为第一级第四名，女子队被评为第一级第三名，我国乒乓球队已成为世界第一流的球队。
    1926年国际性的乒乓球组织成立以后，第二年便在伦敦举行了第一次的世界乒乓球锦标赛。此后，每年春天便在各个国家轮流举办竞赛。今年春天在斯德哥尔摩举行了第二十四届国际乒乓球锦标赛（1940年到1946年因战争暂停），有三十八个国家和地区代表参加。
    在世界各国中，日本运动员接连取得了几届世界冠军。捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚等乒乓球队都是横握球拍，善守能攻，也曾获得几届国际比赛的冠军。　（国安）
