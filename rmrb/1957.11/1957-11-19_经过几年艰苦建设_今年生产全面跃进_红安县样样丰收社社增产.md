Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric: Hong'an County, Hubei Province, has made a great leap forward in agricultural production this year. The results of repeated yield calculations indicate that fifteen kinds of crops have achieved bumper harvests, and all seven hundred and thirty-two agricultural cooperatives have increased production.

The grain crops with the largest sown area in the county have been particularly productive this year. Its total output has increased by nearly 20% compared to last year's bumper harvest, and the unit area yield averages 834 jin, an increase of nearly 18% over last year. It has reached the highest grain yield target in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. At the same time, a large number of models of high-yield and large-area high-yield have emerged in the county's grain crops.

In addition to grain crops, other crops and animal husbandry in the county have also developed rapidly this year. Among them, peanut production increased by more than 25% compared with last year, cotton production increased by more than half compared with last year, and livestock such as pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, and rabbits have increased by one to two times compared with last year (only cattle increased by 7.6% compared with last year).

This year is the second year of full collectivization in Hong'an County. In the first year after collectivization, 90% of the seven hundred and thirty-two cooperatives, accounting for more than 99% of the total number of farmers, increased production, but 10% of the cooperatives did not increase production or even reduced production. This year, all cooperatives in the county have increased production, of which 106 cooperatives increased production by 30% to 50%, and 19 cooperatives increased production by more than 50%. It is particularly worth pointing out that the production of more than 91% of the seven hundred and thirty-two cooperatives in the county has reached or exceeded the level of local wealthy middle peasants.

As a result of the great leap forward in agriculture and the great development of sideline occupations, the income of farmers and the public accumulation of cooperatives in Hong'an County have increased significantly this year. The total income of farmers in the county from agriculture and sideline occupations this year increased by about one-third compared with last year. According to a survey of ten cooperatives, the public accumulation of these cooperatives has increased this year. Some cooperatives have increased production particularly significantly, and the income of members is relatively large, with public accumulation accounting for about 33% of the total income. The facts of increased production and increased income have greatly stimulated the patriotic enthusiasm of the farmers. For example, the task of collecting public grain in the county this year was completed more than a month ahead of schedule; the surplus grain sold by farmers increased by nearly one time compared with last year; and the time for farmers to subscribe to public bonds was shortened from four months last year to more than ten days, and the subscription amount was even larger than last year.

The bumper harvest in Hong'an County this year is the result of the county's farmers waging a tenacious struggle against natural disasters under the leadership of the Party and the government, and carrying out a series of reforms in farming techniques. The county's farmers once waged a successful struggle against a continuous drought of eighty days. In this struggle, an average of more than 90,000 people were mobilized every day, and more than 15,000 waterwheels were mobilized for drought resistance, in addition to a large number of water-carrying buckets and more than ten water pumps. In some places, eighty, ninety, or even two hundred waterwheels were connected together to draw water, so that the water could climb over high mountains and irrigate water-deficient fields on the mountains and on the other side of the mountains. In terms of farming technology reform, in addition to generally increasing fertilizer application on more than 400,000 mu of paddy fields and dry land in the county, and carrying out soil improvement on tens of thousands of mu of fields and land with very poor soil quality, the techniques of deep plowing and close planting were also vigorously promoted in major crops such as rice, peanuts, and cotton, and field management was strengthened. In addition, the county also massively promoted single-season late japonica rice and double-cropping rice in rice production this year, and promoted the Dai character cotton variety in cotton production, which also played a significant role in the high yield of rice and cotton.

In order to organize a large-scale agricultural and sideline production movement, under the unified leadership of the Hong'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the county transferred one hundred and several dozen county and district cadres to rural areas last winter and this spring to strengthen grassroots leadership; under the personal leadership of Cheng Peng, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, more than one thousand rural work cadres in the county adopted the method of cultivating experimental fields, participated in production and led production, studied agricultural technology, enriched leadership experience; and consistently adhered to the so-called "four grasps" working method of grasping key points, grasping new things, grasping backward links, and grasping the overall situation, and used various opportunities to carry out socialist propaganda and education work to cadres and the masses.

Hong'an County is an old revolutionary base area, and a Soviet regime was established as early as 1927. After the failure of the Great Revolution, the farmers of this county carried out heroic struggles against the reactionary rulers, and the struggles in some areas continued until liberation. During these years, the productive forces of this old revolutionary base area were severely damaged, and the countryside was desolate. By the time of liberation, the county's grain yield had dropped from 600 jin per mu at its peak to more than 300 jin; peanut production had dropped even more. However, after several years of arduous construction, especially after this year's comprehensive great leap forward, the face of the county has been completely changed.

### 经过几年艰苦建设　今年生产全面跃进  红安县样样丰收社社增产

    经过几年艰苦建设　今年生产全面跃进
    红安县样样丰收社社增产
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省红安县今年的农业生产跃进了一大步。反复核算产量的结果指明：十五种农作物都获得了丰收，七百三十二个农业合作社都增加了生产。
    这个县播种面积最大的粮食作物今年的丰产情况很突出。它的总产量比丰收的去年增加了将近两成，单位面积产量平均八百三十四斤，比去年增加近18％，已提前达到了全国农业发展纲要修正草案的粮食产量最高指标。同时，在全县的粮食作物方面还涌现了大量的高额丰产和大面积丰产的典范。
    除了粮食作物外，这个县的其他农作物和畜牧业在今年也发展得很快。其中花生比去年增产达二成半以上，棉花比去年增产一半以上，猪、羊、鸡、鸭、兔等家畜都比去年增长了一倍到两倍（只有牛比去年增长7．6％）。
    今年是红安县全面合作化后的第二年。在合作化后的头一年内，占农户总数99％强的七百三十二个合作社，有90％的社增加了生产，但也有10％的社没有增产甚至减产。今年，全县所有的合作社都增产了，其中有一百零六个社增产30％到50％，有十九个社增产50％以上。特别值得指出的是：全县七百三十二个社中，91％以上的生产已经达到和超过了当地富裕中农的水平。
    由于农业大跃进和副业大发展的结果，今年红安县农民收入和合作社公共积累都显著增加。全县农民今年的农、副业总收入比去年增加了约三分之一。据对十个合作社的调查，今年这些社的公共积累都增加了。有的社增产特别显著，社员收入较多，公共积累约占总收入的33％左右。增加生产和增加收入的事实大大地激发了农民的爱国热情。例如全县今年征收公粮的任务比计划提前一个多月完成；农民交售的余粮比去年增加了将近一倍；农民认购公债的时间由去年的四个月缩短到十多天，而且认购数字比去年还大。
    今年红安县的大丰收，是全县农民在党和政府的领导下，向自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，和在耕作技术上进行了一系列的改革的结果。全县农民曾经向持续八十天的旱灾进行过胜利的斗争。在这个斗争中，每天平均出动九万多人，动员抗旱工具仅水车就有一万五千多部，另外还有大量的挑水桶和十多台抽水机。有的地方用八、九十部水车甚至二百多部水车连在一起车水，使水翻越高山，灌溉山上和山那面的缺水田地。在耕作技术改革方面，除在全县四十多万亩水田和旱地上普遍地增施了肥料，并且对几万亩土质很差的田、地进行了土壤改良外，还大力地在水稻、花生、棉花等主要作物中推行了深耕、密植的技术，加强了田间管理工作。此外，这个县今年在水稻方面大量地推广了一季晚粳和双季稻，在棉花方面推广了岱字棉品种，对稻、棉的丰产也起了极大的作用。
    为了组织大规模的农业、副业生产运动，在中共红安县委的统一领导下，这个县曾在去冬今春先后调出一百几十名县、区干部下放到农村中去，充实基层领导力量；在县委第一书记程鹏的亲自带头下，全县有一千多名农村工作干部，采用培育试验田的方法，参加生产和领导生产，钻研农业技术，丰富了领导经验；并且一贯地坚持实行了抓重点、抓新事物、抓落后环节、抓全面的所谓“四抓”的工作方法，并利用各种时机向干部和群众进行了社会主义的宣传教育工作。
    红安县是革命老根据地，早在1927年就曾建立过苏维埃政权。大革命失败后，这个县的农民曾经同反动统治者进行过英勇的斗争，有些地区的斗争一直坚持到解放。在这些年代里，这个革命老根据地的生产力受到了严重的破坏，农村中一片荒凉，到解放时，这个县的粮食产量已经由最盛时期的亩产六百斤下降到三百多斤；花生产量下降得更多。但是，经过几年的艰苦建设，特别是今年的全面大跃进后，这个县的面貌已经完全改观了。
