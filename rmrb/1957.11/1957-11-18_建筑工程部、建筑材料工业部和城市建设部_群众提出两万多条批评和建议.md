Xinhua News Agency report:

    A high tide of rectification and airing of views has emerged in the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, and the Ministry of Urban Construction. The staff of these three ministries have, through means such as big-character posters and symposiums, raised a total of more than 20,000 criticisms and suggestions regarding various aspects of their respective departments' work and leadership style.

    Many big-character posters put up by the staff criticized the shortcomings of leaders at all levels in implementing business guidelines and major measures. One big-character poster from the Ministry of Building Materials Industry criticized the ministry's leadership for lacking investigation and research into the production and demand of cement, resulting in fluctuating production plans and causing significant losses to enterprises. Another big-character poster pointed out that this year's asbestos resources were insufficient, but the leadership demanded increased asbestos production, which seriously affected the production of some enterprises, resulting in low product quality and increased waste. Some big-character posters from the Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Urban Construction pointed out that the central government's 1955 instructions on reducing the cost of non-productive construction, as well as major measures such as construction land quotas, housing standards, and the number of floors in buildings, were not seriously studied by the bureau. Some big-character posters from the Public Utilities Bureau of this ministry pointed out that after the National Capital Construction Conference in 1956, the State Council issued decisions to strengthen planning work, strengthen the construction industry, and strengthen urban construction work. These decisions were closely related to the business of the Public Utilities Bureau, but the bureau chief did not organize relevant units and personnel to study them seriously. Later, when the State Council conducted inspections, some people were temporarily pulled together to fabricate some information. Some big-character posters from the Finance Department of the Ministry of Construction Engineering also criticized the ministry's leadership for not paying attention to the implementation of advanced management systems such as "economic activity analysis and team economic accounting."

    Many big-character posters sharply criticized the shortcomings of some leading cadres in their work style and ideological style and demanded that they seriously correct them through this rectification movement. The staff of the Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute of the Ministry of Urban Construction posted dozens of big-character posters criticizing a deputy director for being "arrogant" and "lacking a sense of collectivism." Some big-character posters from the Ministry of Construction Engineering criticized the bureaucratic work style of some directors and deputy directors for not raising specific requirements in advance to dispatched work teams, not giving specific instructions during the work process, and not properly listening to reports after the work was completed.

    Many big-character posters also exposed shortcomings in organizational structure, office work systems, labor wages, and welfare systems. Some big-character posters from the Ministry of Building Materials Industry pointed out that after the establishment of this ministry, the number of enterprises did not increase, but the number of institutions and personnel nearly doubled. Due to the large size of the institutions, the work of some departments was duplicated, affecting the improvement of work efficiency. Some staff members of the North China Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering posted big-character posters entitled "Why are so many section chiefs assigned to our section?" saying that the section had a total of 17 people, of whom 7 were section chiefs, almost one leader leading one person. For example, the Planning and Supply Section had five and a half people working last year, but there were three section chiefs. When there was a problem to report to the section chief, they often pushed it back and forth. Some big-character posters written by staff members of the Ministry of Urban Construction pointed out that due to the unsound system for receiving, sending, and keeping documents and materials within the office, many documents were found to be backlogged, delayed, irresponsible, lost, misplaced, or misdelivered during the transfer and processing process. Some big-character posters pointed out that due to the chaos in the office's administrative management work, a total of 2,700 pieces of glass were damaged, more than 4,000 pieces of tableware were broken and lost, and 240 locks and keys were lost in more than a year. Some staff members of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry wrote big-character posters criticizing the shortcomings in the use and promotion of cadres, believing that some cadres who should not have been promoted were promoted, and some who should not have been upgraded were upgraded. A characteristic of these big-character posters is that there are many opinions criticizing unreasonable labor wages and welfare systems, but very few opinions requesting improved welfare benefits.

    Recently, these three ministries have taken specific measures to further mobilize the masses to air their views and have organized forces to study the various issues raised by the masses, preparing to gradually deal with them in batches.

    建筑工程部、建筑材料工业部和城市建设部
    群众提出两万多条批评和建议
    新华社讯　建筑工程部、建筑材料工业部和城市建设部三个部出现了整改的鸣放高潮。这三个部的工作人员，已经通过大字报、座谈会等方式，分别对本部门的各项工作和领导作风等方面提出了共两万多条的批评和建议。
    工作人员们贴出的许多大字报，批评了各级领导上贯彻执行业务方针和重大措施方面的缺点。建筑材料工业部的一张大字报，批评部的领导上对水泥的生产和需要情况缺乏调查研究，生产计划左右摇摆，造成企业生产上的很大损失。另一张大字报提出，今年的石棉资源不足，但是领导上要求石棉增产，结果使有些企业的生产受到严重影响，产品质量低，废品增多。城市建设部规划局有些大字报提出，1955年中央关于降低非生产性建筑造价的指示，以及建设用地定额、住宅标准、房屋层数等重大措施，局里都没有认真研究。这个部公用局的一些大字报提出，1956年全国基本建设会议以后，国务院曾经发布了加强计划工作、加强建筑工业和关于城市建设工作等的决定，这些决定和公用局的业务有很大关系，但是局长并没有组织有关单位和有关人员认真研究，后来国务院进行检查时，才临时抽人拼凑了一些情况。建筑工程部财务司有些大字报，也批评了部的领导上对贯彻
  “经济活动分析和班组经济核算”等先进的管理制度不重视。
    许多大字报尖锐地批评了一些领导干部在工作作风和思想作风方面的缺点，并且要求他们通过这次整风运动认真地加以改正。城市建设部的给排水设计院的工作人员，曾经贴出几十张大字报，批评一个副院长“自高自大”、“缺乏集体观念”等缺点。建筑工程部有些大字报，批评一些司局长对派出的工作组事先不提具体要求、工作进行中不给具体指示、工作做完了也不好好听取汇报的官僚主义作风。
    许多大字报还揭发了组织机构、机关工作制度、劳动工资和生活福利制度等方面的缺点。建筑材料工业部有些大字报提出，这个部成立后，企业数量并未增加，但机构和人员却增加了近一倍。由于机构庞大，某些部门的工作形成重复，影响工作效率的提高。建筑工程部华北工程管理局的一些工作人员，以“为什么我们处配备这样多的科长”为题贴出大字报说，这个处共十七人，科长就占七人，几乎一长领导一员。如计供科去年有五个半人工作，科长就有三人，有问题请示科长，往往推来推去。城市建设部一些工作人员写的大字报提出，由于机关内文件、资料的收发和保管制度不健全，许多文件在转送处理过程中发现积压、拖拉、互不负责、丢失、错分、错发等现象。有些大字报提出，由于机关行政管理工作上的混乱，一年多以来共损坏玻璃二千七百多块，打破和丢失食具四千多件，丢失锁钥二百四十把。建筑材料工业部的一些工作人员，写大字报批评使用和提拔干部工作上的缺点，认为有些不该提拔的干部被提拔了，有些不应该提级的提级了。这些大字报的一个特点，是批评劳动工资和生活福利制度不合理的意见多，要求提高生活福利待遇的意见极少。
    最近，这三个部都分别采取具体措施，进一步发动群众鸣放，并且组织力量着手研究群众提出的各种问题，准备逐步分批地加以处理。
