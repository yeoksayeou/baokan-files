Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 23rd: The broad masses of workers and students in Tianjin warmly support the declaration of the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and the peace declaration of the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties.

    Many factory workers and staff eagerly read these two declarations during rest periods and held discussions. Dong Wenyou, an old worker in the steelmaking department of Tianjin Steel Plant, said at a discussion that the development of Soviet science and technology far surpassed that of the imperialist countries, and the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are united as one, and their strength is growing day by day. This strength is invincible to imperialism. Xu Shulan, a box-filling worker at Zhonghua Match Factory and mother of seven children, said after reading the peace declaration that the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unparalleled and will surely be able to prevent war. For the sake of the happy lives of humankind and children, I resolutely support this peace declaration. Zhou Changgui, a roving worker in spinning and a veteran of the Chinese People's Volunteers, raised his right hand, which lost two fingers in the Korean War, and said that war is cruel, and the Chinese people do not want another war. However, the Chinese people have never been intimidated by wars of aggression. If the imperialists do not listen to the warnings of the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the world and dare to provoke a new war, I will definitely take up my gun again and return to the front line to stop the war.

    Many teachers and students in schools also expressed their feelings after reading these two declarations. Luo Zhongxiang, a sophomore in the Chinese Department of Nankai University, immediately wrote a poem praising peace after reading the Peace Declaration. He Guozhu, a professor in the Physics Department of Nankai University who is preparing to establish the Tianjin Artificial Satellite Observatory, said that as a scientist, I firmly support the Peace Declaration.

    This newspaper, Xi'an, November 23rd: The broad masses of workers in the Xi'an area warmly support the declaration of the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and the peace declaration. Workers in various factories are very enthusiastic about reading newspapers and listening to the radio. After work every day, the factory bulletin boards are crowded with people, and some factories organize collective reading by production and trade union groups. Some workers also hold informal discussions after reading. Fu Jingshu, a female worker at Northwest State-owned Cotton Mill No. 3, who has been named an advanced producer for one year and nine months in a row, said: These two declarations mark the unparalleled unity of the socialist camp and the working people of the world. It is a great encouragement to all peace-loving people in the world.

    社会主义阵营团结巩固的标志
    天津西安各界热烈颂赞两个宣言
    据新华社天津23日电　天津市广大职工和学生热烈拥护社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言及各共产党和工人党代表会议和平宣言。
    许多工厂的工人和职员在休息时间争相阅读这两个宣言，并举行座谈。天津钢厂炼钢部的老工人董文友在座谈会上说，苏联科学技术的发展远远超过了帝国主义国家，以苏联为首的社会主义国家团结一致，力量一天比一天强大，这种力量是帝国主义所不能战胜的。中华火柴厂装盒女工徐淑兰是七个孩子的母亲，她看了和平宣言以后说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量强大无比，一定能够防止战争。为了人类和孩子的幸福生活，我坚决拥护这个和平宣言。粗纱工人、中国人民志愿军复员军人周长贵举起他在朝鲜战争中失掉两个指头的右手说，战争是残酷的，全中国人民都不愿再有战争。但是中国人民向来没有被侵略战争吓倒过，如果帝国主义不听从全世界共产党和工人党代表的警告，敢于挑起新战争，我一定要拿起枪杆重返前线，制止战争。
    许多学校的教师和学生看到这两个宣言后也发表了自己的感想。南开大学中文系二年级学生罗中祥读完和平宣言以后，立即作了一首赞美和平的诗。正在筹备建立天津人造卫星观测站的南开大学物理系教授何国柱说，作为一个科学家，我坚决拥护和平宣言。
    本报西安23日电　西安地区广大工人群众热烈拥护社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言及和平宣言。各厂工人阅读报纸和收听广播的情绪都非常高涨。每天下班后，工厂的报牌前都站满了人，有些工厂还以生产和工会小组为单位组织集体阅读。有些工人读后还进行漫谈。西北国棉三厂连续一年零九个月被评为先进生产者的女工傅景书说：这两个宣言标志着社会主义阵营和全世界劳动人民无比的团结。它对世界上一切爱好和平的人民都是莫大的鼓舞。
