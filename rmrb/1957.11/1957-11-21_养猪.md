    Pig Raising
    Breaking Historical Records
    The current pig population in Jiangsu and Guizhou provinces has exceeded any historical period. The number of pigs raised in Anhui Province this year has also surpassed the peak level of 1953 in recent years.
    Jiangsu Province plans to raise 10 million pigs this year, and the current pig inventory has reached 9.77 million. Farmers in Guizhou Province have raised 5 million pigs, averaging 1.6 pigs per household, compared to only 3 million in 1944, the year with the highest pig population in history. By the end of September, the number of pigs in Anhui Province reached 6.76 million, 60% more than in 1953.
    Reaching the Program Targets
    Wangcheng County in Hunan Province raises an average of 5.3 pigs per household this year, and Kang County in Gansu Province raises an average of 2.1 pigs per household, exceeding the targets set in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) of 2.5 to 3 pigs per household by 1967 and 1.5 to 2 pigs per household by 1962.
    Wangcheng County only had more than 120,000 pigs in 1953, but now it has developed to more than 510,000, and it is planned to reach 650,000 next year. At present, 93.7% of the farmers in the county raise pigs, and income from pig raising accounts for 28% of the county's total agricultural income. Mass livestock prevention and treatment stations have been established in all townships in the county, and some townships and communes have basically eliminated hog cholera.
    Six Pigs per Household
    Jinli Township in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, raises an average of more than six pigs per household, nearly double the number last year. Based on the current 5,373 pigs, the average income per household can be about 160 yuan.
    Jinli Township is located in a coastal semi-hilly area, where farmers harvest a lot of seaweed and plant water hyacinths to expand the production of green fodder. They use the stems and leaves of vegetables, pumpkins, peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops, and store green fodder in a planned way, so that they can raise pigs all year round.
    Highest Record for Pig Raising by Farm Women
    Liu Yuying, a female member of the Guanghui Second Agricultural Cooperative in Guoxi Township, Gutian County, Fujian Province, who has six children, has raised 23 pigs since March this year, setting the highest record for pig raising by rural women in the province.
    Liu Yuying has 18 years of pig raising experience. Over the years, she has used duckweed, pumpkins, radishes and sweet potato vines as the main feed for pigs. Usually, she carefully observes the feeding situation of pigs and has discovered more than a dozen kinds of wild grasses, wild vegetables and tree barks that can be used to feed pigs. Now, she can find more than 40 kinds of green fodder for feeding pigs all year round.
    Pig Raising Debate
    Farmers in Sihe Township, Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, have all formulated plans to save food and develop pig raising. In the recent month, the township has increased more than 100 fat pigs, and it is expected that by the end of this year, an average of 3.5 pigs will be raised per household.
    Not long ago, under the leadership of the Party branch, the farmers of Sihe Township conducted a major debate on pig raising. Through the debate, the farmers further clarified that it is necessary to vigorously develop pig raising in the future to create favorable conditions for agricultural production increase. After the debate, the CCP branch of this township actively helped farmers solve the difficulties in pig raising. All agricultural cooperatives in the township have readjusted and appropriately increased the private plots of the members, so that the members can appropriately develop fodder production. Many agricultural cooperatives lent a batch of piglets to a small number of poor members for raising. (Xinhua News Agency)

    养猪
    突破历史纪录
    江苏、贵州两省目前养猪数量，已超过历史上任何时期。安徽省今年饲养的生猪也超过了近年来养猪最多的1953年的水平。
    江苏省计划今年养猪一千万头，目前的生猪存量已达九百七十七万头。贵州省农民养猪已达五百万头，平均每个农户养一点六头，历史上养猪最多的1944年只有三百万头。安徽省的生猪数量到9月底止就达到六百七十六万头，比1953年多60％。
    达到纲要指标
    湖南省望城县今年平均每个农户养猪五点三头，甘肃省康县平均每个农户养猪二点一头，分别超过了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）提出的到1967年平均每户养猪二头半到三头、1962年平均每户养猪一头半到两头的指标。
    望城县1953年还只养有十二万多头猪，现在已发展到五十一万多头，计划明年达到六十五万头。目前全县已有93．7％的农户养了猪，养猪收入已占全县农业总收入的28％。全县各乡都建立了群众性的家畜防治所，有一些乡、社基本消灭了猪瘟。
    每户养猪六头
    福建省海澄县锦里乡平均每户养猪六头多，比去年增加近一倍。按现有生猪五千三百七十三头计算，平均每户可收入一百六十元左右。
    锦里乡处在沿海半丘陵地带，这里的农民大量捞海苔、种植水浮莲，扩大青饲料生产，利用蔬菜、南瓜、花生、甘薯等作物的茎叶，并有计划地把青饲料贮藏起来，使一年四季都能养猪。
    农妇养猪最高纪录
    福建古田县过溪乡光辉第二农业社有六个孩子的女社员刘玉英，从今年3月开始，饲养了二十三头猪，创造了全省农村妇女养猪的最高纪录。
    刘玉英有十八年的养猪经验。历年来，她都是利用浮萍、南瓜、萝卜和番薯藤作为猪的主要的饲料。平时，她仔细观察猪的觅食情况，发现了十多种可喂猪的野草、野菜和树皮。现在，一年四季她都能找到四十多种喂猪的青饲料。
    养猪大辩论
    四川省内江县四合乡农民都订出了节约粮食、发展养猪的计划。全乡在最近的一个月中，增加了毛猪一百多头，预计到今年年底，将达到平均每户养猪三头半。
    不久以前，四合乡农民在党支部领导下，对养猪问题进行了大辩论。通过辩论，农民们进一步明确了今后必须大量发展养猪，为农业增产创造有利条件。这个乡的中共支部，在大辩论以后，积极帮助农民解决养猪中的困难。全乡各农业社重新调整和适当增加了社员的自留地，以便社员适当发展饲料生产。许多农业社贷出一批仔猪，给一小部分贫困的社员喂养。　　　（新华社）
