    I Love Reading the "Household Affairs" Column

    Recently, the "Household Affairs" column, which has been published for several issues on page 8 of the People's Daily, has been very eye-catching and popular. For example, "What Causes Itching Around a Child's Anus?", "Introducing Several Fabric-Saving Cutting Patterns to Housewives", "Why Are People Prone to Colds in Autumn?", etc. These articles are not only concise and to the point, but also provide a lot of common sense for daily life, which people can immediately apply after reading. After I read them to the women in the countryside, they were all very happy, and some went back and immediately followed the instructions. They reflected one after another: "It truly is the People's Daily, publishing only things that the people need." Based on the feedback from our area, I have a few suggestions for the "Household Affairs" column: (1) Such articles should be published regularly in the future; (2) People's needed household life common sense should be published in a timely manner according to the season and time; (3) I hope that readers from all over the country will introduce more experience in this area and write to the People's Daily in a timely manner.

### 我很爱看“家事”栏

    我很爱看“家事”栏
    最近人民日报八版上连续刊登了几期“家事”栏，很惹人注意、爱看。如“孩子的肛门部发痒是怎么回事”、“向主妇们介绍几种省布的裁剪图样”、“秋季为什么容易伤风感冒”等，这些文章不但短小精悍，而且提供了不少的日常生活常识，人们看了以后就可以立即运用。我给农村的妇女们读了以后，她们都很欢喜，有的回去就照办了。纷纷反映：“真是人民日报，登的净是人民需要的事”。根据我们这里的反应，给“家事”栏提几点意见：（一）今后这类文章要经常登；（二）要随着季节、时令适时地发表人们所需要的家庭生活常识；（三）希望各地读者，多介绍这方面的经验，及时写给人民日报。
