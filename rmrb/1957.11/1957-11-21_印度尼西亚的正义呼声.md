    Indonesian Voices for Justice
    By a commentator of this newspaper
    The nationwide movement of the Indonesian people demanding the recovery of West Irian has reached a new peak. Recently, Indonesian national leaders have repeatedly called on the Indonesian people to unite to realize this universal demand. On November 18, about one million people held a mass rally in Jakarta demanding the recovery of West Irian. President Sukarno emphasized: "We cannot beg the imperialists; we must organize our strength to fight them." This is a powerful call from the Indonesian people determined to take practical actions to recover West Irian.
    West Irian was originally part of Indonesian territory. However, after Indonesia's independence, the Netherlands continued to implement colonial rule there. In order to recover West Irian, Indonesia has held many negotiations with the Netherlands and repeatedly appealed to the United Nations, but to no avail. At the same time, the Netherlands has taken various measures to consolidate its control over West Irian, attempting to permanently occupy this territory of Indonesia. Not long ago, the Dutch government openly announced that West Irian would be included in the "Common Market" organized by Western European countries. It also issued a joint statement with Australia, stating that they would implement close cooperation in governing the East and West Irian "territories." These situations cannot but arouse the anger of the Indonesian people.
    The reason why the Dutch colonialists dare to continue to occupy Indonesia's territory of West Irian is largely because they have received support from the United States and other Western countries. In the past, when the United Nations General Assembly discussed the West Irian issue, the United States, while attempting to disguise itself by voting "abstain," was actually hostile to the Republic of Indonesia. The secret documents lost by the US Embassy in Taipei not long ago proved that the United States' fundamental policy towards Indonesia was to overthrow this young republic in order to restore the rule of Western colonialists. The American bourgeois press has also continuously revealed that, due to "strategic" considerations, it is absolutely unwilling to allow Indonesia, which pursues a policy of peace and neutrality, to recover West Irian. Recently, an editorial in "The Washington Post and Times Herald" openly advocated that if Indonesia proposes to the United Nations to recover West Irian, "we should vote against recognizing this demand."
    The Indonesian people's struggle to recover West Irian is not only to oppose colonialism and strive for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also part of the struggle to defend world peace. We know that if a country's national sovereignty and independence are threatened, then its peace and security are inevitably threatened. In fact, the imperialists have turned West Irian into a center for their activities to subvert the Republic of Indonesia, and want to turn this strategically important place into a military base in Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific. Therefore, all anti-colonialist and peace-loving people cannot but care about the resolution of the West Irian issue, and fully sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Indonesian people.
    Thanks to the support of socialist countries and Asian and African countries, the West Irian issue has been included in the agenda of this session of the United Nations General Assembly. In accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations has a full responsibility to take effective measures on this issue related to Indonesian national sovereignty and world peace. This is another test for the United Nations organization.
    However, regardless of the outcome of the United Nations discussion, the determination of the Indonesian people to recover West Irian is unshakable, and the support of socialist countries and Asian and African countries for the Indonesian people is also unshakable. As President Sukarno said, the struggle to recover West Irian does not depend on New York, but on Indonesia. The sympathy and support of the Chinese people will always be on the side of the Indonesian people, and we believe that the Indonesian people's just struggle to recover West Irian will surely be victorious.

    印度尼西亚的正义呼声
    本报评论员
    印度尼西亚人民要求收复西伊里安的全国性运动，已经达到一个新的高峰。最近，印度尼西亚国家领导人一再号召印度尼西亚人民团结一致，来实现这个全民的要求。11月18日，雅加达约有一百万人举行了群众大会，要求收复西伊里安。苏加诺总统强调指出：“我们不能向帝国主义者乞求，我们必须把我们的力量组织起来同它们斗争。”这是印度尼西亚人民决心要用实际行动来收复西伊里安的强有力的呼声。
    西伊里安本来是印度尼西亚领土的一部分。但是在印度尼西亚独立以后，荷兰在那里继续实行殖民统治。印度尼西亚为了收复西伊里安，曾经同荷兰举行多次谈判，并屡次向联合国呼吁，但是都没有得到任何结果。在这同时，荷兰就采取种种措施来巩固它对西伊里安的控制，企图永远霸占印度尼西亚的这块领土。不久以前，荷兰政府公然宣布把西伊里安划入西欧国家所组织的“共同市场”的范围。它又同澳大利亚发表联合声明，表示它们要在统治东、西伊里安“属地”方面实行密切合作。这些情况不能不激起印度尼西亚人民的愤怒。
    荷兰殖民者所以敢于继续霸占印度尼西亚的领土西伊里安，一个重要的原因是由于它得到了美国和其他西方国家的支持。美国在过去联合国大会讨论西伊里安问题时，虽然企图把自己伪装起来，投票“弃权”，但是它实际上是敌视印度尼西亚共和国的。不久以前台北美国大使馆遗失的秘密文件就证明了，美国对印度尼西亚的根本政策是要推翻这个年青共和国，以恢复西方殖民者的统治。美国资产阶级报刊也曾经不断透露，由于“战略”的考虑，它绝对不愿意让执行和平中立政策的印度尼西亚收复西伊里安。最近，“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”的社论更公开主张，如果印度尼西亚向联合国提出收复西伊里安时，“我们应当投票反对承认这个要求”。
    印度尼西亚人民要求收复西伊里安的斗争，不仅是为了反对殖民主义，争取国家主权和领土的完整，同时它也是保卫世界和平斗争的一部分。我们知道，如果一个国家的民族主权和独立受到威胁，那么它的和平和安全也就必然受到威胁。事实上，帝国主义者已把西伊里安变为它颠覆印度尼西亚共和国的活动中心，并且想把这个富有战略意义的地方变为它在东南亚和西南太平洋的军事基地。因此，一切反对殖民主义的和爱好和平的人民，都不能不关心西伊里安问题的解决，并且完全同情和支持印度尼西亚人民的正义斗争。
    由于社会主义国家和亚非国家的支持，西伊里安问题已经列入本届联合国大会的议程。根据联合国宪章的精神，联合国完全有责任对这一有关印度尼西亚国家主权和世界和平的问题，采取有效的措施。这是对于联合国组织的又一次考验。
    但是，不论联合国讨论的结果如何，印度尼西亚人民要求收复西伊里安的决心是不可动摇的，社会主义国家和亚非各国人民对印度尼西亚人民的支持也是不可动摇的。正如苏加诺总统所说，收复西伊里安的斗争不是取决于纽约，而是取决于印度尼西亚。中国人民的同情和支持永远在印度尼西亚人民这一边，我们相信印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的正义斗争必将取得胜利。
