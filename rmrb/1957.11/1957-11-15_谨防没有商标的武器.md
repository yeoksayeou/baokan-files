Beware of Weapons Without Trademarks
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

Recently, the Indian magazine "Blitz" published copies of two telegrams sent by the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Allison, to the U.S. State Department in March of this year. These documents were lost by the U.S. Embassy in Taipei during the anti-American demonstrations in Taipei in May. They definitively confirm a series of subversive activities carried out by the United States in Indonesia. These documents show that the United States sent people to Sumatra and other places to "establish personal contacts" with rebel leaders there and transported weapons from Taiwan and Malaya to support these troops. The United States also planned to "transfer troops from Taiwan to help the Islamic State movement's forces." At the same time, the United States actively planned a "political crisis" in Indonesia, colluding with certain pro-American forces in Indonesia in an attempt to overthrow President Sukarno.

The long-term subversive activities of the United States in Indonesia have long been known to all. The four military coups led by Lubis that occurred in Jakarta last year and the local military coups that occurred in Sumatra and other places were all instigated and supported by the United States. Since the beginning of this year, especially after President Sukarno's reform plan was announced, the United States' interference and subversion activities in Indonesia have intensified. The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta has become the center for carrying out these despicable activities. It provides funding, transports arms, spreads rumors, and buys agents, doing everything possible. Now, this activity of the United States has been confirmed by Allison himself. The conspiracy of the U.S. State Department has been exposed.

It is not surprising that the United States wants to overthrow President Sukarno and subvert the young Republic of Indonesia. President Sukarno and the Indonesian nationalist forces have consistently advocated implementing an anti-colonialist policy, advocating consolidating Indonesia's independence and freedom, and maintaining friendly relations with all countries in the world. President Sukarno's reform plan is a measure taken to strengthen national unity, unification, and independence. Under the leadership of President Sukarno, the Republic of Indonesia is advancing along the road of independent development. This is of course incompatible with the U.S. colonial aggression policy. Therefore, for several years, the United States has been supporting reactionary forces in Indonesia, organizing military coups, creating local divisions, and instigating government crises, so that Indonesia's independence, security, unity, and social life order have been constantly threatened and damaged. The United States wants to use these despicable means to attack the nationalist forces represented by President Sukarno, prevent the growth of the young Republic of Indonesia, and return it to the enslavement of Western colonialism. However, the Indonesian people, who are "once free, forever free," have not been intimidated by this offensive of U.S. imperialism. The facts have made it clearer to them who their friends are and who their enemies are.

The U.S. State Department documents are a great irony to the sweet words it often proclaims. According to reports, with the "official support" of the U.S. State Department, the United States is now holding a large-scale "Asian Month," the purpose of which is to express U.S. "friendship" and "cooperation" with Asian countries. However, the whole world has seen from the U.S. State Department documents what the United States is doing in Asian countries. Allison said in his telegram to the U.S. State Department: The weapons transported from Taiwan and Malaya to the Indonesian rebels "must absolutely not have trademarks and must be placed in containers locally used to load agricultural machinery, textiles, canned food, and the like..." This is the U.S. "friendship" and "cooperation" with Asian countries! The people of Asian countries should be vigilant: Beware of the United States' weapons without trademarks!

    谨防没有商标的武器
    本报评论员
    最近印度“闪电”周刊刊载了今年3月间美国驻印度尼西亚大使艾利逊致美国国务院的两份电报的副本。这些文件是台北美国大使馆在5月间台北反美示威中遗失的。它确凿地证实了美国在印度尼西亚进行的一系列的颠覆活动。这些文件表明，美国曾派人到苏门答腊等地，同那里的叛军领袖“建立个人联系”，并从台湾和马来亚运送武器支援这些军队。美国还曾计划“从台湾调派部队来帮助伊斯兰教国运动的军队”。同时，美国积极策划印度尼西亚的“政治危机”，勾结印度尼西亚的某些亲美势力，企图推翻苏加诺总统。
    美国对印度尼西亚长期进行颠覆活动，本来是尽人皆知的。去年在雅加达发生的卢比斯四次军事政变和在苏门答腊等地发生的地方性军事政变，就都受到美国的指使和支持。今年以来，特别是苏加诺总统的改革方案公布以后，美国干涉和颠覆印度尼西亚的活动更是变本加厉起来。美国驻雅加达的大使馆已经成为进行这种卑鄙活动的中心。它提供经费，运送军火，散布谣言，收买代理人，无所不为。现在，美国的这种活动已经由艾利逊自己证实了。美国国务院的阴谋已经露底了。
    美国想要推翻苏加诺总统，颠覆年青的印度尼西亚共和国，这是不足为奇的。苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚民族主义力量一贯主张执行反殖民主义的政策，主张巩固印度尼西亚的独立自由，并与世界各国友好相处。苏加诺总统的改革方案也就是为了加强民族团结、统一和独立而采取的一种措施。在苏加诺总统的领导下，印度尼西亚共和国正在沿着独立发展的道路前进。这当然是同美国殖民侵略政策不相容的。因此，几年以来，美国一直在印度尼西亚扶植反动势力，组织军事政变，制造地方割据，策动政府危机，使印度尼西亚的独立、安全、统一和社会生活秩序，不断遭受威胁和破坏。美国就是想用这些卑鄙的手段，来打击苏加诺总统所代表的民族主义力量，阻止年青的印度尼西亚共和国的成长，使它重新处于西方殖民主义的奴役之下。但是，“一旦自由，就永远自由”的印度尼西亚人民并没有被美帝国主义的这种进攻吓退。事实更加清楚地告诉他们，谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人。
    美国国务院的文件，是对于它经常宣扬的花言巧语的莫大讽刺。据报道，在美国国务院的“正式支持”下，美国现在正举行声势浩大的“亚洲月”，目的是为了表示美国对亚洲国家的“友谊”和“合作”。但是，全世界都从美国国务院的文件里看到了，美国在亚洲国家里干的究竟是什么。艾利逊在他给美国国务院的电报中说：从台湾和马来亚运送给印度尼西亚叛军的武器“绝对不可以带有商标，并且要放在当地用来装载农业机器、纺织品、罐头食品等一类的容器里面。……”这就是美国对亚洲国家的“友谊”和“合作”！亚洲各国人民应该提高警惕：谨防美国的没有商标的武器！
