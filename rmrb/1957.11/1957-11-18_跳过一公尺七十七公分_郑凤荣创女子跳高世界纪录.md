Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: Zheng Fengrong cleared a height of 1.77 meters in Beijing on the 17th, breaking the world record of 1.76 meters set by American black athlete Mildred McDaniel in Melbourne on December 1st last year, which had been maintained for less than a year.

This is the third person in our country to create a world record, following Chen Jingkai and Qi Lieyun.

Zheng Fengrong is twenty years old this year and is 1.70 meters tall. She participated in the women's high jump competition of the Beijing Municipal Games at the Xiannongtan Stadium on the 17th. When she cleared this historically significant height at 11:23 a.m. Beijing time, the track and field chief referee, national referee Jin Yan, and Zheng Fengrong's coach Huang Jian, as well as many athletes, warmly congratulated her.

Today, after about half an hour of preparation, Zheng Fengrong used the "scissors" technique to easily clear the first height she requested – 1.56 meters. Subsequently, she cleared the heights of 1.60 meters, 1.64 meters, 1.68 meters, and 1.72 meters in one jump. When the bar was raised to 1.77 meters, she failed to clear it on her first attempt because she did not step accurately. However, she finally succeeded on her second attempt. This year, Zheng Fengrong has cleared 1.70 meters and above eight times. No other female athlete in the world has been able to clear such heights so many times in a year.

    跳过一公尺七十七公分
    郑凤荣创女子跳高世界纪录
    据新华社17日讯　郑凤荣17日在北京跳过了一公尺七十七公分的高度，打破了美国黑人运动员麦克丹尼尔去年12月1日在墨尔本创造的、保持了还不到一年的一公尺七十六公分的世界纪录。
    这是继陈镜开、戚烈云之后，我国创造世界纪录的第三人。
    郑凤荣今年二十岁，身高一公尺七十公分。她17日在先农坛体育场参加了北京市运动会的女子跳高比赛。当她在北京时间上午十一点二十三分跳过了这个有历史意义的高度以后，在场的田径总裁判长、国家裁判金岩和郑凤荣的指导黄健，以及许多运动员向她热烈祝贺。
    今天，郑凤荣做了约半个钟头的准备活动以后，就用“剪式”动作非常轻松地跳过了她要求跳的第一个高度——一公尺五十六公分。随后，一公尺六十公分、一公尺六十四公分、一公尺六十八公分和一公尺七十二公分的高度，她都是一跃而过。横竿升高到一公尺七十七公分时，她第一次因为步点没有踏准，没有跳过。但是，她第二次试跳时终于获得了成功。郑凤荣今年八次跳过了一公尺七十公分和一公尺七十公分以上的高度，世界上还没有其他女运动员能在一年内这么多次跳过这样的高度。
