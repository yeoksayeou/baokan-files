Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 25th. The first phase of the expansion project at the Dushanzi Refinery of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration has recently been completed and put into production. After this expansion, the refinery's crude oil processing capacity has doubled.

The Dushanzi Refinery was expanded to accommodate the increasing crude oil production from the Karamay oilfield. Since the Karamay oilfield began drilling production test wells in September this year, an average of one production test well has been put into production every three to four days in the fourth quarter, and crude oil production has increased significantly compared to before. In 1958, the Karamay oilfield will drill a large number of production test wells, and crude oil production will increase further. After this expansion of the Dushanzi Refinery, the crude oil produced in Karamay next year will be promptly refined into various power fuels to support Xinjiang's economic construction.

    提炼克拉玛依增产的原油
    独山子炼油厂首期扩建工程完工
    新华社乌鲁木齐25日电　新疆石油管理局独山子炼油厂第一期扩建工程，已在最近完工并投入生产。这次扩建之后，这个炼油厂处理原油的设备能力比原来提高了一倍。
    独山子炼油厂是为适应克拉玛依油田原油产量不断增长而扩建的。克拉玛依油田今年9月开始打生产试验油井以后，第四季度平均每三、四天就有一口生产试验井投入生产，原油产量比原来提高了很多。到1958年，克拉玛依油田将大量钻凿生产试验井，原油产量还要提高。独山子炼油厂经过这次扩建后，明年克拉玛依生产的原油就将及时被炼制成各种动力燃料，支援新疆经济建设。
