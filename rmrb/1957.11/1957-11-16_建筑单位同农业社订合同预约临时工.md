Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Beijing is beginning to promote this method, which benefits both the agricultural cooperatives and the production and lives of temporary workers, and can reduce the blind influx of people into the cities.

The Beijing Real Estate Administration Construction Engineering Company has already signed contracts with six agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province and suburban Beijing to solve a portion of the temporary worker supply problem.

Through the signing of contracts, the company has reserved more than 250 temporary workers from these agricultural cooperatives, 30% of whom first signed contracts with their original agricultural cooperatives and then linked up with the company. In this way, temporary workers can participate in agricultural production when they are not engaged in urban construction labor, and their family life can also be taken care of by the agricultural cooperative when they come to the city to work. The agricultural cooperative can increase its labor force and use part of the wages turned over by the temporary workers as revolving funds for developing production. The construction unit can also obtain the temporary workers it needs on time. In this way, the blind influx of population from rural areas to cities can be reduced.

There are now more than 50,000 temporary workers in various construction units in Beijing, and these units will sign such reservation contracts with the agricultural cooperatives in the temporary workers' places of origin.

In the past, temporary workers in construction units would return to the countryside to rest every winter, and when spring came, those who received reservation slips would come to the construction site to work as laborers, while those who did not receive reservation slips would blindly flock to the cities to find work. This time, after the Beijing Real Estate Administration Construction Engineering Company signed contracts with the agricultural cooperatives of more than 250 temporary workers, the temporary workers became members of the agricultural cooperatives working outside. The phenomenon of temporary workers having nothing to do in winter no longer exists. Many temporary workers received letters from their cooperatives a few days ago saying, "This winter, the cooperative will develop a large amount of wasteland and has included your labor in it."

After the temporary workers become members of their original agricultural cooperatives, they remit part of their wages to the agricultural cooperatives. More than 60 members of Zhang Guifeng Village, Nanpi County, Hebei Province, work as temporary workers in Beijing. They send money to the cooperative every month, and the agricultural cooperative uses the money to purchase two rubber-wheeled carts and 500 piglets. Temporary worker Yu Zhifang said: "In the past, money was spent easily when it was in hand, but now it is saved when it is remitted to the cooperative. The cooperative has accomplished great things, and I can still receive grain and other agricultural products at the end of the year. It's really a win-win situation."

The agricultural cooperatives also treat temporary workers as members of the cooperative, properly take care of their families, record work points for them according to regulations, distribute agricultural products based on work points in the autumn, and are responsible for sending them grain coupons and cloth coupons. In this way, temporary workers can work with peace of mind outside and do not have to worry about their families. When the wife of Dai Yujie, a plasterer in the Third Work Zone of the company, gave birth to a child, the agricultural cooperative sent him eggs and money according to regulations, and Dai Yujie was very happy after receiving a letter from home. The agricultural cooperative of Zhang Guifeng Village, Hebei Province, has already spun the newly harvested cotton into cotton wadding and made cotton clothes to send to the temporary workers from the cooperative working in Beijing for the winter.

### 建筑单位同农业社订合同预约临时工

    建筑单位同农业社订合同预约临时工
    北京开始推行这一办法，对农业社和临时工的生产生活都有好处，并可减少盲目流入城市的人口。
    新华社15日讯　北京市建筑单位所需的临时工人将逐步改由农业生产合作社负责供应。
    北京市房地产管理局修建工程公司已经首先同河北省和北京市郊区等地六个农业生产合作社签订合同，解决了一部分临时工人的供应问题。
    通过签订合同，这个公司向这些农业社预约了二百五十多名临时工人，其中有30％的临时工人是自己先和原籍的农业社订立合同，然后再和公司挂钩的。这样，临时工人在不参加城市建筑劳动时可以参加农业生产，在到城市劳动时，他的家庭生活也可得到农业社的照顾；而农业社既增加了劳动力，又可利用临时工人上缴的部分工薪作为发展生产的周转金；建筑单位也可以按时得到所需的临时工人。这样，从农村盲目流入城市的人口就可以减少。
    北京市各有关建筑单位现在共有五万多临时工人，这些单位都将分别同临时工人原籍的农业社签订这种预约合同。
    过去建筑单位的临时工人，每逢冬季就回农村休息，到第二年春暖花开时，接到预约条的就再到建筑工地来做壮工，没有接到预约条的就盲目流入城市找工作。这次北京市房地产管理局修建工程公司同二百五十多名临时工人原籍的农业社订立合同以后，临时工人就成为农业社在外做工的社员。临时工人冬季无事做的现象不再有了，许多临时工人在前几天已经接到社里来信说，“今冬，社里要开拓大量荒田，已把你的劳动力算在里面。”
    临时工人成为他原籍的农业社的社员以后，把所领到的部分工薪寄给农业社。河北省南皮县张古风村六十多个社员在北京做临时工人，他们按月往社里寄钱，农业社用这些钱购买了两辆胶皮轱辘大车，还买了五百个小猪仔。临时工人于芝芳说：“过去钱在手里顺手就花了，现在把它寄给社里就积下了，社里顶了大事，自己年终还可以分到粮食和其他农产品，真是两上算。”
    农业社也把临时工人当做社里的一员，妥善照顾他们的家庭，按规定给他们记工分，秋后再根据工分分配农产品，并且负责给他们寄粮票和布票。这样，临时工人可以安心在外生产，不必再牵挂家里的事情。这个公司三工区抹灰工戴玉杰的妻子生小孩时，农业社按规定给他送了鸡蛋和钱，戴玉杰接到家里来信后很高兴。河北省张古风村农业社已经把采下来的新棉花弹成棉絮做了棉衣，寄给这个社在北京做工的临时工人过冬。
