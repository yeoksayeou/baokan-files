Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 17th: The Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a formal statement on the evening of the 16th, stating that the Bahrain Islands in the Persian Gulf are an Arab country and have nothing to do with Iran.

The Iranian authorities believe that the Bahrain Islands are a region of Iran and recently decided to declare the Bahrain Islands as Iran's fourteenth province. The statement said that the Syrian government was surprised by the actions of the Iranian authorities.

The statement said: "The Bahrain Islands were, and still are, part of the Arab countries, and they cannot be separated from them. Its residents are part of the Arab nation." The resolution of the Arab League Council in December 1954 announced this. Britain also recognized this in the treaty signed with Sheikh Mohammed ibn Khalifa of the Bahrain Islands in 1861.

The statement concluded that Syria is eager to strengthen the understanding between Arab countries and Iran, and it believes that "it is unwise for the Iranian authorities to raise such an issue that cannot improve relations between the Arab and Iranian peoples."

    叙外交部发言人声明
    巴林群岛是个阿拉伯国家
    新华社大马士革17日电　叙利亚外交部发言人16日晚发表正式声明说，波斯湾的巴林群岛是阿拉伯国家，跟伊朗毫无关系。
    伊朗当局认为巴林群岛是伊朗的地方，并且在最近决定宣布巴林群岛为伊朗的第十四个省份。声明说，叙利亚政府对于伊朗当局的行动表示惊讶。
    声明说：“巴林群岛过去是、现在仍然是阿拉伯国家的一部分，它不能够同它们分离，它的居民是阿拉伯民族的一部分”。1954年12月阿拉伯联盟理事会的决议曾经宣布这一点。英国在1861年同巴林群岛的教长穆罕默德·伊本·哈利法签订的条约中也承认了这一点。
    声明最后说，叙利亚渴望加强阿拉伯国家和伊朗的谅解，它认为“伊朗当局提出这样一个并不能使阿拉伯人民和伊朗人民的关系得到改善的问题是不明智的”。
