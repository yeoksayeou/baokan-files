    The Poisonous Influence of Juvenile Delinquency

    A while ago, the American magazine "Life" published an article documenting juvenile delinquency in Western countries. According to the magazine, the purpose of writing this article was to prove that juvenile delinquency is not "monopolized" by the United States alone, but occurs in almost all Western countries.

    The article pointed out: In the United States, the juvenile delinquency rate has increased by 17.3% compared to the past, and in New York, it has increased by 25%. These juvenile delinquents often form various groups to fight and cause trouble everywhere, and even commit murder. In order to cope with the increasing number of juvenile delinquency cases, the New York authorities have increased the number of police officers, but it is still difficult to prevent. A New York police officer said: Juvenile delinquency is "like a fire in the forest, you don't know where it will happen next."

    In the United Kingdom, like in the United States, juvenile delinquency cases have had an "alarming increase" in recent years. In 1956, the number of criminals under the age of twenty-one arrested in large cities increased by 12.6% compared to 1955. Nearly two-thirds of the criminals were acting in groups of two or three. Due to the large increase in juvenile delinquents, juvenile reformatories are already overcrowded, and many juvenile delinquents have to be crammed into various local prisons. There, the children have learned a lot of criminal experience from adult criminals.

    In West Germany, juvenile delinquency has also grown rapidly since the war. These juvenile delinquents form various groups to disrupt, rob, and steal.

    In Italy, juvenile delinquency has also developed. Recently, the Rome police cracked down on three juvenile delinquency groups distributed in various districts of Rome. These groups specialize in stealing bicycles and motorcycles. In France, juvenile delinquency is also a major problem since the war.

    少年犯罪的流毒
    不久前的一期美国“生活”画报上刊载了一篇记载西方国家里少年犯罪的文章。据这家画报说，写这篇文章为的是要证明，少年犯罪并不是美国一个国家所“垄断”的，而是几乎发生在许多西方国家。
    这篇文章指出：在美国少年犯罪率已比过去增加了17．3％，而在纽约则增加了25％。这些少年罪犯经常组成各种各样集团到处殴斗闹事，甚至杀人。为了应付日益增多的少年犯罪案件，纽约当局已加派了警察，但是还是防不胜防。纽约一个警官说：少年犯罪“像森林中起火一样，你不知道究竟下一次会在什么地方发生”。
    在英国像在美国一样，最近几年来少年犯罪案件有了“令人不安的增加”。1956年大城市里被捕的二十一岁以下的罪犯比1955年增长了12．6％。将近三分之二的罪犯是结伙成二三个集团进行活动的。由于少年罪犯的大量增加，少年感化院里已经人满为患，许多少年罪犯不得不充塞在各个地方监狱中。在那里，孩子们都学到了不少大犯人的犯罪经验。
    在西德，少年犯罪在战后也有了飞快的增长。这些少年犯结成各种集团进行扰乱、抢劫和偷窃。
    在意大利少年犯罪也有所发展。最近罗马市警察曾破获了三个分布在罗马各区的少年罪犯集团。这些集团专门盗窃自行车和摩托车。在法国，少年犯罪同样也是战后以来一个重大的问题。
