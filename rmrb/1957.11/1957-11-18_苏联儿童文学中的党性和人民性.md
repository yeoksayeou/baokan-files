Soviet children's literature is the most ideological and advanced literature in the world. It is based on the principles of Marxist-Leninist literary science and a deep understanding of children and their way of understanding things.

For forty years, its brilliant achievements have been unparalleled in the modern world literary scene and stand as a beautiful banner on the peaks of world culture.

Soviet writers have devoted arduous artistic labor to the overall path of fighting for socialist construction and for a better and happier tomorrow, taking the "task of cultivating new people" as the main task of children's literature, and have gained extremely valuable harvests. The hundreds of good works are not only the fruits of victory on the literary front but also the fruits of a great victory in political and ideological education.

However, judging from the historical path of the growth and development of Soviet children's literature, without the care and leadership of the Party, and its repeated instructions, it is impossible to imagine such achievements.

The resolution on publications at the 11th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1922 considered the literary and educational role for the new generation of communists to be extremely important. The 12th Congress in 1923 raised this issue again. In particular, the resolution at the 13th Congress in 1924 pointed out: "It is necessary to start establishing children's literature under the Party's meticulous supervision and leadership, in order to strengthen the factors of class education, internationalist education, and labor education in this literature." (Selected Translations from the Soviet Encyclopedia: "Children's Literature, Children's Films, Children's Music," page 9, People's Publishing House)

The Party made this decision because it saw that the bourgeoisie was trying to influence the working masses, and the most easily influenced young generation, through literary works. Books similar to Western European "detective novels" had already appeared, distorting real life and causing unhealthy thoughts and emotions among young readers.

The Party's decision immediately had a broad and profound impact. In 1925, Mayakovsky began writing poems for children, and in 1926, Fadeyev wrote short stories for children, while Gaidar's first novella, "Revolutionary Military Committee," was also published in the same year. After Soviet children's literature made a good start on the road forward indicated by the Party, it could gradually implement the principle of Party spirit in its works and lay the foundation for socialist realism.

This is proven by the new embodiment of this in the excellent works of writers. The works are about the people, and are written for the people, not for aristocratic children, but for the children who were liberated and saved from the fate of their fathers by the great October Socialist Revolution. The works also depict and shape the image of child revolutionaries.

This is also proven by what Abin said in "Gaidar's Creative Path" (China Youth Publishing House): "Soviet real life is the real inspirer of the children's images in his works. The ideas of the Bolshevik Party are the organizers of his creation, and the feelings of Soviet patriotism are the source of inspiration for his creation." Although it only refers to Gaidar alone, the creative path of this Communist Party member, soldier, and writer is indeed the socialist realism creative path for the development of Soviet children's literature.

It is not difficult to understand that only when a writer truly stands on the Party's position can he drink the sweet nectar and accept the Party's education as if it permeates his lungs, understand the Marxist-Leninist science of the communist education and training of the younger generation, appreciate the Party's literary and artistic policies and cultural and educational policies, stand on the height of revolutionary principles, and first of all, put politics first when considering issues, selecting themes, observing phenomena, and analyzing essence, and then use skillful artistic techniques to write good works that are pleasing to children to complete political tasks.

Kadayev, one of the excellent Soviet writers, has a very deep understanding of this point. He said: "To write a decent work that is beneficial to the people, one must firmly stand on the ideological position of communism. When this feeling of Party spirit weakens in me, I cannot write well; when the feeling of Party spirit strengthens in me, I write better." ("The Literature of the Soviet People," Volume 2, page 85, People's Literature Publishing House) This is the writer's summary of his own creative experience, but for writers who are struggling to write or cannot write well, it is no less than a special medicine.

In 1928, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) issued a special resolution on "Methods for Improving Publications for Young People and Children," which stated: "The biggest shortcomings of children's reading materials still lie in the insufficient elucidation of social themes and the style of openly evading social themes." The Party is great and wise, and its requirements for the ideological education weapon of literature and art are particularly strict. Precisely because the requirements are stricter, the direction is more correct, and the higher the principle, the deeper the ideological content and Bolshevik Party spirit, as well as the combination of children's psychological characteristics and great educational significance, become the basic characteristics of Soviet children's literary works. It also makes Soviet children's literature the most advanced, newest, and most beautiful kind of extremely brilliant children's culture in the world. Soviet writers, as revolutionary literary and artistic fighters, stand under the banner of the Party, seriously and resolutely prevent and oppose the tendency of literature to deviate from politics.

"Whoever wants to be with the people must always be with the Party. Whoever firmly stands on the Party's position will always be with the people." (Literary Gazette, 1957, issue 24, page 15) That's right: Whoever is always with the people has the broadest and richest accumulation of life. Whoever has an inexhaustible source of creation from the lives of the people can write works that are rooted in the deepest part of the soil like a thousand-year-old tree—the deepest part of the people's hearts—and will never be forgotten. In such immortal masterpieces, there is a deep popularity, and naturally there is also a distinct Party spirit that represents the interests of the people.

In 1941, Gaidar published "A Hot Stone" (Juvenile and Children's Publishing House), a short fairy tale of less than two thousand words. Such a simple and concise work contains extremely profound ideological content. —A child named Ivashka who wants to steal a few apples accidentally encounters a hot stone that can make people happy after the gatekeeper lets him go, and immediately runs back to tell the poor old man with all white hair, hoping that he can regain his youth and relive his happy childhood. However, the collective farm gatekeeper does not hope for another kind of happiness. He cherishes the life he has lived, cherishes the wounds he suffered while fighting for the happiness of the people, and cherishes the new socialist society he has won by contributing his share of strength. So he said to the kind-hearted child: "Of course, you think in your heart that I am old, lame, disabled, and very unfortunate. But in fact, I am the happiest person in the world. ... Although my own experience is not easy, I have lived it without ambiguity, honestly, what else do I want?"

The writer portrayed the image of a simple and honest old farmer, revealing his spiritual world—vividly depicting his life's wisdom and pure and noble soul. What kind of happiness does this lovely old man have? It is that he has dedicated his whole life to the revolutionary struggle for the happiness of the people. "Living for the people" is the heartfelt cry of the kind Russian people, and this is the concrete manifestation of great popularity.

Dobrolyubov once put forward a task for children's literature—to realize the ideal of "popularity in education," advocating focusing on children's reading materials that describe life, especially realistic short stories that describe the lives of the people. And Gaidar has well realized it with his own works.

In 1946, Oseeva wrote "Daddy's Short Jacket" (Juvenile and Children's Publishing House), a short story with few words. It describes a father who is about to go to the front line to fight, giving a black velvet short jacket to his eldest son, Lyonka, a fourth-grade elementary school student, asking him to take charge of the family at home and take care of his mother and younger siblings. This soft jacket with a row of silver buttons is not yet suitable for his figure, but he makes himself qualified to wear it. He works at the pier every holiday, bringing back all his wages to his mother. Work affected his studies, but his teachers and classmates helped him study well. The ending of the novel is so touching and meaningful. Dad stepped down from the ship with an empty sleeve. Lyonka squeezed through the crowd to greet him. As soon as they met, he eagerly told him about his life, but was choked by painful memories and had to stop and start again. A breeze blew in his face, lifting the hem of Dad's gray military coat, and also revealing Lyonka's black velvet short jacket draped over his shoulders.

The writer, with the brilliant image of Lyonka, reflected that during the Patriotic War, millions of Soviet children did their best in learning technology, in labor production, and in daily life to replace their fathers who went to the front line and their mothers who went to factories and hospitals. This short jacket is a sincere concern added by the father to the child, and it is also an encouragement of patriotic ideological feelings added to him. Lyonka is worthy of his father's short jacket and the school's certificate, because he is a new young man cultivated by the Young Pioneers led by the Party and the Youth League, and also a good student taught by the Party's education policy.

Krupskaya clearly said in her "What Kind of Reading Materials Do Our Children Need": "The formation of a new person...should not be spontaneous...planned influence is necessary..." And Oseeva vividly visualized this new educational principle.

Soviet writers, whether in the period of the domestic war, economic construction, the Patriotic War, or post-war construction, always write about all the things that can help children grow and develop, and educate them with the communist spirit; they always lead them to the path of broad life and into the vast world to broaden their horizons. What is written is the Red Army, heroes, and soldiers who defend the socialist motherland, what is written is the boiling Stakhanov movement in factories, mines, and collective farms in socialist construction, what is written is the amazing inventions and achievements in science and technology, what is written is teachers, doctors, and outstanding figures in various professions, and what is written is also the past, present, and future of the motherland. These, of course, are unprecedented phenomena in children's literature, clear politics, clear Party spirit, and the propaganda of Bolshevism, which implement the principles of ideological character and Party spirit in the content of children's literature. Before the October Revolution, "there was not and never has been a literature that took the lives of the working class and peasants and their struggle for socialism as the basis for the themes of their works." ("Problems of Soviet Literature and Art," page 23, People's Literature Publishing House) And after the October Revolution, "the entire children's literature was established on completely new principles that opened up the broadest prospects for the scientific and artistic thinking of images" (Gorky: "On Themes").

We absolutely disagree with the incorrect statement that children's literary works cannot strengthen political character and do not need to have Party spirit and popularity. Writers are facing a great era in which the socialist ideological system and the bourgeois ideological system are engaged in a fierce life-and-death struggle, and must write moving and good works that can educate and rally the sleeves, and become an active reserve army for socialist construction -- millions of children. The more the writer's works can stir the hearts of readers, the more correctly they can explain the problem, and the more they can encourage readers to stride forward with their chests up towards the road pointed to by the works, and contribute all their strength and enthusiasm to the just cause of the Party and the people.

This requires that children's literary works be socialist realism creations. Only in socialist realism creations can the diverse creative styles and characteristics of writers be fully developed. The method of socialist realism makes it possible to express all the new things brought about by reality itself in revolutionary development. This has been proven by the undeniable facts of the remarkable achievements of Soviet children's literature.

If anyone is still worried that emphasizing the political character of works and requiring the socialist realism creative method will bring formulaization and conceptualization to the works, then the rich and diverse hundreds of Soviet children's literary works in front of us are precisely a powerful refutation. On this great 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, we sincerely thank Soviet writers for creating exemplary works for us to observe and learn from that have guiding significance.

    苏联儿童文学中的党性和人民性
    陈伯吹
    苏联儿童文学是世界上最有思想、最先进的一种文学，它是以马克思列宁主义文艺科学的原则、以及对儿童和对儿童理解事物的特性的深刻认识为基础的。
    四十年来，它的光辉的成就，在现代世界文坛上是无与伦比的，是插在世界文化高峰上的一面美丽的旗帜。
    苏联的作家们在为了进行社会主义的建设，为了美好幸福的明天而战斗的这条总的路线上付出了艰苦的艺术劳动，把“培养新人的任务”作为儿童文学的主要任务，才获得了异常珍贵的收获。那上百种好作品固然是文学战线上的胜利的果实，也是政治思想教育上巨大胜利的果实。
    然而，从苏联儿童文学的成长和发展的历史道路上看来，如果没有党的关怀和党的领导，一次又一次地作出指示，是不可能设想有这么样的成就的。
    联共（布）于1922年的第十一次代表大会上关于出版物的决议，就认为对于新一代的共产主义的文学教育作用是极其重要的；1923年的第十二次代表大会上又重新提出了这个问题；特别是在1924年的第十三次代表大会上的决议指出：“必须在党的缜密的监督和领导下，着手建立儿童文学，以期加强这种文学中的阶级教育、国际主义教育、劳动教育的因素。”（苏联大百科全书选译本：“儿童文学、儿童影片、儿童音乐”9页，人民出版社）
    党之所以要作出这一决定，是因为它看到了资产阶级企图通过文学作品来影响劳动群众，影响最容易影响的年轻一代；并且已经出现了歪曲现实生活的、在小读者中间引起不健康的思想和情绪的、类似西欧的“侦探小说”的书籍。
    党的决定立刻发生了广泛深刻的影响。1925年马雅可夫斯基开始为儿童写诗，1926年法捷耶夫为儿童写短篇小说，而盖达尔的第一部中篇小说“革命军事委员会”也在同年出版了。苏联儿童文学在党所指示的前进的道路上发出了良好的起步以后，才能逐渐在作品中贯彻党性原则，奠定了社会主义现实主义的基础。
    这在作家们的优秀作品中有了新的体现这点上得到了证明。作品写的是人民，并且是为人民而写的，不是写给贵族孩子看的，而是写给由于伟大的十月社会主义革命所解放拯救出来免于遭受他们父辈的命运的孩子看的。作品还描写了、塑造了儿童革命者的形象。
    这又在爱宾写的“盖达尔的创作道路”（中国青年出版社）中所说的“苏联的现实生活是他的作品中的儿童形象的真正的鼓舞者。布尔什维克党的思想是他的创作的组织者，苏维埃爱国主义的情感是他创作灵感的源泉”这几句话上得到了证明。虽然所说的只是盖达尔一人，但是这个共产党员、战士、作家的创作道路，实实在在是苏联的儿童文学向前发展的社会主义现实主义创作的道路。
      这是不难理解的，只有作家真正站到党的立场上来，才能够畅饮甘露、沁入肺腑般地接受党的教育，懂得马克思列宁主义关于年轻一代的共产主义教育和训练的科学，体会党的文艺方针和文教政策，站在革命原则的高度上、首先是把政治放在第一位来考虑问题、选择题材、观察现象、分析本质，然后运用熟练的艺术技巧写出为儿童所喜见乐闻的好作品来完成政治任务。
    苏联优秀作家之一的卡达耶夫对于这点有十分深切的体会。他说：“要想写出一部像样的、对人民有益的作品，必须坚定地站在共产主义的思想立场上。当这种党性的感情在我身上减弱时，我就写不好；当党性的感情在我身上加强时，我就写得好些。”（“苏联人民的文学”下册八十五页，人民文学出版社）这是作家总结自己创作的经验之谈，但是对于正在苦闷着写不出或者写不好作品的作家来说，无异一剂特效良药。
    1928年，联共（布）中央所颁布的关于“改进青年和儿童出版物的办法”的特别决议认为：“儿童读物最大的缺点，仍然在于对社会主题的阐明不够和公然规避社会主题的作风。”党是伟大英明的，对这一思想教育武器的文艺的要求是特别严格的。正因为要求得愈严格，走的方向才愈正确，才愈能使高度的原则性、深刻的思想内容和布尔什维克的党性，以及符合儿童心理特点和涵藏巨大教育意义，成为苏联儿童文学作品的基本特征。也就使苏联儿童文学成为全世界最先进、最新颖、最优美的一种极其辉煌灿烂的儿童文化的原动力。苏联的作家们以革命文艺的战士身份，站在党的旗帜下，严肃认真地防止、并且坚决反对文学脱离政治的倾向。
      “谁要同人民在一起，谁就要永远同党在一起。谁坚定地站在党的立场上，谁就永远同人民在一起。”（1957年文艺报二十四期十五页）正是这样：谁永远同人民在一起，谁就有最深广最丰富的生活积累。谁有了来自人民生活中的取之不尽、用之不竭的创作源泉，作品才能够写得像千年老树般地扎根在土壤的最深处——人民的心的深处，永远不被忘却。在这样不朽的杰作里，是具有深厚的人民性，也自然而然地具有代表人民利益的鲜明的党性。
    1941年，盖达尔发表了“一块烫石头”（少年儿童出版社），是一篇不上两千字的小童话。在那样素朴简练的作品中，蕴藏着极其深刻的思想内容。——一个想偷摘几个苹果的孩子依瓦史卡在守园人把他放走以后，无意间碰到了能使人幸福的一块烫石头，立刻奔回去告诉那个须发全白的可怜的老头儿，想让他能回复青春，重过幸福的童年。可是这个集体农庄的守园人并不希望另一种的幸福，他爱惜他所度过的生活，爱惜他为人民的幸福而在战斗时所受的创伤，爱惜他自己贡献出一分力量来所赢得的社会主义的新社会，所以他对这个好心肠的孩子说：“自然，你心里想我老了，跛了脚，有残疾，很不幸。可是，实际上我是世界上最幸福的人。……我自己的经历虽然不容易，却过得不含糊，过得很诚实，我还要别的作什么呢？”
    作家刻划了一个淳朴敦厚的老农民的形象，揭露了他的精神世界——把他的生活的智慧和纯洁高尚的心灵绘声绘影地描画出来。这个可爱的老人所有的幸福是什么幸福呢？就是他把自己一生献给了为人民的幸福而进行的革命斗争。“活着为人民”，这是善良的俄罗斯人民的“人同此心”的心灵的呼声，而这也就是伟大的人民性的具体表现。
    杜勃罗留波夫曾经对儿童文学提出了一个任务——要实现“教育里的人民性”的理想，主张重视描写生活的儿童读物，特别是描写人民生活的真实的短篇小说。而盖达尔很好地用自己的作品实现了它。
    1946年，奥谢耶娃写了“爸爸的短外套”（少年儿童出版社），是一篇字数不多的短篇小说。它描叙了要上前线去作战的父亲，把一件黑丝绒的短外套给了四年级小学生的长子廖尼卡，要他在家里当家，照顾母亲和弟妹。这件露出一排银钮扣的柔软的外套还不合他的身材，然而他使自己有资格穿起来。每逢休假日在码头上工作，带回全部工资交给母亲。工作影响了学习，可是老师和同学帮助他念好了书。小说的结尾写得那么感人而有意义。爸爸空着一只袖管在轮船上跨下来，廖尼卡从人群中挤过去迎接他，一见面就性急地把自己的生活告诉他，可是给痛苦的辛酸的回忆哽住了，不得不说一会儿停一会儿。微风迎面吹来，吹起了爸爸灰色军大衣的下摆，也揭开了廖尼卡披在肩上的、爸爸的黑丝绒的短外套。
    作家以廖尼卡的光辉形象，反映了在卫国战争时期苏联好几百万少年儿童在学习技术上、在劳动生产上、在日常生活上，竭尽全力来代替上前线去的父亲和上工厂、医院去的母亲。这件短外套是父亲加在孩子身上的一种真挚的关怀，加在他身上的也是一种爱国主义思想感情的鼓励。而廖尼卡既无愧于爸爸的短外套，又无愧于学校的奖状，因为他是党、团所领导的少先队培养出来的新少年，也是党的教育方针所教导出来的好学生。
    克鲁普斯卡娅在她的“我们的儿童需要什么样的读物”中明白地说：“一个新的人的形成，……不应当是自发的，……有计划的感化是必需的，……”而奥谢耶娃就把这一新教育的原则生动地形象化了。
    苏联作家们不论在国内战争、经济建设、卫国战争以及战后建设时期，总是写那些能够帮助儿童成长和发展的，用共产主义精神来教育他们的一切事物；总是把他们带上广阔生活的道路、走向广大的天地中去打开眼界。写的是保卫社会主义祖国的红军、英雄、战士，写的是社会主义建设中的工厂、矿山、集体农庄的沸腾的斯达哈诺夫运动，写的是科学和技术上的惊人的发明和成就，写的是教师、医生、各种职业的优秀人物，写的是还有祖国的过去、现在和将来。这些，当然都是儿童文学前所未有的现象，明明白白的政治，明明白白的党性和布尔什维克主义的宣传，贯彻了儿童文学内容的思想性和党性的原则。在十月革命以前，“没有而且从来也未曾有一种文学，它是以工人阶级和农民的生活以及他们为社会主义的斗争来作为自己作品选题的基础。”（“苏联文学艺术问题”23页，人民文学出版社）而在十月革命以后，“把整个儿童文学在全新的、为着形象的科学——艺术的思维开辟最广阔的前途的原则上建立起来”（高尔基：“论主题”）了。
    我们绝对不同意儿童文学作品不可能加强政治性和毋须具有党性和人民性的那种不正确的说法。作家面临着社会主义思想体系和资产阶级思想体系正在进行生死存亡剧烈斗争的大时代，必须写出能够教育挽起袖口、积极行动的社会主义建设后备军——千百万孩子们的动人的好作品。作家的作品愈能激动读者的心灵，就愈能正确地说明问题，也就愈能鼓动读者向作品所指着的道路挺起胸脯来向前走，把个人全部的力量和热情贡献给党和人民的正义事业。
    这，只有要求儿童文学作品是社会主义现实主义的创作。也只有在社会主义现实主义的创作中，作家多种多样的天才风格及其特点才得充分发展。而社会主义现实主义的方法，使现实本身在革命发展中所带来的一切新东西得以表达出来。这在苏联儿童文学的卓越的成就上，得到了无可辩驳的事实的证明。
    如果谁还担心着强调作品的政治性和要求社会主义现实主义创作方法，是会给作品带来公式化和概念化，那么，摆在我们面前丰富多采的上百种的苏联儿童文学作品，恰恰是个有力的反证。而在这伟大的十月革命四十周年纪念，衷心地感谢苏联的作家们给我们创作了具有指导意义的观摩和学习的示范性的作品。
