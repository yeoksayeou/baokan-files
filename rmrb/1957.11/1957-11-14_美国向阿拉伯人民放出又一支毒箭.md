The United States Shoots Another Poison Arrow at the Arab People
Commentator of this newspaper

While the American ruling clique is instigating Turkey to threaten Syria, it is now also plotting a new conspiracy on the Palestine issue, shooting another poisonous arrow at the Arab people. Recently, frequent secret talks have been held between diplomats from the United States, Israel, and Jordan. Benson, the Jewish-American Secretary of Agriculture, also suddenly went to Jordan and Israel to conduct activities. News indicates that they are actively conspiring to forcibly transfer Palestinian refugees in Jordan to the southern desert areas of Jordan and Iraq.

The Palestinian refugee issue was originally a long-standing unresolved issue between Israel and the Arab countries. The Palestine War, which broke out in 1948-1949 under the instigation of imperialism, displaced nearly one million Arabs who originally lived in Palestine, leaving them homeless. Most of them fled to the West Bank of Jordan, and they have been eagerly demanding to return to their homes. However, with the support of the United States, Israel has stubbornly refused to restore the national rights of Arabs in Palestine. Now, the Washington ruling clique is colluding with the ruling groups of Israel and Jordan, attempting to decide the fate of hundreds of thousands of Arab people with a few dollars, completely depriving them of their right to return to their homes. This is obviously a barbaric trampling of the national rights of the Arabs by the United States and a crude interference in Middle Eastern affairs.

This American conspiracy has been brewing for a long time. A few months ago, when American aggressive forces were active in Jordan, U.S. Senator Humphrey publicly proposed the conspiracy plan to "transfer" Palestinian refugees. The malicious intention of the United States in driving Palestinian refugees from the West Bank to the desert areas controlled by Bedouin tribes in southern Jordan and Iraq is obvious. Everyone knows that Palestinian refugees are direct victims of imperialist aggression policies. They have strong anti-imperialist sentiments and constitute the backbone of the Jordanian national movement. Therefore, the United States has always regarded these Arab refugees as a huge obstacle to its colonial expansion in Jordan. The American transfer plan is to disperse this group of Arabs, concentrate efforts to persecute them, in order to facilitate the United States to consolidate its control over Jordan, and raise the black flag of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" on Jordanian soil. And finally pull Jordan into the Baghdad Pact Group. According to the Syrian News Agency, under the instructions of U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Benson, the Jordanian government has decided to participate in the economic committee and "anti-subversion committee" of the Baghdad Pact, and has also decided to formally accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

However, the spearhead of this American conspiracy is not only aimed at Jordan but at all the Arab people. In recent years, American imperialism has seen that the existence of the Palestinian refugee issue is increasingly becoming a factor in strengthening the unity of the Arab people, which is not conducive to the American conspiracy of dividing Arab countries and defeating them one by one. Therefore, the United States has been trying to put pressure on Arab countries. At the expense of the national interests of the Arab people, the so-called "reconciliation" between Arab countries and Israel is to be achieved. The United States first wants to force Jordan to disregard the interests of all Arab people and collude with Israel, thereby dividing Arab countries.

The current situation also shows that the American conspiracy to transfer Palestinian refugees is closely coordinated with its entire aggressive plan in the Middle East, first of all the threat to Syria. For a long time, the United States has used Turkey to carry out military threats against Syria. Although Syria has filed a complaint with the United Nations, the Turkish army still refuses to withdraw from the Syrian-Turkish border and is still carrying out large-scale mobilizations and constant provocations on the border. Turkish planes have repeatedly violated Syrian airspace. The U.S. fleet has also sailed to Lebanese and Turkish ports, directly participating in military intimidation against Syria. A few days ago, Israel also carried out provocative actions on Syria's southern border. The Syrian government has lodged a serious protest with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization. This is something that deserves serious vigilance. It can be seen that the United States is eager to use Israel to threaten Syria from the southern border of Syria.

In this conspiracy against the Arab people orchestrated by the United States, King Hussein of Jordan and the ruling clique are playing an inglorious role. Their conspiracy with the United States and Israel is actually a betrayal and sale of the national interests of the Arab people. Therefore, this cannot but arouse strong indignation and condemnation from the Jordanian and Arab people. The Jordanian people and the Arab people have clearly seen through the new conspiracy carried out by American imperialism on the Palestinian refugee issue. Recently, large-scale demonstrations have erupted in Jordan, opposing the crude interference of American imperialism in the national interests of the Arab people and opposing the treasonous acts of the Jordanian ruling clique. Large-scale demonstrations also broke out in Syria, supporting the just struggle of their Jordanian brothers. Public opinion in Arab countries such as Egypt and Syria has criticized the American intervention conspiracy. The powerful protest movement of the Arab people shows the strong unity of the Arab people and their firm will to defend the national interests of the Arabs.

Yes, the Palestinian issue should be resolved fairly. However, the affairs of the Arab nation must be decided by the Arab people themselves. They will never allow American imperialism to so rudely deprive them of their national rights and encourage Israel to threaten the security of Arab countries. The people of Arab countries will heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, mobilize all patriotic forces, and smash Washington's conspiracies and tricks!

    美国向阿拉伯人民放出又一支毒箭
    本报评论员
    美国统治集团在策动土耳其威胁叙利亚的同时，现在又在巴勒斯坦问题上策划了一个新的阴谋，向阿拉伯人民放出了又一支毒箭。最近以来，美国、以色列和约旦的外交官之间举行了频繁的秘密会谈，美国的犹太籍农业部长本逊也突然到约旦和以色列去进行活动。消息表明，他们正在积极共谋把约旦境内的巴勒斯坦难民强制迁移到约旦南部沙漠地带及伊拉克去。
    巴勒斯坦难民问题，本来是以色列和阿拉伯国家之间长期来悬而未决的问题。1948—1949年在帝国主义挑拨下爆发的巴勒斯坦战争，使得原来居住在巴勒斯坦的将近百万的阿拉伯人流离失所，无家可归。其中大部分流亡在约旦西部，他们一直迫切地要求重返家园。但是，在美国的支持下，以色列一直蛮横地拒绝恢复阿拉伯人在巴勒斯坦的民族权利。而现在华盛顿统治集团竟勾结以色列和约旦的统治集团，企图用几块美元就决定几十万阿拉伯人民的命运，完全剥夺他们返回家乡的权利。这显然是美国对于阿拉伯民族权利的野蛮蹂躏，和对于中近东事务的粗暴干涉。
    美国的这一阴谋酝酿已久。几个月以前，当美国侵略势力在约旦大肆活动的时候，美国参议员汉弗来就曾公开提出了“迁移”巴勒斯坦难民的阴谋计划。美国所以要把约旦河西岸的巴勒斯坦难民驱至约旦南部由贝都印部族所控制的沙漠地带及伊拉克去，其恶毒的用心是昭然若揭的。谁都知道，巴勒斯坦难民是帝国主义侵略政策的直接受害者，他们具有强烈的反对帝国主义的情绪，并构成约旦民族运动的中坚力量，因此，美国一直就把这些阿拉伯难民看作是它在约旦推行殖民扩张的一个巨大的障碍。美国的迁移计划，就是为了驱散这一部分阿拉伯人，集中力量对他们进行迫害，以便于美国巩固它对约旦的控制，在约旦的国土上挂起“艾森豪威尔主义”的黑旗。并且最后把约旦拉入巴格达条约集团，据叙利亚通讯社报道，按照美国农业部长本逊的指示，约旦政府已经决定参加巴格达条约的经济委员会和“反颠覆委员会”，并且也已决定正式接受“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    但是，美国这一阴谋的矛头不仅仅针对约旦，而且是针对全体阿拉伯人民的。近几年来，美帝国主义看到巴勒斯坦难民问题的存在日益成为阿拉伯人民加强团结的一个因素，而不利于美国分化阿拉伯国家，进行各个击破的阴谋。因此，美国一直企图对阿拉伯国家施加压力。在损害阿拉伯人民的民族利益的情况下，来实现阿拉伯国家和以色列之间的所谓“和解”。美国首先就是要迫使约旦不顾全体阿拉伯人民的利益，同以色列勾结起来，从而分化阿拉伯国家。
    目前的形势也说明了，美国企图迁移巴勒斯坦难民的阴谋，是同它在中东的整个侵略计划，首先是对叙利亚所进行的威胁，是密切配合的。相当长时间以来，美国利用了土耳其对叙利亚进行军事威胁。虽然叙利亚为此已向联合国提出了控诉，土耳其军队仍然拒绝撤离叙土边境，并且还在边界进行大规模的调动和不断的挑衅。土耳其的飞机一再侵犯叙利亚的领空。美国舰队也开到黎巴嫩及土耳其港口，直接参加对叙利亚的军事恫吓。前几天，以色列也在叙利亚的南部边境进行了挑衅行动。叙利亚政府已向联合国停战混合委员会提出了严正抗议。这是值得引起严重警惕的事情。可以看出，美国急于企图利用以色列，从叙利亚南部边境来威胁叙利亚。
    在美国策划的这一次进攻阿拉伯人民的阴谋中，约旦国王侯赛因和统治集团正扮演着不光采的角色。他们与美国和以色列所进行的共谋，实际上是对阿拉伯民族利益的背叛和出卖。因此，这不能不引起约旦和阿拉伯人民的强烈的愤慨和谴责。约旦人民和阿拉伯人民清楚地识破了美帝国主义在巴勒斯坦难民问题上所进行的新的阴谋。最近约旦人民爆发了大规模的示威游行，反对美帝国主义对阿拉伯民族利益的粗暴干涉，反对约旦统治集团的叛卖行为。在叙利亚也爆发了声势浩大的游行示威，支持他们的约旦兄弟的正义斗争。埃及、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家的公众舆论纷纷抨击美国的干涉阴谋。阿拉伯人民的强大的抗议运动表明了阿拉伯人民的坚强的团结和他们保卫阿拉伯民族利益的坚决的意志。
    是的，巴勒斯坦问题是应该得到公正解决的。但是，阿拉伯民族的事务必须由阿拉伯人民自己来决定。他们决不容许美帝国主义这样粗暴地剥夺他们的民族权利，并鼓励以色列威胁阿拉伯国家的安全。阿拉伯各国人民将提高警惕，加强团结，动员一切爱国力量，粉碎华盛顿的阴谋诡计！
