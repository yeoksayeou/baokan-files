    The big-character poster, a suggestion from within the upsurge of the big contending and big blooming campaign in the Capital Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, saved the state 1.1 million yuan.

    In the past, this bureau over-ordered construction machinery from domestic and foreign sources every year, resulting in stockpiles. This big-character poster addressed this situation, suggesting a re-examination of the construction plan for the coming year. This suggestion was immediately accepted by the leadership, and under the personal impetus of the bureau chief, the entire order plan was reviewed within four days, saving the state construction machinery worth 1.1 million yuan.

    A big-character poster posted on November 10 suggesting a re-examination of the 1958 construction machinery budget.

    Bureau Chief Liu Bingzhi (first on the left) personally leads the leaders of various units to review the budget item by item.

    The review results, saving the state more than one million yuan, were announced in the "Correcting While Rectifying" column on November 14. The staff and workers are all excited to see this big-character poster.

    Bureau Chief Liu Bingzhi (left) and Wang Yufu (center), Secretary of the Party Committee of the Capital Construction Bureau, praised Zou Mingrong, the author of the big-character poster, to his face, encouraging him to continue to contend and bloom and vigorously help the leadership improve its work.
