    What a Huge Train Ferry!
    China's largest train ferry, the "Shanghai," was recently launched in Shanghai. It was designed and manufactured by the famous Jiangnan Shipyard.
    The "Shanghai" ferry resembles an aircraft carrier in shape, with a total length of 118.7 meters and a displacement of 4,950 tons. The main deck is paved with three railway tracks, allowing it to carry fifteen passenger cars or thirty freight cars across the river in one trip.
    This train ferry will soon operate on the Yangtze River between Nanjing and Pukou. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Raw Material for Manufacturing "Capron"
    The raw material for manufacturing synthetic fiber "Capron" has been successfully tested at the Shenyang Chemical Research Institute.
    "Capron" is made from benzene, a by-product of coking. Benzene is first made into carbolic acid, and then subjected to chemical reactions step by step, finally resulting in "synthetic fiber." The Soviet Union calls this fiber "Capron," and the United States calls it "Nylon 6." (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Barge for Pigs
    A new type of semi-automated pig barge, a transportation tool for long-distance pig transport on water, has been successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Joint State-Private New Construction Shipyard.
    This pig barge has a large pig feed kitchen equipped with three water-tight steamers specifically for steaming fine pig feed, and two automatic distribution and conveying devices. Pig feed can automatically flow into each pig feed trough. Each deck is equipped with pig manure troughs, which regularly transport the manure in the troughs to eight pig manure compartments for storage.
    This pig barge can transport 2,600 live pigs at a time. (Yang Renzhang)

    好大的火车渡轮！
    我国最大的一艘火车渡轮——“上海号”，最近在上海下水。它是由著名的江南造船厂设计制造的。
    “上海号”渡轮的外形像一艘航空母舰，全长一百一十八点七公尺，排水量达四千九百五十吨。主甲板上铺有三道铁轨，一次就可以载运十五节客车或三十节货车过江。
    这艘火车轮渡不久将行驶在南京与浦口之间的长江上。　（据新华社讯）
    制造“卡普隆”的原料
    制造合成纤维“卡普隆”的原料，已经在沈阳化工研究院试验成功。
    “卡普隆”是由炼焦副产品——苯做成的。苯，首先做成石炭酸，然后再一步步地进行化学反应，最后得出来“合成纤维”。苏联称这种纤维为“卡普隆”，美国称为“尼龙六”。（据新华社讯）
    猪坐的驳船
    一种在水上长途运猪的运输工具——半自动化新型猪驳，已由上海公私合营新建船舶修造厂试制成功。
    这艘猪驳有一个宽大的猪饲厨房，里面装着三个专门蒸煮猪饲细料的水汀蒸锅，和两个自动分配输送的设备。猪食可以自动流入各道猪饲槽去。各层甲板上都装有猪粪槽，它们按时会把槽里的粪输送到全船八个猪粪舱去贮存。
    这种猪驳，每次能运活猪二千六百头。　（杨仁章）
