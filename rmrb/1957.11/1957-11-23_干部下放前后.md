Before and After Cadre Downward Transfer
By Our Correspondent

    Not long ago, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, with a revolutionary spirit, resolutely streamlined its management structure. Now, with revolutionary action, they have transferred more than a thousand cadres to various labor fronts.
    Our country is a socialist country, a country where the working people are the masters. The working cadres of this country should not only understand the importance of labor, but also be tempered through labor and possess the thoughts and feelings of the working people. Precisely because of this, the Party and the government have put forward the requirements of "being able to go up and down, being able to be cadres and also workers and peasants" to all cadres; and issued the call to "go to the labor front, participate in labor production, temper oneself, and transform oneself."
    However, not all cadres understand this principle very clearly. Some people say that labor is glorious, but when the issue is placed before them, and they are required to make a major change in action, they are full of worries and hesitate.
    Because of these circumstances, mobilizing cadres to go to the labor front and carrying out political and ideological work in this regard is an arduous and complex task.
    The experience of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant confirms this point. But the experience of this plant also tells us that as long as all aspects of the work are done well, although the task is arduous, significant results can still be achieved in the end.
    Among the experiences of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, three points are particularly worth mentioning.
    The first point is: It is necessary to tirelessly explain to the cadres who are about to go to the labor front why they are being transferred and whether the transfer of cadres is glorious. To explain this principle clearly, first and foremost, it is required that the leaders of each unit have a correct understanding of this great revolutionary action.
    The reason why we want to streamline institutions and transfer cadres is because many enterprise institutions are bloated, and there are too many people doing too little, which is extremely detrimental to the development of construction and production. At the same time, in rural areas, due to the large-scale construction of farmland infrastructure, many places have felt a shortage of manpower and need to draw people from the cities to support them. At the same time, it is also because cadres participating in labor training, transforming and improving themselves through labor, is a fundamental policy of our country's cadre policy in the future.
    As long as the enterprise leaders thoroughly recognize the important significance of cadre transfer, they will creatively carry out political and ideological work in this great revolutionary action. If the above principles are explained to the cadres who are preparing to be transferred in light of the specific circumstances of the enterprise, the vast majority of cadres will also support the policy of downward transfer. The examples of many enterprise cadres actively signing up for downward transfer have already proved this point.
    The second noteworthy experience of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is that the great debate on cadre transfer and ideological mobilization should be combined with solving specific problems.
    It should be seen that when each cadre is preparing to accept the task of downward transfer, they will inevitably consider many issues and inevitably produce many ideological problems. Changing from mental work to mainly physical labor, from the office to the fields, construction sites, and workshops, from the city to the countryside, living habits, working environment, and labor conditions will all change. Moreover, from the perspective of individual transferred cadres, everyone has their own problems. For example, single people will consider the issue of finding a partner, couples who are transferred together will consider issues such as their children's schooling, entering nurseries, and feeding; there are also issues such as the man going down and the woman staying, or the woman going down and the man staying; there are pregnant women, weak people, and people with chronic illnesses, etc., each person will raise their own different difficulties and demands. Therefore, after the great debate and the mobilization report, while distinguishing between right and wrong, individual talks should be conducted, soliciting opinions again and again. In the process of the talks, problems that can be solved should be helped to be solved immediately; problems that cannot be solved should also be explained and accounted for. The experience of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant proves that people who have undergone such work are active in labor, determined, and confident after going to the countryside.
    Of course, when solving specific problems, the focus is still on solving ideological problems. Many problems arise mostly from insufficient understanding. When it is necessary to solve some material difficulties, it is also necessary to adhere to principles and not make promises easily. They must be told that, under the current circumstances, generally speaking, the living standards of cadres are higher than the living standards of workers and peasants, especially higher than the living standards of peasants. If the requirements are too high, and going to the countryside to eat and live with the peasants is too far apart, they will become divorced from the masses. However, when encountering such problems, attention must be paid to being patient when explaining and speaking tactfully. Because the formation of these ideological problems is related to the past practice of being "taken care of" by the state for a long time. In the past, if there was nothing, they expected the public to take care of them. Now that they are required to rely on their own efforts, some people are not so accustomed to it at first. To change this dependence of thought will take time.
    The third point worth mentioning is that the relationship between the transferred cadres and the enterprise has been handled relatively well by the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. In principle, after the cadres are transferred from the enterprise, in addition to maintaining a spiritual connection because they have worked in the original enterprise and have contributed to production and construction, there does not seem to be any other relationship. However, the transfer of cadres to the labor front cannot be completely equated with general job transfers. The transfer of cadres to the labor front is the need of our country's current construction situation. The original enterprise must not only ensure that they have full enthusiasm when they are transferred, but also should support them in creating new labor achievements in their new posts; for comrades who have gone to the countryside, they must also find ways to help them settle down and establish themselves in the cooperatives. This is a responsibility. In addition, they have just gone down, especially those who have gone to the countryside, and cannot achieve economic independence all at once. Their wages are still paid by the original enterprise, which is a period of transition. In this way, the connection with the enterprise is required to be closer. Comrades who have just gone down will inevitably encounter some difficulties and inconveniences. Although these difficulties and inconveniences are temporary, as long as they get used to it, some of what are now considered difficulties will no longer be problems in the future; but after all, these difficulties need people to help them solve. Maintaining a certain connection between the enterprise and them is essential to consolidate their confidence and determination, help them overcome difficulties, and establish the idea of long-term labor. The practice of the leaders of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant taking turns to go down regularly to help solve problems is worth promoting. Of course, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has special favorable conditions. The rural areas where the transferred cadres have gone are close to the factory site, making it convenient to come and go. However, even if it is far from the factory, as long as a responsible attitude is taken towards the transferred cadres, and with the cooperation of the local Party organization, it is entirely possible to come up with other ways to contact and work.
    Transferring cadres to the labor front is a revolutionary action of historical significance. Doing this work well with a creative spirit is a glorious task entrusted to each enterprise Party organization by the Party. In this regard, many experiences have been gained in various places. We believe that in future work, more and better experiences will emerge.

    干部下放前后
    本报评论员
    不久以前，石景山钢铁厂用革命的精神，下决心紧缩了管理机构，现在他们又用革命的行动，把抽调出来的一千多名干部，下放到了各个劳动战线上去。
    我们的国家是社会主义国家，是劳动人民当家作主的国家。这个国家的工作干部，不仅应该懂得劳动的重要意义，而且要经过劳动的锻炼，具有劳动人民的思想感情。正由于这样，党和政府向所有的干部提出了“能上能下，既能当干部又能当工人、农民”的要求；提出了“到劳动战线上去，参加劳动生产，锻炼自己，改造自己”的号召。
    然而，这个道理并不是所有的干部都理解得十分清楚的。有些人口头上也说劳动光荣，但当问题摆在他们面前，要求他们在行动上来一个大变革时，就顾虑重重，踌躇不前。
    正由于存在这些情况，因此，动员干部到劳动战线上去，和进行这方面的政治思想工作，是一项艰巨的复杂的任务。
    石景山钢铁厂的经验证实了这一点。但是，这个厂的经验也告诉我们，只要把各方面的工作做好，任务虽然艰巨，最后仍然可以取得显著的成绩。
    石景山钢铁厂的经验当中，值得特别提出的有三点。
    第一点是：必须不厌其烦地向将要到劳动战线上去的干部讲清楚为什么要下放，下放干部是不是光荣。而要讲清楚这个道理，首先，也是主要的，要求每个单位的领导人对这个伟大的革命行动有正确的认识。
    我们所以要紧缩机构，下放干部，是因为许多企业机构臃肿，人浮于事，对建设和生产事业的发展极为不利。同时也因为在农村，由于大量进行农田基本建设，许多地方已经感到人力不足，需要由城市抽人去支援。同时，也因为干部参加劳动锻炼，从劳动中改造自己、提高自己，是今后我们国家干部政策中的一条根本方针。
    只要企业领导人员彻底认清干部下放的重要意义，就会在这个伟大的革命行动中，创造性地进行政治思想工作。如果把上述道理，结合本企业的具体情况，向准备下放的干部说透了，绝大多数干部也都会拥护下放的方针。许多企业干部踊跃报名下放的事例已经证明了这一点。
    石景山钢铁厂第二个值得注意的经验是：进行干部下放的大辩论，进行思想动员，应当和解决具体问题相结合。
    应当看到，当每个干部在准备接受下放任务的时候，必然会考虑许多问题，也必然会产生许多思想问题。从脑力劳动转变到以体力为主的劳动，从办公室走向田间、工地、车间，从城市到农村，生活习惯、工作环境、劳动条件都会发生变化。而且，就下放干部个人来看，每个人都有各自的问题。例如，单身汉会考虑谈恋爱找对象的问题，夫妇双方一起下放的，会考虑孩子上学、进托儿所、吃奶等问题；还有男方下女方留，或是女方下男方留的问题；有怀孕的，有体弱的，有慢性病症的等等，各人会提出各自不同的困难和要求。因此，在经过大辩论，做过动员报告以后，在分清了大是非的同时，就要进行个别谈话，一次再次的征求意见。在谈话过程中，能解决的问题，马上就帮助解决；不能解决，也要经过解释，有个交代。石景山钢铁厂的经验证明：凡是经过这样工作的人，下到农村以后，劳动积极，决心大，信心也足。
    当然，在解决具体问题的时候，仍然是以解决思想问题为主。许多问题的产生，多半是由认识不足引起的。不得已必须解决一些物质方面的困难，也要坚持原则，不要轻易许愿。要告诉他们，在目前的情况下，一般说来，干部的生活水平是高过工农生活水平的，特别是高过农民的生活水平。如果要求过高，下乡和农民同吃同住，相距太远，就会脱离群众。不过，在碰到这样问题时，必须注意解释时要有耐心，说话要婉转。因为这些思想问题的形成是同过去长期由国家“包下来”的做法有关的。在过去，没有，就指望公家包，现在要求自力更生了，一开始有些人还不是那么习惯。要改变这种依赖思想，还要经过一段过程。
    第三点值得提出的是：干部下放以后，他们和企业的关系，石景山钢铁厂是处理得比较好的。照道理说，干部调离企业以后，除了因为他们在原企业工作过，对生产建设有过贡献，今后仍然保持精神上的联系以外，似乎不应该再有什么其他的关系了。可是，干部下放到劳动战线上去，和一般的工作调动不能完全等同起来看。干部下放到劳动战线上去，这是我国当前建设形势的需要，原企业不仅要保证他们下放时有饱满的情绪，而且还应当支持他们在新的岗位上创造出新的劳动成绩；对下到农村去的同志们，还要设法帮助他们在合作社里安家立业。这是一种责任。另外，他们是刚下去，特别是去农村的，经济上还不能一下子就获得独立，工资还由原企业支付，这是一段过渡时期。这样，和企业的联系就要求比较密切了。刚下去的同志，还必然会碰到一些困难和不方便，虽说这些困难和不方便是短暂的，只要习惯了，某些现在认为是困难的，将来也就不成为问题了；但毕竟这些困难是要人去帮他们解决的。企业和他们保持一定的联系，这对巩固他们的信心和决心，帮助他们克服困难，树立长期劳动下去的思想，还是少不了的。石景山钢铁厂由领导人轮流定期下去帮助解决问题的做法是值得推广的。当然石景山钢铁厂有特殊的有利条件，下放干部所去的农村距厂址较近，来去方便。但是，即使距工厂较远，只要对下放干部采取负责到底的态度，在当地党组织的合作下，也完全有可能想出其他的办法来进行联系和进行工作。
    下放干部到劳动战线上去，这是一件有历史意义的革命行动。用创造性的精神做好这件工作，是党交给每个企业党组织的光荣任务。在这方面各地已经取得了不少的经验。我们相信，在今后的工作中，将会出现更多更好的经验。
