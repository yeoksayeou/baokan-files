(Our Dispatch) The achievements of the Ministry of Geology's petroleum prospecting work over the past three years have confirmed that our country's petroleum resources are very promising.

With the cooperation of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Geology has carried out petroleum prospecting in an area of nearly two million square kilometers over the past three years, discovering 256 possible oil-bearing structures. During the drilling process, oil gushed from the Leng Hu No. 4 structure in the Qaidam Basin, confirming that it has industrially valuable oil flow. Recently, crude oil has also been drilled in the Mahai structure. In the central part of the Sichuan Basin, the gentle and huge Longnüsi structure has already yielded crude oil twice in this year's drilling. In the most recent drilling, the shallow oil layer encountered at 300 meters can collect 100 kilograms per day and night. Natural gas has been discovered in the Guangfuping and Lizhitan structures in southern Sichuan during structural drilling. The southern Sichuan area is now considered a natural gas area with industrial value. In addition, oil and gas shows have also been seen in drilling in the northern part of the Ordos prairie in Inner Mongolia and eastern Guizhou. The North China Plain and the Songliao Plain both have superior geological conditions, with potential oil-bearing buried structures beneath the plains. Large-scale drilling and geophysical exploration are underway, and the oil-bearing prospects of these plains will be gradually confirmed. All of these will provide favorable conditions for the development of our country's petroleum industry.

Over the past three years, geological workers have worked in many unexplored and remote areas where no geological surveys had been conducted, collecting extremely rich geological data of various kinds. In particular, they have provided many new and significant data on stratigraphy, geotectonics, and geological development history. For example, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was almost entirely a geological blank area in the past. Over the past three years, regional geology of the Qaidam Basin, the Kunlun Mountains, the Kekexili Mountains, the Tanggula Mountains, and the Heihe area in northern Tibet has been further understood, creating conditions for future research on the geological structure of these areas and the search for various useful minerals. A preliminary understanding has also been gained of the geological structure of the deeply covered North China Plain and Songliao Plain.

The amount of work completed by geological workers in the past three years has also been enormous, including: 600,000 square kilometers of 1:1,000,000 geological reconnaissance, and 400,000 square kilometers of 1:200,000 geological surveying. Prospecting and structural drilling totaled approximately 100,000 meters, in addition to a large amount of geophysical exploration, geodetic and topographic surveying, aerial geology, and geochemical exploration.

    我国石油资源大有希望
    地质部三年来发现了可能储油构造二百五十六个
    本报讯　地质部三年来石油普查工作的成果，证实了我国的石油资源大有希望。
    在石油工业部的协作下，地质部三年来在将近二百万平方公里的地区开展了石油普查，发现了可能储油构造二百五十六个。在钻探过程中，柴达木盆地冷湖四号构造发生了油喷，证实了是有工业价值的油流。最近在马海构造上也钻探到原油。在四川盆地的中部，平缓而又巨大的龙女寺构造在今年的钻探中，已经见到两次原油，最近的钻探中，在三百公尺处所遇到的浅油层，每昼夜可收集一百公斤。川南的广福坪构造、荔枝滩构造在构造钻探中都发现了天然气。川南地区已被认为是具有工业价值的天然气区。此外，在内蒙古鄂尔多斯草原的北部，贵州东部等地区的钻探中，也见到了油气显示。华北平原和松辽平原都具有优越的地质条件，平原下部有着可能储油的潜伏构造，大量的钻探工作和地球物理勘探工作正在进行，这些平原的含油远景将被逐步证实。所有这些，都将为我国发展石油工业提供有利条件。
    三年来，地质工作者们在许多从未作过地质调查的空白区和偏远地区进行工作，收集了极为丰富的各种地质资料。特别对地层、大地构造、地质发育史等方面，提供了许多新的有意义的资料。例如，青藏高原过去几乎全部是地质空白区，三年来，对柴达木盆地、昆仑山、可可稀里山、唐古拉山、西藏北部黑河地区的区域地质有了进一步的了解，为今后研究这些区域的地质构造和寻找各种有用矿产创造了条件。对掩盖深厚的华北平原和松辽平原的地质构造情况也有了初步了解。
    三年来，地质工作者所完成的工作量也是十分巨大的，计有：百万分之一地质概查六十万平方公里，二十万分之一地质测量四十万平方公里。普查和构造钻探约十万公尺，此外还有大量的地球物理勘探，大地、地形测量，航空地质、地球化学勘探等。
