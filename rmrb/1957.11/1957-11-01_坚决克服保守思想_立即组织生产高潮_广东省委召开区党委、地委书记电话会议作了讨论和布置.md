Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 31st, special dispatch by our newspaper reporter Du Daozheng: At the telephone conference of district and prefectural party committee secretaries held by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee on the night of the 28th, everyone estimated that the current situation in the rural areas of Guangdong Province is: "Everything is ready, only the east wind is lacking." As long as all party cadres resolutely implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session and make another great effort, an unprecedented winter production upsurge can be organized immediately. The meeting was presided over by Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee.

	The mass conditions for organizing a production upsurge are fully ripe; the key lies in leadership
	The reports at the meeting indicated that the rural situation after the socialist debate is as follows: the political enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants is very high, and they are eager to organize winter production; the tendency of the well-to-do middle peasants to take the socialist road has also increased. In terms of mass conditions, the time to organize a winter production upsurge is fully ripe. Twenty thousand co-ops across the province are participating in the first batch of rectification campaigns, and the great debate is about to end; more than twenty thousand co-ops are participating in the second batch of rectification campaigns, and the great debate has also been fully launched in recent days. The progress of the debate and rectification varies, and the effects differ, but the fact that the peasants, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, have strengthened their belief in the Party and their reliance on the co-ops after the great debate is universally certain. The poor and lower-middle peasants universally demand that the cooperatives immediately do a good job in winter production to increase income and improve their lives. Du Ruizhi, Secretary of the Foshan Prefectural Party Committee, told a story about a well-to-do middle peasant holding banknotes to buy night soil from a poor peasant. But the poor peasant shook his head and said, "I don't care about your cash, the night soil has already been sold to my cooperative." The comrades participating in the meeting also said that many such moving stories have occurred in the organization of winter production in various places. For example, when building water conservancy projects and expanding the winter planting area, our cadres always said that it could not be done, but before they finished speaking, the masses did it better. The enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants, stirred up by the great debate, is very high. It should be given sufficient estimation and should be protected and promoted tenfold. Our Party's current responsibility is to organize the winter production upsurge and immediately mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses.
	The meeting pointed out that there are many conditions for organizing this year's winter production that are much better than in previous years, such as the huge impact of the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China’s Third Plenary Session and the Forty-Article Agricultural Development Program, the increase in national investment in agricultural production and construction, and the fact that cadres have more experience in organizing winter production. In addition, the early deployment of winter production this year is very beneficial. Last year and the year before last, the work started late. For example, planting winter wheat after the season affected the yield. This year, it can be planted in a timely manner, and the harvest will naturally be better.

	The right-leaning conservative thinking of cadres is the biggest "enemy" in organizing a production upsurge.
	The meeting believed that the biggest "enemy" in organizing the current winter production upsurge is still the right-leaning conservative thinking of many leading organs and leading cadres. In the previous period, this "enemy" was more severe. After a series of meetings for criticism and education, it has subsided somewhat, but it has not been completely resolved. The Secretary of the Foshan Prefectural Party Committee said that many cadres still treat winter production with a "hard mouth and a soft heart." They shout "upsurge, upsurge" but think "low tide, low tide" in their hearts; they say that winter planting can reach 10,000 mu, but they are murmuring that it cannot be completed. Chairman Mao once said that if we do not trust the Party and do not trust the masses, then we will not be able to accomplish anything. The meeting pointed out that this part of the leading organs and leading cadres are suffering from a disease of distrust. They do not trust the Party, they do not trust the majority of the peasant masses, and they especially do not trust the poor and lower-middle peasant masses, so they are always lacking in energy. This kind of distrust is the result of being divorced from reality and the masses, and it is the result of not delving into work. A prefectural party committee secretary used the example to satirize a cadre who did not delve into work enough, saying, "We have a cadre who went to the cooperative to see if the winter wheat was growing well. The cooperative cadres did not show him the wheat that was growing well, which could yield 230 jin per mu; instead, they led him around in the worst wheat field, where the wheat could only yield 40 jin per mu. This cadre was deceived, but he went around saying that the winter wheat was planted poorly and could no longer be planted." The meeting pointed out that many of our cadres lack confidence in winter production because they have similar shortcomings to this deceived cadre. They often do not conduct investigations or specific analyses of the achievements and shortcomings of previous winter production due to a lack of in-depth work, and they draw erroneous conclusions that do not conform to reality or violate the interests of the masses.

	Holding a good oath-taking rally for activists is a good way to overcome the right-leaning thinking of cadres.
	The meeting unanimously agreed that holding an oath-taking rally for winter production activists with tens of thousands of participants would further solve the problem of cadres' right-leaning conservative thinking to a considerable extent. And whether the activists' meeting is held well or not depends entirely on whether the mass line and form of great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate can be adopted. The local party committees and county party committees of Guangdong Province are holding and will hold meetings with one or two thousand activists participating in each, to implement the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session, discuss the Forty-Article Agricultural Development Program, and conduct a great mobilization for winter production. It is estimated that tens of thousands of cadres will participate throughout the province. Comrade Tao Zhu emphasized in his conclusion that this meeting is very important and must be held well, and it must not be held poorly. The only way to hold it well is to organize a mass debate, discuss the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session and the Forty-Article Agricultural Development Program, and then, according to its spirit, debate whether winter production should be carried out? Should it be carried out on a large scale or a small scale? How should it be carried out? In the great debate, advanced ideas, advanced experiences, advanced individuals, and units are discovered and commended, and right-leaning conservative thinking is exposed and criticized.

	To boost morale and launch a production upsurge, we must rely on the great debate.
	Comrade Tao Zhu said that boosting the morale of cadres depends on the great debate, and organizing the winter production upsurge of the peasant masses also depends on the great debate. He said that great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate are the mass line. This is a new creation of our Party's mass line, and it is our basic working method in the future. In the future, no matter what work we are doing, we must learn to use this working method.
	Comrade Tao Zhu also pointed out that the current rectification of cooperatives in rural areas should revolve around the general theme of doing a good job in the cooperative's winter production, organizing a great airing of views, a great blooming, a great debate, and a great rectification. The first batch of cooperatives undergoing rectification that have reached the fourth step should guide the masses to conduct a great airing of views, a great blooming, and a great debate under the requirement of how to do a good job in production and run the cooperative well, launch a winter production upsurge, and formulate winter planting plans and next year's production plans as much as possible to further implement the "three guarantees" and improve production management; the first batch of cooperatives that have not reached the fourth step and the newly launched second batch of cooperatives should also organize a great airing of views, a great blooming, and a great debate, with doing a good job in winter production as the center, improve their work, formulate winter production plans, and quickly grasp the various tasks of winter production.
	At the end of the meeting, Comrade Tao Zhu called on everyone, saying that the rural areas of Guangdong, after several months of socialist debate and rectification, are capable of organizing a larger-scale winter production upsurge and achieving a great economic leap forward. Now, the huge winter production task targets have been set by everyone. We must ensure that the winter planting area reaches 20 million mu, water conservancy construction benefits 10 million mu, afforestation is carried out on 10 million mu, soil improvement is carried out on 8 million mu, and 10,000 jin of fertilizer is accumulated per mu of cultivated land. However, to turn these figures on paper into the actions of millions of people and into reality, we still need to do extremely arduous work, and difficulties can be foreseen. This requires us to better trust the masses, mobilize the masses, and rely on the masses, while strengthening the leadership of the Party and arranging the work well.
	Comrade Tao Zhu finally emphasized that all cadres at all levels who have gone to the countryside should continue to persist in helping to thoroughly rectify the cooperatives and quickly launch a winter production upsurge; he also requested party and government organs at all levels to send more cadres to work in the countryside in the near future. Comrade Tao Zhu called on the cadres to go to the countryside as they did in the winter of 1955; and suggested that the local garrisons spare time from drills and Sundays to actively help the masses in winter production.

    坚决克服保守思想  立即组织生产高潮
    广东省委召开区党委、地委书记电话会议作了讨论和布置
    本报特约新华社广州31日电　新华社记者杜导正报道：28日夜，中共广东省委召开的区党委、地委书记电话会议上，大家估计说：当前广东省农村的形势是：“万事俱备，只欠东风”，只要全党干部坚决根据三中全会精神，再使一大把劲，一个空前规模的冬季生产高潮就能够立刻组织起来。会议由省委第一书记陶铸同志主持。
      组织生产高潮的群众条件完全成熟，关键在于领导
    会议上的汇报表明，经过社会主义大辩论的农村情况是：贫苦农民群众的政治积极性很高，迫切地要求组织冬季生产，富裕中农走社会主义道路的倾向也增强了。从群众条件上说，组织冬季生产高潮的时机完全成熟了。全省参加第一批整风的有两万个社，大辩论就要结束；参加第二批整风的也有两万多个社，大辩论也已在近日全面铺开。辩论和整风的进度快慢不同，效果大小有别，但是农民群众，尤其是贫苦农民群众，经过大辩论后，相信党，依靠社的观念已有加强，却是普遍的确定的事实。贫苦农民群众普遍地要求合作社立刻搞好冬季生产，以增加收入改善生活。佛山地委书记杜瑞之讲了一个故事，说有个富裕中农，手里拿着钞票向一个贫农买家肥。但是贫农摇摇头说，我不稀罕你的现款，家肥已经卖给我的合作社了。参加会议的同志们还说，各地组织冬季生产中，还发生过许多这样的动人事例，如办水利，扩大冬种面积，我们干部总说办不到、办不到，话犹未了，群众一办就超过了。这种贫苦农民群众的由大辩论鼓动起来的干劲是很高的。应该给以足够估计，应该十倍的加以保护和发扬。我们党现在的责任，就是组织冬季生产高潮，把广大群众这种积极性立刻调动起来。
    会议指出，组织今年冬季生产，还有许多比往年好得多的条件。如八届三中全会决议和四十条农业发展纲要的巨大影响，国家对农业生产建设投资的增加，干部组织冬季生产比较有经验。此外今年冬季生产布置得早，好处很大。去年和前年动手晚了，譬如种冬小麦时候过了节令，影响了收益，今年能够适时下种，收获自然好些。
  干部的右倾保守思想是当前组织生产高潮的最大“敌人”
    会议认为，当前组织冬季生产高潮的最大“敌人”，仍然是不少领导机关和领导干部的右倾保守思想。前一个时期，这个“敌人”更厉害些，经过一连串会议的批判教育，现在收敛些，但是并未彻底解决。佛山地委书记说，许多干部对待冬季生产仍然是“口硬心软”，嘴里喊说高潮高潮，心里想的仍然是低潮低潮；嘴里说，冬种能达一万亩，心里却在嘀咕完不成。毛主席曾经说过，如果不信任党，不信任群众，那么，我们便什么事也办不成了。会议指出，这部分领导机关和领导干部就是害了不信任病，一不信任党，二不信任农民群众的多数，特别不信任贫苦农民群众，所以总是劲头不足。这种不信任，是脱离实际脱离群众的结果，是工作不深入的结果。一个地委书记举例挖苦一个工作不够深入的干部说，我们有个干部到社去看冬种小麦长得好不好，社的干部不给他看长得好的小麦，长得好的小麦一亩能收二百三十斤；偏偏领着他在长得最坏的麦田里兜圈，这里的小麦一亩只能收四十斤。这个干部被骗了，但他却到处说种冬小麦种坏了，再不能种了。会议指出，我们不少干部对冬季生产缺少信心，便是因为有类似这个被骗干部的缺点所造成的。他们往往因为工作不深入，对以往冬季生产成绩和缺点，不加调查，不加具体分析，得出不符合实际和违反群众利益的错误结论。
    开好积极分子誓师大会，是克服干部右倾思想的好办法
    会议一致认为，开好有十几万人参加的积极分子冬季生产誓师大会，会在相当程度上进一步解决干部思想右倾保守的问题。而积极分子大会开得好坏，又完全决定于能否采用大鸣大放大辩论的群众路线和形式。中共广东省各地委各县委，正在召开和将要召开各有一两千积极分子参加的大会，贯彻三中全会决议，讨论四十条农业发展纲要，进行冬季生产大动员。全省估计有十几万干部参加。陶铸同志在做结论时，强调地说，这个会关系很大，只许开好，不许开坏。开好的唯一办法是组织群众性的大辩论，讨论三中全会决议和四十条农业发展纲要，然后根据它的精神，辩论冬季生产应该不应该搞？大搞还是小搞？怎样搞？在大辩论中，发现和表扬先进思想先进经验先进人物和单位，揭露和批判右倾保守思想。
      要鼓起干劲，要掀起生产高潮，都要靠大辩论
    陶铸同志说，把干部的干劲鼓起来靠大辩论，组织农民群众冬季生产的高潮，也要靠大辩论。他说，大鸣大放大辩论，就是群众路线，这是我们党的群众路线的新创造，是我们今后的基本工作方法，今后无论进行什么工作，都要学会运用这个工作方法。
    陶铸同志还指出说，目前农村整社，应该围绕着搞好合作社的冬季大生产这个总题目，去组织大鸣大放大辩论大整改。进行整风的第一批社已进到第四步的，应引导群众在如何搞好生产，办好社的要求下，进行大鸣大放大辩论，把冬季生产高潮掀起来，订出冬种计划与明年生产计划尽可能进一步贯彻“三包”与搞好生产管理；第一批社未进到第四步的以及新铺开的第二批社，亦均应以搞好冬季生产为中心，组织大鸣大放大辩论，改进工作，把冬季生产计划订出，迅速把冬季生产的各项工作抓起来。
    会议结束时，陶铸同志号召说，经过几个月的社会主义大辩论和整风的广东农村，是能够组织起规模更大的冬季生产高潮，来一个经济上的大跃进的。现在，巨大的冬季生产任务指标数字大家已经定下来了，我们一定要保证冬种面积达到二千万亩，兴修水利受益面积一千万亩，造林一千万亩，改良土壤八百万亩，每亩耕地积肥一万斤。但是，这些纸面上的数字，要变成千百万群众的行动，变成现实，那还要做极艰苦的工作，困难是可以预感到的，这要求我们更好地相信群众，发动群众和依靠群众，同时加强党的领导，很好地安排工作。
    陶铸同志最后强调说，所有已下乡的各级干部应该继续坚持下去，帮助彻底把社整好，迅速掀起冬季生产高潮；还要求各级党政机关，在最近派更多的干部下乡工作。陶铸同志号召干部像1955年冬天那样下乡去；并建议各地驻军抽出操课空余时间和星期天，就近积极地帮助群众进行冬季生产。
