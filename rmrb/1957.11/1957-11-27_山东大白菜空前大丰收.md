    Shandong Cabbage Achieves Unprecedented Bumper Harvest
    This year, Shandong Province has achieved the highest cabbage yield in its history. The average yield per mu for the province's 270,000 mu of cabbage is expected to reach approximately 7,500 jin, with a total output exceeding 2 billion jin. In the famous production area of Jiaoxian County, the highest unit yield of the 15,000 mu of "Jiao Bai" cabbage reached 30,000 jin.
    Since the beginning of this month, agricultural cooperatives in Jiaoxian, Laiwu, and other places have been successively sending first-class cabbage to state purchasing stations, from where it will be transported to places such as the Greater Khingan Mountains, Anshan, Beijing, and Shanghai. This winter and next spring, Shandong Province will supply approximately 150 million jin of cabbage to other provinces.
    Shandong Province is one of China's vegetable production bases. According to records, Shandong cabbage has a history of more than 500 years. It has always been famous throughout the country for its large size, tight heart, long storage time, few fibers, and rich nutrition. (Xinhua News Agency text and photograph by Xia Shurang)

    山东大白菜空前大丰收
    山东省大白菜今年获得了历史上最高产量。全省二十七万亩白菜的平均每亩产量预计可达七千五百斤左右，总产量在二十亿斤以上。著名产地胶县种植的一万五千亩“胶白”，最高单位产量达到三万斤。
    从这个月初开始，胶县、莱芜等地农业社已陆续把头等白菜送到国家收购站，运往大兴安岭、鞍山、北京、上海等地。今冬明春，山东省将供应外省约一亿五千万斤的大白菜。
    山东省是我国蔬菜生产基地之一。据资料记载，山东大白菜已有五百年以上的历史，它一直以株大、包心紧、贮存时间长、纤维少和富于营养闻名于全国。（新华社文、夏树让摄）
