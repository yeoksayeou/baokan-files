    At the Beijing Garden Party
    Mayor Peng Zhen's Speech
    Dear Comrade Andreyev, Comrades, Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen:
    Today, people from all walks of life in Beijing are holding a joyous garden party here to welcome the Soviet delegation from all walks of life, headed by Comrade Andreyev, who are participating in the Chinese people's celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.
    Just as we are warmly celebrating the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet delegation from all walks of life participating in the Chinese people's celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution has arrived in Beijing, bringing with them the deep friendship of the great Soviet people. On behalf of all the people of Beijing and the people of the whole country, I extend my most sincere and warm welcome, gratitude, and congratulations to Comrade Andreyev, the head of the delegation, and all the comrades of the delegation.
    Today, we have also invited the heads of diplomatic missions to our country, Soviet experts in Beijing and their wives, as well as other distinguished guests from various countries in Beijing to participate in today's garden party. We extend our warm welcome and gratitude to them.
    The October Revolution opened a new era in human history. The light of the October Revolution illuminates the path to liberation for the exploited people and oppressed nations all over the world. Over the past forty years, under the wise leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, the Soviet people have overcome numerous difficulties and obstacles, achieved great victories in the armed intervention against imperialists and in the Second World War, and have made great achievements in economic and cultural construction, as well as in science and technology. They have built the originally backward Russia into a great socialist country with the latest technology, large-scale mechanized collective agriculture, and the most advanced science and culture.
    The Chinese people are advancing along the road illuminated by the light of the October Revolution. The brilliant achievements made by the Soviet people in socialist and communist construction are the example for the Chinese people. In the revolution and socialist construction, the Chinese people have always regarded the Soviet experience as the best learning material, which has given great help to the Chinese revolution and socialist construction. When celebrating the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Chinese people feel infinitely close to the Soviet people and express their lofty respect to the Soviet people at the same time.
    In our socialist construction cause, the Soviet people have given us comprehensive, huge, and fraternal assistance. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the Soviet Communist Party.
    Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live the great and unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!
    Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live the great unity of all peace-loving countries and people in the world!
    Long live world peace!
