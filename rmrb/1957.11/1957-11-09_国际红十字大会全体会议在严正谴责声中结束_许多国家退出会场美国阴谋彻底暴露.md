Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 8th: This reporter reports: The International Red Cross Conference plenary session ended on the evening of the 7th amidst an atmosphere of strong condemnation due to the political conspiracy of the American delegation to create "two Chinas," and the conference was thus split.

    The passage of the American proposal caused the delegations of many countries to withdraw from the meeting in protest against this action.

    The conference, which opened on October 28th, had done much useful work in a spirit of unity and mutual understanding for ten days, adopting rules on the protection of civilians in wartime and resolutions against nuclear weapons, but was sabotaged by the American delegation at the last moment.

    The American delegation had earlier threatened that if their proposal aimed at allowing Chiang Kai-shek clique elements to participate in the meeting was not passed, they would withdraw from the meeting. Before the start of the secret ballot, the head of the US government delegation, Mr. McClintock, asked the chairman, Ms. Kaur, to announce the names of those requesting a secret ballot, saying: "The American delegation is very interested in the names of these people." Kaur resolutely rejected this shameless request. When the delegates were writing their ballots, members of the American delegation were active near the seats of other delegations.

    The results of the vote showed that although 62 votes supported the American proposal, another 60 votes did not support it, of which 44 votes clearly expressed opposition and 16 votes abstained.

    After the voting results were announced, Pan Zili, the head of the Chinese government delegation, stepped onto the podium amidst a silence of anticipation. In a short and forceful speech, he stated: "The Chinese delegation believes that the American proposal just passed by this conference violates the International Red Cross Charter. It was passed under the manipulation of the United States, and therefore it is illegal and invalid. The delegation of the government of the People's Republic of China and the delegation of Chinese Red Cross Society strongly protest against the United States for carrying out this despicable activity of creating 'two Chinas' at this solemn humanitarian international conference, and declare that we withdraw from the 19th International Red Cross Conference."

    At this time, representatives of many Asian, African, and socialist countries stood up to bid a solemn farewell to the delegations of the Chinese government and the Red Cross Society.

    Subsequently, Ms. Kaur immediately announced the withdrawal of the Indian Red Cross Society delegation, the host of the conference. She said: The passage of the American proposal "is a serious discourtesy to the Indian Red Cross Society."

    Ms. Kaur exposed the American trick. She told the conference that the 1952 International Red Cross Conference was originally scheduled to be held in the United States. However, the decision had to be cancelled at the last minute because the United States refused to allow the delegation of the People's Republic of China to go there. Later, the conference was moved to Toronto. She said: "If I had a similar opportunity, this conference would not have been held here." Then Ms. Kaur resigned from her position as chair of the conference. She exited the venue amidst cheers, accompanied by the delegation of the Indian Red Cross Society.

    The head of the Soviet delegation, Mr. Miterev, requested that since the delegation of the host country had withdrawn from the conference, the conference should be adjourned immediately. However, the conference did not accept this request.

    Miterev then took the podium again and announced the withdrawal of the government and Red Cross Society delegations of the Soviet Union, Belarus, and Ukraine. He pointed out: "The majority of delegates supported a politically motivated proposal." He said: "The American delegation should bear the responsibility for the breakdown of this conference."

    The heads of the delegations of Poland, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also took the podium to speak. They sternly condemned the American conspiracy and expressed sympathy to the delegation of the host country. They announced the withdrawal of their delegations from the conference in protest. The Indonesian and Syrian delegations also withdrew from the conference in protest, demonstrating the mutual support and solidarity of Asian and African countries.

    So many countries, so many delegations withdrew from the conference to protest the ugly conspiracy of the American delegation, which is a first in the history of the Red Cross. The banner of unity of the Red Cross was torn apart solely because of American political motives.

    At this time, two representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique who were waiting outside were led into the conference hall by American representatives. These two people entered the venue and took their seats like thieves.

    Karmarkar, the head of the Indian government delegation, solemnly protested that these two Chiang Kai-shek clique elements had no right to attend the meeting without presenting their credentials, and he requested the conference to rule that their attendance at the meeting was not in accordance with the rules of procedure. However, the remainder of the conference, under American manipulation, rejected his question about the rules of procedure. India and Egypt voted against it, and 18 votes, including the United Kingdom, abstained. The Egyptian delegation then withdrew from the meeting in protest. Representatives of many other countries also withdrew from the meeting.

    Karmarkar stated that the position of the Indian government delegation was to "fight to the end for matters of principle within the conference." He said: "We express full sympathy to the Indian Red Cross Society and other delegations that have withdrawn from the meeting." He pointed out that no country can recognize "two Chinas."

    Even such clear condemnation and opposition could not stop McClintock, the head of the US government delegation, from shamelessly taking the podium and saying: "The conference does not need to feel ashamed of its actions."

    Later, the remaining delegates passed a resolution on "The Red Cross as a Factor in Promoting World Peace." It was during the discussion of this resolution that the meeting was interrupted to vote on the American proposal. Some delegates sarcastically said that after such an indecent battle, it would be ridiculous to talk about peace now.

    Pan Zili, the head of the Chinese government delegation, held a press conference after withdrawing from the meeting. He explained the firm position of the People's Republic of China against the American conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

    The conference had earlier decided that the next International Red Cross Conference would be held in Geneva in 1963. The conference also adopted some resolutions put forward by the International Humanitarian Law, Social Medical Affairs, and General Affairs Committees.

### 国际红十字大会全体会议在严正谴责声中结束  许多国家退出会场美国阴谋彻底暴露

    国际红十字大会全体会议在严正谴责声中结束
    许多国家退出会场美国阴谋彻底暴露
    新华社新德里8日电　本社记者报道：国际红十字大会全体会议7日晚由于美国代表团制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋而在严正谴责的气氛中结束，会议并且因此陷于分裂。
    美国提案的通过使许多国家的代表团退出会议，对这个行动表示抗议。
    会议从10月28日开幕十天以来，已经以团结和互相谅解的精神作了许多有益的工作，通过了关于战时保护平民的规则和关于反对核武器的决议，但是在最后时刻遭到美国代表团的破坏。
    美国代表团早些时曾威胁说，如果他们的目的在于让蒋介石集团分子参加会议的提案不被通过，他们将退出会议。在开始秘密投票之前，美国政府代表团团长麦克林托克曾要求主席考尔女士宣布要求举行秘密投票的人们的姓名，并且说：“美国代表团对这些人的姓名很感兴趣。”考尔坚决拒绝了这个无耻的要求。当代表们在写票的时候，美国代表团的人员曾在别国代表团的席位附近活动。
    表决结果显示，虽然有六十二票支持美国的提案，但是另外有六十票没有支持它，其中有四十四票明白表示反对，而有十六票弃权。
    在表决结果宣布后，中国政府代表团团长潘自力在寂静的期待中登上了讲坛。他在简短有力的发言中声明：“中国代表团认为，这个会议刚才所通过的美国提案是违反国际红十字章程的。它是在美国的操纵下通过的，因此它是非法的、无效的。中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团强烈抗议美国在这个庄严的人道主义的国际会议上进行这种制造‘两个中国’的卑鄙活动，并且宣布，我们退出第十九届国际红十字大会。”
    这时，许多亚非国家和社会主义国家的代表起立向中国政府和红十字会代表团表示庄严的告别。
    随后，考尔女士立即宣布大会东道主印度红十字会代表团退出会议。她说：通过了美国提案“对印度红十字会是严重的失礼行为”。
    考尔女士揭露了美国的把戏。她告诉大会说，1952年的国际红十字大会原定在美国举行。可是在最后关头不得不取消这个决定，因为美国拒绝允许中华人民共和国的代表团到那里去。后来大会改在多伦多举行。她说：“如果我有类似的机会的话，这次大会本来不会在这里举行的。”于是考尔女士辞去了会议主席的职务。她在一片欢呼声中，在印度红十字会代表团陪同下退出了会场。
    苏联代表团团长米捷列夫要求，由于东道国家的代表团退出了会议，会议应该立即结束。可是，大会没有接受这个要求。
    米捷列夫又走上讲台，宣布苏联、白俄罗斯和乌克兰的政府和红十字会代表团退出会场。他指出：“大部分代表支持了有政治动机的提案”。他说：“这次大会破裂的责任应该由美国代表团担负。”
    波兰、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫和越南民主共和国等国的代表团团长都登上讲台讲话。他们严正地谴责美国的阴谋，并且对东道国家的代表团表示同情。他们宣布自己的代表团退出会议以示抗议。印度尼西亚代表团和叙利亚代表团也退出会议表示抗议，从而表明了亚非国家的相互支持和团结。
    这么多的国家，这么多的代表团为了抗议美国代表团的丑恶阴谋而退出了会议，这在红十字会的历史上还是第一次。仅仅是由于美国的政治动机，红十字会的团结的旗帜就被撕毁了。
    这个时候，在外面等待的两个蒋介石集团的代表被美国代表引进了会议厅。这两个人像小偷似地进入会场就座。
    印度政府代表团团长卡马卡尔郑重抗议说，这两个蒋介石集团分子在没有交验资格证明书的情况下没有权利出席这里的会议，他并且要求大会裁决他们出席会议是不合议事规则的。但是，大会剩下来的部分在美国操纵下否决了他的有关议事规则的质问。印度和埃及投票反对，包括联合王国在内的十八票弃权。埃及代表团接着退出会场表示抗议。其他许多国家的代表也退出了会场。
    卡马卡尔表明印度政府代表团的立场是要“在会议内为原则问题斗争到底”。他说：“我们对已经退出会场的印度红十字会和其他代表团表示充分的同情。”他指出，任何国家都不能承认“两个中国”。
    即使是如此明白的谴责和反对也制止不了美国政府代表团团长麦克林托克厚颜无耻地走上讲台说：“会议不必为自己的行动感到羞耻。”
    后来，其余的代表通过了关于“红十字会是拥护世界和平的一个因素”的决议。就是在讨论这个决议时，会议中途被打断就美国提案进行表决。有些代表讽刺地说，在进行了如此不体面的战斗以后，现在再要谈什么和平的话未免滑稽。
    中国政府代表团团长潘自力在退出会议后举行了记者招待会。他说明了中华人民共和国反对美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋的坚定立场。
    大会在早些时候决定下一届国际红十字大会将于1963年在日内瓦举行。大会还通过了国际人道主义法律、社会医务、总务委员会所提出的一些决议。
