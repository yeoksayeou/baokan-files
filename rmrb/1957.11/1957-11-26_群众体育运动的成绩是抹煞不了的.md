The sports world is also a position that bourgeois rightists want to seize in their attack on the Party and socialism. The aim of the rightists in the sports world is to usurp the Party's leadership over sports and negate the socialist direction of sports, pulling New China's sports movement onto the capitalist road.

The rightists in the sports world chose competition work as the focus of their attack with ulterior motives.

They said that the State Sports Commission only emphasizes competition and neglects mass sports, which violates the guiding principles of sports. This is to fundamentally negate the achievements of all our work and the labor of sports workers across the country over the years. Some rightists even said that we use capitalist methods to run sports, instead putting that label on us first. It's as if they are the authentic socialists, and only they care about people's health and mass sports. In fact, this paper mask is easily punctured. They neither go to factories or the countryside, nor do they see the fundamental changes in school sports, and they especially do not mention a word about their own experiences before liberation. They neither face the current facts nor deliberately avoid the past truth, leaving only nonsense.

From the very beginning, New China's sports movement adopted a mass-based approach, starting from enhancing people's physique and promoting people's health, serving production and national defense. This is determined by the socialist nature of our sports cause. We regard sports as a kind of cultural life for the masses and a means of socialist education. Since liberation, the State Sports Commission has consistently stipulated that carrying out mass sports activities is the basic principle of work, and has taken various measures based on the progress of the work to promote mass sports activities, making them regular and gradually forming a system. For example, the promotion of broadcast gymnastics, according to a 1956 survey, involved one million workers in more than six thousand factories and mines alone, with good results. Foreign friends who visited China also saw the prosperity of the Chinese people from this; from the partial trial implementation of physical exercise standards, to the separate promotion of the Labor and Defense System Preliminary Grade in various places, and then to the nationwide promotion of a unified Labor and National Defense Sports System, which was warmly welcomed by the majority of young people, with more than 3.29 million people participating in exercise by the end of 1956, and more than 760,000 people passing the test; sports activists from various industries and systems organized their own sports associations in order to ensure their sports activities. At present, 21 systems across the country have established national councils of sports associations, leading more than 38,000 grassroots sports associations, with a total of more than 4.7 million members, mainly distributed among the broad masses of workers and staff, uniting more people to participate in various sports activities; in order to prepare cadres for the development of sports across the country, the state has opened various sports schools and training courses. In six sports colleges, 16 physical education departments of normal colleges, 11 secondary sports schools, and five secondary sports specialty classes, more than 5,000 people have graduated since liberation, and there are currently more than 10,000 people in school, which is more than the number of people in school in the thirty years before liberation; the establishment of youth and children's amateur sports schools is to cultivate reserve forces for athletes by using students' spare time. By the end of 1956, 76 schools had been established, with 8,750 people participating in the study, and will continue to develop to factories and mines in the future; the trial implementation of the national competition system, athlete grading system, and referee grading system is to carry out various sports activities in grassroots units through competition, so that mass sports activities can be consolidated, and the popularization and improvement can be linked together. According to a 1956 survey of more than 6,000 factories and mines, more than 33,000 various sports meets were held in one year, and more than 700,000 workers and staff participated in basketball, volleyball, and football alone. Aren't the above the results of implementing the policy of carrying out mass sports activities over the years?

We naturally also want to improve. We are improving on a broad mass base, and in turn, promoting and guiding the progress of mass sports. Unlike the rightists, who obliterate everything by singing high-sounding tunes. After several years of work since liberation, China's sports movement has a certain foundation. In order to meet the requirements of the broad masses in the socialist upsurge, the State Sports Commission proposed in 1956 that, on the basis of continuing to carry out mass sports activities, we should strive to improve sports technology, and strive to approach or catch up with international levels in some projects within a few years.

There is no need to list one by one the increasing number of new records created by Chinese athletes and the increasingly better results achieved in international competitions. China's vast number of sports workers and young outstanding athletes have initially reached the requirements put forward by the people, enabling China to begin to enter the world's advanced ranks amid the amazement of people in the international sports community. This is precisely because we have a strong mass base, and new forces are constantly emerging, continuously supplementing the original athlete team. At present, according to very incomplete statistics, there are more than 40,000 male and female athletes with grade titles in China, including 117 sports masters. Continuous improvement in technology encourages them to move forward, and at the same time attracts more viewers, who get demonstration and guidance from it, and then actually participate in exercise.

Competition and improving sports technology should never be completely regarded as the same thing. Competition is only an important means of improving sports technology, and it is also an important means of promoting mass sports. Whether it is popularization or improvement, a lot of work must be done, and a very important and critical part of the work is to organize competitions. Competition is a prominent feature of sports, and it can be said to be an attribute of sports. The principle is very simple: any ordinary team, if it does not compete frequently, will be difficult to improve, and in the end, this team will inevitably not be able to consolidate. Therefore, sports associations or sports colleges, sports commissions or sports federations, should regard the work of organizing competitions as one of their important businesses. Even sports scientific research work should not be separated from the athletes on the field. Because competition is the summary of peacetime exercise and training, there will be no progress without competition, and the more competitions, the faster the progress. Before liberation, from 1910 to 1948, in thirty-eight years, China only held seven national games, with only seven events, and less than 10,000 athletes participating. Since liberation, 122 national comprehensive and individual sports meets have been held, with the number of events increased to 27, and more than 33,000 athletes participating. Provincial and municipal sports meets alone involved 1.8 million people in 1956. Yang Xiuqiong, the "Mermaid" who was heavily promoted by the Kuomintang in those years, had a performance that was only at the level of today's second-level athletes. However, if we compare the number of national competitions we hold each year and the number of international competitions we participate in with the Soviet Union or other European countries, then the difference is too great. They have no less than one hundred and dozens of international competitions a year, and as many as four or five hundred; in some important cities, there are almost several competitions every day. Therefore, they absorb new technological achievements quickly, accumulate more competition experience, and each athlete is "battle-hardened," so they are naturally easy to mature and become experienced. As for the phenomenon of excessive missed work and missed classes by athletes in our competitions, it is mainly because our competition system is not yet perfect, and there are still shortcomings in the organization work, which should be continuously improved, and cannot be blamed on the competition itself.

Our competitions are widespread at the grassroots level, and are by no means limited to a few national team members, as the rightists say. We are not competing for the sake of competition. The rightists say that the State Sports Commission is the root of championism, which is completely slander. We organize competitions in order to learn from each other, exchange experiences, improve technology, and promote the development of mass sports. During each sports meet, we organize several technical seminars or experience exchange meetings. We also organize special personnel to study international competitions and promote friendship with each other, and not simply for victory or defeat. Therefore, we use communist ideology to educate our athletes, establish good sportsmanship, and resolutely oppose any manifestation of bourgeois individualism, championism, and nationalism.

The rightists also say that we are laymen, especially attacking Party leading cadres. This is the same weapon used by rightists in other places to oppose the leadership of the Party. Are they really experts? In fact, what they have suffered is the authentic bourgeois education of "developed limbs, simple mind," and they do not have much real talent. In the past, in physical education classes in schools, the most popular was the "free-range" style, and no amount of reasoning could be done. They accepted the mantle from foreign masters such as the United States of the gold dollar empire, and Germany and Japan of militarism, which is nothing more than "above politics," regarding sports as the same thing as gambling and playing with women, regarding athletes as commodities, or like a dog or a horse; or seeing in sports the human "love of killing," used to cultivate militarist ideas.

In short, we adhere to the Party's leadership over the sports cause, resolutely defend the socialist direction of the sports cause, and adhere to learning from the Soviet Union and learning the strengths of all countries. The shortcomings in our work must be improved, and we are still very backward and should not be proud. However, the facts cannot be denied, and Chinese sports workers have strong confidence in their future.

    群众体育运动的成绩是抹煞不了的	张非垢
    体育界也是资产阶级右派向党向社会主义进攻中所要夺取的一个阵地。体育界的右派分子的目的，是要篡夺党对体育事业的领导和否定体育事业的社会主义方向，把新中国的体育运动拉转到资本主义的道路上去。
      体育界的右派分子选定竞赛工作作为进攻的重点，是用了心机的。
      他们说，国家体委只重竞赛，忽视群众体育，是违背了体育运动的方针。这是为了便于从根本上否定我们一切工作的成绩和全国体育工作者数年的劳动。有的右派分子甚至说我们是用资本主义的办法来办体育，反倒先把他们这顶帽子扣在我们头上了。好像他们才是道地的社会主义者，只有他们才关心人民健康和群众体育。其实，这种纸糊的面具一戳就破。他们既不去工厂、农村，对学校体育的根本变化也视而不见，特别对他们自己在解放以前的亲身经历更是一字不提。既不正视当前的事实，又故意规避过去的真象，剩下的只有胡说八道。
    新中国的体育运动一开始就采取群众性的方针，从增强人民体质和促进人民健康出发，为生产和国防服务。这是我国体育事业的社会主义性质所决定的。我们把体育看作人民群众的一种文化生活和社会主义教育的一种手段。解放以来，国家体委一直是把开展群众性的体育运动规定为工作的基本方针，并且根据工作的进展，采取了各项措施，以推动群众体育活动，使之经常化，逐渐形成制度。比如，推行广播体操，据1956年调查，只是在六千多个厂矿里，就有一百万职工参加，效果良好，来华访问的外国朋友也从中看到中国人民的兴旺之气；由局部试行体育锻炼标准，至各地分别推行劳卫制预备级，再到全国推广统一的劳动卫国体育制度，受到广大青年的热烈欢迎，至1956年底参加锻炼的已达三百二十九万人以上，已经测验及格的有七十六万多人；各产业、各系统的体育积极分子自己组织了体育协会，是为了使自己的体育活动得到保证，目前全国二十一个系统建立了体育协会全国理事会，领导着三万八千多个基层体育协会，共有会员四百七十多万人，主要分布在广大职工群众中，他们团结了更多的人参加各种体育活动；为了给全国体育运动的发展准备干部，国家开办了各种体育学校和训练班，在六所体育学院、十六个师范学院体育系科、十一所中等体育学校和五个中等体育专业班里，解放以来已经毕业五千人以上，目前在校人数一万多人，比起解放以前三十年间在校人数还多；举办青年和少年业余体育学校，为的是利用学生的课余时间，培养运动员后备力量，到1956年底已办七十六所，有八千七百五十人参加学习，今后还要向厂矿发展；试行全国竞赛制度、运动员等级制度和裁判员等级制度，是为了通过竞赛，在基层单位开展多种多样的体育活动，使群众体育活动巩固起来，使普及和提高衔接起来，1956年所调查的六千多个厂矿，一年中举行各种运动会三万三千多次，仅参加篮、排、足球运动的职工就有七十多万人。以上种种，不正是历年贯彻执行开展群众性体育运动的方针的结果吗？
      我们自然也要提高。我们是在广泛的群众基础上提高，并转而推动和指导群众体育运动的前进。不像右派分子那样，借唱高调而抹杀一切。在经过解放以来几年工作之后，我国体育运动有了一定的基础，为了适应社会主义高潮中广大群众的要求，国家体委才在1956年提出：在继续开展群众体育运动的基础上，努力提高运动技术，并且争取数年内在若干项目上接近或赶上国际水平。
      用不着一一列举我国运动员所创造的越来越多的新纪录和在国际比赛中所获得的越来越好的成绩，我国广大的体育工作者和年轻的优秀运动员已经初步达到了人民所提出的要求，使我国在国际体育界人士的惊叹声中开始进入世界先进行列。这正是因为我们有了雄厚的群众基础，新生力量不断涌现出来，源源补充原有的运动员队伍。目前，据很不完全的统计，我国已有等级称号的男女运动员四万多人，其中有运动健将一百一十七人。技术不断提高鼓舞着他们不断前进，同时吸引更多的观众，从中得到示范和指导，进而实际参加锻炼。
    决不应当把竞赛和提高运动技术完全看作一回事。竞赛只是提高运动技术的一个重要手段，同时也是推动群众体育的一个重要手段。无论是普及，或者是提高，都要进行很多工作，其中很重要的带有关键性的一部分工作，就是组织竞赛。竞赛是体育运动一个突出的特点，可以说是体育运动的一个属性。道理很简单，任何一个普通的球队，如果不经常比赛，就很难有进步，最后这个球队也必然巩固不住。所以，体育协会或者体育院校、体委或者体总，都应当把组织竞赛的工作看作本身的重要业务之一。就是体育科学研究工作也不应当脱离场地上的运动员。因为竞赛是平时锻炼和训练工作的总结，没有比赛就不会进步，比赛越多，进步也越快。解放以前，从1910年到1948年的三十八年间，中国仅仅举行过七次全国运动会，项目不过七项，参加的运动员不到一万人。解放以来，全国综合的和单项的运动会已经举行过一百二十二次，项目增至二十七项，参加的运动员三万三千多人。省市的运动会仅1956年就有一百八十万人参加。当年国民党大肆吹擂的“美人鱼”杨秀琼，成绩不过是今天二级运动员的水平。不过，如果拿我们现在每年举行全国比赛和参加国际比赛的次数同苏联或其他欧洲的国家相比，则又相差太多了。他们一年的国际比赛，少则百数十次，多则四五百次；在一些重要城市里，几乎每天都有几场比赛。所以他们吸收新的技术成就快，积累比赛经验多，每个运动员“身经百战”，自然容易成熟和老练。至于我国竞赛中发生运动员误工误课过多的现象，主要是因为我们的竞赛制度还不完善，组织工作还有缺点，应当不断加以改进，不能归咎于竞赛本身。
    我们的竞赛普遍于基层，决不像右派分子所说的那样，只限于少数国家队员。我们不是为竞赛而竞赛，右派分子说国家体委是锦标主义的根源，完全是诬蔑。我们组织比赛，是为了互相学习，交流经验，提高技术，推动群众体育运动的开展。我们在每次运动会期间都组织若干技术座谈会或经验交流会，国际比赛也组织专人学习，并且促进相互间的友好，并非单纯为了胜负。所以，我们用共产主义思想教育自己的运动员，树立良好的体育道德，坚决反对资产阶级的个人主义、锦标主义和民族主义的任何表现。
    右派分子又说我们是外行，特别攻击党员领导干部。这和其他地方的右派分子反对党的领导所使用的武器是一样的。难道他们果真是内行吗？其实他们所身受的正是道地的资产阶级那一套“四肢发达，头脑简单”的教育，并无多少真才实学。过去学校里上体育课，最流行的是“放羊式”，根本讲不出多少道理来。他们从金元帝国的美国、军国主义的德国和日本等外国祖师接受的衣钵，不外是“超政治”，把体育运动看作和赌博、玩女人是一回事，把运动员看作商品，或者如同一条狗、一匹马；或者从体育中看到人类“嗜杀成性”，用来培植军国主义思想。
    总之，我们坚持党对体育事业的领导，坚决保卫体育事业的社会主义方向，坚持向苏联学习和学习一切国家的长处。我们工作中的缺点必须改进，我们还很落后，不可骄傲。但是，事实是抹煞不了的，中国体育工作者对自己的前途有坚强的信心。
