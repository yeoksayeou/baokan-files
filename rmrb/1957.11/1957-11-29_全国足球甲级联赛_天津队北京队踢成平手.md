    National Football League A

    Tianjin Team and Beijing Team Draw

    (Our Dispatch) In the second round of the National Football League A competition in the Beijing competition area, a match was held on November 28th. The Tianjin team drew with the Beijing team with a score of 1-1.

    After the kickoff, the Beijing team attacked first. Just four minutes into the game, they had a corner kick opportunity. Left-winger Wang Lu lobbed the ball high in front of the goal, but it was cleared by Tianjin's Zhang Shuihao with a volley. In less than a minute, they regrouped and attacked again. Right-winger Chen Jialiang dribbled the ball straight to the goal line, suddenly turned and lobbed the ball high. The ball landed right in front of the goal, about twelve meters to the right. Wang Lu rushed to kick, but due to panic, he didn't kick it accurately, and the ball only rolled forward about two meters before stopping. Finally, it was kicked into the midfield by the opposing defender. Facing a strong opponent, the Tianjin team was not to be outdone. They also launched fierce attacks. Forwards Sun Yuanyun, Jin Changji, Zhang Shuihao, and others all pressed into the opponent's penalty area for powerful shots, but because their shooting accuracy was poor and the opponent's defense was tight, the ball was either blocked or went out of bounds. The fierce battle went back and forth for more than forty minutes, and neither side could score a goal. Only two minutes before the end of the first half, Tianjin's left-winger Sun Yuanyun took a throw-in. He threw the ball to right-winger Liu Yinpei, who had run to the left side. Liu Yinpei lobbed the ball into the goal area before it hit the ground. Center forward Jin Changji, with quick eyes and feet, jumped up and headed the ball into the net. The first half ended with a score of 1-0.

    In the second half, in order to reverse the defeat, the Beijing team changed their style of play from the first half, switching from wing attacks to central attacks, and replaced Wang Lu with Sun Fucheng, who was good at long-range shots, to increase their offensive power. Sure enough, the situation gradually changed. Beijing's left-winger Cong Zheyu lobbed a ball from the left side near the midfield towards the opponent's goal. Sun Fucheng rushed in and kicked the ball into the back of the net. The Beijing team pulled back a goal, and after the score became 1-1, the situation suddenly became tense. Both sides ran more actively and tackled more fiercely, each wanting to score another goal to win the final victory. However, the 1-1 stalemate continued until the end of the game.

    The Tianjin team had the most points in the first round, with seven wins, one loss, and one draw in nine games. In the second round, they have not lost yet. If they can defeat the "August 1st" team on December 1st, they will have hope of winning the championship. (Shi Yuzhong)

    全国足球甲级联赛
    天津队北京队踢成平手
    本报讯　全国足球甲级队联赛第二循环北京竞赛区，11月28日举行了一场比赛。天津队以一比一踢平北京队。
    开球后北京队先行进攻，刚四分钟他们就获得发角球机会，左翼王陆将球高吊门前，却被天津队张水浩凌空击出。不到一分钟他们又卷土重来，右锋陈家亮带球直达底线，突然转身高吊，球正好落在大门右前方约十二公尺处，王陆赶上猛踢，可是由于慌张没有踢准，球只向前滚了约两公尺远就停下了，最后还是被对方后卫踢到中场。强敌当前，天津队也不示弱，他们同样地发动了猛烈的进攻，前锋孙元云、金昌吉、张水浩等都曾迫到对方禁区进行劲射，但是由于射门脚头欠准和对方防守严密，球不是被挡回就是越出界外。一来一往的激战，一直持续了四十多分钟，双方都不能踢进一球。上半场最后只有二分钟时，天津队左翼孙元云发界外球，他将球掷给已跑到左路的右翼刘荫培，刘荫培不待球落地就高吊球门区，中锋金昌吉眼明脚快跳起用头将球顶入网内。上半场以一比○结束。
    下半场北京队为了挽回败局，他们改变了上半场的打法，把侧翼打门改为中路打门，并且以善于远射的孙福成替下王陆，以增强他们的进攻威力。果然局势渐有改变，北京队左翼丛者余在靠近中场的左边，向对方门前高吊一球，孙福成赶至，把球踢飞网底。北京队扳回一球，比分形成一比一后，情势顿时紧张起来，双方跑动更为积极，抢球更为剧烈，谁都想再攻入一球，以获最后的胜利。可是一比一的局面一直维持到终场。
    天津队在第一循环中积分最多，九场战斗七胜一败一和。在第二循环中，他们一直没败过，如果12月1日他们能够战胜“八一”队的话，将有获得冠军的希望。　（施毓忠）
