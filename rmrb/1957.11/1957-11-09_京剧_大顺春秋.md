Peking Opera "The Great Shun Dynasty"

　　The Peking Opera "The Great Shun Dynasty," performed by the Fourth Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theater, was originally titled "Forty Days in Beijing." It narrates a historical story of the failure of the revolution led by Li Zicheng's peasant uprising army after their victorious entry into the city due to pride and complacency. The play focuses on portraying two different types of characters under Li Zicheng - Li Yan and Liu Zongmin. One is cautious and careful after entering the city, always prioritizing the revolutionary cause, and maintaining his original hardworking style; the other is overwhelmed by victory, indulging in pleasure and becoming corrupt, causing a very bad influence among the masses. Li Mingsheng and Guo Yuanfen, who played these two roles, appropriately portrayed the inner emotions of the characters, and their performances were quite successful. This play was a creation of the Pingju Theater of the Joint Defense Command of the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Shanxi, and Suiyuan before liberation. It was performed in Yan'an and had a great educational effect on the audience at that time.

　　The Fourth Troupe was formerly the Peking Opera Troupe of the General Political Department's Cultural Troupe and the Peking Opera Theater of the Political Department of the Southwest Military Region. They are both performing groups with a long and glorious revolutionary tradition of serving the soldiers. Currently, the Fourth Troupe has 120 members, most of whom are young, with Party and League members accounting for more than 60%. Under the long-term education of the Party, the actors have cultivated a strong sense of collectivism and treat performances with a very serious attitude. (Weng)

    京剧“大顺春秋”
    中国京剧院四团演出的“大顺春秋”，原名“北京四十天”，它叙述了明末李自成领导的农民起义军胜利进城后，因骄傲自满而使革命失败的一段历史故事。剧中着重刻划了李自成部下二个不同类型的人物——李岩和刘宗敏，一个进城后谨慎小心、处处以革命事业为重，保持了原来的艰苦作风；一个却被胜利冲昏头脑，享乐腐化，蜕化变质，在群众中造成极坏的影响。扮演这二个角色的李鸣盛和郭元汾都恰当地刻划出了人物的内心情感，演出相当成功。这出戏是解放前陕、甘、宁、晋、绥五省联防司令部评剧院的创作剧目，曾在延安上演过，当时对观众曾起了很大的教育作用。
    四团的前身是总政文工团京剧团和西南军区政治部京剧院，它们都是有着长期为兵服务的光荣革命传统的演出队伍。目前，四团的成员有一百二十人，大都很年轻，党团员占60％以上。在党的长期教育下，演员们都培养起强烈的整体观念，并以十分严肃的态度对待演出。　（翁）
