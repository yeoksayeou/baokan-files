This Dispatch from Jinan, November 2nd: Under the circumstances of a prolonged drought this autumn, where the sowing area did not reach the original plan, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of wheat next year and creating 20 million mu of high-yield wheat fields with a yield of over 200 jin per mu is one of the important contents of the high tide of agricultural production in Shandong this winter and next spring. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have also issued a decision on striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of wheat next year and creating 20 million mu of high-yield wheat fields.

Shandong Province's wheat production plan for next year is 7 billion jin. This year, the province encountered a drought unseen in decades, with many areas not receiving rain for fifty or sixty days. However, under the leadership of the Party, the province's peasants have overcome the drought and seized the agricultural season. As of the end of October, the province had sown over 55 million mu of wheat (the original plan was to sow 63 million mu of wheat). However, due to the impact of the drought and the low quality of sowing during the rush to plant, there are still instances of missing seedlings and broken rows in the sown areas. In order to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of wheat next year, the Provincial Party Committee has proposed three main measures:
  (1) Strengthen the management of the existing 55 million mu of wheat fields and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of wheat. Use the method of accounting and comparison to mobilize the masses to vigorously replant seedlings, carry out timely topdressing, trampling, watering, and moisture conservation, and do everything possible to ensure that all seedlings are complete and thriving.
  (2) Launch a "Five Waters and Three Fertilizers" movement to create 20 million mu of high-yield fields, so that the yield per mu reaches more than 200 jin, and the total output is equal to the harvest of 40 million mu of ordinary wheat fields. According to the investigation and research of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Department of Water Resources, there are currently many favorable conditions for completing this task. The experience of the past two or three years has proven that water-irrigated wheat with better field management has yielded more than 200 jin per mu, and many cooperatives have created good experiences in high-yield wheat production, especially after the majority of farmers have undergone socialist education, their production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high.
  (3) Try to replant the 6 million mu of wheat fields that have not been sown with winter crops suitable for winter planting, such as barley, peas, and potatoes.

Striving for an all-round increase in wheat production next year is of great significance for completing and over fulfilling the province's grain production increase plan for next year. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee calls on everyone to show the socialist spirit of fighting drought and planting wheat and strive to make the total wheat output of the province exceed 7 billion jin next year.

### 播种面积因天旱缩小　用人力争取粮食丰收  山东要创造两千万亩小麦丰产田

    播种面积因天旱缩小　用人力争取粮食丰收
    山东要创造两千万亩小麦丰产田
    本报济南2日电　在今秋长期干旱，播种面积没有达到原定计划的情况下，力争明年小麦全面丰收并创造两千万亩小麦亩产二百斤以上的丰产田，这是山东今冬明春农业生产高潮中的重要内容之一。省委和省人民委员会也发布了关于力争明年小麦全面丰收和创造两千万亩小麦丰产田的决定。
    山东省明年小麦的产量计划是七十亿斤。今年全省遇到了几十年未有的旱象，许多地区都是五、六十天没有落雨。但全省农民在党的领导下，已经战胜了干旱，夺取了农时。截至10月底，全省已播种小麦五千五百余万亩（原计划种麦六千三百万亩）。但由于干旱影响，以及抢种时质量不高，已播种的仍有缺苗断垄现象，为了争取明年小麦全面丰收，省委提出了三项主要措施：
  （1）加强现有五千五百余万亩麦田管理，争取小麦全面丰收。以算账对比的方法，动员群众大力补苗，及时进行追肥、踏压、浇水、保墒，想尽一切办法做到苗全苗旺。
  （2）开展“五水三肥”运动，创造两千万亩高额丰产田，使每亩产量达到二百斤以上，其总产量等于四千万亩一般麦田的收成。根据省农业厅和水利厅的调查研究，完成这一任务目前有着很多有利条件。过去两、三年的经验证明，凡是麦田管理较好的水浇小麦，亩产都在二百斤以上，而且不少合作社已创造了小麦高额丰产的好经验，特别是广大农民经过社会主义教育后，生产热情空前高涨。（3）把未能播种的六百万亩麦田，尽力补种大麦、豌豆、马铃薯等适于冬种的作物。
    争取明年小麦全面增产，对完成和超额完成明年全省粮食增产计划，具有重大的意义。因此省委号召：拿出抗旱种麦的社会主义劲头，为争取明年全省小麦总产量超过七十亿斤而奋斗。
