    Kazakhstan, within the great multi-ethnic family of the Soviet Union, can be described as a precious pearl. However, before the October Revolution, it remained buried underground. Only the Soviet regime unearthed it and, illuminated by Lenin's national policy, allowed it to shine brilliantly.
    Before 1917, Kazakhstan was a desolate place. Its immensely rich underground resources were virtually untouched. The people lived a nomadic life, the patriarchal system held sway, and it was very backward in terms of culture and economy. In the forty years since the October Revolution, the Kazakh people have made a leap forward—having broken free from the shackles of feudalism, they have taken a giant step into the new socialist era.
    Today, Kazakhstan is a scene of vibrant construction. Since the Central Committee of the CPSU called for the opening of virgin lands in 1953, a large number of laborers have come here. In just over three years, they have transformed twenty million hectares of wasteland into fertile fields and established more than 530 large-scale state farms. Areas that were once sparsely populated are now covered with green fields. In 1956 alone, the Kazakh Republic delivered one billion poods of grain to the state, exceeding the total of the previous eleven years. The vast and beautiful pastures of the Altai and Tian Shan mountains have provided a broad space for the development of animal husbandry. Kazakhstan, second only to the Russian Federal Republic in size, is a sparsely populated area. Its area is almost five times that of Ukraine, but its population is only one-fifth of Ukraine's. Before the revolution, people lived a nomadic, impoverished, and ignorant life on barren land. Only the socialist transformation of agriculture and technological transformation led by the Communist Party have collectivized and settled all the nomadic households in Kazakhstan. Subsequently, its situation has undergone tremendous changes. For example, Kazakhstan had almost no industry in the past. During the Soviet era, however, more than three thousand modern industrial enterprises have emerged in Kazakhstan. Underground mineral deposits have been successively discovered and exploited. Kazakhstan has the world's richest deposits of chromium and vanadium. Its reserves of copper, lead, silver, and nickel rank first in the Soviet Union, while its reserves of coal, oil, and manganese rank second. The copper produced in Balkhash and Jezkazgan, and the lead produced in Chimkent and Leninogorsk, are well-known throughout the Soviet Union. Karaganda has long become the third largest coal mining base in the Soviet Union, second only to Donbas and Kuzbas. Kostanay Oblast and Karaganda will become the center of ferrous metallurgy, because they have both abundant iron and cheap coal available. The prospects for development are unlimited. Therefore, people say that in Kostanay Oblast of Kazakhstan, the second Urals of the Soviet Union is now being built.
    Before the revolution, the Kazakhs lived in tents and used oil lamps. In 1913, the total power generation in Kazakhstan was only 1.3 million kilowatt-hours, while in 1956 it rose to 7 billion kilowatt-hours! Not long ago, the Shulginsk Hydroelectric Station was built on the Irtysh River. In the next few years, eleven more power stations of varying sizes will be built here, the largest of which is the Bukhtarma Hydroelectric Station. After this series of power stations is completed, it will generate 16 billion kilowatt-hours annually, which will undoubtedly be a huge impetus for the development of industry and agriculture.
    Alma-Ata is the capital of the Kazakh Republic. It was founded in 1854, and was only a fortress at that time. But now it has become a modern city with a population of more than 300,000. Before the revolution, the vast majority of people in Kazakhstan were illiterate. Forty years later, there are already twenty-five universities here, with 40,000 university students, and nearly 1.4 million primary and secondary school students. In addition, there are more than five thousand scientific workers working in more than one hundred scientific research institutions. Alma-Ata is also a place rich in apples, and the suburbs are surrounded by numerous orchards and scenic sanatoriums.

    飞跃前进的哈萨克斯坦
    哈萨克斯坦在苏联这个多民族的大家庭里可以说是一颗宝贵的珍珠，不过在十月革命前它始终埋在地下，只有苏维埃政权才把它从土里发现了出来，并且只有在列宁的民族政策的照耀下，才放出了灿烂的光彩。
    1917年以前的哈萨克斯坦是一片荒凉的地方，地下的丰富无比的宝藏几乎没有触动，人民过着游牧生活，父系制度占着统治地位，在文化、经济上都非常落后。十月革命后四十年哈萨克人民作了一个飞跃式的进步——它挣脱了封建制度的枷锁后，一大步就跨到了社会主义的新时代。
    今天的哈萨克斯坦是一片建设气象。自从1953年苏共中央号召开垦荒地以后，有大批劳动队伍开到了这里，他们仅仅用了三年多时间，就把两千万公顷荒地变成了良田，并建立了五百三十多个规模巨大的国营农场。过去人烟稀少的地带，今天已经是一片绿田。仅在1956年一年哈萨克共和国就交给国家十亿普特粮食，这超过了以前十一年的总和。阿尔泰山和天山的广大而美丽的牧场，使畜牧业得到了广阔的发展天地。这个面积仅次于俄罗斯联邦共和国的哈萨克斯坦，是地广人稀的地方。它的面积几乎有乌克兰的五倍，可是人口只有乌克兰的五分之一。革命前人民在荒凉的土地上过着游牧的贫困愚昧的生活。只有共产党领导的农业社会主义改造和技术改造，才使哈萨克的全部游牧户都集体化而且定居了下来。随后，它的情景就发生了天翻地覆的变化。例如，过去哈萨克斯坦几乎没有工业。在苏维埃政权年代，哈萨克斯坦却出现了三千多个现代化的工业企业。地下的矿藏相继得到发现和开采。哈萨克斯坦有世界上最丰富的铬、钒矿藏。铜、铅、银、镍的储藏量占全苏第一位、煤、石油和锰占第二位。巴尔哈什和哲兹卡兹干出产的铜，齐姆干特和列宁诺格尔斯克的铅都是闻名全苏的。而卡拉干达早已成为全苏第三个采煤基地，仅次于顿巴斯和库兹巴斯。库斯坦奈州和卡拉干达将成为黑色冶金的中心，因为这里既有丰富的铁，又有便宜可用的煤。发展前途是不可限量的。所以人们说，在哈萨克斯坦的库斯坦奈州，现在正在建设苏联的第二个乌拉尔。
    革命前的哈萨克人是住在帐篷里，点的是油灯。在1913年整个哈萨克斯坦的发电量不过是一百三十万度，而1956年则上升到七十亿度！不久前在额尔齐斯河上建起了石山口水电站，在今后几年内还将有十一个大小电站在这里建成，其中最大的是布赫塔明水电站。这一系列电站建成以后每年将发电一百六十亿度，这无疑是工农业发展的巨大推动力。
    阿拉木图是哈萨克共和国的首都，它奠基于1854年，当时只不过是一个堡垒。但现在却已成了一个拥有三十多万人口的现代化城市。革命前在哈萨克斯坦绝大多数人是文盲，四十年后的今天这里已经有二十五座高等学校，大学生有四万人，中小学生人数将近一百四十万。此外还有五千多科学工作者在一百多个科学研究机关中工作。阿拉木图还是个丰产苹果的地方，市郊四周有着众多的果园和风景幽美的疗养院。
