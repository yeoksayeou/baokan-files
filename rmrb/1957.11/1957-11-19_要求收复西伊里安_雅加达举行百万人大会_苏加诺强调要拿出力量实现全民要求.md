　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th. A mass rally of approximately one million people demanding the recovery of West Irian was held at the Merdeka Square in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, this afternoon. The rally was presided over by Jakarta Mayor Sudiro.

　　At this emotionally charged mass rally, attended by the Indonesian President, the Prime Minister and Ministers of the Cabinet, as well as many members of the Parliament and the Constitutional Assembly, a resolution was passed expressing the firm demand for the recovery of West Irian. The resolution demanded that if the United Nations General Assembly could not produce results satisfactory to Indonesia on the West Irian issue, the Indonesian government would take further practical actions to realize this demand of the Indonesian people, first and foremost by fully implementing the abrogation of the Round Table Conference Agreement, nationalizing all important Dutch enterprises in Indonesia, prohibiting Dutch people from entering Indonesia, no longer granting concessions to Dutch enterprises, and revoking the licenses of Dutch lawyers in Indonesia, etc.

　　President Sukarno told the assembled masses, who were holding aloft many Indonesian flags and banners demanding the liberation of West Irian, that if the results obtained from the United Nations are not satisfactory, we must demonstrate our own strength.

　　Sukarno said that the liberation of West Irian is a just demand of all Indonesian people. Dutch occupation of West Irian is like a gun or a dagger pointed at Indonesia's back. Imperialists are using West Irian as a base to carry out infiltration activities to harass the Republic of Indonesia.

　　Sukarno said that one lesson Indonesia has learned in its struggle for national independence is that we cannot beg from the imperialists, we must organize our strength to fight them. Sukarno called on the Indonesian people to unhesitatingly implement the resolution passed at today's mass rally.

　　Former Vice President Hatta, who was absent due to other commitments, delivered a written speech to the rally. Hatta said that he supports the resolution of the rally one hundred percent. He expressed his hope that the country would strengthen unity and conduct the struggle for the recovery of West Irian in an organized manner.

    要求收复西伊里安
    雅加达举行百万人大会
    苏加诺强调要拿出力量实现全民要求
    新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚首都雅加达今日下午在雄牛广场举行了一个约有一百万人参加的要求收回西伊里安的群众大会。大会由雅加达市长苏迪罗主持。
    在这个有印度尼西亚总统、内阁总理和各部部长以及许多国会、制宪议会的议员参加的情绪激昂的群众大会上，通过了一项表示坚决要求收回西伊里安的决议。决议要求：如果联合国大会在西伊里安问题上不能产生使印度尼西亚满意的结果，印度尼西亚政府就采取进一步的实际行动来实现这个印度尼西亚的全国人民的要求，首先完全实现废除圆桌会议协定，把荷兰在印度尼西亚的一切重要企业收归国有，禁止荷兰人进入印度尼西亚，不再给予荷兰企业租让权和撤销在印度尼西亚的荷兰律师执照等。
    苏加诺总统对高举着很多印度尼西亚国旗和要求解放西伊里安的标语牌的到会群众说，如果从联合国取得的结果不能令人满意，我们必须显示我们自己的力量。
    苏加诺说，解放西伊里安是全印度尼西亚人民的一个正义要求。荷兰占领西伊里安好像是指着印度尼西亚的背的一支枪或一支匕首。帝国主义者正在以西伊里安作为基地来进行骚扰印度尼西亚共和国的渗入活动。
    苏加诺说，印度尼西亚在争取民族独立的斗争中获得的一个经验教训是：我们不能向帝国主义者乞求，我们必须把我们的力量组织起来同他们斗争。苏加诺号召印度尼西亚人民毫不犹豫地执行今天群众大会上通过的决议。
    因事缺席的前副总统哈达向大会发表了一篇书面演讲词。哈达说，他百分之百地支持大会的决议。他表示希望全国加强团结，有组织地进行收复西伊里安的斗争。
