Xinhua News Agency, November 4th - The news of the successful launch of the second artificial satellite has become the greeting of the day for the people of the capital. Whether in factories, schools, shops, or government offices, the first words people exchanged this morning were: "Did you hear?" The poet Zang Kejia conveyed this feeling in a hymn he wrote today:

"…The launch time was chosen so well,
The October Revolution is about to arrive,
You spread the victory of socialism throughout the universe,
Looking down from the sky at the jubilant crowds..."

The successful launch of the second artificial satellite has further stimulated the capital's people's love for socialism. Geng Shiping, a housewife on Tianqiao South Street, said to her neighbor: "This is how good the socialist system is!" Sun Maolin, a veteran worker of the "February 7th" Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, said: "The Soviet Union is truly great, we must learn from the experience of the elder brother." Wu Han, vice president of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: "The two artificial satellites of the Soviet Union further prove that scientific undertakings can only develop under the leadership of the Communist Party and under the incomparably superior conditions of the socialist system." Next to the newspaper stand on Wangfujing Street, many people cheered and crowded to buy newspapers, some saying: "Victory upon victory before the festival!" Others added: "In just one month, from October 4th to November 3rd, the Soviet Union has brought us into a new era."

The youth of the capital have even more beautiful ideas. The members of the Communist Youth League in the fine spinning workshop of Beijing No. 2 Cotton Mill originally planned to hold a symposium this morning to celebrate the significance of the October Socialist Revolution, but instead, they all talked about traveling to the moon aboard artificial satellites. Last night at Tsinghua University, the lights in many dormitories were turned off very late, and students gathered in groups, some talking about signing up to be the first interstellar travelers.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 4th - The news of the successful launch of the second artificial satellite by the Soviet Union has added joy to the people of Nanjing. On the streets, on buses, and in factories, government offices, and schools, there was an atmosphere of joy, and people were talking about this happy event. All the newspaper posting sites in the city were crowded all day long, competing to read the news. An old worker at the Nanjing Pharmaceutical Factory said: "On the eve of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union released another big star, making the world even brighter!"

Some units also wrote news bulletins on red paper and posted them in their offices and outside their gates to share the good news with the people. Wan Faquan, a teacher at Nanjing No. 10 Middle School, and several students heard the broadcast news while taking a walk on the evening of the 3rd, and excitedly ran back to their dormitory, and wrote a news bulletin on red paper that night and posted it at the school gate and the dining hall entrance. The good news quickly spread throughout the school. When the newspapers arrived the next morning, people gathered in classrooms, playgrounds, and reading rooms to read the news, with some exclaiming in amazement: "The day when humans travel to the moon is getting closer and closer."

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 4th - After the news of the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial Earth satellite arrived, the people of Wuhan spread the word and cheered the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology.

The Wuhan Observatory and the observation posts of some units are actively preparing for observation. When the scientific workers of the Wuhan Observatory of the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences heard the broadcast last night, they were a sensation. Associate Researcher Zhou Wei said: "Soviet science and technology, especially in many key areas such as automatic control, jet machinery, and high-temperature physics, far surpasses the United States." Many factories, government offices, and schools in Wuhan heard the good news about the second artificial satellite last night, and the Jiang'an Machine Factory broadcast the good news to all its employees this morning.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 4th - The news of the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite caused a sensation in Guangzhou. On the evening of the 3rd, the Yangcheng Evening News issued an "extra" edition at 7:15 PM. The amazing news immediately spread throughout the city, and citizens flocked to the newsboys. The 67,000 copies of the "extra" edition were sold out within an hour.

The Yangcheng Evening News on the 4th published the news of the second artificial satellite in almost a full page. The Southern Daily and Guangzhou Daily on the 4th both published this world-shaking news on the front page.

    第二颗人造卫星带来新的鼓舞和力量
    我国人民更热爱社会主义和苏联
    据新华社4日讯　告诉第二颗人造卫星发射成功的消息，成为今天首都人民的见面礼。无论在工厂、学校、商店或是机关里，人们早上见面的第一句话就是：“你知道了吗？”诗人臧克家在今天写的一首赞歌里传达出了人们的这种心情：
    “……起飞的时间选择得多么好，
    十月革命的佳节就要来到，
    你把社会主义的胜利传遍全宇宙，
    在天空里俯看着欢腾的人潮……。”
    第二颗人造卫星的发射成功，更加激发了首都人民对于社会主义的热爱。天桥南大街的一个家庭主妇耿世平对邻居说：“这就是社会主义制度好！”长辛店机车车辆工厂“二七”老工人孙茂林说：“苏联真伟大，一定得好好学习老大哥的经验。”北京市中苏友好协会副会长吴晗说：“苏联的两颗人造卫星，进一步证明了科学事业只有在共产党的领导下，在社会主义制度下才有发展的无比优越条件。”在王府井大街的报摊旁边，许多人一面欢呼，一面挤着买报，有的说：“节日前真是胜利加胜利！”有的接着说：“从10月4日到11月3日短短的一个月时间，苏联就把我们带到了一个新的时代。”
    首都青年们更有许多美丽的想法。北京国棉二厂细纱车间的共青团员们原定在今天上午的团日里座谈庆祝十月社会主义革命的意义的，结果都谈起了乘坐人造卫星飞往月球旅行的事。清华大学昨天晚上许多宿舍里的电灯都到很晚才关，学生们成群的聚在一起，有的谈论要报名去当第一批星际旅行家。
    据新华社南京4日电　苏联发射成功第二颗人造卫星的消息，又给南京市人民添了一番喜悦。在街道上、公共汽车上以及工厂、机关和学校里，到处喜气洋洋，人们在谈论这一喜事，全市所有贴报处整日人群拥挤，争看报纸消息。南京制药厂一个老工人说：“十月革命节前夕，苏联又放出一颗大星，世界就照的更亮了！”
    还有些单位的工作人员用红纸写了捷报张贴到机关里和大门外，向人们报喜。南京市第十中学的教师万发全和几个学生3日晚散步时听到广播消息后，兴奋地跑回宿舍，当晚就用红纸写了喜报贴在校门口和饭厅门口，喜讯很快传遍了全校。第二天早晨报纸一到，人们在课室、操场、阅览室到处一堆堆地围拢看消息，有人惊异地说：“人类到月球上旅行的日子越来越近了。”
    据新华社武汉4日电　苏联发射第二颗人造地球卫星的消息传来后，武汉人民奔走相告，欢呼苏联科学技术方面的光辉成就。
    武汉的观测站和一些单位的观测所都积极地做好观测准备。中国科学院地球物理研究所武汉观象台科学工作者昨晚听到广播就轰动起来，助理研究员周炜说：“苏联的科学技术，尤其是自动控制、喷气机械、高温物理等许多主要方面，都超过美国很多很多。”武汉的许多工厂、机关、学校在昨晚就收听到关于第二颗人造卫星的喜讯，江岸机厂今天早晨还把这个喜讯向全厂职工广播。
    据新华社广州4日电　苏联发射第二颗人造卫星的消息轰动了广州市。3日晚，羊城晚报在七时十五分出了“号外”，这个惊人的消息立即传遍全城，市民都蜂涌地聚集到报童的周围，六万七千份“号外”在一小时之内就卖光了。
    4日的羊城晚报又以差不多一版的篇幅刊载了第二颗人造卫星的消息。4日的南方日报、广州日报都以头版头条刊载了这一震动世界的新闻。
