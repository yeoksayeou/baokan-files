Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 18th: The Fujian Provincial Transmission Conference of the Chinese Catholic Representatives Conference was held in Fuzhou City from October 10th to November 16th.

　　The conference unfolded discussions on issues such as Catholics taking the socialist road, anti-imperialism and patriotism, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries within religious circles, and the relationship between Chinese Catholicism and the Vatican. The vast majority of representatives, in their speeches, believed that patriotic Catholics should, like the rest of the nation, follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party, love the motherland, and safeguard world peace. They believed that the Vatican was an instrument of aggression for American imperialism and that patriotic Catholics should thoroughly sever ties with the Vatican politically and economically. However, right-wing elements among the representatives, Li Guanghui (priest of Shaowu Catholic Church), Huang Ximing (priest of Fuzhou Fanchuanpu Catholic Church), and Ye Ershi (priest of Yongtai Catholic Church), publicly defended the reactionary face of the Vatican at the conference. They openly opposed the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Chinese Catholics, saying that "the Chinese Catholic Church must be under the leadership of the Vatican Pope" and that "the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association must remove the words 'Chinese'." They also said that the implementation of independence and autonomy for Chinese Catholicism must be under the principles of "one, holy, catholic," saying that not doing so would be "schismatic." Ye Ershi even shamelessly said: "For a Catholic, spiritual cultivation is most important; patriotism is not important." Li Guanghui also proposed that the Roman Curia's "excommunication" of patriotic bishops and priests Li Weiguang and Li Yintao, who participated in the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, was "valid," and that the election of Zhang Shirang, acting bishop of the Shanghai Diocese, was "illegal and invalid."

　　The representatives expressed extreme anger at the fallacious arguments of these right-wing elements within the church, who obsequiously defended the Vatican's reactionary political stance, and severely refuted them. Lin Quan, acting bishop of the Fuzhou Diocese, Huang Ziyu, acting bishop of the Xiamen Diocese, Huang Zusheng, priest of Putian Hanjiang Catholic Church, and thirty-two other bishops and priests, and more than forty Catholic representatives, unanimously pointed out in their speeches that the implementation of independence and autonomy for the Chinese Catholic Church was to completely change the colonial and semi-colonial status that imperialism had brought to the Chinese Church in the old China era. Maintaining a purely religious relationship with the Vatican, and obeying the Pope on matters of faith and doctrine that should be believed and practiced, under the premise of not violating the interests and independent dignity of the motherland, is not "schismatic" at all. Lin Ziding, acting bishop of the Fu'an Diocese, said: "Patriotism is God's commandment and the sacred duty of every citizen. Canon law also requires us to 'love the reasonable country.' Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, New China has been built into an independent, autonomous, and strong socialist country. Isn't such a country worthy of our love?" Chen Mingyuan, priest of Longxi Houban Catholic Church, said: "If patriotism is a crime, then the fourth commandment of the Ten Commandments should be abolished." Many representatives unanimously pointed out that patriotism is a righteous act, not only without guilt but also meritorious. Zhao Kui, priest of Fuzhou Aowei Lane Catholic Church, said: "The imperialist element Libberecht resolutely opposed the liberation cause of the Chinese people and organized the reactionary Legion of Mary in an attempt to subvert the people's regime. The People's Government's expulsion of him from the country was completely legal. Li Weiguang's participation in expelling Libberecht was a patriotic and righteous action. The Roman Pope's 'excommunication' of Acting Bishop Li Weiguang is unfair, unreasonable, and also invalid." Xu Juncheng, vice president of the Fujian United Seminary of Catholicism, and other priests also cited canon law to explain that the election of Zhang Shirang as acting bishop by the Shanghai Diocese, for the benefit of more than 100,000 Catholics in Shanghai, was completely legal; the Roman Pope's unreasonable denial of Bishop Zhang Shirang was an infringement on the interests of the clergy and laity of the Shanghai Diocese and an act of interference in our internal affairs. Many representatives also used concrete facts in their speeches to criticize the reactionary remarks of Li Guanghui who smeared the land reform movement, the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and the agricultural cooperation movement. After everyone presented the facts, reasoned, and repeatedly debated, the right-wing elements were rendered speechless and completely isolated.

　　The conference elected Lin Quan, Huang Zusheng, Huang Ziyu, Lin Ziding, Su Wu, Huang Zhaoying, and twenty-three other bishops, priests, and Catholics to form the preparatory committee for the Fujian Provincial Catholic Patriotic Association.

　　At the closing ceremony on the 16th, Su Wu, Secretary-General of the Conference and Director of the Fuzhou Catholic Patriotic Association, delivered a summary report of the conference. In his report, he emphasized that Catholics are part of the people and must therefore support the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, resolutely take the socialist road, thoroughly sever ties with the Vatican politically and economically, implement independence and autonomy, and run the church independently by Chinese clergy and laity. He also called on all clergy and laity to resolutely draw a clear line with the right-wing elements within the church.

　　At the closing ceremony, a total of one hundred and twenty-five bishops, priests, nuns, preachers, and Catholics from various regions attending the conference unanimously passed the resolution to support the Chinese Catholic Representatives Conference and the resolution to protest the Vatican's denial of Zhang Shirang, acting bishop of the Shanghai Diocese.

    站稳反帝爱国立场抗议教廷非法决议
    痛击天主教内右派坚决走社会主义道路
    中国天主教代表会议福建省传达会议在福州举行
    新华社福州18日电　中国天主教代表会议福建省传达会议，10月10日到11月16日在福州市举行。
    会议对天主教徒走社会主义道路、反帝爱国、宗教界肃反、中国天主教同梵蒂冈教廷的关系等问题展开了讨论。绝大多数代表在发言中都认为，爱国的教徒应该和全国人民一样在共产党领导下，走社会主义道路，热爱祖国，维护世界和平。认为梵蒂冈是美帝国主义的侵略工具，爱国教徒要在政治上、经济上同梵蒂冈彻底地割断关系。但是，代表中的右派分子李光辉（邵武天主堂神甫）、黄希明（福州泛船甫天主堂神甫）和叶而适（永泰天主堂神甫）等三人，却在会上公开为梵蒂冈的反动面目辩护。他们公开反对中国天主教徒的反帝爱国运动，他们说“中国天主教会必须在梵蒂冈教宗领导下”，“中国天主教友爱国会必须取消‘中国’两个字”。又说，中国天主教实行独立自主必须在“至一、至圣、至公”的原则下，他们说不这样就是“裂教”。叶而适甚至无耻地说：“做教友的圣修最要紧，爱国是不要紧的。”李光辉还提出罗马教廷“绝罚”参加反帝爱国运动的爱国主教、神甫李维光和李荫桃是“有效”的，而上海教区代理主教张士琅的选举是“不合法和无效的”。
    代表们对教内右派分子这种奴颜婢膝地为梵蒂冈反动政治立场辩护的谬论表示极大愤怒，并严予驳斥。福州教区代理主教林泉、厦门教区代理主教黄子玉、莆田涵江天主堂神甫黄祖生等三十二个主教、神甫和四十多个教友代表，在发言中一致指出：中国天主教会实行独立自主，是为了彻底改变旧中国时代帝国主义带给中国教会的殖民地半殖民地状态。在不违反祖国利益和独立尊严的前提下，同梵蒂冈教廷保持纯宗教的关系，在当信当行的教规教义上服从教宗，这根本不是什么“裂教”。福安教区代理主教林子鼎说：“爱国是天主的诫命，也是每个公民的神圣职责，圣教法典也要我们‘爱合理的国家’，今天新中国在共产党领导下，已建成一个独立自主的强大的社会主义国家，这样的国家，难道不值得我们爱吗？”龙溪后坂天主堂神甫陈明元说：“如果爱国有罪，那么天主十诫中的第四诫就要取消。”许多代表一致指出：爱国是正义的行为，不仅无罪，而且有功。福州澳尾巷天主堂神甫赵魁说：“帝国主义分子黎培里，坚决反对中国人民的解放事业，并组织反动圣母军企图颠覆人民政权，人民政府把他驱逐出境完全是合法的。李维光参加驱逐黎培里是爱国的、正义的行动。罗马教皇‘绝罚’李维光代主教是不公道、不合理而且也是无效的。”天主教福建联合修院副院长徐君成等神甫，还引用教律说明上海教区为了上海十多万教友的利益，选举张士琅为代理主教是完全合法的；罗马教皇无理否认张士琅主教，是侵犯上海教区神长、教友的利益，干涉我国内政的行为。许多代表在发言中还用具体事实批驳了李光辉污蔑土地改革运动、粮食统购统销政策和农业合作化运动的反动言论。右派分子在大家摆事实、讲道理，反复进行争辩以后，都词穷理屈，陷于完全孤立地位。
    会议选举了林泉、黄祖生、黄子玉、林子鼎、苏梧、黄昭英等二十三个主教、神甫和教友，组成福建省天主教友爱国会筹备会。
    在16日的闭幕会上，大会秘书长、福州市天主教友爱国会主任苏梧，作了会议的总结报告。他在报告中强调说：教徒是人民的一分子，因此必须拥护中国共产党和人民政府，坚决走社会主义道路，彻底割断同梵蒂冈在政治、经济上的联系，实行独立自主，由中国神长、教友自办教会。他还号召全体神职人员和教友，必须坚决同教内的右派分子划清界限。
    在闭幕会上，出席会议的各地区主教、神甫和修女、传道、教友共一百二十五人，一致通过了拥护中国天主教代表会议的决议和抗议梵蒂冈教廷否认上海教区代理主教张士琅的决议。
