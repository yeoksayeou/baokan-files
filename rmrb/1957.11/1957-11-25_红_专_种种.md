    Various Aspects of "Red" and "Expert"
    Liu Qi
    In the fervent discussion of "Red" versus "Expert," some advocate "Expert first, then Red," opposing "Both Red and Expert." According to them, focusing on "Red" will affect "Expertise"; moreover, "Once Expert, naturally Red," so why bother paying extra attention to "Red"?

    Clearly, the crux of the debate lies in whether or not to pay attention to "Redness."

    "Once Expert, naturally Red" sounds appealing, but it's not necessarily true. There are plenty of examples; the large number of right-wing elements among intellectuals is also evidence. The major movements after liberation, especially the ideological remolding movement of intellectuals, aimed to gradually make intellectuals Red. Some have indeed been dyed Red, but many only have a superficial layer of Red, like radishes, red on the outside and white inside. As for right-wing elements, they have particularly strong qualities and are not easily influenced. Some of them are very "Expert," but they don't have a trace of Redness. If they can't even be dyed Red, how can we talk about "naturally Red"? "Once Expert, naturally Red" is simply self-deception.

    "Paying attention to 'Red' will affect 'Expertise'" – I don't know what basis there is for this claim. But there is much evidence to the contrary. In just forty years, Soviet science and technology surpassed the United States, which had been ahead, in some of the most important fields. Artificial satellites were first launched by Red scientists, while White scientists are still at a loss. This is the influence of "Redness" on "Expertise." But it is an influence that promotes development and improvement, and it is precisely the "influence" we need.

    We can also look at examples from our own country. At the beginning of the People's Republic of China, when it came to cultivating Red experts, we faced two types of people: one was "Expert" but not "Red," namely bourgeois intellectuals. This was a usable asset left to us by the old society. The other was "Red" but not "Expert," these were comrades in the revolutionary ranks who could be trained to become experts but were not yet experts. To turn these two groups into "Red experts," the former had to go from "Expert" to "Red," and the latter had to go from "Red" to "Expert." We have been working hard in this direction for eight years, and some people in both groups have already "changed." Comparing these two groups, we can find that, in terms of "Expertise," the people who went from "Red" to "Expert" spent far less time on "Expertise" than those who were "Expert" but not "Red" spent in the old society. In terms of "Redness," the degree of "Redness" of those who went from "Expert" to "Red" is worse than that of those who were originally "Red." This is probably because of whether the original foundation was "Red."

    We can also look at some experts who originally existed in the revolutionary ranks. They appeared to be very Red on the surface, but because the original foundation was White, and they were unwilling to remove this White foundation, they added a layer of protection on the White foundation when putting on Redness. Over time, after being washed by heavy rain, the Redness peeled off, and the Whiteness was still revealed. The cases of Feng Xuefeng and Ding Ling illustrate that it is much more difficult to become thoroughly Red than to become an expert.

    For young students who are neither "Red" nor "Expert," profound lessons can be learned from the relationship between "Red" and "Expert." In fact, whether it is "Expert first, then Red" or "Red first, then Expert," it takes twice the effort and time. The reason why we want to change these two types of people is because we are compelled by existing facts; there is no other way to do it. Now that we are starting to cultivate a new generation, shouldn't we emphasize both Redness and Expertise, to save the wasted time and effort that we spent in the past because the people had no power?

    The claims of "Once Expert, naturally Red" and "Redness hinders Expertise" are both deceitful. Their essence is to maintain the White foundation. Otherwise, would there be non-Red, non-White, colorless and transparent intellectuals?

    The reason why some people believe "Once Expert, naturally Red" is that they think as long as they are "Expert" and have the ability, people cannot do without them, the so-called "Knowing physics and chemistry, you can go anywhere in the world without fear." This is actually very ridiculous. There is no one in the world who is indispensable. Some bourgeois intellectuals, having lost their foothold in capitalism and unwilling to stand on a solid footing in socialism, became a kind of "'thieves on the beam' neither touching the sky nor touching the earth," and after a somersault, some people finally stood on solid ground. Do you still want to cultivate the new generation into "thieves on the beam" first, and then let them take a somersault?

    For the sake of the country and the people, and for the sake of the youth themselves, we must pay attention to "Redness," and not just from university, but from primary school. Because university students come from primary school students. Moreover, Red experts and Red workers are both very much needed.

### “红”“专”种种

    “红”“专”种种
    刘起
    在“红”与“专”的热烈讨论中，有人主张“先专后红”，反对“又红又专”。据他们说，先注意“红”就要影响了“专”；何况“一专自然红”，又何必格外去注意“红”呢？
    显然，争论的焦点在于要不要注意“红”上。
    “一专自然红”，说得倒也十分动听。其实却未必。要例子多得很，知识分子中右派分子之多，也是证据。解放后的几大运动，特别是知识分子的思想改造运动，其目的，也是要逐渐把知识分子染红的。有一部分人确也已染红，但许多人只染了一张皮毛，好像水萝卜，外红内白的。至于右派分子，倒因为他们身上有特别强的质地、是近朱也不赤的，他们之中有些人倒是很“专”，但何曾有一毫红色。染都染不红，哪里还能谈得上“自然红”。“一专自然红”，只不过是自欺欺人罢了。
    “一注意‘红’就要影响‘专’”，不知此说可有什么根据。但反证却多得很。短短四十年，苏联科学技术在某些最重要的领域就超过了曾经走在前面的美国，人造卫星首先由红色科学家手中送出，白色科学家至今还在那里手足无措，这也是“红”对“专”的影响。但这是促其发展提高的影响，而且正是我们需要的“影响”。
    还可以看看我们国家的例子。建国之初，就培养红色专家来说，我们面对着两种人，一种是“专”而不“红”的，即资产阶级知识分子，这是旧社会留给我们一笔可以利用的财富；另一种是“红”而不“专”的，这是革命队伍里那些可以培养成为专家尚未成为专家的同志。要把这两部分人变成“红色专家”，对前者要由“专”到“红”，后者要由“红”到“专”。八年来我们就是这样努力的，而且也各有了已经“变”了的人。把这两种人比一比看，就可以发现，从“专”来说，由“红”到“专”的人，为“专”花去的时间，远比那些由“专”而不“红”的人在旧社会花去的时间要少；从“红”来说，由“专”到“红”的人，“红”的程度，比原来就“红”的人要差。这原因大概就由于原来的底子是否“红”。
    还可以再看看，在革命队伍里原有的一些专家，看来外表是很红的，但由于原来的底子是白的，而且他不愿去掉这白底子，在着红色的时候，先在白底子上加了一层保护物，天长日久，经过大雨的冲洗，红色剥落，白色便依然露了出来，冯雪峰、丁玲的事，是不难于说明成为一个红透了的，远比成为一个专家要困难的多的。
    对于既不“红”又不“专”的青年学生来说，从“红”与“专”的关系中，是完全能够找出深刻的教训的。其实无论先“专”后“红”或先“红”后“专”，都是费了双倍的力气和时间的。我们所以要这样去改变那两种人，是迫于既成事实，不这样作没有其他法子。现在我们着手培养新的一代的时候，岂不应该红专并重，以省去过去由于人民无权而花去的那种冤枉时间和力气。
    “一专自然红”和“红能误专”的说法，都是欺人之谈，它的实质还是要保持白色的底子，否则，难道还会有不红不白无色透明的知识分子不成。
    所以认为“一专自然红”，是有人以为只要我“专”了，有了本事，你们便离不得我，所谓“懂得物理化，走遍天下都不怕”者是也。这其实是很可笑的。天下没有离不得的人。有些资产阶级知识分子，失去了资本主义的立足点，又不肯脚踏实地立足在社会主义上，因而变成了一种“上不沾天下不着地的‘梁上君子’”，翻了一个大跟斗之后，有些人才脚踏实地了。难道还想在培养新的一代人时，也先把他们培养成“梁上君子”，然后再让他们翻个大跟斗吗？
    为国家和人民着想，为青年自己着想，都必须要注意到“红”，而且不只是从大学才开始，从小学就应开始注意到“红”，因为大学生是从小学生来的。何况红的专家和红的劳动者同样都是十分需要的啊。
