To the Mountainous Areas!
Hu Jiwei

China's land area is "eight parts mountains, one part water, and one part farmland." Developing the mountainous areas, which account for eight-tenths of the country's land, is a major direction for China's future agricultural development. Moreover, China's deep mountains, rich in mineral resources, are a treasure trove for the development of our industry. However, many people do not understand the loveliness of the mountainous areas, especially the loveliness of the people in the mountainous areas.

The people in the mountainous areas are full of revolutionary optimism, full of indomitable fighting spirit, and full of love for every mountain, river, plant, and tree in the mountainous areas.

Some say the mountainous areas are hard, but that depends on how they understand it.

In Shangxian Longwangmiao Township, a model township for mountainous area construction in Shangluo Special District, Shaanxi Province, the female members of the third team of the Qixing Agricultural Cooperative, in the terracing movement, wanted to remove all the stones from a half-mu stony beach. The older ones carried, the younger ones shouldered, and the broken ones were picked up. Their hands were rubbed raw, and their shoulders were swollen. Is this a hardship? They don't see it that way. They originally contracted for 800 work points, but they spent more than 1,200 work points to clean up the stones. Is this bad luck? They don't see it that way either. They were so happy when they sped up and the male team members couldn't keep up with their transportation of stones after the explosions. They were so proud when they made huge voluntary contributions to complete the task. They were really ecstatic when they saw that the stony beach had become a terraced field, yielding 370-380 jin of wheat per mu, 110-120 jin more than the surrounding wheat fields.

The comrades of the 407 Geological Exploration Team, exploring the treasures of the Qinling Mountains, braved the pouring rain and stood in the chest-deep torrent to build a scaffold for the drilling rig. They built it after it was washed away, and then built it again after it was washed away again, finally ensuring that drilling started on time. Is this also a hardship? To help the 407 team transport a machine part weighing a thousand kilograms into the deep mountains, thirty or forty local farmers carried it, climbed mountains and crossed rivers along the rugged and dangerous rocky path, carrying it for more than thirty li to the construction site. Is this also a hardship? They don't see it that way. The roar of the drilling rig is the sound of their victorious laughter, and the glittering light of the newly unearthed ore is the bright gaze emitted from their happy eyes.

Those who say the mountainous areas are hard don't really understand what hardship is.

People's outlook on life determines their "view of hardship and happiness." The greatest happiness of a revolutionary is to struggle for the revolutionary ideal, is the realization of the revolutionary ideal. Revolutionary struggle, including the struggle against nature, is certainly not a casual performance, nor is it strolling along the beach facing the evening glow. It is certainly not as "interesting" and "easy" as some people imagine. It is indeed full of the "difficulties and hardships" and "bitterness" found in general dictionaries, and even great "suffering" and "sacrifice." However, revolutionary optimists do not understand the true meaning of these words literally. They can find the greatest happiness in life in this hardship, and can taste true sweetness in this bitterness.

Are the mountainous areas really hard? Some people like to compare the mountainous areas with the plains and cities, and see the mountainous areas as hard in this way. But why not compare today's mountainous areas with the mountainous areas of the past? Before liberation, Longwangmiao Township was "skinned and sucked dry" by landlords and bullies, and the people lived a poor life of "eating by shadow, sleeping by stars." After liberation, especially in the recent short period of two years, hard work has yielded fruitful results. Barren mountains have become irrigated terraced fields, and grain-deficient townships have become grain-surplus townships. Everyone has new clothes, thatched houses have disappeared, and thermos bottles, flashlights, rubber shoes, and fountain pens have become common daily necessities. The average income per household in the township has reached the level of local well-to-do middle peasants. Is this also called hardship? Look at how the people in the mountainous areas answer this question. You say their life is hard now, they say: "Only those who have suffered in the hell of the old society know the good days of today." You say their struggle is difficult now, they hold out their little fingers and say: "Compared with the domestic revolutionary war period, this is a small matter!" You say the conditions in the mountainous areas are more difficult than on the plains, they laugh heartily and joke: "The plains only have one god of wealth (agriculture), but the mountainous areas have four great gods of wealth (agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations)!" This is the way the people in the mountainous areas see things. Some people don't compare the mountainous areas today and in the past, and always want to compare the mountainous areas with the plains and cities. How small and short-sighted such people seem compared to the heroic people in the mountainous areas!

Of course, life like that in Longwangmiao Township is a relatively good life in the mountainous areas, but Longwangmiao Township did not fall from the sky, nor was it moved from the plains, nor was it inherited on the basis of wealth. Rather, it was the people in the mountainous areas who transformed a very poor environment with their diligent hands. This shows that our responsibility is how to make the mountainous areas that are not as good as Longwangmiao Township catch up with Longwangmiao, and to make all the mountainous areas greatly exceed the current level of Longwangmiao. To achieve this, we should first remove from the minds of some people the idea of underestimating the mountainous areas and fearing to suffer hardships in the mountainous areas.

We should learn the heroic and tenacious fighting spirit of the people in the mountainous areas like Longwangmiao, we should love the mountainous areas that account for 80% of the country's land area, and we should vigorously support the development and construction of the mountainous areas. During the rectification and streamlining of institutions at all levels, the cadres who are being transferred to lower levels should respond to the call of the Third Plenary Session, and go to the mountainous areas with enthusiasm to participate in the glorious labor army of building the mountainous areas. The comrades of the Fourth Detachment of the 407 Geological Exploration Team of the Anshan Branch of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry left the modern city of Anshan and came to the remote mountains of Qinling. When they arrived in June this year, they slept in mat sheds and ate coarse grains, starting work under extremely difficult conditions. The Party organizations and the masses of the people in the mountainous areas warmly welcomed them, and built houses for them in just two months. Their difficult environment is improving. Now, road builders are preparing to build roads for their work to proceed smoothly. Their difficult environment will be further improved. When exploration is successful and mining begins, they will work together with the mining workers to create a modern new city with their own hands in that barren mountain. "Settling down in Qinling and turning the poor Qinling into a rich Qinling!" is the bold statement expressing their determination.

The development and construction of the mountainous areas requires vigorous support. The mountainous areas need a lot of energetic young and middle-aged labor, especially laborers with cultural knowledge, a large number of scientific and technical personnel in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and mineral development, and a large number of talents in transportation, supply and marketing, trade, medical and health care, and cultural education. "Change the bad habit of people in the plains being unwilling to go to the mountains!" "Settle down in the mountainous areas!" These have now become loud slogans of many cadres being transferred to lower levels. But there are still some people who do not understand the mountainous areas, do not believe in the strength of the masses in the mountainous areas, and lack enthusiasm for the construction of the mountainous areas. Not only are some people still unwilling to go to the mountainous areas, but also a few cadres who originally worked in the mountainous areas are not at ease working in the mountainous areas. We believe that the thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland will surely respond to the call of the Party, actively participate in the ranks of building the mountainous areas, and set off a great upsurge in building the mountainous areas. The erroneous ideas mentioned above will surely be washed away by this tide.

Among the people in the mountainous areas, many songs about the beautiful prospects of building the mountainous areas have already been circulating. We have compiled them below, which is undoubtedly a great encouragement to all those who are willing to participate in the construction of the mountainous areas. Who can not yearn for such a bright future?

Distant mountains, high mountains, forest mountains, nearby mountains, low mountains, flower and fruit mountains. Sloping fields on the mountainside become terraced fields, river beaches become rice granaries.

Water conservancy is built on and under the mountains, eliminating floods and droughts. Pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks are raised in every household, and cattle, donkeys, and mules are crowded in the pens.

Underground treasures are turned upside down, and mines and factories are built on a large scale. Electric lights, telephones, and electrification, large and small machines run in the fields.

Transportation is developed with vehicles and ships, and supply and marketing purchases are sound. Culture and education are greatly developed, and medical and health care are greatly improved.

Socialism has entered the mountains, and the mountainous areas have been built into a paradise.

    到山区去！
    胡绩伟
    我国国土面积是“八山一水一分田”，开发占国土十分之八的山区，就是我国今后发展农业生产的一个主要方向。而蕴藏着丰富矿产的我国的深山，更是我国发展工业的宝库。但是，很多人不了解山区的可爱，特别是不了解山区人民的可爱。
    山区人民充满着革命的乐观情绪，充满着艰韧不拔的战斗精神，充满着对山区一山一水一草一木的热爱。
    有人说山区苦，那就要看他是怎样去理解。
    陕西商雒专区建设山区的模范乡商县龙王庙乡，七星农业社第三队的女社员们，在修梯田运动中，为了在一块半亩大的石滩上搬走所有的石头，她们大的抬、小的担、碎的拾，把手磨烂了、肩抬肿了，这是苦事吗？她们不这样看。她们原来包工八百分，结果花了一千二百多个工分才把石头搬干净，这是倒霉事吗？她们也不这样看。当她们加快速度、男队员炸石头赶不上她们搬运的时候，她们多么高兴。当她们为了完成任务付出了巨大的义务劳动，她们多么骄傲。当看到那块石滩变成梯田、每亩收麦三百七八十斤，比周围麦地多收一百一二十斤，她们真乐得心花怒放了。
    开发秦岭宝藏的地质勘探队四○七队的同志们，冒着倾盆大雨，站在淹到胸部的急流里为钻探机搭架，冲走了又搭，再冲走再搭，终于保证了按时开钻，这也是苦事吗？为了帮助四○七队把一个重达千斤的机器部件运进深山，当地农民三四十人抬着它，沿着崎岖峻险的乱石小路上翻山过河，抬了三十多里才送到工地，难道这也是苦事吗？他们都不这样看。钻探机的轰隆响声就是他们的胜利的笑声，那些新出土的矿石的闪闪光芒，就是他们快乐的眼珠里发射出来的炯炯目光。
    说山区苦的人其实并不懂得什么是苦。
    人们的人生观决定着他们的“苦乐观”。革命者的最大快乐，是为革命的理想而奋斗，是革命理想的实现。革命斗争包括同自然界的斗争，当然不是逢场作戏，也不是迎着晚霞在海滨散步，当然不如某些人想像那样“有趣”和那样“轻松”。这中间确实充满着一般辞典上那种“艰难困苦”和“辛酸苦辣”，甚至有极大的“痛苦”和“牺牲”。但是革命的乐观主义者并不是从字面上去理解这些辞汇的真义，他们能够在这种困苦中求得人生最大的快乐，能够在这种苦中尝到真正的甜。
    山区真的苦吗？有些人喜欢拿山区同平原和城市来比较，这样来看山区苦。但是为什么不拿今天的山区和过去的山区来比呢？解放前，龙王庙乡被地主恶霸“剥开肉皮抽干油，肥山变成瘦骨头”，人民过着“吃饭照影影、睡觉看星星”的穷苦生活。经过解放后，特别是最近短短两年的努力，辛勤的劳动结了丰硕的果实，贫瘠的山地变成了水浇的梯田，缺粮乡变成了余粮乡，人人有新衣，破草房绝了迹，暖水瓶、手电筒、胶鞋、自来水笔成了普遍的日用品，全乡每户的平均收入达到了当地富裕中农的水平。难道这也叫苦吗？看看山区人民怎样回答这个问题。你说他们现在生活苦，他们说：“只有从旧社会地狱里受过煎熬的人才知道今天的好日月。”你说他们现在斗争艰苦，他们伸出小指头说：“同国内革命战争时期比，这是小不点！”你说山区条件比平地困难，他们更是哈哈大笑，打趣地说：“平川只有一个财神（农业），山区却有四个大财神（农业、林业、牧业、副业）哩！”这就是山区人民看问题的方法。有些人不用山区今昔来对比，总想用山区同平原和城市来对比。这样的人同英雄的山区人民比起来显得多么渺小和近视啊！
    当然，在山区里像龙王庙乡这样的生活是比较好的生活，但是龙王庙并不是从天上掉下来的，也不是从平原搬去的，更不是在富裕的基础上承继下来的，而是山区人民凭着勤劳的双手把十分贫苦的环境改造过来的。这就说明，我们的责任，就是如何使不及龙王庙乡的山区建设得赶上龙王庙，而且使所有的山区大大超过目前龙王庙的水平。要做到这点，首先就应该从一些人的内心去掉那种轻视山区和怕到山区吃苦的思想。
    我们应该学习像龙王庙这样的山区人民那种英勇顽强的战斗精神，应该热爱占祖国国土面积80％的山区，应该大力支援开发山区和建设山区。在各级机关整风和紧缩机构的时候，下放的干部应该响应三中全会的号召，怀着满腔热情到山区去，参加建设山区的光荣的劳动大军去。冶金工业部地质局鞍山分局的地质勘探队四○七队第四分队的同志们，离开了现代化的鞍山市来到了秦岭的荒山丛中。当今年6月他们到达时，睡席篷、吃粗粮，在极端困难的条件下开始工作。山区的党组织和人民群众热烈地欢迎他们，在短短两个月的时间内就为他们修起了住宅。他们的困难环境正在改善着。现在，筑路工人为了他们的工作顺利进展，正在准备修筑公路。他们的困难环境将得到更大的改善。当勘探成功、进行开采时，他们将和开矿工人同志一起，在那个荒山里，用自己的双手创建起一座现代化的新城市。“在秦岭安家落户，把穷秦岭变为富秦岭！”就是表示他们决心的豪语。
    山区的开发和建设需要大力的支援。山区需要很多朝气勃勃的青壮年劳动力，特别需要有文化知识的劳动者，需要大批农业、林业、牧畜业、副业和矿藏开发的科学技术人员，需要大批交通运输、供销贸易、医药卫生和文化教育等等各方面的人才。“把平地人不愿意上山的不良风气改变过来！”“到山区去安家落户！”这些目前已经成为许多下放干部响亮的口号。但是仍然有一些人不了解山区，不相信山区群众的力量，对山区建设缺乏热情。不仅有人仍然不愿意到山区去，还有少数原来在山区工作的干部也不安心在山区工作。我们相信，祖国的千万优秀儿女一定会响应党的号召，踊跃参加山区建设的行列，掀起一个伟大的建设山区的高潮。上面所说的那些错误思想，一定会被这股潮水冲洗干净的。
    在山区人民中，已经流传着许多关于建设山区美丽远景的赞歌，我们综合编写在下面，这无疑是对愿意参加山区建设的一切人们的莫大鼓舞。谁能不为这种灿烂的前途而向往呢？
    远山高山森林山，近山低山花果山。山腰坡地变梯田，河滩变成米粮川。
    山上山下兴水利，消除水灾和天旱。猪羊鸡鸭家家养，牛驴骡马挤满圈。
    地下宝藏大翻身，矿山工厂大兴建。电灯电话电气化，大小机器跑田间。
    交通发达行车船，供销收购都健全。文化教育大发展，医药卫生大改善。
    社会主义进了山，山区建设成乐园。
