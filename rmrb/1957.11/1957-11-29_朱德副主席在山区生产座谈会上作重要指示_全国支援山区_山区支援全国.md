Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Vice Chairman Zhu De said: Developing mountain resources and constructing mountain areas is a task for the entire people and the entire Party. We must mobilize the entire Party and work together to do a good job in constructing mountain areas.

Vice Chairman Zhu De made this request at a symposium on mountain area production convened by the Rural Work Department of the CCP Central Committee. He gave important instructions on mountain area construction work at this meeting.

He said that mountain areas, like plains, have seen considerable development in economic construction and significant improvement in people's lives in recent years, based on the fundamental completion of socialist transformation. However, compared with the plains, the lives of people in mountain areas are still difficult, and the resources of the mountain areas have not been developed on a large scale. There are still many problems in the work in mountain areas. The biggest problem is that many regions and comrades do not pay enough attention to the work in mountain areas. They do not understand that if the resources of the mountain areas are not developed, China's socialist construction will face great difficulties.

He said, why is mountain area construction so important? This is because mountain areas account for more than two-thirds of the country's land area, and the population, cultivated land, and grain output all account for about one-third. In particular, mountain areas have endless natural wealth and treasures, not only forest trees, mountain products, and medicinal materials on the surface, but also various rich mineral deposits underground. Therefore, the production potential of mountain areas is enormous.

Mountain areas have vast land and sparse population, which is the opposite of the situation in the plains and coastal areas where there is little land and a large population. Precisely because of this, developing mountain areas can greatly solve the employment problem for the surplus population in cities and plains.

Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out that because the construction of mountain areas is so important, the Central Committee regards the construction of mountain areas as one of the important tasks of the Second and Third Five-Year Plans, and the Central Committee has issued the call of "going to the countryside and up the mountains" to the people of the whole country and all revolutionary cadres.

Vice Chairman Zhu said that the development policy for mountain area economy has already been given principled instructions in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. This is: "In accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions and implementing diversified operations, develop mountain area agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and the production of various local specialties." This policy is completely correct.

Then, he emphatically instructed on the direction of mountain area construction. He said: The direction of mountain area construction should be from self-sufficiency in mountain areas to the unification of the national economy and national economic exchange. This process is also the process from national support for mountain area construction to mountain area support for national construction. Once the construction of mountain areas is launched, the wealth of the mountain areas will surely be developed continuously and contributed to the national construction cause. That will reach a new period, which is the period of mountain areas supporting the whole country. This is precisely the great purpose of our construction of mountain areas. It is completely wrong not to see this bright prospect and to think that the Party's proposal to build mountain areas is only an emergency measure. Vice Chairman Zhu said that improving transportation in mountain areas is of extremely great significance for mobilizing national strength to support the construction of mountain areas at present, and for utilizing the resources of mountain areas to support national construction in the future, because only in this way can things from outside be transported in, and materials from mountain areas can be transported out. Of course, developing transportation in mountain areas is a long-term task, so mountain areas must still adopt many self-sufficient methods at present. This is to try to avoid the waste of opposite transportation. For this reason, it is necessary to develop small-scale industries and processing industries in mountain areas on a large scale, such as brewing, oil extraction, cotton ginning, rice milling, flour milling, egg beating, manufacturing of non-staple foods, manufacturing of medicinal materials, and other industries that can use local materials, and even chemical fiber industry, etc. In this way, on the one hand, the raw materials of the mountain areas are utilized locally, and at the same time, the economic construction of the mountain areas is developed. Therefore, everyone's request for "technology to go to the mountains" is very correct. But for this purpose, and also for the long-term purpose of building mountain areas, it is necessary to improve transportation in mountain areas.

Strengthening commercial work in mountain areas plays a great role in developing mountain area production. Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out that in commercial work in mountain areas, special attention should be paid to giving play to the role of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. Because mountain villages are scattered and the scale of production is small, it is not cost-effective to set up special state-owned commercial institutions. Grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives should be responsible for the tasks of outward transfer, domestic sales, purchasing, and guiding the production of local specialties, and combine rural handicraftsmen and surplus rural labor to process products and produce and sell them themselves. At the same time, consideration should also be given to combining grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, and credit cooperatives into a trinity, with centralized leadership and separate management.

He said that many products of mountain areas are not only needed domestically, but are also important export materials. According to statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Trade, mountain area products account for more than 50% of existing export materials. From this, it can be seen that mountain areas not only occupy an important position in future socialist construction, but also are very important at present in supporting exports, supporting industrial construction, and providing building materials and living materials to the whole country. From this, it can be seen how important it is for improving commercial work in mountain areas.

Vice Chairman Zhu emphasized that the construction of mountain areas is not only the task of the agricultural sector, but also the common task of industry, commerce, finance, taxation, culture and education, science, health, and other aspects. It requires all departments to cooperate under the unified leadership of the Party committee. This is a task for the entire people and the entire Party. We must mobilize the entire Party and work together to do a good job in mountain area production and construction. Any department that neglects to support the construction of mountain areas will affect the development of mountain area construction. Any department that does not pay attention to the work in mountain areas will be in danger of lagging behind. He said that he hopes that all departments will immediately attach importance to the work of supporting the construction of mountain areas, and avoid the phenomenon of disconnection.

Vice Chairman Zhu finally said that during the Second Five-Year Plan, the Central Committee regards the construction of mountain areas as one of the important tasks, and is prepared to support the construction of mountain areas with a large number of outstanding cadres. As long as all departments truly attach importance to the work in mountain areas, as long as the party and government leading organs at all levels truly rely on the broad masses, all the difficulties in building mountain areas can be overcome, and the socialist construction of mountain areas will surely develop rapidly, thereby greatly promoting the cause of national socialist construction.

### 朱德副主席在山区生产座谈会上作重要指示  全国支援山区  山区支援全国

    朱德副主席在山区生产座谈会上作重要指示
    全国支援山区  山区支援全国
    新华社28日讯　朱德副主席说：开发山区富源，建设山区，是全民的任务，也是全党的任务，必须全党动员起来，大家一起动手，把建设山区的工作做好。
    朱德副主席是在中共中央农村工作部召开的山区生产座谈会上提出这个要求的。他在这次会议上对山区建设工作做了重要指示。
    他说，山区同平原一样，在基本上完成了社会主义改造的基础上，几年来经济建设事业有了不小的发展，人民的生活得到了显著的改善。但是，同平原地区比较，山区人民生活还是困难的，山区的富源还没有大量地开发出来；山区工作中还存在着不少问题。最大的问题，就是许多地区许多同志，不重视山区工作。他们不懂得，如果不把山区的富源开发出来，我国的社会主义建设是有极大困难的。
    他说，山区建设为什么这样重要呢？这是因为山区占了全国土地面积的三分之二以上，人口、耕地和粮食产量都占三分之一左右；特别是因为山区有无穷的自然财富和宝藏，不仅地面上有山林竹木，山货药材等产品，而且地下有各种各样丰富的矿藏。因此，山区的生产潜力是十分巨大的。
    山区地广人稀，这同平原和沿海地区的地少人多正好相反。正因为这样，开发山区就可以大量地解决城市和平原地区多余人口的就业问题。
    朱副主席指出：由于山区的建设是这样的重要，所以中央把建设山区看作是第二、第三两个五年计划的重要工作之一，中央已经向全国人民和全体革命干部提出了“下乡上山”的号召。
    朱副主席说：山区经济的发展方针在全国农业发展纲要修正草案上已经做了原则指示。这就是：“按照因地制宜，实行多种经营的方针，发展山区的农业、林业、畜牧业和各种土特产的生产。”这个方针是完全正确的。
    接着，他着重地指示了山区建设的方向。他说：山区的建设方向应当是从山区的自给自足到全国经济的统一和全国经济交流；这个过程，也就是从全国支援山区建设到山区支援全国建设的过程。山区的建设开展起来了，那时候，山区的财富一定会源源不绝地开发出来，贡献给全国的建设事业。那样就会达到一个新时期，这就是山区支援全国的时期。这正是我们建设山区的远大目的。不看到这个光明的前景，以为党提出建设山区只是救急性的措施，这是完全错误的。朱副主席说，改善山区的交通运输，对于目前动员全国力量来支援山区的建设，对于今后利用山区的富源来支援全国的建设，都有异常重大的意义，因为只有这样，外边的东西才能运进去，山区的物资也才能运出来。当然，发展山区的交通运输，是一个长期的工作，所以当前山区还得采取许多自给自足的办法。这就是要尽力避免相向运输的浪费现象。为此，就需要在山区中大量发展小型工业和加工业，如酿酒、榨油、轧棉、碾米、磨粉、打蛋、制副食品、制药材以及其他可以就地取材的工业，甚至化学纤维工业等等。这样，一方面就地利用了山区的原料，同时又发展了山区的经济建设。所以大家要求“技术上山”，这是很对的。但是为了这个目的，也为了建设山区的远大目的，必须改善山区的交通运输。
    加强山区的商业工作，对发展山区生产有极大作用。朱副主席指出：在山区商业工作中，要特别注意发挥基层供销社的作用。因为山区村庄分散，生产规模小，专设国营商业机构是不合算的，应该使基层供销社担负外调、内销、收购、指导土特产生产的任务，结合农村手工业者和农村多余劳动力，进行产品的加工，自产自销。同时，还应该考虑把基层供销社和农业社、信贷社三位一体地结合起来，集中领导，分别经营。
    他说，山区的许多产品，不仅国内需要，而且是重要的出口物资。据对外贸易部统计，在现有的出口物资中，山区产品即占50％以上。由此可见，山区不仅在将来的社会主义建设中占据重要的地位，即在目前，对于支援出口，支援工业建设，向全国提供建筑材料、生活资料等方面，也是非常重要的。由此，就可以看出，改进山区商业工作，具有多么重大的国民经济意义。
    朱副主席强调指出：建设山区不仅是农业部门的任务，而且是工业、商业、财政、税收、文教、科学、卫生等各方面的共同任务，需要各部门在党委的统一领导下，共同协作。这是一个全民的任务，也是全党的任务，必须全党动员起来，大家一起动手，才能把山区生产建设做好。任何一个部门忽视支援山区建设工作，都会影响山区建设的发展。哪个部门不重视山区工作，哪个部门就会有落后的危险。他说，希望各部门都要立刻把支援山区建设的工作认真地重视起来，避免发生脱节的现象。
    朱副主席最后说，第二个五年计划期间，中央把建设山区作为重要工作之一，并准备以大批的优秀干部来支援山区建设。只要各部门真正把山区工作重视起来，只要各级党政领导机关真正依靠广大群众，建设山区的一切困难都是可以克服的，山区的社会主义建设，一定会迅速地发展起来，从而大大地促进全国社会主义建设事业。
