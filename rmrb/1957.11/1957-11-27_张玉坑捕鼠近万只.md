Zhang Yukeng, a farmer from Huli Village, Guanpo District, Zhao'an County, Fujian Province, caught a total of 9,955 rats, 520 sparrows, and 9.5 jin of flies in ten months from January this year, and also eliminated a large number of mosquitoes.

Zhang Yukeng's method of catching rats is mainly based on the living habits and regular movements of rats. In February this year, during the Lunar New Year, every household was steaming cakes and cooking rice cakes, so Zhang Yukeng seized this opportunity to go to various villages and households to catch rats. He also carried rat traps with him to various places, especially places where grain was stored, and caught a lot of rats. In addition to actively catching rats, Zhang Yukeng also promoted the significance of eliminating the "four pests" everywhere and introduced his catching experience.

    张玉坑捕鼠近万只
    福建省诏安县官陂区湖里村农民张玉坑，自今年1月起，十个月中，共捕到老鼠九千九百五十五只、麻雀五百二十只、苍蝇九斤半，并扑灭了大量的蚊子。
    张玉坑捕鼠的方法，主要是根据老鼠的生活习惯和出没规律，进行捕捉的。今年2月，正值旧历年关，家家户户蒸糕炊粿，张玉坑就抓住这个时机，到各村各户去捕老鼠；平时也带着捕鼠器，到各地特别是粮食贮藏的地方去捕捉，结果抓了很多老鼠。张玉坑除了积极捕鼠外，还到处宣传除“四害”的意义，介绍自己的捕捉经验。
