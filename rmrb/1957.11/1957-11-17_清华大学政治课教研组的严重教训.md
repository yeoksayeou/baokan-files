The Serious Lessons of the Political Theory Teaching and Research Group at Tsinghua University
Ai Zhisheng, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tsinghua University Committee

During this period of great blooming and contending, the Political Theory Teaching and Research Group at Tsinghua University, manipulated and incited by bourgeois right-wing elements, abandoned the ideological battleground of Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the Party's stance, and launched a frenzied attack on the Party. The Party organization within the teaching and research group also completely disintegrated.

The Political Theory Teaching and Research Group at Tsinghua University was established under the care and specific assistance of the Tsinghua Party Committee. The Party Committee has always attached great importance to the school's Marxist-Leninist theoretical courses. Why did the right-wing elements of the Political Theory Teaching and Research Group hate the Tsinghua Party Committee so much and attack it so madly? This is by no means accidental. For several years, the Party Committee has consistently adhered to the Party's correct teaching principle of "integrating theory with practice" and waged a resolute struggle against the bourgeois orientation within the teaching and research group, which aroused the hatred of the right-wing elements. For a long time, there has been a struggle between two lines, which finally developed into a sharp political and ideological class struggle during the rectification campaign. The main content of the right-wing's attack on the Party Committee was still opposing the Party's correct policy and demanding the abolition of the Party Committee's leadership over Marxist-Leninist teaching. They slandered the Party Committee's leadership over the teaching and research group as "the dogmatism cap pressing people so they can't lift their heads, and the experience wind blowing people so they can't stand firm."

Their anti-Party views on Marxist-Leninist theoretical education can be summarized in the following aspects:

First, negating ideological remolding and opposing the Party's "principle of integrating theory with practice." Right-wing elements attacked the past ideological remolding movement as "a movement, a gust of wind," believing that "using criticism to transform the thinking of young people creates unnecessary tension," believing that "focusing students' attention on overcoming individualism will hinder them from expanding their political horizons," and believing that the Party Committee wants to transform students' thinking through political courses is "moving old experiences of ideological remolding," which is "eager for quick success" and a "narrow utilitarian viewpoint" hoping for "instant results." They advocated: "Simply set up two teaching and research groups, one to teach Marxist-Leninist theory, to teach the articles, we only teach the articles, those who want the articles come to me; another teaching and research group to teach the communist outlook on life, let the Party Committee handle it, those who want to transform their thinking go there." In order to defend their view of negating ideological remolding, they put forward a series of absurd "theories" – "Theoretical courses mainly contact objective reality, transform the objective world, mainly not contact ideological reality, transform the subjective world." "Political theory courses solve fundamental ideological problems – worldviews, not solve specific ideological problems, solving specific ideological problems is the business of Party and Communist Youth League grassroots organizations." "Linking students' thinking with the study of teaching focus will destroy the scientific system and fragment Marxist-Leninist theory," and so on. Because they deny the fundamental purpose of political class – to transform thinking, they also deny themselves. During the period of blooming and contending, they took the lead in the whole school to advocate the abolition of Marxist-Leninist courses. They believe that Marxism-Leninism is not necessary for engineers. Engineers need Marxist-Leninist theory only in the same way that people need literary and artistic cultivation in their lives. They believe that the Ministry of Higher Education's stipulation of Marxist-Leninist compulsory courses is a clear example of imposing Marxism-Leninism on people and that political courses should be changed to elective courses.

Second, in teaching, they extremely despise the policies and resolutions formulated by the Party Central Committee and the works of responsible comrades. They call all these works that combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution "policies" and believe that they are not "theories." They believe that if lecturing is related to class struggle and the Party's policies and tasks, it is "confusing subjective initiative with objective law, that is, replacing theory with policy." They arrogantly said that political economy teachers should not only be interpreters of the Party's policies but should also participate in formulating the Party and state's policies.

In reality, how do they understand Marxist-Leninist theory? They openly told students: "Revolutionary history is just history and stories, with joy and sorrow; the foundation of Marxism-Leninism is ancient books, is the articles; political economy is pure theory, is abstract thinking, philosophy is training the brain." This is how they slander Marxist-Leninist theory.

Third, starting from bourgeois individualism, they despise and hate the Party's propaganda work and oppose participating in actual struggle and self-remolding. The Party Committee requires political theory teachers to also be Marxist-Leninist propagandists, but they are wholeheartedly yearning for empty "theoreticians" who are divorced from reality and divorced from the masses, and they never forget personal fame and gain, "academic status," and so on. Therefore, they slander the Party Committee for training "a batch of jack-of-all-trades cadres," "ignorant political windbags," emphasizing that "the professional labor of theoretical teachers is theoretical propaganda, which is different from general propaganda cadres, do not use us as general propaganda and education cadres." Therefore, they oppose participating in the Party's propaganda work, believing that this makes them "unable to sit down" and "unable to settle down to read," and even when the whole school suspended classes to study "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," the Party Committee called on political teachers to go deep into student classes, and some people openly opposed it. They believe that going to the countryside and factories during winter and summer vacations "hinders" theoretical research and scientific research, believing that "theoretical teachers should first pay attention to theoretical improvement." They advocated not going to the countryside during winter and summer vacations, doing as little social work as possible, studying current affairs and policies as little as possible, and concentrating all efforts on reading 12,000 pages of required reading for associate doctors. They especially hate ideological remolding. When it comes to teachers' self-remolding, they say "the Party Committee is putting pressure on us," "underestimating our level too much."

What is even more serious is that some teachers are actually obsessed with the path of bourgeois sociologists. Some of them were trained in social sciences in old universities, participated in some restoration activities of old sociology, often boasted about how useful old sociology was, and repeatedly stated that "We are not as good as the young in doing Marxism-Leninism, but we are good at doing the old." They agreed with Fei Xiaotong's "one room, two books," and "should also add a cup of tea and a cigarette."

Because this bourgeois individualistic plan has a sharp contradiction with the Party Committee's policy, they attacked the Party Committee in a big way during the period of great blooming and contending, and bourgeois individualism was rampant for a time.

Fourth, they despise the Party's organization and the Party's cadres, believing that the Party Committee does not understand Marxist-Leninist theory, and laymen cannot lead experts, demanding the abolition of the Party Committee's leadership over Marxist-Leninist theoretical education and advocating professor-led schools. Due to extreme individualistic arrogance and complete separation of theory and practice, they regard the Party Committee and the Party's cadres as "ignorant," "lacking research ability," and "lacking culture" "backward" groups. They especially emphasized that the Party Committee "simply does not understand what Marxist-Leninist theory is all about." They arrogantly believe that the Party Committee adheres to the correct policy and criticizes their mistakes not because of anything else, but because the Party Committee "does not understand" and is a "layman." The direct purpose of proposing "laymen cannot lead experts" is to overthrow the Party's leadership.

The fundamental reason for the occurrence of this incident is that the non-proletarian thinking of theoretical teachers has not been fundamentally transformed. Since 1956, the Party has called on intellectuals to march toward science, but they have used the Party's correct call to develop bourgeois individualistic thinking. They have adopted erroneous attitudes toward the relationship between politics and business, and the relationship between individuals and collectives. They thought that ideological remolding was almost done, and only reading books behind closed doors was the top priority. They only saw the individual's small world in their minds, and did not see the revolutionary collective. "They turned a deaf ear to things outside the window, and devoted themselves to getting a doctorate,"孜孜 pursuing personal fame and gain, competing for ranks, competing for wages, competing for further education opportunities, and competing for the priority of publishing pamphlets, making a lot of intrigue and blushing, but they were afraid of doing too much for teaching, students' ideological work, and self-remolding.

They doubted and wavered about the truth of Marxism-Leninism, the superiority of the socialist system, and the Party's leadership. Under the slogans of "opposing personal worship" and "advocating independent thinking," liberal anarchistic thinking was rampant for a time, Party discipline was lax, and rumors were everywhere, but it was praised as "active thinking."

The erroneous leadership of right-leaning opportunism is the decisive key to the occurrence of this incident. The Party Committee entrusted Yuan Yongxi (a right-wing element within the Party), the former first secretary of the Party Committee and a member of the current Party Committee Standing Committee, to be responsible for leading the work of the Political Theory Teaching and Research Group. However, Yuan Yongxi regarded this work as a "refuge" after he was "unsuccessful" in politics and treated Marxist-Leninist theoretical teaching work with a completely bourgeois individualistic attitude. He fully supported the bourgeois views of the Political Theory Teaching and Research Group and consistently supported the activities of the right-wing elements of the teaching and research group in action. He condoned the branch's resistance to the leadership of the Party Committee, reconciled at the Party Committee meeting, saying that "there are no issues of principle, mainly specific arrangements," and on the other hand, he encouraged the right-wing elements to say: "Compete, compete, what are you afraid of." The right-wing elements of the teaching and research group regarded him as a "protector" and the only person who could lead them. During this period of great blooming and contending, he repeatedly said: "The political class is well-released, basically healthy." Yuan Yongxi led the teaching and research group onto the dead end of anti-Party and anti-socialism.

From an organizational point of view, the serious impurity of the teaching staff is also an important reason for the occurrence of this incident. Among the right-wing elements of the political teaching and research group, some were old sociologists trained in old universities, bourgeois intellectuals whose thinking had not been fundamentally transformed. Some were class dissidents who had infiltrated the Party and the League. Their attacks on the Party were the most insidious and their methods were the most despicable. Some harbored resentment against the Party because they had political and historical problems or extremely complex social relations and took the opportunity to attack the Party. Some had extremely serious individualistic thoughts and were dissatisfied with the Party. Others had extremely reactionary thoughts or were seriously affected by revisionism, thus degenerating into right-wing elements.

The anti-Party incident of the political class teaching and research group fully shows that establishing a theoretical team that conducts Marxist-Leninist education in colleges and universities is a long-term and arduous task. This incident has given us serious and profound lessons.

First, we must resolutely implement our Party's correct policy of "studying theory, linking theory with practice, improving understanding, and transforming thinking" that has been effective for a long time, seriously and patiently criticize all erroneous thoughts that violate the Party's policy, and maintain and carry forward the valuable traditions in our Party's theoretical education work.

Second, it should be emphasized that educators must first be educated, and grasp the ideological remolding of theoretical teachers. In the training of theoretical teachers, in addition to the necessary theoretical preparation, the decisive link is self-remolding. For young intellectuals who lack practical struggle experience, special attention should be paid to combining them with workers and peasants and participating in certain practical work to transform their thinking and correct their positions in practical struggle and work.

Furthermore, organizationally, we must strictly pay attention to the political quality of theoretical teachers and maintain the purity of this team in terms of thought and organization. Under the glorious title of Marxist-Leninist teachers, the despicable activities carried out by bourgeois right-wing elements and bad elements with bad qualities will often cause inestimable losses to the Party's prestige and the Party's ties with the masses! We must seriously rectify the team of theoretical teachers and not allow right-wing elements and other bad elements to continue to tarnish the glorious title of Marxist-Leninist teachers.

Finally, and most importantly, theoretical education work must be carried out under the leadership and strict supervision of the Party Committee. The Party Committee must regard this team as an important assistant in its ideological work to guide it. This is the fundamental guarantee for completing the above tasks.

    清华大学政治课教研组的严重教训
    中共清华大学委员会副书记  艾知生
    这次大鸣大放期间，清华大学政治理论课教研组在资产阶级右派分子的操纵和煽动下，放弃了马列主义的思想阵地，背叛了党的立场，猖狂地向党进攻。教研组的党组织也全部瓦解。
    清华大学的政治理论课教研组是在清华党委关怀和具体帮助下建立起来的，党委对学校的马列主义理论课程一向予以极大的重视，为什么政治理论课教研组的右派分子还这样仇视清华党委，这样疯狂地向党委进攻呢？这决不是偶然的事情。几年来，党委始终坚持了党的“理论联系实际”的正确的教学方针，对教研组内的资产阶级方向进行了坚决的斗争，因此引起了右派的仇视。长期以来就存在着两条路线的斗争，到整风期间终于发展成为尖锐的政治上思想上的阶级斗争。右派对党委进攻的主要内容也还是反对党的正确方针和要求取消党委对于马列主义教学的领导。他们把党委对于教研组的领导诬蔑为“教条主义的帽子压的人抬不起头，经验之风吹的人站不住脚”。
    他们在马列主义理论教育问题上的反党观点可以归结为以下几个方面：
    第一、否定思想改造，反对党的“理论联系实际的方针”。右派分子攻击过去的思想改造运动是“一个运动一阵风”，认为“用批判的方式来改造青年的思想造成不必要的紧张”，认为“使学生的注意力集中在克服个人主义会妨碍他们扩大政治眼界，认为党委要通过政治课来改造学生的思想是“搬用思想改造的老经验”，是“急功近利”希望“立竿见影”的“狭隘实用观点”。他们主张：“干脆成立两个教研组，一个讲马列主义理论，讲条条，我们只讲条条，要条条的到我这里来；另一个教研组讲共产主义人生观，让党委来搞，要改造思想的到那儿去。”为了替他们否定思想改造的观点辩护，他们提出一系列荒谬的“理论”——“理论课主要是联系客观实际，改造客观世界，主要不是联系思想实际，改造主观世界。”“政治理论课是解决根本思想问题——世界观的，不是解决具体思想问题的，解决具体思想问题是党、团基层组织的事。”“联系学生的思想研究教学重点就要破坏科学体系，使马列主义理论支离破碎”，等等。由于他们否认政治课的根本目的——改造思想，他们也否定了自己。在鸣放期间，他们在全校首先倡议取消马列主义课程。他们认为马列主义之于工程师不是必需的，工程师需要马列主义理论，仅仅像人们生活中需要文学艺术修养一样。他们认为高教部规定马列主义必修课程是用马列主义强加于人的一个显明的例子，要把政治课改为选修。
    第二、在教学中，他们极端轻视党中央所制定的政策、决议和负责同志的著作，他们把这些马列主义普遍真理与中国革命实践相结合的著作一概名为“政策”，而认为都不是“理论”。他们认为如果联系阶级斗争和党的方针任务来讲课便是“把主观能动性与客观规律性混为一谈，就是以政策代替理论。”他们狂妄地说，政治经济学教员不应该只是党的政策解释者，而应该参与制定党和国家的政策。
    实际上，他们怎样了解马列主义理论呢？他们公开对学生讲：“革命史就是历史和故事，有欢乐有悲哀；马列主义基础是古书，是条条；政治经济学是纯理论，是抽象的思维，哲学是训练脑筋的。”他们就是这样来诽谤马克思列宁主义理论的。
    第三、从资产阶级个人主义出发，鄙视和厌恶党的宣传工作，反对参加实际斗争和自我改造。党委要求政治理论教员同时作一个马列主义的宣传员，但他们一心向往的是脱离实际脱离群众的空头“理论家”，念念不忘的是个人名利“学术地位”等等。因此诽谤党委要培养“一批万金油干部”，“不学无术的政治空谈家”，强调“理论教员的专业劳动是理论宣传，与一般的宣传干部不同，不要把我们当一般的宣教干部来使用。因此，他们反对参加党的宣传工作，认为这样使他们“坐不下来”“不能安下心来读书”，甚至在全校停课学习“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”时，党委号召政治教员深入学生班级，还有人公开反对。他们认为寒暑假下乡下厂“妨碍”钻研理论进行科学研究，认为“理论教员首先应该注意理论上的提高”。他们主张，不要寒暑假下乡，尽量少作社会工作，少学习时事政策，集中一切力量读完一万二千页的副博士必读书。他们特别厌恶思想改造，一提到教员的自我改造，便说“党委对我们施加压力”，“把我们的水平估计太低”。
    更严重的是一部分教员所迷恋的实际上是资产阶级社会学者的道路。他们中间有人是旧大学社会学科培养出来的，参予一些旧社会学复辟的活动，经常吹嘘旧社会学如何如何有用，一再声言“搞马列主义我们不如年青的，搞旧的还是我们行。”他们赞成费孝通的“一间房两本书”，“还应该加上一杯茶一支烟”。
    由于这种资产阶级个人主义的打算和党委的方针有着尖锐的矛盾，他们便在大鸣大放期间大肆攻击党委，资产阶级个人主义泛滥一时。
    第四、鄙视党的组织和党的干部，认为党委不懂马列主义理论，外行不能领导内行，要求取消党委对于马列主义理论教育的领导，主张教授治校。由于极端个人主义的狂妄自大和完全割裂理论与实践，他们把党委和党的干部看成是“不学无术”，“没有研究能力”，“没有文化”的“落后”的集团。他们尤其强调党委“根本不懂马列主义理论是怎么一回事”，他们狂妄地认为党委坚持正确的方针批判他们的错误不是因为别的，就是因为党委“不懂”“外行”。提出“外行不能领导内行”的直接目的就是要推翻党的领导。
    理论教员的非无产阶级思想没有得到根本的改造是发生这一事件的根本原因。1956年以来，党号召知识分子向科学进军，他们却利用党的正确的号召发展了资产阶级个人主义思想。他们对政治和业务的关系、个人和集体的关系都采取了错误的态度。自以为思想改造得差不多了，只有闭门读书才是当务之急。心目中只看到个人的小天地，看不到革命的集体。“两耳不闻窗外事，一心为了副博士”，孜孜追求个人名利，争级别，争工资，争进修机会，争出版小册子的优先权，闹的勾心斗角，面红耳赤，对于教学工作、学生的思想工作、自我改造则唯恐多做了。
    他们对马列主义真理、社会主义制度的优越性和党的领导产生了怀疑和动摇，在“反对个人崇拜”“提倡独立思考”的口号下，自由主义无政府主义思想猖獗一时，党内纪律松懈，到处流言蜚语，却美其名曰“思想活跃”。
    右倾机会主义的错误领导是发生这次事件的决定性关键。党委委托前党委第一书记、本届党委常委袁永熙（党内右派分子）负责领导政治理论教研组的工作。袁永熙却把这个工作看成他在政治上“不得志”后的“避难所”，完全以资产阶级个人主义的态度来对待马列主义理论教学工作，他完全支持政治理论教研组的资产阶级观点，在行动上也一贯支持教研组右派的活动。他纵容支部抗拒党委的领导，一面在党委会上进行调和，说什么“没有原则问题，主要是具体安排”，另一方面怂恿右派分子说：“争就争，怕什么”。教研组的右派把他看成“保护者”和唯一能领导他们的人。在这次大鸣大放期间，他一再说：“政治课放的好，基本健康”。袁永熙把教研组引上了反党反社会主义的绝路。
    从组织上看，教员队伍的严重不纯也是发生这次事件的重要原因。在政治教研组的右派分子中，有的是旧大学培养出来的旧社会学者，思想未经根本改造的资产阶级知识分子。有的是混入党内团内的阶级异己分子，他们向党进攻用心最为阴险，手法最为卑劣。有的是因本人有政治历史问题或社会关系极为复杂，对党怀恨在心，乘机向党进攻。有的是有极严重的个人主义思想，对党不满。还有的是思想极为反动或受修正主义影响十分严重，因而堕落为右派分子。
    这次政治课教研组的反党事件，充分说明了在高等学校中建立进行马列主义教育的理论队伍，是一个长期而艰巨的任务。这次事件给了我们严重而深刻的教训。
    首先，必须坚决贯彻我党长期行之有效的“学习理论，联系实际，提高认识，改造思想”的正确方针，严肃而耐心地批判一切违背党的方针的错误思想，保持和发扬我党的理论教育工作中的宝贵传统。
    其次，应该强调教育者必须先受教育，抓紧理论教员的思想改造。理论教员的培养，除了必要的理论准备以外，决定性的一环是自我改造。对于缺乏实际斗争锻炼的青年知识分子，尤其应该注意使他们和工农群众结合，参加一定的实际工作，在实际斗争中和工作中改造思想，端正立场。
    又其次，在组织上必须严格注意理论教员的政治质量，保持这支队伍在思想上和组织上的纯洁性。在马列主义教员的光荣称号下面，资产阶级右派分子和品质恶劣的坏分子所进行的卑劣活动，往往会给党的威信、党和群众的联系造成不可估计的损失！我们必须严肃地整顿理论教员的队伍，不让右派分子和其他坏分子继续玷污马列主义教员的光荣称号。
    最后，也是最重要的，必须使理论教育工作在党委的领导和严格监督下进行，党委必须把这支队伍当作自己在思想工作方面的重要助手来加以引导，这是完成上述各项任务的根本保证。
