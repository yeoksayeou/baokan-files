The top ten fertilizer sources, every one is a treasure
Chen Shangjin Chenxi

    Pig manure
    According to the experience of farmers in various places, raising one pig can generally fertilize two or three mu of land. There are now more than 110 million pigs in the country. If the manure is fully utilized, it can fertilize 200 to 300 million mu of land. It is not wrong to say that the fertilizer accumulated by one pig in a year can increase grain production by 200 to 300 jin. Local experience: Generally, a pig raised from small to about 150 jin can accumulate about 40 dan of pure manure if water manure is used, and its fertilizer effect is equivalent to 60 jin of ammonium sulfate; using crop stalks as bedding can accumulate about 60 dan of pigpen manure; in the southern mountainous areas, using weeds or sod to pad the pen can accumulate about 100 dan of pig manure. In North China, using soil to pad the pen can accumulate 15,000 jin of soil manure; but if the pigs run wild, only 8 dan of pig manure can be collected in a year. Raising pigs must have pens. In the northern pigpens, it is also necessary to advocate frequent soil padding and soil changing to absorb urine and preserve nitrogen; in the southern regions, pigpens should also be cleaned regularly, and attention should be paid to shading, covering, and leak prevention.
    Draft animal manure
    Each draft animal excretes about 15,000 jin of manure per year, and after being accumulated into compost or soil manure, it can generally fertilize about 10 mu of land, which is generally given more attention in various places. However, a few areas, such as northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and central Guangdong, believe that cattle manure is not effective and will cause grass to grow in the fields. According to scientific analysis, 1,000 jin of cow manure contains 3 jin of nitrogen, 2 jin of phosphoric acid, and 1 jin of potassium oxide. As long as it is fully fermented, it is a very good fertilizer.
    Sheep manure has a very high fertilizer content. Before the establishment of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Laiyuan County, Hebei Province, there were 750 sheep raised in the whole township, and the area fertilized with sheep manure was 1,080 mu. Each mu was fertilized with 2,500 jin, and the yield of corn per mu was 245 jin. After the establishment of the cooperative in 1955, the number of sheep increased to 1,500, the area fertilized with sheep manure expanded to 1,800 mu, the amount applied per mu increased to 3,000 jin, and the yield of corn per mu reached 350 jin.
    Human excrement
    Human excrement has a high fertilizer content and a quick fertilizer effect. In the southern countryside, it is known as "fine fertilizer" and is mostly used carefully. In recent years, the accumulation of urine to water wheat and uncultivated land has gradually increased in the north. However, some farmers in some areas do not pay attention to it, fearing dirt, odor, and trouble, and do not use either or only use human feces while ignoring human urine. In some places, due to poor fertilizer preservation, human urine is stored in the open air, and nitrogen is lost, resulting in great waste. Methods for preserving human urine:
    ① When storing human feces and urine in a mixed manner, dung tanks, dung pits, dung wells, dung cellars, etc. must be shaded, covered, and leak-proof. For example, the tile urn-style toilet ponds in Mengjin County, Henan Province, are deep, wide in the middle, and narrow at the mouth, with a large storage capacity and a small contact surface with the air, strong fertilizer retention, and fast fermentation. More than 450,000 have been promoted in Henan.
    ② In areas where soil fertilizer is applied, soil can be used to preserve and absorb fertilizer. Three to four times the amount of soil is preferred. Although more soil can still retain fertilizer, it is too wasteful of labor.
    Green manure
    Farmers in many areas of our country have a habit of using winter fallow land and wasteland to plant green manure. One thousand jin of green manure can increase rice production by about 50 to 60 jin that year and can also improve the soil. Since liberation, various provinces have summarized and promoted various methods for developing green manure based on local conditions. In addition to using winter fallow land to plant purple alfalfa, Sichuan, Guangdong, and other provinces use autumn fallow land after harvesting mid-season rice, or short-term fallow land between early and late rice, to plant dense hyacinth beans, vetch, and sesbania; Shanxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces use wheat fallow land in one-season winter wheat areas to plant mung beans; Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, and other provinces use the rows of tall-stem crops (such as sorghum), sugarcane, fruit trees, tea trees, and mulberry trees to plant beans for fertilizer. In addition, the unit yield of green manure is very uneven. Some areas only harvest 500 to 600 jin per mu, while high-yield areas can harvest 4,000 to 5,000 jin per mu, or even more than 10,000 jin, a difference of ten times. Increasing the unit yield of green manure has great potential for increasing fertilizer.
    Composting
    The masses in various places have very good composting habits, such as the grass pond mud in Jiangsu, the cellar fertilizer in Jiangxi, and the ? fertilizer in Hunan, etc. In recent years, it has become the main content of fertilizer accumulation. According to the comparative test results of Pingdong Farm in Shandong Province, 2,000 jin of grass fertilizer per mu yielded 165 jin of wheat, which is similar to the effect of soil manure. There are a lot of green mountains, fallen leaves, weeds, garbage, and straw stalks in various places, which are good raw materials for making compost.
    Wood ash
    In addition to potassium, wood ash also contains lime and phosphate, which is very effective when applied to peanut, soybean, and sweet potato fields.
    Farmers in some areas are accustomed to storing wood ash together with human feces, urine, and compost, which is a very bad method, because wood ash is alkaline and will cause nitrogen to evaporate and be lost when mixed with human and animal feces and urine. Therefore, wood ash should be stored separately, and losses caused by wind and rain should be prevented.
    Mud fertilizer
    River and pond mud, sea mud, kang soil, smoked soil, house soil, wall soil, nitrate soil, street soil, etc. all contain certain fertilizer components. Coastal, lakeside, and rural ponds have a lot of rotten animals and plants and fertile soil washed down due to the growth of aquatic plants and the breeding of aquatic birds and fish every year, which is a very good source of fertilizer; kang soil and smoked soil not only absorb ammonia from black smoke, increasing fertilizer content, but also decompose most of the soil nutrients into fast-acting properties that are easily utilized by crops during the smoking process; house soil, wall soil, nitrate soil, etc. are very rich in nitrates. The longer the age, the higher the fertilizer content, four to five times higher than general soil, and some even have a higher fast-acting fertilizer content than soil manure. Therefore, the masses say, "Home soil is a tiger in the ground," and "It's hard to buy smoked soil with money."
    Sea fertilizer
    Sea fertilizer mainly includes marine animals and plants and waste products from coastal fishing processing plants. Such as seabird guano, snails, seaweed, and other things from the Guangdong area. Several dozens such as sea clams and sea sand from the Shandong coastal area are very good fertilizers. Coastal farmers have a habit of using them. The yield increase effect of sea fertilizer is also very significant. Shangpeng Cooperative in Raoping County, Shandong Province, used sea clams as fertilizer, and sweet potatoes had a large-scale bumper harvest, with an average yield of 7,200 jin per mu.
    Peat
    In recent years, a lot of peat has been discovered throughout the country. Highly decomposed peat with low acidity can be directly used as a base fertilizer. Poorly decomposed peat should be stacked and fermented with compost and human excrement or applied after padding the pen. Peat with excessive acidity should also be added with lime. It is most effective when applied to crops such as sweet potatoes and peanuts.
    Lime
    Lime is a very important fertilizer and should be prepared as early as winter. Lime should be used more carefully in acidic red and yellow soils and in fields where green manure has been applied. Shells, eggshells, chalk, etc. have the same effect as lime. (Attached picture)

    十大肥源　样样是宝
    陈尚谨　陈西
    猪粪尿
    根据各地农民经验，养一头猪，一般可肥田二、三亩。全国现有一亿一千多万头猪，如果把粪尿充分利用起来，就可肥田两三亿亩。一头猪一年所积的肥料可增产粮食二、三百斤。这话一点也不错。各地经验：一般一头猪从小养到一百五十斤左右，使用水粪的可积到四十担上下的纯粪尿，它的肥效即相当于六十斤硫酸铵；用作物秆作褥草的可积到六十担左右的猪厩肥；南方山区用杂草或草皮垫栏，可积一百担左右的猪栏粪。华北用土垫圈，可积一万五千斤的土粪；但是如果养跑猪，一年就只能拣到八担猪粪。养猪一定要有栏圈。北方猪圈还要提倡经常垫土，换土，吸收尿汁，保存氮素；南方地区猪圈也要经常打扫，注意遮阴、加盖、和防漏。
    耕畜粪尿
    每头耕畜每年排泄粪尿约一万五千斤，积制成厩肥或土粪后一般可肥田十亩左右，各地一般比较重视。但也有少数地区如苏北、淮北、粤中等地认为牛粪肥效不好，落田还会生草。根据科学的分析，一千斤牛粪中有氮素三斤，硷酸二斤，氧化钾一斤，只要经过充分酸酵腐熟就是很好的肥料。
    羊粪尿的肥分很高，河北涞源县红星农业社在未建社时全乡养羊七百五十头，施用羊粪的面积一千零八十亩，每亩施用二千五百斤，亩产玉米二百四十五斤。1955年建社后，羊增加到一千五百头，施用羊粪面积扩大到一千八百亩，每亩施用量提高到三千斤，亩产玉米达三百五十斤。
    人粪尿
    人粪尿肥分高，肥效快，在南方农村里有细肥之称，大多很注意利用。北方近年来积尿浇麦和浇白地的也逐渐增多。但是有些地区农民还不重视，怕脏，怕臭，怕麻烦，两项都不利用或只利用人粪而忽视人尿。有些地方由于保肥不善，人尿露天贮存，氮素丢失，都造成很大浪费。人尿的保存办法：
    ①人粪尿混合贮存时，粪缸、粪坑、粪井、粪窖等都要遮阴、加盖、防漏。如河南孟津县的瓦瓮式茅池，池深、腰宽、口窄，贮存量大，同空气接触面很小，保肥强，腐熟快。目前在河南已推广四十五万多个。
    ②施土粪地区可以用土来保存吸收肥分，用土以三到四倍为好，土再加多，虽仍可保肥，但太浪费劳力。
    绿肥
    我国很多地区农民向有利用冬闲田及荒坡隙地种植绿肥的习惯，一千斤绿肥当年约可增产五、六十斤稻谷，还可以改良土壤。解放以来，各省因地制宜的总结推广了各种各样的发展绿肥办法，除利用冬闲田种植紫云英等外，四川、广东等省利用中稻收后的秋闲田，或早、晚稻间的短期休间田种植密葫豆子、苕子、田菁等；山西、陕西等省在一季冬麦地区利用麦闲田种植绿豆；安徽、浙江、湖南等省利用高秆作物（如高粱）、甘蔗、果树、茶树、桑树行间种植豆类翻作肥料。另外，绿肥单位产量很不平衡，有些地区每亩只收五、六百斤，高产的每亩可收四、五千斤，甚至有万斤以上的，相差十倍。提高绿肥单位产量增加肥料的潜力极大。
    堆肥沤肥
    各地群众素有很好的堆肥沤肥习惯，如江苏的草塘泥，江西的窖肥，湖南的?肥等等，近年来已成为积肥的主要内容。据山东省平东农场对比试验结果，用草肥二千斤的亩产小麦一百六十五斤与土粪肥效相近，各地山青、落叶、杂草、垃圾、藁秆等非常多，都是制作堆肥的好原料。
    草木灰
    草木灰所含成份除钾素外，还含有石灰和磷酸，施用在花生、大豆和甘薯地里效果很好。
    有些地区的农民习惯把草木灰和人粪尿、厩肥等混合贮存，这种办法很不好，因为草木灰带有碱性和人畜粪尿混在一起会使其中氮素挥发损失。所以草木灰要单独存放，同时还要防止风吹雨淋遭致损失。
    泥土肥
    河塘泥、海泥、炕土、熏土、房土、墙土、硝土、街土等都含有一定的肥分。沿海，滨湖靠河及农村池塘因每年水草滋生，饲养水禽、鱼类、水底淤积很多腐烂的动植物及冲刷下来的肥土，是很好的肥源；炕土、熏土除吸收了黑烟中的氨，增加了肥分外，熏烧过程中土壤养分大多分解成为容易被作物利用的速效性质；房土，墙土，硝土等含硝酸盐类很丰富，年代愈久肥分愈高，比一般土壤高四、五倍，有的所含速效肥分甚至比土粪还要高。所以群众说“家里土，地里虎”，“有钱难买熏烧土”。
    海肥
    海肥主要包括海生动植物与沿海渔业加工厂中的废弃品。如广东一带的海鸟粪、螺仔、海草、花圭鱼、花子螺等。山东沿海一带的海蛤、海沙子等数十种都是很好的肥料。沿海农民已有施用习惯。施用海肥增产效果也很显著，山东饶平县上蓬社施用海蛤作肥料，甘薯大面积丰收，平均亩产七千二百斤。
    草炭
    近年来全国各地发现草炭很多。高度分解和酸度不大的草炭，可以直接用作基肥。分解度较差的草炭，应先与厩肥、人粪尿堆积发酵或垫圈后施用。酸度过高的草炭还要加入石灰。施用于甘薯、花生等作物，肥效最为显著。
    石灰
    石灰是很重要的肥料，要在冬季及早准备。在酸性较高的红壤、黄壤上，施用过绿肥的田地里，更要注意施用石灰。蚌壳、蛋皮、白垩土等也和石灰有同样的作用。（附图片）
