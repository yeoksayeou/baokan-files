    The October Revolution Opened a New Era in International Relations
    Qiao Guanhua
    (IV)
    The Second World War defeated the three imperialist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan. A series of socialist countries and nationalist countries emerged in Europe and Asia. As a result of the Second World War, the Soviet Union was not weakened, but became stronger. However, the American imperialist aggressive clique, which made a fortune in the Second World War, in order to seize the maximum profit, establish world hegemony, and suppress the people's movement and national independence movements in various countries, re-launched the evil activities against the Soviet Union, other socialist countries, and all peace-loving countries and peoples.
    Not long after the end of the war, the American aggressive clique, colluding with the British and French ruling cliques, pursued the "position of strength" policy that threatened world peace and security, and embarked on the road of arms expansion and war preparation. They tried every means to revive German and Japanese militarism, attempting to use the rearmed West Germany and Japan as their main bases and pawns for launching a new war. They organized the aggressive North Atlantic military bloc in the West. This military bloc was a direct challenge to the Soviet Union and the socialist countries of Eastern Europe.
    After the American imperialism suffered a shameful defeat on the Chinese mainland, it provoked a war of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and occupied China's territory of Taiwan; it supported and tried to expand the war of the French colonialists' aggression against Indochina. After Korea, Vietnam, the Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving countries jointly worked to stop the wars in Korea and Indochina, the American aggressive clique organized the Manila military bloc in the East, with its spearhead pointing at China and peace-loving Asian countries.
    In the Near and Middle East, the imperialist aggressive clique organized the Baghdad military bloc. Taking advantage of the failure of the British and French aggression against Egypt, American imperialism openly put forward the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in an attempt to replace Britain and France in the Near and Middle East, suppress the Arab national independence movement, and make the entire Near and Middle East a colony and sphere of influence of the United States.
    Through these aggressive military blocs and other various bilateral agreements, American imperialism has filled the periphery of socialist countries with military bases; through the military "aid" of the "Mutual Security Act," it has driven dozens of countries, large and small, to expand their armaments and provide cannon fodder. They openly use atomic blackmail, relying on the "deterrent power of massive retaliation" and "brinkmanship" policies to promote their imperialist aggressive policies. This is the main root of the tense international situation after the war.
    Faced with the war threats of the imperialist aggressive clique, the Soviet Union, as the world peace fortress, held high the banner of peace and unswervingly struggled to prevent new wars, ease international tensions, and achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The Soviet Union's efforts and initiatives in reducing armaments, banning atomic weapons, and establishing a European collective security system, in improving relations between major powers, and in expanding international contact and links in all aspects have been supported by all socialist countries, all peace-loving countries, and the broad masses of the world's people, and have made great contributions to maintaining world peace and international security.
    Due to the heroic struggle of the people of all countries suffering from imperialist aggression and subversion, and due to the vigorous support of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, the aggressive fires lit by imperialism in various parts of the world have been extinguished one by one. The American aggressors who launched the Korean War were forced to stop at the 38th parallel. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, Western countries were forced to reach an agreement on the ceasefire in Indochina. The counter-revolutionary riots instigated by imperialist reactionary forces in Hungary were resolutely attacked and had to withdraw their claws. The British and French aggressors' military adventures against Egypt were met with the heroic resistance of the Egyptian people and the firm opposition of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, and quickly declared bankruptcy. The peace forces headed by the Soviet Union have gained more and more advantages in the constant contest and repeated struggle with the war forces headed by American imperialism. This has meant that although the international situation has repeatedly been tense in recent years, the general trend is still towards relaxation.
    However, the American aggressive clique is by no means reconciled to this. The relaxation of the international situation will lead more Asian and African countries to take the road of peaceful neutrality, promote the development of the neutral trend and centrifugal tendencies in Western countries, and hinder the implementation of its policy of arms expansion and war preparation. This is not in line with the interests of the American aggressive clique. Therefore, they constantly create tension at different times and in different regions, and even do not hesitate to take military provocative actions. At present, the American imperialism's sinister plot to instigate Turkey to invade Syria can just illustrate this point. Here, as elsewhere, it is the Soviet Union that has held high the banner of justice against aggression, taking the lead in encouraging and supporting the independent struggle of the Syrian people and all Arab countries and peoples. All oppressed countries and nations can clearly see that the Soviet Union and the socialist countries closely united with the Soviet Union are their most reliable and most loyal friends.
    As long as imperialism exists for one day, and the economic foundation for the outbreak of war also exists for one day, the imperialist reactionary forces representing the interests of the big monopoly capital will inevitably attempt to expand and aggress abroad, carry out military adventures, and launch wars. This is a truth that has been repeatedly confirmed by the international life of the past forty years since the October Revolution.
    However, today's international situation is very different from that before the Second World War. At that time, the socialist Soviet Union was just an isolated island in the ocean of capitalist countries, and the vast colonies and semi-colonies were actually the rear of imperialism. Now, one socialist country has become a socialist world spanning Europe and Asia. This world is united, prosperous, and demonstrates its superiority in all aspects; this socialist superiority is even more powerfully proved by the Soviet Union's mastery of intercontinental missiles and the launching of artificial satellites. And those colonial countries that used to be the great rear of imperialism have either embarked on the socialist road, or have embarked on or are embarking on the nationalist road of independent development. These peace-loving, anti-war Asian and African nationalist countries and the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union have formed a vast peace area with a population of 1.5 billion. At the same time, the broad masses of the world's people do not want war, and the peace movement, in which increasingly broad strata of people from all countries in the world participate, has become a huge force in contemporary international life. All this shows that the peace forces in the world now outweigh the war forces, and as long as the peace-loving countries and peoples unite and persist in struggle, war can be completely prevented.
    Of course, we should estimate the madness of all doomed classes and maintain a high degree of vigilance. However, if the imperialists must launch a third world war, then, as Comrade Khrushchev has repeatedly pointed out, "The Third World War can only end with the collapse of capitalism."
    Forty years since the October Revolution. The development of the world situation over the past forty years has fully proved that the great cause of peace, democracy, and socialism of mankind is bound to win, and no force can stop it. Long live the great October Socialist Revolution! (The End)

    十月革命开辟了国际关系中的新纪元
    乔冠华
    （四）
    第二次世界大战打垮了德、意、日三个帝国主义国家，在欧亚两洲出现了一系列的社会主义国家和民族主义国家；作为第二次世界大战的结果，苏联不是削弱，而是更加强大了。但是，在第二次世界大战中发了横财的美帝国主义侵略集团，为了攫取最大限度的利润，建立世界霸权、镇压各国人民运动和民族独立运动，却重新展开了反对苏联、其他社会主义国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的罪恶活动。
    美国侵略集团在战争结束后不久，就伙同英法统治集团，推行威胁世界和平和安全的“实力地位”政策，走上了扩军备战的道路。他们千方百计地复活德、日军国主义，企图把重新武装的西德和日本，作为他们发动新战争的主要基地和打手。他们在西方组织了侵略性的北大西洋军事集团。这个军事集团是对苏联和东欧社会主义国家的直接挑战。
    美帝国主义在中国大陆上遭到可耻的失败之后，挑起了侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争，并且侵占了中国的领土台湾；它支持并且力图扩大法国殖民主义者侵略印度支那的战争。在朝鲜、越南、苏联、中国和其他爱好和平的国家共同努力制止了朝鲜和印度支那的战争之后，美国侵略集团又在东方组织了矛头指向中国和爱好和平的亚洲国家的马尼拉军事集团。
    在中近东，帝国主义侵略集团组织了巴格达军事集团。美国帝国主义趁英法侵埃失败的机会，公开提出了“艾森豪威尔主义”企图取英法在中近东的地位而代之，镇压阿拉伯的民族独立运动，使整个中近东地区成为美国的殖民地和势力范围。
    美帝国主义通过这些侵略性的军事集团和其他各种双边协定在社会主义国家的周围布满了军事基地；通过“共同安全法”的军事“援助”，驱使大大小小几十个国家扩充军备，提供炮灰。他们公开使用原子讹诈、依靠“大规模报复的威慑力量”和“战争边缘”政策来推行他们的帝国主义侵略政策。这是造成战后国际紧张局势的主要根源。
    面对着帝国主义侵略集团的战争威胁，作为世界和平堡垒的苏联高举起和平的旗帜，坚持不懈地为防止新的战争、缓和国际紧张局势、实现社会制度不同国家的和平共处而斗争。苏联在裁减军备、禁止原子武器和建立欧洲集体安全制度方面，在改善大国之间的关系和扩大各方面的国际接触和联系方面所进行的努力和倡议，得到了所有社会主义国家、所有爱好和平的国家和世界广大人民的拥护和支持，对维护世界和平和国际安全作出了伟大的贡献。
    由于遭受帝国主义侵略和颠覆的各国人民的英勇斗争，由于以苏联为首的社会主义各国和其他爱好和平的国家的大力支援，帝国主义在世界各地点起来的侵略火头一个个地被扑灭了。发动朝鲜战争的美国侵略者被迫在三八线上停了下来。经过奠边府的战役，西方国家被迫达成关于印度支那停战的协议。帝国主义反动势力在匈牙利策动的反革命暴乱遭到坚决的攻击，不得不缩回他们的魔手。英法侵略者对埃及的军事冒险遭到埃及人民的英勇抵抗和苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的坚决反对，很快就宣告破产。以苏联为首的和平力量在同以美帝国主义为首的战争势力所进行的不断较量和反复斗争中，取得了越来越大的优势。这就使得国际形势在最近几年来虽然一再出现紧张的局面，总的趋势却仍是走向缓和。
    但是，美国侵略集团是决不甘心的。国际局势的缓和将使更多的亚非国家走上和平中立的道路，促进西方国家的中立趋势和离心倾向的发展，妨碍它的扩军备战政策的执行。这是同美国侵略集团的利益不相符合的。因此，他们在不同时期和不同地区不断制造紧张，甚至不惜采取军事挑衅的行动。目前，美国帝国主义唆使土耳其侵略叙利亚罪恶阴谋，正可以说明这一点。在这里，像在其他地方一样，是苏联高举起反侵略的正义旗帜，带头鼓舞和支持了叙利亚人民和所有阿拉伯国家和人民的独立斗争。所有被压迫的国家和民族都可以清楚地看到，苏联以及同苏联紧密团结在一起的社会主义国家是他们最可靠最忠实的朋友。
    只要帝国主义还存在一天，发生战争的经济基础也存在一天，代表大独占资本利益的帝国主义反动势力必然企图对外扩张侵略，进行军事冒险和发动战争。这是十月革命后四十年来的国际生活所一再证实的真理。
    但是，今天的国际形势已经大大地不同于第二次世界大战以前的形势了。那时，社会主义的苏联只是资本主义国家海洋中的一个孤岛，而广大的殖民地和半殖民地实际上还是帝国主义的后方。现在，一个社会主义国家已经变成一个横跨欧亚两洲的社会主义世界。这个世界团结一致，欣欣向荣，从一切方面表现出它的优越性；这种社会主义的优越性更从苏联掌握洲际导弹和发射人造卫星得到更加有力的证明。而那些过去曾经是帝国主义大后方的殖民地国家，不是已经走上社会主义的道路，就是已经走上或者正在走上独立发展的民族主义的道路。这些爱好和平、反对战争的亚非民族主义国家同以苏联为首的社会主义国家已经形成了一个拥有十五亿人口的广大和平地区。同时，世界广大人民是不要战争的，有世界各国越来越广泛的各阶层人士参加和平运动，已经成为当代国际生活中一支巨大力量。所有这一切说明，现在世界上的和平力量已经超过了战争力量，只要爱好和平的国家和人民团结一致，坚持斗争，战争是完全可以阻止的。
    当然，应当估计到一切命定死亡的阶级的疯狂性，并保持高度的警惕。但是，如果帝国主义者一定要发动第三次世界大战，那么，正如赫鲁晓夫同志所一再指出的，“第三次世界大战只能是以资本主义崩溃而告终”。
    十月革命四十年了。四十年来天下大势的发展充分证明了，人类的和平、民主和社会主义的伟大事业是一定要胜利的，是没有任何力量阻挡得住的。伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！　（续完）
