    Sports Activities in a Township

    Sports activities in Xiangshan Township in the western suburbs of Beijing only began after the high tide of agricultural cooperativization.

    During the slack farming season, under the leadership and support of the township's Communist Youth League organization, various sports activities unfolded in Xiangshan Township. Both of Xiangshan Township's cooperatives—Xiangshan Cooperative and Yuxiang Cooperative—have basketball teams. Every day as the sun sets, people are always playing basketball on the court, with a group of people waiting outside, taking turns in shifts. These two teams often compete with soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and students. These young men play very well, and even those well-trained soldiers sometimes lose to them. At last year's sports meet held in Haidian District, the Xiangshan Cooperative's basketball team won the championship.

    Long-distance running, this activity is even more convenient in the countryside. On those roads extending in all directions, you can run wherever you want and run as far as you want. Twenty or thirty young people from Yuxiang Cooperative organized an exercise group. Every morning they run from Xiangshan along the road to the Temple of the Sleeping Buddha, and then run back. They persist in running regardless of the weather. Running three or four thousand meters every day, although not much, is very effective over time. The young people participating in the exercise all say, "When working, my legs have more strength."

    Tug-of-war, grenade throwing, high jump, long jump and other activities are also popular. Whenever they have free time, a group of young people run together, find a rope, and compete against each other. They are all people who work hard, so it is interesting to see who is stronger. Which child in the countryside hasn't thrown stones or tiles? As soon as they see grenade throwing, they all want to try their hand.

    Projects suitable for farmers' activities are developed particularly quickly, and many people participate. Under the influence of the young men, the young women in the township also participate in sports activities. On the basketball court, they can also grab the ball with the young men. They also love to play grenade throwing and tug-of-war.

    Sports activities in Xiangshan Township are developing well, but they don't spend much money on them. In terms of venues and equipment, they borrow as much as possible and use substitutes as much as possible. In more than two years, they only built one basketball court. They can use the five basketball courts of nearby units in their spare time, which is practically equivalent to having six courts. A wide and flat threshing ground in Hongmen Village in the township has become their track and field. There, dozens of people can do tug-of-war and throw grenades at the same time without any problem. Last year, the young people in the cooperative earned more than 300 yuan through voluntary labor. They plan to use part of this money for sports activities, so they don't have to use the cooperative's money.

    Sports activities in Xiangshan Township have been launched, but this is only the beginning, and it is necessary to strive for more people to participate in various activities. (Zhu Wen)

    一个乡的体育活动
    北京西郊香山乡的体育活动是农业合作化高潮后，才开展起来的。
    农闲时节，在乡的团组织的领导和支持下，好多种运动项目在香山乡展开了。香山乡的两个社——香山社和玉香社都有篮球队。每当日薄西山，篮球场上总是有人在玩球，场外还围有一群人等着，他们分班轮流打。这两个球队经常同解放军战士们、学生们比赛。这些小伙子们打的很不坏，连那些锻炼有素的战士们有时还输给了他们。在去年海淀区举行的运动会上，香山社的篮球队得了冠军。
    长跑，这项活动在农村更是方便。在那四通八达的公路上，愿往那跑，愿跑多远，都随你的便。玉香社的二、三十个青年，组织了一个锻炼小组，他们每天清晨从香山沿着公路跑到卧佛寺，再跑回来。无论什么天气他们都坚持跑下来。每天跑三、四千公尺，虽不算多，日子久了很见效。参加锻炼的青年们都说，“干起活来，腿上更有劲了。”
    拔河、手榴弹掷远、跳高、跳远等活动，爱玩的人也不少。一有空，一群青年们就跑到一起，找条绳子分两边比试比试。都是出力气干活的人，较量一下谁有劲是很有趣的事。农村的小孩子谁没有扔过石子、瓦片，一看见掷手榴弹，都想来试一下身手。
    适合农民活动的项目，开展起来特别快，参加的人也多。乡里的年轻姑娘们在小伙子们的带动下，也参加了体育活动。在篮球场上，她们同样地能和男青年们抢球。手榴弹和拔河她们也都很爱玩。
    香山乡的体育活动开展得不错，可是他们花在这方面的钱并不多。在场地和器械方面，他们尽量能借用的借用，能代用的代用。两年多，他们只修了一个篮球场。附近其它单位的五个篮球场，在空闲时他们都可以利用，实际上等于他们有六个球场。乡里红门村的一个宽广平坦的打麦场成了他们的田径场。在那里，几十个人同时拔河、掷手榴弹都毫无问题。去年，社里青年们义务劳动得了三百多元。这笔钱他们准备拿出一部分来用在体育活动上，这样就可以不动用社里的钱了。
    香山乡的体育活动开展了，但这还只是开始，需要争取更多的人参加各项活动。　（朱文）
