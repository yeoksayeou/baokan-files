    Beijing (By Our Newspaper) After the capital's literary and art circles achieved a great victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, many writers and young authors deeply felt that to thoroughly defeat bourgeois literary and art thought, resolutely implement the Party's literary and art line, and establish the working class's own literary and art force, the main key lies in strengthening the close connection between writers and the masses of workers and peasants. Not long ago, many writers from the Chinese Writers Association and other literary and art units discussed this issue, and the Writers Association took this as the central task of rectification, abolishing the system of resident writers. Everyone enthusiastically expressed their support for the Party's call and their determination to go deep into the masses of workers and peasants for the long term, move their homes to various places, participate in grassroots work there, or participate in labor, and use their spare time or take creative leave after working for a period to write.
    Prior to this, writers who originally lived in Beijing and had lived and worked in factories and rural areas for a long time included Cao Ming (in Anshan Iron and Steel), Liu Qing (in rural Shaanxi), Lei Jia (in Sanmenxia), and Hu Danfei (in the railway department); not long ago, Zhao Shuli, Ma Feng, and Sun Qian went to rural Shanxi; and Ruan Zhangjing went to Baotou Steel.
    Among the writers and young authors in Beijing, those who are about to go to Hebei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Hunan, Heilongjiang, Qaidam, Gansu, and other places include: Zhang Tianyi, Zhou Libo, Tian Jian, Kang Tuo, Yang Shuo, Jiang Muliang, Shu Qun, Li Ji, Han Zi, Qin Zhaoyang, Xing Ye, Xiao Yin, Cai Qijiao, Luo Binji, Hua Shan, Wen Jie, Jin Jin, Yan Chen, Lu Fei, and more than twenty others.
    Liu Baiyu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Writers Association, has requested a year and a half's leave from the Secretariat, and he plans to go to Heilongjiang to live and write.
    Zhou Libo is rushing to write a novel, estimated to be completed by the end of the year. After the new work is completed, he will return to his hometown—Yiyang, Hunan, to participate in the physical labor of the agricultural cooperative, work as a resident cadre in the cooperative or do grassroots work for the Party, and settle there for a long time. While serving as the editor-in-chief of "People's Literature," Zhang Tianyi will also go deep into the agricultural cooperatives in the Haidian District of Beijing. Jiang Muliang plans to work in the rural areas of Xinhua Tin Mine or Lianyuan, Hunan. Yang Shuo plans to go to the army, working and continuing to write. Kang Tuo plans to go to Hebei Province for a long time and work in a township. Tian Jian plans to work in rural Hebei Province. Li Ji plans to go to Qaidam, Yumen, and Sanbian, focusing on Qaidam, to participate in the work of the construction site's Party committee and spend more time living in drilling teams and exploration teams. Wen Jie wants to go to the Hexi Corridor in Gansu and plans to settle there for a long time. Hua Shan plans to go to the Sanmenxia construction site on the Yellow River, do Party work in the engineering team, and move his family there. Han Zi will go to the Huai River control construction site or rural areas in Anhui to participate in grassroots work. Luo Binji plans to go to rural Heilongjiang. Xiao Yin will go to rural Guangdong; Jin Jin plans to go to rural Zhejiang; Yan Chen and Lu Fei plan to go to Heilongjiang.
    Playwrights Jia Ke, Lan Guang, Liu Canglang, Fan Jingyu, Liu Sha, Qiao Yu, Li Yuezhi, Huang Ti, and Wang Mingfu are all preparing to go down immediately. Jia Ke plans to move his family to the Taiyuan industrial area and do grassroots work for the Party for a long time; Lan Guang will go to a factory in Heilongjiang to do Party work; Liu Canglang plans to go to a factory in Chongqing; Fan Jingyu and Liu Sha plan to go to Yinchuan, Gansu; Qiao Yu plans to work as a resident cadre in an agricultural cooperative in the Xingtai area of ​​Hebei; Li Yuezhi goes to rural Hebei; Huang Ti plans to participate in industrial infrastructure construction work in the Lanzhou area. Wang Mingfu plans to go to the Qingdao Sifang Railway Factory to do workshop branch work or trade union work.
    Film screenwriters Lin Yi, Hai Mo, Du Tan, Yue Ye, Ge Qin, Lin Lan, and Yang Mo are also preparing to go to factories and rural areas. Lin Yi plans to work in a district committee in Beijing, Hai Mo plans to go to a steel industry construction base; Du Tan plans to settle in Henan; Yue Ye plans to go to Heilongjiang; Ge Qin plans to go to Yixing pottery; Lin Lan plans to go to rural Hunan to be a village teacher.
    Fourteen writers in the army, including Wei Wei, Hu Ke, Lu Zhuguo, Han Feng, Lin Liuqi, Xi Hong, Du Feng, and Han Xiliang, will go to coastal defense, border defense, or military sub-district troops by the end of this year or early next year to perform specific tasks and live with the soldiers for a long time.
    Many of the writers who went to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers this time participated in the Yan'an Rectification Movement in 1942 and experienced mass movements such as the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Liberation War, and the Land Reform. Many excellent works by some writers were written only after participating in the struggle of the masses. After the Yan'an Rectification Movement in 1942, a large number of writers responded to the Party's call and went to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to participate in practical work, sharing weal and woe with the masses. Within a few short years, a large number of writers and a large number of excellent works reflecting the lives and struggles of the people in the revolutionary base areas emerged. In this rectification movement, many writers once again responded to the Party's call and were determined to go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a longer period of time to thoroughly solve the problem of the combination of writers and the masses of workers and peasants.
    The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China will assist writers and young authors in Beijing to go deep into the grassroots for a long time, take on specific tasks, and participate in labor.

    北京大批文艺工作者决心长期深入工厂农村和连队
    本报讯　首都文艺界的反右派斗争取得巨大胜利之后，许多作家和青年写作者都深切地感到要彻底战胜资产阶级文艺思想，坚决贯彻党的文艺路线，建立工人阶级自己的文艺队伍，主要关键在于加强作家和工农群众的紧密结合。不久前，中国作家协会及其他文艺单位的许多作家纷纷讨论了这个问题，作家协会并以此作为整改工作的中心任务，取消了驻会作家的制度。大家都热烈表示响应党的号召，决心长期深入到工农群众中去，把家搬到各地去，在那里参加基层工作，或参加劳动，并且在当地利用业余时间或在工作一个时期之后请创作假进行写作。
    在此以前，长时期在工厂、农村中生活和工作的原住在北京的作家有草明（在鞍钢）、柳青（在陕西农村）、雷加（在三门峡）、胡丹沸（在铁道部门）等；不久前赵树理、马烽、孙谦已去山西农村；阮章竞已去包钢。
    在北京的作家和青年作者中，即将到河北、浙江、江苏、安徽、广东、湖南、黑龙江、柴达木、甘肃等地的有：张天翼、周立波、田间、康濯、杨朔、蒋牧良、舒群、李季、菡子、秦兆阳、邢野、肖殷、蔡其穚、骆宾基、华山、闻捷、金近、严辰、逯斐等二十多人。
    作家协会书记处书记、作家刘白羽已向书记处请准了一年半的假期，他准备到黑龙江去生活和写作。
    周立波正在赶写一部长篇小说，估计年底可以写成。俟新作完成后，即回他的故乡——湖南益阳农村去，参加农业社的体力劳动，做驻社干部或党的基层工作，并在那里长期安家落户。张天翼在担任“人民文学”主编的同时，也将深入到北京海淀区的农业合作社。蒋牧良准备到湖南新化锡矿山或涟源等地的农村工作。杨朔准备到部队去，一面工作，一面继续写作。康濯准备长期到河北省，并在一个乡工作。田间准备到河北省农村工作。李季准备到柴达木、玉门、三边去，以柴达木为重点，参加工地的党委工作，并以较多时间生活在钻井队、勘探队。闻捷要到甘肃河西走廊，准备在那里长期落户。华山准备到黄河三门峡工地，做工程队党的工作，并把家搬去。菡子将到安徽治淮工地或农村参加基层工作。骆宾基拟到黑龙江农村。肖殷将到广东农村；金近拟到浙江农村；严辰、逯斐拟到黑龙江去。

    这次到工农兵群众中去的作家中，有许多都参加过1942年延安的整风运动，经历过抗日战争、解放战争和土地改革等群众运动，一些作家的许多优秀作品，都是在参加群众的斗争后才写出来的。1942年延安整风运动后，大批作家响应了党的号召，到工农兵群众中去，参加了实际工作，和群众同甘苦，共患难，短短几年内，便涌现出大批作家和反映革命根据地人民生活和斗争的大批优秀作品。这次整风运动，许多作家又响应了党的号召，决心更长期地到工农兵群众中去，彻底解决作家与工农群众相结合的问题。
    北京市的作家和青年作者，将由中共北京市委协助他们长期深入基层，担任具体工作和参加劳动。
