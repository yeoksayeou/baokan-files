    What Great Cotton!
    More than 400,000 dan of new cotton produced in rural areas of Jiangsu Province have been supplied to textile factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Changzhou and other cities. Yang Shaoqing, a veteran experimental worker at Shanghai State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill, held the high-quality new cotton and looked at it again and again, unable to put it down. He was very grateful that the cotton supplied by the peasant brothers was getting better year by year (top picture). Xu Jingsu, a worker in the roving workshop, sorted out the new cotton slivers and happily thought: This year's cotton harvest is abundant, and textile workers can work heartily again (bottom picture).

    多么好的棉花啊！
    江苏省农村所产新棉已有四十多万担供应给上海、无锡和常州等市的纺织工厂。上海国棉十七厂老试验工杨绍庆拿着质量好的新棉花看来看去，爱不释手。他十分感激农民兄弟供给的棉花一年比一年好（上图）。粗纱车间工人徐景素一面整理新棉条，一面高兴地想：今年棉花丰收，纺织工人又可以痛痛快快地干一气了（下图）。	新华社记者  张申明摄
