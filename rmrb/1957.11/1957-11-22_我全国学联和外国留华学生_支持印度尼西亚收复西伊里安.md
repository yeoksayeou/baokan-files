    (Dispatch) More than one hundred foreign students studying in China and student representatives from Peking University held a "Struggle Against Colonialism and Support for the Recovery of West Irian to the Sovereignty of Indonesia" rally at Peking University on the evening of the 20th.

Subsequently, student representatives from India, Egypt, Syria, the Soviet Union, and other countries spoke one after another, unanimously supporting the just struggle of the Indonesian people and condemning the aggressive acts of the Dutch colonialists. The conference passed a joint statement. The joint statement pointed out: "Whether from a geographical, anthropological, historical, or political point of view, West Irian cannot be separated from Indonesian territory."
