Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 14th: Shanxi Province's education departments have overcome right-leaning conservative sentiments in their literacy campaign, redeploying the work according to the new situation in rural areas, and further launching a farmer's cultural learning movement throughout the province.

Shanxi Province has already eliminated illiteracy for more than one million people, exceeding the target of the first Five-Year Plan. However, since this year, there has been a phenomenon of a large reduction in the number of students in rural areas, and many regions have not completed the literacy tasks.

The Shanxi Provincial Department of Education recently held a symposium with heads of special districts and county education departments to conduct an in-depth discussion on the occurrence of this phenomenon. Everyone generally believed that the current demand of farmers for cultural learning is even more urgent. However, this year's rural production is busy, and learning time is not as abundant as in the past. Furthermore, the literacy targets are different from before. There are not many young illiterate people left. The current literacy targets are mainly women and adults. However, relevant cadres in various places have insufficient understanding of these new situations in rural areas and are still following the old teaching methods, emphasizing centralized uniformity and pursuing formality. They have not adopted flexible, diverse, and small-scale teaching methods that are closely integrated with production and suitable for the characteristics of women and adults. Some places have even relaxed the leadership of literacy work. The meeting criticized various right-leaning conservative ideas based on this situation. Subsequently, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Education redeployed rural literacy work. It was decided to immediately adopt various measures that are adapted to the current situation in rural areas, and to continue to actively and steadily carry out farmers' spare-time cultural education, with literacy as the main focus, throughout the province.

Now, according to the large-scale agricultural capital construction tasks this winter, various places are adopting small and diverse forms and methods such as package teaching and learning, children teaching parents, couples teaching each other, learning as you go, and decentralized teaching. In order to help farmers who have just escaped illiteracy continue to improve and consolidate their learning achievements, various places have also added junior high school classes and higher elementary school classes to the people's schools according to specific conditions. The cultural and educational departments of each special county are formulating literacy plans from this winter to next year from the bottom up and are beginning to train literacy backbones and establish and improve literacy associations one after another.

### 山西采取灵活、多样、小型的教学方式  普遍开展农民文化学习运动

    山西采取灵活、多样、小型的教学方式
    普遍开展农民文化学习运动
    新华社太原14日电　山西省文教部门克服扫除文盲工作中的右倾保守情绪，按照农村新情况，重新部署扫盲工作，进一步在全省开展农民文化学习运动。
    山西省已经扫除了一百多万文盲，超额完成了第一个五年计划的任务。但是今年以来，农村中发生了学员大量减员的现象，许多地区没有完成扫盲任务。
    山西省教育厅最近召开了专区、县文教部门负责人座谈会，就这一现象的发生进行了深入的讨论。大家普遍认为：当前农民对文化学习的要求是更加迫切了。但是，今年农村生产繁忙，学习时间不像过去那样充裕。再则是扫盲对象与以前不同了，青年文盲已经不多，现在扫盲对象主要是妇女和壮年。而各地有关干部对农村中的这些新情况认识不足，仍然沿袭老一套的教学方法，强调集中划一，追逐形式；没有采取密切结合生产和适合于妇女、壮年特点的灵活、多样、小型的教学方式。有的地方甚至放松了扫盲工作的领导。会议根据这一情况，批判了各种右倾保守思想。随后，山西省教育厅对农村扫盲工作重新作了部署。决定立即采取与农村当前情况相适应的各项措施，继续积极稳步地在全省开展以扫盲为主的农民业余文化教育。
    现在各地根据今年冬季农业基本建设任务大的情况，正在采取包教包学，孩子教父母、夫妻互教、随教随学、分散教学等小型多样的形式和方法。为了帮助刚刚脱离文盲状态的农民继续提高和巩固学习成绩，各地还根据具体条件在民校增设了初中班和高小班。各专县文教部门正在自下而上制订今冬起至明年的扫盲计划，并陆续开始训练扫盲骨干和建立、健全扫盲协会。
