Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 9th: Syrian officials released a message on November 8th stating that Turkey is conducting new provocations on the Syrian border.

    An army headquarters press bulletin stated that on November 7th, a Turkish patrol engaged in aggressive activities against the village of Jekara, near Qamishli, Syria, and opened fire on residents without provocation. However, after the Syrian People’s Resistance Army returned fire, the patrol was forced to cease firing and retreat.

    Shathila, the commander of the northwestern border region of Syria, accused on November 8th that U.S. military officers are carrying out combat missions alongside Turkish troops massing on the Syrian border, not merely serving as advisors to the Turkish military.

    During a meeting with a group of foreign journalists at his headquarters in Aleppo, he also stated that the number of Turkish troops massing is not decreasing, but increasing. He pointed out that the main concentration points are in the Turkish cities of Alexandretta, Antioch, and Karakhan, as well as the Bilan Mountains, with the closest outposts only six or seven kilometers from the Syrian border.

    Shathila said that the Turkish troop buildup is being carried out either under U.S. instructions or with U.S. consent.

    Syria is continuing preparations to defend against possible aggression. A military spokesman announced that the Syrian Air Force and Navy are scheduled to conduct joint exercises on the 8th and 9th.

    Defense fortifications are being constructed in Damascus. Fortifications have also begun in Tartus, northwest of Homs, and Deir ez-Zor, south of Qamishli.

Xinhua News Agency, November 9th: According to TASS, New York, November 8th: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar told a group of United Nations reporters before leaving New York that there are some difficulties in the relationship between the United States and Syria, and the root of these difficulties lies in the attitude of certain U.S. politicians towards Syria.

    Bitar emphasized that Syria firmly opposes policies that divide Arab countries. He said that until today, the relationship between Arab countries and Western countries has not been based on the principles of equality and mutual respect. The United States still adheres to this unequal policy in its treatment of Arab countries. All Arab countries hope for unity, but the policy pursued by the United States in the Middle East aims to undermine this unity. This policy cannot succeed because it contradicts the interests of Arab countries and the interests of the United States and other countries.

    土耳其在叙边境进行新挑衅
    叙军方斥美国军官在背后牵线
    比塔尔指责美国破坏阿拉伯国家团结
    据新华社大马士革9日电　叙利亚官方11月8日发布消息说，土耳其又在叙利亚边境进行新的挑衅。
    陆军总部发表新闻公报说，一支土耳其巡逻队7日对叙利亚卡米什利附近的杰卡拉村进行侵略活动，并且无端向居民开枪，但在叙利亚人民抗敌军回击后，这支巡逻队不得不停止开枪，并被迫撤退。
    叙利亚西北边区司令沙提拉8日指责说，美国军官和在叙利亚边境集结的土耳其军队一起执行战斗任务，而不仅仅是担任土耳其军队的顾问。
    他在阿勒颇总部接见一批外国记者时还说，土耳其所集结的军队不但不是在减少，而是还在增加。他指出，主要的集结地点在土耳其境内的亚历山大勒达、安提俄克和卡拉克汗等城市以及比兰山地，而前哨最近的距离叙利亚边境只有六、七公里。
    沙提拉说，土耳其集结军队是按照美国的指示或者得到美国的同意的。
    叙利亚正在继续准备防御可能发生的侵略。军方发言人宣布，叙利亚的空军和海军预定在8日和9日两天举行联合演习。
    大马士革的防御工事正在构筑中。霍姆斯西北的塔尔托斯和卡米什利以南的德里奏尔也已经开始构筑防御工事。
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社纽约8日讯：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在离开纽约前对一批驻联合国记者说，美国和叙利亚之间的关系上存在着一些困难，这些困难的根源在于目前美国某些政界人士对叙利亚的态度。
    比塔尔强调说，叙利亚坚决反对分裂阿拉伯国家的政策。他说，直到今天，阿拉伯国家和西方国家之间的关系并没有根据平等和互相尊重的原则。美国现在对待阿拉伯国家仍然奉行这种不平等政策。所有阿拉伯国家都希望团结，而美国在中近东所奉行的政策的目的是破坏这个团结。这种政策不可能获得成功，因为这种政策同阿拉伯各国的利益，同美国和其他国家的利益都是相矛盾的。
