Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Egyptian officials and public opinion warmly welcome the Soviet Union's economic assistance.

Cairo's "Evening News" reported on the 21st that Cairo officials contrasted the Soviet Union's generous assistance to Egypt with the attitude taken by the American-controlled World Bank. Before Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, it applied to the World Bank for loans to finance the Aswan High Dam project. After lengthy negotiations and repeated delays, the World Bank rejected Egypt's application, and seized the opportunity to portray the Egyptian economy as a mess, not to mention the various conditions it attached.

Egyptian Minister of Industry Sidqi said on the 22nd that the Soviet Union's economic assistance to Egypt will be used to build shipyards, automobile factories, tractor factories, and machine tool factories. He said that Soviet assistance will also provide funds for Egypt's oil exploration and mining industries.

The minister is scheduled to go to Moscow in a few days to discuss the details of Soviet economic assistance to Egypt. This economic assistance was decided during Egyptian Defense Minister Amer's talks with the Soviet government in Moscow.

The "Al-Ahram" editorial on the 21st stated that Soviet assistance is an "important factor in guaranteeing positive neutralism and Arab nationalism." "Al Akhbar" said on the 22nd that Soviet economic assistance to Egypt will greatly increase Egypt's national income and provide a large number of employment opportunities for Egyptian workers. The newspaper said that this means "every Egyptian will be able to get more income and live a better life."

According to a Damascus report: "Al-Nour" published an editorial, hailing the Soviet Union's economic assistance agreement to Egypt as a "victory for the Arab people." The editorial said, "The head of imperialism, the United States, is annoyed by this new victory of Egypt because it knows that every victory Egypt achieves will strengthen its own independence and develop its own economy." The newspaper also stated that the connection between the two Arab countries, or the connection between Arab countries and socialist countries, will help shatter the shackles of imperialism.

    埃及热烈欢迎苏联的无私援助
    叙报认为有助于粉碎帝国主义的桎梏
    本报综合报道　据新华社23日讯：埃及官方和舆论热烈欢迎苏联的经济援助。
    开罗“晚报”21日报道，开罗负责人士把苏联很慷慨地给予埃及援助的情况同美国控制的世界银行采取的态度作了对比。埃及在把苏伊士运河收归国有以前，为了筹措阿斯旺高水坝工程经费曾经向世界银行申请贷款，世界银行在进行了长期的谈判和多次拖延以后拒绝了埃及的申请，并且还抓住这个机会把埃及经济说成一团糟，更不用说它还要附带种种条件了。
    埃及工业部长西德基22日说，苏联给埃及的经济援助将被用来建造造船厂、汽车工厂、拖拉机工厂和工作母机工厂。他说，苏联的援助还将为埃及的石油勘探和矿业提供资金。
    这位部长预定在几天以后去莫斯科商谈苏联对埃及经济援助的细节。这项经济援助是在埃及国防部长阿密尔在莫斯科同苏联政府会谈时决定的。
    “金字塔报”21日的社论说，苏联的援助是保障“积极的中立主义和阿拉伯民族主义的重要因素”。“消息报”22日说，苏联对埃及的经济援助将使埃及的国民收入大大增加，为埃及工人提供大量就业的机会。这家报纸说，这意味着“每一个埃及人将能够得到更多的收入，过更好的生活”。
    另据大马士革消息：“光明报”发表社论，欢呼苏联给埃及经济援助的协议为“阿拉伯人民的胜利”。社论说，“帝国主义的首脑美国对埃及的这一新胜利感到恼怒，因为它知道，埃及所取得的每一个胜利都将加强它自己的独立，发展自己的经济。”报纸还说，两个阿拉伯国家的联系，或者阿拉伯国家和社会主义国家之间的联系都会有助于粉碎帝国主义的桎梏。（附图片）
