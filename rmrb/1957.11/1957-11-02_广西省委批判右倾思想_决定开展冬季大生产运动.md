    Guangxi Provincial Party Committee Criticizes Right-leaning Thought
    Decides to Launch Winter Production Campaign
    This newspaper, Nanning dispatch: The Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in a telephone conference held on the evening of October 25th, demanded that all regions in the province launch a mass-based, large-scale five major production campaign this winter and next spring. The content of the five major production campaign is: water conservancy construction, vigorous fertilizer accumulation, winter planting and winter plowing, forest protection and afforestation, and sideline production focusing on pig raising. This winter and next spring, the province will expand irrigated area by 5 million mu, of which 3.5 million mu will have drought resistance capabilities of more than 50 days; the winter planting area will be 10.063 million mu, of which 5.58 million mu will be grain crops, 2.25 million mu will be green manure, and 2.8 million mu will be other crops such as rapeseed, winter flue-cured tobacco, feed, and vegetables; 5 million mu will be afforested (excluding state-owned forest farms). Liu Jianxun, First Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, in his speech at the meeting, called on all regions to launch a high tide of production this winter and next spring in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session. Liu Jianxun pointed out that at present, many leading organs and cadres at all levels have right-leaning conservative ideas on agricultural production issues, lack enthusiasm, fear recklessness, and believe that the more conservative the plan is, the better. Liu Jianxun demanded that Party committees at all levels must ensure that the broad masses of cadres fully estimate that after the rectification and great debate in rural areas this year, the production enthusiasm of farmers will inevitably be greatly encouraged, and cadres must be educated to carry forward the spirit of Communists who are not afraid of any difficulties and move forward bravely. In order to launch a high tide of production, after carrying out the great debate on the two roads, all regions should launch a great debate on the forty articles in the National Agricultural Development Program. The responsible comrades of each prefectural committee expressed strong confidence in carrying out the five major production campaigns this winter and next spring in their speeches. The winter planting task in the Yishan area was originally allocated at 2.33 million mu, but this area voluntarily increased it to 2.65 million mu; the afforestation task was originally allocated at 1.25 million mu, but this special zone is preparing to afforest 1.5 million mu; the irrigated area for water conservancy construction throughout the region is also prepared to reach 1.2 million mu. The winter planting task for the provincial-level counties in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture was originally allocated at 1.5 million mu, but these areas are preparing to plant 2 million mu in winter.

    广西省委批判右倾思想
    决定开展冬季大生产运动
    本报南宁电　中共广西省委在10月25日晚召开的电话会议，要求全省各地在今冬明春开展一个群众性的大规模的五大生产运动。五大生产运动的内容是：兴修水利、大力积肥、冬种冬耕、护林造林、以养猪为主的副业生产。全省在今冬明春将扩大灌溉面积五百万亩，其中抗旱能力在五十天以上的灌溉面积三百五十万亩；冬种面积一千零六十三万亩，其中粮食作物五百五十八万亩，绿肥二百二十五万亩，其他油菜、冬种烤烟、饲料、蔬菜等二百八十万亩；造林五百万亩（不包括国营林场）。中共广西省委第一书记刘建勋在会议上的讲话中号召各地根据三中全会精神，在今冬明春掀起一个大生产高潮。刘建勋指出，目前，不少领导机关和各级干部在农业生产问题上有右倾保守思想，劲头不大，害怕冒进，以为计划订得愈保守愈好。刘建勋要求各级党委必须使广大干部充分估计到今年农村经过整风和大辩论后，必然会大大鼓舞农民的生产积极性，必须教育干部发扬共产党人不怕任何困难的精神，勇敢向前迈进。为了掀起一个生产大高潮，各地要在进行两条道路的大辩论以后，开展一个关于全国农业发展纲要中的四十条的大辩论。各个地委负责同志在发言中对开展今冬明春的五大生产运动表现了坚强的信心。宜山地区的冬种任务，原来分配的是二百三十三万亩，但这个区却自动增至二百六十五万亩；造林任务原来分配的是一百二十五万亩，但这个专区却准备造林一百五十万亩；全区兴修水利灌溉面积也准备达到一百二十万亩。桂西僮族自治州各省属县的冬种任务，原来分配的是一百五十万亩，但这些地区却准备冬种二百万亩。
