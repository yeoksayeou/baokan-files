Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its 85th meeting on the 16th.

The meeting, after discussion, principally approved the State Council's "Interim Regulations on Handling the Retirement of Workers and Staff," the State Council's "Interim Regulations on Wage Treatment for Ordinary Workers and Handymen in Enterprises, Institutions, and State Organs," the State Council's "Interim Regulations on the Length of Apprenticeship and Living Allowances for Apprentices in State-owned, Joint State-Private, Cooperative-Operated, and Individually-Operated Enterprises and Institutions," and the State Council's "Interim Regulations on Leave and Wage Treatment for Workers and Staff Returning Home to Visit Relatives."

Before the discussion, Minister of Labor Ma Wenrui explained these four interim regulations formulated by the State Council. He said that the purpose of the State Council's "Interim Regulations on Handling the Retirement of Workers and Staff" is to make certain changes to the current regulations regarding retirement conditions and post-retirement benefits, so as to enable those employees who should retire to do so. This will not only properly settle this group of employees, but also help streamline institutions, improve production and work efficiency; it can also save expenses, which can be used to recruit more young apprentices, facilitating labor employment.

Regarding the "Interim Regulations on Wage Treatment for Ordinary Workers and Handymen in Enterprises, Institutions, and State Organs," Ma Wenrui said that the purpose of formulating this regulation is to reasonably stipulate the wage treatment for ordinary workers and handymen, and at the same time coordinate urban-rural relations, so as to help overcome the phenomenon of a large influx of farmers into cities. The regulation stipulates that the wage standards for ordinary workers and handymen will uniformly be formulated by the Provincial, Autonomous Region, and Directly-Administered Municipal People's Committees in conjunction with local conditions, so as to change the original phenomenon of relatively high wage treatment for ordinary workers and handymen. The new wage treatment standards apply to newly hired ordinary workers and handymen; the original wage treatment for existing ordinary workers and handymen will not be changed.

The "Interim Regulations on the Length of Apprenticeship and Living Allowances for Apprentices in Enterprises and Institutions" determines that the length of apprenticeship should be appropriately extended, and the treatment during the apprenticeship period should be lowered. The draft stipulates that the length of apprenticeship should be three years. For certain trades with particularly complex technologies, the length of apprenticeship should be even longer than three years. As for a small number of trades with truly simpler technologies, it is also allowed to appropriately shorten the length of apprenticeship, but the shortest should not be less than two years. During the apprenticeship period, the unit where the apprentice is located will provide a monthly living allowance. The standard of living allowance is calculated and stipulated according to the local or industry's general food expenses for low-level employees plus a small amount of pocket money. Ma Wenrui said that the purpose of formulating this regulation is to fundamentally change the current inappropriate apprenticeship system, gradually establish a new apprenticeship system that absorbs the advantages of our country's past apprenticeship system and is suitable for the basic characteristics of our country's large population and backward economy, so that the broad masses of young people can obtain more employment opportunities, and so that the broad masses of apprentices can truly be cultivated into a new generation of our working class with good skills, good ideology, and good health, so as to ensure the victorious advance of our country's socialist construction cause.

In his explanation of the "Interim Regulations on Leave and Wage Treatment for Workers and Staff Returning Home to Visit Relatives," Ma Wenrui pointed out that in order to appropriately satisfy the requirements of workers and staff who live apart from their families in two places to return home to visit relatives, to encourage workers and staff not to bring their families, to encourage the families of workers and staff who have already entered the city to return to their hometowns, to reduce the pressure on urban housing, transportation, and consumer goods supply, and to plan the time for workers and staff to return home to visit relatives in a planned way, to ensure that the attendance rate of enterprises is normal before and after holidays such as the Spring Festival, and to avoid inconsistent treatment between various departments, it is now necessary to first formulate such a nationally unified method of granting leave for workers and staff to return home to visit relatives to solve the current existing problems, and then further transition to the establishment of a more complete annual leave system in the future.

After these four interim regulations are approved at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the 16th, they will be sent by the State Council to enterprises, institutions, state organs, and people's organizations for extensive discussion in conjunction with the current rectification movement, and then revised and modified based on the opinions raised. If there are no changes in principle, they will be promulgated and implemented by the State Council.

    关于职工退休、普通工勤杂工工资、学徒制度、职工探亲给假等问题
    人大常委会原则批准国务院四项规定
    将由国务院发到各单位结合当前整风运动进行广泛讨论
    新华社16日讯  全国人民代表大会常务委员会16日举行了第八十五次会议。
    会议经过讨论，原则批准了国务院关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定，国务院关于企业、事业和国家机关中普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定，国务院关于国营、公私合营、合作社营、个体经营的企业和事业单位的学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定，国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定。
    在会议进行讨论以前，劳动部部长马文瑞对国务院的这四个暂行规定作了说明。他说，国务院制定的关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定，目的就是要对于现行规定中的退休的条件和退休以后的待遇作某些改变，以便使那些应该退休的职工退休。这样，既可以妥善地安置这一部分职工，又有利于精简机构，提高生产和工作效率；还能够节约经费开支，用来多吸收一些青年学徒，便于安排劳动就业。
    关于“国务院关于企业、事业和国家机关中普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定”，马文瑞说，现在制定的这个规定，目的就是要合理地规定普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇，同时协调城乡关系，以利于克服农民大量流入城市的现象。规定中确定今后普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇标准一律改由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会结合当地实际情况制定，以改变原来普通工和勤杂工工资待遇偏高的现象。新的工资待遇标准适用于今后新录用的普通工、勤杂工，对于原有的普通工、勤杂工，原来的工资待遇不予变动。
      “国务院关于企业和事业单位的学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定”，确定适当加长学徒的学习期限和降低学习期间的待遇。草案规定学徒的学习期限为三年。某些技术特殊复杂的工种，学徒的学习期限还应该长于三年。至于少数技术确实比较简单的工种，也允许适当缩短学习期限，但是最短也不得少于二年。学徒在学习期限内，由所在单位按月发给生活补贴。生活补贴的标准，按照当地或者本行业一般低级职工的伙食费另加少数零用钱计算规定。马文瑞说，制定这个规定的目的，在于根本改变现行的不适当的学徒制度，逐步建立起一套吸取我国过去学徒制度中的长处的适合于我国人口多而经济落后这一基本特点的新的学徒制度，使广大青年能够获得更多的就业机会，使广大学徒能够真正培养成为技术好、思想好、身体好的我国工人阶级的新生一代，以保证我国社会主义建设事业的胜利前进。
    马文瑞在关于“国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定”的说明中指出，为了适当地满足同家属分住在两地的职工回家探亲的要求，鼓励职工不带家属，鼓励已经进城的职工家属回乡居住，减轻城市住房、交通、消费品供应等方面的压力，和有计划地安排职工回家探亲的时间，保证企业在春节等假期前后出勤率正常，以及避免各部门之间待遇不一致，现在有必要先制定这样一个全国统一实行的职工回家探亲给假的办法，以解决当前存在的问题，然后在将来再进一步过渡到建立更完善的年休假制度。
    这四个暂行规定在全国人民代表大会常务委员会16日的会议上批准后，将由国务院发到企业、事业单位和国家机关、人民团体结合当前整风运动进行广泛讨论，然后根据所提意见汇总修改，如无原则性的改动，即由国务院公布施行。
