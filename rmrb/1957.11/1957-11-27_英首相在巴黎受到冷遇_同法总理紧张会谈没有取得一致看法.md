Xinhua News Agency, November 26th, Paris: British Prime Minister Macmillan arrived in Paris at noon on the 25th and received a less than enthusiastic reception. Upon arrival, he immediately began talks with French Prime Minister Gaillard over lunch. The talks continued almost uninterrupted until late at night.

At the end of the first part of the talks in the evening, a French government spokesman announced that the two sides "did not reach a consensus" on the issues of US-British arms supply to Tunisia and the North African issue.

After the late-night talks, the French spokesman said that the evening talks mainly focused on the issues of "mutual reliance" and military and scientific cooperation among the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. According to the British spokesman, the two prime ministers have not yet reached any conclusions.

The one-day meeting, originally scheduled for one day, will be extended, and the two prime ministers will continue their talks on the 26th. According to the French spokesman, after the current talks between the heads of government of Britain and France, the two countries will continue to negotiate on the above issues until the meeting of the heads of government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on December 16.

The heads of government of Britain and France held this meeting at a time of strained relations between the two countries. Macmillan said upon arriving in Paris that the current "dispute" between Britain and France was "too serious". While Macmillan and Gaillard were talking, hundreds of French people demonstrated near the British and American embassies in Paris, shouting: "Hang Macmillan!" "Americans go home!"

This meeting is also one of a series of bilateral talks currently being held among member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This series of talks indicates the anger and resistance of the US and British allies to the US and British plans to forcibly establish a US-British "two-giant council" within the North Atlantic military group, demanding that major policy issues be consulted in advance within the North Atlantic Group. According to London diplomatic sources, the United States and Britain have rejected this request. This casts a shadow on the current talks between the heads of government of Britain and France, as well as on the upcoming meeting of the heads of government of the North Atlantic Group.

"Le Monde" said: "The possibility of eliminating differences is small."

    英首相在巴黎受到冷遇
    同法总理紧张会谈没有取得一致看法
    新华社26日讯　巴黎消息：英国首相麦克米伦25日午间到达巴黎，受到并不热烈的接待。到达后，他立即同法国总理盖伊阿在午餐桌上开始会谈。会谈几乎毫不间断地一直进行到深夜。
    在傍晚时分第一部分会谈结束后，法国政府发言人宣布，在所讨论的美英供应突尼斯军火的问题和北非问题上，双方“并没有取得一致的看法”。
    在深夜会谈结束后，法国发言人说，晚上的会谈主要集中在北大西洋集团成员国“互相依靠”和进行军事、科学合作的问题上。据英国发言人宣布，两国总理还没有得出任何结论。
    原定举行一天的会谈将延期结束，两国总理在26日还要继续会谈。据法国发言人表示，在目前英法两国政府首脑的会谈结束后，两国还要就上述问题继续进行商谈，直到12月16日北大西洋集团政府首脑会议开会为止。
    英法两国政府首脑是在两国关系紧张的时候举行这次会谈的。麦克米伦在到达巴黎时说，目前英法两国的“争端”是“太严重”了。就在麦克米伦和盖伊阿会谈的时候，有好几百法国人在巴黎英国大使馆和美国大使馆附近示威，高呼：“麦克米伦该处绞刑！”“美国人滚回去！”
    这次会谈也是目前北大西洋集团成员国间进行的一系列双边会谈之一。这一系列的会谈表示了美英的盟国对美英打算在北大西洋军事集团内强行建立美英“两巨头理事会”的愤慨和反抗，它们要求在北大西洋集团内部就重大政策问题事先进行协商。据伦敦外交界人士说，美国和英国已经拒绝了这个要求。这对目前的英法政府首脑会谈，同时也对将要举行的北大西洋集团政府首脑会议，投上了一层阴影。
    “世界报”说：“消除意见分歧的可能性很小。”
