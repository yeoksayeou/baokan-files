Big-Character Posters in Government Offices

Why is there a gap between leadership thinking and mass thinking?

The idea of streamlining personnel is not something that was brought up today. Not to mention things from further back, in early 1955, after Chairman Mao issued the call for increased production and thrift, the central government decided to tighten up organizations and personnel. At that time, when the General Store discussed the call for increased production and thrift, the masses were very enthusiastic about streamlining organizations and personnel, unanimously believing that the General Store's organization was bloated and there was serious overstaffing, and that it should be streamlined in accordance with the spirit of the central government. However, when Manager Liu made a report on increasing production and thrift, he said: "There is no problem with the General Store's personnel organization, our main task is to economize." This poured cold water on everyone.

In the summer of the same year, the managers called on some cadres to solicit opinions and discuss the problems existing in the General Store. At that time, many comrades again raised the issue of overstaffing, that many cadres were not playing a role, and that they should be streamlined. However, Manager Shi said, "It's not that there are too many people, but that there are too few," and argued with everyone until his face turned red.

Why is there such a large gap between the thinking of the managers and the thinking of the masses? Why do they desperately transfer people upwards, regardless of the central government's regulations and local needs? I think the main reason is that they have the idea of "the more the better" in the use of personnel and a departmentalism that disregards the overall situation at play. At the same time, it also shows a bureaucratic style of not humbly listening to the opinions of the masses.

I hope that in this rectification campaign, we will seriously examine the erroneous thinking in the use of personnel and the bureaucratic style of being divorced from the masses.

Kicking the Ball is Not the Solution

Because the scope of responsibilities and specific division of labor of the General Store's various departments are not clear enough, the phenomenon of "kicking the ball" in processing documents often occurs. This not only brings difficulties to the clerks, but more importantly, affects the normal progress of work. For example, regarding the issue of bookstore publicity, on June 8 this year, a letter was received from the Zijin Branch suggesting the printing of some publicity materials to promote the care of books and hygiene to readers in bookstores. I thought this document should be handled by the Organization and Technology Department, but the Organization and Technology Department returned it after seven or eight days, saying: "It's not ours, it's the Business Department's." But the Business Department didn't want it either, and returned it to the Organization and Technology Department. This went back and forth for twenty days, until June 27, when a reply was finally given.

The general numbering issue was first managed by the Statistics Section, then by the Business Department, and later by the Organization and Technology Department as well. However, when the lower-level stores sent request documents, none of the three departments would take charge, pushing responsibility onto each other, leaving the clerks dizzy and not knowing what to do. I won't give more examples like this, but the specific staff members of each department have felt it. It is suggested that the leadership quickly clarify the scope of authority and specific division of labor of each department, and create specific regulations to completely change the phenomenon of "kicking the ball" in processing documents, in order to facilitate the progress of work.

    机关里的大字报
    为什么领导思想和群众思想有距离
    精简人员并非今天才提出来。远的不说，1955年初毛主席提出增产节约号召之后，中央决定紧缩机构人员。当时总店在讨论增产节约号召时，群众对精简机构人员情绪很高，一致认为总店机构臃肿，人浮于事的现象严重，应该根据中央精神精简。但刘经理在作增产节约报告时则说：“总店的人员机构没有什么问题，我们的任务主要是节约”。给大家泼了一盆冷水。
    同年夏天，经理们号召一部分干部征求意见。讨论总店存在的问题。当时很多同志又提出人浮于事，很多干部都没有发挥作用，应该精简。而史经理则说“不是人多，而是人少”，并和大家争得面红耳赤。
    经理们的思想为什么和群众思想有这样大的距离呢？为什么不顾中央的规定和地方需要而拚命往上调人呢？我认为主要是他们在用人问题上存在着“多多益善”的思想和不顾大局的本位主义在作怪。同时也表现了不虚心听取群众意见的官僚主义作风。
    希望在这次整风中认真检查在用人问题上的错误思想，和脱离群众的官僚主义作风。　新华书店总店　蔡尔颖
    踢皮球不是办法
    由于总店各处室的职责范围和具体分工不够明确，踢皮球式的处理文件的现象常有发生，这不仅给文书带来了困难，更重要的是影响了工作正常进行。如有关门市宣传问题，今年6月8日收到紫金支店来信建议印刷一部分在门市向读者宣传爱护书籍、注意卫生的宣传材料。我认为这个文件应由组技处处理，但组技处过了七八天退回来了，说：不是我们的，是业务处的。而业务处也不要，又退给组技处。这样来回踢了二十来天，直到6月27号才复了文。
    总编号问题先由统计科管，业务处管，后来组技处也管，但是下级店来了请示文件，三个部门都不管，相互推让，弄得文书是晕头转向，不知何处是好。像这样的例子不再多举，各处室具体工作人员都有所感受。建议领导上很快地明确各处室的职权范围和具体的分工，并制造具体条文规定下来，彻底改变踢皮球式的处理文件的现象，以利工作进行。　新华书店总店　戴书智
