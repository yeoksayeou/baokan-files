    The Manifest Victory of the Leninist National Policy
    The Kazakh Republic Radiates Splendor
    Interview with Comrade Kunaev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Republic, by Our Newspaper Reporter
    (Our newspaper, Moscow, 3rd dispatch) Comrade Kunaev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Republic of the Soviet Union, said to reporters:
    The Kazakh people, resurrected by the great October Revolution, have traversed a broad and glorious road in the past forty years. Like all the Soviet republics, Kazakhstan has completed the great socialist transformation. In a short historical period, it has made great strides and become a socialist republic, awarded the Order of Lenin, a country of prosperous industry and collective and state farms. Its achievements in economic and cultural fields are a clear demonstration of the victory of the Party's Leninist national policy and the idea of ​​friendship among all nationalities.
    The Great October Revolution guaranteed the vigorous development of the productive forces of Kazakhstan. Here, a large-scale socialist industry has been established. Last year, the total industrial output was thirty-six times that of 1913. The main sectors of heavy industry have been established: non-ferrous metal smelting industry, coal industry, oil industry, and the development of steel, machinery manufacturing, machine tool manufacturing, construction and building materials industries. Three thousand industrial enterprises, more than two thousand power stations, twenty-three new cities and more than one hundred workers' villages have been built.
    Currently, nine economic zones have been established in Kazakhstan. The government of the Republic is committed to further developing economic sectors of all-Union significance. Kazakhstan produces 78% of the lead, 57% of the copper, 67% of the zinc, and 58% of the cadmium and tungsten in the entire Soviet Union. It is one of the countries in the world with the richest reserves of chromium, vanadium, iron, copper, lead and zinc, and its reserves of molybdenum, coal, oil, manganese and other rare and radioactive elements also occupy a major position in the Soviet Union. An iron ore deposit recently discovered in Kostanay Oblast has reserves of more than 10 billion tons, two and a half times the known reserves of the Ruhr region.
    In the near future, Kazakhstan will become one of the powerful bases for the production of non-ferrous metals, iron, steel, electricity, coal and oil in the entire Soviet Union. Steel production in 1956 reached fifty-one times that of 1945, and when the Karaganda Metallurgical Plant, which is under construction, is put into production, it will produce more steel, iron and steel products. Coal production in 1956 was 350 times that before the revolution. New coal mining enterprises are being built on the basis of the coalfield discovered in Da Turgai. The coal reserves here are 43 billion tons, much more than the Karaganda coalfield. Electricity production is now about 7 billion kilowatt-hours, 5,500 times that of 1913. The Shishimsk Hydroelectric Power Station has already generated electricity, and the second large hydroelectric power station, the Bukhtarma Hydroelectric Power Station, is now under construction.
    In Kazakhstan, basic construction and industrial output will develop and increase at a higher rate than in the entire Soviet Union. The construction of some huge heavy industrial units has already begun. The Karaganda Metallurgical Plant (or Kazakhstan's Magnitogorsk) is being built, and the construction of the Sokolovsk-Sarbay Mining and Concentration Combine, the largest machinery manufacturing enterprise - the Pavlodar Combine Harvester Factory, the Petropavlovsk Rolling Equipment Factory, the Chimkent Cement Factory and other industrial units are proceeding smoothly. After the Pavlodar Combine Harvester Factory is put into production, it can produce 60,000 grain combine harvesters annually, 12,000 more than the total output of the Soviet Union in 1955.
    Great changes have also taken place in Kazakhstan's agriculture. In the past four years, great efforts have been made to reclaim wasteland, and 20 million hectares of new land have been reclaimed, equivalent to the total grain sown area of ​​the United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and West Germany. Another one million hectares of new land were reclaimed this year. The sown area has reached 27.8 million hectares, while in 1953 it was only 9.8 million hectares. The will of the Party and the people has turned Kazakhstan into one of the most important granaries in the Soviet Union.
    State farms account for a large proportion of agricultural production in the Republic. There are more than 800 state farms and 340 machine tractor stations, which own 208,000 tractors, about 85,000 combine harvesters and many other agricultural machines.
    The achievements in the development of the grain economy have opened up bright prospects for the development of animal husbandry. The agricultural workers of the Republic enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and the government to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita production of meat, milk and fats in the next few years, and decided to increase meat production by two and a half times, pork by six and a half times, milk by two times, and wool by two point seven times by 1960 compared with 1956. The number of sheep will increase by more than two times, and the number of cattle will increase by one and a half times. By 1960, it will have at least 40 million sheep, with an annual output of more than 100,000 tons of wool.
    The transportation situation in the Republic has been greatly improved with the development of industry and agriculture. By the end of 1956, the length of railway lines had reached nearly 10,000 kilometers, while in 1913 it was only 2,000 kilometers. In 1955 alone, more than 1,000 kilometers of railways were laid in the reclaimed areas. In addition, the construction of the Aktogay to the border railway, which is called the Road of Friendship, is now progressing smoothly, which will greatly promote the friendly economic ties between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
    The unprecedented upsurge of culture is one of the major victories achieved by the Kazakh people in the era of Soviet power. Last year, the number of experts working in the national economic sector was five times that of 1941. Now, there are twenty-five universities and colleges in Kazakhstan, and the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh Republic has been established. The Kazakh Academy of Agricultural Sciences was also recently established. The Republic has a total of 127 scientific research institutions. Before the revolution, there were about 2,000 ordinary schools of various types in Kazakhstan, with only 57,900 students. Now there are more than 9,000 such schools, with 1.35 million people studying in them; among them, 500,000 Kazakh children study in their own national language. In 1956, we published 639 kinds of books in Kazakh, totaling about 8 million copies. The number of newspapers published in Kazakhstan now is more than that of nine countries including Belgium, Austria, Chile, Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Bolivia, and Colombia, while the population of these countries is ten times that of Kazakhstan.
    The Kazakh Republic has a long common border with the friendly neighboring People's Republic of China. The cultural ties between the Kazakh and Chinese people are developing and consolidating year by year.
    The working people of Soviet Kazakhstan attribute all their achievements to the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and to the unbreakable friendship of all nationalities. They are closely united around the Party and the government, and greet the great October Revolution with new achievements in the political life of the country, the struggle to maintain peace, and economic and cultural construction. The Kazakh people believe that it is their primary patriotic duty to increase their contribution in accomplishing the historic resolutions of the 20th National Congress of our Party, in the common cause of building communism, and in consolidating the power of our beloved motherland.

    列宁主义民族政策胜利的明证
    哈萨克共和国放出灿烂的光彩
    共和国部长会议主席库纳也夫向本报记者发表谈话
    本报莫斯科3日电　苏联哈萨克共和国部长会议主席库纳也夫向记者发表谈话说：
    为伟大的十月所复活的哈萨克人民，四十年来走过了宽阔光辉的道路。像在所有的苏维埃共和国一样，在哈萨克斯坦完成了伟大的社会主义改革。在短短的历史时期内，它有了长足进展，变成了荣获列宁勋章的社会主义共和国——繁荣的工业和集体农庄、国营农场的国家。它在经济和文化各方面的成就，是党的列宁主义民族政策和各族人民友爱思想胜利的明证。
    伟大的十月革命保证了哈萨克斯坦生产力的蓬勃发展。这里建立了规模宏大的社会主义工业。去年工业总产量为1913年的三十六倍。建立了重工业的主要部门：有色金属冶炼业、煤炭工业、石油工业，发展了钢铁、机器制造、机床制造、建筑和建筑材料等工业。建设了三千个工业企业、两千多个电站、二十三座新城市和一百多个工人村。
    目前在哈萨克斯坦建立了九个经济区。共和国政府正致力于进一步发展具有全联盟意义的经济部门。哈萨克共和国所开采的铅占全苏联的78％，铜占57％，锌占67％，镉和钨占58％。它是世界上铬、钒、铁、铜、铅、锌的储量最丰富的国家之一，钼、煤、石油、锰及其他稀有和放射元素的储量也在苏联居于主要地位。不久前在库斯坦奈州发现的一个铁矿产地，储藏量在一百亿吨以上，为鲁尔区已知储量的两倍半。
    不久的将来，哈萨克斯坦将成为全苏有色金属、铁、钢、电力、煤和石油生产的强大基地之一。钢的产量在1956年已达1945年的五十一倍，当正在建设的卡拉干达冶金工厂投入生产时，它将生产更多的钢、铁和钢材。煤的产量1956年为革命前的三百五十倍。在大图尔加发现的煤田的基础上，正在兴建新的采煤企业。这里煤的蕴藏量为四百三十亿吨，比卡拉干达煤区多得多。电力生产现在约达七十亿度，为1913年的五千五百倍。石山口水电站已经发电，现在正在建设第二个大水电站——布赫塔明水电站。
    在哈萨克斯坦，基本建设和工业产量将以比全苏联更高的速度发展和提高。一些巨大的重工业单位的建设已经展开。卡拉干达冶金工厂（或称哈萨克斯坦的马格尼托格尔斯克）正在兴建，索科罗夫斯克—萨尔巴伊采矿选矿联合企业、最大的机器制造企业——巴夫洛达尔的联合收割机制造厂、别特罗巴夫洛夫斯克轧钢设备工厂、齐姆肯特的水泥厂以及其他工业单位的建设，都在顺利进行。巴夫洛达尔的联合收割机制造厂投入生产以后可以年产六万架谷物联合收割机，比全苏1955年出产的还要多一万二千架。
    哈萨克斯坦的农业也发生了巨大的变化。最近四年大力进行了开垦荒地的工作，垦出了两千万公顷新地，相当于英国、奥地利、比利时、荷兰和西德谷物播种面积的总和。今年又开垦了一百万公顷新地。播种面积已达到二千七百八十万公顷，而1953年仅为九百八十万公顷。党和人民的意志把哈萨克斯坦变成了全苏最重要谷仓之一。
    国营农场在共和国的农业生产中占着很大比重。这里有八百多个国营农场，三百四十个机器拖拉机站，这些机器拖拉机站拥有二十万八千台拖拉机，约八万五千台联合收割机以及许多其他农业机器。
    谷物经济发展的成就为畜牧业的发展开辟了灿烂的前途。共和国的农业劳动者热烈响应党和政府关于在最近几年使肉类、牛奶和油脂按人口平均的产量赶上美国的号召，决定到1960年使肉类的产量增加为1956年的两倍半，猪肉为六倍半，牛奶为二倍，羊毛为二点七倍。羊的头数将增为两倍多，牛将增加为一倍半。到1960年将至少拥有四千万只羊，年产羊毛十万吨以上。
    共和国的交通运输状况随着工农业的发展而大大改善了。截至1956年底，铁路线长度已达近一万公里，而在1913年只有两千公里。仅在1955年一年，就在垦荒地区铺设了一千多公里铁路。此外，现在正在顺利地建设阿克斗卡到国界的铁路，这条铁路被人们称作友谊之路，它将大大促进苏联和中华人民共和国之间的友好经济联系。
    文化的空前高涨是哈萨克人民在苏维埃政权年代取得的重大胜利之一。去年在国民经济部门工作的专家的人数为1941年的五倍。现在，在哈萨克斯坦有二十五所高等学校，建立了哈萨克共和国科学院。不久前还建立了哈萨克农业科学院。共和国共有一百二十七个科学研究机关。在革命前，哈萨克斯坦共有各种普通学校约两千所，只有五万七千九百个学生。现在这种学校共有九千多所，有一百三十五万人在其中学习；其中有五十万哈萨克儿童用本民族语言学习。1956年我们用哈萨克文出版了六百三十九种书籍，共约八百万册。现在在哈萨克斯坦出版的报纸比比利时、奥地利、智利、乌拉圭、秘鲁、阿根廷、墨西哥、玻利维亚、哥伦比亚九个国家还要多，而这些国家的人口却十倍于哈萨克斯坦。
    哈萨克共和国同友好的邻邦中华人民共和国有绵长的共同边界。哈萨克斯坦和中国人民的文化联系一年比一年更加发展和巩固。
    苏维埃哈萨克斯坦的劳动人民把自己的一切成就归功于共产党和苏联政府，归功于各族人民的牢不可破的友谊。他们紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，用在国家政治生活、维护和平的斗争、经济和文化建设中的新成就来迎接伟大的十月革命节。哈萨克人民认为，在完成我们党的第二十次代表大会的历史性决议、在建设共产主义的共同事业和巩固我们亲爱的祖国的威力的事业中增加自己的贡献，是他们首要的爱国主义职责。
