Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch: A mass-based new upsurge in production is gradually taking shape in industrial enterprises across various regions. Since August of this year, many factories and mining enterprises in various regions have successively launched rectification movements. After fully mobilizing the masses of workers to air their views freely, hold great debates, and resolutely carry out large-scale rectification and reform, the broad masses of workers have received the most profound self-class education, and their political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm have soared to unprecedented heights. With the resolution of many internal contradictions within enterprises, the relationships between enterprise leaders and the masses of workers, and between the masses of workers and technical and management personnel, are closer and more united than ever before. Various new atmospheres have begun to appear in enterprises. Many reports from various regions indicate that many enterprises that launched the rectification movement earlier and more effectively have already begun to see a mass-based production upsurge. Some enterprises that are currently undergoing rectification are also beginning to show signs of a production upsurge.

An important feature of the production upsurge that has emerged or is emerging in many factories and mining enterprises is that the broad masses of workers are enthusiastically responding to the call of "no delay in both rectification and production" with practical actions, and have excellently fulfilled their production plans. In Liaoning Province, most enterprises that have launched the rectification movement completed their production plans for October better than any previous month. The total output value of state-owned industrial enterprises in the province exceeded the plan by 6% in this month, an increase of 15.3% over the same period last year. The output plans for major products were also completed well, such as crude salt, which exceeded the target by more than 500,000 tons by the end of October, creating a record for the highest output in the province's history. Benxi Coal Mine failed to complete its production plan for three consecutive months in the third quarter, with a shortfall of more than 10,000 tons. Since the launch of the rectification movement in October, in addition to completing the plan, it has also overproduced more than 14,900 tons. The Iron Smelting Department of the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, which launched the rectification movement earlier, not only made up for the shortfall of 1,896 tons of pig iron in the first half of the year by the end of the third quarter but also overproduced 467 tons more than the increased production and savings plan. In October, it exceeded the new plan by another 990 tons. In the rectification movement at Suzhou Chemical Plant in Jiangsu Province, the plant's daily output increased from 40 tons to 50 tons. The truck workshop of the Xi'an Sanlun Vehicle Repair Factory's production plan for November was 97 vehicles, but the workshop increased it to 100 vehicles. From the 1st to the 10th, this workshop should have completed 33 vehicles, but it actually completed 35 vehicles. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant also increased its production of steel by 4,000 tons in October. The product quality of many factories and mining enterprises has also improved during the rectification movement. The number of cotton cloth defects in the weaving workshop of the Xi'an No. 4 State-owned Cotton Factory decreased by 70% to 80%. The first-class cotton cloth increased from 97.3% before the rectification movement to 98.32%. The broken yarn in the fine spinning workshop of this factory decreased by more than half in October for the A, B, and C shifts. In October, the standard yarn rate of thirteen cotton textile factories in Shanghai reached 100%. The silk first-class product rate of the Third Silk Factory of the Southwest Silk Company was 94.69% in September and increased to 97.36% in October. The old workshop of the silk weaving workshop created a new record for quality with a 100% first-class product rate.

Workers in many industrial enterprises in various regions have actively created outstanding achievements in production and construction during the rectification movement to welcome and promote the arrival of a production upsurge. In the industrial enterprises in Liaoning Province that have launched the rectification movement, many workshops, teams, and individuals with good production, good safety, and good labor discipline have emerged. Many teams and individuals have created new records for daily output. On October 23rd, the workers of Fushun Open-Pit Coal Mine created five new records for coal mining, coal washing, and transportation. On this day, the mine's raw coal output exceeded the highest daily output since this year, producing 58% more raw coal than the plan for that day. The new record of 1,600 tons of raw coal produced per day in the mine's deep pit increased by 210% compared to the daily output in 1955 when it was first put into production. The production quotas of the First Blooming Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel in October were constantly being broken by the workers. From September 23rd to November 3rd, the factory has seen eight new records for daily output by teams. The new record of exceeding the plan by 14% created on October 27th was the highest since the factory started operations. The actual monthly output of the factory was 4,900 tons of steel billets more than the highest monthly output in the past. The output of the Xi'an Coal Mine of Liaoyuan Mining Bureau had never reached the design level in the past two years. After the start of the rectification movement, the output gradually increased, and at the end of September, a new record of more than 3,000 tons of daily output was created, reaching the design level for the first time. In the first week of extensive airing of views and debates in the large-scale steelmaking workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, the workers broke through various production targets, shortening the smelting time of each furnace of steel by 21 minutes and creating a new record for daily output.

During the rectification movement, the broad masses of workers in many factories and mining enterprises in various regions also actively put forward a large number of rationalization proposals, thereby satisfactorily solving some key technical problems in production in the enterprises. In Changchun City, the number of rationalization proposals put forward by workers in the Automotive Tool Factory, Shoe Factory, and Rubber Factory No. 8 in September increased by 4.2 times compared to August. From October 6th to 22nd alone, the workers of Shenyang Smelting Plant put forward 240 rationalization proposals, more than one and a half times that of September. In Xiaqiao Mine of Jiawang Mining Bureau, workers put forward a total of 412 rationalization proposals in September and October, an increase of 281 over July and August. Most of these rationalization proposals are aimed at key issues in production technology or production management. After adopting the suggestion of using a 2.8-meter cut-off disc to cut coal proposed by the workers in the No. 1 Coal Mining Area of Xiaqiao Coal Mine, the efficiency increased from more than 9 tons to more than 10 tons. The four electric welding machines in the cold working workshop of Shenyang Transformer Factory have been unusable for a long time because the equipment performance was not properly understood. During the rectification period, after welder Qu Zhenchang and young technician Ma Yunlu actively assisted the leaders in solving this key problem, the trial use began in late October. The quality of the welded products was very good, and the work efficiency was also increased by three to four times. The suggestion of "shortening the acceptance time for the delivery of hoisting machines" put forward by veteran worker Yao Guiqing in the fitter workshop of Dalian Shipyard greatly improved work efficiency. In the past, it took one hour to accept one unit, but after his own experiment, it only took 15 minutes. The Huanggu District Freight Car Repair Factory, based on the suggestions of the workers, formulated a production reform plan, changing the current fixed-station production organization form to an assembly line production organization form. After this plan is realized, the factory's total output value can be increased by at least 30.8%, the labor productivity can be increased by 27.5%, and more than 200 new freight cars can be produced and more than 600 freight cars can be repaired in one year.

At present, the Party committees and leaders of industrial enterprises in many regions are closely combining the rectification work and taking various measures to promote the rapid arrival of a production upsurge.

    整改高潮促成生产新高潮
    广大职工在大鸣大放中出色地完成了计划
    新华社26日讯　一个群众性的生产新高潮正开始在各地工业企业中逐渐形成。从今年8月份以来，各地许多厂矿企业相继开展整风运动，经过充分发动职工群众大鸣大放和大争大辩，坚决进行大整大改，广大职工受到了一次最深刻的自我阶级教育，政治热情和劳动热情空前高涨；随着企业内部许多矛盾的解决，企业领导方面和工人群众之间，工人群众和技术人员、管理人员之间的关系，比以往任何时期都要亲切、团结。在企业中开始出现了各种新的气象。各地提供的许多情况表明，许多整风运动开展得较早、较好的企业，已经开始出现了群众性的生产高潮；一些正在进行整风的企业，也开始出现生产高潮的苗头。
    许多厂矿企业出现或正在形成生产高潮的一个重要特点，是广大职工用实际行动热烈响应“整风、生产两不误”的号召，出色地完成了生产计划。辽宁省大部分开展整风的企业，10月份的生产计划比过去任何一月完成得都好。全省国营工业企业在这个月中超额6％完成总产值计划，比去年同期提高15．3％。主要产品的产量计划也完成得较好，如原盐10月底超额五十多万吨，创造了全省历史最高产量的纪录；本溪煤矿第三季度连续三个月没有完成生产计划，欠产一万多吨，10月份开展整风以来，除完成计划外还超产了一万四千九百多吨。开展整风较早的北京石景山钢铁厂炼铁部，第三季度末不但弥补了上半年欠产的一千八百九十六吨生铁，而且比增产节约计划超产了四百六十七吨，10月份又比新计划超产了九百九十吨。江苏省苏州化工厂在整风中，全厂日产量从四十吨提高到五十吨。西安市三轮车辆修理工厂的货车车间，11月份的生产计划是九十七辆车，车间提高到一百辆。从1日到10日，这个车间应该完成三十三辆，实际完成了三十五辆。太原钢铁厂在10月份也增产了四千吨钢铁。许多厂矿企业的产品质量在整风中也提高了。西安国棉四厂织布车间棉布拆痕疵点减少了70％至80％；棉布一等品由整风前的97．3％，提高到98．32％。这个厂细纱车间的坏纱，10月份甲、乙、丙三班平均降低了一半以上。10月份，上海市有十三个棉纺织厂的棉纱标准品率达到百分之百。西南蚕丝公司第三丝绸厂丝绸正品率，9月份是94．69％，10月份就提高到97．36％。织绸车间老工场创造了正品率百分之百的质量新纪录。
    各地许多工业企业的职工，在整风中纷纷创造优异的生产建设成绩，来迎接和促进生产高潮的到来。辽宁省开展整风的工业企业中，出现了许多生产好、安全好、劳动纪律好的车间、班组和个人；很多班组和个人，创造了日产量的新纪录。抚顺露天煤矿的工人在10月23日创造了采煤、选煤和运输的五个新纪录。这一天全矿的原煤产量超过今年以来的最高日产量，比当天计划多生产了58％的原煤。这个矿深部坑创造的日产原煤一千六百吨的新纪录，比刚投入生产的1955年日产量提高了210％。鞍钢第一初轧厂10月份的生产定额不断被工人们突破。全厂从9月23日到11月3日，先后出现过八次班组日产量新纪录。10月27日创造的超计划14％的新纪录，是这个厂开工以来最高的一次。全厂月实际产量比过去最高月产量还多四千九百吨钢坯。辽源矿务局西安煤矿两年来始终没有达到设计水平，整风开始后产量逐渐上升，9月末创造了日产量三千多吨的新纪录，第一次达到了设计水平。重庆钢铁公司大型炼钢车间在大鸣大放的第一周，职工们就突破了生产上的各项指标，每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短二十一分钟，创造了日产量的新纪录。
    各地许多厂矿企业的广大职工，在整风中还积极提出大量合理化建议，从而使企业中存在的一些生产技术关键问题得到圆满的解决。长春市汽车随车工具厂、制鞋厂、橡胶八厂等三个单位，职工们在9月份提出的合理化建议比8月份增加了四点二倍；沈阳冶炼厂仅10月6日到22日，全厂职工就提出二百四十件合理化建议，超过9月份的一倍半；贾汪矿务局夏桥矿9、10两月，职工们共提出四百十二件合理化建议，较7、8两月增加了二百八十一件。这些合理化建议，大部分是针对生产技术或生产管理方面的关键问题提出的。夏桥煤矿采煤一区采纳职工提出的用二点八公尺截盘截煤的建议后，效率由九吨多提高到十吨多。沈阳变压器厂冷作车间的四台电焊机，长期因为掌握不准设备性能不能使用。整风期间，经焊接工瞿振昌和青年技工马云鹭等主动协助领导上解决了这一关键问题后，10月下旬开始试用，焊接的产品质量很好，还提高了工作效率三倍到四倍。大连造船厂钳工车间老工人姚贵卿提出的“缩短验收扬货机交货时间”的建议，提高工作效率很多。过去验收一台要一小时，经他自己试验，用十五分钟就行了。皇姑屯货车修理工厂根据职工们的建议，制定了生产改革的方案，把目前固定台位的生产组织形式，改为流水作业的生产组织形式。这个方案实现以后，工厂的总产值至少能提高30．8％，劳动生产率提高27．5％，一年可以多生产新货车二百多辆，多修理货车六百多辆。
    目前，不少地区的党委和工业企业的领导方面，正在密切地结合整改工作，采取各种措施促进生产高潮的迅速到来。
