　　Not Eating Idle Rice in the City, Returning to the Countryside to be a Farmer
　　Family Members of Beijing State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1 Enthusiastically Return to the Countryside
　　They say: There are three benefits to family members returning to the countryside: increasing the rural labor force; reducing the burden on the city; and increasing family income.

　　(Our newspaper’s reporter Sun Guang reports) On the 21st, the trade union of the State-Owned Beijing First Cotton Textile Factory held a general meeting of employees' family members to bid farewell to 150 households, a total of 272 family members, returning to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production. In the future, even more people will return to the agricultural production front.

　　After the start of the rectification campaign, "difficulty in obtaining housing" has almost become a universal cry from the employees of Beijing First Cotton Textile Factory. Some even complained that the leadership was not building enough houses. In order to clarify the reasons why there were not enough houses for the employees, the factory's Party committee organized them to broadly discuss this issue, and also organized some employees to specifically understand the housing situation at the real estate department. Through investigation and presenting the facts, many employees realized that the reason there were not enough houses was not because too few were being built, but rather the result of natural population growth, especially the blind influx of rural populations into the city. In this year alone, the factory has had 800 employees' family members move in from the countryside, requiring approximately 260 rooms. After extensive discussion, the employees unanimously recognized that: to solve the housing problem, it is necessary to control births and mobilize employees' family members to return to the countryside. Subsequently, the factory convened a meeting of employee representatives to deeply discuss the issue of mobilizing family members to return to the countryside. At the meeting, the representatives cited a lot of materials to prove that the rapid increase in the urban population greatly increased national expenditure, and also brought many difficulties to the lives of the employees. Finally, the meeting made a resolution, calling on all employees to respond to the call of the Party and the state, and vigorously mobilize family members to return to their hometowns for production. After the meeting, each workshop also organized propaganda teams, convened symposiums for employees' family members, and visited families to explain the reasons for returning to their hometowns for production.

　　Many employees' family members believe that family members returning to the countryside can increase the strength of agricultural construction, alleviate the tension in urban public utilities and material supplies, and also increase the income of employee families, so they actively responded to the call of the employee representative meeting. Wang Youzhen, an air conditioning worker in the former General Machinery Department, had a wife who used to work very well in the countryside and was also a member of the Communist Youth League. After the wage reform increased income two years ago, Wang Youzhen brought his wife to live with him. Now, they already have three children, and live on a monthly salary of 60 yuan, making life somewhat tight. This time, Wang Youzhen felt that allowing a person who is capable of labor to live idly in the city is not beneficial to himself or the country, so he actively mobilized his wife to return to the countryside. His wife was also very willing to return to the countryside to produce well. The two of them also made a plan for their future life. Some employees' younger brothers and sisters used to come to the city from the countryside, preparing to find work in the city; this time, the down-transfer of cadres and the mobilization of family members to return to the countryside greatly educated them, changing their view that "there is no future in the countryside," and they all actively requested to return to the countryside.

　　In the beginning, some employees were unwilling to let their family members return. Some were afraid of the hardship of the countryside; others said that their parents were old and unable to work, and so on. Some family members even said: "Marry a chicken, follow a chicken; marry a dog, follow a dog; marrying a worker means entering the city." After the employee masses launched debates targeting these thoughts, many people changed their minds. Liu Deqi of the fine yarn workshop used to raise many difficulties and was unwilling to let his family members return to the countryside, and his wife did not want to go either. After Liu Deqi changed his mind, he also persuaded his wife. Now, the two of them have issued a challenge, one wants to strive to become an advanced producer, and the other wants to strive to become an agricultural model.

　　In the past, many people applied for houses, preparing to bring their family members; now, they have also withdrawn their original applications.

    不在城里吃闲饭　回乡做个种田人
    北京国棉一厂职工家属踊跃回农村
    他们说：家属回乡有三好：增加农村劳动力；减轻城市负担；增加家庭收入。
    本报讯　记者孙光报道：21日，国营北京第一棉纺织厂工会召开了职工家属大会，欢送一百五十户、二百七十二名家属回乡参加农业生产。今后还将有更多的人回到农业生产战线上去。
    整风开始以后，“要房难”几乎成了北京第一棉纺织厂职工的普遍呼声。有人还埋怨领导不多盖房子。这个厂的党委为了让职工们弄清楚房子不够住的原因，组织职工对这个问题普遍展开讨论，并且组织一些职工到房产科具体了解了住房情况。通过调查和摆事实，很多职工认识到房子不够住并不是因为盖少了，而是人口自然增长，特别是农村人口盲目流入城市的结果。仅今年一年，这个厂就由农村迁来八百名职工家属，需要住房二百六十间左右。经过广泛讨论，职工们一致认识到：要想解决房子问题，应该节制生育和动员职工家属回乡。接着，厂里召开职工代表大会，深入讨论了动员家属回乡的问题。会上，代表们引用了许多材料，证明城市人口增加快，大大增加了国家开支，同时也给职工生活带来许多困难。最后大会做出决议，号召全体职工响应党和国家的号召，大力动员家属回乡生产。会后，各车间还组织宣传队，召集职工家属座谈，访问家属，向他们讲清了回乡生产的道理。
    许多职工家属都认为，家属回乡可以增加农业建设力量，缓和城市公用事业和物资供应等方面的紧张状况，还可以使职工家庭增加收入，因而积极响应了职工代表大会的号召。前总机械部空调工人王有珍的妻子过去在农村劳动得很好，又是个青年团员。前年工资改革增加收入以后，王有珍把他妻子接来同住。现在，他们已经有三个孩子，每月靠六十元工资过活，生活有些紧张。这次，王有珍感到让一个能劳动的人住在城里吃闲饭，对自己对国家都不利，就积极动员他妻子回乡。他妻子也很愿意回农村好好生产。他们俩还订了今后的生活计划。有些职工的弟弟、妹妹过去由农村进城，预备在城里找工作；这次干部下放和动员家属回乡使他们受到很大教育，改变了“农村没出息”的看法，都积极要求回农村去。
    开始的时候，有些职工不愿意让家属回去。有的怕农村苦；有的说父母年纪大，回去干不了活，等等。有的家属甚至说：“嫁鸡随鸡，嫁狗随狗，嫁工人就是为了进城。”职工群众针对这些思想展开辩论以后，很多人都转变了。细纱车间刘德启过去曾经提出许多困难，不愿让家属回乡，他妻子也不想走。刘德启思想转变以后，把他妻子也说服了。现在，他们俩提出挑战，一个要争取当先进生产者，一个争取当农业模范。
    过去，不少人申请要房子，准备接家属；现在，他们也撤回了原来的申请。
