Learning from the Soviet Union's Scientific Spirit of Valuing Medical Culture
Vice President of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhu Lian

The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution brought boundless fortune to all mankind. In the past forty years, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people, following the principles of Marxism-Leninism, have staunchly overcome all obstacles and difficulties, and have made a series of great contributions to the happy life of mankind. These great contributions continue to expand and develop, and countless facts, like the morning sun in winter, warmly and radiantly shine on the world, recognized by all good people. Here, I will only use the Soviet Union's active promotion and research of our country's acupuncture therapy as an example to illustrate that the Soviet Union's scientific spirit of valuing our medical culture is worth learning from. The combination of advanced Soviet medicine and ancient Chinese medicine will make a significant contribution to human health care.

Acupuncture therapy is a historical heritage in our medical culture, which has been circulating among the people since the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods and has always been welcomed by the broad masses of working people. Since the vigorous promotion by the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, acupuncture therapy has further gained a wide mass base. At the same time, with the increasingly consolidated unbreakable friendship and cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union, acupuncture therapy has also been introduced to the Soviet Union, and the work has been carried out rapidly and effectively.

The Soviet medical community did not despise acupuncture therapy because it was old and outdated and the tools were simple. On the contrary, they attached great importance to it. In 1951, after the People's Daily published news and articles about promoting, researching and organizing acupuncture therapy, Professor Konovalov, the then Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, wrote to express the Soviet medical community's great interest in ancient Chinese medicine. Professors Bikov, Tetov, Polderev, and Kochergin, who successively served as the leaders of the Soviet expert group in the Chinese Ministry of Health, all expressed their heartfelt support for the policy and guidelines of "uniting Chinese and Western medicine, inheriting and carrying forward the motherland's medicine" proposed by the CPC Central Committee and the government at many meetings. They also made special reports on their views on ancient Chinese medicine. Since 1951, Soviet Minister of Health Kovrigina, Uzbek Minister of Health Sagatov, and a medical delegation headed by Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences Vice President Klotkov, as well as some Soviet medical experts, have made it a point to visit the Acupuncture Research Institute of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine when they visited China. They unanimously believed that acupuncture therapy is not only a method of treating diseases, but also has a profound theory, and it is necessary to further study it. For example, Minister Kovrigina said: Acupuncture therapy is ancient Chinese medicine, which has been tested by countless Chinese people and has its rich content and unique advantages in treating diseases, which is beyond doubt; China is the homeland of acupuncture therapy, and the Chinese medical community has the responsibility to spread it to all countries in the world in an easy-to-understand language, and more importantly, to study its principles of treating diseases to guide other countries; the Soviet medical community also has the responsibility to learn acupuncture therapy and help with scientific research. At that time, she entrusted Professor Polderev, the leader of the Soviet expert group working in the Chinese Ministry of Health, to organize all Soviet medical scientists in Beijing to study and research acupuncture therapy. Since then, the Soviet Ministry of Health, through the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement, sent experts to specialize in studying acupuncture (and planned to send more experts successively). Dozens of Soviet medical scientists in Beijing have also established close ties with the Acupuncture Research Institute, understanding and mastering the basic operations of acupuncture treatment. For example, Soviet consultant of Beijing Medical College – pathologist and physiologist Fyodorov, Soviet neurologist of Beijing Hospital Lushetsky and many other professors, really participated in clinical treatment work in the Acupuncture Research Institute, and helped the doctors of the Acupuncture Research Institute obtain a lot of theoretical knowledge of pathophysiology and neurology, as well as many animal experimental methods.

It is not difficult to see that the Soviet Union's emphasis on medical culture stems from the ideological viewpoint of historical materialism. They not only attach importance to it politically and ideologically, but also put it into practical action without hesitation. This scientific spirit of treating medical culture is worth learning from us.

The Soviet people have a high degree of political and cultural accomplishment, and their spirit of humbly learning and selflessly studying hard has given us a deep impression and enlightenment. For example, the three medical scientists sent by the Soviet Ministry of Health last year to investigate and study acupuncture – Professor Dekotchenskaya, Associate Doctor Usova, and Osinpova – were tasked with spreading and promoting Chinese acupuncture therapy in the Soviet Union, and they were scheduled to complete more than a dozen heavy tasks within a few months. Not to mention other things, just to skillfully use acupuncture techniques to treat more than 30 kinds of diseases, it is necessary to first familiarize themselves with the 700 acupuncture points on the human body, and it is not easy to pronounce the names of more than 370 points in Beijing pronunciation. However, with their tireless efforts day and night, they finally successfully completed various tasks. They not only strictly paid attention to the study of technical methods and bits and pieces of experience, but also paid more attention to the theoretical study of the mechanism of acupuncture treatment. They carefully listened to our introduction of the ancient Chinese medicine's theory of "Yin and Yang" balance and the theory of "tonification and sedation" of acupuncture treatment, analyzed and studied the basic concepts of the principle of acupuncture acting on "stimulating and adjusting the regulating and controlling functions of the nervous system" that we proposed from clinical experience; and in clinical treatment, they put forward evaluations of certain laws at any time in combination with the actual situation, and discussed with Chinese doctors. For example, regarding acupuncture as a treatment for insomnia, they believed that this was very consistent with the production of normal internal inhibition pointed out by the Ivan Pavlov theory; for example, regarding the ancient acupuncture operation of "tonification and sedation" method, we combined clinical phenomena and its general effects and summarized it as "inhibition method" and "excitation method." After carefully observing the patient's condition and the patient's reaction during clinical treatment, they believed that this was very consistent with Vikinsky's functional and inter-ecological physiological theory. In short, they believed that the prospect of scientific research on acupuncture is broad, and its wide application in various departments – physiology, pathology, anatomy, histology, and other basic and clinical medicine disciplines – has unquestionable benefits.

The reason why they do not despise the ancient acupuncture therapy and its simple tools, but consider it precious; the reason why they not only attach importance to it politically and ideologically, but also delve into reality; the reason why they not only attach importance to technical operation and bits and pieces of experience, but also pay more attention to theoretical research is precisely because they follow the teachings of Marxism-Leninism: "If we take the standard of practice as the basis of epistemology, then we will inevitably get materialism." Only by treating everything with historical materialism and dialectical materialism can we have a true scientific viewpoint.

Under the leadership and support of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union, our acupuncture therapy has been gradually and widely promoted and researched in the Soviet Union. Since the return of the above-mentioned three medical scientists to their country, for more than a year, acupuncture training courses for doctors have been opened in the large-scale Moscow Central Institute for Advanced Medical Studies, Moscow Botkin Hospital, Leningrad Institute of Neuropsychiatry, etc. In these institutions, as well as in more than 20 medical institutions such as the Eighth Clinic of Moscow University and the Twenty-sixth Clinic of the Frunzensky District, acupuncture clinical treatment has been carried out, and good results have been obtained for many diseases. While carrying out acupuncture clinical treatment and training acupuncture talents, acupuncture research has been carried out more widely on the basis of the combination of theory and practice. For example, in the Leningrad Institute of Neuropsychiatry, an acupuncture laboratory and an electrophysiological laboratory for acupuncture research were established in February this year. Experts in neurology, psychiatry, electrophysiology, and clinical medicine participated in the research. They have all mastered the basic operations of acupuncture therapy, and use the latest scientific instruments, either to conduct animal experiments or to cooperate with clinical treatment, to study acupuncture from various specific issues. In terms of animal experiments, research on the effect of acupuncture on blood has been carried out; the observation of the neural reflex function of acupuncture "inhibition method" and "excitation method" has also been carried out, and it has been preliminarily discovered that the two basic methods are different in the length of the reflected wave. In cooperation with clinical treatment, using a variety of new instruments, it is possible to observe the effects of acupuncture treatment on the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and muscle movement of patients at the same time. At the same time, it is also possible to observe the effects of acupuncture on the central nervous system, respiration, body temperature, and sweating of patients. The above-mentioned research work, whether conducting animal experiments or cooperating with treating patients, has been carried out with great seriousness and care in observing the various systems of the body before, after, and during acupuncture. Therefore, the results of the research are accurate and reliable. Recently, the Soviet Ministry of Health also decided to establish an acupuncture research institution in the Academy of Medical Sciences, which will be attended by medical experts from various disciplines. In just over a year, the Soviet Union has promoted our acupuncture therapy so rapidly and effectively. In addition to fully proving the strong leadership of the Communist Party and the government, the ideological guidance of Marxism-Leninism, and the superiority of the socialist system, what else can we say?

With the vigorous advocacy and support of the Party and the government, acupuncture therapy has made great progress in China. However, due to the limitations of certain instruments, equipment, and theoretical and technical knowledge, it is necessary to make many efforts to further systematize and scientize acupuncture therapy and improve its scientific theory to guide clinical practice. We are grateful to many Soviet experts for their concern for our acupuncture research work, which has given us more confidence in research. For example, the opinion of physiologist Professor Fyodorov on the research of Chinese doctors on the effect of acupuncture on guinea pigs on tuberculosis, and the detailed explanation of neurologist Professor Lutzsky from the principles of spinal cord gray matter and pathological anatomy, are beneficial to our research.

We can fully imagine that in the solid friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party with Marxist-Leninist thought as the basis, with the theoretical guidance of the advanced Pavlovian theory of the Soviet Union and the guidance of advanced scientific research methods, acupuncture therapy will be further developed, more systematically and highly scientific, and new theories will be put forward for the prevention and treatment of human diseases. Its future is bright and splendid.

    学习苏联重视医学文化的科学精神
    中医研究院副院长　朱琏
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，带给全世界人类以无限的幸运。在已往的四十年中，苏联人民在共产党领导下，遵循着马克思列宁主义的原则，坚强不屈地摧毁了一切障碍，克服了种种艰难，对人类幸福生活作出了一系列的伟大贡献，这种伟大贡献现在仍继续不断地扩大与发展着，数不清的事实，像冬天早晨的太阳一样，温暖而光芒四射地照耀着世界，被一切善良的人们所公认。在这里我仅以苏联积极推行和研究我国针灸疗法为例，说明苏联重视我国医学文化的科学精神值得我们学习。苏联先进医学结合我国古代医学又将对人类保健事业作出重大贡献。
    针灸疗法是我国医学文化中的历史遗产，它在春秋战国时期就已流传于民间，历来为广大劳动人民所欢迎。自从中国共产党和人民政府大力提倡后，针灸疗法进一步获得了广泛的群众基础。同时，随着中苏两国牢不可破的友谊日益巩固、文化交流日益发展，针灸疗法也已传到苏联，而且迅速有效地开展了工作。
    苏联医学界没有以针灸疗法古老陈旧和工具简便而鄙视，相反地予以十分重视。当1951年，人民日报登载了有关推行与研究整理针灸疗法的消息和文章之后，不久，当时的苏联医学科学院副院长柯诺瓦洛夫教授就来信表示苏联医学界对中国古代医学极感兴趣。先后担任我国卫生部苏联专家组组长的比阔夫教授、捷多夫教授、波尔德列夫教授、柯切尔金教授等，在许多会议上都曾表示衷心拥护中共中央和政府提出的“团结中西医，继承与发扬祖国医学”的政策方针，并且也作过对中国古代医学看法的专门性的报告。1951年以来，苏联保健部长科夫里金娜、乌兹别克保健部长萨加托长和以苏联医学科学院副院长克洛特科夫为首的医学代表团和一些苏联医学专家们，在来我国访问时，也一定要到中医研究院针灸研究所重点参观，他们一致认为针灸疗法不仅是一种治病的方法，而且它具有深奥的理论，颇有进一步研究的必要。例如科夫里金娜部长说：针灸疗法是中国的古代医学，它已经过无数中国人民的考验，有其丰富的内容和治病的独特长处，是无可置疑的；针灸疗法的祖国是中国，中国医学界有责任把它以容易理解的语言传播到世界各国，更重要的是研究它的治病原理，以指导别的国家；苏联医学界也同样有责任学习针灸疗法并帮助进行科学研究。她当时委托在我国卫生部工作的苏联专家组长波尔德列夫教授，负责组织所有在北京的苏联医学家学习和研究针灸疗法。此后，苏联保健部通过中苏两国科学技术合作协定，又派来了专门考察和学习针灸的专家（而且还拟陆续再派专家来）。在京的数十位苏联医学家也都同针灸研究所建立了密切的联系，了解和掌握了针灸治病的基本操作，如北京医学院苏联顾问——病理生理学家费奥德洛夫、北京医院苏联神经学家卢谢茨基等许多教授，都切切实实地到针灸研究所参加临床治疗工作，并帮助针灸研究所的医生们获得了许多病理生理学和神经学方面的理论知识以及许多动物实验的方法。
    不难看出，苏联对于医学文化的重视，是从历史唯物主义的思想观点出发的。他们不仅仅在政治上思想上给以重视，同时也毫无犹豫地见诸实际行动。这种对待医学文化的科学精神，是值得我们学习的。
    苏联人民具有高度的政治修养和文化修养，那种虚心学习和忘我地刻苦钻研的精神，给了我们深刻的印象和启发。例如去年苏联保健部派来考察和学习针灸的三位医学家——教授德柯琴斯卡娅、副博士乌索娃和奥辛波娃，她们负有在苏联传播推行中国针灸疗法的使命，预定在几个月内要完成十多项繁重任务。别的不说，单以熟练针灸技术重点地用于治疗三十多种疾病来说，首先必须把人体上七百个针灸穴位摸熟，三百七十多个穴名要用北京音讲出，就不是轻易的事了，可是在她们夜以继日的辛勤努力下，终于胜利地完成了各项任务。她们不仅严格地注意技术方法和点滴经验的学习，而且更注意针灸治病作用机制的理论钻研。她们细心地听取我们介绍我国古代医学的“阴阳”平衡论和针灸治病的“补泻”论，分析研究我们从临床经验中提出的针灸作用于“激发和调整神经系统的调节机能和管制机能”的治病原理的基本概念；并且在临床治病中，随时结合实际情况提出某些定律的评价，同中国医生们讨论。如对针灸可治失眠症，她们认为这很符合伊凡·巴甫洛夫学说所指出的正常内抑制的产生；又如对古代针灸操作的“补泻”法，我们结合临床现象及其一般性的效果归结为“抑制法”和“兴奋法”，当她们在临床治疗中仔细观察病情和病人的反应以后，她们认为这很符合维金斯基的机能性和间生态生理学说。总之，她们认为针灸的科学研究工作的远景是开阔的，广泛地应用于各个部门——生理、病理、解剖、组织及医学的其他基础学与临床学的各学科——更有不容置疑的好处。
    她们之所以不鄙视古老的针灸疗法及其工具简单、反认为是珍贵；她们之所以不仅在政治上思想上重视、而且切实地深入实际；她们之所以不仅重视技术操作和点滴经验、同时更注意理论钻研，这正是她们遵循马克思列宁主义的教诲：“如果把实践标准作为认识论的基础，那末我们必然地得到唯物主义”。也只有以历史唯物主义与辩证唯物主义去对待一切事物，才会有真正的科学观点。
    在苏联共产党和政府的领导与支持下，我国的针灸疗法已在苏联日渐地广泛推行和展开研究了。从上述的三位医学家回国以后，到目前为止，不过一年多时间，已在规模宏大的莫斯科中央医师进修学院、莫斯科包特金医院、列宁格勒神经精神病学研究院等处，都开办了医师针灸训练班，并且在这些机构中以及莫斯科大学第八分诊所、弗沦津斯区第二十六分诊所等二十多个医疗机构中，都开展了针灸临床治疗工作，并且对不少疾病获得良好效果。在展开针灸临床治疗与培养针灸人才的同时，在理论与实际相结合的基础上较广泛地开展了针灸研究工作。例如，列宁格勒神经精神病学研究院内，今年2月间成立了针灸实验室和研究针灸的电气生理实验室，参加研究工作的有神经病学、精神病学、电气生理学以及临床医学等各方面的专家，他们都已掌握了针灸疗法的基本操作，并且用最新式的科学仪器，或作动物实验，或配合临床治疗，从各个具体问题入手进行针灸的研究。在动物实验方面，已作了针灸对血液影响的研究；也已进行了针灸“抑制法”和“兴奋法”手法的神经反射机能的观察，初步发现两种基本手法在反射波的长短上是有所不同的。在配合临床治疗方面，利用多种新式仪器，可以观察到针灸治疗时对于患者的中央神经、心脏血管、肌肉运动等三个方面在同一个时间内所产生的影响。在同一个时间内，也可以观察到针灸对于患者的中央神经、呼吸、体温、出汗等四个方面所产生的影响。上述这些研究工作的进行，不论作动物实验或是配合为病人治病，在针灸进行前、后以及进行的当时，对机体各个系统都十分严肃细心地进行了观察，因此，研究所得的结果是确切可靠的。最近，苏联保健部还决定在医学科学院成立针灸研究机构，将有各科医学专家参加。在短短的一年多时间内，苏联把我国的针灸疗法竟然推行得如此迅速有效，除了充分证明由于共产党和政府的强有力的领导、马列主义的思想指导以及社会主义制度的优越性之外，我们还有什么话可以说明呢？
    在党和政府的大力提倡和支持下，针灸疗法在国内已有很大发展，但是由于某些仪器设备和理论技术知识等条件的限制，进一步使针灸疗法系统化、科学化，提高其科学理论来指导临床实际，还要作许多努力。我们感谢许多苏联专家对我国针灸研究工作的关怀，他们使我们在研究方面更有了信心。如生理学家费奥德洛夫教授对我国医生用荷兰鼠作针灸对肺结核的影响的研究的意见，和神经学家鲁茨斯基教授从脊髓灰白质类的原理上及病理解剖上作了详尽的解释，对我们的研究是有益的。
    我们完全可以设想，在中苏两国坚固的友好合作之中，在共产党领导下以马列主义思想为基础，有苏联先进的巴甫洛夫学说理论指导和先进的科学研究方法指导等的援助，将使针灸疗法进一步发展，更有系统的更高度的科学化，对人类疾病的预防与医疗上提出新的理论，其前途是光明灿烂的。
