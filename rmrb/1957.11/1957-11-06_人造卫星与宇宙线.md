Artificial Satellites and Cosmic Rays
Researcher, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhang Wenyu

In just one month, the Soviet Union has successfully launched two artificial satellites. The weight of the second satellite is more than six times that of the first, and its height is about one and a half times greater (referring to the maximum distance from the ground), while its speed is still about the same. In terms of science and technology, this astonishing achievement is truly unprecedented. Geophysics, meteorology, cosmic ray research, astrophysics, and other sciences will greatly benefit from this. Here, I will discuss the possible impact of the Soviet Union's successful launch of artificial satellites on cosmic ray research.

Cosmic rays are a type of radiation that is constantly emitted from outside the Earth. Cosmic rays observed on the ground include protons, neutrons, electrons, photons, and various types of mesons. However, most of these are "secondary" particles produced by the interaction of the initial cosmic ray particles with the Earth's atmosphere. By studying cosmic rays, we can obtain three different kinds of knowledge: first, the relationship between the origin of cosmic rays and celestial bodies (including the distribution of the Earth's magnetic field); second, the interaction forces of elementary particles and the structure of matter; and third, the effects of cosmic rays on living organisms and other substances.

Up to now, the highest and most reliable cosmic ray observations have been conducted at an altitude of 30 kilometers. The orbit of the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite had a minimum altitude of 400 kilometers and a maximum of 1,000 kilometers, while the second satellite exceeded 1,500 kilometers at its highest point, which is almost 20 to 50 times higher than 30 kilometers. What are the benefits of observing at such a high altitude? Will studying cosmic rays on artificial satellites lead to revolutionary results?

There are two relatively important aspects of cosmic ray research. One is the large and distant aspect, which is the study of primary cosmic rays and the origin of cosmic rays. This is a problem related to astronomy. The other is the small aspect, which is the problem of the interaction forces between elementary particles, that is, using cosmic rays to study the interaction forces of elementary particles.

Now let's look at the relationship between altitude and cosmic ray research. First, let's talk about the first question: primary cosmic rays are cosmic rays before they enter the atmosphere. We usually use balloons to observe them. The observed components include protons (hydrogen nuclei), d-particles, and heavier nuclei, with many different types. Based on observations at an altitude of 30 kilometers, we can draw a conclusion that there are no electrons or neutrons in primary cosmic rays. However, there is still a lot of gas between the altitude of 30 kilometers and the altitude of the Soviet artificial satellites, so we don't yet know whether the components observed on artificial satellites will be the same as what we currently know. What is important is that the study of the origin of cosmic rays completely depends on the information on the situation and composition of primary cosmic rays, as well as the relationship with solar activity and information on astrophysical phenomena. The observation results on artificial satellites are likely to be completely different from the observation results at an altitude of 30 kilometers, so the view on the origin of cosmic rays may also be completely different. Where exactly do cosmic rays originate? What is the mechanism of their origin? What is the mechanism of their acceleration? Based on current observation results, there are several possible answers. The reason is that everyone is still uncertain about the observation of primary cosmic rays, and the observation of astrophysical phenomena is not accurate enough, so the view on the origin of cosmic rays cannot be determined. We can obtain a lot of new knowledge from artificial satellites, so we can also obtain more definitive knowledge about the origin of cosmic rays.

Now let's talk about the second aspect. What role can artificial satellites play in using high-energy particles of cosmic rays to study the interaction forces between particles? The higher the altitude, the higher the energy and intensity of cosmic ray particles. Now, at an altitude of 30 kilometers, some particles have energy as high as 10 to the 20th power electron volts. It is possible to obtain high-energy particles of 10 to the 30th power electron volts at artificial satellites.

Now, the world's largest accelerator can only accelerate particle energy to 10 to the 10th power electron volts. If we want to build an accelerator based on the current principles of accelerators to accelerate particle energy to 10 to the 14th power electron volts, then this accelerator would have to be as big as the Earth.

Why do we need to study the interaction force between particles at such a high altitude away from the ground? There are two main types of interaction forces, one is nuclear interaction. This interaction force is different from ordinary interaction forces. Its range of action is very short. It only appears when particles are very close to each other. The composition of the atomic nucleus relies on this kind of interaction force. If the law of this kind of interaction force can be found, then the problem of the structure of the atomic nucleus can be truly understood. The range of action of this force is only 10 to the minus 13th power to 10 to the minus 14th power centimeters. It is difficult for the energy of ordinary particles to bring particles close to each other. The higher the energy, the closer they can get. This is based on the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics; the greater the momentum, the smaller the uncertain region. The other main type of force is electromagnetic force (that is, long-range force). This force can occur even when two particles are very far apart. This force is not very relevant to the structure of the atomic nucleus, but we are interested in it theoretically. We have a relatively clear understanding of the long-distance action of electromagnetic force, but no one dares to say whether the current quantum electrodynamics can still be used to explain it when it is very close. This problem is closely related to field theory. If two particles with extremely high energy can collide with each other, then this problem will have the hope of being solved. How to obtain high-energy particles? The higher you are from the ground, the better. If it is possible to obtain 10 to the 30th power electron volts on Soviet artificial satellites, this will be of great benefit to the study of the nature of short-range electromagnetic force action. These two kinds of forces are closely related to the structure of matter. It can be seen that, whether viewed from a large aspect or a small aspect, altitude is of great importance to the study of cosmic rays.

In the history of physics, every time there is a major new achievement in science and technology, physics closely follows with epoch-making developments. Technological inventions and new discoveries in physics or other sciences are inseparable. Now, the Soviet Union's artificial satellites are one of the greatest achievements in science and technology in history (or perhaps the single greatest). Therefore, it is predictable that there will be amazing progress in many disciplines in the near future. There is also a point that now, the general public regards cosmic rays as a purely scientific field like physics, just as people regarded nuclear physics before 1940. The success of the Soviet artificial satellites will likely change people's views on cosmic rays and high-energy physics in the future.

    人造卫星与宇宙线
    中国科学院物理研究所研究员　张文裕
    在短短的一个月中，苏联发射成功了两个人造卫星。第二个卫星的重量为第一个卫星的六倍多，高约为一倍半（指离地面最大距离），而速度仍约与前同。在科学技术上，这个惊人的成就实在是史无前例。地球物理、气象学、宇宙线、天文物理等科学，将因此而得到巨大的发展。这里我谈一谈苏联发射人造卫星的成功对于宇宙线研究可能引起的影响。
    宇宙线是由地球外面经常不断地发射来的一种辐射。在地面上所观察的宇宙线，有质子、中子、电子、光子和各种不同的介子等。但其中大多数的种类，是由最初的宇宙线粒子与地球大气发生作用而产生的“二次”粒子。由于研究宇宙线，人们可以得到下面三种不同的知识：第一，宇宙线的起源与天体的关系（包括地磁的分布）；第二，基本粒子相互作用力与物质的构造；第三，宇宙线对生物和其他物质所发生的影响。
    到现在为止，最高而且可靠的宇宙线观察是在三十公里高的地方进行的。苏联第一个人造卫星的轨道最低在四百公里，最高到一千公里，第二个卫星最高超过一千五百公里，差不多比三十公里要高二十到五十倍。在这样高的地方观察有什么样的好处呢？是不是在人造卫星上研究宇宙线会得到革命性的结果呢？
    宇宙线的研究有二个方面比较重要，一个是大的和远的一方面，就是研究原始宇宙线与宇宙线的起源。这是与天文学有关的问题。另一个是小的方面，就是基本粒子互相之间的作用力的问题，也就是用宇宙线来研究基本粒子的作用力。
    现在来看高度与宇宙线研究的关系。先谈第一个问题：原始宇宙线就是在进入大气前的宇宙线，我们通常用气球来观察，观察到的成分有质子（氢原子核），d粒子，还有更重的原子核，种类很多。根据三十公里高处的观测材料，可以得出一个结论，就是原始宇宙线里没有电子和中子。但是三十公里高处与苏联人造卫星的高度之间，还有很多气体，所以还不知道在人造卫星上观察到的成分是否会与现在我们所知道的成分相同。重要的是，宇宙线起源的研究完全要依赖原始宇宙线的情况和成分的资料，以及与太阳活动的关系和天文物理现象的资料。在人造卫星上的观察结果很可能与三十公里高处的观察结果完全不同，因此对宇宙线起源的看法也就可能完全不同。宇宙线到底在什么地方发生？发生的机构怎样？加速的机构怎样？根据现在的观察结果来作推测，有好几种可能的答案。原因是大家对原始宇宙线的观测还不确定，对天文物理现象的观测，也不够准确，因此对宇宙线起源的看法也不能够确定。从人造卫星可以得到很多新的知识，所以关于宇宙线起源问题也可以得到更确定的知识。
    现在谈第二个方面。在利用宇宙线的高能粒子来研究粒子间相互作用力问题时，人造卫星可以起什么作用？高度愈高，宇宙线粒子的能量和强度也愈高。现在在三十公里高处观察，有的粒子能量高到101020电子伏。在人造卫星那里可能得到101030电子伏的高能粒子。
    现在世界上最大的加速器只能把粒子能量加速到1010电子伏，如果要根据目前用的加速器的原理造个加速器把粒子能量加速到1014电子伏，那末这个加速器就要像地球一样大了。
    为什么要在离地面这样高的地方来研究粒子与粒子间的作用力呢？作用力主要有两类，一类是核作用，这个作用力与普通的作用力不同，它的作用程很短，只有当粒子与粒子很近时才显出来。原子核的构成就是靠了这种作用力。这种作用力的规律能够找到，那末原子核构造问题就可以真正了解了。这种力的作用程只有10－13到10－14厘米，一般的粒子能量很难使粒子与粒子靠到这样近。能量愈高才可以靠得愈近，这是根据量子力学测不准的原理；动量愈大，测不准的区域愈小。另一类主要的力是电磁力（也就是长程力），两个粒子很远也能发生这种力。这种力与原子核构造并没有很大关系，但在理论上我们对它有兴趣。我们对电磁力的远距离作用了解得比较清楚，但很近时是否仍可以用目前的量子电动力学解释，谁也不敢讲，这个问题与场论的关系很大。如果能够使两个能量极高的粒子相碰撞，这个问题也就有希望能够解决。怎样得到高能粒子呢？只有离地面愈高愈好。假使在苏联人造卫星上可能得到1030电子伏，这对短程电磁力作用性质的研究会有很大好处。这两种力与物质的构造都有密切的关系。可见，无论从大的方面看，或从小的方面看，高度对宇宙线的研究都有莫大关系。
    在物理学历史中，每次在科学技术上有重大的新成就时，物理学就紧跟着有划时代的发展。技术的发明和物理学或其他科学的新发现是分不开的。现在苏联的人造卫星是有史以来科学技术最大成就之一（或者说是唯一最大的）。因此，最近的将来，许多学科的惊人进展，是可以预言的。还有一点，现在一般人把宇宙线像物理学当作一种极纯粹的科学看待，有如在1940年以前人们看待原子核物理学一样。苏联人造卫星的成功，将来很可能会使人们对宇宙线和高能物理学的看法改变。
