Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 9th - Following the recent Mountainous Areas Conference in Jiangxi Province, relevant departments immediately took action to develop mountainous areas and support their construction.

Lin Bingnan, Deputy Director of the Provincial Forestry Department, led more than ten section chiefs, division chiefs, and engineering technicians to Yunshan in Le'an County the day after the conference to survey the base for establishing a forestry farm. After returning to the department on the 1st, he immediately held a meeting to specifically arrange the work of establishing seven state-owned forestry bases in 1958, determining to dispatch two hundred survey and management personnel to form seven work teams to survey the base for establishing the farms on seven mountains. The fourteen survey personnel sent to Xishan and Yunshan have already built sheds on the mountains and started work. According to the requirements of the Mountainous Areas Conference, the Provincial Highway Transportation Department recently determined to build twenty-one highways leading to eighteen mountainous areas during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and will start construction next spring on highways leading to Jinggang Mountain, Yunju Mountain, Zhanggong Mountain and other three new forestry bases. More than one hundred survey personnel surveying these routes can depart within days. The seven mountainous highways currently under construction have also accelerated their progress, striving to be completed by the end of this year. The Provincial Navigation Department is organizing personnel to go up the mountains to survey the conditions of mountainous rivers and dredge waterways.

In order to invigorate the economic life of the people in the mountainous areas, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently expanded the variety and quantity of local products to be purchased in the fourth quarter, and will organize a large number of personnel to go to remote mountainous areas to purchase local products. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also determined to organize two hundred young cadres to establish business institutions in seven mountains successively in the coming winter and spring, settling down on the mountains, engaging in supply and marketing work, and establishing rabbit, bee, and other animal breeding farms to carry out production labor. Six cadres have now been sent to rabbit farms to learn rabbit breeding techniques. The working group sent by the Provincial Department of Commerce to four key mountainous counties to investigate the prices of industrial and agricultural products returned to the department on the 4th, and is now starting to comprehensively study and adjust the prices of industrial and agricultural products in the mountainous areas. The 12 million yuan loan allocated by the state to Jiangxi this year for reclaiming and restoring oil-tea camellia mountains has been quickly distributed to the masses by the People's Bank system.

    江西省各有关部门
    积极开发山区支援山区建设
    新华社南昌9日电　江西省最近召开的山区会议结束后，各有关部门立即行动起来开发山区和支援山区建设。
    省林业厅副厅长林秉南在会议结束后的第二天，就带领十多名处长、科长和工程技术人员，到乐安县的云山去勘察建立林场的基地。他在1日回厅后，又立即开会具体布置1958年建立七个国有林业基地的工作，确定抽调二百名勘探和管理人员组成七个工作队，到七个山头去勘探建场基地。派到西山、云山去的十四名勘测人员已在山上搭起棚子，开始工作。省公路运输厅根据山区会议的要求，最近确定在第二个五年计划期内，修建通往十八个山区的公路二十一条，明春即动手修建通往井冈山、云居山、璋公山等三个新的林业基地的公路。勘测这些路线的一百多个勘探人员日内就可以出发。正在修建的七条山区公路也加快了进度，争取在今年年底建成。省航运厅正在组织人员上山勘测山区河流情况，疏浚河道。
    为了活跃山区人民的经济生活，省供销社最近扩大了第四季度收购土产品的品种和数量，并将组织大批人员到深远山区去收购土产品。供销社还确定组织二百名青年干部，在今冬明春陆续到七个山头建立营业机构，在山上安家，一面作供销工作，一面建立养兔、养蜂及其他动物的饲养场，进行生产劳动。现在已派出六个干部去养兔场学习养兔技术。省商业厅派往四个重点山区县调查工、农业产品价格的工作组，已在4日回厅，现在正着手全面研究调整山区工、农业产品价格的问题。今年国家拨给江西垦复油茶山的一千二百万元贷款，人民银行系统已经迅速发放到群众手中。
