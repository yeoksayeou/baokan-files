    Even with a Good Harvest, Thrift is Still Necessary
    This year, the Mukou Agricultural Cooperative in Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, had bumper harvests for all three seasons. This made the cooperative cadres extremely happy. They would go to restaurants and eateries in the market towns to eat and drink extravagantly, also buying wine, meat, and fish to bring back and eat. The cooperative chairman, Lu Mingqu, was even more carried away, saying with great pride, "A bumper harvest deserves a bumper harvest attitude!" Under his leadership, a beautiful assembly hall capable of accommodating over 800 people was built. In addition to consuming over 1,200 labor days and more than 27,000 jin of firewood, the assembly hall also cost 510 yuan in cash.
    The cooperative members had many complaints about this assembly hall. During the recent socialist debate, they raised numerous criticisms: some said they would welcome buying large castrated oxen; some said they would be happy if a water pump were purchased; some said that building this thing was really of little use and unnecessary; some said that the cadres are always promoting running the cooperative thriftily, but where is that principle now; some said that the cadres shouldn’t let the bumper harvest make them lose their minds.
    At the end of the year's distribution, the cooperative members were all happy that the cooperative had increased production this year and that they could increase their income, but the cooperative was overdrawn due to the construction of the assembly hall, and an average of more than 1.50 yuan had to be deducted per person. The cooperative members were all very angry.

    丰收也要勤俭
    江苏灌云县穆口农业社，今年的三季庄稼都获得大丰收。这下可把社干部们乐坏了，逢集就到街上馆子里大吃大喝，还要打酒割肉称鱼捎回来吃。社长陆明渠更乐昏了头脑，十分得意地说：丰收得有个丰收的气派。于是在他的主持下，盖起了一座漂亮的能容八百多人的大会堂。这座大会堂除耗费了一千二百多个劳动日和二万七千多斤柴草外，还花去现金五百一十元。
    社员们对这座大会堂很有意见。在最近的社会主义大辩论中，纷纷提出了指责：有的说如买大犍牛我们欢迎；有的说要是置抽水机我们高兴；有的说现在盖这个家伙用处实在不大也不必要；有的说你们干部整天宣传勤俭办社，现在这个原则放到那里去了；有的说你们干部不该让丰收乐昏了头脑。
    年终分配了，社员们都为社里今年增产自己能增加收入而高兴，可是社里却因盖大会堂而透支了，平均每口人要扣除一元五角多钱。社员们都很气愤。
