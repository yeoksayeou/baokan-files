Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Beijing Hospital, in order to facilitate patients' access to medical care, has decided to implement a three-shift (morning, afternoon, and evening) outpatient service system on a trial basis starting from the 18th. This is a major reform in the working system adopted by Beijing Hospital after the rectification movement entered the stage of focusing on rectification.

In the past, Beijing Hospital's outpatient hours were the same as those of other institutions, which caused many inconveniences for patients seeking medical treatment. During the rectification, based on the demands of many patients and after discussions among the staff of various departments throughout the hospital, the hospital leadership decided to implement a three-shift outpatient service system on a trial basis. Patients can register and see a doctor at the hospital's outpatient department at any time. Returning patients can also make appointments by phone to reduce waiting time. It was also decided to cancel the previous regulation of suspending outpatient services on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons to accommodate staff study, and outpatient services will be provided as usual on Sunday mornings and afternoons.

Through discussions on this major reform, all the staff of the hospital have further clarified the concept that hospital work should better serve patients, and they have expressed their willingness to continue to improve various other aspects of the hospital's work.

    北京医院整改中的重大改革
    实行门诊三班应诊制
    新华社17日讯　北京医院为了便利病人就医，决定从18日开始在门诊部试行上午、下午、晚间三班应诊制。这是北京医院在整风运动转入着重整改阶段以后，在工作制度上所采取的一次重大改革。
    北京医院过去门诊的时间和其它机关的办公时间相同，对病人就医有很多不便。在整风中，根据很多病人的要求，并经过全院各科室工作人员的讨论，医院领导上决定试行门诊三班应诊制。病人随时可以到医院门诊部挂号看病，复诊病人还可以通过电话预约，以减少候诊时间。并决定取消过去每星期三、六下午因照顾工作人员学习而停诊的规定，星期日上下午也照常应诊。
    全院工作人员通过对这一项重大改革的讨论，都进一步明确了医院工作要更好地为病人服务的观念，并纷纷表示要继续改进医院其它各方面的工作。
