    Shandong Intensifies Efforts in Checking Seedlings, Replenishing Seedlings, Watering, and Topdressing Fertilizer
    Strive for High-Yield Wheat Production on 20 Million Mu
    (By Our Newspaper) The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China's call for creating 20 million mu of high-yield wheat fields has been met with enthusiastic response from all parts of the province. Various localities have proposed plans for high-yield fields exceeding 20 million mu, and a surge of strengthening wheat field management has been initiated in many areas. Various regions have conducted extensive debates on the question of whether it will be possible to strive for a good wheat harvest next year. Many county, district, and township leaders personally cultivate experimental fields and assign cadres to summarize the experience of mass wheat production over large areas. In Fan County, after a heated debate at the three-level cadre meeting, the original plan of cultivating 60,000 mu of high-yield fields in the county was increased to 320,000 mu. Yanggu County has organized more than 3,500 county, district, township, commune, and team cadres to cultivate 6,000 mu of high-yield experimental fields (requiring an average yield of 690 jin per mu). The first and second secretaries of the county party committee personally took the lead, cultivating five mu of experimental fields in agricultural cooperatives, requiring a yield of over 800 jin per mu. According to preliminary statistics from the Provincial Department of Agriculture: Various localities across the province have proposed creating a total of 21.34 million mu of high-yield wheat fields, exceeding the province's plan by 1.34 million mu. At the recent provincial conference of agricultural activists, ten commune directors, including Xu Jianchun, proposed creating high-yield wheat fields with yields of 400, 600, and 800 jin per mu or more in their respective communes. This proposal has also been echoed by farmers throughout the province.
    In order to strive for increased wheat production next year, wheat field management activities such as checking seedlings, replenishing seedlings, watering, and topdressing fertilizer are very active in various places. In the Tai'an area, seedlings have been replenished in 80% of the wheat fields with missing seedlings. At present, watering wheat, applying topdressing fertilizer, and protecting seedlings are being vigorously strengthened in various places. In the Taiyangsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Huang County, in order to irrigate 2,600 mu of wheat once, 70% of the labor force is working in shifts every night, irrigating wheat in a manner of "the well never rests, even if the people do."

    山东加紧查苗补苗浇水追肥
    力争二千万亩小麦高额丰产
    本报讯　中共山东省委关于创造二千万亩小麦丰产田的号召，得到了全省各地的热烈响应，各地提出高额丰产田的计划已超过二千万亩，并已在许多地区掀起了加强麦田管理的热潮。各地围绕着明年能否争取小麦丰收等问题，进行了大辩论，许多县、区、乡领导干部亲自搞试验田和选派干部总结群众小麦大面积丰产经验。范县在三级干部会议上经过热烈辩论，由原计划全县搞六万亩丰产田提高到三十二万亩。阳谷县已组织县、区、乡、社、队干部三千五百多人，搞起六千亩（要求平均亩产达到六百九十斤）高额丰产试验田，县委第一、第二书记亲自带头，分别在农业社里搞了五亩试验田，要求亩产八百斤以上。据省农业厅初步统计：全省各地共计提出创造二千一百三十四万亩小麦丰产田，已超过省里的计划一百三十四万亩。在最近召开的全省农业积极分子会议上，徐建春等十位社主任提出分别在自己的社，创造亩产四百、六百、八百斤以上的小麦高额丰产田的倡议，也得到了全省农民的响应。
    各地为力争明年小麦增产，查苗、补苗、浇水、追肥等麦田管理活动，十分活跃。泰安专区在80％的缺苗麦田里补了苗。目前浇麦、追肥、保苗工作，各地正在大力加强。黄县太阳升农业社，为将二千六百亩小麦赶浇一次水，每晚有70％的劳力以歇人不歇井的办法轮班浇麦。
