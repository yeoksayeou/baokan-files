Xinhua News Agency, 18th: During the rectification campaign, the Ministry of Light Industry has already transferred 323 staff members downward, accounting for more than one-third of all staff. With the 204 people who will be transferred downward soon, the number of transferred personnel will account for 56.8% of all staff.

Among the staff members who have already been transferred downward are veteran cadres who joined the revolution in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, cadres promoted from workers, and college graduates who just graduated last year; there are bureau directors, section chiefs, engineering technicians, clerks, and service personnel. Among the 323 people who were transferred downward, Party members and Youth League members account for more than half, including 101 Party members. Most of the transferred personnel will work in state-owned or local enterprises, some will be responsible for establishing new factories, and some will directly participate in manual labor.

The transferred staff members are in high spirits. They generally expressed that they want to be "able to be cadres and able to be workers." Shi Tongxing, deputy section chief of the Planning Section, heard that he was going to be transferred downward, and in order to reduce the burden on his family, he sent his wife and children back to his hometown in Henan. Liu Zhendong, the former mail clerk of the General Office, wrote a letter after being transferred downward to Shenyang, saying that he likes the supply and marketing work he is now responsible for and that he will strive to study the business and become an expert in this work.

The phenomena of bloated organizations and overstaffing in the Ministry of Light Industry have been criticized by staff members since the beginning of the rectification campaign. After the rectification entered the third stage, staff members put forward many suggestions on streamlining the organization and improving the ministry's leadership over enterprises. After studying the opinions put forward by the masses, the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Light Industry put forward a plan to streamline the organization and transfer staff downward. According to this plan, some departments will be abolished and merged; some unnecessary businesses will also be streamlined. On this basis, the total number of staff members will be reduced from 927 to 400.

    既能当干部　也能当工人
    轻工业部已下放干部三分之一
    加上最近还要下放的人员将超过全部人数的一半
    新华社18日讯　轻工业部在整改中已经下放工作人员三百二十三人，占全部工作人员的三分之一强；加上最近将要继续下放的二百零四人，下放人员将占全部工作人员的56．8％。
    已经下放的工作人员中，有抗日战争初期参加革命的老干部，有工人中提拔的干部，也有去年刚毕业的大学生；有司局长、处科长、工程技术人员、职员和勤杂人员。在下放的三百二十三人中，党团员占半数以上，其中党员有一百零一人。下放人员中大部分人将到国营或地方企业工作，有人将担任建立新厂的工作，有人将直接参加体力劳动。
    下放的工作人员情绪很高，他们普遍表示自己要“能当干部也能当工人”。计划科副科长施同兴听说自己要下放，他为了减少家庭的牵累，已经把妻子和小孩送回河南老家。原办公厅收发刘振东下放到沈阳以后，最近写信来说，他很喜欢现在担负的供销工作，并且表示要努力钻研业务，成为这项工作中的能手。
    轻工业部机构臃肿、人浮于事的现象，从整风一开始就受到工作人员的批评。整风进入第三阶段以后，工作人员提出不少有关紧缩机构、改进部对企业的领导的建议。轻工业部党组研究了群众提出的意见后，提出了紧缩机构，下放工作人员的方案。根据这一方案，部分司局将要撤销合并；有些不必要的业务也将精简。在这一基础上，将全部工作人员由九百二十七人减到四百人。
