Comrades! On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, the Central Committee of the National Front, and all the people of Czechoslovakia extend their comrade's fighting salute to the Soviet people.
(Applause)
    The socialist revolution in Russia in 1917 laid the foundation for the first worker-peasant state in the world and fundamentally changed the fate of mankind. Under its influence, the exploited proletariat and oppressed people of all countries entered a stage of resolute struggle against the exploiters and for social and national liberation.
    The forty years of victorious struggle to realize the goals and ideas of the Great October Socialist Revolution, first transformed into reality, have fundamentally changed the face of the world. Today, one-third of mankind is building a new socialist and communist society. Socialist ideas have taken deep root in the minds and careers of working people all over the world. Ideals and hopes become socialist reality, and this reality is invincible in its vitality, truth, and nobility.
    The Soviet Union's construction of a socialist society, the transformation of a backward agricultural country into a powerful socialist country with highly developed industry and large-scale agricultural production, the unprecedented scale of education, science, and culture, and the role and prestige of the world's first socialist country – all this is the result of the continuous realization and development of the program formulated by Lenin. (Applause) This is the result of the Soviet people's heroic labor, devoting all their selflessness, wisdom, perseverance, and enthusiasm to the realization of this historically significant cause. This is the result of the powerful, purposeful political and organizational work and ideological unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This is the victory and triumph of Marxism-Leninism, which has enabled the Soviet Union to become the most advanced and progressive country in the world in terms of industry and technology, and this country is leading a powerful and unified socialist camp with more than 900 million people. All this proves the power of thought, vitality, invincibility, and unstoppable development of our doctrine.
    The example of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the achievements of the Soviet people have had a revolutionary impact on workers all over the world, as well as the people of all dependent and colonial countries. The establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic is also a result of the Great October Revolution. Following the example of the Bolshevik Party, we established the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, which resolutely led the people to struggle to overthrow the capitalist system. After the Soviet Union's world-historically significant victory over fascist Germany, the working class of our country also seized power. (Applause) Forming an alliance with the Soviet Union and joining the socialist camp has given us a strong guarantee of freedom and independence for the first time in the history of our people.
    The current task of our people is to victoriously complete the socialist construction of our country. The conditions and circumstances we are in are much more favorable than those the Soviet Union was in at the time. We have been able to rely on the rich experience of the Soviet people and their Communist Party, on the assistance provided by the Soviet Union and friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union, on the fraternal countries of the socialist camp, and on the ideologically united international revolutionary workers' movement. The experience of socialist construction in Czechoslovakia fully proves the international significance of the Soviet experience in socialist construction. The achievements we have made in socialist construction prove that the working people of our country support the policies of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and firmly stand on the position of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. (Applause)
    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union further developed the ideas of Marx, Engels, and Lenin in the current situation, and added new strength to our struggle to build a socialist society. The historically significant resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU opened up new prospects for the development of socialism, the friendship and mutual understanding of peoples of all countries; and put forward and emphasized the possibility of peaceful coexistence between two different social systems. The creative development of Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet Union and the results of the 20th Congress of the CPSU are of great help to the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in proposing and implementing the task of completing the socialist construction of Czechoslovakia.
    Due to the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, all the people of Czechoslovakia have once again deeply realized the significance of friendly cooperation with the Soviet people. The Communist Party, the government, the National Front, and all the people of our country will continue to strengthen fraternal friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union, with all socialist countries, and with the people of all countries who are fighting for their social and national rights. Our people will never abandon the noble and profound correct ideas of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and will work and struggle tenaciously in the spirit of proletarian internationalism for the further development and victory of the ideas of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Our Communist Party has been and will always be a reliable force in the international revolutionary movement. (Applause)
    The principled Leninist policy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the vigorous strength of the Soviet system, and the close cooperation of all socialist countries with fraternal communist and workers' parties are the guarantee of new victories for socialism and peace. We know that in order to achieve this goal, we still need more joint efforts in the future, because there are still reactionary forces in the world who regard the achievements of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp as thorns in their side, and they are trying every possible means to harm our cause. But this cannot stop us. On the contrary, this will further strengthen our determination and will.
    The victorious forty years of the first socialist country are a harbinger of our communist future.
    Long live the fraternal cooperation of socialist countries and fraternal communist parties! (Applause) May the unified socialist camp become more consolidated and stronger in the future! (Applause)
    Glory to the invincible Soviet Union, glory to the Leninist Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the heroic Soviet people! (Applause)
    Glory to the forever vibrant doctrine of Marxism-Leninism! (Long and sustained applause)

    捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表团团长
    安托宁·诺沃提尼同志的讲话
    亲爱的同志们！捷克斯洛伐克共产党、捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府、民族阵线中央委员会以及捷克斯洛伐克全体人民，在伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的日子里谨向苏联人民致以同志的战斗敬礼。
  （掌声）
    俄国的社会主义革命在1917年奠定了世界上第一个工农国家，根本改变了人类的命运。在它的影响下，各国被剥削的无产阶级和被压迫的人民进入了反对剥削者及争取社会和民族解放的坚决斗争阶段。
    四十年来争取实现伟大十月社会主义革命第一次化为现实的目的和思想的胜利斗争，使得世界根本改变了面貌。今天已经有三分之一的人类正在建设新的社会主义和共产主义社会。社会主义的思想在全世界劳动人民的思想和事业中扎下了深根。理想和希望成为社会主义现实，这个现实在它的生命力、真实性和高尚性方面都是不可战胜的。
    苏联建成社会主义社会，落后的农业国变成具有高度发达的工业和大规模的农业生产的强大的社会主义国家，教育、科学和文化的空前未有的规模，世界上第一个社会主义国家的作用和威信——这一切都是始终不断地实现和发展列宁所制订的纲领的成果。（掌声）这是苏联人民把自己全部的忘我精神、智慧、毅力和热情贯注在实现这个具有世界历史意义的事业上的英勇劳动的成果。这是苏联共产党强有力的目的明确的政治工作和组织工作及其思想团结的成果。这是马克思列宁主义学说的胜利和凯旋，马克思列宁主义学说使得苏联有可能在工业和技术方面成为世界上最先进和进步的国家，这个国家正在领导着一个有九亿多人口的强大的统一的社会主义阵营。这一切证明了我们学说思想的力量、生气蓬勃、不可战胜性和不可遏止的发展。
    伟大十月社会主义革命的榜样和苏联人民的成就对全世界工人以及所有附属国和殖民地国家的人民发生了革命的影响。捷克斯洛伐克共和国的成立也是伟大十月革命的成果。按照布尔什维克党的榜样，我们成立了捷克斯洛伐克共产党，它坚决领导了人民为推翻资本主义制度而斗争。在苏联对法西斯德国的具有世界历史意义的胜利以后，我们国家的工人阶级也掌握了政权。（掌声）同苏联结成联盟和加入社会主义阵营使得我们在我国人民的历史上第一次得到了自由和独立的有力保证。
    我国人民的当前任务是：胜利地完成我们国家的社会主义建设，我们所处的条件和情况比苏联当时所处的条件和情况要有利得多。我们已经能够依靠苏联人民及其共产党的丰富经验、依靠苏联提供的帮助及同苏联的友好合作、依靠社会主义阵营兄弟国家以及依靠思想上团结一致的国际革命工人运动。捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义建设经验充分证明了苏联社会主义建设经验的国际意义。我们在社会主义建设方面所获得的成就证明了，我国劳动人民拥护捷克斯洛伐克共产党的政策，坚决站在马克思列宁主义的立场上、站在无产阶级国际主义的立场上。（掌声）
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在当前的情况下进一步发展了马克思、恩格斯和列宁的思想，并使我们在争取建成社会主义社会的斗争中增添了新的力量。苏共第二十次代表大会具有历史意义的决议为人类开辟了社会主义、各国人民友好和互相谅解思想的新的发展前途；并且提出和着重指出两种不同的社会制度的和平共处的可能性。马克思列宁主义在苏联的创造性发展和苏共第二十次代表大会的成果是对捷克斯洛伐克共产党提出和执行有关完成捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设的任务的一个重大帮助。
    由于伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年，捷克斯洛伐克全体人民又一次深刻地认识到同苏联人民友好合作的意义。捷克斯洛伐克共产党、政府、民族阵线和我国全体人民今后也将巩固同苏联、同全体社会主义国家以及同为争取自己的社会和民族权利而进行斗争的各国人民的兄弟友谊和联盟。我国人民永远不会放弃伟大十月社会主义革命高尚的和深湛正确的思想，并且将本着无产阶级国际主义原则的精神为伟大十月社会主义革命思想的进一步发展和胜利而进行顽强的工作和奋斗。我国共产党过去和今后永远将是国际革命运动的可靠队伍。（掌声）
    苏联共产党有原则的列宁政策、苏维埃制度的蓬勃力量、全体社会主义国家同兄弟共产党和工人党的密切的互相合作是社会主义和和平新的胜利的保证。我们知道，为了达到这个目标，今后我们还需要更多的共同努力，因为世界上还存在着反动势力，它们把苏联和社会主义阵营的成就看成眼中钉，它们千方百计地企图危害我们的事业。但是，这并不能阻止住我们。恰恰相反，这将更加巩固我们的决心和意志。
    第一个社会主义国家的胜利的四十年是我们共产主义未来的先兆。
    社会主义国家和兄弟共产党的兄弟合作万岁！（掌声）祝统一的社会主义阵营今后更加巩固，变得更加强大！（掌声）
    光荣属于战无不胜的苏联，光荣属于苏联的列宁共产党和英勇的苏联人民！（掌声）
    光荣属于永远生气蓬勃的马克思列宁主义学说！（经久不息的掌声）
