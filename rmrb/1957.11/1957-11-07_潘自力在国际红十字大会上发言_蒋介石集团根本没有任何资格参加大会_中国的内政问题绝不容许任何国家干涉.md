Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 6th: The full text of the speech by Pan Zili, head of the Chinese government delegation, at the afternoon session of the International Red Cross Conference on the 5th is as follows: Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates:

    The government of the People's Republic of China and the Red Cross Society of China have always been committed to the development of international peace, cooperation, and humanitarian causes. In international Red Cross activities, we have always made our own efforts and contributions in the spirit of friendly cooperation. The Chinese government delegation and the Red Cross Society of China delegation have come to New Delhi to participate in the 19th International Red Cross Conference for this purpose.

    In the week since the conference began, under the excellent chairmanship of Ms. Kaur, representatives from various countries have exchanged views on various issues and put forward many useful proposals. This proves that although the delegates from various countries attending the meeting have different views on many other issues, they can fully cooperate in developing humanitarian causes. However, it is regrettable that not all countries' delegations have come to participate in the conference in the spirit of friendly cooperation and for the purpose of developing humanitarian causes. Some delegations want to use this conference to achieve ulterior motives, which is obviously inconsistent with the purpose of the conference.

    At the conference on October 28th and 29th, the Chinese delegation pointed out that the United States was attempting to use this conference to create a political conspiracy of "two Chinas." After the Chinese delegation spoke on October 29th, although the US delegation repeatedly claimed that their participation in the conference was non-political, the essence of the US representative's speech and proposals was to blatantly carry out political activities that it dared not openly admit, attempting to create a situation of "two Chinas" at our conference. The US representative deliberately said that what he proposed was just a simple question of whether everyone has the right to be called by their own name. In fact, the problem is not just a matter of name. As the US representative himself later admitted, his purpose was to enable the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, which had long been overthrown by the Chinese people and completely lost any representation, to participate in this conference in the name of the so-called "Republic of China government."

    As you all know, the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the delegation of The Red Cross Society of China are official members of the International Red Cross Conference. This is a recognized fact. Since China's representation has been determined, what other question is there regarding Chinese representation? As Ms. Kaur, the Chairperson of the Conference, said, since the delegation from China has already attended, the issue does not exist. The U.S. representative stated that he was surprised by the Chairperson's statement, but in fact, this statement by the Chairperson not only conforms to the facts, but also expresses the opinions of many delegations participating in the conference.

    The US representative claims that the so-called "Republic of China government" is a contracting party to several Red Cross Conventions, and therefore, according to the "International Red Cross Rules," it is fully qualified to participate in this conference. Indeed, the so-called "Republic of China government" was once a contracting party to the 1929 Geneva Convention and signed the 1949 Geneva Convention, but that was before it was overthrown by the Chinese people. Everyone knows that after the old regime of any country is overthrown, its international rights are inherited by the new government. This is a universally recognized principle of international law. The former Qing government of China was also a contracting party to the 1864 Geneva Convention. According to the logic of the US representative, should the remnants of the Qing government also be invited to attend this conference? The US representative's attempt to use the so-called "Republic of China government" having been a contracting party to the Geneva Convention or having signed it as an excuse to argue that the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique is qualified to participate in this conference is completely untenable.

    Regarding this issue, I would also like to mention another opinion. Our Swiss colleagues argue that invitations to participate in the International Red Cross Conference should include all governments exercising power over territories to which the Geneva Conventions apply. We believe that this argument is also untenable. The Swiss delegation's proposal will face two situations. One situation is: the old regime has been replaced by a new government, but the remnants of the old regime are still entrenched in parts of the country exercising power. May I ask, should the old regime authorities exercising power in this region be invited to attend the conference? Another situation is: a minority opposition group in a country has established its own regime in parts of the country. This situation exists in some countries in the world. May I ask, should this minority opposition regime also be invited to attend the conference? Obviously, anyone with common sense understands that this cannot be done. Because doing so is not only a blatant interference in the internal affairs of the countries concerned, but also completely violates the International Red Cross Charter and the purpose of the International Red Cross Conference.

    Calling the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique the so-called "Republic of China government" or the so-called "Formosa government" is nothing more than creating a situation of so-called "two Chinas" on Chinese territory. Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. The reason why Taiwan has not yet returned to the jurisdiction of the Chinese government is entirely due to American interference and obstruction. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan. No matter how this issue is resolved, the issue between the Chinese government and the Taiwan authorities is China's internal affair, and no country is allowed to interfere. As the authorities of China's Taiwan Province, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has absolutely no qualification to participate in the conference, and the conference must not issue any form of invitation to it.

    The US representative attacked the People's Republic of China at the last conference, emphasizing that the United States does not recognize the People's Republic of China. In fact, all of this seems very ridiculous to us. The fact that China stands tall cannot be changed by the US government's attitude towards China. The problem now is not that the new China is eager to obtain American recognition, but that the US government is trying to make China recognize the American occupation of Taiwan and allow the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs. This is why the Chinese delegation will not sit down and meet with Chiang Kai-shek clique members under any circumstances, while the US representative is trying every means to get the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique into this conference to sit with the Chinese delegation. The US representative can think that way, but it is absolutely impossible.

    The delegation of the Government of The People's Republic of China and the delegation of The Red Cross Society of China request the conference to reject the American proposal, because this proposal not only attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs, attempts to create "two Chinas," but also completely violates the letter and spirit of the International Red Cross Charter. We also disagree with the Swiss proposal for the reasons stated above.

    Based on the position of safeguarding peace, developing humanitarian causes, and implementing the International Red Cross Charter, the Chinese delegation puts forward the following proposal, requesting the conference to discuss and adopt it. Our proposal is as follows:

    The 19th International Red Cross Conference,

    Noting the fact that the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of the China and the delegation of The Red Cross Society of China are official members representing China at the International Red Cross Conference,

    Considering that, according to Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the "International Red Cross Charter" and Item 2 of the "Conditions for Recognition of National Red Cross Societies," the local authorities and local Red Cross organizations of any country cannot participate in the International Red Cross Conference,

    Resolves that the authorities exercising power in China's Taiwan Province and the Red Cross organization there shall not attend the 19th International Red Cross Conference in any capacity.

    Mr. Chairman, the Swedish delegation suggests that this conference not vote on the US proposal. The Chinese delegation agrees with this suggestion. However, we oppose submitting the US proposal to the Standing Committee of the International Red Cross Conference for consideration when sending invitations in the future, because this proposal violates the "International Red Cross Charter."

    We believe that this conference should discuss and adopt the correct proposal put forward by the Chinese delegation to defend the International Red Cross Charter.

    潘自力在国际红十字大会上发言
    蒋介石集团根本没有任何资格参加大会
    中国的内政问题绝不容许任何国家干涉
    新华社新德里6日电　中国政府代表团团长潘自力在国际红十字大会5日下午会议上的发言全文如下：主席先生、各位代表：
    中华人民共和国政府和中国红十字会一向致力于国际和平、合作和人道主义事业的发展，在国际红十字活动中，也一向本着友好合作的精神作出自己的努力和贡献。此次中国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团就是为了这目的来到新德里参加第十九届国际红十字大会的。
    在大会开始以来的一星期里，在大会主席考尔女士的卓越主持下，各国代表就各项问题交换了意见，并且提出了许多有益的提案。这证明尽管参加会议的各国代表们在其他方面的许多问题上有着不同的见解，但是在发展人道主义事业上，是完全可以合作的。不过遗憾的是，并不是所有国家的代表团都本着友好合作精神和发展人道主义事业的目的前来参加大会的。有的代表团想利用这次大会来达到别有用心的目的，这显然是同大会的宗旨不符的。
    在10月28日和29日的大会上，中国代表团就曾经指出了美国企图利用本届大会制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋。在10月29日，中国代表团发言以后，美国代表团虽然一再声称他们参加大会是非政治性的；但是，美国代表发言和提案的实质却是露骨地进行它所不敢公开承认的政治活动，企图在我们的大会上制造“两个中国”的局面。美国代表故意地说他所提出的只不过是一个简单的问题，每个人是否有权用自己的名字来被称呼。其实问题绝不是一个名称问题，正如美国代表自己后来也承认了的一样，他的目的是要使早已被中国人民所推翻、完全丧失了任何代表性的台湾蒋介石集团在所谓“中华民国政府”的名义下参加本届大会。
    大家知道，中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团是国际红十字大会的正式成员。这是公认的事实。既然中国的代表已经确定了，那里还另外有一个什么关于中国代表的问题呢？诚如大会主席考尔女士所说，由于来自中国的代表团已经出席，问题并不存在。美国代表说对大会主席的话感觉惊奇，其实大会主席的这句话不仅符合事实，而且是表达了参加大会的许多代表团的意见的。
    美国代表声称，所谓“中华民国政府”是几个红十字公约的缔约国，因而根据“国际红十字细则”它完全有资格参加这个大会。不错，所谓“中华民国政府”曾经是1929年日内瓦公约的缔约国，并且在1949年日内瓦公约上签过字，但是，那是在它还没有被中国人民推翻以前的事。谁都知道，任何一个国家的旧政权被推翻以后，它的国际权利就由新政府所继承。这是全世界公认的国际法原则。中国的前清政府也曾经是1864年日内瓦公约的缔约国，根据美国代表的逻辑，难道清政府的残余分子也应该被邀请来出席本届大会么？美国代表企图拿所谓“中华民国政府”曾经是日内瓦公约的缔约国或在上面签过字作为借口来主张台湾蒋介石集团有资格参加这个大会，是完全站不住的。
    关于这个问题，我还想提一下另外一种意见。我们的瑞士同事主张，关于参加国际红十字大会的邀请，应该包括对适用日内瓦公约的领土施行权力的一切政府。我们认为这种主张也是站不住的。瑞士代表团的提案将要面对两种情况。一种情况是：旧政权已经为新政府所代替，但是旧政权的残余分子还盘踞在这个国家的部分地区施行权力，请问在这个地区行使权力的旧政权当局是不是应该被邀请出席大会？另一种情况是：一个国家内的少数反对派在该国部分地区建立了自己的政权。这种情况在世界上有些国家中存在着，请问这种少数反对派的政权是不是也应该被邀请出席大会？很显然，任何有常识的人都懂得是不能这样做的。因为这样做，不仅是对有关国家的内政的露骨干涉，而且也是完全违背国际红十字章程和国际红十字大会的宗旨的。
    把台湾蒋介石集团称为所谓“中华民国政府”也好，或者是所谓“福摩萨政府”也好，无非是要在中国领土上制造所谓“两个中国”的局面。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。台湾所以到现在还没有回到中国政府的管辖之下，完全是由于美国的干涉和阻挠。中国人民是一定要解放台湾的，不管这个问题如何解决，中国政府和台湾当局之间的问题是中国的内政问题，绝不容许任何国家干涉。作为中国台湾省的当局，蒋介石集团根本没有任何资格可以参加大会，大会也不能对它发出任何形式的邀请。
    美国代表在上次大会上对中华人民共和国进行了攻击，强调美国不承认中华人民共和国。其实，这一切在我们看来是非常可笑的。中国屹然存在的事实决不是美国政府对中国的态度所能改变的。现在的问题不是新中国急于取得美国的承认，而是美国政府力图使中国承认美国侵占台湾，容许美国干涉中国内政。这就是为什么中国代表团在任何情况下都不会同蒋介石集团分子坐在一起开会，而美国代表却想尽一切方法，要把蒋介石集团的代表弄进本届大会同中国的代表团坐在一起开会的缘故。美国代表可以这样想，但这是绝对办不到的。
    中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团要求大会否决美国的提案，因为这个提案不仅企图干涉中国内政，妄想制造“两个中国”，而且是完全违反国际红十字章程的文字和精神的。我们也不同意瑞士的提案。理由如上所述。
    中国代表团本着维护和平、发展人道主义事业、贯彻国际红十字章程的立场，提出以下提案，请求大会讨论和通过。我们的提案如下：
    第十九届国际红十字大会，
    注意到中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团是代表中国参加国际红十字大会的正式成员这一事实，
    考虑到，根据“国际红十字章程”第一条第二款和“承认各国红十字会条件”第二项规定，任何国家的地方当局和地方红十字会组织不能参加国际红十字大会，
    兹决议在中国台湾省行使权力的当局和该地的红十字组织不得以任何名义出席第十九届国际红十字大会。
    主席先生，瑞典代表团建议本届大会不就美国的提案进行表决。中国代表团赞成这个建议。但是，我们反对把美国的提案提交国际红十字大会常设委员会在将来发送请柬时加以考虑，因为这个提案是违反“国际红十字章程”的。
    我们认为，本届大会应该讨论通过中国代表团所提出的保卫国际红十字章程的正确的提案。
