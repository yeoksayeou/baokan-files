    How Zhenze County Carries Out the Year-Round Manure Accumulation Campaign	CCP Zhenze County Committee
    Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province, mainly produces rice, wheat, fruits, and is a multi-crop economic zone. Since liberation, the development of the cooperative movement has realized production reform and improved cultivation techniques, increasing the land multiple cropping index year by year, and the amount of fertilizer needed each year has also greatly increased. According to a survey: The average unit fertilizer application rate for grain crops in the county increased by 50% in 1955 compared to 1954, and nearly doubled again in 1956 compared to 1955. 1957 was basically the same as 1956. For fruit crops, not only did the unit fertilizer application rate double compared to before, but the fertilized area was also expanded. This has ensured the continuous development of agriculture and fruit production. The broad masses of cadres and people have learned from practice that increased production must rely on the leadership of the Party, and increased production must rely on accumulating more fertilizer - these two experiences.
    In recent years, the reason why our fertilizer has been able to basically meet the needs of production development is mainly due to fully mobilizing the masses, and carrying out a year-round manure accumulation campaign with leadership and planning, and highlighting the following measures: Exploiting Potential According to Local Conditions, Making Plans for Year-Round Manure Accumulation
    Fertilizer is the material basis for ensuring increased production, but to realize this increased production measure, there must be full preparation and comprehensive planning, and a year-round manure accumulation campaign must be carried out. In this regard, the county party committee learned from the lesson of insufficient fertilization area during the autumn planting in 1954 due to lack of prior planning. Since 1955, it has put forward the slogan of year-round manure accumulation and the requirements for each season's manure accumulation from top to bottom. And according to the county's favorable conditions such as being located near Taihu Lake, backed by mountains and hills, and abundant fertilizer sources, it requires all townships and cooperatives to put forward annual fertilization requirements and make year-round and seasonal manure accumulation plans according to different regions and different seasons while formulating annual production plans and seasonal plans. The methods of accumulating fertilizer in various places vary according to the busy and slack agricultural seasons. Generally, manure accumulation is combined with busy seasons (summer harvest and summer planting, autumn harvest and autumn planting), seized during slightly busy seasons (usually field management), and carried out as a concentrated effort during slack seasons. This basically achieves year-round manure accumulation. To carry out the year-round manure accumulation campaign, the leadership must have foresight and planning, be good at seizing gaps, and truly achieve that as soon as summer planting ends, immediately launch the accumulation of wheat fertilizer; as soon as autumn planting ends, immediately seize the large mature base fertilizer, so that one link is connected to another, and no link is missed. Within the agricultural cooperatives, there must also be full preparation and proper arrangements, namely: First, according to the busy and slack seasons, reasonably arrange labor and determine the proportion of manure accumulation and other production attendance; Second, check and prepare tools, repair what should be repaired, and add what should be added; Third, constantly study manure accumulation methods. Practice has proved that through making production plans, each cooperative makes manure accumulation plans in advance and makes full preparations, which is a prerequisite for carrying out year-round and intensive manure accumulation campaigns.
    Fully Mobilize and Enhance Understanding
    Timely Summarize and Conduct Evaluations
    The process of carrying out the year-round manure accumulation campaign is also a process of strengthening ideological education and establishing the concept of increased production. The masses in Zhenze County call summer-ripening wheat "rotten feet wheat" and do not need fertilization. And the fertilizer needed for large ripening also largely depends on commercial fertilizers, lacking the habit of increasing the accumulation of natural fertilizers. In addition, there are insufficient manure accumulation tools and few fertilizer sources, so many people have the idea that there is no fertilizer to accumulate. Based on this situation, the county party committee strengthened education in a timely manner, first summarized the high-yield experience of agricultural cooperatives such as Xiansheng and Xinghuo, and the broad masses of cadres and people initially established a strong concept that increased production must accumulate fertilizer. This laid an ideological foundation for fully carrying out the year-round manure accumulation campaign. At the same time, combined with positive education, it repeatedly explained that the country currently has few commercial fertilizers, which are far from meeting the needs of agricultural production development, so as to establish the idea that increased production relies on fertilizer, and fertilizer relies on self-sufficiency. In organizing the overall action of manure accumulation, the county party committee constantly checked and urged, and solved the cadres and masses' paralysis of thought. This enables the manure accumulation campaign to maintain regular and continuous development.
    In order to improve the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people in accumulating manure and continuously improve labor efficiency, in the manure accumulation campaign, the county party committee also conducted regular manure accumulation individual competitions through visits and evaluations, pushing the manure accumulation campaign to a climax step by step. In the red flag competition for manure accumulation in Yuexi Township, the youth production team took the lead in accumulating manure in the rain, which promoted the mobilization of all 250 boats in the township; 71 shock team members broke the ice and opened the port, and persisted in accumulating manure. They reflected: "The weather is cold, but the heart is warm"; "Thinking of socialism, I am full of energy, and I am not afraid of the cold." This has greatly promoted the development of the county's manure accumulation campaign.
    Combining Manure Accumulation, Manure Maintenance, and Manure Production
    Protect Fertilizer Sources and Improve Fertilizer Efficiency
    Production develops year by year, and the demand for fertilizer increases year by year, but the objective situation is the opposite, natural fertilizer sources are increasingly depleted, and the waterweeds in Taihu Lake are being harvested earlier and earlier, and less and less is being accumulated. In order to solve this contradiction, we must implement the combination of manure accumulation, manure maintenance, manure production, and manure protection, educate the masses to plan from a long-term perspective, protect and expand fertilizer sources, and ensure that future natural fertilizer sources can truly be inexhaustible and inexhaustible. Our measures are:
    1. In terms of manure maintenance. The first is to increase the raising of pigs and sheep. According to the characteristics of the region, the county party committee proposed the method of raising more sheep in the eastern and western mountainous areas and raising more pigs in the paddy field areas. Each cooperative adopted the method of allocating feed bases to members to grow more sweet potatoes and pumpkins, and helping members solve the problem of insufficient feed, in order to actively support the development of household pig raising as a sideline. And adopt the method of cooperative breeding and private raising, giving appropriate care to poor peasants raising pigs, and helping poor peasants solve economic difficulties. After the above measures were taken, the number of pigs and sheep in the county has now reached 72,000, an increase of 48% over the same period last year. The manure accumulation of each pig and sheep has also increased from an average of 20 loads in the past to 30 to 40 loads. Second, cultivate Taihu Lake waterweeds and protect Taihu Lake waterweed resources. The protection methods start from improving manure accumulation methods and delaying the time for harvesting grass. This year, we proposed changing raking grass (uprooting) to scything grass (cutting the head), and delaying the time for harvesting grass. This year, it generally starts before the beginning of summer, half a month to a month later than in previous years. This has a great effect on protecting fertilizer sources. Third, expand the green manure area and increase the unit yield of green manure. We insist on appropriately expanding the green manure area on the premise of not affecting grain production. And began to pay attention to strengthening green manure management, implementing timely sowing, increasing the amount of sowing, and doing a good job of ditching and frost prevention, so that the average yield per mu increased from below 2,000 jin to 3,000 jin.
    2. Manure production. Burning grass and river mud in ditches can fully rot the fertilizer and increase its effectiveness. In the past, only some members of Puzhuang and Xinqiao townships with Jiangyin origin adopted this method in the entire county. After cooperation in 1955, we summarized and promoted this experience. In that year, about 30,000 mu of land in the county adopted it, and in 1956 it had been promoted to about 100,000 mu, accounting for 75% of the paddy field area. Practice in the past two years has proved that this is an effective method to improve fertilizer efficiency. The masses reflected: "The fertilizer efficiency of grass pond mud is 20%-40% higher than that of grass river mud."
    3. Manure protection - strengthening manure management. In the past, our county was accustomed to open-air toilets, which not only affected hygiene, but also lost fertilizer efficiency and reduced quality. In the past two years, through education in various places, most of the manure tanks have been covered to prevent fertilizer volatilization and improve fertilizer quality. ××××
    In recent years, although our county's manure accumulation work has achieved certain results and explored some experiences, there are also some problems on the other hand. First, although our county has abundant fertilizer sources and the manure accumulation campaign has been carried out well, due to the rapid development of production, the measures of using fertilizer to maintain fertilizer have not been implemented enough and the actions are not strong, so the fertilizer sources are still insufficient. Second, some cadres and masses still have high expectations and low abilities for manure accumulation and rely on commercial fertilizers. For example, some cadres do not understand enough the spirit that manure accumulation work should "start from small things and aim high," so they look down on small things and cannot grasp big things in manure accumulation. At the same time, some cadres and masses believe that base fertilizer relies on their own accumulation, and top dressing relies on fertilizer powder. Due to the existence of this idea, it has also affected the development of the year-round manure accumulation campaign to some extent.

    震泽县怎样开展常年积肥运动	中共震泽县委会
    江苏震泽县主要出产稻麦、花果，是一个多种经济作物区。解放以来，由于合作化事业的发展实现了生产改制和改进栽培技术，使土地复种指数逐年提高，每年需要肥料的数量也大大增加。据调查：全县粮食作物的平均单位施肥量，1955年比1954年增加50％，1956年又比1955年增加近一倍，1957年和1956年基本相同。花果作物，不仅单位施肥量比前增加一倍，而且还扩大了施肥面积。这就保证了农业和花果生产的不断发展。广大干部和群众从实际中体会到，增产必须要靠党的领导，增产一定要多积肥料的二条经验。
    这几年来，我们肥料所以能够基本上满足了生产发展的需要，其主要经验是充分发动群众，有领导、有计划的开展了常年积肥运动，并突出抓住了以下几个措施：因地制宜挖掘潜力作出常年积肥打算
    肥料是确保增产的物质基础，但要实现这一增产措施，必须有充分准备、全面打算，开展常年积肥运动才行。在这方面，县委吸取了1954年秋种时因事先没有打算，施肥面积不足的教训，自1955年开始，就由上而下提出常年积肥的口号和每季积肥的要求。并根据本县滨临太湖、背靠山丘、肥源充沛等有利条件，要求各乡、社按照不同地区，不同季节，在制订全年生产规划和季节计划的同时，因地制宜提出全年施肥要求和订出常年、季节积肥打算。各地开展积肥方法，按照农事忙闲而变化，一般积肥是大忙（夏收夏种、秋收秋种）结合搞，小忙（平时田间管理）抓紧搞，闲时突击搞。这就基本上做到了常年积肥。要开展常年积肥运动，领导上必须有预见、有计划，善于抓空隙，真正做到夏种一结束，立即发动积麦肥；秋种一结束，就马上抓大熟基肥，这样才能一环套一环，环环不落空。在农业社内也必须充分准备、妥善安排，即：第一，要根据忙、闲季节，合理安排劳力，确定积肥和其它生产出勤比例；第二，检查准备工具，该修的修、该添的添；第三，经常研究积肥方法。实践证明：通过订生产计划，各社事先作好积肥打算，充分作好准备，是开展常年的和突击性的积肥运动的先决条件。
    充分发动提高认识
    及时总结开展评比
    开展常年积肥运动的过程，又是加强思想教育，树立增产观念的过程。震泽县群众称夏熟小麦为“麦烂脚”不需要施肥的。而大熟所需肥料，也大部依赖商品肥料，缺乏增积自然肥料的习惯。再加积肥工具不足，肥源又少，很多人有无肥可积的思想。县委根据这一情况，及时加强了教育，首先总结宪生、星火等农业社丰产经验，广大干部群众因此初步树立了要增产一定要积肥的强烈观念。这就为全面开展常年积肥运动打下了思想基础。同时，各地结合正面教育，又反复说明目前国家商品肥料少，还远远不能满足农业生产发展需要的情况，以此树立增产靠肥料，肥料靠自给的思想。在组织积肥全面行动中，县委又不断检查督促，解决干群麻痹思想。这就使积肥运动能保持经常地、不间断地开展起来。
    为了提高广大干部和群众的积肥积极性，不断提高劳动效率，在积肥运动中，县委又通过参观、评比，经常开展积肥单项竞赛办法，把积肥运动步步推向高潮。越溪乡在开展积肥红旗竞赛中，由于青年生产队带头冒雨积肥，推动了全乡二百五十条船只只出动；七十一个突击队员破冰开港，坚持积肥。他们反映：“天是冷的，心是热的”；“想到社会主义，浑身是劲，再冷也不怕。”这对全县积肥运动的开展，推动很大。
    积肥养肥造肥相结合
    保护肥源提高肥效
    生产年年发展，需肥量年年增加，但客观情况却是相反，自然肥源日益枯乏，太湖水草越捞越早，越积越少。为了解决这一矛盾，就贯彻积肥与养肥、造肥、保肥相结合，教育群众从长远利益打算，保护扩大肥源，保证今后自然肥源真正做到取之不尽，用之不竭。我们的措施：
    1、养肥方面。首先是增养猪、羊。县委根据本地区的特点，提出东、西山区多养羊，稻田地区多养猪的办法，各合作社采取划给社员饲料基地多种山芋、南瓜，帮助社员解决饲料不足问题，以积极支持家庭养猪副业的发展。并采取社繁私养办法，对贫农养猪给予适当照顾，帮助贫农解决经济的困难。采取了以上措施后，全县猪、羊数字目前已达七万二千头，比去年同期增长48％。每只猪、羊的积肥，亦由过去平均二十担，提高为三、四十担。其次，是培植太湖水草，保护太湖水草资源。保护办法，从改进积肥方法和推迟捞草时间着手，今年我们提出变耙草（连根拔）为耥草（割个头），并推迟捞草时间。今年一般在立夏前开始，比往年推迟半个月到一个月。这对保护肥源作用很大。再次，扩大绿肥面积，提高绿肥单位产量。我们坚持在不影响粮食生产的前提下，适当扩大绿肥面积。并开始注意加强绿肥管理，贯彻了及时播种，增加播种量做好开沟和防冻工作，使平均每亩产量从二千斤以下提高到三千斤。
    2．造肥。柴草河泥反塘，可以使肥料充分腐熟，增加肥效。过去在全县范围内只有浦庄、新桥两乡部分社江阴籍的社员采用这种办法，1955年合作化后，我们才总结推广了这个经验，当年全县约有三万亩田采用，1956年已推广到十万亩左右，占稻田面积75％。经二年来的实践证明：这是一个提高肥效的有效办法。群众反映：“草塘泥肥效比柴河泥要高20％—40％以上”。
    3．保肥——加强粪便管理。我县过去习惯露天厕所，这不但影响到卫生，同时也流失了肥效，降低了质量。这二年，各地通过教育，大部分粪缸都加了盖，防止肥分挥发，提高了肥料质量。××××
    几年来，我县积肥工作，虽获得了一定成绩，摸索了一些经验，但另一方面也存在一些问题。第一，虽然我县肥源充沛，积肥运动开展得较好，但由于生产飞速发展，以肥养肥措施还贯彻得不够，行动不力，所以肥源仍感不足。第二，部分干部和群众对积肥还存在眼高手低，依赖商品肥料的思想。如有些干部对积肥工作应从“小处着手，大处着眼”的精神领会不够，因此在积肥中小的看不上，大的抓不牢。同时，有些干群认为基肥依靠自己积，追肥要靠肥田粉。由于这一思想的存在，多少也就影响到常年积肥运动的开展。
