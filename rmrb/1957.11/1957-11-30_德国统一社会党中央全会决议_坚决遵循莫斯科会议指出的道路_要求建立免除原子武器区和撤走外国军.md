Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 29th: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) published on the 28th the resolution of its 34th Plenary Session regarding the results of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties in Moscow.

The resolution pointed out: The unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, and their will to carry out a common struggle for peace and socialism, is a great force that changes the balance of world power in a direction favorable to the camp of peace and socialism. All parties unanimously agree that the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union holds the leading position among the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries.

The Central Committee of the SED called on all party members and party leadership bodies at all levels to launch large-scale discussions on the declaration of the representatives' meeting, Comrade Khrushchev's report, the Peace Manifesto, and the appeal of the Supreme Soviet in national urban and rural organs and mass organizations, and to make decisions on practical measures.

The resolution called for the widespread development of a peace movement to strive for the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing and the unconditional prohibition of the manufacture and use of such weapons, making it a truly popular movement throughout Germany. The resolution stated: We demand the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Germany and European countries.

The resolution stated: Since these demands are consistent with the demands of members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and trade union members in West Germany, it should be possible for West German Social Democrats, Communists, and Christian workers to take united action.

The resolution stated: The declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries further enriches the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. We must explain the basic issues, the role of the Communist Party, and the superiority of the socialist system to the masses of people in both words and writing according to the meaning of the declaration, and combine this with the practice of building socialism in the German Democratic Republic.

The resolution pointed out: The achievements of the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other working people of the German Democratic Republic should be used as examples of socialist construction and socialist democracy, which will have an attractive force for the working class and working people of West Germany. Therefore, further expansion of the socialist production competition is the most important task at present.

The resolution also pointed out: It is necessary to widely publicize the experience of the Soviet Union's socialist struggle and victory, as well as the facts of communist construction, in the German Democratic Republic and in West Germany.

    德国统一社会党中央全会决议
    坚决遵循莫斯科会议指出的道路
    要求建立免除原子武器区和撤走外国军
    新华社柏林29日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会28日发表了第三十四次全体会议关于在莫斯科举行的共产党和工人党代表会议结果的决议。
    决议指出：所有国家的共产党和工人党的团结、它们为和平和社会主义而进行共同斗争的意志，就是使世界力量对比向着有利于和平和社会主义阵营的方向改变的巨大力量。所有的党都一致认为光荣的苏联共产党在各国共产党和工人党中间居于首位。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会号召全体党员和党的各级领导机构在全国城市和乡村的机关和群众团体中对代表会议的宣言、对赫鲁晓夫同志的报告、对和平宣言以及对最高苏维埃的号召展开大规模的讨论，并且作出关于实际措施的决定。
    决议号召广泛地展开争取立即停止原子武器和氢武器试验、无条件禁止制造和使用这类武器的和平运动，使它成为全德国真正的人民运动。决议说：我们要求建立免除原子武器区域和撤退在德国和欧洲各国的外国军队。
    决议说：由于这些要求同西德社会民主党党员和工会会员的要求是一致的，因此应该有可能使西德社会民主党人、共产党人和基督教工人采取一致的行动。
    决议说：社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言进一步丰富了马克思列宁主义的学说。我们必须用语言和文字按照宣言的意义向人民群众说明社会主义革命和社会主义建设的基本问题、共产党的作用和社会主义制度的优越性，并且同德意志民主共和国建设社会主义的实际结合起来。
    决议指出：应当通过德意志民主共和国工人、农民、知识分子和其他劳动人民取得的成就来树立社会主义建设和社会主义民主的榜样，而对西德工人阶级和劳动人民发生吸引力量。因此，进一步展开社会主义生产竞赛是当前最重要的任务。
    决议还指出：有必要在德意志民主共和国和在西德广泛地宣传苏联社会主义斗争和胜利的经验以及进行共产主义建设的事实。
