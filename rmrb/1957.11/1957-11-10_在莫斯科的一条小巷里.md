    In a Small Alley in Moscow
    Mi Kun

    In the summer of 1956, one Saturday evening, around eight o'clock, I came out of a cinema near the Moscow River after watching a movie, and started walking home.

    In the Soviet Union, Saturdays were six-hour workdays. After two or four o'clock in the afternoon, people would leave work, except for bookstores, food stores, and entertainment venues. After five or six o'clock, only the main streets, parks, cinemas, and theaters were lively.

    I walked across the Moscow River and turned into a secluded alley, intending to cut through the alley and take a trolleybus on the main street to go home. As soon as I left the cinema, I felt some pain in my abdomen, and by the time I turned into the alley entrance, the pain had become severe. I had to stop and bend over. But the pain only intensified. I had to sit on the sidewalk, almost curled up, with sweat pouring from my head due to the intense pain.

    At this time, there was no one in the alley, and it was silent. Only the glass door and glass windows of a bakery not far away were brightly lit, and occasionally the slight opening and closing sounds of the door and fleeting sparse figures could be heard.

    Curled up, I pressed hard on my abdomen, but the pain continued to intensify. Just when I was helpless, I heard the sound of leather shoes approaching, and it stopped abruptly beside me.

    "What's wrong?" a girl's voice asked.

    I looked up and replied, "I have a stomach ache."

    "Is it very painful?" She leaned down, put her hand on my shoulder, and asked with concern.

    "Yes, very painful. Could you call a taxi for me?"

    "Okay. Right away."

    As soon as she finished speaking, she ran away. I gratefully watched her back, and in the dim light, I saw something fall behind her. But she didn't turn back to pick it up, and instead went straight towards the alley entrance.

    Before long, she ran back, panting, with a worried and uneasy expression.

    "This is terrible! I didn't find an empty taxi on the street, and I'm worried about leaving you here alone. I think you should lie down at my house first, and then I'll call for a taxi."

    Without waiting for my reply, she helped me up, almost supporting me with half of her body, and slowly walked forward. On the way, I realized that she was a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl, and that her name was Natasha, and she had originally gone to the bakery to buy bread to prepare dinner. Then I remembered the thing she had lost.

    "What about your bread?" I asked.

    She didn't answer immediately. After a while, she responded with a smile, "Oops!"

    She supported me, walked out of the alley with difficulty, came to a building, went upstairs, and entered a spacious and comfortable room.

    "This is my home," she said, relieved. Then she helped me lie down on a sofa and put a down pillow behind my back.

    "You must be exhausted?" I looked at her and asked gratefully and apologetically.

    "What's exhausting about this?" She smiled.

    But I noticed her suppressed breathing and saw the faint beads of sweat on her forehead…

    "See how unlucky this is!" she said, deliberately changing the subject. "My mom and dad have gone to the theater. Otherwise, we could have two more helpers." She paused, then continued, "Let me get you something to drink."

    While I was drinking the hot tea with sugar, she stood beside me and watched me. After I finished the tea and rested for a while, she went outside to call for a taxi.

    Soon, she helped me downstairs again and helped me into the car. After giving some instructions to both the driver and me, she waved goodbye with peace of mind.

    That night, I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. The next day at dawn, the doctor performed an appendectomy on me.

    I have been away from Moscow for more than a year. For more than a year, every time I look at and touch the surgical scar still on my abdomen, or when the surgical wound has a faint reaction to a sudden change in the weather, I can't help but think with emotion of Natasha, who was originally a stranger, a fifteen or sixteen-year-old friend of mine…

### 在莫斯科的一条小巷里

    在莫斯科的一条小巷里
    米堃
    1956年夏天，一个星期六的傍晚，大约八点多钟，我从靠近莫斯科河的一家电影院看完电影出来，走回家去。
    在苏联，星期六是六小时工作制。下午两点或四点钟，除去书店、食品店和娱乐场所外，人们都下班了。五、六点钟以后，只有一些主要街道、公园、电影院和戏院的门前，是热闹的。
    我走过莫斯科河，折入一条僻静的小巷，打算穿过小巷，到大街上搭无轨电车回去。刚出电影院时，我就感觉腹部有些疼痛，到转进胡同口，痛得就很厉害了。我不得不站下来，弯着腰。但疼痛反而越来越加剧了。我只得坐到人行道上，几乎是蜷伏着，因为剧烈的疼痛而头上汗水直冒。
    这时胡同内杳无人迹，一片寂静。只有不远的一家面包店的玻璃门和玻璃橱窗是亮堂堂的，偶尔传来门的轻微的开闭声和一闪而过的稀疏的人影。
    我蜷伏着，死劲压着我的腹部，疼痛却不断地加剧着。正在这无可奈何的时候，我听到一阵越来越近的皮鞋的走路声，临到身边，却戛然而止了。
      “您怎么了？”一个女孩子的声音。
    我仰起头看了看，答道：“我肚子痛。”
      “痛得很厉害吗？”她俯下身，用手抚着我的肩，关心地问。
    “厉害。您能给我叫一辆出租汽车来吗？”
    “好的。马上。”
    话刚落音，她就跑着走了。我感激地望着她的背影，隐约的灯光中，我瞧见她身后掉了一件什么东西。但她并不回身拾起，却径直向胡同口奔去了。
    不多久，她气喘呼呼地跑了回来，神情焦灼而不安。
    “真糟糕！街上一辆空车也没遇着，老叫你一个人在这儿待着我又不放心。我看您还是先到我家躺躺，然后我给打电话叫车吧。”
    不等我回答，她就把我搀扶起来，几乎是用半个身子托着我，慢慢地向前走。路上我才看清她是一个十五六岁的女孩子，而且知道她名叫娜达莎，原是去面包店买了面包，回家准备晚餐的。这时我想起她丢失的东西。
    “那您的面包呢？”我问。
    她没有立即回答。停了一会，才笑着应了一声：“嘿！”
    她搀扶着我，艰难地走出了胡同，来到一座楼房，上了楼，走进一个宽敞而舒适的房间。
    “这就是我的家。”她说，松了一口气。然后她把我扶在一张长沙发上躺下，给我背后垫了一个鸭绒枕头。
    “您累坏了吧？”我望着她，感激而又抱歉地问。
    “这累什么？”她笑了笑。
    但我却察觉出了她的压抑的喘息，看见了她额头上的隐约的汗珠……
    “你看真不凑巧！”她有意转换话题说。“我的爸爸和妈妈都看戏去了。要不，我们也可多两个帮手。”她停了停，接着说：“我给您弄点喝的吧。”
    当我喝着带糖的滚热的茶的时候，她一直在旁边站着看着我。等我喝完茶，休息了一会，才到屋外打电话叫车去了。
    不久，她又搀托着我走下楼，扶我上了车。向司机和我都作了一番叮嘱之后，才放心地跟我挥手告别。
    当天夜里，我便坐着急救车进了医院。第二天黎明，医生就给我进行了切除盲肠的手术。
    我离开莫斯科已经一年多了。一年多来，每当我看着和触到我腹部上还留的手术创痕的时候，或是天气骤变刀口有隐隐的反应的时候，我便不无激动地想起了原是陌生的娜达莎，我的一个十五六岁的朋友……
