Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Dispatch. The 120-li long Dongxihu levee project has commenced this month. This levee is one of the main projects of the Dongxihu State Farm, which the people of Wuhan call "Agricultural City," and its commencement signifies that the construction of the Dongxihu Farm has officially begun. Tens of thousands of farmers are concentrating here to build the "Agricultural City."

The Dongxihu State Farm is one of China's agricultural construction projects above the quota limit. It is a modern, large-scale, comprehensive agricultural base serving the city. It has a total of 260,000 mu of land and 140,000 mu of lakes. The farm includes twelve different agricultural enterprises such as vegetables, dairy cows, fish farming, pig farming, and cotton and grain. Once this farm is completed, the two million residents of Wuhan will be able to obtain one jin of milk and one jin of pork per person per month from here. The output of other non-staple foods and industrial raw material crops that will be provided to the city is also enormous.

This large-scale comprehensive farm is expected to be completed by 1962. Among the important projects to be completed before the flood season next year, in addition to the newly started levee project, there are also concrete drainage gate projects, dam projects, and farm area road projects.

    据新华社武汉电　长一百二十里的东西湖围堤工程，已经在本月中旬动工。这道围堤是被武汉市人民称为“农业城”的东西湖国营农场的主要工程之一，它的动工标明东西湖农场的建场工程已经正式开始。数以万计的建设“农业城”的农民，正在向这里集中。
