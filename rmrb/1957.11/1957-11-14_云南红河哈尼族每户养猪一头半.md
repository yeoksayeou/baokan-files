Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 13th November. The Hani people in the Honghe River region of Yunnan Province now raise an average of 1.5 pigs per household, achieving ahead of schedule the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) for 1962. Raising pigs is one of the main sideline production projects for ethnic minorities in the Honghe region. Every year, 50,000 to 60,000 pigs are transported to the interior. In addition, 70,000 to 80,000 jin of pork are supplied to Gejiu City, China's famous tin capital, every year.
