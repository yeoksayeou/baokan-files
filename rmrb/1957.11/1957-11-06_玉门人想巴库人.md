    The Yumen People Think of the Baku People
    Li Ji
    People miss their loved ones more during festivals, the Yumen people think of the Baku people.
    Full of emotion, I can't express it all, a small poem, a piece of heart.
    Flowers bloom in the city of Baku, welcoming Chinese guests.
    The guests live in Yumen City, coming from thousands of miles to learn.
    The smell of Baku oil is fragrant, the smell of Yumen oil fills the hills.
    Baku and Yumen look at each other, the friendship of oil workers is deep and long.
    Baku's sons come to Yumen, bringing a sincere heart.
    Regardless of the ice, snow, and strong winds, before the "Christmas tree" [note] at dusk.
    In the tent on the Gobi Desert, two brothers are talking.
    The stars in the sky can testify, the Black Sea does not have this deep friendship!
    "Leaving Baku and parting with loved ones, coming to Yumen from thousands of miles away.
    Not afraid of wind, frost, rain, or dew, only wishing to teach the technology to Chinese brothers early.
    "Only wishing to turn Yumen into Baku, crossing mountains and rivers to find oil.
    With oil, the Chinese people will have happiness, may your oil seas flow like the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers!"
    People miss their loved ones more during festivals, the Yumen people congratulate the Baku people.
    Thank you for the brotherly affection as heavy as a mountain, may Baku always be the treasure bowl of the Soviet people.
    [Note] Refers to the oil extraction device on an oil well.
              October 1957, Xiyuan.

    玉门人想巴库人
    李季人逢佳节倍思亲，玉门人想巴库人。满怀激情诉不尽，一首小诗一片心。巴库城里鲜花开，迎接中国客人来。客人家住玉门市，千山万水拜师来。巴库石油扑鼻香，玉门油香漫山岗。巴库玉门两相望，石油工人的友谊深又长。巴库的儿子来玉门，带来一颗诚挚的心。不顾冰雪狂风紧，圣诞树〔注〕前度黄昏。戈壁滩上帐篷里，一对兄弟在谈心。天上的星星可作证，黑海水也没有这友情深！“远离巴库别亲人，千里迢迢来玉门。风霜雨露全不怕，只愿把技术早早教给中国的兄弟们。“只愿把玉门变巴库，翻山涉水找石油。有了石油中国人民就有幸福，愿你们的油海像长江、黄河一样流！”人逢佳节倍思亲，玉门人祝贺巴库人。感谢兄弟情义重如山，祝巴库永远是苏联人民的聚宝盆。
    〔注〕石油井上的采油装置。
