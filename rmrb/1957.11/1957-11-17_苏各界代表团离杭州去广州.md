    苏各界代表团离杭州去广州
    新华社杭州16日电  以苏中友好协会主席安德烈耶夫为首的苏联各界参加中国人民庆祝十月革命四十周年纪念代表团，在中苏友好协会总会副会长廖承志和理事曹孟君陪同下，今天下午六时多乘火车离杭州去广州。到车站送行的有中共浙江省委书记处书记、浙江省副省长、浙江省中苏友好协会会长霍士廉，中共杭州市委第一书记、杭州市市长、杭州市中苏友好协会会长吴宪等人。
    客人们今天在杭州参观了都锦生丝织厂。安德烈耶夫团长在参观时详尽地询问了丝织风景的生产过程。苏联著名的纺织女工沃尔科娃和曾经在1925到1927年支援过我国大革命并参加过我国第一次国内革命战争的老布尔什维克基斯连柯，还向三百多个工人讲了话。他们的讲话一再被工人们热烈的掌声打断。客人们今天还游览了西湖、三潭印月、玉泉和灵隐寺。
