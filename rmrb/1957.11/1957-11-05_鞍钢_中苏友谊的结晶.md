Anshan Iron and Steel – Crystallization of Sino-Soviet Friendship
Anshan Iron and Steel Company General Manager Yuan Zhen

Anshan Iron and Steel (Angang) is an important project among the 156 projects aided by the Soviet Union in our country's construction. Angang can truly be called the crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship.

Over the past few years, the Soviet Union has provided comprehensive, enormous, and meticulous assistance to Angang's production and construction. Of the 37 major projects determined by the state for construction in Angang during the First Five-Year Plan, 34 have already been put into production. These projects have all been successfully constructed with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. For example, our mining plants, sintering plants, coking plants, iron smelting plants, steelmaking plants, and rolling mills, from design to equipment, are mostly supplied by the Soviet Union, and are all state-of-the-art. In terms of construction, these extremely complex projects, which Chinese workers and Chinese technicians had never undertaken before, were also built with the enthusiastic assistance of experienced Soviet experts, who can be said to have taught us hand-in-hand, like a teacher teaching a primary school student to write. Angang's production level in a short period of eight years has increased more than three times compared to the highest level during the Japanese imperialist occupation period, which is inseparable from this Soviet internationalist assistance.

At the invitation of the Chinese government, the Soviet government has successively dispatched more than 100 experts to Angang to assist in the work. The Soviet experts have provided so much assistance to Angang in terms of technology and management over the past few years that it is difficult to summarize in a few words. According to incomplete statistics, important suggestions alone have reached more than 5,000. Because we have implemented these suggestions, we have initially learned many advanced Soviet experiences in iron smelting, steelmaking, rolling, and other aspects. These suggestions have helped us solve many major and critical problems in production. It is precisely because of these suggestions that our production has been able to develop rapidly in a very short period of time. For example, during the Japanese occupation period, Angang's molten iron could not directly enter the open-hearth furnace for steelmaking because of its high silicon content and had to undergo desiliconization in a pre-refining furnace. This backward production method seriously affected the capacity of the steelmaking plant. When the Japanese ruled Angang, they painstakingly conducted countless smelting experiments of low-silicon iron, but all failed. However, with the help of Soviet experts, we quickly and successfully realized the smelting of low-silicon pig iron, eliminated the operating procedures of the pre-refining furnace, and converted the pre-refining furnace into an open-hearth furnace. This one suggestion alone increased the production capacity of the steelmaking plant by more than 30%.

For the production and construction of Angang, the Soviet government, at the request of the Chinese government, accepted thousands of Angang cadres and workers to study in the Soviet Union. During their study in the Soviet Union, our comrades received meticulous care from the Soviet Union and also learned a lot of valuable knowledge. Many comrades have changed from laymen to experts. The Soviet experts working in Angang have also made great achievements in training Chinese experts. For example, pass design is regarded as extremely confidential technology in capitalist countries, and it was difficult for Chinese people to learn it in the past. With the spirit of internationalism, Soviet experts taught their extremely rich knowledge and experience to Chinese technicians without reservation, and cultivated more than 60 Chinese pass design personnel. Now these people can independently carry out pass design for new varieties of steel.

Soviet experts attach great importance to building the country through diligence and thrift and practicing strict economy, and pay great attention to saving and utilizing every bit of wealth of China. They constantly put forward suggestions for overcoming the phenomenon of waste in Angang, simply every moment, everywhere, and in every detail, to ensure the realization of the spirit of our Party Central Committee's instructions of "spending less money to do more things," "building the country through diligence and thrift," and "running enterprises through diligence and thrift." For example, after the production capacity of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant increased, the capacity of the No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill was insufficient. At this time, to increase production, there were only two ways: to add new equipment and to tap the existing potential. The former required a lot of investment and took a long time, but Soviet experts tried every means to analyze and study the equipment of the primary rolling mill many times, and finally decided to take the latter path, that is, to put forward a plan to tap the potential of the twenty-four continuous rolling mill and assist in its implementation. As a result, very little money was spent, and the capacity of the primary rolling mill was increased by more than 15%. In addition, experts constantly suggested that we should attach importance to the utilization of cheap raw materials, waste materials, and substitutes, such as suggesting the use of coke powder instead of anthracite coal and the use of sulfuric acid slag instead of rich ore powder for sintered ore. These valuable suggestions have saved a lot of state funds and created wealth for us.

In the production of Angang, some problems that we had never seen before and could not deal with often appeared. However, thanks to the help of Soviet experts, we not only learned to solve these problems smoothly, but also found ways to avoid these problems from happening again. For example, the water quality deterioration accident in 1956 burned out a large number of cooling equipment and seriously threatened the production of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. If it could not be dealt with in time, it would inevitably cause great losses. However, with the help of experienced Soviet experts, we dealt with this problem in time, and our production situation quickly turned from danger to safety.

What also deeply moves us is the noble character of Soviet experts. That kind of humble and practical, hard-working and simple style, that kind of high working enthusiasm, working initiative, and high degree of internationalism are all difficult to express in words. Many experts forgot to eat, forgot to rest, and forgot to sleep when they were busy at work, working day and night. For example, when problems occurred in iron smelting production, they did not leave the equipment day and night; when the steelmaking production could not complete the task, the experts were on duty day and night, and never left the open-hearth furnace for a moment; when repairing the large motor of the primary rolling mill, in the high-temperature workshop, two experts worked continuously for a week, sleeping only three to five hours a day, until the large motor was repaired. For example, in order to ensure safe transportation, transportation experts even worked shifts with Chinese comrades on the spot during the New Year's holiday. When people in our country were celebrating the New Year, this respectable white-haired international friend was working bravely with Chinese employees on the busy railway line of Angang in the weather of more than 20 degrees below zero. This friendship, this spirit of internationalism, deeply moved us.

Writing here, we can't help but think of the contempt and ridicule that Japanese imperialists issued to us when Angang began to recover. They said: "You will not be able to smelt steel on this land of Angang, you can only grow sorghum." "It will take you at least twenty years to restore Angang." But today, it is they themselves who are ruthlessly ridiculed by the facts, not us. Let us look at the following figures. Compared with the highest annual output during the Japanese occupation period (1943), Angang's planned output in 1957 increased: steel increased to 3.3 times; iron increased to 2.5 times; steel materials increased to 5.1 times. We are confident that we can complete the plan for 1957 ahead of schedule. Here, we can't help but deeply feel the importance of the internationalist unity between China and the Soviet Union, and we also deeply realize the greatness of the meaning of the October Revolution. After the Soviet Red Army eliminated the Japanese invaders and the Chinese People's Liberation Army eliminated the Kuomintang reactionaries, our Angang employees enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and actively participated in the struggle to restore production. At that time, Angang was in ruins and desolate. We used our own hands to remove the weeds that were as deep as a person under the blast furnace, leveled the uneven roads, and repaired some of the remaining dilapidated machines. When we were in great difficulty, the Party and government of the Soviet Union extended a great internationalist hand of friendship to us and have given us comprehensive and selfless assistance for eight years. When we think of this, the gratitude from the bottom of our hearts to the Soviet Union from all our employees is difficult to express in words.

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the great October Revolution, all the employees of Angang express our warm congratulations and high respect to the Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet experts with infinite gratitude. We will continue to unremittingly learn from the advanced experience of Soviet production and construction, conscientiously implement the experts' suggestions, and produce more and better steel for the motherland. We wish the Soviet people greater and more brilliant achievements in building communism.

    鞍钢——中苏友谊的结晶
    鞍山钢铁公司总经理　袁振
    鞍钢是苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六项工程中重要项目之一。鞍钢真可以说是中苏友谊的结晶。
    苏联几年来对鞍钢的生产建设给了全面的巨大的无微不至的援助。国家确定在第一个五年计划内建设鞍钢三十七项主要工程中，目前已有三十四项投入生产。这些项目都是在苏联无私的援助下建设成功的。如我们的采矿厂、烧结厂、焦化厂、炼铁厂、炼钢厂、轧钢厂等，从设计到设备绝大部分都是苏联供应的，而且都是最先进的。在施工方面这些技术极为复杂而且中国工人、中国技术人员从来没有干过的工程，也都是在热情的经验丰富的苏联专家的帮助下，可以说是像老师教小学生写字一样手把手的教导下建成的。鞍钢的生产水平在短短的八年期间，能比日本帝国主义占领时期最高水平增长了三倍以上，和苏联这种国际主义援助是不可分的。
    根据中国政府的邀请苏联政府先后已派遣了一百多名专家来鞍钢帮助工作。苏联专家对鞍钢在技术方面、管理方面几年来所给予的大量帮助太多了，那是很难用几句话说完的。据不完全的统计，仅重要的建议先后即达五千多件。由于我们贯彻了这些建议，使我们初步学会了苏联炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等各方面的许多先进的经验，这些建议帮助我们解决了许多生产上的重大关键问题。正是因为有这些建议才使我们的生产能够在很短的时间内有了突飞猛进的发展。如在日本占领时期鞍钢的铁水因为含硅过高不能直接进入平炉炼钢，必须经过预炼炉脱硅。这种落后的生产方法严重的影响了炼钢厂能力的发挥，日本统治鞍钢时曾为此煞费苦心，进行过无数次低硅铁的冶炼试验，结果均告失败；但在苏联专家的帮助下我们很快的胜利地实现了低硅生铁的冶炼，取消了预炼炉的操作程序，即将预炼炉改成了平炉，仅此一项建议即使炼钢厂的生产能力提高了30％以上。
    为了鞍钢的生产建设，苏联政府根据中国政府的要求曾接受上千名鞍钢的干部和工人去苏联学习，我们这些同志在苏联学习期间都受到了苏联无微不至的关怀，同时也学到了许多宝贵的知识。已有许多同志由外行变为内行。在鞍钢工作的苏联专家同志，他们对培养中国专家也做出了很大的成绩。如孔型设计在资本主义国家被视为极为保密的技术，中国人过去是难于学到的，苏联专家以国际主义的精神将其极为丰富的知识和经验毫无保留地教给了中国的技术人员，培养出了六十余名中国孔型设计人员。现在这些人都已能独立进行新品种钢材的孔型设计。
    苏联专家对勤俭建国厉行节约是十分重视的，对中国一点一滴的财富都十分注意节约利用。对于克服鞍钢的浪费现象简直是时时刻刻、处处入微的经常提出建议来保证实现我们党中央指示“少花钱多办事”“勤俭建国”“勤俭办企业”的精神。如一炼钢厂的生产能力提高后，第一初轧厂的能力便不敷要
  求。这时要增产只有增加新设备和挖掘现有的潜力两条道路可走。而前者既要
  很多投资又在时间上拖得很久，但苏联专家想尽办法，对初轧厂设备进行多次分析和研究，最后终于确定走后一个道路，即提出挖掘二十四连轧机潜力的方案并协助实现。结果花钱极少，初轧厂的能力即提高了15％以上。此外专家也不断的建议我们要重视利用廉价原料、废料和代用品，如对烧结矿提出利用焦粉代替无烟煤，使用硫酸渣代替富矿粉等，这些宝贵的建议都大量的为我们节约了国家的资金并创造了财富。
    在鞍钢的生产中，时常出现一些我们从未见过也无法对付的一些问题。可是由于有苏联专家的帮助，我们不但学会了顺利解决这些问题，而且能设法避免这些问题的再次发生。如1956年发生的水质恶化事故，曾大量的烧坏冷却设备，严重的威胁高炉和平炉的生产，如不能及时处理，势必造成极大的损失。但在经验丰富的苏联专家帮助下，我们及时处理了这个问题，使我们的生产情况迅速的转危为安。
    还使我们深深感动的是苏联专家的高尚品质。那种谦虚实际、艰苦朴素的作风，那种高度的工作热情、工作积极性和高度的国际主义精神均一言难尽。许多专家在工作紧张的时候忘记了吃饭，忘记了休息，忘记了睡眠，夜以继
  日的不停的工作着。如炼铁生产发生问题时，日夜不离开设备；炼钢生产完不成任务，专家们日夜值班，片刻不离平炉；修理初轧机大马达的时候，在高温车间，炎热的夏天有两位专家竟一星期来每天只睡三五个小时的觉，一直坚持不停的劳动，直到把大马达修好为止。又如运输专家为了保证安全运输甚至在新年节日里也和中国同志一起到现场分工值班。在我国人民家家户户欢庆新年的时候，我们这位可敬的白发苍苍的国际友人在零下二十多度的天气里，却正在鞍钢繁忙的铁道线上和中国职工同志一齐英勇的劳动着。这种友谊，这种国际主义精神，使我们深深感动。
    写到这里，我们不禁想起日本帝国主义者在鞍山开始恢复的时候对我们所发出的轻视和嘲笑，他们说：“你们在鞍钢这块土地上不会炼出钢铁的，只能种高粱啦”“你们恢复鞍钢起码要二十年”。但是今天被事实所无情嘲笑的恰恰是他们自己而不是我们。让我们看看以下这些数字吧。1957年鞍钢的计划产量与日本占领时期最高年产量（1943年）相比：钢增加到三点三倍；铁增加到二点五倍；钢材增加到五点一倍，1957年的计划，我们是有把握提前完成的。在这里不禁使我们深深感到中苏两国国际主义团结之重要，又使我们深深的体会到十月革命意义之伟大。当苏联红军消灭了日寇，中国人民解放军消灭了国民党反动派后，我们鞍钢的职工热烈的响应党的号召，积极的投入恢复生产的斗争。当时鞍钢一片废墟满目荒凉，我们用自己的双手铲除了高炉底下人深的野草，铲平了高低不平的道路，修复了仅存的一些残破的机器。正在我们万分困难的时候，苏联的党和政府向我们伸出了伟大的国际主义的友谊之手，八年来一直的给了我们全面无私的援助，当我们想到这一点的时候，我们全体职工，每个人从内心里对苏联发出来的感谢，是难以用语言来表达的。
    值此伟大的十月革命四十周年之际，我们鞍钢全体职工怀着无限感激的心情，谨向苏联人民，苏联共产党，苏联政府和苏联专家表示热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。我们将继续不懈的学习苏联生产建设的先进经验，认真的贯彻专家建议，为祖国生产更多更好的钢铁，愿苏联人民在建设共产主义事业中取得更巨大更辉煌的成就。
