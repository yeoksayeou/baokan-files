Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 26th (TASS): A reception was held on the evening of November 25th in the Grand Kremlin Palace by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union to receive the graduates of Moscow's military academies.

The Soviet party and government leaders Bulganin, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Suslov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, Shvernik, Pospelov, Kosygin, Pervukhin, as well as marshals, generals, admirals, and other officers of the Soviet armed forces attended the reception.

Khrushchev spoke at the reception.

Khrushchev said:

Dear Comrades!

On behalf of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government, I extend warm greetings and congratulations to you on your successful graduation from military academies and your appointment as officers in our armed forces.

I am pleased to point out that among those graduating with you are a number of our friends, officers from the people's democratic countries. Allow me to extend my heartfelt greetings to these comrades and wish them success in their future work, so that the armies of the socialist countries—armies that maintain combat cooperation with the Soviet army and jointly defend the peaceful labor of the people of all countries—will continue to be strengthened.

The professors and instructors, commanders and political workers of the various military academies have made great contributions to the training of outstanding military cadres. Allow me to pay tribute to them, thank them for their noble labor, and thank them for the excellent education and training of officers.

Comrades!

Not long ago, the Soviet people and all progressive humanity celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution with pride and joy. Our country greeted this great holiday with tremendous achievements in the development of industry, agriculture, science, technology, and culture.

The Soviet Union has shown the world the historically significant victory of socialism. Our motherland has made great strides in the development of industry and of the entire socialist economy, and in the development of science and technology. The successful creation of intercontinental ballistic missiles and the launching of artificial earth satellites convincingly demonstrate the level of development our country's science and technology has reached. Artificial earth satellites are still orbiting the earth, letting people all over the world know the great achievements of the Soviet people and the socialist countries.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has always been unswervingly concerned with enhancing national defense and strengthening the armed forces that gloriously defend the victorious achievements of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The Soviet state supplies its army and navy with all kinds of modern combat technology and weapons, including atomic weapons and rocket technology.

However, the most important thing in our armed forces is people. Without people and their skills, any technology will become dead. You have mastered many kinds of military technology. After graduating from military academies, you should continue to study military affairs in your practical work in the army and master the ever-changing knowledge of various military technologies. But your task is not only to enrich your knowledge, but also to pass on this knowledge to our excellent Soviet soldiers who come from factories, collective farms, and state-owned farms.

The great Lenin taught that the soaring will of the people and the army is of decisive significance in the cause of defending the socialist motherland from enemy invasion. The Communist Party constantly educates Soviet soldiers in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, loyalty to the Soviet people, and devotion to the cause of communism, and cultivates high moral, political, and combat qualities in the entire army. These excellent qualities of the Soviet people were prominently manifested in the collective heroism, perseverance, and bravery of the front-line soldiers and the people in the rear during the Great Patriotic War.

Our party has always attached special importance to the education and training of officers of the army and navy, because they are a valuable asset of our armed forces. After the war, the Soviet armed forces, under the leadership of the Communist Party, became even stronger and embarked on a new stage of development.

Comrades!

The main source of the strength and power of our armed forces is that the Communist Party is its organizer, leader, and educator. Our party has always been unswervingly concerned about the Soviet army and navy and about the political education of Soviet soldiers. As you know, at the end of October this year, the CPSU Central Committee held a plenary session to discuss the "issue of improving party and political work in the Soviet army and navy."

The reason this issue was brought up for discussion at the plenary session was that the Central Committee recently discovered that the former Minister of Defense, Zhukov, violated the Leninist principles of leading the armed forces, carried out the dangerous line of diminishing the work of party organizations, political work organs, and military committees, and separating the army from the party. These practices were very harmful to our motherland's national defense and to socialist and communist construction.

The resolution of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee is to further enhance the role of the party in leading the armed forces. This document sets out a complete plan, based on the resolutions of the 20th National Congress of the CPSU, to fundamentally improve party and political work in the army and navy. The resolution of the October plenary session of the Central Committee has been supported and endorsed by the entire party and the people of the whole country. This resolution has been unanimously supported by the entire personnel of the army and navy, which clearly proves that the Central Committee's measures to correct the erroneous line of the former Minister of Defense are correct and timely.

Further improving the combat effectiveness of the army and navy is the common task of all Communist Party members, commanders, and political workers. Only by close cooperation between commanders and political workers to improve the cultivation and education of officers and soldiers, to improve the combat readiness of the army, and only by strengthening the system of one-man leadership and improving party and political work in the army and navy, can this huge national task be accomplished.

At present, the most important task in the world is to fight for the defense of peace. The declaration issued by the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries held in Moscow not long ago emphasized that "the fundamental issue of world politics has become war or peaceful coexistence. The people of all countries must maintain the greatest vigilance against the danger of war created by imperialism."

In sharp contrast to the consistent peaceful policy of the socialist camp countries, the US aggressive bloc is pursuing a policy of undermining peace and creating the danger of new wars. It must be remembered that as long as imperialism exists, the breeding ground for aggressive war will also exist.

The complex international situation requires us to continue to maintain national defense at the level of modern military technology and military science to ensure the security of our socialist country.

Under these conditions, we have no right to forget that with the development of science and technology, military science is also undergoing major changes, new types of combat equipment and weapons are constantly emerging, and the methods of using them in combat are also changing.

Precisely because of this, the party requires military cadres not to be satisfied with the achievements they have already made, but to strive to advance military science, constantly increase their military knowledge, tenaciously master new combat technologies, and improve the vigilance and combat readiness of the army.

Dear Comrades!

The meeting between the leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government and the graduates of higher military schools began long ago, and the great Lenin personally participated in it. This is a good tradition. Our higher military schools send to the army commanders, military engineers, political workers, and other military experts who are highly educated and proficient in their profession. From you, we see an excellent contingent that is loyal to the Communist Party and the Soviet people, full of youthful energy and creativity. We believe that you will inherit and develop the glorious traditions of Soviet officers.

The strength of our army lies in the fact that officers and soldiers are all loyal sons of the Soviet people. Their goals are the same, and their tasks are the same. You, officer comrades, should always show fatherly care to your subordinates, maintain close ties with them, respect their personality, be good at listening to their opinions, understand their needs and emotions, and provide them with the necessary help in a timely manner.

Party and political work and the entire educational work should be done to the extent that soldiers fulfill their mission not out of fear, but out of self-consciousness. The Soviet army is strong precisely because its soldiers and commanders have a high degree of ideological principle and self-awareness.

Dear Comrades, allow me to once again extend my heartfelt congratulations to you, and wish you health and victory in your work to consolidate the defense capabilities of the socialist country.

Long live our heroic armed forces and its officer cadres!

Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the organizer and leader of the Soviet armed forces!

    苏军首要职责在于保卫和平
    赫鲁晓夫勖勉莫斯科军事学院毕业生
    新华社26日讯　塔斯社莫斯科25日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议25日晚在大克里姆林宫举行招待会，招待莫斯科各军事学院的毕业生。
    苏联党政领导人布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、米高扬、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克、波斯伯洛夫、柯西金、别尔乌辛以及苏联武装部队的元帅、将军、海军上将和其他军官都出席了招待会。
    赫鲁晓夫在招待会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫说：
    亲爱的同志们！
    我受苏共中央和苏联政府的委托，向你们热烈致意和祝贺你们顺利地从军事学院毕业和被任命为我国武装部队的军官。
    我高兴地指出，同你们一道毕业的还有一批我们的朋友，人民民主国家的军官。请允许我向这些同志衷心致意，并祝他们今后在工作中取得成绩，使社会主义国家的军队——同苏联军队保持战斗合作、一起捍卫各国人民和平劳动的军队——不断获得加强。
    各军事学院的教授和教员、指挥员和政治工作人员在培养优秀军事干部的工作中有着很大的功绩。请允许我向他们致敬，感谢他们崇高的劳动，感谢他们对军官的良好教育和培养。
    同志们！
    不久前，苏联人民和全体进步人类怀着自豪和愉快的心情庆祝了伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。我国以发展工业、农业、科学、技术和文化方面的巨大成就迎接了这个伟大的节日。
    苏联向全世界显示了社会主义的具有历史意义的胜利。我们的祖国在发展工业和整个社会主义经济方面，在发展科学和技术方面大大地前进了。洲际弹道火箭的制成和人造地球卫星的发射成功令人信服地说明了我国的科学和技术的发展已经达到何等高度的水平。人造地球卫星现在还在环绕地球运行，让全世界人们晓得苏联人民和社会主义国家的丰功伟绩。
    苏联共产党始终不渝地关心提高国防力量和加强光荣地捍卫着伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利果实的武装力量。苏维埃国家用各种现代化的战斗技术和武器其中包括原子武器和火箭技术，供给自己的陆军和海军。
    但是，我国武装力量中最重要的是人。没有人，没有他们的技能，任何技术都将成为死的。你们掌握了很多种类的军事技术。你们在军事学院毕业以后，到军队里做实际工作时还应该继续学习军事，掌握日新月异的各种军事技术知识。但是你们的任务不仅仅是自己充实知识，而且要把知识传授给我们那些来自工厂、集体农庄和国营农场的优秀的苏维埃军人。
    伟大的列宁教导说，人民和军队的昂扬意志在保卫社会主义祖国免遭敌人侵犯的事业中具有决定意义。共产党经常以马克思列宁主义思想、忠于苏联人民、矢忠于共产主义事业的精神教育苏维埃战士，在全军中培养高度的道德、政治和战斗品质。苏维埃人这些优秀的品质，在伟大卫国战争年代突出地表现为前方战士和后方人民的集体英雄主义、坚毅和勇敢。
    我们党一向特别重视教育和培养陆海军的军官干部，因为他们是我国武装部队的宝贵财产。战后，苏联武装部队在共产党的领导下更加强大了，并且走上了发展的新阶段。
    同志们！
    我国武装部队的力量和威力的主要源泉在于共产党是它的组织者、领导者和教育者。我们党始终不渝地关怀苏联陆海军，关怀苏维埃战士的政治教育。你们知道，在今年10月底举行了苏共中央全会，这次会议讨论了“关于改善苏联陆海军中党和政治工作”问题。
    把这个问题提到全体会议上来讨论是因为中央委员会最近发现，前国防部长朱可夫破坏了领导武装部队的列宁主义原则，执行了缩小党组织、政治工作机关和军事委员会的工作以及使军队脱离党的危险路线。这些作法对于我们祖国的国防以及社会主义和共产主义建设非常有害。
    苏共中央全体会议的决议是要进一步提高党领导武装部队的作用。在这个文件中，制定了以苏共第二十次代表大会的决议为基础的根本改善陆军和海军中党和政治工作的完备的计划。中央委员会十月全会的决议受到了全党和全国人民的支持和拥护。这个决议受到陆军和海军全体人员的一致拥护，这明显地证明了，中央委员会纠正前国防部长的错误路线的措施是正确的和适时的。
    进一步提高陆军和海军的战斗力是一切共产党员、指挥员和政治工作人员的共同任务。只有指挥员和政治工作人员密切合作来改善对官兵的培养和教育、提高军队的战斗准备，只有加强一长制和改善陆军和海军中的党和政治工作，才能完成这项巨大的国家任务。
    目前世界上最重大的任务就是为保卫和平而斗争。不久之前在莫斯科举行的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议发表的宣言强调指出，“是战争还是和平共处，已经成为世界政治的根本问题。世界各国人民对于帝国主义所造成的战争危险必须保持最大的警惕。”
    和社会主义阵营国家的一贯的和平政策恰恰相反，美国侵略集团执行破坏和平的政策，制造新战争的危险。必须记住：帝国主义存在一天，侵略战争的温床也就存在一天。
    复杂的国际局势要求我们今后仍然要把国防保持在现代军事技术和军事科学的水平上，保证我们社会主义国家的安全。
    在这种条件下我们没有权利忘记：随着科学技术的发展，军事学也在发生重大的变化，新型的战斗装备和武器不断出现，在战斗中使用它们的方法也在改变。
    正因为这样，党才要求军事干部不要满足于已经取得的成就，而要竭力把军事科学向前推进，不断地增进自己的军事知识，顽强地掌握新的战斗技术，提高军队的警惕性和战斗准备。
    亲爱的同志们！
    共产党和苏联政府的领导人同高等军事学校的毕业生的会见早就开始了，当时伟大的列宁就曾经亲自参加过，这是个好传统。我们的高等军事学校向军队输送受过高等教育、精通业务的指挥员、军事工程师、政治工作人员和其他军事专家。从你们身上，我们看到了一支忠实于共产党和苏联人民，充满着青年的精力和创造力的卓越的队伍。我们相信，你们将会继承和发挥苏联军官的光荣传统。
    我国军队的力量在于，军官和士兵都是苏联人民忠实的儿子。他们的目的一致，任务一致。你们，军官同志们，应当永远对下级表示父亲般的关怀，密切联系他们，尊重他们的人格，善于倾听他们的意见，了解他们的需要和情绪，及时地给予他们必要的帮助。
    党和政治工作以及整个教育工作应当作到这一步：使军人不是出于畏惧、而是出于自觉去完成自己的使命。苏联军队之所以强有力，首先是由于自己的战士和指挥员有高度的思想原则性和自觉性。
    亲爱的同志们，请允许我再一次衷心地祝贺你们，并祝你们健康和在巩固社会主义国家防御力量的工作中取得胜利。
    我们英勇的武装部队和它的军官干部万岁！
    苏联武装部队的组织者和领导者苏联共产党万岁！
