Refuting Leftist Lao Yin
—A Sketch of a Rural Debate
By Our Correspondent Jin Feng
	(1) "Those who say one jin is enough, stand over there; those who say it's not enough, stand over here!"
	As soon as the wealthy middle peasant, Lao Yin, opened his mouth, he immediately attracted the attention of the entire audience. He said with a beaming face and a lively expression to production team leader Zhang Fude, "You say unified purchase and sale is good, and I also say it's good, but it just doesn't fill people's stomachs. When you go to the fields with a hoe, people will surely say, 'Aren't you still asleep?' Not to mention doing work. Therefore, if less grain is harvested, society will progress slower!"
	"Let me talk about my stomach and my conscience," said the new middle peasant Zhao Xiangzao. "To be honest, my stomach is not full. But speaking from the conscience, we suffered from disasters for three years, and people transported grain over mountains and seas to help us. This year we have a good harvest, and if we want to eat more but don't supply the disaster areas, that's called being ungrateful! But what about our stomachs? We can find some vegetable paste to mix with it and get by."
	Zhao Xiangzao's talk about his stomach and conscience made everyone laugh. The atmosphere of the meeting was very lively, and more and more people said they didn't have enough to eat. The wealthy middle peasant Jin Guizhen was particularly vocal. He said that he had lost sixteen jin in weight this year alone, and if this continued for another two years, he would be finished.
	Jin Shouhai and Zhang Fude, who were in charge of the meeting, were at a loss. Jin Shouhai tried to change the subject, saying, "Let's calculate how much we ate before and how much we eat with unified purchase and sale."
	"Less, of course," Lao Yin replied. "I'm so hungry that I'm seeing stars. Everything else is fine, but this one jin is unbearable." Seeing that most people in the audience were echoing his complaint about not having enough to eat, he was very happy and couldn't help but pour out all the words he had been holding back for years: "In the old days when things were more casual, there were also famines. During the great drought of the ninth year of the Republic of China, big merchants and traders knew that you were short of grain, and they transported grain from afar to Wangdu, stockpiling it in large quantities. I found an acquaintance and asked him to say a word, hitched up a cart, got a guarantor, and pulled back a few bags without paying. Those who couldn't afford it could take on long-term work! If that didn't work, they could flee the famine!" At this time, the audience began to stir. Some people said in low voices, "Isn't that trafficking in grain?" Others said, "Fleeing the famine, taking on long-term work, that's a dead end for the poor!" But Lao Yin didn't hear these comments and became more and more excited: "In those years, there were plenty of people fleeing the famine, families upon families coming to our place, three or five people standing at your door. This society has changed, and everyone is given the same amount, one jin. If you beg from me, I won't even have anything. I bet if you try going out now, you'll starve to death in five days!"
	Communist Youth League member Li Jincui couldn't bear it any longer and said, "Anyway, I have enough to eat. I haven't gone hungry at all these past few years of disaster!"
	"If everyone feels it's enough," Lao Yin spat contemptuously, "then how about reducing it a little more, to twelve ounces?" Seeing that everyone was silent, he added, "Now that our stomachs are being frugal, the land is also being frugal, so less grain is being harvested! Who says one jin is enough, stand over there; those who say it's not enough, stand over here!" He shouted at the top of his voice.
	"Good, good, stand up, stand up," the wealthy middle peasants Hu Xianggui and Jin Guizhen stood up and echoed, and the meeting hall became a noisy mess. Jin Shouhai had to quickly announce the adjournment of the meeting.

	(2) Who Controls the Fate of Grain?
	"We all say we don't have enough to eat, but how much do we actually need to be satisfied?" The meeting was presided over by Deputy Director Jin Junjie, who had a clear idea in his mind and asked very calmly.
	"If you want everyone to carry big flags, beat peace drums, and sing peace songs to go to the fields for production, then each person needs at least two jin!" Lao Yin said very smoothly, as if representing public opinion.
	Lao Qinghe suddenly stood up and said loudly, "If one person eats two jin, where does that two jin come from? We have to calculate how much grain our village can produce. We can't just make demands!"
	"That's right, calculate the accounts," everyone agreed. So, the abacus was found, and the cooperative's accounts were brought out. The abacus clicked and clacked, and people were calculating in their minds. The whole village had two thousand people, and at two jin per person per day, they would eat 1.44 million jin a year. The village produced 1.01 million jin of grain. Subtracting the public grain and seeds, there were 820,000 jin left. The difference between that and 1.44 million jin was 620,000 jin.
	"So, at two jin per person per day, the state would have to send our village 620,000 jin! This year is still a bumper year, so where does this money come from?" Lao Qinghe asked Lao Yin calmly.
	Lao Yin couldn't answer, and Deputy Director Jin Junjie followed up by saying, "We all clamor that we don't have enough to eat, but there are many who are selling dried yams. If we don't have enough to eat, why are we selling dried yams? Some are selling several hundred jin." (At this time, there was some commotion in the meeting hall, and the wealthy middle peasant Jin Guizhen, who had claimed to have lost sixteen jin, was quietly slipping to the corner of the wall, looking like he was afraid of being named, because he was the one who had sold several hundred jin of dried yams last spring.) "Some are carrying corn to the market to sell. If we really don't have enough to eat, why are we selling dried yams? Are we eating according to one jin? No one is eating according to one jin!"
	Then he calculated the grain distribution accounts of Lao Yin and several other wealthy middle peasants. Lao Yin received 4,590 jin of grain last year. Subtracting 120 jin for feed, there were still 4,470 jin. For a family of nine (including five children), the average per person per year was more than 496 jin, which was more than 41 jin per month. There was also Jin Kai, who was complaining about not having enough to eat, but his family received more than 1,300 jin per person. And the Jin Fuhe family received more than 1,400 jin per person...
	As the accounts were calculated one by one, Director Jin Junfeng said in a deep voice, "We all ate grain against our conscience last year. We ate so much, and we still say we don't have enough to eat. How much do we have to eat to be satisfied?"
	The atmosphere in the meeting hall was a bit tense. Jin Junjie then said, "At the last meeting, Lao Yin proposed several ways to survive disasters: trafficking in grain, begging, and taking on long-term work are all better than what we're eating now. Let's discuss this."
	"Begging is difficult," said Song Laohe, who had taken on long-term work and begged for food. "If you don't go out for a meal, you'll go hungry. If you go out, you're not guaranteed to get anything. People are happy to give you some cold tea and cold rice, but if they're not happy, they'll give you a few cold words. It's rare to be full. Begging is the hardest thing in the world. If you had even half a jin of grain at home, you wouldn't go out to beg!"
	"Is taking on long-term work good?" Old poor peasant Li Laoxi's voice trembled slightly when he said this. "I took on long-term work for forty years, and I can't even mention the suffering I endured. You have to go out even if it's cold, hot, windy, snowy, or raining knives! As the saying goes: the red-eyed grind the blind, and those who take on long-term work become beggars. If it weren't for the Communist Party, I would have become a beggar."
	"Didn't Song Laohe and your father become beggars?" Old peasant Wang Laoguo pointed at Song Laohe. "And Wang Laolian's grandfather took on long-term work his whole life and went blind. If it weren't for this society, he wouldn't even be able to find the door to beg for food. He would have starved to death!"
	"The fields are bare, the clothes are torn, and those who take on long-term work cry to the landlord!" Li Laoxi said, his voice choking. The atmosphere in the hall was very heavy.
	At this time, Lao Yin was like a beast caged in a cage, pacing back and forth on the ground.
	Zhao Xiangzao, who had talked about his stomach and conscience at the previous meeting, also came out to speak: "When I was little, I also begged for food, and my brother went with me. But now he's in middle school and has gone to work. You say one jin isn't much, but if someone had given me four ounces back then, I wouldn't have begged for food!"
	"I'm not saying that begging and fleeing the famine are good," Lao Yin defended in a low voice. "I'm saying that we survived those years."
	"It depends on how you survived," Deputy Director Jin Junjie pointed out. "Just like Lao Yin said, trafficking in grain can also survive disasters!"
	"That's called a shameful means of exploitation," said Director Jin Junfeng, who came from a poor peasant background, indignantly. "When people are starving, he buys it at a low price and sells it at a high price. The poor are the ones who are starving, and they have to sell their houses and land to buy some grain. As the saying goes: lean years produce rich families, the poor become poorer, and the rich become richer. This isn't a matter of surviving disasters, it's a matter of drinking the blood of the poor! At that time, grain was in the hands of landlords, rich peasants, and some wealthy middle peasants. They controlled the grain, and they controlled the fate of the poor!"
	"What about now?" The big cannon Fang Qianji opened his mouth: "The Communist Party-led state controls the grain and guarantees that everyone has food to eat. During our three years of disaster, grain was transported from Sichuan to the Yangtze River, from the Yangtze River to Shanghai. It went by boat to Tianjin, then to Tanggu, and from Tanggu, it went by train to Fangshan Bridge. The shipping cost for one jin of grain was two and a half jin's worth of money, but it was still delivered to you for eight fen per jin. That's the benefit of unified purchase and sale!"

	(3) The Pirate Ship and the Socialist Ship
	More and more people were participating in the debate. Seeing the dark mass of people sitting in the room, Lao Yin couldn't help but feel a little flustered. He lowered his eyebrows and eyes and said in a low voice, "Everyone feels that one jin of grain is enough, and I feel even more that it's enough. Everyone feels satisfied, and I feel even more satisfied."
	"Lao Yin, you said that joining the cooperative was like getting on a pirate ship. Can you describe the pirate ship for everyone?" Jin Shouhai clarified the main point.
	"I didn't want to join the cooperative, but they forced me to. Joining it is like getting on a pirate ship," Lao Yin said hesitantly. "The way I see it," said the new middle peasant Jin Wencai slowly, "in the old society, our peasants were all drowning in mud and water, without food or clothing. Landlords, rich peasants, and some wealthy middle peasants were sailing on small boats, not getting wet and having food and drink. At this time, the socialist ship came, and the common people all boarded this big ship. This ship is big, and it can't withstand a jolt, so the landlords, rich peasants, and some wealthy middle peasants on those small boats all fell into the mud and water. There was no way, they had no choice but to board the big ship, but they always felt that it wasn't as comfortable and pleasant as sailing their own small boats."
	"Wencai is right, that's how it is." Several people nodded.
	"We poor and lower-middle peasants joined the cooperative and got on the socialist ship," said production team leader Li Shengde. "Like the deaf Lao Xiang, he hasn't left his house for several months and can't even take care of the sick. If he were farming on his own, he would definitely be living the life of a White-Haired Girl. This time, the cooperative took care of so many work points for him!"
	"Last year I went to Baoman Road to work, and my father died. My family didn't have any money, and the cooperative bought a coffin and helped bury him. If it were those years, I wouldn't even have enough to sell my family to pay for it!" Poor peasant Zhao Chengdi was participating in the debate for the first time. He had never been willing to talk much.
	Everyone spoke one after another, enumerating the benefits of the cooperative. Lao Yin kept silent. Or he would sigh about how his family had many people but few laborers, and how he had sold the elm and willow trees he had prepared to build a house last year to buy grain.
	Jin Shouhai couldn't bear it any longer and asked him directly, "You have bought several thousand jin of grain from the state for three consecutive years. If it were like those early years when you were farming on your own, how many trees would you have to sell to buy back these several thousand jin of grain?"
	It would have been better not to mention farming on one's own, but mentioning farming on one's own touched Lao Yin's sore spot. He sneered:
	"The land has its high and low points, and it's not necessarily all flooded. What if the harvest is a little better? It might be enough to eat!"
	Jin Junjie said "Oh" as if he understood. He immediately asked:
	"High, dry land can yield grain, but what about low-lying land?"
	"Sell the house, sell the land!" Lao Yin said casually.
	"What about those who have no land to sell?" "Just wait to starve to death!" At this moment, the crowd was outraged and shouted one after another. Everyone here knew that Lao Yin's family used to have all high, dry land that yielded harvests regardless of drought or flood. He bitterly opposed cooperativization, feeling sorry to have missed the chance to get rich.
	"You and Jin Zhao'er's family have all the high, dry land in the east of the village. During the three years of flooding, only your two families harvested crops, and everyone else had to starve. Is that fair?" Jin Xinzhai, the new middle peasant who had fired the first shot at the debate and complained about not having enough to eat, had completely turned around at this point and was indignantly questioning Lao Yin.
	"If we were farming on our own, Li Laoxi would have starved to death in these past few years. His family doesn't have a single piece of high, dry land. And the Xilin family, you can talk about them too!" Director Jin Junfeng, who was familiar with the land situation of the whole village, counted them off one by one.
	"Let me say something blunt," a low voice came from the corner of the room. People were surprised to find that it was Zhang Donghai, the village's skilled trumpet and flute player but who never attended meetings and was nicknamed "Old Stubborn," speaking: "My family also has all low-lying land. In the past, whenever I saw it raining, I was so worried that I couldn't sleep at all. In those years, we constantly ate chaff and vegetables, and we still had to sell our houses and land. If we hadn't joined the cooperative these past three years, I would have been begging for food long ago. This time, no matter what I do, I feel at ease. I can sleep soundly at night."
	"You all say my land is high, but others also have high land," Lao Yin insisted on defending himself.
	"That depends on how you look at it," Lao Qinghe said. "In the past, landlords and rich peasants had plenty of high, dry land. During disaster years, their families had stored grain, and others didn't, so they had to beg from them. Poor laborers who had three or five acres would have to sell it all. Those who planted high, dry land could get rich and take the capitalist road. It's not like that now. Taking the capitalist road means that one family laughs while several families cry!"
	Jin Junfeng summarized everyone's remarks and said: "The Communist Party leads us in establishing cooperatives to free our peasants from the poverty they've suffered for generations, to ensure that all 600 million people in China have food to eat, clothes to wear, and houses to live in, and to take the road of common prosperity, not the road of one family eating meat while several families starve to death. Lao Yin, as long as you work hard, in a few years your children will all grow up, and your life will become more and more prosperous! Let go of your dream of getting rich with your 18 acres of high, dry land, and work together with everyone to take the socialist road."
	Lao Yin lowered his head and had nothing more to say.

    驳倒左老印
    ——农村大辩论速写
    本报记者　金凤
             （一）“说一斤够的站那边去，
    不够的站这边来！”
    “老这么着，每人一斤，影响社会进步！”富裕中农左老印一开腔，立刻吸引了全场的注意。只见他眉飞色舞、笑嘻嘻对生产队长张福德说：“你说统购统销好，我也说好，就是使人们吃不饱。你扛着锄往地里一走，旁人看见准说‘还没睡醒啊？’更不用说干活了。所以少打了粮食，社会就走的慢了！”
    “我说说我的肚子和良心”，新中农赵香造发言了：“说肚子是真没饱。要讲良心，咱们闹了三年灾，人家翻山过海运了粮食来。咱们今年丰收了，想多吃，不供给灾区，这就叫忘恩负义！可是肚子又怎么办呐？找点菜糊搭着吃吃，紧巴紧的也就度过来了。”
    赵香造的这一顿肚子和良心，说得大伙尽是笑。会场的空气十分活泼，就是说不够吃的越发多了。富裕中农金桂贞叫得特别厉害。他说今年一年他的体重就抽了十六斤，再有二年他就要完了。
    掌握会场的金寿海和张福德，弄得毫无主意。金寿海试着转过湾来，他说：“咱们到是算算早先吃多少，统购统销吃多少？”
      “少呗”，左老印应声而答：“我饿的眼花缭乱。别的都好受，唯有这一斤难忍。”他见会场上多数人尽跟着他嚷不够吃，心里着实高兴，忍不住把憋在肚里几年的话都倒出来：“早先随随便便那时候，也闹过灾荒。民国九年闹大旱，有大客商买卖人就知道你缺粮，从远处运粮到望都，一囤一囤多着呢。我找个认识人说了说，套上个大车，要了个保人，没给钱，就拉来了几口袋。也有手头凑付不起的，可以扛长活呀！再不行，出去逃荒！”这时候，会场上开始不安静起来，有人小着声音说：“那不是贩卖粮食？”有人说：“逃荒，扛长活，穷人的死路！”可是左老印没有听到这些，却愈说愈兴奋：“早先那年头，逃荒的有的是，一家子一家子的逃到咱这来，三个五口地在门口站着。这个社会改变了，以人定量，都是一斤，你要饭我还没有呢。不信，你试试出去，用不了五天，准得把你饿死！”
    共青团员李金翠实在听不下去了，她说：“反正我是够吃了，这几年闹灾，我也一点没饿着！”
    “要是都觉得够了”，左老印轻蔑地吐了口唾沫：“再减一点，来个十二两怎样？”他见大家不啃声，又加了一句：“现在肚子节约，地也节约了一少打粮食呗！谁说一斤够吃的站那边去，不够的站这边来！”他放开嗓子吆喝着。
    “好，好，站出来，站出来”，富裕中农胡祥贵、金桂贞都站起来随声附和，会场上闹哄哄乱成一片。金寿海不得不赶紧宣布散会。
      （二）谁掌握了粮食的命运？
    “咱们都说不够吃，究竟要多少，咱们才够吃呢？”会议由副社长金俊杰主持了，他心中有底，问得十分沉着。
    “要想大伙扛着大旗，敲着太平锣，打着太平鼓，唱着太平歌下地去生产，每人至少二斤！”左老印说得十分顺溜，俨然代表着民意。
    老庆和猛的站起来，高声说：“一个人吃二斤，二斤打那里来？咱们村这点地，能出多少粮食，咱们得算算账，光要求不行！”
    “对，算账算账”，大伙全同意。于是，算盘找出来了，合作社的账去找出来了。算盘的的搭搭在响着，人们的心里也都在盘算着，全村二千口，按每人每天二斤，一年得吃一百四十四万斤，全村产粮一百零一万斤，除掉公粮种籽，剩下八十二万斤，和一百四十四万斤相差六十二万斤。
      “这么着，每人每天二斤，国家还得给咱村送六十二万斤来！今年还是丰收年，你说这笔账打那儿出呀？”老庆和不慌不忙问着左老印。
    左老印正无法对答，副社长金俊杰紧接着说：“咱们都嚷嚷不够吃，可是卖山药干的也不少。不够吃的话，为什么卖山药干，有的卖好几百斤（这时，会场上有些骚动，那个叫嚷一年抽了十六斤的富裕中农金桂贞在悄悄地溜到墙角落里去，看样子他怕点他的名，因为恰恰是他今年春上就卖过好几百斤山药干），有的挑着棒子到集上去卖。真的不够吃为什么还卖山药干？是按一斤吃的吗？谁也没按一斤吃！”
    接着又算了左老印和几家富裕中农的分粮账。左老印去年分粮四千五百九十斤，除掉饲料一百二十斤，还有四千四百七十斤，全家九口（内五个小孩），大人小孩平均每人一年四百九十六斤还多，一个月合四十一斤多。还有吵着说不够吃的金开，他家每人合一千三百多斤。还有金符合家每人分到一千四百多斤……。
    一笔一笔账算下去，社长金俊峰沉下声音来说：“咱们去年都吃了昧心粮了。吃了那么多，还说不够吃，咱们要吃多少才算够？”
    会场空气有些紧张，金俊杰又说开了：“上次老印提出度灾的几种办法：贩卖粮食、要饭、扛长活都比现在吃得好，大伙来讨论讨论。”
    “要饭可难哪”，扛过长活、要过饭的宋老和开口了：“一顿不出去就饿肚子，出去了也不准有，人们高兴给你点冷茶冷饭，不高兴就给你两句冷言冷语。要饱的时候着实稀少。天下顶数要饭吃难了。那时家里要有半斤四两粮食，也不出去要饭去！”
    “扛长活好？”屋角老贫农李老喜说时声音微微发抖：“我扛了四十年的长活，遭那罪就别提了。冷也得去，热也得去，刮风下雪下刀子也得去！俗话说得好：红眼熬瞎子，扛长活的熬花子：要不是共产党来，我就熬成花子了。”
    “宋老和你爹不就熬了个花子？”贫农王老国老汉指着宋老和：“还有王老连的爷爷，扛一辈子长活，眼瞎了。要不是这社会，他要饭吃连门都找不着，准得活活饿死！”
    “场光地了衣裳破，扛长活的啼哭东家乐呐”！李老喜说着声音都哽塞起来。全场的空气十分沉重。
    这时左老印活像一头关在笼中的野兽，在地上不住的走来走去。
    在上一个会上说着肚子和良心的赵香造也出来讲话了：“我小的时候也要过饭，我兄弟也跟着我去要。可现在他上了中学，参加工作去了。你说一斤不多，那年头谁要给我四两，我也不要饭去！”
    “我不是说要饭逃荒好”，左老印低声分辩：“我是说那年头也度过来了。”
    “看是怎么度法，就像老印说的贩运粮食也能度灾荒！”副社长金俊杰点了一句。
    “这叫做可耻的剥削手段”，贫农出身的社长金俊峰愤愤地说：“人家挨饿，他用小价买来，大价卖出。挨饿的是穷人，买点粮得卖房卖地。俗话说得好：贱年出富家，穷的添穷，富的添富，这不是度灾的问题，是喝穷人血的问题！那时粮食掌握在地主富农及一部分富裕中农的手里，他们掌握了粮食，就掌握了穷人的命运！”
    “现在怎么样？”大炮方千际开腔了：“共产党领导的国家掌握了粮食，保证人人有饭吃。咱们三年闹灾，粮食从四川运到长江，从长江运到上海，它坐轮船到了天津，然后到了塘沽，从塘沽它又上了火车到了房山桥。一斤粮食运费就得二斤半的钱，可是交到你手里还是八分钱一斤。这就是统购统销的好处！”
    （三）贼船和社会主义的大船
    参加辩论会的人，愈来愈多了。左老印见黑压压坐了一屋子的人，心里不免有些发慌。他低眉下眼，压低着嗓子说：“大伙都觉得一斤粮食够了，我更觉着够了。大伙觉得美满，我更觉得美满。”
    “老印你说入社是上了贼船了，你把贼船给大家比方比方。”金寿海点明正题。
    “入社我不愿意非叫入，入了就像上了贼船嚜。”左老印说得吞吞吐吐。“要照我看”，新中农金文才慢条斯理地说：“照先那社会，咱们农民都在泥里水里淹着浸着，没吃没穿。地主富农和一些富裕中农，驾着小船，淹不着又有吃有喝。这时候来了社会主义的大船，老百姓都上了这大船。这船个儿大，搁不住一晃荡，那些小船上的地主富农和些富裕中农，一个个都掉到泥里水里去了。没办法他们也只好上了大船，总觉得不如驾着自个儿的小船自在痛快。”
      “文才说得好，就是那么回事”。好几个人点着头。
    “我们贫雇农入社是上了社会主义的大船了”，生产队长李生德接口说：“就如聋老祥好几个月没出门，侍候病人都侍候不过来。要是单干他保险过上白毛女生活了。这回社给他照顾了多少工分！”
    “去年我上保满路做工，我爹死了，家里没有钱，社里给买了棺木，还帮助给埋了。要那年头，我把家去了也不够！”贫农赵成弟是第一回来参加辩论会，他向来不肯多说话。
    众人你一言我一语尽数说合作社的好处，左老印横直不开腔。要不就是叹他家人口多劳力少，去年卖了他准备修房的榆树、柳树来买粮。
    金寿海再也耐不住了，直问他：“你连着三年买国家好几千斤粮食，要像早先单干那阵，你卖几棵树能买得回这几千斤粮食？”
    这不提单干还好，一提单干可就触到左老印的痛处了。他冷笑一声：
    “地有高洼不平，不见得全涝着了。要是收成点呢？就许打的够吃！”
    金俊杰哦了一声，他这下全明白了，紧接着就问：
    “高干地能打粮食，低洼地怎么着？”
    “卖房呵，出地哪！”左老印轻描淡写地说着。
    “没地出的怎么样？”“尽等着饿死呵”？这一下群情激愤，纷纷叫起来了。这里谁都知道左老印家以前全是十八亩水旱都收的高干地。他死死反对合作化，敢情是痛惜错过他那发家致富的机会。
    “这东头就数你家和金兆二家尽是高干地，三年水灾，就你二家收了，别人都得饿死，这合理吗？”辩论会上打头一炮说不够吃的新中农金新宅这时完全转变过来，愤愤不平地质问着左老印。
    “要是单干，李老锡这几年准得饿死，他家一块高干地都没有。再一个锡林家，你也可以说说呀！”熟悉全村土地情况的社长金俊峰搬着指头一家家计数着。
    “我来说些骨头话”，从屋角发出一阵低沉的声音，人们惊讶地发现这是村里善于吹喇叭、吹笛但从不出席会议、外号老顽固的张东海在说话：“我家也尽是低洼地。以往我一见下雨，就愁的再也睡不着觉了。那年月，不断的吃糠咽菜，还断不了卖房出地。这三年要不入社，我早要了饭吃了。这回，不论干什么，我心里坦然着呢。夜里也睡个踏实觉啦”。
    “你们尽说我地高，别人也有地高的，”左老印还强嘴分辩。
    “这就得分那儿说”，老庆和说：“早先地主富农有的是高干地，灾年他们家有存粮，别人没有，就得量他的。穷棒子有个三亩五亩的，也就去光了。种高干地的可就发家致富，走了资本主义的道路。现在就不是这样了。走资本主义的道就得一家欢笑几家哭了！”
    金俊峰总结了大家的发言说：“共产党领导咱闹社，是要咱农民摆脱祖祖辈辈贫困的命运，要全中国六亿人都吃上饭，穿上衣，住上房子，走共同富裕的道路，不是一家吃肉，几家饿死的道路。老印你只要好好劳动，过几年你家孩子都长大成人，你的日子也会愈过愈富足！丢开你那凭十八亩高干地发家致富的梦想，和大伙同心合意走社会主义的道路吧。”
    左老印搭拉着脑袋，再没有话说了。
