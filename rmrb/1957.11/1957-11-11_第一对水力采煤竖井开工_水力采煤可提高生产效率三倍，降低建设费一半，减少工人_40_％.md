Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th. The construction of the wind shaft project of the No. 4 Mine in Hebi, Henan Province, China's first pair of hydraulic coal mining shafts, began on the 7th.

This pair of hydraulic coal mining shafts, with an annual output of 600,000 tons of coal, was designed with the help of Soviet hydraulic coal mining design institute director, Mochechnik, and other experts, along with Chinese engineering and technical personnel.

Hydraulic coal mining utilizes high-pressure water through water cannons to impact the coal seam to extract coal. It can triple production efficiency, reduce basic construction costs by half, reduce coal mining workers by 40%, and save a large amount of pit props.

    第一对水力采煤竖井开工
    水力采煤可提高生产效率三倍，降低建设费一半，减少工人40％
    新华社郑州10日电　我国第一对水力采煤竖井——河南省鹤壁四矿的风井工程7日动工兴建。
    这对年产六十万吨煤的水力采煤矿井，是苏联水力采煤设计研究院院长莫契尼克等专家帮助我国工程技术人员设计的。
    水力采煤是利用高压水通过水枪冲击煤壁来采煤的。它可以使生产效率提高三倍，基本建设费用降低一半，采煤工人减少40％，并且能节省大量坑木。
