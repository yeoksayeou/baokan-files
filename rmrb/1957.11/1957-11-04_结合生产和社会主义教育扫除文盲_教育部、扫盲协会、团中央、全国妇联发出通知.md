    Combine Production and Socialist Education to Eliminate Illiteracy
    Notices Issued by the Ministry of Education, Literacy Association, Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the All-China Women's Federation

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Ministry of Education, the National Association for the Elimination of Illiteracy, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the All-China Women's Federation recently issued notices to various regions concerning farmers' cultural education work for this winter and coming spring.

    The notices stated: This winter and spring, a large-scale production movement centered on farmland water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, as well as large-scale socialist education, should be universally carried out in rural areas. This is the central task in rural areas at present. Winter and spring are good times for farmers to learn culture. After the realization of cooperation, farmers are eager to improve their cultural level and have better learning conditions. For example, the production management of cooperatives has been further improved, and a large number of middle and primary school graduates and other educated people have participated in agricultural production, opening up a broad source of spare-time teachers. Farmers' spare-time cultural learning should be coordinated with the current rural large-scale production movement and socialist education, so as to ensure both the smooth completion of the central task and the continued advancement of farmers' spare-time cultural education.

    Regarding several major issues in farmers' spare-time cultural education work for this winter and spring, the notices pointed out:

    All regions should take a proactive attitude and, based on the original plan and current situation, propose specific plans for farmers' spare-time cultural learning (including literacy campaigns) for this winter and next year at each level, and start organizing the masses to enroll in schools.

    In the near future, all regions will organize discussions on the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Outline from 1956 to 1967. Based on the new spirit of the revised draft outline, all regions will revise or formulate twelve-year plans for farmers' spare-time cultural education (including literacy plans) and include them in the overall plan for agricultural production.

    The main task of farmers' spare-time cultural education in the next few years is to eliminate illiteracy. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of some farmers who want to further improve their cultural level after shaking off illiteracy, and to adapt to the continued learning needs of a large number of middle and primary school graduates who participate in agricultural production, all regions should also actively develop spare-time primary schools, appropriately organize spare-time secondary schools, and organize various forms of self-study groups based on specific conditions.

    Farmers' spare-time cultural education must be coordinated with socialist education. Cultural learning should be well arranged according to the different stages of the development of socialist education in rural areas. The content of cultural courses should be appropriately combined with the content of socialist education at that time and place, and regular current affairs and policy education should also be carried out, so that the organization of farmers' cultural learning becomes an important base for carrying out socialist education among farmers and publicizing the Party and government's various policies. In the work, attention should be paid to preventing two deviations: on the one hand, preventing inappropriately emphasizing cultural education and affecting the progress of political education; on the other hand, preventing only paying attention to political education and relaxing or even squeezing out cultural education.

    To enable farmers to learn culture well, it is necessary to help them squeeze out some spare time to study. This is a necessary condition to ensure that farmers learn culture well. Farmers are very busy with production and can only use their spare time to study. And farmers have to participate in some social and political activities in their spare time. Therefore, farmers' spare-time cultural learning should not only arrange time according to the seasonal slackness and tightness of production, but also cooperate appropriately with social and political activities. The spare time of farmers should be arranged in a unified way in a timely manner, so that neither is delayed. Learning organizations must take various forms. Those who can study in a concentrated way should study in a concentrated way; those who cannot study in a concentrated way should earnestly organize decentralized learning. For the masses participating in water conservancy construction and sideline production, they should be organized to study according to the actual situation and in suitable forms.

    Farmers' spare-time cultural education must rely on the leadership of townships, cooperatives, and production teams and follow the mass line to further mobilize the masses. Educational administrative departments at all levels should strengthen specific leadership over farmers' spare-time cultural education, help solve some of the difficulties in the work below, and pay attention to studying and summarizing experiences.

    The notices concluded by pointing out that organizations such as the Literacy Association, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation in various regions should attach importance to farmers' cultural education, earnestly mobilize their members to actively participate in this work, and cooperate with government education departments to supervise and inspect, which is of great importance for carrying out a wide-ranging, mass-based learning movement.

### 结合生产和社会主义教育扫除文盲  教育部、扫盲协会、团中央、全国妇联发出通知

    结合生产和社会主义教育扫除文盲
    教育部、扫盲协会、团中央、全国妇联发出通知
    本报讯　教育部、全国扫除文盲协会、共青团中央委员会和全国妇女联合会于最近向各地发出关于今冬明春农民文化教育工作的通知。
    通知中说：今冬明春在农村要普遍开展以兴修农田水利、积肥为中心的大生产运动和大规模的社会主义教育，这是目前农村的中心工作。冬、春两季本是农民学习文化的良好时机。实现合作化后，农民迫切要求提高文化水平，同时又有了较好的学习条件，如合作社生产管理的进一步改进，大批中、小学毕业生和其他有文化的人参加农业生产，给业余教师开辟了广阔的来源。农民业余文化学习应当同当前农村的大生产运动和社会主义教育配合起来进行，以求既不耽误中心任务的顺利完成，又要继续推进农民业余文化教育。
    对有关今冬明春农民业余文化教育工作中的几个主要问题，通知中指出：
    各地应当以积极的态度，根据原订规划和当前情况，逐级提出今冬和明年农民业余文化学习（包括扫盲）的具体计划，并且着手组织群众入学。
    各地在最近期间，将组织讨论1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要修正草案，各地根据纲要修正草案新的精神来修订或制订农民业余文化教育的十二年规划（包括扫盲规划），并且把它列入农业生产的总体规划中。
    今后几年内农民业余文化教育的主要任务是扫除文盲。同时为了满足一部分农民在摆脱文盲状态之后，进一步提高文化水平的要求，为了适应大量中、小学毕业生参加农业生产后，继续学习文化的要求，各地还应当根据具体条件，积极发展业余小学，适当举办业余中学，并且组织各种形式的自学小组。
    农民业余文化教育必须同社会主义教育相配合，根据农村社会主义教育进展的不同阶段，很好地安排文化学习。文化课的内容要同当时当地社会主义教育内容适当结合起来，并且还要进行经常性的时事、政策教育，使农民文化学习的组织，成为向农民进行社会主义教育和宣传党和政府的各项政策的重要阵地。在工作中要注意防止两种偏向：一方面要防止不适当地强调文化教育，影响政治教育的进行；另一方面，也要防止只注意政治教育，放松甚至挤掉文化教育的现象。
    要使农民学好文化，必须帮助他们挤出一部分业余时间来学习。这是保证农民学好文化的一个必要条件。农民生产很忙，只能利用生产的余暇时间学习。而农民在业余时间还要参加一些社会政治活动。因此农民的业余文化学习，既要按各个季节生产的闲忙松紧情况来安排时间，又要和社会政治活动作适当的配合。对农民的业余时间就要及时地作统一安排，两不耽误。学习组织必须采取多种多样形式，能够集中学习的就集中学习；不能集中学习的应当认真地组织分散学习。对于参加水利建设和副业生产的群众，要根据实际情况，采取适合的形式，组织他们学习。
    农民业余文化教育一定要依靠乡、社、生产队的领导和走群众路线，进一步发动群众。各级教育行政部门应当加强对农民业余文化教育工作的具体领导，帮助下面解决工作中的一些困难问题，注意研究总结经验。
    通知最后指出：各地扫除文盲协会、共青团、妇联等组织，应当重视农民文化教育工作，要认真发动自己的成员积极参加这一工作，并协同政府教育部门进行督促检查，这对于开展广泛的、群众性的学习运动，有着重要的作用。
