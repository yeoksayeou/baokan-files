Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 29th: A national convention of Japanese manufacturers demanding the immediate conclusion of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was held in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 28th.

　　This convention was jointly held by more than 130 economic organizations, including the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, the Japan-China Import and Export Association, the Wuhan and Guangzhou Japan Commodity Exhibition, the Japan-China Machinery Trade Liaison Council, the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, the Japan Local Assembly Members' League for the Promotion of International Trade, and twenty Chambers of Commerce, as well as the governors of seven prefectures and cities including Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Niigata, and the mayors of seventeen cities. More than 300 people attended the conference, including representatives from the trade and industry sectors, manufacturer representatives, members of the Diet, local assembly members, and mayors.

　　The conference passed a resolution strongly urging the Japanese government to strive to conclude the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement within the year. The resolution stated that since Sino-Japanese trade fell into a state of no agreement, various obstacles have arisen in trade operations. And at a time when China is about to begin its Second Five-Year Plan for economic construction, and Western European countries are actively engaged in trade with China, this state of no agreement is a matter of deep concern to us.

　　The resolution pointed out that a trade agreement is indispensable for conducting large-scale trade with China. Therefore, the conclusion of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement is a pressing issue that remains to be resolved.

　　The resolution requested the Japanese government to take measures to eliminate obstacles in the issue of establishing commercial representative offices in each other's countries in order to develop Japan's trade and enhance the friendship between Japan and China, and to strive to sign the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement within the year.

　　The conference also decided to establish an implementation committee to vigorously implement the resolutions of the conference. The conference elected Kumaichi Yamamoto, Chairman of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, Shigeyoshi Takami, Executive Director of the Japan-China Import and Export Association, Kazuo Suzuki, Executive Director of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, Eiichi Yadoya, Chairman of the Wuhan and Guangzhou Japan Commodity Exhibition, and many manufacturer representatives and local representatives as members of the implementation committee.

　　The conference also passed a resolution calling for the promotion of mutual commodity exhibitions in each other's countries between Japan and China.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 29th: People from various Tokyo organizations who have visited China held a meeting on the evening of the 28th and formed the Tokyo Visiting China Persons Consultation Association.

　　The meeting decided that the new organization will strive to unite Japanese people who have visited China in order to promote the movement to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and decided that the current focus should be on actively launching a campaign to welcome the Chinese Red Cross delegation and the Beijing Municipal delegation to visit Japan.

　　Participants in the meeting included Akira Kazami, Chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, Hachimanyuu Yamaya, Chairman of the Local Assembly Members' League for the Promotion of International Trade, as well as about forty people who have visited China from the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly Workers' Union, cultural organizations, economic organizations, and other groups.

    日本一百多经济团体要求政府立即缔结第四次日中贸易协定
    据新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本全国厂商要求立即缔结第四次日中贸易协定大会于28日下午在东京举行。

    大会通过决议，强烈要求日本政府争取在年内缔结第四次日中贸易协定。决议说，自从日中贸易陷入无协定状态以后，在贸易业务上发生了种种障碍。并且正当中国要开始进行第二个五年计划的经济建设，西欧各国向中国积极地进行贸易的时候，这种无协定状态是值得我们深感忧虑的。
    决议指出，要想同中国进行大规模的贸易，贸易协定是不可缺少的。因此，缔结第四次日中贸易协定正是尚待解决的紧要问题。
    决议要求日本政府为了发展日本的贸易和增进日中两国的友好，赶紧采取措施消除在互设通商代表机构问题上的障碍，争取在年内签订第四次日中贸易协定。
    大会同时决定要设立一个实行委员会，强有力地实现大会的决议。大会选出了日本国际贸易促进协会会长山本熊一、日中输出入协会专务理事高见重义、中日贸易会专务理事铃木一雄、武汉广州日本商品展览会理事长宿谷荣一和许多厂商代表以及地方代表为实行委员会的委员。
    大会还通过了一项要求促进实现日中两国互相在对方国家里举行商品展览会的决议。
    据新华社29日讯　东京消息：曾经访问过中国的东京各团体人士在28日晚上举行会议，组成了东京访华人士恳谈会。
    会议决定，这个新的组织将努力团结访问过中国的日本人士，以便推进恢复日中邦交运动，并且决定当前要努力展开欢迎中国红十字会代表团和北京市代表团访问日本的运动。
    参加会议的有，恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章、地方议员促进国际贸易联盟会长山屋八万雄、以及东京都议会议员工会、文化团体、经济团体和其他团体中曾经访问过中国的人士等约计四十人。
