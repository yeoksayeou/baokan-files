Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

The Twenty-sixth Township of Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, is located in the Cailiang Mountain area near the ancient Great Wall. In the past, this area was full of barren mountains and ridges, suffering from severe soil erosion and infertile land. After the realization of cooperatives in 1956, the township's farmers built terraced fields, constructed check dams, sowed seeds on barren mountains, and planted trees and cultivated forests, resulting in more than 20,000 mu of land controlling soil erosion, more than 13,900 mu of new terraced fields, and forests of seedlings. Furthermore, on this basis, they increased fertilizer application many times over, expanded the planting of high-yield crops, improved farming techniques, and developed diversified economic activities, achieving bumper harvests for two consecutive years. The entire township has transformed from a grain-deficient area to a grain-surplus area, selling a total of 120,000 jin of surplus grain to the state this year. With the increase in income, the economic life of the township's farmers has greatly improved, the number of civil schools and primary school students has increased, and a complete primary school has been added.

    采梁山区面貌改观
    据新华社讯　山西阳高县二十六乡在靠近古长城的采梁山区。过去，这里全是童山秃岭，水土流失严重，土地瘠薄。1956年实现合作化后，全乡农民修梯田、建谷坊、荒山播种、植树育林，出现了两万多亩控制水土流失的土地，一万三千九百多亩新梯田和成片林苗；并且在这个基础上，成倍地增施肥料，扩大种植高产作物，改良耕作技术和发展多种经济，两年来连获丰收，全乡已由缺粮变为余粮，今年共出售余粮十二万斤给国家。随着收入增加，全乡农民经济生活大改善，民校、初小学生增加了，并且添设了一所完全小学。
