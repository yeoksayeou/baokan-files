Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st - Shanxi Province's economic sectors are actively supporting rural areas in the construction of farmland water conservancy projects.

    The Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce recently inspected supply work and transported a large number of materials needed for farmland water conservancy construction to the worksites. The Provincial Coal Construction Company has already shipped more than 2,000 tons of cement for farmers to use in building canals and reservoirs. In addition to supplying a large quantity of lead wire and wire nails, the Hardware Company has also supplied more than 100,000 shovels, pickaxes, and other tools. Local timber companies have recently relaxed timber purchase specifications, purchasing large quantities of small timber to supply rural areas for the construction of dams and water retaining protection projects. In addition, the Petroleum Company has also increased the supply of petroleum and diesel to meet the needs of well drilling and other water conservancy projects for lighting and power.

    The Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce is cooperating with agricultural and water conservancy departments to formulate a plan to support basic farmland water conservancy construction. Recently, after learning that the province needed more than 520,000 bamboo poles for well drilling alone, they immediately began organizing the supply. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently convened a provincial production materials supply meeting to deploy the province's supply work. The Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Cooperative also recently instructed its grassroots cooperatives to actively contact agricultural cooperatives to support the tools needed for agricultural capital construction this winter and next spring, and to repair and fit tools.

    Most areas of Shanxi Province suffered reduced harvests this year due to disasters. To help agricultural cooperatives in these areas solve the financial difficulties in basic construction, the Shanxi Branch of the People's Bank of China will issue more than 31 million yuan in loans this winter and next spring. Recently, it also issued instructions to county branches, emphasizing that support for basic farmland water conservancy construction should be the focus of national and credit cooperative loan issuance.

    山西省商业厅同农业水利部门联系合作，制订支援农田水利基本建设的计划。最近，他们了解到全省仅打井竹竿就需要五十二万多根后，立即开始组织货源。省供销合作社最近召开全省生产资料供应会议，部署了全省供应工作。山西省手工业合作社最近也指示各基层社，积极同农业社联系，支援今冬明春农业基本建设所需的工具和对工具的修配。
