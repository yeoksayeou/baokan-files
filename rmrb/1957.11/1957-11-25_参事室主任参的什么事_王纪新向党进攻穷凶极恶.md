On the Anti-Rightist Struggle Front:

    This newspaper reports: The Ministry of Internal Affairs convened six plenary staff meetings at the end of October to expose and criticize the consistent reactionary words and deeds of Wang Jixin, the rightist and director of the Counselor's Office of the ministry.

    Taking advantage of the Party's rectification movement, Wang Jixin rabidly attacked the Party, unleashing a total of three poisonous arrows.

    The first poisonous arrow slanderously claimed that the Communist Party was not a proletarian party, but a feudal sectarian group. He cursed the Communist Party as being "of a family nature, a clan-based gang." He said, "Speaking in terms of the entire Party, the remnants of feudal forces are the main element, because China has not gone through a stage of bourgeois dictatorship," and "it is difficult to understand the nature of a proletarian party without understanding the nature of a bourgeois party." He also clamored, "Communist Party members join the Party out of self-interest, using the Party for personal gain, and behaving with a 'those who are not with me are against me' attitude both inside and outside the Party, forming factions and attacking dissenters."

    The second poisonous arrow released by Wang Jixin was to attack and oppose the Communist Party's leading position in the Chinese revolutionary movement and in the nation's political life. He slanderously claimed that the Communist Party used to "take over the world" and now "governs the world," "from the base areas to the present, from the central government to the grassroots, the Party replaces the government, with titles but no real power." He also slandered the Party's political and ideological education work, saying, "The Party's education of non-Party members is only of two kinds: either a violent storm or no wind or rain."

    The third poisonous arrow released by Wang Jixin was an attack on China's people's democratic legal system. With ulterior motives, Wang Jixin divided the legal community into so-called "Party legal circles and non-Party legal circles," and based on the theory of legal harmony, proposed: "At present, we should smash the two clay Buddhas, mix them with water, and then sculpt two more clay Buddhas, with you in me and me in you." At a forum of the Political Science and Law Association, he openly stated: "If we say that judicial reform is the Party dismantling the walls of non-Party legal circles, then now it should be non-Party members dismantling the walls of Party legal circles."

### 参事室主任参的什么事  王纪新向党进攻穷凶极恶

    参事室主任参的什么事
    王纪新向党进攻穷凶极恶
    本报讯　内务部于10月末召开了六次全体工作人员大会，揭露并批判了该部参事室主任、右派分子王纪新的一贯反动言行。
    王纪新乘党整风的机会，猖狂地向党进攻，他一共放出三支毒箭。
    第一支毒箭诬蔑说共产党不是无产阶级政党，而是一个封建宗派集团。咒骂共产党是“家族的性质，宗族的帮会”。说什么“在全党范围来讲，封建残余势力占主要，因为中国没有经过资产阶级专政阶段”，“不了解资产阶级政党的性质也就难于理解无产阶级政党的性质”。他还叫嚣说：“共产党员是从切身利益出发参加党的，借党营私，在党内外都表现为非我即敌，党同伐异”。
    王纪新放的第二支毒箭，是攻击和反对共产党在中国革命运动中及在国家政治生活中的领导地位。他诬蔑共产党过去“包打天下”，现在又是“包治天下”，“从根据地到现在，从中央到基层都是以党代政，有职无权”。他还诬蔑党的政治思想教育工作，说：“党对党外人士的教育只有两种，一是狂风暴雨，一是无风无雨”。
    王纪新放的第三支毒箭，是攻击我国人民民主法制。王纪新别有用心地把法学界分为所谓“党内法学界和党外法学界”，并以法的调和论为根据，提出：“目前应当是打碎两尊泥菩萨，和上水，再塑起两尊泥菩萨，你中有我，我中有你”。在政法学会的座谈会上，他公然提出：“如果说司法改革是党内拆党外法学界的墙，那末现在应该是党外拆党内法学界的墙”。
