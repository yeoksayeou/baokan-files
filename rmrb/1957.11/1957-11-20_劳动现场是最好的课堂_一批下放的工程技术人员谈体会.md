Xinhua News Agency, November 18th: The first group of engineering technicians downwardly-transferred from the Beijing Municipal Planning Bureau Design Institute generally feel that the labor site is the best classroom for the ideological remolding of intellectuals.

This group of engineering technicians was downwardly-transferred in mid-October, totaling one hundred and seventy-eight people, accounting for nearly one-third of the total number of engineering technicians in the entire institute. Among them were fourteen engineers, ninety technicians and assistant technicians, and seventy-four trainees and interns. One hundred and forty-one people became workers at basic construction sites, and more than thirty people became farmers. Over the past month or so, this group of engineering technicians has overcome many difficulties, and their labor efficiency has been continuously improved. Some have approached the level of ordinary strong laborers, and some have reached the level of medium labor force in rural areas.

**Mental Labor is Not "Superior"**

Among the engineering technicians who were downwardly-transferred to the construction site of the Soviet Embassy in Beijing as construction workers, many used to regard mental labor as "superior" and looked down on physical labor. This time, after experiencing digging soil, carrying soil, sifting stones, and moving equipment, they realized that if it were not for the blood and sweat of millions of working people, their designs would be nothing more than a few scraps of paper. Du Chun, a technician who was known for being "gluttonous and lazy" in the design institute in the past, realized this time that every grain of rice and every vegetable leaf is hard-won, and expressed that he would好好 (hǎo hāo - do well/thoroughly) remold himself through labor for a long time. Now, he is not only working enthusiastically at the construction site, but also helping with housework on Sundays; in the past, he never did any housework at home.

**Negated the "Personal Monument" Ideology**

Many engineering technicians were also educated by the exemplary actions of construction workers, such as cherishing public property and self-sacrifice. One engineer said that in the past, many of them had the idea of establishing a "personal monument" in their designs, and rarely cared for and helped each other. This time, he discovered that the workers on the construction site who were paid on a piecework basis would put down their own work and come to teach them when they saw that these new workers were not skilled in their operations, which made him both moved and ashamed. Now, the engineering technicians who have been downwardly-transferred to this construction site as workers have begun to form a atmosphere of mutual care and mutual assistance.

**Business Can Be Improved Through Labor**

Many engineering technicians have also learned knowledge from labor that they could not learn from books, and their design ideas have undergone great changes. They have a deep understanding of how to implement the policy of thrift in design. They said that if they had realized the arduousness of physical labor earlier, they could have greatly reduced the errors of "big roofs" and "formalism" in the past. Engineers Zhang Depai and Zhou Zhiliang used to think that earth excavation did not cost much labor, so they did not pay enough attention to how to better use the terrain and reduce the amount of earthwork in the design. This time, after personally participating in physical labor, they realized that it takes so much effort to dig one cubic meter of soil. They said: "You can't realize this without participating in labor." Many technicians also deeply realized the importance of close cooperation between design and construction and reducing drawing errors from their personal labor experience, and also learned some specific construction knowledge. They believe that this is of great help to improving their design level.

**A Good Way to Prolong Life**

After more than a month of labor, the weight of these engineering technicians has generally increased, and their arms have become strong and powerful. In particular, many people's original neurasthenia and stomach problems have been cured. They said: Participating in physical labor can add several years to your life.

    劳动现场是最好的课堂
    一批下放的工程技术人员谈体会
    据新华社18日讯　北京市城市规划局设计院第一批下放的工程技术人员，普遍体会到劳动现场是知识分子思想改造的最好的课堂。
    这批工程技术人员是在10月中旬下放的，共一百七十八人，占全院工程技术人员总数将近三分之一。他们之中有工程师十四人，技术员和助理技术员九十人，练习生和实习生七十四人。有一百四十一人当了基本建设工地的工人，三十多人当了农民。一个多月来，这批工程技术人员克服了许多困难，劳动效率不断提高，有的已接近普通壮工的水平，有的达到了农村中等劳动力的水平。
    脑力劳动并非“高人一等”
    下放到北京苏联大使馆工地当建筑工人的工程技术人员中，不少人过去把脑力劳动看作“高人一等”，轻视体力劳动；这次经过挖土、担土、筛石子、搬器材等劳动，才体会到如果不是经过千百万劳动人民的流血流汗，他们的设计不过是几张废纸而已。过去在设计院以“好吃懒做”出名的技术员杜椿，这次体会到一粒米、一个菜叶子都是来之不易，表示要长期在劳动中好好改造自己。现在他不但在施工现场劳动得很起劲，而且星期天还帮助家里干活；过去他在家里是从来不干活的。
    否定了“个人纪念碑”思想
    许多工程技术人员还从建筑工人们那种爱护公共财产、自我牺牲等模范行动中受到了教育。一位工程师说，过去他们很多人有在设计中树立“个人纪念碑”的思想，互相之间很少关心和帮助；这次他发现工地上实行计件工资的工人，看到他们这些新工人操作不熟练，就放下自己的工作，跑过来教他们，这使他又感动又惭愧。现在，下放到这个工地当工人的工程技术人员们，已开始形成一种互相关心、互相帮助的风气。
    劳动中可以提高业务
    许多工程技术人员在劳动中还学到了从书本上学不到的知识，设计思想上起了很大变化，对于在设计中如何贯彻节约方针有了深刻的认识。他们说，如果早点体会到体力劳动这样艰巨，他们在过去就可以大大减少“大屋顶”、“形式主义”等的错误了。张德沛、周治良等工程师过去认为挖土方费不了多少工，因此怎样在设计中更好地利用地势、减少土方工作量一直注意不够。这次他们亲自参加体力劳动以后，才感到挖一公方的土要费这么大的力气。他们说：“不参加劳动是体会不到这一点的。”许多技术人员从亲身劳动的经历中，还深切体会到了设计和施工密切配合、减少图纸错误的重要性，并且学到了一些具体的施工方面的知识。他们认为这对提高他们的设计水平有很大帮助。
    延年益寿的好办法
    经过一个多月的劳动，这些工程技术人员的体重有了普遍的增加，两只臂膀也开始强健有力。特别是许多人原来的神经衰弱症、胃病都好了。他们说：参加了体力劳动，可以多活好几年。
