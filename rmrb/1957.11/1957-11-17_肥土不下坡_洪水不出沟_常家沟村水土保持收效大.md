"Fertile Soil Doesn't Run Downhill, Floodwaters Don't Leave the Gully"
Changjiagou Village Achieves Great Results in Soil and Water Conservation

    (Our Newspaper dispatch) Relying on collective strength, the peasants of Changjiagou Village in Huaian County, Hebei Province, have successfully transformed a poor mountain gully.

    Changjiagou Village is located on the south bank of the Dongyang River. Before the cooperative movement, soil erosion was severe, and gullies crisscrossed the land. The 2,298 mu of cultivated land here were divided into more than 4,600 plots, scattered across more than 30 small hills and slopes. The annual yield per unit area of cultivated land was only 85 jin. The peasants' lives were very hard. The saying "Poor mountains and bad waters lead to no future" and "No development without moving to the plains" was popular among the peasants. The peasants of Changjiagou Village have a long history of fighting against the disasters of soil erosion. The father of peasant Wu Jialin used the method of gradually increasing the height of a dam in a collapsed pit. After more than 40 years, the father died and the son continued the work, constantly repairing it. Now the earth dam has been raised to 16.5 meters, forming 1.4 mu of reed field, which yields more than 200 yuan in reed mat income every year. However, in the era of private land ownership, the peasants did not have the strength to fundamentally manage the large areas of barren hillsides and gullies. Soil erosion continued to plague this small mountain village.

    In order to help the people in the mountainous areas develop them, Huaian County decided to conduct a pilot project of soil and water conservation in Changjiagou Village. In 1954, 37 gully control dams, three to eight meters high, were built here. Due to low technical skills and substandard engineering, 12 gully control dams were washed away by mountain floods in the summer of the following year. In the winter of 1955, advanced cooperatives were established, and the soil and water conservation work in Changjiagou Village shifted from simply treating the gullies to comprehensive management. In 1956, an unprecedented upsurge of soil and water conservation appeared in Changjiagou Village. Throughout the year, a large number of various soil and water conservation projects, such as gully control dams, fish-scale pits, contour ditches, field ridges, terraced fields, reservoirs, and canals, were built. More than 220,000 trees were also planted. More than 23,000 workdays were used on these projects. Before the spring plowing this year, many more soil and water conservation projects were built. Over the past two years, more than 27,900 workdays have been spent on soil and water conservation, and the projects built have initially controlled soil erosion over an area of four square kilometers, beginning to achieve "fertile soil doesn't run downhill, floodwaters don't leave the gully," and agricultural production has been guaranteed. Last year, the per-mu yield of land throughout the cooperative increased from 85 jin before liberation to 103 jin. Li Fengtong's 1.5 mu of silted land yielded more than 300 jin of grain per mu. The trees planted two or three years ago are now four to five chi tall. Li Fengchang planted more than two mu of trees on silted land. In the past three years, in addition to an income of 196 yuan, he also had firewood for his own use, and he also raised four sheep with the leaves. The peasants have high confidence in developing the mountainous areas. In September of this year, leading party and government cadres from various special districts in Hebei Province and representatives of mountain peasants visited Changjiagou Village one after another to prepare to promote the experience of soil and water conservation in Changjiagou.

### “肥土不下坡  洪水不出沟”  常家沟村水土保持收效大

    “肥土不下坡  洪水不出沟”
    常家沟村水土保持收效大
    本报讯  河北省怀安县常家沟农民依靠集体力量，成功地改造了穷山沟。
    常家沟村位于东洋河南岸，合作化前水土冲刷严重，沟壑纵横。这里的二千二百九十八亩耕地，被分割为四千六百多块，分布在三十多个小山头和山坡上。常年耕地单位面积产量只有八十五斤。农民生活很苦。在农民中流行着“穷山恶水没出息”“不到平川没发展”的说法。常家沟村农民同水土流失的灾害作斗争，有很久的历史。农民武加林的父亲曾经用逐年加高的办法在塌土坑洞修了一座坝，经过四十多年，父死子继，不断整修，现在土坝已加高到十六公尺半，淤成了一亩四分苇田，每年可得苇席收入二百多元。但是，在土地私有制的时代，对于大片的荒山坡沟，农民没有力量去进行根本治理。水土流失仍然危害着这个小山村。
    为了帮助山区人民建设山区，怀安县决定在常家沟村进行水土保持试点。1954年，这里筑起了三至八公尺高的沟内谷坊三十七道。由于水技低，工程不合标准，第二年夏季，有十二道谷坊被山洪冲毁。1955年冬季实现了高级合作化，常家沟村的水土保持工作才由单纯的治沟转为综合治理。1956年，常家沟村出现了空前的水土保持高潮，全年修筑了大量的谷坊、鱼鳞坑、水平沟、地埂、梯田、蓄水池、渠道等各种水土保持工程，还栽了二十二万多棵树，这些工程上共用了二万三千多个工作日。今年春耕前，又修了很多水土保持工程。两年来，在水土保持上用工达两万七千九百多个，所筑工程初步控制了水土流失面积达四平方公里，开始做到了“肥土不下坡、洪水不出沟”，农业生产得到了保障。去年，全社的每亩土地产量已由解放前的八十五斤增加到一百零三斤。李凤桐种的一亩半淤地，每亩产粮三百多斤。两三年前栽的树，现在已长到四、五尺高了。李凤昌在淤地上栽树二亩多，三年来除收入了一百九十六元外，自己烧柴也有了，还用树叶养了四只羊。农民们建设山区的信心很高。今年9月，河北省各专区的党政领导干部和山区农民代表，接二连三地到常家沟村参观，准备推广常家沟水土保持的经验。
