To push the socialist ideological education movement to a new high tide, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued supplementary instructions on further carrying out the socialist education movement on the 26th. The instructions require that all localities should combine the current socialist education movement with large-scale farmland water conservancy construction, manure accumulation campaigns, organizing a winter production high tide, production for disaster relief and economical ways to survive the famine in disaster areas, as well as long-term planning measures (the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Development Program). The instructions also require that the above-mentioned important tasks should be used as the content of socialist education to launch a "speaking out freely and airing views" debate, thoroughly resolve ideological problems, and truly make socialist education the ideological foundation and driving force for completing various tasks, launching a socialist ideological education high tide and a winter production high tide simultaneously, promoting each other.

To this end, all localities should conduct an inspection and summary of the previous stage of socialist education in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's Eighth Plenary Session's Third Session regarding rectification instructions, and redeploy the next stage of socialist education in accordance with the current new situation and tasks. Regarding the content of ideological education, the instructions point out that regardless of the type of area, the focus should be on mobilizing and organizing a winter production high tide, with production and disaster relief as the focus in disaster areas, to carry out "speaking out freely and airing views" debate. When organizing the "speaking out freely and airing views" debate, do not remain stuck on some of the original disputed issues, such as whether 360 catties of grain is enough to eat, or whether cooperativization is superior or not. Because these issues have now been basically resolved, the debate should be elevated to the issue of two roads on production issues, and the superiority of cooperativization should be demonstrated through production actions. The instructions point out: It is necessary to emphasize close integration with grassroots rectification and communalization work, use the spirit of rectification to mobilize and organize extensive "speaking out freely and airing views" and debate, and earnestly grasp rectification and reform.

    把冬季生产作为辩论中心内容
    山东省委发布农村整风补充指示
    本报济南31日电　为把社会主义思想教育运动推向新的高潮，中共山东省委于26日发布了关于进一步开展社会主义教育运动的补充指示。指示中要求各地应当把当前的社会主义教育运动和开展大规模农田水利基本建设、积肥运动、组织冬季生产高潮、灾区的生产救灾节约渡荒，以及长远的规划措施（农业发展纲要四十条）等项任务结合起来，并以上述各项重要任务，作为社会主义教育内容展开鸣放辩论，彻底解决思想问题，使社会主义教育确实成为完成各项工作的思想基础与动力，把社会主义思想教育高潮与冬季生产高潮同时掀起，相互推动。
    为此，各地应根据党的八届三中全会关于整风指示精神，对前段社会主义教育进行一次检查总结，按照当前新的情况和任务，重新布署下段社会主义教育。对思想教育的内容，指示中指出无论那一类地区，都应以动员组织冬季生产高潮为中心，灾区则以生产救灾为中心，进行鸣放辩论。在组织鸣放辩论时，不要仍停留在原来争论的一些问题上，如粮食三百六十斤够不够吃，合作化优越不优越等。因为这些问题，现在已经基本解决了，应当提高到解决生产问题上的两条道路问题，应通过生产的行动，证明合作化的优越性。指示中指出：要强调紧密结合基层整风整社工作，以整风的精神来动员组织大鸣大放大争，切实抓紧整改。
