Our newspaper, Kunming, 25th Dispatch: The Shangsuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jinning County, Yunnan, conscientiously ensured that rectification and production did not hinder each other.

After the great airing of views, great contending, and great debates, the Shangsuan Agricultural Cooperative quickly entered the rectification phase. The cooperative leadership compiled the more than 19,000 opinions raised by the masses during the airing of views. Among these opinions, those related to the cooperative's production plans and management accounted for over 60%. The various opinions could be divided into four major categories: (1) completely correct and able to be corrected immediately, accounting for approximately 60%; (2) completely correct but currently unresolvable, accounting for approximately 30%; (3) one-sided opinions requiring careful explanation and completely incorrect opinions, accounting for approximately 10%. The cooperative studied a plan for further improving work and addressed the opinions raised by the masses, correcting what could be corrected immediately and explaining to the masses what could not be corrected temporarily. The cooperative convened a meeting of cooperative members, where the township government, the Party general branch, the cooperative management committee, and the responsible personnel of each production team expressed their determination to rectify and announced the items that could be immediately changed on the spot. For example, the food company would slaughter pigs in the township, saving cooperative members time from going to market; designated areas were set aside for cooperative members to cut firewood, preventing indiscriminate cutting and ensuring firewood supply; the doctor established a system of rotating visits to the countryside; and in terms of the cooperative's production plans, the suggestions of cooperative members to increase tobacco fields and convert land into paddy fields were adopted, with plans to expand small seedling fields by 10% next year. At the same time, the meeting also dealt with the embezzlement and theft of three production team leaders and a credit cooperative director. In accordance with the opinions of the cooperative members, hooligans and lazybones were subjected to compulsory labor management, allowing them to earn food rations monthly based on their work points. To date, the Shangsuan Cooperative has improved its work based on more than two thousand opinions from the masses and has also used completely incorrect opinions to clarify right and wrong among the cooperative members.

After more than half a month of rectification, the Shangsuan Agricultural Cooperative organized cooperative members to study the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and revised and formulated a ten-year agricultural development long-term plan and a 1958 production plan. When planning the long-term vision, the masses were extremely enthusiastic, generally believing that all aspects of the agricultural cooperative had been improved. The cooperative members looked forward to the future, and their confidence in building the mountainous areas was even greater. During the rectification process, more than 85% of the cooperative members put forward rationalization proposals, and production enthusiasm was particularly high. In previous years, after the autumn harvest and autumn planting, many people always clamored for a rest, but this year, they quickly transitioned to winter production after the autumn harvest. The labor attendance rate of the cooperative's twenty-five production teams increased from about 80% to 95%, and the working hours generally remained above eight hours. The cooperative organized two large teams for water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, with more than 1,300 people mobilized daily to build water conservancy projects and dig grass coal. Land conversion to paddy fields, tobacco field conversion, fertilizer accumulation, and other production-increasing measures were carried out ahead of schedule.

Our newspaper, Kunming, 25th Dispatch: The Chunhe Cooperative in Yuxi County, Yunnan, vigorously rectified, promoting production.

During the rectification phase, the cooperative cadres and production team leaders of the Chunhe Cooperative had a relatively clear understanding of the importance of rectification. They realized that failing to correct shortcomings "would create a wall between them and the masses, while correction would unite them as one," and that "with everyone united, barren land could be turned into gold." Therefore, they analyzed the opinions of cooperative members every day, correcting what could be corrected immediately. To date, work has been improved based on 406 opinions from the masses.

In the work of collecting old wall soil to compress fields, everyone was initially very active, with more than 600 people working. However, after a few days, only about 200 people remained. Cooperative members pointed out that the work points were set too low, there was no difference in the distance traveled, and the measuring ruler was not uniform, with some strong laborers only earning five or six points a day. The cooperative management committee studied the situation, re-adjusted the quota based on the distance traveled to work, and unified the ruler, so that ordinary strong laborers could earn about ten points a day. As a result, the number of people carrying soil suddenly increased to more than 800.

The cooperative management committee planned to reclaim 300 mu of wasteland, but the enthusiasm of cooperative members was not high due to the remote location and poor soil quality. Cooperative members said that those lands "yield only a handful for every gourd planted, what's the point of planting," and that "the nearby wastelands, although fragmented, have fertile soil and are easier to manage." The cooperative management committee accepted this opinion, revised the plan, and the production teams also became active.

In the past, lazy people were given food rations as usual, which cooperative members strongly opposed, believing that the lazy people's food rations should be managed and given to them only after they worked. The cooperative management committee studied this issue and decided that the lazy people's food rations would be kept by the cooperative, and they would be given a month's worth of food rations for every twenty workdays, with deductions for fewer days worked. This not only satisfied the cooperative members, but also motivated the lazy people to work actively.

The cooperative originally raised 400 pigs, but later sold 200, and the cooperative cadres were reluctant to raise more pigs because they thought it required advances of funds. Cooperative members pointed out that without raising pigs, there would be no fertilizer accumulation, and there would be no guarantee of a bumper harvest next year. The cooperative management committee accepted this opinion and signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to purchase 300 pigs.

The Chunhe Cooperative adopted the practice of working during the day and airing views at night, achieving the goal of ensuring that rectification and production did not hinder each other. Due to the attention paid to rectification work, the political enthusiasm and work initiative of the cooperative members were further stimulated, and the cooperative cadres were able to better grasp the situation in all aspects, greatly promoting production. In recent times, the full cooperative's attendance rate has remained above 90%. In previous years, collecting old wall soil would not begin until after the Spring Festival, but now they have already collected more than 30,000 loads, and it is estimated that they will be able to collect 200,000 loads by the Spring Festival, which will complete 80% of the plan. The current amount of green manure accumulated is already 450,000 jin more than the total green manure amount of 1.05 million jin for the entire last year.

    农业社整改生产两不误
    云南两个社做得好：上蒜社两千多条意见开花结果春和社坚决改进工作干部群众一条心生产劲头大
    本报昆明25日电　云南晋宁县上蒜农业生产合作社认真地做到了整改生产两不误。
    上蒜农业社在大鸣大放大辩论后，迅速地转入整改阶段。社的领导方面整理了群众在鸣放中提出的一万九千多条意见。在这些意见中，属于农业社生产计划和经营管理方面的意见约占60％以上。各种意见可以分为四大类：（一）完全正确，并能立即改正的约占60％；（二）完全正确，但目前还不能解决的约占30％；（三）意见片面，需要认真解释的和完全错误的，约占10％。社里研究了进一步改进工作的方案，对群众提出的意见，凡是能改的就立即改，暂时不能改的就向群众作交代。社里召开了社员大会，乡政府、党总支、社管会、各个生产队的负责人员，都在会上向群众表示了整改的决心，并当场宣布了能够立即改的事项。例如，食品公司杀猪到乡下来杀，节省社员赶行的时间；划出了社员砍柴区，防止乱砍乱伐和没有柴烧的现象；医生定出巡回下乡制度；在社的生产计划方面，接受了社员提出的多改烟田和地改田的建议，计划明年扩大小秧田10％。同时，会上还处理了三个生产队长和一个信用社主任贪污盗窃的问题。对流氓懒汉，也按照社员的意见，给以强制劳动的管理，让他们用劳动工分按月来换取口粮。到目前为止，上蒜社已经根据群众的二千多条意见改进了工作，并且把一些完全错误的意见，拿到社员中去辨明是非。
    经过半个多月的整改，上蒜农业社又组织社员学习了农业发展纲要（修正草案），并且修订和制定了今后十年的农业发展远景规划和1958年的生产计划。在规划远景的时候，群众情绪极为高涨，普遍认为农业社各个方面都有了改进。社员群众展望未来的远景，建设山区的信心更大了。在整改中，全社85％以上的社员都提出了合理化建议，生产热情特别高涨。往年，秋收秋种后总有很多人闹着要歇一歇，而今年秋后就迅速地转入了冬季生产。全社二十五个生产队的劳动出勤率由80％左右提高到95％，劳动时间一般都保持在八小时以上。全社组织了兴修水利和积肥的两个大队，每天都有一千三百多人出动去修水利和挖草煤。地改田、改烟田积肥等增产措施都提前进行了。
    本报昆明25日电　云南玉溪县春和社大力整改，推动了生产。
    在整改阶段中，春和社的社干部和各生产队长对整改的重要性有比较明确的认识。他们认识到有缺点“不改就会和群众隔上一道墙，改了就能一条心”，“大家一条心，黄土变成金”。因此，他们每天都要分析社员的意见，能改的马上就改。到目前止，已经根据群众四百零六条意见改进了工作。
    在挑老墙土压田的工作中，开始时大家很积极，有六百多人出工。可是不几天，就只剩二百来人了。社员提出意见，原来是工分定得太低，路途远近没有差别，量土的尺子又不统一，有的强劳动力一天也只能挣五、六分。社管会研究了情况，依上工路途远近重定了定额，统一了尺子，使一般强劳动力每天能挣到十来分。这样一来，挑土的人一下子增至八百多人。
    社管会计划开荒三百亩，因地远土质差，社员积极性不高。社员说：那些地“种一葫芦收一捧，有啥种头”，“近处的荒地虽然零碎，但土肥，管起来也方便”。社管会接受了这一意见，修改了计划，各生产队也都积极起来了。
    过去对懒汉也照样分口粮，社员对此很有意见，认为应该把懒汉的口粮管起来，做了工才给他。社管会对这个问题作了研究，决定懒汉的口粮由社里保管，每月出二十个工给一月应得的口粮，出少了照扣。这样做，非但社员满意，懒汉也积极出工了。
    社里原来养了四百头猪，后来卖掉二百头，社干部嫌养猪要垫本钱，不准备多养。社员提出意见，用事实说明不养猪积不下肥料，明年大丰收就没有保证。社管会接受了这意见，和供销社订了购买三百头猪的合同。
    春和社采取白天劳动、晚上鸣放的做法，达到了整改生产两不误的目的。由于注意了整改工作，更激发了社员的政治热情和劳动积极性，社干部也能更好地掌握各方面的情况，大大地推动了生产。最近一段时间，全社出勤率一直保持在90％以上。在往年，挑老墙土要在春节后才开始，现在他们已挑了三万多挑，估计到春节能够挑到二十万挑，就可以完成计划的80％。目前所积的绿肥，已经比去年全年的绿肥数一百零五万斤超过了四十五万斤。
