Let Employees Speak Out Thoroughly and Concentrate Opinions on Key Issues: Special Topic Discussions in Shenyang and Harbin Factories Yield Great Results

    (Our Dispatch) Shenyang and Harbin, a number of factories which started the great blooming and contending earlier have begun special topic discussions. The experiences of many factories prove that special topic discussions are a more effective form of discussion to enable employees to express their opinions more fully.

    According to the experience of some factories in Shenyang and Harbin, special topic discussions involve enterprise leaders putting forward several topics under the following principles, and further mobilizing the employees to express their opinions around the topics in the form of big-character posters or discussion meetings. Their principles: one type of topic is needed to improve work; one type of topic is issues that the masses generally have opinions on; one type of topic is issues that were not discussed deeply or thoroughly in the previous stage of blooming and contending, and are summarized into several questions after research; another type of topic is issues that need to be resolved to further deepen the rectification movement.

    After many factories in Shenyang and Harbin adopted the form of special topic discussions, they not only further mobilized the masses, making the opinions of employees express more deeply, more widely, and more thoroughly, but also the movement developed more healthily. For example, after the Harbin Woolen Mill started the great blooming and contending at the end of September, although the employees' enthusiasm was very high, with 80% of the employees expressing their opinions, some people had not fully expressed their opinions, while some cadres and workers showed blind optimism, thinking that it was almost done. Big-character posters subsequently decreased, and fewer and fewer people spoke at discussion meetings. When the factory Party committee leaders briefly summarized the previous stage of blooming and contending, and then promptly guided the movement to special topic discussions, all the employees immediately set off a new upsurge of blooming and contending, and the number of speakers increased to more than 90%. After the employees of Shenyang No. 53 Factory engaged in general blooming and contending for a few days, they got "stuck," the number of big-character posters decreased day by day, and when holding discussion meetings, some people simply stated at the meeting: "My opinion has already been raised, and big-character posters have also been posted, there is nothing more to say." After the movement entered the stage of special topic discussions, the number of people expressing opinions quickly increased from about 70% in the previous stage to more than 90%.

    The greatest advantage of adopting the form of special topic discussions is that it can promptly guide the employees' concern from general issues within the factory to major key issues such as improving the enterprise, improving leadership style, as well as the country's political life, economic life, and various policies. This is more conducive to enterprise leaders solving various major problems within the factory during the rectification process. Because many employees have limited contact and a narrow range of issues they see and encounter due to their usual work relationships. Some people also touched on certain major issues in their speeches on big-character posters or at discussion meetings, but they were often very fragmented. Special topic discussions overcome this phenomenon. For example, in the previous stage of great blooming and contending at the Harbin Woolen Mill, the employees raised more than 3,300 opinions, of which 90% focused on general issues within the factory, or general welfare and the lifestyle of leaders, with very few belonging to the major issues that need to be resolved in the rectification. After entering the stage of special topic discussions, it was obviously different. In the first week of special topic discussions, more than 4,200 opinions were raised, of which more than half belonged to major issues of improving the enterprise, improving leadership style, and the country's political and economic life. In particular, opinions on improving enterprise management accounted for more than 49% of all opinions. Before the special topic discussions, the employees of No. 53 Factory had only more than 800 opinions on enterprise management; after entering the special topic discussions, the employees raised more than 4,000 opinions on improving enterprise management. Opinions related to the country's political and economic life also increased from more than 40 in the previous stage to more than 500.

    Before the special topic discussions, because there were no specific topics, the employees just spoke and expressed opinions on some problems they usually heard, saw, and thought about, regardless of what it was. Even if they wanted to make an in-depth consideration of a certain issue, they felt clueless and could only put forward some general opinions. For example, one big-character poster on the issue of streamlining institutions stated: "I think our factory has bloated institutions and should be streamlined." But it did not mention how to streamline it. After entering the stage of special topic discussions, because there were specific topics, the employees brainstormed around the topics and not only raised opinions on the bloated institutions and the need for streamlining, but also put forward specific suggestions on which aspects can be streamlined, and even how the work should be carried out after streamlining the institutions, which is more conducive to the leadership carrying out rectification.

    It should be noted that special topic discussions do not restrict the opinions of employees, nor do they prevent employees from raising issues outside the topic. Special topic discussions should also pay attention to the fact that the number of topics should not be too many. Too many topics will, on the one hand, affect the masses' in-depth consideration of issues, and on the other hand, it is impossible to solve many problems at the same time in the same period. If too many problems are raised and not solved, it will also affect the employees' enthusiasm for blooming and contending, and will not achieve the rectification requirements.

### 让职工鸣深放透把意见集中到关键性问题  沈阳哈尔滨工厂专题鸣放收效大

    让职工鸣深放透把意见集中到关键性问题
    沈阳哈尔滨工厂专题鸣放收效大
    本报讯　沈阳和哈尔滨两市，一些大鸣大放先行的工厂已开始专题鸣放。不少厂的事实都证明，专题鸣放是使职工群众更充分表达自己意见的一种更有效的鸣放形式。
    根据沈阳和哈尔滨一些工厂的经验，专题鸣放是企业领导人员在以下几个原则下，提出若干题目，进一步发动职工群众围绕着题目，用大字报或座谈会的形式，发表自己的意见。他们的原则：一类专题是改进工作所需要的；一类专题是群众普遍有意见的问题；一类专题是前一段鸣放得不深不透的问题，经过研究归纳成的若干问题；另一类专题是进一步深入开展整风运动所需要解决的问题。
    沈阳和哈尔滨两市许多工厂采用专题鸣放形式以后，不但进一步发动了群众，使职工群众的意见鸣放得更深、更广、更透，同时运动也发展得更加健康。例如哈尔滨毛织厂自从9月底开始大鸣大放以后，职工情绪虽然很高，占全厂人数的80％的人发表了意见，但有些人还没有把意见全部发表出来，而有些干部和工人则流露出盲目乐观情绪，认为差不多了。大字报随之减少，座谈会上发言的人越来越不踊跃。当工厂党委会领导人员简要地总结了前一段的鸣放情况，紧接着适时地把运动引向专题鸣放以后，全厂职工立即又掀起了新的鸣放高潮，发言的人数增加到90％以上。沈阳五三工厂的职工在对一般性的问题大鸣大放不几天以后，就“卡住”了，大字报数目日日下降，开座谈会的时候，有的人就干脆在会上表示：“我的意见已经提过了，大字报也贴过了，再没有什么可说的了”。当运动进入专题鸣放以后，发表意见的人数很快就由前一段的70％左右，增加到90％以上。
    采用专题鸣放形式最大的好处还在于它能及时地把职工群众只关心厂内一般性的问题引向到关心改进企业、改进领导作风以及国家政治生活、经济生活和各种政策等重大关键性的问题上去。这就更利于企业领导者在整改过程中解决厂内各种重大问题。因为许多职工群众限于平时工作关系，接触面不广，看到和接触到的问题一般都比较窄。有些人在大字报上或在座谈会上的发言中也涉及到了某些重大问题，但往往又很零碎。而专题鸣放就克服了这一现象。例如哈尔滨毛织厂在前一段大鸣大放中，职工群众提出了三千三百多条意见，其中有90％的意见，都是偏重厂内一般性的问题，或一般的生活福利、领导人员的生活作风问题，属于整风中着重要求要解决的重大问题则很少。进入专题鸣放以后，就显然不同，在进入专题鸣放第一个星期内提出来的四千二百多条意见，其中就有一半以上是属于改进企业、改进领导作风以及国家政治和经济生活方面的重大问题。尤其是改进企业管理方面的意见，竟达全部意见的49％以上。五三工厂在专题鸣放以前，职工群众对企业管理方面的意见只有八百多条；进入专题鸣放以后，职工群众提出有关改进企业管理方面的意见就增加到四千多条。属于国家政治、经济生活方面的意见也由前一段的四十多条，增加到五百多条了。
    在专题鸣放以前，由于没有题目，职工群众只就自己平时听到、见到和想到的一些问题，什么都鸣什么都放，即使对某一问题想作深入的考虑，也感到摸不着边际，也只能提出一些笼笼统统的意见。例如有的大字报对紧缩机构问题，提出：“我认为我们厂机构臃肿，应当精简”。但如何精简就没提出来。进入专题鸣放以后，由于有了题目，职工群众围绕着题目，集思广益，不仅提出了机构臃肿，应该紧缩的意见，同时还提出了从那些环节可以紧缩，甚至把紧缩机构以后的工作如何进行的意见，也都提得非常具体，这就更有利于领导上进行整改了。
    应该注意的是，专题鸣放，不是对职工群众的意见加以限制，不是不让职工越出题外提出问题。专题鸣放还应注意题目不宜过多，题目过多了一方面会影响群众深入地考虑问题，另一方面在同一个时期不可能同时解决很多问题，而问题提出多了，拖着不解决也同样会影响职工群众鸣放情绪，就会达不到整改要求。
