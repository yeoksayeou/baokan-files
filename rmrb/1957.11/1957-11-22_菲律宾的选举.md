The Philippines held its fourth general election since the war on November 12th. In addition to electing the president and vice president, eight vacant Senate seats and one hundred and two House seats were also up for election. The political parties participating in the election included the ruling Nationalist Party, as well as the opposition Liberal Party, the newly formed Progressive Party, and the Nationalist Citizens' Party. The results of the general election have now been announced: the incumbent Philippine President and Nationalist Party candidate, Garcia, was re-elected as president, and the Liberal Party candidate, Macapagal, was elected as vice president.

Although the results of this general election have created a new situation in the Philippines where the president and vice president belong to different parties, from the basic political platforms of the Nationalist Party and the Liberal Party, there is not much difference in essence between these two parties. Garcia and Macapagal have both publicly advocated pro-Americanism, anti-communism, and opposition to neutralism, which means continuing to implement the current policies of the Philippine ruling group. Therefore, the results of this general election will not have any practical impact on the Philippine political situation.

As everyone knows, the pro-American policy of the Philippine ruling group has long brought endless disasters to the Philippine people. Due to the signing of a series of unequal treaties with the United States, participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, acceptance of enslaving American aid, and adherence to the "embargo" policy, the Philippines' political, military, economic, and trade aspects are all under the control of the United States. As Philippine Senator Recto said, "In today's Philippines, it is the US Embassy that decides the Philippines' foreign policy arbitrarily, the US Military Advisory Group that decides military policy, and the US Foreign Aid Administration that decides economic policy." In this situation, Philippine sovereignty has been severely damaged, Philippine resources have been ruthlessly plundered, and the Philippine economic situation and people's lives are deteriorating. For many years, the Philippines has been suffering from trade deficits, foreign exchange depletion, inflation, and rising prices. There are often more than two million unemployed people, and the income of three million employed workers is not enough to maintain their lives. Even Philippine officials have had to admit that the lives of the Philippine people are lower than they were twenty years ago. Therefore, more and more Philippine people urgently demand to get rid of American control and change the current policy, because only in this way can they safeguard their national sovereignty and national interests. However, the voice of the Philippine people is suppressed, and the results of this general election cannot reflect their true wishes at all.

As in previous Philippine elections, this election was also conducted under the threat of bayonets from the pro-American group in the Philippines. First of all, out of the Philippines' 22 million population, only more than 7 million people have the right to vote. The candidates participating in the election are mostly representatives of comprador and feudal landlord classes who serve American monopoly capital. Philippine democratic groups and progressive trade unions are not allowed to participate in the election. The Communist Party of the Philippines, which fights for national independence and the vital interests of the people, was declared "illegal" even earlier. But even so, the Nationalist Party and the Liberal Party still felt unsure, and they used various means of fraud and terror to engage in election activities. The Philippine authorities dispatched more than 11,000 military police to "assist" the election. According to incomplete Philippine official statistics, as of November 2, there were approximately seventy bloody incidents in the Philippines due to the election, with eleven deaths and about forty injuries. In the Bangued area of ​​Abra province alone, six people were beaten to death in one day for participating in the election. In addition, according to the Liberal Party, the Nationalist Party also used illegal means such as comprehensive fraud, falsifying vote numbers, and buying votes in this election to achieve their goals. In one district of Iloilo alone, the number of votes was 40,000 more than the number of voters. What relationship do the president and vice president elected under these circumstances have with the voters? Even Liberal Party Chairman and House Representative Villareal said that this election was one of the bloodiest elections in the Philippines.

At the same time, the United States is not standing idly by. It openly interfered in the Philippine general election during the preparation stage. Officials from the White House, the State Department, and the Department of Defense have repeatedly expressed their hope that the current President Garcia will be elected as the next president. As for candidates with nationalistic sentiments, the United States disregarded usual international etiquette and abused them with attacks. For example, the Nationalist Citizens' Party's presidential candidate, Recto, was publicly distrusted and disliked by the American bourgeois press because he had criticized the United States' policy toward the Philippines. The Nationalist Party's vice-presidential candidate, Laurel, was branded by "Newsweek" as a "symbol of political corruption" in the Philippines because he had advocated re-examining US-Philippine relations. These situations once again confirmed a sentence in the secret documents lost by the US Embassy in Taipei: the United States must often "endeavor to give those (Asian countries) rulers the impression that their position is directly determined by their loyalty to the United States." And Washington officials do not feel ashamed of this despicable political blackmail, and when they see the Philippine rulers who are loyal to the United States elected, they are delighted and express "happiness."

However, the fate of the Philippines is not determined by this hypocritical and bloody election, nor is it determined by the arrangements of the US State Department, but will be determined by the Philippine people themselves. The entire Asia is advancing along the path of peace, independence, and progress, and the Philippine people will be no exception. In fact, in recent years, the voices representing the national interests of the Philippines have begun to appear, and they are also reflected to some extent in the speeches of some candidates in this general election. This is a new thing in Philippine political life, and although it does not seem strong now, it is unstoppable.

    菲律宾的选举
    陈汝厚
    11月12日，菲律宾举行了战后第四次大选。这次除了选举总统和副总统外，还要选举八名参议员的空缺和一百零二名众议员。参加竞选的政党，除了执政党国民党外，还有反对党自由党和今年新组织的进步党、民族主义公民党等。现在大选结果已经揭晓，现任菲律宾总统、国民党的候选人加西亚连任总统，自由党候选人麦卡帕格当选为副总统。
    这次大选的结果，虽然使菲律宾出现了总统和副总统分属不同政党的新局面；但是，从国民党和自由党的基本政纲来看，这两个政党在本质上没有多大差别。加西亚和麦卡帕格都公开主张亲美、反共和反对中立主义，也就是继续执行菲律宾统治集团的现行政策。因此，这次大选的结果，对菲律宾的政局不会有什么实际影响。
    大家知道，菲律宾统治集团的亲美政策，早就给菲律宾人民带来了无穷的灾难。由于同美国签订了一系列不平等条约，由于参加了东南亚条约组织，由于接受了奴役性的美援和追随“禁运”政策，菲律宾的政治、军事、经济、贸易各方面都处于美国的控制之下。正如菲律宾参议员雷克托所说，“在今天的菲律宾，“独断地决定菲律宾的外交政策的是美国大使馆，决定军事政策的是美国军事顾问团，而决定经济政策的是美国援外事务管理署”。在这种情况下，菲律宾的主权受到严重的损害，菲律宾的资源遭到无情的掠夺，菲律宾的经济状况和人民生活是越来越恶化了。许多年来，菲律宾一直处于贸易入超，外汇枯竭，通货膨胀，物价上涨的痛苦中。经常有二百万以上的人失业，有三百万的就业工人收入不够维持生活，甚至连菲律宾的官员也不得不承认，菲律宾人民的生活比二十年前还要低。因此，越来越多的菲律宾人民迫切要求的是摆脱美国的控制，改变现行政策，因为只有这样，才能维护自己的国家主权和民族利益。但是，菲律宾人民的声音是被压制的，这次大选的结果根本不可能反映他们的真正愿望。
    和菲律宾过去几次选举一样，这次选举也是在菲律宾亲美集团的刺刀威胁下进行的。首先，在菲律宾二千二百多万人口中，只有七百多万人有投票的权利。参加竞选的候选人，又大都是给美国垄断资本服务的买办和封建地主阶级的代表，菲律宾的民主团体和进步工会是不准参加竞选的。为民族独立和人民切身利益而奋斗的菲律宾共产党，更早被宣布为“非法”。但即使这样，国民党和自由党还感到没有把握，它们使用了种种欺诈和恐怖的手段来从事竞选活动。菲律宾当局出动了一万一千多名军警来“协助”竞选。据菲律宾官方不完全统计，到11月2日止，菲律宾由于竞选而发生的流血事件约有七十起，死十一人，伤四十人左右。仅务忽省棒峔地方，一天之内就有六人因参加竞选而被打死。此外，据自由党人说，国民党在这次选举中还采用了全面舞弊、伪造选票数字和收买选票等非法手段来达到他们的目的。仅在怡朗的一个地区，选票数字就比选民多了四万张。在这种情况下选举出来的总统和副总统，究竟同选民有什么关系呢？甚至连自由党主席、众议院议员维拉亚雷也说，这次选举是菲律宾最血腥的选举之一。
    同时，美国也并不是袖手旁观的。它还在菲律宾大选的准备阶段就公开加以干涉了。美国白宫、国务院和国防部的官员们，不断地表示他们希望现任总统加西亚当选下届总统。而对于有民族主义情绪的候选人，美国却不顾国际间通常礼仪，对他们滥施攻击。例如，民族主义公民党的总统候选人雷克托，因为他曾批评过美国对菲律宾的政策，美国资产阶级报刊便公开表示对他不信任和不喜欢。国民党的副总统候选人小劳雷尔，因为他曾主张重新审查美菲关系，美国“新闻周刊”竟骂他是菲律宾“政治腐败现象的象征”。这些情况又一次证实了台北美国大使馆遗失的秘密文件里的一句话：美国要经常“努力给那些（亚洲国家）执政者这样一个印象：他们的地位直接决定于他们对美国的忠诚”。而华盛顿官员们对于这种卑鄙的政治讹诈手法并不感到可耻，当他们看到对美国忠诚的菲律宾执政者当选以后，竟喜形于色地表示“高兴”。
    但是，菲律宾的命运并不决定于这种虚伪的血腥的选举，也不决定于美国国务院的摆布，它将决定于菲律宾人民自己。整个亚洲正在沿着和平、独立与进步的道路前进，菲律宾人民也不会例外。事实上，在最近几年中，代表菲律宾民族利益的呼声已经开始出现，它在这次大选中，在某些候选人的言论中也得到一部分的反映。这是菲律宾政治生活中的新生的事物，虽然现在看起来它还不是强大的，然而它却是不可阻挡的。
