Xinhua News Agency, November 21st, Moscow, November 20th (TASS): N.S. Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, stated that the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, at its meeting held in Stockholm at the end of October, passed a resolution on simultaneously launching a half-month campaign in various countries against nuclear weapons testing, calling on national peace committees to organize widespread popular demonstrations in November this year to demand an immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing. Soviet peace advocates warmly support this call from the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council.
    After discussion, the Presidium of the Soviet Peace Committee recently unanimously expressed its support for this call. The Presidium called on the Soviet public to actively participate in the half-month campaign to achieve an agreement among countries to cease nuclear weapons testing, to be held in November.
    Mass peace rallies for the prohibition and cessation of nuclear weapons testing will be held in Moscow, Leningrad, Riga, Tallinn, Minsk, Alma-Ata, Tbilisi, Tashkent, and many other cities in the Soviet Union. Representatives from all walks of life in the Soviet Union will hold a peace rally in Moscow on November 22. Mass rallies will be held in many large industrial enterprises. Clubs and cultural palaces will hold evenings dedicated to the peoples' struggle for the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing.
    Tikhonov said that news from various places shows that the call of the World Peace Council has received widespread response among all peace advocates in the Soviet Union. Soviet people are writing letters and sending telegrams to the United Nations, urging it to facilitate the rapid conclusion of an agreement among countries to cease nuclear weapons testing, believing that this should be the first step on the road to resolving the overall disarmament issue and easing international tensions. Soviet peace advocates will do everything possible to achieve this noble task, and they will actively promote the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues between countries and strive for an agreement on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 21st: K.B. Panikkar, Permanent Representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions to the United Nations, made a statement on behalf of the World Federation of Trade Unions at the plenary session of the Asian Regional Conference of the International Labor Organization on the morning of November 20, strongly urging the reduction of military spending, especially by some developed countries, to help the development of Asian countries.
    The statement called on technologically advanced countries to provide Asian countries with capital goods and technical knowledge, but this assistance should not undermine the sovereignty or development activities of the recipient countries. The statement cited Soviet assistance to China and India as examples, saying that only in this way "can Asia rapidly advance itself in terms of industrialization."
    The statement strongly demanded a fundamental change in social relations as a prerequisite for improving the situation of rural workers. The statement said, "This change essentially means that the cultivators who work directly on the land must be freed from the burden of having to share the fruits of their labor with the landlord class."
    The statement advocated taking concrete steps to improve the living conditions of the working people and that a strong trade union movement should be encouraged to develop appropriate labor-management relations.
    The statement emphasized that only the representatives of the People's Republic of China "can legitimately represent China." The statement expressed regret that the true representatives of China "have not been able to be here to present their experience to us."
    The statement said that "the concerted efforts of trade union organizations throughout Asia" are "extremely important" for the labor movement.
    A delegation from the World Federation of Trade Unions, headed by Danji, attended the meeting as observers.

    苏联人民保卫和平意志坚决
    各地群众将集会要求停止试验核武器
    世界工联建议各国削减军费帮助他国
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：苏联保卫和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫发表谈话说，世界和平理事会常务委员会10月底在斯德哥尔摩举行的会议，曾经通过了一项关于在各国同时开展为期半月的反对试验核武器的运动的决议，号召各国保卫和平委员会在今年11月组织广泛的人民示威游行，来要求立即停止核武器试验。苏联的和平拥护者热烈拥护世界和平理事会常委会的这一号召。
    苏联保卫和平委员会主席团最近经过讨论后，一致表示拥护这一号召。主席团号召苏联公众积极参加于11月举行的、为期半月的争取各国达成停止试验核武器协议的运动。
    莫斯科、列宁格勒、里加、塔林、明斯克、阿拉木图、第比利斯、塔什干和苏联的许多其他城市都将举行争取禁止和停止试验核武器的保卫和平群众大会。苏联各界代表将于11月22日在莫斯科举行保卫和平的集会。在许多大工业企业里将举行群众大会。俱乐部和文化宫将举行有关各国人民争取禁止试验核武器的晚会。
    吉洪诺夫说，来自各地的消息表明，世界和平理事会的号召在苏联全体和平拥护者中间获得了广泛的响应。苏联人纷纷写信和打电报给联合国，要求它促成各国尽速缔结一项停止试验核武器的协议，认为这应该是解决全部裁军问题、缓和国际紧张局势的道路上的第一步。苏联的和平拥护者将尽一切力量来实现这一崇高的任务，他们将积极地促进和平解决各国之间一切悬而未决的问题，争取达成关于禁止大规模毁灭性武器的协议。
    新华社新德里21日电　世界工会联合会常驻联合国代表克·布·潘尼迦20日上午在国际劳工组织亚洲区域会议的全体会议上，代表世界工会联合会发表声明，极力要求削减军费，特别是要求一些发达的国家削减军费，以帮助亚洲国家的发展。
    声明要求技术先进的国家向亚洲国家提供资本货物和技术知识，但是这种援助不应有损于受援国家的主权或发展活动。声明举出苏联对中国和印度的援助为例说，只有用这种方式，“亚洲才能使自己在工业化方面迅速前进”。
    声明强烈要求根本改变社会关系作为改善农村劳动者的情况的先决条件。声明说，“这种改变本质上就是说，直接在土地上劳动的耕作者必须摆脱那种把他的劳动成果分给地主阶级的负担。”
    声明主张采取具体步骤改善劳动人民的生活条件，应当鼓动强有力的工会运动以发展适当的劳资关系。
    声明强调说，只有中华人民共和国的代表“才能合法地代表中国”。声明对于中国的真正代表“没有能在这里向我们介绍他们的经验”表示遗憾。
    声明说，“全亚洲的工会组织的一致努力”对于劳工运动来说“是极为重要的”。
    以丹吉为首的世界工会联合会代表团作为观察员出席了会议。
