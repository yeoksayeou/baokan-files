Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, November 23rd:
The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Hefei Mining Institute, during the rectification phase, continuously criticized the "fearing difficulty," "being afraid of pain," and "quitting halfway" sentiments among leading cadres; determined to draw fire upon themselves, repeatedly mobilizing the masses to push the "speaking out freely and airing views fully" to a climax. In the past three weeks, the masses have posted more than 7,700 big-character posters, raising more than 18,000 opinions. These opinions sharply criticized the shortcomings in the school's leadership style, teaching, scientific research, and welfare work, and put forward many positive suggestions for improving work.
    At the end of October, when the rectification movement of Hefei Mining Institute entered the rectification phase, there were many ideological concerns among the school leaders, teachers, and staff. Some leaders did not fully recognize the significance of mobilizing the masses to speak out freely during the rectification phase and lacked confidence; some leaders lacked the determination to draw fire upon themselves; among teachers and staff, some were afraid of being labeled as rightists, some were afraid of being retaliated against for raising opinions, and some were afraid of hurting feelings. In light of these situations, the Party Committee of the institute first conducted ideological education for leaders at all levels, and then convened representative meetings of teachers, students, and staff to mobilize the masses at each level. Leaders at all levels expressed their determination and attitude in front of the masses. The president, vice-president, Party secretary, heads of departments, and teachers all went deep into the classes to carry out collective and individual mobilization. The secretary of the Communist Youth League also moved into the student dormitory and lived with the students, deeply mobilizing them. The administrative leaders of the institute also specifically arranged enough time for teachers, students, and staff to deliberate on speaking out, write big-character posters, and read big-character posters. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses for speaking out grew, and by November 14, more than 3,000 big-character posters had been posted, raising more than 6,000 opinions.
    The initial achievements of the first phase of speaking out caused some leaders to feel like they could take a break, thinking that speaking out was "almost done" and they could "sit down and rectify." At the same time, the "fearing difficulty" and "being afraid of pain" sentiments of some leading cadres were also more clearly exposed. Some leaders felt that it was better to stop at the right time because some of the masses' ideological concerns were still very serious; some leaders felt nervous and wavered when they saw that the masses had begun to sharply criticize the leadership. There were also some leaders who prematurely emphasized the need to shift to thematic speaking out, unwilling to further mobilize the masses. After studying the above situation, the Party Committee of the institute pointed out that the masses had not yet fully expressed their innermost thoughts, and the masses' criticism of the leadership was only just beginning; and promptly criticized the "fearing difficulty" and "being afraid of pain" thoughts of some leaders. On November 14, the institute held a council meeting to discuss how to further promote speaking out. The负责人 of the institute repeatedly called on leading cadres at all levels to break down all concerns, resolutely draw fire upon themselves, and take the lead in speaking out, so as to motivate the masses; and called on teachers, students, and staff to continue to use their brains, speak deeply and thoroughly, and promote the leadership to improve their work.
    After the 15th, the speaking out at this institute entered a new stage. Many elderly professors also posted big-character posters, raising sharp criticisms and appropriate suggestions on leadership style, teaching, and scientific research work. Party and League cadres also posted big-character posters criticizing the leadership style of the Party Committee. The students of the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering posted more than 1,200 big-character posters in one day, which was more than twice the number of big-character posters posted in the two weeks before the 14th. From the 15th to the morning of the 16th, the whole institute posted more than 4,000 big-character posters, raising more than 6,000 opinions.
    As the speaking out entered a climax, this institute resolutely improved its work, and many new atmospheres emerged. In recent days, more than 50 major issues have been rectified. In addition, many systems have also been improved. The president and Party secretary have further divided their responsibilities. They have now begun to improve their style, go deep into the grassroots, and increase direct contact with teachers and students in order to understand the situation and solve problems in a timely manner. The problem of excessive student burden, which the institute had been debating for several years without a good solution, has been more clearly understood and is beginning to be improved through this speaking out.
    Sun Zongrong, the president and first secretary of the Party Committee of the institute, told reporters that, judging from the situation where the speaking out at Hefei Mining Institute has initially entered a climax, the process of mobilizing the masses to speak out freely is a process of continuous struggle between some leaders and their own erroneous thoughts such as "fearing difficulty" and "being afraid of pain." The key to the depth and thoroughness of the speaking out lies in whether the leaders can overcome all concerns and be determined to draw fire upon themselves.

### 批判“畏难”“怕痛”思想　决心引火烧身  合肥矿业学院反复动员鸣放

    批判“畏难”“怕痛”思想　决心引火烧身
    合肥矿业学院反复动员鸣放
    新华社合肥23日电　中共合肥矿业学院委员会在整改阶段中，不断地批判领导干部中的“畏难”、“怕痛”和“中途歇劲”情绪；决心引火烧身，反复发动群众，把大鸣大放推向高潮。三周以来，群众已经贴出大字报七千七百多张，提出意见一万八千多条。这些意见尖锐地批评了学校领导作风、教学、科学研究和生活福利等工作中的缺点，并提出了很多改进工作的积极性的建议。
    10月底，合肥矿业学院的整风运动转入整改阶段时，学院领导人和师生员工中都存在着不少思想顾虑。有些领导人对在整改阶段发动群众鸣放的意义认识不足，信心不高；有些领导人缺乏引火烧身的决心；在师生员工中有些人怕戴右派帽子，有的人怕提了意见要被打击报复，有的人怕伤感情。该院党委会根据这些情况，首先对各级领导人进行思想教育，然后召开师生员工代表会议，层层发动群众。各级领导人都在群众面前表示了决心和态度。院长、副院长、党委书记、各系领导人和教师都深入到各个班级，进行集体动员和个别动员。共青团总支书记也搬到学生宿舍和学生同住，深入动员。院的行政领导并具体安排了足够时间，让师生员工酝酿鸣放、写大字报和看大字报。这样群众的鸣放劲头才大起来，到11月14日，就贴出了大字报三千多张，提出意见六千多条。
    第一阶段鸣放的初步成绩，使个别领导人产生了歇劲情绪，认为鸣放已“差不多”，可以“坐下来改”了。同时某些领导干部的“畏难”和“怕痛”情绪也更明显地暴露出来。有的领导人看到一部分群众思想顾虑还很严重，觉得不如适可而止；有的领导人看到群众已开始尖锐地批评领导，感到紧张、动摇。也还有些领导人过早地强调要转入专题鸣放，不愿再深入发动群众。院党委研究以上情况后指出，群众的内心话还远远没有说出来，群众对领导的批评也仅仅是开始；并及时地批判了某些领导的“畏难”、“怕痛”思想。11月14日学院举行院务委员会，讨论如何进一步推动鸣放，学院的负责人再三号召各级领导干部打破一切顾虑，坚决引火烧身，并带头鸣放，以带动群众；并号召师生员工继续开动脑筋，鸣深放透，推动领导改进工作。
    15日以后，这个学院鸣放进入新的阶段。许多老年教授也纷纷贴出大字报对领导作风、教学和科学研究工作提出了尖锐的批评和适当的建议，党团干部也对党委的领导作风贴出了大字报，机电系的学生，在一天的时间就贴出大字报一千二百多张，比14日前两周所贴的大字报还多两倍多。全院从15日到16日上午一天多时间内，共贴出四千多张，提出意见六千多条。
    随着鸣放进入高潮，这个学院狠狠地改进工作，出现了许多新气象。最近几天，仅重大问题就改了五十多件。另外还改进了很多制度。院长、党委书记进一步作了分工，他们现在已开始改进作风，深入下层，增加了同教师和学生的直接接触，以便及时了解情况，解决问题。学院争论几年一直未很好解决的学生负担过重问题，通过这次鸣放，已更清楚地弄清情况，开始改进。
    学院院长兼党委第一书记孙宗溶告诉记者说：从合肥矿业学院鸣放初步进入高潮的情况看来，发动群众鸣放的过程，就是和某些领导人同自己的“畏难”和“怕痛”等错误思想不断进行斗争的过程。鸣放的深和透的关键在于领导人是否能克服一切顾虑，决心引火烧身。
