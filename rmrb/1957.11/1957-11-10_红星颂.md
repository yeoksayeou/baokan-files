    Ode to the Red Star
    Forty years ago, on top of the Kremlin, a red star radiated light. It was the most beautiful hope in the hearts of the people, for which they had yearned for thousands of years. The Chinese people were overjoyed, like a ship at sea in the dark night identifying its direction. The red star emitted boundless radiance, shining into the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. The starlight became seeds, sprouting and growing in the hearts of hundreds of millions, with a red star growing in everyone's heart, growing into brilliant ideals. The people cherish the red star very much, regarding it as a panacea for bringing the dead back to life. The Communist Party gathered the sparks of stars, creating a flame of twenty-five thousand li, burning from Jinggang Mountain through snow-capped mountains and grasslands, all the way to Yan'an. The Communist Party condensed the red stars in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people into fiery red constellations, and adding the anger in the hearts of hundreds of millions, transformed it into an irrepressible volcano. Once the volcano erupted, it destroyed the old China, blasting out a socialist paradise. Thank you, Soviet people, thank you, Communist Party! Thanks to the red star of the Kremlin! Wonderful! The red star has radiated even further, sowing its brilliance in the hearts of people all over the world. Everyone's heart leads to Moscow, and everyone reverently pays tribute to the red star.

    红星颂
    汪静之四十年前在克里姆林宫顶，一颗红星辐射出光芒，它是人民渴望了千万年的人人心里最美丽的希望。中国人民惊喜若狂，像黑夜里的海船辨清了方向。红星放出万里光辉，照射到亿万人的心上。星光就成了种子，在亿万人的心头发芽成长，人人心里长出一颗红星，长出灿烂的理想。人民对红星十分宝贵，看作起死回生的仙丹。共产党聚集起星星之火，就造成二万五千里的火焰，从井岗山经过雪山草地，一直烧到延安。共产党把亿万人心头的红星凝结成火红的星团，再加上亿万人心头的怒火，化炼成怒不可压的火山。火山一爆发，轰毁了旧中国，轰出一座社会主义的乐园。感谢苏联人，感谢共产党！多亏克里姆林宫的红星！好哇！红星已经辐射得更远了，把光辉播种在全世界的人心。人人的心都通向莫斯科，都虔诚地向红星致敬。
