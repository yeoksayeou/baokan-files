Now, "running the school diligently and thriftily" has become the unanimous action of all the school's personnel. Recently, all faculty and staff of the Biology Department used holidays and spare time to organize a large number of instruments and specimens, making the laboratory brand new.

    北京师范大学在整改中，大力贯彻了勤俭办学的精神。现在，“勤俭办学”已成了全校人员的一致行动。生物系全体教职员最近利用假日和课余时间，整理了大批仪器和标本，使实验室焕然一新。他们在不到一个月的时间内，已经擦好二百二十多架显微镜。	　新华社记者　傅军摄
