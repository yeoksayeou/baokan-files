    The Just Cause Will Surely Triumph
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its debate on the West Irian issue on November 26th. The meeting passed a joint proposal put forward by Ceylon and eighteen other Asian-African countries and Bolivia in Latin America, requesting the Netherlands and Indonesia to re-enter negotiations on the West Irian issue. This proposal still needs to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion, but judging from the results of the debate in the Political Committee, Indonesia has already achieved an important victory.
    The United Nations debate on West Irian is essentially a struggle between colonialism and anti-colonialism. West Irian is an inseparable territory of Indonesia. Therefore, Indonesia's demand for the recovery of West Irian is a matter of course. However, for many years, the Netherlands has violated the Round Table Agreements it signed, violated its promise to transfer "full sovereignty" of Indonesia to the Republic of Indonesia, continued to occupy West Irian, continued to implement colonial rule there, and threatened the peace and security of the Republic of Indonesia. Therefore, as Indonesian representative to the United Nations, Dr. Soebandrio, said, the West Irian issue is "a straight forward case of colonialism." This point can also be proved from the debate and voting situation in the Political Committee: all socialist countries and the vast majority of Asian and African countries support Indonesia, while only Western colonial countries and their followers, such as Britain, France, Australia, Canada, Spain, etc., disregard all the facts and quibble for the Dutch colonists and vote against the joint proposal of Ceylon and nineteen other countries.
    However, the position of the Dutch colonialists and their supporters and the various "reasons" they have put forward are fundamentally untenable. The Dutch colonialists want to use racial viewpoints to prove that they seem to have the right to occupy West Irian. This is obviously absurd. Everyone knows that the residents of West Irian are part of the Indonesian nation. Since ancient times, they have lived together with residents of other parts of Indonesia and have close relations in language, culture, and customs. But on the other hand, as Ghanaian representative to the United Nations, Mr. Akko, pointed out: "What racial connection does West Irian have with the Netherlands?" The Dutch colonialists stubbornly link the West Irian issue with the so-called "right to self-determination," trying to split Indonesia and legalize its occupation of West Irian. But this trick has also been exposed. Many socialist and Asian-African representatives pointed out that West Irian is an integral part of Indonesia, and there is no question of any "right to self-determination." Moreover, the heroic struggle of the West Irian residents against the Dutch colonialists has long demonstrated their strong desire to return to the embrace of their motherland. Therefore, in the debate in the Political Committee, the Dutch colonialists and their supporters have suffered political and moral bankruptcy.
    It is worth noting the methods adopted by the United States in this debate. It abstained from voting on the proposal of Ceylon and nineteen other countries. Prior to this, on November 19, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also declared that the United States was taking a "neutral attitude" toward the West Irian issue. He believes that neither the Netherlands nor Indonesia has put forward "clear reasons." However, this "neutrality" is just a fragile disguise. The right and wrong of the West Irian issue are as clear as day and night, and there is no "neutrality" to speak of here. Moreover, in the situation where the Netherlands has already occupied West Irian, Dulles believes that Indonesia's demands for West Irian are without "reason." Isn't this openly supporting the Dutch colonialists? In fact, the American press has long revealed the United States' ambitions for West Irian and the United States' true position. Not long ago, an editorial in "The Washington Post and Times Herald" entitled "Let Us Support the Dutch"

    正义事业一定胜利	本报评论员
    联合国大会政治委员会于11月26日结束了关于西伊里安问题的辩论。会议通过了锡兰等十八个亚非国家和拉丁美洲的玻利维亚所提出的联合提案，要求荷兰和印度尼西亚就西伊里安问题重新举行谈判。这个提案还需要提交联合国大会全体会议讨论，但是就政治委员会的辩论结果来说，印度尼西亚已经取得一次重要胜利。
    联合国关于西伊里安的辩论，实质上是一场殖民主义和反殖民主义的斗争。西伊里安是印度尼西亚的不可分割的领土。因此，印度尼西亚要求收复西伊里安，是天经地义的事情。但是，多年以来，荷兰竟违背它所签订的圆桌协定，违背它所宣布的把印度尼西亚的“全部主权”移交给印度尼西亚共和国的诺言，一直霸占着西伊里安，继续在那里实行殖民统治，并威胁印度尼西亚共和国的和平与安全。因此，正如印度尼西亚驻联合国代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约所说，西伊里安问题是“一个不折不扣的殖民主义问题”。这一点，从政治委员会的辩论和投票情况中也可以得到证明：一切社会主义国家和绝大部分亚非国家都是支持印度尼西亚的，而只有西方殖民国家及其追随者，像英国、法国、澳大利亚、加拿大、西班牙等，才不顾一切事实替荷兰殖民者进行狡辩，并投票反对锡兰等十九国的联合提案。
    但是，荷兰殖民者及其支持者的立场和它们所提出的种种“理由”，是根本站不住脚的。荷兰殖民者想用种族观点来证明它似乎有权霸占西伊里安。这显然是荒谬绝伦的。谁都知道，西伊里安的居民是印度尼西亚民族的一部分，自古以来，他们就同印度尼西亚其他地方的居民生活在一起，并在语言、文化和习俗上有着密切关系。可是另一方面，正同加纳驻联合国代表阿克霍斯特所指出的：“西伊里安同荷兰有什么种族联系？”荷兰殖民者硬把西伊里安问题同所谓“自决权”问题扯在一起，想要分裂印度尼西亚，并把它对西伊里安的占领合法化。但这种诡计也被揭穿了。许多社会主义国家和亚非国家代表指出，西伊里安同印度尼西亚是一体的，根本谈不到什么“自决权”问题。而且，西伊里安居民反抗荷兰殖民者的英勇斗争，早就说明了他们要求回到祖国怀抱的强烈愿望。因此，在政治委员会的辩论中，荷兰殖民者及其支持者已经遭到政治上和道义上的破产。
    值得注意的是美国在这次辩论中所采取的手法。它对锡兰等十九国提案投了弃权票。在这以前，11月19日，美国国务卿杜勒斯也宣称，美国对西伊里安问题是采取“中立的态度”。他认为，荷兰和印度尼西亚双方谁都没有提出“明确的理由”。但是，这种“中立”不过是一触即破的伪装而已。西伊里安问题的是非像白天和黑夜一样分明，这里根本没有什么“中立”可言。而且，在荷兰已经霸占着西伊里安的情况下，杜勒斯却认为印度尼西亚对西伊里安的要求是没有“理由”的，这不是公开支持荷兰殖民者，又是什么呢？事实上美国报刊早就透露了美国对西伊里安的野心和美国的真正立场。不久以前“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”发表的一篇题为“让我们支持荷兰人”的社论，就是一例。
    由于荷兰霸占西伊里安的行为，严重地侵犯了印度尼西亚的领土主权，由于荷兰和美国正在利用西伊里安这个基地来威胁印度尼西亚以及整个东南亚地区的和平，联合国完全有责任采取有效措施，使这个问题得到合理解决。
    印度尼西亚人民正在全国展开如火如荼的要求收复西伊里安的爱国主义运动，它有力地表现了印度尼西亚人民争取祖国统一和维护独立自由的最大决心。中国人民是完全同情印度尼西亚人民的。我们将继续同其他社会主义国家和亚非国家一起，坚决支持印度尼西亚人民要求收复西伊里安的斗争。我们相信，印度尼西亚的一切爱国力量将更加紧密地团结起来，正义的事业一定会得到胜利。
