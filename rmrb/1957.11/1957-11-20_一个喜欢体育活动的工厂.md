	A Factory That Loves Sports Activities
	The workers of the Tianjin Wool Processing Factory are particularly fond of sports activities because exercise has driven away illness and improved their attendance rate.
	Before liberation, the working conditions in this factory were very poor, and many people suffered from occupational diseases – lung disease. Countless people were dismissed by the factory due to illness and embarked on the road of unemployment.
	After liberation, the Party and administrative leaders of the factory were very concerned about the health of the workers. Not only did they increase protective equipment in the workshops and improve working conditions, but they also vigorously carried out sports activities to enhance physical fitness and eliminate diseases.
	Since 1951, the entire factory has organized morning exercises. Now, those who regularly participate in the exercises account for 80% of the total number of employees. In 1953, the factory was rated as an outstanding unit in Tianjin for carrying out morning exercises.
	The workers personally experienced the benefits of exercise, and more and more people participated in sports, and the sports programs became more abundant. They successively organized more than 20 teams such as long-distance running teams, basketball teams, football teams, wrestling teams, and track and field teams. The number of people who regularly participate in exercise has increased from dozens to more than 300. Leading cadres also actively participate in sports. Of the 56 Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League cadres in the factory, 40 regularly participate in activities; of the 11 members of the Party general branch, 10 participate in activities.
	Regular physical exercise has improved the workers' sports skills, and they have further requested to organize various competitions. Since 1953, the factory has held a comprehensive sports meeting every autumn; on weekends, holidays, and spare time, friendly matches are often organized within the factory or with brother factories. In addition, military competitions and camping were held in the summer, and medium and long-distance running and skating competitions were held in the winter. Single events such as weightlifting, long jump, cross-country, running, and cycling were held in spring and autumn. In the year and a half from January 1956 to July this year, the factory's basketball team played more than 150 external games, and the factory's football team played more than 20 external games. More than 5,700 employees participated in various competition activities.
	In the 1956 Tianjin Ten Major Factories Sports Competition and the Tianjin Commercial System Second Workers' Games, the factory won the first place in the team total score.
	As a result of carrying out sports activities, the health level of the workers has been significantly improved. In 1956, the attendance rate of all employees in the factory was over 95%, exceeding the level of general factories. The attendance rate of 88 factory-level sports team members reached 99.44%, of which 37 were rated as advanced producers, accounting for 22% of the total number of advanced producers in the factory.

    一个喜欢体育活动的工厂
    天津绒毛加工厂的职工们，特别喜欢体育活动，因为运动给他（她）们驱除了病魔，提高了出勤率。
    解放前，这个工厂的劳动条件非常坏，许多人得了职业病——肺病。因为有病而被厂方解雇，走上了失业的道路的，不知有多少人。
    解放后，厂的党、政领导，很关心工人的健康，不但在车间增加了防护设备，改善了劳动条件，而且大力开展体育活动，借以增强体质、消除疾病。
    从1951年起，全厂有组织地开展了广播体操，现在经常做操的，占全厂职工总人数的80％。1953年该厂曾被评为天津市开展广播体操优秀单位。
    职工们亲身体验到运动的好处，参加运动的人愈来愈多，运动的项目也更加丰富。他们先后组织了长跑队、篮球队、足球队、摔跤队和田径队等二十多项。经常参加锻炼的人数，由几十人增加到三百多人。领导干部也积极参加运动，全厂党、政、工、团干部共五十六人，有四十人经常参加活动；党总支十一人，有十人参加活动。
    经常的体育锻炼，提高了工人的运动技术，他们进一步要求组织各种竞赛。从1953年以来，每年秋季该厂都举行一次综合性运动会；在周末、假日及平时的业余时间，经常在厂内或约兄弟厂组织友谊比赛。此外，在夏季还举行过军事比赛和野营，冬季举行过中、长距离跑和滑冰比赛，春秋两季举办过举重、跳远、越野、赛跑、自行车等单项比赛。从1956年1月到今年7月的一年半的时间内，厂篮球代表队对外比赛一百五十多场，厂足球代表队对外比赛二十多场。参加各种竞赛活动的职工有五千七百多人次。
    在1956年天津市十大工厂体育运动对抗赛和天津市商业系统第二届工人运动大会的比赛中，该厂都获得了团体总分第一名。
    开展体育运动的结果，工人们的健康水平显著提高了。1956年全厂职工的出勤率是95％强，超过一般工厂水平。八十八名厂级各项运动代表队队员的出勤率达到99．44％，其中有三十七人被评为先进生产者，占全厂先进生产者人数的22％。　（施）
