On October 30th, a "Mi-6" helicopter piloted by Soviet pilots Karpelyan and Alferov successfully set a world helicopter flight record during a test flight at an airport near Moscow. The aircraft carried 12,004 kilograms of cargo, took off at 12:31, and climbed to an altitude of 2,400 meters in just over ten minutes, far exceeding the world record of 6 tons and 10 kilograms of cargo and an altitude of 2,000 meters set by U.S. Air Force Major Anchesson on November 10th of last year.

    苏联直升飞机又创世界纪录
    载重十二吨多上升到二千四百公尺高空
    本报莫斯科31日电　苏联航空工业部试验工厂总设计师米里设计制成了新型“米—六”螺旋桨双引擎直升飞机。10月30日，一架“米—六”直升飞机由苏联飞行员卡尔佩利扬和阿尔费罗夫驾驶，在莫斯科近郊机场试飞中，成功地创造了直升飞机飞行的世界纪录。这架飞机载运了十二吨零四公斤的货物，在十二时三十一分离开地面，十多分钟之后就上升到二千四百公尺的高空，这远远超过了去年11月10日美国空军少校安奇逊所创造的载重六吨十公斤、飞行高度二千公尺的世界纪录。
    这种新型直升飞机将广泛应用货物运输。它适应于转运重型物资、建筑材料、拖拉机等，并可用于勘探工作。这种直升飞机可乘七十到八十个乘客。（附图片）
