Only by Fully Relying on the Masses Can Work Be Thoroughly Improved
	Solving Problems Alone is Slow and Ineffective
	Mobilizing the Masses is Fast and Efficient
	Important Experience Gained in the Rectification of Harbin's Industrial and Mining Enterprises

(Our Newspaper, Harbin, 10th Dispatch) An important experience has been discovered in the rectification movement of Harbin's industrial and mining enterprises: only by fully mobilizing the masses can the rectification work of enterprises be carried out well.

The workers of Harbin's two hundred and eighteen enterprises, through airing their views, put forward more than 1.2 million opinions. For each enterprise, there were almost thousands or tens of thousands of opinions. Some of these opinions had been accumulated for a long time without being resolved, while others involved a wider scope. This brought certain difficulties to the enterprise rectification work. However, as long as we believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, and fully mobilize and organize the workers to use their brains, speak out, take action, and participate in the rectification work in the field, many difficulties can be solved easily. In the past, the Songjiang Knitting Factory always hired people to repair the boiler, costing more than 300 yuan each time. After the workers suggested solving the problem themselves in this airing of views, the leadership was still full of worries, fearing it would affect production and cause accidents. But after in-depth research with the workers in the workshop recently, they found that not only could they repair it themselves, but it would not affect production and could also ensure safety. In the rectification work of the Songha Machinery Factory, thanks to the full mobilization of the masses, they solved the problem of heating equipment for employees that had been shelved for five years with less than 70% of the planned investment. Deputy Factory Director Wang said with emotion: "I really didn't expect that the old problem that couldn't be solved in the past few years would be solved so quickly when handed over to the masses." The Harbin Rubber Factory, relying on the broad masses of workers to find solutions to problems, has basically resolved all 1,250 opinions put forward by the workers, except for major problems that cannot be resolved temporarily. In the past, when the Harbin Woolen Mill only relied on the rectification work team to handle problems, it only handled 22 cases in five days; later, when it was handed over to various units to mobilize the masses to solve problems, it solved 36 cases in one day.

Using worker representative meetings to discuss and handle major issues within the enterprise is an important method for mobilizing the masses to participate in rectification work. The Songjiang Electric Motor Manufacturing Factory recently held consecutive worker representative meetings at the factory and workshop levels, concentrating the wisdom of the masses to discuss the work improvement plans formulated by various departments, and some problems were quickly resolved. For example, the workers of the Sixth Workshop proposed that the workshop management was chaotic, drawings and materials were not issued in a unified manner, and the dispatch station often lost parts and drawings. The workshop director thought it would not be easy to solve in a short time. Later, after discussion at the worker representative meeting, it was decided to merge the material clerk and the dispatcher, and the materials and drawings would be issued at the same time, and the problem was solved, and it also saved manpower. Some problems, after explanation, made the masses feel satisfied. For example, many foundry workers, blacksmiths, and welders in this factory requested to wear crystal stone glasses and were unwilling to wear industrial colored glasses. At this worker representative meeting, Li Linsen, the head of the technical safety section, compared crystal stone glasses and industrial colored glasses, explaining the characteristics and functions of colored glasses, and the workers suddenly understood. Li Wensheng, a representative of the welding section, said: "We used to think that the leaders were unilaterally emphasizing frugality. Since colored glasses are both suitable and economical, what else can we say?" At the factory-wide worker representative meeting, using the method of everyone discussing and finding solutions, 81 measures for improving work and production were adopted.

Many enterprises attach importance to giving play to the role of veteran workers in the rectification work. Since the Songjiang Hardware Factory shifted to external processing in 1952, the tasks have become more complicated and scattered, coupled with the phenomenon of "the planner issues the work ticket, the material clerk doesn't know," so workers often stopped work waiting for materials. In this airing of views, veteran worker Pan Zuobin was the first to raise this issue. The Party branch and the rectification work team immediately convened veteran workers such as Pan Zuobin for discussions to study the causes and solutions to this problem. Finally, it was determined that in the future, when doing each batch of work, the process engineer should first create drawings and estimate the man-hours, and hand them over to the planner, then the planner would write the work ticket and hand it over to the material clerk for material preparation, and finally the delivery clerk would transfer the work ticket, drawings, and materials to the worker together. This unified distribution method not only prevented workers from running around randomly, but also completely solved the problem of work stoppages waiting for materials that had not been solved for five years. As a result, this workshop completed the monthly plan thirteen days ahead of schedule in October, creating an unprecedented production record for this workshop.

Many enterprises, due to taking various measures to earnestly mobilize the masses to participate in the rectification work, not only accelerated the rectification speed, but also further encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for airing their views and their production enthusiasm. In the First Engineering Office of the Northeast Third Engineering Company, 72% of the opinions raised by workers were handled in a timely manner, and as a result, workers raised more than 5,000 more opinions within a few days. The rebar team of the First Engineering Office of the Northeast Third Engineering Company originally planned to complete the binding of small foundation rebar in three days. Seeing that the leaders attached importance to their opinions and earnestly improved their work, they became more active and completed the task in two days. Zhang Huilu's team at the Songha Machinery Factory, seeing that the leaders went to the team to solicit opinions, said with emotion: "The leaders are so determined to improve their work, we have to work hard too!" As a result, they completed the October production plan ahead of schedule on October 19. The workers of the Harbin Wire Factory, seeing that the factory had more potential for increasing production and practicing economy after the rectification work, revised this year's plan for increasing production and practicing economy after mass discussions, determining to increase production and save 3 million yuan of wealth for the country on the basis of the original plan.

### 单枪匹马解决问题又慢又少  发动群众解决问题又快又好  哈尔滨工矿企业整改中取得重要经验

    只有充分依靠群众才能彻底改进工作
    单枪匹马解决问题又慢又少
    发动群众解决问题又快又好
    哈尔滨工矿企业整改中取得重要经验
    本报哈尔滨10日电　在哈尔滨工矿企业的整风运动中，摸索出一条重要经验：只有充分发动群众，才能搞好企业的整改工作。
    哈尔滨二百一十八个企业的职工，通过鸣放提出了一百二十万多条意见。就每个企业来说，差不多都有数千条和上万条的意见。这些意见，有的是过去长期积压没有解决的，有的牵扯面较广。这给企业整改工作带来一定的困难。但是，只要相信群众的智慧和力量，充分发动和组织职工动脑、动口、动手，实地参加整改工作，许多困难都可以迎刃而解。松江针织厂过去锅炉检修都是请人花钱修理，每修一次就需要三百多元，在这次鸣放中工人提出应该自己动手解决后，领导上还是顾虑重重，怕影响生产，怕出事故。但最近深入车间和工人研究后，不仅自己可以修理，而且不影响生产，还能保证安全。松哈机械厂在整改工作中，由于充分发动群众，仅用了不到投资计划的70％，就把搁置五年的职工取暖设备问题解决了。王副厂长感动地说：“真没有想到，这几年没能解决的老问题，一交给群众就这样快地解决了。”哈尔滨橡胶厂，依靠广大职工群众想办法解决问题，全厂职工提出的一千二百五十条意见，除了暂时不能解决的重大问题外，基本上都已得到解决。哈尔滨毛纺厂过去只依靠整改工作组处理问题的时候，五天内只处理了二十二件；后来交给各单位发动群众解决问题时，一天内就解决了三十六件。
    通过职工代表会议来讨论和处理企业内的重大问题，是发动群众参加整改工作的重要方法。松江电机制造厂最近连续召开厂和车间的职工代表会议，集中群众的智慧，来讨论各部门所制定的改进工作方案，有些问题很快得到了解决。譬如六车间的职工提出车间管理混乱，图纸、材料下达不统一，调度站经常丢失零件、图纸等问题，车间主任认为一时不易解决。后来经过职工代表会议讨论确定：把材料员和调度员合并在一起，材料、图纸同时下达，问题就解决了，而且还节省了一个人力。有些问题，经过解释，群众感到满意。比如这个厂许多翻砂工、锻工和电焊工人要求戴水晶石眼镜，不乐意戴工业有色眼镜。这次在职工代表会上，由技术安全科长李林森将水晶石眼镜和工业有色眼镜作了比较，说明有色眼镜的特点、作用，职工们才恍然大悟。电焊工段代表李文生说：“我们以前以为是领导片面强调节约了，既然是有色眼镜既适用，又节约，我们还有啥意见呢？”在全厂职工代表会上，用大家讨论想办法的方法，通过了八十一项改进工作、生产的措施。
    许多企业在整改工作中，都重视发挥老工人的作用。松江五金厂从1952年转入外加工以来，任务就比较复杂、零散，再加上存在着“计划员下工票，材料员不知道”的现象，因而工人就经常停工待料。在这次大鸣大放中，首先由老工人潘作斌提出这个意见，党支部和整改工作组立刻召集潘作斌等老工人座谈，研究产生这一个问题的原因和解决办法，最后确定：今后作每批活时，要先由工艺员制出图纸和估好工时一齐交给计划员，再由计划员写出工票交材料员备料，最后由送料员将工票、图纸和材料一起转给工人，这样统一下达的方法，不仅工人不再乱跑了，而且还彻底解决了五年来一直没有解决的停工待料问题。因而，这个车间在10月份提前十三天完成了月计划，创造了这个车间空前未有的生产纪录。
    许多企业由于采取多方面的措施，认真发动群众参加整改工作，不仅使整改速度加快，而且进一步鼓舞了职工的鸣放热情和生产积极性。东北第三工程公司第一工程处，由于职工提出的意见72％得到了及时处理，结果几天内职工又提出了五千多条意见。东北第三工程公司第一工程处的钢筋队，绑扎小型基础钢筋时，原计划三天完成，他们看到领导重视他们的意见，并认真改进工作，便更加积极起来，结果两天就完成了任务。松哈机械厂张卉禄小组，看到了领导深入小组征求意见，感动地说：“领导这样决心改进工作，咱们也得使劲干哪！”于是，10月份的生产计划，他们在10月19日就提前完成了。哈尔滨电线厂的职工们，在看到厂里经过整改工作之后，有着更多的增产节约潜力，经过群众讨论，修订了今年的增产节约计划，确定在原计划的基础上，再为国家增产节约三百万元的财富。
