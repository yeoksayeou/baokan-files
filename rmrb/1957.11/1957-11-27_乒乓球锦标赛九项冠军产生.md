Nine champions of the 1957 National Table Tennis Championships in men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles, mixed doubles, youth competition, and consolation matches were determined on the evening of the 26th after more than 1,200 matches over the past four days. Wang Chuanyao and Ye Peiqiong won the men's and women's singles championships, respectively. Wang Chuanyao and Hu Bingquan, and Deng Zhujun and Li Linshu won the men's and women's doubles championships, respectively. Zhuang Zedong and Zhang Baodi won the mixed doubles championship.

In the five championship matches held on the evening of the 26th, Wang Chuanyao and Jiang Yongning competed for the men's singles championship. Wang Chuanyao played very steadily and flexibly in this match. He used patient lifting and spinning shots to receive the ball returned by Jiang Yongning, then powerfully smashed with a big swing. Several powerful smashes forced Jiang Yongning to run more than ten feet away from the table to save the ball, then Wang suddenly dropped a short shot, and when Jiang Yongning rushed forward to rescue the short ball, he smashed it to death with a powerful stroke. Jiang Yongning lost three games in a row and finished as runner-up, allowing Wang Chuanyao to win this year's national men's singles championship.

The women's singles championship was contested by Ye Peiqiong and Qiu Zhonghui, with Ye Peiqiong using steady chopping to defeat Qiu Zhonghui three to one.

The men's doubles championship was contested by Wang Chuanyao and Hu Bingquan against the young players Yang Ruihua and Xu Yinsheng from Shanghai Team One. All four were attacking players, with Wang and Hu excelling in powerful smashes, while Yang and Xu were known for their agility and speed. From the start of the match, the audience was dazzled by the抽 (chōu, to draw out, to pump), 挡 (dǎng, to block), 推 (tuī, to push), and 削 (xiāo, to pare, to peel) techniques of both sides. In the end, Wang Chuanyao and Hu Bingquan defeated Yang Ruihua and Xu Yinsheng three to one to win the championship.

Zhuang Zedong and Zhang Baodi of Beijing Team Two won the mixed doubles championship, defeating their last opponents, Yang Ruihua and Zhu Peimin of Shanghai Team One, three to two.
