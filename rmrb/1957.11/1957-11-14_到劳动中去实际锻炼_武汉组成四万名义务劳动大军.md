Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 12th: A volunteer labor force of more than 40,000 people, composed of cadres from Hubei Province and Wuhan City, officers and soldiers of the stationed troops, and students from universities and colleges, will go to the Dongxihu Comprehensive Farm Reclamation Area in the suburbs of Wuhan in four batches over the next four months to participate in soil carrying and dike construction. The first batch of over a thousand volunteer laborers, carrying their luggage, set off on foot today for this reclamation area, dozens of miles away from the city, to begin a labor life of about thirty days.

The Dongxihu Farm, covering an area of more than 450 square kilometers, is the first and largest comprehensive farm serving the city in our country. This reclamation area must complete more than 15.5 million cubic meters of dike construction earthwork by the end of March next year, before the flood season arrives, to ensure the smooth progress of land reclamation and construction. The Party and government leaders here, in order to train cadres, decided to organize volunteer labor to complete 800,000 cubic meters of the earthwork task. Each person participating in this voluntary labor must complete an average of 1.17 cubic meters of earthwork per day, which is equivalent to a person carrying 50 catties of soil and walking 50 li. Volunteer laborers, like migrant workers, live in sheds made of reed mats.

In the past few days, after mobilization and discussion through various meetings, the atmosphere of demanding to go to labor to train oneself in organs and troops has been very strong. People compare this centralized voluntary labor to a "short-term cadre labor training class," and are vying to sign up and strive to be the first batch to test themselves. Many organs, except for the elderly, the weak, and pregnant women, have almost all signed up. Xia Kui, Lieutenant Colonel and Director of the Wuhan Military Service Bureau, and more than a dozen officers immediately signed up after hearing the news, and repeatedly called the voluntary labor command organization to approve them to go in the first batch. Many cadres have submitted letters of determination or guarantee to the Party and Youth League branches or administrative leaders of their organs.

Before the departure of the volunteer labor force, Wang Haishan, Deputy Governor of Hubei Province, Wei Tinghuai, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan, and the bureau chiefs, section chiefs, and factory directors who serve as the brigade commanders and squadron leaders of the voluntary labor organization, had already gone to the wild reclamation area to inspect the terrain, check tools, and prepare food and lodging.

    到劳动中去实际锻炼
    武汉组成四万名义务劳动大军
    新华社武汉12日电　由湖北省和武汉市四万多名机关干部、驻军官兵和大专学校学生组成的义务劳动大军，今后的四个多月里将分四批到武汉市郊区东西湖综合农场围垦区去参加挑土修堤。第一批里的上千名义务劳动者今天已经背着行李，徒步出发到这个远离市区数十里的垦区，开始了为期三十天左右的劳动生活。
    占地四百五十多平方公里的东西湖农场，是我国第一个最大的为城市服务的综合性农场。这个垦区必须要在明年3月底，即汛期到来之前，完成一千五百多万立方公尺的修堤土方工程，以保证垦荒、建场工程的顺利进行。这里党和政府领导上为锻炼干部，决定其中八十万立方公尺的土方任务组织义务劳动来完成。每个参加这一义务劳动的人，平均每天要完成一点一七立方的土方，这等于一个人挑五十斤土走五十华里的路程。义务劳动者和民工一样，住在用芦席搭设的工棚里。
    几天来，经过各种会议的动员和讨论、酝酿，机关、部队里要求到劳动中去锻炼自己的空气十分浓厚。人们把这次集中的义务劳动比喻为“干部短期劳动训练班”，争先恐后地报名争取第一批去考验自己。不少机关除老弱、孕妇外，几乎全体都报了名。武汉市兵役局局长夏夔中校和十多名军官听到消息后马上报名，并多次打电话要求义务劳动指挥机构批准他们第一批去。不少干部向机关党、团支部或行政领导上提出了决心书或保证书。
    义务劳动大军出发之前，湖北省副省长王海山、武汉市副市长魏廷槐和担任义务劳动组织的大队长、中队长的局长、科长、厂长们，已经先一步前往荒野的围垦区察看地形、检点工具和准备食宿去了。（附图片）
