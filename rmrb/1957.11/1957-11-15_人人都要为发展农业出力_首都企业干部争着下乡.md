Everyone Should Contribute to Developing Agriculture
Cadres from Capital Enterprises Eagerly Go to the Countryside

(Our Newspaper, reporter Yu Yaofu) A surge of going to the countryside and participating in labor has been stirred up among management personnel in factories and mines in Beijing. As of November 12, according to statistics from thirty-five state-owned factories, mines, and municipal postal and telecommunications enterprises, more than 2,570 cadres have already gone to the countryside to participate in production.

In recent days, when you go to factories and mines in Beijing, you can see that many big-character posters from the period of extensive airing of views have been covered by colorful application forms and letters of determination. After the Beijing Railway Administration held a mobilization meeting on October 18, 576 people posted 569 big-character posters that afternoon, requesting to go to the countryside to become new farmers. The number of applicants accounted for 99.2% of the total number of employees in the bureau. Qiu Huifang, a Party member from the Finance Department of the bureau, said: "I was born into a bourgeois family and have always lived in the city. I don't know the five grains, and I can't even tell the difference between white flour and rice flour. How can I understand the feelings of the working people? I must go down to temper myself." Engineering and technical personnel from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory have expressed that they want to go to the countryside to personally participate in agricultural labor, help farmers repair and use new agricultural tools, and conduct on-the-spot research and design of agricultural tools suitable for the specific conditions of the Chinese countryside. The actions of many cadres in applying to participate in rural labor have received enthusiastic support from their families. Exemplary cases of couples encouraging each other and parents mobilizing their sons have emerged one after another. Zhou Ji, a technician from the Capital Construction Section of a certain machinery factory, initially had some concerns about going to the countryside. He discussed it with his father at home. His father (a professor at the Institute of Technology and a municipal People's Representative) said: "People are going, why aren't you going? You were raised by a nanny since you were a child. What do you know? Quickly sign up to go to the countryside to reform yourself!" So Zhou Ji immediately signed up.

There were many moving scenes when various enterprises bid farewell to the personnel going to the countryside to participate in labor. At the farewell meeting of the Automobile Accessories Factory, Hu Mingcai, a cadre from the Health Section, said on behalf of the cadres going to the countryside: "We want to be new farmers, and we want to compete with the comrades staying in the factory on different fronts and work hard to produce." Li Jun, an old worker from the stamping workshop, happily went to the podium and said: "In the past, some of us workers thought that cadres mostly sit in the office, wave pens, and can't labor. Your actions this time have greatly moved us. We guarantee to unite all employees to complete the production tasks." At the farewell meeting, the No. 2 State Cotton Factory launched a competition of "winning the red flag for working in the countryside and winning the red flag for production in the factory." All the personnel going to the countryside happily left the factory amidst the sound of gongs and drums.

The cadres going to the countryside have been warmly welcomed by the farmers. Each agricultural cooperative has arranged housing and meals for these new farmers in advance, and actively helped them master agricultural production techniques. Streets and squares in the countryside are plastered with slogans welcoming the transfer of cadres. When cadres were transferred to many rural areas, firecrackers were set off and gongs and drums were played, welcoming them like a festival.

The personnel transferred to the countryside are generally enthusiastic, humble in learning, and actively laboring, adding a new force to agricultural production. In addition to participating in agricultural labor, many transferred personnel also help the commune settle accounts, study and improve labor organization, organize reading newspapers, and carry out recreational activities. The transfer of cadres has also changed the wrong ideas of some agricultural cooperative members. Some educated youth in the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative were originally not content with agricultural production and requested to transfer to cities and factories. Now that they see many cadres coming to the countryside, they are beginning to settle down. Many people say: Cadres who have been cadres for so many years have come to participate in agricultural production, why should we change our profession? Let's work honestly!

With a large number of cadres participating in production in the countryside, many factories and mines in Beijing have seen a new atmosphere of lean organization and high efficiency. In the rectification campaign, employees of Beijing state-owned enterprises put forward 850,000 opinions, of which opinions on the large size of enterprise organizations accounted for a significant proportion. Now, according to statistics from sixty-one state-owned and municipal enterprises, management personnel can be reduced by 45%, and service personnel can be reduced by 21%, totaling 37% of non-production personnel.

    人人都要为发展农业出力
    首都企业干部争着下乡
    本报讯　记者余药夫报道：在北京厂矿企业的管理人员当中，一个到农村中去、到劳动中去的热潮掀起来了。截至11月12日为止，据三十五个国营厂矿和市政邮电企业的统计，二千五百七十多名干部已经到农村参加了生产。
    最近一些日子，当你到北京厂矿企业中去的时候，在每个企业里都可以看到，许多大鸣大放时的大字报，都被五颜六色的申请书和决心书所掩盖了。北京铁路管理局10月18日开过动员大会以后，当天下午就有五百七十六人贴出五百六十九张大字报，要求到农村去当新的农民，报名人数占全局实有人数99．2％。这个局财务处的党员丘惠芳说：“我出身资产阶级家庭，一直住在城市，五谷不分，连白面大米面都分不清，这怎么体会劳动人民的感情呢？我一定下去锻炼。”北京农业机械厂工程技术人员纷纷表示，要到农村去亲自参加农业劳动，帮助农民修理和使用新式农具，并且实地研究和设计适合中国农村具体情况的农具。许多干部报名参加农村劳动的行动得到了家属的热情支持。夫妇互相鼓励，父母动员儿子的模范事例层出不穷。某机械厂基建科技术员周济，开始对到农村去还有些顾虑，回家同父亲商量，他父亲（工业学院教授、市人民代表）说：“人家去，你为什么不去？你从小让奶妈子抱大，懂得什么？赶快报名到农村去改造改造吧！”于是周济立即报了名。
    各企业在欢送到农村参加劳动的人员时，有许多动人的场面。在汽车附件厂的欢送会上，卫生科干部胡明才代表到农村去的干部说：“我们要当新农民，我们要同留厂的同志在不同的战线上展开竞赛，努力生产。”冲压车间老工人李钧高兴地到讲台上去说：“过去我们工人中有的认为干部多是坐办公室，摇笔杆，不能劳动。这次你们的行动使我们受到很大感动。我们保证团结全体职工完成生产任务。”国棉二厂在欢送会上发起了“到农村劳动得红旗，在工厂生产得红旗”的竞赛。所有到农村去的人员都在锣鼓喧天声中欢天喜地地离开了工厂。
    到农村去的干部受到农民热烈欢迎。各个农业合作社事先都为这些新农民安排了房屋、伙食，并且积极帮助他们掌握农业生产技术。农村中街头和广场都贴满了欢迎干部下放的标语。许多农村当下放干部到来时，鞭炮连响，锣鼓齐鸣，像过节日一样地欢迎他们。
    下放到农村的人员，一般都热情饱满，虚心学习，积极劳动，为农业生产增加了一支新生力量。许多下放人员在参加农业劳动以外，还帮助社里结算账目，研究改进劳动组织，组织读报，开展文娱活动。干部的下放也改变了某些农业社员的错误思想。东方红农业合作社有一部分知识青年原来不安心农业生产，要求转到城市和工厂，现在看到许多干部来到农村便开始安下心来。许多人说：多少年的干部都来参加农业生产了，咱们转什么业，老老实实地干吧！
    随着大批干部到农村参加生产，北京许多厂矿企业出现了机构精干、效率较高的新气象。北京国营企业职工在整风中提出了八十五万条意见，其中对企业机构庞大的意见占不小的比重。现在，据六十一个国营和市政企业的统计，管理人员可减少45％，服务人员可减少21％，两项合计占非生产人员的37％。
