    The Shijiazhuang Silk String Opera Troupe is meeting Beijing audiences with its rich and excellent repertoire. Judging from the performances of the past few days, it has already won the praise and unanimous acclaim of Beijing audiences.
    Silk String Opera is a relatively ancient opera form popular in Hebei Province. It is divided into four branches: Central Route, North-East Route, South Route, and West Route; active in the vast towns and villages of central, southern, and western Hebei Province. The Shijiazhuang Silk String Opera Troupe now performing in Beijing is the Central Route, one of the larger branches.
    Silk String Opera is a type of opera most loved by the vast number of farmers in Hebei Province. Whenever it is the New Year, a festival, or after the busy farming season, farmers invite Silk String Opera troupes to perform for them. They not only like to watch and listen, but they can also sing themselves. It is said that many villages have amateur troupes, and they all have costume boxes and stages. During festivals, farmers open their costume boxes and go on stage to perform. It can be seen how deep the friendship between them and the working people is. It has become an indispensable necessity in the cultural life of the masses! It is said that, because Silk String Opera has a broad base of working people and a close relationship with them, it once aroused the extreme hatred of the feudal rulers, who used the method of "taxing" Silk String Opera performances to implement a disguised ban on performances and singing!
    Before liberation, Silk String Opera troupes, like other opera forms, suffered the cruel persecution and destruction of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Many old artists died or changed professions, causing great losses to Silk String Opera. It was not until after liberation, under the care of the Party and the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," that this withered famous flower was restored and greatly developed.
    When I went to Hebei Province for inspection last year, I came into contact with this opera form, which has a long history and a broad mass base, for the first time. At that time, almost all the simple farmers with white cloths wrapped around their heads were watching the opera with me. When I appreciated this opera art, which was created by and loved by the masses of farmers, I could not help but be deeply attracted by its strong atmosphere of life and its simple and healthy tone. At the same time, I was very surprised that a troupe that has been performing in rural areas and small towns for a long time could have such good performances, skills, and rich music. It can be said that, from that time on, I liked it very much.
    I still remember that I watched Mr. He Fengxiang's "Holding an Umbrella" that time. He has very good singing skills, and his performance is very beautiful and reasonable in terms of gestures and movements. It is clear at a glance that he is a very accomplished actor. In particular, his footwork and dance after holding an umbrella and walking in the rain are different from the footwork and dance of many opera forms, vividly showing the posture of walking on a rainy ground. His performance is very rare.
    In "The Empty Seal Box," the old actor Zhang Yongjia, who plays the old family member Zhou Neng, is an actor who is good at both singing and acting. His voice is broad and loud, and can be described as "solid and loud." Wang Yongchun, the young male actor who plays the judge He Wenxiu, and Li Tieshan, the actor who plays the painted-face Sun Long, both have good skills and movements, and their gestures are also very good.
    A common characteristic can be seen from these actors: their performances are real, pure, and not excessive. This characteristic is also prominent in the young actress Yuan Xueping, who plays the Little Sister in "Little Sister's Dream." Yuan Xueping is a promising young actress. In this play, she shows different six or seven roles when she expresses how an unmarried girl imagines the happiness of her future life. Her movements are quite skilled and not flashy. If she can continue to work hard, she has a promising future.
    Silk String Opera not only has many excellent repertoires, but also extremely rich music. There are a total of 500 tunes (it is said that 200 have been sorted out so far, and the rest that have been lost must be found from old artists in the countryside. I think this is a very important task and needs to be carried out quickly); many of them, such as "Mountain Slope Sheep," "Oriole," "Dwelling Clouds Flying," "Dwelling Horses Listening," and "Drunken Flower Shadow" are the same as the tunes of Kunqu Opera, which shows that the relationship between Silk String Opera and Kunqu Opera is very close. In addition, the relationship between Silk String Opera and Old Tune Bangzi is also very deep. Silk String Opera and Old Tune Bangzi once had a history of performing on the same stage. When it was still the "Long Shunhe Silk String Opera Society," the predecessor of the Shijiazhuang Silk String Opera Troupe, the founder of the society, Mr. Liu Kuixian, invited masters of Kunqu Opera, Shanxi Bangzi, Peking Opera, etc. to teach the art, so whether in performance or music, Silk String Opera has accepted the influence of Kunqu Opera, Old Tune Bangzi, Peking Opera, etc., making it richer on its original foundation and becoming an opera form with a rich and profound tradition!
    Silk String Opera attaches great importance to singing. The actors' singing can be done in a correct and round tone, and their pronunciation is accurate. Silk String Opera's singing uses a mixture of large and small voices. Generally, the large voice is used at the beginning, and the small voice is used at the end of the sentence for a sixth or seventh degree interval. Silk String Opera calls this small voice "second tone." This mixture of Ming tone (large voice) and second tone and the large jump of six or seven degrees increases the difficulty of singing, but if the upper and lower tones are connected very naturally and uniformly, it will produce a very high-pitched and beautiful effect. When I watched it last year, I also felt that many actors' voices were connected relatively stiffly, so it sounded a bit sudden at first. Now, after their efforts and reforms over the past year, there has been great progress in this regard. This improvement should be affirmed. I think more effort can be put into this aspect in the future to make the connection even better.
    In addition, the reform carried out in the orchestra is also worth mentioning here. In the past, the instruments of Silk String Opera were mainly the pipa and the sanxian. Later, influenced by Bangzi, instruments such as the banhu were added, which made the sound richer than before. However, when I listened to the opera last year, I still felt that the volume of the civil instruments was too thin and seemed a bit weak. This time, when they came to Beijing to perform, they not only used the banhu, sanxian, erhu, horizontal flute, and sheng, but also added the zhonghu, cello, and violin, which made its volume much richer and also increased the changes in timbre. In terms of the military instruments, the original big gong and big cymbals were also appropriately restored. For example, in the "Study Room Plan" scene in "The Empty Seal Box," the use of the big gong and big cymbals was restored. This use is appropriate, so it is also very effective.
    In the old society, although "Silk String Opera" was loved by the vast number of farmers, it did not receive the attention it deserved. It has been living and dying in the countryside, so the Silk String Opera troupe has never performed in Beijing and larger cities, and audiences in large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin are also very unfamiliar with this old opera form. This time, the Shijiazhuang Silk String Opera Troupe can perform in Beijing, which is not only a major event for the Silk String Opera form, but also a matter of great joy for the capital's audience. Thank you for bringing us such a rich and excellent repertoire, and let us wish them great success in this performance!

    冀中民间戏剧的花朵——丝弦戏
    程砚秋
    石家庄市丝弦剧团以它丰富优秀的剧目和北京的观众见面了。从这几天演出的情况来看，它已经得到了北京观众的赞扬和一致的好评。
    丝弦戏是流传在河北省民间的一个较为古老的剧种。它又分四个支派即中路、北东路、南路及西路；活动于河北省的中部、南部及西部的广大的城镇和农村。现在来北京公演的石家庄市丝弦剧团是其中较大的支派之一的中路。
    丝弦是河北省广大农民最喜爱的一种戏曲。农民们每当过年过节，或农忙过去以后，就要邀请丝弦剧团为他们演出。他们不仅喜欢看、喜欢听，而且自己会唱；据说很多村子里都有业余的剧团，他们自己都有衣箱，还有戏台，逢年过节时，农民们就打开衣箱自己上台唱戏。可见它和劳动人民之间的情谊多么深厚，它已经成为群众文化生活中一件不可缺少的必需品了！据说，由于丝弦戏拥有的广大的劳动群众基础以及它和他们之间的密切的关系，曾经引起封建统治者的极端的憎恨，他们以上演丝弦要“纳税”的办法来实行过变相的禁演、禁唱！
    解放前，丝弦剧团也和其它剧种一样，一直遭受到日寇及国民党反动派的残酷的迫害和摧残，很多老艺人死的死了，转业的转业了，给丝弦戏带来极大的损失。直到解放后，在党的关怀及“百花齐放”的方针下，这朵雕零了的名花，才又恢复起来，并得到了大力的发展。
    当我去年到河北省视察时，我才第一次接触了这个有着悠久历史并有着广泛的群众基础的剧种。当时在我周围和我一道看戏的几乎都是在头上包着白布的纯朴的农民兄弟。我欣赏着这个为农民群众所创造并为他们所热爱的戏曲艺术时，不禁深深地被它所具有的强烈的生活气息，纯朴而健康的情调所吸引；同时更对这样一个长期在农村和小城镇中演出的剧团能有这样好的表演、功底和丰富的音乐感到非常惊讶，可以说，从这时起，我就非常喜欢它。
    还记得那一次我看了何凤翔老先生的“扯伞”。他有着很好的唱工，在做派上、身段上都表演得非常优美和入情入理，一看就知道是一个很有造诣的演员。特别是他撑伞后在雨中行走的步法、舞蹈与很多剧种的步法和舞蹈都不同，维妙维肖地表现了在雨地里行走的姿态。他的表演是非常难得的。
    在“空印盒”中，饰老家人周能的老生演员张永甲是一个唱做俱佳的演员，他的声音宽而洪亮，可以称得起是“实大声洪”了。饰按院大人何文秀的小生演员王永春、饰花脸孙龙的演员李铁山，他们都有很好的功架和身段，做派也非常好。
    从这些演员身上可以看出来一个共同的特点：表演真实、纯质而不过火。这一个特点在“小二姐做梦”中，饰小二姐的青年演员袁雪屏身上，也是突出的。袁雪屏是一个有希望的青年演员，她在这出戏中，表现一个未出嫁的姑娘怎样幻想着未来生活的幸福时，表现了不同的六、七个角色，动作都相当熟练而不浮夸，如果她能继续不断的努力，是很有发展前途的。
    丝弦不仅有很多优秀的剧目，而且音乐也极其丰富，共有曲牌五百个（据说现在整理了的已有二百支，其余已经失散的，还必须到农村中找老艺人挖掘，我觉得这是一个很重要的工作，需要很快地进行）；其中有很多如“山坡羊”、“黄莺儿”、“驻云飞”、“驻马听”、“醉花阴”等曲牌都与昆曲的曲牌相同，可见丝弦和昆曲的关系是非常密切的；此外丝弦和老调梆子的关系也非常深，丝弦和老调就曾经有过一段同台合作演出的历史：还在石家庄市丝弦剧团的前身“隆顺合丝弦剧社”时，这个社的创办人刘魁显先生就曾经请过昆曲、山西梆子、京剧等的师傅教过艺，所以无论在表演上或音乐上，丝弦都接受了昆曲、老调梆子，京戏等的影响，使它在原有的基础上，更加丰富起来，成为一个有着丰富、深厚传统的剧种！
    丝弦对唱工是很重视的，演员们的演唱都能做到字正腔圆，咬字真切。丝弦的演唱是大、小嗓混合运用，一般开始用大嗓，到句尾就以小嗓作六度或七度音的跳进，丝弦称这种小嗓为“二音”。这种明音（大嗓）与二音的参和使用和六、七度音的大跳，增加了演唱上的困难，但如果上下音衔接非常自然、统一，就会产生非常高亢和优美的效果。我去年观摩时还感到有很多演员的声音，衔接得比较生硬，因此乍听起来有些突然。现在经过他们一年多来的努力和改革，在这一点上就有了很大的进步。这个改进是应该肯定的。我觉得今后还可以在这方面多下些功夫，使它连接得更好。
    此外，在乐队上进行的改革也值得在此一提。以前丝弦的乐器，主要是琵琶和三弦，以后受了梆子的影响，增加了板胡等乐器，使音响较前丰富了些；但我去年听戏时，仍感到文场的乐器，音量太单薄，显得有些贫弱；这一次他们来京演出，不仅用了板胡、三弦、二胡、横笛和笙，而且还增加了中胡、大提琴、小提琴；这就使它的音量丰富了很多，同时音色的变化也增加了。在武场方面也适当地恢复了原有的大锣大钹，如“空印盒”中“书房定计”一场，就恢复了大锣大钹的使用，这个使用是恰当的，因此也很有效果。
    在旧社会，“丝弦”虽然被广大的农民所热爱，但却没有受到应有的重视，它一直在农村里自生自灭，所以丝弦剧团也从未到北京及较大的城市演出过，而北京、天津等大城市的观众对这个老剧种也非常生疏；这一次石家庄丝弦剧团能到北京上演，就不仅是丝弦剧种的一件大事，而且也是首都观众极感高兴的事。感谢他们给我们带来这样丰富优秀的剧目，让我们预祝他们在这次演出中得到很大的成功！
