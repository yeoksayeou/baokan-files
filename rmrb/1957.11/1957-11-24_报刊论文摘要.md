The Philosophical Significance of Artificial Satellite Launch

From a philosophical perspective, the new scientific era opened up by the successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite, along with its brilliant scientific prospects and abundant achievements, will undoubtedly enrich and develop Marxist philosophy, more powerfully promote the immortal vitality of dialectical materialism, and inspire more dialectical philosophical thought for the advanced civilization era of communism. The successful launch of the artificial satellite itself embodies the glorious victory of the correct application of Marxist natural dialectics. It is estimated that the infinite exploration of cosmic science will also greatly enrich and develop Marxist natural dialectics. The manufacturing, launching, and operation of artificial satellites prove the excellent examples of the philosophical concepts of "motion is the existence of contradiction itself" and "freedom is the recognition of necessity." Conversely, the development of natural science is inseparable from dialectical materialism. Today's scientific researchers need to thoroughly grasp dialectical materialism. The victory of this new scientific era embodies the victory of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, which is even more obvious. Why was the Soviet Union the first to launch an artificial satellite? Why did the United States declare failure in this peaceful competition? Why has Soviet science and technology jumped to the forefront of the world? Why has the reputation of American science, industry, and technology been hit? Why does the socialist system itself and its scientific research have unparalleled vitality? Has the American monopoly capitalist system already seriously hindered the development of science and technology? Aren't these the best vivid illustrations of dialectical materialism and historical materialism? From the perspective of historical materialism: The successful launch of the artificial satellite not only marks a new era in cosmic science, but also marks the era of human cosmic development.

Soviet Scientific Achievements Are the Accomplishments of the Party's Leadership and the Socialist System

Over the past forty years, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have done a great deal to promote science and consolidate the material foundation of science. In terms of guidelines and policies, the Party and the government have established the principle of "overall development, focusing on the use of forces" for the development of scientific undertakings. By adopting this principle, on the one hand, the various departments of science can achieve balanced development, and on the other hand, the main forces can be concentrated to make key breakthroughs in the most important scientific departments, so that those scientific issues that are most important to national defense and economic construction, as well as the scientific issues that have the most profound impact on the development of the entire natural science, can be given priority to be resolved. In order to specifically implement this principle in practice, the Party and government leaders organized scientists to complete arduous scientific organizational work, such as formulating scientific plans, clarifying the growth points of science, determining fundamental scientific problems, systematically studying solutions, carefully selecting and correctly assigning executors, organizing effective liaison systems and information exchange, establishing necessary connections between different scientific departments; strengthening scientific coordination work, so that the Academy of Sciences, industrial sector research institutions, and universities can achieve a rational division of labor and close cooperation, paying attention to avoiding duplication and waste, and also paying attention to cultivating different schools of thought and developing academic debates; as well as the training and allocation of scientific cadres, the utilization and promotion of scientific achievements, etc. These measures have enabled tens of thousands of Soviet scientists to form a unified and powerful collective united by a common will. This collective has provided unprecedented power for the research and invention of individual scientists, greatly promoting the speed of scientific development and the application of scientific achievements in practice. All of this is difficult to imagine without the leadership of the Party and the socialist system.

    报刊论文摘要
    人造地球卫星发射的哲学意义
    从哲学意义上看，苏联人造地球卫星成功所开辟的科学新纪元及其今后辉煌的科学远景与丰富成果，也将毫无疑问地丰富与发展马克思主义哲学，更其雄伟有力地发扬辩证唯物主义不朽的生命力，并可昂扬为共产主义高级文明时代更加辩证的哲学思想。人造地球卫星成功发射，这一事实本身就体现了马克思主义自然辩证法正确运用的光辉胜利，估计宇宙科学无限开拓也必然要大大丰富发展马克思主义的自然辩证法。人造地球卫星的制造、放射和运行，这一事实证明了哲学上的“运动就是存在着的矛盾本身”和“认识了必然的自由”的良好实例。反过来看，自然科学的发展，完全离不开辩证唯物主义，现在的科学研究工作者更需要彻头彻尾地把握辩证唯物主义。这次科学新纪元的胜利，体现辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义思想的胜利，就更为明显。为什么苏联能第一个放射人造卫星？美国在这一和平竞赛中宣告失败？为什么苏联科学技术跃居世界首位？美国科学、工业、技术的名声受到打击？为什么社会主义制度本身及其科学研究有无比旺盛的生命力？美国垄断资本主义制度业已相当严重地障碍了科学技术的发展？这些不就是辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义最好的生动说明吗？从历史唯物主义来说：人造卫星成功发射，不但标志着宇宙科学的新纪元，而且也标志着人类宇宙发展史的纪元。（摘自1957年“新建设”第十一期上官清：“人造卫星辉煌发射的政治意义与哲学意义”）
    苏联科学成果是党的领导和社会主义制度的成就
    四十年来，苏联共产党和苏联政府为繁荣科学和巩固科学的物质基础做了许多工作。在方针政策方面，党和政府为发展科学事业规定了“全面发展、重点使用力量”的方针。采取这个方针，一方面，可以使科学的各个部门得到均衡的发展，另一方面，又可以集中主要力量，重点突破最重要的科学部门，使那些对于国防和经济建设最重要的科学问题，以及对整个自然科学发展影响最深远的科学问题，得到优先解决。为了在实践中具体贯彻这个方针，党和政府领导与组织科学家完成了繁重的科学组织工作，如制订科学规划，明确科学的生长点，确定根本性的科学问题，系统地研究解决的办法，慎重地选择和正确地分配执行者，组织有效的联络系统和情报交换，建立不同科学部门之间的必要的联系；加强科学协调工作，使科学院、产业部门研究机构和高等学校得到合理的分工和紧密的配合，既注意避免重复浪费，又注意培养不同学派，发展学术争论；以及科学干部的培养和分配，科学成果的利用和推广等。这些措施使成千成万的苏联科学家形成了一个统一的、由共同意志团结起来的强大的集体，这个集体为个别科学家的研究和发明提供了史无前例的力量，大大地促进了科学发展的速度及科学成果在实践中的应用。这一切离开了党的领导和社会主义制度是难以设想的。
