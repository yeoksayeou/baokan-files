    Soviet Union Develops Intercontinental Jet Passenger Plane
    Direct Flights Possible from Moscow to Beijing, Tokyo, or New York
    (Reported by our Moscow correspondent on the 3rd) On the eve of the October Revolution anniversary, the Soviet Union manufactured the "Tu-114" intercontinental passenger plane. Aboard this aircraft, one can fly non-stop from Moscow to Beijing, Vladivostok, Tokyo, Rangoon, New York, and other distant destinations. This is the world's largest high-speed, long-range jet passenger aircraft. This new aircraft is a collective gift from the Soviet designers, led by chief designer Tupolev, to the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. The new aircraft is equipped with four turboprop engines and has three cabins that can accommodate 170 people. In addition, there are four rooms that can accommodate three people lying down or six people sitting. For intercontinental long-distance flights, the number of passengers can be reduced to 120; for short-distance flights, the number of passengers can be increased to 220. The new aircraft is two-tiered, with the upper level for passengers and the lower level for cargo, capable of carrying a train car's worth of luggage and goods. The new aircraft will fly at high altitudes, but the air pressure, humidity, and temperature inside the cabin will remain constant, so that passengers will not feel overly fatigued during continuous non-stop flights of ten to twelve hours. The new aircraft solves an important task: greatly reducing the cost of air transport. Due to its large carrying capacity, long range, and high speed, the price of airplane tickets will be as cheap as train tickets in the future.

    苏联制成洲际喷气旅客机
    从莫斯科可直飞北京、东京或纽约
    本报莫斯科3日电　在十月革命节前夕，苏联制成了“图—114”洲际旅客机。乘这种飞机可以不着陆地从莫斯科飞到北京、海参崴、东京、仰光、纽约和其他远方。这是世界最大的高速远程喷气旅客机。这是在总设计师图波列夫领导下的苏联设计师们集体给十月革命四十周年的献礼。这个新型飞机配备四部透平螺旋桨，内有三个舱，能容一百七十人，此外还有四个房间，能卧三人或者坐六人。在作洲际远程飞行时，乘客可以减到一百二十人；在作短程飞行时，乘客可以增加到二百二十人。新型飞机制两层，上层载人，下层载货，可载车皮行李货物。新型飞机将在高空飞行，但机内气压、湿度、温度保持不变，使乘客在连续十到十二小时不着陆飞行时不会感到过分疲倦。新型飞机解决了一个重要任务：大大降低空运成本。由于运输力大，飞得远，飞得快，飞机票的价格将来可以和火车票一样便宜。
