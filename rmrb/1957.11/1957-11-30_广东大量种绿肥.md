Guangdong Massively Plants Green Manure

    (Our dispatch) Guangdong province's green manure planting area this winter will reach six million mu, more than double last year's, which can solve the fertilizer needs of approximately ten million mu of paddy fields for next spring's plowing. Currently, over 1.4 million mu have been successively planted.
    Guangdong province's large-scale promotion of green manure planting only began this year. In the past, many areas were unwilling to plant more because cadres and the masses lacked awareness of the benefits of planting green manure, emphasizing that they were not accustomed to it. This year, after great debates, presenting facts, calculating benefits, and criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, cadres and the masses have initially gained a correct understanding, and therefore the planting area has significantly increased.
    While planting green manure in the winter, the mass movement for accumulating fertilizer is also vigorously unfolding throughout the province. Farmers throughout the province have accumulated more than 430 million dan of farm manure, an average of 21 dan of fertilizer per mu of winter crops. Efforts are being made to over fulfill the target of accumulating 5.7 billion dan of fertilizer next year.

    广东大量种绿肥
    本报讯　广东省今冬绿肥种植面积将要达到六百万亩，比去年扩大两倍以上，大约可以解决明年春耕一千万亩稻田的用肥需要。目前，各地陆续种下了一百四十多万亩。
    广东省大量推广种植绿肥是今年才开始的，过去有不少地区因为干部和群众对种植绿肥的好处缺乏认识，强调没有习惯，不愿意多种。今年经过大辩论、摆事实、算收益和批判右倾保守思想后，干部和群众初步有了正确的认识，因而种植面积有了显著增加。
    在冬种绿肥的同时，全省群众性的积肥运动也正在蓬勃地展开，全省农民所积得的农家肥已达四亿三千多万担，平均每亩冬种作物有肥二十一担，正力争超额完成明年积肥五十七亿担的指标。
