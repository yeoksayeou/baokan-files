    Learning from the Experience of Soviet Agricultural Collectivization
    --Commemorating the Fortieth Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution
    Chen Zhengren
    The path opened up by the great October Revolution is the only path for the proletariat around the world to liberate themselves. If the proletariat wants to liberate themselves and make revolution, they must find allies. The Soviet experience has proven that the laboring peasants are the most solid allies of the proletariat in carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction. Only by forming an alliance with the broad masses of laboring peasants can the proletariat achieve victory; and only under the leadership of the proletariat can the broad masses of laboring peasants be freed from the exploitation of landlords and the bourgeoisie, in order to achieve complete liberation.
    The Soviet Union was the first country in the world led by the proletariat to implement land system reform. The second decree promulgated by the Soviet regime was the "Land Decree" confiscating the land of the landlord class. The Soviet Union was the first country to achieve agricultural collectivization and a high degree of mechanization. The Soviet Union's experience in solving the worker-peasant alliance problem in different historical periods, in its basic points, has universal significance for the revolution and construction of all countries in the world.
    The Chinese revolution is a continuation of the October Socialist Revolution, and we have always attached great importance to the valuable experience of the Soviet Union. In the matter of realizing agricultural collectivization, that is, carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture, we also take the Soviet Union as an example. As early as 1943, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "On the side of the peasant masses, for thousands of years they have been individual economy, with each household as a production unit. This kind of scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and causes the peasants themselves to fall into permanent poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only road to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." In our cooperative movement, in order to gradually change the lifestyle of the peasants, and in order to enable the peasants to gain practical experience and ensure increased agricultural production, we experienced a stage of semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives before turning to fully socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives. This was done with the support of the peasant masses, while in the Soviet Union, before the large-scale organization of collective farms, mutual-aid teams had already been quite widespread. Therefore, although there are some differences in some specific issues, the basic aspects are still learning from the experience of the Soviet Union.
    Cooperativization is the socialist road to develop agriculture; in addition, there is the capitalist road of rich peasant exploitation. These are two opposing roads. Not long after we implemented land reform, the spontaneous tendency of capitalism developed day by day, and showed a trend of opposition to the socialist direction. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants, who account for 60 to 70 percent of China's rural population, originally generally in a semi-proletarian status, in order to get rid of poverty, and after a considerable period of experiencing the benefits of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, showed great enthusiasm for taking the socialist road. While the upper-middle peasants, who account for 20 to 30 percent of China's rural population, were quite wavering about agricultural cooperativization. Following the victory of land reform, the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism developed more and more sharply. In order to win this struggle, we followed Lenin's principles, learned from the example of the Soviet Union, combined with China's specific conditions, adhered to the class line of relying on the poor peasants, uniting the middle peasants, and eliminating the rich peasants, and adhered to the two major principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit in cooperativization. In the countryside, after extensive ideological education, on the basis of constantly improving the class consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants, we first organized the poor and lower-middle peasants, and then gradually absorbed the upper-middle peasants, thus gradually realizing the comprehensive cooperativization of agriculture. Therefore, the development of the movement generally achieved both speed and health.
    Regarding the issue of agricultural mechanization, in the Soviet Union it was gradually completed at the same time as the completion of agricultural collectivization. However, under the conditions that our country's industry is not yet developed, the implementation of agricultural mechanization will be somewhat later. This is also in line with the basic principles of socialist transformation of agriculture. According to the Marxist-Leninist theory of agricultural cooperativization and the actual situation in our country after cooperativization, even in the absence of machines and completely manual operation, but because cooperativization has been realized and the relations of production have been fundamentally changed, it is entirely possible to achieve: "Everyone does their best, the land is used to its full potential, and everything is used to its fullest extent", thereby greatly liberating agricultural productive forces and promoting the development of agricultural production. It should also be seen that our cooperativization movement was realized on the basis of thorough land reform, greatly improved mass class consciousness, increasingly serious polarization in the countryside, and a high degree of enthusiasm among the broad masses of peasants for taking the socialist road. Therefore, this is in line with the process of historical development and is completely correct. Some people believe that there can be no collectivization without mechanization, and some people want to delay cooperativization in order to wait for mechanization. Facts have proved that these are mechanical and erroneous views. Of course, we also oppose another kind of erroneous idea, that is, denying that our agriculture must be gradually mechanized. It should be affirmed that the implementation of technological reform is a major task after the realization of agricultural cooperativization. Only by gradually realizing the technological reform of agriculture can labor productivity be greatly improved, and it will be more conducive to the large-scale development of agricultural production. We should recognize that the realization of cooperativization and the increase in agricultural production are, on the one hand, to improve the lives of peasants; on the other hand, to support industrial construction, and at the same time to create conditions for the future implementation of agricultural mechanization.
    Finally, when commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution, we should earnestly strengthen and consolidate agricultural cooperatives, and resolutely strive for the realization of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) and for the complete victory of socialist construction!

    学习苏联农业集体化的经验
    ——纪念十月社会主义革命四十周年
    陈正人
    伟大的十月革命所开辟的道路，是全世界无产阶级自求解放的必由之路。无产阶级要自求解放，要革命，就必须寻找同盟军。苏联的经验证明了：劳动农民是无产阶级进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设最巩固的同盟军。无产阶级只有与广大的劳动农民群众结成联盟，才能取得胜利；而广大的劳动农民群众，也只有在无产阶级的领导下，才能免除地主、资产阶级的剥削，以达到彻底的解放。
    苏联是世界上第一个由无产阶级领导、实行土地制度改革的国家。苏维埃政权建立后所颁布的第二个法令，就是没收地主阶级土地的“土地法令”。苏联是第一个实现了农业集体化和高度机械化的国家。苏联在不同的历史时期解决工农联盟问题的经验，就其基本点来说，具有适合于世界各国革命和建设的普遍意义。
    中国革命是十月社会主义革命的继续，我们一向都是非常重视着苏联这些宝贵经验。在实现农业集体化，即是对农业进行社会主义改造的问题上，同样是以苏联为榜样的。早在1943年，毛泽东同志就说过：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”我们在合作化运动中，为了逐步的改变农民的生活方式，并且为了能使农民取得切身经验和保证农业增产，因此，曾经历过一个半社会主义农业生产合作社的阶段，然后再转向完全社会主义的农业生产合作社。这样做取得了农民群众的拥护，而在苏联，大规模的进行组织集体农庄之前，共耕社则已相当的广泛了。所以，在有些具体问题上虽有所不同，而基本方面还是学习苏联的经验。
    合作化是发展农业的社会主义的道路；另外还有富农剥削的资本主义的道路，这是两条对立的道路。当我们实行土地改革之后不久，资本主义自发趋势日益发展，并表现着和社会主义方向的对立趋势。但是占我国农村人口百分之六十到七十的贫农和下中农，由于他们原来一般的处于半无产者的地位，为要摆脱贫困，经过相当长时期农业互助合作好处的体验，表现了走社会主义的巨大积极性。而占我国农村人口百分之二十到三十的上中农对于农业合作化相当一部分是动摇的。接着土改的胜利，资本主义和社会主义这样两条道路的斗争却日益尖锐的发展着。为了取得这个斗争的胜利，我们依照列宁的原则，学习苏联的榜样，结合中国具体情况，坚持了依靠贫农，团结中农，消灭富农的阶级路线，坚持了合作化中自愿、互利两大原则。我们在农村经过广泛的思想教育，在不断提高贫农下中农阶级觉悟的基础上，首先将贫农、下中农组织起来，然后再逐渐的吸收上中农，这样逐步地实现了农业的全面合作化。因此，运动的发展一般是做到了既迅速而又健康。
    关于农业机械化的问题，在苏联是和完成农业集体化的同时，即逐步地完成了。但是，在我国目前工业还不发达的条件下，实行农业机械化时间要稍后些。这也是符合于农业社会主义改造的基本原则的。依照马列主义的农业合作化的学说和我国合作化后的实际情况来看，即使缺乏机器，完全由手工操作，但由于实现了合作化，生产关系根本改变以后，完全可能做到：“人尽其才，地尽其利，物尽其用”，从而极大地解放农业生产力，推动农业生产的发展。还应该看到，我们的合作化运动，是在经过彻底的土地改革，群众的阶级觉悟有了很大提高；农村中两极分化日趋严重，广大农民群众对于走社会主义道路有很高的积极性的基础上实现的，所以，这是适合历史发展的进程，是完全做得对的。有的人认为没有机械化就不可能有集体化，有的人为了要等机械化而推迟合作化，事实证明这些都是机械的错误的观点。当然，我们也反对另外一种错误的想法，即否认我国农业必须逐步机械化。应该肯定实行技术改革，是农业合作化实现以后的重大任务。只有逐步实现了农业的技术改革，才能更大地提高劳动生产率，才更有利于大量发展农业生产。我们应该认识，实现合作化，增加农业生产，一方面是为了改善农民生活；一方面又是为了支援工业建设，同时也是为了将来实行农业机械化创造条件。
    最后，当纪念伟大的十月革命四十周年的时候，我们应该认真的加强巩固农业合作社，为实现全国农业发展纲要草案，为社会主义建设的完满胜利而坚决奋斗！
