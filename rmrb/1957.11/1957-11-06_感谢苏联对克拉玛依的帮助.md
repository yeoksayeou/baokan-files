Thanks to the Soviet Union for its Help to Karamay

		Qin Feng, Director of the Karamay Mining Bureau

	The Karamay oilfield, from its initial exploration and discovery to its current scale of development, is inseparable from the tremendous assistance of the Soviet Union. During the period of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company joint venture, many Soviet geologists successively carried out various geological exploration work in this area. In 1954, Comrade Uvalov led a geological team to complete the geological survey work. He affirmed that the hope of finding oil here was very high. At the end of 1955, the No. 1 exploratory well he designated struck oil, and the news spread throughout the country.

	After the first well produced oil, many geologists still underestimated the oil prospects and exploration scale here, and only suggested drilling in an area of two square kilometers. In early 1956, Soviet geologist Andreyko came to Xinjiang. After listening to the opinions of other geologists, studying various materials, and conducting on-site investigations, he gave a very high evaluation of the oil prospects in Karamay and advocated large-scale drilling.

	Large-scale drilling operations require a large amount of equipment and materials. However, our material foundation was very weak. At this time, the Soviet people gave sincere assistance, and the equipment and materials they created through hard work were continuously supplied to us. Of the various types of drilling machines and equipment used in drilling operations, 30,000 to 40,000 tons are supplied by the Soviet Union every year.

	Large-scale drilling operations are not always smooth sailing. As more and more oil wells are drilled and more and more crude oil is extracted, how to manage these oil wells and obtain the data needed for oilfield development design is a major problem for us. Soviet comrades provided us with timely and strong assistance in this regard.

	The winter of 1956 was the first winter of developing Karamay. Doing a good job in frost prevention and insulation was a prominent problem in drilling operations at that time. This problem made us very worried because there was a lack of wooden boards for well site insulation and no boilers for oil well insulation. Soviet experts saw this situation and proposed two methods that were adapted to local conditions and used local materials. That is, using the nearby reeds to weave reed curtains to insulate the well site; and using steel pipes to make small tubular boilers, using natural gas extracted from the well as fuel to burn steam to insulate the oil wells. They put in a lot of thought before proposing these methods. Comrade Pan Niankovsky almost walked through the entire warehouse in order to solve the problem of trial-producing small boilers, and finally found pipe materials suitable for manufacturing small boilers.

	Soviet experts not only provided assistance in drilling operations, but also provided regular guidance for oilfield development preparation work. Not long ago, the Soviet expert working group of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry came to Karamay and personally helped us formulate an oilfield development preparation plan, suggested that we carry out oilfield water injection experiments, and clarified the direction for the rational development of oilfields in the future.

	During the years of working with Soviet comrades, what we felt most deeply was their lofty internationalist spirit and strong sense of responsibility. In the second half of last year, in order to meet the needs of production and life, it was decided to divert the water of the Manas River, which is 40 kilometers away, to Karamay. We had no experience in building pump houses and laying water pipes, and none of the experts were proficient in this profession, but they still tried their best to help. Comrade Pan Niankovsky went to the bank of the Manas River many times to personally participate in the work of selecting the pump house site, and he had to study relevant reference books when he returned at night. Finally, he put forward many effective suggestions on the construction of the pump house and the anti-corrosion of the water pipes, which played a great role in the smooth completion of this major project.

	Turbine drilling is an advanced drilling technology that no one knew how to master in the past. Comrade Mikhailov taught on the first well using turbine drilling tools, first giving lectures to the workers, and then personally operating to show them. In less than three months, the well team workers mastered this new technology, and the drilling speed increased several times.

	The people in Karamay clearly remember such an event. A serious blowout accident occurred in Well No. 2. The ejected water column was as high as thirty to forty meters, freezing on the derrick and forming a tall ice tower all around. People could not enter the well platform. The expert team leader Popov and another seven or eight experts came from Urumqi and Dushanzi to participate in the accident handling work. Together with our workers, they fought the accident for several days and nights in the severe cold of minus thirty degrees. Finally, the experts led the workers, braving the water column that was ejected from the well under high pressure and would immediately freeze when it fell, rushed to the well platform, used pre-made tools to close the wellhead, and stopped the blowout. This incident quickly spread throughout the well teams and left us with an indelible impression.

	Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the joint efforts of all ethnic groups, Karamay is developing faster.

	On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, we sincerely thank the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and Soviet experts for their comprehensive and tremendous assistance in the petroleum construction of Karamay. In the future, we will redouble our efforts to build our country's petroleum industry, strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, and build our country into a strong, industrialized socialist country more quickly.

    感谢苏联对克拉玛依的帮助
    克拉玛依矿务局局长　秦峰
    克拉玛依油田从开始勘探、发现，直到发展成为目前的规模，都是与苏联的巨大援助分不开的。在前中苏石油公司合营期间，有许多苏联地质家先后对这个地区进行了各种地质勘探工作。1954年乌瓦洛夫同志率领了一支地质队，完成了地质普查工作。他肯定地认为这里含油希望是很大的。1955年底，他所定的第一号探井钻出油来了，这个消息传遍了全国。
    第一口井出油了，许多地质家对这里的含油远景及勘探规模仍估计不足，只建议在两平方公里的面积上钻探。1956年初，苏联地质家安德烈柯来到新疆，他听取了其他地质家的意见，研究了各方面的资料，就地进行了调查以后，对克拉玛依的含油远景，给予了极高的评价，并主张大规模钻探。
    进行大规模的钻探工作，需要有大量的设备器材。而我们的物质基础是十分薄弱的。这时，苏联人民给予了真诚的援助，把他们辛勤劳动创造出来的设备器材源源供应我们。在钻探工作中使用的各型钻井机器及各种器材，每年有三、四万吨都是苏联供应的。
    大规模钻探工作并不是一帆风顺的。钻完的油井多了，采出的原油多了，如何管理好这批油井与取得油田开发设计所需的数据，对我们来讲是一个大问题。苏联同志在这方面给予了我们及时的、有力的帮助。
    1956年冬天，是开发克拉玛依的第一个冬天。做好防冻保温工作，是当时钻探工作中的一个突出问题。这个问题使我们很为担心，因为井场保温缺乏木板，油井保温没有锅炉。苏联专家看出这种情况，提出了两项因地制宜、就地取材的办法。这就是利用附近的芦苇，编成苇帘保温井场；利用钢管自制小型管式锅炉，用由井内采出的天然气作燃料，烧蒸气保温油井。在提出这些办法之前，他们不知花了多少心思。潘念考夫斯基同志为了解决试制小锅炉的问题，几乎走遍了整个库房，终于找到了适合制造小锅炉的管材。
    苏联专家不仅在钻探工作中给予帮助，而且对油田开发准备工作也给予经常的指导。不久前，石油工业部苏联专家工作组来到克拉玛依，亲自帮助我们拟定了油田开发准备工作方案，建议我们进行油田注水试验工作，明确了今后合理开发油田的方向。
    在与苏联同志共同工作的岁月里，使我们感受最深的，就是他们崇高的国际主义精神和强烈的工作责任感。去年下半年，为了满足生产和生活的需要，决定把四十公里以外的玛纳斯河水引到克拉玛依来。我们没有建造泵房和铺设水管的经验，专家当中也没有人精通这个专业，但是他们仍然竭尽全力予以帮助。潘念考夫斯基同志曾多次去玛纳斯河岸，亲自参加选择泵房地址的工作，晚上回来还要钻研有关参考书籍。最后，他终于对泵房建设及水管防腐问题，提出了不少有效的建议，对这项重大工程的顺利完成起了很大作用。
    涡轮钻井是一门先进的钻井技术，过去我们没有人会掌握。米海依洛夫同志就在第一口使用涡轮钻具的井上传授，先给工人讲课，然后又亲自操作给他们看。不到三个月功夫，井队工人就掌握了这门新技术，钻井速度提高好几倍。
    在克拉玛依的人们都清楚地记得这样一件事。二号井发生了严重井喷事故。喷出的水柱高达三十——四十公尺，冻结在井架上，从四周围成一座高大的冰塔。人们无法进入井台。专家组长波波文同另外七、八位专家，特地从乌鲁木齐和独山子赶来参加处理事故的工作。他们同我们的工人一起，在零下三十几度的严寒条件下，与事故接连搏斗了几昼夜。最后，专家带领了工人，冒着在高压下从井内喷出的、落下来就会立即结冰的水柱、冲上了井台，用预先做好的工具关住了井口，制止了井喷。这件事很快传遍了井队，给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。
    现在，克拉玛依正在共产党的领导下和各民族的共同努力下，以更快的速度向前发展着。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的前夕，我们衷心感谢苏联人民、苏联政府和苏联专家对克拉玛依石油建设的全面的、巨大的援助。今后，我们将加倍努力建设祖国的石油工业，来加强中苏友谊，更快地把我们的祖国建设成为强大的、工业化的社会主义国家。
