The 1957 National Table Tennis Championships adopted the competition format of the World Table Tennis Championships, including the competition methods for men's and women's team events and the method of placing seeded teams or seeded players in each group. Some readers are not very familiar with this competition format, so we will briefly explain it here:

The competition method for men's team event: Each team sends three players, and the two sides take turns playing singles, for a total of nine matches; the competition adopts a best-of-nine format, meaning that if one side wins five matches, it is considered to have won, and the competition will no longer continue.

The competition method for women's team event: Each team sends two players, first playing two singles matches, one doubles match, and then two more singles matches; the competition adopts a best-of-five format, and when one side has already won three matches, it is considered to have won, and the competition will no longer continue.

The singles and doubles matches in team events generally adopt a best-of-three games format, with each game won by the first to reach twenty-one points.

When grouping for competitions, based on prior knowledge, some teams or players with relatively strong strength are arranged as evenly as possible in each group. These teams or players are called seeded teams or seeded players, and it is estimated that they will be able to become the champions of their respective groups in future competitions.

Of course, this arrangement of "seeds" may be overturned by the actual situation of the competition due to insufficient prior understanding of the situation. However, because there are many teams participating in large-scale table tennis competitions, and the competition time cannot be too long, it is necessary to adopt a grouping competition method. If seeded teams or seeded players are not reasonably placed during the grouping competition, it is likely that too many strong teams or strong players will be concentrated in some groups, and during the grouping competition, the stronger teams or players will be eliminated by the strongest teams or players. Therefore, evenly arranging seeded teams or seeded players into each group is a more suitable format for large-scale table tennis competitions.

    什么叫团体赛和种子队
    1957年全国乒乓球锦标赛采用了世界乒乓球锦标赛的比赛方式，其中男、女团体赛的比赛办法和在每个小组安插种子队或种子队员的办法。有些读者对这种比赛方式不大了解，我们在这里简单地解释一下：
    男子团体赛的比赛方式：每队出场三名选手，双方轮流进行单打，共进行九场；比赛采用九盘五胜制，即一方赢了五盘就算获得胜利，不再继续比赛。
    女子团体赛的比赛方式：每队出场选手二人，先进行两盘单打、一盘双打，再进行两盘单打；比赛采用五盘三胜制，当一方已经赢得三盘就算获得胜利，不再继续进行比赛。
    团体赛的单打和双打，一般是采用三局两胜制，每局都是以先赢二十一分的获胜。

    在分组进行比赛时，按照事先的了解，将一些实力比较强的队或选手，尽可能平均地安插在各个小组里，这些队或选手就叫种子队或种子队员，估计他们在将来的比赛中能够成为小组的冠军。
    当然，这种安排“种子”的预计由于事先对情况了解不够，也有可能被比赛实际情况所推翻。但是，由于在大规模的乒乓球比赛中，参加比赛的队很多，而比赛的时间又不能拉得太长，因此不得不采用分组比赛的办法。如果在分组比赛时，不合理安插种子队、种子队员，很可能在有的小组内集中了过多的强队或强的选手，在分组比赛时，较强的队或选手又被最强的队或选手淘汰了。因此向各小组平均地安插种子队或种子队员，在大规模的乒乓球比赛中是一种较适合的形式。
