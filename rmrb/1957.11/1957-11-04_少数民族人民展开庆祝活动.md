Xinhua News Agency, November 1st: The people of all ethnic minorities in our country are full of enthusiasm for the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and are widely launching celebrations in various forms.

　　In Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the city is already filled with a festive atmosphere. Photo exhibitions introducing the achievements of the Soviet Union's construction in various fields over the past 40 years have been held in all major streets and more than 40 factories, mines, enterprises, and schools throughout the city. Dozens of Party reporters are giving reports to cadres, workers, and students of all ethnic groups in various agencies, schools, factories, and mines throughout the city, introducing the great achievements of Soviet construction and the tremendous assistance given by Soviet experts to various constructions in Xinjiang. Various agencies, organizations, schools, factories, and mines are also actively preparing to hold various celebration activities such as celebration meetings, gala evenings, torch and bonfire parties, academic lectures, art exhibitions, and poetry recitals. In addition, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has also invited Soviet experts in Urumqi to give reports to workers of all ethnic groups throughout the city on topics such as diligence and thrift in national construction, labor emulation drives, and Soviet scientific achievements.

　　In Qinghai Province, where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, and the Xunhua Salar Autonomous County and other regions have already launched festival propaganda activities. Radio stations and cultural centers in various prefectures and counties have held broadcasts and exhibitions celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. These prefectures and counties, with townships as units, have the Party branch secretaries or heads of the townships report to the masses on the great achievements made by the people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In purely pastoral areas, the heads of the districts will report to the masses with the district as the unit. In the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, report meetings and lectures have been widely held.

　　The people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, the Honghe Hani Autonomous Prefecture, and the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province, as well as ethnic minority people distributed in other regions, are also actively launching celebration activities. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Autonomous Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Library jointly held a large-scale painting, picture, and book exhibition celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Mongolian and Hui reporters and propagandists in Hohhot have gone deep into factories, mines, construction sites, and urban areas to carry out propaganda activities in various ways, such as symposiums and courtyard meetings. Report meetings have been held successively in various places in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, and Honghe Hani Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, where reporters reported to the vast number of cadres in the autonomous prefectures (regions) on the great significance of the October Revolution and the achievements made by the Soviet Union in various aspects over the past 40 years. Photo exhibitions introducing the achievements of Soviet construction and Sino-Soviet friendship held on the streets and in the countryside of the capitals of various autonomous prefectures (regions) are visited by countless audiences of all ethnic groups every day. The "Zanha" (Dai folk singers) have also compiled the scientific achievements of the Soviet Union, such as launching artificial satellites, into lyrics and promoted them to the vast Dai people. Dai dance actor Mao Xiang and Hui dance actor Bai Wenfeng, who won silver medals at the Sixth World Youth and Students Peace and Friendship Festival, are sorting out their impressions of visiting factories and collective farms in Moscow and other places, and are preparing to introduce them to people of all ethnic groups on November 7. In Jishou, the capital of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province, many reporters are reporting to cadres of various agencies on the great achievements of the Soviet Union in the past 40 years. At the same time, they are also holding activities such as the "Great Soviet Union 40 Years" photo exhibition, the Soviet Science Lecture and the Soviet Film Exhibition Week.
