Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 13th: Soviet Deputy Doctor of Physiological Sciences, Isakov, said that by the time of the fiftieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, some Soviet scientists may hold a celebration on the moon, just as some Soviet scientists celebrated the fortieth anniversary on the Sixth Continent (Antarctica) this year. The launch of artificial satellites, especially the launch of the second satellite carrying an animal, marks the arrival of a new era in the history of science and the history of mankind's conquest of outer space. He believes that in the next five to ten years, humans will be able to enter outer space, and landing on other planets in the solar system may also become a reality.

The physiologist, who was awarded the Stalin Prize, recently discussed the various conditions for survival in future spaceflights in two articles published in the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" and "Industrial Economics". He said that whether it is an animal or a human, in space flight, it is necessary to use a sealed cabin that can maintain an air composition and pressure close to that on the ground.

He said that the method of carrying a large amount of liquid oxygen is very uneconomical. Soviet scientists have installed a special air conditioning system on the satellite that can remove nitrogen dioxide and excess moisture from the air, making the air suitable for breathing again.

When the air pressure drops to 47 cm of mercury (equivalent to atmospheric pressure at an altitude of 19 kilometers), the blood in the human body is about to "boil". The solution is to use a sealed cabin. He said that according to the experiments of the first two satellites, the possibility of the satellite colliding with a meteor and breaking the sealed cabin is unlikely, perhaps no greater than the possibility of a car collision on the road. Even if the sealed cabin is damaged, people can still wear diving suits or special high-altitude suits to ensure their safety.

Isakov said that the temperature changes in outer space are incomparably greater than on the ground, but the news from the artificial satellite carrying the dog shows that Soviet scientists have correctly solved the problem of maintaining the necessary temperature inside the satellite.

The article said that the problem of defending against the very strong solar ultraviolet and X-rays outside the atmosphere is quite simple. The cosmic rays are much more dangerous. He said that cosmic rays are composed of the nuclei of various chemical elements moving at speeds close to the speed of light. 80% of them are hydrogen nuclei, and there are also a small number of heavy nuclei, such as iron nuclei. When these particles fall on the body tissue, they will ionize molecules and damage cells. In terms of protecting against cosmic particles, the launch of the second satellite can provide extremely important materials. However, there is a certain period between the entry of cosmic particles into the body and their impact, several weeks or even months. Therefore, it is also necessary to return the animals on the artificial satellite to the ground for further observation.

Isakov said that people and animals can withstand any speed, but speed and acceleration are two different things. During rocket launch, the acceleration is extremely high, and the weight of the human body is equivalent to nine times its weight on the ground, while ordinary people can only withstand a sudden increase in body weight of three to five times. He said that there are still ways to improve this. If the direction of acceleration is from foot to head, there may be a large accumulation of blood in the lower body and insufficient blood in the upper body, which will damage the function of the central nervous system and even lead to loss of consciousness. If the acceleration acts perpendicular to the human body (such as when the human body is lying flat), the situation will be much better. There is also a special garment that can tightly hold each part of the body, preventing blood from accumulating in it, which also helps to overcome the phenomenon of increased body weight. He said that Laika's satisfactory health status after the launch and in the following days proves that Soviet scientists can also find ways to protect the normal life activities of the human body in experiments using animals.

    十月革命五十周年将会在月亮上庆祝
    新华社莫斯科13日电　苏联生理科学副博士伊萨科夫说，到伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年的时候，苏联一些科学家可能将在月亮上举行庆祝会，像今年一些苏联科学家在第六大洲（南极）上庆祝四十周年一样。人造卫星的发射，特别是带有动物的第二个卫星的发射，标志着科学史上、人类征服宇宙空间史上的新时期已经到来。他相信在最近五年到十年，人就可以进入宇宙空间，而在太阳系其他行星上着陆也可能成为现实。
    这位曾获斯大林奖金的生理学家最近在苏联“共青团真理报”和“工业经济报”上发表的两篇文章中探讨了在未来的宇宙飞行中生存的各种条件。他说，无论是动物，或是人，在宇宙空间飞行中，都要使用能够保持接近于地面的空气成分和压力的密封舱。
    他说，携带大量液态氧的办法是很不经济的。苏联科学家在卫星上安装了一套特殊的空气调节系统，可以清除空气中的二氧化氮和多余的水分，而使空气重新适合呼吸。
    在气压降到水银柱四十七厘米的时候（相当海拔十九公里高空大气压），人体内的血液即将“沸腾”。解决的方法就是使用密封舱。他说，根据头两个卫星的试验看来，卫星与流星相撞而使密封舱被打破的可能性不大，也许不会大于马路上汽车相撞的可能性。而即使密封舱受到损害，人还穿着潜水服或特制的高空服，可以保证生命安全。
    伊萨科夫说，宇宙空间中温度的变化要比地面大得无可比拟，然而从载有狗的人造卫星发来的消息说明，苏联科学家已经正确地解决了在卫星内部保持必要温度的问题。
    文章说，防卫大气层外十分强烈的太阳紫外线和X射线的问题是相当简单的。危险大得多的是宇宙线。他说，宇宙线由以接近光速的速度运动的各种各样化学元素的原子核组成。其中80％是氢核，也有少量是重原子核，如铁原子核等。这些粒子落到机体组织上就会使分子电离，破坏细胞。在防护宇宙粒子方面，第二个卫星的发射可以提供极重要的材料。然而，从宇宙粒子进入机体到它们发生影响之间还有一定时期，几周甚至几月。因此还有必要让人造卫星上的动物回到地面继续加以观察。
    伊萨科夫说，人和动物可以经得住任何速度，而速度与加速度是两回事。在火箭起飞时，加速度极大，人体的重量相当于在地面重量的九倍，而一般的人只能经住三到五倍的体重突增。他说，这也还是有办法来改善。如果加速的作用方向是从脚到头，就可能是身体下部积存大量的血，而上部的血液不足，使中枢神经机能受到破坏，甚至失去知觉。如果让加速的作用与人体成垂直方向（如人体平卧），情况就会好得多。还有一种专门服装可以紧紧箍住身体各部分，使血液不能在其中积存，这也有助于克服体重突增现象。他说，莱伊卡在起飞后及以后几天令人满意的健康状况证明，苏联科学家在利用动物的试验中也能找到保护人的机体的正常生命活动的方法。
