    How to Make Sweet and Sour Cabbage
    Now is the season for eating cabbage. Cabbage contains a significant amount of Vitamin C; it has a soft texture, is easy to digest, and has a delicious flavor.
    There are many ways to eat cabbage. Besides stir-frying it on its own, it can also be stir-fried (or braised) with various meats. In winter, it is even more delicious to add it to a casserole (or hot pot) for soup.
    Here's how to make sweet and sour cabbage:
    Cut the washed cabbage into pieces one inch wide and two inches long. Cut fresh (or dried) red peppers into thin strips. Blanch both in boiling water for two minutes. After removing them, place a layer of cabbage in a bowl, add a little salt, a few chili pepper strips, a little vinegar, and a little sugar. Layer it like this, tightly cover the bowl with a plate, and after two or three hours, it's ready to eat. Sweet and sour cabbage is not only a beautiful combination of red and white colors; it also has a flavor that combines sweetness, sourness, spiciness, and saltiness, making it very refreshing.

    酸辣白菜的做法
    现在正是吃白菜的季节。白菜含有相当多的丙种维生素；质地柔软，容易消化，味道鲜美。
    白菜的吃法很多，除了素炒，也可配在各种肉类中炒（或烧）了吃，冬天加在砂锅（或火锅）中煮汤，更是好吃。
    这里介绍的是酸辣白菜的做法：
    把洗净的白菜切成一寸宽、二寸长的块。把新鲜的（或干的）红辣椒切成细丝。把这两样都放在开水里滚两分钟，捞起来后，在碗里铺一层白菜，加少许精盐，放几根辣椒丝，浇一点醋，再加一点糖。这样一层一层铺好，碗上紧紧地盖一个碟子，等两三小时后，就可以吃了。酸辣白菜不仅颜色红白相间，十分好看；而且味道甜、酸、辣、咸兼而有之，非常爽口。
