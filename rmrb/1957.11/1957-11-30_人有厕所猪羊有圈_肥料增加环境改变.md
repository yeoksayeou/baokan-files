    People Have Toilets, Pigs and Sheep Have Pens; Fertilizer Increases, Environment Changes
    (Our newspaper, Hefei dispatch) More than one million farmers in the Bengbu and Fuyang special districts along the Huai River in Anhui Province have invested in a concentrated project to build toilets and livestock pens. In more than twenty days, the two special districts have rebuilt and newly built more than 680,000 toilets, more than 210,000 manure ponds, and more than 320,000 pig and sheep pens.
    The people on both sides of the Huai River had no habit of accumulating fertilizer in the past, so the phenomenon of people without toilets, livestock without pens, and human and animal manure flowing everywhere was formed. This not only made the fields lack fertilizer, but also had a very bad effect on environmental hygiene. Although there have been improvements in the past few years since liberation, it is still not thorough enough. For example, Xiao County in Huaibei has a population of 700,000 and more than 300,000 livestock. The annual loss of human and animal manure is more than 500 million catties, which can make 500,000 mu of farmland apply 1,000 catties of fertilizer per mu. In some places, even if fertilizer is accumulated, there is no habit of accumulating urine fertilizer. All human and animal manure is dried in the sun before being applied to the fields, reducing the fertilizer efficiency. The lack of pig and sheep pens not only affects the accumulation of fertilizer, but also causes great losses to crops. This year, the agricultural cooperatives in these two special districts regarded the construction of toilets and livestock pens as an important issue to solve fertilizer problems in the discussion of agricultural development plans. After discussion, they broke through the ideological obstacles of the masses, and each cooperative established a construction team and adopted the method of the cooperative contributing labor and the members contributing materials to carry out this work. As a result, a vigorous campaign to build toilets and livestock pens was launched. In Xiao County alone, more than 4,800 construction teams were established. Construction began in early November, and in 20 days, 79% of farmers had toilets and pig and sheep pens were built. By the end of November, the county will be able to achieve that every household has a toilet and pigs and sheep have pens.

    人有厕所猪羊有圈  肥料增加环境改变
    本报合肥电　安徽省沿淮河的蚌埠、阜阳两专区农民，有一百多万人投入了修盖厕所和牲畜圈的突击工程。在二十多天内两个专区改建和新建的厕所即已达六十八万多个、粪池二十一万多个、猪羊圈三十二万多个。
    淮河两岸的人民，过去没有积肥习惯，所以形成了人无厕所、牲畜无圈，人畜粪倒处流失现象。这样，不仅田地缺肥，对环境卫生也很不好。解放后几年来虽有改进，但还很不彻底。如淮北萧县有七十万人口，三十多万牲畜，每年流失的人畜粪达五亿多斤，可使五十万亩农田每亩施一千斤肥。有的地方即使积肥，也没有积尿水肥的习惯，都是把人畜粪晒干后上到地里去，肥效减低。猪羊无圈不但影响积肥，对庄稼损失也很大。今年这两个专区的农业社，在讨论农业发展规划中，都把修厕所、盖畜圈当作解决肥料的重要问题，经过讨论打破了群众的思想障碍，社社都建立了基建队，采取社出工、社员出料的办法专门进行这项工作。于是，一个轰轰烈烈的修厕所、盖畜圈的运动便开展了。只是肖县便成立了四千八百多个基建队，从11月初开始动工在二十天里就使79％的农户有了厕所，建了猪羊圈。到11月底这个县即可达到户户有厕所，猪羊都有圈。
