    Happy Snow, Congratulating Cadres on Going Down to the Countryside
    For three months, no rain fell, but suddenly snow flies in one morning.
    Every tree bursts forth with silver flowers, the earth is a blanket of white.
    Immediately quenching the parched thirst, moistening the mouth and nose.
    Cultivation can be nurtured, winter plowing becomes more active.
    Early winter brings snowfall, predicting a good spring wheat harvest.
    This is a great sweet rain, not merely hoping for clouds and rainbows.
    It also coincides with the rectification movement, cadres thoroughly going down to the countryside.
    Mountain areas and rural villages, launching great construction.
    Taking root and settling down, practically engaging in reform.
    Potential is fiercely tapped, a new page is turned in production.
    It is not just for streamlining, going down to the countryside is a broad path.
    This is a great revolution, gloriously entering the annals of history.
    I bow again and offer three wishes, respectfully seeing you off.
    First, I wish you good health, and determination to work in agriculture.
    Second, I wish you ambition, emphasizing unity everywhere.
    Third, I wish you great efforts, to double the per-mu yield.
    Urban and rural areas coordinate, simultaneously developing industry and agriculture.
    Work diligently for twenty years, to create a great and powerful nation.
    Looking back at going down to the countryside, how beautiful is the snow after the winter drought!

    喜雪，祝干部下放	陈毅
    三月久不雨，一朝忽飞雪。
    树树发银花，大地一遍白。
    立即去焦渴，润湿到口鼻。
    种植得培育，冬耕更积极。
    初冬有雪降，预卜好春麦。
    这是大甘霖，岂徒望云霓。
    又值整风时，干部下放澈。
    山区与农村，发动大建设。
    生根而落户，实际干改革。
    潜力猛发掘，生产开新页。
    岂仅为精简，下放路子阔。
    这是大革命，辉煌入史册。
    再拜祝三愿，谨以壮行色。
    一祝身体好，决心干农业。
    二祝有志气，处处重团结。
    三祝大努力，亩产加倍?。
    城乡两配合，并举工农业。
    勤劳二十年，造成大强国。
    回头看下放，美哉冬旱雪！
            写于11月25日大雪之日
