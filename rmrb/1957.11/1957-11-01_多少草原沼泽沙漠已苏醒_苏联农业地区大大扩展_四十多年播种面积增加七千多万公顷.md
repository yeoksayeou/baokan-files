Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 31st: In the forty years since the October Revolution, the geographical distribution of agricultural production in the Soviet Union has undergone tremendous changes. The production areas of various crops have advanced from the western and southern regions to the eastern and northern regions. With the expansion of agricultural technology and equipment, the development of water conservancy and irrigation, and the application of agricultural scientific achievements, many areas that were previously grasslands, marshes, arid lands, or deserts have awakened. Many new and important grain production areas and other agricultural product areas have appeared on the Soviet map.

From 1913 to 1956, the sown area in the Soviet Union increased by a total of 76.5 million hectares (each hectare equals 15 Chinese mu), with the national total sown area reaching approximately 195 million hectares. The newly added sown area in Kazakhstan, the Urals, Western Siberia, Eastern Siberia, and the Far East accounted for approximately 52.6 million hectares, accounting for about 70% of the total newly added sown area. The sown areas in the Volga River Basin and Kyrgyzstan also increased by 60% and 100% respectively. In 1913, Kazakhstan's wheat sown area was less than three-tenths of that of Ukraine, but last year it increased to 4.5 times that of Ukraine. Before the October Revolution, the grain sown area in Siberia and the Urals accounted for only one-quarter of the total grain sown area in the Russian Federation, but now it has increased to 42%. The wheat sown area in the eastern region of the Russian Federation has now reached approximately 20 million hectares, which is 2 million hectares more than the entire wheat sown area in the Russian Federation before the revolution.

Long before the Great Patriotic War, the main grain producing areas of the Soviet Union had shifted from the southwest regions such as Ukraine and Kuban to the east and north. During the Great Patriotic War, the grain produced east of the Volga River and in Siberia fed the people and the army of the whole country.

Now, the eastern region has become the most important grain producing area in the Soviet Union, with approximately two-thirds of the country's marketable grain coming from this region.

The rapid development of grain production in the eastern region is mainly due to the large-scale land reclamation in recent years. From 1954 to 1956, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government mobilized more than 350,000 young people and allocated more than 200,000 tractors and a large number of other agricultural machines to the eastern region for land reclamation, resulting in the reclamation of approximately 36 million hectares of virgin and fallow land in just three years. Of these, approximately 31 million hectares were reclaimed in Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Urals. This made the increase in sown area in the three years after 1954 almost equal to the sum of the increase in sown area in the forty years before 1953.

In addition to the eastward advancement of grain production, the geographical boundary of the Soviet cotton planting area has also advanced from 43 degrees north latitude to 49 degrees north latitude, extending northward by more than 600 kilometers. Now, not only have the Central Asian republics greatly expanded cotton production, but cotton is also produced in southern Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Moldova, Stalingrad Oblast, and many other regions. In the past, the areas where the Soviet Union grew a large amount of sugar beets were limited to Ukraine and Kursk Oblast, but now the sugar beet growing area has expanded to Central Asia, Siberia, the Baltic coast, the Far East, and even near the Arctic Circle.

### 多少草原沼泽沙漠已苏醒  苏联农业地区大大扩展  四十多年播种面积增加七千多万公顷

    多少草原沼泽沙漠已苏醒
    苏联农业地区大大扩展
    四十多年播种面积增加七千多万公顷
    据新华社莫斯科31日电　在十月革命后的四十年中，苏联农业生产的地理配置发生了巨大的变化。各种农作物的生产地区已经从西部和南部向东部和北部地区推进。随着农业技术装备的扩大、水利灌溉事业的发展和农业科学成就的运用，许多过去是草原、沼泽、干旱或沙漠的地区已经苏醒过来。在苏联地图上已经出现了许多新的重要的谷物产区和其他农产品产区。
    从1913年到1956年，苏联播种面积一共增加了七千六百五十万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩），全国总播种面积达到了一亿九千五百万公顷左右。而哈萨克、乌拉尔、西西伯利亚、东西伯利亚和远东这几个地区新增加的播种面积就有五千二百六十万公顷左右，约占全部新增加的播种面积的70％。伏尔加河流域和吉尔吉斯的播种面积也分别增加了60％和一倍左右。1913年，哈萨克的小麦播种面积还不到乌克兰的十分之三，而去年就增加到乌克兰的四点五倍。西伯利亚和乌拉尔的谷物播种面积在十月革命前只占俄罗斯联邦地区内全部谷物播种面积的四分之一，而现在已经增加到42％。俄罗斯联邦东部地区的小麦播种面积现已达到两千万公顷左右，比革命前整个俄罗斯联邦地区的小麦播种面积还多二百万公顷。
    远在卫国战争以前，苏联主要的谷物产地就由乌克兰和库班等西南地区移到东部和北部。在卫国战争中，伏尔加河以东和西伯利亚出产的粮食养活了全国的人民和军队。
    现在，东部地区已成为苏联最重要的产粮区，全国约有三分之二的商品谷物就来自这个地区。
    东部地区谷物生产的飞跃发展主要是由于最近几年来大规模开荒的结果。苏联共产党和政府在1954年到1956年动员了三十五万多青年，调拨了二十多万台拖拉机和大量其他农业机器到东部地区开荒，结果在短短的三年中就开垦了约三千六百万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地。其中在哈萨克、西伯利亚和乌拉尔开垦的就有三千一百万公顷左右。这就使得苏联在1954年以后三年中所增加的播种面积几乎等于1953年以前四十年中所增加的播种面积的总和。
    除了谷物生产向东推进以外，苏联植棉区域的地理界线也从北纬四十三度推进到北纬四十九度，即向北伸展了六百多公里。现在，不仅中亚细亚各共和国大大扩大了棉花的生产，而且在哈萨克南部、阿塞拜疆、乌克兰、摩尔达维亚、斯大林格勒州和其他许多地区也出产棉花了。过去，苏联大量种植甜菜的地区仅限于乌克兰和库尔斯克州，而现在，甜菜种植地区已经扩展到中亚细亚、西伯利亚、波罗的海沿岸、远东地区、甚至北极圈附近。
