Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 12th - President Sukarno returned to Jakarta on the 11th after a twelve-day inspection tour of the Lesser Sunda Islands and the Maluku Islands. Throughout the Lesser Sunda Islands, he repeatedly called on the people to unite and fight for the liberation of West Irian.

During a speech at a mass rally in Bali on his way back to Jakarta, President Sukarno said that if the attempt to resolve the West Irian issue through the United Nations failed, Dutch property in Indonesia would be confiscated.

President Sukarno pointed out that the Netherlands has a total of 2.5 billion盾 in capital in Indonesia, from which it exploits 600 million盾 in dividends annually.

President Sukarno also recently said at a mass rally on the island of Lombok that the Indonesian government would sever trade relations with the Netherlands if necessary. At another mass rally on the same island, he said that he believed Indonesia could trade with countries such as West Germany, China, Yugoslavia, and India instead of trading with the Netherlands.
