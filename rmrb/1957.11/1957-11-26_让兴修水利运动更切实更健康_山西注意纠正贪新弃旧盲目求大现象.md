Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Electric Dispatch: The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction recently required all localities to take measures to bring into play the effectiveness of existing water conservancy projects.

At present, rural water conservancy construction projects in Shanxi Province have reached an unprecedented scale. However, there is a widespread phenomenon of "greed for the new and abandonment of the old," emphasizing the development of new projects and neglecting repair work. With the exception of Changzhi and Yanbei areas, which are renovating old projects, adding new equipment, leveling land, and improving irrigation channels to expand the irrigation area by utilizing existing equipment, this work has not been carried out or is progressing very slowly in many other areas of the province. Some counties not only lack concrete plans for the utilization of old projects in their winter-spring production plans, but also lack arrangements for field surface projects for the water conservancy projects currently under construction. If the current situation continues to develop, not only will the potential of existing equipment not be fully utilized, but the actual beneficiary area of this year's newly built projects will also be affected.

According to the materials investigated by the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Department, after renovating and repairing water conservancy projects that have not played a role and unfinished water conservancy projects, the province can irrigate at least 2 million mu of cultivated land on the basis of the original water conservancy projects. It is not troublesome to renovate these projects. The experience of many agricultural cooperatives in Jieyu, Linyi, Quwo, and other counties proves that only one or two workdays are needed to connect horizontal pipes and cone wells to lower springs in old wells with insufficient water sources to expand the water source and increase the water volume.

The main reason why existing water conservancy projects cannot be fully utilized is the lack of water conveyance projects such as field surface branch canals and capillary canals. The second is the lack of water sources and water lifting tools. Some mechanical equipment is frequently out of use due to lack of repair. After analyzing and studying these problems, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction has organized relevant departments to cooperate in solving them and required all localities to strengthen leadership over this work.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 25: Gaoping County, Shanxi Province, is formulating practical and reliable farmland water conservancy construction plans, correcting the wasteful phenomenon of blindly pursuing bigness in the past, which resulted in "seeing only projects but not irrigating fields." At present, many townships and agricultural cooperatives have made realistic plans for this winter-spring water conservancy projects and various farm work based on the amount of labor available, focusing on small-scale projects that can yield benefits in the current year and a few large-scale projects within the reach of the labor force. Projects that cannot be developed this year due to insufficient labor are included in next year's plan.

Of the more than 130,000 mu of irrigated land completed in Gaoping County in the past two years, only 90,000 mu of land can actually be irrigated, with about one-third of the irrigated land unable to receive water. In some cases, canals have been opened, but the land has not been leveled, so water cannot enter the land. In other cases, reservoirs or storage ponds have been built, but canals have not been opened in time, and water still has to be carried from far away during droughts. Agricultural cooperatives have learned from this lesson and made reasonable plans from the beginning of this year. The Hongxiang Agricultural Cooperative in Nan'ge Village has only 400 laborers. It originally planned to invest 90% of its labor to build a reservoir and a canal, benefiting more than 1,600 mu of land, so that 30% of the cooperative's land could be irrigated. However, after calculation, this would affect fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, sideline occupations, and animal husbandry. Moreover, spring plowing, sowing, and fertilizer transportation next spring would be crowded together, and there would be no strength to build diversion canals for the reservoir or to carry out land leveling work. Therefore, the project would only benefit in 1959. Next year, not only would irrigation not be achieved, but production would be affected. Finally, they reduced the project based on actual possibilities, ensuring that they could expand more than 700 mu of irrigated land, which could benefit in the current year. The remaining projects will be carried out next winter.

    让兴修水利运动更切实更健康
    山西注意纠正贪新弃旧盲目求大现象
    据新华社太原电　山西省农业建设厅最近要求各地采取措施，发挥原有水利工程的效用。
    目前，山西省农村水利建设工程已达到空前规模。但是，普遍地存在着重开发工程、轻整修工作的“贪新弃旧”现象。全省除长治、雁北地区改造旧工程、增添新设备、平田整地改善灌溉渠道，发挥旧有工程设备扩大灌溉面积外，其它许多地区此项工作没有开展起来或进展很慢。有些县在今冬明春生产计划中不仅没有具体计划旧工程的利用问题，甚至对正在兴修的水利工程也缺乏田面工程的安排。有的县还把一些改善灌溉渠道的专职干部也拉去从事新的水利工程的开发工作。按照目前的情况发展下去，不仅原有工程设备不能发挥潜力，今年新修工程的实际受益面积也将受到影响。
    据山西省水利部门调查的材料，对没有发挥作用的水利工程和未完成的遗留的水利工程，加以改造、整修以后，全省至少可以在原有水利工程的基础上增浇二百万亩耕地。改造这些工程并不费事，解虞、临猗、曲沃等县许多农业社的经验证明，只需要一两个工，在水源不足的旧井中，通横管、锥井下泉，扩大水源，水量就可以增加。
    原有的水利工程不能得到充分利用的原因，主要是缺乏田面斗渠、毛渠等输水工程。其次是水源和提水工具不足，有些机械设备因缺乏修理，经常停止使用。山西省农业建设厅分析研究这些问题以后，已组织有关部门配合解决，并要求各地加强对此项工作的领导。
    据新华社太原25日电　山西省高平县在制定切实可靠的兴修农田水利规划，纠正了过去盲目求大造成“只见工程，不见浇田”的浪费现象。目前许多乡、农业社把今冬明春的水利工程和各种农活，根据劳动力多少做了切合实际的规划，集中进行可在当年收益的小型工程和劳动力所及的少数大型工程；对一些在今年劳动力不及开发的工程，就列在明年规划中。
    高平县过去两年修成的十三万多亩水浇地，实际上只有九万亩土地能灌溉，约有三分之一的水地不能进水。有的是已经开了渠，但由于没有平整土地，水进不了地。有的是筑了水库或蓄水池，却没有来得及开渠道，天旱时仍要老远去担水，各农业社接受了这个教训，今年一开始就合理地进行了规划，南圪?村红响农业社只有四百多个劳动力，原打算投90％的劳动力去修建一个水库和一条水渠，受益面积一千六百多亩，全社土地可以达到30％水利化。可是一经计算，这样就会使积肥、造林、副业、畜牧业受到影响，而且明春的春耕、播种、运肥都挤在一起，没有力量为水库修筑引水渠道，也没有力量进行土地平整工作，因此工程完了也只有在1959年受益，明年不但达不到水利化，反会使增产受到影响。最后他们根据实际可能消减了工程，有把握扩大七百多亩水地，当年可以受益。其余的工程放在明年冬季进行。
