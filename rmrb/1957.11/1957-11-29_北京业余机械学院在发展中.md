Beijing Amateur Mechanical College is an independent engineering night university. It currently has only three office staff and two small offices. Classrooms are distributed in three locations, borrowing classrooms from the Industrial Management School, Cadre School, and Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, all affiliated with the Second Ministry of Machine Building. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the college will have used only 60% of its allocated funds, but has undertaken more than double the teaching load. The original plan was for 150 students, but now, including the upcoming preparatory class and auditing students in various classes, the number has reached 300.

After a year of practice, it has been proven that it is very necessary to run a night university independently in the factory area, and it is entirely possible to do so well by fully utilizing all favorable conditions. Judging from the learning situation in the last semester, more than 70% of the students had excellent or good grades, only 11% failed the semester exams, and after makeup exams and reviews, only 5% of the total number of students withdrew from the class due to excessive business trips or poor grades. The attendance rate reached 94.9%, and business trips accounted for 40% of the absent hours. Achieving this level of attendance in part-time study is relatively good.

Jointly establishing a night university in the factory area has its unique advantages. First, it can organize teaching in combination with the characteristics and specific conditions of the factory. The students mainly come from the factory, and more than 80% of the students are graduates of secondary technical schools, and most of them are directly engaged in technical work. They generally have rich perceptual knowledge and some practical work experience, and have a certain foundation in professional technology. Therefore, it is possible to arrange classes according to the characteristics of the students in the teaching plan.

Second, professional basic courses and professional courses can be taught by experienced engineers from the factory, which can promote the combination of theory and practice. These teachers generally have a full understanding of the factory's production process, and also have a full understanding of the students' level, because some students are cadres led by the teachers in the factory. They know best which aspects of the students' knowledge are insufficient and need to be supplemented and improved, and they can also cite examples and raise questions in their lectures in light of production practice, which is most welcomed by the students.

Third, the college is located in the factory area, which can maintain close contact with the factory leadership, grasp the students' learning situation, and improve teaching effectiveness. For students with poor learning performance, the college immediately goes to the factory where they work to understand the situation. Sometimes it is found that the original unit has not taken care of the students and has given them too much social work, and the college will make suggestions to the factory. The college organizes teachers to give tutoring to students with poor grades or excessive business trips. For students with poor learning discipline, the college will learn about and help them through the factory's Communist Youth League committee or personnel education department. In addition, the college organizes study groups according to factory units and elects factory representatives to strengthen the mutual contact and organization of review between students, factories, and the college. In terms of teaching work, the college constantly solicits students' opinions for improvement. The college is located in the factory area, which is centrally located, greatly reducing the students' round-trip time and reducing fatigue, which is also a favorable condition for good study.

Independently running a night university also has its difficulties. The more prominent ones are the lack of teaching experience, the lack of teachers and teaching equipment in basic courses (such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry), etc. To solve these difficulties, it is necessary to rely on the help of higher colleges and close cooperation with other schools. Tsinghua University, Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College, and Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration have been of great help to the Mechanical College. For example, Tsinghua University provided a complete set of teaching plans, teaching calendars, and textbooks, and even supplied printed lecture notes. Other higher colleges supported teachers for higher education, and they were teachers with rich teaching experience.

Night university is an important way to cultivate intellectuals of the working class. Through night university, it is possible to cultivate professional talents who combine theory and practice, but night university is different from regular higher education institutions after all. Students have to work and study at the same time. Therefore, it requires strong perseverance to persevere for a long time. In fact, the students did not realize these problems from the beginning. Most of the students initially entered the school with enthusiasm, and some of them stagnated when they encountered difficulties. Some put forward excessive demands, hoping to have the level of Tsinghua University, and some regarded learning as higher than everything else, thus conflicting with work. There are also some students who regard going to night university as a temporary foothold, always feeling that night school is not as good as regular university, and take a frivolous attitude towards night school courses. These should be corrected.

The students have a heavy burden of study and work, spending more than 20 hours of spare time each week attending classes and reviewing. Therefore, it is also necessary to require the leaders of various factories to provide appropriate learning conditions, such as minimizing spare time activities, minimizing business trips, and providing a relatively quiet learning environment as much as possible.

In order to further improve this new type of night university, the college plans to continue to establish preparatory classes to improve the admission level of future students. The college also plans to comprehensively revise the teaching plan, refer to the revised teaching plan of Tsinghua University, formulate a draft based on its own characteristics and organize extensive discussions, appropriately reduce the number of class hours, appropriately compress professional courses, and add elective courses. At the same time, in conjunction with factory needs, it will add majors such as machine manufacturing, enterprise economics, organization and planning.

Despite the many difficulties on the road ahead, the Amateur Mechanical College will move forward together with the help of brother colleges and universities.

    北京业余机械学院在发展中	虞辟
    北京业余机械学院是一个独立的工科夜大学。现在仅有三个办公人员和两间小办公室。教室分布在三个地方，借用了第二机械工业部所属工业管理学校、干部学校和北京农业机械厂的教室，预计到年底为止，学院仅用了所拨给经费的60％，但是，却负担了超过一倍的教学任务，原来计划学员是一百五十名，现在，包括即将开始的预备班和各班的旁听生在内已达到三百名。
    经过一年来的实践，证明了在工厂区自办夜大学是非常必要的，而且在充分利用各方面有利条件下，是完全有可能办好的。从上学期的学习情况来看，学生学习成绩优良或良好的占70％以上，学期考试不及格的只占11％，最后经补考审查确因出差过多和成绩过差而退班者占全体学员人数5％。在出勤率方面达到94．9％，在缺勤时数中出差时数又占40％。在业余学习中，能达到这种出勤情况，还是比较好的。
    在工厂区联合创办夜大学有其独特的优点。首先，它能结合工厂的特点和具体情况组织教学。学生的来源主要是工厂，在学员中80％以上的是中等技术学校毕业的，绝大部分又都是直接做技术工作的。他们一般感性知识丰富，又有些实际工作锻炼，专业技术有一定基础，因此在教学计划安排上就有可能按照学员特点分班。
    其次，专业基础课和专业课程可由工厂中有经验的工程师担任，能促进理论与实践的结合。这些教师一般对工厂的生产过程有充分了解，而且对学员水平也有充分了解，因为有些学员就是教师在工厂中所领导的干部。对于学员那些方面的知识不足，需要补充提高，知道得最清楚，讲课中又能针对生产实践举出实例和提出问题，也最能受到学员的欢迎。
    第三，学院设在工厂区，能与工厂领导上取得密切联系，掌握学员学习情况，提高教学效果。学院对于学习情况不好的学员，即深入他所在的工厂了解情况，有时发现原单位未予照顾而给予学员过多社会工作时，就向工厂提出意见。对学习成绩不好或出差过多的学员，学院就组织老师补课。对学习纪律不好的同学，学院就通过工厂团委或人事教育部门进行了解和帮助。此外，学院还按工厂单位组织学习小组，推选厂代表以加强学员与工厂和学院之间的相互联系和组织复习。在教学工作方面，学院不断征求学员意见进行改进。学院设在工厂区内，地点适中，大大减少了学员往返时间，减少疲劳，也是学习好的一个有利条件。
    独立办好夜大学也有它困难的地方，比较突出的是缺乏教学经验、缺乏基础课（如数理化课程）方面的师资和教学设备等，要解决这些困难，就必须依靠高等学院的帮助和其他学校的密切配合。清华大学、北京农业机械化学院和北京地质勘探学院对机械学院帮助很大。如清华大学供给全套的教学计划、教学日历以及教材等，甚至还供应印好的讲义。其他高等学院支援了高等教学的教师，而且是具有较丰富教学经验的教师。
    夜大学是培养工人阶级知识分子的一个重要途径。通过夜大学更能培养理论与实际结合的专业人才，但是夜大学毕竟不同于正规的高等学校，学员要一边工作，一边学习。因此，需要有坚强的毅力，才能长期坚持下来。实际上，学员们并不是一开始就体会到这些问题的，大多数的学员起初是凭着热情考进来的，其中有些碰到困难就停滞不前了。有的提出了过高的要求，希望能有像清华大学那样的水平，有的把学习认为高于一切，因而和工作对立起来。也有一些学员，把上夜大学做为临时据点，总觉得夜校不如正规大学好，对待夜校课程采取轻率的态度。这些都应该纠正。
    学员的学习工作负担都很重，每周要花费二十多小时业余时间来上课和复习，因此，也必须要求各工厂领导上给予适当的学习条件，如尽量减少业余活动，尽量减少出差，尽可能地给予较安静的学习环境。
    为了进一步办好这所新型夜大学，今后，学院准备继续创办预备班，提高今后的学员入学水平。学院还准备全面修改教学计划，参考清华大学修改后的教学计划，结合自己的特点订出草案后广泛组织讨论，上课学时数将要适当减少，专业课程适当压缩，并增设选修课程，同时结合工厂需要，增设机器制造、企业经济、组织与计划等专业。
    尽管在前进的道路上，还有很多困难，业余机械学院将在各兄弟院校帮助下共同前进。
