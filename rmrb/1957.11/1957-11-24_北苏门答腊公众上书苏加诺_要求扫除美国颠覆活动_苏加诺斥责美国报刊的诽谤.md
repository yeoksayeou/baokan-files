Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 22nd: According to a report by Antara News Agency on the 21st, Indonesian President Sukarno, in Medan, denounced an article about Indonesia in the November 17th issue of the American magazine "Time" for slandering him.

Sukarno said in a speech to the welcoming crowd at Medan Airport: "Although the imperialist press often insults and accuses me, saying that I am 'only supported by a small group of yes-men', I often thank Allah that 90% of the Indonesian people continue to carry out the national revolution with me."

He said, "Since 1927, I have been reminding you, 'If the imperialists insult and slander you, it means you are doing the right thing, but beware of the imperialists praising you.'"

On the 21st, Sukarno met in Medan with a joint delegation from three organizations: the North Sumatra National Peace Committee, the North Sumatra 1945 Comrades Association, and the North Sumatra People's Congress. The delegation presented Sukarno with a statement requesting the government and the National Council to take clear and correct steps to deal with the American conspiracy to subvert the Indonesian government and to completely eliminate all subversive activities.

In the statement, the joint delegation also expressed the hope that the government would ban the import of foreign magazines such as "Time" and "Newsweek," accusing these magazines of damaging Indonesia's sovereignty and integrity and slandering Indonesian leaders.

President Sukarno went to Medan on the 20th to attend the founding ceremony of the University of North Sumatra and returned to Jakarta yesterday afternoon.

    苏加诺斥责美国报刊的诽谤
    新华社雅加达22日电　据安塔拉通讯社21日报道，印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在棉兰指责美国“时代”周刊11月17日一期里面关于印度尼西亚的一篇文章对他进行诽谤。
    苏加诺在棉兰机场对欢迎他的群众演讲说：“虽然帝国主义报刊经常辱骂和指责我，说我‘只受一小撮唯唯诺诺的人的支持’，我经常感谢真主，印度尼西亚人民90％和我一起继续进行民族革命”。
    他说，“自从1927年以来，我一直提醒你们，‘要是帝国主义者辱骂和诽谤你，那就是说你作得对，可是要提防着帝国主义者恭维你’。”
    苏加诺21日在棉兰接见了北苏门答腊全国和平委员会、北苏门答腊1945年同志会和北苏门答腊人民代表大会等三个组织的联合代表团，这个代表团把一项声明交给苏加诺，要求政府和民族委员会采取明确和正确的步骤对付美国颠覆印度尼西亚政府的阴谋活动和彻底扫除一切颠覆活动。
    联合代表团在声明中还表示希望政府禁止像“时代”和“新闻周刊”这类外国杂志进口，声明指责这些杂志损害印度尼西亚的主权完整和毁谤印度尼西亚的领导人。
    苏加诺总统在20日到棉兰去参加北苏门答腊大学的成立典礼，在昨天下午回到雅加达。
