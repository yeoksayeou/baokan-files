Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th: Soviet Guard Colonel Hual Walov recently published an article in the Soviet magazine "Young Technician," stating that the Soviet Union's atomic-powered aircraft has already conducted its first flight test. After further research, the first batch of atomic planes taking to the skies is not far off. In the future, supersonic non-stop round-the-world flights will become commonplace. Atomic engines will take people to the highest layers of the stratosphere and pave the way for access to the universe.

The article, titled "Aviation of Tomorrow," points out that in the reactor of an atomic aircraft, the kinetic energy of a large number of particles emitted by nuclear fission is converted into heat energy, which can generate temperatures of thousands of degrees. Using this to heat liquids and gases produces a large amount of high-temperature gas. This gas is ejected from the nozzle, which, like the nozzles of modern jet aircraft, can propel the aircraft forward at high speed.

To protect personnel and airports from radioactive radiation, atomic planes will be equipped with a combined atomic and conventional jet propulsion system. Conventional jet engines will be used for takeoff and ascent, while atomic engines will be used for general flight. The speed of the atomic plane can be determined by the temperature of the reactor or the change in the cross-section of the nozzle.

When discussing the possible designs of atomic-powered aircraft, Hual Walov said: To protect passengers from radioactive radiation, the aircraft will be very long, and a special biological protection device will be installed on the aircraft.

Not long ago, it was generally believed that an atomic engine with 75,000 horsepower would require about 60 tons of shielding. However, after research by scientists and engineers, it is believed that the weight of the protective equipment can be greatly reduced. In this way, the equipment problem for atomic engines on heavy aircraft weighing more than 100 tons is not difficult to solve.

The fuselage of an atomic plane can be made of high-temperature resistant materials—titanium, nickel, and other alloys. The operation of atomic aircraft and power plants should be automated to the greatest extent possible.

Hual Walov said: Atomic planes require very little fuel and can make non-stop round-the-world flights, circling again and again. When passengers on the plane need to disembark, they must first transfer to another small plane, which will land them on the ground. If they want to reach the atomic plane circling in the sky from the ground, they must first take a small plane. When this small plane approaches the atomic plane, the new passengers can pass through a special cabin and find a seat in the cabin of the atomic plane.

### 超速环球飞行将是平常事  苏联原子飞机升空为期不远  原子动力航空装置已经试飞正在改进

    超速环球飞行将是平常事
    苏联原子飞机升空为期不远
    原子动力航空装置已经试飞正在改进
    新华社莫斯科26日电　苏联近卫军上校华尔华洛夫最近在苏联“少年技术家”杂志上发表文章说，苏联的原子动力航空装置已经进行了首次飞行试验，经过进一步研究，第一批原子飞机飞到空中去已经为期不远了。将来超速不着陆的环球飞行将成为寻常之事。原子发动机将把人带到同温层的最高层，并且将为通向宇宙铺平道路。
    这篇题为“明日的航空事业”的文章指出，原子航空装置反应堆中核分裂射出大批粒子的动能变成热能，可以产生数千度的高温，用它来加热液体和气体，就获得大量的高热气体。这些气体从喷管里喷出，就可以像现代喷气式飞机喷管一样推动飞行装置飞速前进。
    为了使飞机场上的人员和飞机场本身免受放射性辐射的侵害，原子飞机上准备装一种原子和普通喷气装备并用的联合动力装备。飞机起飞和上升时使用普通喷气式发动机，一般飞行的时候就使用原子发动机。原子飞机的飞行速度可以通过反应堆的温度或喷管的横截面的变化来测定。
    华尔华洛夫在谈到原子能飞机可能的式样时说：为了使旅客免受放射性辐射的侵害，飞机的外形将是很长的，在飞机上还将设有一种特制的生物保护装置。
    不久以前，一般还认为，七万五千马力的原子发动机需要重约六十吨的隔板。但是经过科学家和工程师的研究，认为可以大大减少保护设备的重量。这样一来，在重一百多吨的重型飞机上的原子发动机的设备问题就不难解决了。
    原子飞机的机身可以用耐高温的材料——钛、镍和其他合金来制造。原子飞机和动力装置的操纵应当最大限度的自动化。
    华尔华洛夫说：原子飞机需要燃料很少，可以一圈又一圈地作不着陆的环球飞行。飞机上的乘客需要下飞机的时候，必先改乘另一架小飞机，由小飞机把他们降落到地面上，如果要从地面上到达正在天空绕行的原子飞机上则必须先乘一架小飞机，俟这架小飞机靠近原子飞机时，新乘客就可穿过一个特制的舱，到原子飞机的舱内找到座位。
