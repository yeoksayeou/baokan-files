Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In the past week's unrestrained airing of views, the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Trade have focused on exposing the unreasonable phenomena of bloated organization and overstaffing, and have launched a heated discussion on how to reform the organization.

Among the opinions on organizational problems raised by the staff of the Ministry, many criticized the phenomenon of overlapping organizational structures. For example, in charge of the import of machinery, there are two companies: the Machinery Import Company and the Transportation Machinery Import Company. Initially, it was determined that the Machinery Import Company would handle "heavy machinery," and the Transportation Machinery Import Company would handle transportation machinery. However, several years of practical work have shown that it is impossible to divide the work so clearly. In addition to handling heavy machinery, the Machinery Company also handles a variety of small tools, and the Transportation Machinery Company also handles food, textile, and other machinery. Because the division of labor between the two companies is not clear, they often pass the buck in their work, resulting in losses of manpower and materials. Many overlaps and contradictions also exist in the work of the Transportation Bureau and the Transportation Company. The internal organization and division of labor within each company also often involve mutual cross-cutting and unclear situations. For example, the China Minerals Company has one section in charge of sources of goods, the second section is responsible for trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and the third section is responsible for trade with capitalist countries. One type of commodity is divided into three parts, resulting in duplicated work, and sometimes when problems arise, they pass the buck to each other.

Staff members also sharply criticized phenomena such as overlapping layers and overstaffing. The administrative office group of the China Sundries Company exposed that the company had too many managers and section chiefs. Because there are many managers and deputy managers, a document or a matter is circulated or consulted several times, which prolongs the processing time. Four cadres of the China Minerals Company exposed the company's leadership's erroneous practice of blindly adding personnel. At the beginning of 1956, the company already had 157 people, and at that time it felt that there were too many people and prepared to streamline. Originally, the transfer of 30 people was approved, but only 17 were transferred. However, by the third quarter of last year, more people were added. In addition to the manager personally requesting six cadres from other places, 19 people were also requested from the Labor Bureau. Now the entire company has increased to 203 people, but another manager also requested 20 people from the Foreign Trade Training Class, preparing to add more people. Many employees of the Silk Company wrote big-character posters exposing a typical incident of setting up a position for a person. Last year, in order to take care of a cadre, the company leadership hired his wife. Now that this person does not have suitable work to do, she is asked to tear down old envelopes every day, which is said to save new envelopes. However, her monthly salary is more than 30 yuan. Even if the entire company uses new envelopes every month, it would not cost that much money. The employees asked, "Is this saving or waste?"

The staff not only exposed the above problems, but also carefully calculated the workload, and proposed plans for reforming the organization and the number of people that could be streamlined. Some company employees proposed three, four, or even seven or eight plans, and launched debates. The employees of the China Tea Export Company launched a debate on the organizational structure of the China Tea Export Company headquarters and proposed eight plans. The Sundries Export Company launched a discussion on whether to set up offices by commodity or by country, and whether import and export work should be combined. Many cadres of the Machinery Import Company and the Transportation Machinery Import Company suggested merging the two companies. They also put forward a plan on how to merge them. According to their preliminary calculations, the merger of the two companies could streamline 256 people, accounting for 44.83% of the current total number of employees in the two companies. The number of people that many companies requested to streamline exceeded the leadership's estimate. The Native Produce Export Company currently has 240 people, and the leadership initially estimated that about 60 to 70 people could be streamlined, but the masses requested that more than 80 or even 100 people be streamlined. The employees also launched mutual criticism against the conservative thinking in streamlining personnel. The pharmaceutical section of the Native Produce Export Company originally had 16 people. This time, they proposed to reduce only one person. The employees of the Native Produce Section criticized them for reducing too few. A cadre criticized this conservative phenomenon. The reason for his criticism was that the commodities of the pharmaceutical section are at the port, and they themselves do not control the commodities; he often sees cadres of the pharmaceutical section reading newspapers when they have nothing to do, so why can only one person be reduced!

At present, the Party Group of the Ministry of Foreign Trade has absorbed the opinions of the masses and put forward a plan for reforming the organization, which will be gradually handed over to the masses for discussion. In conjunction with the discussion on streamlining the organization, some Party members, Communist Youth League members, and the masses have begun to post big-character posters requesting to go to the countryside to participate in physical labor, temper themselves, and transform themselves.

### 外贸部机构臃肿人浮于事  接受群众批评提出改革机构方案

    外贸部机构臃肿人浮于事
    接受群众批评提出改革机构方案
    新华社讯　对外贸易部的工作人员在最近一周的大鸣大放中，集中地揭发了机构臃肿、人浮于事的不合理现象，对如何改革机构问题展开了热烈讨论。
    这个部的工作人员对机构问题提出的意见中，不少是批评机构设置重复的现象，如主管机械进口这项业务，就有机械进口和运输机械进口两个公司。最初确定机械进口公司是经营“重型机械”，运输机械进口公司是经营运输机械，但是几年来实际工作说明不可能分得这样清楚，机械公司除经营重型机械以外还经营多种细小的工具，运输机械公司也经营食品、纺织等机械，由于两个公司分工不清，工作中经常相互扯皮，以至造成人力物力的损失。运输局和运输公司工作中也存在许多重复和矛盾。各公司内部组织分工也常常发生互相交叉牵扯不清的现象。如中国矿产公司是一处管货源，二处负责对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易，三处负责对资本主义国家的贸易，一个品种分成三部分，工作重复，有时发生问题时便互相推诿。
    工作人员还对层次重叠，人浮于事等现象进行了尖锐的批评。中国杂品公司行政处小组揭发了该公司的经理、处长过多，由于经理、副经理多，一件文件或一件事几经传阅或洽商，延长了处理时间。中国矿产公司四个干部揭发了这个公司领导上盲目增添人员的错误作法。这个公司在1956年初已有人员一百五十七人，当时就感到人多，准备紧缩，原来批准调走的三十人，结果只调走了十七个，但到去年第三季度又添了人。除了经理亲自到外地要来了六个干部以外，还向劳动局要来了十九人，现在全公司已增加到二百零三人，但是另一位经理还向外贸专修班要了二十人，准备再加人。丝绸公司许多职工写大字报揭发一件因人设事的典型事件。去年公司领导上为照顾一个干部，把他的爱人录用下来，现在这人没有合适的工作做，就叫她每天拆旧信封，据说这样可以节约新信封，但是她每月的薪金是三十多元，即使全公司每月都用新信封也用不了这么多钱，职工们问，“这究竟是节约呢还是浪费呢？”
    工作人员们不仅揭发了上述问题，而且认真地计算工作量，提出了改革机构的方案和可以紧缩的人数，有的公司职工提出了三、四种甚至七、八种方案，并且展开了辩论。中国茶叶出口公司的职工们就茶叶出口公司总公司的机构问题上展开了争论，提出了八个方案。杂品出口公司对按商品设处还是按国别设处以及进出口工作是否合一的问题展开了讨论。机械进口公司和运输机械进口公司不少干部建议把这两个公司合并，他们还提出了如何合并的方案，按照他们的初步计算，两个公司合并后可以紧缩二百五十六人，占目前两公司总人数的44．83％。许多公司群众要求紧缩的人数超过了领导上的估计，土产出口公司现有二百四十人，领导上最初估计约可紧缩六十人至七十人，但是群众要求紧缩八十多人甚至一百人。对于紧缩人员中的保守思想，职工们也展开了相互批评。土产出口公司药材处原有十六人，这次他们提出只能减一人，土产处的职工批评他们减得太少了。一位干部批评了这种保守现象，他批评的理由是药材处的商品在口岸，本身并不掌握商品；经常看到药材处干部没事看报纸，为什么只能减少一人呢！
    目前对外贸易部的党组已经吸收群众意见提出了一个改革机构的方案将逐步交给群众讨论。结合讨论紧缩机构，一部分党员和共青团员和群众已开始贴出大字报要求到农村中去参加体力劳动，锻炼和改造自己。
