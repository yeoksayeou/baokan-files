    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region’s Greater Khingan Range Oroqen mountainous area and remote pastoral areas have recently established more than thirty new film projection teams. Up to now, every banner, county, and city in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has a film projection team. There are a total of one hundred and ninety film projection teams in the region, carrying more than two hundred films, including more than forty Mongolian-language films such as "Dong Cunrui," "Plains Guerrillas," and "The Blooming of Malanhua." These film teams often move around rural areas, pastoral areas, and the Greater Khingan Range forest area for screenings. Now, even herdsmen living on the vast grasslands can see a movie once every two months.
    This year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also established ten film clubs in some small and medium-sized towns in pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. Four cinemas have been established in Baotou, Hohhot, and other places. (Xinhua News Agency)

    内蒙古各旗县都有电影放映队
    内蒙古自治区大兴安岭鄂伦春山区和偏僻牧区最近新建立了三十多个电影放映队。到现在为止，内蒙古自治区每个旗、县、市都有了电影放映队。全区共有电影放映队一百九十个，携有影片二百多部，其中有蒙古语影片“董存瑞”、“平原游击队”和“马兰花开”等四十多部。这些电影队经常在农村、牧区和大兴安岭林区流动放映。现在就连居住在辽阔的草原上的牧民，也能每隔两个月看到一次电影。
