Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th: US Defense Secretary McElroy said at his first press conference on the 15th after taking office that the United States was "clearly behind the Russians" in the development of missiles and satellites. He said, "He cannot say how long it will take for the United States to catch up."

McElroy said that he would appoint a person in charge to manage the satellite and military applications of outer space tools program separately, in order to accelerate the development of future weapons and avoid disputes between the various military services. He said that the United States must expand its missile program and urgently needs to prioritize the development of new weapons.

McElroy also said that the United States intends to resolve the issue of establishing US missile launch bases in the "allied" countries of the European continent at the NATO meeting next month.

    美国新国防部长上任第一炮
    承认科学落后借机高喊扩军
    新华社16日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国防部长麦克艾罗伊15日在他任职后第一次举行的记者招待会上说，美国在导弹和卫星发展方面，“显然已经落在俄国人的后面了”。他说，“他现在还说不上美国需要多久的时间才能赶上”。
    麦克艾罗伊说，他将任命一个负责人来单独管理卫星及在军事上采用外层空间工具的计划，为的是加速今后武器的发展以及避免各军种之间的争执。他说，美国必须扩大它的导弹计划，迫切需要优先发展新型武器。
    麦克艾罗伊还说，美国打算在下月的北大西洋公约组织会议上解决在欧洲大陆“盟国”建立美国的导弹发射基地问题。
