Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Electric Dispatch: The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently decided to transfer sixty-one cadres at or above the prefectural committee level from provincial and prefectural committee organs to lower levels to take on leadership roles at various levels, the majority of whom will serve as county party secretaries, in order to strengthen leadership over agricultural production. As a result, fifty-two counties across the province, accounting for over 61% of the province's total, now have first secretaries of the county party committee who are cadres at or above the prefectural committee level.

This batch of cadres sent to lower levels includes members of the provincial committee and cadres at the level of provincial department heads. A significant portion of them have served as county party secretaries for many years and possess relatively rich work experience.

Since the end of last year, Hunan Province has successively sent over 35,700 cadres to lower levels to strengthen grassroots forces. Among them, 5,000 cadres at or above the district level have primarily strengthened the leadership core at the township level; over 20,000 cadres have been sent to work in grassroots units, and around 9,000 cadres have returned to the production front. After being sent down, they generally actively participate in labor and perform well, playing a positive role in consolidating agricultural cooperatives and developing production.

    加强对农业生产的领导
    湖南一批高级干部下放
    新华社长沙电　中共湖南省委最近决定从省委、地委机关抽调六十一名地委级以上的干部下放担任各级领导工作，其中绝大部分将担任县委书记工作，以加强对农业生产的领导。这样，全省已有五十二个县，即占全省61％以上的县的县委第一书记，是由地委级以上的干部担任的。
    这批下放的干部中包括省委委员和省委部长级的干部等。他们中有很大一部分人曾担任过多年的县委书记，都有比较丰富的工作经验。
    湖南省自去年年底以来已先后下放了三万五千七百多名干部充实基层力量。其中有五千名区级以上的干部主要是加强了乡一级的领导核心；有二万多名干部下放到基层单位工作，九千名左右的干部回到了生产战线。他们下放后，一般都积极劳动，表现良好，对巩固农业社、发展生产起了积极作用。
