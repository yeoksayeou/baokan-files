	Red Autumn
	Zhang Bin
	Like a young girl drunk on wine: the radish's cheeks are red; the corn tassels are red; the sorghum's ears are red…

	A girl, yelling, emerges from the red clouds in a horse-drawn carriage. She flicks her whip, and even the tip of the whip is red.

	A gust of evening wind blows from beyond the sky, and in an instant, the fields are filled with intoxicating red colors…
	
	Dusk

	The sun, wearing red velvet pajamas, goes to sleep. The smoke from the rooftops changes from light blue to dark gray.

	A green-tailed rooster perches on the fence, gazing towards the entrance of the village.

	Gah-gah—the ducks, who went swimming in the stream, stick out their chests, swaying their fat buttocks as they return. Soon, little ponies chase after little calves, frolicking and running. Then, the rumbling of iron-wheeled carts, the crackling of whips, the heart-stirring laughter of young girls, the uneven singing of young men, and the children's affectionate calls collide and fight each other, swarming into the village. The air instantly steams with the fragrance of grain stalks, the sour smell of sweat, and an intoxicating sweet smell made up of many components…
	
	On the threshing ground
	
	The sorghum is red, red like vermilion; the millet is yellow, yellow like gold.

	Two white horses, like two white sails caught in a whirlpool, spin endlessly in the sea of vermilion and gold.

	A red-faced youth and a girl wearing a white headscarf, like two children flying kites, tighten the reins in their hands, raise their whips with red tassels, and ripples of obvious smiles emerge from the corners of their eyes and mouths, immersed in an inexplicable feeling that makes their hearts dizzy…
	
	Wedding

	Eighteen red peonies hang down on the chests of eighteen new people: like eighteen lowered shy faces; like eighteen red flames emanating from their chests.

	The women giggle and chat; the young men laugh and joke; the children stick out their mischievous faces from between the adults' legs…
	
	The gongs and drums sound, and the suona horn blows a heart-tickling tune. Ten pairs of young men and women dressed in red and green dance gracefully in front of the newlyweds, as if, in this instant, the most beautiful colors in the world, the most beautiful sounds in the universe, and the most beautiful emotions in the world all converge here, forming a focal point, illuminating this room brilliantly.
	
	Oh! Autumn. Oh! A red, ripe festival…

    红色的秋天
    张滨
    仿佛少女喝醉了酒：萝卜的脸蛋儿红了；玉米的缨子红了；高粱的穗子红了……
    姑娘吆喝着双套马车，从红色的云霞里冲出来，她虚晃了一下鞭子，鞭稍儿也红了。
    一阵晚风从天外吹来，瞬间，田野里挤满了醉人的红的颜色……
    黄昏
    太阳披着红绒的睡衣去睡了，屋顶上的炊烟由淡蓝变成了深灰。
    一只绿尾巴的公鸡蹲在篱笆上向村口眺望着。
    嘎—嘎—到小河里游泳的鸭子挺着胸脯、摇摆着肥大的屁股回来了。不一会儿，小马驹追赶着小牛仔撒着欢跑来了；接着，铁瓦车的辚辚声、鞭子的噼啪声、少女们摇撼人心的笑声、小伙子们参差不齐的歌声，以及孩子们撒娇似的呼喊声，互相冲撞着、撕打着，一窝蜂似的拥进了村子。空气里顿时蒸腾起谷草的香味、汗水的酸味以及一种由许多成分混合在一起的令人陶醉的甜滋滋的气味……
    碾谷场上
    高粱是红的，红得像朱砂；谷子是黄的，黄得像金子。
    两匹白马，像两片被漩涡裹住的白帆，在朱砂和金子的海里，无止境的旋转着。
    一个红脸膛的青年和一个裹白头巾的姑娘，像两个比赛风筝的孩子，拉紧手中的缰绳，举着带红缨的鞭子，从眼角、从嘴涡漾出显明的笑意，沉醉在一种莫名的使心儿晕眩的感觉里……
    婚　礼
    十八朵红牡丹垂挂在十八个新人的胸前：像十八个低垂的羞涩的面孔；像十八朵透出胸房的红的火焰。
    妇女们唧唧嘎嘎的笑着；小伙们嘻嘻哈哈的闹着；孩子们从大人的腿叉里钻出淘气的脸……
    锣鼓敲响了，唢呐吹出搔痒人心的调子，整整十对披红挂绿的少男少女，翩翩起舞在新人们的面前，仿佛，这一瞬间，世界上最美的颜色、宇宙间最美的声音、人间最美好的情感，统统汇集到这里，形成一个焦点，把这间屋子照耀得灿烂夺目。
    哦！秋天。哦！红色的、成熟的节日……
