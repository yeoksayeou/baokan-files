		Under the Exploitation of the Paris Police Department...
		In the corrupt and declining capitalist society, the phenomenon of man exploiting man is endless.
		The Paris "Combat" newspaper, in a report on September 15th, exposed the reality of the cruel exploitation of the porters of the Paris "Central Market" by the Paris Police Department.
		The porters of the Paris "Central Market" are directly controlled by the Paris Police Department. Due to the large number of unemployed workers, job seekers flock in, and the regulations of the Police Department regarding the application conditions for porters at the "Central Market" are extremely harsh. First, applicants must be married and have a family. Second, applicants must never have violated police regulations. The Paris Police Department also conducts three examinations for applicants: First, applicants must carry a basket of paving stones as high as a person and weighing 200 kilograms, and walk a distance of 60 meters. If they don't change their expression, they pass. This exam costs 100 francs. The second exam is dictation, costing 20 francs. The third exam is answering questions, which also costs 20 francs. The total cost of the three exams is 140 francs. Based on past experience, about 350 out of every 1,000 applicants can pass the first exam, but after the elimination through dictation and answering questions, only 30 to 40 are selected.
		For four years, the Paris Police Department has been using the excuse that the "Central Market" is too small and has not "recruited" porters. The original 700 porters have now been reduced to 546. However, the work has increased a lot, and the exploitation of the porters has become more and more serious.
		In the past, there was an unwritten rule for the porters of the "Central Market" that young and strong porters would undertake more strenuous portering work, such as loading and unloading meat, while older people could engage in lighter vegetable portering work. However, due to the increased workload and reduced number of people, this unwritten rule has long been abolished.
		According to regulations, porters who reach the age of 54 should retire. However, porters are forced by life to disregard this regulation. Many elderly porters are still doing heavy work, and work-related injuries occur frequently, but the Paris Police Department turns a blind eye.
		The porters of the "Central Market" nominally work seven hours a day, but in reality, they have almost no time to rest. Because in addition to portering and loading and unloading, porters are responsible for the safekeeping of goods that have not yet been unloaded at the market. If there is a theft, they must compensate at the price. "Combat" newspaper said that because hooligans and thieves have no fixed office hours, the working hours of porters are sometimes 24 hours a day. (Lè Shān)

### 在巴黎警察厅的剥削下……

    在巴黎警察厅的剥削下……
    在腐朽、没落的资本主义社会里，人剥削人的现象是层出不穷的。
      9月15日的巴黎“战斗报”在一篇报道里，暴露了巴黎“中央菜市场”搬运工人遭受巴黎警察厅残酷剥削的实况。
    巴黎“中央菜市场”的搬运工人是由巴黎警察厅直接控制的。由于失业工人众多，求职者纷至沓来，警察厅对“中央菜市场”搬运工人应征条件的规定极端苛刻。首先，应征者必须是结过婚的、有家小的人。其次，应征者必须从未违犯过警章。巴黎警察厅还对应征者进行三项考试：第一，应征者必须背负高及人身的一篓重达二百公斤的铺路石、行走六十公尺的距离，如果面不改色就算通过。此项考试收费一百法郎。第二项考试是听写，收费二十法郎。第三项考试是答问题，收费也是二十法郎。三项考试费用合计一百四十法郎。根据过去情况，每一千名应征者，约有三百五十名可以通过第一项考试，而经过听写、答问的淘汰，选上的不过只有三、四十人。
    四年以来，巴黎警察厅借口“中央菜市场”过于狭小，一直没有“招考”搬运工人。原有的七百名搬运工人，现在只剩下五百四十六名了。然而工作却增加了许多，搬运工人所受的剥削愈来愈严重。
    过去，“中央菜市场”的搬运工人还有一种不成文的规定，年青力壮的搬运工人担任比较繁重的搬运工作，例如肉类的装卸等等，年纪较大的可以从事比较轻省的蔬菜搬运工作。但是，由于工作加重、人数减少，现在，这种不成文的规定早已取消。
    按照规定，年达五十四岁的搬运工人应行退休。可是搬运工人迫于生活，无法遵守这项规定。许多年老的搬运工人仍旧干着重活，工伤事故时有所闻，而巴黎警察厅竟熟视无睹。
    “中央菜市场”的搬运工人，名义上每天工作七小时，然而实际上，他们几乎没有休息的时间。因为除了搬运、装卸工作以外，搬运工人对留在菜市场上还没有起卸完毕的货物负有保管的责任。如果失窃，照价赔偿。“战斗报”说，由于流氓小偷并无固定办公时间，搬运工人的工作时间有时竟是每日二十四小时。　（乐山）
