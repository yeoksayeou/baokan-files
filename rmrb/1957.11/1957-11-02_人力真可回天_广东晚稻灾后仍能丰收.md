    Human Power Can Truly Turn the Tide
    Guangdong's Late Rice Harvest Can Still Be Bountiful After Disaster
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 1st. Guangdong Province's 38 million mu of late rice is certain to have a bumper harvest. Hainan Island, where the late rice harvest has already begun, can increase production by 80 million jin; the western Zhanjiang region can increase production by about 100 million jin; the northern Shaoguan region will increase production by about 8%; and the counties in the Chao汕 plain, a well-known high-yield rice area in the east, also have generally better late rice growth than last year.
    In September of this year, Guangdong Province suffered from an extraordinarily strong typhoon and rainstorm of magnitude eight to nine, and more than 4 million mu of late rice in the Huiyang and Foshan regions were affected. After the typhoon, due to the strengthening of leadership by the Party and government, hundreds of thousands of farmers in the disaster-stricken areas drained water, washed seedlings, supported seedlings, and applied fertilizer in the late rice fields every day. Therefore, many of the affected late rice crops are now growing well. Although some have suffered reduced yields due to the disaster, more than 90% of the province's late rice crops are growing very well and will not affect the bumper harvest.

    人力真可回天
    广东晚稻灾后仍能丰收
    新华社广州1日电　广东省三千八百万亩晚稻丰收已成定局。已经开始收割晚稻的海南岛可增产八千万斤；西部湛江专区可增产一亿斤左右；北部韶关专区约增产8％；东部著名水稻高产区的潮汕平原各县，晚稻也普遍长得比去年好。
    今年9月间，广东省曾经遭受到八至九级特大台风和暴雨的侵袭，惠阳专区和佛山专区有四百多万亩晚稻受灾。台风过后，由于党政加强领导，受灾地区每天都有数十万农民在晚稻田里排水、洗苗、扶苗和加施肥料，因此不少受灾的晚稻现在也长得不错。虽然有的因灾歉收，但全省九成以上的晚稻都生长得很好，并不影响丰收。
