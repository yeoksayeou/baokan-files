Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today entitled "An Excellent Gift Commemorating the October Revolution," stating that the brilliant success of the second artificial satellite launch is the result of the comprehensive development of Soviet technology. Soviet scientists and technicians today offered the greatest gift to the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution.

The "Indian Express" commented today on the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite, saying: "No fact can touch the hearts of the world so deeply and eclipse America's military power, its vast material resources, and Dulles' dubious diplomatic achievements." The "Indian Times" said that the Soviet Union has gone further ahead of the United States in designing rockets and exploring outer space, and who has a "position of strength" is no longer a question.

The Bengali newspaper "Azad" said on the 4th that the reason why the United States has not been able to launch even a twenty-one-pound artificial satellite to date is not because American scientists are incapable, but because of the shortcomings of the capitalist social system itself. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet Union's successful launch of the artificial satellite is "a victory of socialism over capitalism."

The "Burma New Light of Rangoon" editorial stated that such achievements can only be achieved when the Soviet government and people give great encouragement to Soviet scientists. The editorial emphasized that such achievements cannot be achieved in turbulent and disunited countries.

The Lebanese "Al Shark" pointed out that after the Soviet Union launched the second Earth satellite carrying animals, American scientists have fallen into an embarrassing state.

The Israeli "People's Voice" wrote in an editorial that the news of the launch of the second artificial satellite once again proves that the Soviet Union has won the upper hand in the peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism in the field of science. Politicians and scientists in capitalist countries have also had to admit this." It also pointed out that when the first satellite was launched, the Cold War warriors tried to intimidate the people and demanded increased arms competition. However, ordinary people all over the world understand that the Soviet Union's great scientific victory is strengthening the possibility of peace.

London newspapers on November 4th published detailed articles by reporters and commentators on the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite with great length.

The "Daily Mail" wrote that the Soviet Union's new scientific victory "is incredible and exciting." The "Daily Express" science commentator Pincher emphasized that the news of the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite "deeply shocked" the British military leaders. He believes that the Soviet Union must have a new type of rocket fuel that is better than anything the West has. Pincher wrote that Soviet scientists have apparently solved the problem of long-distance control of large rockets, a problem that all Britons and Americans have struggled to solve. "The Western Mail and South Wales News" also said in an editorial that, according to some cautious experts, the Soviet Union has solved problems that the West can only solve in five to ten years.

    苏联的新月照亮了人们的眼睛
    许多人看清社会主义优越资本主义腐朽
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：越南“人民报”今天以“纪念十月革命的出色礼物”为题发表社论说，第二颗人造卫星发射的辉煌成功是苏联技术全面发展的结果。苏联科学技术人员今天以最出色的礼物献给伟大的十月革命四十周年。
      “印度快报”今天评论苏联发射第二颗人造卫星说：“没有任何一个事实能够那样打动世界的心弦，并且使美国的军事力量、它的巨大的物质资源以及杜勒斯在外交上的可疑的成绩失去光彩。”“印度时报”说，苏联在设计火箭和开拓外层空间方面已经更远地走在美国前面，谁有“实力地位”已经不成为问题了。
    孟加拉文日报“自由报”4日说，美国迄今甚至还不能发射一颗二十一磅重的人造卫星的原因并不在于美国科学家不行，而是在于资本主义社会制度本身的缺点。这家报纸指出，苏联发射人造卫星成功是“社会主义对资本主义的胜利”。
    仰光“缅甸新光报”的社论说，只有在苏联政府和人民对苏联科学家给予巨大的鼓励的情况下才能获得这样的成就。社论着重指出，在动荡不安、不团结的国家里是不能获得这样的成就的。
    黎巴嫩“东方报”指出，在苏联发射了装着动物的第二颗地球卫星以后，美国科学家已经陷入狼狈不堪的状态。
    以色列“人民呼声报”在社论中写道，第二颗人造卫星发射的消息再一次证明，社会主义和资本主义在科学领域的和平竞赛中苏联获得了优胜。资本主义国家的政治家和科学家也不得不承认这一点”。它还指出，还在第一个卫星发射的时候，冷战武士们就企图恫吓人民，并且要求加强军备竞争。但是，全世界各地普通的人们都理解，苏联的伟大科学胜利正在加强和平的可能性。
    伦敦各报11月4日以很大篇幅登载了记者和评论员撰写的关于苏联发射第二颗人造卫星的详细文章。
    “每日邮报”写道，苏联科学的新的胜利“是难以置信和激动人心的”。“每日快报”科学评论员平彻尔强调指出，苏联发射第二颗人造卫星的新闻“深深地震动了”英国的军事领袖。他认为，苏联一定有一种新式的火箭燃料，这种燃料比西方现有的一切燃料都要好。平彻尔写道，苏联科学家显然解决了远距离操纵大型火箭的问题，解决了一切英国人和美国人苦于不能解决的问题。“西方邮报与南威尔士新闻”在编辑部文章中也说，根据一些谨慎的专家们的看法，苏联解决了西方只能在五年到十年之后才能解决的问题。
