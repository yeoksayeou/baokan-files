Comrades, friends:

    Today, the great Soviet people are jubilantly celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. The Chinese people and all progressive mankind around the world are also celebrating this glorious festival, which marks a fundamental turning point in human history, with equal joy. Now, all circles in our capital are holding a rally here to celebrate this great and glorious festival.

    Invited to participate in our capital's rally celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution today are the ambassadors of various countries to China and Soviet expert comrades in Beijing, as well as other distinguished guests. Originally, the Soviet delegation from all walks of life, headed by Comrade Andreyev, participating in the Chinese people's celebration of the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, who came from afar, should also be here. However, due to weather conditions, they will not arrive until tomorrow. We express our warm welcome and gratitude to them.

    Today, the great significance of the October Revolution is becoming increasingly clear and is recognized by the broad masses of working people. On the fourth anniversary of the October Revolution, the great Lenin once said: "The farther away we are from this great day of November 7, 1917, the more obvious the significance of the Russian proletarian revolution becomes." His words feel particularly close to us now.

    For forty years, the great achievements of the Soviet people and the great achievements of the world's cause of peace, democracy, and socialism have all started from the October Revolution. The light of the October Revolution illuminates the path of liberation for the exploited people and oppressed nations all over the world. As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, we can more clearly look forward to the greater and newer achievements of the Soviet people and aspire to the prosperous and happy future of human society.

    We congratulate the Soviet people on the great victory they have achieved in economic and cultural construction. This victory has strengthened the forces of peace and democracy throughout the world and encouraged the courage of working people all over the world to build a new life.

    We congratulate the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and people on the great victory they have achieved in the cause of defending world peace. This victory has severely hit the shameful conspiracies of the war instigators headed by US imperialism, united the peace-loving people all over the world, and made the people deeply believe that peace can defeat war.

    We congratulate the unity and strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This camp is a great fortress for defending world peace, maintaining international justice, and supporting the cause of human progress.

    We congratulate the development of the unbreakable and profound friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The close unity of the people of these two great socialist countries, which includes more than 800 million people, is a powerful guarantee for the inevitable victory of the cause of world peace and progress.

    在北京庆祝十月革命四十周年大会上
    彭真市长的开幕词同志们，朋友们：
    今天，伟大的苏联人民正在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年。中国人民和全世界进步人类，也在以同样欢欣的心情，庆祝这个标志着人类历史根本转变的光辉节日。现在我们首都各界在这里举行大会庆祝这个伟大的光辉的节日。
    今天应邀参加我们首都各界庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年大会的，有各国驻我国的使节和在京的苏联专家同志们和其他贵宾们，本来还有远道而来的以安德烈耶夫同志为首的苏联各界参加中国人民庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念的代表团，因为气候关系，明日才能赶来。我们对他们表示热烈的欢迎和感谢。
    现在，十月革命的伟大意义，是越来越明显，并且为广大劳动人民所认识了。在十月革命第四周年的时候，伟大的列宁曾经这样说过：1917年11月7日，“这个伟大的日子离开我们愈远，俄国无产阶级革命的意义就愈明显”。他的这句话，现在特别使我们感到亲切。
    四十年来，苏联人民的伟大成就，全世界和平、民主和社会主义事业的伟大成就，都是从十月革命开始的。十月革命的光芒照耀着全世界被剥削人民和被压迫民族的解放道路。当我们庆祝十月革命四十周年的时候，使我们更加清楚地展望到苏联人民的更大更新的成就，向往着人类社会的繁荣幸福的未来。
    我们祝贺苏联人民在经济和文化建设事业中所取得的伟大胜利。这个胜利，增强了全世界和平民主的力量，鼓舞了全世界劳动人民，建设新生活的勇气。
    我们祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的国家和人民在保卫世界和平的事业中所取得的伟大胜利。这个胜利，严重地打击了以美帝国主义为首的战争挑拨者的可耻阴谋，团结了全世界爱好和平的人民，使人民深信和平可以战胜战争。
    我们祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和强盛。这个阵营是捍卫世界和平、维护国际正义、支持人类进步事业的伟大堡垒。
    我们祝贺中苏两国的牢不可破的深厚友谊的发展。这个包括了八亿以上人口的两国人民的伟大社会主义国家的亲密团结，是世界和平进步事业必然胜利的强大保证。
