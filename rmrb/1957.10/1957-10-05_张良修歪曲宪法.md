    Zhang Liangxiu Distorts the Constitution

    Zhang Liangxiu, a professor at Zhongshan University, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), and a rightist element who styles himself as a "national law expert," in order to achieve his political goal of opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism, unscrupulously distorted the spirit of the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China," selectively quoting constitutional provisions to negate the Party's leadership over the country, which has long been recognized by all the people. He said, "Since the Communist Party came to power, the relationship between the Party and the people has been one of ruler and ruled." He openly clamored for the "reasonable" society in his mind to "stand up" and the "unreasonable" society to "fall down"! This Zhang Liangxiu, who became a traitor after the failure of the Great Revolution, has always relied on the Kuomintang. In his so-called "Constitutional Road," he praised Chiang Kai-shek for his "great personality" and said that Hitler died for his country, and his "dignified" personality should not be insulted.

    Currently, everyone is criticizing his reactionary words and deeds.

    张良修歪曲宪法
    以“国家法专家”自命的中山大学教授、民革成员右派分子张良修，为了达到反对共产党、反对社会主义的政治目的，不惜歪曲“中华人民共和国宪法”的精神，断章取义地援引宪法条文，否定全民早就公认党对国家的领导权。说“共产党执政以来，党和人民的关系是统治与被统治的关系”，他公开叫嚣要他心目中“合理的”社会“站起来”，“不合理”的社会“倒下去”！这个在大革命失败后就成了叛徒的张良修，一直投靠国民党，在他写的一本所谓“宪政之路”里，就歌颂蒋介石“人格伟大”，希特勒是以身殉国，“庄严”人格是不可侮的。
    目前大家正批判他的反动言行。
