Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 13th: A large number of poems, letters, and artistic works congratulating the early completion of the Yangtze River Bridge have been sent to Wuhan from all over the country.

These poems, letters, and artistic works were sent either to the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, the Preparatory Committee for the Completion and Opening of the Yangtze River Bridge, or to the editorial departments of Wuhan newspapers. In the past ten days or so, the number of related poems and letters has exceeded one thousand.

People are using different methods to express their unparalleled joy. An old man of seventy-five from Xinzhou Town, Lixian County, Hunan Province, wrote in a letter that after hearing the news of the early completion of the Yangtze River Bridge, he could not restrain his inner excitement and wrote a song, a couplet, and six ancient poems in succession. One of the poems he sent reads: "Wuhan's Tortoise and Snake Mountains lock the great river, a bridge spans the great divide, an unprecedented feat; the Chinese people rejoice with wild abandon." Ling Yanbin of Guangzhou No. 5 Middle School sent a congratulatory message of "The First Bridge Across the Ten-Thousand-Li Yangtze River" on the same day the news of the bridge's completion was published in the newspaper. However, after sending it, he felt that his emotions had not been fully expressed, so he wrote another congratulatory message. The Young Pioneers of Taolimin Elementary School in Inner Mongolia personally embroidered a dazzling brocade banner with a model of the bridge. The upper end of the banner was also embroidered with the words "Celebrating the Completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge" in bright red letters. In their letter, they said that they wanted to send it to the "bridge-building uncles."

Many people also used the construction achievements of the Yangtze River Bridge as an example in their letters to refute the bourgeois rightists. Niu Peitian, a worker from Xinxiang City, Henan Province, said: Before liberation, under the rule of the Kuomintang, the people could only sigh at the river. After liberation, the Yangtze River Bridge was completed in just a few years. He said: "The rightists want to obliterate the achievements of socialist construction under the leadership of the Communist Party, saying that the achievements are not the main thing. Then let them come and see the Yangtze River Bridge!"

### “一桥飞架破天荒　中国人民喜若狂”  全国欢庆长江大桥建成

    “一桥飞架破天荒　中国人民喜若狂”
    全国欢庆长江大桥建成
    新华社武汉13日电　大批祝贺长江大桥提前建成的诗篇、信件和艺术作品从全国各地寄来武汉。
    这些诗篇、信件和艺术作品，有的寄给武汉长江大桥工程局，有的寄给长江大桥落成通车筹备委员会，还有的寄给武汉的报纸编辑部。十多天来，有关诗篇和信件已达千件以上。
    人们采用不同的方法来表达自己无比欢欣的心情。湖南省澧县新洲镇一个七十五岁的老人来信说，他听到长江大桥提前建成的消息以后，抑制不住内心的兴奋，接连写了一首歌、一副对联、六首古诗。他寄来的诗中有一首写道：“武汉龟蛇锁大江，一桥飞架破天荒；史无前例创宏举，中国人民喜若狂。”广州市第五中学凌彦宾在报纸公布大桥建成消息的当天，就寄来了“万里长江第一桥”的祝词。但是他寄出以后感到自己的感情还没有充分表达出来，接着又另写来一首祝词。内蒙古桃力民小学的少先队员们，亲手赶绣了一面光彩夺目的有大桥模型的锦旗，旗的上端还绣着“庆祝武汉长江大桥建设竣工”几个大红字。他们在来信中说，要把它送给“修桥叔叔们”。
    许多人在来信中还以长江大桥的建设成就为例，驳斥了资产阶级右派分子。河南省新乡市工人牛培田说：在解放前国民党统治时期，人民只能望江兴叹，解放后短短几年长江大桥就建成了。他说：“右派分子想抹煞共产党领导的社会主义建设成就，说成绩不是主要的，那就请他们来看长江大桥吧！”
