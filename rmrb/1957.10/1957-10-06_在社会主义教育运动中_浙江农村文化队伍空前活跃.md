    In the Socialist Education Movement,
    Zhejiang's Rural Cultural Teams are Unprecedentedly Active
    (Our report) To vigorously launch the socialist education movement in rural areas, the CCP Lanxi County Committee decided to strengthen leadership over this movement. The "Socialist Propaganda and Education Movement Committee" was formed by the county committee, culture section, Communist Youth League committee, trade union, women's federation, military unit, and industry and commerce federation. Branches were established in each district, and groups were established in each township to lead the socialist education movement. The Propaganda Department of the County Committee also convened a propaganda meeting attended by propaganda cadres from the county's Party members, rural club directors, rural theater troupe leaders, and district and township propaganda departments. The Lanxi County People's Committee also selected some government staff, workers, and junior high school graduates to organize a "Socialist Touring Performance Team" to tour the county and guide rural clubs, libraries, theater troupes, and cultural stations, mobilizing all rural cultural propaganda teams to launch a vigorous socialist education movement. Counties such as Xiaoshan and Yongkang also mobilized cultural propaganda teams to organize "Socialist Propaganda Teams," small-scale physical exhibitions, and picture exhibitions.
    In order to closely cooperate with the socialist education movement, cultural teams in various places fully utilized various propaganda tools and invested in the socialist education movement. The Suichang County Cultural Center held a small-scale physical exhibition, with exhibits including old cotton-padded clothes worn by farmers in the past and statistical charts. One chart showed that in Fengshulong Village, only one household lived in a tile-roofed house before liberation, and now all 13 households in the village live in tile-roofed houses. Before liberation, four households in the village had no rice to celebrate the New Year, and now they not only have enough to eat but also sell more than 10,000 catties of grain to the state. The Second Film Team of Jiande County, in order to cooperate with the local grain issue debate, used local examples, through recollection, comparison, and detailed accounting methods, compiled the "The Stars in the Sky Cannot be Counted, the Benefits of Unified Purchase and Sale Cannot be Exhausted" lantern slide crosstalk, which played a significant role in the debate. The Yongkang County Cultural Center organized artists with strong creative abilities to create a "Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain is Really Good" storytelling material and organized many artists to tour various townships and communes. The Tonglu County Culture and Education Section, Cultural Center, Science Popularization Association, and other units organized a socialist propaganda team, carrying more than ten sets of lantern slides and nine sets of color pictures such as "Is the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain Good?", "Is Cooperativization Good?", and "Resolutely Take the Road of Cooperativization" to the countryside for propaganda. Socialist propaganda teams in Pinghu, Wenling, Tangxi, and other counties also used a variety of propaganda and education forms, such as crosstalk, storytelling, quick talk, rhythmic storytelling, big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, and cartoons, to carry out rural socialist education.
    Through the vigorous socialist education conducted in various counties, many farmers deeply realized the suffering of the old society and the happy life of the new society after visiting small-scale physical exhibitions. Socialist righteousness was established in the countryside, and the awareness of the masses was raised.

    在社会主义教育运动中
    浙江农村文化队伍空前活跃
    本报讯　浙江省兰溪、萧山、定海、平湖、遂昌、建德、温岭、桐庐、永康和汤溪等县文化队伍在各地党委的领导下，积极投入社会主义教育运动。
    为了在农村大张旗鼓地开展社会主义教育运动，中共兰溪县委决定加强对这一运动的领导，由县委、文化科、团委、工会、妇联、部队、工商联等单位成立了“社会主义宣传教育运动委员会”，各区成立分会，各乡成立小组领导社会主义教育运动。县委宣传部还召开了全县党的宣传员、农村俱乐部主任、农村剧团团长、区乡宣传部干部参加的宣传会议。兰溪县人民委员会还抽调一部分政府工作人员、工人、初中毕业生组织“社会主义巡回演出队”，在全县巡回演出，并辅导农村俱乐部、图书室、剧团、文化站，把农村一切文化宣传队带动起来，展开一次轰轰烈烈的社会主义教育运动。萧山、永康等县也分别发动文化宣传队伍，组织“社会主义宣传队”、小型实物展览会、图片展览会。
    为了紧密配合社会主义教育运动，各地文化队伍把各种宣传工具充分运用起来，投入社会主义教育运动。遂昌县文化馆举办小型实物展览，展品有农民过去穿的破棉袄等实物和统计图表。有一个图表表明，枫树垅村有十四户人家，在解放前只有一户住瓦房，现在全村已有十三户住上瓦房。解放前全村有四户无米过年，现在不仅吃不了，还卖给国家一万多斤粮食。建德县第二电影队为配合当地粮食问题的辩论，运用当地实例，通过回忆、对比、算细账的方法，编绘了“天上星星数不清，统购统销的好处说不尽”的幻灯相声，对辩论会起了很大作用。永康县文化馆组织创作能力较强的艺人，创作了“粮食统购统销实在好”的说唱材料，并组织许多艺人到各乡社巡回演出。桐庐县文教科、文化馆、科普协会等单位组织社会主义宣传队，带着“粮食统购统销好不好”，“合作化好不好”，“坚决走合作化道路”等幻灯片十余套和九套彩色图片到农村宣传。平湖、温岭、汤溪等县社会主义宣传队还运用相声、说唱、快板、数来宝、大字报、黑板报和漫画等多种多样的宣传教育形式，开展农村社会主义教育。
    各县农村进行了大张旗鼓的社会主义教育，许多农民在参观小型实物展览以后，都深深地体会到旧社会的痛苦和新社会的幸福生活。农村树立了社会主义正气，广大群众认识有了提高。
