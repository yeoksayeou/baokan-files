　　Counterattack Capitalist Spontaneous Forces and Further Strengthen Market Management
    Shanghai Comprehensively Investigates and Handles Spontaneous Industrial Households
    (Our Newspaper News) After the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee decided to comprehensively investigate and handle spontaneous industrial households, districts such as Yimiao, Penglai, and Xuhui successively launched this work from August, gaining preliminary experience. In Yimiao District alone, 589 households violating the law have been shut down, with three households having extremely serious violations and already transferred to judicial organs for punishment. Combined with the handling of spontaneous industrial households violating state laws, these districts conducted a universal propaganda and education campaign against capitalist spontaneous forces and outlawing speculative and illegal activities for all spontaneous industrial households, achieving good results. Now, Shanghai is about to comprehensively investigate and handle spontaneous industrial households throughout the city. The Liberation Daily published an editorial on the 9th, saying, "This is a struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road on the economic front, and also another important step in strengthening market management."
    Most of Shanghai's spontaneous industrial households developed last year during a period of relatively tight market commodity supply and frequent out-of-town purchases. Over the past year, although relevant departments have rectified and inspected, and shut down a number of illegal households, the number remains significant. These spontaneous industrial households mostly take advantage of some shortcomings in industrial and market management during the early stages of joint state-private ownership to engage in many improper and even illegal business activities. Their harm lies not only in extremely blind production, irresponsibility for quality, and complete disregard for leadership in price fluctuations, but also directly and indirectly affecting the production plans of state-owned and joint-owned industries, directly and indirectly hindering transformation, corrupting employees, and affecting the consolidation of joint ventures. Some private individuals participating in joint state-private enterprises or small owners participating in cooperatives not only engage in spontaneous industrial household activities themselves, but also lure and hire a group of employed workers and cooperative members to participate in spontaneous industrial households with high salaries and violence. Some are "doing socialism during the day and capitalism at night." Because of doing capitalism at night, they cannot help but be late and leave early during the day, increasing errors, substandard products, and even waste products, affecting the original production plans. Some private individuals and small owners collude with employees, are enthusiastic about engaging in spontaneous industrial households, and their own lives become corrupt and degenerate, which also affects some employed private individuals, employees, and cooperative members, to the point where a few confused people simply demand to leave their original enterprises to take the capitalist road. For example, Jiang Caihai, a private individual from the joint state-private Wuhua Paint Factory, colluded with and corrupted employees, and in the name of relatives and friends, planned to open spontaneous factories four times. Jiang Caihai also stole production materials from the joint state-private enterprise and dug up production tasks, causing the production of the joint state-private factory to decline, resulting in a loss of more than 1,000 yuan in July alone. Chen Junfang, a spontaneous industrial household engaged in bakelite electrical appliances, in order to obtain exorbitant profits, colluded with purchasing personnel from a joint state-private enterprise through bribery and secret partnerships, falsely reporting goods requisitioning plans and twice embezzling 600 catties of bakelite ash from the state.
    The Liberation Daily editorial pointed out: This is a small countercurrent of capitalism that has emerged in our economic life. Timely preventing this countercurrent of capitalism and comprehensively investigating and handling spontaneous industrial households will not only help consolidate state-owned and joint state-private enterprises and stabilize market order, but also help strengthen the socialist transformation of private individuals and improve the socialist consciousness of the broad working class.
    The editorial said: Capitalist spontaneous industrial households must be resolutely banned without any leniency. Anyone who is a private individual or small owner who seizes equipment, raw materials, or funds by means of deception and theft, digs up employed workers or cooperative members, or hires farmers to work in the city without authorization, or uses their position to solicit or transfer production tasks from state-owned or joint state-private enterprises, if they continue to persist in this practice despite advice, then it is a serious violation of the law. For these people, administrative sanctions and even legal penalties should be given according to the degree of repentance and the seriousness of the circumstances. Any employed worker or cooperative member who privately engages in this kind of spontaneous industrial household activity is showing ideological confusion, unstable stance, and inability to resist capitalist temptation. They should be quickly urged to abandon capitalist management and turn back as soon as possible through internal education within the trade union and the implementation of administrative discipline within the enterprise.
    The editorial, in view of the different situations of capitalist spontaneous industrial households, individual handicrafts and their spontaneous joint organizations, and family sideline occupations, put forward the principles of banning and retaining, and required differentiated handling according to the nature of spontaneous industrial households. The editorial also specifically pointed out: Judging from the preliminary experience of Yimiao and other districts, the investigation and handling of spontaneous industrial households is a complex and meticulous task, requiring ideological education, administrative management, and business measures to advance together, and must go through four "processes" of policy propaganda, organization debate, self-investigation and declaration, and batch processing, and simple and crude methods cannot be adopted.

### 反击资本主义自发势力　进一步加强市场管理  上海全面清查处理自发工业户

　　反击资本主义自发势力　进一步加强市场管理
    上海全面清查处理自发工业户
    本报讯　上海市人民委员会决定全面地清查处理自发工业户以后，邑庙、蓬莱、徐汇等区从8月份起，先后展开这一工作，取得了初步经验。仅邑庙区就已经取缔违法户五百八十九家；其中有三户违法情节十分严重，已经移送司法机关惩处。结合对违反国家法令的自发工业户的处理。这些区对全体自发工业户普遍进行了一次反对资本主义自发势力、取缔投机违法活动的宣传教育，已经收到了良好的效果。现在，上海市即将在全市范围内全面清查和处理自发工业户。解放日报在9日发表社论说：“这是经济战线上社会主义道路和资本主义道路的斗争，也是加强市场管理的又一重要步骤。”
    上海市的自发工业户，大部分是在去年下半年市场商品供应比较紧张、外埠采购比较频繁的情况下发展起来的。一年来，虽然经过有关部门整顿、检查，取缔了一批违法户，但是数量仍然不少。这种自发工业户大多利用公私合营初期有关部门在工业管理、市场管理上的一些缺点，从事许多不正当的以至违法的经营活动。它们的害处不仅在于生产极度盲目、对质量不负责任和价格涨落上完全不听领导，而且直接、间接地影响了国营、合营工业的生产计划，直接、间接地妨碍改造，腐蚀职工，影响合营企业的巩固。一部分参加公私合营企业的私方人员或参加合作社的小业主，不但自己从事自发工业户的活动，还以高薪、暴力去引诱、挖雇一批在业的职工和社员一起参加自发工业户。有的在“白天搞社会主义，晚上搞资本主义”，由于晚上搞资本主义，白天便不能不迟到早退、增加差错、增加副次品以至废品，影响了原定的生产计划。有的私方人员和小业主拉拢职工，热衷于搞自发工业户，自己生活腐化堕落，又影响了一些在业的私方人员、职工和社员，以至于有少数糊涂人干脆要求离开原企业去走它的资本主义之路。例如公私合营五合喷漆厂私方人员蒋才海拉拢和腐蚀职工，以亲友名义，先后策划开设自发工厂达四次之多。蒋才海还盗窃公私合营企业的生产资料，挖取生产任务，使公私合营厂生产下降，仅今年7月份就损失了一千多元。一个经营胶木电器的自发工业户陈君芳，为了获取暴利，竟以贿赂、暗中合伙等方式，勾结公私合营企业的进货人员，虚报要货计划，两次套购了国家六百市斤胶木灰。
    解放日报社论指出：这是在我们经济生活中出现的一小股资本主义逆流。及时地阻遏这股资本主义逆流，全面地清查和处理自发工业户，不仅有利于巩固国营和公私合营企业，稳定市场秩序，而且有利于加强对私方人员的社会主义改造，提高广大工人阶级的社会主义觉悟。
    社论说：必须坚决取缔资本主义性质的自发工业户，不应有丝毫姑息。凡是私方人员或小业主，用欺骗和盗窃方法攫取设备、原料、资金的，挖雇在业职工、社员或擅自招聘农民进城工作的，利用职权争揽或转移国营、公私合营企业的生产任务的，如果不听劝告继续坚持这种做法，那便是一种严重的违法行为。对于这些人，应该视其悔改程度及情节轻重给以行政处分以至法律惩处。凡是在业的职工或社员私自进行这种自发工业户活动的，这是一种思想糊涂、立场不稳、经不起资本主义诱惑的表现，应该通过工会内部的教育，和企业内部执行行政纪律的办法，迅速督促他们放弃资本主义经营，及早回头。
    社论针对资本主义性质的自发工业户、个体手工业及其自发的联合组织、家庭副业等不同情况，提出了取缔和保留的原则，要求根据自发工业户的性质等有区别地加以处理。社论还特别指出：从邑庙等区的初步经验来看，对于自发工业户的清查处理是一项复杂、细致的工作，需要思想教育、行政管理、业务措施三头并进，并且要经过政策宣传、组织辩论、自查申报、分批处理这四个“工序”，不能采取简单粗糙的做法。
