Debate Whatever You Do
    Yan Ling
    While the great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism is underway, in many places, another kind of debate has also emerged—debates in daily work, which can also be called "small debates." The great debate on the two roads is generally carried out in a planned, step-by-step, and systematic manner under the leadership and assistance of the work teams; the small debates on daily work are conducted by grassroots cadres and the masses in the manner of "debating whatever you do." This kind of small debate not only directly promotes work, but also, to a certain extent, improves the ideological level of cadres and the masses, and improves the work style of grassroots cadres.
    The Madi Zhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Jinghai County, Hebei Province, was supposed to sow 1,800 mu of wheat according to the plan. When 1,000 mu had been sown, many people said that the remaining land was too dry and could not be sown anymore. Could the plan be completed after all? Should it be completed? A small debate unfolded. Finally, it was clarified: in order to provide the country with enough wheat next year, and in order to eat more wheat ourselves next year, we must complete the wheat planting plan. Some people thought that we couldn't plant more because they didn't fully understand the superiority of the cooperative. The cooperative is strong and has a lot of dry land and the strength to water it; there is also land that can be planted without watering. Some experienced farmers immediately went to the fields to survey and indeed found about 500 mu of land that could be sown without watering. The cooperative cadres set up sheds and slept in the fields, and in a few days, they watered more than 1,000 mu of land. As a result, a total of 3,000 mu of wheat could be planted, greatly exceeding the plan. Because after the debate, everyone came up with ideas and everyone worked together, the cadres and the masses had the same ideas and worked with great enthusiasm. They also had a clearer understanding of the power of the collective.
    The Yuan Mengkou Agricultural Cooperative in this county conducted a debate specifically on the issue of assessing actual yields and reporting actual acreage when assessing autumn grain production. Cadres and the masses unified their thinking in the debate and reported to the government several hundred mu of land that had been concealed in the past (which could yield more than 190,000 jin of rice), and the relationship between cadres and the masses became closer.
    Many other places have also begun to use the method of debate in daily work. Should a canal be opened (is it worth spending more effort and money on this)? Should high-yield crops be grown instead? Should more public accumulation funds be retained? Should state loans be repaid on time? … When doing these tasks, the work was carried out more satisfactorily when debates were held in advance.
    This can already be used as a normal working method. It can be used frequently in places where large-scale debates have already been carried out, and it may also be implemented in places where large-scale debates have not yet been carried out. It can be implemented with the help of a work team, or it can be implemented only under the leadership of the rural branch. In various daily tasks, among cadres, among the masses, and between cadres and the masses, there are often different opinions, and sometimes disputes occur. However, there are also often different opinions without disputes, or each only discusses behind the back, without facing each other. As a result, either the work is done, but some knots are left in some people's hearts; or the progress of the work is slow, or even cannot be pushed forward; or there are indeed errors and shortcomings in the work arrangements, and it is only discovered in the middle or at the end that it is wrong, causing losses. All these situations can be easily avoided by bringing out the different opinions and debating them. What if the debate goes badly, it stalls, and fights break out? It should be believed that making the method of debate a common practice is precisely the fundamental way to avoid serious disputes.
    When any place can use this method in its daily work, then it can be said that a political situation in which there is both unity of will and personal ease of mind, both centralization and democracy, has been formed in that place.

    做什么就辩论什么
    燕凌
    当关于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论正在进行着的时候，在许多地方，也出现了另外一种辩论——日常工作中的辩论，也可以叫做“小辩论”。关于两条道路的大辩论，一般都是在工作组的领导帮助下有计划有步骤有系统地进行的；关于日常工作的小辩论，则是基层干部和群众以“做什么就辩论什么”的方式进行的。这种小辩论，不但直接推动了工作，也在一定程度上提高了干部和群众的思想水平，改进了基层干部的作风。
    河北静海县马帝庄农业社，按照计划应播种小麦一千八百亩。种到一千亩的时候，就有许多人说剩下的地都太旱，不能再种。计划究竟能不能完成？要不要完成？一场小辩论展开了。终于辨明了：为了明年供给国家足够的麦子，为了明年自己能吃更多的麦子，一定要完成种麦计划。有些人认为不能再多种了，那是因为没有充分了解合作社的优越性。合作社力量大，有大量的旱地也有力量浇；不用浇就可以种的地，也还有。一些有经验的农民立即出动到地里勘察，的确找出了不必浇就可以播种的五百来亩地。社干部到地里搭棚搭铺，在地里吃饭，在地里睡觉，不几天又浇地一千多亩。结果，总共能种麦三千亩，大大超过了计划。因为经过了辩论，大家出主意大家干，干部群众思想一致，干得特别起劲。对于集体的力量，也有了更清楚的认识。
    这个县的元蒙口农业社，在评定秋季粮食产量的时候，专就评实产量、报实亩数的问题进行了辩论。干部和群众在辩论中把思想统一了起来，向政府报出了过去隐瞒了的几百亩地（能收十九万多斤稻谷），干群关系也更密切了。
    别的许多地方也开始在日常工作中运用辩论的方法。要不要开渠（在这上面多费工多用钱值得不值得）？要不要改种高产作物？要不要多留公积金？要不要按期归还国家贷款？……在做这些工作的时候，事先经过辩论的，工作就都进行得比较圆满。
    这已经可以作为一种正常的工作方法来运用了。在已经开展过大辩论的地方可以经常运用它，在还没有开展过大辩论的地方也不妨实行。有工作组帮助可以实行，只在农村支部领导下也可以实行。在日常各种工作中，在干部中间，在群众中间，在干部和群众之间，本来就常有不同的意见，有时候也发生争论。但是，也往往有不同的意见而并不争论，或者各自只在背后议论，互不照面。其结果，或者是工作做了，而在一些人心里留下一些疙瘩；或者是工作进度迟缓，甚至推不动；或者是工作的布置确有错误和不周之处，做到中间或末后才发现错了，造成损失。把不同的意见都明摆出来辩论一番，这些情况就都容易避免发生。辩不好，顶牛了，打起架来，怎么办？应当相信，把辩论的方法用得习以为常了，正是从根本上避免发生严重纠纷的方法。
    哪个地方在日常工作中都能运用这个方法了，那可就可以说：又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、既有集中又有民主，那种政治局面在哪个地方是形成了。
