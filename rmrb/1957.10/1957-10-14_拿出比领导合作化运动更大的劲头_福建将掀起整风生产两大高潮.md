Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 12th - The Rectification Office of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a meeting of heads of rural rectification work from various local committees, deciding to launch two high tides of rectification and production in the rural areas of the province.

    After listening to reports on the current situation of the unfolding of the great debate in rural areas, the meeting pointed out that although a high tide of great debate has gradually formed throughout the province after full airing of views, many regions have not sufficiently implemented the principle of "no delay in rectification and production." Many cadres do not adequately recognize the great significance of launching an agricultural production movement and have not rapidly launched an agricultural production high tide following the high tide of the socialist education movement of the great debate. In response to this situation, the meeting subsequently required local leaders to repeatedly educate rural party members and the vast number of rural cadres, urging them to put in even greater enthusiasm than they did when leading the cooperative movement to lead these two major movements, so that these two major movements can achieve great victory in the rural areas of the province.

    The meeting emphasized that during the movement, Party committees at all levels, township branches, and work teams should make unified arrangements for rectification and production work and fully strengthen leadership. In leading the agricultural production movement, all localities should pay attention to publicizing the vigorous development of the mountain economy, and also actively carry out mass movements for building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer and selecting seeds, in order to make effective preparations for next year's major production movement as early as possible.

    拿出比领导合作化运动更大的劲头
    福建将掀起整风生产两大高潮
    据新华社福州12日电　中共福建省委整风办公室最近召开了各地委农村整风工作负责人会议，决定在全省农村掀起整风、生产两大高潮。
    会议听取了关于农村当前大辩论开展情况的汇报后指出，全省农村经过充分鸣放，大辩论高潮虽已逐步形成，但不少地区对整风、生产两不误贯彻执行不够，有许多干部对开展农业生产运动的重大意义认识不足，还没有随着大辩论这个社会主义教育运动高潮迅速地掀起一个农业生产高潮。针对这个情况，会后要求各地领导必须向农村党员和广大农村干部反复教育，拿出比领导合作化运动更大的劲头来领导这两大运动，使这两大运动在全省农村获得巨大胜利。
    会议强调指出，在运动中各级党委和乡支部、工作组要对整风和生产工作作统一安排，全力加强领导。在领导农业生产运动中各地应注意宣传大力发展山区经济生产，还要积极开展群众性的兴修小型农田水利和积肥、选种运动，为明年的大生产运动及早进行有效的准备。
