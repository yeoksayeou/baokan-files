"The Soviet Party and government nurtured me into adulthood like a mother." Su Heqing said, his face revealing gratitude as he recalled the nearly twenty years of his youth spent in the Soviet Union. He always remembered the earnest advice of his teachers who nurtured him: "You must always remember what Lenin said: Study, study, and study again! Master your skills and grow up to liberate your homeland, which is still in shackles, and build your country into a happy place like the Soviet Union!"

Su Heqing is now a photographer at the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio. His father, Su Zhaozheng, a martyr, led the famous Guangzhou Uprising of workers and soldiers in 1927 and died of illness in 1929. At that time, due to the White Terror, the Party organization sent Su Heqing, his mother, and his sister to the Soviet Union in 1929. He was only seven years old then. He and his sister went to school at the International Children's School near Moscow. Two years later, the school was renamed the "International Stasova Children's School" and moved to Ivanovo. He studied there for five years, and the warm and happy childhood life at that school left him with unforgettable memories.

The "International Stasova Children's School" was built with money donated by workers all over the Soviet Union during the most difficult years of the Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan. It housed the children of Communists and revolutionary martyrs from more than 30 countries, including China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, and Spain. There, Soviet workers were cultivating a new generation for the working-class brothers who were struggling hard in various countries.

Ivanovo is a famous Soviet working-class city, and the school was located on the banks of the Red Talka River, where workers frequently gathered during the 1905 Revolution. The school buildings were spacious, with comfortable classrooms, dormitories, as well as a hospital, sports field, theater, etc. The head of this school, Stasova, was the chairman of the International Relief Society at the time and an old Bolshevik who had worked with the great revolutionary teacher Lenin. Recalling the situation at the time, Su Heqing said: "She cared for the next generation of Communists from various countries with a motherly heart. As soon as she entered the school, the children would gather around her, and many small faces of different colors would smile at her. She personally went to the school to inspect the work and arrange the children's studies and life. She paid special attention to our health and learning our native languages. I still remember what the tall and thin principal Rabin often encouraged us with: 'Work hard to learn the language and literature of your motherland, and grow up to liberate your "mother"—your homeland.' The counselors in the school loved us like mothers, and in their spare time, they told revolutionary stories of Spain, China, Germany, and other countries."

The workers from the factories near the school also often met with these students. Once, an old worker took them to the Red Talka River and told them with a heavy heart about the heroic battles of the workers against the Tsarist police during the 1905 Revolution. According to Su Heqing, this event left a deep impression on his young mind.

Su Heqing took out several thick photo albums, which still contained some photos of his childhood life. One of them showed children from China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria doing carpentry together during their spare time. He said that during their studies, the Soviet teachers paid great attention to labor education, sometimes taking them to nearby collective farms to help farmers with harvesting, and sometimes to factories. Once, several of them used their spare time to make a ping-pong table by themselves, and they were praised by the principal.

At that time, the Soviet Union was in a difficult period, and ordinary people had a ration for bread. However, the Soviet government gave special care to the children of various countries at the International Stasova Children's School, providing them with sufficient food and drink (milk) according to their needs. During the holidays, they were also sent to the Crimean Peninsula for recuperation. Su Heqing said: "The Soviet Party and government really took care of us in every possible way!"

After Su Heqing finished middle school, he entered the Film University according to his wishes and preferences. At that time, in order to enable him to master photography techniques as soon as possible and strive to return to China to participate in the revolution, the school leaders specially invited a famous photographer, Dr. Liviski, to give him extra lectures. Liviski was in his sixties, a meritorious artist who had won the Stalin Prize. His only daughter worked in another place, and only the old couple lived at home. The old couple loved Su Heqing as if he were their own child. Once, the old professor took Su Heqing fishing and pointed to the fishing rod and said, "If we take fishing as the theme, how should we handle the expression in photography?" Su Heqing's answer was not perfect enough, so the old professor patiently taught him. Once, the old professor talked about his early experience of meeting Lenin, saying that after the October Revolution, after Comrade Lenin recovered from his injury, he went to film the great leader's work and life in the Kremlin. Comrade Lenin told him: "Shoot less of my activities, and more of the activities of the masses."

The old professor said to Su Heqing: "The great leader never forgets the masses, you must remember Comrade Lenin's words, it will be more meaningful to shoot films of leaders and the masses together in the future." He also encouraged him to overcome all difficulties after returning to China, and strive to film the deeds of the Chinese people's revolution and dedicate his skills to the revolutionary cause.

Since returning to China in 1946, Su Heqing overcame various difficulties in photography during the Liberation War and filmed "News No. 1"—a documentary film about the liberation of Zhengding, Dingxian, and other places, and was credited for it once. After the national liberation, he also participated in the photography work of the Chinese-Soviet co-production film "Liberated China" and won the Stalin Prize. He also won the gold medal awarded by the Ministry of Culture this year for shooting excellent documentary films such as "Long Live Peace!"

Su Heqing concluded by saying: "I am now able to take on the photography work and shoot some films that the people love, which should all be attributed to the Soviet Party and government that nurtured me into adulthood, and thank those teachers who painstakingly educated me." (Attached pictures)

In 1952, when Su Heqing went to the Soviet Union as a member of the Chinese film delegation to participate in the Chinese Film Week, he met the Martindov family, his neighbors at the "International Stasova Children's School." Xinhua News Agency

    “苏联——我的母亲！”——访在苏联抚育下长大的苏河清　　　
    新华社记者　刘佩珩
    “苏联的党和政府，像母亲一样把我抚育长大成人。”苏河清说到这里，感激的心情在脸上流露了出来，他回忆起在苏联度过近二十年的青少年生活，他时时记着抚育他的老师亲切的叮咛：“你们要时刻记住列宁所说的：学习，学习，再学习！学好本领，长大去解放你们还套着枷锁的祖国，把自己祖国建设成像苏联一样幸福的国家！”
    苏河清现在是中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的摄影师，他父亲苏兆征烈士在1927年领导广州工人和士兵举行了有名的广州起义，1929年因病逝世。当时由于白色恐怖，党组织在1929年把苏河清和他母亲、姐姐都送到了苏联。那时他仅七岁，他和姐姐都到莫斯科附近的国际儿童学校里读书，两年后，学校改名为“国际斯达索娃儿童学校”，迁到了伊万诺夫城。他在那个学校里读了五年，学校里温暖、幸福的童年生活，给他留下了永生难忘的记忆。
      “国际斯达索娃儿童学校”是在苏联第一个五年计划时期最艰苦的年月里，由全苏联工人捐献出来的钱建成的，收容了中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、法国、西班牙等三十多个国家的共产党人和革命烈士的子女。在那里，苏联的工人们，为正在艰苦斗争中的各国工人阶级弟兄培养新生一代。
    伊万诺夫城是苏联有名的工人城，校址就坐落在1905年革命时工人经常集会的地方——红代卡河畔。校舍很宽广，有舒适的教室、宿舍，还有医院、运动场、剧场等。这座学校的主持人斯达索娃是当时的国际救济会主席，是曾经和伟大革命导师列宁一起工作过的老布尔什维克。苏河清回忆当时的情况说：“她用慈母般的心情关怀着各国共产党人的下一代。她一走进学校，孩子们就围拢起来，多少张肤色不同的小脸都朝着她微笑。她亲自到学校检查工作，安排孩子们的学习和生活。格外注意我们的健康和学习本国语言。我至今还记得瘦瘦高个的校长拉宾经常勉励我们的一句话：‘努力学习祖国的语言文学，长大好去解放你们的“母亲”——祖国。’学校里的辅导员像妈妈一样疼爱我们，在业余时就讲西班牙、中国、德国等国家的革命故事。”
    学校附近工厂的工人也经常和这些学生们见面。有一次，有个老工人带他们到红代卡河边，心情沉重地讲述1905年革命时工人在那里和沙皇警察英勇战斗的事迹。这件事，据苏河清回忆，在他幼小的心灵上留下了深刻的印象。
    苏河清拿出几本厚厚的贴相簿，里面还留着几张童年生活的照片。其中有一张是中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚的儿童课余时在一起作木工。他说他们在学习时，苏联老师很注意劳动教育，有时带他们到附近的集体农庄帮助农民收割，有时到工厂里去。有一次，他们几个孩子利用课余时间自己动手作了一个乒乓球桌子，还受到校长的表扬。
      当时，苏联正处在困难时期，一般人领面包都有定量。可是苏联政府对国际斯达索娃儿童学校的各国孩子却特别照顾，不论是吃的喝的（牛奶）都按照他们的需要充足供给。到了假期，还送到克里米亚半岛去休养。苏河清说：“苏联党和政府对我们真是照顾得无微不至啊！”
    苏河清读完中学以后，按照自己的愿望和喜爱升入了电影大学。当时，学校领导为了使他尽快地掌握摄影的技术，争取早日回国参加革命，还特地请一位有名的摄影师里维斯基博士在课外给他讲课。里维斯基年过六旬，是位功勋艺术家，曾得过斯大林奖金，他的唯一的女儿在外地工作，家里只有老夫妻两人。老夫妻俩都像对待亲生孩子那样疼爱苏河清。有一次老教授带着苏河清一起去钓鱼，指着钓鱼杆说：“以我们钓鱼作主题，在摄影时该怎样处理表现呢？”苏河清解答的不够完善，老教授就耐心教他。有一次，老教授讲起他早年见到列宁的一段往事说：那是十月革命后，列宁同志受伤后恢复了健康，他去拍摄这位伟大领袖在克里姆林宫工作、生活的一些情景。列宁同志告诉他：“少拍我的活动，要多拍些人民群众的活动。”
    老教授对苏河清说：“伟大的领袖时刻都不忘群众，你要记住列宁同志的话，今后要拍摄领袖和群众在一起的生活的影片更有意义。”并勉励他回国后，一定要克服一切困难，努力拍摄下中国人民革命的事迹，把本领献给革命事业。
    苏河清从1946年回国后，在解放战争时期，克服摄影上的种种困难，拍摄成“新闻第一号”——解放正定、定县等地的纪录影片，因此立功一次。全国解放后，他又参与中、苏两国合作的“解放了的中国”影片的摄影工作，获得斯大林奖金。他又以拍摄“和平万岁！”等优秀纪录影片，获得了文化部今年颁发的金质奖章。
    苏河清最后说：“我现在能担负起摄影工作，拍摄一些人民喜爱的影片，这都应归功抚育我长大成人的苏联党和政府，感谢那些费尽千辛万苦教育我的老师们。”（附图片）
