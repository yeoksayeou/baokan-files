Xinhua News Agency, October 8th: New York Dispatch: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar said at the United Nations General Assembly plenary session on the 7th that in the face of strong Arab national unity, the Western countries' attempts to isolate Syria will not succeed.

Bitar, in response to the speech made by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles at the beginning of the general debate that distorted the truth, exposed the truth of the United States' blatant interference in the Middle East situation. He said that the United States is the main actor in the Middle East, and it is trying to fill the "vacuum" of European colonialist forces. The United States has taken actions such as subversion, provocations, military demonstrations, and the concentration of troops on the Syrian border to threaten Syria. Bitar pointed out that the United States is trying to force Syria to abandon its policy of not participating in military blocs. Bitar reiterated Syria's neutral policy of not participating in military blocs and its will to safeguard its independence and sovereignty.

The head of the Bulgarian delegation, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Tarabanov, in his speech on the Middle East issue, condemned the United States' active launch of attacks on Syria because Syrian leaders were unwilling to act as puppets of Washington. He also criticized the attitude of Western countries in obstructing progress in disarmament negotiations, and expressed firm support for the Soviet proposal to reach an agreement on the non-use of nuclear weapons and the cessation of nuclear testing.

Xinhua News Agency, October 8th: London Dispatch: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali, in a BBC television program on the evening of the 7th, reiterated Syria's policy of active neutrality and accused some people of distorting Syria's relations with the Soviet Union. Al-Asali said that the Soviet Union understands Syria, stands with Syria, and sells weapons to it. If the United States had ever done so, Syria would have given its friendship to the United States.

Al-Asali said: "We are not communists. We have not had a coup or revolution in seventeen months, and we have not changed governments. Our policies and ideas remain the same."

Al-Asali also said: "We are arming ourselves, but the purpose of our arming is to strengthen our national defense and resist Israeli aggression. We do not intend to give a Syrian base to the East or the West. We have paid a high price for our independence, and we are not prepared to sacrifice that independence by giving bases to anyone."

    叙外长在联大抨击杜勒斯颠倒黑白
    揭穿美国干涉中东的真相
    叙总理指责有人歪曲叙苏关系
    据新华社8日讯　纽约消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔7日在联合国大会全体会议上说，在强大的阿拉伯民族团结面前，西方国家要孤立叙利亚的企图是不能得逞的。
    比塔尔针对美国国务卿杜勒斯在一般辩论刚开始时所发表的颠倒黑白的演说，揭穿了美国露骨地干涉中东局势的真相。他说，美国是在中东的主要行动者，它正在设法填补欧洲殖民主义力量的“真空”。美国采取了颠覆活动、挑衅、军事示威、在叙利亚边境集结军队等行动对叙利亚进行威胁。比塔尔指出，美国是企图这样来迫使叙利亚放弃不参加军事集团的政策的。比塔尔重申了叙利亚不参加军事集团的中立政策和维护自己独立和主权的意志。
    保加利亚代表团团长、外交部副部长塔拉巴诺夫发言谈到中东问题时，谴责美国积极发动对叙利亚的进攻是因为叙利亚领导人不愿充当华盛顿的傀儡。他还指责西方国家阻挠裁军谈判取得进展的态度，并表示坚决支持苏联关于就不使用核武器和停止核试验问题达成协议的建议。
    据新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利在英国广播公司7日晚间的电视节目中，重申叙利亚的积极中立政策，并且指责有些人歪曲叙利亚同苏联的关系。阿萨利说，苏联了解叙利亚，同叙利亚站在一起，并且把武器卖给它。如果美国也曾经这样做的话，叙利亚也就会把它的友谊给予美国。
    阿萨利说：“我们并不是共产党人。我们十七个月来没有发生过政变或革命，没有换过政府。我们的政策和思想依然如故。”
    阿萨利还说：“我们正在武装起来，但是我们武装的目的是要巩固我们的国防和抵抗以色列侵略。我们不打算把一个叙利亚基地给予东方或西方。我们曾为我们的独立付出过昂贵的代价，现在并不准备把基地给予任何人从而牺牲这种独立。”（附图片）
