    Let More Than Ninety Percent of Employees Speak Their Minds
    Our Reporter Zhang Jing, Zhen Weimin
    A week ago, at the fourth rectification mobilization meeting of the Suzhou Chemical Plant, Yu Huazhang, the secretary of the Party General Branch, proposed the slogan "Let more than 90% of the employees speak their minds." A week later, this call has become a reality at the plant.
    This slogan is an important sign of deep and thorough airing of views in factories, put forward by the higher-level Party committee. To achieve this requirement, the Suzhou Chemical Plant has done a lot of meticulous work.
    Is it "Good Enough"?
    The Suzhou Chemical Plant was one of the first factories to carry out airing of views among employees. From August 15th to September 10th, the employees of the plant had successively submitted 774 criticisms to the factory leadership and posted 152 big-character posters. It seemed that the airing of views had gained momentum, and some leading cadres became complacent, thinking that "it's good enough, we can relax a bit." Some people said, "Our errors and shortcomings are only like this, we can't come up with anything more." Even a few leading cadres were afraid of being "exposed as stinky" and wanted to take the opportunity to call it quits. These thoughts hindered the in-depth development of the rectification movement.
    But was it really "good enough"? At a general branch meeting, everyone calmly conducted an inspection and analysis. The content of the inspection was: (1) Have all the opinions of the masses been aired? (2) Have all those who have opinions about me given me their opinions? (3) What is the content of the opinions? (4) Have the three isms (subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism) been completely exposed? (5) Has the democratic atmosphere become fully active? (6) Are the masses satisfied with the work that has been improved? After this inspection, the members of the general branch present shook their heads and said, "Judging from this, we are far from it!"
    The Party General Branch also mobilized the masses of employees to discuss: (1) Have opinions been expressed to the leaders with the most opinions? (2) Have major shortcomings in the work been raised? (3) Have opinions on national affairs, policies, and guidelines been raised? Through this discussion, a new upsurge of finding shortcomings, raising opinions, and expressing opinions was set off in various groups. In their spare time, in groups of two or three, some looked for shortcomings in their work, and some discussed right and wrong in national affairs. In this way, everyone's free thinking was fully utilized, and the content of airing of views became more extensive and profound than before.
    With the mind liberated, the next step was to help the employees express their opinions. In addition to the big-character posters that everyone was already familiar with, the Suzhou Chemical Plant also adopted several forms of airing of views suitable for various people. These forms played a good auxiliary role to the big-character posters.
    Ghostwriting Station
    Judging from the big-character posters that have been posted, the proportion of office staff among those who write big-character posters is very large, and some have posted seven or eight in a row; however, many workers in the workshop have low cultural levels and can only speak but not write when they have opinions. Therefore, the factory leadership opened a rectification ghostwriting station in the library. Any employee who has opinions and wants to write big-character posters can go to the ghostwriting station to find someone to write for them. The ghostwriting station is open three times a day according to the three shifts, and nine office workers with higher cultural levels take turns on duty to write big-character posters for the workers. This method is very popular among the workers. On the second day of the establishment of the ghostwriting station, a small library was crowded with people, and there was a long queue outside the door. The three people on duty recorded and wrote, too busy to attend to everything. Some workers waited until their big-character posters were written and posted them by themselves before leaving. Li Songchen, a car driver who has never been very fond of expressing opinions in political movements, went to the ghostwriting station to write three big-character posters on September 17th, and put forward some criticisms to the Party General Branch Secretary and the factory director. He is usually very humorous, and the big-character posters he wrote are also lively and powerful. For example, one of his big-character posters criticizing Yu Huazhang, the secretary of the Party General Branch, was written like this: "Secretary Yu, can you answer me? Last year, I went to Shanghai to buy a car, and I've been keeping it there, sometimes touching it, sometimes ignoring it. The meter on the car was taken away by the porter, and the inside of the car has become a breeding ground for mice. It's about to rust! What did you buy it for?..." After Li Songchen's three big-character posters appeared in the canteen, they attracted a lot of attention. Everyone said, "Even Master Li has spoken up this time, it's really not easy!"
    From its establishment on September 13th to September 19th, the ghostwriting station wrote nearly 100 big-character posters for workers in one week. These big-character posters concretely and powerfully exposed the three major isms in leadership.
    Reception Room
    At a forum with non-Party members, Zhang Zhilin and others suggested that some people are unwilling to write big-character posters, but they would like to have individual talks with the leaders, believing that this would solve the problem more quickly. The Party General Branch accepted this suggestion and immediately established a rectification reception room. The rectification reception room was located in the General Branch Office. After this news spread, the General Branch Office became lively, with more than a dozen people coming to talk every day. Zhang Cining, an employee of the Capital Construction Section, was unwilling to post big-character posters, but in an individual conversation with the Secretary of the Party General Branch, he raised ten opinions at once. He said: In the past, I didn't talk to the Secretary of the General Branch, and I felt uncomfortable with my opinions in my stomach. I felt happy after talking.
    Visiting Group
    There are also some employees and workers in the factory who have opinions but are unwilling to write them into big-character posters, nor are they willing to take the initiative to talk to the leaders. How can these people's opinions be expressed? After research, the General Branch Committee absorbed the Party member section chiefs and established a rectification visiting group to take the initiative to have heart-to-heart talks with them and solicit their opinions on the leadership. Factory Director Li Guang'en visited Wang Changfu, who usually had more opinions, and had a three-hour conversation with him. Li Guang'en's sincere attitude enabled Wang Changfu to express his opinions and views on issues such as cadre promotion, rectification leadership, the attitude of Party members and cadres in airing of views, employee wages, and student enrollment more freely. After the conversation, Wang Changfu also wrote some of his opinions into big-character posters.
    At a forum of veteran workers, Song Yungang, a veteran worker with ten years of experience, mentioned that some people are not used to face-to-face criticism. It is best to let veteran workers also participate in the visiting group and visit on behalf of the leaders, so that they can hear some opinions that are not convenient to criticize in person. His suggestion was immediately supported by the Secretary of the General Branch; the seventeen veteran workers present also expressed their agreement. The participation of these veteran workers in the visit is of great help to the leaders in understanding the demands of the masses and improving their work. Veteran worker Shen Qiyu used his spare time to chat with familiar workers and heard many opinions that were not easily heard by the leaders. The reason why the car driver Li Songchen mentioned earlier was able to post three big-character posters criticizing the leadership in one day was largely related to the visit and encouragement of the veteran worker Song Yungang.
    The employees who have been visited have eliminated ideological concerns, and many people have written their opinions buried in their hearts into big-character posters to express them. Sun Jixian wrote four big-character posters in one night after being visited.
    Suggestion Box
    In order to enable a small number of employees who are unwilling to write big-character posters and unwilling to talk to the leaders, and whom the leaders do not have time to visit, to express their opinions, the factory specially set up a rectification suggestion box. Now, the suggestion box has received more than a dozen letters of opinion, and some have also reflected some important issues. There are also some people who, although they have written big-character posters, have also used the form of suggestion box because the big-character posters have limited space and they cannot express themselves freely. For example, Yang Jingren wrote three big-character posters and also wrote a 2,000-word letter of opinion, criticizing the leadership for factionalism.
    Rectify and Improve Simultaneously
    Rectifying and improving simultaneously is a more powerful encouragement for the masses to conduct in-depth airing of views. Under the direct leadership of the Party committee, the Suzhou Chemical Plant established a special group responsible for timely studying the opinions of the masses, and immediately organized improvements when possible. More than seventy items have been improved or are being improved. The worker Shen Qiyu criticized the factory's waste of raw materials in a blackboard newspaper entitled "A pile of refractory bricks, bones all over the place." After this opinion was raised, the capital construction department quickly cleaned up the pile of refractory bricks in the open air, and the leading cadres also cleaned up all the scattered bones on Saturday's labor day. Both opinions were realized within a week. The bone meal bag filter in the bone meal workshop was broken, causing bone meal to fly everywhere, resulting in a loss of more than one ton of bone meal every day. The workers had raised this issue long ago, but it was not taken seriously by the workshop leaders; this time, during the rectification, the workers raised sharp criticisms again. In less than three days, the leaders replaced the bag filter with a new cloth bag, and the phenomenon of bone meal waste was quickly stopped. Similar examples abound. The masses saw that the opinions they raised were quickly accepted by the leaders and that improvements were made quickly, and their emotions were greatly encouraged, and their enthusiasm for raising opinions was even higher.
    After this in-depth and meticulous work, from September 12th to 16th, in five days, the number of big-character posters in the factory increased from 152 to 365. The number of people who poured out their opinions to the leaders through various forms has reached 213, accounting for 96% of the 248 people in the factory.

    让百分之九十以上的职工说出心里话
    本报记者  张竞  甄为民
    一星期以前，在苏州化工厂第四次整风动员会上，党总支书记于华章同志提出了“让90％以上的职工都说出心里话”的口号。一星期以后，这个号召已经变成了这个厂的现实的成绩。
    这个口号是上级党委提出的在工厂中鸣放深透的重要标志。为了达到这个要求，苏州化工厂做了不少细致的工作。
    是不是“差不多”了
    苏州化工厂是在职工中开展鸣放较早的工厂。从8月15日到9月10日，这个厂的职工群众已经陆续向工厂领导方面提出了七百七十四条批评意见，贴了一百五十二张大字报。看样子鸣放已经有了声势，有些领导干部于是自满起来，以为“差不多了，可以松松劲了”。有的人说：“我们的错误缺点也不过如此，再提也提不出什么了。”甚至有个别领导干部怕自己被“揭臭”了，因而想趁此收兵。这些思想对于整风运动的深入开展是有妨碍的。
    到底是不是“差不多”了呢？在一次总支会议上，大家平心静气地作了一次检查分析。检查的内容是：（一）群众意见是不是放完了？（二）对我有意见的人是否都向我提了意见？（三）提意见的内容怎样？（四）三个主义是否完全揭发干净了？（五）民主空气是否完全活跃起来了？（六）已经改进的工作，群众是否满意？经过这一检查，到会的总支委员们都摇摇头说：“照这样看，差得还远呢！”
    党总支还发动职工群众进行了讨论：（一）对最有意见的领导人提意见了没有？（二）工作中的重大缺点提出来了没有？（三）对国家大事、方针政策方面的意见提了没有？通过这一讨论，各小组里又掀起了一个找缺点、提意见、发表议论的热潮。他们在业余时间，三三两两，有的在工作中找缺点，有的在国家大事上论是非。这样一来，充分发挥了大家的自由思想，鸣放的内容较前更加广泛，更加深刻了。
    思想解放了，接下来就是要帮助职工们把自己的意见表达出来。除了大家已经熟悉的大字报以外，苏州化工厂又采取了几种适合于各种人的鸣放形式。这些形式对大字报起了很好的辅助作用。
    代笔站
    从已经贴出的大字报来看，写大字报的人当中科室人员占了很大的比重，有的人已经连续贴出七、八张；但是车间里有不少工人因为文化水平低，有意见只会讲不会写。于是，工厂领导方面就在图书室里开辟了一个整风代笔站，凡是有意见想写大字报的职工，都可以到代笔站找人代笔。代笔站每天按三班上下班时间开放三次，由九个文化水平较高的职员，轮流值班为工人代笔书写大字报。这个办法很受工人们的欢迎。代笔站成立的第二天，一间小图书室里就挤满了人，门外还排着长长的队伍，三个值班的人边记边写，应接不暇，有的工人一直等到自己的大字报写好，亲手贴出去才离开。一向在政治运动中不大爱表示意见的汽车驾驶员李松臣，在9月17日一天，就到代笔站去写了三张大字报，向党总支书记、厂长等提出了一些批评。他平时为人很幽默，写的大字报也生动有力。例如他批评党总支书记于华章的一张大字报是这样写的：“于书记，你能回答我吗？去年去上海买了一部小汽车，一直放在那里，有时动动它，有时连理也不理它。车上的表叫搬运工人拿走了，车子里面竟成了小老鼠的温床，它已经快要生锈啦！究竟买它来干什么？……”李松臣的这三张大字报在饭堂里出现以后，引起了很多人的注意。大家说：“这回连李师傅也开腔了，真不简单呀！”
    代笔站从9月13日建立，到9月19日的一个星期当中，已经为工人代笔写了近一百张大字报。这些大字报具体而有力地揭发了领导上的三大主义。
    接待室
    在一次党外人士座谈会上，张志林等提出，有一些群众不愿意写大字报，但是很想跟领导同志个别交谈，他们认为，这样解决问题可以迅速一些。党总支接受了这个建议，立即成立了整风接待室。整风接待室就设在总支办公室。这个消息传出以后，总支办公室就热闹起来了，来谈的人一天就有十几起。基建科职员张赐宁不愿意贴大字报，可是在和党总支书记个别谈话时，一下就提了十条意见。他说：过去没有和总支书记交谈，意见摆在肚子里不舒服，谈了以后才一身愉快。
    访问组
    厂里另外还有一些职员和工人，他们有意见既不愿写成大字报，也不愿意主动找领导上交谈。怎样让这些人的意见也说出来呢？总支委员会研究后吸收党员科长成立了一个整风访问组，主动找他们作倾心长谈，征求他们对领导的意见。厂长李光恩访问了平时意见较多的王长福，和他作了长达三小时的谈话。李光恩的诚恳的态度，使王长福比较畅快地谈出了他对干部提拔、整风领导、鸣放中党员、干部的态度以及职工工资、学生升学等问题的意见和看法。谈话以后，王长福又把他的一些意见写成了大字报。
    在一次老工人座谈会上，有十年工龄的老工人宋云刚提到，有些人面对面的批评还不习惯，最好让老工人也参加访问组，替领导去访问，这样更可以听到一些不便当面批评的意见。他的建议马上得到总支书记的支持；在座的十七个老工人也表示赞同。这些老工人参加访问，对于领导人员了解群众要求、改进工作有很大帮助。老工人沈其煜利用业余时间和熟悉的工人聊天，听到了很多领导上不容易听到的意见。前面提到的汽车驾驶员李松臣，所以能在一天当中贴出三张批评领导的大字报，同老工人宋云刚的访问和鼓励有很大关系。
    被访问过的职工，消除了思想顾虑，很多人都把自己埋在心里的意见写成大字报表达出来。孙吉先在被访问以后，一晚上就写了四张大字报。
    意见箱
    为了使一小部分不愿意写大字报，又不愿意找领导谈，同时领导人员又来不及访问的职工发表意见，厂里特地设立了一个整风意见箱。现在，意见箱里已经收到十多封意见书，有的也反映了一些重要的问题。还有一些人，虽然写了大字报，但是因为大字报篇幅有限，不能畅所欲言，也利用了意见箱这一形式。例如，杨镜人写了三张大字报，还写了一篇长达两千字的意见书，批评领导上有宗派主义。
    边整边改
    边整边改，对于群众深入鸣放是一个更有力的鼓励。苏州化工厂在党委直接领导下成立了一个专门小组，负责及时研究群众的意见，能改的马上组织改进。现在已经改进和正在改进的有七十多条。工人沈其煜在黑板报上以“一堆耐火砖，遍地是骨头”为题，批评工厂在原材料方面的浪费现象。这个意见提出以后，基建部门很快就把露天里的一堆耐火砖收拾好，领导干部也在星期六的劳动日，把所有散失的骨头收拾起来。两个意见，一星期内就都实现了。骨粉车间的骨粉袋滤机坏了，弄得骨粉到处飞扬，每天要损失骨粉一吨以上。这个问题，工人早就提了意见，但是没有受到车间领导的重视；这次整风，工人又提出了尖锐的批评。不到三天，领导方面就在袋滤机上换了一个新的布袋，骨粉浪费的现象很快就停止了。类似的例子，还可举出很多。群众看到自己提的意见很快就为领导上接受，而且很快就有了改进，情绪受到很大鼓舞，提意见的积极性也更高了。
    经过这一番深入的细致的工作，从9月12日到16日的五天中，全厂大字报从一百五十二张增加到三百六十五张。通过各种形式向领导上倾吐意见的人数，已经有二百一十三人，占全厂二百四十八人的96％。
