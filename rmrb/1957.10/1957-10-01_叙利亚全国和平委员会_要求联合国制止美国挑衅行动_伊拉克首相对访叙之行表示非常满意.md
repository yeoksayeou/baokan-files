Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 30th. The Syrian National Peace Committee wrote to the UN Secretariat requesting that the UN stop the US provocative actions against Syria, pay attention to the concentration of Turkish and Israeli troops on the Syrian border, and stop the aggression against Syria.

The letter accuses the United States of publicly violating the UN Charter through actions such as: provocative actions by the US fleet in Syrian territorial waters, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson drawing up plans for open aggression against Syria, pressure exerted in an attempt to impose the "Eisenhower Doctrine" on Syria, conspiracies by US diplomatic personnel in Damascus, attempts to paralyze Syrian industry and commerce, and inciting relations between Syria and its neighbors.

The letter stated that the Syrian people are peace-loving, they long for an end to the arms race and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and firmly believe in the Bandung principles and the policy of positive neutrality. They also hope to live in peace and friendship with all countries.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Baghdad News: Iraqi Prime Minister al-Ayoubi told the Syrian Ambassador to Iraq, Mardam, on September 29 that he was "very satisfied" with his recent trip to Damascus.

Al-Ayoubi recently issued a statement after visiting Damascus saying that aggression against Syria or any other Arab country would be considered aggression against Iraq. Al-Ayoubi's statement also said that he believes that "the situation cannot sever the nationalistic ties between Iraq and Syria or any other Arab country."

    信中指责美国公然违反联合国宪章的行为，这些行为有：美国舰队在叙利亚领海内的挑衅行动，美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊拟订公开侵略叙利亚计划，企图把“艾森豪威尔主义”强加在叙利亚身上而施加的压力，美国驻大马士革外交人员的阴谋活动，想使叙利亚工商业陷入瘫痪状态的企图，挑拨叙利亚邻国和叙利亚之间的关系等。
    信中说，叙利亚人民是爱好和平的，他们渴望停止军备竞赛以及禁止原子武器和氢武器，坚信万隆原则和积极中立政策。并且希望和一切国家和平友好地共处。
    据新华社30日讯  巴格达消息：伊拉克首相阿尤比9月29日告诉叙利亚驻伊拉克公使马尔杜姆说，他对他最近的大马士革之行感到“非常满意”。
    阿尤比最近在访问大马士革后曾经发表声明说，对叙利亚或任何其他阿拉伯国家的侵略将被认为是对伊拉克的侵略。阿尤比的声明还说，他相信，“局势不可能割断伊拉克和叙利亚或任何其他阿拉伯国家之间的民族主义联系”。
