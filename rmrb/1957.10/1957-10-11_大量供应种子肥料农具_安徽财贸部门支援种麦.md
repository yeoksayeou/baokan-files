Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, October 10th: Anhui Province's financial and trade departments are vigorously supporting farmers in combating drought and planting wheat. By the end of September, supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the province had supplied farmers with 15,000 horse-drawn waterwheels, more than 15,400 double-wheeled double-share plows, disc harrows, seeders, and more than 65,566,000 catties of chemical fertilizer. The supply of these means of production has greatly exceeded that of last year. Recently, supply and marketing cooperatives will also allocate more than 2,000 horse-drawn waterwheels, more than 6,000 double-wheeled double-share plows, and 17,660,000 catties of chemical fertilizer.

In order to support farmers in combating drought and planting wheat, in addition to the more than 10 million catties of improved wheat and barley seeds already transferred from the Fuyang, Bengbu, and Lu'an Special Districts to the Wuhu and Anqing Special Districts, the grain departments are now preparing to transfer another 2 million catties of barley seeds to support farmers in these two special districts in combating drought and planting wheat. On the 8th, the Anhui Provincial Grain Bureau also issued instructions, requiring local grain departments to select and reserve a portion of barley and wheat in order to promptly support farmers in combating drought and planting wheat.

    新华社合肥10日电　安徽省财贸部门大力支援农民抗旱种麦。到9月底止，全省供销合作社已供应农民一万五千部马拉水车，一万五千四百多部双轮双铧犁、圆盘耙、播种机和六千五百五十六万多斤化学肥料。供应的这些生产资料都大大超过去年。最近，供销合作社还将调拨二千多部马拉水车，六千多部双轮双铧犁和一千七百六十六万斤化学肥料。
    为了支援农民抗旱种麦，粮食部门除了已从阜阳、蚌埠、六安三专区调拨一千多万斤小麦良种和大麦种给芜湖、安庆两专区外，最近准备再调拨二百万斤大麦种支援这两个专区的农民抗旱种麦。8日，安徽省粮食厅还发出指示，要求各地粮食部门选留一部分大麦、小麦，以便及时地支援农民抗旱种麦。
