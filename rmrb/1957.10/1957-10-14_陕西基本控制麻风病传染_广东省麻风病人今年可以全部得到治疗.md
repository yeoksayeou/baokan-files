　　Shaanxi Basically Controls Leprosy Transmission
    Guangdong Province Leprosy Patients Can All Receive Treatment This Year
    (Our dispatch) Shaanxi Province has made remarkable achievements in leprosy prevention and control work in recent years. Up to now, seventy-four people in the province have been cured and discharged from the hospital, and a group of patients are still under quarantine for observation and will soon be discharged; most of the hospitalized patients have experienced varying degrees of symptom alleviation. Recently, the last batch of leprosy patients within Shaanxi Province have been admitted to hospitals, basically controlling the spread and transmission of leprosy within the province.
    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, on the one hand, they cruelly persecuted the lives of leprosy patients, and on the other hand, they put up the signboard of false charity to treat diseases, establishing a so-called leprosy hospital with only three staff members in a dilapidated temple in Nanzheng County. From 1938 to 1949, over a dozen years, a total of thirty patients were admitted. After liberation, Shaanxi Province listed leprosy prevention and control as an important task of the health department, adopted effective measures of "active prevention and treatment, and control of infection," and repeatedly organized medical personnel to conduct investigations, clarify the number of patients and their distribution throughout the province, and carry out appropriate on-site isolation, centralized admission, and isolation treatment.
    There are currently about four thousand leprosy patients in the province. In order to meet the needs of accommodating scattered patients, the number of beds in leprosy hospitals has been increased to seven hundred and fifty; in addition, two leprosy villages have been newly built in the scenic Shiyan Temple in Nanzheng and Hengkou Town in Ankang, with a capacity of three thousand three hundred people. The last batch of centralized admission work in the province was completed in late September.
    In order to achieve victory in the fight against leprosy and enable patients to be cured as soon as possible, the Shaanxi Provincial Leprosy Hospital has started regular treatment since 1954. It also sent medical personnel to Liaoning to learn from the province's experience in treating leprosy with traditional Chinese medicine, and further expanded the use of traditional Chinese medicine for treatment. Last year, ninety-eight severely ill patients who received slow results from Western medicine treatment or could not accept drug treatment were treated with traditional Chinese medicine, and their symptoms were alleviated to varying degrees. The effective rate for lepromatous patients reached 83%, and the effective rate for tuberculoid patients was even higher. From April to September last year, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Health also sent an electro-acupuncture treatment team to the hospital to try treating leprosy. A total of thirty-two cases were formally treated within five months, of which thirty cases basically achieved recovery. The above treatment methods are being further studied and observed.
    (Our dispatch) There are more than 22,000 leprosy patients in Guangdong Province. Up to now, more than 60% of the total number of leprosy patients in the province have received treatment; it is estimated that by the end of this year, all leprosy patients can receive treatment.
    Before liberation, the reactionary government not only did not take any measures to prevent and control leprosy, but also persecuted leprosy patients in many ways. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government are very concerned about leprosy patients. In recent years, Guangdong Province has trained more than 600 professional cadres for leprosy prevention and control. One hundred and seventeen special prefectural, county and city leprosy prevention and control stations and groups have been established, as well as thirty-four leprosy villages and eleven leprosy hospitals. Comprehensive treatment has also been carried out for leprosy patients who have not been admitted to leprosy hospitals and leprosy villages.
    In order to prevent and control leprosy, the People's Government has allocated huge amounts of funds. Guangdong Province alone has allocated more than 5 million yuan last year and this year.
    In order to run leprosy villages well, the people's committees of various counties have given strong support in terms of manpower and materials. For example, the Qingyuan and Xinhui County People's Committees each allocated more than 30,000 yuan to build leprosy villages. The Wengyuan, Gaoyao, Nanhai and other counties sent the heads of the county civil affairs sections or district party committee members, deputy district chiefs, etc. to serve as directors of the leprosy village offices. They have done a good job in the management and production of leprosy patients. The Wengyuan Leprosy Village has adopted diversified production and management, and patients can be self-sufficient three months after entering the village. The lives of leprosy patients have gradually improved, and everyone can concentrate on production and treatment. The broad masses of people are also very concerned about the leprosy villages and leprosy patients. Some agricultural cooperatives donated production tools to the leprosy villages, and some agricultural cooperatives provided assistance to leprosy patients who had difficulties in life when they first entered the villages.

　　陕西基本控制麻风病传染
    广东省麻风病人今年可以全部得到治疗
    本报讯　陕西省麻风防治工作几年来已取得显著成绩。到目前为止，全省已有七十四人治愈出院，还有一批病人正在进行隔离观察，不久即可出院；住院治疗的患者，大部分症状都有了不同程度的减轻。最近，陕西省境内的最后一批麻风患者已经收容入院，基本控制了麻风病在省内的蔓延和传染。
    国民党反动统治时期，一方面采取残酷的手段迫害麻风病人的生命，另一方面却打着假慈善的治病招牌，在南郑县的破庙里建立了一个仅有三个工作人员的所谓麻风病院。从1938年至1949年十几年内，总共收容了三十名患者。解放后，陕西省把防治麻风列为卫生部门的一项重要任务，采取了“积极防治、控制传染”的有效措施，曾多次组织医务人员进行调查，摸清全省患病人数和分布情况，分别进行适当就地隔离，集中收容和隔离治疗。
    全省现有麻风患者约四千人左右。为了满足收容散在的患者，麻风病院的床位已增加到七百五十张；又在山明水秀的南郑石堰寺和安康恒口镇新建了两个麻风村，收容量达三千三百人。全省最后一批集中收容工作已于9月下旬结束。
    为了取得向麻风病斗争的胜利，使患者得以早日治愈，陕西省麻风病院自1954年起开始了正规治疗。并派医务人员去辽宁学习该省中药治疗麻风的经验，进一步扩大开展中药治疗工作。该院去年经过西医治疗收效很慢或不能接受药物治疗的重病人九十八人，用中药治疗后症状都有了不同程度的减轻，瘤型患者有效率达83％，结核样型患者有效率更高。去年4月至9月，陕西省卫生厅还派电针治疗工作组去该院试治麻风病，五个月内共进行正规治疗三十二例，其中三十例基本达到痊愈。以上治疗方法，正在进一步研究观察中。
    本报讯　广东省共有麻风病人二万二千多人，到目前为止得到治疗的已占全省麻风病人总数的60％以上；预计到今年年底，所有麻风病人都可得到治疗。
    解放前，反动政府不但没有采取任何措施来防治麻风病，而且对麻风病人加以多方的迫害。解放后，党和人民政府对麻风病人是十分关怀的。几年来广东省已训练了麻风病防治专业干部六百多人。建立了专署、县市麻风防治站、组一百一十七个，建立了麻风村三十四个，麻风院十一所。对未能入麻风院及麻风村的麻风病人，也全面开展了治疗。
    为了防治麻风病，人民政府拨出了巨额经费，仅在去年和今年广东省就拨了五百多万元。
    为了办好麻风村，各县人民委员会在人力、物力方面都作了大力支持。如清远、新会县人民委员会就各拨了三万多元建筑麻风村，翁源、高要、南海等县派出县民政科长或区委、副区长等担任麻风村办事处主任，他们对麻风病人的管理及生产都搞得很好。翁源麻风村，采取多样的生产经营，病人入村三个月后，生活就可以自供自给。麻风病人的生活，逐渐得到改善，大家都能安心生产，安心治疗。广大群众对麻疯村及麻风病人也十分关怀，有些农业社赠送生产工具给麻风村，有些麻风病人初入村时生活有困难，农业社就给予帮助。
