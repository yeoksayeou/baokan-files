Following the State Council's issuance of the notice regarding the protection of cultural relics in agricultural production and construction in 1956, all regions across the country, in accordance with the spirit of the notice, immediately launched a cultural relics survey. With the active support of the masses, provinces and cities have now basically completed the initial survey. Twenty-four provinces, autonomous regions, and one city have approved and announced the first batch of cultural relics protection units, totaling 6,726 sites. This batch of announced protection units includes revolutionary sites, ancient cultural ruins, ancient tombs, ancient buildings, caves, stone carvings, etc., such as: the Yin Ruins site in Anyang, Henan Province, the Wang Jian Tomb in Sichuan Province, the Dunhuang Grottoes, the Yungang Grottoes, the Anji Bridge of the Sui Dynasty in Zhao County, and the Jinci Temple in Taiyuan. Revolutionary sites include the revolutionary sites in Ruijin and Yan'an, as well as the Jiaxing Nanhu Lake Yanyu Tower, the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

In recent years, newly discovered cultural relics are even more abundant, such as: the Dingcun site in Xiangfen County, Shanxi Province, the Houma Eastern Zhou site, the Yunnan Shizhaishan ancient cultural site, and the Luoyang Yin Dynasty iron smelting site, which have also been included in the first batch of cultural relics protection units. In addition, several important sites and stone carvings have been discovered this year. For example: five newly discovered Neolithic sites at Yanziji in Nanjing City, where more than 30 pieces of stone tools such as stone axes, stone knives, and arrowheads were collected. A large number of steles related to the history of handicrafts, about 280 pieces, were discovered in Suzhou City. The steles record the development history of various industries and various systems of exploiting workers from the Ming to the Qing dynasties, which are the most valuable historical materials for studying the history of urban handicrafts in China. Two ancient steles were found within the Tianqing Temple site in Guangzhou City, recording the funding by people from Sanfoqi (Sumatra, Indonesia) in the second year of Yuanfeng in the Song Dynasty (1079 AD) to repair Tianqing Temple. The handwriting is still very clear, and the city's Cultural Relics Management Committee is now repairing them. Two stone tablets from the Dashun and Yongchang first year of Li Zicheng were discovered in Shanxi Province. A 2,000-year-old human habitation site was discovered in Harbin City, and more than 100 pieces of pottery and stone tools were collected. These discoveries fully demonstrate the abundance of above-ground and underground relics in our country, and the national cultural relics survey being carried out today is timely and necessary. Now the second national cultural relics review is about to begin, and it is expected that there will be more important and rich gains in the future.

The list and information of the first batch of cultural relics protection units will be compiled and published by the Cultural Relics Publishing House. (Yun)

    全国文物普查初步完成
    地上地下文物遗存十分丰富，第二次复查工作又将开始
    本报讯　自1956年国务院发出关于在农业生产建设中保护文物的通知后，全国各地根据这个通知的精神，即展开文物普查工作，在群众的积极支持下，现在各省市已经基本完成了初步普查工作，二十四省、自治区和一个市批准公布了第一批文物保护单位，共六千七百二十六处。这一批公布的保护单位中，有革命遗迹、古文化遗址、古墓葬、古建筑、洞窟、石刻等，如：河南省安阳殷墟遗址、四川省王建墓、敦煌石窟、云岗石窟、赵县隋代安济桥、太原晋祠等。革命遗迹中有瑞金、延安革命遗址，以及中国共产党第一次代表大会所在地嘉兴烟雨楼等等。
    近几年来新发现的文物更是丰富，如：山西省的襄汾县丁村遗址，侯马东周遗址，云南石寨山古文化遗址，洛阳殷代冶铁遗址等，也已列入第一批文物保护单位。此外，在今年发现了多处重要的遗址和石刻，例如：南京市燕子矶新发现的五处新石器时代遗址，采集了石?、石斧、刀、镞等石器三十余件。苏州市发现大批有关手工业历史的碑刻，约二百八十余块，碑上记载着自明至清的各种不同行业的发展史，和各种剥削工人的制度，是研究我国城市手工业历史最珍贵的史料。广州市天庆观遗址内发现宋代元丰二年（公元1079年）三佛齐国（印度尼西亚苏门答腊）人出资修天庆观的古碑两块，字迹尚很清晰，现在已由该市文物管理委员会进行修整。山西省发现李自成大顺、永昌元年的石碑两块。哈尔滨市发现二千年前人类居住遗址，搜集到陶器、石器共一百多件。这些发现更充分说明了我国地上地下遗存的丰富，而今天进行的全国文物普查工作是及时的，更是必要的。现在全国第二次文物复查工作又将要开始，预计将来还将有更重要而丰富的收获。
    第一批文物保护单位的名单和资料，将由文物出版社整理出版。（云）
