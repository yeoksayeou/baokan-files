In the Altai Mountains of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, forests, grasslands, and large rivers and lakes are favored places for birds to inhabit and breed. There are various warblers and swallows with melodious songs, flocks of geese and wild ducks, as well as the fierce golden eagles and fox eagles that Kazakh hunters like to raise, and also cormorants, mergansers, and seagulls that specialize in catching aquatic life in the rivers and lakes. But the most precious are the swans, as white and smooth as jade, and the penduline tits that weave nests with feathers.

The penduline tit is a unique small bird of the Altai Mountains, only about half the size of a sparrow, with reddish-gray feathers and a beautiful song. Every spring, even the Kazakhs who have lived here for generations do not know where the penduline tits come from. They fly in pairs to the banks of the Qinghe River or the Ulungur River, looking for branches extending into the heart of the river or in places that are inaccessible to humans and animals, and choose a hidden place to build their nests. They first bring some horsehair and mane, and use their beaks to tie it to the branches as warp threads, and then bring sheep's wool, cashmere, and camel down as weft threads, carefully weaving a nest on the branches.

Soon, a palm-sized, fluffy penduline tit nest hangs on the branch, with an entrance the size of an ink bottle cap. When the weather turns cold in the autumn, the adult penduline tits lead the fledglings away. The following spring, the penduline tits fly back again.

It is said that there is also bird droppings inside the penduline tit nests, which can cure arthritis. Patients buy penduline tit nests and apply them to the painful areas for treatment. The cooperatives in the Altai Mountains plan to purchase 3,000 of them this year on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies.

It is still unknown how many rare and exotic animals there are in the Altai Mountains. What is known are antelopes, various deer, as well as Haxiong bears as large as yellow cattle, and moon bears with crescent-shaped markings on their black-brown backs.

The local Kazakh and Mongolian herdsmen have a legend about the moon bear, saying that the crescent on the moon bear's back waxes and wanes with the phases of the moon. Although this is a legend that does not conform to reality, the story sounds so realistic and fascinating.

Otters, sable, ermine, lynx, various foxes, groundhogs, blue sheep, etc. are also produced here. The most numerous are rodent furs. Gray rats, silver rats, chipmunks, yellow rats, squirrels, weasels, etc. are produced here, as well as a flying squirrel with wings that can fly. The state purchases these valuable furs in large quantities every year. Last year, the livestock companies at all levels in the Altai Mountains purchased more than 34,000 pieces.

The Altai Mountains are famous for their fresh and abundant fish production. The most productive fishing areas are Lake Buruntogai, which covers more than 700 square kilometers, and the long Ulungur River. Every year in May, when farmers are irrigating their fields, it coincides with the fish spawning season, and schools of fish swim all the way into the canals and are washed into the farmland. In the corners of the fields near the canals, the accumulated fish often reach a foot in depth.

Winter is the fishing season in the Altai Mountains. Every year, a large amount of frozen fish is transported to Karamay, Urumqi and other industrial and mining areas.

    阿尔泰山区的珍禽异兽
    在新疆维吾尔自治区的阿尔泰山区，森林、草原和大河大湖都是飞禽喜欢栖息繁殖的地方。这里有各种鸣声悦耳的莺、燕，成群的大雁和野鸭，有哈萨克猎手喜欢豢养的凶猛的兔鹰和狐鹰，也有在河湖中专门捕捉水族的鱼鹰、鱼狼和海鸥。但是最珍奇的还要算白润如玉的天鹅和衔毛织窠的灵雀。
    灵雀是阿尔泰山区特有的一种小鸟，只有半个麻雀大，羽毛灰红，鸣声好听。每年春天，连世世代代住在这里的哈萨克人都无法知道灵雀是从哪里飞来的。它们双双对对飞到青河或乌伦古河水滨，寻找伸向河心或者其他人兽无法攀援的树枝，选择隐蔽的地方做窠。它们先衔来一些马尾马鬃，用嘴绑在枝头做经线，然后又衔来羊毛、羊绒、驼绒做纬，在枝头细心地织起窠来。
    不久，一个巴掌大的毛绒绒的灵雀窠挂在枝头，露出一个墨水瓶盖大小的进出口。秋天天气冷了，大灵雀就领着会飞的小灵雀飞走。第二年春天，灵雀又飞来。
    据说灵雀窠里面还有鸟粪，能治关节炎。患者买来灵雀窠敷在疼处治病。阿尔泰山区的合作社，计划今年代医药公司收购三千个。
    阿尔泰山区究竟有多少珍奇野兽，现在还不知道，确知的有羚羊、各种鹿，还有大如黄牛的哈熊，和黑褐色背上生长着形如弯月的月熊。
    当地的哈萨克族和蒙古族牧人对于月熊有一段传说，说月熊背上的月芽可以随着月亮的盈亏而圆缺。这虽然是一种不符合事实的传说，但故事听起来却是那样逼真迷人。
    这里还出产水獭、貂、扫雪、猞猁、各种狐狸、旱貂、青羊等。种类最多的莫如鼠皮了，这里产灰鼠、银鼠、花鼠、黄鼠、松鼠、鼬鼠等等，还有一种长翅能飞的飞鼠。这些名贵的兽皮，国家每年都在大量收购，阿尔泰山区各级畜产公司去年共收购了三万四千多张。
    阿尔泰山区以鱼产鲜美丰富称著。产鱼最多的要算七百多平方公里的布伦托海和漫长的乌伦古河。每年5月农民浇地正逢鱼汛，鱼群一直游进渠道，被冲到农田上。近渠口的田角，积鱼经常盈尺。
    冬季是阿尔泰山区捕鱼的季节，每年这里有大量的冻鱼被运往克拉玛依、乌鲁木齐和其他工矿区。　（新华社稿）（附图片）
