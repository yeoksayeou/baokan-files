Workers Don't Eat More Grain Than Peasants

In Wangguantun Township, Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, during a discussion about internal contradictions among the people in the Guoguang Agricultural Cooperative, some people claimed that 380 jin of retained grain per year was not enough to eat, and that the cadres were making false reports by saying it was enough. Some people advocated supplying grain according to the standards for workers. Others said it was enough and that they shouldn't constantly complain about not having enough to eat. During the heated debate, everyone made the following calculations: A railway worker's family of six receives a monthly grain ration of 46 jin per person, totaling 552 jin per year. The five family members, according to the urban rationing standards, receive a total of 1,316 jin per year. Adding the worker's ration, the family's total annual grain supply is 1,868 jin. A peasant family of the same size, with each person receiving 380 jin, would have a total annual grain supply of 2,280 jin, which is 412 jin more than the worker's family. On average, each peasant eats about 70 jin more grain than a worker. At that time, some people said that urban supplies are commercial grain, while theirs is coarse grain, making the difference even greater. Later, after calculating the grain seed allocation ratio in the cooperative, each peasant still ate 47 jin more than a worker. The result of the calculation was that if the non-laboring population of the peasants were supplied according to the standards for workers' families, the laboring population could eat more than 600 jin.

Some people also said, "Anyway, the state has to take care of our grain problem." Others said, "Who says they aren't taking care of it? Where did the 540,000 jin of grain supplied to our cooperative come from? We have to have a conscience when we speak." A well-to-do middle peasant said in a very agitated manner, "In the past, I had porridge in the morning, cake in the afternoon, and sometimes even boiled cake in the evening. Now we eat the same as 'pig feed.' If we're not fed enough, we can't increase production." This aroused resentment among everyone. The poor peasant Ye Hongming immediately retorted, "Humph! You're just talking about yourselves. How many families were like yours in the past? We used to borrow one 'dou' [a unit of volume] and return one and a half. After the new grain came out, how many 'dou' could we keep after repaying the loan?..." Everyone chimed in, and the argument became more and more intense. In the end, everyone agreed that if it weren't for the state's intervention, things would be even worse. Our area produces less grain, so we should eat less. Don't be envious of people in other places who eat 500 jin; how much do they contribute to the state? We don't sell surplus grain, we don't hand over public grain, and we still need supplies. We can't just keep asking the state for help.

Regarding the claim that cadres were making false reports, everyone also thought it was nonsense. If the reports were false, they wouldn't even be able to get the 540,000 jin of supplied grain.

### 工人吃粮并不比农民多

    工人吃粮并不比农民多
    山西省阳高县王官屯乡国光农业社在讨论人民内部矛盾的时候，有人提出一年三百八十斤留粮不够吃，干部说够吃了是做假报告。有人主张按工人的吃粮标准供应。有人说够吃了，不能成天喊不够吃。在争论不休的时候，大家当面算了一笔账：一户铁路工人六口人，本人一月供应量是四十六斤，全年五百五十二斤，五口家属按城市分人定量的供应标准，全年供应一千三百十六斤，加上职工本人全家全年供应量是一千八百六十八斤。一户农民以同等人口算了一下，每人三百八十斤，全家全年吃粮二千二百八十斤，比一家工人多吃四百一十二斤，平均每人比工人约多吃七十斤粮食。当时有的人说，城市供应是商品粮，咱们是粗粮，就又差的远啦。以后又按社里粮种分配比例折了一下，每个农民还比工人多吃四十七斤。算的结果，如果农民非劳动人口也按工人家属标准供应的话，而劳动人口就能吃到六百多斤。
    又有人说：“反正国家得管一管咱们的吃粮问题。”有人说：“谁说没有管呢？咱社供应的五十四万斤粮食那来的，说话嘛，不能没良心。”有一个富裕中农态度很不冷静的说：“我过去早上是粥，上午是糕，晚上有时还煮糕，现在吃的和‘猪饲料’一样，反正人哄地皮，地哄肚皮，不给往饱吃，就不能增产。”这一来引起了大家的反感，贫农叶宏明当时就驳斥：“哼！尽说你们，像你们过去那样有几户？我们过去装人一斗，还人斗半，新粮一上场，还了斗头能落几斗？……”你一言我一语，越吵越激烈，最后大家一致认为，要不是国家管，更没办法。咱们这地方打的粮少，就应该少吃，别看人家有的地方吃五百斤就眼红，人家对国家贡献多大？咱余粮不卖，公粮不交，还得供应，不能尽和国家伸手要。
    对于说干部有假报告的说法，大家也认为根本是瞎说，如果假报告，连五十四万斤供应粮也吃不上。　　　　　　　　　谢尚
