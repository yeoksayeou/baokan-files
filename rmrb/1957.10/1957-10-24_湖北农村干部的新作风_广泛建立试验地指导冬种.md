    New Working Style of Rural Cadres in Hubei
    Widely Establishing Experimental Plots to Guide Winter Planting
    Xinhua News Agency News: In many areas of Hubei Province, rural cadres are establishing experimental plots in winter sowing to promote advanced technologies through demonstrations. The cadres of the six hundred districts and townships in Hong'an County, who first created this experience, decided to continue establishing more than 2,000 mu of experimental plots in winter sowing. County and district cadres in Xiangyang Prefecture have already established more than 3,300 mu of experimental plots, averaging one-third of a mu per person; more than 62,000 township cadres and agricultural cooperative committee members have established more than 249,000 mu of experimental plots; in addition, production teams and youth and women's organizations have also launched collective experimental plots, totaling approximately 45,000 mu. The total area of experimental plots by cadres at all levels and collective units accounts for 2.6% of the total winter sowing area in the prefecture this year.
    These experimental plots adopt a variety of experimental activities according to the specific conditions of various places and agricultural cooperatives. Some are contracted by cadres from sowing to harvesting, while others are jointly experimented on by cadres, cooperative cadres, and members through consultation. In terms of experimental content, some focus on cultivating superior varieties, or conducting observational and comparative experiments on several different seeds, while others focus on promoting wheat strip planting, close planting, or on fertilization and soil improvement. Cadres meticulously cultivate their own experimental plots, selecting good seeds and applying sufficient base fertilizer. Some cadres also hold on-site visits and evaluations at the experimental plots, promptly introducing and promoting experience to the masses, and humbly listening to the opinions of old farmers on the experimental work.
    Leading cadres at all levels also take the lead in doing a good job in the experimental plots, studying technology from the production process and enriching their leadership experience. Han Yongchang, Secretary of the Sui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and thirteen county committee members who are often in the countryside, have respectively cultivated 15.5 mu of high-yield experimental plots in several townships. The unit yield of wheat is generally required to reach more than 500 jin to more than 1,000 jin. Cui Shoushen, Director of the Organization Department of the Gucheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Cai Yitian, a national agricultural labor model, jointly cultivated 4.5 mu of wheat experimental plots, using the cross-strip planting method, preparing to use half for cotton-wheat double cropping high-yield experiments and half for rice-wheat double cropping high-yield experiments after harvesting wheat next year. Xiao Linshan, Deputy County Head of Hong'an County, selected two mu of late japonica rice fields in Yangshan Third Cooperative in mountainous areas to cultivate high-yield wheat fields, immediately rushing to plant wheat after harvesting late japonica, exploring how to solve the contradiction between wheat and late japonica double cropping cultivation in mountainous areas, and seeking ways to achieve greater grain harvests in mountainous areas.

### 湖北农村干部的新作风  广泛建立试验地指导冬种

    湖北农村干部的新作风
    广泛建立试验地指导冬种
    新华社讯　湖北省许多地区的农村干部在冬播中建立试验地，通过示范来推广先进技术。最先创造这一经验的红安县六百多区乡干部，决定在冬播中继续建立二千多亩试验地。襄阳专区的县、区干部已经建立了三千三百多亩试验地，平均每人合三分地；乡干部和农业社社务委员六万二千多人，共建立试验地二十四万九千多亩；另外，生产队和青年、妇女组织也搞起集体的试验地，大约有四万五千亩。各级干部和集体单位的试验地总面积，占全专区今年冬播面积的2.6％。
    这种试验地根据各地和各农业社的具体情况，采取多种多样的试验活动。有些是由干部从种到收包干到底的，也有由干部和社干部、社员商定联合试验的。在试验内容方面，有的着重于培养优良品种，或就几种不同种籽进行观察比较的试验，也有以推行小麦条播、密植或在施肥、改良土壤等方面作为试验的重点。干部们对于自己搞的试验地，都是精耕细作，选好种籽，下足底肥。有些干部还在试验地举行现场的参观评比，及时向群众介绍、推广经验，并且虚心倾听老农民对试验工作的意见。
    各级领导干部也带头搞好试验地，从生产过程中钻研技术，丰富领导经验。中共随县委员会书记韩永昌和常在农村的十三个县委委员，分别在几个乡搞了十五亩半丰产试验地。小麦单位产量大都要求达到五百斤以上到一千多斤。中共谷城县委员会组织部长崔寿臣和全国农业劳动模范蔡以田合作搞了四亩半小麦试验地，采用交叉条播方法，准备明年收麦后一半作棉麦两熟丰产试验，一半作稻、麦两熟丰产试验。红安县副县长肖林山，在山区杨山三社的一季晚粳田里，选出二亩培育小麦丰产田，收割晚粳后马上抢种小麦，摸索如何解决山区小麦与晚粳两熟栽培的矛盾，寻求山区粮食更大丰收的途径。
