    Touring "Golden Sand Beach"
    The train speeding on the North Datong-Puzhou Railway stopped at Shangxizhuang Station in Daren County, Shanxi Province. Passengers curiously craned their necks to look out the windows. To the west were the Red Peach Mountains, shaped like a screen, rising and falling in layers. To the east, the Yellow Flower Ridge, with its sand dunes, faced the mountains from afar, lying prone. In between was a forty-li plain. People pointed to this stretch of land, saying it was the ancient battlefield of Jinshatan (Golden Sand Beach), a desolate place of flying sand and stones, where the generals of the Song Dynasty's Yang family, the Seven Heroes and Eight Tigers, fought against the Khitan (Liao Dynasty) armies, according to legend.
    We squeezed off the train, and our journey to the frontier began here.
    That evening, we settled down in the Third Work Township, the center of Jinshatan. A gust of wind blew in the middle of the night, but we slept peacefully with the windows open. This might not seem like much elsewhere, but in Jinshatan, it was nothing short of a miracle.
    The people living in Jinshatan described the desolate appearance of Jinshatan in the past. Back then, when the wind blew, sand and dust flew, the sky darkened, and all farm work stopped. Every household closed their doors and windows and lit lamps. The crops on the beach land, when hit by strong winds, were either blown away by the roots or buried by sand. Seeds were sown three or four times, but seedlings could not be secured. Local farmers painfully described those years as: "People walk on the roof; pigsties don't transport soil; no wind rises during the Beginning of Summer, but if wind does rise, it buries people!" "Seeds are sown in the daytime, and lost overnight!" In 1952, when trees were first planted here, bundles of saplings were placed in the fields, only to be completely buried by sand during a single night of wind.
    In the past, closing doors and windows couldn't stop the dust when the wind blew, but now opening windows doesn't bring dust when the wind blows. What's the reason? We found the same answer in Hujiazhai, which had endured the onslaught of wind and sand, in Rizhongcheng, and in Caozhuang, which was located on the edge of Yellow Flower Ridge: it was the result of six years of forest network construction. Because the trees controlled the dust and sand, the yellow wind became a clean breeze, and the wind force was also reduced. Ning Yu, the director of the Hujiazhai Zhonghua Agricultural Cooperative, said: Because of the protection of the field forest belt, seeds were sown in time this year, and the cultivated land began to be stabilized, resulting in the first good harvest in years. The village, historically short of grain, could have surplus grain this year. In the past, because the land could not be relied upon, most farmers made a living by peddling, or moved out with their families. Only eight households remained in the village. In recent years, the masses have seen that afforestation works, and they have slowly moved back to settle down, increasing the number of households to thirty-six. The Third Work Township has continuously reclaimed wasteland for farming in the past two years, and this year alone, it has restored abandoned cultivated land and reclaimed new wasteland amounting to 5,700 mu.
    Standing on the high ground of Yellow Flower Ridge, the forty-li-long landscape of Jinshatan is vividly visible. The entire beach land is woven into a green network by large forest belts about a hundred li long and several hundred meters wide around the perimeter, as well as rows of secondary forest belts running horizontally and vertically in the middle, together with the railway protection forests. There are a total of more than 30,000 mu of forest land on this beach. Looking from afar, clumps of small-leaf poplar trees form a dark, continuous expanse. As we stepped on the soft sand and walked through the rows of young forest belts, we couldn't help but recall the local farmers' proposal to rename this wasteland "Greened Beach."

        On the Banks of the Sanggan River
    In the morning, we passed through the Yellow Flower Ridge forest area and saw the Sanggan River shimmering in the sunlight from afar.
    Before coming here, we had heard that this river had a special character. It not only contained a lot of silt, threatening the lifespan of the Guanting Reservoir downstream, but also had a riverbed upstream that was higher than the ground, with crumbling banks and uncontrolled floods that frequently caused disasters. On the road, a comrade from the Sanggan River Afforestation Station, who was our guide, introduced us to the fact that the vast number of people along the river had been managing this river, which has fourteen tributaries, is 360-plus li long, and has a total drainage area covering more than 1,100 villages in ten counties, for the past five years. Protective forest belts tens of meters wide have appeared on both sides of the river. With this forest belt as a straight line, rows of secondary forest belts extend out like the wings of a wild goose. Due to the formation of protective works, the dilapidated riverbanks have been basically stabilized, and the fierce currents have been channeled. As we approached the riverbank, we saw trees more than two zhang high on the shore, turning the scattered river channel into a long belt in the oasis. The pontoon bridge was crowded with large carts loaded with coal and melons, waiting to cross the river, and pedestrians on the riverbank were bustling, presenting a scene of prosperity.
    Caoniang Village in Ying County, which used to suffer from the floods of the Sanggan River in the south and the wind and sand of Jinshatan in the north, was a notoriously poor village in history. When we visited door-to-door in the village, an old man named Wang Wenli told us that thirty years ago, in the autumn, his family's crops, which they had worked hard to cultivate, were about to be harvested, but they were all washed away by a ruthless flood. Since then, he sold his house and pawned his clothes, his wife lived with her parents, and he fled to outside the pass for more than nine years. It was not until after the land reform that he was allocated land and housing, and the couple was reunited. After collectivization, they once again had plenty to eat and wear. We visited farm households such as Qin Shiyi, Men Danv, Ci Peizhong, Liu Yong, and Qin Guantai, and they all had bitter experiences of suffering from river water or sandstorms. Some elderly people have suffered from the erosion of river water for a long time and still suffer from symptoms such as asthma and arthritis. Now, they generally have clean houses, enough food and coal, sets of new clothes and quilts, as well as daily necessities such as soap, toothbrushes, and thermos bottles that they had never seen before, and their lives are very different from the past.

        Pilgrimage to Daquanshan
    We set off from Yanggao County and headed south. The motorcycle bumped forward on a swampy beach covered with aquatic plants. The driver told us: This was the muddy and difficult beach that used to be called "Don't cross Yanmen Pass in winter, don't walk on Yanggao Beach in summer." Now the road has been built, and cars can go directly to Daquanshan.
    About an hour later, the motorcycle turned past a mountain called Camel Ridge, and we saw Daquanshan, which is famous throughout the country for its outstanding achievements in soil and water conservation.
    Receiving us was the famous labor model Gao Jincai, director of the Daquanshan Agricultural Cooperative. It was he and Zhang Fenglin who, for eighteen years, persisted in managing Daquanshan, fundamentally changing the appearance of this loess hill that had been eroded into thousands of holes and ravines. On this day, he led us through a shaded valley, along a babbling spring stream, and climbed to the main peak of Daquanshan. The surrounding hillsides were covered with dense fruit trees, and the deep gullies eroded by rainwater had been built into terraced valley dams. Gao Jincai pointed to the distant mountain peaks and said: These are Jinggou Ridge, Camel Ridge, and Sunjia Mountain, which began to be managed last year, and they are gradually becoming green. In just one year, 600 mu of terraced fields have appeared on the former desolate Dadongtai. The Danan Gully, which had been eroded by water for fifty years and was eight li long, has been built with valley dams and embankments this year, and crops have been planted for the first time, which is expected to increase production by more than 7,000 jin of grain. The contour lines of trees planted on the gully walls, extending from the top of the gully to the bottom, are growing very well. He specifically led us to visit a secluded mountain depression on the east side of Daquanshan, which was where he and Zhang Fenglin built soil and water conservation projects and planted trees eighteen years ago. Now the originally planted trees have grown into timber and have been felled for use. The second-generation forest is also as thick as a thigh and more than three zhang high.
    We talked to the members of the cooperative about the living conditions in Daquanshan. The members said: Daquanshan is very cold in winter, and even wearing cotton clothes and surrounding a fire can't keep out the cold. In the old society, except for landlords, rich peasants, and people who made money by driving carts, most people couldn't afford fur coats or cotton quilts. Now almost everyone, young and old, in the village has a fur coat, and every family has a floral quilt. Even Zhang Tianxing, an old man in his seventies who is "supported by the five guarantees," has made a floral flannel cotton quilt. These changes in life are sung in songs: "Daquanshan has three new treasures: floral quilts, uniforms, and big fur coats..."
    The experience of Daquanshan in comprehensively managing mountainous areas has spread all over the country. We saw two visitor signature books in the agricultural cooperative. From 1954 to the present, more than 34,000 people from fourteen provinces have come to visit. The hosts of Daquanshan not only enthusiastically introduce technical experience to the guests, but also accept the guests' suggestions, open training classes, and train soil and water conservation technicians, who are then sent to Henan Province, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and various parts of Shanxi Province to provide technical assistance and instruction. Last year, more than 200 new "Daquanshan" appeared in the Yanbei area, and this year, it is planned to train 500 more.

        Strolling Along the Great Wall
    The ancient Great Wall in northeastern Shanxi winds along Changcheng Mountain. The whistling wind from beyond the Great Wall spins and roars on the short walls. The world is hazy with dust and fog, and the river water begins to freeze, chilling people to the bone. Strolling along the Great Wall at this time, we can't help but think of the five-character poem "Frontier Ballad" by the Tang Dynasty poet Wang Changling: "Cicadas chirp in the empty mulberry forest, the Eighth Month at Xiao Pass. Leaving and entering the pass, it is cold, yellow reeds and grass everywhere. Travelers from the secluded wells, all grow old with dust and sand. Do not learn from the wandering heroes, boasting of fine purple horses."
    In the old days, natural disasters and man-made calamities made the area near the Great Wall in northeastern Shanxi the most desolate place. The floods that rushed down from the steep Great Wall mountains and the violent north wind with flying sand and stones destroyed countless villages, fields and houses. In addition, the reactionary ruling classes of past dynasties imposed heavy taxes and levies, and bandits wantonly looted. The farmers on the border were forced to the point where they had no way out, and batches of them took their children and old people to flee outside the pass. Those who remained in the village could not eat enough for half a year with the harvest of a year, so they had to rely on "running loads" to maintain their lives. In that era, the villages along the Great Wall did not hear chickens or dogs at night, and there was no smoke from cooking chimneys during the day. Large tracts of farmland were abandoned, and wild animals roamed in broad daylight...
    Now, the area along the Great Wall is a different scene: inside and outside the Great Wall, the ears of grain on terraced fields and slopes are drooping, sorghum and millet are full of grains, and golden sunflowers sway in the wind. In Zhuanlou Village, Yanggao County, which straddles the city walls, we saw crowds of people spreading out over fields of millet and grain, harvesting with sickles. On the main roads and small paths, rubber-wheeled carts and donkeys transporting crops were coming and going in an endless stream. The members of the cooperative told us: It is estimated that the average yield per mu of the whole cooperative this year will be 170 jin, which is a good year that has never happened in this place. The elderly say that in the past, the crops from thirty mu of land were not enough for one load!
    In the eight years since the founding of the People's Republic, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of the people in northeastern Shanxi, with heroic spirit, have carried out large-scale tree planting and afforestation, transforming barren and abandoned land, so that the natural appearance of this barren and desolate area has gradually changed. The largest project to transform the natural appearance of the Great Wall—greening Changcheng Mountain and building a Great Wall protection forest belt—has already begun from east to west in Tianzhen County, where it borders the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Hebei Province. When we traveled along the Great Wall line in northern Yanggao County, we saw many greened mountain peaks along the way, where water does not flow out of the gullies and soil does not go down the slopes. At the foot of the mountains, there are also green oases and rare paddy fields. The farmers of Zhuanlou Village, Yanggao County, who have done the best in soil and water conservation, have built more than 120 mu of terraced paddy fields in Erlong Gully. Terraced fields, slopes, and soil and water conservation projects have been built everywhere on the hillsides, and grape and apple trees have been planted everywhere. People are saying: In five years, this place will become a flower and fruit garden. (Xinhua News Agency special manuscript)

    塞上变迁
    冯健伟　杨义
    游“金沙滩”
    奔驰在北同蒲铁路的列车，停在山西省大仁县尚希庄车站，旅客们好奇地争着从窗口向外了望。这里西面像屏风形状、起伏层叠的红桃山峰，风沙堆积成丘的黄花梁与山峰遥遥相对，卧伏到东边，中间四十里平滩。人们指划着这片滩地说，这就是历史上飞沙走石、漫无人烟的塞上古战场金沙滩，相传宋朝杨家将七郎八虎大战番兵就在此地。
    我们挤下车来，塞上的旅行从这里开始了。
    当天晚上，我们落脚在金沙滩的中心第三作乡。半夜里刮起了一阵风，但是我们开着窗户睡得很安然。这在别的地方也许算不了什么，但是在金沙滩，就不能不说是奇迹了。
    生活在金沙滩上的人们，对我们描绘了过去金沙滩的荒凉面貌。那时刮起风来沙飞尘扬，昏天暗日，一切农活都停止了，家家关门闭户，点灯照明。滩地上的庄稼遇上大风，不是被连根吹走，就是叫沙土埋住。播种三、四次，都捉不住苗。当地农民痛苦地形容说，那些年月是：“人在房上走，垫圈不运土，立夏不起风，起风埋住人！”“白天播下种，一夜把种丢！”1952年这里开始栽树时，地里放下一捆捆的树苗，夜里一场风便全被沙土埋住了。
    过去一起风关门闭户挡不住尘土，现在刮风开窗户没尘土，这是什么缘故？我们在饱经塞外风沙袭击的胡家寨，在日中城和座落在黄花梁边的曹庄，得到了相同的答案：这是六年来营造林网的结果。因为树林制住了尘砂，黄风变成了清风，风力也减削了。胡家寨中华农业社主任甯钰说：因为护田林带的作用，今年及时播上种，开始固定了耕地，获得头一年好收成，历史上的缺粮村，今年可以余粮。过去由于土地指望不上，大多数农民靠担挑小贩谋生，或携家带口外迁，村里只留下八户。近几年来群众看到造林顶事，才慢慢迁回来安居，户数增加到三十六户。第三作乡最近两年连续开荒种地，光今年恢复弃耕地和新开荒地就有五千七百亩。
    站在黄花梁高处眺望，四十里长的金沙滩景象历历在目。四周有长约百里、宽几百公尺的大林带和中间横竖成行的副林带，把整个滩地编织成一张绿网，连同护铁路林，这块滩地上总共有三万多亩林地了。远远望过去，一丛丛的小叶杨树，黑压压连成一片。当我们踏着松软的砂地，穿过一道道幼林带的时候，不禁想起当地农民要把这片荒滩改名为绿化滩的话来。
        在桑干河畔
    早晨，我们穿过黄花梁林区，便遥遥望见在阳光下闪闪发光的桑干河。
    到这里以前，我们就听说这条河具有特殊性格。它不仅含泥沙多，威胁着下游官厅水库寿命。而且上游河床高出地面，河岸瘫痪无边，洪水横冲直撞，经常泛滥成灾。路上，给我们作向导的桑干河造林站的同志介绍说：沿河广大人民对于这条拥有十四条支流、全长三百六十多里，总流域面积占了十个县一千一百多个村庄的河流。已经进行了五年的治理，河两岸已出现几十公尺宽的防护林带；以这条林带为直线，伸展出一排排副林带，宛如雁翅一般。由于防护工事的形成，破烂的河岸基本上稳固了，凶猛的流水归了槽。我们临近河岸时，就看到岸边两丈多高的树林，使散乱的河道变成绿洲中的一条长带。浮桥旁拥挤着满载煤炭、瓜果，等待渡河的大车，河边上的行人熙熙攘攘，呈现一片繁荣景象。
    过去南受桑干河洪水危害、北受金沙滩风砂侵扰的应县曹娘村，是历史上出名的穷村。我们在村里逐门挨户去访问时，一个叫王文礼的老人告诉我们，三十年前的秋天，他一家辛勤作务的庄稼眼看快收割了，但被一场无情的洪水全部冲光。从此他卖房典衣，妻子寄食在娘家，他一个人逃难口外九年多，直到土地改革后，分了土地房屋，夫妻才重新团圆。合作化以后，又得到丰衣足食。我们到秦世义、门大女、次培忠、刘永、秦官太等农户作了访问，他们都有一段因遭受河水或风沙灾害的苦难经历。有的老年人长期受河水侵袭，至今还带着气喘、关节炎等病症。现在，他们普遍有了清洁的住宅，足够的吃食和煤炭，成套的新衣新被，还有过去根本没见过的香皂、牙刷、暖水瓶等日用品，生活跟过去大不相同了。
        大泉山巡礼
    我们从阳高县城出发南行。摩托车在一片长满水草的沼泽滩地颠簸前进。司机告诉我们：这是过去被称为“冬不过雁门关，夏不走阳高滩”的泥泞难行的滩地，现在公路已修成，汽车可以直通到大泉山。
    约摸一小时，摩托车转过一座名叫骆驼凹的山峰，迎面就看到了以水土保持的卓越成就而闻名全国的大泉山。
    接待我们的是著名劳动模范、大泉山农业社主任高进才。是他和张凤林一道，十八年来坚持治理大泉山，使这座被雨冲刷成千孔百洞、沟壑纵横的黄土山丘，从根本改变了面貌。这一天，他带领我们穿过一条林荫夹道的山沟，沿着流水潺潺的泉溪，攀登上大泉山主峰。山坡四周果树茂密，被雨水冲刷的深沟都修建成台阶式的谷坊。高进才指着远处的山头说：这是去年开始治理的井沟梁、骆驼凹、孙家山，现在也逐渐绿化了，旧日荒凉的大东台上，一年之间出现了六百亩梯田。五十年来流水冲刷成八里长的大南沟，今年修上谷坊埝地，首次种上了农作物，预计可以增产七千多斤粮食。沟壁上造的水平线林，从沟顶一直排到沟底，长的很出色。他特意引我们参观了大泉山东面一处僻静的山洼，这是他和张凤林在十八年前修建水土保持工程和植树造林的地方。现在原栽的树已经长大成材，砍伐使用了，第二代林也有大腿粗、三丈多高了。
    我们和社员们谈论起大泉山的生活情形。社员们说：大泉山冬天很冷，穿棉衣围火炉都顶不住。旧社会除了地主、富农等有钱人和赶车出口外的人以外，一般人都穿不起皮袄，盖不上棉被。现在村里青壮老年差不多人人有皮袄，家家有了花铺盖，连七十多岁的“五保户”张天兴老汉，也作了一床花哔叽棉被。这些生活变化，被人们当作歌谣唱着：“大泉山新添三件宝：花被、制服、大皮袄……”
    大泉山全面治理山区的经验遍传各地。我们在农业社里看到了两本来客签名簿。从1954年到现在，先后有来自十四个省的三万四千多人来参观。大泉山的主人不仅热心地为客人介绍技术经验，还接受客人们的建议，开办训练班、培养水土保持技术员，然后派到河南省、内蒙古自治区和山西省各地进行技术帮助和传授。去年雁北地区已经出现了新的“大泉山”二百多个，今年还计划培养五百个。
        长城漫步
    晋东北古老的长城顺着长城山蜿蜒相连。由塞外吹来的飒飒寒风，在短墙上打着旋转呼啸，天地间尘雾迷蒙，河水开始结冰，使人冷彻骨髓。我们在这时漫游长城，不由想起唐朝诗人王昌龄“塞上曲”五言诗：“蝉鸣空桑林，八月萧关道。出塞入塞寒，处处黄芦草。从来幽井客，皆共尘沙老。莫学游侠儿，矜夸紫骝好。”
    在旧时代，天灾人祸使得晋东北长城附近一带成了一个最荒凉的地方。从那陡峭的长城山上冲下来的洪水，飞沙走石的塞北暴风，不知摧毁了多少庄田和房屋。加以历代反动统治阶级横征暴敛，土匪肆意劫夺。塞边农民被逼迫得走头无路，成批成批的携幼扶老出口外逃难。留在村里的人，一年收的不够半年吃，只好靠“跑驮子”维持生活。那时代，长城沿线的村里夜不闻鸡犬，昼不见炊烟，大片的耕地荒芜废弃，野兽白昼出没……
    现在，长城沿线却是另一番景象：长城内外梯田、坡地上谷穗低垂，高粱和黍子颗粒饱满，金葵花随风摇曳。我们在横夸城墙的阳高县砖楼村，看到谷田黍地遍布掌镰收割的人群，大路小道上运送庄稼的胶皮轮大车和驴驮，络绎不绝。社员们告诉我们：今年全社预计平均亩产一百七十斤，是这个地方从来没有过的好年景，老年人说在过去，三十亩地的庄稼还不够一驮子驮呢！
    建国八年来，晋东北的广大人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，以英雄的气概，大规模地植树造林，改造荒田废地，使得这个贫瘠荒凉的地区的自然面貌逐渐改变了。改造长城自然面貌的最大工程——绿化长城山，营造长城防护林带，已经从与内蒙古自治区和河北省交接处的天镇县由东向西开始。我们在阳高县北部长城线上旅行时，沿途看到许多绿化了的山头，已经是水不出沟、土不下坡。山脚下也出现一片片绿洲和稀有的水田。水土保持工作做得最好的阳高县砖楼村农民们已在二龙沟修成一百二十多亩梯田水地，山坡上遍修梯田、坡地和水土保持工程，处处栽上了葡萄苹果树。人们都说：五年以后这里就会变成花果园。　（新华社专稿）
