Great Debate Brings New Atmosphere

    Harvesting Autumn Crops in the Rain, Building Water Conservancy Projects
    Chengjiang Farmers Overcome the Mentality of Waiting for Heaven's Favor

    (Reported by our newspaper) Farmers in Chengjiang County, Yunnan Province, overcame the mentality of waiting for favorable weather through great debate, actively engaging in the autumn harvest and building water conservancy projects even in the rain.

    Before the beginning of October, the weather was consistently overcast and rainy. In twenty days, only 25% of the autumn harvest had been completed in the entire province, and some of the millet had already sprouted. The idea of passively waiting for the weather to improve was criticized in the great debate. Since the 12th, with the support of more than 8,000 cadres and students, the county's farmers have been working day and night to rush the harvest. In less than a week, all the ripened millet has been harvested. In the past, this would have taken at least twenty days. Previously, one threshing team (seven people) could only thresh 20 to 30 bundles of millet per day; now they have increased this to 40 to 50 bundles, with the highest reaching 57 bundles. Waste has also been reduced compared to the past.

    To prevent drought, farmers are also building water conservancy projects in the rain while harvesting autumn crops. For example, the Guanglong Cooperative has raised two pond dams and repaired five reservoir ponds. The increased water storage can irrigate more than 1,000 mu of farmland.

### 冒雨秋收　兴修水利  澄江农民克服等天思想

    冒雨秋收　兴修水利
    澄江农民克服等天思想
    本报讯　云南省澄江县农民，通过大辩论克服了等天思想，积极投入秋收，并冒雨兴修水利。
    10月上旬以前，天气连日阴雨不晴，二十天中全省秋收只进行了25％，部分谷子已经出了芽。在大辩论中批判了坐待天气的思想，12日起，在八千多名干部、师生的支援下，全县农民日夜投入抢收。不到一星期，已成熟的谷子即全部收割完毕。如果在过去，至少需要二十天。过去，一张掼盆（七个人）一天只掼二十到三十挑谷子，现在提高到四十到五十挑，最高的达到五十七挑，浪费也比以前减少。
    为了防止干旱，与秋收的同时，农民还冒雨兴修水利。如广龙社已加高了两个塘坝，整修了五个坝塘，增加的蓄水，可多灌田一千余亩。
