Xinhua News Agency report: Shanxi Province's agricultural leading departments are streamlining administrative organs and actively improving their work in the rectification movement.

Shanxi's agricultural system originally had four departments: agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and soil and water conservation. In the past, each had its own large leadership organization, and the internal personnel of the agencies were cumbersome. After repeated research and solicitation of opinions from relevant departments during the rectification movement, the four departments have now been merged into one Agricultural Construction Department. This will save a total of more than 1,500 cadres. At present, most of these cadres have been decentralized to strengthen grassroots leadership.

With the changes in organizational structure, the practice of cadres from various departments going deep into the lower levels has gradually become a trend. In recent months, directors and heads of bureaus have generally gone to the countryside two to four times. After the streamlining of the Farm Management Office this year, there are fewer personnel than in the past. The cadres of the entire management office have gone to the countryside a total of 64 times, with those going to the countryside accounting for four-fifths of the total personnel, and the number of working days in the countryside has increased by more than 70% compared with the same period last year. According to the opinions of cadres, the Water Conservancy Bureau organized two engineering inspection teams led by two directors to inspect five key projects. After inspection, they discovered wasteful phenomena. After analyzing the reasons and re-formulating the plan, it is now possible to save more than 420,000 yuan initially.

Before the launch of the rectification movement, the agricultural system in Shanxi Province had many official documents, and the signing and printing were not timely. During the rectification period, the leaders of the departments immediately divided the scope of document drafting and issuance and simplified the signing procedures based on the opinions expressed in the "blooming and contending." In order to frequently listen to the opinions of the masses, each department has set up special personnel to handle letters from the masses or receive visitors, and at the same time established an inspection system.

    山西农业系统四个部门合并
    一千五百多干部充实基层
    据新华社讯　山西省农业领导部门在整风运动中紧缩行政机构，积极改进工作。
    山西农业系统原有农业、林业、水利、水土保持等四个部门，过去各有一套较大的领导机构，机关内部人员庞杂。整风运动中经过反复研究和征求各有关部门的意见，现在把四个部门合并成为一个农业建设厅。这样共可节省一千五百多个干部。目前这些干部绝大部分都下放，充实基层领导。
    随着组织机构的改变，各部门干部深入下层也逐渐形成风气。最近几个月中，厅、局长已普遍下乡两次到四次。农场管理处今年精简机构以后，人员比过去少了，整个管理处的干部共下乡六十四次，下乡人员占人员总数的五分之四，下乡工作日比去年同时期增加了70％以上。水利局根据干部的意见，组织了两个工程检查小组，由两个处长率领检查五项重点工程。经过检查，他们发现了浪费现象，经过分析原因、重新拟定计划，现在初步可以节约四十二万多元。
    整风运动开展以前，山西省农业系统公文很多，而且签发打印不及时。整风期间，厅领导上根据鸣放中的意见，立即划分了公文拟发范围和简化签发手续。为了经常听取群众意见，各部门都设立专人处理群众来信或接待来访，同时建立了检查制度。（附图片）
