According to Zhejiang Daily news: Recently, the expanded meeting of the Pujiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Zhejiang Province determined the local policy of actively developing water conservancy construction through debate and revised the water conservancy work plan for this winter and next spring. After the meeting, the county party committee has taken measures to lead various places to actively carry out the water conservancy construction movement, demanding that a surge of water conservancy construction be set off throughout the county.

At the meeting, when discussing and determining the water conservancy construction policy, there were two different opinions. One was that the county's water conservancy had been almost completed in the past few years. If a large amount of construction were to be carried out again, the farmers would not be able to bear it and it would affect production. Therefore, water conservancy construction should focus on consolidation. The other opinion was that although water conservancy construction already has a certain foundation, it still cannot meet the needs of developing production, and it must continue to be built in large quantities while consolidating. Should we consolidate or develop? The meeting launched a debate on this issue.

It is Not That Too Much Has Been Built, But That Too Little Has Been Built

The first issue of the debate was: Has the county's water conservancy project been built too much or too little? The facts are as follows: In the past few years since liberation, the county's water conservancy construction has indeed achieved great results. The county has built 240 reservoirs, more than 20,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, and more than 2,800 flood control projects, investing more than 4.76 million workdays. As a result, the amount of water stored has increased to more than 19 million cubic meters, and the average drought resistance capacity has increased from 10 days before liberation to about 25 days. The disaster-prone Pujiang River also did not pose a danger at the 64-meter alert water level. However, the county still has more than 124,500 mu of farmland (accounting for 46% of the paddy field area) with drought resistance capacity of less than 20 days. These fields are threatened by varying degrees of drought every year, and more than 50,000 mu of farmland are vulnerable to flooding. This autumn, more than 90,000 mu of land in more than 30 townships suffered varying degrees of drought. Looking at the amount of water needed for production, according to surveys and reconnaissance, to basically eliminate ordinary drought in the county, a total of 45.07 million cubic meters of water is needed, while the current storage capacity is only 19.1 million cubic meters. After this analysis and debate, everyone believed that the county's water conservancy was not overbuilt, but still insufficient.

Water Conservancy Occupies Land, But Grain Production Can Increase

The second question was: Can building more water conservancy develop production or will it hinder production? Some people think that "building more reservoirs will occupy land and reduce grain production." The meeting made a detailed calculation for the whole county: In the past few years, the county has occupied 3,600 mu of land due to water conservancy construction. Calculated at 400 jin of grain per mu, the county has reduced grain output by 1.44 million jin. Building reservoirs has indeed reduced some grain output due to the occupation of some land. However, from 1949 to 1956, the county did not reduce production but increased grain production by more than 80 million jin, so the increase in production cannot be separated from the large-scale construction of water conservancy. Therefore, building water conservancy is precisely to develop agricultural production, which is dominated by grain. The practice of using part of the land to obtain more grain is completely correct. The problem in the future is to expand water conservancy while cherishing land and conscientiously implementing the policy of "small loss, large gain."

The County's Farmers Have Enough Labor to Build Water Conservancy

The third question was: Can farmers afford it? The focus of the debate was on the issue of labor. This winter, the county originally planned to invest 1.13 million workdays in water conservancy. Some comrades thought that this plan was too large. However, comparing this figure with the labor input in previous years and the existing labor potential in rural areas will solve the problem. From the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, the county invested 1.9 million workdays in water conservancy, and that year the construction was only fully started in December. This year, construction started in October, and it is expected to end by the end of February next year, with five months. Excluding rainy and snowy idle days, the county's 140,000 male and female full and semi-labor forces can still work 12 million workdays (semi-labor forces are converted into full labor forces), and the number of workdays invested in water conservancy only accounts for 9.4% of the total. Therefore, in the whole county, farmers have enough labor to build water conservancy.

After debating the above issues, the comrades attending the meeting unanimously agreed that future water conservancy work must implement the policy of "focusing on drought prevention and taking into account flood control," and actively, steadily, and massively carry out construction.

    批判错误意见　统一干部认识
    浦江经过辩论决定大兴水利
    据浙江日报消息　最近，中共浙江浦江县委扩大会议经过辩论确定了当地积极发展水利建设事业的方针，并修订了今冬明春的水利工作计划。会后，县委已采取措施领导各地积极开展兴修水利运动，要求在全县掀起修水利热潮。
    会议在讨论确定水利建设方针的时候，有两种不同的意见，一种是，认为几年来全县水利已经修得差不多了，如果再要大量兴修，农民不能负担，并会影响生产，因此，水利建设应该以巩固为主。另一种是，认为水利建设虽已有一定基础，但仍不能满足发展生产的需要，必须在巩固的同时，继续大量兴修。到底是巩固还是发展？会议对这一问题开展了辩论。
    不是修得多了而是修得少了
    辩论的第一个问题是：全县的水利工程修多了还是太少了？事实是这样：解放几年来，全县水利建设成绩确实很大，全县兴建了水库二百四十座，小型农田水利二万余处，防洪工程二千八百余处，投用四百七十六万多工，结果，蓄水量增加到一千九百多万公方，平均抗旱能力由解放前的十天提高到二十五天左右，多灾的浦阳江也在六十四公尺的警戒水位不出危险。但是，全县尚有十二万四千五百多亩农田（占水田面积46％）抗旱能力在二十天以下，这些田每年都要受到不同程度的干旱威胁，还有五万多亩农田易受洪水侵袭。今年秋天，就有三十多个乡九万多亩土地受到了不同程度的旱灾。再从生产需要的水量来看，根据调查勘察，要在全县范围内基本上消灭普通旱灾，共需水量四千五百零七万公方，而现在的蓄水量仅一千九百十万公方。这样分析辩论之后，都认为全县的水利不是修多了，而是还不够。
    水利占用土地  粮食却能增产
    第二个问题是：多修水利能发展生产还是会妨碍生产？有的认为
  “多修了水库，占用了土地，粮食产量就会减少”。会议算了全县的一笔细账：几年来，全县由于修水利占用了土地三千六百亩，以每亩产粮四百斤计算，少收了粮食一百四十四万斤，修水库确实因占用一部分土地少收了一些粮食。可是，从1949年到1956年，全县没有减产还增产了粮食八千多万斤，所以能增产，与大量的兴修水利是分不开的。因此，修水利正是为了发展以粮食为主的农业生产，用去一部分土地而获得更多的粮食的做法是完全正确的，今后的问题是在于既要扩大水利，又要珍惜土地，认真贯彻“损失小，收益大”的方针。
    全县农民劳动力  足够兴修水利用
    第三个问题是：农民能不能负担？辩论的焦点是在劳动力的问题上。今冬，全县原计划在水利上投放劳力一百十三万工，有的同志认为这个计划太大。可是把这个数字和历年劳力投放及农村现有劳动潜力比较一下，问题也就解决了。1955年冬到1956年春，全县水利投放劳力一百九十万工，而那一年是在12月份才全面开始施工的，今年提前在10月开始施工，预计到明年2月底结束，有五个月时间，除去雨雪闲工，全县十四万男女整半劳力还能出工一千二百万工（半劳力折为整劳力算），投放水利出工数仅占总数的9.4％。因此，在全县来说，农民兴修水利劳力是足够的。
    经过对上述问题的辩论，到会同志一致认为今后的水利工作，必须贯彻“防旱为主，兼顾防洪”的方针，要积极稳步，大量兴修。
