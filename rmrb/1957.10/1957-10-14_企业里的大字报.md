    Rapidly Simplify Management Structures
    Our factory's management structure is bloated, with redundant personnel, resulting in a significant waste of the country's cadres and salaries. In a factory with fewer than two thousand people, management cadres and welfare staff number as many as four hundred and ninety-eight, accounting for 33.2% of the factory's production workers. I hope that through rectification, the administrative management structure will be rapidly streamlined.
    I propose the following concrete plan: I believe that the General Affairs Section, Welfare Section, Secretary's Office, and Health Station should be merged to form an Administrative Affairs Management Section, because the work of these four sections/offices is fundamentally inseparable. The Wage Section and Planning Section can also be merged, because the main responsibilities of the Wage Section, such as setting quotas, promoting advanced experience, and organizing labor competitions, should all be reflected in the production plan. The Security Section and Personnel Section should also be merged. The Administrative and Technical Management Research Group should be merged with the Business Section and renamed the Production Technology Section, to strengthen the factory's very important technology management work. Currently, the research group's work focuses on administrative management, which can be directly overseen by the factory director in the future. The Laboratory should be placed under the leadership of the Technical Supervision Section, and I suggest appropriately strengthening the Technical Supervision Section to undertake the inspection of materials and semi-finished products. Considering the nature of a printing enterprise, is a Mechanical and Power Section necessary? Because we are not a mechanical industry, I suggest that the drafting work of the Mechanical and Power Section should be assigned to the Repair and Manufacturing Department, and the machine maintenance should be done by each workshop itself. The ink group of the Repair and Manufacturing Department should be placed under the leadership of the Materials Section. What relationship does ink have with repair and manufacturing work? However, the relationship between ink and the Materials Section is very close in terms of material supply and sales.
    If the leadership agrees to study or adopt the above plan, then a large number of management personnel will inevitably be freed up. What should be done? I suggest that they take turns going down to the workshops to directly participate in workshop production management and labor.

    Why Not Reduce Leading Cadres?
    After the company merged, the Finance Section had four section chiefs. Due to the small amount of work and the large number of people, the section chiefs divided the work, but still one section chief had nothing to do. Li Section Chief, who was in charge of the overall work of the Finance Section, was in charge of funds. There was nothing to do in the section, so he had to go to the work area to ask for money. This was something that a clerk could do well, but the section chief had to personally go. Why not streamline the section chief-level cadres who are idly sitting around when streamlining the organization?

    New Bottle, Old Wine
    The company discussed streamlining the organization in March of this year and decided to merge some sections and abolish others, but what was the result?
    1. The Planning Section and the Contract Section were merged and named the Planning and Business Section, but in fact, nothing changed. The two systems' businesses are not mixed, the three section chiefs are not related to each other, and the personnel have not been reduced.
    2. The Hygiene Section and the Management Section were merged and named the Administrative Hygiene Section. There are five section chiefs, and secretly an additional section chief's office was added. The personnel were not changed.
    3. The Education Section was nominally abolished, but now it seems that it has only changed its name. The school has a principal, the office has a director and deputy director, and there are staff members and clerks below.
    We believe that such streamlining can only be said to be a case of new bottle, old wine.

    Adding People When There Were Already Too Many
    Our laboratory has too many people and a large organization, but the amount of work each month is pitifully small. Each person works at most half a day each day, and the comrades are bored. The remaining time is spent chatting, and some even go to the park to pass the time. Not only does the leadership not solve the problem of too many personnel in the laboratory, but on the contrary, they sent three cadres who had returned from studying at the Construction Engineering Bureau to the laboratory. After these three comrades came to the laboratory, Wu Guanrong entered the Cement Group. There were few tasks and many people, and the group leader could not allocate work, so he had to review the already verified test results again. Tan Shengyi was assigned to the Second Work Area Test Group to do odd jobs. According to him, he finished them in one and a half hours each day. Comrade Jin Renzhong was assigned to the Third Work Area Test Group and was also idle all day long.
    They are all young men, why not let them do more work!

    Low Efficiency with Too Many People
    Our company has three managers and one chief engineer. The division of labor among the four is not clear enough, so sometimes a report has to be written with the titles of all four leaders. As a result, it is passed around, and a circle is drawn with each hand. By the time it is all drawn, the problem may not be solved, but a lot of time has been wasted. This phenomenon shows that having many people is not a way to improve work efficiency. Now we are vigorously streamlining the organization. Shouldn't the leadership first consider this from their own level?
    The company has eight sections, two offices, one team, and one warehouse. The organization cannot be considered small, but who is in charge of the construction organization design, who buys the plasticizer, and who provides guidance to the foremen? Who formulates the company's safety measures? A large organization does not necessarily do more things, and some things are left unattended.

    Streamlining the Organization Like This
    The company started the work of streamlining the staffing in March and prepared to finish it in one month, and a streamlining office was specially established. But this work has not been finished yet. In the midst of streamlining the staffing, the staffing of the Materials Section has not only not been streamlined, but has been steadily increasing. The Materials Section originally had more than fifty people, and seventeen more were transferred in during the streamlining period. Due to the increase in personnel in the Materials Section, more than one thousand yuan is spent each month, and more than ten thousand yuan is spent annually. The leadership always says that the Materials Section is losing money. How can it not lose money like this? Please let the leadership carefully check the principles of streamlining the staffing!

    迅速简化管理机构
    我们厂管理机构臃肿，人浮于事，大大地浪费了国家的干部和工资。不到二千人的工厂，管理干部和福利工作人员竟达四百九十八人，占全厂生产工人的33.2％。希望通过整风，迅速紧缩行政管理机构。
    我提出下列一个具体方案：我认为总务科、福利科、秘书室和保健站应合并成立行政事务管理科，因为这四个科、室的工作根本无法分开。工薪科和计划科也可以合并，因为工薪科的主要职责如定额、推广先进经验、组织劳动竞赛等工作，都应该体现到生产计划上。保卫科与人事科也应该合并，行政技术管理研究组应和业务科合并，改名生产工艺科，以加强全厂十分重要的工艺管理工作。目前研究组的工作重点是研究行政管理，这一工作将来可由厂长直接负责。化验室应划归技术监督科领导，并建议适当加强技术监督科的力量，把材料和半制品的检验工作做起来。机械动力科，就印刷企业的性质来看是否可以不要，因为我们不是机械工业，因此我建议机动科的工作绘图部分应划给修制部去做，机器修养等工作由各车间自己做就行了；修制部的油墨组应划归物资科领导，做油墨同修制工作有什么关系呢，可是油墨与物资科的关系从材料供应上出售上都很密切。
    如果领导同意研究或者是采纳上述方案，那末，必然会多出很大一批管理人员，怎么办呢？我建议轮流下车间直接去参加车间生产管理工作和参加劳动。

    为什么不减领导干部？
    公司合并后，财务科有四个科长，由于事少人多，科长分工，分来分去还是有一个科长无事可作。分工后领导财务科全面工作的李科长，管资金，科里无事，只好去工区要钱，这本是个办事员就可以作好的事，而偏偏要科长亲自出马。为什么紧缩机构科长级干部窝工就不紧缩紧缩呢？

    换汤不换药
    公司在今年3月份讨论了紧缩机构，曾决定有的科室合并，有的科室取消，而结果呢？
    1、计划科与合同科合并命名为计划业务科，事实仍是原摊不动，两个系统业务各不相混，三个科长互不相关，人员也未减少。
    2、卫生科与管理科合并起名为行政卫生科。科长五人，暗中又增加个科长室，人员也未动。
    3、教育科名义上是取消了，可是现在来看只是换了个名字而已。校有校长，处有正副主任，下有干事、办事员。
    我们认为，如此紧缩，只能说是换汤不换药。

    本来人多还给加人
    我室人员多，机构大，而每月的工作量却少得可怜。每人每天工作时间最多半天，同志们闲得难受，剩下的时间有的聊天，有的甚至蹓公园去消磨时间。领导上不但不给试验室解决人员过多问题，相反的又把从建工局学习回来的三位干部送进试验室，这三位同志来到试验室后，武冠蓉进了水泥组，事少人多，组长无法分配工作，只好将已核定的试验结果再给他审核一遍。谭生义分配到二工区试验组作零碎工作，据他自己说每天一个半小时就干完了。金仁中同志分配到三工区试验组，也是整天无所事事。
    他们都是青年小伙子，为什么不让多做些工作呢！
　　　　　　　　      北京市第二建筑工程公司　记言
    人多效率低
    咱们公司有三位经理，一位主任工程师，四人之间分工不够明确，所以有时一个呈文上去必须写全四位领导人的头衔，结果转来转去，过一个手画一个圈儿，等到都画完了问题不一定解决了，可是日子费的不少。这种现象说明人多并不是提高工作效率的办法。现在正在大力紧缩机构，领导上是否先从本身这一层考虑一下呢？
    公司有八科二室一队一库，组织不能算小，但是试问施工组织设计归谁管，塑化剂由谁买，工长的业务由谁指导？公司的安全措施由谁制订？机构大了并不见得多办事，反而有些事情没人管了。
　　　　      北京市房地产管理局修建公司  郭树声
    如此紧缩机构
    公司从3月份就开始紧缩编制的工作，并准备一个月结束，又专门成立了整编办公室。可是到现在这个工作还未结束。就在紧缩编制声中，材料科的编制不但没有紧缩，反而源源增加。材料科原有五十余人，就在紧缩编制期间，又调进了十七名。材料科由于人员增加；每月多开支千余元，全年就得一万余元。领导上总说材料科赔钱，这样下去哪能不赔钱呢？请领导很好的检查一下紧缩编制的原则吧！
