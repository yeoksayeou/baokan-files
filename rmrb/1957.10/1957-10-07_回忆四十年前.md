    Recollections of Forty Years Ago
    Ba Ge Dan Nuo Fu
    Editor's Note: Comrade Lie Yi Ba Ge Dan Nuo Fu, the author of this article, is an old worker from Leningrad. He participated in revolutionary work very early. After the February Revolution, he joined the Workers' Red Guards. During the October Revolution, he was in the center of the revolutionary struggle, Petrograd, and served in the Smolny Palace garrison. In 1918, he joined the Russian Communist Party and fought on the Southern Front during the Civil War, defending the young Soviet regime. Here is an excerpt from his memoirs.

    One
    1917... In the Sestroretsk arms factory, workers were mobilized by the Tsarist government for "defense." In this factory, which belonged to the military department, anyone who attempted to spread revolutionary ideas among the workers would be immediately arrested and sent to military service.

    At that time, the factory operated in three shifts. The fine system was very strict, and fines were imposed at every turn: fines for disagreeing with the foreman, fines for singing, and fines for not attending prayers during factory holidays.

    Workers at that time had no idea what a "cultural palace," "club," or "gymnasium" was, and there wasn't even a cafeteria. Every lunch break, workers would send apprentices to small shops to buy some black bread and some unappetizing sausage, and then eat it next to their lathes.

    One day, the workers heard that the February Revolution had begun. Everyone immediately stopped working, sang revolutionary songs, and marched into the streets of Sestroretsk with red flags. The workers arrested the factory director and local officials and raised the red flag on the roof of the state organs.

    It was during these days that the factory Red Guards were established. The first task assigned to the Red Guards was to find the hidden Tsarist gendarmes and send them to the proletarian court for trial. We completed this task very well.

    On April 3rd, news of Lenin's return from abroad quickly spread from Petrograd to here. This day was a holiday, and the factory Party committee decided to organize two or three hundred workers to go to the White Island station to welcome Comrade Lenin, the leader and teacher of our Party.

    Several hours before the train arrived, a delegation of Petrograd workers also came to the station, including Lenin's sister, Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova. After the train entered the station, we saw Lenin standing at the door of the fifth carriage of a third-class car. At this time, the band played "The Marseillaise." The workers shouted "Hurrah!" and "Long live Comrade Lenin!"

    Comrade Lenin took off his peaked cap and greeted everyone. When he got off the train, the workers immediately lifted him up. At the station, Comrade Lenin gave a brief speech, congratulating the workers on overthrowing the Tsarist government. He said that the revolution was not over and that the power of the landlords and capitalists should be overthrown to carry out the socialist revolution.

    On July 4, 1917, the workers of the Sestroretsk arms factory, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party organization, marched into the streets with the slogan "All power to the Soviets!" The workers also sent a delegation to Petrograd, demanding that the capital's workers' and peasants' representatives' Soviet drive out the bourgeois government and take over all power.

    At that time, the factory Party organization had received news from Petrograd that the Provisional Government had decided to send a search team to confiscate the weapons of the Red Guards. We then had nearly two thousand rifles and several machine guns. The workers hid the weapons in the forest on the other side of Lake Razliv before the search team arrived.

    On the evening of July 10, the city of Sestroretsk, especially the arms factory, was tightly surrounded by the Provisional Government's search team. At seven o'clock the next morning, the leader of the search team summoned all the workers and announced that all weapons and ammunition must be handed over within twelve hours. That afternoon, the workers handed over some old muskets, shotguns, and sabers. The search team, seeing that it had not achieved its goal, began searching workers' homes. The members of the factory committee, headed by the Bolshevik Comrade Voskov, were arrested. The workers declared a strike in protest, and the arrested comrades were finally released.

    In October 1917, our Red Guards received a glorious task: the military group of the Russian Social Democratic Party's Sestroretsk Committee ordered the Red Guards to go to Petrograd to help the capital's proletariat prepare for an armed uprising.

    At twelve o'clock on the evening of October 24th, a Red Guard consisting of seven hundred people arrived at the Smolny Palace. The Revolutionary Military Committee ordered it to occupy Suvorov Street, the power plant, and the waterworks.

    Later, we received orders to occupy the Inzhenerny Castle and drive out the cadets of the Provisional Government from there. With the cooperation of the Red Guards of the Vyborg District, we attacked Marsovo Field behind a fortress made of firewood, and finally broke into the Inzhenerny Castle and disarmed the cadets.

    The scene in October 1917 is unforgettable. The sound of machine guns "rat-tat-tatting" and the constant gunfire formed the symphony of the revolution. The air was filled with the scent of revolution, and a great revolutionary achievement was being created and born.

    Three

    One night in February 1918. The siren of the Sestroretsk factory suddenly sounded, and people panicked. The Red Guards took up their guns, loaded ammunition on the road, and ran to the factory. A mass meeting was held in the factory courtyard, and Comrade Voskov, chairman of the factory committee, announced that the Germans were attacking Petrograd and called on the workers to take up arms against our common enemy and defend the Soviet regime.

    Workers and Red Guards enthusiastically responded to this call, and by nine o'clock the next morning, a team of six hundred people had been organized.

    A few days later, our team received orders to go to the second floor of the Smolny Palace to provide security, and our guard post was not far from Lenin's office.

    One day, around two o'clock in the middle of the night, those of us who were not on duty were awakened by the "Take up arms!" command. After we were ready, we were taken to the hall of the Smolny Palace, the revolutionary headquarters, which was already packed with people, with no place to stand. The hall suddenly became quiet. After a while, shouts of "Hurrah!" resounded throughout the columned hall. At this time, Comrade Lenin walked in, followed by Sverdlov, Dzerzhinsky, and several other comrades. When Lenin quickly walked onto the stage, people jumped up with joy, cheering and applauding their beloved leader.

    After the applause subsided, Lenin delivered a speech: the October Revolution was facing a serious threat, the Germans had already occupied Pskov and were advancing towards Petrograd. He called on us to defend the socialist motherland.

    On this night, all the teams were separated according to the battle lines. Our Red Guards were sent to Finland, where the Finnish "White Guards" were preparing to attack Petrograd. After leaving the Smolny Palace, we took a passenger train to the Lautta station from the Finland Station. Gunfire was intense here, and bullets pierced the wooden planks of the carriages. After we dispersed under the track, we saw the sailors who had arrived here three days ago to guard the railway. We only saw the traces of the night battle after dawn. Dead Finnish enemy soldiers in white clothes lay on the snow.

    With artillery support, we waded through waist-deep snow and drove the enemy back to Finland.

    In the most difficult days of our country in the spring of 1918, Lenin called on the workers of Petrograd to go to the countryside to help the poor peasants fight the rich peasants and collect grain. At that time, the grain problem was a fundamental issue for the victory of the revolution. The Red Guards of our factory responded to the Party's call and went to the south, to Tambov Oblast, Inzhavinsky, and Kirsanov, to collect grain from the rich peasants. The collected grain was loaded onto trains and transported to Moscow and Petrograd to help the workers in a state of starvation. In completing this task of the Party, we encountered armed resistance from the rich peasants and had to engage in armed struggle.

    As early as June 1917, the so-called "Military Government" was established in the Don region, which represented the interests of the landlords and wealthy Cossacks. This "government" was hostile to the October Revolution. The Don region became a concentration camp for counter-revolutionaries. In November 1917, White Army General Alekseyev also established the "Volunteer Army."

    On the Southern Front, our Eighth Army and the adjacent Ninth Army were stationed in the north of the Don region. After the battle began, we inserted ourselves on both sides of the Don, pushing Krasnov's White Guard Cossacks towards the Tenth Army, and then began a fierce battle against the enemy.

    What was the situation like at that time? First of all, it should be explained that there was no fixed front line in southern Russia during the entire Civil War. At that time, there was no air force except for individual aircraft. Our means of transportation were carts in the summer and sleds in the winter. When we were fighting on the front line, delegations of workers from Petrograd and Moscow often came to visit us, which were the happiest days in our combat life.

    Five

    In February 1919, I was transferred from the Southern Front back to Moscow to study at the Red Infantry Commanders' Training Course. This was very difficult for us workers' and peasants' children. What cadets used to learn in two years, we had to learn in six months, because the various fronts urgently needed their own red commanders.

    Most of the teachers here were officers of the former Tsarist army, some were colonels, and some were even generals. These people fundamentally hated the Soviet regime and were hostile to us "children of cooks." But in order to obtain food rations, they had to hide this feeling.

    At the school, we suggested to the training course committee to invite Comrade Lenin to give a lecture. Although Comrade Lenin was very busy, he came to the training course more than once to talk to us. Once, fifteen hundred people gathered on the parade ground, and Lenin gave a brief speech, talking about the international situation and the domestic situation. Lenin's speech had no manuscript, but it was very vivid and sharp. He walked back and forth while speaking and often used gestures. At the end of each speech, he always called on us to master military knowledge to strike at the enemy.

    On October 4, 1919, Yudenich's White bandit army began to attack Petrograd. All adults aged eighteen to forty in Petrograd were mobilized. Teams of troops marched to the front. Trenches crisscrossed the city, and cannons and machine guns were set up in the streets and alleys. Factory buildings became defensive points, and fortresses were built in the streets. October 17th to 22nd was the most serious juncture in the defense of Petrograd. The city Soviet called on the workers to contribute everything to defend this great city.

    At this time, the Revolutionary Military Committee estimated the emergency situation on the Northwest Front and decided to send students from the Moscow Red Commanders' Training Course to defend Petrograd. After fifteen hundred people arrived at their destination by car, they received ammunition and weapons and immediately rushed to the front, rushing to the Suergiyevo open-ground station on the Baltic Railway.

    Yudenich's White Army then occupied the Alexandrovka station, attempting to cut off the connection between Petrograd and Moscow. After we arrived at our destination, we immediately began a hand-to-hand battle with the enemy. The enemy far outnumbered us in terms of both numbers and equipment, but we also had our own advantages: this was revolutionary heroism and confidence in the inevitable victory of the revolutionary cause. What was particularly memorable in the battle was this: often after dusk, cars carrying armed workers from various factories in Petrograd came to the front. Regardless of hunger and fatigue, they lay side by side with us on the firing line to fight the enemy at night. The next morning, they settled the casualties and immediately returned to the factory to work.

    We continued to advance through the knee-deep mud and the freezing cold fog, leaving behind our wounded and dead comrades. On October 24th and 25th, we occupied the Red Village, and Yudenich led the fleeing soldiers to Katcheno.

    We came with fifteen hundred people, but only three hundred and fifty people returned to Moscow after the battle.

    In May 1920, I saw Comrade Lenin for the last time in Theater Square in Moscow and listened to his brief speech.

    After graduating from the training course in 1920, I went to the Finnish Gulf garrison troops as an artillery technician. In March 1921, I participated in the battle to suppress the Kronstadt counter-revolutionary rebellion. In the history of war, there has never been a case of taking down a naval fortress full of warships and located on an isolated island with infantry and artillery.

    The Red Army troops were divided into two teams, north and south, and began their first attack on Kronstadt on the evening of March 7. The decisive role in the attack was on the southern line. The southern line troops should directly take Kronstadt with the assistance of the artillery fortress "Red Hill." This aspect was commanded by Comrade Voroshilov. On the evening of March 16, the Red Army soldiers received the order to capture Kronstadt. Around two o'clock at night, we received white coats and stepped onto the ice of the Gulf of Finland from the direction of New Peterhof. Searchlights flashed from the fortress, and we immediately lay down on the ice and snow. Shells exploded the ice, and some of the attacking comrades fell into the water, but this did not stop the Red Army soldiers from advancing. Around six o'clock on the morning of March 17, the Red Army troops, led by Comrade Voroshilov, rushed into the Kronstadt fortress with "carbines" in their hands. Street fighting began.

    On the morning of March 18, Kronstadt was completely captured! From then on, the Soviet state stepped onto the period of peaceful construction. The socialist motherland is becoming stronger and more prosperous day by day.

    回忆四十年前
    巴格丹诺夫
    编者按　本文作者列·依·巴格丹诺夫同志是列宁格勒的一位老工人。他很早就参加了革命工作，二月革命后他参加了工人赤卫队，十月革命时他在革命斗争的中心彼得堡，并在斯莫尔尼宫担任过卫戍工作，1918年参加俄国共产党，内战时期作战于南方战线，保卫年青的苏维埃政权。这里是他的回忆录的片断。
    一
    1917年……。在歇斯特罗列茨克城的兵工厂，工人们被沙皇政府动员起来进行“防卫”。在这个属于军事部门的工厂里，任何一个企图在工人中间宣传革命思想的人马上会被抓起来，送去充军。
    当时工厂里分三班工作。罚金的制度非常严格，动不动就是罚钱：与工长意见不合要罚钱，唱歌要罚钱，在车间节日没去做祈祷要罚钱。
    那时的工人根本不知道什么是“文化宫”、“俱乐部”、“体育馆”，甚至连食堂也没有。每到午休的时候，工人便让学徒到小铺里买些黑面包和一些难吃的腊肠，然后就在车床旁边吃了起来。
    有一天，工人们听说二月革命开始了，大家马上停止了工作，唱起革命歌曲，举着红旗走到歇斯特罗列茨克的街道上。工人逮捕了厂方负责人和地方官吏，在国家机关的屋顶上升起了红旗。
    就在这些日子里，建立了工厂赤卫队。赤卫队接到的第一个任务就是把隐藏起来的沙皇宪警寻找出来，送交无产阶级法庭审判。这个任务我们很好地完成了。
    4月3日，列宁将从国外回来的消息很快地由彼得堡传到这里。这天正是假日，当时工厂党委决定组织二、三百工人到白岛车站去迎接我们党的领袖与导师列宁同志。
    在火车进站前几小时，彼得堡工人代表团也来到车站，其中也包括列宁的姐姐——玛丽娅·伊里尼斯娜·乌里扬诺娃。火车进站以后，我们看到列宁站在三等车、第五个车厢的门口。这时乐队奏起了“马赛曲”。工人高呼“乌拉”，“列宁同志万岁！”
    列宁同志从头上摘下鸭嘴帽向大家招呼。当他下车后，工人们立刻把他举了起来。在车站上列宁同志做了一个简短演说，他祝贺工人们推翻了沙皇政府，他说革命还没有结束，应当推翻地主和资本家政权，进行社会主义革命。
    1917年7月4日，歇斯特罗列茨克兵工厂的工人在布尔什维克党组织的领导下走到街上去游行，他们的口号是“全部政权归苏维埃！”。工人还派遣了代表团到彼得堡，要求首都的工农代表苏维埃赶走资产阶级政府，掌握全部政权。
    当时工厂党组织已经从彼得堡得到消息说临时政府决定派遣搜查队来没收赤卫队的武器。我们那时有将近两千只枪和几架机关枪，工人们在搜查队来到以前便把武器藏到拉兹里夫湖彼岸的森林里去了。
    7月10日晚，歇斯特罗列茨克城，特别是兵工厂被临时政府的搜查队紧紧地包围起来。第二天早晨七点钟，搜查队的领导人召集了全体工人，宣布在十二小时内必须交出所有的武器弹药。当天下午工人们把一些破旧的鸟枪、猎枪和军刀等交了出来。搜查队看没有达到目的，便在工人家里开始搜查。以布尔什维克沃斯阔夫同志为首的工厂委员会的委员们被捕。工人们宣布罢工以示抗议，被捕的同志终于被放了出来。
    二
    1917年10月，我们的赤卫队接到了光荣的任务：俄国社会民主党歇斯特罗列茨克委员会军事组命令赤卫队到彼得堡去帮助首都的无产阶级准备武装起义。
    10月24日晚间十二点，由七百人组成的赤卫队到达了斯莫尔尼宫。革命军事委员会命令它去占领苏瓦洛夫大街、发电站和自来水厂。
    后来我们又得到命令去占领因热涅尔碉堡，并把临时政府的士官生从那里赶出来。我们在维堡区赤卫队的配合下，在用劈柴做成的堡垒后面向马尔索沃广场进攻，最后终于闯进了因热涅尔碉堡，解除了士官生的武装。
    1917年10月的景象是永远不能忘记的。机关枪“哒哒”的声音和不断的枪响组成了革命的交响乐。到处都可以闻到革命的气息，一个伟大的革命成果在创造着、诞生着。
    三 
    1918年2月的某个夜晚。歇斯特罗列茨克的工厂的汽笛突然响了，人们惊惶起来，赤卫队队员拿起枪支，在路上装好弹药，跑到工厂去。在工厂的院子里召开群众大会，工厂委员会主席沃斯阔夫同志宣布：德国人正在进攻彼得堡，号召工人们拿起枪来去反对我们共同的敌人，保卫苏维埃政权。
    工人和赤卫队队员热烈地响应了这个号召，在第二天早上九点钟的时候就组织了一支由六百人组成的队伍。
    几天以后，我们的队伍得到命令到斯莫尔尼宫二楼去作保卫工作，我们的守卫部就离列宁的办公室不远。
    有一天，在深夜两点钟左右，我们没有值班的人被“取枪！”的号令声唤醒了，当我们准备好了以后便被带到革命总部斯莫尔尼宫大厅里去，那里已经挤满了人，连站脚的地方全没有了。大厅忽然静下来了。一会儿“乌拉”的呼声响遍了这个圆柱大厅，这时，列宁同志走进来了，在他身后是斯维尔德洛夫、捷尔任斯基和其他几位同志。当列宁快步走上讲台后，人们高兴得跳了起来，向自己敬爱的领袖欢呼鼓掌。
    掌声静下来以后，列宁发表演说：十月革命经受着严重的威胁，德国人已经占领了普斯可夫，并正向彼得堡进发。他号召我们去保卫社会主义祖国。
    在这一天晚上，所有的队伍都按战线分开。我们的赤卫队被派到芬兰去，那儿芬兰“白军”正准备向彼得堡进攻。离开斯莫尔尼宫以后，我们到芬兰车站坐上客车到达了劳突车站。这里枪声紧密，子弹打穿了车厢的木板。我们分散在车道下以后，看到了三天前来到此地守卫铁路的水兵。我们在天亮以后才看到夜战的痕迹，被打死的芬兰敌兵穿着白衣服躺在雪地上。
    在炮兵支持下，我们踏着达腰的深雪把敌人赶到了芬兰那边去。
    四
    在1918年春天我国最困难的日子里，列宁号召彼得格勒的工人到乡下去帮助贫农斗争富农分子，征收粮食。当时粮食问题是革命胜利的带根本性的问题。我们工厂的赤卫队响应党的号召开赴南方，到唐波夫州、尹扎温斯基和基尔桑诺夫向富农去征收粮食。征到的粮食装上火车，运到莫斯科和彼得格勒去帮助处在饥饿状态中的工人。在完成党的这件任务时我们遇到了富农分子的武装反抗，当时就不得不进行武装斗争。
    还在1917年6月，在顿河一带就建立了所谓“军事政府”，当时它代表地主和富裕的哥萨克的利益。这个“政府”敌视十月革命。顿河一带成了反革命分子的集中地。1917年11月白军将军阿列克赛耶夫也建立了“志愿部队”。
    在南方战线上，我们的第八军和相邻的第九军驻在顿河区域的北面。战斗开始以后，我们插向了顿河两侧，把克拉斯诺夫的白军哥萨克压向第十军面前，然后向敌军开始了激烈的战斗。
    当时作战的情形怎样呢？首先应当说明，在整个内战时期在俄罗斯南方根本没有一个固定的战线，当时除去个别的飞机外也没有空军。我们的交通工具在夏天是大车，冬天是雪橇。当我们在前线作战的时候，经常有彼得格勒和莫斯科的工人代表团前来慰问，这是战斗生活中最快乐的日子。
    五
    1919年2月我从南方战线被调回莫斯科，进红色步兵指挥训练班学习。这对我们这些工农子弟来说是很困难的。过去士官生学两年的功课，我们要在六个月内学会，因为各战线迫切地需要自己的红色的指挥员。
    这里的教员大部分是过去沙皇军队的军官，有的是团长，有的甚至是将军。这些人根本仇视苏维埃政权，并且敌视我们这些“厨娘的孩子”。但是为了取得口粮便不得不把这种感情隐藏起来。
    在学校里，我们向训练班委员建议请列宁同志来讲演。列宁同志虽然非常忙，但还是不止一次地来到训练班向我们讲话。一次，在练兵场上聚集了一千五百人，列宁发表了简短的演说，他谈到了国际形势和国内状况。列宁的讲演没有底稿，但是非常生动、非常尖锐。在讲话的时候他来回走动，并且经常采用手式。他在每一次讲话的末尾总是号召我们掌握军事知识以打击敌人。
    1919年10月4日，尤登尼奇的白匪军开始进攻彼得格勒。彼得格勒由十八岁至四十岁的成人全被动员起来。队伍一队队地开向前线。城里面战壕交错，在街巷里架起了大炮和机关枪。工厂建筑变成防卫要点，街道上筑起了堡垒。10月17日到22日是彼得格勒保卫中最严重的关头，市苏维埃号召工人为保卫这座伟大的城市贡献出一切。
    这时，革命军事委员会估计到西北战线上的紧急形势，决定派遣莫斯科红色指挥员训练班的学生去保卫彼得格勒。一千五百人坐车到达目的地后，领取了弹药、武器，马上奔赴前线，赶到波罗的海铁路线上的遂尔吉也夫空地车站去。
    尤登尼奇白军当时占领了亚历山大洛夫卡车站，企图割断彼得格勒与莫斯科的连系。我们到达目的地以后马上和敌人开始了交手战。敌人无论在人数方面或装备方面都远远超过我们，但是我们也有我们自己的优点：这就是革命的英雄主义和对革命事业必胜的信心。在战斗中特别令人难忘的是这样一件事情：时常在傍晚以后，汽车载着彼得格勒各工厂的武装工人来到前线，他们不管饥饿与疲劳和我们并肩卧在火线上同敌人进行夜战，第二天一清早就安顿好伤亡的同志，又马上回工厂去工作。
    我们踏着深没膝盖的泥泞，穿过冻人的冷雾，留下伤亡的同志继续前进。10月24、25日我们占领了红色乡村，尤登尼奇带领着逃兵跑到了卡特琴诺去了。
    我们来时是一千五百人，而战斗后回莫斯科时只剩了三百五十人了。
    1920年5月在莫斯科的剧院广场我最后一次看到了列宁同志，并听了他简短的讲演。
    1920年在训练班毕业后我到芬兰湾驻军部队当炮兵技术员。1921年3月参加了镇压喀琅施塔得反革命叛乱的战役。在战争史上从来还没有过用步兵和炮兵取下满布军舰、座落在孤岛上的海防要塞的事。
    红军部队分成南北两队在3月7日晚上开始第一次向喀琅施塔得进攻。进攻中的决定作用是在南线上，南线部队应当在炮兵堡垒“红色山头”的协助下直接拿下喀琅施塔得，这方面是由伏罗希洛夫同志指挥的。3月16日晚上红军战士得到了攻取喀琅施塔得的命令。夜里两点左右我们领到了白色外衣，从新彼得宫方面踏上芬兰湾的冰面。堡垒中有探照灯闪了过来，我们立刻卧倒在冰雪上。炮弹把冰炸开了，一部分进攻的同志落到水中，但这阻挡不住红军战士的前进。3月17日早晨六点钟左右，红军部队在伏罗希洛夫同志率领下，手里拿着“卡宾”枪冲进了喀琅施塔得堡垒。巷战开始了。
    3月18日早晨，喀琅施塔得完全被攻克了！从此苏维埃国家就步上了和平建设时期。社会主义祖国一天天巩固壮大起来了。
