    Preparing to Repel Aggressors at Any Time
    Syrian People Take Up Arms
    British Newspaper Reveals Frequent Turkish Military Activity on Turkish-Syrian Border
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 22nd: According to Syrian newspapers on the 21st, residents of Latakia, Aleppo, and Homs have mobilized and armed themselves, ready to repel any invasion of their homeland by Turkish troops instigated and supported by U.S. imperialism.
    Members of the People's Resistance Organization in Latakia have begun their defense duties on the border. Armed patrols are patrolling the coast, barbed wire has been laid in urban and rural areas, and government buildings are heavily guarded. Doctors in Latakia have volunteered to be assigned work by the People's Resistance Organization, and car owners have also voluntarily provided their vehicles for military use.
    Near the Turkish border, local officials, party leaders, trade union leaders, and residents of Aleppo have begun digging trenches around the city.
    The People's Resistance Organizations in Latakia, Aleppo, and Homs have been extremely busy recently registering volunteers and distributing weapons. According to government officials cited in the newspapers on the 21st, weapons will soon be distributed to members of the People's Resistance Organizations in other Syrian cities, so that every resident who can carry a weapon can participate in the battle to resist imperialist aggression.
    Syrian Chief of Staff, Major General Bizri, officially announced on October 21st that the trained troops composed of members of the People's Resistance Organization are the People's Anti-Enemy Army. Major General Bizri said to the People's Anti-Enemy Army: Before an act of aggression occurs, “you must now assist the security forces in maintaining order, guarding government buildings, and fighting those who create chaos.” Bizri also said that once the enemy invades our country, "you must act completely according to the will of Allah; and sacrifice everything to defend your motherland, to kill your enemies." Bizri also called on this army to "destroy roads, constantly strike the enemy, inflict maximum casualties on the enemy, and kill traitorous collaborators" in the war of resistance against aggression.
    Prime Minister Asali said at a National Front meeting on the 20th that if an aggression against Syria occurs, every city and village in Syria will be another Port Said for the aggressors. The Prime Minister also said that all Arab countries will resist imperialist aggression together with Syria. He said that the Soviet Union, for its own security, will impose military sanctions on the warmongers.
    The National Front meeting decided to fully support the government's policies and demanded that the government adhere to its current policies.
    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: TASS, London, 21st: British newspaper correspondents in Turkey reported on the concentration of Turkish troops in areas close to Syria. Geoffrey Tilsley, a "Daily Express" reporter who recently visited the Turkish-Syrian border area, wrote that a large number of Turkish troops wearing American uniforms were concentrated within twenty-five kilometers of the border inside Turkey, and large reinforcements were constantly being transferred there.
    Tilsley said: "On the border line, reconnaissance units have entered observation posts. The main force of the Turkish army is concentrated in the plains along the Aleppo (Syria)-Ankara (Turkey) railway, in the area between the Turkish villages of Islahiye and Fevzipaşa railway station."
    The reporter also reported that fifteen American "Patton" tanks belonging to the Turkish army were parked opposite a railway station on the border, and six reconnaissance planes were parked north of the railway he passed. He saw Turkish officers in cars and trucks constantly passing along the road forty kilometers north of the border.
    Tilsley wrote that he met an American Major, a member of the U.S. military advisory group. The officer said that he had served as a military advisor in that area for six months and that the Turkish army was organized according to the U.S. military system.

    准备随时迎击侵略者
    叙利亚人民拿起武器
    英报揭露土军在土叙边境活动频繁
    据新华社大马士革22日电　据叙利亚报纸21日报道，拉塔基亚、阿勒颇和霍姆斯的居民已经行动起来并且装备了武器，准备随时迎击土耳其军队在美帝国主义唆使和支持下对他们祖国的任何侵犯。
    拉塔基亚的人民抵抗组织的成员已经开始在边界上执行他们的防卫任务。武装巡逻队正在海岸上巡逻，城乡各地都布上了铁丝网，政府建筑物外警卫森严。拉塔基亚的医生们自动报名让人民抵抗组织分配他们工作，车主们也自动拿出他们的车子，供军事上使用。
    接近土耳其边境的阿勒颇的地方长官、各党领袖、工会领袖和居民已开始在城周围挖掘战壕。
    拉塔基亚、阿勒颇和霍姆斯的人民抵抗组织近来登记志愿人员和分配武器的工作极为忙碌。据21日报纸援引政府官员的话说，不久即将分配武器给叙利亚其他城市的人民抵抗组织的成员，使每一个可以携带武器的居民都能参加抵抗帝国主义侵略的战斗。
    叙利亚参谋长比兹里少将10月21日正式宣布已经训练好的由人民抵抗组织成员组成的军队为人民抗敌军。比兹里少将对人民抗敌军发表谈话说：在侵略行动发生以前，现在“你们必须协助保安部队维持秩序、守卫政府建筑物以及和那些制造混乱的人作斗争”。比兹里还说，敌人一旦侵略我们的国家，“你们就必须完全按照真主的意志做事；并且牺牲你们的一切来保卫你们的祖国，来杀死你们的敌人。”比兹里还号召这支军队在抵抗侵略的战争中要“破坏公路、不断地打击敌人，使敌人遭到最大的伤亡，并且杀死通敌的叛徒”。
    阿萨利总理20日在民族阵线会议上说，如果发生了对叙利亚的侵略，叙利亚的每一个城市和乡村将是对侵略者的另一个塞得港。总理又说，所有阿拉伯国家都将和叙利亚一起抵抗帝国主义的侵略。他说，苏联为了它自己的安全，将对战争贩子实施军事制裁。
    民族阵线会议决定充分支持政府的政策，并要求政府坚持它现在执行的政策。
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社伦敦21日讯：英国报纸驻土耳其的记者报道了土耳其军队在靠近叙利亚的地区集结的情况。不久前曾去土叙交界地区采访的“每日快报”记者乔弗里·特尔斯比写道，在离开边境二十五公里的土耳其境内集结了大量的穿着美国军服的土耳其军队，而且大批增援部队还源源不断地调去。
    特尔斯比说：“在国境线上，侦察部队已经进入观察阵地。土耳其军队的主力集中在阿勒颇（叙利亚）—安卡拉（土耳其）铁路沿线的平原地带，在土耳其的伊斯利亚谢村和费弗齐帕夏火车站之间的地区”。
    这个记者还报道，在边境的一个火车站对面停有十五辆美国“巴顿式”的土耳其坦克，在他经过的铁路北面停着六架侦察机。他在国境线以北四十公里处沿途都看到土耳其军官坐着汽车和载重汽车接连不断地驰过。
    特尔斯比写道，他碰到一个美国少校军官、美国军事顾问团团员。这个军官说，他曾在那个地区担任过六个月的军事顾问，并且说，土耳其军队是采取美军编制的。
