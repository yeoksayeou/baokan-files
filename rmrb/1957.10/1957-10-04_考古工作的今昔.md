Rightist elements are attacking the Party and socialism from all sides, starting fires everywhere, leaving no stone unturned. Their evil claws have also reached into the cultural relics field. Rightist elements say, "Laymen cannot lead experts," and want the Party to abandon its leadership over the cultural relics field. Their method is to deny achievements and exaggerate shortcomings. They describe the cultural relics work since liberation as a complete mess, and say that the cultural relics cause in New China is not as good as it used to be. They want to change the development path of the cultural relics cause from the socialist road to the capitalist road.

As an archaeological worker, I am willing to use the comparison of the two roads of archaeological work in our country before and after liberation to expose the lies of the rightist elements. The great achievements of archaeological work in New China are ironclad proof of the superiority of the socialist road.

Let's start with the excavation of Paleolithic sites, which used to be done in a semi-colonial way. The excavation of Zhoukoudian was funded by the American monopoly capitalist Rockefeller Foundation, which stipulated that it could only work in Zhoukoudian. Therefore, after more than ten years of digging, it only circled around Dragon Bone Hill in Zhoukoudian. Since liberation, the scope of investigation has been expanded, and combined with reports from the people and engineering departments. As a result, the Dingcun site in Xiangfen, the Licun site in Quwo, and the Fanjiazhuang site in Jiaocheng were discovered in Shanxi Province. The cave survey in Guangxi, in addition to the discovery of Paleolithic and Neolithic artifacts, also discovered Gigantopithecus fossils. The People's Daily on September 20th recently published news that human fossils and Paleolithic artifacts were found again in the Salawusu River in the Hetao area.

To give another example, the Yin Dynasty sites before liberation were almost limited to the Yin Ruins in Xiaotun, Anyang. Fifteen seasons of excavation were carried out in Anyang, with the goal of only digging for oracle bones and bronzes. Every time I went to Anyang from Nanjing, I passed through Zhengzhou, but I did not discover this important Yin Dynasty site in Zhengzhou. After liberation, not only were many important discoveries made in the excavation of Zhengzhou, but also many Yin Dynasty sites were discovered in Xingtai, Hebei, Luoyang, Henan, and the Sanmenxia Reservoir area of the Yellow River.

As for the Neolithic remains, the discovery of a site in the past seemed like a big deal. After liberation, the investigation work was launched. For example, the Yellow River Reservoir Investigation Team and the Shanxi General Survey Team discovered dozens of sites at a time. Since liberation, hundreds of Neolithic sites have been discovered. At the same time, we have done more in-depth work. For example, at the Banpo site in Xi'an, our work is not only to dig up stone tools and pottery shards, but also to understand all aspects of the lives of the people at that time, from housing to food. Now a museum has been built on the original site to preserve it for everyone to visit and study. The Sanmenxia Reservoir Archaeological Team is also conducting more in-depth research on several Neolithic sites. The Nanjing Museum has recently selected several sites in southern Jiangsu (such as Dagang in Dantu, Beiyinyangying and Suojincun and Anhuaicun in Nanjing) for excavation in order to further understand the features of the Neolithic culture in East China.

Tombs of the Zhou Dynasty that produced bronzes used to fall into the hands of antique dealers as soon as they were unearthed, and most of them were scattered to museums and private collectors in imperialist countries through antique dealers. After liberation, the important Western Zhou bronze groups include Doumenzhen in Xi'an, Yandunshan in Dantu, Lingyuan in former Rehe, and the recent Licun in Mei County, Shaanxi and Dongbao in Yongning, Hongzhao, Shanxi. More tombs of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty have been excavated, and the harvest is richer. Important ones include Huixian, Changsha, Luoyang, Changzhi, Shou County, and Xi'an. Recently, Warring States tombs have also been discovered in Tianjin and Ningbo. This year, the tombs of the noble family of the Guo State in Shaan County, Henan, and the Warring States wooden coffin tombs in Changtaiguan, Xinyang, have yielded very important cultural relics. The former is mainly bronzes, with hundreds of large pieces, some with inscriptions. The latter has a large number of exquisite woodware, lacquerware, bronzes, and bamboo slips. If these antiquities had been discovered before liberation, they would have been sold separately and most of them would have fallen overseas. Now, they are entirely preserved in the hands of the people, providing them for everyone to appreciate and study.

Archaeological work is not about digging for treasure, but about doing excavation and research from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism in order to understand the living conditions and socio-economic system of our ancestors. Therefore, regarding the excavations of the Zhou Dynasty, we also selected the residential sites of the time to work on. Zhangjiapo near Fenghao Village in Xi'an not only unearthed chariot and horse pits of the Western Zhou Dynasty, but also cleared out the house sites and pottery kilns of the time. Warring States sites have also been excavated in the western suburbs of Luoyang and Shijiazhuang, Hebei. A site of the Zhou Dynasty in Jianxi, Luoyang is also being cleared and excavated.

Han tombs are discovered almost everywhere. Hundreds of Han tombs have been excavated in Luoyang, Changsha, Anshan, and other places. There is a preliminary understanding of the evolutionary process of Han tombs. Recently, attention has also been paid to the excavation of Han residential sites. The Western Han village site in Sandaohao, Liaoyang, and the city site of Han Henan in Luoyang reflect the lives of the people in urban and rural areas at that time. This year, the excavation of Chang'an City of the Han Dynasty has also begun. Although only three city gates have been dug up, they have allowed us to understand the structure of the city gates at that time, and we have also seen the red burnt soil left over from the fire during the Wang Mang rebellion two thousand years ago. The Han buildings excavated in the suburbs of Xi'an may be Biyong and Ligong, which are also important materials for studying Han architecture. Shizhaishan in Jinning, Yunnan, unearthed a large number of bronzes and goldware, including a gold-cast "King of Dian Seal." Although it is not clear whether it is a tomb or a cellar, it is indeed a major discovery of the culture of ethnic minorities in the border areas during the Han Dynasty.

Going further down, the Sui and Tang tombs in Xi'an unearthed a large number of antiquities, including epitaphs, tricolor pottery figurines, porcelain, bronze mirrors, and gold ornaments. Recently, the excavation of the Daming Palace site has also begun. Luoyang also investigated the Tang City and excavated some Tang tombs.

I think there is no need to list any more, there are so many new discoveries that it is impossible to finish them in a short article. Last year, the general survey of cultural relics also began. This is unparalleled by the previous solo investigation work. We can expect that future discoveries will be even richer. We used to dream of one day being able to launch our country's archaeological work. Now these dreams have come true, how can we not be excited!

If we compare the situation before and after liberation, we can know that this is the difference between two lines. The reason why we can achieve such achievements today is because we have embarked on the socialist road. Archaeological work in the past was a state of free and loose anarchy. Individuals could do whatever they wanted as long as they had money, and no one could interfere. Imperialists plundered cultural relics everywhere in our country, stealing openly and secretly. Unfilial antique dealers in our country also made a fortune by buying and selling antiques. Now, under the leadership of the Party, archaeological work has embarked on the socialist road. Our work must cooperate with basic construction, distinguish priorities, and arrange work in a focused and step-by-step manner. Of course, we have only just embarked on this road and are moving in this direction, and have not yet fully passed through this road to reach our destination. In other words, our current leadership of archaeological work is not strong enough, and our organization is not tight enough. In the future, we should strengthen the leadership and organization of the Party and the government. However, the opinions of the rightist elements are exactly the opposite. They oppose the leadership of the Party and the government in various ways. Some shouted "Laymen cannot lead experts," proclaimed themselves experts and wanted to be independent, take command, and told Party leading comrades to step down. Some held on to the feudal ideology of local separatism and wanted to dominate one side. Some even formed small cliques and wanted to seize leadership.

The arguments of the rightist elements are hateful. They also have a market in the cultural relics field, which is worthy of vigilance. As pointed out in the People's Daily editorial on September 18, the leftists are still a relatively small minority in the current intellectual circles, and the majority are middle-of-the-roaders who can be either left or right. In this regard, the weaknesses of the cultural relics field are even more prominent. Many people in the cultural relics field came from the old society. Like general intellectuals, they still retain many old ideas that are not easy to wash away. And the cultural relics field deals with many old things, so it is easier to feel nostalgic for old things and not accustomed to the new life and new working methods under the socialist system. Therefore, it is easier to be used by rightist elements. Fortunately, this time the conspiracy of the rightist elements was exposed in various units, arousing everyone's anger. As a result, a vigorous anti-rightist struggle has been launched in various units. We demand that the rightist elements in the cultural relics field bow their heads and confess their crimes, thoroughly confess, repent, and start anew. At the same time, we must educate ourselves, exercise ourselves, and raise our awareness in this struggle so that we can pass the socialist barrier. We must, under the leadership of the Party, resolutely take the socialist road.

    考古工作的今昔
    中国科学院考古研究所副所长  夏鼐
    右派分子从各方面向党向社会主义进攻，到处点火，无孔不入，他们的魔爪也深入到文物界里来。右派分子说：“外行不能领导内行”，要党放弃对文物界的领导。他们的办法是否定成绩，夸大缺点。他们把解放以来的文物工作说成一团糟，把新中国的文物事业说成今不如昔。他们要把文物事业的发展道路从社会主义的道路改到走资产阶级的道路。
    作为一个考古工作者，我愿意利用解放前后我国考古工作情况的两条道路的对比，来揭穿右派分子的谎言。新中国考古工作的伟大成绩，便是社会主义道路的优越性的铁证。
    我们从旧石器时代遗址的发掘说起，从前是半殖民地的做法。周口店的发掘，是由美国垄断资本家罗氏基金会出钱的，指定只能在周口店工作，所以掘了十几年，只是围绕着周口店龙骨山打圈子。解放以来，才扩大了调查的范围，并且结合人民群众和工程部门的报告。于是，在山西省境内便发现了襄汾的丁村遗址，曲沃的里村遗址和交城的范家庄等遗址。广西的洞穴调查，除了发现新旧石器之外，还发现了巨猿化石。最近9月20日的人民日报还发表河套萨拉乌苏河再度发现人类化石和旧石器的消息。
    再举一个例子，解放以前的殷代遗址，差不多限于安阳小屯的殷墟。在安阳发掘了十五季，目标只是想挖甲骨和铜器。每次由南京去安阳都经过郑州，却没有发现郑州这个重要的殷代遗址。解放以后，不仅在郑州的发掘中有许多重要的发现，并且还发现了河北邢台、河南洛阳和黄河三门峡水库区的许多殷代遗址。
    至于新石器时代的遗存，从前发现了一个遗址，便好像是了不起的事情。解放后，展开了调查工作，像黄河水库调查队和山西普查队，一发现便是好几十处。解放以来所发现的新石器遗址已是好几百处之多。同时我们又做比较深入的工作，例如西安半坡遗址，我们的工作不仅是挖石器和陶片，而是了解当时人民生活的各方面，从住宅到粮食，都要弄清楚。现在已在原地盖了博物馆，保存下来供给大家参观和研究。三门峡水库考古队也正在几个新石器遗址做比较深入的研究。南京博物院最近也在江苏南部选择几处（如丹徒大港、南京市北阴阳营、锁金村和安怀村），从事发掘，以求进一步了解华东地区的新石器文化的面貌。
    两周时代出铜器的墓葬，从前一出土便入古董商人手中，大部分还经过古董商流散到帝国主义国家的博物馆和私人收藏家手中去。解放以后，西周的铜器群，重要的有西安斗门镇、丹徒烟墩山、旧热河凌源和最近的陕西郿县李村和山西洪赵永凝东堡。东周时代的墓葬，发掘得更多，收获更丰富。重要的有辉县、长沙、洛阳、长治、寿县、西安等地。最近连天津和宁波也都有战国墓葬发现。今年河南陕县虢国贵族墓地和信阳长台关战国木椁墓都有非常重要的出土文物。前者以铜器为主，大件的有几百件，有些还有铭文。后者有大批精美的木器、漆器、铜器和竹简。这些古物如果是解放以前被发现，一定分散出卖，大部分流落国外。现在是整个保存在人民的手中，提供大家欣赏和研究。
    考古工作不是挖宝，而是用马列主义的观点来做发掘和研究，以求了解我们祖先的生活情况和社会经济制度。所以关于两周时代的发掘，我们也选择当时的居住遗址来做。西安丰镐村附近的张家坡不仅掘到西周时代的车马坑，还清理出当时的屋址和陶窑。在洛阳西郊和河北石家庄，也都发掘到战国遗址。在洛阳的涧西还有一片两周时代的遗址正在清理发掘中。
    汉墓是几乎到处都有发现，在洛阳、长沙、鞍山市等处，一发掘便是几百座的汉墓。对于汉代墓葬的演化过程已有初步的认识。最近又注意到汉代居住遗址的发掘。辽阳三道濠的西汉村落遗址和洛阳汉河南城的城址，反映当时城乡的人民生活。今年又开始发掘汉代长安城。虽仅只掘了三座城门，但已可使我们了解当时城门的结构，并且还看到二千年前王莽时兵乱火焚所遗留下来的红烧土。西安郊区发掘出来的汉代建筑物，可能是辟雍和离宫，也是研究汉代建筑的重要资料。云南晋宁的石寨山，出土大批铜器和金器，包括一颗黄金铸的“滇国王印”。虽然是墓葬或是窖藏还没有弄清楚，但确是汉代边区少数民族文化的重大发现。
    再往下讲，西安的隋唐墓葬，出土了大批古物，包括墓志石、三彩陶俑、瓷器、铜镜、金饰等。最近又开始发掘大明宫的遗址。洛阳也调查了唐城和发掘了一些唐墓。
    我想再不必往下列举，新的发现多得是无法在一篇短文内说完的。去年又开始了文物普查工作，这是从前走单帮式的调查工作所无法比拟的。我们可以预料到今后的发现将会更丰富。我们从前曾梦想有这么一天能展开我国的考古工作。现在这些梦想都实现了，怎不令人兴奋！
    如果我们将解放前后的情况作一对比，便可知道这是两条路线的不同。今日所以能取得这样的成绩是由于走上了社会主义的道路。从前的考古工作是自由散漫的无政府状态。个人只要有钱便可自由去干，谁也不能干涉。帝国主义者在我国到处掠夺文物，明抢暗偷。我国的不肖的古董商人，也以买卖古物来发横财。现今在党的领导下考古工作走了社会主义的道路。我们的工作要配合基本建设，分别缓急，有重点和有步骤地布置工作。当然，我们还只踏上这条道路朝这个方向走，还没有完全通过这条道路达到目的地。换句话说，我们现下的考古工作的领导还不够强，组织还不够密。今后应该加强党和政府的领导和组织工作。但是右派分子的意见恰巧相反，他们用各种方法反对党和政府的领导。有的嚷“外行不能领导内行”，自封为专家要闹独立，挂帅印，叫党员领导同志下台。有的抱着地方割据的封建思想，想独霸一方。有的还结成小集团，想夺取领导权。
    右派分子的论调是可恨的，他们在文物界中也有市场，这是值得警惕的。像9月18日人民日报社论所指出的，目前的知识界中，左派还是比较的少数，多数还是可左可右的中间派。在这方面，文物界的弱点更为显著。文物界的许多人是由旧社会中过来的，像一般知识分子一样，还残留许多旧思想，不易洗清。并且文物界所接触的有许多是古旧的东西，所以更容易对于旧事物发生留恋，不习惯于社会主义制度下的新生活和新工作方式。因之，更容易为右派分子所利用。幸得这次右派分子的阴谋在各单位都被揭露，引起大家的愤怒，因之，在各单位都展开了轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争。我们要求文物界的右派分子低头认罪，彻底交代，痛改前非，重新做人。同时，我们要在这斗争中自我教育，锻炼自己，提高觉悟，以便能通过社会主义的关。我们要在党的领导下，坚决走社会主义的道路。
