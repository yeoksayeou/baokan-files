Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 4th October: The Fourth World Trade Union Congress opened here this morning. A total of 635 trade union representatives and observers from 59 countries are attending the congress.

　　World Federation of Trade Unions President Vittorio took the floor to deliver the opening speech amidst thunderous applause. He pointed out that the unprecedented scale of participation in this congress powerfully demonstrates the common desire of the working class around the world for unity and unification.

　　The congress unanimously adopted the six items on the agenda: 1. Report on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the international trade union movement for improving workers' living standards, economic, social and democratic rights, disarmament, and the friendly relations and unified development of national independence. Reporter: World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Louis Saillant. 2. The Tasks of Trade Unions in the Anti-Colonialist Struggle. Reporter: General Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress and Vice-President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Dange. 3. Report of the International Workers Solidarity Fund Committee on its activities, accumulated experience, and the assistance it can provide for the future development of international solidarity. Reporter: Secretary General of the Sudanese Trade Union Federation, Shafi. 4. Financial Review Report. Reporter: Reiner, representative of the Dutch Unified Trade Union. 5. Suggestions on amending the Charter of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Reporter: Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Grassi. 6. Election of the leading bodies of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Financial Review Committee.

　　Then, Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, Warnke, and Acting Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Heinrich Rau, delivered welcome speeches and congratulatory messages to the congress.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 4th October: According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, Prague: The "Labor Daily" of October 3 published an interview given by World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Louis Saillant to reporters on the significance of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, which opened in Leipzig on October 4. Saillant pointed out that the congress would be attended by more than 1,000 representatives representing over 100 million organized workers. The agenda of the congress mainly includes issues such as economic, social demands and working conditions. The congress will also discuss the demands for an immediate ban on nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons testing, and the anti-colonialist struggle.

　　Louis Saillant emphasized that the Fourth Congress must study how to promote the development of international trade union relations. He said that international relations between trade union organizations have greatly developed in the past few years. However, we cannot ignore the fact that there are difficulties and obstacles. The main obstacle is the discriminatory policy pursued by those trade union organizations that have not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions but have joined the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. This policy hinders efforts to expand international trade union relations. In order to develop these relations, this relationship must be handled democratically at all trade union meetings and at all gatherings of working people. Louis Saillant pointed out that the World Federation of Trade Unions proposed to establish cooperative relations with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, but the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions has so far refused. He said that he believes that this relationship must be established, and it is too early to talk about the outcome. However, since efforts to support international trade union solidarity are fully in line with the needs and aspirations of the working people of the world, this is inevitable. The important resolutions passed by trade union organizations in many countries that do not participate in the World Federation of Trade Unions clearly show these efforts. Louis Saillant concluded: "The Fourth World Trade Union Congress will definitely take a step forward in restoring international trade union solidarity. Every representative of the 100 million workers participating in the Leipzig grand meeting will surely fulfill this huge responsibility."

　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd October: TASS, Berlin, 2nd October: The German News Agency broadcast a communique on the 15th meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions held in Leipzig on October 1st and 2nd. The communique stated that the meeting heard a report by World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary Giuseppe Casadei on the preparations for the Fourth World Trade Union Congress to be held in Leipzig on October 4 and approved the working procedures of the congress.

　　The communique indicated that the delegates and observers attending the Fourth World Trade Union Congress will represent approximately 100 million workers. Ninety trade union organizations that have not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions will participate in the congress.

    一亿多工人的代表济济一堂
    世界工会代表大会在来比锡开幕
    赛扬指出大会必将有助于恢复国际工会团结
    新华社来比锡4日电　世界工会第四次代表大会今天上午在这里开幕。出席这次大会的有来自五十九个国家的工会代表和观察员等共六百三十五人。
    世界工会联合会主席维多里奥在雷动的掌声中致开幕词。他指出，这次大会参加者的空前广泛，有力地表明了，全世界工人阶级要求团结、统一的共同愿望。
    大会一致通过了大会的六项议程：一、世界工会活动和国际工会运动为争取提高工人生活水平、经济、社会和民主权利、裁减军备及民族独立的友好联系和统一的发展的报告。报告人世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬。二、工会在反殖民主义斗争中的任务。报告人全印工会大会总书记、世界工联副主席丹吉。三、国际工人团结基金委员会关于它的活动、积累的经验以及它对国际团结今后发展所能提供的帮助的报告。报告人：苏丹工会联合会总书记莎非。四、经费审查报告。报告人：荷兰统一工会代表莱纳。五、关于修改世界工会联合会章程的建议。报告人：世界工会联合会书记葛拉西。六、选举世界工会联合会的领导机构及经费审查委员会。
    接着自由德国工会联合会主席瓦恩克和德意志民主共和国代理总理海因里希·劳向大会致欢迎词和贺词。
    新华社4日讯　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社布拉格讯：10月3日的“劳动报”发表了世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬就10月4日在来比锡召开的世界工会第四次代表大会的重要意义对记者发表的谈话。赛扬指出，这次大会将有代表着一亿多有组织的工人的一千多名代表参加。代表大会的议程主要包括经济、社会要求和劳动条件等问题。大会还将讨论立刻禁止核武器和核武器试验的要求和反殖民主义的斗争。
    路易·赛扬着重指出，第四次代表大会必须研究如何促进国际工会关系的发展。他说，工会组织之间的国际关系在过去几年中有了很大的发展。不过，我们不能够忽视存在着困难和障碍这一事实。主要的障碍是那些没有参加世界工联而参加国际自由工会联合会的工会组织所奉行的歧视政策。这种政策妨碍了扩大国际工会关系的努力。为了发展这些关系，必须在一切工会会议上和劳动人民集会的一切场合以民主方式处理这种关系。路易·赛扬指出，世界工会联合会建议同国际自由工会联合会建立合作关系，但是国际自由工会联合会迄今一直加以拒绝。他说，他认为，这种关系必须建立，现在就来谈结果如何为时尚属过早。但是，由于支持国际工会团结的努力是完全符合全世界劳动人民的需要和愿望的，因此这是不可避免的。许多国家中不参加世界工会联合会的工会组织通过的重要决议中清楚地表明了这些努力。路易·赛扬最后说：“世界工会第四次代表大会必将向恢复国际工会团结方面前进一步。参加来比锡盛大集会的一亿工人的每个代表肯定会履行这个巨大的责任。”
    新华社3日讯　塔斯社柏林2日讯：德意志通讯社广播了一项关于10月1日、2日在来比锡举行的世界工会联合会执行委员会第十五次会议的公报。公报说，会议听取了世界工联书记朱塞佩·卡萨德关于10月4日在来比锡召开第四届世界工会代表大会的筹备工作的报告并且批准了大会工作程序。
    公报表明，参加第四届世界工会代表大会的代表和观察员将代表约一亿工人。参加代表大会的将有九十个没有参加世界工联的工会组织。
