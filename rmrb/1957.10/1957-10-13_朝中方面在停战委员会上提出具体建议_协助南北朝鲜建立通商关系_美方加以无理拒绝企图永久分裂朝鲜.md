Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th -- According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong: At the suggestion of the North Korean-Chinese side, the Military Armistice Commission held a meeting today. At the meeting, Major General Zheng Guolu, chief member of the North Korean-Chinese side, suggested that both sides of the Military Armistice Commission grant special permission to people who wish to travel to certain locations within the military control areas of both sides for the purpose of trade and material exchange between North and South Korea, so that they can travel through channels in the demilitarized zone agreed upon by both sides.

At the meeting, Major General Zheng Guolu pointed out that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has consistently made efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea. On October 7th, the Minister of Internal and External Commerce of the Republic also proposed specific ways to establish trade relations between North and South Korea to the South Korean authorities. Zheng Guolu said that before the war, North and South Korea had designated certain locations near the 38th parallel to trade necessary materials. Therefore, it would not be difficult to agree on certain locations for trade now.

Zheng Guolu said that the issue here is the demilitarized zone and the military demarcation line for implementing trade relations. Therefore, the Military Armistice Commission needs to take necessary assisting measures in accordance with the Armistice Agreement. In this regard, Zheng Guolu put forward the following specific suggestions:

"Considering that the Korean issue has not yet been resolved peacefully, the vital interests of the Korean people, and the necessity of trade and material exchange between North and South Korea, the following temporary measures should be taken:

1. People residing in the military control area of the North Korean-Chinese side or the military control area of the United Nations Command, who want to travel to certain locations designated by the North and South Korean authorities within the other side's military control area for the purpose of trade and material exchange, may pass through the northern and southern edges of the demilitarized zone and the military demarcation line.

2. In order to facilitate the travel of the people stipulated in the first item to the other side's military control area, certain locations should be designated on the military demarcation line as the places for them to pass through. The two sides of the armistice are responsible for building and maintaining channels reaching the passage points within their respective demilitarized zones."

Zheng Guolu finally pointed out that the issue of allowing passage through the northern and southern edges of the demilitarized zone and the military demarcation line is related to both sides of the armistice. Taking the above measures by the Military Armistice Commission is not only necessary for realizing trade between North and South Korea, but will also have a beneficial impact on the North and South Korean authorities in resolving mature issues.

However, the US side at the meeting even reversed black and white, attempting to shift the responsibility for the failure of peaceful reunification of Korea to the North Korean-Chinese side, and seeking excuses to say that the Military Armistice Commission is not suitable to discuss this issue, and rejected the legitimate suggestions of the North Korean-Chinese side.

In response, Major General Zheng Guolu pointed out that it is precisely because of the consistent obstruction and opposition of the US side that the peaceful reunification of Korea has not been realized. The prompt withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and leaving the Korean issue to the Korean people themselves is the primary measure for the peaceful reunification of Korea. But the US side is attempting to permanently occupy South Korea. He said that today the US side rejected the legitimate suggestions of the North Korean-Chinese side without careful consideration, which exposed the ugly face of American imperialism's unwillingness to peacefully reunify Korea.

Zheng Guolu pointed out that in accordance with Articles 7, 9, and 8 of the Armistice Agreement, the Military Armistice Commission can and should take measures to allow people to pass through the demilitarized zone for trade between North and South Korea. Zheng Guolu said that the US side's attitude that this issue should not be discussed in the Military Armistice Commission is an attempt to evade, with the aim of obstructing the resolution of the issue and perpetuating the division of Korea.

Zheng Guolu expressed the hope that the US side would consider the suggestions of the North Korean-Chinese side.

　　朝中方面在停战委员会上提出具体建议
    协助南北朝鲜建立通商关系
    美方加以无理拒绝企图永久分裂朝鲜
    新华社平壤11日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会在朝中方面的建议下今天举行会议。朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将在会上建议，军事停战委员会双方给予以南北朝鲜间的通商和物资交易为目的愿来往于双方军事控制地区内的一定地点的人们以特殊许可，使他们在经过双方协议的非军事区内的通道来往。
    郑国禄少将在会上指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为了实现朝鲜的和平统一，一贯进行努力。共和国对内外商业相10月7日又向南朝鲜当局提出了南北朝鲜间建立通商关系的具体途径。郑国禄说，南北朝鲜在战前曾经指定三八线附近的一定的地点交易过必要的物资。因此，现在商定一定的地点进行通商交易是不会有什么困难的。
    郑国禄说，在这里成为问题的是实行通商交易关系的非军事区和军事分界线的问题，因此需要军事停战委员会根据停战协定采取必要的协助性的措施。就此，郑国禄提出下面的具体建议：
    “考虑到朝鲜问题还未得到和平解决和朝鲜人民的切身利益以及南北朝鲜间的通商和物资交易的必要性，采取下面的暂行措施：
    一、居住在朝中方面军事控制地区或联合国军方面军事控制地区的人们以通商和物资交易为目的，要来往于对方军事控制地区内经南北朝鲜当局指定的一定地点时，可通过非军事区南北缘和军事分界线。
    二、为给予第一项所规定的人们来往于对方军事控制地区的便利，在军事分界线上指定一定的地点为他们通过的地点，停战双方负责在各自的非军事区内修筑和维持到达通过地点的通道。”
    郑国禄最后指出，准许通过非军事区南北缘和军事分界线问题是同停战双方有关的。军事停战委员会采取上述措施，不仅是实现南北朝鲜间的通商所必需的，而且将对南北朝鲜当局解决成熟的问题给予有益的影响。
    但是，美方在会上竟颠倒黑白，企图把朝鲜和平统一没有实现的责任转嫁给朝中方面，并寻找借口说军事停战委员会不适于讨论这个问题，拒绝朝中方面的正当建议。
    对此，郑国禄少将指出，正是因为美方一贯地阻挠和反对，朝鲜的和平统一才没有实现。美军迅速撤出南朝鲜把朝鲜问题交给朝鲜人民自己，这就是和平统一朝鲜的首要措施。但是美方却企图永远占领南朝鲜。他说，今天美方未经慎重考虑就拒绝朝中方面的正当建议，这就暴露了美帝国主义不愿和平统一朝鲜的面目。
    郑国禄指出，根据停战协定第七款、第九款和第八款的规定，军事停战委员会为了南北朝鲜间的通商是能够并且应该采取措施使来往的人们通过非军事区。郑国禄说，美方说这个问题不应在军事停战委员会讨论，这种态度是企图规避，目的是阻挠问题的解决，把朝鲜的分裂永久化。
    郑国禄表示希望美方考虑朝中方面的建议。
