    To Undertake Socialist Construction, One Must Love Socialism
    Leading Cooperatives Cannot Be Separated from Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
    The Army-People Friendship Cooperative in the Suburbs of Beijing Refutes the Erroneous Arguments of Prosperous Middle Peasants

    (Reported by this newspaper) A crucial question in the extensive debate at the Army-People Friendship Cooperative in Kandan Township, Fengtai District, Beijing, was whether poor and lower-middle peasants could lead the cooperative. This question was raised by Chen Huiguang, a prosperous middle peasant from the Third Production Team. During a middle peasant symposium in September, where people were encouraged to speak freely, Chen Huiguang, along with his relatives, the prosperous middle peasants Chen Dengke and Chen Wuguang, and the lower-middle peasant Chen Wenguang, attacked the Party's class policy in rural areas. They argued that poor and lower-middle peasants could not lead the cooperative because "poor and lower-middle peasants used to cultivate only two or three mu of land and lack the ability and experience. Now, they are supposed to manage thousands of mu in the cooperative, which is simply ridiculous." At the same time, they tried their best to boast about the capabilities of prosperous middle peasants, implying that they should be the ones to lead the agricultural cooperative. After six debate meetings, the members presented many facts that shattered the fallacies of Chen Huiguang and others.

    When the debate reached the point of "Can poor and lower-middle peasants lead the cooperative?", the participants were more enthusiastic than usual, and the atmosphere was even more tense. The members scrambled to sign up to speak. Wang Dequan, who had worked as a farmhand, used a rhetorical question to refute the argument. He said, "Chen Huiguang, you said that poor and lower-middle peasants have little land and lack experience, so they cannot lead the cooperative. You mean that prosperous middle peasants have experience and should lead the cooperative. But I want to say that you do have experience, but it is only experience in taking the capitalist road. In my opinion, if we let you lead, you would lead everyone back to the old capitalist road, and everyone would inevitably become a farmhand again and be oppressed. Do we want this kind of leadership? What poor and lower-middle peasants lack is land, but they have plenty of ability. They were oppressed in the past, but now they have turned over, firmly support socialism, and therefore have a firm foothold and are not afraid of difficulties. If they cannot lead the cooperative, then who can?" Yang Yongxiang said:
  "To say that poor people had no ability in the past is because they had no land, no farm tools, and no livestock, so they had to work as farmhands for landlords. Today, the poor and lower-middle peasants have become masters of their own affairs. Only those who have turned over can lead the cooperative, and there can be no ambiguity about this!"

    Before Yang Yongxiang finished speaking, Zhang Guoyou quickly added, "Whether poor and lower-middle peasants can lead the cooperative has to be judged by the facts. Not to mention anything far away, everyone knows how big of a flood we suffered last year, and how much difficulty our cooperative encountered. However, we finally overcame the disaster and consolidated the cooperative. Isn't this the leadership of the cooperative cadres who came from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds? Tell me, does this count as being capable or not? Not to mention landlords and rich peasants, do you prosperous middle peasants have this kind of ability?"

    The memory of last year's big flood is still fresh in people's minds. The members described the situation last year: During the tense autumn harvest season, it rained heavily for many days in a row, and everywhere was flooded, with the water submerging half of the houses. In the face of this severe disaster, the cooperative cadres who came from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds showed a tenacious fighting spirit. They fought the flood for seven days and seven nights without sleeping. Tian Baorong, the cooperative director from a poor peasant background, led more than a hundred people to dig drainage ditches in the dark. When the weir ditch was washed away by the water, he immediately lay down and used his body to block the gap. Although Wu Fumin was disabled with only one leg, he actively directed the members to drain water and rescue crops, persisting until the flood receded. However, during this disastrous period, prosperous middle peasants like Chen Huiguang hid in their houses for two or three months. Not only did they not come out to fight the flood, but they also influenced more than thirty prosperous middle peasant households to demand withdrawal from the cooperative. When the spring came this year and food was scarce, the cooperative cadres led everyone to engage in sideline occupations, organized more than sixty carts for transportation, and led some members to rush to plant vegetables. Everyone actively tried to overcome difficulties. The poor peasants Tian Baoshun and Sun Qingyuan ate cornbread and pickles every day and never asked the cooperative for subsidies, expressing that they would rather die than withdraw from the cooperative. What were the prosperous middle peasants doing at this time? Zhang Renxin is one example. He complained about difficulties every day and asked the cooperative for money. After getting thirty yuan, he bought a large wooden box for storing clothes. During the wheat harvest this year, Zhu Zhenggui, a prosperous middle peasant in the cooperative, incited Du Dechun, the production team leader from a poor peasant background, to ask the cooperative to keep more wheat. Du Dechun replied to him: I resolutely obey the decision of the cooperative management committee. We cannot only care about personal interests.

    In the face of these vivid facts, Chen Huiguang admitted defeat. He confessed to everyone: My mind is full of capitalist ideas, and I see things differently from everyone else. This time, everyone's help is like a key opening a lock. I see clearly that capitalism is a dark road and absolutely cannot be followed. From now on, I will resolutely follow the socialist road with everyone and obey the leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the cooperative.

    办建设社会主义的事要热爱社会主义的人
    领导合作社离不开贫雇农
    京郊军民友谊社辩倒了富裕中农的错误言论
    本报讯　贫雇农能不能领导合作社？这是北京市丰台区看丹乡军民友谊社大辩论中一个尖锐的问题。提出这个问题的是第三生产队富裕中农陈惠光。在9月间一次大鸣大放的中农座谈会上，陈惠光同他本家富裕中农陈登科、陈武光、下中农陈文光一起攻击党在农村中的阶级政策，认为贫雇农不能领导合作社，理由是“贫雇农过去都是种二、三亩地的人，没本事，没经验，现在要他们领导合作社一管就是几千亩，简直是笑话。”同时，他们竭力夸耀富裕中农的本领，意思是要让他们来领导农业社。经过六次辩论大会，社员们摆出许多事实，攻破了陈惠光等人的谬论。
    当辩论到“贫雇农能不能领导合作社”的时候，参加辩论会的人比往常更加踊跃，会场空气也更加紧张，社员们抢着报名发言。当过长工的王德泉用反问的方式进行反驳。他说：“陈惠光，你说贫雇农地少没有经验，因此不能领导合作社，你的意思是富裕中农有经验，应该让富裕中农领导合作社。可是我要说你们的经验的确是有的，但这只是走资本主义道路的经验。我看要是让你们领导，准把大伙领到资本主义老路去，免不了大伙再当长工，受压迫。我们能要这种领导吗？贫雇农缺的是土地，有的是本领，过去受压迫，现在翻了身，坚决拥护社会主义，因此脚跟站的稳，不怕困难，他们不能领导合作社，还有谁能领导呢？”杨永祥说：
  “要说过去穷人没本事，是因为那时没土地、没农具、没牲口，只得给地主扛长工。今天贫雇农翻身当家作主了，合作社只有翻了身的人才能领导，这可不能含糊！”
    张国友不等杨永祥话落音，紧接着说：“贫雇农能不能领导合作社？还得看事实，远的不说，人人都知道去年我们这里遭了多么大的涝灾，我们的合作社碰到多么大的困难，可是，我们终于战胜了灾荒，把合作社巩固下来，这不是贫雇农出身的社干部领导的是谁领导的，你说说这究竟算有本领还是没本领呢？别说地主富农，就是你们这些富裕中农有这种本领吗？”
    提起去年的大涝灾，人们记忆犹新。社员们描述着去年的情景：正当紧张的秋收季节，一连下了好多天大雨，到处汪洋一片，房子被水淹没了半截子。在这场严重的灾害面前，贫雇农出身的社干部，表现了顽强的战斗精神，他们七天七夜不眠不休地和洪水战斗。贫农出身的社主任田宝荣，黑夜里领着一百多人挖排水沟，当时堰沟被水冲坏，他立即躺下去用身子堵住缺口。武福民虽然是只有一条腿的残废人，但他还是积极指挥社员排水抢救，一直坚持到洪水退去。可是就在这个灾难的日子里，陈惠光等富裕中农却一连两、三个月躲在屋里，不但没有出来和水灾斗争，反而影响了三十多户富裕中农要求退社。到了今年春天青黄不接的时候，社干部又领导大家搞副业，组织了六十多辆大车搞运输，领导一部分社员抢种蔬菜，大家都积极想办法克服困难。贫农田宝顺、孙庆元每天啃窝头、吃咸菜，从来没有向社里要求补助，表示死也不退社。这时富裕中农怎么样呢？张仁信就是一个例子，他每天叫喊困难，向社里要钱，拿到了三十元钱，却买了一个放衣服用的大木箱。今年麦收时，社里富裕中农朱正贵，煽动贫农出身的生产队长杜德春向社要求多留麦子，杜德春回答他：我坚决服从社管理委员会的决定，我们不能只顾个人利益。
    在这些活生生的事实面前，陈惠光认了输。他向大伙检讨说：我满脑子装的都是资本主义思想，看问题同大家不是一条路子，这回大家对我的帮助，好像钥匙开了锁，我看清了资本主义是黑暗的道路，绝对走不通。今后坚决跟大家一道走社会主义的道路，服从社里贫雇农领导。
