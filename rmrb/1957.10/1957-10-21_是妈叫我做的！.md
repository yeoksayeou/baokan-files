    “Mom Told Me to Do It!”
    Liu Zigui
    My dad died when I was very young. Mom raised our family from hunger and cold with her hands that picked vegetables in the east and gathered firewood in the west. Now, we five brothers are cadres in government organs, teachers, farmers, and students. During holidays, those of us who are away from home try our best to go back and see Mom. This year for National Day, I once again trekked forty li of mountain road back home.
    What struck me as strange when I got home was that none of my older or younger brothers had returned. Before my butt even touched the heated brick bed, I asked Mom about it.
    Mom took out three letters from the cabinet and handed them to me, saying, “These are letters from the three of them. You’ll understand once you read them. They’re all busy outside; I’m not angry that they didn’t come home...”
    I took the three letters, opened them, and read them through. It turned out that my older brother, who is a teacher in Beijing, was leading students to the suburbs to help with the autumn harvest during the holidays; my older brother in Zhangwu was participating in the socialist great debate in the countryside; and my younger brother, who is in middle school, had also gone to the countryside to participate in production. I had no choice but to reunite with Mom and my second brother. I always thought Mom was an old person, and I could only talk to her about family matters; there were some things we couldn't discuss together. My second brother was busy harvesting crops all day long, and I felt out of place. I thought about visiting my aunt's house tomorrow.
    Mom made my favorite millet rice and boiled two salted duck eggs. When the steaming, golden millet rice was served, I realized it was cooked in a basin. I asked Mom, "Why not cook it in a pot?"
    "Doing it this way doesn't produce rice soup, saving grain," Mom said, looking into the basin.
    Millet rice and salted duck eggs – this was the most delicious meal I had eaten in months.
    After the meal, I was about to go out for a walk, but Mom stopped me:
      “Don’t go, I have something to tell you.”
    Mom threw the half-smoked pipe onto the heated brick bed and said:
  “Do you know? Our co-op is holding a debate these days. Debating whether collectivization is good or not? Whether there is enough food to eat? Your second brother told me after the meeting that Wang Rong, the rich peasant from the east courtyard, spoke for half a day by himself, insisting that there wasn't enough food to eat. He's lying through his teeth! Why does he say there isn't enough food to eat? It infuriated me! ... Tomorrow morning, go to the co-op and borrow a scale. Weigh all the sorghum, millet, and beans that our family of four has left over from eating for eleven and a half months, and make a list to send to Township Head Yang. Also, tell him that Wang Rong sold two loads of millet at the Xinqiu mine in July, both carried by donkeys!” Mom said all of this very excitedly. I nodded and accepted the task.
    The next morning, just as the people harvesting crops went to the fields, I followed Mom's instructions and weighed all the different kinds of grain in advance, making a list like this: one hundred and thirty-two catties of sorghum, eighty-seven catties of millet, nine catties of soybeans, and the remaining miscellaneous grains were not weighed.
    That day, the weather was fine. The weeds along both sides of the road to the township government were growing tall, and the dew on them, like tiny raindrops, soaked my feet as I walked. Holding the list in my hand, I felt that some of my vague ideas about the grain issue suddenly became clear. I truly knew who was opposing the unified purchase and sale of grain.
    The township government was also on holiday, but the township Party secretary and the township head were still there studying their work. When they saw me, they warmly shook my hand. I quickly took out the list from my pocket, handed it to Township Head Yang, explained my intention, and also described Wang Rong's grain selling. After Township Head Yang finished reading the list, he tightly gripped my hand again, saying excitedly, "Old Liu! Thank you! Thank you for your help!"
    My face suddenly flushed. I quickly said, "No! It wasn't me, Mom told me to do it!"

    “是妈叫我做的！”
    刘子贵
    我很小的时候爸就死去了。妈凭着她那双东掳菜、西拣柴的手把我们一家人从饥寒中养大。现在我们哥儿五个有机关干部、教员、农民、学生，逢到节日我们几个在外边的都尽量回家看看妈妈。今年国庆节，我又步陟四十里的山路回家来。
    到了家使我异常奇怪的是哥哥弟弟们都没有回家。我的屁股还没有沾炕就问起妈来。
    妈从柜里掏出三封信递给我说：“这是他们三个来的信，你一看就知道了，他们在外边都忙，不回家我也不生气。……”
    我接过这三封信，拆开看了一遍。原来，在北京当教员的哥哥在假期要领着学生到市郊帮助秋收；在彰武的哥哥下乡参加社会主义大辩论；在中学念书的小弟弟也下乡参加生产了。我只好和妈妈、二哥团聚了。我总以为妈妈是老年人，只能和她诉些家常，有些话是说不到一起，二哥又整天的忙着割庄稼，呆的怪不得劲的，我想明天去姑母家串门。
    妈妈给我做了最爱吃的小米饭，另外还煮上了两个咸鸭蛋。当热气腾腾金黄的小米饭盛上来的时候我才看出是用盆闷的，我问妈妈：“为啥不用锅闷呢？”
    “这样做，不出饭?，节省粮食。”妈妈说完往盆里看了看。
    小米饭、咸鸭蛋，这还是我几个月来吃得最香的一顿饭。
    饭后，我正想出去走走，妈妈却喊住了我：
      “你别走，有点事和你说说。”
    妈把没有抽透的烟袋扔到炕上说：
  “你知道不？咱们社里这几天正开辩论会。辩论合作化好不好？吃粮够不够？你二哥开会回来告诉我，东院富农王荣，他一个人就说了半天，硬说粮食不够吃，他净灭着良心眼子说话，他凭啥说粮食不够吃？真把我的肺都气炸了！……你明天早晨到社里借个秤，把咱家四口人吃十一个半月剩的高粮、小米、豆子都秤一秤，拉成清单给杨乡长送去。另外你再告诉他，王荣今年7月上新丘矿卖两趟小米，都是使毛驴驮去的！”妈妈的这一番话说得十分激动，我点了点头，接受了这个任务。
    第二天清早，割庄稼的人们刚下地，我按照妈妈的吩咐提前把各样的粮食秤好，拉成这样一个清单：高粮一百三十二斤、小米八十七斤、大豆九斤，其余的杂粮都没秤。
    这天，天气晴好，去乡政府大道上两旁的野草长的长长的，那上面小雨点似的露水被脚一趟都淋落在脚上。我手拿着清单感到自己对粮食问题的一些模糊思想一下子清醒过来了，我真正知道谁在反对粮食统购统销。
    乡政府本来也正放假，但是乡支书和乡长还都在那里研究工作。他们看到我来，热情地跟我握手。我忙从兜里掏出清单递给杨乡长，说明了来意，又介绍了王荣卖粮的情况。杨乡长看完清单又重新紧紧地握住我的手激动地说：“老刘！谢谢你！谢谢你对我们的帮助！”
    我的脸忽地一下子热起来。我忙说“不！这不是我，是妈叫我做的！”
