    From Swaying to Correctness
    Wen Ze
    From last winter to this spring, capitalist ideology reared its head in the countryside. In many places, incidents of demanding withdrawal from cooperatives and food shortages occurred. Many grassroots cadres felt helpless in the face of these events and attempted to resolve them with simple and crude methods of suppression, leading to a rise in commandism and crude work styles among rural cadres in many areas.

    In March, after the dissemination of Chairman Mao's instructions on "Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People," this phenomenon of commandism significantly changed. However, another deviation arose, namely, regarding all problems as contradictions among the people, even treating the anti-socialist sabotage activities of landlords and rich peasants as contradictions among the people, and daring not to carry out severe struggles and handle them according to the law. They also dared not to criticize the serious capitalist tendencies of some well-to-do middle peasants. The tailism of a one-sided mass perspective raised its head again. In some places, some masses even treated cadres with crude attitudes. Coupled with the attacks of landlords, rich peasants, and urban rightists, many rural cadres felt extremely aggrieved.

    Upon hearing that socialist education was to be carried out in the countryside and a struggle against the capitalist road was to be launched, many grassroots cadres mistakenly thought that the topic of "handling contradictions among the people" was about to be changed, mistakenly believing that it was time to "vent their anger," attempting to shift from tailism back to the old path of commandism.

    Neither commandism nor tailism, what is the correct approach then? The experience of the past two or three months has proven that the best method is to engage in extensive airing of views, big debates, and writing of big-character posters. Mobilize the masses to express their opinions and bring up all the problems, and then use the method of presenting facts and reasoning, fully utilizing the consciousness and wisdom of the masses to solve the problems. This is neither forced suppression nor laissez-faire indulgence, but a truly mass-line method of persuasion and education. For many years, many rural cadres have wavered between commandism and tailism. This time, they have finally found the correct method.

    The experience of many places has proven that educating and helping rural grassroots cadres learn this method of extensive airing of views, big debates, and big-character posters is a good way to strengthen political and ideological work in the countryside, which we have explored in practice. It is also a good way to transform the work style of grassroots cadres, which is the mass-line working method repeatedly emphasized by the Party. We should fully value this significant gain, fully recognize the importance of extensive airing of views, big debates, and big-character posters. Earnestly carrying out extensive airing of views, big debates, and big-character posters in all rural areas across the country is not only for the purpose of enhancing the socialist awareness of the broad masses of peasants, but also for greatly improving the ideological level of grassroots cadres and greatly improving their working methods and work styles, laying a reliable foundation for further promoting the cooperative movement and developing agricultural production.

    从摇摆到正确
    文则
    去年冬天到今年春天，资本主义思想在农村抬头，好些地方发生了闹退社和闹缺粮的事件，不少基层干部对这种事情感到没有办法，企图用简单粗暴的压服的办法来解决，因而在好些农村干部的强迫命令、简单粗暴的作风抬头了。
    三月间，传达毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的指示以后，这种强迫命令的现象有显著改变。但是，又发生了另外一种偏向，就是把一切问题都看作是人民内部矛盾问题，甚至把地主富农的反社会主义的破坏活动，也当成人民内部矛盾问题，不敢进行严厉斗争和依法处理。对于某些富裕中农的严重的资本主义思想，也不敢进行批判。片面群众观点的尾巴主义又抬头了。某些地方反而发生某些群众用粗暴态度对待干部的现象。加上地富分子配合城市右派分子的进攻，很多农村干部憋了一肚子气。
    这次一听说要在农村进行社会主义教育，开展反对资本主义路线的斗争，很多基层干部又错以为“处理人民内部矛盾”的题目又要换了，错认为“出气”的时候到了，企图又从尾巴主义转过来，回到强迫命令主义的老路上去。
    既不能命令主义，又不能尾巴主义，究竟正确的办法是什么呢？近两三个月来的经验证明，最好的办法就是大鸣大放大争。发动群众把意见都说出来，把问题都拿出来，然后用摆事实、讲道理的办法，充分运用群众的觉悟和智慧来解决问题。这就既不是强迫压服、又不是放任纵容而是真正群众路线的说服教育的办法。多少年来，很多农村干部摇摆在命令主义和尾巴主义之间，这一次才算找到了正确的办法。
    好些地方的经验证明，教育和帮助农村基层干部学会这个大鸣大放大争的办法，就是我们在实践中摸索出来的加强农村政治思想工作的好办法，又是转变基层干部工作作风的好办法，也就是党的一再强调的群众路线的工作方法。我们应该充分重视这个重大的收获，充分认识大鸣大放大争的重要意义。认真在全国各农村开展大鸣大放大争，不只是为了目前可以提高广大农民群众的社会主义觉悟，而且可以大大地提高基层干部的思想水平和大大地改进他们的工作方法和工作作风，为进一步推进合作化运动和发展农业生产打下可靠的基础。
