Unity is Strength
By People's Daily Commentator

The United States once attempted to use the United Nations General Assembly to conduct smear propaganda against Syria, but contrary to what the United States had hoped, the UN General Assembly became a forum for Arab countries to unanimously condemn the United States' aggressive actions against Syria. The unity of the Arab countries has demonstrated great strength, putting the American aggressors in a difficult and awkward position.

Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly on the 7th, strongly condemning Dulles' slander against Syria at the assembly. Bitar forcefully exposed the economic, financial, political, and military pressure exerted by the United States to force Syria to submit to it, and pointed out that the U.S. policy is a new form of colonialism. Bitar incisively pointed out that Dulles fears Arab liberation and unity; and the United States' spreading of rumors that Syria threatens others is an attempt to legitimize U.S. hostility and threats against Syria with such a statement. Bitar reiterated that Syria pursues a policy of peaceful neutrality.

Prior to this, Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi, in his speech at the UN General Assembly on the 3rd, specifically addressed the issue of aggression against Syria. Fawzi solemnly pointed out that Syria's strengthening of its national defense is entirely within its rights. He declared that Syria is Egypt's ally, flesh and blood. Egypt will not allow aggressors to harm a single fingertip or a single hair on Syria, and it will stand firmly with Syria.

On the same day, Iraqi representative to the UN General Assembly, Shabandar, also condemned colonialists at the assembly for using the so-called opposition to "Communist infiltration activities" as a pretext for their sinister attempts.

Of particular note was the speech delivered by Saudi Arabian Minister of State Shukeiry to the UN General Assembly on the 2nd. While comprehensively criticizing Western colonialism's aggression against the Middle East, Shukeiry refuted the United States' slander against Syria and strongly condemned interference in Syria's internal affairs, opposing the United States' unreasonable demand to discuss the Syrian situation.

Shukeiry's speech was widely regarded as another sign that Arab unity is strengthening, following Saudi Arabian King Saud's visit to Syria. As everyone knows, after the failure of British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt, the United States has been propagating that Saudi Arabia has accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and has blatantly undermined the relationship between Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria in order to achieve the goal of dividing the Arab world. Therefore, the improvement of relations between Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria, and the strengthening of Arab unity, makes the United States very uneasy. The United States attempts to portray Saudi Arabia's support for Syria as merely a gesture to maintain Arab unity.

However, on October 5, the Saudi Arabian government issued a statement formally denying that Saudi Arabia had accepted the Eisenhower Doctrine. This statement further eliminated the differences between Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, further strengthening Arab unity. At the same time, this statement is also a heavy blow to the United States' divide-and-rule colonialist policy. Saudi Arabia's attitude, which is beneficial to Arab unity, is welcome.

Faced with this situation, the United States cannot but restrain itself on the surface. The clamor against Syria has gradually subsided. But Eisenhower said on the 3rd that the United States will further observe the "evolution" of the Syrian situation, and disagreed with Shukeiry's opinion, believing that the Syrian situation is not an internal affair, but something that the United States can interfere with, although he calls this interference "concern." Eisenhower also stated that the United States will cooperate with "others" in military and economic aspects to carry out intervention. It can be seen that the United States has not abandoned its aggressive conspiracy against Syria. It is just observing the situation, waiting for an opportunity to act.

Therefore, Syria and other Arab countries still need to maintain a high degree of vigilance, especially to strengthen unity and strictly guard against the United States' conspiracies to provoke and undermine. Unity is strength. This strength has already overwhelmed the United States' warmongering clamor in the UN General Assembly and will also shatter any aggressive conspiracy of the United States against Middle Eastern countries.

    团结就是力量

    美国曾经企图利用联合国大会来进行对叙利亚的诬蔑宣传，但是和美国所希望的相反，联合国大会成了阿拉伯国家一致谴责美国对叙利亚的侵略行为的讲坛。阿拉伯国家的团结显示出了强大的力量，使得美国侵略者处于很难招架的窘境。
    叙利亚外交部长比塔尔7日在联合国大会上发表演说，强烈地谴责了杜勒斯在大会上对叙利亚的诬蔑。比塔尔有力地揭露了美国为了使叙利亚屈从于美国而施加的经济上、财政上、政治上和军事上的压力，并且指出美国的政策是一种新形式的殖民主义。比塔尔一针见血地指出，杜勒斯害怕阿拉伯的解放和团结；而美国散布硬说叙利亚威胁别人的谰言，是企图用这样一种说法来使美国对叙利亚的仇视和威胁行动成为合法。比塔尔重申，叙利亚所奉行的是和平中立的政策。
    在此以前，埃及外交部长法齐在3日联合国大会上发表演说的时候，特别谈到对叙利亚的侵略的问题。法齐严正地指出，叙利亚加强自己的国防，完全是它有权做的事情。他宣布，叙利亚是埃及的盟国，是埃及的骨肉。埃及决不允许侵略者损伤叙利亚的一个手指尖或者一根头发，它将同叙利亚坚定地站在一起。
    同一天，伊拉克出席联合国大会的代表沙班达尔，也在大会上谴责殖民主义者用所谓反对“共产党渗透活动”作为他们的罪恶企图的借口。
    特别引起人们注意的是出席联合国大会的沙特阿拉伯国务大臣舒凯里2日发表的演说。舒凯里在全面抨击西方殖民主义对中东的侵略的时候，驳斥了美国对叙利亚的污蔑，并且强烈谴责对叙利亚内政的干涉，反对美国提出的讨论叙利亚局势的无理要求。
    舒凯里的发言受到了普遍的重视，认为这是继沙特阿拉伯国王沙特访问叙利亚以后，说明阿拉伯团结正在加强的又一个迹象。大家知道，在英、法、以色列侵略埃及失败以后，美国一直在宣传沙特阿拉伯接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”，并且露骨地破坏沙特阿拉伯同埃及、叙利亚的关系，以达到分裂阿拉伯世界的目的。因此，沙特阿拉伯同埃及、叙利亚关系的改善，阿拉伯国家团结的加强，使得美国十分不安。美国企图把沙特阿拉伯对叙利亚的支持，说成仅仅是一种维护阿拉伯团结的姿态。
    但是，10月5日，沙特阿拉伯政府发表声明，正式否认沙特阿拉伯已经接受艾森豪威尔主义。这个声明进一步消除了沙特阿拉伯同其他阿拉伯国家之间的分歧，使得阿拉伯团结进一步增强。同时，这个声明也是对于美国的分而治之的殖民主义政策的沉重打击。沙特阿拉伯这种有利于阿拉伯团结的态度，是值得欢迎的。
    面对着这种情况，美国在表面上不能不有所收敛。反对叙利亚的叫嚣声逐渐低沉下来了。但是艾森豪威尔在3日说，美国还要进一步看一看叙利亚局势的“演变”，并且表示不同意舒凯里的意见，认为叙利亚的局势不是内政，而是美国可以干涉的事情，虽然他把这种干涉称之为“关心”。艾森豪威尔并且表示，美国将在军事、经济方面同“别人”合作来进行干涉。可见，美国对叙利亚的侵略阴谋并没有放弃。它不过是在观风察色，待机而动罢了。
    因此，叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家仍然需要保持高度的警惕，特别要加强团结，严防美国挑拨破坏的阴谋。团结就是力量。这种力量已经在联合国大会上压倒了美国的好战叫嚣，也将粉碎美国对中东国家的任何侵略阴谋。
