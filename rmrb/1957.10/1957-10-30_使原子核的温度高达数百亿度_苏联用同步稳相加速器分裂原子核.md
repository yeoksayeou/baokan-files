Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: TASS reports: Soviet scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research have recently used protons accelerated by a synchrophasotron to bombard atomic nuclei, raising the temperature of the nuclei to tens of billions of degrees, higher than the temperature of luminous stars. This caused the nuclear force to be unable to hold protons and neutrons within the atomic nucleus, resulting in the phenomenon of atomic nuclear fission.

Soviet Deputy Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, Tolstov, recently spoke to "Pravda" reporter Kapelin about this phenomenon, which is of great significance in atomic physics research. Kapelin's article, published in "Pravda" on the 28th, described the research work conducted by the institute using the synchrophasotron.

Kapelin wrote that scientists used this accelerator to give hydrogen nuclei—protons—a velocity corresponding to an energy of 10 billion electron volts. Physicists also used special photographic plates coated with a thick layer of highly sensitive emulsion to record the traces of "elementary" particles. One photograph, magnified thousands of times, shows the path of a proton accelerated in the accelerator to 9 billion electron volts, indicated by a dotted line. The particle collides with stationary protons contained within the emulsion itself. The extremely strong impact concentrates enormous energy within a very small volume, producing other "elementary" particles—mesons. Their traces form a "star shape," with rays fanning out.

Tolstov said that the traces of elementary particles reveal the nature of changes within the microscopic world and help to clarify the laws governing the interaction of high-energy particles. He said that when accelerated protons collide with the nuclei of elements such as silver, bromine, and oxygen that make up the emulsion, mesons are produced inside the atomic nuclei. Some of the mesons are absorbed by the nucleus or diffuse within it, resulting in the atomic nucleus acquiring enormous energy, thereby raising the temperature of the nucleus to tens of billions of degrees.

    使原子核的温度高达数百亿度
    苏联用同步稳相加速器分裂原子核
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联联合原子核研究所科学家最近利用同步稳相加速器加速的质子，轰击原子核，使核的温度达到了比发光恒星的温度还要高的数百亿度高温，从而使核子力无法把质子和中子保持在原子核内，产生了原子核分裂的现象。
    苏联物理数学副博士托尔斯托夫最近对“真理报”记者卡佩林谈到了这个在原子物理学研究中有巨大意义的现象。“真理报”28日发表的卡佩林的文章叙述了这个研究所利用同步稳相加速器进行的研究工作。
    卡佩林写道，科学家们利用这个加速器使氢原子核——质子获得了能量为一百亿电子伏特的速度。物理学家还用涂有厚厚一层敏感度极高的乳胶的特种底片，将“基本”粒子的踪迹记录了下来。有一张相片把在加速器中加速到九十亿电子伏特的质子的踪迹放大数千倍拍了下来，从相片上可以看出虚线所表示出的这个极微小的粒子走过的道路。粒子同乳胶本身所含的不动的质子相碰。极为强烈的冲击使很小的容积内聚集了极大的能量，产生了另外的“基本”粒子——介子。它们的踪迹形成“星状”，星芒呈扇形。　　托尔斯托夫说，基本粒子的痕迹揭示出微观世界内部变化的性质，有助于弄清高能量粒子相互作用的规律性。他说，当加速了的质子同组成乳胶的银、溴、氧等元素的原子核撞击时，原子核内部就产生了介子。有一部分介子被核吸收或者扩散于核内，结果原子核就获得了巨大的能量，从而使核的温度达到数百亿度。
