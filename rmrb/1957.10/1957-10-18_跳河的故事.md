　　The Story of Jumping into the River
　　On the way from Chaoxian County to work in Daishan Township, we were chatting with several township and commune cadres. A township Party branch secretary told a story about jumping into the river:
　　“It’s really funny to talk about it! One afternoon I was drafting a plan for accumulating fertilizer at the township government when the woman from the Lao Shen family came running to the township government again. She shouted that I should give her food rations, saying: ‘The food ration is really not enough! If you cadres don’t think of a way for me, my family will have nothing to cook, and we’ll starve to death!’” The township Party branch secretary said, smiling at us, and then continued, “So I went over the accounts with her again. Her family is a prosperous middle peasant, with 480 jin of food rations allocated to them. They also have about 200 jin of miscellaneous grains from their private plot and grain from increased production returned to the team. How could it not be enough to eat? But no matter what I said, it didn't work. Later, I had to go to a meeting, so I left. She kept following me and shouting behind me, finally saying: ‘If you really don’t solve this for me, I’ll just have to die.’ As soon as she said that, she pretended to jump into the small river next to the road.”
　　Hearing this, I was suddenly startled. It seemed as if a village woman about to jump into the river was standing right in front of me, so I anxiously asked, "What happened?"
　　“The slope was too steep, and she really slipped down, but luckily the river wasn’t deep, and the water only soaked the lower half of her clothes. I quickly pulled her ashore and sent several female commune members to comfort her and help her go home to change her wet clothes. As soon as they got to her house, the female commune members hurriedly opened her wardrobe. At first, she kept shouting not to open it, ah! There was a large basket of snow-white rice, more than a shi, and a large bag of wheat."
　　"The woman from the Lao Shen family looked at the big pile of grain in her house, sat there without saying a word, and after a while, she started beating her legs, wailing and crying...."

　　跳河的故事
    在离开巢县去到岱山乡工作的路上，我们同几个乡、社干部在一块闲扯，有个乡支部书记讲了一件跳河的故事：
    “说起来才好笑哩！那一天下午我正在乡政府草拟积肥的计划，老沈家的女人又跑到乡政府来了，她嚷着要我发给她粮票，说：口粮真不够吃呀！你们干部们再不给我想点办法，我家揭不开锅啦，要饿死人了！”乡支部书记说着向我们微笑了一下，然后又说：“我就又给她算了算细账，她家是富裕中农，四百八十斤口粮到户，自留地的杂粮以及增产归队的粮食还有二百来斤，怎么会不够吃？可是怎么说也不行，后来我要去开会，就走了，她还是一个劲地一路跟着我在后边叫，最后说：‘你们真不给我解决，我只好去死’。话刚落音，她装着真的向路旁的小河里跳。”
    我听了心里猛一愣，眼前好像就站着那么一个要跳河的村妇，于是我着急地问：“怎么啦？”
    “坡太陡，真的滑下去了，好在河水不深，水只是浸湿了她下半身的衣服。我赶忙把她拉上岸，派了几个女社员一面劝慰她，一面扶她回家去换一换湿淋淋的衣服。一到她家，几个女社员匆忙地帮她打开衣柜，起初她还嚷嚷着不让打开，啊！一大箩雪白的米足有一石多，还有一大袋小麦。”
    “老沈家的女人望着自家这一大堆粮食，坐在那里一言不发，停了一会她竟又拍打着双腿哭天哭地号叫起来了……。”
