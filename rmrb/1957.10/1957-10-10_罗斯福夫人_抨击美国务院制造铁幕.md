Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th. Eleanor Roosevelt said on the 8th that the U.S. State Department has "created an iron curtain on our side."

Mrs. Roosevelt had just returned from a visit to the Soviet Union. She said that the Soviet Union allows Americans to travel to the Soviet Union, but the State Department does not allow travelers from socialist countries to travel to the United States.

Mrs. Roosevelt also said that Soviet scientists are good scientists and that they were able to launch the first artificial satellite because they "pay more attention to research work than our government does."
