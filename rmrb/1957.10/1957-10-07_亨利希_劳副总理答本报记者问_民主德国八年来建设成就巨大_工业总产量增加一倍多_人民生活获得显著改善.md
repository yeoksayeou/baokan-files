(Berlin, October 6th, dispatch from our newspaper) Our newspaper reporter reports: On the eve of the eighth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and Domestic Trade of the German Democratic Republic, Heinrich Rau, issued a written statement to reporters, answering several questions posed by the reporter. The questions and answers are as follows:

Question: What are the most important achievements of the German Democratic Republic in the eight years since its founding?

Answer: Since its founding on October 7, 1949, the German Democratic Republic has achieved tremendous successes and continued to develop in all aspects of life, including the economy, science, culture, and health.

The most significant is the development of industry. In the short few years since the founding of the German Democratic Republic, total industrial output has more than doubled. Its total industrial output now ranks fifth among European countries. The German Democratic Republic now possesses a highly advanced and efficient machine manufacturing industry. It is the second largest machine manufacturing and exporting country in all socialist countries, second only to the Soviet Union. In addition, we also have a strong chemical raw materials industry. Its output and value rank sixth in the world.

The German Democratic Republic's enormous industrial strength is also reflected in electricity production. Electricity production has roughly doubled in eight years. In 1956, we produced a total of 31.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is more than all of Germany produced in 1938. Calculated per capita, the German Democratic Republic's electricity production has exceeded highly developed capitalist countries such as Great Britain, France, and West Germany, and occupies a leading position among European countries.

Our republic's annual lignite production is 206 million tons, making it the world's largest lignite producing country.

Despite the above-mentioned achievements in industry, because the German Democratic Republic is a country relatively poor in raw materials, there are still serious imbalances and difficulties in the supply of raw materials in several industrial sectors. These difficulties are primarily reflected in the production of iron, steel, and non-ferrous metals. Production of hard coal and coke is also far from meeting needs. Although we produced approximately 2.7 million tons of steel and the same amount of hard coal in 1956, these quantities are still far from being sufficient to fully supply our machine manufacturing and other metal processing industries. However, thanks to the enormous assistance from socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, these difficulties have been greatly reduced.

Great achievements have also been made in agriculture, transportation, and in domestic and foreign trade. During the first Five-Year Plan from 1951 to 1955, agricultural production increased by 44%. The total volume of foreign trade of the German Democratic Republic has more than doubled since 1950. The People's Republic of China occupies an important position in our republic's foreign trade sector. The exchange of goods between the two countries has increased by more than two and a half times from 1951 to 1956. This trade is of great economic significance to our republic.

The above-mentioned achievements and developments should primarily be attributed to the enormous efforts of the working class and all working people under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Workers' and Peasants' Government. As a result of this satisfactory development, the German Democratic Republic enjoys growing trust and international prestige both among socialist countries and in many non-socialist countries.

Question: In terms of economic construction, what original difficulties have been overcome in industry over the past eight years thanks to the successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan and the effective implementation of the second Five-Year Plan?

Answer: The main task facing the working class of the German Democratic Republic at that time was to heal the wounds of war and eliminate the terrible vestiges of fascism in all sectors of life, while at the same time creating the foundation for socialist construction. In the political sphere, this meant democratizing all aspects of social life, establishing a new state apparatus of workers and peasants, and reforming schools, culture, science, etc. on a completely new basis (as a possible starting point for socialist development). The working class of the German Democratic Republic comprehensively completed this task in alliance with all strata of the working people.

In the economic sphere, this meant realizing socialist industrialization, technically re-adjusting industry, the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the comprehensive reorganization of transportation, domestic trade, foreign trade, and other economic sectors.

The basic task of the German Democratic Republic in the first few years after its founding was to establish its own heavy industry, and in particular to establish efficient medium-sized and heavy machine manufacturing. These tasks were basically resolved during the first Five-Year Plan and the beginning of the second Five-Year Plan. The total industrial output of the German Democratic Republic in 1949 was only about 87% of the total industrial output in 1936, but by 1956 it had reached 224%. The German Democratic Republic produced only about one million tons of steel in 1950, but it had reached 2.7 million tons in 1956. Cement production was 1.4 million tons in 1950, but it had reached 3.4 million tons in 1956. Lignite production was 140 million tons in 1950, but it had reached 208.6 million tons in 1956.

During the first Five-Year Plan, the German Democratic Republic had already laid the foundation for heavy industry and efficient machine manufacturing. During this period, we established brand new iron and steel plants, heavy machine manufacturing enterprises, automobile and tractor factories, shipyards, etc. These enterprises enable the German Democratic Republic to have a fairly high level this year in the manufacturing of power machinery, machine tools, textile machinery, mining and metallurgical equipment, chemical industry equipment, as well as transportation vehicles and agricultural machinery. Therefore, the German Democratic Republic possesses all the decisive prerequisites for building a socialist economy and society, and makes the German Democratic Republic a model for the development of the whole of Germany and a base for the German people's struggle for unification.

Question: Please talk about the situation of the improvement of people's living standards in the past eight years.

Answer: To answer this question, I can list some figures. During the period from 1951 to 1955, national income had increased to 162%. The real wages of workers, the income of peasants, and the purchasing power of residents have been greatly increased through systematic wage increases, tax reductions, and seventeen price reductions. The basis for this improvement is that labor productivity increased by 47% during the first Five-Year Plan. Through the increase in the efficiency of industry and agriculture, and especially through the increase in market production, the variety of commodities has been greatly increased, thereby greatly improving the material and cultural living standards of the residents of our republic. The improvement of the living standards of the residents of the German Democratic Republic is also reflected in the tremendous progress in cultural, social, and health welfare undertakings. From 1951 to 1955, the state budget spent a total of 51.3 billion marks on national education, science, culture, social, and health welfare undertakings. The number of university students increased from 31,500 in 1951 to 80,500 in 1956. The number of nursery beds for children under three years old increased from 4,700 to 45,400 during the same period. A wide range of outpatient medical institutions have been established in the German Democratic Republic. As of the end of 1955, there were 1,137 sanatoriums and nursing homes. All these institutions prove that the working people of our republic receive good care. It also proves that the German Democratic Republic is a true socialist state of workers and peasants.

The workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the German Democratic Republic are fully aware of these facts. Therefore, they have undertaken huge labor obligations to strengthen and consolidate our republic, and welcome the eighth anniversary of the founding of their country with new labor enthusiasm and political fervor. They are determined to pave the way for the progress and socialism of the whole of Germany, and to strive for the reunification of the German nation into a peace-loving Germany. For the cause of peace and happiness of mankind, the working people of the German Democratic Republic firmly stand on the side of all socialist countries and peace-loving forces in the world.

    亨利希·劳副总理答本报记者问
    民主德国八年来建设成就巨大
    工业总产量增加一倍多　人民生活获得显著改善
    本报柏林6日专电　本报记者报道：德意志民主共和国副总理兼对外与国内贸易部部长亨利希·劳在德意志民主共和国国庆八周年前夕对记者发表书面谈话，就记者提出的几个问题作了答复。问答如下：
    问：德意志民主共和国成立八年来最主要的成就是什么？
    答：德意志民主共和国自从1949年10月7日成立以来，已经在经济、科学、文化、卫生等一切生活部门中取得了巨大的成就，并继续向前发展着。
    最显著的是工业的发展。在德意志民主共和国成立以来短短几年中，工业总产量已经增加了一倍以上。它的工业总产量现在占欧洲各国的第五位。德意志民主共和国现在拥有一个具有高度水平和效率卓越的机器制造业。在所有社会主义国家中是仅次于苏联的第二个最大的机器制造和出口国家。此外，我们还拥有强大的化学原料工业。它的产量和产值在全世界占第六位。
    德意志民主共和国的巨大工业力量也表现在电力产量中。八年来电力产量大约增加了一倍。1956年我们共生产了三百一十二亿瓩时的电力，这个数字比1938年全德国生产的电力还要多。如按人口比例计算，德意志民主共和国的电力生产已超过英国、法国、西德等高度发达的资本主义国家，而在欧洲国家中占据首要地位。
    我们共和国的褐煤年产量为二亿零六百万吨，从而使它成为世界上最大的褐煤生产国家。
    尽管在工业上取得上述成就，但是由于德意志民主共和国是一个原料相当贫乏的国家，因此在若干工业部门中在原料的供应上还有着严重的不协调现象和困难。这些困难首先表现在铁、钢和有色金属的生产上。在硬煤和焦炭生产上也还远赶不上需要。1956年虽然我们生产了约二百七十万吨钢和同等数量的硬煤，但是这些数量还远不能充分供应我们的机器制造业和其他金属加工业。可是由于社会主义国家，首先是苏联和中华人民共和国的巨大援助，使得这种和那种困难大大地减少了。
    在农业、交通业以及在国内和国外贸易中也获得了巨大的成就。在1951至1955年的第一个五年计划期间，农业生产增加了44％。德意志民主共和国的对外贸易总额在1950年以后增加了二倍以上。中华人民共和国在我们共和国的对外贸易部门中占据一个重要的位置。两国的货物交换在1951至1956年期间已经增加到两倍半以上。这种贸易对我们共和国具有巨大的经济意义。
    上述成就和发展，首先应该感谢在德国统一社会党和工农政府领导之下的工人阶级和全体劳动人民的巨大努力。由于这种圆满发展的结果，使得德意志民主共和国既能在各社会主义国家中又能在许多非社会主义国家中享有日益增长的信任和国际威信。
    问：在经济建设方面，由于第一个五年计划的胜利完成和第二个五年计划的有效执行，八年来在工业上已经克服了哪些原有的困难？
    答：摆在德意志民主共和国工人阶级面前的主要任务，当时是医治战争创伤和消除所有生活部门中的可怕的法西斯主义的遗毒，而同时为社会主义建设创造基础。在政治领域中这就是意味着使全部社会生活民主化，建立一个新的工农国家机构，在崭新的基础上（作为社会主义发展的可能的起点）改革学校、文化、科学等等。德意志民主共和国的工人阶级在同劳动人民各阶层的联盟中全盘地完成了这个任务。
    在经济领域中，这就是意味着实现社会主义工业化在技术上重新调整工业、农业的社会主义改造和交通运输业、国内贸易、国外贸易以及其他经济部门的全盘的重新改组。
    德意志民主共和国在成立后头几年的基本任务是建立自己的重工业，而特别是建立效率强的中型和重型机器制造业。这些任务在第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划开始的期间基本上解决了。德意志民主共和国的工业总产量在1949年还只等于1936年工业总产量的约87％，而到1956年却已达到224％。德意志民主共和国在1950年还只生产钢约一百万吨，而在1956年却已达到二百七十万吨。水泥产量1950年是一百四十万吨，而在1956年却已达到三百四十万吨。褐煤产量在1950年是一亿四千万吨，而1956年却已达到二亿零八百六十万吨。
    在第一个五年计划期间，德意志民主共和国已经为重工业和高效率的机器制造业奠定了基础。在此期间，我们建立了崭新的炼铁厂和炼钢厂，重型机器制造企业，汽车厂和拖拉机厂，造船厂等等。这些企业使得德意志民主共和国今年能够在制造动力机器、机床、纺织机、采矿和冶金设备、化学工业设备以及交通工具、农业机器等方面具有相当高度的水平。因此使德意志民主共和国拥有建设社会主义经济和社会的一切决定性前提，并使德意志民主共和国成为全德国发展的榜样和使它成为德国民族争取统一斗争的基地。
    问：请谈一谈人民生活水平八年来提高的情形。
    答：为了答复这个问题，我可以列举一些数字。在1951至1955年期间国民收入已增至162％。工人的实际工资、农民的收入和居民的购买力已经通过有系统的工资提高、税收下减和十七次的降低物价而大大提高。构成这种提高的基础，是在第一个五年计划期间内劳动生产率增加了47％。通过工业和农业效率的增加而特别是通过市场生产的增加，使得商品的品种大大加多了，从而大大提高了我们共和国居民的物质和文化生活水平。德意志民主共和国居民生活水平的改善也表现在文化、社会和卫生等福利事业的巨大进展中。在1951至1955年中国家预算为国民教育、科学、文化、社会和卫生等福利事业共支出了五百一十三亿马克。大学生人数由1951年的三万一千五百人增加到1956年的八万零五百人。三岁以下儿童的托儿所床位在同一期间内由四千七百增加到四万五千四百。在德意志民主共和国建立了广泛的门诊医疗机构。截至1955年底，休养所和养老院已有一千一百三十七所。所有这些机构，证明了我们共和国的劳动人民所受到的照顾是良好的。它还证明德意志民主共和国是一个真正的工农社会国家。
    德意志民主共和国的工人农民和知识分子都能够完全认识到这些事实。因此他们都为加强和巩固我们的共和国而承担了巨大的劳动义务，并以新的劳动积极性和政治热情来迎接他们国家成立的八周年。他们决心要为全德国的进步和社会主义铺平道路，并为德国民族重新统一为一个爱好和平的德意志而奋斗。为了人类的和平和幸福事业，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民是坚决地站在所有社会主义国家和世界上爱好和平力量的一边的。
