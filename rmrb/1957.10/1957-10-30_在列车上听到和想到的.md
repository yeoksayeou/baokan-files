What I Heard and Thought on the Train
By Our Correspondent Lü Jianzhong

As soon as the train on the South Tongpu Line started from Taiyuan, I took out my notes, which were excerpts from the reports of various counties to the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. I wanted to calmly think about some issues in the current rural rectification movement in Shanxi Province that I hadn't yet clarified in my mind.

But I couldn't concentrate because the fellow villagers from Shanxi in the carriage were talking too enthusiastically and attractively. It seemed to me that what they were discussing was closely related to what I was pondering. So, I listened attentively to the conversation of the farmers sitting next to me.

	"To say we don't have enough to eat would be dishonest. Since the great debate in our village, we'd rather eat 400 jin than 420 jin."
	"It's not a shortage of grain, it's a shortage of money."
	"Money? What's the use of money? Going to the black market is illegal, buying meat is not frugal. Anyway, it's not up to you."
	"When Yan Xishan was here, if you borrowed one dou of wheat, you paid back three dou in the autumn. That was up to you!"
	"What about the commune cadres? Should they be more special than the members? … Sigh, I joined the commune with my gold chopsticks and silver bowls, thinking I'd have plenty to eat and wear from then on. It's socialism after all!"
	"That's not right either. Even if the commune cadres are selfish, we can't just think of ourselves and not care about the country."

At this point, the old farmer, around fifty years old, sitting across from me was also very interested in this little debate. He occasionally turned back and smiled at me, implying: "You see, this problem exists everywhere, not just in our village."

He was an old poor peasant from Pingyao County named Duan Yunbao. He said that during the Anti-Japanese War, he participated in the Dare-to-Die Corps led by Comrade Bo Yibo, fought against the Japanese devils, and also fought against Yan Xishan. Now that there are cooperatives, his life, though not very rich, is still enough to eat and use. This year, the crops suffered from drought, and the cooperative had problems in its management, leading to a slight decrease in production. The well-to-do middle peasants took this opportunity to stir up trouble. Duan Yunbao kindly offered suggestions to the commune cadres, but instead, he was suppressed. So, the well-to-do middle peasants took the opportunity to win him over. He was angry and distressed, not knowing what to do. He ran to the Taiyuan Railway Bureau to seek advice from his son. His son encouraged him to go back to the village and participate in the great debate properly. As he spoke, he rolled up his sleeves and showed me the scars on his arms, saying, "I understand what I was fighting for when I risked my life with Yan Xishan! Can we let those landlords and well-to-do middle peasants undermine the foundations of socialism?"

Later, when I went through several carriages to the dining car to eat, I consciously paid attention. In every carriage, I could hear people talking about grain, cooperatives, socialism, and so on.

But why are some local cadres afraid of debate meetings or worried that the masses won't be able to debate? Let's look at the records in my notebook:

	Some townships, cadres dare not let the masses speak out freely, fearing that things will get out of control and they won't be able to clean up the mess. So, they adopt a "blocking while letting speak" approach. When someone raises a question, the cadre immediately stands up to explain or immediately "launches a debate" to push back the opinion.
	Some townships, although they let the masses speak out, they are impatient during the debate and cannot grasp the main issues. They feel that "speaking out is easy, but debating is difficult." Therefore, some seize a thief or a farmer who violates labor discipline to debate, while others criticize individual households from the beginning. The next day, the individual households request to join the cooperative, and the cadres think that the purpose of the debate has been achieved.
	Some townships neglect ideological mobilization, and their work methods are simple and crude. Some townships even argue fiercely during the debate, and the cadres scold or even beat people.

Comparing these carefully, I feel that the ideological problems of some cadres regarding the current great debate are so uncoordinated with the masses' strong interest in the great debate: the masses are afraid that they won't be able to finish speaking their minds and debating, while some cadres are still afraid of letting speak, afraid of debating, or are frowning and shouting, "Debating is difficult!" What exactly is going on?

So, I asked Duan Yunbao beside me, "Does your township have a work team sent by the higher authorities?"
	"Yes! We are a general cooperative. The work team lives next door to me."
	"Didn't they talk to people like you?"
	"No, you'll understand as soon as I say it." He leaned towards me and lowered his voice, saying, "The work team only listens to them, not to us."

Before this, I only felt that there was one problem that urgently needed to be solved. If this problem was not solved, the rural great debate would be difficult to achieve its intended purpose. This problem is that some rural work cadres lack the necessary understanding and ideological preparation for this serious socialist ideological revolution in the countryside. They are accustomed to using repressive methods to solve the ideological problems of the peasants. However, I have not yet further clarified what the essence of those resistance and fear of difficulties that cadres have toward the great debate is. At this moment, my experiences on the train, especially after listening to Duan Yunbao's remarks, made it clear to me that the essence of this kind of thinking is a right-leaning distrust of the masses. Isn't Duan Yunbao's statement the most sharp illustration of this point? Some of our cadres are shouting that "debating is difficult." In fact, this "difficulty" does not occur among the masses, nor does it occur in the debate itself, but precisely in the cadres' own thinking, because the current ideological revolution is most closely linked to the future of each of the masses and their personal lives. How could this not stir up their intense ideological struggle? In fact, as long as you pay a little attention, you will find that whether it is in the family, in the fields, or under the willow trees and on the train, they are freely debating at any time and anywhere.

Now, I opened my notebook again and reread the plans of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for the current rural rectification movement in the province – on the basis of the victory of the first step, centered on the grain issue, to sum up experience, improve cadres, implement the mass line and the class line. Immediately launch a "people's rectification" movement throughout the province in conjunction with party and commune rectification. At this time, my understanding of its importance became much deeper.

    在列车上听到和想到的
    本报记者　吕建中
    南同蒲线列车从太原一开动，我就拿出从各县向中共山西省委的汇报中摘录的笔记来看。我想冷静思考一下脑子里对山西省当前农村整风运动中的一些我还没有想清楚的问题。
    可是我想不下去，车厢里山西老乡们谈论得太热烈，也太吸引人了，而且我仿佛觉得他们谈论着的和我正在思考着的事情大有关系，于是我全神贯注地听着邻座那几个农民的对话。
      “要说不够吃，那是不掏良心。俺村自从大辩论，我们不吃四百二十斤，情愿吃四百斤。”
      “不是缺粮，就是缺钱。”
      “钱？钱有啥用，走黑市吧，违法，买肉吃吧，不节约，反正由不得你自己。”
    “阎锡山在这时，借一斗麦，还三斗秋，那倒由得你自己！”
    “那社干部呢？他们就该比社员特殊？……咳，我金杓子银碗入了社，以后尽吃尽穿啦，反正是社会主义！”
      “那也不对，社干部自私自利，我们也不能光顾自己，不顾国家。”
    这时候，坐在我对面那个五十岁上下的老农民对这场小辩论也听得满有兴趣，他有时扭回头来对我笑笑，意思是说：你听，这问题到处都存在，不光是我们那一个村呀。
    他是平遥县一个老贫农，名叫段云保。他说他在抗日时期就参加过薄一波同志领导下的决死队，打过日本鬼子，也打过阎锡山。如今有了合作社，他的生活虽不很富裕，总算够吃够用了。今年庄稼受了旱，合作社在管理上也有毛病，减了点产，富裕中农就趁此兴风作浪。段云保好心给社干部提意见，反而受了打击，于是富裕中农又乘机拉拢他。他又气，又苦恼，不知如何是好，便跑到太原铁路局找他儿子寻主意。他儿子鼓励了他，要他回村好好参加大辩论。他说着，挽起袖口，让我看看他胳膊上的伤痕，说：“我心里明白，我过去和阎锡山拼命是为了啥！咱能跟那地主、富裕中农挖社会主义的墙根吗？”
    过一回，我穿过几个车厢到餐车吃饭的时候，我有意识地留心一下，每个车厢里都听得到人们在谈论粮食呀，合作社呀，社会主义呀，等等。
    可是，为什么有些地方的干部就是害怕辩论会，或者发愁群众辩论不起来呢？现在看看我笔记本上的纪录吧：
    有的乡，干部不敢让群众大鸣大放，怕搞乱了没法收拾，于是便采取“边鸣边堵”的办法，有人提出问题干部马上就站出来解释，或者立刻就“发动辩论”，把意见给顶回去。
    有的乡，虽然让群众鸣放出来了，辩论的时候却又不耐心，也抓不住主要问题，觉得“鸣放容易辩论难”。因此有的抓住一个小偷或违犯劳动纪律的农民来辩论，有的一开始就批判单干户，第二天单干户要求入社，干部就认为已经达到了辩论的目的了。
    有的乡，忽视思想发动，工作方法简单、粗暴。还有的乡在辩论中顶了牛，干部就骂人、甚至打人。
    仔细对比一下，我感到有的干部这些对当前大辩论的思想问题，和车厢里的群众对大辩论的浓厚兴趣是多么不协调呀：群众就怕心里的话说不完，辩论不完，而有些干部却还在怕鸣放，怕辩论，或者在愁眉苦脸地喊着“辩论难呀”！这到底是怎么一回事呢？
    于是我又问我身边的段云保：“你乡里有没有上级派去的工作组？”
      “有啊！我们那是个总社哩。工作组就住在我隔壁。”
    “他们没有找你们这些人谈谈吗？”
      “没有，我一说你就明白了。”他向我探过身子来，放低了声音说：“工作组光听他们的，不听我们的。”
    在这以前，我只感到有一个问题急需解决，这个问题不解决，农村大辩论将很难达到预期的目的，这个问题就是还有些农村工作干部对农村这场严重的社会主义思想革命缺乏应有的认识和思想准备。他们习惯于用压服的办法来解决农民的思想问题。然而我还没有进一步想清楚，干部对大辩论所产生的那些抵触、畏难思想，它的实质到底是什么。而此刻，我在列车上的见闻，尤其听了段云保的那一席话，我脑子里清楚了，这种思想的实质就是不相信群众的右倾思想，段云保的话不是最尖锐不过地说明了这一点吗？我们有些干部在喊“辩论难”，事实上这个“难”字并不发生在群众，也不发生在辩论本身，而正是发生在干部自己的思想上，因为当前这场思想革命最紧密不过地连系着每个群众的前途和他们的切身生活，这怎么会不搅动起他们的激烈地思想斗争呢？事实上只要你稍一留心，你就会发现不论在家庭里，田野间，也不论在柳荫下和列车上，他们随时随地都在自由地辩论着。
    现在，我再打开笔记本，重看一下中共山西省委对全省当前农村整风运动的打算——在第一步以粮食问题为中心的大辩论的胜利基础上，总结经验，提高干部，贯彻群众路线和阶级路线。立即在全省范围内结合整党整社，深入开展一个“全民整风”运动。这时候，我对它的重要性的体会就深切得多了。
