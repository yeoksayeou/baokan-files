Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 21st: According to a report from the Syrian News Agency on October 20th, the Moroccan Ambassador and the Sudanese Chargé d'Affaires told the Syrian government that their governments support Syria and are willing to do everything possible to help Syria prevent aggression.

The Greek Chargé d'Affaires in Damascus also told Acting Foreign Minister Kalas on the 20th that his government supports Syria's complaint to the United Nations regarding the gathering of Turkish troops on the Syrian border.

On the same day, President Kuwatly continued to receive many telegrams from abroad, condemning the U.S. and Turkish aggression conspiracies against Syria and expressing support for Syria's anti-aggression struggle. The telegrams came from: Lebanese Socialist Progressive Party leader Jumblatt, Supporters Party (a Lebanese nationalist Muslim youth organization) leader Hakim, the Lebanese National Organization, youth in Gaza, Egypt, Jordanian youth, and Kuwaiti youth.

Some Arabs in Syria's neighboring countries have expressed their willingness to serve as volunteers to defend Syria's independence.

Residents of various cities in Syria have also sent telegrams to President Kuwatly, expressing their support for the government's determination to safeguard independence.

On October 20th, the Syrian government continued to distribute weapons to members of the People's Resistance Organization in Homs and other cities. This organization provides military training to all Syrian people so that they can be prepared to defeat any aggression against Syria by the imperialists.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, October 21st: The Hungarian "People's Freedom" newspaper published a statement by the Hungarian Foreign Ministry on October 20th regarding the situation in the Near and Middle East.

The statement said that the Hungarian people sympathetically watch the resolute struggle of the Arab people, especially the Syrian people, for the freedom and independence of their motherland. We stand with the Syrian people and angrily condemn imperialist aggression.

The statement said that recently, the imperialists, especially the United States, have repeatedly attempted to launch aggression, and they have not drawn the necessary lessons from the failures in Hungary and the Suez Canal a year ago.

The statement emphasized that Hungary expects the United Nations not to take a position that is contrary to facts and truth, as it did when discussing the so-called "Hungarian question."

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, October 21st: TASS reports from Rome on October 20th: The leadership of the Italian Communist Party issued a statement calling on all working people to pay attention to the seriousness of the situation in the Middle East. The statement said: The Turkish government, at the behest of the U.S. State Department, has concentrated troops on the Syrian border in preparation for an attack on that country, and the U.S. Sixth Fleet has sailed to the Syrian coast, which has seriously threatened peace in the Middle East.

The statement went on to point out that the Italian government, instead of immediately taking measures to defend peace, has endorsed and praised the Eisenhower Doctrine, using so-called "Western unity" to cover up imperialist adventures, and attacking the Soviet Union, which actively defends peace in the Middle East and the rights of the Arab peoples to independence.

The statement said: The Italian people, who have built broad solidarity in the great struggle against war, must loudly protest the dangerous policies of the clerical government and defend peace at home and in the world.

The statement concluded: Italy should support Syria's request to the United Nations to come forward to provide protection, and should advocate that the United Nations send a committee that guarantees impartiality to investigate the disturbing situation on the Turkish-Syrian border.

Italy should publicly declare that it condemns any attack on Syria, and recognizes Syria's right to pursue a neutral policy and to be master in its own house. Italy should take measures to bring the major countries to the table to reach an agreement to guarantee peace in the Middle East and to ensure that the independence of the Arab countries is not subject to any foreign interference.

    对叙利亚的声援来自四面八方
    意共号召抗议政府附和美国侵略政策
    新华社大马士革21日电　据叙利亚通讯社10月20日报道，摩洛哥大使和苏丹代办告诉叙利亚政府说，他们的政府支持叙利亚，并且愿意尽一切力量帮助叙利亚来防止侵略。
    希腊驻大马士革代办20日也对代理外交部长卡拉斯说，他的政府支持叙利亚在联合国提出来的对土耳其军队在叙利亚边境集结的控诉。
    同一天，库阿特利总统继续接到从国外打来的许多电报，这些电报谴责美国和土耳其对叙利亚的侵略阴谋，并且表示支持叙利亚反侵略的斗争。打电报来的有：黎巴嫩社会主义进步党领袖琼布拉特，支持者党（黎巴嫩的一个民族主义的穆斯林青年组织）领袖哈基姆，黎巴嫩全国组织，埃及加沙的青年，约旦青年和科威特青年。
    叙利亚邻国的一些阿拉伯人表示愿意充当志愿军来保卫叙利亚的独立。
    叙利亚各城市的居民也纷纷打电报给库阿特利总统，表示拥护政府维护独立的决心。
    叙利亚政府20日继续把武器分配给霍姆斯和其他城市的人民抵抗组织的人员。这个组织对所有叙利亚人民进行军事训练，以便使人民能够做好准备击败帝国主义者对叙利亚进行的任何侵略。
    据新华社布达佩斯21日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”20日发表了匈牙利外交部关于中近东局势的声明。
    声明说，匈牙利人民同情地注视着阿拉伯人民、首先是叙利亚人民为祖国的自由和独立而进行的坚决斗争。我们同叙利亚人民站在一起，愤怒地谴责帝国主义的侵略。
    声明说，最近以来，帝国主义者、首先是美国，一再企图发动侵略，他们并没有从一年前在匈牙利和苏伊士运河的失败中得出必要的教训。
    声明强调指出，匈牙利期待联合国不要采取像在讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”时那种违背事实和真理的立场。
    据新华社21日讯　据塔斯社罗马20日讯：意大利共产党领导机构发表声明，吁请全体劳动人民注意中东局势的严重性。声明说：土耳其政府听命于美国国务院，把军队集结在叙利亚的边境上准备进攻这个国家以及美国第六舰队开到叙利亚海岸，这已经严重地威胁了中东的和平。
    声明接着指出，意大利政府不但没有立即采取措施来捍卫和平，反而赞同和颂扬艾森豪威尔主义，以所谓“西方团结”来掩饰帝国主义的冒险行为，并且攻击积极捍卫中东和平和阿拉伯各国人民独立权利的苏联。
    声明说：曾经在伟大的斗争中建立起广泛团结来反对战争的意大利人民必须大声疾呼抗议教权政府的危险政策，保卫本国和世界和平。
    声明最后说：意大利应当支持叙利亚已经提出的要求联合国出面保护的要求，并且应当主张联合国派一个保证不偏袒任何一方的委员会去调查土叙边境令人不安的局势。
    意大利应当公开声明，它谴责对叙利亚的任何进攻，并且承认叙利亚有权实行中立政策，有权作自己家里的主人。意大利应当采取措施，促使各主要国家坐到一张桌子上来达成协议，以保障中东和平，使阿拉伯国家的独立不致受到任何外国干涉。
