    Here Friendship Is Everywhere
    Chinese Student in the Soviet Union, Liu Hongming
    While studying in Moscow, I feel the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people everywhere. When we Chinese walk on the streets, we often hear a "Hello" from behind. We also often encounter groups of children playing football on the street. When they bump into passers-by while fighting for the ball, they are about to say "Sorry" but when they look up and see that it is a Chinese person, they very fluently say "Ni—Hao"!
    One day, on the way back to the dormitory after class, I stopped by the store to buy some bread and sausage. While waiting outside the counter to pick up my things, I heard two female salesclerks excitedly discussing the problem of learning Chinese, so they didn't see me, the customer. I only heard the older one saying to a younger girl very seriously and with some difficulty that Chinese is really difficult to learn, "Ni—Hao", right? The young girl nodded with a smile. At this moment, her eyes happened to fall on me standing outside the counter, and she apologetically asked what kind of bread I wanted, but she immediately realized that the person standing in front of them was a Chinese student, and she quickly turned to the older salesclerk and suggested, ask him, he is Chinese! I immediately chimed in: you are right! Obviously they were very happy, picked the softest bread from the pile of bread, wrapped it in paper and handed it to me warmly. When I said goodbye, they immediately asked again: How do you say goodbye in Chinese?
    Once after dinner, a Chinese classmate and I took the subway to the city center. When the train was about to arrive at our destination station - Komsomolskaya station - we suddenly heard a not very fluent but very clearly articulated Chinese sentence: "You—are—Chinese—friends—?"
    We looked up suddenly and saw a Soviet officer standing in front of our seats. He looked a little embarrassed as he waited for our answer.
    "Yes, we are your Chinese friends!" After we said that, he seemed less nervous and immediately stretched out his hand and shook my hand tightly.
    It turned out that he had noticed us when we got on the train, but he hesitated for three stops because he thought his Chinese was not very good before finally blurting out this sentence. His voice was loud, causing the passengers in the carriage to turn their heads curiously to look at us. Because he knew that we understood what he was saying, he ignored the attention of others and earnestly and laboriously talked to us in Chinese word by word.
    "I—am—Soviet officer—Captain—Infantry".
    "You speak very well! Where did you learn Chinese?" I asked.
    "I—speak—not good—you—understand?" Then he said in Russian: It is very difficult to learn by oneself. I heard that Moscow University has a Department of Oriental Languages where you can learn Chinese, but I can't, because I don't have time to study because of my military duties! I asked him if he had been to China, and he said: "I love China very much. I have not been to China, but how much I want to see China!" From his sincere pronunciation and complete sentences, it can be seen that he had spent a lot of effort and worked hard to study the Chinese language.
    The passengers in the carriage were attracted by this officer who could speak fluent Chinese. Many people moved closer, and many eyes moved between us. Although they couldn't understand what we were saying, they realized from our free and interesting mood that this was a friendly conversation between Chinese and Soviet friends.
    We were deeply moved by the sincerity and honesty of this Soviet officer. In his language and eyes, there was a deep brotherly affection for China.
    At this time, the train had arrived at Komsomolskaya station, and he happened to be getting off too. We walked out of the carriage together, and as we climbed the escalator, our conversation continued as we ascended.
    "China—great—China—Comrade Mao Zedong!"
    The escalator took us to the top floor, and the sincere feelings of the Soviet comrade reached their peak.
    This kind of thing is common in Moscow, it's a small matter, but it leaves such a strong memory! (Attached picture)

    这里处处是友情
    中国留苏学生　刘鸿铭
    我在莫斯科学习，处处感到中苏人民深厚的友谊。当我们中国人走在街头时，经常会从你背后传来一句“你好”的声音。也常常碰到一群在街上踢足球的孩子们。他们为了抢一个球而撞上了过路人，刚要说声对不起时猛抬头看到是中国人，就很流利地向你来句“你—好”！
    有一天，在下课回宿舍的途中，我顺便到商店买些面包香肠。在柜台外等着取东西的时候，听到两位女售货员在兴高采烈地谈论着学中文的问题，因而都没看见我这位顾客。只听到其中年纪较大的向一位年轻的姑娘很认真而又有点为难地说，中国话真难学，“你—好”，对吗？年轻的姑娘笑眯眯地点点头。在这当儿，她的眼光恰好落在站在柜台外面的我的身上，就抱歉地问我要什么样面包，但立刻她又发现站在她们面前的是个中国学生，她很快地转头向年纪大些的售货员提议，你问问他，他是中国人！我立刻接上说：你说的很对！显然她们很高兴，在大堆的面包中拣最软的用纸包好热情地递给了我。当我说再见时，她们随即又问：中国话再见怎么说？
    一次晚饭后，我和一位中国同学乘地下电车到市中心去。当车快行到我们的到达站——共青团车站时，突然听到一句不太流利而咬字非常清楚的中国话：“你—们—是中国—朋友吗？”
    我们猛然抬头，看到一位苏联军官站在我们的座位面前。他有些难为情的样子等着我们回答。
    “对，我们是你的中国朋友！”我们说了之后，他好像不那么紧张了，马上伸出手来，紧紧地握住了我的手。
    原来当我们上车时他就注意到了，但是考虑自己的中国话说得不灵，一直犹豫了三站路这句话才冲出口来。他的声音很大，使得车厢里的乘客都好奇地扭过头来看我们。他因为说的话我们懂了，所以也不顾别人的注意，就认真地、困难地一字一字地用中文同我们谈了起来。
      “我—是—苏联军官—上尉—步兵”。
      “你说的很好！你在那里学的中国话？”我问道。
      “我—说的—不好听—你们—明白吗？”然后又用俄文说：自己学很困难哪，听说莫斯科大学有东方语文系可以学习中国话，但是我不能，因为军队的职务没有时间去学！我问他到过中国没有，他说：“我很爱中国，我没有去过中国，可是我多么想看看中国啊！”从他的吐字真切，语句完整可以看出他是熬费了很大心血，下了很多功夫钻研中国语言的。
    车厢里的乘客们都被这位能操着满口中国话的军官吸引住了，很多人移近来，很多只眼睛转动在我们之间。虽然他们听不懂我们在说些什么，但从我们谈得很自如有趣的情绪中体会到了这是中苏两国朋友之间的友谊谈话。
    我们深深被这位苏联军官的挚诚、敦厚所感动。在他的语言里，眼睛里，闪烁着对中国深厚的兄弟之情。
    这时车已到共青团车站，正好他也下车。我们一同步出车厢，在登上地下电梯时，顺着电梯往上升起，我们的谈话一直没有间断。
    “中—国—伟大—的中—国—毛泽东同志！”
    电梯把我们带到了最上层，苏联同志的挚诚心意达到了最高峰。
    这种事情在莫斯科常见，是小事情，但，它却给人留下多么强烈的记忆啊！（附图片）
