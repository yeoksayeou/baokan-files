Soviet Trade Unions are a Model for Our Country's Trade Unions
Lai Ruoyu

This year marks the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and the 50th anniversary of Soviet trade unions. In commemorating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, as a trade union worker, I naturally first think of the role of Soviet trade unions in the Soviet revolutionary struggle and construction.

Soviet trade unions are different from trade unions in other Western European countries. They arose and grew strong in revolutionary struggles and were, from the beginning, under the leadership of the Social Democratic Labor Party—the Soviet Communist Party. These characteristics are shared with Chinese trade unions. Many experiences of the Soviet trade unions are worth learning from, and in fact, we have already learned many valuable experiences from them.

In the workers' movements of various countries, there are different paths. Not every country's workers' movement is linked to the socialist movement. On the contrary, in many countries, the workers' movements (or rather, many trade unions) do not touch the capitalist system. For example, British trade unions existed long before 1824 (British trade unions began to exist legally in 1824), that is to say, before the emergence of Marxism, before the emergence of Marxist parties, British trade unions already existed. Therefore, it preserves many of the original spontaneous elements of the trade union movement. This original spontaneous element only guides the working class to fight for some daily economic benefits within the scope allowed by capitalism, without touching the fundamental system of capitalism. Of course, this situation is changing, but the traditional forces are very stubborn. In other European countries, although not as typical as in Britain, the influence of social democratic parties is also very deep in the trade union movement. But Soviet trade unions are different; they are closely linked to the socialist movement.

Soviet trade unions were born during the 1905-1907 Great Revolution. From the very beginning, under the leadership of the Marxist party, they waged resolute struggles against the Tsarist autocracy and the bourgeoisie.

The combination of the Soviet trade union movement and socialism, and the leadership of the Bolshevik Party over the trade unions, was not natural, but was the result of serious struggles. Before about the 1890s, the Russian workers' movement was still very spontaneous. After Lenin founded the "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class" in St. Petersburg in 1895, socialism was combined with the workers' movement in Russia for the first time. After this, Lenin also waged many struggles against the Economists and other reactionary trade union leaders of the time. In 1902, Lenin wrote the famous book "What Is to Be Done?", opposing the Economists of the time. Lenin exposed the views of the Economists, pointing out that they wanted to drag the working class out of the struggle to overthrow the Tsarist system and limit the working class's struggle to daily economic struggles. This would keep the working class in a state of servitude forever. Lenin pointed out that the spontaneous workers' movement, that is, the trade unionist movement, that is, the purely trade union movement, and trade unionism precisely shows that the workers are bound by bourgeois ideology. Lenin pointed out: The task of the Social Democratic Labor Party is to oppose spontaneity, to draw the workers' movement away from this spontaneous tendency of trade unionism, which is to cast itself into the arms of the bourgeoisie, and to attract it to the arms of the revolutionary Social Democratic Labor Party. The Russian workers' movement and trade unions developed and grew strong on the basis of crushing the influence of the Economists.

In the storm of the October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet working class displayed unparalleled heroism, which was inseparable from the arduous work carried out by the Bolsheviks among the workers after the first Great Revolution. Under the leadership of the Leninist party, the Soviet working class and the Soviet trade unions had already become a highly conscious and powerful force before the October Revolution. It was by relying on this powerful force, relying on its alliance with the peasants, that the Tsarist autocracy was overthrown, all efforts by the bourgeoisie to steal the fruits of the revolution were crushed, the armed intervention of imperialism was resisted, the victory of the civil war was won, and unimaginable hardships were overcome.

After the victory of the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Party continued to wage many struggles against opportunists, Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries, and anarcho-syndicalists in the workers' movement. Through these struggles, the leadership of the Bolshevik Party over the trade unions was guaranteed, making the trade unions truly become educators of millions of people, builders of the new society, and schools of communism.

As mentioned earlier, Chinese trade unions also grew and strengthened in revolutionary struggles and were under the leadership of the Communist Party from the beginning. Of course, this does not mean that there have been no struggles against opportunists in the trade union movement. Like the path taken by the Soviet Union, we have also grown and strengthened in the struggle against various opportunist tendencies. Such struggles will continue in the future.

We are a country with a very large number of small producers. At present, the working class is still relatively small. With the development of socialist industry, this force is bound to expand rapidly, and our reserve force is mainly small producers. These small producers will inevitably bring non-proletarian ideology into the working class. This becomes the social basis for opportunist tendencies in the trade union movement. Therefore, one of the important tasks of the trade union is to constantly educate the working class, especially new workers, with communist ideology, and gradually change their thinking so that they become members of the proletariat in the true sense of the word, not only in economic life and production activities, but also in ideology. Trade union organizations and trade union workers should not only reflect the emotions, demands, and opinions of the masses, but more importantly, based on the emotions, demands, and opinions of the masses, find appropriate methods to educate and improve the masses. That is to say, we cannot follow the spontaneous trends of the masses, but must stand in front of the masses and lead them. Precisely for this reason, the trade union must be under the leadership of the Party, and the Party's leadership over the trade union must be strengthened.

The forty years of the Soviet Union's history eloquently prove that the socialist system has incomparable superiority over the capitalist system. Before the October Socialist Revolution, Russia was an economically backward country. In the forty years since, although it has experienced imperialist armed intervention, domestic counter-revolutionary riots, and especially the unprecedentedly brutal struggle against the Hitler bandit gang, it has not been strangled, but has rapidly become the most powerful country in the world. Its science and technology have already leaped to the forefront of the world.

The Soviet October Socialist Revolution opened a new era for mankind. The forty years of Soviet history and the experiences of our country and other fraternal countries all show that socialism and communism are bound to win. The Soviet road is the road of the working class of the whole world, and also the road of all mankind.

Forty years of history is a history of creating miracles. Miracles are created by the working class. The Soviet working class is a force with a high level of culture, technology, and political consciousness. The Soviet trade union—the school of communism—has played and is playing an important role in the training and education of the working class.

The great Soviet Union is a model for us to learn from, and the Soviet trade union is a model for our country's trade union to learn from.

    苏联工会是我国工会的榜样
    赖若愚
    今年是十月社会主义革命四十周年，也是苏联工会五十周年。在纪念十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，作为一个工会工作者，自然首先想到苏联工会在苏联革命斗争和建设事业中的作用。
    苏联工会和西欧其他国家的工会不同，它是在革命斗争中产生和壮大起来的，并且一开始就是在社会民主工党——苏联共产党领导之下的。这些特点和中国工会是共同的。苏联工会的许多经验，都值得我们很好地学习，实际上我们已经学习了苏联工会的许多宝贵经验。
    在世界各国的工人运动中，是存在着不同的道路的，并不是每个国家的工人运动，都和社会主义运动联结在一起。相反的，有许多国家的工人运动（或者说许多工会）是不触动资本主义制度的。例如英国工会在1824年以前很久就产生了（1824年英国工会开始合法存在），就是说，在马克思主义产生以前，在马克思主义的政党产生以前，英国工会就已经产生了。所以它保存了许多工会运动原始的自发成分。这种原始的自发成分，只是引导工人阶级在资本主义所允许的范围之内，争取一些日常的经济利益，而并不触动资本主义的根本制度。当然，这种情况在改变着，但是传统力量是非常顽强的。在欧洲其他国家，虽然不像英国这样典型，但是社会民主党的影响，在工会运动中也是很深的。可是苏联工会却是另外一个样子，它是和社会主义运动紧紧地结合在一起的。
    苏联工会是在1905年到1907年大革命当中产生的。它一开始诞生就在马克思主义政党的领导下与沙皇专制制度、资产阶级进行了坚决的斗争。
    苏联工会运动和社会主义的结合，布尔什维克党对工会的领导，并不是自然而然的，而是经过严重的斗争的。大约在十九世纪九十年代以前，俄国的工人运动还带有很大的自发性。1895年列宁在彼得堡创立了“工人阶级解放斗争协会”以后，才第一次在俄国把社会主义与工人运动结合起来。在这以后，列宁也还和当时的经济派及其他反动的工会领袖进行了许多斗争。1902年列宁写了有名的“做什么”一书，反对当时的经济派，列宁揭露了经济派的观点，指出它是想把工人阶级从推翻沙皇制度的斗争中拖出来，把工人阶级的斗争局限于日常的经济斗争。这会使工人阶级永远处于被奴役的地位。列宁指出，自发的工人运动，也就是工联主义的运动，也就是纯粹的职工会运动，而工联主义正是表明工人受资产阶级思想的束缚。列宁指出：社会民主工党的任务，是要反对自发性，是要工人运动脱离这种投到资产阶级羽翼下面的工联主义自发趋向，而把它吸引到革命的社会民主工党的羽翼下来。俄国工人运动和工会，就是在粉碎了经济派影响的基础上发展和壮大起来的。
    在十月社会主义革命的风暴中，苏联工人阶级表现了无比的英勇气概，这是和布尔什维克在第一次大革命以后，在工人中所进行的艰苦工作分不开的。苏联工人阶级和苏联工会，在列宁党的领导下，在十月革命以前已经成为一支有高度觉悟的强大的队伍了。就是依靠这一支强大的队伍，依靠它和农民的联合，推翻了沙皇专制制度，粉碎了资产阶级窃取革命果实的一切努力，抵抗了帝国主义的武装干涉，赢得了国内战争的胜利，也克服了难以想像的艰难困苦。
    十月革命胜利以后，布尔什维克党在工人运动中同机会主义分子、孟什维克分子、社会革命党人和无政府工团主义者继续进行过许多斗争。通过这些斗争，保障了布尔什维克党对工会的领导，使工会真正成为千百万人的教育者，成为新社会的建设者，成为共产主义的学校。
    前面已经说过，中国工会也是在革命斗争中生长和壮大起来的，也是一开始就在共产党领导之下的。当然，这并不等于在工会运动中，没有和机会主义者进行过什么斗争。和苏联走过的道路一样，我们也是在同各种机会主义倾向的斗争中生长和壮大起来的。这种斗争今后也还会有。
    我们是小生产者极其众多的国家，现在工人阶级队伍还比较小，随着社会主义工业的发展，这支队伍势必要迅速地扩大，而我们的后备队，主要就是小生产者。这些小生产者必不可免地要把非无产阶级的思想意识带到工人阶级队伍中来。这就成为工会运动中的机会主义倾向的社会基础。所以工会的重要任务之一，就是以共产主义思想不断地教育工人阶级，特别是新工人，逐步地改变他们的思想，使他们不只在经济生活和生产活动上，而且在思想意识上成为名副其实的无产阶级的成员。工会组织和工会工作者不仅要反映群众的情绪、要求和意见，更重要的是根据群众的情绪、要求和意见，找寻适当的方法来教育群众、提高群众。这就是说，我们不能跟着群众的自发趋势跑，而要站在群众的前边领导群众。正因为如此，工会必须在党的领导之下，必须加强党对工会的领导。
    苏联四十年的历史，雄辩地证明社会主义制度比资本主义制度有无可比拟的优越性。十月社会主义革命以前的俄国，是一个经济比较落后的国家。四十年以来，虽然经历了帝国主义的武装干涉、国内的反革命暴乱，特别是经历了和希特勒匪帮的史无前例的残酷搏斗，可是它没有被扼杀，而是迅速地成为世界上最富强的国家。它的科学技术已经跃居世界首位。
    苏联十月社会主义革命给人类开辟了一个新的纪元，苏联四十年的历史和我国以及其他兄弟国家的经历，都说明了社会主义、共产主义是必然要胜利的。苏联的道路，就是全世界工人阶级的道路，也是全人类的道路。
    四十年的历史，是创造奇迹的历史。奇迹是工人阶级创造的。苏联工人阶级是一支具有高度文化、技术水平和高度政治觉悟的队伍。苏联工会——共产主义的学校，对于工人阶级的培养教育，是起了并且起着重要作用的。
    伟大的苏联，是我们学习的榜样，苏联工会，是我国工会学习的榜样。
