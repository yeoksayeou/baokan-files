    A Glimpse of Wutaishan Stadium
    Climbing Nanjing's Wutaishan Mountain, a basin surrounded by mountains first catches the eye, this is the large track and field of Wutaishan Stadium. Surrounding the track and field is a standard 400-meter running track, with a green lawn football field in the center. The field has a full set of track and field equipment, including a water pool for the 3,000-meter steeplechase. The cement bleachers on the hillside can accommodate 50,000 spectators. The National Track and Field Championships were held here.
    Wutaishan Stadium was built using the natural mountain terrain, covering a total area of over 100,000 square meters. In addition to the large track and field, there is also a large stadium that can accommodate 15,000 spectators and a swimming pool for 1,000 spectators. In addition, there is also a exercise equipment ground.
    As early as twenty years ago, Chinese sports figures Xu Biao, Wu Yunrui, and others had already taken a liking to Wutaishan, wanting to turn this suitably located place into a sports activity venue, but under reactionary rule, their ideals were just dreams.
    After liberation, the old sports figure Xu Biao's twenty-year-old ideal came true. His proposal was immediately passed by the Nanjing Municipal People's Committee and approved by the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee, and this large-scale stadium was quickly built. In order to green the stadium, thousands of workers, cadres, and students planted trees, dug soil, and performed voluntary labor here, and now it is shaded by green trees, a green expanse, and has become a good place for the broad masses of people to exercise.

    五台山体育场一瞥
    登上南京五台山，一块被山峦环抱的盆地首先映入人们的眼帘，这就是五台山体育场的大型田径场。田径场的四周环绕着标准的四百公尺跑道，中间是一片绿草如茵的足球场。场内有全套的田径运动设备，包括三千公尺障碍赛跑用的水池等。依山坡的水泥石看台，可以容纳五万名观众。全国田径运动会，就是在这里举行的。
    五台山体育场是利用天然山势建筑成的，总共占地十万多平方公尺。除了大型田径场，还有可容纳一万五千观众的大型球场和一千观众的游泳池。此外，还有一个器械操场。
    早在二十多年前，我国体育家徐镳、吴蕴瑞等就已经看中了五台山，想将这个环境适中的地方变为一个体育活动场所，但是在反动统治之下，他们的理想，只是梦想罢了。
    解放后，老体育家徐镳二十多年的理想实现了。他的提案立刻得到了南京市人民委员会的通过，得到了江苏省人民委员会的批准，很快地修建了这座规模庞大的体育场。为了绿化体育场，成千上万的工人、干部、学生在这里植树、挖土、进行义务劳动，现在它已是绿树成荫，青青一片，成为广大人民锻炼身体的好场所。
