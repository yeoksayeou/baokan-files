    New Research on Preventing Schistosomiasis
    Tea seed cake, the residue from pressing oil from tea seeds, is non-toxic to humans, livestock, and crops, but it can kill the cercariae of schistosomiasis and inhibit the intermediate host of schistosomiasis, Oncomelania hupensis, from releasing cercariae. This is the conclusion confirmed by Shanghai First Medical College after conducting various scientific experiments in the laboratory based on folk remedies.
    Veterinary workers in Shanghai have found a new method for diagnosing schistosomiasis in draught cattle - scraping the rectal mucosa for schistosomiasis eggs. The accuracy of this method is nearly 50% higher than the currently most reliable fecal examination method, and it is convenient and simple.
    In applying the new method, veterinary workers have also successfully trial-produced a more effective scraping tool.

    防止血吸虫病的新研究
    茶树籽榨油所得渣滓——茶子饼对人、家畜和农作物无毒，可是能够杀死血吸虫的尾幼，而且能够抑制血吸虫的中间宿主钉螺施放尾幼的作用。这是上海第一医学院根据民间验方在实验室作多种科学实验以后，得到证实的结论。
    上海兽医工作者找到了一种诊断耕牛血吸虫病的新方法——在直肠的粘膜上搔扒血吸虫卵。这种方法的准确性比目前应用最可靠的粪便检查法，还高近50％，而且方便、简单。
    兽医工作者们在应用新方法中，还试制成功一种效力较好的搔扒工具。
