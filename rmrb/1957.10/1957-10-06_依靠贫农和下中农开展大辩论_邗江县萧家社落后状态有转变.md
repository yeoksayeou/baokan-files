Relying on Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants to Launch a Great Debate
The Backward State of Xiaojia Cooperative in Hanjiang County Has Changed

    (Reported by our newspaper) The Xiaojia Cooperative in Tangwang Township, Hanjiang County, Jiangsu Province, has begun to change its backward state and establish a righteous atmosphere through the socialist great debate. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the cooperative have strengthened their confidence in running the cooperative, the well-to-do middle peasants have changed their wavering emotions, and the original nineteen households who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative no longer want to withdraw. During the movement, seven poor peasant activists were also promoted to serve as cadres of the cooperative, and the organizational structure of the cooperative was adjusted. The attendance rate has also increased from 30% in the past to more than 90%.

    The Xiaojia Cooperative was formed this spring by merging two elementary cooperatives, with a total of one hundred and twenty-five households. This cooperative is a Class III cooperative with impure leadership components. Among the leading cadres of the cooperative, middle peasant and rich peasant components account for 60%. The cooperative director is a well-to-do middle peasant, and the chief accountant is a rich peasant. They are not united with each other. Many cooperative members have a vague understanding of collectivization and the unified purchase and sale of grain. Middle peasants openly complained that the cooperative and the unified purchase and sale were not good. Landlords, rich peasants, and remaining counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to stir up trouble and incite cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperative. Rich peasant Zhong Yuchang took the fertilizer from the cooperative's pond home and also took the wood and grass used by the team to build sheds to burn for cooking, and prevented the cooperative members from watering his land. Therefore, the cooperative members' enthusiasm for production was not high. More than eight hundred mu of wheat only yielded one hundred and ten jin per mu, and the task of requisitioning and purchasing public grain was not completed.

    In this socialist great debate, the township organized a work team to go to the cooperative, first cultivated and trained poor peasant backbones, and then mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants. At a meeting of eighty-two poor and lower-middle peasant households, they used living examples to promote the benefits of collectivization and the unified purchase and sale of grain, and inspired everyone to recall and compare, thereby enhancing their awareness. Poor peasant Xiao Taiyin said that when he worked on his own, the rice he harvested was not enough to pay for the waterwheel, but his income increased several times after collectivization. He said that he had "eaten the fruit and forgotten the tree." Poor peasant Xiao Changyin and others from the first team also took the initiative to examine their mistakes in privately distributing two thousand four hundred jin of grain in the summer at the meeting.

    On the basis of raising the awareness of poor and middle peasants, small forums were held with production teams as units to conduct a great airing of views and debates. Yang Zhengrong, a well-to-do middle peasant from the third team, said: "After the unified purchase and sale, there is less grain to eat. According to the three-fixed standard, it is not enough to eat even if strung on a needle." Poor peasant Xiao Taikuan retorted: "My family has seven people, we eat better when we are busy, and we eat less when we are idle. It is completely enough to eat grain according to the plan. Why isn't it enough for you?" Poor peasant Xiao Jinfa also chimed in and said: "Yang Zhengrong's family is building a house and providing meals for the craftsmen, in order to save some wages for himself, but he has eaten up the grain. How can he blame the three-fixed standard for being low?" During the debate, some people also exposed the destructive words and deeds of unlawful rich peasants and bad elements, and used the method of reasoning struggle to overthrow the bad element Xiao Tailiang.

    After the debate, the evil atmosphere in the cooperative was suppressed, and the righteous atmosphere began to rise. All one hundred and twenty-five households in the cooperative signed the "Three Loves" pact: guarantee the completion of the grain purchase task, repay overdue loans; actively participate in production labor, ensure the quality of agricultural work, and cherish public property; be careful in planning and save grain.

    依靠贫农和下中农开展大辩论
    邗江县萧家社落后状态有转变
    本报讯　江苏省邗江县汤汪乡萧家社通过社会主义大辩论，开始改变了落后状态，树立了正气。社内贫农和下中农坚定了办社信心，富裕中农转变了动摇情绪，原来十九户要求退社的，也不退社了。运动中还提拔了七个贫农积极分子担任社的干部，调整了社的组织机构。出勤率也由过去的30％提高到90％以上。
    萧家社是今年春天由两个初级社合并起来的，社员共一百二十五户。这个社是领导成分不纯的三类社，社的领导干部中，中农和富农成分的占60％，正社长是富裕中农，总会计是富农，他们互相间不团结。许多社员对合作化和粮食统购统销认识模糊，中农公开埋怨合作社、统购统销不好，地主富农和残余反革命分子从中挑拨是非，煽动社员退社。富农仲与昌把农业社塘里的肥料挑回家，把队里盖草棚的木草也挑回烧锅，并阻止社员在他的土地上放水。因此，社员生产情绪不高，八百多亩麦子，每亩只收一百一十斤，公粮征购任务也未完成。
    在这次社会主义大辩论中，乡里组织了工作组到社，先培养和训练了贫农骨干，然后把贫农和下中农发动起来，在八十二户贫农和下中农的会上，用活人活事宣传了合作化和统购统销的好处，并启发大家回忆对比，提高了他们的觉悟。贫农萧太银，单干时打的稻子不够付车水钱，合作化后收入增加了几倍，他说自己是“吃了果子忘了树”。一队贫农萧长银等还在会上主动检讨了夏季参加私分二千四百斤粮食的错误。
    在贫农、中农提高觉悟的基础上，又以生产队为单位开小型座谈会，大鸣大放开展了辩论。三队富裕中农杨正荣说：“统购统销以后，粮少吃了，按三定标准，串在针上都不够吃。”贫农萧太宽反驳他说：“我家七口，忙时吃好点，闲时吃差点，按计划吃粮完全够用，为什么你不够吃？”贫农萧金发也插上来说：“杨正荣家里砌房子，管匠人的饭，为的是想自己省些工资，却把粮食吃空了，怎么怪三定标准低呢？”辩论中，有人还揭露了不法富农和坏分子的破坏言行，并用说理斗争的方法，斗倒了坏分子萧太亮。
    经过辩论，这个社原来的那股邪气被压下去了，正气开始上升。全社一百二十五户都订了“三爱”公约：保证完成粮食征购任务，偿还到期贷款；积极参加生产劳动，保证农活质量，爱护公共财物；精打细算，节约粮食。　　（薛金鳌）
