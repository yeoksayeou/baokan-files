Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 29th: Sichuan Province, which has achieved its eighth consecutive year of bumper harvests, is seeing agricultural cooperatives in various areas actively store grain in preparation for lean years and famine. This grain is allocated from surplus grain after fulfilling state procurement quotas and retaining sufficient rations, seeds, and fodder. The famine reserve grain is divided into two categories: collectively owned by the cooperative and self-prepared by the members. Generally, the collective reserve grain stored by agricultural cooperatives averages about three to five jin per person; the amount of grain stored by members individually varies.

The measure of storing grain for famine relief has been widely supported by farmers. In the past, counties in Dazhou, Suining and other regions had mutual assistance organizations such as "righteous granaries" to store grain for famine relief. However, due to the bankruptcy of the rural areas caused by the Kuomintang reactionary government, the scarcity of grain, and the fact that landlords and local bullies often used these organizations for fraud and exploitation, the effect was minimal. Now the situation has fundamentally changed, and farmers are highly enthusiastic about storing grain. Farmers in the Leshan region have put forward the slogan "every household saves, every cooperative stores grain." Many agricultural cooperatives have overfulfilled their grain storage plans.

Storing grain for famine relief does not affect the state's procurement tasks and the rations of cooperative members. Many agricultural cooperative members retain more rations than last year. Jiulong Township Longjing Agricultural Cooperative in Linshui County has, in addition to fulfilling the state procurement tasks and retaining sufficient rations, seeds, and fodder, a surplus of more than 240,000 jin of grain this year, storing more than 99,000 jin and still having 150,000 jin remaining. Gouzhuang and thirteen other agricultural cooperatives in Nongsheng Township, Yibin County, stored a total of more than 390,000 jin of grain.

Many agricultural cooperatives have organized "famine reserve grain management teams" responsible for the receipt, expenditure, storage, and inspection of famine reserve grain, and have decided to replace it with new grain every year for storage, and not to spend it casually unless there is a major disaster. Expenditures must be approved by the cooperative management committee or the members' representative assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 29th: The Shengli, Jian'er, and Liu-yi agricultural cooperatives in Lingqiao Township, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, have decided to store a total of 78,000 jin of reserve grain and contingency grain this year. At present, the agricultural cooperatives are actively building and repairing grain storage warehouses and formulating regulations for the storage, management, and use of stored grain.

After undergoing socialist education, the members of these three agricultural cooperatives understood the significance of "using surplus to compensate for shortage and storing grain to prepare for famine." Starting this year, in years of good harvests, in addition to fulfilling the state grain procurement tasks, they will also reserve a certain amount of grain each year to meet urgent needs within the cooperative. Initially, some cooperative members were concerned that storing grain would reduce the level of rations, and a few cadres were also afraid of the trouble of storing grain. Therefore, the agricultural cooperatives conducted education through meetings for Communist Party members, cadres, and members, and at the same time used detailed accounting methods to explain that storing grain in good harvest years would not affect the grain consumption level of the members. For example, Jian'er Cooperative averaged 526 jin of rations per member last year. This year, the agricultural cooperative's grain production increased. In addition to completing the procurement task and leaving seeds and fodder, storing 30,000 jin of reserve grain and contingency grain, the average ration per person still reached 542 jin, an increase of 12.5 jin compared to last year. After factual education, cooperative cadres and members agreed to store grain, and some members said: The country has large warehouses, and the cooperative has small warehouses. When both large and small warehouses are full of grain, we will not be afraid of unexpected disasters.

### 四川省农业社普遍储粮备荒  浙江富阳县三个社储粮七万八千斤

    四川省农业社普遍储粮备荒
    浙江富阳县三个社储粮七万八千斤
    新华社成都29日电　连续获得第八年丰收的四川省，各地农业社纷纷储存粮食，以备歉收年和荒年的需要。这批粮食是在完成国家征购任务并留足了口粮、种籽和饲料以后，从余粮中拨出的。备荒粮分合作社公有和社员自备两类，一般农业社集体储备的粮食数量平均每个人约有三到五斤；社员们各自储备的粮食数量不等。
    储存备荒粮的措施得到农民普遍拥护。达县、遂宁等专区的农村过去曾有过“义仓”等互济互助组织，储粮备荒。但是由于国民党反动政府弄得农村破产，粮食稀少，加之地主恶霸又常常利用这些组织进行诈骗剥削，效果很小。现在情况已经根本改变，农民储粮热情很高。乐山专区农民提出了“户户节约、社社储粮”的口号。很多农业社的储粮计划都超额完成了。
    储存备荒粮后，并不影响国家的征购任务和社员的口粮，很多农业社社员们留的口粮都比去年多。邻水县九龙乡龙井农业社今年除完成国家征购任务，留足口粮、种籽和饲料之外，还剩下粮食二十四万多斤，储存了九万九千多斤，还余下十五万斤。宜宾县农胜乡构庄等十三个农业社共储存粮食三十九万多斤。
    有许多农业社组织了“备荒粮保管小组”，担负备荒粮的收支、保管和检查等责任，并决定每年掉换成新粮储存，非遇特大灾害不得随意开支。开支时须经社务管理委员会或社员代表大会批准。
    新华社杭州29日电　浙江省富阳县灵桥乡的胜利、建二和六一等农业社，决定今年共存储备粮和机动粮七万八千斤。现在，农业社正积极筹建和修理储粮仓库，并订出保管和使用存粮的条例。
    这三个农业社的社员，经过社会主义教育后，明白了“以丰补歉、积谷备荒”的意义，从今年开始，在丰收年景中除了完成国家粮食征购的任务，每年还储备一定数量的粮食，以备社内急需。起初，有部分社员还顾虑储备粮食会降低口粮水平，少数干部对储粮也有怕麻烦的思想。因此，农业社都通过会议向共产党员、干部和社员进行教育，同时用算细账的办法说明丰收年景储粮不会影响社员的用粮水平。如建二社去年每个社员平均分得口粮五百二十六斤，今年农业社粮食增产，除了完成了征购任务和留下种籽、饲料以外，再存三万斤储备粮和机动粮，平均每人的口粮还达到五百四十二斤，比去年增加了十二斤半。经过事实教育后，社干部和社员们都同意储备粮食，有些社员说：国家有大仓库，合作社有小仓库，大小仓库储满粮，就不怕意外的灾荒了。
