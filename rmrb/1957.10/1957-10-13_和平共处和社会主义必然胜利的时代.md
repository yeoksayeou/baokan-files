　　The interview given by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, to "New York Times" reporter Reston on October 7th, thoroughly and clearly analyzed the current international situation, and once again clarified the Soviet Union's policy of peaceful coexistence. Khrushchev's remarks will undoubtedly be welcomed and valued by peace-loving people around the world.
    Khrushchev pointed out in the interview that due to the emergence of modern supersonic aircraft, the development of intercontinental rockets, and other scientific and technological achievements, countries should, more than ever before, learn to live together like good neighbors in a more sensible manner. This is precisely the issue that people of all countries are most concerned about at present. The necessity of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is becoming increasingly obvious. Given the rapid development of science and technology, if countries cannot learn to coexist peacefully, it will inevitably lead to major disasters. Therefore, achieving peaceful coexistence has become the common call of mankind. This is also the goal pursued by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in the world.
    The Soviet Union has a strong force and highly developed level in science and technology, and in this regard, it has surpassed the most advanced capitalist country—the United States. The Soviet Union possesses weapons that the United States does not yet have, namely intercontinental ballistic rockets, which has been fully proven by the groundbreaking feat of the Soviet Union's successful launch of artificial earth satellites. However, despite this, the Soviet Union still firmly advocates peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Khrushchev stated that the Soviet Union is willing to reach an agreement on the entire issue of disarmament right now, even to the extent that countries only retain civil police and no armies. In this case, as Khrushchev pointed out, it would ensure that tools like intercontinental ballistic rockets would only serve peaceful purposes.
    Socialist countries do not need war and are doing everything in their power to oppose war. This is the fundamental reason why socialist countries advocate and strive to achieve peaceful coexistence. Socialist countries believe in the superiority of their social system, and they believe that they can surpass capitalism in peaceful competition. The Soviet Union has already achieved this in the development of science and technology. Even the "New York Herald Tribune," the mouthpiece of the American monopoly capital group, had to sadly conclude in its commentary on the Soviet Union's successful launch of artificial satellites: "We have been defeated in the epic race of the twentieth century." If there can be a long-term peaceful environment in the future, it will not take many years for the Soviet Union to far exceed the United States in terms of per capita industrial and agricultural production levels. We can say with certainty that the era we are currently in is an era in which socialism and communism will continuously achieve victory.
    Of course, it should also be pointed out that peaceful coexistence is also a realistic way out for capitalist countries. Because if a third world war breaks out, although the people of all countries will suffer huge losses, the outcome, as Khrushchev pointed out, will be the collapse of the capitalist system.
    Although the proposition of peaceful coexistence is gaining momentum in the current world, Western countries, especially the United States, are still unwilling to accept this proposition. Until now, the United States and its partners have refused to accept the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals. In his speech to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on October 10, the US representative to the United Nations, Lodge, openly stated that the United States would continue to conduct nuclear tests. It can be seen that what the United States is keen on is not peaceful coexistence, but an arms race. Not only that, but in order to dominate the Middle East, the United States is also trying its best to create a new war crisis in the Middle East. Khrushchev condemned the activities of Henderson, the State Department's conspiracy expert, in the Middle East, and pointed out the serious consequences that such activities might cause. Recently, Turkish troops have gathered on the Syrian border and have been continuously carrying out armed provocations against Syria, which was done under the instructions of Dulles and Henderson. Turkey's practice of pulling chestnuts out of the fire for others by preparing for war against Syria not only exacerbated the tense situation in the Middle East, but is also extremely dangerous for itself. A country like Turkey cannot withstand the blow of a war it has caused. In his speech, Khrushchev severely condemned the United States' practice of creating a new war crisis in the Middle East, and reiterated the Soviet Union's proposition on maintaining peace in the Middle East. The Soviet Union's attitude demonstrates its deep concern for peace in the Middle East, and it is also a strong support for Arab countries struggling to maintain their independence.
    The US State Department wants to deny these well-known facts. The US State Department specifically issued a statement on the 10th, saying that Henderson had not incited certain countries in the Middle East, especially Turkey, to invade Syria. However, if Henderson, as the US State Department said, only made a visit related to his duties, why did he specifically not go to Syria, but repeatedly conduct secretive planning activities in Turkey? And after he returned to the United States from Turkey, as soon as he got off the plane, he clamored at Washington's National Airport that the situation in Syria was "extremely serious" and "related not only to the Middle East, but also to the entire free world." He even said very bluntly that he would present Dulles with "several suggestions" on how to deal with Syria. What was the purpose of Henderson's trip to the Middle East? Isn't it clear enough?
    The US State Department also attempted to deny the conspiracy of the United States to instigate Turkey to attack Syria, and used the actions of the United States during the Suez Canal crisis as evidence of the United States' intentions in the Middle East. But isn't it the troops of Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Group and the Baghdad Pact led by the United States, that are concentrated on the Syrian-Turkish border? And Turkish Prime Minister Menderes' insistence that the Syrian situation "threatens the security of the Middle East" is completely a replica of Dulles and Henderson's clamor. As for the United States' performance during the Suez Canal crisis, it is even more undeniable evidence of the United States' ambition to invade the Middle East. People have not forgotten that it was the United States that proposed the plan for the so-called "international control" of the Suez Canal, which infringed on Egypt's sovereignty. The United States did not take any measures to stop the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel. And the United States evacuated the American expatriates in Egypt completely the day before the start of the aggression by Britain, France, and Israel, proving that the United States was fully aware of the aggression plans of Britain and France. After the end of the Suez Canal crisis, the United States immediately announced the notorious "Eisenhower Doctrine" and exerted various pressures on Egypt and Syria, creating the Jordan incident. Until now, the United States is still freezing a large amount of Egyptian property. Aren't all these irrefutable facts of the United States' hostility towards the people of the Middle East? What is there for the US State Department to brag about?
    In the issue of developing international cooperation and achieving peaceful coexistence, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States is a major factor. The Soviet Union has consistently strived to promote relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, but the United States has always adopted a discriminatory, and even hostile, attitude towards the Soviet Union. The United States went back on its word on the issue of Soviet Defense Minister Zhukov's visit to the United States. This practice can only have a negative effect on promoting relations between the two countries. Despite this, Khrushchev still expressed that the Soviet Union is eager to improve relations with the United States, and hopes that the upcoming negotiations between the two countries on developing contacts can be constructive negotiations. What is the key to improving relations between the Soviet Union and the United States? The key lies in whether the United States recognizes reality and follows the principle of peaceful coexistence.
    Khrushchev's remarks pointed out the path to strive for peaceful coexistence to the people of all countries, showed the bright prospects of mankind, and issued the most severe warning to the warmongers who oppose peaceful coexistence. This is a great encouragement to progressive humanity. Peace-loving people all over the world will fight more confidently to achieve peaceful coexistence and a bright future for mankind. We are in an era of peaceful coexistence and the inevitable victory of socialism, and just as no force can stop the sun from rising, no force in the world can block the world from moving towards peaceful coexistence and the inevitable victory of socialism.

### 和平共处和社会主义必然胜利的时代

　　和平共处和社会主义必然胜利的时代
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫10月7日对“纽约时报”记者赖斯顿发表的谈话，详尽而明确地分析了当前的
  国际局势，并再度阐明了苏联的和平共处的政策。赫鲁晓夫这个谈话，无疑将引起世界爱好和平人民的欢迎和重视。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈话中指出，由于现代化超速飞机的出现、洲际火箭的发展和其他科学技术的成就，各国之间应当比以往任何时候都要更为明智地学会像好邻居似地一起生活。这正是各国人民目前所最迫切关怀的问题。不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处的必要性，现在是越来越明显了。在目前科学技术日新月异发展的情况下，如果各国之间不能学会和平共处，那就必然会招致重大的灾难。因此，实现和平共处已成为人类的共同呼声。同时这也是苏联和世界上其他爱好和平国家所努力的目标。
    苏联在科学技术上有着强大的力量和高度发展的水平，在这方面它已超过了资本主义的最先进的国家——美国。苏联拥有美国所尚未拥有的武器，即洲际弹道火箭，这从苏联能够成功地发射出人造地球卫星这件创举上得到了充分的证明。但是，尽管这样，苏联依然坚定地主张不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处。赫鲁晓夫表示，苏联愿意在现在就在整个裁军问题上达成协议，甚至各国只留民警而不要军队。在这种情况下，正如赫鲁晓夫所指出的，就将保证像洲际弹道火箭这样的工具只为和平的目的服务。
    社会主义国家不需要战争，竭尽一切力量来反对战争，这是社会主义国家主张并且力求实现和平共处的根本原因。社会主义国家相信自己的社会制度的优越性，它们相信在和平竞赛中能够胜过资本主义。苏联在科学技术的发展上已经作到了这一点。这连美国垄断资本集团的喉舌“纽约先驱论坛报”在评论苏联成功地发射人造卫星时，也不得不悲哀地作出结论说：“在二十世纪史诗般的竞赛中，我们已经遭到了失败。”如果今后能有长期的和平环境，不需要多少年，苏联就会在按人口平均计算的工农业生产水平方面远远地超过美国。我们可以肯定地说，目前我们所处的这个时代，是社会主义和共产主义将不断取得胜利的时代。
    当然，也应当指出，和平共处对于资本主义国家也是一条现实的出路。因为如果一旦爆发第三次世界大战，虽然各国人民都将遭受到巨大的损失，但是其结局正如赫鲁晓夫所指出的，将是以资本主义制度的崩溃而告终。
    和平共处的主张在目前的世界上虽然正在得势，但是西方国家，特别是美国却还不愿意接受这种主张。直到现在为止，美国及其伙伴还不肯接受苏联的裁军建议。出席联合国大会的美国代表洛奇10月10日在联大政治委员会上的发言中，就公开表示美国还要继续进行核试验。可见，美国所热衷的不是和平共处，而是军备竞赛。不但如此，美国为了独霸中东，还竭力在中东制造新的战争危机。赫鲁晓夫谴责了美国国务院的阴谋专家汉德逊在中东所进行的活动，并且指出了美国这种活动可能引起的严重后果。最近期间，土耳其军队集聚在叙利亚边境，并不断向叙利亚进行武装挑衅，就是在杜勒斯和汉德逊的指使下干出来的。土耳其准备对叙利亚进行战争的这种为人火中取栗的做法，不仅加剧了中东的紧张局势，而且对它本身也是极其危险的。土耳其这样的国家是经受不住由它引起的一场战争的打击的。赫鲁晓夫在谈话中严厉地谴责了美国在中东制造新战争危机的做法，并且重申了苏联关于维护中东地区和平的主张。苏联的这种态度表明了它对中东地区的和平深切关怀，同时这也是对为维护自己的独立而斗争的阿拉伯国家的一种强有力的支持。
    美国国务院想抵赖这些众所周知的事实。美国国务院在10日特地发表声明说，汉德逊不曾煽动中东的某些国家、特别是土耳其侵略叙利亚。可是，如果汉德逊真如美国国务院所说只是作了一次与他职务有关的访问，他为什么偏偏不去叙利亚，而一再在土耳其进行不可告人的策划活动呢？而在他从土耳其回到美国以后，一下飞机就在华盛顿的国民机场上叫嚣说，叙利亚的局势“极为严重”，“不仅同中东有关，而且同整个自由世界有关”。他甚至十分露骨地说，他将向杜勒斯提出关于怎样对付叙利亚的“几个建议”。汉德逊的中东之行的目的是什么，难道还不清楚吗？
    美国国务院还企图抵赖美国指使土耳其进攻叙利亚的阴谋，并且以美国在苏伊士运河危机时期的所作所为作为，美国在中东的意图的证据。可是在叙、土边境集中着军队的，不正是美国领导的北大西洋集团和巴格达集团的成员国土耳其的军队吗？而土耳其总理曼德列斯硬说叙利亚局势“威胁中东的安全”，就完全是杜勒斯和汉德逊的叫嚣的翻版。至于美国在苏伊士危机时期的表现，更是美国侵略中东的野心的不容抵赖的证据。人们都没有忘记，提出侵犯埃及主权的所谓“国际管制”苏伊士运河的计划的，就是美国。美国没有采取任何措施来制止英、法、以色列的侵略。而美国在英、法、以色列侵略开始的前一天，把在埃及的美国侨民撤退完毕，证明美国完全知悉英、法的侵略计划。在苏伊士运河危机结束以后，美国立即宣布了臭名远扬的“艾森豪威尔主义”，并且对埃及、叙利亚施加各方面的压力，制造约旦事件。直到现在，美国还冻结着埃及的大批财产。这一切难道不是美国敌视中东人民的推翻不了的事实吗？美国国务院还有什么值得吹嘘的呢？
    在发展国际合作、实现和平共处的问题上，苏联和美国之间的相互关系是一个重大的因素。苏联一贯努力促进苏美之间的关系，但是美国却一直对苏联采取歧视的、甚至是敌视的态度。对苏联国防部长朱可夫访问美国的问题，美国出尔反尔，自食其言。这种做法对促进两国的关系只能产生消极的作用。虽然如此，赫鲁晓夫依然表示，苏联渴望着改善同美国的关系，并且希望即将开始的两国之间关于发展接触的谈判能够成为建设性的谈判。苏美两国改善关系的关键何在呢？关键就在于美国是否承认现实和遵循和平共处的原则。
    赫鲁晓夫的谈话向各国人民指出了争取和平共处的道路，展示了人类美好的前景，并且对反对和平共处的好战分子提出了最严厉的警告。这是对进步人类的一个很大的鼓舞力量。全世界爱好和平的人民将更满怀信心地为实现和平共处和人类美好的将来而坚决奋斗。我们正处在和平共处和社会主义必然胜利的时代，像任何力量都拦不住太阳上升一样，世界上没有任何力量能阻塞世界走向和平共处和社会主义必然胜利的道路。
