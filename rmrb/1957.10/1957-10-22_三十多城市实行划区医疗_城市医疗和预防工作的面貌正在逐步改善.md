    District-Based Healthcare Implemented in Over Thirty Cities
    The Landscape of Urban Medical and Preventive Work is Gradually Improving

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since the Ministry of Health issued the "Instructions on Improving 'District-Based Healthcare Service' Work" in June of this year, more than thirty large and medium-sized cities in fifteen provinces, including Liaoning and Zhejiang, have successively begun implementation. "District-based healthcare service" is based on learning from the advanced experience of Soviet healthcare, correctly combining it with the specific conditions of China's medical and health undertakings, and conducting key trials in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin to gain experience.

    Judging from the implementation in various cities, preliminary good results have been achieved. Through district-based healthcare, the overall medical and health situation of the entire city has been grasped, giving direction to the transformation and construction of urban medical and preventive work and overcoming blindness in development. For example, Beijing, in response to the past irrational distribution of medical institutions, established the Qianmen District Hospital, expanded outpatient clinics, and relocated a maternity hospital in the Qianmen District, which had a population of 200,000 but no municipal hospital or maternity beds. Currently, the city has basically ensured that each street office area has a grassroots medical institution. Secondly, the establishment of business and technical leadership relationships between medical institutions at all levels has changed the past isolated and scattered state. It has also enabled the organized cultivation and training of medical cadres, gradually improving the quality of medical care. For example, after the Shanghai Second Labor Hospital implemented district-based healthcare, it organized more than 600 in-service doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine, and more than 300 junior and intermediate health personnel, to study through consultations, referrals, amateur study classes, and medical lectures, improving the professional and technical level of grassroots medical personnel in the Yangpu District. Thirdly, the rational adjustment of medical contracts and the organization of people to seek medical treatment have reduced the congestion in large hospitals, greatly leveraging the potential of grassroots medical institutions, and benefiting workers and residents. For example, in Beijing, the daily outpatient burden per physician in 1956 compared to 1955 decreased from 12.7 visits to 11.8 visits in large hospitals, while it increased from 16.1 to 27.6 in urban joint clinics, and from 27.9 to 34.9 in outpatient departments. At the same time, 79% of patients seeking medical treatment at grassroots medical institutions were local residents. Statistics of outpatient visits in the third quarter of 1956 in Yangpu District, Shanghai, showed that outpatient visits to joint clinics increased more than fourfold compared to before the implementation of district-based healthcare, while the pediatrics department of the Shanghai Second Labor Hospital decreased by 23.9%. Fourthly, medical work focuses on guaranteeing national construction, giving priority to production needs, so that factories and enterprises have fixed medical institutions to serve the health of workers. Hospital medical staff delve into factory workshops, study occupational diseases and common diseases, and help improve the quality of factory medical personnel, further strengthening industrial hygiene work. Fifthly, medical work is closer to the masses, and medical and epidemic prevention work are organically combined, improving prevention effects. For example, during the measles epidemic in Shanghai in 1956, due to the strengthening of home visits and outpatient work by medical personnel, and relying on residential organizations to play the role of Red Cross members, the measles mortality rate in Yangpu District decreased from 1.62% in 1955 to 0.4% in 1956. Finally, as general patients seek medical treatment at grassroots medical institutions, large hospitals have reduced congestion and increased the variety of diseases. For example, in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Beijing Tongren Hospital (the Municipal Central Hospital), physiological births and pathological births previously accounted for 50% each, while after the implementation of district-based healthcare, physiological births accounted for only 10%, and pathological births increased.

    After the implementation of district-based healthcare in many cities, the landscape of urban medical and preventive work has improved, not only gaining the support of the majority of medical personnel but also winning praise from the majority of workers and the masses.

    三十多城市实行划区医疗
    城市医疗和预防工作的面貌正在逐步改善
    本报讯　自从今年6月卫生部发布了“关于改进‘划区医疗服务’工作的指示”以来，全国已有辽宁、浙江等十五个省三十多个大中城市先后开始实行。“划区医疗服务”，是学习苏联保健事业的先进经验，正确结合我国医疗卫生事业的具体情况，在北京、上海和天津等城市重点试行取得经验的基础上进行的。
    从各城市实行的情况看，都初步收到了良好的效果。通过划区医疗，首先掌握了整个城市的医疗卫生情况，使城市医疗预防工作的改造和建设有了方向、克服了发展上的盲目性。如北京市针对过去医疗机构分布不合理的情况，在有二十万人口而没有一个市属医院、没有一张产床的前门区，经过合并改组成立了前门区医院，增建了门诊部，迁移去一个产院。目前全市基本上做到每一个街道办事处范围内都有了一个基层医疗机构。其次，各级医疗机构之间由于建立了业务、技术领导关系，改变了过去孤立分散的状态，有组织地培养训练了医务干部，使医疗质量逐步得到提高。如上海市第二劳工医院在划区医疗后，通过会诊、转诊，举办业余学习班和医学讲座等形式，先后组织在职中西医六百多人、中初级卫生人员三百多人进修学习，提高了杨浦区广大基层医务人员的业务、技术水平。第三，由于合理调整了医疗合同和组织群众就医，减少了大医院的忙乱，大大地发挥了基层医疗机构的潜力，便利了职工居民。如北京市1956年比1955年每名医师每日门诊负担量，大医院由十二点七人次降到十一点八人次，而城区联合诊所则由十六点一增加到二十七点六，门诊部由二十七点九增加到三十四点九；同时到基层医疗机构看病的已有79％是本地段的病人。上海市杨浦区1956年第三季度门诊量的统计，联合诊所门诊量比划区医疗前增加四倍多，而市第二劳工医院小儿科却降低了23.9％。第四，使医疗工作以保证国家建设为重点，首先照顾了生产需要，使工厂企业有固定的医疗机构为职工健康服务。医院医务人员深入工厂车间，研究职业病多发病，并帮助提高工厂医务人员的质量，进一步加强了工业卫生工作。第五，使医疗工作更接近于群众，使医疗与防疫工作有机配合起来，提高了预防效果。如上海市1956年麻疹流行，由于医务人员加强访视出诊工作，依靠居民组织发挥红十字会员作用，杨浦区麻疹病死率1955年是1.62％，1956年降低到0.4％；最后，由于一般病人到基层医疗机构看病，大医院减少了忙乱，增加了病种。如北京市同仁医院（是市中心医院）妇产科以前生理产和病理产各占50％，而实行划区医疗后生理产仅为10％，病理产增多。
    不少城市实行划区医疗后，改善了城市医疗预防工作面貌，不仅得到了广大医务人员的支持，也取得了广大职工和群众的好评。
