Rightists' Anti-Socialist Activities in the Field of History
Jian Bozan

The bourgeois rightists' conspiracy to restore the bourgeois so-called "social sciences" is not limited to sociology, economics, and other fields, but also includes history. I will now say a few words about history in this regard.

Since liberation, the majority of Chinese historians have initially criticized the bourgeois historical viewpoints, learned to use Marxism-Leninism to study history, and supported the socialist path. However, there are still a few bourgeois rightists and people with rightist ideas who have been resisting Marxism to varying degrees, opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, and opposing socialism. These people were somewhat restrained in the past few years, but around the time of the Zhang-Luo alliance's launch of an attack on the Party and socialism, they openly published various fallacies and engaged in political attacks on the Communist Party under the guise of academics, completely exposing their true colors.

Rightists in the historical field have many common points, mainly in the following aspects:

First, like rightists in other departments, rightists in the historical field and some people with rightist ideas are all opposed to Marxism-Leninism. For example, Lei Haizong, Xiang Da, Rong Mengyuan, and others have all published such fallacies. They all oppose the application of Marxism to the study of history in principle. Historical science is a science with a strong class nature, and like economics, the special nature of its materials will arouse the most intense, base, and evil emotions in people's hearts, and summon the gods of revenge representing class interests to the battlefield to defend the interests of the historian's own class. Therefore, in this aspect, the rightists launched a frantic and open attack on Marxism-Leninism with the most vicious hostility. They vainly attempted to overthrow Marxism-Leninism in the field of historical science and allow bourgeois historical science to be restored in China.

Lei Haizong used a so-called "Athenian Constitution" as a weapon to attack Marxist historical science. He published absurd and outrageous clichés such as the stagnation theory, the outdated theory, and the incompatibility with national conditions theory of Marxism. He slanderously described the science of socialist countries as worthless, while on the other hand, he praised the so-called "social sciences" of his beloved capitalist countries to the sky. He said: "The social sciences of the entire socialist camp are too weak and too poor." "The low level of Soviet historical science is astonishing. The works of Soviet scholars, in the eyes of the capitalist academic world, are not even qualified for comment. It can be said that they are not scientific works." He even said: Marxist "classical writers wrote very few books on history, and only a few were written as assignments." While in capitalist countries, "one can clearly point out which schools and representative works it has." He also said: "In the past sixty years, the social sciences of the world (the capitalist world) have continued to develop new things, constantly adding new materials, and constantly having new understandings and new interpretations of old materials. But these are equivalent to non-existent for the social science circles in our socialist camp. Today, we are still satisfied with the individual statements made by Marx and Engels sixty to one hundred years ago on issues under the conditions of their knowledge and data at the time." He truly exhausted his ability to slander Marxism. Lei Haizong's fallacy is mainly that Marxism is outdated. In reality, what is outdated is not Marxism but the so-called scientific methods of the bourgeoisie. Not to mention the era when the bourgeoisie is already on the verge of decline, even in the youth of this class, the so-called scientific methods of the bourgeoisie are, as Marx said, "like a clumsy packhorse, at a loss when faced with essence and phenomenon, cause and effect." But Lei Haizong said that this "clumsy packhorse" showed a miracle of rapid progress when it was dying, isn't it a myth?

Xiang Da attacked by raising the issue of history only blooming with five flowers. The five flowers he referred to are the issue of periodization of Chinese history, the issue of capitalist sprouts, the issue of peasant wars, the issue of feudal land ownership, and the issue of the formation of the Han nationality. It should be pointed out that the issue of the five flowers raised by Xiang Da does not conform to the facts. Since liberation, we have focused on discussing these five issues. There is nothing wrong with discussing these five issues, because they are key issues in history. However, in addition to this, we have also raised many new issues in the field of history, including major and minor issues. However, Xiang Da only saw these five issues. In his words, he only saw these "five flowers," and he hated these five flowers the most. Why? The reason is very simple: it is because these five flowers are flowers bloomed by Marxist historical science, and only Marxist historical science can bloom these five flowers. Precisely because of this, Xiang Da was unhappy and spread it everywhere, as if this was the crime of Chinese history since liberation. Xiang Da not only opposed the use of Marxism to study history, but also despised Marxism. When Mr. Tang Yongtong made a postscript to the reprint of his book "History of Buddhism in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties," he mentioned "attempting to point out the shortcomings of this book from the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism." Xiang Da said: "This is lowering one's status." Obviously, in his opinion, only insisting on the bourgeois position and viewpoint is superior.

If Lei Haizong and Xiang Da were standing on the bourgeois position to oppose Marxism, attempting to replace Marxism with comprador and bourgeois historical science, then Rong Mengyuan advocated restorationism, attempting to replace Marxist historical science with mainly feudal historical science. Rong Mengyuan fully exposed his reactionary thinking in the initial draft of his "Suggestions for Compiling Historical Materials Since the Revolution of 1911." In this article, not a single word mentioned Marxism, but instead opposed Marxism in an obscure tone. He said: "Currently, historical materials since the Revolution of 1911, apart from original materials, are mostly papers with narration and commentary intertwined. Papers are of course necessary, but using papers to replace everything hinders the study of historical science." Judging from the context, the papers Rong Mengyuan referred to are papers written from a Marxist perspective. In Rong Mengyuan's view, such papers hinder the development of historical science. He also said: "Annals inherit our country's historical tradition, which should be both straightforward and unhidden, and should also pay attention to calligraphy, that is, pay attention to standpoints, viewpoints, and methods."

We have never opposed annals. We believe that although annals have their shortcomings, they are still one of the excellent traditions in our country's historical material compilation. Therefore, after liberation, we organized and published the "Zizhi Tongjian." However, using the method of annals to arrange historical materials does not exclude the application of new standpoints and viewpoints; conversely, applying new standpoints and viewpoints to study history does not mean that one cannot be "straightforward and unhidden." However, it is not difficult to see that Rong Mengyuan is pitting straightforwardness and unhiddenness against standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, as if standing on the proletariat's position and applying the Marxist viewpoint and method to study history means that one cannot be straightforward and unhidden. This is a malicious slander against Marxist historical science. After attacking Marxism, Rong Mengyuan put forward suggestions for compiling various historical books that do not use Marxism or are anti-Marxist. Acting according to Rong Mengyuan's suggestions would inevitably lead Chinese history back to the old path of feudalism.

Despite the fact that the rightists described bourgeois and even feudal landlord class history in rose-colored terms, it is impossible to pull Chinese history backward, because the time is too late. Marx said: "The same thing is a finished product for one century, but for another century, it is only a raw material used for new production." Bourgeois and even feudal landlord class history both have their own centuries, and their centuries have passed. Therefore, even if there are some useful parts in them, they can only be used as raw materials for Marxist historical science.

Second, bourgeois rightists and some people with serious rightist ideas not only oppose Marxism, but also launch vicious attacks on the leadership of the Communist Party. Xiang Da, Lei Haizong, Rong Mengyuan, and others are all like this. Xiang Da made a lot of attacks on the Party's leadership in the Academy of Sciences in many meetings. He said that the leadership of the Academy of Sciences is laymen leading professionals. Some administrative leading Party member cadres are laymen who "don't understand the business at all." He said that the Party's leadership in the Academy of Sciences is "like Zhang Zongchang leading troops," comparing the Communist Party to the Northern Warlords. Xiang Da often threw his official hat on the ground, which means he wanted to protest to the laymen. Xiang Da himself opposed the leadership of the Communist Party, thinking that others also opposed the leadership of the Communist Party like him. What he called laymen is the Communist Party. Xiang Da also acted like a master, calling for this one to step down and that one to step down. As a first-level professor at Peking University, the director of the library, and a member of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Academy of Sciences, and the deputy director of the Second Institute of History, he did not regard these as the extraordinary glory given to him by the people, but instead slandered the Party for being "both laymen and distrustful of people." He viciously slandered the Party for having the idea of "those who are not of my race must have different hearts" towards non-Party members, saying that "the Academy of Sciences is a big beehive of sectarianism." He arbitrarily provoked by saying that the Party regarded scientists as "street vagrants," "coming when called and leaving when waved away." He threatened: "What do you think of us scientists? We are being bullied, and I want to sue."

Lei Haizong also fired poisonous arrows at the Party's leadership. He slandered that "Chinese intellectuals can be ranked first in the world in the history of the ability to remain silent." He said that after liberation, intellectuals "generally remain silent, or can only hope that they will utter a set of false words." Everyone please note that what Lei Haizong said after liberation were all "false words," not a single "truth." Everyone knows that the most basic requirement of history is authenticity. How can a person who says false words against his will give students correct historical knowledge? We hope that he will speak the truth in his heart. Lei Haizong also talked about not letting the Party "issue orders" in his article, and threatened that otherwise, intellectuals would tell lies or "not be in their position, not seek their politics" and passively resist.

Rong Mengyuan was also extremely hostile to our criticism of bourgeois ideology. In the aforementioned article, he distorted and fabricated some words said by Party members, and then attacked by saying, "I think this statement is very ignorant, but I can only slander in my heart, not dare to say it out loud. Slandering in my heart should be beheaded, but if I don't express it, others won't know, what can I do." He simply regarded Communist Party members as feudal autocratic monarchs, and the depth of his hatred can be imagined.

All of these show that rightists and people with rightist ideas are all hiding under the banner of anti-sectarianism, shouting the slogan that laymen cannot lead professionals, in order to oppose the Communist Party's leadership over social sciences, so as to realize the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance to abolish the scientific locomotive in the anti-socialist scientific program.

Third, another common characteristic of rightists and people with rightist ideas is that they are all looking for the shortcomings of the Communist Party everywhere during the day with lanterns, while pretending not to see or not wanting to see the rapid development of historical science under the leadership of the Party since liberation. They describe historical science after liberation as pitch black. Xiang Da said: "The reason why the historical circle is now dying is inseparable from Fan Wenlan's sectarianism." He also said: "People in the historical circle have been in low spirits in the past few years." He asked with his eyes closed: "The historical circle has not been doing well since liberation, should the people in the Party responsible for it be held responsible?" May I ask Xiang Da, where did you see that the current historical circle is "dying" and "in low spirits"? And where did you see that it is inseparable from Fan Wenlan's sectarianism? Taking research institutions as an example, before liberation, there was only one Institute of History and Philology. After liberation, there are three Institutes of History, one Institute of Archeology, and one Institute of Linguistics. Why is it instead dying? Taking universities as an example, before the adjustment of departments, the Department of History of Peking University only had 159 students. Now there are more than 500 students, as well as 11 international students and 41 foreign students. Why is it instead in low spirits?

Lei Haizong also behaved very badly in this regard. He spread a lot of poison to the students. He said that the books published after liberation "have nothing to read," and said that these books "have poor content and chaotic logic." He even viciously slandered: "The worst books before liberation are better than the current ones." "The books published after liberation have no academic value, and reading them makes the brain stiff. From a professional point of view, one should read more books published before liberation," and so on.

The purpose of all these fallacies is to deny our achievements in historical science, deny the superiority of the socialist system, and find reasons for the restoration of bourgeois historical science.

Fourth, another common characteristic of rightists and people with rightist ideas is that they all have strong personal ambitions. Xiang Da, Wang Zhonghan, Rong Mengyuan, and others are all like this, but they each feel that the size of their "capital" is different, so their ambitions vary. Xiang Da attached great importance to personal power. When he served as the director of the library of Peking University, he turned the library into an independent small kingdom. When he served as the deputy director of the Second Institute of History, he paid close attention to whether he was the first deputy director or the second deputy director. He often became emotional when his personal power desires were not met. He mistakenly believed that the Communist Party was tough and not soft, and that the Communist Party was weak and could be deceived. He repeatedly said that he did not want to be an official, and that others were all officials. Recently, in order to satisfy his personal ambitions, Xiang Da even disregarded the interests of the 700,000 Miao and Tujia people in western Hunan, and colluded with rightist Pan Guangdan and a few rightist elements among the Tujia people in western Hunan, and carried out many anti-Party activities. According to the revealed materials, they carried out a series of activities to provoke and split relations between the Miao and Tujia people, internal relations among the Tujia people, relations between the Tujia people and the Party, relations between the province and the Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and relations between the central government and local governments. According to the exposure of comrades from the Hunan Nationalities Committee, a small group of rightists among the Tujia people in western Hunan had already discussed with Xiang Da and asked him to be the head of their autonomous prefecture for the separate autonomy of the Tujia people in their conspiracy. They also conspired to expand their power and establish autonomous regions spanning several provinces. Needless to say, if this conspiracy succeeds, Xiang Da can be the chairman of this ideal autonomous region. Rong Mengyuan's ambition seems to be to be the director of a "History Museum of the Republic of China." Professor Wang Zhonghan, a rightist from the Department of History of the Nationalities Institute, conspired to organize a joint association of various democratic parties, attempting to seize the leadership of the entire school in the name of "supervising rectification and guaranteeing free airing of views."

All of these show that the rightists are all taking advantage of the fire to rob, attempting to seize the leadership of the social sciences, and some rightists have even developed to seizing political leadership.

The rightists may say that the fallacies they published are academic research issues, and academic research belongs to the scope of the Hundred Schools of Thought. Doesn't the Communist Party want to continue to implement the policy of the Hundred Schools of Thought? Yes, the Communist Party wants to implement and will continue to implement the policy of the Hundred Schools of Thought, and we firmly support this policy. Differences in academic opinions can be freely debated, and we can continue to have major debates and disputes, as it has been in the past and will continue to be in the future. But just as President Guo Moruo said, "Academic research is one thing, and carrying out anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities under the guise of academic research is another. There is a clear line between the two, and this line must not be confused." The activities carried out by the rightists and people with rightist ideas in the historical field are not academic activities in essence, but a part of the anti-Party and anti-socialist political conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance. It is not a dispute between materialism and idealism in academics, but to fundamentally change the direction of historical science and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism.

The above are not all the situations in the historical field. In this reactionary wave, many rightists and people with rightist ideas have also emerged in universities and historical research institutions across the country. In view of this, I believe that our historical field should launch a national-scale anti-rightist struggle to further expose and criticize the rightists and rightist remarks in the historical field. This is necessary for the development of historical science and the defense of socialism. We must hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, launch a firm and merciless counterattack against the rightists, eliminate the negative influences they have left in history, and smash their reactionary conspiracy to change the direction of history and seize the leadership of history.

    右派在历史学方面的反社会主义活动
    翦伯赞
    资产阶级右派分子对于恢复资产阶级的所谓“社会科学”的阴谋活动，不只限于社会学、经济学等部分，也包括历史学在内。我现在就历史学这方面说几句话。
    解放以来，我国大多数的史学工作者都初步地批判了资产阶级的历史学观点，学习运用马克思列宁主义来研究历史，拥护社会主义的道路。但是还有少数资产阶级右派分子和具有右派思想的人，他们一直是在不同的程度上抗拒马克思主义，反对共产党的领导，反对社会主义。这些人在过去几年中尚有所顾忌，在章罗联盟发动向党向社会主义进攻的前后，就明目张胆地发表了各种谬论，并假借学术的名义对共产党进行政治性的攻击活动，彻底暴露了他们的本来面目。
    历史学界的右派分子有很多共同点，主要的有下列几方面：
    第一，和其他部门的右派分子一样，历史学界的右派分子和一些具有右派思想的人没有一个不是反对马克思列宁主义的。例如雷海宗、向达、荣孟源等都发表了这样的谬论，他们都是从原则上反对应用马克思主义来研究历史。历史科学是一种具有强烈的阶级性的科学，它和经济学一样，它的材料的特殊性质就会把人心中最激烈最卑鄙最恶劣的感情唤起，把代表阶级利益的仇神召到战场上来辩护历史家自己所属的阶级的利益。因而在这一方面右派分子就带着最恶毒的敌意，向马克思列宁主义进行了疯狂的公开的进攻。他们妄想在历史科学领域中反掉马克思列宁主义，让资产阶级历史学在中国复辟。
    雷海宗用一本所谓“雅典宪法”作武器，向马克思主义的历史科学进攻。他发表了荒谬绝伦的马克思主义停滞论、过时论和不合国情论等等陈腔滥调。他诬蔑地把社会主义国家的科学说成一钱不值，而在另一方面则把他心爱的资本主义国家的所谓“社会科学”捧上了天。他说：“整个社会主义阵营的社会科学太薄弱、太贫乏”。“苏联历史科学水平之低是惊人的，苏联学者的著作，在资本主义学术界看来连评论的资格也够不上，可以说不是科学作品”。甚至说：马克思主义“经典作家写历史的书很少，仅有几本也是赶任务的书”。而在资本主义国家则“可以清楚地指出它有那些学派，那些代表性的著作”。又说：“最近六十年来，世界（资本主义世界）的社会科学仍在不断的有新的发展，不断地增加新的材料，对旧材料不断地有新的认识新的解释。但这些对我们社会主义阵营的社会科学界来说是等于不存在的。我们今天仍满足于六十年到一百年前马克思和恩格斯在当时的认识条件和资料条件下对问题所说的个别的语句”。他对于马克思主义真是极尽诬蔑之能事。雷海宗的谬论，主要的是说马克思主义过了时，实际上过了时的，不是马克思主义而是资产阶级的所谓科学方法。慢说资产阶级已经临于没落的时代，就是在这个阶级的青年时代，资产阶级的所谓科学方法，也是像马克思所说的，“好像是一匹笨重的驮马，面临本质与现象，结果与原因，就一筹莫展了。”而雷海宗却说这匹“笨重的驮马”到了垂死的时候反而出现了一日千里的奇迹，岂不是神话。
    向达则提出历史学只开五朵花的问题，来进行攻击。他所指的五朵花，就是中国历史分期问题，资本主义萌芽问题，农民战争问题，封建土地所有制问题，汉民族形成问题。应该指出，向达提出的五朵花的问题，是不符合事实的。解放以来我们是着重地讨论了这五个问题，讨论这五个问题并没有错，因为它们是历史上带有关键性的问题，不过除此以外，在历史学方面我们还提出了很多新的问题，其中有大问题，也有小问题。然而向达就只看到这五个问题，用他的话说，只看到这“五朵花”，而且最讨厌这五朵花。为什么，原因很简单，就是因为这五朵花是马克思主义历史学开出的花朵，而且只有马克思主义历史学才能开出这五朵花来。正因为如此，向达就不高兴，到处宣传，好像这就是解放以来中国历史学的罪状。向达不仅反对用马克思主义研究历史，而且十分轻蔑马克思主义。汤用彤先生在他的著作“魏晋南北朝佛教史”重版时作了一个后记，里面说到“试图用马列主义的观点指出本书的缺点”。向达就说：“这是降低身分”。显然照他看来，只有坚持资产阶级的立场观点才是高人一等。
    如果说雷海宗和向达是站在资产阶级的立场上来反对马克思主义，企图用买办阶级的和资产阶级的历史学来代替马克思主义，荣孟源则主张复古主义，企图用主要是封建主义的历史学来代替马克思主义的历史学。荣孟源在他的“建议编撰辛亥革命以来的历史资料”一文的初稿中，充分地暴露了他的这种反动思想。在这篇文章中，没有一个字提到马克思主义，而是以一种隐晦的笔调反对马克思主义。他说：“目前辛亥革命以来的历史，除原始资料之外，多是夹叙夹议的论文。论文固然是必要的，但以论文来代替一切，那就妨害了历史科学的研究。”从前后文看来，荣孟源所谓的论文，就是指的用马克思主义观点所写的论文。这种论文，在荣孟源看来，是妨害了历史科学的发展的。他又说“编年史继承我国的历史传统，既要直言无隐，又应注意书法，即注意立场观点和方法。”
    我们从来没有反对过编年史，我们认为编年史虽然也有它的缺点，但仍然是我国史料编纂学中的优良传统之一，所以解放以后，我们把“资治通鉴”整理出版了。不过用编年体的方法来编排史料，并不排除应用新的立场和观点；反之应用新的立场和观点来研究历史不是就不能“直言无隐”，然而不难看出，荣孟源是把直言无隐和立场观点方法对立起来，好像站在无产阶级的立场，应用马克思主义的观点方法来研究历史就不能直言无隐，这对于马克思主义的历史学是一种恶毒的污蔑。荣孟源在攻击了马克思主义之后，提出了编撰各种不要马克思主义或反马克思主义历史书的建议。按照荣孟源的建议去行事，就必然要使中国的历史学退回到封建主义的老路上去。
    尽管右派分子用玫瑰的颜色来描写资产阶级的乃至封建地主阶级的历史学，但是要想把中国的历史学拉着倒退是不行的，原因就是时间太迟了。马克思说过：“同一件东西对某一个世纪是一个完成品，但对另一世纪，只是用到新的生产去的原料而已。”资产阶级的乃至封建地主阶级的历史学，都有他自己的世纪，它们的世纪已经过去了。因此即使在它们中间有一些有用的部分，也只能作为马克思主义历史学的原料了。
    第二，资产阶级右派分子和一些具有严重右派思想的人不仅反对马克思主义，也对共产党的领导进行恶毒的攻击，向达、雷海宗、荣孟源等都是这样。向达在很多会议上的发言中对科学院的党的领导大肆攻击。他说科学院的领导是外行领导内行。一些行政领导的党员干部都是外行，“根本不懂业务”。他说科学院的党的领导“有如张宗昌带兵”，把共产党比作北洋军阀。向达经常摔纱帽，也就是表示自己要向外行抗议。向达自己反对共产党的领导，以为别人也和他一样反对共产党的领导。他所谓外行就是共产党。向达还以老爷自居，叫这个下台，那个下台。他身为北京大学的一级教授、图书馆馆长，又是科学院的哲学社会科学部的学部委员，历史研究所第二所的副所长。他不把这些看作是人民给他的破格的光荣，反而诬蔑党“既外行又不信任人”。他恶毒地诬蔑党对非党人士有“非我族类，其心必异”的思想，“科学院是宗派主义的大蜂窝”。他恣意挑拨说党把科学家看作“街头流浪者”，“呼之则来，挥之则去”。他威胁地说：“把我们科学家当成什么人看？我们是受气，我要控诉”。
    对于党的领导雷海宗也放射了毒箭。他诬蔑“中国知识分子一言不发的本领在全世界的历史上可以考第一名”。他说解放后知识分子
  “一般地是一言不发的，或者只能希望他们发的一套假言”。大家请注意雷海宗在解放以后所说的都是“假言”没有一句“真话”，大家都知道历史学最基本的要求就是真实性，一个言不由衷的专说假话的人，怎么能给学生以正确的历史知识。我们希望他把心里的真话说出来。雷海宗在文章中还谈到不要党“发号施令”，并威胁地说，不然，知识分子就要说假话，或者“不在其位，不谋其政”地消极怠工了。
    荣孟源也极端仇视我们对资产阶级思想的批判。他在前述文章里，歪曲和捏造了一些党员说的话，然后攻击说“我认为这说法很无知，可是只能腹诽，不敢说出口来，腹诽应当杀头，但无所表示，他人不知，其奈我何”。他简直是把共产党员看做封建专制的君主，其心怀仇恨之深是可想而知了。
    所有这些都说明了右派分子和具有右派思想的人都是隐蔽在反宗派主义的幌子之下，叫着外行不能领导内行的口号，来反对共产党对社会科学的领导，以便实现章罗联盟反社会主义科学纲领中取消科学的火车头的阴谋。
    第三，右派分子和具有右派思想的人还有一个共同的特点，他们都是在白天打着灯笼到处寻找共产党的缺点，而对于解放以后在党的领导之下的历史科学的迅速发展，则装作没有看见，或者不愿看见。他们把解放以后的历史科学说成漆黑一团。向达说：“现在史学界之所以奄奄一息是和范文澜的宗派主义分不开的。”又说：“这几年史学界的人意气消沉”。他闭着眼睛问：“历史界解放后这样不行，党里负责的人要不要负责”。请问向达，你从那里看出现在的史学界是“奄奄一息”，“意气消沉”？又从那里看出是和范文澜的宗派主义分不开？以研究机关而论，解放以前只有一个历史语言研究所，解放以后有三个历史研究所、一个考古研究所、一个语言研究所，为什么反而奄奄一息呢？以大学而论，院系调整以前，北大历史系只有一百五十九个学生，现在有了五百以上的学生，还有十一个国家派来的留学生四十一人，为什么反而意气消沉呢？
    在这方面雷海宗也表现得很恶劣，他对学生散布了很多毒素。他说解放后出的书“没有什么可看的”，说这些书“内容贫乏，逻辑混乱”。甚至恶毒地诬蔑：“解放前最坏的书都比现在的好。”“解放后出的书没有学术价值，读了使脑筋僵化。就业务观点说，应该多读解放前出的书”等等。
    所有这些谬论，其目的都是企图否定我们在历史科学方面的成绩，否定社会主义制度的优越性，替资产阶级历史学的复辟寻找理由。
    第四，右派分子和具有右派思想的人还有一个共同特点，就是他们都具有强烈的个人野心。向达、王钟翰、荣孟源等人都是如此，不过他们各人觉得自己的“本钱”的大小不同，因而野心大小有别。向达对于个人权力非常重视，他担任北京大学的图书馆馆长，就把该馆搞成一个独立小王国。他在历史研究所第二所任副所长，就十分注意是第一副所长还是第二副所长。他为了个人权力欲望不满足时常闹情绪。他错误地以为共产党吃硬不吃软，认为共产党软弱可欺。他口口声声说自己不想做官，说别人都是官。近来向达为了满足个人野心，甚至置七十多万人的湘西苗族和土家族的利益于不顾，和右派分子潘光旦以及湘西土家族中的少数右派分子勾结在一起，进行了很多反党的活动。根据揭发的材料，他们在苗族和土家的关系，土家内部的关系，土家与党的关系，省与苗族自治州的关系，中央与地方的关系各方面进行了一系列的挑拨和分裂的活动。又据湖南民族委员会同志的揭发，湘西土家族中的一小撮右派分子已经和向达商量，请他去当他们阴谋中的土家族单独自治的自治州长。他们还阴谋扩大势力，建立跨有几省的自治区。不用说，这个阴谋如果成功，向达就可以当这个理想中的自治区的主席了。荣孟源的野心看来是想当个“民国史馆”的馆长。民族学院历史系教授右派分子王钟翰，阴谋组织各民主党派联合会，借“监督整风，保障大鸣大放”为名，企图夺取整个学校的领导权。
    所有这些，都说明了右派分子都是趁火打劫，企图夺取对社会科学的领导权，有些右派分子并且发展到夺取政治领导权。
    右派分子也许说，他们发表的谬论是学术研究问题，而学术研究是属于百家争鸣的范围，共产党不是要继续贯彻百家争鸣的方针吗？是的，共产党是要贯彻而且还要继续贯彻百家争鸣的方针，我们也坚决拥护这个方针。学术上的意见分歧是可以自由争辩，而且还可以继续大争大辩，过去如此，今后还是如此。但是正像郭沫若院长所说的
  “学术研究是一回事，假借学术研究的名义，进行反共反社会主义活动又是一回事。这中间有一条明显的界线，这条界线是绝对不能混淆的”。史学界的右派分子和具有右派思想的人所进行的活动，实质上不是学术活动，而是章罗联盟反党反社会主义的政治阴谋活动的一部分，不是学术上的唯物与唯心之争，而是为了根本改变历史科学的方向替资本主义的复辟铺平道路。
    以上所举的还不是史学界的全部情况。在这次反动的风浪中，在全国各大学中和历史研究机构中还出现了不少的右派分子和具有右派思想的人。有鉴于此，我认为我们史学界应该开展一个全国规模的反右派斗争，来进一步揭发和批判史学界的右派分子和右派言论。这对于发展历史科学、保卫社会主义都是必要的。我们要高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，在共产党领导之下，对右派分子进行坚决的无情的反击，消灭他们在历史学上留下来的恶劣影响，粉碎他们企图改变历史学路线夺取历史学领导权的反动阴谋。
