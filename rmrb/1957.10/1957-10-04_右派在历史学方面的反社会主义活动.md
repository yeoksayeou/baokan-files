Rightists' Anti-Socialist Activities in the Field of History
Jian Bozan

The bourgeois rightists' conspiracy to restore the bourgeois so-called "social sciences" is not limited to sociology, economics, and other fields, but also includes history. I will now say a few words about history in this regard.

Since liberation, the majority of Chinese historians have initially criticized the bourgeois historical viewpoints, learned to use Marxism-Leninism to study history, and supported the socialist path. However, there are still a few bourgeois rightists and people with rightist ideas who have been resisting Marxism to varying degrees, opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, and opposing socialism. These people were somewhat restrained in the past few years, but around the time of the Zhang-Luo alliance's launch of an attack on the Party and socialism, they openly published various fallacies and engaged in political attacks on the Communist Party under the guise of academics, completely exposing their true colors.

Rightists in the historical field have many common points, mainly in the following aspects:

First, like rightists in other departments, rightists in the historical field and some people with rightist ideas are all opposed to Marxism-Leninism. For example, Lei Haizong, Xiang Da, Rong Mengyuan, and others have all published such fallacies. They all oppose the application of Marxism to the study of history in principle. Historical science is a science with a strong class nature, and like economics, the special nature of its materials will arouse the most intense, base, and evil emotions in people's hearts, and summon the gods of revenge representing class interests to the battlefield to defend the interests of the historian's own class. Therefore, in this aspect, the rightists launched a frantic and open attack on Marxism-Leninism with the most vicious hostility. They vainly attempted to overthrow Marxism-Leninism in the field of historical science and allow bourgeois historical science to be restored in China.

Lei Haizong used a so-called "Athenian Constitution" as a weapon to attack Marxist historical science. He published absurd and outrageous clich√©s such as the stagnation theory, the outdated theory, and the incompatibility with national conditions theory of Marxism. He slanderously described the science of socialist countries as worthless, while on the other hand, he praised the so-called "social sciences" of his beloved capitalist countries to the sky. He said: "The social sciences of the entire socialist camp are too weak and too poor." "The low level of Soviet historical science is astonishing. The works of Soviet scholars, in the eyes of the capitalist academic world, are not even qualified for comment. It can be said that they are not scientific works." He even said: Marxist "classical writers wrote very few books on history, and only a few were written as assignments." While in capitalist countries, "one can clearly point out which schools and representative works it has." He also said: "In the past sixty years, the social sciences of the world (the capitalist world) have continued to develop new things, constantly adding new materials, and constantly having new understandings and new interpretations of old materials. But these are equivalent to non-existent for the social science circles in our socialist camp. Today, we are still satisfied with the individual statements made by Marx and Engels sixty to one hundred years ago on issues under the conditions of their knowledge and data at the time." He truly exhausted his ability to slander Marxism. Lei Haizong's fallacy is mainly that Marxism is outdated. In reality, what is outdated is not Marxism but the so-called scientific methods of the bourgeoisie. Not to mention the era when the bourgeoisie is already on the verge of decline, even in the youth of this class, the so-called scientific methods of the bourgeoisie are, as Marx said, "like a clumsy packhorse, at a loss when faced with essence and phenomenon, cause and effect." But Lei Haizong said that this "clumsy packhorse" showed a miracle of rapid progress when it was dying, isn't it a myth?

Xiang Da attacked by raising the issue of history only blooming with five flowers. The five flowers he referred to are the issue of periodization of Chinese history, the issue of capitalist sprouts, the issue of peasant wars, the issue of feudal land ownership, and the issue of the formation of the Han nationality. It should be pointed out that the issue of the five flowers raised by Xiang Da does not conform to the facts. Since liberation, we have focused on discussing these five issues. There is nothing wrong with discussing these five issues, because they are key issues in history. However, in addition to this, we have also raised many new issues in the field of history, including major and minor issues. However, Xiang Da only saw these five issues. In his words, he only saw these "five flowers," and he hated these five flowers the most. Why? The reason is very simple: it is because these five flowers are flowers bloomed by Marxist historical science, and only Marxist historical science can bloom these five flowers. Precisely because of this, Xiang Da was unhappy and spread it everywhere, as if this was the crime of Chinese history since liberation. Xiang Da not only opposed the use of Marxism to study history, but also despised Marxism. When Mr. Tang Yongtong made a postscript to the reprint of his book "History of Buddhism in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties," he mentioned "attempting to point out the shortcomings of this book from the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism." Xiang Da said: "This is lowering one's status." Obviously, in his opinion, only insisting on the bourgeois position and viewpoint is superior.

If Lei Haizong and Xiang Da were standing on the bourgeois position to oppose Marxism, attempting to replace Marxism with comprador and bourgeois historical science, then Rong Mengyuan advocated restorationism, attempting to replace Marxist historical science with mainly feudal historical science. Rong Mengyuan fully exposed his reactionary thinking in the initial draft of his "Suggestions for Compiling Historical Materials Since the Revolution of 1911." In this article, not a single word mentioned Marxism, but instead opposed Marxism in an obscure tone. He said: "Currently, historical materials since the Revolution of 1911, apart from original materials, are mostly papers with narration and commentary intertwined. Papers are of course necessary, but using papers to replace everything hinders the study of historical science." Judging from the context, the papers Rong Mengyuan referred to are papers written from a Marxist perspective. In Rong Mengyuan's view, such papers hinder the development of historical science. He also said: "Annals inherit our country's historical tradition, which should be both straightforward and unhidden, and should also pay attention to calligraphy, that is, pay attention to standpoints, viewpoints, and methods."

We have never opposed annals. We believe that although annals have their shortcomings, they are still one of the excellent traditions in our country's historical material compilation. Therefore, after liberation, we organized and published the "Zizhi Tongjian." However, using the method of annals to arrange historical materials does not exclude the application of new standpoints and viewpoints; conversely, applying new standpoints and viewpoints to study history does not mean that one cannot be "straightforward and unhidden." However, it is not difficult to see that Rong Mengyuan is pitting straightforwardness and unhiddenness against standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, as if standing on the proletariat's position and applying the Marxist viewpoint and method to study history means that one cannot be straightforward and unhidden. This is a malicious slander against Marxist historical science. After attacking Marxism, Rong Mengyuan put forward suggestions for compiling various historical books that do not use Marxism or are anti-Marxist. Acting according to Rong Mengyuan's suggestions would inevitably lead Chinese history back to the old path of feudalism.

Despite the fact that the rightists described bourgeois and even feudal landlord class history in rose-colored terms, it is impossible to pull Chinese history backward, because the time is too late. Marx said: "The same thing is a finished product for one century, but for another century, it is only a raw material used for new production." Bourgeois and even feudal landlord class history both have their own centuries, and their centuries have passed. Therefore, even if there are some useful parts in them, they can only be used as raw materials for Marxist historical science.

Second, bourgeois rightists and some people with serious rightist ideas not only oppose Marxism, but also launch vicious attacks on the leadership of the Communist Party. Xiang Da, Lei Haizong, Rong Mengyuan, and others are all like this. Xiang Da made a lot of attacks on the Party's leadership in the Academy of Sciences in many meetings. He said that the leadership of the Academy of Sciences is laymen leading professionals. Some administrative leading Party member cadres are laymen who "don't understand the business at all." He said that the Party's leadership in the Academy of Sciences is "like Zhang Zongchang leading troops," comparing the Communist Party to the Northern Warlords. Xiang Da often threw his official hat on the ground, which means he wanted to protest to the laymen. Xiang Da himself opposed the leadership of the Communist Party, thinking that others also opposed the leadership of the Communist Party like him. What he called laymen is the Communist Party. Xiang Da also acted like a master, calling for this one to step down and that one to step down. As a first-level professor at Peking University, the director of the library, and a member of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Academy of Sciences, and the deputy director of the Second Institute of History, he did not regard these as the extraordinary glory given to him by the people, but instead slandered the Party for being "both laymen and distrustful of people." He viciously slandered the Party for having the idea of "those who are not of my race must have different hearts" towards non-Party members, saying that "the Academy of Sciences is a big beehive of sectarianism." He arbitrarily provoked by saying that the Party regarded scientists as "street vagrants," "coming when called and leaving when waved away." He threatened: "What do you think of us scientists? We are being bullied, and I want to sue."

Lei Haizong also fired poisonous arrows at the Party's leadership. He slandered that "Chinese intellectuals can be ranked first in the world in the history of the ability to remain silent." He said that after liberation, intellectuals "generally remain silent, or can only hope that they will utter a set of false words." Everyone please note that what Lei Haizong said after liberation were all "false words," not a single "truth." Everyone knows that the most basic requirement of history is authenticity. How can a person who says false words against his will give students correct historical knowledge? We hope that he will speak the truth in his heart. Lei Haizong also talked about not letting the Party "issue orders" in his article, and threatened that otherwise, intellectuals would tell lies or "not be in their position, not seek their politics" and passively resist.

Rong Mengyuan was also extremely hostile to our criticism of bourgeois ideology. In the aforementioned article, he distorted and fabricated some words said by Party members, and then attacked by saying, "I think this statement is very ignorant, but I can only slander in my heart, not dare to say it out loud. Slandering in my heart should be beheaded, but if I don't express it, others won't know, what can I do." He simply regarded Communist Party members as feudal autocratic monarchs, and the depth of his hatred can be imagined.

All of these show that rightists and people with rightist ideas are all hiding under the banner of anti-sectarianism, shouting the slogan that laymen cannot lead professionals, in order to oppose the Communist Party's leadership over social sciences, so as to realize the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance to abolish the scientific locomotive in the anti-socialist scientific program.

Third, another common characteristic of rightists and people with rightist ideas is that they are all looking for the shortcomings of the Communist Party everywhere during the day with lanterns, while pretending not to see or not wanting to see the rapid development of historical science under the leadership of the Party since liberation. They describe historical science after liberation as pitch black. Xiang Da said: "The reason why the historical circle is now dying is inseparable from Fan Wenlan's sectarianism." He also said: "People in the historical circle have been in low spirits in the past few years." He asked with his eyes closed: "The historical circle has not been doing well since liberation, should the people in the Party responsible for it be held responsible?" May I ask Xiang Da, where did you see that the current historical circle is "dying" and "in low spirits"? And where did you see that it is inseparable from Fan Wenlan's sectarianism? Taking research institutions as an example, before liberation, there was only one Institute of History and Philology. After liberation, there are three Institutes of History, one Institute of Archeology, and one Institute of Linguistics. Why is it instead dying? Taking universities as an example, before the adjustment of departments, the Department of History of Peking University only had 159 students. Now there are more than 500 students, as well as 11 international students and 41 foreign students. Why is it instead in low spirits?

Lei Haizong also behaved very badly in this regard. He spread a lot of poison to the students. He said that the books published after liberation "have nothing to read," and said that these books "have poor content and chaotic logic." He even viciously slandered: "The worst books before liberation are better than the current ones." "The books published after liberation have no academic value, and reading them makes the brain stiff. From a professional point of view, one should read more books published before liberation," and so on.

The purpose of all these fallacies is to deny our achievements in historical science, deny the superiority of the socialist system, and find reasons for the restoration of bourgeois historical science.

Fourth, another common characteristic of rightists and people with rightist ideas is that they all have strong personal ambitions. Xiang Da, Wang Zhonghan, Rong Mengyuan, and others are all like this, but they each feel that the size of their "capital" is different, so their ambitions vary. Xiang Da attached great importance to personal power. When he served as the director of the library of Peking University, he turned the library into an independent small kingdom. When he served as the deputy director of the Second Institute of History, he paid close attention to whether he was the first deputy director or the second deputy director. He often became emotional when his personal power desires were not met. He mistakenly believed that the Communist Party was tough and not soft, and that the Communist Party was weak and could be deceived. He repeatedly said that he did not want to be an official, and that others were all officials. Recently, in order to satisfy his personal ambitions, Xiang Da even disregarded the interests of the 700,000 Miao and Tujia people in western Hunan, and colluded with rightist Pan Guangdan and a few rightist elements among the Tujia people in western Hunan, and carried out many anti-Party activities. According to the revealed materials, they carried out a series of activities to provoke and split relations between the Miao and Tujia people, internal relations among the Tujia people, relations between the Tujia people and the Party, relations between the province and the Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and relations between the central government and local governments. According to the exposure of comrades from the Hunan Nationalities Committee, a small group of rightists among the Tujia people in western Hunan had already discussed with Xiang Da and asked him to be the head of their autonomous prefecture for the separate autonomy of the Tujia people in their conspiracy. They also conspired to expand their power and establish autonomous regions spanning several provinces. Needless to say, if this conspiracy succeeds, Xiang Da can be the chairman of this ideal autonomous region. Rong Mengyuan's ambition seems to be to be the director of a "History Museum of the Republic of China." Professor Wang Zhonghan, a rightist from the Department of History of the Nationalities Institute, conspired to organize a joint association of various democratic parties, attempting to seize the leadership of the entire school in the name of "supervising rectification and guaranteeing free airing of views."

All of these show that the rightists are all taking advantage of the fire to rob, attempting to seize the leadership of the social sciences, and some rightists have even developed to seizing political leadership.

The rightists may say that the fallacies they published are academic research issues, and academic research belongs to the scope of the Hundred Schools of Thought. Doesn't the Communist Party want to continue to implement the policy of the Hundred Schools of Thought? Yes, the Communist Party wants to implement and will continue to implement the policy of the Hundred Schools of Thought, and we firmly support this policy. Differences in academic opinions can be freely debated, and we can continue to have major debates and disputes, as it has been in the past and will continue to be in the future. But just as President Guo Moruo said, "Academic research is one thing, and carrying out anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities under the guise of academic research is another. There is a clear line between the two, and this line must not be confused." The activities carried out by the rightists and people with rightist ideas in the historical field are not academic activities in essence, but a part of the anti-Party and anti-socialist political conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance. It is not a dispute between materialism and idealism in academics, but to fundamentally change the direction of historical science and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism.

The above are not all the situations in the historical field. In this reactionary wave, many rightists and people with rightist ideas have also emerged in universities and historical research institutions across the country. In view of this, I believe that our historical field should launch a national-scale anti-rightist struggle to further expose and criticize the rightists and rightist remarks in the historical field. This is necessary for the development of historical science and the defense of socialism. We must hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, launch a firm and merciless counterattack against the rightists, eliminate the negative influences they have left in history, and smash their reactionary conspiracy to change the direction of history and seize the leadership of history.
