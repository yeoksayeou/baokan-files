Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: After the Construction Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machine Building entered the third stage of rectification, activists among Party members and the masses took the lead in posting big-character posters criticizing the "three isms" existing among leaders, and a surge of extensive airing of views has appeared within the bureau.

    After the basic conclusion of the anti-Rightist struggle, the bureau held forums separately for Party members and non-Party members to solicit opinions on entering the third stage of rectification, and repeatedly carried out mobilization. In particular, education was conducted among leading cadres, encouraging them to be determined to undertake major rectification and changes, and not to be afraid of "getting burned." Those who had expressed some erroneous opinions in the early stages of the movement and were therefore somewhat apprehensive were educated through group meetings, individual talks, and other means to relieve them of their ideological burdens. At the same time, the bureau's leadership also strengthened and adjusted the organization responsible for leading the rectification. After completing this series of preparatory work, a general meeting of all staff was convened, formally announcing the basic conclusion of the anti-Rightist struggle, the beginning of the third stage of rectification, and calling on everyone to extensively air their views and actively help the Communist Party in its rectification.

    Since the beginning of the airing of views, mainly in the form of big-character posters, on the 7th of this month, activists in the anti-Rightist struggle have taken the lead in posting many big-character posters, and the masses have also joined the movement, actively airing their views. As of the morning of the 18th, according to statistics, 75 people in the bureau had posted 135 big-character posters. Among the criticisms and suggestions put forward in the big-character posters, 48% belonged to working systems and business management, 18% belonged to leadership style and general cadre style, and 7% belonged to basic construction guidelines and systems. Many of these opinions raised some fundamental issues of the bureau. One big-character poster criticized the problem of actual investment in basic construction exceeding the budgeted investment, and the critic analyzed the causes of this phenomenon from five aspects and put forward six improvement suggestions. Some big-character posters suggested that the summary of the bureau's first five-year plan for basic construction should be combined with the summary of design technology in order to further improve the design level. The bureau's leadership has attached great importance to these criticisms and suggestions, and has designated relevant business departments to start research and prepare to organize the masses for further discussion. At present, the bureau's extensive airing of views has created a surge, and the masses are in high spirits, with some people even rushing to write big-character posters at night.

    During this period, the bureau's various departments also held some forums to conduct airing of views, and more than 200 opinions were put forward in the forums.

    In order to seriously handle the opinions put forward by the masses and resolutely do a good job in rectification and reform, the bureau's leadership has designated someone to copy the opinions put forward in the big-character posters every day, and then comprehensively classify and study them in batches. Problems that can be solved are immediately solved, and the handling situation is announced once a week. In the first batch of handling results announced, a total of 22 opinions were explained and answered to the masses. For example, one big-character poster criticized the leadership for not paying close attention to the 20 standards for factory design being compiled and put forward three improvement suggestions. After research, the bureau's leadership accepted all of these opinions. According to the three suggestions put forward by the critic, people have been sent to relevant design institutes to check this work, and two cadres have been designated to be responsible for organizing and guiding the compilation of these 20 standards, and two more process technicians have been added to participate in this work. Another example is that two big-character posters suggested establishing a system of regular work summaries and regular employee forums. The bureau's leadership believes that this opinion is feasible and has decided to resume quarterly work summaries and hold employee forums in conjunction with the summary work to solicit opinions and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Because the bureau can rectify and reform while airing views, using actions to show its determination to resolutely rectify and reform, this has encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to extensively air their views and promoted the development of the movement.

    领导大整大改  群众大鸣大放
    新华社19日讯  第二机械工业部基本建设局转入整风第三阶段后，党员和群众中的积极分子带头张贴大字报，批评领导上存在的“三个主义”，局内已出现大鸣大放的热潮。
    在反右派斗争基本结束后，这个局在党内、党外分别召开了座谈会，征求对转入整风第三阶段的意见，并且反复进行动员。特别在领导干部中进行了教育，鼓励他们下决心大整大改，不怕“引火烧身”。对在运动初期发表过一些错误言论、因而有些顾虑的人，先后通过小组会、个别谈话等方式进行教育，使他们卸掉了思想包袱。同时，局的领导方面又加强和调整了领导整风的办事机构。在完成了这一系列的准备工作之后，接着召开了全局工作人员大会，正式宣布反右派斗争基本结束，整风第三阶段开始，号召大家大鸣大放，积极帮助共产党整风。
    从本月7日起，这个局以大字报为主要形式的鸣放一开始，反右派斗争中的积极分子便带头张贴出很多大字报，群众也随即参加了运动，积极鸣放。截至18日上午的统计，全局有七十五人贴出了一百三十五张大字报。大字报上所提出的批评建议，属于工作制度和业务管理方面的占48％，属于领导作风和一般干部作风的占18％，属于基本建设方针和体制的占7％。其中有不少意见提出了这个局的带有一些根本性的问题。有一张大字报上对基本建设的实际投资超过预算投资问题提出了批评，批评者从五个方面分析了产生这种现象的原因，并提出了六项改进建议。有的大字报上建议通过这个局的第一个五年计划的基本建设总结，结合进行设计技术的总结，以便进一步提高设计水平。局的领导上对这些批评和建议都很重视，已指定有关业务部门着手研究，准备组织群众进一步展开讨论。目前，这个局的大鸣大放已经造成热潮，群众情绪很高，有的人晚上还赶写大字报。
    在这个期间，这个局的各科室还召开了一些座谈会进行鸣放，在座谈中提出的意见有二百多条。
    为了认真地处理群众提出的意见，坚决做好整改工作，这个局的领导方面每天都指定专人抄录大字报上提出的意见，然后综合分类、分批研究，有条件解决的问题立即进行解决，并且每星期公布一次处理的情形。在公布的第一批处理结果中，共向群众交代、答复了二十二条意见，如其中有一张批评领导上对正在编制的工厂设计二十项标准抓得不紧、并提出三点改进建议的大字报，局的领导方面经过研究后全部接受了这些意见，根据批评者提出的三点建议，已经派人到有关设计院检查这一工作，同时指定了两个干部负责组织、指导这二十项标准的编制工作，而且还增加了两个工艺技术人员参加这一工作。又如有两张大字报建议订立定期总结工作的制度和定期召开职工座谈会。局的领导方面认为这个意见可行，已决定恢复季度工作总结，并结合总结工作召开职工座谈会，征求意见，开展批评和自我批评。由于这个局能够边鸣放边整改，用行动表明坚决整改的决心，这就鼓舞了群众大鸣大放的热情，推动了运动的发展。
