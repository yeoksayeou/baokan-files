    Three Years of Hard Struggle to Conquer the Lowlands
    Tianjin Prefecture Transformed from Grain-Deficient to Grain-Surplus Area
    Many Agricultural Cooperative Members' Production Levels Catch Up with or Exceed Those of Rich Middle Peasants
    (Report from our newspaper) Relying on the masses to transform low-lying areas has brought a great victory to Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province. In just three short years, the entire prefecture has been transformed from a grain-deficient area into a grain-surplus area.
    Tianjin Prefecture has more than 13 million mu of cultivated land, of which low-lying areas account for 70%. These low-lying areas are divided into ninety-two depressions by forty-two major rivers of the Hai River, Chaobai River, and other water systems, including three million mu that are perennially waterlogged. Every summer, floods surge and fail to drain properly, leading to inundation and disaster. Three years ago, an average of five million mu of land in the region was affected by waterlogging each year. After each disaster, the state had to transfer 400 to 500 million jin of grain from other regions and allocate 4 to 5 million yuan in relief funds to support the masses in overcoming famine. Year after year, the disasters brought severe poverty to the people.
    The Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China deeply felt the need to find new methods to lead the masses in overcoming waterlogging and gradually escaping poverty. After the 1954 flood, the Party and government leadership of Tianjin Prefecture, while providing disaster relief, also selected more than 1,000 cadres. Led by the Party committee, they went deep among the masses and conducted three months of investigation and research. In their investigations, they interviewed tens of thousands of farmers and discovered the masses' rich experience in turning water hazards into water resources through various methods. The leading organs summarized these experiences and formulated the principle of "utilizing nature, transforming nature, and turning water disasters into water resources" for transforming low-lying areas. Based on this principle, comprehensive plans were made at the prefecture, county, and township levels to mobilize the masses to actively participate in this struggle to transform nature. Thus, the transformation of low-lying areas became a mass movement involving "thousands of troops and horses." Starting in 1955, every year for three years, 150,000 to 160,000 men and women laborers (not including flood control and river dredging workers) have been engaged in water conservancy projects. All projects were mainly built by relying on the masses' own manpower, materials, and financial resources. This year's more than 11,000 sluice gates and culverts were built with bricks and tiles fired by the masses themselves, stones collected by the masses themselves, and very little wood purchased. Therefore, the cost of the project was very low, with a direct state investment of only 2.8 jiao per mu.
    Water conservancy construction is the fundamental problem in transforming low-lying areas. Over the past three years, the treatment of water in low-lying areas has developed from partial management to comprehensive management of low-lying areas, flatlands, and highlands, and from the past simple "prevention" and "discharge" to a complete system that combines prevention and utilization, with utilization as the main focus. In the past three years, more than 20,000 water intake and drainage sluices, culverts, and gates, and more than 50 million cubic meters of earthwork for canals and embankments, as well as more than 4 million mu of terraced fields with earthen ridges have been completed. Having withstood the test of severe floods in the past two years, more than 90% of the projects have played a role in resisting disasters and ensuring harvests. In the development of water conservancy work, different treatment methods were adopted for different low-lying areas. After three years of hard work, five million mu of low-lying areas have been initially transformed.
    The development of water conservancy has guaranteed the reform of the farming system. High-yielding crops resistant to waterlogging, such as rice, have been widely promoted in low-lying areas. This year, nearly one million mu of rice were planted, with an average yield of 400 to 500 jin per mu, two to three times higher than other crops. In addition, the natural conditions of low-lying areas have been used to develop other crops such as reeds, cattails, and jute, as well as aquatic products. Beihuaidian Township in Ninghe County used to be a barren depression that was flooded, with summer and autumn floods and spring and autumn alkaline water damage. Of the township's more than 140,000 mu of land, only 10,000 mu were cultivated, and even those often yielded no harvest. Farmers were forced to rely on grass-cutting and locust-catching for a living. After the transformation of low-lying areas began, two small reservoirs for storing and utilizing tidal water, seven larger grass gates, and flood control projects protecting more than 10,000 mu of land were built. This year, the township's more than 8,000 mu of rice fields yielded a good harvest. Jiaodaowa in Wuqing County used to be flooded whenever it rained. In 1956, earthen embankments were built, and although there was a heavy rain in June, no flooding occurred. Although the Yongding River breached its banks upstream in August and floodwaters poured into Jiaodaowa, the earthen embankment projects built by the masses ensured the harvest of 35,000 mu of cultivated land, producing 13.4 million jin of grain, an increase of 1.6 million jin compared to the relatively good harvest of the entire depression in 1955.
    The victory in the transformation of low-lying areas has been enthusiastically praised by the vast number of farmers. For example, after the transformation of perennially waterlogged areas, the following song spread among the farmers: "Fishing in January and February, lotus roots in March and April, cattails in May and June, harvesting wheat and water chestnuts in July, great autumn harvest in September and October, reeds in November, and fisheries rise again in December: production all year round, harvests every month!" In areas prone to flooding and waterlogging, farmers praised the transformation of low-lying areas as "a good magic weapon for no flooding in heavy rain, no drought in light rain, and more grain production."
    The leap forward in production has greatly changed the impoverished face of low-lying areas. First, the speed of grain production has increased rapidly. The 2 million mu of low-lying areas transformed in 1955 produced 480 million jin of grain, the 4 million mu transformed in 1956 produced 660 million jin, and the low-lying areas transformed this year are expected to produce 880 million jin. Together with the output of general areas, this year's total grain output is 1.64 billion jin, which is not only enough to eat and use but also allows for the transfer of tens of millions of jin to other areas. In addition, nearly 400 million jin of reeds, cattails, etc., 54 million jin of hemp, and more than 200 million jin of fish, shrimp, and crabs were produced in the three years. In the past, rich middle peasants in low-lying areas produced an average of 500 to 560 jin of grain per person in good years. Now, according to a survey of 147 agricultural cooperatives, cooperatives with an average grain output of 1,400 to 2,200 jin per person account for 15%, those with 1,000 to 1,400 jin account for 27.2%, and even the cooperatives with the lowest output have an average of 500 to 1,000 jin per person. The great achievements of the cooperatives in transforming nature have strengthened the masses' confidence in taking the socialist road. Farmers said, "The transformation of low-lying areas is the second liberation." A few rich middle peasants who were originally wavering said, "Now, even if you carry me out of the cooperative in a sedan chair carried by eight people, I won't leave!"

    苦战三年　征服洼地
    天津专区由缺粮区变为余粮区
    许多农业社员生产水平赶上或超过富裕中农
    本报讯　河北省天津专区依靠群众改造低洼地获得巨大胜利，在短短的三年中间，全专区已由缺粮区变成余粮区。
    天津专区共有一千三百多万亩耕地，洼地占了70％。这些洼地被海河、潮白河等水系的四十二条大河流分割成九十二个洼淀，其中有三百万亩常年积水。每逢夏季，洪水暴涨，宣泄不畅，遂致泛滥成灾。三年前，全区平均每年有五百万亩土地受涝灾。每年灾后国家要从外区调入粮食四、五亿斤，拨出救济款四、五百万元，支持群众渡荒。年复一年的灾害给人民带来了严重的贫困。
    中共天津地委深切地感到，必须寻找新的方法，领导群众战胜涝灾，逐步摆脱贫困状态。1954年发生水灾以后，天津专区的党政领导机关，一面救灾，一面抽出一千多个干部，他们由党委带领，深入群众，进行了三个月的调查研究。他们在调查中，访问了上万个农民，发现了群众利用多种办法变水害为水利的丰富经验。领导机关总结了这些经验，制订了“利用自然，改造自然，变水患为水利”的改造洼地的方针。根据这个方针，专、县、乡逐级进行了全面规划，发动群众积极参加这一改造自然的斗争。于是，改造洼地就形成一个“千军万马”的群众运动。从1955年开始，三年来每年都有十五、六万男女劳动力（不算防汛、挖河工人）从事水利工程。全部工程主要是依靠群众自己的人力、物力、财力建筑起来的。今年所建的一万一千多座闸涵斗门，砖瓦是群众自己烧的，石料是群众自己凑集的，木料买的很少。因此，工程的成本很低，国家每亩直接投资仅仅两角八分。
    兴修水利是改造洼地的根本问题。三年来，洼地的治水，由局部的治理发展到洼地、平地、高地全面治理，由过去的单纯的“防”和“泄”，发展到防用结合以用为主的完整体系。三年中共完成进水、排水的闸、涵、斗门两万多座，渠道、围埝等土方工程五千多万公方，土埂畦田四百多万亩。经过过去两年严重水灾的考验，90％以上的工程都发挥了抗灾保收的作用。在发展水利工作中，对于不同的洼地，采取了不同的治理方法。经过三年来的艰苦努力，已经初步改造好五百万亩洼地。
    水利的发展，保证了耕作制度的改革。在低洼地区大量推广了保收高产的农作物——水稻。今年种水稻近百万亩，一般每亩产四、五百斤，比别的作物产量高两、三倍。另外，还利用低洼地区的自然条件，大量发展其他作物如苇、蒲、黄麻等和水产品。宁河县北淮淀乡，过去是过洪水的荒洼，夏秋洪水泛滥，春秋碱水为害，全乡十四万多亩土地，耕种的只有一万亩，还常年不收。农民被迫依靠打草、捕蝗为生。洼地改造工作开始以后，兴修了两座蓄用潮水的小水库、七座较大的草闸和保护一万多亩地的防涝工程。今年全乡种的八千多亩稻子得到了好收成。武清县夹道洼往年遇雨就涝，1956年修了土埂，6月间遇到一次暴雨，却没有发生涝灾；8月间虽然由于永定河上游决口，洪水灌入夹道洼，但是由于群众兴修的土埂工程却保证了三万五千亩耕地的收成，生产粮食一千三百四十万斤，比收成较好的1955年的全洼粮食产量还增加一百六十万斤。
    洼地改造的胜利，受到广大农民的热情赞扬。如常年积水的洼地改造后，在农民中流传开这样的歌谣：“一二月治鱼三四月藕，五六月打蒲，七月拔麦收菱角，九十两月过大秋，十一月，正打苇，十二月渔业又抬头：全年有生产，月月有秋收！”在易涝过水的地区，农民称赞洼地改造“是大雨下不涝，小雨旱不了，多打粮食的好法宝”。
    生产的跃进，使得低洼地区的贫困面貌大大改变了。首先，粮食增产的速度快。1955年改造的二百万亩洼地产了粮食四亿八千万斤，1956年改造的四百万亩地产了六亿六千万斤，今年改造的洼地可产八亿八千万斤，加上一般地区的产量，今年共产粮食十六亿四千万斤，不仅够吃够用，还可外调几千万斤。此外，三年中还生产了苇、蒲等近四亿斤，麻五千四百万斤，鱼虾蟹二亿多斤。过去低洼地区的富裕中农在好年头每人平均产粮五百斤到五百六十斤，现在，据一百四十七个农业社的调查，每人平均产粮一千四百斤至二千二百斤的社占15％，一千斤至一千四百斤的社占27.2％，其他社产量最少的，每人平均也有五百斤至一千斤。合作社改造自然的伟大成就，坚定了群众走社会主义道路的信心。农民说：“洼地改造是第二次翻身。”原来动摇的少数富裕中农说：“现在八抬轿抬我也不出社了！”
