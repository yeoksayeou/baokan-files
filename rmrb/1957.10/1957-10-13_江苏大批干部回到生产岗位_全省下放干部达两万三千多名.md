　　Jiangsu Sends Large Numbers of Cadres Back to Production Posts
　　More Than 23,000 Cadres Transferred Downward Throughout the Province

　　(Our Dispatch) Since this spring, leadership organs at all levels in Jiangsu Province have transferred downward more than 23,000 cadres, many of whom have returned to production posts. According to incomplete statistics from only 24 counties and cities, there are more than 8,100 people.
　　Cadres who have returned to production posts are able to actively engage in physical labor and motivate the masses to actively engage in production. Ge Yushun, a former cadre of Xibu Township in Yancheng County, after returning to the agricultural cooperative, formulated a family production and savings plan, worked hard in production, and has already accumulated 110 workdays. He also serves as a cooperative cadre and works actively. Young intellectual cadres in Jiangning County who have returned home to engage in production have expressed their determination to win victories on the production front and strive to become labor models. Huang Baochang, a production and construction assistant in Baihe District, Qingpu County, after returning to his production post, actively engaged in production and also served as the deputy director of the cooperative. During drainage and rescue operations, he mobilized cooperative members to support fraternal cooperatives. When a few cooperative members wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, he patiently persuaded and educated them, which was appreciated by the cooperative members. Cadres from the Jin Tan County Agricultural and Forestry Bureau who returned to their hometowns to engage in production have all expressed their desire to dedicate their skills to the new socialist countryside.
　　Farmers in various places warmly welcomed the cadres who returned to their hometowns to engage in production. Feng County, Jiading County, and other counties also held grand meetings to welcome cadres who returned to their hometowns to engage in production. Upon hearing that a cadre from a supply and marketing cooperative was coming to their village to participate in production, they wrote him a letter saying, "Please come back quickly, we have even arranged what work you will do." Tang Meibing from Xinzha Township, Wujin County, upon seeing her relative Tang Meiqing return to the cooperative to engage in production, said, "Our Meiqing is back, adding another labor force, so we don't have to worry about production anymore."
　　After the cadres were transferred downward, the leadership of grassroots organizations was strengthened. Half of the 300 or so township party secretaries in the 120 townships of Songjiang Prefecture were originally members of the county party committee or heads and deputy heads of county party departments. Among the 71 counties in the province, the county party secretaries of 67 counties have been strengthened. Among these county party secretaries are 120 provincial party committee members, provincial party committee department heads, provincial people's committee department heads, and division chiefs from provincial-level organs. Due to the strengthening of the leadership of grassroots organizations, the party's policies can also be implemented more quickly and correctly among the masses. Many places reported that in the past, it would take at least five or six days to complete a task from the county to the cooperative, but now three days are enough. Grassroots cadres said, "In the past, work assignments were timely at the county level, out of sync at the township level, and outdated when they reached the masses; now, work assignments are timely at the county level, appropriate at the township level, and just right when they reach the masses."

　　江苏大批干部回到生产岗位
    全省下放干部达两万三千多名
    本报讯　从今春以来，江苏省各级领导机关已下放干部二万三千余人，其中很多人都回到了生产岗位。仅据二十四个县、市的不完全统计，就有八千一百余人。
    回到生产岗位的干部，都能积极的从事体力劳动，并带动群众积极从事生产。盐城县原西堡乡干部葛余顺，回到农业社后，制订了家庭生产节约计划，努力参加生产，本人已做了一百一十个劳动日，他还担任了社的干部，积极工作。江宁县回家生产的青年知识分子干部，纷纷表示决心，要在生产战线上打胜仗，争取做劳动模范。青浦县白鹤区生产建设助理黄宝昌回到生产岗位之后，积极生产，又担任副社长，在排捞抢救中发动社员支持兄弟社；当有少数社员要退社时，就对他们进行耐心的说服教育工作，受到社员爱戴。金坛县农林局回乡生产的干部，都表示要把自己的技术献给社会主义新农村。
    各地农民都热烈欢迎回乡生产的干部。丰县、嘉定等县还开了大会欢迎干部回乡生产。听说一个供销社的干部要到他们那里参加生产，就给他写信说：“你快点回来吧，我们连给你干什么活都安排好了。”武进县新闸乡汤梅丙，看到自己的亲人汤梅青回社生产就说：“我们梅青回来了，增加了一个劳动力，以后生产别怕了。”
    干部下放之后，加强了基层组织的领导。松江专区一百二十个乡的三百多个乡委书记，一半是由原来的县委委员或县委正副部长担任的。全省七十一个县中，有六十七个县委书记得到了加强。这些县委书记中有省委委员、省委部长、省人民委员会厅长和省级机关处长一百二十名。由于基层组织领导力量的加强，党的政策也能比较迅速正确地贯彻到群众中去。许多地方反映说：过去一件工作从县到社起码要五、六天的时间，现在三天就够了。基层干部说：“过去布置工作是县及时，乡脱时，到群众已过时；现在布置工作是县及时，乡适时，到群众正当其时。”　　　（冯俊）
