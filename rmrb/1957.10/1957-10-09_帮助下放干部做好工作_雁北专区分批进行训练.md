    Helping Lower-Level Cadres Do a Good Job
    Yanbei Special District Conducts Training in Batches

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Yanbei area of Shanxi Province recently conducted centralized training in batches for cadres transferred from the special district and county-level agencies to the countryside.

    Since February, the leading agencies of the Yanbei area special district and counties have successively transferred more than 800 cadres to work in the countryside. Most of the transferred cadres are working actively, but some have unsettling thoughts, and some feel that the work is difficult because of a lack of practical experience. Therefore, the Yanbei District Committee of the Communist Party of China began centralized training in batches in June. During the training, these cadres clarified their confused ideas about cooperation, the unified purchase and sale of grain, and urban-rural relations through study, airing opinions, and debate, and criticized certain erroneous ideas and attitudes that belittled rural construction and were not content with their work. The District Committee also particularly emphasized that the transferred cadres should conduct investigations and research to find out the direction of development in their respective villages in order to promote rural construction. After training, most of the first batch of more than 390 students recognized the great significance of rural construction and expressed their willingness to do a good job in rural work.

    After returning to their villages, the trained cadres immediately showed a new style of work. When they returned to their villages, they no longer carried a large amount of personal luggage, but rather hoes and manure baskets. After arriving in the township, they did not arrange their own trivial matters, but first went to the fields to work, leading in the labor. Many people are also busy investigating and studying the situation and formulating long-term development plans.

    帮助下放干部做好工作
    雁北专区分批进行训练
    据新华社讯　山西雁北地区最近分批集中训练了由专区、县级机关下放到乡村的干部。
    雁北地区专区、县领导机关从2月开始，陆续把八百多个干部下放到乡村工作。下放干部多数工作积极，但也有些干部有不安心思想，有的因为实际经验不足，感到工作棘手。因此，中共雁北地委从6月开始分批集训。在集训中，通过学习、鸣放和争论，澄清了这些干部对合作化、粮食统购统销、城乡关系等问题的糊涂思想，批判了某些轻视农村建设和不安心工作的错误思想和态度。地委还特别强调下放干部要作调查研究，找出所在乡村的发展方向，以便推进农村建设。经过训练，第一批学员三百九十多人大都认识了农村建设的重大意义，表示要安心做好农村工作。
    经过训练的干部回乡后，立即表现出一种新的工作作风。他们回乡时，不再是携带个人的大量行囊包裹，而是带着锄头和粪筐。到乡里以后，不是安排自己的生活琐事，而是首先下田劳动，在劳动中进行领导。还有许多人忙着调查研究情况，制订发展远景规划。
