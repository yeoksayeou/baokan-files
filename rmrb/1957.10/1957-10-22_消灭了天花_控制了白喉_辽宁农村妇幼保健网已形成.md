Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: Rural areas in Liaoning Province now have maternal and child health stations or midwifery stations in every township. Smallpox has been eradicated and diphtheria controlled throughout the province.

The health stations and midwifery stations distributed throughout the province have close organizational and leadership ties with the obstetrics and gynecology departments of comprehensive hospitals, forming a rural health and healthcare network. Each station is equipped with midwives, birth attendants, or trained traditional birth attendants. Except for extremely remote areas, all births in the province are now conducted using modern methods. The neonatal mortality rate in the province has decreased from 3.2% in 1953 to 1.2%; the neonatal tetanus mortality rate has also been greatly reduced.

Disease prevention and healthcare for infants and young children in rural areas have also been greatly strengthened. According to statistics from the Liaoning Provincial Health Department, in 1955 and 1956 alone, ten million doses of vaccines and vaccinia virus, BCG vaccine, diphtheria toxoid, etc., were distributed. The infant and child mortality rate has been greatly reduced. The measles mortality rate has decreased from 3.3% in 1953 to 0.56%; the whooping cough mortality rate has decreased from 0.79% to 0.42%.

People's governments and agricultural cooperatives at all levels in the province have formulated extremely detailed labor protection measures for rural women participating in production, so that the health level and labor enthusiasm of women are increasing day by day. At present, 884 busy farming season nurseries and 9,921 busy farming season childcare groups have been established throughout the province, and 85 kindergartens have been established.
