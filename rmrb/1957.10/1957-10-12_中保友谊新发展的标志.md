The government delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, headed by Chairman Yugov, visited China for more than a month, traveling to many cities and villages, and visiting some of China's major factories, agricultural cooperatives, and cultural and scientific institutions. They conducted a broad and in-depth inspection of the Chinese people's socialist construction. The distinguished guests traveled a long distance to visit us, expressing boundless concern for the Chinese people and leaving a deep impression on the Chinese people. The distinguished guests spoke highly of the achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party in leading the Chinese people in the work of revolution and construction, powerfully inspiring the broad masses of the Chinese people and greatly enhancing our confidence in the cause of socialist construction. We sincerely thank the Bulgarian people for this sentiment brought by the delegation.

During the visit, the leaders of the two governments held talks, and both sides had a completely consistent understanding of the issues discussed.

The most pressing international issues that need to be resolved are disarmament and the prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as all peace-loving countries in the world, have made unremitting efforts to promote the early conclusion of an agreement on these issues through negotiations. However, Western countries such as the United States and Britain have used all kinds of unreasonable obstruction to prevent a reasonable solution to this major issue concerning the fate of all mankind. The joint communiqué of the Chinese and Bulgarian governments condemned this position of the Western countries and firmly stated their full support for the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on relevant issues at the 12th United Nations General Assembly.

The U.S. ruling clique recently crudely interfered in Syria's internal affairs, attempting to use armed aggression to control Syria, thus seriously threatening peace in the Middle East region and the world. In particular, the United States is attempting to drag Turkey, Bulgaria's neighbor, into a war against Syria, which cannot but arouse the vigilance of the Bulgarian people. The Chinese and Bulgarian governments firmly condemn the aggressive policies of the United States and continue to support Syria in its opposition to aggression and the struggle of the people of the Middle East countries for freedom and national independence.

The Balkan Peninsula is an extremely sensitive nerve center in Europe and was formerly known as the "powder keg of Europe." The Bulgarian people, located in this region, have consistently adhered to a policy of good-neighborliness and friendship, striving to turn the Balkans into a powerful factor for peace in Europe. The Chinese government supports this policy of Bulgaria. China and Bulgaria expressed their full agreement with the Romanian government's proposal to convene a high-level conference of Balkan countries to sign a joint agreement guaranteeing peace and prosperous development in the Balkan region.

In the joint statement, the two governments fully supported the repeated proposals of the government of the German Democratic Republic to unify Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country by promoting mutual understanding and rapprochement between the two existing Germanies; supported the desire of the Korean and Vietnamese peoples to peacefully reunify their countries; advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems; advocated replacing all military blocs with collective security and collective peace systems; and condemned the resolution passed by the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States attempting to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. All these propositions are important factors in defending world peace and promoting the further relaxation of the international situation.

The people of China and Bulgaria have learned from their own experience that the assistance of the Soviet Union and the fraternal cooperation of other socialist countries are important conditions for ensuring our peaceful construction and the rapid economic development of our two countries. The imperialists are jealous and hostile to the growing unity and strength of the socialist camp, and they attempt to use all means to alienate and divide us, especially to provoke relations between socialist countries and the Soviet Union. This kind of conspiracy, as the Bulgarian people say, is as futile as "a hungry chicken dreaming of millet." The governments of China and Bulgaria once again stated in the joint statement that they will resolutely continue to consolidate the steel-like unity between the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This also reflects the common aspirations of the 900 million people of socialist countries.

Although China and Bulgaria are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, the ideas of Marxism-Leninism unite us like brothers. The people of both countries are holding high the banner of the October Revolution and marching forward along the road of the October Revolution. In recent years, the cooperative relations between our two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields have developed rapidly. This has played a good role in promoting the development of socialist construction in the two countries and meeting the needs of the people of both countries. This time, the two governments signed an agreement on the exchange of goods and payments for the period of 1958-1960, which is another concrete symbol of the further development of Sino-Bulgarian friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries.

There is a Chinese saying: "The most valuable thing in friendship is knowing each other's hearts." The mutual relations between the countries of our socialist camp are exactly this kind of close friendship. In the past, envoys from China and Bulgaria frequently visited each other, and the people of the two countries have established a deep understanding and friendship. This time, the Bulgarian government delegation headed by Chairman Yugov visited China and had extensive contacts and conversations with representatives from all strata and aspects of our country, which greatly enhanced the mutual understanding between the people of the two countries and laid a deeper foundation for the development of our two countries' friendship.

We wish the Bulgarian government delegation a safe journey home!
We wish the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Bulgaria will continue to be consolidated and developed!

### 中保友谊新发展的标志

　　中保友谊新发展的标志
    以于哥夫主席为首的保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团在中国访问了一个多月，到过许多城市和乡村，参观了我国的一些主要工厂、农业合作社和文化科学机关，对中国人民进行社会主义建设的情况，作了一次广泛、深入的考察。贵宾们不辞跋涉，远道来访，对中国人民表示了无限关怀，给中国人民留下了很深的印象。贵宾们对中国共产党领导中国人民在革命和建设工作中所取得的成绩，给予很高的评价，有力地鼓舞着我国的广大人民群众，大大增强了我们对于社会主义建设事业的信心。我们衷心地感谢代表团带来的保加利亚人民的这种感情。
    在访问期间，两国政府领导人曾进行了会谈，双方对所讨论的问题具有完全一致的认识。
    当前最迫切需要解决的国际问题，是裁军和禁止使用原子武器和氢武器问题。苏联和各社会主义国家以及世界上一切爱好和平的国家，为促使这些问题的谈判能够早日达成协议，曾经作了不懈的努力。但是，美英等西方国家，却百般无理阻挠，使这一关系到全人类命运的重大问题，未能合理解决。中保两国政府的联合声明，谴责了西方国家的这种立场，并坚决表示，完全支持苏联在第十二届联合国大会上就有关问题所提出的建议。
    美国统治集团最近粗暴地干涉叙利亚内政，企图用武装侵略控制叙利亚，因而严重地威胁着中近东地区和全世界的和平。特别是，美国正企图把保加利亚的邻邦土耳其拖入反对叙利亚的战争，这更不能不引起保加利亚人民的警惕。中保两国政府坚决谴责美国的侵略政策，并且继续支持叙利亚反对侵略，支持中近东各国人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争。
    巴尔干半岛是欧洲异常敏感的神经中枢地带，从前被人称为“欧洲火药库”。处在这个地带的保加利亚人民，一贯坚持睦邻友好政策，努力把巴尔干变为欧洲和平的有力因素。中国政府支持保加利亚的这种政策。中保两国并表示完全同意罗马尼亚政府的倡议：召开巴尔干国家最高级会议，签订一项保证巴尔干地区和平和繁荣进步的共同协定。
    在联合声明中，两国政府完全支持德意志民主共和国政府一再提出的建议，通过促使现存的两个德国相互了解和接近的办法，把德国统一为一个爱好和平的民主国家；支持朝鲜和越南人民要求和平统一自己的祖国的愿望；主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处；主张用集体安全和集体和平体系来代替一切军事集团；指责联合国在美国操纵下通过的企图干涉匈牙利内政的决议。所有这些主张，都是保卫世界和平、促进国际形势进一步缓和的重要因素。
    中保两国人民从自己的切身经验中体会到，苏联的援助和其它社会主义国家兄弟般的合作，是保证我们和平建设、保证我们两国经济迅速发展的重要条件。帝国主义者妒忌和仇视社会主义阵营日益增长的团结和强大，他们企图用一切手段来离间和分裂我们，特别是挑拨社会主义国家和苏联之间的关系。这种阴谋诡计，正如保加利亚人民所说的，像“饿食鸡梦小米”一样枉费心机。中保两国政府在联合声明中再一次表示，将坚决地继续巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国间钢铁般的团结。这也反映了社会主义各国九亿人民的共同愿望。
    中保两国虽然隔着千山万水，但马克思列宁主义思想把我们像亲兄弟一样联结起来。两国人民都高举着十月革命的旗帜，循着十月革命的道路向前迈进。近年来，我们两国之间的政治、经济和文化各方面的合作关系，获得了迅速的发展。这对促进两国社会主义建设事业的发展和满足两国人民的需要，起了良好的作用。这一次，两国政府又签订了1958年—1960年期间交换货物和付款的协定，这又是中保友谊和两国互助合作进一步发展的具体标志。
    中国古人有句话：“人之相知，贵相知心”。我们社会主义阵营各国的相互关系，正是这种知心之交。过去，中保两国使节频繁来往，两国人民相互间已经建立起很深的了解和友谊。这一次，以于哥夫主席为首的保加利亚政府代表团访问中国，和我国各阶层、各方面的代表人物进行了广泛的接触和交谈，大大增进了两国人民的相互了解，为我们两国友谊的发展打下了更加深厚的基础。
    祝保加利亚政府代表团在归国途中一路平安！
    祝中保两国人民的兄弟友谊不断巩固和发展！
