    Cable Across the River
    China's largest river-crossing cable to date, the Wuhan Qing (shan) Chen (jiaji) river-crossing cable, was fully laid and completed at the end of September. This cable weighs 43 kilograms per meter, with a total weight of 120 tons; it is 2,750 meters long; and its power transmission capacity can supply a city of 1.5 million people.
    Since the Qingshan Thermal Power Plant began generating electricity, Wuhan's power generation capacity has increased by about 60% compared to before. However, due to the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, the strong current cannot be smoothly delivered to Hankou and Hanyang. After the completion of this 35,000-volt river-crossing cable, the power supply in the Hankou and Hanyang areas will increase dramatically. (Xiao Ding) (Attached picture)

    电缆过江
    我国目前最大的一条过江电缆——武汉青（山）谌（家矶）过江电缆在9月底全部敷设竣工。这条电缆每公尺重四十三公斤，总重量达一百二十吨；全长二千七百五十公尺；输电量可供一百五十万人口的城市使用。
    自从青山热电厂发电以后，武汉的发电容量比原来增加了60％左右。但是由于长江天堑阻隔，强大的电流不能通畅地送到汉口和汉阳。这条三万五千伏特的过江电缆，敷设完工以后，汉口汉阳地区供电量将激剧增加。　（肖定）（附图片）
