	Jilin's Great Debate in the Countryside Yields Great Results
	Those who wanted to withdraw from the cooperatives didn't, individual households requested to join, those claiming grain shortages sold surplus grain, the attendance rate of members greatly increased, and cadres who wanted to quit became active again.

	According to the Jilin Daily, the first batch of agricultural cooperatives in Jilin Province concluded their mass airing of views, great debates around late September. According to statistics from 47 cities and counties, a total of 2,747 agricultural cooperatives (more than 40% of the total number of cooperatives) conducted mass airing of views and great debates.

	Judging from the situation of the first batch of great debates that have already concluded in various regions, the movement is basically healthy. During the great debates, the broad masses actively debated issues such as the unified purchase and sale of grain and other agricultural products, and whether collectivization had advantages; they also raised many opinions on the operational management and cadre style of agricultural cooperatives. The majority of poor and lower-middle peasants, as well as some well-to-do middle peasants, used their personal experiences, using methods such as accounting, recollection, and comparison, to present facts and reason, criticize the wavering capitalist thinking of the well-to-do middle peasants, and strike at the reactionary remarks of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries.

	The main achievements of the first batch of great debates that have already concluded are fourfold:

	(1) It has raised the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses, and initially resolved the issue of the two roads ideologically. Except for a few well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas who still stick to their own opinions, the vast majority of members are more determined to take the road of collectivization, and those who previously wanted to withdraw from the cooperatives now no longer want to withdraw. Individual households are also actively requesting to join, and agricultural cooperatives are more consolidated. According to statistics from 15 counties including Panshi, Jiaohe, Lishu, and Dongfeng, 1,867 peasant households outside the cooperatives were approved to join the agricultural cooperatives after the great debate. In Jiutai County, out of 808 individual households, 503 actively requested to join the cooperatives. Zhu Xiulin, an individual peasant from Xinfa Township in Panshi County, joined the cooperative with two horses and a cart. When he was approved to join the cooperative, the members even held a welcome meeting. In Jiaohe County, 145 members who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative no longer wanted to withdraw. In Nongan County, more than 200 head of livestock that were previously pulled out of the cooperative by members were now returned to the agricultural cooperative.

	(2) The grain policy has been further implemented, establishing a general view of caring for the country and caring for the collective, and the idea of running cooperatives and managing households diligently and thriftily, criticizing the erroneous behavior of loss and waste, private distribution of grain, and exaggerated reports of disasters and concealment of production, laying an ideological foundation for completing this year's grain purchase tasks. The Wuxing Cooperative in the Yantongshan area of Panshi County originally had 66 households claiming grain shortages, but now they have sold 2,900 jin of grain to the state. According to incomplete statistics, more than 32,000 jin of old grain have been purchased throughout the region, and most members have proposed not to buy back the more than 200,000 jin of revolving grain stored in the grain department. In Shulan and Panshi counties, 155 cooperatives have established patriotic, cooperative-loving, thrifty household management, production increase, and grain saving covenants. The Happiness Road Cooperative in Dehui County has formulated a plan for quick pulling, quick threshing, and achieving five cleanlinesses in the autumn harvest, which can increase income by 88,000 jin of grain.

	(3) The agricultural cooperatives have been initially rectified, autumn harvest distribution plans have been formulated, the "three guarantees" have been adjusted, and financial accounts have been promptly disclosed. As a result, the labor enthusiasm of members has greatly increased, and many new atmospheres have emerged in the current production. The labor attendance rate has generally increased from about 60% to about 90%. The Guojiadian District of Lishu County has accumulated more than 10,000 hectares of manure fertilizer, accounting for 49% of the fertilizer application area in the district, an increase of 18% compared with the same period last year.

	(4) Cadres have initially gained experience in conducting socialist ideological education for peasants. In the great debate, most cadres learned to use the mass line working method of presenting facts and reasoning to handle contradictions among the people, and clarified the two types of contradictions, enhanced their work confidence, improved their work style, and became more active in their work. In Jiaohe County, 40 cooperative cadres who originally wanted to quit are now working actively again; in the Yushutai District of Lishu County, among the 443 production team leaders, 150 were not working actively before the debate, but after the debate, except for 10 who were replaced, the rest became active in their work.

    吉林农村大辩论收获巨大
    要退社的不退了，单干户要求入社，喊缺粮的卖出了陈粮，社员出勤率大大提高，要求不干的社干部又积极起来
    据吉林日报消息　吉林全省农村大鸣大放大辩论，第一批农业社已经于9月下旬先后结束。据四十七个市县的统计，共有两千七百四十七个农业社（占总社数40％强）开展了大鸣大放大辩论。
    从各地已经结束的第一批大鸣大放大辩论的情况看，运动基本是健康的。在大鸣大放大辩论中，广大群众都积极地对粮食和其它农产品统购统销、合作化有没有优越性等问题展开了辩论；对农业社经营管理、干部作风等方面也提出了许多意见。大部分贫农和下中农及部分富裕中农，都以亲身经历，用算账、回忆、对比等办法，摆事实、讲道理，批判了动摇的富裕中农的资本主义思想，并且打击了地主、富农和反革命分子的反动言论。
    已经结束的第一批大辩论取得的主要成绩有四：
    （一）提高了干部和群众的社会主义觉悟，初步从思想上解决了两条道路的问题。除了个别资本主义思想严重的富裕中农，仍坚持己见外，绝大部分社员走合作化道路的思想更加坚定了，而从前想要退社的现在也不退社了，单干户也积极要求入社，农业社更加巩固了。据磐石、蛟河、梨树、东丰等十五个县的统计，大辩论后有一千八百六十七户社外农民被批准参加了农业社。九台县在八百零八户单干户中，就有五百零三户积极要求入社。磐石县新发乡单干农民祝秀林，将两匹马、一辆车都加入到合作社里，当他被批准入社的时候，社员还开了欢迎会。蛟河县有一百四十五户要退社的社员不退社了。农安县有二百多头牲畜，过去由社拉出去，现在又送还给农业社。
    （二）粮食政策得到进一步贯彻，树立了关心国家关心集体的全局观念和勤俭办社、勤俭持家的思想，批判了损失浪费、私分粮食和多报灾情、隐瞒产量的错误行为，给今年完成征购粮食任务打下了思想基础。磐石县烟筒山区五星社原有六十六户喊缺粮，现在他们还卖给国家两千九百斤粮食。据不完全统计全区已收购陈粮三万二千多斤，而存在粮食部门的二十余万斤周转粮，大多数社员提出不往回买了。舒兰、磐石两县有一百五十五个社订了爱国、爱社、勤俭持家、增产节约粮食公约。德惠县幸福之路社订了秋收中快拉、快打和作到五净的计划，可多收入八万八千斤粮食。
    （三）农业社初步进行了整顿，制订了秋收分配计划，调整了“三包”，并及时公开了财务账目。因此，社员的劳动积极性大大提高，当前生产中出现了许多新气象。劳动出勤率一般都由原来60％左右提高到90％左右。梨树县郭家店区共积了一万多公顷地的粪肥，占全区施肥面积49％，较去年同时期增加18％。
    （四）干部初步取得了对农民进行社会主义思想教育的经验。在大辩论中，多数干部学会了用摆事实、讲道理的群众路线的工作方法，来处理人民内部矛盾，并且划清了两类性质的矛盾，增强了工作信心，改进了工作作风，工作更加积极了。蛟河县有四十名原来要求不干的社干部，现在又积极工作了；梨树县榆树台区四百四十三名生产队长中，在辩论前有一百五十名不积极工作，辩论后除换了十名外，其余的人工作都积极起来了。
