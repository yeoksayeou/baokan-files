　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 15th - The headquarters of the Communist Party of India here released this morning the full text of four resolutions passed by the Party's Central Committee. The Central Committee concluded its week-long meeting on Sunday.

　　The resolution regarding the Second Five-Year Plan calls for a meeting of all parties to discuss the difficulties facing the Second Five-Year Plan. The resolution states that the Communist Party of India "firmly believes that the current foreign exchange difficulties can be overcome by expanding domestic sources and reorganizing our foreign trade." The resolution criticizes the policies pursued by the Indian government and believes that the current crisis facing the plan is mainly caused by these policies. The resolution calls for an immediate change in these policies, advocating the nationalization of banks, the immediate implementation of basic land reform, and the state operation of all foreign trade. The resolution believes that certain interest groups not only do not accept these basic measures, but are instead trying to take advantage of the current difficulties "to make concessions to American and other imperialist monopoly capitalists and invite them in to undermine the country's economic and political independence. This harbors dangers to the country, national independence, and the country's peaceful foreign policy."

　　In another resolution, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India expressed serious concern about some recent remarks by Indian Finance Minister Krishnamachari. The resolution states that Krishnamachari, on the eve of his departure for the United States, "actually slandered India's two most friendly countries - the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. India signed the historic Panchsheel Declaration with these two countries." The resolution says that the Finance Minister's views and activities raise extremely important principled questions about our country's independent and democratic development.

　　The resolution on the food situation points out that widespread famine and near-famine conditions prevail in vast areas of Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. While criticizing the government's failure in food policy, the resolution also put forward several suggestions to cope with the current situation. Some of the emergency measures recommended are: setting minimum prices for grain; requisitioning grain from rich peasants and landlords; confiscating the grain stored by large merchants and flour mill owners and strictly controlling bank loans; and liberating peasants from the exploitation of landlords and moneylenders. The resolution calls for "concerted national efforts" and the launch of a nationwide movement to solve the food crisis.

　　The resolution on the report of the Official Languages Commission states that the Communist Party of India agrees that Hindi should eventually become the official language of India, but its implementation should not sacrifice local languages. The resolution suggests adopting local languages as the medium of education and the official languages of the states as a first step, and that the question of when only Hindi will be the official language of the Indian Federation should be decided later.

　　General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh held a press conference today to explain the above resolutions. He said that the Communist Party of India's congress will hold an extraordinary meeting in Amritsar in the last week of January next year to discuss the organizational changes proposed by the Central Committee.

　　印共中央委员会通过四项决议
　　要求召开各党派会议讨论第二个五年计划的困难；批评印度财政部长对中苏两国的诽谤；主张采取一些紧急措施解决粮食危机；建议用地方语言作为教育语言和各邦正式语言，最后使印地文成为国语。
    新华社新德里15日电　这里印度共产党总部今天上午发表了党中央委员会通过的四项决议的全文。党中央委员会在星期日结束了为期一星期的会议。
    关于第二个五年计划的决议要求召开各党派会议来讨论第二个五年计划面临的困难。决议说，印度共产党“坚信目前的外汇困难能够用扩大国内来源和改组我国对外贸易来克服。”决议批评了印度政府奉行的政策，并且认为目前计划遭到的危机主要是这些政策造成的。决议要求立即改变这些政策，主张把银行收归国有，立即实行基本的土地改革，一切对外贸易由国家经营。决议认为有某些利益集团不但不接受这些基本措施，反而在设法利用目前的困难，“对美国和其他帝国主义垄断资本家作出让步和邀请他们进来以破坏国家的经济和政治独立。这里蕴藏着危害国家、国家的独立、国家的和平外交政策的危险。”
    印度共产党中央委员会在另外一项决议中对印度财政部长克里希纳马查里最近的一些谈话表示严重的不安。决议说，克里希纳马查里在启程前往美国的前夕“竟诽谤印度的两个最友好的国家——苏联和中华人民共和国。而印度跟这两个国家是签订了历史性的潘查希拉宣言的”。决议说，财政部长的这些意见和活动引起了对我国独立和民主发展极其重要的原则问题。
    关于粮食情况的决议指出了比哈尔邦、北方邦东部、马哈拉施特拉邦和拉贾斯坦邦广阔的地区普遍发生饥荒和接近饥荒的情况。在批评政府的粮食政策的失败的同时，决议还提出了若干应付当前局势的建议。建议采取的一些紧急措施是：规定粮食的最低价格；向富农和地主征购；把大商人和面粉厂主的存粮充公和严格控制银行垫款以及把农民从地主和放债人的剥削下解放出来。决议号召“全国一致努力”并且开展全国范围的运动以解决粮食危机。
    关于正式语言委员会的报告的决议说，印度共产党同意印地文最后成为印度的正式语言，但是不能牺牲地方语言来实行。决议建议采用地方语言作为教育工具和各邦的正式语言，以此作为第一步，至于什么时候只有印地文是印度联邦的正式语言的问题应当在以后决定。
    总书记高士今天举行记者招待会，解释上述决议。他说，印度共产党代表大会将在明年1月的最后一个星期在阿姆利则举行非常会议，讨论中央委员会所建议的组织上的改变。
