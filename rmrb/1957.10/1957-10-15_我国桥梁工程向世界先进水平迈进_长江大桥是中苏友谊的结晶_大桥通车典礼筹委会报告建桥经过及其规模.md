Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 14th: The Preparatory Committee for the Inauguration and Opening Ceremony of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge held a report meeting today, reporting the construction process and scale of the Yangtze River Bridge to Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, responsible persons from relevant central departments, and Chinese and foreign guests who came to participate in the ceremony.

Peng Min, Director of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, said at the report meeting: "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China's bridge engineering science and technology are advancing towards the world's advanced level with heroic strides. The Yangtze River Bridge is a milestone on the road to progress."

Peng Min then said that turning the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, with its deep water and rapid currents, into a thoroughfare demonstrates the superiority of China's socialist system.

Peng Min emphasized in his report: "The completion of the Yangtze River Bridge demonstrates the importance of Sino-Soviet friendship and unity and Soviet technical assistance. Chinese and Soviet engineering and technical personnel cooperated to create new basic structures and new construction methods. Over the past three years, whether it is the achievement of new technologies, the improvement of technical levels, or the growth of the bridge construction team, the warm and sincere help of Soviet experts has enabled us to learn a lot of valuable knowledge and experience, which we will never forget. The construction process of the Yangtze River Bridge is also the process of our learning from the Soviet Union."

Wang Juqian, Chief Engineer of the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, reported on the engineering technology of the Yangtze River Bridge at the meeting. He said that the pipe pile foundation construction method used in building the Yangtze River Bridge has six advantages: First, all work can be done on the water surface, thus avoiding harmful working conditions; second, it is not limited by the nature and shape of the riverbed rock; third, it is relatively free from water level restrictions, and work can be carried out regularly throughout the year, thereby shortening the construction period; fourth, floating transportation is simpler, and less construction machinery is required; fifth, the amount of work and cost are relatively low; sixth, this foundation construction method can also be widely used in other water conservancy projects and industrial construction.

After the report meeting, a scientific film documenting the construction process of the Yangtze River Bridge was also screened.

　　我国桥梁工程向世界先进水平迈进
    长江大桥是中苏友谊的结晶
    大桥通车典礼筹委会报告建桥经过及其规模
    新华社武汉14日电　武汉长江大桥落成、通车典礼筹委会今天举行报告会，向前来参加典礼的国务院副总理李富春和中央有关部门负责人及中外来宾，报告了长江大桥的建桥经过及其规模。
    武汉长江大桥工程局局长彭敏在报告会上说：“中国桥梁工程科学和技术，在中国共产党的领导下正以豪迈的步伐向着世界先进水平前进，长江大桥就是前进道路上的一个里程碑。”
    彭敏接着说，把水深流急的长江天堑变为通途，说明了我国社会主义制度的优越性。
    彭敏在报告中强调说：“长江大桥的建成，说明了中苏友好团结、苏联技术援助的重要。中苏工程技术人员合作创造了新的基础结构和新的施工方法。三年来，不论是新技术的成就，技术水平的提高，以及桥梁建设队伍的成长，苏联专家热情真诚的帮助，使我们学到了很多宝贵的知识和经验，使我们永远难忘。长江大桥建设的过程，也就是我们学习苏联的过程。”
    长江大桥工程局总工程师汪菊潜，在会上报告了长江大桥的工程技术。他说，修筑长江大桥采用的管柱基础施工方法，有六个优点：一，全部工作都可以在水面上作，因此可以避免有害的劳动条件；二，不受河床岩层性质和形状的限制；三，相对地不受水位限制，一年四季经常可以工作，从而缩短工期；四，浮运工作较简单，施工机具需要较少；五，工程量和造价都比较低；六，这种基础施工方法，在其他水利工程和工业建设中也可以广泛应用。
    报告会结束以后，还放映了纪录长江大桥施工经过的科学影片。
