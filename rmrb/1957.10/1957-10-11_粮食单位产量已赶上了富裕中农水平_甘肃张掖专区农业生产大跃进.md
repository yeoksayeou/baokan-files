Grain Unit Yields Catching Up to the Level of Prosperous Middle Peasants
	Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production in Zhangye Prefecture, Gansu
(Our dispatch) The overall agricultural production in Zhangye Prefecture, Gansu Province, has basically reached the production level of prosperous middle peasants. This area has fertile land but is subject to extensive cultivation, wind, and sand damage, and frost. Before liberation, the prosperous middle peasants here produced about 300 catties per mu. It is estimated that the average yield per mu here can reach 308 catties this year. The average unit yield of grain in Zhangye County this year is more than 400 catties, which has exceeded the production level of prosperous middle peasants. Based on the above situation, the Zhangye Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China estimates that after three years of efforts, the region's agricultural production can completely surpass the production level of prosperous middle peasants.
	The production level in Zhangye Prefecture in the early days of liberation was not high. In 1950, the average grain yield was 157 catties per mu, which is nearly half of the current yield. One of the important factors for the rapid increase in crop yields in Zhangye Prefecture is the vigorous construction of water conservancy projects and the expansion of the irrigated area. Over the past eight years, the counties in the prefecture have built five major river system backbone canal projects, 919 kilometers of branch canals, 63 small reservoirs, five medium-sized reservoirs, and more than 58,000 wells, expanding the irrigated area by nearly 2.8 million mu in the past eight years.
	Afforestation and improvement of agricultural technology also play a significant role in increasing the unit yield of farmland. Over the past eight years, the entire prefecture has afforested 2.3 million mu, stabilized 2,800 mu of sand dunes, and built more than 2,800 li of windbreak walls. Due to afforestation and sand control, the phenomenon of farmland being buried by wind and sand has been basically stopped.
	In terms of improving agricultural technology, in addition to adopting improved varieties and changing from broadcast sowing to row sowing, fertilizer application has also been rationally increased. Due to these measures, the unit yield of grain has increased significantly. Taking wheat as an example, this year, several townships and cooperatives have achieved a yield of 800 catties per mu.
	Most of the measures to increase production in Zhangye Prefecture have been universally promoted after agricultural cooperativization. The realization of agricultural cooperativization is a fundamental factor for the rapid leap forward in agricultural production. According to surveys, the production increase rate in the prefecture after the land reform was 19%, and the production increase rate after cooperativization was 28%.

　　粮食单位产量已赶上了富裕中农水平
    甘肃张掖专区农业生产大跃进
    本报讯　甘肃省张掖专区全区农业生产，基本上达到富裕中农的生产水平。这个地区土地肥沃，但是耕作粗放并有风沙冻害。解放以前，这里富裕中农每亩地的产量约三百斤。预计今年这里每亩地的平均产量可以达到三百零八斤。张掖县今年的粮食平均单位产量是四百斤以上，已超过富裕中农的生产水平了。中共张掖地委会根据上述情况估计，经过三年的努力，全区农业生产完全可以超过富裕中农的生产水平。
    张掖专区解放初期的生产水平是不高的。1950年粮食平均每亩产一百五十七斤，和现在的产量相差近半。张掖专区农作物产量迅速提高的重要因素之一是大力兴修水利，扩大了灌溉面积。专区各县八年来兴修了主要河系的基干渠道工程五处、支干渠道九百一十九公里、小型水库六十三座、中型水库五座，打井五万八千多眼，八年来扩大灌溉面积近二百八十万亩。
    植树造林、改进农业技术对提高农田单位产量也有很大的作用。全专区八年来造林二百三十万亩，压沙丘二千八百亩，营造防风墙二千八百多里。由于造林、压沙，基本上制止了风沙埋没农田的现象。
    在改进农业技术方面，除了采用优良品种、改撒播为条播以外，还合理增施了肥料。由于采取这些措施，粮食的单位产量提高很多。以小麦为例，今年就有几个乡和社达到八百斤的亩产量。
    张掖专区的增产措施，大部分是在农业合作化以后普遍推广的。实现农业合作化是农业生产迅速跃进的基本因素。据调查，专区在土地改革后的增产率是19％，合作化后的增产率是28％。
