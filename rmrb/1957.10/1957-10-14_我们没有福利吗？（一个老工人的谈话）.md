　　Don't We Have Welfare?
　　(A Conversation with an Old Worker)
　　Beijing State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1 Li Lanzhen
　　Some young workers say there is no welfare in our factory. I want to reason with them. We workers live in such good buildings, with water, electricity, and heating, and the rooms are fully equipped with beds and furniture. Isn't this called welfare! They still complain about paying four cents a month for the collective dormitory, saying, "What does the four cents go for?" Don't they think about how water, electricity, and furniture all cost money? They only care about enjoying themselves when they wash clothes, regardless of saving water. Washing faces and clothes requires water, and flushing toilets requires water. Shouldn't these costs be borne by themselves? There are large kettles for water in the collective dormitory, which also belong to the public. Doesn't that cost money? An old man (odd-job man) sweeps the floor, rings the bell, and delivers letters for them every day, and closes the windows in windy and rainy weather. Doesn't the old man need a salary? They also complain about deducting furniture fees, saying that deducting money doesn't count as welfare. A stool costs five yuan, and ten would cost fifty yuan. If you say this isn't welfare, go buy it yourself! Now each stool only costs one cent a month. One cent isn't enough to buy a piece of candy! If this isn't welfare, what is?
　　In order to let the workers eat well, the cafeteria has noodles, steamed buns, and dumplings. The five-cent dishes have a lot of oil, and the six-cent steamed buns are very big. For the early shift, there are also meat buns, fried cakes, and fried dough sticks... They still say the cafeteria is not well-run and the food is expensive. Go outside and buy some to see if the cafeteria is more expensive or the outside is more expensive?
　　I say the factory cares more about us workers than our parents do. When a female worker is only seven months pregnant, the leadership stops her from participating in extracurricular activities. After giving birth, she can rest for two months, and if she is not in good health, she can continue to rest with a doctor's certificate. How close is the nursery to the workshop! They get to breastfeed twice a day, and someone is there to watch their bikes. Before it gets too cold, the workshop has prepared many large cotton jackets for the mothers to wear when they go out to breastfeed at night, to avoid catching a cold. If workers are sick or not in good health, the public pays for them to eat at the nutrition cafeteria. Even a mother at home can hardly take care of you so thoughtfully!
　　Taking a bath in the factory costs nothing, you can wash as much as you want. A haircut costs fifteen cents, and a movie costs fifteen cents. Some people still complain that it's expensive. You have to have some conscience! Let them go to the city for a haircut and a movie, it's expensive, and they have to spend money on transportation.
　　In the past, when we worked in capitalist factories, we didn't even have time to eat a meal. We just grabbed a few mouthfuls of the cold rice we brought from home by the machine, with cotton fibers mixed in. How could we eat it! If a female worker became pregnant, she would be fired. If she was lucky enough to stay, she wouldn't dare to rest after giving birth. She would leave her child at home when she went to work. How could there be time to breastfeed? There is no end to the suffering of the old society, and we will never forget it. Now we have radios in our homes, our children are well-fed and warmly clothed, and they can go to school. They also eat fruit and drink milk every day. My husband and I both work in the factory, and we even hired a nanny to take care of the children. We are very satisfied with the factory's living welfare and have no complaints at all. Look at the young workers, there are several pairs of leather shoes under each bed! Yesterday, the 20th, when we got paid, the department store was packed. They buy whatever they like, and they always have snacks in their mouths. Some of them often run out of money to buy meal tickets in the second half of the month. Do you think they have bad habits because their families have money? But most of them come from poor rural families. When they come to the factory and earn more money, they forget their roots! Some of them don't even give money to their mothers when they ask for it. They haven't suffered in the old society, they only care about the present, and they only think about themselves. They think they should enjoy themselves in the new society. Don't they think that without production, where does the welfare come from? Without labor, where does the enjoyment come from? Young workers have culture and theory, and there are many activists, but there are also some people who talk big, don't work hard in production, and look down on the old workers, saying that the old workers have no theory. I say they have no theory at all! What's the use of theory that doesn't connect with reality? Is separating enjoyment and labor called high level?

　　我们没有福利吗？
　　（一个老工人的谈话）
　　北京国棉一厂  李兰珍
    有的青年工人说我们工厂里没有福利，我想跟他们评评理。我们工人住这么好的楼房，有水、电，有暖气，房子里床铺、家具齐全，这不叫福利吗！集体宿舍每月交四毛钱，他们还有意见，说“四毛钱干什么去了？”他们不想想水、电、家具哪一样不要花钱？他们洗起衣服来只顾痛快，不管节约用水，洗脸、洗衣服要用水，抽水马桶要用水，这些费用难道不该自己负担吗？集体宿舍里打水有大水壶，也是公家的，这不花钱？用个老头（勤杂工），每天给他们扫地、打铃、送信，刮风下雨给关窗，老头不要给工资吗？他们对扣家具费也有意见，说要扣钱，就不叫福利。一个凳子五块钱，十个就得五十块钱，你说这不叫福利，你自己去买吧！现在每个凳子每月才扣一分钱，一分钱不够买一块糖！这不叫福利又叫什么？
    为了让工人吃得好，食堂里面条、馒头、饺子样样都有，五分钱的菜好多油，六分钱的馒头好大一个，早班还有肉包子、炸糕、油饼……，他们还说食堂办不好，东西贵，你到外面去买买看，到底食堂贵还是外面贵？
    我说工厂对我们工人比父母对我们还关心。女工怀孕刚七个月，领导上就不叫参加业余活动，生了孩子可以休息两个月，身体不好的经大夫证明还可以继续休息。托儿所离车间多近啊！每天两趟喂奶，有人给看车，天还没大冷，车间已准备了许多大棉猴，让妈妈晚上出去喂奶时披着，免得着了凉。工人们有了病，或者身体不好的，就由公家贴钱吃营养食堂，在家里，就连母亲也难照顾得这样周到啊！
    在厂里洗澡，一钱不花，爱怎么洗怎么洗，理发一毛五，看电影一毛五，有人还嫌贵，得有点良心啊！让他们到城里去理发、看电影，贵还不说，还得花来回车钱。
    我们过去在资本家的工厂里做工，连吃顿饭的时间都没有，家里带去的凉饭，就在车旁扒上几口，饭里带进了花毛，那里吃得下去！女工怀了孕就要被裁，运气好的留下来了，生完孩子也不敢休息。上班时把孩子扔在家里，那有喂奶的时间？旧社会受的苦处讲不完，也永远忘不了。现在我们家里有了收音机，孩子们吃饱、穿暖，还能上学，每天还吃水果、牛奶。我和孩子的爸爸都在厂里工作，为了照顾孩子，还请了一个保姆。对工厂的生活福利，我们很满意，完全没有意见。再看看青年工人，那个床底下不是几双皮鞋！昨天20号发薪，百货公司可挤了，他们见什么好买什么，成天零食不离嘴，有的常常到了下半月连买饭票的钱都花光了。你说他们是家里有钱养成的坏习惯吗？可是大部分又都是农村贫苦人家出身。到了工厂钱挣得多了，就忘了老根了！有的连妈妈来要钱都不给。他们没在旧社会受过苦，只顾眼前，尽考虑个人，认为新社会就应该享受，他们不想想没有生产，哪来的福利？没有劳动，哪来的享受？青年工人有文化，有理论，有很多积极分子，但是也有一些人嘴上说的夸夸的，生产不好好地干，还瞧不起老工人，嫌老工人没有理论。我说他们才没有理论呢！理论不联系实际有什么用？把享受和劳动分开来，这能叫水平高吗？
