Raising Grain Prices is Primarily Disadvantageous to Farmers
Conclusion of a Production Team Debate in Heishan County

(Reported by our newspaper) The 23rd Production Team of the Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Gaoshanzi Township, Heishan County, Liaoning Province, launched a socialist debate on whether grain prices were low, whether farmers lost money selling grain to the state, and whether raising grain prices would benefit farmers.

The working group of the Heishan County Committee of the Communist Party of China helped the farmers calculate the cost of grain at the debate. Taking sorghum as an example: for one hectare of land, based on applying sufficient manure, the cost of manure fertilizer is 50 yuan, seeds are 2 yuan, labor costs are 91.50 yuan, animal labor is 41 yuan, feeding labor is 10 yuan, agricultural tax is 30 yuan, and management fee is 5 yuan, totaling 229.50 yuan in expenses. On the income side, calculated according to a normal year this year, one hectare of land produces 3,500 jin of grain (the local annual output is 3,800 jin), which sells for 5 fen per jin (the state purchases first-grade sorghum at 5.24 fen), generating an income of 175 yuan; 1,800 bundles of sorghum stalks, calculated at the lowest firewood price of 4 yuan per hundred bundles, generating an income of 72 yuan; and sorghum stalks for fuel at 5 yuan, totaling 252 yuan in income, resulting in a net profit of 22.50 yuan, with a profit of about 10%. The working group also pointed out: The cost expenditure of agricultural products, unlike industrial products, is partly derived from and used for the benefit of the cooperative members. For example, the 50 yuan for manure is for buying manure fertilizer from the cooperative members. After calculating this account clearly, the cooperative members suddenly realized and said: "In the past, we only argued about losing money selling grain, but no one had ever calculated it; this time, after calculating, we know that grain prices are not low."

Accountant Kang Jiufu calculated the following account for all the team members regarding the issue of whether raising grain prices would benefit farmers: Last year, the whole cooperative sold 300,000 jin of grain to the state. Assuming the price of sorghum was raised to 1 jiao per jin, the whole cooperative would earn an additional 15,000 yuan. According to the work points earned by the cooperative members, last year the cooperative members earned more than 2.8 million work points, so one work point would be worth only a little more than 5 li, and a high-quality laborer would earn only a little more than 10 yuan. For cooperative members buying grain, taking a family of five as an example, they would need 2,600 jin, costing an additional 130 yuan.

Through debate, the cooperative members' misunderstanding of the grain price issue was eliminated. Wu Zhiqi, who had previously actively demanded an increase in grain prices, said regretfully: "This time I understand this account. How dangerous! I fell into my own trap. Grain prices must not be raised. I withdraw my opinion."

    提高粮价首先对农民不利
    黑山县一个生产队大辩论的结论
    本报讯　辽宁黑山县高山子乡友谊农业社第二十三生产队就粮食价格低不低、农民把粮食卖给国家是否赔钱、提高粮价对农民有没有利？展开了一次社会主义大辩论。
    中共黑山县委工作组帮助农民在辩论会上核算了粮食成本。以高粱为例：一垧地按上满粪算，粪肥五十元、种籽两元、人工费九十一元五角、畜工四十一元、饲养工十元、农业税三十元和管理费五元，计支出二百二十九元五角。收入方面，今年按一般年景计算，一垧地产粮三千五百斤（当地常年产量三千八百斤），每斤卖五分（国家收购一等高粱五分二厘四毫），卖钱一百七十五元，秫秸一千八百捆，按最低烧柴价格算每百捆四元，卖钱七十二元，高粱荛子五元，共卖钱二百五十二元，净得利润二十二元五角，有10％左右利润。工作组又指出：农产品的成本支出，不像工业品那样，有的是取之于社员，又用之于社员，比如粪钱五十元，就是买社员的粪肥。算清这笔账后，社员们恍然大悟，都说：过去光吵吵卖粮赔钱，但是谁也没有算过；这回一算才知道粮食价格并不低。
    记账员康九富就提高粮价对农民有没有利的问题向全队社员算了这样一笔账：去年全社卖给国家三十万斤粮食，假设高梁提价到一角钱一斤，全社多卖一万五千元，按社员作的工分分配，去年全社社员作了二百八十多万工分，一个工分才多分五厘多，一个上等劳动力多分十元多钱。社员买粮，以五口人家来说，需要两千六百斤，多花一百三十元。
    经过辩论，消除了社员对粮价问题的误解，原来积极要求提高粮价的吴志起后悔地说：“这回我才明白了这个账，好险，自己上了自己的当，粮价可别提高，我收回我的意见。”
