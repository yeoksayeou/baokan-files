　　First Be a Farmer, Then a Cadre

　　Thirty-Eight University Graduates Assigned to Southwest Normal College Go to Agricultural Cooperatives

　　(Our dispatch) Thirty-eight university graduates who were assigned to work at Southwest Normal College this summer vacation have recently gone to agricultural cooperatives in Beibei Jingang, Shuangbei, Yongyuan, and other places to participate in half a year of physical labor.

　　Everyone is very excited about being able to truly go to the countryside to get close to the peasants and work with them. Zhang Xiuhua said excitedly: "The Party has placed us in labor to train us, and will train us to become more useful people. I myself am willing to be a primary school student and learn from the peasants honestly."

    本报讯　今年暑假分配到西南师范学院工作的三十八名高等学校毕业生，于最近分别到北碚金钢、双碑、永远等农业合作社参加为时半年的体力劳动。
    大家对这次能真正到农村中去接近农民，和他们共同劳动感到非常兴奋。张秀华激动地说：“党把我们放到劳动中去锻炼，将把我们锻炼成为更有用的人，我自己甘愿作个小学生，老老实实地向农民学习。”
