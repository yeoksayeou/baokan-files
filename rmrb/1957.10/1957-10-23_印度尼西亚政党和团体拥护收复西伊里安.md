Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 22nd. Indonesian National Party Chairman Suwirjo told a reporter from "Indonesia Torch Daily" that the Indonesian National Party fully supports the government's struggle to recover West Irian.

Suwirjo said that, on the West Irian issue, in addition to the efforts already made, clear and concrete steps should also be taken. The government has not yet satisfied the wishes of the people.

He said that the Indonesian National Party fully supports Foreign Minister Subandrio's statement at the United Nations: If the United Nations cannot resolve the West Irian issue, Indonesia will take other measures to achieve the recovery of West Irian.

The Central Committee of the Indonesian Farmers' Front also issued a statement last night, expressing the hope that the government, in addition to carrying out the struggle to recover West Irian at the United Nations, will bravely take other corresponding steps to deal with the Netherlands, resolutely take measures against Dutch monopoly capitalists, recognize that the land belonging to Dutch plantation owners and cultivated by farmers belongs to the farmers, reclaim the Dutch lease rights in Indonesia, abolish its other privileges, and regulate all Dutch enterprises in Indonesia.

Utomo, First Vice Chairman of the Indonesian Veterans' Affairs Federation, also issued a statement saying that if the Netherlands overestimates its capabilities and continues to occupy West Irian, it should quickly take over all enterprises in Indonesia belonging to Dutch monopoly capital.

    印度尼西亚政党和团体拥护收复西伊里安
    新华社雅加达22日电　印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约对“印度尼西亚火炬报”记者说，印度尼西亚国民党完全支持政府进行收复西伊里安的斗争。
    苏维约说，但是，在西伊里安问题上，除了目前已经作出的努力以外，还应该采取明确具体的步骤。目前政府还没有满足社会的愿望。
    他说，印度尼西亚国民党完全支持外交部长苏班德里约在联合国所讲的话：如果联合国不能解决西伊里安问题，印度尼西亚将采取其他途径来实现收复西伊里安。
    印度尼西亚农民阵线中央委员会昨天晚上也发表声明，表示希望政府在联合国进行收复西伊里安的斗争以外，勇敢地采取其他相应的步骤来对付荷兰，断然地对荷兰垄断资本家采取措施，承认由农民耕作的属于荷兰种植园主的土地归农民所有，收回荷兰在印度尼西亚的租借权和取消它的其他特权，管制荷兰在印度尼西亚的一切企业。
    印度尼西亚退伍军人事业总会第一副主席乌托莫也发表声明说，如果荷兰不知自量，仍然要继续霸占西伊里安，就应当迅速接收荷兰垄断资本在印度尼西亚的所有企业。
