Serving Scientific Research Work

Tianjin Establishes Central Library

(Our dispatch) To serve scientific research work, the Tianjin Central Library has been established, with the Tianjin People's Library, Tianjin Natural Science and Technology Library, and Tianjin Medical Library as its core. It will incorporate the libraries of eight schools, including Tianjin University, Nankai University, Tianjin Normal College, Tianjin Medical College, and Hebei Tianjin Normal College.

The Central Library mainly serves scientific research work. The eight libraries currently hold more than two million volumes. Based on the characteristics and conditions of each library, their respective divisions of labor and borrowing methods have been determined. In order to exchange information on the collections of each member library, the Central Library will compile a joint catalog of various scientific books and periodicals held by major libraries in Tianjin, as well as a new book bulletin.

The establishment of the Central Library is of great benefit to the purchasing work of major libraries in Tianjin. According to the specialties and characteristics of each library, they will cooperate and divide their work, avoiding unnecessary duplication. According to incomplete statistics, the number of periodicals ordered by various units (excluding the eight libraries) has been reduced from more than 700 to more than 400, while the types have not decreased but have increased, saving the state more than 13,000 yuan.

    为科学研究工作服务
    天津成立中心图书馆
    本报讯　以天津市人民图书馆、天津市自然科学技术图书馆、天津市医学图书馆为核心，将天津大学、南开大学、天津师范学院、天津医学院、河北天津师范学院等八个学校的图书馆组成天津市中心图书馆。
    中心图书馆主要为科学研究工作服务。这八个图书馆现藏书两百多万册。根据各个图书馆的特点和条件，已确定了相互间的分工和借阅办法。为了交流各成员馆藏书情况，中心图书馆将编辑天津市各大型图书馆所藏各种科学书、刊联合目录及新书通报。
    中心图书馆的成立，对天津市各大图书馆采购工作有很大好处。根据各馆的专长特点分工合作，避免了不必要的重复。据不完全统计，仅各单位订购期刊（不包括八个图书馆）由七百多份减为四百多份，而种类没有减少反有增加，为国家节约了一万三千多元。
