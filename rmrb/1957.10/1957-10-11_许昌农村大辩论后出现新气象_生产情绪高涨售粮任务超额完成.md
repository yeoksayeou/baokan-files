　　New Atmosphere Emerges After Great Debate in Rural Xuchang
    Production Enthusiasm Soars, Grain Sales Exceed Quota

    (Our Dispatch) Since the socialist great debate centered on grain issues concluded in 843 agricultural cooperatives in Xuchang Prefecture’s countryside, the class consciousness and socialist awareness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have been universally raised. At the same time, new customs have emerged in rural production, grain sales, and thrift.

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have consistently advocated correcting shortcomings and running the cooperatives well. Because their own understanding was muddled in the past, they were also influenced by the "shouting" of some well-to-do middle peasants. Now, they have strengthened their confidence in taking the socialist road and drawn a clear line between themselves and well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas. For example, Sang Fa'an, a poor peasant from Sang Village, Mengcun Township, Caizhai Township, Changge County, said: "In the past, I only knew that my own grain was enough to eat (360 jin), but I didn't dare to refute when people said they didn't have enough to eat. After this debate, I realized that three out of the six well-to-do middle peasant households in our team had surplus grain. Only then did I realize what they were trying to do by shouting."

    According to statistics from 4,416 poor peasant households, before the movement, 52% were determined to take the socialist road, 35% were average, and 13% had slight dissatisfaction with the new society. Now, the number firmly supporting socialism has increased from 52% to over 80%. This shows that the basic force of the socialist revolution in the countryside, mainly composed of poor and hired peasants, has begun to take shape.

    Secondly, changes have also occurred among the well-to-do middle peasants. In this fierce socialist debate, due to our adherence to the policy of presenting the facts and reasoning things out, many well-to-do middle peasants have also improved their understanding. According to statistics from 1,200 new and old well-to-do middle peasant households, before the movement, 37% were willing to take the socialist road, 36% followed the crowd, and 27% resisted and opposed the socialist system. After the movement, 72% were willing to take the socialist road, and about 5% resisted and opposed the socialist system. This shows that the changes among the well-to-do middle peasants are also significant.

    Another change is the increase in the backbone leading the socialist revolution. Through this movement, a large number of activists have emerged in the countryside. According to statistics from five communes including Wuyang, the number of activists increased from 1,118 before the movement to 1,381, an increase of 24% compared to before the movement.

    Due to the above-mentioned tremendous changes, new customs have emerged in the three aspects of rural production, grain sales, and thrift. For example, the masses of the Ma Wa Commune in Lushan generally reflected: "After a great debate, our hearts are bright and clear. If we want to eat more grain, we must put our efforts into the land." A production upsurge has emerged. The commune has a total of more than 3,700 mu of wheat sown area this year. As of September 20, more than 2,000 mu have been irrigated. In Songzhuang Township, Ye County, more than 3,400 mu were irrigated within ten days, accounting for 49% of the total task of drought-resistant wheat planting. Even if not a drop of rain falls, the wheat planting task can be guaranteed to be completed before October 12.

    According to statistics from Shipotou in Lushan and Shuangmiao in Changge alone, more than 198,000 jin of surplus grain was sold to the state after the debate. The total autumn grain purchase in Lushan County has been put into storage at 930,000 jin, an increase of more than five times compared with the amount put into storage in the same period last year.

　　许昌农村大辩论后出现新气象
    生产情绪高涨售粮任务超额完成
    本报讯　许昌专区农村已经有八百四十三个农业合作社结束了以粮食问题为中心的大辩论。经过社会主义大辩论，广大的贫农和下中农的阶级觉悟和社会主义觉悟有了普遍提高，同时，农村生产、售粮、勤俭持家等方面都出现了新的风尚。
    广大的贫农和下中农一向是积极主张改正缺点办好合作社的。由于过去自己认识糊涂，也曾受到某些富裕中农“叫喊”的影响。现在，他们坚定了走社会主义道路的信心，同资本主义思想严重的富裕中农划清了界限。如长葛县蔡寨乡孟村桑村贫农桑法安说：“过去只知道自己的粮食足够吃（三百六十斤），但对人家说不够吃的话，也不敢反驳；经过这次辩论，俺队六户富裕中农，三户都有余粮，这时我才算认清了他们的叫嚷是想干啥的了。”
    据四千四百十六户贫农的统计，运动前坚决走社会主义道路的占52％，一般的占35％，对新社会稍有不满情绪的占13％。现在坚决拥护社会主义的由52％增长到80％以上。这说明了目前农村以贫雇农为主的社会主义革命的基本队伍，已经开始形成了。
    其次在富裕中农当中也发生了变化。在这场激烈的社会主义辩论中，由于我们坚持了摆事实讲道理的方针，不少的富裕中农认识也提高了。据一千二百户新老富裕中农中的统计，运动前愿意走社会主义道路的占37％，随大流的占36％，抵触与反对社会主义制度的占27％；运动后，愿走社会主义道路的占72％，抵触和反对社会主义制度的约占5％。这说明富裕中农的变化也是较大的。
    再一个变化是领导社会主义革命的骨干增多了。经过这次运动，农村中涌现出了大批积极分子。据舞阳等五个社的统计，积极分子由运动前一千一百十八人增长到一千三百八十一人，比运动前增长24％。
    由于上述的巨大变化，促使了目前农村生产、售粮、勤俭持家的三个方面出现了新的风尚。如鲁山马挖社群众普遍反映：“大辩论一场，心里亮堂堂，要想多吃粮，必须把劲用到土地上”。出现了生产高潮。这个社今年播麦面积共三千七百多亩，到9月20日止，已浇地二千多亩。叶县宋庄乡在十天之内，浇地三千四百多亩，占抗旱种麦总任务的49％。即使不下一滴雨，种麦任务在10月12日以前可以保证完成。
    仅据鲁山石坡头、长葛双庙两乡统计，在辩论后共多卖给国家余粮十九万八千多斤。鲁山全县秋粮征购已入库九十三万斤，比去年同期入库量增加五倍多。（金天铎）
