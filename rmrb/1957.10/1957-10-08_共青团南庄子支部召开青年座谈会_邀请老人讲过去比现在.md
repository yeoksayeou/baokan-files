    Communist Youth League Nanzhuangzi Branch Holds Youth Forum
    Invites Elders to Talk About the Past Compared to the Present
    (Our Report) According to the Hebei Daily, in order to raise the socialist consciousness of young people and enhance their ability to distinguish between major rights and wrongs, the Communist Youth League Nanzhuangzi Branch of Chengguan Township, Tang County, invited six elders from the village to hold a forum with fifty-four young people.
    At the forum, the elders used their personal experiences of the painful life in the old society to make comparisons with the present, educating the young people. Tian Si, who is in his sixties, said: "Children, it's hard to describe the life in the old society in a few words! In the past, except for the twenty-four wealthy families who took turns serving as village chiefs, which family didn't eat bran and vegetables for half a year? Grandpa Ji De in our village hanged himself on the grave because he couldn't bear the poverty." Wen Zengniang, who is in her seventies, said: "In those years, even the bran wasn't good bran, and we had to eat moldy bran for several years. Eating dumplings made with dark bran flour and cabbage stalk filling was considered good luck for the New Year! Look, now who eats bran and vegetables, and which family doesn't have fine white flour and meat-filled dumplings for the New Year!" Then, the elders answered the young people's questions about the farmers' burning, clothing, and usage in the old society one by one. Wen Zengniang said: "I've lived my whole life, and I only wore fine cloth clothes after joining the cooperative."
    Talking about the past years of famine evoked endless bitterness and pain for the elders. Tian Aiqing and Tian Jinwei, both in their sixties, said: "In the ninth year of the Republic of China, the millstone didn't turn over. The government at that time didn't care whether you had a harvest or not; donations were still collected, and grain was still required. The rent paid to the landlords couldn't be short by even one jin. If any family couldn't afford it, they would be sent to the yamen. People in our village ate all the leaves and wild vegetables. Where did they have the strength to pay grain, donations, and rent! Many families sold their land and furniture; Tian Laokun, Tian Fulu, and Tian Laomei even sold their own fifteen- or sixteen-year-old daughters." Tian Si added painfully: "That year, more than sixty people in our village were begging for food outside." Wen Zengniang wiped her tears and said: "My family sold the only seven mu of land to repay the landlord's debts. The whole family begged for food, and my parents froze and starved to death." She continued: "Look at now, our village has suffered from floods for three years, but not a single family is begging for food, and no one is even eating bran and vegetables or suffering from cold and hunger. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the People's Government promptly issuing relief funds, lending us money to develop sideline businesses, and transporting grain from thousands of miles away, and if it weren't for cooperation, our farmers wouldn't have survived!"
    When some young people said to the elders, "After cooperation, the future of the countryside is bright, but it's just too tiring to work now, getting up early and working late every day. Isn't this more tiring than working in the past?" Tian Wenshu said: "Children, do you know what it was like to work for the landlords in the past? When I worked as a day laborer for the rich man 'Yan Wangdian,' I was assigned to hoe four mu of cotton in a day. If I didn't finish hoeing, I wouldn't get paid. It was really hard work at that time, but you had to do it even if you died of exhaustion, because if you didn't work, you wouldn't have food to eat! Now we are working on our own land for ourselves, more labor, more income. To build socialism, we must exert ourselves!"

    共青团南庄子支部召开青年座谈会
    邀请老人讲过去比现在
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：共青团唐县城关乡南庄子支部为了提高青年的社会主义觉悟，增强他们辨别大是大非的能力，团支部邀请本村六名老人，同五十四名青年进行了一次座谈。
    在座谈会上，老人们用在旧社会亲身经历过的痛苦生活与现在作对比的方法，向青年们进行了教育。六十多岁的田四说：“孩子们，提起旧社会的生活，那真是一言难尽！过去咱村除了轮流当村长的二十四家富户外，谁家不是糠菜半年粮？咱村纪德爷就是因为受不了穷困逼迫，才跑到坟上吊死的。”七十多岁的文增娘说：“那年头吃糠也没有好糠，几年的蒙糠也得吃，过年吃上黑麸子面、白菜帮子馅的饺子就算好运气！你们看看，现在谁家还吃糠咽菜，谁家过年不是细白面，肉馅饺子！”接着，老人们又一一回答了青年们提出的在旧社会农民们的烧、穿、用三个方面的问题。文增娘说：“我活了这一辈子，就是入了社才穿上了细布衣裳。”
    谈起了过去的灾荒年，勾起了老人们说不尽的辛酸苦痛。六十多岁的田爱清和田金未老人说：“民国九年，碌碡不翻身，那时的政府不管你收成不收成，捐照样收，粮照样要，向地主交的租子少一斤也不行，谁家拿不起，就得送衙门。咱村人们连树叶、刺菜都吃光了，哪还有力量交粮拿捐和交租子呢！多少户把土地、家具卖掉；田老坤、田福禄、田老美他们连自己亲生的十五、六岁的闺女都卖了。”田四老人沉痛地补充说：“那一年咱村光要饭在外的就有六十多个人。”文增娘擦了擦眼泪说：“我家为还地主的债，把仅有的七亩地卖掉了，一家子要饭吃，爹娘就活活的冻饿死。”她又说：“看看现在，咱村三年遭水灾，别说没有一家要饭吃，就连吃糠吃菜、受冷受饿的都没有。要不是共产党和人民政府及时给咱们发放了救济款，贷给咱们钱搞副业，千里万里运粮来，要没有合作化，那还有咱农民的命！”
    当有的青年向老人们说到“合作化后，将来农村的前途是美好的，可就是现在干活太累，天天起早熬晌，这不比过去干活辛苦吗？”田文书老人说：“孩子们，你们知道过去给地主干活是什么样子吗？我给财主‘阎王殿’打短工时，一天就定工四亩棉花，锄不完不给钱，那时干活才真辛苦哩，可是累死也得干，不做工那有饭吃！现在咱们是在自己地里给自己干活，多劳动，多收入。建设社会主义，就得卖把力气！”
