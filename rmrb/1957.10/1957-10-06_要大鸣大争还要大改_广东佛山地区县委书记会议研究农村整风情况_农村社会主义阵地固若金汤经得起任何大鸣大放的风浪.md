(Our newspaper's Guangzhou dispatch, 5th) Reporter Lin Li reports: The CCP Foshan Area Committee convened a meeting of county party secretaries on September 28th and 29th to examine and study the current situation of great democracy and great debate in rural areas. According to materials reflected at the meeting, more than 2,400 of the more than 6,000 agricultural cooperatives in the Foshan area have launched socialist education movements. Some of the pilot cooperatives and the first batch of cooperatives that began socialist education movements have conducted 40 days of airing views and expressing opinions, and some have begun arguing and debating. Great democracy and great debate have enlivened the once-stagnant atmosphere in rural areas, and the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the vast number of peasants have been improved. The attendance rate of some Class III cooperatives that "put private interests before public interests" or "attend to private interests but not public interests" has also increased significantly, and the work enthusiasm and level of understanding of district and township cadres have also been correspondingly improved.

The results of great democracy and great debate prove that our rural work can withstand the test, and agricultural cooperatives are not afraid of any storm. No matter how much nonsense there is, the superiority of socialism cannot be denied by anyone.

A month ago, when the Party Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee proposed methods for carrying out great democracy and great debate, rural workers in Foshan, including some leading cadres, were not very clear about whether great democracy and great debate could solve the current rural contradictions. Even those who supported great democracy and great debate and resolutely implemented this policy only "understood it theoretically" or "just did it because the higher authorities asked them to!" Therefore, the movement did not start so smoothly. People were afraid that monsters and demons would be released and could not be cleaned up, and that the airing of views and expressing of opinions would destroy the agricultural cooperatives. Until the movement completed the first stage, some people were still worried that "it is easy to air views and express opinions, but difficult to argue." After a month of practice, people's worries disappeared, and leading great democracy and great debate became everyone's conscious action. When the meeting analyzed the situation of great democracy and great debate in rural areas, people unanimously believed that the current problem was no longer whether to dare to air views and express opinions, but how to air them deeply and express them thoroughly.

Before this meeting, people could only say how many people participated in the meeting and how many people spoke when discussing what "deep and thorough" meant. The meeting clearly stated that the main sign of checking depth and thoroughness is to see who participated in the airing of views and expressing of opinions? What problems did they air and express?

Only by mobilizing the wealthy middle peasants to air views deeply and express opinions thoroughly
Can we form a debate team with poor peasants as the backbone

Reports from various counties prove that it is not difficult for most people in agricultural cooperatives to participate in airing views and expressing opinions meetings. The difficulty is that the representatives of current rural capitalist ideology - some wealthy middle peasants - also participate in airing views and expressing opinions. Without the participation of these people, the essence of capitalism cannot be exposed. In the process of airing views and expressing opinions, these people are generally more passive, or even do not participate in the meeting. Zhongshan County once investigated three types of townships and cooperatives: In Henglan Township, a type one, 37 of the 52 wealthy middle peasant households participated in the meeting; in Zhangjiabian, a type two, 15 of the 33 wealthy middle peasant households participated in the meeting; in Hengwei Cooperative, a type three, only two of the 29 wealthy middle peasant households participated in the meeting. Comrades from Sanshui County said that some wealthy middle peasants not only did not attend the meeting, but also did not speak at the meeting, or sent their wives and children to listen. To mobilize these people to participate in the meeting, we must repeatedly say: 1. The ideological problem of wealthy middle peasants is a contradiction among the people, and it will never be treated as a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy; 2. It is different from settling accounts with landlords and rich peasants; 3. It is not to attack monsters and demons; 4. It is not to fight right-wing elements, and no rightist labels will be put on them. More than half of the wealthy middle peasants in Henglan Township participated in the meeting. In addition to the general meeting talking about policies, they also sent cadres to have individual talks with the wealthy middle peasants to inspire them to air views and express opinions.

Local experience also proves that it is not difficult for middle peasants and wealthy middle peasants to participate in meetings and say that some cadres have poor work styles and that the service attitude of supply and marketing cooperatives is not good. The difficulty is to say "sincere words." The current dissatisfaction of wealthy middle peasants is generally concentrated on the policies of collectivization and unified purchase and marketing. Wealthy middle peasants in Nanhai County said: "Individual farming plus a free market is equal to pork and sesame oil, which makes it fatter and fatter; collectivization plus unified purchase and marketing is equal to pickled vegetables and thin porridge, which makes it taste worse and worse." Wealthy middle peasants in Shunde County want to "overthrow two stations (grain station and purchasing station) and abolish one cooperative (agricultural cooperative)." Wealthy middle peasants in Xinhui County miss 1953 very much, saying that there were "four major freedoms" at that time, which was the "golden age" in the history of farmers' lives... Wealthy middle peasants are reluctant to say these things easily, and our rural workers are most afraid to hear them. Some have just said the beginning, and the poor peasants and backbone elements immediately beat them back, with the result that the debate cannot begin, and the wealthy middle peasants dare not air views and express opinions. Shunde is doing a good job in this regard. They say that letting wealthy middle peasants air views and express opinions should be divided into three stages: releasing the topic, releasing the content, and releasing the proposition. That is to say, if he wants to say that collectivization is not good, the cadres must be patient and listen, and he must say where it is not good, and he must say his propositions and methods. In one agricultural cooperative, the wealthy middle peasants suddenly stopped after releasing the topic and releasing the content, and did not directly put forward their propositions. They just indirectly inquired about the leadership's tone and asked whether the cooperative could be dissolved. The comrade in charge of this cooperative said: "You discuss it, as long as 70% of the members agree, the leadership will approve it. Because this is the regulation of the cooperative's charter." With this, the tails of the wealthy middle peasants were raised high, and the illusions of the middle peasants came. They did not wait for the cadres to come out, but arranged the venue themselves, strung together people to hold meetings, and spread rumors about dissolving the cooperative everywhere. With the active activities of the wealthy middle peasants, the poor peasants became anxious. They found the work team and cried bitterly: "No! The cooperative cannot be dissolved!" Some even said: "I didn't expect the Communist Party to come up with this trick!" When the airing of views and expressing of opinions by wealthy middle peasants in Heshan County reached its climax, the poor peasants stepped forward and shouted loudly: "Come, those who support the cooperative stand to the left, and those who oppose it stand to the right, let's debate." Of the 60 people present, 19 stood to the left, and the rest all stood to the right. However, after preliminary debate, the people on the right slowly turned to the left. In the end, only two people were left on the right, and both of them were wealthy middle peasants. One of the wealthy middle peasants was still sticking to his opinion. He said: "When I was farming individually, I ate meat and wore silk, and a foreign cigarette was stuck on my lips, watching you work for me." At this moment, even those who were not conscious suddenly realized. They said: "Individual farming is the capitalist road, which is for us to be your cattle and horses. No way." The words of the wealthy middle peasants gave the peasants the most vivid and profound lesson.

Based on these, the people attending the meeting believed that the so-called deep and thorough airing of views and expressing of opinions is to bring the agricultural cooperative to the "edge of dissolution." Especially for the Class III cooperatives, if they do not reach this level, they cannot organize a debate team with poor peasants as the backbone, and they cannot dig out the old roots of capitalist ideology. The secretary of the Shunde County Party Committee said that this principle is not only applicable to the problem of agricultural cooperatives, but also to unified purchase and marketing. There is a cooperative there, where some wealthy middle peasants said that various purchase certificates were "diseases," which were "diseases that would kill the Communist Party, and even Hua Tuo could not cure them." Many poor peasants also followed this evil trend and shouted blindly. In order to inspire the poor peasants to seriously think about this issue, the leadership immediately expressed to everyone: "Everyone thinks it is troublesome, so let's make a suggestion to the higher authorities to have all these certificates canceled, okay?" The poor peasants seriously considered the issue. They discussed it in twos and threes, and the unanimous conclusion was that they were "fooled by the wealthy middle peasants." They said that if there were no these certificates, "oil, salt, grain and cloth would fall into the hands of the wealthy middle peasants. Poor peasants can't buy anything." Facts have proved that mobilizing wealthy middle peasants to air views deeply and express opinions thoroughly can not only enlighten the class consciousness of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and thoroughly clarify the major issue of whether socialism is good or capitalism is good, but also educate wealthy middle peasants to abandon the illusion of taking the capitalist road and firmly take the socialist road together with poor peasants and lower-middle peasants.

We must break the argument that it is easy to air views and express opinions but difficult to argue.
Experience proves that as long as you can release it, you can definitely refute it.

In the early stage of the movement, the argument that "it is easy to air views and express opinions but difficult to argue" was quite common. This meeting also made a negative answer. The secretary of the Xinhui County Party Committee said that the current central issue is still airing views and expressing opinions, and as long as they are aired, there is nothing that cannot be refuted. Because the truth is on our side, he said that there is a cooperative in Xinhui, where someone said "it is not free to be forbidden to go to Hong Kong to do business" when discussing "freedom or not." When people heard it, they felt that this was very true and could not be refuted. Later, there was a "specific analysis" saying: "Whoever wants to go to Hong Kong to sign up, you are allowed to go." But after signing up, less than 5% actually wanted to go. The statement of "no freedom" was destroyed in 95% of the population. People continued to ask: "The government allows you to go, does Hong Kong allow you to go?" At this time, even those who signed up to go said: "It is they who do not allow it." From this, people came to the experience that even problems like whether or not to allow going to Hong Kong can be refuted and clarified. Then there is no heresy that cannot be refuted.

Only with great democracy, great debate, and major changes can we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses.

The purpose of great democracy and great debate is to clarify major rights and wrongs and solve the problem of the capitalist or socialist road. However, in the early stage of the movement, both poor peasants and middle peasants would raise a large number of specific problems, or small rights and wrongs problems. The attitude towards these specific problems often determines the key to whether the movement can move forward. In the Longtouhuan Cooperative of Zhongshan County, people raised many opinions in the early stage of airing views and expressing opinions, but the leadership did not deal with them, and the masses said: "What is the use of airing views and expressing opinions, the cadres don't listen?" Longtouhuan Cooperative had just suffered a typhoon, and the sugar cane had been knocked down. The masses had concerns and said: "We can't tighten our belts to air views and express opinions!" After hearing this, the leaders immediately gathered the opinions of the masses, sorted them out, and put forward the problems that needed to be solved urgently at present, and put the aftermath work after the typhoon in the first place. The director of the cooperative and the work team took the lead and went to the fields to support the sugar cane. Then they mobilized more than 40 members and 30 waterwheels to pump water. In this way, the emotions of the masses rose, and they said: "This is called rectifying while reforming." Some cooperatives did not pay attention to this point. The masses raised hundreds of opinions, but the leaders were still shouting to release and air views! As a result, the masses replied: "Change it first, then release it!" The rice fields of the Zhonglu No. 2 Cooperative in Xinhui County suffered a rat plague, but the cadres wanted the masses to air views and express opinions. The masses said: "If we wait for the airing of views and expressing of opinions to be good, the rice fields will be eaten by the rats!" After hearing this, the cooperative committee immediately turned to rat extermination work and sent people to collect rat extermination drugs. After catching more than 600 rats, the enthusiasm of the masses rose. The airing of views and expressing of opinions continued.

Solving the problems that the masses urgently need to solve is a principle that must be followed in any political movement and mass movement, and of course it is no exception in this socialist education movement. In the early stage of the airing of views and expressing of opinions movement, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee once made improving work a separate stage of the entire movement, that is, the fourth stage of the five stages. Now it seems that to rectify agricultural cooperatives through this movement, it is impossible without such a separate stage. Without ideological education and ideological mobilization, even if some specific problems are solved, it can only be treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts. However, the specific problems reflected by the masses in the airing of views and expressing of opinions, especially the problems related to current production, life, and cadre work style, must be solved immediately, and the solution of these problems must be implemented in all stages of the entire movement. Otherwise, the enthusiasm of the poor peasants cannot be mobilized, and the goal of uniting the majority cannot be achieved. Therefore, the county party secretaries proposed to add "major changes" under the slogan of "great democracy, great debate."

According to the analysis of the meeting, there are two deviations in the current great democracy and great debate and rectifying while reforming: one is only airing views and not reforming, with the result that the movement stagnates; the other is to regard improving work as a means of airing views and expressing opinions, and then fall into the quagmire of only solving specific problems without paying attention to ideological mobilization. The Qidong Cooperative in Nanhai County aired views and expressed opinions for 40 days, but did not find out the ideological essence of the wealthy middle peasants. The reason is that the problems were not solved after two democratic rectifications of the cooperative, so the masses were not interested in airing views and expressing opinions. In this case, it is right to solve some problems that can be solved at present, but after solving several specific problems, the leaders immediately put the 13 cows of the wealthy middle peasants into the cooperative, and also put more than 40 households engaged in firecracker handicraft into the cooperative, and also fined a wealthy middle peasant 65 yuan. Although these also stimulated the production enthusiasm of the poor peasants, they did not dig out the capitalist ideology of the wealthy middle peasants, and the debate was difficult to start. This once again proves that it is not difficult to transfer the means of production of individual peasants to the collective economy of the cooperative, but it is not so easy to dig out the old roots of capitalist ideology. The Foshan Area Committee summarized everyone's opinions and believed that: rectifying while reforming at the beginning; rectifying while reforming when entering the debate; conducting systematic changes after the ideological problem is solved, which can avoid going into the specific affairs of improving work too early beyond the solution of the ideological problem.

### 要大鸣大争还要大改  广东佛山地区县委书记会议研究农村整风情况  农村社会主义阵地固若金汤经得起任何大鸣大放的风浪

    要大鸣大争还要大改
    广东佛山地区县委书记会议研究农村整风情况
    农村社会主义阵地固若金汤经得起任何大鸣大放的风浪
    本报广州5日电　记者林里报道：中共佛山地委9月28日、29日，召开了各县县委书记会议，对当前的农村大鸣大放做了检查和研究。从会上反映的材料来看，佛山专区的六千多个农业社中，已有二千四百多个展开了社会主义教育运动。进度较快的试点社和第一批开始进行社会主义教育运动的社，有的进行了四十天的鸣和放，有的开始了争和辩。大鸣大放和大争，使一度出现的农村沉闷空气走上活跃，广大农民的政治热情和生产积极性有所提高，某些“先私后公”、或“顾私不顾公”的三类社，出勤率也显著上升，区乡干部的工作热情和认识水平，也都相应地提高了。
    大鸣大放的结果证明：我们的农村工作经得起考验，农业社不怕任何风浪的冲击，不管有多少胡言乱语，社会主义的优越性是任何人也抹煞不了的。
    一个月前，当党中央和广东省委提出开展大鸣大放的办法时，佛山各地的农村工作者，包括一部分领导干部在内，对于大鸣大放能不能解决当前农村矛盾的问题是不大清楚的。就是拥护大鸣大放、并坚决执行这一方针的人，也仅只是“理论上认识了”，或者“上级叫做就做吧！”因此，运动开始并不那样顺利。人们怕放出牛鬼蛇神无法收拾，怕鸣放冲垮了农业社；直到运动走完了第一阶段，还有人担心“鸣放容易辩驳难”。经过这一月来的实践，人们的担心消除了，领导大鸣大放变成各个人的自觉行动了。会议在分析农村大鸣大放的情况时，人们一致认为当前的问题已不是敢不敢鸣，或者敢不敢放的问题，而是怎样鸣得深、怎样放得透的问题了。
    这次会议以前，人们讨论什么叫“深和透”的问题还只能说有多少多少人参加开会，有多少多少人发言。会议上则明确表示：检查深和透的主要标志，是看什么人参加了鸣和放？他鸣放出来的是什么问题？
    只有动员富裕中农鸣得深和放得透
    才能组成以贫农为骨干的辩论队伍
    各县汇报证明，要农业社的大多数人参加鸣放会议并不困难，困难的是当前农村资本主义思想的代表人——部分富裕中农也参加鸣放。没有这些人的参加，就暴露不出资本主义的本质。在鸣放过程中，这些人一般比较消极，甚至不参加会议。中山县曾调查过三个类型的乡和社：一类型的横栏乡，五十二户富裕中农中，参加会议的有三十七户；二类型的张家边，三十三户富裕中农中，有十五户参加会议；三类型的横围社，二十九户富裕中农中，参加会议的只有两户。三水县的同志说，有些社的富裕中农不但不出席开会，而且到了会也不发言，或者派老婆孩子来旁听。要动员这些人参加会议，就必须反复的讲：一、富裕中农的思想问题，是人民内部矛盾，绝对不当敌我矛盾来处理；二、不同于清算地主富农；三、不当牛鬼蛇神来打击；四、不当右派分子来斗争，不扣右派分子的帽子。横栏乡有半数以上的富裕中农参加了会议，除了大会讲政策外，还专门派干部去和富裕中农作个别谈话，启发他们鸣放。
    各地经验也证明：中农和富裕中农参加了会议，说一些干部作风不好，供销社服务态度不好的话并不难，困难的是说“真心话”。当前富裕中农的不满，一般都集中在合作化与统购统销政策上。南海县的富裕中农说：“单干加自由市场，等于猪肉加香油，肥上加肥；合作化加统购统销，等于咸菜加稀粥，越吃越没味。”顺德县的富裕中农，要“打倒两个站（粮站和收购站），取消一个社（农业社）。”新会县的富裕中农，非常怀念1953年，说那时“有四大自由”，是农民生活史上的“黄金时代”……这些话，富裕中农不愿轻易说出，而我们的农村工作者，也最怕听。有的刚刚说出个头，贫农和骨干分子就一下打了回去，结果是辩论无从开始，富裕中农不敢鸣放。顺德在这方面做得好。他们说，让富裕中农鸣放要分三个段落：放题目，放内容，放主张。就是说，他要说合作化不好，干部要耐着性子听，而且要他说出不好在哪里，要他说出主张和办法。有一个农业社，富裕中农在放出了题目也放出了内容之后，就忽然停住了，并不直截了当地提出他们的主张，他们只是转弯抹角地探听领导口气，问能不能散社。负责这个社的同志说：“你们讨论，只要70％的社员同意，领导上就批准。因为这是社章的规定。”这一说，富裕中农的尾巴翘高了，中农们的幻想也来了。他们不等干部出来，便自己布置会场，串连人来开会，并到处散布解散合作社的流言。在富裕中农积极活动的情况下，贫农急了，他们找到工作组，鼻涕一把泪一把的痛哭着：“不能啊！合作社不能散啊！”有的还说：“想不到共产党会来这一手！”鹤山县富裕中农鸣放到高潮的时候，贫农挺身而出，高声大嚷：“来，赞成合作社的站到左边，反对的站到右边，咱们辩。”当场的六十人，十九人站到了左边，其余的全都站到了右边。可是经过初步辩论以后，右边的人慢慢都转到了左边，最后右边只剩下两个人，而且都是富裕中农。其中之一的富裕中农还在坚持自己的意见，他说：
  “单干时，我吃肉穿绸，洋烟卷往嘴唇上一叼，看着你们给我干活”。这一下，连那些不觉悟的人，也都恍然大悟了，他们说：“单干就是资本主义道路，就是我们给你当牛马。不干。”富裕中农的话，给农民上了最生动、也最深刻的一课。
    根据这些，参加会议的人们认为：所谓鸣深放透，就是要放到使农业社“散社的边缘”。特别是三类社，放不到这种程度，就组织不起以贫农为骨干的辩论队伍，就挖不出资本主义思想的老根。顺德县委书记说，这个原则，不仅适用于农业社问题；而且也适用于统购统销。那里有一个社，有些富裕中农把各种购货证说成是“症”，是致“共产党于死命的症，华陀再世也治不好”。不少贫农也跟着这股歪风瞎嚷嚷。领导上为了启发贫农严肃地思考这个问题，当即对大家表示说：“大家都嫌麻烦，咱们向上级建个议，让上头把这些证件统统取消了好不好？”贫农认真考虑问题了。他们三三两两，讨论来研究去，一致的结论是“上了富裕中农的当”。他们说，要是没有了这些证件，“油盐粮布都会落到富裕中农的手里。贫农什么也买不到”。事实证明，动员富裕中农鸣得深放得透，不但可以启发贫农和下中农的阶级觉悟，彻底辩明究竟是社会主义好还是资本主义好的大是大非，同时也可以教育富裕中农放弃走资本主义道路的幻想，和贫农下中农一起坚定地走社会主义道路。
    必须打破鸣放容易辩驳难的论调
    经验证明只要放得出定能驳得倒
    在运动初期，“鸣放容易辩驳难”的论调相当普遍。这次会上也做了一个否定的回答。新会县委书记说，当前的中心问题还是鸣放，只要鸣放出来，就没有驳不倒的。因为真理是在我们这一边，他说，新会有一个社，在讨论“自由不自由”时，有人说“不准去香港经商就是不自由”。人们一听，觉得这话很对，驳不倒。后来，来了个“具体分析”，说：“谁要去香港报名，准你们去。”但是报来报去，真正要去的不足5％。“不自由”的说法，就在95％的人口中破灭了。人们继续追问：“政府准你们去，香港准不准呢？”这时，连报名要去的人也说：“是那边不准。”由此，人们得出经验说：像准不准去香港这样的问题，都能够驳倒，澄清。那就没有驳不倒的歪理。
    只有大鸣大放大争加上大改  才能充分调动群众的积极性
    大鸣大放的目的，是要弄清大是大非，解决资本主义还是社会主义的道路问题。但在运动初期，不论贫农还是中农，都会提出大量的具体问题，或者说是小是小非问题。对于这些具体问题的态度，往往是决定运动能否前进的关键。中山县龙头环社，鸣放初期人们提了好多意见，领导上没有处理，群众就说：“鸣放有什么用，干部又不听？”龙头环社刚刚遭受了一场台风，甘蔗都被打倒了，群众有顾虑，说：“不能束紧肚皮鸣放呀！”领导人听了这些，马上把群众意见集中起来，进行排队，摆出当前急于解决的问题，并把台风后的善后工作摆在第一位，由社主任和工作组带头，齐到田间去扶蔗。接着又发动了四十多个社员和三十部水车去车水。这样群众情绪起来了，说：“这才叫边整边改”。有些社没有注意这点，群众提了几百条意见，领导人还在嚷着放呀！鸣呀！结果群众回答说：“改了再放吧！”新会县中路二社的稻田里出现了鼠灾，干部却要群众鸣放，群众说：“等鸣放好了，稻田就被老鼠吃光了！”社委会听了这话，随即转向灭鼠工作，派人采集灭鼠药物，等到捉回六百多只老鼠后，群众的劲头上来了。鸣放继续进行了。
    解决群众当前迫切需要解决的问题，这是任何政治运动和群众运动中所必需遵循的原则，在这次社会主义教育运动中当然也不能例外。鸣放运动初期，广东省委曾把改进工作做为整个运动的一个单独阶段，即五个阶段的第四阶段。现在来看，要通过这次运动来整顿农业社，没有这样一个单独阶段是不行的。不经过思想教育和思想发动，纵然解决一些具体问题，也只能是头疼医头，脚疼医脚。但对鸣放中群众所反映的具体问题，特别是有关当前生产、生活和干部作风的问题，必须马上解决，并把解决这些问题，贯彻到整个运动的各个阶段，否则就不能调动贫农的积极性，也不能达到团结多数的目的。因此县委书记们提议，在“大鸣大放大争”的口号底下，再加上“大改”。
    根据会议分析，当前的大鸣大放和边整边改中存在着这样两个偏向：一是只鸣不改，结果是运动停滞不前；二是把改进工作当作了鸣放手段，又陷入只解决具体问题、而不注意思想发动的泥坑。南海县的奇东社，鸣放了四十天，没有找出富裕中农的思想本质，原因是那里经过两次民主整社，都没有解决问题，因此群众对鸣放不感兴趣。在这种情况下，解决一些当前能够解决的问题是对的，但领导者在解决了几个具体问题后，紧接着又把富裕中农的十三头奶牛入了社，把四十几户从事爆竹手工业的人也入了社，还处罚了一个富裕中农六十五元钱。这些虽也刺激了贫农的生产积极性，但并没有挖出富裕中农的资本主义思想，辩论也就很难展开。这就又一次证明，把个体农民的生产资料收归集体经济的合作社所有，并不困难，要挖掉资本主义的思想老根，却不那么容易。佛山地委综合了大家意见，认为：开始时边放边改；转入争辩时边争边改；思想问题解决后，进行系统的改，这就可以避免超越思想问题的解决而过早的钻到改进工作的具体事务中去。
