Soviet Assistance to China's Water Conservancy Undertakings
Minister of Water Conservancy, Fu Zuoyi

As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, we express our heartfelt respect to the great Soviet government and people with boundless gratitude.

Decades ago, it was the great inspiration of the Soviet October Revolution that enabled our revolutionary pioneers, amidst their distress and hesitation, to find the only correct path leading the Chinese revolution to victory. When our revolution was still in a difficult stage, our people always drew strength from the revolutionary practice of the Soviet people to arm themselves; the Soviet people gave significant support and encouragement to our revolution in both spiritual and material terms. Now, in the period of peaceful construction in our country, the Soviet people have given us generous and selfless assistance.

In the eight years from the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 to the present, China's water conservancy construction has made great achievements. Every one of these achievements is inseparable from Soviet assistance.

In 1949, the total area of irrigated land in our country was 230 million mu, accounting for 16.3% of the total cultivated land in the country. This was the total achievement of thousands of years of labor and development by our farmers. Now, the total area of irrigated land in our country has reached 520 million mu. From 1949 to 1957, the area of irrigated land increased by 290 million mu in eight years, exceeding the achievements of the past thousands of years. We have received outstanding assistance from Soviet technology in the construction of irrigation projects and the improvement of irrigation management.

Flood disasters are a serious threat to the lives of our people and agricultural production. But in 1949, except for some incomplete dikes, there were almost no large-scale modern control projects such as reservoirs and sluices on the main rivers of the country. Now, on the Huai River alone, we have built nine large reservoirs (two of which are not yet completed), sixteen lake and depression storage projects, and four large sluices that can control the mainstream of the Huai River and resist tides, and have greatly improved the flood resistance of the dikes, thus making the Huai River a river that has been largely controlled. In the process of constructing these huge projects, our engineering and technical personnel have given full play to their talents and creativity. But it must be pointed out that the reason they were able to achieve such brilliant achievements in the absence of experience is mainly because there is a technically sophisticated and experienced technical force behind them to support and help them. Whenever they encounter any difficulties, they can get kind, selfless, and mentor-like help from Soviet experts.

The Yellow River Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project officially started construction in April this year. In the eyes of the Chinese people, this is a major event that has shaken the whole country. Because the Yellow River is a world-renowned disaster-prone river, the 100 million people in the Yellow River basin have suffered from more than 1,500 breaches in more than 2,000 years. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we are going to completely eliminate the disasters of the Yellow River and use all the water of the Yellow River for irrigation, power generation, and shipping. As is well known, the technical and economic report on harnessing the Yellow River was successfully compiled with Soviet assistance, and the design documents for the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub were also entrusted to the Soviet Union. Not only that, but in order to develop the water resources of the Yangtze River, China's largest river, a large number of outstanding Soviet experts are helping us prepare a comprehensive development plan for the Yangtze River basin.

Every Soviet brother who comes to China to help us work has left an indelible impression in the hearts of our people. We think of them all the time in our lives, in our work, when problems arise, and when we celebrate success. This is not only because their technology is excellent and their help is timely, and that their hard work and wisdom are contained in the survey, design, construction, management, and scientific research of China's water conservancy undertakings, but especially because they are from a dear brotherly country, and they have a brotherly warm heart for us, and they love our country as much as their own, so they not only use their technology to help us work, but also teach us how to master these technologies ourselves. They not only help us how to build, but also help us how to save. On the occasion of celebrating the October Revolution Day, we would like to pay tribute to the great Soviet brothers!

    苏联对中国水利事业的帮助
    水利部部长　傅作义
    在庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，我们怀着无限感激的心情，向伟大的苏联政府和人民表示衷心的敬意。
    在几十年前，是由于苏联十月革命的伟大启示，使我国的革命先驱者们，在苦闷彷徨中，找见了引导中国革命走向胜利的唯一正确的道路。当我国革命还处在困难阶段的时候，我国人民总是从苏联人民的革命实践中汲取力量，来武装自己；苏联人民在精神和物质方面对我国革命给予了重大的支持和鼓舞。现在，在我国进行和平建设时期，苏联人民又给了我们慷慨无私的援助。
    从1949年中华人民共和国成立到现在八年的时间，我国的水利建设取得了伟大的成就。其中每一项成就都是和苏联的帮助分不开的。
    我国全国灌溉土地的总面积，在1949年为二亿三千万亩，占全国耕地总面积的16.3％，这是几千年来我国农民劳动开发的总的成就。现在，我国灌溉土地的总面积已经达到五亿二千万亩。从1949年到1957年，八年间增加的灌溉土地面积为二亿九千万亩，超过了过去几千年的成就。在兴修灌溉工程和改进灌溉管理方面，我们都获得了苏联技术的卓越的帮助。
    洪水灾害对我国人民生活和农业生产是一个严重的威胁。可是在1949年，在全国主要河流上，除去一部分残缺不完的堤防以外，几乎都没有大型的水库、水闸等现代化控制工程。现在，我们只在淮河这一条河上就修筑了大型的水库九座
  （其中有两座尚未完成），湖泊洼地蓄洪工程十六处，可以控制淮河干流和抵御海潮的大闸四座，并且大大地提高了堤防的抗洪能力，因而使淮河成为一条在很大程度上已被控制的河流。在修筑这些巨大工程的过程中，我国的工程技术人员们，充分发挥了自己的才能和创造力。但是必须指出，他们所以能够在缺少经验的情况下获得这样辉煌的成就，主要是因为站在他们背后有一个技术非常精湛、经验非常丰富的技术力量在支持和帮助他们，在他们遭遇任何困难的时候，都能从苏联专家那里得到亲切的无私的导师一般的帮助。
    黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程，今年4月正式开工了。这在我国人民看来，是一件震动全国的大事。因为黄河是一条世界知名的多灾的河流，黄河流域一亿人口，在两千多年间就遭受过它一千五百多次决口的蹂躏。现在，我们在共产党领导下，要彻底消除黄河的灾害，并且要把黄河的全部水流都用于灌溉、发电和航运事业。如所周知，治理黄河的技术经济报告是在苏联帮助下编制成功的，三门峡水利枢纽的设计文件也是委托苏联编制的。不只如此，为了开发我国最大河流长江的水利资源，还有一大批优秀的苏联专家在帮助我们编制长江综合开发的流域规划。
    每一个来中国帮助我们工作的苏联弟兄，在我国人民心里，都刻下了不可磨灭的面影。我们在生活中，在工作中，在发生问题的时候，在庆祝成功的时候，都时时想念他们。这不只是因为他们的技术是卓越的，他们的帮助是适时的，在我国水利事业的勘测、设计、施工、管理和科学研究等项工作中，都含有他们的心血和智慧，特别是因为他们是来自亲爱的兄弟国家，他们对我们怀着兄弟般火热的心，他们爱我们的国家正如爱自己的国家，因此他们不只是用他们的技术帮助我们工作，并且要教会我们自己掌握这些技术。他们不只是帮助我们怎样建设，并且帮助我们怎样节省。在庆祝十月革命节的时候，谨向伟大的苏联弟兄们致敬！
