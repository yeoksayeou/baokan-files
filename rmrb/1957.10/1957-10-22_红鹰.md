    During the First World War, Russia experienced a severe shortage of manpower. Tsarist Russian capitalists "imported" a large number of cheap laborers from China. According to the "News" of the Perm Governorate Soviet in July 1918, before the revolution, there were over 400,000 Chinese workers in European Russia and Siberia alone. They lived dark and miserable lives. The October Revolution brought them light. During the civil war, many Chinese people joined the Red Army and fought under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party for the Soviet regime, for freedom and liberation. In the arduous combat life, they shared life and death with the Russians and are still often remembered by the Soviet people. What is introduced here is just a fragment of their heroic struggle.
    The difficult year of 1918. The young Soviet Republic stood and fought amidst raging flames of war.

    In the spring, a team of Ural Red Army soldiers was stationed at the foot of the Irbit Mountains. One day, two Chinese men, carrying small bundles, emerged from the forest and volunteered to join the Red Army.

    "Proletarians! Miners!" they said, pounding their chests.

    "Can you shoot?" the platoon leader asked. They skillfully struck a shooting pose. It turned out they had both been soldiers in China.

    In the evening, the Sixth Company Commander, Senogosov, talked to them and finally understood: they were poor peasants in the past and had to come to Russia to work in order to earn a living; the Red Army was an army of the poor, and they wanted to join the Red Army as machine gunners. The company commander said, "You are welcome to join the Red Army, but being a machine gunner is not possible for the time being. We'll see later."

    These were the first two Chinese fighters in the renowned First Communist Peasant Detachment. Everyone affectionately called them by Russian names: one was called Vasya, and the other was called Misha.

    Once on the battlefield, they proved to be brave men. They propped their rifles on tree branches and stood to shoot, shooting very accurately. "Lie down quickly!" someone beside them shouted. They laughed and said, "It's okay! Very good!"

    The company had only one "Gott" machine gun. After the Russian machine gunner was wounded, the company commander unhesitatingly handed the machine gun over to the two newly arrived Chinese men.

    Once, the Red Army was retreating in an open area. The machine gun provided cover from behind, blocking the enemy's advance. Suddenly, the machine gun fell silent. People anxiously thought: "Damn, they've been killed." After a few minutes, the machine gun suddenly fired again. After a while, it fell silent again. The soldiers discovered that there were two beetle-like things crawling on the flat, green grass. That was Vasya and Misha. They were retreating, and in order not to expose themselves, they had to crawl on the ground. The heavy machine gun was on Vasya's back. They would crawl for a while, stop to fire a burst, and then continue to retreat. The company commander ordered them to fire at the enemy to cover them.

    Vasya and Misha returned. The soldiers cheered and lifted them into the air.

    In the summer, the Czechoslovak Legion revolted with 60,000 men, and the British, French, American, Japanese, and Italian imperialists and White Guards launched a frenzied offensive. The Soviet government declared, "The socialist motherland is in danger!" Lenin issued a call, "Worker comrades! Let us go to the final decisive battle!"

    On the Eastern Front, the fate of the revolution was being decided. Chinese workers from the Urals joined the Red Army in large numbers.

    In July, a Chinese company was formed in Perm. All 250 men were miners from Kizel. The company commander was called Liu Han Cheng (transliteration). Among the soldiers were people from Shandong, Northeast China, and Beijing. The Chinese company was stationed in the "Red Barracks," underwent two weeks of training, and then sailed east along the Kama River to join the Chinese company in Alapayevsk, forming the Chinese Internationalist Battalion, which was assigned to the regiment where Vasya and Misha were.

    ...The night of October 20th. The position was shrouded in the silence of the eve of a major battle. The peasant regiment was going to use an offensive to stop the arrogant offensive of Kolchak's bandit army.

    Dawn was breaking. Ren Fucheng (transliteration), the Chinese battalion commander in his thirties, gently walked up to Regiment Commander Oslopovsky and said, "The Chinese battalion is all ready. The White bandits are sleeping like pigs. We can start now!"

    The bugle for the charge sounded. "Urra" resounded through the earth. The cavalrymen of the Chinese battalion, wielding their sabers, rushed forward like a gust of wind. They stormed into the town of Laya from the northeast. The enemy, well-equipped and three times the size of the Red Army, was utterly defeated.

    The Red Army's victory was brilliant: the peasant regiment, with only 2,000 men, killed and wounded 1,500 bandits and captured 370 enemies.

    On October 23rd, the Soviet government ordered the peasant team to be named the "Red Eagle Regiment." On the 27th, a grand flag-awarding ceremony was held in the town of Kusva on the Dura River. All officers and soldiers of the Chinese battalion took a picture together with the regiment leaders.

    The Red Army was retreating north under extremely difficult conditions.

    In early November, the Kama River was covered with a thin layer of ice. The Chinese battalion arrived at the village of Yelovo on the riverbank. The soldiers were hungry and exhausted. At night, a rich peasant informed the enemy, and the bandit army surrounded the village from three sides. The Chinese battalion calmly faced the enemy and resisted heroically. The numerically superior enemy, relying on fierce artillery fire, pressed forward step by step, forcing the Red Army back to the river. At this critical moment, the "Ruslo" ship of the Kama River Red Fleet arrived. Russian sailors jumped ashore and charged desperately at the enemy. At dawn, the heavily wounded Chinese battalion finally broke through the encirclement together with the sailors.

    Blood stained the quietly flowing Kama River red. More than 300 people were killed in action. Battalion Commander Ren Fucheng and more than 100 soldiers were captured. They walked barefoot and barebacked in the biting cold wind for a week. Many people froze to death on the road. The survivors were taken to Tyumen in Siberia. In prison, they endured the enemy's brutal torture and maintained their unwavering heroic spirit. Battalion Commander Ren Fucheng and soldiers Chen Yusun, Wang Lianqi, Shi Zhenjiang, and others were shot. Platoon Leader Guo Laojiu was hanged alive on a tree. Half a year later, when the Red Army came, Li Xifu, Dai Liangguo (transliteration), and others were freed. As soon as they left prison, they took up arms to avenge their fallen comrades.

    Jia Chengxiang, Hou Yongshun, and a dozen other Chinese soldiers got lost in the forest after breaking out of the village of Yelovo. On the seventh day, they accidentally encountered an old woman collecting firewood. At night, she secretly led the soldiers to her home, took out all the food she had to feed them, and then took them to find the Red Army. The Red Army had gone far. Under the leadership of a Russian sailor, the Chinese soldiers formed a guerrilla team and fought behind enemy lines.

    The Red Army continued to retreat to the northern Urals. More and more Chinese workers joined the Red Army. The ranks of the Chinese battalion were constantly expanding.

    On November 30th, the "Red Eagle Regiment" was heavily surrounded in the town of Balanka. The Chinese battalion and the Putilov workers' regiment, which were resting, rushed to the rescue. After a day and night of bloody battle, the bandit army was defeated.

    On the position, a wounded Chinese man was lying unconscious. When he opened his eyes, he saw two people wrestling in a melee. So he pulled out his waist knife, gritted his teeth, and crawled forward. Blood flowed from his wound. Seeing that the Russian Red Army soldier was about to be knocked down by the enemy, he jumped up and slashed down with all his might, knocking the bandit to the ground. This Chinese man, who had lost too much blood, died in the arms of the Russian soldier.

    In this brutal battle, 335 Chinese soldiers died heroically.

    In mid-December, the bandit army approached Perm. The Chinese battalion was ordered to defend the village of Troitsa.

    Two regiments and a thousand-strong assault team of the enemy launched a frenzied offensive. The Chinese battalion had only 256 men, including six Russian soldiers. They stubbornly resisted with insufficient food and ammunition. Several enemy charges were repelled. Rows of bandit soldiers' corpses lay across the frozen Sylva River.

    On the morning of the 25th, the artillery fire subsided. In the wilderness, there was a bleak howl of a blizzard.

    After fighting fiercely with the enemy for three days and three nights, all the soldiers of the Chinese battalion died gloriously. In the end, only one wounded soldier was left. He crawled into the village at night and hid in the home of carpenter Bendekov. On the third day, he said to the carpenter, "Ivan, it's very dangerous here, I can't implicate you. All my brothers have died. I have to go, go find the Red Army!" He quietly left when Bendekov was fast asleep. Later, the carpenter discovered that this short, black-haired young man had been shot by the bandits on the roadside.

    The Chinese battalion of the "Red Eagle Regiment" thus ended its glorious road on the banks of the Sylva River.

    On the evening of the 25th, the city of Perm fell.

    The deterioration of the situation on the Eastern Front seriously threatened the fate of the Soviet state. Tens of thousands of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members rushed to the Eastern Front. On Lenin's proposal, Stalin and Dzerzhinsky were sent here.

    In the spring of 1919, the Red Army began a counteroffensive. Several teams of Chinese workers from the Urals, under the leadership of General Frunze, bravely fought the enemy. The Urals were liberated, and the heroes, following in the footsteps of the martyrs, sang the "Red Eagle Song" and marched towards Siberia:

    The red flag flutters in the wind,
    "Forward!" – the eagle calls,
    Brave songs fly high,
    Red Eagles sing for victory...

    第一次世界大战期间，俄国的人力非常缺乏。帝俄资本家从中国“输入”了大批廉价的劳动力。据1918年7月贝尔姆省苏维埃的“消息报”载，革命前，单在俄国欧洲部分和西伯利亚一带，就有四十多万中国工人。他们过着黑暗、悲惨的日子。十月革命才给他们带来了光明。内战时期，许多中国人参加了红军，在布尔什维克党的领导下，为苏维埃政权、为自由和解放而战。在艰苦的战斗生活里，他们和俄国人同生死，共患难，至今还被苏联人民常常想起。这里介绍的，只是关于他们英勇斗争的一个片断。
    艰难的1918年。年青的苏维埃共和国在熊熊的战火里屹立着，战斗着。
    春天，一队乌拉尔的红军，驻守在依尔贝特山下。有一天，从森林里走出两个背着小包袱的中国人，志愿加入红军。
    “无产者！矿工！”他们拍着胸脯说。
    “会打枪吗？”排长问。他们熟练地作了个射击的姿势。原来，他们在中国都当过兵。
    晚上，六连长塞诺戈索夫跟他们谈话，好容易才弄明白：他们过去是贫苦的农民，为了挣一口饭吃，不得不到俄国来作工；红军是穷人的队伍，他们想参加红军，当机关枪手。连长说：“欢迎你们参加红军，可是，当机关枪手暂时还不行。以后再看吧。”
    这是威名远震的第一共产主义农民团队里最初的两个中国战士。大家亲切地用俄罗斯人的名字称呼他们：一个叫瓦夏，一个叫米沙。
    一上战场，他们就表现出是勇敢的人。他们把步枪架在树杈上，站着打，打的很准。“快躺下！”旁边人喊道。他们笑着说：“没关系！很好！”
    连里只有一架“戈特”式机枪。俄国机枪手受伤以后，连长毫不犹豫地把这挺机枪交给了新来的两个中国人。
    有一次，红军在开阔地带上退却。机枪在后面掩护，阻挡着敌人的进攻。突然，机枪沉默了。人们焦急地想：“糟了，他们被打死了。”过了几分钟，机枪忽然响了起来。一会儿，又沉默了。战士们发现，在平坦的绿油油的草地上，有两个像甲虫一样的东西蠕动着。那就是瓦夏和米沙。他们在向后撤，为了不暴露自己，只得在地上匍匐爬行。沉重的机枪架在瓦夏的背上。他们爬一会，停下来开一阵火，又继续向后撤。连长命令向敌人开火，来掩护他们。
    瓦夏和米沙归来了。战士们欢呼着，把他们举在空中。
    夏天，捷克军团六万人叛乱，英、法、美、日、意帝国主义和白卫军猖狂进攻。苏维埃政府宣布：“社会主义祖国在危急中！”列宁发出号召：“工人同志们！我们去作最后的决战呵！”
    东方战线上，决定着革命的命运。乌拉尔的中国工人成批地参加了红军。
    7月，在贝尔姆城成立了中国连。二百五十人全是来自吉塞尔的矿工。连长叫刘汉成（译音）。士兵中间，有山东人，东北人，北京人。中国连驻扎在“红色营房”里，进行了两个星期的训练，然后，乘船沿卡马河东上，同阿拉巴耶夫斯克的中国连会合，组成了中国国际主义营，被编在瓦夏和米沙所在的那个团里。
    ……10月20日夜。阵地上笼罩着大战前夕的寂静。农民团要用进攻来阻止气焰万丈的高尔察克匪军的进攻。
    天将破晓。三十来岁的中国营营长任福成（译音），轻轻走到奥士洛波夫斯基团长跟前，说道：“中国营一切都准备好了。白匪睡得像猪一样。可以开始啦！”
    冲锋号吹起。“乌拉”声震动大地。中国营的骑兵健儿，挥舞着马刀，像一阵风，疾驰向前。他们从东北方冲进了拉雅镇。装备优良、人数三倍于红军的敌人，被打得落花流水。
    红军的战果辉煌：只有两千人的农民团，毙伤匪军一千五百人，俘敌三百七十人。
    10月23日，苏维埃政府下令，将农民团队命令为“红鹰团”。27日，在杜拉河畔的库斯瓦镇，举行了隆重的授旗仪式。中国营全体官兵和团首长一起照了像。
    红军在极端困难的条件下，向北退却。
    11月初，卡马河结着一层薄冰。中国营开到河畔的叶洛沃村。战士们又饿又乏。夜里，富农给敌人报信，匪军从三面把村子包围了。中国营沉着应战，英勇抵抗。人数众多的敌军，仗着猛烈的炮火，步步进逼，把红军压退到河边。在这万分危急的时刻，卡马河红色舰队的“鲁斯洛”号轮船开到了。俄罗斯水兵们跳上岸来，奋死向敌人冲去。黎明，受了重大创伤的中国营终于和水兵一起杀出了重围。
    鲜血染红了静静流着的卡马河。三百多人阵亡了。营长任福成和一百多战士被俘。他们在刺骨的寒风中，光背赤脚走了一星期。许多人在路上冻死了。活着的人被解到西伯利亚的丘缅城。在监狱里，他们忍受了敌人的严刑拷打，一直保持着坚贞不屈的英雄气概。营长任福成和战士陈玉孙、汪连启、师镇江等人被枪杀，排长郭老九被活活在树上吊死。半年以后，红军打过来，李希富、戴良国（译音）等人才获得自由。他们一出监狱，就拿起武器去为死难的战友复仇。
    贾成祥、侯永顺等十几个中国战士，从叶洛沃村冲出来以后，在森林里迷了路，第七天，才偶然碰到了一个拾柴的老太太。夜里，她把战士们偷偷领到家里，拿出所有的食物给他们吃，然后带着他们去找红军。红军走远了。中国战士们在一个俄罗斯水兵的领导下，组成了一支游击队，战斗在敌人后方。
    红军继续向乌拉尔北部退却。越来越多的中国工人加入红军。中国营的队伍在不断扩大。
    11月30日，“红鹰团”在巴朗卡镇陷入重围。正在休整的中国营和普梯洛夫工人团火速赶去营救。经过一昼夜的血战，匪军被打垮了。
    阵地上，一个负伤的中国人昏昏沉沉地躺着。等睁开眼的时候，看见有两个人扭成一团正在肉搏。于是他拔出腰刀，咬着牙，向前爬去。血从他的伤口里涌出来。眼看俄罗斯红军士兵要被敌人摔倒了。他一跃而起，猛地一刀砍下去，把匪徒砍倒在地上。这位流血过多的中国人，躺在俄罗斯战士的怀里，死了。
    在这场残酷的战斗里，三百三十五个中国战士壮烈牺牲。
    12月中旬，匪军向贝尔姆城逼近。中国营奉命坚守在特罗依察村。
    敌军两个团和一个千人的突击队，发动了疯狂的进攻。中国营只有二百五十六人，其中有六个俄罗斯士兵。他们在粮弹不足的情况下，顽强地抵抗着。敌人的几次冲锋都被打退了。冰冻的塞尔瓦河上横着一排排匪军的尸体。
    25日早晨，炮火沉寂下来。原野上，一片暴风雪的凄厉的嚎叫声。
    中国营的将士们，和敌人恶战了三天三夜之后，全都光荣牺牲了。最后，只剩下一个负伤的战士。他夜里爬进村，躲在本德科夫木匠的家里。第三天，他对木匠说：“依凡，这儿很危险，我不能连累你呀。弟兄们都牺牲了。我得走，找红军去！”他趁本德科夫熟睡的时候，悄悄走掉了。后来木匠发现，这个身材不高的黑发青年，被匪徒们枪杀在路边。
    “红鹰团”中国营，就这样，在塞尔瓦河畔，结束了它的光荣的道路。
    25日晚，贝尔姆城陷落了。
    东线形势的恶化，严重地威胁着苏维埃国家的命运。成千上万的共产党员、共青团员，奔赴东方战线。根据列宁的提议，斯大林和捷尔任斯基被派到这里。
    1919年春天，红军开始反攻。几支乌拉尔中国工人的队伍，在伏龙芝将军的率领下，勇猛杀敌。乌拉尔解放了，英雄们又踏着烈士的血迹，高唱着“红鹰之歌”，向西伯利亚挺进：
    红旗迎风招展，
    “前进！”——鹰在召唤，
    勇敢的歌声飞扬，
    红鹰们为胜利歌唱……（附图片）
    这是“红鹰团”中国营的战士和苏联红军的团首长于1918年在库斯瓦镇的合影，它是中苏两国人民战斗友谊的最珍贵的史料之一。照片上的中国战士们，在保卫苏维埃政权的战役中，光荣地献出了他们的生命。
