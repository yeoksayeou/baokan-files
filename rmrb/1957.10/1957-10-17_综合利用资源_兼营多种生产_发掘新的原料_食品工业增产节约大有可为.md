　　Comprehensively Utilize Resources, Diversify Production, Discover New Raw Materials
    Great Potential for Increased Production and Economy in the Food Industry

    (Reported by our correspondent Hu Daoyuan) Several fundamental problems currently exist in the food industry: demand for products exceeds supply; raw material supply is strained and cannot meet the needs of production development; production is uneven, resulting in significant waste of equipment and labor. A recent symposium held by the Ministry of Food Industry identified several effective solutions to these problems. These solutions are: comprehensively utilize resources, diversify production, and discover new raw materials.

    The symposium placed great emphasis on the comprehensive utilization of resources. Representatives believed that the vast majority of raw materials in the food industry are agricultural and livestock products, and the cost of raw materials accounts for a large proportion of the total cost. In the cost of sugar, alcohol, and other products, raw material costs account for more than 60%-70%. However, in food industry products, the proportion of main products is small, while the proportion of by-products is large. One hundred catties of soybeans yields only a little more than ten catties of oil, but more than eighty catties of soybean cake; the amount of by-products from wine is even greater than the amount of raw materials. Therefore, how to comprehensively utilize resources and maximize the role of by-products is of great significance to the food industry. Experiences shared at the symposium demonstrated that some by-products that were previously used directly as feed or fertilizer can be processed into more, better, and more popular mixed feed for farmers; some can even be reprocessed into food; some that were previously treated as waste can be used to extract valuable industrial raw materials. For example, in the first half of this year, Baoying Winery in Jiangsu Province used more than 590,000 catties of distiller's grains, plus by-products from the grain department - bran, wheat bran, and rice husks - to produce more than 1.58 million catties of mixed feed. Shanghai Maochang Egg Factory utilized the residual protein in eggshells to make dry protein for industrial use, increasing its income by more than 45,000 yuan last year. Shenyang Brewing Factory uses recovered carbon dioxide to make baking soda, and it is estimated that it can produce 300 tons this year. Luda Cannery uses fruit cores and peels to make jam, which can replace sugar as a pastry filling. In addition, using cold-pressed soybean cake to make tofu, using peanut cake to make defatted peanut flour and peanut butter, using fish heads and shrimp shells to make soy sauce, and using wheat tips and wheat chaff to make maltose are all good ways to comprehensively utilize resources.

    The symposium pointed out that food industry production is greatly affected by agricultural raw materials and is highly seasonal. Egg factories generally only produce for four or five months each year; sugar factories often have half a year of downtime. At the same time, the sales of some products are also affected by the season, such as candy and white wine having small sales in summer, while beer and soda have large sales in summer. The seasonality of production prevents the full utilization of equipment and labor in the food industry, which is a major problem in food industry production. To change this situation, many local food factories have adopted the method of diversifying production. For example, Sangyuan Egg Factory in Hebei also produces pickled Chinese cabbage, Tongxian Egg Factory also produces dehydrated vegetables, and Yangzhou Oil Factory also produces feed. Representatives believed that this method can solve the problem of uneven production, reduce the waste of downtime and idling, and create more wealth for the country.

    To solve the problem of insufficient raw material supply in the food industry, many food industry departments in various regions have recently put forward the slogan of "going to the mountains and the sea to find new raw materials" and vigorously developing woody raw materials and mountain resources. This year, Shanxi Province has discovered 22 kinds of wild oil-bearing materials, including papaya seeds, locust seeds, and elm seeds, with oil content generally above 10%, and the highest reaching 54%. The province plans to purchase more than 2,500 tons this year, which can produce more than 200 tons of oil. In 1956, Liaoning Province discovered more than 20 kinds of wild wine-making materials, such as acorns, grass seeds, and hawthorns, and it is estimated that the province can produce 70,000 to 80,000 tons of these raw materials each year. According to estimates by the Supply and Marketing Bureau of the Ministry of Food Industry, the nation will purchase about 100,000 tons of acorns this year for brewing alcohol (including some drinking wine). According to statistics from the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, a total of 250 kinds of wild oil-bearing materials have been discovered nationwide, of which 81 have been tested and their uses have been determined; for wild wine-making materials, acorns alone can produce about 4.6 million tons nationwide each year. As long as one-third is purchased and processed, the quantity of wine and alcohol produced will be equal to the national production plan for this year. In addition, many regions have also paid attention to utilizing the by-products of grain and non-staple food processing departments, such as using rice bran and corn germ to extract oil, and using sugar residue to make alcohol.

    The symposium believed that the above three methods are the fundamental ways to increase production and economy in the food industry. At the meeting, representatives from eight provinces and cities, including Tianjin, Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan, extensively exchanged experiences in these areas. The representatives are all confidently preparing to return and vigorously promote these methods.

### 综合利用资源　兼营多种生产　发掘新的原料  食品工业增产节约大有可为

　　综合利用资源　兼营多种生产　发掘新的原料
    食品工业增产节约大有可为
    本报讯　记者胡道源报道：食品工业生产中目前存在着几个带根本性的问题：产品供不应求；原料供应紧张，不能满足生产发展的需要；生产不均衡，设备和劳动力都有很大的浪费。最近食品工业部召开的一次座谈会，找出了解决这些问题的几项有效办法。这些办法是：综合利用资源，兼营多种生产，发掘新的原料。
    座谈会对综合利用资源的问题十分重视。代表们认为，食品工业绝大部分原料都是农牧产品，原料的价格在成本中所占的比重很大，糖、酒精等的成本中，原料费都占60％—70％以上。但是食品工业的产品中，主产品所占的比重小，副产品所占的比重大。一百斤大豆，产油不过十多斤，产豆饼却有八十多斤；酒的副产品甚至比原料的数量还大。因此，如何综合利用资源，使副产品发挥更大的作用，对食品工业具有重大的意义。座谈会上交流的经验证明，有些一向直接用做饲料、肥料的副产品，经过加工，可以制成更多更好更受农民欢迎的混合饲料；有的还可以复制食品；有些一向当作废品处理的，可以提制贵重的工业原料。例如江苏宝应酒厂今年上半年用五十九万多斤酒糟，加上粮食部门的副产品——皮糠、麦麸和统糠，制成了一百五十八万多斤混合饲料。上海茂昌蛋厂利用蛋壳内残留的蛋白制工业用的干蛋白，去年一年就增加了四万五千多元的收入。沈阳酿造厂利用回收的二氧化碳做小苏打，预计今年可以生产三百吨。旅大罐头厂利用果核、果皮做果酱，可以代替砂糖做点心馅。此外，如用冷榨豆饼做豆腐，用花生饼做脱脂花生粉和花生酱，用鱼头、虾皮做酱油，用麦稍、麦毛做饴糖，用豆饼做酱油等，都是综合利用资源的好办法。
    座谈会指出：食品工业的生产，受农业原料的影响，具有很大的季节性。蛋厂一般每年只生产四、五个月；糖厂也常常有半年的停产时间。同时，有些产品的销售也受季节的影响，如糖果、白酒夏季销路小，啤酒、汽水夏季销路大。生产的季节性，使食品工业的设备和劳动力不能充分利用，是食品工业生产中一个重大的问题。为了改变这种状况，许多地方的食品工厂采取了兼营多种生产的办法。例如，河北桑园蛋厂兼营冬菜，通县蛋厂兼产脱水蔬菜，扬州油厂兼营饲料等。代表们认为，这种办法可以解决生产不均衡的问题，减少停工、窝工的浪费，为国家多创造财富。
    为了解决食品工业原料供应不足的问题，最近期间，各地许多食品工业部门都曾提出“上山下海寻找新原料”的口号，大力开辟木本原料和山区资源。山西省今年发掘到的野生油料，就有木瓜子、槐树子、榆钱子等二十二种，一般含油率都在10％以上，最高的达到54％。全省今年计划收购二千五百多吨，可以生产二百多吨油。辽宁省1956年发现野生酒料——橡子、草子、山里红等二十多种，估计这些原料全省每年可出产七、八万吨。据食品工业部供销局估算，今年全国收购用以酿造酒精（包括部分饮用酒）的橡子，将达十万吨左右。据全国供销合作总社统计，全国已经发现的野生油料共有二百五十种，其中经过化验已确定用途的有八十一种；野生酒料，仅橡子一项，全国每年就约可出产四百六十万吨，只要收购加工三分之一，就可以生产出数量同今年全国生产计划相等的酒和酒精。另外，许多地区还注意利用了粮食和副食品加工部门的副产品。如用米糠和玉米胚芽榨油，糖渣制酒精。
    这次座谈会认为，上述三项办法，是食品工业增产节约的根本途径。会上，天津、北京、河北、山西、辽宁、山东、江苏、河南等八个省市的代表，广泛地交流了这些方面的经验。代表们都满怀信心地准备回去大力推广。
