Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: TASS, Moscow, 5th dispatch: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered to the Japanese Embassy in Moscow the Soviet government's reply to the Japanese government's note suggesting that the Soviet Union cease testing nuclear weapons and thermonuclear weapons.

The Japanese government's note was delivered to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 2. The note repeated previous suggestions to the Soviet government regarding the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, etc.

The Soviet government's reply pointed out that with the United States and Britain continuing to test various atomic and hydrogen weapons on an ever-increasing scale, the Soviet Union, considering the security of its own country, cannot unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing.

The reply emphasized that the Soviet government has consistently and firmly advocated the conclusion of an agreement with Western countries on the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing. Such an agreement can be concluded immediately, as long as the United States and Britain agree.

The reply suggested that appeals calling for a cessation of testing should be sent to the US and British governments, which are still obstructing an agreement on this issue.

    苏联政府复照日本政府
    停止核试验取决西方国家
    只要美英同意即可缔结有关协定
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联外交部把苏联政府对日本政府建议苏联停止试验核武器和热核武器的照会的复照，交给了日本驻莫斯科大使馆。
    日本政府的照会是在9月2日送交苏联外交部的。这个照会重复了以前向苏联政府提出的关于停止试验核武器等的建议。
    苏联政府的复照指出，在美国和英国继续试验各种原子武器和氢武器，而且规模日益扩大的情况下，苏联考虑到自己国家的安全，不能单方面停止核武器试验。
    复照着重指出，苏联政府多年来一直坚决主张就立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题同西方国家缔结协定。只要美英两国同意，立刻就可以缔结这种协定。
    复照建议，关于要求停止试验的呼吁书应当发给还在继续阻挠就这个问题达成协定的美英两国政府。
