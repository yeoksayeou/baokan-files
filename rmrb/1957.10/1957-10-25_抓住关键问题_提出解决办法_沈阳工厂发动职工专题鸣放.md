Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd -- Employees in most state-owned factories in Shenyang are currently conducting special topic airing of views focused on key enterprise issues.

When the large-scale airing of views by employees in Shenyang factories and enterprises reached a high point in early October, the leadership of most state-owned factories, such as the Shenyang Screw Factory, Fan Factory, Mining Machinery Factory, and Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Passenger Car Repair Factory, summarized and organized the problems exposed during the airing of views. Some identified key issues facing the enterprises and proposed preliminary solutions, which were then presented to employees for further airing of views. The leadership of the Shenyang Screw Factory is gradually presenting six special topics to employees: streamlining organizational structure, improving the organization and leadership of competitions, improving leadership style, and improving living welfare. While employees of the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Passenger Car Repair Factory were exposing waste phenomena through large-scale airing of views, the leadership organized special personnel to conduct in-depth inspections of waste and sent people to learn from fraternal factories' experiences. When the airing of views needed to be further deepened, the leadership proposed preliminary suggestions such as overcoming waste, catching up with advanced levels, and reducing costs by 30% to 36%, guiding all employees to focus their airing of views on the key enterprise issues that concern them most.

Conducting special topic airing of views focused on key enterprise issues enables employees to actively identify causes and propose solutions with a clear objective, resulting in deeper and more thorough airing of views. During the large-scale airing of views at the Shenyang Screw Factory, issues related to the management structure only revealed phenomena such as overstaffing and a bloated management structure. After the leadership proposed the special topic of merging nineteen sections into nine sections and merging eight workshops into seven workshops, employees, during the special topic airing of views, proposed: abolishing the management organizations of the tool workshop and the repair workshop, retaining the tool section and the equipment and power section, and directly leading the original work sections of the two workshops, so as to facilitate contact with relevant parties and better serve the main production workshops. Now, the factory has adopted the employees' opinions, determined and announced a plan to streamline the organizational structure, merging nineteen sections into eleven sections, and merging eight workshops into five workshops, reducing management personnel by 50.5%. After the implementation of this plan, labor productivity can be increased by 15% to 20%.

    抓住关键问题　提出解决办法
    沈阳工厂发动职工专题鸣放
    新华社沈阳23日电　沈阳大部分国营工厂职工正在围绕企业关键问题展开专题鸣放。
    沈阳市工厂企业职工大鸣大放到10月上旬已经形成高潮。当鸣放急需深入一步的时候，沈阳螺钉厂、扇风机厂、矿山机器厂、皇姑屯机客车修理工厂等大部分国营工厂的领导方面，便把鸣放暴露出来的问题进行了归纳整理，有的从中找出企业的关键问题，提出解决的初步办法，然后再让职工进一步鸣放。沈阳螺钉厂领导方面正在向职工陆续提出：紧缩组织机构、改进竞赛组织领导、改进领导作风、改进生活福利等六个专题。皇姑屯机客车修理工厂领导方面，在职工大鸣大放揭发浪费现象的同时，就组织专人深入检查浪费，并且派人到兄弟工厂去学习经验；在职工鸣放需要深入的时候，领导方面就提出：克服浪费，赶上先进水平，降低成本30％到36％的初步意见，把全厂职工引向他们最关心的企业关键问题上来鸣放。
    围绕企业关键问题展开专题鸣放，可以使职工有目标地积极找原因、想办法，鸣放得更深更透。沈阳螺钉厂职工大鸣大放的时候，对管理机构问题，只是揭发一些人浮于事、管理机构臃肿等现象。领导方面提出把十九个科室合并成九个科室，把八个车间合并成七个车间的专题以后，职工在专题鸣放时主张：取消工具车间和修配车间的管理组织，保留工具科和设备动力科，直接领导两个车间原有工段，以便同有关方面联系工作，这样能更好地为主要生产车间服务。现在，这个厂已经吸取职工们的意见，确定并且宣布了紧缩组织机构的方案，把十九个科合并成十一个科，把八个车间合并成五个车间，减少管理人员50.5％。这个方案实现以后，劳动生产率可以提高15％到20％。
