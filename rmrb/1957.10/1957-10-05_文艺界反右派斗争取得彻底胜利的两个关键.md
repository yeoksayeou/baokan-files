Two Keys to Achieving Complete Victory in the Anti-Rightist Struggle in Literary and Art Circles

To achieve a thorough and complete victory in the anti-Rightist struggle on the literary and art front, one key must be grasped: the continuous overcoming of the Right-leaning sentiments and leniency of certain leading cadres, especially leniency towards Rightists within the Party. The contradiction between us and the Rightists is an enemy-versus-friend contradiction, and our struggle with the Rightists is an antagonistic life-or-death struggle. Leniency towards Rightists is cruelty towards the working people. We should treat Rightists within the Party the same way as we treat Rightists outside the Party. If we are lenient towards them, it shows that we not only have Right-leaning sentiments ourselves, but also serious sectarianism—regarding our Party as having interests separate from the interests of the people and the interests of socialism. We must fully understand the serious significance of the Party Central Committee's instruction that Rightists within the Party are more dangerous than Rightists in society. Hasn't the recent struggle in literary and art circles most clearly illustrated this point? Didn't anti-Party elements such as Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, Jiang Feng, and Zhong Dianfei most viciously attempt to seize the command headquarters from within the Party in order to usurp the Party's Marxist leadership over the entire literary and artistic world? Of course, while overcoming Right-leaning sentiments, we must also be careful to prevent the tendency to broaden the scope of attack and to be simplistic and crude.

To achieve a complete and thorough victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, another key must be grasped: adhering to reasoned criticism, first and foremost clarifying the major issues of right and wrong in politics. True gold fears no fire, and truth fears no debate. Truth is on our side, and the broadest masses are on our side. We have nothing to fear. We should conduct reasoned criticism with the highest degree of confidence, launch free debate, and thoroughly expose and thoroughly criticize Rightists inside and outside the Party, so that they are completely isolated among the masses, and at the same time the broad masses of literary and art workers and the masses are given a vivid, concrete, and profound education. We must thoroughly discredit the Rightists, that is to say, we must enable the broad masses, including the Leftists and centrists, to fully see the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and deeds of the Rightists from this debate and criticism, and fully understand the reactionary and criminal nature of these words and deeds, and more consciously and closely unite around our Party. If we can achieve a complete and thorough victory in such a great struggle, then the victory itself will mean a great victory for our Party on the literary and art front. At the same time, it will create extremely favorable conditions for us to strengthen the Party's leadership in the literary and art circles in the future.

    文艺界反右派斗争取得彻底胜利的两个关键
    为要取得文艺战线上反右派斗争的彻底的和完全的胜利，有一个关键必须抓住，那就是继续不断地克服某些领导骨干的右倾情绪和温情主义，特别是对于党内右派的温情主义。我们和右派的矛盾是敌我矛盾，我们和右派的斗争是对抗性的你死我活的斗争。对右派分子的温情就是对劳动人民的残忍。我们对待党内右派分子应该和党外右派分子一视同仁，如果对他们有所姑息，那就说明我们自己不但有右倾情绪，而且有严重的宗派主义——把我们的党看作在人民利益和社会主义利益之外别有什么利益的狭隘的宗派。我们必须充分体会党中央所指示的党内右派比社会上的右派更加危险的严重意义。文艺界最近的斗争不是最清楚地说明了这一点么？丁玲、冯雪峰、江丰、钟惦棐等反党分子不是最凶恶地企图从党的内部来攻占指挥部，以便篡夺整个文学艺术界的党的马克思主义的领导权么？当然，在克服右倾情绪的同时，我们也要注意防止打击面过宽和简单粗暴的偏向。
    为要取得反右派斗争的完全的和彻底的胜利，还必须抓住另一个关键，那就是坚持说理批判，首先辩明政治上的大是大非。是真金就不怕火炼，是真理就不怕争辩。真理是在我们这一边，最广大的群众是在我们这一边。我们无所畏惧。我们应该怀着最高度的信心进行说理批判，展开自由辩论，对党内党外的右派，进行彻底的揭露和彻底的批判，使他们在群众里面完全孤立起来，同时使广大的文艺工作者和群众得到生动、具体和深刻的教育。我们必须把右派分子斗透，这就是说，必须使广大群众，包括左派和中间派在内，都能从这场辩论和批判中，充分地看清右派的反党、反人民、反社会主义的言行，并且充分地了解这种言行的反动性和罪恶性，而更加自觉地和紧密地团结在我们党的周围。这样一场伟大的斗争如果我们能够取得完全的和彻底的胜利了，那么，这个胜利的本身就意味着我们党在文艺战线上的巨大的胜利，同时，它将为我们今后加强党在文艺界的领导，创造极其有利的条件。
