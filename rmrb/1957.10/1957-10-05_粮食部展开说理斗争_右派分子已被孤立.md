    The Ministry of Food Deploys Reasoning Struggle
    Rightist Elements Have Been Isolated
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Over the past three months, the Ministry of Food has held various meetings to conduct in-depth exposure and criticism of more than twenty rightist elements, including Zhang Naiqi, Pan Xuede, Chen Minju, and Wei Yingqian. Through these struggles, rightist elements have been isolated, the masses have brightened their eyes, and their awareness has been raised. In the early stages of the anti-rightist struggle, some people carried burdens because they had made erroneous statements during the blooming and contending period or sympathized with rightist remarks. Others could not bring themselves to be harsh, and still others were skeptical of the anti-rightist struggle. As a result, they often remained silent during meetings. Now, these masses in the middle have recognized the ugly faces of the rightist elements, distinguished between right and wrong, and are actively trying to find ways, collect materials, and participate in the anti-rightist struggle. For example, Wu Xuecheng had made some erroneous statements during the period of great blooming and contending, and he adopted a wait-and-see attitude after the anti-rightist campaign began. Later, with the education and help of the organization, especially when others criticized the fallacies of the rightist elements by comparing the old and new societies, he recalled the suffering he had endured during his vagrant life in the old society and recognized the beauty of today's life. Therefore, he unloaded his burden and actively joined the battle.

    粮食部展开说理斗争
    右派分子已被孤立
    本报讯　三个月来，粮食部曾经经过各种会议，对章乃器、潘学德、陈民驹、韦应谦等二十多个右派分子进行了深入的揭发和批驳。通过这些斗争，右派分子被孤立了，群众擦亮了眼睛，觉悟提高了。在反右派斗争初期，有些人因在鸣放中发过错误言论，或同情过右派言论背着包袱，有的则撕不开情面，有的还对反右派斗争采取怀疑态度，因而开会时往往一言不发。现在，这些处于中间状态的群众已认清了右派分子的丑恶面目，辨别了大是大非，主动想办法，搜集材料，参加了反右派斗争。如吴学成在大鸣大放时期曾发表过一些错误言论，反右派开始后他采取观望态度。后来在组织上的教育帮助下，特别是在别人以新旧社会的对比来批判右派分子的谬论时，他回想到自己在旧社会过流浪生活所受的痛苦，认清了今天生活的美好，因此卸下包袱，积极投入了战斗。　（新华社专稿）
