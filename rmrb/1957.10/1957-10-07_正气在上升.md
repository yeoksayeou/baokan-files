Righteousness is Rising
By our reporter Huang Xiangqing

In the past few months, I have been in rural Guangdong and have deeply felt the striking difference in the ideological changes that have taken place in some of our township and commune cadres.

As recently as May and June, in Hua County, I heard some township and commune cadres expressing low morale and a lack of enthusiasm. In Xiangshan Commune, one cadre even said that he would give sixty yuan to anyone willing to take his place. The director of Langzhong Commune also sighed and lamented, "The commune members are becoming increasingly unreasonable, and it's becoming more and more difficult to be a cadre. In two years, if our house catches fire, we won't even expect the commune members to come and help!" It turned out that an evil wind was rising in their commune, with voices spreading such sentiments as, "The government is strangling the grain supply, and the peasants are neither able to eat their fill nor starve to death!" and "The cooperative is not free; being a commune member is worse than being a hired laborer." In a few places, such as Langxi Commune in Tanbao Township, there were even incidents of commune directors being surrounded and abused. The backs of these township and commune cadres were not quite straight. They did not understand where the evil wind came from, nor did they hear clearly who was shouting, but they vaguely and generally felt that the peasants were becoming estranged from the Party! The leadership work of the commune was becoming more difficult day by day.

In fact, even in such townships at that time, if one observed calmly, one would know that things were not quite as they seemed. There was an incident: a cadre with a coercive style clashed with a commune member, and the commune member, in anger, grabbed a pitchfork and pointed it at the cadre. However, at this critical moment, the commune member did not actually strike, but said angrily, "If it weren't for the Communist Party's kindness, I would really beat you up!" Once, I chatted with an old woman in Yahu Commune. I asked her about her opinions on the commune and the cadres, and she said to me, "If it weren't for the commune, if it weren't for these cadres going up the mountains and down the rivers, neglecting food and sleep, working day and night, we wouldn't have survived last year's drought!" Then she added indignantly, "However, one kind of rice nourishes a hundred kinds of people. No matter how good, there will always be people who speak ill of it. Don't pay attention to those people!" Although these were just fragments of what I saw and heard, you can appreciate how deep the influence of our Party is among the peasant masses, and how firmly rooted it is!

After Hua County launched socialist propaganda and education, the situation changed. The method of education was to analyze the situation specifically, first to make these cadres see clearly and clear their minds.

Take Langzhong Commune, where the commune director felt that "the commune members are becoming increasingly unreasonable." The cadres analyzed the situation of each commune member, and the result was: among the 164 poor peasant commune members, 148 supported socialism and obeyed orders, accounting for more than 80% of the poor peasant class; only 17 were mischievous, including 2 released criminals, 3 bad elements who had been under control, 5 idlers who did not engage in honest work, and 7 who were dissatisfied with the reality. Among the 18 middle peasant commune members, 16 held a neutral attitude, saying on the one hand that the Communist Party's politics were good, but on the other hand that they felt they were being strangled too tightly economically; only 2 were seriously dissatisfied with the Party, one of whom was a former rich peasant who had been downgraded to a middle peasant, and the other who had previously opened gambling dens and lent money at high interest rates. Among the 41 original landlords and rich peasants, except for 2 who were relatively honest on the surface, the rest were generally extremely reactionary. This situation is representative. When the cadres of Enping County held a meeting, the result of their analysis was: 65% of the peasants in the county actively supported the Party and resolutely followed the Party on the socialist road, 29% were willing to take the socialist road but were still a little hesitant, and only a very small number of original landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and individual wealthy middle peasants opposed the Party and opposed socialism. Langxi Commune, after analyzing the situation, discovered that those who surrounded and abused the commune director were only a small handful of former reactionary party members who missed the Kuomintang.

But why were some poor peasants also shouting "the present is not as good as the past" and "not enough grain"? After analysis, the cadres also understood that some of them were influenced and echoing others, and some had developed rich peasant ideology. For example, Huang Jintang, a poor peasant in Tanbao Township, Hua County, used to beg for food before liberation, but now he eats white rice every meal, but he still shouts "not as good as before," saying "in the past, begging for food was enough to eat, but now the grain is restricted." In Baiqing Township, Xinhui County, the per capita grain ration in the Sixth Cooperative was 600 jin, but they still shouted that it was not enough to eat. Upon inspection, it was found that 123 out of 273 households had more than three baskets of old grain stored.

As a result, the cadres suddenly realized! They said, "After cooperation, we only saw commune members as a whole, but we did not see that there are various different commune members with different ideas." They saw where the strength lay and realized that the majority of the masses could be relied upon. At the same time, they also realized that it was necessary to first raise the class consciousness of the basic masses and let them wake up from their confusion.

How to educate the masses? The method in Tanbao Township, Hua County, was to guide them to recall and compare: When did people starve to death? When were there more beggars and sellers of children? When were there more people wearing tattered clothes? When did more people in the village go to school? Who did they pay rent to before liberation, and what was it used for? Who do they give grain to now, and what is it used for? What are the differences in national construction before and after liberation? etc. During the discussion in Xintai Cooperative, 97 poor peasant households totaled up: before liberation, 14 people in the village starved to death, 15 sold their children, 4 begged for food, 70 households ate wild vegetables to get through the lean months, 8 fled famine, 5 were beaten to death for stealing due to poverty, and 17 went bankrupt in the old society because they learned to smoke opium and gamble. But now? Not only does every household have food and clothing, and medicine when they are sick, but all the children of the poor peasants can go to school, and 11 have already entered middle school. Xu Xing, a poor peasant, said, "Before liberation, my family had no food to eat, I sold two daughters, and my husband starved to death. After liberation, I turned over and joined the cooperative. Even with years of natural disasters, we still have food to eat, but now I am still so ideologically confused. I am really forgetting my roots after turning over!" As they talked, they gradually uncovered the truth: it turned out that those who took the lead in complaining and making trouble were all landlords, rich peasants, and those who had served as puppet township chiefs and speculative merchants, as well as upper-middle peasants who wanted to "get rich on their own." Therefore, the peasants all said, "We must not be fooled again in the future, and we must fight against the bad guys who are destroying our cooperatives."

After educating the masses, many agricultural cooperatives exposed the conspiracies and destructive words and deeds of landlords carrying out counter-attacks. As a result, those who incited trouble were isolated; some peasants who had asked to withdraw from the cooperative did not withdraw; and those who had withdrawn returned. In Chaoyang County, for example, not only did more than 13,000 households who had withdrawn from the cooperative return, but 355 individual households also joined the cooperative. In Shichuan Township in this county, the 13 cooperatives that had collapsed were restored, and 2 new cooperatives were built, absorbing 256 individual households.

The peasants whose awareness has been raised are so determined to safeguard the interests of the cooperative and fight against the destroyers. In many agricultural cooperatives in Chenghai County, not only did the commune members refute reactionary fallacies with fervor and emotion in large meetings attended by hundreds or thousands of people, but some commune members also fought against those with ulterior motives at any time and in any place. Once, in the threshing ground of Fenjiao Cooperative in this county, the wife of the former puppet township chief Chen Qimei deliberately sighed in a low and strange voice, "Alas! It's more miserable now than before! We women have to work ourselves to death just like men!" She fully expected to elicit the approval of the women working together, but before she could finish speaking, she was surrounded by the women. Hong Wu's wife, a poor peasant, said angrily, "Who is like you, the township chief's grandmother, who doesn't work and eats exploitation?" The other women also chimed in, refuting the township chief's grandmother until she couldn't lift her head.

The above is just the situation in some townships and cooperatives on the eve of the large-scale debate in the countryside! Currently, cadre meetings are being held throughout the province to prepare to lead the masses in a large-scale debate. Judging from the situation in these townships and cooperatives in the past, we have full confidence in achieving a complete victory in this debate.

    正气在上升
    本报记者　黄向青
    近几个月来，记者在广东农村的所见所闻中，深深感觉前后迥然不同的是我们的一些乡社干部在思想上所发生的变化。
    还在6、7月间，在花县，我听到有些乡、社干部情绪低落，劲头不高。象山社就有一个干部这样表示：谁愿替他当干部，他宁愿给谁六十块钱。塱中社的主任也曾唉声叹气地说：“社员愈来愈不像话，干部愈来愈难当，再过两年，我们家里失火，也不用希望社员来救啦！”原来，在他们的社里，正上升着一股邪气，社里在传播着这样的声浪：“政府卡死粮食，农民吃不饱饿不坏！”“合作社不自由，当社员不如当长工，”等等。有个别地方，如炭保乡塱西社，还发生社主任被包围喝打的情事。这些乡社的干部腰干儿有点直不起来。他们不明白邪气从何而来，也没听清叫嚷的都是谁，只模糊地笼统地感到：农民同党疏远了！社的领导工作一天难似一天。
    其实，在那时候，即使是在这样的乡里，如果冷静地观察一下，就会知道并不是那么回事。曾发生过这样一件事：一个有强迫命令作风的干部跟一个社员闹翻了，这个社员在气愤之下，抓起禾杈对着干部。但是，在这一触即发的当儿，社员并没有真地干起来，只气冲冲地说道：“要不念共产党的恩情，真会揍你一顿。”有一次，我在鸭湖社跟一个老婆婆扯谈。我问她对社和干部们的意见，她这样对我说：“如果不是有了社，不是这些干部上山下河、不顾吃、不顾睡、白天黑夜地干，我们过不了去年的旱灾！”接着又愤愤地说：“不过嘛，一种米养百样人，再好，也有人讲坏话。那些人，管他干吗！”虽然这仅仅是片断的见闻，你可以体味出，我们党在农民群众中的影响是多么深厚，扎下的根是多么地牢固！
    花县开展了社会主义宣传教育后，局面改观了，教育的办法是具体分析情况，首先使这些干部们擦亮眼睛，清醒头脑。
    就以那个社主任认为“社员愈来愈不像话”的塱中社来说吧。干部们对每一个社员的情况进行了分析，结果是：在一百六十四户贫农社员当中，拥护社会主义服从指挥的，就有一百四十八户，占贫农阶层的80％以上；调皮的只有十七户，其中二户是释放犯，三户是曾被管制过的坏分子，五户是不务正业的二流子，七户是对现实不满的。在十八户中农社员中，有十六户是抱着中间态度的，他们一方面说共产党政治好，一方面觉得在经济上对他们卡得太死；只有二户对党严重不满，其中一户是富农降为中农的，一户是过去开设赌摊和放高利贷的。在四十一户原地主、富农中，除二户表面比较老实外，其余的一般都极为反动。这情况是有代表性的。恩平县干部开会时分析的结果：全县农民有65％积极拥护党、坚决跟党走社会主义道路，有29％愿意走社会主义道路但仍有点犹豫，只有极少数原地主、富农、反革命分子和个别富裕中农反对党反对社会主义。塱西社，他们经过情况分析，就发现了包围喝打社主任的只是那一小撮怀念国民党的原来的反动党员。
    但是，为什么也有些贫农在叫喊“今不如昔”，叫喊“粮食不够”呢？经过分析，干部们也明白了：他们中的一些人是受到影响跟着嚷嚷的，一些人则是富农思想有了发展。比如花县炭保乡贫农黄金棠，解放前讨吃，现在顿顿白米饭，可是他也喊“比不上从前”，说“过去讨饭也吃得饱，如今粮食受限制”。新会县百顷乡六社每人粮食六百斤了，但还喊不够吃。经检查，在二百七十三户中，就有一百二十三户都留有陈粮三箩以上。
    这样一来，干部们恍然大悟了！他们说：“合作化以后，眼睛里只看见一律都是社员，却没有看到有各种不同的社员，不同的思想”。他们看到了力量的所在，认识了大多数群众是可以依靠的。同时也认识了必须首先提高基本群众的阶级觉悟，让他们从迷惑中清醒过来。
    怎样对群众进行教育呢？花县炭保乡的办法是引导他们回忆对比：什么时候饿死人？什么时候讨饭的多、卖儿卖女的多？什么时候穿破穿烂的多？什么时候乡里读书上学的人多？解放前交租给谁，用来做什么？现在交粮给谁，用来做什么？解放前后国家建设有什么不同？等等。这个乡新太社九十七户贫农在讨论的时候一凑：解放前村里饿死的就有十四人，卖儿卖女的十五人，讨饭求乞的四人，有七十户吃野菜过荒月，八户逃荒，有五人因迫于贫困偷东西而被打死，还有十七人在旧社会因学会抽大烟、赌博而致倾家荡产。而现在呢？不但家家户户吃上饭穿上衣，病了有药吃，而且全部贫农的子弟都能上学读书，有十一个已读上中学了。贫农许杏说：“解放前我家没饭吃，卖了两个女儿，丈夫又饿死了，解放后翻了身，入了社，连年天灾，也有饭吃，可现在还是那么思想糊涂，真是翻身忘本！”谈着谈着，就逐渐揭开了真相，原来带头叫苦闹事的，都是地主　富农以及当过伪乡保长、投机商人的那一路货，还有就是想“单门发财”的上中农。于是，农民们都说：“往后不要再上当，要跟破坏我们社的坏家伙作斗争”。
    经过对群众进行教育，许多农业社揭发了地主进行反攻倒算的阴谋和破坏言行。于是，煽动闹社的也被孤立起来了；有些曾经要求退社的农民，不退了；退了的，又回来了。以潮阳县来说，这时期，不但有一万三千多户退了社的回了社，还有三百五十五户单干户新入了社。这个县石船乡垮了的十三个社恢复了，另还新建两个社，吸收了单干户二百五十六户。
    觉悟提高了的农民，是那么坚决地为维护社的利益同破坏者作斗争。澄海县许多农业社社员，不但在几百人、成千人参加的大会上，慷慨激昂地驳斥反动谬论，有些社员还随时随地同不怀好意的人进行斗争。有一次，在这个县凤窖社的晒谷场上，原来的伪乡长陈其梅的老婆故意阴声怪气地自叹道：“唉！现在比以前惨呀！我们妇女家也得跟男人一样劳死！”她满以为可以引起一同干活的妇女们的附和，那晓得，话还未了，就被妇女们包围起来了。贫农宏武嫂气愤地冲她说：“谁跟你这乡长奶奶一样，不劳动，吃剥削。”其他妇女也七口八舌，直把个乡长奶奶驳得抬不起头来。
    以上这些，还是农村里大规模展开辩论前夕，一部分乡、社的情况呢！目前，全省各地正在召开干部会议，准备领导群众进行大辩论。从过去的这些乡、社的情况看来，我们完全有信心在这次辩论中取得全胜。
