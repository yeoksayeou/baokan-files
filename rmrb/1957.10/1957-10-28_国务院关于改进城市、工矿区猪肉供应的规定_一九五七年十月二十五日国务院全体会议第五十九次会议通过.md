    Regulations of the State Council on Improving Pork Supply in Cities and Industrial and Mining Areas
    Passed at the 59th Plenary Meeting of the State Council on October 25, 1957

    In order to stabilize the market, meet the needs of people in cities and industrial and mining areas for pork, rationally adjust the supply standards for workers, cadres, and urban residents, and strengthen the relationship between the Party and the People's Government and the masses, the following regulations are now made regarding the pork supply issue in cities and industrial and mining areas:

    I. The supply standards for urban residents shall be determined independently by the People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality based on the availability of goods. The central government will not issue unified regulations on whether or not it is necessary to adopt a system of rationed supply with tickets (or certificates). Each locality may decide on its own based on specific circumstances. In cities where pork is rationed with tickets (or certificates), beef and mutton needed by ethnic minorities should also be rationed with tickets (or certificates), and the quotas shall be determined by each locality based on local conditions.

    II. The pork required by cadres and workers of government agencies, organizations, schools, factories, and mines shall be supplied according to the same standards as urban residents, regardless of rank or position. Any special supply methods that existed in the past should be abolished. However, collective catering units such as government agencies, organizations, military units, schools, and factories may raise pigs for self-sufficiency if conditions in the urban area are suitable and grain conservation is not affected, and with the approval of the municipal and county People's Committees. State-operated units will not purchase the pigs they raise, but may allow the breeding units to slaughter and consume them themselves. The tax payment method will be the same as for farmers raising pigs for self-slaughter and consumption, and their entitled supply amount should not be reduced as a result.

    III. Pork used by the processing and replicating industry and the catering industry shall be examined and supplied in a fixed amount based on the need to maintain business operations appropriately and in conjunction with the availability of goods. Urban catering businesses that have the conditions and have obtained approval from the county and municipal People's Committees to raise pigs shall be treated in the same manner as collective catering units raising pigs.

    IV. The pork required by the military shall be calculated and supplied at a standard of no more than an average of 1.5 jin per person per month for the entire army. Within this supply amount, the Ministry of National Defense shall separately stipulate the supply standards for officers and soldiers of each branch of the armed forces. The pork required by family members of military officers shall be supplied according to the same standards as urban residents.

    V. Appropriate consideration may be given to the pork required by personnel engaged in high-temperature, high-altitude, underground, and underwater operations, as well as hospital patients and postpartum women, under the principle of slightly higher than the supply level for general urban residents. The specific supply quotas shall be determined independently by the People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality.

    VI. The pork required for foreign guests, foreign envoys, foreign experts, and banquets for foreign guests shall be guaranteed according to actual needs.

    VII. These regulations shall take effect on December 1st.

    国务院关于改进城市、工矿区猪肉供应的规定
    一九五七年十月二十五日国务院全体会议第五十九次会议通过
    为了稳定市场，适应城市、工矿区人民对猪肉的需要，合理调整职工、干部和市民的供应标准，密切党和人民政府同人民群众的关系，现在对今后城市、工矿区的猪肉供应问题作如下规定：
    一、市民供应标准，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会根据货源情况，自行规定。各地是否需要采取凭票（或凭证）定量供应办法，中央不作统一规定。各地可以根据具体情况自行决定。凡实行凭票（或凭证）定量供应猪肉的城市，少数民族需要的牛羊肉也应该实行凭票（或凭证）定量供应，其定额由各地根据当地情况自行规定。
      二、对机关、团体、学校、厂矿、企业的干部和职工所需猪肉，不分级别和职别，一律比照市民标准供应。过去如有特殊供应办法的，应该取消。但是，机关、团体、部队、学校、工厂等集体伙食单位，在适合城区和不影响节约粮食的条件下，并且得到市、县人民委员会的批准，可以养猪自给，国家经营单位对他们所养的猪不予收购，可留给饲养单位自宰自食，其纳税办法与农民养猪自宰自食同，并且不能因此而减少其应得的供应量。
    三、对加工复制业和饮食业用猪肉，根据适当维持营业需要，并且结合货源情况，加以审核，定量供应。城市饮食业有条件并且得到县、市人民委员会批准养猪的，应该与集体伙食单位养猪的办法同样对待。
    四、对军队所需猪肉，按全国部队每人每月平均不超过一点五市斤的标准计算供应量，在这个供应量内，由国防部另行规定各兵种官兵的供应标准。对部队军官家属所需猪肉，一律比照市民标准供应。
    五、对高温、高空、井下、水底作业人员和医院病员、产妇所需猪肉，可在略高于一般市民供应水平的原则下予以适当照顾，具体供应定额由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会自行规定。
    六、对外宾、外使、外籍专家和宴请外宾的宴会所需猪肉，根据实际需要，保证供应。
    七、本规定自十二月一日起实行。
