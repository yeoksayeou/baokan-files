　　I Also Talk About Writing Reform
　　Li Fenglian

　　Workers and peasants in the old society did not have the opportunity to receive education. Only when the Communist Party came and the people took control of the government, did the working class and peasantry become masters of their own destiny in economics and politics, and then had the possibility of turning over culturally as well. Especially after the national liberation, the Party and the government tried everything possible to improve the cultural level of workers and peasants. Writing reform is an extremely important measure to improve the culture of workers and peasants. During the period of the Great Debate, right-wingers also launched vicious attacks on writing reform, which is intolerable. I would like to talk about writing reform from my own personal experience, first to refute the right-wingers with the fact that simplified Chinese characters have a huge effect on improving the culture of workers and peasants.

　　In 1934, when I was just thirteen or fourteen years old, I joined the revolutionary work in my hometown of northern Shaanxi. At that time, I couldn't even write my own name. I followed my comrades in learning culture in the gaps between guerrilla warfare. Once, I wrote the "帝" (dì) character in "Japanese imperialism" (日本帝国主义), and I couldn't write it out even after a whole morning. I cried bitterly myself and resolved to learn culture well. At that time, the leading comrades told us revolutionary principles, and we could understand everything we heard, but we couldn't remember it firmly. I thought to myself, how great it would be if I could write it down in a notebook and flip through it at any time! Learning a Chinese character, from recognizing it to writing it, to being able to use it, is a hard labor process. Especially for characters with dense strokes, it is okay to learn to recognize them, but it is really not easy to write them correctly. The comrades who studied with me all had a headache as soon as they saw characters with many strokes. Like the characters "華" (Huá), "曅" (yè), "農" (nóng), and "學" (xué), when you encounter them for the first time, your eyes are simply dazzled. I remember that the "黨" (dǎng) character in "Communist Party" (共产黨) and the "鳯" (fèng) character in my name took a long time to learn well. These two characters always had to be written when filling out registration forms. The first time I filled out the form myself, I wrote the "黨" character for more than ten minutes. The "鳯" character was even more difficult to write, either missing arms and legs, or putting the strokes on the left to the right. The difficulty in learning and using Chinese characters, especially traditional Chinese characters, hinders the rapid improvement of cultural level, which cannot but affect the work. I remember that when Shenyang was just liberated in 1949, I went to the Shenyang Clothing Factory to give a report to the workers, introducing the deeds of the model worker Zhao Zhankui. I had thought about the content in my mind beforehand, and I was afraid that I would not speak well temporarily, so I planned to write a speech outline. However, I was not able to do what I wanted, and I could not write it out. As a result, the report was not so organized and did not achieve the desired effect. In 1950, I accepted the study task given to me by the Party and was fortunate to enter the preparatory course of the Renmin University of China, and began to study culture regularly. At that time, although I had already recognized a lot of characters, I still felt difficulties in learning. Especially when listening to teachers' lectures, I didn't know how much time I would have to spend to record important words, so I couldn't concentrate on listening to the lectures. It was also difficult to copy notes from the blackboard: characters with dense strokes always exceeded the grid when writing, and the denser the strokes, the more time it took. Often others have finished copying, and they are still tracing one stroke at a time. Students from worker and peasant backgrounds have a lot to write, but they can't write it out. After studying for a period of time, I recognized some characters, but I still couldn't write them out. This situation more or less affected the learning mood of the students. I thought to myself: in the old society, I was oppressed by feudal landlords and could not study; after liberation, I had the opportunity to go to school, but because of the difficulty of Chinese characters, I still could not learn well. Some people were a little disheartened after learning for a while. When simplified characters began to be piloted in 1955, I had already left Renmin University and returned to my job. However, in my spare time cultural learning, I also felt the benefits of simplified characters. Simplified characters are simple in strokes, easy to write, and write quickly. Moreover, most of the simplified characters have already been popular in society, and do not need to be relearned. It is easy to learn for young people, and it is also easy to learn for the elderly. After learning traditional characters, they are often forgotten after a short period of time. Simplified characters are easy to remember, just like things that are in your pocket, when you want to use them, you can take them out. I often think, if the "Simplified Chinese Character Scheme" was announced a few years earlier, the time for me to learn culture would definitely be shortened.

　　I have a younger brother who farms in my hometown. He had never been to school before liberation. In 1954, the agricultural cooperation in my hometown had already entered a climax. With the development of agricultural cooperation, the peasant masses urgently demanded to learn culture. Once, my younger brother wrote to me complaining that farmers generally felt that Chinese characters were difficult to learn. He especially mentioned some commonly used characters in rural areas, such as "雜" (zá) in "coarse grains" (雜粮), "麵" (miàn) in "flour" (麵粉), "穀" (gǔ) in "grain" (穀子), "麥" (mài) in "wheat" (麥子), "農" (nóng) in "peasant" (農民), "鋤" (chú) in "hoe" (鋤头), etc., are not easy to write. He asked me if I had any good learning methods. Later, I sent him a book printed in simplified Chinese characters. He was very happy and wrote back saying, "These new characters are much easier to learn." From his later letters to me, it can be seen that his cultural level has indeed improved a lot compared to before. He also complained in the letter why I didn't send it to him earlier.

　　From these personal experiences, I deeply experienced that writing reform is absolutely necessary for the vast number of workers and peasants.

　　I also remember going to Hungary to attend the World Women Workers' Conference in 1956, where I met an Albanian female worker named Shania. When we signed each other's autographs, she asked me to learn how to write the "鳯" (fèng) character in my name. I carefully taught her stroke by stroke, but she couldn't write it out. I taught her the simplified "凤" (fèng), and she learned it in a while. I told Shania that this is a simplified character, which was simplified after liberation under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party to carry out writing reform. I also taught her to learn the simplified "东" (dōng) in "Zedong" (泽东) of Chairman Mao's name and "华" (Huá) in "China" (中华), and told her that workers and peasants are now learning simplified characters to improve culture; in the future, we will gradually implement phonetic writing. Shania listened very happily and gave a thumbs up and said repeatedly: "Mao Zedong is good, Mao Zedong is good." This example shows that foreign friends also agree with China's writing reform.

　　Right-wingers attack writing reform work and use this topic to oppose the leadership of the Party, which is fundamentally against the interests of the workers and peasants. Right-wingers are afraid that workers and peasants will improve their culture, and socialism will become more consolidated, and it will be more difficult for them to return to capitalism, so they desperately oppose it. In the words of the right-wingers themselves, that is: what the Party hates, they love; what the Party loves, they hate. It is very clear that whether or not writing should be reformed is actually a question of position. I am a worker, and I firmly oppose the attacks on writing reform by the right-wingers, and firmly support writing reform.

### 我也谈谈文字改革

　　我也谈谈文字改革
　　李凤莲
    工人农民在旧社会里得不到受教育的机会。只有在共产党来了、人民掌握了政权的时候，工农大众才在经济上、政治上翻身，跟着有了可能在文化上也翻过身来。特别是在全国解放以后，党和政府想尽一切办法来提高工农的文化水平。文字改革就是提高工农文化的一项极重要的措施。右派分子在大鸣大放期中，对文字改革也进行恶毒的攻击，这是不能容忍的。我想从自己的亲身体会来谈一谈文字改革，首先是简化汉字对提高工农文化有巨大作用的事实来驳斥右派分子。
    1934年，我刚十三、四岁，在家乡陕北参加革命工作。那时候，我连自己的名字都不会写。我跟着同志们在打游击的空隙里，挤时间学文化。有一次我写一个“日本帝国主义”的“帝”字，写了一个早上也没有写出来。自己痛哭了一场，下定决心要学好文化。那时候，领导同志给我们讲革命道理，听都听得懂，就是记不牢。心想，要是能记在本子上，随时可以翻翻，该多好啊！学习一个汉字，从认到写，到能用它，是一个艰苦的劳动过程。特别是笔画稠的字，学认还可以，要写正确，实在不容易。我们一起学习的同志，都是一看见笔画多的字就头痛。像“華”“曅”“農”“學”这些个字，第一次碰到它，简直眼睛都看花了。我记得，“共产黨”的“黨”字和我名字里的“鳯”字，就学了好久还没有学好。这两个字，在填写登记表的时候总得写。我第一次自己填表，一个“黨”字写了十来分钟。“鳯”字更不好写，不是缺胳膊短腿，就是把左边的笔画安到了右边。汉字，特别是繁体汉字的难学、难用，阻碍着文化水平的迅速提高，这就不能不影响到工作。记得1949年沈阳刚解放，我到沈阳被服厂给工人作报告，介绍劳动模范赵占魁同志的事迹。我事先脑子里想好了内容，怕临时讲不好，打算写一个发言提纲。可是，力不从心，总也写不出。结果，报告就不是那么有条理，没能收到应有的效果。1950年，我接受了党给我的学习任务，幸运地进了中国人民大学预科，开始正规地学习文化。那时候，虽然已经识了不少字，可是学习上还是感到困难。特别是听老师讲课的时候，为了把重要的话记录下来，不知要耽误多少时间，这样也就不能集中注意力听讲了。就是照黑板抄笔记也感到困难：笔画稠的字，写起来总是超出格子，而且笔画越稠，花的时间就越多。往往别人都抄完了，自己还在一笔一画地描。工农出身的同学们心里都有很多话想写，可就是写不出来。学了一个时期，识了些字，也还是写不出来。这种情况，多多少少影响了同学们的学习情绪。心想：在旧社会里受封建地主的压迫，学习不了；解放后有了上学的机会，却由于汉字的繁难，还是学不好。有的学着学着就有些灰心了。1955年开始试行简化字的时候，我已经离开人民大学，回到工作岗位。可是，我在业余文化学习中，同样感受到了简化字的好处。简化字笔画简单，容易写，写得快。而且简化字大都是社会上早已流行的，不用重新学习，它对年轻人来说好学，对老年人也同样好学。学了繁体字，往往过不多久又忘了，简化字很好记，就像随身装在衣兜里的东西一样，什么时候要用，什么时候就可以拿出来。我常常想，要是“简化汉字方案”早公布几年，我学文化的时间是一定可以缩短的。
    我有一个弟弟在家乡种地，解放前他也没上过学。1954年家乡的农业合作化就已经进入了高潮。随着农业合作化的发展，农民群众迫切要求学习文化。有一次，我弟弟来信诉苦说，农民在学习中普遍感到汉字难学。他特别提到农村的一些常用的字，像“雜粮”的“雜”，“麵粉”的“麵”，“穀子”的“穀”，“麥子”的“麥”，“農民”的“農”，“鋤头”的“鋤”，等等，都不好写。他问我有没有好的学习办法。后来，我寄了一本用简化汉字印的书给他。他高兴极了，回信说：“这些新字好学得多”。从他后来给我的信可以看出，他的文化程度的确比以前进步得多了。他在信中还埋怨我为什么不早些寄给他哩。
    从上面这些亲身经历，我深切地体验到，文字改革对于广大工农群众是完全必要的。
    我还记得1956年去匈牙利开世界女工会议，认识了一位阿尔巴尼亚的女工名叫沙尼娅的。当我们互相签名留念的时候，她向我学习写我的名字中的“鳯”字。我细心地一笔一笔地教，她怎么也写不来。我把简体的“凤”教给她，一会儿就学会了。我告诉沙尼娅这是简化字，是解放以后在毛主席和共产党领导下进行文字改革工作给简化的。我又教她学会了毛主席名字的简体“泽东”的“东”和“中华”的“华”等，并告诉她现在工人农民正在学习简化字，提高文化；将来还要逐步实行拼音文字。沙尼娅听了很高兴地竖起大拇指来连声说：“毛泽东好，毛泽东好。”从这个例子可以说明，外国朋友也是赞成我国的文字改革的。
    右派分子攻击文字改革工作，并且借这个题目反对党的领导，这是根本违反工农群众的利益的。右派分子恐怕工人农民提高了文化，社会主义就会更加巩固，他们要回到资本主义去就更加困难了，所以他们拼命反对。用右派分子自己的话来说，那就是：党所痛恨的，他们喜爱；党所喜爱的，他们痛恨。很明白，文字要不要改革，其实也是一个立场问题。我是工人，我坚决反对右派分子对文字改革进行的攻击，坚决拥护文字改革。
