Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th -- Seoul dispatch: U.S. Eighth Army Commander Decker admitted today that the U.S. soldiers under his command have abused their power in the continuous killing of South Koreans. However, he falsely accused all those killed of being "thieves."

Decker said at a press conference in Seoul that U.S. soldier Bailey's killing of a Korean boy in Cheongcheon on October 3 was an "overstepping of his authority in the use of his weapon." Regarding the atrocities of the U.S. Air Force base guards in Gunsan, who shot and wounded two Korean girls in mid-September, Decker also admitted that there was "no reason to shoot." However, he believes that it is "unfair" to condemn those U.S. soldiers who opened fire and killed people merely because they were carrying out the task of "preventing theft."

    南朝鲜美军司令承认美国兵乱杀人
    但诬赖被杀者是“小偷”
    据新华社平壤11日电　汉城消息：美国第八军军长德克尔今天承认，他所指挥下的美国兵连续杀害南朝鲜人有滥用武力的情形。但是，他把被杀害的人都诬称为“小偷”。
    德克尔在汉城举行的记者招待会上说，美国兵贝利10月3日在清泉杀害一个朝鲜男孩是“越权使用了他的武器”。对于群山美国空军基地卫兵在9月中旬开枪把两个朝鲜少女打伤的暴行，德克尔也承认“没有开枪的理由”。但是，他认为，对那些开枪杀人的美国兵仅仅因为他们在执行“制止盗窃”的任务而加以谴责是“不公平”的。
