Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 4th: Over the past five years, a total of 4.92 million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed in the Hexi Corridor and northern Yellow River Plain area of Gansu Province.

According to preliminary surveys, there are more than ten million mu of cultivable wasteland in the Hexi Corridor and northern Yellow River Plain. These two areas have fertile soil and abundant water sources, making them ideal locations for establishing grain and cotton production bases. As long as most of the lost water is controlled, it will be sufficient to irrigate the newly reclaimed land. In this area, land only needs to be irrigated once or twice a year to yield a good harvest. This year, Dunhuang County sowed 80,000 mu of cotton, with an average yield of 105 jin of ginned cotton per mu, which is more than double the national average yield. This year, Zhangye County's 330,000 mu of spring wheat achieved an average yield of 400 jin per mu, setting the highest record for large-scale wheat yield in the country.

Since the high tide of cooperativization at the end of 1955, Gansu Province has simultaneously launched a surge of land reclamation. In addition to reclaiming small plots of wasteland near their villages, agricultural cooperatives in various places also formed youth land reclamation teams to reclaim land in distant areas.

    河西走廊和黄河平原
    开垦荒地近五百万亩
    据新华社兰州4日电　甘肃省河西走廊和北部黄河平原地区，五年来共开垦荒地四百九十二万亩。
    据初步勘测，河西走廊和北部黄河平原上可以耕种的荒地有一千多万亩。这两个地区土质肥沃，水源充足，是建立粮棉基地的理想地区，只要把流失的大部分水控制起来，足够灌溉新垦田地。这一带的土地一年只要灌上一两次水，即能获得丰收，敦煌县今年播种的八万亩棉花，平均亩产皮棉一百零五斤，高出全国平均产量一倍以上。张掖县今年的三十三万亩春小麦，平均亩产四百斤，创造了全国小麦大面积丰产的最高纪录。
    从1955年底合作化高潮后，甘肃省同时掀起了垦荒的热潮。各地农业社除在附近开垦小片荒地外，还组成青年垦荒队到远处开荒。
