Xinhua News Agency report: Anhui, Shaanxi, and Qinghai provinces recently held special meetings to formulate water conservancy plans for this winter and next spring.

Anhui Province's farmland water conservancy project plan for this winter and next spring involves a total of 430 million to 450 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. According to the principle of "small-scale projects as the main focus, medium-sized projects as supplementary, and large-scale projects built when necessary and possible," the central task of Anhui Province's water conservancy work this winter and next spring is: drainage and irrigation, combined with crop rotation, to continue to improve and consolidate flood control capabilities, and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1958. The province plans to increase the irrigated area by 4.28 million mu next year, improve the irrigated area by 8.93 million mu, and control soil erosion over an area of 1,906 square kilometers; specific requirements have also been put forward for the main dikes of the Yangtze River and general river dikes. In order to accomplish the above tasks, local leading organs plan to vigorously utilize the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of agricultural cooperatives, and resolutely implement the principle of running water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily.

Shaanxi Province will complete the expansion of irrigation to 2.5 million mu this autumn, winter, and next spring, and has determined to focus on small-scale projects, with larger projects built when necessary. In the Guanzhong plains area, there are plans to mobilize the masses to continue digging wells, line unfinished wells, and promote waterwheels; in the Weibei Plateau area, in addition to continuing to build various original small-scale water conservancy projects, there are plans to divert water to irrigate farmland on the plateau. In the mountainous areas of northern and southern Shaanxi, there are plans to mobilize the masses to build reservoirs, ponds, dig artesian wells, and tap springs.

Farmers of all ethnic groups on the Qinghai Plateau will newly build 320,000 mu of paddy fields next year, with more than 110,000 mu to be built this winter and next spring. This number is larger than originally planned, and was proposed based on the new situation of universal improvement in the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of farmers of all ethnic groups after a major debate.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Jiangsu Province's farmland water conservancy projects for this winter started one month earlier than in previous years. The province plans to complete 500 million cubic meters of earthwork this winter and next spring. Among them, small-scale farmland water conservancy projects relying on mass mobilization account for 400 million cubic meters, which is 2.3 times the amount of work done last winter and this spring. More than 4 million laborers across the province will be invested in water conservancy projects.

After the completion of the water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, the province will increase the irrigated area by 3.55 million mu, of which more than 2.8 million mu can be converted to rice cultivation. Over 7 million mu will have improved irrigation conditions and increased yields. Nearly 20 million mu of low-lying, flood-prone farmland will be gradually freed from internal flooding disasters. It is estimated that the province will increase grain production by nearly 2 billion jin due to improved water conservancy conditions.

    安徽陕西青海江苏及早动手
    订出兴修水利计划
    新华社讯　安徽、陕西、青海三省最近召开了专门会议，制订了今冬明春的兴修水利计划。
    安徽省今冬明春农田水利工程计划共做土石方四万三千万到四万五千万公方。根据“小型为主，中型为辅，必要和可能的兴建大型工程”的方针，安徽省今冬明春水利工作的中心任务是：排涝灌溉，结合改种，继续提高和巩固防洪能力，争取1958年农业大丰收。这个省计划在明年增加灌溉面积四百二十八万亩，改善灌溉面积八百九十三万亩，控制水土流失面积一千九百零六平方公里；对长江干堤和一般江堤也提出了具体要求。为了完成上述任务，各地领导机关计划大力发挥农业社的人力、物力和财力，并且坚决贯彻勤俭办水利的原则。
    陕西省今年秋冬和明春要完成扩灌任务二百五十万亩，并且确定以兴修小型为主，必要时兴修一些较大的工程。在关中平川地区计划发动群众继续打井，掏箍半成井和推广水车；渭北高原区除继续兴修原来的各种小型水利工程外，计划引水到高原灌溉农田。陕北和陕南沿山地区计划发动群众修水库、水塘、打自流井和掏泉。
    青海高原各族农民将在明年新修水田三十二万亩；今冬明春修十一万多亩。这个数字比原来计划大，是根据各族农民经过大辩论，社会主义觉悟和生产情绪普遍提高的新情况提出的。
    据新华社南京电　江苏省今冬的农田水利工程比往年提前一个月动工。全省计划今冬明春要完成土方工程五亿立方公尺。其中依靠发动群众兴修的小型农田水利占四亿公方，等于去冬今春工程量的二点三倍。全省将有四百多万劳动力投入兴修水利的工程。
    今冬明春的水利工程完工后，全省将增加灌溉面积三百五十五万亩，其中有二百八十多万亩可以改种水稻。能改善灌溉条件、增加产量的有七百多万亩。近两千万亩低洼易涝的农田将能逐步免除内涝灾害。全省因水利条件改善估计能增产粮食近二十亿斤。
