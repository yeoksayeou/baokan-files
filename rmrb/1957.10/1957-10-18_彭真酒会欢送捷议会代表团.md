Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen held a reception at the Beijing Hotel tonight to bid farewell to the Czechoslovak National Assembly delegation headed by Chairman Fierlinger and the Prague Central People's Committee delegation headed by Mayor Svoboda.

Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Bušiňák, was also invited to attend the reception.

Mayor Peng Zhen said in his speech at the reception that the simultaneous visit of the two Czechoslovak delegations to China has not only further deepened the mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples, but also helped to strengthen the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the lofty cause of safeguarding world peace. He said that the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples have a deep brotherly friendship, and the thoughts of Marxism-Leninism and the common cause of socialism closely link the two peoples together.

Peng Zhen said that under the wise leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the brave Czechoslovak people have built their motherland into a socialist country with a highly developed industry. The Chinese people are very happy and encouraged by the brilliant achievements of the Czechoslovak people in the cause of socialist construction. Peng Zhen expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Czechoslovak government and people for their consistent support for the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and their sincere assistance to China's construction.

Mayor Svoboda then spoke. He said that the Czechoslovak people have long been concerned about the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and socialist construction after the revolutionary victory, and the Czechoslovak people regard every revolutionary victory and construction achievement of the Chinese people as their own victory and achievement. In his speech, he also warmly congratulated the Chinese people on the smooth completion of the first, second, and even more five-year construction plans, making new and greater contributions to consolidating the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Chairman Fierlinger spoke in a very excited tone about the very deep impression that this visit to China left on them. He expressed the hope that he could visit China again when the second five-year plan is nearing completion, at which point the entire hall burst into lasting applause, expressing a warm welcome. Chairman Fierlinger then said that at that time, People's China would surely see even more astonishing progress. Chairman Fierlinger also hoped that more Chinese friends would visit Czechoslovakia to deepen the brotherly friendship between the two peoples.

Accompanying the guests at the reception tonight were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, and Chen Shutong, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, heads of various departments of our government, democratic parties, and people's organizations, as well as Vice Mayors of Beijing and representatives from all walks of life in the capital.
