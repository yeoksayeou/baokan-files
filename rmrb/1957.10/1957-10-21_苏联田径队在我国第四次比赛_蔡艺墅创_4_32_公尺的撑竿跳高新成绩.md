    Soviet Track and Field Team's Fourth Competition in China
    Cai Yishu Sets New Pole Vault Record of 4.32 Meters
    (Our newspaper reports) Yesterday afternoon, the Soviet track and field team held a friendly competition with the track and field team of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education at the track and field field of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education. This was their fourth competition in our country. Some athletes from our national track and field team also participated in the performance. A total of twenty events were held yesterday, with Soviet athletes participating in six events and winning first place in all six. Our athlete Cai Yishu cleared 4.32 meters in the pole vault competition, breaking the 1956 national record of 4.20 meters, and exceeding his own score of 4.30 meters created in Moscow in July of this year by two centimeters.
    The pole vault was the most exciting event of yesterday's competition. The participants included Blatov from the Soviet Union and Cai Yishu, Zhang Changfa, and four other athletes from our country. When the crossbar was raised to 4.10 meters, only Blatov and Cai Yishu remained. They both cleared 4.10 meters and 4.20 meters. The crossbar was raised to 4.32 meters. Cai Yishu had never cleared this height before, but this time he cleared it easily on his first attempt. Passing 4.32 meters marked the birth of a new achievement, and people congratulated him with cheers and applause. When attempting 4.40 meters, Blatov cleared it, but Cai Yishu failed three times.
    The women's high jump began, and the high jump frame became the focus of the audience's attention. Zheng Fengrong cleared the crossbar without any difficulty in several jumps, starting from 1.45 meters up to 1.70 meters. The audience repeatedly encouraged her with applause. When the crossbar was raised to 1.75 meters, she failed three times because she slowed down in the last few steps of her run-up.
    In yesterday's competition, Soviet athletes Sitkin, Matveyev, and Sokolov won first place in the high jump, discus, and 1,500-meter races with scores of 2.08 meters, 51.19 meters, and 3 minutes 57.4 seconds, respectively. Soviet sprinter Paraskeyev won first place in the 100-meter and 200-meter races with times of 11 seconds and 22 seconds, respectively.
    Premier Zhou Enlai watched yesterday's competition. He met with Pugachev, the leader of the Soviet track and field team, and Zheng Fengrong, and encouraged Zheng Fengrong to work hard and achieve good results. (Attached picture)

    苏联田径队在我国第四次比赛
    蔡艺墅创4.32公尺的撑竿跳高新成绩
    本报讯  昨天下午苏联田径队在北京体育学院田径场同北京体育学院田径队举行了一场友谊比赛，这是他们在我国的第四次比赛。我国家田径队部分运动员也参加表演。昨天共举行了二十项比赛，苏联运动员参加了六项，并取得了六项比赛的第一名。我国运动员蔡艺墅在撑竿跳高比赛中，跳过了四公尺三十二公分。打破了四公尺二十公分的1956年全国最高纪录，比他本人今年7月在莫斯科创造的四公尺三十公分的成绩还高出二公分。
    撑竿跳高是昨天比赛中最精采的一个项目。参加比赛的有苏联的布拉托夫和我国的蔡艺墅、张长发等六名运动员。当横竿升到四公尺一十时，只剩下布拉托夫和蔡艺墅。四公尺一十、四公尺二十，他们都跳过去了。横竿升到了四公尺三十二公分。蔡艺墅过去一直没有跳过这一高度，这次第一次跳他就轻快地跳过去了。过了四公尺三十二，又一个新成绩诞生，人们以欢呼和鼓掌来向他祝贺。在跳四公尺四十公分时，布拉托夫跳过去了，蔡艺墅三次都没有过去。
    女子跳高开始了，跳高架成了观众们的视线的焦点。郑凤荣从一公尺四十五公分起到一公尺七十公分的几次跳，她都毫无困难地越过了横竿。观众一再用掌声鼓励她。当横竿升到一公尺七十五公分时，因为她跑的后几步慢了，三次都失败了。
    在昨天的比赛中，苏联运动员西特金、玛特维耶夫、索科洛夫分别以二公尺○八公分、五十一公尺十九公分和三分五十七秒四的成绩取得了跳高、铁饼和一千五百公尺比赛的第一名。苏联短跑运动员帕拉斯克耶夫分别以十一秒和二十二秒的成绩取得一、二百公尺比赛的第一名。
    周恩来总理观看了昨天的比赛。他接见了苏联田径队领队普加乔夫和郑凤荣，并勉励郑凤荣，努力创造好成绩。（附图片）
