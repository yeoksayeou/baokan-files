In the "Rural University"
My Experiences Returning to Rural Grassroots Work and Participating in Labor
Liu Zhimao, Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Zhongjiang County Committee, Sichuan Province

I was originally born and raised in the countryside, but after leaving school and joining revolutionary work, I gradually became detached from productive labor. This January, responding to the call of the Party, I returned to the grassroots to do rural work and participate in productive labor. In these six months or so, I have preliminarily felt that going to the countryside is the happiest, most joyful, and most promising thing to do.

From 1953 to 1956, for three or four years, although I was nominally engaged in rural work, I actually spent more than half of my time sitting in the office. The situation at that time was: I knew a little bit about book knowledge, but it was not deep or thorough; I knew a little bit about agricultural cooperatives, but it all came from reports and telephone reports from below, and I had very little specific knowledge; I said I was close to the masses, but in reality, when I met peasants, I spoke like a student, and after three sentences, it became cold and indifferent. Therefore, the work assigned by the Party organization was not done well, and I felt depressed, feeling that rural work had no future, no prospects, and I wanted to transfer or go to school.

Since the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee put forward the call to "go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the masses, work hard and be thrifty, and improve work style," with the help of the Party and comrades, I thoroughly examined my ideology and work style. At the mobilization meeting for spring plowing and production this January, I volunteered to go to the countryside, and after being approved by the Party group, I participated in the actual work of the CPC Jexing Township General Branch.

After participating in the actual work, my life was no longer special, and I basically managed to blend in with the masses and grassroots cadres. In the past, I rode a big horse to the countryside and asked someone to carry my bag; now I walk more to the countryside and carry my own bag more; in the past, when I went to the fields, I picked up my hands and turned them around, and my leather shoes and uniform looked very special; now I wear cloth clothes and straw sandals, and I participate in production whenever I have time; in the past, no matter how far away I was from the township, I had to return to the township to live, but now I live in whichever cooperative I work in. On the first day I arrived in the township, I participated in winter production; on the third day, I stayed in the home of Wu Zhongyong, a poor peasant in the Gaoshan Cooperative, the farthest from the township where cadres rarely stayed in the past. Eating and living together, I was a little unaccustomed to it at first, but after a few days, I got used to it. Working with the cooperative members to process the land, I also had difficulties at first. Blisters appeared on my hands, and I was sweating profusely in the cold wind, taking off my cotton-padded jacket. Soon I got used to it. The poor peasant Wu Zhongyong said, "The Communist Party really knows how to educate cadres. The land reform cadres are back again." How happy I was to hear these words!

I have now initially developed such a habit. Every time I go to a cooperative, I visit several cooperative members, hold cooperative member forums, listen to opinions, and help the cooperative improve its work. For example, in the First Cooperative of the Sixth Village, I heard that young people did not respect the elderly and said that the elderly were "old feudalists." I then held a forum for elderly cooperative members, and the elderly put forward more than 20 opinions, such as "young people are sloppy in their work" and "play cards regardless of whether they are busy or idle." The cooperative committee adopted these reasonable opinions and educated young people to respect the elderly. As a result, the response was very good. The elderly cooperative member Lan Zhifa said, "That's right, if the elderly and young people are of one mind, then there's no need to worry about the cooperative not being run well."

The Third Cooperative of the Sixth Village of Zhixing Township (originally a third-class cooperative), last year, during the small spring pre-distribution, the grain and grass were rotten, the accounts were unclear, and the cooperative members had a lot of opinions. This year, during the small spring pre-advance, I lived in the cooperative and helped them improve their methods and improve their systems. As a result, the grain and grass did not rot, the accounts were clear, and the cooperative members were very satisfied. Recently, the cooperative members also said, "We want Old Liu to go back and help our cooperative with the big spring distribution."

In the rural university, after the tempering of actual struggle, I feel that I have improved in five aspects: ① I am more familiar with the work of the cooperative than before; ② I know more about production knowledge than before, and I have initially learned how to plant rice seedlings and transplant seedlings; ③ I am also easier to approach the masses than before; ④ I often participate in labor, exercise my body, and my weak body is also healthier than before; ⑤ The masses have a good reflection, I am in a happy mood, my mind is open, I don't carry burdens, I am focused on my work, and I have more energy.

Of course, this is only the beginning, and there are still shortcomings in my work, such as not grasping ideological work tightly enough, not studying regularly enough, etc. Therefore, I will never be arrogant or complacent, and under the guidance of the Party and the supervision of the masses, in the rural university, in the rectification movement, I will temper myself and truly settle down, take root, blossom, and bear fruit in the countryside.

    在“农村大学”里
    我回到农村基层工作并参加劳动的体会
    中共四川省中江县委农村工作部长　刘支茂
    我本来就生长在农村，但从学校出来参加革命工作以后，便逐渐脱离了生产劳动，今年1月，响应党的号召，又回到基层做农村工作，并参加了生产劳动。在这半年多的时间里，我初步感觉到：到农村去是最幸福、最快乐、最有前途的事情。
    1953年到1956年这三、四年中，我虽然名义上在搞农村工作，实际是有一半多时间在坐办公室。那时候的情况是：书本知识知道一点，但是不深不透；农业社的知识知道一点，但都是从下面的报告中、电话汇报中间得来的，具体的知识很少；嘴上说接近群众，实际上见了农民是满口学生腔，说不上三句话，就冷冰冰的了。因此，党组织分配的工作搞得并不好，自己也觉得苦闷，感到农村工作没前途，没出息，想转业，想升学。
    自从党的第八次全国代表大会和八届二中全会提出“深入基层，深入群众，艰苦朴素，改进作风”的号召后，在党和同志们的帮助下，对自己的思想作风作了彻底的检查。在今年1月春耕生产的动员大会上我便自动报名要求下乡，经党组批准后，便参加了中共杰兴乡总支部的实际工作。
    参加了实际工作后，生活上不再特殊，基本上做到了同群众、同基层干部打成一片。过去下乡骑大马，请人背背包，现在下乡走路的时间多了，自己背背包的时间多了；过去到田边把手操起转，皮鞋制服显得很特殊，现在是布衣草鞋，有时间就参加生产了；过去离乡再远也要回乡住，现在到那社工作就在那社住。到乡的第一天就参加冬季生产；第三天就在离乡最远过去很少住干部的高山社贫农伍忠用的家里住下了。同吃、同住，开头有些不习惯，过几天也就习惯了。同社员一道搞土地加工，开头也有困难，手上打起了血泡，吹着寒风，脱棉袄，也累得满头大汗。不久也就习惯了。贫农伍忠用说：“共产党真会教育干部，土改干部又回来了。”我听到这些话，心里是多么愉快啊！
    我现在已经初步养成了这样一种习惯。每到一个社里，都要访问几户社员，开社员座谈会，听取意见，帮助社里改进工作。比如，在六村一社时，听说青年人不尊重老年人，说老年人是“老封建”。我便开了个老年社员座谈会，老年人提出“青年人做活毛糙”“不管忙闲打扑克”等二十多条意见。社委会采纳了这些合理意见，教育青年人要尊重老年人。结果反映很好，老年社员蓝志发说：“这就对了，老年、青年一条心，那愁合作社办不好。”
    志兴乡的六村三社（原来是一个三类社），去年小春预分时，烂粮烂草，账目不清，社员意见很大，今年小春预支时我住在该社，帮助他们改进了办法，健全了制度，结果，粮草未烂，账目清楚，社员非常满意。最近社员还说：“要求老刘回去，帮我们社搞大春分配。”
    在农村的大学校里，经过实际斗争的锻炼，自己觉得在五方面有了提高：①对合作社的工作比以前熟悉了；②生产知识比以前懂得多了，初步学会了栽秧子，打棵子；③也比以前容易接近群众了；④常参加劳动，锻炼了体格，瘦弱的身体，也比以前健康了；⑤群众反映好，情绪愉快，思想开朗，不背包袱了，工作专心，劲头也大了。
    当然，这还只是开端，工作中也还有缺点。如思想工作抓得不够紧、学习不经常等。因此绝不骄傲自满，在党的教导下，群众的监督下，在农村的大学校里，在整风运动中锻炼自己，真正做到在农村里落户、生根、开花、结果。
