A Thought-Provoking Lesson

The "Cao Qinggong, a Wealthy Middle Peasant Who Cried 'I'm Starving!'", Grain Storage Exhibition

A thought-provoking exhibition is touring the Red Star Collective Farm in the Nan Yuan District of Beijing. On display at the exhibition is a large quantity of grain hidden by the wealthy middle peasant Cao Qinggong, some of which has already rotted. Before his "secret" was exposed, Cao Qinggong shouted every day: "I'm starving!" "I don't have cloth coupons, I'm going to be naked!" Now the truth about this "grain and cloth shortage household" has finally been revealed. After visiting the exhibition, the farm members also held in-depth discussions. Everyone received a great education.

At the discussion meeting on the "Cao Qinggong issue," rich peasant Xiao Yonghe voluntarily confessed that he had stored 2,310 jin of stale grain at home for four years. He was also someone who shouted "not enough to eat" and would rather let the grain mold and rot. (The upper right corner shows another part of his stored grain).

Farm members visiting the exhibition. On display were 800 jin of stale grain, 14 bolts of cloth, 60 new clothes, and 3 new quilts collected by Cao Qinggong.

Zhao Qingzhen has not worked a single day since joining the farm, and engages only in her private plot. After participating in the "Cao Qinggong issue" discussion, her thinking has greatly changed. This is her first time participating in farm labor, and she is telling people about her understanding.

The new farm members who have settled down in the Red Star Collective Farm, the former cadres of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, also actively participated in this great debate. They felt that the "Cao Qinggong issue" was truly a vivid course in "socialist education."

　　引人深省的一课
　　叫喊“快要饿死了”的富裕中农曹庆功存粮展览会
    一个引人深省的展览会，正在京郊南苑区红星集体农庄巡回展出。展览会上放着富裕中农庄员曹庆功隐瞒的大批粮食，有的已经霉烂了。曹庆功在“秘密”没有揭穿以前，成天叫嚷着：“快要饿死了！”“没布票，要光屁股了！”现在这个“缺粮缺布户”的家底终于被和盘托出。庄员们在参观了展览会后，还进行了深入的讨论。大家受到了很大的教育。

　　在“曹庆功问题”的讨论大会上，富农萧永和自动交代出家里存了四年的陈粮二千三百一十斤。他也是一个嚷着“不够吃”而宁愿让粮食霉掉烂掉的人。（右上角是他的另一部分存粮）。
　　庄员们参观展览会。会上陈列了曹庆功收藏的八百斤陈粮，十四匹布，做好的新衣服六十件，新棉被三床。
　　赵庆珍参加农庄后没有出过一天工，天天搞自留地。参加“曹庆功问题”讨论后，她的思想有很大转变，这是她第一次参加农庄劳动时向人说她的认识。
　　在红星集体农庄安家落户的新庄员们、原北京市商业局的干部也积极参加了这次大辩论，他们感到“曹庆功问题”真是一课生动的“社会主义教育”课程。
