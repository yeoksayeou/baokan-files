    Nearly 400 Young Pioneers in Beijing
    Meet Old Comrade Who Participated in the October Revolution
    (Our Newspaper) On the afternoon of the 19th, nearly 400 Young Pioneers from Beijing's No. 85 Middle School, No. 61 Middle School, No. 33 Middle School, and No. 77 Middle School met with Wang Hongxun, Chen Bocuan, and Ji Shoushan, old comrades who participated in the October Revolution, at the Youth Palace. The meeting began with the sound of gongs and drums. Jin Ruyi, the representative of the Young Pioneers, first delivered a speech, saying: "Who raised the first red flag in the world that will never fall? Who opened up the bright road in the dark earth? ... We must forever inherit this great cause, and let the red flag of the October Revolution fly in every place in the world where there are children...."
    The children put their red scarves on these three old comrades, making these three seventy-year-olds look younger. They told the Young Pioneers stories of their participation in the struggles of the October Revolution and the experiences of the Soviet people's arduous struggle. Ji Shoushan told the children that happiness does not fall from the sky, but is obtained by the selfless labor of the Soviet people. Although the Soviet people are now living very happily, no one has forgotten labor.
    Beijing's children will hold various activities to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in the near future. These items are: meeting with the Chinese and Soviet mixed mountaineering team members to introduce how the Soviet team members helped the Chinese team members overcome the storm and climb the glacier; meeting with Comrade Zhou Baozhong, who liberated the Northeast, to tell the story of Sino-Soviet friendship; Sino-Soviet Young Pioneers get-together; inviting Chinese children who participated in the Soviet Young Pioneers to talk about their lives in the Soviet Union, etc. (Attached picture)

    北京近四百名少先队员
    会见中国曾参加十月革命的老伯伯
    本报讯  19日下午北京市第八十五中、六十一中、三十三中、七十七中学有将近四百名少先队员，在少年宫会见中国参加十月革命的老伯伯王鸿勋、陈柏川、季寿山。会议在锣鼓声中开始了，少先队员代表金茹意首先致词说：“是谁在世界上树立起第一面永远不倒的红旗？是谁在黑暗的地球上开辟了光明的大道？……我们要永远继承这伟大的事业，让十月革命的红旗飘扬在世界各个有孩子的地方。……”
    孩子们把自己的红领巾给这三位老伯伯带上，这三位七十岁的老人也显得年青了。他们给少先队员们讲自己参加十月革命斗争的故事，讲苏联人民艰苦奋斗的经历。季寿山向孩子们说，幸福不是从天上掉下来的，是苏联人民忘我劳动取得的，苏联人民现在虽然生活得很幸福，可是谁也没有忘了劳动。
    北京市的小朋友将在最近举行多种庆祝十月革命四十周年的活动，这些项目是：和中苏混合爬山队员见面，介绍苏联队员怎样帮助中国队员战胜风暴爬上冰山；和解放东北的周保中同志见面，讲中苏友谊的故事；中苏两国少先队员联欢；请参加过苏联少先队的中国小朋友讲在苏联的生活等。（附图片）
