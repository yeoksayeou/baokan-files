Xinhua News Agency Report, October 14th: Damascus officially announced that three Egyptian destroyers carrying Egyptian troops arrived in Latakia at noon on the 13th.

According to officials in Cairo, Egyptian naval forces began visiting Latakia on the 13th.

According to the Middle East News Agency, quoting officials from the Syrian-Egyptian Joint Command in Cairo, Egyptian armed forces have been sending "basic units" to Syria since mid-September to strengthen the Syrian army and Syria's defense capabilities. This action was taken in accordance with the joint defense treaty between Egypt and Syria and the plan determined during the meeting between the commanders of the two countries in Cairo on September 11th.

The Egyptian troops received a warm official welcome upon arriving in Latakia. Residents held demonstrations and chanted slogans of Arab unity.

Syrian Army Chief of Staff Bizri, while welcoming Egyptian Army Commander Mahmoud Nashid and his troops in Latakia, said: Imperialists should now know that "Syria is not isolated, and any aggression against Syria is an aggression against all Arab people." Bizri suggested that Commander Amir of the Syrian-Egyptian Joint Forces consider October 13th, the day the Egyptian troops arrived in Syria, as a day of celebration for the two countries every year.

All newspapers in Damascus and Damascus Radio welcomed the arrival of the Egyptian troops in Syria. Damascus Radio said on the evening of the 13th, "This historical event can be regarded as the first step in the Arab nationalist effort to achieve Arab unity." The radio station said that if the imperialists rely on the Turkish army in the north and the Israeli army in the south, our joint forces will know how to defend these borders.

On the same day, Cairo's "Voice of the Arabs" radio station said on the evening of the 13th that the Egyptian troops sent to Syria have declared to the world that the destinies of Syria and Egypt are the same, and aggression against either country is aggression against the other.

Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: TASS, Damascus, October 13th: Syrian Acting Defense Minister Azem told reporters that the United States' attempts to seek and use new means to influence Syria are "a waste of effort," and that "Syria is ready to deal with any eventuality."

He said: "Due to the close unity of the people, government, and army, the imperialists' plans have been frustrated, and many of their conspiracies have been exposed. The people's awareness has been greatly enhanced, and they will never tolerate foreign interference in Syria's internal affairs."

Regarding Khrushchev's remarks to a "New York Times" reporter, Azem said: "The Soviet leader's remarks prove that there is a solid friendship between us. This conversation has also reassured our people and convinced them that Syria's fate is part of the world's fate."

　　按照埃叙条约采取行动
    埃军进入叙利亚共御侵略
    叙代理国防部长指出美国反叙是枉费心机
    本报综合报道　据新华社14日讯：大马士革官方宣布，三艘埃及驱逐舰载着埃及军队于13日中午到达拉塔基亚。
    另据开罗官方人士说，埃及海军部队从13日开始访问拉塔基亚。
    据中东通讯社援引开罗的叙—埃联合司令部官方人士的谈话说，从9月中旬起，埃及武装部队就向叙利亚派出“基本单位”以加强叙利亚军队和叙利亚的防御力量。这是按照埃叙两国的共同防御条约和两国指挥官9月11日在开罗会谈中确定的计划而采取的行动。
    埃及军队在到达拉塔基亚时受到热烈的正式的欢迎，居民们举行示威游行，并且欢呼阿拉伯团结。
    叙利亚陆军参谋长比兹里在拉塔基亚欢迎埃及军队司令马哈茂德·纳希德和他的军队的时候说：帝国主义者现在应当知道，“叙利亚不是孤立的，对叙利亚的任何侵略就是对全体阿拉伯人民的侵略。”比兹里建议叙埃联合部队司令阿密尔考虑以埃及军队到达叙利亚的日子10月13日作为两国每年庆祝的节日。
    大马士革所有的报纸和大马士革电台都欢迎埃及军队的来到叙利亚。大马士革电台13日晚说，“这个历史事件可以看作阿拉伯民族主义为实现阿拉伯团结的努力的第一步。”这家电台说，如果帝国主义者在北面依靠土耳其军队，在南面依靠以色列军队，我们的联军将会知道如何来保卫这些边界。
    同一天，开罗“阿拉伯之声”电台13日晚上说，埃及派往叙利亚的这支军队已经向全世界宣告，叙利亚和埃及两国的命运是同一的，对于其中任何一个国家的侵略就是对另外一个国家的侵略。
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社大马士革13日讯：叙利亚代理国防部长阿泽姆对记者说，美国试图寻求和使用新的手段来影响叙利亚是“枉费心机”，“叙利亚已经准备好应付任何意外”。
    他说：“由于人民、政府和军队的紧密团结，帝国主义者的计划遭到了破产，他们的许多阴谋被揭穿了。人民的觉悟已经大大提高了，他们决不容忍外国对叙利亚内政的任何干涉”。
    关于赫鲁晓夫对“纽约时报”记者发表的谈话，阿泽姆说：“苏联领导人的谈话证明在我们之间存在着巩固的友谊。这个谈话也安定了我们人民的心，并确信叙利亚的命运是全世界命运的一部分”。
