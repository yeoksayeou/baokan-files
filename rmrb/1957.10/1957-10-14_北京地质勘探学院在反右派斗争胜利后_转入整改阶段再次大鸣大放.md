Beijing Institute of Geology Transitions to Rectification Stage, Launches Another Round of Extensive Airing of Views

(Our Dispatch) The rectification movement at the Beijing Institute of Geology is forming a mass upsurge in improving work. Well-intentioned criticisms and suggestions regarding improvements in all aspects of the school's work are emerging on big-character posters like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. As of the 12th, teachers, students, and staff had posted over one thousand several hundred big-character posters containing more than three thousand eight hundred opinions.

Since August, after the school achieved a great victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, the school's rectification movement has entered the stage of rectifying while correcting. The school Party committee established working groups for teaching administration, wages and welfare, etc., to study the one hundred and thirty-five major issues raised by the masses during the extensive airing of views. It also addressed one hundred and fifteen of these issues and reported back to the masses. After the start of the new academic year, the school Party committee analyzed the situation of the school's rectification and believed that the Party committee's work in rectifying while correcting was still far from sufficient. It was necessary to mobilize the masses to offer opinions and help the Party committee improve its work. Xiao Ying, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, in a mobilization report for socialist ideological education delivered recently, explained to all teachers, students, and staff the distinction between the attacks of rightists and general well-intentioned criticisms, as well as the Party Committee's determination to rectify while correcting, which basically eliminated the concerns of the masses.

During this period, the school Party Committee's handling of several matters, such as announcing the punishments for Party members who had made mistakes, establishing a Socialist Education Reading Room within three days based on the students' opinions, and helping graduating students study international current events, gave teachers, students, and staff a clear impression that the Party Committee's determination to improve its work was great. From October 4th to 9th, they posted more than one thousand one hundred big-character posters. These big-character posters vividly reflected the increased awareness of teachers, students, and staff throughout the school, especially young students, in the anti-Rightist struggle, and fully demonstrated their strong sense of ownership regarding the school's work.

In the past few days, the newly built sheds in front of the three dining halls of the college have been filled with a dazzling array of big-character posters. Demanding improvement in teaching work is the central focus of everyone's opinions. Li Zhijiang and three others from the General Geology Teaching and Research Section, and Dong Zhen and others from the Mineralogy Teaching and Research Section, respectively suggested on big-character posters to strengthen the teaching staff for teaching practice and expressed the hope that the school would pay great attention to the annual teaching practice summaries and continuously improve the practice work. Zhao Qiyuan and three others from the Mineralogy Teaching and Research Section suggested opening a small exhibition hall at the teaching practice base to facilitate teachers' lesson preparation. Zhang Linsheng and others, students of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Mineral Geology Department, raised objections to the inappropriate allocation of this year's production practice. Many other big-character posters put forward constructive opinions on the supply of lecture notes and books, and the utilization of exhibition rooms.

Some big-character posters also exposed waste within the school and offered opinions on how to run the school diligently and thriftily. The personnel of the parts distribution workshop of the factory management section criticized the phenomenon of stockpiling machine tools in a big-character poster titled "The Eternally Sleeping Machine Tools." Liu Shangren and Zhu Ji'an suggested on big-character posters that the Party Committee link voluntary labor with the school's production and repair work. For example, organizing students to repair running tracks, basketball courts, etc.

Currently, the Party Committee of the Institute of Geology is working intensely to deal with the opinions of the masses. Each department and section has also established working groups for rectifying while correcting. Under the call of the Party Committee, "Party members take the lead, mobilize the masses, take responsibility at each level, and report on each item," each unit also attaches great importance to the opinions of the masses. Shortly after many big-character posters were posted, many of those who were criticized or the relevant responsible units posted big-character posters to respond.

    北京地质勘探学院在反右派斗争胜利后
    转入整改阶段再次大鸣大放
    本报讯　北京地质勘探学院的整风运动正在形成群众性的改进工作高潮。有关改进学校各方面工作的善意的批评和建议，像雨后春笋似地在大字报上提出来。到12日止，师生员工贴出了一千几百张包括三千八百多条意见的大字报。
      8月以来，这个学校在反右派斗争取得巨大胜利后，学校整风运动就进入了边整边改阶段。学校党委会成立了教学行政、工资福利等小组，分别研究群众大鸣大放期间提出的一百三十五个重大问题，并且对其中一百十五个问题进行了处理，向群众作了交代。新学年开始后，学校党委会分析了学校整风的情况后，认为党委边整边改方面的工作做得还很不够，有必要发动群众提意见，帮助党委改进工作。党委副书记肖英在最近进行的社会主义思想教育的动员报告中，向全校师生员工说明了右派分子的进攻同一般善意批评之间的区别，以及党委对于边整边改的决心，基本上消除了群众的顾虑。
    在这期间，这个学校党委对几件事情的处理，例如公布了对犯错误的党员的处分，根据学生们的意见，三天内成立了社会主义教育阅览室，并帮助毕业班学生学习国际时事。这些事情使师生员工获得了明确的印象，就是党委改进工作的决心是很大的。从10月4日到9日，他们就贴出了一千一百多张大字报。这些大字报生动地反映了全校师生员工，特别是青年学生在反右派斗争中觉悟的提高，充分表现了他们对学校工作的强烈的主人翁思想。
    几天来，这个学院三个饭厅前新盖的席棚上大字报贴得琳琅满目。要求改进教学工作是大家提意见的中心。普通地质教研室李志绛等四人、矿物教研室董镇等人，分别在大字报上建议加强教学实习的师资力量，希望学校很好地重视每年的教学实习总结，不断改进实习工作。矿物教研室赵其渊等四人建议在教学实习基地开辟小型陈列馆，以便教员备课。石油及天然气矿产地质系学生张林生等对今年的生产实习分配不恰当提出了意见。还有许多大字报对讲义和图书的供应、陈列室的利用等方面提出了建设性意见。
    也有的大字报揭发了校内浪费现象，并对如何勤俭办学校提出了意见。工厂管理科制配车间的人员在一张题为“永睡的机床”的大字报上批评了积压机床的现象。刘尚仁、朱积安在大字报上建议党委把义务劳动和学校内的生产、修整等工作联系起来进行。如组织学生修跑道、篮球场等等。
    现在，地质勘探学院党委会正紧张地根据群众意见进行处理。各系、处也都成立了边整边改工作组。在党委会提出的“党员带头、发动群众、层层负责、条条交代”的号召下，各单位对群众的意见也非常重视。许多大字报刚贴出不久，就有不少被批评的或有关主管单位贴出大字报予以答复。
