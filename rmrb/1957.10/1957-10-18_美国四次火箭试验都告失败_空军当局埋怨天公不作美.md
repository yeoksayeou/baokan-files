Xinhua News Agency, Washington, October 17th: American military authorities admitted on the 16th that they had recently conducted four rocket test launches, but all failed.

The launches took place on Eniwetok Island in the Pacific. According to Air Force authorities, the extremely low temperatures at high altitude "had an adverse effect on the balloons, preventing them from carrying the rockets to their intended positions, and thus the expected results were not obtained."

Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles spoke about the "balance of power" between the Soviet Union and the United States at a press conference on the 16th. Dulles admitted that the Soviet Union had greatly surpassed the United States in the manufacture of missiles and artificial satellites. He said that the Soviet Union's successful launch of a satellite may be a good thing, because Americans generally had some "complacency" before, thinking that the United States was almost automatically ahead of the Soviet Union in everything. However, the situation is not like this. He said he did not think there was complacency on the part of the U.S. government.

A reporter pointed out to Dulles that he was "confused" by Dulles' words and did not know whether the "good thing" he was talking about was because it taught the U.S. government something, or because it taught the American people something. Dulles had to admit that the Soviet Union's successful launch of an artificial satellite taught the U.S. government something. However, in order to reassure the public, Dulles insisted that, at present and for the next five to ten years, the decisive factor in assessing the balance of power from a military point of view seemed to be heavy bombers rather than missiles. He said that therefore, the United States still maintains its so-called "military superiority" over the Soviet Union. (Attached picture)

　　美国四次火箭试验都告失败
    空军当局埋怨天公不作美
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：美国军事当局16日承认，它最近进行了四次火箭试射工作，但是都失败了。
    发射是在太平洋的恩纳威托克岛进行的。据空军当局说，由于高空的温度极低，“对气球发生了不利的影响，没有把火箭带到应有的位置，因此没有得到预期的结果。”
    据新华社17日讯　美国国务卿杜勒斯16日在记者招待会上谈到苏联和美国的“力量对比”。杜勒斯承认苏联在制造导弹和人造卫星方面大大地赶过了美国。他说，苏联发射卫星成功，也许是件好事情，因为美国人以前普遍地有某种“自满情绪”，认为美国在一切方面几乎自动地走在苏联的前面。然而情况不是这样。他说他不认为美国政府方面有自满情绪。
    有记者向杜勒斯指出，他被杜勒斯的话“搞糊涂了”，不知道他所说的“好事情”究竟是因为它教会美国政府知道了某种东西，还是因为教会了美国人民知道某种东西。杜勒斯不得不承认苏联发射人造卫星成功教会美国政府知道了某种东西。但是，杜勒斯为了使公众安心，又硬说在目前以及在今后五年到十年内，从军事观点来估计力量的对比，起着决定性作用的似乎不是导弹而是重轰炸机。他说，因此，美国仍然保持着对苏联的所谓“军事优势”。（附图片）
