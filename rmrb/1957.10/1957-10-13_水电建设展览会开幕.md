Xinhua News Agency, 12th - During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the newly added hydropower generating equipment capacity in China will reach 520,000 kilowatts, which is equivalent to 43 times the total generating equipment capacity built during the Kuomintang rule. This is indicated on an eye-catching chart at the Hydropower Construction Exhibition being held in Beihai Park, Beijing.

The exhibition, organized by the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, opened to the public today.

The exhibition features many charts comparing the past and present, illustrating the rapid development of hydropower construction in the eight years since the founding of New China. From 1953 to the present, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry alone has invested in the construction of 19 large and medium-sized hydropower stations with a generating capacity of 2.7 million kilowatts. Before liberation, the largest hydro-turbine generator made in China was only 750 kilowatts. Now, a 72,500-kilowatt hydro-turbine generator, nearly 100 times larger, is about to be successfully trial-produced. Before liberation, it took the Kuomintang government five years to build a small hydropower station with a capacity of 3,000 kilowatts. Now, the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station with a capacity of 580,000 kilowatts is expected to be completed in just five years.

    水电建设展览会开幕
    据新华社12日讯　我国在第一个五年计划期间新增加的水力发电设备容量将达到五十二万瓩，相当于国民党统治时期所建全部发电设备容量的四十三倍。这是在首都北海公园展出的水力发电建设展览会上一幅引人注目的图表上表明的。
    这个展览会是由电力工业部举办的，今天开始公开展览。
    展览会上有许多今昔对比的图表，说明新中国成立八年来水电建设事业的发展是非常迅速的。从1953年到现在，仅电力工业部投资建设的就有十九个大中型水电站，发电能力可达二百七十万瓩。解放前我国自制的水轮发电机最大的只有七百五十瓩，现在比它大将近一百倍的七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机也快要试制成功。解放前国民党政府建设一个三千瓩的小水电站要五年，现在容量达五十八万瓩的新安江水电站预计只要五年就能建成。
