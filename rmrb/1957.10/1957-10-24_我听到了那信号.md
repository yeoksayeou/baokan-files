Ten Month Ode

    I heard that signal…
    Fang Ji I heard that signal
    It is a kind of summons
    Like the chirping of birds at dawn
    From outer space
    Orbiting the Earth
    It is flying… flying, and chirping
    Sending a signal to all humanity—
    History is heading towards a new journey
    Science has conquered the universe
    Breaking away from the destined geocentric gravity
    Humanity will fly into outer space
    Oh, that distant and desolate lunar palace
    The cassia tree in front of the palace
    The jade rabbit grinding medicine
    Chang'e's lonely spinning wheel…
    However, this is not a myth
    It is science—it is also reality
    An artificial satellite is orbiting the Earth
    The first artificial satellite took off
    From the world's first socialist country
    Along the red star of the Kremlin
    Announcing to mankind a new journey in history
    "Born here, buried here"...
    Oh, Earth, my mother
    Now, I am going to leave you
    To seek happiness in the sky—
    Towards infinite space
    Towards the moon, towards Mars
    Towards the entire solar system…
    Towards the industrious labor of mankind
    When labor is armed with science
    When science is armed with socialism
    When socialism is victorious, advancing
    On the road to communism
    The first artificial satellite took off
    Sending a call to mankind
    Like the chirping of birds at dawn
    Summoning people to a new journey
