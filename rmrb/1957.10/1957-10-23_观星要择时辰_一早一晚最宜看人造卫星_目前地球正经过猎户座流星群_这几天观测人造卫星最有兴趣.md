Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 22nd: Under what circumstances can artificial satellites and carrier rockets be seen? Lojinski, a scientific staff member of the Astronomical Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, recently answered this question in an interview with the press.

He said that satellites, like the surfaces of the Earth and other celestial bodies in the solar system, must be illuminated by sunlight. During the day, the sky is very bright, making it impossible to see satellites. In the early morning and evening, the brightness of the sky has greatly diminished, and artificial satellites can be seen with binoculars and small opera glasses. When the sun falls below the horizon and only the highest layers of the atmosphere, higher than the satellite's orbit, are illuminated by sunlight, the satellite falls into the Earth's shadow and becomes invisible. Therefore, optical stations can only conduct observations in the evening and morning.

Regarding reports from various places of satellites being seen with the naked eye, Lojinski pointed out that most of what was seen was the carrier rocket. He said that the carrier rocket is essentially also a celestial body orbiting the Earth. Because it has a larger, reflective surface than the satellite, the carrier rocket is easier to see.

The satellite's outer shell is made of aluminum alloy, which reflects light well, so it is also possible to see the satellite with the naked eye, but this must be when the local sky is quite dark as it passes over the observation point.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 22nd: Professor Fesensky, head of the Meteor Group of the Soviet International Geophysical Year Committee, recently told the press that by studying collisions between artificial satellites and meteors, it is possible to estimate the approximate distance of large, destructive meteoroids in space and more accurately predict the flight of artificial satellites and carrier rockets in space. From the 20th to the 23rd, the Earth is passing through the Orionid meteor shower, making observations of artificial satellites particularly interesting these days.

Professor Fesensky pointed out that in addition to the Earth and other planets, there are a large number of small iron and stone meteors orbiting the sun. They are widely distributed around the sun, and the Earth travels among them. Every day and night, the Earth encounters millions of these tiny meteors. When the Earth encounters a so-called meteor shower, dozens of meteors can be seen per hour, and radar can record two thousand meteors per hour. Countless dust-sized particles, so-called micrometeoroids, are like constant raindrops beating the upper layers of the atmosphere. The Orionid meteor shower that the Earth is passing through this time is a meteor stream formed by the partial disintegration of Halley's Comet.

Professor Fesensky pointed out that future interstellar spacecraft must pass through the densest meteor layers. Studying the collisions between artificial satellites and meteors is of great significance for future spaceflight. Artificial satellites, as scouts exploring the way for future interstellar spacecraft, are now undergoing attacks from micrometeoroids, which will leave marks on the satellites and carrier rockets. However, as of October 11th, no meteoroids have been found to have significantly damaged them. It is expected that special instruments will be used in the future to record such impacts.

Fesensky said that because artificial satellites are orbiting in the rarefied upper atmosphere and are still subject to resistance, the satellites will fall towards the Earth's surface along a spiral orbit. The light emitted by artificial satellites during their fall is similar to that of meteors, but more sustained. Scientists can obtain data on the air density in the upper atmosphere when studying meteors. Therefore, observing the light emitted by satellites during their final fall is of great scientific value.

    观星要择时辰
    一早一晚最宜看人造卫星
    目前地球正经过猎户座流星群
    这几天观测人造卫星最有兴趣
    新华社莫斯科22日电　在什么情况下可以看见人造卫星和运载火箭，苏联科学院天文委员会科学工作人员洛京斯基最近在对报界发表的一次谈话中答复了这个问题。
    他说，卫星像地球和太阳系其他天体的表面一样，要靠太阳光来照亮。白天天空很亮，不可能看到卫星。在清晨和傍晚时刻，天空的亮度已经大大减弱，用双筒望远镜和不大的观剧望远镜就可以看到人造卫星。当太阳落到地平线下而只有比卫星轨道还要高的大气最高层才能被阳光照到的时候，卫星落到了地球的黑影中，因而也就无法看到了。因此光学站只能在傍晚和清晨进行观测。
    在谈到各地传来肉眼看到卫星的消息时，洛京斯基指出，大多数看到的是运载火箭。他说，这个运载火箭实质上现在也是一个环绕地球运行的天体。由于它具有比卫星大的、能反光的表面，运载火箭比较容易看见。
    卫星的外壳由铝合金制成，可以很好地反射光线，因此用肉眼也有可能看到卫星，但是必须是在它经过观测地点时当地天空相当昏黑的时候。
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联国际地球物理年委员会流星组组长费登斯基教授最近向报界发表谈话说，根据人造卫星同流星相碰情况可以推算出空中有破坏力的巨大流星体的大致距离，更精确地预见人造卫星和运载火箭在宇宙间飞行的情况。20日至23日地球经过猎户座流星群，这几天对人造卫星的观测是特别有兴趣的。
    费登斯基教授指出，除地球和其他行星之外，环绕太阳运行的还有大量铁质和石质的细小流星。它们广布在太阳周围，地球就在其间运行。每一昼夜，地球要遇上千百万颗这种微小的流星。当地球遇见所谓流星群时，一小时可看到数十个流星，用雷达一小时可以记录两千个流星。像尘埃大小的所谓微粒流星更是多得不可胜数，它们像不停的雨点拍打着大气的上层。这次地球经过的猎户座流星群是由于哈雷彗星局部崩裂而形成的一个流星群。
    费登斯基教授指出，未来星际飞艇必须穿过最密的流星层。研究人造卫星同流星相碰的情况，对未来的宇宙飞行有很大意义。作为未来星际飞艇探路的侦察兵的人造卫星，现在正经受着微粒流星的袭击，这些袭击会给卫星和运载火箭留下伤痕。但是截至10月11日止，还没有发现有流星体明显地碰伤它们。预计将来可用特制的仪器把这种撞击记录下来。
    费登斯基说，由于人造卫星运行在稀薄的大气上层中仍受到阻力，卫星将沿着螺旋形轨道向地球的表面陨落。人造卫星在陨落时发出的光和陨星相似，但比陨星更为持久。科学家在研究陨星的时候可以获得关于大气上层空气密度的资料，因此，观察卫星在最后陨落时发出的光在科学上有很大价值。
