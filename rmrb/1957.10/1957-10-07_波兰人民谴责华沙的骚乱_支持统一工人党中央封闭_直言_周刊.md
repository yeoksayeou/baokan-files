Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 6th. According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, workers and social organizations in the Polish capital and across the country are continuing to voice their condemnation of the perpetrators of the Warsaw riot incident.

Workers from many industrial and mining enterprises, such as the Gdansk Shipyard and the Bierut Steelworks in Czestochowa, passed resolutions at mass meetings, expressing their full support for the decision of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee leadership to close the "Po Prostu" weekly, and condemning the Warsaw riots.

The Secretariat of the Warsaw Committee of the Polish Socialist Youth Union passed a special resolution, firmly condemning the instigators of the riots. The Secretariat decided to expel Wilas and Gronostaj, the main organizers of the Warsaw mass rally, from the leadership of the Warsaw League organization and the Socialist Youth Union.

The plenary meeting of the Central Council of the Polish Student Union, which began in Gdansk on October 5, as well as some engineering and technical personnel organizations, also expressed condemnation of the Warsaw riots.

The editorial published by "People's Tribune" on the 5th stated that the decision to close the "Po Prostu" weekly triggered an attempt by the most immature, politically disoriented, and openly reactionary student groups in some Warsaw universities to provoke atrocities, an action that was not without the active participation of thugs. The broad masses of Warsaw youth did not participate in this reactionary atrocity. Those who disrupt the peace and order of the country must be held responsible for their actions.

"Warsaw Life" also published an editorial condemning the riots, saying that such behavior is a crime that must be punished in terms of its consequences. Only bad elements and those hostile to the Polish state hope to engage in various demonstrations and quarrels.

    波兰人民谴责华沙的骚乱
    支持统一工人党中央封闭“直言”周刊
    新华社华沙6日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰首都和全国各地的职工以及社会团体，继续不断地发出了对华沙骚乱事件的肇事者的谴责。
    革但斯克造船厂、捷斯托科发的贝鲁特冶金企业等许多工矿企业的职工，都在群众大会上通过了决议，表示完全支持波兰统一工人党中央领导关于封闭“直言”周刊的决定，并且谴责华沙的骚乱。
    波兰社会主义青年联盟华沙委员会书记处通过了一项专门的决议，坚决谴责骚乱的肇事者。书记处决定把华沙这次群众集会的主要组织者——维拉斯和格罗诺斯塔伊——开除出华沙盟组织的领导机构和社会主义青年联盟。
    10月5日开始在革但斯克举行的波兰学生联盟中央理事会全体会议，以及一些工程技术人员的组织等，也都对华沙的骚乱表示了谴责。
    “人民论坛报”5日发表的社论谈到，封闭“直言”周刊的决定引起了华沙某些高等学校中最不成熟、政治上迷失方向以及公开反动的学生集团企图挑起暴行，这种行动并不是没有暴徒积极参加的。华沙的广大青年并没有参加这种反动暴行。那些扰乱国家的和平秩序的人们必须对他们的行为负责。
    “华沙生活报”也发表社论谴责这次骚乱说，这种行径从后果来说是一种必须受到惩罚的罪行。只有坏分子和敌视波兰国家的人们才希望搞各种示威和争吵。
