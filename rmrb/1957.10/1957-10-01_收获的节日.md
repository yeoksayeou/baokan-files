    Harvest Festival
    Ruan Yan Shun
    In 1957, we experienced an extraordinary spring, a fighting summer, and are now celebrating a passionate autumn.
    In the spring storms, we underwent an extraordinary test. When sinister winds rose, demonic mists filled the air, and demons and monsters danced wildly, the towering socialist palace stood firm, and the Party shone like the sun and moon. Fragrant flowers or poisonous weeds, good or evil, beautiful or ugly, true or false, right or wrong, all became clearly apparent.
    In the summer battles, we underwent rigorous training. After fighting, sinister winds stopped, demonic mists dissipated, demons and monsters were subdued, poisonous weeds were uprooted, evil was eradicated, and truth triumphed over falsehood, beauty over ugliness.
    Thus, a world of clear skies and bright sunshine, fragrant flowers blooming everywhere, and righteous spirit soaring emerged. Socialism became more consolidated, the people became stronger, and the Party became greater.
    Thus, those who planted melons got melons, and those who planted beans got beans; those who spread sparks burned themselves, and those who cultivated poisonous seedlings ate bitter fruit.
    Autumn is the season of harvest. In the field of political thought, we have achieved a particularly bountiful harvest, and the intellectuals have gained especially much. We also happily participated in physical labor, helping the farmers with the autumn harvest, received better training, made more and better friends, and gained even more.
    Our autumn is a season of fruitful yields, and also a season of blooming flowers. In government agencies, factories and mines, in rural areas, in streets, in all walks of life, and among the people of the whole country, a passionate great blooming and contending is unfolding. Someone said: "The big-character posters in the factory are like a garden full of blooming flowers." How wonderful. Socialist democracy, the nationwide great debate, is unprecedented and radiates with boundless brilliance. The people's servants, the commanders of socialist construction, under the supervision and help of the people, are resolutely and thoroughly changing their style and improving their work.
    Autumn is a season of harvest, and also a season of great sowing. The fruits we harvest are all newly sown seeds. The flowers of socialist education have just begun to bloom, and the flowers of the nationwide great debate have just begun to bloom. Look forward to an even more abundant harvest next year.
    In this golden autumn, our Eighth National Day is coming. We will celebrate with enthusiastic harvesting and enthusiastic sowing.

    收获的节日
    阮延顺
    1957年，我们经历了一个不平凡的春天，一个战斗的夏天，正度着热烈的秋天。
    在春天的风浪里，我们经受了不平凡的考验。在阴风四起，妖雾迷天，牛鬼蛇魔乱舞的当儿，巍峨的社会主义宫殿屹立不动，党昭然如日月。香花或毒草，善或恶，美或丑，真或伪，正或邪，便都分明显现。
    在夏季的战斗里，我们经受了严格的锻炼。经过搏斗：阴风止，妖雾消，牛鬼蛇魔被降伏，毒草被锄掉，邪恶被翦除，真战胜伪，美战胜丑。
    于是，显出了日朗风清，香花遍野、正气升腾的世界。社会主义更巩固，人民更坚强，党更伟大。
    于是，种瓜的得了瓜，种豆的得了豆；散布火种的烧了自己，培植毒苗的食了恶果。
    秋天是收获的季节。在政治思想的田野上，我们获得了特别的丰收，知识界的人们所得特多。我们又欢欢喜喜去参加了体力劳动，帮助农民们秋收，受到更好的锻炼，交了更多更好的朋友，所得的就更多。
    我们的秋天，是果实累累的季节，也是百花盛开的季节。在机关、在厂矿、在农村、在街道、在各行各业、在全国人民中，展开着热烈的大鸣大放。有人说：“工厂里的大字报好像百花盛开的园圃”。真好。社会主义的民主，全民的大辩论，亘古未有，光芒万丈。人民的勤务员，社会主义建设的指挥者，在人民的监督下、帮助下，狠狠地，狠狠地改变作风，改进工作。
    秋天是丰收的季节，又是大播种的季节。我们收得的果实，又都是新播下的种籽。社会主义教育的花刚开放，全民大辩论的花刚开放。看明年将会有更丰满的收成。
    就在这金色的秋天，我们的第八届国庆节来到了。我们用热烈的收割，热烈的播种，进行热烈的庆祝。
