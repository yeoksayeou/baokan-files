Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: Soviet experts have cultivated a large number of successors in Beijing's industrial colleges for teaching and researching new majors and specializations.

According to incomplete statistics, in recent years, over thirty Soviet experts at Tsinghua University alone have directly trained 230 graduate students and 479 in-service teachers. These in-service teachers and graduate students improved rapidly under the kind guidance of the Soviet experts. Many of the teachers who studied building construction with Soviet expert Sadovich are now heads of teaching and research groups and have become the backbone for offering this course in industrial colleges throughout the country. Pan Jiluan, a graduate student in welding, wrote a thesis that Soviet experts considered to be at the level of a Soviet associate doctorate.

The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology was the first iron and steel industry college in New China, established based on the Soviet Metallurgical Institute. At the time of its establishment, there was a severe shortage of teachers. Through years of training by Soviet experts, a large number of young teachers with considerable scientific knowledge have emerged in the college. Guan Yurong, who was trained by Soviet experts, received good feedback from both students and senior professors after starting to teach electrometallurgy.

At the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, the current teachers who teach new majors such as mining engineering, hydrogeology, and geophysical exploration have all grown up in the past two or three years under the training of Soviet experts.

The in-service teachers at the Beijing Railway Institute who studied automatic control, basic theory of remote control, refrigerated transport, and station hubs with Soviet experts can now independently teach these courses.

Before leaving the colleges, Soviet experts helped each school establish laboratories for newly opened majors and left behind textbooks and lecture notes they had written for Chinese students. After leaving, they continued to write letters to students, send materials, care about their every achievement, and help them solve problems.

    在北京工业院校的苏联专家
    培养了大批专业接班人
    据新华社27日讯　苏联专家替北京各工业院校培养了大批讲授和研究新专业、专门化的接班人。
    据不完全统计，几年来仅清华大学的三十多位苏联专家就直接培养了二百三十名研究生和四百七十九名进修教师。这些进修教师和研究生在苏联专家亲切的教导下提高得很快。曾经跟苏联专家萨多维奇学建筑施工的教师，现在许多人都当了教研组的主任，成为各地工业院校开设这一课程的骨干。焊结专业研究生潘纪銮写出来的论文，苏联专家认为已达到苏联副博士的水平。
    北京钢铁学院是以苏联冶金学院为榜样建立起来的新中国第一所钢铁工业学院，建院时师资非常缺乏。经苏联专家连年来的培养，学院里现在已涌现大批具有相当科学水平的青年教师。经苏联专家培养的关毓珑，在开讲电冶金课程后，不仅学生反映很好，还得到老教授的好评。
    在北京地质勘探学院，当前讲授探矿工程、水文地质和地球物理探矿等新专业的教师，都是最近两三年在苏联专家培养下成长起来的。
    北京铁道学院随苏联专家学习自动控制、远程控制理论基础、冷藏运输、车站枢纽等课程的进修教师，现在都能独立开课了。
    苏联专家在离校前，都帮助各校建立了新开专业的实验室，留下他们为中国学生编写的教材和讲义；离校后还不断给学生来信，寄赠资料，关心他们的每一成就，帮他们解答问题。
