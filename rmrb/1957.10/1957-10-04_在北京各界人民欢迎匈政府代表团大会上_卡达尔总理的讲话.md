Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear comrades and friends of Beijing:

We are extremely pleased to be in China at the invitation of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, to be with the great Chinese people who are victoriously carrying out the socialist revolution, and to be able to meet here today with the people participating in the capital's labor congress.

On behalf of all members of the Hungarian government delegation, I express my sincere gratitude for this friendly reception and pay my heartfelt respect to you.

We have felt in various forms the care and sympathy of the Chinese people for the Hungarian people. Please allow me to talk about the struggle of the Hungarian people.

**The Hungarian People Rapidly Developed Socialist Construction After Liberation**

In the past twelve years, the enemies of the Hungarian people have continuously attacked our People's Republic. They criticized the various shortcomings of the people's democratic system, including exploiting the stale clichés of social welfare and pointing out the backwardness of the people's living standards.

The relatively backward phenomena that did exist in some aspects were precisely the legacy left to the Hungarian people and the people's democratic state by the evils of the imperialists and the Hungarian big capitalists and landlords. The imperialists and their Hungarian servants who attacked us remained silent on this point. Today, the reason why the Hungarian working people can live like human beings, why they can have today and a socialist future, is precisely because these capitalists and landlords have been driven out of power, their own people's state has been established, and they have begun to eliminate the backwardness caused by their evils. The imperialists also avoid talking about this point.

In a very short period of time in history, in the period after 1945, the Hungarian working class, in alliance with the peasants and under the leadership of the Communist Party, had already established a people's democratic state. In the previous thirty years, during World War I, the counter-revolution of 1919, and World War II, the equivalent of 11% of today's Hungarian population, more than 1.1 million Hungarians, lost their lives. In 1945, the Hitler army, fleeing under the blows of the victorious Soviet army, destroyed all the bridges in our country, destroyed the railway network, and destroyed hundreds of factories and tens of thousands of houses. The people suffered from material shortages and cultural backwardness. People called capitalist and landlord Hungary the country of three million beggars. In 1945, the people took over a backward, ruined, paralyzed, and plundered country. The Hungarian people built a developing country engaged in socialist construction in a relatively short period of time, after years of selfless labor on the ruins and in the face of difficult prospects. In 1956, the industry of the Hungarian People's Republic was three and a half times that of 1938. On approximately ten million hectares of land, 313 agricultural machine and tractor stations, 24,000 tractors, and 6,200 combine harvesters were helping the peasants to work. The number of middle school students increased from 52,000 to 175,000, the number of university students increased from 12,000 to 40,000, and the number of books published annually increased from 9 million to 22 million. The development situation in all aspects is similar to this. This development was only possible when the people's government distributed the land of the big landlords to 600,000 peasants, nationalized the factories, and established large-scale state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives on 30% of the country's arable land.

These achievements were achieved in the constant struggle against the domestic fascist and capitalist reactionary forces allied with imperialism. Thanks to these struggles and twelve years of labor, the Hungarian working people have transformed from slaves of capitalists and landlords into free people and masters of their own country.

**For the People, a Perfect Capitalist System is a Thousand Times Worse Than a People's Democratic System**

The imperialists talked a lot about the past mistakes of our party and the people's democratic government, and these mistakes did exist. A small number of dogmatists who grasped the leadership of the party and the government were overwhelmed by victory and began a bureaucratic and sectarian leadership that was divorced from the masses in 1948. Many serious losses arose from this. The most serious loss was the weakening of the connection between the party leadership and the party members, and between the party and the masses. This, in fact, weakened the worker-peasant regime and provided the enemy with the possibility of attacking the system.

We have been and are irreconcilable critics of these old mistakes. We will firmly remember these mistakes in order to prevent them from happening again. But if the enemies of our people want to attack our system because we have made these mistakes, then we want to tell them that what determines the characteristics of this system and the past twelve years is not the mistakes, but the great creation of labor in building socialism.

If we use a metaphor to illustrate, then we can tell them that for the people, the shackles of a perfect and brilliant capitalist system are a million times worse than the sword of a people's democratic system. Even if someone stains this sword, the situation is the same. Let the people wipe off the stains on the sword themselves, they will make the sword shine again and make the imperialists feel dazzling.

**There Should Be No Compromise With Counter-Revolution, But Struggle Should Be Insisted Upon**

All domestic and foreign forces hostile to the people, taking advantage of the loosening of ties between the party and the masses and relying on the planning and money of US imperialism, launched a general offensive against the Hungarian People's Republic and launched the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots. The Hungarian people's regime and peace were in extremely dangerous situations.

In the case of the Nagy Imre group's internal and external collusion and betrayal, the October counter-revolutionary offensive achieved temporary and local success, and some bourgeois counter-revolutionary reactionary forces and fascist mercenaries also sneaked into the regime. White terror began in several districts of Budapest and throughout the country, massacring communists and progressives.

The counter-revolutionary events caused serious losses to the Hungarian people and temporarily frustrated their socialist construction. Although the counter-revolution caused losses, it also provided experiences that are already beneficial to the current development and can be used in the future.

Our most important experience may be that traitors who have run to the enemy's camp should not be persuaded, but should be eliminated as enemies. There should be no compromise with counter-revolution, but struggle should be insisted upon. Dealing with man-eating tigers cannot be tamed with pieces of meat, but only with the method of aiming the muzzle. With such lessons, the Hungarian people who were loyal to socialism united in serious moments and struggled against betrayal and counter-revolution. The broad masses of the people were mobilized to fight to defend the people's regime, to defend the achievements of twelve years of struggle, and to defend the socialist future.

Hungarian workers, miners, cooperative farmers, individual farmers, and progressive intellectuals who were loyal to socialism and loyal to the most fundamental principle of socialism—proletarian internationalism—stood up and, with the help of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal socialist countries, defended the cause of socialism and peace in Hungary outstandingly. The constitutional order and normal life of the Hungarian People's Republic were restored, revolutionary armed forces were organized, state organs worked as usual, the army stuck to its posts, and new, people's armed forces—workers' self-defense forces—were also established. The power departments held accountable those criminals who had engaged in anti-people activities, those who had engaged in murder, robbery, and arson.

Our production work has been successful. In August this year, industrial output had reached 101% of the average monthly output of last year, and labor productivity had reached 97%. The peasants carefully cultivated the land, and this year's grain harvest was even better than last year. Of the 1,700 agricultural production cooperatives that were destroyed by the counter-revolution, 1,400 have been reorganized.

It cannot be said that all our problems have been solved. But history has also tempered our party, our country, and our people, so our people are full of confidence in the future.

**The Nagy Group Exaggerated the Party's Mistakes, Opposed the Party's Leadership, and Finally Carried Out Shameful Betrayal**

The party and the government have the trust and support of the basic working masses. In May, the Hungarian National Assembly unanimously approved all the measures of the worker-peasant revolutionary government, including the issue of Soviet government's military assistance, and passed the government's program on future political, economic, and cultural tasks.

We also include the experience of the Nagy Imre group as an important lesson. The anti-rightist struggles in the international workers' movement have similar experiences, the conflicting class forces are the same, and their tactics and methods are also the same. The Nagy Imre group began to attack the party in 1953 and gained leadership in the party. They exaggerated the mistakes of the party leadership, initially slandered and then completely doubted the achievements of the people's democratic regime. The like of Nagy Imre did not oppose mistakes, but opposed the party and the party's leading role, opposed the party's unity, and finally opposed the entire dictatorship of the proletariat.

Their anti-party revisionist ideas and the imperialists' tactics are exactly the same. This ideological offensive almost extended to all aspects of the people's regime. One of the basic characteristics is: initially starting discussions, and later denying the leading role of the working class and hindering the specific realization of the leading role of the working class, and declaring that leadership should be handed over to intellectuals. They negated the necessity of implementing socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, negated the general laws of socialist construction that are effective for all people's democratic countries, and developed into bourgeois nationalism under the pretext of respecting national characteristics. This group thus logically developed into traitors to the people's regime and counter-revolutionaries.

This situation clearly illustrates the correctness of the thesis made by Comrade Mao Zedong in the Chinese Communist Party that contradictions among the people can, under certain circumstances, be transformed into antagonistic contradictions between ourselves and the enemy.

Nagy Imre's revisionist arguments a few years ago, which could still be regarded as contradictions among the people at the time, later developed into denying the party's leading role and anti-Soviet bourgeois nationalism. Their use of sectarian methods inevitably led them to run to the side of the imperialist-capitalist enemy.

It is not the first time that traitors have betrayed the cause of the workers' movement, but such a hateful betrayal as that of the like of Nagy Imre is rare in the workers' movement. The betrayal of his followers and defenders was carried out under the banner of so-called "national communism." However, experience is like this: class enemies can cause great harm with the help of such traitors, but they cannot change the historical path of socialism.

The struggle will certainly continue. Part of the counter-revolutionary forces have been eliminated, part have fled abroad, and part have dispersed and gone underground. Traitors have been cleared from the party and important state organs, but the imperialists still exist, and their failure in Hungary has caused them great anger. They will not let go of any opportunity to attack the Hungarian People's Republic.

The five-nation committee formed in the name of the United Nations and the quarrel surrounding the five-nation committee are like this. The United Nations convened a special meeting for a week to discuss the so-called Hungarian issue concocted by the imperialists, without discussing events that actually exist and need to be resolved that have world political significance, such as the issue of China's representation in the United Nations. They believe that this issue can be resolved with just one hour of discussion and voting. This situation is regrettable and will not enhance the prestige of the United Nations.

The accusations of the imperialists are temporary and self-intoxicated. The day will surely come when the unfounded accusations against the Hungarian People's Republic will no longer be on the agenda of the United Nations, just as the People's Republic of China cannot be excluded from the United Nations for long.

**Maintaining the Leadership of the Working Class and Its Party is the Vital Interest of the Entire People**

We Hungarians are implementing the policies of our party and government, and life has proven that the general line of this policy is correct.

We must defend and strengthen the party's leading role, because the counter-revolutionary offensive in Hungary has once again proved that if the leading role of the working class's revolutionary Marxist-Leninist party is weakened, the working class's regime will be in danger.

We must defend and strengthen the party's unity, party discipline, democracy within the party, and frequent, close, and lively ties with the masses.

Our example proves that in countries building socialism, it is in the interests of the entire people, the entire society, and every citizen for the party to stand in its position and bear the leading role given to it by history.

We know that defending the party is defending the people's peace, the development of socialism, national sovereignty, and national independence. It is the vital interest not only of communists but of the entire people and the entire country for the working class and the working class's revolutionary party to fully assume and maintain their leading position. Of course, the party can only play this role by relying on the masses and winning the trust and support of the masses. This is one of the important lessons of the October events.

We must resolutely strengthen the people's democratic state, which plays the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat, in two aspects. On the one hand, it is the punishment and restriction of the enemy by the people and the people's regime, and on the other hand, it is the development and defense of the democratic rights of the masses and the struggle for the constant support of the masses.

We must strengthen the strength of the state and state organs, while preventing the growth of bureaucracy in state organs.

We must improve the state's economic leadership and organizational work, so that in the event of material losses caused by the counter-revolution, we can still maintain the people's living standards. We must develop production so that we can improve the people's living standards on this basis in the future according to actual possibilities.

**Proletarian Internationalism is the Strongest Factor in the Friendship Between the Peoples of Socialist Countries**

Dear Comrades:

The counter-revolution manufactured by imperialism in Hungary concentrated its main firepower on attacking proletarian internationalism, the alliance with the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact, and the unity of the peoples of countries building socialism. Therefore, we believe that strengthening the internationalist spirit of the Hungarian working people is the main task of defending the interests of the Hungarian People's Republic.

The imperialists oppose the realization of the famous Five Principles first announced in the Sino-Indian Agreement. We respect the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We believe that these principles can be realized in the relations between two countries with different internal systems, and will be realized on an increasingly wider scale.

At the same time, we believe that the principles of proletarian internationalism have also been further developed. In the past, everyone understood proletarian internationalism as the international unity between the revolutionary parties of the working class and between the working masses across national borders.

In our era, when socialism has become a world system, when the people of many countries are building socialism in their own countries, the principles of proletarian internationalism have become the most profound essential issue in the relations between socialist countries and the peoples of countries building socialism.

Within the socialist camp, proletarian internationalism means the fraternal alliance of the peoples of all countries, deep and indivisible friendship, and further means a common destiny. This is deeper than the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

In order to oppose certain views, there is such a view in our country that the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and the other four principles should also be realized in the relations between socialist countries, but this is not enough here. We have common joys and common worries. We feel that the worries and pains of the Hungarian people when they are tested are also the common worries and pains of the peoples of all countries in the socialist camp. Therefore, we must strive to implement the spirit of proletarian internationalism into the hearts of the Hungarian people. Proletarian internationalism is the strongest internal factor in the friendship between the peoples of all countries building socialism.

The existence of a socialist camp united in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, with peace-loving socialist powers such as the Soviet Union and China at the forefront of the socialist camp, is beneficial to the entire mankind. This united force is the most powerful defender of world peace and the international pillar of the cause of social progress.

Dear Listeners:

The idea of proletarian internationalism unites our two peoples, China and Hungary, which are far apart. It is this idea that brought us here to participate in this conference.

I can say that the Hungarian people cherish the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the years after the establishment of the People's Republic with lofty respect and love.

We know that in the past China was a backward semi-colonial country, with 90% of the industry in the hands of foreign imperialism and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie colluding with it, and 80% of the land in the hands of a small number of big landlords.

Today, the vast majority of industry is the people's and socialist property, and 95% of the cultivated land is being cultivated by farmers participating in production cooperatives.

Some people in our delegation have been to China more than once. I personally am here for the second time, and I have personally seen this rapid development. A few days ago, we saw new factories equipped with the most advanced technology that are working well, and any country and people in the world would be proud to have such factories.

We visited agricultural production cooperatives, attended meetings held in universities in Beijing, and saw the unforgettable "October 1st" holiday parade from beginning to end. Everywhere we see that people are enthusiastic, disciplined, their lives are meaningful, they believe in their own strength and are integrated with their leaders.

The People's Republic of China exists, it is strong, and it is developing healthily. It is one of the most prestigious factors in international life. No major issue in the world today can be decided without it. This is one of the huge realistic factors that US imperialism is unwilling to admit. Nevertheless, the People's Republic of China exists, and the number of countries willing to cooperate with it is constantly increasing, which is a matter of rejoicing for mankind.

We Hungarians have confidence in our just cause, and we are full of confidence in the further strengthening of our People's Republic, which has gone through great storms, and its socialist future.

We are also full of confidence in further strengthening the unity of all countries building socialism, and in our great friends, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

We believe that the forces of social progress, socialism, and peace are invincible.

Dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear comrades of Beijing:

After we return to our country, we will faithfully introduce everything we have seen in China. We will tell our people the brotherly love for the Hungarian People's Republic that we have felt in China.

I ask you to convey the gratitude of the Hungarian working people to all the working people of Beijing for the fraternal assistance they gave to the Hungarian people in our difficult times.

I wish the great Chinese people victory and happiness!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the working people of Beijing!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples!

Long live the unity of the socialist camp and its leading force, the Soviet Union!

Long live peace!

### 在北京各界人民欢迎匈政府代表团大会上  卡达尔总理的讲话

专栏：

    在北京各界人民欢迎匈政府代表团大会上
    卡达尔总理的讲话亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的北京的同志们，朋友们：
    我们应中华人民共和国国务院的邀请来到中国，能够同正在胜利地进行社会主义革命的伟大的中国人民在一起，并且今天能够在这里同参加首都劳动人民大会的人们见面，感到无限高兴。
    我代表匈牙利政府代表团全体团员对这种友好的接待表示十分感谢，并且向你们致衷心的敬意。
    我们从各种不同的形式，体会到中国人民对匈牙利人民的关怀和同情。请允许我谈一谈匈牙利人民的斗争情况。
    解放后的匈牙利人民迅速发展了各项社会主义建设
    在过去的十二年中间，匈牙利人民的敌人不断地进攻我们的人民共和国，他们指责人民民主制度的各种缺点，其中包括利用社会福利的陈腐滥调，指责人民生活水平的落后现象。
    我们在某些方面确实存在的较为落后的现象，正是由于帝国主义者和匈牙利大资本家、地主的罪恶才遗留给匈牙利人民和人民民主国家的，向我们进攻的帝国主义者和他们的匈牙利仆从们对于这一点却默不作声。今天匈牙利劳动人民所以能够过人的日子，所以能有今天和社会主义未来，正是因为已经把这些资本家和地主从政权中赶走，建立了自己的人民国家，并且已经开始消灭由于他们的罪恶而产生的落后现象，帝国主义者对于这一点也避而不谈。
    在历史上是很短的一段时期里，在1945年以后的阶段里，同农民结成联盟的匈牙利工人阶级，在共产党领导之下，已经建立起一个人民民主国家。在这以前的三十年中，在第一次世界大战，1919年的反革命和第二次世界大战期间，相当于今天匈牙利人口的11％，即一百一十多万匈牙利人丧失了生命。1945年在胜利的苏军的打击下逃走的希特勒军队破坏了我国所有的桥梁，摧毁了铁路网，破坏了几百个工厂和几万幢住宅。人民遭受着物质匮乏和文化落后的折磨。人们把资本家、地主的匈牙利称之为三百万乞丐的国家。1945年人民把一个落后的、废墟遍地的、瘫痪了的和遭受劫夺的国家接收过来。匈牙利人民在废墟上和前景困难的处境里，在较短的时间内，经过几年忘我的劳动建成了一个向前发展的、正在进行社会主义建设的国家。1956年匈牙利人民共和国的工业相当于1938年的三倍半。在大约一千万霍尔特的土地上，有三百一十三个农业机器拖拉机站，二万四千架拖拉机，六千二百架收割机在帮助农民工作。中学生数目从五万二千人增加到十七万五千人，大学生数目从一万二千人增加到四万人，每年出版的书籍从九百万册增加到二千二百万册。所有各方面的发展情况都是与此相似的。这种发展只有在人民政权把大地主的土地分配给六十万农民，把工厂收归人民所有，并且全国30％可耕地上建立起大规模经营的国营农场和农业生产合作社的情况下才有可能。
    这些成就是在同那些与帝国主义结成联盟的国内法西斯主义和资本主义的反动势力进行不断的斗争中取得的。由于这些斗争和十二年来的劳动，匈牙利劳动人民已经从资本家和地主的奴隶变成了自由人和自己国家的主人。
    对于人民，一个完满无缺的资本主义制度，要比人民民主制度坏千万倍
    帝国主义者讲了很多关于我们党和人民民主政权过去的错误，这些错误是确实存在的。掌握了党的领导和政府的一小部分教条主义者，他们被胜利冲昏了头脑，1948年开始了脱离群众的、官僚主义的和宗派主义的领导。很多严重的损失都是从这里产生的。最严重的损失是党的领导和党员之间以及党和群众之间的联系松弛了。这在事实上削弱了工农政权，并且为敌人提供了向这个制度进攻的可能性。
    我们过去和现在都是这些旧错误的不调和的批评者。我们将牢牢地记住这些错误，为的是不让它们重新发生。但是如果我们人民的敌人因为我们犯了这些错误而要向我们的制度进攻，那末我们要告诉他们，决定这个制度和过去十二年的特点的，并不是错误，而是建设社会主义的劳动的伟大创造。
    假如我们用一个譬喻来说明，那么我们可以告诉他们，对人民来说，一个完满无缺的、光辉的资本主义制度的枷锁，要比人民民主制度的宝剑坏得不知千百万倍。即使有人在这把宝剑上染上污点，情况也是这样。让人民自己来擦掉宝剑上的污点，他们会让宝剑重新发出光辉，并且使帝国主义者感到刺眼。
    对待反革命不应该妥协，而是应该坚持斗争
    所有国内外敌视人民的势力，利用党和群众联系的松弛，依靠美帝国主义的策划和金钱，向匈牙利人民共和国展开了总的攻势，发动了匈牙利反革命暴动。匈牙利人民政权和和平陷入了极端危险的境地。
    在纳吉·伊姆雷集团里应外合的叛变的情况下，十月反革命的进攻得到了暂时的和局部的成功，一部分资产阶级反革命的反动力量和法西斯雇佣兵也钻到政权里边来。在布达佩斯几个区内和全国各地都开始了屠杀共产党人和进步人士的白色恐怖。
    反革命事件对匈牙利人民造成了严重的损失，使他们的社会主义建设暂时地遭到挫折。反革命虽然造成了损失，但是还提供了对目前发展已经是有益的、将来也还可以利用的经验。
    我们最重要的经验可能是，对已经跑到敌人阵营中去的叛徒不应该去劝说，而是应该作为敌人来消灭。对待反革命不应该妥协，而是应该斗争。对付吃人的老虎不能用肉块而只能用枪口瞄准的办法才能使它驯服。有了这样的教训，忠实于社会主义的匈牙利人民的力量在严重的时刻团结起来，同背叛行为和反革命进行斗争。动员广大的人民群众为保卫人民政权、保卫十二年的斗争成果和社会主义的未来而战斗。
    忠实于社会主义、忠实于社会主义最根本的原则——工人阶级国际主义的匈牙利工人、矿工、合作社农民、个体农民和进步知识分子站了起来，并且在苏联、中国和其他兄弟的社会主义国家人民的帮助下在匈牙利卓越地保卫了社会主义和和平事业。恢复了匈牙利人民共和国的宪法秩序和正常生活，组织了革命的武装，国家机构照常工作，军队坚守着自己的岗位，并且还成立了新的、人民的武装部队——工人自卫队。政权部门对于有过反人民活动的犯罪分子，对于进行过杀人劫夺和放火活动的人追究了责任。
    我们的生产工作是有成绩的。今年8月份工业产量已经达到去年平均每月产量的101％，劳动生产率已经达到97％。农民精心地耕作了土地，今年粮食谷物的收成比去年还要好些。被反革命搞垮的一千七百个农业生产合作社，其中有一千四百个已经重新组织了起来。
    不能说，我们所有的问题都已经得到解决。但是历史也锻炼了我们的党，我们的国家和我们的人民，因此我国人民对未来充满了信心。
    纳吉集团夸大党的错误，反对党的领导，最后实行了可耻的叛变
    党和政府有着基本的劳动群众的信任和支持，5月间匈牙利国民议会一致地批准了工农革命政府所有的措施，其中包括苏联政府的军事援助问题，并且通过了政府关于今后政治、经济、文化任务的纲领。
    我们也把有关纳吉·伊姆雷集团的经验列入重要教训之中。国际工人运动中的反右派斗争都有着相似的经验，相互冲突的阶级力量是相同的，他们的策略和所采取的方法也都是相同的。纳吉·伊姆雷集团在1953年开始向党进攻，取得了党内的领导地位。他们夸大党的领导的错误，起初污蔑以后完全怀疑人民民主政权的成就。纳吉·伊姆雷之流并不是反对错误，而是反对党和党的领导作用，反对党的团结，最后反对整个无产阶级专政。
    他们反党的修正主义思想和帝国主义者的策略是完全一模一样的。这个思想上的进攻几乎扩展到人民政权的各个方面。其中一个基本的特点是：最初开始讨论，以后否定工人阶级的领导作用以及阻挠工人阶级领导作用的具体实现，并且宣称，领导权应该交给知识分子。他们否定实行社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造政策的必要性，否定对一切人民民主国家都有效的社会主义建设的一般规律，借口尊重民族的特点而发展成为资产阶级民族主义。这个集团就这样合乎逻辑地发展成为人民政权的叛徒和反革命了。
    这个情况清楚地说明了在中国共产党内由毛泽东同志作出的关于人民内部矛盾在某种情况下可以转化成为敌我之间的、对抗性的矛盾的这一论点的正确性。
    纳吉·伊姆雷在几年前的修正主义论点，当时还能够看作是人民内部的矛盾，以后发展到否定党的领导作用和反苏的资产阶级民族主义，他们采用宗派主义的方法，必然会跑到帝国主义——资本主义敌人阵营方面去。
    叛徒出卖工人运动的事业这并不是第一次，但是像纳吉·伊姆雷之流这样可憎恶的背叛行为，在工人运动中是少见的。他的信徒和保卫者的背叛行为是在所谓“民族共产主义”的旗帜下进行的。但是，经验是这样，阶级敌人在这类叛徒的帮助下能够造成很大的危害，然而他们却无法改变社会主义的历史道路。
    斗争当然还要继续进行，反革命力量一部分已经消灭，一部分逃亡国外，一部分分散地转入了地下。叛徒们已经从党和重要的国家机关中清除出去，但是帝国主义者仍然存在，他们在匈牙利所遭受的失败引起了他们极大的恼怒。他们不会放过任何一个进攻匈牙利人民共和国的机会。
    用联合国名义组成的五国委员会和围绕五国委员会引起的吵嚷就是这样。联合国召开了一个星期的特别会议，讨论了由帝国主义者阴谋制造出来的所谓匈牙利问题，而不去讨论事实上确实存在并且需要解决的有世界政治意义的事件，如中国在联合国的代表权问题，他们认为只要花一个钟点的讨论和表决就可以解决这个问题。这种情况令人感到遗憾，并且也不会提高联合国的威信。
    帝国主义者的指责是暂时的，是自我陶醉，反对匈牙利人民共和国的毫无根据的控告不再列入联合国议事日程上的日子一定会到来，正像不能很久地把中华人民共和国摒除在联合国之外一样。
    保持工人阶级及其政党的领导，是全体人民的切身利益
    我们匈牙利人执行着我们党和政府的政策，生活已经证明这种政策的总的路线是正确的。
    我们要保卫并且加强党的领导作用，因为匈牙利的反革命进攻再一次证明，如果削弱了工人阶级革命的、马克思列宁主义的政党的领导作用，工人阶级的政权就会陷入危险的境地。
    我们要保卫并且加强党的团结、党的纪律、党内民主和同群众经常的、紧密的、生动的联系。
    我们的例子证明，在建设社会主义的国家里，党站在自己的岗位上，负担起历史所赋予它的领导作用，这是符合于整个人民、整个社会和每一个公民的利益的。
    我们知道，保卫党就是保卫人民的安宁、社会主义的发展、民族的主权和国家的独立。工人阶级和工人阶级的革命政党全部担负起并且保持自己的领导地位不仅是共产党人的而且是整个人民、整个国家的切身利益。当然，党只有依靠群众，赢得群众的信任和赞同才能起这种作用。这是十月事件的重要教训之一。
    我们要从两方面来坚决加强起着无产阶级专政作用的人民民主国家。一方面是人民和人民的政权对敌人的惩办和限制，一方面是发展和保卫群众的民主权利和争取群众经常的支持。
    我们要加强国家的力量和国家机构，同时要防止国家机构中官僚主义的滋长。
    我们要改进国家在经济方面的领导和组织工作，以便在反革命造成了物质上的损失的情况下，还能够保持人民的生活水平。我们要发展生产，以便今后在这个基础上根据实际的可能提高人民生活水平。
    无产阶级国际主义是各社会主义国家人民之间的友谊的最强大因素
    亲爱的同志们：
    帝国主义在匈牙利制造的反革命把主要火力集中地向无产阶级国际主义、同苏联的联盟、华沙条约和建设社会主义的各国人民的团结进攻。因此，我们认为加强匈牙利劳动人民群众的国际主义精神是保卫匈牙利人民共和国利益的主要任务。
    帝国主义者反对中印两国协定中首次宣布的著名的五项原则的实现。我们尊重和平共处的五项原则。我们认为，这些原则可以在具有不同内部制度的两个国家的关系中实现，而且也将在愈来愈广的范围内得到实现。
    同时，我们认为，无产阶级国际主义的原则也得到了进一步的发展。过去每个人都把无产阶级国际主义理解为工人阶级革命政党之间的以及工人群众越过国家界线的国际团结。
    在我们的时代里，当社会主义已经成为一个世界体系而存在的时候，当许多国家的人民在自己的国家中建设社会主义的时候，无产阶级国际主义的原则就成了社会主义国家和建设社会主义的各国人民的关系中最深刻的本质问题了。
    在社会主义阵营内部，无产阶级国际主义就意味着各国人民兄弟的同盟、深厚的、不可分裂的友谊，并且进一步意味着共同的命运。这比和平共处的著名的五项原则要更深刻一些。
    为了反对某些观点，在我们那里，有这样一种看法，这种看法认为在社会主义国家之间的关系中，也应该实现互不干涉内政和其他四项原则，但是在这里这就不够了。我们有共同的喜悦和共同的忧虑。我们体会到，匈牙利人民在受到考验的时候的忧虑和痛苦也是社会主义阵营各国人民共同的忧虑和痛苦。因此我们要努力把无产阶级国际主义的精神贯彻到匈牙利人民的心中。无产阶级国际主义是建设社会主义各国人民之间的友谊的最强大的内部因素。
    在无产阶级国际主义精神下团结一致的社会主义阵营的存在，在社会主义阵营的前列有像苏联和中国这样爱好和平的社会主义大国，这对整个人类都是有利的。这个团结一致的力量是世界和平最有力的保卫者和社会进步事业的国际支柱。
    亲爱的听众们：
    无产阶级国际主义的思想把相距很远的我们中匈两国人民联结在一起。就是这个思想使我们来到这里参加这次大会。
    我可以这样说，匈牙利人民对于在共产党领导下的中国人民和中国人民在人民共和国建立后的年代中所取得的巨大成就怀着崇高的敬意和热爱。
    我们知道，过去的中国是落后的半殖民地的国家，90％的工业掌握在外国帝国主义和同它勾结的官僚资产阶级的手里，80％的土地掌握在一小撮大地主的手里。
    今天，绝大部分的工业是人民的、社会主义的财产，95％的耕地是参加生产合作社的农民在耕种。
    我们代表团中有些人已经不是第一次到中国了。我个人也是第二次了，我亲眼看到了这种迅速的发展。前几天，我们看到了新的、用最先进的技术装备起来的、工作得很好的工厂，世界上任何一个国家和人民有了这样的工厂，都会感到骄傲。
    我们参观了农业生产合作社，出席了在北京的大学中举行的会议，从头到尾看到了难忘的“十一”节日的游行。我们到处都看到，人们是热情的、有纪律的、他们的生活是有内容的，他们相信自己的力量并且同他们的领袖融合在一起。
    中华人民共和国存在着，它是强大的，并且正在健康地向前发展，它是国际生活中最有威信的因素之一，今天世界上任何一个重大的问题没有它就不能够决定。这是美帝国主义者所不愿承认的巨大的现实因素之一。虽然如此，中华人民共和国存在着，而且愿意同它合作的国家的数目不断增加，这是人类庆幸的事情。
    我们匈牙利人对我们的正义事业怀着信心，我们对经过了巨大风浪的我们的人民共和国的进一步加强和它的社会主义未来是充满信心的。
    我们对于进一步加强建设社会主义的各国的团结，对于伟大的朋友苏联和中华人民共和国也是充满信心的。
    我们相信，社会进步、社会主义和和平的力量是不可战胜的。
    亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的北京同志们：
    我们回国以后，我们将忠实地介绍我们在中国所看到的一切。我们要把在中国所感受到的对匈牙利人民共和国的兄弟般的热爱告诉我国人民。
    我请求你们，把匈牙利劳动人民的谢意转达给北京市的全体劳动人民，感谢他们在我们困难的时候给予匈牙利人民的兄弟援助。
    祝伟大的中国人民胜利和幸福！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    北京市的劳动人民万岁！
    中匈两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    社会主义阵营的团结和它的领导力量苏联万岁！
    和平万岁！
