New Sun and New Moon
— Cheering the Great Forty Years
Ge De

A poet said to me: "Forty years ago, humanity saw a new sun; forty years later, the sky saw a new moon." The new moon refers to the artificial satellite that is currently shocking the world, and the new sun is the birth of the great Soviet Union.

I think this is not only a fervent song, but also a brilliant commentary. The appearance of the new moon further proves the greatness of the new sun. However, the "Western" press only dares to admit the greatness of the "moon," but not the greatness of the "sun."

"This is the first step for mankind to fly to the universe," "Mankind has entered the century of conquering the universe." This statement is universally consistent. But when it comes to why it was the Soviet Union that launched the first artificial satellite, apart from the newspapers of the socialist camp (I include all public opinion that truly represents the voice of the people) that dare to tell the truth, the "Western" newspapers try to avoid this point.

The British "Daily Mail" said: "The East has surpassed the West in this competition." People who have always regarded themselves as civilized admitted that the "backward East" has surpassed the "West." Although this is inevitably sad, they can only yield to the facts. But why did the "East" surpass the "West"? The British "Sunday Express" seems to have found an answer: saying that this is the Soviet Union's "scientists' talent and the genius of the craftsmen." This is certainly undoubted, but "Western" scientists are not incompetent, nor can it be said that the natural climate has affected the growth of their "talent" and "genius." Then, what made the "talent" and "genius" of Soviet scientists develop, and what limited the "talent" and "genius" of "Western" scientists?

From the news from the United States, there are reactions of "frightened out of their wits," "annoyed and disappointed." Why is this? An American senator said that this is "a devastating blow to the reputation of American science, industry, and technology." Is it only because of this that they are "frightened out of their wits," "annoyed and disappointed"? This is a typical bourgeois view. In our view, every advance in science and technology in the world always belongs to all mankind. Is it that only the Soviets will travel to other planets when interstellar transportation is opened up? Only the bourgeoisie will feel that every progress of others, no matter how beneficial it is to human progress, is always a damage to them. "Reputation" is actually just a symbol of "science, industry, and technology." If "science, industry, and technology" are high, then "reputation" will never be defeated. Thus, in the final analysis, the question is still why the Soviet Union's "science and technology" caught up with the United States.

It is said that some people in the United States advocate "summoning senior defense officials and scientists to interrogate them" in order to investigate "why the United States has fallen behind the Soviet Union." In principle, "responsibility" should of course be investigated. But I am afraid that "investigation" will not help. The "responsibility" may even be borne by those who demand "investigation," because it ultimately lies in two different social systems. Aren't those who demand investigation also ardent defenders of the capitalist system?

Forty years ago, feudal imperialist Russia was far behind capitalist America in "science, industry, and technology"; today, forty years later, capitalist America has begun to lag behind socialist Soviet Union. In just forty years, it has shown people that the power of society is far greater than the power of individuals, although the United States has excellent individual scientists, it is unable to change this fact. Conversely, if the United States were also a socialist country, with the original "science, industry, and technology" level of the United States, the achievements in this area in forty years would certainly not be worse than the current Soviet Union. These words are actually the old saying that "Western" people hate the most: "Socialism has incomparable superiority over capitalism." This is the answer to all questions. If you insist on saying that this is a victory or defeat in a scientific competition, I think this victory or defeat began to be laid forty years ago. Thus, it proves that the "sun" is far greater than the "moon."

According to Soviet scholars, this "moon" will eventually "burn out at an altitude of tens of kilometers," but the "sun" will always shine on the world, and will eventually spread all over the globe. "Sun," I cheer for you, because of you, a bigger and more perfect "new moon" will appear in the sky.

    新的太阳和新的月亮
    ——欢呼伟大的四十年
    葛德
    一个诗人对我说：“四十年前，人类出现了一个新的太阳；四十年后，天空出现了一个新的月亮。”新的月亮，指的是目前正震惊全世界的人造卫星，而新的太阳呢，就是伟大苏联的诞生了。
    我以为这不仅是热烈的歌，而且是精彩的评论。新的月亮的出现，愈加证明新的太阳的伟大。然而，“西方”的新闻界，却只敢承认“月亮”的伟大，而不敢承认“太阳”的伟大。
      “这是人类飞往宇宙的第一步”，“人类进入了征服宇宙的世纪”。这说法举世一致。但当说到为什么恰恰是苏联发出了第一颗人造卫星的时候，除了社会主义阵营（我是把一切真正代表人民的声音的舆论都包括在内的）的报纸，敢于说出真实的原因以外，“西方”的报纸是力求避开这点的。
    英国的“每日邮报”说：“这场竞赛中，东方超过了西方”。一贯以文明自居的人，承认了“落后的东方”超过了“西方”，这虽是不免伤心，但也只能迫于事实。但“东方”为什么会超过“西方”呢？英国的“星期快报”似乎找到了一个答案：说这是苏联的“科学家的才华和工艺大师的天才”。这当然是无疑的，然而“西方”的科学家并不低能，也不能说是自然气候影响了他们“才华”和“天才”的成长。那末，是什么使苏联科学家的“才华”和“天才”得以发展，又是什么使“西方”科学家的“才华”和“天才”受了限制呢？
    从美国传来的消息中，有着“吓得魂不附体”“恼怒和失望”的反映，这又是为什么呢？美国的一个参议员说这是“对美国的科学、工业和技术的名声一个毁灭性打击”。难道仅仅因为这个就会使得他们“魂不附体”“恼怒和失望”吗？这倒是典型的资产阶级观点。在我们看来，世界上科学技术的每一进步，其功果总是属于全人类的。难道星际间的交通打开了，到其他星球上旅行的只是苏联人？只有资产阶级才会感到别人的每一进步，不管是多么有益于人类的进步，总是对他们的损害。“名声”其实也只是“科学、工业和技术”的符号，“科学、工业和技术”是高的，“名声”便永也打不倒。这样归根结底，问题还是为什么苏联的“科学技术”赶到了美国的前头。
    据说美国有人主张“把高级国防官员和科学家召来加以质询”，以追究“美国为什么落后于苏联的责任。”按理“责任”当然应该追究。不过我怕“追究”也还无济于事。这“责任”恐怕连要求“追究”的人也要担负一份的。因为它归根结蒂还在两种不同社会制度上。要求追究的人不也正是资本主义制度的狂热的维护者吗？
    四十年前封建帝国主义的俄国，曾在“科学、工业和技术”水平上，远远落后于资本主义的美国；四十年后的今天，资本主义的美国，开始落后于社会主义的苏联了。仅仅四十年，就向人们说明了社会的力量远比个人的力量为大，尽管美国有着优秀的科学家个人，却无力改变这事实。不妨反过来想一想，美国如果也是一个社会主义国家，以美国原有的“科学、工业和技术”水平，四十年间，这方面的成就，也决不会比现在苏联差吧。这番话其实就是“西方”人最头痛的那句老话：“社会主义较之资本主义有无比的优越性。”这也是所有问题的答案。硬要说这是一种科学竞赛上的胜负的话，我以为这胜负远在四十年前就开始奠定了。从而它又证明了“太阳”远比“月亮”还伟大。
    据苏联学者们说，这个“月亮”终于要“在几十公里的高空烧毁”，但“太阳”却要永远照耀人间，而且终将遍及全球。“太阳”啊，我向你欢呼，由于你，天空将出现更大更完美的“新月亮”。
