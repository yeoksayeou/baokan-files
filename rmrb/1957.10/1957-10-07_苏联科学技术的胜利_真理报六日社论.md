The news of a new outstanding victory for Soviet science and technology shocked the world yesterday. As a result of the extremely intensive work of various scientific research institutes and design institutes in our country, the world's first artificial satellite was created. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched the first satellite. This satellite is now orbiting the earth in an ellipse at a speed of approximately 8,000 meters per second, completing one revolution in one hour and thirty-six point two minutes.

	This new victory of the creative thinking of our scientists and experts is a logical link in a series of great achievements of Soviet science and technology. Soviet scientists have shown with many examples that they are good at solving the most important scientific and technical tasks in the shortest possible time. Everyone knows that since 1954, the Soviet Union has had the world's first atomic power station, and many new atomic power stations are currently under construction. We have built the world's largest particle accelerator - the synchrophasotron. Not long ago, a super-long-range intercontinental multi-stage ballistic missile was successfully launched, which flew at an unprecedented altitude and was able to accurately land at a predetermined location.

	Now the launch of artificial satellites has opened the first window to the universe, to the world's space, which has realized an idea of the outstanding Soviet scientist Tsiolkovsky. This, not long ago, if not a fantasy, was at least a distant matter.

	Soviet science is step by step, successfully solving the tasks it faces - to gain the world's leading position in science. This is an inevitable result, because no other social system cares about the development of science as much as the socialist system does. With the constant and effective support of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, our scientists have achieved outstanding achievements in many scientific departments. At the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the people expressed their deep gratitude for the outstanding work of Soviet scientists.

	The successful launch of the first artificial earth satellite has made the most significant contribution to the world's scientific and cultural treasure. It is no exaggeration to say that since the launch of the artificial earth satellite, the development of science and technology has entered a new stage, which shows that people have overcome the enormous geocentric gravity, which is a new era in the development of knowledge about the earth and the atmosphere and about cosmic space.

	This extremely great scientific event of the successful launch of artificial earth satellites in our country has shocked the world. The Soviet people commend with deep satisfaction this new achievement of our science, technology and socialist industrialization. The maturity of socialist industrialization makes it powerful enough to solve the most complex technical problems.

	When describing the great prospects of future socialist construction at the Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets, Lenin said: "In the past, all human wisdom and talent were created only to enable a part of the people to obtain all the achievements of technology and culture, while making another part of the people unable to get the most necessary things - education and development. Now, all technical miracles and cultural achievements have become the property of the whole people, and from now on, human wisdom and talent will never be used as a means of oppression and a means of exploitation."

	The Soviet people praise those Soviet scientists who have contributed all their strength and knowledge and all scientific and cultural achievements that benefit the working people. The Soviet people believe that the new great achievement of Soviet science is a guarantee for the further development of the fruitful creation of Soviet scientists and experts for the benefit of peace and progress. Only the working people of the socialist camp and all progressive mankind understand these achievements in this way.

	Today, "Pravda" published the reactions of China, Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Britain, France, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan and other countries to the TASS communiqué on the launch of the world's first artificial earth satellite. Everywhere is commenting on this event, considering it the greatest achievement of Soviet scientists in opening a new era in science. Many foreign scientists and newspapers have emphasized that Soviet scientists have defeated the United States in the peaceful competition.

	The prophecy of the great Soviet scientist Tsiolkovsky has been fulfilled. In his later article, he revealed the future of aviation and rocket technology, and he wrote: "I am firmly convinced of this - the victor will be the Soviet Union." Artificial earth satellites will open a path for interstellar travel. It can be foreseen that our generation will surely see with our own eyes how the free and conscious labor of the people in the new socialist society will turn mankind's boldest ideals into reality.

### 苏联科学技术的胜利——真理报六日社论

    苏联科学技术的胜利
    ——真理报六日社论
    苏联科学技术获得新的杰出胜利的消息昨天轰动了全世界。由于我国各科学研究所和设计院极其紧张工作的结果，创造了世界上第一颗人造卫星。1957年10月4日，苏联成功地发射出了第一颗卫星。现在这颗卫星以每秒约八千公尺速度绕着地球作椭圆形运转，绕行一周为时一小时三十六点二分钟。
    我国科学家和专家的创造思想的新胜利是苏联科学技术一系列巨大成就中的一个合乎规律的环节。苏联科学家用许多事例表明了他们善于在最短的时期里解决各种最重要的科学技术任务。大家都知道，从1954年起，苏联就有了世界上第一个原子能发电站，目前正在建设许多新的原子能发电站。我们建成了世界上最大的粒子加速器——同步稳相加速器。还在不久以前，成功地发射了超远程洲际多级弹道火箭，它在空前未有的高度飞行，并且能够准确地落到预定地点。
    现在人造卫星的发射打开了通向宇宙、通向世界空间的第一窗口，这就实现了苏联杰出的科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基的一个思想。这在不久以前即使不是幻想，也至少是遥远的事情。
    苏联科学一步步地、成功地解决着它所面临的任务——获得世界科学的首位。这是必然的结果，因为没有任何一种其他的社会制度像社会主义制度这样地关心科学的发展。在共产党和苏联政府的经常有效的支持下，我们的科学家在许多科学部门都获得了杰出的成就。在苏共第二十次代表大会上，人民对苏联科学家的卓著成效的工作表示深切的感谢。
    成功地发射第一颗人造地球卫星对世界科学文化宝库作出了最巨大的贡献。可以毫不夸张的说，从人造地球卫星发射的时候起，科学技术的发展进入了一个新的阶段，它表明人们战胜了巨大的地心吸力，这是一个关于地球和大气以及关于宇宙空间学识发展的新纪元。
    在我们国内发射人造地球卫星成功的这个极伟大的科学事件，轰动了全世界。苏联人民怀着深为满意的心情表彰我们这个科学、技术和社会主义工业化的新成就。社会主义工业化成熟的程度使它有力量解决最为复杂的技术问题。
    列宁在全俄第三次苏维埃代表大会上描述未来的社会主义建设的伟大远景时说：“从前，全部人类的智慧和天才进行创造只是为了让一部分人获得全部技术和文化的成果，而使另一部分人得不到最必需的东西——受教育和发展。而现在，一切技术奇迹和文化成果都变成全民的财产，从现在起，人类的智慧和天才永远不再会成为压迫的手段和剥削的手段了。”
    苏联人民赞扬那些贡献出自己全部力量和知识的苏联科学家们和造福于劳动人民的一切科学文化成果。苏联人民认为，苏联科学新的伟大成就是进一步发展苏联科学家和专家的有成效的创造以利于和平和进步的保证。只有社会主义阵营各国劳动人民和全体进步人类才这样理解这些成就。
    “真理报”今天登载了中国、波兰、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫、英国、法国、美国、德意志联邦共和国、意大利、日本以及其他国家对塔斯社关于发射世界上第一颗人造地球卫星的公报的反应。到处都在评论这个事件，认为这是苏联科学家在科学方面开辟新纪元的最大成就。外国许多科学家和报纸强调指出，苏联科学家在和平竞赛中战胜了美国。
    苏联伟大的科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基的预言已经应验了。他在他的后期一篇文章中揭示了航空和火箭技术的未来，他写道：“我坚信这样一点——胜利者必将是苏联”。人造地球卫星将为星际旅行开辟一条道路。可以预料，我们这一代人一定会亲眼看到在社会主义新社会中人们的自由和自觉的劳动是怎样使人类最大胆的理想变为现实的。
