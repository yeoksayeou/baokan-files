    Textile Industry Ministry's Anti-Rightist Struggle Achieves Major Victory
    Middle-of-the-Road Masses Turn Left, Rightists Begin to Surrender

    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Through more than three months of anti-Rightist struggle, the more than 2,400 staff members of the Ministry of Textile Industry have thoroughly smashed the anti-Party, anti-People, and anti-socialist schemes of the Rightists in the Ministry. More than twenty Rightists, including Luo Xumu, Wu Houfu, Li Jianzhang, and Yuan Xueyai, have bowed their heads and confessed their crimes.

    During the period of extensive airing of views and big contending, Rightists in the Ministry of Textile Industry, under the guise of Marxism-Leninism not being able to replace specific business, possessing class struggle talent not necessarily being able to handle contradictions among the people, and struggling against nature, demanded that veteran cadres "give way to the virtuous," and attacked the Party's leadership in the Ministry of Textile Industry. The reactionary words and deeds of the Rightists aroused the righteous indignation of the broad masses of staff members. In hundreds of debate and criticism meetings held in more than forty large and small units of the Ministry, many people presented facts based on their personal experiences and reasoned things out, effectively refuting the Rightists. They listed the facts that in the eight years since the founding of New China, in addition to restoring the original equipment and improving production capacity, China's textile industry has newly established seventy large-scale textile factories with modern equipment. The newly built cotton textile industry alone is equal to half of all the equipment built in old China in half a century. Equipment that used to rely on imports from abroad before liberation can now not only be completely self-sufficient, but also exported abroad. These facts left the Rightists, who attempted to obliterate the achievements of New China's textile industry, speechless. Zhuang youth Zhang Xian cited the fact that a power plant had been built in her hometown and that her family had installed electric lights, powerfully refuting the reactionary fallacy of the Rightists that "the present is not as good as the past."

    One of the main gains of the Ministry in the anti-Rightist struggle was that all staff members received a widespread and profound socialist ideological education. More than half of the comrades in units such as the Capital Construction Design Company took the initiative to examine their confused thinking and erroneous understanding. They expressed their determination to overcome sentimentalism, draw a clear line with the Rightists, and actively participate in the struggle. Xiao Yuexiang of the Capital Construction Design Company said after participating in the debate, "Now I know that we are like people who are in the midst of flowers but do not know their fragrance." Through participation in writing big-character posters, compiling wall newspapers, and blackboard newspapers, the political and ideological level of the broad masses of middle-of-the-road people has generally improved.

    At present, all staff members of the Ministry of Textile Industry are pursuing the victory and striving for a complete and thorough victory in the anti-Rightist struggle.

    纺织工业部反右派斗争获得重大胜利
    中间群众左转　右派开始投降
    本报讯　纺织工业部的二千四百多名工作人员，经过三个多月的反右派斗争，已经彻底粉碎了该部右派分子反共、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋，罗虚牧、吴厚夫、李建彰、袁雪崖等二十多个右派分子已低头认罪。
    在大鸣大放期间，纺织工业部的右派分子在马列主义不能代替具体业务、拥有阶级斗争才能不一定能处理人民内部矛盾和向自然作斗争的幌子下，要老干部“退让贤路”，攻击纺织工业部党的领导。右派分子的反动言行激起了广大工作人员的义愤。在该部大小四十多个单位召开的数百次以上的辩论会、批判会上，许多人以亲身经历摆事实，讲道理，有力地驳斥了右派分子。他们列举出：新中国成立后的八年当中，我国纺织工业除了恢复原有的设备并提高了生产能力外，还新建立七十个规模巨大的、拥有近代化设备的各种纺织厂，其中新建的棉纺织工业，即等于旧中国在半个世纪内建设起来的全部设备的一半。解放前一向依靠从国外进口的设备，现在不仅已能完全自给，而且还向国外出口。这些事实，驳得企图抹煞新中国纺织工业成就的右派分子哑口无言。僮族青年张贤又举出在她的老家已有了发电厂，她家也安上了电灯的事实，有力地驳斥了右派分子所谓“今不如昔”的反动谬论。
    该部在反右派斗争中的主要收获之一，就是全体工作人员受到了一次广泛的、深刻的社会主义思想教育。基建设计公司等单位有半数以上的同志，主动地检查了糊涂思想与错误认识。表示决心克服温情主义，与右派分子划清界限，积极参加斗争。基建设计公司的萧月祥参加了辩论会以后说：“现在才知道我们是身在花中不知香。”广大的中间群众，通过参加出大字报、编写墙报、黑板报，政治思想水平普遍提高一步。
    目前，纺织工业部的全体工作人员正在乘胜追击，以争取反右派斗争全面的、彻底的胜利。
