To strengthen labor education for students and support the autumn harvest and planting season, middle schools in various regions have organized students to participate in voluntary labor in the countryside. Through practical labor, each student receives a profound and vivid socialist ideological education.

During the busy autumn harvest season, Beijing Experimental Middle School, Beijing No. 8 Middle School, and Beijing No. 3 Girls' Middle School, among others, organized students to participate in labor in the agricultural cooperatives of Sanlihe, Luodaozhuang, Hongqi, Guogongzhuang, Wanshousi, and Yangfangdian in the suburbs of Beijing. They helped cooperative members dig sweet potatoes, pull peanuts, pick peanuts, pick hyacinth beans, pull radishes, level the ground, and harvest rice. One class from Beijing No. 8 Middle School alone picked more than 3,000 catties of hyacinth beans, pulled peanuts from 25 mu, and picked more than 3,000 catties of peanuts in two and a half days. Students from Hangzhou No. 4 Middle School, No. 9 Middle School, and No. 11 Middle School went to the Sijiqing, Qianjiang, and Hongxing agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Hangzhou to help cooperative members pull jute, peel jute, turn the soil, and harvest vegetables.

Middle schools in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region organized students to help cooperative members harvest field crops, lift sugar beets, pick soybeans, and pull radishes. The First Junior Middle School in Fuxin County, Liaoning Province, had an agricultural holiday, and students who lived in rural areas returned home to participate in the autumn harvest. The school organized more than 270 students in the city to help with the autumn harvest in the Guoqiang and Zhao Dabayingzi agricultural cooperatives in Zhala Township. They harvested more than 9 shang of sorghum, pulled peanuts from 10 shang, and stacked 26 shang of millet.

In drought-stricken areas such as Shandong and Henan provinces, students actively helped farmers fight drought and sow wheat. According to incomplete statistics, students from 29 primary and secondary schools, including Tengxian No. 1 Middle School, Chengwu No. 1 Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, and Laiyang Normal School in Shandong Province, helped farmers irrigate more than 1,000 mu of wheat in one day of labor. Students from Xuchang No. 1 High School in Henan Province helped farmers irrigate, harrow, plow, and sow a total of more than 1,200 mu of land in four days of labor from October 10th to 13th.

Students who participated in the labor also used their rest time to talk with farmers, visit elderly farmers, and establish friendships with farmers. Beijing Experimental Middle School, Hangzhou No. 2 Middle School, No. 6 Middle School, and other schools have established contact with agricultural cooperatives and will regularly participate in voluntary labor in these agricultural cooperatives in the future.

    加强劳动教育　支援秋收秋种
    各地中学生下乡义务劳动
    本报讯　为了对学生加强劳动教育，各地中学纷纷组织学生下乡参加义务劳动，通过劳动实践，使每个学生受到深刻的生动的社会主义思想教育。
    在秋收农忙季节，北京实验中学、北京市八中和北京市女三中等学校都分别组织学生到北京市郊区三里河、罗道庄、红旗、郭公庄、万寿寺和羊房店等农业社参加劳动。他们帮助社员刨地瓜、拔花生、摘花生、摘扁豆、拔萝卜、平地和割稻子。北京市八中仅一个班在两天半的时间里，摘扁豆三千多斤，拔花生二十五亩，摘花生三千多斤。杭州市四中、九中和十一中等学校的学生分别到杭州市郊区四季青、钱江和红星等农业社帮助社员拔络麻，剥络麻，翻土整地，收割青菜。
    内蒙古自治区各地中学都分别组织学生到农业社帮助社员收割大田作物，起甜菜，拣大豆，拔萝卜。辽宁省阜新县第一初级中学放了农忙假，家在农村的学生都回家参加秋收。学校组织在城市的学生二百七十多人，到札兰乡国强和赵大巴营子两个农业社帮助秋收。他们一共割了九垧多高粱，拔了十垧花生，码了二十六垧谷子。
    在山东、河南等省抗旱地区，学生积极帮助农民抗旱种麦。据不完全统计，山东省滕县一中、城武县一中、二中和莱阳师范等二十九个中小学校的学生，在一天的劳动中，帮助农民浇种小麦一千多亩。河南省许昌第一高中学生，在10月10日到13日的四天劳动中，帮助农民浇地、耙地、犁地和种地共计一千二百多亩。
    参加劳动的学生还利用休息时间跟农民谈心，访问老年农民，和农民建立了友谊。北京实验中学、杭州市二中、六中等学校，都和农业社建立了联系，今后定期到这些农业社参加义务劳动。
