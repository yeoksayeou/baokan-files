    The Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, located in the South Caucasus, is a mountainous country with the highest elevation. It can be said that there are no lowlands here, as the lowest point is more than 900 meters above sea level. Lake Sevan is over 1,900 meters above sea level.

    For many centuries in the past, Armenia was the target of foreign invaders, suffering the most from the oppression of Turkey and Iran. It remained a backward border area until the establishment of Soviet power in 1920.

    During the Soviet era, it has been built into an advanced industrial and collective agricultural republic. Armenia, which used to have only wineries, has now built many industrial sectors such as power, chemical, machine manufacturing, and textile industries. Products include generators, hydraulic turbines, mobile power station equipment, and metal-cutting lathes. More than 100 large enterprises have been built since the war alone. The total industrial output in 1956 was 45 times that of 1913, and electricity production was 450 times that amount. The per capita electricity production has surpassed France and the Netherlands, and is twice as much as Italy, Japan, and Turkey.

    Armenia has been a country that has cultivated grapes and made wine for a long time. Now its vineyards and orchards are also flourishing with the development of agriculture. There are now 900 collective farms in the republic, and the cultivated land area has expanded by 4.3 times compared to 1913.

    Armenia, which had no universities before the revolution, now has twelve institutions of higher learning and more than 1,100 primary and secondary schools. There are now an average of 24 doctors and 6.3 hospital beds for every thousand Armenians, while Turkey, which is 19 times larger and has 14 times the population, has an average of only 0.3 doctors and one hospital bed per thousand people.

    Armenia is also rich in beautiful building stones, such as rose-colored and green tuff, various colored granites and marbles. In Moscow, you can see houses built with Armenian stone.

    The capital Yerevan concentrates half of the republic's entire industry. However, before the revolution, it only had a brandy factory with 100 workers and a population of only 30,000 people. Now it has become a beautiful industrial and cultural center with a population of nearly 400,000.

    山地上的共和国——亚美尼亚
    位于南高加索的亚美尼亚，是个山岭环绕的国家，地势最高。这儿可以说没有低地，因为最低的地方海拔都有九百多公尺。谢凡湖的海拔竟在一千九百公尺以上。
    过去的许多世纪，亚美尼亚都是外国侵略者的对象，遭受土耳其和伊朗的压迫最多。直到1920年苏维埃政权建立时，一直是个落后的边区。
    在苏维埃政权年代，它已建设成为一个先进的工业和集体农业的共和国。在过去只有酿酒厂的亚美尼亚，已建起了动力、化学、机器制造、纺织等许多工业部门。产品有发电机、水力涡轮、移动电站设备、金属切削车床等。仅战后就修建了一百多个大企业。1956年的工业产品总量为1913年的四十五倍，电力生产则为四百五十倍。电力生产按人口计算，已赶过了法国和荷兰，比意大利、日本、土耳其均多一倍。
    亚美尼亚是很久以来就栽植葡萄与酿酒的国家。现在它的葡萄园和果园随着农业的发展，也蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。现在共和国有九百个集体农庄，耕地面积已比1913年扩大了四点三倍。
    革命前没有一所大学的亚美尼亚，现在已有十二所高等学校，一千一百多所中小学。现在每一千个亚美尼亚人平均有二十四个医生和六点三张病床，而面积比它大十九倍、人口比它多十四倍的土耳其，每一千人平均才有零点三个医生和一张病床。
    亚美尼亚还盛产建筑用的美丽的石料，如玫瑰色的和绿色的凝灰岩，各种彩色的花岗岩和大理石等。在莫斯科就可以看到用亚美尼亚石料所建的房屋。
    首都埃里温集中了共和国全部工业的一半。可是革命前它只有一个有一百名工人的白兰地酒厂，人口只有三万人。现在它已成为拥有近四十万人口的美丽的工业和文化中心了。
