Prime Minister Daoud's Speech

Your Excellency the Premier, Friends:

I am very pleased to be able to come to our friendly neighbor China and to meet with Your Excellency again.

Your Excellency and the Chinese government have kindly invited me to visit your country and to meet with Chinese leaders and prominent figures. This opportunity gives me great pleasure.

I am deeply moved by the hospitality shown to me and my companions by the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the Afghan government and the Afghan people.

My main purpose in coming to China is to express the goodwill and friendly wishes of the Afghan people to the Chinese people. Holding the same feelings as the Afghan people, I would like to convey this friendship while adding my own sincere good wishes.

The good contacts and friendly relations between Afghanistan and China have always been conducted in an atmosphere of friendship. The development of this good relationship and the achievements made by the Afghan and Chinese governments in maintaining and strengthening the friendship between the two countries demonstrate the sincerity of our two peoples towards each other and their firm belief in the principles of peace, friendship, strengthening good relations between the peoples of the world, mutual respect and trust, which constitute the basic purpose of our two countries' relations.

Your Excellency's friendly visit to Afghanistan has led to a better understanding between us and has left a pleasant and memorable page in the relationship between Afghanistan and China. I hope that this friendly visit I am making to China will revisit and deepen this memory.

The foundation of Afghanistan's foreign relations is to establish and maintain friendship with the peoples of all countries in the world. Afghanistan's traditional policy of neutrality, which it has always followed and still follows, demonstrates the Afghan people's consistent demand for world peace and their will and desire to maintain friendly relations with all countries in the world in a peaceful environment. This goal is accompanied by the Afghan people's hope for world progress and a happy life.

We are working to eliminate poverty in our country, which is a good proof that our government's policy is sincere and that the Afghan people demand world peace and cooperation between the peoples of all countries.

These things are also needed by the whole world, especially by Asian countries, particularly those that have suffered from historical circumstances. The gathering of Asian and African countries in Bandung made this fact clearer and declared it to the whole world. The Afghan government, in accordance with the wishes of our people, supports the Bandung principles, which are in line with the Charter of the United Nations, and therefore in line with the wishes of the people of the whole world. In the view of the Afghan government, China's participation in the Bandung Conference shows that the ideas of Asian and African countries are practical.

The current world situation and the real fear that mankind has created for itself are disturbing. This situation requires us to maintain more material and spiritual composure than at any time in human history.

Countries that have suffered for centuries feel even more compelled to direct the serious attention of people all over the world to eliminating these concerns. We hope that all countries, out of humanity and a sense of responsibility to all mankind, can work in this direction on the basis of respect for the rights of peoples and nations, and contribute their strength and talents to the happiness of the people of the world.

Please allow me once again, through Your Excellency, to express my gratitude for the hospitality extended to us by the Chinese government and the Chinese people. May the friendly relations between Afghanistan and China last forever. I raise my glass to the health of His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai and His Excellency Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China.

### 达乌德首相的讲话

专栏：

    达乌德首相的讲话总理阁下，朋友们：
    我非常高兴能够来到我们的友好的邻邦中国，并且再一次同阁下会面。
    阁下和中国政府友好地邀请我来访问贵国并且同中国的领导人和杰出人物会面，这个机会给了我极大的愉快。
    中国政府和中国人民对于我和我的同伴们的款待，使我深为感动，我愿代表阿富汗政府和阿富汗人民表示感谢。
    我到中国来的基本目的，是向中国人民表达阿富汗人民的善意和友好的愿望。抱着同阿富汗人民一样的感情，我在转达这一友谊的同时，愿加上我个人的诚挚的良好祝愿。
    阿富汗和中国之间的良好接触和友好关系一直在友谊的气氛中进行着。这种良好关系的发展以及阿富汗政府和中国政府在维持和加强两国友谊方面所取得的成就，说明了我们两国人民诚意相待并且坚定地相信和平、友谊、加强世界各国人民之间的良好关系、互相尊重和信任等原则，这些原则构成了我们两国关系的基本目的。
    阁下到阿富汗进行的友好访问，使得我们之间有了更好的了解，并且在阿富汗和中国的相互关系中留下了愉快的值得回忆的一页。我希望我这次到中国来进行的友好访问将重温并且加深这个回忆。
    阿富汗对外关系的基础是建立和维护同世界各国人民的友谊。阿富汗所一直遵循并且仍然是我国传统的中立政策，表明了阿富汗人民一贯要求世界和平以及在和平的环境中同世界各国保持友好关系的意志和愿望。这个目的是同阿富汗人民希望世界进步、生活幸福的愿望相伴而来的。
    我们正致力于消除我国的贫困，这一点很好地证明了我国政府的政策是真诚的，阿富汗人民是要求世界和平和各国人民之间的合作的。
    这些东西也是整个世界所需要的，更是亚洲各国，特别是那些由于历史环境而遭受过苦难的国家所需要的。亚非各国在万隆的集会使这个事实更加清楚并且向全世界作了宣告。阿富汗政府按照我国人民的愿望支持万隆原则，这些原则是符合联合国宪章的，因而也是符合全世界人民的愿望的。在阿富汗政府看来，万隆会议有中国参加，说明了亚非国家的想法是实际的。
    目前的世界局势以及人类给自己制造的实际存在的恐惧是令人不安的，这种情况要求我们比人类历史上任何时代更加保持物质上和精神上的镇定。
    曾经接连几个世纪遭受过苦难的国家，更加感到有必要把全世界人民的认真的注意力导向消除这些忧虑的方向。我们希望所有国家，出于人道和对于全人类的责任感，在尊重人民和各国权利的基础上，能够向这个方向努力，并且为了世界人民的幸福贡献出它们的力量和才能。
    请让我再一次通过阁下表达我对于中国政府和中国人民所给予我们的款待的谢意。愿阿富汗和中国之间的友好关系延绵不绝。我举杯祝周恩来总理阁下和中华人民共和国主席毛泽东阁下的健康。
