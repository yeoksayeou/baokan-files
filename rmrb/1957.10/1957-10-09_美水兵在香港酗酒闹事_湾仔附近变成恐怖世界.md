Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, October 8th: U.S. sailors are constantly causing trouble while drunk in Hong Kong, disrupting Hong Kong's social order and the tranquility of residents.

On the morning of the 7th, four drunken U.S. sailors in Wanchai, Hong Kong, were staggering and chasing each other along the waterfront, knocking over hawkers, urinating in the street with their pants down, and kicking open the back door of the East District Fire Station at Canal Road while shouting loudly. Residents resting in the area were forced to flee.

News published in Hong Kong newspapers indicates that incidents of U.S. sailors causing trouble and harassing residents while drunk have been steadily increasing in recent months.

Hong Kong newspapers report that since a U.S. military pier was established on Fenwick Street in Wanchai in recent years, this area, which used to be a place for local residents to relax, has become a terrifying zone. At night, groups of drunken U.S. sailors wander through the nearby streets, staggering, shouting and singing loudly, insulting passers-by, even assaulting pedestrians and molesting women. Many single women are afraid to pass through these streets at night.

    美水兵在香港酗酒闹事  湾仔附近变成恐怖世界
    据新华社香港8日电　美国水兵不断在香港酗酒闹事，扰乱香港社会秩序和居民安宁。
    7日清晨，四个醉酒的美国水兵在香港湾仔海旁互相颠扑追逐，推倒小贩，当街解裤小便，并踢开鹅颈桥东区消防局的后门高声叫骂，在当地憩息的居民被迫纷纷走避。
    香港报纸登载的消息表明，最近几个月来，美国水兵酗酒闹事骚扰居民的事件正在不断增加。
    香港报纸报道，近年来在湾仔分域街有了一个美军专用码头以后，这个原是当地居民憩息的场所已经变成一个恐怖区域。入夜，吃醉了酒的美国水兵成群结队，在附近街头东倒西歪地游荡，高声地乱叫乱唱，辱骂途人，甚至殴打行人和调戏妇女，许多单身女子晚上都不敢路过这附近街道。
