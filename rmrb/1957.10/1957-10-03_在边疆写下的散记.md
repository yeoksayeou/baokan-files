    Jottings Written on the Frontier
    Gu Gong
    Dwelling

    The regiment commander and political commissar’s tent is like an eagle's nest, built next to a protruding cliff – in this valley full of steep walls, this is already the flattest place.

    They had me sit on a newly constructed bunk, and the regiment commander raised his hand cheerfully to say to me, "What do you think? I'm afraid you haven't seen such a fresh and unique dwelling even on stage!"

    Indeed! This dwelling is really too interesting. A moss-covered rock drills into the tent, occupying one-third of the space; on the side of the bunk, there is also a small tree twisting its slender waist, and a telephone is nailed to the fork of the tree, with the wires winding around the branches, extending out of the top of the tent...; on the other side of the bunk, it is the deep valley that plummets a thousand feet. Even turning over in sleep requires great caution!

    The political commissar stomped his feet with satisfaction and said, "No, you should first look at our floor" -- under this tent, there are logs laid for building floors -- ... "You can search all the high-rise buildings, and I'm afraid you won't find such a thick and solid floor like ours..."

    The political commissar laughed at himself as he said this, and the regiment commander also laughed, laughing so comfortably and clearly. I felt that this laughter contained pride in building the frontier, and praise for overcoming the difficulties of life...

    Notebook

    The regiment commander has a thick notebook that he has carried for fifteen years.

    The first few pages of the notebook are written in crooked handwriting, copying the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention; copying the rights and obligations of Party members; copying the duties of the guards... He said to me with a smile: "This is my achievement after three years of being a soldier..."

    The next few pages record the ideological situation reports of each squad and platoon; record the experience of front-line political work; record the names of all the meritorious heroes and model workers... He said to me even more excitedly: "This is my achievement after six years of being a soldier..."

    The pages after that are covered with various offensive arrows and defensive arcs; covered with his anxiety and unease in the wounded soldier hospital, and gratitude to a female nurse; covered with various strategic and tactical summaries of guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare... He said to me with extraordinary cherish: "This is my achievement after ten years of being a soldier..."

    On the second half of the book, there are vigorous characters and complex graphics: various geometric triangles and various equations, the soldiers' inventions, creations and the number "3.1416"... He slowly closed the notebook and said, "This is what I have done in the past few years, and what I will strive to do in the future..."

    This notebook seems to be a document of great historical value, making it unforgettable to me for a long time. Every page of this notebook is a footprint forward; every page of this notebook is a monument of victory...

    Learning

    Although the chief of staff’s face has been smoked by many wars, it still retains the unique simplicity, kindness, and honesty of Chinese peasants.

    Of course, he will have very rich military struggle knowledge, and very deep class struggle knowledge, as for natural science knowledge? … However, when he occasionally talked about some natural science knowledge, it really stunned me: he not only knows how the lenses of telescopes and camera lenses are made; he not only knows how radars and electronic computers are installed; and he also knows about ancient Chinese architecture and inventions: Li Chun’s stone bridge, Zhang Heng’s seismograph; he even knows who came up with the idea of ​​coating antelope blood on the compass, and who first created the south-pointing chariot...

    Is he a college student? Or has he attended a specialized training class? No, there is nothing, his past, like the past of Chinese peasants, only had tears and scars. He herded pigs at the age of six, herded cattle at the age of ten, was driven to the fields by the landlord with a whip at the age of thirteen, and at the age of fifteen, he followed behind the Eighth Route Army and never wanted to leave... In these fifteen years, he had never held a pen or touched a piece of paper.

    Now, in the snowy night, I saw that his tent was still like a lantern, emitting red light. His guards often anxiously lifted his tent cloth and urged:

    "Chief, you should rest!"

    But he was still reluctant to put down the book, just responding with a "hmm, hmm"...

    These people who are building the frontier are the people who create life and create knowledge.

### 在边疆写下的散记

    在边疆写下的散记
    顾工
    住室
    团长和政委的帐篷，像是苍鹰的窝，构筑在一块突出的悬崖的旁边——在这到处都是陡壁的山谷中，这里已经算是一块最最平坦的地方。
    他俩把一块刚刚搭起来的铺板让我坐，团长并扬起手快活地向我说：“怎么样？你恐怕在舞台上，也没见过这样新鲜、别致的住室吧！”
    是啊！这个住室实在是太有趣了，一块长满青苔的岩石，钻进帐篷里，占据了三分之一的地盘；在铺板的这一边，还长着棵扭着细腰的小树，树杈上钉着一架电话机，电线盘绕着枝梢，一起伸出了篷顶……；在铺板的另一边，却是那一落千丈的深谷。连睡觉翻个身，都要非常小心呢！
    政委满意地踏着脚说：“不，你应该首先看看我们的地板”——在这帐篷的下面，是铺着一根根准备用来架楼的木料——……“你走遍所有的高楼大厦，恐怕也找不出像我们这样厚实、牢固的地板……”。
    政委说到这里，把自己给引笑了，把团长也给引笑了，笑得这样舒畅，笑得这样清朗。我感到：这笑声中是包含着对建设边疆的自豪，包含着对克服生活困难的赞美……。
    笔记本
    团长有一本厚厚的已经背了十五年的笔记本。
    笔记本最前面的几页，用歪歪扭扭的笔迹，抄写着三大纪律，八项注意；抄写着党员的权利和义务；抄写着警卫员的职责……。他笑着对我说：“这是我当兵三年以后的成绩……”
    随后几页就是记录着各个班、排的思想情况汇报；记录着火线政治工作的经验；记录着全连所有功臣、英模的名字……。他更兴奋地对我说：“这是我当兵六年以后的成绩……”
    再后面几页就是涂画着各种各样进攻的箭头和防御的弧线；涂画着他在伤兵医院里的焦急、不安，和对一个女护士的感激；涂画着游击战和运动战的各种战略战术摘要……。他异常珍惜地对我说：“这就是我当兵十年以后的成绩……”
    在后半本上，都是苍劲的字迹和复杂的图形：各种几何形的三角和各种方程式，战士们的发明、创造和“3.1416”的数字……。他慢慢地合上笔记本说：“这就是我这几年所做的，和我今后所要努力的……”。
    这本笔记本，好像是一本极有历史价值的文献，他使我长久地难忘。这笔记本的每一页，都是一个前进的脚印；这笔记本的每一页，都是一块胜利的丰碑……。
    学习
    参谋长的脸，虽然经过很多次硝烟的熏染，但仍然保持着中国农民特有的淳朴、亲切和憨厚。
    当然，他会有很丰富的军事斗争知识，会有很深刻的阶级斗争知识，至于自然科学知识呢？……但是，当他偶然谈到一些自然科学知识时，确实使我惊呆了：他不但知道望远镜的镜片和照相机的镜头是怎么制成的；他不但知道雷达和电子计算机是怎么安装的；而且他还知道中国古代的建筑和发明：李春的石桥、张衡的地震仪；甚至他还知道是谁想出来在指南针上涂上羚羊血，是谁第一个创造出来指南车……
    他是大学生吗？或是他进过专修班吗？没有，什么都没有，他的往日，只是像中国往日的农民一样，只有眼泪和伤痕。他六岁放猪，十岁放牛，十三岁让地主用鞭子赶着下地，十五岁他就跟在八路军的队伍后面，再也不肯离开一步……。在这十五年中，他从来没有捏过一支笔，摸过一张纸。
    现在，在风雪交加的深夜，我看见他的帐篷还是像盏灯笼，透出红红的光。他的警卫员时时忧心地掀开他的篷布催促着：
    “首长，您该休息了！”
    但他仍然舍不得放下书本，只是“嗯，嗯”地漫应着……。
    这些建设边疆的人是创造生活又创造知识的人们。
