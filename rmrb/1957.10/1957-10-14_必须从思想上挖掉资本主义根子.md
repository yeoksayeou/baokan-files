　　The Roots of Capitalism Must Be Dug Out Ideologically

To the Editor:
    After seeing the several "before and after" photos and textual introduction of Liu Jieshui in the People's Daily, memories of the old society's misery immediately flooded my mind. Seeing the broken bowl and tattered gourd for begging, the patched-up long and short garments of the farmhand, and the old mosquito net that had been used for eighty years, it was truly shocking and chilling. Isn't this a true microcosm of old China? The other photos brought me back from unpleasant memories: the carved bed with new floral quilt, the dazzling array of new clothes like opening a clothing company, and Liu Jieshui, standing next to the beggar in his cadre uniform, isn't this a true portrayal of the new China building socialism?
    One person, two images, representing two different eras, reflecting two different social systems; it is truly: "The old society turned people into ghosts, the new society turned ghosts into people."
    If every one of our cadres, or rather, citizens of the new China, took Liu Jieshui's example as a mirror to reflect upon themselves, wouldn't they discover that they have similar shadows?
    Recently, a young man from a farm in the suburbs of Beijing wanted to find work in Shanghai. He began by complaining, "Every one of the comrades from the Third Troupe (referring to our former troupe) is doing better than me." I asked him what specific work he was doing on the farm, and he dejectedly said, "Hoeing!" I said, "Labor is the most glorious thing!" How did he answer? "I'm afraid of labor."
    Doesn't this perfectly illustrate that capitalist ideas still exist and even develop in the minds of many people: they are preoccupied with gains and losses of personal reputation, status, and treatment, while showing little enthusiasm for the great socialist construction cause of creating happiness for 600 million people; they ask the country and the people for more, and contribute very little to the country and the people; in a word: capitalist ideas are strong in their minds, and communist ideas are weak. It is inconceivable that one can enter socialism with bourgeois ideas and serve the socialist cause well or build socialism well.
    Therefore, each of us must ideologically dig out the roots of capitalism in order to happily pass through this socialist stage, and transform ourselves into staunch proletarian fighters who strive for socialist construction and the communist ideal!

### 必须从思想上挖掉资本主义根子

　　必须从思想上挖掉资本主义根子编辑同志：
    我在人民日报上看到关于刘介梅的几张“今昔对比”照片及文字介绍以后，脑子里立刻出现了对旧社会的悲惨回忆。看那讨饭用的破碗烂瓢、补绽片片的长工短袄、曾用过八十年的破旧蚊帐，再进而看到一个面容憔悴、满身褴褛、手拿打狗棍的乞丐形象，真是触目惊心，不寒而栗。这不正是旧中国的真实缩影吗？另几张照片，又把我从不愉快的回忆中唤回来了：雕花大床新花被，像开服装公司一样的琳琅满目的新衣服，那位站在化子旁边的身穿干部服的刘介梅，不正是建设着社会主义的新中国的真实写照吗？
    一个人，两种形象，代表了两个不同的时代，反映了两种不同的社会制度；真所谓：“旧社会把人变成鬼，新社会把鬼变成人”。
    如果我们每一个干部，或者说新中国的公民，大家都拿刘介梅的实例当一面镜子照一照自己的话，何尝发觉不了自己有和他类似的影子呢？
    最近从北京郊区农场来的一位青年，想在上海找工作，开头就抱怨说：“三团（指我们过去的那个剧团）的同志，那一个都比我混的好。”我问他在农场作什么具体工作，他丧气地说：“耪地！”我说：“劳动是最光荣的呀！”他怎样回答呢？“我怕劳动”。
    这不正好说明资本主义思想还在许多人的头脑里存在着，甚至发展着：他们斤斤计较个人名誉、地位、待遇的得失，而对为六亿人民造幸福的伟大社会主义建设事业，则表现热情不高；伸手向国家和人民要的东西多，为国家和人民贡献极少；一句话：脑子里资本主义思想浓厚，共产主义稀薄。不能设想：带着资产阶级思想走进社会主义而能很好的为社会主义事业服务能把社会主义建设好。
    因此，我们每个人都必须从思想上挖掉资本主义根子，才能身心愉快地过好社会主义这一关，才能把自己改造成为社会主义建设和共产主义理想而奋斗的无产阶级的坚强战士！
