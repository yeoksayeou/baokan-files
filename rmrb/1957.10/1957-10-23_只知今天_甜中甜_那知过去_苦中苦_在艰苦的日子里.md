    As the great 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution rapidly approaches, and as people praise and admire the happy lives of the Soviet people, seven old Chinese workers in Tianjin who had participated in the construction of the Soviet Union at different times held a meaningful gathering. They discussed the past when the Soviet people frugally and arduously struggled to create this happy life.

    Some of these seven old Chinese workers had participated in the economic recovery and construction work in the early days of the Soviet Union in the Ussuri Railway region, the famous Lena Gold Mine, and the Far East coal mines. Others participated in the socialist and communist construction of the first to fifth five-year plans in the fisheries of the Sea of Okhotsk, the forests of the Urals, and the factories of Tashkent. Gathering together, these old workers felt as if they had returned to their long-separated and beloved Soviet land, unable to suppress their excitement and stirring up memories of the past.

    Chinese worker Liu Fu, who participated in the October Revolution and joined the Red Army to fight to defend the fruits of the revolution, first recalled the difficult situation in the post-war years, saying: If the Soviet people today are living a life of "sweetness upon sweetness," then at that time, they were enduring days of "bitterness upon bitterness." Almost everything had been destroyed by the war, and industrial products were particularly scarce. People didn't have shoes to wear, so they wrapped their feet in felt and covered them with "bark shoes" woven from tough bark strips; lacking matches, people kept embers in the stove every day and used hemp stalks to relight them the next day; lacking kerosene for lamps, they burned strips of wood for lighting; lacking tobacco, some people often pulled green moss from the shady side of large trees to smoke. Food was also very scarce at that time. Liu Fu said that one year, on the anniversary of the October Revolution, he participated in a parade all day and only got three hundred grams of bread for dinner when he returned home. One day, Liu Fu saw an old man and a woman waiting for a bus at the tram stop. The old man asked the woman if she had any bread and if she could give him some. The woman took out a piece of black bread more than three inches long from her bag and handed it to the old man, saying, "This is my lunch for work." Upon hearing this, the old man returned the bread to her. At this time, Liu Fu took out a handful of soybeans he had saved to satisfy his hunger from his bag and gave them to the old man.

    In such difficult days, was the Soviet people's enthusiasm for labor frustrated? Liu Fu said, not at all. At that time, he was working on the Ussuri Railway. Soviet friends often said to him: "Work hard, and we will be happy!" At that time, workers did not receive wages but worked ten hours a day; however, they exceeded their quotas every day. The workers repairing the lines rushed forward to repair the roadbeds and bridges, quickly restoring the urgently needed railway transportation. Sometimes, a moving train would suddenly stop because the coal had run out, so the train drivers and even the passengers would get out of the train together and go to the nearby forest to transport wood for burning. Not only that, but all local citizens, including workers, students, soldiers, office workers, and housewives, responded to Lenin's call to participate in "Saturday Voluntary Labor Days," pooling their efforts to restore the economic life destroyed by the war.

    After the start of the first five-year plan for socialist construction, people's lives were still difficult. Old worker Liu Qingshan, who worked in coal mines near Vladivostok, Soviet Union, and later worked in the trade union, continued to recall: In order to build socialism, the Soviet Union implemented comprehensive rationing of daily necessities, and nothing was sold, including bread, butter, sugar, cotton cloth, and so on. Because bread needed to be rationed on the same day, hundreds or even thousands of people lined up everywhere early every morning. However, the Soviet working people did not complain. They economized on food and clothing, saving everything that could be saved for the country to export in exchange for construction materials. People had slogans of "not eating" for many good things: "Not eating good flour," "Not eating good fish," "Not eating good fruit," and so on. At that time, Liu Qingshan was on the Soviet Far East coast, which was rich in large crabs and small clear fish, both of which were valuable items on European and American tables. One crab leg or a few fish could make a can. The local people did not eat them at all. After they were caught, they were immediately processed, canned, and exported. After the large crabs caught in the sea northeast of Vladivostok in 1930 were sold to foreign countries, they were exchanged for a batch of ships.

    Old worker Xu Ruicheng, who worked in factories in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, said: By the second five-year plan, especially the third five-year plan, the lives of workers had greatly improved. When he came to the Zhabul City Food Union Factory in the Kazakh Republic in 1937, the factory provided workers with free breakfast every morning: white bread, butter, white sugar, and half a kilogram of milk. Wages increased, welfare benefits also increased, and the lives of workers were thriving. However, they still responded to the call of the Soviet state and adhered to the principle of building the country diligently and frugally. Xu Ruicheng took the candy workshop of the food union factory where he worked as an example, saying that the workshop was newly built due to the demands of improved people's lives. At the beginning, there were only twelve workers and a small pot that could boil one hundred kilograms of sugar. Sugar making was all done manually, and the candies were delivered to various stores by人力车 (a type of two-wheeled passenger cart pulled by a person). The entire workshop had only three small rooms, where workers produced, rested, studied, and ate all in the same place. Under these circumstances, the workers actively developed production. By the second year, they had built twelve new factory buildings, replaced them with large sugar pots of five hundred kilograms, used electric motors for production, and delivered sugar by car, and the number of workers increased to one hundred and eighty. However, the welfare facilities still did not increase. The workers did not raise any complaints about this. By the next year, welfare construction was included in the plan, and spacious dining halls, different bathhouses for winter and summer, and a large club where performances could be held were all built. Xu Ruicheng said: Even at this time, they still paid great attention to thrift. Considering that there were not too many workers here, they converted the lower floor of the club into a warehouse.

    After a long period of hard work, the Soviet people finally achieved wonderful results. Regarding this aspect, lumberjack Cui Shouzheng, who returned to China in 1954, gave the old workers a detailed introduction. He said that although the Soviet Union suffered a huge disaster from the German fascist invasion, it was completely restored after only one five-year plan after the war. When he returned to China, the Soviet workers in the Molotov Oblast no longer had the problem of not having enough bread to eat, but rather could not finish it, because people had to eat a lot of meat and milk every day. The workers lived in large buildings, and some even had self-built houses with orchards and vegetable gardens. Almost every worker's family had a radio, sewing machine, carpet, and sofa bed. The workers wore woolen clothes, only wearing cloth work clothes when working. Because the city was not large, there were not many cars, and the most common means of transportation was motorcycles, which many workers had.

    Cui Shouzheng said: The lives of the Soviet people became prosperous, but they did not forget to be diligent and frugal. They immediately saved the money they saved in the bank to vigorously support communist construction. Cui Shouzheng said that he himself saved 18,000 rubles before returning to China, which was equivalent to ten months' salary.

    只知今天“甜中甜”　那知过去“苦中苦”
    在艰苦的日子里
    新华社记者　尹崇敬　吕素瑄
    当伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年快要到来的时候，当人们在赞扬和羡慕苏联人民过着的幸福生活的时候，天津市有七位曾经先后参加过苏联建设的中国老工人举行了一次有意义的聚会，谈叙了当年苏联人民节衣缩食、艰苦奋斗缔造这种幸福生活的往事。
    这七位中国老工人，有的曾经在乌苏里地区的铁路上，著名的连拿金矿里和远东的煤矿里，参加过苏联建国初期的经济恢复和建设工作；有的在鄂霍次克海的渔场上，乌拉尔的森林里，塔什干的工厂里，参加过第一个到第五个五年计划的社会主义和共产主义建设。这些老工人欢聚在一起，就像重新回到久别的亲爱的苏维埃国土一样，按捺不住兴奋激动的心情，不由得引起了对于往事的回忆。
    参加过十月革命并且为保卫革命成果加入红军投身战斗的中国工人刘福，首先回忆战后年代的艰苦情景说：如果说苏联人民今天过着“甜中甜”的生活，那时则是度着“苦中苦”的日月。当时的一切几乎都遭到战争的破坏，工业品特别缺乏。人们没有鞋子穿，就用毡块把脚包起，外面再用有韧性的树皮条编成的“树皮鞋”笼住；缺乏火柴，人们每天就在炉子里留下火种，第二天用麻杆再把它引着；没有煤油点灯，就用一根根木条燃起来照明；缺乏烟草，有人常常从大树的背荫面扯下那些绿毛毛当烟抽。当时的粮食也非常缺乏。刘福说，有一年十月革命节，他参加了一天游行，晚上回家只吃到三百公分面包。一天，刘福看到一位老人和一个妇女在电车站等车，老人问那妇女有没有面包，能不能给他一些，那个妇女从包里取出一块三寸多长的黑面包递给老人，说了声“这是我上工的午饭”；老人一听，又把那面包还给她。这时，刘福把自己留着充饥的一把黄豆从袋里掏出送给了那位老人。
    在这样艰难困苦的日子里，苏联人民的劳动热情是否受到挫折呢？刘福说，全然没有。当时他已到乌苏里地区铁路上做工。苏联朋友常对他说：“干吧，我们会幸福的！”当时工人都不领工资，一律工作十小时；但是他们每天都超过定额。修复线路的工人一鼓气向前抢修路基桥梁，迅速地把当时最急需的铁路运输恢复起来。有时，正行驶着的火车会突然停下来，原因是煤烧光了，于是火车司机们甚至旅客们都一起下车，到附近的森林里去运来木材再烧。不仅如此，当地的所有公民，包括工人、学生、军人、机关工作者、家庭妇女，都响应列宁的号召，参加“星期六义务劳动日”，群策群力地恢复被战争破坏了的经济生活。
    建设社会主义的第一个五年计划开始以后，人民生活仍然是艰苦的。曾经在苏联海参崴附近的煤矿做工以后又作工会工作的老工人刘清山接着回忆说：为了建设社会主义，苏联的生活用品实行全面配给，面包、奶油、白糖、棉布等等什么都不出售。由于面包需要当天配给，所以每天清早各地都有数百人甚至上千人在排队。但是苏联劳动人民并没有怨言，他们节衣缩食，把一切可以节省的东西省下来给国家出口，换取建设物资。人们对于许多好东西都有“不吃”的口号：“好面不吃”、“好鱼不吃”、“好水果不吃”等等。当时刘清山正在苏联东方海滨，那里盛产大蟹和小清鱼，都是欧美席上的珍贵品。一只蟹的腿或者几条鱼就能做一个罐头。当地人民完全不吃它们，捕捞上来以后立即加工装罐出口。1930年在海参崴东北海上捕的大蟹卖给外国以后，就换回了一批轮船。
    在乌兹别克和哈萨克工厂里做过工的老工人徐瑞成说：到了第二个五年计划特别是第三个五年计划的时候，工人的生活就大有提高了。1937年，他来到哈萨克共和国藏卜路市食品联合工厂的时候，每天早晨工厂都免费供给工人早点：白面包、奶油、白糖，还有半公斤牛奶。工资增加了，福利也多了，工人生活欣欣向荣。但是，他们仍然响应苏维埃国家的号召，坚持勤俭建设的方针。徐瑞成以他所在的这个食品联合工厂的糖果车间为例说，那个车间是由于人民生活提高的要求新建起来的。开始时只有十二个工人和能熬糖一百公斤的小锅，制糖都是用人工，往各个门市部送糖果也是人力车；全车间只有三间小房子，工人生产、休息、学习、吃饭全都在这里面。在这种情况下，工人们积极发展生产，到第二年就盖起了十二间新厂房，换上了五百公斤的大糖锅，使用电动机生产，汽车送糖，工人增加到了一百八十人。可是，福利设施呢，仍然没有增加。工人们对此没有提出任何不满的意见来。到了再下一个年头，福利建设列入计划了，宽大的饭厅、冬季和夏季不同的浴室、能够演戏的大俱乐部，都盖起来了。徐瑞成说：就在这时，他们还十分注意节约，考虑到这里的工人不太多，把俱乐部的楼下一层辟为一座仓库。
    经过了长期艰苦的奋斗，苏联人民终于得到了美好的成果。关于这方面，1954年才回国的伐木工人崔守正向老人们详细地作了介绍。他说，苏联虽然遭受了一次德国法西斯侵略的巨大灾害，但是只经过战后一个五年计划就完全恢复了。当他回国的时候，莫洛托夫州一带的苏联工人，不再有面包不够吃的问题，而是吃不下了，因为人们每天都要吃很多肉和奶。工人们住的是大楼，有些人还有自建的带有果园菜园的住宅。差不多每个工人家里都有收音机、缝纫机、地毯、沙发床。工人们穿的是毛料衣服，只是在工作时才穿布工作服。由于城市不大，小汽车并不多，最多的交通工具是摩托车，许多工人都有。
    崔守正说：苏联人民的生活富裕起来了，但是他们并没有忘记勤俭节约。他们把节省下来的钱立即存到银行里，大力支援共产主义建设。崔守正说，他自己回国前就存了一万八千卢布，相当十个月的工资。
