    The Truth About America's Old Newspaper of Colleagues
    The "New York Herald Tribune," which has been published for 116 years, has always been regarded in the United States as a leading "newspaper of journalists." Over the years, the fact that this newspaper has sold out to monopoly capitalists and acted as a mouthpiece for the American Republican Party has been well known. On September 30, the "New York Herald Tribune" announced that it had accepted investment from Whitney, the big boss of the Mobil Oil Company and the well-known financial magnate, the American Ambassador to the United Kingdom. The true colors of the old newspaper of colleagues were even more fully exposed.
    "Softer, More Lively"
      In 1955, the "New York Herald Tribune" had internal strife. Ogden Reid ousted his brother, Whitelaw Reid, and took over all the power, holding the three positions of president, editor-in-chief, and publisher. Ogden Reid, a 1949 graduate of Yale University, armed with a $2.25 million loan from an insurance company, took drastic measures as soon as he took office, trying to restore the reputation of the old newspaper of colleagues. His slogan was: "Softer, more lively."
    Under the slogan of "softer, more lively," the front page, which had always only published so-called "serious" and "fair" news, began to feature sensational crime news. A former news advertising broker and gossip columnist transformed into an important figure in the newspaper. The layout of the "New York Herald Tribune" did indeed undergo some changes.
    Selling Out
    Under Ogden Reid's "reform" policy, even the ten or so so-called veteran journalists of the "New York Herald Tribune" could not hold their ground and resigned one after another. Some were even poached by "The New York Times." However, the circulation of the old newspaper of colleagues continued to decline. In 1955, the newspaper's highest daily circulation record was 387,276 copies, which dropped to 367,248 copies this year. The circulation of the Sunday edition was 596,308 copies at the beginning of 1956, which dropped to 576,488 copies in the same period this year. Since 1946, the circulation of the "New York Herald Tribune" has decreased by 18%.
    The Reid family took over the "New York Herald Tribune" in 1872. From then on, the family reorganized the newspaper as a joint-stock company, further selling out to capitalists. At the same time, it used the banners of "serious" and "independent" to deceive the public, and gained the title of so-called "newspaper of journalists."
    In order to solve the deteriorating crisis of the "New York Herald Tribune," Ogden Reid had no other magic weapon other than wagging his tail and begging capitalists. In mid-September, Ogden Reid made a special trip to London and personally appealed to Whitney, the big boss of Mobil Oil Company and the American Ambassador to the United Kingdom, simply abandoning the old signboard of the newspaper of colleagues.
    Deceiving Oneself
    According to the Associated Press, the president and editor-in-chief of the "New York Herald Tribune" published Whitney's statement. Whitney said: "...As one of the shareholders of the newspaper, I will not be responsible for the newspaper's business operations and editorial policy work. The newspaper will still be led by the president and editor-in-chief."
    Whitney's statement is completely self-deception. "Time Magazine" published a message on September 23, giving Whitney a heavy slap in the face. "Time Magazine" revealed that Whitney invested $2 million in the "New York Herald Tribune" and said: "In order to soberly monitor the editorial policy under the leadership of Editor-in-Chief and Publisher Reid, the 'New York Herald Tribune' is organizing an advisory committee composed of business leaders and Republican leaders."

### 美国老牌同人报的真相

    美国老牌同人报的真相
    创刊迄今已达一百一十六年的“纽约先驱论坛报”，一向在美国被认为是首屈一指的“新闻工作者同人报”。历年以来，这个报纸向垄断资本家卖身投靠、充当美国共和党的喉舌的事实，本来就是尽人皆知的。9月30日，“纽约先驱论坛报”宣布接受美孚油公司大老板、鼎鼎有名的财阀美国驻英大使惠特尼的投资，老牌同人报的原形就更毕露无遗了。
    “软些，活泼些”
      1955年，“纽约先驱论坛报”起了内哄，奥格登·里德排挤了他的兄长怀特劳·里德，大权独揽，一身兼任社长、总编辑、发行人三个要职。奥格登·里德是耶鲁大学1949年的毕业生，挟着保险公司一笔二百二十五万美元的贷款，一上台就采取了大刀阔斧的手段，力图挽回老牌同人报的声势。他的口号就是：“软些，活泼些。”
    在“软些，活泼些”的口号下，向来只刊登一些所谓“严肃”、“公正”消息的第一版，出现了耸人听闻的犯罪消息，曾经担任过新闻广告经纪人、流言蜚语的杂谈作家摇身一变成为该报重要人物。“纽约先驱论坛报”的版面的确起了一些变化。
    卖身投靠
    在奥格登·里德的“改革”政策之下，连“纽约先驱论坛报”的十来名所谓老报人也站不住脚了，纷纷去职。其中也有被“纽约时报”挖去的。可是，老牌同人报的销数仍在继续跌落。1955年该报每日销数最高记录为三十八万七千二百七十六份，今年降至三十六万七千二百四十八份。星期刊的销数在1956年年初为五十九万六千三百零八份，今年同期降为五十七万六千四百八十八份。自从1946年以来，“纽约先驱论坛报”的销数下降了18％。
    里德家族是在1872年接办“纽约先驱论坛报”的。从那时起，这个家族就按股份公司的方式改组该报，进一步向资本家卖身投靠。同时打出“严肃”、“独立”的旗号来迷惑公众，取得了所谓“新闻工作者同人报”的称号。
    为了解决“纽约先驱论坛报”江河日下的危局，奥格登·里德除了向资本家摇尾乞怜以外，并无其他妙法。9月中旬，奥格登·里德专程前往伦敦，亲自向美孚油公司大老板、美国驻英大使惠特尼告急，索性把同人报的老招牌也掼掉了。
    自欺欺人
    据美联社报道，“纽约先驱论坛报”社长兼总编辑发表了惠特尼的声明。惠特尼说：“……我作为该报的股东之一，将不负责报纸的经营和社论的政策工作。报纸仍由社长和总编辑领导。”
    惠特尼的说法完全是自欺欺人之谈。“时代周刊”9月23日发表的消息，狠狠地打了惠特尼一个耳光。“时代周刊”透露惠特尼向“纽约先驱论坛报”投资二百万美元，并说：“为了清醒地注视总编辑兼发行人里德领导下的编辑政策，‘纽约先驱论坛报’正在组织一个由商界领袖与共和党领袖为成员的顾问委员会。”
