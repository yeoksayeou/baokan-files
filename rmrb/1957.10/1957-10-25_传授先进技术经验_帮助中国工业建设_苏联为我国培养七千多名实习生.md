Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: From 1953 to the present, the Soviet Union's various industrial sectors have trained over 7,000 interns for China, of whom over 6,000 have completed their studies and returned to China, while another 700+ are continuing their internships in various well-known Soviet factories, mines, and enterprises.

Of these interns, over 80% are complete-set production and management personnel for the 156 key projects the Soviet Union is helping China build. For example, the famous First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, Jilin Thermal Power Plant, Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine, and various newly built factories and mines under the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, have all sent personnel to similar factories in the Soviet Union for internships, from factory directors, chief engineers, technicians, workshop directors, foremen, down to technical workers in key positions. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company alone sent over 700 people to the Soviet Union for internships. Thanks to this new generation of production and management personnel, many key projects, after completion, not only possessed first-class machinery and equipment but were also able to manage production using the most advanced operating techniques.

The scope of these interns' internships in the Soviet Union was very broad, covering more than 100 specialties and hundreds of types of work. These specialties, such as the smelting or processing of various special steels, alloy steels, and certain non-ferrous metals; the manufacture of airplanes, automobiles, and tractors; the manufacture of metallurgical, power generation, and mining equipment; the manufacture of radio and precision instruments; and the manufacture of dyes, plastics, and antibiotics, etc., were all areas where China's original foundation was extremely weak or non-existent, and some were even missing from the curriculum of Chinese universities in the past. Now, thanks to the Soviet Union's assistance in comprehensively training personnel in these areas, it has not only ensured the rapid and smooth commissioning of many newly established industrial sectors during the First Five-Year Plan but has also laid a good foundation for the large-scale domestic training of industrial personnel in the future. According to the plans to train production personnel for units such as the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex and the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant, which will be put into production during the Second Five-Year Plan period, most of the training, except for a few specializations, will be carried out domestically.

Over the past few years, the Soviet government has provided tremendous assistance and care for the work of training interns for China. After arriving in the Soviet Union, interns were always sent to the largest and most technologically advanced factories or mines for internships and were placed in the best workshops or groups in the entire factory. According to many returning interns, their teachers were mostly the best workers or technicians in the factory. Soviet comrades who were responsible for training Chinese interns taught the most advanced technologies to the interns without reservation, even sacrificing a lot of rest time for this purpose. Therefore, although the interns' production knowledge level was not high before going abroad, they mastered production technology proficiently in about a year in the Soviet Union, some in only eight or nine months. After returning to China, under the guidance of Soviet experts, they quickly became the backbone of various work positions and solved many special technical problems that could not be solved domestically. Among them, people like Ma Bin, Deputy General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel; Guo Li, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant; Huang Yiran, Deputy Director of Production and Deputy Chief Engineer; and Zhou Guoquan, Chief Engineer of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, have already become experts in their respective fields.

### 传授先进技术经验　帮助中国工业建设  苏联为我国培养七千多名实习生

    传授先进技术经验　帮助中国工业建设
    苏联为我国培养七千多名实习生
    据新华社讯　从1953年到现在，苏联各工业部门为我国培养了七千多名实习生，其中六千多名已经学成回国，另有七百多名还在苏联各著名工厂矿山企业中继续实习。
    在这批实习生中，有80％以上是苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六项重点工程的成套生产人员和管理人员。例如，著名的第一汽车制造厂、北京电子管厂、吉林热电站、阜新海州露天矿，以及鞍山钢铁公司所属的各个新建厂矿等，差不多从厂长、总工程师、技术员、车间主任、工长直到各个关键工作岗位上的技术工人，全都到苏联同类型工厂去实习过；其中单是鞍山钢铁公司派去苏联实习的就有七百多人。由于有了这批新生的生产人员和管理人员，许多重点工程在建成以后，就不但拥有头等的机器装备，而且同时能运用最先进的操作技术来管理生产。
    这批实习生在苏联的实习范围很广，共有一百多个专业，几百个工种。这些专业中如各种特殊钢、合金钢和某些有色金属的冶炼或加工，飞机、汽车、拖拉机的制造，冶金、发电、采矿设备的制造，无线电、精密仪器的制造，以及染料、塑料、抗生素的制造，等等，都是我国原来基础极为薄弱或是根本没有的，有的甚至在过去我国大学的课程中也是缺门。现在由于苏联帮助我国成套地培养了这些方面的人材，不仅保证了第一个五年计划期间新建立的许多工业部门迅速顺利地投入生产，同时也为今后在国内大量培养工业人材打下了良好基础。根据将在第二个五年计划期间投入生产的武汉钢铁联合企业、富拉尔基重型机器厂等单位培养训练生产人员的计划，除开个别特殊专业以外，绝大部分都将在国内培养。
    几年来，苏联政府对于为我国培养实习生的工作给予了极大的帮助和关怀。实习生到了苏联以后，总是被送到规模最大、技术最先进的工厂或矿山中去实习，同时被安插在全厂最好的车间或小组里。据许多实习生回来说，他们的老师也多半是厂里最优秀的工人或技术人员。担任培养中国实习生的苏联同志，都是毫无保留地把最先进的技术教给实习生。甚至经常为此牺牲了很多休息时间。因此，这些实习生虽然在出国以前生产知识水平并不高，但是他们在苏联一年左右，有的仅八、九个月，就熟练地掌握了生产技术；回国以后，他们在苏联专家的指导下，又很快地成了各种工作岗位上的骨干力量，解决了很多国内无法解决的特殊技术问题。其中像鞍钢副总经理马斌，第一汽车制造厂副厂长兼总工程师郭力、生产副厂长兼副总工程师黄一然，以及北京电子管厂总工程师周国铨等，都已经变成本行业的专家。
