    Talking about the Hong Kong film "The New Widow"
    Wang Yunman
    A widow whose husband has died, suffering discrimination from her mother-in-law... Such things were really common and frequently heard of in the old society and old families; however, the Hong Kong film "The New Widow" can still attract us in terms of content and artistic handling.
    I feel that the film "The New Widow" has some characteristics, so even this artistic work with its relatively narrow and outdated content can show some brilliance.
    The film "The New Widow" pours a lot of sympathy into the character of Fang Mei. This shows the author's attitude towards life. At the same time, this is also naturally revealed through the delicate depiction of the character.
    When a person loses their loved one, it cannot but cause great shock and pain in their heart; moreover, it is Fang Mei, such a weak person who originally placed all her hopes on her husband. After her husband's death, even lying in the hospital, Fang Mei repeatedly urged Liu Shijun to find the perfume her husband had bought for her before his death. Holding the perfume, she said painfully and to herself: "If it weren't for buying this perfume, you wouldn't have died!" This ordinary detail, because it fits the character's mood at this time and place, naturally infects us. We also see that the whole family is busy with the large life insurance payment left by her husband; but Fang Mei is not only not interested, but when she hears her mother-in-law mention it, it arouses her disgust and inner pain. These all subtly depict the true feelings of a weak woman after suffering such a life tragedy, and her kind nature. In addition, when she discovers that her little sister-in-law Wenjuan's boyfriend, Zhang Dawei, is a playboy, she also reminds the naive and ignorant Wenjuan; because the family (including Wenjuan) all distrusts her and dislikes her, on the contrary, they appreciate Zhang Dawei, so, for the first time, she can only mention this to Wenjuan very tactfully. The second time, Fang Mei initially did not want to reveal the truth, but finally, she couldn't bear to watch Wenjuan be fooled by bad guys, so she told her about Zhang Dawei inviting her to the restaurant. We see that Fang Mei, at this time, suppresses her own grief and is busy and concerned for others. This spirit of loving and helping others shows the beautiful aspects of her heart.
    The film "The New Widow" also shows that Fang Mei, this weak woman, is not only incompatible with the feudal family, but also with society. Like her mother-in-law, she is obviously cold to the point of cruelty; people like Manager Zhang are only using Liu Shijun's talent to agree to Fang Mei working in the company. In portraying the character of Zhang Dawei, the film also used such a subtle touch: Fang Mei invited Wenjuan to the restaurant together, so that Wenjuan could personally see Zhang Dawei's shameless and vulgar behavior; his ugliness seemed to be exposed; but immediately afterwards, Zhang Dawei's few sweet words deceived Wenjuan again, making Wenjuan believe that Fang Mei was sabotaging their marriage. This also shows that a kind weak woman, even though the truth is in her hands, is how difficult it is to fight against the dark forces in that society!
    In terms of director's handling, it is also smooth and well-organized. Especially in the splicing of shots, it shows the director's experience and talent.
    For example, in the scene where Fang Mei goes to the place where her husband bought perfume, we begin to see her lonely figure coming from a distance, passing through the streets with people and vehicles, then she hesitates at the entrance of the department store, then she suddenly notices the bloodstains left on the ground after her husband was hit by a car, she runs over blankly, and a close-up of her face reflects her silent grief. In the use of shots, the director gradually moves the camera closer to the character from a distance, and finally presents the character's facial expression to us. This reveals the character's inner state step by step, with layers, from shallow to deep, giving people an increasingly strong emotional infection. The last scene of the film is also very successful in terms of shot splicing. At the beginning of this scene, Fang Mei's return home is like facing a formidable enemy, with many short shots here, the whole family mocks and ridicules her one after another, giving off an atmosphere of "putting her to death," the situation is urgent and tense. When it becomes clear that Fang Mei is pregnant with a posthumous child, the situation immediately changes drastically. In the entire scene, the director almost entirely used close-up shots of Fang Mei, and through this series of close-up shots that can most clearly express the character's inner state, the changes in her emotions of contempt, indignation, and finally the decision to leave to resist the feudal old family are most vividly and prominently revealed. Therefore, when she bravely shouts: "I have the right to protect my child," it is so in line and connected in our feelings. The director's role in this regard should not be ignored.

### 谈香港影片“新寡”

    谈香港影片“新寡”
    王云缦
    一个死去了丈夫的寡妇，受着婆婆的歧视……这类事情，在旧社会旧家庭中，实在是常见常闻的；但是，香港影片“新寡”在内容上、艺术处理上，还是能吸引住我们。
    我感到，影片“新寡”是有一些特点的，因此这个生活内容虽然比较狭窄、陈旧的艺术作品，也能显出一些光彩。
    影片“新寡”对方湄这个人物，是倾注了很大同情的。这点，表现出了作者对生活的态度。同时，这也是通过对于人物的细腻的描写自然地流露出来的。
    当一个人失去自己的亲人时，不能不在心中引起极大的震荡和痛苦；何况，是方湄这样一个软弱、本来就将全部希望寄托在丈夫身上的人。方湄在丈夫死后，虽然躺在医院里，还一再叮嘱刘时俊将她丈夫生前为她买的香水找来。她捧着香水，痛苦地、自言自语地说：“要不是为了买这香水，你也不会死了！”这一平常的细节，因为很切合人物此时此地的心情，就很自然地感染了我们。我们也看到，全家都在为她丈夫遗留下来的一笔偌大的人寿保险费奔忙着；但是方湄不仅毫不感兴趣，当她一听婆婆提到它时，就引起她的厌恶和内心的痛苦。这些，都很细微地描写出了一个弱女子在遭受这种生活悲剧后的真实心情，和她善良的本性。此外，当她发现自己的小姑文娟的男朋友张大维是个洋场恶少时，她也从旁提醒了幼稚无知的文娟；因为家中人（包括文娟）全不信任她、厌恶她，相反很欣赏张大维这个人，所以，第一次，她只能向文娟很婉转地提到这点。第二次，方湄开始并不愿吐露真情，最后，她实在不忍眼看文娟去上坏人的当，才把张大维约她去饭店的事说了出来。我们看到，方湄在此时，压制了自身的悲痛，在为他人奔忙、操心。这种爱人助人的精神，表现了她心灵中美好的方面。
    影片“新寡”也说明方湄这个弱女子，不仅不容于封建家庭，也不容于社会。像她婆婆那样，显然是冷漠到了残酷的程度；像张经理这种人，也不过是利用刘时俊的才干，才同意方湄去公司工作。在表现张大维这个人物时，影片还使了这样一下曲笔：方湄约文娟一起到饭店中去，让文娟亲自看清张大维的无耻下流行为；他的丑态似乎揭穿了；但是紧接着，张大维的三两句花言巧语，又蒙骗了文娟，使文娟相信是方湄在破坏他们的婚事。这也就表现了：一个善良的弱女子，虽然真理在手，在那个社会里和黑暗势力作抗争，是多么不容易啊！
    在导演处理方面，也是流畅、条理分明的。特别是在镜头的组接上，显出了导演的经验和才能。
    例如方湄到她丈夫买过香水的地方去的那段戏，我们开始看到她孤独的身影自远处来，穿过人来车往的街道，然后是她在百货店门口徘徊，接着她突然注意到了她丈夫被车撞死后留在地上的血迹，她木然地奔过去，一个脸部特写，映照出她无言悲痛的神情。导演在镜头的运用上，是渐渐地从远处深处推近人物，最后才将人物的面部表情展现在我们眼前。这就一步步地、有层次地、由浅入深地表露了人物的内心状态，给人情绪上越来越强烈的感染。影片的最后一场，在镜头组接上也很成功。这场戏一开始，方湄回家即如临大敌，这里短镜头多，全家一个接着一个嘲骂她、奚落她，大有“置之于死地”的气氛，情势急促而紧张。等到弄明白方湄怀了遗腹子时，情形立即大变。在整段戏中，导演对于方湄，几乎全部用了特写镜头，通过这一系列最能清晰表现人物内心状态的特写镜头，将她对封建旧家庭的蔑视、愤慨，以至最后决定以出走来抗争的情绪变化，最鲜明最突出地表露了出来。所以，当她勇敢地喊出：“我有权利保护我的孩子”时，在我们的感受上是这么吻合、衔接。导演在这方面的作用，是不应忽视的。
