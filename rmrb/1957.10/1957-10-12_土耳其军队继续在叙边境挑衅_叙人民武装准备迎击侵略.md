　　Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Damascus, the "Victory Newspaper" reported that Turkish troops are continuing to provoke on the Syrian border, firing on Syrian border posts. In another area on the Turkish-Syrian border, near the Syrian village of Buzan, a Turkish patrol crossed the border in an attempt to steal a herd of livestock from the villagers. Residents of this Syrian village put up armed resistance against the raiding Turkish patrol and, with the help of Syrian militia forces, forced the Turkish patrol to withdraw to their own territory. On the same day, in the Jarabulus area near the Euphrates River, Turkish troops fired on Syrian border guards.

　　According to a report from Ankara: Turkish authorities and senior U.S. officials in Turkey held three consecutive meetings in Ankara on October 8th and 9th.

　　According to Agence France-Presse, observers in Ankara believe that these meetings discussed the possibility of the United States increasing aid to Turkey.

　　As news of Turkish border provocations against Syria continues to arrive, people's resistance organizations in northern Syria have obtained weapons, and their members are being trained in the use of weapons in order to be ready to repel any aggression at any time.

　　The Syrian "Al-Nour" newspaper published an editorial on the 9th saying that after the Soviet Union successfully launched an artificial satellite, the U.S. imperialists believe that the danger of a world war may become very distant, thereby threatening the interests of their monopoly groups and their control over other countries, therefore, they continue to try to exacerbate world tensions. The United States' instigation of Turkey to provoke Syria is an example.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：大马士革“胜利报”报道，土耳其军队继续在叙利亚边境进行挑衅，向叙利亚边境岗哨开火。在土叙边境另一个地区的叙利亚布赞村附近，土耳其巡逻队越过边境企图抢走村民的一群家畜。这个叙利亚村庄的居民对进行劫掠的土耳其巡逻队进行了武装抵抗，并且在叙利亚民兵部队的帮助下迫使土耳其巡逻队撤回本土。同一天，在叶弗拉特河附近的查拉布鲁斯地区，土耳其军队曾经向叙利亚边防军开火。
    据安卡拉消息：土耳其当局和美国驻土耳其高级官员10月8日和9日在安卡拉连续举行了三次会谈。
    据法新社报道，安卡拉的观察家们认为，这些会谈讨论了美国增加给土耳其援助的可能性。
    在土耳其对叙利亚进行边境挑衅的消息继续传来的时候，叙利亚北部的人民抵抗组织已经得到了武器，队员们正在受使用武器的训练，以便随时准备好击退任何侵略。
    叙利亚“光明报”9日发表社论说，在苏联发射人造卫星成功后，美帝国主义者认为世界大战的危险可能变得很遥远，从而将威胁他们的垄断集团的利益和他们对其他国家的控制，因此，他们继续设法加剧世界紧张局势。美国指使土耳其对叙利亚挑衅就是一个例子。
