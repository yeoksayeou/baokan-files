Three Beijing Students Set New Maritime Signaling Record

　　This newspaper reports In the 1957 Beijing Water Sports Competition held on the 13th, three young middle school students broke the national record for maritime signaling.

　　The semaphore competition uses the Esperanto phonetic alphabet used in international competitions. Xiang Enhao, a student from the No. 7 Boys' Middle School who won the championship, sent 249 characters in one minute using two semaphore flags and received 165.5 characters, breaking last year's national record of 190 characters sent and 145.5 characters received per minute. The second place winner was Zhou Lingying from the Experimental Middle School (248.5 characters sent, 157.5 characters received), and the third place winner was Zhou Yuanfa from the No. 7 Boys' Middle School (239.5 characters sent, 154.5 characters received).

　　The men's 1,000-meter and women's 500-meter naval six-oared sampan races were exciting and moving. As soon as the starting gun fired, batches of sampans sped across the Houhai lake like arrows. After winning two consecutive championships, the No. 3 Boys' Middle School won first place again with a time of six minutes and 58.2 seconds, winning the "Youth Cup" which can only be retained by winning three consecutive championships. The No. 4 Girls' Middle School won the women's championship with a time of four minutes and 2.2 seconds.

　　The single scull races, like shuttles, and the juvenile sampan races, in which all participants were Young Pioneers, also attracted tens of thousands of spectators and tourists to the lakeside.

　　北京三名学生创海上通讯手旗收发新纪录
    本报讯　在13日举行的1957年北京市水上运动比赛中，三名年轻的中学生打破了海上通讯手旗收发的全国最高纪录。
    手旗比赛是采用国际比赛中使用的世界语拼音文字。获得冠军的男七中学生项恩浩在一分钟内用两面手旗发出了二百四十九字，抄收了一百六十五点五字，这个成绩打破了一分钟发一百九十字，收一百四十五点五字的去年全国最高纪录。第二名是实验中学周玲英（发二百四十八点五字，收一百五十七点五字），第三名男七中周源发（发二百三十九点五字，收一百五十四点五字）。
    男子一千公尺和女子五百公尺的海军六桨舢舨比赛精彩动人。枪声一响，后海湖面上一批又一批的舢舨像箭一样地在湖面上飞驶着。男三中在连获两届冠军以后，又以六分五十八秒二的成绩取得第一名，夺得了只有连获三年冠军才能保持的“青年杯”。女四中以四分二秒二的成绩获得了女子冠军。
    像梭子一般的单人艇比赛和全是红领巾参加的少年舢舨比赛，也吸引了成千上万的观众和湖边的游客。
