Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 2nd. Leading cadres in many departments in Anhui Province are actively improving their leadership style.

Since the start of the rectification campaign, leading cadres of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee have frequently gone deep into rural areas and factories to investigate and research problems. During the summer harvest, more than 50 people, including the director and section chiefs of the Provincial Grain Bureau, went to 17 counties to investigate the unified purchase and sale of grain and oil. Leading cadres such as directors, members, hall and bureau chiefs of the provincial directly-affiliated organs have personally handled more than 1,890 letters from the people and received more than 340 visits from the people.

Leadership styles in various special districts and counties have also improved. In the Fuyang Special District, cadres above the county level each have contact with an agricultural cooperative and go there once a week to solve problems while working, which is very popular among farmers. In the Liu'an Special District, each responsible cadre in the financial and trade system is required to work in grassroots units for at least half a month each quarter to strengthen investigation and research. In Anqing City, it has become a system for cadres above the section and bureau chief level to participate in physical labor. In June, they carried soil on the dikes, in July they delivered manure to the countryside, and in August they helped to eliminate locusts, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the peasants. In Ma'anshan City, cadres from the municipal party committee secretary to those above the section level insist on two to four hours of physical labor every week, and many cadres have formed close friendships with workers during the labor.

    安徽各部门改进领导作风
    走出办公室深入农村工厂
    新华社合肥2日电  安徽省很多部门领导干部积极改进领导作风。
    中共安徽省委和省人民委员会的领导干部，在整风开始以来经常深入农村工厂，调查研究问题。夏收时，省粮食厅厅长、处长等五十多人曾到十七个县调查粮食和油料统购统销情况。省直属机关各部、委、厅、局长等领导干部已抽出时间亲自处理人民来信一千八百九十多件，接待人民来访三百四十多次。
    各专区、县的领导作风也有了改进。在阜阳专区，县以上的干部每人都联系一个农业社，每周去一次，边生产边解决问题，很受农民欢迎。六安专区财贸系统的每个负责干部，每季规定至少有半个月在基层单位工作，以加强调查研究工作。安庆市全市科局长以上干部参加体力劳动已形成制度。他们6月份上堤挑土，7月份送粪下乡，8月份帮助灭蝗，大大鼓舞了农民的生产情绪。马鞍山市从市委书记到科以上的干部，每周都坚持二到四小时的体力劳动，很多干部在劳动中与工人结成了知心朋友。
