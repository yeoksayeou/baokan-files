Newly Discovered Documents on Sino-Soviet Relations

　　According to the Soviet journal "Historical Issues" No. 3, 1957, a batch of documents concerning Sino-Soviet relations has been discovered in the Novosibirsk Provincial State Archives of the Soviet Union. These include the negotiation agreement between the representative of the Siberian Revolutionary Military Committee of Soviet Russia and the Xinjiang authorities of China in September 1921 on jointly eliminating the White bandits, and other documents.

　　In 1920, General Bakich, a White bandit under Kolchak, gathered the remnants of the Orenburg Cossack regiment, forming a force of about two hundred men. After being pursued by the Soviet Russian Red Army, they fled into western Mongolia and joined forces with the White bandits Kaigorodov and Kazantsev to carry out harassment activities. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, with the assistance of the Red Army, dealt a heavy blow to the White bandits. Bakich then sneaked into Tacheng and Chenghua in Xinjiang, continuing to endanger the people of China and the Soviet Union. In order to completely eliminate this common enemy, in August 1921, the Xinjiang authorities of China and the representative of the Siberian Revolutionary Military Committee held negotiations in Tacheng, and the representatives of the two countries signed an agreement. The agreement stipulated the methods of coordinated action between the two sides. As a result of the coordinated operations between the Chinese and Soviet armies according to the agreement, all the White bandits who had sneaked into Xinjiang were quickly annihilated. After the military operations, the Soviet government also conducted negotiations with the Xinjiang authorities on commercial agreements, the establishment of friendly relations, and the establishment of a Soviet Russian consulate in Tacheng.

　　There is no doubt that the discovery of these documents is of great significance for studying Sino-Soviet relations, especially the friendly relations between Xinjiang, China, and the Soviet Union.

　　新发现的一批有关中苏关系的文件
    据苏联“历史问题”1957年第三期报道，在苏联新西伯利亚省国家档案库里，发现了一批有关中苏关系的文件。这是1921年9月苏俄新西伯利亚革命军事委员会代表和我国新疆当局关于共同协力消灭白匪的谈判协定及其他一些文件。
    1920年，白匪高尔察克的将军巴克奇纠合鄂伦堡哥萨克军团残部组成一支约二百人的队伍，在受到苏俄红军的追击后，逃入蒙古西部，又联合白匪开果洛多夫和卡桑采支的队伍进行骚扰活动。蒙古人民革命军在红军的协助下给白匪以沉重打击。巴克奇遂窜入新疆塔城、承化一带，继续危害中苏两国人民。为了彻底消灭这一共同的敌人，1921年8月我国新疆当局和西伯利亚革命军事委员会代表在塔城举行了谈判，两国代表并签订了协定。协定规定了双方配合行动的办法，由于中苏两国军队根据协定配合作战，终于很快歼灭了窜入新疆的全部白匪。军事行动结束后，苏维埃政府又和新疆当局进行了关于商务协定、关于建立友好关系和在塔城设置苏俄领事馆等谈判。
    毫无疑问，这些文件的发现，对研究中苏关系，特别是我国新疆与苏联的友好关系有重要意义。
