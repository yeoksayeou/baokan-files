    Call for a Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference
    Recent advances in science and technology have opened a new era for humanity. Mankind must now decide whether these advances will serve life or death.
    Public opinion and a very large number of authorities have expressed, with unprecedented force, their support for disarmament and international cooperation. But people are still very worried. This is not only because no agreement has yet been reached on stopping nuclear explosions and starting disarmament, but also because the tensions between military blocs have become increasingly acute. The peoples of all countries are increasingly suffering from the ever-increasing military expenditures, and the real danger of atomic war has arisen in the world.
    The World Peace Council has consistently stated that in order to avoid the danger of war, it is necessary to abolish military blocs, destroy atomic weapons, and achieve complete disarmament under strict supervision. It has declared that peace cannot be established and maintained without international cooperation based on the principle of equal rights for all countries, large and small, and full respect for their territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independent rights.
    Many organizations, moral and religious forces, many scientists, writers, and artists have recently expressed the same view, that the free exchange of ideas can enable us to jointly find ways to achieve these goals.
    In order to give wider expression to the voice of public opinion and to prompt governments to make decisions, the World Peace Council will convene a conference on disarmament and international cooperation in the middle of 1958.

    关于召开裁军和国际合作大会的号召
    最近科学和技术所取得的进步为人类开辟了一个新纪元。这些进步将为生活还是为死亡服务，人类现在必须加以抉择。
    舆论以及非常众多的权威人士已经以前所未见的力量表示赞成裁军和国际合作。但是人们仍然很担心。这不仅是由于在停止原子核爆炸和开始裁军方面仍然没有达成协议，而且也由于军事集团间的紧张局势已经愈来愈尖锐化。各国人民正愈来愈多地受到不断增长的军备开支的害处，世界上已经产生了原子战争的真实危险。
    世界和平理事会始终宣称，为了避免战争的危险，有必要取消军事集团，销毁原子武器和在严格监督下实现全面裁军。它已经宣布，如果没有根据所有大小国家权利平等、充分尊重它们的领土完整、主权和独立权利的原则的国际合作，是无法建立和维持和平的。
    有很多组织，道义和宗教势力，很多科学家，作家和艺术家最近表示了同样的意见，就是自由交流各种思想可以使我们共同找到达到这些目的的道路。
    为了使舆论的呼声得到更广泛的表达和促使各国政府作出决定，世界和平理事会将在1958年年中召开一次裁军和国际合作大会。
