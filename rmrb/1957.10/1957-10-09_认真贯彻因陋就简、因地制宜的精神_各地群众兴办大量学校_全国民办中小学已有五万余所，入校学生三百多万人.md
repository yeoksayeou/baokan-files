    Conscientiously Implement the Spirit of Making Do With What You Have and Adapting to Local Conditions
    Masses in Various Regions Establish a Large Number of Schools
    There are Already More Than 50,000 People-Run Primary and Secondary Schools Nationwide, with More Than 3 Million Students Enrolled

    (Report from this newspaper) According to the "Teacher's News," currently, there are already more than 50,000 primary and secondary schools run by the masses nationwide (not including schools run by industrial and mining enterprises and private schools), with more than 3,380,000 students enrolled.

    The enthusiasm of the masses for running schools is very high in many provinces and cities. In Hunan, after the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the number of students in people-run schools increased more than ninefold compared to the first half of the year. In Hubei, during the 1955-1956 academic year, there were only 1,672 people-run schools with 117,655 students; this year, it has increased to 6,640 schools with 350,088 students. In Gansu Province, the number of students enrolled in people-run schools has also increased by more than 200,000 in the past year.

    When running schools on their own, the masses implemented the spirit of making do with what they have, being diligent, and practicing thrift. School buildings are used as much as possible from old houses, ancestral halls, and temples. Most of the teaching aids in the schools are self-made from waste materials. If there are not enough desks and chairs, students bring their own. Some schools even use earthen platforms instead of desks and chairs, and wooden boards as lecterns, promoting the spirit of hard work in running schools.

    People-run schools in various regions generally achieve adapting to local conditions and being flexible and diverse. Based on the specific conditions of the region, season, school buildings, teaching aids, teachers, and funding, the types of schools include regular middle schools, primary schools, half-day and every-other-day primary schools, middle schools, cultural supplementary schools, spare-time study classes, and vocational training classes. In order to facilitate students' participation in labor production during the day, some rural schools have changed class times to early morning and evening. People-run schools also attach great importance to labor education, and many schools have agricultural technology courses. Some schools have also opened experimental gardens to create conditions for students to participate in agricultural production.

    The sources of funding for people-run schools are roughly as follows: first, agricultural cooperatives and students' parents jointly bear the teachers' salaries, benefits, and office expenses, or the agricultural cooperatives subsidize the insufficient funds of people-run schools; second, whoever studies pays, and all expenses are borne by the students; third, the agricultural cooperative runs the school, and all expenses are borne by the cooperative (borne by all members or public welfare funds); fourth, the district and township governments and people from industrial and commercial circles raise a portion of the funds to subsidize people-run schools.

    Due to the government's vigorous advocacy, concern, and assistance, people-run schools have sprung up like mushrooms after a spring rain since the beginning of the new semester.

    认真贯彻因陋就简、因地制宜的精神
    各地群众兴办大量学校
    全国民办中小学已有五万余所，入校学生三百多万人
    本报讯　据教师报消息：目前，全国群众兴办的小学、中学（不包括工矿企业办的学校和私立学校）已有五万余所，入校学生达三百三十八万多人。
    很多省、市群众办学的积极性十分高涨。湖南在农业合作化高潮以后，民办学校的学生比上半年增加了九倍多。湖北在1955—1956学年度，只有民办学校一千六百七十二所，学生十一万七千六百五十五名；今年就增至学校六千六百四十所，学生三十五万零八十八名。甘肃省一年来民办学校招收的学生数也增加了二十万以上。
    群众在自办学校时，贯彻了因陋就简、克勤克俭的精神。校舍尽可能利用旧民房、祠堂、庙宇，学校里的教具，大部分都是用废料自制；桌椅不足，就由学生自带。有的学校还用土台代替桌椅，用木板当做讲桌，发扬了艰苦办学的精神。
    各地民办学校一般都做到了因地制宜和灵活多样，根据地区、季节、校舍、教具、师资、经费等具体条件，在学校类型上有正规中学、小学、半日制和隔日制的小学、中学、文化补习学校，业余学习班，专业训练班等方式。有的农村学校为便于学生白天参加劳动生产，上课时间改在清早和晚上。民办学校对劳动教育也很重视，不少学校设有农业技术课。有的学校并开辟了实验园地，为学生创造参加农业生产的条件。
    民办学校经费来源，大体有这样几种：一是由农业社和学生家长共同负担教师的工资、福利和办公费用，或由农业社补助民办学校经费的不足；二是谁读书、谁出钱，全部经费由学生负担；三是农业社办，费用全部由社负担（全体社员或公益金负担）；四是由区乡政府和工商界人士筹募经费的一部分来贴补民办学校。
    由于政府的大力提倡、关怀和帮助，新学期开始后，民办学校像雨后春笋般涌现出来。
