    Fake Medicines and Narcotics
    Drug Dealers' Tricks
    American magazines and newspapers frequently publish advertisements for various fake medicines. In recent years, American drug dealers, in order to seize profits, have even exploited the fear of obesity among wealthy capitalists, manufacturing all kinds of slimming drugs: slimming pills, slimming chewing gum, slimming tablets... The names are numerous and endless.

    In August of this year, a report published by a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives exposed the true nature of the slimming drugs promoted by American drug dealers.

    According to the above report, the U.S. government has conducted tests on some popular slimming drugs. The results showed that the so-called slimming drugs are actually deceptive fakes, which not only do not have the effect of slimming and reducing fat, but are also harmful to the human body. Some slimming pills are simply ordinary candies, but with attractive medicinal names and vigorous promotion, they become famous drugs. Still others are disguised as ordinary vitamin pills or soda tablets.

    The popular American slimming wonder drug "R·D·X·" is well-known. This is a very palatable tablet. According to the investigation report, "R·D·X·" is actually made from defatted milk and lemon juice, and has no medicinal effect whatsoever except for stimulating the appetite and strengthening the spleen. However, American drug dealers advertise it by boasting: "Eat R·D·X· and you can rest assured to eat whatever you like without worrying about gaining weight." In fact, people who take this tablet not only remain overweight, but they also develop a habit of eating one or two bottles of "R·D·X·" every day.

    Some slimming drugs can cause intestinal contractions, vomiting, and other phenomena, which are extremely harmful to the human body. However, the drug dealers' advertisements say that swallowing these tablets before meals can make people feel full, so they can eat less.

    Some slimming pills are extremely harmful to people with diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Drug dealers dare not completely hide this. Therefore, they print a few lines in the least conspicuous place on the packaging box in the smallest font: "People with diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure should not take this product. If you want to use it, you must follow your doctor's advice." However, because the font is too small, it is often not easy to notice.

    In addition to all kinds of slimming pills, the United States has recently seen a fantastic new business - slimming massage parlors. It is said that any fat person who stays in a slimming massage parlor for a period of time can become thin through massage. This report from the U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee also revealed the secret of the so-called "massage slimming parlor." It turns out that fat people who enter the massage parlor are subject to strict dietary control and are not allowed to overeat. After a few days, their weight will naturally decrease. The so-called massage is just a guise. (Le Shan)

    Drug Addiction Ranks First
    An article in the American "Nation" magazine recently said that the United States is the country with the widest spread of narcotic addiction in the world. Illegal drug trafficking in the past year alone was estimated to be worth $400 million.

    Since World War II, illegal drug trafficking in the United States has tripled. It is estimated that 50% of crimes in major U.S. cities are caused by drug addiction, and 25% nationwide.

    The result of illegal drug use (including crime, punishment, hospitalization) costs nearly $2 billion a year.

    Drug use is most prevalent among medical professionals in the United States, surpassing any other industry. The entertainment industry (especially jazz musicians) ranks first in drug use.

### 假药和麻醉品

    假药和麻醉品
    药商的花招
    美国杂志报刊经常刊登形形色色的贩卖假药的广告。近年以来，美国药商为了攫取利润，竟不惜利用脑满肥肠的资本家害怕肥胖的心理，制造了各种各类的瘦身药：瘦身丸、瘦身口香糖、瘦身片……名目繁多，不胜枚举。
    今年8月，美国国会众议院一个小组委员会所发表的调查报告，暴露了美国药商推销的瘦身药究竟是什么货色。
    根据上述的报告，美国政府已经对某些畅销的瘦身药进行了试验。结果发现所谓瘦身药竟是骗人的假药，不但没有消肥减胖的功效，反而有害于人体。也有一些瘦身丸根本就是普通的糖果，不过取了好听的药名，经过大力的吹嘘、推销就成了名药。还有一些竟是用普通的维他命丸或苏打片来冒充的。
    美国畅销的瘦身妙药“R·D·X·”脍灸人口。这是一种十分可口的药片。根据调查报告，“R·D·X·”竟是用去脂的牛奶与柠檬汁制成的，除了开胃健脾以外，丝毫没有医疗的功效。可是美国药商的广告却吹嘘说：“吃了R·D·X·你就可以放心大胆尽量吃你欢喜吃的东西，不必担心发胖。”事实上，服用这种药片的人不但仍旧大腹便便，他们还染上了一个嗜好，每天非要吃一两瓶“R·D·X·”不可。
    有些瘦身药会引起大肠收缩、呕吐等现象，极端有害于人体。但是药商的广告却说，饭前吞食这些药片可以使人感到十分饱足，可以少吃一些东西。
    有些瘦身丸对患糖尿病、心脏病、高血压的人危害性极大。药商不敢完全隐瞒。于是，他们就在包装的纸盒上最不显著的地方，用最小的字体印上几行字：“凡患糖尿病、心脏病或高血压者，不宜服食本品。如欲采用须遵医嘱。”但是由于字体太小，往往不容易发现。
    除了五花八门的瘦身丸以外，美国最近还出现了一种异想天开的新兴事业——瘦身按摩院。据说，凡是胖子在瘦身按摩院住过一个时期，经过按摩就可以变瘦。美国众议院小组委员会的这个报告，也揭露了所谓“按摩瘦身院”的秘密。原来，进了按摩院的胖子，一律受到严格的饮食管制，不准贪吃。不多几日体重自然减轻。所谓按摩不过是一个幌子。（乐山）
    吸毒称第一
    美国“民族”周刊在最近登载的一篇文章中说：美国是世界上麻醉品嗜好流传最广的国家。非法贩卖麻醉品在去年一年内据估计就值四亿美元。
    第二次大战以来，非法贩毒在美国增加到三倍。在美国各大城市里估计有50％的犯罪是由吸毒引起的，就全国范围来说有25％。
    由于非法使用麻醉品的结果（包括犯罪，惩罚，住医院），一年要耗费将近二十亿美元。
    美国医务界从业人员的吸毒是最流行的，超过任何其他行业。文娱界（其中尤其是爵士音乐师）在吸毒上居第一位。
