Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch, TASS: As of 6:00 AM Moscow time on October 27th, the Soviet artificial satellite had orbited the Earth 333 times, covering a distance of over 14,452,000 kilometers.

    After the power of the satellite's transmitter was depleted, it stopped working. Under the current circumstances, optical observation is of great significance, as this observation will be the main tool for measuring the orbit of the artificial satellite and its carrier rocket, as well as for further predicting their operation.

    Currently, the time it takes for the artificial satellite to orbit the Earth once is 95.31 minutes, and for the carrier rocket, it is 94.68 minutes.

    By the evening of October 27th, the carrier rocket will be 4,800 kilometers away from the artificial satellite, and it will appear 10.5 minutes later than the artificial satellite.

    人造卫星继续运行
    电力用完停发讯号
    据新华社27日讯  塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联人造卫星到10月27日莫斯科时间六时为止，已经绕行地球三百三十三圈，经过路程在一千四百四十五万二千公里以上。
    人造卫星的发报机的电力用完后，已经停止工作。在目前的情况下，光学观察具有重大的意义，这种观察将是测量人造卫星和运载火箭轨道以及进一步预测它们的运行的主要工具。
    目前，人造卫星绕行地球一圈的时间为九十五点三一分钟，运载火箭为九十四点六八分钟。
    运载火箭到10月27日晚间，将距离人造卫星四千八百公里，它将比人造卫星迟十点五分钟出现。
