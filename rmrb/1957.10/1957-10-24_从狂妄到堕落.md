From Arrogance to Degeneracy
    Liu Feng
    According to reports, the young author Liu Shaotang not only engaged in small-group activities with several young rightists in literary and art circles in Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhejiang, but he also drafted a rural "transformation" plan, preparing to establish an experimental zone in the countryside to resist the Party's cooperation movement. Liu Shaotang also planned to return to his hometown, win over a group of people to run a mimeographed small newspaper, and establish a school to promote his ideas and cultivate his own henchmen, in order to develop into a group, so that one day he could realize his ideals nationwide.
    Today, it is nothing new to talk about establishing a so-called rural experimental zone in the countryside. We know that the imperialist agent Y.C. James Yen established the "Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement" and conducted a so-called "rural experiment" in Ding County, Hebei. Liang Shuming also conducted experiments in Zou County, Shandong, to reform the countryside. Liang Shuming once believed that "If you want to eliminate the Communist movement, you must have another peasant movement to replace it." These bourgeois reformist tricks of "rural construction" and "rural experiments" were completely plots to oppress and exploit the peasants, causing the destruction of the countryside, and were long seen through by the local peasants. Their main aim was to oppose the Communist Party's most thorough land reform policy, but their dreams were shattered by reality!
    I remember that in early 1948, before the national liberation, Y.C. James Yen even wrote to Truman, asking the American imperialists for 180 million US dollars to run "mass education" and conduct rural reform experiments, declaring that "taking three years as a period, to win over the peasants, to isolate the CCP forces," and save the Kuomintang from extinction. Such a method was shouted for a while, but was not adopted by the foreign father.
    Liu Shaotang, as a Communist Party member, did not take the socialist road to achieve the communist goal, but degenerated into the bourgeois reformist mire of Y.C. James Yen and Liang Shuming. It can be said that Liu Shaotang completely lost confidence in taking the socialist road. He believed that the cooperativization was messed up, the unified purchase and sales were messed up, and the countryside was very chaotic and bad, and needed someone like him, Liu Shaotang, to transform it. Precisely because of this, he wanted to establish a "rural experimental zone" to resist the Party's agricultural cooperativization movement, in order to abolish the Party's agricultural cooperativization movement!
    Liu Shaotang's idea, in addition to being related to his origin in the exploiting class and not undergoing socialist ideological transformation, is also related to his ignorance and arrogance. Agricultural cooperativization is the best way to develop rural productive forces, make the national economy planned, and free peasants from exploitation and poverty, after long-term exploration. And the reformist methods can only make a few people rich and prosperous, while making the majority of peasants return to the miserable days of being exploited and squeezed, subjected to usury, selling unripe crops, and crying hungry and cold all year round.
    Obviously, it is difficult for Liu Shaotang to carry out his rural "experiment." The broad masses of peasants have fully understood the superiority of agricultural cooperativization and will never be sacrificed as Liu Shaotang's experimental subjects. Here, the peasants who have been through thick and thin, who were once penniless, and who have gone through the land reform struggle and the upsurge of cooperativization, do indeed have more knowledge than people like Liu Shaotang. Intellectuals like Liu Shaotang must honestly take workers and peasants as teachers. Because they have personally experienced that the bourgeois set of agricultural reform plans is unworkable. That stinking pose of wanting to be the savior of the peasants must also be thrown away as soon as possible.
    From this, it is not difficult to know that Liu Shaotang's degeneration into an anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist is more or less related to his ignorance and arrogance. He does not know that Y.C. James Yen and Liang Shuming had long had the dream of "transforming the countryside." Therefore, studying the history of the Party's struggle against all kinds of reactionary ideological trends since its establishment is very important for the younger generation. This can increase some immunity.

    从狂妄到堕落
    刘丰
    据报上揭露，青年作者刘绍棠不仅同北京、天津、浙江文艺界的几个青年右派分子搞小集团活动，他还拟了一个农村“改造”计划，准备在乡村搞一个实验区，同党的合作化运动相抗衡。刘绍棠并打算回到他的故乡，拉拢一批人来办一个油印小报，创办一所学校，宣传他的主张培养自己的喽啰，以便发展成一个集团，以便有朝一日，在全国实现他的理想。
    在今天说来，在乡村搞所谓农村实验区，已完全不是什么新的玩艺。我们知道帝国主义走卒晏阳初就搞过“中华平民教育促进会”，并在河北定县进行所谓“农村实验”。梁漱溟也在山东邹平搞实验县进行农村的改革。梁漱溟曾认为：“要想消除共产党的运动，必须另有一种农民运动起来替代才可以。”这些资产阶级改良主义的“乡村建设”、“农村实验”花招完全是压迫农民，剥削农民使农村毁灭的阴谋，早被当地的农民看穿了。他们主要的是反对共产党的最彻底的土地改革政策，然而他们的梦想早被现实粉碎了！
    记得在1948年初全国解放前夕，晏阳初还上书杜鲁门请美帝国主义给他一万万八千万元美金来办“平民教育”，进行乡村改革的实验，并宣称“以三年为期，来争取农民，以孤立中共势”，而挽救国民党的灭亡。这样的办法空喊了一阵，也未被洋爸爸采纳。
    刘绍棠身为一个共产党员，竟不走社会主义的道路，达共产主义目标，竟然堕落到晏阳初、梁漱溟之流的资产阶级改良主义的泥坑。可以说，在刘绍棠是完全丧失了走社会主义道路的信心，在他认为合作化搞糟了，统购统销搞糟了，农村乱得很、糟得很，须要他刘绍棠这样的人来改造一下。正因为如此，所以他要搞一个“乡村实验区”，和党的农业合作化运动相抗衡，以取消党的农业合作化运动！
    刘绍棠的这个想法，除了跟他出身于剥削阶级和没有经过社会主义思想改造有关系外，也是和他的无知和狂妄有关系的。农业合作化是经过长期摸索出来的发展农村生产力，使国家经济计划化，使农民摆脱剥削和贫困的最好的办法。而改良主义的办法都只能使少数人发财致富，而使大多数农民回到被剥削被榨取，受高利贷盘剥，卖青苗，终年啼饥号寒的苦难日子里去。
    显然，刘绍棠是很难进行他的乡村“实验”的，广大的农民群众已充分了解到农业合作化的优越性，绝不会供刘绍棠做试验的牺牲品了。在这里饱经风霜，曾经是贫无立锥之地的农民，经过土地改革斗争和合作化高潮的农民，的确是比刘绍棠之流有更多的知识。刘绍棠之类的知识分子必须老老实实拜工人农民为老师。因为他们亲身体会到资产阶级的一套农业改革计划是行不通的。那种想做农民救世主的臭架子也必须早些扔掉。
    从这里也不难知道，刘绍棠堕落成为一个反党反社会主义的右派分子，是多多少少和他的无知和狂妄有关的，他不知道晏阳初、梁漱溟之流早就有过“改造农村”的梦想了。因之，学习党成立以来同各色各样反动的思想流派斗争的历史，对于年轻一代来说是很重要的。这可以增加一些免疫性。
