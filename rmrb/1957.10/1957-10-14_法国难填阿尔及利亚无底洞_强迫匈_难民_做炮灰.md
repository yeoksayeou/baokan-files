Xinhua News Agency, New York, 13th Dispatch: The Algerian National Liberation Front delegation stationed in New York issued a statement to the press on the 11th, exposing France's coercion of Hungarian "refugees" to participate in the Algerian War.

The statement specifically cited the experience of Hungarian "refugee" Sandor Joffe-Z as proof. Joffe-Z, 19 years old, fled from Hungary to Austria in November 1956 under the influence of hostile propaganda. There, he was placed in the Landegg refugee camp run by the United States. Later, he and 160 other "refugees" were transferred to the Colmar concentration camp in France. There, France began to intensify its recruitment of them into the Foreign Legion. Those who refused to enlist were sent to various coal mining areas. Joffe-Z was sent to Lievin, near the Belgian border. In the coal mines of this area, the most difficult work was done by foreigners, without any safety equipment.

Recruiters from the Foreign Legion seized the opportunity of the widespread panic among the "refugees" caused by the accidents and deaths in the coal mines and appeared again. This time, the name of the Foreign Legion was not mentioned at all. They used all sorts of promises to persuade the workers to "serve" in France's overseas territories. More than half of the Hungarians working in the coal mines agreed.

After the "refugees" arrived in Marseille, they were placed in the barracks of the Foreign Legion, at which point they realized they had been deceived. They resolutely protested to the authorities, demanding to be released.

The military police came forward and the refugees were thrown into prison as "communists." In prison, they were given a choice: either agree to join the Foreign Legion, or continue to be imprisoned. Thirty Hungarians were thus recruited into the Foreign Legion. After arriving in Algeria, many Hungarians were confined for refusing to carry out their tasks.

Joffe-Z finally revolted and defected to the Algerian National Liberation Army.

### 法国难填阿尔及利亚无底洞  强迫匈“难民”做炮灰

    法国难填阿尔及利亚无底洞
    强迫匈“难民”做炮灰
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线驻纽约代表团11日向新闻界发表声明，揭露法国强迫匈牙利“难民”参加阿尔及利亚战争。
    声明特别举出匈牙利“难民”山多尔·约菲?茨的遭遇作为证明。十九岁的约菲?茨是1956年11月在敌对宣传的影响下由匈牙利逃到奥地利的。在那里他被安置在美国主持的兰戴夫难民集中营里。后来，他和其他一百六十名“难民”一道被转到法国科尔马集中营。在那里，法国开始加紧招募他们参加外籍军团。拒绝入伍的人被分头送到各个煤区。约菲?茨被送到靠近比利时边境的列弗尔。在这一地区的煤井里，最困难的工作都由外国人做，同时没有任何安全设备。
    外籍军团的招募人趁着煤井中的伤亡事故在“难民”中引起普遍惊慌的机会，又在这里露面了。这次根本没有提到外籍军团的名字。他们用种种诺言游说工人到法国在海外的属地去“服务”。在煤井工作的半数以上匈牙利人同意了。
    “难民”来到马赛以后就被安置在外籍军团的兵营里，这时他们才知道受骗了。他们坚决向当局抗议，要求放他们出去。
    军事警察出面了，难民被当做“共产党人”投入监狱。在监狱里要他们抉择：是同意参加外籍军团，还是继续坐牢。三十名匈牙利人就这样被招募入外籍军团。到了阿尔及利亚之后，许多匈牙利人由于拒绝执行任务而被禁闭。
    约菲?茨最后起义投到了阿尔及利亚民族解放军这一边。
