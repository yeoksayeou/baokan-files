Xinhua News Agency, October 16th: The Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a three-day symposium from the 11th to the 14th to criticize the anti-communist and anti-socialist activities of right-wing elements in the historical field, Xiang Da, Lei Haizong, Rong Mengyuan, and Chen Mengjia, and to defend the Marxist-Leninist line in historical science. Nearly 300 historians from Beijing and Tianjin participated in the symposium.

According to revelations at the meeting, Xiang Da, deputy director of the Second Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and professor of the History Department of Peking University, engaged in a series of anti-communist and anti-socialist activities. Starting last year, he colluded with right-wing elements such as Pan Guangdan and Peng Bo, a right-wing element of the Tujia nationality in Western Hunan, using the issue of establishing a joint autonomous prefecture for the Miao and Tujia nationalities in Western Hunan, to undermine national unity and carry out anti-communist conspiracies. They attempted to alienate the 700,000 Miao people from the Tujia people, disregarding the wishes of the broad masses of the Tujia people, and resolutely opposed the joint autonomy of the Miao and Tujia nationalities. Xiang Da orchestrated and made decisions in this political conspiracy, instructing the right-wing elements among the Tujia people on how to fight against the Party and government leaders. Xiang Da told them to have confidence and determination to oppose the local Party and government's plan for joint Miao-Tujia autonomy, saying that "separate autonomy is the best policy," and wrote to Peng Bo saying, "Everywhere, you must consider how to allow the other party to step down, and do not force the other party to fight back desperately." The "other party" Xiang Da mentioned here refers to the Party and government leaders. Xiang Da also informed the Tujia right-wing element Peng Bo et al. of the opinions of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission that he had deliberately distorted, instigating them to stir up trouble everywhere and provoke the relationship between the central and local authorities. Xiang Da's purpose in resolutely opposing the joint autonomy of the Miao and Tujia nationalities in Western Hunan, according to his own admission, was to become the "elder" of the Tujia nationality (Xiang Da is from Western Hunan, and Pan Guangdan identified his ethnicity as Tujia). Peng Bo wrote to Xiang Da clearly expressing his support for Xiang Da as the leader of the Tujia nationality. Xiang Da, Peng Bo, and others also plotted to expand their influence and establish autonomous regions spanning several provinces.

Xiang Da also falsely accused the Party leadership of the Academy of Sciences of being "laymen leading experts," "like Zhang Zongchang leading troops," and that among the forty or fifty communists he had come into contact with, all but two had been subjected to his malicious attacks. Xiang Da conspired to provoke the relationship between the Communist Party and intellectuals. He viciously said: "The Party has the idea of 'those who are not of my race must have different intentions' towards non-Party members, and the Party regards scientists as 'street wanderers,' 'summoned when needed, dismissed when not.'" Xiang Da deeply hated the socialist system and Marxism-Leninism. He falsely accused some of the country's economic policies of being "close to draining the pond to get all the fish" or "drinking poison to quench thirst"; falsely accused the Communist Party's call for cadres to participate in physical labor as "formalism," and so on.

At the meeting, many people emphasized the necessity of ideological remolding for intellectuals when criticizing Xiang Da. Chen Yuan, a 78-year-old professor, president of Beijing Normal University, and director of the Second Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the fundamental reason for Xiang Da's anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds was the issue of class stand. Weng Dujian, director of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau and part-time researcher at the Second Institute of History, pointed out that the reason why old intellectuals became right-wing elements was that they resisted ideological remolding after liberation. Tang Yongtong, vice president of Peking University, said in his written statement that he learned a lesson from the criticism of Xiang Da, that is, knowledge must serve the people, and intellectuals must integrate with the workers and peasants. Wu Han, vice mayor of Beijing and academic committee member of the Second Institute of History, exposed Xiang Da's consistent anti-communist and anti-people words and deeds in history, and exposed Xiang Da's false mask of "democratic fighter."

Zheng Tianting, director of the History Department of Nankai University in Tianjin, reported on the situation of the Tianjin historical community's counterattack against the right-wing element Lei Haizong. At this symposium, philosopher Sun Dingguo, Professor Wu Tingqiu of the History Department of Nankai University, and others further criticized Lei Haizong's numerous malicious words and deeds, pointing out that Lei Haizong opposed Marxism-Leninism in the name of anti-dogmatism, attempting to pave the way for bourgeois social science and capitalist restoration.

The symposium also severely criticized Rong Mengyuan, a researcher at the Third Institute of History and a right-wing element, and Chen Mengjia, a researcher at the Institute of Archaeology and a right-wing element.

Yang Renpian, a professor of the History Department of Peking University, was also criticized at the meeting for his right-wing thoughts and words.

Right-wing elements Xiang Da, Rong Mengyuan, and Chen Mengjia all made self-criticisms at the meeting. Right-wing element Lei Haizong was in Tianjin and did not attend the symposium.

At the end of the symposium, Fan Wenlan, director of the Third Institute of History, once again explained the difference between ideological issues and political issues. He pointed out that the anti-rightist struggle will never affect the development of the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending, and that the garden for the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending will become wider and freer in the future. Finally, Jian Bozan, a standing committee member of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences and professor of the History Department of Peking University, made a concluding speech.

　　中国科学院哲学社会科学部举行座谈会
    揭穿向达破坏民族团结的政治阴谋
    据新华社16日讯  中国科学院哲学社会科学部在11日到14日举行了三天座谈会，批判史学界右派分子向达、雷海宗、荣孟源和陈梦家的反共反社会主义活动，捍卫历史科学中的马克思列宁主义路线。参加座谈会的有北京、天津的史学工作者近三百人。
    据会上揭露，中国科学院历史研究所第二所副所长、北京大学历史系教授向达进行了一系列的反共反社会主义的活动。从去年起，他就利用湘西建立苗族和土家族联合自治州问题，与右派分子潘光旦、湘西土家族右派分子彭泊等勾结，破坏民族团结，进行反共阴谋活动，他们企图离间七十万苗族与土家族的关系，不顾土家族广大群众的愿望，坚决反对苗族与土家族联合自治。向达在这个政治阴谋活动中运筹决策，指点土家族中的右派分子如何向党政领导作斗争，向达要他们有信心有决心反对地方党政苗土联合自治的方案，说“单独自治为上策”，并写信给彭泊说：“处处要考虑到如何使对方能够下台，而不要逼着对方负隅反噬。”向达在这里说的“对方”，就是党政领导。向达还把他故意歪曲了的中央民委的意见通知土家族右派分子彭泊等，唆使他们四处点火，挑拨中央与地方的关系。向达坚决反对湘西苗、土两族联合自治的目的，据他承认是想做土家族的“长老”（向达是湘西人，潘光旦鉴定他的民族成分是土家族）。彭泊写给向达的信中曾明白表示要拥护向达作土家族领袖。向达和彭泊等还图谋扩大势力，建立跨有几个省的自治区。
    向达还诬称科学院党的领导是“外行领导内行”、“如张宗昌带兵”和他接触过的四、五十个共产党员中，除两人以外都遭受过他的恶意攻击。向达阴谋挑拨共产党与知识分子的关系。他恶毒地说：“党对非党人士有‘非我族类，其心必异’的思想，党把科学家看成是‘街头流浪者’，‘呼之则来，挥之则去。’”对于社会主义制度和马克思列宁主义，向达是深恶痛绝的。他诬蔑国家某些经济政策是“近乎竭泽而渔”或“饮鸩止渴”；诬蔑共产党号召干部参加体力劳动是“形式主义”，等等。
    会上许多人在批判向达时着重指出了知识分子进行思想改造的必要性。七十八岁的老教授、北京师范大学校长、中国科学院历史研究所第二所所长陈垣说，向达所以有这样的反共反社会主义言行，根本原因是阶级立场问题。北京市教育局局长、历史研究所第二所兼任研究员翁独健指出，旧知识分子成为右派分子，原因在于解放后抗拒思想改造。北京大学副校长汤用彤在他的书面发言中说，从对向达的批判中，他得到了一个教训，就是知识一定要为人民服务，知识分子一定要和工农群众相结合。北京市副市长、历史研究所第二所学术委员吴晗揭露了向达历史上一贯的反共、反人民的言行，揭穿了向达所自诩的“民主斗士”的假面具。
    天津南开大学历史系主任郑天挺在会上报告了天津史学界反击右派分子雷海宗的情况。这次座谈会上，哲学家孙定国、南开大学历史系教授吴廷璆等人对雷海宗的大量恶毒言行作了进一步的批判，指出雷海宗是以反教条主义为名来反对马列主义，企图为资产阶级社会科学和资本主义复辟铺平道路。
    座谈会同时对历史研究所第三所研究员、右派分子荣孟源和考古研究所研究员、右派分子陈梦家进行了严正的批判。
    北京大学历史系教授杨人楩的具有右派思想的言行在会上也受到了批判。
    右派分子向达、荣孟源、陈梦家都在会上作了检讨。右派分子雷海宗在天津，没有出席座谈会。
    座谈会结束时，历史研究所第三所所长范文澜对思想问题和政治问题的区别再一次作了阐说。他指出反右派斗争决不会影响百家争鸣的开展，今后百家争鸣的园地将会越加宽广自由。最后，哲学社会科学部常务委员、北京大学历史系教授翦伯赞作了总结发言。
