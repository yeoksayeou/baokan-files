　　Three Important Reforms of the Ministry of Education
    Revising Teaching Plans Streamlining Course Content Strengthening Political Education
    (Our dispatch) The Ministry of Education, in the course of rectification, is implementing the spirit of "rectifying while correcting," and has improved three major tasks in terms of professional work.
    First, the teaching plans for primary and secondary schools and secondary normal schools have been revised. At the Third National Education Administration Conference held in March this year, the Ministry of Education, based on opinions from various parties on the teaching plans of primary and secondary schools, discussed and formulated a draft teaching plan for primary and secondary schools and secondary normal schools for the 1957-1958 academic year. During the rectification period, the Ministry of Education sent this draft to local education departments for comments. Before the start of this academic year, the Ministry of Education concentrated cadres from relevant departments, conducted practical investigations and research, and made important revisions to the above three plans based on realistic and feasible requirements. In the new plan, in order to strengthen ideological and political education and labor education, political courses have been added to middle schools and secondary normal schools (primary schools conduct ideological and political education through weekly meetings); middle schools have added basic agricultural knowledge courses, and rural primary schools in the fifth and sixth grades have added general agricultural knowledge. In order to reduce the excessive number of categories in the teaching plan and reduce the excessive burden of student learning, some courses in middle schools have been reduced or suspended, or merged into related subjects for teaching. In addition, in order to adapt to the different situations in various regions, the Ministry of Education also stipulates that local authorities can make appropriate changes to the teaching plan in accordance with local conditions.
    Second, the textbook content of some courses in primary and secondary schools and normal schools has been streamlined. In order to reduce the burden on teachers and students and improve the quality of teaching, the Ministry of Education has adopted temporary measures to streamline textbooks that have already been published with excessive volume and overly deep content. For primary school Chinese, history, and geography, junior high school literature, Chinese language, world history, zoology, botany, senior high school modern and contemporary history, Chinese history, Chinese economic geography, physics, human anatomy, and secondary normal school Chinese history, physical geography, algebra, botany, zoology, and other courses, the Ministry of Education has formulated streamlined methods and distributed them to local schools for reference and implementation. The principle of streamlining is to streamline improperly selected materials, materials that are divorced from reality, content that is too deep, repeated content, secondary content, and overly complex materials without disrupting the curriculum system of each subject. In the process of streamlining teaching materials, the Ministry of Education repeatedly studied, convened seminars to solicit teachers' opinions by subject, put forward preliminary plans and distributed them to various places for comments, and then, after research, formulated streamlined methods.
    Third, strengthen ideological and political education in primary and secondary schools and secondary normal schools. Political courses have been set up in all grades of middle schools and secondary normal schools, weekly meetings have been set up in primary schools, and it is stipulated that the political course for the 1957-1958 academic year will focus on Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as the central content to conduct socialist ideological education. At present, the Ministry of Education is organizing forces to compile textbooks for middle school political courses for next year and to select and compile textbooks for socialist ideological education. At the same time, in order to strengthen labor education, the Ministry of Education is also studying and drafting a plan to organize secondary school students to participate in physical labor.

　　教育部三项重要改革
    修订教学计划  精简课程内容  加强政治教育
    本报讯  教育部在整风中，贯彻边整边改的精神，在业务上改进了三项主要工作。
    第一，修订了中小学和中等师范学校的教学计划。在今年3月间召开的第三次全国教育行政会议上，教育部曾根据各方面对中小学校教学计划提出的意见，讨论制订了1957—1958学年度中小学和中等师范学校的教学计划草案。整风期间，教育部将这草案发给各地教育厅局，征求意见。本学年度开学以前，教育部即从有关方面集中了干部力量，经过实际的调查研究，根据切实可行的要求，对以上的三个计划作了重要的修订。在新的计划中，为了加强思想政治教育和劳动教育，在中学和中等师范学校增加了政治课（小学通过周会进行思想政治教育）；中学增设了农业基础知识课，农村小学五、六年级增设农业常识。为了减少教学计划中过多的门类，减轻学生学习的过重负担，削减和暂停中学部分课程，或合并到有关学科中去讲授。此外，为了适应各地区的不同情况，教育部还规定各地可以因地制宜对教学计划作适当的变通。
    第二，精简中小学和师范学校一部分课程的教材内容。为了减轻师生负担和提高教学质量，教育部对已出版的一部分份量太重、内容太深的课本，采取了精简教材的临时措施。对小学语文、历史、地理，初中文学、汉语、世界历史、动物学、植物学，高中近代现代史、中国历史、中国经济地理、物理学、人体解剖学，中等师范学校的中国历史、自然地理、代数、植物学、动物学等课，教育部都已订出精简办法，发给各地学校参照执行。精简的原则是在不打乱各科课程系统的条件下，精简选材不当、脱离实际、内容过深、前后重复、次要的和头续繁多的教材。在精简教材工作过程中，教育部经过反复研究，分科召开座谈会征求教师的意见，提出初步方案发给各地征求意见，以后再经过研究，订出精简办法。
    第三，加强中小学和中等师范学校的思想政治教育。中学和中等师范学校各年级设置了政治课，小学设置了周会，并且规定1957—1958学年的政治课，以毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告为中心内容，进行社会主义思想教育。目前，教育部正在组织力量编写明年用的中学政治课教材和选辑社会主义思想教育的教材。同时，为了加强劳动教育，教育部还正在研究拟订组织中等学校学生参加体力劳动的方案。
