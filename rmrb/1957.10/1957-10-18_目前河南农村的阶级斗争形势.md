　　Current Class Struggle Situation in Rural Henan
　　Pan Fusheng, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Recently, I investigated the socialist education movement in Gengzhuang, Donglubao, Xilubao, and Nanlubao four second-class cooperatives and Dazhaoying and Huixian Mengzhuang two first-class cooperatives in Xinxiang County. Now, based on the findings of the investigation, I will analyze the rural situation. The purpose of carrying out the socialist education movement is to criticize the capitalist and individualistic thinking of the well-to-do middle peasants, to crack down on the illegal and destructive activities of landlords and rich peasants, and to overcome right-leaning ideas within the Party. This will enhance the socialist consciousness of all cadres, Party members, Youth League members, and the broad masses of peasants, and promote a new upsurge in building socialism. To ensure the smooth progress of the socialist education movement, we must first educate cadres and Party members to understand the current class struggle situation in rural areas, overcome right-leaning ideas, and successfully pass the socialist test.

We must resolutely trust the majority of the masses

I. Poor Peasants and Lower-Middle Peasants

The poor peasants and lower-middle peasants are the forces we resolutely rely on. The six cooperatives have a total of 189 poor peasant households, accounting for 13.54% of the total number of households. Among them, 72.47% support socialism, 23.3% are neutral, and 4.23% are backward. The six cooperatives have a total of 359 lower-middle peasant households, accounting for 25.75% of the total number of households. Among them, 66% support socialism, 28.7% are neutral, and 5.3% are backward. Among the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, those who are not highly aware and have opinions about socialism, as long as we strengthen our work and raise their socialist consciousness, with the exception of a very few, will support the Party and support socialism.

In summary, among the 1,393 households in the six cooperatives, there are 60 well-to-do middle peasant households with serious capitalist tendencies, and 64 backward old lower-middle peasants, lower-middle peasants, and poor peasants, totaling 124 households, accounting for 8.9% of the total number of households. There are 52 landlord and rich peasant households who are law-abiding or semi-law-abiding, accounting for 3.7% of the total number of households. Therefore, it can be said that the majority of people in rural areas support socialism. We must firmly believe in the majority of the masses; this is our basic starting point. In the struggle between the two roads, the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants resolutely defend socialism. They actively demand a socialist great debate with the well-to-do middle peasants who have serious capitalist tendencies, and at the same time crack down on the current offenders of landlords and rich peasants who are trying to settle accounts. However, many cadres are not ideologically clear about this new situation of class struggle. We must educate all cadres to recognize the rural situation and unswervingly believe in the majority of the masses. Any right-leaning ideas that dare not let go and carry out great debates and great contentions in rural areas must be resolutely overcome.

II. Old Lower-Middle Peasants

Generally speaking, old lower-middle peasants are in a neutral state in the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism.

The six cooperatives have a total of 458 old lower-middle peasant households, accounting for 33.06% of the total number of households. Among them, 51.33% support socialism, 40.6% are neutral, and 8.07% are backward. The opinions of the old lower-middle peasants on cooperatives and the unified purchase and sale of grain are generally about how to improve the work. Economically, compared with before joining the advanced cooperative, their situation is generally unchanged, or slightly reduced, or slightly increased. Very few of them are backward.

III. Well-to-do Middle Peasants

Most of the well-to-do middle peasants are willing to stay in the cooperatives, and a few want to withdraw and take the capitalist road. The results of the survey of the six cooperatives are: there are a total of 283 well-to-do middle peasant households (125 new well-to-do middle peasant households and 158 old well-to-do middle peasant households), accounting for 20.2% of the total number of households. Among them, 114 households support socialism, accounting for 40.3%; 109 households are neutral, accounting for 38.5%; and 60 households have serious capitalist tendencies, accounting for 21.2%. According to the statistics of five cooperatives, there are a total of 83 new well-to-do middle peasant households, with 55.35% supporting socialism; 31.3% are neutral, and 13.35% have serious capitalist tendencies. There are 113 old well-to-do middle peasant households, with 30.4% supporting socialism, 43% are neutral, and 26.6% have serious capitalist tendencies. Among the well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist tendencies, a very small number are demanding withdrawal from the cooperative and want to take the capitalist road. For example, in the Dazhaoying cooperative, there are six out of 87 well-to-do middle peasant households, accounting for slightly less than 7%; in the Mengzhuang cooperative, there are five out of 70 well-to-do middle peasant households, accounting for 7.14%.

The well-to-do middle peasants who support socialism generally have the following characteristics: their agricultural income is slightly increased or unchanged compared with before joining the advanced cooperative, or slightly decreased. Politically, they are generally relatively pure and upright peasants with a higher socialist consciousness, including cadres, cadre family members, and military dependents. The neutral well-to-do middle peasants generally have unchanged or slightly decreased income compared with before joining the advanced cooperative, but not too much. The primary cooperatives had a good influence on them in the past. These people can take the socialist road as long as we work earnestly and strengthen education. The well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist tendencies generally have a greater reduction in income (after joining the advanced cooperative, they have less labor, are not active in production, and cannot engage in exploitation). Politically, they used to have a higher status, having served as Bao chiefs or Jia chiefs, and some have been struggled against politically. As for the well-to-do middle peasants who are demanding withdrawal from the cooperative and want to take the capitalist road, their number is extremely small. These households have a significant reduction in income economically, had a relatively high political status in the past, and are generally close to the edge of becoming rich peasants. Individual households are rich peasants who were missed during the peaceful land reform. The majority of well-to-do middle peasants are willing to take the socialist road together with the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and their participation in agricultural cooperatives is voluntary. However, some people were swept in by the upsurge of socialist transformation and are not fully conscious. Therefore, after actually participating in collective production activities and income distribution, they feel very "unfree" and feel that they have "suffered a loss" economically, and are dissatisfied with the cooperative. Some new well-to-do middle peasants saved money and bought land after the land reform, their economic situation has changed, and their capitalist ideas have developed seriously. After joining the advanced cooperative, they cannot take the capitalist road, and they resist the socialist system and even have anti-socialist words and deeds.

The well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist tendencies mainly struggle with us on two issues: the unified purchase and sale of grain and collectivization. They also have great complaints about urban-rural relations and worker-peasant relations. They take the lead in shouting that there is not enough food in the countryside, and individual ones take the lead in demanding withdrawal from the cooperative, demanding that the government implement a "fixed rent system," contract work to households, and pay rent to the cooperative according to the amount of land. They are passive and lazy in production, and when dealing with the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, they play a negative role, deliberately undermining the interests of the state and the interests of the cooperative.

These well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist tendencies who want to take the capitalist road must be criticized and transformed. The main method to adopt is ideological criticism combined with stating facts and reasoning, to fully explain the reasons, not to arbitrarily label them, and not to lose the sympathy of the general middle peasants. Because although the well-to-do middle peasants have capitalist tendencies and have a wavering side during the period of socialist transformation, they are part of the laboring peasants. We must adopt the policy of educating, uniting, and striving for them, and resolutely relying on the poor peasants (including the lower-middle peasants) and uniting the middle peasants (including the well-to-do middle peasants), adhere to the principle of being reasonable and restrained, carry out ideological struggle, and refute their capitalist ideas.

Crack Down on the Sabotage Activities of Saboteurs

The six cooperatives have a total of 104 landlord and rich peasant households, accounting for 7.45% of the total number of households. Among them, 50% are law-abiding, 16.35% are semi-law-abiding, and 33.65% are illegal (these six cooperatives are all in peaceful land reform areas in the winter of 1949 and the spring of 1950, the mobilization of the masses was relatively poor, so the scope of illegal households is wider, and cannot represent the general area). Landlords and rich peasants are classes that have been overthrown and eliminated, but some landlord and rich peasant elements are not reconciled to their demise and will carry out sabotage whenever they have the opportunity. We must exercise dictatorship over these elements. Counter-revolutionary elements should be dealt with in accordance with the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. We must exercise dictatorship over bad elements. Currently, serious crimes such as hooliganism, theft, homicide, rape, fraud, disruption of public order, serious violations of law and discipline, and people publicly recognized as bad people in rural areas must be punished according to law. Of course, in carrying out this work, it is necessary to strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions with different natures. Deal with them using two different methods.

Implement the Party's Class Line in Rural Areas

The majority of Party members and cadres in rural areas have good backgrounds, firm stances, and are loyally fighting for the socialist cause. They are supported by the broad masses of peasants. However, according to inaccurate statistics from Mengzhuang, Gengzhuang, and other five cooperatives, the proportion of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants in the leadership of three of the cooperatives is not dominant. The Donglubao cooperative, which has the smallest proportion, has only 22.2% of its cooperative cadres coming from poor peasant and lower-middle peasant backgrounds. This should be adjusted appropriately during the Party rectification and cooperative rectification. The six cooperatives have a total of 113 Party members (those from well-to-do middle peasant backgrounds account for a little over 22%). Their work is mostly good, but some Party members and cadres have a vague understanding of the current class struggle situation in rural areas and have not firmly defended the principles of socialism. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome the right-leaning ideas of Party members and cadres and implement the class line, relying on the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants to criticize capitalist ideas when carrying out socialist education.

The class struggle between the two roads in society is reflected in the Party, which is the main problem existing in the Party at present. Therefore, it is very necessary to carry out Party rectification in a step-by-step manner in the socialist education movement. The content of Party rectification is: First, to carry out education on the two roads, criticize capitalist ideas, establish socialist ideas, and raise socialist ideological consciousness. Second, to implement the Party's class line in rural areas, firmly rely on the poor peasants and unite the middle peasants, and Party members should ensure the correct implementation of the Party and the state's various policies and laws. Third, to rectify the Party's work style, overcome the commandist work style of being divorced from the masses, and strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses. Fourth, to carry out education on serving the people, consulting with the masses on matters, bearing hardships before enjoying comforts, and practicing criticism and self-criticism.

Great Debates Must Be Combined with Current Work

In the socialist great debate, we must be good at grasping the main contradictions and solving them thoroughly. At present, we should first grasp the issue of grain and the unified purchase and sale, and launch a comprehensive great debate. We must closely combine the current political and ideological socialist revolution with current work, avoid all generalized propaganda. Therefore, the content of the socialist great debate should generally pay attention to:

First, link the great debate on the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain with the completion of the unified purchase of grain and the state's planned purchase of unified purchased materials, and according to the specific ideas exposed in the great debates and contentions in various places, grasp the problems and launch debates. For example, is the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain good or bad? Is the grain retention standard reasonable or not? Is it right to conceal production? How to fundamentally solve the grain problem, etc.

Second, link the debate on the road of collectivization with how to run the cooperatives well and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture, such as whether the cooperatives are superior or not, whether joining the cooperatives is free or not, who benefits from joining the cooperatives, whether the cooperatives have a future, etc.

Third, urban-rural relations and worker-peasant relations. In terms of the lives of workers and peasants, who produces more value? How much difference is there between the income of workers and the income of peasants? What is the socialist principle of distribution? Should there be a reasonable difference between the lives of workers and peasants? Is absolute egalitarianism right? Is the life of peasants hard?

In terms of the price difference between industrial and agricultural products, should there be reasonable price differences for coal, salt, etc., or not?

Fourth, combine the debate on abiding by the socialist legal system with overcoming the individualistic ideas of peasants who only care about their personal interests and disregard the interests of the state. Currently, some peasants with serious capitalist ideas violate the state's market management policies and sell materials planned for purchase and unified purchase by the state to private merchants, engaging in black market transactions. Therefore, it should be proposed whether it is right to violate the state's market management, whether it is right to violate the state's unified purchase policy and various economic laws, etc. Through debate, peasants should realize that engaging in speculative illegal activities, disrupting the state's market management, and taking the capitalist road are not beneficial to the state, nor are they beneficial to the peasants.

Fifth, launch a debate on the socialist economic law of the correct proportion of production level and consumption level. At present, the phenomenon of peasants demanding excessively high consumption levels is relatively serious. They believe that collectivization has communized everything, and they cannot buy land anymore, so they demand to eat well and dress well, ignoring the fundamental issue of accumulating and expanding reproduction. Therefore, we should discuss whether it is good to produce as much as we eat, how can we produce more and improve our lives better, and what is the correct principle? This debate should be combined with the education of building the country with diligence and thrift, running cooperatives with diligence and thrift, and managing households with diligence and thrift, and combined with the education of loving the country, loving the community, and loving the family.

Sixth, the issue of democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline. At present, the phenomenon of some cooperative members not abiding by labor discipline is relatively serious, the production efficiency is low, and the quality of work is poor. It is necessary to launch a debate to create a lively political situation with both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom.

Several Issues to Pay Attention To

In the process of investigating the six cooperatives, I saw the following problems existing in the current socialist education movement:

First, many cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of this socialist education movement. They only see it as a general political and ideological education movement, and some even think that it is simply to complete the task of grain procurement and to crack down on the illegal activities of landlords and rich peasants. They have not truly realized that the socialist education movement is a great debate between socialist and capitalist ideas, and a great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts.

Some cadres have failed to use Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as a weapon and use the method of class analysis to clearly analyze the basic situation in rural areas. They generally only pay attention to the sabotage activities of landlords and rich peasants (which is correct), but they do not have a sufficient understanding of the situation of the well-to-do middle peasant class, and they have a vague understanding of the situation of the struggle between the two roads. The guiding ideology is not clear enough. This must be further resolved.

Second, overcome right-leaning ideas within the Party and further carry out the socialist education movement. At present, right-leaning ideas within the Party and the ideological lagging behind the situation are specifically manifested in an insufficient understanding of the capitalist tendencies of the well-to-do middle peasant class. They still treat the new well-to-do middle peasants from the perspective of the bourgeois democratic revolution period. Many cadres believe that the new well-to-do middle peasants were active elements in the land reform and will not oppose socialism. They have not considered that although these people were active elements in the democratic revolution period, in the current stage of building socialism, the private ownership of the means of production has been completely abolished, and some of them have wavered. On the socialist direction, we must never accommodate these wavering well-to-do middle peasants. Therefore, we must launch a great debate with their capitalist and individualistic ideas. If the right-leaning ideas within the Party are not thoroughly overcome and we fail to pass the socialist test successfully, we will not be able to lead the masses well to pass the socialist test. The more thoroughly the right-leaning ideas within the Party are overcome, the more thoroughly the socialist revolution will be carried out.

Third, in the socialist education movement, we must learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people, learn the method of taking the mass line, and change our work style. The method of nationwide great debate is also the method of the mass line, which is also the method of correctly handling contradictions among the people. However, some of our comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of this. They believe that the current socialist education is that the leadership is supporting the cadres again, and they believe that they can use the method of coercion to deal with the people's ideological problems again, which is completely wrong.

Fourth, the socialist education movement is an educational movement with a high degree of political, ideological, and policy orientation. Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over this movement. The first secretary of the Party committee must personally grasp this movement and strengthen the ideological and policy leadership of the movement. In the debate, we must understand the ideological trends of the masses at any time and dispel ideological concerns in a timely manner.

Fifth, it is necessary to implement the policy of "rectifying and correcting at the same time," classify the opinions raised by the masses in the great debates and contentions, and adopt the good ones, and criticize the bad ones.

Sixth, regarding the steps for carrying out the movement. In addition to holding a good three-level cadre meeting, within the cooperative, we should generally adhere to the principle of starting from within the Party to outside the Party, from the backbone to the masses. First, hold a good meeting of the Party branch committee, clarify the significance, purpose, and basic practices of carrying out this movement, analyze the situation of the cooperative, grasp the main problems, and seek consensus. We must properly arrange production so that the movement becomes the driving force for promoting production.

Seventh, generally speaking, we should first carry out the socialist great debate, and then deal with the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionary elements, and bad elements, because this will not affect the great debates and contentions, and the exposure of the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionary elements, and bad elements will be thorough, accurate, and forceful. Of course, in some cooperatives (such as backward cooperatives), if the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionary elements, and bad elements are not cracked down, it will not be possible to launch great debates and contentions among the masses. Then, we should first crack down on the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionary elements, and bad elements, and then carry out great debates and contentions, and launch the socialist great debate.

Eighth, in the debate, we must pay attention to analyzing and distinguishing between two types of contradictions with different natures, distinguishing between correct opinions and wrong opinions; distinguishing between fallacies against socialism and certain skeptical and dissatisfied remarks among the peasants; and for some different views and opinions of cadres and the masses on work, we must carefully consider them and not blindly criticize them.

Ninth, carrying out the socialist education movement must be closely combined with grain procurement and other state-planned purchases, unified purchase of materials, and production and disaster relief, etc., as a driving force to promote various tasks, and not delay production.

　　目前河南农村的阶级斗争形势
　　中共河南省委第一书记　潘复生
    最近，我考察了新乡县耿庄、东鲁堡、西鲁堡、南鲁堡四个二类社和大召营及辉县孟庄两个一类社开展社会主义教育运动的情况。现在，就考察的情况，分析一下农村形势。开展社会主义教育运动的目的是，批判富裕中农的资本主义思想和个人主义思想，打击地主、富农的违法破坏活动，克服党内右倾思想。从而提高全体干部、党团员与广大农民的社会主义觉悟，促进建设社会主义的新高潮。要使社会主义教育运动顺利开展，必须首先教育干部和党员，认识当前农村阶级斗争形势，克服右倾思想，过好社会主义关。
    要坚决地信任群众的多数
    一，贫农、下中农
    贫农、下中农是我们坚决依靠的力量。六个社共有贫农一百八十九户，占总户数的13.54％。其中拥护社会主义的占72.47％；中间的占23.3％；落后的占4.23％。六个社共有下中农三百五十九户，占总户数的25.75％。其中拥护社会主义的占66％；中间的占28.7％；落后的占5.3％。贫农和下中农中觉悟不高、对社会主义有意见的人，只要我们加强工作，提高其社会主义觉悟，除极个别的以外，他们是会拥护党、拥护社会主义的。
    综上所述，在六个社的一千三百九十三户中有严重资本主义倾向的富裕中农六十户，落后的老下中农、下中农、贫农六十四户，合计一百二十四户，占总户数8.9％。不守法、半守法的地主、富农五十二户，占总户数的3.7％。因此，可以说农村中的大多数是拥护社会主义的。我们必须坚定地相信群众的多数，这是我们的基本出发点。在两条道路斗争中，贫农和下中农坚决地捍卫社会主义，他们积极要求与有严重资本主义倾向的富裕中农进行社会主义大辩论，同时打击地主、富农反攻倒算的现行犯。然而，这一阶级斗争的新形势，却有不少干部在思想上是不够明确的，我们必须教育全体干部，认清农村形势，坚定不移地相信群众的大多数，任何不敢放手在农村中开展大鸣大放大争的右倾思想，都必须坚决克服。
    二，老下中农
    老下中农一般说在社会主义与资本主义两条道路的斗争中处于中间状态。
    六个社共有老下中农四百五十八户，占总户数的33.06％，其中拥护社会主义的占51.33％，中间的占40.6％，落后的占8.07％。老下中农对合作社、粮食统购统销的意见，一般是为了如何搞好工作。他们在经济上与入高级社前相比，总的说是不增不减，或者稍有减少，或者有所增加。他们当中落后的为数很少。
    三，富裕中农
    富裕中农多数愿意留在合作社，少数闹退社，想走资本主义道路。六个社调查的结果是：共有富裕中农二百八十三户（新富裕中农一百二十五户，老富裕中农一百五十八户），占总户数的20.2％。其中拥护社会主义的一百一十四户，占40.3％；中间的一百零九户，占38.5％；有严重资本主义倾向的六十户，占21.2％。据五个社的统计，共有新富裕中农八十三户，拥护社会主义的占55.35％；中间的占31.3％，有严重资本主义倾向的占13.35％。老富裕中农一百一十三户，拥护社会主义的占30.4％，中间的占43％，有严重资本主义倾向的占26.6％。有严重资本主义倾向的富裕中农中，闹退社，想走资本主义道路的是极少数的。如大召营社八十七户富裕中农中有六户，占7％弱；孟庄社七十户富裕中农中有五户，占7.14％。
    拥护社会主义的富裕中农，一般是：在经济上农业收入比入高级社以前稍有增加或不增不减，或稍有减少。在政治上，一般是比较纯洁的正派农民，社会主义觉悟较高，其中有干部、干部家属和军属等。中间的富裕中农，在经济上，比入高级社以前不增不减，或有减少但不太多，过去初级社对他们有好影响。在政治上，资本主义思想不严重，有的当过伪街长、甲长等。这些人，只要我们认真进行工作，加强教育，是可以走社会主义道路的。有严重资本主义倾向的富裕中农，在经济上一般是收入减少的较多（入高级社后，劳动力少、生产不积极、不能进行剥削），在政治上，过去比较有地位，当过保长、甲长，有的在政治上被斗争过。至于闹退社，想走资本主义道路的富裕中农，为数极少，这些户在经济上收入减少很多，政治上过去较有地位，一般是接近富农的边缘，有个别户是和平土改中漏掉的富农。富裕中农的大多数是愿意同贫农和下中农一起走社会主义道路的，他们参加农业社是自愿的。但是，有些人是被社会主义改造高潮卷进来的，并没有充分的自觉。因此，在实际上参加了集体的生产活动和收益分配以后，他们感到很“不自由”，感到经济上“吃了亏”，对合作社不满。有些新富裕中农土地改革后省吃俭用置庄买田，经济情况发生了变化，资本主义思想严重地发展起来，入高级社后不能走资本主义道路了，对社会主义制度有抵触，甚至有反社会主义的言行。
    富裕中农中有严重资本主义倾向的，主要在两个问题上与我们斗争，一个是粮食统购统销，一个是合作化。在城乡关系和工农关系上，他们也有很大牢骚。他们在农村带头叫喊粮食不够吃，个别的带头闹退社，要求政府实行“死租制”，包工包产到户，按地亩给合作社交租。他们对生产消极怠工，在处理国家、集体和个人之间的关系的时候，他们起了消极作用，蓄意破坏国家利益和合作社的利益。
    对这些有严重资本主义倾向想走资本主义道路的富裕中农，必须进行批评改造。主要采取思想批判与摆事实讲道理的方法去解决，要充分的说理，不要乱扣帽子，不要失去一般中农的同情。因为富裕中农虽有资本主义倾向，在社会主义改造时期具有动摇的一面，但是他们是劳动农民的一部分，必须采取教育、团结争取和坚决依靠贫农（包括下中农）、团结中农（包括富裕中农）的方针，坚持有理有节的原则，开展说理斗争，把他们的资本主义思想驳倒。
    打击破坏分子的破坏活动
    六个社地主、富农共有一百零四户，占总户数的7.45％，其中守法的占50％，半守法的占16.35％，违法的占33.65％（这六个社都是于1949年冬、1950年春和平土改地区，群众发动比较差，所以违法户的面较宽，不能代表一般地区）。地主、富农是已经被打倒、消灭了的阶级，但有些地主、富农分子并不甘心死亡，一有机会，就进行破坏。我们对这些分子必须实行专政。对反革命分子，应按照镇压反革命政策处理。对坏分子必须实行专政。目前农村流氓、盗窃、凶杀、强奸犯、诈骗犯、破坏公共秩序、严重违法乱纪等严重犯罪以及公众公认为坏人的人必须依法惩办。当然，在进行这一工作时，要严格区别两类不同性质的矛盾。用两种不同的办法来处理。
    贯彻执行党在农村中的阶级路线
    农村的大多数党员和干部出身好，立场坚定，忠诚地为社会主义事业奋斗，他们是广大农民所拥护的。但据孟庄、耿庄等五个社的不精确统计，其中三个社的领导成分中，贫农、下中农都不占优势，占比重最少的东鲁堡社贫农和下中农成分的社干部仅占全社干部总数的22.2％。应在整党整社中适当加以调整。六个社共一百一十三个党员（富裕中农出身的占22％强），他们的工作大都是好的，但是，也有一部分党员和干部，对目前农村的阶级斗争形势认识模糊，没有坚决维护社会主义的原则。因此，在进行社会主义教育时，必须克服党员、干部右倾思想，贯彻阶级路线，依靠贫农、下中农批判资本主义思想。
    社会上两条道路的阶级斗争反映到党内来，是目前党内存在的主要问题。因此，在社会主义教育运动中有步骤地进行整党就十分必要。整党的内容是：第一，进行两条道路的教育，批判资本主义思想，树立社会主义思想，提高社会主义思想觉悟。第二，贯彻执行党在农村的阶级路线，坚定不移地依靠贫农、团结中农，党员要保证党和国家的各项政策法令正确贯彻执行。第三，整顿党的作风，克服脱离群众的强迫命令作风，密切党群关系。第四，进行为人民服务，有事和群众商量，吃苦在前得利在后，实行批评和自我批评的教育。
    大辩论必须结合当前工作
    在社会主义大辩论中，要善于抓住主要矛盾，进行深透的解决。目前应首先抓住粮食、统购统销问题，展开全面性的大辩论。要把当前政治上思想上社会主义革命和当前工作密切地结合起来，避免一切泛泛的宣传，因此社会主义大辩论的内容一般的应该注意：
    第一，把粮食统购统销政策的大辩论与完成粮食统购和国家计划收购统一收购的物资联系起来，并根据各地大鸣大放中暴露的具体思想，抓住问题，展开辩论。如粮食统购统销政策好不好？留粮标准合理不合理？隐瞒产量对不对？怎样从根本上解决粮食问题等。
    第二，把合作化道路的辩论与怎样办好合作社、争取农业大丰收联系起来，如合作社优越不优越、入了合作社自由不自由、入了合作社谁沾谁的光、合作社有没有前途等。
    第三，城乡关系、工农关系问题。工人与农民生活方面，算谁生产的价值大？工人收入与农民收入究竟差多少？社会主义的分配原则是什么？工人与农民的生活是不是应该有个合理差别？绝对平均主义对不对？农民生活是否苦？
    在工、农业产品差价方面，主要是煤、盐等合理差价应该有不应该有？
    第四，把进行遵守社会主义法制的辩论和克服农民只顾个人利益不顾国家利益的个人主义思想结合起来。目前有些有严重资本主义思想的农民，违背国家市场管理政策，把国家计划收购和统一收购物资卖给私商，进行黑市交易。因此，应提出不遵守国家市场管理对不对、违犯国家统购政策和各项经济法令对不对等。通过辩论使农民认识：进行投机违法活动、破坏国家市场管理、走资本主义道路，对国家不利，对农民也是不利的。
    第五，展开生产水平和消费水平的正确比例的社会主义经济法则的辩论，目前农民对消费水平要求过高的现象是比较严重的，他们认为合作化共了产，不能置庄买地了，要求吃好穿好，忽视了积累扩大再生产这个根本问题。因此，应讨论生产多少吃多少好不好？如何才能生产的更多，生活改善的好？正确的原则是什么？这个辩论和勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家教育结合起来进行；和爱国、爱社、爱家教育结合起来进行。
    第六，民主与集中、自由与纪律问题。目前合作社有些社员不遵守劳动纪律的现象比较严重，生产效率低，做活质量差。需要开展一次辩论，造成一个又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，生动活泼的政治局面。
    应该注意的几个问题
    在考察六个合作社的过程中，看到当前开展社会主义教育运动中存在以下几个问题：
    第一，不少干部对这次社会主义教育运动的重大意义认识不足。仅仅看成是一般性的政治思想教育运动，甚至有的认为单纯是为了完成粮食征购任务，为了打击地主、富农的不法活动。没有真正认识到社会主义教育运动是社会主义思想与资本主义思想的一场大论战，是一个在政治战线上和思想战线上的伟大的社会主义革命。
    有些干部未能以毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告为武器，用阶级分析的方法，把农村的基本形势分析清楚。一般只注意了地主、富农的破坏活动（这是对的），但对富裕中农这个阶层的情况了解的不够，对两条道路的斗争形势认识模糊，指导思想不够清醒。这是必须进一步求得解决的。
    第二，克服党内右倾思想，进一步开展社会主义教育运动。目前党内右倾思想和思想落后于形势，具体表现在对于富裕中农这个阶层的资本主义倾向认识不足，对新富裕中农，还是以资产阶级民主革命时期的观点来看待。许多干部认为新富裕中农是土地改革中的积极分子，不会反对社会主义，他们没有考虑到这些人在民主革命时期虽然是积极分子，但是在现阶段在建设社会主义的时期，彻底废除了生产资料的私有制，他们有些人就动摇了。在社会主义的方向上，我们决不能迁就这些动摇的富裕中农，因此，必须与他们的资本主义思想和个人主义思想展开大辩论。党内不彻底克服右倾思想，过好社会主义关，就不能很好地领导群众过社会主义关，党内右倾思想克服的越彻底，社会主义革命进行的就越彻底。
    第三，在社会主义教育运动中，要学会正确处理人民内部矛盾，学会走群众路线的方法，改变我们的作风。全民性的大辩论的方法，也就是群众路线的方法，也就是正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法。但是，我们有些同志对这一点认识不足，认为现在开展社会主义教育，是领导又给干部撑腰了，认为又可以用压服的办法来对待人民的思想问题了，这是十分错误的。
    第四，社会主义教育运动是一次有高度政治性、思想性、政策性的教育运动，各级党委必须加强对这一运动的领导，党委第一书记要把这一运动亲自掌握起来，加强对运动的思想领导和政策领导。在辩论中要随时了解群众思想动态，及时解除思想顾虑。
    第五，要贯彻执行“边整边改”的方针，对群众在鸣放中所提出的意见，要分类排队，择其善者而从之，其不善者批判之。
    第六，关于运动开展的步骤。除开好三级干部会议以外，在社内一般应坚持从党内到党外，由骨干到群众。首先开好党支部委员会，明确开展这次运动的意义、目的和基本做法，分析本社形势，抓住主要问题，求得认识一致，要妥善安排生产，使运动成为推动生产的动力。
    第七，一般地应该首先开展社会主义大辩论，然后处理地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子的破坏活动，因为这样不至于影响鸣放，而且对地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子破坏活动揭露的彻底打得准和狠。当然，在有些社（如落后社）不打击地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子的破坏活动，就不能在群众中展开鸣放者，则应先打击地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子的破坏活动，然后再进行大鸣大放，展开社会主义大辩论。
    第八，在辩论中，必须注意分析区别两类不同性质的矛盾，区别正确的意见和错误的意见；区别反对社会主义的谬论和农民中某些怀疑、不满言论；对于干部和群众在工作上的一些不同看法和意见，要慎重考虑，不要盲目批判。
    第九，开展社会主义教育运动，必须密切结合生产粮食征购及其他国家计划收购、统一收购物资和生产救灾等工作，作为推动各项工作的动力，不要误了生产。
