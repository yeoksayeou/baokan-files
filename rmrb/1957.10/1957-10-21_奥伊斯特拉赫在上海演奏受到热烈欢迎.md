Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th - World-renowned violinist David Oistrakh has concluded his visit and performances in Shanghai and left for Beijing this morning, laden with honors.

On the 18th, Oistrakh was invited to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, where he gave a brilliant performance for more than a thousand teachers and students of the conservatory. Their enthusiastic cheers and applause prevented the music master from ending the performance, and at their continued request, he performed five more pieces as encores.

After the performance, Oistrakh spoke to the students of the Conservatory of Music, listened to the students' violin playing, and offered many valuable suggestions. To thank Oistrakh and the famous pianist and accompanist Yang Polsky for their kindness, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music presented them with an exquisite jade tripod and an ivory-carved sailboat.

Oistrakh gave a total of three performances in Shanghai, with an audience of more than 5,000 people. The Grand Guangming Cinema, where the concerts were held, sold more than 400 standing-room tickets for the first time in its twenty-five-year history. This is a phenomenon that has not occurred in the cultural life of the people of Shanghai for many years.

    奥伊斯特拉赫在上海演奏受到热烈欢迎
    新华社上海19日电  世界著名小提琴家奥伊斯特拉赫已结束在上海的访问演奏，于今日上午载誉离沪赴北京。
    奥伊斯特拉赫于18日应邀到上海音乐学院，为这个学院一千多个师生作了精彩的演奏。他们狂热的欢呼和喝彩，使这位音乐大师无法结束演奏，在他们一直要求下，他又连续加演了五个曲子。
    奥伊斯特拉赫在演奏完毕后，对音乐学院学生讲了话，听了学生的小提琴演奏，对学生演奏提了不少宝贵的意见。为了答谢奥伊斯特拉赫和著名钢琴家、伴奏者杨波尔斯基的盛情，上海音乐学院将一座精致的翠玉鼎和一艘象牙雕刻帆船分赠给他们。
    奥伊斯特拉赫在上海共演出三场，听众有五千多人。举行演奏会的大光明电影院自建立二十五年以来第一次加卖了四百多张站票。这是多年来上海人民文化生活中从未有过的现象。
