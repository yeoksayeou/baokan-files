　　Lu Xun's Former Residence
　　Cai Yan
    ——On the desk in the former residence, the word "early" is engraved.
　　I stand beside this desk,
　　The word "early" engraved on the desk enters my sight,
　　I carefully examine this word,
　　A feeling of unspeakable respect surges in my heart.
　　One day he was late for school,
　　He engraved the word "early" to warn himself,
　　His "early" was also engraved in his heart,
　　From then on, he always arrived at school on time.
　　Today, how many people like me come to visit the study,
　　Today, how many people see this word "early" on the desk,
　　A strong character is formed in childhood,
　　This word "early" still shines brightly after sixty years...

    ——故居书桌上，刻着个“早”字。
　　我站在这张书桌的旁边，
　　桌上刻着的那个“早”字进入我的眼帘，
　　我细细地端详这个字呀，
　　心窝里涌起了难以言说的敬意。
　　有一天他迟到了学塾，
　　他刻上了“早”字把自己警戒，
　　他的“早”字也刻在自己胸头呀，
　　从此他总准时来到学堂。
　　今天有多少个和我一样的人来书屋参观，
　　今天有多少人在书桌上看到了这个早字，
　　刚毅的性格童稚的时候就养成，
　　这个“早”字六十年以后还亮光闪闪……
