Ode to October

    Singing on Red Square
    Tian Jian
    ——In 1954, when I visited Red Square, I wanted to write a poem and had fragments of ideas. Now I write it to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution.
    The twentieth-century Homer plays his dombra
    In symphonic sound he says his youth has returned
    Dombra, young heart, sing, sing, sing!
    He walks from one tent to another
    There is no place in the world that can be called his home
    Lenin's great name summoned him to Red Square
  (It is not the dombra that echoes in the Red Square, it is his heart!)
    Lenin is like a petrel
    He calls for the storm
    He calls for millions to knock down the Tsar's golden crown
    The despicable golden crown on the Tsar's head was blown away by a great wind
    The despicable golden crown fell to the ground
    It landed in an orchard
    And finally became a wooden barrel
    Workers use it to hold oil
    Farmers also raise silver cups
    Filled with grape wine
    We are not telling myths
    We are telling all facts——
    "Look, the darkness has been dispelled, the red light is ahead!" (Note 1)
    We are like oak trees
    Growing up beside Lenin
    Those huge branches
    A branch is a long axe
    The descendants of the proletariat took up this long axe
    They embarked on heroic icebreakers from the Arctic station
    Soon there will be this day
    They will conquer the universe
    Sing! Red warriors
    Sing, sing, sing!
    The place where the sun rises——you, Red Square!
    The paradise of granite buildings——you, Red Square!
  (It has overcome the atomic bomb and also overcome time)
    On your golden square
    The bells are ringing
    Whoever comes here
    He can get strength
    Birds can find wings
    Trees can find sunlight
    Engineers can find iron
    Young people can find ideals
    The chimes of the Kremlin bells are ringing
    Rushing from Lenin Hills
    It will travel all over the world
    It warns the tyrants of the world
    If you want peaceful coexistence
    Send your weapons to the museum
    The carnival season is coming again
    Standing in Red Square and looking around
    Great Soviet people
    Wise, courageous, and strong
  "Whoever wants to advance with him
    He will certainly never perish" (Note 2)
    Whoever fights for peace
    Let us sing together!
    (Note 1) Excerpt from the Soviet song "Hymn to Light."
    (Note 2) Excerpt from the Soviet song "Happy People."

    在红场上行吟
    田间
    ——1954年，我游览红场时，曾想写一首诗，有过片断的构思。现在把它写出来，以纪念十月革命四十周年。念十月革命四十周年。二十世纪的荷马弹起他的冬卜拉在交响声中他说他的青春回来啦冬卜拉年青的心唱吧，唱吧，唱吧！他从这一个帐幕走向另一个帐幕世界上没有一处可以说是他的家列宁伟大的名字把他召唤到红场
  （在红场上铮铮交响的不是冬卜拉是他的心呀）列宁像一只海燕他呼唤着暴风雨他呼唤着千百万人打落沙皇的金冠沙皇卑污头上的金冠被一阵大风吹走卑污的金冠堕下地它落在果木园里终于变成了木桶工人用它来装石油农夫也把银杯高举装满了葡萄美酒我们讲的不是神话讲的全是事实——“你看那黑暗已消灭，红色的光在前头！”（注一）我们好像是橡树在列宁的身边长大那些巨大的枝干一棵枝干就是一把长斧无产阶级的子孙拿起了这把长斧他们从北极站上登上英勇的破冰船不久将有这一天他们会把宇宙征服唱吧！红色的战士唱吧，唱吧，唱吧！太阳升起的地方——你呵，红场！花岗石建筑的天堂——你呵，红场！（它战胜了原子弹并也战胜了时间）在你金色的广场上钟声在当当鸣响不论是谁走到这里他就能得到力量鸟儿能找到羽翼树木能找到阳光工程师能找到铁青年人能找到理想克里姆林宫的钟声当当地鸣响从列宁山上奔腾它要走遍全世界它警告世上的暴君你想要和平共处把你的武器送进博物馆狂欢时节又将到来站在红场举目四望伟大的苏维埃人明智、果敢、强壮
  “谁愿意跟他前进他一定永远不会灭亡”（注二）谁为和平而斗争我们就一起歌唱！
