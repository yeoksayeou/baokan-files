Xinhua News Agency, October 8th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Socialist Party and Ibaraki Prefecture's labor unions jointly filed a complaint with the Mito District Public Prosecutors Office on October 7th, accusing US Air Force pilot Gordon of deliberately killing Japanese elderly woman Haru Hojo.

On August 2nd, Gordon was piloting a plane taking off from the US military base in Mito when the plane suddenly flew at low altitude near Nakaminato City, Ibaraki Prefecture, thereby killing Haru Hojo and injuring her son. US military authorities later defended themselves, saying that Gordon's plane flew low due to adverse conditions at the time.

The indictment submitted to the Mito District Public Prosecutors Office by Japanese Socialist Party Diet member Tsunayoshi Hosoda and representatives of Ibaraki Prefecture labor unions refuted that the plane's low flight was not due to adverse conditions at the time, but rather a deliberate homicide by the pilot Gordon. The indictment said that this behavior did not fall within the scope of performing official duties, and therefore Japan has the right to try Gordon.

The Nakaminato City Council had passed a resolution on August 15th, demanding that the Japanese Diet thoroughly pursue the responsibility for the incident of Haru Hojo's death with the US government.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 9th: Seoul dispatch: The South Korean National Federation of Cultural Organizations drafted a protest letter on October 8th, strongly protesting to General Decker, Commander of the US Eighth Army, against the US soldiers' continuous atrocities of killing South Korean people.

The protest letter said that they could not but feel angry about the atrocities of US soldiers collectively looting villages, attacking women, and shooting students, especially shooting a three-year-old child playing near an oil pipeline. The protest letter said that it was unprecedented in history for a toddler to be executed for a crime.

The South Korean cultural organization also stated in the protest letter that they would appeal to intellectuals around the world to oppose this slaughtering behavior by US soldiers. On October 1st, twelve organizations including the Japan-China Friendship Association held a grand meeting in Tokyo to celebrate the National Day of China.

    控告美空军蓄意杀人
    南朝鲜文化界愤怒抗议美军暴行
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本社会党和茨城县的工会7日联合向水户地方检察厅控告美国空军驾驶员戈登蓄意杀害日本老妇北条春。
    戈登在8月2日驾驶一架飞机从水户美军基地起飞，飞机在茨城县那珂凑市附近突然低飞，因此撞死了北条春，并且撞伤了她的儿子。美军当局在事后辩解说，戈登的飞机低飞是因为当时条件恶劣。
    由日本社会党国会议员细田纲吉和茨城县工会代表提交水户地方检察厅的控诉书驳斥说，飞机的低飞并不是由于当时条件恶劣，而是驾驶员戈登蓄意杀人。控诉书说，这种行为并不属于执行公务的范围，因此日本有权审理戈登。
    那珂凑市议会曾经在8月15日通过决议，要求日本国会向美国政府彻底追究撞死北条春事件的责任。
    新华社平壤9日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜全国文化团体总联合会10月8日起草了一项抗议书，向美国第八军军长德克尔强烈抗议美国兵不断杀害南朝鲜人民的暴行。
    抗议书说，他们对于美国兵集体劫掠村庄、袭击妇女、枪杀学生，特别是枪杀在输油管附近玩耍的三岁小孩等暴行不能不感到愤怒。抗议书说，幼儿由于犯罪而被枪毙也是史无前例的。
    南朝鲜的这个文化组织还在抗议书中表示，他们要呼吁全世界的知识分子反对美国兵的这种残杀行为。10月1日，日本日中友好协会等十二个团体，在东京举行庆祝中国国庆节大会。
