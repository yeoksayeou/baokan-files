Xinhua News Agency, Brighton, 13th: The British Conservative Party's annual meeting concluded here on the 12th.

Conservative Party leaders at the meeting did their utmost to defend their domestic and foreign policies. The main theme of their speeches was to adhere to these policies, "cooperate" with the United States internationally to oppose the Soviet Union, and take tougher measures domestically to deal with the working people.

Without serious discussion, the meeting expressed support for all the government's financial measures. Party Chairman Lord Hailsham, in a major policy speech, accused trade union leaders of "undermining our economic policies with irresponsible wage demands." Chancellor of the Exchequer Thorneycroft and other government leaders argued that "drastic and unpopular measures" were necessary, including cuts in investment and welfare funds.

A resolution was also passed at the closing meeting which, in effect, called on the government to take stronger measures to economically enslave those countries that had struggled to free themselves from the shackles of British colonialism.

Conservative Party leader and British Prime Minister Macmillan delivered a speech at a mass rally held after the meeting concluded today, in which he launched a crude attack on the Soviet Union and the Communist Party. He emphasized that Britain must "strive to act jointly" with the United States and stated that Britain was not prepared to abandon nuclear weapons as a "deterrent." He said that despite pressure from many sides of public opinion, Britain would not abandon the manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons.

　　英国保守党坚持反动政策
    年会在反苏反共反人民的叫嚣中闭幕
    据新华社布莱顿13日电　英国保守党年会12日在这里闭幕。
    保守党领袖们在会上竭力为他们的国内外政策辩护。他们演说的主调是，要坚持这种政策，在国际上同美国“合作”来反对苏联，在国内采取更强硬的措施来对付劳动人民。
    会议没有经过认真讨论就表示支持政府的一切财政措施。党的主席黑尔什姆爵士在主要政策演说中指责工会领袖“以不负责任的工资要求来破坏我们的经济政策”。财政大臣桑尼克罗夫特和其他政府领袖认为必须采取“严厉的和不受人欢迎的措施”，其中包括削减投资和福利基金。
    在闭幕会议上还通过了一项决议，实际上要求政府采取更有力的办法，以便在经济上奴役那些经过斗争而挣脱英国殖民主义枷锁的国家。
    保守党领袖、英国首相麦克米伦今天在会议结束后举行的群众大会上发表演说，对苏联和共产党进行了粗暴的攻击。他强调英国必须同美国“努力共同行动”，并且表示英国不准备放弃核武器作为一种“威慑力量”。他说，虽然受到许多方面舆论的压力，英国不放弃制造和试验核武器。
