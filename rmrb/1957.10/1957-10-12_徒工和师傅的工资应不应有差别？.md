　　Should There Be a Difference in Wages Between Apprentices and Masters?
    Same Tasks for Masters and Apprentices, Why Different Wages?
    In April, when the apprentices became full-fledged workers, we were rated as third-grade technicians. However, after the second evaluation, it remained unchanged. Is this reasonable?
    Now, the vast majority of products produced in our factory are produced by young apprentices. The tasks of the master and the young apprentices are the same. What is the difference between apprentices and masters? But the wages are vastly different. Why is this?

　　Apprentices' Contributions Cannot Be Compared With Masters'
    Last night we held a debate on the apprentice issue. The comrades who spoke at the meeting unanimously refuted the erroneous ideas of some apprentices. Wang Suzhen said: The fact that the master unreservedly teaches his skills to the apprentice is the master's contribution. The apprentice's work includes the master's achievements. How can you say that the master and the apprentice contribute the same? Xu Yi said: It is not right to say that the majority of products are produced by apprentices. We have the leadership of the factory administration, the help of Soviet experts, existing equipment, comrades who have returned from internships in the Soviet Union, technicians and process documents. Without these, what could apprentices produce? Tong Shuqin said: In the past, there were more masters in the Eleventh Workshop, so there were fewer defective products. But later, there were fewer masters, and apprentices replaced their work, and more defective products were produced than in the past. Zhang Lirong said: The masters have been working for more than ten years, and they are still fourth or fifth-grade workers. They do not feel that the grade is too low or the wages are too low. But the apprentices start to complain about wages soon after they arrive. They have not mastered the technology well, and they become proud, thinking that they are almost as good as the masters. What kind of thinking is this?

    Apprentices Should Not Be Arrogant
    Our factory is a new factory, and there are many apprentices who are making rapid progress. This is a fact. But think about it, can you master the technology without the training of the masters? You say that the majority of products in our factory are produced by apprentices, so please tell me, who designed the electron tube, and who led our factory to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule? When problems arise in production, who solves them? If there were no leaders, masters, and technicians, could you complete the production tasks? Don't become arrogant after knowing a little bit about production.

### 徒工和师傅的工资应不应有差别？

　　徒工和师傅的工资应不应有差别？
    师徒任务一样，工资何分高低
    4月份，徒工转正时，我们被评为三级技工，可是经过第二次评级，仍原封未动，这合理吗？
    现在，我们出厂的产品绝大部分是小徒工生产的，老师傅和小徒工的任务是一样的。徒工和老师傅有什么差别呢？但工资就大有高低。这是为什么呢？

　　徒工贡献不能同师傅比
    昨晚我们召开了关于徒工问题的辩论会，会上发言的同志，一致驳斥了部分徒工的错误思想。王素珍说：老师傅毫不保留的把自己的技术教给徒工，就是老师傅的功劳。在徒工工作中，就包含着老师傅的成绩，怎能说老师傅和徒工贡献一样大？许漪说：说产品绝大部分是徒工生产出来的是不对的。我们有厂行政的领导，有苏联专家的帮助，有现存设备，有到苏联实习回来的同志，有技术人员和工艺文件，没有这些，徒工能生产出什么来呢？佟淑勤说：以前十一号车间老师傅多，因此废品很少，但以后老师傅少了，多由徒工来代替他们的工作，废品出得比过去多了。张礼荣说：老师傅工作十几年了，还是四、五级工，他们并没感到等级太低，工资少。可是徒工来了不久就闹工资，还没有掌握好技术，就骄傲起来，认为自己和老师傅差不多了，这算什么思想？

    徒工不要目空一切
    我们厂是新厂，徒工多，进步快，这是事实。但是要想一想，没有老师傅的培养，你能掌握技术吗？你说我厂产品绝大部分是徒工生产出来的，那么请问，电子管是谁设计出来的，我厂提前完成第一个五年计划是谁领导的呢？当生产上出了问题，又是谁来解决的呢？假如没有领导和老师傅、技术员，你能完成生产任务吗？不要在生产上知道了点皮毛，就目空一切。
