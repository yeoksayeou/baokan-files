    Gold Panning is Bustling on the Banks of the Jinsha River
    (Our report) The Xichang and Ya'an Special Districts of Sichuan Province, known as "the Land of Gold," will produce 880 taels of placer gold and lode gold this year.
    Since August, under the leadership of the local Party committees and government industrial departments, a mass movement of prospecting and gold mining has been launched. On the banks of the Jinsha and Dadu Rivers, at the foot of the Jiajin and Ma'an Mountains, people have found many gold mines. In Yanbian, Huili, Jinkuang and other counties in the Xichang Special District, according to incomplete statistics, a total of 13 placer gold mines and 10 lode gold mines have been found. At present, various localities are actively arranging labor to organize gold mining teams in order to increase gold production without affecting agricultural production.

    金沙江畔采金忙
    本报讯　被称为“黄金之乡”的四川省西昌和雅安两个专区，今年将生产沙金和脉金八百八十两。
    从8月份以来，在当地党委和政府工业部门的领导下，一个探金、采金的群众运动开展起来了。在金沙江和大渡河河岸，在夹金山和马鞍山脚下，人们找出了许多金矿。在西昌专区的盐边、会理、金矿等县，据不完全统计，一共找到沙金矿十三处，脉金矿十处。现在各地正积极安排劳动力组织采金队伍，以便在不影响农业生产的前提下，增产黄金。
