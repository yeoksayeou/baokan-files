Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 12th. The monument to the Russian poet Pushkin, built in Shanghai in 1937, has been around for a full twenty years this year. Now, even on an ordinary day, people are placing flowers in front of the monument.

　　The monument stands in the center of a beautiful street garden, with a bronze bust of the poet placed on a beige granite base. The monument was first built in 1937 to commemorate the centenary of Pushkin's death. In 1944, the bronze statue was stolen by the Japanese invaders who occupied Shanghai at the time, and it was rebuilt in 1947.

　　Throughout the period of the Kuomintang reactionaries and Japanese invaders ruling Shanghai, many progressive writers and young people in Shanghai often came here to pay their respects and offer flowers. Some people even called it "Poet's Corner." This monument is particularly significant because Pushkin once mentioned in a letter his hope to travel to China.

　　After the liberation of Shanghai, the monument was properly managed by the People's Government, and green grass was laid around it. Young Pioneers often come here to hold team day activities and recite Pushkin's poems at the foot of the monument. Many Soviet friends who come to visit Shanghai also make a special trip to offer flowers and take photos here. On February 10th this year, the 120th anniversary of Pushkin's death, writers Ba Jin, Jin Yi, Tang Tao, and others all came to pay their respects to the bronze statue.

　　上海人民景仰普希金
    新华社上海12日电　1937年在上海建立的俄国诗人普希金的纪念碑，到今年已经整整二十周年。现在，在一个普通的日子里，纪念碑前也有人放着鲜花。
    纪念碑矗立在一个优美的街心花园的中央，米色的花岗石碑座上安置着诗人的铜雕胸像。纪念碑初建于1937年纪念普希金逝世一百周年时，1944年铜像为当时侵占上海的日本侵略者盗去，1947年重建。
    在整个国民党反动派和日本侵略者统治上海的时期内，上海的许多进步作家和青年，经常到这里来瞻仰和献花，有的人还把这里称为“诗人角”。这个纪念碑之所以特别有意义，还因为普希金在一封信中，曾经提到过希望来中国旅行。
    上海解放以后，纪念碑由人民政府妥善管理，四周还铺上了绿草。少先队员们经常前来举行队日活动，在纪念碑下朗诵普希金的诗歌。很多到上海来访问的苏联朋友，也专门到这里来献花和摄影。今年2月10日纪念普希金逝世一百二十周年时，作家巴金、靳以、唐弢等都到铜像前瞻仰致敬。
