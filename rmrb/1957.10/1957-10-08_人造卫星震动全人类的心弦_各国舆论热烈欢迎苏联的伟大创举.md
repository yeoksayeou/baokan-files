Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to reports from various countries, world opinion continues to cheer the Soviet Union's successful launch of the first artificial satellite. It is considered not only a huge scientific achievement for the Soviet Union, but also a huge political achievement. Many Asian and African newspapers have particularly emphasized that the Soviet Union's great achievement is a major blow to the aggressive forces of the United States.

    Warsaw's "People's Tribune" published a commentary on the 6th entitled "The Era of Conquering the Universe," saying that the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial Earth satellite has aroused great interest in countries around the world. Indeed, this is the first step in human history towards interstellar space. This incident shows that the Soviet Union has achieved another great victory in the competition with the United States.

    Prague's "Red Rights" published a large-character headline, "All Progressive Mankind is Elated by the Great Achievements of Socialist Science," reporting on the Soviet scientists' launch of the artificial Earth satellite.

    Iří Mráček, director of the Czechoslovak International Geophysical Year Signal Station, said that the day the Soviet Union launched the first artificial Earth satellite (October 4) was the beginning of a new era in human history.

    Pavlov, President of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, pointed out that the most advanced Soviet scientists in the world have made great contributions to science. He said that only socialist countries can continuously achieve brilliant achievements in economic, cultural, and scientific fields at such a rapid pace.

    Sofia's "Fatherland Front" pointed out that the Soviet Union built the world's first atomic power plant, the first jet passenger plane, the first intercontinental ballistic missile, and the first artificial Earth satellite—all of which are clear proof of the unparalleled superiority of scientific thought in socialist countries.

    Pyongyang's "Democratic Korea" published a commentary on the 7th saying that the Soviet Union's successful launch of an artificial satellite and the successful testing of intercontinental missiles not long ago confirmed that Soviet science and technology are far ahead of the United States. The Soviet Union's achievement is also a fatal blow to the war-mongers headed by US imperialism.

    Major newspapers in New Delhi published editorials on the 7th, praising the Soviet Union's successful launch of the artificial Earth satellite as an "epoch-making initiative." The newspapers pointed out that this action has opened up an entirely new field of human experience and knowledge. The "Hindustan Times" called for international cooperation to study methods for mankind to enter outer space, "without being hindered by Cold War attitudes and prejudices."

    Jakarta's "People's Daily" said in its editorial on the 7th that the successful launch of an artificial satellite by Soviet scientists has not only opened a new era in science, but also a new era in the issue of war and peace. The newspaper pointed out that this will force aggressors to consider more before launching a war.

    All Japanese newspapers emphasized in their editorials the great significance of the Soviet Union launching the world's first artificial satellite. "Mainichi Shimbun" said that this event has opened a new era for scientific development. "Asahi Shimbun" congratulated the Soviet scientists on their great victory and published many talks by famous Japanese scientists to the editorial department of the newspaper on the scientific and cultural significance of the Soviet scientists launching the artificial Earth satellite under the title "The First Step on the Road to Interstellar Flight."

    Many newspapers in Cairo hailed this event as not only an achievement of the Soviet Union in science and technology, but also a huge political achievement. The "Al-Ahram" published an editorial saying that the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial satellite is an "amazing achievement, almost a true miracle." The "Republic" pointed out that the Soviet Union's achievement has great international significance. The newspaper believes: "The Soviet Union has achieved a major victory in the struggle for peace."

    Damascus' "Al-Nour," "Al-Rai Al-Aam," "Al-Nasr," and "Al-Jamahir" published editorials expressing their conviction that the Soviet Union will use all its possibilities to seek world peace. "Al-Nour" said that peace-loving people welcome the major news of the Soviet Union creating an artificial satellite. This new victory in science by the Soviet Union is an extremely serious warning to US imperialism and its agents.

    On the 6th, British newspapers all published news of the brilliant achievements of Soviet science on the front page. The newspaper headlines were: "Moscow is talking to Manchester," "The whole world is listening to the satellite." Most newspapers and science commentators believe that launching a satellite is an extremely important event, a practical step on the road to conquering interstellar space. The "Sunday Express" wrote in its editorial: "The Russians have effectively shown the world the genius and wisdom of their scientists and technicians."

    Many French newspapers pointed out that the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial satellite has caused "confusion" and "panic" among some Americans, and this event is a blow to American "prestige." The newspapers wrote that American science and technology lag behind the Soviet Union in many major issues, which makes "American military experts feel even more uneasy."

    The West German Social Democratic Party's "Social Democratic News Bulletin" published an article on the 6th saying that the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite in human history is the Soviet Union's greatest victory in the peace race. The news bulletin believes that the Soviet Union's tremendous achievements in science and technology are inseparable from the "tremendous changes that have taken place in Russia in the last forty years."

    In Italy, the attention of the scientific community and the entire public opinion has also been focused on the artificial Earth satellite launched by the Soviet Union since the 5th. "Unità" wrote in an editorial that the Soviet scientists who launched the artificial satellite not only won a victory in the race with nature, but also struck a blow to those who hope that mankind will regress and promote the idea that humans are incapable. ANSA broadcast a bulletin issued by the Loziano Observatory of the University of Bologna saying, "The day of the launch of the first artificial satellite will be eternally recorded in the history of mankind and science. It marks the beginning of the practical stage of conquering the universe."

    The headlines of Viennese newspapers were: "The victory of the idea of serving mankind's peaceful cause," "The Russians launched an artificial moon into the universe," "The first step in conquering interstellar space." The "New Austrian Daily" wrote in an editorial: "The two major powers have been designing space rockets for a long time. The Russians have become the undeniable victors. It must be concluded from this that the nonsense about Russian technical backwardness has completely gone bankrupt."

    In Finland, news of the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial Earth satellite became the main news in Finnish newspapers. The headline of "Uusi Suomi" was: "The Russian artificial moon hangs high above the United States." "Sosialidemokraatti" emphasized that "the Soviet artificial satellite has shaken the globe."

    The American public and newspapers continue to praise the Soviet Union's achievement in launching the first artificial satellite.

    Dr. Bronk, President of the American Academy of Sciences, said: "Scientists are naturally proud of being the first to achieve success. We American scientists are happy for the Russian scientific achievements. We welcome their achievements."

    The "New York Times" wrote on the 6th, "It is now clear that October 4, 1957 will be forever recorded in history as one of mankind's greatest achievements. What was recently only a theoretical exploration in science fiction books has now become a reality."

    The newspaper said: "Every great achievement in modern science opens up two paths for mankind. One is a hopeful and promising path, which can be taken as long as citizens of all countries and different beliefs work together for the benefit of mankind. The other is a path of despair and disaster. If the great achievements of world science are used for aggression, death, and destruction, mankind may embark on this path."

    The "New York Herald Tribune" correspondent in Washington wrote: Washington's reaction to the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial satellite is to sadly conclude that the United States has failed in the era-defining competition of the twentieth century. The Soviet artificial satellite will fly over America's sorrowful capital.
