Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th -- Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, today wrote to Mr. Mongro, President of the current United Nations General Assembly, and Mr. Hammarskjöld, Secretary-General of the United Nations, accusing the United Nations General Assembly plenary session of passing an unjust resolution on October 25th considering South Korea eligible to be a member of the United Nations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Korea today sent copies of this letter to reporters.

Nam Il said in the letter that if South Korea is unilaterally admitted to the United Nations, it will permanently divide Korea, which should be unified. The letter said that the current Korean issue is not a matter of illegally admitting a part of Korea into the United Nations, but of peacefully unifying the divided two parts on a democratic basis. Accordingly, the United Nations Security Council once again rejected the issue of unilaterally admitting South Korea to the United Nations on September 9th this year. However, the representatives of some member states of the United Nations continue to stubbornly insist on unilaterally admitting South Korea to the United Nations, which is an extremely contradictory practice, especially because of the instigation of the United States, which encourages and promotes this behavior, which is even more intolerable. This phenomenon not only further damages the prestige of the United Nations, but also makes the United Nations deviate from its purpose and principles.

The letter said that the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the United Nations General Assembly’s resolution on October 25th regarding the recognition of the Lee Seung-man regime as eligible to unilaterally join the United Nations can only create obstacles to the resolution of the Korean issue. The Government of the Republic believes that convening a conference of relevant countries with representatives from North and South Korea will help to fairly resolve the Korean issue.

### 南日函联大主席和秘书长指责让南朝鲜加入联合国

    南日函联大主席和秘书长
    指责让南朝鲜加入联合国
    据新华社平壤29日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日今天写信给本届联合国大会主席孟罗和联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，指责联合国大会全体会议在10月25日通过的认为南朝鲜有资格为联合国会员国的决议是不正当的。朝鲜外务省今天把这封信的副本发给了记者。
    南日在信中说，如果让南朝鲜单方面加入联合国，将使应该统一起来的朝鲜永久分裂下去。这封信说，今天的朝鲜问题不是非法地使朝鲜的一部分加入联合国的问题，而是在民主的基础上和平统一被分裂的两个部分的问题。据此，今年9月9日联合国安全理事会曾经再一次否决了使南朝鲜单方面加入联合国的问题。但是，联合国的一部分会员国代表，却继续顽固地坚持使南朝鲜单方面加入联合国，这是极为矛盾的作法，特别是由于美国的唆使，使这种行为得到鼓励和推动，这更是令人不能容忍。这种现象，不仅使联合国的威信进一步受到损害，而且使联合国离开它的宗旨和原则。
    这封信说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为，联合国大会全体会议10月25日关于承认李承晚政权有资格单方面加入联合国的决议只能对朝鲜问题的解决造成障碍。共和国政府认为，召开有南北朝鲜代表参加的有关国家会议是有助于公正解决朝鲜问题的。
