    Preparing for Socialist Debates in Minority Areas
    Eshan Yi Autonomous County Trains Cadres
    (Our Dispatch from Eshan, October 28th) The Eshan Yi Autonomous County in Yunnan Province has convened another three-level cadre meeting, combining the spirit of the "Third Plenary Session" to train cadres and prepare for the socialist debates that will soon unfold in minority areas.
    Recently, the large-scale airing of views (大鸣大放) has basically concluded in over one hundred agricultural cooperatives in the forty-seven townships of Eshan County. As the transition to large-scale debate approaches, a widespread fear of difficulty has emerged among grassroots cadres. They are unable to clearly distinguish class boundaries regarding the erroneous statements made by well-to-do middle peasants and a few backward farmers during the airing of views. They do not understand how to organize people of all ethnic groups to conduct large-scale debates on the basis of the airing of views. Some cadres are waiting for instructions from higher authorities, while others have abandoned leadership altogether, leading to chaotic labor order in a few agricultural cooperatives, stalled autumn harvests, and some well-to-do middle peasants stirring up trouble and attacking cadres.
    In response to the above situation, the Eshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a three-level cadre meeting. The meeting first trained cadres to be adept at analyzing the opinions expressed by people of all ethnic groups during the airing of views, distinguishing which are beneficial to socialism and which are detrimental. What are the goals of the well-to-do middle peasants in voicing their opinions? What are the goals of the lower-middle peasants and poor peasants? During the discussions, methods such as accounting and recalling comparisons were used to present facts and reason things out, using concrete facts to refute the anti-socialist statements of the well-to-do middle peasants.
    The meeting emphasized that special attention should be paid to ethnic characteristics in the large-scale debates, and the significance of the debates should be repeatedly explained to the farmers of all ethnic groups. Based on the increased ideological awareness of the farmers of all ethnic groups, the capitalist ideas of the well-to-do middle peasants should be criticized. Whether to criticize by name or not during the criticism depends on the specific target and the level of mass awareness. In areas with a better foundation, criticism by name can be carried out. In mountainous areas with a weaker foundation, a method of proactively conducting self-criticism and collective criticism can be adopted to achieve the goal of common improvement and clarifying major issues of right and wrong. The meeting believed that the methods can be diverse, but not equivalent to "going through the motions." At the meeting, townships such as Dabaiyi, Huanian, Tadian, Youyi, and Shiyi also shared their experiences in refuting the well-to-do middle peasants, which enhanced the confidence of cadres in carrying out the debates.

### 迎接少数民族地区的社会主义大辩论  峨山彝族自治县训练干部

    迎接少数民族地区的社会主义大辩论
    峨山彝族自治县训练干部
    本报峨山28日电　云南峨山彝族自治县再次召开三级干部会议，结合“三中全会”的精神，训练干部，准备迎接即将在少数民族地区展开的社会主义大辩论。
    最近，峨山县四十七个乡的一百多个农业社大鸣大放已经基本结束。在将要转入大辩论的时候，基层干部中普遍发生畏难情绪，对富裕中农及少数落后农民在鸣放中放出来的错误言论，划不清阶级界限；不懂得应该怎样去组织各族人民在大鸣大放的基础上开展大辩论，有些干部就等待上级给办法，有的就放弃了领导，以致少数农业社发生劳动秩序混乱，秋收生产推不动，个别富裕中农还兴风作浪，打击干部。
    中共峨山县委会针对上述情况，召开了三级干部会议。会议首先训练干部要善于分析各族人民在鸣放中放出来的意见，哪些是有利于社会主义的，哪些是不利于社会主义的；富裕中农放出来的目的是什么？下中农、贫农放出来的目的是什么？在讨论时，采用算账，回忆对比等方法，摆事实讲道理。用具体事实驳倒富裕中农反社会主义的言论。
    会议强调在大辩论中要特别注意民族特点，要向各族农民反复讲明大辩论的意义。在各族农民思想觉悟有了提高的基础上，将富裕中农的资本主义思想进行批判。在批判时，指名批判好还是不指名好，要看具体对象和群众觉悟程度。在基础较好的地区，可以指名批判，在基础较差的山区可以采取主动检讨，大家批判的办法，达到共同提高，划清大是大非的目的。会议认为方式可以多种多样，但不等于“走过场”。会上，大白邑、化念、塔甸、由义、石邑等乡，还交流了他们怎样驳倒富裕中农的经验，增强了干部开展辩论的信心。
