Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th (TASS dispatch): Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, requesting an emergency meeting of the General Committee to discuss including a new item proposed by the Syrian delegation – "Complaint Against Threats to the Security of Syria and International Peace" – on the agenda of the UN General Assembly.

The letter was accompanied by a memorandum. The memorandum clarified the reasons for the Syrian government's appeal to the United Nations.

The memorandum stated that foreign actions infringing upon Syria and threatening Syria's security and independence, as well as world peace, have continued for more than a year. These actions have intensified in the last two months, especially in the last two weeks.

Now, due to Turkey's unwarranted and unprecedented large-scale deployment of several divisions of troops directly near the Syrian-Turkish border, there is a real threat of war against Syria. These troops are constantly being reinforced. Currently, these troops are mainly concentrated in a small area, occupying positions that foreshadow an imminent attack.

The memorandum continued by pointing out that provocative actions occur constantly. Foreign military aircraft have repeatedly flown over Syrian airspace near the Turkish-Syrian border and over Syrian coastal areas, thus violating Syrian airspace. Armed attacks on Syrian territory from Turkey, border conflicts and shootings, and other such actions occur frequently.

Military pressure on Syria and threats to Syria's security are related to other actions, such as interference in Syria's internal affairs. The purpose of interfering in Syria's internal affairs is to attempt to change Syria's policies or overthrow its government. Such actions by foreigners are still ongoing.

One such conspiracy has already been exposed. Later, another conspiracy to overthrow the Syrian government by violence was uncovered. Some of the criminals in these conspiracy cases escaped. They somehow fled to Turkey and gathered there. They are actively engaged in activities there, attempting to overthrow the Syrian government with foreign assistance and establish a Syrian government that follows the policies of certain Western countries.

A few days ago, a large number of concealed weapons were seized. These weapons were smuggled into Syria, intended for violent actions against Syria and its government.

In addition to the above, foreign countries are also exerting other forms of pressure on the Syrian people and government, attempting to create conditions that could cause internal chaos and international conflict. In addition to political pressure, a propaganda offensive is being waged, attempting to incite hostility towards Syria and prepare the ground for adventurous actions against Syria.

The memorandum emphasized that it is very clear that a threat to Syria's security and independence has formed. The current situation has indeed reached the point where the United Nations must take necessary measures in accordance with its Charter. Serious international friction has occurred. We are convinced that once war breaks out in the Middle East, it will inevitably cause widespread international disputes. The current situation does threaten world peace...

The memorandum concluded by saying that despite various diplomatic and other efforts, the situation has continued to deteriorate rapidly in recent days, although the situation has not yet become irreparably dangerous.

In this situation, the Syrian delegation believes that it is necessary for the United Nations General Assembly to promptly study the issue it has raised and take the measures required by the United Nations Charter.

The Syrian delegation believes that it would be appropriate for the United Nations General Assembly to establish a committee responsible for investigating the situation on the Syrian-Turkish border and reporting to the General Assembly. Such an impartial international investigation would undoubtedly help the United Nations understand the facts.

The Syrian government suggests that this issue be put on the agenda in the spirit of responsibility to its own people and the world public. What Syria seeks is simply to live safely in peace and in cooperation with other countries in the spirit of the United Nations Charter.

　　叙利亚安全和国际和平面临威胁
    叙外长要求联大主持正义
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社纽约16日讯：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德一封信，要求召开总务委员会紧急会议，讨论把叙利亚代表团提出的一个新的项目——“对威胁叙利亚的安全和国际和平的控诉案”列入联大议程。
    信中附有备忘录一份。备忘录阐明了叙利亚政府向联合国呼吁的理由。
    备忘录中说，外国侵犯叙利亚并使叙利亚的安全和独立以及世界和平遭到威胁的行动，已经继续了一年多。最近两个月，特别是最近两周，这种行动变本加厉了。
    现在，由于土耳其把几师的兵力向直接靠近叙利亚和土耳其的边界无端地、空前地大力集结，所以对叙利亚存在着实际的战争威胁。这些军队还不断得到增援。现在，这些军队主要集中在一个不很大的地段上，占据着预示最近就要进攻的阵地。
    备忘录接着指出，挑衅性的行动不断发生。外国军用飞机不止一次地在靠近土耳其的叙利亚疆界上和叙利亚沿海地区上空飞行，这就侵犯了叙利亚的领空。土耳其向叙利亚境内的武装袭击，边界上的冲突和射击以及其他诸如此类的行动经常发生。
      对叙利亚的军事压力和对叙利亚安全的威胁是同其他行动有关的，例如，同对叙利亚内政的干涉是有关的，对叙利亚内政的干涉，
  目的是企图改变叙利亚的政策或者推翻它的政府。外国人的这种行动还在继续进行。
    有一个这样的阴谋已经揭露。后来又揭露了一个企图以暴力推翻叙利亚政府的阴谋案。这些阴谋案中的某些罪犯漏网了。他们用某种方法逃往土耳其集合。他们在那里积极进行活动，企图借外国的帮助来推翻叙利亚政府，建立一个追随某些西方国家政策的叙利亚政府。
    几天以前，曾经破获大批暗藏的武器。这批武器是私运到叙利亚的，准备用来对叙利亚及其政府采取暴力行动。
    除了上述情况外，外国还对叙利亚人民和政府采取其他形式的压力，企图创造可以引起内部混乱和国际冲突的条件。除了政治压力外，还进行宣传攻势，企图煽起对叙利亚的敌视态度并为对叙利亚的冒险行动准备土壤。
    备忘录中强调指出，十分明显，对叙利亚安全和独立的威胁已经形成。目前的情况的确已经达到了联合国必须根据它的宪章采取必要措施的地步。严重的国际磨擦已经发生。我们确信，一旦在中东爆发战争，必然会引起广泛的国际纠纷。当前的局势确实威胁着世界和平……
    备忘录最后说，尽管在外交方面和其他方面作了种种努力，这种局势在最近几天当中仍旧继续迅速恶化，虽然情势还没有危险到不可收拾的地步。
    在这种情况下，叙利亚代表团认为联合国大会有必要火速研究所提出的问题，并采取联合国宪章所要求的措施。
    叙利亚代表团认为，联合国大会成立一个委员会负责调查叙土边境情况并向大会提出报告是适宜的。这种无偏私的国际调查无疑地会有助于联合国了解事实。
    叙利亚政府建议把这个问题列入议程，是本着对本国人民和世界公众负责的精神。叙利亚所争取的只是在和平和本着联合国宪章精神同其他国家合作的情况下安全地生活。
