Beijing Nine Universities and Colleges Hold Track and Field Meet
    National Track and Field Team Invited to Perform

    (Our Newspaper) In response to the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission's call to widely develop mass sports activities, nine universities and colleges in the northern suburbs of Beijing held a track and field meet on the 27th. Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology won first place in the overall team score.

    This sports meet has been held annually since 1955. The sports meet has a silver "circulation cup" that is awarded to the school that wins first place in the overall team score each time. If a unit wins three consecutive victories, the silver cup will no longer circulate and will belong to them forever.

    A total of more than 500 athletes participated in this sports meet, competing in 32 events. Gao Zhengquan, a student from the Institute of Geology and Exploration, achieved a time of 11 seconds in the 100 meters, which is currently the highest level in our country.

    Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology is the winner of the overall team score for three consecutive years, so they permanently obtained the silver cup that symbolizes health and victory.

    Higher education institutions in the western and urban districts of Beijing have also held sports meets of this nature, but they have not persisted.

    At the sports meet, the National Track and Field Team was invited to perform. During the performance, four athletes broke four national records, but none of them broke the new achievements created at the 1957 National Track and Field Meet held in Nanjing not long ago. (Shi Yuzhong)

    北京九院校举行田径运动会
    国家田径代表队应邀参加表演
    本报讯　响应国家体委广泛开展群众性体育活动的号召，北京北郊九个高等院、校27日举行了田径运动大会。北京钢铁学院获得团体总分第一名。
    这个运动会从1955年起，每年举行一次。运动会有一只银质“循环杯”，奖给每次获得团体总分第一的学校，如果某单位连获三年胜利，银杯就不再循环，永远属于他们。
    参加这次运动会的共有五百多名运动员，比赛了三十二个项目。地质勘探学院学生高正铨的一百公尺成绩达到十一秒，是目前我国的最高水平。
    北京钢铁学院是连续三年团体总分的胜利者，因此他们永远地得到了那只标志健康和胜利的银杯。
    像这样性质的运动会，北京西郊区、城市区的高等院、校也曾举办过，但是没有坚持下来。
    在运动会上，国家田径代表队应邀作了表演。在表演中，有四名运动员打破了四项全国最高纪录，但都没有突破不久前在南京举行的1957年全国田径运动会上所创造的新成绩。　（施毓忠）
