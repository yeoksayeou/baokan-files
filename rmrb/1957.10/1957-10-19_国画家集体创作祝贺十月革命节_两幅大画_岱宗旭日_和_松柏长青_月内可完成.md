To Celebrate the October Revolution Anniversary, National Painters Collaboratively Create Works
Two Large Paintings "Sunrise at Mount Tai" and "Evergreen Pine and Cypress" to be Completed Within the Month

(Our newspaper’s report) To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, Beijing national painters Chen Banding, Yu Fei'an, Tian Shiguang, Hu Peheng, Wu Jingting and 14 others are stepping up their efforts to create two large paintings. These two large paintings, nine feet high and eighteen feet wide, take the form of six through-view large screens. One is a landscape painting, entitled "Sunrise at Mount Tai," which symbolizes that the victory of the October Socialist Revolution has brought infinitely beautiful communist prospects to the progress of all human history; the other is a flower-and-bird painting, entitled "Evergreen Pine and Cypress," whose theme is to symbolize the splendid glory and eternal youth of the communist cause with pine, cypress, cranes, flowers and birds.

Because the painters have improved their ideological awareness during the rectification movement, they can all offer opinions to each other during the creation process, give play to their expertise and the spirit of collective cooperation, so the theme of the pictures is prominent and the style tends to be consistent.

The painters are now busy coloring and processing, and it is expected that all of them can be completed before the end of the month.

　　国画家集体创作祝贺十月革命节
    两幅大画“岱宗旭日”和“松柏长青”月内可完成
    本报讯  为了庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念，北京国画家陈半丁、于非闇、田世光、胡佩衡、吴镜汀等十九人正在加紧创作两幅大画。这两幅高九尺、宽十八尺的大画，采取了六条通景大屏的形式。一幅是山水画，题名“岱宗旭日”，它象征着十月社会主义革命的胜利在全人类历史的进程中带来了无限美好的共产主义前景；另一幅是花鸟画，题名“松柏长青”，其主题思想是以松柏仙鹤和花鸟象征着共产主义事业的灿烂辉煌，青春永驻。
    画家们由于在整风运动中提高了思想觉悟，在创作中均能相互提出意见，发挥专长和集体合作的精神，因此画面的主题突出、风格亦趋于一致。
    现在画家们忙于着色加工，预计月底前可全部完成。
