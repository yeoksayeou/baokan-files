Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd. The Shanghai people's rally to welcome the Bulgarian Government Delegation headed by Chairman Anton Yugov was held this morning at the Cultural Square. More than 7,000 people attended.

    Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, on behalf of all the people of Shanghai, expressed warm welcome and sincere respect to the distinguished Bulgarian guests from the glorious homeland of Dimitrov. He said that the people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, cherish with special respect the memory of the great leader of the Bulgarian people, the outstanding activist of the international workers' movement, and the close friend of the Chinese people—Comrade Dimitrov, who gave us strong support and encouragement. Cao Diqiu also described to the guests the achievements of Shanghai in various fields since liberation, and he particularly pointed out that these achievements are inseparable from the encouragement and support of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and other socialist brother countries. In conclusion, Cao Diqiu repeatedly asked the distinguished guests to convey the respect and greetings of the people of Shanghai to the people of Bulgaria.
    Gimitar Ganev, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Bulgarian National Assembly and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, then spoke amid thunderous applause. He praised the glorious fighting tradition of the Shanghai people. Ganev said that the fraternal feelings between our two peoples are embodied in the complete agreement during our talks with the leading comrades of China. This demonstrates the strength and power of Sino-Bulgarian friendship. Ganev said that when we saw everything in China and learned about the heavy legacy that New China inherited from the old system, we can say that the Chinese people have indeed performed miracles under the leadership of the Communist Party. He said: "When we see today that New China is advancing and becoming a powerful industrial country, when we see that the material and cultural level of the Chinese people is gradually improving, we believe that it is our duty to pay deep respect to the millions of known and unknown sons and daughters of the Chinese people who sacrificed their most precious thing—life—in the flames of many years of cruel struggle against the enemy, and sprinkled their blood all over the fields and mountains of China. The sacrificed heroes—the fighters who fought for the freedom of China and for the happiness of the Chinese people—will be immortal!"
    Ganev said that we have always had a deep respect and trust in the glorious Chinese Communist Party. Here in China, we have personally seen and deeply believe how enormous the appeal of the Chinese Communist Party is among the working people, and how successfully it leads socialist construction according to China's specific conditions. The Chinese Communist Party is waging an uncompromising struggle for the purity of Marxism-Leninism, for the victory of the unshakable principles of Marxism-Leninism, against all attempts to revise Marxism-Leninism, and against all kinds of nonsense about "national communism" and other similar things—the Leninist Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, whom we all respect, enjoys undeniable and growing prestige in the international communist and workers' movement because of its tenacious work and correct policies.
    Ganev said that we also feel the Chinese people's love for our common friend, the Soviet Union. On the issue of further consolidating the friendship between our two countries and the Soviet Union, we are also in complete agreement with our Chinese comrades. Because we clearly know that without the great October Socialist Revolution—which will soon celebrate its fortieth anniversary—and without the existence of a strong Soviet Union, we could not have gained freedom from dependence on imperialism, and we cannot now build our new life.
    Ganev said: In the talks, we and the Chinese comrades are also in complete agreement on the foreign policies of our two countries. Our common desire is to wage an unremitting struggle to maintain and consolidate peace. The socialist countries' policies aimed at consolidating peace, in fact, express the interests of all mankind. The whole world has seen how many significant and varied steps the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries have taken in recent years to ease international tensions and consolidate peace.
    Ganev said: "But we have seen that certain imperialist blocs, mainly the American imperialist bloc, are pursuing precisely the opposite policy. These imperialist blocs continue the arms race, continue and expand their military alliances and military bases distributed around the world. Recently, near the border of Bulgaria, in the Middle East, under the pressure of the United States, a series of events have occurred, with the United States threatening the Arab people with new enslavement, and which could easily turn into a huge conflict.
      "We have just returned from Korea. We felt from the leaders and all the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea how strong their desire for national reunification is and how indignant they are at the United States' policy of dividing Korea.
    "The despicable and shameless actions taken by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people, the most populous country on earth, will become a dark page in American history. U.S. imperialism continues to occupy China's Taiwan Province, supports the thoroughly corrupt Chiang Kai-shek clique there, and, at the instigation of the United States, China continues to be illegally excluded from the United Nations. The People's Republic of Bulgaria, together with other socialist and democratic countries, will do everything in its power to enable China to obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations. We firmly reject the fallacies about the existence of two Chinas.
    "There is only one China, that is, the People's Republic of China, and Taiwan is a province of China temporarily occupied by U.S. imperialism.
    "The entire policy of our two countries and other socialist countries is based on the need to consolidate peace and peacefully resolve all international disputes on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries with different social and political systems. But we are very familiar with the imperialists and know that they will take risks in desperation. That is why we do not relax the issue of consolidating the defense capabilities of our countries. We are fighting for peace not because we are weak, but because this peaceful policy is dictated by the very essence of the socialist system.
      "Until now, the imperialists have been intimidating and threatening the people with their imagined superiority in atomic and hydrogen weapons. With the recent TASS report on the testing of an ultra-long-range intercontinental multi-stage missile in the Soviet Union, the weapon in the hands of the imperialists used to threaten the people was finally shattered. This modern, sophisticated, and most powerful weapon will greatly contribute to sobering up some crazy heads in the imperialist aggressor groups, and ultimately is a contribution to the struggle to consolidate peace."
    Ganev said: "The main guarantee of our security and the security of the people of all countries is the unity of our powerful socialist camp with its population of 900 million. As long as we are united, we are an indestructible force, and we are not afraid of anything. Educated in the internationalist spirit of Georgi Dimitrov, we, the Communists of Bulgaria, cannot compromise with any attempt to undermine the unity of our camp and dissolve the ranks of our camp from anywhere. We attach great importance to the enormous contribution made by the People's Republic of China in consolidating the socialist camp.
    "Comrades, the Bulgarian people deeply respect the Chinese people's wisdom, humility, tenacity, and heroism. Our visit here has further strengthened our love for the Chinese people and our respect for the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Government."
    Ganev said: "We came here as friends of the Chinese people, and we will leave as close brothers of the Chinese people. We are about to return, but as our people say, we will leave our hearts here. On our part, we will do our best in the future to consolidate the fraternal friendship between our two peoples, a friendship that is strong because it is based on common goals and aspirations, a common path—the path of socialism for our two peoples and the struggle for peace among all countries, because this friendship is inspired by the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism."
    Ganev's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the crowd.
    The Bulgarian Government Delegation attended the meeting today accompanied by Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and Zeng Yongquan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. When the delegation entered the venue, the audience stood up and applauded warmly to express their welcome and respect.
    After the meeting, the delegation also watched acrobatics and dance performances.

    上海人民热烈欢迎保政府代表团
    加涅夫说我们要尽全力巩固两国人民的兄弟友谊
    新华社上海3日电  上海人民欢迎以安东·于哥夫主席为首的保加利亚政府代表团的大会，今天上午在文化广场举行。到会的群众有七千多人。
    上海市副市长曹荻秋在会上代表全上海人民向来自季米特洛夫的光荣祖国的保加利亚贵宾表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。他说，上海人民和全国人民一样，以特别尊敬的心情怀念着保加利亚人民伟大的领袖、国际工人运动杰出的活动家、中国人民亲密的朋友——季米特洛夫同志，他给了我们有力的支持和鼓舞。曹荻秋还向客人叙述了上海解放后各方面的建设成就，他特别指出：这些成就是和苏联、保加利亚及其他社会主义兄弟国家的鼓舞和支援分不开的。曹荻秋最后一再请贵宾们转达上海人民对保加利亚人民的敬意和问候。
    保加利亚国民议会外交委员会主席、保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记吉米特尔·加涅夫接着在雷鸣般的掌声中讲话。他称赞了上海人民光荣的斗争传统。加涅夫说，我们两国人民相互间的兄弟之情体现在我们同中国的领导同志会谈时的完全一致中。这说明了保中友好的坚强和力量。加涅夫说，当我们在中国看到了一切并且知道了新中国从旧制度接受的沉重遗产后，我们可以说，中国人民在共产党的领导下的确作出了奇迹。他说：“当我们今天看到新中国在前进和变成一个强大的工业国家的时候，当我们看到中国人民的物质和文化水平正在逐步提高的时候，我们认为向在同敌人进行多年的残酷斗争的烈火中牺牲了自己最宝贵的东西——生命，并且把自己的热血洒遍了中国的田野和山岭的千百万知名和不知名的中国人民的儿女致以深深的敬意，是我们的责任。牺牲的英雄们——为中国的自由，为中国人民的幸福而斗争的战士，永垂不朽！”
    加涅夫说，我们对光荣的中国共产党一向怀着深深的尊敬和信任的感情。我们在这里在中国亲自看到并且深信中国共产党在劳动人民中享有多么巨大的号召力，多么成功地根据中国的特有条件领导社会主义建设。中国共产党为马克思列宁主义的纯洁，为马列主义的不可动摇的原则的胜利，为反对各种修正马列主义的企图，为反对各种关于“民族共产主义”和其他类似的东西的胡言谰语而进行着毫不妥协的斗争——以我们大家所尊敬的毛泽东同志为首列宁式的中央委员会领导的中国共产党由于自己的顽强工作和正确的政策，在国际共产主义和工人运动中享有无可争辩的日益巨大的威信。
    加涅夫说，我们也感受到中国人民对我们共同的朋友苏联的热爱。在必须进一步巩固我们两国同苏联的友谊的问题上，我们同中国同志们也是完全一致的。因为我们清楚地知道，没有伟大的十月社会主义革命——最近就要庆祝它的四十年，没有强大苏联的存在，我们就不能从对帝国主义的依赖地位得到自由，现在就不能建设自己的新生活。
    加涅夫说：在会谈中，我们同中国同志们在我们两国的对外政策上也是完全一致的。我们为维护和巩固和平而进行不倦斗争的愿望是共同的。社会主义国家的旨在巩固和平的政策，事实上，表达了全人类的利益。全世界都看到，苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家，为了缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平，在最近几年中采取了多少重大的各种各样的步骤。
    加涅夫说：“但是我们看到了某些帝国主义集团主要是美帝国主义集团执行着的一个恰恰相反的政策。这些帝国主义集团继续进行军备竞赛，继续并且扩大自己的军事联盟和分布在全世界的军事基地。最近，靠近保加利亚的边境，在中近东，在美国的压力下，发生了一系列的事件，美国以新的奴役威胁着阿拉伯人民，并且能够很容易变成巨大的冲突。
      “我们刚刚从朝鲜回来。我们从朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领导人和全体人民那里感到他们要求统一国家的愿望是多么强烈和对美国分裂朝鲜的政策是多么愤慨。
    “美帝国主义对地球上人口最多的国家——中国人民所采取的卑鄙无耻的行动，将要成为美国历史上的黑暗的一页。美国帝国主义继续霸占中国的台湾省，支持那里的腐朽透顶的蒋介石集团，在美国的指使下，中国继续非法地被排除在联合国之外。保加利亚人民共和国同其他社会主义国家和民主国家一道，将要竭尽全力使中国能取得它在联合国的合法地位。我们坚决唾弃关于好像存在着两个中国的谰言。
    “中国只有一个，那就是中华人民共和国，而台湾是中国的暂时被美帝国主义侵占的一个省。
    “我们两国和其他社会主义国家的全部政策都是以巩固和平和在不同的社会和政治制度各国和平共处的五项原则的基础上，和平解决一切国际争端的必要性为出发点的。但是我们很熟悉帝国主义者，也知道他们在绝望中会进行冒险。这就是为什么我们不放松巩固我们国家的防御力量的问题。我们为和平而斗争并不是因为我们软弱，而是因为这种和平政策是由社会主义制度的实质本身所规定的。
      “直到现在，帝国主义者一直以他们想像出来的什么在原子和氢武器方面的优势来恐吓威胁人民。随着塔斯社不久以前的关于在苏联试验了超远程洲际多级导弹的报道，帝国主义者手中的用以威胁人民的武器最后地被粉碎了。这种现代的、完善的、最强大的武器将要在很大程度上有助于清醒帝国主义侵略集团中的某些发昏的脑袋，并且归根到底是对巩固和平的斗争的一个贡献。”
    加涅夫说：“我们的安全和世界各国人民的安全的主要保证，是我们强大的拥有九万万人口的社会主义阵营的团结。只要我们团结，我们就是不可摧毁的力量，我们就不怕任何东西。在格奥尔基·季米特洛夫国际主义精神的教育下，我们，保加利亚的共产党人，不能同来自任何地方的、破坏我们阵营的团结、涣散我们阵营的队伍的任何企图妥协。我们十分重视中华人民共和国在巩固社会主义阵营方面作出的最巨大贡献。
    “同志们，保加利亚人民十分尊敬中国人民的英明、谦虚、顽强和英勇。我们到这里来访问更加加强了我们对中国人民的热爱，对中国共产党和中国人民政府的尊敬。”
    加涅夫说：“我们来这里的时候是中国人民的朋友，我们走的时候就是中国人民的亲兄弟。我们就要回去了，但是正像我国人民所说的，我们将把心留在这里。在我们这方面，我们在将来还要尽全力巩固我们两国人民的兄弟友谊，这种友谊是坚强的，因为这种友谊的基础是共同的目标和愿望、共同的道路——我们两国人民的社会主义和为各国人民间的和平而斗争的道路，因为鼓舞这种友谊的是马列主义的不朽思想。”
    加涅夫的讲话一再为群众的热烈掌声所打断。
    保加利亚政府代表团今天是在上海市副市长曹荻秋、外交部副部长曾涌泉的陪同下来参加大会的。代表团进入会场时，全场起立热烈鼓掌，向他们表示欢迎和敬意。
    会后，代表团还观看了杂技和舞蹈表演。
