Leprosy is Preventable and Curable
	Zhang Zikuan
	For many years, leprosy has been regarded as an "incurable disease" among the masses. People would turn pale at the mention of leprosy, feeling anxious and tense. The reason why people are so afraid of leprosy and believe it is untreatable is not only because they do not understand the scientific knowledge and prevention methods related to leprosy, but also because they have witnessed or actually experienced the tragic encounters of leprosy patients under the reactionary rule. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government did not prevent or treat leprosy. They treated leprosy patients with inhumane methods such as shooting, burning, and burying alive. Chen Jitang in Guangdong, Ma Bufang in Qinghai, and Zhang Zongchang in Shandong had all massacred large numbers of leprosy patients in batches or collectively. Before liberation, in order to decorate their image and deceive the masses, the Kuomintang reactionary government also set up four so-called leprosy hospitals, but the facilities were extremely rudimentary, the medical conditions were very poor, and some even had no medical staff at all. Patients who were admitted could not leave.
	After liberation, the Party and the government gave due attention to the prevention and treatment of leprosy. As early as June 1950, the Ministry of Health issued the "Circular on Matters Needing Attention in the Management of Leprosy" based on the health work policy of prevention first. At the National Epidemic Prevention Conference held in April 1951 and the National Health Administration Conference in 1952, the issue of leprosy prevention and treatment was discussed, and a plan was formulated. In 1953, the Ministry of Health held a leprosy symposium to discuss and propose methods for leprosy prevention and treatment. In particular, after the Party Central Committee issued the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956-1967," which put forward instructions on actively preventing and treating leprosy, many provinces, autonomous regions, and cities formulated their own leprosy prevention and treatment plans or made arrangements for leprosy prevention and treatment work. In June of this year, the Ministry of Health held a national leprosy prevention and treatment professional conference in Jinan. The "National Leprosy Prevention and Treatment Plan (Draft)" was discussed and approved, which determined that the current and future leprosy prevention and treatment work must adopt the principle of "active prevention and treatment, control of transmission," and take the steps and practices of "investigating, isolating, and treating simultaneously." These resolutions and measures have played a significant role in improving and strengthening leprosy prevention and treatment.
	In the past eight years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, great achievements have been made in leprosy prevention and treatment. First of all, various leprosy prevention and treatment and accommodation institutions have greatly developed, and many leprosy patients, especially infectious leprosy patients, have received the necessary isolation. According to incomplete statistics in the first half of this year, 50 new and expanded leprosy hospitals have been built across the country in recent years, and the number of leprosy beds has increased to more than 13,650. The equipment of existing leprosy hospitals is generally more complete, and the quality of medical care is gradually improving. Leprosy villages are a good form of isolation and accommodation for leprosy patients (mainly infectious leprosy patients) that have emerged in recent years. It is a special type of administrative village that combines treatment and production. At present, 114 leprosy villages have been built nationwide, with an accommodation capacity of more than 10,000 people. In addition, a large number of scattered leprosy patients have also been isolated by adopting local isolation methods according to their respective situations, which has played a certain role in controlling the transmission of leprosy. Before liberation, there was not a single leprosy prevention and treatment center or station in the country. In less than eight years after liberation, 157 have been developed. These leprosy prevention and treatment centers and stations are located in epidemic areas where leprosy is more serious, and they specifically undertake the organizational work and technical guidance of leprosy prevention and treatment.
	Secondly, before liberation, there were very few medical personnel specializing in leprosy prevention and treatment. Now, there are more than 2,000 professional prevention and treatment personnel at all levels who have undergone special training, among which senior prevention and treatment personnel account for a considerable proportion. In order to meet the needs of the increasingly developing national leprosy prevention and treatment work, the fifth advanced training class for leprosy prevention and treatment personnel of Shandong Medical College also started in mid-September this year.
	Third, it was unimaginable before liberation that leprosy could be cured, but today it has become a reality. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,520 leprosy patients have been cured. In addition, the condition of all treated patients has been alleviated to varying degrees. Regarding the treatment methods for leprosy, our country has not only widely adopted Western medicine treatments, but also began to experiment with the application of traditional Chinese medicine treatments, and has achieved certain results.
	Fourth, before liberation, there was no foundation for scientific research on leprosy. After liberation, the scientific research on leprosy has been included in the country's overall scientific research plan. In the future, the scientific research on leprosy will focus on the analysis and research of the clinical efficacy of various drugs for treating leprosy—especially the clinical research on the treatment of leprosy with traditional Chinese medicine, the experimental and clinical research on the prevention and vaccination of leprosy bacillus combined with BCG, the organization and isolation management methods for leprosy prevention and treatment, and epidemiological research, combined with the research on the pathological histology and pathophysiology of leprosy, and the bacteriological research on leprosy bacillus. Recently, a national leprosy research group composed of relevant experts has been established to uniformly plan, directly participate in, and guide scientific research on leprosy in various places.
	From here, it can be clearly seen that since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the development speed of leprosy prevention and treatment in our country is unprecedented, and the achievements made in leprosy prevention and treatment are also unprecedented in the history of our country. Of course, there are still many problems in leprosy prevention and treatment, mainly because many leprosy patients are still scattered throughout the country and have not received appropriate isolation and treatment; leprosy is still spreading and new cases are still occurring; and the health and spirit of the people are still threatened by leprosy. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, actively preventing and treating leprosy is still an extremely arduous task.

　　麻风病可以预防也能治好
　　张自宽
    许多年来，麻风病在群众中间一向被看作是“不治之症”。人们一提起麻风病，莫不谈虎色变，情绪紧张。人们之所以对麻风病如此恐惧并认为无法医治，除了因为他们不了解有关麻风病的科学知识和防治的办法以外，还由于他们在反动统治时期亲眼看到或实际体验到了麻风病人的凄惨的遭遇。在解放前，国民党反动政府对麻风病是不加防治的，它们对待麻风病人是采用枪杀、火烧、活埋等惨无人道的手段加以杀害，广东的陈济棠、青海的马步芳、山东的张宗昌等都曾成批、集体地屠杀过大量麻风病人。解放前，国民党反动政府为了点缀门面，欺骗群众，虽也设有四处所谓麻风病院，但设备极其简陋，医疗条件极差，有的甚至根本没有医务人员，病人入院是有进无出。
    解放后，党和政府对麻风病防治工作给予了应有的重视。早在1950年6月卫生部即根据预防为主的卫生工作方针，发布了“管理麻风应行注意事项的通报”；在1951年4月召开的全国防疫专业会议和1952年全国卫生行政会议上，都曾对防治麻风病的问题进行了讨论，并拟定了方案；1953年卫生部又曾召开了麻风病座谈会，讨论并提出了防治麻风病的办法；特别是在党中央发布的“关于1956—1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”，提出了积极防治麻风病的指示以后，许多省、自治区、市制定了本地区的麻风病防治规划或对麻风病防治工作作了安排。今年6月，卫生部又在济南召开了全国麻风病防治专业会议。讨论并通过了“全国麻风病防治规划（草案）”，确定了当前以及今后的麻风病防治工作，必须采取“积极防治，控制传染”的原则，并采取“边调查，边隔离，边治疗”的步骤和做法。这些决议和措施，对于改进和加强麻风病的防治工作，起了重大的作用。
    八年来，在党和政府的领导下，麻风病防治工作是有很大成绩的。首先是各类麻风病防治收容机构有了很大发展，许多麻风病人特别是传染性麻风病人得到了必要的隔离。据今年上半年的不完全统计，几年来全国已新建、扩建麻风病院五十处，麻风病床已增至一万三千六百五十多张，现有麻风病院的设备一般均较完善，医疗质量也在逐步提高；麻风村是近几年来新出现的隔离、收容麻风病人（主要是传染性麻风病人）的良好形式，它是一种治疗与生产相结合的特种性质的行政村。目前全国已建有麻风村一百一十四处，收容量约在万人以上。除此之外，还有大量散在的麻风病人，也分别情况采用了就地隔离的办法进行了隔离，这对于控制麻风病的传染起到了一定作用；麻风病防治所、站在解放前全国没有一个，解放后不到八年的时间即发展了一百五十七处，这些麻风病防治所、站均设在麻风病较严重的流行区，具体担当了防治麻风病的组织工作和技术指导工作。
    其次，解放前专门从事麻风病防治工作的医务人员寥寥无几，现在仅只经过专门训练的各级专业防治人员即已达二千余人，其中高级防治人员占相当比重。为了适应全国麻风病防治工作日益发展的需要，山东医学院第五届麻风病高级防治人员进修班又已在今年9月中旬开课了。
    第三，麻风病能够治得好，在解放前是不可想像的事，而在今天却已成为现实。仅据不完全的统计，业经治愈的麻风病人已达二千五百二十余人，除此之外，凡经治疗的病人，其病情也都有程度不同的减轻。关于麻风病的治疗方法，我国不仅广泛采用了西医药疗法，而且也开始实验应用了中医药疗法，并已取得了一定效果。
    第四，解放前，关于麻风病的科学研究工作毫无基础。解放后，麻风病的科学研究问题已经列入国家的科学研究总规划之中。今后麻风病的科学研究工作，将以各种治疗麻风病的药物的临床疗效的分析研究——特别是对于中医中药治疗麻风病的临床研究，麻风菌素结合卡介苗预防接种的实验及临床研究，麻风病防治组织、隔离管理方法，以及流行病学的研究为中心，并结合进行麻风病病理组织学及病理生理学的研究，麻风菌的细菌学研究等。最近成立了由有关专家组成的全国麻风病研究小组，以统一筹划并直接参加和指导各地有关麻风病的科学研究工作。
    从这里，可以明显地看出，解放以来，在党和政府的正确领导下，我国麻风病防治工作的发展速度是空前的，麻风病防治工作所取得的成就，也是我国历史从来没有的。当然，在麻风病防治工作中，也还存在着许多问题，主要是还有许多麻风病人迄今仍散在全国各地，尚未得到适当的隔离和治疗；麻风病仍在继续传染蔓延，新病例还在不断发生；人民群众的健康和精神，依然受着麻风病的威胁。因此，在今后相当长的时期内，积极防治麻风病仍是一项极其艰巨的任务。
