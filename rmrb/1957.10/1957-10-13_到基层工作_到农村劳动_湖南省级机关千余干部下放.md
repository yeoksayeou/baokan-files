Going to Work at the Grassroots Level, Going to Work in the Countryside
Over a Thousand Cadres from Hunan Provincial-Level Agencies Sent Down

(Our newspaper reports) In order to further strengthen rural work and the leadership of the current socialist debate in the countryside, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently transferred another thousand cadres from provincial-level agencies to the countryside. This group of cadres will go to the countryside in two batches on the 13th and 16th to work and participate in labor production in rural grassroots organizations for a relatively long period. Thirty percent of these cadres are at or above the deputy section chief level. From last winter to the present, Hunan Province has sent down more than 30,000 cadres from the provincial, prefectural, and county-level agencies. Among them, more than 8,900 people have directly returned to production posts, mainly as members of agricultural cooperatives. After a large number of cadres were sent down, the staff of provincial-level agencies has been reduced by 30% to 40% compared to the past, and work efficiency has improved compared to before. At the same time, grassroots leadership has also been greatly strengthened. Now, the party branch secretaries of all townships in the province are cadres who were originally members of district committees, and each township has more than three cadres who were originally district-level cadres. Many sent-down cadres have made remarkable achievements in their grassroots work. Zhou Yi, a former cadre of the Forestry Department, after being sent down to work in Qijiang Township, Longhui County, because of his determination to work in the countryside for the rest of his life and his ability to share weal and woe with the masses, is now not only familiar with agricultural production but also has made remarkable achievements in his work. He was recently rated as an A-level model worker at the Longhui County cadre expansion meeting. It is expected that after the more than 1,000 cadres recently transferred to the countryside, they will be a vital force in mobilizing the masses and carrying out the socialist debate.

　　到基层工作　到农村劳动
    湖南省级机关千余干部下放
    本报讯　中共湖南省委为了进一步加强农村工作和当前农村社会主义大辩论的领导力量，最近从省级机关又抽调一千多名干部下放到农村。这批干部将在13日和16日分两批下乡，他们要比较长期地在农村基层组织中工作和参加劳动生产。这批干部中有30％是副科长以上的干部。从去年冬天到现在，湖南省从省、专、县三级机关中已下放干部三万多名。其中有八千九百多人直接回到生产岗位，主要是到农业社当社员。大批干部下放后，省级机关的工作人员已比原来减少30％到40％，工作效率都比以前提高。同时，基层领导也大大加强，现在全省各乡的党总支书记，都是原来的区委委员等干部担任的，每乡都有三名以上的干部是原来的区级干部。很多下放的干部在基层工作中做出了显著的成绩。原林业厅干部周毅，下放到隆回县七江乡工作后，由于他决心在农村干一辈子，并能与群众同甘共苦，现在不仅已熟悉了农业生产，而且在工作中有显著成绩，最近在隆回县扩干会上被评为甲等模范工作者。预计最近抽调的一千多名干部下乡后，将是发动群众，开展社会主义大辩论的一支生力军。
