Ivakova and Our Tea Garden
Lu Zhenhao, Deputy Director of the October Tea Production Cooperative

　　In October 1955, Soviet tea expert Ivakova came to visit our cooperative—the October Tea Production Cooperative. This place is less than forty miles from West Lake in Hangzhou, surrounded by mountains and beautiful scenery, and is the main producing area of the famous Longjing tea. That day, every member of the cooperative received this distinguished guest with joy. After visiting the cooperative's tea garden and listening to the introduction of tea by the cooperative director Sun Guanshun, Comrade Ivakova put forward several valuable suggestions to us. She said that tea picking management is very important, such as being able to "leave fish leaves when picking spring tea, and leave one leaf when picking summer tea," which can enable the tea trees to produce more tea buds. She also suggested that we change summer plowing to autumn or winter plowing (which can reduce water evaporation), cultivate new tea gardens, transform old tea gardens, and implement row sowing.
　　According to the suggestion of this Soviet expert, our cooperative did a lot of experiments last year, and the results were very good. After adopting the method of "leaving fish leaves when picking spring tea, and leaving one leaf when picking summer tea" for 685 mu of tea trees, the growth was completely different from previous years. The growth of tea trees was also good after implementing autumn plowing.
　　Due to the realization of cooperativization, our production has increased rapidly. In 1955, the average yield of tea per mu was 141 jin, with a total output of more than 97,900 jin; in 1956, the average yield of tea per mu was 151 jin, with a total output of more than 100,340 jin; in 1957, the average yield of tea per mu was 170 jin, with a total output of 116,450 jin. With the development of production, the income of the members has also increased year by year. In 1955, each labor day was 1.5 yuan, and the average income per household of the 227 households in the cooperative was 490 yuan; in 1956, each labor day was 2.1 yuan, and the average income per household was 640 yuan; in 1957, the remuneration for each labor day has been increased to 2.5 yuan, and the average income per household will reach 700 yuan. In order to reduce the physical labor of the members, the cooperative bought ten tea-making machines this year. All the members of the cooperative are living very well, with enough to eat and wear. Last year, every family installed electric lights.
　　November 7th, this great day is coming soon. Recently, we held a symposium to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. The members unanimously believe that without the help of Soviet experts, our production and life could not have improved so quickly. In the future, we must work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve production, and strive to let the people of our country, the people of the world, especially the Soviet people, taste more Longjing tea with excellent color, aroma, and taste in 1958.

　　伊瓦若娃和我们的茶园
    十月茶叶生产合作社副社长  卢振豪
    1955年10月，苏联茶叶女专家伊瓦若娃到我们社——十月茶叶生产合作社来参观。这里离杭州西湖不到四十里，群山环抱、风景优美，是著名的龙井茶的主要产区。那天，每个社员怀着欢欣的心情接待了这位贵宾。在参观了社里的茶园和听了社主任孙官顺关于茶叶的介绍后，伊瓦若娃同志向我们提出了几点宝贵意见。她说，茶叶采摘管理很重要，如能做到“春茶留鱼叶采，夏茶留一叶采”，就能使茶树发出更多产茶芽头的枝眼。她还向我们建议，改夏天翻耕为秋耕或冬耕（可以减少水份的蒸发），培植新茶园，改造旧茶园，实行条播。
    根据这位苏联专家的建议，我们社在去年做了大量的试验，效果很好。六百八十五亩茶树采取“春茶留鱼叶采，夏茶留一叶采”的办法以后，生长同前几年完全不一样。实行秋翻耕后，茶树生长也都良好。
    由于实现了合作化，我们的生产提高得很快。1955年，全社平均每亩产茶一百四十一斤，总产量九万七千九百多斤；1956年，平均每亩产茶一百五十一斤，总产量十万零三千四百多斤；1957年每亩平均产茶一百七十斤，总产量十一万六千四百五十斤。随着生产的发展，社员的收入也逐年增加。1955年，每个劳动日一元五角，全社二百二十七户，每户平均收入四百九十元；1956年，每个劳动日二元一角，每户平均收入六百四十元；1957年，每个劳动日的报酬已提高到二元五角，每户平均收入将达到七百元。为了减轻社员的体力劳动，今年社里买了十部制茶机。全体社员的生活都过得很好，家家有吃有穿。在去年每家都装上了电灯。
    11月7日，这个伟大的日子快到了。最近我们召开了纪念十月革命四十周年的座谈会。社员们一致认为：如果没有苏联专家的帮助，我们的生产、生活不可能提高得这么快。今后我们一定要努力学习苏联先进经验，把生产搞得更好，争取在1958年让我国人民、世界人民特别是苏联人民尝到更多的色、香、味俱佳的龙井茶。
