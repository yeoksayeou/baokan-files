Xinhua News Agency, October 21st, London dispatch: Syrian President Kuwatli, in a telegram to the British "World News" on the 20th, reiterated that Syria would not allow any country to undermine its independence and freedom.

Kuwatli said that Turkey claims that their troops are gathering at the border due to normal military exercises. However, this exercise has continued for "an endless amount of time, completely different from the usual practice in ordinary military exercises."

Kuwatli's telegram was sent at the request of the "World News." The newspaper had asked the Syrian President, the King of Jordan, and the Turkish Prime Minister to express their views on the current situation and the prospects for easing tensions in the Middle East.

Kuwatli said: "The best way to ease tensions in the Middle East is to recognize our rights to freedom and the right to live in peace, especially to stop imperialist countries from supplying weapons to Israel and stop encouraging it to carry out aggression."

Xinhua News Agency, October 21st, Damascus dispatch: The "Flag" newspaper reported today that Syrian Prime Minister Asali said that if Turkey invades Syria, "every city and every village in Syria will be a second Port Said."

Asali made this statement at a meeting of representatives of the ruling parties of Syria on the evening of the 20th. He also said that if Turkey invades Syria, "all Arab countries will stand with Syria to repel the aggressors," and the Soviet Union will also intervene in this aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, October 21st, Baghdad dispatch: Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Iraq, Ibrahim Heluesel, said on the 19th that Saudi Arabian troops are prepared to defend Syria or other Arab countries.

The ambassador stayed in Beirut for a few days during Saudi Arabian King Saud's visit to Lebanon. Upon returning to Baghdad from Beirut, he said that the talks between Saud and Lebanese President Chamoun "resulted in unanimous agreement to support the independence and sovereignty of Syria."

He said: "The talks proved that the artificial divisions existing between Arab countries disappear immediately when they are subjected to aggression."

The ambassador expressed his hope that a high-level meeting of Arab countries could be arranged soon.

    叙总统重申独立自由不容破坏
    沙特阿拉伯军队准备保卫叙利亚
    新华社21日讯　伦敦消息：叙利亚总统库阿特利20日在给英国“世界新闻报”的一封电报中再次宣布，叙利亚不容许任何国家破坏它的独立和自由。
    库阿特利说，土耳其自称，他们的军队在边境集结是由于平常的军事演习。但是这种演习已经继续了“一段无止境的时间，跟普通军事演习中的惯常做法完全不同”。
    库阿特利的电报是应“世界新闻报”的请求而发的。这家报纸曾经要求叙利亚总统、约旦国王和土耳其总理发表他们对目前形势和缓和中东紧张局势前景的看法。
    库阿特利说：“缓和中东紧张局势的最好办法是承认我们的自由权利和过和平生活的权利，特别是使帝国主义国家停止把武器供给以色列，停止鼓励它进行侵略。”
    新华社21日讯　大马士革消息：“旗帜报”今天报道，叙利亚总理阿萨利说，如果土耳其侵略叙利亚，“叙利亚的每一个城市和每一个村庄都将是第二个塞得港”。
    阿萨利是在叙利亚各执政党代表在20日晚间举行的一次会议上说这番话的。他还说，如果土耳其侵略叙利亚，“所有的阿拉伯国家都将站在叙利亚一边来击退侵略者”，苏联也将会干涉这种侵略。
    新华社21日讯　巴格达消息：沙特阿拉伯驻伊拉克大使易卜拉欣·赫勒苏韦勒19日说，沙特阿拉伯军队准备保卫叙利亚或其他阿拉伯国家。
    这位大使在沙特阿拉伯国王沙特访问黎巴嫩期间在贝鲁特呆了几天。他在从贝鲁特回到巴格达时说，沙特和黎巴嫩总统夏蒙的会谈“结果是一致同意支持叙利亚的独立和主权”。
    他说：“会谈证明，阿拉伯国家之间存在的人为分歧在它们一旦遭受侵略时就立即消失了。”
    这位大使表示希望不久能够安排好一次阿拉伯国家的最高级会议。
