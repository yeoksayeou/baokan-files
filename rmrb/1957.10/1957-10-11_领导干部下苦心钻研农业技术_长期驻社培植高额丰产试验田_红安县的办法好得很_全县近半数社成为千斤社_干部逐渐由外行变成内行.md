Leading cadres dedicate themselves to studying agricultural technology.
Long-term presence in communes to cultivate high-yield experimental fields.
The method of Hong'an County is very good.
Nearly half of the communes in the county become thousand-jin communes. Cadres gradually transform from laymen into experts.

(According to our report) The leading cadres of Hong'an County, Hubei Province, have been stationed in agricultural cooperatives for a long time to participate in production, painstakingly study production technology, personally cultivate high-yield experimental fields, and encourage the masses to produce enthusiastically. This has promoted the achievement of increased production and bumper harvests in all 732 agricultural cooperatives throughout the county, with 313 of them becoming "thousand-jin" (500kg per mu) grain cooperatives.

County and district cadres in Hong'an County have gone deep into agricultural cooperatives and production teams, participating in and leading production, and personally cultivating experimental fields for technological reforms and high yields to provide typical demonstrations. Fourteen of the eighteen members of the county party committee have been stationed in rural areas to run cooperatives for a long time, each cultivating an experimental field, with most achieving high yields. Of the 276 district cadres, 195 cultivated experimental fields; of the 490 township cadres, 324 cultivated experimental fields. As a result, not only did the participation of leading cadres in production and leadership of production gain concrete content, but they also began to understand agricultural production knowledge, gradually transforming from laymen into experts, overcoming bureaucratism and subjectivism, and changing the past leadership style of empty political talk. Agricultural technicians also learned to follow the mass line in the process of cultivating experimental fields, better promoting agricultural technology. Leading cadres cultivated high-yield experimental fields as examples, educating the masses, helping them overcome conservative ideas, and actively improving the management of agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, this approach closely combined the Party's leadership, technological reforms, and the management of agricultural cooperatives, not only playing a demonstrative role in achieving high yields but also promoting large-scale increases in production. For example, County Party Secretary Cheng Peng personally experimented with a peanut field, achieving a yield of 800 jin per mu, which motivated the broad masses of cadres to experiment with and manage various crops such as peanuts, rice, and cotton for high yields. The county estimates that this year there will be 17 "thousand-jin" townships, 313 "thousand-jin" cooperatives, and over 163,800 "thousand-jin" mu for grain; 15 "thousand-jin" townships, 259 "thousand-jin" cooperatives, and over 10,900 "thousand-jin" mu for peanuts.

Relying on the foundation of cooperativization, Hong'an County has greatly changed the original appearance of barren land in the past two years. By this spring, the county had built a total of 49 reservoirs, newly dug 3,014 ponds and dams, renovated existing ponds and dams, and built a pumping station, ensuring harvests on more than 70% of the paddy fields. At the same time, double-cropping rice was promoted, the soil was improved, and wasteland was reclaimed. The level of agricultural production in the county has rapidly increased. On the basis of last year's bumper harvest, even greater harvests have been achieved this year. Although the autumn drought has been severe this year, grain production will exceed the highest historical level, with an estimated average yield of 820 jin per mu, an increase of 116.5% compared to 1952, 39.8% compared to 1955, and 19.9% compared to 1956. The average yield of peanuts is 625 jin per mu, exceeding the planning target for 1962 proposed by the provincial party committee, with a total estimated output of 30.6 million jin. In this hilly area, the estimated average yield of ginned cotton can also reach 50 jin per mu. All 732 agricultural cooperatives in the county have achieved increased production and bumper harvests. Farmers describe this year's harvest scene as: "Rice is like gold, cotton is like snow, peanut fields are green, and pigs are a sea of black."

　　领导干部下苦心钻研农业技术
    长期驻社培植高额丰产试验田
    红安县的办法好得很
    全县近半数社成为千斤社  干部逐渐由外行变成内行
    本报讯　湖北省红安县领导干部长期驻社参加生产，苦心钻研生产技术，亲自培植高额丰产试验田，带动群众热情生产，促进全县七百三十二个农业社达到社社增产、样样丰收，其中有三百一十三个社成为粮食千斤社。
    红安县县、区干部深入农业社和生产队，参加生产、领导生产，并亲手培养技术改革、高额丰产的试验田，进行典型示范。十八个县委委员有十四个委员长期驻农村办社，每人搞了一块试验田，多数获得了丰产。二百七十六名区干部中，有一百九十五人培植了试验田；四百九十名乡干部中，有三百二十四人培植了试验田。这样做的结果，不仅使领导干部参加生产领导生产有了具体内容，而且使他们开始懂得农业生产知识，逐渐由外行变成内行，克服了官僚主义和主观主义，改变了过去空谈政治的领导作风。农业技术干部也在培植试验田的过程中，学会走群众路线，更好地推行了农业技术。领导干部培植丰产试验田做出样子，教育了群众，帮助他们克服保守思想，积极改进农业社的经营管理。因此，这种做法就使党的领导、技术改革和农业社的管理三个工作紧密地结合在一起，不仅起了高额丰产的示范作用，而且推动了大面积的丰产。例如县委书记程鹏亲自试验了一块花生地，亩产达到八百斤，就带动了广大干部对花生、水稻、棉花各种作物的高额丰产的试验管理。全县预计今年将有粮食千斤乡十七个，千斤社三百一十三个，千斤亩十六万三千八百多亩；花生千斤乡十五个，千斤社二百五十九个，千斤亩一万零九百多亩。
    红安县依靠着合作化的基础，两年来，已使瘠薄的田地大大改变了原来的面貌。到今年春，全县共兴修水库四十九座，新开塘堰三千零十四口，旧有塘堰也进行了整修，并建设了一个抽水机站，使70％以上的水田达到了保收。同时，还推广了双季稻，改良了土壤，开发了荒田。全县农业生产水平迅速提高。在去年大丰收的基础上，今年又取得了更大的丰收。今年虽然秋旱严重，但粮食产量将超过历史上的最高水平，预计平均亩产八百二十斤，比1952年增产116.5％，比1955年增产39.8％，比1956年增产19.9％。花生平均亩产六百二十五斤，超过省委提出的1962年的规划指标，总产量预计为三千零六十万斤。棉花在这个丘陵山地，预计平均亩产皮棉也可达五十斤。全县七百三十二个农业社，社社增产，样样丰收。农民形容今年的丰收景象是：“稻谷似黄金，棉花如雪白，花生满畈青，生猪一片黑。”
