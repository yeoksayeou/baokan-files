    Fully Exploit the Combat Role of Marxist-Leninist Political Education
    Huang Nansen
    During the bourgeois rightists' attack on the Party and socialism, Marxist-Leninist political education became a prime target. The rightists unanimously claimed that political education was completely dogmatic and useless; many rightists openly advocated abolishing political education in universities. This argument once confused some people. Now it is very clear that the "dogmatism" the rightists speak of is Marxism-Leninism, and they are opposing Marxism-Leninism under the guise of opposing dogmatism.
    In the years since liberation, the teaching of political education in universities has been mainly successful, with shortcomings being secondary. We must affirm the achievements of political education based on facts and must also seriously examine the shortcomings of political education. However, this does not mean that we should relax the struggle against the rightists. On the contrary, it is precisely to strike the rightists harder.
    The achievements of political education are very obvious. The forms taken by the rightists' attacks and the widespread development of the anti-rightist struggle already illustrate this point. The main form of attack taken by the rightists is revisionism. Even if something is clearly anti-Marxist-Leninist, they still call it "Marxist-Leninist." Why is this? Do they have some fondness for Marxism-Leninism? No, they know that Marxism-Leninism has been widely disseminated and is deeply rooted in people's hearts. Without a Marxist-Leninist label, their bourgeois goods would not be easily sold. Political education cannot be said to have played no role in the dissemination of Marxism-Leninism. Secondly, does not the fact that political education has become a thorn in the side of the rightists illustrate its role in spreading Marxism-Leninism and criticizing bourgeois ideology? One rightist claimed that his theory was "anti-establishment philosophy," which is quite self-aware. They oppose political education precisely because it has played a huge role in transforming the thinking of young intellectuals in the past, and thus has become one of the huge obstacles for them to realize the restoration of the bourgeoisie. Thirdly, after the rightists' masks were pierced, a climax of counterattack against the rightists emerged among young intellectuals. In the counterattack, they used facts to refute the rightists, and also theoretically refuted the rightists completely. The practice of struggle proves that their mastery and application of Marxism-Leninism is still sufficient to counterattack the rightists' attacks. Without the work of political education in the past few years, the situation would be very different.
    The rightists' attack has tested political education, and it proves that the past political education teaching has been successful. The main shortcoming of past political education teaching was dogmatism. However, dogmatism is not, as the rightists think, that it has been too harsh in attacking bourgeois ideology. On the contrary, dogmatism lies in the fact that it has not been harsh enough in attacking bourgeois ideology, and the criticism has not been accurate enough or thorough enough. This shortcoming was fully exposed in the rightists' attack.
    Some rightists want political education to be held responsible for their anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, saying that it is because political education had a tendency of dogmatism in the past that they have fallen to this point. This is the rightists' sophistry to shirk responsibility, and it is also a clever attack on political education. In fact, many rightists have long been deliberately opposing the Party and socialism, and have never studied Marxism-Leninism properly for a single day. Political education cannot be held responsible for them. Some people only accepted Marxism-Leninism in words and on paper, but did not accept it in their hearts, or in other words, these people did not use Marxism-Leninism to transform their thinking. In the depths of their thinking, they still retained an independent kingdom of bourgeois ideology. The bourgeois ideology and the proletarian ideology in their minds coexisted peacefully and did not infringe upon each other. Therefore, when the rightists became rampant, the bourgeois ideology in these people's minds also took the opportunity to stir, to the point that they could not distinguish between right and wrong.
    What is especially serious is that some political education teachers, because they did not use Marxism-Leninism to transform themselves, spoke of Marxism-Leninism in the classroom, wrote of Marxism-Leninism in their articles, but in their hearts were completely anti-Marxist-Leninist bourgeois thoughts. Marxism-Leninism was not a weapon for them to transform the objective world and the subjective world, but a tool to obtain "fame." Under the rightists' attack, these people either wavered in their position, or fell into the quagmire and became rightists. These are not individual or accidental situations. The political education teaching and research section of Tsinghua University fell into a state of disintegration under the rightists' attack, and many teachers became rightists. There are also examples of political education teachers at Peking University who became rightists under the rightists' attack.
    Some comrades believe that the emergence of these confused thoughts is mainly due to the influence of the situation, which was not exposed in the past and could not be criticized. This is indeed the case, but at the same time, we should not completely ignore the principle of linking theory with practice, and the Party's rectification experience has not been well implemented in political education. The principle of "learning theory, improving understanding, linking with practice, and transforming thinking" is still only a matter of debate in universities, and has not been seriously and resolutely implemented. Especially in the recent two or three years, individualistic thinking and dogmatic tendencies have grown among political education teachers. Many teachers have neglected the ideological transformation of students, pursued the integrity of the system by detaching themselves from the students' ideological reality, and many teachers have been keen on obtaining associate doctoral titles and studying behind closed doors, which has greatly affected the ideological transformation in political education and their own ideological transformation.
    Therefore, I believe that although past political education has played a certain combat role, its combat role has not been fully exploited in the past.
    The socialist ideology education courses offered by various colleges and universities this year are significantly different from the past political education in terms of content and methods. In terms of content, instead of using the system of various political courses, the issues raised in Chairman Mao's work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" are used as the main content of the course, and the methods of large-scale debate and rectification are adopted. This change in content and method is based on the current political situation, and is also aimed at the dogmatic shortcomings that existed in political education teaching in the past.
    This year's course is not about discarding the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, but about using the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism to solve the problems in students' thinking; it is not about not reading books, but about reading books in order to powerfully counterattack the rightists; it is not about not having various realistic materials for revolution and construction, but about using these materials to explain realistic problems. Therefore, this year's political education is, on the one hand, the dissemination of living Marxism-Leninism, and profound socialist ideological education, and on the other hand, it is a systematic and profound criticism of various rightist remarks, and a wide-ranging criticism of various non-Marxist-Leninist thoughts.
    This is certainly not what the rightists want. The rightists oppose the "dogmatism" of political education in order to weaken its combativeness, or even completely abolish it; but our opposition to the dogmatism of political education results in strengthening its combativeness, in fully exploiting the theoretical power and combat role of Marxism-Leninism, and in closely combining theoretical work with realistic struggle. In essence, the socialist ideology education course in universities is the continuation and deepening of the anti-rightist struggle. It will make the anti-rightist struggle more in-depth and thorough ideologically and theoretically, and sweep away the toxins spread by the rightists and the ideological dregs left over from the old system more cleanly. In this way, our broad masses of college students will become people with higher socialist consciousness, and lay the ideological foundation for cultivating themselves into true working-class intellectuals.
    Some comrades believe that the current change in political education is only to adapt to the situation of the socialist great debate, and will restore the past systematic theoretical education next year. Yes, this change is to meet the needs of the current political situation, and next year will undoubtedly restore systematic theoretical education, but it would be wrong to conclude from this that this change is only of temporary significance, and that the systematic education restored next year will be exactly the same as in the past in terms of content and method. As mentioned earlier, this change is also aimed at the dogmatic shortcomings of past teaching work, so it cannot but have long-term significance, and the systematic theoretical education restored next year cannot be greatly different from the past in terms of content and method. Of course, exactly how different it will be remains to be gradually resolved in practice, but a few points can always be affirmed, that is: the teaching of the course will be more closely integrated with the political situation at the time, more closely integrated with the students' ideological reality, conscientiously implement the Party's rectification experience, and the ideological transformation and practical training of political education teachers will also be greatly strengthened. In short, it is to fully exploit the combat role of Marxism-Leninism in future systematic theoretical education, so that several political courses become a powerful assistant for the Party to conduct socialist ideological education for young intellectuals.

    充分发挥马列主义政治课的战斗作用
    黄枬森
    在资产阶级右派向党、向社会主义进攻时，马列主义政治课成了众矢之的。右派分子们异口同声地说政治课完全是教条主义，毫无用处；不少右派分子公开主张取消大学里的政治课。这种论调并曾迷惑了一部分人。现在事情已经十分清楚，右派分子所说的“教条主义”，就是马列主义，他们是以反对教条主义为幌子来反对马列主义。
    解放几年来，大学里的政治课的教学工作，成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的，我们必须实事求是地肯定政治课的成绩，也必须认真检查政治课的缺点，但是，这并不意味我们要放松对右派的斗争，相反，正是为了更狠地打击右派。
    政治课的成绩是非常明显的，右派进攻所采取的形式和反右派斗争的广泛展开已经能够说明这点。右派进攻所采取的形式主要是修正主义，那怕明明是反马列主义的东西，他们也要自称为“马列主义”。为什么要这样呢？难道他们对马列主义有什么偏爱么？不，原来他们深知马列主义已经广泛传播，深入人心，不贴上一张马列主义的标签，他们的资产阶级货色是不容易售出的。对于马列主义的传播，政治课不能说没有一份功劳。其次，政治课之成为右派的眼中钉，不正是说明政治课在传播马列主义和批判资产阶级思想的工作中有它的作用么？有一个右派分子自称他的学说是“反盘哲学”，这是颇有一点自知之明的。他们反对政治课，正因为政治课过去在青年知识分子中起了巨大的改造思想的作用，并从而成为他们实现资产阶级复辟的巨大障碍之一。第三，当右派的假面具被戳穿之后，青年知识分子中便出现了一个反击右派的高潮，在反击中，他们用事实来驳斥右派，而且也从理论上把右派批驳得体无完肤。斗争的实践证明，他们对于马列主义的掌握和运用还是足以反击右派的进攻的。如果没有过去几年的政治课的工作，情况就会大不相同。
    右派的进攻考验了政治课，它证明过去的政治课教学是有成绩的。过去政治课教学的主要缺点是教条主义。但是，教条主义并不如右派所想的在于对资产阶级思想打击得太狠，恰恰相反，教条主义正在于对资产阶级思想打击得不狠，批判得不够准，不够深透。这个缺点在右派的进攻中充分暴露出来。
    有些右派分子要政治课来为他们的反共反社会主义罪行负责，据说就是因为过去政治课有教条主义倾向，他们才沦落到这种地步的。这是右派分子推卸责任的狡辩，同时也是对政治课的一种巧妙的进攻。事实上许多右派分子都是早就处心积虑地反对党、反对社会主义的，从来就没有好好学过一天马列主义，政治课是不能对他们负什么责任的。也有些人只是口头上、字面上接受了马列主义，心里面并未接受，或者说这些人没有用马列主义来改造自己的思想，在他们的思想深处，还保存着一个资产阶级思想的独立王国，他们头脑中的资产阶级思想和无产阶级思想和平共处、互不侵犯。因此，当右派猖狂起来的时候，这些人头脑中的资产阶级思想也趁机蠢动起来，以至大是大非都分不清楚了。
    尤其严重的是有些政治课教员，由于没有用马列主义来改造自己，在课堂上讲的是马列主义，文章里写的是马列主义，而内心里却完全是反马列主义的资产阶级思想，马列主义在他们不是改造客观世界和主观世界的武器，而是猎取“功名”的工具。这些人在右派进攻下，轻则立场动摇，重则失足成为右派分子。这些都不是个别的偶然的情况。清华大学的政治课教研室在右派进攻下陷于瓦解的状态，不少教员沦为右派分子。在右派进攻下沦为右派分子的例子，北京大学的政治课教员中也是有的。
    有些同志认为这些混乱思想的产生，主要是由于形势的影响，过去并未暴露，也无从批判。事实确是如此，但是，同时也不应该完全忽略理论联系实际的方针、党的整风经验并未很好地在政治课中贯彻。“学习理论、提高认识、联系实际、改造思想”的方针，在大学里还只是一个争论的问题，并未认真地、坚决地贯彻。特别是最近两三年，在政治课教员中滋长了个人主义思想和教条主义倾向，许多教员忽视学生的思想改造，脱离学生思想实际来追求体系的完整性，许多教员醉心于摘取副博士头衔，闭户读书，这就大大影响了政治课中的思想改造和自己的思想改造。
    因此，我认为过去的政治课虽然发挥了一定的战斗作用，但它的战斗作用在过去并未充分发挥出来。
    今年各高等学校开设的社会主义思想教育课程，在内容和方法方面都同过去的政治课有显著不同。在内容方面，不是以各门政治课的体系而是以毛主席的著作“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题”中所提出的问题作为课程的主要内容，采取了大辩论和整风的方法。内容和方法的这种改变，其根据就是当前的政治形势，同时也是针对过去在政治课教学中所存在的教条主义缺点。
    今年的课程并不是丢掉马列主义基本原理，而是用马列主义基本原理来解决学生们思想中的问题；不是不要读书，而是为了有力地反击右派而读书；不是不要革命和建设的各种现实材料，而是用这些材料来说明现实问题。因此，今年的政治课一方面是活生生的马列主义的传播，是深刻的社会主义思想教育，另一方面就是对各种右派言论的系统的深刻的批判，对各种非马列主义思想的广泛的批判。
    这当然是右派所不希望的。右派反对政治课的“教条主义”是想削弱它的战斗性，甚至根本取消它；而我们反对政治课的教条主义的结果却是加强它的战斗性，却是充分发挥马列主义的理论威力、战斗作用，却是把理论工作同现实斗争紧密地结合起来。实质上，大学里的社会主义思想教育课程就是反右派斗争的继续和深刻化，它将使反右派斗争在思想上、理论上更加深入、更加彻底，把右派所散布的毒素、旧制度所残留的思想渣滓扫除得更加干净。这样，我们的广大的大学生们就将成为具有更高社会主义觉悟的人，并为把自己培养成为真正的工人阶级知识分子打下思想基础。
    有的同志认为政治课目前的改变仅仅是为了适应社会主义大辩论的形势，明年还会恢复过去的系统理论教育。是的，这次改变是为了适应目前政治形势的需要，明年也无疑要恢复系统理论教育，但是，如果从这里得出结论，认为这次的改变仅仅具有暂时的意义，认为明年的系统教育在内容和方式上还会同过去完全一样，那就错了。正如前面所说过的，这次改变还针对了过去教学工作的教条主义缺点，因而它不能不具有长远的意义，明年恢复的系统理论教育在内容和方式上也不能不同过去大大不同。当然，究竟怎样不同，还有待于在实践中逐步加以解决，但是，有几点总是可以肯定的，那就是：课程的讲授将更加紧密结合当时的政治形势，更加紧密结合学生的思想实际，认真贯彻党的整风经验，政治课教员的思想改造和实际锻炼也要大大加强，总而言之，就是把马列主义的战斗作用在将来的系统理论教育中充分发挥出来，使几门政治课成为党对青年知识分子进行社会主义思想教育中的有力助手。
