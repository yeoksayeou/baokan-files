Clear Thoughts, Valuable Art
    — Reflections on the Italian Film “Police and Thieves”
    Xie Liming
    In the creative process of film art, people often intentionally avoid two kinds of failures: either over-pursuing the novelty and originality of "montage" and the twists and turns of the story, but neglecting the truth of life content, thus becoming superficial and hypocritical; or only paying attention to the truth and naturalness of depicting life details, but neglecting the rigorousness and unity of the artistic structure, thus becoming cumbersome and loose. However, to truly overcome the above drawbacks and create a film that is both rich in life atmosphere and has a tight artistic structure is not an easy task. The Italian film "Police and Thieves" is relatively successful in this regard.
    Italy is thousands of miles away from our country, but when we watch the film "Police and Thieves," we feel that our hearts are so close to the hearts of the Italian people. In the constantly amusing plots, we see how the capitalist system forces kind and pure people into awkward and difficult situations; in many touching episodes, we also understand the virtues of the masses of people living under capitalist shackles and their tenacious will to survive.
    Why does this film have such a profound impact on us? I think one of the important reasons is that it has both a strong atmosphere of life and a unified, complete, tortuous, and interesting artistic structure.
    The thief Esposito and the policeman Bottoni are two opposing characters. The continuous action of the policeman trying his best to hunt down the thief and the continuous action of the thief's alertness in hiding and escaping misfortune intersect, constituting the consistent main conflict of the film. A series of wonderful montages are produced in the development of this main conflict. Therefore, at a glance, one can touch upon these advantages of the film's artistic structure: clear context, sharp struggle, and strong action. However, if we can study it more deeply, we will come into contact with something more important, that is, the author firmly grasps life, analyzes life, and extracts the most humorous and infectious details from life materials, giving them careful polishing, processing, and creation, so that they are organically organized into a unified artistic conception. Therefore, this film is full of life everywhere, and every section is art.
    The filmmakers (including screenwriters, directors, and actors) have worked hard to meticulously process and create ordinary life materials, which is traceable. The authors first explored the multiple contradictions hidden in life and then organized rich and colorful dramatic artistic plots on the premise of analyzing the objectively existing contradictory factors. Let us take the scene where the policeman Bottoni comes to the thief Esposito's house as a guest as an example. At this time, the policeman, in order to catch the thief, has tried his best to become friends with the thief's wife and children. Just as he was visiting the thief's house, he suddenly found the thief. If the author had only explored the contradiction between the policeman and the thief in this scene, then he could have immediately arrested the thief. However, the author did not take this approach. Instead, he arranged for these two opposing characters to sit at a table politely and eat together. Why make such an arrangement? That is, first, both the policeman and the thief are people who are oppressed and threatened by the police chief and the American rich, and their survival wills have a profound contradiction with the capitalist social system. Therefore, there is a certain degree of sympathy between them. Second, in the process of the policeman's investigation and pursuit of the thief, he established friendship between his family and the thief's family. This friendship is contradictory to his intention to arrest the thief; at the same time, the purpose of arresting the thief is contradictory to his desire not to reveal this purpose in front of his wife and children. Therefore, he must sit down at the table with a straight face as a guest in front of his wife and daughter. Third, the thief commits theft outside and knows that it is shameful, so he has always concealed it from his wife and children. This hidden situation restricted his actions, making him afraid to run away in this gathering of the two families. Therefore, he had to sit down and entertain the guests as the host. These are the multiple contradictions contained in this scene. The rich and colorful dramatic nature of this scene arises from this. These dramatically changing plots are natural and subtly meaningful, making people feel sincerely moved.
    The author's characterization of the characters is also based on the specific manifestations of the characters in life. The author chose the most humorous and characteristic daily actions to make the characters stand out, so that the characters can develop forward in a strong atmosphere of life, without the drawbacks of forced拼凑and violating common sense. At the same time, precisely because the characterization of the characters and the naturalness of the plot are coexisting, it has created the following result: the process of the story's change is the process of the character's development. As the story develops, the characters gradually become complete and profound. After watching this film, I have been unable to forget the impression of the clumsy, big-bellied policeman and the clever, thin thief for a long time, and I think there is a reason for this.
    Even more cleverly, the author expresses the characters' ideological changes through the characterization of the characters and daily life actions. The characters' thoughts are expressed as much as possible not directly through language, but through action. This is originally an important technique in film creation, and we have seen many films that use it skillfully. However, there are not many films that can truly express thoughts through subtle life actions. This film has achieved remarkable success in this regard.
    "Police and Thieves" is a realistic work with high achievements. I think its greatest success in terms of technique is that it expresses ordinary life extremely smoothly and delicately, but it is not life itself, but art.
    Undoubtedly, this is a film with deep popular appeal. Its ideological content is positive and progressive. Regarding the phenomena of theft and deception, the author not only criticized them through the thief's shame and inferiority but, more importantly, the author denounced the capitalist social system and expressed deep hatred for that social system.

    明朗的思想，可贵的艺术
    ——意大利影片“警察与小偷”观后感
    谢力鸣
    在电影艺术的创作过程中，人们常常有意地避免这样两种失败的结果：或者过分追求“蒙太奇”的新颖、出奇，和故事的曲折变化，却忽视了生活内容的真实，因而流于肤浅、虚伪；或者仅仅注意了描写生活细节的真实、自然，却忽视了艺术结构的严谨、统一，因而流于烦琐、松散。可是，要真正克服上述流弊，创造一部既富有生活气息又具有严密的艺术结构的影片，并不是一件轻而易举的事。而意大利影片“警察与小偷”在这方面却是比较成功的。
    意大利距我国遥遥数万里，但是在我们观看影片“警察与小偷”时，却感到我们的心同意大利人民的心如此接近。在不断引人发笑的情节中，我们看见资本主义制度把善良、纯洁的人民逼得如何尴尬难堪；在多少令人辛酸的情节中，又使我们理解到在资本主义枷锁下生活着的人民群众的美德以及他们的顽强的求生意志。
    这部影片为什么会在我们身上产生这样深刻的影响？我想，重要原因之一就是它既具有浓烈的生活气息，又具有一个统一完整、曲折有趣的艺术结构。
    小偷埃斯波西多同警察波多尼是两个互相对立的人物。警察费尽心机追捕小偷的贯串动作与小偷的机警躲藏逃避噩运的贯串动作的交叉，构成了影片的始终如一的主要冲突。而一连串精彩的蒙太奇便是在这个主要冲突的发展中产生的。因此，草草一看便可接触到影片艺术结构上的这些优点：脉络清晰，斗争尖锐，动作性强烈。但是，我们若能较为深入地去研究一下，则会接触到更重要的东西，那就是作者牢牢地把握了生活，分析了生活，从生活素材中提炼了最有风趣、最富有感染力的细节，给予精雕细琢，加工创造，使之有机地组织于一个统一的艺术构思之中。因此，才使得这部影片处处是生活，节节是艺术。
    影片创作者们（包括编剧、导演、演员）苦心孤诣在平凡的生活材料上进行精密的加工、创造，是有迹可察的。作者们首先发掘了生活中潜隐着的多重矛盾，并进而在分析客观存在的矛盾因素的前提下组织了丰富多采的富有戏剧性的艺术情节。且举其中警察波多尼来到小偷埃斯波西多家作客的一场戏为例。这时警察为了追捕小偷，已经千方百计同小偷的老婆、孩子结成了朋友。正在他到小偷家去作客时，忽然找到了小偷。假如作者在这段戏中仅仅发掘了警察和小偷的矛盾，那么，他尽可以使警察立即将小偷逮捕起来。可是，作者不但没有采取这样的处理，反而把这两个对立的人物安排到一个桌上客客气气地吃饭去了。为什么要作这样的安排？那就是第一，警察和小偷都是受警长和美国阔佬欺压威胁的人，他们两人的生存意志都同资本主义社会制度有着深刻的矛盾。因此，他们之间有着一定程度的同情心。第二，在警察侦察追捕小偷的过程中使自己的家庭同小偷的家庭建立起友情，这种友情同他要逮捕小偷的意图是矛盾的；同时，要逮捕小偷的目的又同他不愿在妻子儿女面前暴露这一目的的心情相矛盾，因此他必需在自己的老婆、女儿面前以作客的姿态一本正经地坐下来吃饭。第三，小偷在外边作贼，自知可耻，因而一向是瞒着老婆和孩子的。这种隐秘情况限制了他的行动，使他不敢在这种两家聚会的场合逃跑。因此，他也只好以主人姿态坐下来招待客人。这便是这段戏中所蕴藏着的几重矛盾。而这场戏的丰富多采的戏剧性便由此而生。这些色彩丰富的戏剧性情节变化自然，寓意微妙，使人看了不由得不由衷感动。
    作者对于人物性格的刻划，也是以人物在生活中的具体表现为材料的。作者选择了最有风趣、最具特征的日常行动使人物性格突现出来，因而使得人物性格能够在浓烈的生活气息中向前发展，而没有生拼硬凑违反常情的弊病。同时，也正因为人物的性格化与故事情节的生活化是同时并存的，所以造成了这样一种结果：故事的变化过程就是人物性格的发展过程，随着故事的发展，人物性格逐步完整起来，深刻起来。我看了这部影片之后，长久未能忘掉那个笨拙的大肚子警察和那个机灵瘦小的小偷的印象，想来是不无原因的了。
    更为巧妙的是作者通过人物的性格化和日常的生活动作来表现人物的思想变化。人物的思想尽可能不用语言直接表达出来，而使之表现为行动。这本来是电影创作的重要手法，我们见过许多影片都熟练地运用了它。但能够真正通过细腻的生活动作来表现思想的影片却并不怎么多。而这部影片却在这方面取得了显著成就。
    “警察与小偷”是一部具有很高成就的现实主义作品，我认为它在技巧上的最大成功是极流畅地、极细腻地表现了平凡的生活，但它又不是生活本身，而是艺术。
    无疑，这是一部具有深刻的人民性的影片，它的思想内容是积极的，进步的。对于偷窃、欺骗现象，作者不但通过小偷的羞愧、自卑给予了批判，更重要的是作者控诉了资本主义社会制度，并且表现了对那种社会制度的深刻憎恨。
