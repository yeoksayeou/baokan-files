    —Wei Zhuang Agricultural Cooperative Holds Great Debate
    Xinhua News Agency: The Wei Zhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beidunfa Township, Daxing County, Hebei Province, has entered a high tide of socialist great debate. At the debate, seven farmers who had been beggars in the past spoke, using methods such as presenting facts, reasoning, and recalling comparisons, to persuade some people who originally wanted to take the capitalist road. At the same time as the great debate, a "Compare the Past, See the Present" physical exhibition was also held. After the debate, the socialist righteousness in Wei Zhuang Cooperative greatly increased, and the broad masses of farmers underwent profound changes in their thinking, recognized the benefits of cooperation and unified purchase and sale of grain, and resolutely followed the Communist Party on the road of cooperation.

    Zhang Fengcai, who worked as a farmhand for more than 30 years and had been a beggar, brought his old clothes, quilt, and bamboo clapper from his begging days to participate in the debate. He said: "In 1943, my family didn't see a grain of corn for a full forty days. Throughout the year, we were always worried about eating and couldn't afford clothes. In winter, the whole family shared one quilt. After I joined the advanced cooperative, I built three new brick houses last year."
    Old Lady Li was not very satisfied with the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and liked to say strange things. Her granddaughter, Li Yaren (right), a high school graduate, took the time to explain to her grandmother the benefits of unified purchase and sale and the reasons for it.
    On the evening of October 14, the Wei Zhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Daxing County held a physical exhibition. On the left were the clothes and quilts worn by fourteen poor peasant households in the village when they begged outside in the past (1943). On the right were newly added thermos bottles, rubber shoes, and crystal radios after liberation. This exhibition enhanced the awareness of the cooperative members.
    After the group debates, debates on the two roads also unfolded in some families. After joining the cooperative, well-to-do middle peasant Sun Shouyi did not work hard, but instead used his rubber-wheeled cart for transportation and business, and wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. His wife, Hu Nairong, criticized his capitalist thinking.

    深刻的教育
    ——魏庄农业社举行大辩论
    河北省大兴县北顿垡乡魏庄农业生产合作社进入社会主义大辩论高潮。在辩论会上，有七个过去要过饭的农民都发了言，他们用摆事实、讲道理、回忆对比等方式，说服了一部分原来想走资本主义道路的人。在大辩论的同时，还举办了一个“比比过去、看看现在”的实物展览会。经过辩论后，魏庄社里社会主义正气大大上升，广大农民在思想上起了深刻的变化，认清了合作化和粮食统购统销的好处，坚决跟着共产党走合作化的道路。　新华社记者　盛果摄（附图片）
    当了三十多年长工、要过饭的张凤才，带着他过去要饭时的破衣服、被子、打竹板参加辩论会，他说：“1943年，我家整四十天没见棒子粒，一年到头总是顾吃顾不了穿，到冬天全家盖一床被子。我参加了高级社后，去年就新盖了三间砖房。”
    李老太太对粮食统购统销政策不大满意，爱说些怪话，她的孙女高小毕业生李雅仁（右）抽空向奶奶解说统购统销的好处和为什么要统购统销的道理。
    10月14日晚上，大兴县魏庄农业社举行了一个实物展览会。左边是这村在过去（1943年）十四户贫农在外面要饭时所穿的衣服和被子。右边是解放后新添制的暖水瓶、胶鞋、矿石收音机等。通过这个展览会，提高了社员们的觉悟。
    在小组辩论会以后，有些家庭里也展开了两条道路的争辩。富裕中农孙守义入社后不好好劳动，反而用自己的一辆胶皮大车去搞运输，做生意，又想退社。他的爱人扈乃荣对他的资本主义思想进行了批评。
