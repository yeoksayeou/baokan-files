Athletes from the Shandong Peninsula, totaling fifty individuals, constitute one of the larger teams at this National Games.

Domestically, the Shandong track and field team has consistently demonstrated strong capabilities.

Among the Shandong team members, several are veterans with experience in previous National Games. For example, Li Bingcheng, a male athlete in discus and shot put, although not young, can still throw the discus over forty-three meters. Lü Yan, a triple jump athlete, and You Yunting, a 10,000-meter runner, are both veterans nearing forty. These veterans form the team's fundamental strength.

However, the Shandong team also possesses a significant number of young and emerging talents. The average age of the team's athletes is only twenty-one. Shi Hongfan, a male high jumper, is only sixteen years old, and Li Jidong, a fifteen-year-old female high jumper, is the team's youngest member and a promising young athlete.

The Shandong team is known for its tall stature and physical strength; each member seems to have inexhaustible energy.

    山东半岛上的健儿
    来自山东半岛的健儿共五十人，是这次全运会上人数较多的一队。
    在国内，山东田径代表队的实力一向比较强。
    山东队的成员，有不少是历次参加全国运动会的老将。如男子铁饼、铅球运动员李秉诚，虽然年龄已经不算轻了，但是他的铁饼还能掷四十三公尺多。三级跳远运动员吕暥，万公尺长跑运动员酉云亭，都是年近四十的老将。这些老将，是他们队的基本实力。
    但是，山东队也是一支拥有年轻的新生力量较多的队伍。全队运动员的平均年龄只有二十一岁。男子跳高运动员史洪范只有十六岁，十五岁的女子跳高运动员李季冬是该队年龄最轻的小妹妹，她是一位很有前途的少年运动员。
    山东队向以个子高、体力强出名，每个队员似乎都有使不完的精力。
