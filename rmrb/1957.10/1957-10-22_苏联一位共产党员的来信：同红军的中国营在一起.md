A Letter from a Soviet Communist Party Member:
    With the Chinese Battalion of the Red Army

Dear Comrades:

    The unforgettable period of the Civil War has long passed. As the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution approaches, the Chinese comrades who fought alongside us to defend the young Soviet Republic, their heroism and their spirit of infinite loyalty to fraternal friendship, resurface in my memory.

    What impressed me most was the situation in which the First Light Artillery Battalion of Voroshilov and the Chinese Battalion disarmed the Menshevik troops in the city of Voroshilov.

    This happened in the spring of 1918. Comrade Davydovich, the battalion instructor, called me and said, "The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Executive Committee have assigned a task," which was to prepare the artillery unit for an attack at four o'clock at dawn. He said, "We will be conducting a small battle." This battle was to disarm the Menshevik troops in the city of Voroshilov. We completed this task very quickly and excellently. Not long after, we received another task from the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Executive Committee to disarm the anarchists entrenched in the Voroshilov Middle School. We also completed this battle very well together with the Chinese comrades.

    In the summer of 1918, the remnants of the Socialist Revolutionaries, the Mensheviks, and the anarchists launched a riot and demanded that the Bolsheviks in Voroshilov immediately withdraw from the city.

    The Chinese Battalion and the First Light Artillery Battalion of Voroshilov performed particularly well in suppressing the Socialist Revolutionary riot and crushing the Socialist Revolutionary headquarters. The Socialist Revolutionaries fortified themselves in Sobachi-Usman and built machine-gun bunkers to prevent our infantry from advancing. At this time, artillery fire was needed to destroy the enemy's machine-gun nests.

    The enemy's machine guns were discovered by the Chinese comrades and immediately destroyed by our artillery. Indeed, the enemy was superior in numbers at that time, but thanks to the fraternal friendship and solidarity between the Chinese comrades and us, and the bravery of the comrades, Sobachi-Usman was captured after a fierce battle, and the headquarters of the Socialist Revolutionaries was annihilated.

    In this way, our Chinese friends wrote many glorious pages in the history of the Civil War with their battle deeds, leaving behind the fruits of the Great October Revolution together with us.

    In these days, while recalling the battle achievements of the Chinese comrades, I am deeply rejoiced by the achievements of China in socialist construction today. Today, I would like to express my gratitude to you through your newspaper and wish the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, born in the flames of the fierce struggle against the enemy, everlasting.

### 苏联一位共产党员的来信：同红军的中国营在一起

    苏联一位共产党员的来信：
    同红军的中国营在一起亲爱的同志们：
    难忘的国内战争时期已经过去很久了。在伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年即将到来的时候，同我们一起为保卫年青的苏维埃共和国而对敌作战的中国同志，他们的英勇和对兄弟友谊无限忠诚的精神又在我的记忆里涌现出来了。
    我印象最深的是，伏龙芝第一轻炮兵营和中国营在伏龙芝城解除孟什维克部队的武装的情形。
    这是1918年春天的事。营指战员达维多维奇同志把我叫来说，“省委和省执行委员会交下任务了”，是要准备拂晓四时出击的炮队，他说，“我们将进行一次不大的战役”。这次战役就是解除伏龙芝城孟什维克部队的武装。这个任务我们完成得非常迅速而出色。过了不久，我们又从省委和省执行委员会得到解除盘据在伏龙芝中学的无政府主义者的武装的任务。我们又同中国同志一道很好地完成了这一战役。
    1918年的夏天，社会革命党人、孟什维克和无政府主义者的残余一道掀起了暴乱，并且要求伏龙芝的布尔什维克立即撤出伏龙芝城。
    为了镇压社会革命党人的暴乱和粉碎社会革命党人的司令部，中国营和伏龙芝第一轻炮兵营表现得特别出色。社会革命党人在索巴奇—乌斯曼设防，并构筑了机枪掩体阻止我们步兵前进。这时需要用炮兵火力摧毁敌人的机枪巢。
    敌人的机枪被中国同志发现了，并且立刻被我们的炮队摧毁。的确，当时敌人在人数上占优势，但是由于中国同志与我们的兄弟友谊、团结和同志们的勇敢，经过激烈的战斗，索巴奇—乌斯曼被攻克了，社会革命党人的司令部被歼灭了。
    这样，我们的中国朋友以自己的战斗事迹在国内战争的历史里写下了许多光辉的篇页，同我们一起留下了伟大十月的成果。
    在这些日子里，在回忆中国同志的战斗功勋的时候，我深为今天中国在社会主义建设中的成就而欢欣鼓舞。今天，我想通过贵报表达对你们的感谢，并祝在同敌人顽强斗争的战火中诞生的中苏人民的兄弟友谊万古常青。
