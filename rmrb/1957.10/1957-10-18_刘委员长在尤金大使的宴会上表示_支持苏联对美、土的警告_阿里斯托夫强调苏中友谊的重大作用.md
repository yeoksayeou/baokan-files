Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: Chairman Liu Shaoqi, at Ambassador Yudin's banquet today, expressed support for the Soviet leaders' recent condemnation and warnings to U.S. imperialism and Turkey. He said, "We solemnly warn the U.S. imperialists: If you insist on playing with fire, you will certainly come to no good end."

To welcome the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation headed by A.B. Aristov's visit to China, Soviet Ambassador to China, Yudin, held a banquet in Beijing this evening.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai were invited to attend the banquet.

The Czechoslovak National Assembly delegation headed by Chairman Fierlinger, and the Prague City Central People's Committee delegation headed by Mayor Svoboda, were also invited to attend the banquet.

Head of Delegation Aristov and Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke at the meeting, unanimously emphasizing the need to further strengthen the eternal and unbreakable great friendship between the eight hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union.

In his speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi expressed his support for the Soviet leaders' recent condemnation and warnings to U.S. imperialism and Turkey. He pointed out that after the failure of a series of conspiracies planned by U.S. imperialism to subvert the Syrian government, it is currently directing Turkey to prepare for an armed invasion of Syria, and the situation is very serious. This tense situation not only seriously threatens the independence and security of Syria and the countries of the Near and Middle East, but also seriously threatens world peace and security. The Chinese people, like the Soviet people, resolutely stand on the side of the Syrian people. We solemnly warn the U.S. imperialists: If you insist on playing with fire, you will certainly come to no good end!

In his speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out that the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation's visit to our country coincides with the time when our people are celebrating the eighth anniversary of the founding of our country and warmly welcoming the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. The delegation brought to the Chinese people the brotherly friendship and good wishes of the great Soviet people, which is not only a great encouragement to the Chinese people in carrying out socialist construction, but also greatly enhances the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, warmly congratulated the Soviet Union on its great scientific achievement in launching the first man-made Earth satellite.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi also said: "The people of China and the Soviet Union are the closest brothers and comrades-in-arms. Our two countries, with eight hundred million people, are advancing shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand in maintaining world peace and developing human progress. This friendly and cooperative relationship cannot be hindered by any force and is indestructible and invincible." The Chinese people realize that the victory of the Chinese revolution and the achievements of socialist construction were achieved along the path of the great October Socialist Revolution. In the future, we will continue to earnestly learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experiences and science and technology so as to build our country into a prosperous, strong, and great socialist country as quickly as possible.

Before Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech, Head of Delegation Aristov said that in meetings and discussions with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the state, as well as with people from all walks of life in China, the delegation had repeatedly deeply felt the profound respect and love that the Chinese people have for the Soviet people. He expressed, on behalf of all the delegation members, his heartfelt gratitude for the warm welcome and cordial hospitality extended to them.

Aristov said: "The fraternal alliance and friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China are built on the basis of common interests in the struggle for the victory of socialism and communism, and for world peace. This alliance and friendship plays an important role in the smooth development of our two countries. Our friendship is full of mutual assistance, exchange of experience, mutual learning, and thus a sincere desire to advance more quickly side by side." Aristov pointed out that a good tradition of mutual visits by parliamentary delegations and national and party activists has been established between the people of the Soviet Union and China. Such visits will strengthen mutual understanding, thereby further strengthening the unbreakable friendship between the people of the two countries.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Fierlinger, and Ambassador Yudin successively raised their glasses at the meeting, together with Chinese and foreign guests, to the fraternal friendship of the people of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and China, to the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to world peace.

After the banquet, the Novosibirsk State Opera and Ballet Theater of the Soviet Union performed a ballet.

Also present at the banquet tonight were Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Deng Xiaoping, He Long, and Chen Yi, Vice Premiers of the State Council; Dong Biwu, President of the Supreme People's Court; Zeng Yongquan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs; Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; responsible persons of various democratic parties and people's organizations; people from all walks of life in the capital; and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

    在刘少奇委员长讲话以前，阿里斯托夫团长讲话说，代表团在同中国共产党和国家领导人，以及同中国各阶层人民的会见和座谈中，一次又一次地深深体会到中国人民对苏联人民所怀着的深厚敬爱的感情。他代表全体团员对给予他们的热烈欢迎和亲切款待表示衷心的感谢。
    阿里斯托夫说：“苏中两国人民之间的兄弟联盟和友谊是建筑在为社会主义和共产主义的胜利，为世界和平而斗争的共同利益的基础之上的，这种联盟和友谊对我们两国的顺利发展起着重要的作用。在我们的友谊中，充满着互助、交流经验、相互学习、从而更迅速地并肩前进的真诚愿望。”阿里斯托夫指出，苏中两国人民之间已经建立了两国议会代表团以及国家和党的活动家进行相互访问的良好传统，这种访问将加强相互了解，从而使两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊得到进一步的加强。
    周恩来总理、费林格主席和尤金大使先后在会上举杯敬酒，同中外来宾们一起为苏、捷、中三国人民的兄弟友谊，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，为世界和平干杯。
