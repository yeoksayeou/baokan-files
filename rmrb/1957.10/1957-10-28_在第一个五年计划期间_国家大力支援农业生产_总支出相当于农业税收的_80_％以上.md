Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: During the First Five-Year Plan, the state provided substantial support for agricultural production.

Including the estimated figures for this year, the total direct and indirect expenditure by the state on developing agricultural production during these five years reached 12.83 billion yuan. This expenditure is equivalent to more than 80% of the agricultural tax paid by farmers during the same period. The state's timely provision of agricultural loans and disaster relief funds has played a significant role in developing agricultural production and helping farmers overcome natural disasters. For example, in 1956, when agricultural cooperatives had just been realized, many cooperatives had a relatively weak economic foundation and generally felt a shortage of production funds. In order to help cooperatives overcome this difficulty and ensure good production that year, the state issued 3.1 billion yuan in loans, under the premise of emphasizing diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives, to support them in building farmland water conservancy projects and purchasing a large amount of production materials. Farmers in disaster-stricken areas received not only substantial loans and relief funds but also material support. During the five years, the state allocated over 100 billion jin of grain to disaster areas alone. After receiving state assistance, their production and lives were guaranteed, and basically no land was abandoned.

During the First Five-Year Plan, tractor stations were established from scratch. The state has built more than 350 tractor stations, with a total of more than 10,900 tractors (standard units). The tractors in these stations cultivated land for the agricultural cooperatives, which not only solved the problem of labor and animal power shortages in the cooperatives but also cultivated the land deeply and finely, playing a certain role in ensuring increased production in the agricultural cooperatives. During the same period, the state's supply of production materials to farmers also increased significantly. For example, with the total value of production materials supplied in 1952 indexed to 100, the figure for 1957 increased to over 275. Among these, the supply of chemical fertilizers increased by more than 4.5 times, pesticides increased by more than 8 times, pesticide application machinery increased by more than 2.5 times, and double-wheel double (single) share plows increased by more than 40 times. According to calculations by the Ministry of Agriculture, due to the use of pesticides to prevent and control cotton diseases and insect pests, 4.04 million dan of ginned cotton (i.e., the portion of production prevented from being reduced by disasters) was protected in the five years, which can meet the needs of 1.35 million spindles for one year of spinning.

Rational tax and price policies are important measures taken by the state to develop agricultural production. Because the agricultural tax rate remained unchanged while agricultural production gradually increased, the proportion of public grain paid by farmers to the state in the total grain output decreased year by year during the First Five-Year Plan, falling by 1.4% in 1956 compared to 1952. In terms of agricultural product procurement, in addition to issuing a large amount of advance purchase deposits every year to support agricultural production, the prices of some agricultural products were also appropriately increased. Taking grain as an example, the national average purchase price in 1956 increased by 12.9% compared to 1952, while the retail prices of some production materials decreased year by year.

Over the past five years, the state has done a lot of work in improving agricultural technology. A nationwide agricultural experiment, demonstration, and agricultural technology extension network has been formed. There are now 211 agricultural scientific research institutions and experimental stations nationwide, and 2,053 seed breeding and demonstration farms have been established in special zones and counties (cities). There are more than 14,400 agricultural technology extension stations throughout the country, more than 50 times more than in 1952.

    在第一个五年计划期间
    国家大力支援农业生产
    总支出相当于农业税收的80％以上
    据新华社26日讯　在第一个五年计划期间，国家对农业生产作了巨大的支援。
    包括今年的预计数在内，在这个五年中，国家直接地和间接地用于发展农业生产的支出共达一百二十八亿三千多万元，这笔支出相当于同期农民交纳的农业税的80％以上。国家每年适时地发放农业贷款和灾后救济款，对于发展农业生产和帮助农民战胜灾荒起了很大的作用。例如，在刚刚实现农业合作化的1956年，大批合作社经济基础还比较薄弱，一般都感生产资金不足，为了帮助合作社克服这个困难，搞好当年的生产，在强调勤俭办社的前提下，国家发放了三十一亿元贷款，支持它们兴修了农田水利工程，添置了很多生产资料。受灾地区的农民除得到大量贷款和救济款以外，还得到了物资方面的支持，五年中国家仅调拨给灾区的粮食就有一千多亿斤。他们得到国家援助后，生产生活上都有了保障，基本上没有荒弃土地。
    在第一个五年计划期间，拖拉机站从无到有，国家已经建成拖拉机站三百五十多处，共有拖拉机一万零九百多台（标准台），这些站的拖拉机为农业社代耕，不仅解决了社的劳力、畜力不足问题，而且耕得深耙得细，在保证农业社的增产上起了一定作用。同一期间，国家供应农民的生产资料也大大增加。如以1952年供应的生产资料总值为一百，1957年增长为二百七十五以上。其中，化学肥料供应数量增加四倍半，农药增加八倍多，药械增加两倍半以上，双轮双（单）铧犁增加四十多倍。据农业部计算，由于使用农药防治了棉花的病虫害，五年中即保产皮棉四百零四万担（即避免因灾减产部分），可供一百三十五万锭子一年纺纱的需要。
    合理的税收政策和价格政策是国家采取的发展农业生产的重要措施。由于农业税率不变而农业又逐步增产，在第一个五年计划期间，农民向国家交纳的公粮占粮食总产量的比重逐年下降，1956年比1952年下降了1.4％。在农产品收购上，每年除发放大量预购定金支持农业生产外，还适当地提高了一部分农产品的价格。以粮食为例，1956年全国平均收购价格比1952年提高了12.9％，而一些生产资料的零售价格却逐年下降。
    五年来，国家在提高农业技术方面做了很多的工作。一个全国规模的农业上的试验、示范和农业技术推广网已经形成。现在全国农业科学研究机构和试验站有了二百十一所，专区和县（市）建立了种籽繁育、示范农场二千零五十三个，全国各地共有农业技术推广站一万四千四百多个，比1952年增加五十多倍。
