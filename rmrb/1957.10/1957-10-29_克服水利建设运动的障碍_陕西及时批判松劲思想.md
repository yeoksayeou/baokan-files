This newspaper Xingping, 27th dispatch: "We must not regard water conservancy construction as a mere means of combating drought, but should see it as a major measure for increasing agricultural production." On the 27th, amidst the sound of continuous rain, Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, pointed out to reporters that this is the ideological problem that must first be solved in Shaanxi's large-scale water conservancy construction movement. To this end, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee will soon issue a notice instructing Party committees at all levels to prevent complacent thinking and resolutely implement the Central Committee's instructions on carrying out water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaigns this winter and next spring. At noon on the 27th, Comrade Zhang Desheng had already set off in the rain to Chang'an and other places to provide specific guidance for this movement. Zhao Shoushan, Governor of the Provincial People's Committee, Vice Governor Xie Huaide and other responsible comrades, will also set off to various places soon.

Since the 24th, rainfall has occurred in various parts of Shaanxi, and the broad masses of peasants are overjoyed. However, the erroneous thinking that "the rain has soaked through, the wheat has been sown well, and the water conservancy movement does not need to be so enthusiastic" has begun to emerge among cadres and the masses. Xingping, Wugong, and other counties have already discovered and criticized this kind of thinking in a timely manner. On the 25th, the Xingping County Party Committee criticized this thinking at a water conservancy meeting attended by township-level cadres. On the night of the 26th, Wang Bin, Secretary of the County Party Committee, summoned responsible comrades from several nearby townships to report on the current water conservancy construction situation, and also reflected that some cooperatives had become complacent after the rain and planned to abandon the planned water conservancy construction projects. Comrade Wang Bin emphasized at this meeting that this kind of complacent thinking is a new obstacle to the current water conservancy movement, and demanded that all townships actively educate the masses to continue to complete and overfulfill the established water conservancy construction plans. The Wugong County Party Committee also took emergency measures to overcome complacent thinking. On the night of the 26th, when it was raining all day, Sun Fusheng, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, called on the peasants of the county through wired broadcasting to immediately engage in a large-scale water conservancy construction movement and resolutely overcome the new right-leaning sentiments generated after the rain.

    克服水利建设运动的障碍
    陕西及时批判松劲思想
    本报兴平27日电　“不能把水利建设当成单纯的抗旱手段，应看作是农业增产的主要措施”，27日，陕西省委第一书记张德生同志在大雨连绵声中向记者指出，这是陕西地区开展大规模水利建设运动必须首先解决的思想问题。为此，陕西省委即将发出通知，指示各级党委防止松劲思想，坚决贯彻中央关于在今冬明春开展水利建设和积肥运动的指示。27日中午，张德生同志已冒雨出发，到长安等地具体指导这一运动，省人民委员会赵寿山省长、谢怀德副省长等负责同志，也即将出发各地。
    从24日起，陕西各地陆续降雨，广大农民欢欣鼓舞。但是，“雨下透了，麦种好了，水利运动不必那样热火了”的错误思想，又在干部和群众中开始露头。兴平、武功等县已经及时发现和批判了这种思想。25日，兴平县委在召开的有乡级干部参加的水利会议上，批判了这种思想。26日夜，该县县委书记王彬召集附近几个乡的负责同志汇报当前水利建设的情况，也反映了有一些合作社在雨后产生了松劲思想，打算放弃已经做好的水利建设计划。王彬同志在这个会上强调指出这种松劲思想是当前开展水利运动的新障碍，要求各乡积极教育群众，继续完成和超额完成已定的水利建设计划。武功县委对于克服松劲思想也采取了紧急措施。在整天下雨的26日夜晚，县委副书记孙福生通过有线广播号召全县农民立即投入大规模的兴修水利运动，坚决克服雨后产生的新的右倾情绪。
