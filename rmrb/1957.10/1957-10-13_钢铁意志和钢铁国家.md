　　From a Small Blast Furnace to a Multitude of Furnaces

　　Whether on the banks of the Dnieper River or in the foothills of the Ural Mountains, whether in the Donbass coal region or on the steppes of Siberia and Kazakhstan, one can see steel factories scattered like stars. Their towering blast furnace clusters stretch towards the sky, the open-hearth furnace fires glow red day and night, and automated rolling mills churn out piles of steel. Seeing this magnificent scene cannot help but be exciting. More steel factories mean faster growth in steel production. In 1956, the Soviet Union produced 48.6 million tons of steel and 35.8 million tons of pig iron, a clear sign of the Soviet Union's industrial development and national strength. Today, the Soviet Union is an undeniable steel nation.

　　Perhaps old Russia left behind a rich legacy in the steel industry? No. Although Russia produced 4.2 million tons each of steel and iron in 1913, it left behind almost no trace of steel production when the October Revolution was won. Some remember that in the winter of 1919, railway traffic across the country came to a standstill because one in every two locomotives needed repair, and steel was extremely scarce. Only one small blast furnace in Yenakiyevo was working across the entire nation. In 1920, the country produced only 200,000 tons of steel and 100,000 tons of pig iron. Therefore, the Soviet Union's becoming a powerful steel nation today is entirely due to the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, achieving it through forty years of arduous effort with a steel-like will.

　　"The Soviet Union should become a steel nation," this slogan was put forward shortly after the October Revolution. At the Fourteenth Congress of the Bolshevik Party in 1925, Dzerzhinsky, Chairman of the National Economic Council, said: "How can the Russia of workers and peasants not be a steel nation? Only on the basis of steel can we defend our country and firmly maintain the fruits of the October Revolution." At the time, not everyone supported this slogan. Some believed that there would be no place to use the steel produced; others believed that the plan to build steel factories was a fantasy because there were neither enough technicians nor the ability to manufacture equipment. But the Soviet people believed the words of the Communist Party and followed the path it pointed out.

　　How was this path traversed? Pavel Ivanovich Korobov, who spent many years in steel factories, recalled the changes of forty years. Korobov was the eldest son of a blast furnace worker in Donbass. He had two younger brothers and a younger sister. If they had grown up under the capitalist system, they would have at most lived a life of destitution like their predecessors. But under the cultivation of socialist society, Korobov and his second brother became Vice-Chairmen of the Soviet State Technical Committee and the State Construction Committee, his third brother became the director of a steel factory, and his sister became an actress. Korobov is also a Hero of Socialist Labor, and his second brother is also a Deputy Doctor. Korobov's wife is a blast furnace expert and teaches at the Steel Institute. Their later generations, except for Korobov's son who studied architecture, his second brother's son is already a blast furnace engineer, and his third brother's son is also attending the blast furnace department of the Steel Institute. The Korobov family has an indissoluble bond with blast furnaces, so it is no wonder that when he talks about steel factories and the steel industry, it is as if he is talking about his closest friends, as if he is talking about a lifelong aspiration, willing to go through fire and water for every inch of growth in this cause.

　　"When the furnace fire first burned red..."

　　Korobov's feelings for steel were sown from an early age. His grandfather was a blast furnace worker. His father had worked in the blast furnace workshop since he was thirteen years old and later became a famous blast furnace foreman. He was elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and passed away a few years ago. The Makayevka steel factory in Donbass, where his grandfather and father worked, belonged to French capitalists before the revolution, and later it was jointly run by French and Russian capitalists. Before the revolution, the steel industry was mainly in the south, and the steel factories all belonged to foreign capital. Korobov's father only studied for two years, and his illiterate mother could only identify money by color and size. Their greatest wish was for their children to be educated. Korobov entered a pre-revolutionary middle school. At that time, he was the only child of a worker in the school.

　　Korobov finished middle school in the Soviet era. He also came to work at the Makayevka factory. This was precisely the period after the civil war when industry was in ruins. Many workers had scattered to the countryside, and only the most determined backbone workers remained in the factory. The little food ration they received was not enough to support them, so they also grew vegetables, raised sheep, and raised pigs. A rampant typhoid epidemic took the lives of many of their comrades. However, hunger and plague did not dishearten the working class. They never gave up the idea of restoring the factory. As soon as the war ended, the backbone workers in various places began preparing even before instructions from the central government arrived. They used old materials to repair machinery and equipment. This is how the blast furnace at the Makayevka steel factory was repaired.

　　Korobov said: "When the furnace fire first burned red, the workers were extremely happy, because a new life that the whole country had been looking forward to had begun."

　　The factory sent the twenty-year-old Korobov to a Moscow higher education institution to study. In 1926, he graduated as an engineer and returned to the Makayevka steel factory, where he began working in the blast furnace workshop. In this way, he and his father threw themselves into the boiling construction life together. At this time, Donbass already had five years of consolidated Soviet power. The machines at the Makayevka steel factory were being restored one by one, and the design and construction of new furnaces began. The Soviet regime could accumulate new strength. Life still had many difficulties; these were difficulties on the road to progress. This was even more apparent.

　　As the people of Donbass saw off 1928, Korobov was transferred to the Yenakiyevo steel factory. At this factory, he learned everything about taking care of blast furnaces and developed an unchanging love for them. He encountered so many difficulties during this period that he felt that nothing could stump him again. Five years later, the workshop led by Korobov was rebuilt, and cadres were trained, becoming an excellent collective for smelting pig iron. Ordzhonikidze, the People's Commissar of Heavy Industry of the Soviet Union, who often came to inspect, valued him very much and finally transferred him to Dnepropetrovsk to support the backward blast furnace workshop of the Petrovsky steel factory. Under Korobov's leadership, the backward situation of the blast furnace workshop changed, and the production of pig iron greatly increased. Due to his outstanding contribution to socialist construction, he was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1934 and admitted to the Party.

　　Recalling the Hard Days of the Initial Construction

　　This was precisely the period of the Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan. The Soviet Union rebuilt the steel factories in the south and built many new steel factories in the east and south, such as Magnitogorsk, Kuznetsk, Novotagilsk, Amur, Azov, Zaporozhye, and so on. A high tide of socialist construction surged across the country. Many young people volunteered to go to the Urals and Siberia to participate in construction, and many outstanding steel workers were sent to manage new-style machines. The world-renowned Magnitogorsk steel factory was built in an uninhabited area in the southern Urals. There, one village was forty to fifty kilometers away from another, construction workers came from afar, lived in tents, and had to endure blizzards and minus forty degrees Celsius in winter. At that time, it mainly relied on the workers' enthusiasm and hands; there was little mechanization. Furnace equipment and even refractory bricks had to be bought from foreign countries until refractory bricks could be made domestically when the last few furnaces were being built. The first batch of blast furnaces was purchased from the United States and Germany with gold. Magnitogorsk's first blast furnace was prepared to be put into production in January 1932, but the American consultant Hevin opposed it, insisting that according to American experience, construction could not start in winter. Later, the People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry consulted the experts and approved the start of the blast furnace.

　　At the end of 1935, Korobov was again transferred to the Magnitogorsk steel factory as the factory director. This factory and its equipment were all brand new, but the production situation was not very good. Korobov encountered the same life as he had in the Yenakiyevo steel factory. He spent a lot of energy to strengthen labor discipline and increase the workers' productive mood. After working in Magnitogorsk for two years, he was transferred to the People's Commissariat of the Soviet steel industry. In 1939, he was appointed as the First Deputy Minister of the People's Commissariat of the Soviet steel industry. He maintained close relations with Magnitogorsk, directly leading it in the ministry, and went down to the factory as the factory director for half a year during the war.

　　The Soviet Patriotic War proved the Soviet Communist Party's foresight in developing the steel industry in the east. But in this period of extreme need for steel, only one-third of the Soviet Union's total steel industry was in the Urals, and labor was also very scarce. What to do? It was necessary to further improve operating techniques, transform old equipment, and build new factories. The scene of the workers working day and night to produce for the front line and for victory would move anyone who saw it. At the Novotagil steel factory, the rolling mill was installed in two months, which normally took a year to do. Korobov said: "Once, I walked into a workshop and saw some teenagers. I asked one of them how old he was? He said fourteen years old. The foreman was also a teenager. He mastered the technology better than his companions, so he replaced the adults as foreman. Not long ago, I met an old worker from this factory and asked about the situation of this teenage foreman. He is already nearly thirty years old and has become a father." During the war, everyone who could work, from big to small, spared no effort to dedicate all their strength in order to produce more steel.

　　In the Future, There Will Be Many More Steel Centers

　　In 1948, the Soviet Union's steel production recovered to the pre-war level. In the last ten years, the Soviet Union's steel production has increased nearly three times. Now the annual steel production increases by 3.5 million tons, and pig iron production increases by about 3 million tons. But the most encouraging thing is the development prospects of the Soviet steel industry in the next fifteen years. Korobov is very familiar with this prospect, and he talks about it like counting his family treasures.

　　The main direction of the Soviet steel industry in the next fifteen years is to build new factories, and existing steel factories will be expanded. Spread out the Soviet map and look from west to east. In the south, basically no new factories will be built, but many factories on the banks of the Donbass and the Dnieper River will add blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and other equipment. A new steel factory will be built in Kerch. In the Belgorod region (between Kharkov and Kursk), which is rich in iron ore, probably more than one huge steel factory will be built. The Cherepovets steel factory (in the Vologda Oblast, east of Leningrad) will be fully completed during the next five-year plan period. Many steel factories in the Urals will be greatly expanded, and the Magnitogorsk steel factory will be expanded to produce 13 million tons of steel per year. The Orsk-Khalilovo steel factory in the southern Urals will be completed. The Karaganda steel factory in Kazakhstan will be expanded. Three huge steel factories will be built in the Sokolov-Sarbai coal and iron region of the Kostanay Oblast. In western Siberia, a large-scale steel factory like Kuznetsk will begin construction this year. Two steel factories will be built in eastern Siberia. The Amur steel factory may be expanded. In these newly built and expanded factories, there will be blast furnaces with a volume of 2,300 cubic meters, 500-ton open-hearth furnaces, 180-ton electric furnaces, rolling mills that roll at 60 meters per second, and plate mills that roll at 30 meters per second... How many steel centers will appear on Soviet territory, truly an enchanting prospect!

　　The Soviet Union, with its abundant mineral resources, excellent talents, and strong capital, has grown into one of the world's leading steel nations in forty years. In recent years, its absolute increase in steel production has surpassed that of the United States. Its steel industry, like the young socialist system, has infinitely broad prospects.

　　钢铁意志和钢铁国家
　　本报记者　李何
    从一座小高炉到高炉成群
    不论在第聂伯河畔还是在乌拉尔山麓，不论在顿巴斯煤区还是在西伯利亚、哈萨克斯坦草原，都可以望见星罗棋布的钢铁工厂。它们的魁梧的高炉群体伸向天空，平炉炉火昼夜通红，自动化轧钢机滚滚地轧出成堆的钢材。看到这种雄伟壮阔的气象，不能不兴奋。钢铁工厂多，钢铁生产增长得就快，1956年苏联产钢四千八百六十万吨、产生铁三千五百八十万吨，这是苏联工业发达和国家富强的一个鲜明标志。今天苏联是一个谁也否认不了的钢铁国家。
    也许旧日俄国在钢铁工业方面留下了什么丰富的遗产吧？不。俄国虽然在1913年出产了钢铁各四百二十万吨，但在十月革命才胜利时，差不多没有留下什么钢铁生产的影子。有人记得，在1919年冬天，各地铁路交通都停顿下来，原因是每两部火车头中有一部需要修理，而钢铁又非常缺乏，全国只有叶纳基也沃的一座小型高炉开着工。1920年全国只生产了二十万吨钢和十万吨生铁。所以，今天苏联之成为强大的钢铁国家，完完全全是苏联人民在苏联共产党领导之下，怀着钢铁般的意志，经过四十年千辛万苦的努力而取得的。
    “苏联应该成为钢铁国家”，这个口号在十月革命以后不久就提出来了。在1925年布尔什维克党第十四次代表会议上，国民经济委员会主席捷尔津斯基说：“工农的俄国岂能成为非钢铁的国家？只有在钢铁的基础上才能卫护我们的国家和牢固地保持十月革命的果实。”当时并不是所有的人都支持这个口号的。有人认为，钢铁生产了没有地方用；有人认为，既没有足够的技术人员，又不能制造设备，建设钢铁工厂的计划岂不是空想。但是苏联人民相信共产党的话，走了共产党所指引的道路。
    这条路是怎样走过来的呢？在钢铁工厂度过了许多岁月的巴维尔·伊凡诺维奇·科罗波夫，向我回忆了四十年的变迁。科罗波夫是顿巴斯一位高炉工人的长子，他有两个弟弟和一个妹妹。他们如果生长在资本主义制度下，最多不过像他们的前辈一样潦倒一生罢了。但在社会主义社会的培养下，科罗波夫和他的二弟成为苏联国家技术委员会和国家建筑委员会的副主席，三弟成为钢铁工厂的厂长，妹妹成为演员。科罗波夫还是社会主义劳动英雄，他的二弟还是副博士。科罗波夫的妻子是高炉专家，在钢铁学院任教。他们的后一辈，除了科罗波夫的儿子学的是建筑以外，他的二弟的儿子已经是高炉工程师，三弟的儿子进的也是钢铁学院的高炉系。科罗波夫全家和高炉结下了不解之缘，无怪乎当他谈起钢铁工厂和钢铁工业的时候，就好像谈起他的最亲近的朋友，好像谈起一种毕生向往的事业，为着这种事业的每一寸成长，赴汤蹈火在所不辞。
    “当炉火第一次烧红了的时候……”
    科罗波夫对钢铁的情谊从小就种下了。他的祖父是高炉工人。他的父亲从十三岁起就在高炉车间工作，后来成为有名的高炉工长，被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表，前几年才过世。他的祖父和父亲所工作过的顿巴斯的马卡耶夫卡钢铁工厂，在革命前属于法国资本家，后来由法国与俄国的资本家合办。革命前钢铁工业主要在南方，钢铁工厂都属于外国资本。科罗波夫的父亲只念过两年书，而不识字的母亲只能凭颜色和大小来识别钱钞，他们的最大的心愿是要自己的孩子们有文化。科罗波夫进了旧制中学。当时在这个学校里只有他一个人是工人的子弟。
    到苏维埃时代，科罗波夫才念完中学。他也来到马卡耶夫卡工厂做工。这正是国内战争之后工业残破不堪的时期。许多工人四散到乡下去了，工厂里只剩下了最坚定的骨干工人。一点点口粮不够养活他们，他们也种菜、喂羊、养猪。流行猖獗的伤寒病夺去了他们的不少伙伴。但是，饥饿和瘟疫没有使工人阶级灰心。他们没有一刻放弃恢复工厂的念头。战争一结束，各地骨干工人不等中央的指示来到，已经动手准备了。他们利用旧物资修理了机器设备。马卡耶夫卡钢铁工厂的高炉也是这样修理好了。
    科罗波夫说：“当炉火第一次烧红了的时候，工人们高兴极了，因为全国盼望的新生活开始了”。
    工厂保送二十岁的科罗波夫到了莫斯科高等学校学习。1926年，他学成工程师，回到马卡耶夫卡钢铁工厂，开始在高炉车间工作。这样，他和他的父亲一起投入沸腾的建设生活中去了。这时，顿巴斯已经有五年巩固的苏维埃政权，马卡耶夫卡钢铁工厂的机器一个个恢复起来，新炉子的设计和建设开始了。苏维埃政权可以积蓄新的力量了。生活还有重重困难，这是前进路途上的困难。这一点已更加明显了。
    当顿巴斯人们送走了1928年时，科罗波夫被调到叶纳基也沃钢铁工厂。他在这个工厂学会了照料高炉的一切，产生了对高炉永远不变的喜爱。他在这个时期遇到了这样多困难，以至觉得此后再没有事情可以难倒他了。过了五年，科罗波夫所领导的车间改建了，干部也培养出来了，成为了冶炼生铁的出色集体。常来视察的苏联重工业人民委员奥尔忠尼启则很器重他，终于把他调去第聂伯彼得罗夫斯克支援彼得罗夫斯基钢铁工厂的落后高炉车间。在科罗波夫的领导下，高炉车间落后的情况改变了，生铁产量大大增加了。由于对社会主义建设的出色贡献，他在1934年被奖给列宁勋章，并被吸收入党。
    回忆建设初期艰苦的日子
    这正是苏联第一个五年计划时期。苏联改建了南方的钢铁工厂，并且在东方和南方建设了许多新的钢铁工厂，像马格尼托哥尔斯克、库兹涅次克、诺沃塔吉尔斯克、阿穆尔、阿速夫、查坡罗什等等钢铁工厂。全国涌起了社会主义建设的高潮。许多青年自愿到乌拉尔和西伯利亚去参加建设，许多优秀的钢铁工人被派去管理新式机器。世界闻名的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁工厂是在乌拉尔南部漠无人烟的地方建设起来的。那里一个乡村和另一个乡村相隔四五十公里，建筑工人来自远方，住在帐篷里，冬天要经受暴风雪和零下四十度的严寒。当时主要靠工人的热情和双手，没有什么机械化。炉子设备以至耐火砖都要从外国买进来，直到建造最后几个炉子时才能自制耐火砖。第一批高炉是用金子向美国和德国购买来的。马格尼托哥尔斯克第一座高炉在1932年1月准备投入生产，但是美国顾问赫文反对，坚持根据美国经验，在冬天不能开工。后来重工业人民委员部征询了专家们的意见，批准了高炉的开工。
    在1935年底，科罗波夫又被调到马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁工厂当厂长。这个工厂和设备都是崭新的，但生产情况不很好。科罗波夫又遇到在叶纳基也沃钢铁工厂时那样的生活。他又花了许多精力来巩固劳动纪律和提高工人的生产情绪。他在马格尼托哥尔斯克工作两年以后被调到了苏联钢铁工业人民委员部，1939年被任命为苏联钢铁工业人民委员部第一副部长。他和马格尼托哥尔斯克保持了密切的关系，在部里直接领导它，在战时又下到这个工厂当了半年厂长。
    苏联卫国战争证明苏联共产党在东部发展钢铁工业的远见。但是在这极端需要钢铁的时期，在乌拉尔只有苏联全部钢铁工业的三分之一，劳动力也非常缺乏。怎么办呢？必须进一步提高操作技术，改造旧设备，建设新工厂。工人们废寝忘食地为前线为胜利生产的情景，任何人看到都会感动。在诺沃塔吉尔钢铁工厂，两个月便安装好了轧铁机，而平常要一年才能做到。科罗波夫说：“有一次，我走进一个车间，见到一些少年。我问其中一个多少岁？他说十四岁。工长也是个少年。他比同伴们更好地掌握了技术，所以代替了成年人当工长。不久以前，我碰到一位从这个工厂来的老工人，打听了一下这个少年工长的情况。他已经近三十岁，作了父亲了”。在战时，从大到小，凡能劳动的，谁也不惜献出自己的一切力量，为了多生产钢铁。
    将来，还要有许多钢铁中心
    1948年，苏联钢铁的产量恢复到了战前水平。在最近十年中，苏联钢铁产量增长了将近三倍。现在每年钢产量增长三百五十万吨，生铁产量增长约三百万吨。然而最令人鼓舞的是苏联钢铁工业今后十五年的发展远景。科罗波夫对这个远景非常熟悉，讲起来如数家珍。
    苏联钢铁工业今后十五年的主要方向是建设新厂，现有钢铁工厂将加以扩建。展开苏联地图从西往东看。在南方基本上将不建设新厂，但顿巴斯和第聂伯河两岸的许多工厂将增添高炉、平炉等等设备。在刻赤将建设新的钢铁工厂。在铁矿丰富的别尔哥罗德地区（在哈尔科夫与库尔斯克之间）大概将建设不只一个巨大的钢铁工厂。切列波维次钢铁工厂（在列宁格勒以东沃洛格达州）在下一个五年计划期内将全部建成。乌拉尔许多钢铁工厂将大大扩建，马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁工厂将扩大到每年出产一千三百万吨钢。乌拉尔南部奥尔斯克—哈里洛沃钢铁工厂将要建成。哈萨克斯坦的卡拉干达钢铁工厂将扩建。在库斯坦奈州的索科洛夫—萨尔巴伊煤铁地区将建设三座巨大的钢铁工厂。在西伯利亚西部，像库兹涅次克那样大型钢铁工厂今年将开始建设。在西伯利亚东部将建设两座钢铁工厂。阿穆尔钢铁工厂可能扩建。在这些新建和扩建的工厂里将出现容积为二千三百立方公尺的高炉，五百吨的平炉，一百八十吨的电炉，每秒压延六十公尺的轧钢机，每秒压延三十公尺的轧板机……。在苏联领土上将出现多少个钢铁中心啊，真是迷人的远景！
    拥有丰富的矿源、优秀的人材、雄厚的资力的苏联，在四十年中成长为世界上有数的钢铁国家，最近几年它的钢铁的绝对增产量已经超过美国，它的钢铁工业正如年青的社会主义制度一样有着无限广阔的前途。
