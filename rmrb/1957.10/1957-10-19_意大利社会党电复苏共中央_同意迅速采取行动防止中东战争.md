　　Italian Socialist Party Replies to the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee
    Agrees to Take Swift Action to Prevent Middle East War
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: TASS, Rome: "Avanti!" published on the 17th a telegram from the leadership of the Italian Socialist Party to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The telegram states, "The events currently unfolding around Syria cause us to share your concern that an armed conflict in the Middle East could lead to a world war. It is therefore necessary to take swift measures to prevent the danger. We have in the past, and will in the future, stand with the Syrian Socialist Party in demanding that Syria have the right to unite with the people and nations of the Middle East in pursuing a neutral policy."
    The telegram points out that previously, "Italian socialists exposed the dangers of the Eisenhower Doctrine and any other policies aimed at dividing Arab countries and turning them into tools of military blocs. We have in the past, and continue to demand that the United Nations implement policies that can guarantee the security of Middle Eastern countries. We believe that countries concerned with peace in the Mediterranean region should, as the Soviet Union has suggested, undertake the obligation to insist that disputes in the Near and Middle East must only be resolved by peaceful means, and that foreign countries should not interfere in this region or any other part of the world."
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in its telegram to the British and Norwegian Labor Parties on the situation in the Near and Middle East, also sent similar letters to the leadership organs of the Socialist Parties in France, Italy, West Germany, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

　　意大利社会党电复苏共中央
    同意迅速采取行动防止中东战争
    据新华社18日讯  据塔斯社罗马讯：“前进报”17日刊载了意大利社会党领导复苏联共产党中央的电报。电报中说，“目前叙利亚周围发生的事件促使我们和你们一样地担心中东武装冲突会导致世界大战。因此有必要迅速采取措施来防止危险。我们过去和将来都同叙利亚社会党一道，要求让叙利亚有权同中东的人民和国家团结在一起执行中立政策。”
    电报指出，以前“意大利社会党人就揭露了艾森豪威尔主义和任何其他旨在分裂阿拉伯国家、并把它们变为军事集团工具的政策都是很危险的。我们过去和现在都要求联合国执行能够保障中东国家安全的政策。我们认为，关心地中海区域和平的国家，应当像苏联建议那样，承担义务坚持必须只能用和平方法解决中近东争执问题，外国不应该对这个地区或者世界上任何其他地区进行任何干涉。”
    苏联共产党中央委员会在就中近东局势问题致电英国和挪威工党的同时，也给法国、意大利、西德、丹麦、比利时、荷兰各国社会党领导机关类似内容的信件。
