Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 26th - The farmland water conservancy construction movement in Henan Province has fully unfolded amidst the fight against drought and the planting of wheat. During the recent period of fighting drought and planting wheat, the province expanded its irrigated area by five million mu.

Currently, over fifteen million organized peasants in Henan's rural areas, with the spirit of moving mountains and filling seas, are excavating all possible water sources through methods of everyone contributing ideas and every household making suggestions. The province has dug 150,000 new wells and repaired 130,000 old wells. With unwavering spirit, the masses are drilling through mountains, building bridges over gullies, and renovating over 12,000 canals. In Mayuan Township, Yuanyang County, over 7,000 mu of dry land could not be planted with wheat. The CCP Township Branch organized over 6,000 young and strong commune members to work continuously for five days and nights, opening a 45-li-long canal. This canal crossed 15 sand ridges, diverting the Yellow River water to the fields, irrigating over 6,000 mu. In mountainous and hilly areas lacking water sources, people are also breaking conventions to carry out water conservancy construction. In Wuliang Township Agricultural Cooperative, Yuxian County, many believed that mountainous areas lacked water sources and could not resist drought. Party Branch Secretary Hu Xi led everyone to search for water sources in the mountains. After a day's search, they found 17 springs of varying sizes, irrigating over 1,000 mu. Dengfeng County, at the foot of Mount Song, proposed "Let the high mountains give way, so that the river water can ascend the mountain." Shaolin Township, near the Shaolin Temple famous for its martial arts, dug a ditch in two days and two nights, diverting the stagnant water of Wulongtan to irrigate 100 mu of land. The masses said, "The Communist Party has clever methods; the thousand-year-old Dragon Pool has come out of the mountain; from now on, dry land will become paddy fields."

Workers and office cadres are actively helping peasants fight drought and develop water conservancy. Workers in Luoyang City used 38 water pumps to help peasants fight drought in the most difficult areas. They extended the pump hoses into the Luo River and Jian River, pumping water up to Mount Mang section by section. Cadres of directly subordinate organizations in Nanyang Prefecture used three portable steam engines to divert the Bai River water to Wolonggang, irrigating 1,600 mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th - The deeds of Zhaogang Township, Guanghua County, Hubei Province, in frugally constructing water conservancy projects have been praised by the Yichang Prefecture and Xiangyang Prefecture water conservancy visiting delegations that recently visited Zhaogang Township for study.

From early December last year to May this year, the eleven agricultural cooperatives in Zhaogang Township used only 400 yuan to build 34 river dams and flood control dams, 6 mountain canals (total length of 57 and a half li), and one overflow dam. In addition, they built 22 water storage dams along the canals, and repaired 4 old dams, forming a water conservancy network throughout the township. These projects can convert more than 5,400 mu of dry land into paddy fields. This year, each agricultural cooperative, based on its labor force, has converted 1,862 mu of dry land into paddy fields, yielding more than 310,000 jin of extra grain.

Five small rivers flow through Zhaogang Township, and there are many small hills, gullies, and stones, which are suitable for building small-scale projects such as river dams and diversion canals. However, last winter, many cadres and peasants advocated borrowing large amounts of money from the government to build so-called decent water conservancy projects such as large overflow dams made of concrete. The Qingquan, Yongjiu, and Yongyuan cooperatives alone planned to borrow 15,000 yuan from the state to build two overflow dams and a reservoir. In order to reverse this erroneous practice that violated the principle of frugality, the higher-level leading organs and the CCP branch of this township, on the one hand, carried out criticism, and on the other hand, organized cadres from the eleven agricultural cooperatives and many commune members to view the favorable terrain suitable for building water conservancy projects. They found cost-effective and high-impact construction methods, and visited a river dam in the township that was built a hundred years ago with stones on both sides and earth in the middle. They also held meetings to summarize the experience of frugally constructing water conservancy projects in the past, and manufactured some equipment for water conservancy construction themselves. After these efforts, those who originally advocated borrowing money to build water conservancy projects changed their minds, and a high tide of building small-scale water conservancy projects quickly swept the township.

    河南省农民以移山填海精神挖掘水源
    抗旱种麦水利建设齐头并进
    湖北赵岗乡勤俭修水利
    新华社郑州26日电　河南省的农田水利建设运动，在抗旱种麦中已经全面展开。在最近抗旱种麦期间，全省扩大了灌溉面积五百万亩。
    目前，河南省农村一千五百多万有组织的农民，正以移山填海的精神，通过人人献计户户建议的办法，挖掘出一切可以挖掘的水源。全省已打新井十五万眼，修旧井十三万眼。群众以顽强的精神，遇山钻洞、逢沟架桥，整修渠道一万二千多条，原阳县马庄乡，原有七千多亩旱地种不上麦，中共乡支部就组织了六千多个青壮年社员，连续五昼夜，开了四十五里长的渠道，这条渠道翻过十五道沙岗，把黄河水引到地里，浇地六千多亩。水源缺少的山地和丘陵地带，人们也打破惯例进行水利建设。禹县诸侯山区无梁乡农业社，很多人认为山区缺水源无法抗旱，党支部书记胡喜，领导大家分头到山里找水源，经过一天的寻查，找出大小泉眼十七处，浇地一千多亩。嵩山脚下的登封县，提出“让高山让路，使河水上山”。以拳术著名的嵩山少林寺附近的少林乡，两天两夜挖一条沟，把伍龙潭死水，弄出来浇地一百亩。群众说：“共产党办法鲜，千年龙潭出了山，从此旱地变水田”。
    工人和机关干部，积极帮助农民抗旱和开发水利。洛阳市的工人们，用三十八部抽水机，到抗旱最困难的地方帮助农民抗旱，他们把抽水机胶管伸下洛河、涧河，一节一节的把水抽上邙山。南阳专区直属机关干部，用三部锅驼机把白河水引上卧龙岗，浇地一千六百亩。
    新华社武汉26日电　湖北省光化县赵岗乡勤俭兴修水利工程的事迹，受到最近到赵岗乡参观学习的宜昌专区和襄阳专区水利参观团的赞扬。
    赵岗乡的十一个农业社从去年12月初到今年5月，只用了四百元，就修筑了三十四个拦河坝和拦冲堰、六条盘山渠（总长五十七里半）和一个滚水坝，另外还顺着渠道修了二十二个蓄水堰，修补了四个老堰，在全乡构成了一个水利网。这些工程能把五千四百多亩旱地改成水田。今年各农业社根据劳动力情况，已把一千八百六十二亩旱地改为水田，多收了三十一万多斤粮食。
    赵岗乡境内有五条小河流过，而且小山岗多，沟和石头多，适合修筑拦河坝和引水渠等小型工程。但是在去年冬天，却有许多干部和农民主张向政府借大批款，用混凝土修筑大滚水坝等所谓像样的水利工程。仅青泉、永久、永远三个社就计划向国家贷款一万五千元，修筑两个滚水坝和一个水库。为了扭转这种违反勤俭原则的错误做法，上级领导机关和这个乡的中共支部，一面进行批判，一面组织全乡十一个农业社的干部和许多社员，观看了适合兴修水利工程的有利地形，找出了费工少、效果大的兴修办法，并参观了乡里一个一百年以前两边用石头、中间填土修筑起来的拦河坝，又开会总结了过去勤俭兴修水利工程的经验，自己制造了一些兴修水利的器材。经过这些工作，原来主张借款修水利的人改变了主张，全乡很快掀起了兴修小型水利工程的高潮。（附图片）
