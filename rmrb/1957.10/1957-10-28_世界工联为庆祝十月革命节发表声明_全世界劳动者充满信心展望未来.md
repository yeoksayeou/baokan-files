Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 26th: The World Federation of Trade Unions has issued a statement to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

The statement said that working people of all countries are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution with excitement. The October Revolution changed the face of the world and gave new content to the daily struggle of working people for a better life and a new society for mankind. On this festive occasion, the World Federation of Trade Unions extends its deep feelings of friendship and solidarity to the Soviet working people and trade unions.

For the first time, people all over the world have seen the living fact that the working class is using its own strength to build a happy and peaceful future. The Soviet working people have created conditions for the advancing high tide of the international workers' movement and the national liberation movement, and also created conditions for the development of world peace forces.

The statement pointed out that the great victory of the Soviet people over the mortal enemies of the working class, their achievements in economic, social and cultural development, and the Soviet Union's consistent implementation of a peaceful policy for forty years - all this is an inspiring example for the working people of all continents.

The statement went on to say that the Soviet working people and trade unions have won the respect and love of the broad masses of working people in all countries because of their consistent dedication to strengthening the unity between countries and between trade unions.

The attempts of the monopoly capital forces to isolate the Soviet Union have all failed. This is because, for forty years, the working people of all countries have shown increasingly deep feelings of solidarity with their brothers and sisters in the world's first socialist country.

The statement pointed out that the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution not only means respect for the glorious past, but also that the already organized forces of the working people of the world are looking to the future with confidence. The future of the international proletariat has never been as clear as it is today on the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution. While celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, the invincible power of the international workers' movement is showing its might.

    世界工联为庆祝十月革命节发表声明
    全世界劳动者充满信心展望未来
    新华社布拉格26日电　世界工会联合会为庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年发表了一项声明。
    声明说，各国劳动人民怀着兴奋的心情来庆祝伟大的十月革命四十周年。十月革命改变了世界的面貌，并且对劳动人民为争取美好生活和人类新社会的日常斗争赋予了新的内容。世界工联趁这个节日向苏联劳动人民和工会表示友好团结的深厚情谊。
    全世界人民第一次看到了活生生的事实：工人阶级用自己的力量建设幸福、和平的未来。苏联劳动人民为国际工人运动和民族解放运动的一往直前的高潮创造了条件，也为世界和平力量的发展创造了条件。
    声明指出，苏联人民战胜工人阶级的死敌的伟大胜利，他们在经济、社会和文化发展方面的成就，苏联四十年来始终一贯地实行和平政策——所有这一切对各大陆劳动人民来说，是一个富有鼓舞力的范例。
    声明接着说，苏联劳动人民和工会由于一贯致力于加强国与国、工会与工会之间的团结，因而博得了世界各国劳动人民群众对他们的尊敬和爱戴。
    垄断资本势力竭力想孤立苏联的一切企图都失败了，这是因为四十年来世界各国劳动人民对世界上第一个社会主义国家的兄弟姐妹们表现了日益深厚的团结感情。
    声明指出，十月革命四十周年不仅仅意味着对光辉的过去的崇敬，而且全世界劳动人民的已经组织起来的力量在充满信心展望着未来。国际无产阶级的前途从来没有像在十月革命四十周年的今天这样明确。在庆祝十月革命四十周年的时候，国际工人运动不可战胜的力量正显示出它的威力。
