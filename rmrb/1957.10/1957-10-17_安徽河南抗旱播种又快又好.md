Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th: In the drought-resistant wheat sowing, many agricultural cooperatives in Anhui Province are using various methods to ensure the quality of wheat sowing. The Lingguang First Cooperative and Second Cooperative in Suixi County have already planted 300 mu of wheat. Due to the emphasis on sowing quality, the emergence rate has reached more than 80%, and the rest are continuing to emerge.

The main methods these agricultural cooperatives use to ensure quality are intensive cultivation, more watering, and more fertilization to ensure full and strong seedlings. The four agricultural cooperatives in Shengli Township, Dongliu County, rushed to plant more than 800 mu of land, ensuring meticulous cultivation for each plot and applying a lot of base fertilizer, using 10 dan of manure water and 50 dan of fire ash per mu. Each seedling was spot-watered with manure water and then covered with fire ash. The agricultural cooperatives in Yangtian Township, Qingyang County, generally use double plowing and double harrowing, with spot-watering using manure water. The Jinguang Agricultural Cooperative in Yongan Township, Fuyang County, discovered that the sowing quality was not high and immediately adopted six measures, including watering, plowing, harrowing, and sowing simultaneously to ensure sowing quality. Many agricultural cooperatives also attach great importance to technical guidance for sowing. In Huangni Township, Qianshan County, a person familiar with the technology first gave a demonstration of seed mixing, soaking, and strip sowing at a cadre meeting, organizing everyone to visit and learn. In areas where the technology is not proficient and equipment is insufficient in Guoyang County, the county organized mixing teams with agricultural cooperatives as units, carrying medicines and mixing equipment to tour various production teams to mix seeds.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 16th: The progress of autumn sowing to fight drought in Anhui Province has greatly accelerated. According to statistics on the 12th, the province has sown more than 16 million mu of crops such as wheat, barley, rape, and peas, more than three times faster than the sowing progress before the 8th.

Currently, more than 7 million farmers across the province are engaged in the drought-resistant rush-planting campaign every day. Agricultural cooperatives in various places are doing everything possible to find water sources. According to statistics from the Bengbu and Fuyang districts, more than 55,200 old wells have been repaired, 1,400 ditches have been dug, and more than 1,200 water-blocking dams have been built. The Fourth Production Team of the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Dawang Township, Chuxian County, had 36 mu of dry ridge land. The members of this production team connected seven waterwheels to carry water over the ridge to irrigate the land.

At present, more than 50,000 cadres from various agencies, enterprises, and schools throughout the province have gone to the countryside to help farmers participate in the drought-resistant rush-planting. In addition to transferring 547 cadres to agricultural cooperatives for drought-resistant rush-planting, the Huaiyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China also organized six roving inspection teams to go to various places to inspect the quality of autumn sowing.

In the drought-resistant rush-planting, agricultural cooperatives in various places have received a large amount of material and financial support from the state. In addition to the hundreds of water pumps that have been installed by the provincial water conservancy departments for drought-resistant rush-planting, the Huai River Management Committee has also transferred some water pumps to help drought-resistant rush-planting. More than 20,000 horse-drawn water carts stored in local supply and marketing cooperatives are being fully supplied to agricultural cooperatives for drought resistance. The grain departments have also allocated more than 13.2 million jin of barley and wheat seeds.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th: Henan Province attaches importance to quality in the drought-resistant wheat sowing campaign. Before the 12th, the province had sown 47.85 million mu of wheat under difficult conditions such as drought and lack of soil moisture. According to inspections in various places, most of it was both fast and good. However, in some areas with very severe drought, some cadres and masses paid insufficient attention to the quality of wheat sowing in order to save time, a phenomenon which was also corrected in a timely manner. After a recent inspection, the Xuchang Prefectural Commissioner's Office discovered that some farmers were doing rough land preparation, uneven and insufficient irrigation, and not paying attention to sowing techniques. It immediately issued instructions requiring agricultural cooperatives to strictly implement the sowing technical operating procedures, demanding re-sowing and interplanting in areas with severe seedling deficiencies, and checking and replanting seedlings in areas with general seedling deficiencies. In order to ensure the quality of wheat sowing, Mengjin, Luoning and other counties in the western Henan mountainous area have universally promoted the sowing experience of fixed personnel, land plots, work points, livestock, time, and quality standards. Agricultural cooperatives in Kaifeng County have universally inspected the wheat fields that emerged early and taken measures such as watering and spot planting and replanting to ensure full emergence.

Various places attach great importance to land leveling and furrowing in the drought-resistant wheat sowing campaign. This is an important aspect of improving the quality of wheat sowing and wheat field irrigation. At the beginning of wheat sowing, Xinxiang, Anyang, Shangqiu, Nanyang, and other districts all formulated land leveling and furrowing plans or programs and implemented them. These areas' agricultural cooperatives have generally allocated about 15% of their labor force to participate in land leveling and furrowing work in conjunction with drought-resistant wheat sowing.

Various places in Henan have made preparations. If it does not rain after sowing wheat, they will immediately switch to watering the wheat to ensure that the wheat emerges well and grows vigorously.

　　安徽河南抗旱播种又快又好
    据新华社合肥15日电　在抗旱种麦中，安徽省很多农业社用各种办法保证种麦的质量。濉溪县临光第一社和第二社已种的三百亩小麦，由于重视播种质量，现在出苗率达到80％以上，其余的还在继续出苗。
    这些农业社保证质量的主要办法是精耕细作，多浇水多施肥等，使苗全苗壮。东流县胜利乡四个农业社抢种的八百多亩地，丘丘都做到细耕细作，基肥也施得很多，每亩施十担粪水和五十担火粪。每窝都用水粪点浇，然后用火粪盖好。青阳县杨田乡的各个农业社一般都做到双犁双耙，用水粪点浇。阜阳县永安乡金光农业社发现播种质量不高，立即采取边浇边犁边耙边种等六项办法，保证播种质量。很多农业社也很重视播种的技术指导。潜山县黄泥乡在干部会上先由熟悉技术的人作出拌种、浸种、条播的表演，组织大家参观学习。涡阳县在有些技术不熟练、器械不足的地方，以农业社为单位组织拌和队，携带药剂、拌和器巡回到各生产队去拌种。
    据新华社合肥16日电　安徽省抗旱秋种的进度大大加快。据12日统计，全省已经播种一千六百多万亩小麦、大麦、油菜、豌豆等作物，比8日以前的播种进度加快三倍多。
    目前，全省每天投入抗旱抢种运动的农民有七百多万人。各地农业社想尽一切办法寻找水源。据蚌埠、阜阳两个专区统计，修复旧井五万五千二百多眼，开沟一千四百条，打了一千二百多个拦水坝。滁县大王乡幸福农业社第四生产队有三十六亩缺水的岗地，这个生产队的队员用七道水车接起来把水车过岗去浇地。
    目前，全省各机关、企业、学校下乡帮助农民参加抗旱抢种的干部已达五万多人。中共怀远县委会除抽调五四七个干部到农业社抗旱抢种外，还组织了六个巡回检查组分赴各地检查秋种质量。
    各地农业社在抗旱抢种中，得到了国家大量的物力、财力的支援。除了全省水利部门已经安装好的几百台抽水机用于抗旱抢种以外，治淮委员会也抽调了一部分抽水机帮助抗旱抢种。各地供销社存放的两万多部马拉水车正全部供应农业社抗旱。粮食部门也调拨了大麦、小麦种子一千三百二十多万斤。
    据新华社郑州14日电　河南省在抗旱种麦运动中重视质量。12日以前，全省在干旱缺墒等困难条件下播种的四千七百八十五万亩小麦，据各地检查，大部分既快又好，其中有些干旱十分严重地区，部分干部、群众因为抢时间，对种麦质量不够注意的现象，也及时得到纠正。许昌专署最近检查发现，部分农民群众整地工作做的粗放，浇地不匀不透，不注意播种技术等情况后，立即发出指示，要求各农业社严格执行播种技术操作手续，对于缺苗严重的要求重种套种，一般缺苗的进行查苗补种。豫西山区孟津、洛宁等县为保证种麦质量，普遍推广了固定人、地块、工分、牲畜、时间和质量标准的播种经验。开封县农业社对早播出苗的麦田普遍进行检查，并采取浇水点种、补种等办法，保证了全苗。
    各地在抗旱种麦运动中对平地整畦工作都很重视。这是提高麦播质量和麦田灌溉的一个重要方面。新乡、安阳、商丘、南阳等专区种麦一开始，都制定了平地整畦方案或计划，并加以实施。这些地区的农业社结合抗旱种麦一般都抽出15％左右的劳力参加平地整畦工作。
    河南各地已做了准备，如种完麦后仍不下雨，接着就转入浇麦，以保证小麦出好长旺。
