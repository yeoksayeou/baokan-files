    At the Banquet Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the Signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement
    Ambassador Rubsang's Speech

    Respected Comrade Zhu De: Respected Comrade Zhou Enlai: Beloved Comrades and Friends: Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
    Today, we are extremely happy to celebrate a precious day with you – the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement. This day unfolds a brand-new page in the history of our two countries' relations. Currently, our country is celebrating this festival in a particularly broad manner.
    The aforementioned agreement is not only the first treaty concluded by the Mongolian and Chinese peoples on an equal footing but also a document of extremely important significance for consolidating and developing the friendly relations between our two fraternal peoples. Our two peoples are fighting for a common goal – building socialism.
    In the past five years, the friendly relations between our two countries have been greatly consolidated. Our economic and cultural cooperation has also been expanding year after year. We sincerely hope that our friendship and cooperation will continue to develop in the future.
    Such friendly relations began to develop in 1949 when the People's government was established in China. The Mongolian People's Republic, with the assistance of the entire fraternal countries headed by the great Soviet Union, is striving to build socialism.
    The Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed in 1952 is being fully implemented. It is of extremely great significance for consolidating the independence of our nation and country and for accelerating the construction of Mongolia.
    In the past period, our great neighbor – the People's Republic of China – has expanded and strengthened its fraternal, selfless, and generous assistance to our country. This assistance plays an important role in the development of our country's productive forces.
    Thanks to the economic assistance of the People's Republic of China and the direct participation of the Chinese working class in the construction of Mongolia, many industrial units are being built and many houses are being constructed in our country. Our country has established a match factory and is building asphalt roads, urban roads, stadiums, and reinforced concrete bridges.
    Currently under construction are a woolen textile factory, a paper mill, a glass factory, a vegetable farm, a brick and tile factory with an annual output of millions of bricks and tiles, a prefabricated wooden house factory, and a thermal power plant. In addition, preparations for some construction projects are underway.
    The trade volume between our two countries in 1957 has increased thirtyfold compared with 1952.
    In recent years, the cooperation between our two countries in culture and science has also been rapidly expanding. This is manifested in: our two countries exchanging scientific achievements and literary works, sending art delegations, sports delegations, and film worker delegations to each other. It is also manifested in: the number of interns sent from our country to China for various professional internships has greatly increased. Chinese skilled workers have given us very valuable help, and they have unreservedly passed on their rich experience and high skills to Mongolian workers.
    The great Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, have given us tremendous assistance. The Mongolian people and the government of the Mongolian People's Republic give high praise to this assistance and are often delighted by it.
    On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, please allow me to express my warm gratitude to you and, through you, to the entire Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China.
    Dear Comrades and Friends, we sincerely hope that the great Chinese people will achieve further victories in their national industrialization and socialist construction.
    Please allow me to propose a toast: to the unbreakable, fraternal friendship between our two peoples, to the future prosperity and development of the People's Republic of China, to the great Chinese people, to the government of the People's Republic of China, and to the health of Comrade Mao Zedong!

    在庆祝中蒙经济及文化合作协定签订五周年宴会上
    鲁布桑大使的讲话尊敬的朱德同志：尊敬的周恩来同志：敬爱的同志们和朋友们：亲爱的女士们和先生们：
    今天我们和你们一同万分高兴地庆祝一个可贵的日子——蒙中经济文化合作协定签订五周年。这一天在我们两国相互关系史上展开了崭新的一页。目前，我国正在特别广泛地庆祝着这一个节日。
    上述的协定不仅是一个蒙中两国人民第一次在平等的基础上所缔结的条约，而且也是为巩固和发展我们两国兄弟人民之间友好关系的一个具有极其重要意义的文件。我们两国人民正在为着一个共同的目标——建设社会主义而奋斗。
    在过去的五年中，我们两国的友好关系得到了极大的巩固。我们之间的经济、文化合作也在一年又一年地扩大了。我们衷心地希望我们的友谊与合作今后还要继续地发展。
    1949年，当中国成立了人民政权的时候，这样友好的关系就开始在发展了。蒙古人民共和国受到了以伟大苏联为首的全体兄弟国家的援助，正在为建设社会主义而努力。
    1952年签订的蒙中经济及文化合作协定正在完满地被执行着。它对巩固我们民族和国家的独立，对加速蒙古的建设具有极其重大的意义。
    在过去的一段时期里，我们伟大的邻邦——中华人民共和国扩大了和加强了对我国兄弟般的、无私的、慷慨的援助。这些援助在我国生产力的发展中起着重要的作用。
    由于中华人民共和国的经济援助和中国工人阶级直接参加了蒙古的建设，在我国正兴建着许多工业单位，修建着许多住房。我国已经建立了火柴厂，并正修筑着沥青公路、市内道路、体育场和建设着钢筋水泥的桥梁。
    目前正在建设中的还有毛纺厂、造纸厂、玻璃厂、蔬菜农场、年产砖瓦数百万块的砖瓦厂、木房屋预制工厂、火力发电厂。此外，还有一些建设项目的准备工作正在进行中。
    我们两国之间1957年的贸易额与1952年相比，已增加了三十倍。
    最近几年来，我们两国文化科学方面的合作也在迅速地扩大。这表现在：我们两国相互交换了科学上的成就和文艺作品，相互派遣了艺术代表团、体育代表团和电影工作者代表团。同时还表现在：从我国派遣到中国进行各种专业实习的实习生人数大大地增加了。中国具有熟练技术的工人给了我们非常宝贵的帮助，他们把自己丰富的经验和高度的技巧毫无保留地传授给了蒙古工人。
    在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下的伟大中国人民和中华人民共和国政府给了我们巨大的援助。对此，我们蒙古人民和蒙古人民共和国政府给予了崇高的评价，并且经常对这一援助感到欢欣。
    值此蒙中经济及文化合作协定签订五周年之际，请允许我向你们并通过你们向全体中国人民和中华人民共和国政府表示热烈的感谢。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，我们衷心希望伟大中国人民在其国家工业化和社会主义的建设事业中获得更进一步的胜利。
    请允许我提议：为我们两国人民之间的牢不可破的、兄弟般的友谊，为中华人民共和国未来的繁荣和发展，为伟大的中国人民，为中华人民共和国政府，为毛泽东同志的健康，干杯！
