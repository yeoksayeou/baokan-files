Introduction to the Soviet Track and Field Team

　　Invited by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the Soviet track and field team, which has come to participate in the National Track and Field Games, is a flower of friendship at this event. They not only bring us the friendship of the Soviet people, but also bring advanced track and field technology, rich theoretical knowledge, and competition experience to our athletes.

　　The Soviet track and field team is led by T.P. Pugachev, Dean of the Leningrad Institute of Physical Culture, and consists of seven outstanding track and field athletes.

　　Soviet high jumper F. Sytkin won first place in high jump at the international track and field competition in Bucharest with a score of 2.08 meters. However, his results have been improving rapidly in the past two months. At the end of August, he won the championship at the All-Soviet Track and Field Games with an outstanding score of 2.09 meters. On September 30, at the Ukrainian Track and Field Championships, he broke the 1956 world record (2.14 meters) held by American athlete Dumas with a score of 2.15 meters, which is 3 centimeters higher than the champion's score at the 16th Olympic Games.

　　Soviet long jump champion I. Ter-Ovanesyan is the son of Aram, the All-Soviet discus champion from twenty-five years ago. He is only nineteen years old this year. This young Ukrainian university student not only has good long jump results (highest score 7.77 meters), but is also an all-around athlete. He won first place at the international track and field competition in Bucharest with a score of 7.56 meters.

　　I. Pipine is a rising star in the Soviet 1,500-meter race. At the third International Youth Games this year, he unexpectedly won first place with an excellent time of 3 minutes 41.1 seconds, surpassing the 16th Olympic champion's time of 3 minutes 41.2 seconds. He won second place in the 800-meter race at the All-Soviet Track and Field Games with a time of 1 minute 50 seconds.

　　Pole vaulter F. Shiratov jumped 4.40 meters at the World Youth Festival competition, winning second place. He also won the championship at the All-Soviet Track and Field Games with an excellent score of 4.50 meters.

　　The Soviet track and field team also includes excellent discus thrower B. Matveyev, whose results are often maintained above 50 meters; sprinter A. Paraskeev, who has completed 100 meters in 10.4 seconds and 200 meters in 21.1 seconds; and E. Sokolov, a rising star in the 1,500-meter and 800-meter races.

　　Soviet track and field athletes are role models for our young track and field athletes to learn from. Through the Sino-Soviet track and field friendship competition, our athletes will learn many valuable techniques and knowledge. (Attached photo)

　　苏联田径队简介
    应国家体育运动委员会邀请，前来参加全国田径运动会的苏联田径队，是这次运动会上一支友谊的花朵。他们不仅给我们带来了苏联人民的友谊，而且给我国运动员带来了先进的田径运动技术，丰富的理论知识和比赛经验。
    苏联田径队由列宁格勒体育学院院长特·普·普加乔夫率领，有七名优秀的田径选手。
    苏联跳高能手弗·西特金在布加勒斯特的国际田径赛中以二公尺零八公分的成绩荣获跳高第一。但是，近两个月来他的成绩日新月异。8月底，他在全苏田径赛中以二公尺零九公分的卓越成绩获得冠军；9月30日，在乌克兰田径锦标赛中，他又以二公尺十五公分的成绩突破了美国运动员杜马斯所保持的1956年世界最高纪录（二公尺十四公分），比十六届奥运会冠军的成绩高出三公分。
    苏联跳远冠军依·捷尔·奥瓦涅襄是二十五年前全苏铁饼冠军阿拉姆的儿子，他今年才十九岁。这位年轻的乌克兰大学生，不仅跳远成绩好（最高成绩七点七七公尺），而且是全能运动员。他在布加勒斯特的国际田径赛中，以七点五六公尺的成绩荣获第一。
    依·皮皮涅是苏联一千五百公尺赛跑的后起之秀。他在今年第三届国际青年运动会上，出人意料之外地以三分四十一秒一的优异成绩获得第一，超过了十六届奥运会冠军三分四十一秒二的成绩。他在八百公尺赛跑中，以一分五十秒的成绩获得全苏田径赛的第二名。
    撑竿跳高能手弗·希拉托夫在世界青年联欢节比赛中，曾跳过四公尺四十公分，荣获第二；在全苏田径赛中，又以四公尺五十公分的优异成绩，而获冠军。
    这次来我国的苏联田径队中，还有优秀的铁饼健将勃·玛特维耶夫，他的成绩经常保持在五十公尺以上；短跑健将阿·帕拉斯克耶夫，他曾以十秒四和二十一秒一的成绩跑完一百公尺和二百公尺；耶·索科洛夫是一千五百公尺和八百公尺赛跑的后起之秀。
    苏联田径运动员是我国年轻的田径选手学习的榜样。通过中苏田径友谊赛，我国运动员将学习到很多可贵的技术和知识。（附图片）
