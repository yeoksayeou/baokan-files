Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: More than fifty scientists in the capital held a symposium on the afternoon of the 13th on the successful launch of the first Soviet artificial Earth satellite.

The eleven scientists who spoke at the meeting unanimously believed that the successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite inaugurated a new era in human science, opening up the path from Earth to the Moon and Mars. It also announced that humanity has not only entered the atomic age, but also the era of space activities.

Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Qian Sanqiang, Secretary-General, believe that the success of the Soviet artificial satellite proves that the Soviet Union's development in many aspects of science and technology has surpassed the United States and has become the world's number one in just forty years. This fact undeniably proves the superiority of the socialist system, and proves that the full development of scientific undertakings is only possible in socialist countries, under the leadership of the Communist Party. Qian Sanqiang said that even American scientists now have to admit this truth.

Zhou Peiyuan, Vice President of Peking University, and Zhao Jiuzhang, Director of the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the Soviet artificial satellite is a bright star raised in the universe by Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers, sending a signal of peace and happiness to the people of the world along its trajectory, and sending a serious warning to the bellicose imperialists.

Many scientists also cited ample data in their speeches to illustrate the brilliant achievements of the Soviet artificial satellite in science and technology. Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that when the international community announced its participation in the International Geophysical Year research project, the United States, as early as July 1955, had released news through the Academy of Sciences and the Science Foundation that it would launch an artificial satellite. In March of this year, the director of the Washington Astrophysical Observatory even wrote a special letter inviting Chinese scientists to participate in the observation of artificial satellites. However, the American artificial satellite has not yet been manufactured. Zhu Kezhen also compared the Soviet artificial satellite with the American one that was announced to be launched, and believed that the Soviet artificial satellite had three advantages: First, the orbit of the Soviet artificial satellite is closer to a circle, and it stays in the air for a longer time. According to the Pravda report, the apogee distance of the Soviet artificial satellite from the Earth is 1,000 kilometers, and although the closest point is not announced, it is estimated to be around 400 to 500 kilometers. The closest point for the United States is 320 kilometers. According to preliminary estimates: the lifespan of a satellite with a closest point of 320 kilometers is only about 40 days; if the closest point is increased to 480 kilometers, the lifespan can be extended to three years. Second, the angle between the orbital plane of the Soviet artificial satellite and the Earth's equatorial plane is 65 degrees, while the American one is 40 degrees. Therefore, the Soviet artificial satellite can be observed over a wider range, and both the temperate and tropical zones in the north and south can be seen. The American one cannot be seen above 40 degrees north and south latitude. Third, the Soviet artificial satellite weighs 83.6 kilograms, while the American one weighs only 10 kilograms. Therefore, the Soviet artificial satellite can carry far more instruments than the American satellite.

Guo Yonghuai, a researcher at the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, calculated based on information he obtained from abroad that the Soviet Union's technology in rockets and automatic control far exceeds that of the United States. He said that the thrust generated by each engine in the first stage rocket used to launch the first Soviet artificial satellite is about 36 tons, while the United States can only achieve 3 to 4 tons of thrust.

At the meeting, many scientists proposed to carry out the observation of artificial satellites quickly, in a planned and organized manner.

Zhang Yuzhe, Director of the Zijinshan Observatory, Chen Zungui, Director of the Beijing Planetarium, and others, also introduced the work of observing artificial satellites at the meeting. Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also announced at the meeting that Qian Wenji, Wu Shuping, Chen Fangyun, Zhang Yuzhe, Guo Yonghuai, Dai Wensai, Chen Zungui and other scientists would immediately organize optical and radio groups to be responsible for organizing the observations.

Zhou Peiyuan, Vice President of Peking University, suggested that scientists should actively and enthusiastically participate in the observation of artificial satellites to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution.

### 苏联人造卫星发射成功  使人类跨进了星空活动时代  首都科学家就人造卫星举行座谈

　　苏联人造卫星发射成功
    使人类跨进了星空活动时代
    首都科学家就人造卫星举行座谈
    新华社13日讯　首都五十多位科学家13日下午就苏联第一颗人造地球卫星发射成功举行座谈会。
    在会上发言的十一位科学家一致认为，苏联人造卫星发射成功，开创了人类科学的新纪元，开辟了从地球走向月球、火星的道路。同时也宣布了我们人类不仅跨进了原子时代，而且跨进了星空活动时代。
    中国科学院副院长吴有训和秘书长钱三强认为，苏联人造卫星发射的成功，证明了苏联在短短四十年间，科学技术许多方面的发展已超过了美国，而跃居世界第一位。这个事实无可争辩地证明了社会主义制度的优越性，证明了科学事业的充分发展，只有在社会主义国家，在共产党领导下才有可能。钱三强说，这一条真理现在就连美国的科学家们也不得不承认。
    北京大学副校长周培源、中国科学院地球物理研究所所长赵九章说，苏联人造卫星是苏联科学家、工程师和工人们在宇宙间升起的一颗明亮的福星，循着它的轨迹向世界人民发出了和平幸福的讯号，向好战的帝国主义者发出了严重的警告。
    许多科学家在发言中还引用了充分的资料，说明苏联人造卫星在科学技术上达到的辉煌成就。中国科学院副院长竺可桢说，国际间宣布参加国际地球物理年研究项目时，美国在1955年7月就曾由科学院和科学基金会发布了要发射人造卫星的消息。今年3月间华盛顿天文物理观象台台长还特地来信要我国科学家参加人造卫星的观测。可是直到现在，美国的人造卫星还没有制造出来。竺可桢又把苏联的人造卫星同美国公布要发射的人造卫星作了对比，认为苏联的人造卫星有三个优点：第一，苏联的人造卫星轨道比较接近圆形，在空中逗留的时间比较长。苏联人造卫星轨道距离地球的近地点，据真理报报道为一千公里，最近地点虽未公布，估计约在四百到五百公里。而美国的最近地点为三百二十公里。据初步估计：近地点为三百二十公里的卫星，它的寿命就只有四十天左右；近地点增加到四百八十公里，则寿命可延长到三年。第二，苏联人造卫星轨道平面与地球赤道平面交角为六十五度，而美国的为四十度。因此，苏联的人造卫星可以观测到的范围比较广，南北温带和热带都可看到。而美国的在南北纬四十度以上就不能看到。第三，苏联人造卫星重量有八十三点六公斤，而美国的只有十公斤。因此，苏联的人造卫星可以携带的仪器比美国卫星多得多。
    中国科学院力学研究所研究员郭永怀根据自己从国外得到的资料计算，认为苏联在火箭和自动控制方面的技术超过美国很远。他说，苏联发射第一颗人造卫星所用的第一段火箭里所用的每个发动机产生的推动力，大约在三十六吨左右，而美国的只能达到三到四吨的推动力。
    会上，不少科学家提出，要迅速地、有计划有组织地进行人造卫星的观测工作。
    紫金山天文台台长张钰哲、北京天文馆馆长陈遵妫等人，在会上还介绍了观测人造卫星的工作情况。中国科学院副院长竺可桢又在会上宣布立即由钱文极、吴叔平、陈芳允、张钰哲、郭永怀、戴文赛、陈遵妫等科学家组织光学和射电两个小组负责组织观测。
    北京大学副校长周培源建议科学家们应当以积极、热情地参加人造卫星的观测工作，来庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年。
