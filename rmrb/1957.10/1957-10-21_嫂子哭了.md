Sister-in-law Cried
    Liu Zhengyi

    The bright gas lamp hung on the big locust tree in the field, surrounded by men, women, old and young, all waiting for my sister-in-law to answer. It was so quiet all around, but my sister-in-law sat in the center, seemingly unconcerned, twisting the corner of her clothes.

    "Speak up! Why don't you want to go down the slope to work?" Aunt Chen couldn't help but speak first.

    "What's there to say? It's not okay to have money to invest? I'm not exploiting you for nothing."

    "Have money? Hmph, sounds just like a landlord."

    "And she's a League member! If everyone were like you, socialism would never be built."

    "So you're saying your dad worked for the landlord his whole life and died of exhaustion, and he wasn't exploited? Wasn't the landlord giving him money too!"

    The last sentence struck at the root of my sister-in-law's problem. Her rosy cheeks suddenly turned a little sallow, and tears welled up in her eyes.

    My sister-in-law suffered a lot when she was young. Her father worked for the landlord and died of exhaustion. Soon after, her mother also passed away, leaving her to live alone. Five years ago, she married my brother. At that time, the young couple lived with great enthusiasm. Going up the slope, they were one in front and one behind. In the field, you chased me, and I chased you. Everyone praised my brother for finding a good wife. Later, my brother joined the workforce and was away from home for years. My sister-in-law slowly changed, no longer willing to go down the slope to work, and no longer as kind to her parents. She was constantly smashing pots and breaking bowls, scolding chickens and cursing dogs. Unable to bear it any longer, my mother bought her a ticket to go to the city to find my brother. Only then did the family become a little more stable.

    Before two months had passed, my sister-in-law suddenly came back, saying that my brother had changed, had bad intentions, and wouldn't let her stay there. As she spoke, she slammed a letter to me. It was my brother's letter. I remember it read something like this:

    "Now is the time to build socialism. The countryside is very short of people. The families here are all moving to the countryside. Why did you let your sister-in-law run to the city?

    In your letters, there's practically nothing else but asking for money. Do I have that much money? This year I bought public bonds. The comrades in the department are all buying eighty to one hundred yuan. I only bought five yuan. Some comrades don't understand and say, 'And he's a League member! His family is even in a high-level cooperative.' Sigh, they don't know that all my money has been invested by you, buying grain to eat…"

    After my sister-in-law came back, she became even lazier than before. If anyone tried to persuade her, she would say, "Aren't I eating yours? Isn't it okay to have money to invest?" The aunts and grandmothers on the street all couldn't stand it anymore and said, "We're so old, and we're still going up the slope to work. How can a young person be staying at home like a maiden in her boudoir!"

    The meeting was quite lively. Some used kind words to persuade my sister-in-law, and some harshly criticized her. Tears kept flowing from my sister-in-law's eyes. The cooperative leader, seeing this situation, said, "Everyone, wait a moment before we continue. Let Su Lan speak again."

    "Aunts and grandmothers! What am I going to say? Everyone is right. I have forgotten my roots and taken the road of landlords and rich peasants exploiting people. From now on… I will only… work hard… going down the slope… let everyone… see for themselves…" She cried and couldn't say anything more.

    The meeting ended, and everywhere in the streets and alleys you could hear:

    "Su Lan can go up the slope this time, and our team has gained another worker!"

    "If all the lazy people come out, our team will definitely be even more excellent, like Li Wenqing's family, Li Wenxuan's family…"

    嫂子哭了
    刘正义
    明亮的汽灯挂在场里的大槐树上，周围坐满了男女老少，都在等待着俺嫂子回答。四周是那么静，俺嫂子仍坐在中央若无其事地捻着她的衣角。
    “你说呀！为啥不愿下坡去干活？”陈大娘憋不住第一个发了言。
    “说什么，有钱投资还不行，又没白剥削你们”。
    “有钱？吓，倒跟地主说的一样了。”
    “还是个团员呢！都照你这样，社会主义就甭建设了。”
    “这么说你爹给地主干一辈子活累死了，也没受剥削，地主不也是给他钱吗！”
    最后的一句话扎着了嫂子的病根子，红红的两颊突然变得有点腊黄，两眼才鼓着泪水。
    俺嫂子从小是个受苦人。父亲给地主干活累死了，不久母亲也去世，落得她自己孤苦伶仃的生活着。五年前她和我哥结了婚，那时小俩口过得真带劲，上坡时一前一后，在地里你追我，我追你，谁不夸我哥摊了个好媳妇。后来我哥参加了工作，成年在外的不回家，俺嫂子才慢慢变了，再不愿下坡干活，对父母也不再那么和气了。整天摔盆子砸碗，指鸡骂狗。实在没办法了，妈才打上车票，让她往城里去找我哥。家里这才安稳了点。
    没待两月，嫂子突然回来了，说我哥哥变了，有了坏心，不让她在那里，说着把一封信叭的摔给了我。俺哥的信，记得是这样写的：
    “现在正是建设社会主义的时候，农村里很缺人，这里的家属都往乡里迁，你们怎么让你嫂子往城里跑？
    你们来信，简直没有点别的事，除了要钱就是要钱。我那里有这么多的钱，今年买公债，科里的同志们都是百儿八十的买，我才买了五元钱。有的同志不了解，就说，还团员呢！家里又入着高级社。咳，他们那里知道我的钱都给你们投了资，买了粮食吃。……”
    嫂子回来后，比以前更懒了，谁若劝她，她就说“不是没吃你的吗，有钱投资还不行？”。街坊上的婶子大娘全看不过去，说：“我们这么大年纪都还上坡干活，年轻轻的倒在家守起闺阁来了！”
    会开得挺热闹，有的用好话劝俺嫂子，有的就狠狠地批评她，俺嫂子眼里不住地流着泪，社长看到这个情景说：“大伙先等会儿谈，再让素兰发发言吧。”
    “婶子大娘们！我说什么呢？大伙说的对，我忘了本，走上了地主富农剥削人的路。我以后……只有好好的……下坡干活……让大伙……看看就是了……”她哭的再也说不下去了。
    散会了，大街胡同里到处可以听到：
    “素兰这回能上坡，咱队又添了个劳动力！”
    “若是懒人都出来，咱队准更呱呱叫，像李文青家，李文轩家……”………
