To promptly resolve problems in work, closely connect with the masses. Xinjiang Many Leading Cadres Go Deep into the Grassroots
　　This newspaper, Urumqi, 20th dispatch. Leading cadres of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have gone deep into grassroots work, strengthening their ties with the masses.
　　Since the start of the rectification campaign, Wu Kaizhang, secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, and Xin Lanting and Yang Heting, vice chairmen of the Autonomous Region People's Committee, have successively gone to the Hotan, Kashgar, and Aksu regions to lead the grain requisitioning and purchasing work and the large-scale debate centered on the grain issue. When they went to the countryside, they lived in the homes of Uygur farmers, sometimes working alongside the farmers, and when talking with the farmers, they discovered problems existing in agricultural cooperatives and production, and immediately worked with county and district cadres to solve them in a timely manner. Since May of this year, leading cadres of the Autonomous Region People's Bank have taken turns going to county branches and district business offices to inspect credit recall work and help grassroots banks do a good job in rural and urban savings, recovering agricultural loans, and recovering advance purchase deposits for cotton and grain. Tao Zhiyue, deputy commander of the Xinjiang Military Region, went to the Urumqi-Korla highway construction site in late September to inspect the work. He climbed the Tianshan peak at an altitude of three to four thousand meters and ate and lived with the soldiers building the road. Since Zhang Yuanlin, secretary of the Party Committee of the Karamay Mining Bureau, was transferred to the Transportation Department of the Mining Bureau as the Party Committee secretary in July of this year, he has worked with the leading comrades of the department to solve many problems existing in the work, bringing about a new atmosphere in production. From January to March of this year, the Transportation Department had 102 accidents, but in July and August, there were only 15 minor accidents, and the dispatch rate also increased significantly.

    新疆许多领导干部深入下层
    本报乌鲁木齐20日电  新疆维吾尔自治区领导干部深入下层工作，密切了和群众的联系。
    自整风运动开始以来，自治区党委书记武开章，自治区人民委员会副主席辛兰亭、杨和亭等，先后到和阗、喀什和阿克苏专区，领导征粮、购粮工作和以粮食问题为中心的大辩论。他们下乡时，住在维吾尔族农民家里，有时和农民在一起劳动，和农民谈心时，发现农业社和生产方面存在的问题，立即协同县区干部及时解决。自治区人民银行的领导干部自今年5月以来，轮流下到县支行和区营业所，检查信用回笼工作，帮助基层银行搞好农村和城市的储蓄、收回农贷、收回棉花和粮食的预购定金等项工作。新疆军区副司令员陶峙岳于9月下旬前往正在修筑的乌鲁木齐—库尔勒公路工地检查工作，他登上海拔三、四千公尺的天山高峰，和修路的战士同吃同住。克拉玛依矿务局党委书记张元林自今年7月下放到矿务局运输处任党委书记后，协同该处领导同志解决了许多工作中存在的问题，使生产出现了新气象。运输处从今年1月到3月，发生事故一百零二次，7、8月份仅发生轻微事故十五次，出车率也显著上升了。
