Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, October 10th: Residents of the Norwegian capital held two demonstrations on October 9th to protest the visit of former Nazi General Speidel, commander of the Central European ground forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to Norway. Factory workers went on strike for forty-five minutes, and transport and maritime workers also joined the strike to express their protest.

About five hundred people participated in the first demonstration, gathering at Fornebu Airport, waving signs with the slogan: "Speidel, go home!"

The demonstrators mistakenly took British General Sugden, commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Nordic forces, who landed at Fornebu Airport, for Speidel and threw stones at him. Sugden was injured. As a result, Speidel had to temporarily change his plans and land at a Norwegian air force base fifty miles from Oslo. Norwegian military authorities originally intended to house him in a large hotel in the capital, but later had to place him in a secret residence near the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Nordic Command headquarters, seven miles from Oslo.

That evening, another three thousand students and Nazi victims held a rally. The chairman of the Norwegian National Student Union read a letter from the union's secretariat, which stated, "Speidel's arrival in Norway is an insult to Nazi victims and the Norwegian people!"

Speidel was also met with demonstrations by Copenhagen residents when he arrived in the Danish capital on the 8th.

    不许纳粹将军沾污挪威土地
    奥斯陆人民驱逐斯派达尔
    据新华社10日讯　奥斯陆消息：挪威首都居民10月9日举行了两次示威，抗议北大西洋集团中欧地面部队司令、德国前纳粹将军斯派达尔访问挪威。工厂工人罢工四十五分钟，运输和海运工人也参加罢工表示抗议。
    参加第一次示威的有五百人，他们集合在弗内布机场，手中挥舞着标语牌，上面写着：“斯派达尔，回家去！”
    示威者误把在弗内布机场着陆的北大西洋集团北欧部队司令、英国萨格登将军当作是斯派达尔，向他投掷石子。萨格登被击伤。因此斯派达尔不得不临时改变计划，改在离奥斯陆五十哩的挪威空军基地着陆。挪威军事当局原来打算让他在首都一家大旅馆居住，后来不得不把他安置在离奥斯陆七哩的北大西洋集团北欧司令部附近的一座秘密住所里。
    当天晚上又有三千学生和纳粹受害者举行集会。挪威全国学生联合会主席在会上宣读了联合会书记处的一封信，信上说，“斯派达尔到挪威是对纳粹受害者和挪威人民的侮辱！”
    斯派达尔8日到达丹麦首都时也遭到哥本哈根居民示威反对。
