Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 15th: The newly built Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has been officially handed over for use. Approximately 50,000 people gathered jubilantly on both sides of the bridgehead on the 15th to solemnly hold the completion and opening ceremony of the bridge.

Today, the entire city of Wuhan was adorned in festive attire. The Yangtze River Bridge, decorated with countless red flags, appeared particularly beautiful and magnificent. The citizens of Wuhan celebrated the completion and opening of this bridge, which they had been anticipating for decades, with immense enthusiasm. Many people got up before dawn to prepare meals, and the whole family, young and old, helped each other to attend the ceremony. The high embankments along the Yangtze River in the areas of Hanyang’s Tortoise Mountain and Wuchang’s Snake Mountain, as well as the related railways, highways, and connecting lines, were all crowded with jubilant people.

The ceremony began at 10:00 AM on the Yangtze River Bridge, hosted by Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun. When the loudspeaker announced that the ceremony was about to begin, thunderous applause and cheers immediately erupted in the ceremony area, which stretched for about two kilometers.

Before the ceremony began, a bridgehead concert with more than a thousand participants performed programs praising the Yangtze River Bridge. At the same time, a silver-gray airplane flew over the bridge twice, scattering a large number of slogans celebrating the completion and opening of the Yangtze River Bridge.

The ceremony was declared open.

Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun delivered a speech first. He warmly congratulated the completion of the Yangtze River Bridge, saying that the completion of this bridge is a sign of the infinite power of the socialist political and economic system, and another great symbol of Sino-Soviet friendship. His speech was constantly interrupted by warm applause.

Following this, Wang Shitai, Chairman of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Acceptance Committee and Deputy Director of the State Construction Commission, spoke, reporting on the acceptance process and results of the Yangtze River Bridge, pointing out that this project demonstrated a high degree of creativity in both design and construction.

Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways of China, and Yevgeny Kozhevnikov, Minister of Transport Construction of the Soviet Union, also spoke at the ceremony.

Also speaking at the ceremony were Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, Wang Kewen, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan, as well as Soviet expert team leader Xilin, who helped build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and Peng Min, Director of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau.

After the speeches, Li Fuchun cut the ribbon to open the railway bridge. At this time, the direct express train from Beijing to Pingxiang passed over the Yangtze River amidst the cheers of the crowds. A quarter of an hour later, another train, specially prepared for the heads of various central departments and Chinese and foreign guests attending the ceremony, followed the previous express train across the surging "natural barrier." As the train passed over the bridge, the cheers and applause inside and outside the train merged into one, drowning out the roar of the locomotive and the roaring waves of the Yangtze River.

Next, the opening of the highway bridge began. A large motorcade composed of more than 340 vehicles, led by six domestically produced Jiefang brand cars, slowly passed side by side in three rows across the wide highway bridge surface. On the sidewalks on both sides of the highway bridge, crowds dressed in festive attire waved bouquets and scarves to greet the Chinese and foreign guests in the cars; on the highway bridge surface, people scattered a layer of colored confetti; various colored balloons rose into the sky above the Yangtze River Bridge. At this time, the entire bridge was declared open. The jubilant crowds immediately surged from Snake Mountain and the Wuchang bridgehead like a tide towards Hanyang.

The ceremony concluded at 1:00 PM.

Also attending the ceremony today were Lu Dingyi and Kang Sheng, alternate members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Liao Chengzhi, Deputy Director, Wang Guangwei and Chai Shufan, Deputy Directors of the State Planning Commission, Liu Xing, Deputy Director of the State Construction Commission, Liu Lanbo, Minister of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, Liu Xiufeng, Minister of the Ministry of Building Construction, Wan Li, Minister of the Ministry of Urban Construction, Li Zhuchen, Minister of the Ministry of Food Industry, Wu Jingtian, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, Pan Zhenya, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Supervision, Wang Zhijie, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, and guests from various places.

More than 100 foreign guests from more than a dozen countries, including the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, also attended the ceremony. (Attached Pictures)

　　火车飞驰过长江
    千年理想成现实  万众欢腾庆通车
    新华社武汉15日电　新建武汉长江大桥已宣告正式交付使用。约五万人15日欢聚两岸桥头隆重举行了大桥落成通车典礼。
    今天，整个武汉市披上了节日盛装。被数不清的红旗装饰起来的长江大桥，显得格外美丽壮观。武汉市民以极大的热情来庆祝这座他们期待了几十年的大桥的落成通车。许多人天不见亮就起来作饭，全家扶老携幼前往参加典礼。汉阳龟山和武昌蛇山一带的江岸高大堤防上，以及有关的铁路、公路、联络线路上，到处是欢腾的人群。
    典礼从上午十时起在长江大桥上举行，主持人是国务院副总理李富春。当扩音器里宣告典礼就要开始的时候，在长约两公里的典礼区内，立即响起春雷般的掌声和欢呼声。
    典礼开始前，一千多人参加的桥头音乐会上，演出了歌颂长江大桥的节目，同时有一架银灰色的飞机在桥的上空两次飞过，散发了大批庆祝长江大桥建成通车的标语。
    典礼宣告开始了。
    国务院副总理李富春首先致词。他热烈祝贺长江大桥的建成，说这座大桥的建成是社会主义的政治制度和经济制度具有无限威力的一个标志，是中苏友谊伟大的又一标志。他的讲话不断为热烈的掌声打断。
    接着，武汉长江大桥验收接交委员会主任委员、国家建设委员会副主任王世泰讲话，他报告了长江大桥的验收过程和结果，指出这一工程在设计和施工方面都表现了高度的创造性。
    我国铁道部部长滕代远、苏联运输建设部部长科热夫尼科夫也先后在典礼上讲话。
    在典礼上讲话的，还有湖北省省长张体学，武汉市副市长王克文，以及帮助建设武汉长江大桥的苏联专家组组长西林和武汉长江大桥工程局局长彭敏。
    讲话完毕，铁路桥开始由李富春剪彩通车。这时候，北京开往凭祥的直达快车在人们的夹道欢呼中驶过长江。一刻钟以后，专为参加典礼的中央各部门负责人和中外来宾准备的另一列车，在前一列快车过去以后跟着驶过江水汹涌的“天堑”。在列车通过大桥的时候，车内车外的欢呼声和鼓掌声响成一片，淹没了机车的轰鸣和长江洪涛的呼号。
    接着，公路桥通车开始了。一支由三百四十多辆汽车组成的庞大的汽车队伍，在六辆国产解放牌汽车的带领下，徐徐地分三行并排通过宽阔的公路桥面。在公路桥两侧的人行道上，穿着节日盛装的人群挥舞花束和头巾，向车上的中外来宾致意；在公路桥面上，人们撒上了一层彩色纸屑；在长江大桥的上空，升起了各色气球。这时，全桥宣布开放。欢腾的人群立即从蛇山上、从武昌桥头潮水般地涌上桥头，朝着汉阳流去。
    下午一时，典礼宣告结束。
    今天参加典礼的还有中共中央政治局候补委员陆定一、康生，华侨事务委员会主任何香凝、副主任廖承志，国家计划委员会副主任王光伟、柴树藩，国家建设委员会副主任刘星，电力工业部部长刘澜波，建筑工程部部长刘秀峰，城市建设部部长万里，食品工业部部长李烛尘，铁道部副部长武竞天，监察部副部长潘震亚，中国铁路工会全国委员会主席王志杰等，以及各地来宾。
    参加典礼的还有苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚等十多个国家的一百多位外宾。（附图片）
