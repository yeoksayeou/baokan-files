    More and More Drought-Resistant Water Sources Are Being Found
    Xinhua News Agency report: Farmers in Henan and Jiangsu are using interception of river water and self-flowing irrigation networks to combat drought.
    Farmers in the areas bordering rivers in Henan Province are building a large number of river dams, intercepting and using river water at every stage, which has played a huge role in combating drought and planting wheat. Just the water intercepted by more than 100 river dams in 12 counties including Runan, Huangchuan, Hua County, and Xiping has irrigated a large amount of cracked farmland. In order to help farmers effectively use the water sources of the major rivers and reservoirs, the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently instructed the management organizations of the Nanwan, Boshan, and Banqiao reservoirs to release 75 cubic meters of water per second for nearby farmers to use for drought relief and wheat planting.
    Farmers in the area along the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu Province are using the original flood discharge gates, culverts, and river channels under the Grand Canal embankment to add some small-scale canals, gates, and irrigation and flood discharge openings to divert water from the Grand Canal into the fields. Each small-scale self-flowing irrigation network composed under a Grand Canal flood discharge gate can irrigate 30,000 to 40,000 mu of land. Now the drought on the east bank of the canal in this province has been relieved, and autumn planting has basically ended.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 22nd: In Guanghua County, Hubei Province, all townships have widely adopted the method of visiting old farmers or holding symposiums with old farmers to find a large number of water sources during the drought-resistant winter planting. According to incomplete statistics, the county has found 752 springs and dredged 315 dry wells during this drought-resistant winter planting. In addition, 350 water diversion canals and river dams have been built. In addition to the current drought-resistant planting of 75,000 mu of land, the water from these springs and wells and the river water diverted by the canals can be used to convert 20,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields in the future by fixing the springs and dredged dry wells. The newly built water diversion canals will also play a huge role in drought resistance and flood control in the future.
    Most of the springs and long-unrepaired dry well remains found by the townships this time were discovered based on the experience of old farmers. Under the guidance of Cao Yongting, an 80-year-old farmer, the resident cadre of the Yuanguang Cooperative in Xionghe Township found the remains of a dry well that had been out of repair for more than 50 years and quickly dug out water. Now the water from this well has been used for drought-resistant winter planting of more than 400 mu. Recently, the Guanghua County Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all townships to require members and young people to earnestly and humbly learn from the experience of old farmers. At the same time, it is also planned to absorb and train more than 120 old farmers who have made the greatest contributions and have the richest experience as farmer water conservancy technicians.

    抗旱水源越找越多
    新华社讯　河南、江苏农民利用拦蓄河水、自流灌溉网进行抗旱。
    河南省临河地区农民，兴修大批拦河坝，节节拦用河水，对抗旱种麦起了巨大作用。仅就汝南、潢川、滑县、西平等十二个县利用一百多处拦河坝所阻拦的水源，灌溉了大量的干裂的农田。中共信阳地委为了帮助农民有效地使用各主要河流和水库的水源，最近指示南湾、薄山、板桥等三个水库的管理机构放水七十五秒公方，供临近农民抗旱种麦使用。
    江苏北部沿运河地区农民利用运河堤下原有的排洪闸、涵洞和河道，增修一些小型的渠道、闸门和灌溉、排洪洞口，引运河水入田。每一个运河排洪闸下所组成的小型自流灌溉网，即可灌溉三四万亩田。现在这个省沿运河东岸旱象已经解除，秋种已基本结束。
    据新华社武汉22日电　湖北省光化县各乡在抗旱冬播中，普遍采用拜访老农或召开老农座谈会的办法，寻找出了大量水源。据不完全统计，在这次抗旱冬播中，全县已找出泉眼七百五十二处，挖通枯井三百一十五口，此外还修筑引水渠和拦河坝三百五十处。这些泉眼和井里的水和渠道引进的河水，除目前抗旱播种七万五千亩地以外，把泉眼和挖通的枯井固定下来，今后还可把两万亩旱地改成水田。新修的引水渠对今后抗旱防涝也将发挥巨大作用。
    这次各乡寻找出的泉眼和多年失修的枯井遗迹，绝大多数是依靠老农的经验而发现的。熊河乡远光社驻社干部在八十多岁的老农曹永亭指点下，找到了一口已失修五十多年的枯井遗迹，很快挖出了水，现在用这个井里的水已抗旱冬播四百多亩。最近，中共光化县委会指示各乡，要求社员和青年们认真虚心学习老农的经验。同时，还计划把这次贡献最大、经验最丰富的一百二十多个老农吸收培养为农民水利技术员。
