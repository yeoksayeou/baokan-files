New Victory for International Solidarity of the Working Class

The Fourth World Trade Union Congress, which began in Leipzig on October 4th, successfully concluded on the 15th. This congress was an unprecedented gathering of solidarity for the international working class. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the congress on its brilliant achievements.

At the time of this congress, the world's working class was facing intensified, insatiable exploitation and a frenzied offensive by international monopoly capitalist groups against workers in the capitalist world, taking advantage of the divisions in the trade union movements of various countries. How to oppose the exploitation of monopoly capital and strive for improved living and working conditions was a serious task for the congress. The congress provided a clear answer to this issue of greatest concern to workers worldwide. The congress summarized the experiences of trade union organizations in capitalist countries in this struggle. In the general resolution and the declaration of the congress, it was pointed out that trade union organizations of all factions should unite in the struggle against the exploitation of monopoly capital and strive for improved living and working conditions. The congress believes that any differences in opinion should not prevent workers from uniting to achieve this common goal. To promote unity, the report on the first agenda item – the general report on the world trade union movement – adopted by the congress put forward some important principles for establishing and developing international trade union relations, namely: equality and voluntariness, mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and friendly consultation. This valuable suggestion of the congress powerfully demonstrates that the World Federation of Trade Unions actively supports the demands of the working classes of all countries, genuinely cares about their vital interests, and spares no effort to strengthen the international solidarity of the world's working class.

In order to further strengthen the international solidarity of trade union organizations of various countries, the congress revised the charter of the World Federation of Trade Unions, explicitly stipulating that the World Trade Union Congress opens its doors to all trade union organizations. Trade union organizations from various countries wishing to participate in the World Trade Union Congress are not obligated to join the World Federation of Trade Unions. The various Trade Union Internationals affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions should not only deal with issues related to their industries, but also promote international friendly cooperation and mutual assistance. The congress also passed resolutions on the International Workers' Solidarity Fund and the rules for using the fund. This series of concrete measures to strengthen the international solidarity of trade union organizations of various countries will greatly help the unity of the world's working class and greatly enhance the prestige of the World Federation of Trade Unions among the broad masses of workers in various countries. This is one of the most important achievements of this congress.

Another important achievement of this congress is the unanimous agreement that workers and trade union organizations worldwide must strengthen concerted action to safeguard world peace. This is a strong support for the movement to defend world peace. The current international situation is at an extremely important stage, and imperialists, ignoring and rejecting the demands of the working people of all countries, refuse to realize disarmament and reduce military spending. U.S. imperialism is vigorously promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East and is currently stepping up its criminal activities to instigate aggression against Syria. Faced with this situation, the congress called on trade union organizations of all countries to further support the anti-colonialist struggle and emphasized that colonialism is the root cause of the suffering of the working class and all the people of oppressed countries. The congress believes that anti-colonialism and the struggle for national independence will inevitably become the fundamental task of the working class and trade union movement in countries that have not yet achieved independence. For the working class and trade union movement in countries that have already achieved independence, it remains a long-term and arduous important task. The congress also called on workers around the world to launch a worldwide movement demanding disarmament in the declaration. We believe that the development of this mass movement is of great significance to the development of the movement to defend world peace.

This congress was the most widely attended gathering in the history of the international trade union movement. Representatives of trade union organizations with various tendencies freely expressed their opinions, wishes, and demands at the congress. The series of resolutions and declarations adopted by the congress fully expressed the firm will of the working class around the world to strengthen unity and international cooperation in order to improve living conditions, defend trade union rights, and safeguard world peace. The Chinese working class and trade union organizations, as well as the people of the whole country, firmly support and respond to the various proposals and calls of the congress, and will do everything possible to continuously consolidate and strengthen the cooperation of the world's working class, promote the unity and solidarity of the world trade union movement, and safeguard world peace.

### 工人阶级国际团结的新胜利

　　工人阶级国际团结的新胜利
    从10月4日开始在来比锡举行的世界工会第四次代表大会已经在15日胜利闭幕了。这次大会是国际工人阶级空前团结的大会。中国工人阶级和中国人民衷心地祝贺大会获得辉煌的成就。
    在这次大会的时候，世界工人阶级面临着国际垄断资本集团利用世界各国工会运动的分裂，对资本主义世界工人加紧贪得无厌的剥削和疯狂进攻。应当怎样来反对垄断资本的剥削，争取改善生活和劳动条件，是大会的严重的任务。大会对这个全世界工人所最关心的问题，给了明确的回答。大会总结了资本主义各国工会组织在这一方面的斗争经验。在大会的总决议和大会宣言中，指出了各派工会组织应当在反对垄断资本的剥削、争取改善生活和劳动条件的斗争中团结在一起。大会认为，任何见解的不同，都不能够妨碍工人们团结起来争取达到这个共同目的。为了促进团结，大会通过的关于第一项议程的报告——世界工会运动的总报告，提出了建立和发展国际工会关系的一些重要原则，这就是：平等自愿、相互尊重、求同存异、友好协商。大会的这个宝贵的建议有力地证明了：世界工联是积极支持各国工人阶级的要求，真诚地关怀他们的切身利益，不遗余力地为加强世界工人阶级的国际团结而努力的。
    为了进一步加强各国工会组织的国际团结，大会修改了世界工联的章程，明确地规定世界工会代表大会向所有的工会组织敞开大门，凡愿参加世界工会代表大会的各国工会组织，并不承担加入世界工联的义务。世界工联所属的各个工会国际，不但应当处理同他们的产业有关的问题，还应当推动国际间的友好合作和团结互助。大会还通过了关于国际工人团结基金的决议和使用基金的规则。这一系列加强各国工会组织国际团结的具体措施，将大大有助于世界工人阶级的团结，并且大大增强世界工联在各国广大职工群众中的威望。这是这次大会的最重要的成就之一。
    这次大会的另一重要成就，就是大会一致认为全世界工人和工会组织必须加强一致行动来维护世界和平。这是对保卫世界和平运动的一个有力的支持。目前国际局势正处在一个极端重要阶段，帝国主义者无视并拒绝各国劳动人民的要求，不肯实现裁军和削减军备预算。美帝国主义在中近东地区竭力推行“艾森豪威尔主义”，目前正在加紧策动侵略叙利亚的罪恶活动。面临这种局势，大会号召一切国家的工会组织进一步支援反殖民主义的斗争，并强调指出殖民主义是被压迫国家的工人阶级和全体人民的痛苦的根源。大会认为，反殖民主义、争取民族独立就势必成为未独立国家的工人阶级和工会运动的根本任务。对于已经独立的国家的工人阶级和工会运动来说，也仍然是一项长期而艰巨的重要任务。大会在宣言中还号召全世界工人开展一个要求实现裁军的世界性的运动。我们相信，这一群众运动的开展，对于保卫世界和平运动的发展有着重大的意义。
    这次大会是国际工会运动史上最具有广泛群众性的一次集会。各种不同倾向的工会组织的代表在大会上自由地表达了他们的意见、愿望和要求。大会通过的一系列决议和宣言，充分表达了全世界工人阶级争取加强团结和加强国际合作，以便改善生活条件、保卫工会权利和保卫世界和平的坚决意志。中国工人阶级和工会组织以及全国人民坚决支持和响应大会的各项主张和号召，并且将尽一切力量来为不断地巩固和加强世界工人阶级的合作、促进世界工会运动的统一团结、保卫世界和平而努力。
