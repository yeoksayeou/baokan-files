Commemorating the Fortieth Anniversary of the October Revolution
Compilation and Publication of Play Collections by Soviet Writers

The China Theatre Publishing House has decided to systematically compile and publish a series of play collections by famous Soviet writers, as a gift for the October Revolution anniversary.

The play collections include representative works by twenty famous modern Soviet playwrights, essentially encompassing many excellent plays from the Soviet Union over the past forty years.

Among them, the complete works of Maxim Gorky, the founder of socialist realism, will be published. The translation of Gorky's plays and the revision of older translations are being carried out by comrades Lin Ling, Chen Bingyi, Fang Xin, and others. This complete collection will be published in four volumes in the first half of next year.

Other writers will have collections of their important plays compiled, such as the Vsevolod Vishnevsky play collection, including "The First Cavalry Army" and "An Optimistic Tragedy"; the Lavrenyov play collection, including "The Breakup," "Those Who Live by the Sea," and "The Voice of America"; the Afinogenov play collection, including "The Eccentric," "Fear," "My Family," and "Mashenka"; the Trenyov play collection, including "Lyubov Yarovaya" and "The Great Commander"; the Leonov play collection, including "Ordinary People" and "Invasion"; and the Romashov play collection, including "The Great Power" and "The Burning Bridge." These special collections will begin publication this year and be completed by 1959.

Play collections by Pogodin and Sofronov will be published before the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution.

Each collection will be accompanied by relevant materials, such as author biographies, play reviews, and production photos, for reference in reading and performance.

In addition, the China Theatre Publishing House will also publish several plays about the October Revolution in single-volume form this year, such as "On the Banks of the Neva" (already published), "The First Cavalry Army" (already published), "My Friend," "The Man with the Gun," and "The Kremlin Chimes"; and plays about Soviet socialist construction, such as "Song of the Axe," "Time, Forward!" and "Moscow Character."
