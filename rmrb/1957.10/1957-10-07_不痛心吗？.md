Doesn't it hurt?

The raw materials for the spring steel strips we are currently processing are not available in Shenyang City, so the materials department goes to other places to buy them and airfreights them back. In order to complete the plan, the materials department overcomes difficulties to buy the raw materials, and we should make good use of them. But the blanking section is not doing that. The parts we process are 72 mm long, but they cut the strips to 500 mm long, each of which can only process six rows, three in each row, leaving 65 mm wasted. Sixty-five mm are wasted for each strip. If we calculate all the waste material, it would be difficult to calculate its value. Isn't this heartbreaking?

    不痛心吗？
    我们现在正在加工的弹簧片的原料，在沈阳市买不到，材料科就到外地去买，用飞机运回来。为了完成计划，材料科不怕困难把原料买来，我们就应该很好利用。但是下料工段却不是这样。我们加工出来的部件长七十二m／m，但他们剪成的板条长五百m／m，每条只能加工六排，每排三个，剩余的六十五m／m，就浪费掉了。一条浪费六十五m／m，把所有料头计算起来怕就难以计算它的价值了。这不令人痛心吗？
