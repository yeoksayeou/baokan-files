Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: Soviet experts who are assisting our country's industrial and transportation departments in production and construction have fully implemented the spirit of diligence and thrift.

Soviet experts highly value our country's material resources and help us to avoid waste as much as possible. In 1951, the Huadong Fangzi Coal Mine under the Ministry of Coal Industry believed that the coal had been exhausted and proposed to scrap the mine. After a detailed investigation based on the suggestion of Soviet experts, it was discovered that there was still coal, and as a result, this coal mine is still in production today. The Lifeng and Wangfeng Coal Mines in Jiaozuo, and the Fengfeng, Mentougou, and Jingxing Fengshan Coal Mines have all actively adopted measures to restore and rebuild their mines, extending the life of the mines, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts.

The Shuikoushan Lead-Zinc Mine in Hunan under the Ministry of Metallurgy had not discovered any new ore veins after several years of exploration and was about to cease mining. After Soviet experts studied the situation and guided our exploration efforts, new mineral reserves were finally discovered. Now, this mine can not only continue to be mined, but also has the potential for expansion. When the Fushun Oil Refinery under the Ministry of Petroleum Industry was refining artificial petroleum, 40% of the small shale pieces were discarded in the past; Soviet experts proposed conducting small-scale retorting furnace oil refining experiments, and as a result, the shale utilization rate reached 80% this year. In the past, during ore dressing at the Pinggui Tin Mine, small particles could not be separated and were wasted. Soviet experts helped us use spiral separators for selection, and now more than 70% of the ore can be selected, which is more than twice as high as in the past. Soviet experts at the Shenyang Smelter felt it was a great pity that many rare metals were escaping from the chimneys, so they suggested and specifically helped us to recover them.

Our country's old iron and steel enterprises were all small in scale and had outdated equipment, but Soviet experts attached great importance to these factories and actively helped us complete reconstruction and expansion work, greatly increasing production capacity. The Fengtai, Shanhaiguan, and Shenyang Railway Bridge Factories used to have an annual output of only 300 to 500 tons. Soviet experts helped us carry out technical renovations by making the most of existing equipment and adding only a few new pieces, increasing the annual output of these three factories to 12,000 to 20,000 tons. In the early days of Liberation, the machines in many power plants in our country were old and worn out, and their output was very low. However, Soviet experts valued them very much and taught us how to carry out repairs, maintenance, and upkeep. As a result, many generators achieved their nameplate output and ran almost as well as new ones.

Soviet experts attach great importance to the principle of reducing project investment and costs put forward by our government. For example, the design for the Guangdong Smelter prepared by the Nonferrous Metallurgical Design Institute had already been completed, but after the central government clearly put forward the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift last year, Soviet experts went deep into the site to conduct research and proposed a new design plan, which appropriately reduced the scale of the plant and adopted a medium level of technology, reducing investment from 17 million yuan to only 2.2 million yuan. In the work of revising the design to reduce investment at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company this year, just one Soviet expert reviewed and suggested revisions to design projects totaling more than 3 million yuan. In 1955, Soviet experts working in the Ministry of Railways organized an expert group to inspect newly built railway lines and put forward 52 suggestions for saving investment and reducing costs, providing the railway department with a direction to reduce costs. In that year alone, the cost reduction amounted to more than 15% of the investment.

Soviet experts are very good at careful calculation and saving raw materials. For example, they suggest building more stone arch bridges on railway lines to save steel and cement, using lump coal on trains to save coal, and suggesting that power systems and electricity-using enterprises adjust their loads and save electricity. They personally help us manufacture tools to save foreign exchange.

### 在工业建设上贯彻勤俭节约精神  苏联专家处处帮我们节约资源

    在工业建设上贯彻勤俭节约精神
    苏联专家处处帮我们节约资源
    据新华社27日讯　帮助我国各工业、交通部门进行生产和建设的苏联专家，充分贯彻了勤俭节约的精神。
    苏联专家非常珍惜我国的物质资源，帮助我们尽量避免浪费。煤炭工业部的华东坊子煤矿，1951年时认为煤已经采完提出要报废。经苏联专家建议进行详细调查以后发现还有煤，结果，这个煤矿到现在还在继续生产。焦作的李封煤矿、王封煤矿，峰峰、门头沟、井陉凤山等煤矿都因苏联专家的建议，积极采取了恢复改建的措施，延长了矿井的寿命。
    冶金部的湖南水口山铅锌矿，过去勘探了几年没有发现新矿苗，将要停止开采。经苏联专家研究并指导我们进行勘探后，新的矿量终于被发现。现在，这个矿不仅能继续开采，还有条件扩建。石油工业部抚顺炼油厂炼制人造石油时，过去有占全部页岩40％的小块油母页岩被抛弃；苏联专家提出进行小块干馏炉试验炼油，结果，今年页岩利用率达到了80％。过去平桂锡矿选矿时小颗粒选不出来都浪费了。苏联专家帮助我们用螺旋分离器选，现在有百分之七十几的矿能选出来，比过去高一倍多。苏联专家在沈阳冶炼厂看到从烟囱里面跑掉了许多稀有金属，感到十分可惜，就建议并具体帮助我们来进行回收。
    我国旧有的钢铁企业规模都很小，设备也很陈旧，但是苏联专家很重视这些厂子，积极地帮助我们完成了改建和扩建工作，使生产能力大为提高。丰台、山海关和沈阳的铁路桥梁厂过去年产量只有三百到五百吨，苏联专家帮助我们在尽量利用原有设备，只增添部分新设备的情况下而进行技术改造，把这三个厂的年产量提高到了一万二到二万吨。解放初期，我国许多发电厂的机器都老掉了“牙齿”，出力很低。苏联专家却很珍贵它们，教我们进行检修和保养维护，结果许多发电机都达到了铭牌出力，运行起来和新的差不多。
    苏联专家很重视我国政府提出的降低工程投资和造价的方针。如有色冶金设计院为广东冶炼厂作的设计已经作好了，但是在去年中央明确提出勤俭建国的方针以后，苏联专家又深入现场进行研究，提出一个新的设计方案，即适当缩小建厂规模，采用中等的技术水平，使投资从一千七百万元，减少到只要二百二十万元。在今年武汉钢铁公司修改设计削减投资的工作中，只一位苏联专家就审核和建议修改了合三百多万元的设计项目。1955年，在铁道部工作的苏联专家曾组织过一个专家组去新建铁路线核查，提出了节省投资降低造价的五十二条建议，为铁道部门降低造价找到了方向。只在当年，降低造价就达投资的15％还多。
    苏联专家很会精打细算，节约原材料。例如建议在铁路线上多修石拱桥。节约钢材水泥，建议火车上采用块煤节约煤炭。建议电力系统和用电企业进行调整负荷、节约用电。亲自动手帮助我们来制造工具，节约外汇。
