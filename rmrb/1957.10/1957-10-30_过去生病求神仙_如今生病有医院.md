    In the past, when the people of the Yimeng Mountain area got sick, they had no choice but to pray to gods and worship Buddha, or endure the suffering. Now, clinics and hospitals are everywhere in the Yimeng Mountain area, and people can go to doctors when they get sick. Currently, in the six counties of Yishui, Yiyuan, Yinan, Fei, Pingyi, and Mengyin in this mountain area, each county has a well-equipped county-level health院(yuan, hospital or institute), and various health and medical organizations have also been established in districts, townships, and towns of each county. At present, there are 313 joint clinics, 898 new-style midwifery stations, and 5 leprosariums. These health and medical institutions have conducted widespread investigations and free mobile treatment for various endemic diseases such as kala-azar, leprosy, hookworm disease, and smallpox. In the Yimeng Mountain area, smallpox, which had long harmed the health of the masses, has now been eradicated, kala-azar has been basically eliminated, and hookworm disease has also been greatly reduced.

    在旧社会，沂蒙山区的人民生了病，就只好求神仙拜菩萨，再不然就苦熬着，现在，沂蒙山区处处有诊所医院，人们生病可以去找医生了。现在这个山区的沂水、沂源、沂南、费县、平邑、蒙阴六县，每县都有一处设备较完善的县立卫生院，各县的区、乡、镇也建立了各种卫生医疗组织。目前，共有联合诊所三百一十三处，新法接生站八百九十八处，麻疯防治站五处；这些卫生医疗机构，对黑热病，麻疯病、钩虫病、天花等各种地方病，普遍进行了调查和免费巡回治疗。在沂蒙山区，长期危害群众身体健康的天花现已根绝，黑热病基本扑灭，钩虫病也大大减少。
