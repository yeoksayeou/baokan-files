　　Glimpses on the Eve of the Soviet Festival

　　A New Book

　　To commemorate Lenin, the leader of the great October Revolution, the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will compile an interesting book, which will record what Lenin did every day in 1917. Readers can see from this book how much arduous work the great revolutionary and theorist Lenin carried out in the year he led the October Revolution, and how many immortal works he wrote.

　　As early as 1934, Lenin’s secretary, Golyasher, wrote a pamphlet in this way, recording Lenin’s activities every day from January to February 1921, which aroused widespread interest among readers.

　　Several Films

　　Several newly made films depicting the immortal image of Lenin will meet the audience during the October Revolution Festival.

　　In the film "The Ulyanov Family," the audience can see the life of a loving family. The film shows the formation of Lenin's character in his childhood and the grief of the whole family caused by the execution of Lenin's brother Alexander for assassinating the Tsar. The documentary film "Lenin Lived Here" was shot in many places in the Soviet Union and abroad. It shows Lenin's revolutionary work over the years and introduces the places related to Lenin's life and work.

　　Four Hundred Plays

　　To welcome the October Revolution Festival, theaters across the Soviet Union will stage four hundred new plays, some of which reflect the heroic struggles of the Soviet people, and some of which are themed on the lives of modern Soviet people. There are now three hundred drama theaters and one hundred opera houses across the country that are stepping up rehearsals.

　　苏联节日前夕点滴
    一本新书
    为纪念伟大的十月革命的领导者列宁，苏共中央马克思—列宁主义研究院将编写一本饶有兴趣的书，这本书将记载列宁在1917年每一天做了些什么事。读者从这本书中可以看到伟大的革命家和理论家列宁，在领导十月革命起义的那一年进行了多么浩繁艰巨的工作，写出了多少不朽的著作。
    早在1934年，列宁的秘书格利亚谢尔就曾经用这种方法写过一本小册子，记录了列宁在1921年1月到2月每一天的活动，引起了读者的广泛兴趣。
    几部影片
    在十月革命节时，将有好几部新制的刻划列宁不朽形象的影片和观众见面。
    观众在影片“乌里扬诺夫一家”中可以看到一个友爱家庭的生活。影片表现了幼年时代列宁性格的形成和由于列宁的哥哥亚历山大行刺沙皇被处死所引起的全家的悲痛。纪录影片“列宁在这里住过”是在苏联国内外许多地方拍摄成的。它表现了列宁多年的革命工作，也介绍了同列宁的生活和工作有关的地方。
    四百出戏
    为迎接十月革命节，苏联各地剧院将上演四百个新剧目，其中有的是反映苏联人民英勇斗争的历史，有的以现代苏联人的生活为主题。现在全国有三百个话剧院和一百个歌剧院正在加紧排练。
