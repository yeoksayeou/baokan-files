More Cotton Sold, More Cloth Can Be Bought
Ministry of Commerce and All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Stipulate Specific Measures

(This newspaper report) According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council regarding this year's cotton unified purchase work: in order to encourage cotton farmers to sell more and retain less, and stabilize the cotton planting area, cotton farmers can be given preferential supply of five "shi chi" (Chinese feet) of cotton cloth outside the planned supply quota for every 100 "jin" (50kg) of ginned cotton sold. The Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives have made specific regulations based on this instruction and issued a joint notice to cotton-producing provinces.

The notice said: Agricultural production cooperatives or individual households selling cotton should be given preferential treatment according to regulations. If the remainder of cotton sold is more than five "jin" but less than ten "jin", it can be calculated as ten "jin", and five "cun" (Chinese inches) of cotton cloth will be supplied; however, no preferential cotton cloth will be given if the total amount sold is less than ten "jin". State-owned farms, military region production units, and labor reform farms selling cotton, as well as cotton farmers paying cotton as tax to the state, will not be given preferential cotton cloth. Preferential cotton cloth coupons can be issued upon presentation of the cotton sales certificate. After issuance, a stamp of "Preferential Cloth Coupon Issued" must be affixed to the cotton sales certificate to prevent reissuance. The cloth coupons issued to agricultural cooperatives can be handled by the agricultural cooperatives themselves. These preferential cloth coupons should be uniformly printed and issued by the province (or city) (using the surplus cloth coupons from the fourth year with a stamp or printing special cloth coupons) to prevent abuses. The period of use shall expire at the end of August 1958. (Wang Jiayou)

    多卖棉花可以多买布
    商业部和供销合作总社规定了具体办法
    本报讯　中共中央、国务院关于本年度棉花统购工作的指示中规定：为了鼓励棉农少留多卖，稳定棉花的播种面积、棉农每出售一百市斤皮棉，可以在棉布计划供应指标以外，优待供应棉布五市尺。商业部、供销合作总社已根据这个指示作出具体规定，并对产棉省份发出联合通知。
    通知说：农业生产合作社或个体户出售棉花都应按规定给予优待。如售棉尾数在五市斤以上不足十市斤的，可以按十市斤计算，供应棉布五市寸；但出售总数不满十斤的，不予棉布优待。对国营农场、军区生产部队、劳改农场出售的棉花以及棉农向国家缴纳的赋棉，一律不给优待棉布。优待供应的棉布布票，可凭售棉证发给。发后须在售棉证上加盖“优待布票已发”戳记，以防重发。发给农业社的布票可由农业社自行处理。这种优待布票应由省（市）统一制发（利用第四年度多余布票加盖印章或印制专用布票），防止流弊。使用期限一律到1958年8月底截止。　　（王家佑）
