Promoting the Righteous Spirit of Cooperativization and Curbing the Evil Trend of Withdrawing from the Cooperative
Advanced Third Cooperative of Tongliao Takes on a New Look After Debate

(Reported by our newspaper) The Advanced Third Agricultural Cooperative in Qianjiadian Town, Tongliao County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, launched a socialist debate, quelled an evil wind of withdrawing from the cooperative, and the cooperative members further recognized the socialist future, greatly improved their ideological awareness, and set off an unprecedented upsurge of autumn harvest increase and production self-salvation. Individual farmers also became convinced of the superiority of cooperativization and actively applied to join the cooperative.

Rich Middle Peasants Stir Up Trouble, Causing Panic Among Cooperative Members

In early September, the Advanced Third Agricultural Cooperative faced the most severe test in the three years since its establishment. The breach of the West Liao River washed away more than half of the crops, and the mood of the cooperative members was generally low. The labor attendance rate was less than one-third each day. Out of 132 households in the cooperative, 16 had already applied to withdraw, 14 were listless and prepared to withdraw, and more than 40 were panicked by the evil atmosphere, worrying about the fate of the cooperative and having no heart to work.

Those who actively took the lead in withdrawing from the cooperative, in addition to a few bad elements who had long been plotting to dismantle the cooperative, such as Zheng Yongwen, who had been a puppet police officer and a hooligan, and who had always violated labor discipline, beat and scolded cooperative cadres, and falsely accused the cooperative of being a labor camp, clamoring that there was no freedom in the cooperative, and declaring that he would set an example for withdrawing from the cooperative, most of them were rich middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas and activities. They were swept into the cooperative at the time of the cooperativization wave and had been physically in the cooperative but mentally outside for a year. For example, Kong Xianwen often flaunted his "superiority" when he worked individually after joining the cooperative, and did not settle down to participate in labor within the cooperative. In the spring, he saw that the price of pigs was high in the market, so he asked for leave to transport piglets. In the summer, he opened a "small processing factory" to engage in grain speculation and sales. In the autumn, he hired outside disaster victims to collect firewood for sale, engaging in harsh exploitation. In the cooperative, he only worked 32 labor days. After the cooperative suffered a disaster, people like Kong Xianwen became active. On the one hand, they bought carts and harnesses to prepare for individual farming. On the other hand, they encouraged cooperative members who were wavering in their thinking or had some opinions about the cooperative to withdraw from the cooperative so that they could have cheaper labor for exploitation. Under their temptation and instigation, the evil atmosphere of withdrawing from the cooperative filled the sky. Poor peasant Lan Qingshan also shouted that he wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. Although he had no capital to engage in speculation and sales, he spent a few cents to buy a string of fishing hooks and went to the South River bank to fish. He would not listen to the cooperative cadres' persuasion to return to the cooperative to work. He could not catch more than two pounds of fish every day, and then he picked up two broken baskets and started a business of selling small fish and tomatoes.

After Debate, Right and Wrong Are Clear, and Confidence in Running the Cooperative Is More Firmly Established

The Qianjiadian Town General Branch of the Communist Party of China assisted the Party branch of the cooperative in analyzing the thoughts of the cooperative members. Starting from September 10, it led the cooperative to conduct a great debate on two roads. Did cooperativization have superiority? Which road should be taken?

The debate was very intense, with the number of people increasing each time. By the fifth time, almost all of the cooperative members were present, and several individual farmers outside the cooperative also came to participate in the debate voluntarily. Everyone used the method of recalling comparison and calculating details to abandon the old capitalist road, criticize capitalist ideas, and, more importantly, use facts to illustrate the bright future of the socialist road and the unparalleled superiority of cooperativization. The cooperative achieved a bumper harvest in the first year of its establishment, with a 47% increase in production compared to individual farming. The income of general laborers reached more than 400 yuan. The second year was another bumper harvest, with a 61% increase in production. The income of general laborers was 600 to 700 yuan. Except for one rich middle peasant whose income did not increase or decrease, the income of every household in the cooperative increased, and their lives completely changed. Deputy Director Lin Xiu used statistical materials to point out that in the autumn of last year alone, all male and female cooperative members wore three new layers of cotton clothes, bought more than 50 cotton overcoats, more than 30 pairs of leather shoes, and made 398 new cotton quilts, an average of three quilts per household. Cooperative member Wang Tingzhen described his life changes in the past three years in detail, which was the most touching. Because before joining the cooperative, his family of five lacked food and clothing and lived in a half-room dilapidated house, but now they live in a three-room tall house with glass windows, everyone has new clothes, and there is surplus grain in the home. This year, although the cooperative suffered a serious disaster, it is estimated that it can still harvest more than 1,000 dan of grain, an average of 7.6 dan per household, which is 20% more than the harvest of individual households. According to the plan to develop sideline production, each labor day can still be divided into 1.5 yuan, which is more than the income of the year before the establishment of the cooperative. These facts effectively encouraged the cooperative members' confidence in continuing to run the cooperative well, and their determination to take the road of cooperativization became more firm.

On the basis of raising awareness, the cooperative members exposed and criticized the conspiracies of bad elements and certain rich middle peasants to undermine the cooperative, as well as the individual serious violations of law and discipline and taking the opportunity to steal state grain. Cooperative member Qi Guozhen said angrily to Kong Xianwen: "Your heart is too bad. My wife and I are both in our sixties, and you still come to instigate withdrawal from the cooperative. Isn't this clearly pushing me into the fire pit? I almost fell for your trick and took the wrong path." Those who had already applied to withdraw from the cooperative declared that they would never withdraw. Zheng Yongwen made a self-criticism to all the cooperative members, saying: "I didn't work well in the cooperative before. I thought, can't ten monks survive a bald one? If I couldn't find loopholes, I would beat and scold cadres, which played a role in destroying the cooperative." He apologized to everyone and said that he would truly be a good cooperative member.

Production Enthusiasm Is Unprecedentedly High, and the Entire Cooperative Shows a Prosperous Atmosphere

The socialist debate has not yet ended and will continue after the autumn harvest. But now it has received significant results, and production enthusiasm has generally risen. Kong Xianwen, who had previously made the most trouble about withdrawing from the cooperative, asked for tools to go to grass-cutting after making a preliminary self-criticism, and said that he would overcome capitalist ideas and actively work hard in the cooperative to atone for his sins. Poor peasant cooperative member Lan Qingshan, although everyone did not ask him to make a self-criticism, has realized that withdrawing from the cooperative has no future, threw away the broken baskets for doing business, and voluntarily participated in labor. According to the inspection by the Party branch on September 27, all laborers in the cooperative except for two who were ill participated in the labor, and launched a labor competition for production self-salvation and autumn harvest increase. Comrade Zhang Cai, the director of the cooperative, said happily: "This is the highest record of labor attendance rate in the three years since the establishment of the cooperative. In the past, even during the most tense season of summer hoeing, there were always ten or eight people asking for leave."

After participating in the debate, individual farmer Luo Chunrong went to find Party member Qiao Guizhen and immediately made a self-criticism, saying: "I am so sorry for you! You mobilized me to join the cooperative in the spring, but at that time I really didn't understand the situation. I always felt that individual farming was more efficient than a large group of people working together, but now I understand. I can only harvest two dan of grain this year at most. What do you think I can do! We suffered the same disaster, but the cooperative can still distribute 1.5 to 1.6 yuan per labor day. I really regret it!" Now five individual farmers have firmly expressed their desire to apply to join the cooperative.

    发扬合作化正气　制止闹退社歪风
    通辽先进第三社经过辩论气象崭新
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区通辽县钱家店镇先进第三农业社开展社会主义大辩论，平息了一场闹退社的妖风邪气，社员们更加认清了社会主义前途，思想觉悟大大提高，掀起空前未有的秋收增产和生产自救的热潮。单干农民也信服了合作化的优越性，积极申请入社。
    富裕中农兴风作浪　搅得社员人心惶惶
    9月初，先进第三农业社面临着建社三年来最严重的考验。西辽河决口冲毁过半数的庄稼，社员的情绪普遍低落。劳动出勤率每天还不及三分之一。全社一百三十二户中已有十六户提出退社，还有十四户无精打采，准备退社，有四十多户被邪气搅扰的人心惶惶，耽心着社的命运，没心思干活。
    积极带头闹退社的，除个别蓄谋已久企图拆散社的坏分子，如曾当过伪警察、流氓出身的郑永文，一贯不遵守劳动纪律，打骂社干部并诬蔑说社是劳改队，大肆叫嚷社里没自由，声言要给退社作榜样，大多数是有严重资本主义思想和活动的富裕中农。他们入社当时是被合作化的浪潮卷入的，一年来身在社心在外。比如孔宪文，入社后还经常炫耀他单干时的“优越”，不安心参加社内劳动，春天看到市上猪价高，借故请假贩运小猪，夏天开起“小加工厂”作粮食投机买卖，秋天雇外来灾民打柴卖，进行苛刻剥削。在社里他仅仅做了三十二个劳动日。社受灾后，像孔宪文这些富裕中农活跃起来了，他们一面买车做套，做单干的准备，一面鼓动思想动摇或对社有些意见的社员退社，以便使他们有更廉价的劳动力进行剥削。而就在他们的诱惑和煽动下，闹退社的邪气弥漫了天空。贫农蓝青山也叫喊要退社，虽然他没有什么去做投机买卖的资本，可是他却花几角钱买了串钓鱼钩，到南河沿钓鱼去了。社干部劝他回社劳动也不听。每天钓不了二斤鱼，转念又拾掇起两个破筐，做起贩卖小鱼和西红柿的买卖。
    经过辩论是非分明　办社信心更加坚定
    中共钱家店镇总支委员会协助该社党支部，分析了社员们的思想以后，从9月10日开始，领导该社进行了一场两条道路的大辩论。合作化是否有优越性？应该走哪条路？
    辩论会进行的很激烈，人数一次比一次增多，到第五次时，社员们几乎都统统到场了，社外的几户单干农民也都自动来参加了辩论。大家以回忆对比算细账的办法，唾弃了资本主义老路，批评了资本主义思想，而更重要的是用事实说明了社会主义道路的美好前途，合作化的无比优越。该社建社头一年即获得丰收，比单干时增产47％，一般劳动力收入达四百多元；第二年又是特大丰收，增产61％，一般劳动力收入六百到七百元，全社除一户富裕中农收入不增不减外，家家收入增加，生活彻底变了样。副主任蔺秀根据统计材料，举出仅去年秋后，全社男女社员就都穿上里外三新的棉衣服，买了五十多件棉大衣，三十多双皮鞋，做新棉被三百九十八床，平均每户就做了三床。社员王廷珍详细地述说了他三年来的生活变化，最使人感动。因为他在入社前全家五口人缺吃少穿，住着半间大的破房，而现在却住着三间大高房，镶着玻璃窗，人人新衣服，家中存余粮。今年，社里虽然受灾严重，但是估算依旧能打一千多石粮食，每户平均七石六斗，收成比单干户要多二成，按照开展副业生产的计划，每个劳动日仍然能分一元五角，比建社前一年的收入还多。这些事实，有效地鼓舞了社员们把社继续搞好的信心，走合作化道路的决心更坚定了。
    社员们在提高认识的基础上，揭发与批判了坏分子和某些富裕中农企图搞垮社的阴谋，及个别严重违法乱纪、乘机偷窃国家粮食等行为。社员齐国珍气愤地对着孔宪文说：“你的心太不好啦，我老俩口都六十来岁了，你还来挑拨退社，这不明明推我下火坑吗？差点上了你的当，走错路。”已经提出退社的都声明永不退社了。郑永文向全体社员作检讨说：“原先在社里就没好好的劳动，心里想十个和尚还混不住个秃子？钻空子不成就打骂干部，起了破坏社的作用。”他向大家请罪，表示要真正当个好社员。
    生产热情空前高涨　全社出现兴旺气象
    社会主义大辩论还没结束，还将继续在秋后辩论下去。但是现在已经收到显著的效果，生产积极性普遍高涨起来了。原先闹退社最凶的孔宪文，初步检讨之后就提了工具要求去打草，并表示要克服资本主义思想，在社积极劳动立功赎罪。贫农社员蓝青山，虽然大家没让他检讨，但已觉悟到退社是没前途，扔掉了做买卖的破筐，自动参加了劳动。据9月27日党支部检查，全社除二名因病外所有劳动力都参加了劳动，开展了生产自救和秋收增产的劳动竞赛。该社主任张才同志高兴的说：“建社三年来这次是创造了劳动出勤率最高的纪录，过去即便是夏锄最紧张的季节，也总有十个八个请假呢。”
    社外单干农民罗春荣在参加完辩论会后就去找党员乔桂珍，见面就检讨说：“我太对不起你了！春天你动员我入社，那时实在还不摸底，总觉得单干比大帮人去干活利落，这会可托底了。我今年最多打两石粮，你说我够啥！同样是受了灾，社里还能一个劳动日分一元五六，我真后悔啊！”现在已经有五户单干农民坚决表示申请入社。
