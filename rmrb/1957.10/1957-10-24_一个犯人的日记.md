Title: A Prisoner's Diary

Editor's Note: This "diary" was written by Liu Bingkun, a former criminal who was released from prison and employed at the Xinsheng Brick and Tile Factory of the Hubei Provincial Public Security Bureau. This "diary" fully exposes the deep class hatred that some counter-revolutionaries harbor towards the Communist Party and the People's Government. In the face of our powerful dictatorship, they appear to have bowed their heads and confessed their guilt on the surface, but in their hearts, it is a completely different story. Therefore, when the bourgeois rightists launched a wild attack on the Party, they eagerly tried to coordinate from within and without to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration activities.

Counter-revolutionary elements can educate us from the negative side. Now we are publishing this "diary" for some comrades who think that the world is at peace and they can rest easy to see how we should raise our vigilance to deal with these unrepentant counter-revolutionary elements.

May 10

After reading today's newspaper, I suddenly understood. It turns out that the Communist Party announced the rectification campaign because it had disagreements and friction with the democratic figures, and wanted to improve relations. The speeches of Cheng Qianfan and others were full of grievances and endless complaints. This is truly deserved! Back then, they were dissatisfied with this and that, only wishing for our downfall. Now that the Americans are gone, we have collapsed, and these people have not been able to rise to the top in one step. Now they should understand!

"Scholars have no morals" has always been the case and will not be liked by anyone.

May 15

The People's Daily editorial on the 13th, "Talking about Workers' Troubles," admits that the Communist Party has had strikes, parades, and petitions. This is truly great news! Good! Hurray, hurray! The Communist Party is about to collapse!

No wonder the People's Daily has recently published a series of editorials calling for the correct handling of internal contradictions among the people. It is because the people no longer trust them. Where there are contradictions, there will naturally be conflicts; where there are conflicts, there will naturally be wars. God, may the Hungarian event come to China soon, let the flames burn all over the world, let the blood flood the globe!

We have really suffered enough in the past few years. The prisoners of the past six years are all the honored guests of eight years ago. There are many people in the labor camp who hate the Communist Party. We must start organizing, and sometimes we can have a career to do.

May 16

Chen Mingshu's demand that the Communist Party abolish the Party committee system is indeed a bold opinion, worthy of the spirit of a great general. Good! Another blow to the Communist Party!

May 25

For many days, I have been learning about the ghost issue of correctly understanding humanitarianism, which leaves people with no time at all. Several times I wanted to pretend to be sick and rest, but that damned doctor also went against me and wouldn't give me a sick leave, hindering my work! Damn it, I will definitely use you to open the knife and sacrifice the flag in the future.

The cadres of the labor camp are all a bunch of useless people. No wonder some people say that Communist Party members are all "incompetent" people, which is the truth. These people were just poor devils who used to hold hoes and carry shoulder poles for hundreds of generations. They have been showing off their power with guns for the past few years. Maybe three days or two mornings from now, we will have to step on them again!

May 27

At breakfast, the loudspeaker suddenly announced: "Anti-American demonstrations broke out in Taiwan." My God! Is this true? No, Taiwan is a small place, heavily guarded internally and defended by the Seventh Fleet externally, and has the national policy of "giving to foreign friends rather than domestic slaves." The Americans will not sit idly by and watch this rebellion, and Chairman Chiang will not spare these rebellious subjects.

The newspaper was posted with a seven-line headline, which shows that the Communist Party is using this event to shift the target and escape the crisis it faces. I am an expert in this.

However, my emotions were disturbed. Taiwan, my dear hope! May God bless you peace and safety, Amen.

June 1

Today is a good day.

I got the names of the Communist Party members from the cadre club.

Some time ago, I went there to carry large benches and saw the published list of Party members paying their dues. Recently, I suddenly thought that this was a useful thing. Today I came and grabbed it, tore it off, stuffed it into my pocket and brought it back. When we start the inside and outside cooperation, the Communist Party members must be killed.

The Taiwan incident has slowly calmed down. However, these labor reform activists are still promoting it with great fanfare, carrying signing boards and looking for prisoners everywhere to sign, saying that they are supporting the just struggle of the Taiwanese compatriots, but they are asking us to improve production efficiency by 5%, which is outrageous! I didn't expect there to be so many fake activists in the labor camp. They seem to know nothing about what has happened in society? These ungrateful bastards, working as accomplices, are extremely shameless! If they don't turn back, they will also be subject to the death penalty, and not one of them will be spared.

June 3

Today I saw Chu Anping's speech in Guangming Daily, which is the most enjoyable article I have ever seen. Chu Anping... "sharply" criticized the "Party's world" practice. He is truly a hero, truly a good man!

However, Mr. Chu is still too weak, his face is gloomy and not bright enough. He should add some gunpowder. Mr. Chu, I hope you continue to move forward, raise the flag higher, and sharpen the sword more!

June 4

I just saw the People's Daily of May 31st today. My God, my God! The flames of struggle have been ignited, the horn of attack has been sounded, and the great Mr. Ge Peiqi and Mr. Wang Dezhou have issued an anti-communist declaration!

No one can describe how intensely my heart is beating, and no one can describe how my blood is surging. The moment I have been waiting for day and night is coming. "Ninety-something percent of Communist Party members are doing all kinds of evil"! I can testify that in 1951 they shot many people, confiscated my land, and my several concubines also left me. Now they are still making me sit in prison. In the past, we killed communists, and we did the right thing. Now, we have to do it again.

I read their speeches several times and carefully considered them, and suddenly felt something was wrong again. It is right for the Communist Party to make mistakes, incite discontent, and provoke their relationship with workers and peasants. But why say that people's lives have not improved and others will not sell the country? Alas! It's bad, it's bad! People still remember those days of losing power and humiliating the country, and people did not have a livelihood. Mentioning the past will ruin things. I didn't expect that as a university teacher, he would not have considered this issue and would be seen through by others all at once. Idiot!

    一个犯人的日记
    编者按　这份“日记”，是湖北省公安厅新生砖瓦厂刑满释放留厂就业的分子刘炳坤写的。这份“日记”，充分地暴露了一些反革命分子对于共产党和人民政府有着何等深刻的阶级仇恨。在我们强大的专政机器面前，他们表面上似乎已低头认罪，但在内心深处，却完全是另一回事。因此，当着资产阶级右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，他们就跃跃欲试，企图“里应外合”，进行反革命复辟活动。
    反革命分子可以从反面来教育我们，现在特将这份“日记”发表出来，请一些自以为天下太平可以高枕无忧的同志们看看，我们应当怎样的提高警惕，来对待这些死不悔悟的反革命分子。
    五月十日
    看了今天的报纸，我才恍然大悟。原来共产党宣布整风，是因为和民主人士闹了别扭，起了摩擦，借以改善关系而已。程千帆等人的发言，如怨如诉，一肚子苦水，仿佛倒不完似的。这真叫活该！想当年，他们这不满意，那不满意，只恨我们不垮台，现在美国人走了，我们垮了，这些人也并不能一步登天，现在该明白了吧！
    “文人无行”，自古皆然，是不会讨任何人喜欢的。
    五月十五日
    十三号的人民日报社论“谈职工闹事”，共产党承认有罢工有游行请愿了。这真是天大的好消息！好啊！万岁，万岁！共产党快要垮台了！
    怪不得人民日报最近接二连三地登载社论，要正确处理人民内部矛盾，是民众不信赖他们了。有矛盾，当然就有冲突；有冲突，当然就有战乱；上帝，但愿得匈牙利事件早日在中国降临，让那火焰烧遍世界，让那血水泛滥全球！
    这几年，我们也真苦够了，六年来的阶下之囚，皆是八年前的座上之客，劳改队里，恨共产党的人多，得着手组织组织，有时自有一番事业可干。
    五月十六日
    陈铭枢要求共产党取消党委制，的确，这是一个大胆的意见，不失有大将军的气魄。好！又给共产党一闷棍！
    五月二十五日
    好多天来，光在学习什么正确认识人道主义的鬼问题，弄得人没有一点儿时间。好几次我要装病休息一下，狗×的医生也和我作对，不开条子，妨碍我的工作！妈的×，将来老子非拿你开刀祭旗不可。
    劳改队的干部，净是一些饭桶，怪不得有人说共产党员都是些“无才”之辈，真乃是一句实话。这些人，过去都不过是一些拿锄头扛扁担的几百辈子穷鬼，靠枪杆子抖了这几年威风，说不定三天还是两早晨，我们还得把他们踩到脚底下去！
    五月二十七日
    早饭时候，忽然广播器里广播说：“台湾暴发了反美大示威”。我的天啊！这是真的吗？不会，台湾这弹丸之地，内有重兵镇守，外有第七舰队协防，又有那“宁送友邦，不予家奴”的国策，这点叛乱，美国人不会坐视，委座也不会饶恕这些乱臣贼子的。
    报纸贴出来了，标题是用七行大字，可见共产党是用这个事件，转移一下目标，来逃避面临的危机，这一套，我是内行。
    但是，情绪被扰乱了。台湾哟，我亲爱的希望！愿上帝保佑你平平安安，阿门。
      六月一日
    今天算得是个好日子。
    我从干部俱乐部里，把共产党员的名字给弄来了。
    前些日子，我去那里抬大凳子，看见公布的党员缴党费名单，近日来，我忽然想到这是个有用的东西，今天来个顺手牵羊，撕下来塞进口袋里就带回来了。等里应外合动手之时，共产党员是一定要杀光的。
    台湾事件，慢慢地平静下去了。倒是这些劳改积极分子，还是宣传得有声有色，抬着签名牌，到处找犯人签名，说是支援台湾同胞的正义斗争，却叫我们提高生产效率5％，真是岂有此理！没想到劳改队（里）也有这么多假积极分子。他们似乎对社会上已经发生了些什么事都不知道？这些忘了本的狗东西，为虎作伥，真是无耻之尤！假如再不回头，将来也有一刀之罪，一个也不饶。
      六月三日
    今天看到光明日报上登的储安平的发言，这是我看到的顶过瘾的文章。储安平……“尖锐”地指责“党天下”的做法，真是英雄，真是好汉！
    不过，储先生还太懦弱，面孔阴暗，不够明朗，应该再加点火药味道。储先生，希望你继续前进，把旗子挑得更高，把宝剑磨得更加锋利才好。
      六月四日
    五月三十一日的人民日报，今天才看到。天哪，天哪！斗争的烽火已经点燃，冲击的号角已经吹响，伟大的葛佩琦先生和王德周先生发出了反共的檄文！
    谁也不能形容我的心是多么激烈的跳动，谁也无法描写我的血液是怎样的奔腾。我日夜盼望的时刻就要到了。“共产党员，百分之九十几是无恶不作的”！我可以做见证，1951年他们枪毙了不少人，没收了我的田产，我的几个小老婆也不跟我了，现在还叫我蹲监狱，过去我们杀共产党，做对了，现在，我们还要这样干的。
    我把他们两个人的发言，看了几遍，细细琢磨一下，忽然又感到不对头了。共产党有错误，煽动不满，挑拨他们和工、农群众的关系，是对的。可是为什么要说：人民生活没有提高，别人也不会卖国这些话呢？哎！坏了坏了！过去那些丧权辱国，民不聊生的日子，人们都还记得，提起了过去就要坏事的，没想到身为大学教师，会没有考虑这个问题，一家伙就会被别人看穿了的。笨蛋！
