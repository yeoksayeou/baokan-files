    The Signal of the First Artificial Earth Satellite
    Guo Moruo

    The first artificial Earth satellite is revolving around the Earth day and night, constantly sending a signal: the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution is approaching in an instant. This festival is a new era in human history, the working people have become masters, mastered their own destiny, and completely overthrown the slave regime of the old era. Forty years is not that long, it was only recently that intercontinental ballistic missiles were made, and then there is this new moon of mine circling in the sky. People all over the world are cheering and celebrating that world peace is guaranteed, and celebrating that all mankind can increase happiness; only a small handful of warmongers are in a hurry and refuse to admit defeat. They said long ago that they would occupy the moon, but now they are afraid that the moon will be occupied by others; international law has long become waste paper, and they are worrying about interstellar law. At the same time, they are manipulating Turkey to invade the border of Syria. The warmongers' arrogance is really ridiculous, but the paper tiger can't scare people after all. Sooner or later someone will stroll on the moon, but no one is allowed to touch a hair of Syria. The Arab people are as strong as steel, closely, closely united. The Soviet Union and China stand by Syria's side, and peace-loving people all over the world have long formed a front to defend peace. People are shouting: those who play with fire will burn themselves, who dares to take risks in the atomic age?! Tell you, the accomplice of Turkey! You should still remember the story of Shangganling, you should still remember the story of Suez, what is the end of the aggressor? You are taking chestnuts from the fire for the American warmongers, and the people of the world will not allow you! Even the Americas are no longer a paradise, let alone you are next to the fortress of peace? Your profession of being an accomplice should be abandoned, don't treat Syria as Korea again! If you want to exchange the blood of the Arab people for more American gold coins, the Turkish people will also give you—hold a final trial." The first artificial Earth satellite is sending signals day and night, for defending peace and stopping aggression, its call is the loudest. The warmongers are the most unhappy with it, but its call cannot be erased. People all over the world are cheering for the satellite, people all over the world are cheering for the Soviet Union, forty years of achievement are truly unparalleled in ancient and modern times! A new chapter has been added to human history: mankind has begun to evolve from Earth creatures to cosmic creatures. Here comes a clear contrast: on one side is armed threat and conspiracy to subvert; on the other side is superb technology and peaceful creation; on one side is the US Sixth Fleet sailing to Turkey to support it, on the other side is the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite leisurely roaming in the sky day and night. The satellite of peace is shining right above our heads. The satellite is moving, and the rocket is also moving. The brilliance of the satellite shines all over the seven continents, and the rocket will burn all the conspiracies of the aggressors. The congratulations of all mankind are directed towards Moscow, it is time for the warmongers to wake up.

    第一个人造地球卫星的讯号
    郭沫若 第一个人造地球卫星日日夜夜在绕着地球旋转，它不断地发出讯号：十月革命四十周年纪念已经迫近在转瞬之间。这个节日是人类历史的新纪元，劳动人民作了主人，掌握了自己的命运，把旧时代的奴役政权彻底推翻。四十年的时间并不那么长远，才不久制成洲际导弹火箭，接着就是我这新月亮在天上回旋。全世界的人民都在欢欣鼓舞，庆祝世界和平有了保障，庆祝全人类可以增加幸福；就只有一小撮战争贩子们，他们在干着急而又死不服输。他们早就说要去占领月球，而今又怕月球被人去占领；国际公法都早已成为废纸，他们又在星际公法上操心。而同时又在操纵着土耳其，要它侵略进叙利亚的边境。战争贩子们的猖狂实在可笑，然而纸老虎毕竟把人骇不倒。月球是早迟有人去蹓跶的，叙利亚却不准谁去动一根毫毛，阿拉伯人民已经像钢铁一样，紧密地，紧密地，团结在一道。苏联和中国都站在叙利亚一边，全世界爱好和平的人民早就结成了一条保卫和平的战线。人们在高呼：玩火者必自焚，有谁敢在原子能时代冒险？！告诉你，土耳其的帮凶者！你应该还记得上甘岭的故事，你应该还记得苏伊士的故事，侵略者的末路是什么样子？你替美国好战者火中取栗，全世界的人民都不允许你！就连美洲都已经不是世外桃源，何况你是在和平堡垒的旁边？你的帮凶专业应该抛弃了，不要又把叙利亚当成朝鲜！如果你要以阿拉伯人民的血去换取更多的美国金元，土耳其人民也会给予你——举行一次最后的审判。”第一个人造地球卫星日日夜夜在发出讯号，为保卫和平、制止侵略，它发出的呼声最高。战争贩子们就最不高兴它，然而把它的呼声抹杀不了。全世界的人民在为卫星欢呼，全世界的人民在为苏联欢呼，四十年的成就真真冠绝今古！人类历史又添上了新的一章：人类已开始从地球生物进化成为宇宙生物。在这里来了个鲜明的对照：一边是武装威胁、阴谋颠覆；一边是科技高超、和平创造；一边是美国的第六舰队纷纷驶向土耳其去撑腰，一边是苏联的第一个人造卫星日日夜夜在天空中逍遥。和平的卫星已经照在当头。卫星在走，火箭也在走，卫星的光辉照遍了七大洲，火箭会烧毁一切侵略者的阴谋。全人类的祝贺都向往莫斯科，是战争贩子们清醒的时候。
