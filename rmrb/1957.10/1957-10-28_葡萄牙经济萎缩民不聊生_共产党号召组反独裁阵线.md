    Xinhua News Agency, October 27th -- According to a report in the Argentinian newspaper "Nuestra Palabra," on the eve of the parliamentary elections to be held in Portugal in November, the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party recently held a meeting to analyze the current domestic situation in Portugal, and reiterated that all national democratic forces must unite and mobilize all those dissatisfied with the current regime to form a national front against the Salazar dictatorship.
    The document issued at the end of the meeting pointed out that the Portuguese economy is shrinking and national industry is stagnating. Mining, the textile industry, construction, paper making, and cork manufacturing are all drastically reducing production. More than 60,000 textile workers are unemployed or semi-unemployed. On the other hand, government military expenditures are extremely large. From 1945 to 1954, military spending rose to tens of billions of escudos, which is more than twice the total expenditure planned for economic development from 1953 to 1958.
    Under the Salazar regime, the living standards of the working people are low. According to official statistics, from 1939 to 1956, the cost of living rose by 150%, while wages increased by an average of less than 50%. In addition, the continuous intensification of labor, the threat of unemployment and semi-unemployment, and inadequate medical conditions have all exacerbated their plight.
    In reiterating the organization of a national front against the Salazar dictatorship, the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party put forward a minimum program: to improve the people's living standards; to defend the national economy and oppose the government's monopoly policy; to pursue an independent policy of maintaining friendly economic and diplomatic relations with all countries; to restore democratic freedoms; and to grant amnesty to political prisoners.

    葡萄牙经济萎缩民不聊生
    共产党号召组反独裁阵线
    新华社27日讯　据阿根廷“我们的话报”报道，在葡萄牙即将在11月举行议会选举的前夕，葡萄牙共产党中央委员会最近举行了会议，分析了目前葡萄牙的国内形势，并且重申全国民主力量必须联合起来，动员一切不满现政权的人们组成一个反对萨拉查独裁政权的全国阵线。
    会议结束时所发表的文件指出，葡萄牙经济萎缩、民族工业处于停滞状态。矿业、纺织工业、建筑业、造纸、软木制造业都在大量缩减生产。有六万以上的纺织工人失业或半失业。而另一方面，政府军事开支却异常庞大。从1945年到1954年，军费上升到一百几十亿盾，这比预定在1953年到1958年用于发展经济的全部开支多一倍以上。
    在萨拉查政权统治下，劳动人民生活水平低下。据官方统计，从1939年到1956年，生活费用上涨150％，而工资平均增加不到50％。此外，劳动强度的不断加强，失业和半失业的威胁，医疗条件不足等都加重了他们的苦境。
    葡萄牙共产党中央委员会在重申组织反对萨拉查独裁政权的全国阵线时提出了一个最低纲领：提高人民生活水平；保卫民族经济，反对政府垄断政策；奉行和所有国家保持友好的经济和外交关系的独立政策；恢复民主自由；大赦政治犯。
