Whether dawn or night, there is always a sound that stirs us, and that is the sound of our 600 million people marching forward.

This sound, not only in our ears but also in our hearts, has never stopped. In the years of war, how many such dawns and nights have we experienced! Sometimes, we stopped and listened to the sound of footsteps rushing past us, people heading straight for the flashing lights of artillery fire; then, when dawn broke, a red flag, like the earliest red glow, waved on the horizon, and people moved forward again. Today, the sound of building socialism is shaking our land. In these recent unforgettable days, we heard Chairman Mao quietly walking across the Yangtze River Bridge, accompanied by the sound of whistles, motors, and the rustling of harvesters' sickles, all racing against time.

It is with this roaring sound of creating a new world that we arrive at our ninth October 1st. Lenin said well when commemorating the October Revolution: "The farther away this great day is from us, the more obvious the significance of the Russian proletarian revolution becomes." Indeed, everything in our lives has taken on new meaning and new brilliance since that most precious day of ours. Therefore, every time we commemorate this day, we must examine our work, accelerate our pace, and increase our spirit of progress. In the "Internationale" there is such a line: "We shall be all masters of the world." Life has always been created by us through labor, and at the same time we are creating new people through labor. Here I want to talk about one construction among all constructions, which is the work of building the human soul. Commemorating this year's National Day has special and exciting significance for each of us engaged in literary work. Establishing socialist literature and art, and establishing a contingent of working-class writers and artists, has been clearly put forward in this fierce socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The socialist era demands that our writers and artists be able to help the masses promote historical progress with literary and artistic weapons in the life of building socialism. Our era has the right and the qualifications to demand musical, artistic, and literary works that match it and are forever remembered in people's hearts. If we who are engaged in literary and artistic work are worthy of being called socialist literary and artistic workers, first of all, we must be able to freely sing about our socialist new life. This requires us to truly understand the creators of our era—the working masses of workers and peasants; this requires us to have the thoughts, feelings, and moral qualities of the working people, otherwise your singing cannot become the voice of the people's hearts. You will not be able to sing the song of the socialist era. Of course, new forces of literary and artistic work will emerge from the rich reality struggle. They will bring various passions of construction struggle in life, and also bring various distinct artistic colors to enrich the strength of our socialist literature and art. However, those who are already working in literary and artistic work can only devote themselves wholeheartedly to the ocean of labor and creative life, and closely integrate themselves with the people, in order to truly grasp their own creative destiny, in order to achieve fruitful harvests for our socialist culture, and in order to truly become a member of the working-class literary and artistic team. From the boundless countryside to factories and mines, our working people are tirelessly advancing on the road of progress and more progress, creating wealth for the socialist motherland. This is material wealth, and it is also spiritual wealth. This is a torrent of labor and wisdom that no force can stop. We believe that the victory of the anti-rightist struggle on the ideological front this year will surely determine the new face of our literary and artistic work. But in this new critical period, what is a decisive step for us? That is to go to the masses! Go to the heated struggle of construction life! Socialist literature and art, and the working-class literary and artistic team, will surely be generated and grow on the vast road of 600 million people advancing.

People hope that whether dawn or night, our writers and artists will breathe and advance together with the people; people hope that whether dawn or night, there will be beautiful songs singing about our socialist life, soaring high at the forefront of the advancing ranks.

    无论黎明或夜晚……
    刘白羽
    无论黎明或夜晚，总有一种声音在激动着我们，这就是我们六万万人民前进的声音。
    这声音，不但在我们耳边而且在我们心里，从来没有停止过。在战争的年月里，我们经历过多少这样的黎明与夜晚呀！有时，我们站下来，倾听着从身旁涌过去的脚步声，人们直奔炮火闪光的地方而去；然后，当曙光照临时，一面红旗又像最早的一片红霞一样在地平线上招展，人们又向前进了。今天，建设社会主义的声音震动着我们的大地，在最近这些令人永远难忘的日子里，我们听见毛主席静静地走过长江大桥的脚步声，伴和着这声音的是各处的汽笛声、马达声、收割者的镰刀的沙沙声，它们都在和时间竞赛。
    我们就是这样带着创造新世界的轰响来到我们的第九个十月一日。列宁在纪念十月革命节时说得好：“这个伟大的日子离我们愈远，俄国无产阶级革命的意义就愈加明显。”正是如此，我们生活中的一切从我们的那个最可珍贵的日子开始起都有了新的意义、新的光彩。因此，每当我们纪念这个日子时，都要检验我们的工作，加速我们的步伐，增加了我们前进的锐气。在“国际歌”中有那样一句歌词：“我们要作天下的主人”，生活从来是我们用劳动来创造的，同时我们又在劳动当中创造了新的人。在这儿我想谈到，在一切建设中的一项建设，就是建设人的灵魂的工作。纪念今年的国庆节，对我们每一从事文学工作的人，有着令人特别兴奋的意义。建立社会主义文艺，建立工人阶级文艺队伍，已在这一场剧烈的政治战线上、思想战线上的社会主义革命斗争中鲜明地提了出来。社会主义时代要求着我们的文学家艺术家们能在建设社会主义的生活当中，用文艺武器帮助群众推动历史前进。我们的时代，有权利、有资格要求足以与它相衬的、永远记在人们心中的音乐、美术和文学的作品。如果我们作文学艺术工作的人配得上称为社会主义的文学艺术工作者，首先我们要能自由地歌唱我们的社会主义的新生活。这就要求我们真正的熟悉我们这个时代的创造者——工农劳动群众；这就要求我们具有劳动人民的思想感情、道德品质，否则你的歌声不能成为人民心灵上的声音。你也就唱不出社会主义时代的歌声。当然，从丰富的现实斗争中会涌现出文艺工作的新生力量，他们会带着生活中建设斗争的种种激情，同时也带着种种鲜明的艺术色彩，来充实我们社会主义文艺的力量；但是，现在已经在文学艺术工作岗位上工作着的人，也只有全心身地投入到劳动创造的生活海洋中去，把自己与人民紧紧结合起来，才能真正地掌握着自己的创作命运，才能为我们社会主义文化取得丰盛的收获，也才能真正成为工人阶级文艺队伍中的一员。从无边无际的农村到工厂、矿山，我们的劳动人民在日夜不息地前进更前进的道路上，在为社会主义祖国创造着财富，这是物质的财富，同时也是精神的财富，这是任何力量也阻挡不住的劳动与智慧的洪流。我们相信，今年在思想战线上进行的反右派斗争的胜利，必将决定我们文学艺术工作的新面貌。但在这新的关键时期，什么是我们有决定意义的一个步骤呢？那就是到群众中去！到建设生活的火热斗争中去！社会主义文艺、工人阶级文艺队伍，必将在六万万人民前进的辽阔的道路上生成与壮大。
    人们希望着：无论黎明或夜晚，我们的文学家艺术家们都和人民一起呼吸、一起前进；人们希望着：无论黎明或夜晚，有优美的歌唱我们社会主义生活的歌声，在前进行列的最前面高声飘荡。
