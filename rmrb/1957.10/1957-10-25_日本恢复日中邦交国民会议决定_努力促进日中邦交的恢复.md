Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th - The National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations held a meeting of its standing directors today, deciding to fully support the joint statement issued on October 10th by the delegation of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations visiting China and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and to launch a national movement to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations in accordance with its spirit. The meeting decided to hold a report meeting of the delegation of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations visiting China in Tokyo on December 4th, to hear the delegation's report on its visit to China, and to launch a signature campaign across Japan during the same period to demand the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations.
    All attendees unanimously agreed that it is very important to uphold the agreement reached in Tianjin under the current circumstances where the Japanese government neglects and undermines the agreement, forcing Japanese women married to Chinese people who returned to visit their families to be in a very difficult situation. The meeting decided to strive to enable these Japanese women who returned to visit their families to return to China as soon as possible.
    More than 40 representatives of various groups participating in the National Council, including the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Socialist Party, and the Japanese Communist Party, attended today's meeting.

    日本恢复日中邦交国民会议决定
    努力促进日中邦交的恢复
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本恢复日中邦交国民会议今天举行常任理事会会议，决定全面支持日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华使节团同中国人民外交学会10月10日发表的共同声明，并且决定遵照它的精神展开恢复日中邦交的国民运动。会议决定在12月4日在东京举行日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华使节团报告会，听取使节团访问中国的报告，并且在同一个时期在日本全国展开征集要求恢复日中邦交的签名。
    全体与会者一致认为，在日本政府忽视和破坏在天津达成的协议，迫使回国探亲的同中国人结婚的日本妇女处于非常困难的境地的现况下，拥护这个协议是很重要的。会议决定要努力促使这些回国探亲的日本妇女能够早日回中国。
    日本工会总评议会、社会党、日本共产党等参加国民会议的各团体代表四十多人出席了今天的会议。
