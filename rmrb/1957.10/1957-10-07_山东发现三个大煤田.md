    Shandong Discovers Three Large Coalfields
    (Our dispatch) The No. 123 Prospecting Team of the East China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau has discovered three large coalfields this year in the Jinan-to-Xuecheng area of Shandong Province. One is the Feicheng Coalfield, which is 23 kilometers long from east to west and 4 kilometers wide from north to south, covering an area of ​​more than 90 square kilometers. The total thickness of the coal seam is 5.36 meters. The coal quality is good and it has been preliminarily identified as industrial coal. Based on the coal-bearing strata and distribution, it is estimated that the reserves are more than 500 million tons. The second is the Tengxian Coalfield, which covers an area of ​​approximately 400 square kilometers, with estimated reserves of up to 1 billion tons. The third is the Jining Coalfield, which is 60 kilometers long from east to west and 10 kilometers wide from north to south, covering an area of ​​600 square kilometers.
    These three large coalfields are all close to the Jinpu Railway, making transportation extremely convenient.
