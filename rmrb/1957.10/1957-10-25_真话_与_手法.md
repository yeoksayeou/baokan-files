"Truth" and "Techniques"

Following the Soviet Union's successful launch of the first artificial satellite, the United States suddenly announced on the 16th of this month the transfer of the current Director of the United States Information Agency (USIA), Mr. Larson, to the position of Special Assistant to the President, responsible for plans and activities related to countering Soviet propaganda. The position of Director of the USIA will be filled by Mr. George Allen, who previously served as Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs and is currently the Ambassador to Greece. This personnel change clearly indicates that after the bankruptcy of its "policy of strength," the United States intends to intensify its slander against the Soviet Union and deceptive propaganda directed towards the people of the Near East, Southeast Asia, and Africa, in order to diminish the impact of the Soviet Union's successful satellite launch on international politics.

However, can these two "generals," carefully selected by Eisenhower, truly accomplish this mission?

Under Larson's leadership, the USIA can be said to have reached a dead end. In a report published on the 13th of this month, regarding the propaganda of "American racial problems," it helplessly admitted that although it had made special efforts to cover up the discrimination suffered by Black people in the country and to promote "progress" in race relations in the United States, these propagandas could not offset the effect of reports in many foreign newspapers about the truth of racial discrimination in the United States.

This is reminiscent of a speech Larson made at a meeting of all USIA staff at the end of July this year. At this mobilization meeting, Larson loudly called on the staff of the agency to establish as high as possible "credibility" for the USIA in the future. How to establish "credibility"? Larson believed that attention should be paid to the content and tone of the propaganda, to explain the "truth," and to speak the "truth" in such a way that people all over the world would believe that the USIA was not engaged in propaganda. He said, "Although the USIA has always told the truth, in order to make people believe this truth, we must pay more attention to propaganda techniques." In order to illustrate the correctness of his point of view, Larson also repeatedly mentioned that Eisenhower and Dulles fully agreed with this view. According to this, the USIA seems to have always been telling the "truth," and the problem lies only in the "techniques."

If it is telling the truth, then it is speaking according to the facts. Facts are the easiest to convince people, so why pay attention to "techniques"? The problem is obviously not here. Recent facts have proved this. The day after the Soviet Union successfully launched the artificial satellite, the USIA hurriedly issued a "news policy" notice, stipulating that "Voice of America" and American news agencies abroad should only promote this as a great victory in world science and not talk about its military significance. This is Larson's so-called "truth," but the fact is not so. If the successful launch of the artificial satellite was only a scientific achievement, American politicians and military figures would not have been so alarmed. The American "Stone Weekly" admitted that the successful launch of the artificial satellite had significant military significance. In an article on October 14, it said: "The cornerstone of American post-war policy has collapsed overnight. Deterrence is over." This fact is seen by everyone. Therefore, the USIA's propaganda has failed again.

It can be seen that Larson's emphasis on propaganda "techniques" is not accidental. The main skill of all American propaganda machines is to use some "techniques" to turn lies into "truths" and deceive the American and world people. However, a donkey is always a donkey, and it is useless to decorate it with gold. This set of "techniques" of the American propaganda machine has long been seen through by the people. Neither Larson nor Allen, or the two of them together, can deceive the people. Because what the people believe in is the truth, and what the American ruling group and its mouthpiece can provide is nothing more than lies plus "techniques."

### “真话”与“手法”

    “真话”与“手法”
    苏联发射第一颗人造卫星成功以后，美国忽然在本月16日宣布把现在的美国新闻署署长拉森调任总统特别助理，负责有关对付苏联宣传的计划和活动。美国新闻署署长一职，则由曾经担任过美国国务院的负责近东、南亚和非洲事务的助理国务卿、现任驻希腊大使乔治·艾伦担任。这一次人事调动，很清楚地说明美国在“实力政策”破产以后，打算加强对苏联的诬蔑和对近东、东南亚和非洲人民进行欺骗宣传，来削弱苏联发射人造卫星成功所产生的对国际政治的影响。
    不过，这两位由艾森豪威尔精心选择的“大将”真能完成这项使命吗？
    美国新闻署在拉森的领导下，可以说是到了山穷水尽的境地了。它在本月13日发表的一项报告中谈到关于“美国种族问题”的宣传时，就无可奈何地招认：它虽然特别努力想掩盖美国黑人在国内受到的歧视，宣传美国在种族关系方面的“进步”，但是这些宣传一点也不能抵销许多外国报纸关于美国种族歧视的真相的报道所起的作用。
    这使人联想到拉森今年7月底在美国新闻署全体工作人员会议上的一次讲话。拉森在这个动员会议上大声疾呼，要该署的工作人员今后给美国新闻署建立尽可能高的“信誉”。如何建立“信誉”呢？拉森认为要注意宣传的内容与口气，要说明“真相”，要把“真话”讲得使全世界人民相信美国新闻署并不是在进行宣传。他说“虽然美国新闻署一直是讲真话的，但要把真话讲得使人相信这一点，必须加倍注意宣传手法”。拉森为了说明他的论点的正确，还多次谈到艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯完全同意这种看法。照这样说来，美国新闻署似乎一直就是讲“真话”的，问题只是在于“手法”。
    既然是讲真话，那就是照事实说话。事实是最容易说服人的，为什么还要注意“手法”呢？问题显然不在这里。最近的事实就证明了这一点。在苏联发射人造卫星成功的第二天，美国新闻署就急急忙忙发了一个“新闻政策”通知，规定“美国之音”和美国驻外新闻机关只宣传这是世界科学的一个巨大胜利，不要谈它在军事上的意义。这就是拉森的所谓“真话”，可是事实却不是这样。如果人造卫星发射成功仅仅是科学上的成就，美国政界和军方的人士就用不着那么惊慌万状了。美国“斯通周刊”就承认人造卫星发射成功的具有重大军事意义。它在10月14日的一篇文章中说：“美国战后政策的基石一夜之间就崩溃了。威慑手段已经完蛋。”这个事实是大家都看到的。因此，美国新闻署的宣传又失败了。
    可见，拉森强调宣传“手法”不是偶然的。美国所有宣传机器的主要本事，就是用一些“手法”来把假话说成是“真话”，欺骗美国和世界人民。可是，驴总是驴，用黄金装饰也无用。美国宣传机器这一套“手法”早已被人们识破了。无论是拉森或者艾伦，或者他们两人加在一起，都骗不了人民。因为人民所相信的是真话，而美国统治集团和它的喉舌所能提供的却不过是假话加上“手法”。
