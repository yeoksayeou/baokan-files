　　National Water Polo Championship Held in Beijing
　　(Our report) The 1957 National Water Polo Championship began today (20th) at the Beijing Gymnasium. Thirteen teams from twelve units, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanning, Wuzhou, Xiamen, Lushun-Dalian, Changchun, Zhanjiang, Chongqing, Tianjin, Nanchang, and the People's Liberation Army, are participating in this competition, with a total of more than 160 athletes. Some of these teams are long-established and have rich competition experience, such as the People's Liberation Army team and the Guangzhou team, while others are emerging forces in water polo, such as the Nanning team and the Wuzhou team.
　　The competition is expected to end on the 30th. The thirteen teams will compete in thirty-six games over eleven days.
　　This National Water Polo Championship is the largest national water polo competition since liberation. A National Water Polo Demonstration was held in 1955, a Water Polo Championship was held at the National Aquatic Sports Meet in 1956, and a Four-Unit Water Polo Tournament was held in April this year, but those three competitions were not as large, numerous, or regionally broad as this competition, whether in terms of scale, number of athletes, or regional breadth of the teams.

　　全国水球锦标赛在北京举行
    本报讯  1957年全国水球锦标赛，今天（20日）起在北京体育馆开始举行。参加这次比赛的有上海、广州、南宁、梧州、厦门、旅大、长春、湛江、重庆、天津、南昌和解放军等十二个单位的十三个代表队（广州有两个队参加），共有运动员一百六十多名。这些代表队有的是成立较久比赛经验较丰富的劲旅，如解放军队、广州队等，有的还是水球队伍中的新生力量，如南宁队、梧州队等。
    比赛预计在30日结束。十三个代表队将在十一天中进行三十六场比赛。
    这次全国水球锦标赛是解放后规模最大的一次全国性的水球比赛。在1955年举行过全国水球表演赛，1956年在全国水上运动会上举行过水球锦标赛，今年4月又举行过四单位水球对抗赛，但那三次比赛无论在规模上、运动员人数上或代表队的区域广泛性上，都不如这次比赛这样大、多和广泛。
