What Kind of Ferry to Take?
　　Yang Dongchun

　　In 1947, in the tenth issue of the old "Observer" Volume II, in order to commemorate the May Fourth Youth Day, Fei Xiaotong published a letter to his "Brother Anping" entitled "Roads Not Arranged." The letter stated: "I am very afraid that future reviewers of China's history in the past half-century will condemn us, the generation around forty years old today, because we only take pre-arranged roads and do not arrange new roads for the next generation." When he wrote this letter, it was on the eve of the great counter-offensive by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and he felt a shiver of fear when he realized that the road he was taking was different from that of the vast majority of young people. He saw the young people as "naive, radical, obsessed, and possessed," while he was "mature, prudent, detached, and indifferent." His class instincts made him separate himself from the youth, from the people, and from the times, and he could not help but feel lonely. He wanted to lure the young people to take the road he had designed—a "new road" that deviated from the revolution. The young people did not listen to him, and he felt even more frightened, like a ghost.

　　Ten years later, in March and May 1957, Fei Xiaotong published two articles, "The Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals" and "Before and After Early Spring," in succession. He used enchanting words and circuitous writing to pour out his hatred for the Communist Party and the new society, and to vent his decadent personal individualism. He felt that there was no spring in our country, and the climate was so unsuitable for his constitution. Therefore, he styled himself as the "savior" of intellectuals, and used sweet words to entice, instigate, incite, and bewitch intellectuals to take the road of deviating from the Party and from socialism. The broad masses of intellectuals did not listen to him. This time, he was not only lonely, but also became a rat running across the street, chased and beaten by everyone under the fierce attacks of the broad revolutionary intellectual circles and the people. Time is so ruthless! Ten years ago, Fei Xiaotong was afraid of being "condemned" like a thief, but ten years later, it finally came. History is the most just judge, and it is judging Fei Xiaotong and his gang of intellectual scum.

　　The Working Class Stand and the Bourgeois Stand

　　In his poisonous weed article, Fei Xiaotong poured out bewitching soup for intellectuals, fundamentally opposing the ideological remolding of intellectuals, that is, opposing the idea that intellectuals should essentially transform their class stand. Everyone knows that the issue of stand is a fundamental issue for the ideological remolding of intellectuals. Intellectuals themselves are not a class, but only a specific social stratum attached to the "skin" of a certain class and serving that class. Generally speaking, if intellectuals serve a certain class, they must take the stand of that class and defend the interests of that class. The old Chinese intellectuals, from a general point of view, came from the bourgeoisie and the landlord class, received bourgeois education for a long time, and served the bourgeoisie for a long time. Therefore, it is scientific and realistic to call them bourgeois intellectuals and say that they take the bourgeois stand. However, under the specific historical conditions of China, because the Chinese national bourgeoisie could participate in or sympathize with the new democratic revolution to a certain extent during a certain period, that is, during the democratic revolution, by taking the bourgeois stand, the Chinese national bourgeoisie could still participate in this revolution or remain neutral. Therefore, intellectuals who served the bourgeoisie and took the bourgeois stand could still join the revolutionary ranks and make certain contributions to the democratic revolution. This is the reason why the vast majority of old intellectuals could welcome the new and send off the old without much reluctance in the great revolutionary storm of the people. However, the revolution is moving forward. In present-day China, the socialist revolution to transform the ownership of the means of production has achieved a decisive victory, and the socialist system has been established. Therefore, the bourgeois stand and the capitalist ownership of the means of production have lost their revolutionary nature under certain historical conditions and have become reactionary things. Under such circumstances, the old intellectuals who served the bourgeoisie have lost their original material basis and class reliance, and should and must attach themselves to the "skin" of another class, serve another class, and take the stand of another class. This class is the emerging, vital working class. Although many intellectuals can accept this principle and are indeed pursuing progress subjectively, they are not so resolute in objective practice. A few people are very determined, took big steps, and completed or basically completed the fundamental transformation of their stand; the vast majority of people waver between the two stands, but basically still take the bourgeois stand, or the bourgeois stand dominates; a small number of people stubbornly hold on to the bourgeois stand and have fallen behind in the torrent of history, degenerating into today's bourgeois rightists.

　　When the Chinese Communist Party launched the rectification movement, many people in intellectual circles did feel a little confused and bewildered by the various opinions. They had no way to distinguish right from wrong, and their thinking fell into a state of confusion. After the anti-rightist struggle began, they again shrunk back, hesitated, and did not know what to do. This situation shows that the broad middle stratum of intellectuals is still far from completing the fundamental transformation of their political stand. This naturally shows that the ideological remolding of intellectuals is not as Fei Xiaotong said, that the issue of stand has been resolved; on the contrary, it tells us that the current serious problem of ideological remolding of intellectuals is still an acute issue of stand.

　　We all have a common feeling that the anti-rightist struggle is indeed the most rigorous test for us intellectuals. The Party tests us according to the principle that "the revolutionary consciousness of the masses should be cultivated in the storms of struggle and not in greenhouses." We should have a feeling of gratitude towards the strict teacher and should not have any complaints. If we do well in the test, we should not be arrogant and complacent, but should strive to work hard; if we do poorly in the test, or even hand in a blank paper, and have problems with our stand, it is a serious lesson. Of course, we feel heavy-hearted, but there is no reason to be discouraged. If we fall into confusion in our thinking for a while, slip to or completely roll over to the bourgeois stand, after a period of struggle, return to the truth and the correct stand, "learn from a fall, grow wiser." This should be understood as a good thing. This is because we have experienced "skin-deep pain," which enables us to demand more strictly of ourselves, strengthen ideological remolding, and transform our stand as soon as possible.

　　A Drop of Water Doctrine and a Book Doctrine

　　Fei Xiaotong's articles are permeated with the extremely individualistic sentiments of the bourgeoisie, which is essentially the same as Ding Ling's "one-book doctrine." Ding Ling believes that "as long as a person writes a book, no one can defeat them," and that "no matter how much work is done, it is meaningless, only writing a book is one's own." Ding Ling regards "a book" as capital for an individual to ascend to the royal throne. The greater the influence of this book, the more she believes her capital is abundant. This thoroughgoing selfish individualism is incompatible with the collectivism we require.

　　Individualism is the opposite of collectivism. From the perspective of the socio-economic foundation, individualism is the product of the private property system. The process of individuals breaking away from the collective is precisely the process of the disintegration of primitive communist society and entering into slave society, feudal society, and capitalist society. When society enters the era of socialism, individualism cannot but play a dirge and ring the death knell.

　　Individualists deny the power of the collective and the masses. In the eyes of individualists, the world is created by heroes, and the "rabble" can only play the role of cheering and waving flags. The collective serves the individual, and the collective exists for the sake of the individual's existence. All serious and fanatical individualists are historical idealists. They have only one "self" in their minds, and without the "self," all countries, societies, and nations lose their practical meaning.

　　The unique working conditions of intellectuals have formed their unique psychological state, the essential element of which is individualism. When a book is written, they believe it is their own achievement; when an invention or creation proves successful, they also believe it is their own achievement. They never think that it is the wisdom and labor of the people that provide them with rich nourishment in thought, and that guarantee the success of their literary creations and scientific experiments. Since individualists are isolated from the masses and deny the grace of the masses in nurturing and raising them, they will not treat the working masses with comrade-like and equal treatment, and they are often in a state of confrontation with the masses and the collective. Ingratitude is the characteristic of individualism.

　　"Heaven punishes those who are not for themselves" is the firm belief of individualists. Individualists are self-centered, and their entire mind is focused on the word "I." In our era, such extremely fanatical individualists politically manifest themselves as extremely evil hegemons who say "those who obey me prosper, those who oppose me perish"; in dealing with people and handling work, they manifest themselves as irrational egoists who say "I would rather betray the world than let the world betray me"; in their relationship with the Party, they manifest themselves as philistines who "stand above the Party when I am successful, and stand outside the Party when I am frustrated." As this kind of thinking develops, the word "I" expands larger and larger, and the masses and the Party become smaller and smaller in comparison. If the Party wants to interfere with him, the masses want to criticize him, and the organization wants to supervise him, he will oppose interference, oppose criticism, and oppose supervision. In the end, he will inevitably fall into the dirty and smelly mire of anti-Party and anti-people and be unable to extricate himself. Therefore, it is said that individualists ultimately destroy the individual!

　　Among intellectuals, there are some who are particularly attached to their own shadows. They say, "When people reach middle age, they always like to carefully examine the footprints of the life path they have experienced. There are not many days left in this life, and the long years pass silently. They are unwilling and always want to leave something behind." This kind of argument is essentially similar to the "one-book doctrine." It needs to be explained that we are not opposed to the career ambition of intellectuals. We welcome intellectuals to write books and establish theories, and to make inventions and creations in various fields. But we want to see what kind of foundation this career ambition is built on. If it starts from the bourgeois concept of fame and position, we believe that this is a shameful individualistic act, which is completely unworthy of imitation.

　　Individualism is the product of the bourgeoisie's selfish ideas. The working class's selfless ideas will only produce collectivism. Everything of the individualist starts from the individual, and at the same time hopes that everything returns to the individual; everything of the collectivist starts from the collective, and ultimately returns to the collective. However, in the great collective, the individual's labor, wisdom, inventions, and creations will still be fairly evaluated by the entire society, his labor value will still be approved by the people, so that he can enjoy the most sublime, collective, and socially recognized honor. From the standpoint of the working class, the collective does not stifle the individual's labor and talent. However, without the Party and the collective, any individual can only be a piece of scrap. Integrating the individual's career into the collective career, Mr. Lu Xun is a great example. Mr. Lu Xun said, "Great buildings are always built up by stacking one piece of wood and one stone. Why not do this one piece of wood and one stone? I often do some piecemeal things for this reason." Sakyamuni Buddha said, "If you want to make a drop of water never dry, you must put it in the sea." This is a sentence full of profound wisdom. We should learn something from this sentence: If we want to never dry up, we must practice the drop of water doctrine and abandon the one-book doctrine.

　　Humility and Pride

　　Fei Xiaotong said, "What intellectuals care about most is how their knowledge is valued, whether it is appreciated and respected. This is more important than anything else for intellectuals." Fei Xiaotong repeatedly emphasized that only those with "real talent and practical learning" can be successful. It seems that only he is the most knowledgeable. Not only are the Party, workers, peasants, and veteran cadres "uneducated and unskilled," but also their estimation and attention to his knowledge is insufficient. Fei Xiaotong's arrogant and self-important expression is on paper. He wants to encourage the blind megalomania of intellectuals and wag their tails at the Party with this.

　　Selfishness and arrogance are twin chronic diseases of bourgeois intellectuals. The reason why we intellectuals are prone to make the mistake of pride, complacency, and arrogance is because we are confined to a small world all day long and have limited knowledge; it is because our way of thinking is one-sided, we do not understand objective reality, and we do not start from objective reality; it is because we are divorced from the masses and unwilling to learn from the masses; it is because we are easily satisfied with the status quo and are complacent with a little achievement. Sometimes, "there are no tigers in the mountains, and the monkeys call themselves kings," and individual heroism is particularly strong. Sometimes, when we encounter opponents stronger than us, we will say "great minds think alike," revealing a full-fledged Ah Q appearance. Sometimes, in the face of new things and new situations, we really feel that we can't do it, but we still want to save face and are afraid of damaging our prestige, so we push the reason why we can't do it onto objective reasons. All of these are manifestations of pride, complacency, and arrogance.

　　We admit that in our ranks of intellectuals, there are indeed some who are specialized in their profession and have expertise. The so-called senior intellectuals are senior in a certain specialized business, and only in this sense can they be called "experts." However, from the perspective of the entire social politics, from the perspective of the labor achievements of predecessors, from the perspective of the vast ocean of all class struggle knowledge and production struggle knowledge, senior intellectuals are not only not profound and erudite, but on the contrary, the more senior intellectuals are, the narrower their knowledge is. Mr. Lu Xun said, "The words of experts are often contradictory." The so-called "often contradictory" is precisely the consequence of "every trade is like a mountain." Experts in a certain industry show ignorance outside of their industry, contrary to the facts, which is not uncommon. Therefore, the Party and the people respect our expertise, but if we think we are great, it proves our arrogance and superficiality; if we think this is our "trump card" and wag our tails at the Party with it, it is an unforgivable crime.

　　The working class is different from us intellectuals. They are simple and unpretentious and never proud and complacent. They believe that making achievements is what they should do, it is not worth being proud of, and they should only strictly demand of themselves and make more and greater achievements. Therefore, the working class is never satisfied with the status quo and always moves forward. Why can the working class do this? This is because the working class has no personal plans and personal emotions, but always considers the collective cause.

　　Arrogant and complacent intellectuals have no one in their eyes and no Party in their eyes, and always put the relationship between individuals and the Party in an abnormal position. In fact, any achievement of any intellectual is the result of the Party's leadership, education, and the masses' upbringing. Using one's own small achievements as capital to be proud of the Party is an evil act of forgetting one's roots. The more knowledgeable and accomplished intellectuals are, the more they listen to the Party and the more humble and cautious they are. Mr. Lu Xun is the banner and main general of the Chinese New Culture Revolution. His superb attainments are universally recognized, but Lu Xun has always been humble. Obeying the Party's decisions is the organizational discipline that Lu Xun believes should be observed. Lu Xun openly admitted that his works were "literature by order." Whose order? The order of the proletariat, the order of the Party. If we intellectuals who have different degrees of pride and complacency use Lu Xun as a mirror to examine ourselves, we will be ashamed.

　　"A Room, Two Books" and the Storms of Struggle

　　Fei Xiaotong said that now intellectuals have put forward "new demands," and it is said that the "wish of many of his friends" is: "'A room, two books,' meaning to be able to quietly do homework." Fei Xiaotong said: "I think it is necessary to be quiet, to ease the tense atmosphere, and to read more books. This is the work of cultivating and fertilizing the soil. In order to bloom and bear fruit, it is impossible not to do this basic construction." Fei Xiaotong said that this is the enthusiasm of intellectuals to improve their business.

　　In fact, Fei Xiaotong is not really concerned about the demand of intellectuals to improve their business. He is luring intellectuals to break away from politics and not to transform their thinking, so that he can lead those bookish intellectuals by the nose. On this point, he performed an ugly farce of "burying silver three hundred taels here." He said with a guilty conscience: What is the inevitable connection between "a room, two books" and "not hearing about the affairs of the world"? There is not necessarily no newspaper and radio in the room, and why can't the books talk about the affairs of the world? Then, he said in an extremely arrogant and challenging tone: "Does the word 'quietly' arouse revulsion again? Does being quiet mean you can't be an activist?" After slandering our political life to his heart's content, he said his final conclusion: Intellectuals can only transform their thinking through "practice," and "practice is business," and "transforming through business, serving through business, there is politics everywhere in it." Therefore, "a room, two books" itself has politics. This is the absurd argument made by Fei Xiaotong in order to cancel ideological remolding! We have never denied that an intellectual who has basically solved the issue of stand can understand and master Marxism through business practice; however, we also believe that business is not equal to politics after all, and business serves a certain economic base and a certain political purpose. When many intellectuals have clearly not solved the issue of stand very well, Fei Xiaotong plays the lullaby of "business is equal to politics," which is ulterior motive. This lullaby has a history, and its ancestor is Hu Feng's "where there is life, there is struggle."

　　The slogan "a room, two books" has a certain seductive power, which caters to the appetite of some of our intellectuals. This is because old intellectuals are accustomed to the solitary and independent lifestyle of appreciating oneself, accustomed to the life of bright windows and clean desks, leisurely and carefree, and not accustomed to the tense battle life. We intellectuals always have the idea of ​​taking a breath: "In the eight years since liberation, one movement followed another, and we are so tired that we are a little out of breath. When can we be quiet?" We did not realize that the series of movements after liberation all have their inherent connections. This is not subjectively fabricated by people, but is prepared by the historical development of our country. The past five major movements, either the complete completion of the democratic revolution or the component parts of the socialist revolution; the three major transformations were carried out on the basis of the five major movements, and the three major transformations themselves were also carried out in a prepared and step-by-step manner. They are carried out in mutual contact and coordination. The current anti-rightist struggle is a continuation of the socialist revolution on the political front and the ideological front. "The tree wants to be quiet but the wind does not stop." What is the wind? The wind is the contradiction. Where there is contradiction, there is struggle. The task of the people is to reflect and resolve the contradictions as correctly as possible and promote the development of the struggle. The existence of contradictions is absolute. If it is said that there are no contradictions, then there are no struggles and movements, and the whole world is a monolithic whole, which means that the world and mankind will be destroyed and should be replaced by something else. And this is completely impossible. People should understand: If people can face the contradictions squarely, meet the struggles, and help the development of the struggles and the resolution of the contradictions, then people can promote the advancement of history, always be in an active position, and strive for tranquility. In this sense, tranquility and struggle can be unified. On the contrary, if people stay away from reality and take an avoidance attitude towards contradictions, then they will never get tranquility. "Piercing the Western Mirror," in fact, Fei Xiaotong does not require tranquility, because his hands are stretched very long. Even if there is "a room, two books," he is also "thinking that the swan will arrive soon" and "his soul is not guarding his home."

　　Our socialist revolution takes the method of peaceful transformation. For the past eight years, we have basically been in a peaceful environment, which is a great happiness for our country and people. But precisely because of this, the shock of class struggle received by our intellectuals is not profound. The ancients said: "Born in sorrow, die in happiness." If we use new content to interpret these words, we can learn something from it, that is: people should be at the top of a sharp struggle in order to obtain infinite ideological power and life power; greedy for the tranquility inside the snail shell, not seeing the world, can not stand the wind and rain.

　　Trust and Doubt

　　Fei Xiaotong observed the relationship between the Party and intellectuals wearing sunglasses. He said that Premier Zhou's "Report on the Issue of Intellectuals" only "played the role of awakening the蛰 like spring thunder," and "then the gentle breeze of the 百家争鸣 blew, and the positive factors of intellectuals" only "moved accordingly." Fei Xiaotong tried his best to belittle the Party's specific deployment of "marching towards science," the ideological movement to criticize bourgeois idealism, the teaching reform to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and the ideological remolding movement carried out in intellectual circles. His purpose is to shake the intellectuals' trust in the Party, increase their doubts about the Party, and ask them not to be of one mind with the Party, but to be of two minds.

　　Does the Party trust intellectuals or doubt intellectuals? This is not something that Fei Xiaotong and his ilk can arbitrarily say by stirring up their tongues. This is evidenced by historical and current facts.

　　The Party's trust and support for intellectuals has been consistent. Of course, there are also some shortcomings and problems in it, such as the shortcomings and problems of sectarianism and sectarianism, as well as the shortcomings and problems of paralysis and accommodation. The former tendency leads to doubt, and the latter tendency leads to blind and indiscriminate trust. Both of these tendencies must be overcome, and in fact the Party is overcoming them. Trust is two-way. As one party of intellectuals, it is natural to ask the Party to trust themselves more fully. This cannot be said to be wrong, but the more important thing is to ask oneself first and see if one has any real facts in each revolutionary historical period to show whether one can win the Party's trust. In decades of cruel revolutionary struggle, the working class knows, the Communist Party knows: what different attitudes different people have taken, who should be trusted the most, and who should be trusted the least. Therefore, we intellectuals who have come from the old era must humbly sum up our history of political struggle, and see what attitude we have taken towards the Party, the revolution, and the people in the past, and what attitude we are showing now. The scales are accurate. It is too presumptuous to ask for more weight on one end of the scales without strictly demanding of oneself, but reaching out to the Party for more trust.

　　In the previous period, people talked a lot about the "wall" and "ditch." It is not known where this came from. In my opinion, there is no ditch or wall between the Party and non-Party members, but there is a line. This is a class line, a line between two ideological systems. This line should not and cannot be blurred. If it is said that there is a ditch or a wall between the Communist Party and non-Party members, it is tantamount to saying that the Communist Party, which "starts from the fact that our country has 600 million people in making plans, handling affairs, and thinking about problems," has become a party that is divorced from the masses. Everyone knows that this is not in line with the facts. Sectarianism exists, and this is one of the important contents of the Communist Party's rectification. This is the legacy of the old era, and the Communist Party will never miss this legacy.

　　Fei Xiaotong and others with thieving eyes naturally look at the Party with suspicious eyes when they are doing reactionary things, saying that the Party does not trust themselves. Our broad masses of upright intellectuals trust the Party, and the Party trusts us. We believe that the policy of unity, education, and transformation itself is the Party's unparalleled trust and deep love for intellectuals. After the great anti-rightist struggle, we believe that the divisive poison sold by Fei Xiaotong and his ilk will not have any market.

　　Climate and Constitution

　　Fei Xiaotong compared himself to a "surviving citizen of a prosperous age," with his mind full of "twilight thoughts," but he wanted to infect the intellectuals in the new era with this end-of-the-century decadent mood. His article "used his mind on the issue of temperature." He tried his best to "blow cold wind" and make people "feel the chill." He said that intellectuals "have a sense of loneliness: when a person encounters a favorite thing (he is referring to socialism here) but feels that he has no part in it, the kind of helplessness arises in his heart." In the "chilling" weather, he also talked about the health of intellectuals' "constitution" and "grass and trees themselves." What he meant was that intellectuals (the grass and trees themselves) are certainly not very "healthy," but the "main" thing is that the "climate is not good," so they cannot bloom and bear fruit. Here, he is really "firing on both sides": on the one hand, he lightly put the transformation of the grass and trees themselves in a very secondary position, and on the other hand, he wrote all the "sins" of the intellectual's "old tree" not sprouting "new branches" on the Party's account.

　　To discuss the issue of "climate," we now need to return to the issue of stand. Different stands have different feelings of warmth and cold in the political climate. This is an objective fact. In the eyes of socialists, the current weather is indeed a beautiful sunny day in a good spring. The broadest masses of the people in the country have never been so full of bright hope and the joy of life as in the era led by the Communist Party. Many intellectuals cannot but be increasingly strongly influenced by the great cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction in our country, and see the interconnected destiny of the entire nation and themselves from the new life of China. So why are some intellectuals not so accustomed to the new society, feel uncomfortable all over, and do not feel as warm as workers and peasants? I think we should indeed look for answers from our own "constitution." I think that those who have not completely transformed their general stand and whose bourgeois individualistic thoughts still occupy their souls will feel that the "climate" is not very good, and that the "atmosphere seems humid and under pressure." Regarding the temperament of this kind of bourgeois individualist and their feelings about the surrounding things, Gorky has a very vivid and accurate description in "The Destruction of Personality":

　　"The basic mood of the modern individualist is this kind of unease that cannot be lived to the end: he is at a loss, and has exhausted his energy, and must find some way to grasp life, but he has no strength, only a little so-called 'fool's cleverness' cunning. His heart is already decadent and exhausted, fragmented, so he is sometimes attentive to socialism and sometimes flatteringly flattering capitalism, but this premonition of impending social annihilation is increasingly and rapidly destroying the small, hunchbacked 'I.' ... The result of the individual's spiritual and physical degeneration is clear evidence of the individual's extreme decadence." The "extreme decadence" of the individual shows the poverty of the individual's spiritual life, and also shows the weakness and dryness of ideological strength, so he loses the enthusiasm to pursue a new life and beautiful ideals. This situation does exist to varying degrees and faintly in our group of old intellectuals. Therefore, we must carry out a transformation in thought and emotion, and resolutely bid farewell to this negative and unhealthy thought and emotion. Only in this way can we know how to place ourselves in the new society and serve the people with a happy mood.

　　"The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of the Long March, and ten thousand waters and thousands of mountains are nothing to them. ... Even more delighted with the thousand miles of snow in Minshan, the three armies are all smiles after passing." In such difficult years of battle, our leader Chairman Mao encouraged the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire people with a high degree of revolutionary optimism to fight arduously and achieve victory in the revolutionary cause. We intellectuals should arm ourselves with such revolutionary optimism. Let Fei Xiaotong and others hide in dark corners and tremble and have malaria! Under the Party's care, our hearts are always warm.

　　What Kind of Ferry to Take?

　　Fei Xiaotong misses the past. His reactionary class stand determines that he can only look back all the time; he lit intoxicating bewitching incense for intellectuals, wanting to drag them back with him.

　　All exploiting classes, whether slave owners, the landlord class, or the bourgeoisie, as long as they have gained a firm foothold in the position of rulers, they will certainly affirm that the existence of things in the world is fundamentally unchangeable, and that the order of the current system is eternal—even if it has had some positive actions in the ascending stage. It can be said that negative, conservative, and backward thinking has been inextricably linked with the exploiting classes from the very beginning. In order to protect its vested interests and position and fearing the resistance of the exploited classes, it naturally needs this kind of ideological theory to serve it. Looking back, retreating, not daring, unwilling, and unable to look forward and move forward is the class characteristic of all exploiters.

　　The working class is the opposite. It is the most advanced class in human history, the most able to accept the truth, and the most able to see new things. It is a class that is determined to innovate. It is always full of vitality and does not stay at a fixed stage. It is not afraid of any difficulties, and it has enough strength to overcome any difficulties. It firmly believes that the world is created by labor, that mankind can transform the objective world, and that it can transform its own subjective world in the process of transforming the objective world. The working class firmly believes that the revolutionary cause it leads can be victorious; and that after the victory of the revolution, it has the ability to catch up with the scientific and technological level that capitalism needs one, one and a half, or two centuries to reach in a few decades. The working class loves new things. Even if the seedlings of new things have just appeared on the horizon, it can discover them with its keen eyes, cultivate them with its revolutionary enthusiasm, and promote their growth, development, and growth. Therefore, the working class always looks forward and moves forward. The working class also looks back and reviews history, but this is to summarize the main experiences in the work, including the successful experiences and the wrong experiences, so that those beneficial experiences can be promoted, and lessons can be learned from those wrong experiences.

　　Our country is a socialist country led by the working class. In the process of building socialism, the original members of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie will eventually be transformed into workers and collective farmers (including their intellectuals). This is the only direction forward. The old intellectuals can only entrust their destiny to the working class and follow this direction forward in order to have a future. In order to never lose direction, the old intellectuals must transform themselves to adapt to the progress of society, and should not imagine making the social system adapt to themselves. It should be seen that transforming one's own old stand, old views, and old thinking style is a glorious thing, and as long as one does not miss the past, one should not have any inferiority complex.

　　Ma Zhemin, a core member of the Luo Longji Group, said: "The alliance (should be read as the Zhang-Luo Alliance) is the only ferry for intellectuals to transition to socialism." Be careful, this is a "thief ship." When the ship reaches the heart of the river, the white waves are turbulent, and the passengers are in danger of being pushed into the water and buried in the belly of the fish; otherwise, this ship will transition to the Taiwan Strait and to the other side of the Pacific. We intellectuals should not listen to the sweet words of the pirates on the "thief ship," but listen to the words of the Communist Party and resolutely believe in and accept the leadership of the Communist Party. This is the real "慈航普渡," which can guarantee a harmless transition to socialist society.

　　Sincerely and earnestly, rather than half-heartedly, transforming one's own thinking, transforming the stand, resolutely abandoning the ideological impurities brought from the old society and the old class, and determined to be a strong fighter of the working class who is completely transparent—this should be our intellectuals' grand ambition, our final destination, and what the historical situation requires of us.

　　坐什么渡船？
　　杨东莼
    1947年，在旧“观察”二卷十期上，为了纪念五四青年节，费孝通以“没有安排好的道路”为题，发表了他致他的“安平兄”的信。信称：“我很怕将来检讨中国这半个世纪历史的人会谴责我们，现在在四十左右这一代，我们只会走已安排好的路，而没有为下一代安排新路。”他写这封信的时候，正是中国人民解放军处于大反攻的前夕，他心情颤栗地发现自己走的路，跟当时广大青年不一样。他看到青年们“幼稚、过激、着迷、入魔”，不及他“老成、持重、超脱、淡泊”。他的阶级本能使他脱离了青年，脱离了人民，脱离了时代，他不能不感到寂寞。他想诱惑青年们走他所设计的道路——脱离革命的“新路”，青年们不听他的话，他就像幽灵似的更加感到惶恐了。
    十年后，1957年3月和5月，费孝通又先后发表了“知识分子的早春天气”和“早春前后”两篇文章，他用妖艳的词藻，以迂回的章法，倾泻了自己对共产党和新社会的仇恨，发泄了自己个人主义的颓废情绪。他感到在我们的国家里没有春天，气候对他的体质是如此不相宜，于是以知识分子的“救世主”自居，甜言蜜语地引诱、挑唆、煽动、蛊惑知识分子走脱离党、脱离社会主义的道路。广大知识分子不听他的话，这回，他不但寂寞了，而且在广大革命知识界和人民群众的猛击下，变成了人人喊打的过街老鼠。时间是多么无情啊！十年前，费孝通像做了小偷似的害怕着的“谴责”，十年后终于来到了。历史是最公正的裁判者，它在裁判着费孝通这一伙知识界的败类。
    工人阶级立场和资产阶级立场
    费孝通在他那棵毒草里，他向知识分子灌迷汤，从根本上反对知识分子的思想改造，即反对知识分子应当从本质上转变自己的阶级立场。谁都知道，立场问题对知识分子的思想改造来说，是个根本性的问题。知识分子本身不是一个阶级，它只是附着在某一阶级的“皮”上、并为此阶级服务的一个特定的社会阶层。一般来讲，知识分子为那一个阶级服务，他就必须站在那个阶级的立场上，保卫那个阶级的利益。中国旧知识分子，从总的方面来考察，出身于资产阶级和地主阶级，长期受资产阶级的教育，长期为资产阶级服务，因此，称他们为资产阶级知识分子，说他们站在资产阶级立场，是科学的合乎实际情况的。但是，在中国的具体历史条件下，由于中国民族资产阶级在一定时期和一定程度上能够参加或者同情新民主主义革命，也就是说，在民主革命期间，站在资产阶级立场，中国民族资产阶级还可以参加这个革命或者保持中立；因而，为资产阶级服务、站在资产阶级立场上的知识分子，还是能够投身于革命的队伍，为民主革命作出一定的贡献。绝大多数旧知识分子能在人民大革命风暴中并不十分勉强地迎新送旧，其理由就在这里。然而，革命在向前发展。在现时的中国，变革生产资料所有制的社会主义革命已经取得决定性的胜利，社会主义制度已经建立，因此，资产阶级的立场、资本主义的生产资料所有制，就丧失了它在一定历史条件下的革命性，变成了反动的东西。在这样的情况下，替资产阶级服务的旧知识分子，失去了原先的物质基础和阶级凭借，就应当而且必须附着在另一个阶级的“皮”上，为另一个阶级服务，站到另一个阶级的立场上面来。这个阶级就是新兴的、富有生命力的工人阶级。这个道理，虽然许多知识分子能够接受，主观上也的确在追求进步，但在客观实践上却不那样坚决。少数人决心很大，迈了大步，完成了或基本上完成了立场上的根本转变；绝大多数人是在两个立场之间摇来摆去，但基本上仍是资产阶级立场，或者说资产阶级立场占优势；一小部分人死死抱住资产阶级立场不放，在历史的洪流中掉了队，堕落成为今天的资产阶级右派分子。
    当中国共产党开展整风运动的时候，知识界的许多人对形形色色的意见的确感到有些迷惘恍惚。他们没有法子分辨是非，思想上陷于一种混乱状态。反右派斗争展开以后，他们又缩手缩脚，犹豫踟蹰，莫知所措。这种情况说明，知识界的广大中间层的人们，距完成政治立场上的根本转变还差得很远很远，这自然也就说明知识界的思想改造，并不如费孝通所言，立场问题已经解决；恰恰相反，它告诉我们，知识分子当前改造思想的严重问题仍然是一个尖锐的立场问题。
    我们大家有一个共同的感觉，反右派斗争，对于我们知识分子来说，的确是一次最严格的考试。党根据“群众的革命觉悟应该在斗争的风雨里培养而不应该在温室里培养”的原则来考试我们，我们就应当怀着对严师的感激心情、而不应当有所怨艾。考得好，不必骄矜，应该奋发努力；考得不好，甚或交了白卷，立场上发生了问题，是一次严重的教训，心情当然感到沉重，但也没有理由灰心丧气。一时思想上陷入混乱，滑到或全部滚到资产阶级立场方面去，经过一番斗争，回到真理和正确的立场方面来，“吃一堑，长一智”，这应当理解为一件好事情。这对我们来说，是感受过一次“切肤之痛”，使我们能更严格的要求自己，加强思想改造，尽快地转变自己的立场。
    一滴水主义和一本书主义
    费孝通的文章，浸染着资产阶级的极端个人主义情绪，这跟丁玲的“一本书主义”在本质上是相同的。丁玲认为，“一个人只要写出一本书来，就谁也打不倒”，“工作再多也没有意思，只有写出书来才是自己的”。丁玲把“一本书”当作个人登上皇家宝座的资本，这本书的影响愈大，她就认为她的资本愈雄厚，这种彻头彻尾自私自利的个人主义，和我们所要求的集体主义是水火不相容的。
    个人主义是对集体主义而言的。从社会经济基础来讲，个人主义是私有财产制度的产物。个人从集体里面分裂出来的过程，正是原始共产主义社会解体，步入奴隶社会、封建社会、资本主义社会的过程，而当社会进入社会主义的时代，个人主义就不能不奏起悼亡之曲，敲响起送葬的挽钟。
    个人主义者否定集体和群众的力量，在个人主义者看来，世界是英雄创造的，“群氓”只能起摇旗呐喊的作用，集体是为个人服务的，集体是为了个人的存在而存在的。一切严重的、疯狂的个人主义者，都是历史唯心主义者，他们心目中只有一个“自我”，失去了“自我”，一切国家、社会和民族都失去了实际意义。
    知识分子的独特的工作条件，形成了知识分子的独特的心理状态，其本质的要素就是个人主义。一本书写出来了，他认为是他一个人的功劳；一个发明和创造证明成功了，他也认为是他一个人的功劳。他绝不会想到，正是人民的智慧和劳动，才给他思想上以丰富的养料，才给他的文学创作和科学试验以成功的保证。个人主义者既经跟群众隔离，既然否定群众对他的哺乳、抚育的恩惠，因此他就不会给劳动群众以同志般的、平等的待遇，他跟群众、跟集体，就经常处于一种对抗的状态。忘恩负义，正是个人主义的特色。
    “人不为己，天诛地灭”，是个人主义者的坚定信念。个人主义者以自我为中心，一心一念在一个“我”字上面。在我们的时代，这种绝顶疯狂的个人主义者在政治上就表现为极端恶劣的“顺我者昌、逆我者亡”的霸王；在待人接物、处理工作时就表现为“宁愿我负天下人、不愿天下人负我”的丧失理性的唯我主义者；在对党的关系上就表现为“我得意的时候站在党之上、失意的时候站在党之外”的市侩。这种思想愈发展，“我”字扩展得愈大，相形之下，群众和党就显得愈渺小。如果党要干涉他，群众要批评他，组织要监督他，他就要反干涉，反批评，反监督，最终，他就必然坠入反党、反人民的脏臭的泥坑而不能自拔。所以说，个人主义者最终毁灭了个人！
    个人主义者喜欢和人家比。但他们从来不愿和人家比对革命的贡献，比政治思想上的进步，而是斤斤计较于物质、名誉和地位。“你当了代表，我呢？”“你出入汽车，我呢？”“你是一级教授，我呢？”这种“你……，我呢？”的公式，使个人主义者陷入于一种十分庸俗的患得患失的可怜状态。既然这种个人主义者要以自我为中心，要六亿人民迁就他一个人，他就会觉得：左不是，右也不是；前不是，后也不是；正面不是，反面也不是；不及时发给他稿费当然不是，预支稿费给他，他又说你用“糖衣炮弹”来“封”他的“嘴”，当然也不是。总之，这样的个人主义者，手伸得很长，要满足自己的永无止境的私欲，私欲不遂，他就会不满，小不满发展为大不满，他就把一腔“怨气”通通倾泻到党和人民的头上。这样的个人主义者，如果不反党、反人民、反社会主义，这才是天大的怪事！
    在知识分子当中，有这么一种人，他们特别留恋自己的影子。他们说，“人到中年，总喜欢细细审视自己经历的人生道路的脚痕，此生余日无多，悠悠岁月，毫无声息，心有未甘，总想留下点什么似的。”这种论调，在实质上跟“一本书主义”是差不多的。需要说明，我们并不反对知识分子的事业进取心，我们欢迎知识分子著书立说，在各方面有所发明和创造。但我们要看，这种事业进取心究竟是建筑在一种什么基础上面。如果是从资产阶级的名位观念出发，我们就认为这是一种可耻的个人主义的行径，是完全不足取法的。
    个人主义是资产阶级自私自利思想的产物，工人阶级大公无私的思想，只会产生集体主义。个人主义者的一切从个人出发，同时希望一切回归个人；集体主义者的一切从集体出发，最终回归集体。但是，在伟大的集体中，个人的劳动、智慧、发明和创造，还是会得到全社会的公平估价，他的劳动价值仍然会得到人民的批准，因此，他个人就能享到最崇高的、集体的、全社会认可的荣誉。从工人阶级的立场看来，集体并不扼杀个人的劳动和才能，但是，离开了党和集体，任何个人都只能是一块废料。把个人的事业溶化于集体事业之中，鲁迅先生是一个伟大的榜样。鲁迅先生说：“巨大的建筑，总是一木一石叠起来的，我们何妨做这一木一石呢？我时常做些零碎事，就是为此。”释迦牟尼佛说：“如果要使一滴水永远不干，就要放在大海里去。”这是一句充满深刻智慧的话，我们应当从这句话里学习一点东西：如果我们想永不干涸，就要实行一滴水主义，唾弃一本书主义。
    谦逊和骄傲
    费孝通说，“知识分子最关心的是他们的知识如何被人估价，是否被人赏识和尊重，这对知识分子说来，是比什么都重要的问题。”费孝通一再强调要有“真才实学”才吃得开，似乎只有他才最有学问，党和工农群众、老干部不独是“不学无术”，而且对他的学问估计和重视不足。费孝通的骄矜自恃的神色跃然纸上，他想以此来鼓励知识分子的盲目的自大狂，向党翘尾巴。
    自私自利和自高自大，是资产阶级知识分子一对孪生的痼疾。我们知识分子之所以容易犯骄傲自满、狂妄自大的毛病，是由于我们终日为小天地所局限，见闻不广；是由于我们思想方法的片面性，不认识客观实际，不从客观实际出发；是由于我们脱离群众，不肯向群众学习；是由于我们容易满足现状，有一点点成就便沾沾自喜。有时候，“山中无老虎，猕猴称大王”，个人英雄主义表现得特别浓厚。有时候，碰上了比我们强的对手，又会说“英雄所见略同”，流露出一副十足的阿Q相。有时候，在新事物、新形势面前，自己实在感到不行，但又死要面子，害怕有损自己的威信，就把自己之所以不行往客观原因上推。所有这些，都是骄傲自满、狂妄自大的表现。
    我们承认，在我们知识分子的队伍中，的确有些人是业有专精、学有专长的。所谓高级知识分子，就某一专门的业务来讲是高级的，也只是在这个意义上，才能称为“专家”。但是，从整个社会政治来看，从前人的劳动成果来看，从全部阶级斗争知识和生产斗争知识的浩瀚海洋来看，高级知识分子不但是不够高深渊博，恰恰相反，越是高级知识分子，他的知识面也就越窄。鲁迅先生说，“专门家之言多悖”。所谓“多悖”，正是“隔行如隔山”产生的后果。某一行的专家，在本行之外表现为无知，悖于事理，这种情况是并不鲜见的。因此，党和人民尊重我们的专行专业，而如果我们自以为了不起的话，那就证明了我们自己的狂妄和浅薄；如果竟认为这是自己的“撒手锏”，以此来向党翘尾巴的话，那就是一种不可饶恕的罪过了。
    工人阶级跟我们知识分子不同，他们质朴无华，从来不骄傲自满。他们认为作出了成绩是应该的，值不得骄傲，而只有严格要求自己，做出更多更大的成绩来。因此，工人阶级永远不满足于现状，永远向前迈进。为什么工人阶级能够这样做？这是因为工人阶级没有个人打算和个人情绪，而是时时以集体事业为念的。
    骄傲自满的知识分子，目中无人，目中无党，总是把个人和党的关系摆在不正常的位置上。其实，任何知识分子的任何成就，都是党的领导教育和群众抚养的结果。用自己微小的成就，作为向党骄傲的资本，这是一种忘本的恶行。越是有学问、有成就的知识分子，越是听党的话，越是谦虚谨慎。鲁迅先生是中国新文化革命运动的旗帜和主将，他的精湛造诣是众所公认的，但是，鲁迅从来就是虚怀若谷的。服从党的决定，这就是鲁迅认为应该遵守的组织纪律。鲁迅公开承认自己的作品是“遵命文学”，遵谁之命？遵无产阶级之命，遵党之命。我们这些犯有程度不同的骄傲自满毛病的知识分子，如果把鲁迅作为一面镜子来检验一下自己，是会羞愧得无地自容的。
    “一间房、二本书”和斗争的风雨
    费孝通说，现在知识分子提出了“新的要求”，据说他的“许多朋友们的心愿”是：“‘一间房、二本书’，意思是要能静静地做做功课”。费孝通说：“我看安静一下，把紧张的空气缓和一些，多读读书，才是壅土施肥的工作。为了开花结果，不做做这些基本建设是不成的。”费孝通说这就是知识分子要求提高业务的积极性。
    其实，费孝通倒不是真正关心知识分子提高业务的要求，他是在引诱知识分子脱离政治，不要改造思想，这样他就有可能牵着那些书生气十足的知识分子的鼻子走。对于这一点，他表演了一出“此地无银三百两”的丑剧，他作贼心虚地说：“一间房、二本书”和“两耳不闻天下事”有什么必然的联系呢？房里不一定没有报纸和收音机，书本上讲的又为什么不能是天下事呢？接着，他以极端狂妄的挑战性的语气说：“‘静静地’一语是不是又惹起了反感？是不是一静就不能成为积极分子了？”他在尽情诬蔑我们的政治生活之后，说出了他的最后结论：知识分子只有通过“实践”才能改造思想，而“实践就是业务”，“通过业务来改造，通过业务来服务，其中无处没有政治”。因而“一间房、二本书”本身就有政治。这就是费孝通为了取消思想改造所发出来的荒谬论点！我们从来也不曾否认，一个基本上解决了立场问题的知识分子，可以通过业务实践来认识和掌握马克思主义；但是，我们也认为，业务毕竟不等于政治，业务是为一定的经济基础、一定的政治目的服务的。当许多知识分子分明还没有很好地解决立场问题的时候，费孝通大弹“业务等于政治”的催眠曲，这是别有用心的。这支催眠曲是有来历的，它的老祖宗就是胡风的“哪里有生活，哪里就有斗争”。
    “一间房、二本书”的口号带有一定的煽惑性，它投合了我们某些知识分子的胃口。这是因为旧知识分子习惯于孤芳自赏的单干式的生活，习惯于明窗净几、悠哉游哉的生活，而不习惯于紧张的战斗生活。我们知识分子时时有一种喘一口气的思想：“解放八年来，一个运动紧接着一个运动，累得有些气喘，什么时候能够宁静宁静呢？”我们没有认识到，解放后一系列的运动，都有着它们的内在联系性，这不是人们主观臆造出来的，它是我国历史发展所准备好了的。过去的五大运动，或者是民主革命的彻底完成，或者是社会主义革命的组成部分；三大改造是在五大运动的基础上进行的，三大改造本身也是有准备有步骤地进行的，它们是相互联系配合起来进行的。现在进行的反右派斗争，又是社会主义革命在政治战线上和思想战线上的继续。“树欲静而风不止”，风是什么？风就是矛盾。有矛盾就有斗争。人们的任务，就是尽可能正确地反映矛盾和解决矛盾，推动斗争的发展。矛盾的存在是绝对的。如果说矛盾没有了，那么，斗争和运动也没有了，全世界是铁板一块，这就意味着世界和人类将要毁灭，应当由别的东西来代替。而这又是完全不可能的。人们应该明白：如果人们能正视矛盾，迎接斗争，帮助斗争的发展和矛盾的解决，那么，人们就能推动历史前进，就永远处于主动地位，就能争取到宁静。在这个意义上讲，宁静和斗争是可以统一起来的。相反，人们如果远离现实，对矛盾采取规避态度，那么，他们就始终得不到宁静。“戳穿西洋镜”，其实，费孝通并不要求宁静，理由是他的手伸得很长，即使有“一间房、二本书”，他也是“一心以为鸿鹄将至”“魂不守舍”的。
    我们的社会主义革命是采取和平改造的办法，八年来，我们又基本上处于和平的环境当中，这对于我们的国家和人民，是一个大幸福。但也正因为如此，我们知识分子受到的阶级斗争的激荡就显得不深刻。古人说：“生于忧患，死于安乐。”如果我们用新的内容来阐释这些话，我们就可以从中获得一些教益，这就是：人们应当处于尖锐的斗争的顶端，才能取得无穷的思想力量和生命力量；贪图蜗牛壳里边的宁静，不见世面，是经不起风吹雨打的。
    信任和怀疑
    费孝通戴着墨镜，观察党和知识分子的关系。他说，周总理作了“关于知识分子问题的报告”，才“像春雷般起了惊蛰作用”，“接着百家争鸣的和风一吹，知识分子的积极因素”才“应时而动了起来”。费孝通极力诋毁党所领导的“向科学进军”的具体部署、批判资产阶级唯心主义的思想运动、学习苏联先进经验的教学改革、在知识界中展开的思想改造运动，他的目的在于：动摇知识分子对党的信任，增加他们对党的怀疑，要他们别和党一条心，要二意三心。
    党到底是信任知识分子，还是怀疑知识分子？这不是费孝通之流鼓起如簧之舌可以任意胡说的，这是有历史的和当前的事实为证的。
    党对知识分子的信任和支持是一贯的。当然，这里面也有一些缺点和毛病，有关门主义、宗派主义的缺点和毛病，同时也有麻痹迁就的缺点和毛病。前一种倾向导向怀疑，后一种倾向导向盲目地不加区别地信任。这两种倾向都是必须克服的，事实上党也正在克服。信任是双方面的，知识分子作为一方面，要求党对自己更充分地信任，这自然不能说有什么不对，但更主要的则是必须反求诸己，首先看看自己在各个革命历史时期，是否有真正的事实表现，是否能够取得党的信任。在几十年的残酷的革命斗争中，工人阶级知道，共产党知道：各种不同的人们采取了怎样不同的态度，哪些人应该受到最多的信任，哪些人应该受到最少的信任。因此，我们从旧时代过来的知识分子，必须虚心地总结一下自己的政治斗争历史，看一看自己对党、对革命、对人民，过去究竟采取的是什么态度，现在究竟表现的是什么态度。天平是分毫不爽的，在天平的一头要求多加一些法码，自己又不严格地要求自己，却伸手向党要更多的信任，这就太不自量了。
    前一个时期，人们大谈大论了一阵“墙”“沟”之说，这话究何所自起，不得而知。据我看，党与非党之间，沟、墙实无，线却是有一条的。这是一条阶级界线，是两种思想体系之间的界线，不应该、也不可能模糊这条界线。如果说，共产党和非党之间有一条沟，或是有一堵墙，这无异说，“作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发”的共产党，倒是成了一个脱离群众的政党了。谁都知道，这是与事实不符的。宗派主义是有的，而这正是共产党整风的重要内容之一。这是旧时代的遗产，共产党决不留恋这份遗产。
    贼心鬼眼的费孝通者流，他们干着反动勾当，自然用怀疑的眼光来看党，说党不信任自己。我们广大的正直的知识分子信任党，党也信任我们。我们认为，团结、教育、改造的政策本身，就是党对知识分子的无比的信任和深情的爱护。经过伟大的反右派斗争之后，我们相信，费孝通者流所兜售的挑拨离间的毒药是不会有任何市场的。
    气候和体质
    费孝通以“盛世遗民”自况，满脑子“黄昏迟暮思想”，但他想把这种世纪末颓废情绪感染身处新时代的知识分子。他的文章“在温度问题上是用过心思的”，他尽量地在“吹冷风”，让人们“感到寒意”。他说知识分子“有一种寂寞之感：当一个人碰到一桩心爱的事（他在这里指的是社会主义）而自己却又觉得没有份的时候，心里油然而生的那种无可奈何的意味。”他在“寒意逼人”的天气里也谈到知识分子的“体质”和“草木本身”的健康问题，他的意思是，知识分子（草木本身）当然不很“健旺”，但“主要的”是“气候不好”，所以开不出花，结不出果。在这里，他可真是“两面开弓”：一面轻悄悄地把草木本身的改造放到了十分次要的地位，另一面则把知识分子这棵“老树”茁不出“新枝”的“罪过”通通写到党的账上。
    要讨论“气候”的问题，我们现在又有必要回到立场问题上来。立场不同，政治气候的寒暖之感也不同，这是客观事实。在社会主义者看来，目前的天气确确实实是一个大好春光的艳阳天。全国最广大的人民，从来没有像在共产党领导的时代这样充满光明的希望和生的乐趣。许多知识分子在我国伟大的社会主义改造和社会主义建设的事业面前，不能不日益受到强烈的影响，并且从中国的新生中看到全民族和他们自己的互相关连的命运。那么，为什么有些知识分子对新社会不那么习惯，觉得浑身不自在，不像工人、农民那么觉得暖气洋洋呢？我认为，这倒的确要从自己的“体质”中去寻找答案。我认为，大体立场没有彻底转变过来、资产阶级个人主义思想仍然盘踞着自己的灵魂的人，他就会觉得“气候”不太好，似乎“大气显得潮湿和具有压力”。关于这种资产阶级个人主义者的气质和他们对周围事物的感应，高尔基在“个性的毁灭”中有着十分形象而精确的描写：
    “现代个人主义者的基本心情就是这种惶惶不可终日的苦闷：他茫然若有所失，竭尽了自己的精力，总得用甚么方法抓住生活，可是力量他是没有的，有的仅是一点所谓‘愚人的聪明’的狡猾。内心里已经是陈腐疲惫、支离破碎了，他就时而对社会主义殷勤献媚，时而对资本主义阿谀奉承，然而这濒临的社会复灭的预感却日益迅速地摧毁着渺小的佝偻的‘我’。……个人底精神物理上的蜕化之结果，就是个人的极度颓废之明证。”个人的“极度颓废”，表明个人精神生活的贫乏，也表明思想力量的孱弱和干涸，因而也就丧失了追求新生活和美丽理想的热情。这种情况，在我们这一班辈的旧知识分子身上，的确是程度不同地、若隐若现地存在着的。因此，必须在思想感情上进行脱胎换骨的改造，坚决地和这种消极的、不健康的思想感情告别。只有这样，我们才能在新的社会里知所以自处，才能心情舒畅地为人民服务。
    “红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲。……更喜岷山千里雪，三军过后尽开颜。”在那样艰难的战斗岁月里，我们的领袖毛主席以高度的革命乐观主义精神鼓舞全党、全军、全体人民，坚苦卓绝地为革命事业奋斗，取得了革命事业的胜利。我们知识分子，正应以这样的革命乐观主义精神来武装自己。让费孝通他们躲在阴暗的角落里瑟瑟缩缩地发疟子去罢！在党的爱抚下，我们的心永远是热烘烘的。
    坐什么渡船？
    费孝通缅怀往昔，他的反动的阶级立场决定他始终只能往后看；他对知识分子点起了醉人的迷魂香，想拖着他们跟他一样向后退。
    一切剥削阶级，不论是奴隶主、地主阶级或是资产阶级，只要一旦站稳了统治者的地位，他们就肯定：世界事物的存在是根本不可改变的，现在制度的秩序是永恒的，——即使在上升阶段它曾有过一些带积极意义的行动。可以说，消极、保守、落后的思想，是一开始就跟剥削阶级结了不解之缘的。它为了要保护其既得利益和地位，害怕被剥削阶级的反抗，就自然而然地需要这种思想理论来为它服务。往后看，向后退，不敢、不愿也不能往前看，向前进，这就是一切剥削者的阶级特征。
    工人阶级与此相反。它是人类历史上最先进的、最能接受真理的、最能看到新鲜事物的阶级，它是一个锐意革新的阶级。它永远朝气蓬勃，不停留在一个固定的阶段上。它不害怕任何困难，它有足够的力量克服任何困难。它坚决相信：世界是劳动创造的，人类能够改造客观世界，并在改造客观世界的过程中，改造自己的主观世界。工人阶级坚决相信：自己领导的革命事业可以胜利；而在革命胜利之后，自己有本事用几十年的功夫赶过资本主义需要一个、一个半、两个世纪才能达到的科学技术水平。工人阶级爱护新鲜事物，即使是新鲜事物的嫩苗刚刚在地平线上出现，它也能以自己敏锐的眼光发现它，以自己的革命热情培养它，促使它成长、发展、壮大。因此，工人阶级始终是往前看，向前进的。工人阶级也往后看，也回顾历史，但这是为了把工作中的主要经验，包括成功的经验和错误的经验，加以总结，使那些有益的经验得到推广，而从那些错误的经验中取得教训。
    我们的国家是工人阶级领导的社会主义国家。在我们建设社会主义的过程中，原来的资产阶级和小资产阶级的成员，都将最后转化为工人和集体农民（包括他们的知识分子）。这是一个唯一的前进方向。旧知识分子只有将自己的命运寄托在工人阶级身上，遵循这个方向前进，才有前途。而要永远地不迷失方向，旧知识分子就要改造自己来适应于社会的进步，不应当设想使社会制度来适应于自己。应该看到，改造自己的旧立场、旧观点、旧思想作风，是一件光荣的事情，只要不留恋过去，就不应当有任何自卑的情绪。
    罗隆基集团的核心分子马哲民说：“盟（应读作章罗联盟）是知识分子过渡到社会主义的唯一的一只渡船。”当心点，这是一条“贼船”，船至江心，白浪滔滔，乘客们有被推入水中、葬身鱼腹的危险；再不，这条船就会向台湾海峡、向太平洋彼岸过渡。我们知识分子不要听“贼船”上海盗们的甜言蜜语，要听共产党的话，坚决相信并接受共产党的领导，这才是真正的“慈航普渡”，这才能保证毫无凶险地过渡到社会主义社会。
    诚心实意地、而不是三心二意地改造自己的思想，把立场转变过来，坚决地抛弃从旧社会、旧阶级中带来的思想意识上的杂质，立志做一个通体透明的工人阶级的坚强战士。——这应当是我们知识分子的宏志豪愿，是我们的最终归宿，也是历史形势对我们的要求。
