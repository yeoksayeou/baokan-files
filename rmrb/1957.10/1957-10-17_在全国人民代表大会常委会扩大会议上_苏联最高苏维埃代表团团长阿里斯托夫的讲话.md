Respected Comrade Liu Shaoqi! Dear Comrades and Friends!

First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, to express my deepest gratitude to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for its gracious invitation to visit your beautiful country. We, all members of the delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, feel very honored to have this opportunity to visit China and to further understand and become familiar with the life of the great, industrious, and talented Chinese people.

With excitement, we represent the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the entire Soviet people in extending our warm, fraternal greetings to you, and wish you new achievements in your lofty work of seeking welfare for those people who are selflessly striving for the construction of socialism and the consolidation of world peace.

Dear friends! Good traditions have been established among socialist countries for mutual visits of various delegations, national leaders, and social activists. These visits not only enhance mutual understanding but also further strengthen the unbreakable friendship between us.

The Soviet people once welcomed Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Zhu De, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and other leading comrades of the People's Republic of China to their homeland with great excitement. This year, delegations from the National People's Congress headed by Comrade Peng Zhen and the Chinese government headed by Comrade Zhou Enlai visited the Soviet Union.

In order to continue to develop this tradition of mutual visits, our delegation from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is here to visit China in order to establish closer working contacts with the National People's Congress and to further strengthen friendly ties with the Chinese people.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union pointed out in its declaration on February 9, 1955, that the parliaments of all countries have a great responsibility to maintain and consolidate peace. This is because legislative documents that decide on war and peace issues must be passed by parliaments. Therefore, the Supreme Soviet believes that establishing direct contacts between the parliaments of all countries, exchanging visits of parliamentary delegations, and speeches by parliamentarians from one country in the parliament of another country are in line with the wishes of the peoples of all countries to develop friendly relations and mutual cooperation.

The declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has received the support of many national parliaments around the world. We would like to take this opportunity to point out with satisfaction that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress was one of the first parliaments to support this declaration.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and its parliamentary groups, strictly following the spirit and purpose of the 1955 declaration, have taken a series of major practical measures to ease international tensions, stop the arms race, and ban the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, to strive for closer cooperation between countries and to strive for the normalization of international relations.

On the one hand, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union itself is the initiator of various parliamentary actions to defend peace on many international political issues, and at the same time, it has tried its best to support all measures taken by the parliaments of other countries in this regard. For example, at its meeting in July 1956, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union noted with complete satisfaction that the Soviet and Japanese peoples shared the same views on the issue of banning nuclear weapons and stopping nuclear weapons testing in the declaration issued by the Japanese Diet on the issue.

We know very clearly that the National People's Congress has taken many measures to safeguard peace on its own initiative. At the same time, the National People's Congress has more than once supported the various measures taken by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to maintain and consolidate peace. We, the representatives of the Supreme Soviet, express our sincere thanks to you for this.

Dear friends! All the Soviet people greet the achievements made by the People's Republic of China in all aspects of socialist construction with great pleasure.

We are very pleased to be able to see with our own eyes during our visit to China that hundreds of millions of Chinese people are building their new life based on socialist principles with high enthusiasm and fervor.

During our visit to your beautiful country, we visited many cities, enterprises, cooperatives, scientific institutions, and universities. We had extremely cordial and sincere conversations with the staff of local people's committees, workers, farmers, staff, and representatives of science and culture. During the thirteen days of our visits to various places, we traveled a long distance from Beijing to Guangzhou, from Guangzhou to Changchun, visited the huge industrial and cultural center of Shanghai and Anshan, the center of China's ferrous metallurgy, visited China's first automobile factory in Changchun, and visited many other outstanding cities and industrial constructions of your motherland. Everything we saw in China left us with a deep and unforgettable impression. Huge construction work is going on everywhere, and the prospect of building a strong, industrialized China is already in sight.

We were very excited to see the magnificent Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which officially opened to traffic yesterday. We are so excited and proud because this magnificent bridge is the creation of human wisdom, the great creation made by the Chinese working class and the talented Chinese engineering technicians with their almighty hands. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge also proves the Chinese government's continuous concern for its people. Only a truly people's government can solve such a huge task.

Dear comrades, we warmly congratulate you all on this great victory, because the completion of the bridge construction project particularly vividly marks what your free and brave people can do!

Comrades! In the past eight years, the People's Republic of China has also achieved significant achievements on the international stage. The number of countries that have established normal diplomatic and trade relations with the People's Republic of China is increasing year by year. All of this undeniably proves that the imperialists' attempt to politically and economically isolate China has suffered a shameful defeat. It is very clear to the whole world that now no international problem can be solved without China's participation. However, the American aggressive group, which is malicious about all the achievements of the People's China, is still unwilling to face the existence of the People's Republic of China and the fact that it possesses a huge international prestige. The United States not only does not recognize the People's Republic of China, but also takes hostile actions against the People's Republic of China. The American imperialists occupy Taiwan Island, an inseparable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China.

The Soviet Union has always supported the Chinese people's demand to return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland, and has always advocated that the People's Republic of China should occupy its legitimate position in the United Nations.

Dear comrades! The Soviet people are preparing to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The October Revolution realized the long-term aspirations of the working people of our country, it ended the phenomenon of human exploitation, and it eliminated social and national oppression. The October Revolution declared and realized the great ideals of socialism, democracy, peace, equality, and friendship for all ethnic groups in our country.

The October Revolution was not only a great turning point in the lives of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, but also had a huge impact on the entire course of world history. It opened a new era in human history - an era of the collapse of imperialism and the establishment of socialism. Under the influence of the October Revolution, the national liberation movement in colonies and dependent countries began to rise unprecedentedly, and the colonial system of imperialism began to disintegrate.

Soviet democracy is a great achievement of the October Revolution. The strength of Soviet democracy lies in the fact that it is built on the socialist economic system and the socialist ownership of the means of production. The profound significance of the true democracy of the Soviet system lies in the fact that our country's policy is based on the interests of the broad masses of working people.

The political form of Soviet socialist democracy is the Soviet of Working People's Representatives, which is the broadest organization of the Soviet people. All adult residents of the country participate in the election of the Soviet of Working People's Representatives. More than 1.5 million representatives are elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Soviets of the various union republics and autonomous republics, and the local Soviets. They are all workers from factories, collective farms, and state farms, people from science and culture, and staff from state organs and social organizations.

The strength of the Soviet system lies in the fact that all its activities are closely connected with the masses of working people and are always supported by the people. The broad masses of people participate in the daily work of the Soviet state organs through various forms.

The active participation of the people in the discussion and resolution of extremely important issues in the country's political, economic, and cultural life is a vivid example of the true democracy of the Soviet system. Not long ago, a national discussion was held in our country on the draft report "On Further Improving the Organization of Management of Industry and Construction" made by Comrade Khrushchev at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. During the discussion, a total of 514,000 meetings were held in various enterprises and construction sites, scientific groups and institutions, collective farms, machine tractor stations and state farms, Soviet military units, and schools, with more than 40 million working people participating in the meetings. At these meetings, 2.3 million people spoke on the issue of improving the leadership of industry and construction. 68,000 people submitted their suggestions, opinions, and supplements in various central and local newspapers. The reorganization of the management of industry and construction is a creative development of Lenin's principle of democratic centralism in economic management and has already produced beneficial results.

Under the socialist system, the people are conscious and active creators of new life. In this regard, it must be pointed out that the Soviet working people widely participate in the state management of the national economy. One of the most effective forms of participation in management is the production meetings and worker meetings held in various enterprises, where workers and staff criticize administrative work and propose suggestions for improving the work of the enterprise. In 1956 alone, more than 10 million suggestions made at production meetings were adopted. The implementation of these suggestions has had great economic effects.

The entire life of Soviet society is permeated with the principles of socialist democracy. Not only is the work of our state organs built on the principles of true democracy, but also the work of all social organizations of the working people - trade unions, the Communist Youth League, cooperatives, collective farms, cultural, scientific, and other organizations - is built on the principles of true democracy.

The fraternal friendship and cooperation between all ethnic groups in our country is a great achievement of Soviet democracy. In the Soviet Union, there are no longer the economically backward and politically disenfranchised ethnic regions that existed in the era of Tsarist Russia. Today, there are equal union republics, autonomous republics, autonomous regions, and national districts. They have developed industries and large-scale socialist collective agriculture. We have been able to establish fraternal friendship between all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union because the Communist Party and the Soviet government have consistently implemented Lenin's policy of complete equality for all nationalities.

Soviet democracy is a powerful weapon for communist construction and mass education. The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and all measures to further improve the work of the Soviets of Working People's Representatives, expand the powers of the various union republics, and strengthen the socialist legal system are all aimed at further consolidating Soviet socialist democracy.

The achievements of Soviet science and technology are undeniably recognized worldwide. On the eve of the glorious 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, Soviet science and technology have made brilliant achievements in conquering nature, creating the world's first artificial earth satellite and intercontinental ballistic missile. These outstanding achievements are not only a victory for Soviet science and the Soviet people, but also once again prove the great superiority of socialism over capitalism, and the superiority of the socialist social system over the capitalist social system. Not only our friends recognize this, but even our enemies in the imperialist camp have to admit it.

Dear friends!

All the achievements that the Soviet people have made in the cause of communist construction are due to the fact that the Communist Party is the leading and guiding force of Soviet society. Without the Communist Party, armed with Marxist-Leninist theory and uniting all the most advanced and outstanding elements in the working class and the people into its ranks, it would have been impossible for the working people of our country to seize and grasp political power, and it would have been impossible to build socialism and move towards the bright future of mankind - communism.

Comrades:

In order to establish unlimited rule in the Middle East, American imperialists are plotting conspiracies against Syria, a peace-loving country. Here we want to declare openly: The fate of Syria, a small country, has become a matter involving the fate of all peace-loving people in the world. And the crisis of a dangerous armed conflict against Syria will contain the danger of a new world war. Although our people have no economic or other interests in the countries of the Middle East, they are firmly and unanimously opposed to the plans for military intervention against Syria. The unity of the peace-loving people of the world will expose the criminal activities of the warmongers and shatter all the insidious conspiracies of the warmongers.

The Soviet government and the Communist Party attach great importance to making every effort to improve the material living standards and welfare of the Soviet people. We have taken some necessary measures to greatly increase the production of food, especially milk, meat, and oil, in recent years. We have formulated and are implementing a huge plan for housing construction, which will make it possible to fully meet the needs of our working people in housing in the next ten to twelve years.

Dear friends! The Soviet people have overcome many difficulties in the process of building socialism. The Soviet Union was once the only socialist country in the world. At that time, it could only rely on itself, on its own strength and funds.

The situation has changed fundamentally now. Now there is a powerful socialist camp, and the great People's Republic of China is advancing smoothly along the road of socialism. Under these conditions, it is natural for the Soviet people to be able to solve the task of communist construction more easily. No threat from the imperialists who fantasize about reversing the wheels of history can frighten the socialist camp.

The unity of socialist countries is the guarantee of our achievements in the common cause of building socialism and communism and consolidating world peace. The foundation of this unity is the eternal and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

Dear comrades and friends! The whole world sees that the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is unshakable. This friendship is unbreakable because it is based on the common interests of the two peoples, the unity of their thoughts and ultimate goals. The fraternal relations between our two peoples are built on the principles of complete equality, respect for territorial integrity, respect for sovereignty, mutual assistance, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. No force in the world can separate us.

Dear friends! In the years since national liberation and the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have accumulated rich experience in the work of state power organs and in economic and cultural construction. We, the representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, have studied this experience very carefully and believe that many experiences in your practice can be effectively applied to our country. Please allow me, on behalf of the delegation, to once again express our deep gratitude to you for giving us the opportunity to further understand the life of the Chinese people.

Dear comrades and friends! As I conclude my speech, I would like to assure you that the Soviet people will do everything possible to further consolidate and develop the friendship between us for the benefit of the people of our two countries and the people of all countries in the socialist camp.

Long live the great Chinese people!

Long live the National People's Congress, the plenipotentiary embodiment of the will of the Chinese people!

Long live the Communist Party of China and the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!

### 在全国人民代表大会常委会扩大会议上  苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长阿里斯托夫的讲话

专栏：

    在全国人民代表大会常委会扩大会议上
    苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长阿里斯托夫的讲话敬爱的刘少奇同志！亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    首先，请允许我代表苏联最高苏维埃向全国人民代表大会常务委员会盛情邀请我们访问你们美好的国家表示深深的感谢。我们，苏联最高苏维埃代表团全体成员，这次有机会来中国访问，能进一步了解和熟悉伟大的、勤劳而天才的中国人民的生活，感到很荣幸。
    我们以兴奋的心情代表苏联最高苏维埃和全体苏联人民向你们致以热烈的、兄弟的敬礼，祝你们在替那些为建设社会主义、为巩固世界和平而忘我奋斗的人民谋福利的崇高工作中获得新的成就。
    亲爱的朋友们！社会主义各国之间已经建立了各种代表团、国家领导人员和社会活动家互相访问的良好传统。这种访问不仅增强了互相了解，而且也进一步加强了我们之间牢不可破的友谊。
    苏联人民曾经以极其兴奋的心情在自己国土上欢迎了毛泽东同志、朱德同志、刘少奇同志、周恩来同志和中华人民共和国的其他领导同志。今年，又有以彭真同志为首的全国人民代表大会代表团和以周恩来同志为首的中国政府代表团访问了苏联。
    为了继续发展这种互相访问的传统，我们苏联最高苏维埃代表团前来中国访问，以便同全国人民代表大会建立更密切的事务上的往来和更进一步加强同中国人民的友谊联系。
    苏联最高苏维埃在1955年2月9日的宣言中指出，各国议会有着维护和巩固和平的伟大责任。因为决定战争和和平问题的立法文件是要由议会通过的。因此，最高苏维埃认为，各国议会建立直接联系、互派议会代表团访问、一国议会人士在他国议会发表演说，这是符合各国人民发展友好关系和互相合作的愿望的。
    苏联最高苏维埃宣言获得了全世界许多国家议会的支持。我们想趁此机会怀着满意的心情指出，全国人民代表大会常务委员会是首先支持这个宣言的议会之一。
    苏联最高苏维埃及其议员团，严格遵循着1955年宣言的精神和宗旨，采取了一系列重大的实际措施来和缓国际紧张局势，停止军备竞赛和禁止试验原子武器和氢武器，来争取各国之间有更紧密的合作和争取国际关系正常化。
    苏联最高苏维埃一方面自己在许多国际政治问题上是种种保卫和平的议会行动的发起人，同时它也尽力支持其他国家议会在这方面采取的一切措施。例如，苏联最高苏维埃在1956年7月的会议上完全满意地指出，在日本国会就禁止核武器和停止核武器试验问题所发表的宣言上，苏联人民和日本人民在这个问题上的见解是一致的。
    我们很清楚地知道，全国人民代表大会根据自己的倡议采取了不少保卫和平的措施。同时，全国人民代表大会不止一次地支持苏联最高苏维埃为维护和巩固和平所采取的各项措施。我们，最高苏维埃代表们，为此向你们表示热诚的谢意。
    亲爱的朋友们！全体苏联人民都怀着极其愉快的心情迎接中华人民共和国在社会主义建设各个方面所取得的成就。
    我们非常高兴的是，在中国访问能够亲眼看到几亿中国人民都以高度的积极性和热情在建立自己的、以社会主义原则为基础的新生活。
    在访问你们美好国家的期间，我们参观了许多城市、企业、合作社、科学机关和高等学校。我们同地方人民委员会的工作人员、工人、农民、职员，以及科学和文化界的代表进行了极其亲切和诚恳的谈话。在各地访问的十三天当中，我们从北京到广州、从广州到长春走了很长一段路程，参观了巨大的工业和文化中心上海和中国黑色冶金中心鞍山，参观了长春的中国第一个汽车工厂，还参观了其他许多出色的城市和你们祖国的工业建设。我们在中国所看到的一切，都给我们留下了深刻的、不能忘记的印象。到处都在进行巨大的建设工作，建立起强大的、工业化的中国的前景已经在望了。
    我们看到了宏伟的武汉长江大桥，感到十分兴奋，这座大桥从昨天起已经开始正式通车。我们所以兴奋，所以感到自豪，是因为这座宏伟的桥梁是人类智慧的创造，是中国工人阶级、天才的中国工程技术人员用自己的万能的双手所作的伟大创造。武汉长江大桥也证明了中国政府不断关怀自己的人民。只有真正人民的政府才能解决这样巨大的任务。
    亲爱的同志们，我们热烈祝贺你们大家这一伟大的胜利，因为大桥建设工程的完成特别鲜明地标志着你们自由而勇敢的人民能够作出何等的事情！
    同志们！八年以来，中华人民共和国在国际舞台上也获得了重大的成就。同中华人民共和国建立了正常的外交关系和贸易关系的国家，一年比一年增加。所有这一切无可争辩地证明，帝国主义者企图在政治上和经济上孤立中国的打算遭到了可耻的失败。全世界都非常清楚，现在任何一个国际问题，如果没有中国参加是不可能得到解决的。但是，对人民中国一切成就抱有恶意的美国侵略集团，直到现在不愿正视中华人民共和国的存在和它拥有巨大的国际威望这一事实。美国不仅不承认中华人民共和国，而且对中华人民共和国采取敌视的行动。美国帝国主义者占领着中华人民共和国领土不可分割的组成部分——台湾岛。
    苏联一贯支持中国人民使台湾回到祖国怀抱的要求，并始终主张中华人民共和国在联合国应占有自己的合法地位。
    亲爱的同志们！苏联人民正在准备庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年。十月革命实现了我国劳动人民的长期愿望，它结束了人剥削人的现象，它消灭了社会的和民族的压迫。十月革命宣布了并实现了我国各族人民对社会主义、民主、和平、平等和友谊的伟大理想。
    十月革命不仅是苏联各族人民生活中的伟大转折点，而且对世界历史的整个进程有着巨大的影响，它开辟了人类历史的新纪元——帝国主义崩溃，社会主义确立的纪元。在十月革命的影响之下，殖民地和附属国的民族解放运动开始空前地高涨，帝国主义的殖民体系开始解体。
    苏维埃民主是十月革命的伟大成果。苏维埃民主之所以有力，就在于它是建筑在社会主义的经济制度和生产资料的社会主义所有制的基础之上。苏维埃制度的真正民主的深刻意义就在于我国的政策是以广大劳动人民群众的利益为基础的。
    苏维埃社会主义民主的政治形式是劳动人民代表苏维埃，劳动人民代表苏维埃是苏联人民的最广泛的组织。全国的一切成年居民都参加选举劳动人民代表苏维埃。共选出苏联最高苏维埃、各加盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃和各地方苏维埃的代表一百五十多万人。他们都是工厂、集体农庄和国营农场的劳动者、科学和文化界人士、国家机关和社会团体的工作人员。
    苏维埃制度之所以有力就在于它的一切活动都是与劳动人民群众密切相联系的，是永远依靠人民的支持的。广大人民群众通过各种各样的形式来参加苏维埃国家机关的日常工作。
    人民群众积极参加讨论和解决国家的政治、经济和文化生活中的极其重大的问题，这就是苏维埃制度真正民主的鲜明例证。不久以前对于赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃会议上所作的“关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作”的报告提纲，在我国进行了全民性的讨论。在讨论过程中各企业和建筑工地、各科学团体和机关、各集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场、苏军各部队和各学校一共举行了五十一万四千多次会议，有四千多万劳动人民参加了会议。在这些会议上，有二百三十万人就改进工业和建设的领导工作问题发了言。在各中央和地方报纸上有六万八千多人提出了自己的建议、意见和补充。工业和建设管理工作的改组，这是在经济管理工作方面创造性地发展了列宁的民主集中制原则，并且已经产生了有益的效果。
    在社会主义制度下，人民群众是自觉的积极的新生活的创造者。在这方面不能不指出苏联劳动人民广泛参加国民经济的国家管理这一事实。而参加管理的极为有效的形式之一便是各企业举办的生产会议和工人会议，在这些会议上工人和职员对行政工作提出批评，提出改进企业工作的建议。仅是在1956年一年内，被采纳的生产会议上提出的建议就有一千多万条。实行这些建议之后，有了很大的经济效果。
    苏维埃社会的全部生活都贯穿着社会主义民主的原则。不仅我国国家机关的工作是建立在真正民主的原则上，而且劳动人民的一切社会团体——职工会、共青团、合作社、集体农庄、文化、科学和其他团体的工作也都是建筑在真正民主的原则上。
    我国各族人民之间的兄弟友谊和合作就是苏维埃民主的巨大成就。在苏联，已经没有沙皇俄国时代所存在的经济上落后和政治上处于无权地位的民族地区，今天存在的是平等的各加盟共和国、自治共和国、自治州和民族专区。它们有着发达的工业和大规模的社会主义集体农业。我们之所以能够在苏联各族人民之间建立兄弟的友谊，这是由于共产党和苏联政府一贯执行了一切民族完全平等的列宁主义政策。
    苏维埃民主是共产主义建设和教育群众的有力武器。苏共二十次代表大会的决议和进一步改进劳动人民代表苏维埃工作以及扩大各加盟共和国职权和加强社会主义法制的一切措施，都是为了进一步巩固苏维埃社会主义民主。
    全世界都承认苏联的科学和技术所取得的成就是不可争辩的，苏联的科学和技术在十月革命光荣的四十周年的前夕在征服大自然方面取得了辉煌的成就，制成了世界上第一个人造地球卫星和洲际弹道火箭。这些卓越的成就不仅是苏联科学和苏联人民的胜利，而且又一次地证实了社会主义比资本主义的巨大优越性，证实了社会主义的社会制度比资本主义的社会制度的优越性。不仅我们的朋友们承认这一点，就连帝国主义阵营中我们的敌人也不得不承认这一点。
    亲爱的朋友们！
    苏联人民在共产主义建设事业中所获得的一切成就，都是由于共产党是苏维埃社会的领导力量和指导力量。没有以马克思列宁主义理论武装起来的，把工人阶级和人民当中一切最先进、最优秀的分子团结到自己队伍里来的共产党，我国劳动人民就不可能夺取和掌握政权、也不可能建成社会主义和走向人类光明的未来——共产主义。
    同志们：
    美帝国主义者为了在中近东建立无限制的统治，正在策划反对叙利亚这个爱好和平的国家的阴谋。这里我们要公开声明：叙利亚这个小国的命运问题已成为涉及整个世界爱好和平人民的命运的问题。而危急的对叙利亚武装冲突的危机将包藏着暴发新世界大战的危险。我国人民在中近东国家中虽然没有经济利益或其他利益，但是坚决一致的反对对叙利亚策划军事干涉的计划。世界爱好和平人民的团结一致，将会揭露战争贩子的罪恶活动并粉碎一切战争贩子的阴险阴谋。
    苏联政府和共产党非常重视全力提高苏联人民的物质生活水平和福利。我们采取了一些必要的措施，以便在最近几年大大增加食品，首先是乳类、肉和油方面的生产。我们制定了并正在实现着住宅建筑的巨大计划，这一计划使得有可能在最近十——十二年内充分满足我国劳动人民在住宅方面的需要。
    亲爱的朋友们！苏联人民在建设社会主义的过程中克服了不少困难。苏联曾经是世界上唯一的社会主义国家，当时它只能依靠自己，依靠自己的力量和资金。
  现在情况根本改变了。现在已经有了强大的社会主义阵营，伟大的中华人民共和国正在顺利地沿着社会主义的道路前进。在这种条件下，苏联人民能够比较容易地解决共产主义建设任务，是很自然的。幻想倒转历史车轮的帝国主义者的任何威胁都吓不倒社会主义阵营。
    社会主义国家的团结一致，是我们在建设社会主义和共产主义、巩固世界和平的共同事业中取得成就的保证。这个团结的基础就是中国和苏联之间永恒的和牢不可破的友谊。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！整个世界都看到苏联人民和中国人民的友谊是不可动摇的。这种友谊之所以牢不可破，是由于它是以两国人民的共同利益、他们的思想和最终目的的一致性作为基础的。我们两国人民的兄弟关系是建筑在完全平等、尊重领土完整、尊重主权、互助和互不干涉内政的原则之上的。世界上没有任何力量能够把我们分开。
    亲爱的朋友们！在全国解放和中华人民共和国成立后的几年内，中国人民在国家权力机关的工作方面、在经济和文化建设方面积累了丰富的经验。我们，苏联最高苏维埃代表们非常注意地研究了这些经验，并且认为在你们实践中的许多经验可以有成效地运用到我们国家中去。请允许我代表代表团再一次地对你们表示深深的感谢，感谢你们使我们有机会进一步了解中国人民的生活。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！当我结束我的谈话的时候，我愿向你们保证，苏联人民将尽一切努力为了我们两国人民和社会主义阵营各国人民的利益，进一步巩固和发展我们之间的友谊。
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    中国人民意志的全权体现者全国人民代表大会万岁！
    中国共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会万岁！
    中苏两国人民的永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！（附图片）
