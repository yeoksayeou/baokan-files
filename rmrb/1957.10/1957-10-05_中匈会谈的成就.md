    The Hungarian government delegation, led by Prime Minister Kádár, is about to depart today after a short visit to our country. Although this visit lasted less than ten days, the sincere friendship of the Hungarian government leaders towards our people and their warm wishes for our country's socialist construction have left a deep and unforgettable impression on our people. During the visit, the leaders of the Chinese and Hungarian governments held talks, exchanged views on the current international situation and issues related to Sino-Hungarian relations, and reached a complete consensus. The statement issued after the talks left another important page in the history of friendly relations between China and Hungary. It embodies the further strengthening and development of the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples, and once again demonstrates the determination of the two peoples to join hands and resolutely struggle for the victory of peace and socialism.
    Disarmament, the Middle East situation, and the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems are the central issues in the current international situation. Therefore, in the talks between the Chinese and Hungarian governments, attention was first focused on these major international issues. Due to the imperialist arms race and the rapid development of military technology, large-scale disarmament and an immediate ban on the production, use, and testing of nuclear weapons have become urgent. Whether this issue is resolved or not is directly related to the safety of every country in the world and the vital interests of every citizen. In order to seek a solution to the disarmament issue, the Soviet Union has made unremitting efforts and put forward reasonable proposals several times. Although the Western countries headed by the United States have repeatedly undermined disarmament negotiations, the Soviet Union still made significant constructive efforts at the recently convened 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly, advocating the implementation of partial disarmament measures first, and proposing that countries reach agreements on issues such as reducing troops and armaments, withdrawing foreign troops stationed on the territory of other countries, and undertaking not to use nuclear weapons. The joint statement of the Chinese and Hungarian governments expressed firm support for the Soviet Union's proposals on disarmament. Because if these proposals are implemented, they can greatly ease international tensions and move a big step towards the goal of lasting world peace and universal international security.
    At present, the turbulent situation in the Middle East has also aroused the attention and anxiety of people around the world. This situation is caused by the intensification of the US imperialist policy of aggression against Syria. The US ruling clique regards Syria as an important target for implementing the infamous "Eisenhower Doctrine." First, it carried out despicable subversive activities against Syria, and then exerted military pressure and even attempted to launch armed aggression to control Syria. However, in complete contrast to this aggressive action by the United States, the Soviet Union resolutely safeguarded the sovereign independence of Syria and Arab countries, and opposed imperialist interference and aggression against them. China and Hungary share the same attitude towards the situation in the Middle East and the Soviet Union. In the joint statement, both sides reiterated their support for the Syrian and Asian-African peoples' struggle against colonialism and for national independence, and resolutely condemned the US aggressive bloc's violation of the sovereignty of these countries and its actions to undermine peace in the Middle East region. At present, under the determination of the Syrian people to resist aggression and the strong opposition of world public opinion, the United States, although outwardly showing a "moderate" posture, has not actually relaxed its aggressive activities against Syria. As long as the Syrian and Arab peoples maintain a high degree of vigilance and carry out unremitting struggles, the US imperialist plot to invade Syria and create tensions in the Middle East region is bound to fail.
    In addition, the joint statement also stated that China and Hungary will develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries with different social systems based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. The two governments also support the declaration on peaceful coexistence among nations proposed by the Soviet representative at the United Nations General Assembly and the recent proposal by the Government of the Romanian People's Republic regarding the conclusion of a non-aggression pact among Balkan countries. We believe that if all countries in the world can practice peaceful coexistence based on non-aggression, then the attempt of the imperialist bloc to resolve international disputes through war will encounter serious obstacles, and international relations will be greatly improved. Regarding the issue of German reunification, both sides believe that a reasonable solution must be sought through consultations between the East and West parts of Germany based on respecting the interests of all German people. Both sides also support the positions of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union on the issue of German reunification. The two sides also shared the same views on the assessment of the overall international situation. Although the imperialist bloc is unwilling to see the prospect of peace and is doing its best to create international tensions, the fact has repeatedly proved that the forces of peace have surpassed the forces of war. As long as the people of all countries in the world do not relax their struggle against imperialist aggression for a moment, the international situation can continue to move towards easing, and the path of military conflict and war adventures can be blocked.
    China and Hungary not only hold consistent views on all major issues in the current international situation, but also have a common desire to further develop friendly cooperation between the two countries and strengthen the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. In recent years, the friendly relations between China and Hungary have greatly developed and achieved fruitful results. We have not only established fraternal cooperative relations on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect, but also provided each other with sincere support and assistance. The great proletarian internationalist spirit has closely united the people of our two countries. Through this visit by the Hungarian government delegation and the talks between the leaders of the Chinese and Hungarian governments, the mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between our two countries will inevitably be greatly strengthened. At the same time, the unity of China and Hungary has become a strong link in the unity of the entire socialist camp. In the struggle to build socialism and safeguard peace, we have received strong support from socialist countries and the sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world. All attempts by the imperialist bloc to undermine our just cause are bound to suffer a shameful defeat. The secret to the inevitable victory of our just cause lies in the fact that the source of our strength is the millions upon millions of people who have already taken control of their own destiny, and in the fact that we maintain an unbreakable unity with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The visit of the Hungarian government delegation headed by Prime Minister Kádár to our country has enabled our people to better understand the situation of socialist construction in Hungary, especially the situation after the October events. We are pleased to know that Hungary's socialist cause, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, has been greatly consolidated and strengthened compared to the past. The achievements made by the Hungarian people in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and building socialism are also the achievements of the entire socialist camp. We are deeply convinced that under the leadership of the Hungarian Party and government leaders, headed by Comrade Kádár, who are loyal to Marxism-Leninism and socialist ideals, Hungary's socialist cause will achieve more accomplishments, thereby making more contributions to world peace and the cause of socialism. As we bid farewell to the distinguished Hungarian guests with reluctance, we sincerely congratulate the Hungarian people on achieving greater victories in the noble cause of building socialism, and congratulate the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples on its consolidation and development year after year.

    中匈会谈的成就
    以卡达尔总理为首的匈牙利政府代表团，在我国进行了短期的访问后，今天就要启程回国了。这次访问虽然为时不到十天，但是匈牙利政府领导人对我国人民真挚的友情和对我国社会主义建设的亲切祝愿，却在我国人民中间留下了深刻难忘的印象。在访问期间，中匈两国政府领导人进行了会谈，对当前国际局势和有关中匈两国关系的问题交换了意见，并且取得了完全一致的看法。会谈结束后所发表的声明，在中匈两国友好关系史上又留下了重要的一页。它体现了中匈两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊已得到进一步的加强和发展，同时也再一次表明了两国人民携手为和平与社会主义事业的胜利而坚决斗争的决心。
    裁减军备、中东局势和不同社会制度的国家的和平共处，是当前国际局势中的中心问题。因此，在中匈两国政府的会谈中，也首先把注意力集中在这些重大的国际问题上。由于帝国主义的扩军备战和军事技术日新月异的发展，大规模地裁减军备和立即禁止核武器的生产使用和试验，已是刻不容缓的事情了。这个问题的解决与否，直接关系着世界每一个国家的安危和每一个公民的切身利益。为了谋求裁军问题的解决，苏联曾经作了坚持不懈的努力，几次提出了合理的建议。虽然以美国为首的西方国家屡次破坏裁军谈判，但是，苏联在最近召开的联合国第十二届大会上仍然作了重大的建设性的努力，主张首先实行局部的裁军措施，建议各国就裁减军队和军备、撤出驻在他国领土上的外国军队，各国承担不使用核武器等问题达成协议。中匈两国政府联合声明表示坚决支持苏联在裁军问题上的建议。因为这些建议如果实行，就能够大大地缓和国际紧张局势，并且会朝向世界持久和平和国际普遍安全的目标前进一大步。
    目前，中东局势的动荡也引起了各国人民的注视和不安。这种局势是由于美帝国主义加紧实行对叙利亚的侵略政策所造成的。美国统治集团把叙利亚作为推行臭名昭著的“艾森豪威尔主义”的一个重要对象。始则对叙利亚进行卑鄙的颠覆活动，继而又施加军事压力甚至企图发动武装侵略来控制叙利亚。但是同美国的这种侵略行动完全相反，苏联却坚决维护叙利亚和阿拉伯各国的主权独立，反对帝国主义对它们的干涉和侵略。中匈两国对中近东的局势和苏联抱着同样的态度。在联合声明中，双方重申支持叙利亚和亚非各国人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，坚决谴责美国侵略集团侵犯这些国家的主权和破坏中近东地区和平的行为。目前，在叙利亚人民决心抵抗侵略和全世界舆论的强烈反对下，美国虽然在表面上摆出“和缓”的姿态，但是实际上并没有放松对叙利亚的侵略活动。只要叙利亚和阿拉伯各国人民保持高度的警惕，并进行不懈的斗争，美帝国主义侵略叙利亚并在中近东地区制造紧张局势的阴谋是必然要失败的。
    此外，联合声明还表示，中匈两国将根据和平共处的原则，同一切不同社会制度的国家发展友好合作关系。两国政府并支持苏联代表在联合国大会提出的各国和平共处的宣言和罗马尼亚人民共和国政府最近提出关于缔结巴尔干各国互不侵犯公约的建议。我们认为，如果世界各国都能实行互不侵犯的和平共处，那么，帝国主义集团以战争的方式来解决国际争端的企图，就会遭到严重的障碍，国际关系就会大大地得到改善。对于德国统一问题，双方认为必须在尊重全体德国人民利益的基础上，通过德国东西两部分的协商来求得合理的解决。双方并支持德意志民主共和国和苏联在德国统一问题上的主张。在对总的国际局势的估计方面，会谈双方的看法也是一致的。虽然帝国主义集团不愿意看到和平的前景而竭力地制造国际紧张局势，但是事实已经一再地证明，和平的力量已经超过了战争的力量。只要世界各国人民一刻也不放松反对帝国主义侵略的斗争，国际局势是可以不断地趋向缓和的，军事冲突和进行战争冒险的道路是可以堵塞的。
    中匈两国不仅对当前国际局势中的一切重大问题抱有一致的见解，同时也有共同的愿望来进一步发展两国之间的友好合作和加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结。这些年来，中匈两国的友好关系已经有了很大的发展，并获得了丰富的成果。我们不但在平等互利和互相尊重的基础上建立了兄弟般的合作关系，而且还相互给予了真诚的支持和援助。伟大的无产阶级国际主义精神已把我们两国人民紧紧地结合在一起。通过匈牙利政府代表团的这次访问和中匈两国政府领导人的会谈，我们两国之间的相互了解和友好合作必然会大大地加强起来。同时，中匈两国的团结，已经成为整个社会主义阵营团结的坚强的一环。在建设社会主义和维护和平的斗争中，我们得到了社会主义各国的有力支持和全世界爱好和平的人民的同情。帝国主义集团企图破坏我们的正义事业的一切图谋，都必然要遭受可耻的失败。我们正义事业必然胜利的秘诀，就在于我们力量的源泉是千千万万已经掌握了自己命运的人民群众，就在于我们同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营保持着牢不可破的团结。
    以卡达尔总理为首的匈牙利政府代表团这次来访我国，使我国人民更好地了解了匈牙利社会主义建设的情况，特别是十月事件以后的情况。我们高兴地知道，匈牙利的社会主义事业，在匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导之下，已经比从前大大地巩固和加强了。匈牙利人民在巩固无产阶级专政和建设社会主义的斗争中所取得的成就，也就是整个社会主义阵营的成就。我们深信，在以卡达尔同志为首的忠于马克思列宁主义和社会主义理想的匈牙利党和政府领导人的领导之下，匈牙利的社会主义事业将获得更多的成就，从而对世界和平和社会主义事业作出更多的贡献。在怀着依依的心情送别匈牙利贵宾的时候，我们衷心地祝贺匈牙利人民在建设社会主义的崇高事业中取得更大的胜利，祝贺中匈两国人民的兄弟友谊年复一年地巩固和发展。
