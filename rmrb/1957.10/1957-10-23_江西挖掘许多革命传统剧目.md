Jiangxi has made great gains in excavating revolutionary traditional literature and art in the past year, with Ruijin, Ganxian, and Shicheng counties being the most prominent.

In Ruijin County, six revolutionary dramas have been excavated, including "Long Live the Victory of the Red Army," "Victory Living Newspaper," "Sending My Husband to Join the Red Army," and "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Unite"; forty dances, including "Saber Dance," "Bayonet Dance," "Women's Liberation Dance," "Labor Dance," "Four Sisters' Emancipation Dance," and "Navy Dance"; and twenty songs and ballads.

In Ganxian County, five revolutionary dramas have been excavated, including "Capturing Zhang Huizan Alive" and "Pulling Tails"; sixty dances, including "International Song Dance" and "Butterfly Dance"; and more than two hundred folk songs, suites, and ditties. What is even more valuable is that the county discovered eighteen active backbones from the Red Club era, who were all skilled theatrical and dance performers in the old Soviet area.

In addition, the county also excavated 3,942 traditional plays in Tiancun, the birthplace of Donghe Opera (a branch of Gan Opera).

In Shicheng County, four revolutionary dramas have also been excavated, including "Rich Peasants Sabotaging Production" and "Smashing the Enemy's Tortoise Shell"; and more than a dozen dances, including "The Red Army's Victory." Other counties, such as Xingguo, Ningdu, Huichang, and Dayu, have also excavated many revolutionary literary and art works such as revolutionary folk songs, dances, and dramas.

The excavated programs are all short and concise, with a strong local flavor, and are still loved by the local people.

    江西挖掘许多革命传统剧目
    近一年来，江西省挖掘革命传统文艺的工作，收获巨大，其中以瑞金、赣县、石城等县最突出。
    在瑞金县，已发掘出革命戏剧“红军胜利万岁”、“胜利活报剧”、“送郎当红军”、“工农兵团结”等六个；舞蹈“马刀舞”、“刺枪舞”、“妇女解放舞”、“劳働舞”、“四姊妹翻身舞”、“海军舞”等四十个；歌曲、歌谣二十支。
    在赣县，发掘出革命戏剧“活捉张辉赞”、“拉尾巴”等五个；舞蹈“国际歌舞”、“蝴蝶舞”等六十个；山歌、组歌、小调等二百首以上。更可贵的是该县发现了当年在红色俱乐部的十八名活动骨干，他们都是老苏区时代的戏剧舞蹈表演能手。
    此外，该县还在东河戏（赣剧的一个支派）的发源地——田村，挖掘出了三千九百四十二个传统剧目。
    在石城县，也发掘出了革命戏剧“富农破坏生产”、“打碎敌人乌龟壳”等四个，舞蹈“红军胜利了”等十数个。其它各县如兴国、宁都、会昌、大余等县，也发掘了很多革命山歌、舞蹈、戏剧等的革命文艺。
    挖掘出来的节目，都是短小精悍，有浓厚的地方色彩，至今为当地群众所喜爱。
