Second, Adapt to Local Conditions and Utilize Local Materials

In terms of mechanical power, the resources to be utilized should be appropriately considered based on the local power resource conditions. Use water where there is water, wind where there is wind, and gas where there is gas. The south and southwest have abundant water power, so small hydropower stations can be developed. Windmills can be developed in North China and the coastal areas of the Yangtze River Delta. Natural gas can be appropriately utilized in the Sichuan area. The waste gas or some heavy oil from oil refining can be utilized in areas such as Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Due to the lack of petroleum in our country, agricultural power machinery should mainly use solid fuels in the next few years, and the large-scale use of liquid fuels cannot be considered. At the same time, various power machines must be extremely adaptable to the use of various fuels to adapt to different resource conditions. For example, gas engines and steam engines should be able to adapt to various different coal qualities, and use local fuels (corn stalks, grass, etc.). In conjunction with the development of the chemical industry, we must also consider adapting to the comprehensive utilization of coal. After coal is subjected to low-temperature dry distillation to extract liquid fuels and chemical raw materials, the remaining semi-coke should be used as much as possible in rural power machinery.

The size of the power should also vary from place to place. For example, rice areas in the south require light and flexible wheeled or hand-held tractors for paddy field operations, with small horsepower. The northeast and northwest have more reclamation land, so large horsepower crawler tractors must be used. North China mainly needs medium horsepower.

In terms of mechanical performance and variety development, it is even more necessary to adapt to local conditions to suit various different natural conditions and farming requirements. For example, paddy field tractors in the south must be able to solve problems such as slipping, sinking, and wear. Key machinery for increasing the multiple cropping index in paddy fields and double-cropping areas of cotton and wheat must be solved, especially harvesters, rice transplanters, and transplanting machines.

The northeast region needs to create a set of machinery suitable for the characteristics of ridge cultivation and solve the problem of harvesting in the rainy season.

The northwest region urgently needs to solve the machinery for cotton production, especially cotton harvesting machinery.

In arid farming areas on the North China Plain, small-horsepower power machinery for multiple purposes of water lifting and irrigation should be developed.

Third, Agricultural Machinery Should Be as Versatile and Universal as Possible

In the past, imported and copied tractors and farm tools were mostly special-purpose and less versatile. Cotton planters could only plant cotton; crank arm harvesters could only cut wheat; grain threshers could only thresh wheat and beans; corn threshers could only shell corn. Most of the tractor chassis had a fixed ground clearance and wheel track, which was not convenient for inter-row cultivation. Rubber-tired tractors had no other wheels (iron wheels, half-tracks) to replace, so they could not be used in both dry and wet land. Therefore, agricultural machinery had poor adaptability. There were many types of equipment, and each operation required a different machine, which could not be universal, so the utilization rate of the machinery was very low. This is in great contradiction with the characteristics of our country's low agricultural accumulation, cheap labor, and expensive machines. Farmers in Shandong criticized tractors, saying: This "iron ox" is not as good as my ox. The "iron ox" can only plow the land, but my ox can do whatever I tell it to do. Some agricultural cooperatives used universal wheeled tractors, which could not only go to the fields for cultivation and transport on the road, but also be used for watering, chopping grass, and other operations, and were used for more than ten months a year. The water conservancy department in Henan Province proposed: to design a gas engine that can be used for watering, chopping grass, threshing grain, processing, and even equipped with a chassis that can pull a double-share plow for cultivation or as a transportation tool. This direction must be considered when designing agricultural machinery.

Fourth, It Should Be Easy to Use and Reliable, and Cheap

Agricultural machinery has many conditions to adapt to, such as uneven roads, frequent submersion in water, constant grinding of mud and sand, intermittent use, coupled with the fact that the repair locations are far away, and the farmers' level of technical proficiency is not high, so convenience and reliability are the first considerations for agricultural machinery. In the past, the low quality of farm tools seriously hindered the promotion and application of machinery. Farmers described some low-quality farm tools that broke easily with the saying: "Poke it once, two yuan and five; touch it once, three yuan and more." Some machines (such as some gas engines produced by some factories) often malfunctioned when it was most needed during the busy farming season because of poor manufacturing quality, which seriously affected production. In addition to good quality, the structure of the machine should not be too complex or too delicate. Therefore, the adoption of new technologies must consider the level and conditions of the users, and the product should be convenient and reliable.

The purchasing power in rural areas is low, so farm tools must be cheap. According to preliminary surveys, the average accumulation of each farmer per year is about four yuan. Assuming that half of this is used to purchase equipment, that is, two yuan per person per year, the national farmers' purchasing power for machinery and equipment is about ten billion yuan per year. Although such purchasing power is not small in total, it is not large for a single cooperative. Therefore, the product must be cheap in terms of farm tool design and price policy in order to adapt to the economic conditions of our rural areas.

Based on the above principles and the actual needs of rural areas, and taking into account the possibilities of the mechanical industry in manufacturing technology, we tentatively plan to focus on developing and promoting the following five types of farm tools during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

1.  Solid fuel tractors and rural power machinery. In addition to continuing to develop large and medium-sized tractors suitable for dry farming on the plains and large areas of land, we should pay more attention to developing small tractors that are more suitable for small areas of land, hills, and paddy fields in our country, and pay attention to the versatility of tractors. Try to burn coal and not use petroleum. Power machinery should mainly develop gas engines and portable steam engines. These two have their own advantages and disadvantages. Generally speaking, the thermal efficiency of gas engines is higher (about 15%), they save coal, use less steel, have low prices, are lightweight, and are easy to move (such as the 3.5-horsepower gas engine produced by Tianjin Tractor Factory, with a total weight of the engine and furnace of more than 180 kilograms). They can also be used comprehensively, but the technical requirements for use and maintenance and the requirements for fuel are relatively high. Portable steam engines have low thermal efficiency (not exceeding 3% to 6%), high cost, use a lot of steel, have high prices, and are heavy (such as a 5-horsepower portable steam engine, which actually generates more than 3 horsepower, and the total weight of the engine and furnace is as high as 800 kilograms). They are inconvenient to move, but they are easy to use and maintain and have low fuel requirements, especially suitable for those processing side businesses that require steam. In North China and the coastal areas of the Yangtze River Delta, windmills should be tested to replace some other power. Where there are hydropower resources, small hydropower machinery should be used. Diesel engines and gasoline engines should not be the direction of rural power development due to the lack of oil.

2.  Irrigation and drainage machinery. In addition to continuing to improve existing waterwheels to be used in conjunction with the development of power, we should focus on solving agricultural water pumps in different regions.

3.  Field operation, fertilization machinery and pest and disease control machinery. Rice is one of the main sources of food in our country. At present, the lack of labor has seriously affected the increase in the multiple cropping index and further intensive cultivation. Therefore, we should focus on solving the main rice machinery, such as paddy field plows, rice transplanters, inter-row weeding implements, etc. State-owned farms and sparsely populated areas can continue to use foreign farm tools that have been imitated, improved, and designed to suit the characteristics and requirements of the region. In the vast arid plains, new products should be designed according to the needs of farmers, selecting locations with high economic benefits and important operation links, such as harvesters, transplanters, and machinery for applying and sowing chemical fertilizers (such as liquid ammonia or ammonia water).

4.  Side business and processing machinery. First of all, agricultural machinery should be used to engage in side businesses to keep people, machines, and animals busy during the slack season. Many places use tractors to transport manure and use machine power to process by-products during the slack season, so that the machines have work to do during the slack season, which increases the income of the cooperative members. Well-managed cooperatives have side business income of 30%-40%. Secondly, it is also necessary to design machines for side businesses in response to the needs of side business development.

The significance of carrying out side product processing in rural areas is not only to increase farmers' income, but also to prevent excessive concentration of population in cities and the influx of mountain people into the plains. Therefore, some industries that can be located in the city can also be located in the countryside. They should be located in the countryside as agricultural side businesses, which is beneficial to both rural and urban areas. We must pay attention to solving the machine problems required for side business production based on this development trend.

5.  Rural transportation machinery. After agricultural cooperation, the development of intensive cultivation, the expansion of production and operation areas, the increase in cash crops, the development of urban-rural relations, and the increase in the amount of agricultural material transportation. At present, many areas have experienced a shortage of transportation capacity. Therefore, we must improve the existing transportation tools of human and animal power, improve efficiency, and design tractor carriages to make tractors also used for transportation. We should also pay attention to developing gas-powered vehicles suitable for rural areas.

Solving the above problems is not easy and requires a lot of investigation, research, and experimentation. It is a relatively long-term task. We will make every effort to strengthen our work in this area to promote the realization of these tasks.

Problems in the Manufacture, Promotion, and Leadership of Agricultural Machinery

Agricultural machinery factories exist in various places, and the types of agricultural machinery are very complicated. Farmers have no experience in using machines, and the old rural farm tool repair forces are not suitable for repairing new machinery. Therefore, the manufacture and promotion of agricultural machinery is a very complicated problem.

(1) In terms of agricultural machinery manufacturing, the first is the arrangement of production, so that central enterprises and local enterprises are combined, and machine manufacturing and parts manufacturing are taken into account. In the case of decentralized manufacturing, the machine type must be carefully selected and the quality strictly controlled. The technical drawings and technical standards of major products should be uniformly calibrated by the central or local competent authorities. Before the machine is put into formal production, it must go through field trials, appraisal, and trial production procedures before organizing suitable factories to produce it. Production must strictly implement technical standards to ensure quality, ensure that parts are interchangeable, and facilitate repair and replacement. The experience of promoting double-wheeled double-share plows in the past was to concentrate the drawings of double-wheeled double-share plows manufactured in various places, study the usage, collectively review them, learn from each other's strengths, calibrate several standard drawings and technical standards, and then organize relevant factories to manufacture them accordingly to ensure quality. As for the accidents that occurred in some areas later with double-wheeled double-share plows, it was because we produced fewer varieties, and there were no paddy field plows or mountain plows. It was a failure to force farm tools that were originally for dry farming areas to go up the mountains and down the water. As long as there are large livestock, this new type of farm tool is still suitable for dry farming areas. As for general simple farm tools, the technology is simple or has been finalized, so the local areas can arrange tasks in accordance with local conditions under the national plan. In order to better organize the manufacture of agricultural machinery, the First Ministry of Machine Building has concentrated the tractor, farm tool, and rural power machinery that were originally managed by three bureaus into one management bureau. Corresponding adjustments and strengthening are also being made to research and design institutions, and measures are being taken to make the research work of agricultural machinery more closely linked with factory production, user departments, and rural areas. We are also preparing to contact the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Land Reclamation, etc. to prepare to convene a national agricultural machinery meeting to discuss the national plan for agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair to make a more rational division of labor for national agricultural machinery factories. In the future, central and local enterprises directly under the central government with a strong foundation will be designated to be responsible for the design and technical guidance of major products, while making full use of the production and technical capabilities of all local agricultural machinery factories to manufacture various agricultural machinery and parts, and undertake farm tool repair and technical service work.

(2) Issues of promotion work. Agricultural machinery is characterized by scattered use, inconsistent use conditions, and farmers lack experience and habits in using modern machinery. The old handicraft workshops in rural areas that repair old-fashioned farm tools are no longer able to meet the needs of machinery repair. Therefore, how to do a good job in promotion and organization service is an extremely important issue.

The first issue in promotion work is that important farm tools must be tested in different regions in advance, and can only be promoted on a large scale after practical proof that they are indeed applicable. This procedure must be institutionalized, just like the construction procedures stipulated in basic construction. Only in this way can waste and losses be avoided and agricultural production will not be delayed.

Secondly, technical training must be done well before machines can be used, and users must learn and do at the same time in actual operation to continuously improve their skills. Many agricultural machinery has a low utilization rate and frequent damage. In addition to some of them being due to poor product quality, many are due to the problem of not knowing how to use them. For example, in the past, we produced high-speed gasoline engine-driven sprayers and powder machines. Because the engine was high-speed, the technology of use could not be mastered, and they could not spray out when the time came. The utilization rate of portable steam engines used in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi last year was only 40%. After the training work and technical training were followed up, the utilization rate has increased to 75% this year. The middle school graduates and cadres who have recently been mobilized to go to the countryside are a huge force for improving the cultural and technical level of rural areas. Many of them can participate in learning to master the technology of agricultural machinery. As for the teachers needed to conduct technical education for farmers, the machinery factory should be responsible for equipping them at the beginning, and then gradually train local teachers. The machinery factory should be responsible until the local area can fully undertake the technical training work.

(3) Machine repair and parts supply issues. The existing repair force in rural areas (shoeing horses, blacksmith shops, cart repair shops, bicycle shops, etc.) is matched with general manual and animal-powered farm tools. The repair of new-style animal-powered farm tools is already difficult, and the problem is even greater when machines go to the countryside. Being able to repair or not is a big problem in the promotion of farm tools. Cooperative cadres said: "If people don't work, I can talk about Marxism-Leninism (mobilize them to work); if animals don't work, I will whip them; if machines don't work, I have no way!" Often, a screw or small part worth only a few cents has to spend more than ten yuan in travel expenses to go to a city far away to buy it, and the machine is stopped and cannot be used. Therefore, how to organize repair work throughout the vast rural areas is a major issue. Local agricultural and mechanical industry departments should, under the leadership of local party committees and governments, make plans, formulate measures, and organize or enrich the necessary mechanical repair factories, repair stations, and mobile repair teams at the provincial, prefectural, county, and community levels according to the needs of major, medium, and minor repairs. Attention should be paid to reforming and utilizing the original repair force. For the parts used for repair and replacement, especially vulnerable parts, the supply organization should store them according to the reserve quota, and submit orders to the manufacturing plant on time according to the consumption of the reserve amount. The production of accessories should be included in the national plan for agricultural machinery production.

(4) The issue of unified leadership in the use of agricultural machinery. At present, agricultural planning and agricultural technology leadership are under the agricultural system; tractor stations are under the agricultural system, but directly under the province; irrigation and drainage are under the water conservancy system; reclamation is under the land reclamation system; and side business and processing are under the cooperative system. But these tasks must be considered comprehensively in rural areas. For example, the power machinery used in rural areas may be used for both farming and watering, as well as for side businesses and processing. If there is a lack of unified planning and decentralized management, it is easy to do things in separate ways, with more investment and low utilization rate. According to the pilot project in Beijing, a 25-horsepower tractor could only be used for two or three months a year when it was in the station; after it was distributed to the community for management, it could be used for more than eight or nine months. The management system of the tractor station is separated from the agricultural production cooperative, and the production plan of the cooperative and the contract farming plan of the tractor are prone to disconnection and poor coordination. Now the contracting system of the production team of the cooperative divides the land into very small pieces, which is also in conflict with the need for large pieces of land for machine farming. The current situation of these systems is in conflict with the requirements for the rational use of agricultural machinery and is worth studying in detail.

(5) Agricultural mechanization is a long-term and complex task that involves a wide range of issues. We suggest that the central government organize a special team to strengthen the leadership of this work.

We do not know much about the situation in rural areas. We hope that comrades will provide more comments to guide and help us do a good job in agricultural machinery work. (End)

    我国农业机械化问题
    国家技术委员会主任　黄敬
    （续昨）
    第二、要因地制宜，就地取材
    在机械动力方面，利用什么资源，应该根据地区动力资源情况适当考虑。靠水就使水，有风就用风，有气就用气。南方和西南的水力多，可以发展一些小水电站；华北、江南沿海可以发展一些风车；四川地区可适当利用天然气；甘肃、青海、新疆一带可利用炼油的废气或部分重油；广大的产煤区可以烧煤或烧半焦炭。由于我国石油缺乏，农业动力机械在今后若干年内，基本上应以固体燃料为主，不能考虑大量使用液体燃料。同时，各种动力机械还要极力适应多种燃料的使用，以适应不同的资源条件。如煤气机、蒸气机就应当能适应各种不同的煤质，以及利用当地燃料（玉米秆、草……等）配合化学工业的发展，我们还要考虑适应煤的综合利用，把煤经过低温干馏，取出液体燃料和化工原料以后，剩下来的半焦炭尽量在农村动力机械中使用。
    动力的大小也要因地而异。例如南方水稻地区要求轻巧灵便的水田作业轮式的或手扶的拖拉机，马力要小；东北及西北的垦荒地多，就必须解决大马力的履带式拖拉机；华北则主要是需要中等马力的。
    在机械性能和品种发展方面，更要因地制宜以适应各种不同的自然条件和耕作要求。如南方水田拖拉机要能解决打滑、下陷、磨损等问题。水田和棉麦两熟地区要解决提高复种指数的关键性机械，特别是收获机、插秧机、移植机等。
    东北地区则需要创制适合垅作特点的一套机械，并解决雨季收获的问题。
    西北地区极需解决棉花生产的机械，特别是棉花收获机械。
    华北平原旱作地区，要发展小马力的、作为多种用途的提水灌溉动力机械。
    第三、要尽可能使农业机械万能化、通用化
    过去进口和仿造的拖拉机和农具，专用的多，万能的少。棉花播种机只能种棉花；摇臂收割机只能割麦子；谷物脱粒机只能打麦、豆；玉米脱粒机只能剥玉米。拖拉机大部分底盘距地面的距离和轮距都是死的，就不便于中耕；胶轮拖拉机无其他轮子（铁轮、半履带）更换，就不能在干旱地和潮湿地两用。因此，农业机械的适应性差，设备品种很多，每一个作业，就要一种机器，不能通用，所以机械的利用率很低。这和我们农业积累少、人工便宜、机器贵的特点矛盾很大。山东农民批评拖拉机说：这个“铁牛”不如我那个牛好，“铁牛”只能耕地，我那个牛叫它干什么活能干什么活。有些农业社使用了万能轮式拖拉机，不但能下地耕种，上路运输，而且可作打水、铡草等作业，每年使用到十个月以上。河南省的水利部门提出：要求设计一种煤气机，能够用来打水、铡草、脱谷、加工，甚至配上底盘还能拖一个双铧犁耕地或做运输工具用。这种方向是在设计农业机械时必须考虑的。
    第四、要使用方便可靠，价钱便宜
    农业机械要适应的使用条件很多，例如：路不平，常下水，泥砂天天磨，时用时停，加以修配地点离得远，农民的使用技术水平还不高，因此，方便可靠是农业机械第一要考虑的问题。过去农具质量低劣的情况，很妨害机具的推广应用。农民形容某些质量低劣一碰就坏的农具说：“杵一杵，两块五；摸一摸，三块多”。有些机器（如有些厂出的煤气机）因为制造的质量不好，往往在农忙要命的时候出故障，更是严重影响生产。除了质量要好以外，机器的结构上不能太复杂、太娇嫩，因此，新的技术的采用，必须考虑使用者的水平和条件，产品应该是方便可靠的。
    农村的购买力低，因此农具必须价钱便宜。据初步调查，每个农民每年的积累平均约四元左右，假设其中一半用来购置设备，即每人每年二元，全国农民对机器设备的购买力每年约在十亿元左右。这样的购买力，在总数上虽然不少，在一个社来说是不大的。因此，在农具设计及价格政策上，必须使产品低廉，才能适应我国农村的经济条件。
    根据上述原则和农村实际需要的情况，同时结合考虑机械工业在制造技术上的可能性，我们初步打算在第二个五年计划期内，着重发展和推广下面五类农具。
    1、固体燃料的拖拉机及农村动力机械。除了继续发展适于平原旱作、大片土地用的大中型拖拉机以外，我们更要注意发展比较适合我国小片土地、丘陵、水田等用的小型拖拉机，注意拖拉机的万能性。尽量烧煤，不用石油。动力机械主要发展煤气机和锅驼机，这两者各有其优缺点，一般说来，煤气机的热效率是较高的（15％左右），耗煤省，用钢材少，售价低，重量轻，移动方便（如天津拖拉机厂出产煤气机三·五马力，机炉共重一百八十多公斤），也可以综合利用，但是对使用保养的技术和对燃料的要求都较高。锅驼机的热效率低（不超过3％至6％）成本高，使用钢铁量多，售价贵，重量较大（如五马力锅驼机，实发三马力多，机炉总重达八百公斤），移动不便，但是使用保养方便，对燃料要求不高，特别是适用于那些需要蒸汽的加工副业等。在华北、江南沿海地区应试用风车以代替部分其他动力。有水力资源的地方，应使用小型水力机械。柴油机和汽油机，因为缺油，不应该是农村动力发展的方向。
    2、灌溉排水机械。除了继续改进现有水车，以便与动力的发展配合使用外，应着重解决不同地区的农用水泵。
    3、田间作业、施肥机械及病虫药械。水稻为我国主要粮食来源之一，目前因劳力不足，已经严重地影响复种指数的提高和进一步精耕细作，因此应该重点解决主要的水稻机械，如水田犁、插秧机、中耕锄草器等。国营农场及地广人稀地区可继续使用仿造外国农具，加以改良设计，以适合于地区的特点和要求。在广大平原旱地应根据农民要求，选择经济效果较高的地点和重要的作业环节，设计新的产品，如收获机，移植机，施播化学肥料（如液体胺或胺水）的机械等。
    4、副业及加工机械。首先要利用农业机器来兼搞副业，使农闲时人、机、畜都不闲着，有活干。许多地方利用拖拉机送粪搞运输，利用机器动力在农闲时作副产的加工，使机器在农闲时有活干，增加了社员收入。经营得好的合作社，副业收入有到30％—40％的。其次，也需要针对着副业发展的需要，设计副业用的机器。
    农村中开展副产加工的意义，还不仅在于增加农民收入，还可防止人口在城市过度集中和山区人口的流入平原。因此，把一些可以放在城里，也可以放在乡下的工业，应该尽可能地放在乡村，作为农业副业，这对农村和城市都是有利的。我们要根据这一发展趋势，注意解决适应副业生产所需要的机器问题。
    5、农村运输机械。农业合作化以后，精耕细作的发展，生产作业的面积扩大，商品作物的增加，城乡关系的发展，农业物料的运输量随之增加。目前许多地区已经出现了运输力不足的现象。因此，要改进现有的人畜力的运输工具，提高效率，同时应设计拖拉机的车斗，使拖拉机兼作运输用，还要注意发展适合农村用的煤气汽车。
    解决以上问题是不容易的，要作许多调查、研究、试验工作，是一个比较长期的任务。我们将尽一切努力，加强这方面的工作，以促进这些任务的实现。
    农业机械的制造、推广和领导问题
    农业机械厂各地都有，农业机械的种类又很复杂，农民没有使用机器的经验，农村旧有的修理农具力量不适于修理新式机械，因此，农业机械的制造和推广，是一个很复杂的问题。
    （一）在农业机械制造问题上，首先是生产的安排，要使中央企业和地方企业相结合，同时机器制造和配件制造要兼顾。在分散制造情况下，必须慎重地选择机型，严格控制质量。对重大产品的技术图纸和技术标准应由中央或地方的主管机构，负责进行统一的标定。机器在投入正式生产以前，必须要经过田间试验、鉴定、试制等程序以后再组织合适的工厂生产，生产要严格执行技术标准，以保证质量，保证零件能互换，便于修配。过去推行双轮双铧犁的经验，就是把各地制造的双轮双铧犁图纸集中，研究使用的情况，集体审议，取长补短，标定出几种标准的图纸和技术标准，然后组织有关工厂按此制造，保证了质量。至于以后双轮双铧犁在有些地区出了事故，那是因为我们生产的品种少，没有水田犁和山地犁，把本来是旱作地区的农具，硬要它上山、下水才失败的。这种新式农具在旱作地区，只要有大牲口，还是很适用的。至于一般的简易农具，技术简单，或已定型，则可以在全国规划下，由地方因地制宜，安排任务。为了更好组织农业机械的制造，第一机械工业部已经把原来分散在三个局管理的拖拉机、农具和农村用的动力机械，集中到一个管理局管理。对研究、设计机构，也正在作相应的调整和加强，并且正在采取措施，使农业机械的研究工作与工厂生产、与使用部门、与农村的联系更加密切。我们还准备和水利部、农业部、农垦部等联系，筹备召集全国的农业机械工厂，开一次全国性的农业机械会议，讨论农业机械制造和修配的全国规划，使全国农业机械工厂进行更合理的分工。今后要指定中央直属的和基础较强的地方企业，负责重大产品设计和技术指导的工作，同时充分利用地方一切农业机械工厂的生产和技术能力，分工制造各种农业机械和配件，并且担负农具修配和技术服务工作。
      （二）推广工作问题。农业机械的特点是使用分散，使用条件很不一致，同时，农民还缺乏使用现代机械的经验和习惯，乡村中修理旧式农具的手工业作坊已经不能适应机器修配的需要。因此，如何做好推广和组织服务工作，是一个极重要的问题。
    推广工作的第一个问题，就是重要的农具必须事前分区进行试验，经过实践证明确属适用之后，才能大量推广。这种程序必须形成制度，好像基本建设中规定的建设程序一样，只有这样，才能避免浪费损失，不至耽误农业生产。
    其次，必须先做好技术传授工作，然后才能动用机器，并在实际操作中边学边做，不断提高使用者的技术。许多农业机械使用率低，损坏频繁，除了有些是由于产品质量不好以外，许多是由于不会使用的问题。例如，过去我们生产高速汽油机带动的喷雾粉机，因为发动机是高速的，使用技术掌握不了，到时就喷不出来。河北、山东、山西使用的锅驼机，去年使用率只达到40％，而在训练工作、技术传授跟上了以后，今年使用率已提高到75％。最近动员下乡的中小学毕业生和干部，是提高农村文化、技术水平的一支巨大的力量，其中的许多人，都可以参加学习掌握农业机械的技术。至于对农民进行技术教育所需要的师资，最初要由机械工厂负责配备，然后逐步培养当地的师资，机械工厂要负责到当地能够自己完全担负技术传授工作为止。
      （三）机器修配和配件的供应问题。农村现有的一套修配力量（钉马掌、打铁铺、大车修理店、自行车店等），是配合一般人力和畜力农具的，新式的畜力农具修配已经有困难，机器一下乡，问题就更多。能修不能修，是推广农具中一个大问题。社干部们说：“人不干活，我可以讲马列主义（动员他干）；牲口不干活，我打他一鞭子；机器不干活，我就没有办法了！”往往有只值几角钱的螺丝钉、小零件，要花十几块钱路费，跑到很远的城里去买，而机器停着不能用。因此，如何组织遍布在广大农村中的修理工作是一件大事情。地方的农业和机械工业部门应在地方党政的领导下，做出规划，拟订措施，按照大、中、小修的需要，省、专区、县、社各级分工，组织或充实必要的机械修配厂、修配站及流动的修理工作队。对原有的修配力量应注意改造和利用。对修换用的配件，特别是易损零件，应由供应机构按储备定额进行储备，并按储备量的消耗情况，按时集中向制造厂提出订货。在农业机械生产的全国规划中，应把配件的生产列入计划。
      （四）农业机械使用的统一领导问题。现在农业规划和农业技术领导归农业系统；拖拉机站归农业系统，但直属省管；排灌归水利系统；开垦归农垦系统；副业及加工归合作社系统。但是这些工作在农村里是要综合考虑的。比如农村采用的动力机械，就可能是既耕作又打水，还要作副业和加工。如果缺乏统一规划，分散管理，就很容易各搞一套，投资多，利用率低。据北京市的试点，一台热持二五拖拉机，原来在站里时，一年只能用二、三个月；分给社里管理之后，就可以用到八、九个月以上。拖拉机站的管理系统和农业生产合作社分开，社的生产计划和拖拉机的代耕计划就容易脱节，配合不好。现在合作社的生产队的包工制度，把地块分割得很小，和机耕需要大块土地也有矛盾。这些体制的现状和合理使用农业机械的要求是有矛盾的，值得进行详细研究。
    （五）农业机械化是一个长期的、复杂的工作，牵涉的面又很广，我们建议中央组织一个专门小组，来加强对这项工作的领导。
    我们对农村情形了解不多，这些看法是否正确，希望同志们多提意见，指导和帮助我们把农业机械工作做好。　（完）
