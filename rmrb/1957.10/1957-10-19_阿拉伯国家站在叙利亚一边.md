　　阿拉伯国家站在叙利亚一边
　　沙特重申全力援助叙利亚抵抗侵略；约旦国王向美英土三国表示侵略叙利亚就是侵略约旦；黎巴嫩议会外委会要求政府支持叙利亚；伊拉克同意保障叙利亚的安全、独立和主权。
    本报综合报道  据新华社18日讯：阿拉伯国家首脑和政界，包括约旦国王、黎巴嫩议会外交委员会和伊拉克官方人士，纷纷对叙利亚表示支持。
    贝鲁特消息：据官方人士宣布，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特10月17日决定把他在黎巴嫩的十天访问加以延长。他原来预定在19日回国。据西方通讯社报道，他的这个决定同他关于调停叙利亚同黎巴嫩和约旦的关系的计划有关。
    沙特国王曾经同叙利亚总统库阿特利举行了十五分钟的电话谈话。然后他又同黎巴嫩总统夏蒙在山区游览胜地阿来举行了商谈。据沙特国王的顾问说，这两次会谈都讨论了关于土耳其和叙利亚的局势最近在全世界引起的发展。
    同时，约旦驻黎巴嫩大使阿卜杜勒·莫奈姆·里法伊17日回国向约旦国王侯赛因递交了沙特国王的一封信。据说内容是请侯赛因国王去贝鲁特访问。有消息说，侯赛因国王可能在20日前去贝鲁特。
    据中东通讯社报道，沙特国王在17日接见了黎巴嫩前总理萨兰姆和属于黎巴嫩反对党的几位前总理。据萨兰姆说，沙特国王表示“决心调用沙特阿拉伯的一切力量，援助叙利亚反抗任何侵略”。
    据报纸报道，约旦国王侯赛因邀见了美国、英国和土耳其的外交代表，并且对他们说，约旦将认为对叙利亚的任何侵略行动就是对约旦自己的侵略行动。约旦国王也已把约旦的这种立场通知阿拉伯各国的外交代表。
    黎巴嫩议会外交委员会17日通过建议，要求政府“把一切政治和军事力量供叙利亚使用，以支持叙利亚抵抗不论来自何方的任何侵略”。
    外交委员会听取了黎巴嫩武装部队总司令法德·谢哈布将军和代理外交部长迈卡维关于土耳其——叙利亚局势的报告，随后提出了这项建议。
    与此同时，黎巴嫩“民族阵线”就土耳其军队继续在叙利亚边境集结一事发表声明说，这种行动侵犯叙利亚的独立和主权，并且违背联合国宪章的精神和条文。
    这项声明指出，“民族阵线”完全赞同埃及军队根据叙埃两国共同防御条约开到叙利亚。声明强调指出，黎巴嫩人民支持叙利亚人民。
    另据巴格达消息：伊拉克巡回大使达姆卢吉10月16日说，伊拉克和沙特阿拉伯“一致同意要保障叙利亚的安全，独立和主权”。他还说：“不论叙利亚遭到什么危害，都将被认为对所有阿拉伯人民的危害。”
