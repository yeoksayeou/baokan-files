    Staff of the State Construction Commission
    Expose Jiang Weihong and Others' Anti-Party Fallacies
    (Our dispatch) The State Construction Commission and its affiliated Basic Construction Publishing House and Regional Planning Bureau have recently held numerous meetings over the past two months to conduct fierce debates and criticisms against the reactionary words and deeds of Jiang Weihong, Peng Jiajie, Xu Jinxing, and others.
    Jiang Weihong of the State Construction Commission is an anti-Party, anti-socialist rightist element disguised as a Communist Party member. As early as before the Party's Eighth National Congress, he launched a vicious attack on our nation's socialist system. Using the excuse of writing an article to offer as a gift to the "Eighth Congress," he described our country's economic, cultural, personnel, and security systems as a complete mess in that article. He smeared our country, saying that we are currently employing a "semi-wartime management system, which seriously hinders the people from exercising their creative freedom." He arrogantly put forward a series of bourgeois programs, opposed the planned economy, and demanded the implementation of so-called "free competition." He opposed the unified personnel system, proposing to implement a "free cadre market." He opposed the socialist ownership system, advocating that factories, enterprises, schools, newspapers, and other institutions be handed over to so-called "private management." Even more arrogantly, he demanded that the Party revise its constitution according to his intentions, wanting to add all sorts of dirty things like "a scholar dies for his benefactor" and "brotherly loyalty" into the Party constitution. What was especially arrogant was that even when the anti-rightist struggle in various regions had already entered an in-depth stage, he still released a series of vicious anti-Party remarks. He slandered, saying, "Old cadres cannot lead professional work."
    Currently, the staff of the State Construction Commission are concentrating their efforts to launch a comprehensive and in-depth reasoned struggle against this anti-Party element full of poisonous stench.
    The anti-communist remarks of rightist Peng Jiajie (Communist Youth League member, assistant editor of Construction Monthly) are extremely systematic. He first attacked the Party's leadership, saying, "The Communist Party and the masses have no common language." He supported the fallacy of "Party-led world," demanding that the Communist Party "pay sufficient attention." He smeared by saying, "Indeed, quite a few people were wrongly struggled against in the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries, not just one or two, but a social problem." He also said, "Whether or not to fight in the Korean War is worth considering. The Korean War isolated us and made us lose international aid." This rightist is not only filled with anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, but his mind has also been permeated with bourgeois selfish and self-serving thoughts. He even praised the saying "He would not pluck out a single hair to benefit the world" as having "a certain truth."
    The staff of the Basic Construction Publishing House have successively held eighteen reasoned struggle meetings, but this rightist's attitude is extremely dishonest. Sometimes he attempts to use the trick of feigning illness to ask for leave, evading the criticism of the masses, and sometimes he looks for sympathy among the masses or denies and quibbles. The staff of the Basic Construction Publishing House have issued a serious warning to Peng Jiajie; they will never give up until Peng Jiajie bows his head and admits his guilt.
    During the "blooming and contending" period, the rightist Xu Jinxing of the Regional Planning Bureau spread a lot of absurd remarks. He said something like "The Party's ruling position is the objective basis of the three evils." Attempting to use this to provoke the relationship between the people and the Party. He also clamored that "grassroots Party organizations should not form their own systems, and Party committee secretaries should implement a rotation system," attempting to abolish the Party's grassroots organizations. After many comrades refuted this rightist with concrete facts and sufficient reasoning at multiple debate meetings, he felt that his arguments were exhausted and he had to shut up, admit his guilt, acknowledge that his remarks were anti-Party and anti-socialist, and express his willingness to thoroughly transform himself.

### 国家建设委员会工作人员  揭发蒋惟泓等的反党谬论

    国家建设委员会工作人员
    揭发蒋惟泓等的反党谬论
    本报讯　国家建设委员会及所属基本建设出版社和区域规划局，在最近两个多月召开了多次会议，对蒋惟泓、彭家杰、徐进兴等的反动言行进行了激烈的论战和批判。
    国家建设委员会的蒋惟泓是个披着共产党员外衣的反党反社会主义的右派分子。早在党的第八次代表大会前夕，他就向我们国家社会主义制度进行了恶毒的攻击。他借口写文章向“八大”献礼，在那篇文章中就把我国的经济、文化、人事、保密等制度都说成一团糟。他污蔑说我们国家目前是采用的“半军事时期的管理制度，严重地妨碍了人民发挥创造性的自由”。他狂妄地提出一系列的资产阶级纲领，反对计划经济，要求实行所谓“自由竞争”；他反对统一的人事制度，他提出要实行什么“干部自由市场”；他反对社会主义所有制制度，主张工厂、企业、学校、报刊等都交给所谓“民办”；他更狂妄地要求党按照他的意图修改党章，他要把什么“士为知己者死”、“哥们义气”等乌七八糟的东西加到党章里去。尤其狂妄的是当各地反右派斗争已经进入深入阶段，他还放出了一系列恶毒的反党言论。他污蔑说：“老干部不能领导专业。”
    目前国家建设委员会的工作人员们正集中力量，对这个满身毒臭的反党分子展开全面的深入的说理斗争中。
    右派分子彭家杰（共青团员，建设月刊的助理编辑）的反共言论，是极其有系统的，他首先攻击的是党的领导，他说：“共产党和群众没有共同语言”，他支持“党天下”谬论，要共产党“引起足够注意”。他污蔑说“肃反斗错了的确实不少，不是一个两个，而是社会问题”。他还说：“抗美援朝打不打值得考虑，抗美援朝使我们孤立了，使我们失掉了国际援助”。这个右派分子不但充满着反党反社会主义的言论，并且他的脑子已浸透了资产阶级自私自利的思想，他甚至颂扬“拔一毛而利天下不为也”的话“有一定的道理”。
    基本建设出版社的工作人员们已先后召开了十八次说理斗争大会，但这个右派分子态度极不老实。有时企图利用装病请假的办法，逃避群众的批判，有时又在群众中寻找同情，或抵赖狡辩。基本建设出版社的工作人员们已向彭家杰提出严重的警告，彭家杰要不低头认罪他们就决不罢休。
    区域规划局右派分子徐进兴在“鸣放”期间，散布了不少的荒谬言论。他说什么“党的统治地位是三害的客观基础”。企图以此挑拨人民群众和党的关系。他还叫嚣什么“基层党组织不要自成系统，党委书记应该实行换班制”，企图取消党的基层组织。这个右派分子在多次的论战会上，经过很多同志以具体事实和充分的道理的批驳以后，已感到理屈词穷，不得不哑口无言低头认罪，承认自己的言论是反党反社会主义的，并表示愿意彻底改造自己。
