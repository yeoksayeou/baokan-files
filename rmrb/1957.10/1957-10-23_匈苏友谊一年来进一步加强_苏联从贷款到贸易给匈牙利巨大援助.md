Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, October 22nd: Demeter, Secretary of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Association, recently told our reporter that in the past year, Hungarian-Soviet friendship has not only been further strengthened, but is now better and more sincere than ever before.

The secretary cited many examples to illustrate that the sincere friendship towards the Soviet Union emanates from the depths of people's hearts. He said that when the Soviet delegation of Old Bolsheviks came to Hungary this time, they were warmly invited to visit by people from all over the country. I calculated that if they were to visit all the places that extended invitations, it would probably take them five years to complete the tour.

He also mentioned that the Hungarian people view the Soviet Union's launched artificial "moon" with affection. People say, "This is our own," and are overjoyed by the socialist camp's achievement.

Demeter also said that recently, workers from the Csepel Iron and Steel Works and the "May 1st" Garment Factory have initiated the construction of a monument to the Soviet Army martyrs. This stems from their deep understanding that the Soviet Army once again saved Hungary, and from their heartfelt respect and friendship. This is not something that can be achieved through orders.

Speaking about how the enemy is trying every means to sow discord in Hungarian-Soviet relations, Demeter said that the enemy hates the unity and friendship between the Hungarian and Soviet peoples. They have engaged in extensive propaganda, spreading rumors and slanders, claiming that Hungarian-Soviet trade is not mutually beneficial and that the Soviet Union has been exploiting Hungary for twelve years, etc. But what are the facts? Taking trade with the Soviet Union as an example, looking at past Hungarian-Soviet trade, the majority of imports from the Soviet Union were raw materials and fuels for power; while Hungary exported mostly manufactured goods, and some consumer goods, to the Soviet Union. This clearly shows who Hungarian-Soviet trade benefits. Moreover, the huge assistance the Soviet Union has provided to Hungary since the October incident last year, from loans to trade, is well known.

Demeter emphasized that Hungarian-Soviet relations are based on equality and mutual benefit. The facts cannot be denied. Our shortcoming is that we did not explain these issues clearly to the people in the past, so many people were deceived by the enemy. However, based on their own personal experiences, the Hungarian people are determined not to fall again into the abyss of fascist rule like when the Soviet regime was overthrown in 1919. Now, the vast majority of those who were deceived have seen the essence of the October incident, which has greatly promoted the development of Hungarian-Soviet friendship.

Demeter also cited the development of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Association's work in the past year to illustrate this point. He said that the enemy wanted to destroy the Hungarian-Soviet Association (formerly known as the "Hungarian-Soviet Association" before the incident). However, shortly after the incident, many places automatically re-established the association's organization, and did a lot of work to expose counter-revolutionary rumors and defend Hungarian-Soviet friendship. This shows that the people understand and cherish Hungarian-Soviet friendship. Now, Hungary is preparing to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. The activities of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Association organizations in various places have become more active.

### 匈苏友谊一年来进一步加强  苏联从贷款到贸易给匈牙利巨大援助

    匈苏友谊一年来进一步加强
    苏联从贷款到贸易给匈牙利巨大援助
    新华社布达佩斯22日电　匈苏友好协会书记德梅特最近对本社记者说，近一年来，匈苏友谊不仅进一步加强了，而且比以前任何时候都更好、更真诚了。
    这位书记举出了许多事例来说明对苏联的真诚友谊是从人们的内心深处发出的。他说，在这次苏联老布尔什维克代表团来到匈牙利的时候，全国各地都热情地邀请他们去访问。我计算了一下，如果他们把所有提出邀请的地方都跑遍，那恐怕五年也是访问不完的。
    他又谈到，对于苏联放射的人造“月亮”，匈牙利人民是怀着亲切的感情来看待的。人们都说，“这是我们自己的”，并且为社会主义阵营有了这样的成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    德梅特还说，最近，切佩尔钢铁厂和“五一”服装厂的工人，都倡议修建苏军烈士墓。这是由于他们深切体会到苏军再一次拯救了匈牙利而从内心发出的尊敬和友谊。这不是什么命令可以办得到的。
    谈到敌人如何千方百计地挑拨匈苏关系，德梅特说，敌人是仇视匈苏人民的团结和友谊的。他们曾经大事宣传，造谣污蔑，说什么匈苏贸易并非互利、苏联十二年来一直剥削匈牙利等等。但是事实是怎样的呢？就拿同苏联的贸易来说，总括过去的匈苏贸易来看，从苏联输入的大部分是原料以及动力用的燃料；而匈牙利向苏联输出的多半是制成品，一部分是消费品。这就可以很明显地看出来匈苏贸易是对谁有利的。而去年十月事件后苏联从贷款到贸易方面给予匈牙利的巨大援助，更是众所周知的了。
    德梅特强调说，匈苏关系是建立在平等互利的基础上的。事实是不能抹杀的。缺点是我们过去没有把这些问题向人民说清楚，因此有许多人曾经受了敌人的欺骗。但是匈牙利人民根据自己切身的体会，决不愿意再陷入像1919年苏维埃政权被颠覆时那样的法西斯统治的深渊中。现在绝大部分被欺骗的人已经看清了去年十月事件的本质，这就大大地促进了匈苏友谊的发展。
    德梅特还举出一年来匈苏友协工作的发展来说明这一点。他说，敌人是想搞垮匈苏协会（事件前称为“匈苏协会”）的。但是在事件后不久，已经有许多地方自动重新建立了协会的组织，为揭露反革命的谣言、捍卫匈苏友谊作了不少工作。这说明人民是懂得并且爱护匈苏友谊的。现在匈牙利各地正在筹备庆祝十月革命四十周年。各地匈苏友协组织的活动更加活跃起来。
