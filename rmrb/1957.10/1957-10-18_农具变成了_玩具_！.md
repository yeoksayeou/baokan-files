　　Farm Tools Turned into “Toys”!
　　In Jixian County, the earliest to promote new-style animal-powered farm tools, many agricultural cooperatives do not pay enough attention to the storage of new farm tools. Seeders, harvesters, and rollers are left in the yard after use. Some agricultural cooperatives in Xing'an Township even use new farm tools as stakes for tethering livestock and building livestock pens. Due to poor storage, many new farm tools have lost parts and have had to be taken out of service. The picture above shows children from the Fengshou Cooperative in Bao'an Township playing with the front guide wheel of a disc harrow scattered outside the Jixian Tractor Station as toys.

　　农具变成了“玩具”！
    在推广新式畜力农具最早的集贤县，有不少农业社对新农具的保管工作很不重视。播种机、收割机、镇压器使完了就往院子里一放。兴安乡有的农业社还用新农具当作拴牲口、筑牲口圈的骨架子。由于保管的不好，很多新农具丢失了零件，不得不停车。上图是保安乡丰收社的孩子们把集贤拖拉机站散放在外面的圆盘耙前导轮当作玩具玩。　　　　　　　　（张志毅）（附图片）
