How to Lead a Rectification Campaign in Enterprises
The Experience of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

(Our Dispatch) The rectification campaign at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has entered the stage of great debate. Our reporter, Gu Lei, interviewed Comrade Zhang Ping, the Party Committee Secretary, on the issue of leadership in the rectification. Below is Comrade Zhang Ping's response.

Big-Character Posters are the Main Form of Extensive Airing of Views, but Not the Only Form

Question: Are big-character posters the only form of extensively airing views, or are there other forms? How did you do it?

Answer: At our plant, big-character posters are the main form of extensively airing views. However, we also adopted other forms, such as discussion meetings, letters and visits, and individual talks. We did this for two reasons: on the one hand, many workers cannot write, and although we organized many cadres to write for them, it still wasn't enough. On the other hand, some workers are unwilling or unaccustomed to using big-character posters to express their opinions, and some are unwilling to make their opinions public. Although we repeatedly mobilized them, we can never force them. In order to create every opportunity for workers to extensively air their views, we used various forms to allow the workers to express what's on their mind. In our opinion, this should also be considered an extensive airing of views.

The results have indeed been very good. For example, according to statistics as of September 21, the entire plant posted a total of 7,447 big-character posters, raising 7,356 opinions; there were 1,382 large and small discussion meetings, with 6,699 people raising 18,658 opinions. From these figures, it can be seen that if we treat big-character posters as the only form and ignore other forms, then it would not be possible for us to obtain so many opinions and we would lose a large part of the masses, which would be detrimental to the rectification campaign.

Fully Mobilizing Extensive Airing of Views and Improving Work, the Rectification Campaign is Developing Normally

Question: Everyone says that the rectification campaign at your plant is developing normally. What is your opinion?

Answer: We also estimate it that way. Based on our work experience in the previous period, we believe that the rectification campaign at our plant is normal. There are several signs of this: First, the participation in the campaign is extremely broad, and even people who rarely expressed opinions in the past are speaking up. According to statistics, more than 85% of the total number of workers have raised opinions. This shows that most people are mobilized and willing to help the Party in the rectification campaign. Second, most of the opinions raised by the workers are related to production and technical management, cadre work style, and Party-masses work, and many workers are actively participating in activities to improve work, proving that the broad masses of workers are concerned about production and the improvement of the ideological work style of cadres. Third, the vast majority of workers are well-intentioned when raising opinions. Only a very small number of opinions are biased or incorrect, which shows the workers' love for the Party. Fourth, when some anti-socialist remarks appear, many workers immediately post big-character posters to refute them. Although the scale is not large, it can be seen that the workers love the socialist cause. These have further strengthened our determination and confidence in relying on the workers to carry out the rectification.

However, at the beginning of the extensive airing of views, we had wrong ideas. After seeing some of the situations mentioned above, we felt that the masses' emotions were not normal enough. Why? Because we were influenced by the anti-rightist struggle in society, and our minds were filled with the mood of the anti-rightist struggle. We mistakenly believed that it was only normal if a large number of erroneous opinions appeared. This was the result of a lack of investigation and analysis of the workers' political thought, and it was also the result of an inadequate understanding of the Party's policy on rectification. Fortunately, this time was very short, and it was discovered and corrected by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. At this time, we quickly put all our energy into mobilizing the extensive airing of views and improving work.

Extensive Airing of Views and Improvement of Work are Carried out Together; Debate Will Not Begin Until Most of the Masses' Opinions Have Been Dealt With

Question: How do you arrange the extensive airing of views, improvement of work, and great debate?

Answer: We carry out the extensive airing of views and the improvement of work together. These two tasks cannot be separated. According to our experience in this period, after extensively airing views, the masses urgently demand that the leadership immediately improve work and change its work style. Thousands of problems are piling up on us, and it is impossible not to start improving work. Since the masses have this demand, we consider that if we can solve the problems raised by the masses in a timely manner, it will increase the masses' confidence in helping the Party in the rectification campaign, further encourage the masses' enthusiasm for extensively airing views, and raise more criticisms and suggestions. In this way, it can in turn promote the rectification and improvement work. The two influence and promote each other.

We had different views on when to start the debate, mainly the views of the leadership and the masses were inconsistent. Not long after the appearance of big-character posters, some erroneous remarks appeared, mainly regarding living welfare, and there were also individual people who made anti-socialist remarks. At this time, spontaneous debates and refutations of anti-socialist remarks had already appeared on big-character posters. A part of the masses then demanded that a debate on erroneous ideas be launched and that anti-socialist remarks be refuted. We considered this suggestion. At this time, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed us that we must never criticize the workers before the problems of the leadership have been resolved. We carefully studied this instruction and believed that it was very correct. Therefore, we decided in our work arrangements that the debate should not begin until most of the masses' opinions have been dealt with, and that spontaneous debates should not be stopped or encouraged, and that efforts should be concentrated on dealing with the masses' opinions. We did this for three reasons: one is that if the great debate is started without solving many problems, it will inevitably divert the attention of the cadres and relax the improvement of work and change of work style, which will be detrimental to the future work of the entire enterprise and to the ideological transformation of the cadres; another is that if the debate is launched without solving many problems, it will definitely dampen the enthusiasm of the workers to help the Party in the rectification campaign. They will say, "You ask us to give opinions, but you don't change them after we give them, and now you turn around and rectify us!" This approach will not be supported by the majority of workers; and another is that if the great debate is launched, the leadership cannot take care of it. At that time, we mobilized more than 1,200 cadres to work day and night to solve the problems raised by the masses, and then inserted the great debate, which would bring great difficulties to the leadership work, and would definitely relax one or focus on one, or both would not be thorough.

Now, we have dealt with more than 70% of the opinions raised by the masses. If we remove the more than 1,000 problems that need to be debated, there will be even fewer remaining problems. During this stage, the spontaneous debates on big-character posters have been increasing every day. On this basis, the conditions for launching a plant-wide great debate are relatively mature. We have had a great harvest in solving problems, and now we also have the confidence to obtain a great harvest in the great debate.

While Improving Work, Conscientiously Implement the Principle of Building the Country Through Diligence and Frugality, Mobilizing the Masses, and Making Overall Arrangements, Doing More Things and Spending Less Money

Question: What do you think we should pay special attention to when improving work?

Answer: In addition to concentrating the strength of cadres, assigning responsibility at all levels, and ensuring that every opinion is accounted for, according to our experience in our work, we must also pay special attention to implementing the principle of building the country through diligence and frugality, mobilizing the masses, and making overall arrangements. This is a very complicated issue. Among the 20,408 problems raised by the workers now, a total of 12,304 belong to production work, living welfare, and wages and rewards, and many of them require money to be spent. If there is money, it can also be spent. In the past, our plant had shortcomings in implementing the principles of building the country and running enterprises through diligence and frugality, such as a large management structure, overstaffing, and too many welfare benefits undertaken by the enterprise.

During this rectification and improvement, we called on all departments and workshops to mobilize the workers to solve problems together, and to do more things and spend less money or even no money. As a result, many things were accomplished without spending money. The mud gun team of the iron smelting department, fearing asphalt poisoning, requested that the mud milling equipment be sealed. In the past, this was a very difficult problem to solve. Later, the leadership and the workers studied together and used the "water injection" method to solve the problem without adding equipment. Because the plant reasonably adjusted the offices and rest rooms, although no houses were built, 900 workers had a place to rest. The transportation, casting, chemical, and other five workshops used the time that cadres participated in physical labor to mobilize workers to build sheds, carports, and toilets and repair roads with waste materials. Of course, we also emphasized that solving any problem must start from the situation of more than 11,000 people in the plant, and must start from the situation of millions of workers across the country, especially in terms of living welfare, wages and rewards. In the past, we did not pay attention to doing this, which brought about many problems. Today, we must never create new contradictions. If things cannot be done, we can explain them clearly to the workers. If the workers have excessive demands and cannot be explained, they can be resolved through debate, and promises must not be made lightly. The reason why we particularly emphasized the above points this time is to first establish the idea of running enterprises through diligence and frugality among cadres, and then further educate the workers. Will organize mass debates through the comparison of new and old life, workers and farmers.

Question: Please talk about how to arrange the work of the plant-wide great debate.

Answer: This work has just begun, and I'm afraid I can't say much, I can only talk about our plans and intentions.

There are a total of 1,190 large and small problems left over from the entire plant that need to be debated, the most prominent of which are living welfare, wages, rewards, and labor protection. Now the more obvious problems are: Whether housing, water and electricity, medical expenses, and other welfare undertakings should be undertaken by the state; Whether the piecework wage quota should be revised regularly, and whether the sick leave wage for piecework workers should be calculated based on the average piecework wage for the previous three months is reasonable; Whether the apprenticeship period of apprentices should be extended; What attitude should be taken towards labor protection and reward issues. We plan to start discussing specific issues first through a comparison of new and old life, workers and farmers. Organize mass debates. Then, guide the workers to recognize how the working class should fulfill its leading responsibility among all the people, the relationship between the individual and the collective and the individual and the country, the relationship between freedom and discipline, and the relationship between the working class and the peasants.

We also have a plan to solve all the remaining problems in the debate, and we must do it thoroughly. Large problems organize large debates, small problems organize small debates. In short, we must clarify the right and wrong of large and small problems. In order to have a good debate, we have paid attention to the work of cultivating backbone members. The debate methods are prepared in various ways, such as big-character posters, small group meetings, joint debate meetings, individual conversations, and organizing old workers to make typical reports. The four visiting groups we sent to the countryside a few days ago have returned, and we are preparing to have them report to everyone on the state of cooperation and peasant life. In addition, we would like to send a few more groups of young workers to visit the countryside.

    在企业中如何领导整风运动
    石景山钢铁厂取得经验
    本报讯　石景山钢铁厂的整风运动已转入大辩论阶段。本报记者顾雷就整风的领导问题访问了党委书记张萍同志。下面是张萍同志的答问。
    大字报是大鸣大放的主要形式，但不是唯一形式
    问：大字报是大鸣大放唯一的形式呢，还是有其他种形式？你们是怎样做的？
    答：在我们厂，大字报是大鸣大放的主要形式。但是，我们也采用了其他种方式。例如座谈会、来信来访、个别谈话等。我们所以这样做，有两方面原因：一方面，有许多工人不会写，尽管我们组织了许多干部去代笔，仍然不能满足他们；另一方面，有些工人不愿意或不习惯利用大字报提意见，也有的人不愿意把自己的意见公开，虽然我们曾再三动员，但绝不能勉强他们。为了给职工创造一切大鸣大放的机会，所以我们利用了多种的形式，让职工把心里的话都说出来。照我们的看法，这也应该算是大鸣大放。
    从结果看确实是很好的。例如，到9月21日的统计，全厂共贴出大字报七千四百四十七张，提出意见七千三百五十六条；大小座谈会一千三百八十二次，有六千六百九十九人提出一万八千六百五十八条意见。从这个数字可以看出，如果我们把大字报当作唯一的形式，而忽略了其他种形式，那末我们就不可能获得这样多的意见，就会失掉很大一部分群众，这是不利于整风运动的。
    全力发动大鸣大放和改进工作，整风运动发展得正常
    问：大家都说你们厂整风运动发展得正常，你的看法如何？
    答：我们也是这样估计的。根据前一个时期的工作体验，我们认为我厂的整风运动是正常的，有这样几个标志：第一，参加运动的人极为广泛，连过去很少提意见的人都说话了。据统计，提意见的人占职工总数85％以上。这说明大部分人动起来了，愿意帮助党整风。第二，工人提出的意见大部分是属于生产和技术管理、干部作风、党群工作方面的，而且有许多工人积极参加改进工作的活动，证明广大职工是关心生产、关心干部思想作风的改进的。第三，绝大部分职工在提意见时，大都是善意的。只有极少数人的意见是偏激的或错误的，这表现了工人对党的爱护。第四，当某些反社会主义的言论出现时，马上有许多工人贴大字报，进行反驳，虽然规模不大，却可以看出工人是热爱社会主义事业的。这些，更加坚定了我们依靠工人进行整风的决心和信心。
    但在开始大鸣大放的时候，我们曾经有过错误的看法。当我们看到前述一些情况以后，反而觉得群众情绪不够正常。为什么呢？是因为受了社会上反右派斗争的影响，思想上充满了反右派斗争的情绪，错认为只有大量出现错误的意见才算正常。这是缺乏对工人政治思想调查分析的结果，也是对党的整风运动方针了解不透彻的结果。好在这个时间很短，便被中共北京市委会发现纠正了。这时，我们才很快把全部精力投到发动大鸣大放和改进工作方面去。
    大鸣大放和改进工作一起进行；群众意见不大部处理完不进行辩论
    问：你们怎样安排大鸣大放、改进工作和大辩论的？
    答：大鸣大放、改进工作，我们是一起进行的。这两个工作是不能分开的。根据我们这段工作的体验，大鸣大放了，群众迫切要求领导上立即改进工作和改变作风，成千上万个问题压到我们头上来，不着手改进工作是不行的。既然群众有这种要求，我们考虑如果能及时解决群众提出的问题，会增加群众帮助党整风的信心，会进一步鼓舞群众大鸣大放的热情，会提出更多的批评和建议。这样，反过来又可以推进整改工作。两者是相互影响、相互推动的。
    在何时开始辩论这个问题上，我们这里曾有过不同的看法，主要是领导和群众的看法不一致。大字报出现不久，出现了一些错误的言论，主要是生活福利方面的，也有个别的人发表反社会主义的言论。这时自发的辩论和对反社会主义言论的反驳已在大字报上出现了。一部分群众便要求开展对错误思想的辩论和对反社会主义言论进行反驳。我们曾考虑过这个建议。这时，中共北京市委会指示我们，属于领导上的问题没有解决完之前，绝对不能批评工人。我们仔细地研究了这个指示，认为是十分正确的，于是在工作部署上确定：在大部分群众意见没有处理以前不开始辩论，对自发的辩论不制止，也不鼓励，集中力量处理群众的意见。我们所以这样做，有三个理由：一个是，如果在许多问题没有解决的情况下开始大辩论，势必转移干部的视力，放松了改进工作和改变作风，对整个企业今后的工作不利，对干部的思想改造不利；另一个，如果摆着很多问题不解决就展开辩论，一定会挫伤职工帮助党整风的积极性。他们会说：“叫我们提意见，提了你们也不改，现在反过来整我们了！”这种做法是不会得到大多数工人同情的；再一个，如果开展大辩论，领导力量也顾不过来。当时我们动员了一千二百多名干部昼夜突击解决群众提出的问题，再把大辩论插进来，会给领导工作带来很大的困难，一定会放松一个或抓紧一个，或者是两者都搞得不彻底。
    现在，我们已把群众提出的意见处理了70％以上，如果除去需要辩论的一千多个问题，剩下的问题就更少了。这个阶段内，大字报上自发的辩论每天都有增加，在这个基础上开展全厂性大辩论的条件比较成熟了。在解决问题时我们有了一个丰收，现在也有信心获得大辩论的丰收。
    在改进工作的同时贯彻执行勤俭建国、群众动手、全面安排的方针，多办事少花钱
    问：你认为在改进工作的时候，应该特别注意那些问题呢？
    答：除了集中干部力量、层层负责动手，做到条条意见有交代以外，根据我们工作中的体会，还必须特别注意贯彻勤俭建国、群众动手、全面安排的方针。这是个很复杂的问题。现在工人提出的二万零四百零八个问题中，属于生产工作、生活福利、工资奖励的共一万二千三百零四个，其中有许多是需要花钱的，如果有钱也是可以花出去的。我们厂过去在贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业方针时有缺点，如管理机构庞大、人浮于事以及由企业包下来的福利太多等。
    这次边整边改时，我们号召各科室、各车间一定要发动工人一齐动手解决问题，一定要多办事而少花钱甚至不花钱。结果，有许多事情没有花钱也办成了。炼铁部泥炮组因怕沥青中毒，曾要求把碾泥机设备密封起来，在过去这本是个很难解决的问题，后来领导上同工人一起研究，使用“打水”的方法，不增加设备就把问题解决了。由于全厂合理地调整了办公室和休息室，虽然没有盖房子，却使九百个工人有了休息的地方。运输、铸造、化工等五个车间，利用干部参加体力劳动的时间，动员工人自己动手，用废料盖了工棚、车棚、厕所，修了路。当然，我们也同时强调解决任何问题都要从全厂一万一千多人的情况出发，都要从全国千百万工人的情况出发，特别在生活福利、工资奖励方面。过去，我们没有注意这样做，曾带来了不少问题，今天绝不能再制造新的矛盾了。办不了的事，可向工人讲清楚。工人有了过高的要求，又解释不通，可通过辩论解决，万不能轻易许愿。我们这次所以特别强调上面的几点，是为的首先在干部中树立起勤俭办企业的思想，然后进一步教育工人。将通过新旧生活、工人和农民
    生活对比组织群众性大辩论
    问：请你谈谈如何安排全厂大辩论的工作。
    答：这个工作才开始，恐怕谈不出什么，只能讲讲我们的打算和意图。
    全厂遗留下来的需要辩论的大小问题，共有一千一百九十个，其中最突出的是生活福利、工资、奖励、劳保等。现在问题比较明显的有：住宅、水电、医疗费用和其他福利事业是否应由国家包下来；计件工资定额是否应定期修改，计件工人病假工资按前三个月平均计件工资计算是否合理；学徒工的学徒年限应不应该延长；用怎样的态度对待劳动保护和奖励问题。我们打算先通过新旧生活、工人和农民生活的对比开始讨论具体问题，组织群众性的大辩论。然后，引导工人认清工人阶级怎样在全体人民中尽到领导的责任、个人和集体以及个人和国家的关系、自由和纪律的关系、工人阶级和农民的关系等基本问题。
    我们还有一个打算，就是要在辩论中把所有留下来的问题全部解决，一定要搞得彻底。大问题组织大辩论，小问题组织小辩论。总之，要辩明大小问题的是非。为了辩论得好，我们注意了培养骨干分子的工作。辩论的方式准备多种多样，如大字报、小组会、联合辩论会、个别交谈、组织老工人作典型报告等等。我们前些日子派到农村去的四个访问团已经回来，准备要他们向大家报告合作化和农民生活的状况。另外，我们还想再派几批青年工人到农村去访问。
