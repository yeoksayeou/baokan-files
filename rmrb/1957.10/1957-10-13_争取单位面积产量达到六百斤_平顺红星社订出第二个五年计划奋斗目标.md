Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 11th: The Red Star Agricultural, Forestry, and Livestock Production Cooperative in Yangjingdi Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, recently formulated its Second Five-Year Plan. The total output value of the cooperative's agricultural, forestry, livestock, and sideline occupations in the First Five-Year Plan has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded by 20%.

The goals of the Second Five-Year Plan determined by the cooperative are: by 1962, to increase the unit area yield of grain from the current four hundred jin to six hundred jin; the total property value of the cooperative will reach 2.76 million yuan, an average of 13,000 yuan per household; and the annual income per household will increase from the current 480 yuan to 1,000 yuan.

The Red Star Cooperative has determined that during the Second Five-Year Plan, it will continue to comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production. In the next five years, the cooperative will devote 25,000 workdays to build farmland water conservancy projects, vigorously explore fertilizer sources, terrace fields, and promote the cultivation of high-yield crops. Through these measures, the unit area yield of grain will be increased from the current 440 jin to 600 jin. By 1962, the total grain output of the cooperative is planned to reach more than one million jin. The main measures for developing forestry are to cultivate young forests into timber, and fruit trees will also be developed from the foot of the mountain to the hillside. It is planned to expand pine and cypress forests by more than 3,000 mu, and orchards by more than 1,000 mu. By then, the cooperative's production of apples, pears, grapes, walnuts, peaches, plums, apricots, and other fruits will be greatly increased. Animal husbandry mainly focuses on developing pig and sheep production, and promoting the experience of feeding pigs with various leaves and wild vegetables. By 1962, the number of pigs raised can be increased by more than three times compared with this year, with an average of four and a half pigs per household, and sheep will increase by nearly four hundred. In terms of sideline production, in addition to continuing to develop existing sideline productions, it is also necessary to develop sideline occupations such as beekeeping, silkworm breeding, rabbit breeding, and duck raising.

The beautiful prospects of the Second Five-Year Plan have inspired the production enthusiasm of the members. The members put forward the slogan of "Focusing on the first year of the Five-Year Plan, and focusing on the three seasons for the first year's production," and decided to immediately launch a large-scale farmland water conservancy construction movement after this year's autumn harvest.

　　争取单位面积产量达到六百斤
    平顺红星社订出第二个五年计划奋斗目标
    据新华社太原11日电　山西省平顺县羊井底乡红星农林牧生产合作社最近制定了第二个五年计划。全社第一个五年计划的农林牧副业总产值已经提前超额20％完成。
    这个社确定的第二个五年计划的奋斗目标是：到1962年，把粮食的单位面积产量从今年的四百斤提高到六百斤，全社的财产总值将达到二百七十六万元，平均每户一万三千元，每户的年收入将由现在的四百八十元提高到一千元。
    红星社确定在第二个五年计划内，继续全面地发展农业、林业、牧业和副业生产。在未来的五年内，全社将以二万五千个劳动日兴修农田水利，并且大力发掘肥源，翻整梯田和推广培育高产作物，通过这些措施，把粮食的单位面积产量由今年的四百四十斤提高到六百斤，到1962年，全社的粮食总产量计划达到一百万斤以上。发展林业的主要措施是培育幼林成材，果树也将由山下向山腰发展，计划松柏林木扩大三千亩以上，果园扩大一千多亩，到那时，全社的苹果、梨、葡萄、核桃、桃、李、杏等水果的产量将大大增加。畜牧业主要是发展猪和羊的生产，推广用各种树叶、野菜喂猪经验，到1962年，猪的饲养量可以比今年增加三倍以上，平均每户养猪四口半，羊将增加近四百只。在副业生产方面，除继续发展现有各种副业生产以外，还要发展养蜂、养蚕、养兔和养鸭等副业。
    第二个五年计划的美好远景鼓舞了社员们的生产热情。社员们提出“五年计划抓头年，头年生产抓三季”的口号，决定今年秋收后立即展开一个大规模的兴修农田水利的运动。
