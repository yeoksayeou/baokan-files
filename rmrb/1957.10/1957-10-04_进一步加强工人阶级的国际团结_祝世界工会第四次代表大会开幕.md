    Further Strengthen the International Solidarity of the Working Class
    ——A Message of Congratulation on the Opening of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress
    The Fourth World Trade Union Congress begins today in Leipzig. Chinese trade union organizations wholeheartedly wish the congress success.
    This congress is convened in a context of further upsurge in the struggle of the working class worldwide and the pressing demand of the world's working class for unity.
    Since the Third World Trade Union Congress was held in 1953, the working men and women of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, have continuously achieved great successes in the process of striving to build socialism and communism, which has an increasingly profound impact on the world trade union movement. At the same time, during this period, the working class in capitalist countries has carried out large-scale strike struggles, giving a powerful counterattack to the rampant attacks of monopoly capital. Trade union organizations in nationally independent countries and countries striving for national independence are playing an increasingly important role in the struggle for and safeguarding national independence. The strengthening of mutual support among the world's working class in opposing the cruel exploitation of monopoly capital and opposing colonialism has effectively promoted the unity and unification of world trade union organizations.
    The main task of this World Trade Union Congress is to further develop friendly relations between trade union organizations and promote the unity of world trade unions. The congress will conduct friendly discussions on issues such as striving to increase wages, shorten working hours, strive for trade union rights, supporting national independence, striving for disarmament and safeguarding world peace. Such discussions will undoubtedly strengthen mutual understanding and close cooperation among world trade unions.
    We clearly see that the monopoly capitalists of the capitalist world, for their insatiable profits, are intensifying the exploitation of the working class of various countries in a manner of international alliance. In order to achieve this despicable goal, they can disregard national sovereignty and national interests. The European "Common Market" initiated by the monopoly capitalists of West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg has this extremely reactionary nature. It is worth noting that the monopoly capitalists' rampant attacks on the working class are carried out in a situation where the world trade union movement is divided. From this, it can be seen that the division of the world trade union movement is only beneficial to monopoly capitalists and extremely harmful to the working class. The struggle of the working class in various countries to achieve domestic and international unity is more urgent today than at any time. Today, although the working people of all countries in the world have differences in social systems, political views, religious beliefs, and racial skin color, they have many common interests and demands. We should promote the unity of the world's working class and the unification of the world trade union movement from the perspective of protecting these common interests.
    We also see that the spirit of the Bandung Conference has deeply taken root in people's hearts, and the great victory of the Egyptian people in resisting the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression has greatly encouraged the confidence and determination of hundreds of millions of people in Asia and Africa to fight against colonialism, pushing the world's anti-colonial movement to a new climax. The colonial system is definitely collapsing, and the forces of imperialism have been further weakened. Just as no force can stop the sun from rising, no force in the world can stop the rapid development of the national independence movement. However, the imperialists are not reconciled to their defeat. The United States imperialism, harboring the ambition to dominate the Middle East, is taking measures such as obstruction, division, subversion, and armed intervention, and is trying its best to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in this region. Currently, the United States is intensifying its aggression against Syria, attempting to overthrow the Syrian nationalist government, and clear the obstacles for its aggressive plan to enslave the people of the Middle East countries. Faced with this situation, the world's working class must further strengthen internationalist unity and mutual support in the anti-colonial struggle in order to defeat all the conspiracies and tricks of the colonialists.
    This World Trade Union Congress will be attended by representatives of trade unions from nearly one hundred countries. This is an unprecedented gathering of representatives of trade unions and workers from all over the world, and a congress to strengthen the unity and unification of world trade union organizations. It will surely make valuable contributions to further strengthening the unity and mutual support of the world's working class. At the same time, it will enable the world's working class to further play a significant role in easing international tensions and defending world peace.
    The Chinese trade union fully supports the convening of this World Trade Union Congress, and will continue to strengthen friendly ties with the working class and trade union organizations of all countries, and strive to promote the unity and unification of world trade union organizations. All the working men and women of China are following the progress of the Leipzig Congress with great enthusiasm, and firmly believe that this congress will surely successfully complete its historical task.

### 进一步加强工人阶级的国际团结——祝世界工会第四次代表大会开幕

    进一步加强工人阶级的国际团结
    ——祝世界工会第四次代表大会开幕
    世界工会第四次代表大会今天在来比锡开始举行。中国工会组织衷心地预祝这次代表大会的成功。
    这次代表大会是在全世界工人阶级斗争进一步高涨和工会的团结一致已成为全世界工人阶级的迫切要求的情况下召开的。
    自从世界工会第三次代表大会于1953年举行以来，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的男女职工，在努力建设社会主义和共产主义的进程中，不断地获得了伟大的成就，这对世界工会运动产生着愈来愈深远的影响。同时，在这一时期内，资本主义国家内的工人阶级进行了规模巨大的罢工斗争，给了垄断资本的猖狂进攻以有力的反击。民族独立国家和正在争取民族独立国家的工会组织，在争取和维护民族独立的斗争中，起着日益重要的作用。世界工人阶级在反对垄断资本的残酷剥削、反对殖民主义斗争中相互支援的加强，有效地推进着世界工会组织的团结和统一。
    这次世界工会代表大会的主要任务，就是要进一步地发展各工会组织之间的友好联系，促进世界工会的团结。这次大会将对争取提高工资、缩短工作时间、争取工会权利、支援民族独立、争取实现裁军和维护世界和平等问题，进行友好的讨论。通过这种讨论，无疑将加强世界工会之间的相互了解和密切合作。
    我们清楚地看到，资本主义世界的垄断资本家为了它们贪得无厌的利润，正在以国际联合的方式来加紧剥削各国工人阶级，它们为了达到这种卑鄙的目的，对于国家的主权和民族的利益可以置之不顾。西德、法国、意大利、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡六国的垄断资本家所发起成立的欧洲“共同市场”，就具有这种极端反动的性质。值得注意的是，垄断资本家向工人阶级的猖狂进攻，是在世界工会运动被分裂的情况下进行的。由此可见，世界工会运动的分裂只有对垄断资本家有利，对工人阶级是极端有害的。各国工人阶级争取国内和国际的团结统一，今天比任何时期都更加迫切了。今天，世界各国劳动人民尽管有社会制度、政治见解、宗教信仰和种族肤色上的不同，但是他们有着很多共同的利益和要求，我们应当从保护这些共同利益着眼，来促进世界工人阶级的团结和世界工会运动的统一。
    我们也看到，万隆会议的精神深入人心和埃及人民反抗英、法、以侵略的伟大胜利，已经大大地鼓舞了亚洲非洲亿万人民反对殖民主义斗争的信心和决心，把全世界的反对殖民主义运动推向新的高潮。殖民主义制度已肯定地在崩溃中，帝国主义的势力已被进一步削弱。像任何力量都不能阻拦住太阳的上升一样，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡民族独立运动的迅速发展。但是，帝国主义者是不甘心他们的失败的，美帝国主义怀着独霸中近东地区的野心，正在采取阻挠、分裂、颠覆、武装干涉等等手段，竭力在这一地区推行“艾森豪威尔主义”。目前美国正在加紧侵略叙利亚的活动，企图推翻叙利亚的民族主义政府，为它的奴役中近东各国人民的侵略计划扫清障碍。面临着这种局势，全世界工人阶级必须在反殖民主义斗争中进一步加强国际主义的团结和相互支援，以击败殖民主义者的一切阴谋诡计。
    这次世界工会代表大会将有近一百个国家的各派工会的代表参加，这是世界各国工会和工人的代表空前的大会师，是加强世界工会组织团结统一的大会。它必将对进一步加强世界工人阶级的团结和相互支援作出宝贵的贡献。它同时将使世界工人阶级在缓和国际紧张局势，保卫世界和平的斗争中进一步发挥重大的作用。
    中国工会完全支持这次世界工会代表大会的召开，并将继续加强与世界各国工人阶级和各工会组织的友谊联系，为促进世界工会组织的团结与统一而努力。中国全体男女职工都正以巨大的热情，关怀着来比锡大会的进行，并且坚信这次大会一定能够胜利地完成它的历史性的任务。
