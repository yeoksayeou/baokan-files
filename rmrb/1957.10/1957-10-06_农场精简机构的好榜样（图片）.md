Good Example of Streamlining Farm Organizations

    The state-run Beijing Southern Suburb Farm, based on the principles of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift, vigorously streamlined its organizations during the rectification campaign, greatly reduced the number of personnel detached from production, and changed the situation of being bloated and having excessive management expenses.

    The Southern Suburb Farm focuses on both agriculture and animal husbandry. The farm has more than 1,300 employees. The number of full-time cadres was reduced from the original 89 to 16. After the streamlining, there are fewer administrative affairs, and leading cadres can spend more time going deep among the masses and into production. After the cadres go to the fields to work, many problems can be solved at any time, and work efficiency is higher than before. This has greatly improved farm management and tempered the cadres. The whole farm has formed a style of hard work, simplicity, and thrift in running the farm, and a production upsurge of unity and labor.

    The Party branch secretary used to be detached from production, but now he also participates in labor. This is Liu Zhengang (left), the Party branch secretary of the Fourth Branch, talking to a young person during a break from labor.

    These women cadres who participated in labor after being streamlined, some of whom had studied in primary or secondary school for several years and participated in revolutionary work very early, and some of whom were college students who had not been working for long, are now beginning to temper themselves in labor.

    Personnel cadre Shi Hongbin (center) and animal husbandry technician Jiang Yuhua (right) participated in labor at the cattle farm after being streamlined. Shi Hongbin served as the deputy captain, and because Jiang Yuhua worked with the workers, many technical problems were also solved in a timely manner. This is them working together with the workers.

    After the streamlining, leading cadres went deeper among the masses and into production, and their relationship with the masses became closer. This is farm director Zhao Biao (first person on the right) inspecting work at the chicken farm.

    农场精简机构的好榜样
    地方国营北京南郊农场根据勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的原则，在整风中大力精简了机构，大大减少了脱离生产人员，改变了臃肿庞大、管理费用过高的情况。
    南郊农场经营业务以农业和畜牧业并重，全场职工有一千三百多人，脱产干部从原有的八十九人减少到十六人。精简后，行政事务少了，领导干部能抽出更多的时间深入群众、深入生产；干部下地劳动后，许多问题也能随时解决，工作效率比以前提高。这就大大改善了农场管理，锻炼了干部。全场形成了艰苦、朴素、勤俭办社的风气和团结、劳动的生产热潮。

    党支部书记过去是脱产的，现在也参加劳动了。这是四分场党支部书记刘振刚（左）在劳动间隙休息时，和一个青年群众谈话。
    这几位精简后参加劳动的妇女干部，有的是在小学或中学读了几年书后，很早就参加了革命工作的，有的是参加工作不久的大学生，现在他们开始在劳动中锻炼自己。
    人事干部史洪斌（中）和畜牧技术员姜玉华（右），精简后在牛场参加劳动。史洪斌担任了副队长，姜玉华由于和工人一起劳动，许多技术问题也及时得到解决。这是他们和工人一起工作。
    精简后，领导干部更加深入群众、深入生产，和群众关系更密切了。这是场长赵彪（右第一人）在鸡场检查工作。
