Good News from Laos
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

The communiqué of the political consultation conference between the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Forces on October 22 announced that both sides had reached an agreement on the establishment of a coalition government and on the participation of the Lao Fighting Forces personnel in national collective life. This is a major victory for the Lao people in their struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country. This is exciting good news.

Negotiations between the two sides in Laos began after the ceasefire in August 1954, in accordance with the Geneva Accords. This agreement clearly stipulated that the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Forces should seek the peaceful reunification of the country through consultation. Since then, more than three years have passed. The Lao people have waged a persistent struggle to achieve this lofty aspiration. It should be said that the process of this struggle has been complex and tortuous; however, the Lao people have finally overcome various difficulties and obstacles, enabling the negotiations to gradually progress. Especially since the establishment of the Lao government headed by Souvanna Phouma in early 1956, contact and consultation between the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Forces have increased compared to the past. During the period from November 6 to December 23, 1956, Prince Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong reached three important agreements in Vientiane: an agreement on the cessation of hostilities, an agreement on a policy of peace and neutrality, and an agreement on guaranteeing the civil rights of members of the Lao Fighting Forces and its supporters. In order to implement these agreements, the two princes signed a joint communiqué on December 28, 1956, stipulating that the current Royal Government be reorganized into a coalition government including personnel from the Lao Fighting Forces. Now, thanks to the continued efforts of both sides, the negotiations have taken a big step forward. The agreement announced by both parties on October 22 will be a memorable event in Lao history. The national reunification that the Lao people have been looking forward to for many years is about to be realized.

The major achievements of the negotiations between the two sides in Laos were achieved in the absence of foreign interference. In recent years, the United States has continuously interfered in Lao internal affairs, attempting to place Laos completely under its control. In order to achieve this colonialist goal, the United States has consistently obstructed the realization of national reunification in Laos. On April 16 this year, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France sent a note to the Lao Royal Government, urging it to reject the reasonable demands put forward by the Lao Fighting Forces. On June 13, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson publicly opposed the establishment of a coalition government in Laos that included personnel from the Lao Fighting Forces. According to foreign news agencies, the U.S. ambassador who recently returned to Vientiane is stepping up planning sabotage activities. However, the Lao people's firm will to establish a coalition government and achieve peaceful national reunification cannot be resisted by any force.

The full implementation of these agreements will mark the beginning of a new life for the Lao people. It will greatly benefit the unity of the people throughout the country, consolidate national independence, and build their own country in a peaceful and stable environment. At the same time, the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos is also an important contribution to maintaining peace in Indochina and Asia as a whole.

As neighbors and friends of the Lao people, the people of our country sincerely welcome the achievements made by the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Forces, and warmly congratulate the Lao people on their major victory. We believe that although those who do not want to see the peaceful reunification of Laos will carry out sabotage activities, the future of Laos is full of hope; although the Lao people will encounter various difficulties, Laos will surely continue to advance along the road of independence, peace, unity, and prosperity.

    老挝的喜讯
    本报评论员
    10月22日，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方政治协商会议的公报宣布，双方已就关于成立联合政府和关于寮国战斗部队人员参加国家集体生活的问题达成协议。这是老挝人民争取祖国和平统一的重大胜利。这是一个令人兴奋的喜讯。
    老挝双方的谈判，是在1954年8月依照日内瓦协议实行停火以后开始的。这个协议明确规定了老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队应该通过协商谋求国家的和平统一。从那以后，三年多的时间过去了。老挝人民为了实现这个崇高的愿望，进行了坚持不懈的斗争。应该说，这个斗争的过程是复杂和曲折的；但是老挝人民终于不断突破了种种困难和阻力，使这个谈判逐步获得进展。特别是从1956年初以梭发那·富马为首的老挝政府成立以后，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方的接触和协商比过去增多了。在1956年11月6日至12月23日期间，富马亲王和苏发努冯亲王在万象达成了三项重要协议：关于停止敌对行动的协议，关于和平中立政策的协议，关于保障寮国战斗部队的成员和它的支持者的公民权利的协议。为了实现这些协议，两位亲王又于1956年12月28日签署了一项联合公报，规定把现在的王国政府改组为包括寮国战斗部队人员在内的联合政府。现在，由于双方的继续努力，终于使谈判又向前进了一大步。10月22日宣布双方达成的协议，将是老挝历史上的一个值得纪念的事件。老挝人民多少年来盼望着的国家统一的局面快要实现了。
    老挝双方谈判的重大成就，是在排除外来干涉的情况下取得的。这几年以来，美国不断地干涉老挝内政，企图把老挝完全置于它的支配之下。为了达到这种殖民主义的目的，美国一贯阻挠老挝实现国家的统一。今年4月16日，美英法三国政府就曾照会老挝王国政府，怂恿它拒绝寮国战斗部队提出的合理要求。6月13日，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊更公开反对老挝成立包括寮国战斗部队人员在内的联合政府。据外国通讯社报道，最近回到万象的美国大使正在加紧策划破坏活动。但是，老挝人民要求成立联合政府、实现国家的和平统一的坚决意志，不是任何势力所能抗拒的。
    这些协议的完全实施，将标志着老挝人民的新生活的开始。它将大大有利于团结全国人民，巩固民族独立，并且在和平与稳定的环境中来建设自己的国家。同时，日内瓦协议在老挝的实现，对于维护整个印度支那以及亚洲的和平，也是一个重要的贡献。
    作为老挝人民的邻居和朋友，我国人民真诚欢迎老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方取得的成就，并热烈祝贺老挝人民取得的重大胜利。我们相信，尽管那些不愿意看到老挝和平统一的人们还会进行破坏，但是老挝的前途是充满着希望的；尽管老挝人民还会遇到种种困难，但是老挝一定将沿着独立、和平、统一、繁荣的道路继续前进。
