    Celebrating the Glorious Eight Years of the Great Motherland
    Bainqen Erdini

    The National Day of 1957 has arrived. The entire monastic and lay population of Tibet, together with the people of the whole country, are enthusiastically celebrating the glorious achievements of our great motherland over the past eight years with incomparable joy.

    Over the past eight years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have achieved national independence and unification, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, strengthened unity among all ethnic groups, and achieved great victories in political, economic, and cultural construction. Especially on the basis of completing a series of socialist transformations, industrial construction and agricultural production have achieved rapid development. This has fundamentally changed the economic face of our society and unprecedentedly improved the material and cultural lives of the people. However, bourgeois right-wingers have disregarded these achievements, exaggerated shortcomings, undermined national unity, and attempted to usurp the leadership of the Communist Party, obstructing the victorious progress of our country's socialist construction. We, the Tibetan people, are extremely resentful of these criminal activities of the bourgeois right-wingers. We will, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely repel the frenzied attacks of the right-wingers and defend our socialist cause.

    Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, with the vigorous support and assistance of all fraternal ethnic groups across the country, and under the direct leadership of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC, and through the joint efforts of the Tibetan people, the People's Liberation Army, and Han cadres, Tibet's work in all aspects has achieved great success. The unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within Tibet has been increasingly strengthened. The patriotic enthusiasm of the Tibetan people has also been continuously enhanced. The frontier of the motherland has become increasingly consolidated. In short, under the common goal of unity and progress, Tibet's political, economic, and cultural undertakings have made certain progress. For example, there was no industry in Tibetan history, but in the few years since liberation, hydroelectric power plants, thermal power plants, automobile repair factories, iron factories, and open-pit coal mines have appeared in various parts of Tibet. Banks, trading companies, post and telecommunications bureaus, people's hospitals, health clinics, and veterinary prevention and treatment stations have appeared in various important towns. The children of the Tibetan people can study in middle schools, primary schools, various cadre schools, and training classes in their own region, and a large number of ethnic cadres have the opportunity to pursue advanced studies in the interior. The broad masses of the people have received a large amount of interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans and relief funds from the Central People's Government, which has helped all walks of life in Tibet. In particular, the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways and the Lhasa-Beijing air route has made the connection between Tibet and the interior even closer. A network of highways extending in all directions has appeared on the vast Tibetan plateau, promoting the exchange of goods between agricultural areas, pastoral areas, and handicraft cities in Tibet. At present, the Qingzang Railway is also under survey. These series of concrete facts fully prove the correctness of the leadership and ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party, and prove that the socialist road is the only correct road for the Tibetan people.

    The great Chinese Communist Party has opposed national oppression and advocated national equality since its birth, and has striven to achieve the liberation of all mankind and the common development and prosperity of all ethnic groups. The Communist Party's ethnic policy is the policy for the complete liberation of all minority ethnic groups in our country. The socialist road is the road to the development and prosperity of all ethnic groups. Any ethnic group that wants to reach socialist society must go through the road of reform (including democratic reform and social reform). Because only after establishing a socialist political and economic system through reform can we thoroughly liberate the productive forces and open up broad avenues for economic and cultural development. Therefore, it is beyond doubt that Tibet, like other ethnic minority areas, will gradually implement social reform and enter socialist society. We can recall the past history and compare the situation in Tibet when it was ruled by imperialism and successive reactionary governments with the situation in Tibet after liberation today. It will naturally be clear who is good and who is bad. We should eliminate worries, broaden our horizons, and not only look at the individual shortcomings of reform in a certain place, but should look at the great achievements made by various fraternal ethnic minority areas after reform. Furthermore, we must not easily believe the instigation of reactionary elements and be hesitant to resist reform. We know that Tibet is an inseparable part of the motherland's territory, and the Tibetan people are one of the fraternal ethnic groups in the great family of the motherland. The subversive activities and secessionist conspiracies of imperialism and splittist elements are doomed to shameful failure. Tibet must carry out democratic reform and resolutely take the socialist road.

    However, judging from the current actual situation in Tibet, the conditions for reform are not yet mature. More specifically, only a few people in the upper echelons of Tibet support it, most people still have varying degrees of doubt, and in fact do not support it. A small number of the masses do have active demands for reform, but most of the masses still lack these active demands. Therefore, the central government's policy of not reforming the Tibetan region for six years is correct and of positive significance.

    However, although there will be no reform in the six years, our work in all aspects cannot be relaxed. The upper echelons and religious circles of all strata in Tibet should understand and care for the suffering of the working people, and create conditions in all aspects to realize reform as soon as possible. Therefore, we should more closely unite under the banner of the great Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, further consolidate unity, strengthen practical actions of anti-imperialism and patriotism, and be vigilant against the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and reactionary elements. We also hope that a few individuals who have gone astray will pull back from the brink. For the thorough liberation of our ethnic group and for building a happy homeland, let us join hands, work together, and conscientiously follow the instructions of the central government and Chairman Mao. Obey the resolutions of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, thoroughly implement the Peaceful Liberation Agreement, and strive to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

    庆祝伟大祖国光辉的八年
    班禅额尔德尼
    1957年的国庆节到了，西藏全体僧俗人民和全国人民一道，以无比欢乐的心情热烈庆祝我们伟大祖国成立八年来的辉煌成就。
    八年来，我国各族人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的英明领导下，实现了国家的独立和统一，巩固了人民民主专政，加强了各民族间的团结，同时在政治经济和文化建设事业上都取得了巨大的胜利。尤其在完成一系列社会主义改造的基础上，工业建设和农业生产都得到了突飞猛进的发展。这就使我国社会的经济面貌发生了根本变化，人民物质和文化生活得到空前的提高。但是资产阶级右派分子无视这些成绩，夸大缺点，并破坏民族团结，企图篡夺共产党的领导，阻碍我国社会主义建设事业胜利的进行。我们西藏人民对资产阶级右派分子的这些罪恶活动十分愤恨，我们要与全国人民一道，坚决打退右派分子的猖狂进攻，保卫我们社会主义事业。
    西藏和平解放以来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导下，在全国各兄弟民族的大力支援帮助下，在西藏自治区筹备委员会和中共西藏工委的直接领导下，在西藏人民与人民解放军和汉族干部共同努力下，西藏各方面的工作，均获得了巨大的成就。汉藏民族之间和西藏内部的团结日益加强。西藏人民的爱国热情也不断地提高。祖国的边疆也日益巩固。总之，在团结进步的同一目标下，西藏的政治、经济、文化等事业都有了一定的发展。例如在西藏历史上从未有什么工业，但在解放后的几年中，在西藏各地出现了水电厂、火力发电厂、汽车修配厂、铁工厂和露天煤矿等建设。在各个重要城镇出现了银行、贸易公司、邮电局、人民医院、卫生所和兽医防治所。西藏人民的子弟能到本区的中学小学、各种干部学校和训练班学习，大批民族干部有机会到内地深造。广大人民得到了中央人民政府大量的无息农牧贷款、救济款，使西藏的各行各业都得到了扶助。特别是康藏、青藏公路的通车和拉萨—北京航线的通航，使西藏与内地的联系更加紧密了。在辽阔的西藏高原上，出现了四通八达的公路交通网，促进了西藏农业区、牧区和手工业城市间的物资交流。目前青藏铁路也正在勘测中，通过这一系列的具体事实，充分地证明了中国共产党的领导和民族政策的正确，证明了社会主义道路是西藏人民唯一正确的道路。
    伟大的中国共产党从它诞生之日起就反对民族压迫，主张民族平等，为达到全人类的解放和各民族的共同发展繁荣而奋斗。共产党的民族政策就是我国各少数民族获得彻底解放的政策。社会主义道路就是各民族发展和繁荣的道路。任何一个民族要到社会主义社会都必须经过改革的道路（包括民主改革和社会改革）。因为只有经过改革建立起社会主义政治制度和经济制度，才能彻底解放生产力，才能为经济和文化的发展开辟广阔的道路。因此西藏地方和其他各民族地区一样，逐步实行社会改革进入社会主义社会，是无可怀疑的。我们可以回忆一下过去的历史，把帝国主义和历代反动政府统治西藏时的情况和今天解放后西藏的情况对比一下，谁好谁坏，自然就会清楚的，我们更应该消除顾虑，扩大眼界，不要只看某一个地方改革中的个别缺点，而应该看各兄弟民族地区在改革后所取得的巨大成就，更不要轻信反动分子的煽动，对改革有所疑虑而进行抗拒。我们知道，西藏是祖国领土不可分割的一部分，西藏藏族人民是祖国大家庭中的兄弟民族之一，帝国主义和分裂分子的颠覆活动和分裂的阴谋都一定要遭到可耻的失败。西藏必须进行民主改革，坚决走社会主义的道路。
    但是根据西藏现在的实际情况来看，改革条件尚不成熟，更具体地说，西藏上层人士中只有少数人是赞成的，多数人还存在着不同程度的疑虑，实际上是不赞成的，少数群众对改革确有积极的要求，但是多数群众还缺乏这积极要求。因此中央对西藏地区确定六年不改的方针是正确的具有积极意义的。
    不过，在六年内虽然不改，但我们的各项工作都不能放松，西藏各阶层的上层人士和宗教界都应该体谅和关怀劳动人民的疾苦，从各方面创造条件，以便早日实现改革。所以我们更应紧密地团结在伟大的中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的旗帜下，进一步巩固团结，加强反帝爱国的实际行动，警惕帝国主义和反动分子的阴谋诡计，我们也希望走上歧途的个别人悬崖勒马，为了本民族的彻底解放，为了建设幸福的家乡，我们携起手来，同心协力，认真地遵照中央和毛主席的指示。服从中共西藏工委和西藏自治区筹委会的各项决议，彻底执行和平协议，为建设繁荣幸福的新西藏而奋斗。
