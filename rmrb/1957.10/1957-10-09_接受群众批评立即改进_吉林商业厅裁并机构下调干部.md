    Accepting Mass Criticism and Immediately Improving:
    Jilin Commercial Department Cuts and Merges Institutions, Transfers Cadres Downward

    (Our Reporter Tang Baoshun) Jilin Province’s Commercial Department closely integrates the rectification campaign with improvement work in its fourteen directly subordinate units, including the department stores, trade, hardware, petroleum, and textile companies. During the period of great airing of views and debates, employees spoke their minds freely, raising over 1,300 suggestions. Improvement work was carried out with speed and efficiency, and more than 1,070 suggestions have already been resolved. Over 200 suggestions are still under study for improvement.

    The employees' opinions on the commercial system are multifaceted. However, the most frequent are concerns about the complexity of commercial institutions, the excessive number of non-productive personnel, the bureaucratic style of leading cadres, insufficient concern for the welfare of employees, and poor political and ideological education for employees. These opinions have drawn great attention from the Party and government leaders of various units. In addition to conducting self-criticism at general meetings, investigation and research groups were established. Problems that could be solved were resolved immediately; problems that could not be solved were explained to employees in detail, ensuring that "every matter has a result, and every issue receives a response," which greatly satisfied the employees. Based on the suggestions of the masses, the Jilin Provincial Commercial Department has merged eleven specialized industrial product companies into seven companies; the food, special products, aquatic products, and vegetable companies have been abolished and service bureaus established; the provincial trade company has been abolished, and a national trade management office has been established within the department. The Provincial Commercial Department has also abolished section-affiliated offices and adopted a two-tier system. This not only overcomes the shortcomings of overlapping institutions and business "collisions" in the past but also reduces a large number of personnel and strengthens grassroots leadership. For example, the original eleven daily-use industrial product companies had 1,086 employees; after the reorganization, this was reduced by 405 people, of whom more than 130 were sent down to city and county grassroots units. Many people directly participated in production. For example, of the 55 people sent to the Changchun Meat and Egg Processing Factory, 18 became workers; after abolishing the Provincial Trade Bureau and establishing the Trade Management Office, the number of personnel was reduced from the original 103 to over 20. This not only did not affect the work but also made it easier for leading cadres to get closer to the masses and delve into reality.

    In order to overcome the bureaucratic style of the commercial system, leaders of various units have begun to pay attention to going deep into the grassroots to understand the situation and inspect work. Leading cadres of the textile, petroleum, and other companies rarely went deep into the workshops to approach workers in the past, but now they have changed. When they have time, they can also visit workers' homes, which makes the workers feel very warm. The Provincial Department Store Company rarely went to city and county companies to inspect work in the past, but now it has also begun to change. For example, it recently sent a work team to the most remote Changbai County to inspect work and help the county department store company make commodity circulation plans and commodity organization, and in one instance, it cleared out more than 30,000 yuan of stockpiled materials. Work teams were also sent to factories to introduce customers' requirements for product quality, specifications, and prices, reversing the disharmony between industry and commerce departments.

### 接受群众批评立即改进  吉林商业厅裁并机构下调干部

    接受群众批评立即改进
    吉林商业厅裁并机构下调干部
    本报讯　记者汤宝顺报道：吉林省商业厅直属百货、贸易、五金、石油、纺织品公司等十四个单位整风与改进工作紧密结合。在大鸣大放中，职工们畅所欲言，共提出了一千三百多条意见。改进工作时，雷厉风行，现在已经解决了一千零七十多条意见。尚有二百多件，正在研究改进中。
    职工们对商业系统的意见是多方面的。但是，最多的是商业机构庞杂、脱产人员过多、领导干部存在官僚主义作风、对职工生活福利关心不够、对职工政治思想教育差等方面的意见。这些意见引起各单位的党、政领导同志极大重视。除在大会上进行检查以外，还成立了调查研究小组。能够解决的问题马上解决；不能够解决的问题也及时向职工做了具体交代，做到了“事事有结果、件件有回音”，职工群众很满意。根据群众的意见，吉林省商业厅已经将十一个日用工业品专业公司改并七个公司；撤销了食品、专卖、水产、蔬菜等公司，设立了服务局；撤销了省贸易公司，在厅内设立了民族贸易管理处。省商业厅还取消了处属科，改为两级制。这样，不仅克服了过去机构重叠，业务“碰车”等缺点，也减少了大批人员，加强了基层领导。如十一个日用工业品公司原来工作人员一千零八十六人；整编后就减下来四百零五人，其中有一百三十多人下派到市、县基层单位。许多人并直接参加了生产。如派到长春市肉类蛋品加工厂的五十五人中，就有十八人当了工人；撤销省贸易局设立贸易管理处以后，由原来的一百零三人，减少到二十多人。这样工作不但没有受到影响，反而便于领导干部接近群众、深入实际了。
    为克服商业系统的官僚主义作风，各单位的领导人开始注意深入基层了解情况，检查工作。纺织品、石油等公司的领导干部过去很少深入车间接近工人，现在也改变了。有时间还能够到工人家中去访问，工人感到很大温暖。省百货公司常年很少到市、县公司去检查工作，现在也开始改变了。如最近派出工作组到最偏僻的长白县去检查工作，帮助县百货公司作出商品流转计划、商品站队，一次就清查出三万多元被积压的物资。还派工作组主动到工厂去介绍顾客对产品质量、规格、价格等要求，扭转了工、商部门之间不协调的现象。
