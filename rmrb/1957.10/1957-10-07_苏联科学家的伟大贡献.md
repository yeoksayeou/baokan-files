    The Great Contribution of Soviet Scientists
    Zhao Jiuzhang, Director of the Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    In a short period of preparation, Soviet scientists fully utilized the new achievements of modern science and successfully launched the first artificial satellite. This not only demonstrates once again the remarkable scientific achievements under the superior socialist system, but also marks the beginning of a new scientific era.
    Geophysicists and astronomers have long wanted to explore the physical state and chemical composition of the upper atmosphere, but we generally can only indirectly infer it through radio waves and high-altitude optical phenomena. In the past decade, although the Soviet Union, the United States, and many other countries have successfully used rockets to explore the upper atmosphere below 400 kilometers, this method can only understand the vertical structure of the upper atmosphere and cannot detect the spatial distribution and temporal changes of the physical state and chemical composition of the upper atmosphere. The launch of artificial satellites can not only meet our needs in this regard, but also provide valuable scientific materials for our research on the shape of the earth, the internal structure of the earth, and outer space for various research purposes. The following are some of the most important experimental works carried out using artificial satellites.
    First, from ground observations, the following data can be obtained: 1. The density of the upper atmosphere. Currently, we do not know the density of the atmosphere at an altitude of 900 kilometers. The density of the atmosphere can be calculated using the geometric shape of the artificial satellite's trajectory. 2. The structure of the earth's crust. Due to the uneven distribution of the density of the earth's crust, small oscillations will occur in the elliptical orbit of the artificial satellite during its operation. Precise observations can detect these small oscillations, thereby calculating the distribution of the earth's mass. 3. Geodetic surveying. The precise measurement of the trajectory of artificial satellites can also measure the shape of the earth. Synchronous observations in two locations can also accurately determine longitude and latitude. 4. Research on the ionosphere. Radio waves emitted from artificial satellites will be refracted when passing through the ionosphere. The characteristics of the vertical distribution of electrons in the ionosphere can be calculated from the observation and research of radio wave refraction.
    Second, experimental work on artificial satellites: 1. Measurement of ultraviolet light. By measuring short-wave ultraviolet light, we can understand the intensity of ultraviolet light emitted from the sun. 2. Measurement of the upper-level geomagnetic field. The geomagnetic field has two parts: the magnetic field generated by the earth changes slowly; the magnetic field generated by the movement of electrons in the upper atmosphere changes quickly. Using the device for measuring geomagnetism on artificial satellites, the distribution and changes of geomagnetism can be measured in a wide space. Sudden and huge changes in the geomagnetic field are commonly called magnetic storms, which can interfere with radio transmission. Using the measurement of the geomagnetic field on artificial satellites, we can find the cause of magnetic storms, which undoubtedly has great significance for practical applications. 3. Cosmic ray observation. The source of cosmic rays is still unclear. At the same time, due to the absorption of the atmosphere, it is difficult for us to measure the characteristics of cosmic rays on the ground. Installing a Geiger counter on an artificial satellite can measure the intensity of cosmic rays. Because artificial satellites quickly operate within a wide range of latitude and altitude, we can use it to obtain long-term records of cosmic rays, which is very meaningful for the study of cosmic rays. 4. Television can also be installed on artificial satellites to continuously photograph the changing situation of cloud cover on the earth, which also provides a valuable material for weather forecasting.
    The launch of artificial satellites is the first step for mankind to travel to the stars and conquer outer space. I warmly congratulate Soviet scientists on this great success.

    苏联科学家的伟大贡献
    中国科学院地球物理研究所所长　赵九章
    苏联科学家在不长的准备时间内，充分运用了现代科学的新成就，成功地发射出第一颗人造卫星，这不仅是又一次显示出在优越的社会主义制度下科学的卓越成就，同时也标志着一个科学新纪元的开始。
    地球物理学家及天文学家很早就想探测高层大气的物理状态及化学成分了，但是我们一般只能借助于无线电波及高空的光学现象来间接地推测它。最近十年以来，苏联、美国及许多国家，虽然成功的利用了火箭来探测四百公里以下的高层大气，但是这种方法，只能了解高层大气在垂直方向的结构，还不能探测到高层大气物理状态及化学成分的空间分布及时间的变化。人造卫星的发射，不仅能满足我们在这方面的要求，同时还对于我们研究地球形状，地球内部构造以及宇宙空间提供了有价值的科学材料，作各方面研究之用。下面是利用人造卫星所进行的几项最主要的试验工作。
    第一，从地面观测，可以得到下列资料：一、高层大气的密度。目前我们还不知道在九百公里高空大气的密度，利用人造卫星轨迹几何形状，可计算出大气的密度。二、地壳的构造。由于地壳密度分布的不均匀，人造卫星在它运行的椭圆轨道中，将发生小的摆动，精确的观测可以发觉这些小的摆动，从而推算出来地球质量的分布。三、大地测量。人造卫星轨迹的精密测量，还可以测出地球的形状。两地方同步观测还可以精确地测定经度及纬度。四、电离层的研究。从人造卫星放射出来的无线电波，在通过电离层时，将发生折射，由电波折射的观测研究可以计算出电离层电子垂直分布的特征。
    第二，人造卫星上的实验工作：一、紫外光线的测量。通过短波紫外线的测量，可以了解从太阳放射出来的紫外线的强度。二、高层地磁场的测量。地磁场有两部，由于地球而产生的磁场变化较慢；由于高层大气中电子运动而产生的磁场变化较快，利用人造卫星上测量地磁的装置，可以在广阔的空间内测得地磁的分布及变化。地磁场突然的巨大变化，普通称作磁暴，它可以干扰无线电的传递，利用人造卫星上地磁场的测量可以找到磁暴产生的原因，这无疑对于实际应用有巨大的意义。三、宇宙线观测。宇宙线的来源到现在还不很清楚，同时由于大气层的吸收，我们也难以在地面上测出宇宙线的特征。在人造卫星上安装盖氏计数器，可以把宇宙线的强度测量出来。由于人造卫星很快地在广阔的纬度及高度范围内运行，利用它我们可以得到长时期的宇宙线记载，这对于宇宙线的研究是很有意义的。四、人造卫星上还可以安装电视，连续拍摄地球上云层复盖的变化情况，这对于天气预报也提供了一项极有价值的材料。
    人造卫星的发射是人类走向星际旅行，征服宇宙空间的第一步。我热烈地祝贺苏联科学家这一伟大的成功。
