Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 27th: Shaanxi Province recently plans to transfer over 60,000 cadres to the grassroots and to the labor front, the vast majority of whom will go to the countryside and mountains to participate in labor production. The average number of cadres throughout the province will be reduced by 26% to 30%. The provincial party and government organs and enterprises and institutions alone will cut and merge more than one hundred large and small units. This is stipulated in the new plan for streamlining institutions and transferring personnel recently formulated by Shaanxi Province. At present, some cadres have already gone to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.

The rectification campaign in most organs in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City has recently entered a stage focused on rectification and improvement. The broad masses of cadres have raised hundreds of criticisms about the bloated institutions and overstaffing of various organs. At the commissioner and county head conference held in mid-October, Yang Yuting, Deputy Governor of Shaanxi Province, made a report on streamlining institutions, and the conference discussed this issue. The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee conveyed the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the broad masses of cadres, and organized cadres to study the People's Daily editorial "Go to the Countryside, Go to the Labor Front," so that everyone clearly recognized that streamlining institutions and transferring personnel is a major measure to improve work in the current rectification campaign in Shaanxi Province. Therefore, the rectification leading groups of various units have recently formulated plans for streamlining their units based on the opinions of the masses.

When formulating these plans, all units mobilized the masses to carry out full discussions. The Provincial Department of Finance, the Taxation Bureau, and the Provincial Insurance Company, among others, adopted the method of "laying out business and calculating detailed accounts" to mobilize the masses to study the issue of streamlining institutions. As a result, the streamlining ratios proposed by the masses were higher than the original plans. The original staffing plan proposed by the Shaanxi Provincial Construction Bank was one hundred people, and some leaders even felt it was too tight. After discussion by the masses, it was considered that eighty people would be enough. The Provincial Grain Bureau and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative originally proposed plans to reduce personnel by 25.74% and 28% respectively. After several discussions by the masses, the streamlining targets were both raised to over 30%.

After conscientiously studying the People's Daily editorial and listening to the mobilization report, the broad masses of cadres have improved their understanding of the great significance of building socialist agriculture. More than 2,000 cadres from the Provincial Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, the Animal Husbandry Bureau, and other units have signed up to return to the labor front. Cadres from the Provincial Grain Bureau, the Department of Finance, the Taxation Bureau, and the Equine Glanders Prevention and Treatment Team affiliated with the Department of Agriculture, among others, posted more than 500 big-character posters in the name of collectives or individuals, requesting to go to the countryside for production. Organs such as the Department of Finance have already conducted public discussions on cadres who have signed up to return to production, with the department or office as the unit. Among the cadres requesting to go to the countryside for production, there are young students who have not been working for long, university graduates who have been working in organs, and many cadres who were originally from peasant backgrounds or worked in rural areas. Most of the more than 30 cadres of the Equine Glanders Prevention and Treatment Team affiliated with the Department of Agriculture used to work in rural areas. Recently, they returned to the countryside to participate in labor production and carry out livestock disease prevention and control work in agricultural cooperatives. Li Dinghua, who originally worked in the countryside, returned to his hometown of Huaxian to participate in production, and also used the subsidy given to him by the organ to buy a breeding pig to help the agricultural cooperative develop pig farming.

### 多数参加劳动　少数充实基层  陕西下放干部将达六万多名  全省人员编制要紧缩百分之二十六以上

    多数参加劳动　少数充实基层
    陕西下放干部将达六万多名
    全省人员编制要紧缩百分之二十六以上
    新华社西安27日电　陕西省最近将抽调六万多名干部下放基层和到劳动战线上去，其中绝大部分要下乡、上山参加劳动生产。全省的干部平均将减少26％到30％。仅省级党政机关和企业、事业部门，就将裁减、合并一百多个大小单位，这是陕西省最近制订的紧缩机构、下放人员的新方案规定的。目前，有一部分干部已经下乡参加了农业生产。
    陕西省和西安市大部分机关的整风运动最近已转入着重整改阶段，广大干部对各机关机构臃肿、人浮于事的现象提出了数百条批评意见。在10月中旬召开的专员县长会议上，陕西省副省长杨玉亭作了紧缩机构的报告，会议对这一问题进行了讨论。中共陕西省委又向广大干部传达了中共八届三中全会的精神，并组织干部学习了人民日报“到农村去，到劳动战线上去”的社论，使大家明确认识到紧缩机构、下放人员是目前陕西省整风中改进工作的一项重大措施。因此，各单位的整风领导小组最近都根据群众的意见，制定了本单位紧缩机构的方案。
    各单位在制订这些方案时，都发动群众展开充分讨论，省财政厅、税务局和省保险公司等单位采取“摆业务、算细账”的办法发动群众研究紧缩机构问题，结果群众提出的方案中的紧缩比例都高于原订方案。陕西省建设银行原来提出的编制方案是一百人，一些领导人还觉得偏紧，经过群众讨论后，认为八十人就够了。省粮食厅和省供销社原来提出分别紧缩人员25.74％和28％的方案，经群众数次讨论后，紧缩指标都提高到30％以上。
    在认真学习人民日报社论和听了动员报告后，广大干部对建设社会主义农业的重大意义的认识已有提高。省商业厅、农业厅、畜牧局等单位已有两千多名干部报名要求回到劳动战线上去。省粮食厅、财政厅、税务局和农业厅所属的马鼻疽防治队等单位的干部，以集体或个人名义贴出了五百多张大字报要求下乡生产。财政厅等机关已经对报名要求回到生产中去的干部以科室为单位进行了公议。在要求下乡生产的干部中，有参加工作不久的青年学生、一直在机关工作的大学毕业生，也有不少原来是农民出身或在农村工作过的干部。农业厅所属马鼻疽防治队的三十多名干部，过去大部分在农村工作，最近又回到农村参加劳动生产和在农业社进行牲畜病疫的防治工作。原来就在农村工作的李定华回到原籍华县参加生产后，还把机关给他的补助金买了一头种猪，帮助农业社发展生猪。
