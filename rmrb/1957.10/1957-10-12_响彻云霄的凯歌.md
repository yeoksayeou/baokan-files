　　Triumphant Song Resounding Through the Clouds

    The rhythmic signal of the artificial satellite comes from the radio. It reminds one of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Now, people all over the world are listening to this new Moonlight Sonata created by Soviet scientists, and they are cheering for mankind opening the door to conquer the universe.
    Launching the first artificial satellite into the sky! This is a peaceful competition between socialist and capitalist countries over the past few years. In this historic competition, the Soviet Union has won. It is as if the red star on the Kremlin suddenly rose into the high sky, flying over Asia, flying over Europe, flying over Washington in the United States...
    The Soviet Union was silent, but it came to the front; the United States boasted a lot, but it fell behind instead. Several years ago, the United States began to promote its artificial satellite. The US government successively published artificial satellite plans with various names, and pictures of artificial satellites often appeared in American newspapers. On January 13, 1956, the United Press International reported complacently: "The United States is now competing with Russia to launch the first satellite orbiting the earth, and the United States hopes to put its bird into outer space before September 30, 1957." However, to this day, the US artificial satellite still remains on newspapers, in model exhibitions, and on the ground.
    In order to save the reputation of the United States, President Eisenhower recently came out to speak. He said: "We have never regarded the satellite program as a competition with other countries." Former Secretary of Defense Wilson, who just resigned, seemed to be smarter than the president. He said that the United States was not prepared to compete with the Soviet Union in "scientific development." However, no matter how they use spiritual victory to comfort themselves, they have no way to deny that the United States has fallen behind. Senator Jackson admitted that the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite was "a devastating blow to the scientific, industrial, and technological reputation of the United States." Another Senator, Symington, asked Congress to investigate why the United States was lagging behind the Soviet Union.
    Indeed, why is the United States lagging behind the Soviet Union? This is a very profound question. However, it would be too naive to expect the members of the US Congress to find an answer to this question. If the US Congress discusses this issue, it will only mean that new battles will unfold between various monopoly capital groups. The Associated Press reported long ago that in the manufacture of artificial satellites, "there is a lot of friction between government departments." "The New York American Journal" also revealed about the "quarrels between various military services." The monopoly capitalists represented by the US Congress and the government have never really cared about the development of science, but only cared about how to seize more profits from government contracts. They have never cared about the issue of mankind conquering outer space, but only cared about how to conquer the competitors of their small group in order to carry out greater monopoly.
    Under the capitalist system, not only labor becomes a commodity, scientific talent becomes a commodity, but even scientific work itself is only regarded as a "way to make money." Here, just as in other social fields of capitalism, there is only a struggle of vying with each other.
    It is said that the rocket engine of the artificial satellite planned by the United States is also composed of three stages. However, such a complete rocket engine is not manufactured by a unified enterprise, but by three! General Electric manufactures the first stage, General Jet Aircraft Company manufactures the second stage, and Large Central Rocket Company manufactures the third stage. This is the result of mutual competition between monopoly capital groups.
    In the manufacture of artificial satellites, the monopoly capital group represented by the Department of the Army did not grab many orders. Therefore, according to the Associated Press, recently "supporters of the Army" came out to say sarcastic remarks. They boasted: "If the satellite program were presided over by the Army, it could have greatly surpassed Russia." This only shows that, in the eyes of some capitalists, their good opportunity has come again.
    Sure enough, although the American artificial satellite did not fly into the sky, the stock prices of some American companies flew into the sky. An Associated Press New York dispatch on October 6 said: "The news that Russia launched an artificial satellite... caused the aircraft stocks in the originally lifeless stock market to soar. ... Wall Street people expect that the funds used to develop missiles will increase. Therefore, the stock prices of companies in this area have risen." This is the American-style concern for "scientific development"!
    But in the Soviet Union, it is a completely different world. There is no capitalist rule, nor capitalist competition. No country has ever been able to truly care about the welfare of all people and the scientific progress of all mankind like a socialist country. It creates incomparably superior conditions for the development of science and technology, and enables all scientists and workers to fully exert their wisdom and talent. The Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite. This is a victory for the collectivism and creative labor of the Soviet people, a victory for the Soviet Union's advanced industry, science, and technology, and a victory for the socialist system. Now, this artificial satellite, emitting the light of peace and socialism, is singing a triumphant song that resounds through the clouds, paying tribute to the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution!

　　响彻云霄的凯歌
　　崔奇
    从收音机里传来人造卫星的有节奏的信号声。它令人想起贝多芬的月光曲。现在，全世界人民都在聆听着苏联科学家所创造的这个新的月光曲，他们正为人类打开征服宇宙之门而欢呼。
    把第一个人造卫星发射到天空去！这是社会主义国家和资本主义国家几年来的一场和平竞赛。在这场历史性的竞赛中，苏联胜利了。仿佛是克里姆林宫上的红星突然升上了高空，它飞过亚洲，飞过欧洲，飞过美国的华盛顿……
    苏联不声不响，但是走到前边来了；美国大吹大擂，却反而落后了。还在几年以前，美国就开始宣传它的人造卫星。美国政府接连发表了各种各样名称的人造卫星计划，美国的报刊上经常出现人造卫星的图片。1956年1月13日，合众社踌躇满志地报道说：“美国现在正在和俄国比赛谁先发射第一个环绕地球的卫星，美国希望在1957年9月30日之前使它的这只飞鸟进入外空间。”但是，直到今天，美国的人造卫星仍然停留在报画上，停留在模型展览会上，停留在地面上。
    为了挽救美国的名声，艾森豪威尔总统最近出来讲了话。他说：“我们从来没有把卫星计划当作和别的国家进行的竞赛来进行。”刚刚辞职的前国防部长威尔逊似乎比总统还要聪明，他说，美国本来就不准备在“科学发展方面”同苏联竞赛。但是，不论他们怎样用精神胜利法来自我解嘲，他们毕竟没有办法否认美国是落后了。参议员杰克逊承认：苏联发射第一个人造卫星，是“对美国的科学、工业和技术的名声一个毁灭性的打击”。另一个参议员薛明顿则要求国会调查为什么美国落后于苏联的问题。
    的确，美国为什么落后于苏联呢？这是一个很深刻的问题。不过，要是指望美国国会议员们给这个问题找出答案，那就太天真了。美国国会如果讨论这个问题，那只会意味着各垄断资本集团之间展开新的角斗。美联社早就报道说，在制造人造卫星方面，“政府各部门之间有很多摩擦”。“纽约美国人日报”也透露过关于“各个军种之间的争吵”。美国国会和政府所代表的垄断资本家们，从来就不会真正关心科学的发展，而只是关心如何从政府的订货合同中攫取更多的利润。他们从来就不会关心人类征服宇宙空间的问题，而只是关心如何征服他们一小撮人的竞争对手，以便进行更大的垄断。
    在资本主义制度下，不仅劳动力成了商品，科学人才成了商品，而且连科学工作本身也只是被看作“生财之道”。在这里，正同在资本主义的其他社会领域里一样，只有你争我夺的斗争。
    据说美国计划的人造卫星的火箭发动机，也是由三段组成的。可是，这样一个完整的火箭发动机并不是由一个统一的企业承造的，而是三个！通用电气公司制造第一段，通用喷气飞机公司制造第二段，大中央火箭公司制造第三段。这是由于垄断资本集团之间互相争夺的结果。
    在制造人造卫星方面，陆军部所代表的垄断资本集团没有抢到多少订货。于是，据美联社报道，最近“支持陆军的人”出来说风凉话了。他们夸口说：“如果由陆军主持卫星计划的话，本可以大大胜过俄国的。”这只表明，在某些资本家看来，他们的好机会又来了。
    果然，美国的人造卫星虽然没有飞上天，美国的某些企业的股票价格却飞上了天。美联社纽约10月6日电讯说：“俄国发射了一个人造卫星的消息……使本来并无生气的股票市场上的飞机股票猛涨。……华尔街人士预料用于发展导弹的经费将增加。因此这方面的公司的股票价格都上涨了。”这就是美国式的关心“科学发展”！
    但是在苏联，完全是另外一个世界。那儿没有资本家的统治，也没有资本家的竞争。从来没有任何国家能够像社会主义国家这样，真正关心全体人民的福利和全人类的科学进步，它给科学技术的发展创造了无比优越的条件，并使所有科学家和劳动者都能够充分发挥他们的智慧和天才。苏联发射了世界上第一个人造卫星，这是苏联人民的集体主义和创造性劳动的胜利，是苏联先进的工业、科学和技术的胜利，是社会主义制度的胜利。现在，这个发射着和平与社会主义光芒的人造卫星，正在唱着响彻云霄的凯歌，给十月革命的四十周年献礼！
