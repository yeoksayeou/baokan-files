Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Since liberation, nearly 9.9 million mu of wasteland in northern and southern Xinjiang have been reclaimed as arable land. More than one mu out of every three mu of cultivated land now in existence was newly cultivated after liberation.

Before liberation, Xinjiang had only 18 million mu of cultivated land. After liberation, as a result of the vigorous efforts of people of all ethnic groups and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the People's Liberation Army to reclaim wasteland and build water conservancy projects, 9.9 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in various parts of Xinjiang, more than 14,000 kilometers of new canals have been built, 38 large and small reservoirs have been constructed, and more than 80,000 kilometers of existing canal systems have been renovated. Consequently, the irrigated area has been expanded by 9.6 million mu. As of now, farmers of all ethnic groups throughout the region have reclaimed approximately 7 million mu of farmland.

The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the People's Liberation Army has made brilliant contributions to Xinjiang's land reclamation endeavor. Over the past eight years, this peaceful army has reclaimed more than 2.6 million mu of cultivated land in the wilderness north and south of the Tianshan Mountains and established 42 modernized farms. The banks of the once overgrown Manas River have been transformed into green oases with fields stretching across the horizon and crisscrossing canals. The state-owned farm complex composed of seventeen farms possesses more than 1.4 million mu of cultivated land. Anjihai Farm, China's largest cotton-growing farm, is located on the west bank of the Manas River and has 320,000 mu of cultivated land.

Due to large-scale land reclamation, water conservancy construction, and continuous improvement of agricultural cultivation techniques, Xinjiang, which was historically short of grain and cotton, has now become an increasingly important grain and cotton producing area in our country. The total grain output of Xinjiang in 1957 is approximately double that of 1949. Hami, Urumqi, Altay Prefecture, Yanqi, and other areas that were historically severely short of grain have now become surplus grain areas. In 1957, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang reached 1.75 million mu, an increase of 2.7 times compared to 1949. Not only has cotton production greatly developed in the southern Xinjiang region, where the temperature is higher, but the Production and Construction Corps has also opened up China's northernmost cotton-growing area in the Manas River basin around 44 degrees north latitude. Now cotton production has greatly increased. It is estimated that the total output of ginned cotton in Xinjiang this year will reach about 100 million jin, equivalent to ten times that of 1949. Since 1951, Xinjiang cotton has not only met the needs of local textile and daily cotton wadding, but has also transported more than 22.2 million jin of ginned cotton to Shanghai and other places to support the inland textile industry.

### 新疆解放后垦荒近千万亩  今年粮食产量等于1949年的两倍

    新疆解放后垦荒近千万亩
    今年粮食产量等于1949年的两倍
    新华社讯  新疆天山南北几年来有九百九十万亩荒地已被垦为良田。现有的每三亩耕地中，就有一亩多是解放后新开垦的土地。
    新疆在解放前只有耕地一千八百万亩。解放后，各族人民和人民解放军新疆生产建设兵团大力开荒造田和兴修水利的结果，全疆各地已开垦荒地九百九十万亩，新建渠道一万四千多公里，大小型水库三十八座，并对八万多公里的旧有渠系作了整修。因而，扩大了灌溉面积九百六十万亩。全区截至目前为止，各族农民已开垦的农田约有七百多万亩。
    人民解放军新疆生产建设兵团，对新疆的垦荒事业作出了光辉的贡献。八年来，这支和平大军，在天山南北的原野上开垦出二百六十多万亩耕地，建立起四十二个现代化的农场。昔日一片草莽的玛纳斯河两岸，已经变成了连田阡陌、渠道纵横的绿洲；由十七个农场组成的国营农场群，拥有一百四十多万亩耕地。我国最大植棉农场——安集海农场，就在玛纳斯河西岸，拥有耕地三十二万亩。
    由于大规模的开荒造田、兴修水利和不断改进农业耕作技术，历史上曾经是粮棉不足的新疆，现在已经成为我国日益重要的粮棉产地。1957年新疆粮食总产量，约等于1949年的两倍。解放前一贯缺粮比较严重的哈密、乌鲁木齐、阿勒泰专区和焉耆等地，现在也成了余粮地区。1957年，新疆棉花播种面积达一百七十五万亩，比1949年扩大了二点七倍。不仅气温较高的南疆地区棉花生产有很大发展，生产建设兵团还在北纬四十四度左右的玛纳斯河流域，开辟了我国最北部的植棉区。现在棉花产量已有了巨大增长，估计今年全疆皮棉的总产量约达一亿斤左右，相当于1949年的十倍。1951年以来，新疆棉花不但满足了本地纺织和日用絮棉的需要，还把二千二百多万斤皮棉运往上海等地，支援内地纺织工业。
