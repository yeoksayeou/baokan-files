	Soviet Academy of Sciences Discusses History of the American Workers' Movement
	According to the Soviet journal "Modern and Contemporary History," the Department of History of the Americas of the Institute of History of the Soviet Academy of Sciences held a discussion earlier this year on the formation of the proletariat and the history of the workers' movement in the United States, Latin American countries, and Canada.
	Participants in the meeting listened to Mo. Le. Chakharovoi's report "On the Characteristics of the Formation of the American Working Class." The reporter pointed out that while refuting the bourgeois fallacy of the uniqueness of American capitalism, Marxist-Leninist classics paid close attention to certain specific conditions and characteristics of American historical development. These conditions, especially the large amount of free state-owned land and the existence of immigration, affected the formation of a fixed core of the American proletariat before the 1880s. The possibility of moving to non-free land in the west created favorable conditions for the supply and demand of labor in the labor market, primarily resulting in higher wage levels for American workers compared to European countries. According to Chakharovoi, the American industrial revolution was completed in the period after the end of the Civil War. At this time, the independent labor movement was developing rapidly, which had stagnated during the period of slavery.
	Er. Fu. Ivanov gave a speech entitled "The American Working Class's Struggle for Unity in the 1870s," in which he suggested that the attitude of a large number of white workers against black people was the biggest obstacle to this unity, and that business owners were adept at exploiting this condition. The First International branches and black workers consistently defended the unity of workers regardless of their nationality, skin color, or skills.
	A. Mo. Zorina gave a speech on "The Formation Process of the Working Class in Latin American Countries." She pointed out the difficulties in the economic and political development of these countries, which were semi-colonial and agricultural countries, with often diverse economies, and some of which had retained many feudal remnants for a long time. Due to these reasons, in most Latin American countries, the working class was formed by farmers who had lost their land, bankrupt handicraftsmen, and immigrants from Spain, Italy, and other countries, and its growth rate was extremely slow. The first batch of workers' organizations—workshop brotherhoods, mutual aid groups—only appeared in Argentina and Cuba in the second half of the 19th century, and the first major mobilizations of the proletariat only appeared in Cuba in the 1880s and during the 1895-1902 national liberation war. Zorina also described the reasons why anarcho-syndicalism had a huge impact on the workers' movement in Latin American countries.
	When talking about the formation of the Canadian working class, A. I. Konochiev pointed out that in addition to the large inflow of foreign capital into the west in 1870, the land of the dominion itself also made Canada's capitalism develop rapidly. Until the early 20th century, immigration to the west hindered the growth of the working class, and later hindered the improvement of the proletariat's class consciousness.
	Bu. Yi. Kovari described the formation of the Brazilian working class. Fu. Yi. Yermolayev suggested that in Latin America, a modern proletariat was only formed in Argentina and Chile at the end of the First World War. Si. Fu. Molochkov expounded on the characteristics of the Canadian workers' movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. De. Ge. Nadrezhevov explained the fighting tradition of the American workers' movement.
	In his speech at the end of the discussion, Bu. Ya. Mikhailov emphasized that the American mainland did not cause a large number of small producers to lose their means of production, nor did it have serfdom. Therefore, to be precise, Europe was the cradle of the American proletariat. When the proletariat left Europe, they had already been deprived of their means of production and only had personal freedom left. Mikhailov pointed out that various ethnic components and highly skilled handicraftsmen were extremely beneficial to the American bourgeoisie, who were good at pitting workers of one ethnic group against workers of another ethnic group. Mikhailov's overall conclusion was that the American working class was completely formed in the 1870s and 1880s, established its own organizations, and expanded its economic struggle. However, due to many conditions, a large part of the working class has not yet been freed from the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, nor has it reached the level of conscious political struggle against the capitalist system.

    苏联科学院讨论美国工人运动史问题
    据苏联“近代和现代史”杂志报道，苏联科学院历史研究所美洲国家历史分部曾在今年年初举行了关于美国、拉丁美洲各国和加拿大无产阶级的形成和工人运动史等问题的讨论会。
    会议参加者听取了莫·勒·查哈罗沃依的“关于美国工人阶级形成的特点”的报告。报告人指出，马克思列宁主义经典作家们在驳斥美国资本主义特殊性这一资产阶级谬论的同时，也对美国历史发展的某些具体条件及其特点予以十分注意。这些条件，特别是大量自由的国有土地和移民的存在，影响到十九世纪八十年代前美国无产阶级固定的骨干的形成。移居到西部非自由土地上的可能性，对劳动者在劳动市场上的供求造成了有利的条件，首先就是使美国工人的工资水平较欧洲各国为高。按照查哈罗沃依的见解，在国内战争结束以后的时期里，美国工业革命已告完成。这时独立的工人运动已在急遽发展，而在奴隶制度存在时期是停滞不前的。
    尔·弗·伊凡诺夫作了题为“十九世纪七十年代美国工人阶级为团结而斗争”的发言，他提出了这样的意见，大量白种工人反对黑人的态度是这一团结的最大的障碍，而企业主却巧于利用这种条件。第一国际分部和黑人工人不论工人的民族、肤色和技能如何，始终一贯地捍卫着工人的团结。
    阿·莫·佐林娜作了关于“拉丁美洲各国工人阶级形成的过程”的发言。她指出了这些国家经济和政治发展上的困难，它们是半殖民地和农业的国家，经济又常常是多种多样的，其中有些国家长时期以来还保存着许多封建主义的残余。由于这些原因，在大多数拉丁美洲国家，工人阶级是由丧失了土地的农民、破了产的手工业者、西班牙、意大利等国的移民形成的，它的成长的速度极为缓慢。最初的一批工人组织——车间兄弟会、互助团体——只是在十九世纪下半期才在阿根廷和古巴出现，无产阶级的最初几次大发动是在十九世纪八十年代和1895—1902年民族解放战争时期才在古巴出现。佐林娜也叙述了无政府工团主义对拉丁美洲各国工人运动发生巨大影响的原因。
    阿·伊·科诺契夫在谈到加拿大工人阶级形成的问题时指出，除了在1870年外国资本大量流入西部以外，自治领本身的土地也使加拿大的资本主义迅速发展。直到二十世纪初叶，往西部移民阻碍着工人阶级的成长，而后来则妨碍着无产阶级阶级自觉的提高。
    布·伊·科瓦里叙述了巴西工人阶级的形成。弗·伊·叶尔莫拉耶夫提出了这样的意见：在拉丁美洲，只是在第一次世界大战结束时才在阿根廷和智利形成了现代无产阶级。斯·弗·莫洛契科夫阐述了十九世纪末和二十世纪初加拿大工人运动的特点。德·格·纳德热沃夫讲解了美国工人运动的战斗传统。
    在讨论会结束时发言的布·雅·米哈依洛夫着重指出，美国本土并没有使小生产者大量丧失生产工具，也没有农奴依附。因此，确切地说欧洲是美国无产者的摇篮，无产者离开欧洲时已经被剥夺了生产工具，只剩有人身自由。米哈伊洛夫指出，各种民族成分和具有高度技能的手工业者，对善于使这一民族与另一民族工人相对立的美国资产阶级来说，是极其有利的。米哈依洛夫的总的结论是，在十九世纪七十—八十年代美国工人阶级已完全形成，成立了自己的组织并扩展了经济斗争。但是，由于许多条件，工人阶级中有很大一部分人直到今天还并没有摆脱了资产阶级的思想影响，也没有达到对资本主义制度进行自觉的政治斗争的水平。（练柔译）
