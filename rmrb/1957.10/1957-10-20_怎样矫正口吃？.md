　　How to Correct Stuttering?
    Stuttering is caused by excessive mental tension, which prevents the brain from properly directing the activity of the speech organs. Children often become too nervous to speak after being reprimanded by impatient parents or teachers. If this happens frequently, they will become nervous when they open their mouths to speak later on. The more nervous they are, the less they can speak, and the less they can speak, the more nervous they become. This develops into a habit of stuttering.
    Some people's stuttering is caused by constantly imitating others' stuttering. After repeated imitation, they become unfamiliar with normal speech, and naturally stutter when they speak.
    Since stuttering is a habit, we have ways to overcome it. We should treat stutterers with sympathy and help, and should not ridicule them, so as not to increase their mental burden. People with stuttering problems should also correctly recognize that this is a habit that develops slowly, and overcoming it cannot be achieved in a short period of time. They should be patient, practice speaking more, learn to calm down, think about what they want to say before speaking, and then say each word slowly. Once they can speak slowly, they can further practice speaking faster. As long as they have perseverance and can train themselves step by step, stuttering can definitely be corrected.

　　怎样矫正口吃？
    口吃是由于精神过度紧张，大脑不能很好地领导发音器官的活动所引起的。儿童在遭到急躁的父母或教师的谴责后，常常会紧张得说不出话来。如果经常发生这种情况，以后一开口说话，精神就会紧张起来。越紧张越说不出话，越说不出话就越紧张。这样就养成了口吃的习惯。
    有些人的口吃，是由于经常模仿别人口吃而造成的。经过多次的模仿，对正常的说话反而生疏了，一说话就自然而然地口吃起来。
    既然口吃是一个习惯，我们就有办法来克服它。对待口吃的人，应该采取同情、帮助的态度，而不应该加以嘲笑，以免更加重了他的精神负担。有口吃毛病的人也应该正确地认识这是一个慢慢养成的习惯，要克服它也不是短时期可以做到的，应该有耐心，要多练习说话，要学着镇静，说话以前先把要说的话想好了，随后一个个字慢慢地说出来，慢的会说了，就可以再进一步练习说快些。只要有恒心，能按部就班地训练自己，口吃是一定可以矫正的。（转载1957年10月号“科学大众”）
