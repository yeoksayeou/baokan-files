Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th. The Soviet men's track and field team held an exhibition match with Chinese track and field athletes in Shanghai today, braving the light rain. Zheng Fengrong, who had just set a new national record of 1.73 meters in the women's high jump at the National Track and Field Games in Nanjing, jumped 1.74 meters in the competition. When she cleared this new height, Soviet male high jumper Stegin and Chinese female high jump athlete Fu Xueyan ran over to shake her hand, congratulating her on taking another step towards the world record. Zheng Fengrong's new result is only two centimeters lower than the world record. There are only four female athletes in the world who can jump this height: American black athlete McDaniel, the world record holder (1.76 meters), Soviet Chenchik, and Romanian Balas (both with a score of 1.75 meters), and British Hopkins (1.74 meters).

In the competition, male long jumper Gao Shugui and male triple jumper Li Rongguo not only broke the national records of 1956 but also surpassed the latest national results of these two events in 1957. Gao Shugui's score was 7.39 meters, reaching the sports master standard of 7.30 meters; Li Rongguo's score was 15.35 meters, which was 17 centimeters further than the new score created by Tian Zhaozhong in July this year.

A total of twenty-three men's and women's exhibition events were held today. Seven Soviet athletes participated in eight events and won eight first places.

The Soviet track and field team arrived in Shanghai on the 12th. They will go to Beijing on the 17th to prepare for another friendly match with Chinese track and field athletes on the 19th.
