    Lanzhou Carpets to be Shipped to the Soviet Union Soon
    The Northwest Wool Textile Factory in Lanzhou is launching a labor emulation drive to strive to complete the order of 10,000 plaid carpets for the Soviet Union one month ahead of schedule. As of early October, after strict inspection, 5,000 carpets have fully met export requirements.
    The Tianjin branch of the China Sundries Export Company has now sent personnel to Lanzhou to handle the shipping work. It is estimated that this batch of carpets can meet with Soviet consumers before the October Revolution Day. (Li Tinghui)

    兰州毛毯即将运苏联
    兰州西北毛纺厂正在展开劳动竞赛，争取将苏联所订购的一万条花格毛毯任务提前一个月完成。截至10月初，经严格检验，已有五千条完全符合出口要求。
    现在中国杂品出口公司天津分公司已派人前往兰州办理发运工作，估计这批毛毯于十月革命节以前可以跟苏联消费者见面。  （李廷辉）
