Knights Compete for Supremacy
    ——A Record of the Shenyang Motorcycle Skills Competition
	Shanying
    One clear morning, the sky above Shenyang Stadium suddenly thundered, shaking the earth. A red flag waved in the southwest corner: in an instant, dust billowed, and a red monster raised a mist line in the hundred-meter distance diagonally across the field. Only when that monster slowed down at the finish line could people see clearly: it was a "Jawa" motorcycle, driven by the athlete almost as if flying. This was a motorcycle skills competition recently held in Shenyang. The first event was the 100-meter race. After the starting signal, the athletes started their motorcycles and had to accelerate them to maximum speed in an instant. Scoring zero points required finishing in over eleven seconds. This stretch of road was uneven. Six short wooden stakes spaced two and a half meters apart forced the athletes to drive through them in a zigzag pattern. Knocking down a stake or putting a foot on the ground resulted in point deductions. Ahead were potholes as deep as one meter, and then a mound. Although the "move a water glass on a square table" event had little practical use, here it was a serious test of the athletes' composure and agility. The athletes had to reduce their speed, hold the handlebars with one hand, and if they were not calm, the motorcycle would shake and knock over the square table or spill the water in the glass. The left hand had to deftly pick up the glass from the first table while the motorcycle was moving and place it on the second table... This wonderful performance aroused great interest among the audience.

    Suddenly, the whole field erupted in warm applause. It turned out that athlete number 35, Kong Weiyou, dashed out of the starting point at high speed, passing through the obstacles with such ease and grace, as if he were walking on foot and not riding a motorcycle. The speed of his iron horse was not low, and he did not reduce his speed as others did, even when crossing the narrow bridge and inserting the red flag into the square box, both difficult obstacles. Look, he drilled into the "blockade circle." A circle of white lines on the ground with a diameter of less than five meters seemed to turn into a giant wall surrounding him, with another circle inside, sandwiching the knight in a one-meter-wide gap as he circled. With great effort, he finally drilled out of this blockade circle. Ahead, there were five consecutive sharp turns, forming a restricted road waiting for him. Kong Weiyou passed through smoothly again. At this time, he suddenly accelerated, and the engine roared. With a "whoosh," the motorcycle and the rider flew out more than eight meters... The audience burst into another round of warm applause. At this point, Kong Weiyou lightly passed through the last obstacle of the thirteen obstacles, the "anti-cliff." He finally scored full marks and won first place with a score of one hundred and thirty points.

    As the "Ismoto Motorcycle" group's competition ended, the stunt performances began. Five two-wheeled motorcycles circled the field in an orderly fashion. The audience had just applauded to greet them when the athletes on the five motorcycles suddenly disappeared. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that they, like knights in a circus, were hiding in their stirrups. In motorcycle soldier terminology, this is called concealed driving. At this time, people couldn't help but feel as if they were seeing a team of motorcycle soldiers cleverly charging into battle! If enemy fire were discovered, there would be no need to worry. Look, the five knights who were speeding along suddenly made a sharp turn, falling to the ground along with their mounts. However, the engine did not stop running. As long as they seized the opportunity, they would jump back on their iron horses and rush forward! After performing sharp turns and lying down, and turning in place, they performed the "driving through a ring of fire" and "wheel exchange on a three-wheeled motorcycle." Although these two items were already familiar to people, they still felt extremely thrilling! Driving through a ring of fire with tongues of flame and rolling smoke; and forcing the wheel of a speeding vehicle to be suspended in the air for a long time, this requires courage and strength!

    After watching this motorcycle competition, people cannot help but be happy for the development of our country's national defense sports movement. (Attached photo)

　　骑士争雄
　　——记沈阳市摩托车技巧比赛
　　山鹰
    一个天气晴朗的清晨，沈阳市体育场上空却突然雷声滚滚，惊天动地。只见西南角上，红旗一摆：霎时间烟尘飞卷，在斜穿全场的百公尺距离中一个红色的怪物扬起一股雾线。直到终点，那个怪物放慢了速度时，人们才看清：那是一台“佳娃”摩托车，被运动员驾驶得几乎飞起来。这是最近沈阳市举行的一次摩托车技巧比赛。第一项是百公尺比赛，发令后运动员起车，在转瞬间就得把车驰到最大速度，到终点超过十一秒就得零分。这一段路是不平坦的。途中间隔二公尺半并排的六个矮木桩，逼着运动员不得不驾车曲折通过，碰倒一个木桩或脚着地就得扣分。前边又出现深达一公尺的弹坑、又是一个土丘。方桌移水杯这个项目，虽然实际使用价值不大，可在这里它对运动员的沉着、灵敏性却是个严重的考验。运动员只要把车速减低，单手扶把，稍不沉着车就乱晃而撞倒方桌或洒了杯中水，左手得在车子行进中，灵巧地从第一个桌上端起水杯，再放在第二个桌子上……。这项精彩的表演，引起了观众们极大的兴趣。
    突然，全场暴发了热烈的掌声，原来三十五号运动员孔维有，疾飞着冲出了起点，在通过各道障碍时，是那样轻松如意，就仿佛他没有骑摩托车，而是在徒步行走一样。他所驾驶的铁骑的速度并不低，甚至在过独木桥和方箱插红旗那样难关，他也没像别人那样减低速度。看，他钻进了“封锁圈”，地面上直径不到五公尺的一圈白线好像变成了巨壁围住了他，里边还有一圈，把这位骑士夹在一公尺宽的空隙里转起圈子。好不容易才钻出这个封锁圈。前边又有连续五个急转弯的限制路等待着他，孔维有又顺利通过了。这时，他又猛加油门，马达嘶声吼叫着。只见“嗖”一下，连车带人飞出八公尺多远……观众又是一阵热烈鼓掌。至此，孔维有轻快地通过十三道障碍的最后一道“反峭壁”。他终于全部获得满分，以一百三十分的成绩夺得了第一名。
    在“依斯摩托车”组的运动员们比赛结束时，特技表演开始了。五辆双轮摩托车鱼贯绕场一周，观众刚刚鼓掌致意，五辆摩托车上的运动员忽然不见了，仔细一瞧，原来他们像马戏中的骑士一样来个镫里藏身，用摩托兵的术语来说：这叫隐蔽驾驶。这时，人们不禁感到眼前好像是一队摩托兵，正在巧妙地冲锋陷阵！假若发现敌人炮火，也用不着担心。看吧，奔驰着的五位骑士，骤然急转弯连同坐骑一起卧倒在地。不过马达并未停止转动，只要抓住空隙，他们又翻身跳上铁骑向前冲去！在表演过急转弯卧倒、原地转弯以后，又表演了穿火圈和三轮摩托车的飞轮换带。这两个项目，虽然早已为人们所熟悉，但看起来仍然感到万分惊险！驱车穿过火舌乱窜浓烟翻滚的火圈；硬要使疾驰中的车子一轮长久悬空，这得需要勇敢和力量呵！
    看了这一场摩托车比赛，人们不能不为我国的国防体育运动的开展而高兴。（附图片）
