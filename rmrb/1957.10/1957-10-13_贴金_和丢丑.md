　　"Gilding" and Making a Fool of Oneself
    Following the Soviet Union's successful launch of the first artificial satellite, the reaction of Lord Hailsham, Chairman of the British Conservative Party, was extraordinary. He said it was "a victory for British technical education."

    How can the Soviet Union's brilliant achievement in science demonstrate "a victory for British technical education"? The reason given by Lord Hailsham is: allegedly, one of the scientists who played a major role in the Soviet Union's manufacturing of the artificial satellite studied at Cambridge University in Britain.

    Whether what Lord Hailsham said is true or not can be left aside for the moment. Because even if this is true, his fanciful statement cannot gain any support. Thousands of people have studied at Cambridge University in Britain, and Soviet citizens are a minority among the minority. Why is it that Soviet citizens are the first to make a great contribution to the glorious cause of manufacturing artificial satellites, while British scientists lag behind?

    Therefore, Lord Hailsham's statement cannot bring any glory to British technical education, but will only make him a laughing stock in front of the people of the world. The comments of many British bourgeois newspapers have actually slapped this Lord heavily in the face. For example, the conservative "Daily Mail" believes that the Soviet scientists and engineers achieved this success because the Soviet Union established "a technical education system that we cannot imagine." It complains that Britain has made little effort to improve the level of education.

    However, one point is worth pondering: Lord Hailsham has always been hostile to the Soviet Union, and even in his speech this time, there are many slanders against the Soviet Union. However, even such an anti-Soviet politician is now shamelessly trying to use the achievements of the Soviet Union to "gild" the face of Britain. This fact illustrates an important issue.

　　“贴金”和丢丑
    苏联成功地发射了第一颗人造卫星以后，英国保守党主席黑尔什姆勋爵的反应是异乎寻常的。他说，这是“英国技术教育的胜利”。
    苏联在科学上的光辉成就居然能表明“英国技术教育的胜利”，这是什么缘故呢？黑尔什姆勋爵提出的理由是：据说，在苏联制造人造卫星工作中起主要作用的科学家中，有一个人是在英国剑桥大学学习过的。
    黑尔什姆勋爵所说的情况是否属实，可以姑且不论。因为，即使这一点是真的，他那种想入非非的说法也并不能得到任何支持。在英国剑桥大学学习过的人有成千上万，其中苏联人是少数中的少数。为什么能够首先对制造人造卫星这件光辉的事业作出巨大贡献的偏偏是苏联人，而英国的科学家却反而瞠乎其后呢？
    因此，黑尔什姆勋爵的说法决不能给英国的技术教育带来什么光采，而只会使他自己在全世界人民面前丢丑。英国很多资产阶级报纸的评论实际上已经在这位勋爵脸上重重地打了几下巴掌。例如，保守的“每日简报”就认为，苏联科学家和工程师取得这个成就是由于苏联建立了“我们所想象不到的技术教育系统”。它抱怨英国很少努力来提高教育水平。
    但是，有一点倒是值得沉思的：黑尔什姆勋爵是一贯仇视苏联的，就是在他这次发表的谈话中也有着不少对苏联的诬蔑。然而，即使这样一个反苏的政治家，现在也恬不知耻地企图用苏联的成就在英国的脸上贴金。这个事实，就说明了一个重要的问题。
