Baituo Township Improves Backward Cooperatives Through Extensive Airing of Views, Big Debates
CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee Work Group

Can backward agricultural cooperatives with many problems be rectified and consolidated through extensive airing of views and big debates, and criticism of capitalist ideology? The experiences of Zhongxiang and Xiaxiang Cooperatives in Baituo Township, Qujiang County, Guangdong Province, provide an affirmative answer.

The changes experienced by Zhongxiang and Xiaxiang Cooperatives since last year reflect one issue: the serious struggle between socialism and capitalism in the countryside has not ended.

The Struggle Between Two Roads Has Not Ended

Last spring, Zhongxiang and Xiaxiang underwent a profound change – the establishment of two advanced agricultural cooperatives, achieving a socialist revolution in the economy. In the first year of the cooperatives, they overcame a severe drought unseen in decades, and Zhongxiang Cooperative became a third-class model cooperative in Qujiang County. However, small farmers, accustomed to individual economic life for thousands of years, cannot be completely transformed into collective socialist farmers overnight. However, because the leadership did not emphasize continuing the struggle between the two roads, and did not continue to firmly grasp the revolution on the political and ideological fronts, there was a significant gap between the ideological understanding of cooperative members and the collective economy of the cooperatives, and capitalist ideas gradually developed, taking advantage of this gap. After the second half of last year, these two cooperatives experienced another change: everywhere one could hear arguments negating the superiority of collectivization and the necessity of unified purchase and supply; five households in Zhongxiang Cooperative withdrew from the cooperative, and many other members wavered; many members stopped working; fertilizer was not sold to the cooperative; labor discipline was lax; manure from household livestock was desperately piled on private plots, while they clamored daily to the cooperative for money for oil, salt, and medical expenses, and even demanded that the cooperative fully cover the sixty yuan in tuition and miscellaneous fees for their sons attending middle school for one semester. When the cooperative could not pay, they cursed.

At this time, the core leadership of the cooperatives – the Party branch and the cooperative committee – was close to disintegrating. In Zhongxiang Cooperative, three of the original five Party members showed poor performance; one was the deputy director of the cooperative, and the other two were members of the cooperative committee and production team leaders. In serious cases, they simply ignored the work of the cooperative, burying themselves in household sideline occupations, and even taking the lead in attacking the cooperative. Other non-Party members of the cooperative committee caused even greater dissatisfaction among the members due to unclear accounts and rigid work styles. Both cooperatives were left with only a few backbone members and Party member directors and secretaries who were loyal to the cooperative, struggling to maintain the situation and defend the socialist position.

At this most difficult moment, class enemies believed it was the most opportune time for them to attack the socialist system. They plotted behind the scenes, spread rumors, and viciously slandered the cooperative. Bad elements in Xiaxiang Cooperative even colluded with some people with serious capitalist ideas to jointly accuse cooperative cadres of collective embezzlement to the Shaoguan Prefectural Commissioner's Office, demanding the removal of the cadres.

This created a complex situation: the contradictions between capitalism and socialism, the internal contradictions of the cooperative, and the contradictions between the broad masses of peasants and class enemies were intertwined, with countless loose ends. Zhongxiang Cooperative thus changed from a third-class model cooperative to a backward cooperative. Although the production situation in Xiaxiang Cooperative was slightly better, from a political and ideological perspective, it was also a "brother in distress" compared to Zhongxiang Cooperative.

Eliminating Ideological Concerns, Extensive Airing of Views and Big Debates

How should the work begin? After the start of the socialist propaganda and education movement, the county Party committee work group and the district Party committee helped these two cooperatives, first cracking down on the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements, suppressing the rampant evil influence, and the situation began to change. The representative figures of capitalist ideology, the well-to-do middle peasants, stopped speaking out, and even said good things about the cooperative; the cooperative cadres saw that the cooperative was calm, the attendance rate in Zhongxiang Cooperative rose sharply from 50% to over 90%, their morale was high, and they were overjoyed, thinking that the cooperative had been consolidated. In fact, there was a hidden danger: the struggle to crack down on the destructive actions of the enemies could cover up the contradictions within the people; formalism could replace the in-depth and meticulous mobilization of the masses to carry out ideological education. In this way, carrying out socialist education and democratic rectification work would run the risk of not being thorough and deep enough.

Therefore, it is necessary to arm the backbone, mobilize the masses, and carry out extensive airing of views and big debates within the cooperative. However, at this time, both cadres and the masses had concerns. What were the cadres' concerns? First, they were afraid that views would not be aired: "These are all the opinions there are, no matter how much more airing or letting go, there's nothing more than this"; second, they were afraid that they would not be able to clean up the mess: "The destructive actions of the bad elements have just been suppressed, if we let go, won't monsters and demons be released again?"; third, they were afraid of being rectified themselves: "If views are aired, they will seize on the cadres." The masses also had various concerns, such as not believing that the opinions raised could really be changed, and worrying that if they raised the wrong opinions, they would be "dragged to the threshing ground for struggle."

In response to this situation, the work group first cleared up the thinking of the main backbone of the cooperative and made several mobilizations among the cadres and members, explaining that the struggle against the destructive actions of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries was a practice of dictatorship against the enemy; now, carrying out extensive airing of views and big debates among the members was to clarify the major issues of right and wrong and the minor issues, overcome capitalist ideas, and consolidate the cooperative. These are two completely different things.

After repeated mobilization, the concerns of the cadres and the masses were gradually dispelled, and they officially entered the stage of extensive airing of views and big debates.

Four Steps

The extensive airing of views and big debates in Zhongxiang and Xiaxiang Cooperatives were divided into four steps.

The first step: Extensive airing of views and letting go. Long before the counterattack against the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements, these two cooperatives had already begun extensive airing of views and letting go. But that was done spontaneously, and it was impossible to fully expose the problems, or to comprehensively and systematically collect the opinions that were beneficial to the cooperative in order to improve the work. Moreover, immediately turning to debates after the counterattack against the destructive activities of landlords and rich peasants easily blurred the lines with the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, causing people to have illusions, which was not conducive to the development of the movement. Therefore, it was decided to continue the extensive airing of views and letting go.

After three or four days of extensive airing of views and letting go, in order to thoroughly solve ideological problems, the issue of withdrawal from the cooperative was proactively raised, targeting the idea of some well-to-do middle peasants who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative and work on their own. It was announced that the cooperative was not afraid and welcomed individual households to compete with the cooperative in agricultural production, and measures were stipulated to restrict the past capitalist and loophole-drilling behaviors of individual households. Under such conditions, those who still wanted to withdraw from the cooperative after repeated education were allowed to withdraw. The issue stirred the members greatly, and there were immediate different reactions. Well-to-do middle peasants tested the waters, and some even put forward their own conditions for withdrawal; the less resolute among the poor and lower-middle peasants, reversed their usual ambiguous attitude, and expressed that "we hope the cooperative is good when we join, we resolutely will not withdraw." And they attacked the withdrawal attempts of the well-to-do middle peasants. At this point, the extensive airing of views and letting go reached a climax.

The second step: Organize the ranks, rectify and reform simultaneously. After the extensive airing of views and letting go, it is not possible to immediately turn to big debates. There must be a period of time to educate and elevate the activists who are determined to take the socialist road, and through them, to unite and educate the members who are basically able to take the socialist road but are somewhat wavering, and form a team.

There are two things to grasp in organizing the ranks: one is to mobilize and connect according to the class line, and the other is to emphasize rectifying and reforming simultaneously.

Judging from the situation of Zhongxiang and Xiaxiang Cooperatives, there are currently four types of people in the cooperative: the first type are those who firmly support taking the socialist road, they are the conscious and most determined members of the poor and lower-middle peasants (including a few genuinely conscious well-to-do middle peasants), accounting for about 30% of the cooperative; the second type are those who basically support socialism but are somewhat wavering, they are the less conscious and less determined members of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and a small number of well-to-do middle peasants who do not reduce their income after joining the cooperative, have difficulty working on their own after withdrawing, and are willing to take the socialist road also belong to this category, accounting for about 60%, and are the majority of the members; the third type are those who have serious capitalist ideas and are unwilling to take the socialist road, they are well-to-do middle peasants and lazy loafers, although they only account for about 10%, they are typical figures representing capitalist ideas in the current struggle between the two roads in the countryside. In addition, there are landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries under control and other bad elements, we do not put them in the category of peasants but classify them as the fourth type. Organizing the ranks is to rely on the first type of people to connect and mobilize the second type of people, improve class consciousness, form a socialist class team, and launch a reasoning struggle with the third type of people to refute them, and unite and win over as many of them as possible to take the socialist road. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries under control, and other bad elements are the objects of dictatorship, they can also participate in airing their views, but we should be vigilant about their destructive actions and not allow them to talk and act recklessly.

While organizing the ranks, Zhongxiang and Xiaxiang Cooperatives also emphasized rectifying and reforming simultaneously. This is especially important for backward cooperatives. One of the characteristics of backward cooperatives is that the members have lost confidence in the leadership and are urgently demanding improvement in the work. If some outstanding problems are not grasped and solved after airing the views, it will be impossible to mobilize the masses, isolate capitalist elements, and form a team.

The third step: Big Debates. The main purpose of the first two steps is to clarify major issues of right and wrong in the big debates and to refute capitalist ideas. One of the important experiences of Zhongxiang and Xiaxiang Cooperatives is to hold various forums before the big debates, conduct detailed investigations and research, and widely collect convincing materials; and in the big debates, to clarify the facts and explain the truth through the method of accounting and reasoning. In this way, it will not be difficult to refute various fallacies. It is a very powerful weapon that can carry out reasoning struggle from beginning to end, so that the object of reasoning is convinced, and also improve the consciousness of the peasants present.

Li Jiexiang, a well-to-do middle peasant in Zhongxiang Cooperative who had long been dissatisfied with the cooperative, said, "It's not good to join the cooperative, there is no money for oil and salt, and income has decreased after joining the cooperative." So, we calculated detailed accounts with her. Before joining the cooperative in 1955, her family cultivated thirteen and a half mu of land and raised one pig. After deducting costs, the total net income was two hundred and thirty-one yuan and fifty cents. After joining the cooperative in 1956, the total net income for the whole year was two hundred and five yuan, a decrease of twenty-six yuan and fifty cents compared to before joining the cooperative. Why did it decrease? It turned out that she became lazier after joining the cooperative and did fifty-odd fewer workdays, so her income decreased. If she could be as energetic as before joining the cooperative, she would not only not decrease her income, but also increase it. After the accounts were cleared, she was asked, "Why do you blame the cooperative?" She felt that she was wrong and had to admit defeat. Accounting and reasoning is a good method. Facts have proved that many "income-decreasing households" do not decrease their income, and even increase it, mainly because when calculating the income before joining the cooperative, they calculated the total income as net income. Therefore, when accounting, the "caliber" before and after joining the cooperative must be aligned. Huang Denan, a well-to-do middle peasant in Zhongxiang Cooperative, found that he was originally an income-increasing household after accounting, admitted that it was wrong to complain in the past, and automatically made a self-criticism to the masses, and also used his own example to persuade others. These examples prove that accounting and reasoning is the most convincing.

For other arguments against socialism, we cannot rely solely on grand principles, but must use sufficient materials to convince people with reason. For example, some people say: "The cooperative's production is not as good as working on your own." Xiaxiang Cooperative conducted a block-by-block survey of the land in the whole cooperative, and the increase in production fields far exceeded the decrease in production fields. The reasons for the decrease in production were the drought last year and the blindness in the implementation of technological reforms, which have been corrected this year. And the rainfall is sufficient, so the decrease in production fields has no longer decreased. Some people say: "Unified purchase and supply is not good." The purchase and sale of grain and oil in these two cooperatives can completely refute this erroneous argument, and it is extremely convincing. Although Zhongxiang Cooperative is a surplus grain cooperative, it is a unified supply cooperative for edible oil, and the state supplied 600 jin of crude oil last year; Xiaxiang Cooperative is a unified purchase cooperative for peanuts, but a unified supply cooperative for grain, and the state supplied 160,000 jin of rice last year. May I ask: if more is not willing to be transferred out, where will the shortage be transferred from?

After about a week of small and large group debates, various "wrong principles" were refuted, and most of the reasoning objects admitted that they had lost. Of course, there are still a few who stubbornly refused to admit defeat, but they have been isolated among the masses, and it is not easy for them to have a great impact.

The fourth step: Democratic elections and organizational construction. Democratic elections are to consolidate the results of the socialist big debates organizationally, especially for backward cooperatives whose leadership is on the verge of disintegration and has lost the confidence of the masses. If elections are not held after airing the views and debating to reorganize the leadership, it will not only be insufficient to meet the wishes of the members, but also impossible to consolidate the results of the democratic rectification.

After clarifying the major issues of right and wrong through extensive airing of views, organizing the ranks, rectifying and reforming simultaneously, and big debates, the masses have a clear idea of who to elect as cadres. We put forward four standards: first, resolutely support socialism; second, work actively and love the cooperative as their home; third, be fair in handling affairs; fourth, be democratic in work style. After discussing the four standards, the members have a clearer idea of who to elect as cadres. The results of the election show that after extensive airing of views and big debates, the consciousness of the masses has been significantly improved, and the elected cadres are generally activists and good people who have influence among the masses.

Establishing the Leadership Advantage of the Poor Peasants

However, the election was not without struggle. Whether in Zhongxiang or Xiaxiang, the struggle of the well-to-do middle peasants to seize leadership from the poor and lower-middle peasants was very sharp, especially in Xiaxiang. When discussing the conditions, the well-to-do middle peasants and other impure elements in Xiaxiang Cooperative first opposed setting conditions, believing that "having conditions is 'having people without a master'." Most members rejected their opinions and emphasized that firmly supporting socialism was the primary condition for being elected as a cadre; they believed that the third and fourth conditions should be emphasized. When their opinions were rejected again, they threatened to withdraw from the meeting and not participate in the election. Although they ultimately failed, it raises a new issue: in the future, due to strengthening the struggle against the capitalist ideas of the well-to-do middle peasants and strengthening the restrictions on spontaneous tendencies outside the cooperative, most of the well-to-do middle peasants will continue to remain in the cooperative, and their main method of struggle will not be to withdraw from the cooperative, but to seize leadership within the cooperative. This is a very noteworthy issue. We must educate all cooperative cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants that, on the one hand, we must criticize the capitalist ideas of the well-to-do middle peasants and unite them in the cooperative to do a good job in production, and on the other hand, we must adhere to the leadership advantage of the poor peasants and be vigilant against the activities of the well-to-do middle peasants to seize leadership.

The pilot project in Baituo Township fully exposed the serious problems in the ideological understanding and work style of the current rural Party and Youth League organizations and Party and League members, and should be rectified well in organizational construction. We must conduct in-depth socialist class education and discipline education within the Party and the League. Party and League members who have wavering positions, wrong views, violate laws and regulations, and become detached from the masses in the extensive airing of views and big debates should be strictly criticized and educated, and those whose circumstances are serious and refuse to correct their mistakes should be dealt with severely.

Now, Zhongxiang and Xiaxiang Cooperatives have ended the extensive airing of views and big debates, re-elected the cooperative committee, and on this basis, are carrying out tasks such as formulating next year's production plan, earnestly doing a good job in the "three guarantees," implementing the contract system for grain, oil, and pig production tasks, clearing up finances and publicizing accounts, and adjusting production organizations to improve management.

    白土乡通过大鸣大放大争提高了落后社
    中共广东省委工作组
    能否通过大鸣大放大争，批判资本主义思想，把问题很多的落后农业社整顿好，使之巩固起来？广东省曲江县白土乡中乡社和下乡社的经验作了肯定的答复。
    中乡社和下乡社去年以来经历的变化，反映了一个问题：社会主义同资本主义的严重斗争在农村并没有结束。
    两条道路的斗争并没有结束
    去年春天，中乡和下乡经历了一次深刻的变化——建立了两个高级农业社，从经济上实现了社会主义革命。建社第一年就战胜了几十年未遇的大旱灾，中乡社成为曲江县的三等模范社。但是，千百年来习惯于个体经济生活的小农，并不是一下就能彻底改造成为集体的社会主义的农民的。但是，由于领导方面没有强调继续进行两条道路的斗争，没有继续抓紧进行政治战线和思想战线上的革命，合作社社员的思想认识同合作社的集体经济之间就有着很大距离，资本主义思想就利用这个空子逐渐发展起来。去年下半年以后，这两个社就经历着另一次变化：到处可以听到否定合作化的优越性，否定统购统销的必要性等论调；中乡社有五户社员退出了合作社，不少一部分社员跟着动摇了；许多社员不出勤了；不卖肥料给社了；劳动纪律废弛了；家栏肥拚命往自留地上堆，却天天向社吵着要油盐钱，要医药费，甚至儿子念中学一个学期六十元的学杂费都要由社全部负责，社支付不了就骂娘。
    这时，社的领导核心——党支部和社委已接近陷于解体状态。中乡社原来五个党员有三个党员表现不好，一个是社的副主任，另两个是社委和生产队长，严重的时候他们根本不管社的工作，埋头搞家庭副业，甚至带头攻击合作社；另一部分非党社委则因账目不清、作风生硬，更引起社员不满。两个社都只剩下极少数几个骨干分子和对合作社忠心耿耿的党员主任与支书，在苦撑危局，坚守社会主义阵地。
    在这最困难的时刻，阶级敌人却认为是他们进攻社会主义制度最有利的时机。他们幕后策动，背地造谣，大肆污蔑合作社，下乡社的坏分子甚至串通一部分资本主义思想严重的人，联名到韶关专署诬告社干部集体贪污，要求撤换干部。
    这样就形成了一种错综复杂的局面：资本主义同社会主义的矛盾，合作社内部的矛盾，广大农民同阶级敌人的矛盾绞在一起，头绪万端。中乡社就这样由一个三等模范社变成落后社。下乡社生产情况虽然稍好些，但从政治思想情况来看，比之中乡社也是“难兄难弟”。
    消除思想顾虑，大鸣大放大争
    应当怎样开始工作呢？县委工作组和区委在社会主义宣传教育运动开始之后，帮助这两个社，首先打击了地主、富农和坏分子的破坏活动，压下嚣张的邪气，情况开始有了变化。资本主义思想的代表人物富裕中农不吭声了，甚至也说合作社的好话了；社干部看见社内一片平静，出勤率中乡社由50％骤升至90％以上，情绪高涨，满心欢喜，认为社已经巩固了。其实，这里面隐伏着一种危险：打击敌人破坏行为的斗争，有可能掩盖了人民内部的矛盾；形式主义走过场，有可能代替深入细致的发动群众，进行思想教育的工作。这样开展社会主义教育和民主整社工作就有搞得不深不透的危险。
    为此，必须武装骨干，向群众动员，在社内开展大鸣大放大争。但是，这个时候干部和群众都有顾虑。干部有什么顾虑呢？一怕鸣不起来：“就是这些意见了，再鸣再放也就这么多了”；二怕收拾不了：“刚刚把坏分子的破坏行为打下去，一放，牛鬼蛇神不又放出来了”？三怕整到自己：“鸣放起来，他们又会揪住干部。群众也有种种顾虑，比如不相信提了的意见真能改，担心提错了意见，会“拉到禾坪去斗。”
    工作组针对这种情况，首先弄通社的主要骨干思想并分别在干部和社员中作了几次动员，说明斗争地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏行为是对敌人实行专政的做法；现在，在社员中开展大鸣大放大争是为了弄清大是大非和小是小非，克服资本主义思想，巩固合作社。这是完全不同的两件事。
    经过反复动员之后，干部和群众的顾虑逐步打消了，于是正式进入大鸣大放大争。
    四个步骤
    中乡社和下乡社的大鸣大放大争分为四个步骤。
    第一步，大鸣大放。远在反击地富坏分子的破坏活动之前，这两个社就已经开始了大鸣大放。但那是自发地进行的，不可能充分暴露问题，不可能把对合作社有益的意见全面地系统地收集起来，用以改进工作。而且在反击地主富农破坏活动之后，立即转到争论，很容易同敌我矛盾混淆在一起，使人产生错觉，不利于运动的开展。因此确定仍然继续大鸣大放。
    在大鸣大放了三、四天以后，为了彻底解决思想问题，又针对一部分富裕中农要求退社单干的思想，主动提出退社问题。宣布合作社不害怕而且欢迎单干户同社进行农业生产竞赛，对于单干户过去进行资本主义和钻空子的行为，则规定办法加以限制。在这样的条件下，经过再三教育仍要退社的人，允许退社。问题一提出，社员震动很大，立即发生不同的反映。富裕中农纷纷试探口气，有的还提出自己的退社条件；贫农和下中农中不够坚决的部分，则一反平日的模棱两可态度，表示“进社望社好，我们坚决不退社”。并对富裕中农的退社企图进行抨击。至此大鸣大放达到高潮。
    第二步，组织队伍，边整边改。大鸣大放之后不可以立即转入大辩论，必须有一段时间来教育提高坚决走社会主义的积极分子，并通过他们去团结教育基本上能走社会主义但有一些动摇的社员，形成队伍。
    组织队伍要抓两条：一是按阶级路线去发动串连，一是强调边整边改。
    根据中乡社和下乡社的情况看来，目前合作社里有四类人：第一类是坚决拥护走社会主义的人，他们是贫农和下中农中有觉悟、最坚定的分子（包括个别真正有觉悟的富裕中农），大约在合作社中只占30％左右；第二类是基本上拥护社会主义但有些动摇的人，他们是贫农和下中农中觉悟较低、不够坚定的分子，少数入社后不减收，退社单干有困难，愿意走社会主义道路的富裕中农也属于这类人，他们约占60％左右，是社员中的多数；第三类是资本主义思想严重，不愿意走社会主义道路的人，他们是富裕中农和好吃懒做的流氓懒汉，人数虽只占10％左右，但却是目前农村两条道路斗争中代表资本主义思想的典型人物。此外是地主、富农、被管制的反革命分子和其他坏分子，我们不把它放在农民范畴内而划作第四类。组织队伍就要依靠第一类分子去串连发动第二类分子，提高阶级觉悟，形成社会主义的阶级队伍，同第三类分子展开说理斗争，把他们驳倒，并尽可能多地团结争取他们走社会主义的道路。对于地主、富农、被管制的反革命分子和其他坏分子，是专政对象，他们也可以参加鸣放，但是应当警惕他们的破坏行为，不许他们乱说乱动。
    在组织队伍的同时，中乡社和下乡社还强调了边整边改。这对落后社尤其重要。落后社的特点之一是社员对领导失去信心，又迫切要求改进工作。如果不在鸣放之后抓紧一些突出问题。加以解决，就不可能调动群众，孤立资本主义分子，组成队伍。
    第三步，大辩论。前两步的主要目的是为了在大辩论中弄清大是大非，驳倒资本主义思想。中乡社和下乡社的重要经验之一，是要在大辩论前召开各种座谈会，进行细致的调查研究，广泛搜集有说服力的材料；大辩论中通过算账说理的办法，摆明事实，说透道理。这样，就不难把各种谬论驳倒。既能从头到尾贯彻说理斗争，使说理对象被说服，又能提高到会农民的觉悟，是个非常有力的武器。
    中乡社富裕中农李结香是长期对社不满的，她说，“入社不好，没有油盐钱，入社后减少了收入”。于是找她算细账。1955年入社前她家耕田地十三亩半，养猪一头，除成本外，共得纯收入二百三十一元五角。1956年入社后，全年纯收入总计二百零五元，比入社前减收二十六元五角。为什么减收呢？原来她入社后懒了些，少做了五十多个劳动日，因此减收了。如果她能像入社前一样起劲，就不但不减收，而且会增收。账算清了，质问她“为什么怪社不好呢？”她感到理屈，只好认输了。算账说理是个好办法。事实证明许多“减收户”并不减收，甚至增收，主要是计算入社前收入时，把总收入当作纯收入来计算。因此，算账，必须把入社前后的“口径”对齐。中乡社的富裕中农黄德南经过算账后，发现自己原来是增收户，承认过去讲怪话不对，并自动向群众作了检讨，还用自己的事例去说服别人。这些事例证明算账说理是最有说服力的。
    对于其他各种反对社会主义的论调，也不能光靠大道理，而必须使用充分的材料，做到以理服人。比如有人说：“社的生产不如单干”。下乡社将全社土地进行逐块调查的结果，增产田远比减产田多，减产原因是去年天旱和推行技术改革有盲目性，今年已经改正，雨水又足，因此减产田已不减产。有人说：“统购统销不好”。这两个社的粮、油的购销情况，就完全可以驳倒这种错误论调，并且极有说服力。中乡社虽是余粮社但是食油统销社，去年由国家供应了六百斤生油；下乡社虽是花生统购社但是粮食统销社，去年由国家供应了稻谷十六万斤。试问：多的不肯调出，缺的又从那里调入？
    经过一个星期左右的小会、大会辩论，各种“歪道理”都被驳倒了，说理对象大多数承认自己输了。当然，也还有少数人强辩到底不认输的，但在群众中已陷于孤立，也就不容易发生大影响了。
    第四步，民主选举和组织建设。民主选举是为了从组织上巩固社会主义大辩论的成果，特别是领导濒于解体、已失众望的落后社，如果在鸣放与辩论之后不进行选举，改组领导，不但不足以满足社员的愿望，而且要巩固民主整社的成果，也是不可能的。
    在经过大鸣大放，组织队伍，边整边改和大辩论把大是大非弄清楚之后，要选谁来当干部群众是有底的，我们提出四条标准：第一、坚决拥护社会主义；第二、工作积极，爱社如家；第三、办事公道；第四、作风民主。社员经过对四条标准的讨论后，要选谁来当干部就更有底了。选举的结果表明，经过大鸣大放大争之后，群众觉悟已有显著提高，当选的干部一般都是在群众中有影响的积极分子和好人。
    树立贫农的领导优势
    但是，选举不是没有斗争的。不论在中乡或下乡，富裕中农向贫农下中农争夺领导权的斗争都很尖锐，下乡尤其激烈。下乡社的富裕中农和其他不纯分子在讨论条件时，首先反对提条件，认为“有条件就是‘有民无主’”。大多数社员否定了他们的意见，并强调坚决拥护社会主义是当选干部的首要条件；他们则认为要强调第三、四条。当他们的意见再次被否定时，他们又以退出会场，不参加选举相威胁。虽然他们最后仍然失败了，但这里却提出了一个新问题：今后由于加强对富裕中农资本主义思想的斗争，加强社外自发倾向的限制，富裕中农的大部分将继续留在社内，他们的斗争方法将主要不是采取退社的办法，而是采取在社内争取领导权的方法。这是一个非常值得注意的问题。要教育全体社干和贫农下中农，我们一方面要批判富裕中农的资本主义思想，在社内团结他们搞好生产，一方面又必须坚持贫农的领导优势，警惕富裕中农争夺领导权的活动。
    白土乡试点中充分暴露了当前农村党、团组织和党、团员思想认识、工作作风的严重问题，要在组织建设中很好的加以整顿。要在党内、团内深入进行社会主义的阶级教育和纪律教育。对于在大鸣大放大争中少数立场动摇、观点错误和违法乱纪、脱离群众的党团员，应严格进行批评教育，个别情节严重而又不肯改正错误的，应予严肃处理。
    现在，中乡社和下乡社已经结束大鸣大放大争，改选了社委，并在此基础上进行制定明年生产规划，切实搞好“三包”和贯彻粮、油、猪生产任务包干、清理财务公布账目和调整生产组织改善经营管理等工作。　（原载南方日报本报有删节）
