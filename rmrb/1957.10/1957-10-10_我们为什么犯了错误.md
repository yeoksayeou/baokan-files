Why We Made Mistakes
“Manhua” Editorial Department

In the previous period, the "Manhua" (Cartoon) bi-monthly published many erroneous works, with the issues published in May and June being particularly prominent and serious. When the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party and the socialist system, we not only failed to fight back in time, but instead published the rightists' malicious works and a large number of works echoing the rightists' fallacies, spreading poison among the broad masses of readers. As the editorial staff in charge of this front, we lost our class stand and committed serious political errors.

What Bad Cartoons Were Published

In issue 89, we published "The Encounter of a Flower" by the rightist Shen Tongheng. This set of drawings maliciously attacked the editorial departments of various newspapers and periodicals under the leadership of the Party, slandered the Party's literary and art policies, and attempted to provoke authors' dissatisfaction with and opposition to the Party's leadership of literary and art work.

In issue 91, we published "Inspection Notes," a series of paintings by the rightist Li Binsheng, and "At a Certain University," a collaboration between Li Binsheng and Wang Fuxiang. The paintings "Developing Pig Breeding" and "Award System" contained toxins, while the author's anti-Party and anti-socialist stance was even more blatant in the painting "One Person Holding Two Posts."

In issues 90 and 92, we published two sets of "Ditty Paintings" by Liao Bingxiong, who had serious rightist words and deeds.

In issue 90, we also published "Arouse 'Vigilance'" by Wang Letian, "Movie Exhibition: Old Films Re-edited" by Tian Yuan, and "Preventing the Spread of 'Slip of the Tongue Syndrome'" by Liu Xiaoqing. In issue 91, we published "Newly Edited Complete Version of Black Whirlwind" by Ma De, "Dedicated Telephone" by Ke Ming, "Six Fans" by Tian Yuan, "Drawing Instrument Symposium" by Zhang Wenqi and Ren Zuoyu, and "Child's Cry" by Liu Lude and Zhou Yuequan. These works echoed the fallacies of the rightists on various issues. Some slandered the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, judicial work, personnel work, and literary and art work; others one-sidedly distorted and attacked the leaders and senior cadres of certain departments, with a serious nature of inciting discord between superiors and subordinates.

In issues 90 and 91, we also published many erroneous remarks with one-sidedness and inflammatory nature made by cartoonists in the early stage of the rectification campaign. We did not criticize these erroneous remarks either.

During the period when we published the above-mentioned many erroneous manuscripts, no editorial board meeting was held. Therefore, the responsibility for publishing these erroneous works should be borne by the editor-in-chief and the editorial department.

In early June, with the concern and criticism of the Party and the masses, we began to wake up and gradually realized the seriousness of our mistakes. We made a preliminary self-criticism in the 93rd issue of "Manhua". Of course, that self-criticism now seems to be extremely superficial. Later, we continued to conduct self-examination within the editorial department in order to correct our stand, transform our thinking, and improve our work.

Some comrades have already made in-depth and fair criticisms of these toxic works, and many readers have also criticized them in their letters to our editorial department. In the future, the "Manhua" bi-monthly will continue to展开展开[unfold] criticisms. Here we want to specifically examine the errors in our editorial work and why we released these poisonous weeds without criticism.

Specific Manifestations of Right-leaning Thought

Our country has entered socialism economically, but our thinking has not been thoroughly transformed and has not kept up with socialism. For a long time, bourgeois right-leaning thought has been reflected in our editorial work and creative practice. In general, its specific manifestations are two aspects: (1) In domestic criticism, one of our main targets was directed at socialist construction and leaders at all levels. Although we verbally support socialism, we often searched for "shortcomings" in the new society in editing, composing and creating, and mistakenly regarded satirizing the "shortcomings" of the new society as a way of loving the new society. Of course, if we can find the shortcomings correctly and make correct criticisms of the shortcomings, so as to eliminate these shortcomings, that is also a good thing; but due to the influence of the bourgeois stand, we made wrong satires of phenomena that should not be satirized. Building a new society is extremely difficult and complex, and certain individual shortcomings and deviations are inevitable in the process of progress; they are shortcomings in the process of victory. For example, in newly built and expanded industrial areas, workers' welfare undertakings cannot keep up with the needs of development for a while, and the lack of service industries caused by the increase in urban population. For these situations, we did not stand on the position of truly loving and safeguarding the new socialism to make a comprehensive analysis and understanding, but rudely carried out so-called "criticism" and "satire". This is essentially distorting the new society from the bourgeois standpoint. We have also mostly made unfavorable exaggerations, renderings, and uglifications of certain shortcomings of leading cadres at all levels. Some paintings depict them as relying on "official seals" to do things, liking pomp, putting on airs, serious coercion and commandism, being high above the masses and detached from the masses, and disregarding the sufferings of the masses. This kind of criticism is obviously one-sided and largely smears, which will arouse readers' dissatisfaction with the new society and leaders at all levels. (2) At the same time, we have relaxed our efforts against the main obstacles to building socialism—various reactionary thoughts and behaviors of the bourgeoisie. In the process of socialist construction, the bourgeois reactionaries try every possible means to undermine socialist construction and resist reform; various bourgeois ideas such as individualism, liberalism, departmentalism, absolute egalitarianism, and harming others to benefit oneself, laziness, corruption, violation of laws and disciplines, etc., still exist in large numbers around us. It is these bad ideas and bad styles that are trying to prevent socialism from moving forward, but we have not fully attacked them. Sometimes there is criticism, but it is also weak and powerless. From the above two points, we can clearly see the serious errors in our editorial policy, which made the "Manhua" magazine fail to play its due positive role in socialist construction. It is precisely because of the long-term existence of this bourgeois right-leaning thought that we were not politically alert in the face of the anti-Party fallacies spread by the rightists, and even mistakenly regarded poisonous weeds as fragrant flowers.

We also mistakenly believed that the reason why the cartoon business has not reached the expected prosperity is mainly because there is too much and too strict criticism of cartoon works, which makes authors have concerns about creation. Therefore, when the Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," we did not express welcome from the correct perspective, but from the wrong perspective, believing that since we want to let a hundred flowers bloom and prosper, we must encourage writers to create by publishing more, and less criticism is better, for fear that criticism will affect creation and prosperity. Our wrong understanding of the policy is contrary to Chairman Mao's principle that "mistakes must be criticized and poisonous weeds must be fought." This is not conducive to the people, to socialist construction, and to the true development of cartoon art.

After the rectification campaign began, authors from all over the country put forward many opinions to various newspapers and periodicals and the "Manhua" editorial department. Most of them were correct, but many were incorrect or even ulterior motives. The editorial department took an unprincipled conciliatory attitude towards certain authors, thinking that this could encourage their creative enthusiasm. Obviously, this is a lack of class struggle concept and an extremely irresponsible attitude towards the socialist cause.

The Bourgeois Stand Must Be Thoroughly Examined and Criticized

The above are just a few of the main aspects of the reasons for our mistakes. From these reasons for the mistakes, it fully proves that continuing to thoroughly transform ourselves has become an urgent problem.

We are now continuing to examine our wrong stand and the wrong direction of the magazine under the leadership of the Party organization of the Chinese Artists Association. We believe that only after we stand on the right position and distinguish between right and wrong can we thoroughly liquidate our bourgeois cartoon views so that "Manhua" can correctly serve socialism under the leadership of the Party. We ask readers to continue to supervise and help us, and at the same time, we hope that cartoon authors will correctly use this weapon and improve this magazine with active creation.

### 我们为什么犯了错误

    我们为什么犯了错误
    “漫画”编辑部
    在前一个时期，“漫画”半月刊上发表了不少有错误的作品，5、6月间出版的几期，表现得特别突出和严重。当资产阶级右派分子向党、向社会主义制度作疯狂进攻的时候，我们不但没有及时进行反击，相反地刊出了右派分子恶毒的作品和大量与右派分子谬论相呼应的作品，在广大读者中散布了毒素。作为掌握这一阵地的编辑部人员来说，我们是失掉了阶级立场，在政治上犯了严重的错误。
    刊登了些什么坏漫画
    在八十九期上，我们刊出了右派分子沈同衡所作的“一株花的遭遇”。这套画，恶意地攻击在党领导下的各报刊编辑部，诬蔑党的文艺政策，企图挑起作者对编辑部的不满和反对党对文艺工作的领导。
    在九十一期上，我们又刊出了右派分子李滨声所作的“视察随笔”的一套组画和李滨声、王复祥合作的“在某大学里”。组画中“发展养猪”、“评奖制度”等画都含有毒素，而在“一身二任”一幅画上，作者的反党、反社会主义立场更为露骨。
    在九十、九十二期上，我们刊出了有严重右派言行的廖冰兄的两套“打油词画”。
    在九十期上，我们还刊出了王乐天所作的“引起‘警惕’”、田原所作的“电影展览旧片新编”和刘小青所作的“预防流行‘失言症’”。在第九十一期上，刊出了马得所作的“新编全本黑旋风”、柯明所作的“专用电话”、田原所作的“六把扇子”、张文祺和任佐予合作的“绘图仪器座谈会”和刘路得、周月泉合作的“儿啼”等，这些作品在各种不同问题上均与右派分子的谬论相呼应。有的污蔑肃反工作、司法工作、人事工作和文艺工作，有的片面地对某些部门的领导人和高级干部进行了歪曲和攻击，带有严重的挑拨上下关系的性质。
    在第九十期和第九十一期上我们还刊出了漫画家们在整风初期所发表的许多带有片面性和煽动性的错误言论。对于这些错误言论，我们也没有进行批判。
    在我们刊出上列许多错误稿子的期间，没有召开过编委会，因此，发表这些错误作品的责任，应该由主编和编辑部负责。
    6月初，在党和群众的关怀与批评下，我们才开始清醒过来，逐渐认识了我们错误的严重性。我们在第九十三期的“漫画”上作了初步检讨。当然那个检讨现在看来是极不深刻的，以后又在编辑部内部继续进行检查，以求端正立场、改造思想、改进工作。
    关于这些含有毒素的作品，已经有同志对它们作了深入的、公正的批判，许多读者在给我们编辑部的来信中也对它们进行了批评。今后，在“漫画”半月刊上也还要继续展开批判。在这里我们想专门来检查我们编辑工作方面的错误，我们为什么无批判地放出了这些毒草。
    右倾思想的具体表现
    我国在经济上已进入了社会主义，但我们的思想并没有得到彻底改造，并没有跟着进入社会主义。长期以来，资产阶级右倾思想一直反映在我们的编辑工作和创作实践中。总的说来，它的具体表现有两方面：（一）在国内批评中，我们的主要矛头之一是针对社会主义建设及各级领导干部的。虽然我们口头上拥护社会主义，但在编辑组稿和创作中却经常在找寻新社会的“缺点”，并且把讽刺新社会的“缺点”错误地看成是爱护新社会的一种行为。当然，倘我们能够把缺点找对了，对缺点进行正确的批评，从而消灭这种缺点，那也是好事情；但由于资产阶级立场作祟，我们曾对不应该讽刺的现象进行了错误的讽刺。建设新社会是极其艰难而复杂的，在前进过程中发生某些个别的缺点与偏差是不可避免的，它们是属于胜利过程中的缺点。如在新建和扩建的工业地区，工人生活福利事业一时赶不上发展的需要，城市人口增加所引起的服务性行业的不足等等，对于这些情形，我们没有站在真正爱护和保卫新生的社会主义的立场上来加以全面的分析和认识，却粗暴地进行了所谓“批评”与“讽刺”。这实质上即是站在资产阶级立场歪曲了新社会。对于各级领导干部的某些缺点，我们也多半作了非善意的夸大、渲染与丑化。有些画把他们描写成是靠“印把子”办事、爱排场、摆大架子、严重的强迫命令、高高在上脱离群众、不顾群众疾苦等等。这种批评显然是片面的，在很大程度上带有诬蔑性，会挑起读者对新社会及各级领导干部的不满。（二）与此同时，我们对建设社会主义的主要障碍——资产阶级的各种反动思想和行为却放松了。在社会主义建设过程中，资产阶级反动派千方百计地破坏社会主义建设，违抗改造；各种各样资产阶级思想像个人主义、自由主义、本位主义、绝对平均主义以及损人利己、好逸恶劳、贪污腐化、违法乱纪等等在我们周围还大量存在着。正是这些坏思想、坏作风，在企图阻止社会主义前进，可是我们对它们没有进行全力进攻。有时虽有批评，但也是软弱无力的。从以上两点，就可以清晰地看出我们编辑方针上的严重错误，使“漫画”这一刊物在社会主义建设中未能起它应有的积极作用。正因为这种资产阶级右倾思想的长期存在，在右派分子散布的反党谬论面前，我们在政治上谈不到有所警惕，甚而错误地把毒草当作香花了。
    我们还错误地认为漫画事业之所以没有达到预期的繁荣，主要是对漫画作品批评过多、过严，使作者在创作上有顾虑。因此，当党提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策时，我们不是从正确的角度上来表示欢迎，而是从错误的角度上来表示“欢迎”，认为既要齐放繁荣，就要以多发表来鼓励作家创作，批评则愈少愈好，深怕批评会影响创作和繁荣。我们对政策的这种错误理解，正与毛主席指示我们“有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争”的原则相违背。这是不利于人民、不利于社会主义建设、不利于漫画艺术真正发展的。
    整风开始后，全国各地作者对各报刊及“漫画”编辑部提出了很多意见。其中大部分是正确的，但也有不少是不正确的，甚至是别有用心的。编辑部就对某些作者采取了无原则的迁就态度，认为这样可以鼓励他们的创作热情。显然这是毫无阶级斗争观念，对社会主义事业抱了极不负责的态度。
    资产阶级的立场必须彻底检查批判
    以上仅仅是我们犯错误的原因中几个主要的方面，从这些产生错误的原因来看，充分证明了继续彻底改造我们自己已成为迫不及待的问题。
    现在我们正在中国美术家协会党组织领导下继续检查我们的错误立场和刊物的错误方向。我们认为，也只有在我们站对了立场、分清了大是大非之后，才能彻底清算我们的资产阶级漫画观点，使“漫画”在党的领导下，正确地为社会主义服务。我们请读者继续监督和帮助我们，同时我们希望漫画作者们正确地运用这一武器，以积极创作来改进这一刊物。
