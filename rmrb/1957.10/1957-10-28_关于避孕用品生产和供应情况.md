    On the Production and Supply of Contraceptives
    Question: Since contraception is an urgent need for married men and women, what is the current production of contraceptives, and can it meet the needs of people in urban and rural areas?
    Answer: The production of contraceptives is expanding year by year. In the early days of Liberation, there were only two types: condoms and flat vaginal diaphragms (also known as cervical caps), and production was very small. In 1952, only 180,000 condoms and 3,200 flat vaginal diaphragms were produced. This year, not only has the variety increased to eight types (and six newly developed varieties are about to go into production), but also the output has increased significantly. For example, it is estimated that 45 million condoms, 300,000 vaginal diaphragms, and 1.95 million tubes of contraceptive cream will be produced this year.
    Product quality is also improving year by year. For example, contraceptive cream can kill sperm in 18 minutes, and Jianle Honey (contraceptive cream) can kill sperm in 28 minutes, both slightly higher than the standard. The elongation rate and breaking force of condoms are better than imported products.
    Question: Where can I buy contraceptives?
    Answer: The contraceptive supply network is gradually forming in urban and rural areas. At present, in addition to the complete operation of the pharmaceutical company system, department stores, trade, medicinal materials companies, supply and marketing cooperatives above the district (township) level, and some medical units have also concurrently operated or acted as agents. For example, in Hebei Province, only nine households operated contraceptives in 1955, which has increased to 3,500 households this year. In Tianjin, there were only 78 households in 1955, which has increased to 257 households this year. The operating varieties have increased from four in the past to the current seven, and the supply quantity has also increased rapidly. It is estimated that in Hebei Province in 1957, condoms sold to rural areas will account for about 40% of the total sales, and contraceptive suppositories will account for about 30% of the total sales.
    Question: Are contraceptives expensive or cheap?
    Answer: In order to reduce the burden on users, commercial departments have repeatedly reduced the price of contraceptives, basically adopting the principle of non-profit operation. For example, taking December 1954 as the base, by September 1957, the overall price level of the four types of contraceptives had dropped by more than 50%. Taking condoms as an example, the price of domestic products has dropped from 12 cents to 5 cents each, and the price of imported products has also dropped from 15 cents to 8 cents; contraceptive suppositories have also dropped by 17%.

    关于避孕用品生产和供应情况
    问：避孕既然是已婚男女的迫切要求，目前避孕用品的生产情况怎样，能否满足城乡人民的需要？
    答：避孕用品的生产正在逐年扩大。解放初期，只有阴茎套、平型阴道隔膜（又称子宫帽）两种，产量很小，1952年仅生产阴茎套十八万个，平型阴道隔膜三千二百个。今年，不仅品种已增加到八种（还有新制成功的六种新品种即将投入生产），而且产量也有很大的增长。如：阴茎套预计今年可生产四千五百万个，阴道隔膜可生产三十万个，避孕药膏可生产一百九十五万支。
    产品质量也在逐年改进，如避孕药膏在十八分钟内可以杀死精子，健乐蜜（避孕霜）在二十八分钟内可以杀死精子，都略高于标准。阴茎套的伸长率和扯断力都优于进口品。
    问：避孕用品到哪里去买？
    答：避孕用品供应网正在城乡各地逐渐形成。目前除医药公司系统已全部经营外，百货、贸易、药材等公司，区（乡）以上的供销社以及部分医疗单位也多已兼营或代销。如河北省1955年经营避孕用品的只有九户，今年增到三千五百户。天津市1955年只有七十八户，今年增到二百五十七户。经营品种由过去的四种增加到现在的七种，供应数量也迅速增长。河北省1957年预计销往农村的阴茎套即约占销售总数的40％，避孕拴约占销售总数的30％。
    问：避孕用品的售价是贵还是贱？
    答：为了减轻使用者的负担，商业部门曾数次降低避孕用品的售价，基本上采用了无利经营的原则。如以1954年12月为基数，到1957年9月为止，四种避孕用品的价格水平总的降低了50％以上。以阴茎套为例，国产品每个由一角二分降为五分，进口品也由一角五分降为八分；避孕拴也下降17％。
