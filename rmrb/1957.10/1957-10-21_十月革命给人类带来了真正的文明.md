    The October Revolution Brought True Civilization to Humanity
    Zhou Jianren
    The October Socialist Revolution was an exceptionally great revolution, unparalleled by any revolution in history. The socialist revolution changed human history, completely transforming human society and the face of humanity. Engels once said:
    "Man finally separates himself from the animal kingdom, leaves conditions of animal existence behind him and enters conditions which are really human. … The objective forces that have hitherto dominated history pass under the control of man himself. Only from that time will man himself make his own history fully consciously; only from that time will the social causes set in motion by him have in the main and in a constantly growing measure, the results intended by him. It is the ascent of man from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom."
    What a tremendous leap! Man breaks away from barbaric conditions of existence, enters truly human conditions of existence, and man becomes truly civilized. As everyone knows, transforming private ownership into public ownership through socialist revolution is a very significant reform, liberating people from the system of human enslavement and exploitation; from then on, production becomes socialist production, no longer for personal gain, but for the benefit of the public, no longer for a few to improve their lives, but for the majority to improve their lives.
    Although the "remuneration" of laborers in socialist society is still called wages, it is completely different in nature from wages under private ownership. Socialist society has no labor power buying and selling relationship; the wages earned are merely the share of the value obtained from socialist production distributed to the laborers as living necessities. Once this principle is understood, laborers will know that to improve their living standards, they must first improve production and increase social wealth. In socialist society, there are only organizations and leaders who lead the construction of socialism; there are no employers who buy labor power. It is impossible to maintain one's wage level by striking or slowing down work against capitalists as in the old society. All laborers in socialist society must consciously work hard and produce to improve the living standards of everyone; only then can their own living standards be improved. From then on, labor becomes something one should do and enjoys doing. Therefore, social production can be continuously improved and enhanced.
    Freedom and happiness are what everyone seeks. So-called freedom and happiness mainly refer to obtaining and satisfying material and cultural needs. Socialist revolution is the necessary means to achieve these goals, and through socialist revolution, civilization is unprecedentedly elevated. In the past, people often divided the degree of civilization into three levels: barbarism, semi-civilization, and civilization. And people often classified capitalist society and its people as civilized. In fact, in the capitalist stage, although machinery has developed, only the proletariat has begun to advance towards civilization. Only through socialist revolution can society and people reach a truly civilized stage.
    When Western capitalism began to rise, bourgeois theorists once praised science and reason, but as it declines today, their "theorists" conversely despise reason and science. They believe that reason is not only insignificant but practically useless. As for natural science, they only use it for the benefit of a few and for methods of destroying people. They insult scientific truth, even saying that knowledge is unreliable. Only through socialist revolution can science and reason truly be valued. In general, the socialist revolution has greatly elevated humanity, enabling it to enter a truly civilized stage: not only in the material aspect of the mechanization, electrification, and atomic energy of the means of production, but also in the ideological, emotional, and behavioral aspects, unprecedented improvement and progress are achieved.
    The principle is very clear and easy to understand: through the socialist revolution, private ownership is changed to public ownership, and the relationship between people changes from mutual struggle, deceit, and plunder to common interests. Not only within the same nation does mutual strife turn into friendship and mutual assistance, but among fraternal nationalities, previous oppression and encroachment are reversed into friendship and mutual assistance. The previous feelings of suppression and jealousy disappear, replaced by the idea of enthusiastically helping less developed nations, helping them to progress rapidly, and everyone sharing a high level of culture.
    When people mention the degree of civilization, they always feel that barbarians are more cruel and civilized people are more kind. The socialist revolution can indeed make people become kind and amiable.
    A few years ago, I also held a part-time position in Zhejiang. Once, the provincial government invited a Soviet expert and his family to dinner, and I accompanied them. One of those present was a boy of about seven years old. He saw a plate of drunken shrimp in the dishes, and some of the shrimp were still struggling. At first, he showed a look of unease, then he took a large bowl of clear water, put the still living shrimp in the clear water to wash off the soy sauce, and said: I want to save them, to raise them well. Of course, socialism does not advocate abstaining from killing and releasing living beings. Not at all. However, socialist education has changed the boy's habit of abusing small animals. Many people have seen this habit in children in the old society. This summer, I met a zoologist in Kunming who told me that a certain zoo, in order to make the beasts live healthier and be able to reproduce in their cages, would give them live feed (rabbits and chickens, etc.) every few days. However, someone raised an objection, saying that seeing the terrified and trembling state of these small animals when they fell into the mouths of the tigers was very uncomfortable, and suggested stopping this method (meaning that scientists should think of other ways to ensure the health of the tigers). This shows that the Chinese working people have indeed become more kind and amiable. Of course, this is absolutely not similar to the idea of abstaining from killing and releasing living beings.
    This explains that through the socialist revolution, people can become truly civilized people. The truly equal nationality policy of socialist countries, as well as the leadership's prohibition of actions that insult personal dignity in China's recent anti-rightist struggle, also illustrate this point, but this has no similarity whatsoever to the so-called pacifism or non-resistance of loving one's enemies as friends in the old society. The peaceful, kind people in the new society will definitely be stronger and more thorough in the struggle against the enemy.
    Through the socialist revolution, the constraints on the development of material production are removed, and the constraints on the development of spirit and body are also removed. Along with the development of mechanical tools and other tools for producing goods, everyone can develop comprehensively and freely. Each person's emotions, fantasies, ways of thinking, and views on life (outlook on life) change with different eras and different classes. Under socialism, undoubtedly, there will be great changes, greater progress and improvement, becoming noble, peaceful, open-minded, bright, pure, loving, and enthusiastic human beings. Taking the conceptual system as an example, the concepts contained in the conceptual system of people in the old society often contain superstitious, ignorant, and absurdly erroneous elements. The conceptual system of people in socialist society gradually becomes scientific, and each concept no longer contains the above-mentioned nature but is correct scientific knowledge. People of this era no longer present the qualities of autocracy, dogmatism, foolishness, and so on, but become wise, scientific, understand other people's thoughts, understand their own thoughts, and are truly able to conduct self-criticism.
    The socialist revolution has such great significance. It makes humanity progress, it makes humanity become truly civilized human beings, a humanity that is very different from animals other than human beings. Although the rise of capitalism in the past was also a revolution against feudalism and once had a certain degree of progressiveness (but it became reactionary and backward later), compared with the socialist revolution, it is insignificant; because the latter has the aforementioned effects or even more than that.
    The development of society is a historical necessity. Social systems before socialism will eventually be changed to the socialist system. Since the victory of the Russian October Revolution forty years ago, haven't many countries on earth already become socialist countries?
    However, historical necessity in human society is not without the need for human effort. The strong organization of the revolutionary party, the correct leadership of the revolutionary leaders, and the determined struggle of the revolutionary masses are all very important. The Soviet working people, the Communist Party, and the Party leader Lenin, as early as forty years ago, were the first to "cut through thorns and briars" and open up the road of socialism for all of humanity. Later, all ethnic groups advanced along this path. Not only is the Chinese revolution a continuation of the October Revolution, but in fact, the revolutions in all countries in the socialist camp cannot but be a continuation of the October Revolution. Therefore, while commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, everyone will inevitably warmly celebrate the greatness and victory of the Soviet Communist Party!

    十月革命给人类带来了真正的文明
    周建人
    十月社会主义革命是特别伟大的革命，历史上的革命没有可以与它比拟的。社会主义革命改变了人类的历史，使人类社会与人类的面貌完全改观。恩格斯曾经这样说过：
    “人在这时——在某种意义上是最终地——脱离了动物界，并从野蛮的生存条件过渡到真正人的生存条件。……从来一直统治着历史的客观异己势力，现在要受人们本身管制。只是从这时候起，人们才开始完全自觉地自己创造自己的历史。只有到那时候，由他们所发动起来的社会原因才在很大的和日益增长的程度上达到他们所预期的结果。这是人类从必然王国进入自由王国的飞跃”。
    这是何等巨大的飞跃。人从野蛮的生存条件脱离出来，进入真正人的生存条件，人也成了真正文明的人。大家都知道，通过社会主义革命，把私有制改变成为公有制，这是非常重大的改革，从此把人从人奴役人、人剥削人的制度中解放出来；从此生产成了社会主义的生产，不再是为个人的私利，而是为了社会公众的利益，不再是为了少数人提高生活，而是为大多数人提高生活了。
    社会主义社会里劳动者的“报酬”虽然仍然称为工资，但与私有制下面的工资性质已完全不同。社会主义社会没有劳动力的买卖关系，所得的工资只是社会主义生产所得的价值中分配给劳动者应得的生活资料。知道了这一点道理之后，劳动者从此知道要提高自己的生活标准首先须要提高生产和增加社会财富。社会主义社会中只有领导建设社会主义的组织与领导人，已没有购买劳动力的顾主，不可能用旧社会里向资本家罢工怠工的方法来维持自己的工资水平，一切社会主义社会的劳动者只有自觉地努力工作，努力生产，以提高大家的生活水平，自己的生活水平才能在其中得到提高。从此劳动变成为自己应做的事情，也是乐干的事情了。因此社会生产能不断地提高增进。
    自由与幸福本是人人所企求的东西。所谓自由幸福主要不外指物质要求和文化要求的获得与满足。社会主义革命就是达到这些目的的必要手段，通过社会主义革命，文明也就空前地提高。往日人们常把文明程度分野蛮、半开化和文明三级。并且往日常把资本主义社会和其人归在文明的一类。实际上在资本主义阶段里，机器虽已有发展，但讲到人则只有无产阶级才开始进于文明。只有通过社会主义革命，社会和人才到真正文明的阶段。
    西洋资本主义在开始兴起的时候，资产阶级的理论家虽然也曾经推崇过科学与理性，但到了日趋没落的今日，他们的“理论家”就相反地蔑视理性与科学了。他们认为理性不但无足轻重，简直没有什么用处。对于自然科学，则只用于为少数人牟利和毁灭人的方法里，他们侮蔑科学真理，竟说知识靠不住。只有通过社会主义革命，才真正给予科学与理性以重视。总的说来，社会主义革命，把人类大大地提高了，使人类进入真正文明的阶段：不只是物质方面生产手段机械化、电气化和原子能化，在思想、情操、行为方面也得到空前地提高与进步。
    道理是非常明白易解的：通过社会主义革命，私有制改为公有制，人与人之间的关系由个人之间彼此斗争、欺诈、抢夺，变为利害相共同。不仅在同民族中由互争变为友好、互助，在兄弟民族间也一反以前的压迫、侵夺，变为友好、互助了。以前压抑、嫉视的心情没有了，只有热心帮助较落后的民族的思想，帮助他们迅速进步，大家共有高度的文化。
    人们一提起文明程度，总觉得野蛮人比较残酷些，文明人比较和善些。通过社会主义革命确实能叫人变为慈祥与和蔼。
    前几年我曾在浙江兼职。有一次省政府请一位苏联专家和他的家眷吃饭，由我作陪。同来的有一位大约七岁左右的男孩子。他看到菜肴中有一盘醉虾，有些虾还在挣扎。他起初现出不安的神色，随后去取了一大碗清水来，把还活着的虾放在清水里洗去酱油，口里说着：我要救活它们，把它们好好养起来。当然，社会主义不会主张戒杀放生的。完全不是。不过社会主义教育已改变了男小孩爱虐杀小动物的脾气。旧社会的小孩有此脾气是许多人都看到过的。今年夏天我在昆明遇到一位动物学家，他告诉我某动物园因为欲使猛兽在槛内生活更健康和能生育，隔几天给予一次活饲料（兔及鸡之类）。但是有人来提意见，说看了这些小动物落在老虎口边时那种惊恐颤栗之状，令人很不舒服，建议停止此种办法（意思也就是说要保证老虎的健康应由科学家想别的办法）。这说明中国劳动人民实在已变得更慈祥、和善了。当然，这与戒杀放生的思想是绝对没有相似之处的。
    这就是说明通过社会主义革命，人能成为真正文明的人。社会主义国家的真正平等的民族政策，以及中国最近反右派斗争中领导上不允许有侮辱人格的行动，也说明了这一点，但这与旧社会里所谓和平主义或爱敌如友的无抵抗主义没有丝毫近似之处。新社会里的和平、慈祥的人在对敌斗争里一定是更坚强、彻底的。
    通过社会主义革命，解除了对物质生产发展上的束缚，同时也解除了对精神、身体发展上的束缚。与生产物品的机械工具之类发展同时，每个人都能全面地和自由地发展起来。各人的情操、幻想、思想方法，人生见解（人生观）本是随着不同的时代、不同的阶级而变化的，在社会主义之下无疑的要发生大变化，要更进步与提高，成为高尚、安祥、通达、光明、纯洁、友爱、热情的人类。拿观念体系来说，旧社会的人的观念体系里所包含的观念常常含有迷信、愚昧、荒谬错误的成分，社会主义社会里的人的观念体系就渐渐科学化，每个观念不再含有以上所讲的性质而是正确的科学知识了。这时代的人不再有专制、独断、愚妄等等性质的呈现，而成为明智的、科学的，了解别人的思想，也了解自己的思想，和真正能进行自我批判的人了。
    社会主义革命有如此重大的意义。它使人类进步，它使人类成为真正文明的人类，与人类以外的动物显得十分不同的人类。虽然过去资本主义开始兴起时，对封建主义也是一种革命，也曾经有过一定的进步性（发展到后来则成为反动落后），但和社会主义革命相比，卑不足道；因为后者具有前述的作用或者还不止此。
    社会的发展是历史的必然性，社会主义以前的社会制度，终必改变为社会主义制度，自从四十年前俄罗斯十月革命胜利以来，不是地球上已有许多国家成为社会主义的国家了吗？
    不过历史的必然性，在人类社会里并不是不需要人的努力的。革命政党的坚强的组织，革命领导人的正确的领导，与革命群众的坚决奋斗，都是十分重要的。苏联劳动人民，共产党，党的领导人列宁，早在四十年前给全世界人类首先“披荆斩棘”地开辟了社会主义的道路，以后的各民族就踏着这路子前进。不仅中国革命是十月革命的继续，事实上社会主义阵营里各国的革命也都不可能不是十月革命的继续。因此，我们在纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命四十年纪念日的同时，大家必然热烈地庆祝苏联共产党的伟大与胜利！
