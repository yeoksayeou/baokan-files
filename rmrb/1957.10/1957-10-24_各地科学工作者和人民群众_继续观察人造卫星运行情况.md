Xinhua News Agency Report: Scientific workers and the broad masses of people across our country are continuing to observe the operation of the Soviet artificial Earth satellite with great interest and a cheerful mood.

From October 12th to 22nd, Shenyang, Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Lhasa, and other places have successively seen the artificial Earth satellite or the rocket carrying the artificial Earth satellite.

At around 18:00 on the 22nd, the rocket carrying the artificial satellite passed over Nanjing, Beijing, and other places. Many scientific workers, office staff, and citizens saw the rocket at the scheduled time through scientific instruments and with the naked eye. The Zijinshan Observatory in Nanjing successfully photographed the rocket carrying the artificial Earth satellite and accurately recorded the azimuth and altitude of the rocket's operation using a theodolite. Scientific workers used a 15-centimeter refracting telescope and an ordinary camera to photograph the operation of the rocket. They took a total of four shots, and the light of the rocket left obvious linear traces on three of the negatives. The Zijinshan Observatory in Nanjing had previously photographed the rocket carrying the artificial Earth satellite for the first time through the observatory telescope from 18:15 to 19:10 on the 21st.

Prior to this, scientific workers and the people across our country had repeatedly seen the artificial Earth satellite and the carrier rocket.

At 21:13 on the 12th, three meteorological workers in Shenyang City used a new theodolite and binoculars to see the artificial Earth satellite passing over Shenyang. At 5:25 on the morning of the 14th, meteorological workers in Shenyang City once again saw a moving star passing over Shenyang, but it was estimated that this might be the carrier rocket walking in front of the artificial Earth satellite.

On the 15th, many scientific workers and citizens in Beijing also saw the artificial Earth satellite.

According to the announcement from Moscow, the time when the artificial satellite passed over Beijing on the 15th was 5:31, so before dawn on the 15th, many people in Beijing got up early specifically to watch the Soviet artificial Earth satellite. Some observers used many telescopes to observe. At 5:20:30, more than 80 people used 7-8x telescopes to observe a small star moving from a slightly westward direction in the north, passing through the middle of the Big Dipper constellation (Ursa Major), towards the southeast direction. The starlight was light red and did not disappear until 5:24. At the same time, many office staff and citizens also saw the star moving from the northwest direction to the southeast direction.

At 5:11 on the morning of the 17th, observers from the Zijinshan Observatory in Nanjing and the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy of Nanjing University simultaneously saw the rocket carrying the artificial Earth satellite flying over Nanjing from two observation points. The observation team of the Zijinshan Observatory had seventeen people who saw the rocket with the naked eye, and the observation team of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy of Nanjing University had thirteen people who saw the rocket with the naked eye.

Scientific workers and citizens in Guangzhou also saw the rocket carrying the artificial Earth satellite at 18:36 on the evening of the 19th and at 4:49 on the morning of the 20th.

At 19:59 on the afternoon of the 21st, more than thirty officers of the Tibet Military Region saw the artificial Earth satellite in the south of Lhasa with the naked eye. The artificial satellite began to appear in the southwest corner of Lhasa, gradually flowing towards the northeast corner, and was no longer visible until the line of sight was blocked by high mountains.

    各地科学工作者和人民群众
    继续观察人造卫星运行情况
    本报讯　综合新华社消息：我国各地科学工作者和广大人民群众正在怀着浓厚的兴趣，以愉快的心情继续观察苏联人造地球卫星的运行情况。
    从10月12到22日，沈阳、北京、南京、广州、拉萨等地都先后看到了人造地球卫星或运载人造地球卫星的火箭。
    22日十八时许，运载人造卫星的火箭通过南京、北京等地上空。许多科学工作者、机关工作人员和市民、分别通过科学仪器和肉眼在预定时间内看到了火箭。南京紫金山天文台成功地拍摄了运载人造地球卫星的火箭，并且用经纬仪准确地记录了火箭运行的方位角和高度。科学工作者们是用十五公分口径的折光望远镜和普通照像机拍摄火箭的运行情况。他们共拍摄了四片，在三张底片上火箭的光芒留下了显明的线状痕迹。南京紫金山天文台曾在21日十八点十五分到十九点十分，第一次通过天文台望远镜拍摄了运载人造地球卫星的火箭的照片。
    在这以前，我国各地科学工作者和人民群众曾多次看到了人造地球卫星和运载火箭。
    12日二十一时十三分，沈阳市有三个气象工作人员用新式经纬仪和双筒望远镜看到了通过沈阳上空的人造地球卫星。14日晨五时二十五分钟，沈阳市的气象工作人员又一次看到一颗移动着的星通过沈阳上空，但是据估计这可能是走在人造地球卫星前面的运载火箭。
    15日，北京市的许多科学工作者和市民群众也看到了人造地球卫星。
    根据莫斯科公布，15日人造卫星通过北京上空的时间是五点三十一分，所以15日黎明之前，北京就有很多人提早起床，专门等着看苏联人造地球卫星。一些观测人员用了许多望远镜进行观测。五点二十分三十秒，有八十多人用七到八倍的望远镜观察到一颗小星从北略偏西的方向，经过大熊星座（北斗）中间，向东南方向移动，星光呈淡红色，直到五时二十四分才消逝。在同一时间内，许多机关工作人员和市民也看了由西北方向向东南方向移动的星。
    17日晨五时十一分，南京紫金山天文台和南京大学数学天文系的观测人员在两个观测地点同时看到了运载人造地球卫星的火箭飞过南京上空。紫金山天文台的观测队有十七人用肉眼看到火箭，南京大学数学天文系观测队有十三人用肉眼看到火箭。
    广州市的科学工作人员和市民在19日晚六时三十六分和20日晨四时四十九分也分别看到了运载人造地球卫星的火箭。
    21日下午七时五十九分，西藏军区的三十多个军官用肉眼在拉萨南部看到了人造地球卫星。人造卫星开始出现在拉萨西南角，逐渐向东北角流动，一直被高山挡住了视线才看不见。
