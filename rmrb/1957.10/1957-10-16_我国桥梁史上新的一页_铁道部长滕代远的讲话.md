Comrades, friends:

　　The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is officially open to traffic today. This is another glorious victory for the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in carrying out socialist construction, and it is also the outstanding achievement of all the bridge construction workers. On behalf of the Ministry of Railways and all railway workers in the country, I would like to extend my heartfelt and warm congratulations to you!

　　Building a bridge over the Yangtze River has been a long-cherished wish of the Chinese people, but only after liberation, when the people became the masters of the country and under the leadership of the Communist Party, did this wish become a reality. In 1950, we started surveying and drilling work, and invited bridge experts to hold discussions three times, finally completing the preliminary design in May 1953. From May 1954 to January 1955, geological exploration work was repeatedly carried out to determine the scheme of building the foundation using the caisson method, and half a year of experimental work was carried out to complete the technical design. This scheme was approved by the Chinese government in July 1955, and the main bridge project officially started in September 1955. After two years and one month, the bridge was fully completed on September 25 this year. The long-standing expectations of the Chinese people have finally been realized. This fact fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of China's socialist system.

　　The opening of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will play an extremely important role in the development of China's national economy. The bridge connects the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Yuehan Railway, and integrates the three towns of Wuhan. Through the bridge, the railway network and highway network in the north and south of China are connected into a whole, establishing a reliable and regular connection between the north and south regions of China. This is of great significance for facilitating the exchange of materials between the north and south regions of China, developing the economy and culture of Wuhan, and providing a reliable guarantee for the transportation of the iron and steel base currently under construction in Central China. At the same time, after the bridge is opened to traffic, it will also play an extremely important role in improving our railway transportation work and shortening passenger travel time and cargo transportation time.

　　Because the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has such important national economic significance, it has received enthusiastic support from the people of the whole country during the construction process, especially the Party, government, military, and social organizations of Hubei Province and Wuhan City, which have provided timely leadership and assistance, and various brother departments and enterprises have provided strong support in various aspects. This provides an important guarantee for the smooth completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. On behalf of the Ministry of Railways, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Party, government, and military leading departments and social organizations of Hubei Province and Wuhan City, and to the central departments and brother enterprises!

　　In the process of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the experts sent by the Soviet government demonstrated a high degree of internationalism. They not only helped us build the bridge and carry out experimental work, but also trained a group of technical cadres and technical workers for us, enabling us to grow a new type of bridge construction team while completing the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. On behalf of the Ministry of Railways, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Soviet experts! My heartfelt thanks to Comrade Kozhevnikov, Minister of Transport Construction of the Soviet government, and the comrades of the delegation headed by him who are attending today's meeting! And through you, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude and brotherly respect to the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and the Soviet railway workers!

　　In the design and construction process of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, China's bridge engineering technicians and all the workers of the bridge have made painstaking efforts. Many veteran engineers and senior technicians have made outstanding contributions in design, construction, technical research, technical leadership, and training of technical cadres. Many young engineers have gained a lot from learning from Soviet experts and veteran engineers, improved their technical level, and been tempered in practical work. The bridge's workforce has more than doubled in the past few years, and their skills have also been continuously improved. In the construction process, many work teams have become advanced work teams, and many workers have become advanced producers. In the manufacturing and assembly of steel caissons, in the manufacturing and sinking of pipe columns, in the splicing and riveting of steel beams, in the manufacture and use of various giant machines, and in other various processes, they improved the construction organization and improved the operation methods, thereby greatly improving the labor rate. This plays an extremely important role in accelerating the progress of the bridge, improving the quality of the bridge project, and saving the construction costs of the bridge. On behalf of the Ministry of Railways, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the engineers who participated in the design and construction of the bridge, to all the workers of the bridge, and to the advanced work teams and advanced producers of the bridge!

　　The completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has opened a new page in the history of bridge construction in China, marking a significant improvement in the technical level of bridge engineering in China. I hope that bridge construction workers will guard against arrogance and impetuosity, continue to work hard, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and continue to move forward on the basis of the victories already achieved, and strive to complete the task of building new bridges more, faster, better, and more economically.

### 我国桥梁史上新的一页  铁道部长滕代远的讲话

　　我国桥梁史上新的一页
    铁道部长滕代远的讲话同志们、朋友们：
    武汉长江大桥今天正式通车了。这是我国人民，在中国共产党领导下，进行社会主义建设的又一次光辉胜利，也是修建大桥的全体职工同志们的卓越成果。我谨代表铁道部和全国铁路职工向你们致以衷心的、热烈的祝贺！
    在长江上修建大桥，是我国人民长远以来的愿望，但只有在解放以后，人民作了国家的主人，在共产党领导下，才使这个愿望变成了现实。1950年我们就开始了测量钻探工作，并且三次邀请桥梁专家开会讨论，终于在1953年5月完成了初步设计。1954年5月到1955年1月，又反复进行了地质勘探工作，确定了以管柱钻孔法修建基础的方案，并进行了半年的试验工作，完成了技术设计。这个方案，在1955年7月，经我国政府批准以后，1955年9月大桥正桥工程正式开工。经过两年零一个月的时间，大桥在今年9月25日全部建成。我国人民长久以来的殷切期望终于实现了。这个事实充分说明了我国社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    武汉长江大桥的通车，对我国国民经济的发展将起着极为重要的作用。大桥将京汉铁路和粤汉铁路衔接了起来，将武汉三镇联成了一体。通过大桥，使我国南北地区的铁路网和公路网联成为一个整体，建立了我国南北地区可靠的和经常的联系。这对便利我国南北地区的物资交流，发展武汉市的经济和文化，都有重大意义，并对我国正在建设的华中钢铁基地，提供了运输上的可靠保证。同时，大桥通车以后，对改善我们的铁路运输工作，缩短旅客旅行时间，和货物的运送时间，也起着极为重要的作用。
    由于修建武汉长江大桥有这样重大的国民经济意义，因此，在大桥修建过程中，得到了全国人民的热烈支持，特别是湖北省和武汉市的党、政、军和社会团体，给予了及时的领导和帮助，各兄弟部门和兄弟企业，从各方面给予了大力支援。这就给武汉长江大桥顺利建成，提供了重要保证。我谨代表铁道部，向湖北省、武汉市党、政、军领导部门和社会团体，各中央部门和兄弟企业致以衷心的感谢！
    在修建武汉长江大桥的过程中，苏联政府派来的专家们表现了高度的国际主义精神。他们不仅帮助了我们修建大桥和进行试验工作，而且为我们培养了一批技术干部和技术工人，使我们在完成修建武汉长江大桥的同时，成长起来了一支新型的建桥队伍。我谨代表铁道部向苏联专家们致以衷心的感谢！向参加今天大会的苏联政府运输建设部长科热夫尼科夫同志及以他为首的代表团的同志们致以衷心的感谢！并通过你们，向苏联政府、苏联人民和苏联铁路员工致以诚挚的感谢和兄弟般的敬意！
    在武汉长江大桥的设计和施工过程中，我国的桥梁工程技术人员，和大桥的全体职工，付出了辛勤的劳动。很多老工程师和高级技术人员在设计、施工、技术研究、技术领导和培养技术干部方面，作出了卓越的贡献，很多年青工程师在向苏联专家和老工程师学习方面，有了很大收获，提高了技术水平，并在实际工作中得到了锻炼。大桥的工人队伍，几年来增加了一倍以上，他们的技术也不断有所提高。在施工过程中很多工班变成了先进的工班，很多工人变成了先进生产者。他们在钢围囹的制造和拼装方面，在管柱的制造和下沉方面，在钢梁的拼铆和焊接方面，在各种巨型的机械制造和使用方面，以及在其他各种工序方面，改善了施工组织，改进了操作方法，因而大大地提高了工率。这对加速大桥的进度，提高大桥工程的质量，和节约大桥的修建费用，起着极为重要作用。我谨代表铁道部向参加大桥设计和施工的工程师们，向大桥的全体职工同志们，向大桥的先进工班和先进生产者致以衷心的感谢！
    武汉长江大桥的建成，在我国桥梁史上揭开了新的一页，它标志着我国桥梁工程技术水平已经有了很大的提高。希望建桥职工戒骄戒躁，继续努力，学习苏联的先进经验，在已经取得胜利的基础上，继续前进，为更多、更快、更好、更省地完成修建新桥任务而努力。
