Xinhua News Agency, New York, 26th: The publisher of the "New York Times," Sulzberger, sent a message during his visit to Taiwan, believing that the Chiang Kai-shek clique had reached the end of the road. The message, published in the "New York Times" foreign affairs column on October 19th, stated: Taiwan "has all sorts of problems that are on the verge of erupting. The politicians (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique members) are getting older and older. Chiang himself is already seventy years old. There are fewer younger or middle-aged officials who escaped here with him."

Sulzberger discussed the military and economic situation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, saying: "Economically, the future is bleak. With our (American) consent, Chiang maintains a disproportionately large armed force. Without substantial American aid, this army would not be able to exist." The message stated that three-quarters of Taiwan's income is used for military expenses. Taiwanese youths who have been conscripted now account for about 35% of all Chiang's troops. The morale of Chiang's troops is low.

The "New York World-Telegram and Sun" also published a Taipei dispatch on October 19th, stating that the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities are facing a serious crisis—a spiritual crisis. Reporter Sparks continued: Since Chiang Kai-shek led his remaining troops to flee the mainland in 1949, Sparks himself has always visited Taiwan regularly. He has "never seen the morale of Chiang's troops as low as it is now. The old tune of launching a counterattack to return to the mainland in the vague future has long been played out. People no longer believe in this."

Sparks said that he has a friend who is a naval officer in Chiang's army. Once, when he heard the radio broadcasting a "counterattack" speech again, the Chiang's army officer turned off the radio and said: "It's really insulting! The government (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique) must think we are all fools."

    蒋介石集团日暮途穷
    美国记者报道访问台湾印象
    据新华社26日讯  纽约消息：“纽约时报”发行人苏兹贝格在访问台湾时发出一条消息，认为蒋介石集团已经到了日暮途穷的地步。刊载在10月19日“纽约时报”外交栏上的这条消息说：台湾“这里的种种问题一触即发。政治家们（指蒋介石集团分子）愈来愈老了。蒋本人已经七十岁了。同他一起逃到这里的年资较轻或中年的官员较少。”
    苏兹贝格谈论蒋介石集团的军事和经济说：“从经济上说，前途茫茫。蒋在我们（美国）的同意下维持着一支大得不相称的武装部队。没有美国的大量援助，这支军队便无法存在。”消息说：台湾的收入四分之三作为军费。被强征入伍的台湾籍青年，目前在全部蒋军中约占35％。蒋军士气低落。
    “纽约世界电讯与太阳报”在10月19日也发表了一条台北电讯说：台湾国民党当局面临着一个严重的危机——精神上的危机。记者斯巴克斯接着说：自从1949年蒋介石带领残余军队逃离大陆以后，斯巴克斯本人总是定期访问台湾，他“从来没有看到蒋军士气有过现在这样的低落。在渺茫的明天将发动反攻回到大陆这句话早已成了老调。人们不再相信这一套了。”
    斯巴克斯说，他有一个朋友是蒋军海军军官，有一次听到收音机又在广播“反攻”演说，这个蒋军军官就关上收音机说：“真侮辱人！政府（指蒋介石集团）一定以为我们全是蠢货。”
