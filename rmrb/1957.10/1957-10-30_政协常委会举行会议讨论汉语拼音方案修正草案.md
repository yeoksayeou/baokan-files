Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held its enlarged 49th meeting on the morning of the 29th. Members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Examination and Revision Committee attended today's meeting.

    The meeting held a heated discussion on the revised draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. Speakers at the meeting pointed out the many benefits of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet in learning Chinese characters and promoting Putonghua, and expressed their agreement with the scheme. This revised draft will be submitted to the State Council for deliberation and approval before implementation.

    The revised draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme discussed at today's meeting is based on the "Draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" published by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee in February 1956. The Chinese Writing Reform Committee made preliminary revisions in August 1956 based on opinions from various parties, and then the State Council's specially established Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Examination and Revision Committee conducted the examination and revision work. It was unanimously passed at the committee's meeting on October 16th of this year. This Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is designed to facilitate the learning of Chinese characters, promote Putonghua, and eliminate illiteracy, and its main function is to provide phonetic notation for Chinese characters. Prior to today's meeting, members of the Standing Committees of the CPPCC and the NPC, as well as experts in writing and linguistics, held group discussions and discussed the revised draft. They unanimously expressed their agreement with the revised draft and hoped that it would be implemented as soon as possible.

    The meeting decided to add one Deputy Secretary-General to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and decided that Zhang Zhiyi would assume the post.

    政协常委会举行会议讨论汉语拼音方案修正草案
    新华社29日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会29日上午举行扩大的第四十九次会议。全国人民代表大会常务委员会、中国文字改革委员会和汉语拼音方案审订委员会的委员列席了今天的会议。
    会议对汉语拼音方案修正草案进行了热烈的讨论，在会上发言的人指出了汉语拼音对学习汉字和推广普通话等方面的许多好处，表示同意这个方案。这个修正草案将经国务院全体会议审议批准后执行。
    今天的会议讨论的汉语拼音方案修正草案，是以中国文字改革委员会在1956年2月发表的“汉语拼音方案草案”为基础，经中国文字改革委员会根据各方面提出的意见在1956年8月作了初步的修正，然后又经国务院专门设立的汉语拼音方案审订委员会进行了审订工作，在审订委员会今年10月16日的会议上一致通过的。这个汉语拼音方案是为了便于学习汉字、推广普通话和扫除文盲而制订的，它的作用主要是为汉字注音。在今天的会议以前，政协和人大的常务委员及文字语言学的专家曾分组座谈，对修正草案进行了讨论。他们一致表示同意这个修正草案，希望能尽快地付诸实行。
    会议决定中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会增设副秘书长一人，决定由张执一担任。
