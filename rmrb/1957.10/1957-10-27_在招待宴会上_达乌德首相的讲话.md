    At the Banquet
    Prime Minister Daoud's Speech
    Mr. Premier, I am very pleased to thank Your Excellency and other distinguished guests for attending this friendly banquet.
    Your presence gives me another opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese government and people for the hospitality they have extended to me and my companions during our stay in Beijing.
    Everything we have seen in our friendly neighbor China has indeed been very beneficial to me and my companions. The achievements made by the Chinese government and people in all aspects are worthy of congratulations and make me very happy.
    The industriousness and striving spirit of the Chinese people is the fundamental reason for China's progress and success. This spirit is the inherent talent that the Chinese people have shown at various times in history. It can be seen that the current life of the Chinese people and their ancient traditions, which they are proud of, are well connected.
    I am very pleased that the sincere and friendly contacts I established with Your Excellency and other leaders of the Chinese government during my visit to Beijing have helped me to better understand the thoughts and aspirations of the Chinese people.
    I hope that through this visit and with the continued strengthening of the friendly cooperation between our two governments, beneficial results will be achieved in realizing the common aspirations of the people of Afghanistan and China to strengthen mutual friendship and amity.
    We are very touched by the feelings expressed by the Chinese people towards the Afghan people. I assure Your Excellency that the Afghan people hold the same feelings towards the Chinese people.
    I am sure that in expressing my gratitude for the hospitality and friendly feelings shown to us by the Chinese people, I am expressing the feelings of the Afghan people and also adding my personal good wishes.
    I raise my glass to the health of His Excellency Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China and His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China, and wish the friendship between Afghanistan and China long live, and world peace long live.

    在招待宴会上
    达乌德首相的讲话
    总理先生，我非常高兴地感谢阁下和其他尊敬的人士来参加这次友好的宴会。
    阁下的光临给我又一次机会来对中国政府和人民在我和我的同伴们逗留北京期间所给予我们的款待表示衷心的感谢。
    我们在我们的友好邻邦中国所看到的一切，对于我和我的同伴们确实是很有益的。中国政府和人民在各方面所取得的成就是值得祝贺的，并且使我看了很高兴。
    中国人民的勤劳和努力的精神，是中国之所以获得进步和成功的基本原因。这种精神也就是中国人民在历史上若干不同时期曾经表现过的固有的才能。由此看出，中国人民目前的生活和他们引为骄傲的古老传统是很好地连系起来的。
    我在北京访问期间同阁下和中国政府其他领导人所建立的诚挚的和友好的接触，帮助我对中国人民的思想和愿望有了更好的了解，这是十分令人高兴的。
    我希望通过这一次访问和随着我们两国政府间友好合作关系的继续加强，在实现阿中两国人民加强相互友谊和亲睦的共同愿望方面，将会取得有益的结果。
    中国人民所表示的对于阿富汗人民的感情，使我们很感动。我向阁下保证，阿富汗人民对于中国人民也抱着同样的感情。
    我确信，我在对中国人民所给予我们的款待和友好感情表示感谢的时候，我是表达了阿富汗人民的心情，并且也加上了我个人的良好愿望。
    我举杯祝中华人民共和国主席毛泽东阁下和中华人民共和国总理周恩来阁下的健康，并祝阿中两国友好万岁，世界和平万岁。
