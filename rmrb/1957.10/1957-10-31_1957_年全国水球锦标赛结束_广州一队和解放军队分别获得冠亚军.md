    1957 National Water Polo Championship Concludes
    Guangzhou Team One and PLA Team Win First and Second Place Respectively
    (Our Newspaper's Dispatch) The 1957 National Water Polo Championship concluded yesterday. In the finals held from the 26th to the 30th, Guangzhou Team One won the championship with an outstanding record of five wins in five matches. The PLA team won four matches and lost one in the five matches, taking second place. Xiamen Team, Guangzhou Team Two, Tianjin Team, and Shanghai Team won the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth places respectively.
    The match between Guangzhou Team One and the PLA team on the 30th evening was the last and most exciting battle of this championship. Before this match, neither team had lost a single game. The players of Guangzhou Team One were skilled in individual techniques, had good endurance, and were fast. Their teamwork was also excellent, thus maintaining a constant winning record. The PLA team was brave and tenacious, with good endurance and speed, and had been invincible in previous matches. This time, the encounter between the two powerhouses, and who the championship would belong to, was a matter of great concern to the audience.
    At the start of the match, both sides launched fierce attacks against each other. However, in a situation of evenly matched strength, both teams shot at the goal eight or nine times in the first seven or eight minutes, but either the goalkeeper saved the ball, or it was shot out of bounds. The seesaw battle lasted for a long time. Two minutes before the end of the first half, a PLA team player committed a foul by pulling a player in the penalty area. Guangzhou Team One was awarded a four-meter penalty, and a player from Guangzhou Team One scored, giving the PLA team its first goal conceded. The first half ended with a score of 1-0.
    In the second half, the teams switched sides and resumed the battle. Guangzhou Team One, with the momentum of victory, became more and more courageous. The PLA team also fought bravely to counterattack. Three minutes into the half, Guangzhou Team's number three player committed a foul by pressing a player, and was sent off the field. At this time, Guangzhou Team One had only six players on the field (each team has seven players). The PLA team, with its numerical advantage, pressed all the way to the goal of Guangzhou Team One. Guangzhou Team One adopted a dense defensive tactic in front of the goal, attempting to protect their goal at all costs, but in the end, due to the lack of personnel, they were unable to make up for the loopholes in the defense, and the PLA team scored a goal. The score was tied. The center line kick-off resumed the battle. Guangzhou Team One used their speed advantage to launch another fierce attack. Although the PLA team had already pulled back a goal, the team's coordination was not good, and there were many passing errors. Therefore, the attack was not as brave and powerful as before. In addition, due to negligence and errors in defense, they conceded two goals in the last five or six minutes. As a result, Guangzhou Team One defeated the PLA team by a score of 3-1.
    Before the match between Guangzhou Team One and the PLA team, Xiamen Team and Guangzhou Team Two played a match. This was a match to compete for the third and fourth places. The two sides fought fiercely in the match, resulting in a 2-2 draw. In previous matches, the two teams had the same points, but Xiamen Team had a higher total score than Guangzhou Team Two, so they took third place, and Guangzhou Team Two took fourth place.
    Vice Premier of the State Council He Long watched last night's match and presented awards to the top three teams in this championship.

    1957年全国水球锦标赛结束
    广州一队和解放军队分别获得冠亚军
    本报讯　1957年全国水球锦标赛昨天结束。在从26日到30日的决赛中广州一队以五战五胜的优异成绩夺得了锦标；解放军队在五场比赛中胜了四场，败了一场，得亚军。厦门队、广州二队、天津队和上海队分别获得第三、四、五、六名。
    30日晚广州一队对解放军队的比赛是这次锦标赛中的最后一仗，也是最精彩的一仗。这两队在这次比赛以前谁也没有输过一场。广州一队的队员个人技术熟练，耐力好，速度快，队员相互间默契也好，因此保持常胜不败的纪录。解放军队勇猛、顽强，耐力、速度也都很好，故在以前比赛的几场中所向披靡。这次两雄相遇，锦标究竟属谁，是观众们非常关心的事。
    比赛开始，双方即互相展开猛攻，但在势均力敌的情况下，在前七八分钟内两个队虽都射了八九次大门，但不是被守门员扑住，就是射出界外，拉锯战相持了很久。到上半时结束前两分钟，解放军队队员在禁区拉人犯规，由广州一队罚四公尺球，广州一队队员一射中门，解放军队先失一球。上半时以一比零结束。
    下半时，易地再战。广州一队挟着战胜的余威，愈战愈勇，解放军队也奋勇反攻。在三分钟时广州队三号压人犯规，被判罚出场外，这时广州一队在场上只剩下六个人了（每队七人）。解放军队以人力上的优势，全力压到广州一队门前，广州一队采取了门前密集防守战术，企图力保大门，但终因人少，无法弥补防守上的漏洞，被解放军射入了一球。双方纪录一平。中线开球再战，广州一队利用他们速度上的优势，又展开猛攻。解放军队虽已扳回一球，但全队配合不佳，传球又多失误，因此在进攻上就不像以前那样勇猛有力了，再加上防守上的疏忽和错误，在最后的五、六分钟内连失两球。结果广州一队以三比一胜解放军队。
    在广州一队和解放军队比赛之前，厦门队和广州二队作了一场比赛。这是争夺第三、四名的一场比赛，比赛中双方争夺得很剧烈，结果二比二平局。在以前的比赛中，这两队积分相等，但厦门队得球总和比广州二队多，故取得了第三，广州二队得第四。
    国务院副总理贺龙观看了昨晚的比赛，并给这次比赛的前三名发了奖。
