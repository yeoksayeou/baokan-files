    Cai Yanji is a Vendor of "Zhang-brand" Poison
    The industrial and commercial circles in Xiamen have exposed Cai Yanji, a rightist element referred to as a vendor of "Zhang Naiqi's poison," who is the vice chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, chairman of the Xiamen Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and vice mayor of Xiamen.
    Cai Yanji did his utmost to slander and attack the working class. He said: The working class in Xiamen is worse than the capitalists. The working class has two sides and is more backward than the capitalists. Workers are not qualified to lead capitalists at all. Cai Yanji also advocated that the relationship between public and private should not be mentioned in joint ventures, but the relationship of working together should be emphasized.
    Cai Yanji slandered the three major transformation policies in many ways. He said that agricultural cooperatives have no superiority; the unified purchase and sale of grain made farmers have no food to eat; handicraft industry cooperation is a "complete mess"; the "four horses divide the fat" policy is "four horses divide the fat and one horse is thin (referring to the bourgeoisie)"; state-owned enterprises are not run well and are "not worth a penny." Cai Yanji wantonly attacked the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries movement, collecting tinder materials everywhere; he clamored to "settle accounts" with the court. He said, "Democratic people should be like Li Kui, the Black Whirlwind, on Liangshan Mountain, swinging double axes, and not like Lin Daiyu in the Grand View Garden, living under someone else's roof." He incited others to attack the Party. Cai Yanji also arrogantly threatened those who exposed him. All this further exposed Cai Yanji's reactionary face, making the broad masses even more indignant and determined to wage a resolute struggle against him.

    蔡衍吉是章记毒品贩卖者
    厦门市工商界揪出一个人们称之为章乃器毒品的贩卖者、福建省工商联副主委兼厦门市工商联主委、厦门市副市长右派分子蔡衍吉。
    蔡衍吉极力对工人阶级施以诋毁和攻击。他说：厦门的工人阶级比资本家还坏。工人阶级有两面性，比资本家更落后。工人根本没有资格领导资本家。蔡衍吉还主张在合营企业中不要提公私关系，而应强调共事关系。
    蔡衍吉对三大改造政策多方进行诬蔑。他说农业合作社没有优越性；粮食统购统销搞得农民没饭吃；手工业合作化是“一团糟”；四马分肥政策是“四马分肥一马瘦（指资产阶级）”；国营企业办不好，“一文钱不值”。蔡衍吉大肆攻击肃反运动，到处搜集点火材料；扬言要和法院“清算”。他说“民主人士要做梁山泊上的黑旋风李逵抡起双斧，不要做大观园中的林黛玉寄人篱下。”煽动别人向党进攻。蔡衍吉还嚣张地威胁揭发他的人。这一切更加暴露了蔡衍吉的反动面目，使得广大群众更加愤慨，一致和他进行坚决斗争。
