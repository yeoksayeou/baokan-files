    Changchun (By our correspondent) More than 300 cadres transferred downward in Changchun's local industry and handicraft systems have strengthened workshop forces and promoted production.

    This group of cadres began returning to production posts in April. Among them were section chiefs, division chiefs, union chairmen, workshop directors, and ordinary cadres. In their production posts, most of them were able to learn modestly and work hard, and they also took the initiative to conduct ideological work among the workers, encouraging everyone's enthusiasm for production and better completion of tasks. Zhao Congwen, chairman of the Changchun Gas Company's trade union, was originally the leader of the watch repair team. During his time in the watch repair team, the team's production performance was excellent and was rated as the company's model team. From 1953, Zhao Congwen and several skilled workers were transferred out to become cadres, reducing the team's technical strength, causing ideological confusion among the workers, and creating disunity among them, which affected production. In 1956, this team frequently produced rework items and failed to complete its tasks. In June of this year, Zhao Congwen took the initiative to return to the team and still served as the team leader. Under his leadership, the team established a democratic life meeting to strengthen ideological education work, the workers united, and production improved. He also led everyone to repair damaged watches, saving a large amount of materials. Feng Lian'gui, a cadre of the Changchun Food Factory's supply and marketing section, returned to the bread team as an ordinary worker. Seeing that some workers in the team were lax in labor discipline and the team could not complete the task on time, he explained to the workers the relationship between the team's production tasks and the factory and the national plan, encouraging everyone to work harder and complete the plan on time.

    长春工业系统下放干部在生产中起模范作用
    本报讯  长春市地方工业、手工业系统下放了三百多名干部，加强车间力量，推动了生产。
    这批干部是从4月份开始先后回到生产中去的。他们之中有科长、股长、工会主席、车间主任和一般干部。他们在生产岗位上，大部分人都能虚心学习，努力生产，并且在工人中还主动地进行思想工作，鼓动大家的生产情绪，更好地完成任务。长春市煤气公司工会主席赵从文，原来是修表小组的组长，他在修表小组的时期，小组生产成绩优异，被评为公司的模范小组。从1953年起，赵从文和几个技术工人先后被调出当了干部，组内技术力量减少，工人思想混乱，彼此之间闹不团结，影响了生产。1956年，这个小组经常出返修品，完不成任务。今年6月，赵从文主动要求回到小组，仍然担任小组长。在他领导下，小组建立了民主生活会，加强了思想教育工作，工人之间团结了，生产也有好转。他还带动大家把残破的表修好，节约了大量材料。长春市食品厂供销科干部冯连贵，回到面包组当了普通工人。他看到组内有些工人劳动纪律松懈，小组不能按时完成任务，他便和工人们讲解小组生产任务和工厂以及国家计划的关系，鼓动大家加紧干活，按时完成了计划。
