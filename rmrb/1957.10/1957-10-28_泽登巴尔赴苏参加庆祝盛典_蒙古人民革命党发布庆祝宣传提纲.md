Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 25th - A propaganda outline published in Ulaanbaatar on the 25th regarding the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution stated that the Mongolian people are smoothly building socialism along the path indicated by the October Revolution.

This propaganda outline, drafted by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Party History Research Institute, expounds on the world significance of the October Revolution and focuses on the impact of the October Revolution on the Mongolian People's Revolution and the achievements Mongolia has made in construction with the help of the Soviet Union.

The outline states that Mongolia's national liberation struggle broke out under the direct influence of the October Revolution. With the help of Soviet Russia, Mongolia achieved victory in its people's revolution. The Mongolian people, following Lenin's teachings, are taking the non-capitalist path to socialism. The Soviet Union selflessly helped Mongolia in the economic, technical, and human resources fields, enabling Mongolia to begin to have industry, transportation, and a national working class.

The outline states that at a time when the enemies of communism are attacking Marxism-Leninism with capitalist and revisionist viewpoints, attempting to undermine the unity of the working class, the Party is required to further strengthen ideological unity and resolutely adhere to the proletarian internationalist ideology.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 27th - Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and head of the Mongolian People's Republic delegation participating in the 40th anniversary celebration of the October Socialist Revolution, left Ulaanbaatar by plane for Moscow at 10:00 this morning.

The four members of the delegation, Damba, First Secretary of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party; Sürenjav, Second Secretary; Yangjima, member of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural; and Tumurchul, will travel to Moscow in early November.

    蒙古人民革命党发布庆祝宣传提纲
    据新华社乌兰巴托25日电　乌兰巴托25日公布的伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的宣传提纲说，蒙古人民正在沿着十月革命所指引的道路顺利地建设社会主义。
    这篇由蒙古人民革命党中央宣传部和党史研究所拟订的宣传提纲阐述了十月革命的世界意义，并且着重讲述了十月革命对蒙古人民革命的影响和在苏联帮助下蒙古在建设中所取得的成就。
    提纲说，蒙古的民族解放斗争是在十月革命的直接影响下爆发的，在苏维埃俄罗斯的帮助下，蒙古取得了人民革命的胜利。蒙古人民遵照列宁的学说，走非资本主义的道路进入社会主义。苏联在经济、技术和人力方面无私地帮助蒙古，使蒙古开始有了工业、交通运输业，并且产生了民族的工人阶级。
    提纲说，在共产主义的敌人利用资本主义和修正主义的观点向马克思列宁主义进攻，企图破坏工人阶级团结的时候，要求党进一步加强思想团结，坚决忠于无产阶级的国际主义思想。
