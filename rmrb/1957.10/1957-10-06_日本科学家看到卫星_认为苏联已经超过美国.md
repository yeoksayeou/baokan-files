Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch, Tokyo: Japanese scientists today believe that the Soviet Union's successful launch of an artificial satellite is another victory over the United States in science. Dr. Harada, a famous Japanese scientist, said that the United States had been worried that the Soviet Union would surpass the United States in launching artificial satellites. Now the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States.

Astronomer Dr. Masaji Miyaji, head of the Tokyo Observatory, said that judging from the size of the artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union, it can be said that the Soviet Union has accomplished a feat that will be recorded in history in the field of science.

According to the latest news, Japanese scientists have seen the Soviet Union's artificial satellite. NHK announced today that it has received radio signals from the Soviet Union's artificial satellite.

Japanese newspapers tonight published the news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of an artificial satellite in a prominent position, which forced the newspapers to reduce the space for news about the meeting between the Japanese Prime Minister and Indian Prime Minister Nehru.
