In the past, in the deep mountains of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province, there was a saying: "When the millet turns golden, malaria climbs into bed." In severe cases, the rice was left on the mountains, and no one went to harvest it. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government sent medical workers to carry out three to four years of work to eliminate malaria. Currently, more than twenty mountain villages have basically eliminated malaria. (Attached picture)

    湘西二十多个山寨消灭疟疾
    从前，湖南湘西土家族苗族自治州一带的深山里，流传着“谷子金黄、摆子（疟疾）上床”的谚语。严重的时候，稻谷就被丢在山上，没有人去收割。解放后，党和人民政府派来医务工作者，在这里进行了三、四年消灭疟疾的工作。目前已经有二十多个山寨基本上消灭了疟疾。（附图片）
