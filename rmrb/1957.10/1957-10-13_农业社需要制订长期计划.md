Agricultural Cooperatives Need to Develop Long-Term Plans
　　Nan Chen

What will the prospects for agricultural production development be in our country for a considerable period after agricultural collectivization? The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) has already sketched a magnificent blueprint for farmers across the country. Encouraged by this blueprint, since 1956, an unprecedented upsurge in production and construction has emerged in rural areas nationwide. Now, it is no longer just individual regions that have achieved the targets set by the program in terms of per unit area yield of grain and cotton.

The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) is a goal for every agricultural cooperative to strive for. How can this goal be achieved? This requires each agricultural cooperative to formulate a longer-term production and construction plan based on its specific environment and production conditions.

On the other hand, a well-defined and feasible long-term production plan can allow cooperative members to see their future in the development prospects of the cooperative, increase their confidence, and strive for even greater yields. For prosperous middle peasants, it can also help them recognize the superiority of collectivization and firmly take the socialist road.

The Hongxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Yangjingdi Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, recently formulated its second five-year plan. After the implementation of this plan, the per unit area yield of grain in the whole cooperative will increase from 400 jin to 600 jin, greatly exceeding the targets required by the National Agricultural Development Program, and the average income per cooperative member household can be 1,000 yuan per year. What an exciting plan!

Two years are about to pass since the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) was formulated. Now, the country's second five-year economic construction plan is about to begin implementation. We hope that every agricultural cooperative, like the Hongxing Cooperative, will first formulate its second five-year plan, so that every farmer can see the development prospects of the agricultural cooperative and encourage the vast number of members to launch a new production upsurge with greater enthusiasm and initiative.

　　农业社需要制订长期计划
　　南沉
    在农业合作化以后的一个相当长的时期内，我国农业生产的发展前景将会是什么样子？全国农业发展纲要（草案）已经给全国农民钩画了一幅灿烂的蓝图。在这幅蓝图的鼓舞之下，1956年以来，全国农村中出现了规模空前的生产建设高潮。现在，在粮食和棉花单位面积产量方面达到纲要规定的指标的，已经不是个别的地区了。
    全国农业发展纲要（草案）是每一个农业社努力奋斗的目标。怎样才能达到这个目标呢？这就需要每个农业社根据自己的具体环境和生产条件，制定一个较长时期的生产建设计划。
    另一方面，一个目标明确、而且切实可行的长期生产计划，对于合作社社员来说，可以从合作社的发展远景中看到自己的前途，增加信心，努力争取丰产再丰产。对于富裕中农来说，也能够帮助他们认识到合作化的优越性，坚定地走社会主义的道路。
    山西省平顺县羊井底乡红星农林牧生产合作社，最近制订了第二个五年计划，这个计划实现以后，全社的粮食单位面积产量将由四百斤提高到六百斤，大大超过全国农业发展纲要所要求的指标，平均每户社员每年可以有一千元的收入。这是一个多么令人兴奋的计划！
    全国农业发展纲要（草案）制定以来，两年的时间快要过去了。现在，国家的第二个五年经济建设计划就要开始执行。我们希望每个农业社都像红星社一样，先制订出第二个五年计划，让每个农民都看到农业社发展的远景，鼓舞广大社员以更大的热情和积极性掀起一个新的生产高潮。
