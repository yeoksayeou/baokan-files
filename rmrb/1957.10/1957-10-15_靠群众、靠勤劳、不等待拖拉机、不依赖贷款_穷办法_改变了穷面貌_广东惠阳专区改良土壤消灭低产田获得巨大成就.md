Editor's Note: Under the shining light of cooperativization, any impoverished rural area can be built into a prosperous and flourishing socialist home. There are endless tricks to construction, as long as the wisdom and talent of the working people are fully tapped; the power of construction is magnificent and immense, as long as the hard work, industrious collective strength, and the unwavering spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountains are fully utilized. Not being pessimistic in the face of poverty, not bowing to difficulties, not relying on state investment and loans, not waiting for modern technological forces, even with "poor methods" and "local methods," the face of poverty can be changed. The great achievements made by Huiyang Prefecture, Guangdong Province, in large-scale soil improvement are a typical example.

This newspaper reports that Huiyang Prefecture, Guangdong Province, known as a poor area, has developed the spirit of industrious production of Chinese farmers, without waiting for tractors and chemical fertilizers, without relying on state loans, but using revolutionary measures of relying on the masses, relying on labor, and relying on "local methods" and "poor methods" to improve the soil on a large scale, transform low-yield fields, and achieve preliminary victory in increasing grain production.

Huiyang Prefecture is a low-grain-producing area with a lot of land, barren soil, insufficient manpower, and severe natural disasters such as waterlogging, drought, wind, and tides. In order to get rid of the backward state of agricultural production, in recent years, the party and government leading organs of the prefecture have led farmers to take measures to increase production, such as building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, early sowing and early transplanting, and close planting with small seedlings, so that rice production increased from 2.48 billion jin in 1952 to 3.07 billion jin in 1956. Since 1956, the entire area has transferred nearly 400 million jin of rice to other areas, becoming one of the important grain-producing areas in Guangdong Province. However, the speed of grain growth is still not fast enough. The average yield per mu in the whole region is only 500 jin, and the average annual increase is only 5%. In order to achieve the requirement of 800 jin per mu by 1967, it is still necessary to speed up the increase in grain production.

In order to study the problem of accelerating the growth rate of grain production, the CCP Huiyang Prefectural Committee inspected the production of the whole region last winter and found that among the 7.2 million mu of rice fields in the region, 4.4 million mu had barren and hard soil, shallow soil layers, and lack of organic matter, with an annual output of only about 300 jin. Among these millions of mu of low-yield fields, there are sandy fields, dead mud fields, shallow-bottom fields, lake and ocean fields, saltwater fields, and rust water fields, and so on. After listening to the experience of old cooperatives and old farmers in transforming low-yield fields and conducting on-the-spot investigations into the fact that soil improvement significantly increased grain production, the CCP Huiyang Prefectural Committee believed that soil improvement was the most effective way to promote the increase in production of this type of low-yield field with little labor and large benefits.

This spring, a mass movement to improve soil and eliminate low-yield fields was launched throughout the region. Various places, based on the experience of old farmers and supplemented by technical guidance, adopted various methods for various low-yield fields, and achieved great results. In the spring and summer seasons, the region transformed a total of 1.68 million mu of low-yield fields, increasing a large amount of grain production. The six non-disaster-stricken counties of Huiyang, Dongguan, Baoan, Boluo, Lianping, and Heping transformed the soil of 558,000 mu of fields, increasing rice production by 410,000 dan, with an average increase of 73 jin per mu. This spring, Duguang Agricultural Cooperative in Huiyang County improved the soil of 364 mu of fields, with an average increase of 100 jin per mu. After improving the soil of Hefeng Cooperative's eight mu of dead mud fields, which originally produced only 250 jin per mu, the yield per mu reached 750 jin. The average increase in rice yield per mu in Lianping County over the past four years was 107.5 jin. This year, after improving the soil, the production potential was further tapped. The yield of early rice per mu increased by another 45 jin compared with the same period last year.

The fact that low-yield fields have generally and significantly increased production has won the active support of the masses of farmers for the soil improvement movement. The masses generally recognize that soil improvement has five major benefits: (1) improving soil quality, turning bad fields into good fields; (2) increasing fertility, turning low yields into high yields; (3) improving land utilization, turning two crops into three crops; (4) reducing costs and reducing commercial fertilizer; (5) softening the soil and improving labor efficiency. A Hakka mountain song in Zijing County sings: "Although soil improvement is hard work, in the Lesser Heat, cutting rice fills the granary." In the past, no one in Dahu Ocean Cooperative in Huiyang County was willing to "contract three fields" of lake and ocean fields. Now, seeing the increased harvest after improvement, everyone is rushing to contract farming.

The facts in Huiyang Prefecture show that soil improvement is a fundamental measure to change the backward state of production, and it is also a good way to run cooperatives diligently and thriftily. However, the soil improvement movement encountered many ideological obstacles at the beginning. Some people think that water conservancy construction can improve the soil, and some people think that accumulating fertilizer is improving the soil. They thought that the transformation of low-yield fields only requires water conservancy and fertilizer. Others were afraid that soil improvement would be in vain, saying that the soil is "born with bones and grown with meat," and believed that improvement work is "very complicated, very troublesome, and very difficult to handle." Some wealthy farmers, upon hearing about soil improvement, said, "It's so hard" and "It's so laborious," and they wholeheartedly wanted to wait for tractors and chemical fertilizers and wanted to rely on state loans, unwilling to put in more labor. Some people even suggested that soil improvement has a large chemical component, does not show results much, and increases income is limited. It is better to seize the opportunity to engage in sideline occupations, which are faster and more profitable. In order to break the ideological resistance to the soil improvement movement, the CCP Huiyang Prefectural Committee widely publicized the importance of soil improvement to the farmers and criticized the above-mentioned various erroneous thoughts. After the soil improvement was effective, many farmers said, "There are only lazy people, no lazy fields." They realized that as long as they worked hard, made efforts, and prescribed the right medicine, bad fields could definitely be turned into good fields.

In the soil improvement movement, agricultural cooperatives adopted various "local methods" and "poor methods," such as using pond mud, surge mud, green manure, rice stalks, and fine mud and sand to gradually change dead mud fields into loam fields; using methods such as ditching and draining, digging wells to block springs, introducing soil to replace mud, and applying a lot of soil and miscellaneous fertilizer to transform lake and ocean fields; carrying a lot of mud and green manure into sandy fields; deep plowing shallow-bottom fields and adding a lot of mud, miscellaneous soil fertilizer, and rice stalks; washing saline fields with fresh water, and so on. Agricultural cooperatives also particularly emphasized organizing more organic fertilizer and continuing to nourish the fields. Such as planting more green manure to nourish fields with fields; composting more mountain greenery to nourish fields with mountains; developing pig raising to nourish fields with livestock; using rice straw to nourish fields with stalks; digging more fertile mud to nourish fields with mud; and promoting sanitation and hygiene and composting to nourish fields.

Huiyang Prefecture will continue to vigorously carry out soil improvement work, and plans to transform low-yield fields in batches within three years, and strive to achieve an output of 800 jin of rice per mu of rice fields in the entire region before the completion of the Third Five-Year Plan.

　　靠群众、靠勤劳、不等待拖拉机、不依赖贷款
    “穷办法”改变了穷面貌
    广东惠阳专区改良土壤消灭低产田获得巨大成就
    编者按　在合作化的光辉照耀下，任何穷乡僻壤都可以建设成为富裕繁荣的社会主义家园。建设的窍门无穷无尽，只要充分挖掘了劳动人民的聪明才智；建设的力量宏伟巨大，只要充分发挥了劳动人民艰苦勤劳的集体力量和愚公移山的坚韧精神。在穷困面前不悲观，在困难面前不低头，不依赖国家的投资和贷款，不等待现代化的技术力量，就用“穷办法”“土办法”也可以改变穷困的面貌。广东省惠阳专区在大规模改良土壤方面取得了巨大成绩，就是一个典型的范例。
    本报讯　素称穷地区的广东省惠阳专区，发扬我国农民勤劳生产的精神，不等待拖拉机和化学肥料，不依赖国家贷款，而用靠群众、靠劳动、靠“土办法”和“穷办法”的革命性措施，大规模改良土壤，改造低产田，取得了粮食增产的初步胜利。
    惠阳专区是一个土地很多，土质瘦瘠，人手不足，水、旱、风、潮等自然灾害严重的粮食低产区。为了摆脱农业生产上的落后状态，几年来，专区的党、政领导机关领导农民采取了兴修水利、积肥、早播早插、小株密植等增产措施，使水稻产量从1952年的二十四亿八千万斤增长到1956年的三十亿七千万斤。1956年以来，全区已经外调稻谷近四亿斤，成为广东省重要产粮区之一。但是，粮食增长的速度还是不快，全区平均每亩产量仅为五百斤，每年平均只增产5％；要在1967年达到每亩产量八百斤的要求，还必须加快粮食增产的速度。
    为了研究加快粮食增产速度的问题，中共惠阳地委去冬检查了全区生产，发现全区七百二十万亩稻田中，有四百四十万亩的土质瘦硬、土层浅薄、缺乏有机质，每年产量只有三百斤左右。在这几百万亩低产田中，有沙质田、死泥田、浅脚田、湖洋田、咸水田和锈水田等等。中共惠阳地委在倾听了老社和老农改造低产田的经验和实地调查了改良土壤使粮食显著增产的事实以后，认为改良土壤是促使这一类低产田增产的费工小、收益大的最有效的办法。
    今年春天，全区开展了群众性改良土壤、消灭低产田的运动。各地以老农的经验为主，以技术指导为辅，对各种不同的低产田采取各种不同的办法，收到了很大的效果。春夏两季，全区共改造了低产田一百六十八万亩，增产了大量的粮食。惠阳、东莞、宝安、博罗、连平、和平等六县非灾区，共改良了五十五万八千亩田的土壤，增产稻谷四十一万担，平均每亩增产七十三斤。惠阳县读光农业社今年春季改良三百六十四亩田的土壤，平均每亩增收一百斤。禾丰社原来每亩只产二百五十斤的八亩死泥田，经过改良土壤以后，每亩产量竟达七百五十斤。连平县的稻田四年来平均每亩增产一百零七点五斤，今年改良了土壤，进一步挖掘了生产的潜力，上造水稻每亩比去年同期又增产四十五斤。
    低产田普遍显著增产的事实，使改良土壤运动得到了农民群众的积极拥护。群众公认改良土壤有五大好处：（一）改良土质，坏田变好田；（二）增加肥力，低产变高产；（三）提高土地利用率，两造变三造；（四）降低成本，减少商品肥；（五）土质松软，提高劳动效率。紫金县客家山歌唱道：“改良土壤虽辛苦，小暑刈禾满仓谷。”惠阳县大湖洋社的湖洋田，过去谁也不愿“三包”，现在看到改良后的收成提高，大家也抢着包耕了。
    惠阳专区的事实说明，改良土壤是改变生产落后状态的一项根本措施，也是勤俭办社的好办法。但是，改良土壤运动开始的时候遇到了不少的思想障碍。有人认为兴修水利就可以改良土壤，也有人认为积肥就是改良土壤。他们以为改造低产田只要有了水利和肥料就行了。还有人怕改良土壤会徒劳无功，说土壤是“生就的骨头长就的肉”，认为改良工作“很复杂、很麻烦、很难办”。有些富裕农民听到改良土壤，就叫“好辛苦”、“好费工”，一心想等待拖拉机和化学肥料，想依赖国家贷款，不愿多费劳动。甚至有人建议说，改良土壤化工大，见效不大，增加收入有限，不如抓紧搞副业，赚钱快又多。为了打破改良土壤运动的思想阻力，中共惠阳地委广泛向农民宣传了改良土壤的重要意义，批判了上述种种错误思想。改良土壤有成效后，很多农民都说，“只有懒人，没有懒田。”他们认识到只要劳动，肯下功夫，对症下药，坏田一定可以变成好田。
    在改良土壤运动中，农业社采取了各种“土办法”和“穷办法”，如用塘泥、涌泥、绿肥、稻秆和细泥沙，把死泥田逐步改为壤土田；用开沟排渍、挖井堵泉、入土换泥和大量施土杂肥等方法，改造湖洋田；把大量泥、绿肥挑入沙质田中；深耕浅脚田，并加入大量泥、土杂肥和稻秆；用淡水冲洗咸田，等等。农业社还特别强调多组织有机肥，继续养田。如多种绿肥，以田养田；多沤山青，以山养田；发展养猪，以畜养田；利用禾秆，以秆养田；多挖肥泥，以泥养田；多提倡清洁卫生，堆肥养田。
    惠阳专区将继续大力进行土壤改良工作，计划在三年之内把低产田分批改完，并争取在第三个五年计划完成以前，全区稻田每亩产稻谷达到八百斤。
