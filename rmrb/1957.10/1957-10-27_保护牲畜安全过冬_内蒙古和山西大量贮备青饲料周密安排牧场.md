Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is currently taking a series of concrete measures to vigorously solve the difficulties of livestock overwintering in pastoral areas.

　　In addition to storing a large amount of grass, various pastoral areas in the Autonomous Region have recently made careful arrangements for winter and spring pastures based on the growth of the grass. The Ulanqab and Bayannur regions were drier this year, and the grass growth was poor. A portion of the livestock lacked winter pastures. Local party and government leading organs and herdsmen worked together to open up new pastures for more than 700,000 livestock. Bayannur League borders Gansu Province. Gansu Province has freed up winter pastures for 30,000 livestock from this league, so that the livestock in these areas can basically safely overwinter. In pastoral areas such as Xilin Gol, Ikhao, and Chahar, winter pastures have also been adjusted and expanded between leagues and banners, according to the number of livestock and the living conditions of herdsmen. Herdsmen near agricultural areas, based on the condition of the livestock, drove more than 170,000 livestock unsuitable for grazing overwinter on the grasslands to agricultural areas to be fed by farmers, in order to reduce livestock losses.

　　In order to solve the water source problem in the newly opened pastures in various places, the Autonomous Region's Water Conservancy Department and Geological Bureau have recently sent a group of water conservancy work teams to help herdsmen build small-scale water conservancy projects. The Autonomous Region has also allocated a special fund for herdsmen to build water conservancy projects. At present, a large number of feeds are being transferred to various pastoral areas. This year, various places in the Autonomous Region have also allocated a large number of medicines to pastoral areas. Now, some areas have implemented free or reduced-price treatment for sick livestock. In order to solve the difficulties in winter and spring transportation and communication tools for herdsmen, the Autonomous Region recently allocated a batch of automobiles, rubber-wheeled vehicles, radiotelephones, and telegraph transmitters to the pastoral areas of Bayannur and Ikhao Leagues.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: Due to the autumn drought and grass shortage, farmers in Shanxi Province are generally storing green fodder for livestock to overwinter. By the beginning of October, the province had already collected more than 835 million catties of wild grass and silage corn stalks, enough for more than 500,000 livestock to eat during the winter.

　　In addition to storing winter fodder, agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas such as Taihang, Taiyue, and Lüliang, which have grazing conditions, have also changed the habit of not grazing on the mountains after "Frost's Descent" in previous years, extending the grazing time of livestock by about 50 days compared with previous years, in order to save winter fodder. During the grazing period, in Jin Northwest, which suffered more severe drought disasters, many agricultural cooperatives gave play to the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual relief, and after consultation, implemented methods of moving livestock to grass or short-term foster grazing to help disaster-stricken cooperatives solve the problem of insufficient livestock fodder. Agricultural cooperatives in counties such as Wutai, Guoxian, and Dingxiang alone have helped agricultural cooperatives in Xingxian, Hequ, Baode, and Kelan counties properly resettle more than 2,000 livestock lacking fodder. Some agricultural cooperatives in Xingxian and Baode counties have also signed friendly contracts for borrowing slopes for grazing and fostering draft animals, which can ensure the safe overwintering of more than 850 draft animals.

    保护牲畜安全过冬
    内蒙古和山西大量贮备青饲料周密安排牧场
    新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区目前正采取一系列具体措施，大力解决牧区牲畜过冬的困难。
    今年自治区各畜牧区除了储备大量青草外，最近各地根据牧草生长情况，对冬、春季牧场做了周密的安排。乌兰察布、巴彦淖尔地区今年较干旱，牧草生长差，一部分牲畜缺冬季牧场，当地党政领导机关和牧民共同为七十多万头牲畜，努力开辟了新的牧场。巴彦淖尔盟与甘肃省毗邻，甘肃省已为这个盟牧民腾出了三万头牲畜的过冬牧场，使这些地区的牲畜基本上可以安全过冬。锡林郭勒、伊克昭和察哈尔等牧区，根据牲畜多寡和牧民居住情况，盟与盟、旗与旗之间也都调整和扩大了冬季牧场。靠近农业区的牧民们，根据牲畜膘情，把不适宜在草原上放牧过冬的十七万多头牲畜，赶到农业区，同农民分喂，以减少牲畜的损失。
    为了解决各地新开辟牧场的水源问题，自治区水利厅和地质局，最近又派出一批水利工作队，帮助牧民兴修小型水利。自治区还给牧民发放了一笔兴修水利专款，目前，正向各牧区调运大批饲料。今年自治区各地还拨给牧区大量药品。现在，有的地区已实行免费或减价为牧民治疗病畜。自治区为解决牧民冬春运输和通讯工具中的困难，最近给巴彦淖尔、伊克昭盟牧区，增拨了一批汽车、胶轮车、报话机和收发电报机。
    新华社太原电　秋旱草缺，山西省农民正普遍为牲畜贮备过冬的青饲草。到10月初，全省已打集野草和青贮玉米秸秆八亿三千五百多万斤，足够五十多万头牲畜冬季食用。
    除了储备过冬饲草，太行、太岳、吕梁等山区有放牧条件的农业社，还改变了历年来“霜降”不上山放牧的习惯，把牲畜放牧时间比往年延长了五十天左右，以节省冬季饲草。在放牧期间，遭受旱灾较重的晋西北地区，有许多农业社发挥互助互济的精神，经过协商实行移畜就草或短期寄养放牧的办法，帮助受灾社解决牲畜饲草不足的问题。仅五台、崞县、定襄等县的农业社，就帮助兴县、河曲、保德、岢岚等县农业社妥善安置了两千多头缺乏饲草的牲畜。兴县、保德两县的部分农业社，还相互签订了借坡放牧和寄养耕畜的友好合同，可以使八百五十多头耕畜安全过冬。
