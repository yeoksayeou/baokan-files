    Paper cutting is a folk art.
    It is divided into two types: cutting and knife carving. Working people, especially women, universally love it. They use their artistic genius to create meaningful paper cuttings, such as window decorations, murals, clothing, shoes, hats, pillows, and embroidery patterns for clothing, sometimes using them to decorate gifts for relatives and friends. Although the lines of paper cutting art are very simple, they also contain the author's feelings. In the old society, because paper cutting was looked down upon by the literati, there are no written records or oral traditions about the era in which this art originated. However, due to the love of the broad masses of working people, it has been passed down from generation to generation to the present.
    After liberation, the Party and the government attached importance to preserving and developing folk art heritage, and advocated paper cutting art. Through the first National Folk Art and Craft Exhibition in 1953, paper cutting art received more attention from the audience, and the number of people learning and buying paper cuttings increased day by day. Later, it also participated in the art and craft exhibitions collected by the Art Service Department for exhibitions abroad, and the special paper cutting exhibitions sponsored by the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Liaison, which were exhibited in more than 20 countries, gaining international reputation. Many countries have placed orders with our country. Since 1955, the International Bookstore has trial-sold more than one million copies to foreign countries. Whether it is fraternal countries or capitalist countries, there are sales wherever the International Bookstore has connections, and the sales volume is gradually increasing. It has become one of the works of art that promotes international cultural exchange.
    At present, encouraged by the cultural departments in various places, the enthusiasm and confidence of paper cutting artists are very high. Paper cutting cooperatives or groups have been established in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Hebei, and the Northwest, where paper cutting is relatively concentrated. They have collected excellent samples from the local area and produced paper cuttings representing the special styles of various places. Paper cutting research groups have been established in Shanghai, Beijing, Yangzhou, Sichuan and other places, so that veteran artists can concentrate on research, thus enriching and broadening the variety, content and application of paper cutting.
    This folk art of paper cutting is also developing prosperously with the development of the national economy, the improvement of people's material and cultural life, and the international economic and cultural exchanges.

    剪纸
    剪纸，是一种民间艺术。
    它分为剪裁和刀刻二种。劳动人民，尤其是妇女们普遍爱好它。她们以自己的艺术天才，创造出寓意深刻的剪纸，如窗花、壁画、服饰、鞋帽、枕头、及衣服的刺绣花样，在馈赠亲友的礼物上有时也用它装点。剪纸艺术的线条虽很朴实，也包涵了作者的感情。在旧社会里，因剪纸为士大夫们所看不起，对这种艺术产生的时代，没有文字记载，也没有口头流传。但是，由于广大劳动人民对它的喜爱，故能世代沿袭的流传到现在。
    解放后，由于党和政府重视保存和发扬民间的艺术遗产，提倡剪纸艺术。通过1953年的第一届全国民间美术工艺展览，剪纸艺术更受到观众的重视，学习剪纸和购买剪纸的人日益增多。以后，它还参加由美术服务部所征集的美术工艺品出国展览会，和对外文化联络局主办的剪纸专题出国展览，先后在二十多个国家展出，在国际上获得声誉。好多国家向我国订货。从1955年以来，通过国际书店向外国试销即达一百几十万张，无论兄弟国家或资本主义国家，凡与国际书店有联系的地方都有销售，而且销售量也逐步增加。它已成为沟通国际文化交流的艺术品之一。
    目前在各地文化部门的鼓舞下，剪纸艺人们的热情和信心很高，北京、天津、上海、南京、福建、广东、浙江、江苏、四川、河北、西北凡剪纸比较集中的地区，都先后成立了剪纸合作社或小组，搜集了当地的优秀样品，生产出代表各地特殊风格的剪纸。上海、北京、扬州、四川等地，更建立了剪纸研究小组，老艺人们都能专心研究，因此剪纸的品种、内容和应用方面更为丰富广阔。
    剪纸这一民间艺术，随着国家经济的发展和人民物质生活文化生活的提高，以及国际间经济文化的交流，它也在欣欣向荣地发展。
