    Several Egyptian Documentary Films

    "Early Islamic Egypt" and "Badr al-Jamali" introduce the architectural art of Islamic Egypt. Those magnificent mosques and simple, beautiful sculptures fully demonstrate that Egypt is an ancient civilized country. "British Evacuation Day" records the true situation of the foreign colonialists' withdrawal from Egypt on June 18, 1956, and the extremely excited and joyful scenes of the Egyptian people. "Industrial Revival," "Egyptian Oil," "Happy Days," and "Cairo, Mother of the World," etc., let us understand how Egypt, after overthrowing the Farouk dynasty, achieved accomplishments and progress in industry, agriculture, handicrafts, and other aspects; and they also make us know and familiarize ourselves with many customs and habits of the Egyptian people. The large-scale color documentary "Ode to the Nile" has beautiful colors, clear pictures, and extremely poetic commentary. It systematically introduces the situation in Egypt after the victory of the revolution, the arduous struggle of the Egyptian people to regain sovereignty over the Suez Canal, the enthusiastic support of people from all over the world, and the birth and growth of friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people under the common goal of peace.

    The above-mentioned documentaries, except for "Ode to the Nile," which was produced by China Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, are all produced by Egypt. These films are currently being shown in Beijing and will soon be shown in Tianjin and Shanghai. (Fang)

    几部埃及的纪录片
    “埃及早期的伊斯兰教”和“巴德尔·加马里”两片，介绍了埃及伊斯兰教的建筑艺术。那巍峨宏伟的清真寺，那朴素美丽的雕塑，充分表明埃及是一个历史悠久的文明古国。“英军撤退节”纪载了1956年6月18日，外国殖民者撤出埃及的真实情况，以及埃及人民振奋无比的欢愉情景。“工业的复兴”、“埃及石油”、“幸福的日子”、“开罗，世界的母亲”等片，则使我们了解到，推翻了法鲁克王朝以后的埃及，如何在工业、农业、手工业等方面获得了成就和进展；而且也使我们知道和熟悉埃及人民的许多风俗习尚。大型彩色纪录片“尼罗河颂”，色彩美丽，画面清晰，解说词也极富诗意。它比较系统地介绍了埃及在革命胜利后的情况，埃及人民为收回苏伊士运河的主权所作的艰苦斗争，世界各国人民对他们的热情支持，以及在为了和平的共同目标下，中埃两国人民的友谊的滋生和生长。
    上述纪录片，除“尼罗河颂”是我国中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制的外，都是埃及出品。这些片子正在北京上映，并即将先后在天津、上海映出。（方）
