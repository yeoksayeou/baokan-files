Fujian Eliminates Plague and Smallpox

Many acute infectious diseases in Fujian Province have been brought under control or have had their incidence rates reduced.

Plague, which had been prevalent in Fujian for more than fifty years, stopped occurring as early as 1953; no cases of smallpox have been discovered since 1954; and cholera has been strictly controlled. The incidence of Japanese encephalitis, measles, diphtheria, gastrointestinal infectious diseases, etc., has also been greatly reduced. Schistosomiasis has a history of more than sixty years in this province, and many villages were destroyed by it before liberation. After liberation, the people's government extensively carried out preventive measures and actively treated the disease, and it is expected to be eliminated within seven years.

    福建消灭了鼠疫和天花
    许多烈性传染病在福建省已经被控制住或降低了发病率。
    在福建流行了五十多年的鼠疫早在1953年就停止发生了；天花从1954年起，就没有再发现一起病例；霍乱已经被严格控制住。乙型脑炎、麻疹、白喉、胃肠传染病等的发病率也大大降低。血吸虫病在这个省有六十年以上历史，解放前，不少村庄因此被毁灭。解放后人民政府广泛开展预防措施，积极治疗，预计在七年内可以消灭。
