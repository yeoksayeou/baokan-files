　　The situation in the Middle East is currently very tense, with the US and Turkey poised to invade Syria. All peace-loving people need to make the greatest effort to smash the American plot to invade Syria, stop the threat of war, and safeguard peace in the Middle East and the world.

　　After the failure of the American plot to subvert Syria, it is now doing its best to drive Turkey to invade Syria. The Turkish ruling clique, following American instructions, and regardless of the angry condemnation of Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab countries, and despite repeated warnings from the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, is actively preparing to invade Syria. Infantry units, artillery units, and armored tank units transferred from all over Turkey have been concentrated on the Syrian border, reaching 50,000 troops so far. At the same time, the US Sixth Fleet is concentrating in the Eastern Mediterranean, waiting for an opportunity to move out. The United States and Turkey have formulated a plan to launch a lightning attack on Syria immediately after the Turkish elections on October 27, and occupy Syria in one fell swoop. In order to threaten those Arab countries that support Syria's resistance to aggression, the naval and air forces of the United States, Britain, Turkey and other countries will hold large-scale exercises in the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf in November, conducting a so-called "powerful show of strength."

　　Coordinating with this military preparation, the Turkish Ambassador to the United States, Esin, wrote a letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 15th, continuing to slander Syria and insisting that Turkey has so-called "legitimate reasons" to feel uneasy about the situation in Syria. This is obviously preparing a pretext for Turkey to invade Syria according to American instructions. This Turkish action was immediately supported by the United States. US Secretary of State Dulles publicly announced on the 16th that the United States would use military force to back Turkey.

　　It is obvious that after the bankruptcy of its "position of strength" policy, American imperialism is risking provoking war in the Middle East in a frantic struggle to maintain its collapsing position in the Middle East and the entire capitalist world. This attempt by the United States makes the situation in the Middle East explosive and poses a serious threat to world peace.

　　Faced with this situation, Syrian Acting Foreign Minister Kalas received the diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed in Syria on the 15th and 16th, pointing out to them that Turkey's concentration of troops on the Syrian border was intended to launch a pre-planned aggression against Syria, thus constituting a serious threat to Syrian security and peace in the Middle East. Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, in a letter and memorandum to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 16th, pointed out the serious situation caused by Turkey's concentration of troops on the Syrian border in preparation for aggression, and requested an emergency meeting of the General Committee to discuss including the Syrian delegation's "complaint against threats to Syrian security and international peace" on the UN General Assembly agenda. Bitar requested that the United Nations organize a commission of investigation to investigate the situation on the Turkish-Syrian border in order to stop aggression in a timely manner and safeguard peace in the Middle East.

　　Syria's legitimate demand has received strong support from the Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, in a letter to UN General Assembly President Munro on the same day, exposed and strongly condemned the American conspiracy to instigate Turkey to invade Syria. Gromyko demanded that the United Nations immediately intervene in this dangerous situation to prevent the outbreak and expansion of war. The Soviet government suggested that if Turkey attacked Syria, UN member states should immediately provide Syria with the necessary armed assistance to stop the aggression. The Soviet government stated that the Soviet Union was prepared to send its own armed forces to participate in the struggle to suppress aggression and punish the peacebreakers.

　　The Soviet government's firm attitude against aggression and in defense of peace is a stern warning to American imperialism, which is trying to play with fire in the Middle East. We, the 600 million Chinese people, fully support the just position of the Syrian government and people in defending national independence and resisting aggression, and we also fully support the Soviet Union's firm attitude against American aggression and in defense of peace in the Middle East and the world. Chairman Mao Zedong, in a telegram to Syrian President Shukri al-Kuwatli, has reiterated "the solemn position of the Chinese government and the Chinese people in resolutely supporting the Syrian people's just struggle to defend independence and defend peace." As Foreign Minister Gromyko pointed out in his letter to Munro, the Syrian people, who are fighting to defend their independence and peace in the Middle East, are by no means isolated. The people of Arab countries, the people of the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving people around the world stand firmly on the side of the Syrian people. The Chinese people will also join them in supporting the Syrian people's resistance to aggression with all their strength.

　　In order to cover up the bankruptcy of its "position of strength" policy, American imperialism has always ignored the warnings issued by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. But the Soviet Union's current warning should make the United States realize that in this age of intercontinental missiles, if it dares to provoke a war, it will not be able to remain in a safe position like it did in the two world wars without suffering heavy blows. Not only the United States, but all countries that may be dragged into war because of participating in the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact must seriously consider this issue. As for Turkey, which has been chosen by the United States as the vanguard of aggression against Syria, it should especially take seriously the warnings of the Soviet Union and Arab countries and immediately stop the foolish behavior of pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the United States.

　　The American aggressor group and its Turkish followers should realize that times have changed. The peace-loving people of the world now have a strong force to deal a powerful blow to the instigators of war. The situation in the Middle East has not yet developed to the point of no return. The United States and its followers should immediately stop their plot to invade Syria before it is too late. Otherwise, they will not even have the opportunity to regret it.

### 不准侵略叙利亚！

　　不准侵略叙利亚！
    中东地区的局势目前非常紧张，美国和土耳其对叙利亚的侵略已经箭在弦上。一切爱好和平的人民需要作最大的努力来粉碎美国对叙利亚的侵略阴谋，制止战争威胁，维护中东和世界和平。
    美国对叙利亚进行颠覆活动的阴谋失败以后，现在正在竭力驱使土耳其侵略叙利亚。土耳其的统治集团按照美国的指示，不顾叙利亚、埃及、沙特阿拉伯等阿拉伯国家的愤怒谴责，不顾苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的一再警告，积极地进行着侵略叙利亚的准备。从土耳其各地调来的步兵部队、炮兵部队和装甲坦克部队已向叙利亚边境集结，到目前为止已达五万人。同时，美国的第六舰队正集中在东地中海伺机出动。美国和土耳其已经制定计划，准备在10月27日土耳其选举结束以后立即发动对叙利亚的闪电式进攻，一举而侵占叙利亚。为了威胁那些支持叙利亚抵抗侵略的阿拉伯国家，美国、英国、土耳其等国家的海空军将在11月间在阿拉伯海和波斯湾一带举行大规模演习，进行所谓“强大的实力示威”。
    配合着这种军事方面的准备，土耳其驻美大使艾辛在15日写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，继续对叙利亚大肆诬蔑，并且硬说土耳其有所谓“正当理由”对叙利亚局势感到不安。这显然是在为土耳其按照美国指示侵略叙利亚准备借口。土耳其这个行动立刻得到美国的支持。美国国务卿杜勒斯在16日公然宣布美国要用军事力量为土耳其撑腰。
    很明显，美帝国主义在它的“实力地位”政策宣告破产以后，不惜冒在中东挑起战争的危险，企图作疯狂的挣扎，以保持自己在中东和整个资本主义世界中的趋于崩溃的地位。美国的这种企图，使得中东局势充满着爆炸性，对世界和平形成了严重的威胁。
    面对着这种形势，叙利亚代理外交部长卡拉斯在15、16两天接见了驻叙利亚的各国外交使节，向他们指出土耳其在叙利亚边境上集结军队是打算对叙利亚发动事先策划好的侵略，因而构成了对叙利亚安全和中东和平的严重威胁。叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在16日给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的一封信和备忘录中，指出了土耳其在叙利亚边境集结部队准备进行侵略所造成的严重局势，要求召开总务委员会紧急会议，讨论把叙利亚代表团提出的“对威胁叙利亚安全和国际和平的控诉案”一项列入联大议程。比塔尔要求联合国组织调查委员会调查土、叙边境的局势，以便及时制止侵略，维护中东和平。
    叙利亚的这一正当的要求得到了苏联的有力的支持。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在同一天给联合国大会主席孟罗的信中，揭露并且严厉地谴责了美国指使土耳其侵略叙利亚的阴谋。葛罗米柯要求联合国立即出面干预这种危险的局势，以防战争的爆发和扩大。苏联政府建议，如果土耳其进攻叙利亚，联合国会员国应该立刻给予叙利亚以必要的武装援助，以制止侵略。苏联政府声明，苏联准备派自己的武装部队参加镇压侵略和惩罚和平破坏者的斗争。
    苏联政府这种反对侵略、维护和平的坚决态度，是对企图在中东玩火的美帝国主义的一个严厉的警告。我们六亿中国人民完全支持叙利亚政府和人民维护民族独立、反抗侵略的正义立场，也完全支持苏联反对美国侵略、维护中东和世界和平的坚决态度。毛泽东主席在给叙利亚总统舒克利·库阿特利的电报中，已重申“中国政府和中国人民坚决支持叙利亚人民保卫独立、保卫和平的正义斗争的严正立场”。正如葛罗米柯外长在给孟罗的信中所指出的，为维护自己的独立和中东和平而斗争的叙利亚人民决不是孤立的。阿拉伯国家的人民，苏联人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民都坚决地站在叙利亚人民这一边。中国人民也将同他们一起，以一切力量支援叙利亚人民抵抗侵略。
    美帝国主义为了掩饰它的“实力地位”政策的破产，一贯无视苏联和其他爱好和平的国家所提出的警告。但是苏联现在的警告应当使美国认识到，在这洲际导弹的时代，如果它敢于挑起战争，它就不可能像两次世界大战中那样处于安全的地位而不受到沉重的打击。不仅美国，所有因为参加美国所领导的北大西洋集团和巴格达集团而可能被卷入战争的国家，都必须严重地考虑这个问题。至于被美国挑选作为侵略叙利亚的先锋的土耳其，尤其应该认真看待苏联和阿拉伯国家的警告，立即停止为美国火中取栗的愚蠢行为。
    美国侵略集团和它的土耳其追随者应该认识到，时代已经变了。全世界爱好和平的人民现在有强大的力量给予战争制造者以有力的打击。中东的局势目前还没有发展到不可挽回的地步。美国和它的追随者们应当在为时未晚之前，立即停止对叙利亚的侵略阴谋。否则，它们就将连后悔的机会也没有了。
