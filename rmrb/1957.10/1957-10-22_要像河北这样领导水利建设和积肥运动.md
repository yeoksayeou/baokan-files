Today, this newspaper publishes news about Hebei Province holding a representative meeting of activists in water conservancy and manure accumulation, preparing to launch water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaigns. It can be seen that the Party and government leading organs of Hebei Province are actively responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and are determined, energetic, and resourceful in carrying out water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaigns this winter and next spring, which is worthy of reference and implementation by other regions.

Hebei Province has a large population and has historically lacked food. In normal years, it is necessary to transfer in 2 billion catties of grain annually, and even more grain needs to be transferred in disaster years. The Party and government leading organs of Hebei Province have been actively organizing the broad masses of farmers to develop agricultural production for several years. In the past half year, under the guidance and assistance of the Party Central Committee, they have conducted investigations and research, and summarized the work experience of the past few years. After repeated research and calculations by multiple provincial party committee meetings and the recent prefectural party committee secretary meetings, they have determined that by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan in 1962, the total grain output of the province should increase by 50% compared to 1957, reaching 30 billion catties, and the total cotton output should increase by 38% compared to 1957, reaching 1 billion catties. According to this plan, the total grain output next year will reach 22 billion catties, an increase of 10% compared to this year, and cotton will reach 700 million catties. This plan shows that the Party and government leading organs of Hebei Province are striving for a great leap forward in agricultural production with great determination and魄力. If this plan is realized, Hebei Province can not only fundamentally change the historical shortage of food, further improve the people's lives, but also begin to have surplus grain for disaster preparedness, and at the same time, may have more industrial raw materials to support the country's industrial construction.

From this example, people can more clearly understand that the important methods for increasing agricultural production at present are to vigorously carry out water conservancy construction and accumulate large amounts of manure. In 1958, Hebei's water conservancy construction tasks were to expand the irrigated area by 8 million mu, striving to reach 10 million mu, and also to improve the irrigated area by 1 million mu, to construct mass flood prevention and drainage projects such as ditches and furrowed fields by 20 million mu, to carry out soil and water conservation by 6,000 square kilometers, and the task of manure accumulation was to ensure that the amount of fertilizer applied per mu exceeded 5,000 catties. Most of these tasks are required to be completed this winter and next spring. In order to realize this plan, Hebei Province has strengthened leadership on the one hand and vigorously mobilized the masses on the other. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee has determined that the first secretary of the provincial party committee will personally take charge of agricultural production and grasp water conservancy construction and manure accumulation work; and requires that the first secretaries of party committees at all levels must personally grasp water conservancy and manure accumulation. Because these measures have been taken from top to bottom, and relying closely on the broad masses of activists to promote experience and lead the farmers of the province, a magnificent and powerful production upsurge centered on water conservancy construction and manure accumulation will soon appear.

It is entirely correct to emphasize water conservancy and manure accumulation in agricultural production. The general situation in our country is that there are more people and less land; there is not much potential in land reclamation, and the cost is very high. The fundamental direction of increasing agricultural production is to increase yield per unit area. Therefore, water conservancy and manure accumulation must be elevated to the most important position. The existing irrigated area in our country is less than one-third of the total cultivated land, and there is still much room for development. And among the masses, there is the threat of floods and droughts every year, and people have a very urgent demand for the development of water conservancy and manure accumulation. In addition, this year, the great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism has been carried out, the ideological and political work of the Party has been universally strengthened, the righteousness in the vast rural areas has risen, the evil has declined, and the understanding of the broad masses of farmers on cooperation and the policy of unified purchase and sales has deepened, and their awareness has been greatly improved. They are more wholeheartedly trying to develop production and run agricultural cooperatives well. At this time, loudly proposing to organize an upsurge in water conservancy and manure accumulation is entirely in line with the requirements and wishes of the broad masses of farmers. Therefore, this slogan is easily accepted by the broad masses of farmers and quickly turns into practical action.

One point that deserves special attention is that Hebei Province has made considerable preparations in terms of organizational leadership and mass ideology for the production upsurge this winter and next spring. In June of this year, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee held a special meeting to discuss agricultural production planning. In August, the provincial people's congress and the provincial water conservancy conference were held, and agricultural production and water conservancy construction were also studied. In September, the provincial party committee and the provincial people's committee organized leading cadres and business cadres from various counties to visit typical examples of well irrigation, mechanical irrigation, soil and water conservation, and low-lying area transformation in places such as Xingtang, Zhangjiakou, and Tianjin, and exchange experiences. After the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Launching Large-Scale Farmland Water Conservancy and Manure Accumulation Campaigns This Winter and Next Spring" was promulgated, Hebei Province used great efforts to prepare for the representative meeting of activists in water conservancy and manure accumulation. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee timely convened a meeting of prefectural party committee secretaries to discuss the great leap forward in agricultural production and deployed water conservancy and manure accumulation work this winter and next spring. After this series of preparations, the main cadres at all levels in the province have a clear goal—to promote a great leap forward in agricultural production and launch large-scale water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaigns this winter and next spring. As for the masses, they originally had great enthusiasm, and now the correct measures of the leadership and the enthusiasm of the masses are further combined, which will inevitably produce infinite power.

It is entirely believable that as long as we fully mobilize the masses and organize the power of the masses, we can create unprecedented miracles in history. In the first upsurge of water conservancy construction and manure accumulation in Hebei Province from January to June last year, water conservancy was constructed to expand the irrigated area by more than 10 million mu, which is almost equal to the sum of water conservancy construction in the province's past dynasties; soil and water conservation work was completed by 5,000 square kilometers; 850 billion catties of manure was accumulated, more than doubling the previous year. Nearly 800 representatives participated in this representative meeting of activists in water conservancy and manure accumulation. These representatives come from mountainous areas, low-lying areas, newly reclaimed coastal areas, and plains areas. Representatives from various types of regions have created rich experience in the great leap forward in production. These experiences were summarized and exchanged in detail at this meeting, which will effectively overcome right-leaning conservative ideas and greatly enhance the confidence and determination of the broad masses to complete the Second Five-Year Plan for agricultural production.

In the spring of 1956, the vast rural areas of our country all experienced hotbeds of water conservancy construction and manure accumulation of varying degrees, and achieved great results. All localities have accumulated many useful experiences. Using these experiences in the form of activist meetings to exchange, study and improve will enable us to lead this year's water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaign better and achieve greater results.

Finally, it is especially worth mentioning that Hebei Province has organized and led the production upsurge in the winter and spring seasons this time, starting early and acting quickly. It is estimated that by the end of October, the upsurge of water conservancy construction and manure accumulation will arrive throughout the province, three months earlier than in 1956. These three months are of great significance for completing the agricultural production tasks in 1958.

After several years of production and construction, all provinces in the country, like Hebei Province, have achievements, experiences, and tens of thousands of activists in water conservancy construction and manure accumulation. We hope that other provinces will refer to the practices of Hebei Province, and also hold similar meetings, use the experience of this province, and quickly set off a winter production upsurge.

### 要像河北这样领导水利建设和积肥运动

    要像河北这样领导水利建设和积肥运动
    今天本报发表了河北省召开水利、积肥积极分子代表会议，准备展开水利建设和积肥运动的消息。人们可以看出，河北省党政领导机关，积极响应党中央的号召，在开展今冬明春兴修水利和积肥运动方面，决心大，劲头足，办法好，值得各地参照实行。
    河北省人口较多，历来缺粮。平常年景每年要调进二十亿斤粮食，灾年要调进的粮食更多。河北省的党政领导机关，几年来一直在积极组织广大农民，发展农业生产。近半年来，他们在党中央的指示和帮助下，进行调查研究，并且总结了几年来的工作经验，经过多次省委会议和最近的地委书记会议的反复研究和计算，确定到第二个五年计划末一年——1962年，全省粮食总产量要比1957年增加50％，达到三百亿斤，棉花总产量将比1957年增加38％，达到十亿斤。按照这个计划，明年粮食总产量将达到二百二十亿斤，比今年增加10％，棉花达到七亿斤。这个计划表明，河北省的党政领导机关正以巨大的决心和魄力，争取农业生产上的巨大跃进。如果实现这个计划，河北省不仅可以根本改变历来的缺粮情况，使人民的生活得到进一步的改善，而且可以开始有余粮备荒，同时可能有更多的工业原料来支援国家的工业建设。
    从这个事例中，人们可以更清楚地了解：目前农业增产的重要办法是大力兴修水利和大量积肥。1958年河北全省的水利建设任务，是扩大灌溉面积八百万亩，争取达到一千万亩，还要改善灌溉面积一百万亩，建设沟洫畦田等群众性防涝排水工程二千万亩，水土保持六千平方公里，积肥任务要做到每亩施肥量超过五千斤。这些任务的绝大部分要求在今冬明春完成。为了实现这个计划，河北省一方面加强领导，一方面大力发动群众。中共河北省委已确定省委第一书记亲自掌握农业生产，掌握水利建设和积肥工作；并且要求各级党委第一书记都亲自抓紧水利和积肥。由于从上到下采取了这些做法，又紧紧依靠广大积极分子推广经验，带动全省农民，一个规模壮阔、声势浩大的以水利建设和积肥为中心的生产高潮，很快就会出现。
    在农业生产方面特别着重水利和积肥，这是完全正确的。我国总的情况是人多地少；在开荒方面没有太多的潜力，而且成本很大。农业增产的根本方向，是提高单位面积产量。因此，水利和积肥就必须被提到最重要的地位上来。我国现有的灌溉面积还不及全部耕地的三分之一，发展的余地还很大。而在群众方面，年年都有水旱灾害的威胁，人们对于发展水利和积肥也有非常迫切的要求。加上今年开展社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论，党的思想政治工作普遍加强，广大农村中正气上升，邪气下降，农民群众对于合作化和统购统销政策的认识加深，觉悟大大提高，他们就更加一心一意地要发展生产，把农业社办好。在这个时候，响亮地提出组织水利和积肥的高潮，是完全符合广大农民群众的要求和愿望的。因此，这个口号就很容易为广大农民群众所接受，并且迅速变成实际的行动。
    特别值得大家注意的一点，是河北省对于今冬明春的生产高潮，在组织领导上和群众思想上都有相当充分的准备。今年6月，中共河北省委开过专门会议，讨论农业生产规划。8月召开省人民代表大会和省水利会议，又研究了农业生产和水利建设的问题。9月间，省委和省人民委员会又组织各县党政负责干部和业务干部分赴行唐、张家口、天津等地参观掘井灌溉、机械灌溉、水土保持、洼地改造等典型实例，交流经验。党中央和国务院“关于今冬明春大规模地开展兴修农田水利和积肥运动的决定”公布以后，河北省用很大力量进行了水利、积肥积极分子代表会议的准备工作。中共八届三中全会以后，河北省委又及时召开了地委书记会议，讨论农业生产大跃进的问题，布置了今冬明春的水利和积肥工作。经过这一系列的准备，全省各级主要干部都有了明确的目标——推动农业生产大跃进，在今冬明春展开大规模的水利建设和积肥运动。至于群众方面本来就有很大的积极性，现在领导的正确措施和群众的积极性更进一步结合起来了，这就必然会产生无穷的力量。
    完全可以相信，只要我们充分地发动群众，组织群众的力量，我们就能创造在历史上空前未有的奇迹。河北省在去年1月至6月第一次水利建设和积肥的高潮中，就已经兴修水利扩大灌溉面积一千万亩以上，几乎等于本省历代水利建设的总和；水土保持工作完成五千平方公里；积肥八千五百亿斤，比往年增加一倍以上。这次参加水利积肥积极分子代表会议的代表近八百人。这些代表来自山区，低洼地区，滨海新垦地区和平原地区。各种类型地区的代表都创造了生产大跃进的丰富经验。这些经验都在这次会议上作了详细的总结和交流，这些将有效地克服右倾保守思想，大大地增强广大群众完成农业生产第二个五年计划的信心和决心。
    我国广大农村在1956年春季，都曾经出现过程度不同的水利建设和积肥的热潮，取得很大的成绩。各地都积累了许多有用的经验。这些经验用积极分子会议的形式加以交流、研究和提高，就将使我们对今年的水利建设和积肥运动能够领导得更好，收到更大的成效。
    最后，特别值得提到的，是河北省这一次组织领导冬春两季的生产高潮，动手早，行动迅速。估计10月下旬，在全省范围内，水利建设和积肥的高潮就将到来，比1956年提早三个月。这三个月的时间，对于完成1958年的农业生产任务是有很大意义的。
    经过几年来的生产建设，全国各省也像河北省一样，有成绩，有经验，也有成千上万的水利建设和积肥的积极分子。我们希望其他各省，参照河北省的作法，也能召开类似的会议，运用本省经验，迅速地掀起冬季生产的高潮。
