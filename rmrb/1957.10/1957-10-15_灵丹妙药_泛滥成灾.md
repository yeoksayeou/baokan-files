"Miracle Drug" Epidemic

　　In postwar America, prescription drugs are selling well. Pharmaceutical merchants have devised various tricks to obtain staggering excess profits. Companies manufacturing such drugs have sprung up like mushrooms, numbering as many as 250. For a time, "miracle drugs" became very popular. According to statistics from American medical institutions, the number of prescriptions for such drugs reached 577 million in 1955, increased to 629 million in 1956, and is estimated to reach 700 million in 1957. Not long ago, the American magazine "The Nation" exposed the various methods used by profit-seeking American pharmaceutical merchants to promote such drugs in an article.

　　In 1956 alone, more than 400 types of prescription drugs appeared in the United States. However, many of them were the same drug, just given different names by different companies.

　　Pharmaceutical merchants target practicing doctors as their main promotional objects. In addition to sending special personnel to promote drugs, they also send a large number of drug catalogs and brochures to practicing doctors. An ordinary doctor practicing in New York receives an average of 5,000 such promotional materials, brochures, and letters each year.

　　In addition to attacking practicing doctors, pharmaceutical merchants spend huge amounts of advertising fees to publish advertisements promoting these drugs in the "Journal of the American Medical Association." The "Journal of the American Medical Association," which originally had restrictions on publishing advertisements, published as many as 5,200 pages of pharmaceutical advertisements in 1956 alone. The advertising fee for each page of the journal is about $1,000, and the advertising revenue in 1956 reached a huge $5.2 million. Therefore, the "Journal of the American Medical Association" has become the fifth-largest advertising publication in the United States, surpassing "Life" magazine and "The Saturday Evening Post"! According to statistics from "The Nation," the American pharmaceutical industry spends $300 million on advertising each year!

　　Due to the proliferation of "miracle drugs," American doctors have become very tired of the pharmaceutical merchants' propaganda. According to recent statistics, 41.4% of American doctors completely ignore the pharmaceutical merchants' promotional materials. To this end, several large pharmaceutical companies have invested $7,500 to commission a psychoanalysis institution to study the psychology of doctors.

　　“灵丹妙药”泛滥成灾
    在战后的美国，凭医生处方的药品畅销。制药商人巧立名目，获得了惊人的超额利润。制造此类药品的公司风起云涌，数达二百五十家。一时“灵丹妙药”十分流行。据美国医疗机构统计，1955年这类药品处方已达五亿七千七百万件，1956年增至六亿二千九百万件，估计1957年将达七亿件。不久以前，美国“民族”周刊在一篇文章里暴露了唯利是图的美国制药商人推销此类药品的形形色色的手法。
    1956年一年间，美国出现了四百多种凭医生处方购买的药品。但是其中有许多是同一种药品，只是不同的公司给它们取了不同的名称罢了。
    制药商人把开业的医生作为主要宣传对象。除了派遣专人推销药品以外，并向开业医生寄发大量的药品目录、说明书。一个在纽约开业的普通医生，每年平均收到五千份此类宣传品、说明书及信件。
    除了向开业医生进攻以外，制药商人不惜耗费巨额的广告费在“美国医学会杂志”上刊登推销这类药品的广告。本来对刊登广告有所限制的“美国医学会杂志”，1956年一年刊登医药广告竟达五千二百页之多。该杂志广告费每页约美金一千元，1956年广告收入即达五百二十万元之巨。因此“美国医学会杂志”一跃而为美国第五个刊登广告最多的报刊，超过了“生活”周刊与“星期六晚报”！据“民族”周刊统计，美国制药业每年耗费的广告费达三亿美元！
    由于“灵丹妙药”泛滥，美国的医生们对制药商人的宣传已经感到十分厌倦了。据最近的统计，41.4％的美国医生根本不理睬制药商人的宣传品。为此，几家大制药公司已经出资美金七千五百元，委托一家心理分析机构来研究医生们的心理。　　　　　　　（乐山）
