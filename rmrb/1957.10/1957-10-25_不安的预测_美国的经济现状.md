    An Uneasy Prediction—The Economic Situation in the United States
    By Shi Mengxikefu, Soviet Union
    Just a few months ago, American economic observers were full of optimism. Economic magazines were filled with articles depicting the years to come as a period of continuous prosperity. In late spring and early summer, when official materials had already confirmed the beginning of a contraction in industrial production, the press was still meaningfully predicting autumn: By autumn, the situation would turn around, and everything would be fine...
    After much waiting, autumn finally arrived. But yesterday's optimists are not in a cheerful mood. The September 13th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" wrote: "Economic activity is gradually declining. There is no doubt that the era of fairly good times that lasted for nearly three years is gone." A few days later, a commentator for "The Wall Street Journal" reached the same conclusion: "A general decline in economic activity is inevitable." The "Daily Mirror" lamented: "No one knows what will happen in the end. In any case, the good times are over."
    Now, American economists no longer intend to discuss whether there is a decline. They are only busy guessing to what extent the decline will reach and how long it will last. Some say that a sharp decline in production can be avoided, while others say that the decline will not be large, but it will be very long, at least a year and a half. In any case, most people believe that the American economy is now at a critical crossroads, and the prospects are not optimistic.
    The above worries are based on reliable grounds. Since the beginning of 1956, the downward trend in national consumer goods production has not weakened for many months. At present, the output of automobiles and radios has decreased by 30% compared with the highest level in 1955; the output of washing machines has also decreased by 30%; and the output of television sets has decreased by more than 20%. In the first half of 1957, textile production decreased by 3% compared with the first half of last year, and the number of residential buildings has also decreased a lot compared with last year.
    The capitalists in these sectors are hoping that the market situation will improve, and that as long as residential construction and the automobile industry become active, they can lead the entire economy out of the mire. But it is too naive and ridiculous to place hope on this kind of logic. For example, the September issue of "Fortune" magazine quoted the opinions of some builders, which are: the situation will certainly improve, because... it is impossible to be worse than it is now. However, they cannot provide any reliable evidence for this prediction.
    The automobile industry is also fantasizing about such a "miracle":
    The new products of 1958 suddenly fascinated users, and thus a new period of "prosperity" appeared. However, at the beginning of September, the inventory of unsold cars increased by 55% compared with the same period last year. These backlogs threaten to turn the fantasy of "miracle" into a bubble.
    Not long ago, the decline in the production of daily necessities did not cause violent anxiety. Because heavy industry continued to receive large orders for building factories and adding new equipment, and received a large number of record-breaking appropriations for capital investment, but now this source that can activate industry has also disappeared.
    Production capacity has always grown together with production in the past. In recent months, although the general level of industrial production has decreased by 2% from December last year to August this year, production capacity has continued to grow. Therefore, the underutilization of production equipment has greatly increased. According to the materials of "Business Week", the equipment utilization rate of the steel industry in June this year was 80% (usually 95% to 97%), the machinery manufacturing industry was 84%, the chemical industry was 83%, the oil refining industry was 88%, and the consumer goods industry sector only had 30% to 40%, and individual sectors also had 50%.
    In this case, continued investment is not worthwhile. Therefore, many companies, including the largest ones, have begun to consider reducing their original investment plans. The total investment in the first three quarters of 1957 has nominally grown (due to the rise in prices, there is actually no increase), but in the last quarter, according to the materials of the Ministry of Commerce, it is estimated that it will be reduced. This is the first investment reduction since 1955. "Newsweek" reported that in the second quarter, the new investment appropriations of some of the largest industries have decreased by 29% compared with a year ago.
    This reduction is not something short-term. "The Wall Street Journal" is very well-informed in this regard. According to its estimation, expenditures on building new factories and purchasing industrial equipment next year will be reduced again. This newspaper asked seventy-four companies about the investment figures for 1958. Only seventeen companies answered that they expected to increase investment, and most of them were either planning to reduce it or were preparing to at least not increase it.
    The interruption of the "investment boom" is a serious blow to heavy industry and even the entire economy. At present, the decline in the production of consumer goods has further aggravated the reduction in the demand for means of production. Of course, many companies are still hoping that the market situation will improve, and continue to produce more goods than possible sales. Other companies are relying on previous orders to barely maintain the original production level, turning a blind eye to the trend of new orders being reduced. But these situations put heavy industry in danger of a large backlog. The newsletter of the Citibank of New York said: "This trend will obviously not last too long. If new orders cannot adapt to the current production level, and the shipped goods and the previous uncompleted orders will eventually dry up, then production will have to be reduced to another level to adapt to the new scale of economic activity."
    In the heavy industry sector, the steel industry, the oil extraction industry, and the non-ferrous metal extraction industry are particularly feeling the difficulty of sales. Steel production, which was able to maintain last year's level in the first half of the year, began to shrink in September. Oil extraction volume decreased a lot from June to September. In Texas, the largest oil-producing area in the United States, many oil companies only worked for ten days in September, while the usual number of working days is more than fifteen days. The extraction of copper, zinc, and tin began to shrink in the spring and is still continuing to decline. Due to the sharp drop in prices, mines are closing down one after another.
    The aluminum industry has not experienced overproduction for a long time because of the government's large number of orders for military aircraft. Now even this industry has felt the impact of the new situation. The largest aluminum industry trust—Aluminum Company of America—which has always been given various preferential treatments and guarantees by the government, also intends to stop production at one of its factories from November 1st and greatly reduce production at another factory.
    Many other weaknesses in the economy are making the industrial situation more complicated. The expected agricultural harvest this year has been revealed: the total output of agricultural products will decrease by 3% compared with last year, and the output of livestock products will decrease by 1%. This situation is mainly caused by the government's measures to reduce millions of hectares of cultivated land. For example, the area planted with cotton has decreased by 15%, the area planted with wheat has decreased by 13%, and the area planted with corn has decreased by 5%. All of these make it impossible for farmers' incomes to increase, thereby restricting the supply of industrial products to rural areas.
    The increasing turbulence in the American economy is also reflected in credit and finance. Although the amount of investment is decreasing, the items sold in installments have not increased for more than a year and a half, the number of applications for loans from banks has not decreased, but has increased. The interest on bank loans has reached the highest peak since the crisis era of 1933, but it is becoming more and more difficult to obtain loans. The July issue of "U.S. News & World Report" mentioned that some small and medium-sized industrialists had to borrow from so-called "private companies", that is, usurers, paying annual interest rates of 12%, 15%, or even 18%, after the banks refused to grant loans.
    Most companies are now short of cash, which shows that the problem of overproduction of commodities has become increasingly acute. The crisis in the financial credit sector is still relatively hidden for the time being. But it can erupt into an open wave of bankruptcies at any time under the influence of any major shock.
    The following example is very illustrative. This spring, the official announcement stated that the annual rate of total profits of American companies in the first quarter could reach 46.5 billion US dollars. By July, this estimate was revised and reduced to 43.9 billion US dollars. The motives for the revision may only be speculated, but the difference in numbers is so large (2.6 billion US dollars!) that it inevitably raises the question: Is the financial situation of the companies, including large companies, really so stable that it can be seen at a glance?
    The sensitive barometer—the stock exchange—has reflected these temporarily hidden panic phenomena several times in recent months. There was a big drop in stock prices in mid-August, and another one in early September.
    On September 23, stocks fell sharply again, falling to the lowest price in the past two years. According to the Associated Press, the panic in the stock exchange caused "greater pessimism and disappointment on Wall Street."
    Not surprisingly, in this panicked and uneasy economic situation, the attention of the monopoly capitalist newspapers is focused on the government's expansion of armaments and military expenditures. In the summer, the government could not withstand the pressure from those enterprises that were not directly related to military orders, and announced that it was preparing to "save" military expenses. In fact, the result of this promise was only to reduce the military expenditures that had been overspent in the first half of the year to within the budgeted amount.
    From June, the military department really began to cancel some of the contracts that had been ordered in the past. This incident caused panic in the economic circles. The bourgeois newspapers stirred up trouble and expanded this panic. Newspapers and magazines published many messages about arms factories preparing to close down and lay off workers. Of course, the arms concerns were the first to feel panic. But this time, the monopoly enterprises in the civilian production sector were also with them. These enterprises feared that the reduction of military orders might be like adding fuel to the fire, eventually leading to the outbreak of a total crisis.
    In fact, the panic was a little premature. It turned out that the Department of Defense was not reducing military contracts, but simply reallocating them in order to accelerate the expansion of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons. Secretary of Defense Wilson hurriedly declared to newspaper reporters that the "savings" measures would not have a large reduction in military expenditures, and these military expenditures would still exceed the budget figures as before.
    But for the arms concerns, these statements were still not enough. They insisted that the government's order expenses should be greatly increased. The London "Financial Times" wrote: "American news, Congress is reconsidering its view on military spending. The increase in defense expenditure is considered absolutely necessary. The increase in military spending will directly affect the economic situation in the United States, offsetting the downward trend."
    The American arms concerns only know how to seize high profits and rarely care about the country's overall economic situation. However, doing everything possible to increase taxes or issue more public bonds to cope with the growing military expenditures that would otherwise be impossible to cope with contains great dangers in the current situation. The warnings of former President Hoover and the recently resigned Treasury Secretary Humphrey a few months ago that if government expenditures continue to increase, it will soon push the United States into the abyss of a financial and economic crisis are still playing a role. This warning seems even more realistic now. When the weak purchasing power is not only reflected in the production of consumer goods, but also further reflected in heavy industry, it would be fatal to the American economy to intensify the arms race again.

    不安的预测——美国的经济现状
    苏联　史·孟希科夫
    不过几个月以前，美国经济观察家们还充满乐观情绪。经济杂志上到处登载着文章，把未来的岁月描绘为不断发展的繁荣。春末夏初，当官方材料已肯定了工业生产开始缩减的时候，新闻界还在含意深长地预示着秋季：到秋天情况就会转变，一切就都好了……
    左等右等，秋天终于盼到了。可是这些昨天的乐观家精神上并没有愉快。9月13日的“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊写到：“经济活动已渐趋下降。毫无疑问，将近三年来相当不错的景气时代是一去不返了。”过了几天，“华尔街杂志”的评论家得出了同样的结论：“经济活动的普遍低落是必不可免的。”“每日镜报”哀声叹气地写道：“到底会弄成什么样子，谁也不知道，无论如何，好日子是完了。”
    现在，美国的经济学家已不打算再讨论有没有下降的问题。他们只是忙着猜测会下降到什么程度和下降会延续多久。有些人说可以避免生产的急剧下降，另外一些人说下降幅度不会大，可是却很长久，至少要一年半。无论怎样说法，大多数人都认为美国经济现在正处在紧急的十字路口，前景不容乐观。
    上面这种忧虑，是有可靠的根据的。从1956年年初起，全国消费品生产的下降趋势，好多个月来都没有减弱。目前汽车和收音机的产量比1955年的最高水平减少了30％；洗衣机的产量也降低了30％；电视机减少了20％以上。1957年上半年纺织品产量比去年上半年下降了3％，住宅建筑数量比去年也减少了很多。
    这些部门的资本家指望着市场情况会好转，指望着只要住宅建筑和汽车工业一活跃，便可以带动整个经济脱离泥潭。但是把希望寄托在这种逻辑上是太幼稚可笑了。例如，“幸福”杂志9月号引述某些建筑商的意见，这些意见是：情况当然得好转，因为……比现在再坏是不可能的。不过他们对这种预测却拿不出什么可靠的证据出来。
    汽车工业也同样在幻想着这样的“奇迹”：
    1958年的新产品突然迷住了用户的心，于是“繁荣”的新时期出现了。但是，9月初卖不出去的汽车存货比去年同期增加了55％。这些积压的存货威胁着要把“奇迹”的幻想变成泡影。
    不久以前，日用品生产的下降，还没有引起剧烈的不安。因为重工业继续接到为建筑工厂和添置新装备的大批订货，接到用于资本投资的大量破纪录的拨款，但现在这个能使工业活跃的源泉也消失了。
    生产能力以前总是跟生产一起增长。最近数月来，虽则工业生产的一般水平从去年12月到今年8月已下降了2％，可是生产能力却还在继续增长。因此，生产设备开工不足的情况已大大增加。根据“商业周刊”的材料，钢铁业的设备利用率在本年6月是80％（平常是95％到97％），机器制造业是84％，化学工业是83％，石油提炼业是88％，消费品工业部门只有30％到40％，个别部门也有50％的。
    在这种情况下，继续投资已不合算。因此许多公司，包括最大的公司在内，开始考虑削减原来的投资计划。1957年前三个季度的投资总额在名义上还有所增长（由于物价的上涨，实际上并无增加），但到最后一个季度，根据商务部的材料，估计将会缩减。这是从1955年以来的第一次投资减缩。“新闻周刊”报道，在第二季度，一些最大的工业的新投资拨款已比一年前减少了29％。
    这种缩减并不是某种短期性的。“华尔街日报”在这方面消息很灵通，据它估计，明年在建筑新工厂和购置工业设备方面的开支，将再度降低。这家报纸向七十四家公司询问1958年的投资数字。只有十七家回答可望增加投资，大多数不是打算削减，就是准备至少不增加。
    “投资景气”的中断是对重工业以至整个经济的一个严重打击。目前消费品产量的下降，更加重了对生产资料的需求的减少。固然，许多公司还抱着市场情况好转的希望，继续生产着比可能的销售量多得多的商品。另外一些公司在依靠以前所接的定货，勉强维持着原来的生产水平，对新定货将要缩减的趋势熟视无睹。但是这些情况却使重工业面临大量积压的危险。纽约花旗银行的通报说：“这种趋势显然不会太长久。如果新的定货不能适应目前的生产水平，而运出的货物和以前没有完工的定货最后终将涸竭，那么生产就得缩减到另一种水平来适应经济活动的新规模”。
    在重工业部门中，钢铁业、石油开采业、有色金属开采业尤其感到销售的困难。上半年还能维持去年水平的钢铁生产，到9月便已开始缩减。石油开采量从6月到9月减少了很多。在美国最大的石油产地德克萨斯州许多石油公司9月份只开工十天，而通常开工日数则在十五天以上。铜、锌、锡的开采，从春季便开始缩减，现在一直还在继续下降。因价格暴跌，一家家矿井相继倒闭。
    制铝工业靠着政府在军用飞机方面的大量定货，已很久没有经历生产过剩，现在连这个行业也感受到新局势的冲击了。最大的铝业托辣斯——美国铝业公司——一向受到政府各式各样的优惠和保证，也打算从11月1日起使它的一个工厂停止生产，并且大大削减另一个工厂的生产。
    经济上存在的其他许多弱点，使得工业的情况更加复杂化起来。今年预计的农业收成已见分晓：农产品的总产量要比去年减少3％，畜产品减少1％。这种情况主要是由于政府采取了减少几百万公顷耕地面积的措施所造成的。例如，植棉面积减少了15％，小麦种植面积减少了13％，玉蜀黍的种植面积减少了5％。所有这些都使农场主的收入不可能增加，从而使工业品对农村的供应量受到了限制。
    美国经济不断增加的动荡也在信贷和金融方面反映出来。尽管投资额在减少，分期付款出售的物品已有一年半多没有增加，向银行申请贷款的却不但没有减少，反而还在增多。银行贷款的利息达到了从1933年危机时代以来的最高峰，但想要获得贷款却越来越困难。“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志7月里的一期上曾讲到，一些中、小工业企业主，在银行拒绝给予贷款后，不得不向所谓“私家公司”即高利贷者告贷，付出的年息达一分二厘、一分五厘，甚至一分八厘。
    大多数公司现在都缺乏现金，这说明商品生产过剩的问题已显得越来越尖锐了。金融信贷范围内的危机暂时还比较隐蔽。但它在受到任何大震动的影响下随时可以爆发为公开的纷纷倒闭的风潮。
    下面的一个例子很能说明问题。今年春季官方宣布，第一季度美国各公司的总利润的年率可以达到四百六十五亿美元，到7月，这个估计被修改而缩减为四百三十九亿美元。修改的动机也许只能揣测，但是数目相差这样大（二十六亿美元！），以致必然引起这样的疑问：难道各公司的金融情况，包括大公司在内，果真这样稳固以致一眼就能看得出来吗？
    感觉灵敏的气压表——证券交易所——在最近几个月里几次反映了这些暂时还是隐蔽着的惊惶现象。8月中发生了一次股票大跌价，9月初又发生了一次。
    9月23日股票再次大跌，跌到最近两年来的最低价格。据美联社报道，证券交易所的惶乱引起了“华尔街更大的悲观失望”。
    毫不奇怪，在这种惊惶不安的经济情况下，垄断资本家报纸的注意力要集中于政府的扩充军备和军费开支了。夏天，政府经不住与军事定货没有直接关系的那部分企业的压力，宣布准备“节约”军事费用。实际上，这个诺言的结果只是把上半年超支太多的军事开支缩到预算的规定数目以内。
    从6月起，军事部门真的开始取消某些过去所订的合同。这件事引起了经济界的恐慌。资产阶级报纸更兴风作浪，扩大这种恐慌。报纸杂志上登载着许多军火工厂准备关门解雇工人的消息。当然，军火康采恩最先感到恐慌。但是，这次同它们一道的还有民用生产部门的垄断企业。这些企业害怕军事定货的减少可能像是火上加油，最后导致总危机的爆发。
    事实上惊慌未免过早了些。原来国防部并不是在减少军事合同，只是重新分配了一下，以便加速核武器和火箭武器的扩张。国防部长威尔逊赶忙对报纸记者声明，“节约”措施对军事开支不会有较大的缩减，这些军事开支仍和以前一样将超出预算数字。
    但是，对于军火康采恩说来，仅是这些声明还是太不够，它们坚持政府定货费用还要大大增加。伦敦“金融时报”写道：“美国消息，国会正在重新考虑对军事开支的看法。国防费用的增加被认作是绝对必需的。军事开支的增加会直接影响美国的经济情况，抵消下降的趋势。”
    美国的军火康采恩只知攫取高额利润，很少关心国家的整个经济情况。但是千方百计地增加赋税或增发公债来应付否则就会无法应付的增长着的军事开支，在目前情势下却包含着很大的危险性。几个月前，前总统胡佛和不久以前辞职的财政部长汉弗莱的警告：如果政府开支继续增加，那就会很快把美国推向财政经济危机的深渊，仍然在起着作用。这个警告到现在更显得现实了。等到人们微弱的购买力不但反映在消费品生产上面，而且进一步反映到重工业上面的时候，再想加紧扩军，对美国经济就会是致命的了。
