    Hunan Folk Art Exhibition in Beijing
    Exquisite Craftsmanship of Various Ethnic Groups, Four Hundred Exhibits Rich and Diverse
    The "Hunan Province Folk Arts and Crafts Exhibition," organized by the Chinese Artists Association, is now open at the Art Exhibition Hall in Shuaifuyuan, Beijing. The four hundred plus exhibits were collected and selected from the works of women of the Tujia, Miao, Dong, Yao, and Han ethnic groups in Hunan, as well as professional artisans, each with its own distinct artistic style.
    Cotton woven bedspreads are the Tujia people's favorite art form. The patterns mostly use the images of lion heads, tiger skins, horse flowers, and animals and plants such as plums, chrysanthemums, fish, and insects, fully reflecting the Tujia people's feelings of celebration and peace after hunting, as well as their love for nature.
    The Miao's forty-odd flower belts have complex composition changes. A three-foot-long belt often has one or twenty different but very harmonious patterns. The Dong's cotton woven floral fabrics use a variety of geometric patterns to form a picture, with simple, pure, and elegant colors. The Yao's embroidered headscarves are very emotional in their color treatment; the vibrant colors make you excited and happy, while the soft colors make you feel stable and comfortable. The Han's blue printed cloth and embroidery retain many traditional composition methods and patterns. Blue flowers on a white background, white flowers on a blue background, the contrast is generous, practical, economical, and beautiful.
    Among the exhibits is a wood carving relic "King Zhuang Drumming" made by the old painter Qi Baishi before he was thirty years old when he was a carpenter. The image of King Zhuang is quite vivid and is a culturally significant relic.

    湖南民间工艺品在京展览
    各民族手艺巧夺天工四百件展品丰富多采
    中国美术家协会举办的“湖南省民间工艺美术展览会”，已在北京帅府园美术展览馆展出。四百余件展览品是从湖南土家族、苗族、侗族、瑶族和汉族妇女们以及专业艺人的作品中搜集选出的，艺术风格各具特色。
    棉织被面是土家族最喜欢的艺术品，图案多用狮子头、老虎皮、马花和梅、菊、鱼、虫等动植物的形象构成，充分反映了土家族人民兽猎完毕，庆泰平安，以及热爱大自然的心情。
    苗族的四十多条花带构图变化复杂。一条三尺长的带子，常有一二十个不同的但又是很调和的花纹。侗族的棉织花布，采用多种的几何图案构成一个画面，颜色简单纯朴而雅致。瑶族的挑花头巾，在色彩的处理上很有感情，热烈的彩色使你兴奋愉快，淡雅的使你安稳舒服。汉族的蓝印花布和挑花，保留有很多传统的构图法和纹样。蓝底白花，白底蓝花，对比大方，适用、经济、美观。
    展览品中，有一件老画家齐白石三十岁以前做木匠时候的木雕遗作“庄王擂鼓”，庄王形象颇为生动，是一件有纪念意义的文物。
