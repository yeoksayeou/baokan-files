Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Association for Science and Technology, and the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization jointly held a meeting in Beijing this afternoon to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

More than 1,000 science and technology workers and scientific administrators from the capital attended the meeting. More than a dozen Soviet experts and Soviet graduate students working in various research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing were also invited to attend the meeting.

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered the opening speech. He first expressed his lofty respect and heartfelt congratulations to the great Soviet people and the great Soviet scientific and technological circles on behalf of the three scientific units and the national science and technology workers. Guo Moruo said that the Soviet Union's brilliant achievements in science and technology and in all aspects of construction were so rapid, on such a grand scale, and of such surpassing quality. All this shows the greatness of Lenin, who linked Marxism with China's revolutionary practice and flexibly applied and developed it, shows that Marxism-Leninism is an invincible truth, shows the superiority of the socialist system, and shows the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Guo Moruo said that with the shining example of the Soviet Union, we can not only have unlimited confidence in construction, but also achieve twice the result with half the effort. In developing scientific undertakings, with the shining example and great selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, we are guaranteed to catch up with the advanced world level.

Guo Moruo said: We Chinese scientists are very fortunate to be born today. We have the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the deep concern of the government and the people, the urgent need for national construction, and the selfless help of the Soviet people and Soviet scientists. We have full guarantees to complete the tasks given to us by the country.

With these good objective conditions, what is particularly worth mentioning to promote everyone's attention is the subjective efforts of our Chinese scientists to adapt to the times.

Guo Moruo called on Chinese scientists to unite as one, to unite closely around the Communist Party, to resolutely accept the leadership of the Communist Party, to hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism even higher, and to wholeheartedly take the socialist road; to deeply understand the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily, governing science diligently and thriftily, to cultivate an honest and simple style, to master the proletarian world outlook, to closely integrate their research work with national construction, and to continuously improve their theoretical level to match the constantly developing reality; to learn from Soviet scientists, to learn the spirit of patriotism and internationalism of Soviet scientists, and to cooperate closely with Soviet scientists in an all-round way to serve the construction of the motherland, to serve the development of science, and to serve the defense of world peace.

After Guo Moruo's speech, Fan Wenlan, Director of the Third Institute of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a report on "The Influence of the October Revolution on the Chinese Revolution"; Professor Samoilov, leader of the Soviet Expert Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a report on "The Main Development Directions and Achievements of Soviet Natural Science in the Past Forty Years"; and Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a report on "The Great Help and Influence of the Soviet Union on China's Scientific Undertakings."

The conference will continue on the afternoon of the 31st.

    郭沫若号召科学家要全心全意地走社会主义的道路
    据新华社30日讯　中国科学院、中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会和中华全国科学技术普及协会今天下午在北京联合举行大会，庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年。
    参加大会的有首都科学技术工作者和科学行政人员一千多人。在中国科学院北京各研究单位帮助工作的苏联专家以及苏联研究生等十多人也应邀参加了大会。
    中国科学院院长郭沫若致开幕词。他首先代表三个科学单位和全国科学技术工作者对伟大的苏联人民、伟大的苏联科学技术界表示崇高的敬意和衷心的祝贺。郭沫若说，苏联在科学技术上的辉煌成就以及在建设事业各方面的辉煌成就，速度这样迅速，规模这样宏大，质量这样超越，这一切说明了把马克思主义联系着我国革命实际而灵活运用并加以发展的列宁的伟大，说明了马克思列宁主义是战无不胜的真理，说明了社会主义制度的优越性，说明了苏联共产党领导的正确性。郭沫若说，有了苏联的光辉榜样，我们在建设上不仅可以得到无限信心，并且可以得到事半功倍的成效，在发展科学事业上，有了苏联的光辉榜样和伟大无私的援助，我们是有保证能够迎头赶上世界先进水平的。
    郭沫若说：我们中国科学家生在今天是十分幸运的。我们有共产党的正确领导，有政府和人民的深切关怀，有国家建设的迫切需要，还有苏联人民和苏联科学家的无私帮助，我们是有充分的保障可以完成国家给予我们的任务的。
    有了这些好的客观条件，特别值得提出促进我们大家注意的，那就是需要我国科学家们和时代相适应的主观努力了。
    郭沫若号召中国科学家要团结一致，紧紧地团结在共产党的周围，坚决地接受共产党的领导，更高地举起马克思列宁主义的旗帜，全心全意地走社会主义的道路；深深地体会勤俭建国、勤俭治科学的精神，养成诚实朴素的作风，掌握无产阶级的世界观，使自己的研究工作和国家建设密切结合，不断地提高理论水平以配合不断发展的实际；向苏联科学家看齐，学习苏联科学家的爱国主义与国际主义的精神，紧密地和苏联科学家进行全面的合作，来为祖国建设服务，为发展科学事业服务，为保卫世界和平服务。
    郭沫若致词后，中国科学院历史研究所第三所所长范文澜作了“十月革命对中国革命的影响”的报告；中国科学院苏联专家组组长萨莫伊洛夫教授作了“苏联自然科学四十年来的主要发展方向和成就”的报告；中国科学院副院长吴有训作了“苏联对我国科学事业的巨大帮助和影响”的报告。
    31日下午大会将继续举行。
