　　Great Debate Brings New Atmosphere
　　Many Farmers Who Withdrew from Cooperatives Bring Their Horses Back
    In Jilin Province, more than 900 backward cooperatives (accounting for about 14% of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in the province) have been universally rectified and improved through the great debate on the two roads in the countryside.
    Many farmers who had already withdrawn from the cooperatives with their horses have now rejoined. According to statistics from six counties, including Lishu, Jiutai, Yongji, and Dongfeng, in early September, more than 660 households who had withdrawn with their horses have returned them to the cooperatives. According to statistics from twenty-one cities and counties, including Dongfeng, Panshi, Huaide, and Jiutai, more than 5,000 households of cooperative members who originally planned to withdraw after the autumn harvest have now resolved not to withdraw. In addition, more than 5,000 individual farmers have joined the cooperatives.

    Autumn Harvest Completed Half a Month Early
    The Fourth Production Team of the Limin Agricultural Cooperative in Sujiatuo Township, a suburb of Beijing, achieved a 100% attendance rate and doubled labor productivity through debate, completing the autumn harvest half a month earlier than in previous years.
    In the past, the Fourth Production Team was a notorious "weak team" among the seventeen production teams in the cooperative. The attendance rate was low, it was common to go to work late and leave early, and there was a widespread phenomenon of picking easy tasks and competing for work points. After the debate on the grain issue began on October 6th, and after criticizing the capitalist thinking of wealthy middle peasant Zhao Wenzhen, the socialist consciousness of all team members was universally improved. In the past, the team leader had to find cooperative members to arrange work; now, cooperative members find the team leader. As soon as the team leader arranges the work, the team members go to the fields early in the morning. Labor productivity has also increased by 50% to 100% compared to before. The team's 180 mu of corn was originally planned to take thirteen people six days to harvest, but it was completed in two and a half days, and the corn cobs were also picked cleaner and the corn stalks were bundled better than in the past.

    Actively Handing Over Public Grain and Selling Surplus Grain
    After socialist propaganda and education and debates on grain issues in the rural areas of Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, agricultural cooperatives in various places actively handed over public grain and sold surplus grain. As of the 15th, the total amount of grain stored in the entire prefecture had reached more than 585 million jin, exceeding the "three fix" task by 3.9% excluding sweet potatoes (which have not yet been harvested), and selling more than 82.8 million jin of surplus grain than last year.
    The grain purchase work in Liaocheng Prefecture was carried out in conjunction with socialist propaganda and education. After exposing and criticizing the concealment of production and private distribution within the cooperatives, many agricultural cooperatives reported their actual yields and sold more surplus grain.

　　大辩论带来新气象
　　许多退社农民拉马回社
    吉林省九百多个落后社（占全省农业社总数的14％左右），经过农村两条道路的大辩论，普遍得到整顿和提高。
    许多已经拉马退社的农民，现在又重新回了社。据梨树、九台、永吉、东丰等六个县9月上旬的统计，已有六百六十多户拉马退社的农民，又把马送回了社。东丰、磐石、怀德、九台等二十一个市县的统计，原来打算秋后退社的社员有五千多户，现在也下决心不退社了。另有五千多户单干农民入了社。
    提前半月完成秋收
    北京市郊苏家坨乡利民农业社第四生产队，通过辩论，出勤率达到百分之百，劳动生产率提高了一倍，全队比往年提前半个月完成了秋收任务。
    过去，第四生产队是这个社十七个生产队当中有名的“弱队”，出勤率低，下地干活晚去早回形成习惯，挑活争工分现象很普遍，活茬质量也不好。10月6日展开粮食问题辩论，批判了队员富裕中农赵文珍的资本主义思想以后，全体队员社会主义觉悟普遍得到提高。过去出勤安排活茬是队长找社员，现在是社员找队长，队长一安排了活茬，队员们一大清早就下地了。劳动生产率也比以前提高50％到100％。全队一百八十亩玉米，原计划要十三个人六天才能收完，结果两天半就收完了，而且玉米棒子比以往也掰得干净，玉米秸也捆得好。

    积极缴公粮卖余粮
    山东省聊城专区经过农村社会主义宣传教育和有关粮食问题的辩论后，各地农业社积极缴纳公粮和出售余粮。到15日止，全专区入库粮食总数已达五亿八千五百多万斤，除甘薯外（还未收）超过“三定”任务3.9％，比去年多卖余粮八千二百八十多万斤。
    聊城专区的粮食征购工作是结合社会主义宣传教育进行的。许多农业社在揭发和批判了社内瞒产、私分的情况后，纷纷报实产量，多卖余粮。  （据新华社讯）
