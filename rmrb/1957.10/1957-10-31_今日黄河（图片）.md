    Today's Yellow River
    After liberation, steamboats began to travel the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The picture on the right shows the "Yellow River No. 1" passenger and cargo ship sailing on the Yellow River waterway in Shandong Province.

    In the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the water is turbulent, but the riverbed is very shallow. People in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu Province have taken advantage of this characteristic to create horse-drawn boats. The picture below shows a horse-drawn boat with a load capacity of more than 1,000 catties.

    黄河上游，水势湍急，但河床甚浅。甘肃省甘南藏族自治州的人民利用了这个特点，创造了马拉船。下图便是载重量达一千多斤马拉船。
