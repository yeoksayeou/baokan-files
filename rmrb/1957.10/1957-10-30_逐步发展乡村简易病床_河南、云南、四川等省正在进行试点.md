	Gradually Develop Rural Simple Hospital Beds
	Pilot Programs Underway in Henan, Yunnan, Sichuan and Other Provinces

	This newspaper reports that after the Eighth National Congress of the Party put forward the suggestion of "gradually developing simple hospital beds in rural areas," Henan, Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces have strengthened their investigation, research, and leadership in this area. After pilot programs, they are preparing for gradual development. According to a survey in Henan Province, the masses have responded very well to "rural simple hospital beds." They said: "It is close, convenient, and inexpensive." Among the residents of certain districts and townships who are hospitalized, about 60% are "hospitalized" for treatment in simple hospital beds attached to rural medical institutions nearby. Their preliminary experience is that the establishment of simple hospital beds attached to rural medical institutions should be based on the needs and medical habits of the local people, as well as the personnel quality, material resources, and especially the technical level of the medical institutions. It should be based on ensuring a certain level of quality, focusing on key areas, and gradually promoting it. Some local health departments have paid special attention to taking various measures in a planned way to improve the quality of rural medical institutions, such as designating county health centers and county hospitals to establish business and technical guidance relationships with medical institutions with attached simple hospital beds, providing them with the convenience of referrals, and, when possible, sending medical personnel to help them solve technical problems. At the same time, local governments also pay attention to helping them overcome difficulties in their work and prevent formalism from the perspective of the local economic level.

    逐步发展乡村简易病床
    河南、云南、四川等省正在进行试点
    本报讯　党的第八次代表大会提出“逐步在乡村发展简易病床”的建议之后，河南、云南、四川等省加强了对这一方面工作的调查研究和领导，经过试点工作，正准备逐步发展。据河南省调查，群众对“乡村简易病床”的反映很好，他们说：“既近，又便利，又便宜”。某些区乡的居民住院人数中，60％左右是就近在乡村医疗机构附设的简易病床“住院”治疗的。他们的初步经验是：目前在乡村医疗机构中附设简易病床，应该根据当地群众的需要与就医习惯，和医疗机构的人员质量、物力等条件，特别是技术水平来决定，应该是在保证一定质量的原则下，重点举办，逐步推广。有的地方卫生部门，特别注意了有计划地采取各种措施，以提高乡村医疗机构的质量，如指定县卫生院、县医院对附设简易病床的医疗机构建立业务技术指导关系，给它们以转院、转诊的便利，可能的时候，选派医务人员下去帮助它们解决技术上的问题。同时，地方政府还注意帮助它们克服工作上的困难，并从当地的经济水平出发，防止形式主义的偏向。
