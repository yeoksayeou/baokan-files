Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, October 10th: Newspapers and news agencies report that the situation in Chile is tense. The government of President Ibáñez, acting on the instructions of American "advisors," is facing serious difficulties.

    Plans are ripe within the armed forces to oppose the government and establish a military dictatorship. Slogans such as "The army demands the dissolution of the National Assembly" have appeared on major streets in the Chilean capital. Rumors of a potential reshuffling of government members are circulating everywhere.

    Newspapers point out that, in order to consolidate its position, the government is striving to gain the support of various political parties and groups. The government has also decided to seek aid from democratic organizations that were previously brutally suppressed and persecuted by the Chilean authorities. According to newspaper reports, President Ibáñez recently met with Castro, the chairman of the Labor Party, which is part of the People's Action Front along with the Communist Party and many other parties. The newspapers pointed out that Castro told the president that his party could only support the government if it abolished the so-called "Law for the Defense of Democracy." This law has been used repeatedly to suppress strikes and persecute progressive parties and groups in Chile; in particular, the Chilean Communist Party has been banned from operating under this law. Ibáñez also called on the United Workers' Confederation of Chile to cooperate with the government. The president invited a delegation led by the Confederation's chairman, Blest, who had been imprisoned for a long time under the Ibáñez government. During the meeting, Ibáñez agreed to request the National Assembly to abolish the "Law for the Defense of Democracy," and said that he was prepared to study the issue of declaring an amnesty for the leaders of the strike movement, as well as other demands put forward by the working people.

　　智利军队想搞军事独裁  政府急向民主组织求援
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯10日讯：据报纸和通讯社报道，智利局势紧张。按照美国“顾问”的指示行事的伊巴涅斯总统的政府已面临严重困难。
    武装部队中正密谋反对政府，建立军事独裁的计划已经酝酿成熟。智利首都各主要大街出现了一些标语，上面写着：“军队要求解散国民大会”。到处流传着政府成员可能变换的谣言。
    报纸指出，为了巩固自己的地位，政府竭力争取各政党和集团的支持。政府还决定向以前遭到智利当局残酷镇压和迫害的民主组织求援。据报纸报道，最近伊巴涅斯总统接见了同共产党和许多其他政党同时加入人民行动战线的劳工党主席卡斯特罗。报纸指出，卡斯特罗对总统说，只有废除所谓“民主保护法”，他的党才能支持政府。这项法律曾多次地被用来镇压罢工和迫害智利的进步党派和进步团体；特别是根据这项法律，智利共产党被禁止进行活动。伊巴涅斯还呼吁智利工人统一工会同政府合作。总统邀请了以统一工会主席布莱斯特为首的代表团，他在伊巴涅斯政府统治下曾长期坐牢。在会见时，伊巴涅斯答应请求国民大会废除“民主保护法”，他说，他准备研究关于宣布大赦罢工运动领袖的问题以及劳动人民所提出的其他要求。
