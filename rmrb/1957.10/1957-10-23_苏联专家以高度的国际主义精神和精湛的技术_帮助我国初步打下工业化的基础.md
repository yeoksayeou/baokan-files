Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: Soviet experts, with a high degree of internationalism and superb technology, have provided enormous assistance to the completion of our country's Five-Year Plan and the preliminary laying of the foundation for industrialization. In capital construction, from the search for resources, the selection of factory and mine sites, the collection of design data, design, construction, mechanical installation, and commissioning, no step has been taken without the guidance of Soviet experts. Soviet experts have provided tremendous assistance in improving our country's industrial production and construction in terms of theory and technology, in the formulation of various norms and methods, and in the promotion of various new technologies.

        Geological Work
    Soviet experts working in the Ministry of Geology have helped our country carry out geological prospecting and exploration work and geological scientific research. They have helped our country identify the mineral reserves needed for the ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal, and some non-metal industrial bases required for the first and second Five-Year Plans. Soviet experts helped us explore large iron ore mines in Anshan, Baotou, Daye, Panzhihua, and Jingtieshan, and helped us explore several manganese ore producing areas in Guizhou, Liaoning, and Guangxi, and established metallurgical coal bases in Henan, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Anhui. Soviet experts have also helped us explore and find a number of non-ferrous metal producing areas in Shanxi, Gansu, Jiangxi, Qinghai, Hunan, Yunnan, Jilin, and Shaanxi, and have also explored and found a number of non-metal producing areas. In terms of hydrogeology and engineering geology, Soviet experts working in the Ministry of Geology have helped us conduct geological surveys and designs for major projects such as the Guanting Reservoir, the Yangtze River Bridge, the Xin'an River Reservoir, the Zhanjiang Seaport, and the Sanmenxia Reservoir. In particular, we had never done underwater drilling for the Yangtze River Bridge before.

        Metallurgical Industry
    Soviet experts working in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have helped our country build a large number of ferrous and non-ferrous metal factories, mines, and enterprises, such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's large rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant, and have also helped our country complete the renovation and expansion of existing iron and steel plants and mines. For our country's newly built metallurgical enterprises, Soviet experts not only specifically guided us on how to construct buildings and install machinery, but also guided us on how to master and use these mechanical equipment for production after they were built. Thanks to the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, we can now design a large joint enterprise with an annual output of 1.5 million tons of steel, including the entire production process from mining and beneficiation to ironmaking and steelmaking. In general, our country's existing iron and steel enterprises have been renovated and expanded after liberation. In the renovation and expansion projects, Soviet experts helped us solve problems such as the future development direction, production scale, workshop composition, and raw material supply of various iron and steel enterprises. This work has a huge impact on the preparation of the fifteen-year long-term plan for the iron and steel industry and the future design work of iron and steel enterprises. Soviet experts from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also helped us formulate long-term development plans for the iron and steel industry and the non-ferrous metal industry, and helped us successfully trial-produce many kinds of steel and steel products in five years, so that the variety of steel in our country could be increased from more than 170 kinds in the early stage of the first Five-Year Plan to more than 370 kinds now, and the variety of steel products could be increased from more than 480 kinds in the early stage of the first Five-Year Plan to about 4,000 kinds now. The rapid improvement of our country's steelmaking and ironmaking technology, the rapid increase in the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, and the completion of the first Five-Year Plan for steel and iron production more than a year ahead of schedule are inseparable from the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts.

        Mechanical Industry
    The fact that our country's mechanical industry has developed from a mechanical repair industry at the time of liberation into a mechanical manufacturing industry is closely related to the assistance of Soviet experts. For example, the Changchun First Automobile Factory, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, the Shenyang First Machine Tool Factory, and the Harbin Boiler Factory have been built and put into production with the help of Soviet experts. Soviet experts working in the First Ministry of Machine Building have also helped us renovate more than ten old factories such as the Dalian Locomotive Factory in the past two years, expanding their scale and greatly increasing their production capacity. Soviet experts have also helped more than 20 existing machine factories carry out technical transformations. They used their original equipment to produce far more products than in the past. For example, the Chongqing Machine Tool Factory used to produce only 30 gear machine tools per year, but after technical transformation, it can produce 30 units in two months. Because our country's original machine factories only had repair and assembly businesses, almost every workshop was arranged according to equipment classification. When these factories progressed to becoming machine manufacturing factories, this arrangement became very unreasonable. A part often had to be transferred everywhere, which was chaotic and time-consuming. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the method of organizing production sections according to production objects is now generally adopted, so that the production of a part is carried out along a technological route. This not only changed the chaotic phenomenon of production, but also greatly improved production efficiency. At present, our country's mechanical industry can produce more than 200 kinds of machine tools, many of which, such as the Heping-type locomotive, were successfully trial-produced under the specific guidance of Soviet experts.
      Coal Industry
    Soviet experts working in the Ministry of Coal Industry, based on the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union and the development of China's coal industry, suggested at the beginning that during the first Five-Year Plan period, we should continue to focus on restoring and renovating existing mines, and actively create conditions to accelerate the construction of new mines. Then, Soviet experts helped us review the potential capacity of various coal mines and helped us find more coal. Soviet experts helped us implement comprehensive technical reforms in existing mines, changing the appearance of the original mines and greatly increasing output. Especially in the first three years of the first Five-Year Plan, 99% of the increase in national coal mine output was due to the increase in existing mines. On the other hand, due to the continuous improvement of coal mining methods, the loss of coal resources was further reduced, and the service life of the mines was extended. Before liberation, coal mine production in our country was very unsafe. Soviet experts put forward a series of suggestions and measures in this regard, and helped us formulate many safety regulations and systems, which greatly improved the safety production situation of coal mines throughout the country. In terms of capital construction, Soviet experts first taught us the advanced technology from geological reconnaissance to detailed investigation. With the help of Soviet experts, 17.6 billion tons of new coal reserves were obtained in five years. Before liberation, no relatively large mine in our country was designed by ourselves. With the help of Soviet experts, we are now not only able to independently undertake the design work of large mines, but also learn to design the world's most advanced hydraulic coal mining mines. With the help of Soviet experts, many of our new mines have completed their tasks ahead of schedule and put into production. For example, the Xiejiaji No. 2 and No. 3 large vertical shafts in Huainan were built in 24 months and 28 months respectively, which is rare in the world.
        Petroleum Industry
    Soviet experts working in the Ministry of Petroleum Industry have given us comprehensive assistance in all aspects of geological exploration, drilling, oil production, refining, synthetic petroleum, and design, laying a preliminary foundation for the development of China's petroleum industry. China has a vast territory. It is a very complex issue to determine where to explore for oil first and how to deploy the workforce in order to find oil more effectively and faster. Thanks to the Soviet experts' help in correctly deploying and planning, avoiding blindness, we were able to discover the Karamay Oilfield, the Huangguashan Petroleum Gully in Sichuan, and the oilfields in Qaidam last year. Soviet experts taught us many new technologies for exploring oil, such as electrical logging, radioactive logging, gas logging, and double-tube wells. In terms of oilfield development, it is necessary to first determine the drive type of the oilfield in order to rationally exploit it and improve the oilfield's recovery rate. However, although the Laojunmiao Oilfield has been exploited for decades, we still cannot determine its drive type and select a reasonable exploitation method. It was not until we received the help of Soviet experts that this problem was solved. In the early days of liberation, Soviet experts helped us restore the synthetic petroleum refineries and natural oil refineries that had been severely damaged by the Kuomintang, and helped us transform the furnace type of dry distillation furnaces, improving the oil recovery rate. Soviet experts guided us to establish coking and polymerization units in the refinery, increasing the light oil recovery rate from 41.41% in 1952 to 51.59% this year. At present, our country's petroleum designers are basically able to design refineries and shale oil plants with a capacity of one million tons, which is also a concrete result of the help of Soviet experts.
        Electric Power Industry
    Soviet experts working in the Ministry of Electric Power Industry guided us to focus on several key technical and economic indicators—coal consumption rate, plant power consumption rate, line loss rate, and equipment utilization hours—for management, and also helped us take many important measures from various aspects to continuously improve these indicators, greatly reducing power generation costs and greatly increasing power generation. In terms of equipment utilization alone, one set of equipment this year is equivalent to the effectiveness of two sets of equipment in the early days of liberation. The technology of burning low-quality coal for power generation taught to us by Soviet experts is also of great economic significance. At present, the proportion of low-quality coal mixed in power plants has reached an average of 36% of the total coal consumption. Soviet experts have also helped us improve boiler efficiency and steam turbine efficiency, and improve the technical management of the power system. Improved the stability and economy of the entire power system operation. In order to more effectively develop China's electric power industry, Soviet experts also helped us formulate long-term development plans. Before our country hired Soviet experts, it was very difficult for us to design a 5,000-kilowatt power plant. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, we are now able to design large power plants with a capacity of 50,000 kilowatts and above on our own. More than one million kilowatts of Soviet power generating equipment has been installed and generated electricity in our country's first Five-Year Plan, and the Soviet Union has sent excellent technical experts to the site to provide guidance throughout the construction process. In terms of hydropower, with the help of Soviet experts, we have surveyed 265 rivers of all sizes in the past few years. By the end of this year, the survey of major rivers across the country will be basically completed. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, we have newly built the Shizitan, Guanting, and Shangyou hydropower stations, and are building the Liuxihe and Xin'anjiang hydropower stations, and expanding and renovating the Fengman, Shangdong, and Shilongba hydropower stations. In particular, Fengman has been transformed from its original state of backward, incomplete equipment and seriously unsafe dams into the first huge new-type hydropower station in the country.
        Chemical Industry
    Soviet experts working in the Ministry of Chemical Industry have helped us build the large-scale modern Jilin Fertilizer Plant, Jilin Dyestuff Plant, Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant, and North China Pharmaceutical Factory and Starch Factory. Last year, there were experts in electric welding, gas cabinets, high-pressure compressors, turbo compressors, high-pressure equipment and pipelines, energy recovery machines, copper ammonia liquid washing equipment, and air separation equipment guiding the installation of equipment at the Jilin Fertilizer Plant. Thanks to the guidance of Soviet experts, the installation efficiency was greatly improved. In the past, the Eighth Mechanical Installation Company of the Fifth General Company of the Ministry of Chemical Industry spent eight months installing a 1,250-horsepower compressor at the Dalian Chemical Plant. Last year, it only took 75 days to install a very large 5,300-horsepower compressor at the Jilin Fertilizer Plant. Last year, Soviet experts guided us through the entire design of the Sichuan Fertilizer Plant, Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, and Shanxi Phosphate Fertilizer Plant. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the nitrogen fertilizer production of the Yongli Ning Plant and the Dalian Chemical Plant has greatly increased. This year, the former increased by 256% compared with 1952, and the latter increased by 480%. With the help of Soviet experts, China's paint industry has successfully trial-produced more than 300 new products of different brands. Many of them are high-grade paints for aircraft, ship bottoms, and telecommunications insulation. With the help of Soviet experts, the plastics industry has completed the trial production of many new products such as plexiglass, polyvinyl chloride, perchloroethylene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and butyraldehyde. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the rubber industry has trial-produced and produced aircraft tires, large-scale sounding balloons, and many new products with extremely strict technical requirements.
    Soviet experts working in other industrial sectors have also provided us with various kinds of assistance.

    苏联专家以高度的国际主义精神和精湛的技术
    帮助我国初步打下工业化的基础
    新华社22日讯　具有高度国际主义精神和精湛技术的苏联专家对我国五年计划的完成和初步打下工业化基础帮助巨大。在基本建设中，从资源的寻找，厂矿地址的选择，设计资料的搜集、设计直到建筑、机械安装和投入生产等各个环节，没有一项离开过苏联专家的指导。苏联专家对我国工业生产和建设在理论和技术的提高上，在各种规范和方法的制定上，在各种新技术的推广上，都作了巨大的帮助。
        地质工作方面
    在地质部工作的苏联专家，帮助我国开展了地质普查勘探工作和地质科学研究工作。帮助我国探明了第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划所需要的黑色金属、有色金属和部分非金属工业基地所需要的矿产储量。苏联专家帮助我们探明了鞍山、包头、大冶、攀枝花、镜铁山等处的大型铁矿，帮助我们在贵州、辽宁、广西探明了几个锰矿产地，建立了河南、内蒙古、山西、甘肃、云南、贵州、安徽的冶金用煤基地。苏联专家还帮助我们探明和找到了山西、甘肃、江西、青海、湖南、云南、吉林、陕西等若干处有色金属产地，还探明和找到了若干处非金属产地。在水文地质与工程地质方面，在地质部工作的苏联专家，帮助我们进行了官厅水库、长江大桥、新安江水库、湛江海港、三门峡水库等重大工程的地质勘察和设计。特别是长江大桥的水上钻探，我们过去完全没有作过。
        冶金工业方面
    在冶金部工作的苏联专家，帮助我国建成了像鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂等的一大批黑色和有色金属工厂矿山企业，又帮助我国完成了旧有钢铁厂矿的改建和扩建。对于我国新建冶金企业苏联专家不仅具体指导我们如何进行建筑如何安装机械，并且在建成后又指导我们如何掌握和运用这些机械设备来进行生产。由于苏联专家的指导和帮助，包括从采矿、选矿到炼铁、炼钢全部生产过程的年产一百五十万吨钢的大型联合企业，我们已可以设计出来。我国旧有钢铁企业，在解放后一般的都进行了改建和扩建。在改建和扩建工程中，苏联专家帮助我们解决了各钢铁企业今后发展的方针、生产规模、车间组成和原料供应等问题。这些工作对于编制钢铁工业十五年远景计划同今后钢铁企业的设计工作有巨大的作用。冶金部的苏联专家还帮助我们作了钢铁工业、有色金属工业的远景发展规划，并且帮助我们在五年中试制成功了许多种钢和钢材，使我国钢的品种能够从第一个五年计划初期的一百七十多种提高到现在的三百七十多种，钢材的品种能够从第一个五年计划初期的四百八十多种提高到现在的四千种左右。我国炼钢炼铁技术的飞快提高，和高炉、平炉利用系数的迅速提高，以及钢、铁产量都提前一年多完成第一个五年计划，都是与苏联专家的指导和帮助分不开的。
        机械工业方面
    我国机械工业能够由解放时的机械修配业发展成为机械制造业，与苏联专家的帮助有密切的关系。如长春第一汽车厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳第一机床厂、哈尔滨锅炉厂等已经在苏联专家的帮助下建成投入生产。在第一机械工业部工作的苏联专家，两年来还帮助我们改建了大连机车厂等十多个老工厂，使它们的规模扩大，生产能力大大提高。苏联专家又帮助二十多个旧有机器厂进行了技术改造。使它们利用原有设备，生产出了比过去多得多的产品。如重庆机床厂过去生产齿轮机床的年产量只有三十台，但是经过技术改造后，两个月就能生产三十台。我国原有机器厂因为只有修配业务，所以，几乎每个车间都是按设备分类来安排的。这些厂进步到成为机器制造厂时，这种布置就很不合理。一个零件往往要到处周转，又乱，费的时间又多。经过苏联专家指导，现在一般都采取了按生产对象组织工段式生产的方法，使一个零件的生产沿着一条工艺路线进行。这样，不仅改变了生产的混乱现象，还大大地提高了生产效率。目前我国机械工业已能生产二百多种机床，其中许多种如和平型机车等就是在苏联专家的具体指导下试制成功的。
      煤炭工业方面
    在煤炭工业部工作的苏联专家，根据苏联先进技术经验和我国煤炭工业的发展情况，一开始就建议：在第一个五年计划期间继续以恢复改建原有矿井为主，并积极创造条件，加速新井建设。接着，苏联专家就帮助我们审查各个煤矿的潜在能力，帮助我们寻找更多的煤炭。苏联专家帮助我们对原有矿井实行了全面技术改革，改变了原有矿井的面貌，大大提高了产量。特别在第一个五年计划的头三年，全国煤矿产量的增加，其中有99％是靠原有矿井增加的。另一方面由于采煤方法的不断改善，进一步减少了煤炭资源的损失，还延长了矿井的服务年限。解放前，我国煤矿生产很不安全，苏联专家在这方面提出了一系列的建议和措施，并帮助我们制订了很多有关安全的规程制度，使全国煤矿的安全生产情况有了很大改进。在基本建设方面，苏联专家首先教我们学会了从地质普查到精查的先进技术，在苏联专家的帮助下，五年中获得新的煤炭储量达一百七十六亿吨。在解放前，我国没有一处比较大的矿井是自己设计的。在苏联专家帮助下，我们现在不仅已能独立担负起大型矿井的设计工作，就连世界上最先进的水力采煤矿井也学会设计了。在苏联专家帮助下，我们不少新井建设都提前完成任务投入生产。如淮南谢家集二、三号大型竖井，就分别用二十四个月和二十八个月的时间建成的，这种速度是世界上少有的。
        石油工业方面
    在石油工业部工作的苏联专家，在地质勘探、钻井、采油、炼油、人造石油和设计等各个环节上给了我们全面的帮助，使我国石油工业的发展打下了初步基础。我国幅员辽阔，应当首先在什么地方勘探石油，如何布置工作力量，以便更有效地更快地找到石油是非常复杂的问题。由于苏联专家帮助我们正确地部署和规划，避免了盲目性，才能在去年发现了克拉玛依油田、四川黄瓜山石油沟等气田和柴达木的油田。苏联专家教给我们许多勘探石油的新技术，如电测法、放射性测井、气测井、双筒井等。在油田开发方面，必须首先确定油田的趋动类型，才能合理开采，提高油田的采收率。但是，在老君庙油田虽然已经开采了几十年，我们还是不能确定它的趋动类型和选用合理的开采方法。直到得到苏联专家的帮助，才解决了这个问题。解放初期，苏联专家帮助我们恢复了被国民党严重破坏的人造石油炼厂和天然油炼厂，帮助我们改造了干馏炉的炉型，提高了采油率。苏联专家指导我们在炼油厂内建立焦化与叠合装置，使轻质油收率由1952年的41.41％提高到今年的51.59％。目前我国石油设计人员基本上已经能设计一百万吨的炼油厂和页岩油厂，这也是苏联专家帮助的具体效果。
        电力工业方面
    在电力工业部工作的苏联专家指导我们抓住几项关系重大的技术经济指标——煤耗率、厂用电率、线路损失率、设备利用小时数等来进行管理，又帮助我们从各方面采取了许多重要措施，不断地改进了这些指标，使发电成本大大降低，发电量大大增加。只设备利用一项，今年一套设备就等于解放初期用两套设备所发挥的效用。苏联专家教给我们烧低质煤发电的技术，也具有非常重大的经济意义。到目前，电厂掺用低质煤的比例平均已达到全部用煤量36％。苏联专家还帮助我们提高了锅炉效率和汽机效率，改进了电力系统的技术管理。提高了整个电力系统运行的稳定性和经济性。为了更有效地发展我国电力工业，苏联专家还帮助我们拟订了远景发展规划。在我国没有聘请苏联专家以前，我们设计一个五千瓩的发电厂都很困难。经过苏联专家的指导，现在五万瓩及以上容量的大型发电厂我们都已能够自行设计了。在我国第一个五年计划内已经安装发电的苏联发电设备一百多万瓩，在整个建设过程苏联都派了优秀的技术专家在现场进行指导。在水电方面，在苏联专家的帮助之下，几年来，我们普查了二百六十五条大小河流。到今年年底，全国主要河流的普查工作就可以基本完成。在苏联专家的指导下面，我们新建了狮子滩、官厅、上犹等水电站，并正在建设流溪河、新安江等水电站，扩建和改建了丰满、上硐、石龙坝等水电站。特别是丰满已由原来设备落后、残缺和堤坝严重不安全的状况变成了国内第一个巨大的新型水电站。
        化学工业方面
    在化学工业部工作的苏联专家，帮助我们建成了规模巨大的现代化的吉林肥料厂、吉林染料厂、吉林电石厂和华北制药厂、淀粉厂。去年，在吉林肥料厂指导设备安装的就有电焊、汽柜、高压压缩机、涡轮压缩机、高压设备及管道、能量回收机、铜氨液洗涤设备、空分设备等方面的专家。由于苏联专家的指导，安装效率大为提高。化学工业部第五总公司第八机装公司过去在大连化工厂安装一台一千二百五十马力的压缩机用了八个月时间，去年在吉林肥料厂安装一台五千三百马力很大的压缩机，却只用了七十五天。去年，苏联专家指导我们进行了四川肥料厂、南京磷肥厂、山西磷肥厂等的全部设计。在苏联专家的指导之下，永利宁厂和大连化学厂的氮肥产量大大提高。今年，前者比1952年提高256％，后者提高480％。我国油漆工业在苏联专家帮助下已试制成功三百多种不同牌号的新产品。其中许多是飞机、船底和电讯绝缘用的高级油漆。塑料工业在苏联专家的帮助下，完成了有机玻璃、聚氯乙烯、过氯乙烯、甲酫、乙酫、丁酫等许多新产品的试制工作。橡胶工业在苏联专家指导下，试制并生产了飞机轮胎、大型探空气球和技术要求极其严格的许多新产品。
    在其他工业部门工作的苏联专家，也对我们作了各种各样的帮助。
