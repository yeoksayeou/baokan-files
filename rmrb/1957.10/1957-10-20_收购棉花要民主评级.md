　　Cotton Procurement Requires Democratic Evaluation
　　Cai Hengwu
    In cotton procurement, it is very important to do a good job in grading and inspection. The quality of this work is related to whether the state's "high quality cotton, high price" policy can be implemented, that is, it is related to the interests of the state and farmers. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, farmers' cotton sales have changed from scattered and decentralized to large-scale and concentrated. If there is a slight deviation in the inspection, its adverse impact will be greater than in the past.
    In order to adapt to the characteristics of farmers' cotton sales after cooperativization, reduce deviations in inspection work, and correctly implement the state's "high quality cotton, high price" policy, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has decided to comprehensively promote the method of democratic evaluation. The so-called democratic evaluation is that the supply and marketing cooperative and the agricultural cooperative jointly negotiate and determine the grade when purchasing cotton, in order to improve the accuracy of the inspection grade. Judging from the trial implementation in some areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Shanxi and other provinces last year, this method has many advantages:
    First, because cotton farmers participate in the democratic evaluation, this prompts the inspection personnel of the purchasing unit to work hard to improve their skills, listen to the opinions of the masses with an open mind, and strengthen their sense of responsibility, thereby effectively preventing the past work style of subjective arbitrariness and sloppy grading, and improving the accuracy of the inspection grade. Last year, the Huaimiao Purchasing Station in Yanshi County, Henan Province, implemented democratic evaluation, and the cotton grading reached complete accuracy.
    Second, it can relieve the purchasing staff of their concerns about inaccurate inspection grades, farmers' dissatisfaction, and criticism from leaders, and increase their confidence in working boldly.
    Third, democratic evaluation can make the relationship between cotton purchasing units and agricultural cooperatives more harmonious, which is conducive to the smooth completion of cotton unified purchase tasks.
    For example, before the Longchang Purchasing Station in Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, implemented democratic evaluation last year, local farmers believed that "the purchasing station's inspection grades are unfair, and farmers always suffer." After the implementation of democratic evaluation, the inspection grades of more than 3,000 dan of cotton purchased were basically correct, and the cotton farmers were satisfied. In Jishan County, Shanxi Province, the problem that the Wudui Agricultural Cooperative was unwilling to sell more than 2,000 jin of cotton because it felt that the grade was too low was solved by implementing democratic evaluation.
    At present, new cotton has been put on the market in large quantities. If the supply and marketing cooperative departments in various cotton-producing areas pay attention to the following points in advance, it is not difficult to do a good job in democratic evaluation.
    First of all, strengthen publicity and education work. Explain the specific requirements and methods of democratic evaluation to agricultural cooperatives in various forms. And explain the reason that adopting this method is good for the country and the farmers, so that the farmers are happy to accept it. When carrying out democratic evaluation, we should widely publicize the state's cotton price policy and quality standards, and teach farmers cotton inspection technology and knowledge to improve cotton quality. In this way, not only can we promote agricultural cooperatives to do a good job in cotton picking, drying, and cleaning, and improve the cotton grade; but also agricultural cooperatives can distinguish the grades in advance, facilitate inspection, and make the democratic evaluation work smoothly. Last year, after the cotton purchasing units in Jishan County, Shanxi Province, imparted cotton inspection technology to agricultural cooperatives, 82.6% of the cotton purchased was graded by the agricultural cooperatives themselves and met the acceptance standards. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei, Jiangsu and other six provinces, the supply and marketing cooperatives have helped agricultural cooperatives train more than 100,000 cotton graders. This is a basic force, and we should pay attention to continuing to improve their skills so that they can play an active role in democratic evaluation.
    Secondly, the key to smoothly promoting democratic evaluation lies in getting through the thinking of cadres. Some cotton inspection cadres believe that democratic evaluation is "creating trouble for themselves" and "creating contradictions for cotton inspection work." This kind of thinking is wrong. Democratic evaluation is the specific application of the Party's mass line in cotton inspection work, and it is an important method to overcome grade and price suppression. Although the implementation of democratic evaluation requires consultation with farmers before grading and pricing, it is by no means an unprincipled concession to some farmers' unreasonable demands. If some people have disputes over the quality of cotton due to unclear understanding, they should patiently explain. If the two parties still cannot reach an agreement, the cotton samples can be sent to the higher authorities for re-inspection. Last year, some areas invited representatives mutually elected by agricultural cooperatives to participate in the evaluation, and reduced and avoided many unnecessary disputes through the method of masses educating the masses. As long as the cotton inspection personnel listen to the opinions of the masses with an open mind, improve their work in a timely manner, continuously improve their technical level, establish a selfless spirit, and handle affairs in accordance with national policies and regulations, it is entirely possible to achieve basic rationality in inspection grades and satisfaction of agricultural cooperatives.

### 收购棉花要民主评级

　　收购棉花要民主评级
　　蔡恨吾
    在棉花收购中，作好分级检验工作很重要。这个工作的好坏，关系到国家的“优棉优价”政策能否贯彻，也即是关系国家与农民的利益。尤其在农业合作化以后，农民售棉由零星分散转变为量大集中，检验时若稍有偏差，其不良影响比过去要大得多。
    为了适应合作化后农民售棉的特点，减少检验工作中的偏差，正确地贯彻国家“优棉优价”政策，全国供销合作总社决定全面推广民主评级的办法。所谓民主评级，就是在收购棉花的时候供销合作社与农业社共同协商定级，以提高验级准确程度。从去年江苏、浙江、河南、山西等省部分地区试行的情况来看，这个办法有许多好处：
    第一，由于民主评级有售棉农参加，这就促使收购单位的检验人员努力提高技术，虚心听取群众意见，加强工作责任心，从而有效地防止过去那种主观臆断草率定级的工作作风，提高了验级的准确性。去年河南偃师县槐庙采购站实行了民主评级，棉花定级达到完全正确。
    第二，可以解除收购人员怕验级不准、农民不满、领导上批评等等的思想顾虑，增加大胆进行工作的信心。
  第三，通过民主评级使收棉单位与农业社的关系更为融洽，有利于棉花统购任务的顺利完成。
    例如浙江慈溪县龙场采购站去年在没有实行民主评级以前，当地农民认为“采购站验级不公平，农民总是吃亏”。实行民主评级以后，收购三千多担棉花的验级基本正确，棉农感到满意。山西稷山县由于实行了民主评级，解决了坞堆农业社二千多斤棉花嫌等级验低不愿出售的问题。
    目前新棉已大量上市，各产棉区供销合作部门如果事先注意以下几点，作好民主评级工作是不难的。
    首先，加强宣传教育工作。把民主评级的具体要求和作法，通过各种形式向农业社交代清楚。并且说明采用这个办法对国家对农民都有好处的道理，使农民乐于接受。在开展民主评级的时候，应广泛宣传国家棉价政策和品质标准，把棉花检验技术和提高棉花质量的知识教给农民。这样作，不但能推动农业社做好棉花采摘和晒干拣净工作，提高棉花品级；而且农业社还能事先分清等级，便利检验，使民主评级工作顺利地进行。去年山西稷山县的收棉单位，对农业社传授了棉检技术以后，收购棉花中，由农业社自行定级，合乎验收标准的占82.6％。根据目前河北、江苏等六省的不完全统计，供销社已帮助农业社训练了棉花分级员十万余人。这是一批基本力量，应该注意继续提高他们的技术，以便在民主评级中发挥积极作用。
    其次，顺利推行民主评级的关键问题还在于打通干部思想。有些棉花检验干部认为民主评级是“给自己找麻烦”，是“给棉检工作制造矛盾。”这种思想是错误的。民主评级是党的群众路线在棉花检验工作上的具体运用，是目前克服压级压价的一种重要方法。实行民主评级固然要同农民协商后才能定级定价，但决不是无原则迁就某些农民不合理的要求。部分群众如果对棉花质量因认识不清而有争执时，应该耐心解释。双方意见仍不能取得一致，还可以将棉样送请上级复验。去年有的地区邀请农业社互推代表参加评级，通过群众教育群众的方法，减少和避免了许多不必要的纠纷。只要棉检人员虚心听取群众意见，及时改进工作，不断提高技术水平，树立大公无私精神，并依据国家政策和规定办事，做到验级基本合理和农业社满意是完全可能的。
