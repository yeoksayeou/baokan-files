Beijing Local State-Owned Joint State-Private Enterprises Launch Rectification Movement
Mobilizing the Masses to Solve Problems Quickly and Effectively

(Our newspaper's reporter, Yu Yaofu, reports) The first group of state-owned, joint state-private enterprises, and cooperatives in Beijing to launch the rectification movement are vigorously solving problems and improving work after extensive airing of views.

According to the person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee's Local Industry Department, the first batch of enterprises in the city to carry out rectification totaled 209 units (excluding central state-owned enterprises), including more than 85,000 employees. These units have solved problems faster and better than usual after extensively airing views.

Employees' opinions on production management accounted for more than 30% of the total. Among them, the leadership seized the opportunity, concentrated its efforts, and generally resolved issues that could be resolved immediately. Workers at the Guanghua Timber Factory reported that using eight-meter timber as five- or six-meter material was a great waste, and this had been raised before but never resolved. This time, the factory leadership accepted the workers' opinions, and the problem was quickly resolved, saving the country more than 30,000 yuan. Workers in the Western Clothing Workshop of the Beijing Garment Factory reported that there were surplus machines stored in the warehouse, but there were not enough spare sewing machines for production, so work stopped as soon as there was an accident, which greatly affected production. This issue has also been resolved.

Many units have also improved production management by focusing on streamlining institutions based on employee feedback. The Qinghe Woolen Mill reduced its thirteen departments to five, and the number of management personnel was reduced from 212 to 114, so that the proportion of the total number of employees can be reduced from the original 9.8% to 5.3%. Other units, such as the Glass Factory, Yanjing Paper Mill, Chemical Reagent Factory, Guanghua Timber Factory, and Beijing Machinery Factory, have also formulated preliminary plans to simplify their organizations, which can be implemented after approval by higher authorities.

Many enterprises have solved some problems concerning the welfare of employees, in the spirit of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. For example, there are no cooperatives near the Yanjing Paper Mill, and more than 1,000 workers and hundreds of family members have to travel two or three miles to the city to buy things. After the workers raised their opinions this time, the factory director personally found the relevant unit to open a cooperative nearby, which made everyone happy.

During the rectification and improvement process, cadres generally attach importance to contacting the masses. Most of the cadres who have been criticized have adopted methods such as big-character posters, symposiums, door-to-door visits, individual talks, or public self-criticism to the masses at certain meetings. The masses reacted well after more than a dozen section chiefs and higher-level cadres in the Guanghua Timber Factory did this. The special treatment of certain leading cadres is also being quickly corrected. Most factories held employee representative conferences or employee conferences in September to report to the masses on the rectification and improvement, and to solicit the opinions of the masses. Some factories also organized employee representatives and veteran workers to jointly inspect the implementation, and reported the inspection results to the employee representative meeting. In this way, problems are solved quickly and effectively.

However, there are still some problems in the previous stage of rectification and improvement that need to be paid attention to. Some factories' rectification and improvement were not systematic or concentrated, but piecemeal, and the masses said they were "patching holes" and "applying plasters"; some units did not seriously listen to the opinions of the masses, and spent too much time studying the ways and methods of handling them. Some units lacked a comprehensive view and made promises casually; individual units even did not attach importance to the opinions of the masses. The masses of the Joint State-Private Cement Products Factory raised 2,544 opinions, but only 27 were resolved by September 25, and the workers were very dissatisfied, posting more than a dozen big-character posters every day to question why the leaders did not solve the problems.

The person in charge of the Municipal Party Committee's Local Industry Department believes that in order to thoroughly improve work, the various district committees should seize the leadership of the various enterprises, help them carefully analyze the opinions of the masses, rely on the masses, and improve their work. Full preparations should be made for the streamlining of institutions. Issues involving the entire city should be resolved uniformly by the Municipal Industrial Bureau and relevant units.

　　北京地方国营公私合营企业开展整风运动
    群众发动起来解决问题又快又好
    本报讯　记者余药夫报道，北京市地方国营、公私合营企业和合作社第一批开展整风的单位经过大鸣大放，都在大力解决问题，改进工作。
    据中共北京市委地方工业部负责人谈，全市第一批开展整风的企业共有二百零九个单位（没包括中央国营企业），包括职工八万五千多人。这些单位经过大鸣大放，解决问题比平时又快又好。
    职工对生产管理工作上的意见约占总数的30％以上。其中领导上抓住时机，集中力量，能马上解决的一般都已解决。光华木材厂工人反映，把八米的木材当五、六米的材料来用，浪费很大，过去提了一直没解决。这次，厂的领导接受工人意见，使问题很快得到解决，为国家节约了三万多元。北京被服厂西服车间工人反映，厂内有多余的机器积存仓库，而生产上没有多预备缝纫机，一出事故就停工，很影响生产。这次也解决了。
    许多单位还根据职工意见，抓住紧缩机构这个环节，改进生产管理。清河制呢厂，将十三个科室合并为五个科，管理人员由二百一十二名减为一百一十四人，占全体职工的比例可由原来的9.8％降为5.3％。其他如玻璃厂、燕京造纸厂、化学试剂厂、光华木材厂和北京机械厂等单位，都已订出初步简化机构方案，待上级批准后即可实行。
    许多企业都本着勤俭办企业的精神，解决了职工生活福利上的一些问题。如燕京造纸厂附近没有合作社，一千多工人和几百名家属买东西都要跑二、三里到城里来买。这次工人们提出意见后，厂长亲自找到有关单位就近开办一个合作社，人人都高兴。
    边整边改中，干部一般都重视联系群众。受到批评的干部大都采取大字报、座谈会、登门拜访、个别谈心的方式，或者在一定的会上向群众公开检讨。光华木材厂十几个科长以上的干部这样做了之后，群众反映很好。某些领导干部待遇特殊化的地方也在迅速纠正。大部分工厂在9月份普遍召开了职工代表大会或职工大会，向群众报告了边整边改的情况，征求群众的意见。有的厂还组织职工代表和老工人共同检查执行情况，并将检查结果向职工代表会议报告。这样问题解决得又快又好。
    但是，在前一段边整边改中还存在一些问题，需要引起注意。有的厂子边整边改不系统，不集中，零打碎敲，群众说他们是“堵窟窿”、“贴膏药”；有的单位不认真听取群众意见，过多的去研究处理的方式方法。还有些单位缺乏全面观点，随便许愿；个别单位甚至不重视群众意见。公私合营水泥制品厂群众提了二千五百四十四条意见，到9月25日才解决二十七件，工人很不满意，每天都贴出十来张大字报质问领导为什么不解决问题。
    市委地方工业部负责人认为，为了彻底改进工作，各个区委应抓紧对各企业的领导，帮他们认真分析群众意见，依靠群众，改进工作。紧缩机构工作要作好充分准备。牵涉到全市性的问题，更应由市工业局和有关单位统一解决。
