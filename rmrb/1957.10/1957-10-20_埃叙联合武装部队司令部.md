　　Joint Command of the Egyptian-Syrian Armed Forces

　　On October 13, the Joint Command of the Egyptian-Syrian Armed Forces announced that Egyptian troops had moved into Syria. The armed forces of the two countries, under the command of a unified command, will combat possible acts of aggression against Syria by Turkish troops in the north and Israeli troops in the south under the direction of US imperialism.

　　The Joint Command of the Egyptian-Syrian Armed Forces was established in accordance with the Egyptian-Syrian Joint Defense Treaty signed on October 20, 1955. The treaty states that Egypt and Syria "affirm their commitment to maintaining peace and security and are determined to resolve all their international disputes by peaceful means." The treaty declares that if there is "any armed aggression against either of them or the army of either of them, it will be considered an aggression against both of them." "Each of the two countries guarantees that in the event of aggression, it will immediately provide assistance to the other country, using all means at their disposal, including the use of armed forces to repel aggression and restore peace and security." To achieve this goal, the two sides agreed to establish three bodies: the Supreme Council, the Military Committee, and the Joint Armed Forces Command.

　　The Joint Armed Forces Command is located in Cairo. It is of a permanent nature and operates equally in peacetime and wartime. The treaty stipulates that both countries shall place all their armed forces under the command of the Joint Command in peacetime and wartime. The command has a commander-in-chief, followed by a committee composed of the chiefs of staff of various forces.

　　The conclusion of the Joint Defense Agreement and the establishment of the Joint Armed Forces Command and other related institutions have struck a blow at the imperialists' ambitions to invade the Middle East. It is in the interests of both Egypt and Syria, and is conducive to the peace, unity and common security of the Middle Eastern countries.

　　The current first commander-in-chief of the Joint Command is Major General Abdel Hakim Amer, the Egyptian Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces. He was appointed by the Egyptian-Syrian Supreme Council on November 8, 1955. General Amer is forty-eight years old. He was one of the core figures who led the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. After the victory of the revolution, he became a member of the former Egyptian Revolutionary Guidance Committee. In the patriotic war against the British, French, and Israeli aggressors last year, he commanded the Egyptian army in battle. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　埃叙联合武装部队司令部
    10月13日，埃及—叙利亚联合武装部队司令部宣布，埃及军队已经开到叙利亚。两国军队将在统一的司令部指挥下，打击可能发生的在美帝国主义指使下北方的土耳其军队和南方的以色列军队对叙利亚的侵略行动。
    埃及—叙利亚联合武装部队司令部是根据1955年10月20日签订的埃及—叙利亚共同防御条约而建立起来的。这个条约声明：埃及和叙利亚两国“确认它们致力于维持和平与安全，并且决心以和平方法解决它们一切的国际争端”。条约申明：如果发生了“对它们之中的任何一国或任何一国的军队进行的任何武装侵略，都将被认为是对它们两国进行的侵略”。“两国之中的每一国保证：在万一发生侵略时，将立即给予另一国以援助，利用它们所有一切办法，包括使用武装力量来击退侵略和恢复和平与安全”。为了实现这个目标，双方同意建立三个机构：最高委员会、军事委员会和联合武装部队司令部。
    联合武装部队司令部设在开罗。它是常设性质的，在平时和战时都同样进行工作。条约规定，两国将在平时和战时都把它们的所有武装部队交给联合司令部统率。司令部设总司令一人，下面还包括由各部队参谋长组成的委员会。
    共同防御协定的订立和联合武装部队司令部及其他有关机构的建立，打击了帝国主义者侵略中东的野心。它既符合于埃及、叙利亚两国的利益，也有利于中东国家的和平、团结与共同安全。
    联合司令部的现任首届总司令是埃及国防部长兼埃及武装部队总司令阿卜杜勒·哈基姆·阿密尔少将。他是1955年11月8日由埃叙最高委员会任命的。阿密尔将军现年四十八岁，他是领导1952年埃及革命的核心人物之一，革命胜利后，他成为前埃及革命指导委员会的委员。在去年反击英、法、以色列三国侵略军的卫国战争中，他统率埃及军队作战。  （新华社）
