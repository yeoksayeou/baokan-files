Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: Premier Kadar stated tonight at a banquet held by the Hungarian Ambassador to China to welcome the Hungarian government delegation's visit to China: "The People's Republic of China and the Hungarian People's Republic hold identical views on important issues in all international relations."

Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai attended tonight's banquet.

Premier Kadar's speech at the banquet (full text on page two) first addressed the respect and affection he received during his visit to China, as well as the discussions between the leaders of Hungary and China in Beijing. He said that the talks clearly demonstrated that "our views are consistent on such an important international political issue as the unity of the people of all countries building socialism and the further strengthening of this unity. We have a consistent understanding and common will regarding the necessity of exposing and counterattacking the conspiracies and provocations of imperialists to undermine the national independence of the people of certain countries and endanger world peace. We fully agree that all possible steps must be taken to ease international tensions and to enable all countries, regardless of their internal systems, and all peoples, regardless of where they live, to coexist peacefully and amicably."

Premier Kadar said: "All Chinese and Hungarian comrades participating in the negotiations share the same deep desire: to promote better understanding between us, to strengthen and expand our existing multifaceted cooperation, and to never allow the friendship between the two fraternal peoples—the Chinese people and the Hungarian people—to be damaged, for the benefit of our two peoples and our common great goals."

Finally, Premier Kadar once again condemned the recent frantic attacks and slanders launched by imperialists against Hungary.

Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke at the banquet (full text on page two). He said that the distinguished guests' visit to our country and the cordial talks between the leaders of the two governments "have not only further deepened mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between our two countries but also strengthened the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the noble cause of maintaining world peace."

Hungarian Ambassador to China Nogradi also gave a speech and toast at the beginning of the banquet.

Also invited to attend the banquet were Vice Premiers Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, Deng Zihui, and He Long, Vice Chairman Shen Junru, President Dong Biwu, Vice Minister Zhang Wentian, as well as people from all walks of life in China and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China, totaling more than 500 people.

Chairman of the Federal National Assembly of Yugoslavia, Stanboulic, and other foreign delegations visiting Beijing were also invited to attend tonight's banquet.

The Hungarian Debrecen Folk Song and Dance Troupe gave a brilliant performance at the banquet.
