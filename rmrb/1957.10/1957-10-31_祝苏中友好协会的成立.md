    Congratulations on the Establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    We are very excited to warmly congratulate the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
    The establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is good news for the people of China and the Soviet Union. It is of great significance for further strengthening the fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union, thereby promoting world peace and the cause of human progress.
    The people of China and the Soviet Union have always had a traditional, brotherly, and profound friendship. The salvo of the October Revolution opened up a new path for the friendship and solidarity between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Over the past forty years, through difficult years and common battles, especially after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship between our two peoples has greatly developed. This is because our two peoples have a common ideal—communism—and because our two peoples have a common ideological foundation—Marxism-Leninism. The friendship between our two peoples is built on such a common and lofty ideal. The solidarity of our two peoples is built on such an unbreakable ideological foundation.
    Today, China and the Soviet Union not only carry out comprehensive cooperation in the construction undertakings of the two countries, but also provide mutual support and close cooperation in the cause of defending world peace and promoting human progress. The unity of China and the Soviet Union has now become an important link in the great unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and a reliable guarantee for the advancement of world peace and the cause of human progress. The people of our country deeply understand the great significance of the friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, they regard the continuous development and consolidation of our fraternal friendship and alliance with the Soviet people as their most sacred duty.
    The Chinese people have always regarded the great Soviet people as their example. For many years, the people of our country have drawn tremendous strength from the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction of the Soviet people and learned from the rich experience of the Soviet people in revolution and construction, thereby enabling us to overcome various difficulties and obstacles on the road of advancement more quickly, defeat the enemy more quickly, and achieve the victory of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and to obtain great achievements in socialist construction more smoothly. Striving to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union has been, is, and will continue to be the firm and unwavering policy of the people of our country.
    The Chinese people will never forget the great support and assistance given by the Soviet people to the people of our country in revolution and construction. In the various revolutionary war periods, the existence of the powerful Soviet Union, the moral and spiritual support of the Soviet people, and direct and indirect assistance were important conditions for the people of our country to smoothly overthrow the dark rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and achieve the great victory of the people's revolution. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, the Soviet government and people gave us comprehensive, selfless, and huge assistance. The Soviet Union helped our country restore its national economy and smoothly develop the cause of socialist construction through preferential loans, development of trade, supply of complete sets of equipment and technical materials, dispatch of experts, and scientific, technological, and cultural cooperation. The 211 industrial enterprises built by the Soviet government to help our country have become the center of our socialist construction. Therefore, the revolutionary victory and the great achievements already made in socialist construction in our country are inseparable from the support and assistance of the Soviet people.
    The establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is a new link in the comprehensive cooperative relationship that has been established between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Comrade Andreyev, Chairman of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, pointed out at the inaugural meeting that the task of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is to promote the further development and consolidation of the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, expand cultural cooperation, and comprehensively exchange experience in cultural construction with the People's Republic of China, introduce the life and socialist construction experience of the Chinese people to all walks of life in the Soviet Union more widely, and help the Chinese people fully understand the life and labor of the Soviet people. We Chinese people wholeheartedly cheer the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, sincerely welcome the lofty purpose of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and wish it great achievements in its work. Long live the rock-solid friendship of the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union!

    祝苏中友好协会的成立
    我们怀着十分兴奋的心情，热烈地祝贺苏中友好协会的成立。
    苏中友好协会的成立，是中苏两国人民的喜讯，它对于进一步加强苏中两国的兄弟友谊，从而对于促进世界和平和人类进步事业具有重要的意义。
    中苏两国人民一向具有传统的兄弟般的深厚友谊。十月革命的一声炮响，打开了中苏两国人民友好团结的新道路。四十年来，经过了艰难的岁月，经过了共同的战斗，特别是在中华人民共和国成立以后，我们两国人民的友谊得到了巨大的发展。这是因为我们两国人民有着共同的理想——共产主义，因为我们两国人民有着共同的思想基础——马克思列宁主义。我们两国人民的友谊，就是建立在这样的共同的崇高的理想上。我们两国人民的团结，就是建立在这样牢不可破的思想基础上。
    今天，中苏两国不仅在两国的建设事业中实行全面的合作，而且在保卫世界和平和促进人类进步的事业中，也进行着互相支援和密切合作。中苏两国的团结，现在已经成为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营伟大团结的重要一环，成为世界和平和人类进步事业向前发展的可靠保证。我国人民深刻地了解中苏两国人民的友谊和团结的伟大意义，因此把不断地发展和巩固我们同苏联人民的兄弟友谊和联盟，看成是自己最神圣的义务。
    中国人民一直以伟大的苏联人民为自己的榜样。多少年来，我国人民从苏联人民的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大事业中吸取了巨大的力量，学习了苏联人民的革命和建设的丰富经验，从而使我们能够较快地克服了前进道路上的种种困难和障碍，较快地战胜了敌人，取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，并且较顺利地在社会主义建设中获得巨大的成就。努力学习苏联的先进经验，过去是、现在是、将来仍然是我国人民的坚定不移的方针。
    中国人民永远不会忘记苏联人民对我国人民在革命和建设中所给予的伟大的支持和援助。在各个革命战争时期，强大的苏联的存在、苏联人民道义上和精神上的支持以及直接的间接的援助，是我国人民能够顺利地推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的黑暗统治，取得了人民革命伟大胜利的重要条件。在中华人民共和国建立以后，根据中苏友好同盟互助条约和其他各项协定，苏联政府和人民给了我们以全面的无私的巨大援助。苏联通过优惠贷款、发展贸易、供应成套设备和技术资料、派遣专家和科学技术文化合作等方式，帮助我国恢复了国民经济，顺利地发展了社会主义的建设事业。苏联政府帮助我国建设的二百十一项工业企业，已经成为我国社会主义建设的中心。因此，我国人民的革命胜利和社会主义建设已经取得的伟大成就，都是同苏联人民的支持和援助分不开的。
    苏中友好协会的成立，是中苏两国人民之间已经建立起来的全面合作关系的新的一环。苏中友好协会主席安德烈耶夫在成立大会上指出：苏中友好协会的任务是，促进中苏两国人民之间的兄弟友谊和合作的进一步发展和巩固，扩大文化合作，并且同中华人民共和国全面地交流文化建设的经验，更广泛地向苏联各界介绍中国人民的生活和社会主义建设的经验，帮助中国人民全面地了解苏联人民的生活和劳动。我们中国人民衷心地欢呼苏中友好协会的成立，真诚地欢迎苏中友好协会的崇高的宗旨，并祝它在工作中获得巨大的成就。中苏两国八亿人民的坚如磐石的友谊万岁！
