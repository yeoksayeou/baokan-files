Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, October 14th: Kadar, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Premier of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, reported to the national conference of party activists on October 11th on the achievements of the Hungarian government delegation's visit to China. He also discussed some international and domestic issues and extended his heartfelt congratulations on the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite.

"People's Freedom Daily" published Kadar's long report, which amounted to ten thousand words, in a huge layout on the 13th.

    Strengthening the Friendship Between the Chinese and Hungarian People

Kadar said in his report that the visit to China gave Hungarian communists and state cadres many valuable things. He spoke of China's ancient culture, the people's hard work, and noble moral qualities, and then of the tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects over the past eight years. Kadar said that the victory of the Chinese people was achieved through a long period of armed struggle, and since then, rapid progress has been made. This is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the unity of the people. The historical experience of the CCP and China has a great effect on the entire socialist world, the entire international workers' movement, and all anti-colonialist people.

Regarding the rectification movement of the Chinese Communist Party, Kadar said that the rectification movement carried out by the Chinese Party prevented the mistakes of some people from becoming serious. The CCP leaders are very clear that there will be various incorrect views in the movement, and they also know that the entire party and the people will be tempered in this struggle. Kadar pointed out that the Chinese bourgeois rightists took the opportunity of the rectification movement to launch an attack on the Party and the government, which was countered. Currently, in this struggle, the socialist forces have won a complete victory, and the bourgeois rightist forces have been completely defeated.

Talking about the question of "who will win," Kadar said that we have a people's regime here, the armed forces are in the hands of the people, and the economic foundation is socialist. However, people's political thoughts have not changed as rapidly as socialist construction. On this issue, the question of "who will win" in Hungary has not been finally resolved.

Referring to the meeting between the Hungarian government delegation and Chairman Mao Zedong, Kadar said that the first sentence Comrade Mao Zedong said to the delegation was: The Hungarian comrades have fought well. Mao Zedong believed that the Hungarian events of October last year had a positive side, and he was convinced that the Hungarian Party and state are stronger today than before the events, and the Hungarian People's Republic has become stronger after the counter-revolutionary events. The entire international workers' movement has also drawn good experience from the Hungarian events. Kadar said that the Chinese comrades' analysis and research of the events are also worth learning from. We should deeply analyze these events and draw the necessary lessons from them and implement them into action.

Talking about the gains of the talks between the Chinese and Hungarian government delegations, Kadar said that the visit to China and the results of the bilateral talks strengthened the friendship between the two peoples, strengthened the unity of socialist countries, and strengthened Hungary's international position.

    Friendly Relations with Fraternal Countries

Kadar said that the ideological exchanges we have conducted with the Soviet Union, China, Romania, and Czechoslovakia in various forms prove that we have a very close friendship. He also said that we heartily congratulate the Polish people and the Polish leadership for crushing the anti-socialist provocations that took place in Warsaw not long ago, and we believe that this will help strengthen the unity of socialist countries. The formal organization of the youth of Warsaw University and the majority of young people did not participate in this provocative activity, which is a good lesson for us, especially for some organizations of our university youth.

Speaking of relations with Yugoslavia, Kadar said that Hungarian-Yugoslav relations are continuing to improve. In the past few months, the two countries have signed several agreements, which are beneficial to the people of both countries.

    Endorsing Khrushchev's Talk with American Journalists

Kadar expressed his full agreement with Khrushchev's recent talk with a "New York Times" reporter. He said that we are willing to work to establish normal relations with the United States and other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The reason why this has not yet been achieved is not due to us.

When talking about the domestic situation, Kadar said that our country has stood firmly. If the counter-revolutionaries dare to provoke again, they will suffer an even more shameful defeat. However, this does not mean that we can be without vigilance. We should also strengthen the discipline, friendship, and unity of the armed forces and the workers' guards.

Kadar said that the Patriotic People's Front should be strengthened. The Patriotic People's Front is not only an organization for non-Party members, but also an organization of the Communist Party and the cooperation between the Party and non-Party members. This organization must work under the leadership of the Communist Party.

    Establishment of "Factory Committees"

Regarding the workers' committees, Kadar said that the workers' committees that were produced under abnormal conditions last year should not be maintained. The vast majority of these workers' committees no longer exist in practice. In order to promote democracy in the factories and enable workers to effectively oppose bureaucracy and all kinds of bad phenomena, new organizations must be established, which may be called "factory committees." In this organization, the trade union will play a leading role, and representatives of all workers should be absorbed to participate. This task must be completed this year.

    The Necessity of Consolidating the Party's Ranks

Kadar finally talked about the necessity of consolidating the Party's ranks. He said that if the Party is disciplined, then the whole country will be disciplined. If the Party is united, then any problem can be solved. The past work was a stage of restoring order within the Party and the People's Republic. Now we have entered such a period: what lies before us are normal tasks and normal life. The conditions for completing the tasks are better now, but the tasks themselves are more complicated. Communists should become politically brave and strong people in achieving their goals, and they should clearly see the prospects for development.

　　卡达尔谈国际和国内问题
    匈牙利已由恢复阶段进入正常建设时期
    据新华社布达佩斯14日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记、工农革命政府总理卡达尔，10月11日向全国党的积极分子大会报告了匈牙利政府代表团访问中国的成就。他还谈到国际、国内的一些问题，并且对苏联放射第一个人造卫星表示衷心的祝贺。
    “人民自由报”13日以巨大的篇幅刊载了卡达尔这篇长达万言的报告。
    加强中匈两国人民的友谊
    卡达尔在报告中说，访问中国给了匈牙利共产主义者和国家干部们很多宝贵的东西。他从中国古代的文化、人民的辛勤劳动和高尚的道德品质，谈到了最近八年来中国人民在各方面取得的巨大成就。卡达尔说，中国人民的胜利是经过长期武装斗争而取得的，胜利以后，又取得了迅速的进展。这主要是由于中国共产党的正确领导和人民内部的团结一致。中共和中国的历史经验对整个社会主义世界、整个国际工人运动以及一切反殖民主义的人们，都有很大的作用。
    关于中国共产党的整风运动，卡达尔说，中国党所进行的整风运动使得有些人的错误不致严重起来。中共领导人很清楚，在运动中会有各种不正确的观点出现，也知道全党和人民都将在这次斗争中受到锻炼。卡达尔指出，中国资产阶级右派乘整风运动的机会向党和政府发动的进攻遭到了反击。目前在这个斗争中，社会主义力量已经获得全胜，资产阶级右派力量遭到全败。
    谈到“谁战胜谁”的问题，卡达尔说，我们这里有人民政权，武装力量掌握在人民手中，经济基础是社会主义的。但是，人们的政治思想还没有像社会主义建设那样迅速地转变。在这个问题上，匈牙利的“谁战胜谁”的问题还没有最后解决。
    谈到匈牙利政府代表团同毛泽东主席的会晤，卡达尔说，毛泽东同志对代表团说的第一句话是：匈牙利同志们斗争得很好。毛泽东认为，匈牙利去年十月的事件有积极的一面，并且深信，匈牙利党和国家今天比事件以前坚强了，匈牙利人民共和国经过反革命事件以后变得坚强了。整个国际工人运动也从匈牙利事件中吸取了很好的经验。卡达尔说，中国同志们对事件的分析和研究也是值得我们学习的。我们应深刻地分析这些事件，并且从中取得必要的教训，贯彻到行动中去。
    谈到中匈两国政府代表团会谈的收获，卡达尔说，这次访问中国和双方会谈的结果加强了两国人民的友谊，加强了社会主义国家的团结，也加强了匈牙利的国际地位。
    同兄弟国家的友好关系
    卡达尔说，我们同苏联、中国、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克通过各种形式进行的思想交流证明，我们中间有着非常亲密的友好关系。他又说，我们衷心地祝贺波兰人民和波兰的领导粉碎了不久以前在华沙发生的反对社会主义的挑衅，并且认为，这是有助于加强社会主义国家的团结的。华沙大学青年的正式组织和大多数青年没有参加这种挑衅活动，这对我们、尤其是对我们大学青年的某些组织来讲，都是一个很好的教训。
    卡达尔在谈到同南斯拉夫的关系时说，匈南关系正在继续好转。在过去几个月中，两国签订了几个协定，这对两国人民都是有利的。
    赞成赫鲁晓夫对美记者的谈话
    卡达尔表示完全赞同赫鲁晓夫最近对“纽约时报”记者的谈话。他说，我们愿意努力同美国以及北大西洋公约组织的其他国家建立正常关系。现在还没有作到这一点的原因不在于我们。
    在谈到国内状况的时候，卡达尔说，我们国家已经坚强地站立起来了。反革命分子如果胆敢重新挑衅，他们将遭到更可耻的失败。但是，这并不是说，可以不加警惕了。我们还应当加强武装力量和工人纠察队的纪律、友谊和团结。
    卡达尔说，应该加强爱国人民阵线。爱国人民阵线不仅是非党人士的组织，而且也是共产党的以及党同非党人士合作的组织。这个组织必须在共产党的领导下进行工作。
    成立“工厂委员会”
    关于工人委员会，卡达尔说，在去年不正常条件下产生的工人委员会不应当加以保持。这种工人委员会的绝大多数实际上已经不存在了。为了发扬工厂中的民主，使工人有效地反对官僚主义以及一切不良现象，必须建立新的组织，这种组织可能就称为“工厂委员会”。在这种组织内，工会将起领导作用，并且要吸收所有的工人代表参加。这个任务必须在今年完成。
    巩固党的队伍的必要性
    卡达尔最后谈到了巩固党的队伍的必要性。他说，如果党内是有纪律的，那么全国也将是纪律严明的。如果党是团结一致的，那么任何问题都能够解决。过去的工作是恢复党内和人民共和国内秩序的阶段。现在我们已经进入这样的时期：摆在我们面前的是正常的任务和正常的生活。完成任务的条件目前是比较好了，但是任务本身却复杂了一些。共产主义者在达到自己的目的方面应该成为政治上勇敢、坚强的人，他们应该清楚地看到发展的前途。
