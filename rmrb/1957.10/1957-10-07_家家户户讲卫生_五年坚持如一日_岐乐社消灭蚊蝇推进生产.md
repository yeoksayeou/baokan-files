Every Household Practices Hygiene; Five Years of Consistent Effort
Qile Cooperative Eliminates Mosquitoes and Flies, Promotes Production

Can "four pests" be basically eliminated in the countryside within a certain period? Can the masses' patriotic health campaign for increased production be launched and sustained? In other words, can the 27th goal stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) be achieved? The facts from the Qile Agricultural and Forestry Production Cooperative in Leyi County, Guangdong Province, prove that the answer is a definite yes.

"The Place Where Plague Breaks Out"

Qile Cooperative is located in a mountainous area with abundant forest resources. However, during the Kuomintang rule, dysentery, malaria, and other epidemics were prevalent every year, the population mortality rate was very high, and the peasants lived in extreme poverty. In 1937, there were originally more than 600 people here, but by the time of liberation in 1949, only 511 people remained. Farmer Ting Shengcai's family of five lost three members to dysentery within four days one year. Farmer Ting Shuiqi's family of four also lost two brothers to dysentery, leaving him and his mother, who also suffered from malignant malaria and were unable to work for many years. The most serious case was Tangjia Cave, where more than 40 households lost 24 children to a dysentery outbreak in the autumn of 1947. At that time, Qile Village was known as the "place where plague breaks out," and the saying "No daughters should marry into Qile Village" circulated in neighboring villages. In this atmosphere of terror caused by disease, the peasants relied on "Guan Yin" and "holy water" to sustain their fate, but "Guan Yin" did not manifest her power, and the plague continued to rage terribly.

Two Mobilizations, Two Failures

After liberation, the Party and the government launched health campaigns here. In February 1952, in order to oppose the bacteriological warfare waged by American imperialism, the district committee planned to launch an epidemic prevention and health campaign here first, but only some vague propaganda was carried out among the masses. The broad masses were not mobilized, and no one was willing to do anything. In August of the same year, the district committee sent people again, asking the masses to stop production and engage in cleaning and hygiene all day long. A lot of money was spent, which affected production, and the masses complained a lot. As soon as the cadres left, the health campaign passed like a gust of wind again. The masses felt that engaging in hygiene was both a waste of money and time, and very troublesome. They believed that their fate was "ordained by heaven" and that diseases and epidemics were "destined" and inauspicious, always hoping that "Guan Yin Bodhisattva" could eliminate disasters and diseases. This shows that launching health campaigns in rural areas is by no means an easy task that can be accomplished with just a few words. There are ideological and habitual obstacles in the way. Without taking the correct measures and overcoming these obstacles, health campaigns can never be launched.

Accounting, Complaining, Digging Out the Roots

The two campaigns had failed, but a few young activists in the village did not lose heart. Encouraged and helped by the district committee, they launched a third health campaign in early 1953. Based on the lessons learned from the previous two failures, they emphasized that the purpose of this health campaign was for good health and to improve production. In terms of method, they started by mobilizing the masses at all levels and resolving their ideological obstacles. After countless connections and conversations, they finally united a group of young people and women activists, mobilized these people to take the lead in improving their own families' and personal hygiene, and set an example. At the same time, they conducted in-depth publicity and education among the students of the village's primary school, first getting their minds in order. Thus, a propaganda team including young people, women, primary school students, and primary school teachers was organized and went deep into each household to carry out work. The method of propaganda was to recall the pain of diseases, calculate the losses of death caused by diseases, and explain why so many people had died in the past and why life had been so hard. Epidemics, deaths, and poverty were too terrible for the masses here. As long as they did the math and complained, the roots would be dug out, and the majority of the masses would see that it was indeed a good thing to launch health campaigns, and it would not cost much. As a result, more and more people participated in the health campaign. On the basis of the gradual improvement of the masses' awareness, some simple and easy-to-implement hygiene work was gradually carried out, such as cleaning up the living environment and separating humans and livestock. Once the health campaign was launched, it indeed gave people a new impression, and more people felt that paying attention to hygiene was of great benefit. In addition, activists played a demonstrative role in personal hygiene (such as brushing teeth, using serving chopsticks, and spitting into spittoons), and a comprehensive health campaign slowly spread. Especially after the promulgation of the "National Agricultural Development Program" (Draft) in 1955, when the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao called for the elimination of the "four pests," there was a clearer goal for carrying out health campaigns, and the masses' confidence was further enhanced. Over the past five years, the Qile Cooperative's health campaign has been consistently carried out, the various systems of hygiene work have been improved day by day, and attention to hygiene has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and has become a conscious habit of the masses.

Infectious Diseases and Garbage Disappear Together

Today's Qile Cooperative is showing a new atmosphere of cleanliness and order everywhere. Upon entering the villages here, one feels refreshed and happy. No matter which corner of the village one walks to, one cannot see garbage. The weeds in front of and behind the houses have been removed, and no dirt or foul water can be found in the gutters. Mosquitoes and flies have also been basically eliminated. According to the inspection this summer, an average of only two flies and one mosquito were found per hundred square meters. When farmers cool off in the threshing floor, they no longer need fans to drive away mosquitoes, and the mosquito nets in the cooperative have been stored in the bottom of the cabinets. The infectious diseases that used to be prevalent have also disappeared. Dysentery, which used to occur twice a year, has not affected a single person since 1954. Malaria has not occurred since 1955. The population, which had been declining year by year in the past, stopped declining from 1954. In 1955, the net increase was nine people. In 1956, the net increase was sixteen people. In the first half of this year, the net increase was thirteen people. Now the total population of the cooperative has increased from 529 in 1954 to 567. In mountainous areas with an extreme shortage of labor, the increase in population is of great benefit to promoting mountainous construction.

"Guan Yin Was Washed Away Long Ago"

Carrying out health campaigns also brought a magical power, that is, eliminating the superstition of the peasants for thousands of years. The masses of the Qile Cooperative have completely understood that "Guan Yin" is a liar, and that only the "god of hygiene" is the most effective. An old woman in her seventies also threw the Guan Yin Bodhisattva, whom she had personally worshiped for a lifetime, into the river. When a comrade went to visit, he deliberately asked her, "Didn't you worship Guan Yin Bodhisattva in the past? Where is that Bodhisattva now?" She answered very simply, "She was washed away by the flood long ago." Originally, there were two witches in this village, but because no one looked for them anymore, they had to turn over a new leaf and participate in agricultural production.

Everyone Pays Attention to Hygiene, Every Family Loves Cleanliness

In carrying out health campaigns, the Qile Cooperative not only focused on environmental public health, but also paid special attention to personal and family hygiene.

In terms of environmental public health, they stipulated the necessary and practical systems and did the following work: (1) Establish a hygiene rotation system with the production team or natural village as the unit. Set up a duty sign. When the sign is hung at the door of a household, that household is responsible for cleaning the courtyard and inspecting the hygiene of each household. Each household uses the time to cook breakfast in the morning to carry out a cleaning. (2) Carry out a health-related fertilizer accumulation campaign once every ten days. The entire cooperative carries out a general cleaning, including weeding, cleaning ditches, disinfecting drinking water, and transporting manure. (3) All wells and toilets must be covered. They also built a new "demonstration" toilet that is flushed with water after use. (4) Implement the separation of humans and livestock. Pigsties and cowsheds were built outside the houses. Not only were the pigs raised collectively by the cooperative like this, but the pigs raised by families were also raised in a pigsty shared by several families, which fundamentally changed the past phenomenon of humans and livestock living together.

In terms of family hygiene, each family has a spittoon (some use earthen jars), and everyone has developed the habit of spitting into the spittoon. All kinds of utensils in the family are placed neatly and wiped very clean. Personal hygiene has generally achieved the following points: (1) Everyone has their own washcloth and bath towel (some are towels, some are made of cloth), and everyone has a toothbrush. Whether adults or children, they have all developed the habit of brushing their teeth in the morning and evening; (2) Use serving chopsticks when eating, and wash the bowls and chopsticks with boiling water once a day. Leftover food is placed in cabinets or covered with something; (3) Everyone takes a bath and changes clothes regularly, and all bedding is washed and sun-dried frequently; (4) The past habit of drinking cold water and raw water has been fundamentally changed, and now everyone drinks boiled water.

In rural areas, it is certainly not so easy to launch health campaigns, but it is even more difficult to maintain and consolidate them. The Qile Cooperative has been carrying out health campaigns for five years, and it has been getting better every year. What is the reason for this? The most important thing is that they pay attention to conducting ideological education and health knowledge education among the masses on a regular basis, so that everyone understands the benefits of paying attention to hygiene and also knows how to pay attention to hygiene, and truly develops good habits of everyone paying attention to hygiene and every family loving cleanliness. If you go to the Qile Cooperative, even a three- or five-year-old child can tell you a set of hygienic principles such as "Brushing teeth is to keep the mouth and teeth clean" and "Using serving chopsticks is to avoid spreading germs." To make the masses willing to do hygiene work and consciously develop the habit of paying attention to hygiene is not easy at first, but as long as everyone has a certain understanding of hygiene, it will not be difficult to implement various hygiene systems. Now the masses of the Qile Cooperative have completely developed good habits of paying attention to hygiene. When a general cleaning is launched, men, women, and children all work together. No one is lazy, and everyone helps and supervises each other. Those who do well and those who do badly will be praised or criticized. Now the masses of the Qile Cooperative have "three fears": First, they are afraid that visitors will not abide by their hygiene rules; second, they are afraid that the masses will go out for something, or that cadres will go to the county or district for meetings, and contract infectious diseases and bring them back; and third, the daughters-in-law are afraid of returning to their parents' homes. A daughter-in-law who had just married from another village went to her parents' home for the New Year. She originally planned to stay for six or seven days, but as soon as she went back, she complained that her parents' home was dirty, "not in line with the hygiene system," and felt that she could not get used to it, so she ran back the next day.

The leaders of the Qile Cooperative pay close attention to the health campaign. The production plan also includes a hygiene work item. When arranging work, they always include hygiene work as well. Under the leadership of the Party branch and the cooperative committee, the cooperative has specially established a health work committee to guide, inspect, and supervise the health campaign. They also run a fairly large health station, and invited a Chinese medicine practitioner to be responsible for mobile treatment and technical guidance for the health campaign. The health station has both Chinese and Western medicines. Each visit costs two jiao, and the medicine is charged at cost. The funds for the health station are supplemented by the cooperative's public welfare fund in addition to the charges for seeing patients. After the establishment of the health station, it was very popular among the masses, and they no longer had to run to the small town more than 20 miles away to see a doctor.

"A Thousandfold Profit"

Will launching health campaigns hinder production? This is an important issue of concern to people. The experience of the Qile Cooperative proves that not only will it not hinder production, but on the contrary, it will effectively promote the development of production. This is because: First, because hygiene has been improved, diseases and deaths have been reduced, the labor force engaged in production has been greatly increased, and the health of the masses has been guaranteed. The enthusiasm for production has been greatly increased, and the attendance rate and labor efficiency have been significantly improved. In the past two years since the establishment of the Qile Cooperative, the attendance rate of the members has remained above 98%, and absenteeism due to illness has been extremely rare. Second, ordinary hygiene work does not use the main labor force and does not take up labor time. It is undertaken by auxiliary labor who stay at home to cook and take care of children, so it will not hinder production. As for the general cleaning, it is only three times a month. Although a few main labor forces have to participate (such as carrying manure), this is done in conjunction with the fertilizer accumulation campaign, and it cannot be said to be "delaying" production. Therefore, the Qile Cooperative not only improved hygiene, but also did a good job in production. There are facts that can prove this: First, the amount of fertilizer has increased. In 1954, 3.7 million catties of fertilizer were accumulated. In 1955, it increased to 5.48 million catties. In 1956, it increased to 8.67 million catties, averaging more than 10,000 catties of fertilizer per mu. There are many ways to open up fertilizer sources, and cleaning cowsheds and pigsties in combination with health campaigns, and eliminating dirt from ditches, are important measures to increase fertilizer. Furthermore, grain production has increased significantly. In 1955, it increased by 45.5% compared to 1954, and in 1956, it increased by 50% compared to 1955. There are certainly many reasons for the increase in grain production, and more fertilizer and a strong labor force are important factors.

Does carrying out health campaigns cost a lot of money? The experience of the Qile Cooperative proves that the masses only spend very little money, and the state does not have to spend any money at all. And the money spent by the masses, because they have improved hygiene and also improved production, has greatly increased their income. Compared to this, it is insignificant. In 1954, the average income per household in the Qile Cooperative was 396.9 yuan, which increased to 418.3 yuan in 1955, exceeding the level of ordinary middle peasants. Last year, it even reached 468.7 yuan. Now the members eat dry rice three times a day, and one-third of the households in the cooperative have built new houses. After the health campaign was launched, the peasants only bought a few more toothbrushes, a few towels, and one or two spittoons and earthen jars a year. The cost was not much, and they got peace of mind, eliminated diseases, increased production and income, and improved their lives. The masses call it "a thousandfold profit," which is the best thing.

With the Determination of "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountain," Sparrows and Rats Can Be Eliminated

Of course, there are still many areas in the Qile Cooperative that need to be improved in carrying out health campaigns. For example, mosquitoes and flies have not been completely eliminated, and the other "two pests" of the "four pests" - sparrows and rats - are even farther from being completely eliminated. The Qile Cooperative is located in a mountainous area, and it may take longer to eliminate sparrows and rats, but as long as they can persevere and have the determination and vigor of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountain, they can eventually achieve their goal.

The experience of the Qile Cooperative in carrying out the patriotic health campaign tells us that as long as we adhere to the mass line, rely on the masses, the methods are practical and feasible, and can be closely integrated with production, the rural health campaign can certainly be launched and can be sustained. Now the Qile Cooperative has become a banner for carrying out health campaigns in the Shaoguan Special District and Guangdong Province. We have decided to comprehensively promote the experience of the Qile Cooperative. The specific requirements are:

(1) In each county of the entire special district, select one or several agricultural cooperatives as pilot projects for carrying out patriotic health campaigns, and strive to achieve the same results as the Qile Cooperative within three years, that is, before 1960; (2) Select Lechang County as the key county for carrying out patriotic health campaigns, and strive to basically eliminate the four pests during the second five-year plan period and universally carry out health campaigns in all agricultural cooperatives; (3) In the entire special district, it is required to eliminate the "four pests" and comprehensively carry out health campaigns within ten years. If the Qile Cooperative can do it, why can't other places do it? We believe that it can definitely be done.

    家家户户讲卫生　五年坚持如一日
    岐乐社消灭蚊蝇推进生产
    在农村中能否在一定时期内基本消灭“四害”？群众的爱国增产卫生运动能否开展起来和坚持下去？也就是说，全国农业发展纲要（草案）中所规定的第二十七条奋斗目标能不能实现？根据广东省乐易县岐乐农林生产合作社的事实证明，可以肯定是能够实现的。
    “发人瘟的绝地方”
    岐乐社在山区，森林资源很丰富。但在国民党统治时代，痢疾、疟疾等疫病年年流行，人口死亡率很高，农民过着极端贫困的生活。1937年，这里本来有六百多人，到1949年解放时，只剩下五百一十一人了。农民邒盛才一家五口，有一年因患痢疾四天之内死去三人。农民邒水奇一家四人，也因患痢疾死去兄弟二人，剩下他和他的母亲，也患了恶性疟疾，长年不能劳动。最严重的是有四十多户人的唐家洞，在1947年秋天一场痢疾死去小孩二十四个。当时的岐乐村，被人称为“发人瘟”的“绝地方”，在外村流行着“有女不嫁岐乐村”的话。在这种病魔恐怖气氛下，农民就靠着“观世音”和“神仙水”来维系命运，但“观世音”并没有显灵，瘟疫照样可怕地流行着。
    两次发动，两次失败
    解放后，党和政府就在这里发动了卫生运动。1952年2月间，为了反对美帝国主义进行细菌战，区委会打算先在这里搞起防疫卫生运动，但只是在群众中作了一些空泛的宣传，广大群众发动不起来，谁也不愿干。同年8月，区委会又派人来，要群众停下生产，整天搞清洁卫生，花了不少钱，影响了生产，群众怨言很多，干部一走，卫生运动又像一阵风过去了。群众觉得搞卫生既浪费钱财，耽搁时间，又很麻烦。他们认为命是“天定”的，病疫是“天数”不吉利，总希望“观世音菩萨”能消灾去病。这说明了在农村开展卫生运动绝不是一讲就成的事，当中有着思想上和习惯上的重重阻力，不采取正确措施，不克服这些阻力，卫生运动绝不能开展起来。
    算账，诉苦，挖出了根子
    两次运动都失败了，但是这个村的几个青年积极分子并没有灰心失望，他们在区委会的鼓励和帮助下，于1953年初又开展第三次卫生运动。他们根据上两次失败的教训，强调地提出这次卫生运动的目的是为着身体健康与搞好生产。在方法上，首先从层层发动群众，解决群众的思想阻力着手。经过无数次的串连与交谈，好容易团结了一批青年和妇女中的积极分子，发动这些人带头，把自己的家庭和个人卫生搞好，作出榜样；同时，又在这个村的小学学生中深入进行宣传教育，先搞通了他们的思想。于是，一个包括青年、妇女、小学生、小学教师的宣传队伍组织起来了，深入到各家各户进行工作。宣传的办法是回忆疾病的痛苦，算疾病带来的死亡损失的账，说明为什么过去死这样多的人，为什么生活这样苦。疫瘟、死亡、贫困对这里的群众是太可怕了，只要一算账，一诉苦，根子就挖出来了，大多数群众也就看清了把卫生运动搞起来确是一件好事，并不花费什么。于是，参加卫生运动的人越来越多。在群众觉悟渐渐提高的基础上，逐步地做了一些简单易行的卫生工作，比如打扫居住环境，实行人畜分居，等等。卫生运动一经发动起来，确实给人一新观感，更多的人感到讲卫生大有好处，加上积极分子从个人卫生上（如刷牙、吃饭用公筷、吐痰入盂等）起了示范作用，全面的卫生运动慢慢铺开。特别是1955年“全国农业发展纲要”（草案）公布，党中央和毛主席号召消灭“四害”以后，开展卫生运动有了更明确的目标，群众的信心更加增强了。五年来，岐乐社的卫生运动一直坚持着，卫生工作的各项制度一天天健全起来，讲究卫生已深入人心，成为群众的自觉的习惯。
    传染病和垃圾一起绝迹
    现在的岐乐社，到处都显现着一片清洁、整齐的新气象。一进到这里的村庄，就令人有清新愉快的感觉，无论走到村子的那个角落，看不到垃圾，屋前屋后的杂草都已铲除，阴沟里也找不到污物臭水，苍蝇、蚊子也基本消灭了。根据今年夏季的检查，平均每一百方公尺的地方，只发现了两只苍蝇和一只蚊子。农民在禾坪里乘凉，再也用不着扇子来赶蚊子了，社里的蚊帐也收藏到柜子的底层。过去流行的传染病也绝迹了。原来每年两次的痢疾，从1954年至今没有一个患的。疟疾从1955年以来也没有发生过。过去年年下降的人口，从1954年起即停止下降，到1955年净增了九人，1956年净增了十六人，今年上半年净增了十三人。现在全社已由1954年的五百二十九人增加到五百六十七人。在劳动力极端缺乏的山区，人口的增加对促进山区建设有莫大好处。
    “观世音早给大水冲走了”
    开展卫生运动还带来一股神奇的力量，那就是把千百年来农民的迷信破除了。岐乐社的群众已完全明白了“观世音”是骗人的，只有“卫生之神”最为灵验。一个七十多岁的老太婆也把亲自供奉一辈子的观世音菩萨丢到河里去了。有个同志去参观故意问她：“你老人家过去不是拜观音菩萨的吗？现在那尊菩萨到那里去了？”她很干脆地回答说：“早给大水冲走了。”原来这村里有两个巫婆，也因没有人再找他们，只好改邪归正，参加了农业生产。
    人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁
    岐乐社在开展卫生运动中，一方面抓紧了环境公共卫生，同时也特别重视个人家庭卫生。
    在环境公共卫生方面，他们规定了必需的切实可行的制度，做了以下一些工作：（1）以生产队或自然村为单位，建立卫生轮值制度，设一个值日牌，牌子挂到那家门口，就由那家负责打扫庭院，并且负责检查各户的卫生。各户都利用早上烧饭的时间，进行一次扫除。（2）每十天开展卫生积肥运动一次，全社进行大扫除，包括铲草，清理水沟，饮水消毒，运出大便等工作。（3）所有水井、厕所一律加盖。他们还新建了一个便后用水冲洗的“示范”厕所。（4）实行人畜分居，在屋外另外盖了猪舍、牛栏。不仅是社内集体养的猪是这样，家庭养的猪也是几家合用一间猪舍喂养，已根本改变了过去人畜住在一起的现象。
    在家庭卫生方面，每家都设有痰盂（有的用瓦罐），每个人都养成了吐痰入盂的习惯，家庭中的各种用具都放得整整齐齐，擦拭得十分干净。个人卫生一般都做到了以下几点：（1）每个人都有自己的洗面巾和洗澡巾（有的是毛巾，有的是布做的），每个人都有一把牙刷，无论大人、小孩，都养成了早晚刷牙的习惯；（2）吃饭用公筷，碗筷每天用开水烫洗一次，剩饭剩菜都放到柜里或用东西盖着；（3）每人都定期洗澡、换衣服，所有的被服做到了勤洗勤晒；（4）已经根本改变了过去喝冷水、生水的习惯，现在一律喝开水了。
    在农村，把卫生运动搞起来固然不是那么容易，而要把卫生运动坚持巩固下去，那就更不容易了。岐乐社开展卫生运动已有五年，一年比一年好，这是什么原因呢？最重要的一条，是他们注意经常在群众中进行思想教育和卫生常识教育，使大家懂得讲卫生的好处，也懂得怎样讲卫生，真正养成了人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁的良好习惯。你到岐乐社那怕是找一个三、五岁的小孩子，他也能把“刷牙是为了保持口腔、牙齿的清洁”、“用公筷是为了避免传染病菌”等一套卫生道理讲出来。要使群众愿意做卫生工作，自觉地养成讲卫生的习惯，开头并不容易，但只要大家对卫生有了一定的认识以后，推行各项卫生制度就不费力了。现在岐乐社的群众完全养成了讲卫生的好习惯。一发动清洁大扫除，男女老少一齐动手，没有一个人懒散，并且做到了互相帮助、互相监督。做得好的、坏的，都会受到表扬或批评。现在岐乐社的群众有“三怕”：一怕外来的客人不遵守他们的卫生规矩；二怕群众有事出门，干部到县区开会，染了传染病带回来；三是媳妇怕回娘家。有一个刚从外村娶来的媳妇，新年去娘家，原来打算住六、七天，但是一回去，便嫌娘家肮脏，“不合卫生制度”，感到过不惯，第二天就跑回来了。
    岐乐社的领导人员对卫生运动抓得很紧，生产规划里也有卫生工作一项内容，平时布置工作，总要把卫生工作也布置进去。这个社在党支部和社委会的领导下，专门建立了一个卫生工作委员会来指导和检查督促卫生运动。他们还办了一所颇具规模的卫生站，请来了一个中医师，负责巡回治疗和开展卫生运动的技术指导。卫生站有中药也有西药，看病一次收费二角，用药照价收钱，卫生站的经费除看病收费外，不足的由社的公益金补助。卫生站设立起来之后，很受群众欢迎，他们再也不必跑到二十多里外的小镇去看病了。
    “一本万利”
    搞起卫生运动之后，会不会妨碍生产呢？这是人所关心的一个重要问题。岐乐社的经验证明，不仅不会妨碍生产，恰恰相反，正是有效地推动了生产的发展。这是因为：第一，由于搞好了卫生，减少了疾病和死亡，从事生产的劳动力就大大增加了，同时群众健康有了保障，生产劲头大了，出勤率和劳动效率显著提高，岐乐社办社二年来，社员的出勤率一直保持在98％以上，因病缺勤已极为少见。第二，平常的卫生工作，都不使用主要劳动力和不占劳动时间，由在家煮饭、带孩子的附带劳动力担负起来，所以不会妨碍生产。至于大扫除，一月只有三次，虽然要少数主要劳动力参加（如挑粪），但这是和积肥运动结合着进行的，不能说是“耽搁”了生产。因此，岐乐社不仅卫生搞好了，而且生产也搞得很好。有事实可以证明：一是肥料增加了。1954年积肥三百七十万斤，1955年增加到五百四十八万斤，1956年更增加到八百六十七万斤，平均每亩有一万多斤肥。开辟肥源是多方面的，而结合卫生运动清理牛舍、猪舍，消除阴沟污物等，是增加肥料的一项重要措施。再是粮食显著增产了。1955年比1954年增产45.5％，1956年比1955年增产50％。粮食增产原因固然很多，而积肥多、劳动力强是重要的因素。
    开展卫生运动要不要耗费很多钱呢？岐乐社的经验证明：群众只费极少几个钱，国家根本不用费钱。而群众所费的钱，由于搞好了卫生，也搞好了生产，因而收入大为增加，比较起来，那是微不足道的。岐乐社在1954年平均每户收入三百九十六元九角，1955年增加到四百一十八元三角，已超过了一般中农的水平。去年更达到四百六十八元七角。现在社员一天三餐吃干饭，全社有三分之一的户盖了新房子。搞起卫生运动以后，农民一年只多买几把牙刷，几条毛巾和一、二个痰盂、瓦罐子，费钱并不多，就换来了人口平安，疾病消除，增产增收和生活改善，群众称之为“一本万利”，是再好不过的事。
    有“愚公移山”的决心，麻雀、老鼠都能消灭
    当然，岐乐社在开展卫生运动中还有许多需要努力改进的地方。比如苍蝇、蚊子还没有完全消灭，而“四害”中的其它“两害”——麻雀、老鼠离完全消灭的程度更远些。岐乐社在山区，要消灭麻雀和老鼠，可能时间要长一些，但只要能坚持下去，有愚公移山那样的决心和劲头，最后终可以达到目的。
    岐乐社开展爱国卫生运动的经验告诉我们，只要坚持群众路线，依靠群众，办法切实可行，与生产能紧密结合，农村卫生运动一定可以开展起来，并且能坚持下去。现在岐乐社已成为韶关专区和广东省开展卫生运动的一面旗帜，我们已决定把岐乐社的经验全面推广。具体要求是：
    （1）在全专区每个县都选择一个或数个农业社作为开展爱国卫生运动的试点，争取在三年内即到1960年以前做到像岐乐社那样的成绩；（2）选择乐昌县作为开展爱国卫生运动的重点县，求得在第二个五年计划期间基本上消灭四害，把各农业社的卫生运动普遍开展起来；（3）在全专区，要求在十年内消灭“四害”和把卫生运动全面开展起来。岐乐社能够做到的事情，为什么别的地方不能做到呢？我们认为一定是能够做到的。
