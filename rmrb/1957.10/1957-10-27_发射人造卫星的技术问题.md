Technical Problems in Launching Artificial Satellites
Guo Yonghuai, Researcher, Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

The successful launch of an artificial satellite by the Soviet Union on October 4th is of epoch-making significance in the history of human transportation. This is the first major event in the atomic age. It proves that humanity's conquest of space and the realization of interstellar travel are no longer just ideals but foreseeable facts. In humanity's journey to explore the secrets of nature, artificial satellites are like bright lights in the darkness. In the future, in various scientific fields such as high altitude, meteorology, earth science, astronomy, physics, and so on, the expansion of human knowledge is inevitable. On the other hand, with artificial satellites, the cause of world peace will be further guaranteed. This will have an immeasurable contribution to the development of culture for all mankind. Here, I would like to talk about the technical problems related to launching this satellite.

The biggest obstacle for mankind's journey into high altitude is the Earth's gravity. For example, when people throw a ball into the sky, it returns to the ground after reaching a certain height; the greater the throwing speed, the higher it rises. The relationship between launch speed and height is a fundamental law of nature. To determine whether an ascending object can be launched without returning, we must see if the launch speed can allow the object to fly beyond the Earth's gravitational range. This speed is called the "escape" velocity. In simple cases, this number is approximately 11.2 kilometers per second. To break through the constraints of the Earth's gravity and achieve interstellar travel, this speed is the goal that the propulsion engine must achieve.

The artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union this time weighed approximately 83 kilograms and orbited the Earth at a speed of 8 kilometers per second in an elliptical orbit more than 900 kilometers above the Earth. From the launch to the final entry into orbit, there are many technical problems. Now, I will briefly present the following two points.

First, rocket technology. Among various modern propulsion engines, rockets have two characteristics. They have the ability to supply a large amount of energy in a very short time, and they can burn without external oxygen, flying out of the atmosphere into a vacuum. Due to these two characteristics, rockets have become the only hope for mankind to achieve interstellar travel. The magnitude of rocket energy is directly related to its exhaust velocity. The greater the exhaust velocity, the greater the thrust or the speed achieved by the rocket. However, the exhaust velocity depends on the fuel, so improving the fuel and increasing the rocket's energy is essential. Based on the currently known chemical fuels, a simple calculation can prove that a single-stage rocket cannot reach a high speed of 11 kilometers per second.

For this reason, some people advocate the use of multi-stage rockets. A multi-stage rocket is divided into several sections, each equipped with propulsion equipment. The advantage of doing this is obvious: after a section has finished burning and lost its performance, it can be detached, making the remaining rocket lighter and easier to propel. The Soviet Union used a three-stage rocket this time. To understand the difficulty of this work, we can consider an example. Suppose an artificial satellite weighs 100 kilograms and orbits the Earth 800 kilometers above the Earth, and the fuel used is a mixture of oxygen and hydrazine. Under this condition, a possible weight distribution for a three-stage rocket is: the first stage is 91 tons, the second stage is 15.6 tons, and the third stage is 1.7 tons. The total initial weight of the rocket is 109 tons. That is to say, the weight that finally reaches the orbit accounts for only one sixty-fourth of the total weight, and the weight of the satellite is only one-seventeenth of the weight of the last stage rocket.

The thrust required to launch this rocket is 181 tons. If five engines are installed, each engine must have a thrust of 36 tons. After the first stage is detached, the thrust required for the second stage is 31 tons. Therefore, the engine required here must be much more powerful than the famous "V-2" rocket engine. If the fuel is similar, the performance of the engine used by the Soviet Union this time should also be in this range, and may of course be even better. The Soviet Union has made great progress in fuel research in recent years, using new and more powerful combustion agents. With the same thrust, the weight finally sent into orbit can be greatly increased.

Second, the problem of artificial satellite launch. The rocket launch into orbit is divided into three stages. The first stage reaches a certain height, combustion terminates, and then it automatically detaches. This section of the rocket flies in the densest layer of the atmosphere. To avoid excessive external temperature, the speed cannot be too high. The numbers chosen in the design will depend on the rocket's surface heat resistance. The second stage flies in a thinner layer of air, so the flight speed can be increased. To reach the predetermined orbit, the flight must follow a certain trajectory, and the combustion time and rocket detachment must be controlled. Due to the high speed of the third stage, it initially flies like a cannonball on a certain trajectory. After entering the satellite's orbit, the final engine is activated to accelerate the rocket to the desired speed, and the satellite is launched from the rocket.

Completing such a flight obviously has various possibilities. Depending on the rocket's performance and the selected orbit, the most suitable conditions can be found. With these conditions, an accurate automatic control system can be designed to guide the rocket's movement in each stage.

From the above two points, the success of the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial satellite not only proves that the Soviet Union has become the most industrially developed country in the world in terms of aviation and automatic control technology, but also proves that the Soviet Union has reached the highest international level in many important technical sectors.

The success of artificial satellites also proves another thing, that the era of interstellar travel has arrived. The first hurdle of interstellar travel is to establish a space navigation departure station orbiting the Earth. With the technology to launch satellites, the equipment needed to build this station can be transported to the predetermined orbit in batches and then installed. Once this station is built, the route from Earth to the Moon can be opened up first. At that time, its impact on human activities and culture will be unimaginable.

We cannot help but ask: why did this earth-shattering creation not happen in capitalist countries first, but in socialist countries? Is this not another powerful proof that only under the superior system of socialism can science, like all other undertakings, develop rapidly? The series of great achievements of Soviet scientists in recent years are inseparable from the socialist system and the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party. We Chinese people, especially scientific workers, should deeply recognize this point while celebrating the success of our Soviet brother scientists.

    发射人造卫星的技术问题
    中国科学院力学研究所研究员　郭永怀
    10月4日苏联发射人造卫星的成功，在人类交通史上具有划时代的意义。这是人类进入原子时代以后的第一件大事。它证明人类征服空间、实现星际旅行，已不再是一个理想而是可以预见的事实了。在人类向大自然探索秘密的路上，有了人造卫星就像在黑暗中得到一盏明灯。今后在各个科学领域，如高空、气象、地球、天文、物理等等，人类知识范围的扩大是必然的。另一方面，有了人造卫星，世界和平的事业就更有了保障。这对全人类文化的发展将有难以估计的贡献。这里我想谈谈关于发射这颗卫星的技术问题。
    人类向高空迈步的最大的障碍是地心的引力。譬如说，人们把一个球往天上抛，当达到一定的高度，它便又回到地面；抛的速度大些，它上升的就高些。发射速度和高度的关系是一个基本的自然定律。在决定上升物体是否可以一去不返，我们就要看发射速度是否可以使物体飞到地心引力的范围以外。这个速度叫做“脱离”速度。在简单情形下，这个数字每秒大约是十一点二公里。要突破地心引力的束缚，实现星际旅行，这个速度便是推进机须要达到的目标。
    苏联这次发射的人造卫星，重约八十三公斤，在地球九百公里以外的上空按椭圆轨道以每秒八公里的速度运行。从发射到最后进入轨道的过程中，技术问题很多，现在简单地提出以下两点。
    第一，火箭技术。在近代各种推进机中，火箭具有两个特点。它有在很短时间内供给大量的能量的性能，同时它又可以不要外界的氧气就能进行燃烧，越出空气层进到真空里飞行。由于这两个特点，火箭便成为人们实现星际旅行的唯一的希望。火箭能量的大小同它的排气速度有直接关系，排气速度大，所给的推力或火箭达到的飞速也就大。但是排气速度决定于燃料，所以改善燃料，加大火箭的能量是主要的。就目前已知的化学燃料，一个很简单的计算便可以证明，一级火箭不可能达到每秒十一公里的高速。
    为了这个缘故，有人主张采用多级火箭。多级火箭是把火箭分作几节，各节都安装推进设备。这样做的优点是很明显的，在一节燃烧完毕，失去性能之后即行脱落，剩下的火箭就轻便，容易推进。苏联这次所用的是三级火箭。为了具体了解这项工作的艰巨，我们可以考虑一个例子。假设人造卫星重一百公斤，在地球八百公里外绕地球环行，并且所用的燃料是氧和肼的混合。在这个条件下的三级火箭，一个可能的重量分布是：第一级九十一吨，第二级十五点六吨，第三级一点七吨。火箭的起始总重量结果是一百零九吨。这就是说，最后达到轨道上去的重量占总重的六十四分之一，而卫星的重量又仅仅是最后一节火箭的十七分之一。
    发射这个火箭，起始所需的推力是一百八十一吨，装设五台发动机，每台的推力就要达到三十六吨。待第一级脱落后，第二级所需的推力也要三十一吨。因此，这里所要的发动机，就要比著名的“V—2”火箭的发动机强大得多，如果燃料类似，苏联这次所用的发动机的性能，应当也在这个范围，当然也可能比这个还要好。苏联近年来在燃料的研究方面有很大的进步，利用到新的更有力的燃烧剂，同样大的推力，最后送到轨道上的重量，还可以大大增加。
    第二，人造卫星发射的问题。火箭的发出到进入轨道，共分为三个阶段。第一级在达到一定的高度，燃烧终止而后自动脱落。这一段火箭是在大气密度最浓的一层里飞行，为了避免外体的温度过高，速度不能太大，在设计上所选择的数字，要取决于火箭表面抗热的能力。第二级是在空气较淡的一层里飞行，飞行速度因之就可以加高。为了达到预定轨道，飞行就要遵循一定的轨迹，燃烧的时间和火箭的脱体都是要控制的。第三级由于速度高的关系，开始时就像炮弹一样地在一定的轨道上飞，待进入卫星的轨道后，最后的发动机才开动，把火箭加速到所要达到的速度，同时卫星便从火箭射出来。
    完成这样的飞行，显然是有各种可能性的。根据火箭的性能和选定的轨道，最适宜的条件是可以找到的。有了这个条件，便可以设计一个准确的自动控制系统，指导火箭在每个阶段的运动。
    从以上两点看来，苏联发射人造卫星的成功，不仅证明了苏联在航空和自动控制的技术上已经成为世界上工业最发达的国家，而且也证明了苏联在许多重要的技术部门已经达到国际最高的水平。
    人造卫星的成功还证明了另外一件事，就是星际旅行的时代已经来临。星际旅行的第一道关口，便是建立一个环绕地球运行的空间航行的出发站。有了发射卫星的技术，就可以把建立这个站所需的器材分批运送到预定的轨道上去，然后再安装起来。这个站一旦建成，地球到月球的航路首先就可以开辟。那时候，它对人类的活动和文化所起的作用，将是不可想像的。
    我们不禁要问：为什么这件惊天动地的创举，不先发生在资本主义国家而发生在社会主义国家？这岂不是又一个有力的证明，只有在社会主义的优越制度下的科学，正如其他各种事业一样，才能迅速发展。苏联科学家近几年来一系列的巨大成就，是和社会主义制度、苏联共产党的领导分不开的。我们中国人民，尤其是科学工作者，在庆祝苏联兄弟科学家们的成功的同时，应当深刻地认识到这一点。
