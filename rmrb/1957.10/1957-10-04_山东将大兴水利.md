Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 2nd — Shandong Province will witness a high tide of agricultural capital construction centered on water conservancy projects this winter and next spring. This issue was discussed in detail at the Shandong Farmland Water Conservancy Conference, which closed on the 28th of last month.

The conference determined that Shandong's guiding principle for water conservancy construction is to simultaneously develop irrigation, drainage, and flood prevention, and to vigorously carry out soil and water conservation in mountainous areas and transformation of low-lying areas. The tasks for water conservancy construction in 1958 are to expand the irrigated area by 5 million mu, and improve 5 million mu; to build drainage and low-lying area transformation projects for 3 million mu, and improve 4 million mu; and to complete soil and water conservation control over an area of 6,000 square kilometers in mountainous regions. It is required that more than 80% of these tasks be completed this winter and next spring.

    山东将大兴水利
    新华社济南2日电  山东省在今冬明春将出现一个以兴修水利为中心的农业基本建设高潮。在上月28日闭幕的山东农田水利会议上，对这个问题进行了详细的讨论。
    会议确定山东兴修水利的方针是发展灌溉与除涝、防洪并重，大力开展山区水土保持与洼地改造工作。1958年兴修水利的任务是发展灌溉面积五百万亩，改善五百万亩；兴建除涝与洼地改造工程三百万亩，改善四百万亩；完成山区水土保持控制面积六千平方公里。这些任务要求在今冬明春完成80％以上。
