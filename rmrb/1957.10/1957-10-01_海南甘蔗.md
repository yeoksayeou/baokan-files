    Hainan Sugarcane
    Sugarcane production in Hainan Island has exceeded the targets set by the First Five-Year Plan. The total output will reach 884,610,000 catties, more than four times the level of 1937, the most developed year for sugarcane production before liberation.

    Over the past eight years, thanks to the active promotion of superior varieties and a series of technological reforms by governments at all levels, the yield per unit area has generally increased by 60% compared to pre-liberation times. The Ren San Agricultural Cooperative in Qiongshan, which mainly produces sugarcane, also achieved the high-yield plan of a "ten-thousand-catty cooperative" last year, with the highest yield per mu reaching over 23,000 catties.

    With the development of sugarcane production, Hainan's sugar refining industry is also developing accordingly. Before liberation, there were only three small sugar mills on the entire island with a total daily crushing capacity of no more than 200 tons. In the past two years, six newly built and expanded mechanized sugar mills have been established, with a total daily crushing capacity of over 1,100 tons. The local government plans to further expand the planting area by 150,000 mu next year and build five more new-type sugar mills.

    海南甘蔗
    海南岛的甘蔗生产已超过第一个五年计划指标。总产量将达到八亿八千四百六十一万斤，比解放前生产最发达的1937年增长了四倍多。
    八年来，由于各级政府积极推广优良品种和一系列的技术改革，单位面积产量普遍比解放前提高六成。以生产甘蔗为主的琼山仁三农业社，去年还实现了万斤社的丰产计划，亩产最高达二万三千多斤。
    随着甘蔗生产的发展，海南的制糖工业也在相应地发展。解放前，全岛只有三个日榨量总和不超过二百吨的小型糖厂。而最近两年新建和扩建的机械化糖厂就有六个，日榨量总和达到一千一百多吨。当地政府计划明年再扩大十五万亩的种植面积，并再建五个新型糖厂。
