Poetry from the Countryside

    So He Was a Big Grain Merchant All Along
    Zhang Xiangtao
    The well-to-do middle peasant Li Jixiang,
    Has a foot-and-a-half long pipe in his hand,
    He squints his eyes and takes a puff,
    And evil schemes begin to expand.
    He’s not satisfied with the unified purchase and sale,
    Shouting about grain shortages on every street and land.
    His desire to get rich never dies,
    Seems like he's gone mad with a wealth-getting stand,
    He seeks out the cadres three times a day,
    Wiping his eyes and faking a crying demand:
    “My family had nothing to cook this morning,
    The pillows and blankets are all gone, consumed by famished band.”
    When the countryside began the Great Blooming and Letting Go,
    Jixiang’s tricks are brought into the light's glow,
    The masses come to expose him,
    So he was a big grain merchant all along, as we now know.
                   1957.9．Tangshan

    原来他是大粮商
    张响涛
    富裕中农李吉祥，
    旱烟袋儿尺半长，
    眯上眼睛抽一袋，
    肚里生出坏主张。
    统购统销他不满，
    大街小巷喊缺粮。
    发财心儿总不死，
    好像得了发财狂，
    一天三次找干部，
    擦眼抹泪装哭相：
    “我家早上没揭锅
    枕头被子全吃光。”
    农村开始大鸣放，
    吉祥把戏露真相，
    群众纷纷来检举，
    原来他是大粮商。
                   1957.9．唐山
