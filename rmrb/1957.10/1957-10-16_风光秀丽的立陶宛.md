Scenic Lithuania

Lithuania is one of the three Soviet republics on the Baltic coast. It is a country with beautiful scenery and a mild climate. After the Great October Revolution, like Russia, it also established a Soviet regime. However, the imperialists of the Entente went to suppress it, helping the Lithuanian bourgeoisie restore their rule. The vicious reactionaries, with the support of the imperialists, ruled Lithuania for twenty years. At that time, Lithuanian banks were in the hands of the Germans, the electrical industry was controlled by the Belgians, and the match factory was the property of the Swedish Match King. The imperialists tried their best to lower the prices of agricultural products; sometimes a kilogram of grain could not be exchanged for two boxes of matches. The working people lived a miserable and desolate life. It was not until 1940 that the people overthrew the reactionary rule, re-established the Soviet regime, and joined the Soviet family. Since then, the light of a new life has shone on the land of Lithuania.

On the quiet banks of the Neman River, Lithuania's brave young generation has grown up. They are advancing in step with their brothers in other republics. New red chimneys are reaching towards the blue sky one after another. Where the sound of motors was never heard before, the sound of sirens now awakens people every morning. Lithuania has built hundreds of factories, and its total industrial output has increased fivefold compared to 1940. The food industry accounts for 40% of the total industrial output. Its electricity production will reach more than one billion kilowatt-hours by 1960, while under bourgeois rule, its electricity production ranked last in Europe. In addition, Lithuanian-branded lathes and engines can be seen not only in Soviet cities, but are also exported to Poland, Romania, and distant India. Lithuania can now produce fishing trawlers, ships, steam turbines, diesel engines, various agricultural machines, peat excavating combines, and so on.

On Lithuania's vast grasslands with rolling hills, there are many pastures, and forage crops also occupy a large area of arable land. Therefore, Lithuania's animal husbandry is very developed, especially pig farming and milk production. Milk production per capita has long exceeded that of the United States.

In terms of area, population, and population density, Lithuania surpasses Latvia and Estonia, ranking first among the three Baltic republics, with a population of 2.7 million. Its capital, Vilnius, is an ancient city with rich revolutionary traditions. The great Lenin visited here in 1895. The famous revolutionary and old Bolshevik, Dzerzhinsky, began his revolutionary activities in Vilnius. Vilnius University is one of the oldest universities in Europe. However, this does not mean that education was well-developed in Lithuania during the bourgeois rule. In the past, it was also a country with a high illiteracy rate, and reading was the privilege of the rich. Now, the number of primary schools is thirty-five times that of the bourgeois era, secondary schools are six times that of the bourgeois era, and there are 24,000 university students. People live a cultured and happy life.

### 风光秀丽的立陶宛

　　风光秀丽的立陶宛
    立陶宛是波罗的海沿岸苏联的三个加盟共和国之一。这是个风光秀丽、气候温和的国家。它在伟大的十月革命以后，也同俄国一样，建立了苏维埃政权。但是，协约国的帝国主义者们却赶去镇压，帮助立陶宛的资产阶级恢复了统治。凶恶的反动派在帝国主义者的支持下一直统治了立陶宛二十年。那时，立陶宛的银行握在德国人的手中，电气工业为比利时人掌管，火柴厂则是瑞典火柴大王的财产。帝国主义者尽力压低农产品的价格，有时一公斤粮食换不到两盒火柴。劳动人民过着苦难的凄凉岁月。到1940年人民才推翻了反动统治，重新建立起苏维埃政权，加入了苏联大家庭。从此，新生活的光芒照耀在立陶宛的土地上。
    在寂静的涅曼河畔，立陶宛的勇敢的年青一代生长起来了。他们同其他共和国的兄弟们齐步前进。新的红色的烟囱一个跟着一个地伸向蔚蓝色的天空。在从前听不到马达声音的地方，现在汽笛声每早唤醒人们。立陶宛已经建起了几百个工厂，工业总产量已增加为1940年的五倍。食品工业在工业总产量中占40％。它的电力生产到1960年将达十亿度以上，而在资产阶级统治时，它的电力生产居欧洲末位。此外，带有立陶宛牌号的车床和发动机，不仅在苏联城市可以看到，而且还输出到波兰、罗马尼亚和遥远的印度。捕鱼曳网船、轮船、汽轮机、柴油发动机、各种农业机器、泥炭挖掘联合机等等，立陶宛现在都能生产了。
    在立陶宛那丘陵起伏的广阔的草原上，牧场很多，饲料作物也占耕地的很大面积。因此，立陶宛的畜牧业非常发达，特别是养猪业和牛奶业。牛奶产量按人口计算早已超过了美国。
    按幅员、人口和人口密度来说，立陶宛超过了拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚，在波罗的海沿岸这三个共和国中占第一位，人口有二百七十万。它的首都维尔纽斯是一个古老的、富有革命传统的城市。伟大的列宁曾在1895年到过这里。著名的革命家、老布尔什维克捷尔任斯基就是在维尔纽斯开始革命活动的。维尔纽斯大学是欧洲历史最悠久的大学之一。然而这并不是说立陶宛在资产阶级统治时代教育事业就很发达。过去它也是个文盲极多的国家，读书是有钱人的特权。现在，小学校的数目是资产阶级统治时代的三十五倍，中等学校是资产阶级时代的六倍，大学生有二万四千人。人们过着有文化的幸福的生活。
