The Syrian pound maintains its original value. Because Syria has payment agreements with Arab countries, and the large quantity of Syrian goods exported to friendly countries including the Soviet Union and China compensate for the reduced exports due to Western countries' unwillingness to import Syrian goods.

    叙利亚经济情况正常
    据新华社大马士革24日电　叙利亚中央银行总裁特拉布尔西23日在回答叙利亚通讯社提出的关于目前时局对叙利亚经济和财政的影响这一问题时说，叙利亚的出口是正常的。叙镑仍保持原来的价值。因为叙利亚和阿拉伯国家订有支付协定，而且叙利亚向包括苏联和中国在内的友好国家出口的大量叙利亚货物弥补了由于西方国家不愿进口叙利亚货物而减少的出口。
