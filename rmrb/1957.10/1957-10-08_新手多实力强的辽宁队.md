    The Liaoning team has considerable strength. It possesses nine national athletes, including Liu Yuying, who recently won the silver medal in the women's 80-meter hurdles at the Bucharest International Athletics Competition, as well as Shi Baozhu, the national record holder for women's discus and shot put, and Yu Jin'an, a male javelin thrower.
    Among the thirty-eight athletes preparing to participate in the Group B competition, except for those in the pentathlon and decathlon, all are second-level athletes.
    There are also quite a few newcomers in this team, accounting for about 60% of the entire team.

    他们准备参加乙组比赛的三十八个运动员中，除五项运动与十项运动外，全部都是二级运动员。
