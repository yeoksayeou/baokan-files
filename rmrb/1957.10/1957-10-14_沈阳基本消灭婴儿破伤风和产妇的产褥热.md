Thanks to the rapid development of maternal and child health work in Shenyang, tetanus neonatorum, which threatened the lives of newborns, has been basically eliminated. The mortality rate of newborns has dropped from 40% before liberation to the current 1.23%.

Currently, Shenyang has 96 health stations, with one maternal and child health worker for every 629 women of childbearing age on average. In addition to expanding and renovating six old health clinics, a new type of obstetrics hospital has also been established in the city, and puerperal fever in mothers has been basically eliminated.
