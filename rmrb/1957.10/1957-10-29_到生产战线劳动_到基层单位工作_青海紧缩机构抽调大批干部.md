Xinhua News Agency, Xining, October 26th: The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after several meetings and discussions, decided to continue streamlining organizations and transfer large numbers of cadres to participate in production labor and work in grassroots units. Currently, Qinghai Province and Xining city-level organs are studying and formulating plans for streamlining organizations and decentralizing cadres. Among the provincial-level organs, the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department and Culture and Education Department, the Construction Commission and the Planning Commission, and the Commerce Department and the Service Department have been determined to merge. The finance and trade system has already merged and abolished seventy units in the first half of this year and is now preparing to merge and abolish another thirty units. Xining City has also decided to merge and abolish sixteen units, and abolish six companies including department stores, monopolies, vegetables, textiles, coal construction, and oils and fats, with the businesses transferred to the Commerce Bureau and the Grain Bureau respectively.

While streamlining organizations, the provincial, autonomous prefectural, and county-level organs are expected to transfer over ten thousand cadres to work in the countryside, participate in labor, and work at the grassroots level. The cadres to be transferred include 19 cadres at the level of director and deputy director of departments, and director and deputy director of bureaus, as well as three members of the Provincial Party Committee. They will be assigned to work in pastoral and agricultural areas respectively. To strengthen leadership over grassroots units in the cultural and educational system, it has been determined to transfer more than 20 section-level and division-level cadres and key staff members from provincial-level organs to serve as principals, vice-principals, and political instructors in secondary schools and above.

In the first half of this year, organs at the county level and above in Qinghai Province transferred more than 7,600 cadres of various types and support personnel to work in grassroots units or participate in production in rural areas, initially strengthening the leadership of grassroots units, further strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses, and bringing about a new atmosphere in work and production. However, on the whole, the phenomena of bloated organizations and overstaffing in some organs have not been fundamentally changed. For example, Qinghai Normal College has 201 students but 113 faculty and staff members; Xining Department Store has 169 administrative management cadres, with a ratio of 1:1.73 to business personnel. Therefore, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee requires administrative organs and enterprises and institutions at all levels to vigorously overcome conservative thinking and resolutely streamline organizations and transfer cadres to production posts and grassroots units.

### 到生产战线劳动  到基层单位工作  青海紧缩机构抽调大批干部

    到生产战线劳动  到基层单位工作
    青海紧缩机构抽调大批干部
    新华社西宁26日电　中共青海省委员会经过几次会议讨论，决定继续紧缩机构和抽调大批干部参加生产劳动和到基层单位去工作。现在，青海省和西宁市级机关正在研究和制订紧缩机构和下放干部的计划。省级机关中已经确定合并的，有省委宣传部和文教部，建设委员会和计划委员会，商业厅和服务厅。财政贸易系统在今年上半年已经合并撤销七十个单位，现在准备再合并撤销三十个单位。西宁市也决定合并撤销十六个单位，将百货、专卖、蔬菜、纺织品、煤建、油脂等六个公司撤销，业务分别划归商业局和粮食局办理。
    在紧缩机构的同时，省、自治州和县所属机关预计可抽调一万几千名干部下乡参加劳动和到基层工作。将要下放的干部中包括正副厅长、正副部长级干部十九人，省委委员三人。他们将分别被调到牧业区和农业区去工作。为了加强对文教系统基层单位的领导，已确定从省级机关抽调二十多名处、科长级干部和主要科员干事，到中等以上学校去担任校长、副校长和政治教员。
    青海省县级以上机关在今年上半年已抽调各类干部和勤杂人员七千六百多人到基层单位工作或到农村参加生产，初步加强了基层单位的领导力量，进一步密切了党和人民群众的关系，工作上和生产上都出现了新气象。但是，总的来看，有些机关机构庞大和人浮于事的现象还没有得到根本改变。如青海省师范专科学校现有学生二百零一人，而教职员工就有一百一十三人；西宁市百货公司现有行政管理干部一百六十九人，和营业人员的比例是一比一点七三。因此，中共青海省委要求各级行政机关和企业、事业单位要大力克服保守思想，坚决紧缩机构和抽调干部下放到生产岗位和基层单位。
