American Black Curtain

	Victims of the Morbid Wind

	In the American market, all kinds of filthy, vulgar, and yellow magazines, pornographic photographs, and obscene pictures are breeding like mold after rain, bringing staggering profits to the bosses who run these depraved publications, while poisoning American teenagers, making them victims of the morbid wind.

	According to an investigation report published in May this year by a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate, the annual turnover of pornography and obscene pictures sold in the United States currently amounts to more than 500 million U.S. dollars. The same report pointed out that at least 200,000 teenagers under the age of 20 in the United States suffer from venereal diseases every year, more than twice the number of people suffering from tuberculosis, polio, acute arthritis, and hepatitis.

	The American "New York Herald Tribune" said that since the advent of penicillin, the spread of venereal diseases had once weakened. However, after 1947, venereal diseases spread again. In 1955, U.S. officials conducted a survey in 25 states and 14 major cities and found that venereal diseases were spreading seriously, and the first to suffer were teenagers who were infected by the morbid wind and became corrupted and degenerate.

	A person in charge of the American so-called "Social Hygiene Association," Reichman, said when talking about the fate of the victims of this morbid wind: "Once these teenagers are infected with venereal diseases, they have to leave school as soon as possible. As a result, they all become illiterate. Their best way out is prison."

    淫靡之风的牺牲者
    在美国市场上，形形色色的肮脏、下流的黄色杂志、色情照片、淫秽图画像雨后的霉菌一般地滋生着，为经营这些伤风败俗的出版物的老板带来了惊人的利润，同时却毒害了美国的青少年们，使他们成了淫靡之风的牺牲者。
    据美国国会参议院的一个小组调查委员会于今年5月发表的调查报告，美国国内目前每年出售色情照片与淫秽图画的营业额高达五亿美元以上。同一报告指出，美国二十岁以下的青少年，每年至少有二十万人患性病，比患肺结核、小儿麻痹症、急性关节炎和肝脏炎的人数多一倍以上。
    美国“纽约先驱论坛报”说，自从青霉素问世以来，性病蔓延的情况曾经一度减弱。可是1947年以后，性病又蔓延起来。美国官方曾于1955年在二十五个州、十四个大城市进行过一次调查，发现性病蔓延情况严重，而首先遭殃的是受了淫靡之风感染而腐化堕落的青少年。
    美国所谓“社会卫生协会”的一名负责人里希曼谈到这种淫靡之风的牺牲者的结局时说：“这些青少年，一旦染上性病，就不得不尽速离开学校。结果他们都成了文盲。他们的最好的出路就是监狱。”
