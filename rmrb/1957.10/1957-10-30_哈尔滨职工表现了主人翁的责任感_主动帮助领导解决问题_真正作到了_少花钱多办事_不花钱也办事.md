    Harbin, October 29 (This newspaper dispatch) In the rectification movement in more than 400 enterprises in Harbin, workers not only put forward more than 990,000 suggestions, but also many workers actively assisted leaders in solving problems, fully demonstrating the working class's sense of ownership.
    Before the rectification, the by-product workshop of the Heilongjiang Provincial Food Factory had not been able to solve the problem of uneven thickness of sausage casings for a considerable period. The product qualification rate was only about 60%, resulting in significant losses. During the blooming and contending period, some workers raised this issue. Hao Zong, a skilled worker, and two other workers studied the problem day and night for seven or eight days and finally discovered that the oil skin and mixing method were incorrect, finding a solution. The qualification rate has now increased to over 95%. The molding sand used by the foundry workers of the Harbin Machine Joint Factory used to be screened before molding. Due to the low hardness and poor air permeability of the sand, casting was prone to smoke, and the cast products had many air bubbles, affecting product quality. Taking water-heating boiler sections as an example, the scrap rate was as high as 30% due to improper management of the molding sand. After detailed research, technicians Han Shouzhi, An Jinglong, and others proposed that yellow soil, coarse sand, fine sand, and starch should be mixed in proportion after the molding sand is screened, adjusting the hardness of the molding sand. This solved a key quality issue in the production process of cast products, reducing the scrap rate of water-heating boiler sections to below 15%. The four-foot lathe in the Harbin Bearing Factory's lathe workshop, which processes inner grooves, was manually operated, which was very strenuous for the workers. During the blooming and contending period, workers proposed changing to pneumatic chucking. The construction worker, mechanical team leader, and chief engineer personally tested and installed the pneumatic chuck, reducing the workers' labor intensity and increasing daily output by 52.5%.
    Many workers implemented the spirit of "doing more with less money and getting things done without spending money" when solving production and living problems. In the locomotive and rolling stock repair factory, the final process of the passenger car workshop—assembly, painting, and coloring—was all done in one workshop. When the painters were coloring, other types of workers were also exposed to paint fumes. During the blooming and contending period, some workers requested the expansion of the workshop. Worker Li Yongqing said, "We should think of a way to not spend money. We can't just think about increasing equipment by spending money." He proposed painting each part of the passenger car before assembly, separating the various production types of workers. This not only solved the labor protection problem but also brought order to production.
    In the rectification work, the employees of Harbin Wire Factory and Songha Machinery Factory and other units also formed employee representatives to various units to supervise and inspect the rectification work. The results were very good. For example, in the sand turning room of a workshop of Songha Machinery Factory, a three-meter high and one-and-a-half-meter wide window had no glass. The cold wind was bone-chilling. The workers raised objections, but they were not resolved in a timely manner. After the representatives inspected the room, they immediately raised this with the factory improvement team, and the matter was immediately resolved.

### 哈尔滨职工表现了主人翁的责任感  主动帮助领导解决问题  真正作到了“少花钱多办事”“不花钱也办事”

    哈尔滨职工表现了主人翁的责任感
    主动帮助领导解决问题
    真正作到了“少花钱多办事”“不花钱也办事”
    本报哈尔滨29日电　在哈尔滨四百多个企业的整风运动中，职工不仅提出了九十九万多条意见，而且许多工人还主动协助领导解决问题，充分表现了工人阶级主人翁的责任感。
    整风之前，黑龙江省食品工厂的副产品车间，相当长的时间始终没有解决肠衣弦的粗细不匀的问题，产品合格率只达到60％左右，损失很大。鸣放期间有的工人提出这个问题。技术工人郝宗就和其他两位工人，不分昼夜地研究了七、八天，终于发现了油皮和配匀方法不对头，找到了解决办法，现在合格率已提高到95％以上。哈尔滨机联机器厂铸造工人使用的型砂，过去是过筛后制型，由于砂子硬度不强，透气不良，浇铸容易呛火，铸出的产品气泡多，影响产品质量。以水暖锅炉片为例，由于型砂管理不当，废品率竟高达30％。技工韩守志、安景龙等人经过详细研究后提出：型砂过筛后有比例地掺拌黄土、粗砂、细砂和淀粉，调合了型砂的软硬度，解决了铸造产品生产过程中的一个质量关键，使水暖锅炉片的废品率降低到15％以下。哈尔滨轴承厂车工车间加工内沟的四尺车床，是用手打胎，工人很吃力。鸣放中工人提出要改汽压卡胎，施工员、机械组长和总工长等人，亲自动手试验安装上了汽压卡胎，减轻了工人劳动强度，日产量也提高了52.5％。
    许多工人在解决生产和生活问题时，都贯彻了“少花钱多办事，不花钱也办事”的精神。机车车辆修理厂客车车间的最后一道工序——装配、喷漆、刷色，都在一个厂房里工作，油工刷色时，其他工种也跟着受油烟熏。在鸣放中有些工人要求扩建厂房。工人李永庆说：“应该想个不用花钱的办法，不能单从花钱增加设备上想。”他提出了先把客车各部件喷漆后再装配，使各生产工种分开作。这样，既解决了劳动保护问题，生产也有了秩序。
    在整改工作中，哈尔滨电线厂和松哈机械厂等单位的职工还组成了职工代表到各单位督促检查整改工作情况，收效很好。如松哈机械厂一车间翻砂室，有个三公尺高一公尺半宽的门窗没有玻璃，寒风刺骨，工人提了意见没有及时解决；代表视察后立即向厂改进组提出，马上得到了解决。
