Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Stockholm -- The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held a meeting in Stockholm from October 26th to 29th. The meeting adopted the following five documents: 1. Telegram to the United Nations regarding the situation in Syria; 2. Declaration on the threats against Syria; 3. General Resolution; 4. Appeal for convening a Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference; 5. Appeal for holding a "Two-Week Campaign Against Nuclear Weapon Testing."

In the "Telegram to the United Nations regarding the situation in Syria," the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council requested the United Nations General Assembly to urge the governments concerned to declare or reaffirm their guarantees to the Assembly that they would not resort to force and would respect the sovereignty and integrity of Syria. It also appealed to the Assembly to take urgent measures to eliminate the threat to Syria, especially the dangers involved in the massive concentration of troops in the region. It hoped that the United Nations, in the spirit of its Charter, would assume its full responsibilities and ensure that no aggression could be launched in this region under any pretext.

The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council's "Declaration on the Threats Against Syria" called on peace advocates worldwide to speak out in unison to prevent the outbreak of hostilities in Syria, end interference and pressure, and safeguard Syria's independence and sovereignty.

The "General Resolution" of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council called on peace forces to remain vigilant and work to steer the world away from the dangerous path of increasing division. It condemned the threat posed by the policy of strength to world peace, and particularly condemned the conspiracy of certain countries to carry out military intervention in Syria. It also pointed out that France should take steps to end the war in Algeria and open the way for negotiations; in Europe, efforts should be made to organize a security system with the participation of all countries and to promote the reunification of Germany. The General Resolution also emphasized that the People's Republic of China must enjoy its rightful place in the United Nations, and the World Peace Council supports all efforts to achieve this goal.

The General Resolution finally called for an end to the nuclear arms race, the promotion of disarmament, and the holding of a summit conference of major powers to eliminate mutual hostility and misunderstanding.

In the other two documents adopted, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council announced its decision to convene a Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference in mid-1958, and called on national peace committees to organize the broadest and most diverse mass actions from November 10th to 25th, 1957, to support an immediate cessation of nuclear testing.
