　　Yunnan Border Region Has Modern Industry
    The Working Class of Minority Nationalities Grows Rapidly
    Kunming Dispatch from our Newspaper, October 19th: The industrial development in the border regions of Yunnan Province is rapid. The total industrial output value of the six autonomous prefectures (districts) of Xishuangbanna, Dehong, Diqing, Dali, Nujiang, and Honghe in 1956 was equivalent to 426.8% of that in 1949. In the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, before liberation, there was only a small power plant and a match factory in Baoshan and Tengchong. Other remote counties such as Ruili and Lianshan didn't even have handicraft workshops. Now, there are 19 factories in the entire prefecture, including 10 modern factories. In Gongshan Dulong and Nu Autonomous County of Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, there wasn't even basic handicraft industry in the past. Farmers have always used wooden and stone tools for production. Now, there is an iron factory that manufactures agricultural tools, and there are already more than 30 Lisu, Dulong, and Nu technical workers. Other border areas such as Yuanyang, Zhenkang, Gengma, Zhongdian, and Weixi also have factories and enterprises for mining, processing, and manufacturing various daily necessities. The various systems under the Yunnan Provincial Department of Industry have recently newly built and rebuilt 56 factories and mines in the border minority areas of Lijiang, Simao, Qujing, Wenshan, and Lincang, including coal, iron, zinc mines, paper making, ceramics, sugar refining, oil pressing, cotton ginning, and power generation factories. These factories will be put into production successively in the fourth quarter of this year.
    With the development of industrial construction in the border ethnic areas, the working class of ethnic minorities in Yunnan is growing rapidly. All ethnic groups have their own children participating in national construction and industrial production. According to incomplete statistics, among the more than 200,900 employees in the province, there are already more than 24,000 ethnic minority employees (including more than 19,000 workers). 90% of these ethnic minority employees participated in production and construction after liberation. Now, they have all mastered certain production skills, and many have also joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. (He Guozhi)

　　云南边疆有了现代工业
    少数民族的工人阶级迅速成长
    本报昆明19日电  云南省边疆民族地区的工业发展迅速。西双版纳、德宏、迪庆、大理、怒江、红河等六个自治州（区）的工业生产总值，1956年就已经相当于1949年的426.8％。德宏傣族景颇族自治州，解放以前除保山、腾冲两地有一个小发电厂和一个火柴厂外，其他瑞丽、莲山等边远县份连手工业作坊也没有。现在，全州已经有十九个工厂，其中还有十个现代化的工厂。怒江傈僳族自治州的贡山独龙族怒族自治县，在过去连起码的手工业也没有，农民历来都是用木石农具生产，现在已经有了制造农具的铁工厂，并且已经有了三十多个傈僳、独龙、怒族的技术工人。元阳、镇康、耿马、中甸、维西等其他边疆地区也都有了采矿、加工和制造各种日用品的工厂企业。云南省工业厅所属各系统最近又在丽江、思茅、曲靖、文山、临沧等边疆民族地区新建和改建了五十六个厂矿，包括煤、铁、锌矿、造纸、陶瓷、制糖、榨油、轧花和发电等工厂。这些工厂将在今年第四季度陆续投入生产。
    随着边疆民族地区工业建设的发展，云南少数民族的工人阶级正在迅速成长。各民族都有自己的子弟参加了国家建设和工业生产。据不完全的统计，全省二十万零九千多名职工中，少数民族职工已经有二万四千多人（其中有工人一万九千多名）。这些少数民族职工，90％都是解放以后参加生产建设的。现在，他们都已经掌握了一定的生产技能，有很多人还参加了共产党和共青团。  （和国治）
