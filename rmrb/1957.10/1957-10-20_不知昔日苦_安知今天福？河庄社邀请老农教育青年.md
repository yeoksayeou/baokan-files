    Not Knowing the Bitterness of the Past, How Can One Know the Happiness of Today?
　　Hezhuang Cooperative Invites Old Farmers to Educate Youth
    (Our Dispatch) The Hezhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, during the great debate, had elderly farmers use their personal experiences to educate young people.
    During the unrestrained airing of views, some young people in the Hezhuang Cooperative proposed that "old people enjoyed good fortune when they were young, and now young people suffer," "old people had food to eat when they were young, and now we don't have enough food," "ten chi [Chinese foot] of cloth coupons can't make much clothing," and generally said, "there's no future in the countryside." League members Su Yonglin and Chen Qiying even said, "In the countryside, they say labor is glorious, but in reality, it's just messing around in the mud!"
    In response to these ideological situations, the Cooperative's Youth League branch, under the leadership of the Party branch and the work team, organized a debate between young people and old people. The old people presented facts and reasoned to criticize the erroneous thinking of some young people. Fifty-seven-year-old Tian Lao Tai (Old Woman Tian) said, "Speaking of life, it's thousands of times better now than when I was young. I remember very clearly, when I married into my husband's family at nineteen, I would cook a basket of pumpkins in the morning and take it to the fields to work, and when I came home in the evening, I would still eat pumpkins. Now everyone complains of hardship if they eat one meal of pumpkins a day, and they still think 520 jin [approximately 260 kg] of grain a year is not enough. Where could we get that in the past! In the past, when I gave birth to children, I lacked rice and vegetables, and couldn't eat anything. Now when young women give birth to children, not only do they have food to eat, but they have good nutrition, and the cooperative also subsidizes 150 work points." Old farmer Chen Ashun said to the young people in his team, "When I was young, I worked for the landlord during the day and worked at home in the evening, sometimes only eating two meals a day. One day, there was no rice at home, and my mother went to many houses but couldn't borrow even half a grain of rice. The whole family of seven cried and closed the door to sleep. Now you have three meals a day and even snacks. You haven't experienced the suffering of the old society, and you are young, so when you hear some well-to-do middle peasants complaining about not having enough grain, you follow suit. In the past, only landlords, rich peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants ate a lot, like me, eating 300 to 400 jin a year was considered not bad." Tian Lao Tai also said, "There's even no need to talk about clothing. My cotton-padded jacket has been worn for decades like lard residue. In December, I still wore single pants, the northwest wind was piercingly painful, the bed was padded with broken mats, and only a few chi of cloth were used a year." She said to the seven or eight young women present, "Every one of you is wearing better clothes now than I did when I got married, colorful and wearing wool sweaters. Like Caiqin, she's wearing a wool sweater and knitting another one." She also pulled on the wool sweater she was wearing and said, "Thanks to the Communist Party, I've lived for over fifty years and only now have I put on a wool sweater." When talking about the question of "whether young people have a future in the countryside," old farmer Tian Huacheng said, "In the past, peasants were regarded as inferior people. In the new society, people who do a good job in labor are evaluated as models and meet Chairman Mao. Isn't this a future? Everyone can also go to training classes to learn politics and culture. The future is bright." Tian Lao Tai said, "You see, the cooperative is becoming more and more consolidated. By planting the fields, everyone has food to eat and clothes to wear, and supports the country's industrialization. I think it's extremely glorious and has a great future."
    Through such presentation of facts and reasoning, dozens of young people present felt that the old people's words were pertinent and felt the happiness of being born in the era of Mao Zedong. They all expressed that they would learn from the old people's hard-working and simple style, conserve grain, ensure that every grain returns home during the autumn harvest, and settle down to produce in the countryside. Young Sun Zaihua expressed that he would strive to be a model in production. League member Chen Juying said, "In the past, we were not aware of the blessings we were in, and did not know the suffering of our predecessors. Today, after listening to the old people's words, I have cleared my mind."

### 不知昔日苦  安知今天福？河庄社邀请老农教育青年

    不知昔日苦  安知今天福？
　　河庄社邀请老农教育青年
    本报讯  江苏省昆山县河庄农业社在大辩论中，老年农民以亲身的经历教育了青年人。
    河庄社的部分青年在大鸣大放中，提出“老年人在年轻时享福，现在青年人吃苦”、“老年人年轻时有饭吃，我们现在粮食不够吃”、“十尺布票做不得啥衣服”，并普遍地说：“在农村里没前途。”团员苏永林、陈启英还说：“在农村嘴上说劳动光荣，实际是扒烂泥！”
    针对这些思想情况，该社团支部在党支部和工作组的领导下，组织了青年和老年人参加的辩论会，由老年人摆事实、讲道理，批判部分青年人的错误思想。五十七岁的田老太太说：“要讲生活，现在要比我年轻时好上几千倍。我记得很清楚，十九岁嫁到婆家，早晨烧好一篮南瓜带下田干活，黄昏回家还是吃南瓜。现在大家一天吃一顿南瓜就喊苦，一年吃五百二十斤粮食还嫌少，过去那里吃得到！过去，我生了孩子，缺米少菜的，什么也吃不上。现在青年妇女生孩子，不仅有饭吃，有好营养，社里还补贴一百五十个工分。”老农陈阿顺对本队的青年说：“我年轻时白天帮地主干活，晚上到自己家里干活，有时一天只能吃两顿。有一天，家里无米，我妈出去跑了好多家，没借到半粒米，全家七人哭了一场关起门来睡觉。现在你们一天三顿，还得吃点心。你们没经过旧社会的苦，年纪轻，听着某些富裕中农喊粮不够吃，就跟着喊。过去吃饭多的只有地主、富农和富裕中农，像我，一年吃上三四百斤就算不差了。”田老太太又说：“穿衣就更不用说了。我的一件棉袄，穿了几十年像猪油渣一样。12月里还是穿单裤，西北风刺骨痛，床上垫的是破席子，一年也用不到几尺布。”她对到会的七、八个青年妇女说：“你们现在穿的那一个不比我出嫁时还好，花花绿绿的，还穿着绒线外套。像采琴身上穿着绒线衣，手里还织着绒线衣。”她又拉拉自己身上穿的一件绒线衣说：“我托共产党的福，活了五十多岁才穿上绒线衣。”在谈到“青年人在农村有无出息”的问题时，老农田华成就说：“过去农民被人看作下贱人，新社会劳动好的人，评上模范见到毛主席，这不是前途吗？大家还能到训练班去学政治、文化，前途一片光明。”田老太太说：“你们看，合作社越来越巩固。种了田，大家才有饭吃，有衣穿，支援国家工业化，我看是顶光荣，也顶有前途。”
    通过这样的摆事实讲道理，到会几十个青年人都感到老年人的话句句中肯，感到生在毛泽东时代的幸福。他们都表示要学习老年人艰苦朴素的作风，节约粮食，在秋收中做到颗粒还家，安心在农村生产。青年孙再华表示要在生产上争取做模范，团员陈菊英说：“我们过去是身在福中不知福，不知前人苦，今天听了老人的话，使我清醒了头脑。”
