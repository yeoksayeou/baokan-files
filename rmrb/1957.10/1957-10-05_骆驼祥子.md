    "Rickshaw Boy"
    Original work by Lao She
    Adapted and directed by Mei Qian
    Performed by the Beijing People's Art Theatre
    The play "Rickshaw Boy" differs slightly from the novel in terms of characters and plot. Due to the need for "concentrated expression" in stage art, some scenes in the novel have been merged or abbreviated. The current play focuses on Xiangzi's personal struggle, with his love life with Huniu (the daughter of the car owner, Liu Siye) as the main thread, and through the life experiences of Xiaofuzi, Erqiangzi, Lao Ma, Dagezi, etc., reveals the sharp contradictions between the oppressors and the oppressed from various aspects. Regarding Xiangzi, the novel's author, limited by the times, could not loudly advocate revolution and "dared not explicitly state why he did not rebel," and could only write him as "a product of social disease, the ghost at the end of individualism." Now, the audience can see his bright future in the play. The play also introduces a character not present in the original work—Xiao Shunzi, created by the adapter based on the young rickshaw puller who pulled "red difference" (parading revolutionaries to the execution ground) in the novel, using him as a stark contrast to Xiangzi throughout the play, showing the two paths laborers take toward revolution.
    The performance of "Rickshaw Boy" is moving. Comrade Shu Xiuwen, who plays Huniu, demonstrates accurate and refined movements, subtle and nuanced expressions, embodying Huniu's forthright and uninhibited personality. The actors playing Xiangzi (played by Li Xiang), Liu Si (played by Ying Ruocheng), Lao Ma (played by Yu Shizhi), Erqiangzi (played by Tong Chao), Xiaofuzi (played by Song Fengyi), and Xiao Shunzi (played by Lin Liankun) also accurately embody the inner truth of the characters.

    “骆驼祥子”
    老舍原著
    梅阡改编、导演
    北京人民艺术剧院演出
    “骆驼祥子”从小说到话剧，人物、情节略有不同。由于舞台艺术需要“集中表现”，因此小说中的若干场面被归并或节略了。现在的话剧是以祥子个人奋斗为中心，以同虎妞（车主刘四爷的女儿）的爱情生活为主线，通过小福子、二强子、老马、大个子等的生活遭遇，从各方面揭示出压迫者与被压迫者之间的尖锐矛盾。关于祥子，当年小说作者限于时代，不能高呼革命，“不敢明言他为什么不造反”，只能把他写成“社会病胎里的产儿，个人主义的末路鬼”，现在观众在剧里可以看出他有着光明的前途。剧中还出现了一个原作里没有的人物——小顺子，是改编者根据小说中拉过“红差”（拉革命者游街赴刑场）的年轻车夫塑造的，以此作为祥子的鲜明对比贯穿在剧中，显示出劳动者走向革命的两条道路。
    “骆驼祥子”的演出是动人的。饰虎妞的舒绣文同志动作准确洗练，表情细腻入微，体现出了虎妞爽朗、粗犷的个性。饰祥子（李翔饰）、刘四（英若诚饰）、老马（于是之饰）、二强子（童超饰）、小福子（宋凤仪饰）、小顺子（林连琨饰）等演员，也都确当地体现了人物的内心真实。　（冬青）
