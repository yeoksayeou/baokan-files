Masses Mobilized, Institutions Rationally Simplified, Work Efficiency Improved
Shenyang Many Factories Experience Profound Changes

    This newspaper reports that the rectification and socialist education movement has caused profound changes in factories and enterprises in Shenyang. Many factories are actively simplifying enterprise management structures with revolutionary spirit, and a large number of management cadres are taking the initiative to return to production posts and participate in physical labor.

    The Shenyang Screw Factory, which first proposed simplifying management institutions, had about the same workload this year as in 1955, but the number of management personnel increased by 42% compared to 1955. As a result, the phenomenon of bloated institutions, low efficiency, and overstaffing was very serious. Some jobs that could be done by one person were done by two, and some people only worked two hours a day. Even a relatively simple new product required a plan to be submitted seventy days in advance. The new plan is based on the original structure, classifying and arranging various activities of the enterprise, and taking into account the nature and amount of work. Special attention is paid to assigning matters of similar nature and close connection to one department for management, in order to avoid the shortcomings of duplication and mutual hindrance. The phenomenon of one matter being managed by several departments in the past has also been changed. According to the new plan, the factory will reduce from nineteen departments to nine departments, and from eight workshops to seven workshops. Management personnel will be reduced from 503 to 243, from 23% of the total number of employees to 11%. This plan was announced on October 6. After several days of discussion, the workers unanimously agreed to the reform, and many technicians and staff filled out applications requesting to be transferred to the front line of production.

    During the "big blooming and contending" at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, employees were mobilized to conduct special blooming and contending on the issue of simplifying enterprise management institutions. During the blooming and contending, many employees suggested that the Personnel Section, Labor and Wage Section, and Education Section be merged into one section, because the work of these three sections is inseparable. In the past, disputes often occurred because the three sections were managed separately. Merging into one section not only facilitates work, but also reduces the number of personnel from 41 to 18. Employees also suggested that the Process Section, Forging and Metallurgy Section, and Tool Section with similar nature be merged into the Construction Section, and the Health Section and Welfare Section can also be merged. After considering the suggestions of the masses, the leadership decided to merge 21 sections into 13 sections, and 11 workshops into 6 workshops. Management cadres were reduced from 1,158 to 645. During the discussion of this plan, employees also put forward many supplementary opinions, such as suggesting the abolition of the large Capital Construction Section, leaving only a repair team. Some suggested that the director's office could also be abolished, leaving one or two secretaries and researchers. The factory leadership is now further studying the opinions put forward by everyone, and it is expected that this plan will be fully implemented by mid-November.

    The Shenyang Power Plant Machinery Factory has reduced from twenty departments to ten departments, and has delegated twenty-one section chiefs and workshop directors, of which nine have directly participated in production. The Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has also proposed a simplified plan, reducing from eighteen departments to fourteen departments, and from ten workshops to three joint workshops. The Sujiatun Abrasive Wheel Factory, Shenyang No. 2 Machinery Factory, and other factories have also proposed plans to simplify enterprise management institutions.

### 群众发动起来，机构合理简化，工作效率提高  沈阳许多工厂发生深刻变化

    群众发动起来，机构合理简化，工作效率提高
    沈阳许多工厂发生深刻变化
    本报讯　整风和社会主义教育运动，已在沈阳的工厂企业中引起了深刻的变化，不少工厂积极以革命精神简化企业管理机构，大批管理干部主动要求回到生产岗位参加体力劳动。
    最早提出简化管理机构的沈阳螺钉厂，今年的任务量与1955年差不多，但管理人员却比1955年增加了42％，因而机构臃肿、效率很低、人浮于事的现象十分严重。有些原来一个人可干的两个人干，有些人一天只干两小时的活。一项比较简易的新产品，也必须提前七十天提出计划。新方案是以原有机构为基础，把企业各种活动进行分类排列，又考虑了工作性质和工作量而制订的。特别注意把性质相近、联系比较密切的事项划归一个科室管理，以避免重复互相掣肘的缺点，过去一个事项被几个科分散管理的现象也有所改变。根据新方案，这个厂将由十九个科室减少至九个科室，八个车间减至七个车间。管理人员由五百零三人减缩至二百四十三人，由过去的占职工总数23％降到11％。这个方案已于10月6日宣布，经过几天的讨论，职工一致赞同这项改革，许多技术人员和职员纷纷填写申请书，要求把自己调到生产第一线去。
    沈阳矿山机器厂在大鸣大放中，就简化企业管理机构问题发动职工进行了专题鸣放。在鸣放中，不少职工建议人事科、劳动工资科、教育科合并为一科，因为这三个科的工作本是不可分割的，过去因三头分管经常发生扯皮现象，合并为一个科不仅便于工作，而且人员亦可由四十一人减至十八人。职工也建议将性质相近的工艺科、锻冶科、工具科合并为施工科，卫生科和福利科亦可合并。领导考虑了群众的建议后，决定将二十一个科室合并为十三个科室，十一个车间合并为六个车间，管理干部由一千一百五十八人减少到六百四十五人。职工在讨论这个方案中还提出不少补充意见，如建议撤销庞大的基建科，只留下一个修缮队。有的提出厂长办公室也可撤销，留下一二个秘书和调查研究人员也就行了，现在工厂领导上正在进一步研究大家提出来的意见，预计这个方案到11月中旬即可全部实行。
    沈阳电厂机械厂已将二十个科室减缩为十个科室，已下放科长车间主任二十一人，其中有九个人直接参加了生产。皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂亦已提出简化方案，将十八个科室减少到十四个科室，十个车间减为三个联合车间。苏家屯砂轮厂、沈阳第二机械厂等厂也都提出了简化企业管理机构的方案。
