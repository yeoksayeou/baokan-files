The question of Agricultural Mechanization in China
Huang Jing, Director of the State Technology Commission

Why is mechanization still needed in China, where there are more people than land in rural areas?

The main way to increase agricultural production in China is to increase yield per unit area, with land reclamation being secondary. The methods to increase yield per unit area are: fertilizer, water conservancy, intensive cultivation, multiple cropping, seed selection, high-yield crops, pest control, etc. These are all certain. As for the mechanization of agricultural power and tools, we have had two changes in our understanding.

Before 1956, we generally recognized that agriculture must undergo technical transformation on the basis of social reform. We had a superficial understanding of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union and the United States. We generally believed that mechanization could improve labor productivity, increase production, and was a major direction of agricultural technical transformation. Although we also considered that China's conditions were insufficient and that we should gradually transition from animal-powered farm tools to mechanization, we did not study the specific conditions of China's rural areas well, and only used the quotas of foreign agricultural machinery for calculation. Therefore, the long-term plan for agricultural machinery was too high in level and too urgent in progress; the planned varieties were too few, and they were copied from foreign products.

The construction upsurge in 1956 compared our national strength and made us realize the complexity and arduousness of building socialism in such a large country with "poverty and blankness" and a large population. We began to consider the fundamental characteristic of China's agriculture with more people than land. The Soviet Union and the United States are countries with vast land and sparse population, where there is a shortage of agricultural labor. Using mechanization to replace manpower, improve labor productivity, and expand cultivated land has achieved significant production increases and accumulated relatively quickly. China's characteristics are different from theirs. Although the country is very large, there is not much cultivated land, not much reclaimable wasteland, and the population is relatively large. Under these circumstances, increasing agricultural production must take more complex routes such as intensive cultivation; at the same time, most foreign agricultural machinery is suitable for dryland farming on plains and large plots of land, and most of them use petroleum as fuel. Due to China's natural and resource characteristics, such as many hills, many paddy fields, small fields, and lack of petroleum, the requirements for agricultural machinery are also more complex. Promoting foreign machinery in dryland plains is relatively close to the mark, but it is not applicable in all regions. This shows that China's agricultural technical transformation must combine with China's characteristics when absorbing foreign advanced experience, that is, it should have its own path. We studied the central government's instructions and clarified the policy that agricultural technical transformation must suit China's agricultural conditions, advance steadily, and focus on increasing yield per unit area. However, during this period, we had some one-sided views on the speed and scope of agricultural mechanization: we opposed the policy of increasing yield per unit area to mechanization, believing that since the effect of agricultural mechanization is mainly to improve labor productivity, it would not have any significant effect on increasing yield per unit area; mechanization is certainly needed in areas with insufficient manpower, but in areas with more people than land, except for water drainage and irrigation, which must use some machinery, promoting mechanization in cultivation and harvesting will only cause a surplus of manpower, which is not of much benefit to increasing production, but will cost a lot of investment; furthermore, the petroleum problem has not yet been solved. Therefore, at that time, we believed that the progress of agricultural mechanization in China could only be slow, and its implementation scope could only be very limited. These views seemed to be combined with China's actual situation, but in reality, the understanding was still vague, and no in-depth investigation and research were conducted on the actual situation in rural areas, especially the development trend after cooperation.

Recently, we organized a group of cadres and technicians to go to the countryside for investigation, and further exchanged opinions with agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments. We began to understand some of the specific conditions in rural areas, which are very different from what we imagined in Beijing; Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural mechanization have further clarified our understanding of this issue, indicating that our past understanding was wrong. After agricultural cooperation, the development of agriculture and sideline production has greatly changed the situation in rural areas. The lack of labor during the busy farming season has become a common problem. Even in the most densely populated areas, well-managed cooperatives have experienced a serious shortage of manpower and animal power during the busy farming season, hindering the implementation of various production increase measures. Therefore, it is necessary to use machinery to alleviate the difficulties of insufficient manpower and animal power. Moreover, if mechanization is used properly, it can increase yield per unit area more effectively than animal-powered farm tools (deeper plowing, more even sowing, faster action, and able to seize the farming season); if managed well, the cost can also be lower than manpower and animal power. Therefore, it is still necessary to actively promote agricultural mechanization step by step and with emphasis according to different economic and technical conditions, without waiting for a considerable period of time. The so-called step-by-step and focused promotion is to actively promote the mechanization of agriculture according to the degree of economic development after agricultural cooperation, the gradual increase in the need for mechanical equipment, the specific circumstances of the urgency of needs, the characteristics of different regions, the possibility of rural purchases and factory production of these machines, and the economic gains and losses in the promotion process, rather than holding a passive and waiting attitude and solving it slowly. According to our initial understanding, the current demand for mechanization in rural areas is mainly due to the following reasons:

First, due to the increase in the multiple cropping index, the amount of labor invested in the land has greatly increased. In the North China Plain, the average cultivated land is about three mu per person, in East China and Southwest China it is about two mu, and in South China it is less than two mu. These areas are considered to have more people than land. Although there are many people, the problem of seasonal unevenness between busy and idle seasons is still serious. Most areas in China have a long frost-free period and can be used for multiple cropping. With the promotion of multiple cropping, the busy farming season becomes even busier. For example, in the North China Plain, to change from one crop to two crops, the busiest time of the year is concentrated in about sixty days (twenty days from wheat harvesting to autumn planting, and forty days from autumn harvesting to wheat planting). At this time, both harvesting and planting, as well as irrigation, are required. In addition, due to the lack of livestock, manpower has to replace animal power, making manpower even more insufficient. The frost-free period in the Yangtze River basin is about 250 days, and the number of days suitable for rice growth is even less. The growing period of double-cropping rice is about 210 to 220 days, and the gap between them is only a few days or ten to twenty days. Harvesting, plowing, harrowing, fertilizing, and transplanting are all squeezed into these few days, which is very tense. Farmers say that to grow double-cropping rice well, it is best to achieve "early yellow and late green" (that is, harvest early rice in the morning and transplant late rice seedlings in the evening). In many areas, because they are too busy, they have to give up multiple cropping even if they can, or they miss the time, and the late rice cannot ripen, or they have to plant the late rice coarsely, resulting in reduced yields. Although the frost-free period in South China and Southwest China is even longer, the tension of labor has not been reduced because they have the conditions to strive for three crops. Therefore, the current limitation on the increase of the multiple cropping index is mainly due to the lack of manpower and animal power (and also the lack of fertilizer). Therefore, the current shortage of labor in the South is even more serious than in the North, which has a sparser population. Farmers describe the busy farming season as "wanting grain but not life."

Second, various water conservancy measures have also greatly increased the amount of agricultural labor. Especially in the North China Plain, irrigation is a big problem. If it is done well, it can bring great economic benefits. Mengzhuang Nanli Village in Huixian County, Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province is an example. They developed water sources in arid areas (drilling wells, opening canals), increased fertilizer application, and improved cultivation methods. Before harvesting wheat, they used rice seedling methods to cultivate millet seedlings. After harvesting wheat, they irrigated and planted millet seedlings. After harvesting millet, they planted cabbage and radish, and after the vegetables ripened, they planted wheat again. Therefore, there are many fields there that produce thousands of catties of grain and ten thousand catties of vegetables per mu per year. The key to their increased production lies in irrigation, which turns dry land into paddy fields, changes one season to multiple seasons, and implements "three fertilizers and five waters" (applying fertilizer three times and irrigating five times), intensive cultivation. Xinxiang Prefecture has also taken different water conservancy measures for other types of land: in low-lying areas, paddy fields and water crops are cultivated, with wheat and rice rotation; in waterlogged areas, rainwater that cannot be drained is surrounded layer by layer, allowing it to evaporate and penetrate on the spot, preventing waterlogging. They call this: "restricting, utilizing, and transforming" water; in hilly areas, terraced fields, ridge fields, ponds, and dams are built; in saline-alkali land, deep wells are drilled to extract fresh water for irrigation and flushing, and the groundwater level of bitter water is lowered to transform saline-alkali land into good land. These all require a lot of labor. Especially when water is urgently needed, it is also the busiest time in the fields. In addition, accumulating fertilizer, transporting manure, threshing grain, chopping grass, and grinding all require a lot of manpower and animal power. As a result, manpower and animal power are greatly insufficient. Therefore, they urgently need mechanical power to alleviate the tension of manpower and animal power, so that manpower and animal power can be freed up for intensive cultivation, or to manage fruit trees and other sideline businesses. They say that if these are done well, seven or eight fen of land will be enough to support one person.

The development of production has increased the need for animal power, but the increase in livestock is very slow, and some places have even decreased. Therefore, the lack of livestock is a common phenomenon. Livestock eat a lot. One large animal is about equivalent to three adults. Therefore, feed competes with grain, cash crops, and fuel for land. Insufficient feed also restricts the breeding of livestock. In many areas, people are pulling plows and pushing waterwheels. This situation is very common in Longyao and other three counties in Xingtai Prefecture, where more than 58,000 people pulled plows this spring, and in northern Anhui. These situations make the need for mechanical power in some areas even more urgent.

Third, cultivation is becoming more and more meticulous, and sideline businesses are also increasing, so manpower and animal power are becoming more and more insufficient.

There are two cooperatives in Heze County, Shandong Province, one called "June 1st Cooperative" and the other called "August 1st Cooperative." These two cooperatives are adjacent to each other, only six li apart. The natural conditions are similar, the average cultivated land per person is 2.5 mu, and there is one animal per 30 mu of land. The crop situation is also very similar. There is a tractor station nearby, but the attitudes of these two cooperatives towards tractor plowing are completely opposite: the June 1st Cooperative is very opposed to using tractors for plowing. The members say: if the tractor plows one more mu of land, it will rob us of one mu of work points. They said to the cooperative director: You say the machine plows deep, how deep do you want it to plow, we can also dig that deep. The August 1st Cooperative is the opposite. The members actively request machine plowing. They say: If the machine doesn't work, the members won't be able to divide more. The natural conditions of these two cooperatives are similar, but their views are completely opposite. What is the reason?

First, the August 1st Cooperative requires machine plowing because they have more field management work and a higher degree of intensive cultivation. They use 24 workdays per mu per year, while the June 1st Cooperative only uses 18 workdays. The field work of the August 1st Cooperative (harrowing, plowing, weeding, pest control, top dressing, base fertilizer, etc.) has increased more than twice compared to before, so the yield of wheat per mu is 213 catties, while the June 1st Cooperative only produces 140 catties. Second, the August 1st Cooperative has more sideline businesses. They have 13 kinds of sideline businesses (oil workshops, sugar workshops, flour workshops, kiln industry, woodware, iron industry, sewing, breeding, horticulture, carts, chicken coops, straw houses, mills, etc.). Among the 700 laborers, 114 are engaged in sideline businesses, and among the 118 animals, 63 are also engaged in sideline businesses; while the June 1st Cooperative, although it has seven or eight kinds of sideline businesses, only 20 people participate. No one is idle in the August 1st Cooperative. Even a cripple and a blind person are arranged to pull the bellows in the tea stove room. They do not have the problem of surplus labor, but only feel insufficient, so they want tractors. The June 1st Cooperative is overstaffed and抢活干 with the tractor station. The working group that went down to investigate summarized the four conditions for machine plowing as: (1) The labor force within the cooperative has arrangements and outlets (intensive cultivation, sideline businesses); (2) The economic foundation of the cooperative is relatively thick; (3) The management is relatively good; (4) The increase in production is very significant.

From the above, it can be seen that after the socialist transformation of agriculture, the relations of production have changed, and the productive forces are developing rapidly. There must be new views on the issue of agricultural population and agricultural mechanization. The key problem in rural areas at present is the problem of unevenness between busy and idle seasons. Therefore, the key to rural prosperity and increased production in the future lies in having machines to help when they are too busy during the busy farming season, so that they can get through the busy season; when they are idle, they have sideline businesses to do, so that they are not idle. Only in this way can farmers be freed from the distress of unevenness between busy and idle seasons, so that various measures to increase production can be smoothly implemented, and the labor productivity of rural areas can be increased more quickly.

As long as the management of the cooperative is proper, the amount of labor invested per mu will be more and more. In the future, with the implementation of the Agricultural Development Program; the increasing perfection of the cooperative's relations of production; the development of industry, and the increasingly close and strengthened cooperation between industry and agriculture; the development of this trend will become more and more intense. Changing one season to multiple seasons, changing dry land to paddy fields, fertilizing, draining and irrigating water conservancy, land transformation, intensive cultivation, pest control, and developing sideline production, all of this requires more and more manpower and animal power. Therefore, although there is little land and many people, there are more things that can be done and need to be done, and labor and animal power will increasingly feel insufficient. The insufficient amount of labor urgently needs to be replaced by mechanical power and mechanical tools, and human labor needs to gradually shift to those parts that require more skills and cannot be replaced by machines. Therefore, machines and manpower complement each other. Correctly and gradually implementing mechanization has a significant effect on increasing yield per unit area, and these two can and should be combined.

How to design and use agricultural machinery according to the characteristics of agricultural production?

The characteristics of agricultural production in China, in terms of terrain, include various types such as paddy fields, dry land, plains, mountains, wasteland, swamps, and saline-alkali land; the soil is also different; in terms of cultivation technology, there are various different methods such as flat cultivation, ridge cultivation, intercropping, crop rotation, ridge cultivation, hole fertilization, and ditch fertilization. The planting density and row spacing vary from place to place; Chinese agriculture has a good tradition in terms of intensive cultivation and diversified management; in terms of crops, there are many kinds and complex varieties of crops from tropical to temperate zones; in terms of climate, some need to resist drought and conserve moisture, some need to drain and prevent waterlogging, some need to be harvested during the rainy season, and some need to seize the freezing winter plowing; in terms of power resources, petroleum is scarce, the size of livestock varies greatly, and development is restricted, and the utilization of other energy sources urgently needs to be studied; in terms of agricultural economy, labor is cheap, agricultural products are cheap, agricultural accumulation is small, while steel is expensive and machinery is expensive, so the ability of rural areas to purchase machines is limited; in addition, farmers lack experience in using machines, and rural areas also lack a set of repair and service organizations for mechanical tools. At the same time, because agricultural mechanization must be developed gradually, in the process of transition from old to new, it is also necessary to combine the use of manpower, animal power, and mechanical power, mechanized farm tools and old-fashioned farm tools. If the combination is not good, it will offset the benefits of mechanization. These characteristics together form many extremely complex factors that must be considered for the development of agricultural machinery in China. Therefore, the following principles must be adopted in the design and use of agricultural machinery:

First, mechanization must be combined with China's original technical foundation of agriculture.

In the next few years, although China's agricultural machinery should still focus on the development of new-style animal-powered farm tools, machine-powered farm tools will increase year by year. The entry of machines into the countryside will inevitably produce a series of contradictions between the new and the old, such as the mechanization of major operations, while other operations still need to rely on manpower and animal power; new equipment needs to be used in combination with old equipment; new equipment conflicts with original agricultural methods, etc. For example, after machine plowing is adopted, the delivery of manure and turning over of the soil still rely on manual labor. One is fast, one is slow, one is deep, and one is shallow. If it is not organized well, it will be counterproductive. In places where this situation exists, farmers say: "Machine plowing is really enough, the more you help, the more you mess up." For example, there are contradictions between drainage and irrigation machinery and local methods of well digging. The wells dug by local methods are too shallow and the water volume is insufficient, and they are used up in a few days; moreover, there are too many well eyes, which take up too much land and divide the land into pieces, which conflicts with the use of tractors. After the new type of power machine is used, the water wheel cannot be matched, and the water pump must be refitted. Therefore, the promotion of agricultural machinery must adapt to the original technical foundation of agriculture and gradually improve it. It is necessary to make machines and livestock complement each other, and combine new and old farm tools. In recent years, farmers have created many good experiences in using new-style farm tools. For example, using the frame of a ten-row seeder to install weeding knives and soil-cultivating devices for inter-row cultivation and soil cultivation; modifying large-scale animal-powered farm tools such as double-furrow plows, seeders, and hay harvesters into tractor farm tools, which can be used by both machines and animals. In the future, the design of agricultural machinery should be considered from these aspects. Designers must go deep into the countryside and work closely with agronomists and experienced farmers to summarize farmers' advanced experience and create various mechanical equipment suitable for China's agricultural characteristics. Copying mechanically is doomed to failure. In the past, some places often cut their feet to fit the shoes, not making farm tools suitable for advanced cultivation methods, but forcing cultivation methods to suit farm tools, such as forcibly changing ridge cultivation to flat cultivation, changing intercropping of soybeans and corn to single cropping, and changing grasping manure and spot planting to base fertilizer strip planting, resulting in reduced yields. This should be taken as a lesson. (To be continued)

    我国农业机械化问题
    国家技术委员会主任　黄敬
    为什么我国农村人多地少，还需要机械化？
    我国农业增产的主要途径，是提高单位面积产量，开荒还在其次。提高单位面积产量的办法是：肥料、水利、精耕细作、复种、选种、高产作物、除虫、除害等，这些都是肯定的了；而对于农业的动力和工具的机械化问题，我们在认识上有过两度反复的变化。
    在1956年以前，我们只一般地认识到农业必须在社会改革的基础上进行技术改造，粗浅地了解了一些苏联和美国农业机械化的情况，笼统地认为机械化可以提高劳动生产率，可以增产，是农业技术改造的一个主要方向。虽然也考虑到我国条件不足，要从畜力农具逐步过渡到机械化；可是，我们没有很好地研究我国农村的具体情况，只是拿外国的农业机械的定额来推算。因此，在农业机械的长远规划上，水平偏高，进度偏急；规划的品种太少，而且是照抄国外的产品。
    1956年的建设高潮，较量了我们的国力，使我们认识到在这样一个“一穷二白”、人口众多的大国里建设社会主义的复杂性和艰巨性，我们开始考虑到我国农业人多地少这个根本特点的问题。苏联和美国都是地广人稀的国家，农业的劳动力缺乏，用机械化代替人力，提高劳动生产率，以扩大耕地，获得了很显著的增产效果，积累也比较快。我国的特点和他们不同，国土虽然很大，但耕地不多，可开垦的荒地也不多，而人口比较多，在这地少人多的情况下，农业增产必须采取精耕细作等比较复杂的途径；同时，外国的农业机械，大多适宜于平原旱地和大块土地的耕作，而且多半是用石油作燃料，而我国由于丘陵多、水田多、田面小、石油缺等自然和资源特点，对农业机械的要求也比较复杂。在平原旱地推行外国机械还比较接近，但不是在所有地区都能适用。这些，说明我国的农业技术改造，在吸取国外先进经验时，必须结合我国的特点，也就是说，应当有自己的道路。我们学习了中央的指示，明确了农业技术改造必须适合中国农情，稳步前进，并以提高单位面积产量为重点的方针。可是，在这一时期，我们对于农业机械化的速度和范围，又有一些片面的看法：把提高单位面积产量的方针和机械化对立起来，认为农业机械化的效果既然主要是提高劳动生产率，对提高单位面积产量就不会有什么显著的效果；在人力不足的地区机械化固然是需要的，在人多地少的地区，除了水利排灌必须用一部分机械以外，在耕种和收获上推行机械化，只会引起人力的过剩，对增产没有多大的好处，反而要耗费很多的投资；再则石油问题也还没有解决。因此，当时我们认为我国农业机械化的进度只能是缓慢的，它实施的范围也只能是很有限度的。这些看法，好像是结合了中国的实际情况，实际上认识还是模糊的，对农村的实际情况，特别是合作化以后的发展趋势并没有进行深入的调查研究。
    最近，我们组织了一批干部和技术人员下乡调查，并和农林水利部门进一步交换了意见，开始了解到农村的一些具体情况，这些情况和我们在北京所想像的大有出入；毛主席对于农业机械化的指示，更使我们明确了对于这个问题的认识，说明我们过去的认识是错误的。农业合作化以后，农业和副业生产的发展，使农村的情况有了很大的变化，农忙时，劳动力不足已成为普遍的问题，就是在人口最稠密的地区，经营较好的合作社，在农忙时节，人畜力也出现了严重不足的情况，障碍着各种增产措施的推行。因此，需要使用机械来解除人畜力不足的困难。而且机械化只要运用得当，增加单位面积产量也比畜力农具的效果高（耕得深，播得匀，动作快，能够抢农时）；如果经营得好，成本也可以比较人畜力低廉。因此，农业机械化仍然有必要按照不同的经济和技术情况，有步骤、有重点地积极推行，而不需要等待到相当长时间以后。所谓有步骤、有重点地积极推行，就是要依据农业合作化以后的经济发展的程度，对机械设备需要的逐步增长，分别需要的轻重缓急，不同地区的特点，农村购买和工厂生产这些机械的可能等具体情况，权衡推行中的经济得失，来积极有步骤地推行农业的机械化，而不是抱着消极等待的态度，慢吞吞地来解决。根据我们初步了解，引起目前农村对机械化的需要，主要有以下一些原因：
    第一、由于复种指数提高，投入土地的劳动量大大增加。华北平原，耕地平均是每人三亩左右，华东、西南是两亩左右，华南则在两亩以下，这些地区都算是人多地少的地区。人虽然多，但是，季节性的忙闲不均问题仍然严重。我国大部分地区，无霜期都较长，可以复种。一提倡复种，农忙时节就更忙起来了。例如在华北平原，要把一熟改双熟，一年最忙的时间集中在六十天左右（从割麦到种秋二十天，秋收到种麦四十天）。这个时候，又收又种，还要灌溉，加上牲口缺乏，人力还要代替畜力，人力就更不够了。长江流域无霜期是二百五十天左右，适合稻的生长气候的天数还要少一些，而双季稻的生长期一共大约要二百一、二十天左右，其间交替的空隙只有几天或十几、二十天，收、耕、耙、施肥、插秧都挤在这几天，非常紧张。农民说，要把双季稻种好，最好能做到“早黄晚青”（即上午割早稻，晚上插上晚稻秧）。不少地区因为忙不过来，可以复种的也只好不复种，或者错过了时间，晚稻熟不了，或者只好把晚稻粗种，因而减收。华南、西南的无霜期虽然更长一些，但是，有条件争取种三季，劳动力的紧张，并没有减轻。所以，现在限制着复种指数的增加，主要就是由于人畜力缺乏的缘故（也还有肥料缺乏的原因）。因此，现在南方劳动力的不足情形，甚至比人口较疏的北方反而更严重。农民形容农忙时节，说简直是“要粮不要命”。
    第二、各种水利措施，使农业的劳动量也大大地增加了。特别在华北平原，灌溉是一个很大的问题，如果搞好了，能收到极大的经济利益。河南新乡专区辉县孟庄南李村就是一个例子。他们在干旱地区开发水源（打井、开渠），增施肥料，改进栽培方法，割麦前用养稻苗方法育谷苗，割麦后灌水栽谷秧，收谷后种白菜、萝卜，菜熟后再种小麦，因此，他们那里有不少每亩年产千斤粮、万斤菜的田地。他们增产的关键，就在于灌溉，使旱田变水田，一季改多季，实行了“三肥五水”（施三次肥，上五次水），精耕细作。新乡专区对于其它类型的土地，也采取了不同的水利措施：洼区搞水田水作，麦稻轮作；在内涝区，把不能排泄的雨水层层围住，使它就地蒸发和渗透，不使内涝，他们把这叫做：对水实行“限制、利用、改造”的办法；丘陵地带搞梯田、畦田、塘坝；盐碱地打深井，取甜水灌溉冲洗，并降低地下苦水水位，把盐碱地改造成好地。这些都是要花很大劳动量的。特别是用水较急的时候，恰好也是田间最忙的时候，再加上积肥、送粪、脱谷、铡草、推磨，都需要很多的人力、畜力。这样一来，人畜力就大大不够了。因此，他们迫切要求有机械动力来缓和他们人畜力的紧张情况，使人畜力能腾出来精耕细作，或经营果木以及其他副业。他们说，如果这些都弄好了，七、八分地就够养活一口人。
    生产的发展使畜力的需要增大，而牲口增殖很慢，有的地方甚至还减少了，因此，目前牲口的缺乏是普遍现象。牲口吃得多，一个大牲口大约顶三个大人，因此饲料就和粮食、经济作物、燃料争土地。饲料不足，牲畜的繁殖也就受到限制。许多地区已出现人拉犁、人推水车的情况。邢台专区隆尧等三个县，今春就有五万八千多人拉犁耕地，皖北这种情况也很普遍。这些情况就使某些地区对机械动力的需要更加迫切。
    第三、耕作愈来愈细致，副业也愈来愈多，因此人畜力也愈来愈不够。
    山东菏泽县有两个合作社，一个叫“六一社”，一个叫“八一社”。这两个社挨着，相距只六里。自然条件都差不多，每人平均耕地都是两亩半，也都是三十多亩地一头牲口，作物的情况也很相近。附近有个拖拉机站，但是这两个社对拖拉机耕地的态度却完全相反：六一社很反对用拖拉机耕地，社员说：拖拉机多干一亩地，就要抢我们一亩地的工分。他们向社主任说：你说机器耕得深，你说要多深，我们也可掘多深。八一社则相反，社员都积极要求机耕，他们说：机器要是不干，社员就不能多分。这两个社的自然条件都差不多，看法却完全相反，原因在哪里？
    第一，八一社要求机耕，是因为他们的田间管理工作多，精耕细作程度高。他们每亩地全年用二十四工，而六一社只用十八工。八一社的田间活（耙、犁、锄、治虫、追肥、底肥等），都比以前增加二倍多，所以每亩地产小麦二百一十三斤，而六一社只产一百四十斤。第二，八一社的副业开展多，他们有十三种副业（油坊、糖坊、粉坊、窑业、木器、铁业、缝纫、种畜、花工、马车、鸡房、草房、磨房等），在七百多劳动力中有一百一十四人、在一百一十八头牲口中有六十三头都兼作副业；而六一社虽有七、八种副业，但只有二十多个人参加。八一社没有人闲着，一个跛子、一个瞎子，也被安排到茶炉房拉风箱。他们没有劳动力过剩的问题，只感不足，所以他们要拖拉机。六一社则是人浮于事，和拖拉机站抢活干。下去调查的工作组总结出机耕的四个条件是：（1）社内的劳动力有安排、有出路（精耕细作，副业）；（2）社的经济底子较厚；（3）经营管理较好；（4）增产十分显著。
    由以上可以看出来，在农业社会主义改造以后，生产关系变了，生产力正在猛烈地向前发展着。对农业人口和农业机械化问题必须有新的看法。目前农村中的关键问题是忙闲不均的问题，所以今后农村富裕增产的关键，就在于农忙忙不过来的时候有机械来帮忙，使他们能够忙的过来；闲的时候，有副业可作，使他们闲不下来。这样才能把农民从忙闲不均的苦闷中解放出来，使各种增产的措施能够顺利地推行，农村的劳动生产率才能更快地增长上去。
    合作社只要经营管理得法，投到每亩地的劳动量，将是越来越多的。今后随着农业发展纲要的实施；合作社生产关系的日益完善；工业的发展，工业对农业的配合日益密切和加强；这种趋势的发展将越来越猛烈。改一季为多季、变旱田为水田、施肥、排灌水利、土地改造、精耕细作、除虫、除害以及发展副业生产等等，这一切都要投入越来越多的人力和畜力。因此，地虽然少，人虽然多，但可以做的事情和要做的事情更多，劳动力和畜力将越来越感觉不足。不足的劳动量，就迫切需要用机械动力和机械工具来代替，而人的劳动，就需要逐步转向那些比较需要技巧的、机器还不能代替的部分中去，因此机械和人力是相辅相成的。正确地逐步实施机械化对提高单位面积产量有着重大作用，这两者是可以也完全应该结合起来的。
    怎样根据农业生产的特点，来设计和使用农业机械？
    我国农业生产的特点，在地形方面，有水田、旱田、平原、山地、生荒、沼泽地、盐碱地等各种不同类型；在土壤上也是各不相同的；在耕作技术方面，有平作、垅作、间作、套作、畦作、穴肥、沟施肥等多种不同方法，种植的稀密和行距各地都不一致；在精耕细作和经营多样化方面我国农业有优良的传统；在作物方面，从热带到温带的作物，种类繁多，品种复杂；在气候方面，有的要抗旱保墒，有的要排水防涝，有的要在雨季收获，有的要抢冻冬耕；在动力资源方面，石油缺乏，牲畜大小悬殊，而且发展受到限制，亟需研究其他能源的利用；在农业经济方面，人工贱，农产品贱，农业积累少，而钢铁贵，机械贵，因此农村购买机器的能力有限；此外，农民还缺乏使用机器的经验，农村也缺乏一套为机械工具修配和服务机构。同时，由于农业机械化必须逐步发展，因此在新旧交替的过程中，还必须使人力、畜力与机力，机械化农具与旧式农具结合使用，结合不好就抵消机械化带来的好处。这些特点加在一起，形成了发展我国农业机械必须考虑的极其复杂的许多因素。因此，在农业机械的设计和使用上，必须采取以下几项原则：
    第一、机械化要与我国农业原有技术基础结合
    在最近几年内，我国农业机械虽然仍应以发展新式畜力农具为主，但机力农具是要逐年增多起来的。机器下乡必然产生一串的新旧矛盾问题，如主要作业机械化了，而其他作业还需要依靠人力、畜力；新的设备要与旧设备混合使用；新的设备与原有农艺方法要发生矛盾等等。例如，采用了机耕以后，送粪、翻耙还靠人工，一个快，一个慢，一个深，一个浅，组织得不好，反而弄不好。存在这种情形的地方，农民说：“机耕真够呛，越帮越忙”。又如排灌机械和土法打井有矛盾，土法打的井太浅，水量不够，几天就打光了；而且土井井眼太多，占地太多，把地分做一块块，这又和拖拉机的使用发生矛盾。新式的动力机用上以后，水车也配不上了，又要改装水泵。因此，推行农业机械要适应农业的原有技术基础，逐步提高。必须使机、畜相辅，新旧农具结合。几年来，农民群众在使用新式农具中，创造了不少好的经验。例如，利用十行播种机的架子装上除割刀和培土器，进行中耕培土；把双铧犁、播种机、收草机等大型畜力农具，改装为拖拉农具，能够机畜两用。今后设计农业机械就应当从这些方面来考虑。设计人员必须深入农村，同农艺学家、老农通力协作，总结农民的先进经验，创造适合我国农业特点的各种机械设备。生搬硬套的作法是注定要失败的。过去有些地方往往削足适履，不是使农具适合先进的耕作法，而是强使耕作法来适合农具，例如硬将垅作改成平作，将大豆玉米间作改成单作，将抓粪点种改成基肥条播等等，因而造成减产。这是应该引为教训的。　（未完）
