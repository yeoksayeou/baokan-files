We Can Certainly Convince Wavering Rich Middle Peasants
By our reporter Xiao Yan

　　After more than twenty days of mass debate in Butou Township, Changle County, Shandong Province, even the thirty-five rich middle peasant households who originally had more serious capitalist thoughts had successively recognized right and wrong and examined their erroneous ideas of wanting to take the old road. However, among the 119 rich middle peasant households in the township, there were still five whose thinking had not changed, who were still superficially compliant but unconvinced at heart, always thinking that they had suffered a loss by joining the cooperative, saying that today was no better than the past.

　　With the assistance of the county party committee work group, the township branch specifically analyzed the living and ideological situations of these individuals, identified the characteristics of each person, and believed that the political emancipation accounts should be laid out clearly, and the economic change accounts should also be thoroughly calculated. As long as the right medicine is prescribed to dig out the roots of their capitalist thoughts, they can certainly be debated into heartfelt submission.

　　Zhao Xueshu, a rich middle peasant in Zhao Fort Village, had a family of three. Last year, he reduced his grain income due to illness, and instead complained that collectivization was not good, saying things like: "The grain is all taken away by the state," "Joining the cooperative is not as good as working alone; the money distributed is not even enough for eye drops," "The supply and marketing cooperative doesn't even have enough white sugar to sell. What kind of society is this!"

　　During the debate, the household income account was first calculated for Zhao Xueshu. In 1947 (before liberation), a family of three farmed three *da mu* (each *da mu* equals 3.24 *shi mu*) of land, with a total annual income of 2,155 *jin*. After deducting 500 *jin* for land tax and 300 *jin* for feed, there were 1,355 *jin* remaining, an average of 451 *jin* of grain per person. Last year, he received 1,200 *jin* of grain, an average of 400 *jin* per person. The grain was slightly less, but he received 180 yuan in cash.

　　Poor peasant Zhao Fenglin said: "Last year, you were sick for a whole year and didn't do much labor, but your family received enough food and cash. If you were working alone, even being sick for half a year would have been hard on your family. In the 31st year of the Republic of China, when there was a flood, didn't you flee to Dalian, causing your wife and children to be scattered!" Poor peasant Zhao Zhisheng continued: "How could you withstand natural and man-made disasters by farming three *da mu* of land? Have you forgotten that there were more than forty households that fled, begged, and did odd jobs with you that year? The small peasant economy cannot withstand wind and rain! You clearly benefited from collectivization, but you speak ill of it!"

　　Zhao Xueshu was still not convinced and said in a low voice, "No matter what, it's still better for me to work alone. I can earn 200 yuan by planting half a *mu* of yellow tobacco. I can sell it or store it as I please. In the past, with money, you could have grain."

　　Poor peasant Zhao Tiaoyuan retorted, "You were sick for a year last year. If it were during the Kuomintang era, you would have been forced to sell all your possessions just to pay for labor service." Then he asked him, "How much does it cost to plant half a *mu* of yellow tobacco?" Zhao Xueshu replied, "It costs 50 yuan!" "Yes! After deducting the cost, you would only get 150 yuan. Last year, you received 180 yuan. Which is more? Besides, you were sick. Can the two women in your family both farm and plant yellow tobacco?" Poor peasant Zhao Youming continued, "The shortage of white sugar supply means that more sugar is produced, and even more people are eating sugar. Who in our village could often eat white sugar before liberation? How much do you, Zhao Xueshu, eat in a year? Don't be insatiable. Now you drink goat's milk every day, and you still want to drink it with sugar?" Under everyone's refutation, Zhao Xueshu was speechless.

　　In Beihe Village, Liu Chunshu, a rich middle peasant who was still unconvinced after two mass debates, was finally convinced at a forum attended by thirteen poor peasants and seven active middle peasant elements.

　　First, a detailed account of his family's income was calculated: Before liberation, seven people farmed ten *da mu* of land, and the total annual income, plus the exploitation income from hired labor, was 7,150 *jin* of grain. After deducting exorbitant taxes, seeds, and feed, only 2,670 *jin* remained. Each person averaged no more than 381 *jin*. After collectivization, the total income last year was 3,110 *jin*, 440 *jin* more than before liberation, and he also received 400 yuan in cash. This fundamentally refuted his erroneous argument that "past income was higher, and current income is lower."

　　Then, everyone further criticized Liu Chunshu's fallacy that "I didn't benefit from the Communist Party being here, and I didn't suffer from the Kuomintang being here."

　　Activist pointed out that the middle peasants all admitted that the Kuomintang era involved imposing donations and taxes, forced labor service and conscription, and a war-torn, frightened existence, while now it is a matter of peaceful and happy life in a peaceful world. They further questioned him, "Your three brothers are outside, one an officer and two cadres. You are a military family, but you say such things? How was your family during the Kuomintang era?" "Aren't officers and cadres all cultivated by the Communist Party and supported by the masses? Your family has produced so many cadres, and the village also looks up to you. What's wrong with the new society? Taking the lead to withdraw from the cooperative and wanting to go back to working alone is smearing your brothers' faces!"

　　Poor peasants Liu Ruhai and Sun Tianjun, and middle peasants Zhao Shixiu and Zhao Guangwu, all used their own experiences and presented the facts of improved living conditions after collectivization to criticize him.

　　In the face of the facts, Liu Chunshu admitted that living conditions had indeed improved. He said, "I only considered my own small calculations, and always felt that I had suffered a loss by joining the cooperative. In the past, I only looked at the gross income. Six or seven thousand *jin* of grain piled up in large granaries, full granaries, and looked like a lot, but I never calculated the net income account. There were seven people before, and now there are eighteen. If it weren't for collectivization, the land would still be the same, and the population has grown so much. Not to mention dividing money, there wouldn't even be enough to eat." Poor peasant Liu Chengxi questioned him, "Since life is better than in the past, why do you still say that the Kuomintang didn't hurt you, and the Communist Party didn't benefit you?" He further examined himself: "After liberation, I wanted to get rich through exploitation and live a decent life; once collectivization started, that road was blocked. I felt that it was not as free as working alone, so I spoke ill of collectivization. I have capitalist thoughts and have taken the wrong path!"

　　Back in the team, Liu Chunshu also took the initiative to examine his mistake of wanting to take the capitalist road in a general meeting, and expressed his willingness to sell fifty more *jin* of surplus grain. In his own team (he is the deputy team leader), he led the formulation of the team's production plan and persuaded his father (over fifty years old), who had not worked hard for more than two years, to go to work. In recent days, their brigade's thirty-five laborers have consistently maintained perfect attendance.

　　Zhao Lefu, a rich middle peasant in Zhao Fort Village, Yao Zhende, a rich middle peasant in Liang Village, and Li Wanlu, a rich middle peasant in Chang Village, have all spread erroneous remarks in their villages. Some wanted to engage in speculation and did not work properly in the cooperative; others were greedy for enjoyment and nostalgic for the landlord's life. However, in the face of facts and truth, they finally became heartfully convinced!

　　一定能说服动摇的富裕中农
　　本报记者　萧彦
    山东省昌乐县埠头乡经过二十多天的全民大辩论，连原来资本主义思想比较严重的三十五户富裕中农，也先后认清了是非，检讨了自己想走老路的错误思想。可是，在全乡的一百一十九户富裕中农中，却还有五户思想没有转变，还是口服心不服，总认为自己入社吃了亏，说什么今天并不比过去强。
    乡支部在县委工作组的协助下，具体地分析了这几个人的生活和思想情况，找出了他们每个人的特点，认为政治翻身账要摆开，经济变化账也要算透。只要对症下药，挖到他们资本主义思想的根子，一定可以辩得他们口服心服。
    赵堡村的富裕中农赵学书，家有三口人，去年他因生病减少了粮食收入，反而埋怨合作化不好，说什么：“粮食都叫国家拿去了”、“入社不如单干，分的钱还不够点眼药的”、“供销社白糖都不够卖，这是什么社会！”
    辩论时，先给赵学书算了家庭收入账。1947年（解放前）三口人种三大亩（每大亩合三点二四市亩）地，全年收入二千一百五十五斤，除了田税五百斤，饲料三百斤，余一千三百五十五斤，每人平均四百五十一斤粮；去年他分粮一千二百斤，每人平均四百斤，粮食少了一些，现款却收入了一百八十元。
    贫农赵凤林说：“去年你生了一年病，没怎么劳动，家里分足了口粮，还分到了现款，你若单干，就是生上半年病，家里也够受的。民国三十一年遇涝灾，你还不是逃荒到大连，弄得妻离子散！”贫农赵志盛接着说：“你种三大亩地怎能顶住天灾人祸？你忘了那年和你同时出外逃荒、要饭、打短工的就有四十多户？小农经济经不起风吹雨打！你明明得了合作化的好处，反说合作化的坏话！”
    赵学书还不服，低声说：“管怎么也不如我自家单干强，种上半亩黄烟也收二百元，爱卖就卖，爱存就存；早先有钱就能有粮食。”
    贫农赵调元反驳他：“你去年生了一年病，若是国民党时候，光出夫就得逼你倾家荡产。”接着问他：“你想种半亩黄烟多少成本？”赵学书答：“得五十元！”、“是啊！除去成本，也不过得一百五十元。你去年却分到一百八十元，那项多？再说，你病了，你家里两个妇女能又种地又种黄烟吗？”贫农赵有明接着说：“白糖不够供应，是糖产多了，吃糖的人更多了。咱村解放前谁家能常吃上白糖？你赵学书一年吃多少？别不知足，现在你天天喝羊奶，还尽想喝放糖的？”在大家的驳斥下，赵学书无言可答了。
    在北河村，经过两次群众大辩论还是心不服的富裕中农刘春书，在又召开了一次有十三个贫农和七个中农积极分子参加的座谈会上，终于服气了。
    先给他家算了细账：解放前七口人种十大亩地，全年总收入加上雇工剥削所得共七千一百五十斤粮。除去苛捐杂税、种子饲料只剩二千六百七十斤。每人平均不过三百八十一斤。合作化后，去年总收入共三千一百一十斤，比解放前多了四百四十斤，还分了四百元现款。这就从根本上驳倒了他“过去收入多，现在收入少”的错误论点。
    接着，大家针对着刘春书说的“共产党在这我也没得好处，国民党在这我也没吃亏”的谬论，进一步批驳他。
    积极分子指出那个中农也都承认国民党时代派捐逼税、出夫抓丁，兵荒马乱，担惊受怕，现在却是安居乐业天下太平的事实。进一步质问他：“你家弟兄三个在外，一个军官，两个干部，你是军属，却说出这种话来？国民党时候，你家里怎么样？”“军官、干部还不都是共产党培养，群众支持的？你家出了这么些干部，村里也都看得起你，新社会那点不好？带头出合作社，想回头单干，不是给你兄弟们脸上摸灰？”
    贫农刘汝淮、孙田俊，中农赵世修、赵光武都现身说法，摆出合作化后生活改善的事实批驳他。
    在事实面前，刘春书承认了生活确有改善，他说：“我光打自家的小算盘，总觉着入社吃了亏似的，过去光看毛收入，六、七千斤粮堆得大囤满，小囤尖，看起来蛮多，可是并没算过净收入的账。以前七口人，现在十八口。要不是合作化了，土地还是那些，人口增长这么多，别说分钱，光吃粮也不够。”贫农刘承溪质问他：“既然生活比过去好了，为什么还说国民党在你没吃亏，共产党来了你没沾光？”他又进一步检讨：“解放以后，本想靠剥削发家致富，过个体面生活；一搞合作化，那条路不通了，觉着不如单干自由，才说合作化的坏话。我是资本主义思想，走了错误道路！”
    回到队里，刘春书又主动地在大会上向大家检讨了想走资本主义道路的错误，并表示自己要多卖五十斤余粮。在自己的小队里（他是副小队长）领导订出了全队生产计划，又回家把两年多没大干活的父亲（五十多岁）也说服下地干活了。前些日子他们大队三十五个劳动力一直保持着全勤。
    赵埠村的富裕中农赵乐福、梁庄村的富裕中农姚振德、常庄村富裕中农李万禄在村里都散布过错误言论。有的想搞投机活动，不好好在社里劳动；有的贪图享受、留恋地主生活。但是，他们在事实和真理的面前，终于心服口服了！
