    Three Large Yellow Eggs
    In mid-August, at Yang Luting's home in the Fourth Farm of the Huaibei Salt Field, a hen weighing over two catties laid a large egg weighing five taels and six qian, with three yolks inside. In early September, this hen laid another egg of the same size, also with three yolks.
    According to Yang Luting, this hen usually lays eggs that are larger than those of other hens, and they are often double-yolked.

    三个黄的大鸡蛋
    8月中旬，淮北盐场四场杨露庭家，有一只二斤多重的母鸡，生了一个五两六钱重的大蛋，蛋中有三个蛋黄。9月初这只鸡又生了一个同样大的蛋，也是三个蛋黄。
    据杨露庭说，这只鸡平常生的蛋就比别的母鸡的蛋大些，而且经常是一蛋双黄。  （石镜）
