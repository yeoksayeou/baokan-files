Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 10th:
　　Foreign Minister Nan Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on October 9th, protesting and condemning the U.S. military's atrocities in South Korea, including murder and assault. This statement has been sent to foreign diplomatic envoys and journalists stationed in Korea.

　　The statement said that the Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed and implemented in Korea for a long time, but the U.S. invading troops continue to occupy South Korea and constantly inflict intolerable atrocities on the South Korean people. Since the "United Nations Command" moved to Seoul this year, and especially since the U.S. side has blatantly violated the Armistice Agreement in order to transport new weapons into South Korea, the atrocities of the U.S. military have become even more cruel and frequent.

　　The statement said that the U.S. military's atrocities in South Korea, especially their bestial behavior towards women and children, are unparalleled in their inhumanity and frequency anywhere else in the world. All the Korean people are currently firmly opposing and condemning these atrocities of U.S. imperialism.

　　The statement pointed out that the only way for the South Korean people to escape their current tragic situation is to have the U.S. military withdraw from Korea and peacefully reunify the motherland.

　　The statement said that national contempt, insults, and atrocities inflicted by the U.S. invading troops on the South Korean brothers and sisters cannot be tolerated or remained silent about. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea strongly demands that the U.S. military immediately cease such atrocities. The Government of the Republic and the entire Korean people, with surging feelings of national indignation, resolutely protest and denounce the barbaric crimes of the U.S. military against their South Korean compatriots, and strongly demand that the butcher group—the U.S. military—withdraw from South Korea and punish the criminals.

　　The statement said that the Government of the Republic emphasizes that the United Nations should take note of the fact that the American aggression in Korea and the atrocities of the U.S. military against the South Korean people are being carried out under the banner of the United Nations.

　　The statement said that the Government of the Republic believes that in order to promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, an international conference with broad participation of relevant countries should be convened promptly.

　　The statement concluded by saying that no matter how vicious the American aggressors carry out atrocities and suppress, the Korean people's indomitable fighting spirit for the peaceful reunification of the motherland cannot be thwarted.

    据新华社平壤10日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日10月9日发表声明，抗议和斥责美军在南朝鲜杀人、行凶等暴行。这项声明已经发给驻朝鲜的各国外交使节和记者。
    声明说，朝鲜停战协定签订和在朝鲜实施已经很久了，但是，美国侵略军队继续强占着南朝鲜，并且对南朝鲜人民不断施行不能容忍的暴行。今年以来，特别从“联合国军”司令部搬到汉城和美方为了把新武器运入南朝鲜而粗暴地破坏停战协定以来，美军的暴行更加残忍和层出不穷。
    声明说，美军在南朝鲜的暴行，特别是对妇女和儿童的兽性行为，其惨无人道和频繁是世界上其它地方所没有的。全体朝鲜人民目前正在坚决反对和谴责美帝国主义的这种暴行。
    声明指出，南朝鲜人民摆脱目前悲惨处境的唯一途径是使美军撤出朝鲜，和平统一祖国。
    声明说，对于美国侵略军队加于南朝鲜兄弟姊妹的民族蔑视、侮辱和暴行绝不能容忍和沉默，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府强硬要求美军立即停止这种暴行。共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民怀着澎湃的民族愤慨情绪，坚决抗议和痛斥美军对南朝鲜同胞的野蛮罪行，强硬主张刽子手集团——美军撤出南朝鲜和惩办罪犯。
    声明说，共和国政府强调：联合国应该注意到这一事实，美国在朝鲜的侵略和美军对南朝鲜人民的暴行是打着联合国的招牌进行的。
    声明说，共和国政府认为，为了促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，应该迅速召开有关国家广泛参加的国际会议。
    声明最后说，不论美国侵略者遂行怎样凶恶的暴行和镇压，为祖国的和平统一而斗争的朝鲜人民不屈的斗志是挫折不了的。
