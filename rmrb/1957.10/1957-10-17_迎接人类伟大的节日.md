The University of Bucharest held a report meeting on "The Brilliant Achievements of Soviet Science and Culture in the Past Forty Years." Stalin City held an exhibition of "Lenin's Life" and "Leningrad - the Cradle of the Great October Socialist Revolution." Various clubs, cultural palaces, and schools in the Galati region have held meetings with Romanians who participated in the October Revolution and the Soviet Civil War. Cinemas across the country have begun showing Soviet films such as "Battleship Potemkin." At a meeting of former Red Guards and underground workers held in the Targu Mures region, Fazekas, secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, spoke, pointing out the world-historical significance of the October Revolution. Mihali and others who participated in the Red Guards recalled the struggles against the White Guards and counter-revolutionary bandits in the young Soviet Republic.
    Presidium of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Association Issues Appeal
    In order to welcome the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Presidium of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Association in Hungary issued an appeal to all activists and supporters of the association, saying that we Hungarians have many reasons to celebrate this day with the heroic people of the Soviet Union with gratitude and sincere friendship.
    A grand opening ceremony of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Museum was held here a few days ago. Hungarian First Deputy Prime Minister Münnich, National Assembly Speaker Rónai, and others attended the opening ceremony. At the opening ceremony, the Presidium of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Association awarded honorary medals of the association to a group of veteran members of the Soviet Communist Party who are visiting Hungary.
    Poland Establishes Celebration Committee
    The National Committee for Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Poland has been established in Warsaw. The members of the committee include Gomulka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, as well as leaders of other political parties, scientists, writers, trade union workers, journalists, representatives of youth organizations, and participants in the October Revolution.
    Albanian Youth Launch Labor Competition
    To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, the Albanian Labor Youth League launched a labor competition among rural youth and proposed designating November as a "Marching Month." The Labor Youth League called on young men and women in rural areas to complete the 1957 production plan in the last three months of this year. The winning regions of the labor competition will receive a winning banner and material rewards. For half a year, youth in various parts of Albania have launched competitions. Many outstanding groups have emerged in factories, rural areas, and construction sites.
    Hirano Yoshitaro Praises Soviet Peace Policy
    In order to welcome the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, the Japanese "Akahata" published an article by Hirano Yoshitaro, chairman of the Japanese Peace Committee, entitled "Socialism and Peace." The article said that the Soviet Union has consistently implemented the peace policy proclaimed by the Peace Decree of November 1917. The author wrote that the people of Asia clearly understand this.
    Hirano Yoshitaro went on to point out that after World War II, socialism went beyond the scope of one country and became a world system. He also emphasized that the socialist camp has now become a powerful force capable of preventing US imperialism from launching a new war.
    Referring to the so-called "position of strength" policy pursued by the US aggressive bloc, the author said that in the current situation where the socialist camp stands tall and the socialist countries are developing rapidly, this policy is on the verge of bankruptcy. More and more countries in Asia and Europe feel that the US establishment of military blocs threatens their independence and are gradually turning to the path of neutrality.
    Hirano Yoshitaro said that in this situation, the Soviet Union's proposal submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion on peaceful coexistence has great significance.

    为了迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年，匈牙利的匈苏友好协会主席团向协会的所有积极分子和拥护者发出号召书说，我们匈牙利人有许多理由应该怀着感激和真诚友好的感情来同苏联的英勇人民一道庆祝这个日子。
    前几天，这里的匈苏友谊馆举行了隆重的开幕式。匈牙利第一副总理明尼赫、国民议会议长罗奈伊等都参加了开幕式。匈苏友好协会主席团在开幕式上授给了正在匈牙利访问的苏联共产党一批老党员以协会的荣誉纪念章。
    波兰成立庆祝委员会
    波兰全国庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年委员会已经在华沙成立。委员会的成员包括波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡和统一工人党中央政治局委员们，还包括其他政党的领导人、科学家、作家、工会工作者、记者、青年组织的代表和十月革命的参加者。
    阿尔巴尼亚青年开展劳动竞赛
    为庆祝伟大的十月革命四十周年，阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟在农村青年中发起了劳动竞赛，并提出把11月作为“进军月”的号召。劳动青年联盟号召农村男女青年在今年最后的三个月中完成1957年的生产计划。劳动竞赛的优胜地区将获得优胜奖旗和物质奖励。半年以来，阿尔巴尼亚各地青年就纷纷展开了竞赛。在工厂、农村和建设工地上都出现了不少的优秀小组。
    平野义太郎歌颂苏联和平政策
    日本“赤旗报”为了迎接伟大的十月革命四十周年纪念登载了日本和平委员会主席平野义太郎的一篇题目是“社会主义与和平”的文章。文章说，苏联始终如一地执行1917年11月和平法令所宣告的和平政策。作者写道，亚洲人民清楚地了解这一点。
    平野义太郎接着指出，第二次世界大战以后，社会主义越出了一国的范围，变成为世界体系。他同时强调指出，现在社会主义阵营成了一股强大的力量，能够制止美帝国主义发动新战争的企图。
    作者在谈到美国侵略集团奉行的所谓“实力地位”政策时说，在目前社会主义阵营巍然屹立，社会主义国家飞速进步的情况下，这种政策眼看就要破产。亚洲和欧洲越来越多的国家感到美国建立军事集团威胁它们的独立，而逐渐转到中立的道路上来。
    平野义太郎说，在这种局势下，苏联提交联合国大会讨论的关于和平共处的建议具有重大的意义。　　　　　　　（新华社）
