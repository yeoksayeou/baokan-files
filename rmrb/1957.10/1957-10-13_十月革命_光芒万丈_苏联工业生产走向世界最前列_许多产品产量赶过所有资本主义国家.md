Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th: This year, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union will increase to thirty-three times that of 1913, of which the production of means of production will increase to seventy-four times. Statistical data show that the Soviet Union, a world industrial power, has not only long surpassed the most advanced capitalist countries in Europe—Britain, France, and West Germany—in terms of total industrial output, ranking second in the world, but also the output of many of its most important industrial products is now almost equal to the total output of similar products in these three countries combined. At the same time, it is rapidly approaching and catching up with the United States, moving towards the world's top position.

In the forty years since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union's industrial development speed has been more than ten to twenty times faster than that of advanced capitalist countries. During the pre-war five-year plan period starting in 1928, the Soviet Union built and put into production more than 9,000 new large-scale state industrial enterprises, established dozens of industrial sectors that did not exist before the revolution, and began to rationally allocate national industrial production, thereby greatly boosting industrial production. Before the revolution, the backward Russian industrial production accounted for less than one-fourteenth of the United States' industrial output, one-fifth of Germany's, and one-quarter of Britain's. At this time, after only twenty years (including nine years of war and restoring the national economy), the Soviet Union's industrial production level caught up with and surpassed Germany, Britain, and France, jumping from fifth place in the world to second place. Among various industrial sectors, the production of important industrial sectors such as machine manufacturing, electricity, coal, pig iron, steel, and cement, which were backward in the past, also jumped to second, third, and fourth place in the world respectively; the output of new industrial sectors established after the revolution, such as combine harvester manufacturing, automobile, tractor manufacturing, and aluminum production, also ranked among the top in the world. Such a rapid leap is unprecedented in capitalist countries.

During the post-war five-year plan period, Soviet industrial production experienced even faster development. New industrial centers continue to emerge throughout the country, and tens of thousands of new industrial enterprises have been built and put into production. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union began to catch up with or surpass all advanced capitalist countries in the world, not only in terms of the speed of industrial output increase but also in terms of the absolute output increase of many important products. Currently, with the exception of the automobile industry and the petroleum industry, the output of the most important industrial sectors such as electricity, steel, pig iron, machinery, tractors, coal, cement, and aluminum is second only to the United States and ranks second in the world, while the output of combine harvesters ranks first in the world.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, Soviet industrial production will make great strides in further approaching and rapidly catching up with the United States. In the first year of this five-year plan, the growth rate of the Soviet Union's total industrial output was more than three times that of Western European capitalist countries and more than four times that of the United States. In the first eight months of this year, Soviet industrial production increased by more than 10% compared to the same period last year, while US industrial production increased by only 1.4% during the same period. According to Moscow newspapers, the total timber harvesting volume of the Soviet timber industry has now exceeded that of the United States and jumped to first place in the world, and the country's coal output is estimated to have caught up with the United States and will soon occupy the top position in the world. By the end of this five-year plan in 1960, the total number of machine tools in the Soviet Union will be equal to the total number of machine tools currently possessed by the United States, or equal to the total number of existing machine tools in Britain, France, and West Germany. The Soviet Union's cement output will reach 52 million tons by 1960; before 1965, it will be able to catch up with and surpass the United States in this regard and become the country with the highest cement production in the world.

In terms of other industrial products, the Soviet Union will also catch up with and surpass the United States in the shortest historical period. This is because not only has the Soviet Union's industrial production speed always been faster than that of the United States, but also its distance from the United States in terms of industrial output is constantly and rapidly narrowing year by year. Experts believe that if the Second World War had not interrupted the development of Soviet industry and brought serious losses to it, then, according to the current development speed, the Soviet Union could have reached the current level of the United States in terms of total industrial output during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, and even surpassed the current level of the United States in the output of some of the most important products.

### 十月革命　光芒万丈  苏联工业生产走向世界最前列  许多产品产量赶过所有资本主义国家

　　十月革命　光芒万丈
    苏联工业生产走向世界最前列
    许多产品产量赶过所有资本主义国家
    据新华社莫斯科12日电　今年苏联工业总产量将增加为1913年的三十三倍，其中生产资料生产将增加为七十四倍。统计材料表明，苏联这个世界工业强国不仅在工业总产量方面早已超过欧洲最先进的资本主义国家——英国、法国和西德——而居世界第二位，而且它的许多最重要的工业产品的产量现在已经差不多分别等于这三个国家同类产品产量的总和，同时还正在迅速接近和赶上美国，向世界第一位前进。
    十月革命后四十年来，苏联的工业发展速度比先进的资本主义国家快十多倍到二十倍以上。在从1928年开始的战前五年计划的年代里，苏联建成了九千多个新的大规模的国家工业企业并投入生产，建立了几十个革命前所没有的工业部门，并且开始合理地配置了全国的工业生产，从而使工业生产获得了巨大的高涨。革命以前，落后的俄国工业生产还占不到美国工业产量的十四分之一、德国的五分之一和英国的四分之一，而这时仅仅经过二十年（包括战争和恢复国民经济的九年在内），苏联的工业生产水平就赶上和超过了德国、英国和法国，而从过去占世界第五位跃居第二位。在各个工业部门中，过去落后的机器制造、电力、煤、生铁、钢、水泥等重要工业部门的生产也分别跃居世界第二、第三和第四位；革命后才建立起来的联合机制造、汽车、拖拉机制造、制铝等新工业部门的产量，这时也列入世界的前几位。这样快的跃进是资本主义国家的工业所没有的。
    战后五年计划期间，苏联工业生产获得了更快的发展。新的工业中心不断在全国各地出现，成万的新工业企业建成和投入生产。在第五个五年计划期间苏联不仅在工业的增产速度上，而且在许多重要产品的绝对增产量上，都已经开始赶上或超过世界上所有的先进资本主义国家了。现在，除汽车工业和石油工业以外，最重要的工业部门的产品如电力、钢、生铁、机器、拖拉机、煤、水泥、铝等的产量都仅次于美国而居世界第二位，而联合机的产量则居于世界第一位。
    在第六个五年计划期间，苏联工业生产将在进一步接近和迅速赶上美国方面大大前进一步。在这个五年计划头一年，苏联工业总产量的增长速度等于西欧各资本主义国家的三倍多和美国的四倍多。在今年头八个月里，苏联工业生产又比去年同时期增加了10％以上，而同时期美国工业生产仅仅增加了1.4％。据莫斯科报刊报道，苏联木材工业的木材采伐总量现在已超过美国而跃居世界第一位，全国煤产量据估计也已赶上美国而在不久以后就可以占世界首位了。到这个五年计划结束的1960年，苏联的机床的总数就将等于现在美国所拥有的机床的总数，或者等于英、法、西德三国现有机床数目的总和。苏联的水泥产量到1960年将达到五千二百万吨；在1965年以前，它就可以在这方面赶上和超过美国而成为世界上生产水泥最多的国家。
    在其他工业产品方面，苏联在最短的历史时期内也将赶上和超过美国。因为，不但苏联的工业生产速度一直比美国快，而且它同美国在工业产量方面的距离也年年都在不断地迅速缩小。专家认为，如果不是由于第二次世界大战一度中断了苏联工业的发展和给它带来了严重的损失，那么，按照现有的发展速度看，苏联在第六个五年计划期间本来就可以在工业生产总产量方面达到美国现有的水平，而在一些最重要的产品的产量方面还要超过美国现有的水平。
