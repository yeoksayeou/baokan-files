　　Cherish Every Fraction of Cultivated Land
    Shaanxi Many Agricultural Cooperatives in Shaanxi Pay Attention to Restoring and Utilizing Abandoned Cultivated Land
    (Our Dispatch) In order to increase grain production, many counties and districts in Shaanxi Province are actively inspecting and restoring abandoned cultivated land.
    After agricultural cooperativization in Shaanxi Province, some cultivated land increased due to the consolidation of land plots and the elimination of field boundaries. However, many cooperative cadres and members believed that after cooperativization, their assets had increased, and in order to facilitate production and implement the "three guarantees" system of guaranteed workload, guaranteed output, and guaranteed cost, they abandoned a large number of cultivated lands located on the edges of fields, roadsides, corners of fields, and near graves. For example, a recent survey of 22 agricultural cooperatives in Beipai and Shide Townships in Liquan County revealed that more than 740 mu of such land had been abandoned. Many agricultural cooperatives also blindly occupied too much cultivated land for the construction of livestock sheds, warehouses, etc. Some areas also occupied some land due to the construction of reservoirs, the opening of new canals, the widening of roads, and the retention of fixed yards. According to key investigations in Chang'an and other counties, such barren and abandoned small plots of land generally account for more than 2% of the cultivated land area. These abandoned lands may be small for a single agricultural cooperative, but if calculated based on the entire province, approximately more than 1.3 million mu of land will be left uncultivated each year, reducing grain production by at least 400 million jin annually.
    Currently, the leadership of each county has begun to pay attention to this issue and is educating farmers, clarifying the serious losses of abandoning small plots of land to the country and the farmers themselves. For example, Chang'an County recently presented an account to the farmers, stating that the county had abandoned approximately more than 14,000 mu of small plots of land, and if calculated based on an annual yield of 300 jin per mu, the county would harvest 4.4 million jin less grain per year. The county leadership also issued a call at the county's meeting of cooperative directors and accountants, urging them to "strive to restore all abandoned cultivated land and not waste a single fraction of land."
    Currently, many agricultural cooperatives have begun to pay attention to the issue of abandoned cultivated land and are trying their best to cultivate these lands. For example, Hongmiao District in Nanzheng County has already planted soybeans, small beans, and other crops on more than 5,100 mu of abandoned land. Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Duli Township, Sanyuan County, had more than 100 mu of riverside land, which farmers used to plant wheat, rapeseed, and other crops before joining the cooperative. After cooperativization, some people believed that riverside land was labor-intensive and produced less grain, so they abandoned it. Recently, this cooperative mobilized more than 100 members to deep-plow this land in preparation for sowing winter wheat, estimating that it can harvest 20,000 jin of grain.

　　珍惜一分一厘的耕地
    陕西许多农业社注意恢复利用弃耕土地
    本报讯　陕西省许多县、区为了增加粮食产量，正在积极检查和恢复弃耕土地。
    陕西省在农业合作化以后，由于土地连片，消除了地畔地界，增加了一些耕地。但是，也有许多社干部和社员认为合作化以后家当大了，为了便利生产和实行包工包产包费用的“三包”制度，就把大批位于场边、路边、地角、坟边的耕地都丢弃了。如醴泉县北牌、史德两乡最近调查了二十二个农业社，就荒弃了这样土地七百四十多亩。还有很多农业社为了建设畜棚、仓库等，而盲目地过多地占用了耕地。有些地区因为兴修水库、新开渠道、加宽道路、留固定场面等，也或多或少占用了一些土地。据长安等县的重点调查，这样荒芜和废弃的小块土地，一般都占到耕地面积的2％以上。这些被弃耕的土地对一个农业社来说，是一星半点，如果按全省推算，每年大约要少种一百三十多万亩土地，每年至少减少四亿多斤粮食。
    目前，各县领导上已经开始重视这个问题，并向农民进行教育，讲清弃耕小块土地对国家和农民本身的严重损失。如长安县最近曾向农民算了一笔账，全县弃耕小块土地约有一万四千多亩，如果按每亩田年产量三百斤计算，全县一年就少收四百四十多万斤粮食；县领导机关并在全县社主任和会计会议上，提出了“争取弃耕土地全部恢复耕种，不浪费一分一厘土地”的号召。
    现在，很多农业社已开始注意弃耕土地的问题，想尽办法垦耕这些土地。如南郑县红庙区已经有五千一百多亩弃耕地种上了黄豆、小豆等庄稼。三原县独李乡新华农业社有一百多亩河亭地，入社前农民都是用来种植麦子、菜籽等作物的；合作化后有些人认为河亭地费工、打粮食少，就把它荒弃了。最近这个合作社动员了一百多社员对这块地进行了深翻，准备播种冬麦，估计可收二万斤粮食。
