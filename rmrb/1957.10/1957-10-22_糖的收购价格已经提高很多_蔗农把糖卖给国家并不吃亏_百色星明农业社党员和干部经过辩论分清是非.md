Reported by our newspaper: The Xingming Agricultural Cooperative in Luosuo Township, Baise County, Guangxi, is a cooperative mainly engaged in the production of the economic crop—sugarcane. In the past, some members of this cooperative and township and cooperative cadres always believed that "the price of selling sugar to the sugar company is too low and not worthwhile," and were unwilling to sell sugar to the state. In order to clarify the major issues of right and wrong, the cooperative conducted a major debate on the issue of national sugar purchases among party members and key township and cooperative cadres.

During the debate, everyone compared prices before and after liberation. Before liberation, the higher sugar price was "one catty of sugar for one catty of rice," and generally one hundred catties of sugar could be exchanged for eighty to ninety catties of rice. After liberation, the sugar price has been stable, and this year it has even increased compared to last year. In the past, every hundred catties of high-quality sheet sugar was more than fourteen yuan, but this year it has increased to more than sixteen yuan; the sugar produced by the cooperative is of good quality, and the upper and middle grades account for the majority. Averaging it out, the selling price per hundred catties can be more than fifteen yuan, which can buy back more than one hundred and fifty catties of rice. After such calculations and comparisons, everyone unanimously admitted: "Compared with the normal price before liberation, the current sugar purchase price has increased by more than 50%-60%, and the sugar price is not low."

Next, the debate focused on the question of "whether the state's purchase and sales price of sugar is actually low for purchases and high for sales, making too much money and exploiting farmers." Everyone comprehensively calculated such an account: The state's purchase price of high-quality sugar is sixteen yuan and sixty-eight cents, and the tax is more than eleven yuan, totaling more than twenty-eight yuan. The retail price is thirty-five yuan. On the surface, it seems that every hundred catties of sugar earns more than six yuan, but after deducting losses, packaging, transportation, storage and other expenses, the actual profit is not much. Only the part that is purchased and sold locally in the producing area makes some money. After everyone's debate, it was considered that this is also appropriate and reasonable, because the state has to transport sugar to remote areas and mountainous areas that do not produce sugar to supply them, and the freight costs are very high. In order to meet the needs of the people, the state often has to "sell at a loss" in these areas, so earning some money in the producing areas is actually the state "making up for losses with profits," which is reasonable. If the selling price in the producing area is very different from the selling price in the non-producing area, it will enable unscrupulous merchants to take the opportunity to engage in speculative business and exploit the people, which is detrimental to the country and all the people.

Now party members and township and cooperative cadres have distinguished the major issues of right and wrong on this issue, and some people have also reviewed their capitalist ideas of being unwilling to sell sugar to the state and wanting to engage in speculative trading themselves.

    糖的收购价格已经提高很多
    蔗农把糖卖给国家并不吃亏
    百色星明农业社党员和干部经过辩论分清是非
    本报讯　广西百色县逻索乡星明农业社，是一个以生产经济作物——甘蔗为主的合作社。这个社的部分社员与乡社干部，过去一直认为“将糖卖给糖业公司价钱太低了，不合算”，不愿意把糖卖给国家。为了弄清大是大非，这次该社在党员及乡社主要干部中就国家收购糖的问题，进行了大辩论。
    在辩论中大家以解放前与解放后的价格作了对比。解放前糖价较高的是“斤糖斤米”，一般的是一百斤糖换八十至九十斤大米。解放后糖价稳定，且今年比去年还有提高，过去每百斤上等片糖是十四元多，今年提高到十六元多；本社出产的糖质量较好，上、中等糖占多数，拉扯起来每百斤售价可得十五元多些，可买回大米一百五十多斤。经过这样算账对比后，一致承认说：现在糖的收购价格与解放前正常的价格对比，已经提高了50％—60％多，糖价不算低了”。
    接着辩论“国家在糖的收购与销售价格上，究竟是不是收的低，销的高，赚钱太多，剥削了农民”的问题。大家全面地算了这么一笔账：国家收购的上等糖价格是十六元六角八分，缴税是十一元多，共去二十八元多，零售价是三十五元，从表面上看来每百斤糖赚六元多，但除了损耗、包装、运输、保管等等费用外，实际赚不了多少钱，只在产地就地收购就地售出这部分赚些钱。经过大家辩论，认为这也是应该的和合理的，因为国家要把糖运往不产糖的边远地区及山区去供应，付出运费很多，国家为了满足人民群众需要，往往要在这些地区“赔本出售”，这样在产区赚些钱，实际上是国家“以赚补赔”，是合理的；如果产地的销售价与非产地的销售相差很远，会使不法商人乘机做投机倒把的生意，剥削人民，这样对国家、对全体人民不利。
    现在党员和乡社干部，在这个问题上分清了大是大非，有些人还检讨了不愿意把糖卖给国家想自己去搞投机买卖的资本主义思想。
