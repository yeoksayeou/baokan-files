    Go to the Grassroots! Go to Production!
    Sichuan Province Sends Down More Than 63,000 Cadres
    Yunnan Province and Kunming City Organ Cadres Respond to the Call to Go to the Countryside

    This newspaper reports that Sichuan Province, from the province level down to the county level, has abolished and merged more than 1,200 administrative organs such as sections, offices, and bureaus. Administrative organs above the district level throughout the province have already transferred more than 63,000 cadres to the grassroots, of which more than 36,000 directly participate in production. The vast majority of them have gone to agricultural cooperatives as members, and a few have gone to factories and handicraft units to participate in production. Among the cadres sent down, Communist Party members account for about one-half. Most of the cadres sent down to the countryside to participate in production originally worked in rural areas. After rectification and study, they have raised their awareness and voluntarily applied to return to the countryside. After being sent down, they can breathe the same air and share the same fate as the peasants, and are welcomed by the masses. The masses reflected that "Chairman Mao's method is really good, and he has sent you land reform cadres back home again." Originally, a few peasants and cooperative cadres thought that there was no future in the countryside and wanted to go down the mountain and into the city. Now, seeing that a large number of cadres have also returned to agricultural production, they have settled down and are determined to build a socialist countryside well. In order to implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is formulating a plan to further tighten up the institutions at all levels, reduce and send down cadres. It is estimated that the province can reduce a total of 120,000 cadres before next spring, accounting for about 25%-30% of the province's incumbent cadres.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming. Nearly a hundred units in Yunnan Province and Kunming City that have entered the third stage of the rectification movement are now focusing on tightening up administrative organs and transferring cadres to production and grassroots positions as the main link in improving their work. The number of cadres successively sent down by the provincial agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy systems has reached more than 800. The Provincial Department of Industry has transferred 70 technical cadres from its organs to work in grassroots units. Yunnan Province's universities and secondary vocational schools have transferred 300 theoretical education cadres to the countryside to participate in agricultural production and the socialist debate in rural areas. The provincial and municipal commercial systems are also taking measures to greatly tighten up the management organs of various specialized companies through mergers and cancellations, in order to minimize administrative personnel and strengthen grassroots units.

    The vast number of cadres enthusiastically responded to the call of "Go to the countryside, go to the grassroots," which made many leaders more and more determined and energetic in tightening up institutions and sending down cadres this time. Many organs have seen big-character posters calling for applications to be sent down or guaranteeing to support the sending down of cadres by improving work efficiency. After the first batch of cadres was sent down by the Provincial Department of Industry, the efficiency of the organs quickly improved. Therefore, the leadership decided to increase the proportion of cadres sent down from the original plan of 39% to more than 50%. Recently, the number of cadres in the Kunming Municipal Public Utilities Bureau who have applied to be sent down has exceeded the plan by about 30%.

    到基层去！到生产中去！
    四川省下放六万三千多名干部
    云南省和昆明市机关干部响应号召要求到农村
    本报讯　四川省从省到县已撤销和合并了一千二百多个科处局等行政机构，全省区级以上行政机关已经抽调了六万三千多干部下放到基层，其中直接参加生产的就有三万六千多人，他们绝大部分是到农业社当社员，少数人到工厂和手工业单位参加生产。在下放的干部中共产党员约占二分之一，下放到农村参加生产的干部，多数人原来就在农村劳动，这次经过整风学习，提高了觉悟，又自动申请回农村。他们下放后，都能和农民同呼吸共命运，受到群众的欢迎。群众反映说“毛主席的办法硬是好，又把你们这些土改干部送回家来了”。原来少数农民和社干曾认为农村没搞头想下山进城，现在看到大批干部也回到农业生产中来，也安下心来了，决心要把社会主义的农村建设好。为了贯彻三中全会的精神，中共四川省委正在拟定进一步紧缩各级机构减少和下放干部的方案，到明年春前，估计全省共可减少干部十二万人，约占全省在职干部的25％—30％。
    据新华社昆明电　云南省和昆明市已经转入整风运动第三阶段的近百个单位，目前都把紧缩行政机构、抽调干部到生产和基层岗位作为当前改进工作的主要环节。省级农林水利系统陆续下放的干部已达八百多人。省工业厅从机关中抽调了七十个技术干部到基层单位去工作。云南省各高等学校和中等专业学校，抽调了三百名理论教育干部到农村去参加农业生产和农村社会主义大辩论。省、市级商业系统也正在采取措施，通过合并、撤销，大大紧缩各专业公司的管理机构，以达到最大限度地减少行政人员，充实基层单位。
    广大干部热烈响应“到农村去，到基层去”的号召，使许多领导人员对这次紧缩机构和下放干部的决心越来越大，劲头越来越足。许多机关出现了报名要求下放或保证以提高工作效率来支持下放干部的大字报。省工业厅在第一批干部下放后，机关工作效率很快有了提高，因此，领导上又决定将下放干部的比例从原计划的39％提高到50％以上。昆明市公用事业局最近报名要求下放的干部已经超过计划30％左右。
