Qingyuan County Completes Peanut Unified Purchase Task

    (Reported) By the end of September, the amount of peanuts stored in Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province, reached 2,351,489 jin, exceeding the annual peanut unified purchase task by 210,000 jin, 20 days ahead of schedule compared to last year. Agricultural cooperative members in Qingyuan County voluntarily sold 500,000 jin of peanuts produced on their private plots to the state.

    This year, Qingyuan County had a bumper peanut harvest. After the unified purchase of peanuts began in early September, the county leaders, on the one hand, organized farmers to hold debates on the unified purchase and sale of oil; on the other hand, they strengthened market management, banned edible oil speculators, added temporary purchase points, and improved peanut purchase work, so they were able to complete the peanut unified purchase task quickly and well.

    清远县完成花生统购任务
    本报讯  到9月底止，广东省清远县花生入库数已达二百三十五万一千四百八十九斤，比去年提早二十天超额二十一万斤完成全年花生统购任务。清远县的农业社员们自愿把自留地出产的五十万斤花生卖给国家。
    今年清远县的花生获得大丰收。9月上旬花生统购工作开始以后，该县领导上一面组织农民展开油料统购统销问题的辩论；一面加强市场管理，取缔食油投机商贩，加设临时收购点，改进花生收购工作，因此能又快又好地完成花生统购任务。
