What Affectionate Songs and Dances
　　——Watching the Performance of the National Musical Drama Theatre Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic
　　Chen Yading
　　I just returned with the Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army from a visit to the Mongolian People's Republic. The farewell milk wine is still warming our hearts, the farewell calls are still ringing in our ears, and the tears of parting are still moistening our cheeks. Especially the friends from the National Musical Drama Theatre of the Mongolian People's Republic, we will never forget the days we spent together in Ulaanbaatar. They were our most enthusiastic teachers in learning the national art of the Mongolian people. We learned from each other, performed together, and addressed each other as brothers and sisters. Therefore, when we saw their wonderful performance again in the capital of our own country, we felt particularly close to every song and every dance. The audience applauded enthusiastically for every program they performed, cheering for their success again and again. All of this felt to us like applause and cheers for our own performance, and we were particularly excited.
　　Understanding and loving the national art of a country is inseparable from understanding and loving the people of that country. When we hear each song and see each dance, what we feel is not only the successful portrayal of the life of the Mongolian people in each artistic work, but also brings us infinite associations: the boundless green grassland, herds of cattle, horses, and sheep like clouds, white yurts like stars, large areas of golden crops, and the Mongolian people bravely advancing in the magnificent cause of building a socialist and beautiful life. All of this, a picture of life even more vivid and colorful than the national costumes of the Mongolian people, is displayed before our eyes with each song and dance successfully performed by their artists. It brings our reluctant hearts back to the beautiful Mongolian grassland, as if we were still living in the deep friendship of the Mongolian people, as if we had just spent those days and nights together on the grassland and in the yurts. In their loud and cheerful singing, it seems that there is also our voice; in their healthy dances, it seems that there is also our jumping, fiery heart.
　　This feeling is not unique to us. Although the depth of feeling may vary, I believe this is the common feeling of Chinese audiences towards the performance of the National Musical Drama Theatre Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic. Why does their performance have such great appeal? Where does their moving power lie?
　　First of all, the Mongolian artists brought us the long-standing and colorful national art of the Mongolian people, and it is so close to our own national art. This proves the long-standing close connection between China and Mongolia in culture and art. Therefore, when we heard the chorus of the choir, when we heard the songs of soloists Norbbanjide, Badarchin, Daoyodedorji, Tserendolgor, etc., when we saw the Ulianghai dance, the "Hotun" dance, the Buryat dance, and the Mongolian dance, we felt so close. Especially "Beautiful Hangai," a Mongolian folk song sung by Norbbanjide, the gold medalist of the 6th World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival. She is a young folk singer, and her bright voice is unique to the Mongolian people. The simple and broad emotions she expresses are cultivated by the grassland life. As soon as we hear her voice, we forget everything and are completely taken into the beautiful meditation of the Mongolian grassland. This is a national voice with a unique character, the voice of the free and happy Mongolian people.
　　Mongolian artists not only successfully and distinctively performed the art of their own nation, but more importantly, they skillfully used artistic techniques and traditional art forms to profoundly express the new life of the people. Through their singing and dancing, we can feel how confidently, joyfully, and vigorously the Mongolian people are living and working. What needs to be specially mentioned here is the "Buryat Folk Dance." Young men and women of the Mongolian Buryat ethnicity ride horses from the depths of the grassland to gather together for a carnival around a campfire during festivals, and then ride their horses back to their yurts. The young men are so brave, the girls are so healthy, they are full of vigor, they are enthusiastic and unrestrained. It is truly a picture of happy life on the grassland. Especially at the end of the dance, when the young men and women ride away on horseback, the expression of pride in their happy lives not only has a great encouraging power for the audience, but also leaves an unforgettable image in people's minds.
　　As far as I have seen, this troupe is one of the few foreign art troupes visiting China that perform Chinese programs, and they all perform very successfully. In particular, the female singer Badarchin's performance of Hebei Bangzi, with its beautiful voice, accurate singing, and clear pronunciation, is even more surprising. This not only shows the Mongolian artists' love for the national art of the Chinese people and their serious and earnest attitude towards learning, but also a profound expression of the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples, and a proof of the increasing development of cultural exchanges between China and Mongolia. At the same time, it also demonstrates the versatile and outstanding talents of the Mongolian artists.
　　We need to learn from the high artistic achievements of the Mongolian artists, learn from the rich experience of the Mongolian artists in developing national art and expressing new life, and learn from the spirit of the Mongolian artists in respecting, loving, and seriously learning the national art of fraternal countries and fraternal peoples. This learning has already begun during our visit to the Mongolian People's Republic this year. But compared to that, we have not learned enough, and we must make even greater efforts to learn in the future.
　　I wish the National Musical Drama Theatre Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic brilliant achievements in their performance tour in China. As brothers hand in hand, we are encouraged and delighted by your every achievement.

　　多么亲切的歌舞
　　——看蒙古人民共和国国家音乐话剧院艺术团演出
　　陈亚丁
    我随中国人民解放军歌舞团刚刚从蒙古人民共和国访问归来，送别的奶子酒还在温暖着我们的心，告别的呼唤还响在我们的耳边，惜别的眼泪还湿润着我们的双颊。特别是蒙古人民共和国国家音乐话剧院的朋友们，我们永远不会忘记在乌兰巴托时我们相处的日子。他们曾经是我们向蒙古人民的民族艺术学习的最热情的老师。我们在一起互相学习过，在一起合作演出过，互相都以兄弟姐妹相称，因此，当我们在自己祖国的首都又看到他们的精彩的演出的时候，对每一支歌，每一个舞蹈都感到特别亲切，观众为他们演出的每一个节目一次又一次地热烈鼓掌，为他们演出的成功一次又一次的欢呼，这一切在我们的心情上就像为我们的演出鼓掌和欢呼一样，我们感到特别激动。
    了解和热爱一个国家的民族艺术，是和了解和热爱这个国家的人民分不开的。当我们听到每一支歌曲，看到每一个舞蹈的时候，给我们的感受决不只是每一个艺术作品本身所成功地表现出来的蒙古人民的生活，还给我们带来了无限的联想，无边无际的碧绿的草原，云朵一般的牛群、马群、羊群，繁星一般的白色的蒙古包，大片的金黄色的庄稼，和正在建设社会主义美好生活的豪迈事业中勇敢前进的蒙古人民。这一切比蒙古人民的民族服装还要鲜艳多彩的生活图景，随着他们艺术家们成功地表演着的每一个歌舞展示在我们的眼前。把我们依依不舍的心又带回到美丽的蒙古草原，好像我们依然生活在蒙古人民的深情厚谊的怀抱里，好像我们在草原上、蒙古包里刚刚一起欢度过的那些白天和夜晚。在他们嘹亮而愉快的歌唱里好像也有我们的声音，在他们健美的舞蹈里好像也有我们跳跃着的火热的心。
    这种心情并不是我们所特有的，虽然感受的深浅可能有所不同，但我相信这是中国观众对蒙古人民共和国国家音乐话剧院艺术团演出的共同的感受。为什么他们的演出会有这样大的吸引力呢？他们感人的力量在那里呢？
    首先是蒙古的艺术家们给我们带来了蒙古人民历史悠久、丰富多彩的民族艺术，而且和我们自己的民族艺术又是那么接近，这证明中蒙两国在文化艺术上历史悠久的密切联系。因此，当我们听到合唱队的合唱，当我们听到独唱家诺尔布班吉德、巴达尔钦、道约德道尔吉、策仁道勒格尔等的歌声，当我们看到乌良海族舞、“浩屯”舞、布里亚特舞和蒙古舞的时候，我们感到那么亲切。特别是第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节金质奖章获得者诺尔布班吉德演唱的蒙古民歌“美丽的杭盖”，她是一位年轻的民间歌唱家，她的嘹亮的歌喉是蒙古人民所特有的，她所表现出来的朴实而开阔的情感，是草原生活所培养出来的，一听到她的声音，就会使我们忘记一切，完全被带到蒙古大草原的美丽的冥想中去。这是一种具有独特性格的民族的声音，自由幸福的蒙古人民的心声。
    蒙古的艺术家们不仅成功地、具有鲜明特色地表演了自己民族的艺术，而且，更可贵的是他们以熟练的艺术技巧，传统的艺术形式，深刻地表现了人民的新生活，通过他们的歌唱和舞蹈，我们可以感受到蒙古人民是多么自信地、愉快地、朝气勃勃地生活着和劳动着。在这里需要特别提出的是“布里亚特民间舞”，蒙古布里亚特族的青年男女们，在节日里从草原深处骑着骏马聚集到一起，围着营火狂欢，然后再骑上骏马向自己的蒙古包奔去。青年是那么勇敢，姑娘是那么健美，他们充满朝气，他们热情奔放，真是一幅再真实不过的草原幸福生活的图景。特别是舞蹈的结尾，青年男女们跨上骏马驰去，那种为自己幸福生活而感到自豪的神态，不仅对观众有很大的鼓舞力量，而且在人们心中留下了一个难忘的形象。
    据我所看到的，在来中国访问的外国艺术团中表演中国的节目，这个团是比较多的一个，而且都表演得非常成功，特别是女歌唱家巴达尔钦演唱的河北梆子，声音之幽美，唱腔之准确，咬字之清晰更使人感到惊奇。这不仅说明蒙古的艺术家们对中国人民的民族艺术的热爱，学习态度之严肃认真，而且也是中蒙两国人民牢不可破的永恒友谊的深刻的表示，中蒙两国文化交流日益发展的证明。同时，也表现出了蒙古艺术家们多方面的卓越的天才。
    我们需要向蒙古艺术家们高度的艺术成就学习，向蒙古艺术家们发扬民族艺术和表现新生活的丰富经验学习，向蒙古艺术家们尊重、热爱兄弟国家和兄弟人民的民族艺术并严肃认真地学习的精神学习。当我们今年在蒙古人民共和国访问期间，这种学习已经开始了。但比较起来，我们学习得还很不够，今后还要更进一步地努力地学习。
    祝蒙古人民共和国国家音乐话剧院艺术团在中国的访问演出获得辉煌的成就，作为手拉手的弟兄，我们为你们的每一个成就感到鼓舞和愉快。
