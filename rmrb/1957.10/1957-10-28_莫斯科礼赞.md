    Ode to Moscow
    Yuan Shuipai
    Moscow! Moscow! Capital of snow. Golden mountains and silver mountains are the magnificent buildings of socialism, dragon king palaces are the stations and roads of the underground train. What city in the world receives more admiration than you!
    Moscow! Moscow! Capital of snow, you are a flower blooming against the Siberian wind. The weather station reports that it is twenty degrees below zero tonight. In the theater, the fairies on Swan Lake resemble a light silk fluttering in the dance.
    Moscow! Moscow! Snowy capital. Pushing a stroller on the street, the snow has not yet stopped, "Little Katya, mommy will take you ice skating." Pink-cheeked daughter, pink-cheeked mother.
    Moscow! Moscow! Snowy capital. Towering palace walls, peaceful bells, after the snow clears, the Kremlin and Red Square are a crystal clear expanse. Praise it! The ground is brighter than the sky!
    Moscow! Moscow! Giant of victory! At your feet fell generation after generation of invaders. The people of the world defend you, and you defend the people of the world. Accept them! Kisses of celebration are sent to you from all over the Earth.

    莫斯科礼赞
    袁水拍莫斯科！莫斯科！雪的首都。金山银山是社会主义的宏伟建筑，龙王宫殿是地下车的车站、道路。世上哪有一个城市比您受到更多的爱慕！莫斯科！莫斯科！雪的首都，您是迎着西伯利亚寒风盛开的花朵。气象台报告说，今夜零下二十度。剧院里天鹅湖上的仙女像一幅轻罗翩翩舞。莫斯科！莫斯科！雪的京城。推着童车上街，雪还未停，“小卡佳，妈妈带你一起去溜冰。”粉红脸蛋的女儿，粉红脸蛋的母亲。莫斯科！莫斯科！雪的京城。巍峨的宫墙，和平的钟声，雪初晴，克里姆林、红场一片晶莹，赞美吧！地上比天上光明！莫斯科！莫斯科！胜利的巨人！在您脚边倒下了一代又一代的侵略军。世界人民捍卫您，您捍卫着世界人民。接受吧！地球各处给您送来了节日的亲吻。
