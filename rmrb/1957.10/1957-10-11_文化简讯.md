    San Yuan Li People's Anti-British Historical Materials Exhibition Hall Opens
    The San Yuan Li People's Anti-British Struggle Historical Materials Exhibition Hall in Guangzhou recently opened at the old site of the San Yuan Li Cultural Center. Through documents and pictures, the exhibition hall truthfully reflects the glorious historical traces of the San Yuan Li people's anti-imperialist and anti-British struggle in 1841. At that time, the ancient temple where the San Yuan Li people often gathered to resist the British army's invasion is now being renovated. After the renovation, the exhibition hall will be moved there. In addition, the old site of the Huanghua Gang Uprising Command is being repaired to its original state. A memorial hall will be established here to exhibit the historical events of the Huanghua Gang Uprising on March 29, 1911. The old site of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Strike Committee from 1925 to 1926 will also begin to be restored. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Shanghai Establishes Nationalities Club
    Shanghai recently established its first Nationalities Club, providing a place for more than 30,000 people from 25 ethnic minorities living in Shanghai to interact regularly. The club is located in a distinctive garden house in the western district of Shanghai. In the activity rooms on the first and second floors, there are pictures showing the improvement of the political status, economic and cultural life of the people of various ethnic minorities living in Shanghai after liberation, as well as the respect for their religious beliefs and living habits. These pictures vividly and powerfully refute the slander of right-wing elements among ethnic minorities who said that "the present is not as good as the past."
    In the past, most of the ethnic minorities living in Shanghai were small merchants and peddlers, and their lives were precarious. After liberation, their lives have not only stabilized, but also, with the government's preferential care, the number of employed people has increased year by year. Now, more than 9,000 people are employed. Among them, the number of workers has increased from more than 2,000 in 1951 to more than 5,000. The number of ethnic minority children attending school is also increasing. The number of ethnic minority primary school students in the city has increased by more than 1,000 compared with the early days of liberation, and the number of middle school students has doubled.

    Eradicating Illiteracy Among the Deaf and Mute
    The amateur literacy class held by the Tianjin School for the Deaf and Mute has enrolled 52 students, all of whom are deaf and mute youths aged 16 to 25, most of whom are workers. Because of work and other reasons during the day, they attend classes in the evening. The teachers plan to teach them about 1,000 characters and words within a year.

    上海设立民族俱乐部
    上海市最近设立了第一个民族俱乐部，这使居住在上海的二十五个少数民族三万多人有了一个经常接触的场所。俱乐部设在上海西区一所别致的花园洋房里。在一楼和二楼的活动室里，展出了居住在上海的各少数民族人民在解放后政治地位、经济文化生活得到提高以及他们的宗教信仰、生活习惯得到尊重的图片，这些图片生动有力地驳斥了少数民族中右派分子所说的“今不如昔”的谰言。
    居住在上海的少数民族人民过去大都是小商小贩，生活朝不保夕。解放后，他们的生活不但稳定了，而且在政府的优先照顾下，就业的人数年年增加，现在已有九千多人就业。其中工人已从1951年的两千多人发展到五千多人。少数民族子女读书的人数也越来越多，全市少数民族小学生比解放初期增加一千多名，中学生增加了一倍。
