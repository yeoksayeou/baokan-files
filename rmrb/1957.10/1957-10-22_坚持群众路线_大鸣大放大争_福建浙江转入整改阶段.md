Adhere to the Mass Line, Unleash Bold Expression, Fully Arouse Debate
Fujian and Zhejiang Enter the Rectification Phase

According to the Fujian Daily, the rectification movement in Fujian's provincial-level organizations is about to fully enter the third stage. On the 12th, Jiang Yizhen, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a mobilization report to Party members and cadres.

In his mobilization report, Jiang Yizhen said that the third stage of the rectification is the stage of rectifying ideological style and earnestly improving work. The general task of this stage is to adhere to the mass line and correctly handle contradictions among the people. Therefore, we must adopt the principle of unity-criticism-unity, adopt the mass line method, the democratic method, use a comradely and sincere attitude and the method of analyzing and discussing problems, patiently persuade and reason, and not use suppression or coercion.

Jiang Yizhen said: The third stage mainly solves the problems of sectarianism, subjectivism, and bureaucratism in leadership. These three "-isms" are the root causes of errors made by leaders, and these root causes lead to shortcomings and errors in work. From what we see now, there are mainly two problems: first, the systems, regulations, instructions, and notices issued by our leading organs are not in line with reality, or are either too centralized or "splittist," hindering the development of production and work; second, the leading organs and cadres are seriously divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. He said that overcoming these two problems is the specific task of rectification and reform. He emphasized: First, we must resolutely overcome sectarianism and the tendency of special privileges. Communist Party members must share weal and woe with the masses and be closely linked to them. We must make comprehensive arrangements and take all factors into consideration when handling matters. Second, we must change unreasonable systems and organizations. The problems of excessive centralization and unification must be corrected, and splittism must be rectified. We must be determined to reduce the size of institutions and delegate cadres to lower levels. Third, we must improve the democratic system and expand democratic life.

He went on to say that all units entering the rectification and reform phase must first solve the problem of the leadership's determination and the masses' confidence. Leaders must use practical actions of reform to inspire and educate the masses. We must launch a large-scale mass movement of rectification and reform at the same time.

According to the Zhejiang Daily, after achieving a decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a four-level cadre meeting on October 18 to push the province's rectification movement to a new climax. Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a mobilization speech at the meeting. He said that this meeting was a rectification meeting, and it was necessary to adopt the methods of "unleashing bold expression, fully arousing debate, fully contending, and fully debating," and fully utilize methods such as meeting speeches and big-character posters to "boldly unleash, resolutely unleash, and thoroughly unleash," and at the same time "boldly reform, resolutely reform, and thoroughly reform." He said that by unleashing bold expression, fully arousing debate, fully contending, and fully debating, we can solve major issues of right and wrong, and we can also solve minor issues of right and wrong, so that everyone can unify their understanding, correct their political orientation, improve their ideological level, overcome shortcomings and errors, and make the relationship between the Party and the masses closer, and carry out socialist construction faster and better.

After listening to the mobilization speech, the comrades present at the meeting began to deliberate separately. Many secretaries of prefectural and county Party committees expressed that they would take the lead in unleashing bold expression, and some began to write big-character posters that night.

    坚持群众路线  大鸣大放大争
    福建浙江转入整改阶段
    据福建日报讯　福建省级机关整风运动即将全面转入第三阶段。12日，省委书记江一真向党员干部作了动员报告。
    江一真在动员报告中说，整风的第三阶段就是整顿思想作风、认真改进工作的阶段。这一阶段总的任务是要坚持群众路线，正确处理人民内部矛盾。因此，必须根据团结——批评——团结的方针，采取群众路线的办法，民主的办法，用同志般的诚恳态度和分析讨论问题的方式，耐心说服，耐心讲理，不应用压服、强制的办法。
    江一真说：第三阶段主要是解决领导上的宗派主义、主观主义和官僚主义。这三个主义是领导者犯错误的病根子，由于这个病根子而产生工作上的缺点和错误。现在看来，主要是两方面的毛病，一是我们领导机关所规定的制度、章程和所发的指示、通知，不切合实际，或者是集中过多，或者是“分散主义”，阻碍生产和工作的发展；一是领导机关和干部严重地脱离群众，脱离实际。他说，克服这两方面的毛病，就是整改的具体任务。他着重提出：第一，必须坚决地克服宗派主义和特殊化的倾向，共产党员要与群众同甘苦同呼吸，办事情要全面安排，统筹兼顾。第二，改变不合理的制度和组织，过多集中和统一的毛病要纠正，分散主义要改正。下决心缩减机构和下放干部。第三，健全民主制度，扩大民主生活。
    他接着说，凡是转入整改的单位，首先要解决领导决心和广大群众的信心问题。领导者要用改的实际行动去鼓舞群众和教育群众。我们必须重新掀起一个规模浩大的群众性的边整边改高潮。
    据浙江日报讯　在反右派斗争取得了决定性的胜利以后，中共浙江省委10月18日召开全省四级干部会议，要把全省整风运动推向新的高潮。省委第一书记江华在大会上作动员讲话。他说这次会议是整风会议，要采取“大放、大鸣、大争、大辩”的办法，充分运用会议发言、大字报等形式“大胆地放、坚决地放、彻底地放”，同时也要“大胆地改、坚决地改、彻底地改”。他说，通过大放大鸣大争大辩来解决大是大非问题，也可以解决小是小非问题，使得大家统一认识，端正政治方向，提高思想水平，克服缺点错误，使党和群众的关系更加密切，又快又好地进行社会主义建设。
    到会的同志在听了动员讲话后，都分头进行酝酿。许多地委和县委书记都表示，要带头放鸣，有的当晚就动手写了大字报。
