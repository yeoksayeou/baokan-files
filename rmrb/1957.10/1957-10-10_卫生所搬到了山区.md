The Health Clinic Moves to the Mountains

Recently, Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, moved the Dabaozi Health Clinic, which had more medical facilities in the plains area, to the remote mountainous area of Wangjiawan. From then on, the sick farmers of Wangjiawan no longer have to travel thirty miles for treatment. Seeing such a health clinic with Western and Chinese medicine, and Western and Chinese drugs, the farmers happily said that this was something they wouldn't have dared to dream of in the old society.

    卫生所搬到了山区
    河北省宣化县最近将医疗机构较多的平原地区的大堡子卫生所迁移到王家湾偏僻山区，从此，王家湾患病的农民用不着再到三十里外去治疗了。农民们看见这样一个有西医有中医，有西药有中药的卫生所，都欢喜地说，这在旧社会是连做梦也不敢想的事情。
