Unity and Solidarity Are the Common Demand of Workers Worldwide
Yang Chongguang

The Fourth World Trade Union Congress is scheduled to be held in Leipzig, Democratic Germany, from October 4th to 15th. This is a grand gathering for the broad unity of workers worldwide. Like workers in all countries around the world, Chinese workers greet the convening of this congress with excitement and enthusiasm.

Since its founding, the World Federation of Trade Unions has actively fought to defend world peace, safeguard the democratic rights of workers, and protect workers' living and working conditions. It is a banner of the international workers' movement.

Now, four years have passed since the Third World Trade Union Congress held in Vienna in October 1953. During this period, the world workers' movement has made great progress. We have seen the outstanding contributions made by the workers of socialist countries in the cause of building socialism and communism, which have had a far-reaching impact on the international workers' movement; the workers' struggle in capitalist countries is rising higher and higher, and they have waged heroic struggles against the exploitation and oppression of monopoly capital; in countries that have achieved national independence and are striving for national independence, workers are playing an increasingly important role in the struggle to consolidate and achieve national independence. We have also seen new progress in the trade union unity movement in many countries, the friendly ties between trade unions in various countries are strengthening day by day, the trend of regional alliances is developing, and more and more trade union organizations are advocating international trade union unity and cooperation. All this shows that in countries with different social systems, the goals of workers' struggles are consistent, that is, to oppose monopoly capital, to oppose colonialism, and to build a peaceful and happy new life without exploitation and oppression. During this period, the World Federation of Trade Unions has done a lot of work and made important contributions to the international workers' movement.

However, the current division of the international workers' movement greatly hinders the workers' struggle, making it impossible for the struggles of workers in various countries to be coordinated consciously and in a planned way, which is beneficial to imperialism.

According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 166 million organized workers worldwide, who are affiliated with four types of trade union organizations: 88 million are affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions; 55 million are affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions; 3 million are affiliated with the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions; and approximately 20 million are affiliated with various independent trade union organizations.

At present, trade union members in socialist countries number more than 80 million, accounting for about half of the total number of organized workers in the world. Trade union organizations in socialist countries are united nationwide, and the number of members accounts for more than 80% to 90% of the total number of employees. Trade union organizations in capitalist countries are not very widespread, and their development is also uneven. The number of members generally accounts for only 25% to 35% of the total number of workers, and in individual cases, up to 50%. Of the more than 320 million workers in the world, only about half have been organized.

Due to the division of trade union organizations, monopoly capital is greatly facilitated in attacking workers, putting workers in a serious disadvantageous position in the face of monopoly capital, and workers' rights will be seriously violated. For example, in Italy, between 1944 and 1948, the Italian workers' movement, based on the victory of the anti-fascist struggle, reached an unprecedented unity. In 1944, the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party signed the "Trade Union Unity Charter" convention, which directly led to the establishment of the Italian General Confederation of Labor the following year, creating the first trade union unity in Italy in decades. The number of members greatly exceeded any period in history, and workers also obtained many political and material benefits, such as the signing of a number of national contracts, and the "wage adjustment according to price" system was also obtained during this period. However, with the implementation of the "Marshall Plan" in 1947, American imperialism colluded with the Italian bourgeoisie to undermine the unity of trade unions in every possible way. In 1948 and 1949, members of the Christian Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party within the Italian General Confederation of Labor withdrew from the Italian General Confederation of Labor under various pretexts, and established the Italian Confederation of Labor Unions and the Italian Labor Alliance. Although the Italian General Confederation of Labor was attacked, it still maintained its advantage in the balance of power of trade unions nationwide.

The division of trade unions has brought serious consequences to the Italian working people. This is particularly evident in the widening gap between profits and wages. According to statistics, from 1948 to the first half of 1956, that is, during the period of the division of the workers' movement, the profits of capitalists reached an incredible level. According to the annual report of the Bank of Italy, from 1950 to 1955, the net profit of this bank increased by an average of 86%. The profits of the twelve major industrial monopoly capitalists in Italy increased by an astonishing figure of 439% from 1948 to 1955. During the same period, the real wages of Italian workers increased by only 19%, and it was won at the cost of a cruel struggle. The impoverishment of the Italian working people is also reflected in the fact that although the economy is rising, it still maintains a huge reserve army of two million fully unemployed workers and two million semi-unemployed workers.

From the example of Italy, we can clearly see how much loss the division of the workers' movement brings to the working people. It is precisely by taking advantage of the division of trade unions that monopoly capitalists intensify their exploitation of workers and obtain huge profits, and workers only suffer deeply. Therefore, unity and solidarity have become the mass and urgent demand of workers worldwide.

How to achieve the unity and solidarity of international trade unions is the theme of this conference.

At present, various international and domestic trade union organizations have different political tendencies. The difference in political tendencies does not mean that these trade union organizations cannot carry out united action. Because workers in various countries are consistent in their basic interests, they have common points on many issues, such as defending world peace, safeguarding national independence, opposing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, improving workers' lives, safeguarding trade union rights, and improving working conditions. The views of many trade unions are relatively close or even the same on these issues. As long as we are good at finding these common points and achieving unity on this basis, it is entirely possible.

The struggle situation of workers in various countries in recent times shows that as long as trade unions of various political tendencies adopt an attitude of mutual respect and friendly consultation, and achieve the unity of domestic or international trade unions through this method of seeking common ground while reserving differences, it can be done. There are many such examples.

Since this spring, French workers have carried out a series of struggles and achieved important victories, in which several strikes were jointly participated in by various factions of trade unions. The most noteworthy is the forty-eight-hour general strike held by 500,000 transport workers in France on April 17th and 18th. The strike was first initiated by the French General Confederation of Labor and the Catholic Labor Federation, and the "Worker Power" trade union finally participated under the pressure of the workers. The main demand of the strike was to increase wages. This strike showed broadness and solidarity. Because the French government is carrying out the Algerian war, the daily war cost is about one billion francs, which has caused great difficulties to the domestic economy, and prices continue to rise. On the one hand, the French government has proposed a plan to reduce civil fiscal expenditures and increase taxes. On the other hand, it has used the so-called "law of mutual causation between wages and prices" to deceive workers, saying that raising wages will increase prices, in order to cope with the French workers' growing demand to improve their lives. This has been opposed by workers of all factions. Therefore, this strike reflected the opinions of the masses of workers of all factions. The political tendencies of the trade unions are different, but they are united in action.

The unity and solidarity of workers in various countries is becoming more and more urgent today because monopoly capital is attacking workers more and more rampantly. Monopoly capital in Western Europe is using supranational alliances to deal with workers in its own country and in colonial countries. The European Coal and Steel Community, the European Atomic Energy Community, and the European Common Market are all means for monopoly capitalists to use international alliances to deal with workers in various countries. Its reactionary nature is very obvious, which cannot but arouse the vigilance of workers in capitalist countries.

The slogan of opposing the testing and use of nuclear weapons has become the common demand of workers in various countries. Workers in Japan who have joined trade unions of various factions are more closely united under this common demand. Under the promotion of trade unions, the Japanese movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs has become a national movement. The struggle of British workers against nuclear weapons has also made new progress.

In countries that have achieved national independence and are striving for national independence, opposing colonialism and safeguarding national independence have become the common demands of workers in these countries. During the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, Egyptian and all Arab workers took resolute actions to support the Nasser government's just actions to defend the national sovereignty of Arab countries and oppose imperialist aggression. The Egyptian workers' movement has made great progress in recent years, and 750,000 members have united around the Egyptian Trade Union Federation. Workers in various Arab countries are further united on the basis of anti-colonialism. In March of last year, the Arab Trade Union International Federation, in which trade unions from six Arab countries participated, was established, which has great significance in the history of the Arab countries' workers' movement. In the heart of Africa, the Cotonou Conference, which included trade unions of various factions (except the "Worker Power" trade union) from French West Africa, Equatorial Africa, Togo and Cameroon, was held from January 16th to 19th this year. At this conference, the birth of the General Confederation of Black African Trade Unions was announced, which plays an important role in the development of the French African workers' movement.

Between socialist and capitalist countries, despite the different political systems, friendly relations have also been established between trade unions of various countries due to mutual respect, solidarity and friendship, seeking common ground while reserving differences. Since 1954, a total of 232 trade union delegations from various countries, with 1,617 people, representing 59 countries, have been invited to visit our country. This year alone, 203 representatives from 85 trade union organizations in 37 countries were invited to participate in the May Day celebrations in our country. These representatives included various political tendencies. Since 1954, the Chinese trade union has also sent 111 delegations, with 606 people, to visit 26 countries. Through these mutual visits, the Chinese trade union has established and deepened friendly relations with many countries around the world, especially various trade union organizations in Asia and Africa, thereby promoting the development of international trade union unity and solidarity.

When Marx wrote the "Communist Manifesto" in 1848, he issued a loud call to workers all over the world: "Workers of all countries, unite!" How much practical significance does this have today! Unity and solidarity are the common demands of workers all over the world. The trade unions of socialist countries are promoting the unity and solidarity of international trade unions with their own efforts. As long as workers all over the world work together, the goal of international trade union solidarity will definitely be achieved.

    统一团结是全世界工人的共同要求
    杨重光
    世界工会第四次代表大会定于10月4日至15日在民主德国来比锡举行。这是全世界工人广泛团结的大会。中国工人像全世界各国工人一样，怀着兴奋热烈的心情，迎接这次大会的召开。
    世界工会联合会从成立的第一天起，就积极为保卫世界和平、维护工人的民主权利、保卫工人的生活条件和工作条件而斗争，它是国际工人运动的一面旗帜。
    现在，离开1953年10月在维也纳举行的世界工会第三次代表大会，已经有四年了。在这一时期里，世界工人运动有了很大的发展。我们看到社会主义各国工会在建设社会主义和共产主义事业中作出了出色的贡献，对国际工人运动产生着深远的影响；资本主义国家工人斗争愈来愈高涨，他们对于垄断资本的剥削和压迫，作了英勇的斗争；在民族独立和正在争取民族独立的国家，工会在巩固和争取民族独立的斗争中起着日益重大的作用。我们还看到很多国家的工会统一运动有了新的进展，各国工会之间的友好联系日益加强，区域联合的趋势正在发展，主张国际工会统一和合作的工会组织日益增多。这些都说明，在社会制度不同的国家里，工人斗争的目标却是一致的，这就是反对垄断资本，反对殖民主义，建设一个没有剥削、压迫的和平幸福的新生活。世界工会联合会在这一时期，做了很多工作，为国际工人运动提供了重要贡献。
    但目前国际工人运动的分裂，极大地阻碍了工人的斗争，使各国工人的斗争不能有意识、有计划地配合，这是有利于帝国主义的。
    根据不完全的统计，目前全世界有组织的工人共一亿六千六百万人，他们分别加入四种工会组织：加入世界工会联合会的有八千八百万人；加入国际自由工会联合会的有五千五百万人；加入国际天主教工会联合会的有三百万人；加入各个独立的工会组织总数约有二千万人。
    目前，各社会主义国家的工会会员有八千多万人，约占全世界有组织的工人数目的一半。社会主义国家的工会组织是全国团结一致的，会员人数占全体职工人数的80％到90％以上。资本主义国家的工会组织不很普遍，发展也不平衡，会员人数一般只占全体工人总数的25％到35％，个别的到50％。在全世界三亿二千多万工人中，已经组织起来的工人只有一半左右。
    由于工会组织的分裂，大大便利了垄断资本对工人的进攻，使工人们在垄断资本面前处于严重的劣势地位，工人的权利就会遭到严重的侵犯。譬如，在意大利，1944—1948年间，意大利的工人运动，在反法西斯斗争胜利的基础上，曾经达到空前的统一。1944年，意大利共产党和社会党签订了“工会统一宪章”公约，这个公约直接促成第二年意大利总工会的成立，造成了意大利数十年来第一次工会统一的局面。会员人数大大超过了历史上任何时期，工人也得到很多政治上和物质上的利益，如签订了一些全国性的合同，“按物价调整工资”的制度也是这时期内获得的。但随着1947年“马歇尔计划”的实行，美帝国主义勾结意大利资产阶级，千方百计地破坏工会的统一。1948年和1949年，意大利总工会内的天主教民主党和社会民主党成员，以各种借口退出了意大利总工会，另外建立了意大利劳动人民工会联合会和意大利劳工联盟。意大利总工会虽然受到攻击，在全国工会的力量对比中仍旧保持了优势。
    工会的分裂给意大利劳动人民带来了严重的后果。这特别明显地表现在利润和工资的差别性愈来愈大。据统计，从1948年到1956年上半年，也即是工人运动分裂的时期里，资本家的利润达到了难以置信的程度。又据意大利银行的年度报告，从1950年到1955年，这家银行的纯利平均增长86％。意大利十二个大工业垄断资本家的利润，从1948年到1955年增长了439％这样惊人的数字。在同一时期，意大利工人的实际工资仅增加了19％，而且是用残酷斗争的代价换来的。意大利劳动人民的贫困化，还表现在经济虽然上升，但仍保持着二百万全失业工人和二百万半失业工人这样庞大的失业后备军。
    从意大利的例子，我们可以清楚地看到，工人运动的分裂给劳动人民带来多么大的损失，垄断资本家正是利用工会的分裂加紧压榨工人，获取巨额利润，工人只有深受其害。因此，统一团结就成为全世界工人的群众性的迫切要求。
    怎样才能达到国际工会的统一团结，这正是这次大会讨论的主题。
    目前，各国际和国内工会组织具有不同的政治倾向。政治倾向的不同并不就是说这些工会组织不能进行统一行动。由于各国工人在基本利益上是一致的，他们在许多问题上都有着共同点，如在保卫世界和平、维护民族独立、反对原子武器和氢武器、改善工人生活保卫工会权利、改善劳动条件等问题上很多工会的观点是比较接近甚至相同的。只要我们善于找寻这些共同点，在这个基础上达到团结，就完全是可能的。
    最近这一时期，各国工人的斗争情况说明，只要各种政治倾向的工会，以相互尊重、友好协商的态度，通过这种求同存异的方法，来达到国内或国际工会的团结，是能够做到的。这样的例子是很多的。
    法国工人自从今年春天以来进行了一系列的斗争，获得了重要胜利，其中有好几次罢工都是各派工会统一参加的。最值得注意的是，法国五十万交通运输工人在4月17、18日举行的四十八小时大罢工，罢工由法国总工会和天主教劳工联合会首先创议，“工人力量”工会在工人群众压力下也最后参加了。罢工的主要要求是增加工资。这次罢工表现了广泛性和团结性。由于法国政府进行阿尔及利亚战争，每天的战争费用约十亿法郎，造成国内经济的极大困难，物价不断高涨。法国政府一面提出缩减民用财政开支和增加税收方案，一面又搬用所谓“工资与物价互为因果的规律”欺骗工人，说提高工资物价即上涨，来应付法国工人日益增长的改善生活的要求，这遭到各派工人的反对，因而这次罢工反映了各派工人群众的意见，工会的政治倾向不同，但在行动中统一起来了。
    各国工人的统一团结，今天所以愈来愈迫切，还因为垄断资本对工人的进攻日益猖狂。西欧的垄断资本正以超国家的联合来对付本国和殖民地国家的工人。欧洲煤钢联营、欧洲原子能联营、欧洲共同市场，都是垄断资本家以国际的联盟来对付各国工人的手段，它的反动性十分明显，这不能不引起资本主义国家工人的警惕。
    反对试验和使用核子武器的口号，成为各国工人的共同要求。日本加入各派工会的工人，在这个共同要求下，团结得更加紧密了，在工会的推动下，日本反对原子弹和氢弹运动已成为全民性的运动。英国工人反对核子武器的斗争也有新的发展。
    在民族独立和正在争取民族独立的国家，反对殖民主义、维护民族独立成为这些国家工人的共同要求。在英、法、以侵略埃及期间，埃及和所有阿拉伯国家的工人以坚决的行动支持纳赛尔政府保卫阿拉伯国家民族主权、反对帝国主义侵略的正义行动。埃及的工人运动，最近几年来有了很大发展，在埃及工会联合会周围，已团结了七十五万会员。阿拉伯各国工人在反殖民主义的基础上进一步团结起来。去年3月，有六个阿拉伯国家工会参加的阿拉伯工会国际联合会成立了，这在阿拉伯国家工人运动历史上具有重大的意义。在非洲腹地，今年1月16日到19日召开了包括法属西非洲、赤道非洲、多哥和喀麦隆各派工会（除“工人力量”工会以外）参加的柯多诺会议，在这个会上宣告了黑非工会总联合会的诞生，这对法属非洲工人运动的开展，起着重要的作用。
    在社会主义和资本主义国家之间，尽管政治制度不同，由于各国工会相互尊重，团结友好，求同存异，彼此也建立了友好的关系。自1954年以来，应邀到我国访问的各国工会代表团，共有二百三十二个，一千六百一十七人，代表了五十九个国家。单是今年应邀参加我国五一观礼的外国代表团，就有来自三十七个国家八十五个工会组织的二百零三个代表，这些代表包括了各种政治倾向。1954年来，我国工会也派出了一百一十一个代表团，六百零六人到二十六个国家访问。通过这些相互访问，中国工会与全世界许多国家，特别是亚非地区的各派工会组织，建立并加深了友好关系，从而也推动了国际工会统一团结的发展。
    马克思在1848年写“共产党宣言”的时候，就向全世界工人发出响亮的号召：“全世界无产者联合起来！”这在今天是具有多么大的现实意义啊！统一团结是全世界工人的共同要求，社会主义国家的工会以自己的努力促进国际工会的统一团结，只要全世界工人共同努力，国际工会团结的目标是一定会达到的。
