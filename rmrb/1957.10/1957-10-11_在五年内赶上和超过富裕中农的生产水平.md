Catch Up and Surpass the Production Level of Rich Middle Peasants Within Five Years

Our agricultural production has developed significantly during the first Five-Year Plan, but it still cannot fully meet the growing needs of national construction and people's lives. Our current question is: Can the development speed of agricultural production be faster?

The answer is yes. The development speed of our agricultural production should and can be faster. We should strive to have the majority of cooperatives in most regions catch up with or surpass the production level of rich middle peasants during the second Five-Year Plan. That is to say, the total income of the collective economy of the majority of cooperatives, plus the income from sideline occupations of cooperative members' families, should, on a per capita basis, catch up with or surpass the level of local rich middle peasants.

Chairman Mao said: "In China, the rich peasant economy is very weak... The strength of the rich and relatively rich middle peasants is quite strong, accounting for 20% to 30% of the rural population. In China's rural areas, an important aspect of the struggle between the two roads is manifested through the peaceful competition between poor and lower-middle peasants and rich middle peasants." (See the footnote to the article "Who Says Chickens Can't Fly to Heaven" in the book "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside")

The majority of cooperatives in most regions catching up and surpassing the production level of rich middle peasants within five years is a great leap forward in China's agricultural production and a sign of the final victory of socialism in the struggle between the two roads in the countryside.

According to typical surveys in various regions, the unit area yield of rich middle peasants is about 20% higher than that of newly established cooperatives. If cooperatives across the country can catch up with and surpass the production level of rich middle peasants, the unit yield of our farmland and the total agricultural output will increase by about 20% to 30%, or even more. It is possible and necessary to achieve this requirement.

Some of the rich middle peasants who have already joined the cooperatives have not yet finally recognized the superiority of the collectivization system and have not completely abandoned their plans to withdraw from the cooperatives. Those rich middle peasants who have not joined the cooperatives will even more use various methods to spread the ideological influence of capitalism. As a class, rich middle peasants still do not believe in socialism. Only when the production level of the vast majority of cooperatives surpasses them can they finally abandon their dreams of the capitalist road and stand on the side of socialism willingly.

Can this goal be achieved within five years? If everything that should be done is done, this goal can definitely be achieved. Judging from the experience of running cooperatives in various regions, well-run cooperatives can catch up with and surpass the production level of local rich middle peasants in two or three years. After surpassing this level, they can continue to develop at the original speed. Other cooperatives should of course be able to do it in another five years. Many regions, such as Handan Prefecture in Hebei, already have 20% of their cooperatives catching up with and surpassing the production level of local rich middle peasants. Some may say that the counties under Handan Prefecture are mostly old liberated areas, with a foundation for mutual assistance and cooperation, so production development is naturally faster, but this cannot be done in late liberated areas. This view is incorrect. Zhangye Prefecture in Gansu is a late liberated area. In the first year after collectivization, agricultural production increased by more than 28%, and cooperatives throughout the prefecture also caught up with the production level of rich middle peasants. Some may also say that Zhangye Prefecture is the famous and prosperous "Hexi Corridor," so production development is naturally fast; it won't work in poor areas. This view is still incorrect. Lianping County in Guangdong is both a late liberated area and a poor mountainous area. In the first year after collectivization—1956—production developed rapidly, and more than 60% of cooperative members caught up with the living standards of local middle peasants. It is estimated that this year, 90% of cooperative members can catch up with the living standards of middle peasants. From this, it seems that whether it is an old liberated area or a late liberated area, whether it is a relatively prosperous area or a relatively poor area, as long as the work is done well, it is possible to achieve this goal within five years.

The means of production of rich middle peasants, on a per capita basis, are more and better than those of agricultural cooperatives. This is where they are stronger than newly established cooperatives, and it is also the capital for them to dare to compete with agricultural cooperatives. The Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Longyao County, Hebei, compared itself with three rich middle peasant households in the village: rich middle peasants each owned 3.46 mu of cultivated land (also of good quality), each draft animal was responsible for 17.3 mu of cultivated land, and each mu of cultivated land was fertilized with 90 jin of fine fertilizer; the agricultural cooperative on average each owned more than 2 mu of cultivated land (many of which were of poor quality), each draft animal was responsible for 26.7 mu of cultivated land, and each mu was fertilized with 50 jin of fine fertilizer. However, the result of the competition was that the cooperative surpassed the production level of rich middle peasants within two years. Why is this? Each laborer in the Dengta Agricultural Cooperative was responsible for 4.8 mu of cultivated land, while each laborer in the three rich middle peasant households was responsible for 8.6 mu, almost twice as much. The cooperative fully utilized the condition of abundant labor, developed basic construction, unified the use of land, rationally utilized water conservancy, and implemented diversified operations, quickly creating "miracles" that rich middle peasants could not imagine. "Cooperatives have many people and great strength," the rich middle peasants finally had to admit.

From the above situation, in order to rapidly improve the production level of agricultural production cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives must fully utilize the superiority of collective management and overcome various shortcomings and unfavorable conditions. Here, appropriately increasing the public accumulation of cooperatives and developing agricultural basic construction are of great significance.

For the development of agricultural production, the state will pay more attention to water conservancy construction, the fertilizer industry, the agricultural machinery industry, and other industries that promote agricultural development during the second Five-Year Plan. However, state investment can only be placed in those key areas and cannot solve all problems. The development of agriculture must mainly rely on the cooperatives' own accumulation and their own manpower. Appropriately increasing public accumulation is not only a reliable way for cooperatives to increase production and increase income, but also the material foundation for consolidating collective ownership.

The prerequisite for increasing public accumulation and carrying out basic construction within the cooperative is to properly resolve the contradiction between consumption and accumulation, between the individual and the collective, and to overcome the tendency to one-sidedly pursue individual interests and immediate interests, while ignoring collective interests and long-term interests. In the initial stage of the establishment of the cooperative, in order to stabilize the emotions of the members, it was correct to implement the distribution method of "deducting less and distributing more" and to take more care of the members' needs to improve their lives. Now that the lives of the majority of members have improved to varying degrees, there are already better conditions to propose increasing public accumulation and developing basic construction. It should be made clear to the vast number of members: the majority of the members of the cooperative are the original poor and lower-middle peasants, and their "family wealth" is very thin, so it is not easy to catch up with the production level of rich middle peasants for a while. We must use our own hands to build up the "family wealth" as soon as possible, and we should not distribute all the income. Accumulating one point this year and using it to develop production may yield two or three points next year. If we do not pay attention to accumulation now, not to mention surpassing the production level of rich middle peasants, it will not be easy for some cooperatives to maintain their existing production level. Last autumn, the Xinan Village Cooperative in Feixiang County, Hebei, distributed most of the grain money to the members; the members built more than ninety new houses and bought more than twenty bicycles, and everyone was very happy at the time. However, the cooperative had no funds, and finally had to sell two mules to barely maintain production. How can the production level be improved by doing things this way? Contrary to this situation, the Rongsheng Cooperative in Wu'an County broke through the muddled thinking of some members who "only care about enjoyment and not production" and planned to increase the public accumulation fund from 2.2% to 8% after this autumn, which will be used to build a small pumping station and a granular fertilizer factory. With sufficient water and fertilizer, the production level of this cooperative will be greatly improved from next year. On the basis of gradually improving the production level and living standards, it is of great help to production for cooperatives to accumulate more appropriately; it will not have a serious impact on life for members to distribute less appropriately. All members should be educated to focus on the big picture and actively support this approach. As for many members who waste the results of production on eating, drinking, weddings, funerals, superstition, gambling, etc., instead of using them for accumulation and savings, this bad phenomenon must be persuaded and corrected with great efforts.

The basic construction of cooperatives should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. Based on the principle of using more effort and spending less money, we should first carry out key construction projects. Many cooperatives that have already surpassed the production level of rich middle peasants have almost all solved the key problems hindering production development, especially water conservancy problems, by concentrating their efforts. In our country, too much water causes floods, and too little water causes drought. This is the main enemy of agricultural production. As long as dry land is turned into paddy fields and floods are completely eliminated, output can be increased by tens or even hundreds of percent at once. Farmers in Yuxi Prefecture, Yunnan, estimate that their income in 1957 can increase by 108% compared with 1952, and all reach the living standards of middle peasants. The most important reason is the development of water conservancy, which has turned 1.18 million mu of the 2.02 million mu of cultivated land into paddy fields. Cooperative water conservancy construction should be mainly small-scale. It has great effect, quick benefits, requires a lot of labor, and costs less money, which is completely in line with the actual situation of most agricultural cooperatives with abundant labor and little funds. Agricultural output increase is the comprehensive effect of various conditions. In addition to water conservancy construction, other basic construction projects, such as land consolidation, afforestation, pig raising and manure accumulation, and adding draft animals, should also be carried out as quickly as possible within the limits of ability, the more the better.

In order to catch up with and surpass the production level of rich middle peasants within five years, it is also necessary to particularly strengthen the operation and management of cooperatives, and implement the policy of democratic management and frugal management. Cooperatives are large-scale mass collective economic organizations. As long as the operation and management are good, the labor potential of the members is fully utilized, and the publicly owned means of production of the entire cooperative are used in the most appropriate place, it will not take long to catch up with and surpass the production level of rich middle peasants. If the operation and management are not good, the phenomena of no one being responsible, lax discipline, and waste of manpower and funds may occur. Many "poor stick cooperatives" that were ridiculed by rich middle peasants have become richer cooperatives than them within a few years. There is no mystery in this. It's just that they have truly achieved democratic management and frugal management. In order to get rich, many rich middle peasants always get up early and go to bed late, use all their labor for production, and save every penny they can save. Cooperatives should learn their spirit of diligence and thrift, and improve their own operation and management. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Instructions on Doing a Good Job in the Production Management of Agricultural Cooperatives" on September 14 this year, systematically summarizing the experience of running cooperatives over the past few years, and comprehensively stipulating the policies and guidelines for the operation and management of cooperatives; by truly implementing the spirit of this instruction into their daily work, the majority of cooperatives will definitely be able to catch up with and surpass the production level of rich middle peasants within five years.

Catching up with and surpassing the production level of rich middle peasants within five years is a major task of rural work in the future. We suggest that the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees, prefectural party committees, county party committees, and people's committees at all levels conduct a serious inspection of this situation to see which agricultural cooperatives have already surpassed the production level of local rich middle peasants? How did they surpass them? What experience can be promoted? Which agricultural cooperatives have not yet caught up with the production level of local rich middle peasants, and how should they catch up? These should be formulated into practical and feasible plans to help them achieve this goal in stages and in batches.

### 在五年内赶上和超过富裕中农的生产水平

　　在五年内赶上和超过富裕中农的生产水平
    我国的农业生产在第一个五年计划期间有了显著的发展，但还不能充分满足国家建设和人民生活日益增长的需要。我们当前的问题是：能不能使农业生产发展的速度更快些？
    答案是肯定的。我国农业生产的发展速度应该和可能更快些。我们应该争取多数地区的多数合作社，在第二个五年计划期间，赶上或超过富裕中农的生产水平。也就是说，使多数合作社集体经济的收入，加上社员家庭副业收入，总计起来，按人平均，赶上或超过当地富裕中农的水平。
    毛主席说过：“在中国，富农经济很弱……富裕的和比较富裕的中农的力量却是相当强大的，他们占农村人口的20％到30％。在中国的农村中，两条道路的斗争的一个重要方面，是通过贫农和下中农同富裕中农实行和平竞赛表现出来的。”（见“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书中“谁说鸡不能上天”一文的按语）
    多数地区的多数合作社在五年内赶上和超过富裕中农的生产水平，这是我国农业生产的一个大跃进，也是社会主义在农村两条道路斗争中获得最后胜利的一个标志。
    根据各个地区的典型调查，富裕中农的单位面积产量，大约比初建的合作社高20％左右。全国的合作社如果都能赶上和超过富裕中农的生产水平，我国的农田单位产量和农业总产量就将提高约20％至30％，或者更多一些。实现这个要求是可能的，也是必要的。
    现在已经加入合作社的富裕中农，有一部分还没有最后承认合作化制度的优越性，还没有完全放弃退社的打算。那些没有入社的富裕中农，就更加要用各种方法，散布资本主义的思想影响。作为一个阶层来说，富裕中农还有一些不信服社会主义。只有绝大多数合作社的生产水平超过他们，他们才能最后放弃资本主义道路的梦想，心悦诚服地站到社会主义这一边来。
    能不能在五年内达到这个目标呢？如果把该作的事情都作了，肯定可以达到这个目标。从各个地区办社的经验看来，凡是办得好的合作社，有两、三年的时间，就能赶上和超过当地富裕中农的生产水平。而在超过这个水平以后，还能保持原有的速度继续向前发展。其他的合作社再有五年，当然也应该办到了。许多地区，例如河北邯郸专区，已经有20％的合作社赶上和超过当地富裕中农的生产水平。有人或许会说，邯郸专区所属各县多是老解放区，互助合作素有基础，生产发展当然快些，但在晚解放区就作不到。这种看法不对。甘肃张掖专区是晚解放区，在合作化后第一年，农业增产28％以上，全区合作社也赶上了富裕中农的生产水平。有人或许还会说，张掖专区是出名富庶的“河西走廊”，生产发展自然快；在贫瘠地区就不行了。这种看法还是不对。广东连平县既是晚解放区，又是贫瘠山区，在合作化后第一年——1956年，生产获得迅速发展，60％以上的社员赶上当地中农的生活水平，估计今年可有90％的社员赶上中农的生活水平。这样看来，不管是老解放区或者晚解放区，不管比较富庶的地区或者比较贫瘠的地区，只要工作作好了，在五年内达到这个目标都是可能的。
    富裕中农的生产资料，按人口平均，比农业社要多要好。这是他们强过初建的合作社的地方，也是他们敢于同农业社比赛的本钱。河北隆尧县灯塔农业社和本村三户富裕中农作过比较：富裕中农每人占有耕地三点四六亩（质量也好），每头耕畜负担耕地十七点三亩，每亩耕地施细肥九十斤；农业社平均每人占有耕地二亩多（许多耕地质量也差），每头耕畜负担耕地二十六点七亩，每亩施细肥五十斤。可是，比赛结果，合作社在两年以内超过了富裕中农的生产水平。这是为什么呢？灯塔农业社每个劳动力负担耕地四点八亩，那三户富裕中农每个劳动力负担八点六亩，几乎相差一倍。合作社充分发挥了劳动力充足这个条件的作用，发展基本建设，统一使用土地，合理利用水利，实行多种经营，很快地创造了富裕中农想像不到的“奇迹”。“合作社人多势众力量大”，富裕中农最后不得不这样承认了。
    从上面的情况看来，为了迅速提高农业生产合作社的生产水平，农业社必须充分地发挥集体经营的优越性，克服各种缺点和不利条件。在这里，适当地增加合作社的公共积累，发展农业基本建设，有重大的意义。
    对于农业生产的发展，对于水利建设、肥料工业、农业机械工业以及其他促进农业发展的工业，国家在第二个五年计划期间将给予更多的注意。但是国家的投资只能放在那些带关键性的地方，决不可能解决一切问题。农业的发展必须主要依靠合作社本身的积累和本身的人力。适当地增加公共积累，不仅是合作社增加生产增加收入的可靠道路，而且是巩固集体所有制的物质基础。
    在合作社内增加公共积累、进行基本建设的先决条件，是恰当地解决消费同积累、个人同集体的矛盾，克服片面地追求个人利益和眼前利益，忽视集体利益和长远利益的偏向。在合作社建立初期，为了稳定社员的情绪，实行“少扣多分”的分配办法，较多地照顾社员改善生活的要求，这是正确的。现在多数社员的生活有了不同程度的改善，已经有更好的条件提出增加公共积累、发展基本建设的要求了。应该向广大社员说明白：合作社的多数成员是原来的贫农和下中农，“家底”很薄，所以一时不容易赶上富裕中农的生产水平。我们要用自己的手把“家底”尽快地建设起来，而不应该把全部收入分配掉了。今年积累一分，用来发展生产，明年可能收获两分或者三分。如果现在还不注意积累，不要说超过富裕中农的生产水平，有些合作社现有的生产水平也不容易保持。去年秋后，河北肥乡县西南庄社把绝大部分粮款分给社员；社员盖了九十多间新房，买了二十多辆自行车，当时都很高兴。可是，社里没有资金了，最后只好卖了两条骡子，勉强维持生产。照这样子干下去，生产水平哪能提高呢？和这种情形相反，武安县荣胜社打通了部分社员“只顾享受，不顾生产”的糊涂思想，准备在今年秋后把公积金由2.2％提高到8％，用来建筑一座小型扬水站和一座颗粒肥料厂。有了充足的水和肥料，从明年起，这个社的生产水平就能大大跃进一步。在生产水平和生活水平逐步提高的基础上，合作社适当地多积累一些，对生产有莫大的帮助；社员适当地少分配一些，对生活不会发生严重的影响。应该教育全体社员从大处着眼，积极支持这种作法。至于许多社员把生产的结果浪费在吃喝、婚丧、迷信、赌博等等方面，而不用来积累和储蓄，这种恶劣现象尤其必须用大力说服和纠正。
    合作社的基本建设应该有计划、有步骤地进行。根据多用力、少花钱的原则，首先举办关键性的建设项目。许多已经超过富裕中农生产水平的合作社，几乎都是由于集中力量解决了障碍生产发展的关键问题，特别是水利问题。在我国，水多患涝，水少苦旱，这是农业生产的主要敌人。只要把旱地改成水田，把涝灾彻底消灭，一下可以提高产量百分之几十到几倍。云南玉溪专区农民1957年的收入估计可比1952年增加108％，全部达到中农生活水平，最重要的原因就是发展水利，使二百零二万亩耕地中的一百一十八万亩变成了水地。合作社水利建设应以小型为主。它的效果大，收益快，用工多，花钱少，完全符合多数农业合作社劳力多、资金少的实际状况。农业增产是各种条件的综合效果。除了水利建设以外，别的基本建设项目，像整理土地、植树造林、养猪积肥、添买耕畜等等，也要在能力许可的范围以内，加紧进行，越多越好。
    为了在五年内赶上和超过富裕中农的生产水平，还要特别加强合作社的经营管理，贯彻民主办社、勤俭办社的方针。合作社是大规模群众性的集体经济组织，只要经营管理得好，把社员群众的劳动潜力充分发挥出来，把全社公有的生产资料用在最恰当的地方，不用多久就能赶上和超过富裕中农的生产水平。如果经营管理不善，就可能发生无人负责、纪律松弛和浪费人力、资金的现象。许多被富裕中农讥笑过的“穷棒子社”，在几年以内变成了比他们还要富裕的社，这中间并没有什么奥妙，只不过他们真正作到民主办社和勤俭办社罢了。许多富裕中农为了发家致富，总是起早睡晚，把一切劳力都用在生产上，把能节省的每一文钱都节省下来。合作社应该学习他们的这种勤劳俭朴的精神，健全自己的经营管理工作。中共中央今年9月14日发布了“关于做好农业合作社生产管理工作的指示”，系统地总结了几年来办社的经验，全面地规定了合作社经营管理的方针政策；把这个指示的精神真正贯彻到自己的日常工作中，多数合作社一定能在五年内赶上和超过富裕中农的生产水平。
    在五年内赶上和超过富裕中农的生产水平，这是今后农村工作的重大任务。我们建议省、市、自治区党委、地委、县委和各级人民委员会把这方面的情况作一次认真的检查，看看哪些农业社已经超过了当地富裕中农的生产水平？它们是怎样超过的？有什么经验可以推广？还有哪些农业社没有赶上当地富裕中农的生产水平，应该怎样才能赶上？这些要作出切实可行的规划，帮助它们分期分批地达到这个目的。
