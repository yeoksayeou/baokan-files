Congratulatory Telegram from Soviet Party and Government Leaders on the Eighth Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
To Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China
To Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China:

On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government, we extend our most sincere congratulations to you, our dear friends, and through you to the fraternal Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and the government of the People's Republic of China, and we wholeheartedly wish you new achievements in socialist construction.

The Chinese people are greeting this significant festival with the great victories they have achieved in their struggle for the realization of socialism. The national economy of the People's Republic of China is developing rapidly, and the first Five-Year Plan is being successfully completed. The resolute struggle against the right-wing elements who oppose socialism further strengthens the dictatorship of the proletariat and raises the political consciousness of the entire people.

The events taking place in our time constantly highlight the growing international prestige of the People's Republic of China and its enormous influence on world politics. The People's Republic of China has consistently opposed colonialism, advocated the complete national liberation of oppressed peoples of all nationalities, and has always cherished the good intention to cooperate with all countries, regardless of their social system.

The Soviet people are extremely pleased to see the fraternal friendship between the Soviet Union and China being consolidated and developed year by year. Our friendship is the most important factor in the socialist camp's powerful struggle for peace and progress, and it is also an outstanding example of fraternal cooperation between the two peoples in the cause of building a new life.

Glory to the great Chinese people – builders of socialism!

Warm fraternal greetings to the Communist Party of China and the government of the People's Republic of China, which lead six hundred million people along the road of socialism!

May the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China be increasingly consolidated and last forever!
          K. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet
          N. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
          N. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union
                                  Moscow, September 30, 1957
