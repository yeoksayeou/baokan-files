Hefei, October 29th (By our reporter) – Following the decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, Anhui provincial-level organs and prefectural and municipal Party committee organs are progressively entering the third phase of the rectification campaign. More than twenty units directly under the provincial authority have now entered the stage of rectifying work styles and improving work. In addition to previous deployments to organs directly under its authority, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a telephone conference of prefectural and municipal Party committee secretaries on the 25th to deploy the transition to the third phase of the rectification movement at the prefectural and municipal levels. At the telephone conference, the Provincial Party Committee pointed out that enhancing the understanding of rectification and overcoming ideological obstacles are prerequisites for ushering in a rectification upsurge in the rectification phase. The Provincial Party Committee believes that the current ideological obstacles among some leading cadres are: blind complacency stemming from the belief that problems have been resolved through the anti-Rightist struggle and concurrent rectification and improvement; a resistant attitude stemming from the fear of exposing shortcomings, losing prestige, and making work difficult to carry out and conclude; a negative and timid attitude stemming from the belief that the problems raised by the masses are numerous, involve a wide range of issues, and are inextricably intertwined; and a one-sided understanding that either overlooks the reasonable and correct aspects of the masses' opinions, focusing only on certain biased and one-sided opinions, or disregards the masses' opinions because they are deemed vague and abstract. Based on the situation in the province, the Provincial Party Committee also put forward requirements and methods for rectification. The current focus of rectification, based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report, is primarily to overcome tendencies towards sectarianism and special privileges. It is necessary to closely connect with the masses, promote a hard-working and simple style, and require leading cadres to participate in physical labor, etc.

    安徽各机关逐步转入整改阶段
    省委向地、市委布置整改的要求和做法
    本报合肥29日电　安徽省级机关和地、市委各机关在取得反右派斗争的决定性胜利后，逐步转入整风的第三阶段。现在省直属机关已有二十多个单位转入整顿作风改进工作阶段。中共安徽省委除在前一时期对直属机关作过布置外，并于25日召开地市委书记电话会议，对地、市一级整风运动转入第三阶段进行布置。在电话会议中省委指出，提高对整改的认识，克服思想障碍，是进入整改阶段掀起整改高潮的先决条件。省委认为，目前有些领导干部的思想障碍是：认为经过反右派斗争和边整边改，好像问题都解决了的盲目自满情绪；怕暴露缺点，丧失威信，工作不好做、不好收场的抵触情绪；认为群众提的问题多、牵涉面广、纠缠不清的消极畏难情绪；只看到群众某些偏激片面的意见，忽视了群众意见中合理的、正确的部分，或者认为群众所提意见笼统抽象，因而对群众意见不重视的片面认识。省委还根据本省情况提出了整改的要求和作法。目前整改的重点是，根据邓小平同志的报告精神，主要是克服宗派主义和特殊化的倾向。密切联系群众，发扬艰苦朴素的作风，领导干部要参加体力劳动等。
