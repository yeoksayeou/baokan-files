The Rhee Syngman Clique Acknowledges Thieves as Fathers, Bringing Disaster to the People
U.S. Military Repeatedly Kills People Wantonly in South Korea

　　This newspaper provides a comprehensive report: According to Xinhua News Agency, recently, the U.S. invading army in Korea has continuously committed murder in Incheon, Busan, Gunsan, Seoul and other places, causing widespread anger among the people of South Korea.

　　Under these circumstances, the atrocities of the U.S. military beating and wounding South Koreans continue to emerge endlessly.

　　On October 3, U.S. military police Bailey shot and killed Sun Zhongyuan (transliteration), a 15-year-old South Korean student, for no reason in Qingquan, near Daegu. On the same day, another American soldier named Wooding shot and killed Kim Hok-ki (transliteration), an elderly woman of sixty, in Paju-ri, Gyeonggi-do. Wooding was hunting pheasants at the time but shot Kim Hok-ki, who was behind the forest. On October 5, near the U.S. military base Camp Casey, U.S. soldier Leonard Smith shot and killed Lee Jung-soon (transliteration), a 23-year-old South Korean woman, and wounded Jung Ok-seon (transliteration), a 50-year-old woman, in the left arm.

　　Five newspapers in South Korea published commentaries strongly protesting against the U.S. military police Bailey for shooting and killing Sun Zhongyuan for no reason. These newspapers demanded that Bailey be handed over to the South Korean authorities for trial and that the United States agree to sign an agreement with the South Korean authorities on the status of the U.S. invading forces in Korea.

　　The Seoul "Chosun Ilbo" editorial said that Koreans cannot endlessly endure the humiliation imposed on them by these constantly occurring incidents. The newspaper expressed regret that the United States had no intention of accepting the Rhee Syngman regime's request to conclude an administrative agreement stipulating the legal status of the U.S. troops stationed there.

　　Another Seoul newspaper, "Hankook Ilbo," said that the biggest reason for the continuous occurrence of U.S. soldiers shooting South Koreans is that U.S. military courts do not seriously punish offending U.S. soldiers. "Hankook Ilbo" specifically pointed out that the U.S. soldier who shot and killed a three-year-old South Korean child in Incheon a few weeks ago only received a sentence of three months of hard labor.

　　According to United Press International, several South Korean newspapers believe that the atrocities of U.S. soldiers in South Korea are caused by racial discrimination, just like the recent Little Rock incident of discrimination against black people in the United States.

　　Under the protest of South Korean public opinion, Rhee Syngman's Foreign Minister Cho Jeong-hwan said at a press conference on the 5th that the Rhee Syngman group had made an "oral protest" to the United States regarding the incident of U.S. military police Bailey shooting and killing Sun Zhongyuan. According to him, the South Korean authorities will also lodge a formal protest with the U.S. government regarding this incident.

    李承晚集团认贼作父祸延百姓
    美军在南朝鲜接连无故杀人
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：最近一个时期以来，侵朝美军在仁川、釜山、群山、汉城等地连续制造了杀人事件。引起了南朝鲜人民的普遍愤怒。
    在这种情况下，美军打死和打伤南朝鲜人的暴行，仍然层出不穷。
    10月3日，美军宪兵贝利在大丘附近的清泉地方无故开枪打死一个十五岁的南朝鲜学生孙中元（译音）。同一天，另一个名叫伍丁的美国兵，又在京畿道坡洲里将六十岁的老妇金霍姬（译音）击毙。伍丁当时在打野鸡，但是却将丛林后面的金霍姬打死了。10月5日，在美国军事基地凯西营附近，美国兵兰纳德·史密斯开枪打死二十三岁的南朝鲜妇女李贞顺（译音），并打伤了五十岁的郑玉善（译音）的左臂。
    南朝鲜的五家报纸都发表了评论，激烈抗议美国宪兵贝利无故开枪打死孙中元。这些报纸要求把贝利移交给南朝鲜当局审讯，并且要求美国同意同南朝鲜当局签订关于侵朝美军地位问题的协定。
    汉城“朝鲜日报”社论说，朝鲜人不能无止境地忍受这种不断发生的事件所加于他们的屈辱。这家报纸对于美国毫无接受李承晚政权关于缔结规定美国驻军法律地位的行政协定这一要求的意思一事，表示遗憾。
    汉城另一家报纸“韩国日报”说，美国兵开枪射击南朝鲜人的事件连续发生的最大原因是美国军事法庭并不认真处分犯罪的美国兵。“韩国日报”特别指出，几个星期前在仁川开枪打死一个三岁的南朝鲜儿童的美国兵只受到了三个月苦役的处分。
    据合众社报道，有几家南朝鲜报纸认为，美国兵在南朝鲜的暴行是从种族歧视引起的，这同美国国内最近发生的歧视黑人的小石城事件一样。
    在南朝鲜舆论的抗议下，李承晚的外务部长官曹正焕5日在记者招待会上说，李承晚集团已就美国宪兵贝利枪杀孙中元的事件，向美国方面提出了“口头抗议”。据他说，南朝鲜当局还将就这次事件向美国政府提出正式抗议。
