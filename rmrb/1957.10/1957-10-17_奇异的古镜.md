A Curious Ancient Mirror

    This is the front and back of a Han Dynasty "magic" mirror. The front is smooth and can reflect a person's face. The back has eight Chinese characters: "见日之光、天下大明" (jiàn rì zhī guāng, tiān xià dà míng - roughly: "See the light of the sun, the world is greatly illuminated") and some patterned designs. What's curious is that this ancient mirror has no trace of rust, and if you put it in sunlight, you can see a projection on the ceiling or wall that is identical to the pattern on its back. This ancient mirror was presented to the state by Mr. Jin Gongzhi of the Shanghai Museum of Culture and History, who has treasured it for decades. (Attached picture)

　　奇异的古镜
    这是汉代一个透光古镜的正反面，正面光洁，可映人脸。反面有“见日之光、天下大明”八个汉字和一些图案花纹。奇异的是这个古镜毫无锈蚀痕迹，而且如果将它放在阳光下就可以在天花板或墙壁上看到一个和它背面相同的投影。这古镜是上海文史馆靳巩志先生献给国家的，他已珍藏了数十年。（附图片）
