Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: Today, the *Liberation Army Daily* published an editorial entitled "The Great Program for Agricultural Development," calling on all officers and soldiers to do their utmost to support farmers nationwide and strive to realize the "National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) from 1956 to 1967."

The editorial said: "The vast majority of our officers and soldiers come from rural areas, and after we retire, we will mainly return to rural areas to settle down and build our careers. Therefore, the Agricultural Development Program has a close relationship with us. Every one of our officers and soldiers should not only seriously study this program, but also do their utmost to support farmers nationwide and strive to realize this program."

The editorial suggested that the entire army take advantage of the opportunity of the publication and discussion of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program to review and summarize the implementation of the "Twenty Articles of the General Political Department's Implementation Plan on the Army's Participation in and Support of the Agricultural Cooperation Movement and Agricultural Production" issued in February 1956, and on this basis, greatly advance the work of supporting agriculture.

    认真阅读农业发展纲要
    尽最大努力支援农民
    “解放军报”向全军发出号召
    据新华社26日讯　今天解放军报以“发展农业的伟大纲领”为题发表社论，号召全军官兵尽最大努力支援全国农民，为实现“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）”而奋斗。
    社论说：“我们全军官兵，绝大部分是来自农村，我们退役之后，主要的也是要回到农村安家立业。因此，农业发展纲要对我们来说，有着切身的关系。我们每一个官兵，不仅要认真阅读这个纲要，而且要尽最大的努力支援全国农民，为实现这个纲要而奋斗。”
    社论建议全军趁此全国农业发展纲要修正草案公布讨论的时机，检查总结一下1956年2月总政治部发布的“关于军队参加和支援农业合作化运动及农业生产的实施方案”二十条的执行情况，并在这个基础上，把支援农业的工作，大大地向前推进一步。
