Enterprise Big-Character Posters

Editor's Note: In recent days, employees of the Beijing Electron Tube Factory have focused their debate on the issue of apprentices. Participants include apprentices, young workers, experienced workers, and office staff. The main points of contention are roughly as follows: 1. Can the lives of apprentices be compared with those in the old society? 2. Should we compare with farmers? 3. Should we compare with veteran workers? 4. Are the State Council's regulations on extending the apprenticeship period beneficial? The following is a portion of the big-character posters from this factory regarding the apprentice issue.

	Will the Excessive Disparity Between Workers' and Peasants' Lives Affect the Worker-Peasant Alliance?
	I don't think so.
	Will the rapid promotion of apprentices affect the worker-peasant alliance? I don't think so. Our country's construction is centered on heavy industry, and agriculture is only developing accordingly. A worker creates much more wealth in a year than a farmer. If we compare factories with rural areas, our country will never become an advanced industrial nation. The reason our agriculture can develop is inseparable from the factories supplying farmers with agricultural tools, fertilizers, and various equipment, but the industrial raw materials produced by farmers still cannot meet the needs of factories. If every farmer recognizes this, they will not be uneasy about production, will not be dissatisfied with workers earning more wages, and of course, there will be no problem affecting the worker-peasant alliance.

	We Should Think About the Peasants
	Chen Quanxing said: Farmers create less value, so they should earn less money and concentrate on production, while you create more value, so you should earn more wages. May I ask, if there were no state investment in building modern factories, and no state cultivation, how much value could an apprentice create with just a pair of hands and a brain? This sum of money from the state was created by our veteran workers and peasant brothers. Apprentices have not done much work since entering the factory and have not contributed much to the country, but their wages are much higher than the income of farmers. Of course, this will cause dissatisfaction among farmers. If you and other junior high school graduates in the countryside went to participate in agricultural production, you would probably say: Why is the income so disparate for the same junior high school students? Why don't you consider the impact on the worker-peasant alliance when you earn more wages? Is this the selfless spirit that a member of the working class should have?

	Active Production Is Not Just For Money
	It is true that our country's construction is centered on heavy industry, but if farmers do not provide enough food and industrial raw materials, it will be impossible to develop industry. You say, "A worker creates much more wealth in a year than a farmer. If we compare factories with rural areas, our country will never become an advanced industrial nation." Are you saying that if the country asks our workers to look at the lives of farmers and tells workers that their lives cannot be improved too quickly, workers will lose their enthusiasm for labor? And that our country will not become an advanced industrial nation! Was the overfulfillment of our country's first Five-Year Plan because the state bought the enthusiasm of the working class with money?

	Chen Quanxing, you are wrong. Our working class works actively and strives hard not for money. The reason why farmers currently create less wealth is precisely because the production and labor conditions are poor, and there is no advanced machinery. If you were producing in the countryside and the wages of workers and peasants were very different, what would you think?

### 工农生活过于悬殊会不会影响工农联盟？

专栏：企业里的大字报

    编者按　最近几天，北京电子管厂的职工集中在徒工问题上展开了辩论。参加辩论的除了徒工、青工，还有老师傅、科室人员。争论的焦点大体有以下几个方面：1、徒工生活能不能同旧社会比？2、要不要同农民比？3、该不该和老工人比？4、国务院关于延长徒工转正的规定有没有好处。下面是这个厂关于徒工问题的大字报的一部分。
　　工农生活过于悬殊会不会影响工农联盟？
    我看不会
    徒工晋级快会不会影响工农联盟呢？我看不会。我们国家的建设是以重工业为中心的，农业只不过是相应地发展。一个工人一年所创造的财富比一个农民所创造的多得多。要工厂和农村比，我们的国家就永远不会成为先进的工业国。我国的农业所以能够发展，是和工厂里供应农民农具、肥料、各种设备分不开的，但农民所生产出来的工业原料到现在还不能满足工厂的需要。要是每个农民都认识到这一点，就不会不安心生产，就不会对工人多拿工资不满，当然也不会发生什么影响工农联盟的问题。　　十号车间　陈全兴
    应该想想农民
    陈全兴说：农民创造的价值低，就应该少拿钱，安心生产，而你创造的价值高，就应该多拿工资。请问，如果没有国家投资盖现代化的工厂，没有国家的培养，徒工一双手、一个脑袋，又能创造多少价值？国家的这笔资金，就是我们的老工人和农民兄弟创造的。徒工刚进厂工作没做多少，对国家贡献不大，工资就比农民的劳动收入多得很多，当然会引起农民的不满。如果你和其他在农村的初中毕业生一块去参加农业生产，你大概会讲：同样的初中生，为什么收入这样悬殊？你为什么多得工资就不考虑影响工农联盟？难道这是作为工人阶级的一员应有的大公无私精神吗？

    积极生产并非为钱
    不错，我们国家的建设是以重工业为中心的，但要是没有农民供给足够的粮食和工业原料，就无法发展工业。你说“一个工人一年所创造的财富比一个农民所创造的多的多。要工厂和农村比，我们的国家就永远不会成为先进的工业国。”难道说国家要我们工人看一下农民的生活，要工人生活不能提得太快，工人就会没有劳动积极性？我们的国家也就不会成为先进的工业国！难道我国第一个五年计划超额完成，是因为国家用金钱收买了工人阶级的积极性吗？
    陈全兴，你想错了。我们工人阶级积极生产，努力劳动不是为了金钱。目前农民创造的财富少，正是因为生产劳动条件差，没有先进的机器。如果你在农村生产，工人农民的工资相差很远，你会怎样想呢？
