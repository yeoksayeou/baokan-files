Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 13th: Many industrial enterprises in Chengdu are relying on the masses to solve the problems raised during the rectification movement.

The first batch of industrial enterprises in Chengdu to carry out the rectification movement have attached great importance to rectifying while rectifying since the great blooming and contending began in mid-September. However, in many units, the rectification work initially relied only on a few full-time personnel from the rectification organization. Everything from copying big-character posters, collecting and summarizing, conducting investigations, to proposing plans was done by these people. As a result, the rectification work once lagged far behind the blooming and contending. By the end of September, workers in some units had put forward thousands of opinions, while only a few dozen had been improved.

In order to change this situation, the units successively changed their practices. In addition to the factory-wide rectification organization, basic-level units such as the factory's departments and workshops also took the initiative to improve their work, dividing the scope according to the nature of the opinions and categorizing them: factory-wide problems were directly led and handled by the factory's Party committee, while problems belonging to various departments were copied, collected, and studied by the departments themselves, and those that could be solved were solved immediately. In the process of handling opinions, the units adopted a variety of methods, such as holding forums with the people who raised the opinions, meetings of relevant workers, and soliciting individual opinions, to mobilize the masses to work together.

Because the mass line was implemented, problems were solved quickly and well. A batch of dormitories in the Southwest Radio Equipment Factory needed to be allocated, and a satisfactory plan could not be put forward for a long time. This time, it was quickly resolved after joint research by the relevant workers.

At present, many units are preparing to convene a workers' representative conference to focus on solving some larger factory-wide problems and further push the rectification work to a climax.

### 成都许多企业依靠群众进行整改

　　成都许多企业依靠群众进行整改
    据新华社成都13日电　成都市许多工业企业依靠群众解决整风中提出的问题。
    成都市第一批开展整风运动的工业企业，从9月中大鸣大放以来，都十分重视边整边改工作。但不少单位的整改工作最初只依靠了整改机构的少数专职人员，从抄大字报、汇集归纳、调查研究以至提出方案都是这些人，因而一度发生整改远远落后于鸣放的情况。9月下旬，有的单位职工提出的意见已经上千件，而改进的还只有几十件。
    为了改变这个情况，各单位先后改变了作法。除全厂性的整顿机构以外，各厂的科室、车间等基层单位也都主动改进工作，按照意见的性质划分范围，分类归口：全厂性的问题由厂的党委会直接领导负责处理，属于各部门的由各部门自行抄录、收集、研究，能解决的立即解决。在处理意见过程中，各单位采取了召开提意见人座谈会、有关职工会、个别征求意见等多种多样的方式，发动群众一起动手。
    由于贯彻群众路线，使问题解决得又快又好。西南无线电器材厂有一批宿舍需要分配，始终提不出各方面满意的方案，这次经过有关职工共同研究很快就得到解决。
    目前，许多单位正准备召开职工代表大会，集中解决一些全厂性的较大的问题，把整改工作进一步推向高潮。
