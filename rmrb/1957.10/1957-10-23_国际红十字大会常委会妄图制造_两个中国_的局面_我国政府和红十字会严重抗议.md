Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The 19th International Red Cross Conference will be held in New Delhi, India, from October 28th to November 7th. According to the regulations of the International Red Cross Conference charter, representatives of governments that are parties to the Geneva Conventions and national Red Cross societies recognized by these governments have the right to participate in this conference. In addition to countries such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Germany, Albania, Yugoslavia, North Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia that have already been invited to attend this conference, there are also Asian and African countries such as India, Egypt, and Syria, as well as Western countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. In order to participate in this conference, the Chinese government and the Red Cross Society of China have formed a government delegation headed by Pan Zili, with Gong Pusheng, Fu Hao, and Shao Tianren as members, and a Red Cross delegation headed by Li Dequan, with Wu Yunfu, Hu Lansheng, Peng Yan, Liang Siyi, and Ji Feng as members. Our delegation has left Beijing for New Delhi. However, the Standing Committee of the International Red Cross Conference, which is responsible for the preparation of the conference, has invited both our government and the Red Cross Society of China to participate in this conference, and has also invited elements of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the so-called "Taiwan government" and "Taiwan Red Cross Society." Regarding the Standing Committee's behavior of treating Taiwan Province of China as an independent country and a local Red Cross Society of China as an independent Red Cross Society, thus creating a "two Chinas" situation, the Chinese government and the Red Cross Society of China have lodged a serious protest with the Standing Committee of the International Red Cross Conference, demanding that the invitation to the Chiang Kai-shek clique elements be revoked, and solemnly stated that the Chinese government and the Red Cross Society of China will absolutely not allow international conferences to create a "two Chinas" situation under any name, and that the Chinese government and the Red Cross Society of China will never attend international conferences in which the Chiang Kai-shek clique participates.

    国际红十字大会常委会妄图制造“两个中国”的局面
    我国政府和红十字会严重抗议
    新华社22日讯　第十九届国际红十字大会将于10月28日到11月7日在印度新德里召开。根据国际红十字大会章程规定，日内瓦公约参加国的政府和经这些国家的政府承认的全国性红十字会的代表，都有权参加这次大会。已被邀请出席这次大会的除苏、中、波、捷、匈、保、罗、德、阿尔巴尼亚、南、朝、越、蒙等国外，还有印、埃、叙等亚非国家和美、英等西方国家。中国政府和红十字会为了参加这次大会，业已组成以潘自力为团长，龚普生、符浩、邵天任为团员的政府代表团和以李德全为团长，伍云甫、胡兰生、彭炎、梁思懿、纪锋为团员的红十字会代表团。我国代表团已离开北京去新德里。但负责大会筹备工作的国际红十字大会常设委员会一方面邀请我国政府和我国红十字会参加这次大会，一方面竟然又邀请了所谓“台湾政府”和“台湾红十字会”的蒋介石集团分子。对于常设委员会这种把中国台湾省作为一个独立国家，把中国的一个地方性红十字会作为一个独立红十字会看待而制造“两个中国”的行为，中国政府和中国红十字会已经向国际红十字大会常设委员会提出严重抗议，要求撤销对蒋介石集团分子的邀请，并严正表示中国政府和中国红十字会也绝对不允许国际会议以任何名义制造“两个中国”的局面，中国政府和红十字会决不出席有蒋介石集团参加的国际会议。
