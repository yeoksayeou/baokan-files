According to a report from the New Hunan Daily: The Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the spirit of the Party's Third Plenary Session, has set the central requirement for developing agricultural production next year: to increase the total grain output from 5.8 billion jin this year to 6.2 billion jin, to increase the total rapeseed production by 108%, to increase the total number of live pigs by 35.8%, and to afforest and reclaim 1.5 million mu of oil-tea camellia forests, with corresponding development of other economic and technical crops.

To welcome the upcoming production upsurge next year, the Prefectural Committee has put forward six specific measures: 1. Large-scale construction of farmland water conservancy, to ensure that next year will be free from or less affected by natural disasters, is an important component of the production upsurge this winter and next spring. It is required that the entire region build more than 200,000 various water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, rationally irrigate 4.09 million mu of farmland, control soil erosion over an area of 100 square kilometers, and increase the horsepower of pumping stations by 2,450. In the lake area, the focus is on repair, requiring the completion of 9.45 million cubic meters of earthwork and 18 water inlet culverts. 2. Resolve the fertilizer problem. It is required that the area planted with green manure in the entire region be expanded from 3 million mu this year to 5 million mu; and continue to promote the fertilizer accumulation experience of Liling throughout the region, appropriately increasing the supply of chemical fertilizers in severely fertilizer-deficient areas. 3. On the premise of solving water conservancy problems and fully tapping production potential, appropriately expand the area of continuous double-cropping rice. It is required that the entire region expand the double-cropping rice area from 5.3 million mu this year to 5.6 million mu, of which the area of continuous late rice should be expanded by 1 million mu compared to this year. 4. After harvesting the 1.2 million mu of single-season early rice in the entire region, strive to plant high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes and corn as much as possible. 5. Vigorously improve low-yield fields. At present, the entire region has about 3 million mu of low-yield fields, with an average annual output of only about 200 to 300 jin per mu. After improvement through methods such as opening ditches, draining waterlogging, carrying soil, and increasing the application of organic fertilizers, the output can generally be increased by 100 to 200 jin per mu. 6. Summarize the masses' production experience, and continue to vigorously promote various advanced cultivation techniques through methods such as running training courses, organizing exhibitions, and visits.

In order to ensure the thorough implementation of the above measures, the Prefectural Committee requires leaders at all levels and all cadres to conscientiously criticize and overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, conscientiously summarize the experience and lessons learned in leading agricultural production in the past two years after agricultural cooperativization, deeply study production, and strengthen leadership. When planning next year's production, each county should also, according to the specific conditions of each locality, separately propose plans to catch up with or exceed the production level of well-to-do middle peasants within a few years as the guiding ideology for all cadres and the "goal" for the broad masses. In addition, the Prefectural Committee also requires all relevant departments in the region to arrange all work from the perspective of supporting agricultural production.

    根据三中全会精神贯彻农业发展纲要
    克服右倾思想挖掘农业潜力
    本报讯　据新湖南报消息：把明年的粮食总产量由今年的五十八亿斤提高到六十二亿斤，油菜总产量增长108％，生猪总头数增长35.8％，造林和垦复油茶林一百五十万亩，其它经济技术作物也都相应发展。这是中共湘潭地委根据党的三中全会的精神，对明年发展农业生产的中心要求。
    为了迎接明年生产高潮，地委提出了六大具体措施：1、大规模兴修农田水利，保证明年不受或少受自然灾害，是今冬明春生产高潮中的一个重要组成部分。要求全区今冬明春修建各种水利工程共达二十万处以上，进行合理灌溉的田亩四百零九万亩，控制水土流失面积一百平方公里，增加抽水机站马力二千四百五十匹。湖区以内修为主，要求完成土方九百四十五万公方，进水涵闸十八座。2、解决肥料问题。要求全区种植绿肥面积由今年的三百万亩扩大到五百万亩；并在全区继续推广醴陵的积肥经验，在严重缺肥的地区，适当增加化学肥料的供应。3、在解决水利问题和充分挖掘生产潜力的前提下，适当扩大连作双季稻面积，要求全区把双季稻田由今年的五百三十万亩，扩大到五百六十万亩，其中连作晚稻比今年扩大一百万亩。4、在全区一百二十万亩一季早稻收割后，尽量争取种上红薯、玉米等高产作物。5、大力改良低产田。目前全区约有低产田三百万亩，这些田的常年产量平均每亩只有二、三百斤左右，通过开圳、排渍、挑土、增施有机肥料等办法加以改良后，一般每亩可增产一、二百斤。6、总结群众生产经验，通过办训练班、组织展览、参观等办法，继续大力推广各种先进耕作技术。
    为了保证上述措施的彻底实现，地委要求各级领导和全体干部必须认真批判和克服右倾保守思想，认真总结农业合作化后两年来领导农业生产的经验教训，深入钻研生产，加强领导，各县在规划明年生产时，还要根据各地具体情况，分别提出在几年内赶上或超过富裕中农的生产水平的计划作为全体干部的指导思想和广大群众的“奔头”。此外，地委还要求全区各有关部门必须从支援农业生产的观点出发来安排各项工作。
