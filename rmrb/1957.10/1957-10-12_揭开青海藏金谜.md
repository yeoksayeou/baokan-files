    Unveiling the Mystery of Hidden Gold in Qinghai

    (Our report) Three gold mine prospecting teams, tasked with unveiling the mystery of hidden gold on the Qinghai Plateau, are conducting prospecting work on the southern slope of the Qilian Mountains, along the Datong River, the Yeniu Gou River, and along the Yellow River in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.

    Since May of this year, they have surveyed 500 square kilometers of placer gold-bearing areas, collected more than 2,000 ore samples, and delineated five mining areas ready for formal exploration.

    According to local chronicles and inscriptions, people have been panning for placer gold along the Yellow River, the Huangshui River, and the Datong River for more than a hundred years. Traces of digging and gold panning can be found in many valleys and along the rivers.

    从今年5月以来，他们已经勘查了五百平方公里蕴藏砂金的地区，采了两千多个矿样，划定了五个准备正式勘探的矿区。
    据地方志和碑记所载，黄河、湟水、大通河沿岸在一百多年以前就有很多人淘采砂金，许多山谷和河流沿岸，都有挖砂淘金的痕迹。
