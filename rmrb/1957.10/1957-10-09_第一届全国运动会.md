    The earliest National Games in China were held in October of the third year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty (1911). At that time, it was called the "First Sports League of National School Divisions." Later, for the sake of easy reference, it was renamed the First National Games. All participants in this games were students. At that time, they were divided into five regions: North China, Wuhan, Wu Ning (Suzhou, Nanjing), Shanghai, and South China. There were 140 athletes participating in the competition, with the Shanghai team alone having 40 athletes. Athletes from various regions wore different colored ribbons to distinguish themselves during the competition.
    The sports events included only track and field, football, basketball, and tennis. During the competition, they were divided into higher group, secondary group, and national school joint competition groups. There were no restrictions on participating in the higher or secondary group competitions, and athletes could choose freely. The schools participating in the national school joint competition were St. John's University, Nanyang Public School, Tianjin YMCA Day School, Wuchang Wenhua University, Tianjin Industrial School, and Xiehe College.
    The results of this games were very low. The first place in high jump was five feet four inches, and the first place in pole vault was nine feet eight inches. As a result of the competition, the Shanghai region won first place with 52 points, and St. John's University won the championship in the joint school competition. Professor Ma John, then a student at St. John's University, represented the Shanghai team and the St. John's University team in the competition, winning second place in the 880-yard race nationally and first place in the 880-yard race and third place in the 440-yard race in the joint school competition.
    The most interesting event in this games was the tennis competition. The winners in the preliminary round were Pan Wenbing, Ma John, Lin Quancheng, and Xu Jun. At that time, because it was late, the semi-finals could not be held. The referees believed that these four were all students of St. John's University, so they ordered them to return to school and hold their own competition on another day.
    This is the general situation of the first National Games in our country.

    第一届全国运动会
    我国最早的一届全国运动会，是在清宣统二年（1911年）10月举行的。当时，叫做全国学校区分队第一次体育同盟。后来为了便于称呼，才改称第一届全国运动会。参加这次运动会的都是学生。当时分华北、武汉、吴宁（苏州、南京）、上海、华南五个区，参加比赛的运动员有一百四十人，其中仅上海队的运动员就有四十人。参加比赛的各地区的运动员在比赛时佩带各色标带以示区别。
    运动会的项目只有田径、足球、篮球、网球四项。比赛时，分高等组、中等组和全国学校联合比赛三组，参加高等组或中等组比赛没有限制，可由运动员自由选择。参加全国各学校联合比赛的是圣约翰大学、南洋公学、天津青年会日校、武昌文华大学、天津工业学校和协和文书院六所学校。
    这次运动会的成绩非常低，跳高第一名的成绩是五呎四吋，撑竿跳第一名的成绩是九呎八吋。比赛结果，上海区以五十二分获得了第一名，圣约翰大学获得了各学校联合比赛的冠军。马约翰老教授当时是圣约翰大学的学生，代表上海队和圣约翰大学队参加了比赛，取得了八百八十码全国第二名和各学校联合比赛中的八百八十码的第一名和四百四十码第三名。
    这次运动会中，最有趣的是网球比赛。在预赛中获得优胜的是潘文炳、马约翰、林全诚、许君四人。当时因天色已晚不能举行复赛，裁判员认为这四人都是圣约翰大学学生，因此令他们回校后再择日自行比赛。
    这就是我国第一届全国运动会的一般情况。　（安）
