Rectifying Backward Cooperatives Through Great Debate

Backward cooperatives are called third-category cooperatives in some places, and backward cooperatives in others. Regardless of what they are called, they refer to some agricultural production cooperatives that are not well-managed. Among the hundreds of thousands of agricultural cooperatives nationwide, these cooperatives account for a small proportion. There is no doubt that the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives are well-managed or relatively well-managed; otherwise, it would be incomprehensible that agriculture has continued to increase production year after year and that rural areas have remained stable and prosperous, despite the major disasters last year and the minor disasters this year.

It has been less than two years since the basic realization of agricultural cooperation in the country, and the newly established agricultural cooperatives are still undergoing a gradual consolidation process. The vast majority of agricultural cooperatives are on an upward trend after multiple rectifications, developing vigorously; a small number, however, have fallen behind, stagnated, or even disintegrated due to various reasons. In the process of development, there are always relatively advanced and relatively backward elements, which is not a strange thing, but a normal phenomenon. One of the major responsibilities of leaders is to continuously promote and help the backward to catch up with the advanced. In this process, new relatively advanced and relatively backward elements will emerge. Then, promote and help the backward to move forward again. In this way, society can continue to develop. We cannot view backward cooperatives with an absolutely fixed perspective. There will always be backward cooperatives, but their meaning will vary in different periods. The current backward cooperatives will not always be backward; the question is what methods are used to lead them.

What kind of agricultural cooperatives are the current backward cooperatives? The situation varies from place to place. Generally speaking, these cooperatives have poor production, reduced output, or a relatively large number of members have reduced income, or although there has been no reduction in output, they cannot complete the grain purchase tasks; the ideological education work in the cooperatives is very poor, the enthusiasm of members and cooperative cadres is not high, and a considerable number of people are busy engaging in capitalist activities such as commercial speculation, grain black market, and usury; the leadership of the cooperatives has fallen into the hands of wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas, or even into the hands of some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, or the cooperative cadres are relatively weak and are besieged or eroded by reactionary forces inside and outside the cooperative; due to lack of experience, the management of these cooperatives is also relatively chaotic, or ideologically biased, and the policy of mutual benefit has not been implemented. As a result, there are often disturbances in the cooperatives, and some members want to withdraw or have already withdrawn. From these situations, it can be seen that the main reason why the current backward cooperatives are backward is that capitalist ideology occupies a dominant position in these cooperatives, and even the remnant feudal forces have not been eliminated.

How can the situation in these agricultural cooperatives be changed? Many facts have already answered this question. The best way is to have a led, big airing of views and big contending, and to carry out a great debate. Only when the airing of views is thorough can the debate be detailed, and can many ideological and work problems be solved, so that backward cooperatives can get rid of their backward state. The experience of Shayuan Cooperative in Qujiang County, Guangdong, published in this newspaper on September 25, the experience of Qixin Cooperative in Yongji County, Jilin, published today, and the experiences of many other places, all prove this with vivid facts.

We must never be afraid of carrying out a great debate in backward cooperatives. The foundation of backward cooperatives is already weak; will they collapse after a big airing of views and a big contending? The evil atmosphere in backward cooperatives is already relatively strong; will it become even stronger after a big airing of views and a big contending? Will the masses' thinking become more confused because of a big airing of views and a big contending? What should we do if we cannot win the argument or convince others? What if the fire burns us? These concerns are completely unnecessary.

No matter when and where, we should have full and firm confidence in the justice of our socialist cause and in the wisdom and strength of the majority of the masses. The facts of Shayuan and other cooperatives prove that even the opinions expressed by the members of backward cooperatives during the big airing of views and big contending are mostly correct and conducive to solving various problems; and most members can distinguish between wrong opinions. During the big airing of views and big contending, some people with strong capitalist ideas will indeed become arrogant, and some people with vague ideas will indeed show wavering or pessimism and disappointment; however, as long as the great debate unfolds, the righteous spirit will quickly rise, and the evil atmosphere will quickly retreat. The basic team of socialism is growing and expanding at an unprecedented rate in such struggles.

In backward cooperatives, capitalist ideas are inherently more prominent; members inherently have opinions about the poor management of the cooperatives. A big airing of views and a big contending simply allows everyone to bring the words they discuss in the sorghum fields and tea houses to the discussion meetings, group meetings, and debate meetings; so that the cadres can hear and see what they could not hear and see in the past, and so that the people and their activities who oppose socialism under various disguises in the past can reveal their true colors. What's wrong with that? Let the dark corners be exposed to sunlight, so they will no longer become moldy. Didn't the bad elements in Daquan Cooperative in Huo County spread rumors that "the cooperative director is corrupt" to incite members to make trouble? Bring it to the table for discussion, and the rumors immediately disappeared. What if the cooperative cadres really have problems? We shouldn't be afraid even more. The more you cover it up, the more suspicious the members become. It is best to take the initiative to review and guarantee correction. What's wrong with letting such "fire" burn yourself and burn off the dirt on your body? True gold is not afraid of fire; the more it is refined, the purer it becomes. What about fake gold? It should not be allowed to pass off as genuine in the first place. Whether it is true or false, the masses will eventually be able to see it clearly.

Of course, it should be noted that strong leadership is necessary to carry out a great debate in backward cooperatives. The great debate in any agricultural cooperative should be conducted under leadership; this is even more necessary in backward cooperatives. The more backward the cooperative, the stronger the work team that should be sent. After the work team arrives at the backward cooperative, it should first solve the ideological problems of party members and league members, so that grassroots cadres and cooperative cadres understand the significance and steps of the whole-people rectification campaign, dispel concerns, and first conduct a big airing of views and a big contending within the party and the league, and basically unify the thinking of party members and league members through debate. On this basis, further clarify the political ideology and class composition of party members and league members, in order to cultivate activists, strengthen the leadership backbone, and establish a reliable leadership force. This leadership force should be composed of party members, league members, and activists among poor and lower-middle peasants. At the same time, it is necessary to rely on grassroots party organizations to comprehensively understand and analyze the class situation and ideological trends of the entire village and cooperative. One of the characteristics of backward cooperatives is the lack of a strong basic team of socialism. Therefore, special attention should be paid to cultivating activists and strengthening the backbone force with considerable effort before the great debate is launched in the entire village and cooperative. This force, which plays a backbone role, should basically be composed of party members, league members, and activists among poor and lower-middle peasants.

Generally speaking, backward cooperatives also have another characteristic: the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and the contradictions among the people are relatively sharp, and they are mixed together; capitalist activities are relatively serious, and there are many shortcomings in the work of the cooperative. In the big airing of views and the big contending, in addition to being vigilant against the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements at all times, attention should be paid to distinguishing the members' opinions on improving work from the reactionary remarks that fundamentally oppose the socialist system, distinguishing some doubts arising from a lack of understanding of the situation from malicious attacks, and distinguishing the general erroneous words and deeds of wealthy middle peasants from the counter-revolutionary activities of landlords and rich peasants, and treating them with different attitudes and different methods. On the one hand, the cadres leading the rectification campaign should pay attention to these distinctions; on the other hand, they should also pay attention to educating the masses to understand these distinctions. Backward cooperatives are not well-managed for complex reasons; but in summary, there are only three aspects: the sabotage of capitalist forces, the low awareness of members, and the errors and shortcomings in the work of cooperative cadres. First of all, we should not confuse these three aspects of problems with the socialist system; secondly, these three aspects of problems should not be confused with each other. In this way, it is easier to distinguish right from wrong and solve problems. Various erroneous thoughts among members should be criticized in various appropriate ways, and errors and shortcomings in the work of cooperative cadres must also be resolutely corrected. In the process of the great debate, those that can be changed should be changed while rectifying; after the great debate is over, more efforts should be concentrated to systematically do a good job of the rectification work in accordance with the three instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on improving the work of agricultural cooperatives.

The rectification of backward cooperatives should be regarded as the focus of the rectification work of cooperatives. This is not only because backward cooperatives especially need vigorous rectification; but also because the richest experience in the rectification of cooperatives can be obtained in the work of rectifying backward cooperatives. The progress of backward cooperatives will also have a great impetus to general cooperatives. It is hoped that every county party secretary can go to one or several backward cooperatives to directly lead the rectification work of cooperatives; doing this work well is of great significance for changing the face of the entire countryside.

### 经过大辩论整顿落后社

    经过大辩论整顿落后社
    落后社，有的地方叫做三类社，也有的叫做后进社。不论叫它什么名称，总之，说的是办得不好的一些农业生产合作社。在全国几十万个农业社里，这类社占的比例很小。毫无疑问，绝大多数农业社是办得很好或者较好的；不然，在去年曾经遭了大灾、今年仍有小灾的情况下，农业仍然连年增产，农村一直稳定繁荣，就是不可理解的了。
    在全国基本上实现农业合作化以后，时间才过去不满两年，新生的农业社都还在经历着一个逐步巩固的过程。绝大部分农业社经过多次整顿，正在走着上坡路，欣欣向荣地往前发展；一小部分由于种种原因，却落后了、停滞了，甚至涣散了。在事物的发展过程中，总是有比较先进的和比较落后的，这并不是什么怪事，而是一种正常的现象。领导者的重大责任之一，就是不断地推动和帮助落后的，赶上先进的。在这过程中，又会出现新的比较先进的和比较落后的。然后，再推动和帮助落后的前进。这样，社会就可以不断向前发展。不能用绝对固定的眼光看待落后社。落后社总是会有的，不过，各个时期它的含义会有所不同。目前的落后社不会永远都落后，问题是要看用什么方法来领导它们。
    目前的落后社是一些什么样的农业社呢？各个地方的情况也有所不同。一般地说，这些社的生产是搞得不好的，减产了，或者较多的社员减少了收入，或者虽然没有减产却完不成粮食征购任务；社里的思想教育工作做得很差，社员和社干部的积极性不高，有相当一部分人忙着搞商业投机、粮食黑市、放高利贷等资本主义活动，比较多的人缺乏集体主义的思想觉悟；社的领导权落到了资本主义思想严重的富裕中农手里，甚至落在一些地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子手里，或者社干部力量比较薄弱而又受到社内外反动势力的围攻或侵蚀；由于缺乏经验，这些社的经营管理也比较混乱，或者思想片面，没有贯彻执行互利政策。这样，社里就时常有人哄闹，有些社员想退社或者已经退社。——从这些情况可以看出来，目前的落后社之所以落后，主要是因为在这些社里资本主义思想占着优势地位，甚至封建残余势力也还没有肃清。
    怎样才能改变这些农业社的局面呢？许多事实已经回答了这个问题。最好的方法就是有领导地大鸣大放，开展大辩论。首先要鸣放得彻底，然后才能争论得细致，才能解决思想上和工作中的许多问题，使落后社摆脱落后的状态。本报9月25日刊载的广东曲江县沙园社的经验，今天发表的吉林永吉县齐心社的经验，还有其他很多地方的经验，都以生动的事实证明了这一点。
    决不应该害怕在落后社开展大辩论。落后社的底子本来就薄弱，大鸣大放之后，会不会垮台呢？落后社的邪气本来就比较大，大鸣大放之后，会不会更大呢？群众思想会不会因为大鸣大放而更加混乱？争不过人家、说不服人家怎么办？火烧到自己身上怎么办？这些顾虑是完全不必要的。
    无论何时何地，都应当对我们的社会主义事业的正义性、对大多数群众的智慧和力量有充分的坚定的信心。沙园等社的事实证明，即使是落后社的社员在大鸣大放中间发表的意见，大多数也都是正确的、有利于各种问题的解决的；对于错误的意见，大多数社员都能鉴别。在大鸣大放期间，一部分资本主义思想浓厚的人确实会趾高气扬起来，一部分思想模糊的人确实会表现动摇或者悲观失望；可是，只要大辩论展开了，正气很快就会上升，邪气很快就会退缩。社会主义的基本队伍，正是在这样的斗争中，以空前的速度成长壮大起来。
    在落后社里，资本主义思想本来就比较突出；社员对于社办得不好本来就有意见。大鸣大放只不过是让大家把在高粱地里、在茶馆里议论的话，放到座谈会、小组会、辩论会上来讲；让干部们本来听不到的话和看不到的事情能够听到和看到，让过去在各种伪装掩盖下的反对社会主义的人和他的活动显露出本来的面目。这有什么不好呢？让阴暗的角落受到阳光的照射，就不会再发霉了。霍县大泉社的坏分子不是曾经散布“社主任贪污”的谣言煽动社员闹事吗？摆到桌面上来谈，谣言立即烟消云散。如果社干部真是有毛病呢？更不应该怕。你越是遮遮掩掩，社员就越起疑心。最好是主动检讨、保证改正。让这样的“火”烧到自己身上，把身上的脏东西烧掉，又有什么不好？真金不怕火炼，越炼越纯。假金呢？本来就不能允许它以假充真。是真是假，群众终究是能看得分明的。
    当然要注意，在落后社开展大辩论，必须有坚强的领导。任何农业社的大辩论，都要有领导地进行；在落后社更要这样做。越落后的社，越要派比较强的工作组去。工作组到落后社以后，首先要解决党员和团员的思想问题，使基层干部、社干部了解全民整风的意义和步骤，解除顾虑，先在党内和团内大鸣大放大争，通过争论使党员和团员的思想基本上统一起来。在这个基础之上，进一步弄清楚党员团员的政治思想和阶级成分，以便培养积极分子，加强领导骨干，建立一支可靠的领导力量。这支领导力量，应该由党团员和贫农、下中农中的积极分子组成。同时要依靠基层党组织，对全村全社的阶级情况、思想动向作全面的了解和分析。落后社的特点之一就是缺乏强有力的社会主义的基本队伍。因此，需要特别注意在全村全社的大辩论展开之前，用相当大的力量培养积极分子，加强骨干力量。这一支起骨干作用的力量，基本上应该由党团员和贫农、下中农中的积极分子组成。
    一般地说，落后社还有一个特点：敌我矛盾和人民内部的矛盾都比较尖锐，而且是混杂在一起的；资本主义活动比较严重，社的工作缺点也比较多。在大鸣大放大争中，除了必须随时警惕地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子的破坏活动以外，要注意把社员要求改进工作的意见同根本反对社会主义制度的反动言论区别开来，把一些因为不了解情况而产生的怀疑同恶意的攻击区别开来，把一般富裕中农的错误言行同地主、富农的反革命活动区别开来，用不同的态度、不同的方法对待他们。一方面，领导整风的干部应该注意这些区别；另一方面，也要注意教育群众懂得这些区别。落后社办得不好，原因很复杂；但是归结起来，不外是资本主义势力的破坏、社员觉悟不高、社干部的工作有错误和缺点这三个方面的问题。首先，我们不应该把这三方面的问题同社会主义制度混淆起来；其次，这三方面的问题也不可互相混淆。这样，才便于分清是非、解决问题。社员中的各种错误思想要用各种适应的方式批判，社干部工作上的错误和缺点也必须坚决改正。在大辩论的过程中，能改的要边整边改；大辩论结束以后，更要集中力量比较系统地按照中共中央关于改进农业社工作的三个指示，把整社工作做好。
    应该把整顿落后社作为整社工作的重点。这不但是因为落后社特别需要大力整顿；而且也因为在整顿落后社的工作中可以取得最丰富的整社经验。落后社前进了，对一般的社也会有很大的推动作用。希望每个县委书记都能到一个或几个落后社去，直接领导整社工作；这个工作做好了，对于改变整个农村的面貌有重大的意义。
