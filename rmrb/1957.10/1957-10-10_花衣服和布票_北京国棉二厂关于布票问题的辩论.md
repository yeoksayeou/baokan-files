    Flower Clothes and Cloth Ration Coupons
    ——A Debate on Cloth Ration Coupon Issues at the Beijing No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Factory
    By Our Reporter Ye Jianyun

    Recently, the workers of the Beijing No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Factory conducted a heated debate. The topic of the debate was: Are the cloth ration coupons issued by the state sufficient?

    “Minority Submits to the Majority”

    The first batch of cloth ration coupons for 1958 was issued. At this time, a few employees in the factory successively posted several big-character posters, expressing their disagreement with the State Council's decision on cotton cloth supply.

    This matter immediately sparked widespread discussion among the workers. Some said that the cloth ration coupon issue was like an ice pop burning in a fire, getting shorter and shorter. Last year, more than 50 chi were issued, but this year only 24 chi were issued. Although the country has difficulties, we workers also have difficulties! We are asked to understand the country's difficulties, but why doesn't the country take care of the workers' lives! Others said that in the past, life was not good and we didn't have much money, so even if we had cloth ration coupons, we couldn't afford to buy cloth. Now that we have more money, the cloth ration coupons are issued so sparsely, isn't this deliberately making things difficult for us "poor people"? The most complaints came from young female workers. Especially those who loved to dress up were clamoring everywhere. They said: In the past, the leadership told us to wear flower clothes, why are we only given 16 chi of cloth ration coupons now? A flower shirt takes 7.5 chi of cloth, a pair of pants takes 7 chi, and the little bit left over isn't even enough to make a pair of shorts!

    In those days, although there were rebuttals on the big-character posters, these young women would immediately retort when they heard someone say that the cloth ration coupons were enough, saying that they were rich people, people who wear woolens. Wang Jianhua, a roving frame worker in the spinning workshop, said to everyone: "We should hold a meeting and have everyone raise their hands to vote. If the majority says that the cloth ration coupons are not enough, then the State Council will have to revise its decision, increase the quantity, and issue more coupons. This is democracy! Democracy means the minority submits to the majority."

    An Old Worker's Words

    Of course, no hand-raising vote was conducted, but it sparked a heated debate.

    At the start of the debate, Song Deshan from the spinning workshop said that everyone knew about his difficulties. He has a family of eight, and all the children, big and small, are naked. It's nothing for boys to be naked, but it's not acceptable for girls. And he is a big guy, and 16 chi of cotton cloth is not enough to make a cotton-padded coat. Song Deshan's speech aroused the sympathy of many female workers. They said that there were many people like Song Deshan whose cloth ration coupons were not enough. At this time, a worker familiar with Song Deshan stood up and said: Song Deshan's family of eight can receive more than 120 chi of cloth ration coupons. Does he really need to buy new clothes for everyone in his family this winter? Even if everyone does, the amount of cloth is enough. He says his family doesn't have enough cloth ration coupons, but on September 1st of this year, he showed me more than 50 chi of extra cloth ration coupons. He said his children are naked, but that is not true. The children's clothes are a bit worn, and there may be some short-term difficulties in life, but why don't we think of the country when it's facing difficulties, and instead emphasize our own difficulties so much?

    As soon as he finished speaking, a female worker stood up to object, saying that he didn't need to pretend to be active. Difficulties, difficulties, who doesn't know about difficulties, but you can't just ask people not to wear clothes! At this time, an old worker sitting on the side could no longer hold back. A female worker who had worked in the yarn factory for more than 30 years said: Sisters, today, everyone's lives are good. Talking about the old days and thinking about the sad things of the past seems unnecessary. As the saying goes, a tree has roots, and water has a source. People cannot forget their origins. In the past, those who worked in yarn factories, who didn't have single-layer clothes in the summer and no cotton clothes in the winter? One year, the capitalist came to the workshop and said to the workers, a big shot is coming to visit the factory tomorrow. To welcome the guest, all workers must wear white shirts and blue work pants, otherwise they will not be allowed to come to the factory. Heavens! In that era, which worker wasn't wearing tattered rags? Who could take out a decent set of clothes! Later, the factory gave everyone a set. This one set of clothes was a big deal, forcing each worker to repay the debt for four months. Now, if you go into any dormitory and casually open a trunk, whether it's single-layer, cotton-padded, or lined, who doesn't have three or five sets?

    "Are the cloth ration coupons enough or not? Not abundant, but enough." This was the opinion of another old worker. He said, I have been working for more than 20 years. In the past, when workers went to the workshop, they had to change into old clothes. At that time, everyone wore old patched clothes to the factory, and no one laughed at anyone. But now, young people, inside and out, pay attention to dressing up when they go to town to see friends, and they don't want to wear old clothes in the workshop. Hard work and frugality, and diligence and thrift in managing a household, these are the good habits of our ancestors. Now, the young people of our generation have forgotten all of this! …

    On this issue, there have been countless disputes between new and old workers. The new workers said that the old workers were conservative and wanted to hoard family assets. The old workers said that the new workers didn't know the bitterness and sweetness of life, changed their flower clothes every other day, and were really too immodest.

    How Many Flower Clothes Do They Have?

    Today, the words of the old workers have aroused the memories of most people.

    Some of the female workers who had previously joined others in complaining that the cloth ration coupons were not enough began to wake up after the old workers raised the issue of hard work and frugality. Some people, in order to clarify their own situation, voluntarily made an inventory and reorganization of the clothes in their boxes and chests. No one had ever calculated how many clothes they had, how many clothes had been added to each person's box and bedside, or how many chi of cloth had been bought. Now, they were unconsciously beginning to calculate this account. The following is the result of accounting in an ordinary female worker's dormitory.

    Room 34 on the fourth floor of Building B is inhabited by six female workers: Li Rujin, Xu Fengqin, Feng Yu'e, Zhao Shuling, Chu Yonglian, and Guo Suqin. The longest they have been in the factory is more than two years, and the shortest is one year. Within one or two years, these six female workers have added a total of:

    1. Eleven cotton-padded jackets, each with 15 chi of cloth, totaling 165 chi;
    2. Twenty Lenin-style tunics, each with 8 chi of cloth, totaling 160 chi;
    3. Forty-one various flower shirts, each with 7.5 chi, totaling 307.5 chi;
    4. Forty pairs of cloth pants, each with 7 chi of cloth, totaling 280 chi;
    5. Four lined jackets, each with 14 chi of cloth, totaling 56 chi;
    6. Three skirts and dresses, each with 6 chi of cloth, totaling 18 chi;
    7. Thirty-four quilts, mattresses, and bed sheets, averaging 20 chi of cloth per bed, totaling 680 chi;
    8. Eight cotton vests, cotton pants, and corduroy clothes, averaging 8 chi of cloth per item, totaling 64 chi.

    In addition, there were eighteen woolen clothes and knitted items, fifteen pairs of leather shoes, and fifteen pairs of sneakers.

    The total cloth used for the above clothing and bedding is 1730.5 chi. Adding 15 chi of cloth that has not been made into clothes, the total is 1745.5 chi. On average, each person has used more than 288 chi of cloth in one or two years. Of course, some of these clothes were made not long ago, some have only been used for a little over a year, and some have only been worn once or twice. Not only are they not broken, but they are also rarely old. Some seem a little too big or a little too small, but with slight modifications, they can be worn again.

    After a thorough examination, everyone realized that it was not that the cloth ration coupons were not enough or that there were not enough clothes, but that they wanted to wear a few more sets of flower clothes. Some female workers said: In the past, I would go to the department store as soon as I got off work. Whenever new varieties of colorful cloth came in, I wanted to buy a few chi. In fact, there were plenty of flower clothes, as many as seven or eight, and at least three or four. Saying that 16 chi of cloth ration coupons were not enough was all nonsense.

    The debate on the cloth ration coupon issue among the workers of the No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Factory has ended. Through this debate, a spirit of thrift has begun to be established. Those who originally clamored that the cloth ration coupons were not enough stopped clamoring, those who originally requested the State Council to issue supplementary cloth ration coupons withdrew their suggestions, those who originally planned to buy a few more sets of flower cloth have now decided not to buy them, and some workshops that originally requested the public to issue new work clothes have now proposed making full use of old ones, and not receiving the 1958 work clothes. According to statistics, if this initiative is realized, the entire factory can save more than 40,000 chi of cotton cloth for the country.

    花衣服和布票
    ——北京国棉二厂关于布票问题的辩论
    本报记者　叶剑韵
    在最近的一段时间里，北京国棉二厂的工人们进行了一场热烈的辩论。辩论的题目是：国家规定的布票够不够用。
    “少数服从多数”
    1958年的第一期布票发下来了。就在这个时候，厂里的个别职工接连贴了几张大字报，表示不同意国务院关于棉布供应的决定。
    这件事，立即在工人中间普遍议论开了。有的说，布票问题像冰棒烧火越烧越短，去年发五十多尺，今年只发二十四尺，虽说国家有困难，咱们工人也有困难呀！要咱们体谅国家的困难，为什么国家就不照顾工人的生活哩！也有人说，过去日子过的不好，手头不宽，有布票又没有钱买；现在手头宽裕一些了，布票又是发的那么少，这不是存心和咱“穷人”为难。意见最多的是青年女工。特别是那些爱打扮的女工，更是到处嚷嚷。她们说：过去领导上叫咱穿花衣服，现在为什么只发十六尺布票？一件花衬衫七尺五寸布，一条裤子七尺，多下来的一点布，还不够做件短裤衩哩！
    那几天，大字报上虽然也有反驳的意见，但是，这些姑娘们听到谁说布票够用了，就马上顶撞说，这是有钱户，是穿料子户。细纱车间的推纱工王建华对大伙说：“咱们应当开个会，要大家来举手表决，如果是多数人说布票不够用，那么，国务院就得修改决定，增加数量，补发布票。这是民主嘛！民主，就得少数服从多数。
    老工人的一席话
    当然举手表决并没有进行，结果却引起了一场热烈的辩论。
    辩论会开始，细纱车间的宋德山就说，我的困难是大家都知道的，一家八口，大小孩子都光着屁股，男孩子光屁股没什么，女的可不像话。我的个子又大，一身棉衣十六尺扯不下来。宋德山的发言，引起了不少女工的同情。她们说，像宋德山这样布票不够用的人多得很。这时有个熟悉宋德山的工人就站起来说：宋德山一家八口，可以领到一百二十多尺布票，难道今年冬季他家每个人都需要添衣服不成，即使每个人都添，大小牵扯，也尽够的了。他说他家布票不够，今年9月1日，他还拿出了五十来尺多余的布票给我看过呢。他说他家的孩子光着腚，这也不是事实；孩子们是穿得破一点，生活上短时期内虽有一些困难，为什么在国家发生困难的时候，我们不替国家想想，反而把自己的困难提得这么高呢？
    他的话刚落音，有个女工就站起来反对，说他不用假积极了。困难，困难，谁还不知道困难，总不能叫人不穿衣服呀！这时，在一旁坐着的老工人，再也憋不住气了，一个在纱厂里做了三十多年工的女工说：姐妹们，今天，大家的日子都过好了，再去谈过去的老话，想过去的伤心事，好像是犯不着。常言说得好，树有根，水有源，人不能忘本。在过去，做纱厂的，那个不是夏天没单的，冬天没棉的。有一年，资本家到车间来对工人们说，明天有个大人物来厂参观，为了欢迎客人，全体工人上身要穿白衬衫，下身穿青工装裤，否则就不准来厂。天哪！那个时期的工人，有谁不是披破挂片的，谁能拿出一套体面衣服来！后来厂里给每人发了一套。这一套衣服不打紧，却逼着每个工人还了四个月的债。现在走到哪个宿舍里，随便打开一只箱子瞧瞧，单的棉的夹的，有谁没有三套五套的。
    “布票究竟够不够用呢？不宽裕，可是够用。”这是另一个老工人的意见。他说，我做工也有二十多年了。在过去，工人们下车间，都要换上一身旧的。那时候，进厂穿旧的补钉衣服，大家如此，谁也不笑话谁。可是，现在的年青人，没里没外，进城看朋友讲究穿戴，在车间里也不肯穿旧的。艰苦朴素，勤俭持家，这是我们祖祖辈辈的好习惯，现在，到了我们这一代的青年人，可把这些全忘啦！……
    在这个问题上，新老工人之间不知发生过多少争执。新工人说老工人保守，想扒家挣业。老工人说新工人不知苦乐早红暮绿，三天两头换件花衣服，真是太不朴素了。
    她们有多少花衣服
    今天，老工人的一席话，却引起了多数人的回忆。
    部分曾经随着别人叫嚷布票不够的女工，在老工人们提出了艰苦朴素的问题以后，开始清醒了。有些人为了弄清自己的家底，自动的把箱笼的衣服做了一番检点和整理，究竟有些什么衣服，每个人箱子里，床头上添了多少衣服，买了多少尺布，从来是没有人算过账的。现在，不自觉的开始算起这笔账来了。下面是一个普通女工宿舍算账的结果。
    乙型楼四楼三十四号房间，住着李如锦、徐凤琴、冯玉娥、赵淑玲、褚永莲、郭素琴六个女工。她们进厂的年月最长的两年多，最短的一年；在一两年之内，这六个女工合计添置了：
    1、棉袄十一件，每件里面十五尺布，计一六五尺；
    2、列宁装上衣二十件，每件八尺布，计一六○尺；
    3、各色花衬衫四十一件，每件七点五尺，计三○七点五尺；
    4、布裤子四十条，每条七尺布，计二八○尺；
    5、夹袄四件，里面十四尺布，计五十六尺；
    6、裙子、连衣裙三件，每件六尺布，计十八尺；
    7、被、褥、床单三十四床，平均每床二十尺布，计六八○尺；
    8、棉猴、棉裤、灯心绒衣裤八件，每件平均八尺布，计六十四尺。
    其他毛料衣裤和针织品十八件，皮鞋十五双，球鞋十五双。
    以上布料衣裤、被单合计是一七三○点五尺布。再加上十五尺未做衣服的布料子，合计是一七四五点五尺。平均每人在一两年当中，就使用了二八八尺多布。当然这些衣物有的是刚做不久，有的才使用了一年多一点，有的只穿过一两次，不仅没有破，也很少是旧的，有的似乎肥一点或者瘦一点，只要略加修改，完全可以继续穿下去。
    经过一番检查，大伙全认识到，不是布票不够用衣服不够穿，而是想多穿几身花衣服。有的女工说：过去，一下班就去逛百货公司，凡是来了新品种的花色布，都想扯几尺。其实花衣服有的是，多的七、八件，少的也有三、四件。说十六尺布票不够，全是瞎闹哄。
    国棉二厂职工们关于布票问题的辩论已经结束了。通过这次辩论，开始树立了节约的风气，原来叫嚷布票不够的不叫了，原来要求国务院补发布票的也撤回了他们的建议了，原来打算多买几身花布的现在已决定不买了，原来要求公家发给新工作服的，现在有些车间提出充分利用旧的，不领1958年的工作服的倡议。据统计，如果这一项倡议实现了的话，全厂可以为国家节省四万多尺棉布。
