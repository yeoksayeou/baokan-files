Mobilizing All Forces to Support Agricultural Production
(Continued from yesterday)

The Relationship Between Finance, Trade, and Agriculture

The price of agricultural products is the most critical issue in the relationship between agriculture and commerce. Appropriate pricing can promote the development of production, while inappropriate pricing can lead to its destruction. There are many examples of this. Zhejiang is a tea oil producing area, with 1.2 million mu of oil tea forests. Before the war, the highest annual output of tea seeds (1937) reached 617,000 dan. During the war, large areas of oil tea forests were abandoned. After liberation, the price of tea seeds was low, and some purchasing personnel suppressed grades and prices, causing farmers to lose money. As a result, recovery was slow. In 1955, the Provincial Party Committee inspected the problems in the management of oil tea, and adopted active development measures. Within two years, most of the abandoned oil tea forests had been reclaimed, and about 2.4 million mu of new oil tea forests had been planted. Another example is sun-cured tobacco. Prices were continuously increased in 1950 and 1951, and the output reached 240,000 dan in 1952. In the second half of 1952, the price per dan dropped from 32.6 yuan to 24 yuan, and the output sharply decreased. In the past two years, the price has been stable at around 29 yuan per dan, which is still low, and the output has remained at around 150,000 dan, failing to recover to the 1952 level. In the past, the prices of major agricultural products were set by the central commercial system. Although a certain range was left for local adjustments, it still could not adapt to the production conditions of various regions. The situation may change after the right to adjust prices is delegated to the local level.

Grain prices are also worth studying. Farmers know the importance of increasing grain production. After the Party's education, most cooperatives can implement the state-prescribed grain planting area plan. However, due to the generally low grain prices, most people are not very enthusiastic about producing commodity grain. Even if they implement the state's plan in terms of planting area, they will prioritize the use of manpower and materials for crops with high output value in processing and fertilization. This will inevitably be detrimental to increasing grain production. However, since grain prices affect a wide range of areas, raising grain prices is currently unfavorable. At present, we can only maintain the status quo of grain prices through ideological and economic work, but this is not a long-term solution. After agricultural cooperation, the law of value still plays a significant role in agricultural production. To increase the amount of commodity grain, further research should be conducted on the grain price policy. In addition, there are many problems in terms of prices. Relevant units are busy with administrative work and have not studied and solved them well. Therefore, it is necessary for local authorities to establish specialized price research institutions to serve as assistants to the Party and the government in mastering price policies.

The issue of the form of cooperation between certain commercial units and units guiding agricultural production. The production of cash crops in agriculture is almost entirely commodity production and is closely related to commercial departments. Especially for export goods such as silk and tea, competition in the international market is fierce, and the quality requirements for products are very strict, requiring better cooperation. Before liberation, tobacco companies selected tobacco varieties and planting areas based on the needs of cigarette production. The collaboration among silk, silkworm, and mulberry trees is very close. Our current silk is managed separately by the Special Products Bureau of the Department of Agriculture, the Silkworm Cocoon Acquisition Office of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Silk Company, and the Silk Industry Professional Company of the Department of Industry. The agricultural department guides mulberry and cocoon production, the commercial department manages acquisition, transportation, and sales, and the industrial department manufactures silk. The forces are not unified, and several issues are based on their own positions, increasing many contradictions. In order to solve this problem, we plan to combine the industrial and commercial silk management organizations into a structure similar to a trust, to achieve unity in tasks and organization, and then gradually study and solve the problem of cooperation with silkworm and mulberry guidance institutions.

The issue of commercial investment in agriculture, that is, drawing a portion of commercial profits to support agricultural production, and then increasing profit income from the development of agricultural production. For example, wood and bamboo are the most lacking materials in national construction, but a considerable amount of these materials in Zhejiang rot in the deep mountains. According to rough calculations, Zhejiang's wood reserves are about 100 million cubic meters. Among them, mature forests and near-mature forests are about 380 million cubic meters. Based on 25 years of forest formation, without counting new afforestation, existing forests can be harvested at 1.5 million cubic meters per year, but only 950,000 cubic meters were harvested in 1956. There are about 4.65 million mu of bamboo forests, which can produce 37 million dan of bamboo per year. In 1956, the people used about 11 million dan of bamboo for their own use, and the state purchased only 9 million dan. This is mainly a transportation problem. In 1956, the state and mountain farmers invested 620,000 yuan to open up 171 kilometers of forest roads and 504 kilometers of waterways, solving the road problem in mountainous areas occupying 560,000 cubic meters of wood. The benefits of this investment are preliminarily calculated: mountain farmers can get about 8 yuan of pure mountain price (referring to pure wood income) per cubic meter of wood, and the state can get 6 yuan in taxes and 19 yuan in profits. The benefits obtained by mountain farmers and the state are about 33 yuan per cubic meter. That is to say, the 620,000 yuan invested in opening up forest roads and waterways in 1956 not only allowed 560,000 cubic meters of wood to be gradually transported out to solve the extremely scarce construction materials problem, but also allowed the state and mountain farmers to obtain benefits of several million yuan from here. The reason why the transportation problem has not been solved for a long time is that the local transportation fee is very small and cannot solve the problem of mountain roads; although the forestry profit is very large, it must all be turned over to the state, and the local authorities cannot use it. The situation of goods being abandoned on the ground on the one hand and tight supply on the other is not an isolated case. There are similar examples in fishery production.

The Relationship Between Culture, Education, and Agriculture

To gradually make our agriculture an agriculture armed with modern science after cooperation, in addition to the issue of agricultural mechanization, we must also solve the issues of cultural education and agricultural scientific research and popularization of science.

The current situation is: on the one hand, most farmers are still illiterate, and most rural work cadres, although they have experience in political struggle and mass movements, lack agricultural scientific knowledge. Therefore, cadres and the masses have great limitations in accepting other people's production experience and summarizing their own production experience. On the other hand, school graduates are unwilling to go to the countryside, or they have no effect when they go. The prevailing view in society is: "Graduation or not, we are all farming, why bother to study!" It seems that agriculture does not need culture at all.

The further development of agriculture requires farmers to have certain scientific knowledge, and students must return to the actual production to apply the knowledge after obtaining knowledge from books. The two must be combined. The problem now is that we have not done this work well, so there is a disconnection between education and agricultural production. We lack agricultural scientists, but the issue of the career path of agricultural college graduates has not been well resolved. State agricultural administrative organs, agricultural research organs, and state-owned farms need these people, but most of the positions are full, and large-scale adjustments cannot be made for a while; agricultural cooperatives need them very much, but the remuneration is low, and college students are unwilling to go. How to give full play to the role of a large number of middle and primary school graduates after returning to the countryside is also an unresolved issue.

According to the needs of agricultural development, the provincial agricultural science research institute should be able to conduct systematic research on the major crops in the province; the county's demonstration farm should be equipped with researchers to conduct research on the major crops in the county; the quality of the district's technology promotion station should be improved, so that the technicians who have graduated from secondary agricultural technical schools can gradually improve to the level of agricultural college graduates through rotation training, and be able to guide the technicians of agricultural cooperatives and summarize the technical experience of the cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives should make full use of the existing strength of middle and primary school graduates, and gradually ensure that the agricultural production, sideline production, and various production teams of the cooperatives have personnel who have received specialized training to serve as technicians, so that middle school graduates with general cultural knowledge have a clear direction of effort in agricultural labor. These cultural and technical workers should not be separated from production, but should all participate in agricultural and sideline production, and be paid according to their work in production. Only for the working hours serving the cooperative will the cooperative give appropriate remuneration, just like the current accounting, work recorder, and custodian calculate labor remuneration. The expenses required for them to perform state duties or further studies can be borne by the cooperative or given necessary subsidies by the state, depending on the circumstances. The national business administrative departments, such as agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, aquaculture, education, and health departments, conduct work among the masses through these personnel, and provide necessary guidance and assistance to these people.

The national education plan needs to be appropriately adjusted according to the situation in rural areas. The main task of the provincial agricultural college should be to train researchers for the province and county and technicians for the district technology promotion station according to local needs. Secondary agricultural technical schools should mainly focus on rotating training of cooperative technicians. Students should be recommended by the cooperative and no longer recruited from the society. The school system and curriculum should be appropriately adjusted according to the actual situation. Rural middle and primary schools should teach basic knowledge of agricultural production and cooperation while maintaining the necessary basic education principles.

After these basic cultural forces are available in rural areas, when colleges and universities enroll students, they should stipulate a certain proportion of the quota to be selected by these grass-roots units, and gradually reduce the proportion of high school graduates who continue to go to school without participating in production practice. In this way, on the one hand, the professional talents trained by the school are outstanding individuals who have been tested by production practice, and the goals of education and learning are consistent; on the other hand, it can also change the traditional influence of "graduation is going to school" and students' contempt for labor. To this end, necessary systems should be stipulated to conduct regular examinations for students who study on their own in their spare time, and diplomas should be issued to those who pass the examination, thereby opening up the road to university for young people in employment.

From the perspective of the education popularization issue in Zhejiang, rural primary schools should gradually implement the policy of "cooperative-run as the main, public assistance as the supplement." According to our preliminary calculations, if 95% of school-age children are enrolled in 1967, the number of students will increase by 250,000 each year. Based on a ratio of 1:30 teachers to students, 8,333 teachers will be added, and the annual funding will increase by 3.5 million yuan. By 1967, the current elementary school funding will reach 71.33 million yuan, and a total of 231 million yuan in national budget expenditures will be added over these eleven years. This number is very large, and if it is entirely borne by the state, it will affect other construction undertakings. If a cooperative-run approach is adopted, this contradiction can be solved by the cooperative without the need for the state to solve it centrally. If the production of the local cooperative develops quickly, the development of education can also be faster, and if the production develops slowly, the development of education will also be slower. The speed is determined by the cooperative itself. Many problems are easier to solve when they are dispersed and rely on the power of the masses, but when they are concentrated, they become big problems and it is difficult to find a unified and effective solution. For many issues in people's lives, history and the present are better solved in a decentralized manner. Too much concentration by the state can easily disperse the state's ability to solve problems that must be solved, cultivate the people's reliance on views, increase the difficulty of solving problems, and increase the contradictions between the people and the state.

Achieve the Agricultural Development Program (Draft) with the Determination to Achieve Industrialization

After the promulgation of the Agricultural Development Program (Draft), the propaganda work has not been done well enough. The propaganda on the importance of industrialization has been continuously carried out since the general line was put forward, which is entirely necessary. It has formed a huge driving force, attracting the broad masses to devote themselves to this great cause. People in various jobs are also honored to be able to support industrial construction. The living conditions of agricultural laborers are not more difficult than those of railway construction workers or geological exploration personnel, but many young students and demobilized soldiers are unwilling to participate in agricultural production, and some rural youths are not satisfied with agricultural production. People in industrial, commercial, and cultural jobs do not have many proposals to support agriculture. This shows that our propaganda on the importance of agriculture is still not enough. From the perspective of Zhejiang, if the speed of agricultural development cannot be rapidly increased in the next ten years, the tense situation of industrial construction and people's lives will still not be eased. The population of Zhejiang was 20.66 million in 1936 (this number comes from "Zhejiang Economic Statistics" before the Anti-Japanese War), and it has increased to 24.11 million by 1956, an increase of 16.7%. At the same time, grain production only increased by 10.7%, that is, 1.48 billion jin. As a result, the average per capita raw grain decreased from 668 jin to 634 jin, a decrease of 34 jin. After liberation, from 1953 to 1956, grain increased by an average of 2.25% per year, while the population increased by 2.45% per year. The rate of population increase also exceeded the rate of grain increase. This situation is abnormal, and we must strive to change this situation. In addition to vigorously promoting family planning, we should accelerate the rate of agricultural growth. To this end, we must insist on publicizing the importance of developing agricultural production, educating all the people to achieve the Agricultural Development Program (Draft) with the determination to strive for industrialization. At present, the socialist revolution has basically been completed, and in the future, we can concentrate our efforts on technical revolution and cultural revolution. The road to increasing production is very broad. We should see these possibilities in order to mobilize farmers to work hard in agricultural production, mobilize young students and demobilized soldiers to participate in agricultural production, and mobilize staff in all positions to support agricultural production, so that all people deeply believe that through hard work, the Agricultural Development Program (Draft) can be realized, and my country's agriculture can gradually develop into modern agriculture, and the cultural and material lives of farmers will also be improved with the development of agricultural production.

In the first four years of the first five-year plan, the focus of the Provincial Party Committee's leadership was on socialist transformation, and it failed to systematically study and solve these collaboration problems ideologically and organizationally. After preliminary research, it is felt that this problem is very complicated. Economic life is an organic whole, and various production activities are interconnected. The development of production requires detailed division of labor and specialization, and many professional institutions are constantly being established. On the one hand, the development of specialization has brought benefits to improving business, but on the other hand, it has inevitably developed mutual ignorance of the situation and departmentalism. Our lack of experience in leading construction and the existence of bureaucratic work style have made us unable to discover and solve the collaboration problems that arise with specialization in a timely manner, and the current system of the country has also created some difficulties for local authorities in solving these problems. These problems will be fundamentally changed after the rectification movement. The rectification will fundamentally overcome ideological obstacles in collaboration. The whole Party will further solve the problem of collaboration based on scientific division of labor when studying and solving internal contradictions of the people. Emphasizing the issue of collaboration in socialist construction can also overcome some contradictions arising from departmentalism. "Simple collaboration can also produce great results." (See Marx's "Capital") Now, under the socialist system, we have a collaboration scale covering the whole country. If we can concentrate the scientific achievements of industry, agriculture, commerce, culture, education, etc. and apply them to the realization of the agricultural development program, the agricultural development speed can not only achieve a growth rate of 2.25%-5%, but also expect a higher growth rate.

　　动员各种力量支援农业生产
　　（续昨）
    财政贸易与农业的关系
    农产品价格问题是农、商关系中最尖锐的问题。规定得恰当就能够推动生产的发展，规定得不恰当就会引起生产的破坏。在这方面的例子是很多的。浙江是茶油产区之一，有油茶林一百二十万亩，战前茶籽最高年产量（1937年）曾经达到六十一万七千担，战争时期油茶林大量荒芜，加以解放以后茶籽价格偏低，某些收购人员又压级压价，农民培育亏本，因而恢复不快。1955年省委检查了经营油茶方面存在的问题，采取积极发展的措施，两年之内荒芜的油茶林已经大部垦复，新造油茶林约有二百四十万亩。又如晒烟，1950年和1951年连续提高价格，1952年产量达到二十四万担，1952年下半年每担价格由三十二元六角下降到二十四元，产量锐减，最近两年价格稳定在每担二十九元左右，仍然偏低，产量维持在十五万担左右，不能恢复到1952年的水平。主要农产品的价格过去是中央商业系统规定的，虽然留有一定幅度给地方机动调整，但是仍然不能适应各种不同地区的生产情况；调整权下放后情况可能改变。
    粮价也很值得研究，增产粮食的重要性，农民是知道的，多数合作社经过党的教育，还能执行国家规定的粮食种植面积计划，但是由于粮价一般偏低，更多的人对生产商品粮食的积极性是不高的，他们即使在种植面积上执行了国家的计划，在加工、施肥方面，却将人力、物力首先放在产值高的作物上面，这样就必然会对提高粮食产量不利。但是由于粮价牵动的面很大，提高粮价在当前是不利的；目前只能通过思想工作和经济工作使粮价维持现状，但这不是长久之计。农业合作化以后，价值规律在农业生产中仍然有很大的作用，要增加大量的商品粮食，对粮食价格政策应当作进一步的研究。此外，在价格方面的问题还很多，有关单位忙于行政业务没有很好地加以研究解决，因此地方有必要建立专门研究物价的机构，作为党和政府掌握价格政策的助手。
    若干商业单位和指导农业生产单位的协作组织形式问题。农业中经济作物的生产，几乎全部是商品性的生产，和商业部门关系很密切。特别是丝、茶等出口物资，国际市场上竞争激烈，产品的质量要求很严，需要有更好的协作关系。解放前的烟草公司根据制烟需要，来选择烟草品种、种植地区。丝、蚕、桑三个环节的协作是很密切的。我们现在的蚕丝分别由农业厅的特产局、供销社的蚕茧收购办事处、丝绸公司、工业厅的丝绸工业专业公司四个单位分别经营。农业部门指导桑、茧生产，商业部门管收购、运销，工业部门制丝，力量不统一，若干问题又各从本位出发，增加很多矛盾。为了解决这个问题，我们准备把工业和商业的丝绸管理组织合成一个类似托拉斯那样的组织，从任务和组织上求得统一，再逐步研究解决同蚕桑指导机构的协作问题。
    商业对农业的投资问题，即从商业利润中抽出一部分扶持农业生产，再从发展农业生产中增加利润收入的问题。如木材、竹材是国家建设中最缺乏的物资，而浙江这种物资有相当数量在深山里腐烂。根据粗略的计算，浙江的木材蓄积量约有一亿立方公尺。其中成熟林和近成熟林约有三亿八千万立方公尺，以二十五年成林计算，不算新造林，只就现有林每年可以采伐一百五十万立方公尺，但是1956年只采伐了九十五万立方公尺。竹林约有四百六十五万亩，每年可以产竹材三千七百万担。1956年群众自用竹材约为一千一百万担，国家采购量只有九百万担。这主要是交通问题。1956年国家和山农投资六十二万元，开辟林道一百七十一公里，河道五百零四公里，解决了占有木材五十六万立方公尺的山区道路问题。这笔投资的利益初步计算：每立方公尺木材山农可得纯山价（指木材纯收入）八元左右，国家可得税收六元、利润十九元。山农和国家所得利益每立方公尺大约为三十三元，就是说1956年投资六十二万元开辟了林道河道，不但有五十六万立方公尺的木材可以逐步运出解决极端缺乏的建设物资问题，而且从这里国家和山农可以获得一千几百万元的好处。交通问题之所以长期未能解决，是由于地方交通费为数很少，不能解决山区道路问题；林业利润虽然很大，但是要全部上交，地方不能动用。像这样一方面货弃于地，一方面供应紧张的情况，还不是个别的，在渔业生产中也有相同的例子。
    文化教育和农业的关系
    要使我国农业在合作化以后逐步成为用现代科学武装起来的农业，除了农业机械化的问题之外，还要解决文化教育和农业的科学研究、科学普及问题。
    现在的状况是：一方面大多数农民还是文盲，大多数农村工作干部，虽然具有政治斗争和群众运动的经验，但是缺乏农业科学知识。因此干部和群众接受别人的生产经验和总结自己的生产经验都有很大的局限性。另一方面是学校毕业生不愿意到农村去，或者去了没有发生作用，社会上流行的看法是：“毕业不毕业都是种地，何必读书呢！”似乎农业根本不需要文化。
    农业的进一步发展要求农民有一定的科学知识，学生在得到书本知识之后一定要回到生产实际中去应用。两者是必须结合的。现在的问题是我们没有很好地进行这一工作，因此就存在着教育和农业生产脱节的现象。我们缺乏农业科学工作者，但是农学院毕业生的出路问题还未很好地得到解决。国家农业行政机关、农业研究机关、国营农场需要这些人，但是大部分编制满额了，一时也不能作大量的调整；农业合作社很需要他们，但是报酬低，大学生不愿去。大量的中、小学毕业生回到农村以后，如何发挥这些人的作用，问题也未解决。
    按照农业发展的需要，省的农业科学研究所应该对省内的主要农作物都能够进行系统的研究工作；县的示范农场应该配备研究员，对县内的主要农作物进行研究；区的技术推广站应该提高质量，使技术员由现在中等农业技术学校毕业的水平经过轮训逐步提高到农学院毕业的水平，能够担负起对农业合作社技术员进行辅导和总结合作社技术经验的责任。农业合作社应当充分利用现有的中小学毕业生的力量，逐步做到社的农业生产、副业生产以及各个生产队都有受过专门训练的人员担任技术员，使有了一般文化知识的中学毕业生在农业劳动中有明确的努力方向。这些文化、技术工作者不应该脱离生产，而应该全部参加农、副业生产，在生产中按劳取酬。只是为合作社服务的劳动时间，合作社才给以适当的报酬，如同现在对会计、记工员、保管员那样计算劳动报酬。他们执行国家业务或者进修所需的费用，则可以按照情况，由社负担或者由国家给予必要的补助。国家的业务行政部门，如农业、林业、水利、水产、教育、卫生等部门，通过这些人员在群众中进行工作，对这些人进行必要的辅导和帮助。
    国家的教育计划，有必要按照农村情况作适当的调整。省的农学院的主要任务应当是按照地方需要训练省、县的研究员以及区技术推广站的技术员。中等农业技术学校应当以轮训合作社的技术员为主要任务，学生由合作社保送，不再在社会上招生。学制、课程都应当按照实际情况作适当的调整。农村中、小学在保持必要的基础教育的原则下，应当讲授农业生产和合作化的基本知识。
    在农村有了这些文化基本力量之后，大专学校在招生的时候，应当规定一定比例的名额，由这些基层单位选送，逐步缩小那些不参加生产实践就继续升学的高中毕业生的比例。这样做，一方面可以使学校培养的专业人才是经过生产实践考验的优秀分子，教育和学习目标一致；另一方面也可以改变“毕业就升学”和学生轻视劳动的传统影响。为此，应当规定必要的制度，对业余自学的学生实行定期考试，成绩及格的发给文凭，从而打开在业青年通向大学的道路。
    教育普及问题，从浙江情况来看，农村小学应当逐步实行“社办为主、公助为辅”的方针。我们初步计算，如果在1967年做到95％的学龄儿童入学，每年要递增学生二十五万人，教师以一比三十计算，要增加八千三百三十三人，经费每年要递增三百五十万元，到1967年当年小学经费要达到七千一百三十三万元，这十一年中共需增加国家预算支出二亿三千一百万元。这个数字是很大的，完全由国家负担，会影响其他建设事业。如果采取社办为主的方针，这个矛盾就可以由合作社去解决，不需要集中由国家来解决。当地合作社的生产发展快，就可以使教育的发展也快，生产发展慢，教育的发展也要慢，快慢都由合作社自己决定。许多问题分散了依靠群众力量比较容易解决，集中起来成了大问题就很难找到统一的有效的解决办法。人民生活的许多问题，历史与现状都是以分散解决为好，国家集中的太多，容易分散国家解决必需解决的问题的能力，养成人民群众的依赖观点，增大解决问题的困难，增大人民群众和国家的矛盾。
    要以争取实现工业化的决心来实现农业发展纲要（草案）
    农业发展纲要（草案）公布以后，宣传工作做得很不够。工业化重要性的宣传，从提出总路线以来一直在坚持进行，这完全是必要的，它已经形成巨大的动力，吸引着广大群众为这一伟大事业而献身奋斗，各个工作岗位上的人们，也都以能够支援工业建设为荣。农业劳动者的生活条件并不比铁路建筑工人、地质勘探人员的生活条件更苦，但是不少青年学生、转业军人不愿意参加农业生产，若干农村青年也不安于农业生产，在工业、商业、文化工作岗位上的人们对支援农业的倡议也不多。这就说明我们对于农业重要性的宣传还是不够的。从浙江情况来看，农业发展的速度在今后的十年中如果不能迅速地增长，则工业建设和人民生活的紧张情况仍然是不会和缓的。浙江的人口，1936年是二千零六十六万
  （这个数字来自抗战前“浙江经济统计”），到1956年已经增加到二千四百十一万，增加了16.7％，与此同时，粮食生产只增长10.7％，即十四亿八千万斤。这样一来，每人平均原粮由六百六十八斤减到六百三十四斤，即减少了三十四斤。解放以后，从1953年到1956年，粮食每年平均增长2.25％，而人口每年增加2.45％，人口增加的速度也超过了粮食增长的速度。这种情况是不正常的，我们必须努力改变这种情况，除大力提倡计划生育以外，应当加快农业增长的速度。为此，必须坚持宣传发展农业生产的重要性，教育全体人民以争取实现工业化的决心来实现农业发展纲要（草案）。目前社会主义革命已经基本完成，今后可以集中力量进行技术革命和文化革命，增产的道路是很广阔的，我们应当看到这些可能性，以便动员农民安心搞好农业生产，动员青年学生、转业军人参加农业生产，动员一切岗位上的工作人员支援农业生产，使全体人民深信经过艰苦奋斗，可以实现农业发展纲要（草案），我国农业可以逐步地发展成为现代化的农业，农民的文化、物质生活也将随着农业生产的发展而获得改善。
    在第一个五年计划的前四年中省委的领导重点是放在社会主义改造方面，没有能够从思想上组织上系统地研究和解决这些协作问题。经过初步研究以后，感到这个问题是很复杂的。经济生活是有机的整体，各种生产活动是互相联系的。生产的发展要求分工细、专业化，许多专业机构就不断地建立起来。专业化的发展，一方面给提高业务带来了好处，另一方面又不可避免地发展了互不了解情况和本位主义。我们缺乏领导建设的经验和存在着官僚主义作风，又使我们不能及时地发现和解决随着专业化同时提出的协作问题，国家的现行体制，使地方在解决这些问题上也有若干困难。这些问题在整风运动以后将会有根本改变，整风将从根本上克服协作中的思想障碍，全党在研究解决人民内部矛盾时，将进一步地解决在科学分工基础上的协作问题；而重视社会主义建设中的协作问题也可以克服若干从本位主义出发的矛盾。“简单的协作，也可以生出伟大的结果来。”（见马克思“资本论”），我们现在在社会主义制度下拥有国家范围的协作规模，如果能够使工业、农业、商业、文化教育等等方面的科学成果，集中应用到实现农业发展纲要上来，农业的发展速度不仅可以实现由2.25％—5％的增长，而且可以期望出现更高的增长比例。
                                            （完）
