Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th: Three hundred and thirteen industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises in Henan Province have begun rectification, and a number of pioneering units have already entered the stage of comprehensive improvement.

Currently, hundreds of thousands of workers in eight cities including Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Jiaozuo, and Hebi, as well as in several special districts, are engaging in extensive airing of views and debates (大鸣大放 - Da Ming Da Fang).

In order to thoroughly improve work, the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently decided that everyone should raise their opinions fully and thoroughly, without omitting a single one. According to incomplete statistics, employees in various units have raised more than 200,000 opinions.

While airing views and debates, all units have established specialized organizations to improve work. After carefully analyzing the opinions raised by workers, Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Factory No. 3 determined that more than 10,000 items should be included in the first batch of issues to be resolved. The factory set up an "Improvement Measures Column" and regularly announced the problems that had been solved, one by one. Chen Meihua, a worker, resubmitted a rationalization proposal that had been shelved for more than two years to "reduce the wear of the shuttle box back panel." Technicians believed that the proposal was valuable, and the leadership immediately supported testing it on twenty looms. It is understood that the seventy-nine units in Zhengzhou that have now entered the rectification phase can resolve tens of thousands of issues of various sizes before National Day.

The slogan put forward by the employees in the airing of views and debates is "Rectification and Production Must Not Be Delayed." In early September, while engaging in extensive airing of views and debates and improving work, the Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Factory No. 3 saw eight work zones achieve a 100% attendance rate, and seven work zones produced no substandard cloth. The Zhengzhou Railway Sub-bureau transported 50,000 tons more of freight during the thirteen days of the climax of airing views and debates.

Employees sincerely helping the Party with rectification has strengthened the determination of cadres to improve their work. Party secretaries and factory directors in many units copy down the opinions of employees from big-character posters and "Airing Views and Debates Gardens" every day, so that they can be sorted, summarized, and resolved in a timely manner. Section and office cadres have also generally gone deep into the workshops. Li Yucheng, the director of the repair workshop of the Oil and Fat Chemical Factory, who had always been stern and undemocratic in his style, now consults with the masses on everything after the workers raised opinions about him.

    河南三百多个厂矿开始整风
    部分单位已经进入全面改进工作阶段
    据新华社郑州29日电  河南省有三百一十三个工矿及交通企业开始整风，一批先行单位，已经进入全面改进工作阶段。
    目前，郑州、洛阳、开封、焦作、鹤壁等八个城市和若干专区的几十万职工，正在大鸣大放。
    为了彻底改进工作，中共郑州市委最近决定，要做到人人把意见提尽、提透，不漏掉一条意见。据不完全的统计，各单位职工共提出意见二十多万条。
    在鸣放的同时，各单位都成立了专门改进工作的组织。郑州国棉三厂认真分析了工人们提出的意见以后，确定列入第一批解决的有一万多条。这个厂设立了改进工作措施栏，经常把已经解决的问题逐条公布出来。工人陈美华重提了积压二年多的“减少梭箱背板磨损”的合理化建议，技术人员认为建议很有价值，领导马上支持在二十台布机上进行试验。据了解，郑州市现在已经进入整风的七十九个单位，在国庆节前，可以解决各种大小意见数万条。
    职工们在鸣放中，提出的口号是“整风生产两不误”。9月上旬郑州国棉三厂在大鸣大放和改进工作的同时，有八个工区的工人出勤率达到百分之百，七个工区没有出次布。郑州铁路分局在鸣放高潮的十三天中，多运货五万吨。
    职工们诚恳地帮助党整风，增强了干部改进工作的决心。不少单位的党委书记和厂长，每天在大字报和“鸣放园地”前，抄下职工们的意见，做到及时整理、归纳和解决。科、室干部也普遍深入车间。一向态度生硬而作风又不民主的油脂化学厂修理车间主任李玉成，工人给他提出意见以后，现在他遇事就找群众商量。
