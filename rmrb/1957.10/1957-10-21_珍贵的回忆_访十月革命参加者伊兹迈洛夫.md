    Precious Memories
    —An Interview with October Revolution Participant Izmailov
    Soviet Union A. Rozhnov
    In an October Revolution exhibition hall of the Soviet Revolution Museum in Moscow, one can see a small, faded photograph. The photo shows a young sailor with dark eyebrows, a large beard, and a navy cap. This is Nikolai Izmailov, a sailor on the cruiser "Africa." He served as the Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet and, after October 1917, as its Chairman. The revolutionary Baltic sailors played a significant role in the struggle for the victory of Soviet power. We wanted to learn more about the life of Nikolai Izmailov, the leader of the revolutionary organization of Baltic sailors in those years, so we paid him a special visit.

    We visited Nikolai Izmailov while he was working. He was writing his memoirs about the revolutionary events that took place in the Baltic Fleet during the great October days.

    "At that time, the Baltic Fleet was a powerful armed force," the old Communist said. "We had more than 60,000 personnel and more than 500 battleships and auxiliary vessels. Thanks to the enormous political work carried out by the Communist Party among the broad masses of sailors, the majority of the Baltic Fleet sailors had been following the Bolsheviks even before the October Revolution."

    Lenin attached great importance to the Baltic Fleet in the proletarian revolutionary uprising and was convinced that the sailors were absolutely loyal to the cause of the proletarian revolution. At the end of September 1917, Lenin wrote a letter to Comrade Smilga, Chairman of the Army, Fleet, and Finnish Workers' Regional Committee in Helsingfors (now Helsinki). In this letter, Lenin raised the armed uprising as the most important issue of the day and assigned the task of overthrowing the Provisional Government to the troops stationed in Finland and the Baltic Fleet, along with the revolutionary forces of the Petrograd proletariat and the Petrograd garrison. During these days, the Baltic Fleet held its Second Congress. In accordance with Lenin's letter, the Congress formulated a specific program for all activities of the Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet, defining the mobilization of Baltic sailors to prepare for the upcoming armed uprising as the main task.

    Three days after receiving Lenin's letter, bloody battles broke out at sea. The German Kaiser's fleet, with more than 300 ships and 100 aircraft, launched an all-out attack on the Moon Sound archipelago. The Germans wanted to break into Petrograd and strangle the socialist revolution. The revolutionary Baltic sailors fought fiercely with the Kaiser's fleet for nine consecutive days. The Kaiser's fleet outnumbered the Russian navy several times over. Despite the betrayal of the Russian naval generals, the Baltic sailors showed extraordinary bravery in the battle. Twenty-five German warships were sunk and twenty-six were damaged. The Kaiser's fleet, suffering setbacks, failed to achieve its goals. In those memorable days, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet issued a "Declaration to the Oppressed People of the World!"

    "This is that declaration," Izmailov said, pulling out several old, yellowed sheets of paper from a folder.

    We read these unforgettable words from the declaration: "...The fleet is fulfilling the obligations of the great revolution. We guarantee to firmly hold the fleet and guard the gates of Petrograd. We do this not out of the orders of some pitiful Russian Napoleonists who want to undermine the resilience of the revolution with grace... We are confident that the revolution will win."

    The Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet began mobilizing the sailors to prepare for the armed uprising. Combat units were established on every warship, and loyal and reliable comrades were appointed as commanders. To arm these units, the Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet received 3,000 rifles, 5,000 grenades, ample ammunition, and 100 pistols from Moscow headquarters.

    On October 24, a telegram was received in Helsingfors: "Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet. Send down the drill book immediately." This was a code. Battleships and Baltic sailor detachments immediately set sail from Helsingfors to Petrograd, to be placed under the command of the Revolutionary Military Committee.

    "On October 25, we were busy all night with the intense assembly and arming of sailor detachments," Izmailov recalled. "That night, three trainloads of Baltic sailors arrived in Petrograd, totaling about 4,500 people. The Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet telegraphed orders to the cruiser 'Aurora,' the mine-laying ship 'Amur,' the Second Baltic and Naval Guard Replacements, and the detachment on Aegna Island, instructing them to all obey the Petrograd Soviet Revolutionary Committee. A total of fifteen battleships sailed from Helsingfors, Reval, and Kronstadt to Petrograd."

    Kerensky's troops occupied Gatchina and advanced towards Petrograd. The revolution faced a life-or-death crisis. On the night of October 28, the telephone rang on the "Polar Star" yacht, where the Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet was stationed. The Chairman of the Army, Fleet, and Finnish Workers' Regional Committee called Izmailov from the telegraph office. He said in an excited tone:

      "Please come to the telegraph office immediately. Lenin urgently needs you to send him a direct telegram."

    Sailor Izmailov put down the phone and quickly rushed to the telegraph office in the duty car. He stood in front of the telegraph machine, feeling very excited. The code paper had already transmitted Lenin's first, and as always, clear and specific question: "How many torpedo boats and other armed ships can you send?"

    Izmailov quickly and confidently replied that, in order to defend the revolution, the sailors could send one more "Republic" battleship and two torpedo boats. Lenin's questions came one after another. Izmailov answered them all. He telegraphed back to Lenin: "I confidently tell you that all the torpedo boats and the 'Republic' battleship we send will definitely defend the cause of the revolution. Please do not worry about sending armed forces. Absolute execution." Lenin then asked a question: "In how many hours?" Izmailov thought for a moment and replied that the ships would depart in no more than eighteen hours at most. "But, perhaps it is necessary to send them immediately?"

    "Yes," Lenin replied from Petrograd, "The government absolutely believes it is necessary to send them immediately, so that the battleship can enter the Morskoi Canal and sail as close to the shore as possible."

    In the telegram, Lenin instructed Izmailov on how to use the Baltic Fleet's battleships in the fight against the Kerensky-Krasnov gang. Lenin ended his telegram with these words: "Goodbye. Regards." The sailor happily and excitedly replied to Lenin: "Goodbye. Immediate execution of the task!"

    The revolutionary sailors of the Baltic Fleet gloriously carried out Lenin's orders. Together with the workers and revolutionary soldiers of Petrograd, they stood tall to defend the newly born Soviet Republic.

    Lenin's word "Goodbye" seemed like an appointment. A few days later, they met again. Izmailov and sailor Pavel Dybenko were summoned by Lenin to Smolny.

    They arrived at Lenin's office, where Lenin was on the phone. It was the first time Izmailov had seen the leader so close. After Lenin finished the call, he stood up, left the table, walked up to the two sailors, and greeted them. Dybenko introduced Izmailov to Lenin.

    Lenin briefly explained the difficult situation of the young Soviet Republic. The counter-revolutionary forces had cut off the sources of food and coal. The workers in Petrograd and Moscow were starving.

      "How many more sailors can the Baltic Fleet send to defend the revolution?" Lenin asked.

    This question was very important and needed to be discussed by the Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet in order to tap as much strength as possible to fulfill the Party's task. The two sailors told Lenin this.

    "Well, comrades, go to Helsingfors and solve this important problem," Lenin said at parting. "The Soviet government is waiting for the Baltic sailors."

    Izmailov, the former sailor, said, recalling those heroic years, "Soon, we sent another detachment of a thousand sailors to defend the revolution..."

    Those historically significant days were forty years ago. The world's first socialist country has traversed a glorious path in these forty years. During these forty years, Nikolai Izmailov's life has also undergone many changes. He served as the commander of the Black Sea and Azov Sea navies. Later, this former sailor devoted much effort to developing the Soviet Union's tractor industry. Now, Izmailov has retired. However, he has never stopped his connection with the sailors. Whenever he goes to warships and ports, he tells the sailors the story of the October Revolution and the leader of the Party and the revolution—the great Lenin.

    珍贵的回忆
    ——访十月革命参加者伊兹迈洛夫
    苏联  阿·罗日诺夫
    在莫斯科苏联革命博物馆的一个十月革命展览大厅里，可以看到一幅年深日久、已经褪了色的小照片。这幅照片拍的是一个黑眉毛，大胡子，头戴海军帽的年轻水兵。这就是“非洲号”巡洋舰上的水兵尼古拉·伊兹迈洛夫。他担任过波罗的海舰队中央委员会的副主席，1917年十月以后为该委员会主席。革命的波罗的海水兵，在争取苏维埃政权胜利的斗争中，起了巨大的作用。我们想更详细地了解一下尼古拉·伊兹迈洛夫这位当年波罗的海水兵革命组织领导人的生活情况，特地去访问了他。
    我们去访问时，正赶上尼古拉·伊兹迈洛夫在工作。他在写有关波罗的海舰队在伟大的十月日子里发生的革命事件的回忆。
    “当时，波罗的海舰队是一支强大的武装力量，”这位老共产党员讲道：“我们全体人员有六万多人，有五百多只战斗舰和辅助舰艇。由于共产党在广大的水兵群众中进行了巨大的政治工作，大多数的波罗的海舰队的水兵，早在十月革命以前就是跟着布尔什维克走的。”
    在无产阶级革命起义中，列宁非常重视波罗的海舰队，并且深信水兵们绝对忠于无产阶级革命事业。1917年9月底，列宁给在赫尔森福斯（即今之赫尔辛基）的军队、舰队和芬兰工人地区委员会主席斯米尔基同志写了一封信。列宁在这封信里，提出武装起义是当前最重要的问题，并且给驻在芬兰的军队和波罗的海舰队连同彼得格勒无产阶级和彼得格勒城防军的革命部队，提出了推翻临时政府的任务。在这些日子里，波罗的海舰队举行了第二次代表大会。大会遵照列宁这封信，制定了波罗的海舰队中央委员会全部活动的具体纲领，确定发动波罗的海水兵准备迎接行将到来的武装起义为主要的任务。
    在接到列宁来信的第三天，海上掀起了浴血的战斗。拥有三百多只舰艇、一百架飞机的德国凯皆尔舰队，几乎全部出动，向蒙忠德群岛进攻。德国人想冲进彼得格勒，扼杀社会主义革命。革命的波罗的海水兵同凯皆尔舰队进行的激战，一连持续了九天。凯皆尔舰队的兵力超过俄国海军好几倍。尽管俄国海军的将军们倒戈叛变，但波罗的海水兵们却在战斗中表现得英勇异常。德国军舰被击沉二十五艘，击伤二十六艘。遭到挫伤的凯皆尔舰队，未能实现它的企图。在那值得纪念的日子里，波罗的海舰队的水兵们发布了“告全世界被压迫人民！”宣言。
    “这就是那个宣言，”伊兹迈洛夫从文件夹里抽出几张年久已发黄了的纸说。
    我们从宣言上读到这些令人难忘的词句：“……舰队在执行大革命的义务。我们保证坚定不移地掌握住舰队，并且守住彼得格勒的大门。我们这样做，决不是出自某些可怜的俄国拿破仑主义者的命令。这些人想用恩典来瓦解革命的坚忍精神……我们确信，革命必胜。”
    波罗的海舰队中央委员会，开始发动水兵准备迎接武装起义。每一艘军舰上都建立了战斗部队，任命忠实可靠的同志担任指挥员。为了武装这些部队，波罗的海舰队中央委员会从莫斯科总部领到了三千支步枪、五千枚手榴弹、充足的弹药和一百只手枪。
    10月24日，赫尔森福斯收到了一封电报：“波罗的海舰队中央委员会。即将操典寄下。”这是密码。战斗舰和波罗的海水兵队伍，即刻从赫尔森福斯开往彼得格勒，接受革命军事委员会指挥。
    “10月25日我们彻夜忙于紧张的集合和武装水兵队伍，”伊兹迈洛夫回忆道，“这一晚上，开到彼得格勒的波罗的海水兵有三火车，总数大约四千五百人左右。波罗的海舰队中央委员会用电报向‘阿芙乐尔号’巡洋舰、‘黑龙江号’水雷敷设舰、第二波罗的海和海军近卫补充队以及艾杰尔岛上的分遣队下达了一项命令，全体一律听从彼得格勒苏维埃革命委员会的指挥。从赫尔森福斯、列维里和喀琅施塔得开赴彼得格勒的战斗舰，一共有十五艘。”
    克伦斯基的部队占领了戈特齐纳，并向彼得格勒挺进。革命面临着生死存亡的关头。10月28日夜里：在波罗的海舰队中央委员会驻在的“北极星号”快艇上，传来了一阵电话铃声。军队、舰队和芬兰工人地区委员会主席，从电报局给伊兹迈洛夫打来了电话。他用激动的语调说：
      “请您马上到电报局来。列宁火速叫您打直通电报给他。”
    水兵伊兹迈洛夫放下电话听筒后，就乘值班的汽车很快地赶到电报局。他站在电报机前，心情很激动。电码纸条已经传来了列宁的第一个和往常一样明确而具体的问题：“你们能派出多少水雷艇及其它有武装的舰只？”
    伊兹迈洛夫迅速而满怀信心地回答说，为了保卫革命，水兵们还能增派一艘“共和国号”主力舰和两艘水雷艇。列宁的问题一个接着一个。伊兹迈洛夫都作了回答。他给列宁拍了回电：“我有把握地告诉您，我们派遣的全部水雷艇和‘共和国号’主力舰，定会保卫革命的事业。派遣武装力量一事，请勿过虑。绝对执行。”列宁又提出一个问题：“过几个小时？”伊兹迈洛夫想了一下回答说，最多不超过十八个小时舰艇就出动。但是，或许现在马上就有必要派出吗？”
    “是的，”列宁从彼得格勒回答说，“政府绝对认为有必要即刻派遣，以便使主力舰开进莫尔斯克运河，尽可能驶近河岸。”
    列宁在电报中指示伊兹迈洛夫，在同克伦斯基—克拉斯诺夫匪帮作战中，如何利用波罗的海舰队的战斗舰。列宁用这样的话来结束他的电报：“再见。敬礼。”这位水兵愉快而又激动地回答列宁说：“再见。立即执行任务！”
    波罗的海的革命水兵们，光荣地执行了列宁的命令。他们和彼得格勒的工人、革命士兵一起，挺起胸膛来保卫刚刚诞生的苏维埃共和国。
    列宁说的“再见”那句话，好像是一个预约。过了几天，他们又会面了。伊兹迈洛夫和水兵巴维尔·第宾科一起由列宁在斯莫尔尼召见。
    他们来到了列宁的办公室，列宁正在打电话。伊兹迈洛夫在这样的近处看到领袖，还是第一次。列宁打完电话后，站了起来，离开桌子，走到两个水兵跟前，并向他们问好。第宾科向列宁介绍了伊兹迈洛夫。
    列宁简短扼要地说明了年轻的苏维埃共和国的艰难处境。反革命的军队切断了粮食、煤炭的来源。彼得格勒和莫斯科的工人在挨饿。
      “波罗的海舰队还能派出多少水兵来保卫革命？”列宁问道。
    这个问题十分重要，需要由波罗的海舰队中央委员会加以讨论，以便发掘尽可能多的力量来实现党的任务。两个水兵就这样告诉了列宁。
    “好吧，同志们，到赫尔森福斯去解决这个重要问题吧，”在告别时，列宁说道，“苏维埃政权在期待着波罗的海水兵们。”
    伊兹迈洛夫这位过去的水兵，在回忆当年英雄的年月时说道：“不久，我们又派了一支千人的水兵队伍去保卫革命……。”
    那些具有历史意义的日子，已经过了四十年。世界上第一个社会主义国家，在这四十年里经历了光荣的路程。在这四十年当中，就是尼古拉·伊兹迈洛夫的生活也起了很多变化。他担任过黑海和亚速海海军司令员。后来，这位过去的水兵，为发展苏维埃国家的拖拉机工业，又花了很多心血。现在，伊兹迈洛夫已经退休。但是，他从未间断过和水兵们的联系。每逢他到军舰和港口上的时候，他都向水兵们讲述十月革命以及党和革命的领袖——伟大列宁——的故事。
