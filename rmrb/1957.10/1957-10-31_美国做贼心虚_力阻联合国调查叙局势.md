    Trying to Prevent the UN from Investigating the Situation in Syria
    Xinhua News Agency, October 30th, dispatch from New York by TASS: The US delegation at the United Nations is trying every possible means to obstruct the UN General Assembly from adopting Syria's proposal to send a UN commission to investigate the threats to Syria's security.
    The US representative to the United Nations, Lodge, in a television speech on the evening of October 28th, advocated "not rushing into this matter." Lodge said that the United States has not lost hope that the King of Saudi Arabia will "mediate" the dispute between Syria and Turkey.
