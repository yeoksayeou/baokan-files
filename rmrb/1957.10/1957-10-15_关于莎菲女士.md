About Ms. Shafei
　　Zhang Tianyi
　　When Ding Ling's "Diary of Ms. Shafei" was published, it was right after the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War. However, Ms. Shafei's world seemed completely untouched by the storm of the great revolution. She didn't care about world affairs, nor did she worry about issues concerning the masses. Of course, she used her brain, she was distressed, and she pursued something, but all of this was for herself. In her world, she was the center: she struggled to live, just to enjoy more, "I want to make myself happy." She was willful and idle, and spent her main energy on playing with love – which can be said to be her only career. Here, the author meticulously described in the first person how she played with honest young men, how she pondered the so-called "techniques of love," and then passionately described how she tried to pursue a handsome man whose thoughts were unbearably vulgar but whose "appearance" was charming. In such "love," she felt contradiction and pain, because she recalled that she "temporarily lost all my self-esteem and pride." The ending of this novel is the tragedy of a self-centered person: she played with others, and the result was playing with herself.
　　Such a psychology and character are now not easily understood by young people in general. But at that time, many young intellectuals were familiar with Ms. Shafei. Some negated her and despised her. Some affirmed her and sympathized with her. Of course, at the same time, some felt it was novel and interesting, because such a woman had never appeared in Chinese works before – to speak so frankly, to write so meticulously and boldly about her own desires, how she played with love, and how she flaunted her charm.
　　As for the author herself, she affirmed and sympathized with this protagonist. Not only that, she was simply using Ms. Shafei's mouth to say her own words. Feng Xuefeng mentioned the author in the "Postscript to Ding Ling's Anthology" ("Anthology" Volume 1, page 101) in this way: "The author, who felt very much in common with Shafei and very strongly projected her own shadow into her, built her artistic foundation on this." I think this is a very understanding way of speaking about Ding Ling.
　　Then, does Ms. Shafei, into whom the author "projected her own shadow," count as a progressive figure at the time?
　　Ms. Shafei was also a product of the times: although she was not in tune with the great revolutionary movement at that time, she was still a character that could only emerge after the May Fourth Movement. Did the thoughts and feelings, demands and distress, etc., expressed by such a "new type of woman since the May Fourth Movement" have some progressive significance at the time? When we talk about the anti-traditional struggle of the May Fourth youth, we always have some respect. Even if some young men and women were only fighting for their own personal interests – for personal freedom, for the liberation of individuality, and the object of their struggle was only their own feudal family. But after all, they did strike a blow at feudalism from a certain aspect and to a certain extent. So this played a certain progressive role at the time. So, what about Ms. Shafei?
　　Ms. Shafei was born a little later, eight or nine years after the May Fourth Movement. In these eight or nine years, our Chinese society experienced so many events and was undergoing so many struggles – ideological and cultural struggles, political struggles, all the way to armed struggles – our history has completely spanned an era. Thus, this late-born Ms. Shafei, compared with the young intellectuals of the May Fourth Movement, had a very different mental outlook.
　　Here I recall an earlier work: Ms. Gan's "Isolation," published in "Creation Weekly." This was also a very noteworthy work at the time. It was also written in the first-person tone of the female protagonist. That Ms. Qinghua (the female protagonist) was the type of young person who fought against the old traditions during the May Fourth period. She fought against the feudal family to win personal freedom – specifically, to win her own freedom of love. Her body was imprisoned, but her spirit was not imprisoned. She said, "Life can be sacrificed, but freedom of will cannot be sacrificed. I would rather die than not have freedom." Although the meaning of this "freedom of will" was not very clear to her, and the so-called "freedom" only referred to the demands of personal life (without extending to the freedom of the generally oppressed), she still treated life seriously: she had pursuits and struggles. And her love with her lover was "pure and sacred," and thereby "permanently acknowledged that people's souls are indeed pure."
　　Ms. Shafei completely lacked this kind of thinking, this kind of spirit, and this kind of serious attitude towards life. In Ms. Shafei's view, Ms. Qinghua was inevitably too naive and too honest. That kind of character already seemed old and outdated.
　　These are simply two generations. The times of their birth are different, so the people are also different, and therefore the roles they played in history at that time are also different.
　　So, how did the previous generation develop into Ms. Shafei's generation?
　　Looking at the previous generation – like the young intellectuals of Ms. Qinghua's generation, they were still immature and not yet mature in all aspects. They wanted to break free from the shackles of the old traditions, just to win personal freedom and the liberation of individuality. As for what kind of person they would become after liberation, it was not very clear at this time, or they simply hadn't thought about it. For example, if Ms. Qinghua managed to break free from the feudal family, victory was victory, but what would happen afterwards? This successful couple would still have to live in this society in the future. What kind of thoughts would they have, what kind of actions would they take? What contradictions would there be between their lives and that social system, and how would they deal with these contradictions? What role would they play in this society?
　　All of this was still unknown. But as soon as they stepped out of the house and came into contact with the real life of society at that time, they encountered these problems – and watched them embark on a certain path.
　　There are all kinds of paths. Some can be walked, some cannot. They have to take one path, whether they consciously choose it or stumble upon it blindly.
　　Thus, a great division arose among these young intellectuals of the May Fourth era. These young people originally came from various classes and strata, and each had their own starting point. Once they participated in the struggle (cultural and ideological struggle to political struggle), the boundaries of each class became clearer and clearer, and the various camps became more and more distinct. At the same time, they saw "a specter" wandering in China – the specter of communism. Proletarian thought began to gain leadership. Thus, some embarked on the inevitable path required by Chinese history – this is what our current youth know, which is to move towards the revolutionary path of our new China. And those who did not embark on this path, or fundamentally opposed it, fell into other paths.
　　Let's say that one of them is the path of the bourgeoisie. During the May Fourth period, some bourgeois ideas and culture were introduced and accepted from abroad, most of which were from the revolutionary or ascending period of the bourgeoisie. At that time, taking them over played a certain progressive role. But after the fighters of this class went through several rounds of class struggle in China – especially after the First Domestic Revolutionary War – they became afraid of all progressive and revolutionary things, and even stood on the opposite side. At this time, the decadent trends of the reactionary world bourgeoisie, which had long been on its last legs, just happened to suit the tastes of this class in China. Thus, Chinese bourgeois thought (including "philosophy of life," etc.), viewpoints, and interests (including aesthetic tastes, etc.) were also shaped and matured, set after set, in the contradictory struggles of Chinese society at that time. And in terms of lifestyle, in addition to being stained with the decadent and rotten air that is inevitable for the general world bourgeoisie on its last legs, the Chinese bourgeoisie also had its own characteristics – this was the product of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial social conditions of China at that time: patriarchal air and rogue air.
　　With so much fertilizer, in the reactionary political climate at that time, various styles of contemporary bourgeois figures – although their class essence was the same, there were always various different schools, styles, postures, etc. – grew and were born.
　　And Shafei is one of these styles.
　　Therefore, Ms. Shafei is simply two different people compared to the previous generation like Ms. Qinghua. In Ms. Shafei, we certainly cannot see the traces of the old ethical constraints that the May Fourth youth inevitably carried, and at the same time, we cannot see even a little bit of the fighting spirit of the May Fourth period, the seriousness caused by the struggle, and the revolutionary spirit of exploring everything and re-evaluating all traditional things.
　　The role that Ms. Shafei played at this time is nothing like the role that the May Fourth youth played in those years: Ms. Shafei did not play any of the progressive roles that the May Fourth youth had played to varying degrees in those years.
　　This person has no ideals, no spiritual life, and no principles. She only thinks of herself. She wants to make herself happy and to enjoy something. The reason why she is afraid of death... no, "it's not that I'm afraid of death, it's just that I feel that I haven't enjoyed everything I have." She never cares about others, but only uses them when needed, and arbitrarily loses her temper, acts coquettishly, lies, and even plays with them according to her own likes and dislikes. But she wants others to care about her and be considerate of her. She wants to enjoy other people's "friendship." Therefore, she often blames people for "not understanding" her and "not empathizing" with her, which makes her dissatisfied and brings her to tears. She doesn't love honest boys like Weidi, but she enjoys his admiration and enjoys some of the pleasure of teasing him and making him suffer.
　　However, just doing this is not enough. She feels that this life is too empty and too mediocre. There must be something new – "just new, whether good or bad." Being in this world, you must constantly pursue something new to satisfy your desires – such as desire for profit, desire for fame, vanity, "will to power," and even sexual desire – and this last item is exactly what women of her current status and age should specialize in. Thus, she – "a completely feminine woman" – is always going to "conquer" "beautiful" men like Ling Jishi.
　　She herself admits that she is a "hard-hearted" selfish person. She mentions this in a direct tone, as objectively as one mentions one's own physiological characteristics. Originally, in the year that Ms. Shafei was born, the word "selfish" no longer sounded so jarring. Unlike in previous years – when Hu Shi advocated the "individualistic view of life," he inevitably had to cover it up and was embarrassed to admit that he and "selfish and self-interested egoism" (which is the essence) were of the same family. Ms. Shafei's behavior is precisely the practice of this "view of life," but she was born later, and this view of life developed further in the midst of contradictory struggles. Therefore, its essence was even more exposed, and it didn't matter to speak bluntly.
　　This certainly does not mean that Ms. Shafei has ever studied this "philosophy," or must have read "Hu Shi's Collected Works" or the like. Ms. Shafei may have read very few books of this kind, or she may not read any books at all (she probably read some translated novels at the time, which can be seen from the style she used in her diary). That doesn't matter. Although she hasn't studied it, she will spontaneously reach this realm by acting according to her nature. Because the root, that is, the "nature" of "acting according to nature," is the same. However, he is a doctor, knowledgeable, so he can explain a set of principles, and call it "philosophy," so that it can be used to preach to people. As for Ms. Shafei, she uses her own behavior and her own life to embody that kind of thinking and that kind of spirit – this is what we often talk about: visualization.
　　Now let's take another look at the career she is engaged in: let's see how she makes love.
　　Feng Xuefeng said that Ms. Shafei is a "believer in love above all else." This is probably because he saw that this thing had almost become the only content of her life, and that she had nothing else to do, so he gave her this hat. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that. However, her "believer in love above all else" is at least a little special. First of all, we see that she specializes in studying "small actions between men and women," studying how she can maintain her "sense of self-esteem," what kind of posture she should take on what occasion, whether to act coquettishly or lie, or what to do. That is to say, she loves to study "the techniques of love" – she does show her talent, her thinking ability and even her artistic expression ability in this regard. It's just that she loves to study this too much, to the point of putting the cart before the horse: she herself said that because she seems to "understand" and "know" too much about "small actions between men and women," she is "confused" about "love" itself, and even "doubts the 'love' that the world calls." Then, her "love above all else" has already devolved into the form of love above all else, just like those who only emphasize artistic techniques but are confused about ideological content. This is a formalism approach. Formalism is also one of the products of bourgeois culture on its last legs.
　　Secondly, Ms. Shafei has never taken this "supreme" love seriously, and has never had a serious attitude. This kind of person lacks true love that comes from the bottom of their heart. She certainly had a crush on Ling Jishi, but that wasn't love –
　　"Of course I won't love him. This not loving is easy to explain, that is, hiding inside his appearance is such a despicable soul!"
　　But she wants to "possess him" – doesn't love him, but wants to "possess him" – "wants him to offer his heart unconditionally." Thus, she puts all her intelligence to work for this great cause. "I put all my ingenuity on this, as if I were fighting with something. I want that thing, and I don't want to get it. I must design a way to have him send it up himself."
　　Why do that? Just because "that tall guy is really handsome," is a man whose soul is "despicable" but whose body is everywhere "beautiful." So "no matter how bad his thoughts are," she is also "so madly emotional." She is willing to die, "if he can hold me tightly, let me kiss his whole body, and then throw me into the sea, throw me into the fire..." Then she suddenly discovers: "Alas, I actually love him." So, what kind of "love" is this? She herself said that this is "being corrupted by the seduction of lust." When things develop to their peak, she sees his eyes "burning with the fire of lust," and she makes such mental preparations: "If he is limited to the satisfaction of carnal desires, then he can use his lust to destroy my heart." – But unexpectedly, the man takes it seriously and says to her "crying": "Shafei, believe me, I will not let you down!" This Shafei "couldn't help but laugh."
　　This is Ms. Shafei's "love" attitude and practice: to conquer others, to possess others, to play with others, to satisfy her own lust (even if only for a while). She had long had her own views on the content of "love": she once ridiculed a couple who did not live together because they were afraid of having children, saying that they were "ascetics." She wondered, "How could such a couple be born in the universe?" She couldn't figure it out: "Why wouldn't you need to embrace the naked body of your lover? Why suppress this expression of love?" So she "doesn't believe that love is so scientific, so rational!" – According to this, people born in the "universe" must act according to their instincts. Her so-called "love above all else" is just this kind of selfish thing to satisfy her own lust. This is also one of the signs of the decadent bourgeois culture on its last legs.
　　Let's take another look at the contradictions and distress she felt in "love."
　　The problem lies in her love object. That man, no matter how "despicable his soul" is, his body is always "beautiful." What she is "fascinated" by is this. In this way, the reason why she likes this object is only based on form. She is almost like an aestheticist. However, she is in pain. She feels that this damages her "sense of self-esteem." "He, Ling Jishi, such a despicable person, kissed me!" – On the one hand, she loves his physical beauty, and on the other hand, she feels that she has been devalued because of his "despicable soul." Here is a contradiction. This is not surprising: even if a person ignores the content of all things and only asks about their form, the content of things always exists, and even plays a decisive role. So whether he is happy or not, he will eventually have to deal with that content. Just like a writer, even if he doesn't ask about ideological content but only talks about artistry or artistic techniques, there is always an idea guiding his writing (and also guiding him to publish such an aesthetic theory), and he will always express a certain ideological content. Ms. Shafei also came into contact with that man's "pitiful thoughts" here. For example, what he needs "is money, and a young wife who can socialize with his business friends in the living room." His so-called love is only "to squander money in brothels and obtain a temporary sensual pleasure." His ambition is "to study at Harvard, become a diplomat, minister, or inherit his father's profession, do oak business, and become a capitalist..." He even doesn't look at the person he is talking to, and even says things to Ms. Shafei that make him enjoy the despicable pleasure, and the meaning of "making money and spending money." When he flatters Ms. Shafei, he actually says such things: "I will work hard to make money in the future." – So stupid!
　　Look, such a young master. So vulgar, and so vulgarly naive. However, he is really "beautiful": he not only has "a slender body, a fair face, thin lips, and soft hair," but also "another kind of indescribable and elusive charm to stir your heart," and also a "delicate attitude," and "eyes, manners" are also beautiful, in short, it is "a noble model." ... No wonder Ms. Shafei sighed: "Alas, poor man! Since God has endowed you with such a beautiful form, he secretly teases you and puts such an incompatible soul on top of your life!"
　　God is unkind, and actually created such a beauty whose content and form are absolutely contradictory! ... But wait! What kind of image is this person? What kind of "charm" does this person have? – This makes it very difficult to grasp. This is where the importance of Ling Jishi lies. But it is not described. Ms. Shafei is probably too attentive to herself, too fond of expressing herself. Therefore, she only writes authentically, vividly, and with good technique when she writes about herself and when she writes about her own reactions to the things around her, although there are still some rough spots in the language (which can be seen from the few original texts we quoted). Other than that, she is too lazy to write it seriously. Therefore, in this "diary," apart from Ms. Shafei herself, all the characters are written vaguely, and the writing technique suddenly disappears. It seems that these people only exist in the world for Shafei, and have no existence of their own – poor Ling Jishi can't escape this fate either. It can be seen that writing techniques are often inevitably changed with the changes in an author's thoughts and feelings.
　　Let's go back to the topic. If there is really such a man – in Ms. Shafei's view, his "charm" can "stir your heart," his "attitude," "eyes, and manners" are very beautiful, and he is a "noble model," but to think that this person is only "physical beauty" is wrong. Because a person's "charm," "attitude," "manners," etc. (which are different from things like "fair face, thin lips") are none other than the sum total of his thoughts, character qualities, lifestyle habits, education, etc., expressed externally. Ling Jishi is such a vulgar bourgeois young master, and after Ms. Shafei's contact with him, not only did she not feel anything disgusting about his "charm" and "attitude," but she found him "noble" and beautiful and fascinated her. Then, Ling Jishi must have had something in him – some things inside him – that just suited Ms. Shafei's tastes. There just happened to be something in her "soul" that was in tune with him. Otherwise, it wouldn't be reasonable.
　　However, she didn't realize this consciously, or she wouldn't admit it even if she did realize it. What, doesn't she clearly detest his vulgarity? Although his vulgarity was not what she felt, but what Ling Jishi himself confessed, didn't she immediately adopt a certain attitude after hearing and knowing that he had such a characteristic?
　　That's right. Ling Jishi's vulgarity is too blatant and too superficial. In other words, he is too naively vulgar. This is what Ms. Shafei, a person who thinks she is clever, cannot stand. Especially since she originally wanted to conquer this man, but unexpectedly was conquered by this man instead, which is simply an insult to her self-esteem, she can't stand it even more. This is where the contradiction lies.
　　In fact, this contradiction is not difficult to solve. It can be solved without Ms. Shafei changing her way of life or "philosophy of life." For example, if Ling Jishi learned to be a little smarter and changed the way he talked, don't say "making money and spending money" all the time – of course, money must be had, otherwise, if you are so poor that you are haggard and emaciated, Ms. Shafei will definitely not look up to you, but you might as well be more elegant, have money but "not talk about money," like the rich people of ancient times, and change it to "Atu things" or the like. At least in front of Ms. Shafei, you have to restrain yourself and don't show that she is associating with vulgar things. In addition, it is best to often use words like "life," "love," "loneliness," "no one understands me," and "the universe" in your conversations, but at the same time, you must pay attention not to really talk about any life issues or any other serious issues stupidly. In short, you have to feel Ms. Shafei's temper and study the "techniques of love." In this way, this Ling Jishi – whose beauty and "charm," "attitude, manners," etc. remain unchanged, and whose life status, character, thoughts, qualities, education, etc. also remain unchanged (otherwise, there would be no such "charm"), is just a little more implicit in his vulgarity and not so superficial, then things will be easy to handle. Then Ms. Shafei wouldn't be ashamed to "fascinate" with this kind of person, and the remaining question would only be how to "conquer him" and "possess him." As for what kind of life situation she would have after she achieved victory, there would be another contradiction, but that is another theme. But the current contradiction will no longer exist.
　　Originally, although all bourgeois young masters are inevitably vulgar (this is their essence), the way their vulgarity is expressed is different for each of them. The role that Ms. Shafei encountered this time is one of the most naive and blatant expressions. This is just a chance encounter. This is a contradictory conflict based on chance and individual events. This is not the real internal contradiction of the problem. She may accidentally encounter this kind of Ling Jishi (and feel a contradiction), or she may accidentally encounter another kind of Ling Jishi (and there will be no contradiction) – these are irrelevant, in short, what she loves is a handsome young master who has this "charm" and "attitude" (this is not a contradiction).
　　But of course, even if this is just an accidental and superficial contradictory conflict, and it happens in Ms. Shafei's personal little "universe," it will seem to be a remarkable and important issue. In the eyes of people like Ms. Shafei, this should always be a major theme that a writer should devote all his efforts to. Feng Xuefeng said: "The author has indeed written about the contradictions and sadness of Shafei, this young girl, in a very meticulous and thorough way, and it is indeed linked to very deep timeliness and sociality." The first "indeed" is easy to understand. As for the second "indeed," that is probably also a way of speaking about this issue from inside Ms. Shafei's little "universe" and using Ms. Shafei's set of viewpoints, psychology, vision, and tastes – it is definitely not the concept of "timeliness and sociality" that we usually talk about.
　　To say that the formation and existence of people like Ms. Shafei is "linked to" "timeliness and sociality" is understandable. We have already discussed this. There were indeed people like Ms. Shafei at that time. This is indeed the truth of life. But how does the author treat this kind of truth? What kind of views does he have? What attitude does he take?
　　We know that although Ms. Shafei is said to be a new product since the May Fourth Movement, she has none of the progressive spirit that the May Fourth youth had more or less at that time. What she has is the taste of the decadent bourgeoisie on its last legs. Therefore, some people negate her and despise her – but at the same time, it is precisely because of this that some people affirm her and like her. If these two kinds of people write about the same truth of life, they will write two very different works, and the role that the works play will also be very different. And the author of "Diary of Ms. Shafei" belongs to the latter kind of person, and is "very much in agreement with Shafei." And this work was born at such a time, just after the failure of the first revolutionary war in China, among the intellectuals who participated in or were inclined to the revolution (some of whom were originally May Fourth youth), some followed the team and plunged into more arduous and complex political struggles, ideological and cultural struggles, and even armed struggles; and some wavered, were depressed, decadent, and even betrayed the revolution – this trend just coincided with the decadent trend of the bourgeoisie. These were two opposing forces and two camps at that time. The two were launching a cultural and artistic struggle to win over the middle forces (most of whom were petty-bourgeois intellectuals). At such a time and in such a situation, the role played by a work like "Diary of Ms. Shafei" was not a progressive one, but quite the opposite.
　　What will happen to Ms. Shafei in the future? What is her way out? Will she participate in the revolution? Some people have pointed out that she can only go to the revolution. Feng Xuefeng also has this meaning in the "Postscript to Ding Ling's Anthology."
　　She may participate in the revolution. However, we know that if this kind of person really participates in the revolution, she must be reborn and become a different person. Not only must she completely get rid of her set of bourgeois "philosophy of life," individual-centered thinking, etc. – which is not easy; but more importantly, she must wash away that kind of bourgeois psychology, interest, mental state, and its expression in life, that kind of style, attitude towards people and things, habits, etc., which have permeated her entire "soul" – this is even more difficult, because this is often developed gradually and unconsciously, and then it is shaped and forms her character. If she has not changed or has changed but has not changed well, or has changed in some aspects but the root has not moved, or has only restrained some on the surface but is still the same in her bones, if this is the case, what will happen to her? This is directly contradictory to collective life and struggle life, so how will she live this kind of life? What will she do when the revolution is difficult, and what will she do when the revolution is smooth?
　　Moreover, what we said about this "not moving," "still the same," etc., only means that her ideology has not changed, not that it has truly stagnated. It will move, it will develop, but in this contradictory conflict with the surrounding environment, it has to use more tortuous and complex methods and ways to seek its own development. At the same time, its form of expression is of course different from the past. That is a completely different subject matter, a different theme: the nature of the problem is different.
　　So, what will happen to this Ms. Shafei?
　　Then, the many materials about Ding Ling's thoughts, words, and deeds revealed at a series of recent meetings against the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique – which are certainly far from complete – can be said to be the sequel to "Diary of Ms. Shafei."

专栏：

　　关于莎菲女士
　　张天翼
    丁玲的“莎菲女士的日记”出世的时候，正是第一次国内革命失败以后。可是莎菲女士所生活着的这个世界里，简直没挨着一点点大革命的风暴。她不关心什么世界大事，也不去操心什么有关人民群众的问题。她固然也动脑筋，也苦闷，也追求什么，可这都是为了她自己。在她的世界里只是以她自己为中心：她争取活着，只是为的要多享受些，“我要使我快乐。”她任性，无所事事，而把主要的精力花费在玩弄恋爱上面——这可以说是她的唯一事业。在这里，作者用第一人称精细地描写她怎样耍弄老实的男孩子，怎样琢磨所谓“爱的技巧”，接着又充满热情地描写她怎样设法追求一个思想俗不可耐而“丰仪”好得迷人的美男子，而她在这样的“恋爱”里又怎样感到了矛盾和痛苦，因为她想起她“临时失掉了我所有的一些自尊和骄傲”。这篇小说的结局就是一个自我中心主义者的悲剧：她玩弄别人，结果是玩弄了自己。
    这么一种的心理，性格，现在一般青年都不很容易理解了。可是在那个时候，很多青年知识分子是熟悉莎菲这号人的。有的否定她，鄙视她。有的却肯定她，同情她。当然，同时也有的是感到新奇有趣，因为中国作品里还没有出现过这样的女人——来这样现身说法，来这样精细而又大胆地写出自己的情欲，写出自己怎样玩弄恋爱，怎样卖弄风情。
    至于作者自己，那是肯定和同情这个主人公的。不但如此，她还简直是在借莎菲女士的嘴来说自己的话。冯雪峰在“丁玲文集后记”（“论文集”第一卷101面）这么样提起作者：“和莎菲十分同感而且非常浓重地把自己的影子投入其中去的作者，在这上面建立自己的艺术的基础的作者”。我以为这是很了解丁玲的讲法。
    那么，作者“把自己的影子投入其中”的这位莎菲女士，究竟算不算是一种进步人物，在当时？
    莎菲女士这号人也是一种时代的产物：她同当时的大革命运动虽然不通气，可到底也是五四以后才会出现的角色。这么一个“五四以来的新型女性”，她所表现的思想和感情，要求和苦闷等等，在当时有没有一些进步意义？我们现在谈起五四青年当年那种反传统的斗争来，总是带着几分敬意的。哪怕其中有一部分男女青年只不过是为了自己个人而斗争——为了个人的自由，为了要使个性得到解放，斗争对象不过是自己的封建家庭。可是他们到底也从一定的方面，在一定的程度上打击了封建主义。所以这在当时也起了一定的进步作用。那么莎菲女士呢？
    莎菲女士出世得晚了些，离五四运动已经八、九年了。在这八、九年中间我们中国社会经过了那么多事变，经过而且还正在进行那么多斗争——思想文化斗争，政治斗争，一直到武装斗争，——我们的历史整整跨过了一个时代。这么着，这个晚出的莎菲女士，同五四运动时期的青年知识分子一比，那精神面貌就很不一样了。
    这里我想起了一篇较早的作品来：淦女士在“创造周报”上发表的“隔绝”。这在当时也是很受注意的一篇作品。也是用女主人公的第一人称口气写的。那位?华女士（女主人公）就是五四时期对旧传统作斗争的那号青年。她为了争取个人的自由——具体说是争取自己的恋爱的自由，而同封建家庭作斗争。她身子被囚禁住了，但她精神没有被囚禁得住。她说“身命可以牺牲，意志自由不可以牺牲，不得自由我宁死。”虽然这“意志自由”的含义在她还不很明确，而所谓“自由”，不过指的是个人生活上的要求（没有推及一般被压迫者的自由），可是她究竟是严肃地对待生活的：有所追求，有所斗争。而她和爱人的恋爱是“纯洁神圣的”，并由此而“永久的承认人们的灵魂的确是纯洁的”。
    莎菲女士可就完全没有这种思想这种精神，也没有这种对生活的严肃态度。在莎菲女士看来，那?华女士之为人就未免太天真太老实了。那种人物已经显得陈旧了，过了时了。
    这简直是两代人。出世的时期不同，人也就不同，因此对当时历史所起的作用也就各不相同。
    那么，从前一代怎么样发展到莎菲女士这一代来的？
    看看前一代——像?华女士那一代的青年知识分子，在各方面都还幼稚，还没有成熟，没有定型。他们要挣脱旧传统的束缚，只是为了争取个人的自由，争取个性的解放，至于解放了以后将来要成为怎么样的人，这时候还不很明确，或者还简直没有想到。比如说，?华女士要是从封建家庭里挣脱了出来，胜利是胜利了，以后怎么办呢？这一对成功了的爱人以后仍然得在这个社会里生活下去，那他们会有怎样的思想，会有怎样的行动？他们的生活同那个社会制度之间会有些什么矛盾，而他们又将怎样对待这些矛盾？他们在这个社会里会起什么作用，会演一个什么角色？
    这一切都还不知道。可是他们一走出家门，一接触到当时社会的现实生活，就碰上这些问题了——看他走上一条什么路。
    有种种道路。有的走得通，有的走不通。他总得走上一条，不管他自觉选上的也好，或是胡里胡涂碰上的也好。
    于是在五四时代的这些青年知识分子中间，起了一个大分化。这些青年本来就是来自各个阶级各个阶层的，又是各有各的出发点。一参加到斗争（文化思想斗争以至政治斗争），各个阶级的界线就越斗越清楚，各个阵营越斗越分明了。同时就看见“一个怪影”在中国游荡着——共产主义的怪影。无产阶级思想开始取得了领导权。于是有的就走上了中国历史所要求的这条必然的道路——这是我们现在的青年都知道了的，就是走向我们新中国的革命的道路。而有的没走上这条路，或根本反对走这条路，就落到了别的一些道儿上了。
    且说其中有一条，是资产阶级的道儿。五四时期也曾从外国介绍和接受了一些资产阶级的思想文化，那多半是些资产阶级革命期或是上升期的东西，在当时拿过来是起一定的进步作用的。可是这个阶级的战士在中国的阶级斗争经过了几个回合之后——尤其是经过了第一次国内革命之后，就对一切进步的革命的东西都害怕起来，甚至站到反对的那一面去了。这时候，那早已走末运的反动的世界资产阶级的那些颓风，就刚好对上中国这个阶级的口味。这么着，中国的资产阶级思想（包括“人生哲学”什么的），观点，兴趣（包括美学趣味什么的），就也在当时中国社会的矛盾斗争当中，一套一套地定型了，成熟了。而在生活作风上面，除开染上了一般世界资产阶级走末运所不可免的颓废气和腐烂气而外，中国资产阶级还有中国资产阶级自己的特点，——这是当时半封建半殖民地的中国社会条件的产物：家长气和流氓气。
    有了这么些肥料，在当时反动的政治气候里，于是就有各种样式的当今的资产阶级人物——阶级本质虽是同一的，但总也有各种不同的流派，方式，姿态等等——成长了，出世了。
    而莎菲这个人是其中的一种样式。
    所以莎菲女士比起?华女士那样的前一代来，就简直是两号人物。我们在莎菲女士身上，固然看不到五四青年身上所不免带着的那些旧礼教束缚的痕迹，同时也看不到她有一点点五四时期的那种斗争性，那种因斗争而有的严肃性，以及那种探究一切，要把所有传统东西都重新估价的革命精神。
    莎菲女士在她这个时候所演的角色，一点也不像五四青年在当年所演的角色：莎菲女士一点也没有相当于五四青年在当年所多多少少起过的那些进步作用。
    这个人没有什么理想，没有什么精神生活，也没有什么原则。她只是想到自己。想要使自己快乐，使自己能够享受些什么。她之所以怕死……不，“不是我怕死，是我总觉得我还没有享有我的一切。”她从来不关心别人，只是在需要的时候支使一下别人，并且凭自己的喜怒任意对他们发脾气，撒娇，扯谎，以至玩弄他们。可是她要别人关心她，体贴她，她要享有人家的“友情”，因此她经常怪人家“不了解”她，“不体会”她，而使她不满，流泪。她不爱苇弟那样的老实男孩子，可是她享受他的爱慕，并从中享受一些逗弄他而使他痛苦的乐趣。
    然而光只是这样还不行。她感到这生活太空虚太平庸了，总得有点儿新的什么玩意儿才好——“只是新的，无论好坏”。人生在世，总得不断追求一点儿新的什么来满足自己的欲望——例如利欲，名欲，虚荣心，“权力意志”，以至情欲，——而最后这一门恰恰是像她现在这种地位和这种年龄的女人所要专门从事的。于是她——“一个女性十足的女人”总是这么着——要去“征服”凌吉士那样的“美”男子。
    她自己承认她是个“硬心”的自私的人。她用直述语气提到了这一点，就好像一个人提到自己的生理特征似的那么客观。原来在莎菲女士出世的那年头儿，“自私”这个词儿听起来已经不显得那么触耳了，不比往年——往年胡适提倡“个人主义的人生观”的时候还不免要遮遮掩掩，不好意思承认他和“自私自利的为我主义”（这才是实质）是一家。莎菲女士的为人就正是这种“人生观”的实践，只是她较为晚出，这种人生观也就在矛盾斗争当中更往前发展了些，因而它那个实质也就更暴露出来了些，竟不妨直言无讳就是了。
    这当然不是说莎菲女士曾经研究过这号“哲学”，或是一定曾经读过“胡适文存”之类。莎菲女士也许很少读这类书籍，也许她根本任什么书也不大读（大概读过一些当时的翻译小说，这从她日记里所用的那号文体可以看出来）。那并没有关系。她虽然没研究过，可她率性而行，也会自发地达到这一境界。因为那个根子，也就是“率性”的那个“性”，是同一的。不过人家是博士，有学问，所以讲得出一番道理，而名之曰“哲学”，好拿来对人布道宣讲。而莎菲女士呢，她是用自己的为人，用自己的生活，来体现出那种思想那种精神的——这就是我们常说起的：形象化。
    现在我们再来看看她所做的事业：看看她怎么样闹恋爱。
    冯雪峰说莎菲女士是个“恋爱至上主义者”。这大概由于看见这个玩意儿几乎成了她生活的唯一内容，此外即无所事事，所以就送她这么一顶帽子的吧。那当然没有什么不可以。不过她这个“恋爱至上主义者”至少有点儿特别。首先，我们看见她专喜研究“男女间的小动作”，研究自己怎么才能维持住“自尊之心”，自己在什么场合该取什么姿态，撒娇呢还是扯谎呢，还是该怎么着。这就是说，她爱钻研“爱的技巧”，——她在这方面的确显出了她的才能，她的思维能力以至艺术表现能力。只是她太爱钻研这个了，以至于有点舍本求末：她自己说，因为对“男女间的小动作”似乎“看得太明白了”，太“懂得了”，对于“爱”本身就反倒“迷糊”起来，并且还“会怀疑到世人所谓的‘爱’”。那么，她这个“恋爱至上”已经是流于恋爱形式至上了，好像那些只讲求艺术技巧而对思想内容反而迷糊起来的人一样。这是一种形式主义搞法。形式主义也是走到末运的资产阶级文化的产品之一。
    其次，莎菲女士对待这个“至上”的恋爱可从来没有认过真，没有一点点严肃的态度。这号人缺少那种从心底里出来的真正的爱。她对凌吉士的确动了心，可那并不是爱，——
    “自然我不会爱他，这不会爱，很容易说明，就是在他丰仪的里面是躲着一个何等卑丑的灵魂！”
    可是她要“占有他”——不爱他，但要“占有他”，——“要他无条件的献上他的心”。于是她把她所有的智力都拿来服务于这个大事业。“我是把所有的心计都放在这上面用，好像同着什么东西搏斗一样。我要着那样东西，我还不愿去取得，我务必想方设计的让他自己送上来。”
    干么要这样？就因为“那高个儿可真漂亮”，是个灵魂“卑丑”而肉体无处不“美”的男人。所以“无论他的思想是怎样坏”，她却也“如此癫狂的动情”。她死都愿意，“假使他能把我紧紧的拥抱着，让我吻遍他的全身，然后把我丢下海去，丢下火去……”于是她忽然发现：“唉，我竟爱他了。”那么，这又是什么样的一种“爱”呢？她自己说，这是“被一种色的诱惑而堕落”。等事情发展到顶点的时候，她看见他的眼光“被情欲之火燃烧得如何的怕人”，她就作好了这样的精神准备：“倘若他只限于肉感的满足，那末他倒可以用他的色来摧残我的心。”——可是不料那个男的却认起真来了，“哭声的”向她说：“莎菲，你信我，我是不会负你的！”这位莎菲就“竟忍不住而笑出声来”。
    这就是莎菲女士的“恋爱”态度和实践：征服别人，占有别人，玩弄别人，来满足自己的情欲（哪怕是一时的也好）。她对于“爱”的内容原来早就有了她自己的看法：她曾经嘲笑一对因为怕生小孩而不住在一起的夫妇，说他们是“禁欲主义者”。她诧异：“宇宙间竟会生出这样的一对人来”！她想不通：“为什么会不需要拥抱那爱人的裸露的身体？为什么要压制住这种爱的表现？”所以她“不相信，恋爱是如此的科学，如此的理智！”——准此，“宇宙间”生出的人自必该按照本能办事的了。她的所谓“恋爱至上主义”就只是这么一种自私的满足自己的情欲的东西。这也是走到末运的堕落的资产阶级文化的征候之一。
    我们再看看她在“恋爱”中所感到的矛盾和苦闷吧。
    问题在于她那个恋爱对象。那个男人，不论他有“何等卑丑的灵魂”，他的形体总是“美”的。她所“迷恋”的就是这个。这么说来，她之所以看上这个对象，也只是凭形式的了。她简直有点儿像唯美主义者。然而她有痛苦。她觉得这是损害了她的“自尊之心”。“他，凌吉士，这样一个可鄙的人，吻我了！”——一方面她爱他的肉体美，一方面又因他的“卑丑的灵魂”而使她感到自己给贬低了。这里就有了矛盾。这是难怪的：一个人尽管不理会一切事物的内容而只问其形式，可是事物的内容总归是存在着，而且甚至还要起决定作用的。所以无论他高兴不高兴，他终于不得不跟那个内容打交道。正好像一个作家尽管不问思想内容而只讲艺术性或艺术技巧，可是总归有一种思想在那里指导他写作（也指导他发表这么一号美学理论），总归会表现出一定的思想内容来。莎菲女士在这里也就接触到那个男人的“可怜的思想”。例如，他需要的“是金钱，是在客厅中能应酬他买卖中朋友们的年青太太”。他的所谓爱情，只“是拿金钱在妓院中，去挥霍而得来的一时肉感的享受”。他的志愿是“留学哈佛，做外交官，公使大臣，或继承父亲的职业，做橡树生意，成资本家……”他甚而至于不看谈话对象，连对莎菲女士也“说着那些使他津津有味的卑劣享乐，以及‘赚钱和花钱’的人生意义”。他对莎菲女士讨好的时候，居然还说出这样的话：“我以后要努力赚钱呀。”——真蠢极了！
    瞧，就这么一位大少爷。就这么庸俗，而且庸俗得这么幼稚。然而他真“美”：他不单是有“颀长的身躯，白嫩的面庞，薄薄的小嘴唇，柔软的头发”等等，并且还“另有一种说不出，捉不到的丰仪来煽动你的心”，还有一副“娇贵的态度”，而“眼神，举止”也都美，总之是“一种高贵的模型”。……怪不得莎菲女士要叹气了：“唉，可怜的男子！神既然赋与你这样一副美形，却又暗暗的捉弄你，把那样一个毫不相称的灵魂放到你人生的顶上！”
    上帝不仁，竟造了这么一个内容和形式绝对相矛盾的美人！……可是且慢！这个人究竟是怎么一个形象？这个人究竟有怎么一种“丰仪”？——这就叫人很难捉摸了。这是凌吉士这个人物的重要所在。可是没有描写出来。莎菲女士大概是太注意自己了，太爱表现自己了，所以只有写到自己的时候，以及写到自己对周围事物的反应的时候，才写得道地，生动，技巧也不错，虽然语言文字上还有些纥里纥繨（这从我们引用不多的原文里也可以看出来）。除此以外，她可就懒得去认认真真写它了。所以在这部“日记”里，除开莎菲女士自己一个人而外，所有的人物都写得模糊，写作技术也忽然不见了。好像这些人只是为莎菲而生存于世，而没有自己的存在似的，——可怜凌吉士也逃不出这一命运。可见写作技巧往往也不免随着一个作者的思想感情的变化而有所变化的。
    话再说回来。要是真有这么一位男人——在莎菲女士看来，他的“丰仪”能“煽动你的心”，“态度”，“眼神，举止”都很漂亮，是“高贵的模型”，而认为这个人光只是“肉体美”，那可就不对头了。因为一个人的“丰仪”，“态度”，“举止”等等（这和“白嫩的面庞，薄薄的小嘴唇”之类不同），不是别的，恰恰正是他的思想，性格品质，生活习惯，教养等等的总和而表现于外的东西。像凌吉士那么一个庸俗得非常露骨的资产阶级大少爷，莎菲女士和他接触之下，不但一点也没有感到他那“丰仪”“态度”里面有什么令她生厌的东西，倒是觉得“高贵”美丽而令她着迷，那么，一定是凌吉士那号人本人——他内在的一些什么东西，正好合上了这位莎菲女士的口味。她“灵魂”里面恰好有和他同调的玩意儿。否则，就不合理。
    不过这一点她没有自觉到，即或觉到了她也不肯承认。怎么，她不是分明憎恶他的庸俗的么？虽然他的庸俗并不是她感觉出来的，而是凌吉士自己表白出来的，可是她一经听取而知道了他有这么一个特点之后，她立刻就采取了一定的态度，不是么？
    不错。凌吉士的那种庸俗实在太露骨了，太表面化了。也就是说，他庸俗得太幼稚了。这是莎菲女士这号自以为高明的人所受不了的。尤其是她本想征服这个男人，却不料反而被这个男人所征服，这简直是侮辱了她的自尊心，就更加受不了。这就是矛盾的所在。
    其实呢，这个矛盾并不难解决。用不着莎菲女士改换什么生活的道路或“人生哲学”，就可以解决。比如说吧，要是凌吉士稍为学得聪明点儿，改变一下子谈话的方式，别口口声声“赚钱花钱”什么的——当然，钱是要有的，要不然穷得面黄饥瘦，那莎菲女士决看不上眼，但不妨雅一点，虽有钱而“口不言钱”，像古之富翁一样，而改称为“阿堵物”之类。至少在莎菲女士面前要收敛一些，别显出她是在与俗物为伍。此外最好还在谈话里经常使用“人生”呀，“爱情”呀，“寂寞”呀，“不了解我”呀，“宇宙之间”呀这些个词儿，但同时又千万要注意，别傻里不机地真去谈什么人生问题以及其他认认真真的什么问题。总之，要摸一摸莎菲女士的脾气，要考究一下“爱的技巧”。这么着，这个凌吉士——其美貌和“丰仪”“态度，举止”等等原封不动，生活地位，性格，思想，品质，教养等等也原封不动（否则就不会有这样的“丰仪”），只是俗得含蓄一点儿，不那么表面化，那么事情就好办了。那么莎菲女士就不至于以“迷恋”这号人为丢脸了，剩下的问题就只是怎么样去“征服他”而“占有他”。至于她要是取得胜利以后，又将会有怎么样的生活情况，那自又有一种矛盾要发生，可那是另一个主题。但目前这个矛盾却总不再存在了。
    原来资产阶级大少爷们虽然全都不免庸俗（这是他们的本质），但其庸俗的表现形式，是各有不同的。莎菲女士这回碰到的这位角色，是其中表现得最幼稚最露骨的一种。这不过是个偶然的遭遇。这是建立在偶然和个别事件上的矛盾冲突。这并不是问题的真正的内部矛盾。她可能偶然遇到这一种凌吉士（就会感到有矛盾），也可能偶然遇到另一种凌吉士（就不会有矛盾）——这都不相干，总之她爱的是有这种“丰仪”“态度”的漂亮大少爷（这一点是没有矛盾的）。
    但当然，即使这不过是一种偶然的表面的矛盾冲突，而它一发生在莎菲女士个人的小“宇宙”里，却也会显得是了不起的重要问题。在莎菲女士这种人的眼皮子下面，这总该是一个作家应全力以赴的重大主题了。冯雪峰说：“作者把莎菲这少女的矛盾和伤感，的确写得可谓入微尽致，而且也的确联带着非常深刻的时代性和社会性。”这第一个“的确”容易了解。至于第二个“的确”，那大概也是待在莎菲女士的那个小“宇宙”里，并用了莎菲女士的那套观点，心理，眼界和趣味来看这个问题的一种讲法，——决不是我们通常所说的“时代性和社会性”的那种概念。
    要说莎菲女士这种人物之所由形成和存在，是“联带着”“时代性和社会性”，那倒是讲得通的。这我们已经讨论过了。在那时的确是有过像莎菲女士这样的人。这倒的确是生活的真实。但作者怎样对待这样的真实？他有怎样的看法？他采取什么态度？
    我们知道，莎菲这号人虽说是五四以来的新产物，可是在她身上连一点点五四青年在当时或多或少的那种进步气都没有了，有的是末路颓废的资产阶级气味。因此有人否定她，鄙视她，——但同时正因此而也有人肯定她，喜欢她。让这两种人写起这同一个生活的真实来，就会写出大不相同的两种作品，而作品所起的作用也就大不相同。而“莎菲女士的日记”的作者是属于后一种人，并且是“和莎菲十分同感”的。而这篇作品是在这么一个时候出世的，刚刚在国内第一次革命战争失败之后，参加革命或是倾向革命的知识分子（一部分原是五四青年）中间，有的跟上了队伍，投入更艰苦更复杂的政治斗争，思想文化斗争，以至武装斗争；而有的则动摇，消沉，颓废，甚至叛变了革命，——这一股同资产阶级那股颓风正好合上了流。这是当时正相对立的两种势力，两个阵营。这两者正为争取中间势力（大部分是小资产阶级性的知识分子）而展开了文化艺术的斗争。在这么一个时候，在这么一种情势里，“莎菲女士的日记”这么一种作品所起的作用就不是进步作用，而恰恰是相反的作用。
    莎菲女士这号人以后会怎么样？出路如何？她会不会去参加革命？有人指出过，她只有去革命。冯雪峰在“丁玲文集后记”里也就有这样的意思。
    她可能去参加革命。不过这号人要真去参加革命的话，那我们知道，她必得脱胎换骨地另做一个人才行。不但她那套资产阶级的“人生哲学”，个人中心主义思想之类都得彻底去掉，——这可不容易；还有更重要的，她得把浸透了她整个“灵魂”的那种资产阶级心理，兴趣，精神状态，及其表现在生活上的那种种作风，对人对事的态度，习惯等等，也要通通洗掉，——这可就更难些了，因为这往往是在不知不觉之间渐渐发展，而至于定型，形成了她的性格的。要是她没有改或是改而没有改好，或是虽然改了某些方面而根子没有动，或只是表面上收敛了一些而骨子里依然如故，要是这么着，那她将会怎么样？这是同集体生活斗争生活正相矛盾的，那她怎么样过这种生活？她在革命困难的时候会怎么样，在革命顺利的时候又会怎么样？
    况且我们所说的这个“不动”，“依然如故”等等，只是说她的思想意识没有转变，并非真正停滞不动。它会要动，会要发展，只是在同周围的这种矛盾冲突中，它不得不用更曲折更复杂的方法和方式来求得自己的发展就是了。同时，其表现形式也当然和从前的不同了。那就完全是另一个题材，另一种主题：问题的性质不同了。
    那么，这个莎菲女士将会怎么样呢？
    那么，近来在反对丁陈反党集团的一连串会议上所揭露的关于丁玲思想言行的那许多材料——当然还远不完备——可以说是“莎菲女士日记”的续篇。
