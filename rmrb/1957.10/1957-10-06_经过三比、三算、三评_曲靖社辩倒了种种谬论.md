　　According to this newspaper, the Qujing United Cooperative in Yunnan Province adopted the method of "three comparisons, three calculations, and three evaluations" to launch a major debate, establish righteousness, and promote production.

　　During the period of "blooming and contending," the cooperative raised many opinions on the grain issue. These opinions were ostensibly directed at rations, but in essence, they involved whether socialism was necessary and whether cooperatives were superior. Therefore, they first conducted "three comparisons": "Comparing whether capitalism, feudalism, or socialism is better." At the meeting, members recalled the exorbitant taxes and levies before liberation, such as land rent, cultivated land tax, prisoner grain, borrowing grain, and the "big package rice" demanded by the Kuomintang army, totaling more than twenty kinds. The peasants lived inhuman lives; in the ten years or so before liberation, thirty-one people starved to death, thirty-one died while fleeing famine, and twenty-three households moved away. Poor peasant Zhu Dechang said: "In the past, I borrowed five *sheng* of rice from landlord Zhu Chengji and repaid one *dou* and five *sheng* after three years; the interest was cleared, but the principal remained. Last year, I was sick, and my work points were low, so the government supplied 700 *jin*. If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, I would have starved to death long ago."

　　Next, they used "three calculations" to debate whether the "three fix" policy (fixed production, fixed purchase, fixed sales) was reasonable. The "three calculations" were: first, calculating the overall grain accounts of the whole country, the whole province, and the whole county; second, calculating the annual increase in production; and third, calculating the grain income of the cooperative and its members last year. Last year, after deducting seeds, sideline production grain, public grain, and surplus grain sold, the actual grain distributed to members, converted into raw grain, totaled more than 2.66 million *jin*. The entire cooperative had 4,844 people, with an average actual gain of 549 *jin* of raw grain per person, and this did not include the 25,000 *jin* supplied by the state this spring. In the face of these specific accounts, the issue was self-evident.

　　Finally, they conducted "three evaluations" in conjunction with specific individuals: evaluating whether speculation and disruption of the market are good, or whether obeying unified purchase and sales is good; whether thrift is good, or whether wasting grain and reaching out to the state for help is good; whether actively going to work and earning more work points is good, or whether absenteeism and engaging in spontaneous activities is good.

　　Well-to-do middle peasant He Cunxin was dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sale of grain. He bought more than 400 *jin* of rice from the black market while saying, "Since the state manages the market, why doesn't the state take out grain to sell when there is no grain on the market?" Poor peasant Wu Jichang retorted: "Do you still remember the situation when grain was in the hands of landlords in the past? During the drought in the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), landlords bought up good fields for four or five hundred *jin* of rice per *mu*. Niu Zhaosheng's family was starving and had no choice but to sell one *mu* of land to the landlord for only six *sheng* of rice. This year, there was a drought in early spring. If the state had not controlled the grain and helped us with 25,000 *jin*, we would have had to sell at least half of the fields we were allocated during land reform." Poor peasant Lü Dequan added: "Besides, even if there is grain on the market, it is still bought by you rich people. If we lack grain and have no money, it's all for nothing."

　　Poor peasant Niu Guanfu believed that 380 *jin* of rations per person was too little and that at least four *jin* per person per day was enough. Poor peasant Niu Shaowen said, "You are like someone who has forgotten the pain once the sore has healed; your family has never eaten that much in the past." Poor peasant Niu Jialu also examined the specific situation in his own home and said, "If we don't waste it, there is enough grain."

　　After the great debate, everyone had a clearer understanding of the superiority of collectivization and the necessity of unified purchase and sales. As a result, enthusiasm for production has also increased. The attendance rate, which had once dropped to 40% during the "blooming and contending" period, has now risen to over 90%.

    经过三比、三算、三评
    曲靖社辩倒了种种谬论
    本报讯　云南曲靖联合社采取“三比、三算、三评”办法展开大辩论，树立了正气，推动了生产。
    该社在鸣放期间，对粮食问题提了不少意见。这些意见表面上多是针对口粮而发的，其实质却牵涉到是否要社会主义和合作社是否优越等问题，于是他们就先进行“三比”“比比究竟是资本主义好，是封建主义好，还是社会主义好。”在会上，社员们回忆了解放前的苛捐杂税，什么地租、耕地税、囚粮米、借购米还有什么国民党军要的“大包米”等等共达二十多种。农民过着非人的生活，光解放前的十余年中，就活活饿死的三十一人，逃荒死掉的三十一人，搬家逃难的二十三户。贫农朱德昌说：“过去我借地主朱成吉五升米，三年还了一斗五，利清本还在。去年害了病，工分少缺粮，政府就供应了七百斤，不是共产党领导，早饿死了。”
    接着，他们又通过“三算”来辩论三定政策是否合理。“三算”是：一算全国全省全县的粮食大账，二算每年的增产账，三算去年合作社和社员的粮食收入账。去年除籽种、副业用粮、缴公粮、卖余粮外，实际分到社员手中的粮食，折成原粮计二百六十六万多斤，全社四千八百四十四人，每人平均实得原粮五百四十九斤，而且今春国家供应的二万五千斤还不在内。在这些具体账目的前面，问题已是不辩自明了。
    最后，又结合具体的人进行了“三评”：评评究竟是投机倒把扰乱市场好，还是服从统购统销好；是勤俭治家好，还是浪费粮食伸手向国家要好；是积极出工多得工分好，还是旷工去搞自发好。
    富裕中农何存心对粮食统购统销不满，他一面从黑市上买了四百多斤米，一面还说“国家既然管理市场，市场上没有粮食国家为什么不拿出来卖？”贫农吴济昌反驳说：“你总记得过去粮食掌握在地主手里的情形吧？民国三十二年旱灾，一亩好田四五百斤米就被地主买了去。牛招生家饿得没法，只六升米就把一亩田卖给了地主。今年小春遭灾，如果不是国家掌握粮食，救济了我们二万五千斤，我们土改分的田至少得卖掉一半。”贫农吕德全补充说：“再说，市场上即使有粮食还不是你们有钱的人买，我们缺粮没有钱还不是白搭。”
    贫农牛关富认为每人三百八十斤口粮太少，至少每人每天四斤才够。贫农牛绍文说：“你这叫好了疮疤忘了痛，过去你一家人也没有吃过这么多。”贫农牛家禄还检查了自己家里的具体情形，说：“如果不浪费，粮食本来是够的。”
    经过大辩论以后，大家对合作化的优越性和统购统销的必要性都有了更加明确的认识。因而生产积极性也增加了。鸣放期间出勤率曾一度降到40％，现在已上升到90％以上了。
