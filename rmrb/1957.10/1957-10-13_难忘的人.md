　　Unforgettable Person
　　Zeng Zhao'an

　　In the laundry room, everyone was talking and laughing, chatting as they washed, truly discussing everything from the ends of the earth, enjoying themselves immensely. As for me, I had just arrived at the school, unfamiliar with everyone, and awkward, unable to join in any conversation. Just then, a person about forty years old came to the washing pool next to me, wearing a faded and worn-out Zhongshan suit that had long been bleached by the sun, with a high forehead. As soon as he put down his basin, he busily rolled up his sleeves, preparing to scrub, and smiled at me, asking kindly, "Comrade, which department are you in?"
　　"Chinese Department!" I answered readily.
　　"Just arrived?"
　　"Yes!..." Before I could say when I arrived, he continued to ask, "Judging by your accent, you're probably from Guangdong or Guangxi! Are you getting used to the life here? Any difficulties? What's your name?"
　　I thought this person was a bit strange, why would he ask such a string of questions on our first meeting? But looking at his round face, which showed kindness and sincerity everywhere, I felt a sense of warmth.
　　"Just settling in, so of course it's a bit unfamiliar and not quite accustomed, but after staying for a long time, it will be like home! That's how it was when I came here from the South," he said with a slight smile, looking out the window, talking to himself, when I mentioned feeling a bit disgusted by the sandstorms in Lanzhou, but otherwise alright.
　　Just as I was about to open my mouth to ask his name, what he did, when he came to Lanzhou, and so on, I heard such a burst of shouting: "Principal, when did you come back? Any news from Beijing?" I quickly turned my head to look around, to see what the principal looked like. Unexpectedly, he stopped scrubbing, turned to face everyone, and said with a smile, "I came back yesterday, how have you all been lately? Are you busy with your studies?"
　　Hearing this, I couldn't help but freeze, unsure of where to put my hands, thinking to myself, "Oh, so it's the principal! That was close..."
　　He chatted with everyone for a while, then went back to doing his work as usual, chatting with me kindly as before. But I was puzzled: "University principal, doesn't he have a lot of things to do? Why does he still do this work himself?" I heard that initially, when classmates saw him washing his own clothes, they felt the same way as me, strange and uncomfortable, so they raised an objection to his face. He said slowly, "Staying in the office all day will make your brain swell and become useless. Taking some time each day to do some light physical labor can both let the brain rest and exercise myself, isn't that killing two birds with one stone!"
　　He paid great attention to physical activity and strongly urged students not to neglect physical exercise. Therefore, during extracurricular activities, if he passed by the sports field and saw everyone playing ball intensely, while you were ignoring it, squatting on the side watching, he would definitely gesture to you, saying gently, "Come on, let's join in too!" If you still refused to move, he would reach out and pull you onto the field.
　　Once, he discovered that a new student's quilt was too thin, so he immediately asked the messenger to send his only tiger skin coat to that student. That night, the student returned and saw a fur coat on his bed, and hurriedly asked whose coat was left here? When his roommate told him, he was so moved that he burst into tears, saying to himself, "How did the principal know? He doesn't have many clothes himself, it doesn't matter if I get cold, but if he gets cold, the revolutionary cause will suffer a great loss!" Thinking this, he picked up the coat and ran quickly to the principal's room, returning it to him. The principal, of course, refused to take it, and asked the messenger to send it back, doing this three times. Finally, the principal came himself, patting the student's shoulder and saying, "You can cover yourself with it for a few days, and after the organization has studied it, they will subsidize you with some money to buy some cotton to add to your quilt, then you can return it to me!"
　　No matter what the occasion, as soon as he showed his face, before he could catch his breath, a crowd of students would immediately surround him, asking this and that, raising opinions... At this time, he would always answer every question with a smile, and the results would be immediate. Students would always say, "Go find the principal!" when they had any opinions. As for holidays and festivals, it was even more lively, like a big family of five generations. Early in the morning, students would go to wish him a Happy New Year in groups of three or five, shouting for pocket money like grandchildren asking for it, chanting in unison to eat candy and biscuits. And he? He also understood the students' psychology, having prepared New Year's refreshments in advance to welcome the students' visit.
　　Now, I have been away from this lovely revolutionary paradise for more than a year, and every time I recall the past, he is the first person who appears in my heart, like an early spring breeze, warming my heart. Especially recently, when right-wing elements are using every means to slander our Party, I cannot forget this old Party member who has participated in the revolution for more than twenty years, just as I cannot forget drinking water.

　　难忘的人
　　曾昭安
    洗衣房里，人人有说有笑，个个边洗边谈，真所谓海角天涯，无所不讲，乐和极了。我呢，刚到校不久，人生面不熟，嘴又笨，跟谁都搭不上腔。正在这当儿，身边的洗衣池就来了个年约四十多岁的人，身穿着早被太阳晒得褪了色、陈旧不堪的中山装，额头高高。他一撂下衣盆，就一边忙着卷袖筒，准备搓洗；一边微笑地朝着我，和蔼地问：“同志，在那系？”
    “中文系！”我顺口答着。
    “刚到？”
    “对！……”我还来不及说出何时到校，他又连续地问：“听口音，你大概是两广吧！生活过得惯吗？有啥困难？叫啥名字？”
    我一听，觉得这人有点怪，为什么初次交谈，就这样提出一连串问题？但瞧瞧他那副圆脸庞，处处都显露出亲切、诚恳的笑容，又觉得叫人亲切。
    “刚落户，当然有些陌生，不习惯，可呆的时间一长，就会像家乡啦！我从南方到这儿时，就是这样。”当我说出对兰州风砂有些恶感，别的还好的时候，他就微微一笑，瞧瞧窗外，自言自语地说。
    我刚想张口，问问他名字，干啥工作，何时到兰州等问题，耳边就听到这样哄然地叫嚷声：“校长，啥时回来？北京有啥新闻？”我忙回头四望，看看校长是个啥模样儿。没料他却停止搓洗，转身朝着大伙，笑嘻嘻地说：“昨天回来，你们近来可好？学习忙吗？”
    我一听，不禁呆了，双手不知搁在那儿才好，心儿暗想：“哟，原来是校长！好险呀……”
    他跟大伙寒喧了一阵，又照常干他活儿，照样和蔼地跟我闲聊。可我却在纳闷儿：“大学校长，事儿还少吗？为啥还自个干这活儿？”听说，最初同学见他自个洗衣，也跟我一样感到又奇怪又不顺眼，就当面给他提了个意见。他却慢吞吞地说：“整天呆办公室，脑子也会发涨，不管用。每天抽点时间，作些轻微的体力劳动，既能让脑子歇歇，又能锻炼自己，这不是两全其美！”
    他很注意身体活动，并力劝同学别忽视体育锻炼。所以，在课外活动时候，要是他路过球场，见大伙正紧张地玩球，而你却不理不睬，蹲在一边观望，他准向你打着手势，温和地说：“来，咱们也来吧！”如果还不肯动，他就会动手拉你下场。
    有一次，他发现了一个新同学被子太薄，便立刻叫通讯员将自个唯一仅有的虎皮大衣送去给那个同学。晚上，那同学回来，见床上搁着一件皮大衣，忙问谁的大衣丢在这儿？同房伙伴一说，他竟激动得掉下泪来，自言自语地说：“校长怎知道？他衣服也不多呀，冻坏我不打紧，要是冻坏他啊，革命事业遭受损失就大啦！”想着想着，便抱起大衣，飞快地往校长房里跑，送还给他。校长当然不肯，又叫通讯员送去，这样来回了三次。最后，校长就亲自送来了，拍着那同学肩膀说：“你暂盖几天，待组织研究好了，补助你些钱，买些棉絮添上，然后还我不迟！”
    无论在什么场合，他只要稍为一露头，气还没喘一喘，马上就有成堆堆的同学围着他，问这问那，提提意见……这时，他总是笑盈盈地回答每一个问题，并且不久马上见效。同学有什么意见，老这样说：“找校长去！”至于逢年过节，那就更热闹咯，简直像五代同堂的大家庭。一大清早，同学们就三五成群的去给他拜年，像子子孙孙们嚷着要压岁钱那样，异口同声地嚷着吃糖嚼饼。他呢？也懂得同学心理，事先早就预备好了过年茶点，迎接同学的光临。
    现在，我已经离开了这个可爱的革命乐园一年多了，每当我回忆既往，他就会首先出现在我的心间，像股早来的春风，吹暖了我的心。特别在最近右派分子用千方百计来中伤我党的时候，我更不能忘掉这位参加革命二十多年的老党员，正如我不能忘掉喝水一般。
