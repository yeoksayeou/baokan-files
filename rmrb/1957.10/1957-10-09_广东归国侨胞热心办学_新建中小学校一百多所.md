Xinhua News Agency Report: Returned overseas Chinese and their families in Guangdong Province, including Huiyang and Chao'an, are enthusiastically donating money to establish schools. This semester, they have newly established more than one hundred middle schools, primary schools, and secondary vocational schools. The Guangzhou Qiaoguang Middle School, initiated and prepared by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Zhi Gong Party, has received donations from overseas Chinese and compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao, and is preparing to build a school building near the beautiful Overseas Chinese New Village that can accommodate more than 1,000 students. The Dapeng Overseas Chinese Middle School, established by returned overseas Chinese and their families in Huiyang County, has been continuously supported by donations from Hong Kong compatriots and overseas Chinese living in Europe, the Americas, and other places.

In the process of preparing for the construction of schools, returned overseas Chinese and their families in various places have received strong assistance from local governments. Relevant departments have allocated a number of public houses or land plots to help them solve the problem of school buildings. The Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Department has also allocated a batch of subsidies to various counties to help those newly established Overseas Chinese tutoring classes with difficulties in solving the funding problems for this semester.

The establishment of these schools by overseas Chinese has played a significant role in solving the problem of enrollment for overseas Chinese students. The fifteen junior middle schools newly established in Taishan and Kaiping counties have enrolled approximately 2,500 students, of which about 70% are children of overseas Chinese. Together with the students admitted by public middle schools, the enrollment problem for most of the children of overseas Chinese has been solved.

    广东归国侨胞热心办学
    新建中小学校一百多所
    新华社讯　广东省惠阳、潮安等地归国侨胞、侨眷热心捐款办学，本学期新筹办的中学、小学和中等补习学校共一百多所。由致公党广东省委员会发起筹办的广州侨光中学，得到海外华侨和港澳同胞捐助，准备在风景幽美的华侨新村附近兴建一座能容一千多学生的校舍。惠阳县归侨、侨眷筹办的大鹏华侨中学，不断得到香港同胞和旅居欧洲、美洲等地的华侨捐款支持。
    各地归侨、侨眷在筹建学校的过程中，都得到当地政府的大力协助。有关部门拨出不少公房或地段，帮助他们解决校舍问题。广东省侨务部门还拨出了一批补助款，分配给各县，协助那些有困难的新办华侨补习班解决本学期的经费困难。
    华侨兴办这些学校，对解决侨生入学问题起了很大作用。台山、开平两县新办的十五所初级中学，共录取约二千五百名学生，其中百分之七十左右是华侨子弟，加上公立中学录取的部分，已解决了大部分华侨子弟的升学问题。
