Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Sichuan province has largely completed the transfer of an estimated 15.5 billion jin of grain during the first Five-Year Plan period. People in twenty-one provinces and municipalities, including Hebei and Anhui, have consumed Sichuan grain.

Sichuan province, which has enjoyed consecutive years of bumper harvests, has increased grain production by a total of 13 billion jin from 1953 to 1957. In 1956, Sichuan province transferred 600 million jin more grain than in 1955. By the end of September this year, the amount of grain transferred had already exceeded the total amount transferred throughout last year by 1.2 billion jin.

A road construction worker named Chen Shiping wrote from the Niangziguan railway construction site in Shanxi province, saying: "When we saw bags of rice labeled 'Sichuan Province,' we felt indescribably happy. The workers in our team all said that we must repay you with actions of overfulfilling our tasks." The Baoding Special District Production Relief Committee in Hebei Province also wrote to thank the Sichuan farmers on behalf of the local three million disaster victims.

The Huaizhua Agricultural Cooperative of Zaoxiang Township in Fengyang County, Anhui Province, a disaster area, used wheat seeds transported from Sichuan for planting. After a bountiful wheat harvest, the cooperative members wrote a letter to thank the Sichuan farmers for their support.

    四川五年调出粮食百多亿斤
    据新华社讯　四川省在第一个五年计划期间预计外调的一百五十五亿斤粮食已大部完成，河北、安徽等二十一个省、市的人民吃到了四川的粮食。
    连年丰收的四川省，自1953年到1957年共增产粮食一百三十亿斤。1956年四川省外调的粮食比1955年多六亿斤，今年到9月底为止，已经外调的粮食又比去年全年外调的多十二亿斤。
    一个叫陈世平的筑路工人从山西省娘子关铁路工地写信说：当我们看到一袋袋写着“四川省”字样的大米的时候，心里真有说不出的高兴。我们队上的工人同志们都说，我们一定以超额完成任务的行动来报答你们。河北省保定专区生产救灾委员会，代表当地三百万灾民也给四川农民写信致谢。
    安徽省灾区凤阳县枣巷乡淮花农业社曾用四川省运去的麦种播种，社员们在小麦丰收之后写信感谢四川农民的支援。
