    Two to Zero
    August 1st Team Defeats Japanese Football Team
    (Our dispatch) The Japanese National Football Team, which has been invited to visit our country, played its first match in China on the afternoon of the 20th against China's "August 1st" Football Team. The "August 1st" team won with a score of two to zero.
    Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long watched the match, and after the game, they met with both teams and took pictures together.
    After the kickoff, the visiting team adopted a dense defensive tactic. Therefore, although the home team launched a fierce attack, repeatedly approaching the visiting team's goal, the ball was either kicked out of bounds by the visiting team or blocked back. At the same time, the visiting team's center forward and two wingers frequently appeared in the opponent's territory, in order to contain the opponent's offensive power. The first half ended with a score of zero to zero.
    In the second half, the "August 1st" team changed its tactics from the first half, adopting a strategy of spreading out the two wings and feinting to the east while attacking in the west, which significantly changed the situation. When the game reached the twenty-second minute, Pan Peigen, the right winger of the "August 1st" team, received a ball from the rear, dribbled straight to the baseline, baited out the opponent's defender, and suddenly lightly lobbed the ball to the center. Right inside forward Xing Guifu rushed up and headed the ball skillfully to the left side. Left winger Cui Hengxie rushed up and kicked the ball into the net before goalkeeper Yoshio Furukawa could react. One to zero, the "August 1st" team scored the first goal.
    The "August 1st" team launched another attack along the same route. Right inside forward Xing Guifu received the ball and passed it to right winger Pan Peigen. Pan Peigen, with his sharp eyes and quick feet, kicked the ball to the center again. Left inside forward Xian Dixiong rushed up and volleyed the ball into the net, ending the game with a score of two to zero.

    二比零
    八一队胜日足球队
    本报讯  应邀来我国访问的日本国家足球队，20日下午与我国“八一”足球队，进行了来我国后的第一场比赛。“八一”队以二比零获胜。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理观看了这场比赛，在球赛结束后接见了双方队员，并在一起照了像。
    开球后，客队采取密集防守战术，因此主队虽然进行猛攻猛打，几度迫近客队门前，但不是被客队将球踢出界外，就是将球挡了回去。同时客队的中锋和两个边锋时常出没于对方腹地，借以牵制对方的进攻力量。上半场以零比零结束。
    下半场，“八一”队一改上半场的打法，采取拉开两翼、声东击西的办法，局势有显著改变。比赛进行到第二十二分钟时，“八一”队右翼潘培根得到后方来球，带球直捣底线，诱出对方后卫，突然将球轻吊中路。右内锋邢桂福赶上用头一顶，球巧妙地传到了左边，左翼崔亨燮疾步赶到，飞起一脚，守门员古川好男还来不及抢救，球已经飞入网底了，一比零，“八一”队先得一球。
    “八一”队又在上次的路线上发动了进攻。右内锋邢桂福得球后，递给右翼潘培根，潘培根眼明脚快，又将球踢到中路，左内锋冼迪雄赶上来个落地开花，球又飞向网底，以二比零结束。
