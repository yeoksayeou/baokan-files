In the midst of forests, in the midst of fields, undulating, winding, sometimes visible, sometimes hidden, this is a road stretching into the clouds, its sides inlaid with borders as green as jade.
Road, you are like the ribbons of a celestial dancer, twirling in the sky with her dance. When she passionately throws herself into our human world, you lightly float over valleys and mountains.
Although this is an endless series of ups and downs, you are so smooth for travelers. No matter how many vehicles travel along you each day, you let them pass safely through the clouds.
I have crossed many dangerous terrains in my life, but none compare to your seventy-two bends. It guards the gateway to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, welcoming those who come from afar into the deep mountains.
Diao Si Cliff used to be like a wild dragon, often overturning passing vehicles at will. Now, it is motionless and subdued, clinging to the cliff, panting and sweating coldly.
Sitting in the car, I look at the scenery outside the window. The peaks, villages, forests, all look like paintings. The car flying up and down does not affect my interest because, road, I feel safe because of you.

    To the Road Maintenance Workers

One moment standing above the clouds, the next standing below the clouds, using the small stones you have crushed on weekdays to pave the road, scattering sand and mud on it, repairing the roadside.
Home is this road, this road is home, and most importantly, it is the blood vessel of the motherland.
Thinking of it, the roar of tigers and the cries of apes turn into music. Your love for it will never be broken.
Torrential rain cannot damage it in the slightest. After the rain, more beautiful mountains and rivers accompany it.
Sudden mountain floods want to冲击 it, but they cannot move it and can only flash past.
On snowy days, silver flowers in pieces, crystal串串, you are like brave soldiers resisting the severe cold. Sometimes, waking up from a dream in the middle of the night, you put on your clothes, light the lamp, and come out to check.

    To the Double-Shift Drivers

It is to transport the blood of the motherland, it is to make the cities on the plateau prosperous, it is to make the villages and mountain settlements increasingly wealthy, it is to make the rhythm of life more distinct…
Hurry on, hurry on, climb mountains, cross ridges, your cars are racing one after another, like mist, like smoky clouds of dust, rising from the road and rolling all the way to the sky.
A pair of greasy hands tightly grips the steering wheel, a serious face shining with dark brown eyes. How much pride and thought burns in the pupils, and those red numbers are the best explanation.
100,000 kilometers, 200,000 kilometers, 250,000 kilometers, this is the safe distance you have already traveled. Whenever you arrive at the last station, covered in dust, a comrade-style greeting will make you feel relaxed all over.
Hurry on, hurry on, climb mountains, cross ridges, the headlights are like swords, cutting through the night and dark clouds, even on rainy, snowy nights, you still hurry on, until dawn.

    Silkworm Farmers

On the top of Golden Peak Mountain grow mulberry trees and oak trees, and at the foot of Golden Peak Mountain live silkworm farmers.
The cocoons are as if formed of gold fruits and silver fruits, and in the hearts of the silkworm farmers bloom golden flowers and silver flowers.
Gold fruits and silver fruits fill thousands of baskets and ten thousands of baskets, sending them to silk factories to weave into brocade and silk.
Golden flowers and silver flowers bloom all over the foot of Golden Peak Mountain, and those beyond the mountain and overseas thank the silkworm farmers.

    西南行吟
    放平在树林中间，在田野中间，起伏着，蜿蜒着，时隐时现，这是一条伸向云层的大路，两侧镶着绿如碧玉的花边。路呵，你像飞天身上的飘带，随着她的舞姿在天空中旋转，当她热烈地投身在我们人寰，你就轻盈地飘过河谷和高山。虽然这里是无尽止的上上下下，对于行旅，你却是这样的平坦，每天无论有多少车辆沿着你前进，你都让它们安安稳稳地穿过云端。我这一生曾经越过许多天险，没有一处比得上你七十二弯，是它把守着云贵高原的大门，迎接远道而来的人进入深山。吊死崖曾经像一头撒野的凶龙，常把来来往往的车辆任意掀翻。如今，它一动也不动地驯服了，贴在悬崖上喘息着，流着冷汗。我坐在车上，看着窗外的山色，峰峦，村落，树林，都像画面，汽车飞上飞下并不影响我的兴致，路呵，因为有你保证我的安全。
        致养路工一忽儿站在云彩上面，一忽儿站在云彩下面，用平日捶碎的小石子铺在路上，为它撒着泥沙，为它修整路边。家就是这条路，这条路就是家，最最重要的，它是祖国的血管。想起它，虎啸猿啼化成了音乐，你们对它的爱情呵，永不折断。滂沱的大雨不能损伤它分毫，雨后有那更明媚的山川陪伴；突然袭来的山洪想向它冲击，可是碰不动，只好闪过一边。下雪天，银花片片，水晶串串，你们就像勇敢的战士抗住严寒，有时候深夜里从睡梦中醒来，也披上衣，点上灯，出来查看。
      致双班车是为了把祖国的血液输送，是为了使高原上的城市繁荣，是为了村镇和山寨日渐富裕，是为了生活的节奏更加鲜明……赶路呵赶路，爬山呵越岭，你们的车一辆接着一辆飞奔，像雾，也像烟云般的尘土，从路面升起，一直卷向天空。一双油垢的手紧紧握着方向盘，严肃的脸上亮着棕黑色的眼睛，有多少骄傲和思虑在瞳孔里燃炽，那些红色的数字就是最好的说明。十万公里，二十万公里，二十五万公
  里，这是你们已经安全走过的行程，每当风尘仆仆开进最后一个车站，一句同志式的慰问会使全身轻松。赶路呵赶路，爬山呵越岭，车灯像宝剑，划破夜幕和黑云，即或是在风雨和冰雪的晚上，你们也照样的赶路，直到天明。
      养蚕人家金顶山上长着桑树柞树，金顶山下住着养蚕人家。蚕茧结得好像金果银果，蚕农心里开着金花银花。金果银果装满千箩万箩，送到丝厂织成锦绣绫罗。金花银花开遍金顶山下，山外海外感谢养蚕人家。
