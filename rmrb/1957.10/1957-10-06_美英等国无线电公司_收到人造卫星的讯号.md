Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Following the successful launch of the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite, radio companies in the United States, Britain, and other countries have received signals transmitted from the satellite.

    The Telecommunications Department of the Radio Corporation of America in New York City first received the signal from the artificial satellite at 0:07 Greenwich Mean Time on the 5th. This signal continued for 23 minutes before disappearing. The sound of the signal was 0.3 seconds long, with intervals of the same duration.

    On the 5th, after receiving the signal of the artificial satellite recorded by the US Arcie Radio Company, the National Broadcasting Company of the United States immediately stopped its regular broadcasting program and broadcast the "beep," "beep" sound of the artificial satellite. The Columbia Broadcasting System of the United States also broadcast this signal.

    The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) headquarters announced at 0:50 Greenwich Mean Time on the 5th that its listening station in Kent had received the signal from the artificial satellite in accordance with the wavelength announced by the Soviet Union. An engineer from the broadcasting company said that they first heard huge atmospheric interference sounds at frequencies of 20,005 and 40,002 megahertz, and then heard intermittent sounds occurring every 0.3 seconds, as reported by Moscow Radio in the Soviet Union. The pitch of the sound varied slightly, and the signal gradually disappeared as the artificial satellite moved away from the radio's antenna.

    The Reuters radio station near London in the United Kingdom also received the signal from the artificial satellite. They said that this signal was somewhat like a "long dash" in Morse code.

    The Lisbon Post Office radio station in Portugal also listened to the signal from the artificial satellite on the 5th.

    美英等国无线电公司
    收到人造卫星的讯号
    新华社5日讯　苏联的世界上第一颗人造卫星发射成功后，美英等国无线电公司都已经收到了这颗人造卫星上发出来的讯号。
    纽约市的美国无线电公司的电讯部在5日格林威治时间零点七分钟第一次收到了人造卫星的讯号，这种讯号一直延续了二十三分钟才消失。这种讯号的声音长零点三秒，有同样时间的间歇。
    美国全国广播公司5日收到了美国亚尔西埃无线电公司记录下来的这颗人造卫星的讯号后，立刻停止了它的正常广播节目，把人造卫星的讯号“噼”、“噼”的声音广播出去。美国哥伦比亚广播公司也广播了这种讯号。
    英国广播公司总公司在5日格林威治时间零时五十分钟宣布，它设在肯特郡的收听站按照苏联公布的波长，收到了人造卫星的讯号。这个广播公司的一个工程师说，他们首先在二万零五和四万零二兆赫的频率上听到了巨大的天电干扰声，接着就听到了正如苏联莫斯科电台所说的每隔零点三秒钟发生一次的断续的声音。声音的音调有点变化，当人造卫星远离电台的天线时，讯号就逐渐消失了。
    英国路透社在伦敦附近的无线电台也收到了人造卫星的讯号。他们说，这种讯号有些像莫尔斯电码中的“长划”。
    葡萄牙里斯本的邮政局无线电台5日也收听到了人造卫星的讯号。
