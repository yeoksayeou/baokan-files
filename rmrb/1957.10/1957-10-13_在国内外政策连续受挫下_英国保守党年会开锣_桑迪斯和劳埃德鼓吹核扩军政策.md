Xinhua News Agency, October 12th, Brighton dispatch: The British Conservative Party annual meeting opened on October 10th in Brighton, England.

Due to the difficulties the Conservative government's nuclear armament program has caused the British economy, defense policy and economic policy will be the central issues to be discussed at the annual meeting. Reports indicate that the meeting will also discuss the Soviet Union's successful launch of an artificial satellite.

At the same time, a series of setbacks suffered by the Conservative government in other aspects of domestic and foreign policy, particularly the failure of the invasion of Egypt, have also led to a growing decline in the Conservative government's prestige at home. How to reverse the Conservative Party's political decline to cope with the next general election will be a question for Conservative politicians to consider at the annual meeting.

In his report, Defense Minister Sandys attempted to soothe the strong unease and dissatisfaction with the government's nuclear armament policy among the British people caused by the news of the Soviet Union's testing of intercontinental ballistic missiles and the successful launch of artificial satellites. At the same time, he advocated continuing to implement the nuclear arms expansion program. Sandys said, "There is no weapon for which a countermeasure cannot be found," but he had to admit, "It is no use thinking that such a method can be found quickly."

He said that fighter planes, no matter how effective, are clearly unable to resist ballistic rockets. "In such a century of intercontinental rockets, nuclear submarines, and artificial moons," it is necessary to aim for complete peace and achieve "genuine and comprehensive disarmament." However, Sandys also said that Britain has already stockpiled a "moderate amount" of atomic weapons and will "continue to research and produce hydrogen bombs and the rockets to carry them."

The annual meeting passed a proposal expressing "complete confidence" in the government's nuclear weapons policy.

The Conservative Party annual meeting discussed foreign policy and Britain's participation in the European Free Trade Area on October 11th.

During the discussion of foreign policy, Pearson called on the British government to strengthen its independent activities and not rely on the United States. Foreign Secretary Lloyd's speech was full of attacks on the Soviet Union and anti-Soviet clichés. He tried to use such fallacies as "Communist infiltration" to make people believe that the Soviet Union was interfering in the internal affairs of the Near and Middle Eastern countries. He also promoted military blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, especially promoting atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, saying that these were "deterrents" against the "threat of Communist aggression." Lloyd opposed making Britain a third force playing a role in balancing the policies of the United States and the Soviet Union, saying that it was a "dangerous idea."

A proposal passed by the annual meeting stated that the meeting fully supports the principles of the United Nations, but in handling foreign affairs, the vital interests of Britain must always be taken into account first.

The annual meeting passed a resolution in favor of participating in the free trade area and supported the government's guarantees regarding not including agricultural products and maintaining Commonwealth ties.

### 在国内外政策连续受挫下  英国保守党年会开锣  桑迪斯和劳埃德鼓吹核扩军政策

    在国内外政策连续受挫下
    英国保守党年会开锣
    桑迪斯和劳埃德鼓吹核扩军政策
    据新华社12日讯　布莱顿消息：英国保守党年会10月10日在英格兰的布莱顿开幕。
    由于保守党政府的核军备计划给英国经济造成的困难，国防政策和经济政策将是年会要讨论的中心问题。消息说，会议还要讨论苏联发射人造卫星成功的问题。
    同时，保守党政府在国内外政策其他方面遭到的一连串挫折，特别是侵略埃及战争的失败，也使保守党政府在国内的威信日益下降。如何挽救保守党政治上的颓势以应付下届大选，将是保守党政客们在年会上要考虑的问题。
    国防大臣桑迪斯在他的报告里一方面企图抚慰苏联试验洲际弹道导弹和发射人造卫星成功的消息在英国人心中引起的对政府核军备政策的强烈不安和不满，一方面又鼓吹要继续执行核扩军计划。桑迪斯说，“没有找不到对付办法的武器”，但是，他又不得不承认，“以为很快就能找到这种办法是没有好处的”。
    他说，战斗机不管效能如何，显然是不能抵御弹道火箭的。“在这样一个洲际火箭、核潜艇和人造月亮的世纪中”，必须以全面和平为目标，实现“真正的、全面的裁军”。但是，桑迪斯又说，英国已经储存了“数量适度”的原子武器，并且将“继续研究和生产氢弹和载运它们的火箭”。
    年会通过了对政府的核武器政策表示“完全信任”的提案。
    保守党年会11日讨论了外交政策和英国参加欧洲自由贸易区问题。
    在讨论外交政策问题时，柏逊呼吁英国政府加强独立活动，不要依赖美国。外交大臣劳埃德的发言充满了对苏联的攻击和反苏滥调。他力图用“共产主义渗入”等等谰言来使人相信苏联在干涉中近东国家的内政。他还宣扬北大西洋集团、巴格达条约、东南亚条约等军事集团，特别是宣扬原子弹和氢弹，说这是对付“共产主义侵略威胁”的“威慑因素”。劳埃德反对使英国成为在均衡美国同苏联的政策方面发挥作用的第三种力量，他说那是一种“危险的想法”。
    年会通过的一项提案说，会议完全支持联合国的原则，可是在处理外交事务的时候必须永远首先考虑到英国的切身利益。
    年会通过决议赞成参加自由贸易区，并且支持政府关于不把农产品包括在内和保持英联邦联系的保证。
