Xinhua News Agency, 30th September: Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel this evening to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

More than 1,800 foreign guests from over fifty countries, as well as diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries in China, were invited to attend.

At the beginning of the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai invited Premier Kadar, Chairman Yugov, former Indonesian Vice President Dr. Hatta and his wife, the head of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation Aristov, the head of the Czechoslovak National Assembly delegation Chairman Fierlinger and his wife, the head of the Yugoslav National Assembly delegation Chairman Stambolic, the head of the Burmese Friendship Delegation U Min Thein, and Princess Norodom Phurissara and Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia to the rostrum. At this moment, warm applause rang out in the hall for a long time.

On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, Premier Zhou Enlai extended the warmest welcome and gratitude to the guests from various countries. He said: The fact that guests from many countries are celebrating our National Day with us vividly illustrates that the Chinese people have friends all over the world. This is a very powerful answer to the recent exclusion of New China from the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his respect for the heroic people of Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries. He pointed out that their heroic struggles not only safeguard their national independence but also make significant contributions to the cause of world peace.

Finally, Premier Zhou Enlai proposed a toast to the health of friends from all countries, to the peaceful coexistence and friendly exchanges of people from all countries, to the great unity of the people of the world, and to lasting world peace. (The full text of the speech is published on the second page.)

After stepping down from the rostrum, Premier Zhou Enlai first toasted peace and friendship with the distinguished guests from government delegations and parliamentary delegations from various countries. When toasting with the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation, the Premier said to them in Russian: "Long live Sino-Soviet solidarity!"

When Premier Zhou toasted with representatives from India's women, youth, and trade unions, he again said to them: "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai!" He also warmly shook hands and extended greetings to several former members of the Indian Medical Aid Team to China who had served in Yan'an during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Among this group of Indian guests was a young boy, the son of an Indian doctor who had sacrificed himself in Yan'an and his Chinese wife. Premier Zhou said to him, "You are the representative of the saying 'The Chinese and Indian people are brothers.'"

Premier Zhou Enlai toasted the entire staff of the Syrian journalist delegation, the Syrian student delegation, and the Egyptian youth delegation, expressing his respect for their heroic struggle against colonialism and congratulating them on their victory. Premier Zhou also specially asked President Nasser's brother to convey his regards to President Nasser and wished President Nasser good health.

Premier Zhou Enlai successively met with the delegation of the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, the Japanese Goodwill Delegation to China, figures from the Socialist Party, and delegations from trade unions, trade, Buddhism, and women's groups, and congratulated them on the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. Representatives from the Japan-China Friendship Association and Japanese youth representatives also formed a circle, clapping and singing "Tokyo-Beijing" to pay their respects to Premier Zhou. A representative from the Ibaraki Prefecture Delegation to China said enthusiastically, "Our Japanese people all hope to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations as soon as possible." Premier Zhou replied, "I also hope so," and warm applause broke out in the crowd.

When Italian Senator Drazini, a member of the Italian Goodwill Delegation to China, clinked glasses with Premier Zhou, he paid tribute to the Premier and the Chinese people on behalf of the majority of the Italian people. Premier Zhou replied that he accepted your tribute on behalf of the Chinese people, and the entire Chinese people are willing to be friends with the Italian people.

Premier Zhou also toasted the youth representatives and artists from Britain and the United States, exchanging greetings and toasting to peace and friendship. Premier Zhou Enlai came to the midst of people from the literary and art circles of various countries and met with actors from art troupes from the Soviet Union, Indonesia, Vietnam, Hungary, Colombia, and other countries. The crowd cheered "Long live peace" and "Friendship." Colombian artist Zapata said to the Premier that the Chinese people's warm welcome to us is unforgettable for the rest of our lives.

Premier Zhou Enlai wished the head of the Ballet Troupe of the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Soviet Union, Bugachov, and the deputy head, Zelifanov, a successful performance! Then he took a photo with the Colombian artists.

Friends from more than fifty countries gathered together to chat and laugh happily, and representatives from all walks of life in China continuously toasted the guests. Songs and laughter rose and fell one after another. Marshal Peng Dehuai met with the Egyptian Youth Delegation, the Syrian Student Delegation, and the Lebanese Peace Delegation at the reception and had a long and cordial conversation. Peng Dehuai said to them, the people of your three countries stand on the front line of the anti-colonialist struggle. I believe that all the Arab people will achieve final victory in the struggle, just like the Egyptian people. Marshal Peng Dehuai also specially asked the member of the Egyptian delegation, President Nasser's brother, to convey his respect to President Nasser. He said that the Chinese people and I are full of infinite respect for President Nasser's resoluteness and courage in the struggle against imperialism. President Nasser is one of the people I admire most. The head of the Lebanese Peace Delegation, George Hanna, said to Marshal Peng Dehuai that as long as the Chinese people and generals like you, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, stand with us, we will have the confidence to win. A member of the Syrian delegation said to Marshal Peng Dehuai that the people of all Arab countries have united and will achieve final victory in the struggle against imperialism together with the peace-loving people of the world.

Vice Premier He Long talked with young people from the United States and Latin America, and the young people introduced him to the lives and struggles of young people in the United States and Latin America. A Mexican youth said that the Mexican people's revolutionary movement and the Chinese revolution have many similarities. An American young woman said that the American people are very eager to understand every country in the world. She said that she was very interested in this trip to China because it gave her a lot of knowledge. After she goes back, she will tell the American people what she has seen and heard in China.

The members of the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation to China and Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, who had visited Japan, repeatedly shouted "Long live China-Japan friendship" and "Long live peace" in Chinese at the reception. The female actors of the Vietnamese National Art Troupe and the male actors of the Indonesian Maluku Art Troupe sang "Coconut Island Song" together; over there, the Japanese and Indonesian youth representatives sang "Young People" and "Independence Song" with great interest.

The reception lasted for two hours in a joyful and friendly atmosphere. The attendees included Vice Premiers Chen Yun, Peng Dehuai, Deng Xiaoping, He Long, Chen Yi, Ulanhu, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Bo Yibo, Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Marshal Ye Jianying, Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Burhan, as well as representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and all sectors of society.
