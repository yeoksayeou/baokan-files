Dr. Hatta's Speech at the Banquet of the Indonesian Ambassador to China

Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Tonight, the banquet hosted by the Indonesian Ambassador, Mr. Sukardjo Wirjopranoto, and his wife is, for all of us in the delegation, a farewell banquet to the leaders of the Central Government of the People's Republic of China, a farewell to Beijing.

This does not mean that we are leaving China immediately. Tomorrow morning, we will depart for Xinjiang, and from there, we will continue our visit southward. We have another ten days to visit and observe in the People's Republic of China.

Everything we have seen and experienced in these eleven days has surprised and delighted us greatly. We are surprised to see the people working diligently everywhere for construction. New factories are emerging in various places, factories that did not exist in the past, and which the old regime never even dreamed of. Some factories have grown from repair shops into modern factories, while others are newly built and fully modernized, such as automobile factories, steel plants, and jet aircraft manufacturing plants. In the field of jet aircraft manufacturing, China has surpassed some Western countries that are considered advanced.

What surprises me is that these factories mentioned above were built in a very short period. In the initial stages of construction, China did receive technical and other assistance from the Soviet Union. However, in a very short time, China possessed its own experts and management talents. All of this has been made possible because the government of the People's Republic of China has a strong desire, and because the youth and workers themselves have the enthusiasm for labor. The worker welfare programs organized by the government also surprised us, greatly strengthening the enthusiasm for labor. Democracy is practiced within enterprises, giving workers the opportunity to criticize leaders. I also belong to those who advocate this system. Because through these practices, workers can train themselves, make themselves responsible for the development of the enterprise, and thus also for the destiny of the entire nation.

While feeling surprised, we are also delighted by the scenes we have seen and experienced. I am delighted by the prestige and achievements enjoyed by the People's Republic of China.

Secondly, wherever we go, we are surrounded by an atmosphere of friendship, which also makes me happy. The warm and loving hospitality we have received everywhere has deeply moved us. The more cities and villages I visit, the more friends I gain in this country. I have received the friendship from the highest figures to the ordinary people—workers in factories and farmers in the countryside. My eleven days of experience in China, staying in Beijing and visiting the Northeast, tell me that I am truly in a friendly country.

I am convinced that the personal friendship that exists between leaders and responsible persons of various countries plays a significant role in the friendly relations between nations.

As I said last time, there is a long-standing, generations-old friendly relationship between the Indonesian and Chinese peoples, and the common fate we two nations suffered under colonial and imperial rule has further strengthened our mutual sympathy.

The Indonesian people love Dr. Sun Yat-sen and regard him as their leader. Was it not Dr. Sun Yat-sen who first proposed the slogan "Asia for Asians"? The Xinhai Revolution he launched had a significant impact on the growth of mass movements and revolutionary ideas in Indonesia. Precisely because of the Xinhai Revolution that took place in China in 1911, a mass movement emerged in Indonesia, the Islamic Union led by Tjokroaminoto. Subsequently, in 1913, there emerged the movement of the East Indies Party led by three leaders, Douwes Dekker, Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo, and Suwardi Suryaningrat, which openly demanded Indonesia's separation from Dutch rule.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposals also influenced the Anti-Colonialism League Conference held in Brussels in 1927. It was at this conference that I directly met several Chinese revolutionary leaders.

If there was friendship and individual contact between the Indonesian and Chinese peoples in the past, then since our two countries have gotten rid of the shackles of colonial rule and imperialism and achieved full sovereignty, the relationship between our two countries has become closer and more intimate.

Upon achieving independence, our two countries immediately established diplomatic relations. This moment brings back pleasant memories: in 1950, when Zhou Enlai and I held the same positions, namely Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, we both took steps to establish diplomatic relations.

The Ten Principles unanimously adopted at the Bandung Asian-African Conference in 1955 strengthened this friendly relationship. Despite the differences of opinion that existed at the conference, all participants were unwavering in their commitment to the two principles of opposing colonialism and defending world peace.

In addition, Indonesia and China both advocate peaceful coexistence. These three principles, coupled with other factors, have laid a solid foundation for enhancing the friendly relations between our two countries. China and Indonesia share the same history and have suffered the same fate in the past, which places upon our two countries the common task of maintaining lasting peace and seeking social justice for all mankind.

My visit to China has strengthened my conviction that the People's Republic of China genuinely holds the above aspirations.

Now, at this farewell banquet, I—and also on behalf of my wife and all members of the delegation—express our deep gratitude to the government of the People's Republic of China, especially Premier Zhou Enlai, for inviting us to visit various places in China. This visit has given us the opportunity to broaden our horizons and increase our knowledge. At the same time, we also express our thanks with the same feeling to the leaders and people of the various places we have visited. The overflowing friendship they showed in entertaining us is unforgettable.

In addition, I am extremely pleased to be able to participate in the celebration of the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China during this visit. I was amazed by the orderly and mass-participation grand celebration parade. I was fortunate to see this celebration parade, which is a perfect combination of education, discipline, organization, and culture, inspired by the teachings and inspiration of Chairman Mao Zedong.

Finally, I ask everyone to raise their glasses:

For the health of Chairman Mao Zedong and the prosperity of the Chinese people;

For the health of Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai;

For the friendship between China and Indonesia;

For the friendship between all nations and the realization of lasting world peace!

### 在印度尼西亚驻华大使的宴会上  哈达博士的讲话

    在印度尼西亚驻华大使的宴会上
    哈达博士的讲话尊敬的周恩来总理阁下，女士们，先生们：
    今晚印度尼西亚大使苏卡尔佐·维约普拉诺托先生和夫人举行的这个宴会，对我们代表团全体人员来说，也就是向中华人民共和国中央政府的首长们、向北京告别的宴会。
    这不等于说，我们就要离开中国了，明天早上我们将动身前往新疆，然后由那里继续往南方进行访问。我们还有十天时间在中华人民共和国参观和访问。
    十一天来，我们所看到的和经历的一切，都使我们感到非常惊讶和非常高兴。我们惊讶的是，我们到处都看到了人民为了建设而努力地劳动。新的工厂在各地涌现了，这些是过去所没有的，而且也是旧政权连想都没有想到过的。有些工厂是由修配厂发展成为现代化的工厂，有些则是新建的全部现代化的工厂，例如：汽车厂、钢铁厂和喷气式飞机制造厂。在制造喷气式飞机方面，中国也已超过了被视为先进的某些西方国家。
    使我惊讶的是，上述这些工厂都是在极短期间内建成的。在建设初期，中国的确是得到了苏联的技术人员和其它方面的援助，但是在很短的时期内，中国便拥有了自己的专家和管理人才。这一切之所以成为可能，是由于中华人民共和国政府有着坚强的愿望，是由于青年和工人本身具有着劳动的热情。政府举办的工人福利事业也使我们感到惊讶，它大大地加强了劳动的热情。企业内部是实行民主的，它给予工人以机会对领导人员进行批评。我也是属于坚持这种制度的人。因为通过上述做法，工人可以锻炼自己，使自己对企业的发展负起一分责任，从而也对整个民族的命运负起一分责任。
    在感到惊讶的同时，我们也从看到的和经历过的景况中感到高兴。我为中华人民共和国所享有的威望和取得的成就感到高兴。
    其次，不论到什么地方，我们都为友情的气氛所笼罩着，这也使我感到高兴。我们在各地所受到的那种洋溢着友爱的热情的款待使我们非常感动。我访问的城市和农村越多，我就在这个国家中获得了更多的朋友。我领受了从最高的人物以至普通的人民——工厂里的工人和农村中的农民——的友情。我在中国逗留在北京和访问东北的十一天的经历告诉了我，我是真正地置身在友好的国家里。
    我深信，存在于各国领导人和负责人之间的个人友情，对民族间的友好关系是起了莫大的作用。
    正如我上回说过的，印度尼西亚民族和中华民族之间有着悠久的世世代代的友好关系，而我们两个民族过去在殖民主义和帝国主义统治下所遭受到的共同的命运，更加强了我们彼此间的同情。
    印度尼西亚人民热爱着孙逸仙博士，并且把他当作自己的领袖看待。第一个提出“亚细亚人的亚细亚”的口号不正是孙逸仙博士吗？他所发动的辛亥革命，对印度尼西亚群众运动和革命思想的成长有着不小的影响。正由于1911年在中国所发生的辛亥革命，印度尼西亚也出现了一个群众运动，出现了由佐哥罗阿米诺托领导的伊斯兰教联盟。接着，1913年又出现了由道韦斯·德克尔、吉普多·曼贡库苏莫和苏阿迪·苏里亚宁格拉特莱三位领袖所领导的东印度党的运动，它公开地要求印度尼西亚脱离荷兰的统治。
    孙逸仙博士的主张对1927年在布鲁塞尔成立的反殖民主义同盟大会也起了影响。就在这个大会上我直接地认识了几个中国的革命领袖。
    如果说，过去在印度尼西亚人民和中国人民之间就存在着友情，就有着个别的接触的话，那末自从我们两国摆脱了殖民统治和帝国主义的桎梏并取得了完整的主权之后，我们两国的关系就益加接近和密切起来了。
    在取得独立的同时，我们两个国家就马上建立了外交关系。当前这个时刻引起了我的愉快的回忆：就在1950年当周恩来兄弟和我担任着同样的职务，即总理兼外交部长的时候，我们两人采取了建立外交关系的步骤。
    1955年在万隆亚非会议上最后一致通过的十项决议加强了这种友好关系。尽管当时会议上存在着意见的分歧，但是在反对殖民主义和保卫世界和平这两个原则方面，所有的与会者都毫不动摇。
    此外，印度尼西亚和中国都主张和平共处，由于这三个原则，加上其他的因素，就为增进我们两国友好关系奠定了巩固的基础。中国和印度尼西亚两国有着同样的历史，并在过去遭受到同样的命运，这使我们两国肩负起共同的任务，即维护持久和平并为全人类谋求社会正义。
    我这次访问中国，增强了我的信念：中华人民共和国确实抱着上述愿望。
    现在，在这个告别的宴会上，我——并且也代表我的夫人和全体团员——向邀请我们访问中国各地的中华人民共和国政府，特别是周恩来总理，表示深切的感谢。这次访问使我们有机会大开眼界和增加知识。同时，我们也以同样的心情对我们访问过的各地方的首长和人民表示谢意。他们在款待我们时所表现出来的那种洋溢的友情，使我们难以忘怀。
    另外，在这次访问中，我能够参加中华人民共和国建国八周年纪念感到异常高兴。我为这秩序井然的群众性的盛大庆祝游行感到惊讶。我有幸地看到了这个庆祝游行，它是教育、纪律、组织和文化的完善的结合体，是在毛泽东主席的教导和感召下激发起来的。
    最后，我请大家举杯：
    为毛泽东主席的健康和中国人民的繁荣；
    为朱德副主席和周恩来总理的健康；
    为中国和印度尼西亚的友谊；
    为各民族之间的友谊和世界持久和平的实现而干杯！
