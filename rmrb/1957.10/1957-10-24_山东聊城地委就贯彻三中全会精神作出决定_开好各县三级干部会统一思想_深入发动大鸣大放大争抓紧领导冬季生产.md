    According to the Dazhong Daily, the Liaocheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shandong Province held an enlarged meeting from October 10th to 17th to convey the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, decided to continue to deepen the socialist education movement in rural areas, carry out rectification and consolidation of communes, and decided to launch a large-scale winter production upsurge.
    After socialist education and mass debates in the rural areas of Liaocheng Prefecture, the socialist consciousness of cadres, party members, and peasants has been greatly improved, the capitalist ideas of well-to-do middle peasants have been severely criticized, the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements have been attacked, and the broad masses of peasants have further understood the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, thus strengthening their confidence in taking the socialist road and running cooperatives well. At the same time, the socialist education movement has promoted grain procurement and other tasks, as well as the anti-drought sowing of wheat and autumn crop protection movement.
    However, most townships and communes have not well grasped the spirit of extensive airing of views and extensive debates, so socialist education is not deep and thorough enough. It is necessary to further clarify the line between right and wrong among the masses. Many grassroots cadres have not yet truly learned the working methods of the mass line, and the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements have not been thoroughly attacked. At present, the tasks of anti-drought sowing of wheat, checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, grain purchase, and cotton purchase in the whole region are still very heavy. It is also necessary to make arduous efforts on how to mobilize cadres and members to report actual yields, distribute reasonably, save for famine, and manage households diligently and frugally.
    After repeated in-depth discussions, the meeting decided to continue to deepen the socialist education movement, carry out rectification and consolidation of communes, and resolutely implement the policy of extensive airing of views and extensive debates. The meeting held that counties, townships (communes) where socialist education has not been carried out deeply and thoroughly should conduct an inspection and summary of the previous stage of work, accept experiences and lessons; appropriately handle landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements whose destructive activities have been thoroughly exposed by the masses; quickly grasp the current production and other work, and then deeply mobilize extensive airing of views and extensive debates to carry out rectification and consolidation. The meeting held that the situation varies from place to place, and the methods can also be different. However, they must all conform to the following principles: 1. All counties must hold good three-level cadre meetings to train cadres, truly understand the purpose, significance, and methods of rectification and consolidation, thoroughly resolve cadres' concerns and ideological problems about rectification and consolidation and extensive airing of views, and learn the methods of the mass line; 2. There must be extensive airing of views and extensive debates, boldly airing, resolutely airing, and thoroughly airing; 3. There must be rectification and correction at the same time, changing the style of work; 4. Production and other work must be done well. The meeting pointed out that the key to doing a good job in socialist education and rectification and consolidation lies in cadres truly understanding the two different effects produced by the two methods of the mass line and the non-mass line. Only by adopting the method of extensive airing of views and extensive debates, fully presenting the facts and reasoning, can major issues of right and wrong be thoroughly clarified, and ideological problems can be resolved deeply and thoroughly. The meeting required all localities to consolidate the socialist ideological front in rural areas through extensive airing of views and extensive debates, thoroughly refute the capitalist ideas of well-to-do middle peasants, resolutely attack the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, further strengthen the confidence and determination of the broad masses of peasants in taking the socialist road, mobilize the enthusiasm of peasants to build socialism, overcome the individualism, departmentalism, tailism, and coercive commandism that exist among grassroots cadres, and thoroughly solve the problems in the operation and management of cooperatives, so as to achieve the goal of rectifying the style of cadres, rectifying and consolidating cooperatives, strengthening internal unity among the people, and doing a good job in production.
    In order to vigorously lead the winter production upsurge, the meeting required party organizations at all levels to correctly use the positive forces of the masses in developing production. The meeting held that the direction of agricultural production in the whole region is still to vigorously increase the yield per unit area, and strive for the region's total grain output to reach 4.244 billion catties and ginned cotton to reach 198 million catties next year. The focus of leading production in the future is to vigorously transform natural conditions and strive for steady growth in output. Five million mu of high-yield fields that are resistant to drought and flood should be developed next year. To this end, two key links must be grasped: one is to build farmland water conservancy, and the other is to increase fertilizer application.

    山东聊城地委就贯彻三中全会精神作出决定
    开好各县三级干部会统一思想
    深入发动大鸣大放大争抓紧领导冬季生产
    本报讯　据大众日报消息：中共山东省聊城地委在10月10日至17日举行扩大会议，传达中共三中全会的精神，决定继续深入开展农村社会主义教育运动，进行整风整社，并且决定发动一个规模宏大的冬季生产高潮。
    聊城专区农村经过社会主义教育和群众性的大辩论，干部、党员和农民群众的社会主义觉悟有很大提高，富裕中农的资本主义思想受到了严厉的批判，地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子的破坏活动受到了打击，广大农民对社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争有了进一步的认识，从而坚定了走社会主义道路、办好合作社的信心。同时，社会主义教育运动，推进了粮食征购等项工作和抗旱种麦保秋运动。
    但是，大部分乡社没有很好地掌握大放大鸣大争的精神，因而社会主义教育还不够深透，在群众中需要进一步划清是非界限，许多基层干部还没有真正学会群众路线的工作方法，地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子的破坏活动，还没有受到彻底打击。目前，全区抗旱种麦、查苗补苗和购粮、购棉任务还很繁重；对于如何发动干部、社员报实产量，合理分配，节约备荒，勤俭持家，也需要作艰苦的努力。
    经过反复的深入的讨论，会议决定继续深入开展社会主义教育运动，进行整风整社，坚决贯彻大鸣大放大争的方针。会议认为，凡是社会主义教育搞得不深不透的县、乡（社），都应该把前一段工作作一检查总结，接受经验教训；把群众已彻底揭露的有破坏活动的地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子进行适当的处理；把当前生产等工作迅速抓起来，进而深入发动大鸣大放大争，进行整风、整社。会议认为各地情况不同，方法也可不同。但都必须符合以下的原则精神：1、各县必须开好三级干部会议，训练干部，真正了解整风、整社的目的、意义和方法，彻底解决干部对整风、整社及大鸣大放的顾虑和思想问题，学会群众路线的方法；2、必须大鸣大放大争，大胆地放、坚决地放、彻底地放；3、必须边整边改，转变作风；4、必须搞好生产和其他工作。会议指出，搞好社会主义教育和整风、整社的关键，在于干部真正懂得群众路线和非群众路线的两种方法所产生的两种不同的效果，只有采用大鸣大放大争的办法，充分地摆事实、讲道理，大是大非才能彻底辩明，思想问题才能解决得深透。会议要求各地通过大鸣大放大争，巩固农村社会主义思想阵地，彻底驳倒富裕中农的资本主义思想，坚决打击地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子的破坏活动，进一步坚定广大农民走社会主义道路的信心和决心，调动农民建设社会主义的积极性，克服基层干部中存在的个人主义、本位主义、尾巴主义和强迫命令的思想作风，彻底解决合作社的经营管理等方面的问题，以达到整顿好干部作风、整顿巩固合作社，加强人民内部团结，搞好生产的目的。
    为了大力领导冬季生产高潮，会议要求各级党组织必须把群众的积极力量，正确地使用在发展生产方面。会议认为，全区农业生产的方向，仍是大力提高单位面积产量，明年争取全区粮食产量达到四十二亿四千万斤，皮棉达到一亿九千八百万斤。今后领导生产的重点，是大力改造自然条件，争取产量稳步增长，明年要搞好旱涝丰产田五百万亩。为此，要着重抓住两个环节，一是兴修农田水利，一是增加施肥量。
