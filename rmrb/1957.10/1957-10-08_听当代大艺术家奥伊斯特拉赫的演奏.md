    Listening to the Performance of Contemporary Great Artist Oistrakh
    Li Ling
    We heard the happy news long ago—that Oistrakh, the first generation of the most outstanding, most advanced, and world-renowned violinists cultivated after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, was coming to our country to perform. Now, this beautiful wish has finally come true. The gratitude that people feel for the Soviet government, artists, and people for their concern for us, and the boundless joy and pleasure expressed for the arrival of Oistrakh and his collaborator Yampolsky, can be imagined.
    On the 6th, Oistrakh held his first concert at the Capital People's Theater (he will hold four concerts with different programs in the capital), performing sonatas by Leclair, Brahms, and Prokofiev, as well as Tchaikovsky's "Meditation" and "Valse Sentimentale." Finally, at the enthusiastic request of the audience, he also performed Debussy's "Clair de Lune" and five other pieces.
    Oistrakh uses perfect, brilliant, and highly pure technique to reveal the ideological content of musical works truthfully and profoundly, drawing people into the depths of the music from the very beginning. The works of composers from different eras are presented to the audience one by one in a perfect manner. First is the "Sonata in D Major" by the French classical composer Leclair, elegant and delicate, with all the subtle techniques melting into the music. Due to his superb right hand, many special, varied timbres and dynamics naturally add a deeper effect to this piece.
    Brahms' "Sonata in D Minor" is a profound and more difficult work to express, but the performer in this long music, neither exaggerates nor forces artificial contrasts, but is simple and natural, trying to let the music speak for itself. He truly brings out the sincere and ardent heart of this classical writer in the late Romantic period, expressing the composer's unrestrained passion in an elegant style. The reality of realism, exploring the deepest truth in each composer's heart, is indeed the shining characteristic of the artistic creation of this most representative Russian and Soviet violin school.
    In Prokofiev's "Sonata in D Major," one can even more see the performer's serious narration of the content of the musical work. In the second movement, "Scherzo," his collaboration with Yampolsky is the peak of their joint exploration. And in the third movement, "Andante," the master's most poetic performance, the music of the pastoral flute, so elegant and peaceful, yet wild and affectionate, is particularly unforgettable. If one does not deeply penetrate the composer's heart, it is difficult to create such a realm. The majestic and fiery music of the fourth movement of this piece is also extremely characteristic.
    Oistrakh's performance talent is multifaceted, including writers with different characteristics from various eras, as well as different works by various composers. When we recall his lyrical pieces such as Tchaikovsky's "Meditation," Debussy's "Clair de Lune," and Wagner's "Albumblatt," we will be even more impressed by his rich and diverse interpretive power. Even within these pieces of the same type, their differences are so clearly shown, and their artistic creation is unified with the composer's character. For example, the passionate phrases in "Meditation," because the music itself has strong characteristics, this effect is easy to come out, but the performer handles it unusually naturally and inwardly, thus making the "passion" more weighty and deeper. Indeed, when he plays these deeply thoughtful movements, he closes his eyes and pours out his heart, indulging in the singing.
    Oistrakh is an extremely talented musician, and he has been praised as "the strongest of the strong," "the world's number one violin," and "the Paganini of Moscow." He has also received the rare Order of Lenin in the Soviet music world, as well as two Orders of Honor, the Stalin First Class Prize, and the title of People's Artist. But his labor enthusiasm and serious attitude towards his career are unmatched by many musicians. He is a famous performer, an outstanding violin professor, and also undertakes extremely heavy social work, yet he is still tireless and strives to increase his musical knowledge. He said, "If I can't hear even one musical work that I don't know in a day, then that day is wasted."
    Like all the great musicians of the world, he is faithful and cautious about his performances. Shostakovich, when talking about his responsible attitude, once said: "Needless to say, Oistrakh has played Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto more than a hundred times. Nevertheless, he still practices it over and over again all day long, as if preparing to perform it for the first time."
    The most valuable thing for us to learn from him is his love and support for the new works of domestic musicians (including some young musicians). He has played violin concertos by Shostakovich, Khachaturian, Myaskovsky, Rakov, and Kabalevsky, Prokofiev's sonatas, and many new works by domestic composers. "He is so serious, every time so enthusiastic, deeply conceiving, understanding and embodying the thoughts and emotions of the work." Shostakovich believes that his concern for new works is "a real creative help to composers."
    He said: "I think the time has come to raise the issue of closer artistic cooperation between composers and performers, so that they can understand each other more closely and deeply, learn from each other, help each other, so that both sides can benefit, and ultimately the entire Soviet musical culture can benefit." His passionate call, which contains supreme truth, has been supported and respected by contemporary composers such as Prokofiev and Khachaturian. He so frankly and sincerely contributes his artistic talents, enthusiastically defending those new works by talented composers that correctly reflect the image of Soviet reality.
    Chinese music workers, on the one hand, are honored to appreciate Oistrakh's exquisite and profound artistic performances, and at the same time, they will also gain valuable education and encouragement from his simple, sincere, clear, and realistic expression methods in artistic creation, his highly serious exploration and honing in artistic expression, his enthusiastic support and protection of new works by composers of his own nation, and his tireless dedication to teaching.

    听当代大艺术家奥伊斯特拉赫的演奏
    李凌
    我们很早就听到这个幸福的消息——苏联十月革命后培养出来的第一代最卓越的、最先进的、世界著名的小提琴家奥伊斯特拉赫要到我国来演奏。现在，这个美好的愿望是终于实现了。人们对苏联政府、艺术家、人民对我们的这种关心，所表现出来的感谢，和对奥伊斯特拉赫和他的合作者扬波尔斯基的到来，表现出无限的高兴、快慰的心情，这是可以想像得到的。
    奥伊斯特拉赫6日在首都人民剧场举行了第一个（他要在首都举行四个不同节目的音乐会）音乐会，表演了列克莱尔、勃拉姆斯、普罗科菲耶夫的奏鸣曲，及柴可夫斯基的“沉思”、“圆舞曲”。最后还被观众狂热地要求演奏了德布西的“月光”等五首乐曲。
    奥伊斯特拉赫以完美灿烂、高度纯净的技巧，来真实而深刻地揭示音乐作品的思想内容，一开始就把人引入音乐的深处。各个不同时代的作曲家的作品，一个个尽善尽美地呈现在观众之前。首先是法国古典作曲家列克莱尔的“D大调奏鸣曲”，典雅、细致，一切微妙的技巧，融化在音乐之中。由于他的右手的高超，许多特殊的、变化多端的音色和力度，自然而然使这首乐曲增添更深的效果。
    勃拉姆斯的“d小调奏鸣曲”，是深邃的、较难表现的作品，而演奏家在这首长长的音乐中，既不夸张，也不强求人为的对比，而是纯朴、自然，尽量让音乐自己说话，他真把这位处在浪漫主义后期的古典作家诚挚、灼热的真心，在典雅的风格中使作曲家不可抑止的热情体现出来。现实主义的真实，探求每个作曲家内心最深的真实，的确是这位俄罗斯、苏维埃小提琴学派最富代表性的艺术创造的光辉特点。
    在普罗科菲耶夫的“D大调奏鸣曲”中，更加看到演奏家对音乐作品内容的认真抒述。在第二段“谐譃曲”中，他和扬波尔斯基的合作，是他们共同探求的顶峰。而在第三段“行板”，大师的最富诗意的表演，那牧笛的音乐，如此幽雅、平静，却又犷野、深情，特别使人难以忘怀。如果不是深透了作曲家的心灵，是很难创造到如此的境界的。这首乐曲第四段的雄壮的火热的音乐，也是极富性格的。
    奥伊斯特拉赫的表现才能是多方面的，包括各个时代不同特性的作家，也包括各个作曲家不同的作品。当我们回思起他的柴可夫斯基的“沉思”、德布西的“月光”、华格纳的“纪念册中的一页”等抒情的乐曲，就会对他的丰富多样的解释力更加倾倒。就在这些同一类型的乐曲中，它们的分别也是如此显出，并且使它们的艺术创造和作曲家的性格统一起来。如像“沉思”中的热情乐句，由于音乐本身具有强烈的特性，这种效果是很容易出来的，而演奏家却处理得异常自然、内向，因而使“热情”更有斤两，益加深沉。的确，他在演奏到这些需要深思的乐章，他是闭目倾诉，沉迷在歌唱里面的。
    奥伊斯特拉赫是一个极富天才的音乐家，他已经被称誉为“强者中的强者”、“世界第一把小提琴”、“莫斯科的巴格尼尼”，还获得在苏联音乐界中少有的列宁勋章，和两次荣誉勋章、斯大林一等奖金、人民艺术家的称号。但是他的劳动热情，和认真对待自己的事业的态度，是许多音乐家所不及的。他是名演奏家，又是杰出的小提琴教授，还担负极繁重的社会工作，然而他依然辛劳不倦的，悉力以增加自己的音乐知识。他说：“假如在一天里不能听到那怕一部我所不知道的音乐作品，那末这一天就算是白过了。”
    他像所有的世界的大音乐家一样，对于自己的表演是忠实而谨慎的，萧斯塔科维奇在谈到他这种负责的态度时曾说：“像柴可夫斯基的小提琴协奏曲，不用说，奥伊斯特拉赫演奏过已经不止一百次了。尽管如此，他还是成天地再三练习，就好像准备初次出场演奏它似的。”
    他最值得我们学习的地方，是对本国音乐家（包括一些年青的音乐家）的新作品的爱护与扶植。他演奏过萧斯塔科维奇、哈恰图良、米亚斯科夫斯基、拉科夫和卡巴列夫斯基等人的小提琴协奏曲，普罗科菲耶夫的奏鸣曲和许多本国作曲家的新作，“他是那样认真，每次都是如此热情，深入构思，理解与体现作品的思想和情感”。萧斯塔科维奇认为他对新作品的这种关心是“对作曲家真正创造性的帮助”。
    他说过：“我认为提出作曲家与演奏家之间在艺术上进一步紧密的合作问题的时机已经到了，让他们更密切、更深入地互相了解，互相学习，让他们互相帮助，从而使双方都得到益处，并且最后使苏维埃音乐文化的整体得到益处。”他的这种包含无上真理的热诚的号召，得到了当代作曲家如普罗科菲耶夫、哈恰图良等人的赞助与推崇。他是如此坦率而真挚地贡献出自己的艺术才能，热心地来捍卫那些天才作曲家们的正确的反映了苏维埃现实生活形象的新作品。
    中国音乐工作者，一方面以欣赏到奥伊斯特拉赫的精湛深刻的艺术表演而荣幸，同时也会从他对艺术创造上的纯朴、诚挚、鲜明、真实的现实主义表现方法，对艺术表现上那种高度的认真探求、磨练的作风，对自己民族的作曲家的新作品的热诚扶助、保护，和对教学的孜孜不倦这许多方面，获得至贵的教育和鼓舞。
