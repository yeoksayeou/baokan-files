Reporting from our newspaper correspondent Miao Yiqin: In the fields, by the threshing grounds, at street corners, on the heated brick beds – everywhere, people are passionately debating the question of whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road. This is the scene of the recent Great Debate at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in the Babaoshan Township, Shijingshan District, on the outskirts of Beijing. When this cooperative initially started the Great Debate, it wasn't nearly so lively. Many debate meetings couldn't even get off the ground. Only a few cadres and activists spoke, and only a small number of cooperative members, including some poor and lower-middle peasants, attended. Even those who did attend the meetings didn't speak up actively.

The Masses' Various Concerns

Why weren't the masses, including many poor and lower-middle peasants, actively participating in the Great Debate? What ideological concerns did they have? The leadership studied and analyzed the situation.

　　"How Can I Correct Others When I Am Not Upright Myself?"

One situation was this: Some poor and lower-middle peasants supported collectivization and felt that their happiness was inextricably linked to it. However, because peasants have selfish and self-interested ideas, and like to seek small advantages, they often went out to "scavenge for fertilizer," such as herding sheep or cutting grass. In severe cases, this even affected their attendance in the cooperative. Therefore, when this Great Debate began, these people felt, "How can I correct others when I am not upright myself?" They felt they lacked justification, lacked confidence, couldn't hold their heads high, couldn't stand up straight, and dared not criticize others.

　　"How Can We Expose Each Other When We're All One Family?"

Another situation was this: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative had a special circumstance: A production team or production group often consisted of people with the same surname. Therefore, they weren't just ordinary neighbors, but also uncles, nephews, brothers, uncles, grandsons, etc. Even though there were vast differences in wealth, they were all descended from the same ancestor. Therefore, they felt, "We're all one family, how can we expose each other?" "As long as I wholeheartedly work for the cooperative, why should I care about other people's affairs?"

　　"Collectivization is Good for Others, But Not For Me"

Yet another situation was this: A very small number of poor and lower-middle peasants, after joining the cooperative, experienced hardship due to natural disasters, manpower shortages, etc. They took out loans from the credit cooperative and fell into debt. They didn't see the real reason for their poor living conditions clearly, but simply said: They didn't owe any debts when they worked individually in the past, but now they've incurred debts. Collectivization is good for others, but not for them. Therefore, they didn't actively participate in the debate either.

Methods to Resolve Concerns

In response to the above situations, the work team, township, and cooperative cadres adopted methods such as holding small-scale discussion meetings, and going deep into the fields, neighborhoods, individual connections, and heart-to-heart talks to conduct lively, practical, detailed, and patient education on various specific ideological concerns.

　　First Recognize Your Own Minor Wrongs

　　Then Criticize the Rich Middle Peasants' Major Wrongs

For the first type of people, on the one hand, their awareness was raised, so they could recognize their mistakes. On the other hand, it was explained that these mistakes were minor, and as long as they could admit and correct them, the masses would forgive them. For example, the poor peasant Wang Yulin used to only care about cutting grass to sell himself, which affected his attendance in the cooperative. When the Great Debate began, he always lowered his head silently whenever there was criticism of the rich middle peasant Du Fu, who had serious capitalist tendencies. After understanding his ideological situation, the work team cadre talked to him, explaining that it was wrong for cooperative members to "scavenge for fertilizer" outside. If you scavenge for fertilizer, and he scavenges for fertilizer, who will do the work in the cooperative? And they did the math with him: Wang Yulin can earn at most less than a yuan a day by cutting grass to sell. If he works in the cooperative, even based on last year's harvest, he can still earn 1.7 yuan. If everyone doesn't go out to scavenge for fertilizer and works hard in the cooperative, are you still afraid of not exceeding 1.7 yuan? In addition, it was explained to him that these mistakes are minor wrongs, and are different from the situation of the rich middle peasant Du Fu, who was agitating to withdraw from the cooperative and encouraging cooperative members to withdraw. He shouldn't confuse minor rights and wrongs because he has some minor wrongs himself. He should admit and correct his shortcomings, and at the same time, he should properly criticize Du Fu this time. Later, at a small group debate, Wang Yulin publicly admitted his mistake again, and the masses were very satisfied, and he unloaded his burden.

　　Two Roads are as Incompatible as Water and Fire

　　Even If You're One Family With the Same Surname, You Must Clearly Distinguish Them

For the second type of people: In addition to general class education, two main questions were raised for them. One question was: Is it right to be unwilling to participate in the debate because you are one family with the same surname? It must be explained that we want to take the collectivization road, and they want to take the capitalist road. These two roads are as incompatible as water and fire. Therefore, no matter how close you are, as long as they oppose taking the collectivization road, we should criticize them. When the poor peasant Li Wenhe was criticizing the rich middle peasant Li Shizhong, he was unwilling to speak. The work team cadre inspired his class consciousness by recalling and comparing the past. He said to him: "Before collectivization, you couldn't even afford cornmeal buns, and you lived a very difficult life. What about Li Shizhong? He had a cart, a mule, and plenty to eat and drink. He saw with his own eyes that you didn't have enough to eat, but did he care about you? He didn't give you a single grain of food, but wasn't he enjoying his blessings while you suffered? Now that we have collectivization, you have clothes to wear, food to eat, and even a surplus. If you don't criticize his capitalist ideas, and he undermines the cooperative, won't he still be enjoying his blessings while you suffer?" This made Li Wenhe think clearly. In addition to providing education in this area to this group of people, another question was: If you alone take the collectivization road, and don't criticize capitalist ideas, can collectivization be successful? In this regard, the education of the new lower-middle peasant Wang Haiquan was a typical example: Wang Haiquan's family of six didn't have a single grain of food when they joined the cooperative. On the day they joined, cooperative cadres carried a large bag of grain to them. In the past few years, their living standards have improved year by year, and last year alone, their income was more than 800 yuan. He knew that collectivization was good, but he just couldn't tear down the relationship. When the work team cadres were educating him, they cited the example of the "July 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in the neighboring Gucheng Township: There was a rich middle peasant in that cooperative who had serious capitalist ideas. Last winter and spring, he caused a big stir about withdrawing from the cooperative, and even pulled his livestock out. Under his influence, other rich middle peasants also caused trouble about withdrawing from the cooperative and pulling out their livestock, which seriously affected the consolidation of the cooperative. Isn't this precisely the result of the rich middle peasants' capitalist ideas not being criticized? This fact made Wang Haiquan realize: It's not enough for me to work hard alone, we must also criticize capitalist ideas.

　　Guide Memories, Comparisons, and Help With Accounting

　　All the Poor People Have Benefited From Collectivization

For the third type of people with vague understanding, the main approach was also to help them do the math through recollections and comparisons. For example, the wife of the poor peasant Wu Yugui had a tumor in her stomach, and the credit cooperative lent him 400 yuan, which allowed him to have surgery at Peking University Hospital and cure the disease, but it left him in debt. The work team helped him specifically calculate: How did this debt come about? Did collectivization cause him to incur it? Wu Yugui had a total of fifteen mu of land. Before collectivization, each mu of land could yield one shi of grain, for a total of fifteen shi of grain. Good and bad grain combined, at 15 yuan per shi, totaled 225 yuan, plus sometimes growing some cash crops, which could exceed 500 yuan at most. After joining the cooperative, the two laborers earned more than 800 yuan last year alone. Hasn't their income clearly increased? To talk about incurring debt, after researching the reasons for incurring debt, it was caused by his wife's illness. You say collectivization is no good for you, but in fact, if there were no collectivization, and your wife got sick, where would you borrow money from? Isn't this precisely the benefit of collectivization? After such accounting and comparison, Wu Yugui not only realized that the debt was not caused by collectivization, but on the contrary, without collectivization, it's unknown whether his wife's life could have been saved?

When Concerns Were Eliminated, the Debate Unfolded

After the masses resolved the above various ideological concerns, their enthusiasm for participating in the Great Debate soared to an unprecedented level. Originally, the number of speakers at debate meetings was less than 30%, but now more than 80% of the people can actively speak. After Wang Yulin, a poor peasant, had his concerns resolved, he was able to criticize Du Fu with confidence at every meeting. Once, he criticized Du Fu, saying, "Even after the livestock entered the cooperative, you still go and feel them every day to see if they're thin or fat. In fact, you want to pull them back!" Du Fu retorted, "I'm protecting public property!" Wang Yulin immediately said, "You say it so nicely! But it's all nonsense. If you say you're protecting public property, why don't you protect the crops in the field? There are livestock all over the shed, why do you only protect yours?" These words left Du Fu speechless. The masses not only debated with them at meetings, but also launched debates with the capitalist ideas and rhetoric of rich middle peasants everywhere, in the fields, by the threshing grounds, at street corners, and on the heated brick beds. Li Shizhong, the rich middle peasant who was previously called the "volunteer propagandist for withdrawing from the cooperative," was working in his private plot one day. Li Guanglin, Wang Zhenyang, and a dozen others were working in the cooperative. When they saw Li Shizhong, they called him over during a break. Everyone sat on the edge of the field and did the math with Li Shizhong: Li Shizhong has three private plots, totaling more than three mu, and his annual income cannot exceed 200 yuan at most. If he actively works in the cooperative, he can earn 2,500 points a year, and one point is worth 0.17 yuan, which can earn more than 400 yuan. They asked Li Shizhong, "You're working in the private plot, with no reputation and no profit, what exactly are you doing it for?" The poor peasant Lao Dingkuan lived across the street from Li Shizhong. Lao Dingkuan went to Li Shizhong's house repeatedly to do the math with him. Lao Dingkuan said: "You say collectivization is no good, but in fact, you're not working hard yourself. Even I, an old man, earned four or five hundred yuan last year. You're younger than me, and you also have half a laborer. If you two and a half laborers work hard in the cooperative, you can earn at least more than 1,000 yuan."

After the masses launched large and small-scale debates everywhere, some of the rich middle peasants who originally had serious capitalist ideas began to admit their mistakes in the face of the facts. Li Shizhong said emotionally to people: "The Great Debate saved me, I want to follow the poor and lower-middle peasants and take the collectivization road." In recent days, he has been actively attending work in the cooperative.

### 针对具体顾虑  进行具体教育  中苏友好农业社是这样发动贫农和下中农参加大辩论的

    针对具体顾虑  进行具体教育
    中苏友好农业社是这样发动贫农和下中农参加大辩论的
    本报讯  记者缪宜琴报道：在田头，在场边，在街口，在炕上，到处在热烈地争辩着走社会主义还是走资本主义道路的问题。这是京郊石景山区八宝山乡中苏友好农业合作社的近日大辩论的情形。这个社在开始进行大辩论时，不仅没有这样热烈，而且许多辩论会开都开不下去，会上只有少数干部和积极分子讲话，社员群众包括一部分贫农和下中农到的很少，到了会的人也不积极发言。
    群众的种种顾虑
    这个社的群众甚至不少贫农和下中农为什么没有积极参加大辩论呢？他们存在哪些思想顾虑呢？领导上作了研究和分析。
      “自己不正如何正人”
    一种情况是：部分贫农和下中农对合作化是拥护的，感到自己的幸福和合作化休戚相关，但是由于农民有自私自利、爱讨小便宜的思想，他们也常常出去“抄肥”，如放放羊，打打草，情况严重的人甚至影响到合作社的出勤。因此，当这次大辩论开始时，这部分人就感到“自己不正，如何正人”？自己是理不直，气不壮，抬不起头，伸不直腰，不敢批判别人。
      “一家一姓怎好揭底”
    另一种情况是：中苏友好社有这样一个特殊情况：一个生产队、一个生产组往往就是一个姓，因此，他们不只是一般的邻居关系，而且还是什么叔侄、兄弟、伯叔、祖孙的关系，尽管贫富相差悬殊，总是一个祖宗，因此，他们就感到：“总是一家一姓的，怎能揭底呢？”“只要我自己一心一意为着社就行了，人家的事何必管呢”？“合作化对别人好对自己不好”
    再一种情况是：极少数贫农和下中农在入社后，由于天灾人祸、劳动力不足等情况，生活有困难，向信用合作社贷了款，欠了债，他们没有看清楚自己生活不好的真正原因，只是说：过去单干时不欠债，现在拉下了债，合作化对别人好，对他不好。因此，他们也不积极参加辩论。
    解除顾虑的办法
    针对以上情况，工作队、乡、社干部采取了召开小型座谈会以及深入田间、里弄、个别串连、谈心等方式，对各种具体思想顾虑，进行了生动的、实际的、细致的、耐心的教育。
      首先要认识自己的小非
      再批判富裕中农的大非
    对于第一种人，一方面提高他们的觉悟，使他们认识到自己的错误，另方面说明这种错误是小是小非，只要能承认并改正错误，群众是会原谅的。如贫农王玉林过去只顾自己割草出去卖，影响到社里出勤，大辩论开始时，每次批判有严重的资本主义思想的富裕中农杜甫时，他总是默默地低着头。工作队干部在了解他的思想情况后，就找他谈话，向他说明：合作社社员在外面“抄肥”是不对的，如果你也抄肥，他也抄肥，合作社的活计谁来干？并且向他算了账：王玉林割草出去卖，一天顶多挣不到一块钱，在社里劳动，就以去年年景算，还能挣到一块七角，如果大家都不出去抄肥，在社里好好劳动，还怕不超过一块七角吗？另外，也向他说明这些错误是小是小非，和富裕中农杜甫闹退社、拉社员退社的情况是不一样的，不能因为自己有点小是小非，就弄不清大是大非，而应该承认、改正自己的缺点，同时这次还要好好批判杜甫。后来，在一次小组辩论会上，王玉林又当众承认了自己的错误，群众很满意，他自己的包袱也解开了。
      两条道路水火不能相容
      一家一姓也要辩个分明
    对第二种人：除进行一般的阶级教育外，主要向他们提出两个问题。一个问题是：因为是一家一姓，不愿参加辩论，对不对？说明我们要走合作化道路，他们要走资本主义道路，这两条道路像水和火一样不能相容，因此，不管是什么至亲骨肉，只要反对走合作化道路，我们就应该批判他。贫农李文和在批判富裕中农李士忠时，不愿发言，工作组干部就通过回忆，对比，启发他的阶级觉悟，对他说：“在合作化以前，你连玉米面窝窝头也吃不上，日子过得挺困难，李士忠呢？有大车，有骡子，有吃有喝。他亲眼看见你上顿不接下顿，可是他管你了没有？并没有给你一粒粮食，还不是他享他的福，你受你的罪。现在合作化了，你有穿有吃还有余，你如果不批判他的资本主义思想，他要搞垮合作社，还不是他享他的福，你受你的罪。”这一来，李文和的脑子想通了。在这部分人中，除进行这方面教育外；另一个问题是：如果你一个人走合作化道路，不批判资本主义思想，究竟能不能搞好合作化？在这方面，对新下中农王海泉的教育是一个典型例子：王海泉一家六口，入社时一粒粮食也没有，入社那天，合作社干部背了一大袋粮食送去，几年来，生活年年提高，去年一年收入八百多元。他知道合作化好，可是他就是撕不破情面，工作组干部在向他进行教育时，举出邻乡古城乡“七一”农业合作社的例子：该社有一个富裕中农资本主义思想严重，去冬今春，闹退社闹得很凶，把牲口也拉出去了，在他影响下，别的富裕中农也闹退社，拉牲口，严重影响到合作社的巩固。这不正是富裕中农的资本主义思想没有受到批判的结果吗？这一事实，使王海泉认识到：光我一个人干是不行的，还得批判资本主义思想。
      引导回忆对比帮助算账
      穷人都沾了合作化的光
    对第三种认识模糊的人，主要也是通过回忆、对比，帮他算账。如贫农武玉贵媳妇肚里长了瘤，信用合作社贷给他四百元，才在北大医院开了刀，治好了病，但是却拉下了债。工作组就帮他具体算一算：这个债是怎样拉下的？是不是合作化让他拉的？武玉贵一共十五亩地，合作化前，每亩地能打一石粮食，共打十五石粮食，好坏粮食，每石以十五元算，共二百二十五元，加上有时种点经济作物，顶多超过不了五百元。入社后，二个劳动力去年一年就挣了八百多元。收入不明明增加了吗？要说拉债，研究拉债原因，是你媳妇生病拉下的，你说合作化对你没好处，其实如果没有合作化你媳妇生了病，还没处借钱呢？这不正是合作化的好处？经过这样算账、对比以后，武玉贵不仅认识到：拉债并不是合作化让拉的，相反的，不是合作化，媳妇的命不知是否保得住呢？顾虑一解除辩论展开了
    当群众解决了以上各种各样的思想顾虑以后，参加大辩论的积极性就空前高涨起来，原来开辩论会，发言人数不到30％，现在80％以上的人都能积极发言了。贫农王玉林在解除顾虑后，每次会议上，都能理直气壮地批判杜甫，一次，他批判杜甫说：“牲口入了社，还天天去摸摸是瘦了，还是肥了，其实心里是想拉回去呀！”杜甫反驳说：“我这是爱护公共财产嘛！”王玉林连忙说：“嘴巴上说得好亮堂呀！其实完全是鬼话，如果说是爱护公共财产，满地庄稼，你怎么不爱护？满棚牲口，你又为什么单单爱护你那一条。”这一席话，将杜甫驳得哑口无言。群众不仅在会上和他们辩论，在田头、在场边、在街口、在炕上，到处和富裕中农的资本主义思想和言论展开了辩论。过去群众称呼为“退社义务宣传员”的富裕中农李士忠，有一天在自己自留地里干活，李广林、王振阳等十几人在社里劳动，看到了李士忠，就在休息时，将李士忠叫来，大家坐在田头上，给李士忠算了一笔账：李士忠三块自留地，一共三亩多，一年收入最多超过不了二百元，如在社里积极劳动，一年能挣二千五百分，一个分一角七分钱，可挣四百多元，他们问李士忠，你在自留地干活，既无名，又无利，究竟为了那一桩？贫农老丁宽和李士忠门对门，老丁宽三番五次地找到李士忠家里，和他算账。老丁宽说：你说合作化不好，其实是你自己不好好劳动，凭我这个老头儿，去年还挣了四、五百元，你比我年纪小，另外还有一个半劳动力，你们二个半劳动力，如果好好在社里劳动，至少能挣一千多元。
    群众到处展开了大、小辩论会以后，一部分原来资本主义思想严重的富裕中农，在事实面前开始承认了自己的错误。李士忠感动地对人说：大辩论救了我，我要跟贫农、下中农走合作化道路。连日来，他积极在社里出勤。
