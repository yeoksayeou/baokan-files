Xinhua News Agency, October 16th: According to TASS, by 6:00 AM on October 16th, the satellite had orbited the Earth approximately one hundred and sixty-eight times, covering a distance of about seven million two hundred thousand kilometers.

Research on the observation results shows that the distance between the carrier rocket and the satellite continues to increase: on the morning of the 16th, the carrier rocket had traveled approximately eleven minutes, or five thousand three hundred kilometers, further than the satellite. According to calculations, by the evening of the 16th, the carrier rocket would be nearly thirteen minutes ahead, and in terms of longitude, the carrier rocket would be approximately three and a quarter degrees east of the satellite.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 16th: News of sightings of the artificial satellite and carrier rocket continues to pour in from all over the Soviet Union. The constantly changing brightness of the carrier rocket has aroused widespread interest.

Staff at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory observed the carrier rocket through a telescope at 5:06:54 AM local time on the 14th. It is said that the carrier rocket resembled a slightly reddish small star, with a brightness that varied, sometimes as bright as a star in the Ursa Major constellation, and sometimes greatly dimmed. Observatory staff estimated that this phenomenon may be due to the slender rocket having an irregular shape and constantly rotating. About seven minutes after the rocket appeared, at 5:13:56 AM, a new moving bright spot appeared in the telescope's field of view, not far from the α star in the Canes Venatici constellation. Its brightness was much weaker than the carrier rocket. This was the artificial satellite, moving smoothly among the stars in the eastern sky, moving roughly from north-northeast to southeast. The telescope observed the satellite for a total of fifteen seconds.

Staff at the Pulkovo Observatory in Leningrad observed the satellite and rocket's movement on the 7th, 9th, 10th, and 13th. They used precision instruments to determine the satellite's trajectory and coordinates. The rocket's brightness varied extremely dramatically. It was sometimes brighter than a medium-sized star, and sometimes its brightness dropped to about 1% of its original value, making it almost invisible.

　　人造卫星运行七百多万公里
    运载火箭亮度多变并继续往前赶
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社讯：到10月16日六点为止，卫星已经环绕地球转了一百六十八圈左右，经过的路程约有七百二十万公里。
    对观察结果的研究表明，运载火箭和卫星之间的距离继续增加：16日早晨运载火箭比卫星多走了约十一分钟的路程，即五千三百公里，根据计算，到16日晚上，运载火箭将领先近十三分钟的路程，就经度来说，运载火箭将跑在卫星以东约三点二五度的地方。
    据新华社莫斯科16日电　苏联各地不断传来看到人造卫星和运载火箭的消息。运载火箭亮度的不断变化引起了普遍的兴趣。
    克里米亚天文物理观测所工作人员在14日早上当地时间五点六分五十四秒用望远镜看到了运载火箭。据说，运载火箭像一颗微微发红的小星，其亮度是会变化的，有时亮得像大熊星座中的一颗星，有时又大大减弱。据观测所工作人员估计，这种现象可能是因为细长的火箭具有不规则的外形而又时时转动的原故。在火箭出现后七分钟左右，五点十三分五十六秒在天文望远镜视野中离猎犬星座的∝星不远的地方出现了新的移动的亮点，它的亮度比运载火箭要弱得多。这是人造卫星，它在天空东部群星中平稳地移动，移动方向大致是北北东到东南。天文望远镜看到卫星的时间共有十五秒。
    列宁格勒普尔科沃天文台工作人员7日、9日、10日、13日都看到了卫星和火箭的运行。他们利用精密的仪器确定了卫星运行的道路和座标。火箭亮度变化极为剧烈。它有时比中等星还亮，有时亮度又降到原来的1％左右，几乎无法看见。
