Notification from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

The fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution is approaching. The October Revolution marked a new era in human history, and set an example for the working class and other working people around the world in their struggle for liberation. The victory of the Chinese revolution is a continuation of the victory of the October Socialist Revolution.

In the forty years since the October Revolution, a poor and backward Russia that was once oppressed and full of exploitation has been built into a great socialist country that is free from oppression and exploitation, and is prosperous and strong. This fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system.

Because the Soviet Union has been built into a great socialist country, it has powerfully encouraged the struggle of the working class and other working people around the world to free themselves from oppression and fight for liberation; powerfully helped the establishment, consolidation and development of other socialist countries; powerfully deterred the realization of imperialist war plans; and powerfully supported the independent liberation movement of oppressed nations. The great October Revolution is the banner of human happiness and world peace.

The victory of our country's democratic revolution and socialist revolution, as well as the great achievements of our socialist construction, are inseparable from the example and help of the Soviet Union. Therefore, warmly celebrating and deeply publicizing the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution has extremely important political significance.

The publicity activities in factories and mining enterprises should focus on the following content:

    *   Publicize the great achievements of the Soviet Union's socialist construction, the great achievements of science and technology, and the improvement of people's cultural and material lives;
    *   Publicize the spirit of selfless sacrifice and hard work shown by the Soviet working class and other working people for the victory of the revolution and the victory of socialist construction;
    *   Publicize the great role of the Soviet Union in the movement to defend world peace;
    *   Publicize the Soviet Union's great and selfless assistance to our country's revolution and socialist construction;
    *   Publicize our achievements in learning from the Soviet Union.

In order to do a good job in the above publicity work, trade union organizations at all levels should, under the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, and in the unified arrangement of the preparatory committee for celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution that has been organized locally, do a good job in celebration and publicity activities; at the same time, pay attention to the following tasks:

    1.  From now until around November 7th, a wave of commemoration and publicity for the October Revolution should be launched;
    2.  Trade union newspapers and periodicals, factory and enterprise blackboards, and wired broadcasting stations should make plans to publicize the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution and do a good job in this publicity work;
    3.  Trade union cultural palaces and clubs should actively hold commemorative meetings, gatherings, report meetings, exhibitions, etc., according to their own conditions. Where there are Soviet experts, Soviet experts should be invited to participate in commemorative and celebration activities, and workers and other comrades who have been to the Soviet Union can also be invited to make reports;
    4.  Trade union libraries should widely publicize Soviet books and periodicals and books and periodicals in our country that study Soviet experience;
    5.  Trade union film teams can consult with local government cultural departments, and if possible, hold a Soviet film week for employees and their families to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, and make full use of the slides produced by slide factories in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to publicize the great achievements of the Soviet Union.

At present, factories and mining enterprises are carrying out rectification and socialist education movements. The above-mentioned publicity and activities should be carried out in conjunction with the rectification and socialist education movements of factories and mining enterprises, and should be regarded as an important part of carrying out socialist education for employees, so that employees and their families can generally receive socialist and internationalist education. Through this education, we will further improve the consciousness level and labor enthusiasm of employees, conscientiously learn from the Soviet Union, carry forward the spirit of hard work, and build the country diligently and thriftily, and push forward our country's socialist construction.

Notification from the Communist Youth League Central Committee, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation

1.  This year is the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. The great October Revolution opened a new era in human history, illuminated the common path of the proletariat of all countries, and inspired the will and confidence of the working people and all oppressed nations around the world in their struggle. The Chinese people's revolution was victorious precisely along the path of the October Revolution. On November 7th this year, the Chinese people and the working people of the world will solemnly celebrate this great festival. For the vast number of young people in our country, under the current international situation, when the struggle against rightists in the country has achieved a major victory and nationwide socialist ideological education is being carried out, commemorating this festival and receiving a Marxist-Leninist and socialist education from it is of great political significance. The organizations of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation at all levels should attach importance to this work and actively mobilize and organize young people to participate in various celebration activities in accordance with the decisions made by the Chinese People's Preparatory Committee for Celebrating the Fortieth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

2.  In various activities celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, efforts should be made to enable young people to understand the following points:

    (1) The great achievements made by the Soviet Union in all aspects in the forty years since the victory of the October Revolution show that the socialist system has incomparable superiority over the capitalist system. Young people in our country should more firmly take the socialist road.
    (2) The class struggle in our country today has not died out. Enemies at home and abroad and bourgeois rightists are still trying to restore capitalism at all times. Therefore, we must consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and resolutely strive for the complete victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts in our country, and smash the various fallacies of bourgeois rightists against the Soviet Union, against the Communist Party, against socialism, and against Marxism-Leninism, and fight to defend the path of the October Revolution.
    (3) The leadership of the Party is the primary condition for building socialism. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, no socialism, and no bright future for the youth of our country.
    (4) The Soviet Union is a strong fortress for defending world peace. The Soviet Union has always adhered to the principle of internationalism and given China and other socialist countries sincere, comprehensive, huge, and fraternal assistance. We must maintain and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and constantly consolidate and develop the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and strengthen the internationalist unity of the world proletariat.
    (5) Learn from the advanced experience and revolutionary spirit of the Soviet people and youth in building socialism, and carry forward the excellent qualities of our people and youth in not fearing difficulties, working hard, building the country diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily.

3.  Organizations of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation at all levels should organize young people to actively participate in the celebration and study activities organized uniformly by the local area. At the same time, they can also initiate or organize some activities according to the specific conditions of the local area and unit. For example: organize theme meetings and symposiums on various issues related to the path of the October Revolution; hold get-togethers for young people from China and the Soviet Union and socialist countries; invite comrades who have visited the Soviet Union to introduce the situation in the Soviet Union; invite experts from various fields to report on the achievements of the Soviet Union in science, technology, culture, and art; in places where conditions permit, organize young people to visit factories, mines, farms, and other enterprises built with Soviet assistance; organize young people to watch related movies, books, and exhibitions; hold introductions or recitations of Soviet novels, stories, and poems, and Soviet music appreciation meetings; learn "Moscow-Beijing" and other songs that strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship; and so on. In short, we must adapt to local conditions and strive to carry out the publicity celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution universally and deeply.

4.  Organizations of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation at all levels should regard the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution as an integral part of conducting in-depth socialist ideological education for young people and formulate work plans. The central and local League newspapers, League periodicals, Young Pioneers newspapers, Young Pioneers periodicals, and other youth publications should take the publicity of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution as one of the reporting centers for the fourth quarter, conduct publicity in a planned manner, and pay attention to providing grassroots organizations with necessary popular publicity materials.

Notification from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

The fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution is approaching. The Joint Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has, in accordance with the proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, established the Chinese People's Preparatory Committee for Celebrating the Fortieth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and passed a resolution calling on people of all circles across the country to solemnly and grandly celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. Our women's federations at all levels across the country must warmly respond to this call, and under the leadership of the local Party committees, according to the level of awareness of women, closely integrate with the socialist ideological education work currently being carried out across the country, and widely publicize to women across the country the great significance of the October Socialist Revolution in opening up the path to the liberation of mankind worldwide, and publicize that the unity and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is an important condition for promoting our country's socialist construction and an important guarantee for world peace. We must call on women across the country to establish a firm determination to follow the Communist Party on the socialist road, learn from the brilliant example of Soviet women in building the country diligently and thriftily and managing households diligently and thriftily, and make contributions to enhancing the great, unbreakable unity and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Our women's federations at all levels should, in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Joint Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, suggest that relevant parties conduct publicity and education among both men and women, and the women's federations themselves at all levels should conduct processed publicity and education among women. The content of the processed publicity and education mainly includes the following three points:

1.  Publicize that the great October Socialist Revolution illuminated the path to the liberation of women worldwide. The October Socialist Revolution first enabled Soviet women to forever get rid of their oppressed, exploited, and enslaved status, and become masters with full and equal rights politically, economically, culturally, socially, and in family life. In the past forty years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have defended and developed the achievements of the October Socialist Revolution, and have achieved great victories in socialist construction. Soviet women and the Soviet people live a beautiful and happy life together, and have created excellent conditions for the healthy growth of children. The improvement of Soviet women's lives and status in all aspects powerfully proves the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, women in our country have followed the glorious path opened up by the October Socialist Revolution, taken Soviet women as an example, bravely participated in the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, and together with the people of the country, achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. In the future, we must continue to learn from Soviet women, resolutely maintain and consolidate the socialist system, further improve socialist consciousness, and strive for the complete victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts in our country.
2.  We must learn from the brilliant example of Soviet women in building the country diligently and thriftily and managing households diligently and thriftily. The Soviet Union is a great socialist country. The happy life of the Soviet people today is the result of their arduous struggle, hard work, and overcoming various difficulties. In any difficult years or work posts, Soviet women have made great contributions to the motherland and socialist construction alongside men. The example of Soviet women diligently building the country and overcoming difficulties to master scientific, cultural, and technical knowledge is forever worthy of our study. Soviet women are not only activists on the front lines of national construction, but also experts in managing households diligently and thriftily. They regard diligent and thrifty household management as an important guarantee for the wealthy life of individuals and families, an important aspect of developing the construction of a socialist country, and a virtue of socialist families. Therefore, with an attitude of responsibility to the country, they manage household affairs diligently and thriftily, carefully calculate, rationally arrange labor, study, rest time, and plan family expenditures, practice strict economy, and pay attention to savings. They also set an example in educating their children to become successors to communist construction who love socialism, love labor, are hardworking and simple, and are physically healthy.

    The heroic deeds of Soviet women have played a huge role in encouraging women in our country to bravely and actively participate in the revolutionary struggle and construction. Now that the socialist transformation in our country has been basically completed, and we need to further consolidate and develop socialist construction, we must continue to learn from the hard work of Soviet women, build the country diligently and thriftily, and manage households diligently and thriftily, to make greater contributions to our great socialist construction.
3.  Publicize the great, unbreakable unity and friendship between the people and women of China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is a strong fortress for defending world peace. She has made great contributions to defending world peace and promoting human progress. In the past and present, the Soviet government and people have given comprehensive and selfless assistance to our country's socialist construction, which is one of the indispensable and important conditions for the rapid development of our country's socialist construction. In helping the people of our country learn advanced science and technology, Soviet experts attach importance to the training and assistance of women in our country, which we will never forget. Women across the country must protect Sino-Soviet friendship like the apples of our eyes and constantly strive to consolidate and develop the deep, unbreakable, great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

It is hoped that women's federations at all levels, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, will put forward specific publicity plans for processing for women in accordance with the overall plan. Assist relevant parties in implementing the principle of launching together by both men and women, and try to organize women to participate in various gatherings, exhibitions, cultural and artistic performances, etc. held locally to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution. At the same time, the women's federation can hold various report meetings, symposiums, etc. suitable for women according to needs and possibilities. Women's publications run by women's federations at all levels, as well as women's supplements jointly run with relevant units, should plan to do a good job in publicizing the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution in accordance with the above-mentioned publicity points. Urban women's federation organizations can also cooperate with local post offices to publicize and promote the "Soviet Women" magazine and solicit subscribers among female employees, intellectual women, and housewives, so that more women can often and more specifically learn from Soviet women through this magazine.

Instructions of the Central China National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

2.  Regarding the specific organizational work of the celebration activities, the organizations of the National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce at all levels should:

    (2) Plan to organize members of the National Construction Association and industrialists and businessmen to actively participate in the local celebration meetings held on the festival or on the eve of the festival.
    (3) In addition to organizing industrialists and businessmen to actively participate in report meetings, exhibitions, and cultural activities commemorating the October Revolution uniformly organized locally, we can also promote industrialists and businessmen to study relevant documents commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the Socialist Revolution, and hold special report meetings for industrialists and businessmen separately, inviting responsible comrades from the Party and government to give reports in combination with the specific circumstances of the industrial and commercial circles, and disseminate the contents of the reports level by level, so that every household knows about them, and the vast number of industrialists and businessmen receive a socialist ideological education.

The organizations of the two associations in various places should cooperate closely, and under the leadership of the local Party and government, cooperate with relevant parties to do a good job in various celebration activities and publicity and education work.

    中华全国总工会的通知
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的四十周年就要到了。十月革命给人类历史划出了一个新的时代，十月革命给全世界工人阶级和其他劳动人民作出了争取解放的榜样，中国革命的胜利，就是十月社会主义革命胜利的继续。
    十月革命四十年来，把一个曾经是遭受压迫、充满剥削的贫困落后的俄国，建设成为一个没有压迫、没有剥削的富强而繁荣的伟大的社会主义国家，这充分证明了社会主义制度的优越性。
    由于苏联建成了一个伟大的社会主义国家，它就有力地鼓舞了全世界的工人阶级和其他劳动人民为摆脱压迫争取解放的斗争；有力地帮助了其他社会主义国家的建立、巩固和发展；有力地阻抑了帝国主义者的战争计划的实现；有力地支持了被压迫民族的独立解放运动。伟大的十月革命是人类幸福和世界和平的旗帜。
    我国的民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，以及我国社会主义建设的伟大成就，是和苏联的榜样、苏联的帮助分不开的，所以热烈地庆祝和深入地宣传十月革命四十周年，具有极其重大的政治意义。
    在厂矿企业中的宣传活动，应着重下列内容：
    宣传苏联社会主义建设的伟大成就，科学技术的伟大成就，人民文化和物质生活的改善；

    团中央、青联、学联的通知
    一、今年，是伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。伟大的十月革命，开辟了人类历史的新纪元，照亮了各国无产阶级的共同道路，鼓舞着全世界劳动人民和一切被压迫民族斗争的意志和信心。中国人民的革命正是沿着十月革命的道路取得胜利的。在今年的11月7日，中国人民和全世界劳动人民将庄严隆重地庆祝这一伟大的节日。对我国广大青年来说，在当前的国际形势下，在国内反右派斗争已经取得重大胜利，全民性的社会主义思想教育正在开展的时候，纪念这一节日，并从中受到一次马克思列宁主义和社会主义的教育，是具有重大政治意义的。共青团、青联、学联的各级组织，应当重视这一工作，按照中国人民庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年筹备委员会所作的各项决定，积极地动员与组织青、少年参加各项庆祝活动。
    二、在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的各种活动中，应当努力使青年了解以下几点：
    （一）苏联在十月革命胜利以后，四十年来在各方面所取得的伟大成就，表明社会主义制度比之资本主义制度有着不可比拟的优越性。我国青年应当更加坚定不移地走社会主义道路。
    （二）我国今天的阶级斗争并未熄灭，国内外敌人和资产阶级右派还时刻企图复辟资本主义，因此，必须巩固无产阶级专政，坚决争取我国政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的彻底胜利，粉碎资产阶级右派反苏、反共、反社会主义、反马克思列宁主义的各种谬论，为保卫十月革命的道路而斗争。

    全国民主妇联的通知
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年即将到来。全国人民代表大会常务委员会和全国政治协商会议常务委员会联席会议已根据中国共产党中央委员会的建议，成立了中国人民庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年筹备委员会，并通过决议号召全国各界人民庄严和隆重地庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年。我们全国各级妇联组织要热烈响应这个号召，在当地党委领导下，根据妇女的觉悟水平，密切结合目前全国正在进行的社会主义思想教育工作，广泛地向全国妇女宣传十月社会主义革命对开辟全世界人类解放的道路的伟大意义，宣传中苏两国人民的团结与友谊是促进我国社会主义建设的重要条件，是世界和平的重要保障。要号召全国妇女树立坚定不移地跟着共产党走社会主义道路的决心，学习苏联妇女勤俭建国、勤俭持家的光辉榜样，并为增进中苏两国人民伟大的牢不可破的团结与友谊作出贡献。我们各级妇联组织，应根据人大、政协常委会联席会议关于庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年决议的精神，建议有关各方面在男女人民中一齐进行宣传教育，而各级妇联本身，并应在妇女群众中进行加工的宣传教育。加工的宣传教育内容，主要有下列三点：
    1、宣传伟大的十月社会主义革命照亮了全世界妇女解放的道路。十月社会主义革命首先使苏联妇女永远摆脱了被压迫被剥削被奴役的地位，成为政治上、经济上、文化上、社会上和家庭生活中都有充分平等权利的主人。四十年来，苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，保卫和发展了十月社会主义革命的成果，在社会主义建设方面获得了伟大的胜利，苏联妇女和苏联人民一道过着美好幸福的生活，并为儿童创造了健康成长的优越条件。苏联妇女各方面生活和地位的提高，有力地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。我国妇女在中国共产党领导下，循着十月社会主义革命所开辟的光荣道路，以苏联妇女为榜样，英勇地参加了中国人民革命斗争，并和全国人民一起，取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。今后，我们一定还要继续学习苏联妇女，坚决地维护和巩固社会主义制度，进一步提高社会主义觉悟，为争取我国政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的彻底胜利而奋斗。
    2、要学习苏联妇女勤俭建国、勤俭持家的光辉榜样。苏联是伟大的社会主义国家，苏联人民今天的幸福生活是他们经过艰苦奋斗、辛勤劳动，克服了种种困难获得的。在任何艰苦困难的年月里或工作岗位上，苏联妇女都是和男子并肩为祖国、为社会主义建设作出了巨大的贡献。苏联妇女勤俭建国和克服困难掌握科学文化技术知识的榜样，是永远值得我们学习的。苏联妇女不但是国家建设战线上的积极分子，也是勤俭持家的能手。她们把勤俭持家看成是个人与家庭富裕生活的一种重要保障，是发展社会主义国家建设事业的一个重要方面，也是社会主义家庭的一种美德。因此，她们以对国家负责的态度，克勤克俭的操持家务，精打细算，合理安排劳动、学习、休息的时间和计划家庭开支、厉行节约和注意储蓄。并且还以身作则教育子女成为热爱社会主义、热爱劳动、艰苦朴素、身体健康的共产主义建设的接班人。
    苏联妇女的英雄事迹曾经在鼓舞我国妇女勇敢积极地参加革命斗争和建设事业方面产生了巨大的作用。现在当我国的社会主义改造已基本完成，还要进一步巩固并发展社会主义建设事业的时候，我们更要继续学习苏联妇女艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国、勤俭持家的美德，为我们的伟大社会主义建设事业作出更大的贡献。
    3、宣传中苏两国人民和妇女伟大的牢不可破的团结与友谊。苏联是保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒，她对保卫世界和平和促进人类进步事业作了伟大的贡献。在过去和现在，苏联政府和人民给予我国社会主义建设的全面的、无私的援助，是我国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展不可缺少的重要条件之一。在帮助我国人民学习先进的科学技术上，苏联专家重视对我国妇女的培养与帮助，更是我们永远不忘的。我们全国妇女要像保护自己的眼珠一样保护中苏友谊，不断地为巩固和发展中苏人民这种深厚的牢不可破的伟大友谊而努力。
    希望各级妇联组织在当地党委统一领导下，根据总的计划，提出向妇女加工的具体宣传计划。协助有关方面贯彻执行男女一齐发动的方针，尽量组织妇女群众参加当地举办的庆祝十月革命四十周年的各种集会、展览会、文化艺术表演等活动。同时妇联可根据需要与可能单独举办各种适合妇女群众的报告会、座谈会等。各级妇联自办的妇女刊物，以及与有关单位合办的妇女副刊，都要根据上述宣传要点有计划地做好十月社会主义革命四十周年的宣传工作。城市妇联组织还可配合当地邮局在女职工、知识妇女及家庭妇女中宣传推广“苏联妇女”杂志并征集订户，以便使更多的妇女能通过这个杂志经常地更具体地向苏联妇女学习。
    民建中央和工商联的指示
    民建会各省工作委员会，各市委员会（筹委会），各城市支部（小组）；各省、自治区、直辖市工商业联合会：
    伟大的十月社会主义革命节即将到来，中国人民代表大会常务委员会、中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会联席会议，号召全国各界人民，庄严而隆重地庆祝这个伟大的节日。我们两会——中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会完全拥护这一号召，要求各级组织积极推动工商业者参加伟大的十月社会主义革命节四十周年的庆祝活动。为此，特作如下指示：
    一、各级民建会、工商联组织应把纪念十月社会主义革命四十周年和当前工商界全面整风的宣传教育工作结合起来，向工商业者深入宣传，帮助广大工商业者认识十月革命的伟大意义，及其对包括中国革命在内的全人类解放事业的深远影响；四十年来苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下在社会主义建设方面的伟大成就，对世界和平的巨大贡献，以及对新中国建设事业的真诚无私的援助等。要通过这些纪念活动，使工商业者不是在口头上而是在思想上认识到社会主义制度的优越性，中苏两国友好合作的巨大意义，以及右派分子反党反社会主义、诬蔑苏联、反对向苏联学习和挑拨中苏关系等一切罪恶阴谋的危害性，从而提高对右派分子的斗争意志和增强改造政治立场的决心。
    二、关于庆祝活动的具体组织工作方面，各级民建会、工商联组织应当：
    （一）在当地中共党委，政协和中苏友好协会的统一计划下，积极参加庆祝活动的筹备工作。
    （二）有计划地组织民建会员和工商业者积极参加在节日或节日前夕当地的庆祝大会。
    （三）除组织工商业者积极参加当地统一举办的纪念十月革命的报告会、展览会和文化活动外，还可推动工商业者学习纪念社会主义革命四十周年的有关文件，并另行举办专门对工商业者的报告会，邀请党政负责同志结合工商界的具体情况作报告，并将报告内容层层下达，做到家喻户晓，使广大工商业者受到一次社会主义思想教育。
    各地的两会组织应密切合作，并在当地党政领导下同有关方面配合，做好各项庆祝活动和宣传教育工作。
