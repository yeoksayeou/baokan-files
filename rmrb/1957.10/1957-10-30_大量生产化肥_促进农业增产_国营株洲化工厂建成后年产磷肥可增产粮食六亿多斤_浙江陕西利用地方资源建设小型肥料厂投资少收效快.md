Xinhua News Agency report: A modern factory for producing pesticides and chemical fertilizers – the State-Owned Zhuzhou Chemical Plant – has begun construction.

The Zhuzhou Chemical Plant is a semi-automated factory. Once completed, the plant will produce phosphate fertilizer, “666” crude powder, as well as sulfuric acid, caustic soda, liquid chlorine, hydrochloric acid, bleaching powder and other products. In the future, when conditions permit, there are also plans to produce 2,4,5-T (a herbicide that can eliminate weeds and help crops grow) and pentachlorophenol (a pesticide).

After this factory is completed, the phosphate fertilizer produced each year can increase grain production by over 600 million jin.

This newspaper reports: Zhejiang Province is actively building chemical fertilizer factories to support agricultural production.

Since last year, many granular fertilizer plants built in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Ningbo and other places have been completed and put into production. This year, many chemical fertilizer factories have been newly built and expanded. Quzhou is preparing to build a calcium cyanamide fertilizer plant, a phosphate fertilizer plant, a potassium-nitrogen mixed fertilizer plant, and the Zhejiang Chemical Plant. After these factories are completed, Quzhou will become one of China's chemical industrial bases, producing large quantities of chemical fertilizers and industrial raw materials each year.

During the expansion and construction of these factories, all localities have paid attention to fully utilizing local resources. In the coastal salt areas of eastern Zhejiang, there are large quantities of bittern byproducts, which were mostly poured into the sea in the past. This year, the state built a new Zhejiang Eastern Chemical Plant in Cixi, using bittern to produce magnesium sulfate, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide and more than ten kinds of chemical fertilizers and chemical industrial raw materials.

Xinhua News Agency report: The Shaanxi Province local industrial departments plan to build and expand six small-scale fertilizer plants (mines) and one pilot-scale bacterial fertilizer workshop next year, to vigorously support agricultural production.

Shaanxi Province has rich peat and phosphate mineral deposits, which are good farmland fertilizers. In order to vigorously support agricultural production, the Provincial Department of Industry has decided to build a phosphate mine with an annual output of 10,000 tons in Nanzheng County next year, and to build two peat plants in Hengshan and Yulin counties in northern Shaanxi with a total annual output of 10,000 tons, to produce fertilizer for farmers in the mountainous areas of northern and southern Shaanxi. In order to expand bone meal production, two small bone meal plants with an annual output of 150 tons each will be built in Jingbian and Shenmu counties in northern Shaanxi. The existing bone meal plant in Xi'an City with an annual output of 2,500 tons will also be expanded, and the output after the expansion will be doubled compared to the present. The Provincial Department of Industry has also decided to build a pilot-scale bacterial fertilizer workshop with an annual output of 300 jin of rhizobia and azotobacter. If the trial-produced bacterial fertilizer has good fertilizer effect, it will be expanded in the future. These newly built fertilizer plants (mines) are all small in scale, low in investment, and quick to build, and will all be put into production next year. (Attached picture)

    大量生产化肥　促进农业增产
    国营株洲化工厂建成后年产磷肥可增产粮食六亿多斤
    浙江陕西利用地方资源建设小型肥料厂投资少收效快
    据新华社讯　一座现代化的生产农药、化学肥料的工厂——国营株洲化工厂已经开始动工兴建。
    株洲化工厂是一个半自动化的工厂。全厂建成以后，将生产磷肥、“666”原粉以及硫酸、烧碱、液氯、盐酸、漂白粉等多种产品。将来条件具备以后，还计划生产2·4·5T（是一种除草剂，它能消灭杂草又能帮助农作物生长）及五氯酚（农药）。
    这个工厂建成以后，每年生产的磷肥，就可以增产粮食六亿多斤。
    本报讯　浙江省积极兴建化学肥料工厂，支援农业生产。
    从去年以来，在杭州、嘉兴、温州、宁波等地兴建的许多颗粒肥料厂已经先后建成投入生产。今年又新建和扩建了许多化学肥料工厂。衢州正在筹建石灰氮肥厂、磷肥厂、钾氮混合肥料厂和浙江化工厂。这些工厂建成以后，将使衢州成为我国的化学工业基地之一，每年可以生产大量的化学肥料和工业原料。
    在扩建和新建这些工厂时，各地都注意了充分利用地方资源。在浙东盐区，有大批副产品苦卤，过去大都倒到海里。今年，国家在慈溪新建了一座浙东化工厂，利用苦卤生产硫酸镁、氧化钙、氧化镁等十多种化学肥料和化学工业原料。

    据新华社讯　陕西省地方工业部门计划明年新建和扩建六座小型肥料厂（矿）和一个试制性的细菌肥料车间，大力支援农业生产。
    陕西省地下埋有丰富的泥炭和磷肥矿藏，是良好的农田肥料。省工业厅为了大力支援农业生产，决定明年在南郑县建立一座年产一万吨的磷肥矿，在陕北的横山、榆林两县建立二座年产共一万吨的泥炭厂，生产供应陕北和陕南山区农民用肥。为了扩大骨粉生产，将在陕北的靖边、神木两县建立两座年产骨粉各一百五十吨的小型骨粉厂。西安市原有的一座年产二千五百吨的骨粉厂也要进行扩建，扩建后的产量将比现在增加一倍。省工业厅还决定建设一座试验性的细菌肥料车间，年产三百斤根瘤菌和固氮菌，如果试制的细菌肥料肥效良好，将来再进行扩建。这些新建的肥料厂（矿），都是规模小，投资少，建设快，明年就可以全部投入生产。（附图片）
