Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th -- Jiangsu's cotton-producing areas are constantly reporting bumper cotton harvests. Members of agricultural cooperatives are happily picking new cotton, selling it batch by batch, to support the country's socialist construction.

This year, Jiangsu Province's cotton production is expected to reach four million dan, an increase of 53.8% over last year.

The more than ten million mu of cotton fields in Jiangsu Province are currently full of bolls, gradually opening up. Although the cotton field area in the main cotton-producing area of Nantong Prefecture is 90,000 mu less than last year, the total output will increase by more than 700,000 dan of ginned cotton compared to last year. This year, the yield per unit area of the 3.76 million mu of cotton in this prefecture can approach that of the bumper harvest year of 1955, with an average yield of more than 46 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Not only can the 1.52 million mu of cotton in Songjiang Prefecture increase production by more than 50% compared to last year, but it is also expected to exceed the level of the bumper harvest year of 1955. The yield per unit area of the entire prefecture can reach more than 60 jin of ginned cotton. The 1.35 million mu of cotton fields in the Xuhuai new cotton area have also generally reported bumper harvests. The yield per unit area of cotton in Huaiyin Prefecture will jump from 17.4 jin in 1955 to about 25 jin.

Due to late sowing, uneven rainfall, and low temperatures during the growing season, cotton in some areas tended to develop later than in previous years. Local agricultural cooperatives began to do everything possible last month to strengthen the later-stage cultivation and pest control of cotton fields, actively pruning and spraying phosphorus, dredging drainage ditches in the fields, promoting early boll opening, reducing frost-damaged flowers, and striving for a bumper harvest.

    江苏棉花丰收
    新华社南京9日电　不断传出棉花丰收消息的江苏省棉产区，农业社社员们正在喜摘新棉，摘一批卖一批，支援国家的社会主义建设。
    今年江苏省的棉花产量预计可以达到四百万担，比去年增产53.8％。
    江苏省今年种植的一千多万亩棉田目前正是结桃累累，陆续吐絮。主要棉区南通专区的棉田面积虽然比去年少九万亩，但是总产量将比去年增加七十多万担皮棉。今年，这个专区三百七十六万亩棉花单位面积产量可以接近丰收的1955年，平均每亩可以收皮棉四十六斤以上。松江专区一百五十二万亩棉花不仅可以比去年增产50％以上，而且可望超过丰产的1955年水平，全专区单位面积产量可以达到六十斤皮棉以上。徐淮新棉区一百三十五万亩棉田也普告丰收。淮阴专区棉花单位面积产量将从1955年的一十七点四斤跃进到二十五斤左右。
    部分地区棉花由于播种较迟，雨水不匀，生长期间气温较低，有比往年迟发的趋势。当地农业社在上月就开始想尽一切办法加强棉田后期培植和后期治虫工作，积极整枝喷磷，疏通田间排水沟，促进棉桃及早吐絮，减少霜后花，争取丰产丰收。
