    The Workshop Director Must Also Manage Ideology
    Lin Hongxuan, director of the Second Workshop,
    He is meticulous in his work and takes hardship first.
    He grasps the plan very firmly,
    Reducing costs by countless yuan.
    Director Lin focuses solely on production,
    Forgetting the disagreements between the business groups.
    Managing business also requires managing ideology,
    A two-pronged approach is the only way to achieve perfection.

    车间主任也要管思想
    二车间主任林洪轩，
    他工作细心苦在先。
    计划掌握得很牢靠，
    成本降低无数元。
    林主任一心搞生产，
    忘了业务组之间闹意见。
    管业务也得管思想，
    双管齐下才圆满。
