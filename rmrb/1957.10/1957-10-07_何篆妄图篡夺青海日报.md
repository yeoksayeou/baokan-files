In the Anti-Rightist Front

    He Zhuan Schemed to Usurp Qinghai Daily
    The Qinghai Daily has exposed He Zhuan, a rightist element who was deeply hidden behind the scenes and gave commands.
    He Zhuan was an editor at the Qinghai Daily. In order to realize his conspiracy to enter the newspaper's editorial board and alter the political direction of the Qinghai Daily, he commanded some rightist elements behind the scenes to launch a狂妄 (wild) attack on the Communist Party. He first incited those within the newspaper who had been investigated during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and were now trying to overturn their cases, saying, "The follow-up work of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the newspaper office was not done well. In the past, the Communist Party wrongly criticized people. In order to prove that slapping you once was not wrong, they will slap you a second time." They completely negated the past achievements of the newspaper and the leadership of the editorial board. He slandered the members of the editorial board as being unqualified. He proposed "expanding the editorial board," vainly hoping to participate in it himself. When the anti-rightist struggle began, the disguise of this behind-the-scenes mastermind was completely exposed. He Zhuan's anti-Communist and anti-people stance has historical roots.
    Before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, He Zhuan served the Japanese and Wang Jingwei at the "Juelu Ballroom" in Shanghai, frequently interacting with Japanese military police, ronin, traitors, and secret agents. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he transformed himself into a journalist for the "Heping Daily," the newspaper of the puppet military commission. After liberation, he infiltrated the revolutionary ranks.

    何篆妄图篡夺青海日报
    青海日报社已经把深藏在幕后指挥的右派分子何篆揭露出来。
    何篆是青海日报的编辑。他为了实现进入报社编委会，篡改青海日报政治方向的阴谋，在幕后指挥着一些右派分子向共产党狂妄进攻。他首先煽动报社内在肃反中被审查过现在企图翻案的人，说“报社肃反的善后工作做得不好，以前共产党错打了人，为了证明他打一个嘴巴没有打错，他还要打你第二个嘴巴。”他们对以往报纸的成绩及编委会的领导全盘否定，他诬蔑编委会的成员都不称职。他提议“应扩大编委会。”妄想自己也参加进去。反右派斗争开始，他这个幕后主谋者的伪装完全被揭开了。何篆的反共反人民是有其历史根源的。
    抗日战争胜利以前，何篆在上海“爵禄舞厅”为日、汪服务，同日本宪兵、浪人、汉奸、特务往来频繁。抗日战争结束后，他摇身一变当了伪军事委员会机关报“和平日报”的记者。解放后混入了革命队伍。
