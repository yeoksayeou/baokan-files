Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, October 27th: To date, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has transferred over 8,000 cadres of various ethnic groups to the grassroots and back to their hometowns to participate in production.

A group of cadres with good ideological style and a certain level of policy theory have strengthened leadership after being transferred to the grassroots. Among the cadres transferred from autonomous region-level organizations, there are 9 department-level cadres and 45 division-level cadres. They have respectively served as secretaries of the league (prefecture) committees, county (banner) committees, factory party committees, heads of counties (banners), and factory directors and pasture directors. Among the 2,200 cadres transferred from four leagues including Jerim, and Ulanqab, there are 66 banner/county-level cadres and more than 1,600 district/section-level cadres. Among them, 70% hold major leadership positions in districts, townships (sumu). According to statistics from Junwang Banner in the Ik Zhao League, 95% of the transferred cadres participated in labor production alongside the masses. Yao Lingge, secretary of the Ningcheng County Party Committee (formerly deputy director of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the People's Bank of China), spent a month working in the countryside during his first two months in office and often participated in physical labor with the masses, which was well received by the masses.

A portion of the cadres have returned to their hometowns and factories to participate in labor production. According to incomplete statistics from organizations directly under the Autonomous Region, Hulunbuir League, and Hohhot City, more than 2,300 people have now participated in production, most of whom have joined agricultural cooperatives. In some areas, because some cadres had close ties with the masses in the past, the masses specifically requested them to return to work in the agricultural cooperatives. For example, in Naiman Banner, the masses specifically requested the return of 58 cadres to the agricultural cooperatives, accounting for 34.8% of the cadres who returned to their hometowns to participate in production in this banner. A deputy township head surnamed Gao in a ethnic township in Tongliao County picked up a large hoe and took the lead in collecting manure the day after returning to the commune. The commune members praised him, saying, "Well done, he deserves to be a Communist Party member, he can do anything!".

Currently, relevant departments in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are continuing to streamline organizations, transfer cadres, and mobilize cadres to return to their hometowns to participate in production. They are also conducting education for cadres on the glory of labor and maintaining close ties with the people, and are preparing to transfer another group of cadres this winter and spring so that they can rush to their glorious posts before the spring ploughing and production next year, to further serve the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia.

    加强基层领导　还乡参加生产
    内蒙古下放各族干部八千多名
    新华社呼和浩特27日电　到目前为止，内蒙古自治区已经有八千多名各民族干部下放到基层和还乡生产。
    一批思想作风较好、有一定政策理论水平的干部，下放到基层后加强了领导。自治区一级机关下放干部中就有厅长级干部九人，处长级干部四十五人，他们分别担任了地（盟）委书记、县（旗）委、工厂党委书记、旗县长和工厂厂长、牧场场长。哲里木、乌兰察布等四个盟下放的二千二百名干部中，有旗县级干部六十六人，区、科长级干部一千六百多人。其中70％到基层担任区、乡（苏木）的主要领导职务。据伊克昭盟郡王旗统计，下放干部中有95％的人和群众一起参加了劳动生产。中共宁城县委书记姚林阁（原中国人民银行内蒙分行副行长）在到任的两个月工作中就下乡工作一个月，而且经常同群众一起参加体力劳动，群众的反映很好。
    有一部分干部回乡、下厂参加了劳动生产。据自治区直属机关、呼伦贝尔等盟和呼和浩特市的不完全统计，现已有二千三百多人参加了生产，其中绝大部分参加了农业社的生产。有的地区由于有些干部和群众过去联系密切，群众指名要他们回到农业社工作，如奈曼旗群众指名要回农业社的干部就有五十八名，占这个旗还乡生产干部的34.8％。通辽县民族乡的一个姓高的副乡长，回社的第二天就拿起大镐带头起粪。社员赞扬他说“好样的，不亏是个共产党员，干啥都行！”。
    目前，内蒙古自治区有关部门正在继续紧缩机构、下放干部和动员干部还乡生产，并且向干部进行劳动光荣和密切联系人民群众的教育，准备在今冬明春再下放一批干部，以便他们在明年春耕生产前能奔赴自己的光荣岗位，更进一步为内蒙古各族人民服务。
