Xinhua News Agency report: Shanghai's thirty-two state-owned commercial specialized companies are actively improving their business management during the rectification movement. Of the more than 20,000 criticisms and suggestions from employees regarding business management, over 1,000 have already been resolved, over 3,000 are being processed, and the remainder are being actively studied.

    Regarding the issues of institutional setup and personnel allocation, the Vegetable Company, based on the current business situation, abolished four pickle wholesale departments and one vegetable wholesale department, transferring personnel to support district stores and pickle processing plants that lacked manpower, to improve their operating level. The Food and Sundries Company, based on employee feedback, changed the original purchasing and sales groups into pickle and dried vegetable groups, based on the commodities they managed. In the past, the connection between purchasing and sales was not close enough, and when goods were overstocked or out of stock, they blamed each other. Now, both groups implement a unified purchase and sales system. In the past two months, there have been no instances of artificial overstocking or out-of-stock situations. The employees of the two groups are united and consult with each other on all matters.

    Many commodity management problems have also been resolved during the rectification movement. Employees of the Clothing Company criticized the leadership for being greedy and ambitious when purchasing Hailisi wool fabric, and then being conservative and reluctant to sell when the market needed it, causing 36,000 meters of Hailisi wool fabric to be overstocked in the warehouse for half a year, affecting the turnover of state funds. The company leadership accepted the criticism and has already transferred 23,000 meters to the stores, organized sales, and stipulated that in the future, the business department's purchasing plan must be reviewed by the finance department, and the finance department will also inspect and supervise the implementation process, to ensure both supply and avoid overstocking. The Department Store Company had an overstock of more than 400,000 razor blades, some of which had rusted. Employees had previously suggested selling them at a reduced price, but the leadership did not pay attention. This time, during the rectification movement, someone raised this issue again, and the company leadership has adopted it. Some units have improved processing and purchasing work based on employee feedback, making commodities more suitable for consumer needs.

    简化机构  改进管理
    据新华社讯　上海市三十二个国营商业专业公司在整风运动中积极改进企业的经营管理。职工们提出的两万多条有关经营管理的批评和意见，目前已经有一千多条解决，有三千多条正在处理，其余的也正在加紧研究。
    在机构设置和人员配备问题上，蔬菜公司根据目前业务情况，撤销了四个酱菜批发部和一个蔬菜批发部，抽出人员支援人手缺乏的区店和酱菜加工场，提高它们的经营水平。食品杂货公司根据职工意见，把原来的进货组和销货组按经营商品改为酱菜组和干菜组。过去进、销双方联系不够密切，遇到商品积压或脱销时，彼此抱怨。现在两个组都实行进销合一的工作制度，两个月来没有发生过人为的商品积压或脱销现象，两个组的职工团结无间，遇事便相互商量。
    许多商品经营上的问题在整风运动中也获得了解决。服装公司职工批评领导方面购进海力斯呢时贪多图大，市场需要时又保守惜售，使三万六千公尺海力斯呢在仓库里积压半年之久，影响了国家资金周转。公司领导方面接受批评，已经把两万三千公尺调到商店，组织推销，并且规定今后业务科的进货计划必须经过财务科审查，执行过程中也由财务科检查督促，以做到既保证供应，又避免积压。百货公司积压剃须刀片四十多万片，部分已经生锈，职工们以前建议降价出售时，领导方面没有引起重视。这次整风运动中又有人提出这个意见，公司领导方面已经加以采纳。有些单位根据职工意见改进了加工、采购工作，使商品更加适合消费者需要。
