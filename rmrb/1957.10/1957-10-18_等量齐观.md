    “Treating Everything Equally”
    A leading comrade, after seeing the criticisms directed at him, said: “Why do you draw so many cartoons of me? Write so many big-character posters about me? So sharp? Why don't you write and draw the same way about other leading cadres? It’s really unfair.” In fact, the big-character posters are directed at different situations and different shortcomings of each leader. Some are mentioned less, some are mentioned more, some are mentioned lightly, some are mentioned more sharply. This is not strange at all. How can you demand that the big-character posters treat everything equally? Some say that this is still a manifestation of not being modest.
    The masses are fair, and the unfair one is precisely the person who says such things.

    “等量齐观”
    有一位领导同志看到对他的批评以后说：“你们为什么画我这多漫画？写我这多大字报？这样尖锐？为什么不对其他领导干部一样的写、画？真是太不公平了”。其实，大字报是针对各个领导人不同的情况和不同的缺点，有的提得少，有的提得多，有的提得轻些，有的提得尖锐些，这是一点也不奇怪的，怎么能要求大字报等量齐观呢？有人说，这还是不虚心的一种表现。
    群众是公平的，而不公平的恰恰是说这种话的人自己。
