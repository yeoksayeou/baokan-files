　　All-China Handicraft Cooperative and Three Other Units Issue Notice
    Warmly Celebrate the October Revolution Anniversary
    (Our report) The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies, and the General Association of the Chinese Medical Association have each issued notices and instructions to their local organizations, requiring them, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, to actively carry out various activities to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Through these activities, socialist education should be conducted, and the rightists' slanderous statements against learning from the Soviet Union should be given a powerful blow.
    The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative, in its notice, proposed to publicize the great significance of the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to our country's socialist construction.
    The Chinese Medical Association, in its instructions to local branches on celebrating the October Revolution Anniversary, also specifically pointed out that it is necessary to learn from the Soviet medical scientists' spirit of serving the people with utmost dedication, so that our country's medical work can play a better role.
