　　Strive for the Early Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations
　　By Our Editorial Staff
    The Chinese people's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the delegation of the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations jointly issued a joint statement on the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations on October 10. This joint statement once again expressed the sincere desire of the people of China and Japan to restore normal relations between the two countries, and further strengthened the friendship between the two peoples.
    In the past few years, the contacts between the people of China and Japan have become increasingly frequent, and non-governmental organizations of the two countries have signed more than a dozen agreements, most of which have been effectively implemented. Before the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the two governments, such rapid development of friendly exchanges between the people of the two countries is rare in modern international relations. This has played a significant role in enhancing the friendship and understanding between the two peoples and promoting economic and cultural exchanges; it undoubtedly has great significance in promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.
    The Chinese people hope to restore diplomatic relations with Japan as soon as possible. Because the normalization of relations between the two countries is not only conducive to further developing and expanding economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries, and conducive to the common prosperity of the two countries, but also conducive to peace in Asia and the world. We understand that the Japanese people share the same desire with us. The establishment of the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, its name itself and its broad representation, illustrate this point. We also know that the Japanese people, like us, have made many efforts to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. However, until today, the reason why the wishes of the people of the two countries have still not been realized and diplomatic relations have not been restored to normal is, as the joint statement points out, because there are "forces from outside the two countries and their followers" hindering the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. This "force from outside the two countries" is the United States. The United States does not want Sino-Japanese relations to return to normal because it fears that in this way, it will lose the opportunity to create tension in the Far East, and lose the excuse to continue to control Japan and turn Japan into its war base. At the same time, there are some pro-American factions in Japan who, for their own interests, violate the wishes of the Japanese people and the interests of the nation, and play the inglorious role of followers of the United States in obstructing the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan.
    The United States' occupation of our Taiwan is a major threat to peace in Asia and a manifestation of the United States' hostility towards 600 million Chinese people. The United States' use of the Taiwan Kuomintang group to usurp the seat in the United Nations and obstruct the Chinese people from restoring their representation in the United Nations is also in order to create tension in Asia. Some people in Japan believe that the Taiwan issue has cast a shadow over the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, which is incorrect. The problem is that the current Japanese government has adopted a compliant attitude towards the interference of the United States, rather than adopting a friendly policy towards the Chinese people in accordance with the will of the Japanese people. The delegation of the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, through a joint statement, expressed a clear position on the Taiwan issue, believing that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and the national movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations "should not be exploited by any conspiracy to create two Chinas"; and believes that the Chinese people's right to representation in the United Nations should be quickly restored through the cooperation of Asian and African countries. This undoubtedly reflects the position of the broad masses of the Japanese people.
    The Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations is a very broadly representative organization. We are pleased to see that not only prominent figures from all walks of life in Japan and representatives of opposition parties participate, but also representatives of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party participate. This shows that within the ruling party in Japan, there are also more and more people who wisely recognize the importance of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and are contributing their strength to its realization. At the same time, the world has entered the era of intercontinental missiles and man-made satellites, and we must avoid devastating wars. Regardless of the social system or political beliefs, mankind must coexist peacefully. Under such circumstances, the United States' continued pursuit of its Cold War or preparations for hot war policies will inevitably encounter greater and greater difficulties; if the Japanese government continues to follow the United States' policies, it will inevitably encounter greater and greater dissatisfaction from the Japanese people.
    We have every reason to believe that although there are still many difficulties on the road to normalizing Sino-Japanese relations, the possibility of removing obstacles and striving for the early restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is increasing. We hope that this day will come soon, and are willing to continue to make unremitting efforts to strengthen friendly relations with the Japanese people.

　　争取早日恢复中日邦交
　　本报评论员
    中国人民外交学会和日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华使节团，在10月10日联合发表了关于恢复中日邦交的共同声明。这个共同声明又一次表达了中日两国人民要求恢复两国正常关系的真诚愿望，并进一步加强了两国人民之间的友谊。
    几年来，中日两国人民的接触日益频繁，两国的民间团体已经签订了十几个协定，而且大多数都能有效地实施。在两国政府建立正常外交关系以前，两国人民之间友好交往能够这样迅速地发展，在现代国际关系中是少见的。这对于增进两国人民的友谊和了解，促进经济、文化的交流，曾经起了很大的作用；对于促进中日关系的正常化，无疑地也具有重大的意义。
    中国人民是希望和日本早日恢复邦交的。因为两国关系的正常化，不仅有利于进一步发展和扩大两国间的经济、文化合作，有利于两国的共同繁荣，而且也有利于亚洲和世界的和平。我们了解，日本人民是同我们具有同样的愿望的。日本恢复日中邦交国民会议的成立，它的名称本身和它的广泛的代表性，就说明了这一点。我们也知道，日本人民同我们一样，曾为促进中日关系的正常化作了不少努力。但是，直到今天，两国人民的愿望之所以仍然不能实现，邦交之所以仍然不能恢复正常，正如共同声明所指出的，是因为有“来自两国以外的势力和它的追随者”在阻碍着中日邦交的恢复。这种“来自两国以外的势力”就是美国。美国不希望中日关系恢复正常，是因为它害怕这样一来，就会失掉在远东制造紧张局势的机会，失掉继续控制日本、把日本变成它的战争基地的借口。同时在日本国内有一部分亲美派，它们为了自己的利益，却违反了日本人民的愿望和民族的利益，充当了美国阻挠中日两国恢复正常关系的追随者的不光荣的角色。
    美国侵占我国台湾，是对亚洲和平的重大威胁，是美国敌视六亿中国人民的表现。美国利用台湾国民党集团窃据联合国席位，阻挠中国人民恢复在联合国的代表权，同样是为了要在亚洲制造紧张局势。日本有些人士认为，台湾问题为日中邦交的恢复投下了阴影，这是不对的。问题是在日本现政府对美国的干涉采取了顺从的态度，而不是顺应日本人民的意志对中国人民采取友好的政策。日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华使节团，通过共同声明，在台湾问题上表示了明确的立场，认为台湾问题是中国的内政问题，恢复日中邦交的国民运动，“不应该被任何制造两个中国的阴谋所利用”；并认为中国人民在联合国的代表权，应通过亚非各国的合作得到迅速恢复。这无疑地反映了日本广大人民的立场。
    日本恢复日中邦交国民会议是一个代表性非常广泛的组织。我们高兴地看到，其中不仅有日本各界著名人士、在野党派的代表参加，而且也有执政党自由民主党的代表参加。这说明在日本执政党内也有越来越多的人，明智地认识到恢复中日邦交的重要意义，并且在为其实现贡献他们的力量。同时，世界已进入洲际导弹和人造卫星时代，我们必须避免毁灭性的战争。不管社会制度如何，政治信仰如何，人类必须和平共处下去。在这种情况下，美国继续推行它的冷战或准备热战的政策，必将碰到越来越大的困难；日本政府如果继续追随美国这样的政策，也必将遭到日本人民越来越大的不满。
    我们完全有理由相信，尽管恢复中日关系正常化的道路上困难仍多，扫除障碍、争取早日恢复中日邦交的可能性是越来越大了。我们希望这一天早日到来，并愿意继续为加强和日本人民之间的友好关系而努力不懈。
