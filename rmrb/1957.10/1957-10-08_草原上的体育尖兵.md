The Mongolian people, who live on the northern grasslands of our motherland, have developed a habit of loving sports and exercising from an early age.

Since liberation, Inner Mongolia has not only seen the emergence of a large number of wrestling, archery, and horsemanship experts, but also track and field and ball games have been developed among ethnic minorities. Even basketball teams have appeared in Lama temples. Yitaoge, a former poor Mongolian herdsman and now a first-class athlete, became famous throughout the country as early as the 1953 National Track and Field Games. He is currently a track and field instructor at the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Competitive Sports Guidance Section.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region delegation participating in the National Track and Field Games has a total of twenty-eight male and female athletes, including Mongolians, Manchus, and Han Chinese. Some of them come from the great forest area of ​​Tuli River in the Xing'an Mountains, and some grow up in the Ikezhao League in the westernmost part of Inner Mongolia. Two members of the delegation are participating in Group A competitions. Among them, Liu Zheng, a member of the national track and field team and a master of sports, is the national record holder for the women's 80-meter hurdles. Mongolian college student Seyin Bayar also has good results in the 10-kilometer race walk. Manchu athlete Zhao Guiru will participate in the women's pentathlon.
