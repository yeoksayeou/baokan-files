Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 14th: Since Qingdao State-Owned No. 2 Cotton Mill approved the transfer of eighty-four cadres to workshops to participate in production in June and July, it has achieved good results.

This factory has three flat car teams in weaving maintenance, originally with four foremen, which was a case of too many people and too few jobs. The flat car teams, on the other hand, were unable to complete their production plans due to the removal of production backbones. After the transfer of three experienced foremen to the three flat car teams as team leaders in June, they have completed 100% of their production plans every month, with good quality. Wang Xinyuan, the former captain of the second flat car team, who was promoted to foreman last September, had excellent skills and was a production backbone. This time, he returned to his original team as the captain, turning the team from failing to meet the plan every month to completing the production plan for three consecutive months and receiving awards, becoming the factory's top-notch flat car team. The workers also reflected: "We have a master to learn techniques from now." Zhao Yongpu (a university student who entered the factory in 1955), who remained as foreman, although his work was more intense than before, was also very happy.

Among the transferred cadres, fifty-five went to the tire cord fabric workshop, ensuring the workers needed after the workshop's expansion. After three months of training, they officially participated in production in early October.

The cadres transferred by this factory in June and July accounted for 13.77% of the total number of administrative and Party mass cadres in the factory. After they participated in production, they not only increased the backbone force in production, creating more wealth for the country, but also saved the enterprise's management costs.

　　青岛国棉二厂抽调干部当工人
    增加了生产骨干节省了管理费用
    据新华社青岛14日电　国营青岛第二棉纺织厂在6、7月份先后批准八十四名干部到车间参加生产以后，已经收到良好效果。
    这个工厂在织布保全方面共有三个平车队，原有四个工长，人多事少；平车队则因抽走了生产骨干而完不成生产计划。从6月份将三个有实际经验的工长下放到三个平车队担任队长以后，月月都百分之百地完成生产计划，质量还很好。去年9月提拔为工长的原第二平车队队长王信元，技术很好，是生产中的骨干，这次回到原队担任原职，使这个平车队由原来月月完不成计划转为连续三个月完成生产计划而受到奖励，成为全厂第一流的平车队。工人们也反映：学技术有师傅了。留下的工长赵永朴（1955年进厂的大学生），工作虽然较前紧张了些，也是很愉快的。
    下放的干部中，有五十五名到帘子布车间，保证了这个车间扩建以后所需要的工人。经过三个月的培训，他们在10月初正式参加了生产。
    这个工厂在6、7月份下放的干部占全厂行政管理干部和党群干部总数的13.77％。他们参加生产以后，不仅增加了生产中的骨干力量，为国家多创造了财富，而且也节省了企业的管理费用。
