    This newspaper reports: The Daxiang First Cooperative in Gaoshan Township, Changsha County, Hunan Province, has swiftly improved its work during the socialist great debate. This has not only powerfully promoted current production but has also further dispelled the concerns of its members, encouraging them to speak out freely.

    This cooperative began its socialist great debate in early September. Some members raised opinions on the cooperative's management and the relationship between urban and rural areas. However, some members still had reservations, fearing that their opinions would not be addressed. In light of this situation, the cooperative's Party branch and management committee immediately improved upon the shortcomings in their work that members had already pointed out. For example, elderly members Su Er'gong and Fan Dongsheng criticized the cooperative for starting water conservancy projects too late in the past two years, usually in November or December. At that time, the weather was cold, the number of workers was small, and the quality of the projects was poor. They suggested starting water conservancy projects earlier this year. In late September, the management committee organized labor to repair a large pond. Five other ponds were also under construction, and a comprehensive plan was made to repair all of the cooperative's small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. The members also demanded that the cooperative make its financial accounts public, which it promptly did. Recently, the cooperative's custodians conducted a major inventory of agricultural implements, assigned numbers, and designated specific personnel to be responsible for them. Agricultural implements not currently in use were properly stored. This improvement was also based on criticism from the members. The members also criticized the supply and marketing cooperative, such as in the past, when farmers bought lampshades, the supply and marketing cooperative would force them to buy lamp holders. And farmers were not allowed to choose when they bought iron pots and earthenware jars. Now the supply and marketing cooperative has abolished these unreasonable regulations.

    The members are very satisfied that the Party branch and the cooperative management committee were able to improve their work immediately. After the finances were made public, Zu Yueshan, a member of the second team, said, "Now the cooperative has shown us its assets. Whether we lose money or make money, I feel at ease seeing it." Li Haiqing, a member who previously had complaints about the cooperative's poor management of agricultural implements, had taken a plow and a cattle feeding bucket home. Now that the cooperative is managing the implements seriously, he has returned these items. Such rapid improvement has increased the members' confidence in running the cooperative well and encouraged their labor enthusiasm. The cooperative originally planned to plant sixty mu of autumn sweet potatoes but actually completed ninety-six mu. All seven hundred and thirty mu of the cooperative's fields have been plowed and planted with spring-harvest crops such as grass seeds, rapeseed, and wheat. Member Su Er'gong said, "If we had worked as hard last year as we are working this year, we would have harvested more grain this year." Seeing that the cooperative's autumn and winter production is going well, the members all say that next year looks promising.

    Because the cooperative management committee swiftly improved its work, focused on current production, and further sparked a new surge of "letting off steam," the cooperative has collected more than eight hundred various opinions. Now, the cooperative is categorizing and prioritizing these opinions, and a mass debate to distinguish between right and wrong is about to unfold throughout the cooperative.

    群众的正确批评立竿见影
    长沙大兴一社大力改进工作
    推动了当前生产　提高了鸣放热情
    本报讯　湖南省长沙县高山乡大兴一社在社会主义大辩论中迅速改进工作，不仅有力地推动了当前生产，并且使社员进一步解除顾虑，大鸣大放。
    这个社9月初就开始社会主义大辩论。一部分社员对农业社的经营管理、城乡关系等方面提出一些意见，但仍有一部分社员有顾虑，怕提出意见没有着落。这个社的党支部和管委会根据这种情况，就将社员已经提出的可以改进的工作上的缺点，立即改进。如老年社员粟二公、范冬生批评社里这两年对兴修水利工作抓得太晚，一般都在11、12月份开始，那时天寒地冻，出工人数少，工程质量也不好，他们建议今年要及早兴修水利。管委会在9月下旬就组织劳动力，修好一口大塘，另外五口塘也陆续动工，对全社的小型农田水利工程也作出了全面整修的规划。社员们在鸣放中要求社里公开财务账目，社里立即把账目公布。最近，社里的保管员都把农具作了一次大清查，编了号码，确定专人负责，暂时不用的农具也好好收藏起来，这也是根据社员提出的批评，加以改进的。社员们在鸣放中还对供销合作社提出一些批评，如过去农民买灯罩子，供销社一定要农民连灯座子买，农民买铁锅和瓦罐，不准挑选。现在供销社已取消了这些不合理的规定。
    社员们对党支部和社管委会能立即改进工作，非常满意。财务公开后，二队社员祖月山说：“这下社里把家底子给我们看了，不管赔钱赚钱，我看到就放心了。”社员李海清原来对社里农具保管不好有意见，曾把一张犁、一张牛料桶搬回家去，现在社里对农具保管认真了，他又把这些东西交出来。这样迅速改进工作，增加了社员们办好社的信心，鼓舞了社员们的劳动热情。全社原计划种秋红薯六十亩，实际完成了九十六亩。全社七百三十亩田，已经全部翻耕过来，种上了草子、油菜、麦子等春收作物。社员粟二公说：“如果去年也像今年这样下力搞，今年还要多打粮。”广大社员看到社里秋冬生产搞得好，都说明年有奔头。
    由于社管委会迅速改进了工作，抓紧当前生产，又进一步掀起大鸣大放的热潮。全社已搜集了各种意见八百多条。现在，这个社正在把各种意见分类排队，一场分清大是大非的群众性的大辩论，即将在全社展开。
