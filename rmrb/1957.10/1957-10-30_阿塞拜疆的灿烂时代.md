    The Splendid Era of Azerbaijan
    By Our Correspondent Cheng Guangrui

    Many centuries ago, in the Surakhani district on the outskirts of Baku, stood a square tower surrounded by columns, with an eternally burning flame in a lamp atop the columns. This tower was a place of longing for the fire-worshippers of that time. Pilgrims from various Eastern countries flocked to this "miracle" to worship. They did not know that the burning was methane gas emanating from the oil strata, secretly piped to the lamp by the priests. Because of this miraculous flame, the country was later called the "Land of Fire," or "Azerbaijan" in their native language.

    National Suffering and Rebirth
    Azerbaijan is an ancient nation with a history of three thousand years. As early as the 4th to 3rd centuries BC, the tribes living here established a federal state. However, for many centuries afterward, this country was invaded and ruled by Persians, Arabs, Mongols, and other foreign peoples. After merging with the Russian Empire in 1828, it became a colony of Tsarist Russia, known as the "prison of nations." The Azerbaijani people lived a life of extreme suffering under the Tsarist Russian policy of national oppression.

    The great victory of the October Revolution brought freedom and independence to the Azerbaijani people. With the help of the Russian people and the Red Army, the Azerbaijani people, after a long and arduous struggle, finally drove out the foreign armed interventionists and domestic counter-revolutionary forces, establishing the Azerbaijan Soviet Republic in 1920. In December 1936, it joined the Soviet Union, becoming a member of this large family of equality and harmony among all nationalities. Azerbaijan, this ancient nation, has regained its youth and is entering a splendid new era.

    "Black Gold" Shines Again
    Anyone arriving in the "Oil City" of Baku for the first time cannot help but be amazed by the forests of oil derricks and the remarkable offshore oil extraction near Baku. Every day and night, tens of thousands of tons of "black gold" are extracted from the ground and seabed here.

    In the pre-revolutionary era, Azerbaijan's "black gold" was also covered in dust. At that time, Baku's oil was exploited by more than a hundred oil companies from the United States, Britain, and Imperial Russia. Like vampires, they sucked away Azerbaijan's oil and drained the blood of Baku's workers. After the Azerbaijani people established the Soviet Republic in 1920, they drove out these vampires. But they were not reconciled; they destroyed nine hundred and sixty oil wells in the Baku region, leaving only one hundred and forty. At Lenin's suggestion, Soviet Russia gave Azerbaijan enormous assistance in restoring its oil industry. Today, the latest science and technology are fully utilized in Azerbaijan's oil industry. Since last year, television has been used to inspect oil wells. Workers do not need to go to the oil wells; they only need to turn on the television to see the production situation at the oil wells.

    The oil industry occupies a very important position in Azerbaijan's industry. However, today Azerbaijan's industry is not entirely oil-based. After the revolution, Azerbaijan gradually established and developed metallurgical, non-ferrous metal, chemical, machine-building, light, textile, and food industries. In 1956, Azerbaijan's total industrial output increased more than eleven times compared to 1913 before the revolution.

    Water and "White Gold"
    Azerbaijan has mountains, plains, rivers, and pastures. The natural and climatic conditions make it possible to grow grain and develop animal husbandry. However, before the revolution, much of the land was uncultivated. The Kura River valley was a hot and arid plain, but no one paid attention to water conservancy. After the establishment of the republic, Lenin immediately called on the Azerbaijani Communists to quickly improve the living conditions of the peasants and begin the great work of electrification and irrigation. Lenin also telegraphed the Azerbaijani Republic's government, mobilizing soil experts to study the problem of planting grain seeds in Azerbaijan's land. The construction of the Mingachevir Hydroelectric Station on the Kura River not only provides a large amount of electricity to the republic and the entire Transcaucasia region, but also created a huge Mingachevir artificial lake near the hydroelectric station, irrigating the surrounding land. The saline soil in the Caspian Sea coastal area has also been solved with the opening up of freshwater artificial rivers. Now, grain can be grown in all regions of Azerbaijan.

    The Azerbaijanis have said since ancient times that in Azerbaijan, "what is black is oil, and what is white is cotton." Cotton is Azerbaijan's main agricultural product and is Azerbaijan's "white gold." However, before the revolution, the area and yield of cotton in Azerbaijan were very small. In 1913, Azerbaijan's cotton output was only 100,000 tons. Currently, Azerbaijan's cotton output ranks second in the entire Soviet Union. This year's output will reach 400,000 tons. In addition, Azerbaijan also grows many fruits, grapes, tea, and tobacco. In recent years, animal husbandry has been vigorously developed. The income of agricultural workers in collective farms has greatly increased.

    New Flowers of Ancient Culture
    Although Azerbaijan has three thousand years of culture, 90% of Azerbaijanis were illiterate before the revolution. During the Tsarist rule, it was forbidden to publish books and educate children in the Azerbaijani national script, and it was forbidden to sing and act in the Azerbaijani national language. Azerbaijanis were even forced to use foreign names as their own. At that time, the garden of Azerbaijani national culture was barren!

    After the establishment of the Soviet Republic, Azerbaijan first eliminated all illiteracy in the ten years from 1921 to 1931. Later, it implemented a seven-year universal education system in urban and rural areas, and recently began to implement a ten-year universal education system. Before the revolution, Azerbaijan did not have a single institution of higher learning. The children of capitalists were sent to London or St. Petersburg to attend universities. Now, Azerbaijan not only has a state university, but also various higher specialized schools. Before the revolution, Azerbaijan had no scientific research institutions. Now, Azerbaijan has established an Academy of Sciences, with eighty-three scientific research institutes, one hundred and fifty-four doctors and two thousand five hundred associate doctors, as well as academicians in medicine, agriculture, and art. Currently, in the Republic of Azerbaijan, there is not a single village without a library and a club.

    The Pearl of Azerbaijan
    The Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijani Party said to us when talking about Baku: "Before the revolution, there were no asphalt roads and no sewers here. At that time, the only means of transportation was horse-drawn carriages. Even the coastline here was the private property of capitalists. There were no theaters, cinemas, or clubs here, only some gambling dens frequented by capitalists who squandered money..."

    Of course, this situation is long gone. Baku is rapidly changing its appearance with the development of the republic. Just a couple of examples will suffice. From the start of construction of the first tramway line in Baku in 1923 to today, the total length of Baku's tram, trolleybus, and bus lines has reached two thousand five hundred kilometers. Baku used to be known as the "City of Winds" and had few trees. Today, Baku is full of greenery and fragrant flowers.

    Baku, nestled against the mountains and facing the sea, becoming more beautiful day by day, you are a pearl of Azerbaijan. Like your nation, you radiate brilliant light in the multi-ethnic family of the Soviet Union.

    阿塞拜疆的灿烂时代
    本报记者　程光锐
    许多世纪以前，在巴库郊外的苏拉哈内地方，耸立着一座四周围着园柱的方塔，园柱顶端的灯里燃烧着永不熄灭的火焰。这座塔曾是当时拜火教徒们朝夕思慕的地方。东方各国的朝圣者，络绎不绝地来到这个“奇迹”前面顶礼膜拜。他们不知道这是石油地层里排出的煤气在燃烧，这是那些祭司们偷偷地把煤气引到灯上去的。就因为这里燃烧着奇妙的火焰，后来这个国家的名字就叫做“火之国”，用他们民族的语言来说，就是“阿塞拜疆”。
    民族的苦难和新生
    阿塞拜疆是个古老的民族，它已有三千年的历史。早在公元前四世纪到三世纪，住在这里的部族就建立了联邦国家。然而，后来在许多世纪中，这个国家都受到波斯人、阿拉伯人、蒙古人等外族的侵略和统治。1828年同俄罗斯帝国合并之后，又成了被称为“各民族监狱”的沙皇俄国的殖民地。阿塞拜疆人民，在沙皇俄国的民族压迫政策下，过着痛苦不堪的生活。
    十月革命的伟大胜利给阿塞拜疆人民带来了自由和独立。阿塞拜疆人民，在俄罗斯人民和红军的帮助下，经过了长期艰苦的斗争，终于赶走了外国武装干涉者和国内反革命势力，在1920年建立了阿塞拜疆苏维埃共和国，1936年12月加入了苏联，成为这个各民族平等和睦的大家庭的一员。阿塞拜疆，这个古老的民族又恢复了它的青春，开始进入一个灿烂的新时代。
    “黑金”重新发光
    初到“石油城”巴库的人，都不能不为巴库附近森林般的油井铁塔和奇妙的海底采油而惊奇。这里每昼夜要从地下和海底采出几万吨“黑金”来。
    在革命前的年代里，阿塞拜疆的“黑金”也蒙了一层灰尘。那时候，巴库的石油是由美国、英国和帝俄的一百多个石油公司开采的。他们像吸血鬼一样，吸走了阿塞拜疆的石油，吸干了巴库工人的鲜血。1920年阿塞拜疆人民建立苏维埃共和国以后，赶走了这批吸血鬼。可是他们并不甘心，他们把巴库地区的九百六十个油井破坏得只剩下一百四十个了。按照列宁的建议，苏维埃俄罗斯在恢复石油工业方面给阿塞拜疆以巨大的帮助。目前，在阿塞拜疆石油工业中，充分利用着新的科学技术。从去年起已经利用电视来视察油井了。工人们不必到油井上去，只要打开电视机，油井上的生产情况就一目了然了。
    石油工业在阿塞拜疆工业中占着十分重要的地位。然而今天阿塞拜疆的工业并不完全是石油工业。革命后，阿塞拜疆逐渐建立并发展了冶金工业、有色金属工业、化学工业、机器制造业、轻工业、纺织工业和食品工业。1956年阿塞拜疆的工业总产量比革命前的1913年增加了十一倍以上。
    水和“白金”
    阿塞拜疆有高山，有平原，有水流，有牧场，自然和气候条件都使这里可能种植谷物和发展畜牧业。然而，革命前许多土地都未垦殖。库拉河谷是个炎热而缺水的平原，水利问题却无人注意。共和国建立后，列宁立即号召阿塞拜疆的共产党员们，从速努力改善农民生活状况和开始电气化和灌溉的巨大工作。列宁并且打电报给阿塞拜疆共和国政府，发动土壤专家研究在阿塞拜疆土地上种植谷种问题。库拉河上明格查乌尔水电站的建设不仅供给共和国和外高加索各地大量电力，而且在水电站附近出现了巨大的明格查乌尔人工湖，使附近土地获得灌溉。里海沿岸地区含有盐分的土壤，也用开辟淡水人工河的办法，解决了灌溉问题。现在，在阿塞拜疆各个地区都可以种植谷物了。
    自古阿塞拜疆人就说，在阿塞拜疆土地上，“黑的是石油，白的是棉花”。棉花是阿塞拜疆的主要农产品，是阿塞拜疆的“白金”。然而，革命前阿塞拜疆棉花的播种面积和产量都很小，1913年阿塞拜疆棉花的产量只有十万吨。目前阿塞拜疆棉花的产量在全苏联已占第二位。今年的产量将达到四十万吨。此外，阿塞拜疆也种植了许多水果、葡萄、茶叶和烟叶。最近几年正大力发展畜牧业。集体农庄的农业劳动者收入大大增加了。
    古文化的新花朵
    阿塞拜疆虽然有三千年的文化，可是，革命前阿塞拜疆人有90％是文盲。沙皇统治时期，不准用阿塞拜疆的民族文字出版书籍和教育儿童，不准用阿塞拜疆的民族语言唱歌和演戏。阿塞拜疆人甚至不得不用外国人的姓名当作自己的姓名。那时候，阿塞拜疆民族文化的园地上是一片荒芜！
    苏维埃共和国建立后，阿塞拜疆首先在1921年到1931年十年中扫除了全部文盲。后来又在城乡实行了七年制普及教育，最近已开始实行十年制普及教育。革命前，阿塞拜疆没有一所高等学校，资本家的孩子要上高等学校都是送到伦敦或彼得堡去。现在，阿塞拜疆不仅有国立大学，而且还有各种高等专科学校。革命前，阿塞拜疆没有科学研究机关，现在，阿塞拜疆已成立了科学院，有八十三个科学研究所，有一百五十四位博士和二千五百位副博士，还有医学、农业和艺术方面的院士。目前，在阿塞拜疆共和国里，没有一个乡村里没有图书馆和俱乐部。
    阿塞拜疆的明珠
    阿塞拜疆党中央宣传部长和我们谈起巴库的时候说：“革命前这里没有柏油马路，没有上下水道。当时唯一的交通工具就是马车。这里连海岸都是资本家的私产。这里没有剧院、电影院和俱乐部，有的只是一些挥金如土的资本家们常去的大赌窟……”
    当然，这种情景早已一去不复返了。巴库随着共和国的发展而迅速地改变着自己的面貌。这里只举一两个例子就够了。从1923年巴库开始建筑第一条电车路到今天，巴库的电车、无轨电车和公共汽车线路的总长度已达到两千五百公里。巴库过去被称为“风城”，树木很少。如今巴库已是处处绿荫，满街花香了。
    傍山靠海的一天比一天更加美丽的巴库，你是阿塞拜疆的一颗明珠。你和你的民族一样，在苏联的多民族大家庭中，放射着灿烂的光芒。
