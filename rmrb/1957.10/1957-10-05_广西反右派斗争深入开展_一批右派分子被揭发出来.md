    Guangxi Deepens the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    A Batch of Rightists are Exposed

    (Reported by our newspaper) In the recent period, in the continued and deepened anti-Rightist struggle in Guangxi Province, a batch of Rightists have been exposed. These Rightists are distributed in state organs, schools, and commercial departments, and they spread various fallacies to slander the Party's leadership and oppose socialism.

    Chen Xiong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) and a Rightist, recently exposed, openly shielded Rightists Wan Zhongwen, Chen Liangzuo, and Lai Huipeng in the anti-Rightist struggle. Chen Xiong hated the new society and slandered activists as "roles who shout 'Long Live' three times." Lai Huipeng, Deputy Director of the Guangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, member of the Standing Committee of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the RCCK, and a Rightist, chose the Livestock and Veterinary Medicine Department, where the Party's leadership was relatively weak, to attack the Party, slandering the Party committee for squeezing out animal husbandry, and saying, "All livestock farms where Communist Party members are directors are no good." Ni Hu (editor of the News Group of the Guangxi People's Broadcasting Station), a Rightist recently exposed in the Guangxi People's Broadcasting Station, was a class alien who had infiltrated the Communist Youth League. He incited Communist Youth League members in the station to attack the Party, and said, "If the station does not solve the problem, we will raise a big banner and go to the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee to file a complaint!" Yu Lanfeng (female), a Rightist in the former Transportation Office of the Provincial People's Committee, often distorted and slandered various systems of the new society and often promoted the "civilization" of imperialism. Chen Lizhen (female), an accountant in the Finance Department of the Liuzhou Railway Administration, viciously slandered the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, saying that the Party's leadership was "hypocritical" and that "the Party's leadership controls all power and arbitrarily destroys the people." Xie Wu, an inspector of the Liuzhou Supervisory Office of the State Supervisory Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, attempted to reclaim the land confiscated during the land reform, saying that "the landlords' land was not obtained through exploitation." He slandered the Party's training of worker-peasant cadres as training "nobles," and said that the Cultural Cadre School was the "Imperial College" of the autocratic era. Liu Bing, deputy leader of the Youth and Agriculture Group of the Guangxi Youth Daily Editorial Department, consistently peddled bourgeois journalistic views. He emphasized "independence," saying that the Communist Youth League Committee did not understand the newspaper's business and it was difficult for them to lead. He also openly slandered the Communist Youth League newspaper's socialist propaganda to young people as "deceiving young people." Lu Changda, chairman of the Liuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, president of the Liuzhou Municipal People's Bank, and a Rightist, in order to expand his anti-socialist political capital, frantically developed his organization in Liuzhou. After the rectification began, under the guise of helping the Communist Party to rectify, he instructed his cronies to convene four symposiums in grassroots units such as banks, food companies, and service bureaus to attack the Communist Party. Lu Changda repeatedly praised: "Well done, well done." Chen Yaofang, director of the Xingguang Photo Studio in Liuzhou, a joint state-private enterprise, viciously attacked the leadership of the Communist Party, denied the superiority of joint state-private ownership, and described socialism as "a pile of darkness, with nothing." He also frantically clamored: "The working class can transform the bourgeoisie, why can't our bourgeoisie transform the working class into the bourgeoisie?" It can be seen how stubborn and frantic this bourgeois Rightist is. Xie Kefa, a teacher at Guilin No. 2 Middle School and a Rightist, said that the Party did not understand dialectics, that the Party was "timid as a mouse" and afraid of revisionism. He believed that revisionism "is not bad in itself."

    Various units are exposing and criticizing these Rightists' reactionary words and deeds, and are launching a struggle to reason with them.

    广西反右派斗争深入开展
    一批右派分子被揭发出来
    本报讯　最近一个时期，广西省在继续深入开展的反右派斗争中，揭发出一批右派分子。这些右派分子分布在国家机关、学校和商业部门，他们散播各种各样的谬论来污蔑党的领导，反对社会主义。
    最近被揭发的民革广西省常委、右派分子陈雄，在反右派斗争中公开包庇右派分子万仲文、陈良佐、赖慧鹏等人。陈雄仇恨新社会，污蔑积极分子是“三呼万岁的角色”。广西省农业厅副厅长、民革广西省常委、右派分子赖慧鹏，选择了党的领导力量较薄弱的畜牧兽医处向党进攻，污蔑党委排挤了畜牧业，并且说“凡是共产党员当场长的畜牧场，都没有好的”。最近在广西人民广播电台被揭露的右派分子倪虎（该台新闻组编辑），是一个混入共青团的阶级异己分子，他在电台内到处煽动共青团员向党进攻，并说“如果电台不解决问题，就要扯大旗到省委宣传部告状去！”省人民委员会原交通办公室的右派分子于岚峰（女）经常对新社会的各种制度进行歪曲和污蔑，并常鼓吹帝国主义的“文明”。柳州铁路管理局财务处核算员陈丽桢（女），恶毒地污蔑党和知识分子的关系，说党的领导是“伪善者”，说“党的领导把持了一切权力，任意摧残人民。”铁道部国家监察局柳州监察办事处监察员谢武企图夺回他在土改时被没收的土地，说“地主的土地不是剥削来的”，他污蔑党培养工农干部是培养“贵族”，说文化干部学校是专制时代的“国子监”。广西青年报编辑部青农组副组长刘冰，一贯贩卖资产阶级新闻观点。强调“独立性”，说团委不懂报社业务很难领导。并且公开污蔑团报对青年进行社会主义宣传是“欺骗青年”。农工民主党柳州市工委主委、柳州市人民银行行长、右派分子陆昌达为了扩大反社会主义的政治资本，在柳州疯狂地发展组织，整风开始后，他打着帮助共产党整风的幌子，指使他的亲信们先后在银行、食品公司、服务局等基层单位召开了四次座谈会，攻击共产党，陆昌达连声赞赏：“开得好，开得好。”柳州市公私合营星光照相馆门市部主任、右派分子陈耀芳恶毒地攻击共产党的领导，否认公私合营的优越性，把社会主义说成是“一团黑暗，要什么没什么”。他还疯狂叫嚣：“工人阶级可以改造资产阶级，我们资产阶级为什么不可以改造工人阶级为资产阶级呢？”可见这个资产阶级右派分子顽固疯狂到何等地步。桂林二中教师、右派分子谢可法说党不懂得辩证法，说党“胆小如鼠”，害怕修正主义。他认为修正主义“这东西本身并不坏”。
    各单位对这些右派分子的反动言行，正进行揭发批判，并展开说理斗争。
