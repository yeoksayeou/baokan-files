    Chen Bisheng Admits Guilt for Colluding with and Ganging Up with Luo Longji
    Rightist Chen Bisheng, a researcher at the Nanyang Research Institute of Xiamen University, went to Beijing for a meeting in 1951. Luo Longji told him that the Communist Party is very realistic; how much strength you have determines how much they value you. He instructed Chen to set up strongholds in Fujian after returning, to build up strength. From then on, Chen Bisheng became the agent of the Luo Longji group in Fujian.

    During the blooming and contending period, Chen Bisheng spoke wildly at a forum held by the Xiamen Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, provoking the relationship between the democratic parties and the Communist Party. He slandered the relationship between the United Front Work Department of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the CPC and the democratic parties as that of an evil mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law. He proposed asking the Communist Party for three powers: the power of appointment (the power of appointment unrestricted by the state personnel system), the power of speech (to tamper with the political line of democratic parties' newspapers and periodicals), and the power of finance (to obtain a sum of anti-Party activity funds).

    Chen Bisheng distorted the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, attacking the dangerous nature of the people's democratic dictatorship, saying that democratic parties should act as fuses and be "supervisory officials." He vigorously advocated the great development of the China Democratic League, absorbing middle and backward elements, so that the China Democratic League could stand up to the Party as an equal. Chen Bisheng also tried to usurp the Party's leadership over science, culture, and education, clamoring that the Party was an "amateur," and "amateurs cannot lead professionals," and openly echoed Zhang Bojun's fallacy of a political design institute, advocating that the China Democratic League should play a leading and designing role in cultural and educational work, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party should play a leading and designing role in science, technology, and health work.

    Under the just struggle of the masses, Chen Bisheng had to admit that he and Luo Longji had colluded and ganged up with each other, had a reactionary political relationship, and admitted that he was a consistently anti-Communist rightist.

    同罗隆基拉拢勾结陈碧笙承认有罪
    厦门大学南洋研究所研究员右派分子陈碧笙，1951年到北京开会，罗隆基曾告诉他说，共产党最现实，你有多少实力他就重视你到什么程度。吩咐陈回福建后要设据点，搞实力。从此，陈碧笙就成为罗隆基集团在福建的代理人。
    鸣放期间，陈碧笙在中共厦门市委召开的座谈会大肆放毒，挑拨民主党派和共产党的关系。诬蔑中共福建省委统战部和民主党派的关系是恶婆婆和媳妇的关系。他提出向共产党要三权：用人权（不受国家人事制度约束的用人权）、发言权（篡改民主党派报刊的政治路线）、财政权（搞一笔反党活动经费）。
    陈碧笙歪曲长期共存、互相监督的方针，攻击人民民主专政有危险性，说民主党派应起保险丝的作用，当“监察御史”。他极力主张民盟大发展，吸收中间、落后分子，使民盟与党分庭抗礼。陈碧笙还力图篡夺党对科学文教的领导权，叫嚣党是“外行”，“外行不能领导内行”，并公开响应章伯钧的政治设计院的谬论，主张民盟应在文教工作中起领导和设计作用，农工民主党应在科技卫生工作中起领导、设计作用。
    在群众的正义斗争下，陈碧笙不得不承认他和罗隆基互相拉拢勾结，有反动的政治关系，承认自己是一贯反共的右派分子。
