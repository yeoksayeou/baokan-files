Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, October 25th: Soviet experts who were invited by our government to provide technical assistance to the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have demonstrated a lofty internationalist spirit in their work.

Maslov, a Soviet land reclamation expert in his sixties, often braved wind and cold and worked tirelessly during the reconnaissance work for the Kongque First Farm in the southern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, wading through grassy marshes for days on end. In his work, he not only conscientiously put forward his own suggestions, but also attached great importance to the opinions of Chinese experts and technicians. Soviet agronomist Titov often took time out of his work at the August 1st Agricultural College to go deep into the farms for field investigations and research, so as to better combine Soviet experience with China's production reality. He said to the students of the Agricultural College: "To become an excellent agronomist, you must eat at least a ton of dust in the fields."

Soviet experts are very concerned about the growth of Chinese technical personnel. They often squeeze time out of their busy work to give lectures and practical guidance to young Chinese technicians. Soviet agronomist Gorelov and animal husbandry expert Rastochkin helped the August 1st Agricultural College open two refresher courses to train specialized technical personnel. During the day, the experts of the Soviet land consolidation team guided the soil survey personnel of the troops to work in the wasteland, and at night they laid out drawings and design books to lecture the technicians of the troops, regardless of their own fatigue. Maslov, the gray-haired Soviet land consolidation expert, and Ferashuk, the soil expert, often jumped into deep pits to give the technical personnel of the troops demonstration guidance on checking profiles, always patiently teaching them until they learned. Over the past few years, with the sincere and selfless help of Soviet experts, the Production and Construction Corps has cultivated a large number of excellent technical personnel.

The leading organs and technical personnel of the Production and Construction Corps also regularly receive letters from Soviet experts who have completed their service and returned to their motherland. In their letters, they continue to impart new technical experience to Chinese comrades. Kara Lyalov, a Soviet agricultural machinery repair expert who worked in the Production and Construction Corps for three years, sent a letter from Moscow this year providing eleven advanced experiences, enabling the Production and Construction Corps to achieve new achievements in tractor repair technology.

### 苏联专家以崇高的国际主义精神  为新疆生产建设兵团培养技术人材

    苏联专家以崇高的国际主义精神
    为新疆生产建设兵团培养技术人材
    新华社乌鲁木齐25日电　应我国政府聘请、前来新疆生产建设兵团进行技术援助的苏联专家们，在工作中表现了崇高的国际主义精神。
    六十多岁的苏联土地整理专家马斯洛夫，在天山南麓进行孔雀第一农场的勘查工作中，常常不避风寒，不辞辛劳，连日徒涉草滩沼地，艰苦地工作。他在工作中不但认真提出自己的建议，而且十分重视中国专家和技术人员们的意见。苏联农学专家提托夫在八一农学院工作时经常抽出时间深入农场，实地调查研究，以便把苏联的经验同中国的生产实际更好地结合起来。他向农学院的学生们说：“要成为一个优秀的农学家，至少要在田间吃上一吨灰尘。”
    苏联专家们十分关怀中国技术人员的成长。他们经常在繁忙的工作中挤出时间，给年轻的中国技术员讲课和进行实习指导。苏联农学家果列洛夫和畜牧业专家拉斯托契金帮助八一农学院开办了两个进修班，培养专业技术人材。苏联土地整理组的专家们白天在荒地上指导部队的土壤调查人员们工作，晚上就摆开图纸和设计书给部队的技术员讲课，不顾自己的劳累。白发苍苍的苏联土地整理专家马斯洛夫和土壤专家费拉修克还常常跳进深坑里，给部队的技术人员们作检查剖面的示范指导，总是耐心地把对方教会为止。几年来，在苏联专家真诚无私的帮助下，生产兵团已经培养出了一大批优秀的技术人材。
    生产兵团的领导机关和技术人员们还经常收到已经服务期满、回到祖国的苏联专家们的来信。他们在信中继续向中国同志传授新的技术经验。曾经在生产兵团工作过三年的苏联农业机械修配专家卡拉辽夫，今年从莫斯科来信提供了十一项先进经验，使生产兵团在拖拉机修配技术上又获得了新的成就。
