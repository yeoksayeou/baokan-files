　　The Bumper Harvest Demonstration Plots of Lianping County Cadres
　　By our reporter Wu Erxiang
    Since the spring plowing this year, rural cadres in Lianping County, Guangdong Province, have each been responsible for managing a small plot of high-yield demonstration field. On the one hand, they familiarize themselves with the agricultural seasons and delve into production techniques by participating in the production of demonstration fields. On the other hand, they discover and solve problems in a timely manner during the production of demonstration fields, and use production to guide production. Therefore, they have gained the praise of farmers.
    The production of high-yield fields is carried out in cooperation between cadres and agricultural cooperatives. Cadres provide ideas, formulate measures, and ask farmers for help and guidance. From sowing and raising seedlings to harvesting, cadres directly participate. Fertilizers for high-yield fields are provided by the cadres; they pay for commercial fertilizers, and the harvest goes to the agricultural cooperative.
    The demonstration fields of Lianping County cadres began in 1954. However, at that time, it was limited to a small number of agricultural technicians, and the main purpose was to test new cultivation techniques and conduct demonstration and promotion. Therefore, it was called a "small farm." The approach to demonstration fields was also different from the present. At that time, they adopted the method of contracting work and output to cooperatives. They did everything themselves. If they failed to reach the contracted output, they had to compensate. This approach played a certain role in changing the work style of technical cadres and delving into production techniques. However, it was divorced from the masses. On the one hand, it lacked practical farming experience, and at the same time, it often resulted in missed work due to meetings or other work. As a result, most of the demonstration fields were not well managed. Either too much commercial fertilizer was used, resulting in high costs; or the output was very low and could not reach the contracted targets, and the cadres in charge had to pay out of their own pockets to compensate the farmers. For example, in 1955, the cadres of the agricultural technology promotion station in the Huihua District asked an agricultural cooperative for a piece of land to cultivate, originally contracted to produce 650 jin per mu per crop. In the beginning, they did not do badly, but after transplanting the seedlings, they went to the county for a meeting, which lasted for more than ten days. The farmers had weeded their fields twice after transplanting the seedlings, while they had not weeded them even once. The farmers did not know what they were doing, and they did not dare to help them. As a result, this field only yielded 520 jin per mu per crop, losing more than 100 jin of rice.
    The cadres of the agricultural technology promotion station in Zhongxin District adopted another approach, which was to provide ideas and cooperate with the agricultural cooperative. When they went to meetings, the agricultural cooperative helped take care of the fields. As a result, the production was very good. The 1.3 mu demonstration field yielded more than 1,360 jin per mu per year in 1955, creating the highest high-yield record in the county.
  This spring, in order to change the leadership style of cadres and overcome the general and bureaucratic work style in production leadership, the Lianping County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee on cadres participating in physical labor, made two regulations: one is that township and cooperative cadres must spend 30% of their time participating in physical labor, and county and district cadres must participate in physical labor for an average of four to five days per month; the other is to cooperate with the masses in running demonstration fields and implement production to guide production. Therefore, since this spring, from the first secretary of the county party committee to the township and cooperative cadres, in addition to actively participating in physical labor in accordance with the instructions of the county party committee, they have universally started to manage demonstration fields. In Zhongxin District, each cadre manages an average of three-tenths of a mu of demonstration field.
    Because the production of demonstration fields adopted advanced cultivation techniques and received enthusiastic support and help from the masses, the advanced cultivation techniques and the experience of the masses were combined. Therefore, a good harvest was generally achieved in the early rice this year. For example, Li Ming, the first secretary of the county party committee, worked with district cadres in Xindong Township to cultivate more than seven-tenths of a mu of demonstration field. Due to early transplanting and the application of a large amount of organic fertilizer, the early rice yield was more than 600 jin, an increase of more than 100 jin compared with the agricultural cooperative's fields. Zhu Yuanbiao, secretary of the county party committee, together with Zeng Hongqi, secretary of the Zhongxin District Party Committee, and Wu Qishou, a district cadre, cultivated 1.73 mu of demonstration field in Guanbi Township. The early rice harvest this year reached 1,073 jin, while last year this field only yielded 792 jin of early rice.
    In the past, cadres led production by listening to reports and making general calls, and they themselves had only a superficial understanding. Therefore, the calls they made were difficult to convince the masses, and they were often not timely. Participating in the production of demonstration fields not only urged them to delve into production techniques and familiarize themselves with agricultural seasons, but also enabled them to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, the secretary of the Zhongxin District Party Committee, during the sowing and seedling raising period this year, found that the seedlings in his rice paddies suddenly turned yellow. He consulted with the cadres of the agricultural technology promotion station and learned that it was due to the failure to apply fertilizer in time, which affected the growth of the seedlings. He immediately notified the agricultural cooperatives in the district to conduct rice paddy inspections. Under this promotion, a campaign of rice paddy fertilization was launched throughout the district in a timely manner. Therefore, the early rice seedlings grew particularly well this year. Zhu Yuanbiao, secretary of the county party committee, used to listen to the experiences introduced by other counties, and they all said that pulling seedlings was better than hoeing seedlings, which could increase production, but the local farmers disagreed, and he himself was not sure and did not dare to promote it. During the spring plowing this year, he and the district cadres took out more than five-tenths of a mu of land in their demonstration field to conduct an experiment of changing hoeing seedlings to pulling seedlings. As expected, the seedlings in the field where seedlings were pulled grew better than the surrounding fields where seedlings were hoeed. When the masses came to visit, they praised them. During the summer harvest, the field where seedlings were pulled yielded more than 300 jin, an increase of more than 20% compared to the field where seedlings were hoeed. The cadres of the Red Star Cooperative in Guanbi Township have decided to change 40% of the fields from hoeing seedlings to pulling seedlings next year.
    Doing a good job in demonstration fields has been adopted by Lianping County cadres as an important method of leading production. At important stages of production, they first set an example in their own high-yield fields, and then organize visits, evaluations, and promotion. Huang Niangxin, secretary of the Guanbi Township Party Branch and director of the Red Star Cooperative, cooperated with Huang Yusheng, director of the Zhongxin District Agricultural Technology Promotion Station, to cultivate a demonstration field of about ten mu. From sowing and transplanting to harvesting, all advanced cultivation techniques were adopted, and they took the lead, which played a great role in promoting technical reform in the cooperative. According to local customs, the first intertillage and topdressing were carried out ten days after transplanting. For their own demonstration fields, they started the first intertillage and topdressing seven days after transplanting, and then organized the masses to observe. Facts proved that early intertillage and topdressing were indeed beneficial, so the masses followed suit. For example, for the first topdressing after transplanting, the masses used lime regardless of whether it was fertile or barren land. They changed this unreasonable fertilization habit for the first time. According to the characteristics of this sandy and barren land, manure water was used for the first topdressing, and the seedlings grew vigorously. They organized observations again, so the masses also learned to apply manure water or lime according to different soil types. Huang Niangxin believes that running demonstration fields is indeed of great benefit. This practice has helped him learn many new things. For example, he did not have a deep understanding of seizing the season in the past. Although he called it every day, he always felt that it was okay to miss one or two days. Now that he tried it himself, he realized that the growth of seedlings was different by one day. He also said that in the past, leading production was just talking, and the masses would not listen even if his mouth was dry. The force of the masses' habits is difficult to change with general calls. If he sets an example himself and lets the masses watch and do it, it will be much easier.

　　连平县干部的丰产示范田
　　本报记者  吴尔祥
    广东省连平县的农村干部，从今年春耕开始，每人都负责管理一小块丰产示范田。他们一方面通过参加示范田的生产，熟悉农时，钻研生产技术，一方面在参加示范田的生产过程中，及时发现问题，解决问题，以生产指导生产，因此获得了农民的赞许。
    丰产田的生产是由干部和农业社合作进行的。干部出主意，订措施，请农民帮助和指导。从播种、育苗一直到收割，干部都直接参加，丰产田的肥料，由干部供给，商品肥料由他们出钱去买，收成归农业社。
    连平县干部的示范田，是从1954年就开始的。但是那时只是限于少数的农业技术干部在做，主要目的是试验新的耕作技术，进行示范推广，因此把它叫做“小农场”。示范田做法上也和现在不同，那时他们采取向合作社包工包产的办法，一切都是他们自己做，如果达不到包产的产量，他们就得赔偿。这样做法，对技术干部改变作风，钻研生产技术，是起了一定的作用。但是它脱离群众，一方面缺乏实际的耕作经验，同时往往由于开会或其他工作而误工，结果大多数的示范田都管理得不好，不是用商品肥太多，成本很高；就是产量很低，不能达到包产的指标，要由负责管理的干部掏腰包赔偿给农民。比如1955年，惠化区的农业技术推广站干部，向农业社要了一块田来做，原定每亩一造包产六百五十斤。开始，他们还搞得不坏，但是插秧以后，他们上县去开会，一开十来天，农民的田插秧后已除了两次草，他们一次也没有除，农民不知道他们搞什么名堂，也不敢去帮助他们，结果这块田，每亩一造只收五百二十斤，赔了一百多斤稻谷。
    忠信区的农业技术推广站干部，采取了另一种作法，就是由他们出主意，和农业社合作，他们去开会的时候，有农业社帮助照顾，结果生产很好，一点三亩示范田，1955年每亩年产一千三百六十多斤，创造了全县最高的丰产纪录。
  今年春天，中共连平县委为了改变干部的领导作风，克服生产领导上一般化和官僚主义作风，根据党中央关于干部参加体力劳动的指示，作出了两条规定：一条是乡、社脱产干部必须有30％的时间参加体力劳动，县、区干部每月平均要有四至五天参加体力劳动；另一条就是和群众合作搞示范田，贯彻以生产指导生产。因此，从今春开始，从县委第一书记，到乡、社脱产干部，除了按照县委的指示，积极参加体力劳动外，普遍经营起示范田。忠信区平均每个干部经营三分示范田。
    由于示范田的生产采用了先进的耕作技术，得到了群众热情的支持和帮助，使先进的耕作技术和群众的经验结合了起来，因此今年早稻普遍获得了好收成。比如县委第一书记李明，在新东乡同区干部一起搞了七分多的示范田，由于提早插秧，增施了大量的有机质肥料，早稻收了六百多斤，比农业社的田增产一百多斤。县委书记朱远标和忠信区区委书记曾宏启、区干部吴启寿等一起，在官陂乡搞了一点七三亩示范田，今年早稻收成达一千零七十三斤，而去年这块田早稻只收了七百九十二斤。
    过去干部领导生产，多是听汇报，作一般号召，自己是一知半解，因此发出的号召很难说服群众，而且又往往不及时。参加示范田的生产，不但督促他们去钻研生产技术，熟悉农事季节，而且能够及时发现问题解决问题。比如忠信区区委书记，今年播种、育苗时期，发现自己搞的秧田秧苗突然发黄，他就找农业技术推广站的干部研究，才知道是追肥不及时，影响秧苗生长。他马上通知全区的农业社进行秧田检查，在这一推动下，全区及时展开了一个秧田追肥的运动，因此，今年早稻秧苗生长特别好。县委书记朱远标，过去听外县介绍经验，都说拔秧比铲秧好，能够增产，但是当地农民都不同意，自己也心中无数，不敢推广。今年春耕期间，他和区干部一起，在自己的示范田中拿出五分多田进行铲秧改拔秧的试验，果然这块拔秧的田的禾苗比周围铲秧的田长得好，群众来参观，都啧啧称赞。夏收时这块拔秧的田收了三百多斤，比铲秧的增产两成以上。官陂乡红星社的干部已经决定明年要把40％的田由铲秧改为拔秧。
    搞好示范田已经被连平县的干部做为领导生产的一条重要方法。他们在生产的重要关节，就先在自己的丰产田中做出榜样，然后组织参观评比，加以推广。官陂乡党支部书记兼红星社主任黄娘信和忠信区农业技术推广站的站长黄裕生合作搞了一块十亩左右的示范田，从播种、插秧到收割，全部采用先进的耕作技术，并且走在最前面，对推动社里技术改革起了很大作用。当地群众的习惯，第一次中耕追肥都是在插秧后十来天才进行，他们对于自己的示范田，在插秧后七天就开始第一次中耕追肥，然后组织群众观摩，事实证明及早中耕追肥确有好处，于是群众也跟着这样做。再如插秧后第一次追肥，过去群众不论肥田或瘦田，一律施用石灰。他们第一次改变了这种不合理的施肥习惯，根据这块沙质瘦田的特点，第一次追肥施用粪水，禾苗生长青壮，他们又组织观摩，因此群众也学会按照不同的土质施用粪水或石灰。黄娘信认为，搞示范田的确有很大好处，这一实践帮助他学习到了许多新的东西，比如抓紧季节，过去就体会不深，虽然天天在叫，但总觉得误过一、二天不要紧，现在自己比试一下，才知道相差一天禾苗生长就不一样。他还说，过去领导生产光动嘴，口水说干了，群众还不听；群众的习惯力量，一般号召是很难改变的，如果自己做出榜样，让群众看着做，那就好办得多了。
