Xinhua News Agency, Xining. Since the cadres of Houzihe Township, Xining City, implemented the working method of "office work done in the villages, meetings held in the fields, visits made to households," they have further strengthened the ties between cadres and the masses, and reduced the phenomena of busyness and procrastination in their work.

"Office work done in the villages" means that the township head and clerks go to the agricultural cooperatives to work regularly. The clerk goes to each cooperative once a week, and the township head once every half month. The nine cooperatives in the township are divided into two areas, and they patrol one area a day. Members can wait in the cooperative's office at the scheduled time to talk to the township cadres face-to-face, or they can ask the cooperative's accountant to register the problems that need to be solved. After the township cadres handle them, the accountant will convey them one by one. On October 6th and 7th, the clerks handled 41 matters, large and small, in the nine cooperatives. If each member spends half a day away from work to solve a matter at the township People's Committee, this week the cooperative members lost 20.5 workdays.

"Meetings held in the fields" means using rest time during production to hold cadre meetings or mass meetings in the fields. In July of this year, township and cooperative cadres held a two-day meeting in the fields of the Third Agricultural Cooperative to study the issue of rectifying the cooperatives throughout the township. They chatted while working and discussed during breaks. The work of rectifying the cooperatives was arranged well, and more than six mu of wheat fields were weeded.

"Visits made to households" take the following forms: township cadres often visit and have individual talks with the main cadres of the cooperatives; township and cooperative cadres visit members' homes at certain times regarding certain tasks; and visits for temporary incidents.

The masses say that the change in the cadres' work style has three advantages: "Less travel is good, timely handling of affairs is good, and not delaying production is good." The masses also praised the cadres for "using all their good intentions and thinking of all possible methods." The cadres also feel that they now grasp the situation faster and more thoroughly than in the past, and they are more confident in handling affairs.

### 下社办公　下地开会　下户访问  西宁后子河乡干部转变作风

    下社办公　下地开会　下户访问
    西宁后子河乡干部转变作风
    据新华社西宁电　西宁市后子河乡的干部自从实行“下社办公、下地开会、下户访问”的工作方法以来，进一步密切了干部与群众的联系，减少了工作中的忙乱现象和拖拉作风。
      “下社办公”就是乡长和文书定期到农业社办公。文书一星期到每个社一次，乡长半个月一次。全乡九个社分成两片，他们一天巡行一片地区。社员可以按时到社的办公室等候乡干部当面谈问题，也可以把需要解决的问题请社的会计员登记，乡干部处理后由会计一一传达。10月6、7两日，文书到九个社处理了大小事情四十一件，如果以每个人到乡人民委员会解决一件事情误工半天计，这一星期就使社员少误工二十个半。
      “下地开会”是利用生产中的休息时间，在地头开干部会或群众会。今年7月，乡、社干部在第三农业社的地里开了两天会研究全乡整社问题，他们在劳动中漫谈，在休息时讨论，整社工作布置好了，六亩多麦地的杂草也锄完了。
      “下户访问”有以下几种方式：乡干部经常到社的主要干部家去访问和个别谈话；乡、社干部在一定时间就某项工作到社员家中访问；临时性事件的访问。
    干部工作作风的转变，群众反映有三好：“少跑路好，办事及时好，不误生产好”。群众还称赞干部们“啥好心都用了，啥方法都想了。”干部们也感到现在掌握情况比过去快、多，办事也比较有把握。
