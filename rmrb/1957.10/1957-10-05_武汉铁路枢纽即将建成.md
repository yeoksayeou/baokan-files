    Wuhan Railway Hub Nears Completion
    The first phase of the Wuhan Railway Hub project is nearing completion, and it is expected to be fully delivered by October 15th when the Yangtze River Bridge opens to traffic.

    The new construction and renovation projects between Wuchang Station and Hankou Station, which must be completed before the opening of the Yangtze River Bridge, are now mostly finished. The tracks at Wuchang Station have been connected to the Yuehan Railway as planned. At Hanyang Station, the two newly built station tracks and the technical renovation project of the Yudaimen Station in Hankou have also been basically completed, and the original light rails have been replaced with heavy-duty steel rails.
