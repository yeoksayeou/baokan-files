We are very pleased to see that recently, the unity between socialist countries is constantly strengthening; the industrial and agricultural production and scientific and technological level of socialist countries are constantly developing and improving at a speed that capitalist countries cannot compare with. The strength and unity of the socialist countries are a major guarantee for our respective socialist construction and the maintenance of world peace. This is not only in the interests of our socialist countries, but also in the interests of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. The Chinese people will continue to work with the fraternal Czechoslovak people and all other socialist countries to continuously strengthen the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and to continuously strengthen the unity of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world."
