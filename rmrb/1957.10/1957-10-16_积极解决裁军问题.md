　　Actively Resolve the Issue of Disarmament
    The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has begun discussing the issue of disarmament. This issue is listed as the committee's top agenda item, which is not accidental, because disarmament is currently the most concerning issue for people around the world, and the recent new developments in science and technology have further increased the importance and urgency of this issue.
    The Soviet Union's launched artificial satellite has orbited the earth more than a hundred times, and its operation is completely in accordance with pre-calculated figures. This epoch-making creation of the Soviet Union marks the beginning of mankind's conquest of the universe. This shows how much of a miracle mankind can create when it uses its wisdom and technology to control and transform nature. It also shows how serious a danger it can bring to the world if the arms race continues in today's rapidly changing science and technology. Science has affirmed with its authority that countries of the world can only follow the path of peaceful coexistence. The most urgent issue in the international community today is that all countries, especially the major powers with strong armed forces, immediately reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament, especially on the issue of stopping nuclear testing and prohibiting nuclear weapons.
    The Soviet Union has once again issued a call for comprehensive disarmament at the Political Committee, and in order to promote the cessation of the arms race, it suggested that a preliminary agreement be reached on preliminary measures of disarmament first, including the immediate cessation of nuclear testing for two or three years, the conclusion of a five-year agreement to prohibit the use of atomic weapons, the reduction of the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France of their troops stationed in Germany and other foreign countries, the agreement on methods of abolishing foreign military bases, not stationing atomic forces and storing atomic weapons on foreign territories, and the establishment of appropriate supervision. The Soviet Union's proposal focuses on the most urgent issues of the moment, and puts forward the most basic and practical measures. As long as the Western countries agree to these preliminary measures, the issue of disarmament can take an important first step, which can greatly ease international tensions, reduce the threat of new wars and the danger of nuclear testing, so as to initially meet the most urgent desires of the people all over the world.
    The Soviet Union actively seeks a disarmament agreement, as Comrade Khrushchev recently emphasized once again, is by no means out of weakness and fear of imperialism. After the Soviet Union announced the successful completion of the intercontinental ballistic missile launch test, Western countries, especially the military and political leaders of the United States, tried their best to spread an atmosphere of suspicion, wanting to dilute the significance of this event. However, the Soviet Union then successfully launched the first artificial satellite. This indisputably confirms the Soviet Union's enormous capabilities in projection technology, even exceeding the intercontinental scope. The United States is the only country in the capitalist world that is close to possessing this technology, but whether it is in artificial satellites or intercontinental missiles, even according to the plans they officially promote, it will take several more months to several years to successfully launch them. The Soviet Union's definite leading position in the latest military science and industrial technology is enough to show that the Soviet Union's position on the issue of disarmament is not out of weakness, but out of a confident advantage. The sincerity and humanitarian nature of the socialist countries' peaceful foreign policy is also confirmed here.
    In fact, it is precisely the Western imperialist countries, headed by the United States, that have consistently carried out military intimidation. They pursue a policy of atomic blackmail, on the pretext of preventing "the threat of Soviet aggression"; they launched a large-scale nuclear arms race, insisting that the "security" of Western countries requires maintaining a military advantage. Now the development of the situation has exposed this Goebbels-style lie.
    After the war, the United States maintained a monopoly on the atomic bomb for several years. But when the hydrogen bomb appeared, the United States' monopoly was lost. Subsequently, the Soviet Union took the lead in the latest science and technology, such as long-range jet propulsion aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and artificial satellites, one after another. This development not only bankrupted the so-called "deterrence theory" that serves as the cornerstone of the Western imperialist foreign policy, but also shows that their hope of gaining some kind of monopoly advantage again is very slim. This is why the success of the Soviet Union's launch of the Earth satellite has caused such obvious frustration and despair among the Western ruling groups.
    Of course, we cannot have any illusions about the conscience of the imperialist bloc. They make fortunes through the arms race, and are obsessed with plundering and enslaving other countries, so they will never willingly agree to disarmament and easing international tensions. In addition to showing panic over the Soviet Union's leading position, the imperialists are trying their best to create a new arms expansion hysteria and add new arguments to their continued arms race. US Secretary of State Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly, US Representative Lodge's speech at the Political Committee meeting, and British Prime Minister Macmillan's speech at the British Conservative Party Congress are some evidences of this. Compelled by the strong emotions of the people all over the world, they have to talk more about disarmament, but in fact they still advocate the so-called "position of strength" policy of Western countries, and try to keep disarmament negotiations on its entangled old path. They stubbornly insist on their so-called "joint proposal" put forward in the London disarmament talks, and attempt to mobilize the moral force of the United Nations to support their position of obstructing disarmament. The "core" of this "joint proposal" - in Dulles' own words - is the so-called "open skies" plan. This plan can only help collect military intelligence and increase mutual suspicion, and cannot have any positive effect on disarmament. Especially when rocket weapons are increasingly developing, the impracticality of this plan is even more obvious. On the other hand, the "joint proposal" avoids such most critical issues as the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and the destruction of existing atomic weapons, the withdrawal of troops stationed in foreign countries and the elimination of foreign military bases, and the unconditional cessation of nuclear testing. In fact, Western countries have clearly expressed their intention to retain the right to use, continue to develop and manufacture atomic weapons. They fundamentally refuse to negotiate the issue of foreign troops and bases, and on the easiest and most feasible issue of stopping nuclear testing, they are unwilling to undertake longer-term obligations. Refusing to take the first step in practical and feasible aspects, while insisting on the "aerial inspection" method that can only cause disputes in the current situation, is proof that Western countries do not want to reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament. In order to facilitate the continued obstruction of the agreement, they also refuse to expand the Disarmament Subcommittee and change the method of negotiating behind closed doors by this subcommittee. And the lack of balance and full representation in the composition of this committee, as well as its secret negotiation methods, have proven to be only conducive to the imperialist forces obstructing disarmament agreements.
    Disarmament, especially the elimination of nuclear threats, is the most important task before this session of the United Nations General Assembly. In addition to the Soviet Union, other countries such as India and Japan have also put forward proposals on the issue of eliminating nuclear threats. The responsibility of the General Assembly lies in making a fair judgment on the two opposing positions of the Soviet Union's active pursuit of an agreement and the Western countries' multiple obstructions to disarmament, and promoting the resolution of the issue of disarmament. This is also the unshirkable responsibility of just public opinion all over the world.

### 积极解决裁军问题

　　积极解决裁军问题
    联合国大会政治委员会已开始讨论裁军问题。这个问题被列为委员会的头号议程，这并不是偶然的，因为裁军是全世界人民当前最关心的问题，而最近科学技术方面的新发展，更增加了这个问题的重要性和迫切性。
    苏联发射的人造卫星已经绕地球转了一百多周，它的运行完全符合于事先的计算。苏联的这一划时代的创造，标志着人类征服宇宙的开端。这说明，当人类把它的智慧和技术用来控制和改造自然的时候，它能够创造出多大的奇迹。这同时也表明，如果军备竞赛继续下去，在科学技术日新月异的今天，它可以给世界带来多么严重的危险。科学以它的权威肯定了，世界各国只能够走和平共处的道路。当前国际上最迫切的问题，就是各国，首先是拥有强大武装力量的各大国之间，立即就裁军问题，首先是停止核试验和禁止核武器问题，达成协议。
    苏联已在政治委员会上又一次发出了全面裁军的呼吁，并且为了促成停止军备竞赛，建议首先就裁军的初步措施达成协议，包括立即停止核试验两三年，缔结一项为期五年的禁止使用原子武器的协议，苏美英法四国减少它们驻在德国和其他外国的军队，商定取消国外军事基地的办法，不在外国领土上驻扎原子部队和贮存原子武器，建立相当的监督。苏联的建议集中在当前最迫切的问题上，而且提出了最起码的切实可行的办法。只要西方国家同意这些初步措施，裁军问题就能迈出重要的第一步，就能够大大缓和国际的紧张局势，减轻新战争的威胁和核试验的危险，从而初步满足全世界人民最迫切的愿望。
    苏联积极谋求裁军协议，如赫鲁晓夫同志最近又一次强调指出的，绝不是出于软弱和害怕帝国主义。在苏联宣布顺利地完成洲际弹道导弹的发射试验之后，西方国家特别是美国的军政首脑曾经竭力散布怀疑的气氛，想冲淡这一事件的意义。但是，接着苏联又成功地射出了第一颗人造卫星。这无可争辩地确证了苏联在投射技术方面的巨大能力甚至已超出了洲际的范畴。美国是资本主义世界里唯一接近于拥有这种技术的国家，但是它无论是在人造卫星或是洲际导弹方面，即使按照他们官方所宣传的计划，要能成功地发射也得再过几个月到几年的时间。苏联在最新的军事科学和工业技术方面肯定的领先地位足以说明，苏联在裁军问题上的立场不是出于软弱，倒是出于一种有把握的优势。社会主义国家的和平外交政策的真诚和人道性质，从这里也得到了证实。
    实际上，一贯进行军事恫吓的正是以美国为首的西方帝国主义国家，它们推行原子讹诈政策，借口是防止“苏联侵略的威胁”；它们发动大规模的核军备竞赛，硬说西方国家的“安全”要求保有军事上的优势。现在形势的发展戳穿了这种戈培尔式的谎言。
    战后，美国曾经保持了几年的原子弹垄断。但是在氢弹出现时，美国的垄断权就丧失了。接着，苏联在远程喷气推进飞机、洲际弹道导弹、人造卫星等最新科学技术方面，接二连三地遥遥领先。这种发展不但使得作为西方帝国主义外交政策之基石的所谓“威慑论”归于破产，而且说明它们想要再取得某种垄断优势的希望也是很渺茫了。这就是为什么苏联发射地球卫星的成功在西方国家统治集团中引起了那样明显的沮丧和绝望的情绪。
    当然，对帝国主义集团的良知，不能够存有任何幻想。他们靠军备竞赛发财，醉心于掠夺和奴役别的国家，因此它们决不会心甘情愿地同意裁军和缓和国际紧张局势。在对苏联的领先地位表现惊慌之余，帝国主义者正在竭力制造一阵新的扩军歇斯底里，并为他们继续军备竞赛加添新的辩辞。美国国务卿杜勒斯在联合国大会上的演说，美国代表洛奇在政治委员会会议上的发言，英国首相麦克米伦在英国保守党大会上的讲话，就是这方面的一些证据。迫于全世界人民的强烈情绪，他们不得不更多地谈论裁军，但是实际上他们仍然鼓吹西方国家的所谓“实力地位”政策，并力图把裁军谈判保持在它的纠缠不清的老路上。他们顽固地坚持他们在伦敦裁军谈判中提出的所谓“联合建议”，并且企图动员联合国的道义力量来支持他们阻挠裁军的立场。这个“联合建议”的
  “核心”——用杜勒斯自己的说法——就是所谓“开放天空”计划。这种计划只能帮助搜集军事情报和增加相互猜疑，对于裁军不可能有任何积极的作用。特别是在火箭武器日益发展的时候，这种计划之不切实际更为明显。另一方面，“联合建议”却规避了这样一些最关键的问题，即禁止使用原子武器和销毁已有的原子武器的问题，撤退在外国的驻军和消除国外军事基地问题，无条件停止核试验问题。事实上西方国家已经明确地表示要保留使用、继续发展和制造原子武器的权利。它们根本拒绝谈判国外驻军和基地的问题，在最简单易行的停止核试验问题上，它们也不愿承担较长期的义务。拒绝在切实可行的方面开步走，而坚持在目前状况下只能引起纠纷的“空中视察”办法，就是西方国家不想就裁军问题达成协议的证明。为了便于继续阻挠协议，它们还拒绝扩大裁军小组委员会，改变由这个小组委员会关起门来谈判的办法。而这个委员会的组成上的缺乏平衡和充分代表性，以及它的秘密谈判方法，已经证明只有利于帝国主义势力阻挠裁军协议。
    裁军，特别是消除核威胁，是摆在本届联合国大会面前的最重要任务。除了苏联以外，其他国家如印度和日本，也就消除核威胁问题提出了建议。大会的责任在于，对苏联的积极谋求协议和西方国家的多方阻挠裁军这两种相反的立场，作出正义的裁判，促进裁军问题的解决。这也是全世界公正舆论义不容辞的责任。
