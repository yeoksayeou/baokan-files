Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th - Since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan in 1928, the Soviet Union has invested approximately 1.8 trillion rubles (calculated according to the prices on July 1, 1955, the same below) in construction in various fields.

From 1929 to the present, the Soviet Union has built and restored an average of about three large industrial enterprises and about ten kilometers of main and branch railway lines every day. In addition, more than 5,000 state farms and about 9,000 machine tractor stations have been established during this period.

The Soviet Union's large-scale investment in construction only began during the First Five-Year Plan. Since then, its growth rate has been particularly rapid. In the ten years from 1918, the total basic investment of the Soviet Union was only 15.7 billion rubles, an average of more than 1.5 billion per year; during the First Five-Year Plan from 1928, it increased to 61.6 billion, an average of 14.5 billion per year; and during the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), this figure rose to 629.3 billion, an average of 125.1 billion per year. Basic investment in 1956 increased further to 180 billion rubles.

Most of the basic investment is used for industrial construction. Industry accounted for more than 60% of the basic investment in the first to fifth five-year plans. In recent years, investment in agriculture has increased significantly. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, which ended in 1955, agricultural investment increased to 2.5 times that of the Fourth Five-Year Plan; the Sixth Five-Year Plan increased to twice that of the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

Over the past ten years, the proportion of construction costs in investment has decreased from 70% to 59%, while equipment costs have increased from 26% to 35%.

In the large-scale economic construction, the distribution of Soviet productive forces has undergone fundamental changes. Before the October Revolution, two-thirds of Russia's industrial output was concentrated in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Ivanovo, and Ukraine. The industrial development of the eastern regions of the Soviet Union only began after the October Revolution. In 1955, 60% of the Soviet Union's oil, one-half of its coal, steel, and steel products, and 40% of its electricity were produced in the eastern regions.

In 1913, Western Siberia produced only 800,000 tons of coal, which increased to more than 66 million tons last year. The Urals produced 17.5 million tons of steel last year, while production was less than one million tons before the revolution. The industrial output of Kazakhstan and Central Asia has now exceeded that of pre-revolutionary Russia, and the electricity they generate is equivalent to five times the electricity generated by Russia in 1913.

In the past thirty years, the Soviet Union has established more than 800 new cities. In 1926, there were only three cities in Russia with a population of more than 500,000 and only twenty-eight with a population of more than 100,000, but now the number of such cities has increased to twenty-two and one hundred and thirteen respectively.

　　苏联基本建设投资迅速增加
    每天平均新建和修复三个大型工业企业
    新华社莫斯科18日电  从1928年开始执行第一个五年计划到现在，苏联已经在各方面的建设中投入了约一万八千亿卢布（按1955年7月1日价格计算，下同）的资金。
    从1929年到现在，苏联平均每天新建和修复约三个大型工业企业，约十公里铁路干线和支线。此外，在这期间还建立了五千多个国营农场和约九千个机器拖拉机站。
    苏联在建设方面进行大规模的投资是在第一个五年计划期间才开始的。从此以后它的增长速度特别迅速。在从1918年起的十年中，苏联的基本投资总共只有一百五十七亿卢布，每年平均十五亿多；在从1928年起的第一个五年计划期间就增加到六百一十六亿，每年平均一百四十五亿；而在第五个五年计划（1951—1955年）期间，这个数字就上升到六千二百九十三亿，每年平均一千二百五十一亿。1956年的基本投资又增加到了一千八百亿卢布。
    基本投资大部分用在工业建设方面。在第一个到第五个五年计划的基本投资中，工业占60％以上。最近几年来，农业投资大大增加了。在1955年结束的第五个五年计划期间，农业投资增加为第四个五个计划的二点五倍；第六个五年计划增加为第五个五年计划的两倍。
    过去十年中，建筑费用在投资中所占的比重已经由70％下降到59％，设备费用由26％上升到35％。
    在大规模的经济建设中，苏联生产力的分布情况发生了根本的变化。十月革命前，俄国工业产量有三分之二集中在莫斯科、彼得堡、伊凡诺沃和乌克兰。苏联东部地区的工业发展是在十月革命后才开始的。1955年，苏联全国已经有60％的石油，二分之一的煤、钢和钢材，40％的电力是在东部地区生产的。
    1913年，西西伯利亚只生产了八十万吨煤，去年就增加到六千六百多万吨。乌拉尔去年生产了一千七百五十万吨钢，而在革命前生产量还不到一百万吨。哈萨克和中亚细亚的工业产量现在已经超过了革命前的俄国，它们所发出的电力相当于1913年俄国发电量的五倍。
    在过去的三十年中，苏联建立了八百多个新的城市。1926年，俄国城市的人口超过五十万的只有三个，超过十万的只有二十八个，现在这样的城市分别增加到二十二个和一百一十三个。
