    Heartfelt Congratulations on the Epoch-Making Innovation of Soviet Scientists
    Tu Changwang, Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau
    On October 4th, Soviet scientists successfully launched the first artificial satellite according to the plan of the International Geophysical Year. This is an epoch-making event in the history of science. I felt very excited and proud when I saw this news. I am excited because mankind's dream of conquering the universe has finally been initially realized, and I am proud because our Soviet大哥 (Big Brother) has achieved an absolute victory in this scientific competition. The United States has made long-term preparations and publicity in the field of artificial satellites, but it was the Soviet Union, not the United States, that successfully launched the first artificial satellite in history. This once again shows that the Soviet Union's achievements in science and technology have surpassed the United States.
    Launching an artificial satellite is a very complex scientific and technological problem. It is impossible to achieve this success without mastering the world's highest achievements in science and technology. To successfully launch an artificial satellite, it is necessary to first solve a series of complex and difficult problems. For example: First, there must be a powerful rocket that can launch the artificial satellite to a high altitude of more than 300 kilometers above the ground. After reaching an altitude of more than 300 kilometers, the artificial satellite must also obtain an astonishing speed of about 28,000 kilometers per hour. Second, it is necessary to solve the alloy materials that can withstand high temperatures and high speeds (the combustion temperature of new rockets can reach over 3,000 degrees Celsius. When the rocket's speed in the atmosphere reaches 8,000 kilometers per hour, the temperature of the rocket's surface can reach about 1,000 degrees Celsius due to friction with the air). Third, it is necessary to solve the complex radio technology that can manipulate and control high-speed flying rockets. Fourth, it is necessary to solve various scientific recording and transmitting instruments that can withstand high speeds, vibrations (caused by satellite collisions with meteors), and extreme temperature changes.
    This great innovation of Soviet scientists shows that Soviet scientists have completely solved and mastered these complex scientific and technological problems. The Soviet Union was the first to build an atomic energy power station, the first to complete the test of intercontinental missiles, and now the first to successfully launch the first artificial satellite. All these show that only under the superior socialist system can science and technology develop rapidly. Let me once again heartily congratulate the Soviet scientists on their epoch-making great contribution!

    衷心祝贺苏联科学家划时代的创举
    中央气象局局长　涂长望
    苏联科学家于10月4日按照国际地球物理年的计划，成功地发射了第一个人造卫星，这是科学史上划时代的一件大事，我看到了这个消息感到非常兴奋和骄傲。兴奋的是因为人类征服宇宙的梦想终于初步的实现了，骄傲的是因为我们的苏联老大哥在这一次科学竞赛中取得了绝对的胜利。美国在人造卫星方面作了长时间的准备和宣传，但成功地发射历史上第一个人造卫星的是苏联而不是美国。这件事又一次的说明了苏联在科学和技术上的成就是超过了美国。
    发射人造卫星是非常复杂的科学和技术问题，没有掌握世界上科学和技术方面的最高成就，是不可能得到这次成功的。要成功地发射人造卫星是必须首先解决一系列复杂和困难的问题。举例来说：首先，要有能够把人造卫星发射到离地面三百公里以上的高空的强大火箭，到达了三百公里以上的高度以后还必须使人造卫星获得每小时二万八千公里左右的惊人速度。第二，要解决能够耐高温和高速的合金材料（新型火箭的燃烧的温度可以达到摄氏三千度以上。火箭在大气中的速度每小时达到八千公里时，因与空气摩擦火箭外表的温度可以达到摄氏一千度左右）。第三，要解决能操纵控制高速度飞行火箭的复杂的无线电技术。第四，要解决能够耐高速度，耐震动（卫星与流星碰撞所产生的），耐极端温度变化的各种科学记录与发报仪器。
    苏联科学家这一伟大的创举，说明了苏联的科学家已完全解决和掌握了这些复杂的科学技术问题。苏联首先建成原子能发电站，又首先完成洲际导弹的试验，现在又首先成功地发射了第一个人造卫星。这些都说明了只有在社会主义的优越制度下，科学和技术才能得到飞速的发展。让我再一次衷心地祝贺苏联科学家们的划时代的伟大贡献！
