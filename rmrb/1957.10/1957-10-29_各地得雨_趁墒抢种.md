    Rain in Various Places, Seize the Moisture and Rush to Plant
    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, October 27th dispatch) Shaanxi's central and southern regions continued to receive welcome rain on the 25th and 26th. At present, the moisture from the rainfall has reached the subsoil in most areas, alleviating the threat of drought. This is extremely beneficial for the continued sowing and emergence of wheat, barley, lentils, vetch and other small summer crops. Wheat fields that could not be plowed and sown in the past due to dry and hard soil can now be sown. Wheat fields that have already been sown but have uneven emergence can continue to sprout after the rain. Wheat fields with severe gaps and broken rows can be re-sown while the soil is moist. In order to complete the sowing of wheat and small summer crops in a timely manner and prevent complacency regarding drought resistance and moisture conservation, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture issued a notice on the 25th, calling on farmers throughout the province to mobilize urgently, seize the moisture and rush to plant wheat, and work hard to check and replant seedlings and prepare the land for moisture conservation, to ensure fast, sufficient, and high-quality planting, and to guarantee full and vigorous seedlings, laying a solid foundation for a bumper summer harvest next year. At present, agricultural cooperatives in various places have been actively mobilized to rush planting and replanting.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 28th dispatch) Jiangsu Province has received widespread rainfall, and the drought situation has eased. Members of agricultural cooperatives are working hard in the rain to rush planting, and the sowing progress has been greatly accelerated. From the afternoon of the 27th, the rainfall in the Xuzhou area was 10 to 15 millimeters, and the rainfall in the Huaiyin area was about 18 millimeters. The rainfall in the Lixiahe area was 20 to 25 millimeters, and the drought has been basically relieved. There has also been light rain in southern Jiangsu.
    The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture urgently notified all localities to seize the good opportunity of moist soil after the rain and rush to plant wheat. It is required that the 5 million mu of wheat fields in silted land and mountainous areas that cannot be cultivated due to lack of water sources should be rushed to be planted within two or three days. Those that have been sown but have uneven emergence should be replanted in time, requiring each mu of wheat field to reach 200,000 seedlings.
    It is still raining lightly in Jiangsu.
    (Xinhua News Agency, October 27th dispatch) From the afternoon of the 24th to the morning of the 26th, welcome rain fell widely in various parts of Henan Province.
    Now, leadership organs at all levels are leading farmers to seize the moisture and rush to plant. The Provincial People's Committee has issued instructions for rushing to plant. Special districts such as Luoyang held telephone conferences, requiring the organization of all forces to seize the moisture and rush to plant. Nanyang, Xinxiang and other special districts, where wheat sowing has been completed relatively quickly, not only require completing the sowing plan while the soil is moist, but also to replant seedlings. Wheat fields with 70% missing seedlings should be re-sown.
    (Xinhua News Agency, October 27th dispatch) From 8:00 am on the 24th to 8:00 pm on the 27th, Gansu, central and southern Shaanxi, southern Shanxi, Henan, western Shandong, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Anhui and other provinces have successively received rain. Among them, the rainfall in Hunan, Sichuan, Guizhou and other provinces for three days was 30 to 60 millimeters.

    各地得雨　趁墒抢种
    本报西安27日电　陕西中部和南部地区25日和26日继续降喜雨。目前大部分地区雨水渗透的湿土都接上底墒，已经解除了干旱的威胁，这对小麦和大麦、扁豆、菀豆等小夏田作物的继续播种和出苗极为有利。过去由于土地干硬不能翻犁和播种的麦田现在可以播种了，已经播种，但是由于干旱出苗不齐的麦田，雨后可以继续出苗，对缺苗、断条较严重的麦田还可乘墒补种。为了及时完成小麦和小夏田作物的播种任务，防止对抗旱保墒的松劲情绪，陕西省农业厅已于25日发出通知，号召全省农民紧急动员起来，趁墒突击种麦，抓紧查苗补苗和整地保墒工作，做到种快、种够、种好，保证苗全、苗旺，为明年夏田丰收打好基础。目前，各地农业社已经积极动员起来，一面抢种，一面补种。
    新华社南京28日电　江苏省普遍得雨，旱象缓和。农业社社员们正紧张地冒雨抢种，播种进度大大加快。从27日下午起，徐州专区降雨量十至十五公厘，淮阴专区降雨量十八公厘左右。里下河地区降雨量二十至二十五公厘，旱象已基本解除。苏南地区也都下了小雨。
    江苏省农业厅紧急通知各地，抓紧雨后泥土湿润的良好时机，抢种麦子。要求淤土地和山区因缺水源而无法耕种的五百万亩麦田，在两三天内突击完成抢种。已播种但出苗不齐的应及时补种，要求每亩麦田达到二十万苗。
    现在，江苏地区仍在下小雨。
    据新华社27日讯　河南省各地24日下午至26日上午普降喜雨。
    现在各级领导机关，正在领导农民趁墒抢种。省人民委员会发出了抢种指示。洛阳等专区召开了电话会议，要求组织一切力量，趁墒抢种。麦播完成较快的南阳、新乡等专区，不但要求趁墒完成播种计划，而且要进行补苗，缺苗70％的麦田要进行重种。
    据新华社27日讯　从24日早晨八时到27日晚八时止，甘肃、陕西中部和南部，山西南部，河南、山东西部，四川、贵州、湖南、湖北、江西、广西、安徽等省都先后下了雨。其中湖南、四川、贵州等省三天的降雨量有三十到六十公厘。
