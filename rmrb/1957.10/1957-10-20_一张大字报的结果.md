　　The Result of a Big-Character Poster

　　During the rectification campaign, workers at the Chengdu Food Factory posted a big-character poster criticizing the factory's clinic, stating that the dispensing window was too high off the ground, making it inconvenient to get medicine. The factory's work improvement group immediately took measures and built three earthen steps under the dispensing window. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Zhongjing (Photo attached)
