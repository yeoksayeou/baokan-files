Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Recently, the leading organs of the People's Liberation Army stationed in various regions received many letters from township cadres, reflecting that during the period when the troops and soldiers were conducting socialist ideological education in the countryside, they wrote letters to educate their families, which played a certain role.

Some township cadres wrote in their letters that before and after the socialist debate unfolded in the countryside, many military families received letters from their children in the army, some receiving three or four in a row. The military families attached great importance to the opinions of their children.

Many letters from township cadres praised the troops and soldiers for using the achievements of socialist construction they had seen with their own eyes to vividly and practically explain the correctness of various policies to their families. Some soldiers also compared the new and old societies, compared the suffering of their parents and brothers in the past with the current situation, and explained that agricultural collectivization is the only way for peasants to become prosperous together. The letters sent by the troops and soldiers to their hometowns showed their high socialist consciousness and firm stance, and the opinions they put forward were very persuasive, thus helping their families to distinguish right from wrong and firmly follow the path of socialist cooperation. For example, the father of soldier Huang Shixian from a certain unit reversed his temporary idea of withdrawing from the cooperative under the education of Huang Shixian's letter. Zhu Jinhu, a friend of Private Xu Renlin, also wrote back to Xu Renlin, telling him that he would stand firm in the struggle and strive to become an activist. Sergeant Squad Leader Wang Wenqi's elder brother wrote to him and assured him: "We will definitely sell more surplus grain to the country and打击打击右派分子!"

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 14th: The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers are very concerned about the socialist ideological education movement in their hometowns and have written letters to educate their relatives to resolutely follow the socialist road. Many soldiers told reporters that they expressed their opinions on issues such as agricultural collectivization, unified purchase and supply, and the relationship between workers and peasants in their letters, hoping that their relatives would firmly defend the socialist position in the great debate and forever follow the Communist Party. Gunner Wang Qing wrote in a letter to his family: "Before liberation, our family of six worked like cattle and horses for the landlord, and we did not have a single grain of harvest. We lived on bran, chaff, and wild vegetables all year round, and my mother often fainted from hunger. The days of suffering can never be forgotten. Since liberation, especially since collectivization, the whole family has not worried about food and clothing. Some landlords and rich peasants slander socialism as bad, so you should use these facts to tear off their masks!" Soldier Wang Lu said in a letter to his family that when his hometown suffered a famine the year before last, wasn't it because the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and supply and transported grain from the areas with good harvests that prevented our village from having anyone go hungry or flee the famine? If it had been before liberation, how many people would have wandered to other places? Those who slander the policy of unified purchase and supply actually do not want socialism. In a letter to his father, Private He Liangfu hoped that his father would not only actively participate in the debate himself, but also help the members of the cooperative to keep their eyes open and resolutely fight against capitalist ideas.

    坚守社会主义阵地　永远跟着共产党走
    部队官兵写信教育家属分清是非
    许多乡干部致函各地驻军领导机关大加赞扬
    新华社14日讯　最近，中国人民解放军各地驻军领导机关收到许多乡干部的来信，反映部队官兵在农村进行社会主义思想教育期间，纷纷写信教育家属，起了一定的作用。
    有的乡干部的来信上写道，在农村展开社会主义大辩论前后，许多军人家属都接到了子弟从部队寄来的信，有的接连收到三、四封。军人家属们都十分重视他们的子弟的意见。
    许多乡干部的来信，赞扬部队官兵用亲眼看到的社会主义建设的成就，生动而实际地向家庭说明各项政策的正确。有些士兵还拿新、旧社会作对比，拿父母兄弟过去受的苦跟今天的情况作对比，讲明农业合作化是农民共同走向富裕的唯一道路。部队官兵寄到家乡的书信中，都表现了他们的社会主义觉悟很高，立场很坚定，而且提出的意见很有说服力，从而帮助家里人分清了是非，坚定地走社会主义合作化的道路。如某部战士黄世贤的父亲就在黄世贤来信的教育下扭转了一时想退社的思想。上等兵徐仁林的朋友朱金虎也回信告诉徐仁林，他要在斗争中站稳立场，争取当积极分子。中士班长王文崎的哥哥写信向他保证：“我们一定多卖余粮给国家，打击右派分子！”
    新华社平壤14日电　中国人民志愿军广大官兵十分关怀家乡的社会主义思想教育运动，纷纷写信教育亲属坚决走社会主义道路。许多战士对记者说，他们在信中就农业合作化、统购统销、工农关系等问题发表了意见，希望亲人在大辩论中坚守社会主义阵地，永远跟着共产党走。炮手王清在家信中写道：“解放前，咱家六口人给地主干牛马活，自己没有颗粒的收获，终年靠糠、麸、野菜生活，妈妈常饿得昏厥。苦难的日子永远不能忘记。解放以后，特别是合作化以来，全家不愁吃穿。有些地主、富农污蔑社会主义不好，你们就用这些事实剥开他们的鬼脸吧！”战士王禄在家信中说，前年家乡闹灾荒，不是因为国家实行了统购统销政策，把丰收地区的粮食运来，才使我村没有一个挨饿和逃荒的吗？如果在解放前，不知要有多少人流浪到外地呢？那些污蔑统购统销政策的人，实际是不要社会主义。上等兵何良福在写给他的父亲的信中，希望他的父亲不仅自己要积极参加辩论，还要帮助社员擦亮眼睛，向资本主义思想作坚决斗争。
