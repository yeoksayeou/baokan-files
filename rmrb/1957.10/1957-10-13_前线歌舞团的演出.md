The Frontline Song and Dance Troupe is very familiar to me. It possesses a strong creative force. The deeply moving and unforgettable "Huaihai Campaign Suite" is an excellent work collectively created by its composers.

This time, for the great national holiday of the motherland—National Day—they brought the fruits of their hard work over the past few years to the audience in the capital as the best gift. I went to listen twice and got a clear impression: the creation is becoming more and more mature. The style of some works is very clear, and the artistic skills have also been improved. I know that this is the result of their in-depth understanding of the new life and hard artistic training.

I think the choral part is more prominent in the music program. Among them, Shen Yawei's "Yuhuatai" and Luo Xin et al.'s "East China Sea Victory Song" are more successful. The chorus "Yuhuatai" expresses the people's tragic and painful emotions in memory of the martyrs, and also reflects the people's hatred for the atrocities of the reactionaries. The theme melody first led by the bass part has a distinct image, and the subsequent four-part mixed chorus shows an infinitely solemn atmosphere and a slightly suppressed emotion. The fifth section, "From now on, plant roses on the green hills," is bright and beautiful, with a strong folk music style, and the counterpoint is also used very well. This plays a significant role in the emotional change of the whole song. It renders the optimistic spirit of the people after liberation, so the music contrasts with the last slightly heavy section, which strengthens the moving power of the entire piece. However, the middle two sections are somewhat lacking in style and are not very harmonious with the front and back, seeming too confined to traditional European handling methods. At the same time, there are also shortcomings in the combination of melody and lyrics in some places. For example, the repetition of the sentence "The iron cavalry broke into the Presidential Palace" uses the same tone to compose these eight words with different pronunciations and intonations, which is worth considering.

Another large chorus, "East China Sea Victory Song," is full of the colors of folk music in the Jiangnan area. Although the "Sea Defense Soldiers Training Busily" inserted in the middle with a queue style and the march-style "Three Armies Strongly Attack Yijiangshan" do not appear to be unharmonious in style, they make people feel a dramatic effect. However, the male baritone solo section, although it has the nature of a recitative, the melody has a loose and lengthy feeling. The harmony is relatively weak, and the tonal layout lacks change. I especially like the female chorus "Pine Seeds," which is simple, sincere, and touching. Other choruses also have their own characteristics. The male quartet "Sailors Return to the Coast" is also very lyrical and interesting. "Five Cooks" is a common humorous expression technique in recent years, but it does not fall into clichés and can achieve a certain effect.

In terms of singing, the voices of each part of the choir are quite even, and the timbre is also very harmonious, but in many places the lyrics cannot be heard clearly, which is worth noting. Folk song quartets and female duets are also quite beautiful. He Yanchang's male solo performance has good skills, and the control of sound intensity is also cultivated. The songs he sings are also one of the popular programs.

What is particularly worth mentioning is "Zhoushan Gong and Drum" (folk music from eastern Zhejiang). This program uses eleven gongs of different sizes as a solo instrument, accompanied by a folk orchestra. It has rich images and distinct colors. This is a very original program and is also the most popular program. If the solo part can be better developed and the soloist's skills can be improved, it will receive a more moving effect.

　　前线歌舞团的演出

    前线歌舞团我是很熟悉的，它拥有较强的创作力量。那令人深深感动而难以忘怀的“淮海战役组歌”就是它的作曲家们集体创作出来的优秀作品。
    这一次，他们为祖国伟大的节日——国庆节，给首都观众带来几年来辛勤劳动的果实，作为最好的献礼。我去听了两次，获得了一个鲜明的印象，创作越来越成熟了。有一些作品的风格非常明朗，艺术技巧也更提高了。我知道这是他们深入理解新的生活和努力艺术锻炼的结果。
    我以为在音乐节目中合唱部分是比较突出的。其中比较成功的是沈亚威的“雨花台”和洛辛等的“东海凯歌”。“雨花台”这个合唱表达了人民悼念先烈们的悲壮而又沉痛的情绪，同时也反映了人民对于反动派暴行的仇恨的心情。低音部首先导出的主题旋律具有鲜明的形象，以后的四部混声合唱表现出无限庄严肃穆的气氛和稍带压抑的情感。第五段“从此青山种蔷薇”一段开朗优美，有浓厚的民间音乐的风格，在复调方面也用得很出色。这对全曲的情绪变化起了显著的作用，它渲染了解放后人民那种乐观主义的精神，因此和最后稍嫌沉重的一段，音乐起了对比的效果，加强了整个乐曲的感人力量。但是中间两段在风格上有所欠缺，与前后显得不甚调和，似乎太拘泥于欧洲传统的处理手法。同时在某些地方曲调和歌词的结合也有缺点，比如“铁骑突进了总统府”一句的重复，完全用同一个音来谱这八个语音和语调都不同的字，是值得考虑的。
    另外一个大合唱“东海凯歌”充满了江南一带的民间音乐的色彩，虽然是中间插入了队列风的“海防战士练兵忙”和进行曲风的“三军强攻一江山”也不显得风格上的不调和，反而使人感到戏剧性的效果，但男中音独唱一段虽然有宣叙的性质但曲调有松散和冗长的感觉。在和声方面比较平弱，调性布局也嫌缺少变化。我特别喜欢女声合唱“马尾松籽”，情感朴质真诚，动人心弦。其他的合唱也各有特色。男声小合唱“水兵回到海岸上”也很抒情有趣。“五个炊事兵”虽然是最近几年带诙谐性的一般的表现手法，但也不落陈套，能够获得一定的效果。
    在演唱方面，合唱队各声部相当匀称，音色也很协和，只是有许多地方听不清唱词，值得注意。民歌小合唱和女声二重唱，也颇动听。何延昌的男声独唱表现技巧不错，声音力度的控制也有修养。他唱的几支歌也是受欢迎的节目之一。
    而特别值得提一提的“舟山锣鼓”（浙东民间音乐），这个节目用十一面大小不等的锣作为一个独奏乐器，配以民间管弦乐队作伴奏，具有丰富的形象，鲜明的色彩，这是很有独创性的一个节目，也是最受欢迎的节目。如果能更好地发展一下独奏部分，提高独奏者的技巧，当会收到更动人的效果。
