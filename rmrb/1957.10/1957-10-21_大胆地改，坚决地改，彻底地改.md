    In Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "Report on the Rectification Campaign" at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party, it was pointed out: "In the central, provincial (municipal), prefectural, and county-level organs, the movement must go through four stages: the stage of extensive airing of views and contending of ideas (concurrently with rectification and improvement), the stage of counterattacking the rightists (concurrently with rectification and improvement), the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement (concurrently with continued airing of views), and the stage of everyone studying documents, criticizing and reflecting, and improving themselves. All units that have achieved a decisive victory in the struggle against the rightists should promptly move to the third stage, which focuses on rectification and improvement, and at the same time systematically criticize bourgeois ideology." These four stages are in line with the objective reality of the movement's development.
    The purpose of the rectification campaign was originally to oppose bureaucracy, oppose sectarianism, oppose subjectivism, and improve the ideological and political level of the Party and state functionaries, improve their work style, in order to adapt to the needs of socialist transformation and socialist construction. The bourgeois rightists once used the opportunity of the extensive airing of views and contending of ideas in the first stage to launch a frenzied attack on our Party and people. Their aim was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and subvert our socialist system. Thus, the rectification campaign could not but shift to the second stage, with the main task of counterattacking the rightists. Now, the struggle against the rightists has achieved a decisive victory in many regions and many units. All such regions and units should, at the appropriate time, move to the third stage of the movement, that is, the stage of focusing on rectifying work style and improving work. Now, approximately 60% of the departments and bureaus of the central state organs have entered the rectification and improvement stage on the basis of a thorough victory in the struggle against the rightists. Some units of the Second Ministry of Machine Building and five other ministries have begun to mobilize the masses,展开 discussing major issues that must be improved, and have begun to launch a second high tide of extensive airing of views and contending of ideas through big-character posters, seminars, and other means. Of course, the transition of the movement to the rectification and improvement stage does not mean that the struggle against the rightists should be stopped uniformly in all units. Units where the struggle against the rightists is not deep or thorough enough must continue to work hard and continue the struggle against the rightists, and should never withdraw their troops hastily. However, all units where the struggle has achieved a decisive victory, that is, the rightists have been dug out and have been overthrown politically and ideologically, they have been completely isolated; the masses have gone through great debates, distinguished right from wrong on major issues, and raised their socialist consciousness; and the work of rectifying and improving while doing it has also achieved considerable results. Such units should, after a certain amount of ideological and organizational preparation, move to the stage focusing on rectification and improvement at an appropriate time.
    The entire process of the rectification campaign has two key points: one is airing, and the other is reforming. In the first stage of extensively airing views and contending of ideas, the Party called on us to boldly air views, resolutely air views, and thoroughly air views! Now, as we enter the third stage, which focuses on rectification and improvement, our slogan for the masses should still be to boldly air views, resolutely air views, and thoroughly air views; and our slogan for the leading personnel should be to boldly reform, resolutely reform, and thoroughly reform! These two slogans are interrelated.
    If we do not mobilize the broad masses to continue to extensively air views and contend of ideas, and form a second high tide of airing views, then we will not be able to thoroughly rectify our work style and improve our work. Because many of the mistakes and shortcomings in our work can only be revealed in large quantities if we fully mobilize the masses; and after various shortcomings and mistakes in our work are revealed, we must mobilize the masses to study ways to improve our work.
    Some people are worried that after the struggle against the rightists, the masses will not dare to boldly air views. This estimate is incorrect. Facts have proved that after the struggle against the rightists, the masses' socialist consciousness has been greatly improved, the original activists have become more active, and the masses who were originally in an intermediate state have gradually become active as well. Therefore, after the start of the third stage, many units quickly formed a second high tide of extensive airing of views and great debate. For example, Fudan University in Shanghai has recently posted nearly 10,000 big-character posters and held more than 1,000 seminars,展開 conducting heated debates on major issues in all aspects. Although a few people have concerns, these concerns will soon be eliminated as long as we do a good job of ideological mobilization. When carrying out ideological mobilization, the leading personnel must clearly express their attitude, express their determination to rectify and improve, and explain to the masses that the third stage and the second stage of the movement are different in nature and content. The second stage focuses on counterattacking the rightists, and its purpose is to resolve the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves; the third stage focuses on rectifying work style and improving work, and its purpose is to resolve the contradictions among the people, and resolving the contradictions among the people is precisely the theme of this rectification campaign. We must firmly believe in the majority of the masses and rely on the majority of the masses to carry out rectification and improvement. Facts have proved that as long as the mobilization work is carried out in depth, the masses will actively participate in the movement.
    To implement the policy of relying on the masses to improve work, the key lies in the fact that the leading personnel must be determined. Now, the leading personnel in various regions and units, many are determined, but there are still some people who have not made up their minds or are not very determined. Why is this?
    Some leading personnel are afraid of "getting burned" and dare not boldly and actively lead the movement. This is very wrong. One of the characteristics of the third stage is precisely that the leading personnel "get burned." If this fire can burn away the problems of the leading personnel, burn away the errors and shortcomings in the work, it can both improve the work and educate the cadres, which is a good thing that kills two birds with one stone. Is this not something we should welcome? What is there to be afraid of?
    We have seen that many units' big-character posters, once posted, cover a large area and are very powerful, making some problematic leading personnel startled. However, this is precisely a good way to use the power of the masses to promote our improvement of work. This is one of the best forms of socialist democracy. There are many things that cannot be revealed thoroughly without big-character posters, or that are not easy to solve even if they are revealed. However, once the big-character posters come out, the firepower is concentrated, the exposure is thorough, and the problem is quickly solved. All leading personnel should attach importance to big-character posters, and should not only sincerely welcome correct and basically correct criticisms, regardless of whether there are shortcomings in the way the opinions are expressed; but also welcome incorrect opinions as long as they are well-intentioned. Because even incorrect opinions are enlightening to the leading personnel, and the masses are able to distinguish whether opinions are correct or not. The workers of only forty factories and mines in Beijing put forward hundreds of thousands of opinions. More than 90% of these opinions are well-intentioned and correct. The masses have raised many very complex problems, and many have also put forward solutions. These would not be possible to solve quickly and satisfactorily if relying solely on the wisdom and ability of the leading personnel.
    Some leading personnel are seriously divorced from the masses, and they have not yet realized how serious and dangerous the phenomenon of being divorced from the masses is, so they have not yet made up their minds to put down their airs and go deep among the masses. Some of them do not go to their subordinate units all year round, and some do not do their own inspections, but only let their secretaries go to the grassroots to ask what problems there are. Should such bureaucratic phenomena be revealed, or should they be concealed? Wouldn't it be corrected faster if the masses revealed it and were supervised by the masses?
    There are also some leading personnel who are afraid that some very unreasonable things in their units, if exposed, will cause widespread dissatisfaction among the masses, and may even cause trouble. This fear is also unnecessary. We should believe that the majority of the masses are correct, and we should also believe that we can correctly handle various problems. If we mobilize the masses, thoroughly expose, boldly criticize, and earnestly debate, right and wrong can be made very clear, and problems can be properly resolved according to the formula of "unity – criticism – unity"; since the problem has been resolved, what trouble will there be? On the contrary, if we do not allow the masses to extensively air views and contend of ideas, the masses' opinions have nowhere to be expressed, and the problems are not resolved, then there will really be trouble. However, this kind of trouble is the result of the leading personnel not allowing the masses to speak, not the result of their mobilizing the masses to extensively air views and contend of ideas.
    There may also be some leading personnel who have some problems in observing the lifestyle system, and are afraid that after being exposed by the masses, on the one hand, life will not be so convenient, and on the other hand, it will not look good. However, this kind of problem must be corrected, because it undermines the lifestyle system of the organs, it undermines the relationship between the leading personnel and the masses, and it is also harmful to the cadres themselves. It is a great good thing to correct this kind of problem through criticism, and there is nothing to be afraid of. If you are afraid of this too, then what kind of revolutionary cadre are you?
    In the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement, in another high tide of extensive airing of views and contending of ideas by the masses, all leading personnel must dare to accept criticism from the masses, and promptly correct errors and shortcomings in their work. All problems that should be solved and can be solved should be solved in a timely manner. When solving these problems, we should not only fully implement the mass line, but also prevent the tendency of irresponsibility and rashly changing things. For certain excessive demands of the masses, we must insist on persuasion and education, and do not yield to them. In order to solve the problem perfectly and thoroughly, we should also organize forces to conduct a review after the problem is solved.
    For all well-intentioned criticisms from the masses during the extensive airing of views and contending of ideas, if some leading personnel not only do not accept them, but instead retaliate, or cover up their own mistakes and evade rectification and improvement, it is absolutely not allowed. Party committees at all levels should supervise and inspect the rectification and improvement work at any time, and no one is allowed to muddle through. For the sake of our great socialist cause, all comrades of the Party and the people of the whole country must carry out the rectification campaign to the end, and never withdraw their troops without a complete victory.

### 大胆地改，坚决地改，彻底地改

    大胆地改，坚决地改，彻底地改
    在我们党的八届三中全会上，邓小平同志所作“关于整风运动的报告”中指出：“在中央、省（市）、地、县四级机关，运动都必须经过四个阶段，即大鸣大放阶段（同时进行整改），反击右派阶段（同时进行整改），着重整改阶段（同时继续鸣放），每人研究文件、批评反省、提高自己阶段。凡是在反右派斗争已经取得决定性胜利的单位，应该及时转入以整改为主的第三阶段，同时对资产阶级思想进行有系统的批判。”这四个阶段是符合于运动发展的客观实际的。
    整风运动的目的本来是在于反对官僚主义、反对宗派主义、反对主观主义，提高党和国家工作人员的思想政治水平，改进作风，以适应社会主义改造和社会主义建设的需要。资产阶级右派分子曾经利用第一阶段的大鸣大放的时机，向我们的党和人民发动了猖狂的进攻。他们的目的是推翻共产党的领导，颠覆我们的社会主义制度。这样，整风运动就不能不转入以反击右派为主要任务的第二阶段。现在反击右派的斗争，已经在许多地区许多单位取得了决定性的胜利，凡是这样的地区和单位，就应当适时地转入运动的第三阶段，即着重整顿作风、改进工作的阶段。现在中央国家机关已经大约有60％的司、局单位，在反右派斗争彻底胜利的基础上，转入整改阶段了。第二机械工业部等六个部的若干单位，群众已经开始发动起来，就一些必须改进的重大问题展开讨论，并且通过大字报、座谈会等方式开始掀起第二次大鸣大放的高潮。当然，运动转入整改阶段，并不是在所有单位一律停止反右派斗争，凡是对右派的斗争还不深不透的单位，就必须再接再厉，继续进行反右派斗争，决不应该草率收兵。但是，凡是斗争已经取得决定性胜利的单位，就是说，右派分子已经挖掘出来，并且已经从政治上和思想上被斗倒，他们已经完全陷于孤立；群众经过大辩论，分清了大是大非，提高了社会主义觉悟；边整边改的工作也取得了相当的成绩，这样的单位，就应当经过一定的思想准备和组织准备，适时地转入以整改为主的阶段。
    整风运动的全部过程有两个关口：一是放，二是改。在大鸣大放的第一阶段，党号召我们大胆地放，坚决地放，彻底地放！现在，在进入以整改为主的第三阶段的时候，我们对于群众的口号仍然应该是大胆地放，坚决地放，彻底地放；而对于领导人员的口号就应该是大胆地改，坚决地改，彻底地改！这两个口号是互相关联的。
    如果不发动广大群众，继续大鸣大放，形成第二次鸣放的高潮，那末，我们就不可能彻底整顿作风、改进工作。因为我们工作中的许多错误和缺点只有充分发动群众才能大量地揭发出来；而当工作中的各种缺点和错误揭露出来以后，又必须发动群众研究改进工作的办法。
    有人耽心，在反右派斗争以后，群众不敢大胆鸣放。这种估计是不正确的。事实证明，经过反右派斗争，群众的社会主义觉悟大大地提高了，原来的积极分子更加积极，原来处于中间状态的群众，也逐渐地转为积极了。因而在第三阶段开始以后，许多单位很快就形成了第二次大鸣大放大辩论的高潮。例如上海复旦大学最近已经贴出了将近一万张大字报，举行了一千多次座谈会，对各方面的重大问题都展开了热烈的争论。虽然有少数群众存在着顾虑，但是只要作好思想动员工作，这些顾虑很快就会消除的。在进行思想动员工作的时候，领导人员要明确地表示态度，表示整改的决心，并且向群众说明，运动的第三阶段和第二阶段在性质和内容上都是不相同的，第二阶段以反击右派为主，目的是解决敌我矛盾；第三阶段是以整顿作风、改进工作为主，目的是解决人民内部矛盾，而解决人民内部矛盾正是这次整风运动的主题。我们要坚定地相信群众的多数，依靠群众的多数来进行整改。事实证明，只要动员工作作得深入，群众就会积极地投入运动。
    要贯彻执行依靠群众改进工作的方针，关键在于领导人员必须有决心。现在各地区各单位的领导人员，许多是有决心的，但是还有一部分人没有下决心或者是决心不大。这是为什么呢？
    有的领导人员害怕“引火烧身”，就不敢大胆地积极地领导运动。这是非常错误的。第三阶段的特点之一，恰恰是领导人员“引火烧身”，如果这个火能够烧掉领导人员身上的毛病，烧掉工作中的错误和缺点，既可以改进工作，又可以教育干部，一举两得，是很好的事情。这难道不是我们应该欢迎的吗？这有什么可怕呢？
    我们看到许多单位的大字报，一贴一大片，声势浩大，使一些有毛病的领导人员触目惊心。然而这正是运用群众力量，推动我们改进工作的好办法。这是社会主义民主的最好的形式之一。有很多事情不经过大字报就不可能揭露彻底，或者揭露了也不容易解决。可是大字报一出来，火力集中，揭露彻底，问题也就很快解决了。一切领导人员都应当重视大字报，不仅对正确的和基本上正确的批评应该真诚的欢迎，而不计较提意见的方式有没有缺点；就是对那些不正确的意见，只要是善意的，也应当欢迎。因为即使是不正确的意见，对领导人员也是有启发作用的，而且群众对于意见的是否正确，是能够辨别清楚的。北京市仅仅四十个厂矿企业单位的职工提出的意见就有几十万条。其中有90％以上的意见都是善意的和正确的。群众提出了许多十分复杂的问题，并且有许多提出了解决的办法。这些如果单靠领导人员的智慧和才能，是不可能迅速地完满地得到解决的。
    有些领导人员严重地脱离群众，而他们自己还没有认识到脱离群众的现象有多么严重，多么危险，因此还没有决心放下架子，深入群众。他们中间有的终年不到所属的各单位去，有的检查工作也不自己动手，只让秘书到基层问问有什么问题。诸如此类的官僚主义现象，究竟揭露出来好，还是掩蔽起来好呢？让群众揭露出来，在群众的监督之下，不是改正得更快一些么？
    还有些领导人员害怕本单位有些很不合理的事情，如果揭露出来，会引起群众的普遍不满，甚至会出乱子。这种惧怕也是不必要的。我们应该相信群众的大多数是正确的，也应该相信自己能够正确地处理各种问题。如果发动群众，彻底揭露，大胆批评，认真辩论，是非就可以弄得非常明白，问题就可以按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式得到妥善的解决；既然问题已经得到解决，那还会出什么乱子呢？相反的，如果不让群众大鸣大放，群众的意见无处发表，问题不得解决，那才会真的出乱子。然而这种乱子是领导人员不让群众说话的结果，并不是因为他们发动群众大鸣大放的结果。
    也有一些领导人员可能在遵守生活制度方面有些毛病，怕被群众揭发以后，一则生活上就不那么方便了，二则面子上也不好看。然而这种毛病是必须纠正的，因为它破坏了机关的生活制度，它破坏了领导人员同群众的关系，它对于干部本人来说也是有害无益的。把这种毛病经过批评纠正过来，是一件极大的好事，而没有任何可怕的地方。如果这也害怕，那还算得什么革命干部呢？
    在着重整改的阶段中，在群众大鸣大放的又一高潮中，一切领导人员都必须勇于接受群众的批评，及时地改正工作中的错误和缺点。凡是应该解决而又可能解决的问题都应当及时解决。当解决这些问题的时候，不仅应该充分贯彻群众路线，而且应该防止不负责任、轻易乱改的偏向。对于某些群众的过高要求，要坚持说服教育，而不要迁就。为了使问题解决得完满、彻底，在解决了问题以后还应该组织力量，进行复查。
    对于群众在大鸣大放中的一切善意的批评，如果有的领导人员不但不接受，反而加以打击报复，或者掩盖自己的错误，逃避整改，都是绝对不能容许的。各地党委应该随时督促和检查整改工作，不许有人蒙混过关。为了我们伟大的社会主义事业，全党同志和全国人民一定要把整风运动进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
