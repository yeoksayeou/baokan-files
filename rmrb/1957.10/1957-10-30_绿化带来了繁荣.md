Greening Brings Prosperity
Léi Dàifū, First Secretary of the CPC Zhaowuda League Committee, Inner Mongolia

Before liberation, Dangpudi Village in Chifeng County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was a village with barren sand, sparse trees, and extremely poor people. Wind, sand, water, and drought were the biggest threats to the village's agricultural production. The Yinhe River brought floods and yellow sand every year. Every year during the spring and summer, winds blew continuously for three or four months, burying roads, ridges, and seeds. In good harvest years, the yield per unit was only eighty catties, and the highest per capita grain possession was only two hundred catties per year. More than 80% of the households in the village lived in semi-starvation. The masses described their lives at the time as: "Unable to get cotton in winter, unable to get single layers in summer, unable to eat enough for three months a year." At that time, almost twenty households fled to other places every year due to famine.

After liberation, the Party and the People's Government seized on measures such as planting trees, developing small-scale water conservancy, and increasing fertilizer application to develop agricultural production. In 1955, advanced agricultural cooperatives were established, promoting the development of afforestation and water conservancy projects. By 1956, the barren sand dunes were greened. The afforestation area (including field protection forests, bank protection forests, channel forests, roadside and house-side forests, orchards, etc.) increased from sporadic trees to more than 3,000 mu. The irrigated area expanded from 800 mu to 7,200 mu, accounting for 88% of the total cultivated land. The use of flood silt to improve the soil reached 6,000 mu in 1956, accounting for 70% of the total cultivated land. Due to these conditions, the cooperative eliminated water and drought disasters and had bumper harvests for eight consecutive years since liberation. The grain yield per unit increased from eighty catties in 1952 to two hundred and seventy catties. The total grain output in 1956 increased more than four times compared to 1949, and it is possible to produce even more grain in 1957. An extremely poor village has become a prosperous village, and the production and farmers' lives in the entire cooperative have reached the level of well-to-do middle peasants. The masses said: "In the past, wind and sand covered the sky, with little to eat and wear," "Now the wind is clear, the water is beautiful, and there is no worry about food and clothing." Each of the 309 households in the entire cooperative was allocated 106 yuan last year, and 70 households have deposits in the credit cooperative, with some households having deposits of more than 300 yuan.

According to the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program, this cooperative has basically achieved all the goals except for grain yield per unit area, literacy, and eliminating the four pests, which will require several years of effort to achieve (telephone broadcasting is planned to be completed in 1958). At present, the public accumulation of this cooperative is also relatively large. There are currently 185 draft animals (compared to only 80 in the past), 31 carts, 198 new-style agricultural implements, and 50,000 catties of reserve grain. This cooperative has also undergone great changes in cultural undertakings, with three primary schools, five night schools, 150 young and middle-aged people studying, and sixteen young people studying in middle school.

Why has this village been able to achieve greening and increase production levels by nearly three times in six or seven years?

First, grasp the key link of fighting against wind and sand.

In the winter of 1955, a primary cooperative and fourteen mutual aid groups were developed into an advanced cooperative. As early as 1950, the Party branch put forward the slogan "Fight against wind and sand disasters," but at that time the masses said, "No one can do anything about such a big wind and sand," and were unwilling to plant trees. After that, although afforestation was launched every year, the results were not significant. In 1956, in the process of afforestation, the method of participating in the total distribution according to work in the same year and implementing the "four guarantees" (guarantee planting, guarantee survival, guarantee tending, and guarantee forest protection) by team was adopted, and the afforestation work was greatly improved, with a survival rate of over 90%. The afforestation area in the past two years was 2,000 mu, equivalent to the total afforestation area in the past five years.

Second, select suitable tree species based on soil and climate conditions. Many areas have the saying: "Poplar in sand, willow in soil, pine in rock." The sandy land in Chifeng County is also most suitable for planting poplar trees. Therefore, the main tree species selected for afforestation in this cooperative are poplar trees, with also a considerable number of elm and willow trees. Now the poplar trees here have grown up, and mulberry and fruit trees are being planted next. In some mobile sand dunes near Chifeng County, the sand dunes must be fixed before planting trees. Because they adopted the method of first planting shrubs such as Artemisia arenaria and Salix psammophila on the sand dunes to prevent the sand dunes from moving, and then planting trees, they overcame the difficulty that quicksand cannot be planted with trees.

Third, expand forests with forests, support forests with forests, mutually aid forests and water, and combine agriculture and forestry. There are three problems that must be solved in afforestation: land, labor, and seedlings. After cooperativization, land and labor are relatively easy to solve. A large number of tree planting requires a lot of seedlings. They have solved the difficulty of seedlings by adopting methods such as collecting seeds and cutting branches from existing forests, establishing small nurseries, and introducing some tree species (such as mulberry, apple, etc.). Tree planting here generally generates income in three years. The poplar trees in this cooperative, which are less than three years old, can produce six or seven catties of firewood each this year, worth more than a dime. The cooperative has already earned more than 10,000 yuan in forestry income. In addition to being distributed to the members, this income is also used to buy tree seeds, tree planting tools, etc. In this way, it is possible to "support forests with forests." After the forests grow up, they prevent water and drought disasters, which is conducive to building water conservancy projects, and with water conservancy, the forests can be irrigated. This is the mutual aid of forests and water. The development of forestry has created favorable conditions for agricultural production increase in this cooperative, turning dry land into paddy fields and sandy land into black soil. The yield of corn per mu in this cooperative reached 1,150 catties in 1956.

The current appearance of this cooperative is: small rivers meandering, trees shaded, and everyone well-fed and clothed.

    绿化带来了繁荣
    中共内蒙古昭乌达盟委第一书记　雷代夫
    内蒙古自治区赤峰县当铺地村解放前是一个荒沙遍野，树木稀少，人民生活极端贫穷的村庄。风沙水旱是这个村农业生产的最大威胁。银河的水每年给这个村庄带来洪水和黄沙。每年春夏之交这里要连续刮风三、四个月；风沙淹没公路，埋住田垅和种子。丰收年的单位产量仅有八十斤，每人每年粮食持有量最高才二百多斤。全村有80％以上的户过着半饥半饱的生活。群众形容当时的生活是：“冬换不上棉，夏换不上单，一年吃不上三个月的饱饭”。当时差不多每年都有二十户左右逃荒外地。
    解放后，党和人民政府抓住了植树造林，开展小型水利，增施肥料等措施，发展农业生产。1955年建立了高级农业社，促进植树造林、兴修水利等事业的发展。到1956年，荒凉的沙丘绿化了。造林面积（包括护田林、护岸林、渠道林、道旁宅旁林、果林等）由过去零星树木达到三千多亩。水浇地由过去八百亩扩大到七千二百亩，占整个耕地的88％。利用洪水淤地改良土壤，1956年达到六千亩，占整个耕地70％。由于这些条件，这个社消灭了水旱灾害，解放八年来连年丰收，1952年粮食单位产量由八十斤提高到二百七十斤。1956年粮食总产量比1949年增加了四倍多，1957年还可能增产更多的粮食。一个极端贫穷的村庄，变成了一个富裕的村庄，全社生产和农民的生活已达到了富裕中农的水平。群众说：“过去风沙遮天，少吃没穿”“现在风清水秀，吃穿不愁。”全社三百零九户每人去年分配到一百零六元，有七十户在信贷社有存款，有些户存款在三百元以上。
    据根农业发展纲要的要求，这个社除粮食单位产量、扫盲、除四害尚需几年努力才能达到外（电话广播计划在1958年完成），其它各条已基本达到。现在这个社的公共积累也较多。现有耕畜一百八十五头（过去只八十头），车三十一辆，新式农具等一百九十八台，储备粮五万斤。这个社在文化事业方面，也有很大改变，现有三处小学，五处夜校，一百五十个青壮年在学习，十六个青年在中学读书。
    这个村为什么能在六、七年时间实现了绿化并且使生产水平提高近三倍呢？
    第一、抓住向风沙斗争的环节。
    1955年冬将一个初级社和十四个互助组发展为一个高级社。早在1950年党支部就提出了“向风沙灾害进行斗争”的口号，但是当时群众说：“这样大的风沙，什么人也没有办法”，不愿植树造林。在这以后，虽然年年发动造林，但收效不大。1956年在造林当中采取当年按工参加总分配，实行以队为单位的四包（包栽、包活、包抚育、包护林）办法，造林工作有了大的改进，成活率达到90％以上。后两年造林二千亩，相当过去五年造林面积的总和。
    第二、根据土质、气候条件，选择适宜的树种。许多地区的群众都有这样的谚语：“沙杨、土柳、石头松”。赤峰县沙地也最适宜种杨树。因此这个社造林树种的选择主要是杨树，也有相当部分榆树、柳树。现在这里的杨树已经长起来，正在接着种桑树和果树。在赤峰县附近有些流动沙丘，植树以先必须先固定沙丘。由于它们采取了在沙丘上先种沙蒿、沙柳等灌木，使沙丘不流动再植乔木的办法，克服了流沙不能植树的困难。
    第三、以林扩林，以林养林，林水互助，农林结合。植树造林中有三个问题必须解决，一是土地，二是劳动力，三是苗木。合作化后土地与劳动力是比较容易解决的。大量植树，苗木的需要是很多的。他们采取以现有林中采籽打枝、建立小型苗圃、引进部分树种（如桑、苹果等）等办法解决了苗木的困难。这里植树，一般三年即有收入。这个社不到三年的杨树，今年每棵能产六、七斤烧柴，价值一角多。全社林业收入已得一万余元，这些收入除分配给社员以外，还用来买树种、植树工具等。这样，就可以“以林养林”。林木起来后防治了水旱灾，有利于兴修水利，有了水利林木又可以得到灌溉。这就是林水互助。林业发展以后给这个社农业增产创造了有利条件，把旱地变成了水田，把沙地变成黑土地。这个社的玉米在1956年每亩产量达到一千一百五十斤。
    这个社现在的面貌是：小河缭绕、树木成荫，人人丰衣足食。
