Currently, there are approximately 300,000 beehives raised using Langstroth hives in our country, and over one million swarms raised using traditional methods.

The current annual national honey production is over 10,000 tons, and beeswax production is about 1 million jin. The honey produced is mainly supplied to the domestic people, with a portion provided for export. The quality of exported honey has reached international standards and is welcomed in the Western European market.

Beekeeping requires little investment but yields great returns, and it can promote increased crop production, making it a very good sideline for rural areas. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    全国养了多少蜂
    我国目前用活框箱式饲养的蜜蜂约有三十万箱，用土法饲养的蜜蜂在一百万群以上。
    现在全国年产蜂蜜一万多吨、蜂蜡约一百多万斤。所产蜂蜜主要供应国内人民，一部分提供出口。出口蜂蜜的质量达到了国际标准，并在西欧市场上受到欢迎。
    饲养蜜蜂投资少，收益大，且能促进农作物增产，是农村一项很好的副业。　（据新华社讯）
