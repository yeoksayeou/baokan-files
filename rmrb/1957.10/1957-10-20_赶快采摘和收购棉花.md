　　Hasten the Picking and Purchasing of Cotton

　　Currently, the vast majority of cotton-producing areas across the country have entered the peak season for picking and purchasing cotton. This is an opportunity that cannot be missed. Let us act quickly and fully grasp the picking, drying, and purchasing of cotton. This is the primary task of Party organizations, relevant state organs, and the broad masses of cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas.

　　This year's cotton harvest is good, estimated to be two to three million dan more than last year. The quality of cotton is also relatively good: the grade is generally one level higher than last year, the fiber length is generally one-sixteenth to two-sixteenths of an inch longer than last year, and the moisture content is generally about 3% lower than last year. It is estimated that the income of cotton farmers across the country will increase by about 150 million yuan due to the improved cotton quality. Currently, a socialist debate is underway in rural areas across the country, and the socialist consciousness of rural cadres and the broad masses of farmers has been further enhanced. As long as we fully utilize these favorable conditions and combine the cotton unified purchase work with the socialist debate, this year's cotton unified purchase task will not be difficult to complete.

　　This year's cotton production is a foregone conclusion, but if we mobilize cotton farmers to pick all the cotton fields clean and strive to bring all the good and bad cotton home, we can greatly increase the actual harvest. According to surveys in major cotton-producing provinces and regions, the "eyelashes," fallen blossoms, and dead buds of cotton that are not picked cleanly in each mu of cotton field generally amount to about two to three jin of seed cotton. If all this cotton is picked clean, an average of more than two jin of seed cotton can be picked per mu, and more than 1.7 million dan of seed cotton can be added to the 80 to 90 million mu of cotton fields across the country. This is a large number! Agricultural cooperatives and all cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas should understand: picking all the cotton clean, in addition to spending some effort, does not cost anything else, but can increase a lot of income. This is beneficial to the country and to oneself, so why not do it? In the process of picking cotton, we should also establish a responsibility system and an inspection system for contracted areas, as well as a system of mutual supervision and mutual evaluation between production teams (groups). In the final stage of cotton picking, a mass review of cotton fields and cotton stalks should be carried out, and production should be evaluated and summarized on this basis. In a word, we must take all measures to strive for cotton "every drop returned home," "every fluff returned home." In order to improve the quality of cotton, we should also advocate the method of separate picking, separate drying, separate ginning, separate storage, and separate sales, and do not mix good and bad cotton together.

　　Reasonably compressing the amount of cotton retained by cotton-producing areas is of great importance to completing the cotton unified purchase task. At present, some cotton farmers do not lack cotton, some cotton farmers still have old cotton in stock, some cotton farmers lack a small amount of cotton, and only a few cotton farmers feel that the amount of cotton retained is insufficient due to legitimate needs. This shows that it is not only necessary but also possible to appropriately compress the amount of cotton retained by cotton farmers; as long as the agricultural cooperatives make appropriate adjustments to the different needs of the members when distributing retained cotton, the national standards for retained cotton this year can fully guarantee the needs of cotton farmers.

　　According to the experience of Hebei, Shandong and other places, agricultural cooperatives can adopt two methods for the distribution of retained cotton. One method is to allocate cotton evenly according to the standard for retained cotton, regardless of whether it is needed or not, or how much is needed. This method has two disadvantages. One disadvantage is that many cotton farmers do not need cotton but need cash. The agricultural cooperative should have sold the cotton that the cotton farmers do not need to the state and distributed the proceeds from the sale of cotton to them; however, the result of the average distribution of retained cotton not only reduces the amount of cotton purchased by the state but also causes some inconvenience to the cotton farmers. Another disadvantage is that a small number of farmers who actually need more than the standard for retained cotton cannot get reasonable adjustments. This method is only harmful and not beneficial to the country and the cotton farmers. Another method of allocating retained cotton is to distribute cotton to members who need cotton and cash to members who need cash, after persuasion and education, without exceeding the standard for retained cotton stipulated by the state. Some places also stipulate that if members are willing to allocate lower quality cotton, they can be compensated with cash according to a certain quality price difference. For individual cotton farmers with special needs, appropriate adjustments can be made within the cooperative. The advantage of this method is that it can not only appropriately take care of the actual needs of the members but also does not break through the standard for retained cotton stipulated by the state; it can not only facilitate the use of funds for some members but also appropriately increase the amount of cotton purchased by the state. The Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative in Guan County, Shandong Province, adopted this method. The members reported that the amount of cotton needed was 2,063 jin, an average of 0.7 jin per person, which is 65% lower than the national standard of 2 jin of cotton retained per person this year, and 76.7% lower than the standard of 3 jin of cotton retained per person last year. If this method is widely promoted throughout the country, it can at least guarantee that this year's standard for retained cotton will not be broken, so the country will reasonably compress the amount of cotton retained by one to two million dan on the basis of last year. This is also a large number.

　　Reasonably compressing the amount of cotton retained in cotton-producing areas is contradictory to some cotton farmers, especially the wealthy farmers. These farmers hope to retain more cotton to seek high profits and engage in commercial speculation. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct appropriate criticism and education on them, and strictly manage the market to prohibit cotton and native cloth from entering the free market.

　　As long as the above-mentioned work is done well, the country's cotton unified purchase task this year is entirely possible to overfulfill; the country's cotton inventory can be appropriately increased, so as to balance the needs of industry and the market in years of poor harvests, and implement the principle of supplementing deficiencies with surpluses. The Party and government leading organs in various cotton-producing areas should immediately make careful arrangements, act quickly, prevent blind optimism, and ensure the overfulfillment of this year's cotton purchase task.

### 赶快采摘和收购棉花

　　赶快采摘和收购棉花
    目前全国绝大部分棉产区，已经进入采摘棉花和收购棉花的旺季。这个时机是不可错过的。赶快行动起来，全力抓紧棉花的采摘、整晒和收购工作。这是当前棉产区党组织、有关的国家机关和广大棉农的首要任务。
    今年棉花收成不错，估计可比去年增产二、三百万担。棉花的质量也比较好：品级一般比去年提高一个等级，纤维长度一般比去年长十六分之一到十六分之二英寸，含水量一般比去年少3％左右。估计全国棉农因为棉花质量提高而增加的收入约在一亿五千万元左右。目前全国农村正在进行社会主义大辩论，农村干部和广大农民的社会主义觉悟进一步提高了。我们只要充分运用这些有利条件，把棉花统购工作同社会主义大辩论结合进行，今年的棉花统购任务是不难完成的。
    今年的棉花生产已成定局，可是如果发动棉农把全部棉田采摘干净，争取好坏棉花全部还家，还能够大大增加实际收获量。根据各主要产棉省区的调查，每亩棉田没有摘干拣净的“眼睫毛”、落地花和僵瓣棉，一般约有二斤到三斤皮棉。如果把这些棉花全部拣净，每亩平均能够多采摘二斤多皮棉，全国八、九千万亩棉田，可以增加一百七十万担以上的皮棉。这是一个很大的数字！产棉区的农业合作社和全体棉农们应该了解：把全部棉花摘干拣净，除了多用一些工夫以外，再不要花费什么，却能增加许多收入。这对国家、对自己都有好处，何乐而不为呢？在采摘棉花的过程中，还应该建立划片包干的责任制度和检查制度，建立生产队（组）之间的互相监督和互相评比的制度。在采摘棉花的尾期，应该对棉田和棉秸进行一次群众性的复查，在这个基础上评比和总结生产。一句话，要采取一切办法，争取棉花“点滴还家”、“朵絮还家”。为了提高棉花的质量，还应该提倡分摘、分晒、分轧、分存、分售的办法，不要把好坏棉花混杂在一起。
    合理压缩棉产区留用棉花的数量，对于完成棉花统购任务有极大的关系。现在有些棉农并不缺少棉花，有些棉农还存有陈棉，有些棉农缺少少量棉花，只有个别棉农确实因为有正当需要而感到留棉数量不足。这就说明，适当地压缩棉农的留棉数量，不但是必要的，而且是可能的；只要农业社在分配留用棉的时候，对于社员的不同需要进行适当的调剂，国家今年规定的留棉标准，完全可以保证棉农的需要。
    根据河北、山东等地的经验，农业社对于留用棉花的分配，可以采取两种作法。一种作法是不管需要不需要，不管需要多或需要少，一律按照留棉标准平均分配。这种作法有两个缺点。一个缺点是，不少棉农不需要棉花，而需要现款，农业社本来应该把棉农不需要的棉花卖给国家，而把卖棉款分给他们；可是平均分配留棉的结果，既使国家减少了购棉数量，又给棉农造成某种不方便。另一个缺点是，少数实际需要超过留棉标准的农民，不能得到合理的调剂。这种办法对国家、对棉农都只有坏处没有好处。分配留用棉的另一种作法是，经过说服教育，在不超过国家规定的留棉标准的条件下，给需要棉花的社员分棉花，给需要现款的社员分现款。有些地方还规定如果社员愿意分配质量较次的棉花，可以按照一定的质量差价补给现款。对于个别有特殊需要的棉农，可以在社内给予适当的调剂。这种作法的好处是：既能适当照顾社员的实际需要，又不会突破国家规定的留棉标准；既使某些社员得到用款的便利，又能适当增加国家的棉花收购数量。山东冠县五一农业社采用这种作法，社员自报棉花需要量为二千零六十三斤，每人平均零点七斤，比国家规定今年每人平均留棉二斤的标准还低65％，比去年每人平均留棉三斤的标准降低76.7％。如果在全国普遍推行这种作法，最少能够保证今年的留棉标准不被突破，这样，全国就会在去年的基础上合理压缩一百几十万担棉花留用量。这也是一个很大的数字。
    合理压缩棉产区的留棉数量，同一部分棉农、主要是富裕农民是有矛盾的。这部分农民希望多留棉花谋取高利，进行商业投机。因此，必须对他们进行适当的批判和教育，并且把市场严格管理起来，禁止棉花、土布进入自由市场。
    只要作好了上面说的这些工作，今年国家的棉花统购任务就完全有可能超额完成；国家的棉花库存就能够适当地增加，以便在歉收年景平衡工业和市场的需要，实行以丰补歉。各产棉地区的党政领导机关应该立即进行周密的安排，迅速行动起来，防止盲目乐观情绪，保证超额完成今年的棉花收购任务。
