Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 9th October. A person in charge of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Statistics Bureau told Xinhua reporters today that Xinjiang has newly built 359 large and small factories and mines in the eight years since liberation. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the total industrial output value will increase by 61.65 times compared to 1949.

Before liberation, Xinjiang's industry was very backward. When it was liberated in 1949, there were only a few small printing factories, soap factories, coal mines, and power plants with outdated equipment.

Since 1950, the Party and the People's Government have actively developed Xinjiang's industry despite the heavy difficulties of inconvenient transportation and lack of equipment. At present, Xinjiang already has petroleum joint enterprises, iron and steel enterprises, textile printing and dyeing joint enterprises, automobile and tractor repair and assembly plants, agricultural tool manufacturing plants, and large-scale factories producing electricity, cement, sulfuric acid, flour, raw silk, etc. The construction of these modern enterprises has forever ended the history of industrial backwardness in this remote ethnic minority area.

Before liberation, the production and living materials needed by people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang mostly relied on supply from other places. Now, Xinjiang produces nearly a hundred kinds of major industrial products. These products have played a great role in developing Xinjiang's construction undertakings and meeting the living needs of people of all ethnic groups in the past few years. During the Kuomintang rule, Xinjiang lacked pig iron, and the countryside severely lacked iron farm tools. Farmers had to pay a stone of wheat to buy a "kantuman" (similar to a mattock). Since the establishment of an iron and steel plant in Xinjiang, it has not only produced a considerable amount of various steel products to supply basic construction every year, but also enabled Xinjiang to establish an agricultural tool manufacturing industry. In the past few years, Xinjiang Agricultural Machinery Factory has used raw materials supplied by local iron and steel plants to manufacture 115,000 new-style agricultural tools (pieces) for farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups, changing Xinjiang's backward farming techniques. The construction of Xinjiang's July 1st Cotton Textile Factory has enabled people of all ethnic groups to have their own textile industry for the first time, and to wear calico printed and dyed by local printing and dyeing factories according to the preferences of people of all ethnic groups.

The production volume of various industrial products is increasing rapidly every year. For example, electricity production has increased by more than 71 times in eight years, flour has increased by 17 times, and products such as pig iron and steel have increased by about 20 times during the First Five-Year Plan period. Now, all types of industries have completed the output value plan stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan half a year or a year ahead of schedule. By the end of this year, it is estimated that the proportion of industrial output value in Xinjiang's national economy will increase from 0.53% in 1949 to more than 28%.

    八年建设三百五十九个厂矿
    新疆工业产值增长六十一倍
    各族人民需要的许多生产资料和生活资料已经能够就地制造
    新华社乌鲁木齐9日电　新疆维吾尔自治区统计局负责人今天对新华社记者说：新疆解放八年来已新建大小厂矿三百五十九个；到今年底预计，工业总产值将比1949年增加六十一点六五倍。
    新疆在解放前工业非常落后，1949年解放的时候，只有几个设备陈旧的小型印刷厂、肥皂厂、煤矿和电厂。
    从1950年起，党和人民政府在交通不便、器材缺乏等重重困难的条件下，积极发展了新疆工业。目前，新疆已经有了石油联合企业，钢铁企业，纺织印染联合企业，有了汽车和拖拉机修配厂、农具制造厂，以及生产电、水泥、硫酸、面粉、生丝等的大型工厂。这些现代化企业的兴建，永远结束了这个边远民族地区工业落后的历史。
    解放前新疆各族人民所需生产资料和生活资料大都依靠外地供应。现在新疆所生产的主要工业产品有近百种。这些产品在过去几年来对发展新疆各项建设事业和满足各族人民生活需要起了很大作用。在国民党统治时代由于新疆缺乏生铁，农村十分缺乏铁制农具，农民购买一把坎土镘（类似镢头）要付出成石小麦。新疆建立钢铁厂以后，每年不仅生产出相当数量的各种钢材供应基本建设，而且使新疆有条件建立了农具制造工业。几年来新疆农具机械厂用本地钢铁厂供应的原材料为各族农牧民制造了十一万五千部（件）新式农具，改变了新疆落后的耕作技术。新疆七一棉纺厂的兴建，使各族人民第一次有了自己的纺织工业，穿上了本地区印染厂根据各族人民的爱好印染的花布。
    各类工业品的生产量每年都在激增。如电力生产在八年内增长七十一倍多，面粉增长十七倍，生铁、钢材等产品在第一个五年计划期间都增长了二十倍左右。现在各类工业都提前半年或一年完成了第一个五年计划规定的产值计划。到今年底，预计工业产值在新疆国民经济中所占的比重，将从1949年的0.53％增长到28％以上。
