Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 10th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the most important issue of this session on October 10th: the issue of disarmament. The United States representative, Lodge, was the first to speak at the Political Committee's morning session. His speech demonstrated that there were no factors in the position adopted by Western countries that could facilitate an agreement on the issue of disarmament. Lodge attempted to absolve Western countries of the responsibility for bringing disarmament negotiations to a standstill.

The Political Committee's afternoon session continued the discussion on disarmament.

The head of the Soviet delegation to the current United Nations General Assembly and the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gromyko, put forward proposals for preliminary disarmament measures that should be implemented as soon as possible.

Gromyko said: So far, no agreement has been reached on any issue in the field of disarmament. This is mainly the responsibility of Western countries, because they have based their foreign policy on the arms race, the formation of aggressive military blocs, and the "Cold War." The United States government clearly has no serious intention of promoting an early agreement on the issue of disarmament. It seems that the United States government does not want to reach such an agreement in the future either.

Gromyko demanded that preliminary measures for disarmament be taken immediately, striving to reach specific agreements on certain individual issues of disarmament. He said that the Soviet government, in the spirit of promoting the cessation of the arms race, has put forward its own proposals on these partial measures. The preliminary disarmament measures proposed by the Soviet Union are:

One, immediately cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, even if it is for a period of two or three years; resolve this issue separately from other issues of disarmament.

Two, countries should mutually undertake the obligation not to use atomic and hydrogen weapons. To achieve this goal, a temporary agreement, even if it is for a period of five years, should be concluded, so that this issue can be discussed again after five years.

Three, reduce the armed forces of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France stationed on German territory by one-third or other negotiated figures. At the same time, the four major powers should separately reduce their armed forces stationed on the territory of member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.

Four, study the issue of abolishing foreign military bases on the territory of other countries, and first agree on which military bases can be abolished during the first phase of implementing disarmament measures.

Five, countries possessing nuclear weapons should mutually agree not to station atomic forces or store atomic and hydrogen weapons outside their own territory. In this regard, the significant positive significance of the recent proposals put forward by the governments of the People's Republic of Poland and the Czechoslovak Republic at this session of the General Assembly cannot be ignored.

Six, in order to prevent one country from suddenly attacking another country, mutually agree to establish monitoring posts on an equal basis at the same time as an agreement is reached on preliminary measures in the field of disarmament.

Finally, Gromyko expressed the hope that the General Assembly's discussion of the issue of disarmament would help reach concrete resolutions, which would, to some extent, satisfy the hopes of hundreds of millions of people.

　　联大政委会开始讨论裁军问题
    苏联提出裁军初步措施
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社纽约10日讯：联合国大会政治委员会10月10日开始讨论本届会议的最重要问题——裁军问题。美国代表洛奇在政治委员会的上午会议上头一个发言。他的发言说明了，在西方国家所采取的立场中，并没有出现能够促使裁军问题达成协议的任何因素。洛奇企图为西方国家洗刷它们使裁军谈判陷入困境的责任。
    政治委员会下午会议继续讨论了裁军问题。
    出席本届联合国大会的苏联代表团团长、苏联外交部长葛罗米柯提出了应当尽速实行的初步裁军措施的建议。
    葛罗米柯说：到目前为止，在裁军方面还没有能够就任何一个问题达成协议，这主要应该由西方国家负责，因为它们把军备竞赛、成立侵略性的军事集团和“冷战”作为外交政策的基础。美国政府显然没有认真打算促使裁军问题早日取得协议。看来美国政府今后也不想达成这样的协定。
    葛罗米柯要求现在就着手实行裁军的初步措施，争取就裁军的某些个别问题达成具体协议。他说，苏联政府本着促成停止军备竞赛的愿望，就这些局部措施提出了自己的建议。苏联所提出的初步裁军措施是：
    一、立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器，即使是以两三年为期；把这个问题同裁军的其他问题分开来单独解决。
    二、各国相约承担不使用原子武器和氢武器的义务，为达到这一目的，应该缔结一项即使是为期五年的临时协定，以便在五年之后再来讨论这个问题。
    三、把美、苏、英、法四国驻在德国领土上的武装部队裁减三分之一或其他经过协商的数字，同时四大国应分别裁减它们驻在北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约成员国领土上的武装部队。
    四、研究取消在别国领土上的外国军事基地问题，并且首先商定在执行裁军措施第一阶段过程中那些军事基地可以取消。
    五、拥有核武器的国家相约不在本国领土以外的地方驻扎原子部队和贮存原子武器和氢武器。在这方面不能不指出波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府最近在本届联大所提出的建议的重大的积极意义。
    六、为了防止一个国家突然进攻另一个国家，相约在裁军方面的初步措施达成协议同时，在对等的基础上建立监督岗。
    最后，葛罗米柯表示希望大会对裁军问题的讨论将有助于达成具体决议，这样，就会在某种程度上满足亿万人民的希望。
