Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Regions Actively Purchase Wild Oilseeds

    (Our report) Currently, it is the season for wild plant oilseeds to mature and be harvested. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have, based on past exploration, trial pressing, and laboratory results, determined the varieties and prices for purchase, and are vigorously organizing the masses to collect and purchase them. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Guangdong, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, and other provinces have respectively held specialized symposiums on wild plant oilseeds, organized sample exhibitions, and experience exchange meetings on collection and processing techniques. They have also determined that purchasing wild plant oilseeds will be one of the central tasks of native product procurement in the second half of this year.

    China's wild plant oilseed resources are very abundant. According to current incomplete statistics, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have discovered many kinds of wild plant oilseeds, of which more than 150 kinds have been tested or trial pressed, with oil content ranging from 15% to 60% or more. The main ones include cocklebur seeds, glasswort seeds, Chinese toon seeds, goldthread seeds, candlenut seeds, crow-dipper seeds, tree peanuts, sal seeds, mountain pepper seeds, horse mulberry seeds, and agarwood seeds. According to preliminary investigations in some areas, the annual output of cocklebur seeds, glasswort seeds, and other eight kinds alone is about 60,000 tons. These oilseeds are not only high in yield and oil content, but also have a wide range of uses for their oils. Generally, they can be used as industrial raw materials for soap, paint, ink, etc. Glasswort seed oil, Chinese toon seed oil, and others can also be used for edible purposes.

    This year, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have generally attached importance to the purchase work. According to statistics from eighteen provinces (regions), including Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, Hubei, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Jilin, the preliminary plan is to purchase about 100,000 tons of various wild plant oilseeds, an increase of more than ten times compared to last year. If this task can be completed, it can increase the country's production of vegetable oil by more than 12,000 tons and oil cake by more than 80,000 tons. This will play a significant role in supporting industrial and agricultural production, increasing farmers' income, and alleviating the current tight supply of oils and fats.

    各地供销社积极收购野生油料
    本报讯　目前正值野生植物油料成熟和采集季节，各地供销合作社已根据过去发掘、试榨和化验的结果，确定了收购品种和价格，大力组织群众采摘和收购。广东、江西、山东、河南、四川等省的供销社分别召开了野生植物油料专业座谈会，举办了样品展览，采集和加工技术的经验交流会，并且确定将采购野生植物油料作为今年下半年土产采购工作的中心任务之一。
    我国的野生植物油料资源十分丰富。据目前不完全统计，各地供销合作社已发现许多种野生植物油料，其中已经过化验或试榨，含油量在15％到60％以上的有一百五十几种。主要的有苍耳籽、盐蒿籽、椿树籽、黄连籽、石栗籽、乌籽、树花生、沙罗籽、山苍籽、马桑籽、土沉香籽等。据部分地区的初步调查，仅苍耳籽、盐蒿籽等八种年产量即在六万吨左右。这些油料不仅产量大、含油量高，而且油脂的用途也很广，一般都可作肥皂、油漆、油墨等工业原料。盐蒿籽油、椿树籽油等还可供食用。
    今年，各地供销合作社普遍重视了收购工作。据河北、河南、山西、江苏、江西、山东、湖北、四川、广东、吉林等十八个省（区）统计，初步计划可收购各种野生植物油料十万吨左右，约比去年增加十倍以上。如能完成这一任务，即可为国家增产植物油一万二千多吨，油饼八万多吨。对支援工农业生产，增加农民收入，缓和当前油脂供应紧张情况都有很大的作用。
