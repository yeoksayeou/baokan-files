    A "Common Party Member"
    I read the following small report in a corner of the newspaper:
    “'Comrade Jiang Tianjie, I am going to the Military Commission for a meeting this afternoon and cannot attend the Party group meeting!' The voice of Commander Liu Yalou came from the microphone, and he was asking the Party group leader for leave.
    Although Comrade Liu Yalou's work is very busy, he always tries his best to attend Party branch meetings or group meetings. Although he is a member of the Central Committee..., he always appears as an ordinary Party member in front of the group leader. Once, the group leader did not notify him of the meeting time. After he found out, he took the initiative to call to inquire. In the conversation, he found that the group leader had some concerns, so he sincerely said to the group leader: 'Don't forget that I am also an ordinary Party member...'" This should be enlightening for those who consider themselves "special Party members"!

    一个“普通党员”
    我在报纸的一角，读到如下小小的报道：
    “‘蒋天杰同志，今天下午我去军委开会，不能参加党小组会啦！’话筒里传来了司令员刘亚楼同志的声音，他在向党小组长请假。
    刘亚楼同志的工作虽然十分繁忙，但党的支部大会或小组会，他总是尽量争取参加。他虽然是中央委员……，但在小组长面前，他总是以一个普通党员的身份出现。有一次，小组长没有通知他开会时间，他知道了以后，便主动打电话询问。在对话中，他发觉小组长有些顾虑，就诚恳地向小组长说：‘你别忘了我也是一个普通的党员……’”  这对以“特殊党员”自居的人该是有所启发的吧！
