    Sincere Friendship, Precious Performance
    Wu Xiaobang
    The arrival of the Cultural and Art Delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia in Beijing is a celebratory event in the Chinese art scene. Cambodian dance art is not unfamiliar in the history of Chinese dance. Records can be found in the Book of Sui, the New Book of Tang, and the Old Book of Tang. This performance adds new and precious pages to the history of cultural and artistic exchange between China and Cambodia.
    I will first talk about these three programs: "Blessing Dance," "Fairy Dance in a Garden of Blooming Flowers," and "Farewell Dance." All three dances are performed by Princess Norodom Bopha Devi. They are all beautiful and moving dances. Through the lyrics specially rehearsed by the Queen, and the performances of Princess Norodom Bopha Devi and other dancers, we clearly understood the lofty theme of "Blessing Dance": the Cambodian people send blessings to Chairman Mao and the Chinese people.
    This dance is performed with graceful and gentle movements. The dancers, in devout lyrics and beautiful music, and wearing appropriate costumes, appear before the audience with solemnity and nobility, just like Cambodian sculpture and architecture. Princess Norodom Bopha Devi's beautiful eyes and gentle hand movements, as well as the successful cooperation of other actors, deeply moved us. When the actors walked and kowtowed, our hearts were also moved by this blessing of friendship. This is a revelation of love that is as close as blood. While appreciating their successful performance, I was also thinking: this performance by Cambodian artists will leave a beautiful and solid seed in the Chinese dance art garden. I am happy that China's beautiful art garden is becoming richer.
    In the "Fairy Dance in a Garden of Blooming Flowers," Princess Norodom Bopha Devi's movements, whether soaring in the air or moving in the flowers, are performed with highly refined artistic techniques, allowing people to immediately imagine how deftly and delicately the noble Devatas move in the flowers. In the elegant and gentle dance, every still posture in motion clearly explains the development process of the dance's inner movement. From Princess Norodom Bopha Devi's gestures and eye expressions, the audience is told about the various transcendent and extraordinary emotions of the fairy.
    At the beginning, she picks flowers alone in the garden, using blooming flowers to symbolize her wishes, as if they are the flowers of her heart. Before leaving the garden, she still wants to maintain this perfect and happy wish, so she picks her favorite flower and brings it back to the palace, filling her bedroom with fragrance. Later, her maids follow and pick flowers in the same way for the fairy's happiness. This is a high-style dance, full of poetry and the happiness of life. Princess Norodom Bopha Devi performed this dance with such depth and profound meaning.
      "Farewell Dance" is a dance full of deep affection. The dancers entrust the emotion of farewell to the connection between China and Cambodia. At the end of the dance, all the actors kneel on the ground and wave the national flags of the two countries to the audience, as if saying: "Goodbye, dear China, we love you like brothers and sisters. Close friendship will always connect our two countries." This action clearly demonstrates the wishes of the people of both countries.
    Princess Norodom Bopha Devi has left us with a deep impression. She is a genius in dance art, and her beautiful performance is like a Cambodian pearl, shining with brilliance on the friendship between China and Cambodia.
    In addition, we also very much liked the Indian epic "Ramayana" dance drama "Monkey King Hanuman Tempts the Fish Queen Sovan Macha," "Dance of the Brothers Chom Pol and Chom Pa," as well as the dance dramas "The Myth of Borei Chey Chumnas" and "Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala."
    The image of the Fish Queen is very beautiful, and the costumes are also very exquisite. In terms of movements, whether it is floating or swimming around, it is not only like a fish but also a fish with a noble status. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who played the Monkey King Hanuman, performed very successfully. The young actors who played the brothers Chom Pol and Chom Pa also performed very well. The two dance dramas "The Myth of Borei Chey Chumnas" and "Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala" express the struggle between good and evil in Cambodian mythology, with good ultimately triumphing over evil. The actors who played Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala have very skilled acting skills. Although the content of the dance drama is very complex, it uses the traditional concise and symbolic techniques of classical dance, and finally accurately explains the plot.
    The singing team and band of Cambodia in this visit performance also won people's appreciation. When we heard:
    "We pray to all the gods, we
    offer you offerings."
    and:
    "Ah, my dear one, my love's
    most sublime symbol. Boldly taste the
    happiness of life!"
    Such lyrics can recall the magnificent and life-longing recitations of the ancient Chinese poet Qu Yuan to the gods, love, and nature in Nine Songs and Summoning of the Soul. Although we do not understand the Cambodian language, the beauty of the expression and the cadence of the singing brought us to the mountains and rivers, palaces, forests, and thatched cottages of Cambodia, and intoxicated us in another realm of happiness.
    Cambodia's music is also rich and colorful, it can play various tunes and convey the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and separation in people's lives. Their musicians are versatile and can find tunes to express life scenes everywhere like poets. Their improvisations, whether on the top of a mountain or in a palace, in a forest, or in a thatched cottage, will play chapters about mountains, palaces, forests, cottages, etc. Similarly, in order to express emotions, they can perform endless variations.
    Cambodia's music performance brought us unlimited joy and confidence. They have preserved and developed their own national musical instruments, and played tunes from the independent and happy Cambodian people on familiar instruments. What an admirable thing this is.
    Finally, let me bless the Cambodian pearl, and also the pearl of friendship between China and Cambodia, Princess Norodom Bopha Devi, the young Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and all the artists for the successful performance. (Attached picture)

### 真诚的友谊，珍贵的演出

    真诚的友谊，珍贵的演出
    吴晓邦
    柬埔寨王国文化艺术代表团来到北京，这是中国艺坛上一件值得庆贺的事情。柬埔寨的舞蹈艺术，在中国舞蹈史上，不是陌生的。在隋书、新唐书和旧唐书上都有记载。这一次演出在中柬文化艺术的交流史上增添了新的珍贵的篇页。
    我先谈谈这三个节目：“祝福舞”“百花盛开的花园中的仙女舞”和“告别舞”。这三个舞蹈都是由帕花·黛维公主扮演的。它们都是美丽动人的舞蹈。通过王后特意排练的歌词大意和帕花·黛维公主及其他舞蹈家们的表演，我们明确了“祝福舞”的崇高的主题：柬埔寨人民向毛主席和中国人民祝福。
    这个舞蹈是在幽雅柔和的舞姿中进行的。舞蹈者在虔诚的歌词和美妙的音乐中，穿着合适的服装，正像柬埔寨的雕刻和建筑艺术一样，既庄严而又高贵的出现在观众面前。帕花·黛维公主的美丽的眼睛和两手柔和的运动，以及其他演员们成功的配合，深深的感动了我们。当演员们行走和叩拜的时候，我们的心也都为这种祝福的友谊所激动起来了。这是一种亲如骨肉的爱的表情的透露。我一面欣赏她们成功的演出，同时我还在想：柬埔寨艺术家们这次的演出，将在中国舞蹈艺术园地中留下一个美好结实的种子，我为中国美好的艺术园地更丰富起来而高兴。
    在“百花盛开的花园中的仙女舞”内，帕花·黛维公主的动作，无论在空中回翔或在花丛中行动，都是从高度精炼的艺术手法中去表演的，使人即刻可以想像高贵的德伯河沙仙后如何灵巧和细致的在花丛中回翔。在幽雅和柔和的舞姿中，每一个运动中的静止姿态，明确的交代了舞蹈内动的发展过程。从帕花·黛维公主的手势和眼神的表演上，告诉了观众们仙后的各种超然的和不平凡的情感来。
    开始时她独自一人在花园中摘花，把朵朵盛开的鲜花来象征自己的心愿，好像是她心上的花。她要在离开花园以前，仍然保持这种美满幸福的心愿，于是她就摘下了她所最喜爱的花朵带回宫中，使她的寝宫满室芬芳。后来，她的侍女跟踪而来，也照样的为仙后的幸福愿望而摘花。这是一个格调很高的舞蹈，充满了诗和人生的幸福。帕花·黛维公主在这一个舞蹈内表演得这样深刻，意味深长。
      “告别舞”是一个情长谊深的舞蹈。舞蹈家们把告别的情感寄托在中柬两国联系在一起。舞蹈的最后，全体演员跪在地上，用两个国家的国旗向观众挥动，好像在说：“再见吧，亲爱的中国，我们像兄弟姊妹般的热爱你。亲密的友谊，永远把我们两国联系在一起”。通过这一动作，鲜明地说明两国人民的愿望。
    帕花·黛维公主给我们留下了深刻的印象。她是舞蹈艺术上的天才，她的优美的表演像一颗柬埔寨的明珠，在中柬友好上闪耀着光彩。
    另外我们很喜欢印度史诗上“拉玛雅拉”舞剧“猴王哈努曼引诱鱼后索万·木卡”，“朱墨良和朱伯良兄弟舞”，及舞剧“伯雷阿·金纳凤的神话”和“雷木·爱索与莫尼·麦卡拉舞”等。
    鱼后的形象非常美丽，服饰也很精致。在动作上，不论是沉浮或游来游去，不光是像一条鱼而且有高贵身分的鱼。扮演猴王哈努曼的夏卡朋王子，演得很成功。扮演朱墨良和朱伯良兄弟两人的少年演员也表演得很好。“伯雷阿·金纳凤的神话”及“雷木·爱索与莫尼·麦卡拉”两个舞剧是表现了柬埔寨神话中善与恶的斗争，善终于战胜了恶。扮演雷木·爱索与莫尼·麦卡拉的演员，演技非常纯熟。虽然舞剧的内容很复杂，但采用了古典舞蹈传统的简炼和象征手法，终于精确地把剧情交代清楚。
    关于柬埔寨在这次访问演出中的歌唱队和乐队，也获得了人们的赞赏。当我们听到： 
    “我们向所有的天神祈求，我
    们向你们敬献供礼。”
    和：
    “啊，我的亲爱的人，我的爱情
    的最崇高的象征。大胆的来尝尝生
    活的幸福滋味吧！”
    这样的歌词，就能回忆起我国古代大诗人屈原在九歌和招魂中向天神、爱情和大自然的一种豪迈而又渴望生活的吟诵。虽然我们不懂得柬埔寨的语言，但表情的美妙和歌声的抑扬，把我们带到了柬埔寨的山水、宫殿、森林和茅舍中去，陶醉在另一个幸福的境界里。
    柬埔寨的音乐也是丰富多采的，它能够演奏出各种曲调和传达人民生活中喜、怒、哀、乐及离别的情绪。他们的音乐家是多才多艺的，像诗人一样到处可以找出表达生活情景的曲调。他们的即兴创作，不论在山头上或者在宫殿里，在森林，在茅舍中，都会演奏出关于山、宫殿、森林、茅舍等的乐章。同样为了表达情感，他们可以演出无穷无尽的变奏曲。
    柬埔寨的音乐演奏带给了我们无限的欢乐和信心。他们保存和发展了自己民族乐器，在熟悉的乐器上又演奏了独立和幸福的柬埔寨人民中的曲调。这是一种何等值得钦佩的事情。
    最后，让我来祝福柬埔寨的明珠，也是中柬两国友好的明珠帕花·黛维公主，年轻的夏卡朋王子以及全体艺术家们访问演出胜利成功。（附图片）
