Neijiang's Three-Level Cadre Meeting Distinguishes Major Rural Rights and Wrongs

According to Sichuan Daily news: The Neijiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Sichuan held a county, district, and township three-level cadre meeting from September 12th to 24th. At the meeting, through a great debate on the two roads, the 356 cadres present received a profound education and training, improving their socialist consciousness, and laying a good ideological foundation for leading nearly 600,000 farmers in the county to launch a great unveiling and great debate.

At the beginning of the meeting, some leading cadres were afraid that letting go would be difficult to manage and that it would backfire; grassroots cadres were afraid that after letting go, they would become typical examples of criticism, and cadres with poor performance were prepared to come to the county to be criticized and make self-criticisms. In short, the cadres had many concerns and did not dare to boldly express their opinions. After studying these ideological situations, the Neijiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had the county party secretary deliver a rectification mobilization report. The cadres attending the meeting repeatedly discussed the report, dispelled their concerns, and the great unveiling unfolded in a lively and vigorous manner. They posted many big-character posters and expressed their opinions through forums, individual talks, and other methods, so as to express their opinions freely. The county party committee summarized the opinions expressed in the five days into 246 items, and sincerely accepted most of the correct opinions. On the erroneous remarks concerning the political direction, they guided everyone to launch a great debate.

The Lives of Farmers Have Improved Greatly

At the debate, Wu Xilin, secretary of the second branch of the CCP Yangliu Township, said: "The countryside is getting worse and worse, the lives of farmers are getting worse year by year, the Communist Party is not as good as the Kuomintang, and many party members want to leave the party."

These words aroused the indignation of the cadres present. Chen Shunxiang, a cadre from Anren Township, immediately stood up to refute: "You are simply talking nonsense. The Kuomintang only cared about collecting grain, conscripting laborers, and collecting taxes, and did not care about the life or death of the people. Before liberation, my family farmed the landlord's land. After paying rent and exorbitant taxes, we had nothing to eat or wear. My father was sick and died because he had no money for medical treatment, and my sister starved to death because she had nothing to eat. We had no choice but to live under the eaves of the Huoshen Temple in the sorghum field with my three brothers, sleeping on wet ground and covering ourselves with straw raincoats, living a life that was not human. The Communist Party came and everything changed completely. First, they lent us peas and broad beans to eat, which saved my family. Then they distributed land and fruits, so that we could settle down. Now my family has five large tile houses, several floral quilts, and four or five fattening pigs. Adults all wear blue worker-peasant clothes, and children all wear colorful clothes. If it weren't for the Communist Party, where would such a good life come from? I will never forget the Communist Party in my life, and my children and grandchildren will never forget the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, there would be nothing. Whoever says they don't want the leadership of the Party, I will reason with them."

Tang Zeguang, who used to be a hired worker and is now the head of a cooperative and the secretary of the CCP Gongfu Township branch, said: "I am over sixty years old this year, and I can't finish talking about the past hardships in three days and three nights. In the year of Dingchou, people were starving one by one. Farmers pulled the landlord's hemp leaves to eat, and they were tied up by the landlord and forced to write 'fine words'. Young people have not seen these hard days. What happened when the Communist Party came? If there was no food, they lent grain; if there was no money, they lent money, and if we couldn't repay, they would postpone the repayment, and they would also provide relief to the most difficult. Isn't this better than the Kuomintang? You are blessed but don't know it, but instead you say bad things about the Party, how can that work?" As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes. Finally, he said: "In order not to let my children and grandchildren forget the hard days of the past, I have put away my tattered, patched clothes from before liberation, and I often take them out for them to see, so they know what I used to eat and wear. If you don't believe me, you can go and see my rotten things. You said that many party members want to leave the party, that is completely a rumor, I will never leave the party."

Through such recollections and comparisons, the cadres improved their awareness and criticized Wu Xilin's idea of not wanting the Party's leadership. With everyone's help, Wu Xilin also admitted that he was attacking the Party maliciously from a bourgeois standpoint.

The Cooperative System is Unsurpassed

Li Guoyuan (Communist Youth League member), the armed forces minister of Fengming Township, expressed his dissatisfaction with cooperation and unified purchase and sale. He said: "The cooperative has no advantages. 70% of the cooperatives in our township have reduced production, and 30% of the cooperatives have maintained production; the state purchases too much, people have no food to eat, pigs have no feed, and production will definitely not be good."

As soon as he finished speaking, Hong Baoyu, the secretary of the CCP Fengming Township branch, stood up to refute him: "Where did you investigate that the cooperative reduced production?" He said: "The masses reflected." Hong Baoyu asked again: "Which masses reflected?" But he couldn't say it. Hong Baoyu continued: "You didn't investigate, but I did. Last year, after our township realized advanced agricultural cooperation, agricultural production increased more than in any year, with a grain yield of more than 700 catties per mu and a sugarcane yield of more than 8,000 catties per mu. Among the 43 cooperatives in the township, one increased production by less than 10%, 22 increased production by 10%-20%, 18 increased production by 20%-40%, and 2 increased production by more than 40%. Among the more than 2,390 cooperative members, 2,317 increased their income, 15 maintained their income, and only 59 reduced their income, but their lives are not bad after the cooperative took care of them. Although there were some natural disasters this year, 80% of the cooperatives still increased production. The farmers said that they eat more grain and buy more cloth after joining the cooperative, but you say they eat less grain and buy less cloth. Xin Hua, Fengxiang and other cooperatives have clearly increased dozens of pigs recently, but you insist that the number of pigs has decreased. What are your intentions?"

Ma Chaobing, the head of the Xinchun Cooperative in Zhangjia Township, said: "Whether the cooperative is good or not can also be seen from our cooperative's production, life, and loans. In the spring of 1956, dozens of cooperative members in our cooperative borrowed more than 200 yuan from the state as living expenses. But after the realization of advanced cooperation in the same year, because the cooperative increased production, no household took out a loan, and 50% of the cooperative members still had surplus grain. Among them, Ma Zhaohai's family has 500 catties of old millet and 300 catties of old corn to this day. Isn't this the superiority of the cooperative!"

The Grain Retained is Not Insufficient, But Surplus

When debating Li Guoyuan's argument that "too much grain is purchased, people have no food to eat, and pigs have no feed," the method of combining large and small accounts was adopted. In 1954, the average grain retention per person in the county was 573 catties (including seeds and feed, the same below), 611 catties in 1955, and 635 catties in 1956, and the number of live pigs also increased by tens of thousands. Qing Guangze, the secretary of the CCP Yongdong Township branch, confirmed this with the facts of his township. He said: "According to my investigation, according to the current grain retention standard, there is not enough grain, but there is a surplus, and it is complete nonsense that the lives of farmers are difficult. In our township, 43 of the 47 cooperative members of Sanxing Cooperative had old millet during the grain harvest this year, with a minimum of one or two hundred catties and a maximum of three or four hundred catties. Among the 41 households in the Xingfu Cooperative, 36 households had old grain, of which 8 households had more than 300 catties. Even the 'five-guarantee household' You Shaoqin also had old grain. According to the estimated output of each cooperative, this year each person can still distribute 536 catties of grain, which is slightly more than last year, and 116 catties more than the grain retention standard of 420 catties stipulated by the 'three fixes'. How can it be said that the grain retention standard is lowered year by year?" Zhang Yongxiang, the secretary of the CCP Beimujia Township branch, said: "The grain problem is mainly an ideological problem. Twenty-four cooperatives in our township concealed 21.8 mu of land. Originally, more than 2,000 catties should have been supplied, but after investigation, more than 5,000 catties should be purchased. Li Guoyuan, like these cooperative members, only cares about himself and does not care about the country, and wants to eat all the grain himself. This is truly utter individualism."

Later, Hong Baoyu, the secretary of the CCP Fengming Township branch, asked Li Guoyuan if he had any dissenting opinions. He said with shame: "My family is an old upper-middle peasant, and my father-in-law is a reactionary rich peasant. I have been poisoned by capitalism. Although I have become a cadre and eat the people's food, my position is always on the side of capitalism. This time I have taken a bath, and I must resolutely overcome capitalist ideas."

    启发大鸣大放　引导大争大辩
    内江三级干部会分清农村大是非
    据四川日报消息：　中共四川内江县委于9月12日到24日召开了县、区、乡三级干部会议。会上，通过两条道路的大辩论，使到会的三百五十六个干部受到一次深刻的教育和锻炼，提高了社会主义觉悟，为领导全县近六十万农民展开大鸣大放大争，打下了良好的思想基础。
    会议开始，部分领导干部怕放了不好收拾，怕惹火烧身；基层干部怕放了以后，成为批判的典型，工作差的干部准备到县上来受批评作检讨，总之，干部顾虑重重，不敢大胆鸣放。中共内江县委研究了这些思想情况后，由县委书记作了整风动员报告，与会干部根据报告进行了反复的讨论，解除了顾虑，大鸣大放生动活泼的展开了。他们贴出许多大字报，并用座谈会、个别谈心等方式发表意见，做到了畅所欲言。县委将五天中鸣放出来的意见归纳为二百四十六条，对其中大部分正确的意见表示诚恳接受。对有关政治方向的错误的言论，引导大家展开了大辩论。
    农民生活有很大改善
    在辩论会上，中共杨柳乡二分支部书记吴锡林说：“农村越来越不好，农民生活一年不如一年，共产党不如国民党，很多党员都想离开党。”
    这些话引起到会干部的愤慨。安仁乡干部陈顺祥马上站起来驳斥：“你简直在胡说，国民党只管收粮、拉丁、派款，不管老百姓死活。解放前，我家佃地主的地种，每年去了地租和苛捐杂税，就没吃没穿，父亲有病没钱医拖死了，妹妹没吃的饿死了。没办法，我三兄弟就住在高梁场火神庙的屋檐下，睡湿地，盖蓑衣，过着不像人的生活。共产党来了，完全变了，先是贷给我们豌豆、胡豆吃，把我们一家救出来，接着又分土地、分果实，使我们安了家。现在我家有五间大瓦房，好几床花被子，四、五只架子猪，大人都穿上工农蓝布的衣服，小孩都穿上花衣服，不是共产党哪来的这样好日子呢？我一辈子忘不了共产党，我的子孙后代也忘不了共产党。没有共产党，就没有一切。谁说不要党的领导，我就跟他评理。”
    过去是个雇工，现在当了社长和中共同富乡分支部书记的唐泽光说：“我今年六十多岁了，过去的苦日子我三天三夜也说不完。丁丑年人饿得一条条的，农民扯地主的麻叶吃，还被地主捆起来，逼着写
  ‘罚字’，这些苦日子你们年轻人都没有看到过。共产党来了怎么样呢？没有吃，贷粮，没有钱，贷款，还不起就缓期，对最困难的还救济，这难道不比国民党好吗？你们身在福中不知福，反而还说党的坏话，那能行呢？”讲着讲着他的眼泪涌出来了。最后他说：“我为了不让我的子孙后代忘掉过去的苦日子，我已经把我家解放前穿的襟襟、褛褛，补巴盖补巴的衣服放起来，经常拿给他们看，叫他们知道我过去吃的啥，穿的啥。不信，你也可以去看看我的那些烂东西。你说，很多党员都要离开党，这完全是造谣，我就永远不离开党。”
    通过这样回忆对比，干部们都提高了觉悟，纷纷批判吴锡林不要党的领导的思想。在大家的帮助下，吴锡林也承认了自己是从资产阶级的立场出发，恶意地攻击党。
    合作化制度无比优越
    凤鸣乡武装部长李国元（共青团员）发表了对合作化和统购统销非常不满的意见，他说：“合作社没啥优越性，我们乡有70％的社减产，30％的社保产；国家征购太多，人没吃的，猪没饲料，生产肯定搞不好。”
    他的话刚说完，中共凤鸣乡支部书记洪宝玉就起来驳斥他：“你说合作社减产是从那里调查来的？”他说：“群众反映”。洪宝玉又问：“那些群众反映？”可是他讲不出来。洪宝玉接着说：“你没有调查，我倒调查过。去年咱乡实现高级农业合作化后，农业增产比那年都多，粮食亩产七百多斤，甘蔗亩产八千多斤，全乡四十三个社，增产10％以下的一个，增产10％—20％的二十二个，增产20％—40％的十八个，增产40％以上的二个。二千三百九十多户社员，增收的就占二千三百一十七户；保收的十五户，减收的只五十九户，但是经过社上照顾，他们的生活也不坏。今年虽然有点自然灾害，但是80％的社仍然增产。农民说，入了社吃粮多，买布多，你说吃粮少，买布少。新华、凤祥等社最近明明增加了几十只猪，你偏说减少了猪，到底是何居心？”
    张家乡新春社社长马朝炳说：“合作社到底好不好，从我们社的生产、生活、贷款上也可以看出来。1956年春天我们社有几十户社员向国家贷款二百多元，作为生活费。但同年实现了高级合作化以后，由于社里增了产，就没有一户贷款的了，而且有50％的社员还有余粮，其中较多的马朝海家至今还有老谷子五百斤，老包谷三百斤。这不是合作社的优越性是什么呢！”
    留粮不是不够而是有余
    在辩论李国元提出的“征购太多，人没吃的，猪没饲料”的论点时，采用了算大账与算小账相结合的办法。1954年全县每人平均留粮五百七十三斤（包括种子、饲料，下同），1955年六百一十一斤，1956年六百三十五斤，生猪也随之增加数万头。中共永东乡支部书记卿光泽又用本乡的事实加以证实，他说：“根据我的调查，照目前的留粮标准，口粮不是不够，而是有余，农民生活苦，完全是瞎话。我们乡三星社四十七户社员，今年打谷时，有四十三户有老谷子，少的一、二百斤，多的三、四百斤。幸福社四十一户中，有三十六户有陈粮食，其中有八户在三百斤以上，就连五保户尤少琴也有陈粮食。根据各社估产，今年每人分粮仍可以达到五百三十六斤，比去年略有增加，比三定留粮标准四百二十斤，还多一百一十六斤，这怎能说留粮标准年年降低了呢？”中共椑木乡支部书记张永祥说：“粮食问题，主要是思想问题。我们乡二十四社隐瞒田土面积二十一亩八分，原来应供应二千多斤，查出后应统购五千多斤。李国元也与这些社员一样，光顾个人，不顾国家，想把粮食自家吃完，这真是十足的个人主义。”
    后来，中共凤鸣乡支部书记洪宝玉问李国元有什么不同意的意见，他自愧地说：“我家是老上中农，岳父是个反动富农，我受了资本主义的毒，虽然我当了干部，吃人民的饭，可是我的立场总站在资本主义那面，这次给我洗了个澡，我要坚决克服资本主义思想。”
