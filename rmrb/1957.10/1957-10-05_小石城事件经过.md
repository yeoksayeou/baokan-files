	For more than a month, racists in Little Rock, Arkansas, USA, supported by Governor Faubus, have used the issue of black and white students attending the same school to create riots, attempting to further provoke incidents of persecution against blacks. This has aroused worldwide indignation.

	Little Rock is the capital of Arkansas, with a population of 110,000, a quarter of whom are black. Like other southern cities, black people here are subjected to savage racial discrimination. At the beginning of September, the new school year for primary and secondary schools began. The Federal District Court of Little Rock, in accordance with the 1954 U.S. Federal Supreme Court's order on the abolition of racial segregation in public schools, announced that the city's Central High School would accept black freshmen. For southern racists, the integration of black and white schoolchildren meant the final collapse of the South's traditional segregation system. Therefore, Arkansas Governor Faubus, under the pretext of "preventing riots and maintaining order," dispatched more than 200 fully armed National Guard troops to guard the school area from the start of the school year on September 3, preventing black students from attending school. At the same time, groups of racists gathered in front of the school, hurling insults and threats at black students preparing to enter.

	The unbridled persecution of black people and resistance to federal court orders by southern racists are inseparable from the U.S. government's long-term condoning and appeasement of racists, and its hypocritical attitude toward black people's equal rights. As everyone knows, due to the struggle of the black masses and the pressure of public opinion in the United States, the U.S. Federal Supreme Court issued an order in 1954 to abolish racial segregation in public schools, but the U.S. government has not resolutely implemented this decree. According to "The New York Times," although this decree has been in effect for three years, only more than 700 schools in the seventeen southern and border states have abolished racial segregation. However, within these three years, the southern state legislatures controlled by racists have passed 141 laws to prevent the integration of black and white schoolchildren.

	Eisenhower adopted an appeasing attitude from the beginning towards Arkansas Governor Faubus's use of troops to prevent Central High School from implementing black and white student integration. He emphasized that "laws alone cannot change people's views." In order to cover up his hypocritical attitude towards the issue of racial segregation, Eisenhower held a "meeting" with Faubus on September 14. Afterwards, the two issued empty statements, without indicating any specific actions to be taken on the issue of black and white student integration in Arkansas. Eisenhower's hypocritical attitude was even criticized by the Democratic Party Advisory Committee, saying that he "failed to fulfill his responsibilities" in the Little Rock incident.

	On September 20, although Faubus accepted the Federal District Court order and withdrew the National Guard troops surrounding the school, racists, with his support, surrounded the school again on September 23, beating four black reporters present and using violence to threaten eight black students attending school to leave. Incidents of attacks on black people also occurred successively throughout Little Rock. Thugs also threatened to organize large-scale actions to persecute black people.

	After the riots expanded, due to the severity of the situation, Eisenhower, who was vacationing in Newport, Rhode Island, rushed back to Washington. In order to appease domestic and foreign public opinion, he ordered the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock on the 24th, and announced that the Arkansas National Guard would be "federalized" and commanded by the federal government. At the same time, Eisenhower also delivered a speech to the nation, stating that his dispatch of federal troops to Little Rock was to enforce the decisions of the federal court.

	Facts have proven that the U.S. government's dispatch of federal troops was not truly to protect the rights of black people, but merely a tactic to deceive domestic and foreign public opinion. The day after the federal troops entered Little Rock, Eisenhower made concessions to the racists, promising to negotiate with the five governors selected by the southern states in the near future on the withdrawal of federal troops and the abolition of racial segregation. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson also hinted that the troops would be withdrawn soon, and the most ironic thing is that the Arkansas National Guard, which had previously prevented black children from attending school and is now federalized, has taken over from the Airborne Division to "protect" black children attending school.

    小石城事件经过
    最近一个多月来，美国阿肯色州小石城的种族主义者，在州长福巴斯的支持下，利用黑、白人学生合校问题制造骚乱，企图进一步挑起迫害黑人的事件，这已引起了举世的愤慨。
    小石城是阿肯色州的首府，有居民十一万，黑人占四分之一。和其他南方城市一样，这里的黑人受到野蛮的种族歧视的待遇。9月初，中小学新学年开始。小石城的联邦地方法院，根据1954年美国联邦最高法院关于公立学校取消种族隔离的命令，宣布该市中央中学接受黑人新生。对南方种族主义者说来，黑白人学童合校意味着南方传统的隔离制度最后的崩溃，因此阿肯色州州长福巴斯借口“为了防止暴乱和维持秩序”，从9月3日该校开学之日起，派遣二百余名全副武装的国民警备队，在学校周围布岗，阻止黑人学生上学。同时，成群结队的种族主义者聚集在学校门前，对准备入学的黑人学生施以辱骂和威胁。
    美国南部种族主义者肆无忌惮地迫害黑人和抗拒联邦法院命令，是和美国政府对种族主义者长期纵容姑息，并对黑人平等权利采取虚伪态度分不开的。大家知道，由于美国国内黑人群众的斗争和舆论的压力，美国联邦最高法院才在1954年颁布了关于取消公立学校种族隔离的命令，但是美国政府并未坚决执行这项法令。据“纽约时报”报道，虽然这项法令已经颁布三年，但在南部和边沿十七个州，至今仍然只有七百多个学校已取消种族隔离。然而就在这三年内，由种族主义者把持的南部各州议会却通过了一百四十一条阻止黑白人学童合校的法令。
    艾森豪威尔对阿肯色州长福巴斯使用军队阻止中央中学实行黑白学生合校的行动，从开始就采取姑息态度。他强调“不能仅靠法律来改变人们的看法”。为了掩饰自己对种族隔离问题表现的伪善态度，艾森豪威尔于9月14日同福布斯举行“会谈”，事后两人各自发表空洞的声明，对阿肯色州实行黑白人学生合校问题并没有表示将采取任何具体的行动。艾森豪威尔这种虚伪态度，甚至也受到民主党顾问委员会的指责，说他对小石城事件“没有尽到责任”。
    9月20日，福巴斯虽然接受联邦地方法院命令，撤退了包围学校的国民警卫队。但是在他的支持下，种族主义者在9月23日又包围了学校，殴打在场的四名黑人记者，并用暴力威胁八名上学的黑人学生离校，而小石城内各处也陆续发生袭击黑人事件。暴徒还扬言准备组织大规模迫害黑人的行动。
    暴乱事件扩大后，由于事态的严重，在罗得岛新港度假的艾森豪威尔匆匆赶回华盛顿。他为了缓和国内外舆论，在24日下令101空运师开到小石城，并且宣布将阿肯色州国民警备队“联邦化”，由联邦政府指挥。同时，艾森豪威尔又向全国发表演说，表示他派遣联邦军队前往小石城，是为了执行联邦法院的决定。
    事实证明，美国政府派遣联邦军队并非真正为了保护黑人的权利，只不过是蒙蔽国内外舆论的一种手法。在联邦军队开入小石城第二天，艾森豪威尔就对种族主义分子表示让步，答应在最近和南部各州州长选派的五名州长谈判撤退联邦军队和取消种族隔离问题。同时，美国国防部长威尔逊也暗示不久将撤退军队，而最具讽刺意味的，就是不久前阻止黑人儿童上学现在联邦化了的阿肯色州国民警卫队，已接替空运师“保护”黑人儿童上学了。
