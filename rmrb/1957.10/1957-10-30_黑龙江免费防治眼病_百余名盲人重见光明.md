    Heilongjiang Offers Free Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment
    Over a Hundred Blind People Regain Sight
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Health and the Harbin Medical University jointly formed two teams for blindness prevention. From the end of July to the end of September, they conducted free examinations and treatment for nearly ten thousand farmers and blind people suffering from eye diseases in seven counties including Mingshui, Yilan, and Qinggang. The second team alone, in Mingshui, Qinggang, Lindian and other counties, treated over 3,500 people with medication out of more than 5,000 patients, and over 1,000 people received surgical treatment. Through their prevention and treatment efforts, 160 people who were blind in both eyes regained their sight at the time; more than 240 people were able to gradually regain their sight and improve their vision within three months. The blindness prevention teams also trained more than 30 ophthalmology medical personnel for various counties, enriching the ENT departments, and laying a foundation for these counties to regularly prevent and treat eye diseases and carry out blindness prevention work in the future.

    百余名盲人重见光明
    黑龙江省卫生厅和哈尔滨医学院联合组成了两个防盲工作队，从7月末到9月下旬，分别在明水、依兰、青冈等七个县，为近万名患眼病的农民和盲人进行了免费检查和诊治。仅第二队就在明水、青冈、林甸等县从五千多名患者中，采用药物治疗了三千五百多人，有一千多人得到了手术治疗。通过他们防治的双眼盲人有一百六十名当时复明；有二百四十多人在三个月内能陆续复明和提高视力。防盲队还为各县培养了三十多名眼科医务人员，充实了五官科，为这些县今后经常的防治眼病工作和开展防盲工作打下了基础。　（韦）
