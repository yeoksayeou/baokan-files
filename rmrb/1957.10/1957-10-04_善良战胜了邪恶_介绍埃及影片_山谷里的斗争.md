    Good Conquers Evil
    —Introducing the Egyptian Film "Struggle in the Valley"
    Su Fang
    The theme of the Egyptian film "Struggle in the Valley" is common in general literature and art: the struggle between good people and evil people. However, because the plot of the film develops in a very tortuous and vivid way, and many sudden but reasonable details are richly depicted and expressed, it does not fall into clichés and is novel in every way.
    The beginning of the story originally aroused our pleasant and cheerful emotions. This is not only because the beautiful reflections of the women with water jars on their heads, walking slowly on the riverbank, give people a very peaceful and quiet feeling, but also because it is the harvest season, the season when love matures, and people are singing and dancing wildly, celebrating the harvest and the wedding. However, at such a beautiful moment, disaster suddenly struck. Because the farmers' harvest harmed his interests, the landlord colluded with his nephew, Riyad, to open the sluice gates and release floodwaters to inundate the crops. Then, a vast expanse of water appeared on the screen, along with displaced farmers, and a very low and sorrowful song sounded. This desolate scene formed a sharp contrast with the previous joyous scene. At this point, we were unconsciously brought into the environment in which those people lived. We not only deeply sympathize with the farmers' plight but also hate the creator of the tragedy.
    The landlord's vicious character is gradually deepened as the story develops. The film does not portray him as a person who is obviously a bad guy at first glance. On the surface, he is a gentle and refined gentleman. He is very humble to the farmers and loves his only daughter very much. However, once his interests are touched, his ugly face is exposed. When the village imam guessed that the flood disaster was man-made, he ordered Riyad to assassinate the imam and shift the blame to the honest village chief; when the lackey Hassan might leak his secrets, he ordered Riyad to shoot Hassan; and finally, when Riyad threatened to expose his crimes, he did not hesitate to promise to marry his daughter to this cold-blooded killer.
    The person most severely harmed by the landlord's poisonous scheme, and who is in complete opposition to the landlord, is Ahmed, the son of the village chief. The actor who plays Ahmed very realistically creates the image of this handsome, promising, and upright young man both in appearance and inner emotions. According to the customs of the time, since Ahmed's father was considered the culprit in killing the imam, then the imam's son, Zuleim, must also kill Ahmed. But even under the circumstances that he could be killed by Zuleim at any time, Ahmed was still not discouraged and went to find the real murderer. In order to ask Zuleim to give himself two days to find Hassan, who knew the inside story, he even broke into Zuleim's house. Here, close-up shots of the heads of the masses repeatedly appeared on the screen, their angry eyes focused on Ahmed. This not only shows that he was misunderstood and aroused public anger, and how unfavorable his situation was, but also shows how brave and strong he was. And after he was shot by Zuleim, he still endured the pain to chase Hassan; when he was exhausted, he still fought Riyad in the mosque, which more powerfully proved this point. Ahmed's brave behavior, although expressed as merely stemming from personal grievances; but in reality, by doing so, he would inevitably find out the culprit who destroyed the happiness of their entire village. Therefore, the tense and fierce, life-and-death struggle between Ahmed and Riyad greatly strengthened the dramatic effect, prompting us to care more about Ahmed's fate, and to expect his victory with impatient feelings.
    The ending of the film is very satisfying: the bad guys die one by one, the farmers and Ahmed are reconciled as before, and Ahmed and his beloved girl become a happy couple. Although such an ideal ending has some degree of randomness, it is completely in line with our wishes. And doesn't this also prove the Egyptian people's hatred for evil people and their yearning and aspiration for a better life? In addition, some other characters in the film, such as the village chief, Hassan, Ahmed's lover, etc., are also played very realistically and movingly. Therefore, after watching "Struggle in the Valley," it is not only as exciting as reading a tortuous and complex story, but also provides a certain degree of satisfaction in terms of artistic enjoyment.

    善良战胜了邪恶
    ——介绍埃及影片“山谷里的斗争”
    苏方
    埃及影片“山谷里的斗争”的主题是一般文学艺术作品所常有的：善良的人同邪恶的人之间的斗争。但是由于影片故事情节的发展非常曲折生动，许多突如其来、但又合乎情理的细节也得到了丰满的描写和表现，因此便能不落窠臼，处处别开生面了。
    故事的开始本来激起了我们愉悦欢快的情绪。这不仅是因为那一列头顶水罐、在河岸上缓缓而行的女人的美丽倒影，给予人十分安恬和娴静的感觉，而且因为这时正是收成的时节，爱情成熟的时节，人们正在狂歌热舞，庆祝丰收，庆祝婚礼的缘故。然而就在这样美好的时刻，灾难突然降临了。庄主因为农民的丰收危害了自己的利益，便和外甥里亚德合谋，打开水闸，放出洪水淹没了庄稼。于是银幕上出现了汪洋大水，出现了流离失所的农民，并且响起了非常低沉悲怆的歌声，这种荒凉的景象和前面的欢愉的景象形成了鲜明的对比，至此，我们也不自觉地被带进那些人所处的环境之中。我们不仅深深同情农民的遭遇，也会切齿痛恨那个悲剧的制造者。
    狠毒成性的庄主的性格是随着故事的发展逐渐深化的。影片没有把他描绘成一个一望而知是坏人的人。从表面上看，他是一个文质彬彬的绅士，他对农民很谦和，对于自己的独生女儿也很疼爱。然而一旦他的利益被触犯的时候，他的丑恶面目也就随着暴露了。当村中阿訇猜测洪水灾害是人为的的时候，他便叫里亚德暗害了阿訇，并且把罪行转嫁给忠厚老实的村长；当狗腿子哈桑可能泄露他的秘密的时候，他又叫里亚德去枪杀哈桑；而最后当里亚德以揭穿他的罪行来威胁他的时候，他竟不惜答应将女儿嫁给这个杀人不眨眼的刽子手。
    被庄主的毒计伤害得最厉害，和庄主处在完全对立的位置上的，是村长的儿子阿赫默德。扮演阿赫默德的演员从外形和内在情感上都很真切地创造了这个英俊有为、刚正不阿的年青人的形象。按照当时风习，阿赫默德的父亲既然被认为是杀死阿訇的罪人，那么阿訇的儿子宙立姆也必须杀死阿赫默德。但是即使在随时可能被宙立姆杀死的情况下，阿赫默德仍然毫不气馁地去寻找真正的凶手。为了要求宙立姆给自己两天时间寻找知道内情的哈桑，他甚至亲自闯到宙立姆家里去。在这里，银幕上反复出现了几次群众头部的特写镜头，他们愤怒的目光都集中在阿赫默德身上。这不仅说明他被误解地激起了众怒，他的处境多么不利，同时也显现出他是多么勇敢坚强。而他被宙立姆击中以后，仍然忍着痛楚追赶哈桑；在他筋疲力竭的时候，仍然在清真寺中和里亚德搏斗等等，就更加有力地证明了这一点。阿赫默德的勇敢行为，虽然表现为仅仅是出于个人恩怨；但实际上，他这样做，就必然会寻找出那破坏了他们全村幸福的罪人。因此阿赫默德和里亚德之间的那场紧张激烈、生死攸关的搏斗，大大加强了戏剧效果，促使我们更加关怀阿赫默德的命运，并且以迫不急待的心情期望着他的胜利。
    影片的结尾是大快人心的：坏人一个一个地死了，农民和阿赫默德和好如初，阿赫默德和他心爱的姑娘结成了幸福的伴侣。虽然这样理想的结局带有若干程度的偶然性，但是却是完全合乎我们的愿望的。而这不也证明埃及人民对于邪恶的人的憎恨和对于美好的生活的憧憬和向往么？加之影片中的其它一些人物，如村长、哈桑、阿赫默德的爱人等，演得也极真实动人，因此看过“山谷里的斗争”以后，便不仅是像读了一个曲折复杂的故事那样令人振奋，在艺术享受方面，也获得一定的满足了。
