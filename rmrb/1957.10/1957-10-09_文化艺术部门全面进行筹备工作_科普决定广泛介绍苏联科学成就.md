Xinhua News Agency, 8th -- The All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, will launch a nationwide publicity campaign to widely introduce the scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union. The main content of the publicity will be the major achievements of the Soviet Union in socialist construction and science and technology over the past forty years, the advanced nature of Soviet science and technology, and the comprehensive, enormous, and sincerely selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country.

The National Science Popularization Association recently issued a notice stating that introducing the glorious achievements and scientific and technological accomplishments of the Soviet Union over the past forty years to the broad masses of people is an important current publicity task. Through this publicity, we will powerfully counter the absurd remarks of bourgeois rightists who slander the Soviet Union and undermine Sino-Soviet unity, make the broad masses firmly believe in the superiority of the socialist system, further learn from the advanced science and technology and construction experience of the Soviet Union, and transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country as soon as possible.

At present, the National Science Popularization Association is rushing to print and send a large number of publicity materials to various regions. These include six types of pictures and albums co-edited with the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association: "The Great Forty Years of the Soviet Union," "The Great Sino-Soviet Friendship," "Soviet Industrial Construction," "Soviet Agriculture," "Soviet Science," and "Soviet Cultural and Educational Undertakings," as well as more than thirty written publicity materials. In addition, the China Lantern Slide Company is rushing to produce lantern slides based on the content of the exhibition pictures to supply to various regions.

Currently, local science popularization organizations are also actively preparing for publicity activities. The Zhejiang and Shaanxi branches have respectively notified organizations at all levels within the provinces to promote to the broad masses through various forms of publicity such as lectures, exhibitions, films, slides, blackboards, and broadcasts.

    科普决定广泛介绍苏联科学成就
    新华社8日讯　中华全国科学技术普及协会为庆祝苏联十月革命四十周年，将在全国范围内举行一次广泛的介绍苏联科学技术成就的宣传活动。宣传的主要内容是介绍苏联四十年来社会主义建设和科学技术上的重大成就，苏联科学技术的先进性，以及苏联对我国全面的、巨大的、真诚无私的援助。
    全国科普在最近发出了通知，通知说，向广大人民介绍苏联建国四十年来的辉煌成绩和科学技术上的成就，是当前一项重要的宣传任务。通过这次宣传，有力地反击资产阶级右派诬蔑苏联、破坏中苏团结的荒谬言论，使广大群众确信社会主义制度的优越性，进一步学习苏联的先进科学技术和建设的经验，把我国尽快地由落后的农业国变成先进的工业国。
    目前，全国科普正在赶印和向各地寄发大批宣传资料。其中包括同中苏友协总会共同编辑的“伟大的苏联四十年”、“伟大的中苏友谊”、“苏联的工业建设”、“苏联的农业”、“苏联的科学”、“苏联的文教事业”等六种图片、画册，以及文字宣传资料三十多篇。另外，中国幻灯公司正在根据展览图片内容赶制幻灯片，供应各地。
    现在，科普地方组织也都在积极筹备宣传活动，浙江、陕西分会已分别通知省内各级组织，通过讲演、展览、电影、幻灯、黑板报、广播等多种宣传形式，向广大人民宣传。
