The great October Socialist Revolution inaugurated a new era in human history, illuminating the path to liberation for all mankind and for women worldwide. The Soviet Union, for the first time, declared to the world through its vivid example how the women's question could be thoroughly resolved, how to truly eliminate the ugly customs of social oppression and humiliation of women, how to guide women themselves to break free from the shackles of traditional ideas, become masters of their own destiny, and consciously and actively participate in the construction of socialism-communism.

Forty years is an extremely short period in the entire history of mankind, and only a brief period compared to the history of thousands of years of class society. However, in these forty years, the Soviet Union, on the foundation laid by the great October Socialist Revolution, carried out a series of unprecedented great changes. The fundamental change in the status of women is only one example of these great changes. Lenin said: "The Soviet regime is the regime of the workers. In the early years of its existence, the most decisive reforms were carried out in legislation concerning women. Those laws that placed women in a subordinate position have not left a trace in the Soviet Republic." He also said: "This is only the first step in the emancipation of women. But no bourgeois republic, even the most democratic, has dared to take such a first step." Those women who were completely enslaved and oppressed before the October Revolution, after the October Revolution, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, and under the protection of the Soviet regime, were tempered and improved politically, ideologically, culturally, technically, and in terms of their labor capacity in the struggle to defend the fruits of the revolution and build socialism. Today, Soviet women have made outstanding contributions in the construction of socialism and communism and enjoy complete equal rights and a high social status in society, which is absolutely impossible in capitalist countries. Currently, women account for 25.8% of the deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; women account for 45.4% of the total number of employees in the Soviet Union; women account for 53% of experts with higher education; women account for 41% of agronomists, breeders, veterinarians, and foresters with higher education; and women account for an even larger proportion in medical and educational work, such as female doctors accounting for 76% of the total number of doctors and female teachers accounting for 70% of the total number of teachers. In terms of reserve forces for various national construction projects, women also account for a high proportion. Female students account for 52.3% of the total number of students in universities, and female students account for 54.8% of the total number of students in secondary schools. There is no need to list more figures to illustrate that the path to women's liberation opened up by the October Revolution is the only correct path that can truly liberate women, which is also a clear proof of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The complete emancipation of Soviet women is a sign of the great victory of Marxism-Leninism on the theory of women's liberation.

However, the Soviet people encountered many difficulties on the road forward, and they advanced by constantly overcoming these difficulties. In the early days of the establishment of the Soviet regime, the newborn country suffered from the invasion of imperialism and the rebellion of domestic counter-revolutionaries, so that they could only build their new life under extremely difficult conditions. At that time, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, the Soviet people firmly believed in the righteousness of their cause, unswervingly followed the path of socialism-communism, combined their personal interests with the interests of the country and the collective, fully developed the spirit of hard struggle, building the country and managing the household diligently and thriftily, and overcame all kinds of difficulties with strong perseverance, so that they were finally able to build the Soviet Union into a great country with modern industry, modern agriculture, highly developed culture and science and technology, and transitioning to communism.

Soviet women firmly believe that only socialism will bring women complete liberation and a happy and beautiful life. When the socialist motherland and the people suffered difficulties, they bravely participated in the struggle to defend the cause of socialist revolution along with the people of the whole country. They also played a huge role in encouraging their husbands, children, and relatives to actively participate in the struggle. During the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, heroic Soviet women flocked to the front lines in large numbers, directly participating in and serving the war. The image of Zoya, a heroine who was unyielding in the face of the enemy, will always live in our hearts. An even larger number of women sent their husbands and sons to the front lines and shouldered the heavy burden of production in the rear; they tightened their belts, supported the war, and helped the country adopt orphans who lost their parents during the war. Their situation at that time was indeed very difficult, but no difficulty could make the heroic Soviet women succumb. A high degree of communist consciousness tempered their will like steel, and they persisted in fighting, working, and living until they achieved final victory.

In the years of peace, Soviet women intertwined their love for the motherland, their love for the cause of communism, and their love for a peaceful life into their ordinary daily work, so they were full of joy, wisdom, and creativity in their work. Many women have become creators of new records, innovators of production, proponents of rationalization, and inventors. More than one million female workers in the Soviet Union have been awarded Soviet medals and orders, and two thousand three hundred and fifty-nine women have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. Among the sixteen Heroes of Socialist Labor who have received a second "Hammer and Sickle" gold medal, ten are women. It is precisely because of the creative labor of millions of men and women with a high degree of communist consciousness that the Soviet Union's labor productivity can continue to increase, the income of the working people can continue to increase, prices can continue to decrease, and the material and cultural needs of the people can be better met. Soviet women, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have brought together their labor and creativity with the labor and creativity of the entire Soviet people, creating huge wealth for the country, saving huge wealth for the country, and creating an increasingly better life for themselves.

The noble quality of Soviet women lies in their love of labor and their faithful display of creative labor. The concept of "integrating one's small labor into the great cause of communist construction for the benefit of the people and future generations" has taken root in the minds of Soviet women and has become one of their most beautiful qualities. This view enables them to promote the spirit of hard struggle and building the country diligently and thriftily, whether in wartime or peacetime construction, under difficult material living conditions or affluent material living conditions, and in physical or mental labor positions, so as to make greater contributions to the glorious task of completing the transition to communism as soon as possible. They can work diligently on any ordinary job for more than ten or even decades. Whether they are female workers, peasant women, or state organ staff, whether they are engineers, doctors, teachers, tractor drivers, breeders, agronomists, accountants, typists, statisticians, or service personnel in hotels, restaurants, barber shops, etc., they all love their professions, persevere with full enthusiasm, and work hard to delve into them. A very ordinary female member of a collective farm, Liuskova, became a nationally famous pig-raising expert because of her love for her pig-raising work. She can make an ordinary sow reproduce piglets with a total weight of about 5,000 kilograms per year, which makes a sow a living "meat production factory." All livestock textbooks introduce her pig-raising methods. An academician of the Academy of Sciences published an article in the newspaper saying: "The work of pig-raising expert Liuskova... has opened up many new avenues in science. We academicians of the Academy of Sciences recognize her as one of our scholars in the scientific community and admit that she is a scientific doctor without a diploma for the time being." Soviet women regard labor as a glorious and heroic cause and believe that there is no distinction between high and low labor. As long as it is labor that is beneficial to the country and the collective, it is noble, important, and beneficial to themselves. The emergence of labor heroes does not depend on the choice of profession, but on the correct views and attitudes of the workers.

Soviet women are not only completely equal members of society with men, but as women and mothers, they have not forgotten their responsibilities to their families and children. They create family happiness with their labor. In socialist families, housework, like other labor, has become a necessary labor in people's lives, and women engaged in housework are highly respected and intimately cared for by society and the country. Whether housework is undertaken by women or by men, women, old and young, in the family, family members are based on a new relationship of complete equality, mutual assistance, and cooperation, and are firmly linked together by love and kinship; this is a reflection of the superior socialist system in family life. Lidia Ivanovna, a female scholar of optical science with eight children, personally manages the housework. When she returns home after work, she and her children share the work of cooking, washing clothes, and cleaning the house, creating a harmonious, loving, and vibrant atmosphere for the family. Anyone who has seen the novel or movie "The Zhurbin Family" will, like the Zhurbin family, be in awe of the hostess in charge of the household, Akkafia Karpovna. Apart from the children, she is the only one in the family who is not in a production position. She is responsible for managing the household, and her labor has become a necessary condition for ensuring the active participation of all family members in social production; she, like other members of the Zhurbin family, is an equal worker. Without her, it would be impossible for this family to carry out production and life normally. Therefore, the labor of this housewife is completely socially significant.

The family life of the Soviet people is very frugal. Ivan Rumanov, a veteran foreman of a steel plant, said well: "Our family life is thrifty, not because we don't have enough money. Diligence and thrift are the guarantee of our prosperous life. Diligence and thrift are only for the purpose of planning to make family life better. Diligence and thrift are also the virtues of a socialist family." These words express the basic attitude of millions of Soviet people towards diligence and thrift. Soviet women have been and are constantly practicing and enriching it with various specific actions of diligence and thrift. Some workers' families grow their own fruit trees and vegetables, so that they do not have to buy these foods from the market all year round. Soviet people's families attach great importance to savings and purchasing government bonds, investing their savings in the construction of the motherland, and closely linking the continuous prosperity and beauty of family life with the cause of national construction.

Soviet women attach particular importance to the education of their children. In the Soviet Union, the new generation is educated by the state and society, but this does not diminish the role and significance of the family. They regard educating their children to become active and conscious builders of communism as the most important social function of the family; it is stipulated as the most important civic duty of parents. The education of children in Soviet families is centered on labor education. From the time their children are young, parents cultivate their good qualities and habits of loving labor, being diligent and thrifty, and pay special attention to influencing children with their own exemplary actions. For example, if parents themselves love the labor they are engaged in, respect the achievements of others' labor, care about the difficulties of comrades, and cherish public property, they can set an example and cultivate children to grow up to love socialism, love labor, and have good qualities of being able to endure hardship, be self-restrained and humble, and be steadfast and brave. At the same time, they also pay attention to helping children master the skills of handling housework, consciously encourage boys to learn the most basic gardening, masonry carpentry, and other handicrafts, and encourage girls to learn embroidery, sewing, cooking, etc. They do this so that whether now or in the future, children will be happy to do any work that needs to be done, and do it with a diligent attitude; and so that they will not be afraid of any difficulties and overcome any difficulties under various living conditions. This practice of cultivating communist virtues from an early age can not only help a child become an honest and capable worker in the future, bringing happiness to the family, but also has a positive and far-reaching impact on firmly establishing a communist moral atmosphere in the whole society. This is why Soviet families and women regard the education of children, especially educating children to love labor, as an extremely important and sacred duty.

"Following the path of Soviet women's liberation" and "Learning from Soviet women" are the consistent and unwavering beliefs of Chinese women. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow, and the experience of the Soviet Union's construction over the past forty years is the best example and the most valuable wealth for our country's socialist construction. The main reason why our country's socialist construction has been able to develop so rapidly after the establishment of New China is due to the assistance of the Soviet Union and the results of advanced Soviet technology and equipment. Therefore, as long as we earnestly and humbly learn from the Soviet Union, we will take fewer detours and make fewer mistakes on the road of socialist construction, and our motherland will become increasingly prosperous and strong according to our expected wishes. Unwaveringly combining with China's actual situation to learn from the Soviet Union is not only a great benefit for the people of our country, but also one of the most important conditions for our country to build socialism.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Chinese women, following the path opened up by the October Revolution and taking Soviet women as an example, bravely and actively participated in the people's revolutionary struggle and socialist construction, and made outstanding achievements; now, under the superior socialist system, Chinese women have achieved liberation. In all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life, they have obtained equal rights and status with men and have become a huge and indispensable force in the construction of socialism. However, our country's socialist transformation has just been basically completed, and socialist construction is only the beginning. The tasks before us are arduous. We must continue to build and consolidate our country's socialist system and continue to achieve the complete victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts; we must concentrate all our efforts to develop our country's social productive forces, and strive to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry and modern agriculture in another ten to fifteen years, so that women and children can live a better life. Therefore, we must better learn from the glorious example of Soviet women and more firmly follow the Communist Party on the socialist road. We must earnestly learn from the spirit of hard struggle, building the country diligently and thriftily, and managing the household diligently and thriftily of Soviet women, so that every woman can treat the production and work she is engaged in, manage her family, and influence the people and family members around her with this spirit. More widely and firmly establishing the atmosphere of diligence and thrift in society will have a major positive effect on our country's socialist construction. We must comprehensively and deeply learn from the noble communist moral qualities of Soviet women and further deepen the mutual understanding between Chinese and Soviet women, which will help to further enhance the unbreakable unity and friendship between the people of the two countries, thereby helping to further develop and consolidate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and jointly make greater contributions to world peace and the cause of human progress.

    只有十月革命的道路才是妇女解放的道路
    蔡畅
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，开创了人类历史的新纪元，照亮了全人类解放的道路，照亮了全世界妇女解放的道路。苏联，第一个用自己生动的事实，向全世界宣告了妇女问题怎样才可以得到彻底解决，怎样才能真正消除社会上种种压迫和侮辱妇女的丑恶习俗，怎样才能引导妇女自己摆脱传统观念的束缚，成为自己命运的主人，自觉地积极参加社会主义——共产主义的建设。
    四十年，在人类整个历史上是极为短暂的，和几千年的阶级社会的历史相比，也只是一个很短的时期。但是苏联却在四十年中，在伟大的十月社会主义革命所奠定的基础上，进行了一系列的史无前例的大变革，妇女地位的根本变化，只不过是这些大变革中一个事例。列宁说过：“苏维埃政权乃是劳动者的政权。在它存在的最初岁月，在关于妇女的立法上，就进行了最果断的改革。那些将妇女置于服从地位的法律，在苏维埃共和国里没有留下一点儿痕迹了。”他还说到：“这只是妇女解放的第一步罢了。但是没有一个资产阶级共和国，即使是最民主的也罢，曾敢于采取这样的第一步。”那些在十月革命前，完全处在被奴役、被压迫中的妇女，在十月革命以后，在布尔什维克党领导下，在苏维埃政权的保障下，在保卫革命胜利果实的斗争和建设社会主义事业中，她们在政治上、思想上、文化技术上和劳动能力上都受到了锻炼和提高。今天的苏联妇女已经在社会主义、共产主义建设中创造了卓越的贡献，在社会上已享有完全的平等权利和崇高的社会地位，这些是资本主义国家绝对做不到的。目前，在苏联最高苏维埃代表中，妇女占25.8％；在全苏联职工总数中，妇女占45.4％，在具有高等教育程度的专家中，妇女占53％，在具有高等教育程度的农艺师、饲养员、兽医、林学家等当中，妇女占41％；在医务、教育工作中，妇女所占的比例更大，如妇女医师占医师总数的76％，女教师占教师总数的70％；在为国家各种建设提供的后备力量方面，妇女的比例同样很高，在高等学校中，女生占学生总数的52.3％，在中等学校中，女生占学生总数的54.8％。用不着再列举更多的数字就已经可以说明十月革命所开辟的妇女解放的道路，是唯一能真正使妇女获得解放的正确道路，这也正是社会主义制度无比优越的一个明证。苏联妇女的彻底解放是马克思列宁主义关于妇女解放理论的伟大胜利的标志。
    但是苏联人民在前进的道路上是遇到过许多困难的，他们是在不断克服这些困难中前进的。在苏维埃政权建立的初期，新生的国家遭受着帝国主义的侵犯和国内反革命分子的叛乱，以致他们只能在十分困难的条件下建设自己的新生活。那时，苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，坚信自己事业的正义性，坚定不移地走社会主义——共产主义的道路，把个人的利益和国家、集体的利益结合起来，充分发扬了艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国、勤俭持家的精神，用坚强的毅力克服种种困难，为国家的富强、集体的繁荣进行忘我的劳动，所以才终于能够把苏联建成为具有现代化的工业、现代化的农业、高度发展的文化和科学技术，并向共产主义过渡的伟大国家。
    苏联妇女坚信，只有社会主义才会给妇女带来彻底的解放和美好幸福的生活，在社会主义祖国和人民遭受困难的时候，她们和全国人民一道勇敢地参加了为捍卫社会主义革命事业的斗争。她们在鼓励自己的丈夫、子女及亲人积极进行斗争方面，也起了巨大的作用。在苏联伟大卫国战争期间，英勇的苏联妇女大批地奔赴前线，直接参加战争、为战争服务。在敌人面前坚贞不屈的英雄卓娅的形象，永远活在我们的心里。还有更广大的妇女把丈夫和儿子送上前线，挑起了后方生产的重担；她们节衣缩食，支援战争，并帮助国家收养战时失去父母的孤儿。当时她们的处境确是非常艰难的，但是无论什么困难，都不能使英雄的苏联妇女屈服。高度的共产主义的觉悟把她们的意志锻炼得像钢铁一样，她们坚持斗争着、劳动着、生活着，直到取得最后胜利。
    在和平的年月里，苏联妇女把对祖国的热爱、对共产主义事业的热爱、对和平生活的热爱，交织在平凡的日常劳动中，因而她们在劳动中充满着快乐、智慧和创造性。许多妇女成了新纪录创始者、生产革新者、合理化建议者和发明家。苏联已有一百多万妇女劳动者获得了苏联的勋章和奖章，有二千三百五十九位妇女获得了社会主义劳动英雄的称号，在十六位获得了第二枚“镰刀锤子”金质奖章的社会主义劳动英雄中，有十位是妇女。也正是因为千百万有高度共产主义觉悟的男女群众的创造性的劳动，苏联的劳动生产率才能不断地提高，劳动人民的收入才能不断地增加，物价才能不断地减低，人民的物质、文化生活的需要才能得到更大的满足。苏联妇女就是这样在共产党的领导下，把自己的劳动和创造，和全苏联人民的劳动和创造汇集在一起，为国家创造了巨大的财富，为国家节约了巨大的财富，并为自己创造日益美好的生活。
    苏联妇女的崇高品质，就在于她们热爱劳动、忠诚地发挥创造性的劳动。“把自己微小的劳动，溶汇在伟大的共产主义建设事业中，为人民和后代造福”的观念，已在苏联妇女的思想中生根，并成为她们最美的品质之一。这种观点，使她们不论是在战争时期或和平建设时期，在物质生活条件困难或物质生活富裕的情况下，在体力劳动或脑力劳动的岗位上，都能发扬艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国的精神，为早日完成向共产主义过渡的光荣任务而作出更大的贡献。她们对任何一件平凡的工作，都能勤勤恳恳地干上十几年甚至几十年。不论是女工、农妇或国家机关工作人员，不论是工程师、医师、教员，不论是拖拉机手、饲养员、农艺师，不论是会计员、打字员、统计员，不论是旅馆、餐厅、理发店的服务员等等，她们都热爱自己的职业，精神饱满地坚持干下去，下苦功钻下去。一个极普通的集体农庄女庄员刘斯科娃，由于热爱自己的养猪工作而成为全国闻名的养猪能手。她能使一条普通的母猪在一年内生殖小猪的总重量达到五千公斤左右，简直使一条母猪成了一个活的“产肉工厂”。所有养畜业的教科书都介绍了她养猪的方法。一位科学院的院士在报上发表文章说：“养猪专家刘斯科娃的工作，……在科学中开辟了许多新途径。我们科学院院士公认她是我们科学界学者之一，并承认她是暂时无文凭的科学博士。”苏联妇女就这样把劳动当作光荣的豪迈的事业，并认为劳动是没有贵贱的区别的，只要是有利于国家和集体的劳动，都是崇高的，都是重要的，也都是对自己有利的。劳动英雄的出现，不决定于选择了什么样的职业，而是在于劳动者要有正确的观点和态度。
    苏联妇女不仅已是社会上和男子完全平等的成员，作为女性和母亲，她们也没有忘记对家庭、对子女的职责。她们用自己的劳动创造家庭的幸福。在社会主义家庭中，家务劳动和其他劳动一样，成为人们的生活中必需的劳动，从事家务劳动的妇女受到了社会和国家的很高尊重和亲密的关怀。家务劳动不管由妇女来承担或由家庭男女老少分别承担，家庭成员之间是建立在一种完全平等的互助合作的新关系上，以爱情和血亲关系把他们巩固地联系在一起；这正是优越的社会主义社会制度在家庭生活中的反映。有八个孩子的女学者、光学博士丽吉娅·伊万诺夫娜亲自管理家务，工作完毕回到家中，和她的儿女们分工处理烧菜、洗衣、打扫房子等工作，为这个家庭创造了和睦、友爱和蓬勃的朝气。看过“茹尔宾一家”这部小说或电影的人，都会和茹尔宾一家人一样对主持家务的女主人——阿卡菲亚·卡尔波芙娜肃然起敬。全家人中除了小孩，只有她没有在生产岗位上，她负责料理家务，她的劳动成为保证了全家人积极参加社会生产的必要条件；她和茹尔宾全家其他成员一样，是平等的劳动者，没有她，这一家人要正常地进行生产和生活，是不可能的。因此，这位主妇的劳动，是完全具有社会意义的。
    苏联人民的家庭生活是很节约的，一位钢铁厂的老工长依万·鲁马诺夫说得好：“我们的家庭生活厉行节约，并非由于钱少不够用。勤劳节约，是我们富裕生活的保证。勤劳节约，只是为了有计划地使家庭生活过得更好。勤劳节约，也是社会主义家庭的美德。”这几句话表达了千百万苏联人民对勤俭持家的基本态度。苏联妇女已经并正在用着各种勤俭的具体行动，不断地实践它和充实它。有些工人的家庭，自己种植果树、蔬菜，做到一年四季不到市场上去购买这些食品。苏联人民的家庭都十分重视储蓄和购买公债，把他们的积蓄，投在祖国的建设事业上，把家庭生活不断的富裕、美好，紧紧地和国家建设事业联系在一起。
    苏联妇女对子女的教育给予了特别的重视。在苏联，新生的一代是由国家和社会来教育的，但这决不因此而减低了家庭的作用和意义。他们把教育子女成为共产主义积极的自觉的建设者，当作家庭的最重要的社会职能；规定为做父母的最重要的公民义务。苏联家庭对子女的教育是以劳动教育为中心内容的。从子女幼小的时候开始，父母就培养他们热爱劳动、勤俭朴素的良好品质和习惯，并且特别注意以父母本身的模范行动，来影响儿童。例如父母本身能热爱自己所从事的劳动，尊重别人的劳动成就、关心同志的困难，与爱护公共财物，就能以身作则，培养儿童长成为热爱社会主义，热爱劳动，具有能吃苦耐劳、克己谦逊、坚毅勇敢的良好品质。同时他们还注意帮助儿童掌握处理家务劳动的本领，有意识地鼓励男孩子们学会最基本的园艺、泥水木匠等手工艺，鼓励女孩子们学会刺绣、缝纫、烹调等。她们这样做，是为了使孩子们不论是现在或将来，对任何一件需要他们去做的工作，都会很高兴地去做，而且用勤恳的态度去做；也使他们在各种生活条件下，不怕任何困难，克服任何困难。这种从小就开始培养共产主义美德的做法，不仅能帮助一个孩子将来成为正直能干的劳动者，给家庭带来幸福，而且对于在整个社会上巩固地树立起共产主义道德风气方面，更有着积极的深远的影响。这也就是苏联的家庭和妇女，把教育子女，特别是教育子女热爱劳动，当作一项极为重要的神圣的职责来看待的原故。
      “走苏联妇女解放的道路”，“向苏联妇女学习”，是我国妇女一贯的坚定不移的信念。苏联的今天，就是我们的明天，苏联四十年来建设的经验，是我国进行社会主义建设的最好的榜样和最宝贵的财富。新中国建立后，我国社会主义建设所以能够这样迅速的发展，主要原因之一是由于苏联的援助和苏联先进技术装备的结果。所以说，只要我们认真和虚心的向苏联学习，就会使我们在社会主义建设的道路上少走弯路和少犯错误，就会使我们的祖国按照我们预期的愿望日益繁荣和富强起来。坚定不移的结合中国实际的向苏联学习，不但是我国人民莫大的利益，而且是我国建成社会主义的最重要条件之一。
    我国妇女，在中国共产党的领导下，循着十月革命所开辟的道路，以苏联妇女为榜样，英勇地积极地参加了人民革命斗争和社会主义建设，做出了出色的成就；现在在优越的社会主义制度下，我国妇女已经实现了解放，不论在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面，都获得了和男子平等的权利与地位，并成为建设社会主义事业的一支巨大的不可缺少的力量。但是我国社会主义改造刚刚基本完成，社会主义建设只是开端，摆在我们面前的任务是艰巨的。我们要继续建成和巩固我国的社会主义制度，在政治战线上思想战线上继续取得社会主义革命的彻底胜利；要集中一切力量来发展我国的社会生产力，争取再经过十年到十五年时间，把我国建成为具有现代化工业和现代化农业的伟大的社会主义国家，使妇女儿童能够过着更美好的生活。因此我们要更好地学习苏联妇女的光辉榜样，更坚定不移地跟着共产党走社会主义道路。我们要认真地学习苏联妇女艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国、勤俭持家的精神，使我们每个妇女都能以勤俭建国、勤俭持家的精神，对待自己所从事的生产、工作，处理自己的家庭，并以此精神影响自己周围的人和家庭的成员。在社会上更广泛更巩固地树立勤俭的风气，这是对我国社会主义建设事业，有重大的积极作用的。我们要全面而深刻地学习苏联妇女崇高的共产主义道德品质，更加深中苏两国妇女的相互了解，这将有助于更增进两国人民牢不可破的团结和友谊，从而有助于更加发展和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，共同为世界和平和人类进步事业作出更大的贡献。
