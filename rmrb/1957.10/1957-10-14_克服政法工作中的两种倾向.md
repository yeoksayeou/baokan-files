Recently, a series of political and legal work conferences have been held from the central to the provincial and municipal levels, focusing on criticizing two tendencies in political and legal work, namely, the tendency to neglect dictatorship and the tendency to neglect the leadership of the Party. Judging from the materials reflected by these conferences, the problem is serious. Unless these two serious tendencies are overcome, not only will the anti-Rightist struggle on the political and legal front not be able to be carried out vigorously, but also the revolutionary tasks on the political and legal front will not be able to be completed correctly. In view of the wide extent and seriousness of these two tendencies, it is necessary to mobilize political and legal workers at all levels across the country to further criticize these two tendencies, so as to lead the political and legal work onto a completely correct path.

Should the political and legal organs exercise dictatorship over counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, exploiting class elements who adhere to reactionary standpoints, and all elements who endanger socialist construction, resolutely crack down on and punish them, or, on the contrary, condone and protect them? This question, which should not have become a problem, has, for a period of time, become quite confused in the minds of some comrades in the political and legal departments. These comrades have forgotten that the political and legal organs are the weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship.

When inspecting political and legal work, this right-leaning thought was clearly manifested. They only paid attention to inspecting cases of light crimes being judged heavily, and did not pay attention to inspecting cases of serious crimes being judged lightly; they only paid attention to inspecting wrong cases, and did not pay attention to what counter-revolutionaries and other reactionaries were missed. In their eyes, it seemed that only heavy sentences for light crimes were illegal, while letting enemies go, exonerating enemies, and missing enemies were legal.

In the implementation of the policy of combining punishment with leniency, right-leaning thought was also very obvious. After the second suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1955 and after the completion of the three major transformations in 1956, our country was more consolidated, and the Party and the government believed that the policy towards counter-revolutionaries could be appropriately relaxed. This is completely correct. Some comrades understood this measure from a rightist perspective. On the one hand, they used this to criticize the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement in 1955, not talking about achievements or talking about them less, talking more about mistakes or only talking about mistakes; on the other hand, they seriously relaxed the current struggle against the enemy. In terms of judicial work, the phenomenon of not sentencing when should be sentenced, and light sentences for serious crimes was seen, and one-sided emphasis was placed on lenient treatment, and lenient treatment was also given to cases that should be severely punished. In terms of procuratorial work, the phenomenon of not arresting when should be arrested was also very serious. In terms of public security work, it was a relaxation of control work. Insufficient control was exercised over those under control, control was not implemented over those who should be controlled, and control was revoked for those who should not have been revoked.

The fundamental reason why some comrades in the political and legal organs have this right-leaning thought is that they do not have a clear understanding of the current situation of class struggle in our country.

What are the characteristics of the current situation of class struggle in our country? This is: whether in cities or in the countryside, there is still a struggle between socialism and capitalism. Completely solving this problem is the task of the entire transition period. The basic victory of the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production in 1956 does not mean that the socialist revolution has been completed, and especially does not mean that the class struggle has ended. After the change in ownership, the political and ideological struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat has not ended. The recent frenzied attacks on the Party and socialism by bourgeois rightists, as well as the opportunity taken by reactionary elements among landlords and rich peasants and other counter-revolutionary elements to attempt to settle accounts and restore capitalism, creating disturbances, show that this struggle can still reach a very sharp degree under certain conditions. Therefore, throughout the entire transition period, that is, before the socialist society is built, we must always pay close attention to the development of this class struggle situation. Even after the problem of the struggle between the two roads is completely resolved, that is, after socialism is fundamentally built, we still cannot think that the class struggle has ended. As long as imperialism and the bourgeoisie still exist in the world, the activities of counter-revolutionary elements and other anti-socialist elements in our country will not only always be of the nature of class struggle, but will also always echo the reactionaries in the international community. We must have a clear estimate of this situation of class struggle.

Another serious tendency of some comrades in the political and legal organs is to neglect the leadership of the Party. We know that the Party is the core force of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without the leadership of the Party, there would be no dictatorship of the proletariat, and there would be no socialist system. Only by strengthening the leadership of the Party can we ensure that the weapon of dictatorship effectively and accurately strikes the enemy. The leadership of the Party includes not only the leadership of the Party Central Committee, but also the leadership of the local Party committees. That is to say, the political and legal organs of the provinces and municipalities must obey the leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees, and the political and legal organs at the county level must obey the leadership of the county Party committees. This leadership not only does not hinder the correct leadership of the higher-level political and legal organs over the lower-level political and legal organs, but also is a necessary condition for correctly implementing the state's guidelines and policies on political and legal work.

Some comrades have described the Party's leadership over political and legal work as so-called "separation of Party and government" and "separation of Party and law." This criticism is completely wrong. They have forgotten that "the Party is the highest organization of the class, and it must strive to play its correct leading role and core role in all aspects of national life, and oppose any tendency of decentralism that reduces the role of the Party and weakens the unity of the Party." (General Program of the Party Constitution) If the Party's leading role and core role on the political and legal front is the so-called "separation of Party and government" and "separation of Party and law," then the dictatorship of the proletariat needs this "inseparability." The political and legal departments are the key departments of the dictatorship of the proletariat. All major issues in political and legal work must be decided by the Party that leads the dictatorship of the proletariat, because only the Party can understand the entire political situation, understand the entire relationship between the enemy and ourselves, and can weigh the pros and cons from the overall situation, so as to correctly maintain the power of the socialist legal system. If we must refuse this kind of political leadership of the Party, and must "separate" the leadership of the Party from the political and legal organs, then the class nature of such political and legal organs would be very doubtful, wouldn't it? Isn't doing so exactly what the rightists want? Of course, on the other hand, there is still a principled distinction between the work of the Party and the work of state organs. The Party's political leadership over political and legal work must not be understood as the Party's undue interference and substitution for the specific work of political and legal organs.

These bad tendencies in the political and legal departments are mistakes made by some comrades on some issues. We should not exaggerate these mistakes, but we cannot ignore the seriousness of these mistakes. Our task is to thoroughly correct these mistakes, so that our political and legal organs can rely closely on the leadership of the Party, more effectively and accurately strike at the enemy, and constantly consolidate and strengthen our country's people's democratic dictatorship system.

### 克服政法工作中的两种倾向

　　克服政法工作中的两种倾向
    最近从中央到各省市举行了一系列的政法工作会议，着重地批判了政法工作中的两种倾向，即忽视专政的倾向和忽视党的领导的倾向。从这些会议反映的材料来看，问题是严重的。不克服这两种严重的倾向，不但政法战线的反右派斗争无法有力地开展，而且政法战线的革命任务也无法正确地完成。鉴于这两种倾向的广泛程度和严重程度，必须动员全国各级政法工作人员进一步批判这两种倾向，以便把政法工作引上完全正确的道路。
    政法机关对反革命分子、坏分子、坚持反动立场的剥削阶级分子以及一切危害社会主义建设的分子，是实行专政，坚决打击和惩办呢，还是相反，加以纵容和庇护呢？这个本来不应该成为问题的问题，竟然在一段时间里面，在政法部门的一部分同志的头脑当中，弄得相当混乱。这一部分同志竟然忘记了政法机关是人民民主专政的武器。
    在检查政法工作的时候，这种右倾思想明显地表现出来了。他们只注意检查轻罪重判的案件，不注意检查重罪轻判的案件；只注意检查错案，不注意检查漏掉了哪些反革命分子和其他反动分子。在他们的眼睛里，好像只有轻罪重判才是违法的，而放纵敌人、开脱敌人、漏掉敌人却是合法的。
    在执行惩办和宽大相结合的政策上，右倾思想也表现得很明显。在1955年第二次镇反运动以后，在1956年三大改造完成以后，我们的国家是更加巩固了，党和政府认为对反革命分子的政策可以适当地放宽一些。这是完全正确的。有些同志从右的方面理解了这种措施，他们一方面根据这一点来指责1955年的镇反运动，不谈成绩或少谈成绩，多谈错误或专谈错误；另一方面，则严重地放松了当前的对敌斗争。表现在司法工作方面是该判不判，重罪轻判，片面地强调从宽处理，对应该从严处理的案件也从宽处理。在检察工作方面，该捕不捕的现象也很严重。表现在公安工作方面，是放松了管制工作。对被管制分子管得不严，对应该管制的没有实行管制，对不应该撤销管制的撤销了管制。
    政法机关中的一些同志所以产生这种右倾思想，根本原因是对我国的阶级斗争形势认识不清。
    目前我国的阶级斗争形势的特点是什么呢？这就是：不论在城市，不论在乡村，都仍然存在着社会主义和资本主义这样两条道路的斗争。彻底解决这个问题是整个过渡时期的任务。1956年在所有制方面的社会主义革命的基本胜利，并不等于社会主义革命已经完成，尤其不等于阶级斗争已经息灭。在所有制改变以后，资产阶级同无产阶级在政治上和思想上的斗争并没有结束。最近时期资产阶级右派向党向社会主义的猖狂进攻，以及农村中地主富农中的反动分子和其他反革命分子的乘机企图倒算复辟，制造骚乱，说明这种斗争在一定条件下还会达到十分尖锐的程度。因此，在整个过渡时期，即在社会主义社会建成之前，我们都必须时刻严密注意这种阶级斗争形势的发展。即使在两条道路的斗争问题完全解决以后，即社会主义从根本上建成以后，我们仍然不能认为阶级斗争已经息灭。只要世界上还存在着帝国主义和资产阶级，我国的反革命分子和其他反社会主义分子的活动，就不但总是带着阶级斗争的性质，而且总是同国际上的反动派互相呼应的。对于这种阶级斗争的形势，我们必须有清醒的估计。
    政法机关中一部分同志的另一个严重倾向，是忽视党的领导。我们知道，党是无产阶级专政的核心力量，没有党的领导，就没有无产阶级专政，就没有社会主义制度。只有加强党的领导，才能够保证专政的武器有效地和准确地打击敌人。党的领导不但是党中央的领导，也包括了地方党委的领导。就是说，省市的政法机关必须服从省市党委的领导，县级政法机关必须服从县委的领导。这种领导不但不妨碍上级政法机关对于下级政法机关的正确领导，而且是正确地贯彻国家关于政法工作的方针政策的必要条件。
    有些同志把党对政法工作的领导说成是所谓“党政不分”，“党法不分”。这种批评是完全错误的。他们忘记了，“党是阶级的最高组织，它必须努力在国家生活的各个方面发挥它的正确的领导作用和核心作用，反对任何降低党的作用和削弱党的统一的分散主义倾向。”（党章总纲）如果说党在政法战线的领导作用和核心作用就是所谓“党政不分”，“党法不分”，那么，无产阶级专政正需要这种“不分”。政法部门是无产阶级专政的要害部门，凡属政法工作中的重大问题，必须由领导无产阶级专政的党作出决定，因为只有党能够了解整个政治形势，了解整个敌我关系，能够从全局出发权衡利弊，从而正确地维护社会主义法制的威力。假如一定要拒绝党的这种政治领导，一定要把党的领导从政法机关里“分”出去，那末，这种政法机关的阶级性质不就很值得怀疑了么？真的这样作，不正是合了右派分子的心愿么？当然，从另一方面说，党的工作和国家机关的工作还是有原则区别的，党对政法工作的政治领导，决不能理解为党对政法机关的具体工作的不应有的干预和代替。
    政法部门的这些不良倾向，是一部分同志在一部分问题上犯的错误。我们不应该夸大这种错误，但是也不能忽视这些错误的严重性。我们的任务是彻底纠正这些错误，使我们的政法机关紧紧地依靠党的领导，更有效和更准确地打击敌人，不断地巩固和加强我国的人民民主专政制度。
