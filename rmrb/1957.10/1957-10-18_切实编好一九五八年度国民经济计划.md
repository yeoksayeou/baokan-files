　　Conscientiously Compile the 1958 National Economic Plan

    On October 7th, the Anhui Daily published an editorial entitled "Conscientiously Compile Anhui Province's 1958 National Economic Plan."

    The editorial emphasized that in compiling the 1958 plan, all regions and departments must, under the premise of centering on the development of heavy industry, implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture.

    In compiling the agricultural production plan, all regions and units should pay attention to: (1) Solving the problem of the planting ratio of various crops. While ensuring that the task of increasing grain production is not affected, the planting area of ​​cotton and oil crops should be stabilized at the 1957 planned level. The key production areas should not be reduced, and the high-yield areas of cash crops should be appropriately expanded to meet the growing needs of industrial raw materials. (2) We must arrange the production plan for next year's summer harvest now. (3) We must effectively grasp the rational use of agricultural production investment. The basic construction investment in agricultural water conservancy, agricultural loans, agricultural operating expenses, and various production investments of agricultural cooperatives themselves should be considered in combination and arranged well. The focus of use should be on flood control, drainage, irrigation, and the development of fertilizer sources, which are of great importance to agricultural production, and the investment effect should be accurately utilized. (4) Fertilizer production and application is an important key to ensuring the realization of the agricultural production increase plan. In addition to actively developing the fertilizer industry to increase chemical fertilizer production, the solution to the fertilizer problem should still be mainly based on planting green manure and accumulating farm manure. Each agricultural cooperative and each farmer must formulate a fertilizer plan and carry out a manure accumulation campaign in an organized and planned manner. In addition, all localities must, according to the possibility of their strength and with agricultural cooperatives as units, plan to reclaim barren mountains and wastelands, and require the province to complete the task of reclaiming 350,000 mu of wasteland next year to increase the cultivated area. In compiling the 1958 plan, attention should also be paid to strengthening soil and water conservation, animal husbandry, and afforestation in mountainous areas.

    In compiling the industrial production plan, we should seriously study how to balance supply, production, and sales. Local industries should focus on strengthening the production of raw materials and fertilizers. Therefore, investment in this area should be appropriately increased, and some small and medium-sized enterprises should be newly built and expanded to increase production capacity, and efforts should be made to tap the potential of existing equipment and actively increase the production of raw coal, paper, etc. At the same time, all localities should give full play to the enthusiasm of local finances and mass fundraising, and invest in small raw material industries and fertilizer industries in a planned and organized manner according to resources and investment possibilities; they can also encourage handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives (sidelines) to raise funds to carry out small coal mines, small iron mines, small gold mines, and non-metallic mineral product mining to support agricultural production increase and national industrial construction.

    The production of other local industries and handicrafts should generally strive to increase production on the basis of overcoming the difficulty of raw material supply. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen production cooperation between large, medium, and small enterprises, between industry and handicrafts, and between specialized and sideline industries, and to make full use of the production potential of existing industries and handicrafts.

    In the direction of use of basic construction investment, in addition to ensuring the needs of the construction of several key projects and projects that span years, it should mainly be used for small-scale water conservancy projects that directly serve agricultural production and industrial construction of coal, fertilizer, etc., and as many productive constructions with small investment and quick results as possible should be carried out. In compiling the 1958 basic construction plan, it is necessary to strictly implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, and strive to prevent various constructions from deviating from the existing economic level, use domestically manufactured equipment and organize inter-enterprise cooperation as much as possible, and avoid repeated waste in construction. All construction projects included in the plan should be carefully considered, and secondary and unnecessary equipment should be reduced as much as possible, design standards and quotas should be lowered, and construction land should be saved. The investment plan is required to be within the national control figures, and the task of saving 3%-5% of the investment amount should be strictly implemented.

### 切实编好一九五八年度国民经济计划

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

　　切实编好一九五八年度国民经济计划
    10月7日，安徽日报发表了题为“切实编好我省1958年度国民经济计划”的社论。
    社论强调指出：各地区、各部门在编制1958年的计划当中，要在以发展重工业为中心的前提下，贯彻执行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针。
    在编制农业生产计划中，各地区、各单位要注意：（一）解决各种作物的种植比例关系问题。要在保证不影响粮食增产任务的前提下，把棉花和油料作物的种植面积稳定在1957年的计划水平上，重点产区不应有所减少，经济作物的高产地区还要适当扩大种植面积，以适应工业原料增长的需要。（二）目前就要安排好明年午季的生产计划。（三）要切实掌握合理使用农业生产投资。对农业水利的基本建设投资、农业贷款、农业事业费开支和农业社本身的各项生产投资，要结合起来考虑，很好地加以安排。使用重点应放在与农业生产有重大关系的防洪、排涝、灌溉和开辟肥源的事业上，并且要准确地发挥投资效果。（四）造肥施肥是保证农业增产计划实现的重要关键，除积极兴办肥料工业增产化学肥料以外，解决肥料的办法，仍应以种植绿肥、农家积肥为主。各个农业社、每个农户都要订出肥料计划，并有组织、有计划的开展积肥运动。此外，各地还要根据力量的可能，以农业社为单位，有计划地开垦荒山荒地，要求明年全省完成三十五万亩的开荒任务，增加耕地面积。在编制1958年的计划中，并要注意加强山区的水土保持和畜牧、造林事业。
    在编制工业生产计划中，应该认真地研究使供产销达到平衡。地方工业应着重加强原材料和肥料的生产。因此，要适当增加对这方面的投资，新建、扩建一些中小型企业，以增加生产能力，并努力挖掘现有设备潜力，积极增加原煤、纸张等的生产。同时，各地要充分发挥地方财政和群众集资的积极性，根据资源和投资的可能，有计划、有组织地投资举办小型原材料工业和肥料工业；也可以鼓励手工业合作社和农业合作社（副业）筹资进行小煤矿、小铁矿、小金矿和非金属矿产品的开采，以支援农业增产和国家工业建设。
    其他地方工业和手工业生产，一般应在克服原材料供应困难的基础上，尽量争取增产。此外，还必须注意加强中、小企业之间、工业和手工业之间、专业与副业之间的生产协作，充分利用现有工业和手工业的生产潜力。
    在基本建设投资的使用方向上，除保证几个重点工程和拖跨年度工程施工需要外，主要应使用在直接为农业生产服务的小型水利工程和煤炭、肥料等的工业建设上，并尽可能多举办一些投资小、收效快的生产性建设。在编制1958年度基本建设计划中，必须严格执行勤俭建国的方针，务求不使各项建设脱离现有的经济水平，尽量使用国内制造的设备和组织企业间协作，避免建设中的重复浪费现象。凡列入计划的建设项目都应作慎重考虑，尽可能削减次要的和不必要的设备，降低设计标准和定额，并应节约建设用地。要求投资计划在国家控制数字内，严格执行节约投资额3％—5％的节约任务。
