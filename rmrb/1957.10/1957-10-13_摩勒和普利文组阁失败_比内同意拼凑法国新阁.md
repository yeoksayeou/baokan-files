Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 11th: Antoine Pinay, leader of the right-wing Independent Party and former Prime Minister, accepted the invitation of French President Coty on October 11th and agreed to form a new government. In the eleven-day-long French political crisis, Pinay is the third person to attempt to form a cabinet. Prior to him, Mollet of the Socialist Party and Pflimlin of the Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance both failed in their attempts to form a government. Most observers in Paris are equally skeptical about Pinay's chances of successfully forming a cabinet.

Shortly after Pflimlin announced his failure to form a cabinet, Duclos, chairman of the French Communist Party's parliamentary group, was invited to consult with the President again. After the meeting, Duclos pointed out that the Algerian war is the primary issue in French politics, and the solution to this serious problem cannot be separated from the solution to the cabinet crisis.

    摩勒和普利文组阁失败  比内同意拼凑法国新阁
    据新华社巴黎11日电　法国右翼的独立党领袖、前总理安托万·比内10月11日接受法国总统戈蒂的邀请，同意组织新政府。在持续了十一天的法国政治危机中，比内是第三个作组阁尝试的人。在他以前，社会党的摩勒和民主社会抵抗联盟的普利文都在筹组政府的尝试中失败了。巴黎大多数观察家对于比内组阁能否成功同样表示十分怀疑。
    在普利文宣布组阁失败后不久，法国共产党议会党团主席杜克洛应邀再次同总统磋商。杜克洛在会谈后指出，阿尔及利亚战争是法国政治上的首要问题，这个严重问题的解决办法是不能同内阁危机的解决办法分开的。
