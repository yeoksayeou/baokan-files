　　HUBEI, The Xiangyang Special District has achieved agricultural cooperation, comprehensively planned and adapted to local conditions to build farmland water conservancy, and converted dry land into paddy fields. In just two years, it has expanded paddy fields by 740,000 mu and increased guaranteed harvest areas by 1.2 million mu, which has begun to significantly change the low-yield appearance of the entire region.

　　It is estimated that in another five years, that is, by 1962, Xiangyang Special District will basically eliminate ordinary floods and droughts. Paddy fields will be expanded to 6.15 million mu, and guaranteed harvest fields will account for 90% of the total paddy fields. By then, coupled with other production-increasing measures, the grain yield per mu in the region, including dry land, can reach 600 jin, and the total output can be increased from the current 3.7 billion jin to 6 billion jin, basically meeting the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program.

　　Xiangyang Special District is a low-yield grain area in Hubei Province, with more dry land and less paddy fields. Among the 15 million mu of cultivated land in the region, only 3 million mu are paddy fields, accounting for 20% of the cultivated land area. The average yield per mu of dry land is about 200 jin, and the average yield per mu of paddy fields is more than 500 jin. The difference in yield between dry land and paddy fields is significant, and the masses believe that "one irrigation is worth three droughts." Therefore, converting dry land into paddy fields is the fundamental problem in changing the low-yield appearance of grain in Xiangyang Special District.

　　This special district has suitable natural conditions for striving for high yields of crops. There are many rivers, streams, and springs, and water resources are abundant; the climate has both northern and southern characteristics, with a frost-free period of about 200 days, and the average annual rainfall is 800 mm, which is suitable for crop growth; there is a lot of cohesive soil, which does not leak water and is suitable for converting into paddy fields. However, before agricultural cooperation, the progress of converting dry land into paddy fields was very slow. Because, in the past, based on the private small-scale peasant economy, the farmers' forces were scattered, and it was impossible to vigorously build water conservancy. Moreover, due to the obstacles of private land ownership, water conservancy construction could not fully utilize water resources and natural terrain. Therefore, it was impossible to convert a large amount of land into paddy fields in the past. Even the original 3 million mu of paddy fields had 2.2 million mu that could not guarantee harvests.

　　After agricultural cooperation, the peasants gave play to the strength of the collective. Generally, medium-sized and small-scale water conservancy projects can be handled independently by the cooperatives. The construction of water conservancy in the region can be carried out with unified planning, and the labor force can also be uniformly allocated, so that all water resources can be fully utilized. Starting in 1956, in order to establish a water conservancy system and form a water conservancy network in the region, Xiangyang Special District divided the region into six categories: hilly areas, mountainous areas, plain low-lying areas, original paddy field areas, alluvial plain areas, and vegetable garden areas. Comprehensive planning for water conservancy construction was carried out according to local conditions. The counties, districts, townships, and societies first formulated a long-term plan for establishing a water conservancy system based on the terrain; then, according to the plan, they mobilized the masses to gradually build water conservancy in the order of first easy and then difficult. In the construction of water conservancy, we adhere to the principle of focusing on the construction of medium-sized and small-scale water conservancy, which is built, managed, and used by the cooperatives themselves, or built, managed, and used jointly by associated townships and associated cooperatives, with appropriate support from the state. At the same time, we focus on the construction of large-scale water conservancy, so that large-scale projects and small-scale projects cooperate with each other and give full play to their role. In the past two years, Xiangyang Special District has newly built 800 large and small reservoirs and canal projects; renovated 190,000 small weirs, ponds, dikes, and dams, and newly built more than 13,000; dug 1,285 wells; expanded paddy fields by 740,000 mu; and increased guaranteed harvest areas by 1.2 million mu.

　　In the past two years, the low-yield appearance of the region has undergone significant changes. The appearance of some townships has changed greatly, and a few townships have fundamentally changed their low-yield situation. Maochao Township in Yicheng County had no paddy fields in the past, but after cooperation, it opened up 10,000 mu of paddy fields. Changhu Society in this township had no paddy fields in the past. In the two years after cooperation, 2,075 mu of the society's 3,000 mu of cultivated land have been converted into paddy fields. Now, this society has changed from a grain-deficient society to a surplus-grain society. In 1954, the state supplied 180,000 jin of grain, and in 1957, it sold 600,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The conversion of dry land into paddy fields and the great increase in production have further strengthened the confidence of the members of the society in the cooperative system. They believe that "the cooperative has taken root," and "the cooperative can no longer be blown away by a small wind or dispersed by a big wind." The well-to-do middle peasants initially did not believe in the measures to convert dry land into paddy fields. Some people said, "One side of the water and soil raises one side of people. If you are born with a sweet potato-eating mouth, how can you eat rice?" Now they have also admitted defeat. They sincerely said: "What could not be done for thousands of years has been done by the Communist Party. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao really have a way."

　　Now, Xiangyang Special District has the full conditions for converting large areas of dry land into paddy fields. These conditions are: the consolidation of the foundation of cooperation, the accumulation of experience in building water conservancy, the training of 40,000 rural water conservancy technicians, the formulation of comprehensive plans for building water conservancy in various townships, and the initial formation of the water conservancy system in some townships. In particular, the fact that production has increased after converting dry land into paddy fields has encouraged the masses to expand paddy fields. It is estimated that this winter and next spring, there will be a high tide of water conservancy construction in the region.

### 湖北襄阳专区低产面貌显著改变  建设水利网改旱地为水田  五年后基本消灭普通水旱灾害，粮食产量可增加一倍

    湖北襄阳专区低产面貌显著改变
    建设水利网改旱地为水田
    五年后基本消灭普通水旱灾害，粮食产量可增加一倍
    本报讯　湖北省襄阳专区实现农业合作化以后，全面规划、因地制宜地兴修农田水利，改旱地为水田，短短两年中扩大水田七十四万亩，增加保收面积一百二十万亩，开始显著地改变了全区低产的面貌。
    预计再过五年，即到1962年，襄阳专区将基本上消灭普通的水灾和旱灾，水田将扩大到六百一十五万亩，保收田将占水田总数的90％。那时，再加上其他的增产措施，全区包括旱地在内的粮食单位面积产量可以达到六百斤，总产量可以由现在的三十七亿斤增加到六十亿斤，基本上达到全国农业发展纲要的要求。
    襄阳专区是湖北省的粮食低产地区，旱地多，水田少。在全区一千五百万亩耕地中，水田只有三百万亩，占耕地面积的20％。旱地平均每亩产量为二百斤左右，水田平均每亩产量在五百斤以上。旱地和水田的产量相差悬殊，群众都认为“一水能顶三旱”。因此，把旱地改为水田是改变襄阳专区粮食低产面貌的根本问题。
    这个专区具有争取农作物高产的适宜的自然条件。河多、溪多、泉多，水利资源丰富；气候兼有南北方的特点，无霜期两百天左右，每年雨量平均为八百公厘，适应农作物的生长；粘性土多，不漏水，适合改水田。但是，在农业合作化以前，旱地改水田的进度十分缓慢。因为，过去在私有的个体小农经济基础上，农民力量分散，不可能大力兴修水利，而且由于土地私有的障碍，修水利不能充分利用水利资源和自然地形。因此，过去不可能大量改为水田，就是原有的三百万亩水田，也有二百二十万亩不能保收。
    农业合作化以后，农民发挥了集体力量，一般的中、小型水利，都可能由合作社自力举办。全区兴修水利可以实行统一规划，劳动力也可以实行统一调配，一切水利资源都能充分利用起来。从1956年开始，为了在全区建立一个水利系统，构成一个水利网，襄阳专区把全区分成丘陵岗地、山区、平原低洼地、原有水田地区、冲积平原地区和菜园地区等六类地区，因地制宜地进行兴修水利的全面规划。各县、区、乡、社首先制订了根据地形建立水利系统的远景规划；然后，根据规划发动群众按先易后难的顺序逐步兴修。在兴修水利中，坚持以兴修中、小型水利为主，由合作社自修、自管、自用，或者联乡联社伙修、伙管、伙用，国家适当给以扶植的方针。同时重点建设大型水利，使大型工程和小型工程互相配合，充分发挥作用。两年中，襄阳专区共新修大小水库渠道工程八百处；整修小型堰、塘、壋、坝十九万处，新修一万三千多处；打井一千二百八十五眼；扩大水田七十四万亩；增加保收面积一百二十万亩。
    两年来，全区低产面貌发生显著变化，一部分乡的面貌已经大变，少数乡根本改变了低产的情况。宜城县茅草乡过去没有水田，合作化后开辟水田一万亩。这个乡的长湖社，过去没有水田，合作化后两年中，全社三千亩耕地，已有二千零七十五亩改成了水田。现在，这个社已经由缺粮社变为余粮社，1954年由国家供应十八万斤粮食，1957年就卖给国家余粮六十万斤。旱地改水田，生产大增长，更加坚定了社员群众对合作化制度的信心。他们认为，“合作社生了根了”，
  “合作社现在是小风吹不动、大风吹不散了”。富裕中农最初对旱地改水田的措施不大相信。有人说，“一方水土养一方人，生就了吃红薯的嘴，想吃大米咋能行呢？”现在也认输了。他们心悦诚服地说：“几千年没有办到的事情，共产党办到了，共产党和毛主席真有办法。”
    现在，襄阳专区已经具备了把大面积旱地改为水田的充分条件。这些条件是：合作化基础的巩固，兴修水利经验的积累，新培养了四万名农村水利技术人员，各乡制订了兴修水利的全面规划，有些乡的水利系统的雏形已经形成。特别是旱地改水田后增产的事实，鼓舞了群众扩大水田的积极性。预计今冬明春，全区将要出现一个兴修水利的高潮。
