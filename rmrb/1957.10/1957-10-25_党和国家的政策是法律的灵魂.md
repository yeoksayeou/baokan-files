    The Party and State's Policies are the Soul of the Law

    Right-wing elements deeply hate the Communist Party and the People's Government for using policies to guide legal work, and they attack us for "replacing the law with policies." Originally, in socialist countries, the policies of the Communist Party and the state are the soul of the law. Various legal norms are simply the legislative formalization of effective policies, making them systematic, codified, and specific, becoming behavioral norms for people's work and life. In our country, countless facts have proven that the Communist Party's policies correctly and centrally reflect the laws of social development and the interests of the people, possessing unparalleled power and deeply winning the support of the masses. Therefore, the people's democratic legal system reflects the Communist Party's policies, which is a fundamental aspect of embodying the Communist Party's leadership in law. It is an important guarantee that our country's legal system conforms to the people's will and interests, and it is also a concrete manifestation of the law serving politics.

### 党和国家的政策是法律的灵魂

    党和国家的政策是法律的灵魂
    右派分子十分仇视共产党和人民政府以政策指导法制工作，他们攻击我们是“以政策代替法律”。本来，在社会主义国家里，共产党和国家的政策就是法律的灵魂，各种法律规范不过是把行之有效的政策用立法的形式固定下来，并使之系统化、条文化和具体化，成为人们工作与生活的行为规范。在我们国家里，无数事实证明，共产党的政策正确、集中地反映了社会发展规律和人民利益，具有无比的威力，深得人民群众的拥护。所以人民民主法制反映了共产党的政策，这正是在法律上体现共产党领导的一个根本方面，是我国法制符合人民意志和利益的重要保证，也是法律为政治服务的具体表现。（摘自1957年“政法研究”第五期：“捍卫人民民主法制，彻底粉碎右派分子的猖狂进攻”）
