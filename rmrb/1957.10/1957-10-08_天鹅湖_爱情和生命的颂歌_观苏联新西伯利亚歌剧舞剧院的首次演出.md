    Swan Lake—A Song of Praise to Love and Life
    ——Watching the Premiere Performance of the Soviet Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater

    When the music of the final act of "Swan Lake" abruptly shifts from the powerful, conflicting sound themes to a bright and radiant realm, when Odette and Siegfried's steadfast love finally defeats the evil sorcerer, liberating all the swans held under his curse, this radiant purity of love that has triumphed over death brings immense encouragement and warmth to the audience. "Swan Lake" is a heroic ode to the resistance against violence, a solemn poem praising the spirit of self-sacrifice in the struggle for happiness.
    With the haunting theme of the swans' fate in Tchaikovsky's music, the ballet immediately draws the audience into sympathy for Odette. The choreographers and performers, in response to the demands of the drama, offer a visual interpretation of the overture—adding a prologue to the traditional performance script to depict the innocence of this maiden, providing a clear background for the development of the entire play. Thanks to the prologue, the image of the pure Odette, the evil sorcerer Rothbart as the opposing force of good, that hateful demonic castle and jagged rocks, and that mysterious lake, all begin to enter the audience's realm of thought. This, in turn, forms a sense of anticipation in the audience for the character and behavior of Prince Siegfried who appears in the first act, remotely echoing the prince's entire psychological behavior and the tragic fate of Odette that has already occurred. Thus, a main thread of the plot running through the entire play is formed, the characters' stage behavior becomes reasonable, and the contradictions and conflicts unfold sharply from the very beginning. This overcomes the shortcomings of past Swan Lake performances, where the amusement and dance scenes on the Prince's name day in the first act were too lengthy, and the development of the drama was too slow. The prologue prepares for the occurrence of events and the characterization of the characters in the first act.
    Following the demands of the drama, the choreographers and performers rearranged the dance scenes and staging of the first act on the basis of the traditional performance. Whether it is the first grand waltz, or the polonaise dance at the end of the amusement, or the trio dance, or the several variations in between, all are interwoven with the aim of depicting the banquet life of the Prince's name day in the forest. Through the dazzling pas de deux scenes danced one by one by the Prince and his girlfriends, especially in that slow variation dance in which Siegfried plays the six-stringed harp, a true and concrete depiction is made of the character of this prince who is deep in his heart, often pensive, and full of rich fantasies.
    All the unfolding of the drama is in the second act; on the mysterious lakeside, the swans transform into maidens, Siegfried and Odette meet, and after telling their stories and feeling sympathy for each other, they reach a vow of love. But to rescue Odette from the sorcerer's curse, love still needs to undergo the test of unwavering loyalty. This act is an outstanding scene in the entire play of Swan Lake. The entire dance score of this act elevates the love between Odette and Siegfried to such a high level of poetic realm, interweaving all the emotions of sadness, hope, and encouragement of love, declaring resistance against the persecution of the demon Rothbart with an image of pure and sublime love. This is a model of dance creation, with the entire image unified in a transparent, pure, and soft tone, using precise, harmonious, and perfect picture lines and movement combinations to embody the inner spiritual image of the music, and conducting a completely symphonic conception and construction in the dance.
    At the end of this act, the unsettling and sorrowful swan theme appears again. Odette and Siegfried reluctantly bid farewell, leaving the thread of love waiting for the test in the exhortation to be faithful to the oath.
    The development of the plot presents a difficult task for the third act. How should we interpret everything that happens to Siegfried in the third act? Is he a fickle person who is unfaithful and abandons his oath? Obviously, this is not the case. If the performance mistakenly leads the audience to such a feeling, it would damage the theme of Swan Lake and damage the perfect characters and images of Odette and Siegfried. The directors and performers of Swan Lake correctly grasped the dramatic task in this act, and through dance images and various detailed performances, they tried their best to explain that the Prince, due to the tricks and bewitchment of the demon and his daughter Odile, could not escape from his own transformation from doubt to conviction, mistakenly recognizing Odile as Odette, and tragically choosing her as his fiancée, thus breaking his oath with Odette. This is a mistake that is difficult to forgive, but it is unintentional, and is due to being tricked and persecuted. Because this point is clearly and clearly explained, the integrity of Siegfried's character is maintained, and the drama of the third act reaches a sharp degree. Here, the poetry of dance is closely combined with the requirements of the drama. This act, starting from the fiery and hot Spanish dance of the people who accompanied Rothbart, began an ominous omen. Then, the fickle Odile appeared continuously in various character dances, confusing the Prince. This tension-filled drama, which runs through the group dance of character dances, follows one step after another, until Odile's continuous rotations in the final part of the pas de deux reach a climax, showing her mad cry after succeeding in destroying the love between the Prince and Odette.
    The dramatic conflict has now reached its peak, and the task left is to wait for the fourth act to resolve it. The location returns to the lakeside, and the characters are still Odette, the Prince, the swans, and the demon, but the emotions required here are far from being a repetition of everything in the second act.
    Composer Tchaikovsky's music itself has already described all the emotions of this act with the great image power of the symphony. Therefore, the requirement for the design of dance images is how to correctly understand the composer's conception and intention, how to accurately embody and interpret every detail of the music, and perfectly transform the auditory image of the music into the visual image of the dance.
    The dance begins by unfolding the swan group dance scene that is unified with the Russian girl's round dance theme used in the music. Many round dance forms in the dance design are in coordination with the image of the swans, expressing the anxiety of the girls for the love between Odette and the Prince in a melancholic emotion. Then, Odette returns to the swan group in grief and disappointment. This is her long, painful, and weeping solo dance, accompanied by the common sorrow of the swans. Rothbart, in order to prevent the Prince from finding Odette, brought about a storm scene of the symphony; when the Prince came to the lake, an extremely brilliant musical passage appeared at this time, but this was only a moment of hope and light, because the Prince had already made a big mistake, and the swans' hope of being saved had been shattered; at this time, the swans formed a long line of double rows, accompanying Odette away from the Prince with a slow andante from the diagonal of the stage. The entire stage image and conception describe an emotion of helpless grief. Only Odette stepped out of the line several times to look back at the Prince, and then the flame of her undying love for Siegfried burst out. When the music expressed Odette's last faint hope in the low cry of the clarinet, then the theme varied on the flute, expressing her inner, lingering sympathy for Siegfried, and then love led to a great fighting will. That swan theme that ran through the entire play appeared again, Odette bravely threw herself into the Prince's arms, symbolizing a bold emotion yearning for freedom. This theme gradually expanded in the orchestra and became a powerful sound intertwined and conflicted, and then the demon appeared, forming a strong struggle between the two forces of good and evil in the unison of the orchestra. Finally, in Odette and the Prince's steadfast kiss, the demon's sorcery was completely shattered, and the imprisoned swans all turned back into beautiful maidens. In the entire fourth act, all these dance images closely followed the development of Tchaikovsky's immortal music, deeply embodying the climax required by the theme, and resolving the dramatic conflict.
    All the exemplary traditions in the performance of Swan Lake, and the innovative creations of the choreographer, the Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet, Satunovsky, are embodied through the genius actors. Zhimina, the People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federation, shaped the images of Odette and Odile. In the two completely different character personalities, she vividly and movingly portrayed the tragic purity and the dignified maiden incarnation—the white swan, and the treacherous, cunning, and vicious hybrid—the black swan. In the exemplary pas de deux in the second and third acts, she showed extremely high skills. Yang Song was also very successful in embodying the character of the Prince. The actor's high jumping ability, leg kicks, aerial rotations, and accurate and stable ability simply surprised the audience. Lehhlov's portrayal of the demon was also distinct and powerful. He had a solo dance in the third act, which well vented the ferocity of this character's successful evildoing. The high integrity of this performance was also achieved through the true performance and cooperation of all the other actors in the play.
    From just the entire image displayed by this repertoire of the premiere, people are deeply impressed by the great achievements of this "contemporary of the victory of the Patriotic War"—the young theater. They have an innovative and creative spirit in ballet art. This innovation is not just making detailed deletions and cuts to traditional repertoires in art, but is carried out with a complete creative idea—adhering to the creative method of socialist realism; just as it is embodied in Swan Lake, on the one hand, faithfully inheriting the legacy of the masters of the past (music, dance), and on the other hand, constantly seeking to develop the truthfulness and popular nature of dramatic expression. They also created Soviet modern-themed ballet works such as "The Shore of Happiness" with this spirit.
    We believe that the other ballet repertoires of the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater will be loved and praised by the audience in the capital. Let us wish them success!

    天鹅湖——爱情和生命的颂歌
    ——观苏联新西伯利亚歌剧舞剧院的首次演出
    游惠海
    当“天鹅湖”第四幕终场的音乐由强大的冲突的音响主题骤然转入明朗光辉的意境，当奥杰塔和齐格弗里德的坚贞的爱情终于击倒恶魔，解放了所有被禁咒的天鹅的时候，这种战胜了死亡的纯洁、不屈的爱情光辉，带给了观众极大的鼓舞和温暖。“天鹅湖”，这是一首反抗暴力的英雄颂歌，是一首赞美以自我牺牲的精神为幸福而斗争的庄严诗篇。
    随着柴可夫斯基音乐中扣人心弦的天鹅命运的主题，舞剧一开始就把观众吸引到对奥杰塔的同情上去了。编导演出者在戏剧任务的要求下对序曲作了一种视觉形象上的解释——在传统的演出剧本基础上加上了一个序幕来表现这个少女的无辜，为整个剧的发展提供了清晰的背景。由于有了序幕，纯洁的奥杰塔的形象，作为善良的敌对力量的罗特巴尔特恶魔，那个可憎的恶魔城堡与断岩，那一片神秘的湖水，都开始进入观众的思想境界了。继而形成了观众对第一幕出现的王子齐格弗里德的性格和行为的一种期待的心情，把王子的全部心理行为和已经发生的奥杰塔的悲惨命运遥遥地呼应起来，于是一条贯穿全剧的情节主线形成了，人物的舞台行为合理了，矛盾和冲突一开始就急剧地展开了。这样就克服了过去天鹅湖演出时第一幕王子命名日嬉游舞蹈场面过于冗长，戏剧情节发展过于迟缓的缺点，序幕为第一幕的事件的产生，人物的刻划作好了准备。
    编导演出者遵循着戏剧的要求，在传统的演出基础上重新安排了第一幕的舞蹈场面和调度，无论是第一曲大华尔滋舞，或游乐结束时的波伦涅茨舞或者三人舞和中间的几段变奏舞，都贯穿了要表现王子命名日在丛林中的游宴生活。通过王子和女友们逐一地跳华丽的双人舞场面，尤其是在那一段齐格弗里德弹着六弦琴的缓慢变奏舞中对这一位内心深沉经常若有所思，具有丰富的幻想的王子的性格，作了真实具体的描写。
    戏剧性的一切开展是在第二幕；在神秘的湖畔，天鹅变成了少女，齐格弗里德和奥杰塔会见了，经过诉说、同情而达到相爱的盟誓，但是要把奥杰塔从恶魔的咒术中解救出来，爱情还需要经过忠贞不渝的考验。这一幕是天鹅湖全剧的杰出场面。这一幕的全部舞蹈总谱把奥杰塔和齐格弗里德的爱情提升到这样的一种高度的诗境，交织了伤感、希望、爱情的鼓励的全部感情，以爱情纯真崇高的形象，宣告了对罗特巴尔特恶魔迫害的反抗。这是一幕典范的舞蹈创作，全部形象统一在一种透明的、纯洁柔和的调子里，用了精确、和谐、完美的画面线条和动作组合，来体现音乐的内在精神形象，在舞蹈上进行了完全交响化的构思和建筑。
    在这一幕的结束，音乐又出现那个不安的悲怆的天鹅主题，奥杰塔和齐格弗里德依依不舍，在忠实于誓言的叮咛中告别，留下了爱情等待着考验的伏线。
    戏剧情节的开展给第三幕提出了一个艰巨的任务。如何来解析齐格弗里德在第三幕中发生的一切呢？难道他是一个三心二意、见异思迁而背弃誓言的人吗？显然不是如此，如果演出错误地使观众得出这种感觉，那就是损害了天鹅湖的主题，损害了奥杰塔和齐格弗里德完美的性格和形象的。天鹅湖的导演演出者在这一幕中正确地掌握了戏剧任务，通过舞蹈形象和各种细节表演极力说明了王子由于恶魔及其女儿奥吉丽雅的作弄蛊惑，无法摆脱自己由怀疑到确信，误认奥吉丽雅就是奥杰塔，而悲剧地把她选作未婚妻而破坏了和奥杰塔的誓约，这是很难宽恕的错误，但又是无意的，被作弄迫害的，由于正确清楚地阐明了这一点，就保持了齐格弗里德性格的完整，并使第三幕的戏剧性达到了尖锐的程度。在这里，舞蹈的诗情与戏剧的要求密切结合起来了。这一幕从随同罗特巴尔特来的人们的火红热辣的西班牙舞就开始了一种不祥的预兆，接下去善变的奥吉丽雅连续在各个性格舞中出现，迷惑着王子。这种贯穿在性格舞组舞中的紧张的戏剧性，一步紧跟一步地，直到双人舞时奥吉丽雅在尾段中的连续旋转，显示了她破坏王子与奥杰塔的爱情得逞后的疯狂叫嚣而达到高峰。
    戏剧冲突现在已经到达顶点了，留下的任务是等待第四幕来解决了，地点又回到湖畔，人物还是奥杰塔、王子、众天鹅、恶魔，可是这里所要求的感情远不能是去重复第二幕的一切了。
    作曲家柴可夫斯基的音乐本身已经以交响乐的巨大的形象力量描写了这一幕的全部感情，因此对舞蹈形象设计的要求就是如何正确地理解作曲家的构思和意图，如何准确地体现和解释音乐的每一个细节，完美地把音乐的听觉形象转化为舞蹈的视觉形象。
    舞蹈开始展现的是和音乐所运用的俄罗斯少女轮舞主题相统一的天鹅群舞场面，舞蹈设计上许多轮舞的形式构图配合了天鹅的形象，表现少女们在一种忧郁的感情中对奥杰塔和王子爱情的不安。接着奥杰塔在悲痛的失望中回到天鹅群中来，这是她的一长段悲痛的、哭泣的独舞，伴以天鹅们共同的悲伤。罗特巴尔特为阻止王子寻找奥杰塔引来了交响乐的风暴画面；当王子来到湖边，这时出现了极为灿烂的乐段，但是这只是一瞬间的希望和光明，因为王子已经铸成大错了，天鹅们得救的希望已经破灭了；这时天鹅们组成双行的长列，从舞台的对角线以缓慢的行板陪同奥杰塔离开王子，整个舞台形象与构思描写了无可奈何的沉痛的感情。只有奥杰塔几次步出行列回顾王子，这才迸发了她对齐格弗里德没有熄灭的爱情火焰。当音乐在黑管像低沉的哭泣中表达奥杰塔最后的微弱的希望时，紧接着主题在长笛上变奏出了她的内心缠绵不断的对齐格弗里德的同情，于是爱情引来了巨大的斗争意志，那一个贯穿全剧的天鹅主题又出现了，奥杰塔勇敢地投入王子的怀抱，象征着向往自由的果敢情绪。这一主题逐渐在乐队中扩大变成强大的音响交织和冲突起来，于是恶魔出现了，在乐队的齐奏中形成了善恶二种力量的强烈的搏斗，最后在奥杰塔与王子坚贞的一吻中恶魔的妖术彻底粉碎了，被禁锢的天鹅们都变回了美丽的少女。在整个第四幕中这一切舞蹈的形象就是这样紧密地跟随着柴可夫斯基不朽的音乐的发展，深刻地体现了主题所要求的高潮，解决了戏剧的冲突。
    天鹅湖演出中的一切典范的传统，编导演出者俄罗斯苏维埃功勋演员萨图诺夫斯基的革新创造都通过天才的演员们来体现。俄罗斯苏维埃联邦人民演员齐米娜塑造了奥杰塔和奥吉丽雅的形象，在二个截然不同的人物性格中，她把悲怆的纯洁和庄严的少女化身——白天鹅，把阴险狡猾恶毒的混合体——黑天鹅都刻划得那样鲜明动人，在第二、三幕典范的双人舞中她表现了极高的技巧。杨松在体现王子的性格上也是很成功的，这位演员的高度弹跳腿部打击空中旋转，准确稳定的能力，简直使观众惊奇。雷赫洛夫塑造的恶魔也是鲜明有力的，第三幕中他有一段独舞，很好地宣泄了这个人物恶行得逞的凶焰。这次演出的高度完整也正是靠了全剧其他所有的演员的真实表演和合作所达到的。
    仅从首次演出的这个剧目所展示出来的全部形象，就使人深深感到这个“卫国战争胜利的同年人”——年青剧院的巨大成就，他们在芭蕾艺术上具有革新创造的精神，这种革新并不是在艺术上对传统剧目只作细节的删改和剪裁，而是以一种完整的创作思想——坚持社会主义现实主义的创作方法来进行的；正如体现在天鹅湖中的一面忠实继承先辈大师的遗产（音乐、舞蹈），另一面是不断地寻求发展戏剧表现上的真实性和人民性。他们并以这种精神创作了像“幸福之岸”的苏维埃现代题材舞剧作品。
    我们相信新西伯利亚歌剧舞剧院的其他几个舞剧剧目都将获得首都观众的热爱和赞许，让我们祝他们成功！
