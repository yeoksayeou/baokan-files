Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 20th: Czechoslovakia's nationwide Peace and Friendship Relay Race, held to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, began in Prague on the 19th.

	The relay race will deliver a letter from the Czechoslovak people to the Soviet people at the Czechoslovak-Soviet border on November 4th.

	At 6:00 PM on October 19th, seven hundred delegates participating in the opening of the national congress of the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Association, together with representatives from all walks of life in Prague, held a congress in the Lucerna Hall and adopted a letter from the Czechoslovak people to the Soviet people congratulating them on the 40th anniversary of the great October Revolution.

	The letter was placed in two steel cylinders and handed over to young long-distance runners. Then, amidst cheers, seventy or eighty male and female long-distance runners, holding torches high, ran out of the Lucerna Hall and began the peace and friendship relay race celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

	Every time the relay race reaches a county, a beautiful brocade banner is placed on a truck. In this way, the sentiments of the Czechoslovak people towards the October Revolution and the first socialist country are gathered together and, following the footsteps of the long-distance runners, sent to the Soviet Union, to Moscow, to the Red Square where the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution commemoration will be held.

    把衷心的祝贺送到莫斯科红场
    捷和平友谊接力赛跑开始
    据新华社布拉格20日电　捷克斯洛伐克为庆祝十月革命四十周年所举行的全国和平友谊接力赛跑，19日在布拉格开始。
    这次接力赛跑将在11月4日把捷克斯洛伐克人民给苏联人民的一封信在捷苏边境交给苏联人民。
    10月19日晚六时，参加当天开幕的捷苏友好协会全国代表大会的七百个代表同布拉格各界人民的代表一起，在路采尔纳大厅举行了大会，通过了捷人民致苏人民祝贺伟大十月革命四十周年的信。
    信件被装在两个钢筒里，交给了青年长跑运动员。接着，七八十个男女长跑运动员在一片欢呼声中，高举着火把从路采尔纳大厅跑了出来，开始了庆祝十月革命四十周年的和平友谊接力长跑。
    接力赛跑每到一个县，就有一面美丽的锦旗插到卡车上去。捷克斯洛伐克人民对十月革命、对第一个社会主义国家的心意就是这样汇集起来，随着长跑运动员的脚步，送到苏联，送到莫斯科，送到那将举行十月革命四十周年纪念大会的红场上去。
