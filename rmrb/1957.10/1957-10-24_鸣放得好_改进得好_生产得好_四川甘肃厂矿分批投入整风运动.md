Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th: From mid-September to now, more than 200,000 workers in thirteen cities and regions in Sichuan Province, including Chongqing, Chengdu, Zigong, Yibin, and Leshan, have entered the Rectification and Socialist Education Movement in batches.

The upsurge of airing views among the vast number of workers in Chongqing, Zigong, Xichang and other places is gradually rising. The 100,000 workers of the first batch of twenty-one large factories and mines in Chongqing, which are at the height of airing views, have put forward 240,000 opinions and posted more than 70,000 big-character posters since late September. The first and second batches of factory and mine workers in Chengdu, where the movement started the earliest, have already expressed more than 130,000 opinions, averaging more than three per person. The workers in five units in Yibin also put forward an average of more than three opinions each.

Before the Rectification Campaign, the leadership of enterprises in various places repeatedly mobilized the workers and adopted various methods to encourage them to air their views. The leadership of Chongqing Jialing Machine Factory collected workers' opinions through six methods, such as discussion meetings, special airing-of-views meetings, and individual visits, so that more than 90% of the workers in the factory expressed their opinions. Chengdu Lumber Mill and other units also specially held forums for veteran workers to have detailed discussions and solicit their opinions.

During the airing of views, many moving examples of opinions being raised in the morning and corrected in the afternoon, and opinions being raised one day and corrected the next day appeared in various places. Many good news stories of long-unresolved problems being solved also came. There was no telephone on the working face of the tunnel in the Zhangshan Mining Area of Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Factory, making it very inconvenient for the jackhammer workers to contact the air compressor room. After the workers criticized this, a telephone was quickly installed. The problems of changing rubber rollers for small paper machines and improving the pressing capacity of machine tools in Yibin 602 Paper Mill, which no one had been responsible for handling in the past, were also quickly resolved this time. Enterprises in Chengdu mobilized the masses to work together, and in ten days they handled more than 13,000 opinions raised by workers, accounting for more than one-fifth of the total number of workers' opinions after sorting. At present, most units in this city have entered the stage of focusing on rectifying work style and improving work.

"Good airing of views, good production" and "Production and rectification are not delayed" have become the common language of the vast number of workers. In many enterprises, workers' production success reports, guarantee letters, and big-character posters are intertwined. After the start of the Rectification Campaign, Yibin 602 Paper Mill continuously created the highest records since the establishment of the factory, such as a monthly paper production of 1,048 tons and a qualification rate of 94.8%.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 21st: The airing of views by more than 110,000 workers in the first batch of 200 factories and mines in Gansu Province is vigorously unfolding, and some key units have already begun to enter the stage of great debate.

This batch of units for airing views started successively from late September. After relatively full preparation and mobilization in each unit, the workers actively participated in the movement without any worries. By October 15th, the workers had put forward more than 80,000 opinions in big-character posters.

In these factories and mines, many opinions raised by the workers were handled in a timely manner due to the implementation of the principle of rectifying while correcting. Workers of the 641 Team of the Gansu Provincial Bureau of Geology pointed out that there was a serious problem of overstaffing in the team. Each drilling rig was equipped with a full-time machine leader, but the machine leader only went to see the drilling rig once a day, and only for one hour at a time. Therefore, they suggested that two drilling rigs should be equipped with one machine leader. The Communist Party organization of the 641 Team believed that this opinion was correct. After research, it has been decided to change the machine leader system to a team system, with one team leader responsible for three or four drilling rigs, which can reduce the number of machine leaders by a large margin.

In the airing of views, the enthusiasm for production among the workers of each unit has become even higher. After the start of the airing of views by workers of Yumen Oil Mine, the production of gasoline increased by 45 tons in nine days.

### 鸣放得好　改进得好　生产得好  四川甘肃厂矿分批投入整风运动

    鸣放得好　改进得好　生产得好
    四川甘肃厂矿分批投入整风运动
    新华社成都19日电　从9月中旬到现在，四川省已经有重庆、成都、自贡、宜宾、乐山等十三个城市和地区的二十多万职工，分批投入整风和社会主义教育运动。
    重庆、自贡、西昌等地的广大职工的鸣放热潮正在逐步高涨。处在鸣放高潮的重庆第一批二十一个大型厂矿的十万工人群众，从9月下旬以来已提出二十四万条意见，贴出七万多张大字报；运动开展最早的成都第一批和第二批厂矿职工，已发表了十三万多条意见，平均每人三条多；宜宾五个单位的职工平均每人也提出了三条多意见。
    各地企业领导方面未整风之前都反复进行了动员，并采取各种方式鼓励职工鸣放。重庆嘉陵机器厂领导方面通过座谈会、专题鸣放会、个别访问等六种方式征集职工意见，使厂内90％以上的工人都发表了意见。成都制材厂等单位还专门召开老工人座谈会，细细地谈，征求他们的意见。
    大鸣大放中，各地都出现了许多上午提意见下午就改、头天提出意见第二天就改等动人的事例，也传来了许多长期未解决的问题得到解决的喜讯。乐山磷肥厂张山采矿场坑道工作面没有电话，风钻工和压风房联系很不方便。这次工人提出批评以后，很快就装上了电话。宜宾六零二造纸厂小纸车换胶辊和改进车床压榨能力的问题，过去无人负责处理，这次也很快得到解决。成都市各企业发动群众一齐动手，十天中就处理了职工提出的一万三千多条意见，占整理后职工意见总数的五分之一多。现在这个城市的多数单位已进入以整顿作风、改进工作为主的阶段。
      “鸣放好、生产好”、“生产、整风两不误”，已成为广大职工的共同语言。许多企业里，职工们的生产捷报、保证书和大字报交相辉映。宜宾六零二造纸厂整风开始以后，连续创造了月产纸一千零四十八吨、合格率达94.8％等建厂以来最高纪录。
    据新华社兰州21日电　甘肃省第一批二百个厂矿企业的十一万多名职工的大鸣大放，正在蓬勃展开，有些重点单位已经开始进入大辩论阶段。
    这一批大鸣大放的单位是从9月下旬陆续开始的。各单位经过比较充分的准备和动员后，职工们都无顾虑地积极参加了运动。到10月15日，职工们已用大字报提出了八万多条意见。
    这些厂矿企业在鸣放中由于贯彻了边整边改方针，职工提出的不少意见都及时得到了处理。甘肃省地质局六四一队工人提出队里人浮于事现象严重，一台钻机设一个脱产机长，而机长每天只到钻机上看一次，一次不过一小时。因此他们建议两台钻机设一个机长。六四一队中共组织认为这个意见是正确的，经过研究已经决定把机长制改为小队制，一个小队长负责三、四台钻机，这样可减少一大半机长。
    各单位职工在大鸣大放中，生产热情更加高涨。玉门油矿职工鸣放开始后，九天中就增产汽油四十五吨。
