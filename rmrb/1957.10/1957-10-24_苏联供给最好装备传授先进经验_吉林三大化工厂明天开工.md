    The Soviet Union Supplies Best Equipment and Passes on Advanced Experience
    Three Major Chemical Plants in Jilin to Start Operation Tomorrow

    (Our newspaper, Jilin, 23rd) The three major chemical plants in Jilin – Jilin Fertilizer Plant, Jilin Dyestuff Plant, and Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant – are scheduled to officially start production on October 25th. The acceptance and handover signing ceremony was held on the 23rd. The State Acceptance Committee believes that the quality of all construction projects of these three chemical plants has met the design requirements.
    Currently, the Jilin Fertilizer Plant has been fully put into production, and the quality of the products produced is very good; among them, ammonium nitrate (chemical fertilizer) has begun to be supplied to rural areas. The Jilin Dyestuff Plant, which was originally planned to be completed next year, has already completed six workshops ahead of schedule and trial-produced the first batch of An'an Blue dyes and dye intermediates. The Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant has also been basically completed and is producing a large amount of calcium carbide for other industrial sectors. Now, the employees of these three plants are actively preparing to welcome the opening ceremony.
    The factory building projects of the three major chemical plants in Jilin all started in early 1955. They were originally planned to be put into production next year, but now they have completed the plant construction and trial production tasks several months ahead of schedule. All the employees of the three major chemical plants, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee to vigorously develop the chemical industry and support agricultural production, tried every possible means to speed up construction and shorten the construction period, and completed the vast architectural and installation engineering tasks in less than three years. In the civil engineering construction of the factory buildings alone, the workers excavated more than 3 million cubic meters of earth and built more than 200 million bricks. The three plants produce a variety of products, with complex technologies, and the production process is ever-changing, making equipment installation more difficult. There are hundreds of kilometers of various complicated pipelines. They overlap and interlace each other, parallel and symmetrical, with thousands of strands. Installing them requires not only good technology but also close cooperation. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, the construction workers successfully completed these tasks. Due to the good quality of the construction and installation projects of the three plants, the test runs were also very smooth, and the quality of the first batch of products produced during the trial production reached the design requirements.
    The three major chemical plants in Jilin are all key projects during my country's first five-year plan. Their early commissioning will enable my country's weak chemical industry to take a big step forward. Products such as calcium carbide, synthetic ammonia, ammonium nitrate, and An'an Blue were previously produced very little in my country, but this situation will undergo a major change. Some high-grade dyes and dye intermediates that used to rely on foreign imports will also be produced by the Jilin Dyestuff Plant. The completion of the Jilin Dyestuff Plant is a sign that my country has begun to have an independent chemical dye industry. The An'an Blue and Indanthrene produced by this factory in the future will be sufficient to supply the needs of the whole country. After the three major chemical plants are put into production, they will have a significant impact on my country's agricultural production increase and clothing supply. In the future, these three factories can cooperate and coordinate with each other in production, implement comprehensive utilization, and produce more chemical industrial products quickly, well, and economically. These three factories will also train a large number of chemical industry construction talents for our country.
    The three major chemical plants in Jilin were all designed with the help of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government and people supplied the best equipment to the three major chemical plants and sent a large number of experts to help with the work. From design and construction to putting into production, the Soviet Union provided comprehensive and selfless assistance.

    苏联供给最好装备传授先进经验
    吉林三大化工厂明天开工生产
    本报吉林23日电　吉林三大化工厂——吉林肥料厂、吉林染料厂、吉林电石厂决定在10月25日正式开工生产。23日举行了验收接交签字仪式。国家验收委员会认为，这三个化工厂的各项建设工程的质量都达到了设计要求。
    目前，吉林肥料厂已经全面投入生产，生产出的产品质量很好；其中硝酸铵（化学肥料）已经开始向农村供应。原计划在明年建成的吉林染料厂，已经有六个车间提前建成，并且试生产出第一批安安蓝染料和染料中间体。吉林电石厂也基本上建成了，正在大量生产电石，供应其他工业部门。现在这三个厂的职工正在积极准备迎接开工典礼。
    吉林三大化工厂的厂房工程都是在1955年年初动工的，本来计划在明年投入生产，现在都提前几个月完成了建厂和试生产任务。建设三大化工厂的全体职工根据党中央大力发展化学工业、支援农业生产的指示，千方百计地加快建设速度，尽力缩短工期，不到三年时间就完成了浩繁的建筑安装工程任务。仅是在厂房土木建筑工程中，职工们就挖掘了三百多万立方公尺的土方，砌了两亿多块砖。三个厂产品多样，技术复杂，生产过程千变万化，设备安装比较困难。各种繁杂的管道，共有几百公里长。它们互相重叠交错，平行对称，千头万绪。安装它们，既需要很好的技术，又需要密切的协作。建厂职工们在党的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助下，顺利地完成了这些任务。由于三个厂的建筑安装工程质量好，试车生产也都非常顺利，试生产出的第一批产品的质量就达到了设计要求的标准。
    吉林三大化工厂都是我国第一个五年计划期间的重点工程。它们提前投入生产，将使我国薄弱的化学工业前进一大步。像电石、合成氨、硝酸铵、安安蓝等类产品，我国过去都生产的很少，现在这种状况将有重大改变。曾经依靠外国进口的一些高级染料和染料中间体，也将要由吉林染料厂生产出来。吉林染料厂的建成，是我国开始有了独立的化学染料工业的标志。这个厂将来生产的安安蓝、阴丹士林，足够供应全国的需要。三大化工厂投入生产以后，对于我国农业增产和衣着供应都将有重大作用。这三个厂将来在生产上可以互相协作配合，实行综合利用，能够又快又好又省地生产出更多的化学工业产品。这三个厂还要为我国培养和训练出大批化学工业建设人才。
    吉林三大化工厂都是由苏联帮助设计的。苏联政府和人民把最好的设备供应给三大化工厂，还派出大批专家帮助工作。从设计、施工到投入生产，苏联都给予了全面无私的援助。
