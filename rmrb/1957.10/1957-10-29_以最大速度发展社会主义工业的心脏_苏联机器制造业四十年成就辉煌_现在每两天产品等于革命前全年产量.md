Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 28th: The Soviet machine manufacturing industry is the fastest-growing sector of the entire Soviet industry since the October Revolution. In the past forty years, the total output of Soviet industry has increased 33 times compared to 1913, while machine manufacturing has increased 200 times.

Currently, the total output of the Soviet machine manufacturing industry ranks first in Europe and second in the world. The machines and equipment manufactured in the Soviet Union every two days are equal to the entire year's output of Tsarist Russia.

The Soviet machine manufacturing industry was built almost from scratch. Before the October Revolution, the modernization of equipment in all of Russia was three times behind Britain, four times behind Germany, and nine times behind the United States, and almost half of the machines and equipment were imported. After the revolution, the Soviet machine manufacturing industry underwent fundamental changes. As a result of the realization of national industrialization, many new industrial sectors have been established one after another.

The machine tool manufacturing industry is a major sector of the Soviet machine manufacturing industry and has developed the fastest. In 1913, before the revolution, all of Russia manufactured only 1,500 metal-cutting machine tools, and the machine tool manufacturing industry had no independent status. Now, the Soviet machine tool manufacturing industry can manufacture 847 kinds of ordinary machine tools and thousands of specialized machine tools. Due to the development of this industrial sector, Soviet industry has established automated production lines, automated workshops, and even fully automated factories, which has greatly improved technology and labor productivity in industry. Last year, the mechanized and automated equipment manufactured by the machine tool manufacturing industry for the metallurgical industry alone increased by more than 24 times compared to 1932; its output of metal-cutting machine tools reached 124,000 units, an increase of more than 79 times compared to 1913. This year, the total number of various machine tools in the Soviet Union has reached 1.84 million. In terms of the number of machine tools, the Soviet Union has jumped to second place in the world, second only to the United States.

One of the latest achievements of the Soviet machine manufacturing industry is the successful manufacture of the "2500" rolling mill. This is a rolling mill used for continuous hot rolling of steel strips and plates with large widths and thicknesses. Its productivity reaches 3 million tons per year, and the maximum rolling speed is 12.1 meters per second.

The steam turbine manufacturing sector, which developed after 1920, plays a huge role in the implementation of national electrification. During the first five-year plan, the average power generation capacity of the combined engines manufactured by the Soviet Union was 2,500 kilowatts, 6,400 kilowatts during the second five-year plan, and 50,000 kilowatts during the fifth five-year plan. Now, some power stations in the Soviet Union have been equipped with 150,000-kilowatt steam turbines, boilers with 175 atmospheres of pressure and a temperature of 535 degrees Celsius, 110,000-kilowatt hydraulic turbines, and corresponding generators and other equipment.

The Soviet machine manufacturing industry also uses modern equipment to equip other industrial sectors such as coal mining, petroleum, and agriculture. At present, the supply of combined coal mining machines, coal cutters, conveyors, electric winches, etc., for the coal mining industry has doubled compared to 1954. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet machine manufacturing industry produced 322 new types of agricultural machinery for agricultural production. (Attached picture)

    以最大速度发展社会主义工业的心脏
    苏联机器制造业四十年成就辉煌
    现在每两天产品等于革命前全年产量
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联的机器制造工业是十月革命以后整个苏联工业部门中发展最快的一个。四十年来苏联工业的总产量增加为1913年的三十三倍，而机器制造业就增加为二百倍。
    目前，苏联机器制造工业的总产量已经占欧洲第一位，占世界第二位。苏联每两天制造出来的机器和设备就等于沙皇俄国全年的产量。
    苏联机器制造业几乎是在全新的基础上建设起来的。在十月革命以前，全俄国的生产装备的现代化程度比英国差三倍，比德国差四倍，比美国差九倍，而且几乎有一半的机器和装备是进口的。革命后，苏联机器制造业起了根本变化。由于实现了国家工业化的结果，许多新的工业部门都相继建立了起来。
    机床制造业是苏联机器制造业中的主要部门，而且发展得最快。在革命前的1913年，全俄国一共只制造了一千五百台金属切削机床，机床制造业没有独立的地位。现在，苏联的机床制造业已经能够制造八百四十七种普通机床和几千种专门机床。由于这一工业部门的发展，苏联的工业已经建立了自动化作业线，自动化车间，甚至全套自动化的工厂，使工业中的技术和劳动生产率得到了很大的提高。去年，机床制造业为冶金工业一个部门所制造的机械化和自动化设备，比1932年增加了二十四倍以上；它的金属切削机床的产量达到了十二万四千台，比1913年增加了七十九倍还多。今年，苏联各种机床的总数已经达到一百八十四万台。就机床数量来说，苏联已经跃居世界的第二位，仅次于美国。
    苏联机器制造业最新成就之一是
  “二五○○”式轧钢机的制造成功。这是一种用于连续热轧宽度和厚度都很大的钢条和钢板的轧钢机。它的生产率每年达三百万吨，轧钢的最高速度每秒为十二点一公尺。
    1920年以后发展起来的汽轮机制造部门在实行国家电气化过程中起着巨大的作用。在第一个五年计划期间，苏联制造的联动机的平均发电能力为二千五百瓩，第二个五年计划期间为六千四百瓩，而到第五个五年计划时就增加到了五万瓩。现在，苏联有些电力站已经装备了十五万瓩的蒸汽涡轮、有一百七十五个气压、温度达摄氏五百三十五度的锅炉、发电能力为十一万瓩的水力涡轮和相应的发电机及其他装备。
    苏联机器制造工业还用现代化的设备来装备采煤、石油、农业等其它工业部门。目前采煤工业用的联合机、割煤机、传送带、电力绞盘等的供应量比1954年增加了一倍。在第五个五年计划期间，苏联机器制造业为农业生产了三百二十二种新式的农业机械。（附图片）
