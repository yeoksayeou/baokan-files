Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: In the past two months, many cities and industrial and mining areas across the country have successively launched mass campaigns to severely crack down on bad elements such as theft and hooliganism, and have achieved great results.

During this struggle, various regions uncovered a batch of major cases, and arrested and sentenced a batch of thieves, rapists, murderers, arsonists, robbers, hooligans, and other bad elements who disrupted social order. Sun Longgen and other twelve hooligans arrested in Shanghai formed a gang that specialized in molesting and insulting women in crowded places, raping more than twenty women, and also luring more than twenty young workers into depravity and crime. Deng Zhonglu, a counter-revolutionary arsonist and illegal landlord sentenced to death by the Chongqing Municipal Court, attempted to kill farmer Su Guoan with a kitchen knife on the night of September 7th. Failing that, he set fire to Su's house, attempting to burn the entire Su family to death, resulting in three injuries, the destruction of six houses, and losses of more than two thousand yuan. Dong Qingbao, a habitual thief sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve by the Tianjin Municipal Court, had been arrested and sentenced three times, and escaped from prison three times to continue stealing. In April of this year, he fled from Changchun, stole goods in the suburbs of Changchun, and then fled to Tianjin. After arriving in Tianjin, he stole sixty cartons of cigarettes and more than five hundred yuan in cash from a non-staple food supply station. He took the stolen goods to Beijing for sale, and then fled to Suzhou and other places to continue stealing until he was arrested. In addition, during this struggle, various regions also took in a group of idlers who engaged in hooliganism, theft, fraud, and other acts that violated public security management, who repeatedly refused to be reformed despite repeated education, but did not need to be arrested and sentenced, for labor re-education.

While severely cracking down on theft and hooligan bad elements, various regions carried out extensive publicity through various forms such as public trials, symposiums, newspapers, radio stations, blackboard newspapers, and criminal offense evidence exhibitions. The broad masses were generally given an education in socialist morality and the legal system. In Shenyang City, more than 1.56 million people received education.

Through this struggle, the vigilance of the masses has been further improved, and they have actively reported bad elements to relevant departments. In Wuhan City, from the beginning of July to the end of September, the political and legal organs in only four districts received more than 6,000 pieces of materials from the masses reporting and accusing bad elements. In Luoyang City, in the month after launching this struggle, the masses assisted the government in solving 25 cases of theft and hooliganism, and captured 21 criminals in the act. Many industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, and organizations have tightened relevant systems and strengthened preventive measures through this struggle.

With the severe crackdown on criminals and the widespread action of the masses, bad elements have been initially deterred and have begun to waver and disintegrate. Some thieves and hooligans have voluntarily surrendered to the government, expressing their desire to abandon evil and return to good. In Beijing, from September 1st to 18th, 18 idlers voluntarily went to the Public Security Bureau requesting labor re-education.

In some areas, criminal cases have decreased, and social order has become more stable. In the Shangdalong area of the suburbs of Changsha City, before the struggle was launched, the activities of hooligans were very rampant. After dark, single women did not dare to pass through this area. After the struggle was launched, no hooligan activities have been found in the past two months. In the past, gambling was rampant in the Pipa Mountain Park in Chongqing City. After several gamblers were arrested and punished, no more gambling activities have been found.

Areas that have not yet launched this struggle are actively preparing. Areas that have already launched the struggle are further mobilizing the masses to dig out those hidden and disguised bad elements and criminals who have fled to other places in an attempt to "temporarily avoid the storm."

    各地狠狠打击盗窃、流氓分子
    群众积极协助破案，社会秩序更加安定
    据新华社24日讯　全国许多城市和工矿地区在最近两个月中，先后展开了严厉打击盗窃、流氓等坏分子的群众斗争，并且取得了很大成绩。
    各地在这个斗争中，破获了一批重大案件，逮捕、判处了一批盗窃犯、强奸犯、杀人犯、放火犯、抢劫犯、流氓阿飞和其他各种破坏社会秩序的坏分子。上海市逮捕的孙龙根等十二名流氓分子，曾组成集团，专门在热闹场所调戏污辱妇女，先后奸污妇女二十多人，还引诱二十多名青年工人堕落犯罪。被重庆市法院判处死刑的反革命放火犯、不法地主邓仲禄，曾在9月7日夜手执菜刀杀害农民苏国安未遂，便放火烧了苏的住屋，企图将苏全家烧死，结果烧伤三人，烧毁房屋六间，损失达两千多元。被天津市法院判处死刑缓期二年执行的惯窃犯董清宝，曾三次被捕判刑、三次越狱潜逃继续行窃。今年4月，他由长春潜逃，在长春市郊行窃后逃往天津，到天津后又在一个副食品供应站偷得香烟六十条和现款五百多元，将赃物携往北京销售后，又逃往苏州等地继续偷窃，一直到被捕。此外，各地还在这次斗争中收容了一批不务正业，有流氓、盗窃、诈骗等违反治安管理行为，屡教不改、但又不需逮捕判刑的坏人，进行劳动教养。
    在严厉打击盗窃、流氓坏分子的同时，各地通过公开审判、座谈会、报纸、广播台、黑板报、举办刑事犯罪罪证展览会等多种形式，展开广泛的宣传。广大群众普遍受到了一次社会主义道德教育和法制教育。沈阳市受到教育的群众就有一百五十六万多人次。
    经过这一斗争，群众的警惕性更加提高，积极向有关部门检举坏分子。武汉市从7月初到9月底，仅四个区的政法机关就收到群众检举、告发坏分子的材料六千多件。洛阳市开展这一斗争后的一个月中，群众就协助政府破获了二十五起盗窃、流氓案件，并捉到现行罪犯二十一名。许多工矿、企业、机关团体经过这一斗争，严密了有关的制度，加强了防范措施。
    在严厉打击犯罪分子和群众普遍行动起来的情况下，坏分子初步受到震慑，开始动摇分化。有的盗窃、流氓分子自动向政府投案自首，表示要改邪归正。北京市自9月1日到18日，就有十八名不务正业的游民分子自动到公安局要求劳动教养。
    有些地区刑事案件已减少，社会秩序更加安定。长沙市郊上大垅一带在开展斗争以前，流氓分子的活动十分猖獗，一到夜晚，单身妇女就不敢经过这一带；开展斗争后，两个月来没有发现流氓活动。重庆市枇杷山公园过去赌风很盛，逮捕法办了几个赌棍后，现在再没有发现赌博活动。
    目前，还没有开展这一斗争的地区，正在积极进行准备。已经展开斗争的地区，正在进一步深入发动群众，挖掘那些潜藏、伪装的坏分子和逃往外地企图“暂时避风”的犯罪分子。
