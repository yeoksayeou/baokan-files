    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 20th: "Al-Shaab" newspaper quoted the Director of the Egyptian Customs Department on the 19th, saying that the Soviet Union was the largest buyer of goods from Egypt in the first eight months of 1957, with trade exchange between the two countries reaching 37.8 million Egyptian pounds.

    He said that West Germany ranked second, and China ranked third. Trade with Britain has fallen to negligible figures, only a little over one million Egyptian pounds.

    According to official statistics, the United States, Britain, and West Germany were all in leading positions in Egypt's foreign trade last year.

    The Director also emphasized that Egypt now has a surplus in its foreign trade with most countries. During the above-mentioned period, its surplus in trade with the Soviet Union and China was approximately 8.5 million Egyptian pounds, and its surplus in trade with Czechoslovakia was 4 million Egyptian pounds. However, it still has a deficit in the trade balance with the United States, West Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries.

    在埃及对外贸易中苏联第一位中国第三位
    新华社开罗20日电  “人民报”19日引述埃及海关署署长的谈话说，苏联在1957年头8个月中是向埃及购买货物最多的一个国家，两国之间的贸易交换量达到三千七百八十万埃镑。
    他说，西德居第二位，中国居第三位。对英国的贸易降到了微不足道的数字，只有一百万埃镑多一点。
    据官方统计，美国、英国和西德在去年埃及的对外贸易中都处在领先的地位。
    署长还强调说，埃及现在同大多数国家的对外贸易都有了盈余。在上述时期，它在对苏联和中国的贸易中的盈余约八百五十万埃镑，在对捷克斯洛伐克的贸易中的盈余是四百万埃镑，但是，它在对美国、西德、荷兰和其他国家的贸易平衡方面仍有亏空。
