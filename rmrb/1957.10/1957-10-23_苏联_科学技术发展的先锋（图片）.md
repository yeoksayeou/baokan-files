    USSR—Pioneer of Scientific and Technological Development
    (1) The great achievements of the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy are reflected in: the construction of the world's first nuclear power plant in 1954. This is the central control room of the power plant.
      (2) The Soviet Union was the first to manufacture the "Tu-104" jet airliner with a speed of over 800 kilometers per hour. This aircraft began flying domestically and internationally last year.
      (3) The synchrophasotron built by the Soviet Union in April this year is the world's largest energy accelerator, capable of producing 10 billion electron volts.
      (4) In August this year, the Soviet Union successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. This is an innovation in the world of science and technology.
      (5) On October 4th, the Soviet Union successfully launched the world's first artificial Earth satellite. This artificial "moon" is still orbiting the Earth.
      (6) The world's first icebreaker equipped with a nuclear reactor, with immense power and the longest range, is being built in Leningrad and will be completed and launched within this year.

    苏联—科学技术发展的先锋
    （一）苏联和平利用原子能的伟大成就表现在：1954年建成了世界上第一个原子能发电站。这是发电站的中央指挥室。
      （二）苏联首次制成了每小时速度达八百公里以上的“图—一○四”喷气式客机。这种飞机去年开始在国内外飞行。
      （三）今年4月苏联建成的同步稳相加速器是世界上能量最大的加速器，它能产生一百亿电子伏特。
      （四）今年8月苏联发射洲际弹道火箭成功。这是世界科学技术界的创举。
      （五）10月4日，苏联发射成功了世界上第一颗人造地球卫星。这个人造“月亮”至今仍在围绕着地球旋转。
      （六）世界上第一艘装有原子反应堆的威力极大、航程最远的破冰船，正在列宁格勒制造，今年年内就要建成下水了。
