Newspaper Article Abstract

    First of all, I want to point out: if it were not for the Party's concern and leadership, so many young writers would not have emerged in recent years. This is an undeniable fact. Then, for young writers, since they have personally benefited from the Party's grace, how can they say that the Party should not lead literature and art, or that its leadership is wrong? This should be carefully considered.
    Some may say: The Party should cultivate young writers, but once they have writing skills, there is no need to lead them anymore. It would be best to let them have free rein and think independently. Is this statement correct? In my opinion, this is another idea of a "talented scholar." Since he is a "talented scholar," he naturally wants to be independent from the world and different from others. But what should he think independently about? This becomes the problem. Is it to think independently about bourgeois ideas? Is it to think independently about how to defend capitalists, like Zhang Naiqi, who said that fixed interest is not exploitation? Is it to think independently that socialism is not as good as capitalism? These have already been thought through by the rightists, so do we need to trouble ourselves again? However, some young writers today have responded to the fallacies of the rightists and also want to engage in independence. This proves that the Party's leadership is not strong enough, rather than that it should not lead. In fact, we should think about everything about socialism, because the socialist system is the newest system, and the problems of socialism are the newest problems. We should think so as to gather wisdom, consider deeply, and develop and consolidate socialism.
    A writer should always be ahead of the times in his thinking. Then, socialism is the most progressive ideology of mankind, and the Party's leadership precisely leads us to correctly take the socialist road. Is this not good? Is it a grievance for a "talented scholar"? If a "talented scholar" thinks that taking the socialist road and reflecting socialist construction is a grievance and a constraint, can he still be called a writer? Abandoning the noblest ideal of mankind, socialism, and engaging in wild thoughts, and calling it independent thinking, I think this is clearly confused thinking!
    The Party's leadership includes the Party's concern and assistance. Socialist construction is truly complex with countless threads. If a writer wants to reflect socialist reality, but only relies on personal understanding and experience, I am afraid it will be difficult to delve into the problem and understand it comprehensively. Therefore, the Party's leadership and assistance are indispensable. This is my personal experience. I am not a talented scholar, I need the Party's leadership and assistance. If I were a talented scholar, wouldn't my achievements be even greater with the Party's leadership and assistance? Is this the truth? Conversely, if I were a talented scholar, but refused to accept the Party's leadership, and even opposed the Party and socialism, then I would quickly become a rightist. What good is that? For myself, giving up the lofty ideal of socialism and willingly regressing ideologically by a hundred years, what kind of writer am I? It is simply not knowing what is good for me and not distinguishing between fragrant and foul. For the people, if I do not encourage socialist construction, but pour cold water and make sarcastic remarks, will the people agree? Looking at it this way, leadership is not limiting oneself, but to make everyone (including writers) wholeheartedly move towards socialism, becoming brighter and more free as they go.

### 青年作家为什么必须接受党的领导

    青年作家为什么必须接受党的领导
    首先我要指出来：假若没有党的关切与领导，这几年来根本不会出现这么多的青年作家。这是无可否认的事实。那么，对于青年作家来说，他们既身受党的恩惠，怎可以说党不该领导文艺，或领导错了呢？这应当好好地想一想。
    有人也许说：党应当培养青年作家，但一旦他们已经有了写作本领，便无须再领导了，顶好是让他们海阔天空，独立思考。这个说法正确吗？我看哪，这又是“才子”的想法。既是“才子”，当然想要遗世独立，与众不同。可是独立思考什么呢？这就成了问题。是独立思考资产阶级的思想吗？是独立思考怎么为资本家辩护，像章乃器那样，说定息不是剥削吗？是独立思考社会主义不如资本主义好吗？这些都已经被右派分子思考过了，还用再劳我们的驾吗；可是今天的某些青年作家响应了右派分子的谬论，也要搞独立。这就证明党的领导还不够强，而不是不该领导。事实上，我们应当思考社会主义的一切，因为社会主义制度是最新的制度，社会主义的问题是最新的问题，应当思考，以便集思广益，深谋远虑，发展并巩固社会主义。
    一个作家在思想上，总该走在时代的前面。那么，社会主义是人类最进步的思想，而党的领导恰恰是领导我们正确地走社会主义道路，这难道不好，难道是委屈了“才子”？一个“才子”而以为走社会主义道路，反映社会主义建设，便是受委屈，受束缚，还成其为作家吗？放下人类最崇高的理想的社会主义，而去胡思乱想，且美其名曰独立思考，我看哪，这分明是胡涂思考！
    党的领导包括着党的关切与帮助。社会主义建设真是千头万绪，极为复杂。作家要反映社会主义现实，而只凭个人的理解与体验，恐怕就很难深入问题，了解的不够全面。于是，非有党的领导与帮助不可。这是我亲身的经验。我不是才子，我需要党的领导与帮助。假若我是才子呢，有了党的领导与帮助，我的成就不是更大了吗？这是真话吧？反之，我若是才子，而不肯接受党的领导，以至反党反社会主义，那我就会很快地变成右派分子，这有什么好处呢？对我自己说，放弃了社会主义的崇高理想，而甘心在思想上倒退一百年，我还算个什么作家呢？简直是不知好歹，不辨香臭。对人民来说，我若不鼓舞社会主义的建设，而去泼冷水，说风凉话，人民答应不答应呢？这样看起来，领导不是限制自己，而是为使大家（包括作家）一心一意地走向社会主义，越走越光明，越自由。
