The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is the highest organ of state power in the Soviet Union and the representative organ of the Soviet people. It is the concrete embodiment of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and the standard-bearer in defense of world peace.

The Interests of Peace are Above All Else

As early as the second day after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, on November 8, 1917, the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets adopted the "Decree on Peace" signed by Lenin. This was the first decree of the Soviet regime, a document of worldwide historical significance. In this "Decree on Peace," the Soviet state declared the imperialist war to be "the gravest crime against humanity," calling on all countries participating in World War I to immediately cease military operations and to abandon the use of ultimatums and forced acceptance, considering them the worst means of resolving international disputes, and proposed the principle of peaceful consultation between countries. The entire history of the Soviet state's foreign relations is one of firmly implementing the basic principles of the peaceful foreign policy established by the "Decree on Peace."

The Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held on March 12, 1951, passed the "Law on the Defense of Peace," another document of great international significance following the "Decree on Peace." The international situation at that time was very tense, with Western countries led by the United States waging a war of aggression against Korea and unscrupulously carrying out war propaganda, attempting to develop this war into a new world war. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union used legislative procedures to guarantee the wishes and demands of millions of Soviet people, declaring that: (1) War propaganda in any form should be regarded as undermining the cause of peace and creating the threat of a new war, and therefore the most serious crime against humanity. (2) Anyone who commits the crime of war propaganda should be brought to court and tried as a heinous criminal. The passage of the "Law on the Defense of Peace" was an effective blow against all vicious war propagandists and a serious warning to the reactionary imperialist groups.

In recent years, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has passed a number of documents related to the defense of world peace, which have played a significant role in the cause of world peace and the endeavor for friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, becoming documents of international significance.

On June 19, 1950, the First Session of the Third Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, after hearing the report of the delegation from the Permanent Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace received by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, unanimously declared its support for the Stockholm Appeal of the Permanent Committee. The Stockholm Appeal called for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, the establishment of strict international control, and considered the first use of atomic weapons against the government of any country to be a war crime.

On February 9, 1955, the Second Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed a "Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union," emphasizing that the parliaments of all countries bear a major responsibility for maintaining and consolidating peace, calling on parliaments of all countries to establish direct contact, exchange parliamentary delegations, and advocate that parliamentary delegations of one country can deliver speeches in the parliaments of other countries. These practices are in line with the wishes of the people of all countries to develop friendly relations and cooperation. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will sincerely welcome any steps taken by the parliaments of other countries to strengthen peace. This declaration not only reflected the Soviet people's love of peace but also the universal demand of the people of the world for peace. It pointed out a way to ease international tensions and consolidate friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, and therefore received the support of world opinion and the parliaments of many countries.

On July 16, 1956, the Fifth Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed the "Appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the Parliaments of All Countries on the Question of Disarmament" and the "Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the Appeal of the Japanese Diet Concerning the Prohibition and Cessation of Nuclear Weapon (i.e., Atomic and Hydrogen Weapon) Tests." The Appeal to the Parliaments of All Countries on the Question of Disarmament pointed out that separate disarmament by countries is an extremely important measure to create conditions for the realization of a universal disarmament plan. Without waiting for the conclusion of a general disarmament agreement, the Soviet Union reduced its armed forces by 640,000 in 1955, and the Soviet Union also decided to reduce its armed forces by another 1.2 million before May 1, 1957. The Soviet Union's armaments, combat equipment, and defense expenditures will also be reduced accordingly. The Soviet Union assumed extremely important obligations for consolidating peace with this appeal, which directly ordered state administrative organs to change the state budget in terms of defense expenditures.

On May 10, 1957, the Seventh Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet passed a resolution agreeing to the Soviet government's policy and practical measures on the immediate and universal prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, and decided to send letters to the United States Congress and the British Parliament calling for a ban on nuclear weapon tests.

In contrast to the above, the parliaments of several Western countries led by the United States are organs composed of a majority of bourgeois representatives, and therefore the bills they pass actually represent the interests of the bourgeoisie and are means of creating international tensions, carrying out foreign aggression, and preparing for new wars. For example, on October 10, 1951, the United States Congress passed the so-called "Mutual Security Act," openly deciding to allocate 100 million US dollars to carry out subversive activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries; the most important piece of legislation of the first session of the Eighty-fifth United States Congress held in August this year was the passage of the notorious "Eisenhower Doctrine." After Congress passed this bill, the US government sent Richards to the Middle East to peddle this plan of aggression and soon afterwards instigated a coup in Jordan. As another example, the parliaments of capitalist countries such as the US, Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands approved aggressive treaties such as the Paris Agreement, the North Atlantic Treaty, the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, and the Baghdad Treaty. The parliaments of these countries are essentially tools for maintaining the interests of the bourgeoisie and suppressing the people.

Extensive Contacts with Parliaments of All Countries

The extensive contacts between the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the parliaments and parliamentarians of all countries, as well as the mutual exchange of parliamentary delegations, play an important role in developing friendly cooperation among the people of all countries and promoting peaceful coexistence among countries with different social and political systems. As mentioned earlier, the declaration passed by the Second Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on February 9, 1955, put forward the initiative to establish direct contact between the parliaments of all countries. On June 29, 1955, representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held a meeting and decided, in accordance with the spirit of the aforementioned declaration, to form a national parliamentary group of the Soviet Union and participate in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Similar resolutions were also passed at the representative meetings of the Supreme Soviets of the Ukrainian and Belorussian Republics.

Since then, the contacts between the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the parliaments of all countries have become increasingly frequent, and the mutual visits of parliamentary delegations have also increased. Parliamentary delegations from Finland, Britain, India, Sweden, Syria, Yugoslavia, Japan, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Albania, Austria, Poland, Iran, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Brazil, Pakistan, Greece, Norway, Indonesia, China, the German Democratic Republic, Ceylon and other countries have visited the Soviet Union. US Senator Dvorchak and others also visited the Soviet Union in September 1955. During their stay in the Soviet Union, these foreign parliamentarians had extensive contact with representatives of the Supreme Soviet and local Soviets, leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, activists from all walks of life, and ordinary people; they visited the Soviet Union's constituent republics and important cities, toured Soviet industrial construction and collective farms as well as places of interest; some also participated in the sessions of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and delivered speeches at the meetings.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has very close ties and comradely cooperative relations with the parliaments of fraternal countries and some nationalist countries. Recently, the connections with parliamentary groups from India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, Sudan and other countries have also been expanding and strengthening; the meetings between representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and parliamentarians from Liberia, Iraq, Laos and Thailand have also been beneficial.

Since the publication of the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1955, delegations from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have visited Finland, Poland, Albania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Belgium, Sweden, Luxembourg, Romania, Austria, Britain, Syria, Iran and other countries. Recently, a delegation from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Aristov came to China for a visit.

In order to expand the parliamentary contacts between representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and members of the French Parliament that are conducive to the development of relations between the two countries, the National Parliamentary Group of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union established the Soviet-French Parliamentary Group on October 8, 1956, and expressed satisfaction with the establishment of the French-Soviet Parliamentary Group under the National Assembly and the Senate of the Republic of France. On May 30 this year, the Soviet-French Parliamentary Group, at a regular meeting held in Moscow, passed an appeal to the French-Soviet Parliamentary Group of the Senate of the Republic and the National Assembly, suggesting that the two parliamentary groups jointly discuss measures to further improve Soviet-French relations and strengthen peace and security in Europe.

Passing Bills for Peaceful Economic Construction

The motions of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union at its successive meetings, such as deliberating on annual or long-term economic and cultural construction plans, people's welfare issues, and passing annual budget laws, etc., also show that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union fully reflects the domestic policy of the Soviet Union's peaceful construction. For example, the 1957 Soviet National Budget Law passed by the Sixth Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on February 9 this year, allocates a large amount of funds to ensure the further high tide of communist construction and the further improvement of the people's living standards, while defense expenditures are reduced once again, accounting for only 16% of the total budget expenditures (18% last year). The parliaments of capitalist countries are completely contrary to this, and the motions they discuss and pass are all for the bourgeoisie to exploit and oppress the domestic working people and to carry out expansionist and aggressive policies abroad. For example, the first session of the Eighty-fifth United States Congress passed bills to allocate large sums of money to support the US government's arms expansion and aggressive plans: it allocated more than 30 billion US dollars for the US government's military expenses, and more than 3.4 billion US dollars for the US government's "foreign aid" expenses. Such huge military and "foreign aid" appropriations will inevitably increase the burden on American taxpayers, especially the working people, reduce their income, and lower their living standards.

During the decades of its existence, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has made many important and beneficial contributions to defending world peace and strengthening friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, and therefore it is loved and respected not only by the Soviet people but also by peace-loving people all over the world.

    为和平而斗争的苏联最高苏维埃
    章叶
    苏联最高苏维埃是苏联的最高国家权力机关，是苏联人民的代表机关。它是苏联和平外交政策的具体体现者，是保卫世界和平的旗手。
    和平的利益高于一切
    远在伟大十月社会主义革命胜利的第二天，1917年11月8日，第二次全俄苏维埃大会就通过了列宁签署的“和平法令”，这是苏维埃政权的第一个法令，是一个具有全世界历史意义的文件。在这个“和平法令”中，苏维埃国家宣布帝国主义战争是“对于人类最严重的罪行”，号召参加第一次世界大战的一切国家立即停止军事行动，摒弃用最后通牒和强迫接受的方式，认为那是解决国际争端的最恶劣的手段，并且提出了各国间和平协商的原则。苏维埃国家的全部对外关系史就是坚决执行“和平法令”所确定的和平外交政策的基本原则。
    1951年3月12日举行的第三届苏联最高苏维埃第二次会议通过了一项“保卫和平法”，这是苏联继“和平法令”后又一个具有重大国际意义的文件。当时的国际局势非常紧张，以美国为首的西方国家正在进行侵略朝鲜的战争，并肆无忌惮地进行战争的宣传，力图把这一战争发展成为新的世界大战。苏联最高苏维埃用立法程序保证千千万万苏联人民的愿望和要求，宣布：（一）不论是任何形式的战争宣传，都应视为破坏和平事业、制造新战争威胁，因而是危害人类的最严重的罪行。（二）凡犯宣传战争罪行者应交付法庭，作为罪大恶极的罪犯加以审讯。“保卫和平法”的通过，是对一切恶毒的战争宣传者的有效打击，是对帝国主义反动集团的严重警告。
    最近几年来，苏联最高苏维埃通过了一些有关保卫世界和平的文件，对世界和平与争取各国人民友好合作事业起着重大作用，成为具有国际意义的文件。
    1950年6月19日，第三届苏联最高苏维埃第一次会议在听取了苏联最高苏维埃接待世界拥护和平大会常设委员会代表团的报告后，一致声明拥护该会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩宣言。斯德哥尔摩宣言要求无条件禁止原子武器，要求建立严格的国际管制，并认为首先使用原子武器去反对任何国家的政府为战犯。
    1955年2月9日，第四届苏联最高苏维埃第二次会议通过一项“苏联最高苏维埃的宣言”，强调指出各国议会对维护和巩固和平负有重大的责任，号召各国议会之间建立直接的接触、互派议会代表团、提倡一国的议会代表团可以在他国的议会中发表演说。这些做法是符合各国人民发展友好关系和合作的愿望的。苏联最高苏维埃将诚恳地欢迎其他国家的议会为加强和平而采取的任何步骤。这个宣言不仅反映了苏联人民爱好和平的意愿，同时也反映了全世界人民爱好和平的普遍要求，它指出了一条缓和国际紧张局势和巩固各国人民友好合作的道路，因此受到世界舆论和许多国家议会的支持。
    1956年7月16日，第四届苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议通过了“苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题致各国议会的呼吁书”和“苏联最高苏维埃就日本国会关于禁止和停止试验核子武器（即原子武器和氢武器）的呼吁书的声明”。在就裁军问题致各国议会的呼吁书中指出，各国单独裁军是为实现普遍裁军计划创造条件的极为重要的措施。苏联不等总的裁军协定的达成，就在1955年裁减了自己的武装部队六十四万人，苏联还决定在1957年5月1日以前再把武装部队裁减一百二十万人。苏联的军备、战斗装备以及国防费用也将作相当的缩减。苏联用这个呼吁书为巩固和平承担了极其重大的义务，这个呼吁书直接命令国家管理机关改变国防费用方面的国家预算。
    1957年5月10日，第四届最高苏维埃第七次会议通过一项决议，同意苏联政府关于立即普遍禁止原子武器和氢武器试验的政策和实际措施，并决定致函美国国会和英国议会呼吁禁止核武器试验。
    与上述情况相反，以美国为首的若干西方国家的议会，则是由大多数资产阶级的代表组成的机关，因而它所通过的法案实际上都是代表资产阶级利益、为制造国际紧张局势、对外进行侵略和准备新战争的手段。例如，1951年10月10日，美国国会通过所谓“共同安全法”，公然决定拨款一亿美元来对苏联和人民民主国家进行颠覆活动；今年8月间举行的美国第八十五届国会第一期会议最重要的一项立法就是通过了臭名远扬的“艾森豪威尔主义”。在国会通过这个法案后，美国政府曾派理查兹到中东去兜售这个侵略计划，随后不久在约旦策动了政变。又如，美、英、法、意、比、荷等资本主义国家的议会批准了巴黎协定、北大西洋公约、东南亚集体防务条约、巴格达条约等侵略性条约。这些国家的议会，实质上都是维护资产阶级利益和镇压人民的工具。
    同各国议会广泛接触
    苏联最高苏维埃同各国议会和议员间的广泛接触以及互派议会代表团访问，对发展各国人民间的友好合作、促进不同社会和政治制度的国家和平共处起着重大作用。前面说过，1955年2月9日第四届苏联最高苏维埃第二次会议通过的宣言，提出了建立各国议会之间直接接触的倡议。1955年6月29日，苏联最高苏维埃代表举行会议，决定根据上述宣言的精神，组成苏联全国议员团并参加各国议会联盟。在乌克兰和白俄罗斯共和国最高苏维埃代表会议上，也通过了类似的决议。
    从这以后，苏联最高苏维埃同各国议会之间的接触日益频繁，同各国议会代表团的互相访问也增多了。芬兰、英国、印度、瑞典、叙利亚、南斯拉夫、日本、比利时、法国、卢森堡、阿尔巴尼亚、奥地利、波兰、伊朗、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、巴西、巴基斯坦、希腊、挪威、印度尼西亚、中国、德意志民主共和国、锡兰等国议会代表团都访问了苏联。美国参议员德沃夏克等也在1955年9月间访问过苏联。这些外国议员在逗留苏联期间，同苏联最高苏维埃和地方苏维埃的代表、苏联共产党和政府的领导人、各界活动家以及普通人民进行广泛的接触；访问了苏联各加盟共和国和重要城市，参观了苏联的工业建设和集体农庄以及名胜古迹；有的还参加了苏联最高苏维埃的会议，并在会上发表了演说。
    苏联最高苏维埃同各兄弟国家和一些民族主义国家的议会联系和同志般的合作关系是非常密切的。最近期间同印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、苏丹等国议员团的联系也日益扩大和加强了；苏联最高苏维埃代表同利比里亚、伊拉克、老挝和泰国等国议员的会见也是有益的。
    从1955年苏联最高苏维埃宣言发表以后，苏联最高苏维埃代表团曾先后访问了芬兰、波兰、阿尔巴尼亚、南斯拉夫、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、比利时、瑞典、卢森堡、罗马尼亚、奥地利、英国、叙利亚、伊朗等国。最近以阿里斯托夫同志为首的苏联最高苏维埃代表团前来中国访问。
    苏联最高苏维埃全国议员团为了扩大苏联最高苏维埃代表和法国议会议员之间有利于发展两国关系的议会联系，在1956年10月8日成立苏法议员团，并对法国议会在国民议会和共和国参议院之下设立法苏议员团表示满意。今年5月30日，苏法议员团在莫斯科举行的例会上，通过一项向法国共和国参议院和国民议会法苏议员团发出呼吁书，建议两个议员团共同讨论进一步改善苏法关系的措施以及加强欧洲和平和安全的问题。
    通过和平经济建设议案
    苏联最高苏维埃历次会议的议案，如审议年度的或长期的经济和文化建设计划、人民福利问题，以及通过年度预算法等，也表明了苏联最高苏维埃充分反映苏联和平建设的国内政策。例如，今年2月9日第四届苏联最高苏维埃第六次会议通过的1957年苏联国家预算法，把大量资金用来保证共产主义建设的进一步高涨和人民生活水平的进一步提高，而国防费用则再一次降低，只占预算全部开支的16％（去年是18％）。资本主义国家的议会则完全与此相反，它们所讨论和通过的议案，都是为资产阶级剥削和压迫国内劳动人民和对外进行扩张侵略政策服务的。例如，美国第八十五届国会第一期会议通过拨出大笔款项支持美国政府扩充军备和侵略计划的法案：拨出了三百几十亿美元作为美国政府的军费，拨出了三十四亿多美元作为美国政府的“援外”费用。这种庞大的军费和“援外”拨款，必然要加重美国纳税人首先是劳动人民的负担，使他们的收入减少，生活水平下降。
    苏联最高苏维埃在它存在的几十年期间，为保卫世界和平和加强各国人民之间的友好合作，作了许多重要而有益的贡献，因而它不仅受到苏联人民，而且受到世界各国爱好和平的人民的爱戴和尊敬。
