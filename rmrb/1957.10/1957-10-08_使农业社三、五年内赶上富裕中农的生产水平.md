Enable Agricultural Cooperatives to Catch Up with the Production Level of Rich Middle Peasants Within Three to Five Years
Liang Shuangbi, First Secretary of the CPC Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee

All Agricultural Cooperatives Can Catch Up with or Exceed the Level of Rich Middle Peasants Within Five Years

Shijiazhuang Prefecture has 5,933 agricultural cooperatives in twenty-five counties, with peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 99.9% of the total peasant households. In this region, grain crops account for 65.73% of the total cultivated land area, with an average yield of approximately 230 jin per mu; cash crops account for 25.17% of the total cultivated land area, with cotton accounting for over 20%, and an average yield of ginned cotton of around 40 jin per mu. Due to the low grain yield in this prefecture and its status as a cash crop area, it cannot achieve grain self-sufficiency annually. Therefore, rapidly increasing agricultural production, achieving grain self-sufficiency, and increasing the income of cooperative members have become our fundamental tasks in consolidating agricultural cooperatives within three to five years. To solve this problem, based on the "National Agricultural Development Program" (draft) and the situation in our region, we have proposed a plan to gradually realize this program: First, from 1958 to 1962, enable all agricultural cooperatives to catch up with the production level of rich middle peasants; Second, achieve the goal of 400 jin of grain per mu by 1967.

To achieve the first step of the plan, leading cadres from the prefectural and county committees personally investigated thirty-nine agricultural cooperatives in different regions and of different types this spring. During the investigation, they exchanged views with poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and rich middle peasants on how to enable the production of the cooperatives to catch up with the production level of rich middle peasants. The poor peasants were very confident, saying: "It won't take five years to catch up with production."

After key investigations, comprehensive planning, joint research, and revisions from top to bottom, a plan to catch up with rich middle peasants was proposed. Looking at the situation of agricultural cooperatives in the entire region, by 1962, the grain yield per mu can reach about 300 jin, and the yield of ginned cotton per mu can exceed that of rich middle peasants, reaching around 55 jin. In the past two years, a total of 841 cooperatives (accounting for 14.16% of the total number of cooperatives) in the region have caught up with or exceeded the production level of rich middle peasants. In 1958, 1,313 cooperatives can catch up with the production level of rich middle peasants, and by 1962, all agricultural cooperatives in the region can catch up with or exceed the production level of rich middle peasants. At the same time, twenty-three of the twenty-five counties in the region can achieve grain self-sufficiency.

What is the basis of this plan? Is there any certainty of achieving it? After repeated analysis and research, we believe that it is positive, steady, and reliable. As long as we do our work well and do not make major mistakes, it is possible to complete this plan.

According to the typical investigation of thirty-nine cooperatives of different types in different regions of the prefecture, the production level of agricultural cooperatives is generally 20% to 30% lower than that of rich middle peasants, with the smallest difference being about 10% and the largest being 35%. According to the investigation of thirty different cooperatives, the current production level is: 265 jin of grain per mu and 42 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Rich middle peasants produce 302 jin of grain per mu and 51 jin of ginned cotton per mu. If specific planning is carried out, production potential is tapped, and every effort is made to increase production, some cooperatives can catch up with the production level of rich middle peasants in one year, some in two years, and most in three years. For example, Shenhou Agricultural Cooperative in Huolu County has only 20 mu of paddy field out of 3,499 mu of cultivated land. After the establishment of the advanced cooperative, it focused on developing water conservancy and built a canal network throughout the village, turning 3,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields, increasing the yield by 75 jin per mu, and catching up with the production level of rich middle peasants in the same year. In Wangjiazhuang Cooperative in Zhengding County, all the cultivated land is irrigated. In the plan, it focused on several aspects: raising more pigs to accumulate more fertilizer, expanding multiple cropping, and increasing the planting of high-yield crops. It can exceed the production level of rich middle peasants in the next two years. Typical investigations have also proved that the cooperatives that can catch up with the production level of rich middle peasants in two or three years are not entirely well-managed cooperatives. Over the past few years, the vast number of cooperatives have gained a lot of experience in managing large-scale production, and have also been tempered by resisting natural disasters and anti-socialist countercurrents. Therefore, we believe that there are conditions and certainty to catch up with or exceed the production level of rich middle peasants in five years.

We found the basis for catching up with the production level of rich middle peasants by studying the characteristics of rich middle peasant production and the characteristics of the cooperatives, and formulated measures to increase production.

Characteristics of Rich Middle Peasant Production

The characteristics of rich middle peasants are: more land, better quality, more livestock, stronger livestock, complete production tools, and abundant production funds. They possess more and better means of production than ordinary peasants. According to the investigation of thirty cooperatives: agricultural cooperatives have an average of three mu of land per person, and an average of thirty-eight mu of land per livestock, with mules and horses accounting for only 10.4% of the livestock. Rich middle peasants have three point zero eight mu of land per person, and an average of twenty-six mu of land per livestock, with mules and horses accounting for 20% of the livestock. In addition to having better means of production than the cooperatives, their outstanding experiences in increasing production include three points:

1.  Raising more pigs and applying more fertilizer. Rich middle peasants in the region raise an average of one and a half to two pigs per household. Agricultural cooperatives in the region only raise an average of zero point eight three pigs per household. For example, rich middle peasants in Hejiazhuang, Hengshui County, have one pig for every twenty-five mu of land, while cooperatives have one pig for every thirty-four mu of land. Rich middle peasants apply an average of three to four cartloads of fertilizer per mu, which is one-third more than agricultural cooperatives.

2.  Large multiple cropping area and good crop rotation. According to the investigation of Xinchengpu, Wangjiazhuang, Dongjiazhuang, Hantong in Zhengding County and Gangtou Cooperative in Xinle, the average multiple cropping index of rich middle peasants is 162%, while the average multiple cropping index of agricultural cooperatives is 148%, a difference of 14%. Rich middle peasants do a better job in crop rotation, intercropping, and mixed planting. They consider the crop rotation carefully and plan what to plant in the next year.

3.  Careful cultivation and harvesting every grain. Rich middle peasants are generally hardworking, and can cultivate the land deeply, evenly, straightly, finely, and uniformly. They harrow and cover the land more to retain moisture, and sow in a timely manner. They master the three key links of deepness, fineness, and ventilation in hoeing. They grasp the three key points of "leaving sparse when dense, leaving dense when sparse, and leaving the larger ones when neither sparse nor dense" in seedling setting. Their crops are hoed one or two more times than ordinary peasants, watered one or two more times, and pruned two more times. The seedlings are uniform and strong, the ground is free of weeds, and the crops are a head taller. They harvest every grain of the crops.

The Superiority of Agricultural Cooperatives - Beyond the Reach of Rich Middle Peasants

Rich middle peasants have the culmination of small-scale agricultural production experience, and they have their strengths. After cooperativization, they can still be teachers for agricultural cooperatives for a few years. However, from a fundamental perspective, the superiority of agricultural cooperatives is beyond the reach of rich middle peasants.

The characteristics of agricultural cooperatives are: collective ownership of means of production, more people, concentrated strength, and contiguous land.

1.  Able to carry out large-scale basic construction, turn the land upside down, and achieve substantial increases in production. Due to contiguous land and concentrated labor, large-scale operations can be carried out in well drilling, canal digging, dam construction, land reclamation, transformation of low-lying saline-alkali land, and road planning, creating conditions for rapid and substantial increases in production.

2.  Able to launch crash production, rush harvesting and planting, and overcome natural disasters. Due to the large number of people and strength, in crash production such as spring sowing, summer planting, weeding, and harvesting, we can concentrate our efforts and complete them in a timely manner. In the struggle against drought, flood, insect pests, and frost, we can exert great power.

3.  Able to plant according to local conditions and make the best use of the land. It is more superior to rich middle peasants in popularizing new agricultural tools, selecting improved varieties, and technological reforms.

Several Measures

Based on the different situations in the region and the above characteristics, several measures were proposed to catch up with the production of rich middle peasants:

I. Building water conservancy projects to turn dry land into paddy fields. We must concentrate our efforts to solve the water problem, focusing on farmland water conservancy, flood prevention, soil and water conservation, river improvement, and drainage. In addition to soil and water conservation measures such as building gullies, embankments, terraces, closing hillsides for afforestation, raising grass, and protecting slopes in mountainous areas, we also plan to expand the irrigated area by a total of 3.31 million mu by 1962 through well drilling (machine wells, power wells, cone wells, brick and stone wells, river-penetrating wells, etc.), canal digging, development of winter irrigation in canals (which can expand irrigation by 150,000 mu), building small reservoirs (1,020), building pumping stations, and utilizing water pits. In addition, the use of the Fuyang River to store floodwater and irrigate in the Jiheng Qianqingwa (a large area of depression between Ji County and Hengshui) can turn water disasters into water conservancy and irrigate 500,000 mu of land. In this way, the irrigated area in the region can be increased from the original 6.77 million mu to more than 10 million mu (excluding flood storage and irrigation in Qianqingwa). Divided by region, the nine counties in the central part basically eliminate dry land; in the eight counties in the mountainous area, paddy fields account for 52.8% of the cultivated land, and each person can have 1.4 mu of paddy fields; in the eight counties in the eastern part, paddy fields account for 43.7% of the cultivated land, and each person has an average of more than 1.6 fen of paddy fields.

II. Accumulating more fertilizer and raising more pigs. In addition to applying as much fine fertilizer and chemical fertilizer as possible, the increase in production basically depends on increasing coarse fertilizer. The increase in coarse fertilizer depends on raising more pigs. There are currently 1.06 million pigs in the region (exceeding the historical peak), an average of 0.81 pigs per household, one pig for every 15.4 mu of cultivated land, and an average of about 3,500 jin of coarse fertilizer applied per mu. It is planned to develop the number of pigs to 2.5 million by 1962, an average of two pigs per household, one pig for every 6.5 mu of cultivated land, and an average of about 6,000 jin of coarse fertilizer applied per mu. At the same time, vigorously develop draught animals and sheep.

III. Expanding the multiple cropping area, increasing the land utilization rate, planting high-yield crops according to local conditions, popularizing improved varieties, and promoting advanced agricultural technologies. The multiple cropping index in the region has increased from 124.3% in 1953 to 139.8%. With the development of farmland water conservancy, the multiple cropping index will increase year by year, increasing to 150% by 1962.

The region currently has a total of 4.26 million mu of high-yield crops, which will be expanded to 5.05 million mu by 1962. Various improved varieties of main crops will be popularized before 1962. At the same time, advanced agricultural technologies will be vigorously promoted, mainly by summarizing and popularizing the advanced experience of the local masses; careful cultivation and harvesting every grain will be implemented.

IV. Measures to increase production in different regions:

In the eight counties in the east, paddy fields account for only 4% of the cultivated land, and there are also 1 million mu of alkaline land. These eight counties have rough cultivation and very low yields. In addition to focusing on turning dry land into paddy fields, the main focus is on: 1. Leveling the land and using the wells that have been drilled; 2. Changing the rough cultivation situation and changing the dense planting of ridge sowers (changing the 1.8-foot ridge sowers to 9-inch ridge sowers, which can increase the yield by 10-20 jin of grain per mu), eliminating missing seedlings; 3. Transforming alkaline land: building earthen embankments and applying more fertilizer; planting alkali-resistant crops (such as planting alfalfa, sunflowers, brooms, and red tamarix); covering the soil with sand to improve the soil, building terrace fields, and striving to transform the alkaline land that can be transformed within three to five years.

The nine counties in the central part are irrigated land with high yields. The main focus is on: 1. Planting two seasons of crops, intercropping, and multiple cropping; 2. Reasonable close planting; 3. The central part is a cotton-producing area, and the increase in cotton production focuses on three key links: timely sowing, insect control during the dry season, and fine pruning.

The eight counties in the west are mountainous and semi-mountainous areas. It is necessary to rely on agricultural cooperatives to expand the cultivated land area and improve the soil on the premise of comprehensively carrying out soil and water conservation to strive for grain self-sufficiency; at the same time, it is necessary to develop forestry, fruit trees, animal husbandry, breeding, and a variety of local specialties in accordance with local conditions.

Strengthening Party Leadership to Ensure the Realization of the Plan

To ensure the realization of the plan, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party. For this reason, it is particularly important to grasp the following three important tasks:

I. Political and ideological work. Political and ideological work is the driving force for promoting production and the soul for realizing the plan. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a debate-style approach, combined with the actual situation, to regularly conduct education on the two roads of socialism and capitalism among the masses to consolidate and expand the socialist ideological front, so that peasants clearly establish the idea of building the country diligently and thriftily, running the cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and managing the household diligently and thriftily, mobilize all positive factors, unify the thinking and actions inside and outside the Party, and ensure the realization of the plan.

II. In the plan to catch up with rich middle peasants and consolidate agricultural cooperatives, it is particularly important to grasp the annual plan for realizing the long-term plan. We are formulating plans to consolidate agricultural cooperatives within three to five years from the prefectural committee to the county, township, and cooperative levels. This plan is closely related to the production plan to catch up with rich middle peasants. With this plan, agricultural cooperatives can gradually get on the right track in democratic management, diligent and thrifty management, production management, labor organization, and financial work. In this way, there is a greater guarantee for catching up with the production level of rich middle peasants.

III. Investigation and research to solve new problems. After agricultural cooperativization, new problems in rural areas are emerging like mushrooms, but many cadres are accustomed to the old leadership methods. Some cadres are satisfied with holding meetings to listen to reports, making suggestions in the office, and copying the instructions of higher authorities when arranging work, and cannot arrange work well in combination with the characteristics of the local area. If this situation is not changed, the plan to catch up with the production level of rich middle peasants and the plan of 400 jin of grain per mu will not be realized. The way to change this situation is for responsible cadres of the prefectural committee, county committee, and government to personally "take command" and go deep into the masses to conduct investigation and research with a certain number of assistants in a purposeful and planned manner. This is an important issue to overcome subjectivism and change the style of leadership. For this reason, we have determined that the issues of water, fertilizer, and livestock will be managed by the responsible persons of the Party, government, and cooperative from top to bottom so as to thoroughly study and solve the key issues in production.

    使农业社三、五年内赶上富裕中农的生产水平
    中共石家庄地委第一书记　梁双璧
    五年内全部农业社都可赶上或超过富裕中农水平
    石家庄专区二十五个县共有五千九百三十三个农业社，入社农户占总农户的99.9％。这个地区粮食作物占总耕地面积65.73％，耕地每亩平均产量二百三十斤左右；经济作物占总耕地面积25.17％，其中棉花占20％以上，每亩平均皮棉产量四十斤上下。由于这个专区粮食产量低，又是经济作物区，每年粮食不能自给。因此，迅速提高农业生产，实现粮食自给，增加社员收入，就成了我们在三、五年内巩固农业社的根本任务。为了解决这个问题，我们根据全国“农业发展纲要”（草案）和我区的情况，提出了逐步实现这个纲要的计划：第一步，在1958年到1962年使所有农业社赶上富裕中农的生产水平；第二步，到1967年实现粮食亩产四百斤的目标。
    为了实现第一步计划，今年春天地委、县委负责人曾经亲自动手，调查了三十九个不同地区和不同类型的农业社。在调查研究的过程中，同贫农、下中农、富裕中农交换了关于如何使社的生产赶上富裕中农生产水平的意见。贫农信心很强，说：“赶生产用不了五年。”
    经过重点调查，全面规划，共同研究，上下修改，提出了一个赶上富裕中农的规划。从全区农业社的情况看，到1962年粮食每亩产量可达三百斤左右，每亩皮棉产量可超过富裕中农，达五十五斤上下。全区过去两年共有八百四十一个社（占总社数14.16％）赶上或超过富裕中农的生产水平。1958年可以有一千三百一十三个社赶上富裕中农生产水平，到1962年全区的农业社都可以赶上或超过富裕中农的生产水平。同时，全区二十五个县中有二十三个县可以实现粮食自给。
    这个规划的根据何在？究竟有没有把握实现？经过反复分析研究，我们认为它是积极稳妥可靠的，只要我们做好工作，不犯大的错误，完成这个计划是可能的。
    根据全区不同地区不同类型的三十九个社的典型调查，农业社的生产水平一般比富裕中农低20％到30％左右，相差最少的是10％左右，相差最多的是35％。据三十个不同社的调查，现有生产水平是：亩产粮食二百六十五斤，亩产皮棉四十二斤。富裕中农亩产粮食三百零二斤，亩产皮棉五十一斤。如果进行具体规划，挖生产潜力，千方百计地提高生产，有的社经过一年即可赶上富裕中农的生产水平，有的社只要二年，多的也只要三年。如获鹿县申后农业社，耕地三千四百九十九亩中，仅有二十亩水地。成立高级社后，抓住了开展水利，修成了遍及全村的渠道网，使三千亩旱地变成了水田，每亩增产七十五斤，当年就赶上了富裕中农的生产水平。正定县王家庄社耕地都是水浇地，在规划中便抓住了多养猪多积肥、扩大复播、增种高产作物这几个环节，今后两年就可以超过富裕中农的生产水平。典型调查还证明，二、三年内可以赶上富裕中农生产水平的社，不完全是办得好的社。几年来，广大的合作社已经取得了不少经营管理大生产的经验，也经受过抗御天灾和反社会主义逆流的锤炼，因此，我们相信，在五年内赶上或超过富裕中农的生产水平，是有条件有把握的。
    我们从研究富裕中农生产的特点和社的特点当中找出了赶上富裕中农生产水平的根据，制定了增加生产的措施。
    富裕中农生产的特点
    富裕中农的特点是：土地多，质量好，牲口多，牲口壮，生产工具齐全，生产资金充裕，占有各种生产资料比一般农民多、好。据三十个社调查：农业社每人平均三亩地，每畜平均三十八亩地，骡马仅占牲畜的10.4％。富裕中农每人三点零八亩地，每畜平均二十六亩地，骡马占牲畜的20％。除了生产资料比社好以外，他们的增产经验突出的有三条：
    1、养猪多，施肥多。全区富裕中农平均每户养一口半到两口猪。全区农业社平均每户才养零点八三口猪。如衡水县何家庄富裕中农平均二十五亩地一口猪，社内平均三十四亩地一口猪。富裕中农每亩地平均施肥三、四车，比农业社多三分之一。
    2、复播面积大，倒茬轮作好。据正定县新城铺、王家庄、董家庄、韩通和新乐岗头社的调查，富裕中农平均复播指数为162％，农业社平均复播指数为148％，相差14％。富裕中农对倒茬轮作、间作、混种搞的较好，他们对茬口考虑得周到，今年就有了明年倒茬种什么的打算。
    3、精耕细作，颗粒还家。富裕中农一般是勤劳的，耕地能做到深、平、直、细、匀，耙盖多，保墒好，播种适时。锄地掌握了深、细、通三个环节。定苗抓住了“稀留密，密留稀，不稀不密留大的”三个关键。他们的庄稼比一般农民多锄一两遍，多浇一两次水，多整两次枝，苗齐、苗壮，地无杂草，庄稼高出一头。收获庄稼是颗粒还家。
    农业社的优越性  富裕中农望尘莫及
    富裕中农集小农生产经验的大成，有他们的长处，合作化以后还可以给农业社当几年先生。但是，如果从根本方面看，农业社的优越性却是富裕中农望尘莫及的。
    农业社的特点是：生产资料为集体所有，人多，力量集中，土地联片。
    1、能进行大的基本建设，使土地大翻身，实现大量增产。由于土地联片，劳力集中，在打井、开渠、修坝、成滩、改造低洼盐碱土地、规划道路等方面可以大规模进行，为迅速大量增产创造条件。
    2、能突击生产，抢收抢种，战胜自然灾害。由于人多力量大，在春播夏种，锄草灭荒，争秋夺麦等突击性的生产中，可以集中力量，及时完成。在抗旱保收，防汛排涝，捕虫灭蝗，防风防霜等斗争中，能够发挥巨大威力。
    3、能做到因地种植，地尽其力。在推广新式农具、选用优良品种和技术改革方面更优越于富裕中农。
    几项措施
    根据全区不同的情况和上述特点，提出了几条赶上富裕中农生产的措施：
      一、兴修水利，变旱田为水田。必须集中力量解决水的问题，重点是农田水利，防涝防洪，水土保持，整治河道，排涝除渍。在山区除修谷坊、地埂、梯田、封山育林、养草护坡等水土保持措施外，还计划到1962年通过打井（机井、动力井、锥井、砖石井、透河井等）、开渠、发展渠道冬灌（可扩浇十五万亩）、修建小水库（一千零二十座）、建扬水站、利用水坑等措施，共扩大浇地面积三百三十一万亩。另外，利用滏阳河在冀衡千顷洼（冀县、衡水之间的大片洼地）蓄洪灌溉，变水害为水利，可浇地五十万亩。这样，全区灌溉面积可由原有的六百七十七万亩增加到一千多万亩（不包括千顷洼蓄洪灌溉）。如以地区划分，中部九县基本上消灭旱地；山区八县水地占耕地52.8％，每人可有水地一亩四；东部八县水地占耕地的43.7％，每人平均有水地一亩六分多。
    二、多积肥多养猪。除尽量增施细肥化学肥料外，增产基本上靠增加粗肥。粗肥的增加靠多养猪。全区现有猪一百零六万口（超过历史最高水平），平均每户点八一口，每十五点四亩耕地有一口猪，每亩平均施粗肥三千五百斤左右。计划到1962年猪发展到二百五十万口，平均一户两口，每六点五亩耕地有一口猪，每亩地平均施粗肥六千斤左右。同时大量发展耕畜、羊只。
    三、扩大复播面积，提高土地利用率，因地制宜地多种高产作物，普及优良品种，推广先进的农业技术。现在全区复种指数已由1953年的124.3％增加到139.8％。随着农田水利工作的开展，复播指数将逐年增大，到1962年增加到150％。
    全区现有高产作物共达四百二十六万亩，到1962年扩大到五百零五万亩。1962年前普及各种主要作物的良种。同时，以总结推广当地群众的先进经验为主，大力推广先进农业技术；实行精耕细作，颗粒还家。
    四、不同地区的增产措施：
    东部八县水地仅占耕地4％，还有碱地百万亩。这八个县耕作粗糙，产量很低，除抓紧旱田变水田外，主要抓：1、平整土地，把打的井用起来；2、改变耕作粗糙状况，改耧密植（把尺八耧改九寸耧，每亩即能增产十斤二十斤粮食），消灭缺苗断垅；3、改造碱地：打土埂多上肥；种耐碱作物（如种苜蓿、向日葵、扫帚、红荆等）；垫沙改良土壤，修台田，争取三、五年内把有条件改造的碱地改造过来。
    中部九县是水浇地，产量高，主要抓：1、种两季作物、间作、复播；2、合理密植；3、中部是棉区，棉花增产抓适时播种、旱期除虫、精细整枝三大环节。
    西部八县是山区和半山区，必须依靠农业社在全面地开展水土保持的前提下，扩大耕地面积，改良土壤，力争粮食自给；同时要因地制宜地发展林业、果树、畜牧、饲养以及多种多样的土特产。
    加强党的领导  保证规划实现
    为了保证规划的实现，必须加强党的领导，为此，特别要抓住下面三项重要工作：
    一、政治思想工作。政治思想工作是推动生产的动力，是实现计划的灵魂。因此，必须采用辩论的方式，结合实际情况，在群众中经常进行社会主义和资本主义两条道路的教育，以巩固和扩大社会主义思想阵地，使农民明确地树立勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家的思想，调动起一切积极因素，使党内外思想一致，行动统一，以保证计划的实现。
    二、赶上富裕中农和巩固农业社的规划，特别要抓住实现长远计划的年度计划。我们正在从地委到县、乡、社均制定三、五年内巩固农业社的规划。这个规划同赶上富裕中农的生产规划是密切相联的。有了这个规划，使农业社在民主办社、勤俭办社、生产管理、劳动组织、财务工作等方面，逐步走上正轨。这样，赶上富裕中农生产水平，就更有了保证。
    三、调查研究，解决新问题。农业合作化以后，农村新问题如雨后春笋，但很多干部却习惯于过去的一套领导方法，一部分干部满足于开会听汇报，在办公室出主意，布置工作时照搬上级指示，不能很好地结合本地的特点安排工作。这种状况不改变，赶上富裕中农生产水平和亩产四百斤粮食的规划都实现不了。改变这种状况的办法就是：地委、县委和政府负责干部亲自“挂帅”，搭配一定助手，有目的有计划地深入群众进行调查研究。这是克服主观主义和转变领导作风的重要问题。为此，我们已将水、肥、牲畜的问题，从上到下确定由党、政、社的负责人专管，以便把生产中的关键性问题钻研得深、解决得透。
