Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 28th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Shui Tiansheng, Feng Dongshu report): In September, the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi Province present a scene of harvest and prosperity everywhere. In the terraced fields, sturdy and fruitful crops are growing. The hillsides are covered with trees and grass. Farmers describe the current situation as: the hillsides are green, the harmful rivers have become beneficial rivers, the land is fertile, the yields are high, and people have hope.

Before liberation, the Taihang Mountains were extremely barren mountainous areas. After liberation, with the care and support of the People's Government, the farmers are transforming the face of nature with their perseverance and labor. Large-scale farmland water conservancy construction is gradually changing the situation of "nine droughts in ten years." After liberation, farmers found various ways to develop water conservancy. In a short period of a few years, fifteen counties in the Taihang Mountains area have built more than 1,000 small reservoirs and ponds, dug 130,000 drought wells, and excavated more than 8,500 channels. The waterlogged area in the region has increased from 40,000 mu before liberation to the current 960,000 mu. Before liberation, at least 40,000 to 50,000 mu of land in the Taihang Mountains were washed away by mountain floods every year. After liberation, farmers carried out large-scale soil and water conservation work. Up to now, the afforestation area for closing hills for afforestation and scattered tree planting in the region is more than 4.5 million mu. In addition to the construction of terraced fields, check dams, and dams, the area of soil erosion control has reached 10 million mu.

The fruitful rewards that the farmers in the Taihang Mountains have received for their labor in the struggle against nature are: the average yield per mu of grain has increased from 149 jin before liberation to the current 247 jin. The total income of each agricultural cooperative and the income of the members are increasing year by year. Bumper harvest

    改造大自然取得伟大成就
    太行山区欣欣向荣
    新华社太原28日电  新华社记者水天生、冯东书报道：9月的山西省太行山区，到处呈现着丰收和欣欣向荣的景象。在层层的梯田里，生长着结实累累的庄稼。山坡上覆盖着树木和青草。农民们形容现在的情况是：山坡绿化了，害河变成益河了，土地肥沃了，产量提高了，人们有奔头了。
    解放前，太行山是极为贫瘠的山区。解放以后，在人民政府的关怀和支持下，农民用坚毅的劳动改造着大自然的面貌。大规模的农田水利建设正在使“十年九旱”的状况逐渐改变。解放后，农民找到了多种发展水利的办法。在短短的几年中，太行山区十五个县共修建了一千多个小型水库和池塘，开凿了十三万眼旱井，开挖了八千五百多条渠道。全区的水地已经由解放前的四万亩增加到现在的九十六万亩。解放前，太行山区每年被山洪冲刷的土地至少有四、五万亩。解放后，农民进行了大规模的水土保持工作。到目前为止，全区封山育林和零星植树的绿化面积有四百五十多万亩，加上修梯田、筑谷坊、打坝等，控制水土流失面积已经达到一千万亩。
    太行山区农民在和大自然斗争中付出的劳动，已经得到的丰硕的报酬是：粮食的每亩平均产量由解放前的一百四十九斤增加到现在的二百四十七斤。各农业社的总收入和社员的收入都在逐年增加。丰收
