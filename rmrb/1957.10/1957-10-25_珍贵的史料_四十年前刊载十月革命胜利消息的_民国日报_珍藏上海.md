Precious Historical Material
Forty-Year-Old "Min Kuo Daily" Carrying News of October Revolution Victory Preserved in Shanghai

A newspaper that, forty years ago, was among the first in China to publish the news of the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in a prominent position is now preserved in the Xujiahui Library of the Shanghai Library.

This good news that opened a new era in human history was published on November 10, 1917, in the "Important News" section of the "Min Kuo Daily" published in Shanghai, with a striking headline. The news reported: "The Petrograd garrison and the labor society have overthrown the Kerensky government. The Meekzimel Party (i.e., the Soviet Communist Party) has occupied the capital (Petrograd). Mr. Rilin (Lenin) delivered a speech proposing three major issues of Russian civil administration: (1) immediately end the war, (2) return land to the peasants, and (3) resolve economic problems, which was greatly cheered by the audience."

On the second anniversary of the victory of the October Revolution, this newspaper continuously published many theoretical articles introducing the history of Russian social thought in its supplement "Awakening." In 1920, it published the Soviet Russian government's declaration to China, which conveyed the news of the victory of the October Revolution to the Chinese people, declared the abandonment of all privileges of the Tsarist era in China, and suggested the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. This declaration aroused extremely enthusiastic responses from the Chinese people towards the Soviet Union, and the newspaper also published congratulatory letters from various Chinese people's organizations to the Soviet Union.

At that time, Qu Qiubai, Deng Zhongxia and others from the Shanghai Marxist Research Society wrote manuscripts for the newspaper's supplement "Awakening" to spread Marxist-Leninist ideas. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

    珍贵的史料
    四十年前刊载十月革命胜利消息的“民国日报”珍藏上海
    四十年前我国最早以显著地位刊登伟大十月社会主义革命胜利消息的一份报纸，现在珍藏在上海图书馆徐家汇藏书楼的书库里。
    这个开辟人类历史新纪元的喜讯，在1917年11月10日以头条地位发表在上海出版的“民国日报”要闻版上，大字标题十分醒目，消息中报道：“彼得格勒戍军与劳动社会已推倒克伦斯基政府。美克齐美尔党（即苏联共产党）占据都城（彼得格勒）。里林（列宁）氏演说提出俄国民治三大问题（1）即行结束战局（2）以土地给还农民（3）解决经济问题，听者大为欢呼”。
    这家报纸在十月革命胜利两周年纪念时，又连续在副刊“觉悟”上，登载了不少介绍俄国社会思想史的理论文章。1920年又刊登了苏俄政府的对华宣言，宣言中向中国人民传达十月革命胜利的消息，声明放弃帝俄时代在华的一切特权，建议中俄建立邦交。这一宣言曾经引起中国人民对苏联极为热烈的响应，报上还登了中国各人民团体纷纷向苏联发出祝贺的复信。
    当时上海马克思主义研究会的瞿秋白、邓中夏等人，曾为这家报纸的副刊“觉悟”编写过稿件，传播马克思列宁主义思想。（新华社）（附图片）
