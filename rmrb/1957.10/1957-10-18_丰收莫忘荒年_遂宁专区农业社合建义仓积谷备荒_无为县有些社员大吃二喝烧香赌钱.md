　　Don't Forget Famine in Years of Good Harvest
    Suining Special District Agricultural Cooperatives Jointly Build Charity Granaries to Store Grain for Famine Relief
    Some Commune Members in Wuwei County Overeat, Overdrink, Burn Incense, and Gamble
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch. Agricultural cooperatives in Suining Special District, Sichuan Province, are jointly establishing "charity granaries" at the township level, saving a certain amount of grain during bumper harvest years for use in famine years. The preparatory work for Qianjin Township in Tongnan County, which started earlier, is already complete. The "charity granaries" have been established, and all 42,549 catties of grain voluntarily contributed by commune members have been stored. It has been decided that the "charity granaries" in other townships of the special district will also be completed in October.
    "Accumulating grain to prevent hunger" is a good tradition inherent to the farmers here. When the initiative to establish "charity granaries" was proposed, it was widely welcomed by the farmers. When farmers in the Sixth Village of Xinde Township, Santai County, discussed the establishment of "charity granaries," the 84 people present immediately volunteered to save 1,051 catties of grain throughout the year to put into the "charity granaries."
    Suining Special District has increased production year after year in the past, and the amount of grain retained by farmers has continuously increased. According to relevant departments' investigations, it is entirely possible for each person to save five catties of grain per year. On September 20, the Suining Commissioner's Office issued instructions requiring administrative departments at all levels to assist agricultural cooperatives in doing a good job in "charity granaries."
    This newspaper reports: Wuwei County, Anhui Province, had an overall bumper harvest of early rice and mid-season rice this year, with an average yield of 390 catties per mu, an increase of more than double that of last year (most rice suffered disaster and reduced production last year), and the mid-season rice was also a bumper harvest. Some commune members have developed the idea of ​​overeating, overspending, and extravagant spending. For example, after the early rice harvest, 14 commune members of the Shazhuang team of the Patriotic Brigade of the Xinmin District Machang Agricultural Cooperative went to restaurants twice in a row, spending 28 yuan and getting drunk; Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Dougou District bought 16 watches, 31 sets of silk clothing, and 105 catties of wool, worth more than 4,700 yuan.
    The atmosphere of performing operas, burning incense, and gambling is also very prevalent. Four agricultural cooperatives in Zhaoba Township, Dougou District, burned incense continuously for more than ten days, spending more than 1,600 yuan on incense and candles. The first and second production teams of the United Agricultural Cooperative in this township spent more than 400 yuan on performing "peaceful operas" for six days because of the bumper harvest. Burning incense and performing operas not only wasted money, but more seriously affected production, because performing operas and burning incense are precisely during the busy harvest season. To watch the opera, many commune members would rather give up production. For example, 500 mu of mature early rice in the United Cooperative was left unharvested, resulting in shedding, germination, and falling to the ground. Some farmers in Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative gathered to gamble, with wins and losses reaching four to five thousand yuan.
    After discovering the above situation, the Wuwei County Committee of the Communist Party of China has begun to carry out ideological education among farmers on running cooperatives and managing households diligently and thriftily.

　　丰收莫忘荒年
    遂宁专区农业社合建义仓积谷备荒
    无为县有些社员大吃二喝烧香赌钱
    新华社成都电　四川省遂宁专区的农业社以乡为单位联合建立“义仓”，在丰收年节约一定的粮食储存起来，以备灾荒年需用。筹备工作进行较早的潼南县前进乡，“义仓”已经建立起来，社员们自愿拿出的四万二千五百四十九斤粮食已经全部入仓。专区其他各乡的“义仓”也都决定在10月份内建成。
    “积谷防饥”是这里农民固有的优良传统，当建立“义仓”的倡议提出后，受到农民的普遍欢迎。三台县新德乡第六村农民在讨论建立“义仓”时，到会的八十四人当场自报全年能节约出粮食一千零五十一斤放到“义仓”。
    遂宁专区过去连年增产，农民留粮数量不断增加，据有关部门调查，每人一年节约五斤粮食是完全可能的。遂宁专员公署在9月20日发出指示，要求各级行政部门协助农业社做好“义仓”的工作。
    本报讯　安徽省无为县今年早稻中稻全面丰收，每亩平均产三百九十斤，比去年增产一倍多（去年大部水稻受灾减产），中稻也丰收。部分社员产生了大吃大喝大手花钱的思想。如新民区马厂农业社爱国大队沙庄小队十四个社员在早稻收割后，连续两次下饭馆，花掉二十八元，喝得熏熏大醉；陡沟区新华农业社买了十六只手表，纺绸衣服三十一套，毛线一百零五斤，总值四千七百多元。
    唱戏、烧香、赌博的风气也很盛。陡沟区赵坝乡四个农业社连续烧香十几天，共花去香烛钱一千六百多元。这个乡的联合农业社第一二两个生产大队，因为丰收唱了六天“平安戏”，共花掉四百多元。烧香唱戏不但浪费了金钱，更严重的是影响了生产，因为唱戏和烧香正是农忙的收获季节。为了看戏，许多社员宁愿放弃了生产。像联合社五百亩成熟的早稻无人收割，以致脱粒落地发芽。新华农业社有些农民聚赌，输赢达到四五千元。
    中共无为县委发现上述情况后，已开始对农民进行勤俭办社勤俭持家的思想教育。
