    Removing Concerns from Various Parties and Encouraging Free Airing of Views
    Training Backbone Teams to Launch Debates
    Trial Experience of the Socialist Education Movement in the Jingyang Iron and Steel Agricultural Cooperative
    Our correspondent from Xi'an, October 27th: Shaanxi Province's rural rectification movement is in the pilot stage. Currently, key trials are being conducted in 224 agricultural cooperatives across the province. The ongoing Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting has summarized the initial experiences of these key trials. At present, various regions of the province are engaged in an intense fight against drought, and the province-wide rural rectification movement will be launched successively starting in December.
    The trial experience of the rectification movement in the Jingyang County Iron and Steel Agricultural Production Cooperative was presented as a model at the Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting. The work plan for the cooperative's rectification trial is divided into five stages: 1. Approximately seven days to eliminate concerns, conduct investigations and research, and encourage free airing of views; 2. Approximately ten days to promote democracy and engage in extensive airing of views; 3. Approximately twenty days to train backbone teams and launch debates; 4. Preparing to spend twenty days improving the work of the cooperative and further carrying out Party and League rectification ideologically and organizationally; 5. Five to seven days to summarize the work and consolidate the achievements of the rectification. Started on August 30th, and by October 15th, it had reached the late stage of the third phase.
    At the beginning of the rectification, the cadres and masses of the cooperative had great ideological concerns, particularly a vague understanding of how to distinguish and handle contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and contradictions among the people. After the work team arrived at the cooperative and discovered this situation, they went deep into the fields to help the masses with production, while using this opportunity to propagate policies and understand the situation. At the same time, they interspersed talks, small meetings, and large meetings, explaining the policies of the rectification to the cooperative's cadres and Party and League members, as well as holding special small meetings for the elderly, youth, women, well-to-do middle peasants, and landlords and rich peasants. Furthermore, based on the opinions initially expressed by the masses, each village improved several aspects of the current work that could be improved, such as publishing accounts, investigating corruption, distributing leftover wheat stalks and bean vines, and improving the work of livestock breeding rooms. In this way, the work team gained preliminary prestige among the masses, and the cooperative's cadres and masses gained a preliminary understanding of the purpose of the rectification, and concerns were preliminarily eliminated, beginning with small-scale airing of views. During this stage, the work team also paid attention to leveraging the enthusiasm of the cadres and uniting a group of reliable activists.
    During the extensive airing of views, the work team grasped the pattern of the masses first addressing distant matters before closer ones, first addressing positive aspects before negative ones, and first discussing general issues before major issues, guiding the extensive airing of views to advance in a wave-like manner from shallow to deep. The masses believed that this "first tore off the mask," which made them increasingly bold in voicing their opinions. The cooperative's cadres, Party and League members, and masses aired their views together, playing a decisive role in forming the extensive airing of views. The cooperative's cadres also temporarily refrained from explaining or refuting criticisms made by the masses to superiors, so as not to dampen the masses' enthusiasm for airing their views.
    In the process of airing views, the cooperative continued to pay attention to eliminating the masses' concerns about airing their views, and paid special attention to the concerns of cadres' families. The wife of one team leader, after seeing her husband criticized by the masses, said to her husband: "You work day and night without regard for yourself, and now people are still targeting you. If they take you to court, you must first settle me and the children." Later, a special meeting of family members was held to eliminate such concerns.
    The cooperative also paid attention to preventing backward elements from secretly stoking the flames during the airing of views. Because the ideological struggle in the hearts of the masses was very intense during the airing of views, some people thought back and forth before and after airing their views, feeling very uneasy. Some backward elements said things like "They are just tricking a blind dog into biting a stone lion," "They are just making a fool jump off a cliff, see how you can take it back after you say it," "Mind your own business, ask for trouble, you'll offend people for nothing and it won't do any good," and so on. The work team paid timely attention to these rumors and held meetings with the most concerned elderly and backward elements to explain the situation, which stabilized the masses' emotions.
    After various forms of small-scale and extensive airing of views, the Iron and Steel Cooperative raised a total of 2,728 opinions, including 945 related to the cooperative's operation and management, 687 related to the work style of the cooperative's cadres, and 508 related to national policies and guidelines. Work team cadres helped each team and the cooperative's rectification committee study all the opinions, classify them, and propose solutions.
    After the extensive airing of views, the cooperative decided to first select some major issues of principle related to socialism for extensive debate. In order to prepare for the extensive debate, the cooperative's rectification committee, with the help of the work team, focused on training backbone forces and organizing them to conduct extensive debates first. These debates started small and gradually grew larger, first convening meetings of highly conscious Party and League members to unify their understanding, and then absorbing a small number of poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in the meetings. In this way, a batch was trained, a batch was absorbed, new and old were interspersed, and the old led the new, gradually expanding the backbone forces.
    The main method of training backbone forces was to gradually improve their class consciousness through recollection, comparison, accounting, and reasoning, so that they could draw a clear line between socialism and capitalism. In the debate, they were also guided to link the criticism with their own selfish psychology and muddled thinking, relieve themselves of their ideological burdens, and then enter the battle with confidence.
    After training the backbone forces, the cooperative launched an extensive debate on major issues of principle related to socialism, and specifically named and debated with well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas. During the debate, the cooperative continued to help the backbone forces research and analyze erroneous viewpoints and collect factual basis for refutation. During the debate, it was necessary to organize well, divide labor for speeches, support each other, and supplement each other, so that the debate object would be at a loss for words.
    In the debate, the cooperative conducted debates and criticisms against 29 well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas, one newly well-to-do middle peasant, and two former small landlords. Struggle education was carried out against two hooligan loafers. Unveiling and liquidation were carried out against three corrupt elements. Debates were also conducted against ten new lower-middle peasants with forgetting-the-root thoughts. Now, the cooperative is conducting a reasoned struggle against several landlord elements with serious destructive activities. After this reasoned struggle is completed, the stage mainly focused on extensive airing of views and extensive debates will be concluded, and the stage mainly focused on rectifying work style and improving work will be entered.

    多方解除顾虑启发鸣放
    训练骨干队伍展开辩论
    泾阳钢铁农业社社会主义教育运动试办经验
    本报西安27日电　陕西省的农村整风运动正在试点阶段。目前全省在二百二十四个农业合作社进行重点试办，正在进行的省委扩大会议总结了这些重点试办的初步经验。目前该省各地正在进行紧张的抗旱斗争，全省农村的整风运动将从12月份起陆续开展。
    泾阳县钢铁农业生产合作社的整风运动试办的经验，在省委扩大会议上作了典型介绍。这个社的整风试办工作计划共分五个阶段：一、约用七天时间，消除顾虑，调查研究，启发鸣放；二、约用十天时间，发扬民主，大鸣大放；三、约用二十天时间，训练骨干队伍，开展辩论；四、准备用二十天时间，改进社的工作，并进一步从思想上和组织上进行整党、整团；五、用五天到七天时间总结工作、巩固整风成果。从8月30日开始，到10月15日，已进行到第三个阶段的后期。
    整风开始，该社干部和群众思想顾虑很大，特别是对如何分别认识和处理敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾模糊不清。工作组到该社发现这一情况后，就深入田间，帮助群众生产，从中宣传政策，了解情况，同时穿插谈话、小会和大会，向社干部和党团员积极分子讲解整风的政策，还专门召开了老年、青年、妇女、富裕中农、地富分子等小型会议。而且根据群众初步反映的意见，各村都改进了几项目前能够改进的工作，如公布账目，查清贪污账，分配剩余的麦秸和豆蔓，改善牲畜饲养室的工作等。这样，工作组就在群众中有了初步的威信，社干部和群众对整风的目的有了初步了解，顾虑初步消除，开始了小鸣小放。工作组在这一阶段，还注意发挥干部的积极性和团结了一批可靠的积极分子。
    在大鸣大放时，工作组掌握群众先远后近，先正面后反面，先谈一般问题后谈重大问题的规律，因势利导，使大鸣大放由浅而深地波浪式地前进。群众认为，这样“先撕开了面皮”，就越来越放开胆子提出意见。这个社的干部、党团员和群众一起齐鸣齐放，对形成大鸣大放起了决定性的作用。社干部向上级提出批评，也暂时不作说明和辩驳，以免给群众鸣放热情泼冷水。
    在鸣放过程中，该社继续注意消除群众鸣放的顾虑，对于干部家属的顾虑也予以特别注意。有一个队长的女人看见丈夫受到群众批评后，对丈夫说：“你黑不顾黑，明不顾明地工作，现在人家还整你，要是把你弄去坐法院，你先把我和娃娃安顿好。”以后，就专门召开了家属会议，才消除了这样的顾虑。
    该社在鸣放中还注意防止落后分子暗地抽火。因为在鸣放中群众内心里的思想斗争是很激烈的，有人在鸣放前后思前想后，很不放心。有些落后分子说什么“人家哄瞎狗咬石狮哩”，“人家日弄傻娃跳崖哩，看你说了怎样收得回来”，“管闲事，惹闲气，白得罪人不顶事”等等。工作组及时注意了这些流言，还召开了顾虑最多的老人和落后分子开会，进行了解释，对群众情绪起了稳定作用。
    钢铁社经过各种形式的小鸣小放和大鸣大放后，一共提出意见二千七百二十八条，其中属于社的经营管理的九百四十五条，社干部作风的六百八十七条，有关国家政策方针的五百零八条。工作组干部帮助各队和社的整改委员会把所有意见作了研究，分类排队，提出处理意见。
    在大鸣大放以后，该社决定先选出一些有关社会主义大是大非的问题进行大争大辩。为了作好大争大辩，该社整改委员会在工作组的帮助下，着重训练了骨干力量并组织他们先进行大争大辩。这种争辩会先由小到大，先召集觉悟高的党团员会，统一他们的认识，再吸收少数贫农和下中农参加会议。这样训练一批，吸收一批，新旧穿插，以旧带新，逐步扩大了骨干队伍。
    训练骨干队伍的方法，主要是通过回忆、对比、算账、辩理，逐渐提高他们的阶级觉悟，使他们划清社会主义和资本主义的是非界限。在辩论中，并引导他们联系批判自己的自私心理和糊涂思想，解除他们自己的思想包袱，然后理直气壮地投入战斗。
    该社在骨干队伍训练以后，就展开对社会主义大是大非的大辩论，而且指名和资本主义思想严重的富裕中农开展辩论。该社在辩论中，继续帮助骨干力量研究分析错误观点、搜集批驳的事实根据。辩论时，要很好组织，分工发言，互相支援、互相补充，使辩论对象理屈词穷。
    在辩论中，该社对资本主义思想严重的二十九个富裕中农、一个新富裕中农、两个原来的小土地出租者进行了辩论批判。对两个流氓二流子进行了斗争教育。对三个贪污分子进行了揭发和清算。对十个有忘本思想的新下中农也进行了辩论。现在，该社正对几个有严重破坏活动的地主分子进行说理斗争。这一说理斗争完毕后，就结束大鸣大放大争为主的阶段，转入以整顿作风改进工作为主的阶段。
