    Great March to the Beach, 1,000 Jin Per Mu
    Zhao Yonglan, Deputy Head of the Youth Reclamation Team of the Beidagang Mutual Aid Agricultural Cooperative, Huanghua County
    I joined the Beidagang Youth Voluntary Reclamation Team in 1956 in response to the call from higher authorities. At that time, I was only an eighteen-year-old girl. I grew up in a warm family, left school at the age of sixteen, participated in agricultural production, and served as a teacher in a village school. During a year of labor and production, the Party and Youth League branches continuously cultivated and educated me, which improved my ideological awareness and developed a strong interest in agricultural production. In the winter of 1955, my village, like rural areas across the country, achieved agricultural collectivization. In order to transform nature and increase production, the Party put forward the call to "March on the Wasteland" and organized the Beidagang Youth Reclamation Team. I realized that reclaiming wasteland was supporting national economic construction and creating a happy and beautiful future. I was determined to be a strong fighter on the agricultural front and actively signed up. However, the elders in my family were afraid that I would not be able to endure hardship and thought that it was ridiculous for a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl to go to the wilderness to reclaim land. So they tried to stop me in every way. But because I was firm in my thinking, I finally patiently persuaded my parents. At the beginning of the lunar year, I left my hometown and arrived at the Bohai beach, which had been called the "bitter sea" for thousands of years, and began the great march to the barren alkaline land with my comrades.
    At that time, we lived in newly built thatched sheds, and the climate was the coldest time of the year. The north wind kept blowing, and the Bohai beach was very cold. It snowed heavily for days, and the wind and snow made it impossible to fall asleep. At this time, some young people's thoughts wavered and their confidence was insufficient, especially some women, who had never suffered such hardships, cried and made a fuss, wanting to go home. I also hesitated because I underestimated the difficulties. At this time, the Party branch constantly encouraged and helped me. I realized that I was a member of the Communist Youth League and the leader of the women's team, with a heavy responsibility. In this difficult situation, I should not bow to difficulties. I carried out socialist ideological education among the team members, inspired the enthusiasm of all members, and stabilized everyone's emotions. In order to transplant rice seedlings in time and benefit that year, we started field construction immediately after arriving at the wasteland. The arduous labor began. In late winter and early spring, the ground was frozen and unthawed, and the terrain was low-lying. Frozen blocks sealed the ground, and we had to take off our shoes and socks and go into the water to dig ditches. Some female team members were afraid of being ridiculed by men and refused to go into the water barefoot. For example, Ma Yuxiu said, "I can't work in the water, it's too embarrassing to be barefoot!" Some young men sarcastically said, "Women can't do it, and they still talk about equality between men and women!" I thought, if men can do it, why can't we women do it? I must be determined to overcome this difficulty! I was the first to take off my shoes and socks, jump into the water barefoot, and carry baskets of mud with the men. The cold wind cracked my legs, the iron shovel broke my hands, and the wooden pole swelled my shoulders, but I was not intimidated by these difficulties and persisted for forty days without ever being absent once. Under the education of the Party and the Youth League, the thinking of the team members also improved, and all 28 women in the team went into the water. We launched a friendship competition, such as Gao Yu'e, who refused to rest even when her legs were swollen. In this way, we smoothly completed the field construction of 960 mu of paddy fields in the whole team, ensuring timely washing of alkali and timely transplanting of rice seedlings. At the autumn harvest, the average yield per mu reached 600 jin.
    From the first day of reclamation, I deeply realized that humbly learning is the guarantee for the smooth completion of the task. After the project started, we mobilized women and men to sign contracts for guaranteed teaching and learning. Thanks to the patient help of my comrades and my own hard work, I have learned soil work techniques such as picking ditches, washing slopes, pumping bottoms, leveling, and tamping, and I have also learned the complete set of techniques for planting rice, from knowing to being proficient, from being an amateur to being an expert. Last year, I worked a total of 130 workdays and earned 270 yuan. Last October, I was selected as a representative to attend the provincial women's activists conference and received a certificate and a medal.
    This year, our cooperative has organized another youth team, and I have been elected as the deputy head of the youth team again. The cooperative allocated 364 mu of land to us, of which 300 mu are all barren alkaline land. The 26 team members averaged 14 mu per person (other teams averaged 10 mu per person). At that time, some young people's thinking was not clear. They thought that reclaiming wasteland last year was very tiring, and they should plant cultivated land this year. I patiently explained to them that we young people should not be afraid of hardship, but overcome difficulties, which inspired the enthusiasm of the team members. In order to respond to the call from higher authorities of "transplanting one day earlier, maturing ten days earlier," all team members went out early and returned late, rain or shine. The 364 mu of land was universally dug with iron shovels in 27 days, and more than 3,000 cubic meters of earthwork (24 capillary canals and 1 bucket canal) were completed in 12 days, and early rice was planted in time. After a series of technical management, the rice is now mature. Although it is newly opened paddy field, the estimated yield per mu can reach 1,000 jin. After deducting all expenses, each person can get about 1,000 yuan, about 300 yuan more than the average team. The large increase in income has strengthened everyone's determination to fight against nature. Two years of reclamation have made me fully realize that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and relying on the strength of the collective can the coastal wasteland that has existed for thousands of years be turned over and grow grain. But this is only the beginning. We must not be arrogant and complacent, but must humbly learn, constantly improve ourselves, and dedicate our youth and wisdom to the great motherland, and strive to build a beautiful new countryside.

    海滩大进军，每亩产千斤
    黄骅县北大港互助农业社青年垦荒队副队长
    赵永兰
    我是1956年响应上级号召，参加北大港青年自愿垦荒队的。当时我仅是一个十八岁的女孩子。我生长在一个温暖的家庭里，十六岁上离开了学校，参加农业生产，并在本村担任了民校教师。在一年的劳动生产中，党、团支部不断地培养和教育我，使我提高了思想觉悟，对农业生产有了浓厚兴趣。1955年冬，我村也和全国农村一样，实现了农业合作化。为了改造自然，增加生产，党提出了“向荒地大进军”的号召，组织了北大港青年垦荒队。我认识到，垦荒就是支援国家经济建设，也是为了创造幸福美好的将来，我下定决心要做一个农业战线上的坚强战士，便积极地报了名。但是家里老人怕我受不了苦，并且认为，十七、八岁的大姑娘到荒野去开荒不是胡闹吗？于是百般地阻挠我。但由于我的思想坚定，终于耐心的说服了父母，于阴历年初，离开了自己的故乡，到达了几千年来被称为苦海沿边的渤海滩上，和同志们一起，开始向荒碱地大进军。
    当时我们住的是刚搭起不久的草铺，而气候又是数九寒天，北风不断吹来，渤海滩上非常寒冷；连日下大雪，风雪交加，使人不能入睡。这时有些青年思想动摇，信心不足，特别是有的妇女，从来未受过这样的艰苦，便大哭大闹，要回家。我也由于对困难估计不足，思想犹豫起来。这时党支部不断地鼓励我帮助我，我认识到自己是个共青团员，又是妇女队长，责任重大，在这困难的情况下，不应向困难低头。我在队员中进行了社会主义的思想教育，启发了全体社员的积极性，稳定了大家的情绪。为了及时插秧，争取当年受益，到达荒滩后，紧接着便进行田间工程。艰苦的劳动开始了。冬末春初，地冻未化，加上地势低洼，冻块封住地面，必须脱去鞋袜到水中进行挖渠。有的女队员怕男子讥笑，不肯光脚下水。如马玉秀说：“俺下水干不了，光着脚多难看呀！”有的青年男子讽刺说：“妇女干不了，还说男女平等呢！”我想，男子能干的活，为什么我们妇女就不能干呢？我要下定决心克服这个困难！我第一个脱去鞋袜，赤脚跳到水中，和男子一齐抬筐挖泥。寒风吹裂了我的腿，铁锨磨破了我的手，木杠压肿了我的肩，但是我并没有被这些困难吓倒，一直坚持了四十天，从未缺勤一次。在党、团的教育下，队员们的思想也提高了，全队二十八名妇女都下了水。我们开展了友谊竞赛，如高玉娥腿肿了也不肯休息。这样，便顺利地完成了全队九百六十亩稻田的田间工程，保证了及时洗碱，适时插秧。秋收时，每亩平均产量达到六百斤。
    从垦荒的头一天起，我就深深体会到虚心学习，是顺利完成任务的保证。在工程开始后，发动妇女和男子订立了保教保学的合同。由于同志们的耐心帮助和自己苦心学习，我已经学会了挑沟、洗坡、抽底、取平、打夯等土工技术，同时也学会了种植水稻的全套技术，由会到熟，由外行变内行。去年一年我共做了劳动日一百三十个，收入二百七十元。去年10月，我被选为出席省的妇女积极分子大会的代表，获得了奖状和奖章。
    今年我社又组织了青年队，我又被选为青年队的副队长。社内拨给我们三百六十四亩地，其中有三百亩尽是荒碱地。全队二十六个队员每人平均十四亩（其他队每人平均十亩）。当时有些青年思想不通，认为去年开荒受累很大，今年应种熟地，我便耐心地向他们说明，我们青年不应怕艰苦，而要战胜困难，启发了队员的积极性。为了响应上级提出的“早插一天、早熟十天”的号召，全体队员都是早去晚归，风雨不停，三百六十四亩地二十七天便用铁锨普掘了一遍，十二天完成了三千多公方的土方工程（毛渠二十四条、斗渠一条），及时种上了早稻。经过一系列的技术管理，现在稻子已经成熟，虽然是新开的稻田，每亩估产能达一千斤，除一切消费外每人可分得款一千元左右，比一般队可多分三百元左右。收入的大量增加，更加强了大家向自然斗争的决心。二年来的垦荒，使我充分的认识到，只有在共产党的领导下，依靠集体的力量，才能使几千年的沿海荒滩翻了身，长了粮食。但这仅仅是一个开始，我们决不骄傲自满，更要虚心的学习，不断地提高自己，把我们的青春和智慧贡献给伟大的祖国，为建设美好的新农村而奋斗。
