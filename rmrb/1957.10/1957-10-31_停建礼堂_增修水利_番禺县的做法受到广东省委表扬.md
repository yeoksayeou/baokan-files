Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a circular commending Panyu County's spirit of compressing non-productive expenditures, increasing investment in water conservancy construction, and conscientiously improving work.
    The Panyu County Party Committee originally allocated a sum of money from local financial revenue to build a large auditorium. On the evening of October 18th, after hearing the Provincial Party Committee's criticism of similar behavior, it convened an emergency meeting on the morning of the 19th and decided to halt the auditorium construction project and use the construction funds for production instead. At the same time, it was decided to increase the original water conservancy investment from 85,000 yuan to 105,000 yuan. It also notified all districts and townships to suspend all non-productive capital construction and concentrate financial resources on water conservancy construction and production construction.
    In the circular, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee hoped that Party committees at all levels would emulate Panyu County's practices, immediately conduct inspections, correct non-productive viewpoints, and concentrate all available funds on production.

    停建礼堂　增修水利
    番禺县的做法受到广东省委表扬
    本报广州电　中共广东省委最近发出通报，表扬番禺县压缩非生产性开支，增加水利建设投资和认真改进工作的精神。
    番禺县委原来从地方财政收入中，拨出一笔款项修建大礼堂。10月18日晚上，听了省委对类似行为的批评，遂于19日上午召开紧急会议，决定把修建礼堂的工程停下来，并将这项建设款项用到生产中去。同时，决定把原来的水利投资八万五千元增加到十万五千元。还通报各区乡停办一切非生产性的基本建设，集中财力于水利建设和生产建设。
    广东省委在通报中希望各级党委仿照番禺县的做法，立即进行检查，纠正非生产性观点，集中一切可利用的资金到生产中去。
