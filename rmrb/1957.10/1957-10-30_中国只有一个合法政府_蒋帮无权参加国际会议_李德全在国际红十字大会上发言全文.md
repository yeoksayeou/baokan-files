Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 29th: At the plenary session of the International Red Cross Conference this morning, Li Dequan, on behalf of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Delegation of the Red Cross Society of China, delivered the following full text of her speech: Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates:

　　The Chinese delegation raised an urgent motion at yesterday's plenary session, opposing the conspiracy of certain individuals to create "two Chinas" by using the conference, and requesting the conference to take measures to prevent elements of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan from participating in the conference under any name. In order to show respect for the opinion of our conference chairman, we did not finish our speech. However, Mr. François-Poncet took advantage of his position to vigorously promote the theory of "two Chinas." Although he repeatedly emphasized that the International Red Cross Organization should "stay out of politics," most of his report talked about China's internal affairs, attempting to create a situation of "two Chinas" at our conference. Everyone knows that certain forces hostile to China, led by the United States, have recently been actively engaged in conspiracies to create "two Chinas." Mr. François-Poncet's activities are part of these U.S. conspiracies.

　　Everyone knows that the People's Republic of China is a signatory to the Geneva Conventions, the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing China, and the Red Cross Society of China is the only national Chinese Red Cross organization recognized by the People's Republic of China and is a member of the Red Cross Society Association. Therefore, only the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Delegation of the Red Cross Society of China have the right to attend this conference as China's only legitimate representatives. Taiwan is a province of China, and the authorities that exercise jurisdiction there can only be regarded as one of the local authorities of the People's Republic of China, and they have no representative power in diplomatic relations. The Red Cross organization there can only be a local organization of the Red Cross Society of China, and therefore it is not qualified to attend this conference. Anyone with a little common sense can understand this, and according to Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the International Red Cross Charter, only signatories to the Geneva Conventions have the right to send delegations, and each country can only have one government delegation. According to Article 2 of the "Conditions for Recognizing National Red Cross Societies," each country can only have one Red Cross Society with central authority. It is clear that if the invitation issued to elements of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan to attend the conference is not a deliberate attempt to split China and interfere in China's internal affairs, then what is it?

　　Mr. François-Poncet said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is a signatory to the Geneva Conventions. This statement is particularly absurd. The People's Republic of China was established because the Chinese people overthrew the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek. It replaced the entire old China (including Taiwan). This is entirely in accordance with the basic principles of international law. Governments often change in countries around the world. A new regime naturally replaces the old regime. What right do the personnel of the past regime, who have completely lost all qualifications to be representatives, have to participate in international conferences? Mr. François-Poncet, who was once a diplomat, should understand this basic common sense of international law.

　　Secondly, it is also absurd and ridiculous to compare the relationship between the Chinese government and its Taiwan province with the relationship between East Germany and West Germany, North Korea and South Korea, and North Vietnam and South Vietnam. Everyone knows that the current situation of East Germany and West Germany, as well as North Korea and South Korea, is due to the Second World War, and the temporary division of North Vietnam and South Vietnam is recognized by the Geneva Accords. Taiwan is different from the situation of these countries. It was returned to China after the end of World War II and has in fact become part of China. The Taiwan issue does not fall within the scope of unresolved international issues left over from World War II. These are recent historical facts. Those who confuse China's internal affairs with the divided situations of Germany, Korea, and Vietnam are either forgetful or have ulterior motives.

　　Third, the so-called Taiwan issue is essentially China's internal affair, and no foreign country or international organization may interfere. Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and the current abnormal situation is only the result of the U.S. armed aggression and occupation of Taiwan. However, the will of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan is unshakable. Taiwan must be liberated sooner or later. Any action that allows it to participate in international conferences as an independent government under the pretext of the so-called "Taiwan government" actually exercising power and implementing the Geneva Conventions is an action supporting U.S. aggression.

　　The United States is directing Mr. François-Poncet behind the scenes to abuse his position by telegraphing the so-called "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China," calling on the Chiang Kai-shek clique to participate in this conference. Such an action is not only an insult to China's national dignity and an interference in China's internal affairs, but also an action aimed at undermining this conference.

　　In view of the above facts, the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Delegation of the Red Cross Society of China once again put forward the following demands to the conference:

　　The conference condemns the illegal actions of Mr. François-Poncet and his behind-the-scenes directors and immediately takes effective measures to prevent elements of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from participating in the conference under any name.

### 中国只有一个合法政府  蒋帮无权参加国际会议——李德全在国际红十字大会上发言全文

    中国只有一个合法政府蒋
    帮无权参加国际会议
    ——李德全在国际红十字大会上发言全文
    新华社新德里29日电　在国际红十字大会今天上午的全体会议上，李德全代表中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团的发言全文如下：主席阁下，各位代表：
    中国代表团在昨天的全体会议上提出了紧急动议，反对某些人利用会议制造“两个中国”的阴谋，并且要求会议采取措施制止台湾蒋介石集团分子以任何名义参加会议。为了表示尊重我们的会议主席的意见，我们没有作完我们的发言。但是弗朗索瓦—庞赛先生却利用他的地位大肆宣传“两个中国”的理论。虽然他一再强调国际红十字组织应当“置身于政治之外”，但是他的报告的大部分谈的却是中国的内政，企图在我们的会议上制造“两个中国”的局面。人人知道，以美国为首的敌视中国的某些势力最近正在积极进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋。弗朗索瓦—庞赛先生的活动就是美国的这些阴谋活动的一部分。
    人人知道，中华人民共和国是日内瓦公约的签字国，中华人民共和国政府是代表中国的唯一合法的政府，中国红十字会是中华人民共和国承认的唯一全国性的中国红十字会组织，而且是红十字会协会的会员。因此，只有中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团才有权作为中国唯一合法的代表出席这个会议。台湾是中国的一个省份，在那里行使管辖权的当局，只能被认为是中华人民共和国的地方当局之一，在外交关系上它没有任何代表权。那里的红十字组织也只能是中国红十字会的一个地方组织，因此也没有任何资格可以出席这个会议。只要有一点常识的人都能理解这一点，而且根据国际红十字章程第一条第二款规定，只有日内瓦公约的签字国才有权派遣代表团，而且每个国家只能有一个政府代表团。根据“承认各国红十字会的条件”的第二款的规定，每个国家只可以有一个拥有中央权力的红十字会。由此可见，如果说给台湾蒋介石集团分子发出的出席会议的邀请不是故意要分裂中国和干涉中国的内政，那又是什么呢？
    弗朗索瓦—庞赛先生说，蒋介石集团是日内瓦公约的一个签字国。这种说法尤其荒谬绝伦。中华人民共和国是由于中国人民推翻了蒋介石的反动统治而建立起来的。它取代了整个旧中国（其中包括台湾）。这是完全符合国际法的基本原则的。世界各国常常发生政府变动的事。一个新的政权自然取旧政权而代之。那些完全丧失了当代表的一切资格的过去政权的人员有什么权利参加国际会议呢？曾经身为外交官的弗朗索瓦—庞赛先生，是应当懂得这种基本的国际法常识的。
    其次，把中国政府和它的台湾省之间的关系同东德和西德、北朝鲜和南朝鲜、北越和南越之间的关系相提并论，也是荒谬可笑的。人人都知道，东德和西德以及北朝鲜和南朝鲜目前的状况是由于第二次世界大战而产生的，北越和南越的暂时分治是日内瓦协定所承认的。台湾同这些国家的情况不同，它在第二次世界大战结束后已经归还中国，而且已经在事实上成为中国的一部分。台湾问题并不属于第二次世界大战遗留下来的未解决的国际问题的范围。这些都是最近的历史事实。那些把中国的内政问题同德国、朝鲜和越南的分治状况混为一谈的人，不是健忘就一定是抱有不可告人的动机。
    第三，所谓台湾问题实质上是中国的内政问题，任何外国或国际组织都不得加以干涉。台湾是中国领土的一个不可分割的部分，目前的不正常状况只是美国对台湾的武装侵略和占领的结果。但是，中国人民解放台湾的意志是不可动摇的。台湾迟早一定要解放。以什么所谓“台湾政府”在那里实际行使权力和执行日内瓦公约为借口而让它作为一个独立政府参加国际会议的任何行动，都是支持美国侵略的行动。
    美国在幕后指使弗朗索瓦—庞赛先生滥用他的职位拍电报给所谓“中华民国外交部”，叫蒋介石集团参加这次会议。这样的行动不仅是对中国的民族尊严的侮辱和对中国内政的干涉，而且也是目的在于破坏这次会议的行动。
    鉴于上述事实，中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团再次向会议提出下述要求：
    会议谴责弗朗索瓦—庞赛先生和他的幕后指使者的非法行动，并且立即采取有效措施不准蒋介石集团分子以任何名义参加会议。
