    Promptly Guide Socialist Enthusiasm to Production
    Xiong Huo Cooperative Turns to Production and Construction Debate
    Discussing the Agricultural Program and Formulating Long-Term Plans; Cooperative Members' Morale is High, and Affluent Middle Peasants are Also Becoming Active
    Our newspaper, Hong Zhao, 29th Dispatch: After obtaining an "ideological harvest" from the socialist debate, the Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative in Hong Zhao County, Shanxi Province, has transitioned into a production and construction debate.
    During the previous stage, this agricultural cooperative underwent repeated ideological debates regarding the two paths, and capitalist ideas were powerfully criticized. The people's enthusiasm for taking the socialist road was clearly reflected in the increased sale of surplus grain, the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and the free discussions in the streets and fields. At this time, consolidating the socialist thought and enthusiasm of the broad masses of cooperative members became the most important task. In particular, the affluent middle peasants, after the socialist debate, some felt relieved and transformed from passivity to activity, while others were hesitant and at a loss. They said that the capitalist road was indeed impassable, but how exactly should the socialist road be taken? In the past, they were "frogs in a well," but now they must look further and see what the future holds.
    The county work team and the cooperative's Party branch, in accordance with the members' demands, first organized the study of the 1956-1967 National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), and inspired everyone to discuss and formulate long-term plans based on the spirit of the program and the specific conditions of the cooperative. In this way, the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of cooperative members immediately turned to production and construction. All twelve production teams in the cooperative brainstormed and conducted small debates, identifying the potential for increased production in various aspects of the cooperative, and initially put forward more than eighty suggestions, which mainly included: transforming 500 mu of low-lying land along the Fen River; formulating new channel plans to connect all the cooperative's irrigated land into large tracts; planting trees and forests to develop Qiao Jia Gou into a fruit tree ditch; and raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer and develop sideline production, etc. During the debate, the cooperative members' morale was high, greatly promoting the current autumn harvest and wheat planting work. The changes in the ideological sentiments of some affluent middle peasants were particularly evident. They showed, most prominently, that they actively contributed their wheat planting techniques. Each production team had two or three experienced affluent middle peasants personally operating the seed drills. They broke with convention and started early and worked late every day, striving to complete the sowing task in a timely manner. Zhang Shuanghu, Zhang Linsheng, and Zhang Naidian, three affluent middle peasants who operated seed drills in the third production team, took the initiative to propose mutual inspection and competition to ensure the quality of sowing. They said: Now we can see the hope of socialism. In the past, we only thought about getting rich for ourselves and planning for our children and grandchildren, but now we want everyone to have a good life, and we want to plant socialist trees for our children and grandchildren to enjoy the cool shade of socialism. All the cooperative members unanimously agreed that this year's wheat has the most fertilizer applied, and the sowing quality is also the best in history. In recent days, the cooperative's leadership has summarized everyone's opinions and written a draft of a long-term plan.
    The good news of the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) has greatly encouraged the cooperative members' enthusiasm and confidence in production and construction. They are preparing to debate the cooperative's draft long-term plan in accordance with the spirit of the various provisions of the program.

    把社会主义的热情及时地引导到生产上去
    雄火社转入生产建设大辩论
    讨论农业纲要，制定远景规划，社员情绪高昂，富裕中农也积极起来
    本报洪赵29日电　山西省洪赵县雄火农业社获得社会主义大辩论的“思想丰收”以后，已经转入了生产建设大辩论。
    这个农业社前一段经过了两条道路的反复的思想争辩，资本主义思想受到了有力的批判。人们走社会主义道路的积极性，从多卖余粮、收秋种麦以及街头田间的自由谈论中明显地反映出来。这时候，巩固广大社员的社会主义思想和热情，就成为头等重要的事。特别是富裕中农，在社会主义大辩论后，他们有的心情舒畅，变消极为积极，有的瞻前顾后，茫然若失。他们说，资本主义这条路确实走不通了，可是社会主义道路到底又怎样走法呢？过去是“井里的蛤蟆”，现在得看远些，要看看前景是什么样儿？
    县里工作组和社的党支部根据社员们这种要求，首先组织学习了1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案），启发大家根据纲要精神和社里的具体情况，讨论制订远景规划。这样，广大社员的社会主义热情立刻就转到生产建设方面来了。全社十二个生产队，分头出主意进行小辩论，找出社里各方面的增产潜力，初步提出了八十多条意见，其中主要包括改造汾河岸下五百亩低洼地；制订新的渠道规划，把全社水浇地联成大片；植树造林把乔家沟发展成果木沟；以及养猪积肥，发展副业生产等等。在辩论当中，社员们情绪高昂，大大推动了当前的秋收和种麦工作。有些富裕中农思想情绪的变化尤其明显，他们表现最突出的是把种麦的技术积极地贡献出来了。每个生产队都由三两个有经验的富裕中农亲自摇耧，他们打破惯例地每天起早带黑，争取适时完成了播种任务。在第三生产队摇耧的富裕中农张双虎、张林生、张乃典三人，主动提出互相检查和比赛，保证播种质量。他们说：这下可看到社会主义奔头了。过去光想自己发财给自己儿孙后代打算，现在要叫大家过好日子，要给儿孙后代栽社会主义的树，歇社会主义的荫凉。全社社员一致认为：今年小麦上粪最多，播种质量也是历史上从来没有过的好。这几天，社的领导已经把大家的意见归纳起来，写成一个远景规划草稿。
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布的喜讯传到雄火农业社后，又大大鼓舞了社员们生产建设的热情和信心。他们正在准备根据纲要各项规定的精神，对合作社的远景规划草稿进行辩论。
