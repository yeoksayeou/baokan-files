Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative Debates "What is Most Precious"
    Inspiring Farmers to Love Socialism
    This newspaper, Hongzhao, Shanxi, 16th dispatch (Reporter Lü Jianzhong): Since the Xiong Huo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiajiluo Village, Hongzhao County, Shanxi Province, launched a major debate on the issues of grain and the cooperative, it has reaped great benefits. The socialist consciousness of the members has been raised to some extent, and the grain purchase task has also been overfulfilled. However, at this time, the members only generally realized that capitalism is bad and that the socialist road should be taken, but it was not clear why socialism is good and what relationship socialism has with everyone's personal interests.
    After the county party committee work group and the Caililei branch clarified this situation, they continued to organize more in-depth debates. They held a meeting of party members to discuss the issue of the communist worldview. They also specifically convened a meeting of wealthy middle peasants to inspire everyone to expose their views on joining the cooperative, selling grain, and socialism. At the same time, members were asked to combine their studies with the article "Who Are the Most Beloved People" and the heroic behavior of the martyr Liu Hulan from this province.
    During the debate, everyone gradually focused on
  the question of "What is most precious?" Thus, everyone expressed their opinions. Some wealthy middle peasants said that grain is the most precious because with grain, you don't have to worry about food or clothing. Their tireless labor for many years was for grain. Someone refuted this opinion, saying that although grain is precious, why did more than 150 of the 280 households in Xiajiluo Village not have enough to eat and had to borrow money before liberation? The other 100 or so households also ate thin gruel year-round. Now with the cooperative, the wheat yield per mu is 509 jin, more than double that before liberation. All members of the cooperative have generally reached the standard of living of middle peasants. From this point of view, socialism is the most precious. With socialism, everyone can have enough to eat.
    At this time, wealthy middle peasant Liang Jinlin put forward a different view. He believed that the volunteers were the most precious because when the volunteers were fighting the American devils in Korea regardless of their lives, they sometimes didn't even eat grain, but "a mouthful of fried flour and a mouthful of snow." So everyone further studied what the volunteers were suffering and working hard for in Korea. They risked their lives to fight the American devils to protect our socialist construction. They ate fried flour and snow so that everyone would not eat fried flour and snow and everyone could live a good socialist life. At this time, Shu Zhizhong interjected and said: That's because the volunteers have good ideology. Ideology directs action, so it can be said that "ideology is the most precious." So everyone refuted: You can't say that ideology is the most precious in general terms. Chiang Kai-shek and the landlords also have ideology. Theirs is reactionary ideology, and their ideology directs actions against socialism, while the actions of the volunteers are to protect socialism. From this point of view, the most precious thing is the socialist ideology of the volunteers. We should all have the idea that individual interests are subordinate to socialist interests.
    In another room, some people also proposed that
  "children are the most precious" because without children there would be no descendants, and without descendants there would be nothing. Wealthy middle peasant and female member Zhang Xiaolan proposed that "mothers are the most precious" because her mother raised her by feeding her excrement and urine. At this time, poor peasant Du Wenxiu said: Parents and children are both precious, but in the old society, parents and children were not necessarily protected. Some people at the meeting cited past examples from the village to prove this point; before liberation, the Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan came to the village to arrest and kill people. On one occasion, the Japanese invaders killed nine people in one day. The wife and children of wealthy middle peasant Zhang Maochong were burned to death by the Japanese invaders in their house. Zhang Maochong never started a family again, and his white-haired old mother still had to cook and sew for him. Now we are no longer suffering this devastation, precisely because we have socialism. With socialism, everything is guaranteed.
    On this issue, some Communist Youth League members also participated in the debate, saying: Mothers and children are of course precious, but why did Liu Hulan abandon her mother and sacrifice her life? Didn't Liu Hulan love her mother? Didn't her mother love her child? As a result of the debate, everyone believed that Liu Hulan had a communist worldview, and she disregarded her own life for the sake of socialist interests. From this, everyone also realized that it is shameful for some members to only care about their personal interests and not the interests of the cooperative and the country.
    In addition, everyone also put forward many personal views, some said that money is the most precious, some said that reputation is the most precious, and some said that leather shoes and watches are the most precious, and so on. After the final five days of large and small meetings and debates, these views were all refuted. Everyone felt that all roads lead to socialism, and they sincerely felt that socialism is the most precious. Therefore, everyone must establish socialist ideology and overcome capitalist ideology and bourgeois individualism. Everyone said: In the past, money entered the cooperative, now the heart has also entered the cooperative. Du Wenxiu said as if he had suddenly seen the light: "We used to complain because we had not established a socialist ideology. With socialist ideology, all difficulties can be overcome." Wealthy middle peasant Zhang Qingshun reviewed his past mistakes of only wanting to speculate and get rich and complaining about not having enough grain, and said: "I now understand clearly that with capitalist ideology, socialist ideology cannot be established."
    After the whole cooperative went through the grain, cooperativization, and finally this major debate, it greatly stimulated the socialist enthusiasm of the members. The members voluntarily proposed that in order to build socialism faster, they were willing to reduce the grain standard from 420 jin to 400 jin. On this basis, all members enthusiastically discussed and formulated the cooperative's second five-year plan and current production plan. They planned to increase the yield per mu of the whole cooperative from 815 jin this year to 1,018 jin next year. By the last year of the second five-year plan, the yield per mu will reach 1,600 jin. They are full of confidence that they will raise the living standards of every household in the cooperative to the level of wealthy middle peasants next year.
    Immediately afterwards, the whole cooperative set off a production upsurge of autumn harvesting, fighting drought, and planting wheat. In addition to continuing to develop water conservancy, it has now accumulated 130,000 dan of fertilizer. Of the 15 households in the eighth production team, nine are wealthy middle peasants. In the past, their production was the least active, but now, the sounds of them carrying manure echo across the dawn fields every day.

### 雄火农业社辩论“什么最宝贵”  启发农民热爱社会主义

　　雄火农业社辩论“什么最宝贵”
    启发农民热爱社会主义
    本报山西洪赵16日电  记者吕建中报道：山西省洪赵县下纪落村雄火农业生产合作社自从在粮食、合作社问题上开展大辩论以来收获很大，社员的社会主义觉悟有所提高，粮食征购任务也超额完成。但是这时候社员们还只是一般地认识到资本主义不好，应该走社会主义道路，至于社会主义为什么好，社会主义和大家的切身利益有些什么关系，就不清楚了。
    县委工作组和彩里垒支部摸清这种情况以后，便继续组织更深入的辩论。他们开了党员会，讨论共产主义人生观的问题。又专门召开了富裕中农会，启发大家暴露自己对入社、卖粮以及对社会主义的看法。同时让社员结合着学习“谁是最可爱的人”一文和本省刘胡兰烈士的英雄行为。
    在辩论当中，大家逐渐集中在
  “什么最宝贵”这样一个问题上来。于是各抒己见。有的富裕中农说，粮食最宝贵，因为有了粮食就吃不愁穿不愁，自己多少年来没命的劳动，就是为了粮食。有人就反驳这个意见说，虽说粮食是宝中宝，可是在解放前下纪落村二百八十多户为什么有一百五十多户不够吃、借债，另外一百多户也常年吃稀的，现在有了合作社，小麦每亩产量五百零九斤，比解放前翻了一翻，全社社员一般都达到了中农生活水平，这样看来还是社会主义最宝贵，有了社会主义才能叫大家都有粮食吃。
    这时候富裕中农梁金林又提出了不同的看法，他认为志愿军最宝贵，因为志愿军不顾生命在朝鲜打美国鬼子的时候，有时连粮食都不吃，而是“一口炒面一口雪”。于是大家又进一步研究志愿军在朝鲜吃苦、拚命是为了什么，他们拚命打美国鬼子是为了保卫咱们的社会主义建设，他们吃炒面吃雪是为了咱们大家都不吃炒面不吃雪、大家都过社会主义好生活。这时恕志忠又插入说：那是因为志愿军思想好，思想支配行动，这样说就是“思想最宝贵”。于是大家又反驳说：不能那样笼统说思想最宝贵，蒋介石、地主也有思想，他们是反动思想，他们的思想支配的是反对社会主义的行为，而志愿军那种行动却是为了保卫社会主义。这样看来，最宝贵的还是志愿军那种社会主义思想，咱们大家也应该有志愿军那种个人利益服从社会主义利益的思想。
    在另一个屋子里，还有人提出
  “孩子最宝贵”，因为没有孩子就没有后代，没有后代就什么也没有了。富裕中农、女社员张筱兰则提出“母亲最宝贵”，理由是她母亲一把屎一把尿才把她养活大了。这时，贫农杜文秀说：父母、孩子都宝贵，可是在旧社会父母孩子也不一定保得住。会上有些人就举村里过去的例子证明这一点；解放以前日寇、阎锡山都到村里抓人杀人，有一次一天就被日寇杀了九个人。富裕中农张毛虫的老婆孩子一起被日寇烧死在屋里了，张毛虫再也没成起个家来，至今还得白发苍苍的老母亲做饭缝衣。现在不受这种涂炭了，就在因为有了社会主义，有了社会主义就什么都有了保障。
    在这个问题上，有些共青团员也参加辩论说：母亲孩子当然宝贵，可是刘胡兰为什么撇下了自己的母亲，牺牲了自己的生命。难道刘胡兰不爱她的母亲，她的母亲不疼自己的孩子吗？辩论的结果，大家认为刘胡兰就是因为有了共产主义的人生观，她为了社会主义利益连自己的生命也不顾。由此大家也认识到有的社员只顾个人利益不顾合作社和国家的利益是可耻的事。
    此外大家还提出了很多个人的看法，有的说金钱最宝贵，有的说名誉最宝贵，还有的说皮鞋手表最宝贵等等。经过最后五天的大会小会辩论，这些看法都被驳倒了。大家感到条条道路都通往社会主义，都心悦诚服地觉得社会主义最宝贵，因此每个人都必须树立社会主义的思想，克服资本主义思想和资产阶级个人主义思想。大家说：过去是钱入社，现在心也入了社。杜文秀像豁然开朗似地说：“咱们过去叫苦就是因为没有树立起社会主义思想，有了社会主义思想什么困难都能克服了。”富裕中农张清顺检讨了自己过去光想投机发财和闹粮食不够吃的错误行为以后，说：“我现在算认识清了，有了资本主义思想，社会主义思想就建立不起来。”
    全社经过粮食、合作化以及最后这次大辩论后，大大激发了社员们的社会主义热情，社员们自动提出为了更快建成社会主义，情愿把四百二十斤的粮食标准减低为四百斤。全体社员就在这种基础上热烈地讨论和订立了社里第二个五年计划和当前的生产计划。他们计划全社明年每亩产量由今年八百一十五斤提高到一千零一十八斤。到第二个五年计划最后一年每亩产量将达到一千六百斤。他们满怀信心地要在明年使每户社员的生活水平都达到富裕中农的生活水平。
    紧接着，全社就掀起了一个收秋、抗旱种麦的生产热潮，除继续发展水利外，现已积肥十三万担。第八生产队十五户中有九户富裕中农，过去生产最不起劲，现在，他们那担粪的哎哟声每天震荡着黎明的田野。
