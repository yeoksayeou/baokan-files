Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 6th. After studying the situations and problems of the Great Blooming, Great Letting Loose, and Great Debates in over three thousand townships across the province, the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently instructed all localities to quickly take measures to reverse the erroneous thinking of cadres at all levels, such as not being open-minded enough in the Great Blooming and Great Letting Loose and simply seeking quick results, so as to promote the in-depth development of the movement. After receiving this instruction from the Provincial Committee, local and county committees convened meetings of the local, county, district, and township cadres one after another to criticize right-leaning thoughts, clarify the important significance of the Great Blooming and Great Letting Loose, and conduct a major inspection of townships where the Blooming and Letting Loose had already begun. After the inspection, some regions canceled measures and methods unfavorable to the Blooming and Letting Loose; those townships where the Blooming and Letting Loose were not thorough or the debates were poor also identified the reasons, reorganized their forces, and continued the Great Blooming, Great Letting Loose, and Great Debates. Some townships had not started the Blooming and Letting Loose at all and did not have sufficient strength to grasp leadership; these townships have temporarily stopped the Blooming and Letting Loose and will proceed in batches later. According to an inspection of 539 townships in the Yishan area where the Blooming and Letting Loose had already begun, some townships hastily concluded the Blooming and Letting Loose in two or three days and turned to the Great Debates; within a commune, some production teams did not participate in the Blooming and Letting Loose at all; generally, poor peasants and lower-middle peasants participated more, while wealthy peasants participated less, and women even less; generally, minor issues were raised more, while major issues were raised less. After inspection and arrangements throughout the region, the movement is gradually deepening. In the townships where the work has been carried out relatively well, the vast majority of people have participated in the Blooming and Letting Loose, and wealthy peasants have also initially expressed some opinions. Liupo Township in Yishan County conducted three inspections, and the number of people participating in the movement in the entire township increased from 71% to 82%, and the number of people participating in the Blooming and Letting Loose increased from 72% to over 90%. In Long'an Township, Yulin County, five evening meetings were held during the Blooming and Letting Loose, and the masses raised many questions and opinions. The cadres thought that it was "almost done" and planned to end the Blooming and Letting Loose and move on to debates. After inspection, it was found that 11% of the adult commune members had not attended the meetings, and 29% of those who attended had not spoken; out of 75 upper-middle peasant households, 30 had not expressed their opinions, and the remaining 45 had not finished expressing their opinions. Therefore, the masses were mobilized to continue the Great Blooming and Great Letting Loose. Now, 93% of the people in the entire township have participated in the Blooming and Letting Loose, and all 75 upper-middle peasant households have spoken their minds and voluntarily participated in the debates.

　　During the Great Blooming, Great Letting Loose, and Great Debates, all localities have also begun to pay attention to the work of rectification and reform while rectifying, thereby further promoting the Blooming and Letting Loose.

    取消不利于鸣放的措施　找出争辩不好的原因
    广西大鸣大放深入展开
    新华社南宁6日电　中共广西省委最近研究了全省三千多个乡开展大鸣大放大争的情况和问题以后，曾指示各地迅速采取措施扭转各级干部对大鸣大放不够放手和简单图快等错误思想，使运动深入发展。各地委和县委接到省委这一指示以后，都先后召开了地、县委会议和区、乡干部会议，批判了右倾思想，明确大鸣大放的重要意义，并对已经开始鸣放的乡进行了一次大检查。经过检查，有的地区把不利于鸣放的措施和方法取消了；凡鸣放不彻底或争辩不好的乡，也找出原因，重整旗鼓，继续大鸣大放大争。有部分乡根本没有鸣放起来，又没有足够力量掌握领导，这些乡已暂时停止鸣放，待以后分批进行。据宜山地区已展开鸣放的五百三十九个乡的检查，有的乡鸣放两三天就草草结束，转入大辩论；在一个社里，又有一些生产队根本没有鸣放；一般是贫农、下中农鸣放得多，富裕农民鸣放得少，妇女鸣放得更少；一般问题放得多，主要问题鸣放得少。全区经过检查和布置以后，运动正在逐步深入。开展得较好的乡绝大部分人已参加了鸣放，富裕农民也初步放出了一些意见。宜山县六坡乡进行了三次检查，全乡参加运动的人已由71％增加到82％，鸣放的人已由72％增加到90％以上。郁林县龙安乡在鸣放中开了五个晚上的会，到会群众提了不少问题和意见，干部就认为“差不多了”，打算结束鸣放，转入辩论。经过检查，成年社员还有11％的人没有到会，到会的又有29％没有发言；七十五户上中农，有三十户未发表意见，其余四十五户意见还没有提完，因此，又继续发动群众大鸣大放。现在，全乡已有93％的人参加了鸣放，七十五户上中农，全部讲出了他们的内心话，并且自愿参加辩论。
    在大鸣大放大争的同时，各地并开始注意边整边改工作，从而进一步推动了鸣放。
