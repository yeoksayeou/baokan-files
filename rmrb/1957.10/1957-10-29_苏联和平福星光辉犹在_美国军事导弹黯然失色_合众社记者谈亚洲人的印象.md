Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: A dispatch from Tokyo by United Press International reporter Hanson states that for ordinary Asians, "Sputnik" (the transliteration of the Russian word "satellite") remains a sensation; the missile launches conducted by the United States last week "have not restored the prestige the United States lost when the Russians reached outer space."

During the U.S.-British summit talks last week, the United States continuously announced that it had launched several missiles and rockets, including a medium-range missile and a "Vanguard rocket" launched in Florida, USA. However, it was announced that this "Vanguard rocket" was only the engine of the first stage of a three-stage rocket; and of the two rockets recently launched on Eniwetok Island in the Pacific, the "launch result" of one was "unclear."

The American reporter said that the missile and rocket tests conducted by the United States have largely gone unnoticed by Asians. "People think the United States is a 'novice' in missiles."

Hanson also said that a factor that is not unimportant in the minds of many Asians is that the weapons launched by the United States are all designed for future nuclear wars. On the other hand, "Sputnik" is clearly a scientific instrument.

Hanson concluded by saying that the newspapers of the 25th have forgotten about the American missile and rocket launches. However, "Sputnik" is still high up there, orbiting the Earth.

    苏联和平福星光辉犹在
    美国军事导弹黯然失色
    合众社记者谈亚洲人的印象
    新华社28日讯东京消息：合众社记者汉森从东京发出的一条消息说，对于普通的亚洲人说来，“斯普特尼克”（俄文“卫星”的译音）仍然是风头十足的东西；美国在上周所作的几次导弹发射，“并没有为美国挽回它在俄国人到达外空时所失去的威望”。
    美国在上周举行美英首脑会谈期间，曾经连续宣布说美国发射了几枚导弹和火箭，其中包括在美国佛罗里达州发射的中程导弹和“先锋式火箭”。但是，据宣布，放射出的这支“先锋式火箭”只是三阶段火箭的第一阶段的引擎；而在最近在太平洋恩纳威托克岛发射的两支火箭中，有一支的“发射结果不明”。
    这位美国记者说，美国进行的发射导弹和火箭的试验在亚洲人中很少有人注意就过去了。“人们认为美国在导弹方面是个‘新手’”。
    汉森还说，在许多亚洲人的心目中并非不重要的因素是美国发射的都是为了未来的核战争而设计的武器。另一方面，“斯普特尼克”显然是一种科学仪器。
    汉森最后说，25日的各家报纸都忘掉了美国发射导弹和火箭的事。可是，“斯普特尼克”仍然高高地在那里，绕着地球旋转。
