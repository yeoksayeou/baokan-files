　　Under the care and attention of the Party and the government, in recent years, a large number of historical relics have been discovered throughout the country and properly preserved by specialized institutions, becoming one of the country's extremely valuable assets. The rightists' slander that "in the eight years since liberation, the Party and the government have only destroyed文物, not protected them" can be proven to be nonsense from any aspect.

　　For example, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom relics discovered this year include the following categories:

　　I. Weapons. The Anhui Provincial Museum and the Nanjing Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Memorial Hall discovered three early Taiping Heavenly Kingdom iron cannons in Hefei and Feixi, Anhui Province. Among them, two iron cannons cast in the fifth year of Yimao (1855-56) and the sixth year of Bingchen (1856-57) were the first to be discovered in the country. They are now in the collection of the Nanjing Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Memorial Hall. The place where the iron cannons were discovered—Sanhe Town—is where the English King Chen Yucheng and the Loyal King Li Xiucheng joined forces in September of the eighth year of Wuwu (1858) of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to annihilate the counter-revolutionary elite Xiang Army led by Li Xubing. There are also remnants of the Taiping Army's blockhouses and city walls from that year.

　　II. Documents. Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, discovered the original engraved editions of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's "Regulations on Determining Scholars' Grades" and "Authentic Records of Military Camps" in purchased waste paper, which are unique copies discovered in China for the first time. Previously, they were only collected in the United Kingdom, housed in the British Museum and the Cambridge University Library. The "Regulations on Determining Scholars' Grades" publishes the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's regulations on imperial examinations, examination hall regulations, and systems of rank badges and clothing. The "Authentic Records of Military Camps" is a collection of poems, essays, and proclamations written by the Dry King Hong Rengan when he was ordered to urge troops and passed through Anhui and Zhejiang.

　　III. Proclamations. The Public Security Bureau of Fenghuang County, Hunan Province, discovered an "Announcement to Pacify the People by the Right Tenth Commander of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and a "Tribute Certificate" from the Imperial Envoy and Minister of Winter (冬官正丞相) to Chen Bugaodeng and others of Toutangchang Factory, Qianxi County, Dading Prefecture, Guizhou, for their submission to the Heavenly Dynasty. These were probably left behind when the Wing King Shi Dakai led his troops out of Guangxi, through Hunan, and into Hubei in the eleventh year of Xinyou (1861-62).

　　IV. Flags. Chongde County, Zhejiang Province, discovered a triangular flag with the words "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Ordered to Pacify the People." The flag is made of white homespun cotton cloth and is stamped with a large rectangular vermilion seal.

　　V. Various Vouchers. The Jiangsu Provincial Museum Preparatory Office discovered a "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Loyal King Land Certificate" in Changshu County. This land certificate was issued by Gui Ren, the money keeper in Changshu and Zhaowen counties of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, to Fang Fenggang, a peasant proprietor. It bears the vermilion seal of the Loyal King. The Zhejiang Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee discovered two "door plates" issued by Bao Tianyi, the chief general of the Left Army of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and Huang Chengzhong, in Shangyu County, as well as several "License for Paying Door Plate Fees," "License for Group Stove Business Households," and "License for Paying Silver Business Households." One "Imperial Edict" was issued by Huang Qihong to Jin Hanfei, a villager in Shangyu, proving that Jin was "returning home from trading far away, his hair is not long, and some people may not know the details and use this to intimidate him." If anyone intimidates him or creates trouble, "the civilians are allowed to bring him to the camp for interrogation." Recently, "road passes," "card passes," "door plates," land certificates, miscellaneous tax receipts, grain coupons, and other items have been discovered in Haining, Chongde, and other counties. The "road pass" (or road certificate) was issued by Zhou, the commander of the Middle Camp of the Rear Army of Haining Prefecture, to Chen Guantong, a villager, written in ink, stating that Chen was selling pine trees to Qi Asan and was allowed to "pass through official checkpoints without being taxed as usual." The figures filled in on the "card pass" show the taxation situation of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's tax system for the circulation of goods by small merchants. "Road passes" and "card passes" are rare. The Shanghai Municipal Cultural Relics Sorting and Storage Warehouse rescued a tax payment notice from the eleventh year of Xinyou (1861-62) of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province—an "Easy to Know Notification Single" (易知由单).

　　VI. Inscriptions. A tombstone of Huang Shengfang, the Second Right Army Commander of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, was discovered in Yong'an (Mengshan), Guangxi Province. The stele is brick-carved, which is extremely rare. It is understood that only four tombstones of officials and generals of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom have been discovered, and the other three are all stone-carved.

　　VII. Letters. Mr. Liang Renbao discovered a letter from Wang Fufang, the commander of the Rear Camp of the Fourth Army in the Taiping Army, to Prime Minister Qin (Ri Gang) during the founding of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in Yong'an. In the letter, Wang Fufang reported to Qin Rigang the fact that he had arrested a Qing Dynasty secret agent for poisoning and that the Qing Dynasty had tried to recruit him.

　　VIII. Relics and Remains. The Guangdong Provincial Cultural Center collected portraits of Hong Xiuquan's grandparents and his tile chopstick holder, as well as the classroom and residence where Hong Xiuquan taught in Bailaba Village, Shiling, Huaxian County, and the place where the "God Worshipping Society" held its initial gatherings.

　　Among these revolutionary cultural relics, such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's flag to pacify the people, the original proclamations, and brick-carved tombstones, had never been discovered before. The discovered cultural relics reflect some of the social and political conditions at the time. (Huang Peixi)

　　今年发现了哪些太平天国文物
    在党和政府的关怀和重视下，近年来，在全国各地大量发现历史文物，并由专门机构加以妥善保管，成为国家极其宝贵的财富之一。右派分子说：“解放八年来，党和政府对于文物只有破坏，没有保护”的谰言，从任何方面都可证明是在胡说。
    即如今年发现的太平天国时期的文物有以下各类：
    一、武器。安徽省博物馆和南京太平天国纪念馆在安徽省合肥市、肥西一带发现太平天国早期铁炮三尊。其中乙卯五年（1855—56）和丙辰六年（1856—57）铸造的两尊铁炮是全国第一次发现的。现藏南京太平天国纪念馆。铁炮发现的地方——三河镇，是太平天国戊午八（1858）年九月，英王陈玉成和忠王李秀成会师歼灭反革命精锐部队湘军李续宾部的地方，这里还有当年太平军的炮台和城墙遗迹。
    二、文献。江苏省常熟县在收购的废纸中发现太平天国的“钦定士阶条例”和“钦定军次实录”原刻本，是国内第一次发现的孤本。以前，只有英国收藏，分藏在伦敦博物馆和剑桥大学图书馆。“钦定士阶条例”刊载太平天国科举考选规程，考场条例以及品级章服等制度。“钦定军次实录”是干王洪仁玕奉旨催兵，路经安徽、浙江途中所写的诗歌、论文和宣谕的文集。
    三、布告。湖南凤凰县公安局在清理敌伪档案时发现“太平天国殿右拾指挥”的安民告示一件和钦差大臣冬官正丞相给贵州大定郡黔西属头塘厂陈步高等归顺天朝的“贡照”一件。可能是辛酉十一年（1861—62），翼王石达开率部出广西、经湖南到湖北时遗留下来的。
    四、旗帜。浙江省崇德县发现“太平天国奉令安民”三角旗一件。旗是白色土棉布制成，上盖有长方朱色大印。
    五、各种凭据。江苏省博物馆筹备处在常熟县发现“太平天国忠王田凭”一件，这张田凭是太平天国在常熟、昭文两县的守钱桂仁发给自耕农方风岗的，上有朱色忠王印。浙江省文物管理委员会在上虞县发现太平天国殿左军主将宝天义、黄呈忠发的“门牌”二件，“缴门牌费执照”、“团灶业户执照”，“完银业户执照”若干件。“钧谕”一件，是黄起宏发给上虞乡民金翰飞的，证明金系“在远方贸易回家，留发未长，恐有人未知底细，借此吓诈”，如有人对他吓诈生端，“许该民人扭送来营，以凭讯究”。最近又在海宁、崇德等县发现“路票”、“卡票”、“门牌”、田凭、零税单、粮票等多件。“路票”（或称路凭）是海宁州后军中营师帅周发给乡民陈关通的，用墨笔书写，内容是陈将松树出卖与戚阿三，准他“凡过官卡，有无捐税照例放行”，从“卡票”上所填数字可以看出，太平天国的赋税制度对小商民流通物资的收税情况。“路票”和“卡票”是罕见的。上海市文物整理仓库在废纸中抢救出太平天国辛酉十一年（1861—62）江苏省太仓县的催纳田税通知单——“易知由单”一件。
    六、碑刻。在广西省永安（蒙山）发现太平天国右二军帅黄盛芳墓碑一件。碑系砖刻，极为罕见。据了解，目前发现的太平天国官将墓碑仅四件，其余三件均系石刻。
    七、函件。梁任葆先生在桂林发现太平天国建国永安时期，太平军中四军后营师帅汪夫方致秦丞相（日纲）的信函一件。汪夫方在信中向秦日纲报告逮捕一个清朝密探放毒和清朝向他招降的事实。
    八、遗址遗物。广东省文化馆搜集到洪秀全祖父母的画像以及他用过的瓦质箸筒等物，还发现洪秀全在花县狮岭白腊?村教书时的教室和住屋，以及组织“拜上帝会”初期集会的地点。
    这些革命文物中，像太平天国的安民旗帜，布告原件以及砖刻墓碑等等，是从来没有发现过的。从发现的文物中，可以看出当时的一些社会、政治情况。　　（黄培熙）
