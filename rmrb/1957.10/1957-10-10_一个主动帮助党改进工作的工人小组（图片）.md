    A Workers' Group Actively Helping the Party Improve its Work

    During the rectification campaign, Xu Zhanrong, a veteran worker in the repair section of the large rolling mill workshop at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, actively helped the Party improve its work and initiated the establishment of a "rectification and construction team." Since its establishment on September 22, this team has addressed thirty-five issues in production based on opinions raised by workers.

    Xu Zhanrong (front right), leading the rectification and construction team, is studying improvement methods based on the opinions raised by the workers.

    The rectification and construction team published a "Brief Report to Promote Understanding," reporting on the situation of airing views and their progress in improving work. Here, young workers Zhang Yingmu (right), Qian Zhilin (center), and Kong Qingwen (left) from the team are using their spare time to research the next issue's report.

    一个主动帮助党改进工作的工人小组
    在整风期间，重庆钢铁公司大型轧钢车间修理工段老工人徐占荣积极帮助党改进工作，倡议成立“整改施工小组”。这个小组自9月22日成立以来，已在生产上处理了三十五项意见。
    徐占荣（前右）领导下的整改施工小组，正在根据工人们提出的意见，研究改进办法。
    整改施工小组办了一个“放透简报”，报道鸣放情况和他们改进工作的情况。这是这个小组的青工张应木（右）、钱志林（中）、孔庆文（左）利用业余时间研究下一期的报道。
