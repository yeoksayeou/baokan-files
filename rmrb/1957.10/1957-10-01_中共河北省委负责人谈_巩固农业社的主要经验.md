Xinhua News Agency, Baoding: This year is a year of significant victory for the cooperative system in the rural areas of Hebei Province. To understand the main experiences in consolidating agricultural cooperatives, Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed the person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC.

The person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC said: In the struggle to achieve this victory, we have gained the following three aspects of experience:

The development of production is the basic condition for consolidating cooperatives, but in the matter of developing agricultural production, we must carry out a struggle between two lines. In most cases, we should pay attention to constantly overcoming the conservatism that exists in people's minds. He said that because Hebei Province suffered from floods last year and was affected by negative factors in rural areas, coupled with the fact that many people had a one-sided understanding and acceptance of the criticism of excessive production plan targets and the lack of adaptation to local conditions in the promotion of technology last year, a right-leaning conservative ideology emerged among cadres and the masses. Many regions and cooperatives lowered their production plan requirements, became skeptical of advanced experience, and had less enthusiasm for production reform. This tendency was reversed after Chairman Mao put forward the call to "overcome difficulties in every possible way and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture" and after carrying out the ideological struggle against right-leaning conservatism, which laid the ideological foundation for realizing this year's agricultural increase. He said that the experience of Cangxian Prefecture in adhering to "one reclamation and three reforms" and achieving an increase of 600 million catties of grain in two years proves that a spirit of reform based on local conditions and the superior conditions of cooperatives can not only make production develop, but also make production leap forward.

This person in charge said that this spring, the Provincial Party Committee proposed that all cooperatives in the province should catch up with or surpass the production level of well-to-do middle peasants within three to five years, which played a great role in overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking and giving play to the production enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. Now, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province are working hard to catch up with or surpass the production level of well-to-do middle peasants within three to five years. This is the first step in enabling cooperatives to become prosperous under the current technical conditions.

He said: Opposing right-leaning conservative tendencies, actively promoting effective advanced experiences and science and technology, boldly mobilizing the masses, and carrying out production reforms in light of local conditions are also important conditions for achieving success in production in the future.

When talking about the second experience of consolidating the cooperatives, the person in charge of the Provincial Party Committee said: It is necessary to correctly regulate the relationship between the state, the cooperative, and the members, and oppose the phenomenon of only taking care of the interests of one party while ignoring the interests of the other party. He said that last year was the first year of realizing cooperation in the province, and many contradictions appeared in the production, distribution, organization, and management of the cooperatives. For example, the size of some cooperatives and teams was too large, making management inconvenient; the management committee of the cooperative managed too much and too strictly, which was not conducive to giving play to the initiative of the production team and the members; excessive emphasis was placed on collective interests and long-term interests, and insufficient consideration was given to the current personal interests of the members, and so on. It was impossible to solve all these problems in the first year of running the cooperatives. In the two rectification movements last winter and this year, we focused on solving these contradictions in a planned way. Because these problems were basically solved, the internal relations of the cooperatives were further coordinated, and the labor enthusiasm of the members was improved, which enabled the cooperatives to be in an advantageous and active position in the struggle between the two roads.

The person in charge said that it is worth pointing out that another kind of bias has begun to appear in the regulation of the various aspects of the cooperative’s relationships. That is, the individualistic and departmentalist thinking of unilaterally emphasizing individual interests and immediate interests, while neglecting collective interests, national interests, and long-term interests, has raised its head. This kind of thinking is manifested in the relationship with the state, demanding less purchase and more sales of grain, and demanding more loans and less repayment or no repayment of loans; in the relationship with the cooperative, demanding more distribution and less accumulation; in personal life, the phenomenon of not being thrifty is growing. This tendency is detrimental to the country’s socialist construction and the consolidation of cooperatives and must be resolved in the rural rectification. All members are required to promote the fine tradition of building the country diligently and thriftily, running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily, and to establish the idea of unifying patriotism, love for the cooperative, and love for the family.

The person in charge of the Provincial Party Committee especially talked about the fact that, in order to meet the requirements of expanded reproduction in the cooperatives, the contradiction between accumulation and consumption that currently stands out should be appropriately regulated and resolved. He said that with the growth of cooperative production, the income of the members and public accumulation should both increase reasonably year by year. However, the tendency of only increasing members’ consumption while disregarding the needs of expanded reproduction must be overcome. The cooperatives must continuously expand investment in production within the scope of possibility in order to rely on their own strength to solve the funds needed for basic construction in the agricultural cooperatives. Correctly resolving this contradiction is a decisive link in ensuring the growth of cooperative production. After distribution last year, members of the Southwest Village Agricultural Cooperative in Feixiang County built more than 90 new houses and bought 20 bicycles, but the cooperative's funds were extremely difficult, so much so that they had to sell two mules to maintain production. A different situation can be seen in the Rongsheng Cooperative in Wu'an County. After resolving the members' thinking of "only caring about immediate enjoyment and not caring about major production benefits," this cooperative plans to increase its public accumulation fund from 2.2% of total income to 8% this autumn, with an average increase of 32 yuan in member income compared to last year. It will use 60,000 yuan to build a small hydropower pumping station and 2,500 yuan to build a granular fertilizer factory, and run a middle school. These constructions will be funded jointly by the cooperative and its members.

The person in charge of the Provincial Party Committee said that the third experience is to resolutely and unswervingly implement the Party's class line in rural areas, strengthen socialist education, overcome the wavering nature of well-to-do middle peasants, and at the same time, vigorously crack down on the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, which is of decisive significance for consolidating the cooperatives.

He said that socialist transformation has completed the change of ownership, but the socialist transformation in politics and ideology has not yet been completed. Moreover, the class enemies are not reconciled to the demise of their class, so the class struggle has not been extinguished. This class struggle is sometimes intertwined with contradictions among the people. Many of our comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of this complex struggle situation. After realizing cooperation, many people believe in general terms that "everyone is a member now, it doesn't matter whether or not the class line is needed!" They gradually paralyzed their vigilance against landlords and rich peasants, blurred the boundaries between themselves and the capitalist thinking of well-to-do middle peasants, and the viewpoint of relying on poor and lower-middle peasants also became faint. After the Central Committee's instructions on launching a large-scale socialist education movement in rural areas were implemented, and after the initial launch of the socialist debate in rural areas, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants felt invigorated. Those party members and cadres whose class viewpoints were blurred and who lacked a sufficient understanding of the serious significance of the struggle between the two roads began to examine and criticize their right-leaning thinking, and many people have actively joined the socialist debate and are fighting against anti-socialist words and deeds.

The person in charge of the Provincial Party Committee said that poor and lower-middle peasants are loyal supporters of the rural socialist system, its pillars, and the foundation for consolidating cooperatives. Any cooperative that truly establishes the leading advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants and continuously improves their consciousness will not be shaken by evil winds. Such cooperatives account for more than 85% of the province. For example, in Xuanhua County, because they often pay attention to carrying out political and ideological work among the peasants, they have issued 15 instructions on socialist propaganda in two years, and have organized three large-scale propaganda movements with leadership, and the class line has been better implemented. Therefore, under the attack of disasters and evil winds, not a single peasant in the county's 98 cooperatives withdrew from the cooperatives. In Jinghai County, because ideological work was weak and the class line was not implemented well enough, more than 1,000 households in the county requested to withdraw from the cooperatives. After work, 353 households finally withdrew.

The person in charge said that the different situations of the Songjiazhuang Cooperative in Xuanhua County and the Huzhuangzi Cooperative in Jinghai County show that how the class line is implemented determines the success or failure of the cooperative. The backbone of Songjiazhuang in Xuanhua County is all long-tested poor peasants, and they look for poor peasants when they encounter difficulties. For example, when the cooperative was short of 10,000 catties of feed, the well-to-do middle peasants proposed to ask the state for it, but the cooperative cadres proposed that everyone should solve it by saving. The 25 management committee members first saved 1,600 catties, and the poor peasants also responded positively. As a result, the entire cooperative saved a total of 12,000 catties of grain, solving the entire shortage of feed. Because poor peasants stood up to fight against words and deeds that were detrimental to the cooperative, the thinking of well-to-do middle peasants has no market in Songjiazhuang. The leadership of the Huzhuangzi Cooperative in Jinghai County was completely controlled by well-to-do middle peasants. After planning in many ways, they suddenly dissolved the cooperative one night. When the secretary of the township Party committee went to ask the reason, the "director" said: "We had a plan long ago, the cooperative will not be run, and you don't have to educate us." Establishing a cooperative requires relying on poor and lower-middle peasants, and consolidating a cooperative also requires relying on poor and lower-middle peasants. Without relying on poor and lower-middle peasants, we cannot unite the middle peasants and we cannot consolidate the cooperatives. This has become a theorem. It is not enough to unite the well-to-do middle peasants only through economic concessions. We must also transform their thinking. There must be both unity and struggle (ideological criticism and reasoning struggle). Struggle is precisely for the purpose of transforming and uniting them.

The person in charge finally said that we rely on the leadership of the Party Central Committee, on the hard work of the Party organizations throughout the province and the people of the province, and we are full of confidence in ushering in an even greater victory in the further consolidation of the cooperative system.

    中共河北省委负责人谈
    巩固农业社的主要经验
    据新华社保定讯  今年是合作化制度在河北省农村取得重大胜利的一年。新华社记者为了了解巩固农业社的主要经验，访问了中共河北省委负责人。
    中共河北省委负责人说：我们在为取得这个胜利而进行的斗争中，得到了以下三方面的经验：
    生产的发展是巩固合作社的基本条件，但在发展农业生产问题上，必须进行两条路线的斗争，在多数情况下，应该注意经常克服存在于人们头脑中的保守主义。他说，由于去年河北省遭受了水灾和受到农村消极因素的影响，再加上不少人对去年批评生产计划指标要求过高和推广技术缺乏因地制宜的缺点，在认识和接受上有片面性，在干部和群众中曾产生了一种右倾保守思想。不少地区和合作社，对生产计划的要求降低了，对先进经验产生了怀疑，生产改革的劲头小了。这种倾向，在毛主席提出“千方百计，克服困难，争取农业大丰收”的号召后，经过开展反右倾保守的思想斗争，才得到了扭转，才为实现今年农业增产奠定了思想基础。他说，沧县专区坚持进行“一垦三改”，在二年内获得增产六亿斤粮食的经验证明：从本地情况和合作社的优越条件出发的改革精神，不只使生产有发展，而且可以使生产跃进。
    这个负责人说，今年春季，省委提出全省合作社要在三、五年内赶上或超过富裕中农的生产水平，这对于克服右倾保守思想、发挥干部和群众的生产积极性，起了很大作用。现在，全省农业社正为在三、五年内赶上或超过富裕中农的生产水平而努力。这是在目前技术条件下使合作社走向富裕的第一步。
    他说：反对右倾保守倾向，积极推广行之有效的先进经验和科学技术，放手发动群众，因地制宜地进行生产改革，也是今后生产取得成绩的重要条件。
    省委负责人谈到巩固社的第二条经验时说：必须正确地调节国家、社和社员三方面的关系，反对只顾一方面利益而忽视另一方面利益的现象。他说，去年是全省实现合作化的第一年，合作社在生产、分配、组织和管理上出现许多矛盾。如部分社、队的规模过大，管理不便；社管理委员会统一管理的过多过严，不利于发挥生产队和社员的积极性；过分地强调集体利益、长远利益，对社员目前个人利益照顾不够等等。这些问题，在办社的第一年不可能都得到解决。在去年冬季和今年的两次整社运动中，我们就着重地有计划地来解决这些矛盾。由于这些问题的基本解决，就使合作社的内部关系得到进一步的协调，社员的劳动积极性提高了。也就使合作社在进行两条道路的斗争中处于有利的和主动的地位。
    负责人说，但是，值得提出的是，在调节合作社的各方面关系中，目前已经开始显露出另外一种偏向。就是片面地强调个人利益、眼前利益，忽视集体利益、国家利益和长远利益的个人主义、本位主义思想抬头了。这种思想，表现在和国家的关系上，对粮食要求少购多销，对贷款要求多贷少还或不还；在和社的关系上，要求多分少积累；在个人生活上，不节俭的现象滋长了。这种倾向对国家社会主义建设和合作社的巩固，都是不利的。必须在农村整风中加以解决。要求全体社员发扬勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家的优良作风，树立爱国、爱社、爱家三者统一的思想。
    省委负责人特别谈到，为了适应合作社扩大再生产的要求，对于目前突出存在的积累和消费之间的矛盾，应该适当地调节和解决。他说，随着合作社生产的增长，应该使社员的收入和公共积累都逐年有合理的增加。但是，要克服那种不顾扩大再生产的需要，而只增加社员消费的倾向。合作社必须在可能范围内，不断扩大对生产的投资，以便依靠自己的力量，解决农业社基本建设所需要的资金。正确地解决这个矛盾，是保证合作社生产增长有决定意义的环节。肥乡县西南庄农业社去年分配后，社员盖新房九十多间，买自行车二十辆，但社内资金却极端困难，以致不得不卖掉两头骡子来维持生产。从武安县荣胜社可以看到另外一种情况。这个社在解决了社员“只顾眼前享受，不顾生产大利”的思想之后，在社员收入比去年平均增加三十二元的情况下，今秋计划把公积金由占总收入的2.2％，增加到8％。用六万元修小型水力扬水电站一座，用二千五百元修颗粒肥料厂一座，办中学一处。这些建设由社和社员共同出资兴办。
    省委负责人谈到第三条经验时说，坚决地毫不动摇地贯彻党在农村中的阶级路线，加强社会主义教育，克服富裕中农的动摇性，同时，有力地打击地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏活动，对于巩固合作社有决定的意义。
    他说，社会主义改造，完成了所有制的改变，政治上思想上的社会主义改造还没有完成；而且，阶级敌人不甘心自己阶级的灭亡，因而阶级斗争并没有熄灭，这种阶级斗争，有时又与人民内部矛盾交错在一起。我们许多同志对这种复杂的斗争形势认识不足。不少人在实现合作化之后，笼统地认为“都是社员了，阶级路线要不要没有关系了！”逐渐麻痹了自己对地主、富农的警惕性，模糊了和富裕中农的资本主义思想的界限，依靠贫农和下中农的观点也就淡漠了。中央关于在农村展开大规模的社会主义教育运动的指示贯彻之后，以及农村社会主义大辩论初步展开之后，广大贫农、下中农感到振奋；那些阶级观点模糊和对两条道路斗争的严重意义认识不足的党员、干部，开始检查、批判自己的右倾思想，有不少人已经积极投入社会主义大辩论，向反社会主义的言行进行斗争。
    省委负责人说，贫农和下中农是农村社会主义制度忠诚的拥护者，是它的支柱，是巩固合作社的基础。凡是真正树立了贫农和下中农的领导优势，而且又不断地提高他们的觉悟的合作社，在邪风中就不会被动摇。这样的合作社，在全省已占到85％以上。如宣化县由于经常注意了对农民进行政治思想工作，两年内发出过十五次关于社会主义宣传的指示，有领导地组织过三次大规模的宣传运动，阶级路线贯彻执行较好，因此，在灾害和邪风袭击下，全县九十八个合作社没有一户农民退社；静海县则由于思想工作薄弱，阶级路线贯彻得不够好，全县要求退社的曾达到一千多户，经过工作最后还是有三百五十三户退出去了。
    负责人说，从宣化县宋家庄和静海县胡庄子两个合作社的不同情况中，也可以看到，阶级路线贯彻执行得怎样，决定着合作社的胜败。宣化县宋家庄的骨干都是久经锻炼的贫农，他们有了困难就找贫农。比如全社缺一万斤饲料，富裕中农提出向国家要，社干部则提出由大家用节约办法解决。二十五个管理委员会委员，首先节约一千六百斤，贫农也都积极响应，结果全社共节约了一万二千斤粮食，解决了所缺全部饲料。由于贫农遇到不利于社的言行，就起来斗争，富裕中农的思想在宋家庄是没有市场的。静海县胡庄子社的领导，完全被富裕中农所把持，他们经过多方谋划，在一个夜里突然把社解散了。乡党委书记去追问原因，“主任”说：“我们早有计划，社是不办了，你也别教育了。”建立合作社要依靠贫农、下中农，巩固合作社同样也要依靠贫农、下中农；不依靠贫农和下中农，就不能团结中农，就不能巩固合作社，这已成为定理。对于富裕中农，只有经济上的让步是不足以团结他们的，还必须改造他们的思想。有团结又要有斗争（思想批判、说理斗争），斗争，正是为了改造和团结他们。
    负责人最后说，我们依靠党中央的领导，依靠全省党组织和全省人民的艰苦努力，满怀信心地迎接合作化制度进一步巩固的更大的胜利。
