    On "Less Said, the Better"
    Li Ziyu

    After the anti-Rightist struggle came to a temporary end, some units are now undergoing rectification and continuing to air their views. Some people, after much deliberation, have summarized an "experience" called "Less Said, the Better," believing that adopting this attitude will allow them to successfully pass the socialist test. This is not the case, because the four words "Less Said, the Better" are concise but contain issues of ideological stance and political attitude. If someone attempts to destroy socialism and establish capitalism, it would be "not good" if you "say less" about such words and deeds, as this is equivalent to abandoning your position and surrendering to the enemy. If you "say less" about shortcomings in work and the faults of others, it is also "not good," as this liberal attitude will prevent shortcomings from being improved and faults from being overcome, which is harmful and detrimental to the socialist cause. If you hold a "Less Said, the Better" attitude towards your own erroneous words and deeds, this plants the seeds of danger from the perspective of ideological transformation and work improvement.

    As long as it benefits the Party, the people, and the socialist cause, we should not only not say less, but also say more. If it is detrimental to the Party, the people, and the socialist cause, we should not only not "say less," but should not say it at all. The quality of speech does not depend on how much or how little is said, but on: who is saying what? Whose class standpoint are they standing on, and which class interests are they representing when they speak?

    The current rectification movement requires us to present the facts, reason things out, and engage in extensive airing of views, unreserved expression of opinions, and robust debate. Everyone must engage in ideological exchanges and confrontations. Words are tools for expressing thoughts. Only by expressing inner thoughts can we distinguish right from wrong, draw clear ideological boundaries, strengthen our proletarian stance, enhance our socialist awareness, and achieve the goal of upholding truth and correcting errors. To uphold truth, we must engage in debate, because things cannot be clarified without speaking, and reason cannot be understood without debate. To correct errors, we must engage in criticism and self-criticism, and we must never hold the attitude of "knowing it's wrong, but saying less is better."

    谈“少说为妙”
    李子玉
    有些单位在反右派斗争告一段落之后，目前正进行着重整改并继续鸣放。有的人瞻前顾后总结出一条“经验”，叫做“少说为妙”，认为抱着这种态度，就可以过好社会主义这一关。其实不然，因为“少说为妙”四个字言简意赅，其中包含着思想立场和政治态度问题。如果有人企图破社会主义立资本主义，对这种言行，你要“少说”的话就不“妙”了，这就等于放弃阵地投降敌人。如果对工作中的缺点和别人的毛病，“少说”也是不“妙”的，这种自由主义的态度，会使工作缺点得不到改进，别人的毛病得不到克服，对社会主义事业是有害而无利的。如果对自己的错误言行，抱着“少说为妙”的态度，从改造思想和改进工作方面来说，这是埋下了危险的根苗。
    只要有利于党，有利于人民，有利于社会主义事业的话，我们不但不能少说，而且要多说。不利于党，不利于人民，不利于社会主义事业的话，不仅不要“少说”，而且应该根本不说。话的好坏不在于说的多或少，而在于：什么人说的什么话？站在那个阶级立场代表那个阶级利益说话？
    目前整风运动，要摆事实、讲道理、展开大放大鸣大争。大家都要思想见面、思想交锋。话语是表达思想的工具，只有说出了内心话，才能辨明大是大非，划清思想界限，才能坚定无产阶级立场，提高社会主义觉悟，才能达到坚持真理修正错误的目的。要坚持真理，就要展开辩论，因为话不说不清，理不辩不明。要修正错误，就必须进行批评和自我批评，决不能抱着“明知不对，少说为妙”的态度。
