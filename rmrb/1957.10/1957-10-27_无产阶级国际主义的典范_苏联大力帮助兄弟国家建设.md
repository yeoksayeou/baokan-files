A Model of Proletarian Internationalism
The Soviet Union Vigorously Helps Fraternal Countries in Their Construction
Assistance to Korea
(Our Dispatch from Pyongyang, October 26) Comprehensive reports from Korean newspapers indicate that the economic and technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union has played a significant role in the economic development of Korea.
After the Korean armistice in 1953, the Soviet Union provided Korea with 1 billion rubles in grant aid and forgave half of the loans it had agreed to provide to Korea under the 1949 loan agreement. When a Korean government delegation visited the Soviet Union last July, the Soviet Union decided to forgive another 530 million rubles of the past loans to Korea and provide Korea with an additional 470 million rubles in assistance, of which 300 million rubles were in grant aid.
Korea has used all of the 1 billion rubles in grant aid provided by the Soviet Union after the armistice in its post-war three-year plan, using this aid to restore, expand, and build many factories and enterprises. Among them, the restored and expanded facilities include: the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works, the Seongjin Steel Mill, the Nampo Smelting Plant, the Supung Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, the Pyongyang Textile Factory, and a portion of the electrified railway. Newly built facilities include: the Pyongyang Silk Textile Factory, the Sariwon Tractor Repair Plant, the Pyongyang Red Cross Central Hospital, and the Central Broadcasting Station.
The restored and expanded factories and enterprises mentioned above have all been put into production, and most of the newly built ones are nearing completion. The restoration and construction of these factories and enterprises form the backbone of Korean industry.
The technical equipment provided by the Soviet Union for these capital construction projects is the latest and most modern. Needless to say for the newly built ones, the restored and expanded factories and enterprises have also fundamentally transformed the backward technology of the past. For example, the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works, restored with Soviet assistance, had a daily output of only 300 tons from one blast furnace during the Japanese occupation. After restoration and production, the average daily output of one blast furnace reached 550 tons in 1956 and 900 tons in July of this year.
In addition, according to the 1 billion rubles of grant aid, the Soviet Union also assisted Korea with many technical equipment, fuels, various transport vehicles, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as well as daily necessities and foods such as grain, medicine, and textiles needed by various economic sectors in Korea.
The 470 million rubles that the Soviet Union decided to aid Korea last July were mainly to help Korea develop agriculture. In addition, it also assisted Korea with materials such as steel, logs, sugar, oils, dairy cows, raw cotton, cotton fabrics, cotton yarn, tractors, construction machinery, and transport vehicles. These aid materials are now being shipped to Korea one after another.
In addition, the Soviet Union also provided a lot of assistance to Korea in terms of technology and personnel training. After the Korean armistice, the Soviet Union sent many technicians and experts to Korea to help with restoration and construction. Korea also sent a large number of students and interns to the Soviet Union for study. Many of the personnel who have returned from studying or interning in the Soviet Union have taken on important positions such as chief engineers of factories, faculty members of universities, and principals.
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 26th: Bui Cong Thanh, Director of the Finance and Economic Office of the Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, gave an interview to our reporter on the 22nd regarding Soviet assistance to Vietnam. He explained in detail the great significance of Soviet selfless assistance to the restoration and development of the national economy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
Bui Cong Thanh said that the Soviet Union gave Vietnam 400 million rubles in grant aid in 1955 and 1956; and this year it gave Vietnam a long-term loan of 47 million rubles.
Soviet aid is used to help Vietnam develop its economy and culture in order to continuously improve the people's living standards. Most of the aid is used to purchase means of production. Of the aforementioned 400 million rubles in grant aid, 266 million rubles were used to purchase means of production, accounting for 66.5% of the total. Most of the 47 million rubles in long-term loans this year will also be used to purchase means of production.
Using the grant aid given to Vietnam, the Soviet Union helped Vietnam build the following projects in heavy industry, electricity, and transportation: a tin mine, a medium-sized machine factory, a phosphate fertilizer plant, a phosphate mine, five power plants, two small hydropower stations, the erection of hundreds of kilometers of high-voltage power lines, 33 large transformer stations, two machine and tractor repair stations, and two other state-owned construction enterprises. In addition, it also supplied Vietnam with a batch of machines for producing acetylene, Hong Gai coal mine drilling machines, coal transport vehicles, mining machinery, tractors, and many other types of vehicles.
In light industry and other areas, the Soviet Union helped Vietnam build a fish cannery, two tea factories, four large oil depots, many small oil depots, three water plants, a 150-kilowatt radio station, a weather station, and ten broadcasting stations.
In the fields of culture, education, and health, the Soviet Union helped Vietnam equip a university laboratory and two secondary school laboratories, and supplied equipment and medicines for a modern hospital in Vietnam.
Bui Cong Thanh said that many of the Soviet aid projects listed as consumer goods are also to meet the needs of production, culture, education, and health. For example, the consumer goods aid projects in 1955 and 1956 included: 26,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, 5,000 tons of cotton, and 170,000 tons of rice. In addition, there were 9 million meters of cloth and a lot of gasoline, tires, medicines, and paper.
Bui Cong Thanh said that in the past three years, the Soviet Union has sent 1,050 experts to Vietnam, including industrial, agricultural, forestry, cultural, educational, health experts, and teachers. These also included a geological exploration team and three mobile medical teams.
From 1951 to now, Vietnam has sent 649 students to study in the Soviet Union, and another 256 interns have interned in various industrial construction departments in the Soviet Union.
He said that thanks to the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and also thanks to the efforts of the Vietnamese people themselves, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was able to basically end the economic recovery phase in the short period of more than three years from the restoration of peace to the end of this year, and laid the foundation for further economic development.
Bui Cong Thanh finally said that the economic development of North Vietnam and South Vietnam in opposite directions vividly illustrates that the "aid" from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries has a different meaning from the "aid" from the United States. The "aid" from the United States is to turn South Vietnam into its colony forever, while the reason why the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries selflessly assist us in economic and cultural aspects is to help us overcome difficulties and backwardness and make the Democratic Republic of Vietnam an economically independent and culturally developed country. This is in line with the common interests of the people of socialist countries and all peace-loving people in the world.
Our Dispatch from Prague, October 26: Our reporter recently interviewed Kozoł, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of Czechoslovakia. Comrade Kozoł introduced to the reporter the economic assistance and economic cooperation provided by the Soviet Union in the socialist construction of Czechoslovakia.
Comrade Kozoł mentioned that the Soviet Union has repeatedly given Czechoslovakia loan assistance at important moments. For example, as soon as Czechoslovakia was liberated, the Soviet Union immediately gave a large amount of industrial equipment and raw materials, which played a very important role in Czechoslovakia's recovery of production. In 1947, Czechoslovakia suffered from a severe drought and poor harvest. Thanks to the Soviet Union's loan to Czechoslovakia on the most favorable terms and the import of 600,000 tons of grain from the Soviet Union, the people of Czechoslovakia were spared from famine. This is something that the people of Czechoslovakia will never forget. Comrade Kozoł said that the Soviet Union is a pillar of decisive significance in Czechoslovakia's foreign trade and economic cooperation, and trade with the Soviet Union is extremely important for Czechoslovakia's economic development. The volume of trade between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union has increased year by year. If 1948 is taken as 100, it has increased to 352 in 1956. In that year, trade between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union accounted for 32% of Czechoslovakia's total foreign trade, while it accounted for only 1% before the war in 1937.
To illustrate this point, Comrade Kozoł pointed out to the reporter that grain (and other foods) and industrial raw materials each account for approximately 40% of the total value of goods imported by Czechoslovakia from the Soviet Union. These industrial raw materials, such as large amounts of petroleum, iron ore, non-ferrous metals, rubber, cotton, wool, etc., are of great importance to Czechoslovakia's industrial production and development and the people's lives. Since 1950, 74% of the iron ore, 70% of the copper, 90% of the nickel, 70% of the aluminum, and 81% of the petroleum imported by Czechoslovakia have been imported from the Soviet Union. This year, 60% of Czechoslovakia's flour is milled from wheat supplied by the Soviet Union. The Soviet cotton imported this year can be spun into cloth to provide 21 meters per person nationwide.
The main supplies from Czechoslovakia to the Soviet Union are machinery and equipment, as well as various machine tools. This not only continuously expands Czechoslovakia's industrial production, but also provides a stable market for this expanded industrial production.
Comrade Kozoł said that during those years when imperialist countries carried out a strict blockade and embargo against socialist countries, it was mainly due to this trade with the powerful Soviet Union that Czechoslovakia and other people's democratic countries were not only unaffected economically, but also achieved rapid development.
Czechoslovakia itself is an industrially developed country, unlike other socialist countries where many basic construction projects often need to be built entirely with the help of the Soviet Union. However, Comrade Kozoł also pointed out in this regard that the Soviet Union has still helped Czechoslovakia build many factories, especially some projects that require the use of the latest scientific and technological achievements. For example, Czechoslovakia's first atomic reactor, several national defense industrial factories, chemical plants, and factories that manufacture antibiotics, etc. The Soviet Union will also help Czechoslovakia build its first nuclear power plant.
Comrade Kozoł said that Czechoslovakia has also received great assistance in terms of scientific and technological cooperation. In those industrial sectors that are decisive for socialist construction, especially the heavy machinery manufacturing industry, great benefits have been gained due to the Soviet Union's selfless provision of blueprints and other technical documents, as well as the help of experts. Since 1948, more than 2,000 Czechoslovak engineering and technical personnel have directly gone to Soviet factories and research institutes to study Soviet technical experience. Currently, more than 70 scientific or technical research institutes and their counterparts in the Soviet Union regularly exchange research plans, materials, experiences, and results. This cooperation is very considerable in terms of saving manpower and financial resources for Czechoslovakia.
Comrade Kozoł concluded by saying that without the powerful first socialist country, the Soviet Union, with its highly developed industry and science, it would be impossible to build a socialist economy in Czechoslovakia, given its specific conditions.

    无产阶级国际主义的典范
    苏联大力帮助兄弟国家建设
    对朝鲜的援助
    本报平壤26日电　综合朝鲜报纸消息，苏联给予朝鲜的经济和技术援助，对朝鲜的经济发展起了巨大的作用。
    1953年朝鲜停战后，苏联给予朝鲜十亿卢布的无偿援助，并将根据1949年签订的贷款协定，提供给朝鲜的贷款的一半免予偿还。去年7月朝鲜政府代表团访苏时，苏联又决定将过去提供给朝鲜的贷款之中的五亿三千万卢布免予偿还，并再给朝鲜四亿七千万卢布的援助，其中三亿卢布是无偿援助。
  苏联在朝鲜停战后提供的十亿卢布的无偿援助，朝鲜已全用于战后三年计划中，用这些援助恢复扩建和新建了许多工厂企业。其中恢复扩建的有：金策制铁所、城津炼钢厂、南浦冶炼厂、水丰发电厂、兴南肥料工厂、平壤纺织工厂和一部分电气铁路。新建的有：平壤丝纺织工厂、沙里院拖拉机修理厂、平壤红十字中央医院、中央广播电台等。
    以上这些项工厂企业，恢复扩建的都已投入生产，新建的也正大部建成。这些工厂企业的恢复和建成，构成了朝鲜工业的骨干。
    苏联为这些基本建设工程所提供的技术设备都是最新式最现代化的。新建的不用说，恢复和扩建的工厂企业也都从根本上改造了过去落后的技术。如在苏联援助下恢复的金策制铁所，日本统治时期一座高炉日产量只有三百吨，战后恢复生产后1956年一座高炉的平均日产量达到五百五十吨，今年7月达到九百吨。
    此外，苏联根据十亿卢布的无偿援助，还援助了朝鲜各经济部门需要的许多技术设备、燃料、各种运输车辆、农业机械、化学肥料和农药以及粮食、医药、纺织品等日用品和食品。
    去年7月苏联决定援助朝鲜的四亿七千万卢布主要是帮助朝鲜发展农业的。另外，还援助朝鲜以钢材、原木、砂糖、油脂、乳牛、原棉、棉织品、棉纱、拖拉机、建设机械、运输汽车等物资。现在这些援助物资正陆续运来朝鲜。
    另外，苏联在技术上和培养干部方面也给予朝鲜很多的帮助。朝鲜停战后苏联派来许多技术人员、专家来朝鲜帮助进行恢复建设。朝鲜还选派了大批的留学生和实习生到苏联去学习。从苏联留学或实习回来的人员，有许多担任了工厂的总工程师、高等学校的教职员、校长等重要职务。
          对越南的援助
    据新华社26日讯　河内22日航讯：越南民主共和国总理府财政经济办公室主任裴公澄22日就苏联援助越南的情况向本社记者发表了谈话。他详细地说明了苏联的无私援助对越南民主共和国国民经济的恢复和发展的巨大意义。
    裴公澄说，苏联在1955年和1956年给了越南四亿卢布的无偿援助；今年又给越南四千七百万卢布的长期贷款。
    苏联的援助是用来帮助越南发展经济和文化，以不断提高人民的生活水平。援助大部分是用来购买生产资料的。在前述四亿卢布无偿援助中，用来买生产资料的有两亿六千六百万卢布，占总数的66.5％。在今年的四千七百万卢布的长期贷款中，大部分款项也是用来购买生产资料的。
    苏联利用给予越南的无偿援助，在重工业、电力和运输方面帮助越南建设了以下工程：锡矿一座、中型机器厂一座、磷酸盐厂一座、磷灰石矿一座、发电厂五座、小型水力发电站两座、架设成百公里的高压电线、大变压站三十三座、机器和拖拉机修理站两座、其他国营建筑企业两座。另外还供给越南生产乙炔的机器一批、鸿基煤矿的钻机、运煤车辆、矿山机器、拖拉机和许多其他种类的车辆。
    在轻工业和其他方面，苏联帮助越南建设了鱼罐头厂一座、茶厂两座、大型油库四座、小型油库多座、自来水厂三座、电力一百五十瓩的广播电台一座、气象台一座、广播站十座。
    在文教卫生方面，苏联帮助越南装备了一个大学实验室、两个中学实验室，供给越南一所现代化医院的设备和药品。
    裴公澄说，列为消费品的苏联援助项目中，许多也是为了满足生产和文教卫生事业的需要的。例如在1955、56年援助的消费品项目中有：化学肥料两万六千吨、棉花五千吨、大米十七万吨。此外还有布匹九百万公尺和许多汽油、轮胎、药品和纸张。
    裴公澄说，三年来，苏联派到越南来的专家，前后有一千零五十人，包括工业、农林、文教卫生专家和教师等。其中还包括一个地质勘探队和三个流动医疗队。
    从1951年到现在，越南派了六百四十九个学生到苏联留学，另外有二百五十六名实习生到苏联各工业建设部门实习。
    他说，由于苏联以及各兄弟国家的真诚的援助，也由于越南人民自己的努力，越南民主共和国才能在和平恢复到今年年底，短短的三年多期间，基本上结束了经济恢复阶段，并且为进一步发展经济打下了基础。
    裴公澄最后说，北越和南越经济向着相反方向的发展，生动地说明了苏联和各兄弟国家的援助同美国的“援助”有着不同的意义。美国的“援助”是为了把南越永远变成它的殖民地，而苏联以及各兄弟国家之所以在经济和文化方面无私地援助我们，是为了帮助我们克服困难和落后状态，使越南民主共和国成为经济独立和文化发达的国家。这同社会主义各国人民、同全世界爱好和平人民的共同利益是一致的。
      对捷克斯洛伐克的援助
    本报布拉格26日电　本报记者日前访问了捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易部副部长科佐尔。科佐尔同志向记者介绍了苏联在捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设中给予经济援助和进行经济合作的情况。
    科佐尔同志谈到苏联曾多次在重要的时刻给捷克斯洛伐克以贷款援助。例如，捷克斯洛伐克刚获得解放，苏联就立刻给予大量工业器材和原料，这对于捷克斯洛伐克恢复生产起着十分重要的作用。1947年，捷克斯洛伐克遭到严重旱灾和歉收，由于苏联以最优惠条件贷款给捷克斯洛伐克，从苏联输入了谷物六十万吨，使捷克斯洛伐克人民得以免于饥馑。这是捷克斯洛伐克人民永不忘怀的。科佐尔同志说，苏联在捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易和经济合作中乃是具有决定意义的柱石，同苏联的贸易对捷克斯洛伐克经济发展是极为重要的。捷苏贸易额逐年增加，如以1948年为一百，1956年已增为三百五十二。这一年，捷苏贸易在捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易总额中占了32％，而在战前1937年只占1％。
    为了说明这一点，科佐尔同志向记者指出粮食（和其他食品）和工业原料在捷克斯洛伐克从苏联输入的货物总值中各占约40％。这些工业原料，如大量的石油、铁矿砂、有色金属、橡胶、棉花、羊毛等，对于捷克斯洛伐克工业生产和发展及人民生活关系重大。自从1950年以来，捷克斯洛伐克进口的74％的铁矿，70％的铜，90％的镍，70％的铝，81％的石油，都是从苏联输入的。今年捷克斯洛伐克60％的面粉是用苏联供应的小麦磨的，今年进口的苏联棉花纺织成布后，可供全国每人二十一公尺。
    捷克斯洛伐克供应给苏联的主要为机器设备以及各种工作母机。这就既不断扩大了捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产，又使这扩大了的工业生产获得了稳定的市场。
    科佐尔同志说，在帝国主义国家对社会主义国家进行严密的封锁禁运的那几年中，就是主要由于同强大的苏联的这种贸易，才使捷克斯洛伐克和其他人民民主国家在经济上不仅没有受到影响，而且还获得了迅速发展。
    捷克斯洛伐克本身是工业发达国家，不像其他社会主义国家往往许多基本建设项目完全要由苏联帮助建设起来。但是科佐尔同志在这方面也指出苏联仍然帮助捷克斯洛伐克建立了不少工厂，特别是一些需要运用最新科学技术成就的项目。例如捷克斯洛伐克第一个原子反应堆、若干国防工业工厂、化工厂和制造抗生素的工厂等。苏联还将帮助捷克斯洛伐克建造第一个原子能发电站。
    科佐尔同志说，在科学技术合作方面，捷克斯洛伐克也得到很大帮助。在那些对社会主义建设具有决定意义的工业部门，特别是重型机械制造业，由于苏联无私地给予蓝图和其他技术文件，以及专家的帮助，都获得了很大利益。自从1948年以来，捷克斯洛伐克有二千多工程技术人员直接到苏联工厂和研究所学习苏联技术经验。目前有七十多个科学或技术研究所和苏联的同类机构经常交换研究计划、材料、经验和成果。这一合作对于捷克斯洛伐克节约人力财力一项来说，就是十分可观的。
    科佐尔同志最后说，如果没有工业和科学高度发展的强大的第一个社会主义国家苏联，就捷克斯洛伐克的具体条件来说，建设社会主义经济是不可能的。
