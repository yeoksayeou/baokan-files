Raising Cultural Levels Benefits Production
    Guangdong's Over One Million People Persist in Regular Part-Time Study

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) As of the end of June this year, 460,000 people in Guangdong Province have been freed from illiteracy, and more than 60,000 people have reached the cultural level of graduation from higher primary school or junior high school. Kai Ping County has basically eliminated illiteracy among urban workers, and Dafu Village in Zhangcuo Township, Nanhai County, and Dalingxia Village in Jieyang County have become villages without young illiterate people.

    In the first half of this year, about 1,450,000 people in Guangdong Province persisted in regular part-time study, including 1,020,000 in literacy classes, 240,000 in higher primary school classes, 160,000 in junior high school classes, and 30,000 in senior high school classes. After the working people learned culture, they created favorable conditions for developing production. For example, since the Baoding Agricultural Cooperative in Ledong County opened a people's school in April last year, 48 people have learned to record work points, and 28 people have become work point recorders. More than 95% of the cooperative members can now understand how work points are recorded, basically overcoming the past confusion in work accounts and increasing their enthusiasm for production.

    At present, a network of industrial and agricultural spare-time education has been initially formed throughout the province, from cities to villages. There are 1,400 staff and cadres engaged in industrial and agricultural spare-time education, and 100,000 people in the countryside serve as teachers in people's schools, of whom more than 15,000 have been awarded the honorary title of activists in eliminating illiteracy.

    提高文化　有利生产
    广东一百多万人坚持常年业余学习
    本报讯　广东省到今年6月底为止，已有四十六万人脱离了文盲状态，六万多人达到了高小和初中毕业的文化程度。开平县基本上扫除了城镇职工文盲，南海县张搓乡大富村和揭阳县大岭下村已经成为没有青年文盲的村子。
    今年上半年，广东省坚持常年业余学习的约有一百四十五万多人，其中扫盲班有一百零二万人，高小班有二十四万人，初中班有十六万人，高中班有三万人。劳动人民学习了文化以后，为发展生产创造了有利条件。例如乐东县保定农业社自从去年4月开办民校以来，到现在已有四十八人学会了记工分，二十八人当了记工员，全社95％以上的社员都能看懂了工分的记法，基本上克服了过去在工账上的混乱现象，提高了生产的积极性。
    目前，全省从城市到农村的工农业余教育网已经初步形成，工农业余教育职工干部就有一千四百人，在农村有十万人担任了民校教师，其中有一万五千多名获得了扫盲积极分子的光荣称号。
