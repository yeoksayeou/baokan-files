    Rural Health
    Duzhou Township Becomes Malaria-Free Township
    Duzhou Township in Changshou County used to be a well-known malaria area in Sichuan Province, but now it has become a malaria-free township.
    For many years, this township had a high incidence of malaria because of the many streams, damp land, and rapid breeding of mosquitoes. In recent years, although prevention and control work has been strengthened and the incidence rate has decreased year by year, there were still more than 580 people in the township suffering from malaria last year. In January of this year, the Changshou County Epidemic Prevention Station specially established a malaria prevention and control team in Duzhou Township, trained more than 150 activists, and launched a large-scale prevention and control campaign. By July, malaria had basically disappeared.

    农村卫生
    渡舟乡变成了无疟乡
    长寿县渡舟乡过去是四川省有名的疟疾区，现在已经成为无疟乡了。
    多少年来，这个乡因为境内小溪多，土地潮湿，疟蚊繁殖快，疟疾发病率高。近几年来，虽然加强了防治工作，发病率逐年都有下降，但是到去年为止，全乡仍有五百八十多人患疟疾。今年1月，长寿县防疫站在渡舟乡专门成立了疟疾防治组，训练了一百五十多名积极分子，展开了大规模的防治工作。到7月份，疟疾就基本绝迹了。
