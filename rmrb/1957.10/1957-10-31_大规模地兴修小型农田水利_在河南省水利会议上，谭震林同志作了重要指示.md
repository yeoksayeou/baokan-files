Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th: Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Work Conference and gave important instructions to the conference on the morning of the 26th. He called on all comrades and the masses to have the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, to launch a large-scale production and construction movement focusing on the construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, and strive for a bumper wheat harvest in 1958. He also called for a nationwide discussion on the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967) proposed by the Central Committee, to formulate specific plans for provinces, special districts, counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives, and to strive to gradually realize the agricultural development program and build a modern industry and modern agriculture.

	Have the Spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains
	Tan Zhenlin said that at the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, when discussing rural work, it was proposed that rural work must have a spirit. What is spirit? Spirit is determination, that is, to have a determination like the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains. It is to mobilize all positive factors to serve socialist construction. Not only does the countryside need this spirit, but all aspects of work need this spirit. Then, from the history of the Party's leadership in revolutionary struggle and production and construction, he used a large number of experiences to illustrate the importance of this spirit.

	Tan Zhenlin pointed out, where does this spirit come from? This is because our Party has grasped the demands of the masses, and the slogans, policies, and guidelines put forward by the Party are exactly what the masses need. Once the Party's policies and guidelines are grasped by the masses, they become an infinite material force. In the past, during the democratic revolution, the masses demanded the removal of the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Our Party grasped this demand of the masses and achieved the great victory of the democratic revolution. Entering the socialist revolution, the people demanded socialism and must remove the two mountains of capitalism and the individual economy. After the three major upsurges, what the people needed was to develop production and accelerate industrialization. The Party put forward the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Development Program and the principle of fast, more, good, and economical. Therefore, in 1956, miracles appeared in both industrial and agricultural construction. Although there were some shortcomings, the achievements were huge and fundamental, and were unimaginable by our ancestors for thousands of years. Henan has completed new water conservancy projects benefiting 6.1 million mu of land in one month of the drought resistance and wheat planting campaign, basically completing a year's plan in one month. What power is this? It is the huge material force generated by the Party's policies and guidelines being grasped by the masses.

	Criticize Right-leaning Thought, Vigorously Develop Agriculture
	Tan Zhenlin said that it is not easy to implement and maintain this spirit; it must go through many struggles. Because millions of people will not be uniform; there will always be advanced, intermediate, and backward. The backward do not feel that they are walking slowly, but instead criticize others for walking too fast. From July 1956 to May this year, the "good, more, fast, and economical" were not talked about much, and the "Forty Articles" were not very effective. Why? Because some people were desperately shouting, "You are running too fast"; and some of those running in front were also a little weak in the legs. Insufficient spirit is a kind of right-leaning thought. Now, Party committees at all levels are criticizing right-leaning thought, and the spirit has risen again. In addition, the socialist great debate in the countryside, the rectification movement in the organs, and the anti-Rightist struggle have created a political upsurge and a production upsurge. Therefore, the spirit has come in a big way, is more practical, and the strength is even more abundant. If we persist in this spirit and continue to struggle for five years during the Second Five-Year Plan, China will see even greater miracles.

	Tan Zhenlin elaborated on the importance of the Party's principle of vigorously developing agriculture on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. He said that industry relies on agriculture to supply grain and raw materials, and the market for industrial products is mainly in the countryside. In this sense, without agriculture, there is no industry. Therefore, on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, it is necessary to simultaneously vigorously develop agriculture. There must be a spirit in rural work, and propaganda on agriculture must be strengthened. Of course, while emphasizing agriculture, we must never ignore industry, and we must not forget that industry is still the main thing. The importance of industry must still be emphasized, especially heavy industry. We are not developing agriculture for the sake of developing agriculture, but for the sake of developing industry. We want to build modern industry and modern agriculture. Therefore, the spirit of developing industry cannot be relaxed either. We must comprehensively understand and correctly implement the Party's principle.

	Water Conservancy Construction is an Important Measure
	Tan Zhenlin said that water conservancy construction is the first of the twelve measures to increase crop yields in the National Agricultural Development Program's Forty Articles. The instability of agricultural production in our country is due to waterlogging and drought disasters. Both waterlogging and drought are water conservancy problems; too much water causes floods, and too little water causes droughts. To overcome floods, it is necessary to build water conservancy projects; to overcome droughts, it is also necessary to build water conservancy projects. Only by solving the water problem can other yield-increasing measures be effective; if there is only fertilizer and no water, it will not work. The Goucun Agricultural Cooperative in Meng County, Henan Province, implemented "five irrigations and three fertilizers," and the wheat yield per mu was 1,125 jin. As long as it is given five irrigations and three fertilizers, it will produce 1,125 jin of wheat for you. This shows the importance of water. The average wheat yield per mu in the country is more than 100 jin, which is ten times worse than this. If the water conservancy problem is solved, the wheat yield can be increased tenfold. The potential for agricultural increase is very large.

	To solve the water problem, Article 5 of the National Agricultural Development Program requires the elimination of ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters within twelve years. What is ordinary? There must be a standard. Suppose a single rainfall of 150 millimeters on flat ground and 200 millimeters in mountainous areas does not cause a disaster, it is considered to have eliminated ordinary floods; if in these areas, a single rainfall of 700 millimeters becomes a disaster, then it is not an ordinary flood. So, how to eliminate droughts? This year, most areas of Henan Province have not had rain for three whole months, causing an autumn drought. This requires that there must also be a standard for eliminating droughts. This standard is: calculated according to the different climates and the water needs of spring and autumn crops in various regions, it can be guaranteed that there will be no drought even without rain, and the crops will be ensured a good harvest. The first task of water conservancy construction is to determine a standard.

	Rely on the Masses, Mainly Small-Scale
	Once the standard is determined, the second question arises: is it better to rely on the state or on the masses? This issue has also been debated for a relatively long time. According to experience, it is not possible to completely manage water conservancy well by relying on the state's money. What to do? A possible solution is for the state to spend less money and rely on the masses; relying on the masses must mean engaging in small-scale farmland water conservancy, mainly small-scale farmland water conservancy. Because the masses cannot handle large and medium-sized projects. For soil and water conservation, trees must be planted. In the past, some places were given trees by the state and subsidies were given, but trees were planted every year but never became forests, and the survival rate was only 20% to 30%. However, in some places, the state did not give money, and the masses planted the trees themselves, and the survival rate reached 90%. This example shows that the principle of relying mainly on the masses and supplementing with the state, mainly small-scale and supplemented by medium-scale, and building large-scale when necessary and possible is correct.

	Tan Zhenlin then said, is it possible to eliminate ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters by mainly engaging in small-scale water conservancy? According to the current situation, it is basically possible. The so-called "basically" is because some large and medium-sized projects are still necessary. This water conservancy conference has summarized a lot of experience. In just two winters and two springs, so much experience has been accumulated. Jiyuan County started relatively early. It began to consider it in 1949 and started work in 1952. It only really started in the past four years, and only really worked hard in the two winters and two springs. The county built 100 small reservoirs, 93 of which were built in two winters and two springs. This year, Jiyuan County received 560 millimeters of rain. The Mang River within the county generally has a flow of more than 500 during the flood season. After the construction of these projects, only a flow of 70 appeared, reducing the flood flow by six-sevenths. The highest flow of this river is 1,000, and only 100 is discharged. The usual method of river management is to build large reservoirs and dig rivers; however, they have adopted methods such as building small reservoirs, closing mountains for afforestation, and building dry wells, and dozens of other small-scale water conservancy projects to control the floods of this river. Building so many projects only took 2.5 million workdays. Calculated according to the management area of the Mang River of 800 square kilometers, each square kilometer used more than 3,000 workdays. However, these projects were all done by relying on the masses, and the state only provided more than 200,000 yuan. The soil erosion and drought and flood disasters in Xuegou and Shanggou townships in Yu County were managed well in just one year. All were small-scale projects, and were also done by the masses themselves. Huai'bin County also successfully transformed low-lying land to eliminate waterlogging. Henan Province has also created successful experiences in transforming saline-alkali land and transforming sandy wastelands. These are all small-scale water conservancy projects. These facts fully prove that relying on the masses to build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects can basically eliminate ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters.

	Water Management Must Be Combined with Current Production
	Relying on the masses to engage in small-scale projects naturally brings a characteristic, which is that water management is combined with current agricultural production, that is, the immediate interests of the masses are combined with long-term interests. For example, to engage in soil and water conservation, fish-scale pits must be dug. After the pits are dug, trees can be planted and crops can be planted. The same is true for horizontal ditches. In this way, all costs can be recovered in three to five years. Once a small reservoir is built, it can be immediately used for irrigation and fish farming. For another example, to build terraced fields with ditches, one-third of the land must be sacrificed, but reeds, lotus roots, and fish can be planted in this one-third of the ditches, and the harvest will be much greater than the loss. In the past, we did not consider how to combine it with current production when we were engaged in large-scale projects. The Guanting Reservoir considered flood control and power generation. After it was built, the annual income from the fish raised now is equal to three times the reduced income from the land flooded by the reservoir. Because water is stored, the groundwater level around the reservoir has increased, and rice can also be grown, increasing production.

	Based on the experience of managing the Mang River, can other rivers be managed centrally on one or two tributaries? Can we do the tributaries first, then the main stream; the small first, then the big? All counties in mountainous areas must grasp this point and create experience with a small tributary. By next year, we will have more experience. Without our own experience, the determination will not be great. We must do it ourselves. Work hard during the slack season, work a little during the busy season, and stop during the busiest season. Of course, even with this approach, it is not guaranteed that every one can be managed well. Failure is the mother of success. If we fail this year, we will come again next year, and we will eventually succeed. The "Four, Five, Eight" Targets Can Be Fully Realized

	Tan Zhenlin said that the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft) from 1956 to 1967, proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in January 1956, and now revised and promulgated after two years of practice, is the program for developing agriculture in my country's socialist construction. It has two central keys: one is that in the three different regions of our country, by 1967, we will achieve grain yields of 400, 500, and 800 jin per mu, respectively, and the second is to store grain for emergency needs. Some comrades are worried about whether the "Four, Five, Eight" requirements can be realized, but in fact, in 1956, nineteen counties across the country had already reached this target, and Guangdong Province had eight counties that reached this target last year. And this year, 17 counties and cities in the Shantou Special Zone of Guangdong Province have reached more than 800 jin, six of which have reached 1,000 jin, and more than 90% of agricultural production cooperatives have reached more than 800 jin per mu. It is entirely possible to achieve the "Four, Five, Eight" requirements. This is just a direction, drawing a line, requiring areas with a yield of 400 jin per mu, and some may also reach 500 jin, 800 jin. Meng County in Henan Province reached the requirements of the program last year, and Jiyuan County also has typical experience of producing 2,000 jin of grain and 20,000 jin of vegetables per mu. We must consolidate and develop such achievements and promote such experience. Due to the high tide of agricultural cooperation promoting the development of agricultural production, 20% to 30% of farmers in rural areas now have stored grain. Our country's grain is still not abundant, and it is extremely important to save and store grain. Building the country diligently and thriftily, running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily are our principles for building socialism, and managing households diligently and thriftily is the foundation, so we must widely publicize and conscientiously implement it. Agricultural production cooperatives in Dingxi Special Zone, Gansu Province, generally have half a year's stored grain, one year's seeds, and one year's fodder for livestock. They are located in a dry area, and the lack of water and the difficulty of storing water can be said to be the first in the country. However, they stored pieces of ice and baskets of snow in water cellars, solved the problems of watering and planting, protecting seedlings, and drinking water for people and animals, and ensured the development of agriculture. The slogan of the Dingxi Prefectural Committee for water conservancy is: every cadre should be prepared to live ten years less in order to overcome drought. The Gansu Provincial Party Committee believes that their slogan for water conservancy is good and has issued the same call to cadres throughout the province. This year, the province will carry out soil and water conservation on 20,000 square kilometers. Now, the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program has been submitted to the people of the whole country for discussion, and all localities should enthusiastically organize this debate. From provinces and special zones to counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives, they must make their own plans in accordance with the spirit of the program and in light of local conditions. Provinces, special zones, and counties must complete this important work by May of next year.

	"Fertilizer is Grain"
	After pointing out that "fertilizer is grain" and it is necessary to strengthen fertilizer accumulation, Tan Zhenlin then said: Carrying out soil and water conservation in mountainous areas is closely linked to planting trees and afforestation to green our motherland and develop diversified economies. As long as there is determination and spirit, the problem of soil and water conservation can be basically solved within a small area in one year. Henan Province has also had successful experience in improving saline-alkali and sandy wastelands. It is necessary to make plans and complete this task within a certain period of time. Regarding the issue of agricultural mechanization, he said that we must actively develop the production of agricultural machinery and vigorously promote new agricultural tools. However, more attention should be paid to improving existing old agricultural tools. In the Third Five-Year Plan, the focus will still be on improving old agricultural tools. Promoting advanced experience is an important force in building socialism. Henan Province has many good experiences in increasing agricultural production. If they are promoted one by one, their role in increasing production will be immeasurable. The working people have inventions and creations every day and every hour, and advanced experiences appear. Therefore, the work of promoting advanced experience must be regularized.

    大规模地兴修小型农田水利
    在河南省水利会议上，谭震林同志作了重要指示
    新华社郑州29日电　中共中央书记处书记谭震林前来参加了河南省水利工作会议，并在26日上午向大会作了重要指示。他号召全体同志和群众要有愚公移山那样一股劲，掀起大规模的以兴修小型农田水利为主的生产建设运动，争取1958年小麦大丰收；对中央提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要修正草案，展开全民性的大讨论，制定省、专、县、区、乡、社的具体计划，为逐步实现农业发展纲要、为建设现代化的工业和现代化的农业而奋斗。
    要有愚公移山那股劲
    谭震林说，在党的三中全会上，讨论农村工作的时候，提出农村工作必须要有一股劲。劲是什么呢？劲就是决心，就是要有像愚公移山那样的一个决心。就是调动一切积极因素，为社会主义建设服务。不仅农村需要这股劲，而且各方面工作都需要这股劲。接着，他从党领导革命斗争和生产建设的历史中，以大量的经验说明这股劲的重要性。
    谭震林指出，这股劲怎么来的？这就是我们党掌握了群众的要求，党提出的口号、方针、政策正是群众的需要；而党的方针、政策一旦为群众所掌握，就成为无限的物质力量。过去在民主革命时期，群众要求搬掉帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座山，我们党掌握了群众这个要求，取得了民主革命的伟大胜利。进入社会主义革命，人民要求的是社会主义，必须搬掉资本主义和个体经济这两座山。三大高潮之后，人民需要的是发展生产，加快工业化建设，党提出了四十条农业发展纲要，提出了快、多、好、省的方针，因此，1956年在工农业建设上都出现了奇迹。虽然也有些缺点，但是成绩是巨大的、是基本的，是我们祖先几千年来所不敢想像的。河南目前在一个月的抗旱种麦运动中，新修各种水利工程，效益面积达六百一十万亩，一年的计划，在一个月内基本上完成了。什么力量呢？就是党的方针、政策为群众所掌握而产生的巨大的物质力量。
    批判右倾思想，大力发展农业
    谭震林说，这股劲贯彻下去，保持下来是不容易的，是要经过很多斗争的。因为千千万万的人不会是整齐划一的，总是有先进的，有中间的，有落后的。落后的人不觉得自己走慢了，反而要批评别人走快了。1956年7月到今年5月，“好、多、快、省”不大讲了，“四十条”不大灵了，为什么呢？就是有些人拼命喊：“你们跑快了”；而跑在前面的人，有的也有些腿软了。劲头不足，这是一种右倾思想。现在各级党委都在批判右倾思想，劲头又起来了。加上农村的社会主义大辩论，机关的整风运动和反右派斗争，出现了政治高潮和生产高潮，所以劲头来的大，更踏实，力量更加雄厚。如果我们把这股劲坚持下去，在第二个五年计划期间连续奋斗五年，中国就要出现更大的奇迹。
      谭震林论述了党的在优先发展重工业的基础上大力发展农业的方针的重要性。他说，工业要依靠农业供给粮食、原料，工业品市场主要在农村。从这个意义上讲，没有农业，就没有工业。所以在优先发展重工业的基础上，必须同时用大力发展农业，在农村工作上必须有一股劲，必须加强对农业的宣传。当然在强调农业的时候，绝不能忽视工业，不能忘记工业还是主要的，工业的重要性还必须强调，特别是重工业。我们不是为了发展农业而发展农业，而是为了发展工业而发展农业，我们要建设现代化的工业和现代化的农业。因此，发展工业的一股劲也不能放松。我们必须完整地理解和正确地贯彻党的这个方针。
      兴修水利是项重要措施
    谭震林说，兴修水利是全国农业发展纲要四十条中增加农作物产量的十二个措施中的第一个措施。我国农业生产不稳定，就是因为有水旱灾害。水旱灾都是水利问题，水多了就发生水灾，水少了就发生旱灾。克服水灾要兴修水利，克服旱灾也要兴修水利。解决了水的问题，其他的增产措施才能发挥效果；如果光有肥料，没有水那也不行。河南省孟县缑村农业社实行“五水三肥”，亩产小麦一千一百二十五斤。只要给它喝五次水，上三次肥料，它就给你产一千一百二十五斤小麦。这说明了水的重要。全国小麦平均亩产一百多斤，与此相比差十倍，如果水利问题解决了，小麦就能增产十倍。农业增产的潜力是很大的。
    解决水的问题，全国农业发展纲要第五条规定，要求在十二年内消灭普通的水旱灾害。什么叫普通的呢？这就要有一个标准。假定平地一次降雨一百五十公厘，山区降雨二百公厘，不造成灾害，算消灭了普通水灾；如果在这些地区，一次下雨七百公厘，成了灾，那就不是普通水灾。那么消灭旱灾呢？今年河南大部地区整整三个月没有下雨，秋旱了。这就要求消灭旱灾也要有个标准，这个标准就是：根据各个地区的不同气候和春秋作物需水情况计算，能保证不下雨也不受旱，作物保收。兴修水利的第一项就是要确定一个标准。
      依靠群众，小型为主
    标准确定了，就提出第二个问题，是依靠国家好呢？还是依靠群众好呢？这个问题也是争论比较久的问题。根据经验，靠国家拿钱，是不能完全办好水利的。怎么办呢？可能的办法就是国家少花钱，依靠群众；靠群众就必须是搞小型农田水利，以小型农田水利为主。因为，群众不能办大、中型的工程。搞水土保持要植树，过去有的地方由国家给树，给以补助，年年植树年年不成林，成活率只有20％到30％；而有的地方国家并不给钱，由群众自己栽，成活率就达到了90％。这个事例就说明，依靠群众为主、国家辅助，小型为主、中型为辅，必要和可能时兴修大型的方针是正确的。
    谭震林接着说，以小型水利为主，是不是可能消灭普通水旱灾害呢？根据现在情况看，基本上是可能的。所谓“基本上”，就是因为还必需要修建一些大、中型工程。这次水利会议总结了很多经验。时间仅只两冬两春，就积累这么多经验。济源县动手比较早，1949年开始考虑，1952年动手干，真正干起来只是近四年，大干也只是两冬两春。全县修一百座小水库，有九十三座是两冬两春搞的。今年在济源县下了五百六十公厘雨，境内漭河汛期一般有流量五百多个，而在修这些工程后，仅出现七十个流量，削减洪水流量七分之六。这条河最高流量是一千个，下泄只一百个，按平常治河办法是修大水库、挖河；可是，他们却采取了修小水库、封山育林、修旱井等几十种小型水利工程的办法，把这条河的洪水控制住了。修这样多的工程只做二百五十万个工。按漭河治理面积八百平方公里计算，每平方公里用三千多个工。但是，这些工程都是依靠群众做的，国家只拿二十几万元。禹县薛沟、尚沟两乡的水土流失和旱涝灾害，仅在一年内就治理好了，全部是小型工程，也是群众自己做的。淮滨县除涝改造洼地也成功了。其它在改造盐碱地、改造沙荒方面，河南省也都创造了成功的经验。这些都是小型水利工程。这些事实充分证明了依靠群众兴修小型农田水利工程是基本上可以消灭普通水旱灾害的。
      治水要和当前生产结合
    依靠群众搞小型工程，很自然地带来一个特点，这个特点就是治水和当前农业生产相结合，也就是群众眼前利益和长远利益相结合。比如搞水土保持，要挖鱼鳞坑，坑挖后可以种上树，种上农作物。水平沟也是如此。这样，三至五年就可能把成本全部收回。小型水库作成了，就可以马上进行灌溉、养鱼。再如搞沟洫台田，要牺牲三分之一土地，但这三分之一的沟洫内可以种芦苇、莲藕、养鱼，收获的要比损失的大的多。过去，我们搞大型工程就没有考虑如何和当前生产结合起来的问题。修官厅水库考虑了防洪、发电作用，修成后，现在养的鱼每年收入等于水库淹地减少收入的三倍。由于蓄了水，水库周围地下水位提高了，还可种水稻，增加产量。
    根据治理漭河经验，其他河道是否可就一、二支流集中治理呢？是否可先支（流）后干（流）、先小后大呢？凡是山区的县都要抓这一点，搞个小支流创造经验。到了明年，我们的经验就更多了。没有自己的经验，决心就不会大，我们要亲自动手去搞。农闲大干，农忙小干，大忙暂停。当然，这样搞，也不是说每条都能治好。失败是成功之母，今年失败，明年再来，终会成功的。“四、五、八”的指标完全能实现
    谭震林说，中共中央1956年1月提出的，经过两年来的实践之后，现在修正和公布的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），是我国社会主义建设中发展农业的纲领。它有两个中心关键，一是在我国的三种不同地区，到1967年分别实现亩产粮食四百、五百、八百斤，二是储备粮食，以备紧急时候的需要。有些同志顾虑“四、五、八”的要求能否实现，但事实上，1956年全国有十九个县已经达到了这项指标，广东省去年就有八个县达到了这项指标。而今年广东省的汕头专区十七个县、市已达八百斤以上，其中有六个县已达千斤，90％以上的农业生产合作社达到了亩产八百斤以上。实现“四、五、八”的要求，是完全可能的。这仅是一个方向，划一道杠杠，要求亩产四百斤的地区，有些也可能达到五百斤、八百斤。河南省的孟县去年就达到了纲要的要求，济源县还有亩产两千斤粮和两万斤菜的典型经验。我们要巩固和发展这样的成绩，并推广这样的经验。由于农业合作化高潮推动了农业生产的发展，现在农村有20％——30％的农户有储备粮。我国的粮食现在还是不宽裕的，节约并储备粮食极其重要。勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家是我们建设社会主义的方针，而勤俭持家则是基础，因此必须广泛宣传，认真贯彻。甘肃定西专区的农业生产合作社，一般都有半年的储备粮，一年的种籽，一年的牲口饲草。他们那里是一个干旱地区，其水源的缺乏，储水的不易，堪称全国第一。可是，他们就是把一块一块的冰和一篓一篓的雪，储放在水窖之内，解决了浇水点种、保苗和人畜吃水的问题，保证了农业的发展。定西地委搞水利的口号是：每个干部准备少活十年，也要战胜干旱。甘肃省委认为他们搞水利的口号是好的，已向全省干部发出同样的号召，今年全省要搞两万平方公里的水土保持。现在，全国农业发展纲要修正草案已经提交全国人民讨论，各地要热烈组织这场辩论。从省、专区到县、区、乡、社都要根据纲要的精神，结合本地情况，做出自己的规划，省、专、县要于明年5月完成这项重要工作。
        “肥料就是粮食”
    谭震林在指出“肥料就是粮食”，必须加强积肥工作以后，接着说：开展山区的水土保持，与植树造林绿化我们的祖国、发展多种经济是紧密相连的。只要有决心有劲头，在一个小范围内一年即可基本解决水土保持问题。在改良盐碱沙荒方面，河南省也有了成功的经验，要做出规划，在一定时间内完成这一任务。关于农业机械化问题，他说，我们要积极发展农业机械的生产，大力推广新式农具。但是，更要注意改良现有的旧农具。到第三个五年计划还是以改良旧农具为主。推广先进经验，是建设社会主义的重要力量。河南省在农业增产上有许多好经验，如一个一个地推广开来，对增产的作用则是不可估量的。劳动人民每日每时都有发明创造，都有先进经验的出现，因此推广先进经验的工作必须经常化。
