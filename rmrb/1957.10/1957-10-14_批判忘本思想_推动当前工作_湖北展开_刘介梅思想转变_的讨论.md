　　Criticize the Thought of Forgetting One's Roots and Promote Current Work
    Hubei Launches Discussion on "Liu Jiemei's Ideological Transformation"
    (Our report) The discussion on "Liu Jiemei's Ideological Transformation" is gradually deepening in many areas of the province since the CPC Hubei Provincial Committee issued a notice to various places on September 12. Participating in this discussion are the broad masses of township and commune cadres, Party and League members, and activists; famous labor models; workers in local industry and handicrafts; office cadres and cadres in financial and economic departments; and teachers and students. Through discussion, they have all linked their own experiences to criticize the thought of forgetting one's roots and capitalist thought, greatly enhancing their socialist consciousness and promoting current production and work.

    Many people who originally had thoughts similar to Liu Jiemei's have begun to transform, and many cadres who originally had thoughts of retreating have also expressed their determination to continue the revolution to the end. In Hanchuan County, after the discussion on Liu Jiemei's ideological transformation among more than 7,300 township and commune cadres in 39 townships, 123 of the original 143 people with thoughts similar to Liu Jiemei's have been transformed through recalling the past, comparing, and calculating accounts in detail. At a meeting of 178 Party members in Xinlong District of Hanyang, 41 Party members examined and overcame their thoughts of retreating. Zhang Kunchang, deputy township head of Tiefu Township, who had been a hired laborer for 20 years, originally wanted to apply to quit being a cadre and engage in speculative business to exploit others. Now, he sorrowfully examined himself and said, "I have forgotten my roots. If it weren't for the Party saving me, I would have almost fallen into the capitalist quagmire!" In addition, famous labor models Guan Musheng, Rao Xingli, Cai Yitian, etc. also participated in this discussion and expressed their willingness to lead the commune members well in conducting the discussion seriously.

    Some counties have also launched discussions on the ideological transformation of Liu Jiemei among office cadres, workers, and teachers. At a discussion meeting of more than 30 workers at the Hao Xuezhen Oil Factory in Jiangling, driver Tan Renxiang recalled the painful life of begging for food and suffering from the cold in the past and said, "The current life is many times better than in the past! Thanks to the Party's education, I have become an advanced producer in production and a model twice in learning. This is something I couldn't have dreamed of in the past." Liu Hanwen, chairman of the trade union, also expressed his determination to overcome the idea of not wanting to be a trade union cadre, overcome difficulties, and do a better job more actively. After the discussion, more than 30 Party member cadres of the handicraft cooperative in Songbu Town, Macheng, formulated a plan to ensure the repair of agricultural tools to support farmers in carrying out the large-scale winter planting and production. Teachers of Chengguan Primary School and Zhengcheng No. 4 Primary School in Daye County seriously studied the materials on Liu Jiemei's ideological transformation and unanimously expressed that under the Party's education, they will strengthen ideological transformation, stand firm in the current anti-Rightist struggle, and completely smash the Rightist elements.

　　批判忘本思想  推动当前工作
    湖北展开“刘介梅思想转变”的讨论
    本报讯　“刘介梅思想转变”的讨论，从9月12日中共湖北省委向各地发出通知后，目前正在全省许多地区逐步深入展开。参加这次讨论的有广大乡社干部、党团员、积极分子；有著名的劳动模范；有地方工业和手工业工人；有机关干部和财经部门干部；还有教员、学生。他们通过讨论，都联系自己批判了忘本思想和资本主义思想，大大提高了社会主义觉悟，推动了当前各项生产和工作。
    许多原来有类似刘介梅思想的人，都开始转变过来，许多原来有退坡思想的干部也表示要革命到底。汉川县三十九个乡的七千三百多个乡社干部，经过刘介梅思想转变讨论后，原来一百四十三个有类似刘介梅思想的人，通过回忆对比算细账，现在已有一百二十三人转变过来。在汉阳新隆区有一百七十八个党员参加的大会上，有四十一个党员检查克服了退坡思想。曾经当过二十年长工的铁铺乡副乡长张坤长，原来想申请不当干部，去搞投机生意，剥削别人，现在他沉痛地检查说：“我忘本了，要不是党挽救我，我险些掉进资本主义泥坑中去了！”此外，著名劳动模范官木生、饶兴礼、蔡以田等也都参加了这个讨论，并表示要很好领导社员认真地讨论好。
    部分县在机关干部、工人、教员中也展开了刘介梅思想转变的讨论。江陵郝穴镇油厂职工三十多人的讨论会上，司机谭仁祥回忆过去讨饭受冻的痛苦生活后说：“现在的日子比起过去不知高了多少倍！由于党的教育，生产上我当上了先进生产者，学习上我当上了两次模范，这是过去做梦也想不到的事。”工会主席刘汉文并表示要克服不愿当工会干部的思想，克服困难，更积极地搞好工作。麻城宋埠镇手工业社三十多个党员干部，讨论后订出了保证修理好农具的计划，以支援农民开展冬播大生产。大冶县城关小学和郑城四中小学部的教师，都认真学习了刘介梅思想转变的材料，一致表示要在党的教育下，加强思想改造，在当前反右派斗争中，站稳立场，彻底粉碎右派分子。
