Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 5th: After half a month of fighting drought and rushing to plant, Shandong Province has sown over thirty million mu of wheat on the extremely arid land, accounting for about half of this year's plan.

Currently, the province-wide movement to combat drought and plant wheat is continuing to develop towards a climax. The labor attendance rate in agricultural cooperatives in various places is generally above 90%. Agricultural cooperatives in Zhaoyuan, Pingyuan, and other counties, in order to save time, have adopted the method of watering and planting in shifts day and night, creating a grand production upsurge scene of "waterwheels and winches turning together during the day, and lights all over the mountains and fields at night."

During this drought resistance movement, the secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the heads of Party committees at all levels have gone deep into the fields to fight the drought alongside the vast number of cadres and peasants, giving great encouragement to the masses. Since late September, cadres from the directly affiliated organizations of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and various departments of Jinan City have been sending thousands of people every day to help farmers in the suburbs fight the drought and rush to plant. Some officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jinan and some students from universities and colleges also went to the countryside to help farmers fight the drought during the National Day holiday.

    山东已播种冬麦三千多万亩
    据新华社济南5日电　经过半个月的抗旱抢种，山东省已经在异常干旱的土地上播种下三千多万亩小麦，约占今年计划的一半。
    现在，全省范围的抗旱种麦运动正继续向高潮发展，各地农业社的劳动出勤率一般都在90％以上。招远、平原等县的农业社，为了争取时间，采取日夜轮班浇水抢种的办法，出现了“白天水车辘轳一齐转，夜晚满山遍野灯一片”的大生产高潮景象。
    在这次抗旱运动中，中共山东省委书记及各级党委的负责人都深入田间，同广大干部和农民一起并肩抗旱，给群众以很大鼓舞。中共山东省委直属机关和济南市各机关单位的干部，9月下旬以来每天都抽出数千人帮助郊区农民抗旱抢种。中国人民解放军驻济南部队的部分官兵和各大、专院校的部分学生，在国庆休假期间也下乡帮助农民抗旱。
