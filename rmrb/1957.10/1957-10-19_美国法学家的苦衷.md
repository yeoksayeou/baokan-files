　　The Distress of American Jurists

　　After the Soviet Union successfully launched its first artificial Earth satellite, the American jurist Haley, hailed by the United Press as "one of the few space law experts," suddenly solemnly suggested to the International Astronautical Congress that space travelers should be prohibited from landing on other planets unless they are invited to land. Mr. Haley also said that he intends to suggest to the conference that the moon be declared a "free and independent autonomous region."

　　It is indeed surprising that this "jurist" who serves the American policy of aggression, is actually concerned about the sovereignty of the moon and other planets.

　　People know that American imperialists have never respected the sovereignty of any country on Earth; Dulles has even published the argument that "sovereignty is an outdated concept." Moreover, American imperialists not only have desires against other countries on Earth, but also have a strong desire to plunder other planets in the universe. Two years ago, more than one person in the United States declared himself the owner of the moon and openly sold land on the moon. Now, this American jurist has suddenly made this wonderful argument on the issue of sovereignty over other planets. What is the purpose of this?

　　Clear-sighted people can see that Mr. Haley's wonderful argument has other intentions; he is only subtly and vividly conveying the American ruling group's unavoidable distress. This distress was revealed in a dispatch from the United Press. The dispatch from Barcelona, the venue of the International Astronautical Congress, stated that scientists unanimously believe that nothing can prevent the Soviet Union from becoming the winner in the race to land an object on the moon. … A first-class American scientist here briefly explained the American attitude. He said: "...The war to win the hearts of the world is the most important war we will fight. Because of the Soviet satellite, we have lost more hearts than ever before."

　　The problem is very clear. If the Soviet Union achieves brilliant achievements in interstellar travel again, the United States will lose more "hearts," and America's "deterrent power" will be even more worthless. What troubles Haley and his gang of imperialist strategists is that Soviet science will certainly surpass the United States in interstellar travel. Therefore, they have to use such absurd ideas as "no landing on other planets without invitation" and "declaring the moon a free and independent autonomous region" to "constrain" the Soviet Union, vainly attempting to prevent the Soviet Union from first achieving success in interstellar travel.

　　So, this is what the American jurist is really thinking. (Travel)

### 美国法学家的苦衷

　　美国法学家的苦衷
    被合众社誉为“为数很少的空间法专家之一”的美国法学家哈莱，在苏联成功地发射出第一个人造地球卫星之后，忽然郑重其事地向国际星际航行会议建议：应当禁止空间旅行者在别的星球上登陆，除非他们是应邀着陆。这位哈莱先生并且说，他打算向会议建议宣布月亮为“自由和独立的自治地区”。
    为美国侵略政策服务的这位“法学家”居然关心起月亮和其他星球的主权问题，这确实是使人惊异的。
    人们知道，美国帝国主义分子从来就不尊重地球上的任何国家的主权的；杜勒斯就发表过“主权是过了时的观念”的论调。而且，美国帝国主义分子不仅是对地球上的其他国家，就是对宇宙间的其他星球也是怀着强烈的掠夺的欲望的。前两年在美国就有不止一人宣布自己是月亮的所有主，并且公开出售月亮上的土地。现在，而是美国的这位法学家忽然在对其他星球的主权问题上发出了这番妙论，这是为了什么呢？
    明眼人都可以看出，哈莱先生的妙论是别有企图的；他不过是微妙入神地传达了美国统治集团的不得已的苦衷罢了。这番苦衷在合众社的一则电讯中被透露出来了。这则从国际星际航行会议的所在地巴塞罗那发出的电讯说，科学家一致认为，没有东西可以阻止苏联在把一个物体降落在月亮上的比赛中成为优胜者。……美国一位第一流的科学家在这里扼要地说明了美国人的态度。他说：“……争取世界人心的战争是我们将进行的最重要的战争。由于苏联的卫星，我们所失去的人心比过去任何时候都要多。”
    问题很清楚，如果苏联再在星际旅行方面取得光辉成就，美国就要失去更多的“人心”，美国的“威慑力量”就要更加一文不值。而令哈莱这一班帝国主义谋士们苦恼的是，苏联的科学又肯定地会在星际旅行方面超过美国，因此，就只好用“非经邀请不得着陆其他星球”和“宣布月亮为自由独立的自治地区”这类非非之想来“约束”苏联，妄想阻止苏联首先取得星际旅行的成就。
    美国法学家的用心原来是如此这般。  （旅）
