　　The Great Debate Has a Profound Impact
　　Wujin's Rural Work is Flourishing
　　Grain Purchase Quotas are Exceeded, Production Enthusiasm is Greatly Increased

　　(Our Newspaper News) Since Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, launched a socialist great debate in the countryside, a new socialist upsurge has begun to appear, and all work has shown a flourishing new atmosphere.

　　The county launched a comprehensive socialist great debate in the countryside in early August. In a month, more than 80% of the adults in the county have received a profound socialist education. According to the statistics of the Second Cooperative of Qianhuang Township, 82.4% of the adults participated in the debate, and generally participated in three or four debates.

　　Through the debate, first of all, the rural party members and cadres recognized the rural situation and improved their work enthusiasm. The First Cooperative of Henglin Township had only thirty party members in total, including the secretary and deputy secretary of the branch. Originally, fourteen party members did not want to work. After this education, they overcame their previous negative and tired emotions and actively led the masses to carry out socialist debates. Middle and poor peasants understood the major issues of right and wrong on the grain issue. Many people examined their individualistic thoughts and exposed the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. Lu Hezhong, a poor peasant in the First Cooperative of Hekou Township, originally made trouble about grain. After the debate, he realized that he had been fooled by a rich peasant and expressed his determination to stand firm. Most of the well-to-do middle peasants also chose their own path in the two roads after the debate, expressing that they would stay in the cooperative with peace of mind.

　　The great ideological harvest of the peasants has greatly promoted the progress of various tasks. First of all, the cooperatives have been consolidated and developed. More than 900 individual households in the county have applied to join the cooperatives, and fifteen elementary cooperatives have already or are applying to be upgraded to advanced cooperatives. The 327 production teams in Mingfeng District have gradually changed their backward appearance.

　　On the grain issue, this year's delivery of public grain and unified purchase tasks have been completed 129%; as soon as the early soybeans went on the market, 76.7% of the unified purchase task of soybeans was completed by the 25th; a habit of careful calculation and saving grain has begun to form among the peasants, and the grain sales in the third quarter have been reduced by more than 4 million catties compared with the original plan.

　　A new scene has also appeared in production. The peasants in the county actively participated in drought resistance, drainage, and strengthening field management. For example, in the Sixth Team of the Second Cooperative of Xiaohe Township, sixteen mu of rice fell in the field. After the rain stopped in the middle of the night, the cooperative members got up to dig and cut the rice and bring it to the field. A comprehensive bumper harvest is in sight this autumn, and now they are actively preparing for the autumn harvest and autumn planting.

    大辩论发生了深刻影响
    武进农村工作蒸蒸日上
    征购粮任务超额完成　生产积极性大大提高
    本报讯　江苏省武进县农村里经过了一场社会主义大辩论以后，已开始出现了一个新的社会主义高潮，各项工作都出现了蒸蒸日上的新气象。
    该县在8月上旬开始，在农村开展了全面的社会主义大辩论，一月来，全县80％以上的成年人都受到一次深刻的社会主义教育，据前黄乡二社的统计，参加辩论会的成年人占82.4％，一般都参加过三、四次辩论会。
    经过辩论，首先是农村党员和干部认清了农村的形势，工作劲头提高了，横林乡一社总共只有三十个党员，包括正、副支部书记在内，原有十四个党员不想干工作，经过这次教育，克服了以前消沉疲塌的情绪，并积极地领导群众开展社会主义的辩论。中贫农、下中农弄清了粮食问题上的大是大非，不少人检讨了个人主义思想，揭发了地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏活动。河口乡一社贫农陆和忠原来闹粮，经过辩论后，才觉悟到自己上了富农的当，表示要站稳立场。多数富裕中农也在辩论后，在两条道路中选择了自己的道路，表示要安心留在社里。
    农民在思想上获得的大丰收，大大推动了各项工作的前进。首先是合作社得到了巩固和发展，全县已有九百多单干户要求入社，十五个初级社已经或正在申请升为高级社。鸣凤区有三百二十七个生产队已逐渐改变了落后的面貌。
    在粮食问题上，今年交公粮和统购的任务完成了129％；早黄豆刚上场，到25日就完成黄豆统购任务的76.7％；在农民中已经开始形成了精打细算，节约吃粮的风气，第三季度销粮比原计划减少四百多万斤。
    生产上也同时出现了新的景象，全县农民积极地参加了抗旱、排涝、加强田间管理，如小河乡二社六队有十六亩稻倒伏在田里，半夜雨停后，社员就起来刨割上场，今年秋季的全面大丰收已胜利在望，现又在积极做好各项准备工作迎接秋收秋种。
