　　Ruthless Struggle and Ruthless Reform
　　Bu Xing
    In the struggle against the bourgeois rightists, we advocate ruthlessness. Without ruthlessness, we cannot defeat the rightists; it would be sentimentalism. In the rectification of the work styles of bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and in the improvement of our work, we also advocate ruthlessness. Without ruthlessness, these bad styles cannot be overcome, and our work cannot move forward; it would also be sentimentalism. Towards the enemy, struggle ruthlessly; towards bad styles, reform ruthlessly. Ruthless struggle and ruthless reform are two closely linked rings in our rectification and anti-rightist movement.
    Ruthless struggle without ruthless reform will not sustain and consolidate the masses' fighting spirit, which is detrimental to the cause of socialism. To reform ruthlessly, we must struggle ruthlessly. Without ruthless struggle, ruthless reform is impossible. If you want to reform, the rightists will disrupt you; how can you reform? You say wash your face, and they say cut off your head! You say rectification, and they shout, "Step down!" In short, you are taking the socialist road, and they are taking the capitalist road. Those who travel different paths cannot plan together. If you want to reform but cannot, you must struggle.
    Whenever the word "ruthless" is mentioned, some people think of ferocity and brutality. However, for the Communist Party and the proletariat, this is not the case at all. When we say "ruthless," it is the abbreviation of resolute and thorough. Here, ruthlessness has no necessary connection with ferocity. Therefore, in the anti-rightist struggle, we adopt the method of presenting the facts and reasoning things out. We advocate convincing people with reason. We must conduct in-depth criticism and thorough refutation of the rightists, hitting their vital points, so that they are rendered speechless and can only bow their heads and confess their guilt in the face of facts and truth. For rectifying work styles and improving work, we treat the opinions of the masses with the same spirit of seeking truth from facts. After specific analysis and careful study, we accept what should be accepted and explain what should be explained. We oppose both accepting everything indiscriminately and ignoring everything, and even more oppose retaliation. We do not allow ferocity and brutality towards the masses, nor can we be ferocious and brutal in improving our work. Otherwise, it will be formalism, reform without progress. Here, our task is to concentrate the wisdom of the masses and persevere! To make the improvement of work like a bond, tying the Party and the masses together, connecting them more closely and uniting them more firmly. This is our understanding of ruthlessness.
    The rightists once said: "You originally said you were rectifying the work style, but in the end, you ruthlessly rectified us!"
    We have never given up rectification, and we advocate rectifying and reforming simultaneously. We must both struggle ruthlessly and reform ruthlessly. Ruthless struggle is for the magnificent cause of the proletariat and the working people, and we do not allow anyone to infringe upon it. Ruthless reform is also for socialism and communism, so that it can develop more smoothly. Because we are revolutionaries and communists, we have no mercy for the enemies who undermine the socialist cause and must struggle ruthlessly! At the same time, we have no attachment to bad work styles that are incompatible with communists and must reform ruthlessly. As a result of our ruthless struggle, we have already achieved a great victory on the anti-rightist front. Although ruthless reform has just begun, it has already shown brilliant results. For example, the number of cadres in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has been reduced by 55%; Beijing has decided to transfer 30% to 50% of administrative and enterprise management personnel to the rural areas, construction sites, and other labor fronts; about 200,000 cadres nationwide have been sent down to the grassroots level, and 100,000 cadres have been sent down to production posts.
    This specifically embodies our revolutionary spirit in rectifying work styles and improving work, and demonstrates our resoluteness and thoroughness! This is what we mean by ruthless reform. Isn't this another resounding slap in the face for the rightists?

　　狠斗与狠改
　　卜星
    对资产阶级右派的斗争，我们主张狠，不狠，就不能打垮右派，就是温情主义；对官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义歪风的整顿和工作的改进，我们也主张狠，不狠，歪风不能克服，工作不能前进，也是温情主义。对敌人，狠斗，对歪风，狠改。狠斗与狠改，是我们整风、反右派运动中的两个紧密相联的环子。
    狠斗不狠改，群众斗志不能持续和巩固，于社会主义事业不利。要狠改，必须狠斗，不狠斗就不可能狠改，你要改，右派分子给你捣乱，如何改？你说洗脸，他说杀头！你说整风，他喊下台！总之，你走社会主义，他走资本主义，道不同，不相谋，欲改不成，非斗不可。
    一提到狠，有些人便想到凶，便想到粗暴。可是，狠对于共产党、无产阶级说来，却完全不是这么回事，我们说狠，就是坚决和彻底的缩写。在这里，狠与凶没有必然联系。因此，反右斗争，我们采取摆事实、讲道理的方法，我们主张以理服人，对右派分子要进行深入地批判、彻底地驳斥，击中其要害，使其在事实和真理面前，理屈词穷，只有低头认罪。对整顿作风、改进工作，同样以实事求是的精神对待群众的意见，经过具体地分析，认真地研究，该接受的接受，该解释的解释，既反对一揽子包下来，也反对置之不理，更反对打击报复，我们对群众，不允许凶和暴，对改进工作，也不能凶和暴，否则，就是形式主义，改而不进。在这里我们的任务，就是将群众的智慧集中起来，坚持下去！使改进工作像一条纽带，它把党和群众纽结在一起，联系得更紧，团结得更牢。这就是我们对狠的理解。
    右派分子曾经说：原说你们整风，结果却狠狠的整到我们头上来了！
    我们从来没有放弃整风，而且主张边整边改。我们既要狠斗，又要狠改，狠斗是为了无产阶级、劳动人民的壮丽的事业，不容许任何人对它侵犯；狠改也是为了社会主义和共产主义，使它得到更顺利的发展。因为我们是革命者、共产党人，对破坏社会主义事业的敌人，毫不容情，必须狠斗！同时，对与共产党人不能相容的坏作风，也毫不留恋，必须狠改。由于我们狠斗的结果，在反右战线上，已经取得了伟大的胜利。关于狠改，虽然刚在开始，可是业已出现了光辉的成绩。例如：石景山钢铁厂干部精简了55％；北京市决定从行政管理人员和企业管理人员中抽调30％—50％到农村、工地等劳动战线上去；全国约有二十万干部下放到基层，十万干部下放到生产岗位。
    这就具体地体现了我们在整顿作风、改进工作上的革命精神，表现了我们的坚决和彻底！这就是我们所说的狠改。这样，不是又给右派分子一个响亮的耳光吗？
