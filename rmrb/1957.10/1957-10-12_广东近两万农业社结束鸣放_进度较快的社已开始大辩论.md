　　(Report from this newspaper) Nearly 20,000 agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province have basically concluded the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" stage and are preparing to fully launch major debates. In some cooperatives in the Zhanjiang, Shantou, and Foshan special districts, which have progressed faster, members have enthusiastically plunged into the upsurge of major debates. As these cooperatives transition to major debates, the remaining 40,000 cooperatives will also fully launch the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" stage.

　　The biggest difficulty encountered by this batch of cooperatives in Guangdong Province during the "Blooming" stage was the reluctance of a few wealthier middle peasants to boldly express their opinions due to concerns; while some leading cadres were simplistic in their approach and sought quick results. The "Blooming" stage in most cooperatives in Guangdong Province unfolded after gradually overcoming these difficulties. After dispelling their ideological concerns, many wealthier middle peasants put forward their specific proposals. Some wealthier middle peasants living in Sha Long Village of Yongning Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongshan County said during the "Blooming" stage that they had already discussed selecting a group of people with good land and strong labor to form one cooperative, and not wanting anyone with poor land and weak labor. Some people demanded "contracting production to individual households," and some even said: "One household per cooperative would be best." However, the vast majority of poor peasant members firmly opposed these opinions during the "Blooming" stage. Major debates will be展开ed on these issues. In some areas within the province, due to the simplistic and impatient emotions of cadres and other reasons, the "Blooming" stage was not broad or deep enough, and especially some wealthier middle peasants still had many thoughts that they did not express. These areas plan to remedy this after transitioning to the debate stage.

　　Many cooperatives that have already launched major debates have been able to carry out the debates smoothly and improve the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers because they made full preparations before the debates and adhered to the principles of democratic debate and persuading people with reason during the debates. The Datong Cooperative in Yangjiang County had special personnel responsible for preparing materials in advance and notified the debate participants to prepare well, so the debates were very active, and 97% of the poor peasants distinguished right from wrong on the main issues, and the wealthier middle peasants who were criticized also expressed their heartfelt agreement. After the Dajing Cooperative in Dapu County held 250 large and small debate meetings, the phenomenon of some members abandoning agriculture for commerce and agitating for division of the cooperative has stopped, and the members have expressed their willingness to do a good job in production and strive to sell more grain in the autumn, and topdressing fertilizer has also been applied to the more than 200 mu of "third-class rice" fields.

　　In the past few days, local party committees have convened "battlefield" meetings to summarize the experience of the previous stage of the "Blooming" work, and to help cadres correct simplistic and impatient emotions and erroneous ideas such as fearing that they would not be able to refute wrong arguments. In many areas of Zhanjiang and Foshan special districts, cadres were first mobilized to debate the opinions expressed by the masses, and ideological training was conducted before organizing the masses to conduct major debates. Some cooperatives in Dianbai and Lianjiang counties also organized propaganda teams to widely explain to the masses the different boundaries between internal debates among the people and struggles against the enemy, in order to dispel the concerns of wealthy middle peasants about participating in the debates.

　　While brewing major debates, various localities have also paid attention to improving their work. The BoLuo County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Committee recently made a decision to rectify and improve work simultaneously, organizing cadres from subordinate organs and enterprises to go to the countryside to listen to the opinions of the masses and improve the work of their departments. Yangchun County has also established an organization to improve work and formulated a plan for improving work. Therefore, many farmers who previously believed that "making suggestions is useless" and "repeating old tunes" now say "there is thunder and rain," and "the blooming is useful." Cadres of the Datiecun Cooperative in Suixi County improved their work style based on mass criticism and cleared the accounts, after which 95% of the adults in the entire cooperative actively participated in the debate meetings.

### 广东近两万农业社结束鸣放  进度较快的社已开始大辩论

　　广东近两万农业社结束鸣放  进度较快的社已开始大辩论
    本报讯　广东省近两万个农业社已经基本结束大鸣大放，准备全面展开大辩论。进度较快的湛江、汕头、佛山专区的部分社的社员已经热情奔放地投入大辩论的热潮中。在这批社转入大辩论时，其余四万个社也将全面开展大鸣大放。
    广东省这批社在进行鸣放中碰到的最大困难是少数富裕中农有顾虑不敢大胆鸣放；不少领导干部却简单从事、急躁图快。广东省多数社的鸣放，是逐渐克服了这些困难以后展开的。不少富裕中农在消除思想顾虑后，提出他们的具体主张。中山县永宁农业社住在沙垅村的有些富裕中农在鸣放时说，他们已经商量好，要挑选一批土地好和劳动力强的人组织一个社，土地瘦和劳动力弱的人一个也不要。有的人要求“包产到户”，有的甚至说：“一户一个社最好”。但是绝大多数贫农社员在鸣放时却坚决反对这些意见。关于这些问题都将展开大辩论。省内还有一部分地区由于干部存在简单急躁的情绪和别的原因，鸣放的不够广不够深，特别是一部分富裕中农还有不少心里话没有说出来。这些地区准备在转入辩论后加以补救。
    已经展开大辩论的许多合作社，由于在辩论前做了充分准备，辩论时又坚持了民主争辩、以理服人的原则，因而使辩论得以顺利开展，广大农民的社会主义觉悟也有了提高。阳江县大同社事先由专人专责准备材料，并通知辩论对象作好准备，因而争辩起来很活跃，97％的贫农都在主要问题上分清了是非，受到批判的富裕中农也表示口服心服。大埔县大靖社举行了二百五十次大小辩论会以后，部分社员弃农就商和闹分社的现象已经停止，社员们都表示要搞好生产，争取秋季多卖粮食，二百多亩“三类禾”的地里也施了追肥。
    这几天，各地党委都召开了“战地”会议，总结了前一阶段的鸣放工作经验，帮助干部纠正了简单急躁情绪和害怕驳不倒错误言论等错误思想。湛江、佛山专区的许多地区，还就群众鸣放出来的意见，首先发动干部进行辩论，进行思想练兵，然后才组织群众队伍进行大辩论。电白、廉江县有些社还组织了宣传队伍，向群众广泛解释人民内部争辩和对敌斗争的不同界限，以消除富裕中农参加辩论的顾虑。
    在酝酿大辩论的同时，各地还注意了改进工作。中共博罗县委和人民委员会最近作出了边整边改的决定，组织所属机关、企业单位的干部到农村听取群众意见，改进本部门的工作。阳春县也成立了改进工作的机构，订出有关改进工作的方案。因此，许多过去认为“提意见不顶事”、“老调重弹”的农民，现在都说“有雷声也有雨点了”、“鸣放顶用了”。遂溪县打铁村社干部，根据群众批评改进了工作作风，清理了账目之后，全社有95％的成年人都积极参加了辩论会。
