Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Strasbourg: The chairman of the Western European Union Assembly, Hutchison, said at the opening meeting of the assembly's autumn session on the 10th that the possible consequences of the Soviet Union's launching of an artificial satellite are "unthinkable," and "this makes it even more necessary and more important to reach an agreement on disarmament."
He said that the opponent the West is now facing is clearly more talented, effective, and persevering than some people have hitherto believed. He called on Western European countries to "strengthen unity" to cope with the new situation.
Delegates attending the meeting admitted that the successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite has placed the West in the position of a failed competitor.
The chairman of the Western European Union Defense Committee, Dutch parliamentarian I.E. Veenstra, called on the West to do everything possible to regain the "leading position" it has lost. He said, "I am worried about the impact this will have on small countries and neutral countries. They will say that they will not follow the West." He admitted that the importance of the West has diminished.
Kenneth Younger, who served as Minister of State in the previous British Labor Cabinet, said that this proves that the Soviet Union "is clearly in a leading position and not just catching up with what the West has already created." In order to encourage the delegates, Younger urged them not to be "too alarmed."

    望着苏联人造卫星
    西欧联盟议会惊惶不安
    新华社11日讯　斯特拉斯堡消息：西欧联盟议会主席哈契逊10日在这个议会的秋季常会开幕会议上说，苏联发射人造卫星可能产生的后果是“不堪设想”的，“这使得更加需要和更加应该就裁军问题达成协议了。”
    他说，现在西方所面临的对手显然比某些人迄今所认为的更加有才能、有效和有毅力。他要求西欧各国“加强团结”，以应付新的局势。
    出席会议的代表们承认，苏联发射人造卫星成功，使西方处于一个竞争失败者的地位。
    西欧联盟防务委员会主席荷兰议员伊·伊·费恩斯要求西方尽一切力量夺回业已丧失的“领先地位”。他说，“我担心这对小国和中立国的影响。它们将要说，它们要不跟西方走了。”他承认西方的重要性已经降低了。
    在上届英国工党内阁担任国务大臣的肯尼思·杨格说，这证明，苏联“明显地处在领先地位而不只是追上西方已经制造出来的东西。”为了替代表们打气，杨格要求他们不要“过于惊惶”。
