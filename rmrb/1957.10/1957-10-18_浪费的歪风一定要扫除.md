　　The Evil Trend of Waste Must Be Eliminated
　　Chen Pu

　　Living a life of diligence and thrift is the long-standing family management experience and fine tradition of our working people. However, in recent years, with the development of production and the improvement of living standards, many people have forgotten this good experience and good tradition. In many places, especially in rich harvest areas and economic crop areas, the bad habit of extravagance and waste is gradually growing. In the process of the great debate, it is necessary to mobilize the peasants to clarify the rights and wrongs of this issue.

　　Why have some peasants changed so quickly from the habit of saving and economizing during the difficult times of the past, and are now willing to spend money lavishly and waste large amounts of food? There is an ideological problem here. Some people think that now that it is advanced collectivization and production has increased, there must be a major improvement in living standards. It is not wrong to demand an improvement in living standards. The fundamental purpose of the Communist Party leading the peasants on the socialist road is to make all peasants live an increasingly prosperous and happy life. The problem is that these people want to reach the sky in one step in terms of improving their lives. They do not understand the difference between a normal improvement in living standards and extravagance and waste under the current conditions. It is very important to make these people understand the difference between the two. They should be patiently told that excessively and unrealistically pursuing living consumption without considering the level of production development and the degree of income growth exceeds the boundary of legitimate improvement in living standards and becomes waste. As for some people spending large sums of money on superstitious activities such as burning incense and worshiping temples, and building beautiful tombs, this kind of practice that has nothing to do with improving life is an unacceptable waste at any time. Due to its inherent advantages, agricultural cooperatives can increase production relatively quickly, but it generally takes three to five years to become relatively wealthy. It can be seen that even after joining an advanced cooperative, one cannot be impatient about improving one's life.

　　Some peasants also have the idea of relying on the collective for everything. They believe that after joining the cooperative, they don't need to pay attention to saving. If they have difficulties, they can ask the cooperative or the government to solve them. These peasants should be educated to dispel their selfish ideas of only caring about themselves and not caring about the cooperative and the country, and to treat the relationship between individuals and the collective and the country with a correct attitude.

　　In the past, in the distribution of income in cooperatives, attention was paid to deducting less and distributing more, so that peasants who had just realized collectivization could quickly increase their income. This was beneficial to improving the enthusiasm of the members and consolidating the newly established cooperatives. However, in order to further expand production, this situation needs to be appropriately changed. In this year's autumn harvest distribution, many cooperatives paid attention to correctly handling the relationship between internal accumulation and consumption, leaving as much funds as possible for expanded reproduction. This approach is completely correct. At the same time, rural Party organizations and leading cadres of cooperatives also have the responsibility to regularly educate members on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and managing households diligently and thriftily. In every village, there are some farm families who still maintain the tradition of managing their households diligently and thriftily. Such peasants should be commended, and their saving methods and experience should be introduced more often to promote those who do not know how to live to learn from these thrifty families. After a great debate, Wannian and other counties in Jiangxi Province have generally established a new atmosphere of saving food. Agricultural cooperatives in Suining Prefecture, Sichuan Province, mobilized members to use the surplus grain saved to establish "righteous granaries." These facts show that as long as we strengthen ideological education and adopt practical and feasible saving methods, we can definitely eliminate the evil trend of waste and establish a new atmosphere of diligence and thrift.

　　浪费的歪风一定要扫除
　　沉浦
    过日子要勤俭，这是我国劳动人民长期以来的治家经验和优良传统。但是，近几年来，随着生产的发展和生活的改善，许多人把这个好经验、好传统忘掉了。在许多地方，特别是在丰收地区和经济作物地区，铺张浪费的坏风气正在逐渐滋长。在大辩论的过程中，有必要发动农民把这个问题的是非弄清楚。
    为什么有些农民会这样迅速地改变了过去艰难生活时期省吃俭用的习惯，居然舍得大把大把地花钱，大量地浪费粮食了呢？这里面有思想问题。一部分人的想法是：现在是高级合作化了，生产提高了，因此就得来一个生活大改善。要求改善生活并不错，共产党领导农民走社会主义道路，根本目的就是要使全体农民都过越来越富裕的幸福生活。问题是这些人想在改善生活上一步登天。他们不了解在目前的条件下，正常的改善生活同铺张浪费之间的区别。让这些人明白这两者的区别，是十分重要的。应该耐心地向他们说明不考虑生产发展水平和收入增长的程度，而过分地过高地追求生活消费，这就是超过了正当的改善生活的界限，而成为浪费了。至于某些人花大量金钱去从事烧香、拜庙等迷信活动，去修建漂亮的坟墓，这种与改善生活毫无关系的作法任何时候都是一种要不得的浪费。农业合作社由于它本身的优越性，虽然能够较快地增加生产，但是一般也需要三、五年的时间才能比较富裕。可见，即使是入了高级社，对于生活的改善，也不能犯急性病。
    还有些农民有着一种万事依靠集体的想法。他们认为入了社可以不注意节约了，有了困难，就找合作社或政府给解决。应该教育这些农民打消这种只顾自己不顾合作社和国家的自私自利思想，使他们用正确的态度去对待个人同集体和国家的关系。
    过去，在合作社的收益分配中，注意少扣多分，使刚刚实现合作化后的农民能够迅速地增加一些收入，这对提高社员的积极性和巩固新成立的合作社都是有好处的。但是，为了进一步地扩大生产，这种情况却需要作适当的改变。今年的秋收分配中，很多合作社都注意正确地处理社内积累和消费的关系，给扩大再生产留下尽可能多的资金，这种办法是完全正确的。同时农村党组织和合作社领导干部也有责任经常注意对社员进行勤俭办社和勤俭持家的教育。在每个村庄里，都有一些至今仍然保持着勤俭持家传统的农家，应该表扬这样的农民，并且多多介绍他们的节约办法和经验，推动那些不会过日子的人向这些勤俭人家学习。江西省万年等县经过大辩论后普遍树立了节约粮食的新风气；四川省遂宁专区的农业合作社动员社员用节约的余粮建立“义仓”。这些事实说明，只要加强思想教育，并且采取切实可行的节约办法，就一定可以扫除浪费的歪风，树立起勤俭的新风气。
