With Rectification and Reform, a Fresh New Look

During the rectification campaign, as the internal contradictions of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant were gradually resolved, a new production upsurge is taking shape. The plant is expected to produce more than 2,000 tons of pig iron, more than 1,000 tons of coke, and more than 200 tons of cast iron pipes in September than planned. At present, more than 73% of the problems raised by the workers of the plant during the rectification campaign have been resolved or are being resolved. This article introduces the plant's vigorous improvement of work and the new atmosphere that has emerged after the improvement of work.

	While carrying out rectification and reform, investigation was also carried out. The Party Branch Secretary and workshop director of the Casting Department are carefully inspecting the improved effect of the ingot car.

	The workers of the whole plant have truly achieved "rectification and production without delay." The young blast furnace workers performed particularly well in September. By the 27th, they had overproduced more than 300 tons of pig iron. This is the workers excitedly writing production reports.

	Qian Shixin, the repair foreman of the Casting Department, used to have simple and blunt working methods and had poor relations with the workers. Worker Chen Xi once said: "I can't work here with Old Qian." During the rectification movement, Qian Shixin conscientiously reviewed his shortcomings and greatly improved his relationship with the workers. This is Qian Shixin (right) and Chen Xi (left) boating and talking on the small lake in the factory area.

	The Opinion Answer Column proposes solutions and the names of the people responsible for dealing with the problems raised by the staff and workers. The picture shows the staff and workers carefully reading these answers.

    边整边改气象一新
    石景山钢铁厂职工在整风期间，由于企业内部矛盾的逐渐解决，新的生产高潮正在形成。全厂预计9月份可比计划增产两千多吨生铁、一千多吨焦炭和二百多吨铸铁管。目前，这个厂的职工在整风中提出的问题，已有73％以上得到解决或正在解决。这里介绍的是这个厂大力改进工作和改进工作之后出现的新气象。

    在进行边整边改的同时，还进行了边查。铸造部的党总支书记和车间主任正在认真检查改进后的元宝车的使用效果。
    全厂工人真正做到了“整风生产两不误”。青年高炉工人们在9月份的生产情况特别好。到27日已超额生产了三百吨以上的生铁。这是工人们正在兴奋地写生产捷报。
    铸造部修理工长钱士鑫过去工作方法简单生硬，和工人关系不好。工人陈喜曾说过：“老钱在这儿，我干不了”。整风运动中，钱士鑫认真检讨了自己的缺点，和工人的关系有很大改进，这是钱士鑫（右）和陈喜（左）在厂区里的小湖上划船谈心。
    意见解答栏上针对职工提出的问题，提出了解决的办法和负责处理人的姓名。图为职工们正在认真阅读这些解答。
