　　Syria Uncovers Another Subversive Organization
    National Socialist Party Colludes with the United States in Conspiracy to Launch Rebellion
    (Comprehensive report by this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Syrian military announced on the 10th that Syrian authorities recently discovered a new plot by imperialism directing the Syrian National Socialist Party to subvert the current Syrian government.
    A Syrian military spokesman said that security authorities in Latakia seized hundreds of new weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Investigations revealed that these weapons were intended by the already outlawed Syrian National Socialist Party to overthrow the current government and launch a rebellion.
    The spokesman said that a group of Syrian National Socialist Party members and others had been organized by the fugitive criminal Muhammad Marouf to go to Lebanon. They received weapons training in Syrian National Socialist Party training camps within Lebanese territory. During this period, they regularly received salaries from imperialists. After these individuals completed their combat and treasonous technical training, they were ordered to return to Latakia, and weapons were sent to them by land and sea. These weapons were hidden in caves, ready to be used at a decisive moment to kill peaceful citizens and overthrow the current regime.
    The spokesman said that the conspirators were prepared, in the event of their conspiracy failing, to use hidden weapons to launch a rebellion by any means possible, in order to overthrow the independent Syrian government.
    The spokesman pointed out that since the assassination of Syrian former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army Adnan al-Malki in 1955, the Syrian National Socialist Party has proven itself to be a tool of imperialism.
    Damascus newspapers on the 11th carried the news of the uncovering of the new American-orchestrated conspiracy and photos of the confiscated weapons under large headlines. Most newspapers also published editorials condemning the American imperialists and Syrian traitors.
    According to a report in the "Masses Daily" on the 12th, the weapons recently confiscated by Syrian authorities from the National Socialists in Latakia were American and Canadian weapons.

　　叙利亚又破获颠覆组织
    国家社会党勾通美国阴谋发动叛乱
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：叙利亚军方10日宣布，叙利亚当局最近发现了帝国主义指使叙利亚国家社会党进行颠覆叙利亚现政府的新阴谋。
    叙利亚军方发言人说，治安当局在拉塔基亚查获了几百件新式武器和几万发子弹。调查的结果表明，这些武器是已经被宣布非法的叙利亚国家社会党准备用来推翻现政府和发动叛乱的。
    这位发言人说，有一批叙利亚国家社会党党员和其他一些人，曾经被在逃的罪犯穆罕默德·马罗夫组织起来去黎巴嫩。他们在黎巴嫩境内的叙利亚国家社会党训练营中接受了使用武器的训练。在此期间，他们按期向帝国主义者领取薪金。在这些人完成了作战和叛国的技术训练后，他们奉命返回拉塔基亚，武器由陆路和水路送给他们。这些武器藏在山洞里，准备到决定性的时刻，用来杀害和平公民和推翻现政权。
    发言人说，阴谋分子准备在他们的阴谋万一失败时，尽一切可能办法用隐藏的武器来发动叛乱，以推翻独立的叙利亚政府。
    这位发言人指出，自从叙利亚前陆军副参谋长阿德南·马尔基在1955年被暗杀后，叙利亚国家社会党已经证明自己是帝国主义的工具。
    大马士革报纸11日以大字标题刊载了破获美国策划的新阴谋的消息和没收到的武器的照片。大多数报纸还发表了谴责美国帝国主义者和叙利亚叛徒的社论。
    据“群众报”12日报道，叙利亚当局最近在拉塔基亚从国家社会党人那里没收的武器是美国和加拿大武器。
