　　Resolutely Learn from the Advanced Medicine of the Soviet Union
　　Fu Lianzhang, Vice Minister of Public Health of the People's Republic of China, President of the Chinese Medical Association
    The great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union has been around for forty years. Over the past forty years, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and under the shining light of Marxism-Leninism, the Soviet people have achieved extremely great and brilliant achievements in various constructions. Recently, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, once again proving to the world the advancement of Soviet science and technology and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The working class and oppressed people all over the world are cheering for the achievements of the Soviet Union and regard the October Revolution as their own festival. The victory of the Soviet revolution powerfully promoted the victory of the Chinese revolution, and the various generous assistance given to us by the Soviet Union greatly accelerated the progress of our socialist construction. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is eternal and unbreakable.
    Our medical workers will never forget the various selfless assistance given by the Soviet Union. As early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union sent outstanding medical experts to help us with medical work and cadre training, which played a great role in improving our medical effects and the technical level of our cadres. After liberation, the Soviet Union gave us even more and greater assistance. Whenever we requested assistance, the Soviet government and people were able to provide us with the materials and technology we needed in a timely and selfless manner, and sent many outstanding experts to help us with our work and lectures. The Soviet government also accepted a large number of Chinese students for key training. The achievements of our health work are inseparable from the brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union and our serious study of the Soviet Union.
    We regard the Soviet Union as the most reliable good teacher and helpful friend to learn from. First of all, in terms of health and epidemic prevention, we have established more than 600 specialized prevention and treatment institutes (stations) and more than 1,500 epidemic prevention stations, teams, and groups based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, which have played a major role in preventing and controlling various infectious diseases. Health supervision work has also been carried out under the guidance of Soviet experts, making the new urban planning and the establishment of industrial enterprises more in line with health standards and conducive to people's health. In terms of medical treatment and prevention, we have learned from the advanced Soviet district medical system, carried out the workshop doctor system, and implemented preventive thinking in medical work. In terms of medical education, we have reformed teaching with reference to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, innovated our country's medical academic ideas, enriched the teaching content, improved teaching methods, and improved teaching quality. In terms of maternal and child health, scientific research, etc., we have also worked hard to learn from the Soviet Union. China's huge medical staff has a high enthusiasm for learning Soviet medicine. Since liberation, many Soviet medical lectures or study meetings have been held throughout the country. In 1953, the whole country generally studied Pavlov's theory. Various medical journals and publishing houses have introduced and published many Soviet medical literature. Many medical workers have actively learned Russian in order to directly learn Soviet medicine. In short, various organizational systems, working methods, academic theories, and technical operations in Soviet medicine are all the content of our study. Through learning from the Soviet Union, we have gained a lot of help in improving our work style and thinking methods, making our work smoother. In terms of academic thought, it has enabled us to better understand the relationship between medical science and social development and systems, as well as the guiding role of dialectical materialism in medicine. All these gains are very important.
    However, in the process of learning from the Soviet Union, we have had shortcomings and taken detours. On some issues, we have not combined well with our country's actual situation, and there have been phenomena of mechanical copying; sometimes we have publicized and promoted fragmentary and immature learning experiences; our understanding and application of advanced Soviet medical theories has sometimes been insufficient; and sometimes we have overemphasized imitating the material conditions of Soviet medical work and neglected the simple and down-to-earth style of Soviet medical workers. Although these shortcomings have appeared at different times, most of them have been corrected in time. The gains from learning are definitely the main thing.
    Of course, not all medical workers have clear ideas on the issue of learning from the Soviet Union. A few people still have doubts about the advancement of Soviet medicine. Bourgeois rightists have even stirred up trouble in this regard, distorting and slandering, trying to belittle the achievements of Soviet medicine, obstructing us from learning from the Soviet Union, and provoking discord between China and the Soviet Union. They often make comparisons with individual technical issues, thinking that the Soviet Union is not as good as capitalist countries. This is a view that confuses the overall situation with the local situation. If we compare individual technical issues, it can be said that all countries in the world have their own strengths and weaknesses. Because every industrialized country has a set of medical work and research institutions, each country may discover an individual principle or an individual method in the vast medical field. We believe that to analyze a country's scientific level and scientific progress, we must look at it comprehensively and developmentally. Based on this principle, it can be affirmed that Soviet medicine is advanced. The advancement of Soviet medicine is first manifested in the fact that it is truly for the benefit of the people. Soviet medical workers are inspired by this noble goal, and therefore can give full play to their high enthusiasm and creativity, and use the scientific world outlook of dialectical materialism to explore the mysteries of the medical field and obtain outstanding achievements. Facts have also proved that Soviet medicine is advanced not only in terms of guiding ideology and organizational system, but also in many academic and technical issues that are not as good as those in the United Kingdom and the United States, such as health care science, physiology and pathology of the nervous system, and atomic medicine. If we look at the speed of development, the Soviet Union was also a relatively backward country before the revolution. In the forty years since the founding of the country, it has been surrounded and blockaded by imperialism for a long time, and it has paid the most significant consumption of human and material resources in the Second World War. However, under such difficult circumstances, Soviet medicine can still advance by leaps and bounds, and be on par with the United States, which industrialized earlier and not only did not directly suffer from the war in the Second World War but made a fortune from the war. Some majors even surpassed the United States, and we must admit the advancement and superiority of Soviet medicine. As for some people who attribute some of the shortcomings in our learning (such as mechanical application) to the shortcomings of Soviet medicine itself, and use it to negate learning from the Soviet Union, that is even more wrong.
    Continuing to seriously learn from the Soviet Union is still our firm direction.
    In addition to learning from the Soviet Union's advanced organizational system, working methods, academic theories, etc., we must especially learn from the Soviet medical workers' spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. Serving the people is the starting point of all work in our socialist country. Because Soviet medical workers have this spirit, they can regard the suffering of the people as their own suffering, the joy of the people as their own joy, selflessly sacrifice themselves, overcome difficulties, be careful and cautious, strive for excellence, and constantly promote medical progress, and excellently complete various prevention, medical treatment, teaching, and research work.
    We must also learn from the internationalist spirit of Soviet medical workers. The Soviet Union has given us various generous and selfless assistance, and the attitude of Soviet experts during their work in our country of taking our cause as their own cause is a noble manifestation of internationalism. We must humbly learn from the Soviet Union, consolidate the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and strengthen the unity of socialist countries and the people of the world.
    We must also learn from the Soviet spirit of running undertakings diligently and frugally. The great achievements of the Soviet Union today have been achieved by the Soviet people through long-term arduous struggle. Although the material conditions of the Soviet Union have been greatly improved, they still maintain a diligent and frugal style. Work emphasizes practicality and not formalism, and equipment is used as much as possible. For us, who are still in the early stages of construction and have many difficulties in various aspects, it is even more necessary to learn this spirit of diligence, simplicity, and hard work.
    In order to better learn from the Soviet Union, we must resolutely smash the various slanders and attacks of the rightists, stand firmly on the position of the working class, master the weapon of dialectical materialism, and thoroughly carry out ideological transformation.
    Resolutely learn from the Soviet Union, strive to carry forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, critically absorb the advanced medical achievements of various countries in the world, and under the leadership of the Party, our country's medicine will surely achieve rapid development.

　　坚定不移地学习苏联先进医学
　　中华人民共和国卫生部副部长  中华医学会会长  傅连暲
    伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命，已经四十周年了。四十年来，苏联人民在苏联共产党的正确领导下，在马列主义的光辉照耀下，各项建设都获得了极其伟大的辉煌的成就。最近苏联发射了第一个人造卫星，再一次向全世界证明了苏联科学技术的先进性和社会主义制度的无比优越性。全世界的工人阶级和被压迫人民，都为苏联的成就而欢呼，都把十月革命节当作自己的节日。苏联革命的胜利，有力地推动了中国革命的胜利，苏联给予我们的各项慷慨援助，大大加速了我国社会主义建设的进度。中苏两国人民的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。
    我们医务工作者对苏联给予的各种无私的援助是永志不忘的。早在抗日战争时期，苏联就曾派遣优秀的医学专家来帮助我们进行医疗工作和训练干部，对提高我们的医疗效果和干部技术水平起了很大的作用。解放以后，苏联又给予了我们更多更大的援助。每当我们提出请求帮助的时候，苏联政府和人民都能及时地无私地供给我们需要的物质和技术，并派遣了许多优秀专家来帮助我们工作和讲学。苏联政府还接受了我国大批留学生进行重点培养。我国卫生工作的成就是和苏联的兄弟般的援助和我们认真的学习苏联分不开的。
    我们是把苏联当作最可靠的良师益友来学习的。首先，在卫生防疫方面，我们根据苏联先进经验建立了六百多个专科防治所（站）、一千五百多个防疫站、队、组，对防治各种传染病，起了重大作用。卫生监督工作也在苏联专家指导下开展了起来，使新的城市规划，工业企业的设置更加合乎卫生标准，利于人民健康。在医疗预防方面，我们学习了苏联先进的划区医疗制，开展了车间医生制及在医疗工作中贯彻预防思想等。在医学教育方面，我们参照苏联先进经验，进行了教学改革，革新了我国医学学术思想，丰富了教学内容，改进了教学方法，提高了教学质量。在妇幼卫生、科学研究等方面，也都努力地向苏联学习。我国庞大的医务工作者对学习苏联医学的热情是很高的。解放以来，全国各地举办了许多苏联医学讲座，或学习会，1953年全国还普遍学习了巴甫洛夫学说，各医学杂志和出版社，都介绍和刊出了许多苏联医学文献。很多医务工作者，为了能直接学习苏联医学，都积极地学习俄文。总之苏联医学方面的各种组织制度、工作方法、学术理论、技术操作都是我们学习的内容。经过向苏联学习，我们在工作作风、思想方法的改进上都获得了不少的帮助，使我们的工作更加顺利了。在学术思想方面，使我们更好地认识到，医学科学与社会发展及制度的关系，以及辩证唯物主义在医学上的指导作用。所有这些收获都是很重要的。
    但是在学习苏联过程中，我们曾有过缺点，走过弯路。在某些问题上，我们没有很好结合我国实际情况，有机械硬搬的现象；有时将片断的不成熟的学习经验予以宣传和推广；对于苏联先进医学理论的理解与运用，有时不够深入；并且有时过高地强调仿效苏联医务工作的物质条件，而忽视了苏联医务工作者俭朴踏实的作风。这些缺点，虽然曾分别在不同时期出现，然而大多已被及时纠正。学习的收获肯定是主要的。
    当然，在学习苏联的问题上，并不是所有医务工作者思想都通了。有少数人对苏联医学的先进性还抱有怀疑态度。资产阶级右派分子更在这方面兴风作浪，歪曲诬蔑，妄图贬低苏联医学的成就，阻挠我们学习苏联，挑拨离间中苏友谊，他们往往以个别技术问题作对比，认为苏联不如资本主义国家。这是一种以局部混淆全面的看法。如果以个别的技术问题来作对比，可以说世界各国都是各有所长各有所短的。因为各个工业发达的国家，都有一套医学工作和研究的机构，因此每个国家都有可能在浩繁广阔的医学领域中发现某一个别原理，和某一个别方法。我们认为分析一个国家的科学水平和科学进展，必须从全面与发展来看，根据这个道理，可以肯定地说苏联医学是先进的。苏联医学的先进性，首先表现在它是真正为人民谋福利的。苏联医务工作者为这一崇高目的所鼓舞，因而能以发挥高度的积极性和创造性，能以运用辩证唯物主义的科学世界观，去探索医学领域的奥秘，获取优异的成绩。事实也证明苏联医学不仅在指导思想、组织制度等方面是先进的，即在很多学术、技术问题上也为英美所不及。如卫生保健学、神经系统的生理病理学、原子医学等。如再从发展速度来看，苏联在革命前也是一个比较落后的国家，建国四十年来，曾长期受到帝国主义的包围与封锁，在第二次世界大战中又付出了最重大的人力物资的消耗，然而在这样艰难的情况之下，苏联医学仍然能够突飞猛进，和工业发达较早，在第二次世界大战中不仅没有直接遭到战祸反而发了战争横财的美国并驾齐驱，甚至有些专业超过美国，更不能不承认苏联医学的先进性与优越性。至于有的人把我们学习中的某些缺点（如生搬硬套）归之于苏联医学本身的缺点，用以否定学习苏联，那更是错误的。
    继续认真地学习苏联仍是我们坚定不移的方向。
    除了学习苏联先进的组织制度、工作方法、学术理论等而外，我们特别要学习苏联医务工作者全心全意为人民服务的精神。为人民服务，是我们社会主义国家一切工作的出发点。苏联医务工作者因为具有了这种精神，因而能以人民的痛苦为痛苦，以人民的欢乐为欢乐，忘我牺牲、克服困难、细心谨慎、精益求精，不断的推动医学前进，出色地完成各种预防、医疗、教学、研究工作。
    我们还必须学习苏联医务工作者的国际主义的精神，苏联给予我们各种慷慨无私的援助，苏联专家在我国工作期间所表现的那种以我们的事业作为自己事业的态度都是国际主义精神的崇高表现。我们要虚心的向苏联学习，巩固中苏友谊，加强社会主义各国以及全世界人民的团结。
    我们还要学习苏联勤俭办事业的精神。苏联现在的伟大成就都是苏联人民在长期艰苦斗争中取得的，虽然苏联的物质条件已大大改善，但仍然保持着勤俭的作风。工作重实际不重形式，设备能利用的尽量利用。对于尚在建设初期，各方面还有很多困难的我们，学习这种勤俭朴素、艰苦奋斗的精神是更为必要的。
    为了能够更好的学习苏联，我们必须坚决粉碎右派分子的各种诬蔑和进攻，站稳工人阶级的立场，掌握辩证唯物主义的武器，彻底进行思想改造。
    坚定不移地学习苏联，努力发扬祖国医学遗产，批判地吸收世界各国先进的医学成就，在党的领导下，我国的医学一定能够获得迅速的发展。
