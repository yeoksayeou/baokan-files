New Measures for Railway Passenger Transport

Starting November 1st, national railway passenger trains will implement winter schedules.

Due to the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge this winter, it has been decided to operate two pairs of through express passenger trains, Beijing–Guangzhou and Beijing–Pingxiang (which were implemented ahead of schedule on October 15th). To facilitate passengers traveling between East China and the Northwest, the Shanghai-Xi'an passenger express train will be extended to Lanzhou, and the Beijing-Changchun passenger train will be upgraded to an express train. In addition, new through passenger trains will be added from Qingdao to Shenyang, Xuzhou to Harbin, Tianjin to Harbin, Lanzhou to Xia Dong (west of Yumen), Xi'an to Chengdu, and Liuzhou to Duyun.

    铁路客运的新措施
    全国铁路旅客列车自11月1日起实行冬季时刻。
    今年冬季改点，由于武汉长江大桥的建成，决定开行了北京—广州、北京—凭祥两对直通旅客快车（已于10月15日提前实行），又为了便利华东与西北的旅客，将上海西安间旅客快车延长到兰州，同时将北京长春间旅客列车改为快车。此外，还增开了青岛到沈阳，徐州到哈尔滨，天津到哈尔滨，兰州到峡东（在玉门以西），西安到成都，柳州到都匀等直通客车。
