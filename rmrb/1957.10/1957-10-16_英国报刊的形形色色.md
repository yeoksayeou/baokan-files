　　The Motley Appearance of British Newspapers

　　Winning by Rumors
    Using a large amount of space to publish rumors about prominent figures and socialites is an important means for British bourgeois newspapers to attract readers. In early September, when the 89th annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress opened, gossip writers from the British bourgeois newspapers showed their skills. The "Daily Mail" meticulously described the hotel where the Chairman of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, Williamson and his wife, were staying, and said that while Williamson was presiding over the meeting, his wife was knitting a wool vest for her granddaughter. The "Daily Mail" praised the clothing and demeanor of a famous person attending the meeting and exaggerated his use of socks as tobacco pouches. John London, a gossip writer for the "News Chronicle," focused on reporting the private affairs of the delegates' wives, reaching a sensational level.

　　Demons and Monsters Poison the Youth
    There are many dirty, vulgar, and harmful pornographic publications, detective stories, and comic strips on British newsstands that poison children and teenagers. Some of them come from the United States. The "Mirror-Pictorial" group, known for being "good at understanding the psychology of young people," launched a teenage pictorial called "Rave" in June of this year. When the inaugural issue was published, the "Mirror-Pictorial" group made a big splash and published advertisements everywhere: "Subscribe to 'Rave'! If you are a bookworm, cautious, and uninteresting, don't subscribe to this pictorial!"
    The descriptions of pornography, crime, demons, and monsters in "Rave" were too explicit, arousing the indignation of some people. The magazine finally ceased publication at the end of August. In its final issue, the pictorial also used three pages to publish a fabricated photo story of a crime of passion, offering a reward of one hundred pounds to solicit readers to go to the forest to find the corpse of the murdered girl. The editor's note explained the path to the forest and clues for finding the body, and pointed out that the so-called corpse was a small green box made of plastic, containing a camera.

　　Promoting Sales by All Means
    In order to promote sales, British bourgeois newspapers do not hesitate to adopt all kinds of clumsy and ridiculous means. The "Daily Mail" used live people as prizes in September of this year, which caused a sensation. The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" has recently also attempted to use seaside villas or village shops as promotional prizes. The "Daily Herald" advertisement said: "The winner can get a fully equipped seaside villa with a garden worth six thousand five hundred pounds—estimated to earn five hundred pounds a year from renting the villa."

　　Controlling the Market and Wasting Paper
    British bourgeois newspaper tycoons not only control the newsprint market, but also control newspaper advertising. This allows them to do whatever they want, arbitrarily expand pages, increase circulation, and rake in huge profits. In 1956, the advertising revenue of the Beaverbrook Group, which belongs to the "Daily Express," reached 9.5 million pounds, while sales revenue was only 9 million pounds; the "Mirror" Group's advertising revenue was 10 million pounds, while sales revenue was only 5.5 million pounds.
    The competition among British bourgeois newspapers to arbitrarily increase the number of pages is also very fierce. In this competition, the "Daily Express" took the lead. In April of this year alone, the "Daily Express" had ninety more pages of news, advertisements, and features than the "Daily Herald," which had a similar price, and seventy-two more pages than the "News Chronicle." In the face of increasingly fierce competition, there are also those who are original and win by surprise. For example, the "Daily Mail" touts itself as the "daily newspaper for busy workers," calling on readers to pay attention to the "simplicity and compactness" of the newspaper and not to be greedy for cheapness.

### 英国报刊的形形色色

　　英国报刊的形形色色
　　流言蜚语出奇制胜
    用大量篇幅刊登有关显要人物、交际名媛的流言蜚语，是英国资产阶级报刊吸引读者的一个重要手段。9月初，英国职工大会第八十九届年会开幕，英国资产阶级报刊杂谈作家便大显身手。“每日简报”对职工大会最高委员会主席威廉逊夫妇下榻的旅馆作了细致入微的描绘，并说，威廉逊主持大会的时候，他的夫人正在为孙女织羊毛背心。“每日邮报”对出席大会的一位著名的人物的服装、风度作了一番吹捧，对他用袜子充当烟袋的事大加渲染。“新闻纪事报”的杂谈作家约翰·伦敦更集中地报道了代表夫人们的私事，达到了耸人听闻的程度。
　　牛鬼蛇神荼毒青年
    英国报摊上有不少肮脏、下流、毒害少年儿童的色情报刊、侦探故事、连环图画。其中也有从美国来的。以“善于了解青年心理”著称的“镜报—画报”集团于今年6月创办了一个名叫“恣情行乐”的少年画报。创刊号出版时，“镜报—画报”集团大吹大擂，到处刊登广告：“订一份‘恣情行乐’吧！如果你是一个书呆子、谨小慎微、毫无生趣的人，你就不订这份画报！”
    “恣情行乐”里的色情、犯罪、牛鬼蛇神的描写过于露骨，激起一些人的愤慨。8月底该刊终于停刊。在终刊号上，这个画报还用了三页的篇幅刊登了一个杜撰的情杀案照片故事，悬赏一百英镑，征求读者到森林里去寻找被杀害的少女的尸体。在编者注里说明了到森林去的路径与寻找尸体的线索，又指出所谓尸体是塑胶制的一个绿色小盒子，里面装的是一个照像机。
　　推广销路不择手段
    英国资产阶级报刊为了推广销路，不惜采用一切拙劣可笑的手段。“每日简报”今年9月用活人当奖品的办法，曾经轰动一时。工党的“每日先驱报”最近也企图以海滨别墅或乡村商店作为推销的奖品。“每日先驱报”的广告说：“优胜者可以得到价值六千五百英镑设备齐全、附设花园的海滨别墅—估计出租别墅每年可以收入五百英镑。”
　　控制市场浪费纸张
    英国资产阶级的报业大王不但控制了白报纸市场，也控制了报纸的广告。这样他们就能够为所欲为、任意扩充篇幅、提高发行数字、搜括巨大利润。1956年，“每日快报”所属的比维尔勃鲁克集团的广告收入高达九百五十万英镑，而销售的收入只有九百万英镑；“镜报”集团广告收入一千万英镑，而销售收入仅五百五十万英镑。
    英国资产阶级报刊任意增加篇幅的竞争也是很剧烈的。在这个竞争里，“每日快报”一马当先。今年4月一个月，“每日快报”比售价相近的“每日先驱报”多出了九十页的新闻、广告及特写，比“新闻纪事报”多出七十二页。在竞争愈演愈烈的情况下，也有别出心裁、出奇制胜的。例如“每日邮报”就标榜自己的“工作忙碌者的日报”，号召读者注意报纸的“简洁性、紧凑性”，不要贪便宜。　（乐山）
