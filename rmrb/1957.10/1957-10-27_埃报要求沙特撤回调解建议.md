Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 26th: Egyptian newspapers on October 25th demanded that the King of Saudi Arabia withdraw his proposed "mediation" between Turkey and Syria.

    "Al-Gomhouria" stated that Saudi Arabia should immediately announce the withdrawal of its proposal, because the United States and Turkey might use this proposal to prevent the United Nations from taking any action to stop their conspiracy.

    "Al-Ahram" stated that all Arabs expect the Saudi King to take this step as soon as possible; as long as this step is taken, the conspiracies of Turkey and the United States will fail.
