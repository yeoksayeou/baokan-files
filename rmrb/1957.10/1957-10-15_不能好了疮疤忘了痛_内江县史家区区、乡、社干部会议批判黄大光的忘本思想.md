Cannot Forget the Pain Once the Scars Heal
　　——A Meeting of District, Township, and Commune Cadres in Shijia District, Neijiang County, Criticizes Huang Daguan's Ungrateful Thoughts

    A Couplet

    Recently, on the walls of the Shijia District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Neijiang County, Sichuan, a thought-provoking couplet was posted:

    The first line reads: "Thinking of the past, gathering firewood and manure, living in thatched sheds for decades, life was hard and no one cared, have you forgotten?" The second line reads: "After liberation, land and soil were distributed, living in tall tile-roofed houses and not moving, life is getting sweeter and sweeter, yet you show no gratitude?"

    This couplet was written for Huang Daguan, who is just twenty-two years old this year. He was born into a poor peasant family and lived a life of hardship and suffering from a young age. After liberation, his family turned over, received land, and joined the Shunjiang Agricultural Cooperative. Huang Daguan became the cooperative's team accountant, served as the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League's Shidong Township General Branch, and joined the Party. One would think that such a rural youth should be a good example for young people. However, things took an unexpected turn.

    Huang Daguan Complains of "Suffering"

    In late September, Shijia District held a three-level cadre meeting of district, township, and commune cadres to carry out a major debate on the two roads in the countryside. At this meeting, Huang Daguan actually said: "Life after liberation is not as good as before liberation. My nephew is so hungry he licks the pot, and my father didn't even have a sip of rice soup before he died. The Communist Party oppresses the people more harshly than the reactionaries of the past. The Communist Party's heart is biased." He even deceivingly said: "I have grown up relying on the rice bin since I was a child, and I have never lived such a life as I do now." After Huang Daguan's opinions were "released," people who knew his family's situation felt indignant and heartbroken, and they stepped forward to debate with Huang Daguan.

    Let's Look at the Truth

    Gao Peicheng, the secretary of the Shunjiang Cooperative branch of the Communist Party, first exposed his background. He said: "Huang Daguan, we both live in the same township and are neighbors, growing up in the same place. I know the hardships you have suffered, and you know the hardships I have suffered. No one can hide anything from each other. Don't you remember what your situation was like in the past? Before liberation, your family was extremely poor, without a tile above or an inch of land below. To describe your house as 'a thousand pillars on the ground, ten thousand loads of raw melons, forty-eight courtyards, and seventy-two government offices' is not an exaggeration at all."

    Readers, how should these few sentences be explained to Huang Daguan? This is to say that before liberation, Huang Daguan's home was so dilapidated that the four walls of the thatched house were woven from inverted sorghum stalks. The roots of the inverted sorghum stalks resembled "ten thousand loads of melons," and the sparse sorghum stalks were like "a thousand pillars." When it rained, the roof leaked, as if dozens of skylights had been opened, and the four sides of the house were full of holes, through which one could crawl into the thatched house.

    Gao Peicheng couldn't help but ask here: "Comrades who know Huang Daguan's family situation, would you say this is the case?"

    "Yes, even the fight of field mice would shake the house down," Gao Changcheng, the secretary of the Shidong Township General Branch of the Communist Youth League, replied.

    Gao Peicheng continued to say to Huang Daguan: "Do you remember? One year, your family was cooking corn soup when suddenly a gust of wind blew, causing the house to creak. Your mother shouted to your father, 'Old man, quickly hang up the pot!' Your father kept calling out to your youngest daughter. As a result, the pot was still knocked over, and the thatched house was blown to pieces. Helpless, you had to beg the landlord, but the landlord didn't want to help you. In the end, we helped your family rebuild the thatched house. Have you forgotten? To be honest, the thatched house you used to live in wasn't even as good as the manure shed of Shunjiang Cooperative today! A few days ago, I went to ask your mother again, and she burst into tears when she mentioned this matter. You should think carefully, which is better, today or the past? Your father was drafted seven times before liberation, worked as a hired laborer for thirty years, and was eventually beaten into a fool. Your older brother also worked as a hired laborer for seven years. What about you? You started working for the landlord Pu Chaoyan at the age of thirteen. At that time, you couldn't even carry a basket on your back, and the two of you, mother and daughter, cried bitterly. Is this the benefit of the reactionaries? Now, you have become an accountant, the director of the club, and earlier this year you went to Chengdu as an explainer for the agricultural exhibition, meeting Vice Chairman Zhu De. How can you not remember these things? The Communist Party fought for thirty years and rescued us from the fire and the pit. How can you be so ungrateful? I can draw the following conclusion: Comparing your past life with your present life is like Sun Wukong somersaulting – a difference of one hundred and eight thousand li. You say your present life is more bitter than coptis chinensis, but I say your present life is sweeter than honey!"

    Tan Yongquan continued, "Since the establishment of the Shunjiang Cooperative in 1954, it has increased production every year. In 1954, the grain yield per mu was 559 jin, and by 1956, the grain yield per mu reached 973 jin. This year, it is estimated that the grain yield per mu will reach 1,100 jin, doubling the production compared to 1954. Regarding the increase in sugarcane production, in 1954, the sugarcane yield per mu was 7,162 jin, and in 1957, the sugarcane yield per mu will reach 10,000 jin. Huang Daguan's statement that the advanced cooperative is not as good as the elementary cooperative, the elementary cooperative is not as good as the mutual aid team, and the mutual aid team is not as good as the individual peasant is completely untrue..."

    At this time, Huang Daguan interjected, "My family didn't get so much grain." In order to clarify the truth, Zheng Wenhe, the director of the Shunjiang Cooperative, asked Sun Zecheng, the accountant who was attending the meeting, to calculate his production increase account over the years on the spot.

    Sun Zecheng then opened the ledger and began to calculate Huang Daguan's production increase account over the years. It turned out that in 1954, when Huang Daguan's family was working individually, the total grain production for the year was 2,235 jin, with an average of 373 jin of grain per person and a total income of 205 yuan. Since Huang Daguan's family joined the cooperative in 1955, they have achieved increased production every year. In 1956, his family received a total of 4,827 jin of grain, with an average of 804 jin of grain per person and a total income of 366 yuan. It is estimated that this year Huang Daguan's family's total income will reach about 398 yuan. These facts left Huang Daguan speechless.

    Refuting Two Lies

    At this time, Liu Shengrong stood up and said, "Huang Daguan, it is not true that your nephew is so hungry that he licks the pot. I know very well that your sister's family made rice cereal for the child, and your nephew licked the little bit of rice cereal on the edge of the bowl for fun. You even used this little thing to attack the Party and attack cooperativization. Look at everyone, does Huang Daguan look like he's thin and emaciated?" Feng Boyao, a newly lower-middle peasant, continued, "Last March, your sister's family slaughtered a chicken and invited your father to eat it. He choked on a chicken bone, vomited blood when he returned home, and died not long after. Doctor Liu Yulin can testify to this matter. How can you have the nerve to say that he died without even drinking a sip of rice soup?" Coincidentally, Liu Yulin came to the market that day and also participated in the debate. He immediately continued, "I was the one who treated your father's illness. He did die because a chicken bone was stuck in his throat."

    A debate that insisted on reasoning and struggle completely refuted Huang Daguan's fallacies.

    Huang Daguan Admits His Mistake

    However, what caused Huang Daguan to become an ungrateful person? Everyone believed that this was mainly due to the serious development of individualistic thought and forgetting the pain once the scars healed. At the same time, he was influenced by the thoughts of landlords and rich peasants, his class standpoint was blurred, and therefore he lied against his conscience. Finally, Huang Daguan also publicly admitted this point at the debate and examined his mistakes. He said: "My slanderous remarks against the Party and cooperativization are completely unfounded. To tell you the truth, my current life is many times better than before. I wear a set, make a set, and still have a set stored at home. Originally, two people could move the house away, but now the added clothes and sundries fill the house to the brim. Furthermore, the Party has given me a lot of honors. From now on, I will work hard and repay the Party with practical actions."

　　不能好了疮疤忘了痛
　　——内江县史家区区、乡、社干部会议批判黄大光的忘本思想
　　张珂　沈杰　张利泉
    一副对联
    四川内江县中共史家区区委会的墙壁上，最近贴有这样一副引人深思的对联。
    上联是：“想从前，拣柴又拣粪，茅草棚棚住了几十载，生活苦难无人问，你忘记了？”下联是：“解放后，分田又分土，高房瓦屋住起不搬家，日子越过越香甜，还不知恩？”
    这副对联是为黄大光而写的，黄大光今年才满二十二岁。他出身在一个贫农家庭里，从小就过着辛酸、苦楚的生活。解放后，他家翻了身，分了土地，参加了顺江农业社。黄大光当上了社的队会计，担任了共青团史东乡团总支副书记的职务，并且入了党。像这样一个农村青年，应该说是青年人中的好榜样了。但是，事情却出人意料之外。
    黄大光诉“苦”
    9月下旬，史家区召开了一次区、乡、社三级干部会议，开展农村中走两条道路的大辩论。黄大光在这次会议上，竟然说：“解放后的生活不如解放前好，我外侄饿得来舐瓢儿，我父亲临死前连米汤都没有吃一口，共产党压迫人民比过去反动派还凶。共产党的心偏到一边去了”。他还自欺欺人地说：“我自小来就靠着米柜子长大的，从来没有过过像现在这样的生活。”黄大光这些意见“放”出来以后，了解他家情况的人都感到激愤和痛心。纷纷起来同黄大光辩论。
    请看真相
    中共顺江社支部书记高培成首先揭开了他的底子。他说：“黄大光，我们两人住在一个乡，又是邻居，从小在一个地方长大的，你受的苦我知道，我受的苦你知道，谁也瞒不了谁。你不想想，从前你是什么光景？解放前，你家是上无片瓦，下无寸土的赤贫，用‘千柱落地，万担生瓜，四十八口天井，七十二道衙门，来形容你家的房子，是一点也不夸张的”。
    读者们，这几句话对黄大光来说应该怎么解释呢？这是说，解放前，黄大光的家是那么破烂不堪，茅草房的四围是用倒立的高粱秆编成的，倒竖的高粱秆根部就像结了“万担瓜”似的，稀疏的高粱秆又像“千根柱”一样，下雨屋漏，好像是开了几十眼天窗，屋的四面到处都是洞，从各处都可以钻进茅草房里去。
    高培成说到这里禁不住问道：“知道黄大光家的同志们，你们说，是不是这样的情况？”
    “是呵，地马儿（老鼠）打架也把房子震得垮。”史东乡团总支书记高长成这样回答。
    高培成继续对黄大光说：“你还记得不？有一年，你家正在煮玉米汤巴吃，忽然一阵风吹来，把屋子刮得吱吱直响，你妈喊你爹‘老汉，快把锅吊起’，你爹又直叫小女儿。结果，吊锅还是震倒了，茅草房也刮得七零八落的，没奈何，你们只得去哀求地主，地主不给你们想办法，最后还是我们帮助你家把茅草房重新搭起来，你难道忘了？说实话，你家从前住的茅草房还比不上今日顺江社的粪棚哩！前几天，我又去问过你的妈，她提起这件事情眼泪还直滚，你应该好好想一想，究竟是今天好还是过去好？你父亲在解放前被拉七次壮丁，当了三十年长工，最后，被人打成一个傻子。你的哥哥也帮了七年的长工。你呢？十三岁就帮地主蒲朝堰干活，那时连背篼都背不起，娘儿俩抱头痛哭了一场，这难道就是反动派的好处吗？现在，你当上了会计，俱乐部主任，今年初还到成都作农业展览会的解说员，见到了朱德副主席。这些事情你怎么就记不起了？共产党斗争了三十年，把我们从火海陷井中救出来，你怎么就忘恩了；我可以下这样的结论：拿你从前的生活和现在对比，简直像孙悟空打跟斗一样——相差十万八千里。你说你现在的生活比黄连还苦，我说你现在的生活比蜂蜜还甜”！
    谭雍全接着说：“顺江社从1954年成立以来，年年增产，1954年粮食亩产五百五十九斤，到1956年粮食亩产就达到九百七十三斤，今年预计：粮食亩产将达到一千一百斤，比1954年增产一倍。再说甘蔗的增产情况，1954年甘蔗亩产七千一百六十二斤，1957年甘蔗亩产将达到一万斤。黄大光说高级社不如低级社，低级社不如互助组，互助组不如单干农民，完全不是事实……”。
    黄大光这时插嘴说：“我家就没有分到那么多粮食。”为了弄清事实的真象，顺江社主任郑文和，叫在这里参加会议的会计孙泽成当场把他几年来的增产账打一打。
    孙泽成接着就打开账簿，算起黄大光几年来的增产账来。原来1954年黄大光家单干的时候，全年产粮食二千二百三十五斤，每人平均三百七十三斤粮食，总收入二百零五元。从1955年黄大光的家入社后每年都获得增产。1956年，他家共分了四千八百二十七斤粮食，每人平均分粮食八百零四斤，总收入三百六十六元。预计今年黄大光家总收入可达三百九十八元左右。这些事实把黄大光驳得哑口无言。
    驳两项谎言
    这时，刘盛荣站起来说：“黄大光，你说你外侄儿饿得来舐瓢儿，这不是事实。我就很清楚，你姊姊家给娃儿搞米糊吃，碗边上巴一点米糊，你的外侄舐着好玩，连这一点点事情都被你利用来攻击党、攻击合作化了。大家看看，黄大光哪点像黄皮寡瘦的样子。”新下中农冯伯耀接着说：“去年3月，你姊姊家杀鸡，把你父亲请去吃，他被鸡骨卡住了喉咙，回家后便吐血，不久就死去了。这件事情还有医生刘玉林作证，你好意思说他饿得连米汤都没吃一口就死去了？”碰巧刘玉林这天来赶场，也参加了辩论会。他马上接着说：“你父亲的病是我在医，那的确是因为鸡骨卡在喉咙里而死的。”
    一个坚持说理斗争的辩论会把黄大光的谬论全部驳倒了。
    黄大光认错
    但是，什么原因使黄大光变成一个忘恩负义的人呢？大家认为，这主要是个人主义思想的严重发展，好了疮疤忘了痛；同时他受到了地主、富农的思想影响，阶级立场模糊了，因此昧着良心说假话。最后，黄大光也在辩论会上公开地承认了这点，检查了自己的错误。他说：“我诬蔑党和合作化的一些言论是完全没有根据的，说句良心话，我黄大光现在的生活不知比从前好多少倍，我穿一套，做一套，家里还存一套。原来两个人都可以把家搬走，现在添制的衣服、什物把房子摆得满满的，再说，党给我的荣誉也很不少，从今后我要好好地工作，用实际行动来报答党。”
