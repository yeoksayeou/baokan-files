Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: With the assistance of the Soviet Union, the preparatory committee of the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has comprehensively arranged and gradually begun various research tasks, and experimental reports have been made in some areas. It is expected that before too long, China's first large-scale high-speed general-purpose electronic computer will be manufactured in this institute. Soviet electronic computer expert Sherbakov and computational mathematics expert Smeglevsky arrived in Beijing last week and began to directly and specifically help Chinese scientists carry out research on large-scale high-speed general-purpose electronic computers.

The research work of this institute is being carried out on the basis of the latest Soviet technology. Since the preparatory work for this institute began in July last year, Soviet assistance has enabled the preparatory work to proceed rapidly and smoothly. In October last year, an observation group organized by senior researchers of the institute went to the Soviet Union. The Institute of Computing Technology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences enthusiastically introduced their research results to the observation group without reservation and presented many boxes of equipment for the observation group to carry out research work after returning to China. Now, most of the equipment used by this institute is donated by the Soviet Union. Recently, when experts Sherbakov and Smeglevsky came to China, they brought a large number of equipment and materials for manufacturing and using electronic computers as gifts to the institute. These gifts will greatly shorten the research process for China's manufacturing of electronic computers. In addition, the Soviet Academy of Sciences is also training young experts in manufacturing electronic computers for the institute.

This institute will become the center of our country's research on computing skills. Several professors and experts with research in computing technology have now gathered at the institute. Construction of an electronic computing building and several experimental factories are also underway.

　　我国计算技术研究工作在苏联帮助下迈进一步
    大型快速通用电子计算机将制成
    电子计算大楼和一些试验工厂正在施工中
    新华社10日讯　中国科学院计算技术研究所筹备委员会在苏联援助下，已经全面布置并逐步开始各种研究工作，有些方面已做出了试验报告。预计不会太久，我国第一架大型快速通用电子计算机就会在这个研究所里制造出来。苏联电子计算机专家谢尔巴可夫、计算数学专家斯梅格列夫斯基已于上周来到北京，开始直接具体地帮助我国的科学工作者开展大型快速通用电子计算机的研究工作。
    这个研究所的研究工作是在苏联最新技术基础上开展的。自去年7月这个研究所开始筹建以来，苏联的援助使筹建工作迅速而顺利的进行。去年10月，研究所的高级研究人员组织的考察团到了苏联，苏联科学院计算技术研究所毫无保留地热情地向考察团介绍了他们的研究成果，又赠送了许多箱器材供考察团回国后开展研究工作之用。现在，这个研究所所用的器材大部分是苏联赠送的。最近谢尔巴可夫、斯梅格列夫斯基两位专家来我国时，又带了大批的制造和使用电子计算机的器材和资料，作为礼物送给这个研究所。这些礼物将大大缩短我国制造电子计算机的研究过程。另外，苏联科学院还在为这个研究所培养制造电子计算机的青年专家。
    这个研究所将成为我国研究计算技能的中心。现在已经有若干对计算技术有研究的教授和专家集中在研究所里。一座电子计算大楼和一些试验工厂建设工程也正在施工中。
