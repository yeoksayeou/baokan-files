Good News for Instrumental Music Lovers

    The Guangzhou Musical Instrument Research Institute has recently trial-produced a batch of bamboo wind instruments. These instruments are easy to learn and low in cost. A mass bamboo wind band can be equipped for less than one hundred yuan. The newly established Guangzhou Youth Student Bamboo Wind Band, with ninety members, adopted this instrument. After more than a month of spare-time practice (actually using sixteen hours), they are able to play tunes of various styles, such as Mendelssohn's "A Midsummer Night's Dream", Guangdong music "Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake", etc., and are full of the characteristics of bamboo wind instruments.
    The institute also used scientific methods to improve the Chaozhou Suona, which not only maintained its original style, but also controlled the volume and modulation, which the performers found very suitable. In the past, the manufacture of violins was mostly based on imitation, and no most reasonable standard had been researched. Now the staff of the institute are exploring the structural principle of the sound box, drawing structural graphics, and have made some prototypes.

    器乐爱好者的好消息
    广州乐器制造研究所最近试制了一批竹管乐器。这些乐器容易学、成本低，用不到一百块钱的成本，就能配备一个群众性的竹管乐队。新成立的拥有九十人的广州青年学生竹管乐队采用了这种乐器，经过一个多月的课余练习（实际用了十六个小时）便能够演奏各种风格的曲调，如孟德尔逊的“仲夏夜之梦”、广东音乐“平湖秋月”等，而且富有竹管乐器的特色。
    该所还用科学方法改良了潮州唢呐，既保持了原来风格，又能控制音量和转调，艺人们使用起来也觉得很合适。小提琴的制造，过去多出于模仿，没有研究出一个最合理的标准，现在该所工作人员在探求共鸣箱的构造原理，绘出结构的图形，并已制成一些试验品。
