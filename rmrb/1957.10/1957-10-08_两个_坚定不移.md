Two "Unswerving"
By Our Correspondent Gu Lei

    An Extraordinary Month
    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant began its "big blooming, big contending" campaign on August 23rd and basically concluded it on September 26th. This was a very extraordinary month. During this month, there were both high tides of "big blooming, big contending" and high tides of improving work. What was accomplished in this month would have taken many months if relying on the old working methods! According to the statistics of September 21st, a total of 7,447 big-character posters were put up throughout the plant, 1,382 various discussion meetings were held, and workers raised a total of 20,408 issues. Among them, 15,002 have been resolved or are about to be resolved, accounting for 73.5% of the total, with an average of more than 500 issues resolved per day. This shows that the rectification movement in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is developing normally, the enthusiasm of workers and cadres is high, and the speed of solving problems is very fast.
    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (hereinafter referred to as the Party Committee) did a lot of work in this stage, and the most important thing was to firmly grasp the leadership of policy and ideology. If the content of this leadership is summarized, there are only two sentences: unswervingly trust the majority of workers and let them freely carry out "big blooming, big contending"; unswervingly implement the principle of rectifying while correcting and vigorously improve work.
    The rectification movement in this plant began in late May. At that time, the Party Committee held nineteen discussion meetings in the plant to solicit opinions from employees, and organized five special groups to analyze and study the internal contradictions of the enterprise from five aspects: production technology management, welfare, wages and rewards, and Party-masses relations, and began to solve some of the problems in these areas. At the same time, ideological education for the anti-rightist struggle was carried out among employees, three reports were made to workers, and staff members were organized to study for more than forty days. These activities over the past two months have played a significant role in raising the class consciousness of employees and have been of great help to this "big blooming, big contending," which can be said to be the preparatory stage for "big blooming, big contending." However, when launching the "big blooming, big contending," many ideological obstacles were still encountered.
    Unswervingly Believe in the Majority of Workers
    At that time, some leading comrades had concerns. They were hesitant, doubting whether the workers would put down their tools after the "big blooming, big contending," whether it would disrupt production order, and whether it would affect production.... In short, they were afraid that the workers would make trouble. Some people were also afraid that the workers would not be able to "bloom and contend." To eliminate these ideological obstacles, the Party Committee studied the situation of all workers in the plant. There were 2,215 veteran workers with more than eight years of work experience, accounting for about one-quarter of the total number of workers. They had a high level of class consciousness and were the backbone of previous movements. There were 6,557 workers with three to seven years of work experience, accounting for about 70% of the total number of workers. They had received education in the democratic reform or the General Trade Union and most of them could respond to the Party's call and actively participate in various movements. Only 689 young workers who entered the factory after 1954 had not received class education, but the proportion they accounted for was very small. From the perspective of production, the output of pig iron in 1956 was 15.84 times that of 1949, which was a sign that workers cherished the socialist cause and carried out heroic labor. From the perspective of the Party and Youth League organizations, the number of Party members and Youth League members accounted for more than 50% of the total number. This is not ordinary statistics, but a direction indicator of the basic political situation of the factory.
    After analyzing the above basic situation, the factory Party Committee believed that the vast majority of workers would sincerely help the Party in its rectification, strengthened its determination to launch the "big blooming, big contending," and unified the understanding of this issue among the leading cadres. Therefore, it educated Party organizations at all levels and leading cadres at all levels to believe in the majority of workers, to be ideologically prepared to accept various criticisms, not to be impatient, and even more not to retaliate. At the same time, it conducted two plant-wide mobilizations through large and small meetings, calling on every worker to take the attitude of being the master of the house to help the Party in its rectification, to expose the shortcomings in their work with big-character posters, to criticize the bureaucratic work style of leading cadres, and to say whatever they had to say. In order to dispel the concerns of the masses that leading cadres might give them a hard time, the Party Committee assured the masses that people who made suggestions would absolutely not be subjected to retaliation.
    Encourage Workers to "Bloom and Contend" in the Form of Big-Character Posters
    At the beginning of the movement, many workers (including some Party and Youth League members) were not used to the form of big-character posters, feeling that this method was too intense. Some people said, "We are all our own people, we can just talk about our opinions in small meetings, why bother posting them up!" At this time, the Party Committee, through various branches, called on Party members, Youth League members, and trade union activists to take the lead in making suggestions to the leaders in the form of big-character posters. In order to create a climax of "big blooming, big contending," the Party Committee specially instructed leaders of various branches and units to create all conditions for workers to "bloom and contend." On the one hand, it continued to mobilize, distribute various stationery, and promote the role of big-character posters in large and small meetings, giving encouragement to those who wrote big-character posters. On the other hand, because many people could not write, it also adopted the forms of discussion meetings and interviews to give these people the opportunity to make suggestions and let them "bloom and contend" what was in their hearts. From then on, the number of big-character posters increased day by day.
    At this time, some people who were criticized saw that some criticisms were not comprehensive enough or that the tone was radical, and asked, "Can the criticized speak?" The Party Committee heard this feedback and, in order to protect the enthusiasm of the masses for "big blooming, big contending," proposed to the leading cadres: listen to everyone first, do not rush to explain, even if you hear wrong opinions, do not immediately refute them, the main thing is to listen to correct criticisms and consider how to correct your own shortcomings.
    Through the above work, a climax of "big blooming, big contending" was immediately set off throughout the plant. From August 23 to September 6, in just over ten days, more than 2,700 people in the plant posted more than 4,300 big-character posters, raising more than 4,800 opinions; in various discussion meetings, 3,917 people raised 11,757 opinions. (In the two-month process before the "big blooming, big contending," only 149 people raised 451 opinions). Among the opinions raised, the vast majority were correct and related to production and cadre style.
    Unswervingly Implement the Policy of Rectifying While Correcting
    In the process of rectification, if it is said that ideological criticism still requires a process, and all problems cannot be solved immediately, then this cannot be the case when it comes to improving work. This is not only because improving work is the purpose of rectification, but also because timely improvement of shortcomings in work can powerfully promote "big blooming, big contending," is an indispensable factor for continuing to carry out "blooming and contending," and is the issue that workers are most concerned about. When "big blooming, big contending" began, some workers said, "Some opinions have been raised long ago, but they have not been changed. It is really stale dirt and manure, the more you turn it over, the more boring it becomes!" This shows that workers lack confidence in the leadership's stated commitment to rectify while correcting. Many workers had not completely dispelled their concerns about being retaliated against, because they had not seen the leadership's actual actions to improve work and style. After learning about this situation, the Party Committee immediately announced to all cadres in the plant: unswervingly implement the policy of rectifying while correcting, and vigorously improve work. The specific tasks are: problems, whether new or old, large or small, should be changed immediately if they can be changed immediately; if they cannot be changed immediately, a plan for change should be formulated, a dedicated person should be assigned to be responsible for completing it within a time limit, and it should be announced to the masses, so that every opinion has an explanation.
    No Distinction Between "New" and "Old" "Large" and "Small" Problems, Each and Every One Has an Explanation
    Why is it necessary to specifically raise the issue of "new" and "old" and "large" and "small" problems? Because at that time, some cadres believed that large problems should be solved, while small problems could be put off or slowed down. These comrades did not understand that when workers raise an opinion, it is after some consideration, and after the opinion is raised, they always want to see the results. From his own perspective, it is a major concern. If no attitude is expressed towards these opinions, it will dampen the enthusiasm of the masses to raise opinions. As for those problems that have been dragged on for several years, if they can be solved immediately, workers can see the leadership's determination and sincerity in improving work. For example, the whistle set up in the factory to tell the time to the staff of the Apple Orchard was installed in 1955, but it had never been used, and the workers had raised this issue many times. When worker Niu Yongshun made a suggestion on September 5, he said: "Everyone is tired of mentioning the whistle problem, but no one has solved it. The workers on the night shift are afraid of oversleeping, they can't sleep soundly, and they have a heavy mental burden." On the fourth night after the suggestion was made, the whistle screamed loudly. Niu Yongshun said happily: "Ha! Now it sounds as soon as it is bloomed and contended!" For example, on August 24, loading and unloading worker Xiong Shugui posted a big-character poster: "The road from Xiaobeimen to the cement cave is difficult to walk to and from work, especially on rainy nights. I hope the leadership will solve it." On August 27, the Transportation Department mobilized cadres and comrades from the Electrical Affairs Team to build a small road and install five electric lights. The workers said: "Big-character posters are still effective. As soon as it was raised, the road was repaired!" The solution of these old and small problems further encouraged the enthusiasm of workers to "bloom and contend." Coal washing worker Li Hongchun made a suggestion on the selection of advanced producers in the workshop, and the branch immediately talked to him, expressing acceptance of the criticism. He then made four more suggestions.
    Rely on the Masses, Everyone Works Together to Solve Problems
    In order to ensure that problems are solved in a timely, correct, and comprehensive manner, the Party Committee paid attention to reversing the practice in the early stage of the movement where only a few cadres were busy solving problems, and proposed the policy of relying on the masses and everyone working together. The more effective methods can be roughly divided into four categories. First, the responsibility for solving problems is delegated at all levels. In addition to some major problems being studied and resolved by the factory or workshop, problems within the scope of departments, work sections, and teams are handed over to them, and the Party branch, section chief, work section chief, or production team leader absorb old workers, business personnel, employee representatives, etc. to jointly study, propose handling opinions, and implement them after review by the general branch committee or the factory department. Second, mobilize personnel from various professional systems to study and solve problems. In the factory department, the factory director and chief engineer are respectively responsible for reviewing the handling of problems in their respective systems, and the functional personnel of each workshop are responsible for understanding and proposing opinions on the handling of problems belonging to their respective specialties. For equipment problems, mobilize repair workers and professional maintenance teams to solve them. Third, for the suggestions made by workers, absorb the people who made the suggestions to participate, jointly propose solutions, and jointly implement them. Fourth, for problems in ideology and work style, organize the criticized and the critics to hold discussion meetings or individual talks, talk to each other, accept criticism on the one hand, and explain certain misunderstandings on the other, and enhance unity. The 274 cadres who were criticized this time held 126 discussion meetings and made self-criticisms to 1,239 people. Among these four methods of dealing with problems, except for the fourth method, the problems handled by the first three methods (those that have been solved and those that are being solved) are all announced to the masses in a timely manner. In order to quickly deal with problems, the plant transferred more than 250 cadres to participate in the work of the rectification office at all levels, and at most, it mobilized 964 cadres to work overnight to deal with the problems raised by the workers. In this way, the problems raised by everyone are solved by everyone, so it is very fast, thus setting off a climax of improving work and style.
    Through the above work, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has made explanations for all the opinions raised by employees that have been collected, except for a part that is not clear and needs further investigation, a part that is transferred to the higher authorities for resolution, and a part that needs to be resolved through mass debates. This has a decisive impact on promoting "big blooming, big contending." For example, at the first meeting of the Second Workers' Representative Assembly held on September 6, after announcing the handling of 2,221 problems, employees generally reflected that this movement was "short in flowering and quick in fruiting," and the enthusiasm for making suggestions was even higher. By the time the First Meeting of the Third Workers' Representative Assembly was held on September 15, the number of big-character posters in the plant had increased from 4,981 to 6,326. At this meeting, the Party Committee announced to the employees that it had handled another 3,041 problems. From then on, the "big blooming, big contending" movement has been developing normally, and even now, more than 200 big-character posters still appear every day.
    "Big Blooming, Big Contending," Rectifying While Correcting Influence Each Other and Promote Each Other
    Comprehensively analyzing the work of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in the previous stage of rectification, it can be seen that: believing in the masses and relying on the strength of the masses are the keys to "big blooming, big contending" and rectifying while correcting, and are the decisive factors for achieving victory. However, "big blooming, big contending" and rectifying while correcting influence each other and promote each other. The "big blooming, big contending" of the masses can force cadres to step up the improvement of work, and conversely, the actions of cadres to resolutely improve work and style encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for "big blooming, big contending." The two must be carried out simultaneously. Therefore, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant regards "big blooming, big contending" and rectifying while correcting as a stage of rectification. Now, most of the opinions raised by the workers in the plant have been handled, and the debate on certain issues has gradually increased on the big-character posters. On this basis, the Party Committee has turned the rectification movement to the third stage—the big debate—in order to solve the 1,190 problems left over that need to be debated, thereby raising the socialist consciousness of all employees in the plant.

    两个“坚定不移”
    本报记者　顾雷
    不平常的一个月
    石景山钢铁厂从8月23日开始大鸣大放，到9月26日基本结束。这是很不平常的一个月。在这一个月里，曾出现了大鸣大放的高潮和改进工作的高潮。在这一个月里所完成的事情，如果依靠过去老一套的工作方法，不知道要干多少个月呢！根据9月21日的统计，全厂共贴出大字报七千四百四十七张，召开各种座谈会一千三百八十二次，工人共提出问题二万零四百零八个，已经解决和即将解决的有一万五千零二个，占总数73.5％，平均每天解决问题五百个以上。这说明石景山钢铁厂的整风运动发展是正常的，工人和干部的热情是高涨的，解决问题的速度是非常快的。
    中共石景山钢铁厂委员会（下称党委会），在这一阶段做了不少的工作，最主要的是抓紧了政策思想的领导。如果把这种领导的内容概括起来，只有两句话：坚定不移地信任工人中的多数，放手地大鸣大放；坚定不移地贯彻边整边改的方针，狠狠地改进工作。
    这个厂的整风运动开始于5月下旬。当时，党委会曾在厂内召开了十九个座谈会，征求职工的意见，并且组织了五个专门小组，从生产技术管理、生活福利、工资奖励、党群关系等五个方面，分析研究企业内部的矛盾，着手解决这方面的一些问题。同时，又在职工中进行了反右派斗争的思想教育，对工人作了三次报告，组织职员进行了四十多天的学习。这两个多月的活动，对提高职工的阶级觉悟有不小的作用，对这次的大鸣大放也有不小帮助，可以说是大鸣大放的准备阶段。但是，在发动大鸣大放的时候，仍遇到不少的思想障碍。
    坚定不移地相信工人中的多数
    当时，在领导同志中间，有些人是有顾虑的，他们有些犹豫，怀疑大鸣大放后，工人是不是会放下工具，是不是会扰乱生产秩序，是不是会影响生产……。总之，怕工人闹起来。也有人怕工人鸣放不起来。为扫除这种思想障碍，党委会对全厂工人情况作了研究。全厂有八年工龄以上的老工人二千二百一十五人，约占工人总数的四分之一，他们有较高的阶级觉悟，是历次运动的骨干；三至七年工龄的工人有六千五百五十七人，占工人总数的70％左右，他们受过民主改革或总路的教育，大都能响应党的号召，积极参加各种运动；只有1954年以后入厂的六百八十九名青年工人，没有受过阶级教育，但所占的比例非常小。从生产方面看，1956年生铁的产量为1949年的十五点八四倍，这是工人爱护社会主义事业，进行英勇劳动的标志；再从党、团组织的状况看，党员、团员的人数占总人数50％以上。这不是普通的统计，而是工厂基本政治情况的定向器。
    分析了上述基本情况以后，工厂党委会相信绝大多数的工人会诚心诚意帮助党整风的，坚定了发动大鸣大放的决心，在领导干部中统一了对这个问题的认识。于是教育各级党的组织，教育各级领导干部要相信工人中的多数，要他们在思想上作接受各种批评的准备，不准急躁，更不准打击报复。同时，通过大会小会进行了两次全厂性的总动员，号召每个工人拿出主人翁的态度帮助党整风，用大字报揭发工作中的缺点，批评领导干部的官僚主义作风，要有什么说什么。为了解除群众怕领导干部给小鞋穿的顾虑，党委会向群众提出，绝对保证提意见的人不受到打击报复。
    鼓励工人用大字报的形式鸣放
    运动一开始，许多工人（包括一部分党团员）不习惯用大字报这个形式，觉得这个办法太激烈了。有人说：“都是自己人，有意见在小会上说说算了，何必贴出去呢！”这时，党委会便通过各支部，号召党员、团员、工会积极分子，带头用大字报给领导提意见。为了掀起大鸣大放的高潮，党委会特别指示各支部、各单位领导人员，为工人创造一切鸣放的条件。一方面继续动员、发给各种文具、在大小会议上宣扬大字报的作用，给写大字报的人以鼓励，另一方面，由于有许多人不会写字，于是也采用座谈会和访问等形式，给这些人提意见的机会，让他们把心里的话鸣放出来。从此，大字报一天比一天多起来。
    这时，有些被批评的人看到某些批评不够全面，或者语气偏激，提出：“被批评者能不能讲话呀？”党委会听到这种反映，为保护群众大鸣大放的热情，又在领导干部中提出：先听大家讲，不要忙着解释，即使听到错误的意见也不要马上反驳，主要的是要听取正确的批评，考虑如何改正自己的缺点。
    通过上述工作，全厂立刻掀起了大鸣大放的高潮。从8月23日到9月6日的十多天中，全厂有二千七百多人贴出了四千三百多张大字报，提出四千八百多条意见；在各种座谈会上有三千九百一十七人提出了一万一千七百五十七条意见。（在大鸣大放以前的两个多月的过程中，只有一百四十九人提出四百五十一条意见）。在提出的意见中，绝大部分是正确的，是属于生产和干部作风的。
    坚定不移地贯彻边整边改方针
    在整风过程中，如果说批判思想还需要一个过程，不是马上可以把全部问题都解决，那么在改进工作方面却万万不能如此。这不仅仅因为改进工作是整风的目的，还因为及时改进工作中的缺点，可以有力地推动大鸣大放，是继续开展鸣放的不可缺少的因素，是工人最最关心的问题。当一开始大鸣大放的时候，有些工人就说：“有些意见早提过了，就是不见改，真是陈土陈粪，越翻越没有劲！”这表现工人对领导上所说的边整边改缺乏信心。还有不少的工人没有完全解除怕打击报复的顾虑，因为他们没有看到领导上改进工作和作风的实际行动。党委会了解到这种情况后，即在全厂干部中宣布：坚定不移地贯彻边整边改的方针，狠狠地改进工作。具体的任务是：问题不分新老、大小，能马上改的马上改，不能马上改的制定改的计划，指定专人负责限期完成，向群众公布，做到条条意见都有交代。
    不分“新老”“大小”问题，条条都有交代
    为什么特别把“新老”和“大小”的问题提出来呢？因为当时有些干部认为大的问题应当解决，至于小的问题，可以放后些、放慢些。这些同志不了解工人提出一个意见，是经过一番考虑的，意见提出后总想看到结果，从他本人来说便是一件大心事，如果对这些意见不表示态度，就会挫伤群众提意见的积极性。至于那些拖了几年的问题，如果能马上解决，更可以使工人看到领导上改进工作的决心和诚意。例如，厂内为苹果园职工报时而设的汽笛，1955年就安好了，一直不用，工人提过多次意见。工人牛永顺9月5日提意见时说：“汽笛问题大家都快提腻了，就是没有人解决。上夜班的工人怕睡过了点，睡觉都睡不香，思想负担很重。”提意见后的第四天晚上，汽笛大喊大叫了。牛永顺高兴地说：“嗬！现在一鸣放它就响了！”又如，8月24日装卸工人熊舒贵贴出一张大字报：“小北门到洋灰洞的道，上下班不好走，下雨晚上更难走，希望领导上解决。”8月27号，运输部便动员了干部和电务组的同志，修了一条小马路，安了五盏电灯。工人们说：“还是大字报起作用，刚提出来，道就修好了！”对于这些老的、小的问题的解决，更鼓舞了工人鸣放的热情。洗煤工人李洪春对车间先进生产者评选工作提了个意见，支部马上找他谈话，表示接受批评，他接着又提了四条。
    依靠群众，大家动手解决问题
    为了保证解决问题及时、正确、全面，党委会注意扭转了运动初期只由少数干部忙着解决问题的做法，提出了依靠群众、大家动手的方针。比较有效的办法大体可分四种。第一、把解决问题的责任层层下放。除了一些重大的问题由厂或车间研究解决外，属于科室、工段、小组范围的问题便交给他们，由党的支部、科长、工段长或生产小组长吸收老工人、业务人员、职工代表等共同研究，提出处理意见，经总支委员会或厂部审查后执行。第二、发动各专业系统人员研究解决问题。在厂部由厂长和总工程师分别负责审查本系统问题的处理情况，各车间的职能人员分头负责了解和提出属于本专业问题的处理意见。属于设备的问题，发动修理工人和专业维护小组去解决。第三、对工人提出的建议，吸收提建议的人参加，共同提出方案，共同执行。第四、属于思想和工作作风上的问题，组织被批评者和批评者开座谈会或个别谈话，互相谈心，一方面接受批评，一方面解释某些误会，增进团结。这次受到批评的二百七十四个干部，开了一百二十六个座谈会，向一千二百三十九人作了检讨。在这四种处理问题的方法中，除第四种外，前三种方法所处理的问题（已解决的和正在解决的），都及时向群众公布。为了迅速处理问题，全厂抽调了二百五十余名干部参加各级整风办公室工作，最多时曾动员了九百六十四名干部连夜处理工人提出的问题。这样，大家提出的问题，由大家动手解决，因而就十分迅速，从而掀起了改进工作和作风的高潮。
    经过上述工作，石景山钢铁厂对已经集中的职工提出的意见，除了一部分提得不清楚，需要进一步调查，一部分转请上级机关解决，和一部分需要通过群众性辩论才能解决的问题外，所有的意见大都做到了条条有交代，件件有着落。这对于促进大鸣大放有决定性的影响。例如，在9月6日召开的第一届第二次职工代表会议上，宣布处理了二千二百二十一个问题之后，职工普遍反映这次运动是“开花短，结果快”，提意见的热情更高了。到9月15日召开的第一届第三次职工代表大会时，全厂的大字报已由四千九百八十一张增加到六千三百二十六张。在这次会议上，党委会向职工宣布，又处理了三千零四十一个问题。从此，大鸣大放运动一直是正常的发展，直到现在，每天仍有二百多张大字报出现。
    大鸣大放，边整边改互相影响，互相推动
    综合石景山钢铁厂整风前一阶段的工作，可以看出：相信群众、依靠群众的力量，是大鸣大放、边整边改的关键，是取得胜利的决定性因素。但是，大鸣大放，边整边改，是相互影响相互推动的，群众大鸣大放可以迫使干部加紧改进工作，反过来干部坚决改进工作和作风的行动，又鼓舞了群众大鸣大放的热情，两者必须同时进行。因此，石景山钢铁厂是把大鸣大放和边整边改当作整风的一个阶段进行的。现在，全厂工人提出的意见大部分已经处理，对于某些问题的争论在大字报上已逐渐增多，党委会便在这个基础上把整风运动转向第三个阶段——大辩论，以求解决遗留下来的需要辩论的一千一百九十个问题，由此提高全厂职工的社会主义觉悟。
