    In Memory of Comrade Liesli
    Li Bozhao

    In the autumn of 1953, one clear morning, the sunlight streamed onto the bedside, exactly at six o'clock, I heard the telephone ringing. I hurriedly got up to answer it. It was a comrade from the secretary's office of the Higher Education Department, saying that the Higher Education Department had hired a Soviet drama expert for the Drama Academy, who would report to the department at eight o'clock this morning, and invited Comrade Shakov and me to meet him. We didn't even have time for breakfast and arrived at the Higher Education Department at exactly 7:45. We hurried into the living room, which was empty. We were a little surprised. In less than five minutes, batches of Soviet experts arrived in the living room one after another, filling the room. This selfless assistance from the Soviet government was like sending charcoal in the snow. Our excitement and gratitude were hard to describe in words. We saw among the many Soviet experts one with a pair of large, sparkling eyes, a high forehead, bald, and a burly figure. We secretly guessed that he was probably the one for our academy! Coincidentally, a vocal music expert from the Conservatory of Music sitting near him was holding a small tuning fork in his hand, which further confirmed our conjecture. The Soviet chief advisor arrived and introduced each Soviet expert to us. As expected, we guessed right. Platon Vladimirovich Liesli was indeed a drama directing expert. He was a director at the Moscow Maly Theatre and a deputy professor at the Moscow Lunacharsky State Institute for Theatre Arts. He was the first Soviet expert hired by the Higher Education Department for the Central Academy of Drama. We warmly welcomed him. He smiled happily when he heard us speaking Russian to him. He humorously said to the vocal music expert: "Look! My luck is much better than yours. I have already found kindred spirits here, while you still don't know where your Conservatory of Music is?" We incidentally told the Soviet vocal music expert that the Conservatory of Music was not in Beijing, but in Tianjin, and it would take another two hours by train to get there. The vocal music expert also humorously said, "If I had known earlier that the Conservatory of Music was not in Beijing, I would have switched to studying drama." This sentence made everyone laugh. This first batch of experts from the Soviet Union to China were all assigned to teach in universities. Every face seemed familiar to me, as if I had seen them in Moscow, kind and approachable. With language as a bridge of friendship, we quickly began discussing work. Comrade Liesli asked us if we had recruited students and how many? He wanted to go to the academy immediately. It can be said that from the meeting at the Higher Education Department that day, he began to work.

    At the academy's welcoming party, he spoke little and humbly. He said, "I am an ordinary Soviet citizen, and also an ordinary drama worker. My mother is an actress. When I was five years old, I followed her in and out of the Maly Theatre. The Maly Theatre is like our home. I am a Soviet person, and I will work and study in accordance with the spirit of the Soviet people..."

    Liesli was the examiner of the directing training class students. He strictly evaluated the candidates, paying close attention to their political qualifications and their potential for professional development. He ridiculed those actors and directors who did not read newspapers and study current affairs: How can people who do not read newspapers observe things sensitively? He liked honest students. One candidate had not read many books, and failed the general knowledge test during the examination. He kindly asked the candidate: "So, young man, why don't you read books or read less?" The candidate answered bluntly: "Because I'm lazy." The expert smiled innocently and said seriously to the candidate: "For this honest answer, I have decided to admit you."

    How did expert Liesli train his students? His main focus was on training students in the method of observing life. He often had students do Beijing day observations, or performances, or narrations, or storytelling, and recreate what they observed in daily life with artistic techniques. He often used this novel method to train students to observe social life, to train students in collectivism, to love the motherland, and to love the people. His method was very successful. When I audited the class, I could vividly understand some specific changes and the details of people's lives that occurred in Beijing every day. The students observed workers, farmers, soldiers, and officers of the People's Liberation Army. They gradually progressed from observation to being able to write biographies of the objects they observed. This method of observation, analysis, and research enriched the students' knowledge of life and enriched the source of artistic creation.

    Expert Liesli was also very patient in training young teaching assistants. He taught the teaching and research section of the directing and acting department twice a week. Once he found that a young teaching assistant had made progress, he would tell the dean: "Don't bury talent. He is not who he was before. Don't be bureaucratic and turn a blind eye!" Under his guidance, several teaching assistants slowly became familiar with teaching from not knowing how to teach.

    Expert Liesli attached great importance to the academy's scientific research work. Under his suggestion and promotion, the academy's academic conference was established. Regarding the work tasks of the academic conference, he introduced in detail the experience of the Moscow Lunacharsky State Institute for Theatre Arts.

    Expert Liesli suggested that a practical indoor small theater be built according to the needs of teaching. Now, when the teaching programs of each grade in the directing and acting department are rehearsed there, people often think of expert Liesli.

    Expert Liesli's work style was enthusiastic, tenacious, persevering, and responsible. We never heard him say the word difficulty. Even when he was in pain. His teeth were very bad, it can be said that they had completely fallen out, so he ate bread with tea, able to chew even without teeth. He broke his leg and limped to class. He worked selflessly and intensely for more than two years.

    Expert Liesli directed three plays of different styles: the Soviet classic "Lyubov Yarovaya," the Italian Goldoni comedy "The Servant of Two Masters," and the Chinese play "The Peach Blossom Fan" by Ouyang Yuqian. They were staged and warmly welcomed and loved by people from all walks of life in the capital.

    Expert Liesli's students have worked all over the country. The construction work of the Drama Academy has received his great help, laying the foundation for socialist dramatic art education. During the days we spent together, we learned and worked honestly and friendly. We also had disputes from time to time, sometimes even arguing red-faced. After the arguments, we reconciled as before, all for the sake of work. We got along so well for more than two years. As the saying goes: "On festive occasions more than ever one thinks of one's dear ones." It is indeed the case. On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, we miss Comrade Liesli, the first expert sent to our academy by the Soviet Union, even more. Recently, we wrote to him and his wife, telling them: The maple leaves on the Western Hills of Beijing are red all over the mountains, and autumn has come again. Do you miss Beijing? Do you miss Chinese friends? Just as the Chinese poet described: "A bosom friend afar brings a distant land near." How close our hearts are to each other!

    怀念列斯里同志
    李伯钊
    1953年的秋天，一个晴朗的早晨，阳光射到床头，正六点，听见电话铃响了，赶忙爬起来接电话。高教部部长办公室秘书同志打来的，说高教部为戏剧学院聘请了一位苏联戏剧专家，今天早晨八时要到部里报到，邀我和沙可夫同志去接见。我们连早饭也没有来得及吃，正七点四十五分就赶到高教部。匆匆走进客厅，空空地没有一个人。我们有点儿奇怪，不到五分钟的光景，一批一批的苏联专家陆续走到客厅里来了，客厅里挤满了人，苏联政府这种无私的援助，正像雪里送炭，我们兴奋和感激的心情难以用语言来形容。我们看到许多苏联专家中一位有着一对大眼睛，目光闪闪，前额很高，秃顶，身材魁梧的专家，我们暗地猜想，大概他就是我们学院的吧！恰好同他附近坐着的一位音乐学院的声乐家，手上拿着一个小小的音叉，我们更确定了我们的看法。苏联总顾问来了，给我们介绍每个苏联专家，果然我们猜中了。普拉东·乌拉季米尔诺维奇·列斯里同志正是戏剧导演专家。他是莫斯科小剧院的导演，兼任莫斯科卢那恰尔斯基戏剧学院副教授。他就是高教部聘来中央戏剧学院的第一位苏联专家。我们热情地接待他，他一听我们同他说俄语，开心地笑了。他幽默地对声乐专家说：“瞧！我的运气比您强的多，这儿我已经找到了知己，而您却还不知道您的音乐学院在那儿？”我们顺便告诉那位苏联声乐专家音乐学院不在北京，在天津。还要坐两小时的火车才能到达。声乐专家也幽默地说：“假如我早些知道音乐学院不在北京，那我该改学戏剧了。”这句话逗得大家都笑了。这第一批从苏联到中国来的专家，全是到高等学校任教的，每一个面孔，我都似乎在莫斯科见过，面善而且亲切，加以言语成了友谊的桥梁，很快便谈工作了。列斯里同志问我们招收了学生没有？招了多少？他马上要到学院去。可以说从高教部那天会见起，他就开始投入工作了。
    在全院欢迎晚会上，他讲话少而谦虚，他说：“我是一个普通的苏联公民，也是一个普通的戏剧工作者，我的母亲是个演员，当我五岁时就同她在小剧院出出进进，小剧院像是我们的家。我是苏联人，一切按苏联人的精神来工作和学习。……”
    列斯里主考导演训练班的学生，他严格地鉴定考生，非常注意考生的政治条件和业务上发展的才能。他讥笑那些不读报不研究时事的演员与导演：不读报纸的人怎么能敏感地观察事物呢？他喜欢诚实的学生。有一个考生，读的书不多，考的时候，常识不及格，他亲切地询问考生：那么，青年人，你为什么不读书或者少读书呢？考生干脆地答道：“因为我懒。”专家天真地笑了，严肃地对考生说：“为你这句诚实的话，决定录取你。”
    列斯里专家如何训练学生呢？他主要的是训练学生善于观察生活的方法。他经常让学生作北京一日的观察或表演、或叙述、或讲故事，把一日观察生活所得，用艺术的手法再现。他常常用这种新颖的方法来训练学生观察社会生活，训练学生的集体主义精神，热爱祖国、热爱人民，他的方法是很成功的。当我旁听课的时候，每次都可以生动地了解北京每日所发生的一些具体的变化和人民的生活细节。学生们观察了工人、农民、战士和解放军的军官们。他们逐渐由观察到能给观察的对象写传略。这种观察、分析、研究的方法，使学生丰富了生活知识，丰富了艺术创造的泉源。
    列斯里专家还非常耐心地培养年青的助教，他每周为导表演系教研室上两次课。一旦他发现年青的助教有进步，他就告诉院长：“不要埋没了人材，他已经不是从前的他了，不要官僚主义视而不见吧！”在他的教导下，很有几个助教由不会教学，慢慢地熟习了教学了。
    列斯里专家对学院的科学研究工作极其重视。在他建议和推动之下，成立了院学术会议。关于学术会议的工作任务，他详尽地介绍了莫斯科卢那卡尔斯基戏剧学院的经验。
    列斯里专家建议按教学的需要，修建了经济实用的室内小剧场，现在导表演系各年级的教学剧目在那儿排演的时候，常常会想起列斯里专家来。
    列斯里专家的工作作风是热情、艰韧、顽强、负责的。我们从来没听见他说过困难两字。即是在他病痛的时候。他牙齿很坏，可以说完全脱落了，他便用面包就茶吃，没有牙也能咀嚼。他腿跌坏了，跛着脚也上课。他忘我地紧张地工作了两年多。
    列斯里专家导演了苏维埃经典著作：“柳鲍芙·雅洛瓦娅”、意大利哥尔多尼喜剧“一仆二主”和中国剧目欧阳予倩的“桃花扇”三个不同风格的剧目上演，受到首都各界热情的欢迎和喜爱。
    列斯里专家的学生已在全国各地工作了。戏剧学院建设的工作得到他大力的帮助，为奠定社会主义的戏剧艺术教育作了奠基的工作。在我们相处的日子里，我们诚实、友好地学习、工作，我们不时也发生争执，有时甚至争得面红耳赤，争论以后，我们又和好如初，一切为了工作，我们就这样友好地相处了二年多。俗话说：每逢佳节倍思亲，果真是这样，值十月革命四十周年之际，我们更想念苏联派给我们学院的第一位专家列斯里同志。最近我们写信给他和他的夫人，告诉他们：北京西山的枫叶遍山红了，秋天又来了。想北京吗？想中国朋友吗？正像中国诗人所描写的：“海内存知己，天涯若比邻。”我们彼此的心是多么近呵！
