	The Socialist Revolution is a Fundamental Transformation of Politics, Economics, and Ideology
	—In Commemoration of the Fortieth Anniversary of the Victory of the October Revolution
	Fan Ruoyu

	November 7, 1917, is a day marking a turning point in human history. In the past history of human society, there have been many revolutions, and each revolution has advanced social life; however, the role played by any past revolution in history cannot be compared with the October Socialist Revolution that took place in Russia in 1917. The October Revolution opened up a new historical period for mankind, namely the period of socialism-communism. Compared with this new historical period opened up by the October Revolution, the past thousands of years of human civilization history are merely the early history of mankind. Only through socialist revolution can we enter a new historical period. Engels pointed out: "Only a conscious organization of social production in which planned production and planned distribution are possible can elevate man from the rest of the animal world in social relations, just as production in general has elevated man from the rest of the animal world in species relations. ... In this new historical period, people themselves and all aspects of their activities, including natural science, will make great progress, like the rising sun, shining all over the world, making everything in the past disappear in the darkness"? The October Socialist Revolution was precisely a revolution that elevated man from the rest of the animal world in social relations, and November 7, 1917, this radiant day, was precisely a day like the rising sun shining all over the world, making everything in the past gradually disappear in the darkness.

	From this great historical change of the October Revolution, people saw the profound content of the socialist revolution. Prior to this, no revolution had undergone such profound changes in politics, economics, and ideology as the October Revolution, nor had any revolution mobilized as many people as the October Revolution. The October Socialist Revolution was the first profound and extensive real people's revolution in human history.

	The October Socialist Revolution was a fundamental transformation of the political system of human society. This revolution completely destroyed the political rule of the bourgeoisie and established the dictatorship of the proletariat, thereby creating the world's first socialist country and opening up the road from capitalist society to the classless communist society.

	Lenin pointed out: "The fundamental issue of all revolutions is the issue of state power"? Therefore, seizing power to become the ruling class is not a phenomenon unique to the proletarian revolution, but a phenomenon common to all previous revolutions. However, the reason why the previous revolutionary classes wanted to overthrow the old state power and establish their own state power was only to replace the old form of exploitation with their own form of exploitation, while the seizure of power by the proletariat in the October Revolution was to eliminate all forms of exploitation. All previous state powers were tools used by this or that exploiting class to suppress the working people, while the state power created by the October Revolution was a tool used by the proletariat to suppress the resistance of the exploiting classes. All previous state powers were machines by which a minority oppressed the majority, while the state power created by the October Revolution was a machine by which the majority oppressed the minority. All previous state powers only guaranteed the democratic rights of the minority, while the state power created by the October Revolution guaranteed the democratic rights of the majority.

	The bourgeois revolution once replaced the feudal state power with its own state power. However, since both the bourgeoisie and the feudal class are exploiting classes, and both the bourgeois state power and the feudal state power are machines for oppressing the working people, the bourgeoisie can simply seize the existing feudal state machine to serve itself. Especially when the bourgeoisie is threatened by the proletarian movement, the bourgeoisie will compromise with the feudal class and share power. Lenin said that the "complete victory" of the bourgeois revolution "would be so dangerous for the bourgeoisie that the proletariat would use full freedom to oppose the bourgeoisie, and the more complete the freedom and the more thorough the elimination of the landlords' power, the easier it would be to use this freedom. Therefore, the bourgeoisie tries its best to end the bourgeois revolution halfway, when it gets half freedom, and colludes with the old regime and the landlords. The root of this attempt lies in the class interests of the bourgeoisie"?

	Contrary to the bourgeois revolution, the class interests of the proletariat require that all power must be obtained in the revolution and the bourgeois state machine must be completely smashed. It is impossible for the proletariat to use the old state machine to serve itself. Therefore, the proletarian revolution must never replace revolution with reform and struggle with compromise like the general bourgeois revolution. We know that in the political changes of the October Revolution, the most important and main institutions of the bourgeoisie, namely the old-style army and its leadership group, were smashed, and the proletarian state established its own workers' and peasants' Red Army. Another equally important bureaucratic institution of the bourgeoisie, namely the bourgeois administrative institution, was also smashed, and the proletariat established its own Soviet management organs. In this way, the proletariat completely overthrew the bourgeoisie's political rule and established the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat on the basis of a solid alliance with the peasants. The practice of the October Revolution proves that the proletariat must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, unite with the working people and seize power from the bourgeoisie through revolutionary struggle.

	Does the proletariat's seizure of power mean the end of the revolution? No, on the contrary, the proletariat's seizure of power is only the beginning of the revolution. On this issue, the proletarian revolution is also very different from the bourgeois revolution, because the bourgeois revolution usually ends with the seizure of power.

	The capitalist economy spontaneously occurred and matured within the feudal society. The task of the bourgeois revolution is only to clear the obstacles on the road to the development of capitalism to strengthen the process of capitalist development. Therefore, the bourgeoisie can complete this task by seizing power. The proletarian revolution cannot do this, because the socialist economy cannot be produced within the old society based on private ownership of the means of production. Only after the proletariat seizes power can it begin to transform the old economy and establish a socialist economy. Therefore, the proletariat's seizure of power is only the beginning of the revolution. In addition, on the first day of seizing power, the proletariat must begin to fight to maintain and consolidate its power. We must not forget that the bourgeois reactionaries overthrown by the October Revolution and all the reactionary forces unwilling to perish once united to resist the Soviet regime and colluded with foreign aggressors to carry out armed intervention. It was because the proletariat used dictatorial means to suppress those reactionaries and all those who harbored ulterior motives, and prepared strong forces, that it thoroughly defeated those reactionaries and interventionists and crushed the enemy's attempt to restore power when the incident occurred, thus maintaining and consolidating the proletarian regime. From this it can be seen that in order to unite all workers to carry out socialist construction and achieve the goal of eliminating classes, the proletariat must struggle to consolidate and strengthen the proletariat's leadership over all aspects of the country, and must struggle to overcome the bourgeoisie's influence on the masses. It is obviously not understanding what the proletarian revolution is if one thinks that the proletarian revolution is completed once the proletariat seizes power and there will be no more political struggles.

	The fundamental changes in the political system brought about by the October Revolution created the preconditions for fundamental changes in the economic system. This fundamental change in the economic system is to eliminate the economic system of human exploitation based on private ownership of the means of production and to establish a socialist economic system based on public ownership of the means of production.

	The law that the relations of production must be adapted to the nature of the productive forces is the law of social progress. Therefore, changing the old relations of production, that is, changing the old economic system to adapt to the nature of the productive forces, is not a phenomenon unique to the proletarian revolution, but a phenomenon common to all revolutions. However, all previous revolutions to adapt the relations of production to the nature of the productive forces could only replace the old forms with a new form of private ownership and exploitation system, while the socialist revolution to adapt the relations of production to the nature of the productive forces must completely eliminate private ownership of the means of production, eliminate all forms of exploitation, and eliminate classes, and replace them with a socialist economic system based on public ownership of the means of production. Therefore, before the October Revolution, although many economic changes had taken place in human society, private ownership and exploitation systems still existed. Only the October Revolution eliminated the private ownership system, the exploitation system, and the exploiting classes for the first time.

	The bourgeois revolution once replaced the feudal ownership system with the capitalist ownership system, and the capitalist form of exploitation with the feudal form of exploitation; however, in many capitalist countries, the bourgeoisie basically preserved the feudal economy in agriculture, only making it adapt to the conditions of the capitalist system. Although these preserved feudal economies gradually adopted capitalist management methods and used wage labor, they still retained feudal exploitation methods and the form of landlord exploitation of peasants. Generally speaking, since the bourgeoisie has made the capitalist economic system dominate social life, it does not feel necessary to completely eliminate the feudal economy in all aspects. The bourgeoisie prefers to retain certain feudal economic factors as supplementary factors for its exploitation of the working people. In developed capitalist countries, there are also a large number of small farmers, precisely because the bourgeoisie is willing to retain poor peasants who occupy small plots of land in order to exploit them. Contrary to the bourgeois revolution, the proletarian revolution must completely eliminate all old economic systems, because any old economic system based on private ownership of the means of production is incompatible with the socialist system. The October Revolution, on the one hand, implemented the nationalization of industry, turning the means of production in the hands of the bourgeoisie into public property, thereby completely eliminating the bourgeoisie's economic rule; on the other hand, it transitioned the individual small private economy to the socialist collective economy through the road of cooperation, thereby blocking the roots of capitalism and exploitation, and enabling peasants to get rid of exploitation and poverty forever and embark on the road to a prosperous and cultured life. In this way, with the realization of the public ownership of all means of production, the laws of mutual competition and anarchy of production under the capitalist system also lost their effectiveness, and the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy was generated.

	The practice of the October Revolution proves that the implementation of industrial nationalization and agricultural collectivization laid the foundation for the socialist economic system. However, the consolidation and development of the socialist economic system must also rely on the development of industrial production and agricultural production. The development of socialist industrial production and socialist agricultural production is a material guarantee for the complete elimination of capitalist elements, and Lenin pointed out: "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and fundamental condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system. ... Capitalism can be completely defeated, and will certainly be completely defeated, because socialism can create new and much higher labor productivity"? Therefore, only by vigorously developing socialist industrial production and socialist agricultural production, that is, vigorously improving labor productivity, can we guarantee the complete victory of the socialist economic system.

	The October Revolution was not only a fundamental change in the political and economic systems of society, but also a fundamental change in ideology. The victory of the October Revolution was the victory of Marxism-Leninism, that is, the ideology of the proletariat, over the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all non-proletarian ideologies.

	Social ideology is a reflection of the material living conditions of society. Marx and Engels said: "The ruling ideas of every age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class"? Therefore, making the ideas of its own class the dominant ideas is not a phenomenon unique to the proletarian revolution, but a phenomenon common to all revolutions. However, all previous ruling class ideas were the ideas of the exploiting classes, and were ideas that maintained the exploitation system. Only through the socialist revolution did the ideas of the exploited working people rise to the ruling ideas in society for the first time.

	The bourgeois revolution once replaced the rule of feudal ideas with the ideas of the bourgeoisie. Historically, when the bourgeoisie was still in the revolutionary era, although its ideas essentially reflected its own exploitative demands, it did put forward a number of new viewpoints and slogans, criticized the feudal system, and played a positive role in promoting the progress of history. However, on the fundamental issue of worldview, the bourgeoisie and the feudal ruling class were not without common ground. The bourgeoisie never forgot to take the various traditional ideas of the past to serve itself. Especially when the proletarian movement threatened the existence of the capitalist system, the bourgeoisie tried its best to find the common ground between it and feudal ideas. As a result, people saw the phenomenon of the bourgeoisie's ideological restoration. Contrary to the bourgeois revolution, the October Socialist Revolution realized a fundamental change in thought. As early as before the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Party conducted revolutionary education in Marxism-Leninism to the broad masses of workers and peasants through theoretical and practical struggles, using various forms, thereby making ideological preparations for the victory of the October Revolution. After the victory of the October Revolution, when the various departments of social life underwent socialist transformation, the ideological transformation of the broad masses further involved all aspects of morality, customs, habits, psychology, and worldview. For example, in the past, the public believed that exploitation was a glorious and enviable thing, but now the public believes that it is a despicable and shameful thing; in the past, the public believed that labor was a lowly and shameful thing, but now the public believes that it is a glorious and respectable thing. This shows that due to the fundamental changes in politics and economy, fundamental changes in people's thinking cannot but be caused, and the fundamental changes in thinking also promote and promote the fundamental changes in politics and economy.

	The practice of the October Revolution shows that the socialist ideas of the broad masses of people are a reflection of the socialist way of life. However, the victory of socialist ideas cannot be realized spontaneously and freely, but is achieved in the continuous struggle of Marxism-Leninism against the ideas of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, and is achieved in the long-term and systematic education of the Party and the state. Because the influence of the private ownership system passed down from generation to generation and the habitual forces of millions of people cannot be easily eliminated. Therefore, after the socialist revolution achieves victory on the political and economic fronts, the struggle on the ideological front is still continuing. If the struggle on the ideological front is ignored and the work of conducting socialist ideological education among the people is ignored, it will bring great damage to the socialist cause. Marxism-Leninism has always emphasized that the socialist revolution must not only thoroughly transform the political and economic systems, but also change people themselves, that is, transform people's thinking and consciousness. Marx and Engels pointed out: “The communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas”?. That is to say, the socialist revolution must complete the fundamental transformation of thought.

	The October Socialist Revolution is a fundamental transformation of the political, economic, and ideological aspects of human society. Each aspect of this fundamental transformation is directly related to the vital interests of millions of people, and is a movement in which the broad masses of people consciously create history. Marx and Engels pointed out long ago: "All previous movements have been movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the independent movement of the vast majority, in the interest of the vast majority"? This is also the most prominent and main feature of the socialist revolution.

	The bourgeois revolution never dared to seriously mobilize the broad masses. The bourgeoisie sometimes needs the masses, but it does so in order to use the strong arms of the masses to take chestnuts from the fire for it. When the bourgeoisie coaxes the masses, it always dresses itself up as the representative of society and portrays the bourgeois revolution as a revolution of the whole people; however, once the masses realize that they have fallen into another exploitative system and try to make the revolution go beyond the narrow scope of the bourgeois revolution, the bourgeoisie will use dictatorial means to suppress the people. Therefore, the bourgeoisie usually mobilizes the masses as little as possible in the revolution, and is keen to adopt top-down methods in order to end the revolution with compromise and reform. Contrary to the bourgeois revolution, the October Revolution was an unprecedented real people's revolution. Never in history has any revolution mobilized so many people as the October Revolution, and these broad masses of people have shown such conscious and organized action. People know that when the October Revolution broke out in 1917, the Bolshevik Party had only 240,000 members, accounting for only one-thousandth of the Russian population. Of course, it cannot be imagined that only such a small number of people could overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie for the first time in a country with a population of 200 million and occupying one-sixth of the world's land. The reason why the Bolshevik Party was able to realize such a great revolutionary cause was that it fully mobilized the masses and skillfully combined the then Russian peasant democratic movement, the liberation movement of ethnic minorities, the peace movement of all ethnic groups against the imperialist war, and the socialist movement of the proletariat, merging them into the general revolutionary torrent and achieving victory.

	After the victory of the October Revolution, Lenin pointed out that it is impossible to build socialism according to the orders issued from above by a few people, and that vigorous and creative socialism is the creation of the people themselves. In the past, the work of building a capitalist society was carried out by a minority of the bourgeoisie and its intellectuals, mainly "because the capitalist society, built on anarchy, had a domestic market and an international market that were spontaneously developing in depth and breadth as its basic organizational forces"? Socialism, however, does not have this spontaneously pre-formed economic relationship as its strength. It has only another strength, namely the great creative power of the masses. The October Revolution opened up an incomparably vast world for giving play to the initiative of the masses, and in the face of the initiative of the broad masses, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. People still remember how the Soviet people took solid steps to build socialism under the threat of possible invasion by imperialism at any time and with the national economy severely damaged, and began the magnificent cause that was once considered an "absolute fantasy" and "fundamentally impossible" by the international bourgeoisie. Because the Bolshevik Party resolutely implemented the policy of trusting the masses and relying on the masses, it achieved extremely brilliant achievements in industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and cultural revolution. Lenin said well, the masses of the people are capable of miracles.

	The practice of the October Revolution proves that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working people are the basic force determining social change. The task of the Communist Party is to consistently educate the masses, care for the interests of the masses, and summarize the creative experience of the masses. Once the masses understand their own tasks and actively act, the Party can lead them to overcome difficulties and achieve a complete victory in the revolution.

	When the working people of the world join the Soviet people in celebrating the 40th anniversary of the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, our people are in the midst of a high tide of socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. In 1949, our country had already established a people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance, that is, the dictatorship of the proletariat. In 1956, it had also basically completed the socialist revolution on the economic front, that is, in the ownership of the means of production. At present, we are using the form of a nationwide debate to conduct a thorough socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. This is a nationwide debate on the issue of the two roads of socialism and capitalism. The socialist revolutionary movement on the political and ideological fronts is a movement to thoroughly oppose the bourgeois rightists, further strengthen the leadership of the proletariat among all the people, and conscientiously overcome the style of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. It is a movement to conduct profound socialist ideological education among all the people, systematically criticize bourgeois ideology, and raise the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of people. Only by winning the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts can we eliminate the serious obstacles to our socialist construction, consolidate and strengthen our country's socialist system, and greatly promote our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Just when our country is carrying out the socialist revolutionary movement on the political and ideological fronts, it is beneficial for us to study the historical significance of the October Revolution, distinguish the fundamental difference between the socialist revolution and the bourgeois revolution, understand the profound content of the socialist revolution, to criticize the reactionary words and deeds of the rightists, to conduct socialist ideological education to the broad masses of people, and to strive for the complete victory of our country's socialist revolution on the political, economic, and ideological fronts. Marx said: "This socialism is to declare the continuous revolution, to realize the dictatorship of the proletariat, as a necessary transitional stage, in order to achieve the fundamental elimination of class differences, to eliminate all the relations of production from which these differences arise, to eliminate all social relations adapted to these relations of production, and to transform all the ideas arising from these social relations"? That is to say, the socialist revolution is to completely eliminate the bourgeoisie politically, economically, and ideologically, and to establish a socialist society without exploitation and without classes. The October Socialist Revolution did this thoroughly, and we must also do it thoroughly.

    社会主义革命是政治、经济和思想的根本变革
    ——纪念十月革命胜利四十周年
    范若愚
    1917年11月7日，这是一个标志着人类历史的转折点的日子。在已往的人类社会历史上，也曾经有过多次的革命，每一次革命都使社会生活向前推进了一步；但是，过去的任何一次革命在历史上所起的作用，都不能同1917年俄国发生的十月社会主义革命相比拟。十月革命为人类开辟了一个新的历史时期，就是社会主义——共产主义的时期。同十月革命所开辟的这个新的历史时期相比较，过去几千年来的人类文明历史不过是人类的前期历史。只有经过社会主义革命才进入新的历史时期。恩格斯指出：“只有一个在其中能够有计划地生产和有计划地分配的有意识的社会生产组织，才能在社会关系方面把人从其余的动物中提升出来，正像一般生产曾经在物种关系方面把人从其余动物中提升出来一样。……在这个新的历史时期中，人们自身以及他们的活动的一切方面，包括自然科学在内，将获得极大的进步，有如旭日东升，照遍天下，使已往的一切都消失在阴暗之中”?。十月社会主义革命，正是一次在社会关系方面把人从其余动物中提升出来的革命，1917年11月7日这个光芒万丈的日子，正是一个有如旭日东升照遍天下使已往的一切都开始逐渐消失在阴暗之中的日子。
    从十月革命这次伟大的历史变革中，人们看到了社会主义革命的深刻的内容。在此以前，没有任何一次革命在政治、经济和思想等方面有过像十月革命那样深刻的变革，也没有任何一次革命发动过像十月革命那样众多的人民群众。十月社会主义革命乃是人类历史上第一次深刻而广泛的真正的人民革命。
    十月社会主义革命是人类社会政治制度的根本变革。这个革命彻底摧毁了资产阶级的政治统治，建立起无产阶级的专政，从而创立了世界上的第一个社会主义国家，开辟了从资本主义社会通向消灭阶级的共产主义社会的大道。
    列宁指出：“一切革命的根本问题，就是国家政权问题”?。因此，夺取政权使自己成为统治的阶级，这并不是无产阶级革命所独有的现象，而是从前一切革命所共有的现象。但是，从前各个进行革命的阶级所以要推翻旧的国家政权并建立自己的国家政权，只是为了要以自己的剥削形式代替旧的剥削形式，而十月革命由无产阶级夺取政权，则是为了要消灭一切剥削形式。从前所有的国家政权都是这个剥削阶级或者那个剥削阶级用以镇压劳动人民的工具，而十月革命所创立的国家政权则是无产阶级用以镇压剥削阶级的反抗的工具。从前所有的一切国家政权都是少数人压迫多数人的机器，而十月革命所创立的国家政权则是大多数人压迫少数人的机器。从前所有的一切国家政权只是保障少数人的民主权利，而十月革命所创立的国家政权则是保障大多数人的民主权利。
    资产阶级革命，曾经以自己的国家政权代替了封建的国家政权。可是，由于资产阶级和封建阶级都是剥削阶级，资产阶级的国家政权同封建的国家政权都是压迫劳动人民的机器，所以，资产阶级就可以简单地握取现成的封建国家机器来为自己服务。特别是当资产阶级受到无产阶级运动威胁的时候，资产阶级就会同封建阶级相互妥协、分享政权。列宁说过，资产阶级革命“彻底的胜利对于资产阶级会有这样的危险：无产阶级会利用充分的自由来反对资产阶级，并且自由愈充分，消灭地主的政权愈彻底，也就愈易利用这种自由。所以，资产阶级极力想在半途中，得到一半自由时，就结束资产阶级革命，而与旧政权和地主勾结起来。这种企图的根源就在于资产阶级的阶级利益”?。
    同资产阶级革命相反，无产阶级的阶级利益要求在革命中必须取得全部政权，并且彻底打碎资产阶级的国家机器。无产阶级不可能利用旧的国家机器来为自己服务，因此，无产阶级革命决不能像一般的资产阶级革命那样以改良代替革命，以妥协代替斗争。我们知道，在十月革命的政治变革中，资产阶级的头等重要的和最主要的机构，即旧式军队和它的将领集团都被打碎了，无产阶级的国家建立了自己的工农红军。资产阶级的另一个同样重要的官僚机构，即资产阶级的行政机构也被打碎了，无产阶级建立起自己的苏维埃管理机关。这样，无产阶级就彻底推翻了资产阶级在政治上的统治，而在同农民结成巩固联盟的基础上建立起无产阶级专政的国家来。十月革命的实践证明，无产阶级必须在共产党的领导下，联合劳动人民，经过革命斗争从资产阶级手里取得政权。
    无产阶级取得了政权，是不是就意味着革命的结束呢？不是的，恰恰相反，无产阶级取得政权只是革命的开始。在这个问题上，无产阶级革命也同资产阶级革命有着极大的区别，因为资产阶级革命通常是以取得政权结束的。
    资本主义经济在封建社会的内部就自发地发生和成熟起来了，资产阶级革命的任务，只是为了扫清资本主义发展道路上的障碍以加强资本主义发展的进程，因此，资产阶级取得了政权就能完成这个任务。无产阶级革命却不能这样，因为社会主义经济不能在以生产资料私有制为基础的
  旧社会内部产生，无产阶级取得政权以后，才开始改造旧的经济建立社会主义的经济。所以，无产阶级取得政权才是革命的开始。此外，无产阶级在取得政权的第一天，就必须开始为保持和巩固自己的政权而斗争。我们不能忘记，被十月革命所推翻了的资产阶级反动派和一切不甘心于灭亡的反动势力，曾经联合起来向苏维埃政权进行过反抗，并且勾结了外国侵略者进行了武装干涉。由于无产阶级运用专政手段镇压了那些反动派和一切图谋不轨的分子，并且准备了雄厚的力量，才在事变发生的时候，彻底击败了那些反动派和干涉者，粉碎了敌人的复辟企图，保持和巩固了无产阶级的政权。由此可知，无产阶级为了要团结一切劳动者进行社会主义建设，达到消灭阶级的目的，就必须为巩固和加强无产阶级对国家一切方面的领导权而斗争，就必须为克服资产阶级对群众的影响而斗争。如果以为无产阶级取得政权就算完成了无产阶级革命，就不会再有什么政治斗争，那显然是不了解什么是无产阶级革命。
    十月革命在政治制度方面所实现的根本变革，为实现经济制度方面的根本变革创造了前提条件。这种经济制度的根本变革，就是要消灭以生产资料私有制为基础的人剥削人的经济制度，建立以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义经济制度。
    生产关系一定要适合生产力的性质是社会向前发展的规律。因此，改变旧的生产关系，即改变旧的经济制度以适合生产力的性质，这也不是无产阶级革命所独有的现象，而是一切革命所共有的现象。但是，从前一切革命使生产关系适合生产力的性质，只能是以私有制度和剥削制度的一种新的形式来代替旧的形式，而社会主义革命使生产关系适合生产力的性质，则必须是彻底消灭生产资料私有制、消灭一切剥削形式、消灭阶级，而代之以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义经济制度。因此，在十月革命以前，人类社会虽然发生过多次的经济变革，可是私有制度和剥削制度却依然存在着。只有十月革命才第一次消灭了私有制度，消灭了剥削制度，消灭了剥削阶级。
    资产阶级革命，曾经以资本主义所有制代替了封建所有制，以资本主义的剥削形式代替了封建的剥削形式；但是，在不少的资本主义国家里，资产阶级在农业中把封建经济基本上保存下来，只是使它适应于资本主义制度的条件。这些被保存下来的封建经济，虽然逐渐采取了资本主义的经营方式，使用雇佣劳动，但至今仍保留着封建的剥削方法，保留着地主对农民的剥削形式。一般说来，资产阶级既已做到了使资本主义经济制度在社会生活中居于统治地位，就不感到有必要在一切方面彻底消灭封建经济了。资产阶级宁愿保留某些封建经济因素，作为它剥削劳动人民的补充因素。在资本主义发达的国家里，也还有大量的小农户存在，这正是因为资产阶级愿意保留占有小块份地的贫苦农民，以便于剥削他们。同资产阶级革命相反，无产阶级革命必须彻底消灭一切旧的经济制度，因为任何以生产资料私有制为基础的旧经济制度都是不能同社会主义制度相容的。十月革命，一方面实行了工业国有化，把资产阶级手中的生产资料变成了公共的财产，从而彻底地消灭了资产阶级在经济上的统治；另一方面通过合作化的道路，把个体的小私有经济过渡到社会主义的集体经济，从而堵塞了产生资本主义、产生剥削现象的根源，使农民永远摆脱了剥削和贫困而走向富裕的、有文化的生活道路。这样，随着一切生产资料公有化的实现，资本主义制度下的相互竞争和生产的无政府状态的法则也就失去效力，而产生了国民经济有计划按比例发展的法则。
    十月革命的实践证明，实行工业国有化和农业集体化，就奠定了社会主义经济制度的基础。但是，社会主义经济制度的巩固和发展，还必须依靠工业生产和农业生产的发展。社会主义工业生产和社会主义农业生产的发展，乃是彻底消灭资本主义成分的物质保证。列宁指出：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重
  要最主要的条件。……资本主义可以被彻底战胜，而且一定会被彻底战胜，是因为社会主义能造成新的更高得多的劳动生产率”?。因此，只有大力发展社会主义的工业生产和社会主义的农
  业生产，即大力提高劳动生产率，才能保证社会主义经济制度的彻底胜利。
      十月革命不仅是社会政治制度和经济制度的根本变革，而且也是意识形态的根本变革。十月革命的胜利，是马克思列宁主义即无产阶级的意识形态对于资产阶级的意识形态和一切非无产阶级的意识形态的胜利。
      社会意识形态是社会物质生活条件的反映。马克思和恩格斯说：“任何一个时代的统治思想都不过是统治阶级的思想”?。因此，使本阶级的思想成为占居统治地位的思想，也不是无产阶级革命所独有的现象，而是一切革命所共有的现象。但是，从前一切统治阶级的思想，都是剥削阶级的思想，都是维护剥削制度的思想。只有经过社会主义革命，被剥削的劳动人民的思想才第一次上升为社会上的统治思想。
      资产阶级革命，曾经以资产阶级的思想代替了封建思想的统治。历史地来看，当资产阶级还在革命的时代，尽管它的思想实质上是反映了自身的剥削要求，但是它确曾提出了若干新的观点和口号，抨击了封建制度，对推动历史的前进起了积极的作用。可是，在世界观这个根本问题上，资产阶级同封建的统治阶级并不是没有相通的地方的。资产阶级也始终没有忘记把已往的种种传统思想拿来为自己服务。特别是当无产阶级运动威胁到资本主义制度存在的时候，资产阶级就尽量找寻它和封建思想的共同之点，于是，人们就看到了资产阶级在思想上的复古现象。同资产阶级革命相反，十月社会主义革命实现了思想的根本变革。早在十月革命以前，布尔什维克党就通过理论的、实践的斗争，运用种种形式向广大的工人群众和农民群众进行了马克思列宁主义的革命教育，从而为十月革命的胜利做了思想上的准备。在十月革命胜利以后，当社会生活的各部门进行社会主义改造的时候，广大群众的思想变革就更进一步涉及到道德、风俗、习惯、心理以及世界观等各个方面。例如，从前公众认为剥削是荣耀的、使人羡慕的事情，现在公众则认为是卑鄙的、令人可耻的事情；从前公众认为劳动是下贱的、令人可耻的事情，现在公众则认为是光荣的、使人尊敬的事情。这说明了由于政治和经济的根本变革，不能不引起人们思想的根本变革，而思想的根本变革也推动和促进了政治的和经济的根本变革。
    十月革命的实践说明，广大人民群众的社会主义思想是社会主义生活方式的反映。但是，社会主义的思想的胜利，不可能是自发地、自流地实现的，而是在以马克思列宁主义的思想同资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想进行不断的斗争中取得的，是在党和国家长期的、有系统的教育中取得的。因为世代相传下来的私有制的影响，千百万人的习惯势力，不是很容易地就能扫除了的。因此，社会主义革命在政治战线和经济战线上取得胜利以后，思想战线上的斗争也还在继续着。如果忽视了思想战线上的斗争，忽视了对人民群众进行社会主义思想教育的工作，就会给社会主义事业带来极大的损害。马克思列宁主义始终强调社会主义革命不仅要彻底地变革政治制度和经济制度，而且必须改变人们自身，即变革人们的思想意识。马克思和恩格斯指出：“共产主义革命就是同过去遗传下来的所有制关系实行最彻底的决裂；所以，毫不奇怪的，它在自己的发展进程中要同过去遗传下来的种种观念实行最彻底的决裂”?。这也就是说，社会主义革命必须完成思想上的根本变革。
    十月社会主义革命是人类社会政治的、经济的、思想的根本变革。这一根本变革的每一个方面，都直接关系到千百万人民群众的切身利益，都是广大人民群众自觉地创造历史的运动。马克思和恩格斯早经指出：“迄今所发生过的一切运动都是少数人的运动，或为少数人谋利益的运动。无产阶级的运动是绝大多数人为绝大多数人谋利益的独立的运动”?。这里说的，也正是社会主义革命的一个最显著的、最主要的特点。
    资产阶级革命决不敢认真地发动广大的群众。资产阶级有时也需要群众，但为的是利用群众粗壮的臂膀为它火中取栗。当资产阶级笼络群众的时候，总是把自己装扮成社会的代表，把资产阶级革命说成是全民的革命；然而，一当群众察觉到自己又落入另一种剥削制度的陷井而力图使革命越出资产阶级革命的狭隘范围的时候，资产阶级就以专政手段来镇压人民。所以，资产阶级通常是使革命尽少发动群众，而热衷于采取自上而下的方法，以期用妥协和改良来结束革命。同资产阶级革命相反，十月革命乃是一次空前的真正的人民革命。历史上还未曾有过任何一次革命像十月革命那样发动了如此众多的人民群众，而这些广大的人民群众表现出了如此自觉的、有组织的行动。人们知道，当1917年十月革命爆发的时候，布尔什维克党不过有二十四万党员，只占俄国人口的千分之一多些。当然不能设想只靠这样微少的人数，就能在一个拥有两亿人口而占全世界六分之一的土地上首次推翻了资产阶级的统治。布尔什维克党之所以能实现这样伟大的革命事业，就因为它充分地发动了群众，巧妙地把当时俄国的农民民主运动，少数民族的解放运动，各族人民反对帝国主义战争的和平运动以及无产阶级的社会主义运动，汇合成为总的革命巨流而取得了胜利。
    十月革命胜利以后，列宁就指出，按照少数人从上面发下来的命令不可能建成社会主义，生气勃勃的、创造性的社会主义是人民群众本身的创造物。在过去，建设资本主义社会的工作，是由占人口中少数的资产阶级及其知识分子来执行的，这主要“因为那建筑在无政府状态上的资本主义社会，有了在深度和广度方面都是自发发展着的国内市场和国际市场为其基本的组织力量”?。社会主义却没有这种自发地、事先已经形成的经济关系为其力量，它有的只是另一种力量，即群众的伟大创造力量。十月革命为发挥群众的积极性开辟了无比广阔的天地，而在广大群众的积极性面前，是没有什么克服不了的困难的。人们都还记得，苏联人民当时在帝国主义随时可能侵犯的威胁下，在国民经济遭受严重破坏的情况下，是怎样迈出了建设社会主义的雄壮步伐，开始了曾被国际资产阶级认为是“绝对幻想”和“根本不能实现”的宏伟事业的。由于布尔什维克党坚决执行了相信群众、依靠群众的方针，所以在工业化、农业集体化和文化革命等方面就取得了极其辉煌的成就。列宁说得好，人民群众是能够作出奇迹的。
    十月革命的实践证明，在共产党的领导下，劳动人民是决定社会变革的基本力量。共产党的任务就在于一贯地教育群众，关心群众的利益，总结群众的创造经验。一当群众了解到自身的任务而积极行动起来的时候，党就可以领导他们克服困难使革命获得彻底的胜利。
    当全世界劳动人民同苏联人民一起庆祝十月社会主义革命胜利四十周年的时候，我国人民正处在一个政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的高潮中。1949年，我国已经建立起无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，也就是无产阶级专政。1956年，又已经基本上完成了经济战线上亦即生产资料所有制上的社会主义革命。目前，我们正在用全民大辩论的形式，来深入地进行在政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命。这是一场关于社会主义同资本主义两条道路的问题的全民大辩论。政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命运动，就是彻底地反对资产阶级右派，进一步加强无产阶级在全体人民中的领导权，并且认真克服官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义作风的运动，就是对全体人民进行深刻的社会主义思想教育，系统地批判资产阶级思想，提高广大人民的社会主义觉悟的运动。只有取得政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的胜利，才能扫除我们进行社会主义建设的严重障碍，才能巩固和加强我国的社会主义制度，才能大大推进我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设。正当我国在政治战线上和思想战线上进行社会主义革命运动的时候，我们来学习十月革命的历史意义，分清社会主义革命同资产阶级革命的根本区别，认识社会主义革命的深刻内容，这对于我们批判右派的反动言行，向广大人民进行社会主义思想教育，争取我国社会主义革命在政治战线上、经济战线上和思想战线上的彻底胜利，是有益处的。马克思说过：“这个社会主义就是宣布不停顿革命，就是实现无产阶级阶级专政，作为必经的过渡阶段，以求达到根本消灭阶级差别，消灭这些差别所自出的一切生产关系，消灭一切适应于这些生产关系的社会关系，变革一切由这些社会关系产生出来的观念”?。这也就是说，社会主义革命就是要从政治上、经济上、思想上彻底消灭资产阶级，建立一个没有剥削、没有阶级的社会主义社会。十月社会主义革命是彻底这样做了的，我们也必须彻底地这样做。附注：
