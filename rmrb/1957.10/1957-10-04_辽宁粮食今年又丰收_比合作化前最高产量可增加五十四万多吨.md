Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 2nd: After implementing intensive farming and continuously overcoming natural disasters such as drought, flood, and pests, Liaoning Province's farmers have achieved a second consecutive year of bountiful grain harvest since cooperativization.

According to surveys by the Liaoning Provincial Planning Commission and reports from various counties, the province's total grain output this year can reach 6.7 million tons. Although this is slightly less than the bumper harvest of 1956, it still exceeds the target of the First Five-Year Plan by 430,000 tons; it also represents an increase of more than 540,000 tons compared to 1955, the highest yield in history before cooperativization. In the Tie嶺 Special District, Liaoning Province's main grain-producing area, the total grain output this year exceeded the bumper harvest of 1956 by 4.7%.

Currently, Liaoning Province's autumn grain crops have entered the yellow ripening stage. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions are engaging in extensive debates on grain issues, establishing conventions to increase production and conserve grain, and preparing to harvest, cut, transport, and thresh carefully as the crops ripen, striving to bring every grain home.

    辽宁粮食今年又丰收
    比合作化前最高产量可增加五十四万多吨
    新华社沈阳2日电  辽宁省农民在贯彻精耕细作和连续战胜旱、涝、虫等自然灾害之后，赢得了合作化后第二年粮食丰收。
    根据辽宁省计划委员会测查和各县汇报，全省今年粮食总产量可以达到六百七十万吨，虽然比大丰收的1956年有所减少，但是仍超过第一个五年计划指标四十三万吨；比合作化前的历史上产量最高的1955年增加五十四万多吨。这个省的粮食主要产区铁岭专区，今年粮食总产量超过了大丰收的1956年4.7％。
    现在，辽宁省秋粮作物已经进黄熟期。各地农业社正在结合粮食问题大辩论，订立增产节约粮食的公约，准备随熟、随割、随拉和细收细打，争取颗粒还家。
