Xinhua News Agency, Washington, October 17th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, when discussing the Middle East situation at a press conference on October 16th, expressed support for Turkey's provocative policies towards Syria.

Dulles stated that he "felt somewhat uneasy" about the worldwide accusations that the United States was instigating Turkey to provoke Syria. However, Dulles attempted to create a smokescreen for the U.S. conspiracy, instead saying that "these accusations may be a smokescreen for something even more serious that is about to happen."

Dulles maliciously slandered the Soviet Union regarding the tense situation in the Middle East. He distorted the truth by saying that the Soviet Union had been trying to "threaten" Turkey "by various means" and that the Soviet Union or Syria "might" launch an "attack" on Turkey.

In answering questions from reporters, Dulles emphatically stated that the United States would continue to support Turkey's current foreign policy. He even threatened that if Turkey attacked Syria and the Soviet Union sent troops to stop it, the United States would not make the Soviet Union a "privileged sanctuary." Dulles also said that continuing to implement the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East "is definitely important."

    杜勒斯公开支持土耳其侵叙
    据新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯10月16日在记者招待会上谈到中东局势时表示支持土耳其对叙利亚的挑衅政策。
    杜勒斯表示，他对全世界对美国策动土耳其向叙利亚挑衅的指责“感到有些不安”。但是，杜勒斯企图为美国的阴谋散布烟幕，他反倒说“这些指责可能是将要发生某种更加严重的事情的烟幕”。
    杜勒斯就中东紧张局势恶意地诬蔑苏联。他颠倒黑白地说，苏联一直想“通过各种办法”来“威胁”土耳其，苏联或者叙利亚“有可能”对土耳其发动“进攻”。
    在回答记者的问题时，杜勒斯着重表示，美国将继续支持土耳其目前的外交方针。他甚至扬言，如果土耳其进攻叙利亚而苏联出兵制止的话，美国不会使苏联成为一个“有特权的庇护所”。杜勒斯还说，继续在中东推行“艾森豪威尔主义”“肯定是重要的”。
