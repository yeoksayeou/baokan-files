Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th: The hull of the world's first non-military nuclear icebreaker, the "Lenin," which is equipped with a nuclear engine, has been completely welded. Workers at the Leningrad Shipyard are overhauling the interior of the icebreaker, and are working intensely in preparation for its launch. Assembly workers are installing machinery, generators, and other equipment on the base.

This icebreaker is the largest in the world, with a total engine power of 44,000 horsepower, which is twice the power of the latest American icebreaker, the "Glacier." It is 134 meters long, 27.6 meters wide at its widest point, and has a displacement of 16,000 tons. Its main advantage is that it can sail for 400 days without calling at a port, while coal-powered icebreakers can only sail for 20 days, and diesel-powered icebreakers can only sail for 40 days. It is the best tool for polar navigation, without the risk of being frozen in the ice due to fuel shortages en route. (Attached picture)

　　“列宁号”原子破冰船
    安装机器准备下水
    新华社莫斯科18日电世界上第一艘装有原子发动机的“列宁号”非军用原子破冰船船身已经焊接完毕。列宁格勒造船厂的职工们正在修整破冰船的内部，紧张地进行下水的准备工作，装配工人正在往底座上安装机器、发电机和其他机械。
    这艘破冰船是世界上最大的一艘破冰船，其发动机总功率为四万四千匹马力，比目前美国最新的破冰船“冰河号”的功率要大一倍。它的长度达到一百三十四公尺，最宽处有二十七点六公尺，排水量为一万六千吨。它最主要的优点就是可以不靠港航行四百天之久，而用煤的破冰船只能航行二十天，用柴油的破冰船只能航行四十天。它是极地航行最好的工具，没有中途燃料断绝而被冻在冰中的危险。（附图片）
