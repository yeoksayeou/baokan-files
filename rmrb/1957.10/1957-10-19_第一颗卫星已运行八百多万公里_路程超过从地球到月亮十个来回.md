Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 18th: The Soviet artificial satellite, which has caused a worldwide sensation, has brought new fantasies to a farmer in the remote village of Sarapdad, near Rajkot, in the Bombay State.

According to a report in the Bombay "Free Press" on October 11th, after hearing the news about the artificial satellite, this Indian farmer wrote a registered letter to Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, requesting that he use the Soviet artificial satellite to convey his greetings to an Indian elephant that he believed had been revolving in space since before the Common Era.

In his letter, he said that India launched a space satellite in the era of the famous epic "Mahabharata" before the Common Era. His basis is a legend narrated in the two epics: Kunmo, the second of the five sons of Pandu, once threw an elephant into space. He believed that this elephant is still revolving in space.

The news said that the Indian farmer also asked Khrushchev to be careful in space with the newly launched Soviet artificial satellite so as not to collide with the Indian elephant.

　　第一颗卫星已运行八百多万公里
    路程超过从地球到月亮十个来回
    新华社新德里18日电  轰动全世界的苏联人造卫星，给遥远偏僻的孟买邦拉吉科特附近的萨拉普达德村的一个农民带来了新的幻想。
    据孟买“自由新闻”10月11日报道，这个印度农民在听到人造卫星的消息以后，就写了一封挂号信给苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫，要求通过苏联的人造卫星，向他相信纪元前就在太空中旋转的一只印度象转达他的问候。
    他在这封信中说，印度在纪元前著名史诗“摩呵婆罗多”时代，就曾经发射了一颗太空卫星。他的根据就是两部史诗中叙述的一个传说：班度的五个儿子中的第二个儿子昆摩曾经把一只象抛入太空。他相信，这只象现在仍然在太空中旋转着。
    消息说，因此这个印度农民还要求赫鲁晓夫使新发射的苏联人造卫星在太空中要小心点，不要撞上那只印度象。
