The socialist education movement in the Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, in mid-August, shifted from a period of "great blooming and contending" to a stage of great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism. More than sixty debate meetings have been held in the nine production brigades. Some debate meetings were successful, such as the fourth production brigade's discussion of the superiority of cooperativization, and the fifth production brigade's discussion of the unified purchase and sale of vegetables. Positive and negative opinions were freely debated at the meetings. In the end, the positive opinions refuted the negative opinions with reason and evidence, and the debates gave the peasants a profound socialist education. The experience of this cooperative in conducting great debates proves that the work team must pay attention to the following four issues.

    It is necessary to live with the peasants.

    Work team comrades should live with the peasants, deeply understand the peasants' ideological situation, and not be bound by reports, sorting materials, and statistics. It is necessary to work with the peasants, because sometimes problems that cannot be understood in meetings can be understood in labor. Some peasants are not used to talking at meetings, and more heartfelt words can be heard by contacting them in the fields and on the kang (heated brick bed). When the work team comrades grasp the overall ideological situation of the peasants, it is easier to inspire and guide them to conduct debates. During the transition to the great debate, the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative work team successively issued more than ten kinds of survey forms, including "Classification and Comprehensive Table of Blooming and Contending Issues," "Table of Participation in Meetings," "Comprehensive Analysis Report of Attendance and Speech in Debate Meetings," etc. Some of these forms were unnecessary and could be streamlined. The work team comrades in each production team had to spend several days completing these survey forms, which would inevitably affect the work of mobilizing the masses to carry out great debates. At present, only the seventh production brigade work team has completed the statistical work of all the forms. However, because they focused their main energy on sorting materials and statistics, they neglected the work of mobilizing the masses. After entering the stage of great debate, they did not hold a meeting for more than seven days. Although they held two debate meetings later, they did not really debate. Obviously, their work was slower than other teams. The fifth production brigade work team focused its main efforts on mobilizing the masses. In addition to using various meeting forms to inspire the masses to conduct debates, they also went to the fields to work with the peasants during the day. Sometimes, during breaks in the fields, they held informal small debate meetings. Some women who were embarrassed to speak at large meetings also spoke their minds freely. Some of the masses also offered ideas and suggestions to help the work team comrades study and prepare for the next debate meeting.

    Let the peasants come up with the topics themselves.

    There are two ways to come up with topics for debate: one is for the work team to come up with topics for the masses to discuss, and the other is to let the masses come up with the topics themselves. The Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative work team first discussed with the activists which issues should be debated and how to debate them. After discussion, the activists would raise the issues they considered the most prominent. The order in which they arranged the issues might be different from what the work team originally thought, but the issues they put at the front were the ones they felt were important or well thought out and confident about, so it was easier to use positive opinions to refute negative opinions in the debate. At one meeting of the fifth production brigade, the work team originally planned to discuss the issue of unified purchase and sale of vegetables, but from the beginning of the meeting, the masses spontaneously discussed the issue of whether it was good to keep more private plots. Positive and negative opinions were debated for a long time at the meeting, and finally the capitalist ideas of some wealthy middle peasants who kept more private plots were thoroughly criticized. After the meeting, they studied what was going on. It turned out that a wealthy middle peasant squad leader, with the connivance of the brigade leader, had repeatedly seized the team's land, and recently took a cornfield for himself. The masses had long felt resentment towards his behavior of undermining public interests, and had been fully brewing in private. In fact, the masses had already spontaneously prepared in advance to reason with him when the opportunity arose. If the work team could have taken the initiative to prepare more for this debate meeting, it would have been better. Later, before each debate meeting, the work team discussed the debate topics with the activists, and then told the masses about the issues, and the party members, league members, and activists went to hold some kang-head meetings and field-head meetings to encourage people with different opinions to speak at the meetings, so that the masses were talking about it before the meeting, and after full deliberation, each meeting was better than the previous one, and the people who attended were also very enthusiastic.

    The work team cannot do everything for them.

    The city and district work teams sent to the countryside are to assist the agricultural cooperative party organization in carrying out the socialist education movement. Therefore, in the work, it is necessary to pay attention to preventing doing everything for them, and to pay attention to cultivating the democratic style of local cadres and establishing their prestige among the masses. After the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative work team went to the countryside, they mobilized the masses to carry out great blooming and contending, and at the same time implemented the spirit of correcting while rectifying, and timely handled some of the issues raised by the masses. The masses generally feel that the work team has really solved the problem this time, but some people also think about what to do after the work team leaves? Can the local cadres continue to do it? People with this concern are not very happy to speak at the blooming and contending forums or debate meetings. Later, some production team meetings were changed to be presided over by branch secretaries and production team leaders, and they also made explanations at the meetings on how the problems raised by the masses were solved. In this way, when solving problems, the work team and the local cadres jointly discussed the solutions, and the local cadres made explanations to the masses, gradually changing the masses' views, and believing that the branch secretaries and production team leaders could really solve the problems, and the masses' enthusiasm for participating in the movement became even higher. The local cadres do have more favorable conditions than the work team comrades, such as they are familiar with the local situation, which is convenient for linking with reality, and their speeches are also very popular and vivid, and the masses can easily accept them.

    Cultivate activists.

    Cultivating activists is the key to holding good debate meetings. Generally, young people have fewer worries and higher enthusiasm. At the beginning of the movement, we must rely on these people to open up the situation. For example, there were several Communist Youth League members in the fifth production brigade who had always opposed the bureaucratic style of leadership and bad behaviors such as undermining the unified purchase and sale of vegetables. They stood firm in the debate meetings, were willing to take the lead in speaking, and were sharp. After they sparked the discussion, everyone debated, so we must pay attention to educating and cultivating these young activists so that they can play a leading role. There are also some activists who do not show up at the beginning of the movement. They are mostly experienced old peasants with high prestige among the masses. Their attitude in the great debate has a great impact on the masses. But when the movement goes deeper, it is these people who really decide the issue. When the fifth production brigade criticized a wealthy middle peasant squad leader for occupying the team's land, the old farmer Yang Fang, who usually did not like to talk, spoke. That squad leader had seized the team's cornfield in front of him. He exposed the facts, had reasons and evidence, and sternly criticized the squad leader's selfish behavior and criticized the brigade leader who condoned him. While listening to him, the masses nodded repeatedly, saying that he should be criticized. In the face of the ironclad facts, the squad leader could not deny it and had to bow his head to the masses and admit his guilt. The work team should pay special attention to discovering and cultivating such activists. Because the fifth production brigade cultivated a group of activists, the great debate gradually deepened, and in the debate, the majority of the peasants were united around the party, forming a large army to protect the interests of the agricultural cooperative and defend socialism.

    北京星火农业社在社会主义教育运动中
    工作组注意发动群众取得成绩
    本报讯　北京市东郊区星火农业生产合作社的社会主义教育运动，在8月中旬，由大鸣大放转入社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论阶段。在九个生产大队中已经举行了六十多次辩论会。有的辩论会开得好，如第四生产大队讨论的合作化优越性问题，第五生产大队讨论的蔬菜统购包销问题，正反面两种意见在会上展开了自由争辩，最后正面意见有理有据地驳倒了反面意见，通过辩论使农民们受到一次深刻的社会主义教育。这个社进行大辩论的经验证明工作组必须注意下面四个问题。
    要和农民生活在一起
    工作组同志要和农民生活在一起，深入地了解农民的思想情况，不要让汇报、整理材料、统计数字束缚住。要和农民一起劳动，因为有时候在会议上了解不到的问题，在劳动中可以了解到。有的农民不惯于在会上谈话，在地头上、炕头上和他们接触中，可以听到更多人的心里话。工作组同志掌握了农民的全面思想情况，就便于启发、诱导他们进行辩论。星火农业社工作组在转向大辩论期间，曾连续发下十多种调查表格，有“鸣放问题分类综合表”、“参加会议情况表”、“辩论会出席发言情况综合分析报告表”等等，这些表格有些是不必要的，可以精简掉。各生产队工作组同志为完成这些调查表格，要用去几天的时间，必然会影响发动群众开展大辩论的工作。目前，只有第七生产大队工作组完成全部表格的统计工作。可是他们由于把主要精力陷在整理材料和统计工作中，忽略了发动群众的工作，在转入大辩论阶段以后，七天多没有开过一次会，后来虽然开了两次辩论会，但是并没有辩论起来，显然他们工作开展得就比其它组迟缓。第五生产大队工作组把主要力量用在发动群众工作上，除了用各种会议形式启发群众进行辩论，还在日间和农民一同下地劳动。有时候就在地头上利用休息时间，不拘形式的开起小辩论会。一些在大会上不好意思发言的妇女，也都畅所欲言的说出心里话。有的群众还出主意、提意见，帮助工作组同志研究、准备下一次辩论会。
    让农民自己出题目
    出题目辩论有两种方法：一种是由工作组出题目交群众讨论，一种是让群众自己出题目。星火农业社工作组对于哪些问题该辩论，如何辩论，都先跟积极分子商量。经过商量，积极分子会把他们认为最突出的问题提出来。他们排列问题的次序可能和工作组原来想的不一样，可是他们放在前面的问题，是他们感到重要的或考虑成熟的、有把握的问题，在辩论中也就比较容易地用正面意见驳倒反面意见。第五生产大队有一次会议，工作组原准备在会上讨论蔬菜统购包销问题，可是群众从会议开始便自发地讨论起多留自留地好不好的问题，会上正反面意见争执许久，最后把一些多留自留地的富裕中农的资本主义思想批判得体无完肤。会后研究这是怎么回事呢？原来有一个富裕中农小队长，在大队长纵容下，一再强占社里的地，最近又把一块玉米地收为己有。群众对他这种破坏公共利益的行为早就感到愤恨，私下酝酿得很充分，实际上就是群众在下面早就自发地作好准备，俟机同他评评理。这次辩论会如果工作组能够主动地再作些准备，必定会开得更好。以后，工作组在每次辩论会前都和积极分子一起商量辩论题目，然后把问题告诉群众，并且由党团员、积极分子去开一些炕头会、地头会，鼓动有不同意见的人在会上讲话，使群众在会前就议论纷纷，经过充分酝酿，以后一次会比一次会开得好，到会的人也非常踊跃。
    工作组不能包办代替
    市、区派下乡的工作组，是协助农业社党组织进行社会主义教育运动的，因此在工作中要时常注意防止包办代替，要注意培养本地干部民主作风，和树立他们在群众中的威信。星火农业社工作组下乡以后，发动群众进行大鸣大放，同时贯彻边整边改的精神，及时处理了群众提出的一些问题。群众目前普遍感到工作组这次下乡真解决问题，但是也有人想到将来工作组走以后怎么办？本地干部能不能继续做下去？产生这种顾虑的人，在鸣放座谈会上或辩论会上发言就不十分爽快。后来有些生产队的会议，改由分支书记、生产队长主持，群众提出的问题如何解决的，也由他们在会上做交代。这样，解决问题时是工作组和本地干部共同商量办法，并由本地干部向群众作交代，逐渐改变了群众的看法，认为支部书记、生产队长真能解决问题，群众参加运动的情绪便更加高涨。本地干部也确实比工作组同志具备更多有利的条件，比如他们对本地情况熟悉，便于联系实际，他们讲话又很通俗、生动，群众容易接受。
    培养积极分子
    培养积极分子是开好辩论会的关键问题。一般青年人顾虑少，热情高，运动开始的时候非依靠这些人打开局面不可。例如第五生产大队有几个共青团员，过去一向反对领导上的官僚作风，反对破坏蔬菜统购包销等坏行为。他们在辩论会上立场站得稳，肯带头发言，而且尖锐。经过他们给接火，大家就辩论起来，因此对这部分青年积极分子，必须注意教育和培养，使他们发挥带头作用。也有一些积极分子不是运动一开始就显出来的，他们多是富有生产经验在群众中威信又较高的老农民，他们在大辩论中的态度对群众有很大影响。但是当运动深入，真正决定问题的是这些人。第五生产大队在批评一个富裕中农小队长多占社里地的时候，平时不爱讲话的老农杨方发了言，那个小队长就是当着他面强占去社的玉米地。他揭露事实，有理有据，义正词严地批驳了那个小队长自私自利行为，批评了纵容他的大队长。群众一面听他讲话，一面连连点头，都说该批评，那个小队长在铁的事实面前，无法进行抵赖，不能不向群众低头认罪。对这样的积极分子，工作组尤其要注意发现和培养。第五生产大队由于培养了一批积极分子，才使大辩论逐步深入，并且在辩论中把大多数农民团结在党的周围，形成一支保护农业社利益、保卫社会主义的大军。
