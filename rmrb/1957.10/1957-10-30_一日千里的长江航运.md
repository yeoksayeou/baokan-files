    The Rapid Development of Yangtze River Shipping
    Xu Ben
    The Yangtze River, China's largest river and a world-renowned waterway, is becoming busier day by day. Thousands of ships, large and small, shuttle back and forth around the clock. In many important ports, the roar of loading and unloading machinery intertwines with the sharp blasts of ship horns from overseas vessels. The vigorous development of Yangtze River shipping has brought prosperity and happiness to thousands of towns and two hundred million residents along the Yangtze River basin. In recent years, the state has invested huge sums of money in the Yangtze River shipping industry. Now, the shipping landscape of the Yangtze River, which contains enormous natural wealth, has been greatly changed.
    When you take a boat upstream from Shanghai, you will find that Yangtze River shipping is no longer what it used to be. Older people still remember that the Yangtze River was once a "fat piece of meat" for imperialism. British companies like "Jardine Matheson" and "Butterfield & Swire," and the Japanese "Nissin" shipping company, were arrogant and domineering, manipulating the shipping rights of the Yangtze River. The Kuomintang's "China Merchants Steam Navigation Company," despite engaging in shipping for decades, made no achievements in Yangtze River shipping, except for acquiring some wooden-hulled ships from Japan, some oil engines from American landing craft, and some pontoons from Britain. There was also no planning for ship transport; they went wherever there was profit. Hundreds of large and small shipping companies were scattered throughout the Yangtze River ports, competing with each other, forming an extremely chaotic and fragmented situation. Now this situation has fundamentally changed.
    In the dispatch room of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau, the reporter saw the entire transportation situation of the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The dispatchers here work around the clock, and they know the daily transportation on the river and port operations like the back of their hand through several ship actual operation charts. The dispatch telephone, established in 1954, directs all ports along the line at any time. Xu Qingyi, director of the General Dispatch Office, told me that such unified dispatch and unified command did not exist before liberation. In recent years, the transportation on the Yangtze River has become busier year by year. Last year, the entire Yangtze River's transportation task increased by nearly seven times compared with 1950. In five years, the number of passengers transported on the entire Yangtze River is equivalent to an average of one in every seventeen people in the country taking a boat on the Yangtze River once. The cargo transport task is even more enormous. Tens of millions of tons of construction materials and daily necessities are transported to various places on both sides of the river day and night. The Yangtze River shipping department has successfully supported the people on both sides of the river in overcoming the flood struggle, and has also transported a large number of heavy machinery and equipment to support huge construction projects such as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. In the past five years alone, more than 6 million tons of grain have been transported from Sichuan, which can feed 32 million people for a year.
    In order to adapt to this ever-increasing transport task, the number of ships operating on the Yangtze River has been increasing in recent years. It is estimated that in the five years up to this year, 422 new and rebuilt ships will be added, increasing transport capacity by nearly 280,000 deadweight tons. Special and semi-special ships are also becoming more and more numerous. They include pig barges, oil tanker barges, refrigerated barges, and ore barges with various special equipment and devices. Most of these new types of barges are designed and manufactured in our country. A batch of passenger and cargo ships are also under construction and reconstruction. Next year, there will be larger passenger and cargo ships than the current "Jiangxin" ship operating in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The new passenger and cargo ships added to the Sichuan River will have entirely new equipment such as laundry rooms with electric washing machines, ironing rooms with steam ironing machines, wards, and baby bathrooms, allowing passengers to spend their trips more comfortably.
    In the past, night navigation was impossible on the more than 2,000-kilometer航线 of the Yangtze River throughout the year. The biggest threats to navigation were the scattered reefs and narrow, winding channels. In recent years, more than a dozen harnessing engineering teams, blasting teams, dredging teams, and surveying teams dispatched by the state have launched a struggle against nature in the dangerous waterway of Madang between Anqing and Jiujiang, the Tianxingzhou waterway in the middle reaches where the riverbed changes drastically, and the reef-strewn Sichuan River. In these places, people have cleared four to five million cubic meters of silt and reefs. The old navigational marks, which were few in number and incomplete and chaotic, have been eliminated. Nearly 7,000 new-style navigational marks were set up by the end of last year. Red and white signs are arranged on the left and right banks along the entire line, less than one kilometer apart. At night, the light beacons are like sparkling pearls, guiding ships to move forward safely. Now, not only is night navigation possible in the middle and lower reaches, but also in the Sichuan River, which was once considered "three parts danger for ship navigation," day and night navigation is also possible. In this way, the ship turnover rate has greatly improved. Before 1954, it took five days for an upstream ship from Yichang to Chongqing; after 1955, it only took three days to arrive. Downstream ships have also generally shortened by one to two days.
    The backwardness and chaos of Yangtze River ports in the past have also gradually changed.
    The reporter visited Hankou Port. This is the center of Yangtze River shipping. Workers who used to rely on two ropes and a carrying pole for loading and unloading are now gradually learning the operation of mechanical loading and unloading. In the six wharves and many warehouses along the river, dozens of meters of belt conveyors and chain conveyors are constantly transporting goods; battery transport vehicles loaded with goods hum and move quickly back and forth between the wharves and warehouses one after another. At night, the port is brightly lit, and the rhythmic sound of loading and unloading machinery echoes through the night sky, gradually replacing the shouts of the dockworkers in the past.
    This is not an isolated phenomenon in individual ports. In many ports such as Yichang, Huangshi, and Nanjing, dozens of types of loading and unloading machinery such as cranes, crane ships, rail-mounted cranes, cable cars, and various transport machines, handling vehicles, and loading and unloading vehicles have been added one after another. A large number of steel rails and heavy machinery supporting the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway were loaded and unloaded at Jiulongpo, Chongqing, using a complete set of mechanical equipment. Now, a fully mechanized loading and unloading wharf is being built at Yuxikou Port, opposite Wuhu. In the future, a large amount of raw coal from the Huainan Coal Mine will be transported to all parts of the country through this new type of port. Expansion projects are also underway in other ports such as Chongqing and Hankou.
    The construction of Yangtze River shipping is now only a new beginning, but this beginning is already advancing at a rapid pace.

    一日千里的长江航运
    徐奔
    世界闻名的我国第一大河——长江，一天天地繁忙了。数以千计的大小船舶日夜穿梭来往；在许多重要港口，装卸机械的轰鸣与港外轮船汽笛的尖叫交织成一片。长江航运的蓬勃发展，给长江流域两岸数千座城镇和两亿居民带来了繁荣和幸福。这几年，国家给长江航运事业投下了巨额资金。现在，这个蕴藏着巨大天然财富的长江的航运面貌已经大大地改观了。
    当你从上海搭轮溯江而上，你会发现长江航运已经是今非昔比。年纪稍大的人都还记得：长江曾是帝国主义的一块“肥肉”。英国的“怡和”、“太古”和日本的“日清”等轮船公司都曾飞扬跋扈，操纵长江的航运权。国民党的“招商局”虽说搞了几十年的航运，但是除了从日本搞点木壳船、从美国登陆艇上搞点油机、从英国弄点趸船以外，对长江航运毫无建树。船舶运输也没有计划，哪里有利就到哪里去。上百家大小轮船公司遍布长江各个港口，相互竞争，形成四分五裂的极端混乱、分散的局面。现在这种局面已经根本改变了。
    记者在长江航运管理局的调度室里看到了整个长江上、中、下游运输的景象。这里的调度人员通宵工作，通过几张船舶实际运行图对每天江上运输和港口作业了如指掌；1954年建立的调度电话，随时指挥着全线各个港口。总调度室主任许庆仪对我说：这样的统一调度和统一指挥解放前是没有的。这几年，长江的运输一年比一年繁忙。去年全长江的运输任务比1950年增加了将近七倍。五年里全长江运送旅客的人数，等于在全国每十七个人中，平均有一人在长江乘坐轮船航行一次。货运的任务更为巨大。千万吨的建设器材和生活用品昼夜不停地运送到两岸各地。长江航运部门曾经胜利地支援过两岸人民战胜洪水的斗争，也曾大量地运送重型机具和器材支援像成渝铁路、荆江分洪的巨大的建设工程。最近五年，仅从四川运出的粮食就达六百多万吨，这些粮食可供三千二百万人吃一年。
    为了适应这种不断高涨的运输任务，行驶长江的船舶这几年不断增加。预计到今年为止的五年间，新建和改建的船舶将达四百二十二艘，增加运输能力约近二十八万载重吨。特种船和半特种船也越来越多了。它们包括有各种特种设备和装置的装猪驳、油罐驳；冷藏驳和矿砂驳等。这些新型的驳船大半都是我国设计制造的。一批客货轮目前也正在新建和改建。明年将有比目前“江新”轮更大的客货轮在长江下游行驶，在川江新增加的客货轮中，将拥有电动洗衣机的洗衣室、蒸汽烫衣机的烫衣室及病房、婴儿浴室等全新设备，旅客们将更加舒适地度过旅行生活。
    过去，在长江两千多公里航线上，全年不能夜航。对航行威胁最大的是那些星罗棋布的礁石和狭窄弯线的航道。这几年，国家派出的十多个整治工程队、爆炸队、挖泥船队和测量队，在安庆——九江之间的马当危险水道、中游河床变化剧烈的天星洲水道和礁石密布的川江，向自然开展了斗争。在这些地方，人们清除了四五百万方的泥沙和礁石。以前为数少的可怜而又残缺混乱的旧航标也被革除了，近七千座新式航标已在去年底设置起来，在全线沿江相距不到一公里的地方，红白色的标志分列在左右两岸，一到夜晚，灯标像点点明珠，指引着船舶安全前进。现在不仅在中、下游全部夜航，而且在过去被认为“行船走水三分险”的川江也能昼夜行船。这样，船舶周转率大为提高。1954年以前，宜昌往重庆的上水船需要五天，1955年以后，只要三天就可以到达；下水轮船也普遍地缩短了一天到两天。
    过去长江港口的落后和混乱状态也逐渐改变了。
    记者参观了汉口港。这里是长江航运的中心。过去靠两根绳子、一根扁担进行装卸工作的工人，现在已渐渐学会了机械装卸的操作。在沿江六个码头和许多仓库，几十公尺长的皮带式输送机和链板式输送机不停地运送货物；满载货物的蓄电池搬运车嗡嗡地发出声响，一个接一个地轻捷地来往于码头和仓库之间。入夜，港口灯火通明，装卸机械的节奏声响彻夜空，过去码头工人的一片号子声已经渐渐被它所代替。
    这不是个别港口的现象。在宜昌、黄石和南京等许多港口，都陆续新增了起重机、起重船、轨行吊车、缆车和各种运输机、搬运车、装卸车等几十种装卸机械。支援成渝铁路的大批钢轨和重型机械就是用整套机械设备在重庆九龙坡装卸的。现在，在芜湖对岸的裕溪口港正在建设一座全部机械化的装卸码头，将来淮南煤矿大量的原煤，就通过这个新型的港口运送到全国各地。在重庆、汉口等其他港口，扩建工程也正在进行。
    长江航运的建设现在才是一个新的开端，但是这个开端已经是以一日千里的速度前进。
