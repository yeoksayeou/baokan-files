    The Flame of Enthusiasm for the Party
    Sha Ou
    Walking through the workshops and office buildings,
    That flame of enthusiasm stirs me,
    Thousands of big-character posters
    Cover the walls and corridors,
    Like streets of red and green flowers.
    I hear ten thousand hearts beating,
    Beating for the new high tide of construction.
    My brothers,
    They are by the blast furnace,
    In the shimmering starlight,
    Drawing forth the surging molten iron.
    They are by the coke ovens,
    In the tumultuous, fog-like steam,
    Loading the gray coke into wagons.
    How diligent, how proud they are,
    All wanting to do better, move faster,
    Leaving time far behind.
    They have just finished their shift,
    And put earth-like, pure language,
    Diamond-like, strong language,
    Confidently written on big-character posters.
    Loyal hearts for the Party,
    For the cause of the class,
    Using the whip to lash fiercely
    At the shortcomings and errors in their work.
    This roaring sound,
    Like a torrential downpour,
    Washes our factory,
    As we have long awaited.
    The Party committee office stays up all night,
    Sorting out and studying
    These jewel-like, radiant
    Tens of thousands of opinions.
    The great determination is the will of the Party,
    What can be corrected is being corrected.
    A warm current nourishes the hearts of ten thousand,
    The flame of enthusiasm illuminates
    The broad road leading directly to Communism.
    I feel so invigorated and happy.

    火焰的热情为了党
    沙鸥
    走过车间和办公大楼
    那火焰的热情使我激动
    千百张大字报
    贴满了墙壁和过道
    像红红绿绿的花街
    我听见一万颗心在跳动
    为建设的新高潮而跳动
    我的兄弟
    他们在高炉旁
    在金星闪灼中
    引出了浩荡的铁水
    他们在炼焦炉边
    在喧腾的大雾一样的水气里
    把灰色的焦炭装进车皮
    他们多么勤劳、多么自豪
    都想作得更好、走得更快
    让时间远远掉在后面
    他们刚刚交班
    就把泥土一样纯朴的语言
    钻石一样坚强的语言
    满怀信心地写在大字报上
    忠诚的心为了党
    为了阶级的事业
    用鞭子狠狠地抽着
    工作中的缺点和错误
    这轰鸣着的音响
    像一场倾盆的急雨
    洗着我们的工厂
    如久久期待的那样
    党委办公室彻夜不眠
    清理着、研究着
    这如珠宝一样光芒四射
    成千上万的意见
    巨大的决心是党的意志
    能改正的都着手改了
    暖流滋润着万人的心胸
    热情的火焰照亮了
    直通共产主义的大路
    我感到多么振奋和幸福
