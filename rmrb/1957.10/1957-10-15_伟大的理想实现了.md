　　The Great Ideal is Realized

    The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge officially opens to traffic today, and the ideal of the Chinese people for many centuries has become a reality. This is another great achievement of China's socialist construction in its leap forward. It fully demonstrates the great superiority of the socialist system. This bridge is the crystallization of the labor and wisdom of the Chinese people, and also the crystallization of the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Soviet experts have made arduous efforts in the construction of this bridge. Today, on the first day of the official opening of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, we express our respect to all workers, engineering and technical personnel, management cadres, and all those who have supported the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge with their labor! We extend our deep respect to the Soviet experts who have painstakingly helped build the bridge!

    The Yangtze River has been known as a "natural barrier" since ancient times. The river is wide and deep, and the wind rises and waves surge. "White waves are like mountains that cannot be crossed, and the strong winds worry the sailors on the steep sails." "Rocks collapse from the clouds, and the startling waves break the shore, rolling up a thousand piles of snow." This is how ancient poets described the waves of the Yangtze River. However, today, on this turbulent Yangtze River, trains are speeding by, and the dangers of nature have succumbed to the will and power of the people. Wuchang and Hankou face each other across the river, and in the past, they could only rely on wooden boats and ferries to transport goods and passengers from north to south. The carrying capacity of wooden boats and ferries was limited, and it took more time to load and unload goods. In addition, the maximum wind force in this area reaches level seven to nine every year, and there are two to three hundred cloudy days in a year. When strong winds rage and thick fog obscures the sun, wooden boats and ferries are suspended, and north-south traffic is often forced to be interrupted. After liberation, with the development of the national economy, the transportation tasks across the Yangtze River, especially at the Wuhan ferry, increased day by day. In 1956, the railway ferries here carried more than 6 million tons of goods back and forth, an increase of more than 2 million tons compared with 1953. When the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise is completed in the future, the transportation volume will increase greatly. If there is no modern bridge to connect the north and south of the river, it will obviously not be able to meet the needs of national construction and people's lives. The completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge connects the Jinghan Railway, which is 1,216 kilometers long, and the Yuehan Railway, which is 1,103 kilometers long, into one. It connects the original Xianggui Railway, Zhegan Railway, the newly built Yingxia Railway, Lai'mu Railway, and the under-construction Qiangui Railway, Sichuan-Guizhou Railway and other southern railway trunk lines with the northern railway trunk lines, making transportation between the north and south of the river unimpeded from now on. This is obviously of great significance for the exchange of goods throughout the country and for the construction of industrial bases in the Wuhan area.

    The Chinese people have long hoped to build bridges over the Yangtze River. From 1913 until before liberation, Chinese engineering and technical personnel had conducted four surveys and designs for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. However, the reactionary rulers at that time did not want to, and could not, carry out such a huge and complex construction project. Decades have passed, and there is not even a shadow of a bridge. Folk songs say: "The Yellow River cannot be tamed; the Yangtze River Bridge cannot be built." In the old society, people no longer dared to have any hope of building the Yangtze River Bridge. After liberation, the entire Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction project, including the main bridge and approach bridges of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Hanshui Railway Bridge, the Jianghan Bridge, ten urban overpass bridges, and 17.4 kilometers of connecting lines, was completed in just over three years. What is the reason for this? Could it be that the Yangtze River is particularly kind to the new China, and it has suddenly become a river that is not difficult to bridge? Of course not. The Yangtze River is still the Yangtze River, with deep water, rapid flow, complex geological conditions, and extremely unstable sand layers in the riverbed, making bridging very difficult. We also have no heavenly soldiers or generals. Almost half of the senior and middle-level engineering and technical personnel who built the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge were from the China Bridge Company before liberation. They have long been determined to build the Yangtze River Bridge, and they can finally show their skills when their hair turns white. So, what exactly is the reason why the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which had been clamoring for decades before liberation, finally became a bubble, but was built in a short period of time after liberation? The only reason is that our society is a socialist society, which has unparalleled superiority over any social system in history. It gives us the power to overcome difficulties and create miracles.

    Socialist society is a society where the majority of people are masters of their own affairs. In this society, everything that is beneficial to the country and the people is implemented one by one. This is fundamentally impossible in a class society where a minority oppresses the majority. At that time, despite the enthusiastic efforts of many engineering and technical personnel, who launched a moving advertisement of "Long Rainbow Lying on the Waves" and used the amount of income that could be generated each year after completion as bait to attract patrons who were willing to invest, neither the reactionary government at that time nor the wealthy financial tycoons were indifferent to the rise and fall of the country and the life and death of the people. How could they preside over the construction project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which was costly, time-consuming, and laborious? Only socialist society can realize the ideals of the people; and only socialist society can organize the cooperation of various relevant departments and mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of thousands of people to quickly complete such a large-scale project. Taking the coordination required for the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge as an example, from surveying and designing, manufacturing steel beams, to formal construction, each item is a large-scale organizational work, requiring close cooperation between various departments. In capitalist society, this is an extremely difficult thing. The only way is to lure with heavy profits. This capitalist method not only wastes funds, but also wastes time, and things cannot be done. A completely new situation has emerged in socialist society: there are people everywhere and things everywhere. Just in terms of accepting processing orders, more than 40 factories across the country have made great efforts, and the progress of the project has never been affected by poor coordination between departments. Imagine, without the powerful power of the socialist system, how could there be such a rapid bridge construction speed!

    The completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge also shows that China's industry has developed and its scientific and technological level has improved. In history, China has never built a modern large-scale bridge with its own manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Taking steel beams as an example, the Luokou Yellow River Bridge was built by the German Meng'an Company, the Zhakou Qiantang River Bridge was built by the British Daomenlang Company, but the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built by our own factory in China. Without the first five-year plan with the development of heavy industry as the center, and without the development of the metallurgical industry and the machinery industry, it would be impossible to use our own steel beams to build bridges. Building bridges over the Yangtze River is a world engineering problem. When we decided to build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, some newspapers in capitalist countries ridiculed us for being "adventurous." They do not understand that in the face of the Chinese people who are building socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party, there are no insurmountable difficulties. The improvement of scientific and technological level takes time, but it is by no means unattainable. We have built a bridge over the Yangtze River, proving that our scientific and technological level in bridge construction has been greatly improved, and in some aspects is not as good as that of capitalist countries. For example, we use the pipe column drilling method to build deep-water foundations, which is not available in capitalist countries. Some rightists say that "the Communist Party cannot lead science and technology." In the face of such powerful facts, what other way do they have but to admit their complete bankruptcy?

    We would also like to especially mention the great assistance given to us by the Soviet government and the Soviet people. Without the comprehensive help of the Soviet government, without the tireless guidance of more than 20 Soviet experts who went to the site in person, and especially without the pipe column drilling method proposed by Soviet experts, the bridge could not have been built so quickly, so well, and so economically. Soviet assistance enabled us to complete the original plan greatly ahead of schedule, greatly saved manpower, material resources and financial resources, and enabled us to learn the world's unprecedented new bridge construction technology. The great project across the river will always be the common pride of the workers of China and the Soviet Union, and will always be a monument to the friendly cooperation of 800 million people. The opening of the bridge on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution is the most vivid lesson in the internationalist education of our people. We must unswervingly learn from the Soviet Union, and we must constantly consolidate and strengthen the friendship between the people of the two countries.

　　伟大的理想实现了
    武汉长江大桥今天正式通车了，我国人民许多世纪以来的理想变成了现实。这是我国社会主义建设在跃进中的又一伟大的成就。它充分证明了社会主义制度的巨大优越性。这座大桥是我国人民劳动和智慧的结晶，也是中苏两国伟大友谊的结晶。苏联的专家们在这座大桥的建设过程中曾经付出了艰巨的劳动。今天，当武汉长江大桥正式通车的第一天，我们向一切参加武汉长江大桥建设的工人、工程技术人员、管理干部和一切以自己的劳动支援武汉长江大桥建设的人们表示敬意！向费尽心血帮助建设大桥的苏联专家致深切的敬意！
    长江自古称为“天堑”。江宽水深，风起浪作。“白浪如山那可渡，狂风愁杀峭帆人。”“乱石崩云，惊涛裂岸，卷起千堆雪。”这就是古代诗人们对于长江波涛的描绘。可是，今天就是在这滔滔的长江面上，飞驰着一列列的火车，自然界的险阻向人民的意志和力量屈服了。武昌汉口隔岸相望，过去只能依靠木船和轮渡来运送南来北往的物资和行人。木船和轮渡的载重能力有限，倒载货物更费时间。加上这一带地区每年最大的风力达到七级至九级，一年中的阴云天气竟有二、三百天，遇到狂风肆威和浓雾蔽日的时候，木船轮渡停航，南北交通往往被迫中断。解放以后，随着国民经济的发展，长江南北，特别是武汉渡口的运输任务与日俱增。1956年从这里的铁路轮渡往返载运的货物就有六百多万吨，比1953年增加了二百多万吨。将来武汉钢铁联合企业建成的时候，运输量还会大量增加。如果没有一座近代化的大桥来沟通大江南北，显然不能满足国家建设和人民生活的需要。武汉长江大桥的建成，使全长一千二百十六公里的京汉铁路和全长一千一百零三公里的粤汉铁路连成一气，使原有的湘桂铁路、浙赣铁路，新建成的鹰厦铁路、来睦铁路和正在建设中的黔桂铁路、川黔铁路等南方铁路干线同北方铁路干线连结起来，使大江南北的运输从此畅通无阻。这对于全国范围内的物资交流，对于武汉地区工业基地的建设，显然具有非常巨大的意义。
    中国人民希望在长江上架设桥梁由来已久。从1913年开始，到解放前为止，中国的工程技术人员曾进行过四次武汉长江大桥的勘测设计工作。可是，当时的反动统治者不想也不可能进行这样巨大复杂的建设，几十年的光阴过去了，那有桥梁的一线影子呢？民谣说：“黄河水，治不好；长江桥，修不了。”旧社会里，人民对于修建长江大桥，已经不敢再有任何希望了。解放以后，包括武汉长江大桥正桥和引桥，汉水铁桥，江汉桥，十座市区跨线桥和十七点四公里联络线路的全部武汉长江大桥建设工程，只用三年多的时间就完成了。这是什么缘故呢？莫非长江对新中国特别宽厚，它忽然变成一条不是难以架桥的河流了？当然不是的。长江还是长江，水深，流急，地质情况复杂，河床的沙层极不稳定，架桥是非常困难的。我们也并无天兵神将，建设武汉长江大桥的高级的和中级的工程技术人员，几乎过半是解放前中国桥梁公司的人员，他们有志于长江大桥久矣，到白了少年头，才得一显身手。那么，究竟是什么缘故，解放前叫嚷了几十年的武汉长江大桥终成泡影，解放后却在短短的时间内建成了呢？唯一的原因，就在我们的社会是社会主义社会，它具有历史上任何社会制度都无法比拟的优越性，它使我们有力量战胜困难，创造奇迹。
    社会主义社会是多数人当家做主的社会，在这个社会中，有利于国家，有利于人民的事情无不逐一付诸实现，这是少数人压迫多数人的阶级社会根本做不到的。那时候，尽管有不少工程技术人员热心奔走，打起“长虹卧波”的动人广告，以建成后每年可以有多少收入为引饵，招徕乐于投资的主顾，但是无论是当时的反动政府，也无论是家财万贯的金融巨头，他们连国家的兴亡、人民的死活都无动于衷，怎肯主持这费钱、费时、费事的武汉长江大桥的建设工程呢？只有社会主义社会，才能实现人民的理想；也只有社会主义社会，才能组织各个有关部门的协作，发动千万群众的积极性和创造性，来迅速完成这样规模巨大的工程。拿建设武汉长江大桥所需要的协作配合来说，从勘测设计、制造钢梁、到正式施工，件件都是规模浩大的组织工作，需要各个部门的密切配合。在资本主义社会里，这是一件极端困难的事情，唯一的办法是诱以重利。这种资本主义的办法耗费资金不说，时间白白地过去了，事情也办不成。社会主义社会出现了一个全新的情况：四海之内，要人有人，要东西有东西，仅接受加工订货一项，全国就有四十多个工厂出过大力，工程进度从没有因为各部门配合不好受到影响。试想如果没有社会主义制度的强大威力，那有这样迅速的建桥速度！
    武汉长江大桥的建成，还说明了我国的工业发展了，科学技术水平提高了。有史以来，中国没有用自己的人力、物力、财力建成过一座近代化的大型桥梁。拿钢梁来说，泺口黄河桥是德国孟阿恩公司造的，闸口钱塘江桥是英国的道门朗公司造的，武汉长江大桥却是我国自己的工厂造的。如果没有以发展重工业为中心的第一个五年计划，没有冶金工业和机械工业的发展，用自己的钢梁来架设桥梁，是不可能的。在长江上架设桥梁，是世界工程上的难题。当我们决定修建武汉长江大桥的时候，有的资本主义国家的报纸讥笑我们是“冒险”。他们不了解，在共产党领导下的正在进行社会主义建设的中国人民的面前，没有不可战胜的困难。科学技术水平的提高虽然需要时日，但是决不是高不可攀的。我们在长江上建成了大桥，证明我们建筑桥梁的科学技术水平已经大大地提高了，并且在某些方面为资本主义国家所不及。例如我们用管柱钻孔法修筑深水基础，就是资本主义国家所没有的。某些右派分子说“共产党不能领导科学技术”，在这样强大的事实面前，他们除了承认自己彻底破产以外，还有什么别的办法呢？
    我们还要特别提到苏联政府和苏联人民给予我们的伟大援助。没有苏联政府的全面帮助，没有二十几位苏联专家不辞辛劳地亲赴现场指导，特别是没有苏联专家提出的管柱钻孔法，大桥是不可能这样快、这样好、这样省地建设成功的。苏联的援助使我们大大提前完成了原定的计划，大大节约了人力物力和财力，并且使我们学会了世界上前所未有的最新的建桥技术。横跨江面的伟大工程，永远是中苏两国劳动者共同的骄傲，永远是八亿人民友好合作的纪念碑。大桥在伟大的十月革命四十周年前夕通车，更是对于我国人民的国际主义教育中最生动的一课。我们必须坚定不移地学习苏联，必须不断地巩固和加强两国人民的友谊。
