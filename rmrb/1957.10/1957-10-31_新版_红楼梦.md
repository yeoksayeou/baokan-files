    New Edition of "Dream of the Red Chamber"
    The newly published edition of "Dream of the Red Chamber" by the People's Literature Publishing House has many distinctive features. In addition to woodcut illustrations and a portrait of the author, the text adopts simplified characters and horizontal typesetting. The annotation work is more precise, and rich collation notes are appended to the end of the text.
    To explain the characteristics of the new edition of "Dream of the Red Chamber," it is probably necessary to look back at the beginning. The Cheng editions from the Qianlong era are extremely rare. The so-called "Cheng Jia Edition" and "Cheng Yi Edition" are very hard to come by. Experts have debated the merits and differences between "Jia" and "Yi." However, until the start of the new edition's collation work, the only very precious "Cheng Jia Edition" that could be borrowed was still quite incomplete; there was no complete book. All the editions circulated in the market in the past were repeatedly re-engraved from the Wang edition of the Daoguang period, with errors accumulating over hundreds of years. The Yadong edition, which Hu Shi and others greatly promoted, was carelessly collated and completely unreliable. As for the errors and debatable points in punctuation and paragraphing, they were countless.
    The new edition of "Dream of the Red Chamber" uses the Cheng Weiyuan movable-type edition of 1792 (the Renzi year of Qianlong) as its base text (this is the earliest complete 120-chapter version available). Errors in the base text that must be corrected are listed in the collation notes with reasons or textual basis; significant discrepancies between the base text and other versions are listed in the collation notes for reference and comparison; even minor details of a single character, if it involves the content, are also listed in the collation notes. On the other hand, the respect for the base text can be seen from the book's "Publication Notes," especially for some special usages, colloquialisms, and special fonts in classical popular novels, which are easily guessed at, altered, or lightly changed. The new edition has made more thorough and prudent considerations, showing the seriousness and rigor of the collation spirit, and sometimes adding brief discussions and explanations in the collation notes.

### 新版“红楼梦”

    新版“红楼梦”
    刚刚由人民文学出版社出版的新版 红楼梦，有不少特色。书中除了有版画 插图，有作者小像外；在正文方面，采 用简字、横排的版式；注释工作，更为精确；正文后面，还附有丰富的校记。
    要说明新版红楼梦的特点，恐怕还得从头回顾一下。乾隆年代的程刻本，流传极罕，所谓“程甲本”，“程乙本”，十分难得。专家们在“甲”“乙”之间的优劣异同上，曾有过些辩论。可是截至新版校订工作开始时为止，仅仅能借到的一部很珍贵的“程甲本”，还是十分残缺的，并无完书。旧日坊间流传的，全部是道光间王刻本的辗转翻刻，百十年间，讹错相沿；胡适等人大事标榜的亚东本，校订疏陋，全不可靠，至于标点分段的谬误可议之处，更不知凡几。
    新版红楼梦以乾隆壬子1792年程伟元活字本为底本（这是目前所能得到的最早的一百二十回本完整本）。底本的讹错，必须改正的，都在校记中列明了理由或版本根据；底本和其他版本文字出入较重大的，都列入校记，以资参考比较；即是一字之微的小节，如果它牵涉到内容方面，也在校记中加以列举。另一方面，对底本的尊重，也可以由本书的“出版说明”看出，特别是古典通俗小说中的一些特殊用语、俗语、特殊字体等，容易被人臆改、轻改的地方，新版都作了较周详审慎的考虑，表示了校订精神的认真和严肃，有时还在校记中酌加了简要的议叙和说明。
