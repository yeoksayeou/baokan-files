Xinhua News Agency Report: According to the joint instruction from the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education regarding the "General Survey of Chinese Dialects," the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education began a survey of dialects throughout the province in January of this year. By the end of August, the survey work for all 113 counties and cities in the province had been completed.

They plan to first write a "Manual on How People from a Certain Locality Can Learn Mandarin Chinese," using regions where the dialectal phonological system is similar or identical to Beijing pronunciation as examples. Then, they will write several volumes based on each major dialect (such as Cantonese, Min, Hakka, etc.) for reference by people in various dialect areas learning Mandarin Chinese. They are currently organizing and studying the materials obtained from the survey in preparation for writing, and it is expected that all drafts can be finalized by February of next year.

　　广东正着手编写学习普通话手册
    据新华社讯　根据高等教育部、教育部关于“汉语方言普查”的联合指示，广东省教育厅从今年1月开始普查全省的方言。到8月底止，已完成了全省一百一十三个县市的普查工作。
    他们计划就方言音韵系统同北京音相似或相同地区为例先写一本“某地人怎样学习普通话手册”，然后再根据每种大的方言（如粤语、闽语、客家话等）分写若干册，以供各方言区人民学习普通话的参考。现在他们正在整理研究普查所得材料，准备编写，预计明年2月可以全部定稿。
