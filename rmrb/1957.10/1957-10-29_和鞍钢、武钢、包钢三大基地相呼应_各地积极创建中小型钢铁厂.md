　　Echoing the Three Major Bases of Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel

　　Various Regions Actively Establish Small and Medium-Sized Iron and Steel Plants

　　Guangdong: The Guangzhou Iron and Steel United Factory began construction on the 7th of this month. It is planned to be completed by the end of 1958. After the plant is built and put into production, it can produce 100,000 tons of foundry pig iron and 40,000 tons of various rolled steel products, which can meet the basic construction needs of Guangdong Province.

　　The machinery and equipment of this iron and steel joint factory are all made in China, and most of the raw materials and fuel required by the factory are locally sourced. Therefore, the cost of steel produced is about 20% lower than that of steel transported from other places.

　　Shandong: The Jinan Iron Plant began construction on the 25th. The first blast furnace will produce iron by May 1st next year. By 1959, after all four blast furnaces are completed, they can produce 147,000 tons of cast iron and pig iron annually.

　　This plant is very close to the Guodian Iron Mine, with convenient transportation and sufficient water sources. Some main materials, such as manganese, coke, and refractory materials, can be supplied nearby.

　　Henan: The Jiaozuo and Anyang small iron smelting plants in Henan Province have recently begun construction one after another.

　　The scale of the two small iron smelting plants is roughly the same, with an annual output of about 20,000 tons of pig iron each. The total investment is around 2 million yuan, and it is expected to be officially put into production in the second quarter of next year.

　　Iron ore is widely distributed in Henan Province. After several years of geological survey and exploration since liberation, iron ore has been discovered in 45 counties. The iron content of these iron ores is generally around 50%. Many mining areas are close to cities or along railways, making it very beneficial to establish small iron smelting plants.

　　Sichuan: The Maoling Iron Smelting Plant in Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, is under construction.

　　After this iron smelting plant is completed, it can produce 10 to 15 tons of iron per day. The pig iron produced by this plant will reduce the production cost of small iron factories and ironware production cooperatives in the autonomous prefecture by one-third. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　Zhejiang: Abundant iron ore is deposited in the Lizhu area of Shaoxing, Zhejiang. In order to extract and smelt the iron ore here to supply the industrial production and construction needs of Shanghai and Zhejiang Province, Shaoxing is currently building a small iron smelting plant. The first blast furnace is expected to be completed in October. (Attached picture)

### 和鞍钢、武钢、包钢三大基地相呼应  各地积极创建中小型钢铁厂

    和鞍钢、武钢、包钢三大基地相呼应
    各地积极创建中小型钢铁厂
    广东　广州钢铁联合工厂，已于本月7日动工兴建。计划在1958年底建成，这个厂建成投入生产后，可生产铸造生铁十万吨，各种轧钢四万吨，能满足广东省的基本建设需要。
    这个钢铁联合工厂的机器和设备都是我国自制的，工厂所需的原料和燃料，多是就地取材，所以生产出来的钢材成本要比外地运来的钢材低20％左右。

    山东　济南铁厂于25日动工兴建。到明年五一节，第一座高炉就可出铁，到1959年，四座高炉全部建成后，每年可生产十四万七千吨铸铁和生铁。
    这个厂离郭店铁矿很近，交通方便，水源充足，一些主要材料，如锰、焦炭、耐火器材等，都可就近得到供应。
    河南　河南省焦作和安阳两座小型炼铁厂最近先后动工兴建。
    两个小型炼铁厂的规模大体相同，年产生铁各为两万吨左右，总投资都在二百万元上下，预计明年第二季度便能正式投入生产。
    河南省铁矿分布很广，经过解放后几年来的地质普查勘探，已有四十五个县发现了铁矿。这些铁矿的含铁量一般在50％左右。不少的矿区靠近城市，或者在铁路沿线，创办小型炼铁厂很有利。　　（据新华社讯）
    四川　四川省阿坝藏族自治州茅岭炼铁厂正在筹建。
    这个炼铁厂建成后，能日产铁十吨到十五吨。自治州小型铁工厂和铁器生产合作社用这个厂生产的生铁，将使产品成本降低三分之一。　（据新华社讯）
    浙江在浙江绍兴漓渚地区，蕴藏着丰富的铁矿。为了把这里的铁矿开采出来，加以熔炼，供应上海和浙江省工业生产和建设的需要。目前绍兴正在兴建一座小型炼铁厂。第一座高炉预计10月份就能建成。（附图片）
