　　Every Achievement of Anshan Iron and Steel is a Crystallization of Sino-Soviet Friendship
　　National Model Worker Wang Chonglun

　　We, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution with joy and excitement. Every achievement of Anshan Iron and Steel is affectionately called a crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship by its workers. Indeed, life itself clearly tells us that the Soviet people are our brothers as close as limbs. When we were deeply enslaved by Japanese imperialism, it was the Soviet Red Army that helped us gain liberation with their own blood; when Anshan Iron and Steel, devastated by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, returned to the hands of the people, and we faced all kinds of difficulties, the great Soviet government and people extended a friendly hand, providing us with tremendous assistance from technology to equipment, from design to construction. They also sent outstanding experts to bring the world's top technology to help us build. In this way, in just over five years, Anshan Iron and Steel has not only recovered from the rubble of war, but has also undergone tremendous development. We have built thirty-three key projects, including five large-scale rolling mills such as seamless, large, and thin plate mills; six automated blast furnaces, seven ore dressing and sintering plants, two huge steelmaking plants, nine new-style coke ovens, and two refractory workshops. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the help of Soviet experts, we have mastered advanced technologies such as rapid steelmaking and high-temperature blast furnace ironmaking. Therefore, the production of Anshan Iron and Steel has been leaping forward at an annual growth rate of 36.4%. In the past, we could only produce more than 500 kinds of products, but today we are able to supply more than 5,000 kinds of product specifications needed by the whole country.

　　In June 1954, Comrade Chizhelev, a young Soviet lathe operator from the Soviet Youth Delegation, came to our factory to demonstrate high-speed cutting, which greatly inspired all our employees. We promoted the technical materials given to us by Comrade Chizhelev like treasures in production. Since then, our workshop has fully and universally carried out high-speed cutting. The workshop's average labor productivity increased by 75%, so in 1954 and 1956, we gloriously completed two years' worth of work in one year. Later, Comrade Fyodorov, a Soviet youth lathe operator, demonstrated powerful cutting in our workshop. After the various workshops under our chief mechanical engineer widely promoted powerful cutting, they greatly improved equipment efficiency and comprehensively completed the task of processing orders for Anshan Iron and Steel's various factories and mines and basic construction departments. At this time, we couldn't help but say: "Write to the Soviet big brother and let them share the happiness of our common labor harvest."

　　Recently, we were very happy to see the success of the Soviet Union in manufacturing intercontinental missiles and launching the first artificial earth satellite. This is a powerful guarantee for world peace and human happiness, and it has strengthened our unwavering belief in taking the socialist road. We must warmly respond to the call of the Party, earnestly learn from the Soviet people's spirit of building the country diligently and frugally, their spirit of hard work and plain living, and learn all kinds of advanced experiences. All the employees of our youth tool workshop have already overfulfilled the task of saving 70,000 yuan of wealth for the whole year by 43% in June this year. In the second half of the year, we will better promote the Soviet high-speed cutting experience and save another 80,000 yuan for the country.

　　In the previous period, right-wing elements tried their best to provoke and undermine the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. We solemnly warn the right-wing gentlemen: every worker protects the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union like protecting their own eyes. Whoever wants to destroy it will be battered and bloodied. We will always learn from the Soviet Union, always regard the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in the great cause of communism as a guide for our progress and a model for learning, and always advance shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet people in the cause of defending socialist unity and lasting world peace!

　　Long live the great October Revolution!
　　Long live the great unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    鞍钢每项成就都是中苏友谊的结晶
    全国工业劳动模范　王崇伦
    我们鞍钢的每一个工人都以欢欣鼓舞的心情庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。鞍钢的工人把自己每一项成就都亲切地称为中苏友谊的结晶。的确，生活本身清楚地告诉了我们，苏联人民是我们如同手足一般亲的兄弟。当我们深受日本帝国主义奴役时，是苏联红军以自己的鲜血来帮助我们获得了解放；当惨遭日本帝国主义和国民党反动派破坏的鞍钢回到人民手里，我们面临着种种困难的时候，伟大的苏联政府和人民又伸出友谊的手，从技术到设备、从设计到施工，给我们以巨大的援助。并派来了出色的专家带来世界上最头等的技术来帮助我们建设。这样，在短短的五年多，我们鞍钢不仅从战争毁坏的瓦砾上恢复了，而且有了巨大的发展。我们已经建成了三十三项重点工程，其中包括无缝、大型、薄板等五座规模巨大的轧钢厂；六座自动化高炉，七座选矿和烧结厂，两座巨大的炼钢厂，九座新式焦炉和两个耐火车间。由于党的正确领导，由于苏联专家的帮助，我们掌握了快速炼钢、高风温炼铁等先进技术，因而我们鞍钢的生产每年以增长36.4％的速度飞跃前进着。过去我们只能生产五百多种产品，而今天已经能够供应全国所需要的五千多种产品规格了。
    1954年6月苏联青年代表团青年车工奇基列夫同志来我厂表演高速切削，这对我们全体职工启发很大。我们把奇基列夫同志赠给我们的技术资料，像宝贝一样地在生产中推广。从此我们车间就全面、普遍地开展了高速切削。车间平均提高了劳动生产率75％，因而在1954年和1956年内，我们光荣地以一年时间完成了二年的工作量。后来苏联青年旋工费奥德罗夫同志又在我车间表演强力切削。我们总机械师所属各车间，在广泛推广强力切削以后，大大地提高了设备效率，全面完成了鞍钢各厂矿同基本建设各部门加工订货的任务。在这个时候，我们情不自禁地说：写信告诉苏联老大哥，让他们和我们共享共同劳动收获的幸福。”
    最近，我们看到了苏联制造洲际导弹和发射第一颗人造地球卫星成功，十分高兴。这是世界和平和人类幸福的强有力的保障，这加强了我们走社会主义道路不可动摇的信念。我们一定热烈地响应党的号召，认真地学习苏联人民勤俭建国、艰苦朴素的精神，学习各种先进经验。我们青年工具车间的全体职工，今年6月份已超额43％完成了全年节约七万元财富的任务，下半年还要更好地推广苏联高速切削经验，再为国家节约八万元。
    前一个期间，右派分子极力挑拨、破坏中苏两国人民的牢不可破的友谊。我们正告右派先生们：每一个工人保护中苏两国人民之间的友谊像保护自己眼珠一样，谁要想破坏它，谁就会碰得头破血流。我们永远向苏联学习，永远把苏联在伟大的共产主义事业中的光辉成就作为前进的指南和学习的榜样，永远和苏联人民在保卫社会主义团结和世界持久和平事业中并肩前进！
    伟大的十月革命节万岁！
    中苏两国人民大团结万岁！
