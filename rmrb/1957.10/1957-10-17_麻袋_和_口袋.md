　　“Sack” and “Pocket”
　　Feng Jiannan
    It's autumn now, and on the Chahar Right Wing Banner grassland, the weather is starting to get cold. However, the room feels stuffy—not only because there's a heated kang, and the kang and the space around it are crowded with people, but also because people are debating.
    "So, why should we unite with the middle peasants?" Rich middle peasant Lu Rui, sitting on the kang, raised his voice to the crowd, waving his pipe. "You tell me, should we unite with the middle peasants?"
    Lu Rui raised this question to put people in a difficult position. It turned out that the poor peasants wanted him to explain why he was complaining everywhere that the cooperative wasn't taking care of him. His answer was: his mother was sick and couldn't even get a bowl of sugar water, and the cooperative wouldn't give him a loan; this spring his mother died, and the cooperative still wouldn't give him a loan; isn't this not taking care of him? Why did poor peasant Jin Zhong get a loan when his mother died? The crowd retorted that the cooperative gave Jin Zhong a loan because he needed to buy a coffin for his mother's funeral, but your family clearly already has one, so of course they wouldn't give you a loan. At this moment, twenty-one-year-old cowherd Wang Wang added, "Next year for your mother's anniversary, are we supposed to give you a loan to hold a memorial service?" Lu Rui got angry and raised the question of "whether to unite with the middle peasants."
    Lu Rui's question had an effect, and people were speechless for at least a minute—uniting with the middle peasants, that's policy! Who can say we shouldn't unite with the middle peasants?
    Wang Wang was quick-witted. He countered:
      "Third Old Man! I want to ask you: why did you raise this question?"
    Then, people started shouting again:
    "Sack is saying that the poor peasants are taking advantage and the cooperative can't function without the middle peasants!"
      "Sack, is this your thinking?"
    "He can't forget his animal-drawn cart! It's not like he wasn't compensated for it!"
    "Like in the first few years after liberation, hiring labor, running transport, lending at usurious rates, how proud he was!"
    Here, "Third Old Man" and "Sack" both refer to Lu Rui. Lu Rui has four brothers, and he's the third, so young people call him Third Old Man to his face; but behind his back, they call him "Sack." Older people also call him "Sack" to his face, because people say he's greedy, always wanting to fill his own sack; but it's a sack that always feels like it's not full enough.
      "I never said the poor peasants were taking advantage. I don't have that kind of thinking! Walking the socialist road, who can take advantage of whom? I'm just saying that the poor peasants need to unite with the middle peasants."
    "You don't have that kind of thinking?" Lu Rui's younger brother, Lu Fu, challenged. "I heard you say it—"
    "I didn't say anything!"
    "Didn't say anything! 'Jia Chang made his fortune off me!' Didn't you say that?"
    "I didn't say that!"
      "The day before yesterday in the oat field, what did you say to me?" Elementary school teacher Hu Hao suddenly asked.
    "What did I say? I didn't say anything!"
    "You said you couldn't reconcile with the new ways, you said 'my bones are supporting Jia Chang's flesh,' you said that, didn't you?!"
    Lu Rui lowered his head and didn't speak.
      "Did you say that or not?"
    "I said it." Lu Rui took his pipe out of his mouth.
      "Quick, explain yourself!" Production team leader Li Mingshan said. "Jia Chang made his fortune off you? Your bones are supporting Jia Chang's flesh?"
    Just as the crowd was about to press Lu Rui, a hoarse but stern voice suddenly came from the corner:
    "Let me say something too!"
    Everyone, except for the infants and toddlers sleeping soundly on the kang or in their parents' arms, stared at the old man Jia Chang sitting in the corner. Li Mingshan moved the lamp on the kang to shine on old man Jia Chang. This was an old man who was blind, hard of hearing, and spoke indistinctly, and was the first person in the village to stand up and be emancipated. People called him Old Man Jia, and also called him "Pocket," because in the dozen years before liberation, he carried a pocket every day, taking his wife (a mute woman) and children to beg from door to door. Jia Chang still treasures that begging pocket. How bad he was at speaking! The debate had been going on for several days, and Jia Chang had come every time, but this was the first time he had spoken.
      "Everyone knows I'm a person who suffered a lot. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party came and I was completely emancipated." The old man said, one word at a time. "When I was young, I worked as a long-term laborer at the sheep herder landlord's house, and suffered all kinds of hardships. They told me to stir-fry oats, and I stirred them for three days and three nights straight. My eyes were damaged, I couldn't work, they wouldn't treat me, and instead kicked me out the door. I had no choice but to beg. Leaning against door frames, eating cold cakes, living in broken temples, drinking the north wind, I suffered all kinds of hardships..." At this point, the old man sobbed. After a while, he continued, "The People's Liberation Army came, and things finally got better. We were given houses, we were given land. The bitter days were over. Cooperatives were formed, collectivization, and that was even better. According to labor, walking the socialist road. I'm old, and my eyes aren't good, but I don't sit idle. Accumulating fertilizer, carrying manure, plowing the land, picking up stones, I can still do it. My son earns a lot of work points. Last year, the first year of collectivization, after setting aside enough grain to eat, we were allocated seventy-two yuan of surplus grain money. Everyone said Jia Chang had made a fortune. When they told me it was money, I didn't believe it. It must be a dream... If it weren't for Chairman Mao, how could..." The old man cried again. He used his aged, hardened palm to wipe his injured eyes. The women were also sobbing. The men were silent.
    "Sack! I'm asking you!" Suddenly Jia Chang stood up and walked to the edge of the kang. "I made my fortune off you? Your bones, your bones..." (People helped him say: "...supporting Jia Chang's flesh?") "You're talking nonsense! I rely on labor, rely on walking the socialist road, rely on Chairman Mao! How could it be relying on you! How could it be relying on your animal-drawn cart! If I had to rely on you, I would have starved to death long ago! Do you remember? I begged at your house, and you wouldn't give me anything, and you even called the dogs to bite me! Last year you even cheated me! A rotten leather pants that had been worn for who knows how many years, you sweet-talked me into buying, something with holes you could poke your finger through, and you wanted nine yuan! You just don't agree with me being emancipated, you..."
    Old Man Jia Chang's body swayed, and he almost fell.
    Li Mingshan and Wang Wang quickly helped the old man onto the kang. Lu Rui poured a bowl of boiling water and brought it close to Jia Chang's mouth. Jia Chang took two sips of water and murmured:
    "Sack... Pocket... Need to reason..."
    Because of the noise and commotion in the room, the infants and toddlers couldn't sleep peacefully and started to cry. The mothers patted them and sang, trying to quiet them down. One mother stroked the hair of the child in her arms and sang:
      "Baby sleep well, let's walk the socialist road with one heart..."
    Li Mingshan said to everyone, "Meeting adjourned! Everyone prepare your opinions, we'll continue the debate tomorrow!"
    But the crowd refused to leave. They waited until Jia Chang sat up, got off the kang, and was helped home by Li Mingshan, Wang Wang, and Lu Rui, before following each other out of the house. The autumn night on the frontier grassland was like a winter night, but the crowd talked about what had just happened and tomorrow's debate, and didn't feel cold.

　　“麻袋”和“口袋”
　　冯健男
    是秋天了，在察北草原，天气开始冷了起来。但是，屋里却显得闷热——这不但因为屋里有热炕，炕上炕下又挤满了人，而且因为人们是在辩论着。
    “这样说起来，为什么要团结中农？”富裕中农鲁瑞坐在炕上，提高了嗓子问大伙，手里挥动着烟袋。“你们说，要不要团结中农？”
    鲁瑞这样提出问题，是为了要将人一军。原来贫农们要他解释：他为什么到处叫唤社里不照顾他。他的回答是：他娘病了，连碗糖水也喝不上，向社里贷款，不贷；今年春天娘死了，向社里贷款，又不贷；这不是不照顾？为什么贫农金忠死了娘就贷了呢？大伙驳他说，社里贷款给金忠，是因为他娘死了要买棺材，你家明摆着棺材一口，当然就不贷给你。在这当口，二十一岁的牛倌王旺偏又多了一句嘴：“明年你娘的周年，难道还要贷款给你开纪念会？”鲁瑞火了，于是提出了“要不要团结中农”的问题。
    鲁瑞这一问倒生了效，人们足有一分钟没能答话——团结中农，这是政策嘛！谁能说不团结中农呢？
    还是王旺机灵。他这样反攻：
      “三老汉！我倒要问你：你干吗提出这问题？”
    跟着，人们又嚷嚷起来了：
    “麻袋是说，贫农占了便宜，离了中农办不了社！”
      “麻袋，你说这是不是你的思想？”
    “总忘不了他那牲口大车！又不是没给他折价！”
    “像解放后头几年那样，雇工，跑运输，放高利贷，有多神气！”
    在这里，“三老汉”和“麻袋”都是指的鲁瑞。鲁瑞兄弟四人，他排行第三，所以年青人当面称他三老汉；但背着他，却叫他“麻袋”。年纪大些的人，当面也叫他“麻袋”，因为人们说他贪心，总想往自己的袋里装；可又是一只总嫌装不满的麻袋。
      “我可没说过贫农占便宜。我可没这思想！走社会嘛，谁能占谁的便宜？我只是说，贫农要团结中农。”
    “你没这思想？”鲁瑞的弟弟鲁福提出了质问。“我就听你说过——”
    “我啥也没说！”
    “啥也没说！‘贾昌发了我的财！’是你说的不是？”
    “我没说这话！”
      “前天在莜麦地里，你对我说了啥？”小学教员胡浩忽然发问。
    “我说啥？没说啥！”
    “你说你思想闹不通，你说‘我的骨头撑起了贾昌的肉’，你说了吧？！”
    鲁瑞低头不语。
      “这话你说了没有？”
    “我说了。”鲁瑞从口里拉出了烟斗。
      “你快解释解释！”生产队长李明山说。“贾昌发了你的财？你的骨头撑起了贾昌的肉？”
    大伙正要追鲁瑞，忽然从墙角里发出喑哑然而严厉的声音：
    “让我也说说！”
    所有的人，除了在炕上或爹妈怀抱中熟睡的婴儿和幼儿以外，都注视着那坐在角落里的贾昌老汉。李明山把炕上的灯移动了一下，使灯光照到贾昌老汉的身上。这是一个双目不明，两耳不灵，口齿不清的老人，是村里的第一个翻身户。人们叫他贾老汉，又叫他“口袋”，因为他在解放前的十几年中，成天背着口袋，带着老婆（一个哑巴女人）孩子沿家讨吃。这讨吃用的口袋贾昌至今还珍藏着。他是多么不善于说话呵！辩论会已经开了好几天，贾昌每次都到，但发言这还是第一次。
      “谁也知道我是受苦人。毛主席共产党过来了我才大翻身。”老汉一句一顿地说。“我年青时候到羊囫囵财主家当长工，受尽了苦。叫我炒莜麦，一连炒三天三夜。眼睛烘坏了，做不了活，不给治，反倒赶我出门。我只好讨吃。靠门框，吃冷糕，住破庙，喝北风，受尽了苦。……”说到这里，老汉呜呜咽咽哭了起来。过了好一会，接着说：“解放军来了，才好了。分了房，分了地。苦日子尽头了。办起了社，高级化，就更好了。按劳嘛，走社会嘛。老了，眼睛不行，可我不闲着。积肥，打滤粪，耧地，拣石头，我还能干。我家小子不少挣分。去年高级化头一年，除了留够吃粮，分到七十二块余粮款。都说我贾昌发了财。告诉我说是钱，我哪里肯信。莫不是做梦。……要不是毛主席，哪能……”老汉又哭起来了。他用那苍老的、发硬的手掌，抹拭着那双受伤的眼睛。妇女们也啜泣起来了。男人们沉默着。
    “麻袋！我问你！”忽然贾昌站起身来，走到炕跟前。“我发了你的财？你的骨头，你的骨头……”（人们帮他说：“……撑起了贾昌的肉？”）“你瞎说！我是靠劳动，靠走社会，靠毛主席！哪能是靠你！哪能是靠你的牲口大车！要靠你，我早饿死了！你记不记得？我讨吃到你家，你不给，还唤狗来咬！去年你还骗了我！一条穿过多少年的烂皮裤，甜言蜜语叫我买了，指头戳得穿的东西，要了我九块钱！你就不同意我翻身，你……”
    贾昌老汉身子晃荡着，差点要倒下来了。
    李明山和王旺赶紧把老汉扶上了炕。鲁瑞倒了一碗开水，挨近贾昌的嘴边。贾昌喝了两口水，喃喃地说：
    “麻袋……口袋……要说理……”
    因为屋子里的嘈杂和忙乱，婴儿和幼儿们睡不安稳，哭闹起来了。妈妈们拍着，唱着，想使他们安静下来。有一个妈妈摸抚着怀中孩子的头发，唱道：
      “宝儿好好睡，齐心走社会……”
    李明山对大伙说。“散会啦！大伙准备好意见，明天接着辩！”
    但是大伙不肯散。一直等到贾昌坐起来，下了炕，由李明山、王旺、鲁瑞扶着回家，才相跟着走出屋子。塞外草原上的秋夜像冬夜，但大伙谈论着刚才发生的事情和明天的辩论，并不觉得冷。
