    Investigating Forests Using Aerial Survey Photos

    The work of investigating forests in the Qilian Mountains using aerial survey photos has begun.

    Currently, a forest management survey team affiliated with the Central Ministry of Forestry, divided into seven groups, has begun field surveys in seven forest areas on the northern and southern slopes of the Qilian Mountains.

    Relevant departments conducted aerial reconnaissance photography of the forests in the Qilian Mountains in 1953. Using aerial survey photos for forest management surveys is an advanced Soviet experience. It not only saves manpower and financial resources, but also has higher accuracy than on-site measurements.

    用空测照片调查森林
    利用航空测量照片调查祁连山区森林的工作开始了。
    目前，中央林业部所属的一个森林经理调查大队，分成七个组在祁连山南北两坡的七个林区开始踏查。
    有关部门在1953年曾经对祁连山区的森林做过航空视察摄影。利用航测照片进行森林经理调查是苏联的先进经验，不仅可以节省人力财力，而且比实地测量的精度还要高。
