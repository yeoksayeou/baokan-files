Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, October 5th: Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report at the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, which opened in Leipzig on the 4th.

Saillant pointed out that in the twelve years since the establishment of the World Federation of Trade Unions, organizational unity of trade unions has been achieved on an international scale. Saillant emphasized that the tasks of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress are: for laborers around the world to wage the most effective struggle to defend their most pressing demands, to assist laborers and all people in various countries in their struggle for democracy, national independence, and peace; and to strengthen the solidarity of laborers in various countries. When discussing the overall international situation, Saillant described the growth of the people's forces opposing imperialist rule.

When discussing the German question, Saillant said that the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France are pursuing a policy of reviving German militarism and arming the West German Bundeswehr in order to turn West German territory into an aggressive base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Saillant then said that the World Federation of Trade Unions has consistently stood on the side of the working people of colonial and semi-colonial countries in the anti-colonialist struggle, providing them with the greatest assistance in defending their democratic and social rights, as well as their daily immediate demands. In this regard, Saillant pointed out that, due to the continuation of the Algerian colonial war, the world trade union movement is required to take active measures to stop military adventures against the Algerian people and recognize their right to national independence. Saillant pointed out that in order to strengthen the solidarity of the international working class, the congress should call for the establishment of an international trade union committee to support the working people of Algeria.

Saillant then cited many specific materials to prove that since 1953, the growth of production and labor productivity in capitalist countries has only brought benefits to monopoly capital.

When discussing the development of trade union movements in various countries, Saillant told the delegates that in 1957, more than 160 million men and women laborers had joined trade union organizations. In recent years, the membership of trade unions in India, Indonesia, Japan, and other countries has greatly increased.

A large part of Saillant's report discussed the economic development and social progress of socialist countries. He cited figures to illustrate that the per capita production of major products is constantly growing. He also cited specific examples of wage increases and improved living standards in various countries of the socialist camp.

Saillant then said that laborers around the world and the World Federation of Trade Unions welcome with pleasure the resumption of friendly and fraternal relations between Yugoslav trade unions and the trade unions of other socialist countries, as well as the national trade unions of capitalist countries participating in the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The final part of Saillant's report stated that the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions recommends that the Fourth World Trade Union Congress adopt a call to national trade union organizations in various countries, and suggests that they begin consultations with each other to jointly formulate and draft the content of a minimum action program acceptable to trade union organizations in various countries. This minimum action program should ensure the consistency of the international trade union movement in order to safeguard the urgent needs of laborers and prepare conditions for promoting the solidarity of various forces in the world trade union movement.

    赛扬在世界工会代表大会上指出
    劳动者当前任务是加强国际团结
    新华社来比锡5日电　世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬在4日在来比锡开幕的世界工会第四次代表大会上做了报告。
    赛扬指出，世界工会联合会成立十二年以来，在国际范围内达到了工会组织上的统一。赛扬强调指出，世界工会第四次代表大会的任务是：全世界劳动者为保卫自己的最迫切的要求而进行最有效的斗争，援助各国的劳动者和全体人民争取民主、民族独立和和平的斗争；加强各国劳动者的团结。赛扬在谈到整个国际形势的时候，叙述了反对帝国主义统治的人民力量的壮大。
    在谈到德国问题的时候，赛扬说，美国、英国、法国的统治集团所以执行复活德国军国主义和武装西德国防军的政策，是为了把西德的领土变成北大西洋公约组织的侵略基地。
    赛扬接着说，世界工联在反殖民主义的斗争中一贯站在殖民地和半殖民地国家的劳动人民的一边，在保卫他们的民主和社会权利以及日常切身要求方面给与他们最大的援助。赛扬在这方面指出，由于阿尔及利亚殖民战争在继续，要求世界工会运动采取积极行动，以求达到制止反对阿尔及利亚人民的军事冒险和承认他们的民族独立权利的目的。赛扬指出，为了加强国际工人阶级的团结，代表大会应当号召建立声援阿尔及利亚劳动人民的国际工会委员会。
    赛扬接着举出了许多具体材料，证明从1953年以来，各资本主义国家的生产和劳动生产率的增长只是给垄断资本带来了利益。
    赛扬在谈到各国工会运动发展情况时向大会代表们说，1957年已经有一亿六千多万男女劳动者加入工会组织。最近几年内，印度、印度尼西亚、日本和其它国家工会的会员人数大大地增加了。
    赛扬报告中有很大一部分谈到了社会主义国家经济发展和社会进步。他列举数字来说明，按人口平均计算主要产品生产量是在不断增长中。他还列举了社会主义阵营各国工资增加和物质生活水平提高的具体事例。
    赛扬接着说，全世界劳动者和世界工联都以愉快的心情欢迎南斯拉夫工会同其它社会主义国家工会以及参加世界工联的资本主义国家全国性工会恢复友好的兄弟关系。
    赛扬的报告的最后部分说，世界工联执行委员会建议世界工会第四次代表大会通过一项告各国全国性工会组织的号召书，并建议它们彼此开始协商，共同来拟定和起草可以为各国工会组织接受的最低行动纲领的内容。这一最低行动纲领应当保证国际工会运动的一致，以求保障劳动者的迫切需要和为促进世界工会运动中各种力量的团结准备条件。
