Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The anti-Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Chemical Industry has basically concluded. On the afternoon of the 17th, a mobilization meeting was held to transition from the anti-Rightist struggle to a stage focused on rectification. Peng Tao, Minister of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, delivered a report at the meeting, calling on all staff to mobilize, speak out freely, and actively participate in rectification. He stated that the Party and the Ministry leadership would ensure that every opinion from the masses is addressed and every matter is resolved.

Peng Tao, after reporting on the general situation and achievements of the Ministry's anti-Rightist struggle, analyzed the more prominent shortcomings of the Ministry at present and explained the handling of opinions raised by the masses during the first stage of the "Great Blooming and Great Contending."

In his report, Peng Tao, in conjunction with the ideological situation of the masses, explained the boundaries between distinguishing Rightist remarks, erroneous remarks, and correct criticisms. He said, we believe that after the anti-Rightist struggle, the consciousness of the broad masses has been raised, and they will certainly be able to respond to the Party's call to unleash boldly, unleash thoroughly, and unleash resolutely. He pointed out: The scope and form of speaking out are not subject to any restrictions; whether using discussions, writing big-character posters, etc., people can speak their minds freely, no matter what opinions they have.

Finally, Peng Tao talked about the method of rectification. He said that for the opinions of the masses, those that can be rectified immediately or in the short term must be rectified quickly; rely on the masses, study together with the masses, and rectify with a plan and a program; for opinions involving external and higher-level organs, they must be promptly reflected to the relevant departments and higher-level organs; for incorrect opinions, everyone can be allowed to conduct debates to clarify right and wrong. In short, we must boldly rectify, thoroughly rectify, and resolutely rectify all shortcomings and errors.

Prior to this, after the basic conclusion of the anti-Rightist struggle, the Ministry of Chemical Industry and its affiliated units had successively carried out a series of preparatory work in terms of ideology, organization, and rectification content. Within and outside the Party, various discussion meetings and group meetings were held to discuss the gains of the anti-Rightist struggle and the nature and significance of entering the third stage of the rectification campaign. The rectification offices of the Ministry and its affiliated units also newly established several professional groups to strengthen and enrich the institutions responsible for rectification work. The Ministry's leadership analyzed and sorted out the opinions raised by the masses in the first "Great Blooming and Great Contending," and basically handled the problems that could be resolved.

    新华社18日讯  化学工业部反右派斗争已经基本结束，17日下午召开了由反右派斗争转入着重整改阶段的动员大会。化学工业部部长彭涛在会上作了报告，号召全体工作人员动员起来，大鸣大放，积极参加整改。他表示党和部的领导上对群众的意见一定做到条条有交代，事事有着落。
    彭涛在报告了这个部反右派斗争的概况和收获后，接着对这个部目前比较突出的缺点作了分析，并对处理群众在第一阶段大鸣大放中提出的意见的情况作了说明。
    彭涛在报告中结合群众的思想情况，对于分辨右派言论、错误言论和正确评批之间的界限作了说明。他说，我们相信经过反右派斗争，广大群众觉悟提高了，一定能够响应党的号召，大胆的放、彻底的放、坚决的放。他指出：鸣放的范围和形式不受任何限制；采用座谈、贴写大字报等都可以，不管有什么意见都可以畅所欲言。
    最后彭涛谈了关于改的方法问题。他说，对于群众的意见，凡是可以立即或短期能够改正的，必须很快改正；依靠群众、同群众共同研究，有计划有方案的改；涉及到外部和上级机关的意见，一定及时反映给有关部门和上级机关；对不正确的意见，可以让大家展开辩论，弄清是非。总之，我们对一切缺点和错误，都要大胆的改、彻底的改、坚决的改。
    在此之前，化工部和所属单位在反右派斗争基本结束后，曾分别从思想上、组织上和整改内容方面先后进行了一系列的准备工作。党内党外通过各种座谈会、小组会，讨论了反右派斗争的收获和转入整风第三阶段的性质和意义。部和所属各单位的整风办公室还新设了若干专业小组，加强和充实了负责整改工作的机构。部的领导方面根据群众在第一次大鸣大放中提出的意见进行了分析和排队，对其中有条件解决的问题基本上都作了处理。
