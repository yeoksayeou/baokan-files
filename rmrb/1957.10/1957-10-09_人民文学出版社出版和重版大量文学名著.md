    People's Literature Publishing House
    Publishes and Reprints a Large Number of Literary Classics
    During the rectification campaign, the People's Literature Publishing House actively improved its work and plans to publish 90 new literary and art books and reprint 124 books in the fourth quarter of this year, with an estimated circulation of more than 4,230,000 copies.
    The publishing house will publish classical literary works such as "Selected Works of Mencius," "Selected Works of Xunzi," "Selected Poems of Su Shi," "Marvelous Tales Old and New," and "The Travels of Lao Can." It will also publish a batch of works by older writers from the "May Fourth" era, such as "Selected Works of Ying Xiuren and Pan Mohua," "Selected Novels of Fei Ming," Qi Tong's "New Generation," Feng Zikai's "Essays from the Edge of Destiny Studio," and volumes 5, 6, and 8 of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun." New works to be published include Qu Bo's "Tracks in the Snowy Forest" and the "Selected Poems of Li Mutalifu" by the ethnic minority writer Kerim Hojayev, and so on. Translated works will also be published, such as "One Thousand and One Nights" (Volume 1), "Selected Works of Tagore," Aragon's "The Communists," and Mark Twain's "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court." Around the anniversary of the October Revolution, a large number of translated versions of Soviet literary classics will also be published. The publishing house has revised its reprint plan, which includes the most out-of-print Chinese classical literary works, such as "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and "Three Hundred Tang Poems." Forty to fifty outstanding literary works since the "May Fourth" Movement are planned for reprinting, including works or selected works by Mao Dun, Ba Jin, Ye Shengtao, Lao She, Zhu Ziqing, Wen Yiduo, Zang Kejia, Cao Yu, and Xia Yan. Dozens of new creative works will also be reprinted. Literary history and several theoretical readings will also be reprinted successively. For world classical literary masterpieces that have been out of print for a long time and have not been reprinted for several years, it has been decided to reprint representative works by Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Balzac, Lesage, and Fielding. In addition, Volumes 1 to 3 of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun" and "Anna Karenina," etc., have also been reprinted once.
