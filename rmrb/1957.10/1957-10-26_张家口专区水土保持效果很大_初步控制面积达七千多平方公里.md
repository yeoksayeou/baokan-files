    Report from our newspaper:
    The Zhangjiakou Prefecture of Hebei Province, characterized by its high terrain, dry and windy climate, and severe soil erosion, has achieved remarkable results in soil and water conservation over the past few years due to the comprehensive management measures adopted by the Party and the government and the widespread mass campaign. Soil erosion has been initially controlled in an area of 7,842 square kilometers. Many mountainous areas have achieved flood control at every level, water storage everywhere, no mud leaving the gullies, and no water leaving the fields, transforming muddy water into a clear, continuous flow. The area of cultivated land has expanded, crop yields have increased, and animal husbandry and forestry have developed considerably. Some mountain villages have transformed from grain-deficient villages into surplus grain villages, and people's lives are thriving. For example, Taogou Village in Huaian County had an average yield of 60 jin per mu before liberation. After only four years of managing the gullies and slopes, the yield per mu reached 208 jin, with an average of 980 jin of raw grain per person. The lives of the masses have become prosperous.
    Soil and water conservation is a long-term basic construction project, requiring a lot of labor and yielding returns slowly. Farmers have the idea that "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst." In the work, how to combine long-term interests with current interests has become the primary link in mobilizing the masses. The basic method for Party and government leaders in Zhangjiakou Prefecture to solve this problem is to make soil and water conservation work serve current farmland production as much as possible. By repairing terraced fields, building field ridges, and diverting floodwaters for irrigation, this increases current income. Last year, the region harvested 6 million jin of grain by planting crops in contour ditches and fish-scale pits. Qijiazhuang Sluice Gully in Xuanhua County reclaimed 183 mu of land, yielding 21,200 jin of grain. This year, the Gaomiaobao Agricultural Cooperative in Wanquan County used contour ditches, fish-scale pits, terraced fields, and dammed gullies to plant melons, beans, vegetables, sunflowers, etc., with a total output value of 2,578 yuan. If afforestation of barren mountains is well-managed, there will be income from by-products in three to five years.
    In carrying out soil and water conservation work, the Party and government leaders of Zhangjiakou Prefecture implemented the central government's policy of "overall planning, comprehensive development, simultaneous treatment of gullies and slopes, and concentrated management." Initially, lacking experience, they also took detours. When soil and water conservation work began in 1951, it relied solely on state investment to manage gullies and build dams, and the projects were very scattered. As a result, "big floods caused big冲(damage?), small floods caused small冲(damage?)." The results were not significant, and there was considerable waste. In 1954, initial experience was gained through key demonstrations. After the realization of advanced cooperation, unified land management and unified allocation of labor created favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of soil and water conservation. In 1956, comprehensive management began to be implemented universally, and different measures combining "adaptation," "utilization," and "transformation" were taken according to the different characteristics of different regions, making gully land into river terraces, sloping land into terraced fields, and barren hillsides green. Changjiagou in Huaian County made stone fish-scale pits on rocky mountains, which not only intercepted and stored soil and water but also enabled afforestation.
    Soil and water conservation is a comprehensive task, and agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry must be closely combined, and various economies must develop accordingly. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, Zhangjiakou Prefecture organized various relevant departments based on the principles of "combining top and bottom, considering both left and right, with the cooperative as the main body, and balancing the county and township," and formulated a comprehensive plan according to needs and development indicators. Last winter and this spring, the prefecture and county governments transferred more than 200 cadres to help 64 townships make long-term plans for mountain area construction. At present, mountain townships and cooperatives have specific construction plans. Through planning, the masses have been vividly and specifically educated, thereby strengthening the confidence of the people in the mountain areas to build socialism.
    In the future, Zhangjiakou Prefecture needs to continue to complete the soil and water conservation task of more than 15,000 square kilometers, which requires more than 68 million man-days of labor. The Party and government leaders and all farmers of Zhangjiakou Prefecture are determined to complete this task in five to ten years respectively and initially control soil erosion. By then, the impoverished appearance of the mountainous areas will be fundamentally changed. The wish of "sloping land turning into terraced fields, dry gullies turning into orchards, pine and cypress trees on high mountains, and willows everywhere along the riverbanks" will become a reality.

    张家口专区水土保持效果很大
    初步控制面积达七千多平方公里
    本报讯　地势高亢、气候干燥多风、水土流失十分严重的河北省张家口专区，几年来由于党和政府采取综合治理措施，开展了群众性的水土保持工作，已在七千八百四十二平方公里的面积中，初步控制了水土流失。不少山区已经做到节节拦洪、处处蓄水，泥不出沟、水不出田，混水变成了清水长流，耕地面积扩大，农田产量增长，畜牧业和林业都有了相当的发展。有的山村由缺粮村变成了余粮村，人民生活欣欣向荣。如怀安县桃沟村解放前平均亩产六十斤，仅经四年的治理沟坡，每亩产量达到二百零八斤，每人平均原粮九百八十斤。群众生活已经富裕起来。
    水土保持是长期性的基本建设，用工多，收益迟，农民中有“远水不解近渴”的思想。在工作中如何把长远利益与目前利益结合起来，就成为发动群众的首要环节。张家口专区党政领导解决这一问题的基本办法，是使水土保持工作尽可能为当年农田生产服务。通过修梯田、培地埂、引洪浇地等项工作，增加当年的收益。去年全区利用水平沟和鱼鳞坑种植作物，即收获粮食六百万斤。宣化县祁家庄闸沟垫地一百八十三亩，打粮二万一千二百斤。今年万全县高庙堡农业社利用水平沟、鱼鳞坑、梯田和谷坊坝点种瓜豆、蔬菜、葵花等，总产值有二千五百七十八元。荒山造林，如果抚育的好，三、五年后就有副产收入。
    张家口专区的党政领导在开展水土保持工作当中，贯彻执行了中央指出的“全面规划、综合开发、沟坡兼治、集中治理”的方针。最初缺乏经验，也曾走过弯路。1951年开始进行水土保持工作的时候，单纯靠国家投资治沟修谷坊，而且工程很零散，因而“大水大冲，小水小冲”，收效不大，浪费不小。1954年经过重点示范，初步得到了经验。实现高级合作化以后，土地统一经营和劳力统一支配，为全面开展水土保持创造了有利条件。1956年开始普遍进行综合治理，按照不同地区的不同特征，因地制宜地采取“适应”、“利用”、“改造”相结合的不同措施，使沟地川台化，坡地梯田化，荒山坡绿化。怀安县常家沟在石头山上做石砌鱼鳞坑，不但能够拦蓄水土，而且能够植树造林。
    水土保持是综合性的工作，农林水牧均需密切结合，各种经济必须相应发展。张家口专区在党委的统一领导下，组织各有关部门本着“上下结合、左右兼顾、以社为主、县乡平衡”的原则，根据需要与发展指标，制定了全面规划。去冬今春，专、县抽调二百多名干部帮助六十四个乡作了山区建设的远景规划。目前山区乡、社都有了具体的建设方案。通过规划，生动具体地教育了群众，从而坚定了山区人民建设社会主义的信心。
    张家口专区今后需要继续完成一万五千多平方公里的水土保持任务，光人工即需要六千八百多万个。张家口专区的党政领导和全体农民决心在五年至十年内分别完成这一任务，初步控制水土流失。到那时，山区的贫困面貌将会根本改变。“坡地变梯田，干沟变果园，高山松柏树，杨柳遍河滩”的愿望将成为现实。
