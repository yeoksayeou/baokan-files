Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from New York: According to a report from the "New York Post" correspondent in Washington, Allen, the United States is dispatching one hundred and fifty of the latest model jet fighters to Turkey.

Another source said: The flagship of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, the cruiser "Albany," arrived at Souda Bay on the island of Crete on the 17th; the missile cruiser "Canberra," accompanied by several smaller warships, will head to Izmir, Turkey; and the giant attack aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" is sailing towards the Greek island of Rhodes, southwest of Turkey.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from New York: American newspapers continue to issue anti-Syrian clamor.

The "New York Times" supported Dulles' provocative remarks at a press conference on the 16th, which is that the United States will always support Turkey's current foreign policy, even to the point of using force. The newspaper particularly praised the fact that Turkish troops were gathering on the Turkish-Syrian border, and openly said that doing so was "intended to influence the course of events in Syria."

The newspaper also said that the United States is doing its utmost to show its "unity" with Turkey. Dulles' remarks show that he has placed his bet on Turkey.

The "New York Herald Tribune" also advocated that the U.S. "Sixth Fleet must be on alert at any time, the Strategic Air Command must be on alert at any time; and the United States' allies must be strengthened in Israel, Turkey, and elsewhere."

It can be seen from some newspaper reports that the United States is currently playing two diplomatic tricks. On the one hand, it is urging Turkey to intensify its aggressive actions against Syria. However, on the other hand, in order to appease world public opinion, U.S. officials and some newspapers are attempting to create the impression that the tense situation in the Middle East has eased, and are stubbornly claiming that Turkey has no ambition to invade Syria.

　　美国派飞机军舰往土耳其
    美报竭力为杜勒斯的反叙叫嚣帮腔
    新华社18日讯  纽约消息：据“纽约邮报”驻华盛顿记者艾伦报道，美国正在派遣一百五十架最新式的喷气歼击机到土耳其。
    还有消息说：美国第六舰队的旗舰、巡洋舰“奥尔巴尼号”，17日驶达克里特岛的苏达湾；导弹巡洋舰“坎培拉号”在几艘比较小型的军舰的陪同下将开往土耳其的伊兹密尔；巨型进击航空母舰“罗斯福号”正在驶往土耳其西南海面上的希腊岛屿罗得岛。
    据新华社18日讯纽约消息：美国报刊继续发出反叙利亚的叫嚷。
    “纽约时报”支持杜勒斯在16日记者招待会上发表的挑衅性谈话，这就是：美国永远支持土耳其目前的外交方针，一直到使用武力。这家报纸特别赞扬土耳其军队在土叙边境集结的事实，并且公开说这样做是“打算影响叙利亚事变的进程”。
    这家报纸还说，美国极力要表明它同土耳其的“团结一致”。杜勒斯的谈话说明他已经把赌注押在土耳其身上。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”也鼓吹美国的“第六舰队随时戒备，战略空军司令部随时戒备；并且必须在以色列、土耳其和其他地方加强美国的盟国”。
    从一些报纸消息中可以看出，美国目前正在玩弄两套外交手法。一方面它催促土耳其加紧对叙利亚进行侵略行动。但是，在另一方面，为了平息世界舆论，美国的官方人士和某些报纸却企图造成一种印象，似乎中东的紧张局势已趋缓和，硬说土耳其没有侵略叙利亚的野心。
