    Two Months of Reasoned Struggle, Over a Dozen Major and Minor Debates
    Experts and Professors of Peking Union Medical College Refute Li Zong'en
    (Our Newspaper's Dispatch) The experts, professors, and all staff members of Peking Union Medical College, after a two-month-long reasoned struggle, refuted the rightist Li Zong'en, who accepted the marshal's baton from Zhang Bojun,妄想图谋篡夺医药界的领导权，企图以资本主义医学教育方向代替社会主义医学教育方向。
    At the twelve major and minor debate meetings, experts and professors pointed out that Li Zong'en's "three-part movement" against the Communist Party's leadership in the medical and health field was: exaggerating and distorting the errors and shortcomings in the work of Peking Union Medical College, obliterating the achievements of the past few years, and blaming these errors and shortcomings on the leadership of the Party, in order to achieve the goal of opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism. In a written opinion, Li Zong'en said: "The quality of Peking Union Medical College's professional work has declined... The losses of Peking Union Medical College in the past few years must have a certain amount of time to restore its vitality." In fact, he wanted to restore the Peking Union Medical College under imperialist rule. Professor Wang Shizhen said that when Peking Union Medical College was taken over, it was led by the Ministry of Health, and Li Zong'en was not satisfied. He proposed that it be led by the Ministry of Higher Education and the Cultural Affairs Commission. Later, when it was led by the Health Department of the Military Commission, he was again dissatisfied. Last year, when it was transferred to the leadership of the Ministry of Health, Li Zong'en again proposed that it be led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. But in January of this year, he said, "The Chinese Academy of Sciences cannot lead medicine." As long as the Communist Party led Peking Union Medical College, he believed that the leadership was not good. During the period of great contending and blooming, in order to win over the masses and overthrow the leadership of the Party, Li Zong'en also tried his best to provoke the relationship between the Party and the masses, saying, "In Peking Union Medical College, the main people are Party and League members, and the experts and professors are placed behind." Li Zong'en clamored that "the entire Peking Union Medical College has fallen into chaos, and the Party committee is simply completely helpless."
    At the debate meeting, experts and professors refuted Li Zong'en's anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds with concrete facts. The professors said that Li Zong'en said that Peking Union Medical College was "not as good as before," but in fact, the achievements of Peking Union Medical College after liberation were not only the main ones, but also enormous. The development of the school's Department of Biochemistry proved that Li Zong'en's argument was groundless. Not only has the Department of Biochemistry greatly supplemented its technical staff, but research work is also flourishing. In 1949, the department did not have a single formal research project, but now it has a complete research plan with nearly twenty research topics. Professor Wang Shizhen said that Li Zong'en said that the status of experts and professors at Peking Union Medical College was "placed behind," but in fact, the heads of all departments were professors. Professors specifically lead all teaching and research work. The Party cares about the work, life, and ideological progress of the professors.
    The professors pointed out that Li Zong'en's conspiracy was that after finding the rightist group of Zhang Bojun as a backer in politics, he used Peking Union Medical College as a stronghold and used Peking Union Medical College and the Peking Union Medical College professors' position in the medical field as private capital to attack the Party. The essence of Li Zong'en's so-called "medical education" system was a semi-colonial, slavish medical education system that served American imperialist cultural aggression in an organized, planned, and programmatic way.
    Li Zong'en's slander that political movements made academic progress backward was also refuted by several professors. Zhou Huakang, director of pediatrics, said that political movements were the fundamental guarantee for the great achievements made by the People's Government after taking over Peking Union Medical College. Peking Union Medical College was a tool for American imperialism to carry out cultural aggression. To transform Peking Union Medical College into an institution that serves the people, and to liberate Peking Union Medical College's cadres from the shackles of colonial servile thought and serious bourgeois thought, requires transformation and political movements. The results of the political movement have confirmed this point. The achievements of the political movement in Peking Union Medical College were enormous. The bad elements of Peking Union Medical College have been purged, and the ranks of cadres have been purified. The rightists opposed political movements not because they cared about the quality of their work, but because they used some people with ambiguous ideas as their political capital to oppose political movements, oppose the Communist Party, and oppose socialism. Zeng Xianjiu, director of surgery, said that Li Zong'en's fallacy was an attempt to create an atmosphere in which the Party could not lead science, thereby overthrowing the Party's leadership in scientific undertakings.
    Several professors refuted Li Zong'en's lie that his anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds were a "matter of ideology." They cited facts to show that Li Zong'en was trying to restore and promote a set of imperialist medical education and medical research. Professor Zhang Xiaoqian said that Li Zong'en was wearing the cloak of a medical educator. His approach was to attack at certain times and retreat at certain times, but in reality, he was still attacking. Professor Zhu Guiqing pointed out that Li Zong'en's strategy after the ideological remolding movement was to defend as attack, opposing all reforms of Peking Union Medical College.
    Li Zong'en's son, Li Shoufu, also exposed Li Zong'en's anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds at a meeting.
    The disclosure materials of many people prove that Li Zong'en was a loyal executor of国民党法西斯教育在医学部门的忠实执行者. Li Zong'en formed a reactionary ruling core with two other secret agents in Guiyang Medical College. They carried out reactionary propaganda among students, promoting Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny" and slandering the Communist Party. He joined the Kuomintang in 1941 and held many important positions.
    Cao Songnian, Liu Yong, Hu Mauhua, Lin Qiaozhi, Deng Jiadong, Li Hongjiong, Hu Zhengxiang, and others spoke at several debate meetings. Medical experts from the capital, Hu ChuanKui, Wu Yingkai, Zhu Futang, and Meng Jimou, also spoke at the meeting. In the face of truth and facts, Li Zong'en began to admit his mistakes.
    Xu Yunbei, Deputy Minister of Health, spoke at the conference on the 21st. He said that with the efforts of all the staff of Peking Union Medical College, the rightists of Peking Union Medical College have been isolated, and many people have furthered their understanding of drawing a clear ideological line between themselves and the rightists, accepting the leadership of the Party, taking the socialist road, and the need for intellectuals to carry out ideological remolding. Many people have received practical training in the anti-rightist struggle, and their ideological awareness has been newly improved. Then he pointed out that the anti-rightist struggle carried out by Peking Union Medical College under the leadership of the Party is an important battlefield of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts of the Chinese medical and health circles. The victory of the anti-rightist struggle in Peking Union Medical College has an important impact on the anti-rightist struggle in the national medical and health circles. He said that the anti-rightist struggle in the medical and health circles is a debate on major political issues of right and wrong. As for academic issues, it has always been advocated that a hundred schools of thought contend, and it should not be confused with the anti-rightist struggle. He said that medical and health personnel across the country should actively participate in the anti-rightist struggle and accept ideological remolding. The task of the anti-rightist struggle in the medical and health circles is very arduous. Although this movement has been launched on the national health front, and some have turned to an in-depth stage, it must be further deepened and carried out, sweeping through all corners, and continuing to work hard to achieve a complete victory.

### 两个月的说理斗争　十几次大小辩论会  协和医学院专家教授驳倒李宗恩

    两个月的说理斗争　十几次大小辩论会
    协和医学院专家教授驳倒李宗恩
    本报讯　中国协和医学院的专家教授和全体工作人员，经过为时两个月的说理斗争，驳倒了从章伯钧手中接受帅印，妄想篡夺医药界领导权，企图以资本主义医学教育方向代替社会主义医学教育方向的右派分子李宗恩。
    在十二次大小辩论会上，专家教授们指出李宗恩反对共产党在医药卫生事业中的领导权的“三部曲”是：夸大和歪曲协和医学院工作上的错误和缺点，抹煞几年来的成就，把这些错误和缺点归罪于党的领导，以达到反共反社会主义的目的。李宗恩在一份书面意见书中说：“协和业务质量方面是降低了……协和这几年的损失必须要有一定的时间，以恢复元气。”实际上就是要恢复帝国主义统治的协和。王世真教授说，协和在接管时由卫生部领导，李宗恩不满意，提出要高教部、文委领导，以后改由军委卫生部领导，他又不满意。去年转由卫生部领导，李宗恩又提出要科学院领导。但今年1月又说“中国科学院不能领导医学”。只要是共产党领导协和他就认为领导不好。在大鸣大放时期，李宗恩为了争取群众，推翻党的领导，他又极力挑拨党群关系说，“在协和主要是党、团员，专家教授摆在后面”。李宗恩叫嚣“整个协和医学院已经陷入了混乱局面，党委简直完全没有办法了。”
    在辩论会上，专家教授们以具体事实批驳了李宗恩的反共反社会主义言行。教授们说，李宗恩别有用心地说协和“今不如昔”，事实上，协和解放后的成绩不仅是主要的，而且是巨大的。以这个学校的生物化学系的发展情况，就证明李宗恩的论点是毫无根据的。生物化学系不仅技术干部有了很大补充，研究工作也在蓬勃开展。1949年，这个系没有一项正式的研究工作，现在却有完整的研究计划，近二十项研究题目。王世真教授说，李宗恩说专家教授的地位在协和是“摆在后面”，事实上各科系主任全是教授。教授具体领导全部教学和研究工作。党对教授们的工作、生活、思想进步都很关怀。
    教授们指出李宗恩的阴谋是在政治上找到了章伯钧右派集团为靠山后，就以协和为据点，利用协和及协和教授们在医学界的地位作为私人资本向党进攻。李宗恩喧嚷的所谓“医学教育”制度的实质，是有组织、有计划、有纲领的为美帝国主义文化侵略服务的半殖民地奴化医学教育制度。
    李宗恩诬蔑政治运动使学术落后的谰言，也被几位教授驳倒。儿科主任周华康说政治运动是人民政府接管协和医学院以后取得巨大成绩的根本保证。协和是美帝国主义进行文化侵略的工具，要把协和变为一个为人民服务的机构，把协和的干部从殖民地奴化思想和严重的资产阶级思想的枷锁中解放出来，需要改造，需要政治运动。政治运动的结果正证实了这一点，协和政治运动取得的成绩是巨大的，协和的坏分子肃清了，干部队伍纯洁了。右派分子反对政治运动，并不是关心业务质量，他们只是利用一部分思想模糊的人作为他们的政治资本来反对政治运动，反对共产党反对社会主义。外科主任曾宪九说，李宗恩的这个谬论是企图造成党不能领导科学的气氛，从而推翻党在科学事业中的领导。
    有几位教授驳斥了李宗恩把他的反共反社会主义言行说成是“思想问题”的谎言。并列举事实说明李宗恩是企图恢复与推行帝国主义的医学教育和医学研究的一套。张孝骞教授说，李宗恩披着医学教育家的外衣，他的做法在某些时候是进攻，在某些时候是退却，但在实际上仍是进攻。朱贵卿教授指出李宗恩在思想改造运动以后的策略是以守为攻，反对对协和的一切改革。
    李宗恩的儿子李寿复在一次会上也揭发了李宗恩的反共反社会主义言行。
    许多人的揭发材料证明，李宗恩是一个国民党法西斯教育在医学部门的忠实执行者。李宗恩在贵阳医学院和另外两个特务分子形成反动统治核心，在学生中进行反动宣传，宣扬蒋介石的“中国之命运”，诬蔑共产党。并在1941年加入了国民党，担任了许多重要职务。
    在几次辩论会上发言的专家教授有曹松年、刘永、胡懋华、林巧稚、邓家栋、李洪迥、胡正祥等。首都的医学专家胡传揆、吴英恺、诸福棠、孟继懋等也在会上发了言。在真理和事实面前，李宗恩开始认错。
    在21日的大会上卫生部副部长徐运北讲了话。他说，在协和全体工作人员的努力下，协和的右派分子已经孤立起来，许多人对与右派分子划清思想界限，接受党的领导，走社会主义道路和知识分子必须进行思想改造方面，都有了进一步的认识。许多人在反右派斗争中受到实际锻炼，思想觉悟有了新的提高。接着他指出，协和医学院在党的领导下开展的反右派斗争，是我国医药卫生界在政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的一个重要战场。协和反右派斗争的胜利对全国医药卫生界反右派斗争也有重要影响。他说，医药卫生界的反右派斗争是大是大非重大政治问题的争论，至于学术问题，历来主张百家争鸣，不应和反右派斗争混淆在一起。他说全国医药卫生人员，都应积极地参加反右派斗争，和接受思想改造。医药卫生界的反右派斗争的任务是十分艰巨的。这一运动在全国卫生战线上虽已开展起来，有的并已转向深入阶段，但还须进一步深入地开展，扫清各个角落，继续努力，以取得彻底的胜利。　（新华社专稿）
