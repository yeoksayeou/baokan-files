　　　(Our dispatch from Hangzhou, October 28) Following the publication of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), a wave of studying and implementing the National Agricultural Development Program has swept across the broad countryside of Zhejiang, from the mountainous areas of Southern Zhejiang to the plains of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, from the Taihu Lake Basin to the coast of the East China Sea, in recent days.

　　　On the day the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) was published, the rural areas of Zhejiang were overjoyed, and agricultural cooperative members spread the word: "The Communist Party has announced a program that is both prosperous and happy." On the plains of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, many agricultural cooperatives installed loudspeakers in the fields to broadcast to the members. After reading the newspaper publishing the National Agricultural Development Program in the fields, members of the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Shuanglin Township, Hang County, immediately started a discussion. Newspapers are scarce in the countryside, so literate cooperative members wrote down the National Agricultural Development Program word for word from the radio. Some elderly cooperative members traveled to distant market towns to buy a newspaper and kept it hidden in their arms, saying, "This is not just a newspaper, it's a treasure. With it, the road ahead becomes brighter and brighter."

　　　After the publication of the National Agricultural Development Program, the broad masses of cadres and farmers are filled with confidence in continuing to implement the provisions of the Forty Articles. More than a thousand cadres attending the provincial Party committee's four-level cadre meeting in Hangzhou held a heated discussion on the National Agricultural Development Program. Everyone agreed that the program draft has been implemented for nearly two years and has already brought about profound changes in the countryside. Cadres from more than twenty counties, including Pingyang, Zhuji, Lanxi, Xindeng, Fuyang, and Putuo, cited many examples to illustrate the tremendous achievements made in the past two years of implementing the program draft. For example, after Zhuji County implemented the program draft, it completed more than six million workdays of water conservancy projects last year, increasing drought resistance to more than forty-five to sixty days. With improved water conservancy conditions, the county vigorously carried out production reforms, increasing the area of double-cropping rice to more than 80% of the county's paddy fields. Due to the increased multiple cropping index, the yield of 350,000 mu of rice in the county reached more than 800 jin per mu last year.

　　　After studying the National Agricultural Development Program, many counties and agricultural cooperatives have formulated agricultural production plans, action plans, and production increase and conservation plans. According to the requirements of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, Zhuji County has proposed to build another six million mu of earthwork for water conservancy projects this year; to increase the number of pigs raised from the current 240,000 to 460,000; and to basically eliminate blank fields this winter and increase the multiple cropping index. The Yulong Fishing Cooperative in Shengsi County also held a members' meeting to plan that during the second Five-Year Plan period from 1958 to 1962, the cooperative would accumulate 1.51 million yuan in funds, plus members' investments, to build another thirty motorized sailing fishing boats, so that 50% of the members would use motorized sailing boats for production, creating conditions for the transition to fishing vessels. After discussing the National Agricultural Development Program, the Jinli Agricultural Cooperative in Haining Xiashi Township also formulated six action plans: 1. Everyone should study the National Agricultural Development Program and publicize its benefits. 2. Ensure careful harvesting and threshing and timely sowing during the autumn harvest and winter planting. 3. Increase the accumulation of soil fertilizer, and the cooperative should add eight more boats to dredge river mud. 4. Reach the goal of raising three pigs per household this winter. 5. Properly arrange labor and production this winter, allowing cooperative members suffering from schistosomiasis to go for treatment in batches. 6. Do a good job in literacy work this winter and restore the cooperative's original seven people's schools.

　　　(Our dispatch from Nanjing, October 28) Since the publication of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, it has been warmly supported by the broad masses of farmers, workers, and intellectuals in Jiangsu Province. They have expressed their determination to use revolutionary spirit to achieve the provisions made in this program in all aspects.

　　　The National Agricultural Development Program draft, published in January 1956, has already played a significant positive role in the rural areas of Jiangsu Province, and the farmers lovingly call it a "guiding light"; now this light has once again stirred up the farmers' confidence and determination to move forward. Many agricultural cooperatives are already re-planning their future work in light of this revised program draft. Ding Changyou, the director of the Longhua Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangpu County, said with confidence: "The program requires our area to reach a grain yield of 800 jin per mu by 1967. As long as we convert most of the fields to double-cropping rice and wheat, and convert some of the dry land into paddy fields, it is entirely possible to harvest 800 jin of grain per mu in three to five years."

　　　Binhai County, which has historically suffered from natural disasters, has achieved a bumper harvest this year, transforming from a disaster area into a surplus grain area. Now, the county has formulated a plan requiring that by 1967, the yield per mu south of the irrigation canal reach 800 jin, and the yield per mu north of the canal reach 600 jin. The farmers of Siyang County, encouraged by the joy of the bumper harvest, were even more energetic when they heard the newly published program draft. The members of the Cangji Cooperative said: This year's grain yield reached 448 jin per mu, and we will strive to reach 558 jin next year, exceeding the program's provisions by 10%. By 1962, we can strive to reach 885 jin. On the day the revised program draft was published, Shangfang Township in Jiangning County drafted a water conservancy plan for 1962: the township will build 468 projects, including ponds, dams, ditches, culverts, and reservoirs, striving to increase the rice yield per mu in 1958 from the originally planned 420 jin to 455 jin, and to reach 828 jin by 1962.

　　　The publication of the revised program draft has helped to overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking in the current agricultural leadership organs and rural cadres. The branch secretaries of various townships, who were attending a meeting of the Huaiyin Prefectural Party Committee, criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking after reading the revised program draft. The water conservancy plan for this winter and next spring, which was adopted at the meeting, is much larger than the original plan formulated by the Water Conservancy Bureau in September. For example, the area of dry land converted to paddy fields increased from 560,000 mu to more than 900,000 mu. After this plan is implemented, it can increase grain production by 280 million jin next year.

　　　The broad masses of workers and staff, who are closely connected with the farmers, also expressed their confidence that they will surely shoulder the glorious tasks proposed to them in the program. The Wuxi Water Pump Factory has decided to expand its production of water pumps threefold next year. The Wuxi Cement Pipe Factory's employees are manufacturing cement pipes for a sluice gate in the Yancheng Special Zone, which was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, and they are now determined to deliver the goods one month ahead of schedule. Many employees of the Nanjing Veterinary Medicine Factory also said that they must produce large quantities of medicines to prevent swine fever and chicken plague.

　　　The revised program draft has also encouraged agricultural science workers throughout the province. Nanjing Agricultural College has planned to reconsider and revise scientific research projects and teaching materials in accordance with the requirements of the program. Subei Agricultural College will also revise the teaching materials for plant cultivation and agronomy.

　　　(Our dispatch from Nanchang, October 28) When the cadres and members of many agricultural cooperatives in Jiangxi Province saw the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) published in the newspaper, they were all overjoyed and filled with boundless confidence in the beautiful prospects of the new socialist countryside.

　　　Hu Shuigen, the deputy director of the Shatan Agricultural Cooperative in Shatan Township, Nanchang County, said: Shortly after transitioning to a senior cooperative at the end of 1955, we saw the National Agricultural Development Program draft. By working hard in accordance with the provisions of the program draft, the cooperative's production has greatly improved in the past two years. Previously, the cooperative used to have about 1,000 mu of land flooded every year. Last year, the Gangtou Sluice was built, which has basically eliminated waterlogging, and the various water conservancy projects built have enhanced the drought resistance of more than 8,000 mu of land. He said, "Things that were originally considered impossible have been achieved by working according to the spirit of the program." He expressed his determination to break with conservative thinking and achieve the requirements put forward by the National Agricultural Development Program. Chen Jieyuan, a member of the Bayi Agricultural Cooperative in Nanchang County, expressed doubt when the cooperative proposed the requirement of an average yield of 500 jin per mu in the spring of 1956, thinking that the fields were only so large, where could the production increase come from. However, when it came to harvest, it did indeed reach 500 jin. He happily said: "500 jin per mu in 1956, we can strive to reach 600 jin this year, and it is entirely possible to achieve the requirement of 800 jin proposed by the program." The cooperative members are all full of confidence in achieving the task of 800 jin per mu stipulated in the program ahead of schedule.

    农业发展纲要是指路明灯
    浙江、江苏、江西广大农民热烈展开讨论
    看清前途，看到潜力，欢欣鼓舞，劲头十足
    本报杭州28日电　全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布后，这几天，从浙南山区到杭、嘉、湖平原，从太湖流域到东海之滨的广大农村，掀起了学习农业发展纲要、执行农业发展纲要的热潮。
    在农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布这一天，浙江农村欢欣鼓舞，农业社员们奔走相告：“共产党公布了一个又富裕又幸福的纲要”。在杭、嘉、湖平原上，许多农业社把扩音器装到田间向社员传播。杭县双林乡红旗农业社社员在田间，读了刊登农业发展纲要的报纸后，立即进行了讨论。农村的报纸很少，识字的社员从广播里把农业发展纲要一字一句记下来，有些老年社员跑到很远的集镇上买一张报纸藏在怀里，说：“这不是报，是个宝，有了它，道路越走越亮堂”。
    农业发展纲要公布后，广大干部和农民对继续实现纲要四十条的规定充满信心。正在杭州参加省委四级干部会议的一千多干部，对农业发展纲要进行了热烈的讨论，大家一致认为，纲要草案执行了近两年，已引起了农村的深刻变化。平阳、诸暨、兰溪、新登、富阳、普陀等二十多个县的干部举出了许多实例，说明这两年执行纲要草案所起的巨大成效。如诸暨县执行纲要草案后，去年完成水利工程六百多万工，抗旱能力提高到四十五天至六十天以上。有了水利条件以后，这个县就大力进行生产改革，使双季稻的面积达到全县水田面积80％以上。由于增加复种指数，去年全县有三十五万亩水稻产量达到了亩产八百斤以上。
    经过学习农业发展纲要以后，许多县和农业社订了农业生产规划、行动计划和增产节约计划。诸暨县根据农业发展纲要修正草案的要求，提出今年再兴修六百万亩土方的水利工程；养猪从现在二十四万头发展到四十六万头；要求今冬基本上消灭空白田，增加复种指数。嵊泗县玉龙渔业社还开了社员大会，计划从1958年到1962年的第二个五年计划期间，社里要积累资金一百五十一万元，加上社员的投资，再增建三十艘机帆渔船，使50％的社员用机帆船生产，为过渡到渔轮生产创造条件。海宁硖石乡金里农业社讨论了农业发展纲要后，还订了六项行动计划：一、人人要学习农业发展纲要，并且要宣传纲要的好处。二、秋收冬种中要保证做到细收细打，适时播种。三、增积土肥，全社要多增加八只船挖河泥。四、今冬达到每户养猪三头。五、今冬要妥善安排好劳力和生产，让社里患血吸虫病的社员分批去治疗。六、今冬要搞好扫盲工作，把社里原有的七个民校恢复起来。
    本报南京28日电　全国农业发展纲要修正草案公布以后，得到了江苏省广大农民、工人和知识分子的热烈拥护。他们纷纷表示要用革命精神，从各方面来实现这个纲要所作的规定。
    1956年1月公布的全国农业发展纲要草案，在江苏省农村中已经起了很大的积极作用，农民们热爱地称之为“指路明灯”；现在这盏明灯再一次鼓起了农民前进的信心和决心。不少农业社已经在对照这个修正的纲要草案，重新规划今后的工作。江浦县龙华农业社社长丁长友满怀信心地说：“纲要要求我们这个地区到1967年粮食单位产量达到八百斤，我们只要把多数田改种稻、麦二熟，再把一部分旱田改成水田，三、五年后每亩收八百斤粮食是完全可能的。”
    历史上经常遭受自然灾害的滨海县，今年获得了大丰收，由灾区变成了余粮区。现在，这个县已订出了规划，要求到1967年，灌溉总渠以南每亩产量达到八百斤，以北达到六百斤。被大丰收的喜悦所鼓舞的泗阳县农民，听到新公布的纲要修正草案，更加劲头十足，仓集社社员们表示：今年粮食亩产达到四百四十八斤，明年争取达到五百五十八斤，超过纲要规定的10％，到1962年，就可以争取达到八百八十五斤。江宁县上坊乡在修正的纲要草案公布的当天，就拟订了到1962年的水利规划：全乡将兴建塘坝、水沟、涵闸、水库等四百六十八项，争取1958年水稻亩产由原订的四百二十斤，增加到四百五十五斤，到1962年，达到八百二十八斤。
    纲要修正草案的公布，帮助了克服目前农业领导机关和农村干部中的右倾保守思想。正在淮阴地委开会的各乡支部书记，在读了纲要修正草案后，批判了右倾保守思想，会议上通过的今冬明春的水利计划，要比9月份水利局原订的计划大得多。如旱地改水田的面积由五十六万亩增加到九十多万亩，这个计划实现后，明年即可增产粮食二亿八千万斤。
    和农民息息相通的广大职工群众，也满怀信心地表示：一定担负起纲要中向他们提出的光荣任务。无锡水泵厂决定要在明年把水泵的生产扩大三倍。无锡水泥管厂职工为盐城专区一座水闸制造的水泥管，原定今年年底完成，现在决心提前一月交货。南京兽医药品制造厂很多职工也表示一定要大量生产预防猪瘟、鸡瘟的药品。
    纲要修正草案也鼓舞了全省的农业科学工作者，南京农学院已计划根据纲要的要求重新考虑修改科学研究项目和教材。苏北农学院也将修改植物栽培和耕作学的教材。
    本报南昌28日电　江西省许多农业社的社干部和社员们看到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）在报上公布，无不欢欣鼓舞，对社会主义的新农村的美好远景充满无限的信心。
    南昌县沙潭乡沙潭农业社副主任胡水根说：1955年底转高级社不久，就看到全国农业发展纲要草案，按照纲要草案的规定去努力，两年来，农业社的生产已有很大的提高。以前，社里每年要淹浸千亩左右田地，去年修好了岗头闸，已基本上消灭了涝害，修建的各种水利工程，增强了八千余亩田的抗旱能力。他说：“本来认为办不到的事，按纲要的精神去作，结果都办到了”。他表示要打破保守思想，实现农业发展纲要提出的要求。南昌县八一农业社社员陈介元，在1956年春社里提出每亩产量平均达到五百斤的要求时，还表示怀疑，认为田就那么大，往哪里增产。但是，到收获的时候，果然达到了五百斤。他高兴地说：“1956年每亩五百斤，今年可争取达到六百斤，实现纲要提出的八百斤的要求是完全可能的。”这个社的社员对于提前达到纲要中规定的亩产八百斤的任务，都满怀信心。
