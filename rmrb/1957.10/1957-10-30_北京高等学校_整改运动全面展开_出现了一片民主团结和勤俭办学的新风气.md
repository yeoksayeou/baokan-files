Xinhua News Agency, 29th: A vigorous rectification campaign is underway in twenty-nine universities in the capital. In these schools, not only is the number of opinions expressed in big-character posters and forums increasing daily, but the masses and leading cadres are also working together to improve work, creating a new atmosphere of democracy, unity, and thrift in education.

By the 28th, teachers, students, and staff in these universities had put forward more than 158,000 opinions, averaging more than one per person. The Geological Exploration College, Beijing Normal University, and the University of International Trade, which launched the campaign earlier, received even more opinions from the masses. At the University of International Trade, teachers and students submitted an average of four opinions per person. Teachers who were somewhat hesitant to speak out in the first week or two frankly expressed their thoughts in big-character posters and forums this week. Professor Yu Shanchu submitted a written opinion of more than 3,000 words, criticizing and suggesting improvements to the school's organization, teaching principles, training objectives, and other aspects. He also cited facts to directly criticize a vice president's bureaucratic style. Teachers, students, and staff at the Normal University have submitted more than 30,000 opinions, with over 90% of the teachers offering suggestions, exposing the main shortcomings of the school leadership in helping intellectuals reform and cultivate talent. The focus of big-character posters by teachers and students at the Geological Exploration College has shifted from general welfare and teaching issues to streamlining the organization and running the school thriftily. Many university Party committees and administrative leaders have not only improved some aspects of welfare but also made rapid improvements to issues such as leadership style and teaching quality. Universities have generally established a system of regular meeting days between presidents, vice presidents, Party secretaries and deputy secretaries with teachers and students. The president and vice president of Peking University have already met with representatives of first-year students and teachers who have returned from capitalist countries. Leaders at Tsinghua University have listened to the opinions of more than twenty visitors in the past week. Two Party secretaries of Beijing Normal University personally attended classes in the History and Chinese Departments to understand the students' learning problems. Some other deputy Party secretaries participated in student branch activities, while others inspected catering work. The Foreign Affairs College and the University of International Trade have resolved long-standing issues such as development direction and training objectives. The Railway Institute and Beijing Medical College have solved the problem of internship bases. The staffing of Renmin University has been reduced by nearly 40%. Now, almost every teacher and staff member in the university is shouldering the work previously done by two people, and the directors and deputy directors of various departments and teaching and research sections are mostly participating in lecturing. The Law, Journalism, Agricultural Economics, and Political Economy departments have improved the content of their courses based on the opinions of teachers and students, adding systematic critiques of bourgeois legal, journalistic, and economic viewpoints, overcoming the past shortcomings of only conducting positive education.

In schools where the rectification work started earlier, the sharp criticisms from teachers, students, and staff have gradually focused on the important issues of the entire school. They not only raise problems but also discuss solutions, with some schools adopting the form of thematic discussions. The main issues discussed by teachers and staff at the Geological Exploration College, Mining College, and Petroleum Institute last week were about running the schools thriftily. At the University of International Trade, teachers and staff enthusiastically and earnestly discussed the issue of streamlining the organization on big-character posters. Each teaching and research section and each department posted the number of people currently working, the division of labor, the actual workload of each person, and the plan for streamlining the organization based on this situation.

Some schools hold meetings of teachers, students, and staff representatives to solve various problems. The student representative meeting held by the University of International Trade on the 26th discussed six issues related to running the school thriftily, such as the use of student grants and the supply of books and materials. Before the meeting, the school leaders had classified and sorted out the opinions on these issues and proposed solutions, and on the 25th, they mobilized all students to discuss the solutions. Holding representative meetings can ensure that the opinions of the masses are fully reflected through the representatives, and the problems are discussed in a focused and in-depth manner. Recently, they will also hold a meeting of teacher and staff representatives to discuss the streamlining of the organization and the issue of transferring personnel to the countryside for production. The Geological Exploration College and Normal University have also held such meetings.

Now, many teachers, students, and staff have proposed "Everyone is responsible for the rectification work." While offering opinions, they immediately start to improve the work that can be improved. After the teachers of the Biology Department of Normal University exposed and criticized the serious lack of responsibility for many experimental instruments and supplies in the department, the deputy director and teachers of the department carried out preliminary sorting on the last Sunday, repaired twenty-two microscopes, and cleaned up more than twenty specimen cabinets. Teachers and students from Renmin University and Tsinghua University have begun to take turns cleaning classrooms and offices and building the campus through voluntary labor. Students at Tsinghua University participate in road construction every day after class, and they plan to complete four 3,000-meter-long concrete roads by the end of the year. More than 800 teachers and students from the Aviation Institute participated in leveling the campus. Teachers and students at Normal University have cleared debris and clutter from an area of 130,000 square meters.

    北京高等学校
    整改运动全面展开
    出现了一片民主团结和勤俭办学的新风气
    新华社29日讯　首都二十九个高等学校正在轰轰烈烈地进行整改。在这些学校里，不仅大字报、座谈会上鸣放的意见的数量逐日激增，而且群众和领导干部一起动手改进工作，出现了一片民主团结和勤俭办学的新风气。
    到28日为止，这些高等学校的师生员工们所提出的意见已经有十五万八千多条，平均每人一条多。运动发动较早的地质勘探学院、北京师范大学、对外贸易学院等校群众提的意见更多。对外贸易学院师生平均每人提出四条意见。在前一两星期里对鸣放还有些犹豫的教师，这一星期在大字报和座谈会上畅谈了心里话，喻善初教授提出一份三千多字的意见书，对学校的机构、教学方针、培养目标等各方面问题都提出了批评和建议，并且列举事实直率地批评了一位副院长的官僚主义作风。师范大学师生员工已经提出三万多条意见，教师中90％以上都提了意见，揭露了学校领导在帮助知识分子改造和培养人材方面的主要缺点。地质勘探学院师生们的大字报的批评对象已从一般生活福利和教学问题，转向紧缩机构和勤俭办学校。许多学校的党委和行政领导不但对生活福利方面的一些问题作了改进，对领导作风、教学质量等方面的问题，也迅速地有了改进，各校普遍建立了正副校长和正副党委书记接见师生日的制度。北京大学正副校长已经接见了一年级学生代表和从资本主义国家归国的教师代表；清华大学的负责人在近一个星期里，听取了二十多个来访者的意见。北京师范大学两个党委书记并亲自去历史系、中文系听课，借以了解学生在学习中的问题。这个学校的其他几个党委副书记有的参加学生支部的活动，有的检查了伙食工作。外交学院、对外贸易学院都解决了长期没有解决的发展方向和培养目标等问题。铁道学院、北京医学院等校解决了实习基地的问题。人民大学的工作人员编制已经紧缩了将近40％，现在全校的教师、员工，几乎每人都担负了以前两个人的工作，各个系和教研室的正副主任大都参加了讲课。法律系、新闻系、农业经济系和政治经济学专业都根据师生们提出的意见，改进了课程内容，增加了系统批判资产阶级法律、新闻、经济学观点的内容，克服了过去只进行正面教育的缺点。
    在整改工作开展较早的学校，师生员工大鸣大放的锋芒已经逐渐集中在全校的重要问题上，他们不仅提出问题，而且就解决问题的办法展开了讨论，有的学校采用了专题鸣放的形式。地质勘探学院、矿业学院、石油学院等校的教师和职员在上星期鸣放的主要问题都是关于勤俭办学校方面的。对外贸易学院的教职员们对紧缩机构的问题在大字报上讨论得热烈而认真，各个教研室各个科都在大字报上公布了现有工作的人数、分工情况、每人担任的实际工作量，以及根据这个情况提出的紧缩机构的方案。
    有些学校召开师生员工代表会议来解决各种问题。对外贸易学院26日召开的学生代表会，对助学金使用、图书资料供应等有关勤俭办学校的六个问题进行了讨论。会前，学校领导曾把这方面问题的意见进行了分类整理，并提出了处理方案，25日发动全校学生讨论了解决方案。召开代表会议，可以使群众意见通过代表得到充分的反映，问题讨论得集中而深入。最近，他们还将举行教职员工代表会议讨论紧缩机构和抽调人员下乡生产的问题。地质勘探学院和师范大学也召开了这种会议。
    现在，许多学校的师生员工已提出“整改工作，人人有责”，他们一面提意见，一面把能够改进的工作立即动手改进。师范大学生物系教师在揭发批评了系内许多实验仪器和用品存在着严重的无人负责现象后，这个系的副主任和教师们在上个星期天进行了初步整理，检修了二十二架显微镜，清理了二十多个标本柜。人民大学、清华大学等学校师生都已开始轮流值日打扫教室办公室，用义务劳动修建校园。清华大学的学生下课后，每天都有人参加修筑道路，他们计划在年底以前完成四条三千公尺长的混凝土道路。航空学院有八百多师生参加平整校园。师范大学的师生们已把十三万平方公尺面积上的杂物乱堆清除干净了。
