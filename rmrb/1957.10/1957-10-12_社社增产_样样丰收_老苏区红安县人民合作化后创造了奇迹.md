　　Communes Increase Production, Everything Reaps a Bumper Harvest
　　--The People of the Old Revolutionary Base Area of Hong'an County Create a Miracle After Cooperativization
　　Jiang Yi, First Secretary of the Huanggang Prefectural Committee

　　Hong'an County, this heroic, battle-hardened old revolutionary base area, never ceased its brave struggle against the reactionary ruling class during the twenty-odd years before liberation. However, it also suffered severe slaughter and devastation by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and its agricultural productivity was greatly damaged. After liberation, the people of this old revolutionary base area, under the strong leadership and support of the Party and the government, rapidly healed their wounds and rebuilt their homes. However, in terms of the recovery of production and the improvement of living standards, it still lagged behind other regions before cooperativization. Only after realizing cooperativization did the old revolutionary base area undergo a real transformation.

　　The Hong'an County Party Committee and the broad masses, relying on the foundation of cooperativization, implemented the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership" and launched a large-scale production increase campaign. Over the past two years, the barren land has greatly changed its original appearance. By the spring of 1957, the county had built a total of 49 reservoirs, opened more than 3,000 new ponds and dikes, and also repaired existing ponds and dikes. Experimental pumping stations were built, and more than 70% of the paddy fields achieved guaranteed harvests. Due to the superiority of unified management and collective operation, the agricultural cooperatives overcame the difficulties of labor shortages and promoted double-cropping rice and single-cropping late japonica rice on more than 50,000 mu, with the average yield of rice per mu increasing from more than 300 jin to more than 800 jin. In addition to developing wasteland and improving more than 35,000 mu of soil, they also transformed more than 58,000 mu of backward land. The Party and the government also provided great assistance to the agricultural cooperatives. In recent years, in addition to providing various relief and loans of more than 400,000 yuan, the state also supplied 590 double-furrow plows, 1,523 walking plows, and 18 threshing machines, which played a significant role in promoting the development of agricultural production.

　　Cadres Personally Cultivate Experimental Plots
　　Closely Contact the Masses to Learn Production Techniques

　　In order to effectively lead agricultural production, county and district cadres went deep into agricultural cooperatives and production teams to participate in production and lead production. At the same time, they personally cultivated experimental plots to conduct technical reforms and typical demonstrations of high-yield production. Fourteen of the eighteen county committee members lived in the countryside for long periods to run the cooperatives, and each cultivated a piece of experimental plot, most of which achieved high yields. Of the 276 district cadres, 195 cultivated experimental plots; of the 490 township cadres, 324 cultivated experimental plots. The result of this was that not only did the leading cadres' participation in production and leadership of production have concrete content, but they also began to understand agricultural production knowledge, gradually changing from laymen to experts, and overcoming the bureaucratic and subjectivist leadership style. Agricultural technical cadres, through experiments, began to learn to follow the mass line and better promote agricultural techniques. This not only played a demonstrative role in high-yield production, but also promoted large-scale high-yield production. For example, Comrade Cheng Peng, Secretary of the County Party Committee, personally experimented with a piece of peanut field that yielded 800 jin per mu, driving the broad masses of cadres to experiment with and manage various crops such as peanuts, rice, and cotton for high-yield production. It is estimated that this year the county will have 17 townships, 313 cooperatives, and more than 163,800 mu of land with grain yields of 1,000 jin; 15 townships, 259 cooperatives, and more than 10,000 mu of land with peanut yields of 1,000 jin.

　　Under the leadership of the Party, the people of this old revolutionary base area engaged in arduous and selfless labor in production. They overcame various difficulties such as a shortage of labor, incomplete agricultural implements, and insufficient draft cattle to run the agricultural cooperatives well. Yangshan Township was severely devastated by the Kuomintang in the past. Before 1924, the township had 52 villages with 3,969 people. By the time of liberation, only 28 villages with 1,102 people remained, and more than 720 dan of farmland was wasteland. In the face of such serious difficulties, they established 11 agricultural cooperatives. Men and women, old and young, participated in production and worked hard to repair the Panyang River embankment, which had been prone to flooding for more than 20 years, digging out more than 90 dan of farmland from the river sand; and reclaiming 94 gullies, 22 depressions, 6 fields, and 13 embankments, totaling more than 320 dan of cultivated land. These two tasks alone increased the township's grain production by more than 1.8 million jin.

　　In the old revolutionary base area, everyone knows Xu Zhenxiu, a model family member of a revolutionary martyr, who is now 72 years old. People call her Aunt Xu. She persisted in the revolutionary struggle for 30 years. Her husband and son sacrificed themselves for the revolution, and she herself was imprisoned. After liberation, she worked even more actively, mobilizing the masses to build reservoirs, taking the lead in handing over public grain, and organizing cooperatives, never lagging behind. At the age of 68, she gloriously joined the Party and became younger. She worked wholeheartedly for the Party. She also earned more than 800 work points in the cooperative and raised two pigs. She often said, "In the past, we shed blood and sacrificed ourselves for the revolution, and now we must work even more actively to build socialism."

　　Achievements of Socialist Construction
　　Production Increases, Living Standards Improve, Culture Develops

　　The broad masses of the old revolutionary base area are building socialism with such a spirit of dauntless perseverance. This year, on the basis of the great harvest in 1956, they have achieved even greater harvests. All 732 agricultural cooperatives in the county have achieved increased production and bumper harvests in everything. Although the autumn drought was severe this year, grain production is still expected to exceed the highest historical level, with an estimated yield of 820 jin per mu, an increase of 116.5% compared to 1952, an increase of 39.8% compared to 1955, and an increase of 19.9% compared to 1956. The increase in peanut production is also very prominent, with an estimated average yield of 625 jin per mu, exceeding the planning target proposed by the provincial party committee for 1962. The total output is estimated to be 30.6 million jin, an increase of 78.6% compared to 1955 and an increase of 36.9% compared to the bumper year of 1956. Cotton is expected to have an average yield of 50 jin (seed cotton) per mu, an increase of 122.5% compared to 1955 and an increase of 56.3% compared to 1956. The estimated annual production of live pigs is 180,000 heads.

　　With the development of production, the living standards of farmers have also improved. In terms of farmers' income, the total net income from agriculture and sideline occupations in the county is estimated to be 60.72 yuan per capita based on the distribution by agricultural cooperatives, an increase of 58.74% compared to 1953, an increase of 45.3% compared to 1955, and an increase of 35.35% compared to 1956. This year, each person can retain an average of 640 jin of unprocessed grain (including increased grain).

　　With the gradual improvement of the material lives of the broad masses of farmers, cultural education and health services have also developed rapidly. When the county was first liberated, there was only one middle school and 92 primary schools. Now there are five middle schools and 503 primary schools. The number of middle and primary school students has also increased from the original 8,794 to 38,253, an increase of more than three times. In the past, Hong'an farmers could not see movies at all. Now there are three film projection teams, one professional theatrical troupe, and 113 amateur theatrical troupes in the county. Before liberation, there were no more than 30 people engaged in medical work in the county, and there were no hospitals at all. Now two hospitals (85 beds), 15 health clinics, and 19 new-style midwifery stations have been established, with 128 medical personnel. This has played a significant role in protecting the people's health and promoting production development.

　　Here, let us take a closer look at how cooperativization has changed the backward face of production in the old revolutionary base area, taking one town as an example. Qiliping, the heart of the former Hubei-Henan-Anhui Soviet area, was once fragmented and devastated by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now this area has been transformed with green hills and clear waters, presenting a completely new look. The town has a total of 513 households with more than 2,500 people and has organized one Hongping Agricultural Production Cooperative and six handicraft production cooperatives. The Hongping Agricultural Cooperative has turned wasteland into fertile land, poor land into rich land, and dry land into paddy fields. It has planted trees on barren mountains (greening a total of 2,500 mu), turning poor mountains into rich mountains. In 1955, 158 households were short of grain, requiring the supply of 200,000 jin of grain annually, and 26 households needed government relief. After cooperativization, grain production increased, and all farmers became surplus grain households. This year, they can also sell more than 3,000 jin of surplus grain, and no one needs relief anymore. The cooperative has five elderly and childless households (13 people in total) who enjoy the "five guarantees" treatment, with each household receiving a subsidy of 58 yuan per year, allowing them to eat well and dress warmly. For example, the Geng family (family of a revolutionary martyr), a "five guarantees" household, has two children. Before cooperativization, although they received relief, their lives were still difficult. Now their income is 60 yuan, and not only is their life better than before, but they have also built a new house and bought cotton clothes and rubber shoes. They are happy and full of joy, saying, "In the past, we were sallow and haggard, with worried faces. Now we are radiant and full of smiles." Fang Zhonghua, a family member of a revolutionary martyr, had always left his hometown before liberation, and three people lived outside. After liberation, he returned to his hometown. In 1956, he joined the cooperative, sent his younger brother to middle school, sent his younger sister to primary school, and married a wife, rebuilding his home. He said, "The People's Liberation Army sent me back to my hometown, and cooperativization led me to happiness."

　　A middle school, a primary school, and two literacy classes have been established in the town. In the past, only more than 50 people were literate. Now there are 19 middle school students, 125 primary school students, and 94 literacy class students. There is also a theatrical troupe and a club. Film projection teams often come to show movies. There is also a hospital in the town. Smallpox has been eradicated, all deliveries are conducted using the new method, and drinking water is disinfected.

　　The members of the Hongping Cooperative cherish the happy life they have obtained through their long years of bloodshed and sacrifice. They know that without the country and without the cooperative, there can be no beautiful home. Therefore, they cherish the agricultural cooperative as they cherish their own homes and support national construction. At present, although their lives are not wealthy, they are actively contributing their efforts and funds to build the agricultural cooperative in order to increase public accumulation. This year, the cooperative purchased eight new draft cattle, eight double-furrow plows, nine seven-inch walking plows, one nail-toothed harrow, three sprayers, one water pump, and one threshing machine. Eighty-six cooperative members have savings of more than 2,000 yuan. Last year, the original task of purchasing 70 yuan of government bonds was completed at 200 yuan (the excess was returned); the public grain is always completed the fastest. In 1955, 37,000 jin of peanuts were sold. In 1957, more than 48,000 jin can be sold. If it were not for the drought, even more could have been sold this year.

　　Build Cooperatives Diligently and Frugally, Manage Households Diligently and Frugally
　　Continue to Carry Forward the Revolutionary Fine Tradition

　　In this old revolutionary base area that has experienced a long period of arduous struggle, most people still maintain and carry forward the past revolutionary fine tradition, which is especially manifested in running cooperatives diligently and frugally and managing households diligently and frugally. For example, in Kaihuang Township in the mountains, the enemy burned and killed everything before liberation, and there were no people within a radius of 40 li. After liberation, 716 people gradually moved back from outside, rebuilt 63 villages, built 896 houses, and reclaimed 1,200 mu of land. After cooperativization, the township established five agricultural cooperatives, which achieved two years of bumper harvests. Among them, the Tiantai Agricultural Cooperative, with a total of 47 cooperative members, had only four draft cattle, and 15 plows, harrows, and cultivators when it was established. Wasteland was reclaimed with hoes, and plowing was done by people pulling. Later, they accumulated some money and bought seven cows. Soon, the 20 calves born by the cows were all trained into draft cattle. Lacking agricultural implements, the cooperative's carpenters went up the mountains to cut wood and make agricultural implements. The cooperative collected scrap iron from the cooperative members, burned charcoal for fuel, and the cooperative's blacksmiths made iron tools. Fertilizer was never used for a penny. It was entirely self-accumulated manure, cut green manure, and purchased fertilizer from cooperative members' families. Management fees were only eight yuan a year. The cooperative burned pine resin for lighting and walking. At the same time, the cooperative accumulated public property of 400 yuan. The Tiantai Cooperative members ran the agricultural cooperative well with this spirit of hard struggle. Now, Kaihuang Township has also established four primary schools, a supply and marketing cooperative branch, and a medical team. Yu Yaoshuan, a 78-year-old family member of a revolutionary martyr, said to people, "After cooperativization, we truly lived in Tiantai."

　　The people of the old revolutionary base area are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. They look forward to a brighter future. Under the guidance of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), the county has summarized this year's experience in increasing production and formulated a long-term plan from 1958 to 1962. The plan requires that by 1962, the yield of paddy fields per mu will reach 1,000 jin, and the total output will reach 410 million jin, an increase of 35.2% compared to 1957. The yield of peanuts per mu will reach 900 jin, and the total output will reach 41.5 million jin, an increase of 32% compared to 1957. The yield of cotton per mu will reach 100 jin, an increase of 100% compared to 1957. The annual output of live pigs will reach 300,000 heads, an increase of 111.3% compared to 1957. It is also required that by 1962, all barren mountains will be greened, and more than 4 million mu of various economic forests will be cultivated. All ponds and dikes will be used for fish farming, with an annual output of 10 million jin of fresh fish. After the implementation of this long-term plan, the average net income per agricultural person in the county will increase from 60.72 yuan in 1957 to 90 yuan in 1962. At that time, the cooperative will be more consolidated, and the lives of farmers will be better.

　　社社增产　样样丰收
　　——老苏区红安县人民合作化后创造了奇迹
　　黄冈地委第一书记　姜一
    红安县，这个英雄的、身经百战的老苏区，在解放前二十多年当中，从未停止过对反动统治阶级的英勇的斗争。但是同时它也遭受到国民党反动派的严重屠杀和摧残，农业生产力受到极大的破坏。解放后，这个老苏区的人民在党和政府的大力领导和扶持下，迅速医治了创伤，重建了家园。但在生产的恢复和生活的提高上，合作化前仍然赶不上其他地区的水平，只是在实现了合作化以后，老苏区的面貌才有了真正的改变。
    红安县委和广大群众依靠着合作化的基础，贯彻执行“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，开展了大规模的增产运动。两年来，使瘠薄的田地大大改变了原来的面貌。到1957年春，全县共兴修水库四十九座，新开塘堰三千多口，旧有塘堰也进行了整修，试建了抽水机站，70％以上的水田达到了保收。由于统一管理、集体经营的优越性，农业社克服了劳动力的困难，推广了双季稻和一季晚粳五万余亩，水稻每亩平均产量由原来的三百多斤提高到八百多斤。不仅开发了荒田，改良土壤三万五千余亩，还改造落后田五万八千余亩。党和政府对农业社也给了很大的帮助。几年来，国家除给了各种救济、贷款四十余万元外，还供应了五百九十部双铧犁，一千五百二十三部步犁，十八台脱粒机，这些，对于促进农业生产的发展，起了重大的作用。
    干部亲手耕耘试验田
    密切联系群众学会生产技术
    为了切实领导好农业生产，县区干部深入农业社和生产队，参加生产，领导生产，同时，并亲手培养试验田，进行技术改革和高额丰产的典型示范。十八个县委委员有十四个委员长期住农村办社，每人搞了一块试验田，多数获得了丰产。二百七十六名区干部中，有一百九十五名培养了试验田；四百九十名乡干部中，有三百二十四名培植了试验田。这样作的结果，不仅使领导干部参加生产领导生产有了具体内容，也开始懂得农业生产知识，逐渐由外行变成了内行，克服了官僚主义和主观主义的领导作风。农业技术干部通过试验，开始学会走群众路线，更好地推广了农业技术。这样不仅起了高额丰产的示范作用，而且推动了大面积的丰产。如县委书记程鹏同志亲自试验了一块花生地，亩产八百斤，带动了广大干部对花生、水稻、棉花各种作物的高额丰产的试验管理。预计今年全县将有粮食千斤乡十七个、千斤社三百一十三个、千斤亩十六万三千八百多亩；有花生千斤乡十五个、千斤社二百五十九个、千斤亩一万多亩。
    这个老苏区的人民在党的领导下，在生产上进行了艰苦的忘我的劳动，他们克服了劳力少、农具不全、耕牛不足的各种困难，办好了农业社。杨山乡过去曾受国民党的严重摧残，1924年前，全乡有五十二个垸子，三千九百六十九人，到解放时，只剩下二十八个垸子，一千一百零二人，荒田七百二十多石。在这样严重困难的情况下，他们办了十一个农业社，男女动手，老少出勤，奋力修复了二十多年来常遭水患的潘阳河堤，从河沙里扒出了九十多石田地；开垦了九十四个冲、二十二个凹、六个畈、十三个塝，共计修整了三百二十多石田。仅仅这两项工作，就使全乡增产粮食一百八十多万斤。
    在老苏区，人人都晓得现年七十二岁的烈属模范徐贞秀，人们称她为徐大妈，她坚持革命斗争三十年，丈夫、儿子都为革命牺牲了，她自己也坐过牢。解放后，她更积极工作，发动群众修水库，带头交公粮，组织合作社，从未落人后。到六十八岁时，她光荣地参加了党，变得年青了，她全心全意地为党工作。她还在社内做了八百多工分，并喂养了二头猪。她常常说：“过去流血牺牲还革命，现在建设社会主义更得积极工作。”
    社会主义建设的成果
    生产增长生活改善文化发展
    老苏区的广大群众，就是以这样大无畏的坚韧不拔的精神来建设社会主义。今年，他们在1956年大丰收的基础上，又取得了更大丰收，全县七百三十二个农业社做到了社社增产、样样丰收。今年虽然秋旱严重，但是粮食产量仍可超过历史上的最高水平，预计亩产八百二十斤，比1952年增加116.5％。比1955年增加39.8％，比1956年增加19.9％。花生的增产也很突出，预计平均亩产六百二十五斤，超过省委提出的1962年的规划指标，总产量预计为三千零六十万斤，比1955年增产78.6％，比丰产的1956年增产36.9％。棉花预计平均亩产五十斤（皮棉），比1955年增产122.5％，比1956年增产56.3％。生猪预计全年生产量为十八万头。
    随着生产的发展，农民的生活水平也得到了改善。从农民的收入情况看，今年全县农副业纯收入按农业社分配，预计每人平均为六十点七二元，比1953年增加58.74％，比1955年增加45.3％，比1956年增加35.35％。今年每人平均可留原粮六百四十斤（包括增产粮）。
    随着广大农民物质生活的逐步提高，文化教育及卫生事业也得到迅速发展。全县刚解放只有一所中学和九十二所小学，现在有五所中学和五百零三所小学，中、小学生也由原来的八千七百九十四名增加到三万八千二百五十三名，即增加了三倍多。过去红安农民根本看不到电影，现在全县已有三个电影队，有一个职业剧团和一百一十三个业余剧团。解放前，全县从事医务工作的人员也不过三十多人，根本没有卫生院；现在已经建立了两个卫生院（八十五张病床），十五个卫生所，十九个新法接生站，医务人员达一百二十八人，这对于保护人民身体健康，促进生产发展，起了很大作用。
    这里，让我们再从一个镇来具体看看合作化怎样改变了老苏区生产落后的面貌。过去的鄂豫皖苏区的心脏——七里坪，曾经被国民党反动派破坏得支离破碎，一片惨景。现在这一带已是青山绿水，面貌一新。全镇共五百一十三户、二千五百多人，共组织了一个红坪农业生产合作社、六个手工业生产合作社。红坪农业社把荒地变成良田，瘦田变成肥田，旱地改为水田，在荒山栽上了树
  （共绿化了二千五百亩），把穷山变成了富山。1955年有一百五十八户缺粮，每年要供应二十万斤粮食，有二十六户需要政府救济。合作化以后，粮食增产了，全体农民都变成余粮户，今年还可卖出三千多斤余粮，再没有人要救济了。这个社有五户孤老（共十三人）享受了“五保”待遇，每户每年补助五十八元，吃得饱，穿得暖。如“五保”户耿氏（烈属），有两个孩子，合作化前虽有救济，但生活仍有困难，现在收入六十元，不仅生活比前好了，还修了新房子，买了棉衣和胶鞋。他们生活改善，喜气洋洋，他们说：“过去面黄肌瘦，愁眉苦脸，现在人面桃花，满面春风。”烈属方忠华，解放前一向离乡背井，三人在外地讨生活，解放后回乡，1956年入了社，把弟弟送入了中学，妹妹送入了小学，自己娶了妻子，重建了家园。他说：“解放军送我回了乡，合作化引导我走向了幸福。”
    镇上设立了一所中学、一所小学、两所民校。过去只有五十多人识字，现在有中学生十九人，小学生一百二十五人，民校学员九十四人。这里还有一个剧团、一个俱乐部。电影队常来放映。镇上还有一个卫生院。目前已经消灭了天花病，全部新法接生，实行了饮水消毒。
    红坪社的社员们非常珍视经过自己长期流血牺牲得来的幸福生活；他们知道没有国、没有社，便不可能有美好的家，因此，他们像爱护自己的家一样爱护农业社，支援国家建设。目前，他们的生活虽然并不富裕，但是却在积极地出力出资建设农业社，以增加公共积累。今年全社新买耕牛八头、双铧犁八部、七寸步犁九部、钉齿钯一个、喷雾器三部、抽水机一部、打谷机一部。八十六户社员存款二千余元。去年原订购买公债任务七十元，结果完成二百元（多购的又退回了）；公粮年年完成最快。1955年卖花生三万七千斤，1957年可卖四万八千多斤，要不是遭受了旱灾，今年可以卖得更多。
    勤俭建社勤俭持家
    继续发扬革命优良传统
    在这个经历过长期艰苦斗争的老苏区，今天大多数人仍然保持着并且发扬着过去革命的优良传统，这点特别表现在勤俭办社和勤俭持家上面。如在大山中的开荒乡，解放前曾被敌人烧杀一光，方圆四十里地，人烟绝迹。解放后，陆续从外面迁回的有七百一十六人，重建了六十三个村垸，盖了八百九十六间房屋，开垦了一千二百亩地。全乡在合作化后办起了五个农业社，获得了两年丰收。其中天台农业社，共四十七户社员，在建社时仅有耕牛四头，犁、耙、耖共十五件，开荒用锄头挖，犁地用人拉。后来积下点钱购买了七头母牛，不久又把母牛生下的二十头小牛，全部训练成耕牛。缺少农具，社里的木匠就上山伐木做农具。合作社收集社员的废铁，自己烧炭做燃料，社员铁匠自己打铁器做农具。肥料从来没有用过一分钱，完全是自己积大粪，割绿肥，买社员家庭的肥料。管理费一年只用八元钱，社里点灯和走路，都是烧的松树脂。同时，社里还积累了公共财产四百元。天台社的社员们就是以这种艰苦奋斗的精神，办好了农业社。现在，开荒乡还办了四所小学，设了一个供销社分店，一个医疗组。七十八岁的烈属余耀拴对人说，“合作化以后，我们才真正住上了天台。”
    老苏区人民并没有满足目前已有的成就，他们盼望着更加美好的未来。在全国农业发展纲要（草案）的指导下，全县总结了今年增产经验，制定了从1958年到1962年的远景规划。规划要求：粮食到1962年每亩水田产量达到一千斤，总产量达到四亿一千万斤，比1957年增产35.2％。花生每亩产量达到九百斤，总产量达到四千一百五十万斤，比1957年增产32％。棉花亩产一百斤，比1957年增产一倍。生猪达到年产量三十万头，比1957年增加111.3％。还要求到1962年绿化全部荒山，营造各种经济林四百余万亩。全部塘堰养鱼，达到年产一千万斤鲜鱼。这个长远规划实现以后，全县每年每个农业人口的平均纯收入将由1957年的六十元七角二分，增加到1962年的九十元，那时合作社更加巩固了，农民生活会更好。
