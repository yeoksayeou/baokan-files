Shenyang Screw Factory Streamlines Organization
Nearly Half of Management Cadres Transferred to Workshops; Existing Eighteen Sections to be Merged into Eight Sections

(Our Dispatch) The Shenyang Screw Factory recently finalized a plan to streamline its enterprise management structure. According to this plan, the factory plans to transfer more than 200 of its 500-plus management cadres to strengthen the workshops, representing nearly one-half of the factory's management personnel.

During the period of the great airing of views (Da Ming Da Fang), the factory leadership creatively adopted a method of airing views by specialty, convening five professional personnel座谈会 (zaotan hui, or discussion meetings) successively for technology, planning, production, finance, and labor wages. This allowed many problems existing in the factory to be categorized and addressed by the collective strength of the masses. For example, labor wage workers Xia Jingxian and Feng Baohua from the countersunk bolt workshop proposed the merger of the countersunk bolt workshop and the countersunk nut workshop. These two workshops originally constituted one workshop producing the same type of products, but they were divided into two workshops in 1956. The number of workers did not increase, but the number of management personnel increased from more than 30 to more than 60. Therefore, they suggested merging these two workshops again, which could save half of the management personnel. Others raised opinions about the duplication of work in many departments. After studying and summarizing these opinions from the masses, the factory leadership promptly determined a plan to streamline the organization. According to this plan, the factory's existing eighteen sections and one office will be streamlined into eight sections and one office. The existing eight workshops will also be merged into seven workshops.

    沈阳螺钉厂紧缩机构
    抽调管理干部近半下放到车间  现有十八个科将合并成八个科
    本报讯　沈阳螺钉厂最近确定了紧缩企业管理机构的方案。根据这个方案，该厂从五百多名管理干部中准备抽调二百多名充实到车间去，下放人数占这个工厂的管理干部的近二分之一。
    这个工厂的领导方面在大鸣大放期间，创造了按专业鸣放办法，先后召开了技术、计划、生产、财务、劳动工资等五个专业人员座谈会，把工厂中存在的许多问题按类集中起来，并开始通过群众力量想法解决。例如车间劳动工资员夏景贤、冯宝华等提出毛螺栓车间和毛螺母车间合并问题。这两个车间本来是生产性质相同的一个车间，但在1956年却被分成了两个车间，工人并没增加，而管理人员却从三十多名增加到六十多名，因此他们都建议再将这两个车间合并，可以节省一半管理人员。还有人提出许多科室工作重复等意见。工厂领导方面研究和归纳了群众的这些意见以后，及时确定了紧缩机构的方案，根据这个方案，该厂现有的十八个科一个室，将紧缩成八个科一个室，现有的八个车间，也将并成七个车间。
