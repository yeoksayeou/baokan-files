    Warsaw Dispatch: Polish security organs have recently arrested several foreign spies.
    Jozef Binkowski was a spy employed by British intelligence. In June of this year, he illegally crossed the border and fled to West Berlin. There, British intelligence recruited him and soon sent him back to Poland, with the task of collecting information on the distribution of Polish troops and the operation of trucks passing through Poland. In addition, security organs arrested Ya. Putrevich, a telegraph typist in a company in Szczecin, and So. Latajczyk, a scientific worker in Poznan. They both joined anti-Polish espionage work in France before returning to the country. A lot of incriminating evidence was found during the arrest.
