　　Random Recollections of a Visit to the Soviet Union
　　Zhou Xinfang
　　Last year, the comrades of the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe and I visited Moscow, the capital of our great ally the Soviet Union, on the eve of the 39th anniversary of the October Revolution.

　　Comrade Galyanov, Deputy Director of the Touring Performance Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Culture, raised his glass at our first luncheon together and said, "Your arrival in Moscow on the eve of the October Revolution Day is of even greater significance, because, in our view, your visit and performance are no different from our own performance. And our great festival is also your festival."

　　In fact, this great festival belongs to the working people of the whole world. We deeply felt this on the reviewing stand in Red Square. Below the stand were endless, surging waves of Soviet troops and workers and peasants, displaying invincible power. On the stand, it was like an international family: French youths and Egyptian travelers hugged tightly, an old Indian lady chatted warmly with members of Soviet ethnic minorities, and our comrades surrounded Mrs. Fučík, the wife of the great Czechoslovak revolutionary martyr, asking questions… The marching masses constantly waved the flags and flowers in their hands towards the reviewing stand, and the spectators on the stand responded with enthusiastic applause and cheers. When the advancing masses discovered a row of seventy or eighty Chinese guests standing on the seventh reviewing stand, the songs of "Moscow-Beijing" and the slogans "Long live the Chinese people" and "Long live the People's Republic of China" immediately intertwined and rushed towards us. At that moment, everyone would feel from the bottom of their hearts that the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the solidarity and cooperation of the peace-loving working people of the world have formed an unparalleled powerful force that will make the imperialists and their lackeys tremble!

　　As soon as we arrived in Leningrad, we visited the cruiser "Aurora" docked on the Neva River, which fired the first shot against the enemies of the proletariat in the October Socialist Revolution; then, when we visited the Winter Palace Museum, we personally entered the Emerald Palace where the bourgeois provisional government surrendered. Standing in this sacred place of revolution, one cannot help but feel deeply moved: The October Revolution, which opened a new era in human history, happened right here!

　　In Leningrad, we also braved the snow and trudged thirty-three kilometers to visit the "Lenin's Hut" in Razliv, where Comrade Lenin took refuge on the eve of the October Revolution. The great revolutionary teacher Lenin hid in this desolate forest and personally directed the revolutionary movement. In those difficult years, he also wrote the classic work "State and Revolution" on a tree stump.

　　In Riga, the capital of Latvia, we met with Ostrov, the Minister of Culture of Latvia. He is an old Bolshevik. Before and after the October Revolution, he served as a company commander in the Red Army. He repeatedly told us that there was a Chinese platoon in his company, and he had fought side by side with outstanding Chinese worker brothers; he said that this fact showed that China and Latvia had a fighting friendship long ago. He was deeply proud of this friendship.

　　Lebedev, Chairman of the Gomel Soviet in Belarus, also excitedly and happily told us a historical fact: During the October Revolution, there was a Chinese battalion in the international regiment stationed in Gomel; this battalion joined hands with the Soviet Red Army in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. While accompanying us on a tour of the city, he also pointed to the ruins of a building near our hotel that was destroyed in the Great Patriotic War and said to us, "The Chinese battalion fought here back then."

　　Although the performance tasks were quite busy, we always tried to squeeze out time to visit some of the major local industrial production units whenever we went to a republic or a city. Every visit gave us a deep impression: The October Revolution has been victorious for nearly forty years, but the Soviet government is still adhering to the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift. The Minsk Automobile Plant we visited is a large-scale heavy industrial enterprise with amazing productivity. One type of self-loading and unloading giant truck that it often produces has a load capacity of twenty-five tons, and one tire alone is as tall as a person. Another larger self-loading and unloading truck, with a load capacity of forty tons, had already been designed when we visited, and it was expected to be put into production in the first quarter of this year, which means that when we are now enthusiastically celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, this super-heavy transport vehicle like a behemoth has already been manufactured in large quantities from the Minsk Automobile Plant and sent to various important cities and construction sites at home and abroad.

　　What is particularly touching is that despite the astonishing development of production efficiency and product quality, the factory buildings and equipment are so simple and unadorned that, purely from the appearance, no one would think that such products are produced in such a factory. What is even more touching is that when the Soviet government has transferred a large amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support our country and other people's democratic countries in carrying out socialist construction, it itself is painstakingly using relatively old factory buildings and equipment. My comrades and I have visited the brand-new First Automobile Manufacturing Plant built with Soviet assistance in China, and comparing the two, we cannot help but be deeply moved. We must not only learn from the Soviet Union's traditional virtues of building the country with diligence and thrift, but also learn from their great internationalist spirit of selflessness and helping others.

　　Minsk, the capital of Belarus, was almost completely razed to the ground by the inhumane German invaders during the Great Patriotic War. But when we visited Minsk, we saw a broad, clean, and magnificent modern city. In the short ten years after the war, the Belarusian Party and government led the entire people to quickly rebuild their beloved hometown and capital on the ruins. The rebuilt new city is more complete, more splendid, and more magnificent than the old city. Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, also encountered a similar fate to Minsk. When the Ukrainian people rebuilt their capital, they not only had to build quickly and well, but also had to completely restore the original layout and style. This fully demonstrates the incomparably powerful strength of the working people who are masters of their own affairs, and it also fully demonstrates the incomparably superior nature of the socialist system.

    访苏杂忆
    周信芳
      去年，我和上海京剧院访苏演出团的同志们，在十月革命三十九周年纪念节日的前夕，去到我们伟大盟邦苏联的首都莫斯科。
    苏联文化部巡回演出局副局长加辽伊诺夫同志，在和我们第一次共进午餐时就举杯说：“你们在十月革命节的前夕来到莫斯科，意义就更其重大；因为，你们的访问演出，在我们看来，无异于我们自己的演出。而我们的伟大的节日也就是你们的节日。”
    实际上，这个伟大的节日是属于全世界劳动人民的。在红场观礼台上，我们深深感受到这一点。台下，是连绵不断、浪潮汹涌般的，显示了无敌的威力的苏军部队和工农群众的行列。台上，宛如国际大家庭：法国青年和埃及旅客紧紧拥抱，印度老太太和苏联少数民族亲切地絮话，我们团的同志们则把捷克斯洛伐克伟大革命先烈伏契克的夫人包围起来问长问短……游行群众不断把手中举着的旗帜和鲜花向着观礼台挥舞，台上的观礼者则拚命报以热烈的掌声和欢呼。当大踏步前进的群众发见第七号观礼台上成排地站着七十几个中国宾客时，“莫斯科—北京”的歌声，“中国人民万岁”、“中华人民共和国万岁”的口号，立刻交织着向我们袭来。这时，无论谁都会从心底深处感到：中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊、以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，以及全世界爱好和平的劳动人民的团结合作，已经形成一种无与伦比的强大力量，它将使帝国主义者及其走卒们发抖！
    一到列宁格勒，我们就参观了停泊在尼瓦河边的、在十月社会主义革命中向无产阶级的敌人发出第一炮的“阿芙乐尔”号巡洋舰；接着我们又在参观冬宫博物馆的时候，亲身走进资产阶级临时政府在里面受降的那座翡翠宫。置身在这革命圣地里，人们不能不感慨万千：开辟了人类历史的新纪元的十月革命，不是在别处，就是在这里啊！
    在列宁格勒，我们还冒雪跋涉三十三公里，参观了十月革命前夕列宁同志避难的拉兹里夫“列宁草棚”。伟大的革命导师列宁，就是隐蔽在这荒芜的森林里，亲自指挥革命运动的。在那样艰苦的岁月里，他还伏在树墩上写作了“国家与革命”这本经典著作。
    在拉脱维亚首都里加，我们会见了拉脱维亚文化部部长奥斯特洛夫。这是一个老布尔什维克。十月革命前后，他担任红军的连长。他反复地告诉我们：在他那个连里，有一个排是中国排，他曾和中国的优秀的工人弟兄并肩作战；他说，从这一事实，说明中国和拉脱维亚早就有了战斗的友谊。他深为这友谊而骄傲。
    白俄罗斯高美里市苏维埃主席列别节夫也兴奋愉快地告诉我们一件史实：十月革命时，驻扎在高美里市的国际团中有一个中国营；这个营在镇压反革命分子暴动的战斗中，曾经和苏联红军携手共进。在陪同我们参观市容时，他还指着我们旅馆附近的一座毁于卫国战争中的大厦的残骸，向我们说：“当年，中国营就是在这里进行战斗的。”
    虽然演出任务相当忙碌，但每到一个加盟共和国和一个城市，我们总尽量挤出时间来参观访问一些当地主要的工业生产单位。每次参观访问，总得到一个深刻的印象：十月革命胜利已经近四十年了，但苏联政府还在坚持勤俭建国的方针。我们参观过的明斯克汽车制造厂，是一个规模相当宏大、生产力十分惊人的重工业企业。它经常生产的一种自动装卸巨型卡车，载重二十五吨，光是一只车轮，就和我们人一般高。另外一种更大的自动装卸卡车，载重四十吨，我们参观时已经设计完成，预计今年第一季度就能投入生产，也就是说，当我们现在热烈庆祝十月革命四十周年的时候，这种巨毋霸似的超重运输工具早已大量从明斯克汽车制造厂制造出来，一批批地分别送往国内外的各个重要城市和工地去了。
    特别使人感动的是：尽管生产效率和产品质量发展到了惊人的高度，但是厂房和设备却是那么朴实无华，如果单纯从外表来看，谁也不会想到这样的产品是从那样的工厂里生产出来的。更使人感动的是：当苏联政府抽调了大量的人力、物力、财力来支援我国以及各个人民民主国家进行社会主义建设时，它自己却刻苦地使用着比较陈旧的厂房和设备。我和我的同志们在国内大都访问过苏联帮助我们建设的崭新的第一汽车制造厂，把两者对比一下，就不由得不深受感动。我们不仅要学苏联的勤俭建国的传统美德，而且要学他们的克己助人的伟大国际主义精神。
    白俄罗斯首都明斯克，在卫国战争中，几乎全部被灭绝人性的德寇夷为平地。但当我们参观明斯克市容时，眼前却是一座宽阔、整洁、壮观的现代化都市。在战后短短十年间，白俄罗斯的党和政府领导着全体人民在瓦砾堆上把自己热爱的家乡和首都迅速地重建起来。重建起来的这个新都市，比旧城更完整，更辉煌，更雄伟。乌克兰的首都基辅，也遭遇到和明斯克相似的命运。乌克兰人民在重建他们的首都时，不仅要盖得快，盖得好，而且要完全恢复原来的格局和式样。从这里充分显示了当家作主的劳动人民的无比强大的力量，从这里也充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
