    In Xuanhua County, No Household Has Withdrawn from the Cooperative in the Last Two Years
    By Our Correspondent Lin Wei
    A vigorous seedling will sprout even from a crack in the rock. The agricultural cooperative, representing a new productive force, nurtured by the Party and the People's Government, will certainly grow and develop continuously and consolidate step by step, provided it has correct leadership. The fact that no household has withdrawn from the agricultural cooperatives in Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, in the two years since cooperativization fully illustrates this law.
    Not only has no household withdrawn, but more than 40 households applied to join the cooperative this spring. Last year, there were more than 60 individual farmers in the county, and now there are only 20 left.
    In order to find out the reasons why no household has withdrawn from the agricultural cooperatives in Xuanhua County in the past two years, the reporter recently visited the Xuanhua County Party Committee and other comrades in Xuanhua County who were involved in running the cooperatives. According to various sources, the county has made great achievements in developing production in the two years since cooperativization. In order to increase agricultural production, they carried out large-scale water conservancy projects throughout the county, digging 463 wells, opening 246 canals, and building seven reservoirs, increasing the irrigated area by 85,294 mu. This number is equivalent to 55.3% of the total irrigated area in the county before liberation. They implemented many measures such as damming gullies to build land in the mountainous areas to conserve water and soil, effectively controlling more than 300 square kilometers of soil and water loss. The upsurge of manure accumulation in the spring of 1956 tapped various sources of fertilizer; coupled with the rapid development of pig farming, the amount of fertilizer applied to most of the cultivated land in the county has increased significantly in the past two years. In addition, there were measures such as increasing the planting of high-yield crops (corn, etc.), rational close planting, intercropping, and interplanting. These measures enabled the county to maintain a relatively high yield (145 jin) last year despite severe natural disasters such as wind, hail, frost, and freezing. Seventy-two of the county's 97 cooperatives increased production (the remaining 25 cooperatives reduced production due to disasters). In terms of sideline occupations, there has also been considerable development since the second half of last year. Added together with the first half of this year, the total income from sideline occupations reached more than 3.65 million yuan. With a population of 230,000 in the county, the average income per person was more than 15 yuan. The development of forestry and animal husbandry has also brought many benefits to the farmers. The development of production in various fields has generally increased the income of cooperative members. According to statistics, there are 43 cooperatives in the county where more than 90% of the members increased their income, 20 cooperatives where more than 80% of the members increased their income, and 9 cooperatives where more than 70% of the members increased their income. In the past, very few farmers' families had coal stoves, but now many do; young people and women wearing foreign cloth and twill fabric are no longer considered well-dressed, and many people have started to wear khaki fabric; leather jackets, woolen sweaters, felt hats, floral shirts, enamel basins, thermos bottles, flashlights... have increased dramatically in the past two years. Comparing the current life with the past, most farmers feel that cooperativization has many benefits. This is the relatively solid material foundation for the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives in Xuanhua County.
    Of course, relying solely on the material foundation is not enough to consolidate the cooperatives. In order to consolidate the cooperatives, the county also pays great attention to ideological and political work among the broad masses.
    Ideological and political leadership is of course inseparable from specific business leadership at various stages, that is, the leadership of production and construction. In order to increase agricultural production and develop the mountainous economy, the Xuanhua County Party Committee has devoted all its efforts to leading agricultural activities in various seasons, helping the cooperatives to overcome difficulties in terms of funds, livestock, fertilizers, and feed, and organizing large-scale soil and water conservation work and forestry and animal husbandry activities. These are all very important and indispensable. However, without the other aspect, namely ideological and political work, the agricultural cooperatives here would never have been as consolidated as they are today.
    In February and March 1956, when the countryside began to achieve comprehensive cooperativization, the peasant masses and even many grassroots cooperative cadres had some confused ideas. They only knew that socialism was a very happy life, but they did not know that there was still a very difficult road to achieve this happy life, and they had to pay very hard work. They stared at the state, hoping that the state would grant loans, grant machines, grant electric lights and telephones... When working, many cooperative members saw that the cooperative's system was not perfect, not strict, or had unreasonable places, and did not actively suggest improvements with the attitude of being masters of their own affairs. Instead, they used various methods to exploit loopholes, only caring about earning work points, regardless of quality, regardless of the impact on production. Ordinary honest cooperative members saw that this was not right, but they had no way to do anything, and their work became sloppy. What about the cadres? They were full of blind optimism, as if they thought that since cooperativization had been achieved, production would increase no matter what. Some people only pursued the form of an eight-hour work system, going to work and getting off work, but paid little attention to real measures to increase production and build the mountainous areas. If things continued like this, of course things would be ruined. In response to this situation, the County Party Committee promptly organized a large-scale propaganda and education campaign in February and March, with the central slogan "Labor Creates Happiness," explaining that happiness cannot be obtained out of thin air, but must rely on one's own hands to build water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizers, cultivate intensively, and improve the land in order to increase agricultural production; it is necessary to make full use of mountainous areas to develop forestry and animal husbandry... The County Party Committee members and many cadres in the county went everywhere to make reports to cooperative members and the masses, organizing everyone to discuss. The movement was widely carried out, and a new atmosphere of hard work replaced the original bad atmosphere: the going-to-work and getting-off-work system was abolished, the phenomenon of doing work regardless of quality was greatly reduced, and the atmosphere of actively building mountainous areas and establishing a family business became strong. Many villages relying on the mountains organized manpower to go into the mountain valleys to plant trees, raise sheep, raise chickens, and raise rabbits. Some villages began to build fish-scale pits on the hillsides in large quantities, and some built large reservoirs or dammed gullies to build land... This movement made people understand some fundamental issues ideologically, and at the same time promoted various production and construction activities, which played a good role in consolidating the agricultural cooperatives.
    Last year, the county advocated planting more corn (a high-yield crop), increasing it from more than 60,000 mu in the previous year to 320,000 mu. The masses were a little unaccustomed to it (the masses here do not like to eat corn very much); and some cooperatives, regardless of geological conditions, fertilizers, and other conditions, planted too densely and did not do a good job in topdressing and weeding, resulting in a partial reduction in income. In the autumn, some landlords, rich peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants took advantage of the dissatisfaction of some of the masses and clamored that the cooperatives had no superiority and had been run badly. Some demanded that the Party and the government should not manage production in the future, but only ask the cooperatives for how much public grain they wanted. The local newspapers did not fully consider the fact that the cooperatives lacked experience in the first year of operation and criticized the local bureaucracy and subjectivism in one breath. This one-sided criticism fueled the flames, making the atmosphere even more tense. From the second half of October, the County Party Committee organized another county-wide discussion, with the theme of "Has it been run well or badly after all?" and "Do cooperatives have superiority?". According to the proposal of the County Party Committee, the cooperatives calculated accounts, laid out the facts, and reasoned. The result of the accounting was that 72 of the county's 97 cooperatives (large cooperatives) had increased production, and the lives of the members had also improved. Only 25 cooperatives reduced production, but the main reason was natural disasters. Some cooperatives only had a reduction in production in individual production teams (natural villages), and the reason was that the field work was done too badly. For example, in one team of the Songjiazhuang Cooperative, weeding was only done on the edges of the fields, and the middle was full of grass, and the topdressing was piled up without being applied at all; some cooperative members slept while irrigating the land, and the water flooded three feet deep, destroying the crops. At this time, everyone condemned those irresponsible cooperative members and cadres and realized that it was not the cooperativization system and the Party's policies that were bad, but that there were shortcomings in the local work. The cooperative members' confidence in running the cooperatives was consolidated.
    In early spring this year, the County Party Committee found that many farmers were running to the cities because they envied urban life, and people's hearts were a little shaken, and the mood of the cadres running the cooperatives was also affected. This phenomenon was quite common. In order to reverse this trend, they organized a large-scale propaganda and education campaign in March and April. On the one hand, they publicized that socialist rural construction has broad prospects and that agricultural labor is glorious labor; on the other hand, they told everyone that a large number of urban cadres are also being transferred to the countryside, and demobilized soldiers and graduating students will also come to the countryside in large numbers. The "Farmers' Daily" run by the County Party Committee also seized on the fact that the farmer Sun Jianyuan liked industry and disliked agriculture, ran into the city, spent money in vain, and ran back, and launched a discussion. At the same time, another "proposal" movement for building mountainous areas and developing production was organized. Cooperatives that had made achievements in building mountainous areas and those that were relatively backward all launched specific and vivid discussions and planned many construction projects that would certainly achieve success. Forestry and animal husbandry plans such as "Wanji Mountain," "Huaguo Valley," and "Grape Depression" and construction plans for soil and water conservation deeply attracted the broad masses of cooperative members. The unhealthy trend of running to the cities was suppressed.
    Since May, with the stirring of the right-wing elements in the cities, an evil spirit has also been floating in the countryside. The method of retaining grain rations according to the number of people last year caused difficulties in grain for some farm households with many adults and single men. Some lazy loafers and farmers who wasted grain in a big way also clamored that the grain rations were too small and not enough to eat. Some well-to-do middle peasants and landlords and rich peasants who were dissatisfied with the cooperativization and the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain took the opportunity to become active. At this time, the County Party Committee mobilized the whole Party, calling on everyone to calculate whether there was enough grain to eat with the spirit of diligence and thrift in managing the family, saving grain, supporting national construction, and supporting disaster areas. Later, the discussion was expanded to the cooperative members. As a result of the discussion and calculation in the cooperatives, the masses believed that the grain retention was basically enough. Some households did not have enough to eat, and the masses helped them find the reasons: some were newly married wives who did not bring food stamps, some were daughters who brought their nephews to live for a few months, some did not know how to save when holding weddings and funerals, some used grain to feed pigs and chickens at will, and some used grain to exchange for broad beans and refreshments... The old men and women were particularly happy with the slogan "diligence and thrift in managing the family," and criticized their sons and daughters for wasting and opposed asking the state for grain. They said: Our family still has grain, and if we save a little, it will be enough. Some put out the grain to show that they could not finish eating it until the big autumn harvest, and declared that if the state wanted to buy it, they could sell it themselves. In this way, the clamor over the grain issue was suppressed by the masses. A small number of people who really did not have enough to eat were adjusted by the cooperative itself and solved. At the same time, some people who engaged in speculative business, idled around, and liked to steal were criticized by the masses. This mass discussion is still going on.
    The leadership method of the mass line is applied in many ways, so that many disputes can be resolved smoothly and rationally, and the cooperative is consolidated step by step. The Huashaoying Agricultural Cooperative (more than 900 households) in the disaster area lacked grain in June this year, and the cooperative members needed to borrow grain from the cooperative to buy grain. At the beginning, some lazy people and "households with the ability to repay the loan" took out loans that should not have been taken out, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses and caused a lot of discussion. The cooperative registered it and needed to loan 3,100 yuan. However, the credit cooperative only had 2,000 yuan, which was not enough. They wanted to mobilize the masses to evaluate, but they were afraid that everyone would want to take out a loan, so they did not dare to mobilize. The secretary of the County Party Committee came, and he first showed everyone the "family background" of the cooperative, explained the principles of "unlimited production and limited loans" and "labor is glorious and lazy people are shameful," and called on everyone to evaluate fairly, speak with conscience, and speak fairly. As a result of organizing the masses to evaluate, those who should not have taken out loans were evaluated by the masses, and those who should have taken out less loans were reduced. The loans that were really needed were only 1,800 yuan, which the cooperative could completely solve by itself. In this way, the amount of loans was reduced, and the masses were still satisfied.
    Xuanhua County pays great attention to the class line in running the cooperatives, and they have generally paid attention to cultivating and establishing poor peasant backbones in the agricultural cooperatives. More than 80% of the responsible cadres in the county's agricultural cooperatives are poor peasants. These poor peasant cadres have played a mainstay role every time a storm strikes. They opposed the slander of the cooperatives, opposed exaggerating difficulties, and opposed being indecisive. In the autumn distribution of the Songjiazhuang Cooperative, due to the high estimate of production, there was an overspending, and there was a deficit of more than 7,000 yuan, and some households could not get the share they should have received. The cooperative had rice straw to sell, but it could not be sold for a while. The middle peasant cooperative members said: "This is what we earned from working for a year. We have to sell the mule to distribute it immediately." Yao Wenzhong, a poor peasant cooperative member, took out his only 50 yuan to invest in the cooperative to help the cooperative overcome the difficulties. Other poor peasants responded to the cooperative's call and invested in the cooperative, and the deficit of more than 7,000 yuan was solved in this way. This year, there was a shortage of 12,000 jin of horse feed for livestock during the spring ploughing, which was also solved by the investment of poor peasants. In some cooperatives, well-to-do middle peasants fabricated facts to undermine the reputation of poor peasant cadres, and mass counterattacks were organized in a timely manner. The establishment of the poor peasants' superiority in the cooperative is an important reason for the consolidation of the agricultural cooperatives.
    Finally, it should also be especially mentioned that the comrades of the Xuanhua County Party Committee pay great attention to going deep into the countryside and providing specific leadership. The registration form for going to the countryside in the County Party Committee office records that in the past nine months this year, 10 of the 17 County Party Committee members have been in the countryside for more than 100 days. Shi Qingxiang, secretary of the County Party Committee, has been to the countryside 19 times in nine months, for a total of 142 days; Zhao Gang, deputy secretary, has been to the countryside 15 times, for a total of 144 days; Zhao Xu, deputy county magistrate, has been to the countryside 14 times, for a total of 148 days... They spent more than half of their days in the countryside. This has enabled them to avoid red tape, to constantly hear the opinions and demands of the masses, and to discover and solve the problems that occur in the agricultural cooperatives at any time and any place.

    宣化县二年来没有一户退社的
    本报记者　林韦
    富于生命力的禾苗，会从石头缝里钻出来。在党和人民政府培育之下代表着新的生产力的农业合作社，只要有正确的领导，就一定能够不断地成长发展，并且一步步地巩固起来。河北省宣化县农业合作化二年以来没有一户退社，这个事实充分地说明了这一规律。
    不但没有一户退社，今年春天还有四十多户申请入社。去年全县有六十多户单干农民，现在只剩二十户了。
    为了弄清宣化县的农业合作社二年来没有一户退社的原因，记者最近访问了中共宣化县委和宣化县其他一些办社同志。根据各方面的材料，这个县在合作化以后的二年来在发展生产方面是有很大成绩的。为了农业增产，他们曾经在全县范围内大规模兴修水利，打井四百六十三眼，开渠二百四十六道，修水库七座，使水地增加八万五千二百九十四亩，这个数目相当于解放以前全县水地面积的55.3％。他们在山区实行闸沟垫地等许多措施来保持水土，使三百多平方公里的水土得以有效控制。1956年春的积肥运动高潮，挖掘了多方面的肥源；加上养猪业的迅速发展，全县大部分耕地的施肥量在近二年来有了显著的增加。此外还有增种高产作物（玉米等）、合理密植及套种、间作等等。这些措施，使去年在风雹霜冻等严重的自然灾害下保持了当地较高的产量（一百四十五斤）。使全县九十七个社有七十二个增产（其余二十五社因灾减产）。副业方面，去年后半年以后也有了相当的发展。同今年上半年加在一起，副业收入总共达到三百六十五万多元。全县二十三万人口，每人平均十五元多。林业牧业的发展，也给农民带来不少的好处。各方面生产的发展，使社员的收入普遍有了增加。据统计，90％以上社员增加收入的，全县有四十三个社，80％以上社员增加收入的有二十个社，70％以上社员增加收入的有九个社。农民家里从前生煤炉的很少，现在很多了；青年和妇女们穿洋布、斜纹布已经不算很好的，有许多人开始穿卡叽布了；皮衣、绒衣、呢帽、花衫、搪瓷脸盆、暖水瓶、手电筒……这二年来有了急剧的增加。拿现在的生活同从前的生活相比，大多数农民都感到合作化有许多的好处。这是宣化县农业合作社比较巩固的物质基础。
    当然，仅仅靠物质基础是不能使合作社巩固起来的，为了巩固合作社，这个县还十分注意对广大群众的思想政治工作。
    思想政治领导当然离不开各时期具体的业务领导，即生产和建设的领导。宣化县委为了增加农业生产，发展山区经济，曾经全力领导各个季节的农事活动，帮助各社克服资金、畜力、肥料、饲料各方面的困难，组织了大规模的水土保持工作和林业畜牧业活动。这些都是很重要的，不能缺少的。但是，如果没有另外一方面即思想政治方面的工作，这里的农业合作社就决不可能像今天这样巩固。
    在1956年2、3月间，农村开始达到全面合作化的时候，农民群众以至许多基层办社的干部都有一些糊涂观念。他们只知道社会主义是一种非常幸福的生活，但却不知道要取得这种幸福的生活还有一段非常艰苦的路，必须付出非常艰苦的劳动。他们两眼望着国家，指望国家赐予贷款，赐予机器，赐予电灯电话……。劳动的时候，许多社员看到社里制度不完善，不严密，或者有不合理的地方，没有用主人公的态度积极起来建议改进，而是用各种方法钻空子，只管自己挣工分，不管质量，不管对生产有何影响。一般老实社员看见这样不对头，但也没有办法，做活也就马虎起来。干部呢？满脑子盲目乐观情绪，好像认为既然合作化了，那就不管怎么样也会增产。有一些人只是追求八小时工作制，上班下班之类的形式，却很少注意真正的增产措施和山区建设。这样下去，当然事情会弄糟的。县委针对这种情况，在2、3月间及时地组织了大规模的宣传教育运动，中心口号是“劳动创造幸福”，说明幸福不能凭空取得，必须靠自己的双手来修水利，搞肥料，精耕细作，改良土地，才能提高农业产量；必须充分利用山地发展林业牧业……。县委们和县里许多干部到处去向社员群众作报告，组织大家讨论。运动普遍开展，努力劳动的新空气代替了原来的不良空气：上下班制度取消了，做活不管质量的现象大大减少，积极建设山区、兴家立业的空气浓厚起来。许多靠山村庄都组织人力进山沟，种树，养羊，养鸡，养兔。有些村开始在山坡上大量修筑鱼鳞坑，也有的修大水库，或者闸沟垫地……。这次运动使人们在思想上明白了一些根本问题，同时推动了多方面的生产建设活动，对农业合作社的巩固起了很好的作用。
    去年这个县提倡多种玉米（高产作物），从前年的六万多亩一下增加到三十二万亩，群众本来就有点不大习惯（这里群众不大爱吃玉米）；而有一些社又不顾地质、肥料等条件，种得过分稠密，追肥和锄苗也没有搞好，结果造成部分的减收。到秋季，有些地主、富农和富裕中农利用一部分群众的不满情绪就嚷叫起来，说合作社没有优越性，办坏了，有的要求党和政府以后不要管生产，只向社里要多少公粮算了。地方报纸没有充分考虑第一年办社缺少经验这个事实，一股脑批评地方上官僚主义，主观主义。这种片面的批评起了推波助澜的作用，使空气更形紧张。从10月下半月起，县委又一次组织了全县范围的讨论，主题是“究竟办好了办坏了”，“合作社有无优越性”。各社根据县委提议，纷纷算帐，摆事实，讲道理。算帐的结果，全县九十七个社（大社），有七十二个都增产了，社员生活也提高了。只有二十五个社减了产，但主要原因是自然灾害。有的社只有个别生产队（自然村）减产，原因是田间作业做得太坏。比如宋家庄社有一个队，锄地只锄地边，中间尽是草，追肥堆着，根本没上；有的社员浇地时睡觉，水灌了三尺深，庄稼都给淹坏了。这时，大家都纷纷谴责那些不负责任的社员和干部，明白了不是合作化制度和党的政策不好，而是当地工作中有缺点。社员们办社的信心随着巩固起来。
    今年初春，县委发现不少农民因羡慕城市生活，往城市跑，人心有点动荡，办社干部的情绪也受到影响。这现象有相当的普遍性。为扭转这种风气，3、4月间他们又组织了大规模的宣传教育运动。一方面宣传社会主义农村建设有远大的前景，农业劳动是光荣的劳动；一方面告诉大家城市干部也在大量下放到农村，复员转业军人和毕业学生也要大量到农村来。县委办的“农民报”也抓住农民孙建元喜工厌农，跑进城去白花了钱又跑回来的事实，展开讨论。与此同时，又一次组织了建设山区、发展生产的“献计”运动。建设山区已有成绩的和比较落后的社，都展开了具体生动的讨论，规划了许多肯定会取得成就的建设项目。“万鸡山”、“花果沟”、“葡萄洼”之类的林牧业规划和水土保持方面的建设规划，深深地吸引了广大社员。往城市跑的歪风被压下去了。
    5月份以来，随着城市中右派分子的蠢动，农村中也有一股邪气浮动起来。去年按人头留口粮的办法，使一些大人多的农户和光棍汉子粮食发生了困难。有些好吃懒做的二流子和大手大脚浪费了粮食的农户，也嚷嚷留粮少，不够吃。一些不满意合作化和粮食统购统销政策的富裕中农和地主富农，就乘机活动起来。这时候，县委在全党进行了动员，号召大家用勤俭持家、节约粮食、支援国家建设、支援灾区的精神来计算粮食究竟够不够吃。以后把讨论扩大到社员群众中去。各社讨论计算的结果，群众认为留粮基本上是够吃的。有一些户不够吃，群众都帮助他们找出了原因：有的是新娶了媳妇没带来粮票，有的是闺女带着外甥来住了几个月，有的是办红白喜事不知节约，有的是随意用粮食喂猪喂鸡，还有的用粮食去换蚕豆换点心……。老头子老太太们特别高兴“勤俭持家”的口号，当场批评儿子和媳妇浪费，反对向国家要粮食。他们说：咱家还有粮食，节省一点就够了。有的把粮食摆出来，说明到大秋下来也吃不完，声明国家要买自己还可以卖。这样，粮食问题的吵嚷给群众压下去了。少数真不够吃的，由本社自己作些调剂，解决了。与此同时，一些做投机生意的，游手好闲的，喜欢偷窃的，都受到群众的批评。这种群众性的讨论现在还在继续进行。
    群众路线的领导方法，多方面被应用着，使许多纠纷得到顺利的合理的解决，社就随着巩固一步。灾区化梢营农业社（九百多户）今年6月缺粮，社员都需要向社贷款买粮。开始时有些懒汉和“有还款能力的户”不该贷而贷了，引起群众不满，纷纷议论。社里登记了一下，需要贷款三千一百元。而信用社只有二千元，不够。要发动群众评议，又怕人人都要贷，因而不敢发动。县委书记来了，他首先给大家亮明社的“家底”，讲清“生产无穷、贷款有限”和“劳动光荣、懒汉可耻”的道理，号召大家公平评议，说良心话，说公道话。组织群众评议的结果，不该贷的都给群众评下去了，应当少贷的都减少了。真正需要的贷款只有一千八百元，本社完全可以自己解决。这样，贷款数量减少，群众还满意。
    宣化县很注意办社中的阶级路线，他们在农业合作社内普遍注意了培养和树立贫农骨干。全县农业社中80％以上的负责干部，都是贫农。在每次风浪袭来的时候，这些贫农干部都起了中流砥柱的作用。他们反对对合作社的诽谤，反对夸大困难，反对三心二意。宋家庄社去秋分配中因估产偏高，发生超支，亏空七千多元，有些户应分的部分分不到手。社里有稻草可卖，又一时卖不出。中农社员说：“这是劳动一年挣到的，卖骡子也得马上给分。”贫农社员要文中把仅有的五十元钱拿出来向社投资，帮助社克服困难。其他贫农纷纷响应社的号召，向社投资，七千多元的亏空就这样解决了。今年春耕时牲口缺马料一万二千斤，也是靠贫农投资解决的。有的社富裕中农捏造事实来破坏贫农干部的名誉，都及时地组织了群众性的反击。贫农优势在社内的确立，是农业合作社得以巩固的重要原因。
      最后还应当特别提到的，是宣化县的县委同志们很注意深入农村，具体领导。在县委机关的下乡登记表上记载着：今年九个月来，十七个县委委员中有十个人下乡在一百天以上。县委书记史庆祥九个月下乡十九次，共一百四十二天；副书记赵刚下乡十五次，共一百四十四天；副县长赵绪下乡十四次，共一百四十八天……他们有半数以上的日子是在乡下度过的。这使他们避免了文牍主义，能够经常听到群众的意见和要求，随时随地发现和解决农业合作社里发生的问题。
