    Xinhua News Agency, Aleppo, 6th: Syrian President al-Quwatli said on the 5th that the imperialist fleets, military exercises and military build-ups have not affected Syria’s nerves.

    At a banquet held in his honor by the Aleppo Cotton Textile Manufacturers Association, al-Quwatli said that Syria is not unprepared. We do not want to invade anyone, but we do not want anyone to invade us either.

    Al-Quwatli said that Syria's economic situation is as stable and sound as its political situation. He told the merchants of Aleppo that the reason your wealth has been preserved is because we have defended our independence and sovereignty.

    Xinhua News Agency, 6th: TASS, Damascus: According to "Victory Daily," the Syrian military authorities intercepted a secret document on September 18 this year, from which they learned of an American plan to attack Syria.

    The newspaper said that according to this plan, American and Israeli troops were to launch an attack on Syria along the entire Syrian-Israeli border on September 27, attempting to draw the main force of the Syrian army to this front, so that the American air force and paratroopers could occupy some major areas of Syria.

    In order to implement this military operation, the United States also demanded that the Iraqi government send troops to attack Syria. "Victory Daily" said that Iraqi Prime Minister Ayubi confirmed this during his recent visit to Damascus. Ayubi declared to Syrian leaders that the Iraqi government had refused the demands made by Washington.

    "Victory Daily" said that after learning of this information, the Syrian authorities took emergency measures, on the one hand preparing to fight back against aggression, and on the other hand, preventing the activities of those hostile elements in the country who were preparing to cooperate with the invaders. This forced the invaders to abandon their original plan.

    库阿特利总统说
    叙利亚不怕帝国主义挑衅
    叙军方截获美国企图进攻的秘密计划
    据新华社阿勒颇6日电　叙利亚总统库阿特利5日说，帝国主义的舰队、军事演习和军事集结并没有使叙利亚的神经受到影响。
    库阿特利在阿勒颇棉纺业工厂主联合会为他举行的宴会上说，叙利亚并不是毫无戒备的。我们不想侵略任何人，但是也不愿任何人侵略我们。
    库阿特利说，叙利亚的经济情况同它的政治局势一样稳定而健全。他对阿勒颇的商人们说，你们的财富所以能够保存，是因为我们保卫了我们的独立和主权。
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社大马士革讯：据“胜利报”报道，叙利亚军事机关在今年9月18日截获了一封密件，从这封密件中获悉美国企图进攻叙利亚的计划。
    这家报纸说，根据这个计划，美国和以色列的军队要在9月27日在叙利亚和以色列的整个边境上发动对叙利亚的进攻，企图把叙利亚军队的全部主力吸引到这方面来，使美国空军和降落伞部队能够占领叙利亚的一些主要地区。
    为了实行这一军事行动，美国还要求伊拉克政府出兵进攻叙利亚。“胜利报”说，伊拉克首相阿尤比不久以前在大马士革访问期间曾经证实了这点。阿尤比向叙利亚的领导人声明，伊拉克政府已经拒绝华盛顿方面所提出的要求。
    “胜利报”说叙利亚当局在获悉这项情报以后采取了紧急措施，一方面准备反击侵略，另一方面制止了国内那些准备为侵略者作内应的敌对分子的活动。这样迫使侵略者放弃了他们原来的计划。
