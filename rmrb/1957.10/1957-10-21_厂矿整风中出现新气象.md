A New Atmosphere Appears in Factory and Mine Rectification

    Jilin State-Owned Coal Mines
    Annual Production Increase Plan Exceeded
    Jilin's state-owned coal mines have already exceeded their annual production increase and savings plan. As of October 12th, the Liaoyuan, Tonghua, and Jiaohe Mining Bureaus had collectively increased raw coal production for the state by 95,746 tons.
    Since the launch of the socialist great debate, the workers and staff of each mining bureau have put forward more than 36,000 opinions. The leaders of each mine actively implemented the spirit of "rectification and correction simultaneously," enabling some key problems hindering production to be reasonably resolved. Therefore, since the third quarter, production in each mine has risen month by month. The Liaoyuan Mining Bureau reversed the situation of underproduction in the first half of the year during the rectification movement, exceeding production by 60,000 tons of coal in the third quarter.
    During the rectification movement, Party and government leading cadres of each mine also earnestly changed their leadership style, went deep into the pits and grassroots levels to improve enterprise production management, and promoted advanced experiences, thereby further inspiring the enthusiasm of workers and staff to carry out socialist competition.
    Shanxi Industrial and Mining Enterprises
    Problems Solved Quickly, Worker Enthusiasm High
    Since the launch of the rectification movement in Shanxi Province's industrial and mining enterprises, the vast majority of factory and mine leading cadres have stepped out of their offices and gone deep into workshops and work sections. Because leading cadres have gone deep among the masses, the opinions of workers and staff have been handled promptly. According to statistics from 23 units in Datong City, of the more than 5,700 opinions put forward by workers and staff, more than 3,800 have been addressed. All 133 opinions put forward by workers and staff of the Jincheng Coal Mine have been completely addressed.
    Due to the timely resolution of problems by the leadership, the production enthusiasm of workers and staff has been boosted, and a new atmosphere has emerged in the production of various enterprises. The Datong Mining Bureau, which had long failed to complete its plan, now has a daily output of more than 1,960 tons, 560 tons more than the previous highest daily output. The economic accounting system of the Jincheng Coal Mine had never been promoted, but now it is being implemented. In the first month of implementation, production costs were reduced by 21%.
    Resolving Problems While Saving Funds
    Chengdu Workers Implement the Principle of Building the Country Through Diligence and Thrift
    Workers and staff in many factories in Chengdu City have paid attention to implementing the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift, studying and improving their work in the rectification movement, and striving to achieve results without spending money or spending less money.
    The workers in the forging workshop of the Chengdu Locomotive Repair Factory requested the purchase of iron-making hearths and toolboxes during the "airing of views," but during the rectification and correction process, the workers decided to use existing bricks and sheet metal to build red hearths and toolboxes themselves, rather than spending the state's purchase funds, in accordance with the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift and running enterprises diligently and thriftily. The workers in the locomotive workshop of this factory put forward more than 100 opinions related to production and life during the "airing of views." By actively finding solutions and doing it themselves, 56 of them were resolved without spending a penny.
    Similar situations exist in many units in Chengdu City. In some factories, the electrical workshop was too crowded. The workers initially requested the addition of houses, but after everyone's research, the problem could be solved by simply adjusting the process layout.

### 厂矿整风中出现新气象

    厂矿整风中出现新气象
    吉林国营煤矿
    今年增产计划超额完成
    吉林各国营煤矿已经超额完成了全年增产节约计划。截至10月12日止，辽源、通化、蛟河三个矿务局共为国家增产原煤九万五千七百四十六吨。
    各矿务局职工自从开展社会主义大辩论以来，共提出三万六千多条意见，各矿领导积极贯彻边整边改精神，使一些障碍生产的关键问题得到合理解决。因此，第三季度以来各矿生产都逐月上升。辽源矿务局在整风中扭转了上半年欠产局面，三季度内共超产六万吨煤。
    在整风中各矿党政领导干部还切实转变领导作风，深入坑口和基层改进企业生产管理工作，推广先进经验，因此，进一步鼓舞了职工开展社会主义竞赛的热情。
    山西工矿企业
    问题解决快  职工热情高
    山西省工矿企业开展整风运动以来，绝大多数厂矿的领导干部都走出了办公室，深入车间、工段。由于领导干部深入群众，职工们的意见都能得到及时处理。据大同市二十三个单位统计，职工们提出的五千七百多条意见中，有三千八百多条已得到处理。晋城煤矿职工们提出的一百三十三条意见，已经全部处理完毕。
    由于领导方面及时解决问题，鼓舞了职工的生产热情，各企业的生产出现了新气象。过去长期完不成计划的大同矿务局，现在日产量已经达到一千九百六十吨以上，比过去的最高日产量多了五百六十吨。晋城煤矿的经济核算制从来没有得到推广，现在也执行了，执行的头一个月，生产成本就降低了21％。
    既解决问题  又节省资金
    成都职工贯彻勤俭建国原则
    成都市许多工厂职工注意贯彻勤俭建国的方针，在整风中研究改进工作，尽量作到不花钱或少花钱。
    成都机车修理厂锻工车间工人在鸣放中要求购置打铁洪炉和工具箱，但在整改中，工人们根据勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针，决定自己动手用现有砖料、铁皮修筑红炉和工具箱，而不花费国家的购置费。这个厂的机车车间职工，在鸣放中提出的一百多条有关生产、生活上的意见，由于积极想办法，自己动手，有五十六条解决时一文未花。
    类似这样的情况，在成都市的许多单位都有。有的工厂电工车间太挤，职工们开始要求添盖房屋，可是经过大家研究，只要调整一下工艺布置就可以解决问题。
