	Rich Hydroelectric Resources
	As soon as you enter the Hydroelectric Power Construction Exhibition, a colorful map of China immediately catches your eye. The guide turns on the switch, and you see blue rivers crisscrossing the beautiful land. Here are the famous Yangtze River, Yarlung Zangbo River, Nujiang River, Yellow River, Lancang River, Pearl River, and Heilongjiang River systems. According to the average flow of 1,598 major rivers, the country has a total of 540 million kilowatts of hydroelectric resources. This figure is more than the total hydroelectric resources of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Norway, and Japan combined. As the guide explains, countless red and green lights representing the addresses of hydropower stations appear on the map. These hydropower station addresses are evenly distributed, close to industrial areas, and have large reserves of resources, many reaching one million kilowatts or more than five million kilowatts. In the Yarlung Zangbo River and the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River in the southwest, several hydropower stations with more than 10 million kilowatts can be built.

	Engineers' Ideals Realized
	Before liberation, many hydroelectric construction experts dreamed of dedicating their lives to developing the rich hydroelectric resources of the motherland. However, during the decades of Kuomintang rule, the total installed capacity of completed hydropower stations was only 12,000 kilowatts. This turned their hopes into disappointment.

	The exhibition has two vivid examples illustrating the contrast between before and after liberation. One is Huang Yuxian, the current chief engineer of the Hydroelectric Construction Bureau, who spent 20 years working on the Longxi River cascade development project. Before liberation, because the Kuomintang refused to invest money sincerely in construction, Huang Yuxian only completed a small hydropower station with a capacity of 3,000 kilowatts, despite spending a lot of effort. Only eight years after the founding of New China, two brand-new hydropower stations have been erected on the upper reaches of the Longxi River, of which the Shizitan Hydropower Station alone has a power generation capacity of 48,000 kilowatts; two other hydropower stations downstream are also under construction. Huang Yuxian said with emotion: "My 20-year wish has finally come true today!"

	Another example is the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, which is even larger than the Fengman Hydropower Station. Before liberation, engineer Xu Qiaoshi and other hydropower experts had repeatedly inspected the area, hoping to personally build a hydropower station in such a scenic place. This hope was impossible to realize before liberation. But in New China, Xu Qiaoshi's hope was realized. He personally took charge of the survey and preliminary design of the hydropower station and personally led the construction.

	Many charts in the exhibition show that since liberation, 19 large and medium-sized hydropower stations have started construction in my country, with a total installed capacity of 2.72 million kilowatts. Among them, 520,000 kilowatts were generated during the first five-year plan alone, which is more than 43 times the total capacity of all hydropower stations built during the Kuomintang rule.

	Prototype of Rural Electrification
	Near the exit of the exhibition, a model of a rural hydropower station particularly attracted people's interest. This is a model of the Beizi Village Hydropower Station in Jiyuan County, Henan Province. The hydropower station is built in a place with a large slope on two spring water rivers. It can generate 36 kilowatt-hours of electricity per hour. During the day, it provides power for oil mills, and at night, it provides lighting for 545 lights in local schools, libraries, clubs, and agricultural production cooperatives.

	This hydropower station was built by relying on the strength of the masses from ten nearby agricultural cooperatives. The total investment was more than 57,000 yuan, and the state only paid for the motor costs of 20,000 yuan. Now they are preparing to build a flour mill and expand the lighting lines, so that they can create 520,000 yuan of wealth throughout the year.

	According to charts, as of the end of June this year, there were 361 rural hydropower stations across the country, with an installed capacity of 14,920 kilowatts, with the most in Sichuan, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guizhou provinces.

	Beautiful and Brilliant Prospects
	At the end of the exhibition, the audience was shown the prospects for my country's hydropower construction industry.

	Here are displayed the basin plans and long-term development schematic diagrams of China's three largest rivers - the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and the Heilongjiang River. The total reserves of hydroelectric resources in these three rivers are nearly 300 million kilowatts, flowing through most areas of our country. Now, the Yangtze River has initially selected more than a dozen hydropower station dam sites. Among them, the famous Three Gorges alone will have a power generation capacity of 20 million kilowatts; in the future, after completion, cheap electricity can be obtained within a range of 2,000 kilometers east from Shanghai to Ya'an, south from Guangzhou to Beijing. After the completion of all 46 cascade hydropower stations determined in the Yellow River plan, not only can the thousands of years of Yellow River disasters be eliminated from now on, and the turbid river water will become clear, but also 23 million kilowatts of electricity can be generated, making the entire North China and Northwest regions electrified. Scientists from China and the Soviet Union are continuing to survey the Heilongjiang River basin, and have currently proposed preliminary construction plans for eight hydropower stations, the largest of which is larger than the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station.

	Other major rivers are also being surveyed, and basin plans are planned to be drawn up in the next few years. Although this is still just a future plan, with the victory of socialist construction, it will definitely be realized.

　　看水力发电建设展览

    水力资源丰富
    一走进水力发电建设展览会的大门，立刻有一张彩色的中国地图映进眼帘。讲解员打开电扭，只见美丽的国土上，蓝色的江河纵横交叉。这里有著名的长江，雅鲁藏布江，怒江，黄河，澜沧江，珠江和黑龙江等水系。根据一千五百九十八条主要河流的平均流量估算，全国共有五亿四千万瓩的水力资源。这个数字比美国、英国、法国、意大利、挪威、日本六个国家的水力资源总和还多。随着讲解员的讲解，地图上还出现了无数代表水电站地址的红绿灯。这些水电站地址分布均匀，离工业地区很近，资源的蕴藏量也都很大，很多达一百万瓩或五百万瓩以上。在西南的雅鲁藏布江和长江三峡，还可以建设好几个一千万瓩以上的水电站。工程师们的理想实现了
    解放以前，我国有许多水电建设专家梦寐以求地希望把自己的终身献给开发祖国丰富的水力资源。但是在国民党统治的几十年间，全部建成的水电站发电容量只有一万二千瓩。这使他们的希望变成了失望。
    展览会上有两个生动的事例，说明了解放前后的对比。一个是现任水电建设总局总工程师黄育贤曾经从事二十年的龙溪河梯级开发工程。解放前因为国民党不肯拿出钱来真心建设，黄育贤虽然花了很多心血，最后只建成了一个容量三千瓩的小水电站。新中国成立才八年，现在有两个崭新的水电站已经在龙溪河上游矗立起来，其中只是狮子滩水电站的发电能力就有四万八千瓩；下游的另外两个水电站也在施工。黄育贤感慨地说：“二十年的愿望今天才实现了！”
    另一个是比丰满水电站还大的新安江水电站。解放以前，工程师徐洽时和别的水电专家曾经多次到那里去察看过，希望在这样一个风景秀丽的地方亲手建设起一个水电站。这个希望在解放前是根本无法实现的。但是在新中国，徐洽时的希望实现了，他亲自负责了这个水电站的勘测和初步设计，并且亲自领导着施工。
    展览会上的许多图表表明，解放以来我国开工建设的大中型水电站已有十九个，设备容量可达二百七十二万瓩。其中仅第一个五年计划内发电的就有五十二万瓩，相当于国民党统治时期所建全部水电站容量的四十三倍多。
    农村电气化的雏型
    在展览会快要出口的地方，一个农村水电站的模型特别引起人们的兴趣。这是河南省济源县碑子村水电站的模型。水电站建设在两条泉水河流坡度大的地方，每小时能发三十六度电，白天供榨油厂动力用电，晚上供当地学校、图书馆、俱乐部和农业生产合作社五百四十五盏电灯照明。
    这个水电站是依靠附近十个农业合作社的群众力量兴建起来的，全部投资五万七千多元，国家仅负担两万元电机费。现在他们准备再建设一个面粉厂和扩大照明线路，这样，全年就能创造五十二万元财富。
    根据图表表明，截至今年6月底，全国已有农村水电站三百六十一处，装机容量一万四千九百二十瓩，以四川、福建、浙江、贵州等省最多。
    美丽光辉的远景
    展览会在最后向观众展示了我国水力发电建设事业的远景。
    这里陈列着我国三条最大的河流——长江、黄河、黑龙江的流域规划和远景开发示意图。这三条河流水力资源的总蕴藏量有将近三亿瓩，流经我国绝大部分地区。现在，长江已经初步选好了十多个水电站坝址。其中只是著名的三峡，发电能力将达二千万瓩；将来建成以后，东从上海西到雅安、南自广州北达北京的二千公里范围以内，都可以得到便宜的电力。黄河规划中确定的四十六个梯级水电站全部建成以后，不但可以使数千年的黄河灾害从此绝迹，混浊的河水从此变清，还能发出二千三百万瓩电力，使华北、西北整个地区全部电气化。黑龙江流域中苏两国的科学家还在继续勘测，目前已经提出了八个水电站的初步建设方案，其中最大的比三门峡水电站还大。
    其他各条主要河流也都正在勘测，计划最近几年内都要订出流域规划。虽然这还只是未来的规划，但是随着社会主义建设的胜利，它是一定会实现的。
