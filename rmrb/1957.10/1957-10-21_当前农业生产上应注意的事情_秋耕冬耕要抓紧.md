    Important Matters to Note in Current Agricultural Production
    Seize the Autumn and Winter Ploughs
    Following the autumn harvest and planting, the next agricultural activity is to plough the winter fallow land in autumn and winter. The total area of winter fallow land that should be ploughed in autumn and winter across the country is about 800 million mu, with the largest proportion being in the northern regions that have one harvest per year. Seizing the time and leading farmers to actively do this is of utmost importance for striving for increased production in 1958.
    Autumn and winter ploughing can not only prevent drought and conserve soil moisture, ensuring timely sowing next spring, but also promote soil weathering, increase soil fertility, and reduce pests, diseases and weeds. Farmers have sayings such as "Autumn ploughing is like watering, and seedlings will be even without rain in the spring," and "Deep ploughing is like applying fertilizer." Local experiences have also proven that the yield-increasing effect of autumn and winter ploughing is extremely significant. In the Zhelimumeng region of Inner Mongolia, autumn ploughing has resulted in an increase in production of about 20% in recent years. According to thirty-one comparative experiments in Hubei Province, land that has been deeply ploughed in autumn and winter can increase rice production by 11% to 18% or increase cotton production by 15% to 21%.
    This autumn, most areas in the north and some areas in the south are experiencing a lack of rain, and the drought-affected area is very large. The soil is dry, hard, and compacted, which has brought difficulties to autumn and winter ploughing. Some flooded areas were drained relatively late and need to be ploughed in autumn and winter now. Therefore, this is an urgent and arduous task. The shortage of labor and animal power is a serious problem in this year's autumn and winter ploughing. According to reports from Hebei Province, in some places each draught animal has to plough more than 100 mu of land on average. This difficulty of insufficient animal power must be overcome by various means. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives in various places must rationally organize rural labor and animal power, and government agencies, schools, and military units in various places should also provide support.
    In autumn and winter ploughing, it is best to use double-wheeled, double-furrow ploughs and new-style walking ploughs as much as possible. In the past eight years, more than 1.46 million double-wheeled, double-furrow ploughs and more than 80,000 new-style walking ploughs have been promoted across the country. These are important agricultural implements for autumn and winter ploughing, and their effectiveness should be fully utilized. Agricultural machinery and tractor stations in various places have now developed greatly and should better exert their strength in autumn and winter ploughing.
    Leading bodies in various places should strengthen specific leadership over autumn and winter ploughing work. Experience has proven that as long as Party and government leaders at all levels grasp this work firmly, autumn and winter ploughing can be carried out smoothly. In the past, Changli County in Hebei Province did not have the habit of autumn ploughing. In the past two or three years, due to vigorous demonstration and promotion, the area of autumn ploughing in 1956 reached more than 700,000 mu, accounting for more than 60% of the cultivated land. Since 1954, the cotton-growing areas of Chengan County in this province have vigorously advocated autumn and winter ploughing, and now they have universally changed the past habits of not pulling out cotton stalks and not ploughing the land. In 1956, due to the active promotion of the leading bodies in Tuquan County, Inner Mongolia, the area of autumn ploughing expanded to more than 390,000 mu, accounting for 26% of the county's cultivated land. We should pay attention to these experiences and do this year's autumn and winter ploughing work quickly and well.

    当前农业生产上应注意的事情
    秋耕冬耕要抓紧
    紧接着秋收秋种以后的农事活动，就是要对冬闲地进行秋耕冬耕。全国应秋耕冬耕的冬闲地约有八亿亩左右，其中以北方一年一熟地区的比重为最大。抓紧时间，领导农民积极作好这件事情，对争取1958年增产有极重要的意义。
    实行秋耕、冬耕，不仅可以防旱保墒，保证明春适时播种，还可促进土壤风化，增进土壤肥力，可以减除病虫和杂草。农民中就有“秋天耕地如浇地，春日无雨苗也齐”“深耕如上粪”等农谚。各地的经验也证明，秋耕、冬耕的增产效果极为显著。内蒙古哲里木盟几年来秋耕的结果，增产达20％左右。根据湖北省的三十一处对比试验看，秋冬季深耕过的土地，可增产水稻11％—18％或增产棉花15％—21％。
    今年秋季北方大部地区和南方部分地区缺雨，受旱的面积很大，土壤干硬板结，给秋、冬耕带来了困难。一些受涝的地区，大部脱水较晚，需要现在进行秋耕冬耕。因此，这是一项迫切而艰巨的任务。劳力、畜力的不足是今年秋、冬耕当中的严重问题。据河北省反映，有的地方每头耕畜平均负担耕地一百多亩。这种畜力不足的困难，必须从多方面设法加以克服。因此，各地农业社要合理组织农村劳力、畜力，各地的机关、学校、部队也应该给予支援。
    在秋耕冬耕中，最好尽量使用双轮双铧犁和新式步犁。八年来，全国推广的双轮双铧犁已达一百四十六万多部，新式步犁八万多部，这是秋、冬耕的重要农具，应当充分发挥它们的效能。各地农业机器拖拉机站现在已有很大的发展，应该在秋、冬耕中更好地发挥它们的力量。
    各地领导机关应当加强对秋耕、冬耕工作的具体领导。经验证明，只要各级党政领导抓紧这一工作，秋、冬耕就能顺利开展。河北省昌黎县过去没有秋耕习惯，近二、三年来由于大力示范推广，1956年秋耕面积已达七十多万亩，占应耕地的60％以上。这个省成安县棉区，自1954年大力倡导秋耕、冬耕以来，现在已普遍改变了过去不拔棉秸，不耕地的习惯。1956年内蒙古突泉县，由于领导机关积极推动，秋耕面积扩大到三十九万多亩，占全县耕地的26％。我们应当重视这些经验，把今年的秋耕、冬耕工作做得又快又好。
