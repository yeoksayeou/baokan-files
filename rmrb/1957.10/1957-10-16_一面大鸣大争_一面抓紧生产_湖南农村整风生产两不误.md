Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Dispatch. Party organizations at all levels in Hunan Province, in leading the mass airing of views and great debates in rural areas, have paid attention to closely integrating this with production, ensuring that both rectification and production are not neglected. Currently, more than 50,000 agricultural cooperatives across the province are simultaneously carrying out the airing of views and debates while also seizing the time to accumulate fertilizer and cut grass, taking advantage of post-rain conditions to rush-plow and sow winter crops.

This year, the autumn and winter production in Hunan's rural areas started early and is of high quality. According to statistics from the agricultural department, by the beginning of October, more than 13 million mu of land had been sown, and the habit of extensive sowing had been changed.

Since the launch of the Socialist Education Movement in August throughout the province, township and cooperative cadres have participated in production during the day and led mass meetings for airing views and debates in the evening. Therefore, production has not been affected throughout the entire movement. Originally, due to severe drought conditions, it was estimated that only 8 million mu of double-cropping late rice could be completed. However, after farmers actively fought the drought and rushed to plant, 10.58 million mu were completed. In many places in the Shaoyang Special District, the number of people attending autumn and winter production was even higher than during the spring plowing season, and labor competitions were enthusiastically launched. In the Changde Special District, 2.46 million people were working daily. After over fulfilling the autumn sowing task by 16%, they took advantage of the post-rain conditions to rush-plow winter crops, mobilizing 400,000 people and 80,000 head of cattle to plow more than 2 million mu of hard land in half a month.

Experience from various places has proven that only by earnestly grasping current production while carrying out the airing of views can the airing of views be carried out smoothly and achieve practical results from the movement.

    一面大鸣大争　一面抓紧生产
    湖南农村整风生产两不误
    新华社长沙电　湖南省各级党组织在领导农村大鸣大放中，注意紧密结合生产，做到了整风、生产两不误。现在，全省五万多个农业社正一面展开鸣放和争辩，一面抓紧积肥铲草，趁雨后突击抢耕冬种。
    今年，湖南农村秋冬生产动手早、质量好。据农业部门统计，到10月初，已有一千三百多万亩土地完成了播种工作，并且改变了播种粗放的习惯。
    全省自8月开展社会主义教育运动以来，乡、社干部都是白天参加生产，晚上领导群众开会鸣放。因此，各地在整个运动期间始终没有影响生产。原来因旱情严重估计只能完成八百万亩双季晚稻，经农民积极抗旱抢种，结果完成了一千零五十八万亩。邵阳专区许多地方在秋冬生产中出勤人数比春耕时期还多，并热烈地开展了劳动竞赛。常德专区每天有二百四十六万人出勤，他们超额16％完成秋播任务后，又趁雨后抢耕冬种，每天出动四十万人和八万头耕牛，在半月内就翻耕了二百多万亩板田。
    根据各地经验证明，只有在搞好鸣放的同时认真抓紧当前生产，才能顺利开展鸣放，收到运动的实际效果。
