Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th. Many factories in Shanghai are paying attention to mobilizing and relying on veteran workers to promote a healthier and more in-depth development of the rectification movement.

Various factories have adopted diverse methods to mobilize veteran workers. The Shanghai Turbine Factory, through convening symposiums with veteran workers, organizing interview or reception groups, conducting individual heart-to-heart talks, and organizing veteran workers to visit other veteran workers, has dispelled their concerns, allowing them more opportunities to speak their minds freely. The leadership of Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 1, which has about three thousand veteran workers, tries its best to help veteran workers with low literacy levels write big-character posters.

Once mobilized, veteran workers are very active in the rectification campaign. In any factory undergoing rectification, you can hear the cordial voices of veteran workers. They all say that they are the people who have watched the factory develop; the factory is their home. When the family has shortcomings, veteran workers have a special responsibility to help them take a bath. Veteran worker Wang Fuchang of the China Record Factory put it well: "Yes! We have been building the country for more than eight years. Even a piece of clothing needs to be washed!"

The opinions put forward by veteran workers are mostly pertinent and based on cherishing the Communist Party and state-owned enterprises. They raise the most opinions about the factory's waste, disregard for product quality, failure to protect equipment, failure to pay attention to the role of veteran workers, and connivance at bad tendencies among young workers. Veteran workers in the diesel engine workshop of the Shanghai Turbine Factory are unhappy with three things: first, they cannot stand the leadership's lack of cherishing state property; second, they cannot stand the waste of manpower; and third, they cannot stand the leadership's failure to seriously deal with the illegal and disciplined behavior and lax labor discipline of some young workers. Some veteran workers in the Shanghai Shipyard, in their big-character posters, even cited the example of Chairman Mao going deep into the countryside to conduct investigations and write the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" to criticize the shortcomings of the factory's leading cadres in being divorced from the masses. Chen Caigen, a veteran worker who has worked in the China Textile Machinery Factory for nearly twenty years, wrote a big-character poster: "Before liberation, we shared hardships with many leading cadres for a long time, calling each other brothers and being very affectionate. We know Comrade Yin Zhaofa (Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee) and Xin Quangen (Deputy Director) so well that we even know your birth dates, what nicknames you have, and how many people there are in your family. We have also personally witnessed how you have grown up under the education of the Party. Now you are the leaders of everyone, and we are very happy, but you have become arrogant. When you meet us, you look up to the sky and ignore us, as if old friends of many years are strangers. When we see your arrogance, we don't want to approach you." While requesting the leadership to correct the lax labor discipline of some young workers, the veteran workers of Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 1 also proposed restoring the attendance system and including attendance rates in the socialist competition indicators. The many sincere opinions put forward by veteran workers were not considered by the leading cadres of many factories.

Many veteran workers with more than 20 years of service in State-owned Cotton Mill No. 17 have a lot of opinions on the way the factory trains, promotes, and educates young workers today. Veteran worker Chen Jintao said: "Last year, the newspaper introduced that the Shanghai Steel Mill No. 2 trained a third-grade electrician in twenty-three days, and the leadership convened a meeting of our veteran workers, mobilizing us to do the same. We responded to the call of the leadership and thought that twenty-three days would not work, so let's make it forty-six days! In fact, learning technology is not that simple! Some young workers have studied for a few months, and they don't have much technique, but the first time they are rated, they are at least fourth-grade workers, and their wages immediately jump from more than twenty yuan to sixty yuan. Many of our veteran masters have been working for twenty or thirty years and only make sixty or seventy yuan, eighty or ninety yuan." Xin Genfa, who has worked for twenty-two years, said: "My son has only been in the factory for more than a year, but his salary is almost the same as mine. From my personal point of view, isn't it good for my son to earn more money? However, it is not good for young people. Some young people spend money recklessly when they have more money, and they look down on the masters. Production is careless, and they are no longer active in learning technology. We tell young people to endure hardship and be hard-working, and tell them how difficult it was for us to learn technology when we were young, but some young people don't listen, and it's really disheartening."

The veteran workers all pointed out that the factory's leadership does not provide enough communist moral education to young workers. They suggested that young people's wages should be gradually increased. This will encourage them to improve.

While relentlessly exposing the shortcomings of the leadership, the veteran workers expressed great indignation at the few erroneous remarks that appeared in the rectification campaign. Zhu Yuliang, a veteran worker in the Shanghai Shipyard, said in a big-character poster that the Party committee secretary and the factory director received a large amount of hardship allowances, which left a bad impression on the masses. Later, some people with ulterior motives described this as the leading cadres' "secret bonus" and "sitting on the ground and dividing the spoils," and slandered the leading cadres as "jackals." Zhu Yuliang immediately wrote a big-character poster, "Resolutely Extinguish the Wildfire," to oppose this malicious attack.

Veteran workers pay special attention to ensuring good production during the rectification campaign, and they have posted their pledges on the dedication platform. Some veteran workers have also created new records and new tools. Individual young workers who take a rest before leaving work during the rectification campaign have also been criticized by the masters.

The role of veteran workers in the rectification campaign has deeply moved the leading cadres of many factories. They have sorted out the opinions of the veteran workers, and some shortcomings have now been improved. The leaders of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 17 and the China Record Factory and other factories are also planning to hold regular symposiums for veteran workers every month, and the Party Committee of Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 1 has also specifically designated Thursday afternoons as reception days.

    上海许多工厂找到改进工作的可靠力量
    老工人在整风中态度积极意见中肯
    据新华社上海11日电　上海许多工厂注意发动和依靠老工人，使整风运动更健康深入地开展。
    各工厂采取了多种多样的方式来发动老工人。上海汽轮机厂通过召集老工人座谈会，组织采访组或接待组，进行个别谈心，以及组织老工人访问老工人等方式，解除老工人的顾虑，让他们有更多的机会畅所欲言。约有三千个老工人的上海卷烟一厂的领导方面，尽量设法帮助文化水平低的老工人书写大字报。
    老工人们一经发动起来，对整风非常积极，随便到那一个正在整风的工厂，都可以听到老工人们亲切的声音。他们都说，他们是眼看着工厂发展起来的人，工厂就是他们的家，当家人有缺点，老工人特别有责任帮助他们洗个澡。中国唱片厂老工人王福昌说得好：“是啊！我们建国已经八年多了，一件衣服嘛也要洗洗了”。
    老工人提出的意见绝大部分都很中肯，都是从爱护共产党、爱护国家企业出发的。他们对工厂的浪费、不重视产品质量、不爱护设备、不注意发挥老工人的作用、对青年工人中的不良倾向迁就等缺点，提出的意见最多。上海汽轮机厂柴油机车间的老工人有三件事看不惯：一是对领导上不爱惜国家财富看不惯；二是对浪费人力看不惯；三是对领导上不严肃处理有的青年工人违法乱纪、劳动纪律松懈的事看不惯。上海船舶修造厂有的老工人在大字报中，还举出毛主席深入农村作调查，写出“湖南农民运动考察报告”的事例，来批评本厂领导干部脱离群众的缺点。在中国纺织机械厂工作了近二十年的老工人陈财根写了一张大字报：“解放前，我们曾经同许多领导干部长期共患难，称兄道弟，非常亲热。殷照发（党委副书记）、忻全根（副厂长）等同志，我们熟悉得连你们的出生年月，有什么绰号，家庭有多少人口都知道，我们也亲眼看到你们在党的教育下如何成长起来。现在你们是大家的领导，我们很高兴，但是你们却变得架子大起来了，遇到我们眼睛朝天，不睬人，多年朋友好像陌生人。我们看到你们这种架子，就不愿意接近你们了。”上海卷烟一厂的老工人们在要求领导方面纠正部分青年工人劳动纪律松懈同时，并提出恢复考勤制度、把出勤率列入社会主义竞赛指标的建议。老工人们诚挚地提出的许多意见，都是许多工厂领导干部原来没有考虑到的。
    国棉十七厂很多有二十年以上工龄的老工人，对今天厂里培养、提拔和教育青年工人的方式方法很有意见。老工人陈金涛说：“去年报纸上介绍上钢二厂二十三天内培养了一个三级电工，领导上就召集我们老工人开会，动员我们也这样做。我们响应领导上的号召，想想二十三天不行，就四十六天吧！其实，学技术哪能这么简单！有的青工学了几个月，技术没有多少，第一次评级起码就是四级工，工资立即由二十多元跳到六十元。我们很多老师傅做了二、三十年也不过六、七十元，八、九十元。”做了二十二年工的辛根发说：“我儿子不过进厂一年多，拿的工资却跟我差不多。从我个人来说，儿子多拿些工钱还不好吗？但是，对青年人没有好处。有些青年人钱一多，就乱花一通，也瞧不起老师傅了。生产呢，吊儿郎当，学技术再也不积极了。我们告诉年轻人要吃苦耐劳，告诉他们我们年轻时学点技术多么困难，有些青年就听不进去，想想真有些寒心。”
    老工人们都提出，厂的领导对青年工人的共产主义品德教育不够。他们建议说：年轻人的工资还是慢慢加上去的好。这样才能鼓励他们上进。
    老工人们一方面毫不容情地揭发领导的缺点，一方面对整风中出现的少数错误言论表示很愤慨。上海船舶修造厂老工人朱毓良，在大字报上说：党委书记和厂长领取了数字较大的困难补助金，群众印象不好。后来，有人别有用心地把这件事说成是领导干部的“秘密奖金”、“坐地分赃”，把领导干部诬蔑成“豺狼”。朱毓良马上写了一张“坚决扑灭野火”的大字报，来反对这种恶意的攻击。
    老工人在整风中对保证搞好生产特别重视，他们纷纷把自己的保证书贴在献礼台上。有些老工人还创造了新纪录、新工具。个别青年工人在整风中未下班就先休息，也受到老师傅的批评。
    老工人在整风中的作用深深感动了许多工厂的领导干部，他们把老工人的意见进行整理，有的缺点现在已经有了改进。国棉十七厂、中国唱片厂等厂领导方面还打算以后每月定期召开老工人座谈会，上海卷烟一厂党委会也专门订出每星期四的下午为接待日。
