    “Streamlining Enterprise Management Structures with a Revolutionary Spirit”
    Your newspaper's September 28th editorial, "Streamlining Enterprise Management Structures with a Revolutionary Spirit," raises a timely issue. However, I feel that one statement in the third paragraph is not entirely appropriate. Specifically, it says, "In the past, in capitalist private enterprises, management personnel in some small and medium-sized factories generally accounted for only 7% to 8% of the total workforce, while in many of our current factories, management personnel generally account for more than 15% of the total workforce, and in some cases, even half. This is detrimental to national industrialization." The intention is to criticize the shortcomings of our bloated management structures, thereby drawing the attention of enterprise leaders and relevant parties. This is correct. However, comparing the small proportion of management personnel in past capitalist enterprises with the larger number (temporary) in our socialist enterprises without analysis is clearly inappropriate and could give people the false impression that capitalist enterprises are superior to socialist enterprises.
    I believe that when the Party newspaper discusses these issues, it must provide a thorough and in-depth analysis. Luo Shengtong

### “用革命的精神精简企业管理机构”

    “用革命的精神精简企业管理机构”
    你报9月28日社论“用革命的精神精简企业管理机构”，问题是提得适时的。但我感到社论的第三段有一处提法不够恰当，即“过去，在资本主义私营企业里，有些中小型工厂的管理人员一般只占总人数7％到8％，而我们现在有好多工厂的管理人员一般都占总人数的15％以上，有的甚至占了一半。这对国家工业化是不利的。”其目的是为了批判我们管理机构臃肿的缺点，从而引起企业领导和有关方面的重视。这是对的。但是，这里对过去资本主义企业管理人员比例小与我们社会主义企业管理人员多（暂时的）不加分析地对照，显然是很不对的，会给人家一种错觉：资本主义企业优于社会主义企业。
    我觉得党报在谈到这些问题时，必须作深透的分析。　罗胜桐
