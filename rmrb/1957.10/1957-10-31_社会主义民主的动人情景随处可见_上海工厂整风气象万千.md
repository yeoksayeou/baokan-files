    Shanghai, October 30th (By our reporter Ji Yin) – Stirring scenes of socialist democracy are filling many factories in Shanghai that are currently undergoing rectification. A lively and vigorous new situation, one with both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, is gradually taking shape in these factories. This is the overall impression the reporter gained after visiting some factories and observing their rectification efforts.

    Currently, over 210 large or relatively large factories and enterprises in Shanghai, with approximately 300,000 employees, are enthusiastically launching the rectification movement. Most factories have already transitioned or are transitioning from "great airing and speaking out" (大放大鸣) to "great debate" (大争), while also vigorously improving enterprise operations and the work style of cadres. Mass debate is currently the main content of Shanghai's factory rectification movement. Facts over the past two months have proven that debate is a good key for the masses to conduct self-education using democratic methods. In some factories in Shanghai, the thoroughness of thought exposure and the depth of excavation in this debate are rarely seen in previous ideological education movements. The most prominent examples are the debates at the Shanghai Boiler Factory and Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 regarding three young workers (Gu Liufa, Yang Changfa, and Li Kaizhan). In this debate, people used the most persuasive method, namely holding a life contrast exhibition, which stirred up a major debate of right and wrong among older and younger workers. All three workers had suffered greatly in the old society and achieved liberation after liberation. However, in recent years, due to the erosion of capitalist ideology, they gradually forgot their past suffering, seriously cultivated individualistic desires, and ultimately became dissatisfied with the status quo, uttering various erroneous statements. This is a typical example with universal significance among Shanghai workers. This great debate provided Shanghai workers, especially young workers, with a profound and unforgettable lesson, and had a deep impact on people's thinking.

    The airing of views and debates in over 200 factories in Shanghai are continuing to unfold and deepen. Many fundamental issues in national political life and enterprise work are being brought to the masses for discussion, especially issues closely related to the interests of employees. For example, the Shanghai Turbine Factory and the joint state-private China Textile Machinery Factory workers are debating the issues of wages and quotas very heatedly. In the debate, the Textile Machinery Factory workers used rich facts to refute the erroneous arguments that "quota setters are barbers" and "quotas exploit workers," explaining that today's problem is not that quotas are high, but rather that quotas are generally conservative and backward, and that there are too many unreasonable excess bonuses. However, the discussion also reflected that in the implementation of the quota system, individual quotas also have the drawback of being too high. Based on this debate, the administration made a reasonable adjustment to the quotas based on the discussions of the workers.

    The infinite vitality of socialist democracy is most evident in the activities of rectifying and improving while working in factories and enterprises. Solving problems quickly, thoroughly, and satisfactorily is a new change in the rectification work of many factories. The Shanghai Turbine Factory resolved more than 2,000 problems in two months. The Shanghai Shipyard handled an average of more than 170 opinions from the masses every day during the rectification period, a speed that had never been seen before. But the problem is not just about speed and quantity, but also that many of the problems being solved are long-standing cases that have been pending for many years. What seemed difficult in the past is now being cleared up one by one. This kind of thing happens in almost every factory. For example, State-owned Cotton Mill No. 17 had a muddy road that was wet all year round, and workers often slipped and caused work-related injuries. It was requested to be renovated four years ago, but it was delayed due to various reasons. This time, the leading cadres and workers worked together to repair it, and it was repaired in a few days. The workers of the Shanghai Turbine Factory also hoped to adjust the factory holiday from Monday to Sunday, which was also an old issue that was raised a long time ago. In the past, it seemed to involve a lot of things and was difficult to handle, but this time it was also resolved smoothly. Many factories have resolutely abandoned the unnecessary cumbersome procedures and procrastination of the past in dealing with problems, and do their best to handle them as soon as they arrive.

    The rectification of Shanghai's factories and enterprises has adopted the practice of launching debates immediately after airing and speaking out freely, and putting the systematic reform of institutions and organizations in the next step. This is because more ideological problems have emerged in the airing of views in Shanghai's factories. The leadership has considered that if some major issues of right and wrong are not first clarified in the minds of the masses, fundamental reforms in institutions and organizations will be difficult to promote and implement. However, the rectification of Shanghai's factories does not relax the work of rectifying and improving while working. Factories are striving to solve some problems that can be solved immediately as quickly as possible.

    At the current stage, Shanghai is placing the thorough change of cadres' thinking and work style, overcoming the three isms (bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism), and close contact with the masses in the primary position of rectifying and improving while working in the factories undergoing rectification. Cadres at all levels above the workshop director in each factory, especially party member cadres, are joining the rectification movement with all employees, listening to the criticism of the masses, and correcting shortcomings and mistakes under the help and supervision of the masses. In many factories in Shanghai, interesting stories about cadres changing their work style can be heard everywhere. Chen Zhangming, the deputy director of the pre-spinning workshop of the Second Workshop of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 17, used to go down to the workshop without deep contact with the workers. He always crossed his arms and looked around with a stern face before leaving. The workers secretly called him "Observer." In the past, Chen Zhangming did not find his shortcomings. This time, the workers raised their opinions to him, and he earnestly improved and got very close to the workshop workers. The title of "Observer" was cancelled. In the wiring workshop of the joint state-private China Electric Factory, there was a Communist Party member named Jiang Manbin, who the workers called "Family Party Member" because he used to run home as soon as he got off work and did not approach the masses. But this "Family Party Member" has changed in this rectification movement. He corrected his shortcomings and became a close friend of the surrounding masses. The mass democratic movement is like a large metallurgical furnace, tempering cadres at all levels in the factory, burning away their shortcomings, preserving and developing their advantages, and increasing their connection with the masses.

    During the rectification period, the production order of Shanghai's factories was well-organized. The attendance rate in many factories increased, the phenomenon of non-compliance with labor discipline was significantly reduced, and the labor competition continued.

    Due to the large number of factories and the complexity of the situation in Shanghai, the rectification movement is strictly carried out in batches and phases. The second batch of units is currently underway. The rectification of a large number of small factories in Shanghai will be postponed slightly. After the debate comes to an end, the rectification movement in the factories will enter the stage of systematically carrying out organizational and institutional reforms.

    社会主义民主的动人情景随处可见
    上海工厂整风气象万千
    本报上海30日电　记者季音报道：社会主义民主的动人景象，充满着上海许多正在进行整风的工厂里。一个又有集中、又有民主，又有纪律、又有自由的生动活泼的新局面，正在这些工厂里逐步形成中。这是记者参观了一些工厂整风情况后的总印象。
    上海市现在已有二百一十多个大型或较大的工厂企业，约三十余万职工，在热情澎湃地展开整风运动，目前大部分工厂已经或正由大放大鸣而转入大争，同时又大力地改进企业工作和干部作风。群众性的大辩论是目前上海工厂整风运动的主要内容。两个月来的事实证明，辩论是群众用民主方法进行自我教育的良好锁钥，上海一些工厂中，这次辩论中思想暴露之充分，挖掘之深刻彻底，是过去历次思想教育运动中所稀见的。最突出的例子是上海锅炉厂、上海国棉一厂关于三个青年工人（顾六法、羊长发、李开展）的辩论，这次辩论中人们运用了最有说服力的方法，即举行生活对比展览的方法，在老年、青年工人中掀起了一场大是大非的争论。这三个工人都是在旧社会里受尽折磨，在解放后得到翻身的，但是他们在近年来由于资本主义思想的侵蚀、逐渐忘掉了昔日的痛苦，严重的滋长了个人主义的欲望，最后就不满现状，发出了种种错误言论。这是上海工人中具有普遍意义的典型。这场大辩论给上海工人，尤其是青年工人上了深刻难忘的一课，在人们的思想中发生了深刻的影响。
    上海二百多个工厂中的鸣放和辩论现在正在继续展开和深入，许多国家政治生活，企业工作中的根本问题，正在一个个的被提到群众中间进行讨论，尤其是与职工切身有关的问题，例如关于工资和定额问题，上海汽轮机厂和公私合营中国纺织机械厂职工，都争论得很热烈。纺织机械厂职工在辩论中用丰富的事实驳倒了“定额员是剃头师傅”、“定额是剥削工人”的错误论调，说明今天的问题并不是定额高，普遍的倒是定额保守、落后，不合理的超额奖过多。但讨论中也反映出，定额制度在执行中，个别定额也有偏高的缺点，就在这一辩论的基础上，行政根据职工群众的讨论，将定额作了一次合理的调整。
    社会主义民主的无限活力，在工厂企业边整边改的活动中表现得最明显。解决问题迅速、彻底、圆满，这是许多工厂这次在整改工作中的新变化，上海汽轮机厂在两个月中解决了二千多个问题。上海船厂在整风期间平均每天处理群众意见一百七十余条，这种速度在过去是从未有过的。但问题还不在于速度和数量，还在于这些被解决的问题，有不少都是拖了多年悬而未决的积案。过去看来似乎困难重重，现在却一一清理了结了。这类事几乎在各厂都有。例如国棉十七厂有一段终年潮湿的烂泥路，工人时常滑跌而造成工伤事故，在四年前就要求翻修，一直因各种原因拖了下来，这次领导干部和工人一齐动手来修，不几天就修好了。上海汽轮机厂的工人，希望把厂休日由原来的星期一调整为星期天，也是个很早就提出的旧事，过去似乎牵扯很多，不好办，这回也顺利解决了。许多厂在处理问题中，都坚决抛弃了过去那种不必要的繁琐手续和拖拉作风，做到随到随办。
    上海工厂企业的整风是采取了在大鸣大放之后，紧接着展开辩论的做法，而把系统地进行制度上和组织上的改革放在下一步，这是由于上海各厂在鸣放中出现的思想问题比较多，领导上考虑到好些大是大非问题如果不在群众思想上首先求得初步的澄清，制度和组织上的根本改革就会难以推行和贯彻。但是上海工厂整风并不因此而放松边整边改工作，一些能够立即解决的问题，各工厂都力求最快的解决。
    在目前阶段，上海在整风的工厂中把彻底改变干部的思想与工作作风、克服三个主义（官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义），密切与群众的联系，摆在边整边改的首要地位。各工厂从工段长以上的各级干部，特别是党员干部，正在与全体职工一起卷入整风运动，倾听群众的批评，在群众的帮助、督促之下改正缺点和错误。在上海不少工厂里，到处都可以听到一些关于干部改变作风的有趣故事。国棉十七厂二工场前纺车间副主任陈章铭，过去下车间不深入接触工人，总是两手岔着腰，扳起脸孔东张西望一阵就走，工人们背地里叫他做“观察家”。过去陈章铭对自己的缺点没有发现，这次工人们把对他的意见提了出来，他就认真改进，和车间工人关系搞得很亲热，“观察家”的头衔取消了。在公私合营中国电工厂拉线车间里，有一个共产党员蒋满彬，工人们叫他“家庭党员”，原因是他过去一下班就往家里跑，不和群众接近，但这次整风运动中这个“家庭党员”变化了，他改正了自己的缺点，变成了周围群众的亲密朋友。群众性的民主运动就这样像一座大冶金炉一样锻炼着工厂里的各级干部，烧去了他们身上的缺点，保存和发扬了他们的优点，增进了他们和群众的联系。
    在整风期间，上海各工厂的生产秩序井然，许多厂出勤率上升，不守劳动纪律的现象显著减少，劳动竞赛持续地进行着。
    由于上海工厂数量庞大，情况复杂，因此整风运动严格按照分批分期地进行的方针，目前正在进行的是第二批单位。上海大量小型工厂的整风，时间将稍为推后。在争辩告一段落之后，工厂中整风运动就将进入系统地进行组织、制度改革的阶段。
