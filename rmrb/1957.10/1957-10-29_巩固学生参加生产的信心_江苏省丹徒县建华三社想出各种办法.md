To consolidate the confidence of students in participating in production, Jianhua Third Cooperative in Ruli Township, Dantu County, Jiangsu Province, has devised various methods.

(Reported by this newspaper) This year, ten primary and secondary school graduates in Jianhua Third Cooperative, Ruli Township, Dantu County, Jiangsu Province, participated in agricultural production. Most of the graduates have relatively stable emotions and can humbly learn production techniques from experienced farmers. However, a few individuals, due to insufficient understanding of the significance of participating in agricultural labor, are not emotionally stable enough. They plan to pursue further education next year and prepare to attend cram schools. Additionally, some graduates face specific problems in production and life, such as individual parents preventing their children from participating in agricultural production, and a few graduates having less than normal relationships with cooperative cadres, leading to mental distress and affecting their production morale. In response to this situation, the cooperative has adopted a series of measures to conduct in-depth ideological education for the graduates, stabilizing their ideological mood for participating in production.

These measures are:

First, educating parents to correctly address the issue of their children participating in production. For example, classmate Zhu Weigen has good labor habits and is very enthusiastic after participating in production. However, due to reduced wheat production this year and a lack of planning in the family's food consumption, they faced temporary difficulties in life. His father did not specifically analyze these circumstances or find ways to solve the difficulties, but instead scolded him every day, causing Zhu Weigen to feel mentally distressed and passive. In response to this situation, the cooperative both educated and comforted Zhu Weigen, and worked with cooperative cadres to help him solve the current practical difficulties in life. At the same time, his parents were also educated. This stabilized Zhu Weigen's ideological mood, and his parents also expressed their willingness to let their child train on the production front.

Second, coordinating the relationship between graduates and cadres through visits. For example, junior high school graduate Zhu Muyin had some disagreements with the team leader, and the team leader therefore disliked him. Zhu Muyin himself was also very distressed. The cooperative then educated him on "humbly learning from farmers" on the one hand, and talked to the team leader on the other. They first casually discussed the achievements and roles of graduates participating in production, and then explained that cadres have the responsibility of nurturing new forces. In this way, the ideological knots of both were eliminated. The team leader took the initiative to ask Muyin to attend meetings. Muyin dispelled his distress and enthusiastically devoted himself to production.

Third, further carrying out social propaganda to establish correct social opinions. For example, classmate Zhu Yiguo was very active in participating in labor production, but he did not have the habit of labor, and his physical strength was not strong enough when he first participated in production, and his lymph nodes became inflamed.

Some people said, "Yiguo used to be white and fat, but now he is black and thin," which caused Zhu Yiguo to have ideological fluctuations. In response to this problem, the cooperative comforted and encouraged him on the one hand, and educated his parents on the other hand. At the same time, at the cooperative members' meeting, they affirmed the achievements of graduates participating in production, and explained that this was inseparable from the help of cadres and cooperative members. They also made appropriate criticisms of some incorrect opinions, which greatly educated everyone.

After the above problems were solved, the cooperative conducted a comprehensive family visit. Now the production mood of all middle and primary school graduates in the cooperative is high, and they are actively engaged in autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and housework.

In addition, the cooperative has also formed a "Ruli Township Jianhua Third Cooperative Graduate Work Guidance Group" composed of the cooperative director, the Communist Youth League branch, primary and secondary school principals, and the chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, responsible for the regular graduate work. For example, the production teams often help them solve difficulties in production and life in order to improve the relationship between graduates and cadres. The Communist Youth League branch also absorbs them into Communist Youth League classes, organizes them to participate in central work, and cares about their political demands.

Primary and secondary schools send people to visit graduates once or twice a week. During National Day, New Year's Day, and other festivals, they are invited to participate in activities, report production achievements, and organize parties and seminars to consolidate their enthusiasm for labor.

The cooperative also agreed that primary and secondary schools would open libraries for them, help them organize basketball teams, engage in club work, and participate in literacy activities. Through this series of activities suitable for young people's characteristics, they are united, so that they can settle down in agricultural production.

### 巩固学生参加生产的信心  江苏省丹徒县建华三社想出各种办法

    巩固学生参加生产的信心
    江苏省丹徒县建华三社想出各种办法
    本报讯　江苏省丹徒县儒里乡建华三社，今年有十名中小学毕业生参加农业生产。毕业生参加生产后，多数人情绪都较稳定，能虚心向老农学习生产技术。但是也有少数人由于对参加农业劳动的意义认识不足，情绪还不够稳定，他们打算明年再升学，准备去上补习班。还有些毕业生由于在生产上、生活上碰到一些具体问题，如个别家长阻止子女参加农业生产，少数毕业生与社干关系不够正常，思想苦闷，影响了生产情绪。根据这种情况，该社采取了一系列措施，对毕业生进行深入的思想教育，稳定了毕业生参加生产的思想情绪。
    这些措施是：
    一、教育家长正确对待子女参加生产的问题。如朱慰根同学有劳动习惯，参加生产后劲头很大；但因今年麦子减产，家里吃粮计划性又不强，一时生活发生了困难，他父亲不具体分析这些情况，设法解决困难，却天天骂他，使朱慰根思想苦闷、消极。社里针对这种情况，一面对朱慰根进行教育和安慰；一面会同社干，帮助他解决了当前生活上的实际困难，同时又对他家长进行了教育，这样朱慰根的思想情绪就稳定了，家长也表示愿意让孩子在生产战线上锻炼。
    二、通过访问，协调毕业生和干部的关系。如初中毕业生朱慕银，曾经和队长闹了些意见，因此队长对他看不惯，他本人思想也很苦闷。社里便一方面对他进行“要向农民虚心学习”的教育；一方面找队长谈话，先漫谈了毕业生参加生产的成绩和作用，又说明干部负有培养新生力量的责任，这样，两人的思想疙瘩都消除了。队长主动的找慕银去开会，慕银消除了苦闷，更加热情地投入生产。
    三、进一步开展社会宣传，树立正确的社会舆论。如朱益国同学，参加劳动生产倒很积极，但他没有劳动习惯，初参加生产，体力不够强，淋巴腺发炎了。
    有些人就说“益国过去又白又胖，现在又黑又瘦了”，结果引起了朱益国思想波动。针对这个问题，社里一方面对他进行安慰和鼓励，对他家长进行教育；另一方面，又在社员大会上，肯定毕业生参加生产的成绩，并说明这是和干部、社员帮助分不开的，同时也针对一些不正确的舆论作了适当的批判，对大家的教育很大。
    以上问题解决后，该社又进行了全面的家庭访问，现在全社的中、小学毕业生的生产情绪高涨，都积极地投入了秋收秋种工作和家务劳动。
    此外，该社还由社主任、团分支、中小学校长、工商联主任组成了“儒里乡建华三社毕业生工作指导小组”，负责经常性的毕业生工作。如各生产队经常帮助他们解决生产上、生活上的困难，以搞好毕业生和干部的关系。团分支也吸收他们上团课，组织他们参加中心工作，并关心他们政治上的要求。
    中小学每周派人访问毕业生一两次，每逢国庆、元旦等节日，就邀请他们参加活动，报告生产成绩，组织联欢和座谈，巩固他们的劳动热情。
    社里还约定中小学为他们开设图书馆，帮助他们组织篮球队，搞俱乐部工作，参加扫盲活动。通过这一系列适合青年特点的活动，把他们团结起来，使他们安心于农业生产。
