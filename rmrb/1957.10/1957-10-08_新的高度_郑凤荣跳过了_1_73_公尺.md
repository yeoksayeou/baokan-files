A New Height
——Zheng Fengrong Clears 1.73 Meters
By Our Reporters Ai Tiemin and Shi Yuzhong

　　At a little past four o'clock on the afternoon of the 7th, an attention-grabbing announcement came from the loudspeakers on the rostrum of the track and field meet: "Zheng Fengrong's high jump is about to begin."

　　At this time, the audience in the stands crowded to the southwest corner, wanting to be closer to Zheng Fengrong's high jump location and see more clearly. The stands were packed. People were whispering, "Yesterday she only cleared 1.68 meters. Will she be able to break her record of 1.72 meters set in Berlin this time?" The audience was concerned, and so were the athletes, coaches, and referees.

　　It was almost five o'clock. Zheng Fengrong took off her outer sportswear, tried a few strides, and then the high jump competition began. The stands and the field immediately erupted in warm applause. This burst of applause was expectation and encouragement.

　　She cleared the starting height of 1.55 meters effortlessly. The bar continued to rise, 1.60 meters, 1.65 meters, and then 1.70 meters, all cleared. When she cleared 1.70 meters, the bar was touched by her body, trembled a few times, and people's hearts immediately became tense. "How many centimeters should the next height be raised?" Everyone waited anxiously. When the announcement board displayed 1.73 meters, another thunderous applause erupted. At the same time, everyone nervously watched for the emergence of the new record. Faced with this new height, Zheng Fengrong's first attempt failed. However, her relaxed and cheerful expression gave the audience increased confidence. After a short rest, Zheng Fengrong walked to her pre-measured starting point, took a deep breath, swung her arms, and began a very relaxed and natural seven-step approach. Suddenly, her steps became faster and faster, and she leaped up in front of the sandpit. When people focused, Zheng Fengrong had already cleared this thrilling height. At this moment, some of the audience in the stands jumped up, and some shouted. High jump athletes Fu Xueyan, Li Dapei, and others, who were participating in the meeting, immediately ran over to shake hands with her and congratulate her. Soviet high jump athlete V. Sitkin also shook hands with her to congratulate her. She was surrounded by a crowd of well-wishers.

　　1.73 meters cleared. The referee and she discussed setting the next height at 1.77 meters (1 centimeter higher than the world record). Zheng Fengrong modestly said, "I can't clear it, lower it a little!" The referee still let her try, and she agreed.

　　The bar was raised to 1.77 meters. The audience held their breath, anticipating the arrival of even better results. Once, twice, three times, without success.

　　However, judging from today's performance, people believe that as long as Zheng Fengrong overcomes arrogance and impetuosity and continues her efforts, she has the potential to clear the height of 1.77 meters.

　　1.73 meters, this is a new height, which not only represents a new achievement in women's high jump in our country but also shows that our women's high jump performance is closer to the world record.

　　People are looking forward to our excellent high jump athletes reaching new heights. (Attached picture)

    新的高度
    ——郑凤荣跳过了1.73公尺
    本报记者　艾铁民　施毓忠
    7日下午四点多钟，田径运动会主席台上的扩音器里传出了引人注意的消息：“郑凤荣跳高就要开始了”。
    这时，看台上的观众都挤到西南角上来了，他们想距离郑凤荣的跳高地点更近一些，看得更清楚一些。看台上，挤得水泄不通。人们都在交头接耳：“昨天只跳过了一公尺六十八公分，这次她是否能打破她在柏林创造的一公尺七十二公分的纪录呢？”观众在关心着，运动员们、指导们和裁判们也在关心着。
    快到五点了。郑凤荣脱了外面的运动衣，试了几次步点以后，跳高比赛就开始了。看台上和场内立刻响起了热烈的掌声。这一阵掌声，是企望，也是鼓励。
    一公尺五十五公分的起跳高度，她毫不费力地一跃而过。横竿不断地向上升，一公尺六十公分、一公尺六十五公分、直到一公尺七十公分，她都跳过去了。当她跳过一公尺七十公分的时候，横竿被她的身体触动，颤动了几下，人们的心里立刻紧张起来。“下一个高度该升几公分呢？”大家焦急地等待着。当报分台上传出了一公尺七十三公分时，又爆发了一阵雷鸣似的掌声。同时，所有的人都紧张地、关心着新成绩的出现。在这个新的高度面前，郑凤荣第一次试跳失败了。但是，她的轻松愉快的神情给观众们增加了信心。休息片刻以后，只见郑凤荣走到她早已量好的起跑地点，深深地吸了一口气，两臂摆动，开始了非常轻松自然的七步助跑，忽然她的步子越来越快，到了沙坑前一跃而起，当人们定神看时，郑凤荣已经跳过了这个动人心魄的高度。这时，看台上的观众有的跳起来，有的喊叫着。参加这次大会的跳高运动员傅雪雁、李大培等都立刻跑过来和她握手祝贺。苏联跳高运动员弗·西特金也和她握手祝贺。她被祝贺的人群包围起来。
    一公尺七十三公分跳过去了。裁判员和她商量把下一高度放在一公尺七十七公分上（高出世界纪录一公分），郑凤荣谦虚地说：“我跳不过去，低一点吧！”裁判员仍然让她试试，她同意了。
    横竿升到了一公尺七十七公分。观众都屏住了气，期待着更好的成绩的来临。一次、两次、三次，没有成功。
    但是，从今天跳的情况来看，人们相信，只要郑凤荣戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，她是有可能跳过一公尺七十七公分这个高度的。
    一公尺七十三公分，这是一个新的高度，它不仅代表着我国女子跳高的新成绩，而且表明我国女子跳高的成绩更加接近了世界的纪录。
    人们期待着我国优秀的跳高运动员奔向更新的高度。（附图片）
