Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 21st (reporter Li Nan): In the forty years since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has transformed from a technologically backward country into an advanced nation possessing world-class technology. In recent years, the Soviet Union has been at the forefront of technological progress in production.

In recent years, many technological innovations and advancements in global industrial production have originated in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union not only holds the pioneering rights in jet engine manufacturing technology, rocket technology, and atomic energy technology, but also possesses numerous cutting-edge technological achievements in metallurgy, machinery, tools, chemical and other industrial sectors.

In metal processing, the "electro-spark method" invented by the Soviet Union in 1939 solved problems that could not be addressed by cutting methods. In thermal engineering, the high-frequency current method invented by the Soviet Union fundamentally changed thermal operations. Advanced technologies in welding, such as slag welding, were also invented by the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union has also made many beneficial innovations in the manufacturing of heavy machinery. The Soviet Union was the first to manufacture the "Donbass" coal mining combine, pioneering the mechanization of coal mining. Large cranes, excavators, dredgers, etc. manufactured by the Soviet Union have mechanized heavy construction work. In addition to inventing hydraulic coal mining, Soviet engineers also proposed advanced technology for underground coal gasification in 1934. This technology has led to the rapid development of the Soviet Union's gas industry. In the petroleum industry, the Soviet Union not only introduced many technological innovations in exploration and drilling, but also solved the problem of offshore oil extraction for the first time.

In the metallurgical industry, the super-capacity blast furnaces and oxygen-enriched steelmaking and ironmaking methods designed and built by Soviet technicians are advanced inventions. The Soviet Union is particularly advanced in the mechanization of heavy steelmaking and ironmaking labor. The vaporization cooling method for open-hearth furnaces, first adopted by the Soviet Union, has played an important role in shortening the repair time of open-hearth furnaces.

In the chemical industry, the synthetic rubber method invented by the Soviet Union completely solved the Soviet Union's rubber supply problem. Manufacturing plastics and oil gums from silicon-containing flint through synthesis is a promising industrial sector, and the basic production principles of this sector were laid by Soviet scientists.

Soviet industrial technology has undergone a glorious development path in the past forty years. Before the October Revolution, Russia's industrial technology was very backward. It lacked a complete machine manufacturing industry, and most of the machinery it needed had to be imported from abroad. The modernization of production equipment in its industries was far behind countries such as the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Thanks to the development of the Soviet machine manufacturing industry, the technological equipment of various industrial sectors in the Soviet Union has now been modernized and is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Many industrial sectors and enterprises are among the most technologically well-equipped and advanced in the world.

At the same time, with the encouragement of the Party and the government, technological progress and inventions in Soviet industry are increasingly taking on a mass character. According to archival materials, from 1814 to 1917, in the hundred years before the revolution, only over 36,000 patent rights were registered in all of Russia, and about 80% of them were invented by foreigners in Russia. However, in 1956, industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union had a total of more than 1.3 million people who proposed 2.37 million suggestions and inventions for improving production technology. These have powerfully promoted the rapid progress of Soviet industrial production technology.

Technological progress is an important indicator of Soviet industrial production during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The requirements of technological progress are reflected in the increased level of comprehensive mechanization and automation of industrial production. The Soviet Union is the first country to adopt automated production lines, which can increase labor productivity by two to nine times. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that the transition should be further made from individual automatic machines and automatic linkages to the complete automation of entire factories and workshops; television instruments should be widely used for remote management and high automation of production; and comprehensive mechanization should be implemented in relatively weak links, such as loading and unloading work. In the steel industry, forty steel rolling mills will be fully automated, and the operation of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces will be further automated. In the electric power industry, Soviet hydroelectric power stations are fully automated, and all thermal power stations will be fully automated during this five-year plan. During this five-year plan, 220 automated production lines or automated workshops will be installed in the machinery industry. Automated machines to be installed in the textile industry will account for 60% of all machines. The degree of production automation in the food industry will also be greatly improved. In addition, a large number of electronic instruments and television instruments will be produced during this five-year plan. The output of instruments specifically for managing and controlling production will increase threefold compared to the previous five-year plan.

Another important sign of Soviet technological progress during the Sixth Five-Year Plan is the rapid increase in electricity production and widespread electrification. By 1960, the national power generation will reach 320 billion kilowatt-hours, 188% of that in 1955. During the five-year plan period, a unified power grid in the European part will be established, a unified power grid for the three republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia will be established, and a unified power grid in Central Siberia from Irkutsk to Novosibirsk will be established.

During the new five-year plan period, emerging industries such as atomic energy, semiconductors, and jet engines will also be developed. The Soviet Union will widely use atomic energy in transportation and various industrial productions. These will all promote the leap forward of Soviet industrial technology.

    苏联工业拥有世界头等技术
    新的五年计划技术进步的标志是：全面机械化和自动化程度的提高；电力生产的迅速增加和广泛电气化；原子能、半导体、喷气发动机等新兴工业获得发展。
    新华社莫斯科21日电　本社记者李楠报道：苏联在十月革命后的四十年间已经从技术落后的国家一跃而为世界上拥有头等技术的先进国家。最近几年来，苏联在生产技术方面起着带头的作用。
    最近许多年来，世界工业生产中的许多技术革新和进步都是从苏联开始的。苏联不仅在喷气机制造技术、火箭技术、原子能技术等方面掌握了首创权，就是在冶金、机器、工具、化学等工业部门中也拥有许多技术上的最新成就。
    在金属加工方面，苏联1939年发明的“电火法”解决了用切削法无法加工的问题。在热工方面，苏联发明的高频率电流法根本上改变了热工的作业。电焊方面的先进技术如矿渣电焊法也是苏联发明的。
    在重型机器制造方面，苏联也有许多有益的创造。苏联首先制成了“顿巴斯”式采煤联合机，开辟了采煤工作机械化的道路。苏联制造的大型起重机、掘土机、汲泥船等使繁重的建筑工作走向机械化。除了发明水力采煤法以外，苏联工程技术界还曾经在1934年提出了使煤在地底下气化的先进技术。这个技术使苏联的煤气工业获得飞跃的发展。在石油工业方面，苏联不仅在勘探和钻井方面提出了许多技术革新方法，而且第一次解决了海上采油的问题。
    在冶金工业方面，苏联技术界设计和建造的超能力高炉以及富氧炼钢炼铁法都是先进的发明。在使繁重的炼钢炼铁劳动机械化方面，苏联尤为先进。它首先采用的平炉汽化冷却法对于缩短平炉的修理时间起了重要的作用。
    在化学工业方面，苏联发明的合成橡胶法完全解决了苏联的橡胶供应问题。利用含矽的燧石靠合成的方法制造塑料和油胶，是一门极有前途的工业部门，这一工业部门的基本生产原理也是苏联学者们奠定的。
    苏联的工业技术在四十年中经历了光荣的发展道路。十月革命以前，俄国的工业技术是非常落后的。它没有完整的机器制造工业，它所需要的大部分机器都要依靠外国进口，工业中的现代化生产装备要比美国、德国、英国等国差好多倍。由于苏联机器制造工业的发展，苏联各工业部门的技术装备现在已经现代化和日益完善，不少工业部门和企业甚至已经是全世界技术装备最完善、最先进的。
    同时，在党和政府的奖励下，苏联工业中的技术进步和技术发明日益带有群众性的规模。根据档案材料记载，在革命以前从1814年到1917年的一百多年间，全俄国登记发明专利权的只有三万六千多件，而且其中约80％还是在俄国的外国人发明的。然而，在1956年，苏联工业企业中共有一百三十多万人提出了二百三十七万件改进生产技术的建议和发明。这些都有力地促进了苏联工业生产技术的迅速进步。
    技术进步是第六个五年计划期间苏联工业生产的一个重要的指标。技术进步的要求表现在工业生产全面机械化和自动化程度的提高上面。苏联是首先采用自动化作业线的国家，自动化作业线可以将劳动生产率提高两倍到九倍。这个五年计划规定要进一步从个别的自动机器和自动联动机过渡到实现整个工厂和车间的完全自动化；要广泛采用电视仪器，以便对生产进行远距离管理和使生产高度自动化，要在较薄弱的环节，如装卸工作方面实行全面机械化。在钢铁工业方面，有四十部压钢机将要完全自动化，高炉和平炉的操作要进一步自动化。在电力工业方面，苏联水电站完全是自动化的，而在这个五年计划内还将使热电站全部自动化。在这个五年计划期间，要在机械工业中安装二百二十个自动化作业线或自动化车间。纺织工业中将安装的自动化机器将占全部机器的60％。食品工业的生产自动化程度也将大大提高。此外，在这个五年计划期间还将生产大批的电子仪器和电视仪器。专供管理和控制生产的仪器的产量将比前一个五年计划增加三倍。
    第六个五年计划苏联技术进步的另一个重要标志是电力生产的迅速增加和广泛电气化。到1960年，全国发电量将达到三千二百亿度，为1955年的188％。在五年计划期内，将建立统一欧洲部分电力网，将建立格鲁吉亚、阿塞拜疆、亚美尼亚三个共和国的统一电力网，并且将建立由伊尔库茨克到新西伯利亚的中央西伯利亚统一电力网。
    在新五年计划期间，原子能、半导体、喷气发动机等新兴的工业也将获得发展。苏联在交通运输和各项工业生产中都将广泛运用原子能。这些都将促使苏联工业技术的跃进。
