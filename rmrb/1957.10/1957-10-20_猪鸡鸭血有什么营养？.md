What are the Nutrients in Pig, Chicken and Duck Blood?
　　Pig, duck, and chicken blood are rich in iron, calcium, and protein, and are inexpensive and delicious.
　　Iron is the main component of hemoglobin in human red blood cells, and its deficiency leads to anemia. The amount of iron in animals is mostly found in the blood. Pig blood is particularly rich in iron, containing 15 milligrams per 100 grams, which is more than 30 times that of the same amount of pork. Chicken and duck blood contain slightly less, but still far more than chicken and duck meat.
　　Calcium is an important component of human bones and teeth. It can also increase the blood's clotting ability, preventing excessive blood loss when body tissues are damaged. Severe deficiency can lead to osteomalacia and rickets. Pig blood is particularly rich in calcium, containing 69 milligrams per 100 grams, which is more than six times that of the same amount of pork. Chicken and duck blood are similar to chicken and duck meat in calcium content, but are much cheaper.
　　The main function of protein is to promote human development and growth and to repair damaged cell tissues. Without it, and without replenishment, humans cannot survive. Pig blood contains 18.9% protein per 100 grams, which is still slightly more than the same amount of pork. Chicken and duck blood contain less protein than chicken and duck meat, but in terms of selling price, the former is still more cost-effective than the latter.

　　猪鸡鸭血有什么营养？
    猪、鸭、鸡血含有丰富的铁质、钙质、蛋白质，而且价钱便宜，味道美。
    铁质是人体红血球中血红素的主要成分，缺乏时要得贫血症。动物体中的铁质，存在于血液中的份量是很多的。猪血中铁质特别多，每百克中含十五毫克，超过同量猪肉达三十多倍。鸡、鸭血含量略小，但也远远超过鸡、鸭肉。
    钙质是构成人体骨骼、牙齿的重要成分，又能使血液增加凝结力，避免身体组织受破坏时失血过多，严重缺乏时会得软骨病和佝偻病。猪血中钙质又特别多，每百克含六十九毫克，等于同量猪肉的六倍还多。鸡、鸭血则与鸡、鸭肉相仿，但价钱却便宜很多。
    蛋白质的功用主要是促进人体的发育成长和修补被破坏了的细胞组织，缺少它而又得不到补充时，人是活不成的。猪血每百克含蛋白质18.9％，仍比同量猪肉多了一点。鸡、鸭血则是少于鸡、鸭肉，从卖价来看，前者仍比后者上算。
