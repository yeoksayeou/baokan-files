    Beijing Launches Campaign to Discourage Spitting

    (Our newspaper reports) The Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee is launching a campaign citywide to discourage spitting. The aim is to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, maintain environmental cleanliness, and cultivate good hygiene habits among citizens. Currently, some districts have mobilized Red Cross members and primary and secondary school students to form propaganda teams, conducting promotional activities and distributing leaflets with the message "Please Do Not Spit" on the streets, in public places, and on trams and buses. Mobile broadcasting vehicles are conducting巡回宣传 (xun hui xuan chuan)touring propaganda in urban areas. Some government offices, schools, shops, and canteens have also posted slogans and pictures.

    Spitting is a bad habit that has been left over from the old society for a long time, harming both oneself and others. To eliminate it, in addition to regular publicity from relevant departments, every citizen should consciously abide by this virtue—no longer spitting and advising others to do the same.

    北京开展劝止随地吐痰运动
    本报讯　北京市爱国卫生运动委员会正在全市开展劝止随地吐痰运动，目的是防止呼吸道疾病的传播，保持环境清洁，并使市民养成良好的卫生习惯。目前有些区发动了红十字会会员、中小学生组成宣传队，在街道上、公共场所、电车和公共汽车上，进行宣传活动和散发“请勿随地吐痰”的传单。流动广播宣传车在城区作巡回宣传。有些机关、学校和商店、食堂，还张贴了标语和图片。
    随地吐痰是旧社会长时期遗留下来的一种坏习惯，害人害己。要消灭它，除了有关部门经常宣传外，每一个公民都应自觉地遵守这种美德——不再随地吐痰，并劝告旁人也这样做。（甸义）
