　　Artificial Satellite Passes Over Moscow Ten Times
    Soviet People Filled with Pride
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th - The Soviet people continue to watch the flight of the artificial satellite with great interest. This morning at 5:17, the artificial satellite passed over Moscow for the tenth time.
    The Soviet people link this scientific achievement of launching the artificial satellite with their own work, and they are filled with pride in the achievements of science and labor. Steelworker Kluyev of the "Hammer and Sickle" factory said, "As I watch the fiery steel, I am happy to think that the creation of the artificial satellite also has a share of my labor and the labor of all Soviet steelworkers." Zotov, a subway tunnel worker, said, "Workers building new roads underground are even more encouraged and proud when they think that Soviet people are laying roads in the sky."
    Many Soviet scholars have pointed out that science and mankind have now entered a new era. Writer Kazantsev wrote that what many fantasists have written has become reality. Now is the time for them to predict newer discoveries.
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th - According to TASS: As of October 11, the artificial Earth satellite had orbited the Earth more than one hundred times, traveling approximately 4.4 million kilometers. Scientific stations, observatories, radio direction-finding stations, radar stations, and radio enthusiasts in various places continue to successfully observe the satellite's operation. When the carrier rocket passed over Moscow on the morning of the 11th, it was clearly visible to the naked eye, and the observatory also saw the satellite.
    The results of studying optical and radio measurement data show that due to the different resistance of the satellite and the carrier rocket in the atmosphere and other factors, their operating cycles are different, and the relative distance between the satellite and the carrier rocket is changing.

　　人造卫星十次路过莫斯科
    苏联人民满怀自豪
    新华社莫斯科11日电　苏联人民继续以极大的兴趣注视人造卫星的飞行情况。今天早晨五点十七分人造卫星第十次通过了莫斯科上空。
    苏联人民把放射人造卫星这一科学成就同自己的工作连系起来，他们充满了对科学和劳动成就的自豪感。“镰刀与锤子”工厂的炼钢工人克卢耶夫说，我注视着火红的钢水，就欣然地想到人造卫星的创造也有我自己和全体苏联钢铁工人的一分劳动。地下铁道掘进工人佐托夫说，在地下建设着新道路的工人们想到苏维埃人正在高空铺设道路的时候，就更加感到鼓舞和骄傲。
    许多苏联学者都指出，现在科学和人类已经进入了新的时代。作家卡藏切夫写道，许多幻想家们所写的东西已经成为现实。现在是他们去预测更新的发现的时候了。
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社报道：到10月11日为止，人造地球卫星已经绕地球运行了一百多圈，行程约四百四十万公里。各地科学站、天文台、无线电测向站、雷达站和无线电爱好者继续顺利地观测到卫星的运行。11日晨运载火箭过莫斯科时，用肉眼看得很清楚，天文台还看到了卫星。
    研究光学和无线电测量资料的结果表明，由于卫星和运载火箭在大气中所受的阻力不同和其他因素，它们的运转周期有差别，卫星和运载火箭之间的相对距离正在发生变化。
