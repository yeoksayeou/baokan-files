　　Sincerely Thanking Soviet Experts for Their Help
　　Gu Maoxun, Chief Engineer of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau

　　The 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution is fast approaching. On this universally joyous festival, I would like to express my heartfelt sincere congratulations on this great festival with excitement, based on my personal experience of the influence of Soviet experts on me since liberation, gleaning fragments of memory and writing this article.

　　When the spearhead of the great Liberation War in 1949 pointed directly at Hangzhou, a famous scenic area in southern China, I was working at the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau. I was already over fifty years old, with graying temples. Half a year after liberation, I was transferred from Zhejiang-Jiangxi to work at the Ministry of Railways, where I first had the pleasure of meeting Soviet expert General Kingoring. Our meeting was to exchange preliminary views on reinforcing the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge. The impression this meeting gave me was that Soviet experts were very amiable and approachable in their attitude towards people, and very realistic in their handling of technical issues. On the issue of the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge, our opinions finally moved from disagreement to unity after this discussion. Where was the disagreement? Initially, because I had not seen the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge in the years from the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan to the victory of the Liberation War, and I had a bad impression of this old bridge as early as the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I therefore had a preconceived notion about it. I believed that this bridge was not strong when it was first built, and after more than fifty years of testing, coupled with years of military damage and poor maintenance, this old bridge should be approaching obsolescence and the end of its life. Reinforcing and renovating it seemed unnecessary. The Soviet expert's opinion was exactly the opposite of mine. After being invited to China, he had visited the bridge and, after on-the-spot investigations, he believed that the bridge could still be reinforced and renovated. He believed that when the military was newly established and the country's vitality had not yet recovered, China should not extravagantly talk about building new bridges. On the contrary, it should try to reinforce and utilize existing things as much as possible under the condition of not spending a lot of labor and materials, so as to make the best use of everything and exert the potential power of all favorable factors. This noble spirit of cherishing China's property as if it were their own gave me an extremely vivid and profound education. Someone said, "Hearing your words is better than reading books for ten years." The educational significance of Kingong's (I would like to respectfully call General Kingoring) remarks to me was like this! I deeply felt at the time that Soviet experts who had mastered Marxism-Leninism were essentially different from American experts who were dedicated to seizing by force. If it were an American expert, he would not have proposed reinforcing and renovating the bridge at all. Is this statement an overstatement? No, there is no exaggeration at all. Didn't engineers from the American Morrison Knudsen Company come to China to see this bridge a year or two before liberation? What opinions did they put forward? They unhesitatingly sentenced the old bridge to death. At the same time, in order to find a profitable business, they asked the reactionary government of China at that time to pay a price of 100,000 US dollars to go to the United States to design a new bridge. Their demands were certainly met at the time, but their intention was not only to obtain this very high design fee, but also to hope that the reactionary government of China at that time would ask them to take over the construction of this bridge, thereby plundering the Chinese people. The sound of the guns of the Liberation War destroyed their dreams. Such dreams will never be realized again in our independent and self-reliant New China!

　　After General Kingoring talked to me, the Ministry of Railways assigned me to lead the design work for this reinforcement. The deadline for this design was very tight. In this work, because I personally went to the site twice and did some diligent work of "burning the midnight oil," I was able to put forward the reinforcement plan in time, which was agreed and praised by Kingong. I was rewarded by the Ministry of Railways for this, and this old bridge, which was more than fifty years old, was successfully reinforced and completed under this design without spending a lot of labor and materials.

　　This contact with Soviet experts in work gave me a profound education. From then on, I unswervingly established the spirit of thrift and opposing waste. No wonder, when the state put forward the slogan of thrift and opposition to waste in 1955, I was able to propose a revised design plan for several overpass bridges on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River Bridge, thereby saving the state more than 600,000 yuan in investment. The origin of this small contribution I made is closely related to the education Kingong gave me on the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge issue. Of course, when I made this suggestion, Comrade Rudenko, the Soviet expert of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, also gave me direct support and help, which should also be stated here.

　　Soviet experts are very amiable and approachable in their treatment of people, and at the same time, they are full of emotion. I can still clearly recall the following example. In the early spring of 1950, when I accompanied the Soviet expert group headed by Kingong to Wuhan to survey the bridge site of the Yangtze River Bridge and inspect the simple railway ferry at that time, I was deeply praised by Kingong because I made more detailed specific calculations on increasing the transportation capacity of the ferry, and the conclusions were more correct. One day, he gave me an extremely intimate hug in the hall of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Guest House on Chen Huaimin Road in Hankou in front of a large crowd! This expression of sincere friendship is unforgettable for me personally.

　　In short, the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is not just lip service, but is deeply rooted and flourishing in the hearts of the people of our two great nations. The promotion of this great friendship will be one of the main driving forces for China to build a socialist society, and on the other hand, it will also be a source for laying the foundation for world peace and liberating mankind. I would like to take this opportunity of the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution to wish the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people a long life!

### 衷心感激苏联专家对我的帮助

　　衷心感激苏联专家对我的帮助
　　武汉长江大桥工程局总工程师　顾懋勋
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年转瞬就要来到了。在这样一个举世欢腾的节日里，我谨以满怀兴奋的情绪，就我在解放以后所切身感受的苏联专家对我的熏陶，摭拾东鳞西爪，撰成本文，用以表达我个人对这伟大节日衷心的诚挚祝贺。
    当伟大的解放战争的矛头在1949年直指我国江南名胜地区——杭州的时候，我正在浙赣铁路局工作。我当时已是两鬓渐霜年逾半百的人了。解放半年后，从浙赣奉调至铁道部工作，我第一次欣遇苏联专家金戈林克将军。我们的会晤是为加固郑州黄河桥而交换初步意见的。这次会晤所给我的印象是：苏联专家待人接物的态度是十分和蔼可亲的，对于技术问题的处理是实事求是的。在郑州黄河桥的问题上，经过这次会谈，我们的意见终于由分歧而得到统一了。分歧何在呢？起初，由于从抗战胜利到解放战争胜利的几年中，我没有看到过郑州黄河桥，而早在抗战开始的时候，我对这座老桥的印象就是很坏的，因此我对它有先入为主的看法。我认为，这座大桥开始修建时就并不牢固，经过五十多年的时间考验，加以连年军事破坏，维修不善，这座老桥应是接近报废和就木之年了，加固复新，好像大可不必。苏联专家的意见恰好和我相反。他在应邀来到我国以后，曾经一度去看过这座桥，经过实地考察，他认为这座桥还是可以加固复新的。他认为，在军事刚才大定国家元气尚未恢复的时候，我国不应侈谈修建新桥，相反的，应该尽可能地在不费很多工料的条件下，尽量加固和利用现有的东西，以便物尽其力，用尽其材，从而发挥一切有利因素的潜在力量。这种爱惜我国财产如同爱惜其本国财产的崇高的国际主义精神，给我一个极为生动而深刻的教育。有人说：“听君一席话，胜读十年书”。金公（我想这样来尊称金戈林克将军）的谈话对我的教育意义就是如此！我当时深深感到，掌握马列主义的苏联专家确是和以强取豪夺为职志的美国专家有本质上的区别。如换一个美国专家，他是根本不会提出加固复新的意见的。这种说法是不是过火呢？不，这一点也没有过甚其词。在解放前不过一两年，美国的莫礼逊克努生公司的工程师不是也曾来我国看过这座桥吗？他们提出些什么意见呢？他们毫不犹豫地判死了这座老桥，同时，为了找一笔赚钱的生意，他们要求我国当时的反动政府以十万美元的代价到美国去作一新桥的设计。他们的要求在当时当然得到了满足，但是，醉翁之意不在酒，他们的欲望不仅在于取得这一笔很高的设计费，而是希望我国当时的反动政府请他们来包办代替地修建这座大桥，从而掠夺我国人民。解放战争的炮声，摧毁了他们的梦想。这种梦想在我们独立自主的新中国，是永远不会再有实现的可能了！
    在金戈林克将军和我谈话之后，铁道部就指派我领导这项加固设计的工作。这项设计限期很紧。在这项工作中，由于我曾两次亲赴现场做了些“焚膏油以继晷”的黾勉工作，从而及时地提出了加固方案，得到了金公的同意和揄扬，我为此曾受到铁道部的奖励，而这座五十多年的老桥也就按照这一设计，在不费多少工料的条件下，胜利加固完成。
    这一次和苏联专家在工作上的接触，给我的教育是意义深长的。我从此坚定不移地树立了勤俭节约、反对浪费的精神。无怪，在1955年国家提出节约和反对浪费的口号时，我就能对长江大桥的几座武昌岸的跨线桥提出修改设计的方案，从而为国家节约投资六十余万元。我本人所作出的这一纤细的贡献，追其根源，是和当初金公在郑州黄河大桥问题上所给我的教育息息相关的。当然，在提出这一建议的时候，武汉长江大桥工程局的苏联专家鲁登科同志还曾给我直接的支持和帮助，这里也应一并予以表明。
    苏联专家，在待人接物方面是非常和蔼可亲的，同时，他们是富于情感的。我现在还能清楚地回忆下面的一个例子。当1950年初春，我随金公为首的苏联专家小组到武汉勘察长江大桥桥址、视察当时简陋的铁路轮渡时，由于我在增加轮渡运输能力的具体计算上作得较为详尽，得出的结论较为正确，就深得金公的赞许。他有一天，曾在汉口陈怀民路郑州铁路局招待所里在大厅广众中对我作了极为亲密的拥抱！这种真挚友谊的表现，对我个人是毕生难忘的。
    总之，中苏两国人民间的兄弟般的友谊不是停留在口头上，而是根深蒂固地繁荣滋长在我们两大民族的人民内心深处的。这一伟大友谊的发扬光大，一方面将是我国建成社会主义社会的主要动力之一，而另一方面，也将是奠定世界和平和解放世界人类的主要动力的一个源泉。我谨乘此伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的机会，祝苏中两国人民之间的伟大友谊万岁！
