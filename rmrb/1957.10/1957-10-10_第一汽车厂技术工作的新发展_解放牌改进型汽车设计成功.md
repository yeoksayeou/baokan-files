    New Developments in Technical Work at the First Automotive Works
    Improved Jiefang Truck Design Successful

    This newspaper reports that the First Automotive Works plans to manufacture a prototype of an improved Jiefang truck by the end of this year. The design work for this truck has been completed. Its performance is relatively good, with a speed of 75 kilometers per hour and 110 horsepower. It has a carrying capacity of four tons. It uses 550 kilograms less steel and other materials than the existing Jiefang truck.

    The successful design of this improved truck marks a new development in the technical work of the First Automotive Works. Designing new cars is not an easy task. Although China can manufacture cars, it is not yet able to independently design new ones. The Jiefang truck was based on the Soviet ZIS-150 model. Now, the plant's designers have begun designing another improved truck with a carrying capacity of five tons, and the general layout diagram is almost complete. At the same time, the entire plant has begun preparations to learn how to design new vehicles as soon as possible, with the aim of designing new vehicles such as trailers, off-road vehicles, and small cars at an early date.

    第一汽车厂技术工作的新发展
    解放牌改进型汽车设计成功
    本报讯　第一汽车厂计划在今年年底制造出一种解放牌改进型汽车的样车。这种汽车的设计工作，已经完成。它的性能比较好，时速是七十五公里，马力是一百一十。载重量四吨。它比解放牌汽车可少用五百五十公斤钢材和其他材料。
    这种改进型汽车设计的成功，标志着第一汽车厂技术工作的新发展。设计新汽车，不是轻而易举的事情。我国虽然能够制造汽车，但是还不能独立设计出新车。解放牌汽车就是采用苏联吉斯一五○型汽车为范本的。现在全厂设计人员又开始设计另一种载重量五吨的改进型汽车，并且快要做好总布置图。同时，全厂开始做好准备工作，争取早日学会新车的设计，提早设计出拖车、越野车、小汽车等新车。
