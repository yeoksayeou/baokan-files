The employees of the International Bookstore have been engaged in a resolute rational struggle with the rightists in the store for more than two months, exposing their attempt to restore China's book import and export trade to the old capitalist road.

Wang Fushi, the rightist deputy director of the Import Department of the International Bookstore, a man who has always claimed to have been "close to the Party for more than 20 years," colluded with the rightist Xiao Qian during the period of "blooming and contending" to publish an article in the eighth issue of the "Literary Gazette" under the pseudonym Si Tuyan. The article smeared the work achievements of the International Bookstore, falsely accusing the International Bookstore of being not a "bridge" but a "wall" in international cultural exchange, and even several walls. He also gathered two other rightists in the store, Yu Ruxin and Xu Guangzhu, and co-opted some cadres to visit the rightists Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang, asking them to appeal at the National People's Congress, and volunteered to propose that the International Bookstore should add a "business-minded" deputy manager, attempting to usurp the leadership of the International Bookstore.

In his articles and speeches, Wang Fushi put forward his consistently adhered-to capitalist business line, demanding that measures be taken to create conditions for the reactionary books of capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States to flood freely in China. He even secretly planned to establish an import and export bookstore without the leadership of the Party, jointly operated by public and private sectors, attempting to compete with the International Bookstore.

At several meetings, the employees of the International Bookstore refuted Wang Fushi's rightist words and deeds with a large number of facts. In fact, the book import work of the International Bookstore has achieved great achievements under the correct guidance of the Party and the government in recent years. Through the import of books and periodicals from all over the world, especially the large-scale distribution of Soviet books and periodicals, it has played an extremely important bridge role in promoting China's economic construction, cultural construction, and international cultural exchange, which cannot be erased by any rightist. For example, the Chengdu Railway Department referred to the design experience of the Soviet book "Bridge Construction," which not only saved the country one million and several hundred thousand yuan in wealth, but also greatly shortened the construction time. Similar examples are numerous.

The International Bookstore's import of books and periodicals from capitalist countries has also been coordinated with the needs of national construction and people's cultural life, and planned imports have been carried out to appropriately meet some necessary book materials. This is proved by the number of books imported from capitalist countries in 1957, which will be six times that of 1953, and the foreign exchange paid will increase eight times. In 1951, the International Bookstore's import department had dealings with 119 counterparts in 21 countries, and in 1957 it increased to 371 counterparts in 35 countries. The International Bookstore adopts the policy of accepting entrustment from various agencies, groups, and readers for handling affairs on their behalf, supplemented by active procurement, in its business of importing books and periodicals from capitalist countries. This ensures that the imported books and periodicals can truly meet the needs of national socialist construction and people's cultural life. However, Wang Fushi described the planned import as "rigid rules and regulations" and deliberately advocated free ordering and free import.

After three months of anti-rightist struggle, all the employees of the International Bookstore have generally improved their ideological understanding. Those employees who used to "only care about business and not politics" have actively taken action and are determined to wage a resolute struggle against the rightists.

### 王福时等妄想篡夺国际书店领导权  职工们以事实驳倒他的谬论

    王福时等妄想篡夺国际书店领导权
    职工们以事实驳倒他的谬论
    本报讯　国际书店职工两个多月来与该店的右派分子展开了坚决的说理斗争，揭露了他们企图使我国图书进出口贸易恢复到资本主义的老路上去。
    国际书店进口部副主任右派分子王福时，这个一向以“靠近党二十余年”自居的人，在鸣放期间，勾结右派分子萧乾用司徒言的化名在文艺报第八期发表文章，抹杀国际书店的工作成绩，诬蔑国际书店在国际文化交流中不像“桥”而是“墙”，而且是几道墙。他还纠合该店另外两个右派分子于汝昕、徐广柱，拉拢部分干部访问了右派分子曾昭抡和钱伟长，要他们在全国人代会上呼吁，并毛遂自荐，提出国际书店应增加一个“懂业务”的副经理，企图篡夺国际书店的领导权。
    王福时在他的文章和言论中，提出了他一贯坚持的资本主义经营路线，要求采取措施，创造条件，以便使英美等资本主义国家的反动图书在我国自由泛滥。他甚至暗中筹划成立一个不要党的领导，公私合营的进出口书店，企图与国际书店唱对台戏。
    国际书店职工在几次会上，用大量事实批驳了王福时的右派言行。事实上国际书店的图书进口工作几年来在党和政府的正确的方针指导下，取得了很大成就。通过世界各国书刊的进口，特别是苏联书刊的大量发行，在推动我国经济建设、文化建设和国际文化交流等方面都起了极其重大的桥梁作用，这是任何右派分子抹杀不了的。例如：成都铁路部门参照了苏联“桥梁建筑”一书的设计经验，不仅为国家节约了一百几十万元财富，还大大缩短了建筑的时间。类似的事例是不胜枚举的。
    国际书店对资本主义国家书刊的进口，也配合了国家建设和人民文化生活的需要，进行有计划的进口，使一些必需的图书资料得到适当的满足。从进口资本主义国家书刊的数量和国家支付的外汇来看就证明了这一点。如1957年进口资本主义国家书的数量将是1953年的六倍，支付的外汇将增长八倍。国际书店进口部门与资本主义国家往来的同业1951年是二十一个国家一百一十九家同业，1957年增加到三十五个国家三百七十一家同业。国际书店在进口资本主义国家书刊的业务上是采取接受各机关、团体、读者委托代办为主，主动进货为辅的方针。使进口的书刊真正能保证国家社会主义建设和人民文化生活的需要。但是王福时却把有计划的进口，说成是“清规戒律”，别有用心地主张自由订货，自由进口。
    国际书店的全体职工，经过三个月的反右派斗争，普遍提高了思想认识，过去那些“只管业务，不问政治”的职工们，纷纷积极行动起来，要与右派分子进行坚决的斗争。
