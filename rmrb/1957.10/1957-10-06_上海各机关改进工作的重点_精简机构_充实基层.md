Shanghai Organs Improve Work Focus: Streamlining Institutions, Strengthening the Grassroots

(Our Dispatch) Streamlining institutions and strengthening the grassroots are key tasks in Shanghai's organs' recent "rectification and reform while working." In the great blooming and contending within the organs, the bloated and unreasonable nature of the institutions, overstaffing, and the weakness of grassroots strength were among the most concentrated issues of everyone's opinions. At present, leaders of some organs have resolutely begun to improve them. The Shanghai Municipal District People's Committees have recently abolished unnecessary industrial and statistical sections. Municipal-level institutions such as the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and the Health Bureau have devolved some powers to the districts in order to overcome bureaucratic work styles. In addition, the long-discussed division of labor plan between the municipality and the districts has been finalized after repeated consultations between the municipal and district organs, which will henceforth improve the phenomenon of some organs shirking responsibility in their work due to unclear division of labor.

At the same time, some organs have also cleared up and reduced various avoidable reports to reduce the burden on the grassroots. The textile company under the First Commercial Bureau has cleaned up the reports within the company, reducing the original 334 types to 262 types, which can save more than 26,000 work hours per month.

The leadership style of some organs has also improved. Going deep into the lower levels and into reality has become a common phenomenon among Shanghai's Deputy Mayors and leaders of various units. For several months, the Party Committee and leading cadres of the Municipal Engineering Bureau have generally insisted on participating in physical labor at the lower levels and on construction sites. In the past, the Party Committee of this bureau often studied the annual plan drafted by the Planning Section behind closed doors. Recently, when drafting the 1958 plan, the Party Committee members went deep into the lower levels to study whether the various engineering projects in the plan were practical and feasible, and supplemented and modified them, making the plan more realistic.

    上海各机关改进工作的重点
    精简机构　充实基层
    本报讯　精简机构、充实基层，这是上海市机关最近“边整边改”中的一项重点工作。在机关内部的大鸣大放中，机构庞大和不合理、人浮于事、基层力量薄弱，是大家意见最集中的问题之一。目前一部分机关领导上已坚决着手加以改进。上海市各区人民委员会最近已撤销了不必要的工业科和统计科。上海市教育局、卫生局等市级机构为了克服官僚主义作风，已把一部分权力下放各区。此外，酝酿已久的市、区分工方案，经过市、区机关反复协商，现在已经确定，从此将可以改善有些机关因分工不明确在工作中互相推诿的现象。
    与此同时，有些机关还清理并减少各种可省的报表，减轻基层的负担。第一商业局所属的纺织品公司对公司内的报表进行了清理，将原有的三百三十四种减少到二百六十二种，这样每月可以节省劳动力二万六千多个工时。
    有些机关的领导作风也有了改进。深入下层、深入实际，在上海市副市长和各单位领导人员中已成为普遍的现象。市政工程局的党委和领导干部们几个月来一般都坚持了到下层和工地参加体力劳动。这个局的党委过去往往是关门研究计划科拟订的年度计划，最近拟订1958年计划时，党委委员们深入到下层去研究计划中的各项工程项目是否切实可行，加以补充修改，使计划更加切合实际。
