Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th – In the rectification and socialist education movement, factories and enterprises in Shenyang City have been vigorously improving their work, further promoting the airing of views (ming fang) by workers to develop in depth.

Some factories that started airing views earlier have already analyzed, summarized, and sorted out the opinions raised by workers, and after investigation and research, have formulated some plans to improve work, further guiding workers to展开 in-depth discussions. The Shenyang Screw Factory has formulated a plan to reduce management cadres by more than one-half based on the criticisms and suggestions of the masses, and submitted it to all workers in the factory for discussion. The Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory's plan for streamlining the organization is attracting all workers in the factory to展开 in-depth airing of views around this topic. In just one day, workers have raised more than 1,260 opinions on this plan.

Some factories that started the rectification movement later have pushed the airing of views to a climax due to the leadership's rapid and resolute improvement of work. The leading cadres of the Shenyang Smelting Plant announced at the workers' representative meeting that all but three of the 1,187 opinions raised in the past period have been resolved. After hearing this good news, the worker representatives couldn't even bother to go home for dinner, and rushed back to their workshops or offices to immediately write big-character posters. In a short while, more than 740 big-character posters were posted. Zhao Anzhou, a worker in the lead electrolysis workshop, was so happy to see that the big-character posters posted on the "Improvement Garden" the day before had all been addressed that he wrote more than a dozen big-character posters, raising fifteen criticisms and suggestions.

Vigorously improving work not only promoted the airing of views to a climax, but also promoted continuous improvement in production, specifically implementing the policy of "no delay in both rectification and production." After seeing the workers criticize the technical personnel for not going deep into the workshops to help solve problems, the leading cadres of the Technology Section of the Shenyang Steel Rolling Plant quickly organized technical personnel to take practical actions to show their determination to accept criticism, helping the Third Workshop solve the problem of the roll pass design, which greatly increased the output of rolled round steel.

    沈阳一些工矿企业
    坚决改进工作推动鸣放
    新华社沈阳12日电　沈阳市工厂企业在整风和社会主义教育运动中，由于狠狠地改进工作，进一步推动职工大鸣大放向深透发展。
    一些鸣放开始较早的工厂，已经把职工提出的意见分析、归纳、整理起来，并经过调查、研究制订出改进工作的某些方案，进一步引导职工展开讨论。沈阳螺钉厂根据群众的批评和建议，已经制订出精减管理干部二分之一以上的方案，交给全厂职工讨论。沈阳矿山机器厂制订的精减机构方案，正在吸引着全厂职工围绕着这个专题展开深入的鸣放，只一天的时间职工们就对这个方案提出一千二百六十多条意见。
    整风开始较晚的一些工厂，由于领导方面迅速坚决地改进工作，已经把鸣放推向高潮。沈阳冶炼厂的领导干部在职工代表大会上宣布：过去一个时期提出的一千一百八十七条意见，除只剩下三条外，已经全部解决。职工代表们听到这个喜讯后，都顾不及回家吃饭，纷纷跑回车间或科室，立刻写起大字报来，不一会就贴出了七百四十多张大字报。铅电解车间工人赵安周，从“改进园地”上看见头一天贴出的大字报都有着落，高兴得又写了十几张大字报提出十五条批评和建议。
    狠狠地改进工作，不仅推动鸣放进入高潮，并且推动生产不断提高，具体贯彻了整风生产两不误的方针。沈阳轧钢厂技术科领导干部，看见工人们批评技术人员不深入车间帮助解决问题以后，便迅速组织技术人员以实际行动表示接受批评的决心，帮助三车间解决了轧辊的孔型问题，使轧圆钢的产量大大提高。
