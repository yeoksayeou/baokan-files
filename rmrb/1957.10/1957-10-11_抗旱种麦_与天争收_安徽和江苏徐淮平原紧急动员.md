Fighting Drought to Plant Wheat: Striving for Harvest Against the Heavens
Emergency Mobilization in Anhui and the Xu-Huai Plains of Jiangsu

Our Correspondent, Hefei, 10th: The people of Anhui are fully engaged in the battle against drought to plant wheat.

Anhui is one of China's major wheat-producing areas. The current drought is severe, and approximately 30 million mu of wheat land needs drought relief before planting, accounting for more than 50% of the autumn planting area. In order to combat drought and seize the planting season, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee issued an urgent directive, requiring all localities to make drought relief and wheat planting the overriding central task at present. All water-lifting tools from government offices, schools, enterprises, and the military should be used to support drought relief, and technical personnel should go to the countryside with the tools. Because the drought situation is particularly serious in Huaibei, the main wheat-producing area, the directive requires that while making every effort to combat drought and plant wheat in Huaibei, the area for planting wheat should be expanded in Huainan and Jiangnan using all possible land to compensate for losses caused by the drought. Regarding the "airing views" work in rural areas, it can generally be suspended for half a month in Huaibei and areas with severe drought in Huainan, while in areas with less severe drought in Huainan, "airing views" and planting wheat should continue simultaneously. To support farmers in planting wheat in a timely manner, the directive requires government offices, enterprises, and military units to send a certain number of personnel to the countryside to help the masses plant wheat.

Now, all parts of Anhui have taken urgent action. Nearly 10,000 cadres from provincial-level government offices, Hefei municipal government offices, and the military will go to the countryside to help plant wheat. The first batch of 3,000 people went to Feidong County, Feixi County, and the suburbs of Hefei on the 9th. These cadres going to the countryside brought their own luggage and food ration certificates, and they will eat, live, and work with the farmers. They also brought water-lifting tools as much as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th: Agricultural cooperatives in the Xu-Huai Plain wheat-producing area of Jiangsu are organizing members to fight drought and preserve soil moisture to rush-plant winter wheat.

The Xuzhou and Huaiyin special districts have a total of 20 million mu of wheat fields. Due to lack of rain for nearly fifty days, the fields are generally dry, affecting autumn plowing and planting. The Xuzhou and Huaiyin Prefectural Committees of the Chinese Communist Party have mobilized forces and called on the masses to "fight drought and sow seeds, and compete with nature for harvest." Under the leadership of the CCP organizations, agricultural cooperatives in various townships are uniformly planning water sources and implementing wheat planting with water. In the Huaiyin area, 4 million mu have been sown out of 11.1 million mu of autumn fields. In Guanyun County, half of the 1.4 million mu of wheat fields have been sown, and the wheat field sowing can be completed by the 15th of this month. Cadres in Shuyang County proposed that each person dig half a mu to one mu of land to help agricultural cooperatives overcome the difficulty of cultivating the land. Every day, more than 10,000 cadres and masses throughout the county are digging land, breaking up soil clods to preserve moisture, and watering to plant wheat. (Picture attached)

　　抗旱种麦　与天争收
    安徽和江苏徐淮平原紧急动员
    本报合肥10日电　安徽人民全力投入了抗旱种麦的斗争。
    安徽是我国主要产麦区之一，目前旱情严重，需要抗旱下种的麦地约有三千万亩，占秋种面积的50％以上。为了抗旱抢种，中共安徽省委和省人民委员会特发出紧急指示，要求各地把抗旱种麦作为当前压倒一切的中心任务。所有机关、学校、企业、军队的提水工具都要拿出来支援抗旱，技术人员也随工具下乡。由于主要麦产区——淮北的旱情特别严重，要求在淮北尽力抗旱种麦的同时，在淮南、江南应利用一切可能利用的土地扩大种麦面积，以弥补因旱情造成的损失。关于农村“鸣放”工作，在淮北以及淮南旱情严重的地区，一般可暂停半月，在淮南旱情不严重的地区则仍边“鸣放”边种麦。为了支援农民适时种麦，指示要求机关、企业、部队抽出一定人员，下乡帮助群众种麦。
    现在安徽各地已经紧急行动起来。省级机关、合肥市各机关干部和部队将有近万人下乡帮助种麦。第一批三千人已于9日前往肥东县、肥西县和合肥市郊区。这批下乡干部都自带行李、粮证，和农民同吃同住同劳动，他们还尽可能携带了提水工具。
    新华社南京9日电　江苏产麦区徐淮平原上的农业社，正组织社员抗旱保墒，抢种冬麦。
    徐州、淮阴两专区共有麦田二千万亩。近五十天来由于缺雨，田地普遍干旱，影响秋耕秋种。中共徐州地委和淮阴地委已动员力量，号召群众“抗旱播种，与天争收”。各乡农业社在中共组织领导下统一规划水源，实行带水种麦。淮阴专区一千一百万亩秋田已经播下四百万亩。灌云县一百四十多万亩麦田已有一半播种，到这个月15日，麦田播种就可以全部结束。沭阳县机关干部提出每人挖地半亩到一亩，帮助农业社克服田地难耕的困难。每天，全县有一万多个干部和群众在一起挖地、打土块保墒，浇水种麦。（附图片）
