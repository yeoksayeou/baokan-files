    To Prepare Conditions for the Implementation of a Phonetic Script
    Work on Popularizing Putonghua is Underway
    (Our report) Since the National Language Reform Conference in October 1955 resolved to promote Putonghua (Standard Mandarin Chinese), and since the State Council issued the "Directive on Promoting Putonghua" in February 1956, significant progress has been made in promoting Putonghua across the country. The central government and twenty-four provinces and cities have established Putonghua Promotion Committees to advance this work. The "Beijing Phonetics Research Class," jointly run by the Ministry of Education and the Academy of Sciences, has already held its fourth session, training 541 core personnel for Putonghua promotion in various provinces and cities. As of the end of July this year, 600,285 primary and secondary school teachers across the country had received Putonghua phonetics training, accounting for slightly more than one-third of the total number of language teachers. Since the autumn of 1956, most primary and secondary schools and normal schools have begun using Putonghua to teach language classes. The Putonghua phonetics broadcast lectures and reading broadcasts organized by the central and provincial/municipal people's broadcasting stations are estimated to have been listened to and studied by more than two million teachers and people from all walks of life. More than 4.5 million copies of Putonghua textbooks and reference books have been published, and 1.38 million records for learning Putonghua have been issued. The preliminary survey of dialects in various provinces, except for a few provinces that will be extended to next year, will generally be completed by the end of this year.
    More than 80% of the teachers in the phonetics training classes run by provinces and cities can serve as lecturers or instructors in county and city training classes after receiving three to five weeks of intensive training. More than 70% of the primary and secondary school teachers trained in various counties and cities can use Beijing pronunciation to pronounce, spell, and read texts. Teachers' use of Putonghua for teaching is very popular with students.
    Due to insufficient publicity about the promotion of Putonghua, the political significance of promoting Putonghua has not been fully understood by all sectors of society, and has not aroused the attention and support of all parties. Therefore, the promotion of Putonghua is uneven. However, after the Ministry of Education and the Language Reform Committee jointly convened relevant meetings, the situation in which leaders in various provinces and cities did not pay enough attention has gradually been reversed. During the summer vacation, Beijing, Guangxi, Henan and other provinces and cities held Putonghua phonetics training classes. The Hebei Provincial Department of Education has initially drafted a work plan for promoting Putonghua in various levels and types of schools; Shaanxi Province is organizing teachers to listen to the Putonghua phonetics teaching broadcast organized by the province's radio station.

    为实行拼音文字准备条件
    推广普通话工作正在开展
    本报讯　从1955年10月全国文字改革会议决议推广普通话，1956年2月国务院发出了“关于推广普通话的指示”以来，全国各地推广普通话工作取得了显著成绩。中央和二十四个省、市已经设立了推广普通话工作委员会来推进这项工作。教育部和科学院共同举办的
  “北京语音研究班”已经办了第四期，为各省、市培养了五百四十一名推广普通话的骨干。到今年7月底为止，全国已经有六十万零二千八百五十二个中、小学教师受过普通话语音训练，约占语文教师总数的三分之一强。从1956年秋季开始，大多数中、小学和师范学校的语文课已经开始用普通话教学。中央和各省、市人民广播电台举办的普通话语音广播讲座和朗读广播，估计有二百万以上的教师和其他各界人士收听和学习。已经出版的普通话教材和参考书，发行四百五十万册以上，学习普通话的留声片发行一百三十八万张。各省方言初步普查工作，除个别省份要延至明年外，一般都在今年年底完成。
    各省、市办的语音训练班的教师，在受过三五个星期集中训练以后，有80％以上的人可以担任县市训练班的讲师或辅导员。各县市受过训练的中、小学教师有70％以上的人能用北京语音发音、拼音和朗读课文。教师用普通话教学，深受学生欢迎。
    由于推广普通话宣传不够广泛，因而使推广普通话的政治意义还没有为社会各方面充分了解，引起各方面的重视和支持。因此，推广普通话工作开展得不平衡。但是，经过教育部和文字改革委员会共同召开有关会议以后，各省市领导上不重视的情况已经逐渐扭转。暑假期间，北京、广西、河南等省市举办了普通话语音训练班。河北省教育厅已初步拟出了各级各类学校推广普通话工作规划；陕西省正在组织教师们收听该省电台举办的普通话语音教学广播。
