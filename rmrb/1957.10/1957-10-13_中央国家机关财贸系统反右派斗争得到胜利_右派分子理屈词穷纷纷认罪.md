Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: The anti-Rightist struggle in over 180 divisions and bureaus of nine ministries within the Central State Organs' financial and trade system has achieved a major victory. Over 90% of the masses in these units have joined the battle, and the Rightists being struggled against are now surrendering.

In recent days, a new group of Rightists has been exposed in the financial and trade system, including: Li Yu and Guo Chao from the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Dai Zhen from the Ministry of Aquatic Products, Liu Chen from the Ministry of Urban Services, Li Shanfeng from the Ministry of Commerce, Gan Peigen, Gui Qizhang, Chen Ming, and Xu Jingbo from the People's Bank, and Shi Lingyun from the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.

These Rightists viciously attacked the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. They said that the socialist planned economy was not as "free" and "flexible" as the capitalist economy, and that Communist Party members and veteran cadres could not lead foreign trade. They opposed agricultural collectivization and the state monopoly of purchase and marketing, believing that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was a complete mess." They harbored deep hatred for the Communist Party and the people, as Rightist Li Yu said, "Ge Peiqi was right to say that Communist Party members should be killed, I would kill several of them."

In the encirclement and suppression by the masses, who presented the facts, reasoned things out, peeled back layers, and delved deeper step by step, these Rightists were mostly at a loss for words and had no choice but to surrender. As Rightist Zhai Jingzong from the China National Transportation Electrical Equipment Company said, "In the past, I always looked for loopholes in everyone's speeches to refute them, but later on, there were no loopholes to exploit in everyone's speeches, and they were all presenting concrete facts. In the face of these facts, I had to consider my own mistakes. The exposure and criticism from everyone did not wrong me at all."

Currently, a very small number of Rightists in these units are still resisting stubbornly, but they have become completely isolated among the masses.

### 中央国家机关财贸系统反右派斗争得到胜利  右派分子理屈词穷纷纷认罪

    中央国家机关财贸系统反右派斗争得到胜利
    右派分子理屈词穷纷纷认罪
    据新华社11日讯　中央国家机关财政贸易系统九个部一百八十多个司、局单位的反右派斗争已经获得重大胜利。这些单位有90％以上的群众投入了战斗，现在被斗争的右派分子已经纷纷缴械投降。
    在最近一些日子里，财贸系统新揭露出来的一批右派分子中有：对外贸易部的李玉、郭超，水产部的戴镇，城市服务部的刘琛，商业部的李善丰，人民银行的甘培根、归淇章、陈明、徐静波，合作总社的史凌云。
    这些右派分子凶恶地攻击共产党的领导和社会主义制度。他们说，社会主义计划经济不如资本主义经济来得“自由”、“灵活”，说共产党员和老干部不能领导对外贸易。他们反对农业合作化，反对统购统销，认为“肃反搞得一团糟”。他们对共产党和人民有刻骨的仇恨，如右派分子李玉说：“葛佩琦说杀共产党人是有道理的，我都要杀他几个。”
    这些右派分子在群众摆事实，讲道理，层层剥皮，步步深入的围剿中，大都理屈词穷，不得不缴械投降。如中国交通电工器材公司右派分子翟敬宗说：“在过去，我都是寻找大家发言的漏洞来反驳，可是到后来，大家的发言没有空子可钻，摆的都是具体事实，在这些事实面前我不得不考虑自己的错误。大家对我的揭露和批判，一点也没有屈我。”
    现在，这些单位有极少数右派分子还在顽抗，但是他们在群众中已经完全陷于孤立。
