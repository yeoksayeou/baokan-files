Helping to Rectify While Correcting: Further Great Blooming and Contending; Big-Character Posters of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry Play a Great Role

(Our report) Since the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry entered the third stage of the rectification campaign on the 23rd, it quickly began a mass upsurge of great blooming and contending, mainly in the form of big-character posters. As of the 29th, twenty-eight units under the various departments and bureaus of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry had posted a total of more than 2,200 big-character posters. The big-character posters have made sharp criticisms of the bureaucratic, subjectivist, and sectarian phenomena that existed in the past among the leaders at all levels of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. Some big-character posters also put forward suggestions for improvement aimed at shortcomings in the work.

Criticism of Overlapping Institutions and Overstaffing

More criticism in the big-character posters concerns the problem of overlapping institutions and overstaffing. In addition to expressing warm support for Vice Minister Lü’s opinion on merging departments and bureaus in the mobilization report, many big-character posters also put forward some specific criticisms and suggestions. Someone questioned why the Labor and Wages Department had to set up an office within the department, and whether it was necessary. Someone suggested merging the Citizens' Complaint Handling Office of the Supervisory Bureau, which has the same nature and task, with the People's Reception Office of the General Office. Others advocated that the divisions and sections within the departments should also be merged into one, to reduce levels and facilitate overcoming bureaucracy. Overlapping institutions inevitably lead to overstaffing, and the big-character posters exposed the phenomenon of overstaffing. Some staff members of the Supervisory Bureau, after analyzing the work tasks of their unit in a big-character poster, suggested reducing personnel by 60%. Some people believe that there are too many secretaries for the minister with too little to do, especially when the minister is on a business trip, and if they are used in a unified and concentrated manner, the number of personnel can be reduced by half.

The criticism of institutional problems in the big-character posters is not limited to the ministry itself, but also involves the situation of affiliated enterprises. A big-character poster entitled "Why are the Institutions in Enterprises Getting Bigger and Bigger?" pointed out that the main reason for the large institutions and large numbers of personnel in enterprises is inseparable from the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. Some directors of departments and bureaus emphasized specialization, and in order to strengthen the work of specialized departments, they instructed enterprises to add institutions. In 1956, more than 10,000 personnel were added to enterprises in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry system due to instructions from higher authorities to add institutions. Some people also criticized the establishment of offices and working groups in Beijing by various industrial and mining enterprises, believing that these institutions have little effect, waste too much manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and should be cancelled altogether; if some enterprises must have people working in Beijing, they can stay at the guest house of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry.

Criticism and Suggestions on System Issues

In terms of system issues, the big-character posters also put forward many criticisms and suggestions. The financial work of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is now divided according to the divisions, and is managed by nine departments separately. Many loopholes have arisen in the work, and some people have suggested that they should be appropriately merged. Others have suggested establishing a special institution to review design and budget documents, and that the work should be directly led by the vice minister or assistant minister, in order to overcome the shortcomings of too many levels of review in the past (review opinions must be signed and issued by leaders at the section, division, bureau, and ministry levels), long delays, and short review times and poor quality of professional units.

The big-character posters also touched on some issues in the implementation of policies and guidelines. For example, some people criticized the basic construction departments for not conscientiously implementing the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift, and that the budgeted norms for the unit area of factory buildings exceeded actual needs, resulting in a too high percentage of indirect production costs and causing great waste to the state.

Criticism of the Ideological Style of Leading Cadres

The big-character posters also criticized the problems in the ideological style of some leading cadres. The title of one big-character poster was: "Please, Director Zhai, Come Downstairs!" Criticizing Zhai, the Deputy Director of the General Office, for lacking concrete leadership in the work of the Foreign Liaison Department that he concurrently manages. In addition, some people criticized the work style of the Director of the Design Bureau for not being in-depth, and for not adhering to the practice of summarizing and arranging work on a quarterly basis. Another big-character poster exposed the bureaucracy of the supply and marketing departments. The facts revealed in this big-character poster are: The basic construction office of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company needed steel plates, and the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company itself also produced steel plates; however, the supply and marketing department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry allocated the basic construction office of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company to order goods from Anshan Iron and Steel, and allocated the products of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company to the Northeast region. Another fact is: The steel produced by the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company was transported to the Northwest, and should have been transported by the Chengdu-Chongqing and Baoji-Chengdu railways, but the supply and marketing department signed a contract with the Ministry of Railways to detour through Wuhan.

The big-character posters also put forward many criticisms and suggestions on the problems existing in employee welfare work, employee education work, and trade union work. Some even went beyond the scope of the ministry itself and put forward their own opinions on certain national systems or regulations, such as the public medical care system and the principles for reimbursing travel expenses for business trips.

Debates Have Already Begun on Certain Issues

In the big-character posters, there are not only sharp criticisms and many suggestions, but also debates have begun on certain issues. For example, some people have proposed that the Supply Bureau and the Sales Bureau should be merged in order to balance the distribution of products and materials, avoid buck-passing, and save cadres and expenses. Some people disagree with this view, arguing that supplying materials and selling products are tasks of different natures and should not be merged, and that merging will not achieve the above-mentioned goals; but they agree to streamline institutions and personnel in these two units. Others have pointed out that employee welfare should not be entirely covered by the public, and that some current welfare systems (such as medical insurance) should be reformed; others believe that these welfare systems should be retained.

Some of the individuals or units criticized in the big-character posters have also posted big-character posters, thanking the people who made suggestions, and expressing their determination to resolutely correct their mistakes, or explaining the situation that has been corrected.

### 帮助边整边改　再次大鸣大放  冶金部大字报发挥着大作用

    帮助边整边改　再次大鸣大放
    冶金部大字报发挥着大作用
    本报讯　冶金工业部自23日转入整风第三阶段以后，很快就开始了以大字报为主要形式的群众性的大鸣大放热潮。截至29日为止，冶金部所属各司局，已经有二十八个单位共贴出大字报二千二百多张。大字报对过去冶金部各级领导上存在的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义现象提出了尖锐的批评，有些大字报还针对工作中的缺点提出了改进的建议。
    对机构重叠人浮于事的批评
    大字报批评较多的是有关机构重叠、人浮于事的问题。许多大字报除表示热烈拥护吕副部长在动员报告中提出的司、局合并的意见之外，还提出了一些具体的批评和建议。有人质问劳动工资司为甚么要在司内设立办公室，是不是有此必要？有人建议把性质和任务相同的监察局的公民控诉处与办公厅的人民接待室合并。还有人主张司内的处与科也合并为一，以减少层次，便于克服官僚主义。机构重叠，必然会有冗员，大字报对人浮于事的现象作了揭发。监察局有的工作人员在大字报上分析了本单位的工作任务之后，提出了减少人员60％的建议。有人认为部长秘书人多事少，特别是在部长出差时更是无事可作，如果统一集中使用，人员可以减少一半。
    大字报对机构问题的批评，不仅限于本部，同时也涉及到所属企业的情况。一张大字报以“企业里的机构为甚么愈来愈大？”为题，指出企业里机构大、人员多的主要原因，与冶金部的官僚主义、主观主义是分不开的。有些司局长强调专业化，为加强专业部门的工作，就指示企业增设机构。1956年冶金部系统企业由于上级指示增设机构而增加的人员就有一万多名。有人对各地工矿企业在北京设立办事处、工作组等机构也提出了批评，认为这些机构作用不大，人力物力财力浪费太多，应该一律取消；如果有的企业必须有人在北京工作，可以住冶金部的招待所。
    对体制问题的批评和建议
    在体制问题方面，大字报也提出了许多批评和建议。冶金部的财务工作，现在按各司分工，分别由九个部门管理，工作中产生不少漏洞，有人就提出了加以适当合并的建议。另外还有人建议成立专门审核设计及预算文件的机构，由副部长或部长助理直接领导工作，以克服过去的审核层次过多（审核意见要经过科、处、局、部各级领导签发），时间拖长，而专业单位审核时间又过短，质量不高的缺点。
    大字报也涉及到执行方针政策的一些问题。如有人批评基本建设部门没有认真贯彻勤俭建国方针，制定的厂房单位面积预算定额超过实际需要，使间接生产费用的百分比太高，给国家造成很大浪费。
    对领导干部思想作风的批评
    对一些领导干部的思想作风上的毛病，大字报也作了批评。一张大字报的标题是：“请翟司长下楼来！”批评办公厅翟副主任对兼管的对外联络司的工作缺乏具体领导。另外有人对设计局局长的工作作风不深入，以及不坚持按季度总结和布置工作的缺点提出了批评。还有一张大字报对供销部门的官僚主义作了揭发。这张大字报所揭露的事实是：重庆钢铁公司基本建设处需要钢板，重庆钢铁公司本身也生产钢板；但是，冶金部供销部门却分配重庆钢铁公司基本建设处去到鞍钢订货，而又把重庆钢铁公司的产品分配到东北地区。另一件事实是：重庆钢铁公司生产的钢材运往西北，本来应该由成渝、宝成铁路运输，但供销部门与铁道部订了合同，要绕道经过武汉运输。
    对职工福利工作、职工教育工作、工会工作等方面存在的问题，大字报也提出了不少的批评和建议。有的更超出了本部的范围，就国家的某项制度或规定，如公费医疗制度、出差旅费报销原则等，提出了自己的意见。
    在某些问题上已经开始争论
    在大字报中，不仅有尖锐的批评和很多的建议，而且在某些问题上也开始了争论。如有人提出供应局与销售局应该合并，以便使产品、材料平衡分配，避免扯皮，又可以节省干部和经费。有人不同意这个意见，理由是供应材料和销售产品是不同性质的任务，不宜合并，合并后也不能达到上述目的；但他同意在这两个单位紧缩机构和人员。也有人指出不应把职工福利全部由公家包下来，对目前一些福利制度（如医疗统筹等）应加以改革；有人则认为目前这些福利制度还应当保留。
    被大字报所批评的个人或单位，有的也贴出了大字报，向提意见的人致谢，并表示坚决地改的决心，或说明已经改正的情况。
