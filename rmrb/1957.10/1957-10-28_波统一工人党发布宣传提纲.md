Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Polish "People's Tribune" published a full-page of propaganda outlines issued by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party on the 24th to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    The outline emphasizes that the existence of the Soviet Union, its experience in building socialism, and its struggle for international peace have promoted the development of the revolutionary movement of the working class and the development and consolidation of communist and workers' parties around the world.

    The outline states that the October Revolution had a particularly huge impact on the fate of the Polish people. The alliance with the Soviet Union and the fact that Poland belongs to the socialist camp have made it possible to successfully carry out the basic tasks of the socialist revolution in Poland. This has made it possible to protect the country from interference by capitalist countries and to enable the revolutionary forces to suppress counter-revolutionary activities. It has also made it possible to develop our economy in the face of imperialist economic blockades. Poland's economic relations with socialist countries and its defensive alliance within the socialist camp are today the guarantee of the country's independence and development.

    The outline points out that the abnormal phenomena that occurred in the mutual relations between Poland and the Soviet Union in previous years have been successfully eliminated. The friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union and the unity of the socialist camp determine Poland's highest socialist and national interests. Because the interests of our country and our working class are inextricably linked with the strengthening and victory of socialist and peaceful forces worldwide.

    波统一工人党发布宣传提纲
    新华社讯　波兰“人民论坛报”24日以整版篇幅刊载了波兰统一工人党中央委员会宣传部发布的庆祝十月革命四十周年的宣传提纲。
    提纲着重指出，苏联的存在、它在建设社会主义中的经验和它为国际和平进行的斗争促进了工人阶级革命运动的发展，促进了全世界共产党和工人党的发展和巩固。
    提纲说，十月革命对波兰人民的命运的影响是特别巨大的。和苏联结成联盟以及波兰属于社会主义阵营这个事实使得有可能在波兰成功地执行社会主义革命的基本任务。这使得有可能保护这个国家不受资本主义国家的干涉，并且使革命力量能够镇压反革命活动。这也使得有可能在帝国主义经济封锁的情况下发展我们的经济。波兰同社会主义国家的经济关系和它在社会主义阵营内的防御联盟在今天就是这个国家的独立和发展的保证。
    提纲指出，前些年在波兰和苏联的相互关系中所出现的不正常现象已经成功地消除了。波兰和苏联的友谊以及社会主义阵营的团结决定波兰最高的社会主义利益和民族利益。因为我们国家和我们工人阶级的利益是和全世界社会主义和和平力量的加强和胜利不可分割地联系着的。
