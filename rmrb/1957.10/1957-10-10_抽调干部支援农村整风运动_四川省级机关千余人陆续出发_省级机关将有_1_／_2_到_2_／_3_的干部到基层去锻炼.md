Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 9th. Recently, Sichuan Province transferred over a thousand cadres from provincial-level organs, Party schools, Communist Youth League schools, and other units to form fourteen work teams, which will go to various special districts to participate in rural socialist education work. Currently, the work teams are departing in succession to their designated work areas.

The leaders of each work team are cadres at the level of directors of departments and commissions of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee and directors of bureaus of the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee. Among the members of the work teams, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members account for 80%, and the rest are activists in various work tasks and the anti-Rightist struggle.

On October 5th, Li Dazhang, Secretary of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee and Governor of Sichuan Province, gave a report to the cadres going to the countryside, providing a detailed introduction to the current situation of the rural rectification and socialist education pilot programs, and explaining the key points, policy principles, and precautions to be grasped in the midst of great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters. Li Dazhang also instructed the cadres of each work team that after they go down, they should obey the leadership of the local Party organizations, and they must learn from the peasant masses and comrades who have worked in the countryside for a long time. They must integrate themselves with the peasants in their daily lives and conscientiously train and improve themselves through work and study. In particular, they should learn the strong fighting will and hard-working style of the members of the poor and lower-middle peasant class in order to achieve the goal of reforming their thinking and improving their understanding.

According to a person in charge of the relevant departments of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee, during the socialist education movement, one-half to two-thirds of the cadres of Sichuan provincial-level organs will go to the grassroots for training.

    新华社成都9日电　四川省最近从省级机关、党校、团校等单位抽调了一千多名干部，组成十四个工作团，分赴各专区参加农村社会主义教育工作。现在各个工作团正在陆续出发到预定的工作地区。
    这次组成的工作团，各团团长都由中共省委各部、委负责人、省人民委员会的厅局长一级干部担任。工作团的成员中，共产党员和共青团员占80％，其余是各项工作和反右派斗争中的积极分子。
    10月5日，中共四川省委书记、四川省省长李大章向下乡的干部作了报告，详细介绍了目前农村整风和社会主义教育试点的情况，交代了在大鸣大放大争中应掌握的重点、政策原则、注意事项等。李大章还指示各工作团的干部下去以后，应当服从当地党组织的领导，必须向农民群众和长期在农村工作的同志学习，在生活上同农民打成一片，认真从工作和学习中锻炼自己，提高自己。特别应该学习贫雇农成分的社员的坚强斗争意志和艰苦朴素的作风，以便达到改造思想、提高认识的目的。
    据中共四川省委有关部门负责人谈：在社会主义教育运动期间，四川省级机关将有二分之一到三分之二的干部到基层去锻炼。
