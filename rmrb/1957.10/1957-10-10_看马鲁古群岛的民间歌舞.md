    Watching Folk Songs and Dances of the Maluku Islands

    A friend who grew up in Indonesia often introduced me to this beautiful country with longing. He described Indonesia, a country of thousands of islands with more than two thousand years of national cultural tradition, as a string of pearl necklaces surrounding the equator, saying that it is not only a perennial garden in terms of scenery, but also has a special radiance in art. I don't know much about Indonesia, but after seeing the Indonesian Art Troupe's visit to China in 1954, the enchanting performances of the Bali Art Friendship Delegation from the "Poetry Island" in 1956, and now the moving performances of the Maluku Art Friendship Delegation from eastern Indonesia, I have also become an enthusiastic promoter of the songs and dances of this beautiful country.
    Indonesia's songs and dances are like brilliant flowers, blooming in a beautiful garden. We know that the Javanese people produced classical arts such as "Wayang" and "Gamelan" two thousand years ago. Subsequently, records of dances also appeared in Java, Madura, Bali, and Sumatra. When ancient Indian civilization entered Indonesia with Indian Buddhism in the second century AD, the country's culture and art entered a new period of prosperity.
    From the music and dance of Bali and the Javanese and Balinese classical dances brought by the Indonesian Art Troupe in 1954, to the folk dances popular in the Sumatra region, and the "Panggalena Dance" of Sulawesi Island, all fully demonstrate the distinct national characteristics of folk art in western and central Indonesia.
    The Maluku art troupe brought this time is the folk songs and dances of the eastern region of Indonesia. The Maluku Islands are adjacent to West Irian. This time, in the Maluku art friendship delegation, we not only saw the Maluku folk songs and dances of the eastern region of Indonesia, but also followed the brothers from West Irian and their dances full of the spirit of resistance. Under the 350 years of rule by Dutch colonialism, the living standards of the people of West Irian have not changed. There are still people living a primitive Stone Age life in the interior of West Irian. After seeing the "West Irian Song of Heroes Dance" this time, it aroused even stronger hatred for the colonialists in my heart.
    The folk songs and dances of the Maluku Islands show another style and color. Among them are the "Longgen Sawat Dance" loved by the Islamic residents of the North Maluku Islands, the "Happy Dance" and "Chakayba Dance" reflecting folk weddings and festivals, and the "Bird of Paradise Dance" and "Pearl Dance" reflecting the beauty of the natural life of the Maluku Islands. These dances reflect the people's peaceful life and the optimistic spirit after the independence of the motherland in terms of content, and maintain the simple tradition of folk dance in terms of art, with soft lines and skillful movements of the wrists. This is a kind of softness that contains deep affection, fully reflecting the beautiful virtues of the Maluku people.
    The singing and playing of several musicians in the art troupe also embody the same characteristics as the dance. Several folk songs in the male chorus have a highly lyrical temperament. The harmonious and gentle singing is completely consistent with the delicate, soft and mellow movements and the fascinating mood of the dance, like the gentle moonlight shining through the dense shade of palm trees on the water, which is intoxicating. The artists' flute playing is also a very interesting program. This is a small multi-voice band with six flutes. The structure of the flute is similar to that of the Chinese flute, but the tube of the bass flute is as thick as the mouth of a cup, which may be the thickest flute we have ever seen. Its tone is mellow and broad, and it sounds very good. The Maluku people like to play the flute. They can play lyrical songs together, and they can also play music in the style of marches. This folk instrument maintains a simple style for the folk music of Maluku.
    The more I come into contact with the folk songs and dances of Indonesia, the more I am amazed at the artistic treasures of this country. Many islands that are not very far apart, their residents retain different costumes, customs, and even different styles of art, which is a symbol of the rich national spiritual life of Indonesia. Thank you very much to the Indonesian Maluku Art Friendship Delegation for bringing us so many well-preserved folk songs and dances from eastern Indonesia. Through these simple and authentic arts, we feel as if we are in that beautiful country, breathing together with the people there.

    看马鲁古群岛的民间歌舞
    叶林
    一位自幼在印度尼西亚长大的朋友常常带着怀念的心情向我介绍这个美丽的国家。他把印度尼西亚这个有了二千多年民族文化传统的千岛之国描写成为一串围绕着赤道的珍珠项链，说它不仅在景色上是一个四季常青的大花园，而且在艺术上也有着特殊的光芒。我对印度尼西亚知道的不多，但是，当我在1954年看到了印度尼西亚艺术团来我国访问演出、1956年又看到了来自有“诗岛”之称的峇厘艺术友好访问团的迷人的演出、现在又看到了来自印度尼西亚东部的马鲁古艺术友好访问团的动人的演出以后，我也变成了这个美丽国家的歌舞艺术的热烈的宣传者了。
    印度尼西亚的歌舞艺术像灿烂的繁花，盛开在美丽的大花园。我们知道在两千年前爪哇族就产生了“哇影”和“佳美銮”等古典艺术，随后，在爪哇、马都拉、峇厘和苏门答腊等地区也出现了舞蹈的记载。当印度古老的文明随着印度佛教在公元二世纪进入印度尼西亚的时候，这个国家的文化艺术更进入到了一个新的繁盛时期。
    从峇厘的音乐舞蹈和1954年印度尼西亚艺术团带来的爪哇和巴里的古典舞，流行于苏门答腊地区的民间舞，苏拉威西岛的“巴格蕾娜舞”等等，都充分地显示了印度尼西亚西部与中部地区民间艺术的鲜明的民族色彩。
    这次马鲁古艺术团带来的则是印度尼西亚东部地区的民间歌舞，马鲁古群岛与西伊里安相邻，这次在马鲁古艺术友好访问团中，不仅让我们看到了印度尼西亚东部地区的马鲁古民间歌舞，而且还随着前来了西伊里安的兄弟们和他们的富于反抗精神的舞蹈。在荷兰殖民主义三百五十年的统治之下，西伊里安人民的生活水平没有什么变化。西伊里安内地还有过着石器时代原始生活的人。这次看到了“西伊里安歌颂英雄舞”以后，心中更加掀起了对殖民主义者的强烈的憎恨。
    马鲁古群岛的民间歌舞则显示了另外一种风格和色彩，这里面有为北马鲁古群岛伊斯兰教居民所喜爱的“隆庚·沙哇特舞”，有反映民间婚庆和节日的“欢乐舞”和“查开巴舞”，也有反映马鲁古群岛大自然生活的美妙的“极乐鸟舞”和“珍珠舞”。这些舞蹈在内容上反映了人民的和平生活和祖国独立后的乐观精神，在艺术上则保持着民间舞蹈朴素的传统，有着柔和的线条和手腕巧妙的动作。这是一种蕴藏着深情的旋律似的柔和，充分体现了马鲁古人民的美好的品德。
    艺术团的几位音乐家的演唱和演奏也体现着和舞蹈相同的特点。男声小合唱的几首民歌有着高度抒情的气质，谐和调协而又温柔的歌声和舞蹈的那种细致、柔软圆润的动作和使人迷恋的情调是完全一致的，有如融融的月色透过棕榈的浓荫影射到水波上的那种轻柔，令人陶醉。艺术家们的笛子演奏也是一个很有趣的节目。这是一个具有六根笛子的多声部的小型乐队。笛子的构造和中国笛相类似，但低音笛的笛管却有杯口那么粗，这也许是我们所见到过的最粗的一种笛子，它的音色圆润而宽广，十分好听。马鲁古人民喜爱吹笛子，他们能合奏抒情的歌曲，也能演奏进行曲风的乐曲。这种民间乐器给马鲁古的民间音乐保持着一种朴素的风格。
    接触印度尼西亚的民间歌舞艺术越多，则越为这个国家的艺术宝库感到惊奇。许多距离并不很远的岛屿，它们的居民却各自保存着不同的服饰、风俗习惯以至不同风格的艺术，这是印度尼西亚民族精神生活丰富的象征。非常感谢印度尼西亚马鲁古艺术友好访问团给我们带来了这许多保存得很好的印度尼西亚东部民间歌舞，通过这些朴素真实的艺术，使我们有如置身于那个美丽的国家之中，和那里的人民共同在一起呼吸。
