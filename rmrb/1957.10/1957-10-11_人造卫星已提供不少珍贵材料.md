Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: TASS reports: As of 6:00 AM Moscow time on October 10th, the artificial satellite had completed 78 orbits around the Earth, covering a distance of approximately 3.5 million kilometers. Many radio enthusiasts have provided extremely valuable information. Extensive information sent from scientific stations, radar stations, and radio enthusiasts is being carefully studied to determine the satellite and carrier rocket's operating parameters. The results of studying the material from completed orbit measurements indicate that the time required for the satellite to orbit the Earth has decreased by about three seconds per day. The fact that the rotation time changes very little within a day indicates that the satellite will continue to orbit the Earth for a long time. So far, only minor changes have occurred in the distance between the satellite and the carrier rocket.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 9th: TASS reports: The density of the upper atmosphere is much thinner than previously expected, according to preliminary analysis of the first artificial Earth satellite's flight orbit by Soviet scientists.

Professor V. Krasovsky, a physics expert studying the upper atmosphere, said: The stable and unchanged period of the satellite's operation and its orbit proves that the density of the atmosphere is very low at an altitude of 300 to 500 kilometers above sea level. The satellite's stability is due to the extremely small resistance it encounters, which is so small that it has not yet been discovered or measured.

The density and pressure of the upper atmosphere are closely related to the temperature at this altitude. Therefore, the current operational situation of the artificial satellite can determine the latest situation of the atmosphere's temperature, and it is entirely reasonable to say that the temperature at the above-mentioned altitude is much lower than previously imagined. Under such conditions, the satellite can continue to operate for an indeterminate long period. However, it will only take a few more months to study and observe the data obtained from the Earth satellite, and then it will be possible to draw final conclusions.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: TASS reports: Soviet Doctor of Technical Sciences, Pokrovsky, said in an article published in the Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" on the 8th that after launching a series of artificial satellites, the next step will probably be to launch a space rocket orbiting the moon. However, there will still be a period of time before unmanned and manned spaceflights to the moon or other planets can begin.

In the article, Pokrovsky also discussed the relationship between artificial satellites and intercontinental rockets. The article stated that the Earth satellite and intercontinental rocket created by Soviet scientists are very similar. The intercontinental rocket can land in any area of the Earth, which provides a theoretical basis for concluding that the rocket's speed can reach six or seven kilometers per second. The speed of the artificial satellite is slightly less than eight kilometers per second. The speeds of the two are similar. Achieving this speed requires lightweight and small-sized engines that can generate enormous power. Currently, even atomic energy engines cannot approach this level of power.

The movement of the rocket launching the artificial satellite is extremely accurate. Its accuracy is due to a very complex and sensitive automatic control system.

After the artificial satellite is launched, very accurate data on the distribution of extremely thin gas in the highest part of the atmosphere can be obtained through various instruments. Artificial satellites can also help understand the potential dangers of large and small meteoroids to spacecraft. Now, the first Soviet artificial satellite has been operating in the sky for a relatively long time and continues to transmit radio signals. Based on this, it can be judged that the danger of meteoroid impact has not occurred at present.

Pokrovsky also pointed out that this artificial satellite will be able to obtain information about primary cosmic rays. This type of radiation is very necessary for studying the conditions for human flight in space. In addition, ground observations of the artificial satellite's operating altitude can also accurately obtain materials such as the shape of the Earth and the abnormal situation of the gravitational effects in various regions of the Earth.

　　人造卫星已提供不少珍贵材料
    绕地球一周的时间变化很少，证明卫星将运行很长时间；五百公里高空大气密度很小，温度很低；大小流星撞击的危险目前还没有发生过；再过一段岁月，就可以作到月球的宇宙飞行。
    据新华社10日讯  据塔斯社讯：到10月10日莫斯科时间六时为止，人造卫星绕地球运行七十八周，经过路程约为三百五十万公里。很多无线电爱好者提供了极为珍贵的情报。从科学站、雷达站以及无线电爱好者那里送来的广泛的情报正在仔细地加以研究，以便确定卫星和运载火箭的运行参数。对已完成的轨道测定的材料的研究结果表明，卫星绕地球一周所需的时间在一昼夜内约减慢三秒钟。从旋转的时间在一昼夜内变化很少可以断定，卫星将继续绕地球运行很长的时间。到目前为止，卫星和运载火箭之间的距离只发生了微小的变化。
    新华社10日讯　塔斯社莫斯科9日讯：大气上层的密度比过去预料的要稀薄得多，这是苏联科学家对第一颗人造地球卫星飞行轨道初步分析而得出的结论。
    研究大气上层情况的物理学专家瓦·克拉索夫斯基教授说：卫星运行的周期和它运行的轨道稳定不变，这就证明了在三百公里到五百公里以上的高空，大气的密度非常小。卫星的稳定是由于它所受到的阻力极为微小，甚至到目前为止，还无法发现和测定这个阻力。
    大气上层的密度和压力同这个高度里的温度有着密切的关系。所以，这次人造卫星的运行情况就可以确定大气层温度的最新情况，并且完全有根据可以肯定说，在上述高度里的温度比过去预想的低得多。在这样的条件下，卫星可以在一个不能确知的长时期内继续运行。但是，只需要再过数月，研究观察地球卫星所得的资料以后，就有可能作出最后的结论。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联技术科学博士波克罗夫斯基，8日在苏联“消息报”上发表的一篇文章说，在发射一系列人造卫星以后，下一步大概将发射围绕月球运行的宇宙火箭。但是，到开始向月球或其他行星作不载人和载人的宇宙飞行时，还有一段岁月。
    波克罗夫斯基在这篇文章中还谈到人造卫星和洲际火箭的关系。文章说，苏联科学家创造的地球卫星和洲际火箭是很接近的。洲际火箭能够落到地球上任何一个地区，这就有理论根据来得出一个结论：火箭每秒的速度能够达到六、七公里。而人造卫星每秒的速度为八公里稍弱。两者的速度是相近的。获得这种速度，需要能够发出巨大功率的重量轻、体积小的发动机。现在，即使原子能发动机也不能接近于这种功率水平。
    发射人造卫星的火箭的运动是极其准确的。其所以准确是因为有一个很复杂而又灵敏的自动操纵系统。
    人造卫星发射以后，通过各种仪器，可以得到有关大气层最高处极稀薄的气体分布情况的非常准确的材料。人造卫星还能够帮助了解大小流星对宇宙飞船可能发生的危险性。现在，苏联第一颗人造卫星已比较长久地在天空运行，并且继续发出无线电讯号，根据这点来判断，流星撞击的危险在目前还没有发生过。
    波克罗夫斯基还指出，这颗人造卫星将能获得有关原始宇宙线的情况。这种射线对研究人在宇宙间飞行的条件是非常必要的。此外，地面上对人造卫星运行高度的观察，还可精确获得地球的形状、地球各区引力作用的反常情况等材料。
