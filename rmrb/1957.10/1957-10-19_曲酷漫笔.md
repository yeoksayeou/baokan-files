　　Rambling Notes from Quku
　　Chou Baoyan
　　Up along the Halagai River, nestled among overlapping mountain ranges, lie the summer pastures of the herdsmen of Gangcha County in the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province. Here, mushrooms carpet the ground like clusters of flowers, and the vast, undulating grasslands stretch out like a sea of green. At the foot of the mountains, the source of the rivers, a misty fog rises day and night, obscuring the sky. At dawn and dusk, when everything on earth is drowsy and hazy, the fog is even thicker, creating a spectacular misty scene in the mountains. The Tibetans call this place "Quku," which translates to "hot water" in Chinese. It is the location of hot springs.

　　In this enchanting environment, who wouldn't want to indulge in a hot spring bath? However, such plans often lead to disappointment. Usually, just as dawn breaks and the mountain peaks are bathed in the first rays of sunlight, the outdoor pools are already occupied by bathing herdsmen. Around the hot springs, there are piles of Buddha statues and stone slabs carved with scriptures. Some of the statues and slabs are of unknown age, their inscriptions blurred. The herdsmen bathing in the spring pools chant scriptures aloud. Over the centuries, the herdsmen have learned from experience about the therapeutic properties of mineral springs. However, in the face of the mysterious power of nature, they still cannot help but be filled with devout and obsessed emotions. In the mist, facing the stone piles and Buddha statues, listening to the scriptures echoing in the valley, how can one not be drawn into reverie?

　　But that is not what we want to talk about.

　　Along the stream of the hot spring, around a small mountain corner, there is a long and narrow pool built with cement. Hot spring water is drawn from the ground, creating a sheep medicinal bath pool with a unique advantage. In the golden light of the morning sun, flocks of sheep are driven here, and the herdsmen pour "666" powder into the pool for the sheep to bathe in. Some sheep seem accustomed to it, swimming comfortably in the water, while others seem to be doing it for the first time, frightened and running around wildly. Young men with sturdy, half-naked bodies stand beside the pool, using yak hair ropes to hold onto the horns of those who are not tame, pulling them through the medicinal water one by one. An elderly herdsman standing on the side, waving his large sheepskin sleeves, says to the young men with a smile: "I always thought 'Quku' was only for bathing people, who knew it could also be used to wash sheep. The people's government's methods are truly great!"

　　A few steps further along, there is a small, snow-white tent supported by poles, which is the mobile clinic of the county health center. Although the tent is not large, there are quite a few people seeking medical care, some having just arrived on horseback after traveling for one or two days, others coming after bathing in the hot springs. In short, they can no longer rely solely on bathing in mineral water and chanting scriptures to cure their illnesses, and they gather at this small clinic to seek the happiness of being healthy. The herdsmen sit around the tent, one by one patiently describing their ailments to the "Manba" - the doctor. There is only one "Manba," and he is truly busy, picking up a stethoscope one moment, a syringe the next, and then wrapping medicine. Don't underestimate this tent clinic; from aspirin to penicillin, all kinds of medicine are available. Who can have any reason to complain about receiving medical care here?

　　Diagonally opposite the medical clinic, there is a tall, conical tent supported by a single long pole. Although the tent is tall, the wool piled beside it is even taller, making it clear that this is a supply and marketing cooperative. Sure enough, that's right, come in and take a look! The goods here can be described as dazzling - stacks of tea bricks, half a person high and neatly arranged, serve as the sales counter; coral beads and knives with silver sheaths hang from the tent's long pole; silk threads and golden brocade are draped over the ropes; various fabrics, woolens, and silks are piled on the ground; batteries, porcelain bowls, and felt hats are displayed on the shelves; and boxes contain biscuits and candy... It's no wonder that Jiu Ke from the Guoluo Tibetan tribe, after selling his wool, quietly asked his wife: "Is it the glare of the sun hurting my eyes? Why can't I seem to see anything clearly in this tent?" His wife smiled and whispered back in a kind tone: "No, it's not. It's because there are too many goods, your eyes are confused." Their whispers were overheard by others, and people laughed loudly, shouting: "Jia Nuo He! Jia Nuo He!" (Fucha tea! Fucha tea!) "Xiao Hu Duo! Xiao Hu Duo!" (Cigarettes! Cigarettes!) "Rui! Rui!" (Cloth! Cloth!)... The sales staff are constantly selecting the goods that customers like. Although there are many Han comrades among the sales staff, they speak fluent Tibetan when doing business. Look! Some herdsmen are carrying cloth and tea; others are also carrying a cloisonné wine pot; and some children are holding toy frogs that can jump automatically... Everyone's faces are full of smiles. Even after riding away a good distance, they are still playfully shouting to each other: "A Luo! Slow down! Be careful that the heavy goods crush your old horse!"

　　Although it is summer daylight, the sun sets quickly beside the hot springs. In the evening, everything on earth returns to temporary tranquility, with only a small flag fluttering in the wind on the distant mountaintop – is it a white prayer flag planted by the Tibetans? No, it is not. Climbing up close, you can see clearly that it is the red and white flag of the exploration team. It proudly tells people: The footprints of the exploration team members have already been imprinted on the ridges of the Qilian Mountains.

　　曲酷漫笔
　　仇保燕
    沿着哈尔盖河的上游，在重重叠叠的山岭中，是青海省海北藏族自治州刚察县牧民的夏季牧场。这里，遍地的蘑菇像是簇簇的花朵，起伏无际的草原好像是伸展着的一片绿色的海洋。就在这江河之源的山角下，日日夜夜腾起着一片漫天迷蒙的雾；在黎明，在黄昏，当大地的一切在昏暗里睡意朦胧的时候，这里的雾色就更浓，山峦间有着云雾蒙蒙的奇景。这个地方藏民管它叫作“曲酷”，汉语的译意是“热水”。这里是温泉的所在地。
    在这迷人的环境里，有谁不想痛痛快快地来一次温泉浴？可是，这种打算常常会使人失望。经常是在天将破晓，山顶上刚刚披上霞光的时候，露天浴池就被洗澡的牧民们占据。温泉旁到处堆砌着佛像和刻着经文的石片，有些佛像和石片不知道年代有多么久远，刻迹已经模糊了。泉池里洗浴的牧民在高声地诵经。千百年来，牧民们从生活的经验里懂得了矿泉疗病的功能，但在大自然神秘威力的面前，他们也还不能不仍然洋溢着虔诚痴迷的感情。在云雾里，面对着石堆、佛像，倾听着回旋在山谷的经声，怎能不把人引入遐想之中？
    但是，我们要述说的不是这些。
    沿着温泉的流水，转过一个小小的山角，这里有座用水泥建筑的狭长水池。温泉的热水从地下引来，这是一座得天独厚的羊药浴池。在朝阳的金光里，一群群的羊被赶来，牧民们把“六六六”粉倒在池里给羊群洗浴。有些羊看来像是已经习惯了，在水里怡然自得地游泳；有些还像是头一次，吓得飞跑乱跳。池旁的年青人半裸着结实的身体，用牛毛绳吊住那些不驯服者的牴角，一个个地从药水中拉过。在一边站着的一位老年牧民，一面摇动着他那宽大的皮袄袖子，一面笑咪咪地向小伙子们说：“我从来以为‘曲酷’只是洗人的，谁知道也洗起羊来了。人民政府的办法大大的有呀！”
    从这里再走几步路，支着一顶雪白的小帐房，这是县卫生院的流动诊所。帐房虽然不大，看病的人却有不少，有的是骑马从一、两天的路程上刚刚赶到的；有的是从温泉里洗浴后而来的。总之，他们已经再不能单单依靠洗矿泉水和诵经来治病了，聚集到这小小的诊疗所里来寻求无病的幸福。牧民们环坐在帐房的四周，一个个依次详尽地向“满巴”叙述着自己的病情。“满巴”——医生只有一位，可真够忙的，他一会儿拿起听诊器，一会儿拿起注射的针头，一会儿又在包药。别看这座帐房诊所不大，从阿斯匹灵到盘尼西林应用的药却一概俱全。在这里看病，有谁又有什么理由说得出一句抱怨的话呢？
    医疗所的斜对面，有一座只用一根长杆子支起的尖顶高帐房。别看这座帐房高，在它身旁堆积的羊毛比它还要高，一看就知道这是供销合作社。果然不错，请进来参观参观吧！这里的货物可以称得起琳琅满目——半人高的、垒得整整齐齐的茶砖就是售货台；帐房的长杆子上挂着珊瑚串和带有银套的刀子；纵横的绳子上搭着丝线和金色的织锦；地上堆着各色的布匹、毛呢和绸缎；货架子上摆着电池、磁碗、呢帽；箱子里还有饼干、糖……。难怪果洛藏部落的久科刚刚把羊毛卖掉，进来就小声地问他的妻子道：“是不是烈日的光芒刺伤了我的眼睛？为什么在这帐房里好像是什么也看不清？”他的妻子微笑着小声而亲切地回答他：“不是的。是货物太多，你的眼睛已经迷乱了。”他们的小声话偏偏被别人听见了，人们大声地笑着，大声地喊着：“贾诺贺！贾诺贺！”（茯茶！茯茶！）“小胡多！小胡多！”（纸烟！纸烟！）“锐！锐！”（布！布！）……售货员不停地为顾客们挑选着称心如意的货物。这里的售货员中间虽然有不少的汉族同志，但他们作生意的藏话却对答如流。看吧！有的牧民抱着布和茶；有的还提着一个景泰蓝的小酒壶；有的娃娃手里拿着会自动跳跃的玩具小青蛙……每个人的脸上都藏不住欢笑。直到骑上马走了好远，还在互相戏谑地喊着：“阿啰！慢些走！当心那些沉重的货物压死你的老马呀！”
    虽然是夏季的白昼，可是温泉旁的太阳很快就落山了。傍晚，大地的一切恢复了暂时的平静，只有那不远的山顶上一面小旗在迎风飘扬——是不是藏民插下的白经旗？不是的。爬到跟前就可以看清楚，这是勘查队的红白旗。它骄傲地告诉人们：祁连山的丛岭中已经印上了勘查队员的足迹。
