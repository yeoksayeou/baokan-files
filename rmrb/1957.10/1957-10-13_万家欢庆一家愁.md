　　The World Celebrates Humanity's Great Achievement
    The first artificial satellite in human history was successfully launched by the Soviet Union on October 4th. This "little moon" orbits the Earth every ninety-six minutes, continuously traveling in the high altitude of nine hundred kilometers to three hundred kilometers between the Arctic Circle and the Antarctic Circle. With its meteor-like flashes and "beep, beep" radio signals, it tells people on Earth that a new era of mankind moving towards space has begun. This undeniable iron fact makes everyone feel the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the powerful strength of Soviet science and technology.
    Peace-loving people all over the world are cheering for this brilliant achievement of the Soviet Union. Needless to say, in various socialist countries, people regard it not only as the achievement of the Soviet Union, but also as the achievement of the entire socialist camp. People believe that this is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system, and also the best proof that the socialist camp uses its powerful scientific and technological strength for peaceful purposes. Even in capitalist countries, people regard the Soviet artificial satellite as an outstanding achievement of human wisdom and a huge victory for Soviet science. Many bourgeois newspapers also praised the success of the Soviet Union in launching the artificial satellite.
    Peace-loving politicians have seen the great political significance of the successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite in promoting world peace. The remarks of Indian Prime Minister Nehru are very representative. On October 8th, he said in Tokyo that in this age of artificial satellites and atomic energy, mankind can only avoid destruction through peaceful coexistence. Prior to this, Nehru also said that artificial satellites may ease some tensions, because this development makes talking about war and armaments even more absurd.
    Artificial satellites allow peace-loving people all over the world to see that mankind's struggle to conquer nature has entered a completely new stage; the forces defending world peace are unprecedentedly strong. Precisely because of this, hundreds of millions of people around the world are cheering for this great achievement of the Soviet Union with extraordinary excitement.

    The US Ruling Group is Panicked and Disturbed
    However, the news of the successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite caused panic and confusion among the ruling group in the United States. As the "New York Herald Tribune" reported, Washington's "reaction to the Soviet Earth satellite message was a wail, believing that in this epic race of the twentieth century, the United States' honor was lost all at once." Senator Symington called the shock caused by this news the fifth major shock in the United States since the Soviet Union made the atomic bomb, the hydrogen bomb, jet airliners, and intercontinental missiles, and it is obviously the biggest shock. Many members of Congress immediately demanded an investigation into why the United States lagged behind the Soviet Union, and the Army in charge of the missile program and the Navy in charge of the artificial satellite program also launched attacks on each other.
    The arrogance of the US ruling group made it completely underestimate the strength of Soviet science and technology. As Agence France-Presse revealed, when the Soviet Union announced in June this year that an artificial satellite would be launched in a few months, Washington "couldn't help but laugh." But now this artificial satellite has flown over their heads again and again. Moreover, the weight of this artificial satellite is 83.6 kilograms, which is eight and a half times the weight of the artificial satellite that the United States claims to be preparing to launch next year. This means that the Soviet Union has greatly surpassed the United States in rocket technology for launching artificial satellites. This could not but greatly surprise the US ruling group, which considers everything first from the perspective of the US military's aggressive purposes.
    Hagen, the person in charge of the US artificial satellite program, undisguisedly stated this fear. He said that this may mean that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States not only in the boundaries of space, but also in intercontinental ballistic missiles. Senator Mansfield also believes that this shows that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in intercontinental ballistic missiles, "We no longer live in an environment that our country can call privileged security... We will be in a position to a greater extent than Western Europe..."
    In a word, the United States is not only lagging behind the Soviet Union in the development of science and technology, but also its "position of strength" policy has completely failed. A major change has taken place in the balance of world power. The US ruling group is trying its best to conceal this fact. The US Information Agency's propaganda instructions to the US propaganda machine regarding the Soviet artificial satellite are to only report that this is a new development in world science, and to downplay its military significance.
    However, this cannot be concealed. The whole world has seen it. India's "Free Press" said, "The balance of military power has shifted in favor of the Soviet Union... Washington will inevitably have to undergo a painful reassessment." An Egyptian newspaper believes that the Soviet artificial satellite has destroyed the Eisenhower Doctrine. Japan's Kyodo News also believes that the Soviet Union's series of achievements have shaken the United States' political and military position. Even the "New York Times" could not help but anxiously ask: Has a fundamental change taken place in the world's balance of power?
    The US "policy of strength" has suffered a fatal blow, and the trend of peace and neutrality has gained strong encouragement. West Germany's "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" pointed out that "the United States is worried that the so-called underdeveloped countries may be more inclined to neutralism than before." According to UPI, US diplomats are also afraid that the new developments in the situation "will strengthen neutralist forces." Reflecting this concern of the United States, West Germany's Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union hurriedly issued a statement calling on Western countries to "unite" to cope with the situation. Interestingly, even in West Germany, some people believe that peaceful coexistence is necessary. West Germany's "Die Welt" said that it hopes that "the West will realize that coexistence is not the worst thing." And after the shock, Japan's political and business circles began to believe that "the political, economic, and factual foundations on which they have unconditionally relied on in the past may have been shaken." Japanese diplomatic authorities also made an estimate that the US "diplomacy of strength line may collapse fundamentally."

    There is Only One Way Out: Peaceful Coexistence
    For the US ruling group, the situation is indeed very bad. But it is still trying to struggle. The US ruling group is trying its best to belittle the significance of the Soviet artificial satellite. US Chief of Naval Operations Burke even tried to describe this artificial satellite as "a large piece of iron" that almost anyone could launch. This nonsense of Burke's was quickly criticized by Britain's "Daily Mail" as "the most stupid" statement of the century, attempting to undermine mankind's great achievement.
    The US ruling group also tried to portray the Soviet Union's great achievements not as a result of the Soviet socialist system and the development of Soviet science and technology, but as if relying on the scientists of Hitler's Germany. Eisenhower specifically spread this lie at a press conference on October 9th. But Dr. Kohler of the West German Rocket and Space Travel Research Association had already refuted this lie on the 7th. Kohler pointed out that the United States was the one that took away the "largest part" and "the most important part" of the German scientists who studied rockets after the war. He pointed out that the United States' fabrication of this lie "is just trying to soothe its injured self-esteem."
    It is useless to belittle the significance of the Soviet Union's achievements. Because the United States itself cannot come up with anything to support its "policy of strength," it has to pretend to greatly promote its "future" artificial satellite program. However, according to the United States itself, what it is preparing to launch in December this year is only a few pounds of lead balls, not an artificial satellite. The artificial satellite scheduled to be launched next spring will also only weigh about ten kilograms.
    Under these circumstances, in order to give itself and its followers a tranquilizer, the US ruling group had to pretend to be at ease and nonchalant, and try its best to promote that the United States has no intention of competing with the Soviet Union, and expressed that the United States is not worried. Eisenhower's speech at a press conference on the 9th, after tense consultations with senior government officials and scientists, was the culmination of this propaganda.
    But at the same time, officials at the US Department of Defense are already talking about the so-called "advancing the armed forces into outer space." American jurist Harley even considered the issue of "sovereignty" in outer space, intending to demand that the moon be declared a "free and independent autonomous region." The ambition of the United States to pursue a "policy of strength" not only on Earth, but also on the Moon and other planets, has been fully exposed. This makes Eisenhower's speech even more ridiculous.
    Facts have proven that the US "policy of strength" cannot even be maintained on Earth, so what is there to talk about a "policy of strength" on the Moon! Now, the only way out for the US ruling group is peaceful coexistence. The only question is whether it has the wisdom and courage to take this path.

　　万家欢庆一家愁
　　顾思
　　世界欢庆人类的伟大成就
    人类历史上第一个人造卫星由苏联在10月4日发射成功了。这个“小月亮”以每九十六分钟环绕地球一周的速度，在北极圈和南极圈之间九百公里到三百公里的高空不断运行。它以它的流星一般的闪光和“噼、噼”的无线电讯号，告诉地球上的人们：人类走向太空的新纪元开始了。这个不容置辩的铁的事实，使每一个人感觉到社会主义制度的无比的优越性，感觉到苏联的科学技术的强大力量。
    全世界爱好和平的人民都为苏联这个辉煌的成就而欢呼。在各个社会主义国家里，不用说，人们把它看成不仅是苏联的成就，也是整个社会主义阵营的成就；人们认为，这是社会主义制度的优越性的具体表现，也是社会主义阵营把强大的科学技术力量用于和平目的的最好证明。就是在资本主义国家里，人们也把苏联的人造卫星看作是人类智慧的杰出的成就，是苏联科学的巨大胜利。许多资产阶级报纸也赞扬苏联发射人造卫星的成功。
    爱好和平的政治家们看到了苏联发射人造卫星成功对于促进世界和平的重大的政治意义，印度尼赫鲁总理的谈话带有很大的代表性。10月8日他在东京说，在这个人造卫星和原子能时代，人类只有通过和平共处才能避免毁灭。在这以前，尼赫鲁还曾说，人造卫星可能使紧张局势有一些缓和，因为这个发展使得谈论战争和军备变成更加荒唐的事了。
    人造卫星使全世界爱好和平的人民看到：人类征服自然的斗争进入了一个全新的阶段；保卫世界和平的力量空前强大。正因为这样，世界亿万人民都在以异常兴奋的心情欢呼苏联的这个伟大成就。
    美国统治集团惊慌不安
    可是，苏联发射人造卫星成功的消息，却在美国统治集团中引起了惊恐和混乱。正如“纽约先驱论坛报”所报道的，华盛顿方面“对苏联地球卫星消息的反应是一片哀叹，认为在二十世纪的这场史诗般的竞赛中，美国的荣誉一下子丧失殆尽了”。参议员薛明顿把这个消息所引起的震惊，称为美国从苏联制成原子弹、氢弹、喷气式客机和洲际导弹以来的第五次大震惊，而且显然也是最大的一次震惊。许多国会议员立即要求调查为什么美国落后于苏联，负责导弹计划的陆军和负责人造卫星计划的海军之间也展开了互相攻击。
    美国统治集团的狂妄自大，使它完全低估了苏联的科学技术力量的雄厚。如法新社所揭露的，在今年6月苏联宣布人造卫星将在几个月内发射时，华盛顿方面曾经“忍不住要笑”。可是现在这个人造卫星已经在他们头上一次又一次地飞过了。而且这个人造卫星的重量是八十三点六公斤，为美国自称准备在明年发射的人造卫星的重量的八倍半。这就是说，苏联在发射人造卫星的火箭技术方面大大超过了美国。这就不能不使把一切都首先从美国的军事侵略目的去考虑的美国统治集团大为吃惊了。
    美国人造卫星计划的负责人哈根不加掩饰地说出了这种恐惧。他说，这可能意味着苏联不仅在空间的边界方面胜过美国，而且在洲际弹道导弹方面也胜过了美国。参议员曼斯菲尔德也认为这说明苏联在洲际弹道导弹方面胜过了美国，“我们不再生活在我国可以称之为特权安全所的环境之中……我们将在更大程度上处于西欧的地位上……”
    一句话，美国不仅在科学技术发展上落后于苏联，而且它的“实力地位”政策彻底破产了。世界力量的对比发生了重大的变化。美国统治集团竭力企图遮掩这个事实。美国新闻署给美国宣传机器关于苏联人造卫星的宣传指示，就是要它们只报道这仅是世界科学的一个新发展，而贬低它在军事上的重要性。
    可是，这是掩盖不住的。全世界都看出来了。印度“自由新闻”说，“军事力量的对比已经转而有利于苏联……华盛顿方面就势非忍痛进行重新估计不可了。”埃及报纸认为，苏联的人造卫星已经摧毁了艾森豪威尔主义。日本共同社也认为，苏联的一系列成就动摇了美国在政治和军事方面的地位。就是“纽约时报”也不能不忧心如焚地问道：世界均势方面是否发生了根本的变化？
    美国“实力政策”受到了致命的打击，和平中立的趋势获得了强有力的鼓舞。西德的“法兰克福总汇报”指出，“美国担心，所谓不发达的国家可能比以前更加倾向中立主义”。据合众社透露，美国外交官员也害怕局势的新发展“会使中立主义力量增强起来”。反映着美国的这种担心，西德阿登纳的基督教民主联盟赶紧发表了一个声明，要求西方国家“团结”起来以应付局势。有意思的是，就在西德，也有人认为非和平共处不可了。西德“世界报”就说，希望“西方将认识到共处并不是一件最坏的事情”。而日本的政界和实业界在震惊之余，开始认为“他们过去无条件地作为凭恃的政治上、经济上、事实上的立足点，恐怕已经发生了动摇”。日本外交权威人士也作出了美国的“实力外交路线，可能从根本上垮台”的估计。
    只有和平共处一条出路
    对于美国统治集团来说，情况的确十分不妙。可是它仍然企图作一番挣扎。美国统治集团竭力企图贬低苏联人造卫星的意义。美国海军作战参谋长贝奈特甚至企图把这个人造卫星说成只是几乎任何人都可以发射的“一大块铁”。贝奈特的这种胡说八道，很快就被英国的“每日邮报”抨击为企图破坏人类的伟大成就的“本世纪中最愚蠢的”说法。
    美国统治集团也企图把苏联的伟大成就说成不是苏联的社会主义制度和苏联科学技术的发展的结果，而似乎是依靠了希特勒德国的科学家的结果。艾森豪威尔在10月9日记者招待会上就特地散布了这种谎言。可是西德的火箭和空间旅行研究会的科勒博士早在7日就驳斥了这种谎言。科勒指出战后把德国研究火箭的科学家的“最大一部分”和“最重要的一部分”带走的正是美国。他指出美国制造这种谎言“只是在设法抚慰受了伤害的自尊心”。
    贬低苏联的成就的意义是没有用的。美国自己因为拿不出东西来支撑它的“实力政策”，只好装模作样地大肆宣传它的“未来的”人造卫星计划了。可是，据美国自己说，它在今年12月间准备发射的不过是几磅重的铅球而不是人造卫星。预定明年春天发射的人造卫星，也只有十公斤左右的重量。
    在这种情况下，美国统治集团为了给自己和它的追随者服一副镇静剂，就只好装出心安理得的无所谓的样子，竭力宣传美国无意同苏联竞赛，表示美国并不担忧。艾森豪威尔经过同政府高级官员和科学家们紧张会商以后，9日在记者招待会上发表的谈话，就是这个宣传的顶点。
    可是与此同时，美国国防部的官员们却已经在谈论所谓“把武装部队推进到外层空间”的问题。美国的法学家哈莱甚至考虑到了宇宙空间的“主权”问题，打算要求宣布月亮为“自由和独立的自治地区”。美国不但要在地球上、而且要在月亮和其他星球上推行“实力政策”的野心，已经暴露无遗。这就使得艾森豪威尔的谈话更加显得可笑万分。
    事实已经证明：美国的“实力政策”在地球上尚且保不住，还谈什么月球上的“实力政策”呢！现在摆在美国统治集团面前的，只有和平共处一条出路。问题只是它是不是有走这条路的明智和勇气罢了。
