　　A Miracle in Bridge History
　　Mao Yisheng, President of the Railway Science Research Institute

    The Yangtze River is Asia's largest river, and the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is Asia's largest bridge. Today, the inauguration and opening ceremony of this Asia's largest bridge over Asia's largest river is being held in Wuhan, realizing the dream of the Chinese people for thousands of years. This is an unprecedentedly glorious and joyous event in China's transportation history. As a bridge technologist, I am even more excited about the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Before liberation, bridge workers had made some suggestions, surveys, explorations, and designs for building a bridge in Wuhan. I myself participated in the design and wrote a proposal, but under the reactionary rule, all of this was in vain and just empty talk on paper. Once China was liberated, there was hope for building a bridge in Wuhan, and today it has become a reality. Why did the ideals of the people for thousands of years and the repeated surveys by bridge workers ultimately come to nothing before liberation, but were rapidly realized after liberation? There is only one answer: because we have the leadership of the great Communist Party and an advanced socialist system.

    Recalling bridge building before liberation, it was truly fraught with difficulties and slow progress. When one unit built a bridge, other departments either stood by idly or even sabotaged it, and there was no cooperation at all. Today, the situation is different. The socialist system guarantees the cooperation and coordination of all departments. After the Central People's Government announced its decision to build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, all departments fully cooperated, and all parts of the country actively supported it. This kind of concerted action was never seen in the past. When it comes to the use of manpower and resources, it is even more incomparable. Before liberation, China also built some relatively large bridges, but with the exception of a very few designed by Chinese people and contracted for some of the work, the rest were all contracted by foreigners, using foreign engineers, foreign materials, foreign machines, and foreign loans. Today's Wuhan Bridge, despite being larger in scale and more difficult to construct, is completely different. It is designed by Chinese engineers, using Chinese steel, Chinese machines, Chinese materials, manufactured in China, and built entirely with Chinese financial resources. This is unprecedented in the history of Chinese bridge building. If it were not for the smooth implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, if it were not for the gradual establishment of the preliminary foundation of socialist industrialization, the supply of steel, machines, cement, timber, electricity, and all other equipment and materials required for bridge construction would not have been able to keep up with the progress of the project. If it were not for the unparalleled enthusiasm and numerous inventions of the masses under the socialist system, the bridge would not have been completed ahead of schedule, and the results of high quality and low cost would not have been achieved. Furthermore, in terms of cultivating technical personnel, we did not even have a basic technical force in the decades before liberation. During the construction of the Wuhan Bridge, however, a large number of bridge technical cadres were trained one after another, enough to meet the needs of ten bridge construction sites today, laying the foundation for future human resources in bridge technology. With such manpower and resources, China's future bridge undertakings can be fully developed.

    The completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has opened a new era in bridge technology. Building bridge piers on rock formations as deep as 45 meters, with high water periods lasting seven or eight months each year, plus other unfavorable hydrological, meteorological, and geological conditions, is a rare and arduous project in bridge history. The steel beam manufacturing and erection, the construction of approach bridges and connecting lines, all include structural engineering on a massive scale and with complex content. But such a magnificent building was completed in a historically unprecedented short period of two years! This shows that China's bridge technology has reached a high level of development, so that, with the initiative and assistance of Soviet experts, it was possible to successfully complete the crucial bridge pier construction with the creative new technology of large tubular column drilling. Among these new technologies, using large reinforced concrete tubes, using vibration pile drivers, combined with water jetting, to sink them, and then using a cross-shaped arc-shaped drill bit inside the tube to drill holes in the rock formation, placing steel cages in the holes, and finally filling the drilled holes and empty tubes with underwater concrete, is the first application in the history of bridge building in the world. After many experiments and studies, it has now been proven that this new technology is not only suitable for the Wuhan Bridge, but also for other bridges; not only suitable for bridges, but also for other underwater constructions; compared with the original various underwater construction methods, better, faster, and more economical results can be obtained.

    The completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has shocked the world, especially the capitalist countries. In the past two years, due to my participation in international conferences and group visits, I have given public lectures on the construction technology of this bridge in capitalist countries such as Japan, Italy, France, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. Many people in the audience thought that China's economy and science have always been very backward, but today it can build this Asia's largest bridge with its own manpower, resources, and financial resources, and they were very surprised. In particular, the fact that China's technical strength has developed to the point where it can carry out construction in the deep and rapid currents of the Yangtze River is deeply admired. The speed at which we build bridges is even more astonishing to them, and they all believe that this is impossible in their own countries, to the point of being almost unbelievable; but in reality, my reports are always behind the progress of the construction. For example, when I reported in Tokyo in December 1955, I said that two pier cofferdams had been launched, but in fact, four had already been launched at that time. Last year, in my reports in various countries, I always said that the bridge would be completed by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. In the printed documents I took to the meeting in London in August this year, I changed it to say that it would be open to traffic in September this year, but in fact, a trial opening was made on August 15.

    The completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is a great victory for the socialist system and a crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship. We have built the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and we will certainly be able to build more bridges that are as large in scale and as technically complex as the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.

　　桥梁史上的奇迹
　　铁道科学研究院院长　茅以升
    长江是亚洲第一大河，武汉长江大桥是亚洲第一大桥。今天这座亚洲第一大河上的亚洲第一大桥在武汉举行落成通车典礼，中国人民数千年来的梦想实现了。这是我国交通史上空前辉煌的一件大喜事，作为一个桥梁技术工作者，我对武汉长江大桥的建成，更感到无比的兴奋。解放以前，桥梁工作者对在武汉建桥也曾有过一些建议、勘测、钻探和设计，我自己也曾参加过设计并写过计划书，但在反动统治下，这一切都是徒劳的，都只是纸上空谈。中国一解放，武汉建桥就有了希望，今天更成为事实。为什么人民几千年来的理想，桥梁工作者三番五次的勘测，在解放前终成泡影，解放后却迅速付诸实现了呢？回答只有一个：因为我们有伟大的共产党领导，有先进的社会主义制度。
    回忆解放前造桥，真是困难重重、寸步难行。一个单位造桥，其他部门有的袖手旁观，有的甚至从中破坏，根本谈不到协作配合。今天情况不同了，社会主义制度保证各个部门的配合协作。中央人民政府修建武汉长江大桥的决定公布后，各个部门充分合作，全国各地积极支援。这种一致行动，是过去从来不曾有过的。谈到人力、物力的使用，更是不可同日而语。解放以前，我国也建造过一些比较大的桥梁，但其中除极少数是由我国人设计并承包一部分工程而外，其余都是由外国人包办一切，用外国工程师，外国材料，外国机器和外国借款建造的。今天的武汉大桥，尽管规模比前大，工程更困难，却完全不同了，它是由我国工程师设计，用我国钢铁，我国机器，我国材料，在我国制造，并且全部用我国财力建成的。这在中国桥梁史上是前所未有的。如若不是第一个五年计划的顺利实施，如若不是社会主义工业化初步基础的逐步奠定，大桥施工所需的钢铁、机器、水泥、木料、电力以及一切其他器材设备的供应，是不可能赶上工程进度的。如若不是在社会主义制度下，群众积极性无比高涨，创造发明多不胜数，大桥也是不可能提前完工，并且取得了质量高、造价低的成果的。再从培养技术力量来说，解放前几十年间，我们还没有一支起码的技术力量，在武汉大桥施工期间，却先后训练出大批的桥梁技术干部，到今天已足敷十个桥梁工地之用，奠定了今后桥梁技术上的人力基础。有了这样的人力物力，我国今后的桥梁事业，就能充分发展。
    武汉长江大桥的建成开辟了桥梁技术的一个新纪元。在水深达四十五公尺的岩层上建筑桥墩，而深水时期每年达七八个月之久，再加其他种种不利的水文气象和地质条件，是桥梁史上罕见的艰巨工程。这座桥的钢梁制造与架设，引桥和联络线的修建，都包括规模巨大、内容复杂的结构工程。但是这样宏伟的建筑竟然在史无前例的短短二年时间内全部完成了！这说明我国桥梁技术已经有了高度的发展，因而在苏联专家的创议和协助下，能以大型管柱钻孔法的创造性的新技术，来胜利完成关键性的桥墩建筑。在这些新技术中，用大型的钢筋混凝土管，以震动打桩机，配合射水，使之下沉，然后在管内用十字带弧形的钻头，向岩层钻孔，在孔内放钢筋笼架，最后以水下混凝土将钻孔等空管填满，是世界桥梁史上第一次应用的。经过多次试验和研究，现在已经证明，这种新技术不但适用于武汉大桥，而且也适用于其他桥梁；不但适用于桥梁，而且也适用于其他各种水下建筑；比起原有的各种水下施工方法，都能得到更好、更快、更省的结果。
    武汉长江大桥的建成震惊了全世界，特别是资本主义国家。近两年来，我因参加国际会议和团体访问，曾在日本、意大利、法国、葡萄牙和英国等资本主义国家作过关于这座大桥的施工技术的公开讲演。听众中很多人都以为中国的经济和科学向来非常落后，但在今天竟能以自己的人力、物力和财力来修建这座亚洲第一大桥，感到万分惊奇。特别是我国的技术力量已经发展到足以在长江深水急流中施工的程度，敬佩不已。我们修桥的速度更使他们惊异，都认为这在他们本国是不可能的事，以致几乎达到难以相信的地步；而实际上我的报告还总是落后于施工进度的。例如1955年12月在东京报告时，我说桥墩围囹已有两个下水，但实际上那时已有四个下水了。去年我在各国的报告里，总说大桥要在今年年底或明年年初完工，今年8月往伦敦开会所带的印发文稿中就改说要在今年9月通车，但实际上，在8月15日就试行通车了。
    武汉长江大桥的建成，是社会主义制度的伟大胜利，是中苏友谊的结晶。我们建成了武汉长江大桥，也一定能建成更多的、像武汉长江大桥一样规模巨大、技术复杂的桥梁。
