Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 25th: Albanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Shehu, said on the afternoon of the 24th that the Albanian government and people fully support the just struggle of the fraternal Syrian people and condemn the imperialist aggression against Syria.

Shehu made these remarks at a mass rally welcoming Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Zhukov.

Albanian Labor Party Central Committee First Secretary Hoxha also said at a grand banquet held for Zhukov on the 23rd that the Albanian people protest the attempt by American imperialism and its ally Turkey to enslave the fraternal Syrian people. Hoxha pointed out that the Syrian issue has become an issue for all peace-loving people. The peace-loving Albanian people stand with the Syrian people, the Egyptian people, the Arab people, and all people who defend independence and freedom and oppose imperialist colonial oppression.

Marshal Zhukov said at the banquet that if a war against Syria breaks out, the Soviet Union will not sit idly by; the Soviet government will resolutely strive to stop the war, and if necessary, it will take all measures to stop the crazy aggression. Zhukov also said that Turkey, serving the United States, plays an important role in this bloody aggression plan, playing with fire, but it does not care about the interests of the people, nor does it see the disasters it faces. The Soviet government's declared stance against adventurers will surely be supported by socialist countries and all peace-loving people.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 25th: According to a Syrian government press bulletin, Yugoslav Ambassador to Syria, Zore, visited Syrian Acting Foreign Minister Kalas on October 24th and conveyed the Yugoslav government's support for Syria's struggle against imperialism and its support for Syria's accusation to the United Nations against Turkey for assembling troops on its border.

    朱可夫说苏联坚决制止侵叙战争
    谢胡和霍查表示和叙利亚站在一起
    南斯拉夫支持叙利亚对土耳其控诉
    据新华社地拉那25日电　阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡24日下午说，阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民完全支持兄弟的叙利亚人民的正义斗争，谴责帝国主义对叙利亚的侵略目的。
    谢胡是在欢迎苏联国防部长朱可夫元帅的群众大会讲这些话的。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记霍查在23日为朱可夫举行的盛大酒会上也说，阿尔巴尼亚人民抗议美帝国主义和它的同盟者土耳其企图奴役兄弟的叙利亚人民。霍查指出，叙利亚问题已经成为所有爱好和平人民的问题了。爱好和平的阿尔巴尼亚人民同叙利亚人民、埃及人民、阿拉伯人民以及所有保卫独立和自由、反对帝国主义殖民压迫的人民站在一起。
    朱可夫元帅在酒会上讲话说，如果发生了反对叙利亚的战争，苏联将不会坐视；苏联政府坚决为制止战争而努力，如果需要的话，它将采取一切措施来制止疯狂的侵略。朱可夫还说，在这个血腥的侵略计划内，为美国服务的土耳其扮演了重要的角色，玩弄着战火，但是它却没有关心人民的利益，也没有看到面临的灾难。苏联政府所宣称的反对冒险者的立场一定会得到社会主义国家和所有爱好和平人民的支持。
    新华社大马士革25日电　据叙利亚政府新闻处公报说，南斯拉夫驻叙利亚大使佐雷10月24日访问了叙利亚代理外交部长卡拉斯，向他转达了南斯拉夫政府支持叙利亚反对帝国主义的斗争，支持叙利亚向联合国提出的指责土耳其在它边境集结军队的控诉的态度。
