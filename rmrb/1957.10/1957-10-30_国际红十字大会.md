    International Red Cross Conference
    The 19th International Red Cross Conference has already opened on October 28 in New Delhi, India. Representatives or observers from the governments and Red Cross societies of eighty-three countries, including the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, North Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, India, Egypt, Syria, the United States, and the United Kingdom, are participating in the conference.
    The International Red Cross Conference is a meeting attended by all different systems of Red Cross organizations worldwide. It consists of: 1. Representatives of the governments of the signatory countries to the 1864 Geneva Convention for the Protection of War Victims (also known as the International Red Cross Convention, which China signed and recognized in 1906); 2. Representatives of national Red Cross Societies, Red Crescent Societies (Islamic countries), or Red Lion and Sun Societies (Iran) recognized by the governments of these countries; 3. Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross; 4. Representatives of the Red Cross Societies Association.
    The International Red Cross Conference is the highest deliberative body of the International Red Cross. Its session is usually convened once every four years. The executive body during the intersessional period is the Standing Commission. The Standing Commission is composed of five people elected by the conference, two representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and two representatives of the Red Cross Societies Association.
    The first International Red Cross Conference was held in Paris, France, in 1867. Up to 1938, a total of sixteen conferences had been held. Due to the impact of World War II, the seventeenth conference was not held until 1948 in Stockholm, Sweden.
    The 18th International Red Cross Conference was held in Toronto, Canada, in 1952. China dispatched a government delegation headed by Su Jingguan and a Red Cross delegation headed by Li Dequan to participate. Under the manipulation of the United States, the Standing Commission violated the International Red Cross Charter and organizational principles, infringed upon the rights of the Chinese people, and invited elements of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan to participate. China once lodged a serious protest against this, forcing the Chiang Kai-shek clique elements to quietly slip out of the venue. Representatives of China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and various people's democratic countries fully exposed and severely condemned the United States' crimes of violating humanity and undermining various Geneva Conventions in the war of aggression against Korea. The adoption of Poland's proposal on the prohibition of bacteriological and chemical weapons marked one of the achievements of the conference.
    Before the current conference was held, Standing Commission Chairman François-Poncet (French) again, under the instructions of the US delegation, disregarded the opposition of the majority of the committee members and, by misappropriating the name of the Standing Commission, arbitrarily sent a telegram asking the Chiang Kai-shek clique to send people to participate in the conference. Li Dequan, head of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, lodged a strong protest at the conference on behalf of the Chinese government delegation and the Chinese Red Cross delegation.

    国际红十字大会
    第十九届国际红十字大会已经于10月28日在印度新德里举行。参加大会的有苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、朝鲜、越南、蒙古、印度、埃及、叙利亚、美国、英国等八十三个国家的政府和红十字会的代表或观察员。
    国际红十字大会是全世界所有不同系统的红十字组织参加的会议。它由：一、1864年保护战争受难者日内瓦公约（又称国际红十字公约，中国在1906年签字承认）各缔约国政府的代表；二、这些国家的政府承认的全国性红十字会、红新月会（伊斯兰教国家）或红狮与太阳会（伊朗）的代表；三、红十字国际委员会的代表；四、红十字会协会的代表共同组成。
    国际红十字大会是国际红十字的最高审议机构。它的会期通常是每四年召开一次。大会闭会期间的执行机构是常设委员会。常设委员会由大会选举五人和红十字国际委员会代表二人、红十字会协会代表二人组成。
    第一届国际红十字大会于1867年在法国巴黎召开。到1938年为止共开过十六次大会。由于第二次世界大战的影响，直至1948年才在瑞典的斯德哥尔摩举行第十七届大会。
    1952年第十八届国际红十字大会在加拿大多伦多召开，中国派遣了以苏井观为首的政府代表团和李德全为首的红十字会代表团参加。大会常设委员会在美国操纵下，违背国际红十字章程和组织原则，侵犯中国人民的权利，邀请了台湾蒋介石集团分子参加。我国曾经就此提出严重的抗议，迫使蒋介石集团分子悄悄溜出会场。中、苏、朝和各人民民主国家的代表在大会上，对美国在侵略朝鲜的战争中，违反人道，破坏日内瓦各项公约的罪行，提出了充分的揭露和严厉的谴责。大会通过的波兰提出的关于禁止细菌武器与化学武器等提案标志着大会的成就之一。
    在本届大会举行以前，常设委员会主席弗朗索瓦—庞赛（法国人）又在美国代表团的指示下，不顾大多数委员的反对，盗用常设委员会的名义，擅自打电报要蒋介石集团派人参加大会。中国红十字会代表团团长李德全在大会上代表中国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团提出强烈的抗议。　　（新华社）
