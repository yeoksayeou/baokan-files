Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 20th: Soviet technological experience has played an important role in transforming old enterprises in Shanghai. Thanks to the promotion of new Soviet technologies and the help of Soviet experts, the potential of Shanghai's original industrial equipment has been greatly tapped in the past few years.

Soviet experts who came to Shanghai to assist in the work attached great importance to the full utilization of existing equipment. Shanghai's iron and steel industry, for example, was developed into a domestic small steel base with the help of Soviet experts, based on the original dilapidated and incomplete foundations. From 1952 to September of this year, more than sixty Soviet experts came to various factories of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company to impart their experience, putting forward more than 1,600 suggestions. These suggestions played an extremely important role in increasing the steel output of various factories and increasing the variety of steel products.

In the low, corrugated iron sheds of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, only plows, harrows and threshing machines could be manufactured before liberation. After liberation, with the help of Soviet experts, the factory produced a large number of precision grinders. During the First Five-Year Plan, they had successfully trial-produced 27 types of Soviet-style grinders based on Soviet blueprints and product samples. They also designed and trial-produced a Chinese model grinder with the help of Soviet experts. Many old factories in Shanghai and small factories located in the alleyways, like the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, have produced a large number of precision and high-end products in recent years, thanks to the technical data and assistance from Soviet experts.

In the textile industry, in recent years, Shanghai's textile factories have promoted many Soviet experiences related to shortening the spinning process and increasing the output per unit area of ​​the factory, further tapping the potential of the original equipment and reducing production costs. Among them, merely adopting the Soviet experience of "all-metal needle cloth," according to the results of tests in two factories, can increase the production efficiency of the original carding machines by about 30%.

Soviet experts also actively helped Shanghai's industrial departments to tap the potential of existing equipment through economic reorganization. Khramov, chief engineer of the Moscow Paint Factory, suggested absorbing the small paint factories in Shanghai around the large paint factories, which would facilitate management and make full use of their equipment, and put forward some specific suggestions for mutual adjustment of equipment. According to the principles put forward by Soviet experts, the Shanghai Dyestuff Industrial Company merged twenty-four small factories producing by hand and semi-manual methods into two larger factories, converting to machine production, thereby greatly improving product quality and labor productivity.

    采用苏联技术经验
    上海旧企业面貌改观
    新华社上海20日电　苏联的技术经验在改造上海旧企业的过程中起了重要的作用。由于苏联新技术的推广和苏联专家的帮助，上海工业原有设备的潜力在过去的几年里得到了大大发挥。
    来上海帮助工作的苏联专家，对充分利用原有设备都很重视。上海钢铁工业就是经过苏联专家的帮助，在原来残缺破旧的基础上发展成为国内的小型钢材基地的。从1952年到今年9月，有六十几位苏联专家先后来上海钢铁公司各厂传授经验，他们提出了各种建议一千六百多条。这些建议对于提高各厂钢产量和增加钢材品种，起了极为重要的作用。
    在上海机床厂低矮的铁皮活动房子里，解放前仅能制造犁耙和打谷机。解放后这个工厂在苏联专家的帮助下却生产了大批精密磨床。第一个五年计划期间，他们已经根据苏联的图纸和产品实样试制成功了二十七种仿苏式磨床，还在苏联专家帮助下自行设计和试制成功了一种中国型号的磨床。上海许多陈旧的老厂和座落在弄堂里的小厂，都像上海机床厂那样由于得到了苏联的技术资料和苏联专家的帮助，几年来生产了大批精密的、高级的产品。
    在纺织工业方面，几年来，上海的纺织厂推广了很多项有关缩短纺纱的工艺过程和提高厂房单位面积产量等方面的苏联经验，进一步发挥了原有设备的潜力，降低了生产成本。其中，单是采用苏联“全金属针布”的经验，根据两个厂试验的结果，原有梳棉机的生产效率就可以提高30％左右。
    苏联专家还积极帮助上海工业部门通过经济改组的方式，来发挥原有设备的潜力。莫斯科油漆厂总工程师赫拉莫夫建议把上海的小造漆厂吸收在大造漆厂的周围，便于管理和充分利用它们的设备，并且提出了一些互相调整设备的具体建议。上海市染料工业公司根据苏联专家所提出的原则，把二十四户手工和半手工生产的小厂并入两家较大的工厂，改为机器生产，从而大大提高了产品质量和劳动生产率。
