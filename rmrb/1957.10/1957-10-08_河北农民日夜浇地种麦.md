Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th. Hebei Province farmers have planted over 11 million mu of wheat while combating drought. Currently, some areas are still irrigating and planting wheat day and night.

Many agricultural cooperatives in the Cangxian Special District began sowing after the White Dew solar term, about ten days earlier than in previous years, and have now completed 35% of their wheat planting plan. In Wuqiang County, more than 90% of the 156 agricultural cooperatives are using manpower instead of animal power, freeing up livestock for plowing and planting wheat. In order to utilize soil moisture to ensure emergence, members of various cooperatives tied straw bundles to the legs of seed drills during sowing, pushing dry soil to the sides and planting the wheat seeds in the moist soil. In Jiaocheng County, 210 agricultural cooperatives are irrigating day and night, having planted more than 50,000 mu of wheat. Many agricultural cooperatives are building sheds in the fields to plant wheat in order to save travel time. In the midst of combating drought and planting wheat, water conservancy work has been carried out throughout the province, expanding the wheat planting area. According to incomplete statistics from twelve counties including Shen County, Handan, and Qiuxian, more than 247,000 mu of wheat have already been planted.

    河北农民日夜浇地种麦
    新华社保定7日电　河北省农民在抗旱中种下麦子一千一百多万亩。现在，有些地方还在日夜不停地浇地种麦。
    沧县专区很多农业社在白露节后就开始播种，比往年提前十天左右，目前已完成种麦计划的35％。武强县一百五十六个农业社，90％以上的社以人力代替畜力，抽出畜力耕地种麦。为了利用墒土保证出苗，播种时，各地社员将草把绑在耧腿上，把干土推向两旁，把麦粒种在墒土里。交河县二百一十个农业社日夜不停地浇地，已种麦五万多亩。许多农业社为了节省工作的往返时间，在地里搭棚种麦。在抗旱种麦中，全省各地开展了水利工作，扩大种麦面积。据深县、邯郸、丘县等十二个县的不完全统计，已经种麦二十四万七千多亩。
