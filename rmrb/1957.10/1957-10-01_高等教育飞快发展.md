Xinhua News Agency, 30th: China's higher education has experienced rapid development in the eight years since liberation.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Higher Education, the number of students currently enrolled in universities and colleges across the country has nearly tripled compared to 1947, the year with the highest number of higher education students before liberation, totaling 447,000. After liberation, the number of higher education students increased by an average of 41,250 each year, which is 13.2 times the average annual increase in the fifty years before liberation. Among them, the number of engineering students increased by an average of 20,700 each year, which is 37.3 times the average annual increase in the fifty years before liberation. In these eight years, universities and colleges across the country have trained a total of 369,000 graduates for the country, which is 150,000 more than the total number of higher education graduates in the fifty years before liberation. At the same time, the quality of students has also improved year by year.

The government gives preferential treatment with equal conditions to the laboring people and their children, who had very little opportunity to receive higher education before liberation, and has set up scholarships for them. In the past eight years, 150,000 laboring people and their children have received higher education.

The state has also established eleven colleges and universities specifically for ethnic minorities. By the end of last year, the number of ethnic minority students in universities and colleges had reached 14,000, an increase of more than eleven times compared to 1950.

The distribution of universities and colleges and the proportion of departments have gradually changed the old face in the past eight years. The higher education of old China reflected the political and economic characteristics of a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. The vast majority of schools were abnormally concentrated in large coastal cities, and the proportion of departments such as literature, law, and commerce was large, while the proportion of departments such as engineering, agriculture, science, medicine, and teacher training was very small. Since the large-scale adjustment of departments in 1952, the distribution of universities and colleges in my country has gradually become more reasonable. By 1956, the number of universities and colleges in the inland areas had increased from 87 to 114, with faster increases in the northeast, northwest and other key construction areas. Around 1953, various types of schools gradually replaced the original methods of training by departments with methods of training by specialty. This year, universities and colleges across the country have set up more than 300 specialties, including 191 engineering specialties. In the past four years, various types of schools have newly established 148 specialties, such as long-distance automatic devices and mechanical equipment, industrial electronics, and geochemistry, which were not available in my country's academic field.

Since the comprehensive teaching reform work of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and combining it with China's actual situation was carried out in the second half of 1952, the ideology of the working class has gained a leading position in the schools in recent years. The courses in the schools, which were originally complicated and contained a wide variety of content, have been incorporated into scientific teaching plans and teaching syllabuses. A new teaching system has been established in universities and colleges, basically implementing the policy of comprehensive development and implementing teaching methods that link theory with practice.

Scientific research work in universities and colleges is also developing year by year. In 1953, only more than 4,000 teachers across the country participated in scientific research, with more than 3,300 research topics. This year, more than 23,000 teachers participated in scientific research, and the number of research topics increased to more than 20,000. These researches are all closely combined with the current construction needs of the country, and are carried out in an organized and planned manner with the support of the state in terms of human, material, and time resources.

    高等教育飞快发展
    全国高等学校在校学生共四十四万七千人，比解放前高等学校学生最多的一九四七年超过近两倍；八年中培养了三十六万九千名毕业生，比解放前五十年的高等学校毕业生总数多十五万人；有十五万劳动人民和劳动人民的子弟受到高等教育。
    新华社30日讯  新中国的高等教育事业在解放后八年中有了飞跃的发展。
    据高等教育部统计，现在全国高等学校在校学生比解放前高等学校学生最多的1947年超过近两倍，共四十四万七千人。解放后，高等学校学生平均每年增加四万一千二百五十人，等于解放前五十年中平均每年增加数的十三点二倍；其中工科学生平均每年增加两万零七百人，等于解放前五十年中平均每年增加数的三十七点三倍。这八年中，全国高等学校共为国家培养了三十六万九千名毕业生，比解放前五十年中的高等学校毕业生总数多十五万人；同时学生的质量也逐年都有提高。
    对于解放前很难有受高等教育机会的劳动人民和他们的子女，政府给予同等条件优先录取的优待，并且为他们设置了助学金。在八年中，有十五万劳动人民和劳动人民的子弟受到高等教育。
    国家还专为少数民族设立了十一所高等学校。在去年年底，高等学校中少数民族学生已达一万四千人，比1950年增加十一倍多。
    高等学校的分布和科系的比重，在八年中逐渐改变了旧有的面貌。旧中国的高等教育反映着半殖民地半封建社会的政治、经济特点，绝大部分学校畸形地集中在沿海大城市，科系设置以文、法、商等科的比重为大，工、农、理、医、师范等院系的比重很小。从1952年开始大规模的院系调整以来，我国高等学校的分布逐渐趋向合理。到1956年，内地高等学校已由八十七所增加到一百一十四所，东北、西北等建设重点地区增加得更快。1953年前后，各类学校逐步用按专业培养的方法来代替了原来的按系、科培养的方法。到今年，全国高等学校已设有三百多种专业，其中工科各专业有一百九十一种。四年来各类学校新设的专业有一百四十八种，其中如远距离自动装置和机械装备、工业电子学、地球化学等，都是我国学术领域中原来没有的。
    学习苏联先进经验、结合中国实际情况的全面的教学改革工作从1952年下半年开展后，几年来工人阶级思想在学校中已取得领导地位。学校中原来头绪纷繁、内容庞杂的课程，已经纳入合乎科学系统的教学计划和教学大纲。一套新的教学制度已经在高等学校中建立起来，基本上贯彻了全面发展的方针，实行了理论联系实际的教学方法。
    高等学校中的科学研究工作也一年比一年发展。1953年，全国参加科学研究的教师仅四千多人，研究题目三千三百多项。到今年有两万三千多教师参加科学研究，研究题目增加到两万多项。这些研究都是紧密结合国家当前建设需要，有组织、有计划地在国家给予人力、物力、时间等支援下进行的。
