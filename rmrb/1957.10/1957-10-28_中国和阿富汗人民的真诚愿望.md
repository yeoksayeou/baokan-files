　　In the past few days, the people of our country, with great excitement, warmly welcomed and received Sardar Mohammed Daoud, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, and the distinguished guests accompanying him. We also expressed our heartfelt gratitude for Prime Minister Daoud’s sincere wish to bring the friendship of the Afghan people to the people of our country and to further strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries.

　　During his stay in Beijing, Prime Minister Daoud met with Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders of our country, and held friendly talks with Premier Zhou Enlai. In the joint communiqué issued by the two prime ministers, they reaffirmed the contents of the joint communiqué issued in Kabul on January 22 this year, and reiterated their desire and determination to further strengthen the friendly ties between the two countries. They also exchanged views on issues of common concern to the two countries and discussed the current international situation. Noting the characteristics of their respective national systems and international policies, they expressed their common desire to maintain world peace. The close contact between the leaders of our two countries will undoubtedly lead to a wider development of the traditional friendship between our two countries on a new basis, and will also have a beneficial impact on the cause of peace and friendship in Asia, Africa and the world.

　　The people of China and Afghanistan are both peace-loving people who cherish freedom and independence. Our two countries are not only close neighbors with a long history of economic and cultural ties, but also share many similarities in the fate of suffering from imperialist oppression in modern times and in the paths we have taken in striving for our respective national independence and freedom. The Afghan people have waged a long and heroic struggle to maintain their national independence and oppose imperialist aggression, earning the sympathy and respect of all freedom-loving people. Afghanistan's current policy of peace and neutrality and developing friendly relations with all countries is playing an increasingly important role in easing international tensions and promoting understanding and trust among countries. The Chinese people, like the Afghan people, are determined to safeguard their country's independence, defend peace, and cherish friendly relations with the people of all countries. The basic policy pursued by our government in its foreign policy is a policy of peace. The Chinese people are willing to cooperate in a friendly manner with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It is precisely because of these many common characteristics and aspirations between our two countries that the friendly relations between our two countries are consolidated and can be continuously developed through mutual exchanges.

　　In the joint communiqué, the two prime ministers reaffirmed their belief in the principles set forth in the final communiqué of the Asian-African Conference, and at the same time hoped to strengthen the spirit of solidarity among Asian and African countries and other parts of the world in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, and believed that atomic energy should only be used for peaceful purposes to benefit mankind. This once again expressed the firm determination of the Chinese and Afghan peoples to maintain peace in Asia and Africa and the world, strengthen friendly cooperation among countries, and oppose imperialist aggression.

　　Since the Bandung Conference, the unity of Asian and African countries has been greatly strengthened, and the struggle of Asian and African regions to maintain national independence and oppose imperialist aggression has been greatly developed. Especially in the Middle East, the people of Arab countries have launched a heroic struggle against Western colonialism in order to defend national independence and peace, causing heavy blows to colonialism. However, the colonialist conspiracy to invade Asian and African countries will never be automatically abandoned. They are now continuing to create tensions in the Middle East. The United States is instigating Turkish troops to assemble on the Syrian border and is constantly creating provocative incidents in an attempt to take the opportunity to ignite the flames of aggression against Syria. This seriously threatens the peace and security of Syria and other Arab countries. The United States is adopting the method of splitting the unity of Arab countries and splitting the unity of Arab countries with other Asian and African countries in order to achieve its ambition of pursuing the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggressive policy in the Middle East and seizing the oil wealth of the Middle East countries. The Chinese people firmly believe that as long as the Arab countries and all other Asian and African countries strengthen their unity on the basis of the principles stipulated in the Bandung Conference and support the just struggle of the Syrian and Arab peoples, the US aggressive attempt in the Middle East will also be shamefully defeated.

　　Prime Minister Daoud and the Afghan distinguished guests accompanying him left Beijing yesterday to visit various parts of our country. We sincerely wish the distinguished guests good health and happiness, and sincerely congratulate the growing friendship between China and Afghanistan.

    中国和阿富汗人民的真诚愿望
    这几天来，我国人民怀着十分兴奋的心情，热烈地欢迎和接待了阿富汗王国首相萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德和随同他前来的贵宾们，并对达乌德首相带来的阿富汗人民对我国人民的友谊和进一步加强我们两国友好关系的真诚愿望，表示由衷的感谢。
    达乌德首相在北京停留期间，拜会了毛泽东主席和我国其他领导人，并同我国周恩来总理举行了友好的会谈。两国总理发表的联合公报中，再次确认他们今年1月22日在喀布尔发表的联合公报的内容，重申进一步加强两国友好联系的愿望和决心。他们还就两国共同关心的问题交换了意见，并且讨论了目前的国际形势。在注意到两国各自的国家制度和国际政策的特点下，表示了他们维护世界和平的共同愿望。我们两国领导人的密切接触，无疑将使我们两国的传统友谊在新的基础上得到更广泛的发展，也将对亚非地区和世界的和平友好事业产生有利的影响。
    中国和阿富汗两国人民都是热爱自由、独立与和平的人民。我们两国不但是亲近的邻邦，在历史上有过悠久的经济和文化的联系，而且在近代遭受帝国主义压迫的命运，在争取各自民族独立自由所走过的道路，有许多地方也是相类似的。阿富汗人民为了维护自己的民族独立和反对帝国主义的侵略，曾经进行了长期的英勇斗争，博得了一切爱好自由的人民的同情和尊敬。阿富汗现在所坚持奉行的和平中立和同一切国家发展友好关系的政策，对于缓和国际紧张局势，促进各国之间的了解和信任，正在发挥着日益重要的作用。中国人民同阿富汗人民一样，坚决维护自己国家的独立，捍卫和平，珍视同一切国家人民之间的友好关系。我国政府在对外政策方面所奉行的基本政策就是和平政策。中国人民愿意同一切国家在和平共处五项原则的基础上友好合作。正是由于我们两国之间存在着这许多共同的特点和愿望，我们两国的友好关系是巩固的，并且能够在互相交往中得到不断的发展。
    两国总理在联合公报中，重申他们对于亚非会议最后公报中所阐述的各项原则的信念，同时希望按照联合国宪章的原则增强亚非国家以及世界其他部分的团结精神，并认为原子能只应该应用于和平目的以造福人类。这再一次表达了中阿两国人民对于维护亚非地区和世界的和平，加强各国之间的友好合作和反对帝国主义侵略的坚定决心。
    自从万隆会议以来，亚非国家的团结有了很大的加强，亚非地区维护民族独立和反对帝国主义侵略的斗争，有了极大的发展。特别是在中东地区，阿拉伯国家人民为了保卫民族独立与和平，同西方殖民主义展开了英勇的斗争，使殖民主义遭受了重大的打击。但是，殖民主义侵略亚非国家的阴谋是决不会自动放弃的，它们现在正在继续制造中东地区的紧张局势。美国正唆使土耳其军队集结于叙利亚边境，并不断制造挑衅事件，企图伺机向叙利亚燃起侵略的战火。这严重地威胁了叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家的和平和安全。美国正采取分裂阿拉伯国家团结和分裂阿拉伯国家同其他亚非国家团结的办法，来达到它在中东推行“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略政策、攫取中东国家石油财富的野心。中国人民坚定地相信，只要阿拉伯国家和所有其他亚非国家在万隆会议所规定的各项原则基础上加强自己的团结，支持叙利亚和阿拉伯国家人民的正义斗争，美国在中东地区的侵略企图同样将遭到可耻的失败。
    达乌德首相和随同他的阿富汗贵宾们，昨天已经离开北京到我国各地参观访问了。我们衷心地祝福贵宾们身体健康和精神愉快，并衷心地祝贺中阿两国的友谊日益发展。
