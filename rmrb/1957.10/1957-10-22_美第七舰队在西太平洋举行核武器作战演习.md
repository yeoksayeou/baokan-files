Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: The US Seventh Fleet is currently conducting large-scale war exercises in the Western Pacific. US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, is participating in the exercise. Burke hurriedly traveled to the Far East to engage in activities after the Soviet Union successfully launched its first artificial satellite. He is trying his best to eliminate the influence of this Soviet achievement and exaggerate the US’s "nuclear navy" and "atomic missile power."

On the first day of the exercise (October 19), the Seventh Fleet dispatched an aircraft to drop a dummy “nuclear weapon.” On the second day, an anti-submarine exercise was held. Tomorrow, a reinforced battalion of the Marine Corps will conduct a helicopter-airborne assault on Okinawa, which will be the climax of the entire exercise.

    美第七舰队在西太平洋举行核武器作战演习
    新华社21日讯　美国第七舰队这几天正在西太平洋举行大规模的战争演习。美国海军作战参谋长伯克参加了这次演习。伯克是在苏联成功地发射了第一颗人造卫星之后匆忙赶到远东来活动的，他竭力想消除苏联这一成就的影响，并且夸张美国的“核海军”和“原子导弹力量”。
    第七舰队在演习的第一天（10月19日）派出一架飞机投掷了一颗假的“核武器”。第二天举行了反潜艇演习。明天将举行海军陆战队的一个加强营对冲绳岛展开直升飞机—伞兵袭击的演习，这将是整个演习的最高潮。
