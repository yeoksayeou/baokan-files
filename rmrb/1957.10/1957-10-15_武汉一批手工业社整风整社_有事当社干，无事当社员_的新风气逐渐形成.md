Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric Dispatch - In Wuhan, the first batch of one hundred and seventeen handicraft cooperatives to carry out the rectification campaign are mostly in the stage of airing opinions, and at the same time accepting members' opinions to improve their work. Some cooperatives have seen a climax of airing opinions.

In the past month or so, these handicraft cooperatives have organized members to air their views in various forms such as forums, big-character posters, and individual conversations. The opinions raised by the members involve many aspects such as the work style of cadres, production and financial management, and welfare, including some problems that have not been resolved for a long time since the establishment of the cooperatives. According to the spirit of correcting while rectifying, the leaders at all levels of the handicraft system have carefully studied these opinions and immediately solved those that are correct and can be solved immediately.

Since the beginning of airing opinions, the work style of the cadres of these cooperatives has been significantly improved. They have begun to change the shortcomings of not going deep into the masses in the past, and participate in actual labor with the masses. Some cooperative directors have also stipulated that they should spend a certain amount of time participating in labor every day. The atmosphere of "cadres handle matters, members work when needed" is gradually forming among the cooperative cadres.

The cooperatives are beginning to solve the problems in production management that members have raised more opinions about. In the past, the Jinxing Machinery Cooperative often delayed delivery due to chaotic production, and some orders were even delayed for more than a year. After the members criticized this shortcoming in the airing of opinions, the cooperative immediately mobilized the masses to find the reasons and formulate improvement measures and systems. Recently, the cooperative has accepted orders for stoves and screws from state-owned commercial departments, and none of them have been delayed.

The leading departments at the municipal and district levels of the Wuhan Handicraft System have also accepted the correct criticisms from the members and initially solved the problems related to the management and transformation of individual handicrafts. The phenomenon of members requesting to withdraw from the cooperatives and the illegal activities of individual handicraft households have therefore been greatly reduced.

In the course of the great airing and great contending, the members also raised some fundamental questions, such as "Is cooperation good or individual work good?" and "What kind of business methods should the cooperative adopt?" The cooperatives plan to solve these problems through a great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism.

### 武汉一批手工业社整风整社  “有事当社干，无事当社员”的新风气逐渐形成

　　武汉一批手工业社整风整社
    “有事当社干，无事当社员”的新风气逐渐形成
    据新华社武汉电　武汉市第一批开展整风整社运动的一百十七个手工业合作社，大部分正处在鸣放阶段，同时接受社员意见改进工作，有些社已出现鸣放高潮。
    这些手工业社，近一个多月来，采用座谈会、大字报、个别交谈等多种形式，组织社员鸣放，社员们提出的意见涉及到干部工作作风、生产和财务管理、生活福利等许多方面，其中包括一些建社以来长期没有解决的问题。根据边整边改的精神，手工业系统的各级领导认真研究了这些意见，对于正确而又可以马上解决的，便立即解决。
    在开始鸣放以来，这些合作社的干部的作风有比较显著的改进。他们开始改变过去不大深入群众的缺点，同群众一起参加实际劳动，有的社主任还规定自己每天要抽出多少时间来参加劳动。“有事当社干，无事当社员”的风气，正在社干部中逐渐形成。
    对于社员意见比较多的生产管理上的问题，各社正开始着手解决。金星机器社过去由于生产混乱，交货期常常延误，有的订货甚至拖延一年多才交。社员们在鸣放中对这个缺点提出批评后，社里便立即发动群众找原因，订出改进的办法和制度。最近这个社接受国营商业部门的烤火炉、螺丝等订货，都没有误期。
    武汉市手工业系统市、区两级的领导部门也接受社员正确的批评，初步解决了有关个体手工业的管理与改造方面的问题，社员要求退社的现象与个体手工业户的违法行为都因此大大减少。
    在大鸣大放中，社员们也提出了一些带有根本性的问题，如“合作化好还是单干好”，“合作社应该采取什么样的经营方式”等。对这些问题，各社准备通过社会主义与资本主义两条道路的大辩论来解决。
