Five Rivers Discovers Prehistoric Giant Elephant Fossils

    Workers at the water control construction site in Hao City, Five Rivers County (ancient Gaixia), discovered prehistoric giant elephant fossils dating back 400,000 to 500,000 years in the alluvial layer 3.5 meters below the surface in the sand and gravel layer.

    The unearthed elephant tusk fossils are shaped like tree trunks, extremely smooth, dark in color on the outside, white inside, and the bone patterns are clearly visible. One of the elephant tusk fossils was broken at the root, but the well-preserved part is still 2.95 meters long, with a diameter of 20 centimeters at the end. Another elephant tusk fossil is about 2 meters long. In addition, two huge elephant molar fossils were also unearthed.

    五河发现史前巨象化石
    五河县濠城镇（古垓下）治淮工地的民工，在深入地平面三点五公尺的砂缸层下面冲积层中，发掘到史前时期四、五十万年前的巨象化石。
    出土的象牙化石形如树干，光滑无比，外表墨色，内部白色，骨纹清晰可数。其中一个象牙化石根部破碎，但保留完好的部分还有二点九五公尺长，末端粗度为直径二十公分。另一个象牙化石，约有二公尺长。此外还挖到巨大的象臼齿化石两块。
