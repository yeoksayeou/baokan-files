People's Daily Commentator: Heighten Vigilance, Continue the Struggle

    Thanks to the efforts of peace-loving countries, the United Nations General Assembly resumed debate on the "Complaint of Threats to the Security of Syria and International Peace" on the 25th. People hope that through this debate, the United Nations can take effective measures in a timely manner to remove the threat of aggression against Syria, so as to safeguard peace in the Middle East and the world. However, the United States is extremely uneasy about Syria's complaint. It is trying every means to continue disrupting the debate on this complaint, so that its plot to invade Syria can be realized.

    Not long ago, the United States used the King of Saudi Arabia's "mediation" between Turkey and Syria as an excuse to delay the debate in the United Nations General Assembly. Recently, according to Western news agencies, the United States is encouraging Canada and six other countries to prepare a proposal for Hammarskjöld to "mediate" the Syrian-Turkish relations. However, everyone knows that there is no dispute between Turkey and Syria in the first place, so there is no such thing as "mediation." The whole problem now is clearly this: the military activities of the United States and Turkey seriously threaten the peace and security of Syria, and Syria demands the removal of this threat. Turkey is carrying out military provocations against Syria, while Syria is suffering from the threat of aggression. How can these be equated? The purpose of the United States is very clear: it wants to put Turkey and Syria in the same position for "mediation," while it pretends to be an outsider. It attempts to distort the truth of the Middle East situation in this way, conceal the role played by the United States in the conspiracy to invade Syria, and completely remove Syria's complaint from the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.

    In order to achieve these goals, the United States once again made irresponsible remarks and wantonly slandered the Soviet Union in the United Nations General Assembly. The US representative Lodge vowed that the current threat of Turkey to Syria does not seem to exist, it is just a "phantom" "created" by the Soviet Union (!) However, slander can never cover up the undeniable facts. Recently, according to various reports, the Turkish troops gathered on the Syrian-Turkish border have increased to 100,000. Turkish troops have repeatedly crossed the Syrian border to carry out provocative activities. Turkish planes continue to violate Syrian airspace. The Turkish navy, army, and air force are holding joint large-scale exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean and southeastern Turkey. Are these all mirages in the desert? As for the military activities of the United States in Turkey, they are even more obvious. Western news agencies have repeatedly reported that a large number of American officers have appeared in the Turkish troops on the Syrian-Turkish border, and American planes are parked at airports in southern Turkey. The US Sixth Fleet continues to concentrate on the Turkish coast. The United States has announced that it will hold military exercises with Britain, Turkey and other countries on the southwest coast of Turkey at the end of October. In order to encourage Turkey to invade Syria, the joint statement of the US-British talks on October 25 used the name of the North Atlantic Treaty to intimidate Syria. Harkins, commander of the Southeast European ground forces of the North Atlantic aggression group, even publicly bragged for Turkey, saying, "The Turks can defeat them (referring to the Syrian people) without much effort." A strong atmosphere of gunpowder has permeated around Syria. No one who cares about peace can ignore these facts. It is absolutely impossible for the like of Lodge to cover up the aggressive conspiracy of the United States and Turkey and shirk their responsibilities.

    The Soviet Union has made significant efforts to defend peace in the Middle East. In his letter to the United Nations General Assembly on the 16th, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko put forward the request that the member states of the United Nations "immediately come forward to intervene in order to prevent the occurrence and expansion of war" and supported the suggestion to immediately establish a special committee of the United Nations to carefully investigate the Syrian-Turkish border situation. The TASS authorized statement on the 18th also put forward the proposition that "no more threats of force should be taken against the Middle East and Near East countries, and no interference should be made in the internal affairs of these countries," and demanded that the United States take joint action with the Soviet Union in accordance with this principle. However, the United States has been afraid to debate these fundamental principles of maintaining peace in the Middle East in the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, this further proves that the reason why the United States wants to wantonly slander the Soviet Union is just to find an excuse to continue its aggressive activities.

    Under such circumstances, peace in the Middle East and the security of Syria are still at a critical juncture. Syria remains highly vigilant, preparing for any eventuality, while insisting that the United Nations discuss Syria's complaint. This is absolutely necessary. All peace-loving countries and people must more actively support the struggle of the Syrian people and demand that the United Nations be able to assume its responsibilities and immediately stop the United States from igniting a new war in the Middle East.

    本报评论员：提高警惕，继续斗争
    由于爱好和平国家的努力，联合国大会在25日恢复了关于“对威胁叙利亚安全和国际和平控诉案”的辩论。人们都希望，经过这一辩论，联合国能够及时地采取有效措施，解除对叙利亚的侵略威胁，以维护中东和世界的和平。但是，美国却对叙利亚的控诉案感到极端不安。它正在想尽办法继续破坏关于这个控诉案的辩论，以便使它的侵略叙利亚的阴谋能够实现。
    不久以前，美国曾利用沙特国王在土耳其和叙利亚之间进行“调解”作为借口，来拖延联合国大会的辩论。最近，据西方通讯社报道，美国正在怂恿加拿大等七国准备提出由哈马舍尔德“调解”叙、土关系的提案。但是，谁都知道，在土耳其和叙利亚之间本来并没有什么争端，因此根本不存在什么“调解”的问题。现在的全部问题明明是：美国和土耳其的军事活动严重地威胁着叙利亚的和平安全，叙利亚要求解除这种威胁。土耳其是向叙利亚进行军事挑衅的，而叙利亚则是遭受侵略威胁的，这怎么能够等量齐观呢？美国的目的是很清楚的，它想把土耳其和叙利亚放在同样的地位上来进行“调解”，而它自己则仿佛成了局外人。它企图用这种办法来歪曲中东局势的真相，掩饰美国在侵略叙利亚的阴谋中所扮演的角色，并把叙利亚的控诉案从联合国大会的议程上根本抹掉。
    为了达到这些目的，美国又在联合国大会上信口雌黄，肆意诽谤苏联。美国代表洛奇信誓旦旦地说，目前土耳其对叙利亚的威胁似乎并不存在，它只是苏联“制造”的“假象”（！）但是，诽谤决不能掩盖千真万确的事实。最近，据各方报道，土耳其集结在叙、土边界的部队已经增达十万人。土耳其部队连续越过叙利亚边境进行挑衅活动。土耳其飞机不断侵犯叙利亚的领空。土耳其的海陆空军正在东地中海和土耳其东南部举行联合大演习。难道这些都是沙漠里的海市蜃楼吗？至于美国在土耳其的军事活动，也是更加明显了。西方通讯社不断报道，在土叙边境的土耳其部队里出现了大批美国军官，在土耳其南部的机场上停放着美国飞机。美国第六舰队继续向土耳其海岸集中。美国已宣布，它将于10月底同英国和土耳其等国在土耳其西南海岸举行军事演习。为了鼓励土耳其侵略叙利亚，10月25日发表的美英会谈联合声明用了北大西洋公约的名义来恫吓叙利亚。北大西洋侵略集团东南欧地面部队司令哈金斯最近甚至公开替土耳其吹嘘说：“土耳其人能不用多大力气就打败他们（指叙利亚人民）。”在叙利亚的周围已经弥漫着一股强烈的火药气氛。任何一个关心和平的人都不可能无视于这些事实。洛奇之流想要掩盖美国和土耳其的侵略阴谋，推卸它们的责任，这是绝对不可能的。
    为了保卫中东和平，苏联已经作了重大的努力。苏联外长葛罗米柯在16日致联合国大会的信中，提出了联合国会员国“立刻出面干预，以便防止发生和扩大战争”的要求，并且支持立刻成立联合国专门委员会来仔细调查叙、土边境局势的建议。18日塔斯社受权发表的声明中也提出了“必须不再对中近东国家采取武力威胁、不干涉这些国家的内政”的主张，并要求美国本着这一原则和苏联采取共同行动。但是，美国在联合国大会上一直不敢就这些维护中东和平的根本原则进行辩论。因此，这就更加证明了，美国所以要肆意诽谤苏联，不过是为了寻找借口，以便继续进行它的侵略活动而已。
    在这种情况下，中东和平和叙利亚的安全仍然处于紧急关头。叙利亚一边保持高度警惕，准备应付万一，一边坚持要求联合国讨论叙利亚的控诉案。这是完全必要的。一切爱好和平的国家和人民必须更积极地支持叙利亚人民的斗争，并要求联合国能够担负起它的责任，立即制止美国在中东挑起新的战火。
