Xinhua News Agency, 7th: TASS reports: Scientific stations, astronomers, and radio enthusiasts are observing the artificial satellite for the third day and night. As of 6:00 AM (Moscow time) on October 7th, the artificial satellite had orbited the Earth approximately thirty-two full times. During this time, it traveled 1.4 million kilometers.

Messages sent from radio enthusiasts and astronomers to "Moscow - Satellite" are increasing daily. Radio observations of the satellite indicate that the power of the radio station on the satellite can guarantee that ordinary radios can reliably receive signals at a frequency of 20 megacycles at any time, day or night. Sensitive radios can receive satellite signals for as long as thirty to forty minutes, maintaining contact with the satellite over distances of eight to nine thousand kilometers.

It can now be said that the data obtained by scientific stations, astronomers, and radio enthusiasts is of great scientific value. Measuring the satellite's operational parameters allows us to accurately calculate the basic elements of the satellite's orbit and predict its operation for many days and nights to come. Based on measurements taken over two days and nights, the satellite's orbital period has hardly changed.

The weather is unfavorable in areas within the Soviet Union where optical stations are located, with cloudy skies making it difficult to observe the satellite. However, the Uzhgorod and Leningrad optical stations both sighted the satellite at sunrise on October 6th and successfully measured its coordinates. The artificial satellite's equipment is functioning normally. At 6:00 AM on October 7th, the satellite was located along the Antarctic coast, then flew northeast across the Pacific Ocean, crossed Florida, and passed over New York at 6:36 AM. Sixteen minutes later, it flew over Moscow.

Observation of the artificial satellite will continue.

    苏联人造卫星运行正常
    已绕地球三十多圈　平安讯号不断传来
    据新华社7日讯　据塔斯社讯：科学站、天文学家和无线电爱好者对人造卫星的观察已经进入第三昼夜。截至10月7日晨六时（莫斯科时间）为止，人造卫星已绕地球运行了约三十二整周。在这段时间内，它运行了一百四十万公里。
    无线电爱好者和天文学家发给“莫斯科——卫星”的消息日益增多。对卫星的无线电观察表明，卫星上无线电台的功率可以保证普通收音机在白天和夜间任何时间用二十兆周的频率有把握地收到。灵敏的收音机收到卫星讯号的持续时间可达三十—四十分钟，在八—九千公里的距离内同卫星保持联系。
    现在已经可以说，科学站、天文学家和无线电爱好者所获得的资料具有很大的科学价值。测量卫星运行参数可以使我们准确地算出卫星轨道的基本要素，算出卫星今后许多昼夜内的运行情况。根据两昼夜内的测量数据，卫星运转的周期几乎没有变化。
    在苏联境内设有光学站的地区天气不好，天空有云，很难观察到卫星。不过，乌日哥罗德和列宁格勒光学站在10月6日日出时都看到了卫星，并且成功地测量了它的座标。人造卫星设备的工作是正常的。10月7日晨六时卫星位于南极沿岸，然后经过太平洋往东北方向飞去，越过佛罗里达，于六点三十六分在纽约上空掠过。十六分钟以后，它就飞过了莫斯科上空。
    对人造卫星的观察将继续进行。
