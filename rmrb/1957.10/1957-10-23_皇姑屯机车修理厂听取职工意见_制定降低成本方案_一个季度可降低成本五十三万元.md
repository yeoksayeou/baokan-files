The Huang Gutun Locomotive and Passenger Car Repair Factory announced an important cost reduction reform plan on the 10th of this month. This plan will be implemented from the fourth quarter, striving to reach the advanced level of the lowest cost nationwide by the end of the year, reducing cost expenses by 530,000 yuan.

This reform plan was proposed based on the exposure of wasteful phenomena by employees during the "Blooming and Contending" period and after inspection and research by the professional improvement team. Since the "Great Blooming and Great Contending" movement in September, the factory's employees have raised many opinions about high costs and significant waste. Based on the principle of rectification while correcting, the factory's Party committee formed an inspection team and sent people to the Harbin Factory and Mudanjiang Factory, which have the lowest machine and passenger car costs nationwide, to learn from them. They discovered that their factory's costs were indeed higher than those of other fraternal factories. For example, the cost of overhauling a hard-seat passenger car at their factory was 14,000 yuan, while at the Harbin factory it was only 7,700 yuan. The cost of overhauling a locomotive at their factory was more than 29,000 yuan, while at the Mudanjiang factory it was only more than 22,000 yuan. After understanding the materials and returning to the factory, they conducted a thorough and detailed inspection and discovered many long-standing waste problems that had not been resolved.

For example, the asbestos bricks used for insulation in locomotive boilers should have been removed intact and reused after the repair was completed. However, in the past, this factory broke and threw away most of the asbestos bricks. According to statistics, since 1954, this relatively unimportant raw material alone has wasted 321,000 yuan. Based on the problems discovered during the inspection and referring to the experience of the Harbin and Mudanjiang factories, the inspection team made specific improvement suggestions while inspecting. As of the 10th, a total of 194 suggestions for eliminating waste have been put forward for both locomotives and passenger cars, and improvements have begun. For example, regarding the problem of painting the outer skin of passenger cars, the past due to the unsuitable painting tools, each car required 90 kilograms of paint. After studying at the Harbin factory, they found that they only used 27 kilograms of lead paint per car. After returning to the factory, they proposed suggestions to improve the painting tools and save paint, and it has now been initially reduced to 35 kilograms per car.

    皇姑屯机车修理厂听取职工意见
    制定降低成本方案
    一个季度可降低成本五十三万元
    本报讯　皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂于本月10日宣布了一个降低成本的重要改革方案。这个方案从第四季度实行，争取在年末达到全国最低成本的先进水平，降低成本费五十三万元。
    这个改革方案是根据职工在鸣放中对浪费现象的揭发，并经专业改进组的检查研究后提出的。从9月份大鸣大放以来，这个厂的职工对成本高、浪费大提出不少意见。工厂党委根据边整边改的方针，组成检查组，并派人分赴全国机、客车成本最低的哈尔滨工厂和牡丹江工厂学习。发现自己厂的成本确实比各兄弟工厂都高。如中修一台硬席客车，该厂是一万四千元，而哈尔滨厂只七千七百元。大修一台机车，该厂是二万九千多元，而牡丹江厂仅二万二千多元。根据了解材料回厂后又进行了深入细致的检查，发现了很多长期以来没有解决的浪费问题。
    如机车锅炉保温用的石绵砖，本来应当完整的拆下来，待修完车后再用上去。而这个工厂过去却把大部分石绵砖拆坏了扔出去。据统计，从1954年以来，仅这一项不太重要的原材料就浪费三十二万一千元。检查组根据检查中发现的问题，参照哈尔滨和牡丹江两厂的经验，一边检查，一边提出具体改进意见。到10日为止，在机车、客车两方面共提出杜绝浪费的建议一百九十四条，现已开始改进。如客车外皮喷油漆问题，过去由于喷油工具不合适，每台车要用九十公斤油漆，到哈尔滨工厂学习后，发现人家每台车只用二十七公斤铅油，回厂后提出了改进喷油工具、节约油漆的建议，现已初步减少到每台车三十五公斤。
