    Great Victory of Proletarian Internationalism
    —Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution
    Yao Zhen Wang Li
      The Chinese revolution is a continuation of the great October Revolution, and the Chinese revolutionary cause is a part of the world proletarian revolutionary cause. In their long revolutionary struggle, the Chinese Communists have resolutely followed the principles of Marxism-Leninism and upheld the banner of internationalism, following the example of the Soviet Communists. Comrade Mao Zedong has always believed that the revolution in China against imperialism, that is, against the international bourgeoisie and international capitalism, does not belong to the category of the old world bourgeois democratic revolution, but to a new category; it is not part of the old bourgeois and capitalist world revolution, but a part of the new world proletarian socialist revolution that began with the October Revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong has always believed that China cannot achieve independence without the assistance of socialist countries. Rejecting Soviet aid would lead to the failure of the revolution. If we abandon alliance with the Soviet Union and ally with the imperialists, we should abolish the word "revolution" and transform it into reactionary nationalism, into capitulationism to imperialism, into counter-revolution. Chinese history proves that people's attitude towards the Soviet Union, whether to unite or oppose, is the dividing line between revolution and reaction. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The cause of liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people can only be truly assisted by socialist countries... and our cause cannot achieve final victory without their assistance."
    When China, after the victory of the revolution, appeared on the international stage as a socialist power, the Chinese Communists, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, explicitly announced the policy of "leaning to one side," declared China's participation in the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, declared the complete equality of all nations in the world, promoted peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems, resolutely opposed imperialism and the colonial system, and were willing to unite with all forces advocating peace in the world to strive for a favorable peaceful international environment for our country's socialist construction. The Chinese Communists continuously conducted ideological education combining internationalism and patriotism among the whole Party and the people of the whole country, and resolutely criticized the erroneous ideas of bourgeois nationalism. The Chinese Communist Party repeatedly warned its members and the people of the whole country that internationalism must be the criterion for our actions in the international communist movement. Our Party has pointed out many times that the main means by which imperialists and reactionaries in various countries undermine proletarian international solidarity is to use the narrow national sentiments and certain national estrangements among the people of various countries. Therefore, all conscious working classes and sincere revolutionaries must always pay attention to using the weapon of proletarian internationalism to oppose bourgeois nationalism.
    Bourgeois nationalism is a manifestation of the bourgeois world outlook. The bourgeoisie treats national issues and decides on policies for handling national issues from the nature of pursuing profits and from the narrow self-interest of the bourgeoisie. However, in the current international situation, we should decide our attitude towards various types of nationalism that play different roles from the common interests of opposing the imperialist aggressive bloc. We firmly oppose imperialist national aggressionism and national capitulationism, which advocates uniting with imperialism against the Soviet Union. However, we should support and assist revolutionary nationalism that advocates uniting with the Soviet Union and opposing imperialist aggression. Neutral nationalism, if it appears in the capitalist world, also plays an important role in maintaining peace, opposing colonialism, and opposing imperialist wars of aggression; therefore, we should also sympathize with and support it. However, even progressive nationalism is not a position that our socialist countries and communists should take. Since nationalism is a manifestation of a bourgeois world outlook, its progressive role cannot exceed the scope of the bourgeois democratic revolution at best. If we attempt to use neutralist nationalism in our socialist countries, it can only play a negative and harmful role, and cannot have any positive and beneficial effect.
      In the previous period, bourgeois right-wingers in our country vigorously spread reactionary nationalist fallacies, and gained resonance among some bourgeois elements and upper-level intellectuals, as well as other aspects. This fact seriously tells us that although the internationalist and patriotic consciousness of the people of our country has greatly improved since the national liberation, this does not mean that the ideological remnants of bourgeois nationalism have been completely eliminated, and that the instigation of the right-wingers has no effect at all. Until now, some people with blurred understanding, especially those intellectuals who are deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology, are still easily misled by the right-wingers. This is because nationalism is a stubborn ideology left over from the old society, and it has profound social and historical roots, so it will not disappear immediately with the changes in the social base. This kind of bourgeois reactionary thought has even had a lasting influence within the proletariat, and it is not easy to eliminate. In today's historical conditions, if we do not pay attention to prevention and criticism, these ideological remnants left over from the old society are still entirely possible to reappear in new forms, thus forming great-power chauvinism or narrow nationalism in the minds of some people. These are incompatible with the interests of proletarian international solidarity, incompatible with the fundamental interests of the socialist cause, and also incompatible with the fundamental interests of the people of our country.
    When spreading reactionary nationalist toxins, bourgeois right-wingers often boast that their主張(zhǔzhāng) are "patriotism," and that they themselves are "patriots." However, people know that reactionary nationalism has nothing in common with patriotism. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "Pure patriotism respects the equality of other nations, and at the same time hopes that the excellent ideals of the world's humanity will be realized in its own country, and advocates the love and unity of the people of all countries. As for reactionary bourgeois nationalism, it incites mutual hostility and hatred among the people of various countries." Therefore, we must resolutely oppose this reactionary bourgeois nationalism. We believe that the true patriotism and internationalism of the masses of people in all countries are combined with each other, and true patriotism is to love one's own motherland and people, to love the excellent culture and revolutionary traditions of one's own nation, to hope that one's own people will be completely liberated from all national oppression and class oppression, and to hope that the most beautiful ideals of mankind—socialism and communism—will be realized in one's own country. In order to achieve these lofty goals, true patriots should never incite mutual hostility among the people of various countries, especially should not oppose the Soviet Union; but should respect other nations, promote the unity of the people of various countries, and jointly struggle with the Soviet Union and all nations that treat us equally. Patriotism and internationalism are consistent, and only by combining the two can the most fundamental interests of the people of all countries be realized. If we talk about patriotism without internationalism, we can only fall into the quagmire of bourgeois narrow nationalism.
    In their reactionary nationalist clamor, the bourgeois right-wingers in our country focused on opposing our policy of "leaning to one side" towards the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, opposing our country's participation in the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, and advocating the so-called neutral "middle road." It is very clear that this 주장(zhǔzhāng) that does not distinguish between socialism and imperialism and does not distinguish between enemies and friends is only a kind of argument welcomed by imperialism. We believe that the opposition between imperialism and the forces of the people of the world is the most fundamental characteristic of the current international struggle. In order to form a camp to oppose the imperialist aggressive forces attacking the people, socialist countries must unite and form an unbreakable camp in order to unite other forces opposing imperialist aggression and finally defeat the imperialist aggressive forces. This is a very clear principle. We should strive for all true friends, but we must first unite ourselves, we must distinguish between enemies and ourselves, and we cannot regard enemies as friends, and then we can talk about striving for friends and defeating enemies. The bourgeois right-wingers oppose the division of camps, but in reality, it is only in order to disintegrate the socialist camp. Because monopoly capitalism is international, the imperialist camp always objectively exists. The "middle road" advocated by the right-wingers is actually what the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries advocated, and this is only in order to destroy the unity of the socialist countries and make the anti-imperialist united front of the world collapse, and facilitate the aggressive forces headed by US imperialism to carry out its war conspiracy. As a result, it will seriously harm our socialist cause and the cause of defending world peace, and even endanger the people of our country and the people of the world to suffer the scourge of war. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly criticize and resolutely oppose this kind of nationalist thought that advocates neutralism in our socialist country.
    We believe that only "leaning to one side" is the only correct foreign policy. This policy is not only conducive to opposing imperialism and international war forces, but also conducive to our unity with Asian and African national independent countries. People know that it is precisely because of the existence of a strong socialist camp that it has facilitated the development of the national independence movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and it has made it possible for neutralism to exist and develop in the capitalist world. According to the principles of proletarian internationalism, the proletariat of all socialist countries that have already won victory should do everything possible to support the revolutionary movement of the international proletariat, including the national liberation movement of the broad masses of people in colonial and semi-colonial countries. Our friendly cooperation with them is in line with each other's interests. The unity between socialist countries and nationalist countries is based on anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism; while the unity between socialist countries is not only to jointly oppose imperialism and colonialism, but also to unite with socialism as a common goal. We must have unity between socialist countries in order to better unite various nationalist countries. We cannot imagine that socialist countries are not united, and can unite various nationalist countries. This also shows that strengthening the unity of the socialist camp not only does not exclude the unity with other nationalist countries, but on the contrary, it will facilitate the development of this cooperative relationship.
    For the Chinese people, the most important symbol of internationalism is to unswervingly strengthen and consolidate the unity of the socialist countries, especially to strengthen and consolidate the unity and alliance between China and the Soviet Union.
    The close unity and friendly cooperation between the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is the most reliable guarantee for defending the socialist cause and consolidating world peace. In order to oppose imperialist aggression and for the benefit of the cause of the people of the world, it is necessary to continuously strengthen and consolidate the unity and cooperation between socialist countries. Because the socialist countries have eliminated the roots of oppression and exploitation, there have never been, are not now, and will never be fundamental contradictions and conflicts of interest between each other. This new type of international relationship has set a brilliant example for mankind. In order to properly handle the relevant issues between socialist countries, the Soviet government's declaration on the basis for developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries issued on October 30 last year, and the statement issued by our government on November 1 supporting the Soviet Union's declaration, both emphasized strengthening the unity of socialist countries on the basis of proletarian internationalism and complete equality, respect for territorial integrity, national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. In the past year, socialist countries have further developed and consolidated their mutual relations in accordance with these principles, and are continuing to work hard to constantly consolidate and strengthen the friendly cooperation of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. The facts are very clear: any problem in the mutual relations of socialist countries can be solved smoothly through sincere consultation and comradely discussion on the basis of unity. The unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union cannot be destroyed by any force.
      The Chinese Communists have always believed that in the socialist family, we must shoulder and be good at fulfilling our internationalist responsibilities. For the sake of our common cause, we need the support and assistance of fraternal countries, and at the same time, we should do our best to support and help fraternal countries. We believe that the existence and development of each fraternal country is the most valuable assistance to us; and we should also do our own work well, so that China's socialist cause will continue to develop, as a support for the cause of other fraternal countries and the people of the world; at the same time, we should also spare no effort to fulfill our internationalist responsibilities when other fraternal countries need it. We have always attached importance to the leading role of the great Soviet Union in our socialist family, and we are proud to have such a great brother as the Soviet Union.
    People know that the reason why the Soviet Union has become the center of socialist countries and the international communist movement is precisely the greatest historical achievement of the October Revolution. Socialist countries and international communist forces must have a center in order to strengthen their unity and oppose imperialism. The Soviet Union is the first socialist country, and it is the first to move to the stage of transition to communism in the ranks of socialist countries. Its experience is the richest and its national strength is the strongest; the people of the world look at the Soviet Union with anticipation, and the imperialist aggressors look at the Soviet Union with fear. Therefore, it is only natural that the Soviet Union is the center of socialist countries and international communist forces. All socialist countries and communist parties in various countries can create something in their own struggles to enrich the experience of the international communist movement and make significant contributions to the international communist movement. However, we believe that the Soviet experience is the most complete. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: The historical experience of the Soviet Communist Party is a complete model, and there is only this one complete model in the world. The basic experience of the Soviet Union, which is what we usually call the path of the October Revolution, is precisely the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. Abandoning these basic experiences is abandoning Marxism-Leninism. In the past revolutionary struggle, the Chinese Communists correctly learned from the Soviet experience, and in the future socialist construction, we must continue to correctly learn from the Soviet experience. Therefore, any idea that we can do without a center or without the Soviet Union as the center is detrimental to the international communist cause and is incorrect.
    The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have always believed that the unity of China and the Soviet Union is not only related to the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries, but also related to the international revolutionary cause and the common interests of the people of the world. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "This friendship, which includes one-third of the world's population, is the most reliable guarantee for the inevitable victory of the world's cause of peace and progress." The unity of China and the Soviet Union is an important part of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The unity of China and the Soviet Union plays an important role in the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and it also plays an important role in the unity of the people of the world. Because of this, Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly pointed out: The unity of China and the Soviet Union "will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and affect the victory of world peace and justice." The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have always regarded efforts to consolidate and continuously strengthen the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union as our most important internationalist responsibility.
    The imperialist aggressive forces are always妄想(wàngxiǎng) to provoke and destroy the united and friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. However, the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union, armed with the great principles of proletarian internationalism, cannot be destroyed by any provocation of the imperialist aggressive forces. Even Dulles, the spokesman of the imperialist aggressive forces, could not help but admit that "the Russian and Chinese Communists are linked together by close ideological ties" (speech in San Francisco on June 28). Every provocation and destruction by the imperialist reactionaries only reminds us to defend the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union, and to defend the fraternal unity of the socialist countries as if we were protecting our own lives. The great people of China and the Soviet Union will always be the closest brothers and the most reliable comrades-in-arms. In the lofty cause of strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, maintaining world peace, and promoting human progress, the Chinese people will always stand firmly with the Soviet people. The friendship between the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, is "permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it."
    Let us always unite together! Always unite with the Soviet Union, always unite with the socialist countries, always unite with the working classes of various countries and the people of the world! The glory of the October Revolution shines on us, and the victorious banner of proletarian internationalism flutters in front of us. We will surely be able to overcome all difficulties, realize our great ideals, and achieve the great victory of the communist cause. (To be continued)

    无产阶级国际主义的伟大胜利
    ——庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年
    姚溱　王力
      中国革命是伟大十月革命的继续，中国革命事业是全世界无产阶级革命事业的一部分。中国共产党人，在自己长期的革命斗争中，也是坚决地遵循马克思列宁主义的原则，以苏联共产党人的榜样，坚持着国际主义的旗帜。毛泽东同志一向认为，在中国发生的反对帝国主义，即反对国际资产阶级、反对国际资本主义的革命，它不是属于旧的世界资产阶级民主革命的范畴，而是属于新的范畴；它不是旧的资产阶级和资本主义的世界革命的一部分，而是新的、十月革命所开始的世界无产阶级社会主义革命的一部分。毛泽东同志一向认为，中国要独立，不能离开社会主义国家的援助。拒绝苏联的援助，革命就要失败。如果舍联俄而联帝，那就要把“革命”两字取消，变成为反动的民族主义，变成为向帝国主义的投降主义，变成为反革命。中国历史证明，人们对待苏联的态度，联合还是反对，就是革命与反动的分界线。毛泽东同志说：“中华民族和中国人民的解放事业，只有社会主义的国家，……才能真正援助；而我们的事业，没有他们的援助是不能取得最后胜利的。”
    当中国革命胜利以后，中国已经成为一个社会主义大国出现在国际舞台上的时候，中国共产党人，以毛泽东同志为代表，就明确地宣布了“一边倒”的政策，宣布中国参加以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，宣布世界上一切民族完全平等，宣传不同制度的国家和平共处，坚决反对帝国主义和殖民制度，并且愿意和全世界一切主张和平的力量团结起来，为我国建设社会主义的事业争取一个有利的和平国际环境。中国共产党人在全党和全国人民中不断地进行国际主义与爱国主义相结合的思想教育，坚决地批判资产阶级民族主义的错误思想。中国共产党再三告诫自己的党员和全国人民，必须以国际主义作为我们在国际共产主义运动中的行动的准则。我们的党多次指出：帝国主义者和各国反动派破坏无产阶级国际团结的主要手段，就是利用各国人民中的狭隘的民族感情和某些民族隔阂。因此，一切觉悟的工人阶级和真诚革命的人们，必须经常注意用无产阶级国际主义的武器来反对资产阶级民族主义。
    资产阶级的民族主义是资产阶级世界观的一种表现。资产阶级是从追求利润的天性出发，从资产阶级狭隘的私利出发，来对待民族问题和决定处理民族问题的政策。但是，在目前的国际条件下，我们对待各种不同作用的民族主义，应当从反对帝国主义侵略集团的共同利益出发，来决定我们应有的态度。对于帝国主义的民族侵略主义，以及主张联合帝国主义反对苏联的民族投降主义，我们是坚决反对的。但是，对于那些主张联合苏联、反对帝国主义侵略的革命的民族主义，则是我们应该赞助和支持的。主张中立的民族主义，如果在资本主义世界中出现，对于维护和平、反对殖民主义和反对帝国主义侵略战争也是有重要作用的；因此，这也是我们应当同情和支持的。但是，即使是带有进步性的民族主义，也不是我们社会主义国家和共产主义者所应当采取的立场。民族主义既然是一种资产阶级世界观的表现，它的进步作用充其量也不可能超过资产阶级民主革命的范畴。如果企图把中立主义的民族主义用于我们社会主义国家，那就只能起消极的、有害的作用，而不可能有任何积极的、有益的作用。
      前一时期，我国资产阶级右派分子曾经大肆散播反动的民族主义谬论，并且在一部分资产阶级分子和上层知识分子以及其他方面获得了共鸣。这个事实严重地告诉我们，虽然全国解放以后，我国人民的国际主义和爱国主义的觉悟有了很大的提高；但是，这并不等于说，资产阶级民族主义的思想残余已经完全清除了，右派分子的煽动已经丝毫不起作用了。直到现在为止，有一些认识模糊的人，特别是那些受资产阶级思想影响较深的知识分子，还是容易受右派分子的迷惑的。这是因为，民族主义是旧社会遗留下来的一种顽固的思想，它有着深远的社会历史根源，因此不会随着社会基础的变化而立即消逝。这种资产阶级反动思想，甚至在无产阶级内部也发生了长久的影响，并不是很容易清除的。在今天的历史条件下，如果我们不注意防止和批判，这些旧社会遗留下来的思想残余还完全有可能以新的形式重新出现，从而在某些人的思想中形成大国沙文主义或狭隘的民族主义。这些都是同无产阶级国际团结的利益不相容的，同社会主义事业的根本利益不相容的，也是同我国人民的根本利益不相容的。
    资产阶级右派分子在散播反动的民族主义毒素时，常常吹嘘他们的主张是“爱国主义”，而他们自己则是“爱国主义者”。但是，人们知道，反动的民族主义是同爱国主义毫无共同之点的。刘少奇同志说过：“纯正的爱国主义尊重其他民族平等，同时希望世界人类优秀的理想在自己国内实现，主张各国人民的亲爱团结。至于反动的资产阶级的民族主义，则煽惑各国人民的互相敌视与仇恨”。因此，我们必须坚决反对这种反动的资产阶级的民族主义。我们认为，各国人民大众的真正的爱国主义和国际主义是互相结合的，真正的爱国主义就是热爱自己的祖国和人民，热爱自己民族的优秀文化和革命传统，就是希望自己的人民从一切民族压迫和阶级压迫下获得彻底解放，希望人类最美好的理想——社会主义和共产主义在自己的国家里得到实现。为了达到这些崇高的目的，真正的爱国主义者绝对不应该煽动各国人民之间的相互敌视，特别不应该反对苏联；而应该尊重其他民族，促进各国人民的团结，联合苏联和一切以平等待我之民族共同奋斗。爱国主义和国际主义是一致的，只有把两者结合起来，才能实现各国人民最根本的利益。如果脱离了国际主义而谈什么爱国主义，那就只能陷入资产阶级的狭隘民族主义的泥坑中去。
    我国资产阶级右派分子在其反动的民族主义的叫嚣中，集中反对我们对于苏联和社会主义阵营实行“一边倒”的政策，反对我国参加以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，主张实行所谓中立的“中间路线”。非常清楚，这种不区别社会主义和帝国主义，不分敌我的主张，只是为帝国主义所欢迎的一种论调。我们认为：帝国主义同全世界人民力量的对立，是当前国际斗争中最基本的特点。为了反对帝国主义侵略势力结成一个阵营向人民进攻，社会主义各国必须团结一致，结成牢不可破的阵营，才能团结其他反对帝国主义侵略的力量，最后战胜帝国主义侵略势力。这是非常清楚的道理。对于一切真正的朋友，我们都是应当争取的，但是必须首先团结自己，必须分清敌我，而不可以认敌为友，然后才能谈到争取朋友，战胜敌人。资产阶级右派分子反对划分阵营，实际上不过是为了瓦解社会主义阵营。因为，垄断资本主义是国际性的，帝国主义阵营总是客观存在着的。右派分子所主张的“中间路线”，实际上也就是匈牙利反革命分子所主张过的，这只是为了破坏社会主义各国的团结，并且使全世界的反帝统一战线陷于瓦解，而便利于美帝国主义为首的侵略势力进行它的战争阴谋。其结果，势必严重地危害我们的社会主义事业和保卫世界和平的事业，甚至有使我国人民和世界人民遭受战争浩劫的危险。因此，对于这种在我们社会主义国家中提倡中立主义的民族主义思想，是必须严格批判和坚决反对的。
    我们认为，只有“一边倒”才是唯一正确的对外政策，这个政策不仅有利于反对帝国主义和国际战争势力，而且也有利于我们对于亚非民族独立国家的团结。人们知道，正是因为有了强大的社会主义阵营的存在，这才便利了殖民地半殖民地国家民族独立运动的发展，这才使中立主义在资本主义世界中有存在和发展的可能。根据无产阶级国际主义的原则，一切社会主义业已胜利的国家的无产阶级，应当尽一切可能去支援国际无产阶级的革命运动，包括殖民地半殖民地国家里广大人民的民族解放运动在内，我们和他们的友好合作，是符合彼此的利益的。社会主义国家和民族主义国家的团结是在反帝国主义、反殖民主义基础上的团结；而社会主义国家之间的团结，不但是共同反对帝国主义和殖民主义，而且是以社会主义为共同目标的团结。我们必须有了社会主义国家之间的团结，才可能更好地团结各个民族主义国家。我们不能设想社会主义国家不团结，而能团结各个民族主义国家。这也说明了，加强社会主义阵营的团结，不但不排斥和其他民族主义国家的团结，相反的，这将更便利于发展这种合作关系。
    对于中国人民来说，国际主义的最重要的标志，就是要始终不渝地加强和巩固社会主义各国的团结，特别是加强和巩固中苏两国的团结和联盟。
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家之间的亲密团结和友好合作是保卫社会主义事业和巩固世界和平最可靠的保证。为了反对帝国主义的侵略和全世界人民事业的利益，必须不断地加强和巩固社会主义国家之间的团结和合作。由于社会主义各国都已经消灭了产生压迫和剥削的根源，所以相互之间的关系过去没有、现在没有、将来也永远不会有根本的矛盾和利害冲突。这种新型的国际关系为人类树立了光辉的楷模。为了正确地处理社会主义各国之间的有关问题，去年10月30日苏联政府发表的关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言以及11月1日我国政府发表的支持苏联这个宣言的声明，都强调了在无产阶级国际主义和完全平等、尊重领土完整、国家独立和主权、互不干涉内政的基础上，加强社会主义国家的团结。一年以来，社会主义各国按照这些原则进一步发展和巩固了相互的关系，并且正在继续为着不断地巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的友好合作而努力。事实非常清楚：社会主义各国在相互关系上的任何问题，都是完全可以在团结的基础上经过真诚的协商和同志式的讨论求得顺利解决的，以苏联为首的各个社会主义国家的团结是任何力量所不能破坏的。
      中国共产党人一向认为，在社会主义的大家庭中，必须担负起并善于尽到自己的国际主义的责任。为了我们的共同事业，我们需要兄弟国家的支持和帮助，同时我们也应尽力支持和帮助兄弟国家。我们认为，每一个兄弟国家的存在和发展，都是对我们的最宝贵的援助；而我们也应当做好自己的工作，使得中国的社会主义事业不断发展，以此作为对于其他兄弟国家和世界人民事业的一种支持；同时，我们还应当在其他兄弟国家需要的时候，毫不吝惜地克尽我们的国际主义责任。我们一贯地重视伟大的苏联在我们社会主义大家庭中的首要作用，并且以我们有苏联这样一个伟大的兄长感到光荣。
    人们知道，苏联所以成为社会主义各国以及国际共产主义运动的中心，正是十月革命最伟大的历史成果。社会主义各国和国际共产主义力量为了加强自己的团结，为了反对帝国主义，就一定要有一个中心。苏联是第一个社会主义国家，在社会主义国家的行列中最先走到向共产主义过渡的发展阶段，它的经验最丰富，国力最强大；全世界的人民用期待的眼光望着苏联，帝国主义侵略者用恐惧的眼光望着苏联，所以，在社会主义各国和国际共产主义力量中以苏联为中心，是理所当然的。所有的社会主义国家和各国共产主义政党都可以在自己的斗争中有所创造，来丰富国际共产主义运动的经验，对于国际共产主义运动作出重大的贡献。但是，我们认为，苏联的经验是最完备的。毛泽东同志早就指出：苏联共产党的历史经验，是一个完全的典型，在全世界只有这一个完全的典型。而苏联的基本经验，也就是我们平常所说的十月革命的道路，正是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。不学习这些基本经验，就是抛弃马克思列宁主义。中国共产党人在过去革命斗争中，正确地学习了苏联的经验，在今后社会主义建设事业中，还必须正确地学习苏联的经验。因此，任何认为可以不要中心或者可以不以苏联为中心的想法，都是不利于国际共产主义事业的，都是不正确的。
    中国共产党和中国人民一向认为，中苏两国的团结一致，不仅关系到两国人民的根本利益，同时也关系到国际革命事业和全世界人民的共同利益。毛泽东同志说过，“这个包括全世界三分之一人口的友谊，是世界和平进步事业必然胜利的最可靠的保证。”中苏两国的团结是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的重要组成部分，中苏两国的团结一致，对于以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结一致，具有重要的作用，对于全世界人民的团结一致，也有重要的作用。正因为如此，毛泽东同志曾经一再指出：中苏两国的团结，“不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”中国共产党和中国人民一直把努力巩固和不断加强中苏两国的友好合作，作为我们最重要的国际主义责任。
    帝国主义侵略势力总是在妄想挑拨和破坏中苏两国之间的团结友好关系。但是，被伟大的无产阶级国际主义原则武装起来的中苏友好团结，是帝国主义侵略势力的任何挑拨所无法破坏的。甚至帝国主义侵略势力的发言人杜勒斯也不能不承认“俄国和中国共产党人是由紧密的思想联系连结在一起的”（6月28日在旧金山讲话）。帝国主义反动派每一次的挑拨和破坏，都只是提醒了我们，要像保护自己生命一般地捍卫中苏两国的友好团结，捍卫社会主义各国的兄弟团结。伟大的中苏两国人民永远是最亲密的兄弟和最可靠的战友，在加强社会主义阵营的团结、维护世界和平和促进人类进步的崇高事业中，中国人民永远同苏联人民坚决地站在一起。中苏八亿人民的友谊，正如毛泽东同志所说的是“永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的”。
    让我们永远团结在一起！永远同苏联团结在一起，永远同社会主义各国团结在一起，永远同各国工人阶级和全世界人民团结在一起！十月革命的光辉照耀着我们，无产阶级国际主义的胜利旗帜在我们前面飘扬，我们一定能够克服一切的困难，实现我们的伟大理想，取得共产主义事业的伟大胜利。（续完）
