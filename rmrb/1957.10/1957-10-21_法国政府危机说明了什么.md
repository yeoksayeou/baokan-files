What Does the French Government Crisis Show?
Wang Kun

After being appointed to form a cabinet, 比内 (Binei) of the French "Independent Party," failed when he requested approval from the National Assembly after several days of intense activity. Before him, 摩勒 (Mole) of the Socialist Party and 普利文 (Puliven) of the Democratic Socialist Resistance Alliance both tried to form a cabinet but retreated knowing it was difficult. The French government crisis, which has lasted for more than half a month, is still continuing.

The current French government crisis began with the fall of the 布歇—莫努里 (Buxie-Monuri) government at the end of last month. The fall was caused by the parliament's rejection of the Algerian "Fundamental Law" proposed by the government. This "Fundamental Law," under the guise of granting Algeria "autonomy," was essentially aimed at maintaining French colonial rule in Algeria. However, even such a deceptive "reform" plan caused unease among the conservatives. Under pressure from conservative members of parliament, 布歇—莫努里 (Buxie-Monuri) made "important revisions" to the draft when he submitted the "Fundamental Law" to parliament for discussion on September 17. It clearly stipulated that Algeria was "an inseparable part" of France, and postponed the establishment of central administrative and legislative institutions in Algeria until eighteen months after the local parliamentary elections, while also adding "special electoral law clauses" to ensure the "true representation" of local Europeans in the local parliamentary elections. Even so, conservative members of parliament still voted against the Fundamental Law when it was finally put to a vote in parliament. As a result, the 布歇—莫努里 (Buxie-Monuri) government collapsed because it could not muster enough support in parliament.

The fundamental reason for the current French government crisis is the disastrous failure of the Algerian colonial war policy, and the accompanying severe financial and economic crisis.

The Algerian war has been fought for almost three full years. Over the past three years, the flames of the Algerian people's struggle have become increasingly fierce. At the end of 1954, there were only three thousand armed guerrillas in Algeria; currently, a "National Liberation Army" with 134,000 people has emerged in Algeria. The number of French invading troops in Algeria has increased from more than 40,000 at the beginning to one million (accounting for more than three-quarters of the total French troops), but they are still struggling to cope. After 布歇—莫努里 (Buxie-Monuri) came to power, he further strengthened the military suppression policy in Algeria, expanded the focus of military deployment to the borders between Algeria and Tunisia and Morocco, and used special military equipment such as helicopters supplied by the United States to "encircle and suppress" the guerrillas in the mountains. As a result, many young French soldiers lost their lives. The Algerian National Liberation Army has continued to achieve new victories, and they have equipped themselves with a large number of weapons seized from the French army. At the same time, due to the further deterioration of relations between France and Tunisia and Morocco, France's situation in the entire North Africa has become increasingly difficult.

The Algerian war has also brought huge disasters to the French economy. According to a bulletin published by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in September, France spends 700 billion francs on the Algerian war every year. At the same time, the colonial war has stimulated the rapid expansion of military production. The share of military production in French industrial production is increasing. Currently, French military orders account for more than 20% of industrial manufactured goods. The state's orders for military industries have increased from 740 billion francs in 1954 to more than one trillion francs currently. A report from the French National Economic Audit Committee pointed out that in 1956, French public consumption (mainly military consumption) increased by 30%, while personal consumption increased by only 5%. The abnormal development of military production has disrupted the balance of the economy, weakened the competitiveness of the French economy, and caused huge fiscal deficits and serious inflation.

The adverse consequences of the militarization of the national economy are particularly prominent in France's foreign trade. The aforementioned report pointed out that France is currently unable to balance its trade balance by exporting products from its own machinery manufacturing and electrical industries. The military and political organs consume such goods, worth 300 billion francs in 1955, 430 billion in 1956, and are expected to reach 535.5 billion this year. At the same time, the total value of foreign trade exports has decreased sharply, decreasing by 36% in 1956 compared to the previous year. This year, France's foreign trade deficit, according to the Paris "Perspective" weekly, will reach 500 billion francs. Currently, France has become the largest debtor in the European Payments Union.

In order to reduce France's increasing foreign trade deficit and prevent the exhaustion of foreign exchange, the 布歇—莫努里 (Buxie-Monuri) government announced a decree on foreign payment reform in August, devaluing the franc by 20% in disguise.

This measure also failed to "save" France's foreign exchange crisis. According to the "Echo," many exporters are unwilling to convert the foreign exchange they receive from selling goods into the unstable franc. At the same time, restrictions on imports have led to a reduction in the supply of raw materials and a continued rise in prices.

In this situation, the 布歇—莫努里 (Buxie-Monuri) government took a series of emergency measures. One of them was to reduce agricultural subsidies and lower the basic price of wheat by 6%, with the aim of encouraging farmers to grow less wheat and raise more livestock for meat exports. However, the result was a soaring price of wheat and meat. This situation was not only opposed by the people, but also aroused the dissatisfaction of agricultural capitalists. The government also attempted to freeze wages under the guise of "freezing prices," and adjusted the items used to calculate the price index for this purpose, reducing the proportion of essential consumer goods for workers in the index.

In addition, taxes have also increased significantly. The new tax revenue collected this year amounts to 150 billion francs. This has made French taxes swallow up 43% of the national income. These policies of 布歇—莫努里 (Buxie-Monuri) government, which tightened the people's belts, aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the broad masses of the people. Parisian commentators pointed out when talking about the fall of the cabinet this time that even if 布歇—莫努里 (Buxie-Monuri) escaped the "Fundamental Law" hurdle, he would inevitably fail when the parliament discussed economic policies.

The Algerian issue and the economic difficulties caused by it are the fundamental reasons for the fall of 布歇—莫努里 (Buxie-Monuri), and also two difficult problems facing the successors of 布歇—莫努里 (Buxie-Monuri). Currently, the French ruling group is arguing endlessly because it is trapped in a dilemma. The difficulty in producing a new prime minister and the prolonged government crisis show how exhausted the French ruling group has become.

What will be the way out for the French political situation? There is only one way out. That is to establish a government relying on left-wing forces as pointed out by the French Communist Party, and peacefully resolve the Algerian issue on the premise of recognizing Algerian national independence. This is not only in the interests of the Algerian nation, but also in the interests of France itself.

    法国政府危机说明了什么
    王堃
    法国“独立党”的比内，在受命组阁以后，经过几天的紧张活动，在提请国民议会要求批准时失败了。在他以前，社会党的摩勒和民主社会抵抗联盟的普利文先后尝试组阁，结果都知难而退。已经延续了半个多月的法国政府危机仍然在继续着。
    法国的这一次政府危机是由布歇—莫努里政府在上月底倒台开始的。倒台是由于议会否决了政府提出的阿尔及利亚“根本法”引起的。这个“根本法”打着给阿尔及利亚“自治”的幌子，实质上是为了维护法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治。但是，这样一种欺骗性的“改革”方案也引起了保守派的不安。在保守派议员的压力下，布歇—莫努里在9月17日把“根本法”提交议会讨论时又对草案作了“重要修改”，明确规定了阿尔及利亚是法国的“一个不可分割的部分”，并且把建立阿尔及利亚中央行政机构和中央立法机构的问题推迟到地方议会选举后十八个月再行考虑，同时增加了在地方议会选举中要保证当地欧洲人的“真正代表权”的“特殊选举法条款”。纵然如此，保守派议员在议会最后对根本法进行表决的时候还是投了反对票。于是，布歇—莫努里政府就因为在议会中凑不起足够的支持票而垮台了。
    法国这次政府危机产生的根本原因，是阿尔及利亚殖民战争政策的惨败，以及伴之而来的严重的财政与经济的危机。
    阿尔及利亚战争已经打了差不多整整三年。三年来，阿尔及利亚人民斗争的火焰愈来愈炽烈。1954年末，阿尔及利亚只有三千名武装的游击队员；目前，在阿尔及利亚已经出现了一支拥有十三万四千人的“民族解放军”。在阿尔及利亚的法国侵略军的数目由开始时的四万多人增加到目前的一百万人（占法国全部兵力四分之三以上），但仍穷于应付。布歇—莫努里上台后，进一步加强了对阿尔及利亚的军事镇压政策，将军事的部署重点措施扩大到阿尔及利亚同突尼斯、摩洛哥的边境，同时使用美国供应的直升飞机等特种军备来“兜剿”山区的游击队。结果，法国许多青年士兵断送了生命。阿尔及利亚民族解放军不断取得了新的胜利，他们用从法国军队缴获的大批武器装备了自己。同时，由于法国同突尼斯、摩洛哥关系的进一步恶化，法国在整个北非的处境也益形困窘。
    阿尔及利亚战争还给法国的经济带来了巨大的灾难。据联合国欧洲经济委员会在9月份发表的公报，法国在阿尔及利亚战争中每年要花费七千亿法郎。同时，殖民战争刺激着军备生产的急剧扩张。法国工业生产中的军事生产份额愈来愈增大。目前法国的军事订货相当于工业制成品的20％以上。国家对军事工业的订货由1954年的七千四百亿法郎增至目前的一万多亿法郎。法国国家经济审计委员会报告书指出，1956年法国公共消费（主要是军事消费）增加了30％，个人消费只增加5％。军事生产的畸形发展破坏了经济的平衡，削弱了法国经济的竞争力量并造成巨大的财政赤字和严重的通货膨胀。
    国民经济军事化的恶果特别突出地反映在法国对外贸易上。上述报告书指出，法国目前已经不能用出口本国机器制造业和电气工业的产品来平衡贸易收支了。军政机关耗费的这一类货物，1955年值三千亿法郎，1956年增加到四千三百亿，今年预计为五千三百五十亿。同时，对外贸易的输出总值急剧下降，1956年比前一年降低了36％。今年法国对外贸易赤字，据巴黎“展望”周刊估计，将达五千亿法郎。目前，法国已成为欧洲支付同盟中的最大债户了。
    为了减缩法国日益增加的对外贸易逆差和阻止外汇的涸竭，布歇—莫努里政府曾在8月间公布了对外支付改革法令，把法郎变相贬值20％。
    这一措施也并未能“拯救”法国外汇的危机。据“回声报”透露，许多出口商都不愿意把自己出卖货物得到的外汇来变成不稳定的法郎。同时对进口的限制措施又引起生产原料的供应减少和物价的继续上涨。
    在这种情况下，布歇—莫努里政府采取了一系列紧急措施。其中之一是降低农业补贴并把小麦基本价格压低6％，这样做的目的是使农民少种些小麦而多养牲畜以供肉类输出。但是结果却使小麦肉类等价格飞涨。这种情况不但受到人民的反对，且招致农业资本家的不满。政府还企图用“冻结价格”作幌子来冻结工资，并且为此调整了计算物价指数的项目，使劳动人员的主要消费品在指数中的比重减低。
    此外，赋税也大大增加了。今年征收的新税额达一千五百亿法郎。这使法国的赋税吞没了国民收入的43％。布歇—莫努里政府这些勒紧人民裤带的政策，引起了广大人民的普遍不满。巴黎的评论家在谈到这次内阁垮台的事情时就指出，即使布歇—莫努里逃过了“根本法”这一关，在议会讨论经济政策的时候也免不了要失败。
    阿尔及利亚问题和因而引起的经济困难，是布歇—莫努里倒台的根本原因，也是摆在布歇—莫努里的继承者面前的两个难题。目前，法国统治集团由于陷于窘境而争吵不休。新总理难于产生和政府危机长期延续，说明了法国统治集团已到了如何山穷水尽的地步。
    法国政局的出路将是什么呢？出路，只有一条。那就是法国共产党所指出的建立一个依靠左派力量的政府，在承认阿尔及利亚民族独立的前提下和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。这不仅符合阿尔及利亚的民族利益，也符合法国本身的利益。
