Xinhua News Agency, 17th: A.B. Aristov, head of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation, gave a speech to four thousand students when he visited Peking University this morning, encouraging them to study hard and achieve better results.

Aristov said: The Soviet people and Soviet youth believe that science can only reach its peak under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government. The Soviet Union now far surpasses the United States in some areas of science and in the number of specialized talents. But we are not satisfied with this. We must surpass the United States and other advanced countries in science and culture. All Soviet people are studying, young people are studying, and are unanimously concerned with the most advanced technologies, to master these technologies, to master the latest achievements in all aspects of science and technology. No imperialist country can give the people the opportunity to be widely educated, to mobilize the people to master science and technology. Because imperialism is profit-seeking and parasitic, while the people's government requires the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural life and the prosperity of science and culture. Aristov said that they were very happy to see so many primary schools in China, and to see students studying in such a good environment at Peking University. He wished the students good academic results and a happy life.

Aristov also spoke about the great friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China. He said that the people of the Soviet Union and China are brothers, and we have the same history and common goals. This common goal is communism. Aristov added that Soviet-Chinese friendship is unbreakable, and both the Soviet Union and China are strong. United together, no force can stop us from moving towards a communist society.

Head of Delegation Aristov's speech was warmly welcomed by the students.

Members of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation also accompanied Head of Delegation Aristov to Peking University. The distinguished guests were accompanied by President Ma Yinchu and Vice-President Jiang Longji on a tour of the campus.

　　阿里斯托夫勉励北京大学学生
    掌握科学技术最新的成就
    新华社17日讯　苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长阿·鲍·阿里斯托夫今天上午参观北京大学的时候，向四千名学生发表讲演，勉励他们努力学习，取得更好的成绩。
    阿里斯托夫说：苏联人民和苏联青年都相信，只有在共产党和人民政权的领导下，科学才能达到高峰。苏联在科学的一些领域和专门人材的数量上现在都远远超过了美国。但是我们并不以此为满足，我们还要在科学文化方面超过美国，超过其他先进的国家。全体苏联人民都在学习，青年们都在学习，一致在关心最先进的技术，来掌握这些技术，掌握科学技术各方面最新的成就。没有任何帝国主义国家能够给人民以广泛受教育的机会，动员人民起来掌握科学技术。因为帝国主义是追求利润的、寄生性的，而人民政府所要求的是人民物质文化生活的不断提高，科学文化的繁荣。阿里斯托夫表示他们很高兴能在中国看到许多小学，在北京大学又看到学生们在这样良好的环境里学习，他祝学生们取得良好的学习成绩和生活幸福。
    阿里斯托夫还谈到苏中两国人民的伟大友谊；他说，苏中两国人民是亲兄弟，我们有着同样的历史和共同的奋斗目标。这个共同的目标就是共产主义。阿里斯托夫又说，苏中友谊是牢不可破的，苏中两国都是强大的。我们团结在一起，就没有任何力量能够阻止我们走向共产主义社会。
    阿里斯托夫团长的讲话受到了学生们的热烈欢迎。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表团的团员们也随同阿里斯托夫团长来到了北京大学。贵宾们由马寅初校长和副校长江隆基陪同在校内进行了参观。
