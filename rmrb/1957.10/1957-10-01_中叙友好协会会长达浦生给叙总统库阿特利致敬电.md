    To His Excellency Shukri al-Kuwatli, Esteemed President, and to the Syrian brothers and sisters!
    Today, we gather in Beijing to establish the China-Syria Friendship Association, and we extend our highest respects to Your Excellency the President and to the entire Syrian people.
    The establishment of the China-Syria Friendship Association demonstrates the desire of our people to further develop the friendship between the people of China and Syria. We hope that the friendly relations between China and Syria will be strengthened and consolidated day by day.
    The subversive activities and armed intervention conspiracies carried out by the American aggressor bloc in Syria have aroused universal anger among the Chinese people and the people of the world. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with and firmly support the just struggle of the Syrian people to safeguard sovereignty and Afro-Asian peace.
    May the friendship between the people of China and Syria further grow!
    May the Syrian people win the final victory in their just struggle against aggression!
                              President of the China-Syria Friendship Association, Da Punsheng
                                    September 30, 1957, in Beijing
