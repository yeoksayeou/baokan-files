Socialist Ideology Is Gripping the Broad Masses of Peasants
	A New Atmosphere in the Countryside After Great Debates
	Handing in Good Grain and Selling More Surplus Grain
	Liaoning Peasants' Patriotic Enthusiasm Soars
	(Our Dispatch) After the socialist great debate centered on the grain issue in the rural areas of Liaoning Province, the patriotic enthusiasm of the province's peasants soared, and unhealthy tendencies disappeared.

	Before the great debate, some individual farmers often flaunted to the commune members: "Individual farmers do not hand in public grain, do not sell surplus grain, have plenty to eat and wear, and have freedom of action. See who is superior!" For a time, this confused some commune members, and some commune members wanted to withdraw from the commune after the autumn harvest. During the great debate, the so-called "superiority" of individual farming was completely exposed. Many commune members reasoned with individual farmers face-to-face: "Not handing in public grain and not selling surplus grain are illegal acts. What kind of superiority is this?" "Having plenty to eat and wear and having freedom of action relies on speculation and profiteering. We don't envy that!" After this debate, those who originally wanted to withdraw from the commune did not withdraw, and more than half of the individual farmers in the province have applied to join the commune.

	After the exposure and criticism of the over-reporting of disaster situations and concealment of production last year in the great debate, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives increased their national concept and selected the best crops for single harvesting and threshing for paying public grain. Handing in good grain and selling surplus grain has become an important condition for rural areas to compete for patriotism. Wu Lianbi, director of the Xinxing Cooperative in Changtu County, had originally discussed with two accountants to distribute 500 jin of grain per person in the cooperative, record 400 jin, and ask the state to subsidize 100 jin per person. After the great debate, he took the initiative to make a self-criticism. The Hongguang Cooperative in Faku County originally planned to sell 600,000 jin of surplus grain, but after the great debate, it increased to 1.2 million jin.

	The socialist great debate has also promoted the current autumn harvest production movement. The labor attendance rate of various cooperatives has increased sharply during the autumn harvest, and many cooperatives have reached 100%. Many cooperatives have truly achieved "no stalks left, no grains left on the ears." Reducing grain losses in the autumn harvest alone can result in 200,000 to 300,000 tons more grain than last year.
	People Have Grain, Pigs Have Feed, and Granaries Have Reserves
	Significant Results in Conserving Grain in Sihe Township
	(Our Dispatch) In order to consolidate the results of socialist education on the grain issue, the Sihe Township Branch of the Communist Party of China in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, further and meticulously resolved various specific issues related to grain based on the ideological situation of the peasants, and encouraged the peasants' enthusiasm for developing production.

	After the great debate on the issue of unified purchase and sale of grain, the vast majority of peasants in Sihe Township believed that 440 jin of retained grain was enough to eat. However, due to the fact that some cadres and peasants did not understand the grain situation of the township and cooperative after the completion of the grain purchase task this year, some new ideological problems arose. Some peasants said that 440 jin of retained grain was only enough for people to eat, not for pigs, and they planned to reduce pig raising. Some cooperative cadres' departmentalism was also growing, and they concealed and lowered production with the commune members.

	Based on these new situations, the Sihe Township Branch of the Communist Party of China organized the peasants to discuss the issues of "Is there a contradiction between saving grain and developing pig raising?" and "Is it right to conceal production and deceive the state?" It also specifically organized peasants who were diligent and thrifty in managing their households, saving grain, developing pig raising, and living well to introduce their experiences, and induced peasants who were extravagant, wasted grain, did not raise pigs, and did not live well to consciously conduct self-examinations.

	Qiu Xiaoyu, a member of the Sanshan Cooperative with a family of three, averaged 599 jin of grain per person last year. They originally had enough rations for people and feed for pigs, but because they had no plan for using grain, they ate white rice three times a day after the corn was harvested, and used corn and beans in bowls to feed chickens and ducks. Not only did they not feed pigs, but they also lacked rations and borrowed more than 50 jin of grain from the state in the spring of this year. Another commune member, Zheng Dingcai, was not like this. His family of seven averaged 524 jin of grain per person last year, which was more than 70 jin less than Qiu Xiaoyu's family. However, because he had a plan for using grain, he still had 130 jin of old grain and more than 200 jin of grain distributed in the spring. His family's grain consumption plan was: eat three meals when busy with farming, two dry and one thin for those who work, and half dry and half thin for those who do not work; eat two meals when idle, and eat more porridge on rainy days when not working. All chicken and duck feed were made of bran, wheat bran, and sweet potato skins, saving grain as human rations. Not only did his family have enough grain to eat, but they also raised two big fat pigs. Under the sharp contrast of these two facts, the commune members all admitted that there was no contradiction between saving grain, developing pig raising, and storing grain. Yang Guoqing, an old upper-middle peasant who originally planned to sell pigs, also said that he would not sell pigs and planned to store 30 jin of grain, feed a meat pig, and a sow in this grain year. After further criticizing the right-leaning ideas of the cadres' departmentalism and tailism, Huayuan, Jianshan and other cooperatives reported more than 80,000 jin of concealed production.

	On this basis, the Party branch used accounting methods to help each peasant household formulate plans for diligence and thrift in managing their households, saving grain, developing pig raising, and doing a good job in production. Peasants throughout the township plan to increase the number of pigs by 596 by the end of this year, reaching an average of two and a half pigs per household. The idea of saving grain and preventing famine has also been widely established among the peasants. Of the 1,339 households in the township, 1,262 households have stored a total of 30,251 jin of grain for famine prevention, averaging more than 5 jin per person. Sanshan Cooperative, which stored more grain, averaged more than 6 jin per person.
	Jiangxi Peasants in Various Localities
	Actively Return State Loans
	(Our Dispatch) With the improvement of socialist consciousness, peasants in Jiangxi Province are actively returning their due loans to the state. As of the end of September, peasants throughout the province had returned more than 21.87 million yuan of various due loans, accounting for 35.27% of the bank's loan collection task for the second half of this year. Among them, Fuzhou Prefecture has returned 54.26%, Gannan District 38.27%; other prefectures have also reached 20%-30% respectively.

	Because all localities have strengthened ideological and political education and publicity on relevant agricultural loan policies in their loan collection work, coupled with this year's bumper agricultural production and increased income, commune members are full of joy when repaying their loans. For example, the vast majority of commune members in Linchuan County this year have actively returned their state loans after selling agricultural products. Nine of the twelve agricultural cooperatives in Shankou Township have fully repaid their loans; in addition to repaying all due loans of 4,600 yuan, the Minxi Agricultural Cooperative in Shantou Township also decided to over-fulfill the plan and repay 300 yuan of the basic construction loan for the Yi Hui Canal that was not yet due. Under the leadership of the cooperative's president and vice-president, the Jinlian Agricultural Cooperative in Longnan County sent more than 4,500 yuan of loans to the credit cooperative to the accompaniment of gongs and drums. In addition to repaying all public and private loans for the past two years, the cooperative also paid 170 yuan of 1957 government bonds.
	Gaodianzi Village, Ledu County
	Over-Fulfills Grain Purchase Task
	(Our Dispatch) After the socialist great debate centered on the grain issue in Gaodianzi Village, Ledu County, Qinghai Province, the grain purchase task for this year has been over-fulfilled. The village has handed in a total of 235,322 jin of purchase grain, exceeding the purchase task by 17.56%.

	After clarifying the major issues of right and wrong on the grain issue, the masses also discussed the issues of diligence and thrift in managing households and saving grain. After discussion, they formulated plans for saving grain. Commune member Ju Ji Kuan, based on the grain consumption situation last year, after careful calculation, sold another 181 jin of surplus grain. He said: Selling more surplus grain means the country has more strength for construction, and good socialist construction will make the peasants' lives better.

	After this great debate, unhealthy trends in rural areas declined, and righteousness rose. Commune members enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state according to the principle of "the state first, then the individual."

	October 2 was the happiest day for the commune members of Gaodian Cooperative. To celebrate the victory of the great debate, the commune members loaded the dried and cleaned grain onto carts early in the morning, beating gongs and drums, blowing trumpets, and holding colorful flags that read "Build the country diligently and thriftily, manage the household diligently and thriftily, sell more surplus grain to support national construction," and marched in a mighty manner to deliver all the public grain and surplus grain that should be handed over to the state warehouse. Now, the commune members are launching a new production upsurge, striving for a bumper harvest next year, and selling more surplus grain to support national construction.
	Harvesting Carefully and Completing Early - Heilongjiang Peasants Pay Attention to Maintaining Production
	Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th - The socialist great debate in Heilongjiang Province has promoted the work of increasing production and maintaining production in rural areas.

	In the past, Heilongjiang Province peasants did not care enough for grain, and the loss of grain last year alone was about one million tons. This year, the vast number of peasants who have been educated in the great debate have clarified the great significance of saving grain for building socialism, and improved the progress and quality of the autumn harvest. According to the calculation of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the harvest work in the province can be completed 10 to 20 days earlier than last year. This can avoid the phenomenon of grain being buried in the ground by snow as in previous years. Agricultural cooperatives in various localities not only try to improve the efficiency of harvesting in the autumn harvest, but also pay more attention to careful harvesting, careful collection, bundling while harvesting to avoid dropping ears and missing ears. Through the great debate, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have generally formulated covenants for protecting the autumn harvest, maintaining production, and saving grain. In Nenjiang Prefecture alone, more than 139,000 commune members in 1,320 agricultural cooperatives have signed patriotic production increase grain covenants. Some agricultural cooperatives have also formulated acceptance methods and organized children and women to go to the fields to pick up grain.

	For many years, the phenomenon of "livestock running wild and pigs and cattle everywhere" during the autumn harvest in Heilongjiang Province is rarely seen this year. According to the measures for saving grain put forward in the great debate, agricultural cooperatives have generally built fields and gardens, built field and garden walls, strengthened the management of scattered cattle, horses, young livestock, and poultry, and the cooperatives have also sent special personnel to the fields to protect the autumn harvest and guard the fields and gardens.
	Wenjiang Shiniu Agricultural Cooperative
	Caring for Public Property Becomes a Trend
	According to Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 16th - After the socialist great debate in the Shiniu Agricultural Cooperative, Qingping Township, Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, caring for public property has become a new trend.

	These days, the cooperative is engaged in the autumn harvest and autumn planting. Commune members are very careful when using agricultural tools. After use, they clean them and store them properly. The past practice of leaving agricultural tools such as drying mats, plows and harrows in the fields or drying yards overnight no longer exists. A few days ago, the commune members also cleaned up hundreds of large and small agricultural tools from rotten grass piles and pigsties. In this year's autumn harvest, although it has been cloudy for several days in a row, all the harvested grain is wet grain, but because the commune members are careful in storage, there have been no phenomena such as rotting and sprouting as in previous years.

	Due to the rapid development of production in the Shiniu Cooperative, which has been established for three years, it has accumulated tens of thousands of yuan of public property. Some commune members have gradually developed selfish and self-interested ideas of only trying to earn work points and not caring for public property. For example, the commune members in charge of water management and the commune members in charge of fertilization do not contact each other, and sometimes they do not care when they see the fertilizer that has just been applied being washed away by water. According to statistics, the plows that could have been used for more than ten years have been broken twenty or thirty in three years, and the lost agricultural tools are worth several hundred yuan. In the great debate held not long ago, many commune members criticized this behavior of not caring for public property. Some production teams specifically calculated the loss of property at the meeting. This made everyone realize the principle that the property of the cooperative is their own property.

　　社会主义思想正在掌握广大农民
    经过大辩论农村气象新
    交纳好粮多卖余粮
    辽宁农民爱国热情高涨
    本报讯　辽宁省农村经过以粮食问题为中心的社会主义大辩论后，全省农民爱国热情高涨，歪风邪气销声歛迹。
    在大辩论前，有些单干户经常向社员炫耀：“单干户不交公粮，不卖余粮，吃穿有余，行动自由，看看谁优越？”一时曾经迷惑了部分社员，有的社员想在秋后退社。大辩论中所谓单干的“优越”完全被揭穿了。不少社员同单干户当面讲理：“不交公粮、不卖余粮是违法行为，这算什么优越？”“吃穿有余，行动自由，靠的是投机倒把，我们不羡慕！”经过这场辩论原想退社的不退了，全省申请入社的单干户已占半数以上。
    在大辩论中揭露和批判了去年多报灾情、隐瞒产量以后，绝大部分农业社增加了国家观念，选出最好的庄稼单收单打，用来缴公粮。交好粮卖余粮已成了农村比爱国的重要条件。昌图县新兴社主任吴连壁，原已和两个会计商量好，全社每人分粮五百斤，按四百斤上账，叫国家再给每人补一百斤。大辩论后他主动作了检讨。法库县红光社，原来准备卖余粮六十万斤，大辩论后增加到一百二十万斤。
    社会主义的大辩论也推动了当前的秋收生产运动。秋收中各社的劳动出勤率激增，不少社达到了百分之百。不少社真正做到了“棵不剩穗，穗不存粒”。全省仅减少秋收中的粮食损失一项，就可比去年多收粮食二十万吨到三十万吨。
    人有粮猪有料仓有储
　　四合乡节约粮食效果显著
    本报讯　为了巩固粮食问题的社会主义教育成果，中共四川省内江县四合乡支部根据农民的思想情况，进一步深入、细致地解决有关粮食方面的各项具体问题，鼓励农民发展生产的积极性。
    四合乡农民经过粮食统购统销问题的大辩论后，绝大多数人认为留粮四百四十斤够吃，但是由于部分干部和农民对今年粮食统购任务完成后本乡、本社的粮食情况不摸底，又产生了一些新的思想问题。有的农民说，留粮四百四十斤，只有人吃的，没有猪吃的，准备少喂生猪；有的社干部本位主义思想又在滋长，与社员一起隐瞒压低产量。
    中共四合乡支部根据这些新情况，又组织农民讨论了“节约用粮与发展生猪有没有矛盾？”“隐瞒产量欺骗国家对不对？”的问题，并具体地组织勤俭持家，节约用粮，发展生猪，生活过得好的农民介绍经验，诱导因铺张浪费、糟蹋粮食、不喂生猪、生活过得不好的农民自觉地进行检查。
    三山社社员丘孝禹三口人，去年每人平均分粮五百九十九斤，本来是人有口粮猪有饲料，但是因为用粮没计划，谷子打下后，一天三顿白米饭，包谷、豆子成碗地拿来喂鸡鸭，不仅没有喂猪，口粮也欠缺，今年春天还向国家贷了五十多斤粮食。另一个社员郑定才却不是这样，他家七口人，去年每人平均分粮食五百二十四斤，比丘孝禹家还少七十多斤，但因他家用粮有计划，目前家中还有陈谷子一百三十斤，小春分的粮食二百多斤。他家的用粮计划是：农忙时吃三顿，做活路的人两干一稀，不做活路的人半干半稀，农闲时吃两顿，下雨天不出工就多吃稀的。喂鸡、鸭全用谷糠、麸皮、苕皮，节省粮食作为人的口粮。他家粮食不仅够吃，而且还喂了两口大肥猪、在这两个事实的鲜明对比下，社员们都承认：节约用粮，与发展生猪，储备粮食并无矛盾。原来准备卖猪的老上中农杨国清也表示不卖猪了，并计划在这个粮食年度内储备粮食三十斤，喂肉猪一口，母猪一口。花元、尖山等社经过进一步批判干部的本位主义、尾巴主义的右倾思想以后，自报隐瞒的产量八万余斤。
    在这个基础上，党支部又运用算账的办法，帮助每户农民制订了勤俭持家，节约用粮，发展生猪，搞好生产的计划。全乡农民计划在今年年底以前，再增加生猪五百九十六口，达到每户喂猪二口半。节约粮食，防备灾荒的思想在农民中也普遍树立，全乡一千三百三十九户，有一千二百六十二户储备了防荒的粮食共三万零二百五十一斤，每人平均五斤多，储粮较多的三山社每人平均六斤多。
    江西各地农民
    踊跃归还国家贷款
    本报讯　江西省农民随着社会主义觉悟的提高，纷纷将到期贷款归还国家。截至9月底止，全省农民已归还各种到期贷款二千一百八十七万余元，占今年下半年银行收贷任务的35.27％。其中抚州专区已归还54.26％，赣南区38.27％；其它专区也分别达到20％—30％不等。
    由于各地在收贷工作中，加强了思想政治教育和有关农贷政策的宣传，加上今年农业生产的丰收，收入增加了，社员们在还贷款的时候，都满怀愉快。如临川县今年绝大部分农业社的社员，在出售农产品后，都自动踊跃地归还国家贷款。该县山口乡十二个农业社，就有九个已全部还清了贷款；山头乡民溪农业社除还清全部到期贷款四千六百元外，并决定超计划归还未到期的宜惠渠基本建设贷款三百元。龙南县金莲农业社在该社正副社长的带领下，敲锣打鼓地将四千五百余元贷款送到信用社。全社除还清两年来的公私贷款外，还缴了1957年度公债款一百七十元。
    乐都县高店子村
    超额完成征购任务
    本报讯　青海省乐都县高店子村经过这次以粮食问题为中心的社会主义大辩论以后，今年征购粮任务已超额完成。全村共交征购粮二十三万五千三百二十二斤，超过征购任务的17.56％。
    在明辨了粮食问题上的大是大非以后，群众还讨论了勤俭持家、节约用粮的问题。经过讨论纷纷订出了节约用粮计划。社员巨积宽根据去年用粮情况，经过精打细算，又出卖了一百八十一斤余粮。他说：多卖一点余粮，国家就多一分建设力量，社会主义建设好，农民生活才会更好。
    经过这次大辩论后，农村邪气下降，正气抬头。社员根据“先国家后个人”的原则，热情地把多余的粮食卖给国家。
    10月2日，是高店社社员最欢乐的一天。为庆祝大辩论的胜利，社员们早早就把晒干拣净的粮食装上车，敲着锣鼓，吹着喇叭，打着“勤俭建国、勤俭持家，多卖余粮支援国家建设”的彩旗，浩浩荡荡，把应交售的公粮和余粮全部送到国家仓库。现在，社员们正在开展一个新的生产热潮，争取明年大丰收，多卖余粮支援国家建设。
    收割得细完成得早  黑龙江农民注意保收
    新华社哈尔滨16日电　黑龙江省的社会主义大辩论，推动了农村增产保收工作。
    黑龙江省农民过去对粮食爱护是不够的，仅去年损失的粮食就有百万吨左右。今年在大辩论中受到教育的广大农民，明确了节约粮食对建设社会主义的重大意义，提高了秋收中的进度和质量。据省农业厅的计算，全省收割工作可比去年提前十天到二十天完成。这样就可以避免像往年一样的粮食被雪埋在地里的现象。各地农业社在秋收中不仅想办法提高收割效率，更注意细割、细收、随割随捆，避免掉穗、丢穗。通过大辩论，全省各农业社普遍制定了护秋保收和节约粮食公约，单是嫩江专区就有一千三百二十个农业社中的十三万九千多户社员订了爱国增产粮食公约。有些农业社还制订了验收办法，并组织了儿童、妇女下地拣粮食。
    多少年来，黑龙江省秋收中的“牲畜大撒手，猪、牛遍地走”的现象，今年少见了。各农业社根据大辩论中提出的节约粮食的措施，普遍修建了场园，修起场园围墙，加强了对散牛散马幼畜和家禽的管理，各社还派专人到田间护秋和看守场园。
    温江石牛农业社
    爱护公共财产成风
    据新华社成都16日电　四川省温江县清平乡石牛农业社，经过社会主义大辩论以后，爱护公共财产已形成新的风气。
    这几天，这个社正在秋收秋种，社员们使用农具都十分爱护，用完之后，都弄干净，收放妥当，像过去那样把晒席、犁耙等农具丢在田里或晒坝上过夜的事已经没有了。前些日子，社员们还从烂草堆和猪圈里清理出上百件的大小农具。今年秋收中，虽然接连遇上阴天，收下的全是湿谷子，但由于社员们保管细心，没有像往年那样发生沤烂、生芽等现象。
    建社三年的石牛社，由于生产的迅速发展，已积累几万元的公共财产。部分社员渐渐滋长了只图赚工分，而对公共财产不爱护的自私自利思想。例如管放水的社员和管施肥的社员互不联系，有时眼看着刚施下的肥料被水冲走不管。据统计，本来可以用十多年的犁头，三年中就用坏二、三十件，损失的农具约值几百元。在不久前举行的大辩论中，许多社员对这种不爱护公共财产的行为提出批评。有的生产队在会上具体计算了财产损失账。使大家认识到社里的财产就是自己的财产的道理。
