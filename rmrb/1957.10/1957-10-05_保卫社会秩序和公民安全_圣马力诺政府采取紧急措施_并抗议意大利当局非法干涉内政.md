Xinhua News Agency report: The government of the Republic of San Marino is taking emergency measures to safeguard social order and citizen safety because the reactionary Christian Democratic Party launched a coup on October 1st, established a "provisional government," and declared the abolition of the legitimate government composed of Communists and Socialists.

This so-called "provisional government" was declared on October 1st by the San Marino Christian Democratic Party through a coup with the assistance of Italian Christian Democrats. The "government" has only four members and is currently located in an unfinished foundry on the San Marino border.

The Republic's government issued instructions on the 2nd to establish voluntary armed forces. The Minister of the Interior of the Republic, Domenico Morganti, said at a press conference that the voluntary armed forces would maintain public order and would be armed like San Marino's military forces. At the press conference, about one hundred young people swore an oath as the first batch of volunteers.

Currently, the democratically elected government of San Marino, composed of Communists and Socialists, still controls more than 90% of the territory of this thirty-eight square mile country.

The San Marino government also telegraphed the Italian government and the United Nations, pointing out that the "provisional government" is illegal and protesting the Italian government's interference in San Marino's internal affairs.

The Italian government imposed a complete blockade on San Marino on the 2nd, cutting off food supplies to San Marino in an attempt to put pressure on the Republic's government. The Italian Consul to San Marino, De Alessandrò, also attended a meeting of the illegal government of San Marino held on the Italian border under the protection of Italian troops, plotting to overthrow the Republic's government. At the same time, news has it that twenty Italian tanks and armored vehicles have been deployed to the San Marino border. The Italian government, under the pretext of protecting Italian nationals, is attempting to seize the opportunity to overthrow the country's democratic government.

Italian Communist and Socialist members of parliament questioned the government in parliament on the 2nd regarding the San Marino incident. They condemned the Italian government's interference in San Marino's internal affairs and opposed the recognition of the illegally established "provisional government" in San Marino.

According to Washington news: Following the Italian government, the United States announced on October 3rd its recognition of the reactionary so-called San Marino "provisional government." A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said that the United States had instructed its consulate in Florence to engage with this "government."

    保卫社会秩序和公民安全
    圣马力诺政府采取紧急措施
    并抗议意大利当局非法干涉内政
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：圣马力诺共和国政府正在采取紧急措施来保卫社会秩序和公民安全，因为反动的天主教民主党1日发动政变，并且成立了一个“临时政府”和宣布废除由共产党人和社会党人组成的合法政府。
    这个所谓“临时政府”是由圣马力诺天主教民主党人在意大利天主教民主党人援助下采取政变的方式在10月1日宣布成立的。这个“政府”的成员仅有四个人，现在设在圣马力诺边界上的一个未建成的翻砂厂里。
    共和国政府已经在2日颁布了建立志愿武装部队的指示。共和国内政部长戴米尼科·摩根蒂在一个记者招待会上说，志愿武装部队将维护公共秩序，并且要像圣马力诺的军事部队那样武装起来。在这个记者招待会举行的时候，约有一百名青年宣誓为第一批志愿兵。
    现在，由共产党和社会党人组成的圣马力诺民选政府仍然控制着这个三十八平方英里的国家的90％以上的土地。
    圣马力诺政府还打电报给意大利政府和联合国，指出“临时政府”是非法的，并且抗议意大利政府对圣马力诺的干涉。
    意大利政府已经在2日对圣马力诺实行全面的封锁，断绝对圣马力诺的粮食供应，企图借此来对共和国政府施加压力。意大利驻圣马力诺的领事德阿历克山德罗还出席了在意大利军队保护下在意大利边界召开的圣马力诺非法政府的会议，策划推翻共和国政府的阴谋。同时有消息说，已经有意大利的二十辆坦克和装甲车开到圣马力诺边境。意大利政府以保护意大利侨民为借口，企图伺机推翻这个国家的民主政府。
    意大利共产党和社会党的议员2日已经在议会中就圣马力诺事件对政府提出质问。他们斥责意大利政府干涉圣马力诺内政，并且反对承认在圣马力诺非法成立的“临时政府”。
    另据华盛顿消息：美国继意大利政府在10月3日宣布承认反动的所谓圣马力诺“临时政府”。美国国务院的发言人说：美国已经训令它的驻佛罗伦萨领事馆与这个“政府”进行接触。
