　　How Did We Open Up Sources of Materials?
　　Lin Wei, Deputy Director of Beijing Electronic Tube Factory

    The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory is one of the 156 key projects aided by the Soviet Union in China's construction. Like many newly built enterprises, after it was put into production, there was a fundamental contradiction: the contradiction between material supply and production. Many key materials, because they cannot be produced domestically at present, need to be imported from abroad. However, importing materials from abroad does not provide completely reliable guarantees in terms of foreign exchange, ordering, variety, quantity, and supply time. Because the material supply problem could not be resolved, five of the eighteen tube types we had just successfully trial-produced were forced to stop production, and other varieties were also threatened with suspension.

    Faced with this fundamental problem, there were two thoughts and two attitudes: one was to simply rely on foreign countries and wait passively. This approach would leave the enterprise's production in a passive state for a long time. The second attitude was to, on the one hand, order from foreign countries to solve the immediate problem; on the other hand, actively explore domestic sources of materials and organize the establishment of a material supply system adapted to the enterprise's production. This is a fundamental way out. Although there are countless difficulties on this road, it can open up a broad avenue. We chose the latter path.

    Under the guiding ideology of actively exploring domestic material sources, after more than a year of effort, we have achieved some significant results. Of the 647 foreign orders, 202 are already supplied domestically, and 279 have been successfully trial-produced or are being trial-produced domestically. The two items total 74.3% of the foreign order items. Of the foreign orders, 213 items are materials directly used in electronic tubes. Currently, 96 items are already supplied domestically, and 112 items have been successfully trial-produced or are being trial-produced. The two items total 97.6% of the 213 items. After the successful trial production or substitution of these materials, especially some key materials, it ensured that the entire factory could complete the state's output target for this year 100 days ahead of schedule, and also complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    The use of domestic materials can not only ensure normal production but also reduce costs, save a lot of foreign exchange, reduce reserves, and save working capital. According to statistics on 25 materials, using domestic materials to replace foreign materials can save 1.54 million yuan a year. This reduces the material cost in the cost of electronic tubes by 20%—30%. In 1958, foreign exchange can be reduced by 57.3% compared to 1957, and working capital can be saved by 17%.

    It is expected that, with the support of higher-level leadership and relevant industrial ministries, if we make persistent efforts and continue to work hard, a supply system of electro-vacuum materials can be basically formed domestically by 1959.

    The road to opening up domestic material sources has not been smooth. We have encountered many difficulties and problems. How did we solve these difficulties and problems?

    Establish a Correct Guiding Ideology for Material Supply

    There are two guiding ideologies for material supply: one is to rely on foreign countries and wait passively; the other is to actively explore domestic material sources and organize the establishment of a material supply system adapted to the enterprise's production. The first thought is the thought of a lazy person; the second thought is the correct guiding ideology.

    Our factory established this correct guiding ideology after actually experiencing and comprehensively analyzing the material supply situation. At the beginning of the factory's construction, because there was very little technical data and we were not confident, we did not pay enough attention to the trial production and substitution of materials. In the third quarter of 1956, as we approached the start of construction, the technical data had arrived, there were no materials for formal production, there was very little foreign exchange, ordering was difficult, and the need was very urgent. If the material problem could not be solved, production would stop after the start of construction. In this situation, we further realized the seriousness of the material problem and studied it in conjunction with China's material supply situation at that time. At that time, we concluded that the contradiction between material supply and production was not only our factory's main contradiction at that time but also the main contradiction for several years to come. The main reason for this contradiction was that China's industry was backward. We had a modern electro-vacuum enterprise, but there was no electro-vacuum material supply system adapted to it. The main method to solve this contradiction was to actively explore domestic material sources and organize the establishment of an electro-vacuum material supply system.

    Rely Closely on Higher-Level Leadership and Strive for Support from Relevant Ministries and Brother Factories

    The work of trial-producing new materials is a very complex task, which involves many industrial departments, as well as many complex technical and raw material problems. Therefore, it is impossible to rely on a single factory to organize and supervise the trial production work. In the first half of 1956, our factory did not deeply understand this problem, and we did not actively report the situation to the leadership enough, and we engaged in more independent activities. Although this also achieved some results, it took a lot of effort, a lot of time, and the effect was not great. In the third quarter of 1956, especially after production started in October, the leadership attached great importance to our factory's material problems, and we also took the initiative to report the material problems to the leadership in a more systematic way. In November of the same year, under the unified organization of the leadership, we went to Shanghai to arrange trial production work. Although it lasted less than two months, the achievements were greater than those obtained in the past two years. For example, in the past two years, only 132 material trial production agreements were signed. This time, 176 items were signed in Shanghai.

    In order to obtain support from relevant industrial ministries and brother factories, without revealing state secrets, we have adopted various forms to contact relevant industrial ministries and brother factories to strive for their help in material trial production work.

    We once invited responsible comrades from eight industrial ministries of the Central Government, as well as responsible comrades and engineering and technical personnel from relevant brother factories, to visit our factory. After the visit, they understood our difficulties and needs and were willing to help us. Some extended a helping hand while visiting. This created conditions for the smooth development of new material trial production work. Now, there are twelve provinces, twenty-eight cities, and sixty-eight enterprises that are trial-producing new materials for us. Of the 213 foreign materials directly used in electronic tubes, except for five that have not yet found a trial production unit, all the rest have found trial production units.

    Conduct Material Trial Production Work in a Planned Manner

    Because there are many trial production and substitution projects, including both production materials and auxiliary materials, it is not entirely like other work where one key can be grasped at a time. Instead, tens or even hundreds of key materials are indispensable, so it is necessary to carry out work in an organized and planned manner. For this reason, we have determined the principles of "comprehensive arrangement" and "combining trial production and supply" for the trial production personnel to master.

    In organizing material trial production and substitution work, we mainly paid attention to the following issues.

    First, advocate among designers to act according to China's specific circumstances. In the case where domestic raw materials have not yet been resolved, trial production can be carried out entirely in accordance with foreign technical standards; whenever there are domestic raw materials, new products should be trial-produced with domestic raw materials, so as not to fail to guarantee normal production after the new products are successfully trial-produced with foreign raw materials.

    Second, while striving for support from state-owned enterprises, we also pay attention to striving for support from local state-owned and joint state-private enterprises. Some materials that are small in quantity and have strict specifications are not easy to arrange in state-owned enterprises, but they are easy to arrange in local state-owned and joint state-private enterprises. Shanghai's local state-owned and joint state-private enterprises have trial-produced 176 new materials for us, including many important materials, such as seamless nickel tubes and aluminum-clad iron.

    Third, both oppose the factory taking on everything and oppose relying on foreign factories for everything. Whenever there are very important key materials where the conditions for trial production and supply in foreign factories are insufficient, and the factory has the conditions for trial production, we will do it ourselves. Copper-clad steel wire, quartz insulators, etc., are all trial-produced by our factory.

    In addition, we have also assigned special personnel to be responsible for organizing and arranging the re-inspection work of trial-produced materials, ensuring the timely and smooth re-inspection of material samples.

    Mobilize Employees to Overcome Difficulties and Happily Adopt Domestic Materials

    After domestic materials are successfully trial-produced, it is not an easy task to apply them in production. This is because: first, the quality of newly trial-produced materials is unstable. Second, many process documents, operating procedures, and molds need to be changed. Third, the masses of employees have many concerns, fearing that the quality of products is not guaranteed, fearing that it will affect the completion of production tasks, etc. For example, the replacement of nickel tape with double-sided aluminum-clad iron strip was successfully tested in December last year, but because there were still foreign aluminum-clad iron and nickel tape in the warehouse at that time, no one paid attention to the domestic aluminum-clad iron.

    The leadership analyzed this phenomenon and believed that the main reason was the failure to mobilize the masses. Based on this situation, we have taken a series of measures. Such as using various meetings to repeatedly explain to employees the seriousness of the material problem and the importance of actively adopting domestic materials; second, assigning specialized technical cadres or organizing special research groups to help the workshop solve the problems that occur in the adoption of domestic materials, etc.

    Now, the work of adopting domestic materials has been able to be carried out relatively smoothly.

### 我们是怎样开辟材料来源的？

　　我们是怎样开辟材料来源的？
　　北京电子管厂副厂长  林巍
    北京电子管厂是苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六项重点工程之一。它和许多新建企业一样，在投入生产以后存在着一个根本性的问题，就是材料供应和生产的矛盾。许多关键材料因为国内目前不能生产，便需要从国外进口；但是从国外进口材料，在外汇、订货、品种、数量和供应时间方面没有完全可靠的保证。由于材料供应问题解决不了，我们刚试制成功的十八种管型有五种曾被迫停产，其他品种也受到停产威胁。
    在这个根本问题面前，有两种思想、两种态度：一种是单纯依赖国外，消极等待。这种办法，将使企业的生产长期处于被动。第二种态度是，一方面向国外订货，解决燃眉之急；另一方面，在国内积极开辟材料来源，组织建立同企业生产相适应的材料供应体系。这是一条根本的出路。在这条道路上，虽然有无数的困难，但是却能开辟出一条阳关大道。我们就是选择了这后一条道路。
    在积极开辟国内材料来源的指导思想下，经过一年多的努力，我们已经取得了一些显著的成果。在六百四十七项国外订货中，有二百零二项国内已经供应，有二百七十九项国内已经试制成功或正在试制中。两项合计占国外订货项目的74.3％。国外订货中，直接用于电子管的材料有二百一十三项，目前有九十六项国内已经供应，有一百一十二项已经试制成功或正在试制中；两项合计占二百一十三项的97.6％。这些材料，特别是一些关键材料试制或代用成功以后，便保证了全厂能提前一百天完成国家所给予的今年的产量指标，同时提前完成了第一个五年计划。
    国内材料的采用，不仅可以保证正常生产，而且能降低成本，节约大量外汇，降低贮备，节约流动资金。据对二十五项材料的统计，用国内材料代替国外材料以后，一年可以节约一百五十四万元。这就使电子管成本中的材料费用降低20％—30％。1958年可以比1957年减少外汇57.3％，节约流动资金17％。
    预计，在上级领导和有关工业部的支援下，如果再接再厉，继续努力，到1959年便可以在国内基本上组成电真空材料供应体系。
    在开辟国内材料来源的道路上，并不是一帆风顺的，我们曾经遇到许多困难和问题。我们对这些困难和问题是怎样解决的呢？
    树立正确的材料供应指导思想
    材料供应的指导思想有两种：一种是依赖国外，消极等待；另一种是积极在国内开辟材料来源，组织建立同企业生产相适应的材料供应体系。第一种思想是懒汉思想；第二种思想才是正确的指导思想。
    我们厂是通过实际体会和全面分析材料供应情况以后才树立起这种正确的指导思想的。建厂一开始，因为技术资料很少，心中无数，我们没有十分重视试制和代用材料的工作。1956年第三季度，当接近开工之际，技术资料已经到达，正式生产用料尚无着落，外汇很少，订货困难，需要很急。如果材料问题解决不了，开工后就会停工。在这种情况下，我们进一步体会到材料问题的严重性，结合我国当时材料供应情况作了研究。当时得出结论：材料供应和生产的矛盾不仅是我们厂当时的主要矛盾，而且也是数年之内的主要矛盾。这个矛盾的造成，主要是因为我国工业落后，有了现代化的电真空企业，但是没有与其相适应的电真空材料供应体系。解决这个矛盾的主要方法，就是积极在国内开辟材料来源，组织建立电真空材料供应体系。
    紧紧依靠上级领导  争取有关部和兄弟厂的支援
    新材料试制工作是一个十分复杂的工作，它既牵联到许多工业部门，又牵联到许多复杂的技术问题和原料问题。因此，不能单靠一个厂去组织和督促试制工作。我们厂在1956年上半年对这个问题体会不深，主动地向领导上反映情况不够，单独活动较多，这样做虽然也取得了一些成绩，但是费力很大，时间很长，效果不大。1956年第三季度，特别是从10月份开工生产以后，领导上对我们厂材料问题非常重视，我们也主动地把材料问题向领导上作了比较系统的反映；同年11月，在领导上统一组织下，到上海去安排试制工作，虽然为时不足两月，但比过去两年获得的成绩还大。例如，在过去两年中只有一百三十二项材料签订了试制协议，这次在上海就签订了一百七十六项。
    为了取得有关工业部和兄弟厂的支援，在不暴露国家机密的原则下，我们曾采取各种形式，向有关工业部和兄弟厂联系，争取他们帮助进行材料试制工作。
    我们曾经邀请中央八个工业部的负责同志和有关兄弟厂的负责同志、工程技术人员到我厂参观。经过参观，他们了解了我们的困难和需要，都愿意帮助我们，有的一面参观一面就伸出了支援的手。这样就为顺利开展新材料试制工作创造了条件。现在已经有十二个省、二十八个城市、六十八个企业在为我们试制新材料；直接用于电子管的二百一十三项国外材料，除五项还没有找到试制单位以外，其余全部找到了试制单位。
    有计划地进行材料试制工作
    由于试制和代用项目很多，其中生产料和辅助料都有，它不完全像其他工作那样，一个时期抓一个关键就可以，而是几十项、甚至几百项关键材料没有哪一项都不行，所以需要有组织有计划地去进行工作。为此，我们曾确定了“全面安排”、“试制和供应相结合”的原则，供试制人员掌握。
    在组织材料试制和代用工作中，我们主要注意了以下几个问题。
    一、在设计人员中提倡根据中国具体情况办事。在国内原料还没有解决的情况下，可以完全依据国外技术标准进行试制；凡是有国内原料的就应该用国内原料试制新产品，以免用国外原料把新产品试制成功以后不能保证正常生产。
    二、在争取国营企业支援的同时，也注意争取地方国营和公私合营企业的支援。有些数量少规格要求严的材料，在国营企业中不好安排，在地方国营和公私合营企业中却容易安排。上海地方国营和公私合营企业就为我们试制了一百七十六项新材料，并且有很多重要材料，如无缝镍管和复铝铁等。
    三、既反对本厂包揽一切，又反对一切依靠外厂。凡是十分重要的关键性材料，外厂试制和供应条件不足，本厂又有条件试制的，就由自己干。铜包钢丝、石英绝缘子等都是本厂自己试制的。
    另外，我们还配备专人，负责组织和安排试制材料的复验工作，保证了及时、顺利地复验材料样品。
    发动职工克服困难  愉快地采用国产材料
    国产材料试制出来以后，要在生产中应用，也不是件容易的事情。这是因为：第一、刚试制成功的材料在质量上不稳定。第二、许多工艺文件和操作规程以及模具需要变更。第三、职工群众顾虑很多，怕产品质量没有保证，怕影响生产任务的完成等等。例如用双面复铝铁带代替镍带，在去年12月份就试验成功了，但是由于当时库内还有国外复铝铁和镍带，就没有人理睬国内复铝铁。
    领导上分析了这种现象，认为主要原因是没有发动群众。根据这一情况，我们采取了一系列的措施。如利用各种会议，反复地向职工说明了材料问题的严重性和积极采用国产材料的重要性；第二、指定专门技术干部或组织专题研究小组，帮助车间解决采用国产材料中发生的问题等等。
    现在，采用国产材料的工作已经能比较顺利地开展了。
