　　After mid-October, sweet potatoes in various regions ripen successively. Approximately 120 to 130 billion catties of fresh sweet potatoes across the country are harvested and stored during this season.

　　Sweet potatoes hold an extremely important position in China's grain production. In the major producing areas of Shandong, Hebei, and Henan, the sweet potato planting area accounts for 8% of the total grain crop area, and the yield accounts for 17% of the total grain output. Farmers in northern regions and dryland areas of the south rely on sweet potatoes for 20% to 50% of their rations. The success or failure of the sweet potato harvest and the ability to properly store the harvested sweet potatoes are closely related to whether the grain production task can be completed and whether the farmers' rations can be guaranteed.

　　Sweet potatoes have the disadvantage of not being easily stored. In 1954, Henan Province lost 800 million catties of grain due to rotten sweet potatoes, equivalent to the province's total increase in grain production for the entire year. Hebei Province loses about 15% of its sweet potatoes every year. Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan and other provinces also have similar situations. Therefore, preventing and reducing sweet potato rot is a very important matter.

　　In 1956, after the great development of cooperatives, sweet potato production was greatly improved due to improved technology; however, due to insufficient estimation of some contradictions that may arise from centralized production, sweet potato production also suffered some damage. In Hebei Province, some cooperatives concentrated all sweet potatoes in one or a few production teams, resulting in tight harvest schedules and difficulties in allocating labor, and sweet potatoes were not harvested until after "Minor Snow" (a solar term). Some cooperatives concentrated the harvest and then uniformly distributed it, with layers of handling and weighing from the cooperative to the team to the group to the household, causing serious damage and frost damage to the sweet potatoes, leading to a large amount of rot. This phenomenon must be prevented this year.

　　The experience of many regions has proved that the above-mentioned shortcomings can be overcome as long as the harvesting and storage of sweet potatoes are properly arranged. Last year, the Mabaoshan Agricultural Cooperative in Hanjiawa, Ding County, Hebei Province, and the Heping No. 2 Cooperative in Shangcai County, Henan Province, did a timely and careful job during harvest because they conducted block ranking and yield estimation before harvest and contracted to groups and households.

　　Under current conditions, it is still difficult to safely store fresh sweet potatoes. Therefore, vigorously promoting slicing and drying is still very necessary. When promoting this method, it is necessary to explain the reasons clearly to the farmers. As long as the masses understand the benefits of doing so, they are happy to accept it. In the past, the Shangqiu area of Henan Province had no habit of slicing and drying, but due to vigorous promotion and specific leadership, the sweet potatoes sliced and dried in the entire area in the autumn of last year accounted for 61% of the total output.

　　In order to adjust consumption and reserve seed potatoes, it is also necessary to store a certain amount of fresh potatoes. Agricultural departments at all levels must strengthen the technical instruction of storing fresh potatoes, especially seed potatoes, so that farmers can effectively master the methods of storing sweet potatoes, so as to avoid losses or reduce losses.

　　Sweet potatoes grow faster in the later stages. There is still some time before the sweet potato harvest in the south. While preparing for harvesting and storage, all sweet potato producing areas should also seize the final opportunity to improve the yield per unit area of sweet potatoes by strengthening field management in the later stages.

　　把甘薯收好藏好
　　本报评论员
    10月中旬以后，各地的甘薯相继成熟，全国约有一千二、三百亿斤的鲜薯在这个季节里收获和贮存。
    甘薯在我国粮食生产中的地位是极重要的。在山东、河北、河南几个主要产区，甘薯种植面积占粮食作物总面积的8％，产量占粮食总产量的17％。北方地区和南方的旱作地区的农民，有20％——50％的口粮是甘薯。甘薯收成的丰歉和能否把收获的甘薯贮藏好，密切关系着粮食生产任务的能否完成和农民口粮的能否保证。
    甘薯有不易贮存的缺点。1954年河南省腐烂甘薯折粮八亿斤，相当于该省全年粮食增产总额。河北省甘薯每年要损失15％左右。山东、江苏、安徽、广东、广西、四川等省份，也有同样情况。因此防止和减少甘薯的腐烂，是一件很重要的事情。
    1956年，合作社大发展以后，由于改进技术，大大地提高了甘薯的产量；但是，由于对于集中生产可能产生的一些矛盾估计不足，甘薯生产也受到一些损害。河北省有的合作社，因为将全部甘薯集中在一个或少数生产队中，以致收获时间紧迫，劳力调配不开，迟至“小雪”还没有把甘薯收回来。有的社集中收获后由社统一分配，从社到队到组到户，层层搬运过称，使甘薯遭到严重破损、冻害，引起大量腐烂。这种现象，今年必须注意防止。
    许多地区的经验证明，只要妥善安排好甘薯的收获、贮藏工作，上面所说的缺点是可以克服的。河北省定县韩家洼马宝山农业社和河南上蔡县和平二社去年由于在收获前进行地块排队、估产，并且包干到组到户，到收获的时候就做到了及时、精细。
    在目前条件下要做到安全地贮存鲜薯，还有一定困难。因此大力推行切片晒干还是十分必要的。在推行这一方法的时候，必须向农民说清道理。只要群众明白了这样作的好处，他们是乐于接受的。河南省商丘专区过去没有切片晒干的习惯，但是由于大力提倡和具体领导，去年秋季全专区切晒的甘薯占到总产量的61％。
    为了调剂食用和留作种薯，也还必须贮藏一定数量的鲜薯。各级农业部门必须加强对鲜薯特别是种薯贮藏的技术传授工作，使农民切实掌握贮藏甘薯的方法，作到不受损失或少受损失。
    甘薯后期生长较快。目前南方的甘薯距收获还有一段时间。各薯产区，在作好收获、贮藏准备工作的同时，还应该抓紧甘薯的后期田间管理，不要放过提高甘薯单位产量的最后机会。
