To the respected Chairman Mao:

    On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the birth of our great motherland, with extremely excited and joyful feelings, I, on behalf of the Tibetan monks and lay people, extend my heartfelt respect to you—the creator of the happy life of all our ethnic groups.

    Since the liberation of Tibet, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, all fraternal ethnic groups across the country have provided great help and support for the development of various undertakings in Tibet. Under your teachings, the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet and all the staff have correctly implemented the ethnic policies, greatly strengthening and consolidating the unity between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups and within Tibet itself. Tibet has achieved tremendous development in politics, economy, and culture, and the broad masses of people enjoy the rights of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief. We deeply realize that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and you can such tremendous achievements be made in such a short period of time, and only in the united, mutually supportive, equal, and friendly family of the motherland can we enjoy such profound care and warmth.

    Chairman Mao: The Tibetan people will forever be closely united around the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. Under your kind guidance, we will further strengthen unity, take practical actions to fight imperialism and love the country, stand on the same front with the people of the whole country, wage a resolute struggle against domestic bourgeois right-wingers and bad elements who attempt to split Tibet, and conscientiously implement all the resolutions and instructions of the central government. At present, because the conditions for reform in Tibet are not yet ripe, the central government has decided not to carry out democratic reforms in the Tibetan region for six years. This policy is completely correct. All of us, Tibetan monks and lay people, will resolutely implement this policy, thoroughly implement the Peaceful Liberation Agreement, create conditions for future reforms, and strive to build a prosperous and happy Tibet.

                  Panchen Erdeni

    班禅额尔德尼致电毛主席敬爱的毛主席：
    在我们伟大祖国诞生八周年之际，我以极其兴奋和愉快的心情，谨代表西藏僧俗人民向您——我们各族人民幸福生活的缔造者致以衷心的敬意。
    西藏解放以来，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的英明领导下，全国各兄弟民族对发展西藏的各项事业都给予了大力的帮助和支援，进藏人民解放军和全体工作人员在您的教导下，正确的执行了民族政策，使汉藏民族和西藏内部的团结大大地加强和巩固了。西藏在政治、经济、文化等方面都得到巨大的发展，广大人民享受到民族平等和宗教信仰自由的权利。我们深刻地体会到：只有在共产党和您的领导下，在短短的几年中才能得到如此巨大的成绩，也只有在团结互助、平等友爱的祖国大家庭中，我们才能享受到如此深厚的关怀和温暖。
    毛主席：西藏人民将永誓紧密地团结在中国共产党和中央人民政府的周围，在您亲切的教导下，进一步地加强团结，用反帝爱国的实际行动，和全国人民站在一条战线上，与国内资产阶级右派分子和企图分裂西藏的坏分子作坚决的斗争，认真执行中央的各项决议和指示。现在西藏因改革条件尚不成熟，中央确定在西藏地区六年内不进行民主改革。这个方针是完全正确的，我们全体西藏僧俗人民将坚决贯彻这个方针，彻底执行和平协议，给今后的改革创造条件，为建设繁荣幸福的西藏而奋斗。
                  班禅额尔德尼
