Xinhua News Agency, 14th Dispatch: The Beijing-Pingxiang and Beijing-Guangzhou express trains, prepared to pass through the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, departed from Beijing today, fully loaded with passengers.

　　The Beijing-Pingxiang train will be the first passenger train to pass through the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.

　　The entire journey from Beijing to Pingxiang is two thousand seven hundred and ninety-two kilometers, which is four hundred and sixty-seven kilometers longer than the Beijing-Manzhouli route, currently the longest train route in our country.

　　According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch, the first direct trains between Guangzhou-Beijing and Pingxiang-Beijing, which will pass through the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge on the 15th, departed from Guangzhou and Nanning stations respectively on the morning of the 14th. These two trains will travel directly to Beijing via the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 13th Dispatch: The people of Wuhan are enthusiastically welcoming the opening ceremony of the Yangtze River Bridge. The brand-new Yangtze River Bridge has been decorated to make it even more beautiful and magnificent. On the vermilion celebration arches on both sides of the bridgehead, workers are installing the final gilded carvings. Nearly two hundred red flags are fluttering in the wind along the silver-gray balustrades of the bridge deck. More than a thousand electric lights have also been installed on the eaves and roofs of the four bridgehead pavilion towers. At night, the Yangtze River Bridge is brightly lit, resembling a bridge inlaid with pearls.

　　On the newly laid grass slope on the Hanyang bank, gardeners used yellow and cyan pebbles to construct brave seagulls soaring above the turbulent waves. On the Wuchang bank, gardeners used red and green flowers and plants to create a peace dove spreading its wings and the words "Long Live Peace."

　　通过长江大桥的列车从北京广州等站开出
    新华社14日讯　准备通过武汉长江大桥的北京——凭祥、北京——广州直达快车，今天满载旅客由北京开出。
    北京——凭祥列车将作为第一列通过武汉长江大桥的客车。
    由北京到凭祥全程两千七百九十二公里，比我国目前行车里程最长的北京——满洲里线路还要长四百六十七公里。
    据新华社讯　将在15日通过武汉长江大桥的广州——北京、凭祥——北京间的首次直达列车，已在14日早晨分别由广州、南宁车站开出。这两趟列车将通过武汉长江大桥直达北京。
    据新华社武汉13日电　武汉人民正在热情地迎接长江大桥通车典礼。崭新的长江大桥已经被人们打扮得越发美丽、雄伟。在两岸桥头米红色的庆祝彩坊上，工人们正在安装最后的抹金雕花。沿着桥面的银灰色的花栏杆上，迎风飘展着近两百面红旗。四座桥头堡亭阁的亭檐、亭顶上，也装饰了一千多盏电灯。夜晚，长江大桥上灯火灿烂，像一座嵌满珍珠的桥梁。
    园林工人们在汉阳岸新铺的草坡上，用黄色、青色鹅卵石砌筑成一支支勇敢的海燕，在惊涛骇浪之上翱翔；在武昌岸，园丁们用红绿间杂的花草，铺成了一支展翅飞翔的和平鸽和“和平万岁”的字样。
