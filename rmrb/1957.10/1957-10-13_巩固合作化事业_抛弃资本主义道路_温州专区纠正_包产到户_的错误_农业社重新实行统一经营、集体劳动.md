Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Electric Dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporter Yi Xintian reports: Wenzhou Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, is correcting the principled and directional error of implementing the "household contract system" in agricultural cooperatives, which deviates from the socialist road. The vast majority of the approximately one thousand agricultural cooperatives in the prefecture that implemented the "household contract system" have re-implemented unified management and collective labor, and more than 100,000 peasant households that had effectively gone it alone have returned to the path of collectivization.

The "household contract system" involves contracting the "three guarantees" (guaranteed work, guaranteed output, and guaranteed cost) from the cooperative to the production team, and then to each member household. The cooperative's contiguous land is broken up and re-divided into small plots, determining the output, fertilizer, and labor required for each plot. Generally, the method of "land allocation based on labor" is used to contract the land to each member household for decentralized management. Members are fully responsible for the output of the contracted land, with all excess production being rewarded and all shortfalls being compensated. Members engage in individual production during normal times, with small-group mutual aid during busy seasons, and everyone participates in cooperative-wide farm work. The cooperative's farm tools are allocated to households or used in rotation.

This method was initiated by Li Yunhe, Deputy Secretary of the Yongjia County Party Committee, who sent people to agricultural cooperatives for experimentation last year. Li Yunhe mistakenly believed that the "household contract system" could mobilize the enthusiasm of peasants and was a good way to solve the main contradictions within the cooperative. Therefore, he introduced it to district and township cadres in Yongjia County last winter and instructed each district to conduct more experiments. During the experiments, it was welcomed and supported by wealthy middle peasants. Many cadres who lacked management methods for agricultural cooperative production also considered it a new method at the time and agreed to pilot it. This spring, more than two hundred cooperatives in Yongjia County implemented the "household contract system." Although most cadres in Yongjia County opposed it, and the Yongjia County Party Committee also made a resolution to stop its promotion, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and the Wenzhou Prefectural Committee also pointed out its errors, but because of insufficient understanding of the capitalist nature and serious harm of the "household contract system," it was not resolutely corrected. By this summer, a bad trend of implementing the "household contract system" had emerged in various counties of Wenzhou Prefecture, with a total of about one thousand agricultural cooperatives, including more than 178,000 member households (accounting for about 15% of the member households), implementing this erroneous practice.

According to the reflections of peasants in the course of the Great Blooming and Great Contending, the harm of the "household contract system" is very great. All cooperatives that implemented the "household contract system" actually regressed from unified management and collective labor to decentralized management and individual farming, becoming "legal individual farming wearing the hat of a cooperative."

After these cooperatives implemented the "household contract system," production was decentralized to individual households, and harvest and income were determined by individual labor. In this way, a small number of wealthy peasants with sufficient funds, more fertilizer, strong labor, and good production conditions were elated and could increase production and income, while the majority of poor and lower-middle peasants with poor production conditions faced difficulties again. Some poor peasants said: "After the 'household contract system,' we are empty-handed again." Elderly and sick members who used to do light work in the cooperative found it difficult to cultivate the contracted land, and some had to hire laborers, while others left the land barren, reducing their income. "Five guarantees" households and households in difficulty also lost the support of the cooperative. Therefore, various forms of exploitation, such as mortgaging land, renting land, hiring labor, usury, and selling green crops, reappeared in many villages. In Xixin and Xiaokeng villages in Yongjia County, more than 60 poor and lower-middle peasant households mortgaged or rented land or sold green crops after the "household contract system." After the "household contract system" was implemented in Panshan Cooperative in Wencheng County, 13 out of 65 member households sold their land. In cooperatives that implemented the "household contract system," the contradictions of mutual aid groups reappeared, most notably the competition for cattle and farm tools during the busy farming season. Most of the early rice production in cooperatives that implemented the "household contract system" in Yongjia, Ruian, Pingyang, and other counties decreased this year.

It is difficult for cooperatives that implement the "household contract system" to correctly handle the relationship between the state, the agricultural cooperative, and the members. Due to decentralized management, they cannot accept the guidance of the state plan, cannot implement the policy of comprehensive development of production, especially in the implementation of the state grain policy, they cannot calculate, levy, purchase, and sell grain on a cooperative basis, which undermines the "three fix" policy for grain. A small number of wealthy peasants conceal their output, steal grain, resist unified purchase and sale, refuse to hand over public grain, and refuse to sell surplus grain, selling grain at high prices on the black market.

After the launch of the socialist propaganda and education movement in rural areas of Wenzhou Prefecture, Wu Zhichuan, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, and Li Tiefeng and Li Wenhui, Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Wenzhou Prefectural Party Committee, went to rural areas one after another to investigate and study. Then, they pointed out to cadres that the "household contract system" was a principled and directional error, which was guiding peasants away from the socialist road, causing great damage to the cooperative movement and the interests of poor and lower-middle peasants, and promoting the development of capitalist forces in rural areas. At an enlarged meeting held in mid-August, the Wenzhou Prefectural Party Committee launched a debate and criticism of the "household contract system," unified understanding, and decided to resolutely and thoroughly correct this erroneous practice. Various counties in Wenzhou Prefecture also conducted criticism and debate among cadres, and many cadres examined their right-leaning thoughts. At the Yongjia County Representative Conference held in late September, Li Yunhe's errors were severely criticized, and Li Yunhe made a self-criticism at the meeting.

Now, the vast majority of cooperatives in Wenzhou Prefecture that implemented the "household contract system" have been corrected. In these cooperatives, the production enthusiasm of poor and lower-middle peasants has been significantly improved. They are working together to repair ponds, fight drought, eliminate pests, and apply fertilizer, making the late rice a lush green again. Many cooperatives that have corrected the "household contract system" have also quickly completed their grain purchase tasks.

    巩固合作化事业　抛弃资本主义道路
    温州专区纠正“包产到户”的错误
    农业社重新实行统一经营、集体劳动
    新华社杭州电　新华社记者伊心恬报道：浙江省温州专区纠正在农业社实行“包产到户”这个离开社会主义道路的原则性路线的错误。全专区实行“包产到户”的约一千个农业社，绝大多数已经重新实行统一经营、集体劳动，十多万户实际上已经单干的农民重新走上了合作化的道路。
    “包产到户”是把社里“三包”（包工、包产、包成本）包到生产队后，再包到每户社员；把社里成片土地重新打乱划成小块，确定每块田的产量、肥料和所需工数，一般用“按劳分田”办法，包给每户社员去分散经营。社员对承包土地的产量负完全责任，超产部分全部奖励，减产部分全部赔偿。平时社员单独生产，农忙时小组互助，全社性农活大家出工。社里农具搭配到户，或者轮流使用。
    这个办法是中共永嘉县委副书记李云河去年派人到农业社试验然后搞起来的。李云河错误地认为“包产到户”能调动农民的积极性，是解决社内主要矛盾的好办法，于是在去年冬季向永嘉县的区乡干部作介绍，并布置各区多作试验。在试验中，受到了富裕中农的欢迎和拥护，不少对农业社生产管理缺乏办法的干部，当时也认为这是个新办法，赞成试行。今年春天，永嘉县便有二百多个社实行了“包产到户”。虽然永嘉县的大多数干部反对，中共永嘉县委也作出停止推广的决议，中共浙江省委和温州地委也都指出其错误，但由于对“包产到户”的资本主义本质和严重的危害性认识不足，没有坚决地纠正。到今年夏季，温州专区各县曾出现一股搞“包产到户”的歪风，共约有一千个农业社、包括十七万八千多户社员（占入社农户15％左右），实行了这个错误的做法。
    据各地农民在大鸣大放中反映，“包产到户”的危害性很大。凡是搞“包产到户”的社，实际上由统一经营、集体劳动倒退为分散经营、个人单干，成为“戴着合作社帽子的合法单干”。
    这些社实行“包产到户”后，以户为单位分散生产，收成和收入决定于个人的劳动，这样，资金足、肥料多、劳力强、生产条件好的少数富裕农民兴高采烈，可以增产增收，大多数生产条件差的贫农、下中农重新发生了困难。有的贫农说：“‘包产到户’后，我们又是赤手空拳了。”原来在社里做些轻活的老年社员和有病的社员，承包土地后很多种不下去，有的人只好雇工种，有的人荒了田，减少了收入，“五保”户和困难户也失去了合作社的依靠。因此，不少乡村又出现了当田、租田、雇工、高利贷、卖青苗等各种剥削现象。永嘉县溪心、小坑两个村就有六十多户贫农、下中农在“包产到户”后当田租田或卖青苗；文成县潘山社“包产到户”后，六十五户社员中有十三户出卖了土地。在“包产到户”的社里，互助组的矛盾重新出现，最明显的是在农忙季节争牛、争农具。永嘉、瑞安、平阳等县实行“包产到户”的社，今年早稻大多数减产。
    实行“包产到户”的社很难正确处理国家、农业社和社员三者之间的关系。由于分散经营，不能接受国家计划指导，不能贯彻全面发展生产的方针，特别是在执行国家粮食政策上，不能以社为单位计征计购计销，这就破坏了粮食“三定”政策，少数富裕农民便隐瞒产量，偷窃粮食，对抗统购统销，不交公粮，不卖余粮，把粮食在黑市上高价出售。
    温州专区农村开展社会主义宣传教育运动以后，中共浙江省委农村工作部部长吴植椽和中共温州地委书记、副书记李铁峰、李文辉等人，都先后到农村去调查研究，然后向干部指出“包产到户”是原则性路线性的错误，是引导农民离开社会主义道路，使合作化事业和贫农、下中农的利益受到了很大的损害，助长了农村资本主义势力的发展。中共温州地委在8月中旬召开的扩大会议上，对“包产到户”开展了辩论和批判，统一了认识，决定坚决、彻底地纠正这种错误做法。温州专区各县也在干部中进行了批判和辩论，许多干部检查了自己的右倾思想。在9月下旬召开的中共永嘉县代表大会，严厉地批评了李云河的错误，李云河在会上作了检讨。
    现在温州专区实行“包产到户”的社，绝大多数已经纠正，在这些社里，贫农、下中农的生产情绪显著提高，他们在一起修塘、抗旱、除虫、下肥，使晚稻又一片油绿了。许多纠正“包产到户”的社还迅速地完成了粮食征购任务。
