Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 17th: The anti-rightist struggle in the first group of rectification units in Tianjin has basically concluded victoriously, and they are gradually moving into a stage focused on rectification and launching a socialist great debate.

Of the more than 300 units in Tianjin participating in the first group of rectification, most have already concluded the struggle, with the exception of a small number that are still continuing the anti-rightist struggle. Nearly half of these units have already moved into the stage of rectification as the main focus and launching a great debate. According to the instructions of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, a rectification upsurge is forming throughout the city. The Municipal Committee requires all units to strengthen leadership, study and solve the problems raised by the masses, and thoroughly correct shortcomings and errors. Leading municipal organs should also help solve problems at the lower levels. Some major issues, such as those related to systems and institutions, will also be studied, and improvement plans will be proposed. Streamlining institutions and transferring cadres to lower levels will be one of the main issues during the rectification and modification process. The city will transfer one-third of its personnel to grassroots units and production posts.

　　天津首批整风单位转入整改
    据新华社天津17日电  天津市第一批整风单位的反右派斗争基本上胜利结束，正在逐步转入整改为主和开展社会主义大辩论的阶段。
    天津市参加第一批整风的三百多个单位，目前除少数单位还在继续进行反右派斗争外，大部分单位都已经结束了斗争。其中有将近半数的单位已经转入整改为主和开展大辩论阶段，根据中共天津市委的指示，全市正在形成一个整改的高潮。市委要求各单位加强领导，研究和解决群众提出的问题，彻底改正缺点和错误。市级领导机关也要帮助下面解决问题。对一些重大问题，如有关制度、机构等，也将进行研究，提出改进方案。紧缩机构，下放干部，将是边整边改中的主要问题之一。全市将抽调三分之一的人员下放到基层单位和生产岗位。
