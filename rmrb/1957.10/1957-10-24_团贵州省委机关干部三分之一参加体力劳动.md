The first group of cadres from the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League to go to the countryside and factories to participate in manual labor departed on the 16th for Taijiang County, a Miao ethnic minority area in a remote mountainous region, and Shuicheng County in western Guizhou.
    This group of cadres numbers twenty-seven, accounting for one-third of the existing cadres of the Provincial Committee of the League, including ten members of the Provincial Committee. They will participate in manual labor for a period of one year or more.
    Before their departure, more than 1,700 grassroots cadres of the Communist Youth League from agencies, schools, and factories in Guiyang City held a grand send-off meeting.
