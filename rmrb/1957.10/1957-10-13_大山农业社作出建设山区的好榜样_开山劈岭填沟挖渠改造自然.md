The Dashing Mountain Agricultural Cooperative Sets a Good Example for Building Mountainous Areas
	Blasting Mountains, Filling Gullies, and Digging Ditches to Transform Nature
	Editor's Note: The Dashing Mountain Agricultural Cooperative's heroic feat of blasting mountains, transforming nature, and building mountainous areas is an inspiring example of the "Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains" spirit in transforming nature. This heroic cooperative vividly demonstrates the excellent qualities of hard work and the fearless spirit of the Chinese working people. Its success convincingly proves a truth: even mountainous areas with very poor natural conditions possess enormous potential for developing production. The problem is whether people have the determination to overcome all hardships and difficulties to tap it. The success of the Dashing Mountain Agricultural Cooperative makes us even more confident that as long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party, leverage the superiority of the cooperative system, infinitely promote the collective strength and wisdom of the broad masses, and possess the steadfast perseverance of the "Foolish Old Man Who Moved Mountains," the face of any poor and backward mountainous area can be fundamentally changed. Some people believe that mountain production has no future, which is completely wrong.
	There are many good examples like the Dashing Mountain Agricultural Cooperative that have successfully transformed and built mountainous areas across the country. We suggest that local leading organs earnestly summarize the typical experiences in this area and disseminate them widely.
	This newspaper reports: The Dashing Mountain Agricultural Cooperative in Lijiazhai Township, Junan County, Shandong Province, a revolutionary old base area, relying on the collective strength of the cooperative system and with heroic spirit, waged a persistent struggle against the harsh natural environment, creating a good example for building mountainous areas.
	The people of Lijiazhai Township have long lived in poor and disaster-prone mountain gullies. The characteristics of this place are numerous bare mountains and ridges, crisscrossing ravines, and severe soil erosion that has destroyed the land, leaving it riddled with holes and fragmented. Among the township's more than six thousand five hundred mu of arable land, only one thousand one hundred mu are relatively flat. The rest are small plots of land with a lot of gravel or sloping and uneven terraced fields, where often a dozen plots are needed to make up one mu. Every year, three to five hundred mu of crops are washed away by mountain floods; a severe drought occurs after only a few days without rain. Before liberation, the people here lived in hunger and cold. At that time, more than seventy households in the township begged for food year-round, more than ninety households fled to the Northeast to escape famine, and one hundred and eighty households worked as hired laborers. After liberation in 1942, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the farmers of this township overcame all difficulties and tried their best to increase production. Since the establishment of agricultural cooperatives in the winter of 1953, the farmers of the entire township have launched a large-scale struggle against nature with organized strength.
	Because the cultivated land has many stones, thin soil, and extremely low yields, the struggle began with improving the cultivated land. During the Spring Festival of 1954, when a production team was removing a cliff on a piece of land, they dug up a large rock that occupied more than one mu. After digging for a day, twelve pickaxes broke ten of them, but the rock remained unmoved! However, people were not intimidated by the stubborn rock. Regardless of the frozen and broken wounds on their hands, they spent half a month finally crushing the large rock, and it took four hundred carts to transport the crushed stones away. After thirteen primary cooperatives merged into the Dashing Mountain Agricultural Cooperative (advanced cooperative) in the winter of 1955, the strength of the struggle became even greater. That winter, under the slogans of "blasting ridges and filling gullies" and "let the river change its course and let the land be transformed," the farmers spent more than five months leveling eleven ridge tops, filling in twenty-one large pits and more than three hundred gullies, and changing the courses of five small rivers, thereby reorganizing more than a thousand scattered plots of land into one hundred and eighteen large plots of cultivated land, expanding the cultivated area by one hundred and ninety-two mu, and turning hillsides and gullies into fertile fields.
	In order to resist floods and droughts and protect farmland and homes, the Dashing Mountain Agricultural Cooperative vigorously carried out water and soil conservation work such as damming mountain gullies, building reservoirs, leveling terraces, and closing hills for afforestation, and gradually created a complete set of flood control, water storage, and soil conservation methods in the process of practice. In the spring of 1955, the cooperative dug twenty-five wells and built a canal that could divert river water to irrigate five hundred mu of terraced fields on the mountain. In the winter of the same year, they tunneled through three ridges and built eleven reservoirs, along with those previously built, totaling more than two thousand dammed mountain gullies and seven hundred and nineteen stone wells. The victory of water conservancy construction has transformed three thousand six hundred mu of dry land into irrigated land, and has exempted almost all farmland from the destruction of mountain floods.
	Due to the successful transformation of natural conditions, coupled with the implementation of various production-increasing measures, the production of the Dashing Mountain Agricultural Cooperative is thriving. 1955 was a bumper year, with an average grain yield of 549 jin per mu. In 1956, the year of advanced cooperativization, despite the rare major floods and wind disasters, the average grain yield per mu still reached 552.8 jin, with approximately 85% of the members increasing their income and 60% of the members' living standards catching up with those of prosperous middle peasants. This year, extremely serious floods, droughts, and wind disasters occurred again. After vigorously fighting disasters to protect the harvest, it is estimated that the average grain yield per mu can still reach 430 jin.
	In the process of building mountainous areas and developing production, the Party branch of Lijiazhai Township and the leading cadres of the Dashing Mountain Agricultural Cooperative paid close attention to using the mass line method of work. Every capital construction project and every new production technology is implemented only after mobilizing the members of the cooperative to fully discuss, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, and break through the thinking of the masses. For example, this spring, when the cooperative responded to the call to strive for a bumper harvest in every possible way, some members and cadres believed that after several years of efforts, the potential for increased production had been almost fully tapped. The cooperative committee then convened a symposium of veteran farmers to ask them for ways to further increase production, and the veteran farmers put forward more than ten suggestions. The leaders concentrated the opinions of the masses, gave specific topics, and mobilized all members to discuss, and as a result, the masses put forward a total of one hundred and six "strategies" to increase production. A hot and bustling upsurge of production in "striving for a bumper harvest in every possible way" was thus set off.

　　大山农业社作出建设山区的好榜样
    开山劈岭填沟挖渠改造自然
    编者按　大山农业合作社开山劈岭、改造自然、建设山区的壮举，是一个令人鼓舞的愚公移山改造自然的好榜样。这个英雄的合作社，生动地表现了我国劳动人民勤苦耐劳的优良品质和大无畏的精神。它的成功令人信服地证明了一条真理：即使是自然条件非常坏的山区，也蕴藏着巨大的发展生产的潜在能力，问题是人们是否有决心战胜一切艰难困苦去挖掘它。大山农业社成功的事实，使我们更加相信：只要加强党的领导，发挥合作制度的优越性，只要无限地发扬广大群众的集体力量和集体智慧，只要有愚公移山的坚强的毅力，任何贫困、落后的山区的面貌，都可以从根本上改变过来。有些人认为山区生产没有发展前途，这种思想是完全错误的。
    像大山农业合作社这样成功地改造和建设山区的好例子，全国各地都有不少。我们建议各地领导机关认真地总结这方面的典型经验，并且加以广泛传播。
    本报讯　革命老根据地山东省莒南县厉家寨乡的大山农业合作社，依靠合作制度的集体力量，以英雄的气魄同恶劣的自然环境进行了坚持不懈的斗争，创造了建设山区的好榜样。
    厉家寨乡的人民长期生活在贫瘠多灾的山沟里。这个地方的特点是秃山秃岭多，沟壑纵横，严重的水土流失现象把土地破坏得千疮百孔，支离破碎。全乡六千五百多亩可耕地中间，比较平展的地只有一千一百亩，其余都是“瓢一块、碗一块”的石砾特多的小块地和倾斜不平的梯田，往往十几块地才能凑成一亩。每年都有三、五百亩庄稼都被山洪冲毁；几天不下雨就出现严重的旱灾。解放前，这里的人们过着饥寒交迫的生活。那时全乡有七十多户常年讨饭，九十多户逃荒到东北，一百八十户当雇工。1942年解放后，这个乡的农民就在共产党和人民政府的领导下，克服一切困难，尽力增加生产。而自从1953年冬建立起农业合作社以后，全乡农民就以有组织的力量，向自然界展开了大规模的斗争。
    因为耕地石多土薄，产量极低，所以斗争首先就从改良耕地开始。1954年春节，有一个生产队在一块地上铲除一个崖头的时候，刨出了一块占地一亩多的大石头，刨了一天，十二把镐头刨断了十把，而石头还是屹然不动！但是人们没有被顽石吓倒，他们不顾手上冻破和磨破的伤口，用半月的时间终于把这块大石头粉碎，运了四百车才把碎石运走。1955年冬季，十三个初级社合并成大山农业社（高级社）以后，斗争的力量更雄厚了。这年冬天，农民们在“劈岭填沟”、“让河水改道，让土地翻身”的口号下，用五个多月时间，夷平了十一个岭头，填平了二十一个大坑、三百多道水沟，并使五条小河改了河道，从而把一千多块零碎土地整理成一百一十八块大片耕地，扩大了耕地面积一百九十二亩，使山坡和沟壑变成了良田。
    为了抗御水旱灾害，保护农田和家园，大山农业合作社用大力进行了闸山沟、修水库、整梯田、封山造林等项水土保持工作，并且在实践过程中逐渐创造了一套完整的防洪、蓄水、保土的办法。1955年春天，这个社打了二十五眼水井，修了一道可以引河水灌溉山上五百亩梯田；同年冬天，又凿通了三道岭，修起了十一座水库，连同以前做的在内，共闸山沟二千多道，砌成七百一十九眼石井。水利建设的胜利使得三千六百亩旱田变成了水浇田，使得几乎全部的农田免除山洪的毁坏。
    由于胜利地改造了自然条件，加上在生产方面推行了各种增产措施，大山农业合作社的生产在欣欣向荣地发展着。1955年是个丰收年，平均每亩粮食产量五百四十九斤。高级合作化的1956年，在往年少见的大水灾、风灾的情况下，平均每亩粮食产量仍然达到五百五十二点八斤，约有85％的社员增加了收入，60％的社员的生活水平赶上了富裕中农。今年又发生了极严重的涝灾、旱灾和风灾，经过大力抗灾保收，估计平均每亩粮食产量仍可达到四百三十斤。
    厉家寨乡的党支部和大山农业社的领导干部在建设山区和发展生产的过程中，十分注意运用群众路线的工作方法。每一项基本建设的进行，每一项新的生产技术的实施，事前都要发动社员群众充分讨论，集中群众的智慧，打通群众的思想。例如今年春季，当合作社响应千方百计争取大丰收的号召时，有些社员和干部认为：经过几年来的努力，增产潜力已经挖得差不多了。社委会就召开老农座谈会，向他们请教进一步增产的办法，老农们提出了十多条建议。领导上集中群众的意见，出具体的题目，发动全体社员讨论，结果群众共提出了一百零六条增产的“计策”。一个热火朝天的“千方百计争取大丰收”的生产高潮，就这样掀起来了。
