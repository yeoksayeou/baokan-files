Draw a Lesson from Liu Shaotang's Degeneration
By People's Daily Commentator

　　Today, this newspaper publishes the news of the criticism of the anti-Party activities of young literary and art worker Liu Shaotang by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Chinese Writers Association. Liu Shaotang's example proves once again that if literary and art workers are not constantly vigilant against the growth of bourgeois individualism; if they regard the literary career as a means to satisfy personal desires for fame and gain; if they detach themselves from the people, reject the leadership and supervision of the Party, then no matter how talented they are, they will inevitably degenerate and fall, until they finally cannot help but roll into the rightist mire of the bourgeoisie.

　　Liu Shaotang is only twenty-two years old this year. He was only thirteen years old at the time of liberation. Thanks to the cultivation of the Party and the new society, he wrote several relatively good works and received support and encouragement from the literary circles and readers. If Liu Shaotang has any literary writing talent, it is inseparable from the Party's cultivation of him. Liu Shaotang himself cannot but admit that he is "a young man directly cultivated by the Party, and even the slightest achievement is permeated with the Party's painstaking efforts."

　　Why, in just a few years, did Liu Shaotang degenerate from a young author of the Communist Party to a bourgeois rightist element who is anti-Party and anti-socialist?

　　Liu Shaotang was originally a relatively simple young man from the countryside. His first few works showed that he still had some feelings for the rural working people. However, after publishing a few works, gaining a little fame, and receiving some praise from people, he became dizzy, arrogant, and conceited. He touted himself as a "prodigy" and "talented scholar," posing as a "genius writer." It seems that his few immature works have already become a "climate" in the Chinese literary world and have become a "literary school" with a unique style. He arrogantly boasted that he was the "Hebei School" and "Beijing School" in the Chinese literary world and called himself the "Chinese Sholokhov School." He forgot the Party's cultivation of him and looked down on the working people. He bought a house in Beijing to live in as a "professional writer." Occasionally, when he went to the countryside, he had to bring his own meals because he couldn't eat the food in the countryside. He was also unwilling to live the Party's life. He believed that organizational life would hinder his creation and restrain his "talent." In this way, he felt that he was already more intelligent than the Party and the people. Like other rightist elements, he attacked the Party's literary and art policies, negated the achievements of socialist literature, believed that the Party could not lead literature and art, and wrote some works that slandered the people and defamed the socialist system.

　　This is how Liu Shaotang degenerated. This shows Liu Shaotang's arrogance and ignorance, but more importantly, his bourgeois individualism is at work. We should not underestimate the harm of this ideology because of his ignorance. Many young literary people lack the tempering of class struggle and production labor. Although they grew up in the new society after liberation, they still have serious bourgeois individualistic thoughts. The anti-Party elements in the literary and art circles spread and advocate this ideology among them, making it even more rampant. If this ideology is not overthrown, the development of our literary undertaking will be hindered, and the growth of young literary people will be harmed. The broad masses of young literary and art workers should draw profound lessons from Liu Shaotang's degeneration and be constantly vigilant against the erosion of bourgeois individualistic thoughts. To achieve success in literary creation and to become a true revolutionary literary artist, one must first be a revolutionary fighter; a Party member writer must first be a good Party member. Anyone who puts himself above the Party and the masses like Liu Shaotang, does not listen to the Party, is unwilling to share the joys and sorrows of the masses, is arrogant and complacent, and looks down on everything, will inevitably be abandoned by the times and the people.

　　Liu Shaotang's degeneration, in addition to his serious bourgeois individualistic thoughts, also shows that there are shortcomings in the literary and art circles in dealing with young authors. Many young people like Liu Shaotang were transferred from their actual jobs to become professional writers after writing one or two works. In this way, they not only lost the constant education and supervision of certain revolutionary organizations but also lost contact with the people and lost the source of creation. In recent years, there has also been a bad trend of blindly praising young writers, which has also fueled the arrogance and complacency of some of them. This is a lesson. In the future, young literary and art workers should not be professionalized too early. They should go to factories, rural areas, or other grassroots work units to take on certain practical jobs or directly participate in production labor. They should temper themselves in the labor and struggle of workers and peasants, thoroughly transform their non-working-class thoughts and feelings, accumulate life experience, and obtain rich sources of creation and artistic feelings. Premature specialization is very harmful to young literary and art workers who are lacking in life experience, creative experience, and social knowledge. Young literary and art workers should be cultivated and encouraged, and at the same time, they should be strictly required. Relevant Party organizations and agencies should strengthen the political and ideological education of young literary and art workers and cultivate them into true working-class literary artists.

　　从刘绍棠的堕落吸取教训
　　本报评论员
    今天本报登载了共产主义青年团中央和中国作家协会等单位批判青年文艺工作者刘绍棠的反党活动的消息。从刘绍棠的例子，又一次证明：文艺工作者如果不时时刻刻警惕资产阶级个人主义思想的滋长；如果把文学事业当作满足个人名利欲望的手段；如果脱离人民、拒绝党的领导和监督，那末，不管他有多大才能，他就必然会蜕化、堕落，以致最后不能不滚到资产阶级的右派泥坑中去。
    刘绍棠今年只有二十二岁。解放那年，他才十三岁。由于党和新社会的培育，他写出了几篇还算好的作品，得到了文学界和读者的支持和鼓励。如果刘绍棠有一点文学写作的才能的话，那是和党对他的培养分不开的。刘绍棠自己也不能不承认他是“一个直接由党栽培起来的青年，即使有星星点点的成绩，也都是渗透着党的心血的。”
    为什么在短短的几年中，刘绍棠会从一个共产党员的青年作者堕落成为反党反社会主义的资产阶级右派分子呢？
    刘绍棠本来是一个来自农村的比较纯朴的青年，他最初写的几篇作品，还表现了他对农村劳动人民多少有一些感情。但是，发表了几篇作品，有了一点小名气，得到了人们的一些赞颂，就冲昏头脑，骄傲、狂妄起来了。他自诩是什么“神童”、“才子”，俨然以“天才作家”自居。好像他那几篇还不脱幼稚的作品，在中国的文坛上已经成了“气候”，已经成为有独特风格的“文学流派”了。他狂妄地吹嘘自己是中国文坛上的“河北派”、“北京派”，并以“中国的萧洛霍夫派”自命。他忘记了党对他的栽培，也看不起劳动人民了。他在北京买了房子住下来做“专业作家”，偶尔下乡，要自己带伙食去，因为他吃不下乡下的饭菜了。党的生活也不愿意过了，他认为组织生活会妨碍他的创作，束缚他的“才能”。这样，他就觉得自己已经比党和人民更高明，他就和其他右派分子一样，攻击党的文艺政策，否定社会主义文学的成绩，认为党不能领导文艺，并且写出一些污蔑人民、诽谤社会主义制度的作品来了。
    刘绍棠就是这样堕落下去的。这里表现了刘绍棠的狂妄无知，但更重要的还是他的资产阶级个人主义的思想在作祟。我们不应因为他无知，便低估这种思想的危害性。不少文学青年由于缺乏阶级斗争和生产劳动的锻炼，他们虽然是在解放后的新社会里成长起来的，却仍然具有严重的资产阶级个人主义思想，而文艺界的反党分子更在他们中间散布、鼓吹这种思想，使其更加滋长、泛滥。不反掉这种思想，我们的文学事业的发展，就会受到阻碍；文学青年的成长，就会受到损害。广大的青年文艺工作者，应该从刘绍棠的堕落得到深刻的教训，时刻警惕资产阶级个人主义思想的侵蚀。要想在文学创作上有成绩，要想成为一个真正的革命文艺家，必须首先是一个革命的战士；一个党员作家，必须首先是一个好党员。谁要是像刘绍棠那样，把自己放在党和群众的上面，不听党的话，不愿和群众同甘苦、共患难，骄傲自满，目空一切，他就必然会被时代和人民所抛弃。
    刘绍棠的堕落，除了因为他本人有严重的资产阶级个人主义思想之外，也表现了文艺界在对待青年作者的工作上有缺点。不少像刘绍棠这样的青年，才写了一两篇作品，就被调离实际工作岗位，做了专业作家，这样，他们就不但失去了一定的革命组织对他们经常的教育和监督，而且脱离了与人民的联系，失去了创作的源泉。而近年来社会上又出现了一种对青年作家一味捧场的恶劣风气，也助长了他们中间一些人的骄傲自大的情绪。这是一个教训。今后，青年文艺工作者，不应该过早的专业化，应该到工厂、农村或其他基层工作单位中去，担任一定的实际工作，或者直接参加生产劳动，在工农群众的劳动和斗争中锻炼自己，彻底改造自己的非工人阶级的思想和感情，积累生活经验，取得丰富的创作源泉和艺术感受。过早的专业化，对生活经验、创作经验、社会知识等各方面都很贫乏的青年文艺工作者来说，是十分有害的。对青年文艺工作者，应该是培养、鼓励，同时又有严格的要求。有关的党组织和机关、团体，应该加强对青年文艺工作者的政治思想教育，培养他们成为真正的工人阶级的文艺家。
