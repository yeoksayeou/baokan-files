The current membership card of the Soviet Union's Lenin Communist Youth League bears the image of four medals. In March of this year, the Communist Youth League was awarded a fifth medal. These five medals represent the spirit of hard struggle, great achievements, and lofty honors demonstrated by thousands of Soviet Communist Youth League members during each important period of the Communist Youth League's 39 years of existence. These five medals also reflect the glorious path taken by the Soviet Union's Communist Youth League.

	The first medal takes us back to the heroic and legendary youth of the older generation of Communist Youth League members. Forty years ago, youth worker organizations led by Bolsheviks appeared in factories in Leningrad, Moscow, and other places. In October 1918, the All-Russian Communist Youth League was officially established. Young workers and Communist Youth League members fought for the victory of the revolution in the combat days of October, and resolutely defended the Soviet regime during the difficult era of the Civil War.

	During the entire Civil War, the Communist Youth League carried out three All-Russian mobilizations to support the front lines of the Civil War. At that time, the number of Communist Youth League members was small, so sometimes Communist Youth League members from entire regions and entire organizations went to the front lines. "The District Committee is closed because everyone has gone to the front." This was the notice posted on the door of the closed District Committee of the League. This generation of Communist Youth League members forever set an example for later generations of youth by resolutely responding to the Party's call, self-sacrificing, and striving for the victory of the revolutionary cause. Their struggle left the first medal on the membership cards of later generations of Communist Youth League members, symbolizing the "Order of the Red Banner" of the proletarian revolution.

	The great period of economic construction arrived. The Party called on the youth to establish labor achievements. Communist Youth League members participated in the voluntary Saturday movement and launched the shock worker movement for socialist construction. The shock worker movement was first launched in September 1926 at the "Red Triangle" factory in Leningrad, where the first youth shock team was organized. By 1929, the number of youth shock workers nationwide had reached 1.5 million. They braved hunger and cold to repair disrupted transportation and stood in deep water in mine shafts to restore damaged coal mine production.

	The grand program of the Five-Year Plan inspired the socialist labor enthusiasm of Soviet youth to build socialism. "Go to the Five-Year Plan construction site!" The slogan "Complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule" resounded throughout the country. In 1929, the first group of Communist Youth League members came to the construction site. These young people and Communist Youth League members became the backbone of various large enterprises and construction sites. In many factories or enterprises, young people accounted for more than half, or even 70%.

	Young people were building new cities. Komsomolsk-on-Amur is one of these new cities.

	Responding to the Party's call, young people went to collectivized rural areas. Between 1930 and 1934, the Communist Youth League sent 20,000 members to rural areas to work as accountants, 100,000 young people to work as work team scorekeepers, and a large number of young people to work as tractor drivers. Communist Youth League members in rural areas actively participated in cooperatives and became the backbone of the collectivization movement.

	The labor achievements established by Communist Youth League members and young people under the leadership of the Party are great. To reward this achievement, the Communist Youth League was awarded the second medal, the "Order of the Red Banner of Labor," at the Ninth Congress of the Communist Youth League in 1931.

	During the Great Patriotic War, Soviet youth once again selflessly participated in the battle to defend the motherland. Many heroic Communist Youth League members sacrificed their precious lives. People forever recount the immortal deeds of Zoya, Chaikina, Matrosov, and the Young Guard.

	In 1945, the Communist Youth League was awarded the "Order of Lenin." During the Great Patriotic War, another 3.5 million Communist Youth League soldiers received various medals and decorations, and 7,000 Communist Youth League members were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

	After the end of the Great Patriotic War, the glorious Soviet youth immediately rushed to the front lines of economic recovery and the implementation of the first post-war Five-Year Plan. From the winter of 1947 to 1948, 250,000 Communist Youth League members and young people went to work in forest areas, and 48,000 people went to build rural power stations. In 1946, 650,000 young workers completed the annual plan ahead of schedule, in 1947, 2.25 million young workers completed the annual plan ahead of schedule. In 1948, 750,000 young workers completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

	Young people also selflessly repaired cities destroyed by the war. In Stalingrad alone, 25,000 Communist Youth League members participated in reconstruction work. In their spare time, young people volunteered millions of hours to restore famous cities such as Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Kharkov, and Sevastopol.

	The Soviet Party and government highly valued the labor of the Communist Youth League and young people. In 1948, 302 Communist Youth League members were awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. At the Eleventh Congress of the Communist Youth League in 1949, the Communist Youth League was awarded the second "Order of Lenin," which is the fourth medal recorded on the Communist Youth League membership card.

	In the post-war years, Soviet youth in various places launched various forms of production increase and economy movement. Larger-scale construction attracted a wide range of young people.

	In rural areas, the vast number of young people and Communist Youth League members are a powerful force in realizing the Party's agricultural policy. When the Party called for the development of animal husbandry, 250,000 Communist Youth League members immediately went to work on livestock farms. When the Party called for the development of corn production, Communist Youth League members organized 100,000 corn cultivation groups.

	The Party entrusted the great national task of reclaiming wasteland to the most loyal assistants, the Communist Youth League members and Soviet youth. In the spring of 1954, 500,000 young people submitted applications, and more than 100,000 young people immediately packed their bags and came to the vast virgin land. Young patriots wrote: "Soviet young men and women have never aspired to live an easy life. This is how our Party has educated us. We clearly see the great goal ahead and will be tenacious, self-sacrificing, and struggle to achieve this goal."

	In recent years, a total of about 400,000 young men and women have participated in the land reclamation movement, reclaiming a total of 37 million hectares of wasteland. Thousands of young people have set examples and honors in this national cause.

	At the conference of outstanding young people in land reclamation held this spring, the Communist Youth League was awarded the fifth medal: the "Order of Lenin."

	Only sincere labor can make people great and establish merit for the people. Inspired by this belief, Soviet youth are always the vanguard on the labor front. Wherever the Party calls, the youth go there. To the collective farm, to production, to the eastern and northern regions, to the coal mines and power station construction sites, this is the heartfelt wish of Soviet youth.

	As the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution approaches, Soviet youth and Communist Youth League members look back on the glorious path they have traveled. Soviet youth are forever an example to the youth of the world.

    五枚勋章代表的功绩和荣誉
    ——积极参加社会主义和共产主义建设的苏联青年和共青团员
    新华社记者　李楠
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团团员现在的团证上印着四枚勋章的图样。今年3月，共青团又被授予了第五枚勋章。这五枚勋章代表着在共青团成立三十九年来的每个重要时期中苏联千千万万共青团员所表现的艰苦奋斗的精神，他们的伟大的功勋和崇高的荣誉。这五枚勋章也反映出了苏联共青团所走过的光荣的道路。
    第一枚勋章，把我们带到老一代共青团员的英雄的传奇式的青春时代。四十年前，列宁格勒、莫斯科等地的各个工厂出现了布尔什维克领导的青年工人组织。1918年10月全俄共产主义青年团正式成立。青年工人和共青团员们在10月的战斗日子里，争取了革命的胜利，在艰难的内战时代中又坚决地捍卫了苏维埃政权。
    在整个内战时期，共青团员曾经进行了三次全俄动员，支援内战前线。那时，共青团员的人数不多，因此有时整个地区和整个组织的共青团员都上了前线。“区委会关门了，因为所有的人都去了前方。”这是当时贴在关起来的团区委会门前的布告。这一代的共青团员永远地给后代的青年树立了坚决地响应党的号召，自我牺牲、争取革命事业胜利的榜样。他们的奋斗给后代共青团员的证件上留下了第一枚勋章，象征着无产阶级革命的“红旗勋章”。
    经济建设的伟大时期来到了。党号召青年去建立劳动的功绩。共青团员们参加了义务星期六的运动，发起了社会主义建设突击手的运动。突击手运动是1926年9月首先在列宁格勒的“红色三角”工厂发起的，那里组织了第一个青年突击队。到1929年为止，全国青年突击手已经达到了一百五十万人。他们冒着饥寒修复紊乱的交通，站在矿坑深水里恢复破坏了的煤矿生产。
    五年计划的宏伟纲领鼓舞着苏联青年们建设社会主义的劳动热情。“到五年计划工地去！”“提前完成五年计划”的口号响彻全国。1929年，第一批共青团员们来到建设工地。这些青年和共青团员成了各个大企业和工地的骨干，在许多工厂或企业中青年占去了一半以上，甚至占70％。
    青年们在建设着新的城市。阿穆尔河上的共青团城就是这些新城市之一。
    响应着党的号召，青年们到集体化的农村去。在1930年和1934年间，共青团派了两万名团员去农村当会计，十万名青年去当工作队记分员，还派了大批青年去当拖拉机手。农村的共青团员积极参加合作社，成了集体化运动的骨干。
    共青团员和青年们在党的领导下建立的劳动功绩是伟大的。为了奖励这个功绩，在1931年共青团第九次代表大会上获得了第二枚勋章，“劳动红旗勋章”。
    在卫国战争时期，苏联的青年又奋不顾身地参加了保卫祖国的战斗。许多英勇的共青团员牺牲了宝贵的生命。人们永远地传诵着卓娅、蔡金娜、马特洛索夫，以及青年近卫军的不朽的事迹。
    1945年，共青团获得了“列宁勋章”的奖励。在卫国战争期间，还有三百五十万共青团员战士获得了各种勋章和奖章，有七千共青团员获得苏联英雄称号。
    卫国战争结束后，光荣的苏联青年又立刻奔赴恢复经济和执行战后第一个五年计划的战线。1947年冬到1948年，有二十五万共青团员和青年去林区工作，四万八千人去建立农村电力站。1946年有六十五万青年工人提前完成年度计划，1947年有二百二十五万青年工人提前完成年度计划。1948年有七十五万青年工人提前完成五年计划。
    青年们还忘我地修复了被战争破坏的城市。仅仅在斯大林格勒，就有二万五千名共青团员参加重建工作。青年们在工作之余，义务劳动了千万小时来恢复列宁格勒、基辅、明斯克、哈尔科夫、塞瓦斯托波尔等著名的城市。
    苏联党和政府很高地估价共青团和青年们的劳动。1948年有三百零二个共青团员获得社会主义劳动英雄的称号。在1949年共青团第十一次代表大会上，共青团又获得第二枚“列宁勋章”，这是载在共青团团员证上的第四枚勋章。
    战后年代，各地的苏联青年展开了各种形式的增产节约运动。规模更大的建设吸引着广大的青年。
    在农村，广大的青年和共青团员是实现党的农业政策的一支强大力量。党号召发展畜牧业，二十五万共青团员就立即到养畜场去工作。党号召发展玉蜀黍生产，共青团员又组织了十万个栽培玉蜀黍的小组。
    党把开垦荒地的伟大的全民的任务交给最忠实的助手共青团员和苏联青年。1954年春，五十万青年提出了申请书，十万多青年立刻收拾行装，来到了辽阔的处女地。青年爱国者们这样写着：“苏联青年男女从来没有想望过过轻松的生活。我们的党就是这样教育我们的。我们清楚地看见前面的伟大目标，将坚韧不拔，自我牺牲，为实现这一目标而斗争。”
    在最近这几年内共有约四十万青年男女参加了开荒运动，一共开垦了三千七百万公顷的荒地。成千上万的青年在这一全民的事业中树立了榜样和荣誉。
    在今年春天所举行的开垦荒地的优秀青年大会上，共青团获得了第五枚勋章：“列宁勋章”。
    只有真诚的劳动才能使人伟大，才能为人民建立功绩。被这一信念所鼓舞着的苏联青年永远是劳动战线上的先锋。党号召到那里，青年就走向那里。到农庄中去，到生产中去，到东部和北部地区，到煤矿和电力站工地去，这是苏联青年的衷心的愿望。
    在十月革命四十周年降临的时候，苏联青年和共青团员回顾着所走过的光荣的道路。苏联青年永远是世界青年的榜样。　　（据新华社莫斯科25日电）
