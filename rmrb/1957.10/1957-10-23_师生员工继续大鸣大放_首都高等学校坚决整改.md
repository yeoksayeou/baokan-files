Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: Beijing Many university and college Party committees and administrative leaders, because they have worked hard to improve their work, the big-character posters in the schools are increasing day by day. In the week or so up to the 18th, teachers, students, and staff in twenty-two schools posted more than 9,000 big-character posters. Together with the opinions raised at the symposiums, a total of more than 30,000 opinions were put forward. The detailed handling of the criticisms and opinions raised by the masses since the rectification campaign, as announced by the Party committees and school administrative units, attracted many viewers. After the Tsinghua University Party Committee posted the handling of issues related to political and ideological education on the wall on the 18th, there were often more than 100 onlookers. On the same day, the Geological Exploration Institute posted a big-character poster announcing that the Party Committee accepted the opinions of the cadres and other students of the Coalfield Teaching and Research Section, and held an expanded meeting of the Party Committee to criticize a Party member leading cadre's work style, which also attracted many viewers.

In the big-character posters of various schools, many opinions were put forward regarding teaching and scientific research work. In some schools, it accounted for about 30%, and in some schools, it reached about 40%. The requirement of running schools thriftily is also a relatively common theme in the big-character posters. Many other big-character posters contained opinions on administrative management, welfare, etc., criticisms of cadre style, and replies from relevant departments of the school to newly raised criticisms.

The Party committees and administrative leaders of various schools, as well as the staff of the rectification offices, are working intensively to quickly handle the criticisms and opinions raised by the masses. Those that can be changed are changed immediately, and those that cannot be resolved for the time being, or those whose opinions are incorrect, are also answered one by one. Many problems that can be solved are solved soon after the big-character posters are posted. A big-character poster at the University of International Trade criticized the clinic for often not having a doctor during working hours and no one on duty on Sundays. It was resolved the day after it was posted.

In addition to mobilizing the masses to post big-character posters, many school Party committees also held forums and individual talks to mobilize teachers to offer opinions. At a forum in the Geography Department of Beijing Normal University, teachers raised more than 60 opinions in two hours.

    师生员工继续大鸣大放
    首都高等学校坚决整改
    本报特约新华社专稿　北京许多高等学校的党委和行政领导，由于狠狠地改进工作，学校里的大字报正在与日俱增。到18日止的一个多星期里，已有二十二个学校的师生员工贴出九千多份大字报，连同座谈会上提的意见，共提出了三万多条意见。对党委和学校行政单位公布的整风以来群众所提批评和意见的逐条处理情况，观众很多。清华大学党委会18日在墙壁上贴出了对于有关政治思想教育方面问题的处理情况后，围观者经常有一百多人。同一天地质勘探学院贴出一张大字报，公布了党委会接受煤田教研室的干部和其他学生的意见，召开党委扩大会议批判一个党员领导干部工作作风的消息，也吸引了很多观众。
    在各个学校的大字报上，对于教学和科学研究工作，提了很多意见。有的学校占30％，有的学校达40％左右。要求勤俭办学校，也是大字报里比较多的一个内容。其他许多大字报，有的是对行政管理、生活福利等提出的意见，有的是对干部作风提出批评，也有的是学校的有关部门对新提出的批评的答复。
    各个学校的党委和行政领导，以及整改办公室的工作人员，正在紧张地工作，迅速处理群众提出的批评和意见。凡是能够改的马上改，对一时不能解决的、或者意见本身是不正确的，也做到条条有答复。有许多能够解决的问题，在大字报刚贴出不久，马上就得到解决。对外贸易学院有一张大字报，批评医务室在工作时间里往往没有医生，星期天没有值班的人，贴出以后，第二天就解决了。
    除了发动群众贴大字报外，许多学校党委还召开座谈会和进行个别谈话，发动教师提意见。北京师范大学地理系的座谈会，在两小时内，教师们就提了六十多条意见。
