Damascus Correspondence

    At the Chinese Handicraft Exhibition
    Cheng Liangping

    Since the Chinese Arts and Crafts Exhibition opened in Damascus on September 1, it has been warmly welcomed and praised by Syrian audiences. By the 12th, the number of visitors had exceeded 100,000. The highest number was on Friday of last week (September 6, Muslim's Juma day), with about 20,000 visitors.

    China did not formally participate in the 4th Damascus International Fair this year, but this exhibition held by the Chinese government at the invitation of the Syrian side during the fair did play a role in promoting economic and cultural exchanges between China and Syria and strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Arab peoples.

    The Arab people have given a very high evaluation of the Chinese people's arts and crafts. Every time I walked into the exhibition hall, I noticed people were attentively admiring the Chinese exhibits. Some of them liked to express their approval in the Chinese way of nodding, and some of them kept chanting praises; but the vast majority of Arabs praised it in their unique way, first placing their index finger in front of their mouths, closing their eyes, and making a "hush" sound. The Arabs who love Chinese people's art lined up in long queues, vying to inscribe messages in the Chinese pavilion's guestbook as a memento. According to the staff in the pavilion, the number of people who inscribed messages in the guestbook in the past twelve days has exceeded 1,600.

    Among the more than 2,000 Chinese arts and crafts exhibits, woodcuts, ivory carvings, and pottery were the most popular. After seeing China's woodcuts and ivory carvings, many people couldn't believe they were made from a single piece of material. Walid Khayata, a famous Syrian artist and sculptor, wrote in the guestbook after visiting the Chinese exhibition hall: "I have visited many exhibition halls in the past, but I have never seen such excellent handicrafts as in the Chinese pavilion, especially the woodcuts." Another Syrian who loves woodcut art, Khanm Sal, wrote: "The exhibits in the Chinese pavilion show that Chinese woodcut art has reached its peak." Arab women are particularly fond of Chinese embroidery and brocade. Groups of Arab women can often be seen lingering beside these exhibits.

    In order to meet the needs of the Arab people for Chinese handicrafts, a small shop was set up in the pavilion to sell a small portion of Chinese handicrafts. Since its opening, the shop has been very prosperous, and the counter has always been crowded with dense crowds.

    The Arab people not only gave a very high evaluation of Chinese arts and crafts, but also expressed their lofty wishes for enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Arab peoples through the exhibition. Many people expressed their sincere gratitude for the Chinese people's support for the Egyptian people during the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt and recently for the Syrian people's struggle. In his inscription in the guestbook, Syrian Minister of State and Minister of Defense Azm, in addition to praising the artistic level of the Chinese people, also wrote: "I will never forget the Chinese people's position on Arab issues." An anonymous Syrian enthusiastically wrote: "Every exhibit in the Chinese pavilion is very beautiful, but the most beautiful thing is the Chinese people's friendship with the Syrian people. ... The Chinese people are our true friends, defenders of peace, destroyers of imperialist fortresses, and victors in building socialism."

    Imperialism always likes to carry out various kinds of slanderous propaganda against the new China. Some people who did not know much about China in the past have indeed been fooled by their deceptive propaganda, but paper cannot contain fire. Even the Arab people of some countries that have not yet established diplomatic relations with us are now increasingly aware that the Chinese people love peace and art. Abdullah Shabi, who came to the Chinese pavilion from Kuwait, wrote in the guestbook: "Imperialism has deceived us. After seeing the Chinese pavilion, I found that Chinese civilization is far better than we imagined." Another Lebanese lawyer wrote: "It is difficult to express my feelings for Chinese arts and crafts in words. China is an ancient civilization, a supporter of world peace, and a true friend of the people who are fighting for independence and freedom."

    Through this exhibition, the Arab people have not only strengthened their love for the Chinese people, but many people have also expressed their desire to strengthen mutual learning with the Chinese people. Jack Walda, vice chairman of the Syrian Fine Arts and Sculpture Association, said: "I hope to have the opportunity to go to China in the future to see the production of these artworks with my own eyes. May our future cooperation and mutual learning be closer than in the past." Another anonymous Syrian wrote: "I am very happy after seeing the Chinese pavilion. I hope that God will give me a good opportunity to go to China once."

### 在中国手工艺品展览会上

    在中国手工艺品展览会上
    程良平
    中国美术工艺品展览会自9月1日起在大马士革展出以后，受到了叙利亚观众的热烈欢迎和赞许。到12日为止，参观展览的人数已经超过了十万人次以上。最多的一次是上星期五（9月6日，穆斯林的主麻日），观众达二万人次左右。
    中国今年没有正式参加第四届大马士革国际博览会，但是中国政府应叙利亚有关方面的邀请在博览会期间所举行的这个展览会，的确起了促进中叙两国之间经济和文化交流、加强中国人民和阿拉伯人民之间的友谊的作用。
    阿拉伯人民对于中国人民的美术工艺品给予很高的评价。当我每次走进展览馆的时候，我注意到人们都在聚精会神地欣赏中国展览品。他们中间，有的人喜欢以中国人习惯的点头方式表示赞许，有的人嘴里总是念念有词地赞不绝口；但是绝大多数的阿拉伯人都以他们特有的方式先将食指放在嘴前，两眼一闭，“嘘”的一声表示称赞。热爱中国人民艺术的阿拉伯人排起长长的行列，争着要为中国馆题词留作纪念。据馆内工作人员告诉我说，十二天来，在留言簿上题词的人数已经超过了一千六百人左右。
    在二千多件中国美术工艺品的展品中，最受欢迎的要算木刻、象牙雕刻和陶器了。很多人看了我国的木刻和象牙雕刻作品后，都不敢相信它是一块整材料作成的。叙利亚著名的美术家和雕刻家瓦里尔·克哈雅德在看了中国展览馆后在留言簿上写道：“我过去参观过不少展览馆，还未曾看到过像中国馆这样优秀的手工艺品，特别是木刻。”另一位喜爱木刻艺术的叙利亚人克汗姆·萨尔写道：“中国馆的展品表明，中国的木刻艺术已经达到了登峰造极的地步。”阿拉伯的妇女们对于中国的刺绣和织锦特别喜爱。在这些展品的旁边，经常可以看到三五成群的阿拉伯妇女留连不去。
    为了满足阿拉伯人民对于中国手工业品的需要，在馆内设立了一个小卖铺，出售很小一部分中国手工业品。这个小卖铺自开张以来，生意非常兴隆，柜台面前总是挤满着密密层层的人群。
    阿拉伯人不仅仅对于中国美术工艺品给予很高的评价，而且通过展览会对于增进中国人民和阿拉伯人民之间的友谊表示了崇高的愿望，许多人对于中国人民在英法侵略埃及期间对埃及人民以及最近对叙利亚人民的斗争的支持表示衷心的感谢。叙利亚国务部长兼国防部长阿泽姆在留言簿上的题词中，除了赞扬中国人民的艺术水平以外，还写道：“我决不会忘记中国人民对于阿拉伯问题的立场。”一位没有署名的叙利亚人热情地写道：“中国馆的每件展品都是非常美丽的，但是最美丽的是中国人民对叙利亚人民的友谊。……中国人民是我们真正的朋友，和平的保卫者，帝国主义堡垒的摧毁者和建设社会主义的胜利者。”
    帝国主义总是喜欢对新中国进行各种各样的诬蔑宣传，有些过去对于中国不太了解的人的确上过他们欺骗宣传的当，但是纸是包不住火的，即使是现在尚未和我们建交的一些国家的阿拉伯人民，现在也越来越认识到中国人民是热爱和平和热爱艺术的。从科威特来中国馆参观的阿卜杜拉·沙毕在留言簿上写道：“帝国主义欺骗了我们。看了中国馆以后，我发现中国的文明远比我们想像的好得多。”另一位黎巴嫩律师写道：“用语言很难表达我对中国美术工艺品的感情。中国是一个文明古国，维护世界和平的支持者和为争取独立和自由而斗争的人民的真正朋友。”
    通过这次展出，阿拉伯人民不仅加强了他们对于中国人民的热爱，许多人还表示要加强同中国人民相互学习的愿望。叙利亚美术雕刻家协会副主席杰克·瓦尔达说：“我很希望今后有机会能到中国去亲眼看一看这些美术品的制作。愿我们今后的合作和相互学习比过去更加密切起来。”另一位没有署名的叙利亚人写道：“看了中国馆后，我非常高兴。但愿天赐良机，能让我也有机会到中国去一次。”
