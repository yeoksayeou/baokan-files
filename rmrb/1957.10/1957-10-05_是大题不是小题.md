    It's a Big Issue, Not a Small One
    Shí Jiān
    One of the poisonous arrows with which the right-wingers are madly attacking us is to slander our Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement, saying that the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement is "making a big fuss over a minor issue," and that the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement is "full of errors and deviations."
    The fact that the right-wingers want to dwell on this topic shows that it is a big issue. Because the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement is an important measure to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and because the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement powerfully guarantees socialist construction.
    The facts are just like that. The "Exhibition of Criminal Evidence of Counter-Revolutionaries and Other Criminals" recently held by the Ministry of Public Security illustrates this point.
    This exhibition tells us that from July 1955 to the present, more than 88,100 counter-revolutionaries and bad elements have been identified in government agencies, the military, schools, and organizations. Is this a small issue?
    "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," "Committee for the Suppression of Communists," "Tianmen Dao," "Assassination Squad"... various counter-revolutionary organizations, American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's secret service agencies, dispatched secret agents and spies batch after batch from the sky, land, and sea, sneaking into the mainland, stealing intelligence, and sabotaging construction... is this a "small issue"?
    Zhuang Shimin, a counter-revolutionary element lurking in the Qitai Health Center in Xinjiang, holding a kitchen knife, broke into the ward and successively hacked to death and wounded more than a dozen hospitalized patients, including Liu Dianying, Deputy Director of the Agricultural Department, and even pregnant women and relatives visiting patients were not spared. Is this a "small issue"?
    Yang Jinxing, a murdering executioner, a "Military Statistics Bureau" agent, and the chief warden of the Baigongguan prison of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," participated in and personally murdered Luo Shiwen, the person in charge of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Che Yaoxian of the Western Sichuan Special Committee, and General Yang Hucheng and more than 300 other revolutionary martyrs. Is this a "small issue"?
    The bloody facts show that the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement is not a "small issue," but a big issue, a major issue concerning the life and death of the country. If it is a "big issue," it should be handled on a large scale. Only in this way is it appropriate and realistic.
    Judging from this exhibition, there are errors and deviations in the handling of some cases. However, there is a fundamental difference from the "errors and deviations" clamored by the right-wingers. The errors and deviations mentioned here are that some cases are making a big issue out of a small matter. For example, as People's Daily readers have already pointed out, the Anshan City and Lanzhou City Intermediate People's Courts only sentenced Luo Jikui and Lu Binglin, the culprits who massacred Chen Tanqiu, Mao Zemin, and more than 250 other revolutionary martyrs, to 20 years in prison. Another example is Yang Zhaoyu, the leader of the "Assassination Squad," who personally killed as many as eight revolutionary cadres and progressive people. This vicious counter-revolutionary grabbed Wang Waiwai, a member of our Farmers' Association, and hacked him to death with a saber... and was only sentenced to ten years of imprisonment.
    These counter-revolutionary elements, with their hands full of blood and countless lives owed, deserved more than death. However, some people with right-leaning thoughts in the People's Courts were "light! Heavy! One year! Two years!" when sentencing these culprits and murderers. Perhaps they thought they were grasping the policy and weighing the pros and cons, but they forgot that our policy is a tool for the people to exercise dictatorship over the enemies of the revolution. They forgot that this is a major issue of right and wrong. In the face of such a major issue of right and wrong, "kindness" to the enemy is cruelty to the people.

    是大题不是小题
    石坚
    右派分子向我们疯狂进攻的毒箭之一，是诬蔑我们的肃反运动，说什么肃反运动是“小题大作”，说什么肃反运动中“尽是错误和偏差”。
    右派分子要按住这个题目来作“文章”，正说明了这是个大题。因为肃反运动是巩固人民民主专政的重要措施，因为肃反运动有力地保证了社会主义建设。
    事实就是如此，最近公安部举办的“反革命分子及其他刑事犯罪分子罪证展览会”，就说明了这个问题。
    这个展览会告诉我们，仅从1955年7月到现在，从机关、部队、学校和团体中，就清查出了八万八千一百多名反革命分子和坏分子。这是小题吗？
    “反共救国军”“剿共委员会”“天门道”“暗杀团”……种种反革命组织，美帝国主义者和蒋介石特务机关，从天空、陆地、海上，一批又一批的派遣特务间谍分子，潜入大陆，盗取情报，破坏建设……，这是“小题”吗？
    潜伏在新疆奇台卫生院的反革命分子庄世民，手持菜刀，闯入病房，一连砍死砍伤我住院病人农业厅副厅长刘殿英同志等十多人，连孕妇和探病人的亲属都未能幸免，这是“小题”吗？
    杀人的刽子手，“军统”特务，“中美合作所”白公馆看守长杨进兴，曾参与和亲手杀害过中共四川省委负责人罗世文，川西特委车耀先，以及杨虎城将军和其他三百多位革命志士，这是“小题”吗？
    鲜血淋漓的事实，说明了肃反运动不是个“小题”，而是个大题，是关系着国家生死存亡的大题。是“大题”就应大作。只有这样，才是恰如其分、实事求是。
    从这个展览会来看，有些案件处理上是有错误和偏差，不过，与右派分子所叫嚣的“错误和偏差”，是有根本区别的。这里所说的错误和偏差是有些案子大题小作了。例如人民日报读者已经提出的鞍山市和兰州市中级人民法院，对残杀陈潭秋、毛泽民等二百五十多位革命志士的罪魁罗继奎、卢秉林，只判处了二十年徒刑。又如“暗杀团”组长杨兆玉，曾亲手杀死革命干部和进步群众就有八人之多，这个凶恶的反革命，将我农会委员王歪歪抓住，用马刀活活劈死……也只判处了有期徒刑十年。
    这些满手鲜血、命债如山的反革命分子，本来死有余罪，而人民法院中某些具有右倾思想的人，在对这些罪魁、凶手进行判处时，却在“轻呀！重呀！一年呀！两年呀！”上面打算盘，也许，他们自以为是在掌握政策，权衡利弊，但他们却忘记了，我们的政策，是人民对革命的敌人实行专政的工具，忘记了这是大是大非，在这样大是大非面前，对敌人“仁慈”的后果，是对人民的残忍。
