    Always Maintain a Learning Attitude
    Guo Moruo
    The great October Revolution marked a new era in human history, paving the way for the liberation of all mankind. This festival is the common festival of working people all over the world. All of us in China are joyfully welcoming this great festival.
    The Chinese revolution followed the path of the October Socialist Revolution. It took the Chinese people many twists and turns to embark on this path. For nearly a century, the Chinese people have endured hardships, shed blood and sacrificed, in an effort to find a way to liberate themselves from the oppression of colonialism, feudalism, and later, bureaucratic capitalism. However, the peasant revolutions of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Yihetuan failed, and the Xinhai Revolution also failed. It was not until the salvo of the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to the suffering Chinese people that we were shown the broad road to freedom and happiness. It was precisely along this path, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the sympathy and assistance of the Soviet people, that we overcame countless unimaginable difficulties and obstacles and finally achieved the victory of the revolution.
    In the eight years under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, our socialist construction has been fruitful. Through the Three Great Transformations and the Five Great Movements, we have already transformed the private ownership of the means of production into socialist public ownership on the economic foundation; our first Five-Year Plan is definitely going to be overfulfilled this year. The tremendous achievements made in these short years are inseparable from the comprehensive and selfless assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and inseparable from our learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The Chinese people will always express their deep gratitude to the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people.
    The fraternal friendship between the people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, is unbreakable; we have the common thought of Marxism-Leninism, and we have common goals of struggle. Therefore, our friendship and unity can withstand the test of any storm. After the Hungarian incident last year, imperialist elements gleefully launched an anti-Soviet and anti-communist wave worldwide, attempting to split the unity among socialist countries. However, the imperialists' conspiracy did not succeed. The friendship between our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, and the unity of the entire socialist camp have instead become more consolidated. This year, a small number of bourgeois rightists in our country took advantage of the Chinese Communist Party's rectification campaign to stir up and alienate the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, conspiring to make China deviate from the socialist path. The people of the whole country have ruthlessly crushed their shameless attempts.
    We, the Chinese people, feel honored and proud to be faithful friends of the Soviet people.
    As faithful friends of the Soviet people, we Chinese people have always maintained a learning attitude and closely watched the great communist construction being carried out by the Soviet people. Every progress made by the Soviet people in completing this historical task makes us feel joyful and inspired. Every brilliant achievement made by the Soviet people is our own example.
    We are very happy to see that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has issued slogans to celebrate the October Revolution. The eighty-one slogans show the indicators of the comprehensive construction of Soviet communism and also show the high level that Soviet construction has already reached. We know that in the era of Soviet power, in just forty years, in some aspects of Soviet industry alone: industrial products have increased 29 times, machine manufacturing and metal processing industry production has increased 179 times, and electricity production has increased nearly 99 times. Due to the rapid development of industry and the continuous improvement of labor productivity, there is a possibility of changing to a seven-hour workday or a six-hour workday in the near future.
    We are very happy to see that the Soviet government has taken many significant measures in the past year or so based on the will of the entire Soviet people. For example, shifting the focus of industrial management to local areas will not only more quickly improve the material welfare of the people, but also more quickly promote the universal prosperity of culture. Economic centers in various places will soon become cultural centers. Taking the Novosibirsk Ballet Theater, which is currently visiting China, as an example, their performance level is comparable to that of Moscow and Leningrad. Novosibirsk was a desolate exile area in the Tsarist era, but under Soviet power, today it is not only an important economic city, but also a highly cultural city. This eloquently illustrates that the various new measures taken by the Soviet government will surely bring brilliant new results.
    We are very happy to see the astonishing development of Soviet science and technology. The Soviet Union was the first country to use atomic energy in industry, established the world's first atomic power station, and built a 10 billion electron volt microparticle accelerator. We have also heard that the first Soviet icebreaker equipped with an atomic generator will begin sailing this year and can sail for two or three years without having to enter a port to add fuel. We have also heard that the Soviet Union is designing a 50 billion electron volt microparticle accelerator.
    What excites us especially is the recent successful launch of the first artificial earth satellite by the Soviet Union. This huge scientific achievement, like the successfully launched intercontinental ballistic missile not long ago, once again undeniably demonstrates the advancement of Soviet science and technology, and demonstrates the strength of the forces of peace centered on the Soviet Union. Due to this great achievement of the Soviet Union, a new era has arrived in the history of human culture. Scientists say: This is the era when mankind began to change from terrestrial creatures to cosmic creatures, the era when mankind began to conquer interstellar space. We, the Chinese people, together with the Soviet people and peace-loving people all over the world, hail the arrival of this new era.
    We are very happy to see that the Soviet Union's unwavering peace policy is increasingly uniting all peace-loving countries and people in the world. Although the Soviet Union stands at the forefront of the world in the manufacture of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and intercontinental missiles, it has always advocated banning the use of such weapons and advocated universal disarmament, even to the point of leaving only the police force.
    Since the Soviet government issued the declaration on the basis of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in October last year, the unity among fraternal socialist countries has been further strengthened through a series of visits and talks between leaders. The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Asian and African countries such as India, Myanmar, Indonesia, Ceylon, Cambodia, Egypt, and Syria are also developing and strengthening day by day. We have also noted that the Soviet Union has played and is playing a huge role in preventing imperialist aggression against Egypt and Syria. We, the 600 million Chinese people, fully support every effort made by the Soviet Union to promote world peace and ease international tensions, and peace-loving people all over the world are increasingly expressing their warm support. We believe that imperialist warmongers should be completely sober today and seriously consider and accept the Soviet Union's peace proposals.
    The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. The Soviet Union's brilliant achievements have given us great encouragement and increased our confidence and strength in building socialism. We must learn from the Soviet people, hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely follow the socialist path, and promote the construction of the motherland.
    We, the Chinese people, are also deeply aware that continuing to consolidate and strengthen the unity and friendship between us and the Soviet people is our highest international obligation and an important guarantee for maintaining world peace and developing the cause of human progress. We must also protect the unity and friendship between us and the Soviet people like protecting our own eyes, in order to strive for the complete victory of our common cause!

    始终怀抱着学习的心情
    郭沫若
    伟大的十月革命是人类历史的新纪元，它为全人类开辟出了一条解放的道路。这个节日是全世界劳动人民的共同节日。我们全中国人民正欢欣鼓舞地迎接着这个伟大节日。
    中国革命走的是十月社会主义革命的道路。我们中国人民是费了多少周折才走上这条道路的。近百年来，中国人民曾经历尽艰苦，流血牺牲，想要找到一条从殖民主义、封建主义和后来的官僚资本主义压迫下解放出来的道路。但是，太平天国和义和团的农民革命是失败了，辛亥革命也同样是失败了，直到十月革命的一声炮响，给多灾多难的中国人民送来了马克思列宁主义，才给我们指出了走向自由和幸福的康庄大道。我们正是沿着这条道路，在中国共产党的领导下，在苏联人民的同情和援助下，克服了无数难以想像的困难和障碍，终于取得了革命的胜利。
    八年来在党和政府的正确领导下，我们的社会主义建设事业是有成就的。经过了三大改造和五大运动，我们在经济基础上已经把生产资料私有制改变为社会主义公有制；我们的第一个五年计划今年已经肯定可以超额完成了。在这短短的几年中取得了这样巨大的成就，是和我们伟大的盟邦苏联的全面无私的援助分不开的，是和我们学习苏联的先进经验分不开的。中国人民对于苏联人民的伟大的国际主义精神，将永远表示深切的感谢。
    我们中苏两国人民之间的兄弟友谊是牢不可破的；我们有着马克思列宁主义的共同思想，我们有着共同的奋斗目标。因此，我们的友谊和团结是经得住任何风浪的考验的。去年匈牙利事件发生以后，帝国主义分子曾经兴高采烈地在世界范围内掀起了反苏反共的浪潮，企图分裂各社会主义国家间的团结。但是，帝国主义者的阴谋没有得逞。我们中苏两国的友谊和整个社会主义阵营的团结反而是更加巩固了。今年，我们国内的少数资产阶级右派分子利用中国共产党整风的机会，乘机挑拨和离间中苏两国的友好关系，阴谋使中国脱离社会主义的道路。全国人民已毫不容情地粉碎了他们的无耻企图。
    我们中国人民以能够作为苏联人民的忠实的朋友而感到光荣和骄傲。
    作为苏联人民的忠实的朋友，我们中国人民始终是怀抱着学习的心情，密切地注意着苏联人民所进行着的伟大的共产主义建设事业的。苏联人民在完成这个历史任务中所取得的每一项进展，都使我们感到欢欣鼓舞。苏联人民所取得的每一项有光辉的成就，就是我们自己的榜样。
    我们十分高兴地看到：苏联共产党中央发布了庆祝十月革命节的口号。在那八十一项口号中表示出了苏联共产主义全面建设的指标，也表示出了苏联建设事业所已经达到的高度的水平。我们知道，在苏维埃政权的年代里，仅仅四十年间，单就苏联工业的一些方面来说：工业产品已经提高了二十九倍，机器制造和金属加工业生产增加了一百七十九倍，电力生产提高了将近九十九倍。由于工业的迅速发展，劳动生产率的不断的提高，在最近的将来竟有改为七小时工作日，或六小时工作日的可能了。
    我们十分高兴地看到，苏联政府根据苏联全体人民的意志，在最近一年多来采取了许多意义重大的措施。例如把管理工业的重心转移到地方，这不仅将更快地提高人民的物质福利，而且会更快地促进文化的普遍繁荣。各地的经济中心将很快地成为文化中心。拿目前正在中国访问中的新西伯利亚芭蕾舞剧院为例，他们的演出水平和莫斯科、列宁格勒的演出不相上下。新西伯利亚在沙皇时代是荒寒的流放地区，然而在苏维埃政权下，在今天不仅是重要的经济都市，而且已经成为高度的文化都市了。这就很雄辩地说明了，苏联政府所采取的各项新措施必将带来光辉的新成果。
    我们十分高兴地看到：苏联的科学技术的惊人的发展。苏联是第一个在工业上利用原子能的国家，建立了世界上第一个原子能发电站，建立了一百亿电子伏特的微粒子加速器。我们还听说，苏联第一艘装备原子能发电机的破冰船将于今年开始航行，可以航行两三年间不必开进港口添加燃料。我们也听说，苏联正在设计五百亿电子伏特的微粒子加速器。
    尤其使我们感到兴奋的是苏联最近成功地发射了第一个人造地球卫星。这一巨大的科学成就，和不久以前发射成功的洲际弹道火箭一样，再一次无可争辩地表明了苏联科学技术的先进性，表明了以苏联为中心的和平力量的强大。由于苏联这一伟大的成就，在人类文化史中一个新的时代降临了。科学家们说：这是人类开始从地球生物变为宇宙生物的时代，是人类开始征服星际空间的时代。我们中国人民和苏联人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民一道，欢呼这个新时代的来临。
    我们十分高兴地看到：苏联的坚定不移的和平政策正在愈来愈广泛地团结着世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民。苏联在原子武器、氢武器和洲际导弹等的制造方面尽管站在世界最前列，然而始终主张禁止这种武器的使用，并主张普遍裁军，甚至于可以裁到仅留下民警的地步。
    自从去年10月间苏联政府发表了关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言以来，通过领导人之间的一系列的访问和会谈，已经更进一步加强了各社会主义兄弟国家之间的团结。苏联和印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、锡兰、柬埔寨、埃及、叙利亚等亚非国家间的友好关系也正在日益发展和加强。我们还注意到，苏联在制止帝国主义对埃及和叙利亚的侵略中已经起了而且正在起着巨大的作用。苏联为了促进世界和平、缓和国际紧张局势所作的每一项努力，我们六亿中国人民是全力支持的，全世界爱好和平的人民也愈来愈广泛地表示着热烈的拥护。我们认为帝国主义好战分子们在今天是应该彻底清醒起来，对苏联的各项和平建议认真考虑并加以接受的时候了。
    苏联的今天就是我们的明天。苏联的光辉成就给与了我们以莫大的鼓舞，使我们增加了建设社会主义的信心和力量。我们一定要向苏联人民看齐，在中国共产党的领导下更高地举起马克思列宁主义的旗帜，坚决地走社会主义的道路，来促进祖国的建设事业。
    我们中国人民同样深切地认识到：继续巩固和加强我们与苏联人民之间的团结和友谊，是我们最高的国际义务，是维护世界和平和发展人类进步事业的重要保证。我们也一定要像保护自己的眼珠一样保护我们和苏联人民之间的团结和友谊，以争取我们共同事业的彻底胜利！
