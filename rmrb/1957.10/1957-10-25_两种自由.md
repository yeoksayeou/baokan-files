    Two Kinds of Freedom
    Ge De

    Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in his report at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party:

    "In rural areas, there are some bad elements who 'do not violate major laws but often violate minor ones.' If these people were to be handled by local courts, it would be overwhelming, but not dealing with them would greatly hinder production and social order. We can consider having the members' representative assembly or the township people's congress formulate practical and feasible covenants, which would be approved by the higher-level government, to constrain them, and establish mediation committees responsible for the implementation of the covenants. Those who violate these covenants can be authorized to be given appropriate punishments by cooperatives or township governments. ... Not only in rural areas, but also in cities, factories, mines, organs, and schools, can this be tried out."

      "In order to limit the development of cooperative members towards capitalism, there should be appropriate restrictions on the scope of private plots, individual land reclamation, individual sideline business, and rural free market activities. For individual households, the township government or the cooperative entrusted by the township government should effectively manage them, and not allow them to have the 'freedom' to engage in capitalist activities and undermine the cooperatives. Their illegal and harmful activities... must be restricted or stopped. When urban enterprises and institutions recruit workers and temporary workers in rural areas, they should go through the cooperative introduction, or sign contracts with the cooperative, and are not allowed to freely recruit cooperative members and individual farmers."

    Such and such "restrictions" will probably cause those with a "freedom" fetish to make a lot of noise. In fact, this kind of discussion has long existed. For example, some people say that "socialist countries are collectivist, with only collective democracy and freedom, and no individual democracy and freedom; capitalist countries are individualistic, with individual democracy and freedom. Therefore, socialist democracy and freedom should be supplemented by bourgeois democracy and freedom." It is said that some people in the new society feel unfree all over and think of "becoming a monk" (he even feels unfree to sit in the office every day), but he did not go to "become a monk" after all, it is said because even some "monks" now have to participate in the "People's Congress" and "CPPCC," and there is still the lack of "freedom" to attend meetings. How can people who love "freedom" so much tolerate such and such "restrictions"? But the vast majority of people welcome these "restrictions" because they are necessary conditions for guaranteeing the reasonable and legitimate freedom of the vast majority of people.

    In fact, the statement that "socialist countries only have collective freedom and no individual freedom" is also a pure misinterpretation or slander. The correct statement should be: in socialist countries, only individual freedom that conforms to collective interests is allowed (collectives are always formed by individuals, and where there is collective freedom, there is individual freedom of collective members), and freedom that opposes or undermines collective interests is not allowed. And the kind of "freedom" that some people want to use to "supplement" the socialist system is precisely the freedom to destroy collective interests that we are talking about. The purpose of "supplementing" is only to legalize it, thereby depriving people of the freedom to oppose this kind of "freedom."

    Isn't the kind of "freedom" that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report wants to oppose precisely the "freedom" that destroys the socialist system and harms the normal life interests of the people? Doesn't the "law" of "not violating major laws but often violating minor ones" that he pointed out refer precisely to collective interests and the normal living interests of the people? In addition to the various phenomena of "not violating major laws but often violating minor ones" in rural areas, we have also seen some so-called "not making big mistakes but constantly making small mistakes" (such as disrupting public order, damaging public property, morally corrupt words and deeds, and violating labor discipline) characters in the city, tilting their heads, glaring with triangular eyes, and shouting at those who oppose them: "It's none of your business, this is my freedom." If this kind of person is given this kind of "freedom," it will make more people lose the freedom to oppose their "freedom." And "covenants" and "committees" are precisely to guarantee people's freedom. If the people don't even have the freedom to oppose freedom that hinders the freedom of the people, then can it still be considered the people's world?

    However, these "free" people are only committing "minor laws" and "minor mistakes," so there is no need to send them to court for legal action; therefore, "a mass self-education, self-supervision, and self-restraint method" and "an important method of socialist restriction of individualism, changing old customs and habits, and forming new customs and habits" are used to solve the problem. The constant commission of "minor laws" and "minor mistakes" is based on both "individualism" and "force of habit"; moreover, if the "small" is not changed, it will inevitably develop into the "big." Using the collective power to help remove "minor mistakes" and avoid them from becoming enemies of the people due to evolving into "major mistakes," directly reaching the point of disgrace and ruin, wouldn't it also be a great good deed with immeasurable merit?

    两种自由
    葛德
    邓小平同志在党的八届三中全会上所作的报告中说：
    “各地农村中都有一些‘大法不犯、小法常犯’的不良分子。对于这些人，如果由地方法院处理就不胜其烦，但是不加处理，对于生产秩序和社会秩序又有很大妨害。可以考虑由社员代表大会或者乡人民代表大会定出切实可行的公约，由上一级政府批准，加以约束，并建立调处委员会负责公约的执行。违反这些公约的，可以授权合作社或者乡政府给以适当处罚。……不但在农村中，而且在城市中，在厂矿机关学校中，都可以试行。”
      “为了限制合作社社员向资本主义方向发展，对于自留地、个人开荒、个人经营副业和农村自由市场活动的范围，要有适当限制。对于单干户，要由乡政府或由乡政府委托合作社切实管起来，不让他们有进行资本主义活动和破坏合作社的‘自由’。对他们的违法行为和有害活动，……必须加以限制或制止。城市的企业和机关要在农村招收工人和临时工的时候，应该经过合作社介绍，或者同合作社订合同，不许自由录用合作社员和单干农民”。
    这样那样的“限制”，大概会引起有着“自由”癖的人们大发议论的。其实这种议论也早就有了。比如有人说“社会主义国家是集体主义的，只有集体的民主和自由，没有个人的民主和自由；资本主义国家是个人主义的，有个人的民主和自由。因此，应该由资产阶级的民主和自由来补充社会主义的民主和自由”。据说有人在新社会感到浑身不自由而想到“出家”（他竟感到每天上班坐办公室也不自由），但他毕竟没有去“出家”，据说这是因为现在连有些“出家人”也要参加“人大”“政协”，也还有开会的不“自由”的。这样热爱“自由”的人，怎能看得惯这样那样的“限制”呢？但广大人民是欢迎这些“限制”的，因为这是保障绝大多数人的合理合法的自由的必要条件。
    其实关于“社会主义国家只有集体自由，没有个人自由”的说法，也纯是一种曲解或诬蔑。正确的说法，应该是：社会主义国家里，只允许有符合集体利益的个人自由（集体总是由个人结合成的，有集体的自由就有集体成员的个人自由），不允许有反对或破坏集体利益的自由。而某些人要用以“补充”社会主义制度的那种“自由”，正是我们所说的破坏集体利益的自由。“补充”的目的，也不过是要使之合法化，因而剥夺人们反对这种“自由”的自由而已。
    邓小平同志的报告中所要反对的那种种“自由”，不正是破坏社会主义制度，损害人民正常生活利益的“自由”吗？他指出的“大法不犯，小法常犯”的“法”，不正是指的集体利益、人民正常的生活利益吗？除了农村中的那种种“大法不犯，小法常犯”的现象以外，我们在城市中，也看到一些所谓“大错不犯，小错不断”（诸如破坏公共秩序，损坏公物，道德败坏的言行，以及违犯劳动纪律）的人物，歪着脑袋，瞪起三角眼来，向着反对他们的人大喝：“你管得着，这是我的自由。”如果给这种人以这种“自由”，就使更多的人失去了反对他们的“自由”的自由。而“公约”、“委员会”者正是为了保障人们的这种自由。倘人民连反对妨碍人民自由的自由都没有？那还算得人民天下吗？
    然而，这些“自由”人究竟犯的是“小法”、“小错”，因此也无须送到法院去法办；于是，便用“一种群众性的自我教育、自我监督、自我约束的办法”，用“一种社会主义限制个人主义，改变旧风俗习惯，形成新的风俗习惯的重要方法”来解决。“小法”、“小错”的常犯，是既基于“个人主义”，又基于“习惯势力”的；而且，“小”的不改，必至发展成为“大”的。用了集体的力量，来帮助除去“小错”，避免他们因演成“大错”而沦为人民的敌人，直走到身败名裂的地步，岂不也是一件功德无量的大好事。
