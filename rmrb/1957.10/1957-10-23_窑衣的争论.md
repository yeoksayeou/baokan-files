The electric whistle had just stopped, and the miners were already gathering in the workshop. The workshop chairman stood up and said:
　　“Last night, everyone listened to Chairman Lu of the trade union's report. Today, let's continue the big debate!”
　　“I want to speak,” a young man with yellow hair in the corner of the room leaned forward. “Regarding the issue of issuing work clothes, I think one set a year is too few. It should be two or three sets of mine clothes a year. We miners have difficulties, and it's easy to wear out clothes… This time, the mine clothes are made of pocket cloth, which is too hard, makes work inconvenient, and even chafes the skin… I suggest that the leadership buy khaki cloth, which is convenient and durable.” After the young man finished speaking, he twisted his neck to look at the back. An old man with white hair was sitting in the back, striking a match to light a cigarette.
　　“I agree with Hu Hai's speech,” a young miner sitting next to the workshop chairman stood up. He looked about twenty-five or six years old. “Work clothes should be issued at least two sets a year. Less than that is not enough to wear. How can workers go to work if they don't have mine clothes? Pocket cloth is not suitable for making mine clothes. Everyone says there are three dislikes: first, workers don't like wearing them because they are not convenient for work; second, they are too thick and difficult for tailors to sew; and third, they are difficult for their wives at home to wash. My wife said, ‘What's the use of that? It stands up in the water and can't be washed. Just give everyone a pocket.’ I think the leadership should issue some good cloth!”
　　The meeting place stirred up, and a few people laughed.
　　“Chairman, let me say a few words,” a person with a hoarse voice and a thin stature spoke. “I disagree with what Hu Hai and Liu Wenhua said just now. One set of mine clothes a year is enough, and some people even have a surplus. Hu Hai, Liu Wenhua, let me ask you, have the mine clothes you were issued last year been torn? Can you still wear them? You say the pocket cloth is hard, but I've also tried it, it's quite soft and comfortable to wear. Right now, the state is calling for thrift and asking us to run enterprises diligently and frugally. I don't think what you two said is in line with this spirit.”
　　“Right, right, let me chime in,” a young man in a blue uniform stood up suddenly. “Liu Wenhua said that pocket cloth work clothes have three dislikes, but in my opinion, there are three major advantages. First, they are warm and windproof; second, they are durable and wear-resistant; and third, they are impermeable to dripping water. In addition, the pocket cloth is not very thick, the tailor can sew it smoothly, and as long as the wife loves her man, she can sew and wash it for you even if it's made of iron.”
　　There was another burst of laughter.
　　“Ahem,” an old miner coughed a few times and said, “I've been in this coal mine for more than thirty years. Before liberation, who issued us mine clothes? We went down the mine wrapped in a tattered sack. At that time, we only cared about going down the mine to work and support our families. We didn't care whether the work was convenient or not. I think this pocket cloth is very good. It's waterproof and convenient for work. What three dislikes or four dislikes, the cloth is a bit thicker and harder to wash, but it can still be washed. Don't listen to your wives whispering in your ears… Little Hai, you haven't suffered, you don't know the suffering of working in the mine before liberation. Twenty years ago, I and your father…” He paused and looked at the old man sitting behind Hu Hai—that was Hu Hai's father. “…we worked in the mine together. We never wore clothes,…” He couldn't go on, his lips kept trembling. Finally, he looked at Hu Hai's father and said, “Brother Fukui, you say something….”
　　At this moment, the meeting place became serious, and everyone's eyes turned to Hu Hai's father—Hu Fukui.
　　“You say something,” the workshop chairman said.
　　“Okay, let me chat.” Hu Fukui straightened his back. His hair was all white, and his chin was covered with white stubble, but his body was very strong.
　　“I'll continue what Ma Ruixi said just now.” He glanced at his son sitting in front of him. “Little Hai, Uncle Ma is right. I've been working in this mine with him for more than thirty years. Before liberation, I never wore a decent set of clothes. At that time, everyone said: ‘Wearing tattered sacks, eating bean cake pieces, covering your head with a raincoat when it's cold, and burying your feet in stove ashes when they're cold.’ In the year of the ‘July 7th’ Incident, which was the year your mother gave birth to you, you didn't even have a piece of clothing when you were born. I had to borrow it from someone else. At that time, we miners had only one set of clothes, both in and out of the mine. Little Hai, and you—Liu Wenhua, don't forget your roots. You still complain about being issued a set of three new mine clothes every year? The leadership is afraid that we'll freeze, get wet, or get chafed, so they issued us mine clothes made of pocket cloth. We should thank the leadership, thank the Party….”
　　Before Hu Fukui finished speaking, he aroused a burst of applause. People couldn't help but look at Little Hai and Liu Wenhua, only to see them lowering their heads and applauding with everyone else!

    窑衣的争论
    周隆潇
    电笛儿音刚落，矿工们就在车间里集合齐了。车间主席站起来说：
    “昨天晚末晌，大伙儿听了工会路主席的报告了，今天就接着大辩论吧！”
    “我发言，”屋角一个黄头发小伙子欠了欠身子。“关于发工作服问题，我觉得一年发一身太少了，应该一年两身或者一年三身窑衣。我们礃子困难，容易磨破衣服……这回窑衣发口袋布的，太硬，干活儿不灵便，还拉肉……我建议上级买咔叽布的，又方便又结实。”小伙子说完，拧脖子瞅瞅后尾儿。后尾儿坐着一个花白头发的老头儿，正在划洋火抽烟。
      “我赞成胡海的发言，”坐在车间主席旁边的一个青年矿工站起来，看样子，他才二十五、六岁。“工作服一年最少应当发两套，少了不够穿，工人穿不上窑衣怎么能上班。口袋布做窑衣不成，大伙儿都说有三不乐意：一是工人干活穿着不灵便，不乐意；二是太厚实，裁缝不好砸，不乐意；三是家里老婆不好洗，不乐意。我老婆就说：‘要那个干吗，放在水里立着，没法儿洗。干脆一人发一个口袋得啦。’我看，领导上还是发点好布的吧！”
    会场骚动起来，有几个人发出了笑声。
    “主席，让我说说，”一个有着干哑的嗓子，瘦削的个儿的人说话了。“我不同意刚才胡海跟刘文华说的。一年一身窑衣足够了，而且有人还有富余。胡海，刘文华，我问问你，你们俩去年发的窑衣破了没有？还能穿吗？你们说口袋布硬，可我也试过，挺棉软，穿着挺舒服。眼下，国家号召节约，叫咱们勤俭办企业，我看你们俩说的就不符合这精神。”
      “对对，让我来鸣一鸣，”一个穿青制服的小伙子霍地站起来。“刘文华说口袋布的工作服有三不乐意，依我看，倒有三大好处。一是挡风暖和；二是经穿耐磨；三是遇见有点淋头水，浸不透。另外，口袋布并不很厚，裁缝砸很顺当，家里媳妇只要疼男人，就是铁做的她也给你缝洗得了。”
    接着是一阵笑声。
      “咳咳，”一位老矿工咳嗽了几声说道：“我在这煤矿上有三十多年了，解放前那阵，谁发给我们过窑衣，下窑披着块破麻袋，那时只顾下窑干活养活家口，哪管干活灵便不灵便。我看，这口袋布的就挺好，穿着干活又不透水又灵便，什么三不乐意四不乐意，布厚点是难洗点，但还是能洗，甭听她家属老婆小耳朵风在一边扇……小海子，你没受过苦，不知道解放前走窑的苦处，二十年前我跟你爸爸……”他顿了顿，瞅了瞅胡海后尾坐着的老头儿——那就是胡海他爹。“……我们一块下窑，五冬六夏，哪儿穿过衣服，……”他说不下去了，嘴唇不住哆嗦，末后，他望着胡海他爸爸说：“福魁哥，你说说吧……。”
    这当儿，会场变得严肃了，大伙儿的眼光都转向胡海的爸爸——胡福魁。
      “您就说说吧。”车间主席说道。
      “好，我来聊聊。”胡福魁挺直了腰板。他的头发全白了，下巴颏也长满了白胡子碴，但身子骨挺硬朗。
      “我接着刚才马瑞喜说。”他瞅了瞅坐在他前面的儿子一眼。“小海子，马大伯的话很对，我跟他在这矿上下井三十多年了，解放前，从来没穿过一件齐整衣服，那时，大伙儿都说：‘穿的是破麻袋，吃的是豆饼块，头冷蓑衣盖，脚凉灶灰埋’。‘七七’事变那年，就是你妈生你那一年，你生下来，连衣服都没一件，还是我跟别人借的。那阵子，我们下窑的，窑上窑下就那一身衣裳。小海子，还有你——刘文华，别忘了本，每年发一身三新的窑衣还嫌不好？领导上怕我们冻着、浇着、蹭着，才发给我们口袋布的窑衣，我们应该感谢领导，感谢党……。”
    胡福魁发言没完，就引起一阵鼓掌声，人们不由得向小海子和刘文华望过去，只见他俩低着头，也跟着大家一起鼓掌呢！
