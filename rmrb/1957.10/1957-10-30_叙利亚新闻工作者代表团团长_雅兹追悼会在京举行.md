Among those attending the memorial service were Deng Tuo, President of the All-China Journalists Association; Gong Peng, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ke Hua, Director of the West Asia and Africa Department; Da Punsheng, President of the Sino-Syrian Friendship Association; Zhang Jie, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association; Adib Sha'lan, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Syrian Embassy in China; heads and representatives of various news organizations in Beijing and various Chinese democratic parties; as well as Raghaba, the Egyptian Ambassador to China, representatives of the Korean Embassy and the Press Office of the Soviet Embassy, and more than 200 foreign journalists in Beijing.

　　Deng Tuo delivered a eulogy at the meeting, saying, "Today, we are here with deep sorrow to mourn Mr. Tofik Yaz, head of the Syrian Journalists Delegation visiting China. Mr. Tofik Yaz came to China for the cause of friendship between the people of China and Syria. Today, we can comfort him before his spirit: his visit to China with the delegation he led has deeply sown the seeds of friendship in the hearts of the people of our two countries. The footprints they left on Chinese soil will forever be a testament to the friendship between the Chinese and Syrian people. During his lifetime, Mr. Tofik Yaz was concerned day and night about the safety of his motherland and the sacred cause of the Syrian people in defending their national independence. Today, we can comfort him before his spirit: the heroic Syrian people are united as one, sharing a common hatred against the enemy, and are preparing to give the invaders a heavy blow. The people of Arab countries are also united in solidarity with the struggle of the Syrian people. All the forces of peace in the world firmly stand on the side of the Syrian people. Our 600 million Chinese people will always cooperate wholeheartedly with the Syrian people who are resisting imperialist aggression and fight together for the cause of justice."

　　Adib Sha'lan then spoke. He said, "The death of our dear colleague, Mr. Tofik Yaz, has brought us great misfortune. The hand of death has taken away a kind face, a noble person loyal to the motherland. Mr. Yaz served the motherland faithfully until his last breath. He was a senior member of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and he showed loyalty and selflessness in all the positions he held. His death has deprived the Syrian diplomatic community of an important pillar that has made great contributions to the motherland." Adib Sha'lan finally expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Chinese and foreign people who attended the memorial service, and to the friendly Chinese news community and the Sino-Syrian Friendship Association.

　　The memorial service passed a condolence message to the family of Mr. Tofik Yaz.

    新华社29日讯　叙利亚新闻工作者访华代表团团长、叙利亚外交部新闻司司长托菲克·雅兹先生的追悼会29日下午在北京嘉兴寺举行。
    庄严肃穆的礼堂内悬挂着托菲克·雅兹先生的遗像，四周摆满了北京中外新闻单位、外交部、文化部、中叙友协、中国各民主党派和各人民团体，以及叙利亚大使馆、埃及大使馆、苏联大使馆新闻处和朝鲜大使馆赠送的花圈。参加追悼会的，有中华全国新闻工作者协会会长邓拓，外交部新闻司司长龚澎、西亚非洲司司长柯华，中叙友好协会会长达浦生，中国伊斯兰教协会副主任张杰，叙利亚驻华大使馆临时代办阿迪卜·沙蓝，北京各新闻单位和中国各民主党派的负责人和代表，以及埃及驻华大使拉加卜、朝鲜大使馆和苏联大使馆新闻处的代表，在北京的外国记者共二百余人。
    邓拓在会上致悼词说，今天我们怀着沉痛的心情在这里悼念叙利亚新闻工作者访华代表团团长托菲克·雅兹先生。托菲克·雅兹先生是为了中叙两国人民友好的事业来到中国的。今天，我们在托菲克·雅兹先生的灵前可以向他告慰的是：他和他所率领的代表团在中国的访问，已经在我们两国人民的心中深深地播下了友谊的种子。他们在中国土地上所留下的足迹将永远成为中叙两国人民友好的见证。托菲克·雅兹先生生前日夜关怀他的祖国的安危，关怀叙利亚人民保卫祖国独立的神圣事业。今天，我们在托菲克·雅兹先生的灵前可以向他告慰的是：英勇的叙利亚人民正团结一致，同仇敌忾，准备给予侵略者以沉重的打击。阿拉伯各国人民也正团结一致声援着叙利亚人民的斗争。全世界和平的力量都坚决地站在叙利亚人民这一边。我们六万万中国人民将始终不渝地同反抗帝国主义侵略的叙利亚人民齐心合作，为正义事业而共同奋斗。

    追悼会通过了给托菲克·雅兹先生家属的唁电。
