Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot. During the First Five-Year Plan period, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region increased its production of various livestock by more than 6.44 million head. The total number of livestock in the region has now reached more than 22.16 million head.

According to historical records, the highest year for livestock development in Inner Mongolia was 1936, with more than 9.37 million head of livestock. However, by the time the autonomous region was liberated in 1946, only 7.51 million head remained. After the establishment of the autonomous region, by 1949, livestock production had already recovered to the 1936 level.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, in addition to supporting industrial and agricultural production within the region with a large number of livestock and animal products, herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region also transported more than 1.66 million head of draught animals, beef cattle, and sheep, more than 60 million jin of wool and down, and more than 8 million hides to other regions, supporting socialist construction.

The great achievements made in livestock production in the autonomous region during the First Five-Year Plan period are inseparable from the hard work of herdsmen of all ethnic groups and the strong support of the state for livestock production. During this period, Mongolian herdsmen on the grasslands overcame several severe snowstorms in 1954 and 1956, ensuring the safety of the herds. During this period, the herdsmen received more than 16.9 million yuan in loans from the state, adding a large number of seeding machines, waterwheels, snowplows and other pastoral production tools. The state also used a large amount of funds to build livestock machinery factories, grassland tractor stations and grassland mechanical water supply stations in the autonomous region. Livestock workers of all ethnic groups also used fine breeds of livestock introduced by the state to improve more than 580,000 head of livestock. Mongolian herdsmen also established feed bases on the grasslands and developed water sources. These basic construction projects, which directly served livestock production, played a great role in the great development of livestock production in the autonomous region.

    内蒙古五年增产牲畜六百多万头
    据新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区在第一个五年计划期间，增产了各种牲畜六百四十四万多头，全区牲畜总头数现在已经达到二千二百一十六万多头。
    根据历史记载，内蒙古牲畜发展最高年份是1936年，有九百三十七万多头牲畜。但到1946年自治区解放时，仅剩下七百五十一万头。自治区成立后，到1949年，畜牧业生产就已恢复到1936年的水平。
    第一个五年计划期间，自治区各民族牧民除以大量牲畜和畜产品支援区内工、农业生产外，还向区外输送出一百六十六万多头耕畜、食用牛羊，六千多万斤毛绒和八百多万张皮革，支援了社会主义建设。
    自治区第一个五年计划期间在畜牧业生产上取得的伟大成就，是同各民族牧民的辛勤劳动和国家对畜牧业生产的大力扶助分不开的。在这期间，草原上的蒙古族牧民分别在1954年和1956年战胜了数次大风雪灾害，保证了畜群的安全。这期间牧民们得到国家一千六百九十多万元贷款，增添大批耧草机、水车、破雪器等牧业生产工具，国家还用大量资金在自治区兴建了畜牧业机械厂、草原拖拉机站和草原机械供水站。各民族的畜牧业工作者还用国家引进的优良种牲畜，改良了五十八万多头牲畜。蒙古族牧民们还在草原上建立了饲料基地，开辟了水源。这些直接为畜牧业生产服务的各项基本建设，对自治区畜牧业的大发展起了很大作用。
