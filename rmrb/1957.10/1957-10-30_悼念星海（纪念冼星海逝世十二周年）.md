    In Memory of Xian Xinghai (Commemorating the Twelfth Anniversary of Xian Xinghai's Death)
    Fushi
    People once praised noble friendship, and you left the sound of the piano lingering in my heart. Twelve years is not too long, why can't my comrade-in-arms wield his whip and sing loudly for the socialist revolution and new stars!? Ocean! Please stop the wind and calm the waves, I want to quietly listen to the echo of my comrade-in-arms! Giant ship! Please drop anchor and sound your whistle, tell my comrade-in-arms: I am searching for his heroic spirit all over the world. That night someone knocked on my window, "Xinghai is here!" I flew up from the bed like an eagle, followed that warm smile and profound eyes, pierced into the sky, intoxicated and ecstatically holding my comrade-in-arms' hand, plunged into the fierce pressure of the great wind and rain and the formation of a million warhorses roaring. This impact was truly intense, my heart beat like a war drum with continuous taps, it was the passionate joy of battle and friendship—a hearty, inseparable feeling... With a sharp sound, the tip of the whip fell: the sun shone brightly and the sky was clear! My hot tears and sweat dripped down together, when I woke up I only saw the bright moon in front of the bed and the stars outside the window, listening to the incessant chirping of insects playing together, it was also like the sound of the Yan River sending the camel bells that my comrade-in-arms was listening to. I can call my comrade-in-arms thousands of times in my memory, but my comrade-in-arms could not meet his mother before the final farewell! Although the spring breeze of the motherland blows north every year, although the great alliance sends love across the border, the lack of my comrade-in-arms' singing is always a significant loss. Let us put away sorrow and regret, and embark on the journey opened up by our comrade-in-arms! The journey, already explored and infinitely vast, is like the boundless waves of the ocean unfolding in my comrade-in-arms' great chest! Do you miss me? Yes, I do! Do you know that the motherland has realized your ideals? Do you know that the world no longer belongs to imperialism? Those who bullied you will perish, or die in decay! If you were here, the mighty song of joy would further shock the world!

    悼念星海（纪念冼星海逝世十二周年）
    俯拾人们曾经歌颂高贵的友情，你在我的心里长留下琴声。十二年的时间不算太长，为什么不能让我的战友为社会主义革命和新星挥鞭昂鸣！？海洋！请你停风息浪，我要静听我战友的回音！巨舰！请你抛锚鸣笛，告诉我的战友：我在天涯海角遍找他的英灵。那天夜里有人敲我的窗，“星海来了！”我在床上飞起像一只鹰，跟着那温厚的笑、深湛的眼钻入天空，如醉如痴的挽着战友的手，投入那大风大雨的猛压和百万战马暴啸的阵形。这一场冲击啊真是激烈，我的心脏敲的像战鼓连点不停，是战斗的、友谊的激情喜悦——酣畅的难解难分，……划然一声，鞭梢一落：日朗天晴！我的热泪与热汗一起淋泠，醒来只见床前的明月和窗外的星星，听听那鸣叫不已的虫声合奏，又像是延河的水声送来战友伏听的骆驼铃。我能够凭记忆叫战友千次万次，战友不能在永别前会见母亲！虽然祖国的春风年年吹出北国，虽然伟大的盟邦把热爱送过边境，没有战友的歌唱啊总是损失不轻。且收拾哀伤和遗憾，登上战友开辟的路程！路程，已开拓的无限广远，像海洋的万顷波涛开阔在我战友的伟大胸襟！你怀念我么？怀念的！你知道祖国已把你的理想实行？你知道世界已不属于帝国主义的了？欺负你的将要灭亡、或者死在雕零！你如在，浩荡的欢歌将更使天地震惊！
