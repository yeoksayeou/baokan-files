　　The Fruits of Friendship
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Chunlie
    Near Shagang Village in the suburbs of Dalian, there is a small orchard. This summer, the orchard blossomed and bore fruit for the first time. The farmers invited a photographer to take pictures of the orchard laden with peaches and sent them to the Soviet troops who had been stationed in the Lushunkou area; they also sent the first batch of fresh peaches they picked to the Soviet Consulate General in Dalian.

    This orchard is no ordinary orchard; it symbolizes the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. Two years ago, in the spring, when the Soviet troops were about to leave Lushun-Dalian, the farmers of Lushun-Dalian and the Soviet troops planted peach saplings together here to commemorate their ten years of friendship, and named the orchard the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Orchard."

    When the Lushun-Dalian farmers sent the Soviet troops the photos of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Orchard" full of fruit, they also wrote a letter telling them about the happy lives of the people here today and thanking them for their past help. The Soviet Consul General in Dalian shook the hand of the peach-giver tightly and said: The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has firmly grown in the hearts of the people of both countries.

    In the past ten years, the friendship between the Soviet troops and the Lushun-Dalian farmers was truly deeper than the sea. Two years after the Soviet troops left Lushun-Dalian, no matter which village you go to, as soon as you mention the Soviet troops, people always talk about the past deeds of friendship with a feeling of longing. Soon after Lushun-Dalian was liberated, one day, two Soviet soldiers—Sergei and Ilolai—came to the home of old farmer Yu Pingshun. They kindly said to Yu Pingshun, "Dad, take a rest, let us help you." Before the old farmer could answer, the two took off their boots and socks and jumped into the pigsty to shovel manure and line the pen. From that day on, whenever these two Soviet soldiers had time, they would come to help Yu Pingshun deliver manure, cultivate the land, and sow seeds, doing all kinds of work. Because of their help, Yu Pingshun was able to apply manure well and in large quantities, and the land was cultivated deeply and loosely, so that the corn grew strong stalks and large ears, and in the autumn, he harvested five more dou of grain per mu. The Soviet troops not only helped the farmers with labor, but also gave them a lot of help in terms of materials. In the early years after liberation, American imperialism supported the Kuomintang in blockading Lushun-Dalian from the sea and land, and the farmers lacked draught animals, so the Soviet troops sent war horses to help the farmers cultivate the land. The farmers lacked seeds and fertilizers, so the Soviet troops transported thousands of tons of improved seeds and fertilizer powder. Whenever there was a drought, the Soviet troops used trucks to haul water to irrigate the farmers' land; when there were insect pests, the Soviet troops used airplanes to spread pesticide powder to help eliminate the pests. It was with the help of the Soviet troops that the Lushun-Dalian farmers survived the most difficult days, and grain production nearly doubled in two or three years. The Soviet troops also helped some villages in Lushun-Dalian install electric lights and build clubs, and often brought film projectors to the countryside to show movies to the farmers. When the farmers were sick, the Soviet doctors always rushed to treat them, day or night.

    The Lushun-Dalian farmers, who had spent forty years of enslavement under Japanese rule, deeply loved the Soviet troops. Farmer Wang Zhizhi saw on the way that the Soviet troops' water truck was broken, so he rushed to use his own water truck to send water to the Soviet military camp. Wang Jinfeng and her mother-in-law went to the river to wash clothes. Every time they met Soviet soldiers washing clothes there, they always took the clothes and helped them wash them. Members of the Red Star First Agricultural Cooperative heard that Soviet soldiers liked to eat Jerusalem artichokes, so they tried to find Jerusalem artichoke roots to cultivate. Such stories of friendship were everywhere in the Lushun-Dalian countryside in the past. Every time during the severe cold and snowy winter, many farmers helped the Soviet troops clear the snow from the roads on the hills; in the hot summer, they helped the Soviet troops repair the roads damaged by rain.

    The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is deeply imprinted in the hearts of the people of Lushun-Dalian. The stories of friendship between the Soviet troops and the Lushun-Dalian farmers have been written into articles and taken into photos, and are being widely spread.

### 友谊的果实

　　友谊的果实
　　新华社记者　赵春烈
    在大连市郊沙岗村旁有个小小的果园。今年夏天，这个果园已经初次开花结果。农民们请来摄影师，把挂满了桃子的果园拍下照片，寄给曾经驻旅顺口地区的苏军部队；并把摘下的第一批鲜桃，送给了苏联驻大连总领事馆。
    这个果园不是一个普通的果园，它象征着中苏两国人民的深厚友谊。两年前的春天，当苏军将要离开旅大时，旅大农民和苏军为了纪念相处十年的友谊，在这里一起种下了桃树苗，并命名这个果园为“中苏友谊果园”。
    旅大农民在把“中苏友谊果园”结满果实的照片寄给苏军的时候，还写了一封信，告诉他们今天这里人民的幸福生活，感谢他们往日的帮助。苏联驻大连总领事紧紧地握着送桃人的手说：中苏人民的友谊已经牢固地生长在两国人民的心里。
    在过去的十年岁月中，苏军和旅大农民建立起的友谊，真是比海还深。在苏军离开旅大两年后的今天，不管你走到那个村庄，只要一提起苏军，人们总是怀着思念的心情，向你谈述起往日的友谊事迹。在旅大刚解放不久，有一天，老农民于平顺家里来了两个苏军战士——谢尔盖和依洛莱。他们亲切地对于平顺说：“爸爸，你歇一歇，让我们帮你干吧。”还没等这个老农民答言，两个人就脱下靴袜，跳进猪圈去铲粪，垫圈。从那天起，这两个苏军战士一有空，就来帮助于平顺送粪、耕地、播种，什么活都干。于平顺因为有他俩帮助，粪上得又好又多，地耕得又深又松，使苞米长得棵粗穗大，到秋天每亩地多收了五斗粮食。苏军不仅帮助农民劳动，在物质上也给了农民们很多帮助。在解放后的最初几年，美帝国主义支持国民党从海陆封锁了旅大，农民耕畜不足，苏军就派出战马帮助农民耕地。农民缺少种子、肥料，苏军又运来千百吨的优良种子和肥田粉。逢到天旱时，苏军就用汽车拉水给农民浇地；有了虫灾时，苏军又用飞机撒药粉帮助消灭虫灾。就是在苏军这样帮助下，旅大农民度过了最困难的日子，粮食产量两三年内就增加了将近一倍。苏军还帮助旅大一些村庄安上了电灯，修建起俱乐部，经常带着电影机到农村去给农民放映电影。农民有了病，不管白天黑夜，苏军医生总是赶来医治。
    在日本统治下度过了四十年奴役生活的旅大农民，深深地热爱着苏军。农民王志治在半道上看到苏军的水车坏了，就抢着用自己的水车把水送到苏军军营里。王金凤和她的婆婆到河边洗衣服，每次遇到苏军战士也在那里洗衣服，她们总是把衣服夺过来帮助他们洗。红星第一农业社社员们听说苏军战士爱吃洋姜，就想法弄来洋姜根培植。像这样的友谊事迹，过去在旅大农村里到处都可以看到。每当严寒的风雪冬季，都有很多农民在山坡上帮助苏军扫除道上的积雪；在暑热的夏天，他们又帮助苏军修复雨水冲毁的道路。
    中苏人民的友谊深深刻印在旅大人们的心里。苏军和旅大农民的友谊事迹，已经被写成文章，拍成照片，日益广泛地流传着。
