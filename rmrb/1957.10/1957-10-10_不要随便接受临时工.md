    Don't Accept Temporary Workers Casually
    Starting from April this year, members of the Shijiadian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Honglan Township, Lishui County, Jiangsu Province, have seen 30 to 50 people per month blindly flowing into the brickyards and construction section of the Xiangshan area in Ma'anshan City, Anhui Province, to work as temporary laborers. The brickyards accept anyone without asking for introduction letters or inquiring whether they are good or bad people. Some farmers from nearby agricultural cooperatives have also gone, severely affecting agricultural production. In the fifth team of this cooperative, fifteen full laborers from thirty-six households have left at once, and over twenty mu of medium-season rice that should have been harvested long ago have not been harvested yet. Although the rice in the seventh team has been threshed and brought to the threshing ground, over three hundred dan of rice straw have been left in the fields for a long time and have become moldy. The cooperative's original sideline occupations have also gradually decreased. In the hemp storage areas, mulberry fields, and tung oil tree fields, the weeds have grown taller than the hemp, mulberry, and tung oil trees. After the cooperative members went to Ma'anshan, they received no education, and capitalist ideas have been constantly rising. This summer, many people have been selling rice on the black market in Ma'anshan. According to incomplete investigations in two teams of this cooperative, over three thousand jin of rice have been trafficked and sold on the black market in Ma'anshan City. Phenomena such as gambling, theft, and excessive eating and drinking at construction sites have also been constantly occurring.
    I believe that, in addition to the township educating cooperative cadres and party members, the labor department in Ma'anshan City should not casually accept temporary workers. I hope that the responsible persons of the brickyard and construction section will quickly mobilize these people to return to the cooperative for production, improve agricultural production, and better support industrial construction.

    不要随便接受临时工
    江苏省溧水县洪蓝乡石家甸农业生产合作社的社员，从今年4月份起，每月有三十至五十人盲目流入安徽省马鞍山市向山地区窑场和基建科做临时工。窑场既不要介绍信，也不问是好人还是坏人，一见就收。附近几个农业社的农民也有些人去，严重影响了农业生产。这个社五队三十六户人家一次就去了十五个整劳动力，早已应该收割的中籼稻有二十多亩迟迟没有收割。七队的稻子虽打上场，但有三百多担稻草长时间放在田里霉烂。社里原有的副业也逐渐变少，贮麻地、桑树地、桐油树地，草长得比麻、桑、油桐还高。社员去马鞍山后无人教育，资本主义思想不断上升，今年夏天贩米到马鞍山黑市去卖的很多。据这个社两个队不完全调查，贩到马鞍山市卖黑市的米，就有三千多斤。在工地上赌钱、偷窃、吃喝的现象也不断产生。
    我认为，除了乡里应该向社干部与党员进行教育外，马鞍山市劳动部门不应该这样随便接受临时人员做工。希望该窑场和基建科负责人迅速动员这些人回社生产，搞好农业生产，更好地支援工业建设。
