    The Pebble's Edges
    Li Zhongping

    The pebble fiercely attacked the sea, but the sea remained silent. The pebble, convinced of its righteousness, shouted: "I was originally a stone full of edges and corners. Why did you grind me into a pebble? This is a destruction of me, a persecution of me! Return my edges and corners!! Return..."
    The sea still ignored it.
    A tourist on the beach heard this and couldn't help but interject:
    "Has the sea ever smoothed out the branches of coral? Has the sea ever dulled the sharp points of crystal? They have always been so crystal clear and beautiful. You, pebble, what kind of edges and corners are you asking to be returned? Your edges and corners can only hurt the feet of tourists and make children constantly fall. You would turn an inviting beach into a place to be avoided. Remember, it is the sea that has turned you into a beautiful and smooth pebble; otherwise, you would only be something harmful."

    鹅卵石的棱角
    李中平
    鹅卵石恶狠狠地攻击大海，大海默不作声。鹅卵石自以为理直，大叫起来：“我本是生满棱角的石块，你为什么把我磨成卵石呢？这是对我的摧残，这是对我的迫害！还我棱角来！！还我……”
    大海仍然不理睬它。
    海滨的游人听到了，忍不住插嘴说：
    “大海可曾磨光珊瑚的椏?吗？大海可曾磨光水晶的锥锋吗？它们从来就是那般地晶莹美丽。你，鹅卵石，你讨还什么样的棱角呢？你的棱角只能刺伤游人的脚掌，让孩子们不断摔交，你会使诱人的海滨变成令人却步的地方。该记住，正是大海使你变成了美丽滑润的鹅卵石，否则，你就只能是有害的东西。”
