In accordance with Article 18 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which states, "All personnel of state organs must be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the Constitution and the law, and strive to serve the people," and in order to continuously enhance the socialist consciousness of the personnel of state administrative organs, promote their initiative and creativity in their work, prevent and correct illegal and derelict behavior of personnel of state administrative organs, and to effectively ensure the smooth completion of the socialist construction, the following provisions are now made regarding awards and penalties for personnel of state administrative organs:

    I. Personnel of state administrative organs must resolutely implement the state's various policies, laws, and decrees, abide by the government's resolutions, orders, and regulations, conscientiously complete the various work tasks assigned by the state, cherish and protect public property, maintain state secrets, and establish a fine style of hard work and plain living, modesty and prudence, and close ties with the masses.

    II. Personnel of state administrative organs who exhibit the following behaviors should be rewarded:
      (1) Those who are loyal to their duties, perform well, abide by discipline, and set an example;
      (2) Those who have inventions and creations in their work, put forward rationalization proposals, and make significant contributions to the state;
      (3) Those who successfully prevent or rescue accidents, protecting the interests of the state and the people from significant losses;
      (4) Those who have made significant achievements in cherishing public property and saving state funds;
      (5) Those who resolutely fight against serious illegal and derelict behavior and have made significant contributions;
      (6) Others who should be rewarded.

    III. Rewards are divided into six types: recording merit, recording major merit, awarding prizes or bonuses, promotion in grade, promotion in position, and issuing a circular of commendation. These rewards can be used individually or in combination.

    IV. Recording merit, recording major merit, awarding prizes or bonuses, and promotion in grade are given by the organ or higher-level organ to which the staff member belongs; promotion in position is given by the organ that appoints the new position; a circular of commendation is given by the State Council, departments of the State Council, or the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government.

    Awards for staff members should be announced at appropriate meetings or in newspapers, and a written notice should be given to the individual, and recorded in their personal file.

    V. Personnel of state administrative organs who commit the following illegal or derelict behaviors that do not constitute a crime should be given disciplinary sanctions. If the circumstances are minor, disciplinary sanctions may be waived after criticism and education.
      (1) Violating state policies, laws, decrees, and government resolutions, orders, regulations, and systems;
      (2) Neglecting duties and delaying work;
      (3) Violating democratic centralism, disobeying resolutions and orders from superiors, suppressing criticism, and retaliating;
      (4) Engaging in fraud and deceiving the organization;
      (5) Sowing discord and undermining unity;
      (6) Losing one's stand and shielding bad people;
      (7) Embezzling and stealing state property;
      (8) Wasting state funds and damaging public property;
      (9) Abusing power, infringing upon the interests of the people, and harming the relationship between state organs and the people;
      (10) Disclosing state secrets;
      (11) Becoming corrupt and degenerate, and damaging the prestige of state organs;
      (12) Other violations of state discipline.

    VI. Disciplinary sanctions are divided into eight types: warning, recording demerit, recording major demerit, demotion in grade, demotion in position, removal from position, expulsion with probation, and expulsion.

    VII. When state administrative organs investigate disciplinary responsibility and impose disciplinary sanctions on staff members who violate state discipline, they must adhere to the principle of seriousness and caution, and give appropriate disciplinary sanctions or waive sanctions based on the nature and severity of the error, with reference to the individual's usual performance and degree of recognition of the error.

    Personnel who violate state discipline, causing certain losses to the interests of the state and the people, but can still continue to hold their current position, may be given a warning, recording demerit, recording major demerit, or demotion in grade.

    Personnel who seriously violate state discipline, causing significant losses to the interests of the state and the people, and cannot continue to hold their current position, may be given a demotion in position or removal from position. If there is no position to demote to or remove from, a demotion in grade may be given.

    For elements who seriously violate laws and are derelict in their duties, repeatedly fail to mend their ways, or have degenerated and are beyond redemption, and are not suitable for continuing to work in state administrative organs, an expulsion sanction may be given. For some of these personnel, in order to give them a final opportunity to repent, lenient treatment may be given based on the specific circumstances, and an expulsion with probation sanction may be given.

    Counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements who have infiltrated state administrative organs to carry out sabotage activities must be resolutely expelled from state organs and dealt with according to law.

    VIII. If personnel of state administrative organs violate criminal law and the circumstances are minor and do not warrant criminal prosecution, appropriate disciplinary sanctions may be given, or sanctions may be waived after criticism and education.

    If personnel of state administrative organs are sentenced by a people's court to public surveillance, imprisonment, or deprivation of political rights, their positions will be naturally revoked. For personnel sentenced to imprisonment with a suspended sentence, their positions will also be naturally revoked. During the probation period, if they can still remain in the organ to continue working, appropriate work should be assigned according to the specific circumstances.

    IX. When state administrative organs discover that their subordinate staff members have violated discipline and should be given disciplinary sanctions, they must handle the matter promptly and must not delay it without reason. Generally, sanctions should be given within six months from the date of discovery of the error. If the circumstances are complicated or there are other special reasons, the deadline should not exceed two years.

    X. The authority for disciplinary sanctions shall be exercised in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1) Disciplinary sanctions for staff members of each level of state administrative organs who are appointed by their own organ shall be decided and implemented by the respective organ.

    Demotion in position, removal from position, expulsion with probation, and expulsion sanctions for department heads (or equivalent personnel) and above appointed by departments of the State Council and people’s committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should be reported to the State Council for the record.

      (2) Disciplinary sanctions for personnel appointed by higher-level organs: warnings, recording demerit, recording major demerit, and demotion in grade sanctions shall be decided and implemented by the directly superior level, and reported to the appointing organ for the record; demotion in position, removal from position, expulsion with probation, and expulsion sanctions shall be decided by the directly superior level and implemented after approval by the appointing organ.

    The expulsion of staff members by state administrative organs below the county (city) level must be reported to the county (city) people’s committee for approval.

      (3) For personnel who hold state administrative positions by election of people’s congresses at various local levels, warnings, recording demerit, recording major demerit, and demotion in grade sanctions shall be decided and implemented by the higher-level organ. For personnel who seriously violate discipline and are not suitable for holding their current position, they should be removed from their position by the people’s congress at their level, and the people’s committee at their level shall report to the higher-level organ for the record. Before the removal, the higher-level organ may first suspend them from their position. When necessary, the higher-level organ may also remove them from their position.

      (4) When state administrative organs discover that the disciplinary sanction decisions of their subordinate organs are inappropriate or incorrect, they should be changed, and the sanctions should be increased, reduced, or revoked, depending on the specific circumstances.

    XI. When state administrative organs sanction any staff member, they should carefully investigate and verify the facts of the errors committed, and make a written conclusion after discussion in a certain meeting. During the discussion, unless there are special circumstances, the person subject to the sanction should be notified to attend and state their opinions. After the disciplinary sanction is decided or approved and takes effect, the person subject to the sanction should be notified in writing, and the sanction should be recorded in their personal file.

    If a staff member of a state administrative organ commits a serious error and is not suitable for holding their current position before a sanction is decided or approved, the higher-level organ or the organ itself may first suspend them from their position.

    XII. If a staff member of a state administrative organ disagrees with the disciplinary sanction they have received, they should, within one month of receiving the notice, request a review from the handling organ and have the right to appeal directly to the higher-level organ. State administrative organs should carefully handle the appeals of those sanctioned. The appeal letters of those sanctioned to the higher-level organ must be forwarded promptly and must not be withheld. However, the execution of the sanction will not be suspended during the review or appeal period.

    XIII. The scope of work of state supervisory organs in managing awards and penalties shall be in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1) When state supervisory organs discover in their work that rewards or disciplinary sanctions should be given to staff members of state administrative organs, they should put forward specific opinions, suggest that their competent organs make a decision, or report to the higher-level administrative organ for a decision.

      (2) State supervisory organs should be responsible for reviewing cases of awards and disciplinary sanctions submitted by higher-level administrative organs for discussion, and put forward specific opinions, and report to the higher-level administrative organ for a decision.

      (3) State supervisory organs may comment on disputes among various departments regarding awards or disciplinary sanctions, and put forward specific opinions, suggest that their competent organs make a decision, or report to the higher-level administrative organ for a decision.

      (4) State supervisory organs may review or re-investigate complaints and appeals regarding awards or disciplinary sanctions that they have accepted, and put forward specific opinions, suggest that their competent organs make a decision, or report to the higher-level administrative organ for a decision.

    XIV. These regulations apply to personnel holding state administrative positions by election of people’s congresses at various local levels, and staff members appointed by state administrative organs at various levels, as well as staff members appointed by state administrative organs in enterprises and institutions.

    XV. Departments of the State Council and people’s committees at various local levels may formulate specific implementation measures based on these regulations.

    The issue of awards and penalties for staff members of institutions affiliated with state administrative organs should be addressed by the competent departments of the State Council by formulating award and penalty measures with reference to these regulations.

    XVI. These regulations shall be interpreted by the Ministry of Supervision.

    XVII. These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.

    The former Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government's "Procedures for Approving Administrative Sanctions for Staff Members of State Organs" and "Provisional Measures on Revoking Administrative Sanctions for Staff Members of State Organs" shall be repealed.
