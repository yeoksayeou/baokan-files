Minority Publication Undertakings are Flourishing
Books and periodicals are published in thirteen minority languages, with over 40 million copies issued in the last four years.
    (Our report) In recent years, with the development of the national socialist construction, and the care of the Party and the state for minority nationalities, the publication undertakings of minority nationalities have developed rapidly.
    Before liberation, the history of old China was a history of national oppression. Although all minority nationalities had their own long history and culture, their cultures were in a long-term backward state due to the national oppression system of the reactionary ruling classes of past dynasties. Many ethnic groups did not have their own writing systems. Even ethnic groups that had their own writing systems did not have the freedom to use their own languages and writing systems because they were discriminated against by the reactionary ruling classes, so there was no possibility of publication undertakings. Taking Tibetan as an example, the Tibetan people had their own writing system from the 7th century, but until the peaceful liberation of Tibet, it was still at the stage of woodblock printing, and there were no letterpress publications in Lhasa. The Mongolian, Uyghur, and Kazakh ethnic groups were also discriminated against by the reactionary ruling classes, and rarely had their own publications. In the northeast, the Korean ethnic group was not only forbidden to use the Korean language during the Japanese imperialist rule, but even had no freedom to speak their own language.
    In recent years, the Party and the state have vigorously helped all minority nationalities to develop cultural publication undertakings, which has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of all nationalities to learn culture. Under the leadership and assistance of the Party and the government, the publication undertakings of minority nationalities have flourished. From liberation to the present, various books and periodicals have been published in thirteen minority languages, including Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, Korean, Zhuang, Yi, Dai Le, Dai Na, Xibe, Kirgiz, Jingpo, and Lisu. At present, there are 22 kinds of newspapers and 33 kinds of magazines in various minority languages in the country. From 1952 to 1956, a total of 4,988 kinds of books in minority languages were published, with a total circulation of 46,598,000 copies. During the same period, the total circulation of newspapers was more than 110.8 million copies; the total circulation of magazines was more than 11 million copies. At present, 12 minority language publishing institutions have been established across the country.
    In order to help the development of publishing undertakings of all nationalities, the Central Nationalities Publishing House was established in Beijing in January 1953. It mainly undertakes the translation and publication of state policy documents, Marxist-Leninist classics and other political books, and the publication of books that are difficult to publish locally due to insufficient conditions.
    In recent years, the state has allocated a large amount of money to subsidize minority publication undertakings. The prices of books and periodicals in minority languages are the lowest among books and periodicals in our country. For example, the Chinese version of the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China" (hardcover) has 84 pages and is worth two yuan, while the ethnic language version, such as the Tibetan version, has 222 pages and is worth 1.10 yuan. "National Pictorial" is published in six languages: Chinese, Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Korean, and is priced at 25 cents per copy, which is the lowest-priced pictorial in China.
    In order to help minority nationalities develop their own cultural publication undertakings, the Party and the People's Government have absorbed a large number of minority intellectuals into translation and compilation work in recent years. In 1956, they helped the Zhuang, Yi, Lisu and Jingpo nationalities to create new writing systems; and organized a large number of linguists to conduct language surveys in minority areas, and proposed new writing system plans for ethnic groups without their own writing systems. Undoubtedly, this will lead the cultural publication undertakings of all nationalities to new prosperity and climax. (Attached picture)
    More than 6 million Zhuang people already have newspapers printed in their own language - the Zhuang language newspaper. The "Zhuang Language Newspaper" is a weekly, and it is distributed in the vast rural areas of Guangxi. The 350,000 Zhuang farmers who are now learning the Zhuang language can directly learn about national affairs from the newspaper.

### 少数民族出版事业日益繁荣  用十三种民族文字出版书刊，四年来发行图书四千多万册

　　少数民族出版事业日益繁荣
    用十三种民族文字出版书刊，四年来发行图书四千多万册
    本报讯　几年来，随着全国社会主义建设事业的发展，以及党和国家对少数民族的关怀，少数民族的出版事业发展很快。
    解放前，旧中国的历史是民族压迫的历史，各少数民族虽然都有着自己悠久的历史和文化，但由于历代的反动统治阶级的民族压迫制度，使他们的文化长期的处在落后状态。许多个民族没有自己的文字，即使有本民族文字的民族，因为受到反动统治阶级的歧视，没有使用本民族语言文字的自由，就更谈不到出版事业了。就以藏文来说，从七世纪开始，藏族就有了自己的文字，但直到西藏和平解放为止，还停留在木版印刷阶段，在拉萨还没有铅印的出版物。蒙古、维吾尔、哈萨克等民族也同样受到反动统治阶级的歧视，很少有自己的出版物。东北地区的朝鲜族，在日本帝国主义统治的年代里，不仅朝鲜文字被禁止使用，连说自己民族的语言都没有自由。
    几年来，党和国家大力帮助各少数民族发展文化出版事业，对各民族人民学习文化的热情起了极大的鼓舞作用。少数民族的出版事业，在党和政府的领导和帮助下蓬勃发展起来。从解放到目前为止，全国已有用蒙、藏、维、哈、朝、僮、彝、傣仂、傣讷、锡伯、柯尔克孜、景颇、傈僳等十三种民族文字出版的各种图书和报刊。现在全国有各种少数民族文字的报纸二十二种，杂志三十三种。从1952年到1956年，全国共出版少数民族文字的图书四千九百八十八种，共发行四千六百五十九万八千多册。在同一时期，报纸发行总数为一万一千零八十多万份；杂志发行总数为一千一百多万份。目前，全国已建立少数民族语文出版机构十二处。
    为了帮助各民族出版事业的发展，1953年1月在北京建立了中央民族出版社。它主要担负着翻译出版国家的政策文件、马列主义经典著作等政治书籍和出版地方上因条件不足而出版有困难的图书等。
    几年来，国家拨出大批款子贴补少数民族出版事业。少数民族文字的书刊价格在我国书刊中是最低的。如“中华人民共和国宪法”（精装本）汉文版八十四页，价值两元，民族文字版如藏文版二百二十二页，价值一元一角。“民族画报”用汉、蒙、藏、维吾尔、哈萨克和朝鲜文六种文字出版，每册定价为两角五分，是我国价格最低的一种画报。
    党和人民政府为了帮助少数民族发展本民族的文化出版事业，几年来各有关部门吸收了大批少数民族知识分子，参加翻译和编纂工作。1956年帮助僮、彝、傈僳和景颇等民族创制出新文字；并且组织了大批语言学家到少数民族地区进行语言调查工作，为没有自己文字的民族提出创制新文字方案。无疑的这将使各民族语文的文化出版事业走向新的繁荣和高潮。（附图片）
    六百多万僮族人民已经有了本民族文字印成的报纸——僮文报。“僮文报”是周刊，它发行在广西广大的乡村中，现在正在学习僮文的三十五万僮族农民，就可以直接在报纸上得知国家大事了。
