Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd - According to materials recently published in "Pravda," Soviet agriculture, after realizing collectivization and mechanization, has greatly increased its commodity products compared to pre-October Revolution times. This has allowed urban residents to obtain more grain and other food products than ever before, and industry to obtain more raw materials.

In 1956, the Soviet Union's commodity grain reached 3.738 billion poods (each pood equals 32.76 jin), almost triple the amount in 1913, the most abundant year before the October Revolution. The most valuable grain, wheat, increased from 515 million poods in 1913 to 2.549 billion poods.

Commodity grain has increased most rapidly in recent years, mainly due to the reclamation of large amounts of wasteland in the eastern regions. In 1953, the state requisitioned and purchased approximately 1.9 billion poods of grain, while in 1956, this increased to over 3.3 billion poods. Before large-scale reclamation, regions such as Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Urals only sold about 600 million poods of commodity grain to the state annually. In 1956, this rose to over 2.1 billion poods.

The commodity output of livestock products, vegetables, and potatoes has also greatly increased. The commodity output of meat and various animal fats has increased from 3.4 million tons in 1913 to 6.2 million tons last year; milk and dairy products increased from 7 million tons to 20.4 million tons; vegetables and potatoes increased from 1.1 million tons and 6.1 million tons to 6.9 million tons and 16.7 million tons, respectively.

Due to the increase in commodity livestock products, state-owned stores and cooperatives sold 1.9 times more meat products to residents last year than in 1932, 7.7 times more animal fats, and 7.8 times more milk and dairy products.

Socialist agriculture provides more and more raw materials for industry. In 1956, the commodity output of cotton increased from 740,000 tons before the October Revolution to 4.33 million tons, sugar beets increased from 11.3 million tons to 31.5 million tons, various types of wool increased from 77,000 tons to 223,000 tons, and sunflower seeds increased from 430,000 tons to 2.86 million tons.

Before the October Revolution, Russia imported more than half of the cotton needed for its textile industry from abroad. Now, Soviet cotton is fully capable of guaranteeing the needs of the textile industry. In 1913, Russia produced approximately 2.85 billion meters of textiles, while the Soviet Union produced approximately 6.86 billion meters of textiles last year. Sugar production also increased from 1.347 million tons before the revolution to 4.354 million tons last year.

Due to the increase in commodity output of agricultural products, the income of collective farmers has also greatly increased. In 1956, the income of Soviet collective farms and collective farmers from selling agricultural products increased by 54 billion rubles compared to 1952, and by 20 billion rubles compared to 1955.

This newspaper's Moscow dispatch on the 23rd - Soviet cotton production has undergone astonishing development in forty years. In 1913, the Soviet Union's cotton sown area was only 690,000 hectares, with a total output of 742,000 tons and an average yield of 1,080 kilograms per hectare. In 1956, the sown area increased to 2.07 million hectares, with a total output of 4.331 million tons and an average yield of more than 2,100 kilograms per hectare. In terms of cotton production, the Soviet Union ranks third in the world; in terms of cotton yield per unit area, the Soviet Union ranks first in the world. The cotton produced by the Soviet Union now not only meets the needs of the domestic textile industry and other national economic sectors, but also exports some abroad.

Comparing 1956 with 1913, the Soviet Union's total cotton output increased approximately sixfold. However, in 1922, after the domestic war, the total cotton output had fallen to 23,000 tons, and the yield per unit area had fallen to 300 kilograms per hectare. This was the starting point for the development of Soviet cotton production. Comparing 1956 with 1922, the total cotton output increased approximately nineteenfold!

Due to the social reform of land and water, as well as other measures to increase production, Soviet cotton production had already recovered to the 1913 level by 1928. But at that time, 40% of the raw materials for the textile industry still had to be imported from abroad. The collectivization and mechanization of agriculture, and the revitalization of water conservancy projects, opened up broad prospects for Soviet cotton production. Many cotton fields in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus have greatly increased their yields due to irrigation.

In recent years, due to the formulation of production plans from the bottom up and the expansion of the powers of the republics, due to the increase in cotton procurement prices and the improvement of bonus methods, due to the reduction of tractor station labor compensation and chemical fertilizer prices, and the fact that the use of water from national irrigation systems does not require payment, due to the promotion of advanced technologies such as narrow-row dense planting and square-hole planting, cotton production has increased significantly. Last year, the cotton yield per hectare in the entire Uzbekistan increased by 300 kilograms.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, approximately one million hectares of wasteland will be reclaimed and irrigated in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus. The most important thing is to reclaim and irrigate the "Hungry Steppe," which will produce 320,000 to 340,000 tons of cotton annually.

The agricultural laborers in the Soviet Union who grow cotton live a prosperous life. Taking Uzbekistan as an example, the cash income of this republic's collective farms reached 10.4 billion rubles last year, five times that of 1940; public accumulation funds reached 8.4 billion rubles. In the formerly impoverished countryside before the revolution, beautiful houses, schools, and clubs have been built everywhere. Even remote villages have electric lights, telephones, and radio broadcasts.

Soviet collective farm members Zhumayeva and Mavyanova said in the cotton fields: "Our cotton is of such good quality!"

    供给居民更多食品　供给工业更多原料
    苏联农业商品产量与年俱增
    棉花单位面积产量占世界第一位
    新华社莫斯科22日电　据“真理报”最近发表的材料，苏联农业在实现了集体化和机械化之后，商品产品比十月革命前大大增加。这就使城市居民得到了比以往更多的粮食和其他食品，工业得到了更多的原料。
    1956年，苏联的商品谷物达到了三十七亿三千八百万普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤），几乎等于十月革命前最丰收的年份1913年的三倍。其中最宝贵的谷物——小麦则从1913年的五亿一千五百万普特增加到二十五亿四千九百万普特。
    商品谷物增加得最快的是在最近几年。这主要是由于在东部地区开垦了大量的荒地。1953年，国家征购和收购的谷物约有十九亿普特，而1956年就增加到三十三亿普特以上。哈萨克、西伯利亚和乌拉尔等地区在大规模开垦以前，每年交售给国家的商品谷物只有六亿普特左右。而在1956年就上升到二十一亿普特以上。
    畜产品、蔬菜和马铃薯的商品产量也大大增加了。肉类和各种动物油脂的商品产量已经从1913年的三百四十万吨增加到去年的六百二十万吨；奶和奶制品从七百万吨增加到二千零四十万吨；蔬菜和马铃薯分别从一百一十万吨和六百一十万吨增加到六百九十万吨和一千六百七十万吨。
    由于商品畜产品的增加，去年国营商店和合作社出售给居民的肉类制品已经比1932年增加了一点九倍，动物油脂增加了七点七倍，奶和奶制品增加了七点八倍。
    社会主义农业为工业提供了越来越多的原料。1956年，棉花的商品产量由十月革命前的七十四万吨增加到四百三十三万吨，甜菜由一千一百三十万吨增加到三千一百五十万吨，各种羊毛由七万七千吨增加到二十二万三千吨，向日葵籽由四十三万吨增加到二百八十六万吨。
    十月革命前，俄国纺织业需要的棉花有一半以上从国外进口，现在，苏联棉花已经完全能够保证纺织业的需要。1913年，俄国生产的纺织品为二十八亿五千万公尺左右，而苏联在去年就生产了六十八亿六千万公尺左右的纺织品。砂糖产量也从革命前的一百三十四万七千吨增加到去年的四百三十五万四千吨。
    由于农产品的商品产量增加，集体农民的收入也大大增加。1956年，苏联集体农庄和集体农民交售农产品的收入比1952年增加了五百四十亿卢布，比1955年增加了二百亿卢布。
    本报莫斯科23日电　苏联棉花生产在四十年中有惊人的发展。1913年，苏联棉花播种面积仅六十九万公顷，总产量七十四万二千吨，每公顷平均收获量一千零八公斤；1956年，播种面积增加到二百零七万公顷，总产量四百三十三万一千吨，每公顷平均收获量二千一百多公斤。按棉花产量来说，苏联占世界第三位；按棉花单位面积产量来说，苏联占世界第一位。苏联现在生产的棉花，不但能够满足国内纺织工业及其他国民经济部门的需要，而且有一部分输出国外。
    以1956年比1913年，苏联棉花总产量增长约六倍。但是，在国内战争之后的1922年，棉花总产量曾经降低到二万三千吨，单位面积产量曾经降低到每公顷三百公斤，这是苏联棉花生产发展的起点。以1956年和1922年比较，棉花总产量增长约十九倍！
    由于土地和水的社会改革以及其他增进生产的措施，苏联在1928年棉花生产已经恢复到1913年水平。但那时纺织业的40％原料还得由国外输入。农业的集体化和机械化，水利工程的振兴，给苏联棉花生产打开了广阔的天地。中亚和外高加索的许多棉田，因为引水灌溉而大大增产。
    最近几年，由于从下而上的制订生产计划和共和国权力的扩大，由于棉花征购价格的提高和奖金办法的改进，由于拖拉机站工作报酬和化学肥料价格的降低，以及利用国家灌溉系统的水不必付偿，由于窄距密植和方形穴种的先进技术的推广，棉花产量显著上升。去年整个乌兹别克斯坦的棉花产量每公顷增加了三百公斤。
    在第六个五年计划时期，在中亚和外高加索还要开垦和灌溉约一百万公顷荒地。最主要的是开垦和灌溉“饥饿草原”，那里每年将出产三十二万到三十四万吨棉花。
    苏联种棉的农业劳动者过着富裕的生活。以乌兹别克斯坦为例，这个共和国集体农庄的现金收入去年达到一百零四亿卢布，为1940年的五倍；公积金达到八十四亿卢布。在革命前贫困的农村，现在普遍建设了漂亮的住宅、学校、俱乐部，连偏僻的村落都有电灯、电话和无线电广播。
    苏联集体农庄庄员朱玛耶娃和玛维扬诺娃在棉田里说：“我们的棉花的质量多么好呀！”
