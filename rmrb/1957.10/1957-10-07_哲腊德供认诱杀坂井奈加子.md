Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th – The Maebashi District Court in Japan continued to hear the case of American soldier Jerrard killing Japanese woman Sakai Nakako on October 3rd, 4th, and 5th.

    Naker, who was on duty with Jerrard at the time, testified again in court on the 5th that Jerrard was not actually on guard duty when he shot Sakai Nakako, and that the shooting occurred during a ten-minute break. Naker said that before shooting Sakai Nakako, Jerrard had fired at other Japanese people picking up shell casings at the Sōmagahara training ground about three times, but did not hit them. Several Japanese people who were shot at also testified to this in court on the 4th.

    Naker reiterated how Jerrard told him to throw out shell casings to lure Sakai Nakako. Jerrard also inadvertently admitted in court on the 5th that he lured Sakai to pick up shell casings and then killed her "as a joke." When the judge asked Jerrard if Naker's testimony was incorrect, Jerrard admitted that the testimony was accurate.

    哲腊德供认诱杀坂井奈加子
    据新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本前桥地方裁判所10月3日、4日和5日继续审理美国兵哲腊德杀害日本妇女坂井奈加子的案件。
    当时同哲腊德一道值勤的奈克尔5日再次在法庭上作证时说，哲腊德在打死坂井奈加子的时候，事实上并没有守卫的任务，打死坂井的事件是在十分钟的休息时间内发生的。奈克尔说，哲腊德在打死坂井奈加子以前，还对其它几个在相马原演习场拾取弹壳的日本人大约开过三次枪，只是没有打中他们。遭到射击的几个日本人4日也在法庭上证明了这一点。
    奈克尔再次叙述了哲腊德叫他投出弹壳引诱坂井奈加子的情况。哲腊德5日也在法庭上无意中承认了他引诱坂井拾取弹壳，然后“为了开玩笑”打死了她。当时法官问哲腊德，奈克尔的证辞有无错误，哲腊德承认证辞无误。
