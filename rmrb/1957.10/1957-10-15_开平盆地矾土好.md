    Kaiping Basin Bauxite is Good
    Since February of this year, the staff of the 505 Exploration Team of the North China Branch of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have been conducting exploration on the northern edge of the Kaiping Basin. Based on the data obtained from trench exploration, well exploration, and drilling over the past seven months, it is confirmed that the Tangshan area possesses rich bauxite deposits.
    The explored area contains hard clay, semi-soft clay, and soft clay. Chemical tests have proven that the alumina content of the general bauxite is very high, making it one of the rare high-alumina bauxites in the world. According to geological personnel's analysis, the bauxite in this area can not only be made into high-grade refractory bricks and general refractory materials required by the metallurgical industry, but also the bauxite with higher aluminum content can be used to smelt aluminum. Semi-soft clay and soft clay are the main raw materials for manufacturing architectural porcelain, electromagnetic porcelain, and household daily-use porcelain.

    开平盆地矾土好
    冶金工业部地质局华北分局五零五勘探队的职工们，从今年2月起，在开平盆地北部边缘上进行了勘探。根据七个月来槽探、井探和钻探取得的资料，肯定唐山地区拥有丰富的矾土矿藏。
    已经探明的范围内有硬质粘土、半软质粘土、软质粘土等。经过化验证明，一般矾土含三氧化二铝都很高，是世界上少有的高铝矾土。据地质人员化验分析，这个地区的矾土不仅能制成冶金工业所需的高级耐火砖和一般耐火材料，含铝较高的矾土还能冶炼铝。半软质粘土和软质粘土是制造建筑磁、电磁、家庭日用磁的主要原料。
