    Rural Maternity Hospital
    Xinhua News Agency: A rural maternity hospital has been established in Yongsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Leping County, Jiangxi Province.
    This maternity hospital has five beds and is staffed by three midwives from the township. The maternity hospital uses scientific methods for the care of mothers and infants.
    On the first day of the maternity hospital's establishment, Zhang Jin'e, a pregnant woman from Yongsheng Village, came to be hospitalized. She had previously fainted due to excessive bleeding during childbirth. This time, thanks to the careful care of the maternity hospital, both mother and child were safe and sound. She said, "It's safe for both mother and child to give birth in the hospital, and it doesn't delay the husband's production."
    In the past, pregnant women in rural areas gave birth at home, which could not guarantee the necessary postpartum rest, and required someone to take care of them, affecting the cooperative's production. This maternity hospital was established according to the urgent needs of the cooperative members. Most of the equipment in the hospital was borrowed from cooperative members, and money was also allocated from the cooperative members' welfare fund for expenses. Therefore, the maternity hospital charges very little for delivery and hospitalization. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    农村产院
    江西省乐平县涌山农业社成立了一所农村产院。
    这所产院有五张床位，由乡里的三个接生员驻院接生。产院对产妇和婴儿的护理，采用科学的方法。
    产院成立的第一天，涌山村的产妇章金娥来住院，她过去在分娩时曾因出血过多而晕厥过去；这次由于产院的细心护理，母子都很平安。她说：“住院生孩子母子平安，也不耽误丈夫的生产。”
    过去农村孕妇在家分娩，不能保证必要的产后休养，并且还要人照顾，影响社里的生产。这座产院就是根据社员的迫切要求而成立的。院内用具大部分是社员借给的，还从社员福利金里拨了钱做经费，因此，产院收取的接生费和住院费都很少。　（据新华社讯）
