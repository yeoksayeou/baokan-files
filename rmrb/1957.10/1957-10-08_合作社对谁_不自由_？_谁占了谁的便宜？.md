Who is the Cooperative "Unfree" To? Who is Taking Advantage of Whom?
　　When the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, was conducting a debate on the two roads, some people said that joining the cooperative was not free. Is it really unfree? Everyone believes that the cooperative is indeed unfree to those wealthy peasants with serious capitalist ideas. Cooperative member Han Yutian said: "The cooperative does not allow people to take the capitalist road, that is unfree, that is one; not working hard and being criticized is also unfree, that is two; third, the cooperative pays according to work, and you can't just work whenever you feel like it, that is also unfree." He raised his voice and said: These "unfreedoms" are more free than paradise for us lower-middle and poor peasants! We don't feel any unfreedom in the cooperative. Like when I got a boil on my butt, the cooperative let me rest and recuperate without worrying about the crops being wasted."
　　During the debate, some people also said: "Running a cooperative is beneficial to those with more labor and less land, and not worthwhile for households with less labor and more land." This argument was also refuted. Everyone believed that the land itself can only grow weeds, and only through labor such as plowing, planting, weeding, irrigating, and fertilizing can grain grow. Cooperative members also compared the 580 jin of early rice harvested from the 1.8 mu of land planted by individual farmer Wang Zhanggen with the more than 1,400 jin of early rice harvested from the 2.6 mu of land planted by the cooperative, indicating that the average yield per mu of the cooperative was 219 jin more than Wang Zhanggen's. This shows that those with more land and less labor use less labor on the land, resulting in lower yields. If they hire labor, the yield will be higher, but this is exploitation. Even Wang Zhanggen admitted this reasoning and wrote an application to join the cooperative.

    合作社对谁“不自由”？  谁占了谁的便宜？
    浙江嵊县幸福农业社在进行两条道路辩论时，有人说参加合作社不自由。到底自由不自由呢？大家都认为，合作社对那些富裕农民中资本主义思想严重的人确实不自由。社员韩雨田说：“合作社不让人走资本主义道路不自由，这是一；不好好干活，受批评，也不自由，这是二；第三，合作社按劳取酬了，不能凭自己的高兴爱干活就干，这也是不自由。”他提高了嗓子说：这些“不自由”对我们下中农和贫农来说比天堂还自由！我们在社里就没有感到什么不自由，像我屁股上生了颗疔疮，合作社就让我安心养病，不用愁庄稼荒了。
    辩论中还有人说：办合作社是劳力多土地少的人占便宜，劳力少土地多的户就不合算。”这种论调也遭到了反驳，大家认为土地的本身只能生长杂草，只有经过耕、种、耘耥、灌水、施肥等的劳动才能长出粮食来。社员们还拿单干户王章根种的一亩八分地收早稻谷五百八十斤和合作社种二亩六分地收早稻一千四百多斤相比，说明合作社的产量平均每亩要比王章根多收二百十九斤的稻谷。这说明土地多劳力少的在土地上用工少产量也就低，如果雇工，产量就高，但这是剥削行为。这个道理连王章根也承认了，并且写了申请书要求参加合作社。
