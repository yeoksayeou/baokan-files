    Celebrating the Eighth Anniversary of the National Day
    The Dalai Lama Sends a Telegram to Chairman Mao

    Respected Chairman Mao:

    As the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country celebrate the grand commemoration of the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with unparalleled joy, I would like to extend my highest respect and congratulations to you.

    Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader – you, our country, after achieving a great revolutionary victory nationwide, began the work of national economic recovery and successfully completed the great movement of various transformations. Especially last year, most parts of the country completed the socialist transformation, which greatly increased productivity, and political, economic, and cultural aspects have been developed, and the people's living standards have also been improved. This year, our country will certainly be able to over fulfill the first Five-Year Plan. I would like to express my warm congratulations on these great achievements in all aspects with infinite joy and encouragement.

    The central government's decision to "not change for six years" in the Tibet region is a correct policy that fully conforms to the specific conditions of Tibet. These principles have been publicized and educated to the Tibetan people, making them understand its positive significance. At the same time, the streamlining and reorganization of the huge institutions and excessive staff have been completed. In the future, we must continue to strengthen unity among all parties, improve the level of anti-imperialist and patriotic ideology, study hard, promote gradual progress, and make unremitting efforts to encourage the successful completion of all aspects of work. Finally, I wish you good health.
                                                                                                     Dalai Lama

    庆祝国庆八周年
    达赖喇嘛致电毛主席敬爱的毛主席：
    当全国各民族人民以无比欢欣的心情，为中华人民共和国成立八周年举行盛大纪念的时候，我谨向您致以崇高的赞礼，并表示庆祝。
    在中国共产党和伟大领袖——您的正确领导下，我国在全国范围内获得伟大的革命胜利之后，即开始了国民经济恢复工作并胜利地完成了各种改造的伟大运动。特别在去年，全国大部分地区都完成了社会主义改造，从而使生产力大大提高了，政治、经济、文化等方面都得到发展，人民的生活水平也得到提高。今年，我国肯定能够超额完成第一个五年计划。对这些各方面的伟大成就，我谨以无限欢欣鼓舞的心情，致以热烈的庆贺。
    中央决定在西藏地区“六年不改”，这是完全符合西藏具体情况的正确方针。这些道理已向西藏人民进行宣传教育，使他们明白了它的积极意义。同时，对庞大的机构和过多的工作人员，已完成了精简整编工作。今后我们还必须继续加强各方面之间的团结，提高反帝爱国思想水平，努力学习，促使逐渐进步，并将为鼓励圆满完成各方面的工作而作不懈的努力。最后，祝愿您身体健康。      达赖喇嘛
