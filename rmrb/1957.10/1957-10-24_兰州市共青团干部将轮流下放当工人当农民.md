    兰州市共青团干部将轮流下放当工人当农民
    新华社兰州22日电　共青团兰州市委会现有的六十二名市、区级干部，将从今年开始在六年内轮流下放到工厂和农村参加一年到二年的体力劳动。这是共青团兰州市委最近关于分期分批组织干部参加体力劳动的计划中规定的。
    第一批下乡下厂参加劳动的十六名青年工作干部将在最近出发，其中包括共青团兰州市委副书记魏国璋、学生工作部部长吴忠懿、青工部副部长张希佐和兰州市民主青年联合会副秘书长乔培义等。兰州市的青年团干部和学生最近为他们举行了欢送大会。他们将要去的工厂的厂长和农业社主任也来参加了大会，对他们的下乡下厂表示欢迎。
    共青团兰州市委会还规定，暂且没有下放的干部每季度也要以十天到十五天的时间，到工厂、农村参加体力劳动，每周还要另外抽出半天时间去工厂、农村参加体力劳动或其他公益劳动；临时下到基层工作的干部，也要和工人、农民一起参加一定的劳动。
