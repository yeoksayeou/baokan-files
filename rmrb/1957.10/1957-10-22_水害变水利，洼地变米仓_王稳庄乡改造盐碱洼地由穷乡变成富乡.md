Editor's Note: Under the current conditions, water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation are two decisive tasks for accelerating the development of agricultural production in our country. At present, thousands upon thousands of farmers are enthusiastically responding to the great call of the Party Central Committee, carrying out farmland water conservancy construction and launching fertilizer accumulation activities with extremely high labor enthusiasm. A massive production upsurge, mainly focused on farmland water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, is arriving across the country.

Hebei Province recently convened a representative meeting of activists in water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, extensively exchanging the valuable experiences created by farmers throughout the province in farmland water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. These experiences, along with those from all over the country, vividly demonstrate that as long as farmland water conservancy construction is actively carried out in accordance with local conditions and a large amount of fertilizer is accumulated, the backwardness and poverty of barren mountainous areas, dry and arid sandy areas, or easily flooded low-lying areas, and infertile saline-alkali areas can be quickly changed.

Today, this newspaper introduces some of the experiences created by farmers in Hebei Province in farmland water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, for reference in various localities.

Turning Water Calamity into Water Conservancy, Turning Low-lying Land into Granaries
—Wangwenzhuang Township Transforms Saline-Alkali Lowlands from a Poor Township to a Prosperous Township

Amazing Changes

Wangwenzhuang Township, Jinghai County, Tianjin Special District, Hebei Province, is close to the Bohai Sea and has a low-lying terrain. The township has over 100,000 mu of saline-alkali land, of which only more than 20,000 mu were cultivated before liberation, growing wheat and sorghum, with very low yields per unit area. In 1948, the average yield was only about 50 jin of grain per mu. The vast majority of farmers here lived a poor life of "eating bran and vegetable meals, and drinking alfalfa soup." Deaths from starvation and fleeing to other places to escape famine occurred every year in the villages before liberation. In the three or four years after liberation, although land reform was carried out and the cultivated area was gradually expanded to more than 28,000 mu, the grain yield increased to 3 million jin in 1952, but it was still not enough to eat. In addition to the state issuing relief funds and livelihood loans of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan annually to help the masses overcome famine, it also had to transfer 2 to 3 million jin of grain from other places every year. From 1953 to 1955, some farmers organized mutual aid teams and elementary agricultural production cooperatives, continuing to expand the cultivated area, diverting water to grow more than 1,000 mu of rice, and also irrigating some wheat, which increased grain production to some extent. However, the township still lacked 1.5 million jin of grain in 1954 and 800,000 jin in 1955.

In the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956, during the high tide of cooperativization, the township established an advanced agricultural production cooperative with more than 2,400 households and more than 13,000 people, named the "Fumin (Enrich the People)" Agricultural Production Cooperative. This cooperative made unified plans, constructed water conservancy projects according to local conditions, expanded the cultivated area to more than 35,000 mu, of which more than 22,000 mu were planted with rice. In 1956, the total grain output of the cooperative reached 12.2 million jin, with an average yield of more than 340 jin per mu. The township not only did not need the state to supply grain, but also sold 5 million jin of grain to the state. In the winter of 1956 and the spring of 1957, the Fumin Agricultural Cooperative expanded the scale of water conservancy construction, excavating a total of 1.2 million cubic meters of earth, building three main canals, fifty-five branch canals, more than 7,000 capillary canals, one control gate, and fifty-five small water gates, diverting fresh water from the Machang Jian River to flush the saline-alkali land, drain the salt water, and then irrigate with fresh water, expanding the cultivated area to more than 40,000 mu, planting more than 30,000 mu of rice. Although there was a drought this year and the freshwater source was greatly limited, which affected the growth of crops to a certain extent, it is estimated that the township can still harvest more than 16 million jin of grain this year, with an average yield of nearly 400 jin per mu.

A poor township has become a prosperous township. In the words of the local farmers, this change is simply "a leap to the sky"! Why did this change occur? The members of the cooperative are very clear: the key lies in the fact that after cooperativization, everyone worked together to build water conservancy projects according to local conditions, gradually turning saline-alkali lowlands into fertile land, and changing to rice cultivation.

Opening canals and planting rice was originally the long-cherished wish of many farmers in the area. Before liberation, this wish could only be a fantasy. In the early days after liberation, Wangwenzhuang and other villages repeatedly joined forces, attempting to dig a river to divert fresh water to grow rice on a large scale, but due to the weakness of individual farming and the serious contradictions between villages, even the problem of land occupation for the riverbed was difficult to solve. After much effort, a winding channel was surveyed, but with numerous obstacles, it was never completed.

In the winter of 1955, after the establishment of an advanced agricultural production cooperative in the township, the problem of land occupation for channels and the problem of labor allocation were solved smoothly. Under the leadership of the higher authorities and the township Party committee, the cooperative established a Lowland Transformation Committee, convened veteran farmers and production team leaders for several symposiums, and conducted investigations and studies in the lowlands, formulating a draft plan for transforming the lowlands and changing to rice cultivation. After being discussed and revised by the members of each production team, it was discussed and approved by a meeting of cooperative member representatives, and large-scale water conservancy construction began.

In the measurement of channels and the construction of gates and other engineering technologies, the Fumin Agricultural Cooperative encountered many difficult problems. The township Party committee adopted the method of mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions and plans, learning while doing, and the difficulties were overcome one by one. When measuring the channel line, they learned the method of finding a straight line from the workers who planted telephone poles. They also organized experienced veteran farmers to survey the water potential, water volume, and water flow while calculating the width and depth of the channel, and then discussed and determined it. As a result, the constructed diversion channels and drainage channels are basically smooth and usable.

Building Water Conservancy Projects with Local Materials

At the beginning, some cooperative members hoped to obtain loans from the state to fund water conservancy construction. The township Party committee educated everyone to resolutely implement the principle of diligence and frugality in running affairs, requiring everyone to find ways to do things well without spending money or spending as little money as possible. For the construction of a control gate, fifty-five small gates, and four bridges, they originally planned to use stones, bricks, cement, or lime, requiring an investment of 32,000 yuan. After mobilizing the masses to come up with ideas, they used broken stone rollers as the foundation, used reeds and clay to make earth dikes instead of stone and bricks, and then used some old wood to make gate doors and bridges, completing the gates and bridges. The cost of materials was only 3,400 yuan. Such gates and bridges are still very strong to this day. The cooperative members said happily, "We have plenty of reeds and clay, and we also have plenty of strength. If the earth dike is damaged, we can replace it, and we don't need to spend much money to get things done."

Their cash investment in water conservancy was spent in the most necessary places, such as buying boiler-powered pumps, etc.

In expanding rice fields and changing to rice cultivation, one of their biggest difficulties was that many people did not know how to transplant rice seedlings. However, they found more than 300 experienced rice transplanters and assigned them to various production teams, using basins, dustpans, and water pits as rice paddies, and using grass instead of seedlings to train new transplanters. After diligent study and practice by the cooperative members, more than 2,000 people learned the skill of transplanting rice seedlings in one month, ensuring the smooth completion of this spring's rice transplanting task. More than 30 cooperative members in the cooperative also learned the technology of using and repairing machines such as boiler-powered pumps. They also cultivated a group of technical personnel in surveying channels, building gates, building bridges, and building culverts.

In the spring of 1957, the Fumin Agricultural Cooperative's water conservancy project required the excavation of more than 1 million cubic meters of earth, and they also had to cultivate more than 30,000 mu of rice paddies. How to allocate labor to ensure that both canal excavation and rice planting did not delay the farming season? This was a major issue. The cooperative proposed the call to "mobilize strong laborers to excavate canals, experienced veteran farmers to cultivate land and transplant rice seedlings, and women to dig the soil." After deliberation and discussion by the cooperative members, a relatively reasonable method of evaluating work points for excavating various channels and cultivating various lands under different terrain conditions was determined based on the difficulty of the work; and the tasks of canal excavation and land cultivation and rice transplanting were reasonably assigned to each production team by section and by piece, with each team contracting the work and output, and extra rewards were given for exceeding the quota. Labor competitions were also launched between production teams, between groups, and between cooperative members. In this way, all the men, women, old, and young people in the township, and all the full and half laborers, were mobilized for water conservancy projects and spring farming production tasks, and the labor efficiency was greatly improved compared with the past, which ensured the timely and quantitative completion of water conservancy projects and spring farming production tasks. The newly opened channels also met the need for water for transplanting seedlings in more than 30,000 mu of rice land.

Due to the increase in agricultural production, the foundation of the Fumin Agricultural Cooperative has also become stronger, and the cooperative members have gradually become wealthier. In terms of public property, in 1956, the cooperative had production materials such as machines, waterwheels, livestock, and carts worth more than 500,000 yuan. At the end of the 1956 year-end distribution, the average income from agricultural and sideline production for the entire cooperative was nearly 100 yuan per person, excluding the income from sideline production of each production team and the income from sideline production of cooperative member families. According to the cooperative's estimate, the entire cooperative can harvest more than 16 million jin of grain this year. Selling 3.8 million jin of grain to the state, an average of more than 60 yuan per person can be distributed from the proceeds of selling grain. In addition to leaving feed and seeds, the remaining grain averages more than 400 jin per cooperative member. And the income from the cooperative's sideline production, the income from the production teams, and the income from the cooperative member families are not included in the calculation.

Now, every household in Wangwenzhuang Township regularly eats rice. People also dress more neatly than before, and many people use raincoats, raincloth, and rubber shoes for rain protection instead of straw raincoats and hats. In terms of housing, more than 4,200 newly built and renovated houses with earth brick construction, glass windows, and painted door frames were built last winter and this spring alone; and many people are preparing to add or renovate houses this winter and next spring. Due to the increase in production and the gradual enrichment of life, the original old bachelors have also married one after another. People who used to wander outside to make a living have also moved back to settle down and start a business. This autumn, more than forty junior and senior high school graduates from Tianjin City have come to this township to participate in the agricultural production cooperative.

The members of the Fumin Agricultural Cooperative are also preparing to continue to expand the scale of water conservancy construction, continue to expand the cultivated area and the rice planting area. This winter and next spring, they will carry out another 420,000 cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects, reclaim 10,000 mu of saline-alkali wasteland, expand the rice land to 50,000 mu, and pay attention to accumulating and applying fertilizer, increasing the unit area yield in 1958 to an average of more than 500 jin per mu, so that the total grain output of the township will reach 27 million jin next year. They plan to sell 10 million jin of marketable grain to the state next year. They have now opened a 50-mu nursery to cultivate tree seedlings, and plan to plant trees along the edges of villages, roadsides, and channel sides. They also plan to cultivate 15,000 mu of reeds and expand sideline businesses such as pig farming and fish farming.

    编者按　在目前条件下，水利和积肥是加速我国农业生产发展的具有决定意义的两项工作。现在，千千万万的农民正热烈地响应党中央的伟大号召，以极其高涨的劳动积极性进行农田水利建设和展开积肥活动。在全国范围内，一个以农田水利和积肥为主要内容的声势浩大的生产高潮，正在到来。
    河北省最近召开了水利、积肥积极分子代表会议，广泛地交流了全省农民在农田水利建设和积肥方面所创造的宝贵经验。这些经验和全国各地的经验都生动地证明了，只要因地制宜地积极地进行农田水利建设和大量积肥，不论是贫瘠的山区、干燥苦旱的风沙地区、或者是易涝的低洼地区、不毛的盐碱地区，都可以很快地改变低产和贫困的面貌。
    本报今天介绍的是河北省农民在农田水利建设和积肥方面所创造的一部分经验，这些经验供各地参考。
    水害变水利，洼地变米仓
    ——王稳庄乡改造盐碱洼地由穷乡变成富乡
    本报记者　钟林
    惊人的变化
    河北省天津专区静海县王稳庄乡靠近渤海，地势低洼。全乡有着十来万亩盐碱地，解放前只耕种了二万多亩地，种的是小麦、高粱，单位面积产量很低。1948年，平均每亩地只产粮五十来斤。这里的农民们，绝大部分过着“吃糠菜饭，喝黄蓿汤”的贫困日子。饿死人和出外逃荒的事，各村在解放前年年都有。解放后的三、四年内，虽然经过土地改革，并且把耕地面积逐渐扩大到两万八千多亩，1952年粮食增产到三百万斤，但还是不够吃，国家除了每年发放救济款和生活贷款三、四十万元，帮助群众渡荒以外，每年还得从外地调去二、三百万斤粮食。从1953年到1955年，部分农民组织了互助组和初级农业生产合作社，继续扩大耕地面积，引水改种了一千多亩稻子，还浇了一部分小麦，使粮食产量有所提高。但全乡1954年还缺粮一百五十万斤，1955年还缺粮八十万斤。
    1955年冬和1956年春，在合作化高潮当中，全乡成立了一个有着二千四百多户、一万三千多口人的高级农业社，取名叫富民农业生产合作社。这个社统一筹划，因地制宜兴修水利，把耕地扩大到三万五千多亩，其中二万二千多亩种了稻子。1956年全社的粮食总产量达到一千二百二十万斤，每亩产量平均三百四十多斤。全乡不仅不需要国家供应粮食，还卖了五百万斤粮食给国家。1956年冬和1957年春，富民农业社扩大了兴修水利的规模，共挖了一百二十万公方土，修成了三条主干渠，五十五条支渠，七千多条毛渠，一个节制闸和五十五个小水闸，从马厂减河引来淡水，冲洗了盐碱地，排除了咸水，再用淡水灌溉，把耕地面积扩大到四万多亩，种了三万多亩稻子。虽然今年天旱，淡水水源也受很大限制，庄稼的成长受了一定的影响。预计全乡今年还可收粮食一千六百多万斤，每亩平均产量将近四百斤。
    一个穷乡已经变成富乡了。用当地农民的话来说，这种变化简直是“一步登天”！为什么会有这种变化呢？社员们都认识得很清楚：关键就在于合作化以后，大家齐心奋斗，因地制宜兴修了水利，把盐碱洼地逐渐变成良田，改种了稻子。
    开渠种稻，这本来是当地许多农民多年来的愿望。解放前，这种愿望只能是一种幻想。解放初期，王稳庄等村曾经屡次联合，企图挖一条河引进淡水来大量种稻，但由于单干的力量薄弱，村和村之间又存在着严重的矛盾，仅河身占地的问题就难以解决，好容易测了一条曲曲弯弯的渠道，但阻碍重重，结果也没有修通。
    1955年冬，全乡建成一个高级的农业生产合作社以后，渠道占地问题，劳动力调配问题都得到了可以顺利解决的条件。在上级和乡的党委领导下，社里成立了洼地改造委员会，召集老农民和生产队长们开了多次座谈会，并到洼地里进行调查研究，制定了改造洼地和改种稻子的规划草案，经过各生产队的社员们讨论修改以后，又召开社员代表会议讨论通过，就大规模地兴修起水利来了。
    在测量渠道和修闸等工程技术上，富民农业社碰到了不少的困难问题。乡党委采取发动群众献策献计、边学边作的办法，困难一个一个地被克服了。在测量渠道线的时候，他们向栽电线杆的工人学会了找直的办法。渠道的宽度深度，他们也组织熟悉情况的老农民，一边勘测水势、水量和水的流向，一边计算，然后讨论确定。结果，挖成的引水渠和排水渠，基本上都是畅通的合用的。
      就地取材修水利
    开始，有的社员希望从国家得到贷款来作兴修水利的资金。乡党委教育大家要坚决贯彻执行勤俭办事的方针，要求大家想办法，尽量作到不花钱或少花钱就把事办好。他们修的一个节制闸，五十五个小闸和四座桥，原计划要用石头、砖、水泥或石灰，需款三万二千元。经过发动群众想办法以后，他们用破石滚子作基础，用苇草和胶泥作成土牛代替石料和砖筑成坝，再用些旧木料作成闸门和桥梁，就把闸和桥修起来了，用的料折款只合三千四百元。这样的闸和桥用到现在也还很坚固。社员们很高兴地说：“咱们有的是苇草和胶泥，也有的是力气，土牛冲坏了重换一个就是，根本不用花几个钱就把事情办成了。”
    他们在水利方面的现款投资，都花在最必需的地方，如买锅驼机等等。
    在扩大稻田改种稻子当中，他们最大的困难之一，是许多人不会插秧。但他们找来了三百来个插秧老手，把他们分到各生产队去，利用盆、簸箕和水坑当稻田，用草代替秧来训练新手插秧，经过社员们勤学苦练，一个月当中，就有二千多人学会了插秧的本领，保证了今春插秧任务的顺利完成。全社还有三十多个社员学会了使用和检修锅驼机等机器的技术。在测量渠道、修闸、修桥、修过水道等方面，他们也培养出了一批技术力量。
    1957年春季，富民农业社的水利工程共需挖一百多万公方土，他们还要耕种三万多亩稻田。怎样调配劳动力，使开渠和种稻都不耽误农时呢？这是一个重大问题。社里提出了“壮年开渠、有经验的老农民耕地插秧，妇女们掘地”的号召。经过社员们酝酿和讨论，根据活的难易等条件，比较合理地定出了在不同的地形下开各种渠、耕各种地的评工记分办法；并且把开渠和耕地、插秧的任务，按段按片合理地分配给各生产队，由各队包工包产，超额的另给奖励。还发动了生产队与生产队之间、组与组之间、社员与社员之间的劳动竞赛。这样，把全乡的男女老少、整劳动力和半劳动力，都动员到水利工程和春耕生产任务上去了，劳动效率也比从前大大提高，这就保证了按时按量地完成了水利工程和春耕生产任务。新开的渠道还赶上了三万多亩稻地插秧用水的需要。
    由于农业的增产，富民农业社的底子也厚起来了，社员们也逐渐富裕起来了。以公共财产来说，1956年全社就有价值五十多万元的机器、水车、牲口、大车等生产资料。1956年年终分配时，全社的农副业收入，平均每人就分得将近一百元，各生产队的副业收入，社员家庭的副业收入都未计算在内。据社里预计，今年全社可收一千六百多万斤粮食。卖给国家三百八十万斤粮食，平均每人可分得卖粮款六十余元。其余的除留下饲料和种籽等而外，每个社员平均还可分到四百多斤粮食。而社的副业收入，生产队的和社员家庭的副业收入均不计算在内。
    现在，王稳庄乡家家户户经常吃的是大米饭。人们也穿得比从前整齐了，许多人在下雨天用来防雨的已不是蓑衣斗笠，而是雨衣、雨布和胶鞋了。住的方面，仅去年冬天今年春天新盖和翻修的，用土坯建筑的、有玻璃窗和油漆门框的房子，就有四千二百多间；还有不少的人正准备在今冬明春添盖或翻修房子。由于生产的提高和生活的逐渐富裕，原来的老单身汉们也纷纷结婚了。过去流浪在外谋生的人，也纷纷搬回来安家立业了。今年秋天，天津市还有四十来个初中和高中毕业学生到这乡参加了农业生产合作社。
    富民农业社的社员们，还准备继续扩大兴修水利的规模，继续扩大耕地面积和种稻面积。今冬明春将再作四十二万公方土的水利工程，开盐碱荒地一万亩，把稻地扩大到五万亩，并注意积肥施肥，把1958年的单位面积产量提高到平均每亩五百多斤，使全乡明年的粮食总产量达到二千七百万斤。明年准备卖给国家一千万斤商品粮。他们现在已开辟了五十亩地的苗圃培育树苗，打算把村边、道路旁、渠道旁都种上树。还准备培植一万五千亩苇蒲，并且扩大养猪养鱼等副业。
