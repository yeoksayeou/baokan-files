　　A Net of Heaven and Earth
　　By our reporter Xiao Ming

　　"...Just as the crowds were dispersing at the Yatang market, the financial institutions within the market, such as the grain station, tax office, and food company, were subjected to a robbery by a gang of bandits. This was a group of counter-revolutionary bandits composed of released criminal offenders, illegal landlords, and rich peasant elements, etc. While robbing property, they committed murder. This group of bandits successively killed seven people, robbed a batch of property and grain coupons, and then continued to besiege the supply and marketing cooperative.... People were enraged by this bloody crime. The peasants working in the fields, the merchants, cadres, workers, students, and pedestrians on the road participating in the market, all took up shoulder poles and hoes to participate in the encirclement and suppression of the bandits, forming a net of heaven and earth with more than five thousand people on the various roads where the bandits fled. Within two days, all the bandits were caught."
　　In the first exhibition room of the "Exhibition of Evidence of Crimes by Counter-Revolutionary Elements and Other Criminal Offenders," visitors quietly listened to the narrator telling the story of the people's heroic annihilation of bandits in Lianjiang County, Guangdong Province, on July 12th of this year. A young military officer excitedly said to his companion: "This is the net of heaven and earth that the people have woven for counter-revolutionary elements." Yes, with such a net of heaven and earth, whether the enemy is acting openly or hidden, they will suffer a painful defeat.
　　For example, that seemingly respectable old man of sixty was actually the criminal Wang Zhennan, who murdered Li Dazhao and dozens of other revolutionary martyrs. After liberation, he schemed day and night to find the best safe box to hide his fox tail, and finally, in 1950, he infiltrated the Shanghai Higher People's Court. Because Wang Zhennan behaved "very vigorously" in his long-term work, being "conscientious and responsible," the leaders of the Shanghai Higher People's Court deeply believed in him. However, some comrades who worked with him were surprised that Wang Zhennan always had different views from his comrades on many things, and spoke behind their backs rather than face to face. Wang Zhennan was very disgusted with young activists, calling them "that bunch of things"; when the leadership made changes to the work arrangements, he said "too dialectical"; in the 1955 anti-hidden counter-revolutionaries movement, the masses investigated his reactionary words and deeds and his history, and many people reported him. Wang Zhennan, the criminal who murdered Li Dazhao and dozens of other revolutionary martyrs, was finally uncovered.
　　Yang Jinxing, the murderer who killed General Yang Hucheng and participated in the killing of more than 300 revolutionary martyrs such as Luo Shiwen, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Che Yaoxian, Secretary of the Western Sichuan Special Committee of the Communist Party of China, fled to Qingju Township, Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, before the liberation of Chongqing, changed his name to Yang Dafa, and went into hiding. This Yang Dafa made friends and was very close to the peasants in Qingju Township. He was willing to work hard in farming, and on windy and rainy days, when others were resting at home, he went to the fields. When the mutual aid team was established, he became the leader. During the land reform, he actively struggled against the landlords and was rated as a "poor peasant" and distributed land. Although Yang Jinxing tried very hard, thought of many ways, and received many good reviews, some farmers in the village always suspected him, thinking that his origins were unclear; saying he was from Guang'an, why didn't he return to Guang'an; why were this couple so well-dressed when they came; why was this person so close to several Kuomintang elements in the village. Teng Mingzhong, a farmer who often paid attention to Yang Dafa, once carried things with Yang Dafa and passed by a dangerous mountain. He heard Yang Dafa mutter to himself, "If anything unexpected happens in the future, this is a good place to take refuge." Once, Yang Dafa suddenly wanted to go to Huaying Mountain to burn incense. Teng Mingzhong wanted to find out what he was going to do, so he volunteered to lead the way for him. When they reached the foot of the mountain, Yang Dafa insisted that Teng Mingzhong go back, and Yang Dafa went up the mountain alone and stayed there for several days. Teng Mingzhong felt that this was very suspicious, so he reported these situations to the public security organs one by one. Teng Zhiyuan, a primary school teacher, and Lei Kaiyun, a worker, also reported Yang Jinxing. With the broad masses of the people as their eyes and ears, no matter how cleverly the counter-revolutionary elements hid, they could not escape the net of justice. This executioner, whose hands were stained with the blood of Communists and progressive patriots, was finally arrested.
　　Wan Guoxiong, a counter-revolutionary element who committed many evils, sneaked into Shanghai in 1950. In order to lie dormant for a long time, he disguised himself as a woman and used the alias Wang Xiujuan. He permed his hair, applied rouge and powder, wore lipstick, wore a gorgeous high-necked cheongsam, carried a beautiful and exquisite handbag, and trembled his high and protruding breasts, what a charming and gorgeous woman. However, no matter how cunning the counter-revolutionary elements were, no matter how painstakingly the counter-revolutionary elements worked, he could not hide from his neighbors—the people who were in constant contact with him—for a long time. Some people wondered why this "woman" had such long leg hair, which could be clearly seen even when wearing stockings; some people wondered why this "woman" had an Adam's apple; some people had discovered that this "woman" was wearing a fake bra. The mask of this "woman" was thus gradually unveiled.
　　Not only do the general masses know how to deal with these hidden enemies, but even those who have family relationships with counter-revolutionary elements are very clearly aware of how they should act. The son of Wang Zhennan, the criminal who murdered Li Dazhao and dozens of other revolutionary martyrs, was the earliest informant of Wang Zhennan's crimes. Lin Bangzhe, a bandit sent back to the mainland by the Chiang gang's secret service, who conspired to organize an armed riot, originally wanted to return home and hide for a period of time to escape the pursuit of the public security organs, but he was persuaded by his brother—a demobilized soldier—to confess to the public security organs. Deng Shuyi, a female agent, was reported by Chen Bo, a young shop assistant who had been in love with her. Shi Jinwen, a Chiang gang agent sent back to the mainland to develop a secret service organization and collect intelligence, was reported by his uncle and cousin. The "direct leader of the Jinan intelligence group," a Chiang gang agent sent back to the mainland from Hong Kong, was persuaded by his mother to confess to the government. All of this not only shows the high awareness of the people but also shows how deeply the Party's various policies in the anti-hidden counter-revolutionaries work have penetrated the hearts of the people.
　　The net woven by the broad masses of the people with their own eyes and ears and wisdom is so tight and extensive, it specifically and vividly demonstrates the support of the people for the anti-hidden counter-revolutionaries movement, and also shows that the anti-hidden counter-revolutionaries movement is built on the broadest mass base. Several charts at the exhibition show the following figures: From June 1955 to December 1956, the public security organs received more than six million letters from people of all strata in cities and villages reporting counter-revolutionary elements; this figure is precisely the source of our socialist motherland's ability to become more and more consolidated day by day.

　　天罗地网
　　本报记者　肖明
    “……正当雅塘墟集场上人群星散的时候，墟内的粮站、税务所、食品公司等财经机关，遭受了一群匪徒的抢劫。这是一股由已经释放的刑事罪犯、不法地主、富农分子等凑合成的反革命匪徒集团，他们一边抢劫财物，一边行凶杀人。这群匪徒先后杀害了七人，抢劫了一批财产、粮票后，又继续围攻供销合作社……。人们被这血腥罪行激怒了，正在田间劳动的农民，集场上赶集的商贩、干部、工人、学生、路上的行人，都拿起扁担、锄头参加了对匪徒们的围剿，在匪徒们逃窜的各条道路上，布下了五千多人的天罗地网。两天之内，匪徒们全部落网。”
    在“反革命分子及其他刑事犯罪分子罪证展览会”第一展览室里，参观的人们静静地听着说明员讲着这个今年7月12日发生在广东省廉江县的人民英勇歼匪的故事。一位年青军官激动地向他的伙伴说：“这是人民给反革命分子结成的天罗地网。”是的，有了这样的天罗地网，不管是公开活动的敌人还是隐藏的敌人，都会遭到惨痛的失败。
    比如，那个年已六旬、道貌岸然的老人，却原来是杀害了李大钊同志等数十名革命志士的罪犯王振南。解放以后，他日夜思谋为自己找一个最好的隐藏狐狸尾巴的保险箱，终于于1950年，混入上海市高级人民法院。由于王振南在长期工作中表现得“很卖力气”，“认真、负责”，上海高级人民法院领导上，对他深信不疑。然而，和他在一起工作的同志，有的却奇怪，为什么王振南对许多事情，总有与同志们不同的看法。而且当面不讲背后讲。王振南十分讨厌青年积极分子，称他们“这班东西”；领导上布置的工作有了变动，他说“太辩证了”；在1955年肃反运动中，群众追究了他的反动言行，清查了他的历史，还有许多人检举了他。王振南这个杀害了李大钊等数十名革命志士的罪犯终于被清查出来。
    杀害杨虎城将军，并参与杀害中共四川省委书记罗世文，中共川西特委车耀先等革命志士三百余人的凶手杨进兴，于重庆解放前夕，带领妻子逃到四川南充县青居乡，改名为杨大发潜藏下来。这个杨大发，在青居乡认亲拜友，和农民处得亲亲热热。种庄稼肯下苦功夫，大风大雨的日子，别人在家休息，他却下田。成立互助组时，他当上了组长。土地改革时，他积极斗争地主，被评为“贫农”分得了土地。尽管杨进兴卖了很大力气，想了许多办法，取得了不少好评。但是村上有些农民总怀疑他，认为他来路不明；说是广安人，为什么不回广安；这对夫妻来时为什么穿得那么阔气；这个人为什么和村上的几个国民党分子处得火热。经常注意杨大发的农民滕明忠，有一次与杨大发挑东西，路过一座险山，听见杨大发小声自言自语说：“以后出啥意外，这里倒是个避难的好地方”。有一回，杨大发突然要到华蓥山进香，滕明忠想探听他去干啥，自愿给他带路，行到山麓，杨大发硬让滕明忠回去，而杨大发便独自上山，并在那里住了好几天。滕明忠觉得这事很可疑，就把这些情况一一报告了公安机关。检举杨进兴的还有小学教员滕志远，工人雷开云等。公安机关有了广大群众作自己的耳目，无论反革命分子隐藏得多么巧妙，也难逃法网。这个双手染满共产党人和进步志士鲜血的刽子手，终被逮捕了。
    作恶多端的反革命分子万国雄，1950年潜入上海，为长期潜伏，他男扮女装化名王秀娟。他烫起头发，抹脂粉，涂口红，穿着华丽高领旗袍，手提美丽玲珑的提包，颤动着高高凸起的乳房，好一个妖艳华丽的妇人。但是，无论反革命分子怎样诡计多端，无论反革命分子多么煞费苦心，他却没有能长期隐瞒住他的邻居——经常接触他的人。有人奇怪这个“女人”腿上的汗毛为什么长得那么长，穿着丝袜还看得清清楚楚；有人奇怪这个“女人”为什么有喉骨节；有人曾发现这个“女人”带的是假乳罩。这个“女人”的假面具，就这样一点一点的被揭开了。
    不仅一般群众知道怎样对付这些潜藏的敌人，就是那些和反革命分子有亲属关系的人，也十分清醒的知道自己应该怎样行动。杀害李大钊等革命志士数十人的罪犯王振南的儿子，就是王振南罪行的最早检举人。被蒋帮特务机关派遣回大陆，阴谋组织武装暴乱的匪徒林邦者，原想回到家里潜藏一个时期，躲避公安机关的追捕，却被他的兄弟——一位复员军人劝说得向公安机关坦白自首了。派遣女特务邓淑仪，被曾与他恋爱过的青年店员陈波检举了。被派遣回大陆，发展特务组织，搜集情报的蒋帮特务石锦文，被他的舅父和表妹检举了。由香港派遣回大陆的蒋帮特务“直属济南情报组长”，被他的母亲劝说得向政府坦白自首了。所有这些，不仅说明了人民群众的高度觉悟，而且说明了党在肃反工作中的各项政策是怎样的深入了人心。
    广大人民群众用自己的耳目和智慧织成的罗网，就是这般严紧和广泛，它具体、生动的表现了人民群众对肃反运动的拥护和支持，也说明了肃反运动是建立在最广泛的群众基础上。展览会上的几张图表上，标明了以下几个数字：从1955年6月至1956年12月，公安机关接到城、乡各阶层群众检举反革命分子的检举信达六百多万件；这数字正是我们社会主义祖国能够一天比一天巩固的源泉。
