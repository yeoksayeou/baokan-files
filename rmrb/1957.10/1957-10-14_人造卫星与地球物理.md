    The successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite will deepen and broaden human understanding of the characteristics of outer space and the nature of the Earth as a planet in the solar system.
    Rockets and artificial satellites are the most important tools for studying geophysical phenomena. However, rockets can only make rapid observations during the short period of ascent and descent because they cannot stay in the air for a long time; they can only measure the vertical structure of the upper atmosphere, and it is difficult to measure the spatial distribution and temporal changes of the physical state of the upper atmosphere. Artificial satellites, launched by multi-stage rockets, can not only reach higher altitudes but also orbit the Earth for weeks, months, or even longer, and can travel over vast areas, obtaining scientific data measured at almost the "same time." Therefore, they enable people to grasp more comprehensive knowledge.
    Artificial satellites can help improve the accuracy of geodesy, measure the shape of the Earth more precisely, and open up new avenues for studying the large-scale uneven distribution of the gravitational field. The Earth is a flattened ellipsoid, and humans live on it, restricted by atmospheric refraction, so the precision of geodesy is affected to some extent. Using artificial satellites, true three-dimensional large-scale measurements of the Earth can be successfully achieved. This will not only accurately determine intercontinental distances, calculate the shape and flattening of the Earth, and improve the accuracy of ephemeris calculations, but also help study irregular changes in the Earth's rotation and verify the theory of continental drift. As an artificial satellite orbits the Earth, small wobbles will occur in its elliptical orbit due to the uneven distribution of density on the Earth's surface. Precise observations can detect these small wobbles, thereby deducing the large-scale uneven distribution of the Earth's mass and helping us further understand the structure of the Earth's crust.
    The upper atmosphere, about eighty kilometers or more above the Earth's surface, is in an ionized state with charged particles. This is the ionosphere, which is closely related to shortwave radio communication. Up to now, the study of the ionosphere has mainly relied on the method of reflecting radio waves from the ionosphere back to the ground to measure the equivalent height of different ionospheric layers and the critical frequency representing the maximum ionization density. The actual height of the upper boundary of the ionosphere is still unknown. The launch of artificial satellites makes measuring the ionization state of the atmosphere near the satellite's orbit and analyzing the mechanisms of its occurrence an important and new research topic. For example, measuring the signal level of radio waves emitted from artificial satellites and the angle of refraction of various frequencies of radio waves on the Earth's surface can provide previously unstudied data on the attenuation of radio waves in the ionosphere and some information about the structure of these parts. A detailed study of these scientific data will contribute to the development of radio wave propagation theory and help improve the efficiency of shortwave communication.
    Using artificial satellites, the relationship between solar physics and geophysics can be further studied. Due to the existence of the atmosphere, especially the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, solar radiation with wavelengths shorter than 0.29μ is completely absorbed before it reaches the Earth's surface. Therefore, this part of the radiation has not been well studied until now. Furthermore, when solar flares occur, it has been preliminarily determined that there is a close relationship between them and the sudden increase in the degree of ionization in the "D layer" of the ionosphere, as well as the sudden fading of radio communication. However, the detailed nature of this flare radiation has not yet been clarified. Since artificial satellites orbit the Earth at extremely high altitudes, actually outside the atmosphere, they can be equipped with special instruments to measure the ultraviolet, X-ray, and Y-ray portions of the solar spectrum, and in particular to determine the role of these shortwave solar radiations in the formation of various ionospheric layers, as well as to study the physical processes by which these radiations are absorbed in the upper atmosphere.
    The particle radiation from the sun is also closely related to many important geophysical phenomena. The emission of particle radiation from the sun is the direct cause of geomagnetic storms and disturbances in the upper ionosphere. When geomagnetic storms and ionospheric disturbances occur strongly, they seriously hinder normal telecommunications on Earth, causing considerable losses. This solar particle radiation is also causally related to the auroras that appear at high latitudes on Earth. Originally, charged particles emitted from the sun into the Earth's atmosphere, under the influence of the Earth's magnetic field, will move along spiral orbits towards the north and south magnetic poles of the Earth in an accelerated motion. When these high-speed particles enter the upper atmosphere, they collide with thin air molecules, causing the gas to be in an excited state, producing beautiful auroras. Therefore, solving the nature of particle radiation, measuring the intensity of solar particle radiation, the speed at which it enters the upper atmosphere, and determining its role in the formation of many of the aforementioned geophysical phenomena is extremely important. These problems can be solved successfully with special instruments installed on artificial satellites.
    Although observations and studies of cosmic rays have been carried out in various parts of the Earth, the original composition and changes in cosmic rays are still not fully understood, also due to the existence of the atmosphere. Although high-altitude observations have been carried out in recent years using airplanes, balloons, and rockets, the data obtained are also very limited. Using artificial satellites equipped with new types of instruments, continuous measurement of various beneficial scientific data related to cosmic rays can be obtained over a vast area due to their orbiting the Earth at extremely high altitudes. The material obtained from observing cosmic rays from artificial satellites can also help clarify the daily, semi-daily, and twenty-seven-day periodic variations of cosmic rays, as well as the relationship between these variations and solar physical phenomena.
    In interstellar space, there are also many interstellar materials, larger ones such as meteors and micrometeorites, and smaller ones such as atomic-sized low-energy particles. The presence of these micrometeorites and low-energy particles in the upper atmosphere determines and restricts certain physical processes in the upper atmosphere. At the same time, the existence of meteors and micrometeorites poses a certain danger to artificial satellites. Even tiny particles traveling at speeds of fifty to seventy kilometers per second can penetrate the outer shell of artificial satellites. Therefore, studying the intensity and energy of these interstellar materials, as well as their distribution in space, is of paramount importance for making reliable estimates of the "meteoroid hazard" that may be encountered in future interstellar travel. To solve this problem, instruments for recording meteoroid collisions should be installed on artificial satellites to obtain the data we need.
    Artificial satellites carrying precision instruments flying in high orbit will contribute to geomagnetism in two ways. First, the regular and irregular short-term changes in the Earth's magnetic field and their causes are closely related to the current systems operating in the upper atmosphere. In the past, this important theory was only verified indirectly. Now, it is possible to directly examine these current systems, determine their position and intensity, and study their properties and causes. Second, using special devices on artificial satellites, measurements of the high-altitude geomagnetic field can be made in a wide space to understand the relationship between the total intensity of the geomagnetic field and its components and altitude function.
    More examples can be given to illustrate the application of artificial satellites in geophysics. As time passes, the shape and size of the satellite's orbit will gradually change due to the resistance of the thin atmosphere in the upper atmosphere of the Earth. From the changes in orbit and speed, we can obtain the atmospheric density at various altitudes. Also, artificial satellites can be equipped with television to continuously photograph changes in cloud cover on the Earth, which is also a valuable material for weather forecasting.

    苏联人造卫星的发射成功，使人类对于宇宙空间的特性的认识，对于作为太阳系的一个行星地球的性质的认识，都将因而加深和扩大。
    火箭和人造卫星都是研究地球物理现象最重要的工具。但火箭只能在上升和下降的短时间内作快速的观测，因为它不能在空中作较长时间的逗留；只能测到高空大气垂直方向的结构，很难测高层大气物理状态的空间分布和时间变化情况。人造卫星利用多节火箭发射出去，不但能到达更高的高空，还能环游地球数周、数月甚至更长时间，并能行经广大地区的上空，获取几乎“同一时期”测量的科学资料，因此它更能使人们掌握较全面的知识。
    人造卫星可以帮助提高大地测量的精确度，更精确地测量地球的形状，以及为研究重力场大范围不均匀分布开辟了新的途径。地球是一个扁平的椭圆球体，人类寓居在上面，又受大气层蒙气差的限制，因此测地的精密度受到一定的影响。利用人造卫星，地球上真正的三度空间的大范围测量，就可能胜利实现，不仅可以精确地测定洲际距离，测算地球的形状及其扁平度和提高历表编制的准确度，而且对于研究地球自转的不规则变化，以及大陆漂移学说的验证，都有所帮助。人造卫星绕地球运行，由于地表密度分布的不均匀，人造卫星在运行的椭圆轨道中，将发生小的摆动，精确的观测可以发觉这些小的摆动，从而推算地球质量大范围不均匀的分布，帮助我们进一步了解地壳的构造。
    距离地球表面八十公里左右以上的高空大气层，气体是在带有电荷的游离的状态中，这就是与短波无线电通讯密切有关的电离层。截至目前为止，研究电离层主要是利用无线电波从电离层反射回地面的方法，测得不同电离层的相当高度和代表最大电离密度的临界频率。现在实际上还不知道电离层的上界的高度是多少。由于人造卫星的发射，如对人造卫星所循轨道附近大气的游离状态进行测量，分析其发生的机构，是一个重要的和新的研究课题。又如在地球表面测量从人造卫星放射出来的电波信号级和各种频率的无线电波的折射角，就可以得到以前没有研究过的电离层部分的无线电波衰减的资料和关于这些部分的结构的一些资料。对于这些科学资料作详尽的研究，有助于无线电波传播理论的发展，可以帮助改进短波通讯的效率。
    利用人造卫星，还可以进一步研究太阳物理和地球物理的关系。由于大气层的存在，特别是高空臭氧层的存在，波长短于零点二九μ的太阳辐射，没有到达地球表面以前就被完全吸收了，因此这部分的辐射到现在还没有很好地研究过。又当太阳上发生喷焰时，虽已初步查明它与电离层中的“D层”的电离程度骤然加强，以及无线电通讯突然衰落三者间具有密切的联系，但这种喷焰辐射的详细性质也还没有弄清楚。人造卫星既然在极大的高度围绕地球运行，实际上已超出大气层之外，那就可以在它上面装置特殊的仪器，来测量太阳光谱紫外线、X线和Y线等部分，特别要查明这些短波的太阳辐射，对于各电离层形成过程所起的作用，以及研究这些辐射在高层大气中被吸收的物理过程。
    太阳的粒子辐射对于许多重要的地球物理现象也是紧密地联系着的。太阳发射粒子辐射，是引起地球磁暴和高空电离层扰动的直接原因；当磁暴和电离层扰动强烈出现时，会严重地妨碍地球上人类正常的电讯交通，造成相当大的损失。这种太阳的粒子辐射，又和地球上高纬度出现的极光有因果关系。原来从太阳发射到地球上空的带有电荷的质点，在地磁场的影响下，将沿着螺旋轨道，以加速的运动分别趋向于南北两个地球磁极。当这种高速质点进入高空大气层时，碰冲到稀薄的空气分子，使气体处于激发的状态而产生了美丽的极光。因此，解决微粒辐射的本质，量测太阳粒子辐射的强度、进入高空大气层的速度，以及查明它在形成上述许多地球物理现象的作用，是十分重要的。用特制的仪器装置在人造卫星上，就可能顺利地解决这些问题。
    宇宙线的观测研究，虽然曾经在地球各地进行，但同样由于大气层的存在，对于宇宙射线的原始组成和变化情况，还没有完全清楚。近年来虽已利用飞机、气球和火箭进行高空观测，但所得资料也很有限。利用人造卫星装置新型的仪器，由于它以极大的高度绕地球运行，就能在广大地域的上空不断地测得有关宇宙射线各种有益的科学资料。从人造卫星上观测宇宙线所得到的材料，还可以帮助搞清楚宇宙线的日变化、半日变化和二十七日的周期变化，以及这些变化同太阳物理现象的关系。
    在星际空间内，还存在许多星际的物质，较大的如陨星和微陨星，较小的如原子大小的低能量微粒。高层大气中存在这些微陨星和低能量的微粒，就决定和制约了高层大气中某数种物理过程。同时，陨星和微陨星的存在对于人造卫星是有一定危险性的。即使微小的质粒具有每秒五十到七十公里的速度也能穿破人造卫星外壳。因此，研究这些星际物质的强度、能量以及它们在空间的分布，对于将来星际旅行中所可碰到的“陨星危险”作出妥靠的估计，是有头等重要意义的。为了解决这个问题，就应该把记录陨星碰撞的仪器安装在人造卫星上，以便获得我们所需要的资料。
    人造卫星携带精密仪器在高空环绕飞行，对于地磁学将有两方面的贡献。第一，对于地球磁场规则的和不规则的短期变化情况以及它的成因都是和高层大气中运行的电流系统密切相联系的，过去仅凭间接的方面来验证这个重要的学说，现在已有可能直接检验这些电流系统，测定它的位置和强度，并研究它的性质和形成的原因。第二，利用人造卫星上面特殊的装置，可以在广阔的空间内进行高层地磁场的测量，以便了解地磁总强度以及它的分量和高度函数的关系。
    还可以举例子说明人造卫星在地球物理方面的应用。如随着时间的消逝，由于人造卫星在地球大气上层受到稀薄大气的阻力，卫星轨道的形状和大小将逐渐发生变化。我们从轨道和速度的变化，就可以求得各种不同高度的大气密度。又如，人造卫星上可以安装电视，连续拍摄地球上云层覆盖的变化情况，这对于天气预报也是一项极有价值的材料。
