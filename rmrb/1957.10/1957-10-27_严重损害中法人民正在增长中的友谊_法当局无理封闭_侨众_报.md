Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: The "Qiaozhong" newspaper, run by our compatriots in Paris, was unreasonably shut down by the French Ministry of Interior on August 30th under the pretext of Article 14 of the Press Law. On September 13th, the French authorities, violating human rights, unreasonably arrested the editorial staff of "Qiaozhong" newspaper. During the interrogation, the French authorities even resorted to crude methods of personal insult against the editorial staff of "Qiaozhong" newspaper, threatening, berating, handcuffing, and even forcibly searching homes and bodies. Subsequently, some overseas Chinese were also summoned by the French authorities.

"Qiaozhong" newspaper is an irregular publication funded and published by overseas Chinese in France. Its content includes reports on the great construction achievements of the motherland and exchanges on the life of overseas Chinese in France. "Qiaozhong" newspaper has been published for over four years since its founding in June 1953. It is deeply welcomed and supported by overseas Chinese, and the number of readers is increasing daily. Since its founding, the newspaper has applied to the relevant French authorities for registration in accordance with the law, but the French authorities have not indicated that they would not register it. At the same time, the publication has always complied with the provisions of Article 14 of the Press Law and sent it to the relevant French management authorities on schedule.

The unreasonable attitude of the French authorities towards our overseas Chinese compatriots has seriously damaged the growing friendship between the Chinese and French people and has aroused the anger of patriotic overseas Chinese in France. This incident of persecuting and oppressing patriotic overseas Chinese in France occurred on the eve of the visits to Taiwan by former French Prime Minister Pinay and former Minister Chakinno, which is by no means accidental. This shows that some people in the French leadership are hostile to New China and attempt to obstruct the development of friendship between the Chinese and French people, which cannot but attract attention.

    严重损害中法人民正在增长中的友谊
    法当局无理封闭“侨众”报
    新华社26日讯　巴黎我国侨胞自办的“侨众”报在8月30日被法国内政部以新闻法第十四条作借口，无理停止出版。法国当局并且在9月13日违反人权，无理拘捕“侨众”报编辑人员。在讯问过程中，法国当局竟对“侨众”报编辑人员采取粗暴的手段进行人身侮辱，威胁、谩骂，戴了手铐，甚至强逼抄家搜身。随后还有一些侨胞被法国当局传讯。
    “侨众”报是我国旅法侨胞自己筹款出刊的不定期刊物，内容是刊登祖国的伟大建设成就，以及交流旅法侨胞生活情况。“侨众”报从1953年6月创刊以来，迄今四年有余。深受侨胞欢迎与支持，读者逐日增加。该报自创刊之日起，就曾向法国有关机关依法申请办理登记手续，法国当局并未表示不予登记。同时该刊一直遵照新闻法第十四条的规定，按期寄送法国有关管理机关。
    法国当局对我国侨胞采取的这种无理态度，严重损害了中、法两国人民正在增长的友谊，并且已激起旅法爱国侨胞的愤怒。这一迫害和压迫旅法爱国华侨的事件，发生在法国前总理比内和前部长夏基诺相继访问台湾的前夕，决非偶然。这说明了法国领导集团中某些人敌视新中国和图谋阻挠中法两国人民友谊的发展，不能不引起注意。
