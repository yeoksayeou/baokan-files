    The Beijing Distribution Office of Xinhua Bookstore has organized 95 publishing houses nationwide to print a "1958 Book Calendar." The calendar is printed on woodfree paper using offset printing. One-third of the space is devoted to pictures, including artistic photographs, Chinese paintings, oil paintings, prints, and propaganda posters. Each month also has a monthly calendar page with an art picture printed on the back, some of which are finely printed in color.

    The calendar is not only beautiful in form but also rich in content. It includes biographies and introductions to the works of more than 50 famous writers from China and abroad, book knowledge, short stories, quotations, and intellectual games. The calendar also introduces the development of China's publishing industry, the nature, tasks, and publishing scope of publishing houses across the country, and the service methods of Xinhua Bookstore.

    It is estimated that this calendar will be available in Xinhua Bookstores throughout the country in December.
