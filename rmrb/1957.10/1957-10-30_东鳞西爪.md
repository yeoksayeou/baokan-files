　　Odds and Ends

　　Making Alcohol from Acorns

　　In our country, over 70% of alcohol production uses grain as raw material. The Nanyang Alcohol Factory in Henan Province began researching the production of alcohol from acorns in 1953 and put it into production in 1954, achieving an acorn starch utilization rate of 73.78%.

　　This year, provinces across the country are promoting this experience, which can save the country approximately 140,000 tons of grain annually.

　　Refining Essential Oils from Tree Leaves

　　The Zhangzhou Fragrance Factory in Fujian recently used the leaves of Litsea cubeba, lemons, eucalyptus, and magnolia trees, which are wild aromatic plants in southern Fujian, to extract valuable essential oils. In southern Fujian, the production of these wild aromatic plants and various tree leaves is very abundant. According to surveys, 200,000 jin of Litsea cubeba can be harvested annually in the southern Fujian area, which can extract over 10,000 jin of essential oil, worth more than 100,000 yuan.

　　Essential oils are important raw materials in the cosmetics, food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries, and are materials in short supply in both domestic and international markets. (Zhu Wangang)

　　Using Mulberry Bark Paper to Replace Oilcloth

　　Cui Jiadao and Lu Changnian, channel workers of the Navigation Channel Engineering Team of the Liaoning Provincial Navigation Bureau, researched a method of using mulberry bark paper coated with waste Vaseline oil to replace oilcloth, saving the country a lot of cotton cloth.

　　In the past, oilcloth was used to wrap explosive packages to prevent river water from penetrating. Each package of explosives required 2.5 chi of oilcloth, costing 1.5 yuan. Using mulberry bark paper coated with waste Vaseline to replace oilcloth only costs 0.15 yuan per package of explosives. (Han Bin)

　　Manufacturing Acid-Resistant Enamel with Cast Iron

　　The Beijing Enamel Factory recently succeeded in trial production of acid-resistant enamel equipment made of cast iron.

　　Acid-resistant enamel equipment is used in industry to hold corrosive agents. In the past, domestic production used steel plates as the inner lining, which often deformed during enameling; sand holes also easily appeared at the welded joints of the steel plates. The acid-resistant equipment made with cast iron blanks has no reduction in quality, increases output by two times, and reduces costs by about 50%. The appearance is also more beautiful after enameling.

    东鳞西爪
    用橡子造酒精
    我国生产酒精70％以上是以粮食做原料，河南省南阳酒精厂于1953年开始研究用橡子制酒精于1954年投入生产，获得了橡子淀粉利用率73.78％的成绩。
    今年，全国各省都在推广这个经验，全年可为国家节约粮食约十四万吨。
    用树叶炼香精油
    福建漳州香料厂，最近利用闽南的野生芳香植物山苍子和柠檬、桉树、玉兰花树的叶子，提炼出贵重的香精油。在闽南，这些野生芳香植物和各种树叶的产量很丰富。据调查，山苍子在闽南一带，一年可采摘二十万斤，能提炼出万余斤香精油，价值十多万元。
    香精油是化妆品、食品、化工、医药工业中的重要原料，是国内和国际市场上供不应求的物资。　　（朱万刚）
      用桑皮纸代替油布
    辽宁省航运局航道工程队航道工人崔甲道和卢常年研究出以桑皮纸外涂废凡士林油代替油布的办法，给国家节省了不少棉布。
    过去包扎炸药包时，为了防止河水浸入，都用油布包扎。每包一包炸药需油布二市尺半，合价一元五角。用桑皮纸外涂废凡士林代替油布，包扎每包炸药只需一角五分钱。　　　　（韩斌）
    用铸铁制造耐酸搪瓷
    用铸铁制造耐酸搪瓷器械，最近在北京市搪瓷厂试制成功。
    耐酸搪瓷器械是工业上用来装腐蚀剂用的。过去在国内生产都是用钢板作里胎，在搪瓷的时候，常常变形；钢板焊接处，也容易出砂眼。用铸铁胎制成的耐酸器械，质量没有降低，产量提高了两倍，成本降低了50％左右。搪瓷后外观还更漂亮。
