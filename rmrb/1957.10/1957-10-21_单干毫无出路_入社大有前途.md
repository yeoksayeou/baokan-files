    Individual Farming Leads to Nowhere; Joining the Cooperative Has a Bright Future
    Chao Yang Households that Withdrew from Cooperatives Want to Rejoin
    (By Our Newspaper) Guangdong Chao Yang County has 12,980 peasant households who, in the great debate on the issue of cooperation, distinguished between right and wrong and signed up to join agricultural cooperatives.
    The first batch of 420 cooperatives in Chao Yang County mostly entered the stage of great debate by the end of September. In areas where the foundation of cooperation was weak, such as Guiyu and Tongyu, the issue of cooperation was one of the main topics of debate. These areas paid great attention to mobilizing individual farmers and households that had withdrawn from cooperatives to participate in the great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate, and educated them on the two paths, thus raising the socialist ideological awareness of many of them. Farmers in Shigang Village, Shiqiao Township, realized after the great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate that their withdrawal from the cooperative was due to being fooled by some well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas. They discovered that the five well-to-do middle peasants, including Chen Yuxing, who initially took the lead in agitating for withdrawal from the cooperative, originally intended to undermine the cooperative in order to take the capitalist road. Over the past year, these five people purchased more than 2,000 catties of rice and also hoarded a lot of old rice, sweet potato flour, pig iron and other materials, while the poor peasants who were deceived into withdrawing from the cooperative had many difficulties that could not be solved. Some areas have therefore seen the re-emergence of polarization. Among the 205 households that withdrew from the cooperative in Xiancheng, 22 well-to-do peasant households engaged in usury, buying green crops, and buying land, exploiting poor peasants. On the other hand, in the third production team of the cooperative alone, among the 48 households that withdrew from the cooperative, seven households sold their land. These farmers outside the cooperative realized that the capitalist road was impassable. They also saw that the agricultural cooperative implemented the policy of rectification and improvement at the same time, solving many problems within the cooperative, so they dispelled their concerns and asked to join the cooperative. Seventy-seven households, including 67 households that had withdrawn from the cooperative and 13 individual farmer households in Huihuang Cooperative, Fenggang Township, have joined the cooperative. As many as 5,115 households in six townships, including Guiyu and Tongyu, have applied to join the cooperative.
    Dingtao Individual Farmers No Longer Want to Farm Individually
    (By Our Newspaper) A large number of individual farmers in Dingtao County, Shandong Province, have applied to join agricultural cooperatives after receiving socialist education.
    As of September 21, more than 3,620 individual farmer households in the county had formally applied to cooperatives to join, and some of them have been approved to join. The unanimous reflection of these farmers who want to join the cooperative is that the capitalist road is impassable, and only cooperation is the bright road. Du Guangwen (middle peasant), an individual farmer from Dulukou Village, Fangshan District, with a family of three and ten acres of good land, thought that individual farming would get better year by year, but as a result of the small number of people and weak labor, cultivation was not timely, and the yield was very low. Gao Jingyuan, an individual farmer from Xiaoyangzhuang, Chengguan District, suffered a serious illness last year, and the crops grew very badly. The small amount of savings was also spent, and if it were not for government relief, the livestock and furniture would not be kept. This year his autumn crops were flooded again, and now he is facing drought, making production even more difficult. In this socialist education, he remorsefully said: "I have truly realized the dead end of individual farming. I will join the cooperative no matter what."
    Hunan Youth Determined Not to Take the Dark Road
    (By Our Newspaper) After the education of the great socialist debate, more than 800,000 rural youths in Hunan Province have mostly realized that capitalism is a dark road, and socialism is the bright road. Many young people who have been influenced by capitalist ideas and have confused ideas are now sober. In Gougong Cooperative, Jiahe County, four members of the Communist Youth League previously agitated to withdraw from the cooperative, saying that cooperation was not as good as individual farming. League member Li Zongfu even refused to work during the rush harvesting and planting seasons, and often ran to other places. This time, after debating "What benefits has cooperation brought us?", all four woke up and realized that precisely because they joined the cooperative, even though they encountered such a drought as last year, the harvest was still better than when they farmed individually; they all said that they would never withdraw from the cooperative again, and Li Zongfu would no longer run to other places. In Wugang County, all 1,452 members of the Communist Youth League who had previously wanted to withdraw from the cooperative are now all awake and unanimously stated that they will never withdraw from the cooperative and will never take the capitalist road.

### 单干毫无出路  入社大有前途

    单干毫无出路  入社大有前途
    潮阳退社户重新要入社
    本报讯  广东潮阳县有一万二千九百八十户农民，在关于合作化问题的大辩论中分清了大是大非，报名要求参加农业社。
    潮阳县第一批四百二十个社大部分在9月底已转入大辩论阶段。在贵屿、铜盂等合作化基础薄弱的地区，合作化问题是辩论的主要内容之一。这些地区很注意发动单干户和退社户参加大鸣大放大争，对他们进行两条道路的教育，因而使他们当中的许多人提高了社会主义思想觉悟。石桥乡石港村的农民，经过大鸣大放大争，才知道他们退社是上了一部分资本主义思想严重的富裕中农的当。他们发现，当初积极带头闹退社的富裕中农陈裕兴等五人，原是为了搞垮社，以便走资本主义道路。一年来，这五人抢购了二千多斤稻谷，还囤积了不少老米、薯粉、生铁等物资，而被骗退了社的贫苦农民则有许多困难没法解决。有些地区因此重新出现两极分化的现象。仙城二百零五户退社农民中，有二十二户富裕农民放高利贷、买青苗、买田置地，剥削贫苦农民。而另一方面，单是该社第三生产队退社的四十八户农民，便有七户卖掉田地。这些社外农民由此认识了资本主义的道路是走不通的。他们又看到农业社贯彻边整边改的方针，解决了社内许多问题，因此打消顾虑，要求入社。凤岗乡辉煌社六十七户退社户和当地十三户单干户，已有七十七户入了社。贵屿、铜盂等六个乡便有五千一百一十五户要求入社。
    定陶单干户不愿再单干
    本报讯  山东定陶县大批单干农民，经过社会主义教育后，纷纷申请加入农业社。
    截至9月21日止，全县已有三千六百二十余户单干农民正式向合作社提出入社要求，其中有一部分已被批准入社。这些要求入社的农民一致的反映是：资本主义的道路是走不通的，只有合作化才是光明大道。仿山区杜路口村单干农民杜广文（中农）三口人，十亩好地，满以为单干下去能一年比一年好，结果因人少力弱，耕种不及时，产量很低。城关区小杨庄单干农民高景元，去年得了重病，庄稼长的很坏，少量积蓄也花光了，要不是政府救济，牲口、家具就保不住。今年他的秋庄稼又被水淹光，现在又遇天旱，生产更困难。在这次社会主义教育中，他痛悔地说：“我算是真正认识到单干的末路了，说啥我也要入合作社。”
    湖南青年决心不走黑路
    本报讯  湖南省八十多万农村青年经过社会主义大辩论的教育以后，大都认清了资本主义是黑路，社会主义才是光明大道。许多受过资本主义思想影响，思想糊涂的青年，现在都清醒了。在嘉禾县苟公社，过去有四个团员闹退社，他们说合作化不如单干好。团员李宗福甚至在抢收抢种中，也不出工，经常跑到外地去。这次辩论了“合作化给我们带来了什么好处”，四个人都醒悟过来，认识到正因为入了合作社，虽遇去年那样的旱灾，收成也比单干时还好；都表示决不退社了，李宗福也再不向外地跑了。武冈全县过去有一千四百五十二个共青团员想退社，现在全部觉悟，一致表示决不退社，决不走资本主义道路。
