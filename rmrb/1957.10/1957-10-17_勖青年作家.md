Encouraging Young Writers
　　Lao She

It is a good thing for young people to publish their works. A society without young writers would not be a lovable society. The Kuomintang killed many young writers, so the Kuomintang is extremely hateful. Young writers bring youth to literature and art. Young writers are the hope for the development of literature and art. A garden without young writers will soon become a wasteland. In the old society, a couple without children was called an old childless household; in the new society, this is no longer a cause for concern. However, if the Writers Association becomes an old childless household because there are no young writers, it is indeed a serious problem.

It may also be a bad thing for young people to publish their works, if it makes them arrogant, conceited, and unable to fit in anywhere, eventually ending up in the ranks of right-wingers!

It seems that publishing works has both advantages and disadvantages for young people. It depends on the attitude of the young writers. Young writers who love socialism know how to respect themselves; those who do not love socialism will abandon themselves. Why do I say this? Because in capitalist countries, it is extremely difficult for a young person to publish their works. An unknown young person cannot even find an agent, and without an agent, trying to sell manuscripts will only lead to constant rejections. In our society, young people write letters to question the editorial department when their manuscripts are returned without comments. The superiority of our social system makes it not very difficult for young people to publish their works. Young writers should recognize this and love our social system accordingly. In this way, we will become more self-respecting and strive to improve ourselves. Conversely, if one attributes the publication of one's manuscript entirely to one's own genius, one will not only fail to thank our good system and the Party that leads and nurtures us, but will gradually become dissatisfied with the Party's leadership and oppose socialism.

In capitalist countries, because the publishing industry is controlled by capitalists, many talented young people are buried. In our society, the literary and art cause is led by the Party, and every talented seedling receives the nourishment of rain and dew, hoping that it will blossom and bear fruit. Are our young writers happy, or are the young writers in capitalist countries happy? I ask the young people present to judge for themselves.

Different social systems have different requirements for writers. Publishers in capitalist countries require writers to make money for them. Socialist countries require writers to serve the people. Because the requirements for writers are different, the future of writers is also different. In capitalist countries, since writers are the capitalists' cash cows, they only have two paths to take: one is to create according to their own ideas, not listening to the publisher's instructions, preferring to starve to death rather than bow their heads. Those who take this path have indeed starved to death, and their works have never been printed. The other path is to create according to the publisher's wishes and the needs of the market. Such works are like Western women's hats, striving for novelty, and are discarded after a few days. The work becomes a commodity, and the writer has to abandon ideals and seek only to sell more, regardless of improvement.

In our social system, since the requirement for writers is to serve the people, writers must strive to improve their own thinking. Therefore, through artistic practice, writers must constantly strictly demand themselves and make progress in both art and thought. In this way, the socialist system's requirements for writers are precisely sufficient to enable writers to gradually improve, and promising writers will gradually become thinkers and artists with the most lofty ideals.

I also ask my friends to judge for themselves which of these two requirements and their results is good and which is bad.

Here, I want to add a point: perhaps some people will ask, if the requirements of capitalist countries for writers are like that, why do they also produce quite good works? This must be answered from two aspects: on the one hand, if those writers who can write quite good works could receive more of the encouragement and leadership that we can receive, their achievements, especially in thought, would certainly be greater. Unfortunately, what they receive is not leadership and encouragement, but the control and exploitation of publishers and agents, and their talents are limited and cannot be fully developed. Their thoughts are confused, sometimes progressing, sometimes regressing, and they cannot consistently adhere to the truth. Their social system restricts their development. On the other hand, their quite good works, although not entirely in line with the publisher's requirements, may be estimated to be liked by the people, and the publisher cannot but print their works for the sake of profit.

From the above point, we can see who has freedom and who does not have freedom. The right-wingers in the literary and art circles think that we do not have creative freedom. I want to ask: are writers who are controlled and exploited by capitalists considered to have freedom? Are writers who cater to the tastes of publishers and agents, writing some nonsensical love or detective stories in order to make a living, considered to have freedom? Are writers who write for a lifetime and dare not say a more progressive word considered to have freedom? If this is considered freedom, then the noble word "freedom" is worthless. Aren't writers who strive for such freedom fools?

Right-wingers will say: no, it is not to strive for this kind of freedom, but to strive for writers to write whatever they want. Look how fancy the literary and art works produced in capitalist countries are. Okay, let's see how fancy they are. In the United States, for example, the works with the widest sales are roughly of three types: love novels, detective novels, and movie stories. Most love novels only write up to the point of marriage, because after marriage, the problems are too practical and not so romantic. Detective novels, as everyone knows, rely only on a little technique to deliberately create suspicion, and only on the last page do they reveal who the murderer or thief is. Movie stories are even more needless to explain, knowing how absurd most Hollywood movies are, one knows what literary and artistic value movie stories have. These three types of "works" have almost no thought. The people who "create" these stories are "anonymous heroes" for a lifetime, producing in large quantities, with extremely low pay, and the publishers don't even print their names on the books. They are not writers, but machines. Fancy? Too monotonous, too superficial, too cruel!

Fancy? In the United States, the United States that right-wingers admire, there is no way out for poetry. The characters in the script are extremely few, and one scene, which can be performed in two and a half hours, can only be invested in and performed. Only when the performance is successful can the script be printed, otherwise there is no way out at all. Look at our poetry journals and poetry collections, look at the scripts we print, look at our "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains" with many people and scenes and the "Heroes' Meeting" full of embroidered costumes, as splendid as brocade! Who is fancy? Who is willing to spend money on literature and art? I don't need to say it, right!

The right-wingers have more to say, but it is inconvenient to say it, and their tails will be revealed as soon as they say it. What they want to say is that writers in capitalist countries don't all have to write about socialism. Yes, this is what the right-wingers admire. They long for our writers to say less about socialism and more about capitalism. They think that if writers say more about capitalism, it will prove that there is freedom of creation. Is this reasonable? Let's debate it:

Our people across the country are building socialism, but the writers want to promote capitalism, is that okay? Eating the rice and flour supplied by the people, while tempting the people to take the capitalist road, is it a writer or a traitor? If the people give the writers this kind of ungrateful freedom, the people will soon lose their own freedom. The people will not be so stupid.

Some people may say, I am not against socialism, but I ask for a little more open-mindedness. This is still unreasonable. A little more open-mindedness? Is there any thought higher and better than socialism? If not, why not promote the highest and best thought, but ask for it to be more open-minded? Do the people need us to promote Yiguandao?

No, it is not to promote Yiguandao. It is said that if the thinking is too consistent, the literary and art works will be too monotonous. We say: in order for the 600 million people to work together to build socialism, we need a common thought. Therefore, the propaganda we have done in the past is not too much, but very insufficient. As for whether the works are monotonous or not, it depends on whether the writers' lives are rich enough. In the great construction of socialism, there are thrilling things every day, everywhere, but unfortunately the writers do not know, or do not know deeply enough, so they only write some formulaic and conceptual things. This cannot be blamed on socialist thought and the literary and art policy of serving workers, peasants and soldiers. The American love novels I just mentioned are all formulaic and conceptual things, which shows that if you don't delve into life, you can't write good works anywhere. Our people's lives, because they are building socialism, are fresh, lively, and rich and colorful. We have not been able to reflect this fresh and lovely life well, we should be ashamed, and we should never say that this is the result of consistent thinking.

Some young writers, after reading a few famous Western literary works, doubt socialism, thinking that socialism will not produce great works. This is very unreasonable. If someone sees Zhuge Liang's four-wheeled carriage and says that we should not manufacture cars, we must say that he is foolish. Similarly, the great works of the previous era do not limit the next generation from producing another kind of great work. The four-wheeled carriage solves Zhuge Liang's problem, and the car solves our problem. We are socialist writers, and we should write good socialist works. This is our pride and responsibility. Great works are not produced exclusively in a certain era. Our era should have our own great works. Our era will indeed produce great works, because never in history has there been a time like our Party and government that cherish writers and value literature and art so much.

The ancient Greek tragedies showed the story of a son marrying his mother, so should we also put aside the deeds of labor heroes and create a story of a son marrying his mother? Where in the world are there such foolish writers!

We should learn from classical literature and art, but we should never copy the content, let alone say that classical masterpieces were produced because ancient life was better than today. Our works today are indeed not all excellent, which should just make us more motivated and determined to write better works. If we do not strive to move forward, but only hold Shakespeare's four great tragedies and shed tears, we will soon become tragedies too!

Young friends, please don't think about whether you will become Shakespeare first, the important thing is to go to work. As long as you are willing to love labor, love socialism, love the people, and live and struggle with the people, you will definitely write excellent works. If you really become Shakespeare, you will also be a socialist Shakespeare. If you are not willing to endure hardship and not willing to work, you will only murmur, and there is no benefit except wasting precious time.

I am willing to enthusiastically encourage you, because I myself have not written good works. Socialist writers should encourage each other, compete with each other, and should not be jealous. I earnestly hope that your achievements will be many times greater than mine! I am willing to encourage you, but you should not consider yourself talented. One who considers himself talented may cause ten young people to degenerate and become corrupt, not only ruining himself but also implicating others. I just published an "On Talent" in "Beijing Literature", if you are willing, you can take a look, I will not delay everyone's time to say it again.

　　勖青年作家
　　老舍
    青年发表作品是好事。没有青年作家的社会，不会是可爱的社会。国民党杀害许多青年作家，所以国民党极其可恨。青年作家给文艺带来青春。青年作家是文艺发展的希望所在。没有青年作家的花园必会不久变为荒地。没有儿女的夫妇，在旧社会里叫作老绝户；在新社会里，这已不是什么可发愁的事。但是，没有青年作家，使作家协会成了老绝户，的确是严重的问题。
    青年发表作品也可能是不好的事，假若这叫青年变得趾高气扬，目空一世，什么地方都摆不下他，最后只好排在右派分子的队伍里！
    青年发表作品，这么看来，有好处，也可能有坏处。这就要看青年作家的态度如何了。热爱社会主义的青年作家，知道怎么自重；不热爱社会主义的，会自暴自弃。为什么这样说呢？因为在资本主义国家里，一个青年而想发表作品，真是千难万难的事。一个无名的青年，连个代理人也找不到，没有代理人而想卖稿子，只能到处碰壁。在我们的社会里呢，编辑部退还青年的稿子而没给注上意见，青年就来信质问。我们的社会制度的优越，使青年发表作品没有很大的困难。青年作家应当认清这一点，从而热爱我们的社会制度。这么一来，我们就会越发自重，努力进修。反之，看见自己的稿子发表出来，而完全归功于自己的天才，就不但不感谢我们的好制度，和领导我们培养我们的党，反而一来二去会不满意党的领导，反对社会主义了。
    在资本主义国家，因为出版事业由资本家操纵，不知埋没了多少有天才的青年。在我们的社会里，文艺事业是由党领导的，每一个天才幼苗都得到雨露的滋润，希望它开花结果。我们的青年作家幸福呢？还是资本主义国家的青年作家幸福呢？我请在座的青年自己判断。
    社会制度不同，对作家的要求也就不同。资本主义国家的出版家，要求作家给他赚钱。社会主义国家要求作家为人民服务。对作家的要求不同，作家们的前途也就不同。在资本主义国家，作家既是资本家的摇钱树，他就只有两条路好走，一条是按照自己的思想去创作，不听出版家的指挥，宁可饿死，也不低头。走这条路的也就真有饿死的，他们的著作永远没有印出来过。另一条路是按照出版家的意思和市场的需要去创作。这种作品跟西洋妇女的帽子一样，力求花样翻新，过几天便被扔掉。作品成为商品，作家只好放弃理想，但求多卖，不管提高。
    在咱们的社会制度下，对作家的要求既是为人民服务，作家就必须努力提高自己的思想。因此，作家因艺术的实践，必定时时严格要求自己，在艺术上与思想上有所进步。这样，社会主义制度对作家的要求恰好足以使作家逐步提高，有出息的作家会逐渐成为有最崇高理想的思想家与艺术家。
    这两种要求与其结果，哪个好哪个坏，我也请朋友们自己判断。
    在这里，我要补充一点：也许有人要问，资本主义国家对作家的要求既是那样，为什么也出现相当好的作品呢？这须由两方面回答：一方面是假若那些能够写出相当好的作品的作家而能得到更多的、像我们所能得到的鼓励与领导，他们的成就，特别是在思想上，一定会更大一些。可惜，他们所得到的不是领导与鼓励，而是出版家与代理人等的控制与剥削，他们的才能便受到限制，不能尽量发挥。他们的思想是混乱的，有时候进步，有时候后退，不能始终一致，坚持真理。他们的社会制度限制住他们的发展。另一方面，他们的相当好的作品，虽然不尽合乎出版家的要求，可是估计可能受到人民的喜爱，出版家也就不能不看在利润的面上印行他们的作品。
    由上面这点补充就可以看出来谁有自由，谁没有自由。文艺界右派分子以为我们没有创作自由。我要问：是被资本家控制着剥削着的作家才算有自由吗？是因为迎合出版家与代理人的趣味，而写些不三不四的恋爱或侦探故事，以求一饱的作家才算有自由吗？是写作了一辈子，也不敢说一句比较进步的话的作家才算有自由吗？假若这算自由，自由这个高贵的名词便一文不值了。争取这样自由的作家难道不是胡涂虫么？
    右派分子会说：不，不是争取这种自由，而是争取作家爱写什么就写什么。看，资本主义国家出的文艺作品多么花哨呀。好，让我们看看怎么花哨吧。以美国来说，销路最广的作品大约有三种：恋爱小说，侦探小说和电影故事。恋爱小说大多数只写到结婚为止，因为结婚以后，问题就太实际，不那么浪漫了。侦探小说呢，谁都知道只凭一点技巧，故做疑阵，在末一页才说出来杀人的或偷东西的是谁。电影故事就更无须解释，知道好莱坞多数的电影是怎样荒唐无稽，就晓得电影故事有什么文艺价值了。这三种“作品”几乎完全没有什么思想。“创作”这些故事的人有的作一辈子“无名英雄”，大量生产，报酬极低，出版家连他们的姓名都不给印在书上。他们不是作家，而是机器。花哨吗？太单调了，太浅薄了，太残酷了！
    花哨吗？在美国，右派分子所崇拜的美国，诗是没有出路的。剧本的人物极少，一个景，两个半钟头能够演完，才有人投资演出。演出成功了，剧本才能印出来，否则全无出路。看看我们的诗刊诗集吧，看看我们印出来的剧本吧，看看我们的人多景多的“万水千山”和满台都是绣花服装，灿烂如锦的“群英会”吧！谁花哨？谁肯为文艺花钱？用不着我说了吧！
    右派分子还有话说，可是不便说出来，一说出来就露了尾巴。他们要说的是，人家资本主义国家的作家不必都写社会主义。是呀，这就是右派分子所羡慕的。他们渴望我们作家少说点社会主义，而多说点资本主义的话。他们以为作家们多说些资本主义就证明创作有了自由。这像话吗？让我们辩论辩论吧：
    我们全国人民是在建设社会主义，而作家要宣传资本主义，行不行呢？吃着人民供给的米面，而诱惑人民走资本主义道路，是作家呢，还是汉奸呢？假若人民给作家这种吃里爬外的自由，人民不久就会失去自己的自由。人民不会这么傻。
    有人也许说，我不反对社会主义，可是要求思想放宽一些。这还是不像话。思想放宽一些？难道还有比社会主义更高更好的思想？若是没有，为什么不去宣传最高最好的思想，而要求放宽一些呢？难道人民需要我们宣传一贯道？
    不，不是要宣传一贯道。是说：思想太一致了，文艺作品就太单调。我们说：为了六亿人民齐心努力建设社会主义，我们需要共同的思想。因此，我们过去所作的宣传不是太多了，而是很不够。至于作品单调不单调，就看作家的生活够不够丰富了。在社会主义伟大的建设里，惊心动魄的事情，每天有，到处有，可惜作家们不知道，或知道得不深刻，于是就只写了些公式化、概念化的东西。这一点也不能怪社会主义思想和为工农兵服务的文艺方针。刚才我提到的那些美国恋爱小说等净是些公式化、概念化的东西，足见不深入生活，在哪里也写不出好作品来。我们人民的生活，因为正在建设社会主义，是新鲜的，活泼的，丰富多采的。我们没能很好地反映这种清新可爱的生活，应当惭愧，而绝对不该说这是思想一致的结果。
    有的青年作家读了几本西洋的文艺名著，就怀疑社会主义了，以为社会主义不会产生伟大作品。这非常的不像话。假若有人看见诸葛亮坐的四轮车，而说我们不该制造汽车，我们必定说他愚蠢。同样地，前一时代的伟大作品并不限制后一代产生另一种伟大作品。四轮车解决诸葛亮的问题，汽车解决我们的问题。我们是社会主义的作家，就该写出社会主义的好作品。这才是我们应有的骄傲与责任感。伟大作品并不专产生在某一时代。我们的时代应有我们自己的伟大作品。我们的时代的确会产生伟大作品，因为历史上没有过一回，像我们的党与政府这样爱护作家，重视文艺的。
    古代希腊悲剧里表现了什么儿子娶了妈妈的故事，难道我们就也放下劳动英雄的事迹，而也去硬造出一个儿子娶妈妈的故事么？天下哪有这样胡涂的作家！
    我们应当学习古典文艺，但绝对不是照抄内容，更不能说因为古代生活比今天的好，所以才产生了古典杰作。我们今天的作品的确还不都优秀，这恰好应当使我们更奋发努力，立志写出更好的作品来。我们自己不努力前进，而只抱着莎士比亚的四大悲剧落泪，我们便也快成了悲剧！
    青年朋友们，请不必先想会不会成为莎士比亚，要紧的是去工作。只要你们肯热爱劳动，肯热爱社会主义，肯热爱人民，同人民在一起生活，一起奋斗，你们一定会写出优秀的作品来。假若你们真成为莎士比亚，也是社会主义的莎士比亚。不肯吃苦，不肯工作，你们就只会唧唧咕咕，除了浪费大好时光，别无好处。
    我愿热诚地鼓舞你们，因为我自己没有写出过好作品来。社会主义的作家应当彼此鼓励，彼此竞赛，而不应当嫉妒，我切盼你们的成就比我的大出多少倍！我愿鼓舞你们，你们可不该以才子自居，一个以才子自居的也许会使十个青年堕落腐化，不但毁了自己，还连累了别人。我刚刚在“北京文艺”上发表了一篇“论才子”，假若你们愿意，可以看一看，我就不多耽误大家的时间再说一遍了。
