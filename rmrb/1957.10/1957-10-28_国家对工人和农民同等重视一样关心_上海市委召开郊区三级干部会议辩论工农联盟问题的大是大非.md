The State Attaches Equal Importance and Concern to Workers and Peasants
Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Holds Meeting of Three-Level Cadres in Suburban Areas to Debate the Major Issue of the Worker-Peasant Alliance

(Our reporter Ji Yin reports) Not long ago, a fierce ideological exchange on the issue of the worker-peasant alliance unfolded at a rural three-level cadre meeting convened by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Workers and peasants have seen significant improvements in their lives since liberation, and a reasonable difference is currently maintained.

The major exchange was first sparked by the claim that "peasants' lives are hard." At the beginning of the meeting, a group of cadres who styled themselves as "spokespersons for the peasants" voiced a series of grievances: "The peasants' lives are hard, the workers' lives are good, the state is treating the peasants too unfairly," "Workers live in three-story buildings, peasants in one-story buildings, the difference is too great..."

"Are the peasants' lives really hard?" During the discussion, everyone felt that this question was too vague and should be made clearer. If we say they are generally hard, then our country's production is still backward today, and not only are the peasants' lives poor, but the lives of workers and cadres are also poor, and everyone has a hard time. If we say that peasants are still as miserable today as they were in the past, that is simply not true.

This issue was relatively easy to clarify, because many of the rural cadres at the meeting had personally experienced their own turnaround, and they were also witnesses to the thriving lives of Shanghai's suburban peasants since liberation. People at the meeting cited many vivid facts: the "Chen Family White Walls" (village name) before liberation had no white walls, but now real white-walled houses have been built; in the past, many peasants ate wheat-end rice, but now they eat rice, and the stone mills and stone mortars for grinding wheat have been turned into sharpening stones and bridge slabs. The six stone mills and six stone mortars of the Sixth Production Team of the Xingguang Cooperative in the Eastern Suburbs have all been repurposed in this way. In the past, the lives of suburban peasants were "a basket of vegetables and eight liang of rice, only seeing vegetables and not rice," but now, in the Hongxing First Branch of the Western Suburbs, among 318 purely peasant households, 88% of the peasants are living the lives of prosperous peasants. Last year, the average income per person was 178 yuan, and the average income per household was 858 yuan. In the past, peasants could not enjoy any cultural life at all, but now they watch movies, listen to the radio, and have clubs. Each township has health clinics and joint clinics, and they treat schistosomiasis...

Of course, there are also people in the suburbs who are more miserable than in the past; they are landlords, rich peasants, some lazy people, and a small number of people who have lost their ability to work. But the vast majority of peasants' lives have improved a lot compared to the past, and there is not much disagreement on this point.

There was more debate about whether the difference between workers' and peasants' lives was very large. People compared them in various aspects, and they found that the examples cited by everyone of workers' lives being too good were mostly some young workers who were not married and had no family burdens, or workers whose families were in the countryside, and that the lives of ordinary workers and peasants, although different, were not that different. Moreover, the income of some peasants in the suburbs is even higher than that of workers. Last year, the average income per person in the Hongxing Third Branch of the Western Suburbs was 229 yuan, and the average income per household was 821 yuan, while the average wage of workers and staff nationwide in 1956 was only 610 yuan. If calculated on the basis of a family of four, the average income per person per year was only 152 yuan, far less than that of the Hongxing Cooperative peasants. There are many workers in Shanghai, such as the more than 4,000 workers in the Cleaning Brigade and the workers in the Granular Fertilizer Factory, whose incomes are much lower than those of the suburban peasants.

People also did some calculations: the average income per person per year for Shanghai suburban peasants is 99 yuan, which is nearly 500 yuan for a family of five. If a worker's monthly salary is 60 yuan, that is 720 yuan a year. It seems that there is a difference of more than 200 yuan, but the standard of living is different in cities and the countryside. Workers in the city have to spend money to buy firewood, vegetables, eggs, etc., while in the countryside they often don't have to buy them. Workers in the city also have many expenses that peasants do not have, such as water and electricity, rent, union dues, alleyway fees, toilet emptying, transportation costs, etc. When you calculate it this way, the difference between workers' and peasants' incomes is very small, definitely not "heaven and earth."

"Peasants grow cotton, workers process it, both sides work, and the income should be equal, why should there be a difference?" "Saying that workers' labor is great, doesn't mean that peasants who carry burdens and plow the land don't work hard? If remuneration is based on labor, it should be equal!" Zhou Longxiang and several others further raised questions, and they disagreed that there should be a difference in the living standards of workers and peasants. However, more people believed that a large gap in the living standards of workers and peasants is not conducive to the worker-peasant alliance, and the working class should take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and should not have excessive demands on living welfare. However, maintaining a reasonable difference in the living standards of workers and peasants is also correct. They cited some survey materials from Shanghai factories to illustrate: the labor productivity of workers is much higher than that of peasants, and the economic value they create is great, but what they enjoy accounts for only a small part. For example, the Shanghai Turbine Factory creates a net output value of 23.71 million yuan a year, but the wages and welfare expenses of workers are only 3.24 million yuan, and the remaining 20.47 million yuan is all state revenue, accounting for 86.3% of the total net output value. The materials from other factories are mostly like this. People then compared them with materials from the Shanghai suburbs. The total output value of the suburbs in 1956 was 67.9 million yuan, and after deducting 35% of the production cost, the net output value created was more than 40 million yuan, with agricultural tax accounting for 2.92 million yuan, accounting for only 7% of the created value, and the peasants themselves enjoyed 93%. These two survey materials made everyone realize the difference between the two types of labor. They said that the difference in income between workers and peasants is like the fact that there are high and low work points in agricultural cooperatives. If the cooperative just distributes points rigidly, everyone will feel unmotivated. Of course, the comparison of this material is only to explain the origin of the difference in the lives of workers and peasants. As for the contribution of peasants to the country and their support for industry, it cannot be viewed from the agricultural tax alone.

Some peasants also said that workers work "freely," but in reality they "don't know the bitterness until they've tasted it." In 1954, some rural cadres in the suburbs were transferred to work as shop assistants, but they all clamored to return after a short time, saying, "Standing all day long, my legs are sore."

The state strives to help peasants improve their lives, and peasants must rely on developing production to make their lives more secure.

"The difference in living standards between workers and peasants is not large, and a little difference is also right, we understand this, but our peasants' lives are not as secure as the workers' lives, their wages are 'impervious to anything', and they also have labor insurance and welfare, but peasants have nothing, and they suffer when natural disasters come, we still don't understand this." People raised new questions.

Do peasants' lives have no security? In the discussion, everyone recalled that the lives of suburban peasants before liberation were indeed without any security. People froze to death and starved to death every year, and no one cared. Now it is completely different. Everyone cited many examples, such as when a strong typhoon hit last year, the district head personally came down, bringing money to help the victims. A tornado blew down more than 100 houses in Ertang Township, and the state allocated 50,000 yuan to help the peasants build 113 houses, and all the injured were treated. As a result, the Fifth Cooperative, which suffered the most losses that year, saw 98% of its members increase their income. Speaking of seeing a doctor, it is countless times better than in the past. When peasant Zhou Linggen fell seriously ill, an ambulance came as soon as he called, and the hospital offered installment payments and free treatment. In addition, everyone also talked about the government's construction of water conservancy, electric irrigation, tractor stations, and issuing loans in the suburbs over the past few years... All of this is to ensure the lives of peasants. Last year, the suburbs suffered severe natural disasters, but the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations increased by 11.3% compared with the bumper year of 1955, 65% of peasant households increased their income, 20% of peasant households neither increased nor decreased, and only 15% of households decreased slightly. Isn't this guaranteeing the lives of peasants?

Then everyone talked about: the conditions for guaranteeing peasants' lives are indeed worse than those of workers now, and their income is still not completely stable, but this is due to the different nature of the two types of production. Workers' welfare also comes from their own labor. Their labor productivity is high, and they produce more wealth for the country, so their welfare is naturally better. If peasants want to make their lives more secure, they must further develop production and gradually increase the public accumulation of cooperatives, which is the fundamental way to improve welfare. People also cited some examples to show that some cooperatives have good production and much better welfare. Welfare cannot rely solely on the government; it must be obtained from labor.

The price difference between industrial and agricultural products has narrowed compared with before liberation, and arbitrarily lowering or raising them is detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

"Industrial products are too expensive and agricultural products are too cheap, and peasants are losing too much." This was another major issue raised in the discussion. Some people even directly proposed: to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, we must increase the prices of agricultural products and lower the prices of industrial products.

Has the price difference between industrial and agricultural products increased compared with the past? Comrades from the commercial sector who participated in this discussion presented a lot of materials to prove that, compared with before liberation, the price difference between industrial and agricultural products in the Shanghai suburbs has generally not increased but narrowed. This is because the people's government has taken measures to stabilize prices since liberation, so that industrial products basically maintain their original level, and the purchase prices of agricultural products have been appropriately increased. It can be seen from the following material that the changes in the exchange ratio between 100 jin of medium-grade white japonica rice and several major industrial products in 1956 and 1946 are:

                 Can be exchanged in 1946   Can be exchanged in 1956
Twelve pounds of Dragon Head fine cloth   50.39 chi        59.88 chi
Beautiful short-stem matches          49.44 packs       89.12 packs
Guben soap                      77.28 bars       91.40 bars
Pomegranate granulated white sugar     22.61 jin        24.36 jin

In the discussion, people also admitted that the price difference between some industrial and agricultural products has widened if compared with before the War of Resistance Against Japan. However, there are many reasons here that need to be analyzed concretely, and it cannot be said in general that it is unreasonable now. For example, the prices of some industrial products were too low before the War of Resistance Against Japan, which was an abnormal phenomenon. At that time, Shanghai was a market for dumping goods by imperialist countries. They used their political and economic advantages to promote goods at low prices and打击我国民族工业 (undermine our national industry). The national industries in Shanghai generally operated at insufficient capacity, and a large number of factories went bankrupt and workers lost their jobs. For example, in 1934, the operating rate of Shanghai factories was 75% for the cotton textile industry and only 70% for the match industry, and even lower for the rubber industry, only 35%. In order to compete with imperialism, national industries had to lower the prices of their products.

In addition, due to the increase in workers' wages and the purchase prices of raw materials since liberation, the cost of industry has also increased. Therefore, the prices of some industrial products are relatively high.

Before liberation, Shanghai was also a base for imperialist countries to exploit our labor force cheaply. They opened many factories in Shanghai, and workers' wages were extremely low. According to statistics from nine industries including electrical machinery, shipbuilding, and cigarettes, the average monthly wage of workers before liberation was 20 yuan and 91 fen, equivalent to 315 jin of rice. Among them, the average wage of textile factory workers was only 10 yuan and 5 fen, equivalent to 151 jin of rice. The average wage of match factory workers was only 11 yuan and 71 fen, equivalent to 177 jin of rice. Apprentices earned 5 yuan a month, and their lives were like those of cattle and horses. After liberation, workers' wages have been increased. The average wage of the above nine industries in 1956 was 65 yuan and 49 fen, equivalent to 439 jin of rice. The increase in workers' wages has also increased the cost of industry. In addition, in order to accelerate the accumulation of funds for national industrial construction, the tax rates on some industrial products have also been increased. The state increases industrial product tax revenue without increasing agricultural product tax revenue, which is beneficial to peasants, because industrial product tax rates are borne by the whole people. In order to develop domestic raw material production so that Shanghai's industry no longer relies on imported raw materials such as American cotton as it did before liberation, the purchase prices of some raw materials have also been increased after liberation. These two items have also increased the cost of industrial products.

"Last year, the prices of many industrial products increased, but the prices of agricultural products did not increase, which is too unreasonable." In the discussion, everyone believed that the price adjustments of some commodities last year were actually beneficial to peasants. This is because most of the price increases were for high-end commodities such as woolens and high-end cigarettes, which generally do not harm the interests of peasants. Only salt has a greater relationship with peasants, but the price only increased by 2 fen per jin, and the increase in burden per person per year is less than 2 jiao. However, the prices of many commodities transported and sold to rural areas decreased last year, such as grade C and D cigarettes, which decreased by 8.8%, and new agricultural implements and medicines for treating local diseases (such as medicines for treating hookworm and schistosomiasis) all decreased in price. At the same time, the state also increased the purchase prices of live pigs and oil crops. After the opening of the free market, the prices of local and special products in rural areas also rose. These directly or relatively increased the income of peasants.

The discussion finally came down to: should we universally lower the prices of industrial products and increase the prices of agricultural products now? Can this improve the lives of peasants? The result of the discussion was: this cannot be done based on people's subjective wishes, but must be determined according to objective conditions. Lowering the prices of industrial products must be based on the development of production and an abundant supply of industrial products. For example, in the past, most of Shanghai's medicines relied on imports. After liberation, Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry developed rapidly, and the vast majority are now manufactured by ourselves. Therefore, the prices of medicines have decreased a lot in the past two years, and there are still conditions to continue to reduce them. However, most of Shanghai's industrial products are currently insufficient, and production cannot increase in the short term. Lowering prices will cause serious shortages, and the result will be forced to raise prices again, or create a chaotic situation such as black markets. There are currently no conditions for universally increasing the prices of agricultural products. If they are forcibly increased, the burden on the people will increase, and prices cannot be stabilized, which is very dangerous. It is not conducive to the country and the people, and naturally not conducive to peasants.

The state's multifaceted support for peasants proves that there is no unfairness in the treatment of workers and peasants.

Other issues were also discussed in this discussion, such as "Is the state's treatment of workers and peasants unfair, demanding more from agriculture and providing less support and assistance?" Everyone opened the books again to see if the state does not support agriculture? From 1954 to 1956, the state collected 9,592,237 yuan in agricultural tax from peasants in the Shanghai suburbs. From 1955 to 1957, the state spent 11,444,000 yuan on establishing tractor stations, pumping stations, electric irrigation networks, water conservancy projects, agricultural technology extension stations, wired broadcasting, etc., in the suburbs. Since liberation, state banks have loaned peasants 17,100,000 yuan, and peasants still owe the state 4,490,000 yuan in overdue and unpaid loans. That is to say, the state's investment in the suburbs exceeds the amount collected from suburban peasants by more than 18,000,000 yuan. This figure shows that the state fully supports suburban agriculture, and the working class supports the peasant brothers, not providing less support but providing a lot of support. People also said that the state's and the working class's support for peasants should not only be viewed from an economic perspective, but also from a political perspective, such as the state leading peasants to implement cooperation, opening up a broad road to permanently eliminate exploitation and move towards prosperity. It put forward the Outline for Agricultural Development for the next twelve years, planning the direction of agricultural development. This year, the state has further proposed the construction policy of promoting industry and agriculture in parallel, which is the greatest support.

In the discussion on worker-peasant relations, everyone believed that some of the opinions reflected by peasants are still correct, that is, the wages of apprentices, young workers, temporary workers, and odd-job workers in the current workers are too high, and peasants are not satisfied. For example, they said that the workers in the cowhide warehouse near the NanDa Cooperative are mostly from the countryside. They move things around and earn 50 or 60 yuan, or even 70 or 80 yuan, a month. Some young people enter factories from the countryside and earn 40 or 50 yuan a month, wearing watches and woolen trousers. However, this type of person is not the majority among workers, and the state has also noticed this problem and will gradually improve it in the future.

In this way, through the analysis, debate, comparison, and accounting of specific issues one by one, many people's ideological knots were untied. They also examined the roots of these muddled ideas, believing that the main culprit was absolute egalitarianism and departmentalism, only seeing the partial and immediate interests of peasants, and not seeing the fundamental and long-term interests of peasants, "seemingly standing on the side of the peasants, but in fact not truly representing the interests of the peasants." At the same time, it also reflects a vague understanding of national industrialization and a one-sided and narrow way of thinking. After the debate, many people happily said: "In the past, when talking about the worker-peasant alliance, my own thinking was not very clear, and I often couldn't convince peasants. This method of debate is good, with many reasons and materials, strong persuasiveness, and I am convinced from the bottom of my heart. In the future, I will have the capital to debate with others."

    国家对工人和农民同等重视一样关心
    上海市委召开郊区三级干部会议辩论工农联盟问题的大是大非
    本报讯　记者季音报道：不久前，在中共上海市委召开的一次农村三级干部会议上，展开了一场有关工农联盟问题的思想大交锋。
    工人和农民的生活解放后都有较大改善，目前还保持着合理的差别
    大交锋首先是从“农民生活苦”挑起来的。会议一开始，一部分以“农民的代言人”自居的干部，就发出了一连串的愤愤不平声：“农民的生活苦，工人的生活好，国家太亏待农民了”，“工人三层楼，农民一层楼，相差太悬殊”……
      “农民的生活到底苦不苦？”讨论中，大家认为这个问题的提法太含糊，应当说得更明白一些，如果笼统地说苦，那末我们国家今天生产还落后，不但农民生活清苦，工人、干部的生活也还清苦，都有笔苦账。如果说农民今天仍和过去一样苦，那就完全不是事实。
    这个问题是比较容易弄明白的，因为会上的许多农村干部本身就有一笔翻身账，上海郊区农民解放后生活的蒸蒸日上，他们也是目击者。会上人们举出了许多生动的事实：解放前的“陈家白墙”（村庄名）并没有白墙，现在真造起白墙瓦房了；过去许多农民吃麦头饭，现在都吃大米饭，磨麦头的石磨和石臼都变成磨刀石和水桥板了，东郊星光社第六生产队的六个石磨、六个石臼都改派了这种用场；过去郊区农民生活是“一篮青菜八两米，只见青菜不见米”，现在像西郊虹星一分社三百一十八户纯农户中，已有88％的农民过着富裕农民的生活，去年每人平均收入一百七十八元，平均每户收入八百五十八元。过去农民根本享受不到文化生活，现在看电影、听广播，还有俱乐部，各乡有卫生所、联合诊所，治疗血吸虫病……。
    当然，郊区也有比过去苦的人，他们是地主、富农、一部分懒汉和少数丧失劳动力的人。但绝大部分农民生活比过去改善得多了，这一点，人们争论不大。
    争论多的是工农生活是不是悬殊很大？人们从各方面进行了比较，他们发现，大家举出工人生活太好的例子，大都是一些没有结婚、没有家庭负担的青年工人，或者家在农村的工人，而一般工人和农民生活虽有差别，但并不大。而且郊区有一部分农民的收入还比工人高，西郊虹星三分社去年平均每人收入二百二十九元，平均每户收入八百二十一元，而1956年全国职工平均工资只有六百一十元，如以一家四口人计算，平均每人一年只有一百五十二元的收入，远没有虹星社农民多。上海有不少工人，如清洁总队的四千多工人，颗粒肥料厂的工人，很多收入不及郊区农民。
    人们还算了一笔账：上海郊区农民每人每年平均收入是九十九元，以一户五人计算，近五百元。如果工人每月工资六十元，一年是七百二十元，这样看来好像相差二百多元，但城市、农村生活水平不一样。城市里的工人，柴草、蔬菜、鸡蛋等都要花钱买，而农村里常常不用去买。城市里的工人还有许多农民所没有的开支，如水电、房租、工会费、看弄堂、倒马桶、交通费等。这样一算，工农收入的差别就很小了，决不是什么“天上地下”。
      “农民种棉花，工人加工，双方都劳动，收入应当同等，为什么要有差别？”“说工人劳动大，难道农民挑扛耕地，劳动不大吗？如果按劳取酬，就应当平等！”周龙祥等几个人进一步提出问题，他们不同意工农生活水平应有差别。但是更多的人认为工农生活水平如果悬殊很大是不利于工农联盟的，工人阶级要主动注意这个问题，在生活福利上不能有过高的要求。不过，工农生活水平保持合理的差别也是对的。他们举了一些上海工厂的调查材料来说明：工人的劳动生产率比农民要高得多，创造的经济价值大，而他们所享受的只占很小部分，如上海汽轮机厂一年创造净产值二千三百七十一万元，但工人工资、福利支出仅三百二十四万元，尚有二千零四十七万元都是国家收入，占全部净产值86.3％。别的工厂的材料，也大都如此。人们又拿上海郊区的材料来对比，郊区1956年的总产值是六千七百九十万元，除去35％的生产成本，创造净产值四千多万元，交农业税二百九十二万元，只占创造价值的7％，农民自己享受的达93％。这两个调查材料，使大家认识到了两种劳动的不同，他们说，工农收入的差别，就好比农业社里记工分也有高低，社里如果死分死记，大家干起来就会没劲。当然，这个材料的对比，只是为的说明工农生活所以有差别的由来。至于农民对国家的贡献、对工业的支援，自然不能只从农业税一项来看的。
    还有的农民说工人干活“写意”，实际上是“没有尝到滋味不知苦”，1954年郊区有些农村干部调去做营业员，去了不久都吵着要回来，说“一天站到晚，腿也酸死了。”
    国家努力帮助农民改善生活，农民要使生活更有保障，要靠发展生产
    “工农生活差得不大，差一点也对，这点我们通了，但是我们农民的生活没有工人的生活有保障，他们的工资是‘天打不落’，还有劳保福利，农民什么也没有，天灾来了就受苦，这一点我们还是不通。”人们又提出了新的问题。
    农民的生活没有保障吗？大家在讨论中回忆解放前郊区农民的生活确实是毫无保障的，冻死饿死的年年有，都没人管。现在已完全不同了，大家举了许多例子，如去年刮大台风，区长亲自下来，带着钱救济灾民，二塘乡被龙卷风刮倒一百多间房子，国家就拨款五万元，帮助农民造了一百一十三间房子，压伤的人全部医好了。结果这年受损失最重的第五社，98％的社员都增加了收入。说到看病，也不知比过去好了多少，农民周林根生了急病，一打电话救护车就来，医院分期付款、免费。另外大家还谈到，政府几年来在郊区修水利，建设电力灌溉，拖拉机站，发贷款……，都是为了保障农民的生活，去年郊区遭到严重的自然灾害，农副业总产值比丰收的1955年还增加11.3％，有65％的农户增加了收入，20％的农户不增不减，只有15％的户略有下降，这不就是保障了农民的生活么？
    接着大家又谈到：农民的生活保障条件现在确实要比工人差一些，收入还不能完全稳定，但这是两种生产不同的关系。工人的福利也是从自己的劳动中得来的，他们劳动生产率高，给国家生产的财富多，福利自然就好些。农民要使生活更有保障，就得更加发展生产，逐步增加合作社的公共积累，这是提高福利的根本。人们并举了些例子，说明有的社生产好，福利就好得多。福利不能光依赖政府，得依靠自己从劳动中来得到。
    工农业产品的差价比解放前缩小了，随便降低和提高对国计民生都不利
    “工业品太贵，农产品太便宜，农民吃亏太大。”这是讨论中提出的又一个大问题。有人甚至直接提出：要加强工农联盟，就得提高农产品价格，降低工业品价格。
    工农业产品的差价比过去扩大了吗？参加这次讨论的商业部门的同志提出许多材料，证明和解放前比较，上海郊区工农业产品的差价一般不是扩大而是缩小了。这是因为解放后人民政府采取措施稳定了物价，使工业品基本上维持原有水平，农产品收购价格作了适当提高。从下面这个材料中可以看出：一百斤中白粳在1956年和1946年，同几种主要工业品交换比例的变化是：
                在1946年可换　在1956年可换十二磅龙头细布　五○·三九尺　五九·八八尺美丽短梗火柴  　四九·四四封  八九·一二封固本肥皂　      七七·二八块　九一·四○块榴花砂白糖　    二二·六一斤　二四·三六斤
    在讨论中人们也承认，有的工农业产品差价如果和抗战前比，是扩大了一些。但这里有许多原因须要作具体的分析，不能笼统地说现在就不合理。例如抗战前有的工业品价格偏低，是一种不正常的现象，那时候上海是帝国主义国家商品倾销的市场，他们利用政治上和经济上的优势，低价推销商品，打击我国民族工业。上海的民族工业普遍开工不足，大批工厂倒闭，工人失业。如1934年，上海工厂的开工率，棉纺业是75％，火柴业仅70％，橡胶业更低，只有35％。民族工业为了和帝国主义竞争，也不得不压低产品价格。
    另外，由于解放后工人的工资和原料收购价格都提高了，工业的成本也随之加大。因此，有些工业品的价格比较高。
    解放前的上海，也是一个帝国主义国家廉价剥削我国劳动力的基地，他们在上海开设了许多工厂，工人工资极低，据机电、造船、卷烟等九个行业统计，解放前工人平均每月工资是二十元九角一分，合三百一十五斤米。其中纺织厂工人平均工资只有十元零五分，合一百五十一斤米。火柴厂平均工资只有十一元七角一分，合一百七十七斤米。养成工是五元钱一个月，生活像牛马一般。解放后，工人工资得到了提高，上述九个行业1956年平均工资是六十五元四角九分，合大米四百三十九斤。工人工资的提高，工业成本也就增加了。另外，为了加速积累国家工业建设的资金，现在部分工业品的税率也有提高，国家增加工业品税收，不增加农业品税收，这是有利于农民的，因为工业品税率是由全民来负担的。为了发展国内的原料生产，使上海的工业不再像解放前那样大部分依靠美国棉花等进口原料，解放后也提高了一些原料收购价格。这两项，也都加大了工业品的成本。
    “去年许多工业品价格提高了，农产品价格不提高，这太不合理。”在讨论中大家认为：去年一些商品价格的调整，对农民来说实际上是有利的。因为涨价的大多数是呢绒、高档卷烟等高档商品，一般不损害农民利益。只有食盐和农民关系较大，但每斤只涨二分，每个人全年负担增加不到二角钱。而去年许多运销农村的商品价格下降了，如丙丁级卷烟降低8.8％，新式农具，治地方性病的药物（如治钩虫病、血吸虫病的药品），价格都降了很多。国家同时又调高了毛猪、油料的收购价格。自由市场开放后，农村土特产品的价格也上涨了。这些都直接的或相对的增加了农民的收入。
    讨论最后归结到：现在应不应当普遍降低工业品价格，提高农产品价格？是不是这样就能改善农民的生活？讨论结果是：这不能凭人们的主观愿望办事，而要根据客观的条件来决定。降低工业品价格必须建立在生产发展、工业品供应充沛的基础上，譬如上海的药品过去大部分是依赖进口的，解放后上海制药工业发展很快，绝大多数都自己制造了，因此近二年来药品价格降低很多，而且目前还有条件可以继续降低。但目前上海工业品大部分不足，生产又不可能短期内增长，降低价格就会造成严重脱销，结果不是重新被迫提高价格，或者就产生黑市等纷乱局面。普遍提高农产品价格目前也没有条件，硬提高了，就会使人民负担增加，物价不能稳定，那是非常危险的。不利于国家和人民，自然也不利于农民。
    国家对农民多方面的支持证明对工人和农民的待遇没有什么不公平
    这次讨论中还谈到了其它的一些问题，例如“国家对工农的待遇是不是不公平，对农业要得多，支持帮助少？”大家又摊开了账，看国家是不是不支持农业？上海郊区从1954年到1956年三年中，国家向郊区农民收的农业税是九百五十九万二千二百三十七元，而在1955年到1957年三年中，国家在郊区建立拖拉机站、抽水机站、电力灌溉网、兴修水利、农业技术推广站、有线广播等，共用去一千一百四十四万四千元，解放以来国家银行贷款给农民一千七百一十万元，到现在农民欠国家到期应还而未还的各种贷款还有四百四十九万元，这就是说，国家给郊区的投资比从郊区农民那里收进的超过了一千八百多万元，这个数字，说明国家对郊区农业是完全支持的，工人阶级对农民弟兄是支持的，不是支持少而是支持得很多。人们还说，国家和工人阶级对农民的支持，不仅要从经济上看，还要从政治上看，如国家领导农民实行了合作化，开辟了永远摆脱剥削、走向富裕的康庄大道。提出了今后十二年农业发展纲要，规划了农业发展的方向。今年国家又进一步提出了工农业并举的建设方针，这些都是最大的支持。
    在工农关系的讨论中，大家认为农民们反映的有一部分意见还是正确的，这就是目前工人中的学徒工、青工、临时工、杂务工等的工资偏高，农民们不满意。例如他们说南大社附近牛皮仓库工人，多是从农村去的，搬搬弄弄，一个月就是五、六十元，甚至七、八十元。有的青年人从农村进了工厂，一进去就是四、五十元一个月，戴起了手表，穿上呢裤子。但是，这类人在工人中并不是多数，国家也已经注意到这个问题，今后将要逐步加以改进。
    这次讨论就这样经过一个个具体问题的分析，辩论，对比，算账，许多人的思想结子解开了。他们还检查了产生这些糊涂思想的根源，认为主要是绝对平均主义思想和本位主义思想作怪，只看到农民的局部和眼前利益，不看到农民的根本、长远利益，“自己好像站在农民这边，事实上并不真正代表农民的利益。”同时也反映了对国家工业化的思想模糊，思想方法片面、狭隘。经过辩论，许多人心情愉快地说：“过去谈工农联盟，自己思想不大通，也常常说服不了农民，这次采取辩论的办法好，道理多，材料多，说服力强，心里服服贴贴，以后同别人再辩论就有本钱了。”
