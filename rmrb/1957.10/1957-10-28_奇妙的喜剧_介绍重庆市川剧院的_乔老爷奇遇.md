    Wonderful Comedy
    — Introducing the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Troupe's "The Strange Adventures of Lord Qiao"
    Dai Bufan
    An evil young master tries to seize a girl, but ends up bringing back a husband for his own sister; a successful candidate going to the capital for the imperial examination – in the performance, he is a clown with white powder on his nose, being carried in a sedan chair and mistaken for the bride... Such hilarious content is entirely worthy of the level of "legendary." However, a work that merely relies on "mistakes leading to wonders" is ultimately prone to cliché and difficult to rank among the best. I believe the "The Strange Adventures of Lord Qiao" (originally titled "Huangjie Post Station" or "Lord Qiao Eats Sesame Seed Cake"), performed by the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Troupe, is a top-quality, wonderful comedy, based not only on its captivating comedic plot but also on the appearance, in this amusing story, of a lovable character – the young successful candidate, Lord Qiao Xi.
    The unpredictable and surprising arrangement of scenes adds to the unique splendor of this comedy. Consider this: Lord Qiao, suddenly inspired by the sound of gongs and drums from a temple fair on the shore, finishes his visit to the temple. Seeing that it's getting late, and fearing that his fellow examinees on the boat are waiting too long, he sings the "next line": "Hurriedly I rush to the riverside to find the boat," while walking directly to the stage entrance in a circle – at this point, according to the usual stage setting of opera, everyone would assume the scene is over. But no. Lord Qiao suddenly and hastily walks back onto the stage, pacing and thinking: "Oh dear, where did I get off the boat?" – it turns out he can't find his way back. All he can remember is: the boat was originally docked under a willow tree, but now it seems that even the willow tree has sailed away with the boat. We would feel great sympathy for a three-foot-tall child who can't find their way back; but Qiao Xi is a successful candidate, and according to his age, status, and life experience, he shouldn't be unable to find his way back; how incongruous his actions are with his status as a lord! He was only thinking of going ashore to play, without considering that he had to return to the boat. It is in this uncommon stage setting that the playwright allows us to see Qiao Xi's image amid laughter.
    The author's pen is almost like a skillful magician, making you tense one moment and relaxed the next. He pays full attention to the alternating "cold" and "hot" arrangements of scenes, and is adept at bringing his protagonist out calmly and peacefully at the most critical moments, allowing people to take a breath and see his true face clearly. The scene where the young master Lan Musi leads his servants in pursuit of Miss Huang, and suddenly encounters the weary and wounded Lord Qiao at dusk, thus demonstrating that he is a poor scholar who doesn't give much consideration to the pain of Lan's servants' fists, or the power of the son of a high official, or the consequences of being taken to court, is a good example. Then, lodging at Huangjie Post Station further exemplifies this point. Lan Musi chases the Huang family mother and daughter to Huangjie Post Station to stay; planning to have his family carry her away as soon as she gets into the sedan chair at midnight. The audience is holding their breath, waiting for this serious event to happen, but the author gives us another twist: Lord Qiao, almost forgotten by us, appears again, hobbling with a leg injury. He is penniless, with nowhere to stay. Darkness, hunger, fatigue, and pain are all upon him. Just as he is at a loss for what to do, he suddenly touches Miss Huang's sedan chair and then gets into the sedan chair and falls sound asleep. — Originally, we were most concerned about Miss Huang's fate and thought that Lord Qiao was merely an interlude in the play, but when Lord Qiao enters the sedan chair, no one will pay more attention to Miss Huang's fate, but will concentrate on watching Lord Qiao in the sedan chair. Because this gentleman, who calls himself "content with his lot and happy in it," is the "bride" who is about to be carried away by Lan Musi! In this way, this author, who is exceptionally proficient in dramatic structure, seamlessly integrates the two threads of the play with a gentle stroke. The author wants to write about Lord Qiao, but he deliberately mystifies, so that when the audience is extremely concerned about the persecuted Miss Huang, he gently and humorously pushes the character of Lord Qiao to the forefront. He is truly good at using his swirling and ever-changing pen!
    The author's purpose in writing this play is certainly not to simply criticize evil young masters like Lan Musi, or just to make the audience laugh. If his intention were only limited to this, then simply making such arrangements would achieve the intended purpose: Lan Musi opens the sedan chair curtain on the road and sees that the "bride" is actually a male clown; or, he simply carries the sedan chair back to the Lan mansion and discovers that the "bride" is the very fellow who bumped into his horse yesterday. However, the author does not write it this way directly; immediately following the previous scene, he seizes the character Lord Qiao, who is now the most watched by the audience, and writes the wonderful scene of "eating sesame seed cakes," giving the fullest depiction of Lord Qiao's righteous character.
    The scene of parking the sedan chair under the Chinese banyan tree and waiting for dawn is no less comedic than "Jiang Gan Steals the Letter." Lan Musi, eager to marry Miss Huang, complains that the sky "doesn't brighten faster"; Lan Xin, believing he has done a good job, asks the young master for a generous reward. – They all believe that this time they have finally gotten this peerless beauty into their hands. However, the one who sticks his head out from the sedan chair curtain is actually a poor scholar with an unremarkable appearance and white powder on his nose! — What a funny comedic conflict this is! At this point, Lord Qiao, who has been sleeping soundly in the sedan chair for half the night, suddenly realizes that he has been carried here as Miss Huang. However, at this point, the audience still cannot understand what kind of person Lord Qiao is? At the moment when the audience most eagerly seeks the answer, the playwright and the actors finally reveal the mystery: from Lord Qiao's hatred, fear, desire to leave, and finally his decision to stay and stand up for justice, in this realistic and detailed inner struggle, we see a scholar, but a scholar with a sense of justice. But, not to mention now, when he is surrounded by wolf-like servants, empty-handed, with a leg injury, an empty stomach (he didn't even get dinner!), and exhausted, even in normal times, it would be reckless for a poor scholar to confront the powerful son of a high official! In a word, what Lord Qiao decided to do is fundamentally disproportionate to his own power. But, because what he is going to do is a righteous thing, we will feel his spiritual nobility and lovability amid laughter.
    According to the above analysis, this act of standing up for justice cannot be done. However, this witty and talented folk author has made an unexpected and ingenious arrangement here: Lord Qiao stamps his foot, and a set of clothes and a box of sesame seed cakes hanging on the top of the sedan chair fall down, hitting him on the head. "Lord Qiao only wants sesame seed cakes to eat, you can carry me to heaven if you want to." So he wolfs them down, happily eating the sesame seed cakes (the actor has excellent skills here). — In the midst of poverty and hardship, Lord Qiao never loses his optimistic and calm humorous demeanor. After eating his fill of sesame seed cakes, his spirits are lifted, and in a situation where there is no solution, a wonderful idea arises naturally: he might as well put on Miss Huang's clothes and disguise himself as the bride. The dignified successful candidate forgets himself and uses a way that is completely incompatible with his identity, status, character, gender, and appearance — dressing up as a "beautiful woman" — to engage in a serious undertaking: standing up for justice and saving people. Although, Lord Qiao seems to have thought about it carefully, considering how to escape after being carried into the mansion. However, hearing the rooster crow three times, he still has no plan, so he simply stops thinking about it: "Bah! He can't force me to kowtow!" Recalling that he didn't bother to remember the way back when he went ashore; he insisted on taking the Lan young master to court, regardless of other consequences; it is even clearer that this person with a sense of justice, when he encounters something he believes he should do, he does it very calmly. He rarely considers the consequences of doing so.
    Lan Musi's failure and Lord Qiao's victory are now destined. However, this brilliant legendary author deeply understands the audience's psychology and does not end his good play hastily. Lord Qiao is led into Miss Lan's bedroom, and they discover that they are the people who showed affection for each other in the temple yesterday (there is a very funny and detailed description here, which will not be elaborated on). Lan Musi runs into the room… At this point in the play, it could end as soon as Lan Musi lifts the "bride's" head covering. However, the author does not do this. He lets Miss Lan run to tell her mother, then the guests come on stage, Lan Gongzi comes out wearing a bright red auspicious robe, excitedly preparing to pay respects; finally, Lan's mother, in a fit of anger, calls out the "newcomer" — Lord Qiao, and Miss Lan to pay respects to heaven and earth and get married. In this way, Lan Musi suddenly falls from his most triumphant moment into the most disappointing situation, which is the opposite of what he imagined. This is not only richer in comedic meaning, but also makes Lan Musi even more embarrassed. At the same time, the ending of Lord Qiao and Miss Lan paying respects to heaven and earth amidst the sound of drums and music also conforms to the "happy reunion" structure of legends; this is more joyful than ending the play in Miss Lan's room.
    This excellent comedy was directed by Li Wenjie, a famous clown actor of Sichuan opera. Li Wenjie himself plays Lan Gongzi in the play; although this role is difficult to give full play to his superb acting skills, he plays this ugly young master appropriately, especially vividly expressing Lan Musi's inner state of being both anxious and concerned about his identity and status. If Lan Gongzi was only anxious, then the secret of the "bride" in the sedan chair would have been revealed on the road long ago. Taking care of his own reputation is indispensable for playing Lan Gongzi. The image of Lord Qiao on the stage is that of a clown, but the actor Li Wenyun was originally a young male lead. This unique arrangement, on the one hand, makes Lord Qiao's image have the humor, wit, and gentleness unique to Sichuan opera clowns, and on the other hand, it also has the bookishness and poor scholar aura unique to poor male leads in Sichuan opera. And this is indispensable for Lord Qiao, who is penniless. Li Wenyun, who plays the clown and adds the role of a female lead, has completed the task very well. In addition, Ping Ping, who plays Miss Lan, and Wang Qinglian, who plays the landlady, are also very expressive and good actors.

    奇妙的喜剧
    ——介绍重庆市川剧院的“乔老爷奇遇”
    戴不凡
    一个恶公子想抢一个姑娘，结果，却给自己的妹妹抬回个丈夫；一个上京赴试的举人，——在演出中，他是个鼻上涂着白粉的丑角，坐在轿内被人抬去错作新娘；……如此令人哄堂的内容，已完全够得上“传奇”的水平了。然而，仅仅是一部“错中见奇”的作品，那终究是易入窠臼，难列上品的。我以为重庆市川剧院演出的“乔老爷奇遇”（原名“黄界驿”或“乔老爷吃酥饼”），是一本上品的奇妙喜剧，其根据不止在于它的诱人喜剧情节，同时更在于这使人忍俊不已的故事中，出现了一位令人喜爱的人物——年青的举人老爷乔溪。
    变化莫测，出人意外，难以窥其底细的场次安排，使这个喜剧，更添加了它特有的丰彩。你看，因听岸上庙会锣鼓而忽动游兴的乔老爷游完了寺，看看天色不早，唯恐船上的考伴久等，一边唱着“下句”：“急忙忙奔江边去把船寻”，一边绕场直走到上场门口，——这时，按照戏曲的通常排场，谁都会以为这场戏是完了。然而，不。乔老爷忽然又匆匆地走出场来，边走边思索：“哎呀，我是从那里下的船呀？”——原来他找不到归路了。他唯一能记得起的是：船原来停在一棵柳树下面，但现在似乎连柳树也跟船一块儿开走了。一个三尺之童找不到归途，我们会寄予莫大同情；但乔溪是一位举人老爷啊，按照他的年龄、身份和生活经验，他是不应当找不到归路的；他的行动跟他的老爷身份是如何的不调和啊！一心上岸游玩时，却没有想到自己还要回船。就在这不常见的排场中，剧作者让我们在笑声中看到了乔溪的形象。
    作者的笔几乎像巧妙的魔术师一般，忽而使你紧张，忽而使你轻松，他充分注意到场子安排上的“冷”、“热”更替，善于在最紧急的关头，把他的主人公安祥、平静地端出场来，让人松一口气地看清他的真面貌。在公子蓝木斯率领家丁沿途紧紧追赶黄小姐时，突然安排日暮穷途的乔老爷和蓝木斯相撞受伤，从而表现这是个不太考虑面前蓝家家丁的拳头痛不痛、天官之子有多大威势、拉去见官的后果如何的穷酸举子，是一个很好的例子。接着，黄界驿的投宿则更鲜明地表现了这一点。蓝木斯追赶黄家母女到黄界驿投店；准备等她半夜一上轿，立刻由家人抬起就走。观众在屏声息气地等待这一严重事件的发生，不料，作者又卖了一下关子：几乎被我们遗忘了的乔老爷，扶着腿伤，又踽踽地出现了。他囊无分文，无处投宿，天黑、饥饿、疲乏、伤痛集于一身，正在进退无路的时候，忽然摸到黄小姐的轿子，于是，就坐进轿里酣睡起来。——原来我们最关心的是黄小姐的遭遇；并认为乔老爷不过是剧中的穿插而已，可是，当乔老爷一进轿子，谁都不会再去更多地注意黄小姐的命运，而要集中精力看着轿内的乔老爷了。因为，这位自称是“随遇而安，乐在其中矣”的酸而又丑的君子，才是立刻就要被蓝木斯抬走的“新娘”啊！这样，这位异常精通戏剧结构的作者，轻轻一笔，就把剧中两条线索天衣无缝似地集中在一起了。作者要写乔老爷，然而他却故弄玄虚，使人在极度关心被迫害的黄小姐的情况下，才轻轻地、诙谐地把乔老爷这个人物推到观众的最前面，他真善于运用他翻腾变幻之笔！
    作者写这个戏的目的，决不是为了单纯地批判蓝木斯这样的恶公子，或者仅仅为了使观众大笑一场。如果他的用意只尽于此，那么，只要做这样的安排就能达到预定的目的了；蓝木斯在路上掀开轿帘，一看“新娘”原是个男的小丑；或，径将轿子抬回蓝府，发现“新娘”原就是昨天撞马头的那厮。可是，作者并没有直截了当地这样写；紧接着上一场，他抓住观众现在最瞩目的人物乔老爷，写了“吃酥饼”这一场精彩好戏，把乔老爷的正义性格作了最充分的描绘。
    黄桷树下驻轿等天明这场戏，喜剧性决不亚于“蒋干盗书”。急于想和黄小姐成亲的蓝木斯在埋怨天“咋个不快些亮嘛”；自以为办事有功的蓝心会则要求公子重赏。——他们脑海中都以为这一番终于把这位其貌无双的佳人搞到手了。可是，从轿帘内伸出头来的却是个其貌不扬、鼻涂白粉的穷酸书生！——这是何等风趣的喜剧性冲突！到这时，在轿内酣睡了半夜的乔老爷，才恍然大悟，自己已被当作黄小姐抬来了。然而，到这时，观众还不能了解乔老爷究竟是何等人物？就在观众最迫切期求答案的时刻，剧作者和演员终于把谜底揭开了：从乔老爷痛恨，害怕，要走，终至于决定留下来打抱不平，这一真实细致的内心斗争的过程中，我们看见了一个书生，但却是个有正义感的书生面貌。但是，别说是现在，他处在如狼似虎的家丁包围中，赤手空拳，腿有伤痛，腹内空空（连晚饭也没弄到吃呢！），身疲力尽，即使在平时，一个穷酸举子要碰一下声势赫赫的天官公子，这也是不自量力的行动啊！一句话，乔老爷决定要做的事，跟他本人所有的力量，根本是不相称的。但是，由于他所要做的是一件正义的事，所以我们会在欢笑声中感觉其精神的崇高可爱。
    按照上面的分析，这抱不平原是没法打的。但是，这位诙谐和富有才情的民间作者，在这里却作了出人意料的奇巧安排：乔老爷一顿足，黄小姐挂在轿顶上的一套衣裙和一盒酥饼落下来，打中了他的脑壳。“乔老爷只要酥饼吃，随你把我抬上天都要得”。他于是狼吞虎咽，欢天喜地地大吃起酥饼来（演员在此有绝妙的技术）。——在穷愁困厄之中，乔老爷就这样永远不失其乐观和泰然的诙谐风度。他吃饱酥饼，精神一振，在一无办法之中，绝妙的主意便自然而然产生了：索性把黄小姐的衣裙穿在自己身上，改装作新娘。堂堂举人老爷，就这样忘我地用跟自己身份、地位、性格、性别、面貌完全不调和的方式——装扮成为一个“女佳人”，从事一件严肃的事业：打抱不平、救人。虽然，乔老爷这一番似乎是仔细了一些，想了一下被抬进府以后如何脱身。可是，听见金鸡三唱，仍无计策，他也就干脆不再去多想了：“?！他总不能跟我拜堂！”回想一下：他上岸时不去认记归路；定要拉蓝公子去告状而不计其他；更可见这位富于正义感的人物，碰到了自认为应做的事，他就十分泰然地去做。他很少去考虑这样做的后果。
    蓝木斯的失败和乔老爷的胜利，现在是注定的了。但是，这位高明的传奇作者，是深懂观众心理的，并不把他的这部好戏草草收场。乔老爷被引进蓝小姐的卧房中，彼此发现就是昨天在寺中相互留情的人（在这里有很风趣和细致的描写，不详述）。蓝木斯跑进房来，……戏演至此，只要蓝木斯把“新娘”的头盖一揭去，便可终场了。然而，作者并没有这样做。他让蓝小姐去奔告母亲，接着，众宾客上场，蓝公子穿着大红吉服兴高采烈地出来，准备拜堂；最后，由怒气冲冲的蓝母，喊出“新人”——乔老爷，和蓝小姐拜堂成亲。这样，蓝木斯在最得意的时刻，突然落到和他设想截然相反的最失意境遇中去，不仅更富于喜剧意味，而且使蓝木斯更加狼狈不堪。同时，在鼓乐声中，由乔老爷和蓝小姐拜天地结束，也符合传奇“大团圆”的结构；这比在蓝小姐房中结束全剧，更是喜气洋洋。
    这个出色的喜剧，是由川剧名丑李文杰导演的。李文杰自己在剧中演蓝公子；虽然这个角色很难发挥他的精湛演技，但是，他把这位丑恶公子演得恰如其分，特别是很传神地表达蓝木斯既焦急，又顾全自己身份地位的内心状态。如果蓝公子只是焦急，那么，轿内“新娘”的秘密早就在路上被揭穿了。顾全自己名誉这一点，对演蓝公子来说，是不可缺少的。乔老爷在台上的形象是个丑角，但演员李文韵则原是小生。这个别致的安排，一方面既使乔老爷的形象具有川剧丑角特有的幽默、诙谐、温文尔雅，同时，又具有川剧穷生身上那种特有的书卷气和穷酸劲儿。而这一点，对于囊空如洗的乔老爷来说，更是不可缺少的。小生扮丑再“加”旦角，李文韵把任务完成得很好。另外，演蓝小姐的苹萍和店妈的王清廉，也都是很能传神的好演员。
