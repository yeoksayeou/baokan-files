Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respected Dr. Mohammad Hatta, Your Excellency Ambassador, Ladies and Gentlemen:

On the eve of Dr. Hatta's departure from Beijing to visit other parts of our country, I would like to express, once again on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, our heartfelt thanks for Dr. Hatta's visit.

Dr. Hatta, your visit to our country is of great significance to the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian people. Although our meeting this time is short, your deep friendship for the Chinese people and your deep concern for China's construction have left a deep impression on the Chinese people. The several speeches you have made since arriving in China, advocating the maintenance of world peace and the strengthening of friendly cooperation between China and Indonesia, have further increased the Chinese people's admiration for you. We share the same belief as Your Excellency, that countries with different ideologies and political systems can coexist peacefully. We also agree with your proposal for a twenty-five-year peace agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Chinese people are willing to work with the Indonesian people and peace-loving people all over the world to implement and develop the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the resolutions of the Bandung Conference.

Dr. Hatta, your friendly visit to China with other distinguished Indonesian guests comes at a time when the Chinese people are striving to overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan. You have seen how arduous the work is for the Chinese people to overcome the economic and cultural backwardness left over from history. The Indonesian people are also advancing along the road of developing an independent national economy. In order to achieve this goal, the Indonesian government has formulated a five-year construction plan. We sincerely hope that the mutual learning and mutual assistance between the people of the two countries in construction will be further strengthened.

Wherever you go in China, you will feel the Chinese people's sincere affection and high respect for the Indonesian people, who have a glorious tradition of national revolution. The Chinese people have always sympathized with the Indonesian people's heroic struggle against colonial oppression and for the maintenance of their national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We firmly support your just struggle to recover West Irian and believe that you will achieve complete victory.

Dr. Hatta, as you are about to leave Beijing, I would like to express my deep regret at parting with you and all the distinguished Indonesian guests, and wish you a pleasant journey and good health during your sightseeing tours in various parts of our country.

I propose:

To the health of Dr. Hatta and his wife, and all the distinguished Indonesian guests,

To the health of Ambassador Wijopranoto and his wife, the host of today's banquet,

To the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people,

To lasting world peace,

To the health of President Sukarno!

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的穆罕默德·哈达博士阁下，大使阁下，女士们，先生们：
    在哈达博士即将离开北京前往我国其他各地参观访问的前夕，我愿代表中国政府和中国人民对哈达博士的访问，再一次表示衷心的感谢。
    哈达博士，你这次来我国访问，对中国和印度尼西亚两国人民友好关系的发展具有重要的意义。虽然我们这次相聚的日子很短，但是，你对中国人民的深厚友情和对中国建设事业的深切关怀已经给中国人民留下了深刻的印象。你到中国后所作的几次维护世界和平和加强中国和印度尼西亚友好合作的演说，更增加了中国人民对你的钦佩。我们和阁下具有同样的信念，那就是意识形态和政治制度的不同的国家可以和平共处。我们也赞成你所提出的由苏联和美国达成二十五年和平协议的建议。中国人民愿意同印度尼西亚人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，为贯彻和发展和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的决议而努力。
    哈达博士，你和其他各位印度尼西亚贵宾们这次来中国进行友好访问，正是中国人民为超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗的时候，你们看到了中国人民为克服历史遗留下来的经济和文化的落后状况需要进行多么艰巨的工作。印度尼西亚人民也正沿着发展独立的民族经济的道路前进。为了实现这个目标，印度尼西亚政府已经订出了一个五年建设计划。我们诚恳地希望，两国人民在建设事业中的互相学习和互相帮助将获得进一步的加强。
    你们在中国不论到甚么地方都会感受到中国人民对具有光荣的民族革命传统的印度尼西亚人民的真挚感情和崇高敬意。中国人民一向同情印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义压迫、维护祖国主权和领土完整的英勇斗争。我们坚决支持你们收复西伊里安的正义斗争，并且相信你们必将取得完全的胜利。
    哈达博士，在你即将离开北京的时候，我谨向你和全体印度尼西亚贵宾们表示深切的惜别之意，并且祝你们在我国各地参观游览中，旅程愉快，身体健康。
    我提议：
    为哈达博士阁下和他的夫人以及全体印度尼西亚贵宾们的健康，
    为今天宴会的主人维约普拉诺托大使阁下和他的夫人的健康，
    为中国和印度尼西亚两国人民永恒的友谊，
    为世界持久和平，
    为苏加诺总统阁下的健康干杯！
