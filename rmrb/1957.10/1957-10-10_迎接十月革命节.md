Czechoslovakia Communist Party Publishes Propaganda Outline

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th: "Red Right News" published on the 8th an outline entitled "The Significance of the Great October Socialist Revolution to the Czechoslovak People" released by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Institute of History of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

The outline emphasizes that the freedom of the Czechoslovak Republic and its people, as well as the victory of the working class in leading the country towards socialism, are inextricably linked to the October Revolution.

The outline describes the influence of the Russian October Revolution, Lenin's doctrine, and the class struggle in the Soviet Union from 1918 to 1920 on the Czechoslovak working class, as well as the achievements of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in learning Leninism and the experience of the Soviet Communist Party after its establishment, and in overcoming dissident forces. The outline emphasizes that the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet army was a decisive turning point in Czechoslovak history and the beginning of the socialist era.

The outline states that the alliance with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries has become a solid guarantee for the independence of our nation and country.

Of inestimable significance to the Czechoslovak people is also the fact that they can rely on the reliable guidance of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, enriched by the Soviet Union with the rich experience of socialist construction. The Soviet Communist Party's consistent struggle to achieve ideological and political unity in the ranks of the party, and its efforts to creatively develop Marxism-Leninism, are examples and models for the revolutionary parties of the working class in all countries. The historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party proved the role of the Soviet Union and its glorious Communist Party as the leading force in the world socialist camp.

The outline concludes by saying that the invincible working class of the socialist camp countries, led by the Soviet Union, is fighting to safeguard peace by striving for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and for active economic and cultural cooperation, and by implementing a policy of peaceful competition. We are proud that our socialist motherland is firmly advancing on this front.

Czechoslovakia is also preparing to hold a nationwide peace and friendship relay race to commemorate this great festival.

    迎接十月革命节
    捷共发表宣传提纲
    新华社布拉格9日电　“红色权利报”8日发表了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会宣传鼓动部和捷共历史研究所公布的题为“伟大的十月社会主义革命对捷克斯洛伐克人民的意义”的提纲。
    提纲着重指出，捷克斯洛伐克共和国和人民的自由，以及领导国家走向社会主义的工人阶级的胜利，是同十月革命牢不可破地联系在一起的。
    提纲叙述了俄国十月革命、列宁的学说和苏联1918年到1920年的阶级斗争对捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级的影响，以及捷共成立后学习列宁主义和苏联共产党的经验，战胜异己势力的成就。提纲着重指出，苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克是捷克斯洛伐克历史上决定性的转折点，是社会主义时代的开端。
    提纲说，同苏联和社会主义阵营各国的联盟成了我们民族和国家独立的牢固保证。
    对捷克斯洛伐克人民具有无可估价的意义的还有这一事实：他们可以依靠被苏联用社会主义建设的丰富经验充实起来的马克思列宁主义学说的可靠指导。苏联共产党为争取党的队伍在思想上和政治上的团结一致所进行的始终一贯的斗争，它为创造性地发展马克思列宁主义所作的努力，对各国工人阶级的革命政党是一个范例和榜样。苏共第二十次代表大会的历史性决议证明了苏联及其光荣的共产党作为世界社会主义阵营的领导力量的作用。
    提纲最后说，由于努力争取社会制度不同国家的和平共处和争取积极的经济、文化合作，由于执行和平竞赛的政策，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的战无不胜的工人阶级正在为维护和平而斗争。我们为自己的社会主义祖国正坚定地在这条战线上前进而感到骄傲。
    捷克斯洛伐克还准备举行旅行全国的和平友谊接力赛跑，来纪念这一伟大节日。
