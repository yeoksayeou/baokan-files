Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th: Members of the Lezhu Agricultural Cooperative in Shunde County, Guangdong Province, launched a major debate on the question of whether or not to take the path of collectivization. After winning the debate against some well-to-do middle peasants' arguments against collectivization, He You, He Zhi, He Jing, and other six upper-middle peasants, known as the "pillars of the wavering faction," were still not convinced. They proposed the idea of "three contracts to the household" and promoted the "five major benefits" of "three contracts to the household" everywhere: first, freedom of attendance, convenient morning and evening, and children can also help with farm work; second, household fertilizer is at one's own disposal, applying it wherever one likes, and one can also engage in sideline occupations at will; third, self-arranged attendance can be compact and not waste work points; fourth, the increased production can all belong to oneself; fifth, it saves the trouble of the team leader arranging work. At first, thirty or so poor and lower-middle peasant households in the third village were also confused by these "benefits," saying that this was also a viable option. Individual cadres also felt that this could lighten their burden.

When everyone asked how to "contract three things to the household," these upper-middle peasant households explained the specific methods: each household contracts for labor, production, and costs, and the land is allocated to households by drawing lots; oxen are used in rotation, and farm tools are distributed to each household; production is set at a fixed quota, and the excess belongs to oneself; each family dries their grain in front of their own house. At this time, everyone felt that something was wrong and immediately started discussing it. Poor peasant Guo Xin asked: "Whoever uses the oxen first will take a big advantage. If the land is plowed and dried early, catching up with the farming season, one mu of land can produce fifty more jin. Is it better for you to use it first or for me to use it first?" Poor peasant He Zhi also said: "There are more than three hundred households in the whole cooperative, but only one hundred boats. How can they be divided? Moreover, if we work independently, who will take care of the reduced production?" Then everyone asked: "The land is far and near, fertile and barren. Who can divide it evenly? If it is divided according to labor, those with more labor will take advantage, and if it is divided according to population, those with fewer children will suffer." At this time, upper-middle peasants He You and He Zhi retorted: "Wouldn't it be fine for each household to take back its original land! If farm tools cannot be divided, then bid for them, and whoever bids the highest will get them. In the future, the good or bad of production and life will be each person for himself!" Upper-middle peasants Liang Tong and Feng Weigen said even more bluntly: "You say this won't work and that won't work. In the past, when we worked individually, didn't we also manage ourselves!"

As soon as they said this, everyone understood clearly, and the poor peasants said one after another: "No, this is individual farming, taking the old path." "If that's the case, why did we organize cooperatives in the first place!" "If contracting to the household is so good, why were sugarcane and rice yields several percentage points lower in the past when we worked individually than they are today?" Everyone also listed many disadvantages of this proposal: "It will teach us to fight each other, causing bloodshed"; "There will be no leadership in production"; "The wealthy households can concentrate on engaging in spontaneous development"; "The contiguous sugarcane fields and fish ponds will have to be dismantled again"; "The output will definitely return to what it was during individual farming"... Poor peasant Chen Licai said: "If this happens, won't it be the poor who cultivate barren land, and the barren land that cultivates the poor?"

After the debate, out of the more than three hundred households in the entire cooperative, only fourteen upper-middle peasants, starting with the initiators He You and others, persisted in this proposal. Their relationships were almost all fathers and sons, brothers, or uncles and nephews. The rest of the people, including the upper-middle peasants, expressed their opposition.

Later, these few upper-middle peasants also proposed that the cooperative lease land to the members for cultivation, but no one agreed with them anymore. Everyone said: "Isn't it the same old trick?" At this point, several upper-middle peasant households proposed withdrawing from the cooperative. The members believed that if they insisted on withdrawing, they should be allowed to, but everyone also demanded that a meeting be convened immediately to discuss ways to restrict the "spontaneous" individual households and those members who were not actively attending work.

### 实行“包产到户”就是变相单干  勒竹社社员坚决不走回头路

    实行“包产到户”就是变相单干
    勒竹社社员坚决不走回头路
    本报特约新华社广州13日电  广东省顺德县勒竹农业社社员，在要不要走合作化道路的问题上展开大论战，辩赢一些富裕中农反对合作化的论点以后，被称为“动摇派台柱”的何有、何枝、何镜等六个上中农还不心服，他们又提出了“三包到户”的主张，并且到处宣传“三包到户”有五大好处：一是出勤自由，早晚听便，小孩也可帮忙干田里的活；二是家肥归自己支配，爱在那里施就在那里施，又可以随意搞副业；三是自己安排出勤能紧凑，不浪费工分；四是增产部分可以全归自己；五是省掉队长排工的麻烦。初时，第三分村有三十来户贫农和下中农也被这几个“好处”迷惑，说这样做也未尝不可。个别干部也认为这样可以减轻自己的担子。
    当大家追问怎样“三包到户”时，这些上中农户便说出了具体办法：由各户包工、包产、包成本，土地抽签归户使用；耕牛轮流使，农具分给各户；产量订出定额，超额的归自己；各家门前自晒谷。这时大家便感到不对头，马上议论纷纷。贫农郭信问：“谁先占用耕牛谁就占大便宜，土地翻晒早，赶上农时，一亩地就可增产五十斤。究竟是你先用好还是我先用好？”贫农何执也说：“全社三百多户，只有一百只艇，怎能分？再说独自干活，减产了谁来照顾？”接着大家又问：“土地有远近，有肥瘦，谁能分得均匀？如果按劳动力分，劳力多的占了便宜，如果按人口分，小孩少的又吃亏。”这时上中农何有和何枝又反辩说：“各户领回自己原来的土地不就行了吗！农具若分不开，就投标，谁出高价就归谁。以后生产生活好坏，各顾各就是了。”上中农梁同和冯为根更干脆说：“你们说这样行不通那样行不通，过去单干不也是自己管自己！”
    这么一说，大家可清楚了，贫农们纷纷说：“不行啊！这样就是搞单干，走回头路。”“果若如此，当初何必组织合作社！”“果若包到户好，当时单干为什么甘蔗和稻谷产量比今日少几成？”大家还列举了这个主张的许多坏处：“教咱们相争，头破血流”；“生产无人领导”；“富裕户可以专心搞自发”；“连片的甘蔗地和鱼塘又要拆开了”；“产量一定会退回单干时的样子”……。贫农陈礼才说：“这么一来还不是穷人耕瘦地，瘦地耕穷人。”
    经过辩论，全社三百多户，到最后坚持这个主张的人，从倡议人何有等算起，也不过是十四个上中农。他们的关系，几乎不是父子、兄弟，就是叔伯。其余的人，包括上中农，都表示反对。
    以后，这少数的上中农又曾经提出由合作社出租土地给社员耕种的主张，然而再没有人附和了，大家都说：“还不是老花样。”至此，几户上中农便提出退社。社员们认为如果他们一定要退就让退，但是大家也要求马上集议想法限制搞“自发”的单干户和那些不积极出勤的社员。
