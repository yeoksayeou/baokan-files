Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to reports, people from all walks of life in Arab countries have condemned the provocative acts of U.S. imperialism in the Middle East and expressed their support for the struggle of the Syrian people.

    Damascus dispatch: A 24-member delegation from the Lebanese National Front visited Syrian President Kuwatly and Prime Minister al-Assali on the 24th, conveying the Lebanese people's support for Syria's current struggle against U.S. and Turkish provocations.

    The delegation's spokesman, former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, told al-Assali, "We have come to Damascus to express the genuine wishes of the Lebanese people. Lebanon is prepared to sacrifice everything it has to defend Syria's independence."

    Delegate and former Speaker of Parliament, Ahmed al-Assad, said, "The Lebanese view the situation in Syria from the same perspective as the Syrians, and they believe that any aggression against Syria is an aggression against their own country."
