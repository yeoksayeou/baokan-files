　　"...As mentioned above, of the more than one thousand big-character posters, the vast majority put forward very good opinions!" The Party Secretary stood on the platform, in front of the microphone, and spoke in a loud voice about the first stage of the rectification campaign, saying, "We sincerely welcome and accept these opinions and correct our shortcomings and mistakes. Big-character posters are a top-quality gift from the worker comrades to us!"
　　Ah, gifts! What an appropriate metaphor! I remember a few years ago, Factory Director Old Hero (a labor hero of worker origin, everyone in the factory called him "Old Hero") also said something similar. At that time, when he was first transferred to our factory, at the welcoming meeting, he waved his big hand excitedly and said, "...The factory directors and foremen of the old society wanted you to give 'straw bags'; I, this factory director, don't want you to give straw bags. However, I want the comrades to each give a few rationalization proposals!"
　　Speaking of gifts, it reminds me of something that the father of Chief Shift Officer Li Zhenqi (a retired old worker) told me:
　　Seventeen or eighteen years ago, during the period of enemy and puppet rule, Master Li was a stoker for the low-pressure furnace in the power plant. One day, near the end of the year, the factory director, surnamed Yu, strolled to the boiler room, glanced at Master Li, and said coldly, "Don't come to work tomorrow, the factory is laying people off." Then he left. Master Li felt as if he had been struck by lightning, and he felt extremely uncomfortable. Originally, the money he earned was barely enough to support his family, just enough to eat bean-cake noodles. This time, it was unimaginable! After work, he walked on the road home, his head hanging low, his spirit lost. A phantom floated into his mind: his old mother, his weak wife, his children as thin as fiddles... all silently, with pleading eyes, looked at him, only him...
　　"Old Li, off work?" The odd-job worker Old Liu shouted behind him. When Old Li turned his head, Old Liu said in surprise, "What's wrong? Master Li, your complexion is not good!"
　　Master Li told Old Liu about the unfortunate event; Old Liu was both angry and sympathetic. He saw clearly and said to Master Li, "That guy is giving you a hint, he wants to eat you out!"
　　In the evening, Zhenqi, a twelve or thirteen-year-old child, saw his father borrow several silver dollars from his neighbors, buy a pair of fat, heavy trotters from the pork shop; and take the family's live rooster from the nest and tie its legs. A little smile appeared on Zhenqi's yellow and thin face. How long had it been since he tasted any meat! The child asked with joy: "Dad, what are you buying meat for? And the chicken?"
　　"The meat is for someone else; the chicken, we'll sell it tomorrow." Dad said this, not daring to look at his beloved only son. In his heart, he felt extremely pained. The child was very obedient, and didn't ask for any to eat. When the child fell asleep, Master Li carried the straw bag with the trotters, and the live rooster, and went to Factory Director Yu's house. The factory director was not at home, and his wife greeted him, pretending to be kind and said: "Hey, what are you sending this for? We have it."
　　"Give it to the factory director to eat!" Master Li said with a miserable smile, "We have it at home too!" The wife then accepted the gift and placed it in the display cabinet. There were already unopened boxes of pastries, tea bags, and bottles of liquor...
　　The next day, Master Li met the odd-job worker Old Liu on his way to work. Master Li told Old Liu about the situation; Old Liu said, "Then it's okay, go to work."
　　More than ten years have passed, and Master Li has retired. He lives in a beautiful red model worker building. His son Zhenqi, who used to be as thin as a fiddle, is now tall and handsome; he is the chief shift officer of the power plant and the former secretary of the Youth League General Branch Committee. They still raise roosters at home, letting them crow; and buy trotters for the whole family to feast on.
　　Gifts are no longer needed. If they are given again, they will be rationalization proposals for socialist construction written on paper or presented at meetings...

    “……如上所说，一千多张大字报，除了极个别的以外，绝大部分的意见提得很好！”党委书记站在讲台上，麦克风前，用响亮的声音讲着整风第一阶段的情况，说：“我们衷心地欢迎和接受这些意见，改正缺点和错误。大字报，是职工同志们送给我们的上等礼物！”
    啊，礼物！多么恰当的比喻！记得几年前，厂长老英雄（一位工人出身的劳动英雄，厂里都管他叫“老英雄”）也说过同样意思的话。那时，他初调我厂，在欢迎他的大会上，他兴奋地挥动着大手，说道：“……旧社会的厂长和把头们要你们送‘蒲包’；我这个厂长，不要你们送蒲包了。可是，要同志们每人送几条合理化建议！”
    提起礼物，倒叫我想起总值长李振奇同志的父亲（一位退休的老工友）告诉我的一件事：
    十七、八年以前，敌伪统治时代，李师傅在发电厂担任低压炉的司火工。快过年的一天，姓于的厂长蹓跶到锅炉房，看了李师傅一眼，冷冷地说：“明天你别来上班啦，厂子里裁人呢。”说完就走。李师傅像叫电击了一下似的，心身都万分难受。本来，挣的钱勉强养家糊口，刚够吃豆饼面的。这一下，不堪设想啊！下班以后，他走在回家的路上，搭拉着脑袋，丧魂失魄。脑子里浮上一个幻影：老母、弱妻、干瘦得像一把胡琴似的孩子……都默默无言，睁着祈求的眼睛，向他一个人望着、望着……
    “老李，下班了吗？”杂务工老刘在他后面喊了一声。当老李回一下头的时候，老刘惊奇地说：“怎么啦？李师傅，你的面色不大好啊！”
    李师傅把不幸的事件告诉给老刘；老刘又是气愤又是同情，他看得明白，对李师傅说：“那家伙是给你个信儿，想吃你一嘴啦！”
    傍晚，十二、三岁的孩子振奇，看见父亲从东邻西舍借来几块大洋，到猪肉铺里买来一对肥重的肘子；又把自家的活公鸡从窝里掏出来，捆绑两腿。振奇的黄瘦的脸上显出一点笑容。多少多少时候没尝到一点肉味了！孩子怀着喜悦的心情问道：“爸爸，买肉干什么？还有鸡？”
    “肉是帮人家买的；鸡，明儿去卖。”爸爸说着这，不敢望自己心爱的独生子一眼。心里，惨痛极了。孩子很听话，没有要一点吃。李师傅当孩子睡下的时候，就提着包装肘子的蒲包，还有大活公鸡，走向于厂长家去。厂长不在家，太太迎出来，假情假意地说：“嗨，送这个来干什么？我们有。”
    “送给厂长吃吧！”李师傅惨笑着说：“我们家里也有！”太太便接受了礼物，放在立橱里。那里正摆着还未启封的点心盒、茶叶包、烧酒瓶子……
    第二天，李师傅在上班的路上又碰见杂工老刘，李师傅把情况告诉给老刘；老刘说：“这就没事儿了，上班去吧。”
    十几年，过去了，李师傅已经退休。住在红色的漂亮的劳模大楼里面。儿子振奇，从前干瘦得像一把胡琴，现在长的身材高大、模样英俊；担任发电厂的总值长，青年团总支委员会的前任书记。他们家还养着公鸡，让它打鸣儿；买了肘子，全家会餐。
    礼物，不用送了。如果再送，那就是写在纸上的或者提在会议上的，为着社会主义建设的合理化建议……。
