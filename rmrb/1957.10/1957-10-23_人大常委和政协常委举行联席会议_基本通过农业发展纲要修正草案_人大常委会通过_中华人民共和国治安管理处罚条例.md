Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. The 81st meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the 47th meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference were held jointly on the afternoon of the 22nd.

After discussion, the meeting basically approved the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) for 1956 to 1967.

Prior to this meeting, the joint meeting had divided into four groups to discuss the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. Everyone believed that the revised draft program was fully adapted to the changing national conditions, its content was very comprehensive, detailed and thorough, pointing out the goals and prospects for China's agricultural development in the next twelve years, and would play a huge role in promoting the development of agriculture throughout the country. During the group discussions, everyone put forward many suggestions for revising the draft program, which will be submitted to farmers and all the people for discussion after being considered and revised by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

At the 81st meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, after hearing the explanation by Minister of Public Security Luo Ruiqing, the "Regulations on Penalties for Public Security Administration of the People's Republic of China" were discussed and approved. The problem to be dealt with by these regulations belongs to minor illegal acts that violate public security administration. These minor illegal acts are not serious enough to violate the criminal law and do not warrant criminal punishment; however, they exceed the limits that general criticism and education can solve, and require the enforcement of certain administrative penalties. The scope of punishment is roughly divided into four categories: the first category is disrupting public order; the second category is endangering public safety; the third category is infringing on citizens' personal rights; and the fourth category is damaging public and private property. Punishments are divided into three types: warning, fines, and detention.

The Standing Committee meeting of the National People's Congress also approved the appointment of Lian Guan as Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and approved the Supreme People's Procuratorate's request to appoint Li Zhen as Deputy Procurator of the Military Procuratorate of the Supreme People's Procuratorate. The meeting also approved other appointment and removal lists.

    人大常委和政协常委举行联席会议
    基本通过农业发展纲要修正草案
    人大常委会通过“中华人民共和国治安管理处罚条例”
    新华社22日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十一次会议和人民政协全国委员会常务委员会第四十七次会议在22日下午举行联席会议。
    会议经过讨论，基本通过了1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）。
    在这次会议以前，联席会议曾分四个小组对修改后的全国农业发展纲要草案进行了讨论。大家认为修改后的纲要草案是完全适应国家情况变化的，它的内容非常全面、详尽、周到，指出了我国今后十二年农业发展的目标和远景，对全国农业的发展将会起巨大的推进作用。在小组讨论中，大家对修改的纲要草案提出了许多修正意见，将经中共中央考虑修改后，提交农民和全体人民展开讨论。
    在全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十一次会议上，听取了公安部部长罗瑞卿的说明，讨论通过了“中华人民共和国治安管理处罚条例”。这个条例所要对待的问题，是属于违反治安管理的轻微的违法行为。这种轻微的违法行为，还不到触犯刑法的程度，够不上给予刑事处分；但又超过了一般批评教育所能解决的限度，需要执行一定的行政处罚。处罚的范围大致分为四类：第一类是扰乱公共秩序的；第二类是妨害公共安全的；第三类是侵犯公民人身权利的；第四类是损害公、私财产的。处罚分警告、罚款、拘留三种。
    这次全国人民代表大会常务委员会会议还通过任命连贯为全国人民代表大会常务委员会副秘书长，批准了最高人民检察院提请任命李贞为最高人民检察院军事检察院副检察长。会议还通过了其他的任免名单。
