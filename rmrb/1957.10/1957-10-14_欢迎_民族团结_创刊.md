　　Welcoming the Inauguration of "National Unity"
　　Zhen Zong
    The "National Unity" publication by the Nationalities Publishing House has been launched. Without a doubt, this publication will further promote unity among all ethnic groups in our country.

    When I was very young, I knew that there were Miao people in our county. Almost all the residents in the county town were Han Chinese, but Miao people could often be seen on the streets. They came to town to sell and buy things. The townspeople relied mainly on them for firewood and vegetables. For a period, my house was right next to the vegetable market, and there were quite a few Miao people setting up vegetable stalls nearby. I still remember a Miao girl who sold tofu. She had the robustness typical of Miao people, with a round face and bright eyes. She was very amiable and cheerful, chatting and laughing with those around her.

    The Miao and Han people were very close in life, and there were many relationships of relatives and friends.

    Now I know that in my hometown, there are not only Miao people, but also Tujia people. I never imagined that for so long before liberation, a nation of 300,000 people was completely buried by reactionary rule. Now the Communist Party is helping this nation to stand up and leading it onto the path of ethnic equality and happiness.

    From this, I can't help but think that a Han person who lived in the old society inevitably has these kinds of situations in terms of ethnic relations: one is not knowing how to treat fraternal ethnic groups with an equal spirit, and the other is not understanding the situation of fraternal ethnic groups. This is the result of past ethnic oppression and ethnic separation.

    After liberation, under the leadership and education of the Communist Party, this situation has undergone fundamental changes. Taking my hometown as an example, the Miao, Tujia, and Han people are very united. Everyone is close and enthusiastically developing production and engaging in various constructions. I heard a housewife from my hometown always naturally refer to the Miao people as "brotherly ethnic groups" whenever she mentioned them. Don't think this is a small thing. The change in her appellation is enough to show how profound and broad the changes in ethnic relations have been.

    However, it cannot be said that the influence of the old society has been completely eliminated. In the cause of building a socialist motherland, we need to continuously strengthen the close unity of all ethnic groups in our country. If there is a lack of a spirit of ethnic equality, it is most harmful to ethnic unity; if we do not understand the ethnic situation, it is easy to neglect fraternal ethnic groups, which is obviously also detrimental to ethnic unity.

    There should be no exception for anyone to accept the education of the Party's ethnic policy. I don't think there is anyone who can say that he does not need to know the Party's ethnic policy and the situation of various ethnic groups. On the surface, it seems that people who live and work in the interior, in areas where the Han people are concentrated, are unlikely to come into contact with ethnic issues, but this is not necessarily the case. According to surveys, more than 90% of the counties in the country have ethnic minorities living together or scattered, and the Hui ethnic group alone is scattered in more than two-thirds of the counties in the country. In this case, how can you not encounter a member of an ethnic minority? The ethnic relations in our country are developing rapidly, and the exchanges between ethnic groups are becoming more and more frequent and extensive. We are encountering ethnic relations and ethnic issues more and more often. Furthermore, our great motherland has so many brotherly ethnic groups. Under the leadership of the Party and the guidance of ethnic policies, all ethnic groups are closely united and working together to build a strong socialist motherland. How can we be content with ignorance of such a significant matter?

    Therefore, we warmly welcome the inauguration of the "National Unity" magazine. Because the "National Unity" magazine is launched precisely to undertake the tasks of publicizing the Party's ethnic policies and the Marxist-Leninist theory of ethnic issues, reflecting the development and changes in ethnic minority areas, and introducing the history and culture of ethnic minorities. In "National Unity", we will be able to see and experience more frequently and more centrally how the Party is correctly and successfully solving the ethnic issues of our country. When we see all the ethnic groups united in the motherland's big family, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are rapidly developing and gradually moving towards prosperity, naturally, we will love our Party more, love our motherland more, love our brotherly ethnic groups more, and love our socialist cause more.

    Some right-wing elements are still attacking the Party and the people of all ethnic groups on ethnic issues. These right-wing elements exist in both the Han and minority ethnic groups. Their common point is to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and undermine ethnic unity. In fact, this is to alienate the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the people of all ethnic groups, destroy the happy life that all ethnic groups have already obtained, and try to pull all ethnic groups away from the socialist road and back to the dark days before liberation. The inauguration of "National Unity" will prove with facts as clear as the sun and the moon that only the proletariat and the Communist Party can solve this complex ethnic issue in Chinese history, and give the right-wing elements a powerful blow.

    We believe that "National Unity" will surely be warmly welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups and become one of the publications that everyone loves to read.

### 欢迎“民族团结”创刊

　　欢迎“民族团结”创刊
　　振宗
    民族出版社出版的“民族团结”已经创刊了。毫无疑问，这个刊物将更进一步促进我国各民族间的团结。
    我很小的时候，就知道在我们县里有苗人。县城里住的差不多全是汉人，但是在街上却可以常常看到苗人，他们是进城来卖东西和买东西的。城里人需用的柴和蔬菜，主要靠他们供给。有一个时期，我家的门前就是菜市，在附近摆菜担的苗人很不少。至今我还记得一位卖豆腐的苗家姑娘，她具有苗人通常有的健壮，圆圆的脸，明朗的眼睛，是个很和气、很愉快的人，同周围的人有说有笑。
    苗汉人民在生活上是很密切的，亲戚朋友的关系也不少。
    现在我才知道，在我的家乡，不仅有苗族，还有土家族。真没有想到，在解放前那么长的日子里，一个拥有三十万人口的民族竟被反动统治整个的埋没了。现在共产党扶助这个民族站立起来了，并且领着它走上了民族平等和幸福的大道。
    从这里我不由地想到，一个在旧社会里生活过来的汉人，在民族关系上难免有这种情况，一是不懂得以平等的精神对待兄弟民族，一是不了解兄弟民族的情况，这是过去民族压迫和民族隔阂造成的结果。
    解放后，在共产党的领导和教育下，这种情况已经有了根本的改变，拿我们家乡来说，苗族、土家族和汉族就团结得很好，大家亲亲热热，正在兴高采烈地发展生产，从事各种建设。我听到一个从故乡来的家庭妇女每当说到苗族的时候，总是很自然地称为“兄弟民族”，不要以为这是一件小事情，在她的口中一个称谓的改变，足以看出民族关系发生了怎样深而且广的变化。
    但是，还不能说旧社会的影响已经消除净尽了。在建设社会主义祖国的事业中，我们需要不断加强我国各民族的亲密团结，而如果缺乏民族平等精神，则最有害于民族团结；如果不了解民族情况，就很容易忽视兄弟民族，这显然也是不利于民族团结的。
    需要接受党的民族政策的教育，对于任何人来说，应当是没有例外的。我想没有那一个人能说他不需要知道党的民族政策和各民族的情况。粗看起来，好像在内地，在汉族的聚居区生活和工作的人，不至于接触民族问题，实际上不见得如此。据调查，全国有90％以上的县份有杂居和散居的少数民族，仅仅回族就散居在全国三分之二以上的县份中。如此看来，你能不遇着一个少数民族成员么？我国民族关系在迅速发展，各民族之间的交往愈来愈频繁和广泛了，我们接触到民族关系和民族问题的时候也愈来愈多了。再说，我们伟大的祖国有这么多兄弟民族，在党的领导和民族政策指导下，各民族亲密团结，为建设社会主义的强大祖国而共同努力，对于具有这样重大意义的事情，我们怎能甘于无知无识呢？
    因此，我们热烈欢迎“民族团结”杂志的创刊。因为“民族团结”杂志正是负着宣传党的民族政策和马克思列宁主义的民族问题理论，反映少数民族地区的发展变化，介绍少数民族的历史文化等任务而创刊的。在“民族团结”上，我们将可以更经常地和比较集中地看到和体会到党是怎样正确地和成功地在解决我国的民族问题。当我们看到团结在祖国大家庭里的各民族，在中国共产党的领导下，都在迅速发展和逐步走向繁荣的时候，很自然，我们会更爱我们的党，更爱我们的祖国，更爱我们的各兄弟民族，更爱我们的社会主义事业。
    有些右派分子还在民族问题上向党、向各民族人民进攻。这种右派分子在汉族中有，在少数民族中也有，他们的共同点是反对党、反对社会主义，破坏民族团结。这实际上就是在离间党与各民族人民的血肉关系，破坏各民族已经得到的幸福生活，想把各民族拉开社会主义的道路，回到解放以前那种暗无天日的日子里去。“民族团结”的创刊，将以昭若日月的事实证明，只有无产阶级、共产党才能解决我国历史上这个复杂的民族问题，而给右派分子以有力的痛击。
    我们相信：“民族团结”必然会受到各族人民的热烈欢迎，成为大家爱读的刊物之一。
