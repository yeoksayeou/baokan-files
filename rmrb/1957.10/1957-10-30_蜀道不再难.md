    The Shu Road is No Longer Difficult

    (Our Dispatch) Since liberation, Sichuan Province's water and land transportation has greatly improved. In recent years, more than 1,100 kilometers of railways have been newly built, nearly 10,000 kilometers of highways have been newly built and restored, more than 25,000 kilometers of avenues and post roads have been newly built and renovated, more than 3,000 kilometers of shipping lanes for ships and wooden boats have been opened, and a total of more than 370,000 kilometers of shipping lanes have been renovated and dredged. More than 1,600 kilometers of air routes have been restored and opened. Of the province's 195 counties, more than 20 have access to trains, nearly 100 have access to ships and wooden boats, and more than 160 have access to automobiles. In the Liangshan, Aba, and Ganzi minority areas, which relied entirely on yak transportation before liberation, there are now more than 1,600 kilometers of highways. Sixty-eight county towns, including Zhaojue and Yajiang, which had never seen a car before, now have cars coming and going.

    "The Shu Road is difficult," has begun to become a historical term. (Rao Xuecheng)

    蜀道不再难
    本报讯　解放以来，四川省水陆交通有了很大的改善。几年来，新修了铁路一千一百多公里，新修和恢复公路近万公里，新修和改建大道和驿道两万五千多公里，开辟轮船木船航道三千多公里，整修、疏浚航道共三十七万多公里，恢复开辟航空里程一千六百多公里。全省一百九十五个县，有二十多县通火车，有近百个县通轮船木船，有一百六十多个县通汽车。解放前全靠牦牛运输的凉山、阿坝、甘孜等少数民族地区，现在有了公路一千六百多公里。过去汽车影子都没有见过的昭觉、雅江等六十八个县城，现在也有汽车来往。
      “蜀道难”，已经开始成为历史名词了。　　　　（饶学成）
