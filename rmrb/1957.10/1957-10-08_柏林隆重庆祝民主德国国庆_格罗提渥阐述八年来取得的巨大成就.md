Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 6th: According to TASS, Berlin held a grand celebration on October 6th to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic on October 7th. The celebration was attended by Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl, Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, other party and government leaders, representatives of various democratic parties and mass organizations, prominent figures, representatives of the working masses, and foreign envoys.

Grotewohl spoke at the meeting, recounting the great achievements made by the working people of the German Democratic Republic in various aspects of economic, political, and cultural life since the founding of the republic. When talking about the republic's economic development in 1957, he said that in the first half of this year, the labor productivity of industrial enterprises in the German Democratic Republic increased by 5% compared with the same period last year, and the total industrial output increased by 8%. In this year alone, the republic newly established 184 agricultural production cooperatives. At the same time, the German Democratic Republic also expanded its trade with socialist countries and with India, Egypt, Syria, and Sudan.

Grotewohl then talked about the main issues in the German Democratic Republic's foreign policy. He pointed out that the international prestige of the German Democratic Republic is constantly growing, and it has established diplomatic relations with many countries with a population of 913 million. He said that the visit of our party and government delegation to Moscow in January this year and the return visit of our Soviet friends in August particularly strengthened our friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Our friendship with all people's democratic countries is more consolidated. Our relations with anti-imperialist countries, especially with Egypt, India, and Syria, are developing well.

Grotewohl welcomed the proposals made by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko at the United Nations General Assembly on stopping nuclear tests for two or three years, banning the use of atomic weapons for at least five years, and peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world. He said that these proposals are proactive actions that help to ease international tensions.

Grotewohl also welcomed the statements made by the Polish and Czechoslovak governments on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. They stated that if the two Germanies agreed to prohibit the manufacture and storage of nuclear weapons on their territories, the Polish and Czechoslovak governments agreed not to produce and store similar weapons on their territories. Grotewohl also mentioned the recent results of the West German Federal Assembly elections. He said that we are not surprised by the results of this election. We have never believed that elections conducted in a capitalist manner can fundamentally change the balance of power. To achieve this, the people must truly express their will. He said that the Social Democratic Party cannot win because it has not thoroughly opposed the militarist policies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, nor has it thoroughly opposed compulsory military service.

Grotewohl finally called on representatives of all patriotic forces in East and West Germany to cooperate, called on the German working class to act in unity, and called for strengthening the German Democratic Republic.

    柏林隆重庆祝民主德国国庆
    格罗提渥阐述八年来取得的巨大成就
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社柏林6日讯：10月6日在柏林举行庆祝大会，庆祝10月7日德意志民主共和国成立八周年。出席庆祝大会的有德意志民主共和国人民议院主席狄克曼、格罗提渥总理、德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希以及党和政府的其他领导人、各民主党派和群众组织的代表、社会名流和劳动群众的代表以及外国使节等。
    格罗提渥在大会上讲话，叙述了德意志民主共和国劳动人民自从共和国成立以来在经济、政治和文化生活各个方面取得的巨大成就。他在谈到共和国1957年的经济发展情况时说，今年上半年德意志民主共和国工业企业的劳动生产率比去年同一时期提高了5％，工业总产量增加了8％。在今年一年内共和国就新成立了一百八十四个农业生产合作社。同时，德意志民主共和国同社会主义阵营国家以及同印度、埃及、叙利亚和苏丹的贸易也扩大了。
    格罗提渥接着谈到德意志民主共和国外交政策中的主要问题。他指出，德意志民主共和国的国际威信不断增长，它已经同拥有九亿一千三百万居民的许多国家建立了外交关系。他说，我国党和政府代表团今年1月访问莫斯科和我们的苏联朋友8月的回访特别加强了我们同苏联的友好关系。我们同所有人民民主国家的友谊更加巩固了。我们同反帝国主义国家的关系，特别是同埃及、印度、叙利亚的关系良好地发展着。
    格罗提渥欢迎苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在联合国大会上提出的关于停止核试验两、三年、起码禁止使用原子武器五年、世界各国和平共处的建议。他说，这些建议是有助于和缓国际紧张局势的主动行动。
    格罗提渥也欢迎波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国政府关于禁止核武器的声明。它们声明，如果两个德国同意在本国领土上禁止制造和存放核武器的话，波捷两国政府同意不在本国领土上生产和存放同类武器。格罗提渥还提到不久前西德联邦议院选举结果。他说，我们并不对这次选举结果感到奇怪。我们从来就不认为，按照资本主义方式进行选举能够从根本上改变力量对比。要做到这点，必须真正地让人民表达自己的意志。他说，社会民主党不能获胜，因为它没有彻底反对北大西洋集团的军国主义政策，也没有彻底反对义务兵役制。
    格罗提渥最后号召东西德一切爱国力量的代表人物进行合作，号召德国工人阶级一致行动，号召加强德意志民主共和国。
