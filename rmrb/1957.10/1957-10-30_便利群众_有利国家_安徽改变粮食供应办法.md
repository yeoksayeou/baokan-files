Facilitating the People, Benefiting the Nation
Anhui Changes Grain Supply Methods

(Our dispatch from Hefei, October 29th) In the process of rectifying and improving, the grain departments in Anhui Province have reformed some of the methods for implementing the unified purchase and sale of grain. These reforms are of great benefit to both the people and the country.

In the past, Anhui Province stipulated that for some disaster-stricken rice-producing areas, the annual calculation period for rural grain retention was from May of the current year to June of the following year. After the wheat harvest, the masses used wheat to replace rice. However, because the masses in rice-producing areas did not grow much wheat, they could not replace the autumn rice, and the state had to supply grain again. After the autumn rice harvest, because the grain supplied after the wheat harvest had to be deducted, the autumn grain retention often could not meet the needs until the next year's wheat harvest. This resulted in the masses "eating tomorrow's food today," and the state had to increase the amount of grain purchased and sold, which wasted grain and inconvenienced both the masses and the country. Recently, the grain departments changed this regulation, and the time for calculating grain retention in rice-producing areas is still rice to rice.

In the past, grain for the rural population was supplied with grain coupons. This method had many shortcomings. Grain coupons were issued from the province to the household through various levels. Some counties, districts, and townships often withheld reserve grain, so that the actual needs of the masses could not be met. Grain coupons were also often not issued to households in a timely manner. The phenomenon of buying and selling grain coupons was also very common. Now, the grain departments in Anhui Province have implemented a method that combines coupons and certificates, that is, the grain coupons are stapled into the grain certificates. The grain certificates have the name, address, and designated location. After the unified purchase ends, the coupons and certificates are issued to the household once a year. Neither can be used to purchase grain without the other. This avoids the phenomenon of withholding, delaying, and buying and selling grain coupons.

The grain departments in Anhui Province have also generally implemented a method of allocating grain based on population in rural areas. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions are formulating plans for allocating grain based on population in conjunction with preliminary distribution plans. With this method, adults in rice-growing areas can receive 600 to 650 catties of grain, and those in coarse grain areas can also receive more than 400 catties. In this way, within the national retention standard, the grain consumption of each person can be made more reasonable.

### 便利群众　有利国家  安徽改变粮食供应办法

    便利群众　有利国家
    安徽改变粮食供应办法
    本报合肥29日电　安徽省粮食部门在边整边改中，对执行统购统销的一些办法进行了改革，这些改革对群众和国家都有很大好处。
    安徽去年曾经规定：一部分遭灾的产稻地区农村粮食留用量计算年度，从当年5月到次年6月，在麦收后群众以麦接稻。但因产稻区群众种麦不多，接不上秋季的稻米，这时国家便又要供应。秋季收稻后，因为要扣除麦收后供应的这一部分口粮，秋季留粮又往往接不上第二年的小麦。这就造成了群众“寅吃卯粮”，国家增大了买进卖出的数量，既浪费粮食，群众和国家还都感到不便。最近，粮食部门改变了这一规定，凡产稻地区粮食留量计算时间，仍然以稻接稻。
    农村人口的粮食以前是凭粮票供应的，这种办法有不少缺点。粮票从省到户，层层发放，有的县、区、乡往往扣留机动粮，使群众实际需要得不到满足；粮票也往往不能及时发到户；买卖粮票的现象也很多。现在安徽省粮食部门实行了票、证结合的办法，即把粮票钉在粮证里，粮证上有姓名、住址、定点，票、证在统购结束以后，一年一次发到户，二者缺一都不能购买粮食。这就避免了从中扣发、迟发，以及买卖粮票等现象发生。
    安徽省粮食部门对农村还普遍实行了以人定量的分配粮食办法，各地农业社正结合预分方案拟制以人定量的方案。实行这个办法，稻田地区成年人可分到六百到六百五十斤的口粮，杂粮地区也可以分到四百斤以上。这样，在国家留量标准以内，就能使每一个人的粮食消费情况趋于合理了。
