    In the Dense Forest (Plus One Chapter)
    ——Jottings from the Frontier
    Gu Gong

    Sunlight shone through the hedgehog-like horsetail pines, imprinting mottled patterns on the ground. Many golden pine needles, like fallen hairpins, covered the ground with a thick, elastic layer. Maroon and mulberry-colored pine cones were scattered everywhere. Ah! How deep and secluded it is here, how quiet, with only a faint "whoosh" sound. Is it the murmur of a distant mountain spring, or the gentle laughter of the wind and pine branches together?…

    At that moment, a string of copper bells suddenly rang out. Is it the lamasery performing evening prayers? Is a devout Buddhist passing by? No! Between the closely packed tree trunks, a long line of horses emerged, red tassels fluttering on their heads, colorful stone beads hanging from their necks, and rice sacks sewn from cowhide on their backs...

    I greeted them enthusiastically in Chinese:
    "Old folks, where are you going?"

    The two young men leading the horses replied cheerfully in Tibetan:
    "We're delivering military supplies to 'Mami' (note)..."

    For a long, long time, these words of delivering military supplies, the sound of these bells delivering military supplies, still echoed in the dense forest, deeper than the murmur of the mountain spring, more touching than the gentle laughter of the wind and pine branches....
    (Note) "Mami" means soldier, referring to the People's Liberation Army.

        Morning
    I spent a very sweet night in the dense forest, accompanied by squirrels.

    I broke off a few lush pine branches and built a green shack by the tree roots; I also dug some pine resin from the thick tree trunks for lighting. Ah! I had my own lodge and bright lights…

    In the morning, squirrels suddenly poked their curious eyes out of this tree hole, and then flicked their long tails out of that tree hole; they even spat various wild fruit pits and pine nut shells onto my face and hands, finally waking me up.

    Ah! What a wonderful morning! The dense leaves filtered the sunlight into thousands of golden threads, hanging in the air. *Pudilan* and some low plants bloomed with sleepy little flowers.

    Ah! Only now did I notice that on this and that tree trunk, pine resin had been dug out; under this and that tree trunk, there were shacks made of pine branches. Were woodcutters sleeping inside? Or hunters? Were they herders looking for their horses? Or soldiers patrolling the frontier?…

    I hoped the squirrels would be quieter, even quieter, so as not to disturb these masters of the dense forest who were sleeping soundly.

    密林中（外一章）
    ——在边疆写下的散记
    顾工
    阳光透过刺猬似地马尾松，在地上印下斑烂的图案。许多金色的松针，像是脱落下来的发簪，在地上铺了厚厚的带有弹性的一层。枣红色的、桑椹色的松果，也在到处滚落。啊！这里是多么幽深，这里是多么静悄，只有隐隐地“哗哗”声，这是远处山泉的低语，还是风和松枝在一起发出的轻笑？……
    这时，忽然传来一串铜铃的声响，是喇嘛寺在作晚祷吗？是有一位虔诚拜佛的人从此路过吗？不啊！在密密相挨的树干与树干之间，绕出了一行长长的马队，马头上飘着红色的丝穗，马颈上挂着彩色的石珠，马背上放着牛皮缝成的米袋……
    我用汉语热烈地招呼：
    “老乡，你们去干什么？”
    两个率领马队的青年用藏语欢快地回答：
    “我们给马米（注）送军粮……”
    过了很久很久，这送军粮的话语，这送军粮的铃声，还在密林中萦绕、萦绕，比山泉的低语更深长，比风和松枝的轻笑更动人……。
    （注）马米即军人，指解放军。
        早晨
    我在密林中，伴着松鼠，非常甜蜜地过了一夜。
    我折下几根茂密的松枝，在树根边搭成一个绿色的草棚；我又从粗壮的树干上，挖下一些照明用的松脂。啊！我有了自己的旅栈，也有了明亮的灯火……
    早晨，松鼠忽而从这个树洞中露出好奇的眼睛，忽而又从那个树洞中甩出长长的尾巴；它们又把各种野果子的核，松子的壳，吐到我的脸上、手上，终于把我弄醒了。
    啊！多么美妙的早晨，密密麻麻的树叶，把阳光筛成千万缕金线，一丝丝地悬挂着。扑地兰和几株低矮的植物，开着一些睡眼惺忪的小花。
    啊！这时我才发现，在这根、那根树干上，都有挖过的松脂；在这根、那根树干下，都有松枝搭成的草棚，里面是睡着伐木的民工呢？还是睡着打猎的猎人？是睡着寻找马匹的牧童呢？还是巡逻边疆的士兵？……
    我希望松鼠能安静些、再安静些，不要惊扰这些密林中熟睡的密林的主人。
