　　Uncle Yu finished two large bowls of rice listlessly, silently walked to the stove, and with a clatter, put the dishes in the basin, then stepped over the threshold. Aunt Yu, who had not finished eating, glanced at Uncle Yu and suddenly started scolding:
　　"Are you in such a hurry to be reborn? Where are you dying off to? You just treat the house like a restaurant, putting down your rice bowl and walking away, am I supposed to have three heads and six arms? How am I supposed to water the vegetables? How am I supposed to feed the pigs? How about you teach me!"
　　Faced with his shrewish wife, the production team leader helplessly squatted at the threshold, slowly rolling a pinch of tobacco, and said bitterly:
　　"Alright! Alright! Everyone is about to manage the cooperative's affairs! You'd be happy if I stayed home all day tending to these two plots of private land and these two precious pigs, wouldn't you?"
　　Someone came running in from outside, shouting clumsily before even seeing who it was:
　　"Uncle Yu! Why aren't you out yet?"
　　Aunt Yu, seeing that it was the young man A Lin, scolded him a few times: "You bachelors are so carefree, as soon as you finish dinner you go out to chat and joke around until you've had enough!"
　　The Communist Youth League member A Lin stared at Aunt Yu's temper in confusion, then turned his head and stuck his tongue out at Uncle Yu.
　　Uncle Yu said to Aunt Yu impatiently, "Forget it! Forget it! As long as your two precious pigs don't starve, it's not worth taking it out on everyone you see!"
　　A Lin guessed what was going on, and narrowed his eyes, deliberately saying to Uncle Yu:
　　"That's right! It's best to fatten up the pigs early, anyway the cooperative is going to collapse! You have to rely on yourself!"
　　Aunt Yu widened her eyes and asked strangely, "The cooperative is fine, how could it collapse?"
　　Uncle Yu retorted again impatiently, "That's why I say: you don't go to meetings, you only remember the pigs and vegetables, you wouldn't even know if the sky fell."
　　A Lin said: "That's right! These days it's 'big blooming and contending', people are scolding the cooperative as worthless, people are saying that only disbanding the cooperative will give them a way out!"
　　Aunt Yu had just picked up a piece of meat, but at this moment forgot to put it in her mouth, and said angrily:
　　"Who is so ungrateful?"
　　Uncle Yu saw her anxious look, and somehow his anger all disappeared at once, and said, "Don't just start scolding people, they have a whole set of 'reasons'!"
　　A Lin said: "That's right! Luo Guiying at the village head said: joining the cooperative is not as free as working for the landlord in the past, working can still find a good landlord, work more or less, anyway, get paid by the month, and have two good meals every day!..."
　　"Damn it!" Aunt Yu also stopped her chopsticks: "How come I've worked half my life and never met a good landlord! ...Why didn't you refute him—when has Luo Guiying ever worked for someone? He is always the one being the landlord, hiring casual laborers...Damn it! Why didn't you refute him?"
　　"How could we not refute?" Uncle Yu said: "But can I alone stand up to a whole group of them?"
　　"That's right! Can Uncle Yu alone, as the team leader, stand up to a whole group of well-to-do middle peasants?"
　　"What about our poor brothers? What about our dozens of old cooperative members? Why aren't they saying anything?"
　　"Wasn't I just about to go find them? But you only care about your two precious pigs..." Uncle Yu got angry again.
　　A Lin quickly grabbed the corner of Uncle Yu's clothes and said: "Let's go quickly, if you don't talk to people earlier, how can you alone refute them?"
　　A Lin pulled and dragged him, and pulled Uncle Yu out before Aunt Yu could say anything. But Aunt Yu shouted again:
　　"Hey hey! A Cai's father, leave your flashlight here."
　　"What do you want to do?"
　　"What to do? You're really getting muddled before your time! You know how to connect with others, how come you don't know to call me first? With a flashlight, I can carry A Cai on my back, and hold A Huan, and go! You can borrow some light from A Lin, can't you?"

    山村傍晚
    杨智维
    阿裕叔心不在焉地吃完两大汤碗饭，一声不响地走到灶台边，喀啷一声把碗筷往盆子里一搁，就迈步跨出门槛。还未吃完饭的阿裕婶斜眼看着阿裕叔，突然骂将起来：
    “赶着去投胎吗？死去那里呀？净是把家里当做饭店，搁下饭碗拍拍屁股就走了，我又不是三头六臂的，菜怎么浇？猪怎么喂？这盆衣服怎么洗？你来教教我！”
    对着这个泼辣的妻子，生产队长无可奈何地在门槛边蹲下来，慢摩摩地卷着一撮烟丝，恨恨地说：
    “好啦！好啦！大家都快要管合作社的事啦！我回来整天侍候着这两分自留地和这两只宝贝猪，你就很安乐了罢？”
    门外登登登地跑进一个人来，还没看清人就冒冒失失地喊：
    “阿裕叔！怎么还不出去呀？”
    阿裕婶见是小伙子阿林，就骂他几句：“没有你单身汉这么风流，一吃过晚饭就去跟人晕天扯地，谈笑到够！”
    共青团员阿林莫名其妙地瞪着阿裕婶发脾气，转过头来对阿裕叔吐了吐舌头。
    阿裕叔没好气地向阿裕婶说：“算了算了！反正不饿坏你这两头宝贝猪就算啦，犯不着见到人都出出气！”
    阿林猜到是怎么回事了，他??眼睛，故意对阿裕叔说：
    “是呀！早早把猪养肥它才好，横直合作社都要垮了！得靠自己了！”
    阿裕婶瞪大眼睛奇怪地问：“合作社好端端的，怎么要垮了？”
    阿裕叔又没好气地顶她：“所以说呀：你又不去开会，光记得猪呀菜的，天塌下来也不知道。”
    阿林说：“是呀！这几天‘大放大鸣’，人家把合作社骂得一钱不值，人家都说要散社才有出头日子呢！”
    阿裕婶刚夹着一块肉，这时却忘了送入口，气虎虎地说：
    “是谁这么没良心呀？”
    阿裕叔看到她那急样子，不知怎的气都一下子消了，说：“你别张口就骂人，人家还有大套‘道理’的呢！”
    阿林说：“是呀！村头那个罗桂荣就说：入了社还不如往日给地主打工自由，打工还能碰上个好东家，干多干少都反正按月支工钱，天天有两顿好饭吃！……”
    “他娘的！”阿裕婶把筷子也停下来了：“我怎么打了半世工都碰不上一个好东家！……你们为什么不驳他——他罗桂荣什么时候去打过工来？他倒是常常做东家、请散工……娘的！你们为什么不驳他？”
    “怎么不驳？”阿裕叔说：“可光是我一个人能顶得住人家一伙？”
    “是呀！光是阿裕叔一个队长能顶住人家一伙富裕中农？”
    “我们那些穷哥们呢？我们那几十户老社员呢？怎么不吭气呀？”
    “我这不是正想去找他们吗？可你光是惦记着你那两条宝贝猪……”阿裕叔又气起来了。
    阿林连忙扯住阿裕叔的衣角说：“快走罢，不早些找人们谈谈，光你一个怎么够人家驳呀？”
    阿林又拉又拖，趁阿裕婶还未来得及说话就把阿裕叔拖出来了。可阿裕婶又嚷起来：
    “哎哎！阿彩他爹，把你那手电筒留下来。”
    “你这是想干吗呀？”
    “干吗？你真是未老先糊涂！你懂得去串连别人，怎么不懂得先叫我呀？有手电筒，我背着阿彩，抱着阿环去就行了！你跟阿林借借光不就行了吗？”
