Xinhua News Agency report:

    Since the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, it has been seen in many places around the world, and many places have received the signals it emits.

    Tokyo News: The observation team of Niigata University in Japan saw the Soviet artificial satellite at 18:24:43 on the 5th, using an astronomical telescope. Not only professional observers, but also thousands of non-professional observers, observed this satellite that night. This was the first time the satellite had been seen in Japan. According to the observation team, they saw the artificial satellite flying from southwest to northeast over Niigata, with a brightness equivalent to a magnitude 5.5 star.

    Other areas of Japan were unable to see the satellite due to cloudy skies. However, many places received signals from the artificial satellite at frequencies of 20 megacycles and 40 megacycles more than once.

    New York News: According to the Associated Press, Dr. Whipple, director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, announced that several observation stations in the United States had seen the Soviet artificial satellite. A station in Terre Haute, Indiana, first announced the sighting at 20:50 Eastern Standard Time on the 5th. Columbus, Ohio, also saw the satellite at 22:47 Eastern Standard Time.

    The Radio Corporation of America's Long Island station received the artificial satellite's signal at 8:43 a.m. on the 6th, indicating that the artificial satellite passed almost directly over New York. The head of a radio enthusiast organization in West Hartford, Connecticut, said he was surprised by the strength of the signal he received there.

    In South America, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and Lima in Peru also received the signals. In Ontario, Canada, an airline radio technician also received the signals.

    In Europe, the BBC listening station received the signal at 1:15 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. The Hague radio receiving station received the signal three times on the morning of the 5th. The Agence France-Presse radio receiving station received a clear signal at 7:05 Greenwich Mean Time on the 5th. At the same time, Bern also received the signal. In addition, official or private radio stations in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, West Germany, and Spain also received the signal.

    In Asia, radio stations in major cities such as Calcutta, Madras, and New Delhi in India also received signals from the artificial satellite on this day. Manila in the Philippines also received two signals this afternoon.

    The South African Broadcasting Corporation said it received a strong radio signal from the artificial satellite on the morning of the 5th and made a recording of it, which was broadcast on the national radio network. On this day, the radio station of French Equatorial Africa also received the signal from the artificial satellite.
