　　一百八十多名大力士会师广州
    全国举重锦标赛十九日开幕
    据新华社广州17日电　全国各地著名的举重大力士云集广州，准备参加将于19日到24日在此间举行的1957年全国举重锦标赛。据大会秘书处截至16日下午的统计，目前已有北京、天津、上海、内蒙古、新疆、黑龙江和中国人民解放军等二十七个单位的一百八十多名运动员报到。
    参加1957年全国举重锦标赛的预计将有二十八个到三十个单位，运动员约有一百九十多人，全部都是达到全国等级运动员标准的举重好手。今年8月曾经参加在莫斯科举行的第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的国际竞赛，并取得了辉煌成绩的中国青年举重队的运动员绝大部分都要代表他们原来单位参加这次比赛。陈镜开、陈冠湖代表广东，李白玉、陈家富代表四川，黄强辉代表黑龙江，徐鸿林代表江苏，赵庆奎代表天津，刘云福代表山东，许丽水代表福建，薛德明代表上海，陈永博、殷国华和朱鸿全三人则因受伤未愈，将不参加比赛。原最轻量级全国纪录保持者陈镜开和轻量级全国纪录保持者黄强辉因参加联欢节后，经过了一个时期休养，体重增加了，因此他们将分别报名参加次轻量级、中量级比赛。
