    Combine Learning with Production
    Most Illiterate People in Xihuangcun Township are Now Literate in Over 1,000 Characters
    Plan to Become a New Socialist Countryside with Culture in Five Years
    (Our Newspaper's dispatch) Xihuangcun Township, Shijingshan District, a suburb of Beijing, has achieved remarkable results in eliminating illiteracy. Among the 470 illiterate people in the township participating in cultural studies, more than 160 have reached the standard for literacy (literate in more than 1,500 characters), more than 200 are literate in about 1,000 characters, and the rest are literate in more than 500 characters. Four people have even become work-point recorders.
    Xihuangcun Township has a total of 1,139 households. Among the 1,409 male and female farmers, there are 529 young and middle-aged illiterate people under the age of 40. After liberation, the township established winter schools. Because the schooling was intermittent and the class teaching method was adopted, the results were not significant, just as the masses said, "Going to winter school every year, starting from scratch every year." In the winter of 1955, an anti-illiteracy campaign was launched. After mobilization, most of the illiterate people participated in winter school. However, the study time could not be guaranteed and was often disrupted by work or meetings, which greatly affected the students' morale. By April 1956, the number of students had decreased from 870 to 300. Therefore, the cadres believed that there was a contradiction between learning and production, and that eliminating illiteracy was very difficult. In order to persist in learning and form a movement, the township's party and government leaders made three regulations in April 1956: (1) Ensure the learning time of cadre classes and other classes, and no one shall occupy the learning time for meetings; if it must be occupied, it must be approved by the township party committee and made up at another time. (2) Change the learning method. In addition to compiling classes and levels for learning, all methods that are convenient for students to learn can be used for learning. (3) The cadres of agricultural cooperatives and teams should manage learning. Many production team leaders said, "How can an old roughneck manage culture?" "What if managing culture delays production?" Difficulties were encountered in the implementation of the regulations. After getting through ideological obstacles, experience was gained in the experiment of the second team of the May 4th Cooperative in which the captain managed learning. Within two or three months, most of the captains also took charge of cultural learning. After the production team leaders took charge of cultural learning, the contradiction between learning and production was resolved. Therefore, the leadership mobilized the 388 intellectuals in the township and students who had graduated from winter schools to form a large army for eliminating illiteracy, creating conditions for the widespread development of anti-illiteracy work.
    In the process of carrying out anti-illiteracy work, the township also carried out a series of effective organizational measures. The whole township was composed of people's committee, party organization, youth league organization, women's federation, agricultural cooperatives, school leaders and other persons in charge to form an anti-illiteracy association, and four branch associations were established according to the region, and member groups were established under the branch associations. The member group is the basic combat unit. All the members participating in anti-illiteracy work in the township formed 64 anti-illiteracy groups, each group was responsible for five or six households or a production team. The task of the group is to investigate the illiteracy situation, promote mobilization, organize learning, teaching, and inspection, and contract all illiterate people in the responsibility area of the group, and be responsible to the end. They have created a variety of learning forms, such as class and group learning, field review; field learning, home review; home tutoring, field review; as well as kang-head groups, cadre classes, and word-sending blocks. After the upsurge of learning was set off in the whole township, 90% of the illiterate people participated in the learning. Everyone's enthusiasm for learning is very high. As soon as you enter the village, literacy signs are hung on the streets, small blackboards are erected in the fields, the characters on the Spring Festival couplets have become textbooks, and the stove platforms, walls, and even glass windows have become small blackboards.
    The remarkable results achieved in eliminating illiteracy in Xihuangcun Township have not affected the increase in production of agricultural cooperatives. Taking the May 4th Agricultural Cooperative as an example, the average dividend per household in 1956 was 512 yuan, an increase of 82 yuan compared with 1955, and 78.3% of the members increased their income. On the basis of the achievements already made, the township's party and government leaders and the masses are more confident in eliminating illiteracy, and further plan to completely eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in the entire township within five years, so that the entire township will become a new socialist countryside with culture.

### 把学习和生产结合起来  西黄村乡大部分文盲识字一千以上  计划在五年内成为有文化的新农村

    把学习和生产结合起来
    西黄村乡大部分文盲识字一千以上
    计划在五年内成为有文化的新农村
    本报讯　北京市郊石景山区西黄村乡扫除文盲工作获得显著成绩。全乡参加文化学习的四百七十个文盲中，已经有一百六十多人达到了扫盲的标准（已识字一千五百个以上），二百多人识到一千字左右，其余的也识到五百多字，并有四个人当了记工员。
    西黄村乡共有一千一百三十九户，在一千四百零九名男女农民中，四十岁以下的青壮年文盲有五百二十九人。该乡在解放后就成立了冬学。因为时学时断，采取的是班级教学方法，成绩不大，正像群众说的“年年上冬学，年年从头学。”1955年冬开展扫盲运动，经过动员，大部分文盲参加了冬学。但是学习时间不能保证，常常被工作或会议打乱，学员情绪大受影响。到1956年4月，学员由八百七十人减到三百人。干部们因此就认为学习和生产有矛盾，扫除文盲很困难。乡的党政领导方面，为了把学习坚持下去，并形成运动，在1956年4月作出了三条规定：（一）保证干部班及班级学习的时间，任何人不得占用学习时间开会；如果必须占用时，一定要经过乡党委批准，并要用另外的时间补上。（二）改变学习方式，除编班、编级学习外，可以利用一切便于学员学习的方式进行学习。（三）农业社、队的干部要管学习。很多生产队长说：“老粗哪能管文化”，“管文化耽误生产怎么办”？执行规定中遇到了困难。经过打通思想，同时在五四社的二队实验中，取得了队长管学习的经验。多数队长在两三个月内，也都把文化学习管了起来了。生产队长管起文化学习以后，就使学习与生产上的矛盾获得了解决。于是领导方面又把在乡知识分子和已经在冬学学习结业的学生三百八十八人，组成一支扫盲的大军，为广泛开展扫盲工作创造了条件。
    在开展扫盲工作的过程中，该乡还进行了一系列的有效的组织措施。全乡由乡人民委员会、党组织、青年团组织、妇联、农业社、学校等负责人组成扫盲协会，按地区成立了四个分会，分会下设会员小组。会员小组是基层战斗单位。全乡参加扫盲工作的会员，组成了六十四个扫盲小组，每个小组负责五、六家或一个生产小组。小组的任务是调查文盲情况，宣传动员，组织学习、教学、检查，对本小组责任地段内的文盲全部包干，负责到底。他们创造了多种多样的学习形式，如班、组学习，地头复习；地头学习、回家复习；在家包教，地头复习；以及炕头组、干部班、送字块等方法。全乡学习热潮掀起来以后，有90％的文盲都参加了学习。大家的学习热情很高，一进村，街头挂着识字牌，地头竖着小黑板，春联上的字成了课本，锅台上、墙上，甚至玻璃窗成了小黑板。
    西黄村乡扫盲获得这样显著的成绩，并没有影响农业社的增产。以五四农业社为例，1956年平均每户分红五百一十二元，比1955年增加八十二元，有78.3％的社员增加了收入。在已获得成绩的基础上，该乡党政领导方面和群众，对扫盲更满怀信心，进一步计划在五年内全部扫除全乡青壮年中的文盲，使全乡变成为有文化的新农村。
