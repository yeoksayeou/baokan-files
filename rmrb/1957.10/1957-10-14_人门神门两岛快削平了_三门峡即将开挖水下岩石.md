    Renmen and Shenmen Islands Are Being Quickly Leveled
    Sanmenxia Is About to Excavate Underwater Rocks
    (Our Dispatch) Since the first shot to conquer the Yellow River rang out over Sanmenxia on April 13, the face of Sanmenxia has been changing dramatically. By the end of September, workers had completed approximately 195,000 cubic meters of rock excavation for the dam foundation. This amount of rock would require 97,500 trucks to carry it all; if these trucks were lined up end to end, their length would be equivalent to a railway line from Beijing to Baotou.
    Now, two-thirds of Renmen Island has been dug away, and about one-third of Shenmen Island has been removed; the dam foundation excavation has reached an elevation of 284 meters, and a little further down, it will be level with the water surface. The excavation work for the upstream and downstream foundation pits has already begun, and large-scale underwater rock excavation is about to begin.
    The leveling project for the right bank batching plant base and the construction of the motor vehicle base have made great progress. The first phase of the cofferdam project is also about to begin.

    人门神门两岛快削平了
    三门峡即将开挖水下岩石
    本报讯　自从4月13日三门峡上空第一次响起征服黄河的炮声以来，三门峡的面貌在急剧地变化着。到9月底，工人们约已完成坝基开挖十九万五千公方石方。这些石方需用九万七千五百辆汽车才能载完；把这些汽车首尾相接，它的长度，相当于一条北京到包头的铁路。
    现在人门岛已经被挖去三分之二，神门岛削去了约三分之一；坝基开挖已至284高程，再往下挖一点，就和水面切平了。上、下游基坑开挖工作已经开始，大规模的水下岩石开挖工程即将进行。
    右岸拌合楼基地的平场工程和修建汽车基地等工程都有了很大的进展。第一期围堰工程也即将开始。
