Xinhua News Agency, New York, 4th: Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi warned Western aggressors that Egypt would never allow a single finger or hair of Syria to be harmed. He also said that now is the time for Western countries to "restrain themselves" from their wild clamoring against Syria.

Fawzi made the remarks on October 3 at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly during the continuation of the general debate.

The Egyptian Foreign Minister said, "Syria is Egypt's ally, Egypt's flesh and blood. It is fully entitled to Egypt's help and the United Nations' help to defeat any aggression that may be launched against it." "Egypt will not even allow aggressors to harm a finger or a hair of Syria. If this happens, Egypt will immediately rise up as a whole and stand firmly with its Syrian brothers."

Fawzi said that Syria's measures to strengthen its own defense were its "indisputable right" and "need not be accounted for to anyone." He believed that Western clamoring about "Syria threatening peace" was as fragile as a balloon.

He condemned Western Middle East policies as treating the Middle East as their "country club" or "constituency." He also accused the West of using the supply or non-supply of weapons as a means of exerting pressure and enticement on Middle Eastern countries.

In his speech, Fawzi also reiterated the Arab countries' accusations against Israel for disregarding UN resolutions on Palestine.

Speaking on the Suez Canal issue, Fawzi said that Egypt had allocated more than 3 million pounds to develop the canal, and would continue to allocate funds in the future. Egypt is also considering the issue of compensation for the old Suez Canal Company.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 4th: US President Eisenhower said at a press conference on October 3 that the United States was watching the development of the situation in Syria with "great concern." He said that the United States believes that the situation in Syria seems to have stabilized to a certain extent, but it is still necessary to wait a week or two to see the "further development" of the situation. The United States will continue to watch it, study it, and consult with its allies.

Eisenhower expressed disagreement with the part of the speech made by Saudi Arabian representative Shukairy at the United Nations General Assembly on the 2nd, namely that whichever government is in power in Syria is the country's internal affair. He said that he hoped others would know America's "concern." He hoped to "win people over" by "pointing out the dangers of the situation" and providing military and economic "aid."

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 3rd: The Liaison Committee of the People's Congresses of the Arab Countries issued a statement sharply condemning the United States' imperialist policy in the Middle East and calling on all Arab people to be more vigilant and strengthen their ranks to crush any imperialist conspiracy aimed at opposing Arab nationalism.

The statement fiercely criticized the US-launched campaign against Syria, and emphasized that the United States is attempting to use this to rudely interfere in Syria's internal affairs.

The statement also sharply condemned Britain's acts of aggression against Yemen and Oman, as well as France's actions against Algeria.

    埃及外长警告西方侵略者
    不许损伤叙利亚一指一发
    艾森豪威尔表示要继续颠覆叙利亚政府
    据新华社4日讯　纽约消息：埃及外交部长法齐警告西方侵略者：埃及决不容许叙利亚的一指一发受到损伤。他还说，现在是西方国家“克制一下”对叙利亚狂妄叫嚣的时候了。
    法齐是在联合国大会10月3日全体会议继续进行一般辩论时发言的。
    这位埃及外交部长说：“叙利亚是埃及的盟国，埃及的骨肉，它是完全应当得到埃及的帮助和联合国的帮助来击败可能对它发动的任何侵略的。”“埃及甚至不容许侵略者损伤叙利亚一个手指头或者一根头发，如果发生这种事情，埃及是要立刻全体起来并且同它的叙利亚兄弟国家坚定地站在一起的。”
    法齐说，叙利亚为加强它自己的国防所采取的措施是它“无可争辩的权利”，“不需要向任何人来交代”。他认为西方关于“叙利亚威胁和平”的叫嚣像气球一样脆弱。
    他谴责西方的中东政策是把中东看成它们的“乡村俱乐部”或“选区”。他还指责西方利用供应或者不供应武器作为向中东国家施加压力和引诱的手段。
    法齐在发言中还重申了阿拉伯国家对以色列无视联合国关于巴勒斯坦的决议的指责。
    法齐在谈到苏伊士运河问题时说，埃及已经拨出三百多万英镑来发展这条运河，以后还要继续拨款。埃及也还考虑到对旧苏伊士运河公司的赔偿问题。
    据新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔10月3日在记者招待会上说，美国“很关心地”注视着叙利亚局势的发展。他说，美国认为，叙利亚局势似乎已经在一定的程度上稳定下来，但是仍然要等一两个星期来看看局势的“进一步发展”。美国要继续注视它、研究它并且同盟国进行商谈。
    艾森豪威尔表示不同意沙特阿拉伯代表舒凯里2日在联合国大会上发言中的这一部分，即无论那个政府在叙利亚执政，都是这个国家的内政。他说，他希望别人能够知道美国的“关怀”。他希望可以“通过指出局势的危险性”以及进行军事和经济“援助”来“争取人们”。
    据新华社3日讯　塔斯社大马士革2日讯：阿拉伯各国人民大会联络委员会发表声明，尖锐地谴责美国对中东地区的帝国主义政策，并且号召全体阿拉伯人民提高警惕和更加团结自己的队伍，来粉碎以反对阿拉伯民族主义为目的的任何帝国主义阴谋。
    声明激烈抨击了美国发动的反对叙利亚的运动，并且着重说，美国企图借此粗暴地干涉叙利亚的内政。
    声明还尖锐谴责了英国对也门和阿曼的侵略行动以及法国对阿尔及利亚的行动。
