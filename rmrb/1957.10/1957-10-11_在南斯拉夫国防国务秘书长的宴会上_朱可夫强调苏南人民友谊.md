Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, October 10th - Soviet Defense Minister Zhukov attended a welcome banquet held in his honor by Yugoslav State Secretary of National Defense, Gosnjak, on the 8th. At the banquet, he said: The foundation of the friendship between the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples lies in the fact that the people of both countries are Slavic nations, share a common culture, have a long history of common struggle against the same enemy, and share the immortal ideals of the great October Socialist Revolution.

Zhukov also said that the Soviet Union's recent launch of the world's first artificial Earth satellite is an important contribution to world science and a major achievement of the Soviet people. He added that the socio-economic and cultural transformation of the Soviet Union over the past forty years has made it possible for the Soviet armed forces to be "equipped with the latest first-class weapons, including atomic and hydrogen weapons, as well as the most sophisticated radio positioning, jet, and rocket technology, including intercontinental ballistic missiles."

Gosnjak said in his welcoming speech at the banquet that he welcomed Marshal Zhukov, and at the same time, he welcomed the glorious Soviet army. He said that the Yugoslav people deeply respect the Soviet army and are grateful for its assistance and sacrifices in the final battle to liberate Yugoslavia from fascist occupation. He added that it was in these common battles, in the process of shedding blood together, that the foundation of friendship and comradely relations between the Soviet and Yugoslav armies was laid. We should continue to develop our relations on the basis of these glorious combat traditions.

On the 9th, Marshal Zhukov and his entourage laid wreaths at the cemetery where Soviet and Yugoslav soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the battle to liberate Belgrade were buried, and then visited the Yugoslav People's Army Advanced Military Academy.

    在南斯拉夫国防国务秘书长的宴会上
    朱可夫强调苏南人民友谊
    据新华社贝尔格莱德10日电　苏联国防部长朱可夫8日出席南斯拉夫国防国务秘书长戈什尼亚克为他举行的欢迎宴会。他在宴会上说：苏联和南斯拉夫人民的友谊的基础，就是两国人民同是斯拉夫民族，有着共同的文化，反对同一个敌人的长期共同斗争，以及伟大的十月社会主义革命的不朽思想。
    朱可夫还说，苏联最近发射了世界上第一颗人造地球卫星，这是对世界科学的重要贡献，也是苏联人民所取得的重大成就。他又说，苏联过去四十年中，在社会经济和文化上的转变使得苏联武装部队有可能“装备最新式的第一流武器，其中包括原子武器和氢武器以及最复杂的无线电定位、喷气和包括洲际弹道火箭在内的火箭技术。”
    戈什尼亚克在宴会上致欢迎词说，他欢迎朱可夫元帅，同时也就是欢迎光荣的苏联军队。他说，南斯拉夫人民非常尊敬苏联军队，对它在使南斯拉夫从法西斯占领下解放出来的最后战斗中所作的援助和牺牲表示感谢。他又说，就在这些共同的战斗中，在一起流血的过程中，建立起了苏南两国军队之间的友谊和同志关系的基础。我们应该在这些光荣的战斗传统的基础上继续发展我们的关系。
    9日，朱可夫元帅和随行人员曾到埋葬在解放贝尔格莱德的战役中牺牲的苏联和南斯拉夫士兵的墓地献花圈，随后访问了南斯拉夫人民军高级军事学院。
