Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 7th - Liu Changsheng, head of the Chinese Trade Union delegation attending the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, delivered a speech on the first item on the agenda at the conference on the afternoon of October 5th.

    Liu Changsheng said: President Vittorio's opening speech and Secretary-General Saillant's report provided a comprehensive analysis of the work of the World Federation of Trade Unions, a detailed exposition of the situation of the world trade union movement, and raised many important questions. These are of great enlightenment and help to the discussions of the conference.

    He pointed out that since the Third World Trade Union Congress, the world trade union movement has surged. Friendly cooperation and unified solidarity between trade union organizations in various countries have developed.

    He especially mentioned the great role played by the working class around the world in promoting the ceasefire in Vietnam, supporting the anti-colonialist struggle of the Algerian people, and especially in supporting the Egyptian people's struggle to defend national sovereignty. He said that at present, the working class around the world and all people of justice around the world are closely watching the imperialists' schemes of aggression against Syria and the continuing war of aggression in Algeria. We will never allow the imperialists to do whatever they want! We firmly support the just and heroic struggles of the Syrian people and the Algerian people until they achieve victory!

    Although the vast number of workers and trade union organizations in various countries around the world have different situations and political views, they have common goals, namely: to defend world peace, oppose imperialism, oppose colonialism, oppose monopoly capital, defend trade union rights, strive to improve living conditions, and demand friendly cooperation.

    Liu Changsheng continued: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese trade unions are mobilizing and organizing the masses of workers and staff to build their own happy new lives with their own peaceful labor. He described the great achievements made by the Chinese working class in various fields. He emphasized: "Our achievements in work are due not only to our own efforts, but also to learning from the advanced experience of the fraternal trade unions of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and to the sympathy and support of the working brothers of all countries around the world." As the working class around the world is preparing to solemnly commemorate its great festival—the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution—the Chinese working class extends fraternal greetings to the Soviet working class!

    Liu Changsheng also spoke about the achievements of the Chinese trade unions in actively carrying out international activities in the spirit of internationalism.

    He continued: The unified solidarity of the working class is the most powerful guarantee for winning victory. In order to effectively oppose international monopoly capital, defend world peace, and protect the vital interests of the working class, we hope that trade union organizations of various countries will unite on an international scale.

    However, there is a serious division in the current international trade union movement, which is detrimental to the struggle of the international working class against common enemies. The Chinese trade unions believe that some of the principles put forward by Comrade Saillant in his report on establishing and developing international trade union ties are correct. That is, in promoting the unified solidarity of international trade unions, it is necessary to adopt the principles of equality and voluntariness, mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and friendly consultation. If we act on these principles, with patience and sincerity, it will be possible to gradually improve relations between trade union organizations of various political persuasions. The Chinese trade unions are willing to develop friendly ties with trade union organizations of all factions in various countries and work together with them to promote the unified solidarity of the international trade union movement.

    Liu Changsheng finally spoke about strengthening cooperation with independent trade unions. He expressed his belief that the Fourth Congress will put forward correct propositions and continue to promote the unified solidarity of the international working class.

    At the end of his speech, the entire audience stood up and applauded for a long time.

    Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 7th - The Fourth World Trade Union Congress began discussing the first item on the agenda on the morning of October 5th, discussing the report of World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary-General Louis Saillant on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions and on the development of fraternal relations and solidarity of the international trade union movement in the struggle to improve the living standards of the working people, to strive for their economic, social and democratic rights, and to strive for disarmament, peace and national independence.

    Uruguayan representative Cardona suggested in his speech that in order to achieve new achievements in the cause of building the unity of the international trade union movement, an international consultation conference of representatives of various trade union organizations should be convened.

    After the representatives of Ceylon and the International Textile and Garment Workers' Union spoke, Soviet representative Grishin spoke.

    Grishin said that the situation facing this World Trade Union Congress is that the imperialists' aggressive activities have created a tense situation in many parts of the world, especially the Middle East, which contains great dangers to the cause of peace and requires the world working class, other progressive forces, and all people to be vigilant. The task of struggle for all working people, including trade unions, is to smash the imperialists' dirty schemes, stop their colonialist intentions, and not allow the launch of a new war.

    He said: The World Federation of Trade Unions firmly demands a halt to the arms race, a ban on atomic weapons, and first and foremost a ban on testing atomic weapons. The role of the World Federation of Trade Unions in resolving major international issues contributes to the victory of the working class in its struggle to achieve its socio-economic demands.

    Grishin then spoke about the activities of the Soviet trade unions.

    Grishin then said that there are now many major tasks facing the world trade union and workers' movement, the main of which is to fight for peace, against the threat of a new world war, for complete disarmament and a ban on thermonuclear weapons, and to fight for a cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons as a first step towards a complete ban on such weapons. For the sake of the future, the working class should unite all the people around itself to solve this most urgent and pressing task.

    He pointed out: Now the world trade union movement is divided. The disunity and relaxation of the trade union movement weakens the strength of the working class. The task of all faithful trade union activists and all progressive forces is to strive for unity and to expose the divisive activities of the enemy in undermining unity. The necessary conditions for achieving unity exist. The world working class faces the same tasks. The struggle to ease international tensions, against the arms race, for a ban on thermonuclear weapons, and to improve the living standards of the working people is the real basis for unified action by various trade union organizations.

    Subsequently, Sudanese Trade Union Federation representative Abdurahman Haq and Free German Trade Union Federation Central Council Secretary Kirchner spoke successively.

    Representatives of Kamminx (Trinidad) and the Bolivian trade unions also spoke at the morning session of the congress.

    刘长胜在世界工会代表大会上呼吁
    共同努力促进国际工会团结
    苏联代表要求提高警惕制止侵略阴谋
    新华社来比锡7日电　出席世界工会第四次代表大会的中国工会代表团团长刘长胜在10月5日下午大会会议上就第一项议程作了发言。
    刘长胜说：维多里奥主席的开幕词和赛扬总书记的报告，对世界工联的工作作了全面的分析，对世界工会运动的形势作了详细的论述，并且提出了不少重要问题。这些对大会的讨论是有重大的启发和帮助的。
    他指出，自从世界工会第三次代表大会以来，世界工会运动有了高涨。各国工会组织之间的友好合作和统一团结有了发展。
    他特别谈到全世界工人阶级在促使越南停战，支援阿尔及利亚人民的反殖民主义的斗争，特别在支援埃及人民保卫国家主权的斗争中，发挥了伟大的作用。他说，目前全世界工人阶级和全世界一切正义人士，正在密切注视着帝国主义者对叙利亚的侵略阴谋和在阿尔及利亚继续着的侵略战争。我们决不会听任帝国主义者为所欲为！我们坚决支持叙利亚人民和阿尔及利亚人民的正义英勇斗争，一直到他们胜利为止！
    全世界各国广大工人与工会组织虽然各自的处境和政治主张有所不同，但是他们却有着共同目标，那就是：保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、反对垄断资本、保卫工会权利、争取改善生活条件和要求友好合作。
    刘长胜接着说：中国工会在中国共产党领导下，正在动员和组织职工群众，以他们自己的和平劳动来建设自己的幸福的新生活。他叙述了中国工人阶级在各方面所取得的巨大成就。他强调指出：“我们工作上的成就，除了由于我们自己的努力以外，还由于学习了苏联和各人民民主国家兄弟工会的先进经验，得到了全世界各国工人兄弟们的同情和支援。”当今天全世界工人阶级正在准备隆重地纪念自己的伟大节日——十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，中国工人阶级向苏联工人阶级致以兄弟般的祝贺！
    刘长胜还讲到中国工会本着国际主义的精神，在努力开展国际活动方面的成就。
    他接着说：工人阶级的统一团结是争取胜利的最有力的保证。为了有效地反对国际垄断资本、保卫世界和平，为了工人阶级的切身利益，我们希望各国工会组织在国际范围内团结起来。
    但是，在当前国际工会运动中存在着严重的分裂局面，这对于国际工人阶级反对共同敌人的斗争是不利的。中国工会体会到赛扬同志在他的报告中所提出的建立和发展国际工会联系的一些原则是正确的。这就是在推进国际工会统一团结的活动中，有必要采取平等自愿、相互尊重、求同存异、友好协商的原则。如果我们根据这些原则，抱着耐心和诚意，就有可能争取在各种不同政治倾向的工会组织之间逐步改善关系。中国工会愿意与各国各派工会组织发展友好联系，并且同它们一起共同努力，来促进国际工会运动的统一团结。
    刘长胜最后谈到要加强同独立工会的合作。他表示相信第四次大会将提出正确的主张，继续推进国际工人阶级的统一团结。
    他发言结束时，全场一致起立，掌声经久不息。
    据新华社来比锡7日电　世界工会第四次代表大会10月5日上午开始讨论第一项议程，讨论世界工联总书记路易·赛扬关于世界工会活动和关于在争取提高劳动人民生活水平，争取他们的经济、社会和民主权利，争取裁军、和平和民族独立的斗争中国际工会运动的兄弟关系和团结的发展的报告。
    乌拉圭代表卡尔多纳在发言中建议：为了在建立国际工会运动团结一致的事业中取得新的成就，应当召开一个各种工会组织代表的国际协商会议。
    在锡兰代表和纺织服装工人工会国际代表发言后，苏联代表格里申发言。
    格里申说，这次世界工会代表大会所面临的形势是：帝国主义者的侵略活动在世界很多地区，首先是中近东造成了紧张局势，这种情况对和平事业含有很大的危险，要求世界工人阶级，其他进步力量和全体人民提高警惕。全体劳动人民，包括工会在内的斗争任务就在于要粉碎帝国主义者的肮脏阴谋，制止他们的殖民主义意图，不容许发动新战争。
    他说：世界工会联合会坚决要求停止军备竞赛，禁止原子武器，首先是禁止试验原子武器。世界工联在解决重大国际问题上的作用有助于工人阶级争取实现他们社会经济要求斗争的胜利。
    格里申接着谈到苏联工会的活动。
    格里申随后说，现在世界工会和工人运动的面前摆着许多重大的任务，其中主要的任务就是要为争取和平，反对新的世界战争威胁，争取全面裁军和禁止热核武器而斗争，为争取停止试验原子武器和氢武器以作为完全禁止这类武器的第一步而进行斗争。为了未来，工人阶级应当把全体人民团结在自己的周围，以解决这项最迫切的刻不容缓的任务。
    他指出：现在世界工会运动是分裂的。工会运动的涣散松弛削弱了工人阶级的力量。所有的忠实的工会活动家和所有进步力量的任务就是要争取团结一致，并且揭露敌人破坏团结一致的分裂活动。达到团结一致的必要条件是存在的。世界工人阶级面前摆着同样的任务。争取缓和国际紧张局势，反对军备竞赛，争取禁止热核武器，争取提高劳动人民生活水平的斗争就是各个工会组织统一行动的现实基础。
    接着，苏丹工会联合会代表阿卜杜拉赫曼·哈克和自由德国工会联合会中央理事会书记基希纳相继发了言。
    在大会的上午会议上发言的还有卡姆明克斯（特立尼达岛）和玻利维亚工会的代表。
