On the Anti-Rightist Front

    Under the Severe Criticism of All Members of the Jiusan Society in Beijing, Rightists Xue Yu and Three Others Confess Their Crimes

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Jiusan Society convened a meeting of more than 600 members in Beijing on the 20th, systematically exposing and criticizing four rightists: Xue Yu, Yuan Hanqing, Dong Weichuan, and Yang Zhaoxie.

    It was revealed at the meeting that rightists Xue Yu, Yuan Hanqing, Dong Weichuan, and Yang Zhaoxie, using their positions as members of the Standing Committee of the Jiusan Society Central Committee, supported and used rightist Chu Anping’s erroneous “Party Empire” theory to attack the Party. Xue Yu slandered the Ministry of Health as a “Party Empire,” demanding the removal of several deputy ministers who did not understand the work. Yuan Hanqing promoted opposition to “despotism,” attacking the eight deputy secretaries-general of the Academy of Sciences as being Party members. Dong Weichuan slandered Normal University as the Party's "family empire." Yang Zhaoxie opposed the two Party member deputy directors of the Academy of Sciences’ Compilation and Publication Committee, attacking the Party’s personnel system as “sectarianism.” These rightists used the “Party Empire” fallacy to oppose the working class and the leadership of the Party, attempting to shake the foundation of our country.

    Many speakers refuted the rightists’ fallacy that the Party cannot lead cultural, educational, scientific, and health work with ironclad facts. Xue Gongchuo, in his speech, used concrete facts to refute these rightists’ slander of the major achievements of China's scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings.

    Pan Shu focused on criticizing the three reactionary scientific programs proposed by rightist Yuan Hanqing and the fallacy of so-called scientific research "following the person." Yuan Hanqing himself confessed that the essence of the so-called three scientific programs was not much different from the reactionary scientific programs created by rightists Zeng Zhaolun and others.

    Comrade Jin Kemu criticized at the meeting the rightists’ slander of the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and ideological remolding movements, using this to provoke the relationship between intellectuals and the Party.

    Tu Changwang exposed and criticized the four rightists’ ambition to transform the Jiusan Society into a bourgeois political party, gradually achieving their goal of usurping the Party's leadership in the scientific and cultural circles, seizing positions such as deputy mayor, deputy minister, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, deputy president of universities, and vice-chairman of the Jiusan Society.

    The meeting’s speakers also unanimously emphasized criticizing the rightists Yang Zhaoxie, Dong Weichuan, Yuan Hanqing, Xue Yu, and others for resisting ideological remolding by opposing natural science workers studying Marxism-Leninism, denying that Marxism-Leninism is science, advocating the cancellation of the history of the Chinese revolution course, and attacking publications that promote Marxism-Leninism.

    Under the powerful exposure, criticism, and angry condemnation of all attendees, the four rightists had no choice but to bow their heads and confess their crimes, willing to accept remolding and become new people.

    Wang Zhen's Fallacy Has Been Refuted

    The Ministry of Internal Affairs recently convened three meetings of all cadres to criticize the reactionary remarks of Wang Zhen, a rightist within the ministry.

    Wang Zhen slandered, saying: "The Communist Party is a sect that seeks private gain." This fallacy was severely refuted. Everyone conducted in-depth criticism of Wang Zhen's fallacy from aspects such as the nature of the Party, its program, the excellent qualities of the vast majority of Party members, and the Party's strict discipline.

    Wang Zhen also maliciously provoked the relationship between the Party and the peasants, saying: "The Party cannot represent the interests of the peasants." Everyone pointed out: The history of the Chinese revolution proves that only the leadership of the Communist Party can enable the peasants to achieve complete liberation. Everyone questioned Wang Zhen, why did he close his eyes to the facts? If the Communist Party cannot represent the interests of the peasants, who can represent the interests of the peasants? Could it be that the bourgeois rightists can represent the interests of the peasants?

    In the face of ironclad facts, Wang Zhen admitted that he was a vicious rightist, expressed his conviction and submission to the facts and criticisms listed by everyone, surrendered and confessed his crimes to the people, and wanted to be reborn.

    Xining Rightist Jin Gang Attempts to Drag Procuratorial Work to the Right

    Jin Gang, a Party rightist who served as the Chief Procurator of the Xining City People's Procuratorate in Qinghai Province, has recently been exposed.

    After Jin Gang took office as the Chief Procurator of the Xining City People's Procuratorate in January of this year, he quickly dragged the procuratorial work to the right. From the beginning, he appeared in the guise of preventing “leftism,” believing that many cases handled in the past had “errors,” saying that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was “wrong,” and that all handled cases should be reviewed. When judging cases, he spouted the fallacy that "confessions are not evidence," and said that regarding the handling of cases, "I only want to be a middleman, handling procedures." He also tried every possible way to exonerate unlawful landlords, counter-revolutionaries, and other criminals. Those who should be arrested were not approved for arrest, and those who should be prosecuted were not prosecuted. He often suggested that cases were judged "too severely," but never said that there were cases where the punishment was too light. Under his instructions, some cadres of the procuratorate intentionally created difficulties for relevant departments, preventing close cooperation in their work.

    After the rectification movement began, rightist Jin Gang also launched a frenzied attack on the Party and resisted leadership. Not long ago, when the Xining Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting to study the issue of cracking down on unlawful landlords, rich peasants, and criminal elements, he refused to attend despite repeated notifications and urgings.

    Zhu Leqiu Stands with Criminals

    Cadres in the political and legal system of the Daxian Special District in Sichuan Province recently exposed the anti-Party activities of Zhu Leqiu, a Party rightist and president of the Daxian Intermediate People's Court, who had participated in the revolution for twenty years.

    According to reports, Zhu Leqiu advocated "legal independence," believing that "the Party committee's leadership of the court interfered with the independence of the law," and said frantically, "The CCP Prefectural Committee cannot represent the Communist Party."

    When the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, Zhu Leqiu believed that the opportunity to "rehabilitate" and "vindicate" criminals had arrived. Without consulting with the original sentencing units, he arbitrarily approved the release of more than 270 criminals. Regarding the handling of many specific cases, Zhu Leqiu did his best to exonerate the criminals.

    Zhu Leqiu consistently distorted and attacked the Party's policies. He clamored that "law has no class nature," and slandered that cadres in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement had "weak legal concepts."

    在九三学社北京全体社员的严厉批判下
    薛愚等四个右派分子服罪
    本报讯　九三学社于20日召开了北京全体社员六百多人的大会，对薛愚、袁翰青、董渭川、杨肇燫等四个右派分子进行了有系统的揭发和批判。
    会上揭露：右派分子薛愚、袁翰青、董渭川、杨肇燫利用了九三学社中央常务委员的名义和地位，支持和利用右派分子储安平“党天下”的谬论向党进攻。薛愚诬蔑卫生部是“党天下”，要去掉几个不懂业务的党员副部长。袁翰青宣传反对“专制主义”，攻击科学院的八个副秘书长都是党员。董渭川诬蔑师范大学是党的“家天下”。杨肇燫则反对科学院编译出版委员会两位党员副主任，攻击党的人事制度是“宗派主义”。这些右派分子运用“党天下”谬论来反对工人阶级和党的领导，企图动摇我们国家的根本。
    许多发言者以铁的事实驳斥了右派分子说的党不能领导文教、科学、卫生工作的谬论。薛公绰在发言中用具体的事实驳斥这些右派分子对我国科学文教事业的重大成就的污蔑。
    潘菽在会上着重批判了右派分子袁翰青提出的三条反动科学纲领和所谓以科学研究“就人”的谬论。袁翰青自己交代的所谓三条科学纲领实质上和右派分子曾昭抡等所制造的反动科学纲领是没有多大出入的。
    金克木同志在会上批判了右派分子诬蔑三反、肃反、思想改造等五大运动借以挑拨知识分子和党的关系的胡说。
    涂长望揭发和批判了四个右派分子要把九三学社变为资产阶级政党，逐步达到他们篡夺党在科学文教界的领导权、夺取副市长、副部长、全国人民代表大会常务委员、副校长、九三学社副主席等职位的野心。
    大会发言还一致着重批判了右派分子杨肇燫、董渭川、袁翰青、薛愚等反对自然科学工作者学习马列主义、否定马列主义是科学、主张取消中国革命史课程、攻击宣传马列主义的刊物等抗拒思想改造的谬论。
    四个右派分子在全体与会人员的有力地揭发批判和愤怒斥责下，不能不低头认罪，愿意接受改造，重新作人。
    王臻谬论已被驳倒
    内务部最近召开了三次全体干部大会，批判该部右派分子王臻的反动言论。
    王臻污蔑说：“共产党是一个图私利的宗派”。这一谬论受到严厉的驳斥。大家从党的性质，纲领，广大党员的优秀品质和党的严肃纪律等方面，对王臻的谬论进行了深入的批判。
    王臻还恶意地挑拨党与农民的关系说：“党不能代表农民利益”。大家指出：中国革命的历史证明，只有共产党的领导才能使农民获得彻底解放。大家质问王臻为什么闭着眼睛不看事实，共产党不能代表农民利益，谁能代表农民利益呢？难道资产阶级右派分子能代表农民利益吗？
    在铁的事实面前，王臻承认了自己是一个恶毒的右派分子，对大家列举的各项事实和批判表示心服口服，向人民服输认罪，要脱胎换骨，重新作人。
    西宁右派分子金刚企图把检察工作拉向右转
    担任青海省西宁市人民检察院检察长的党内右派分子金刚，已经在最近被揭露出来。
    金刚在今年1月担任西宁市人民检察院检察长以后，迅速把检察工作拉向右转。一开始他就以防“左”的面目出现，认为过去办的案子有许多“错误”，说肃反搞“错”了，要把所有处理过的案子进行一次复查。他在判案时，大发“口供不是证据”的谬论，并说对案件的处理“我只愿当个中间人，办办手续就行了”。他还想尽办法给不法地主、反革命分子和其他犯罪分子开脱罪责。该逮捕的不批准逮捕，该起诉的不起诉。他经常提出案件判得“重”了，却从来没有说有过轻判的案件。在他的指使下，检察院的某些干部就有意和有关部门为难，不能密切合作进行工作。
    右派分子金刚在整风开始后还向党猖狂进攻和对抗领导。不久前，中共西宁市委召开会议研究打击不法地主、富农和刑事犯罪分子的问题时，几次通知催促，他都拒不出席。（新华社专稿）
    朱乐秋同罪犯站在一起
    四川省达县专区政法系统的干部，最近揭露了已参加革命二十年的党内右派分子、达县中级人民法院院长朱乐秋的反党活动。
    据揭露，朱乐秋主张“法律独立”，认为“党委领导法院是干扰了法律的独立性”，并猖狂地说，“中共地委不能代表共产党”。
    当资产阶级右派分子向党猖狂进攻时，朱乐秋认为替罪犯“平反”“申冤”的机会到了，他不和原判单位研究，便擅自批准释放了二百七十多名罪犯。对许多具体案件的处理，朱乐秋都极力为犯罪者开脱。
    朱乐秋一贯歪曲和攻击党的政策。他叫嚣“法律没有阶级性”，诬蔑镇压反革命运动干部“法制观念薄弱”。
