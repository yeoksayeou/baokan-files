    This year, Luotian County, Hubei Province, has seen a general bumper harvest of chestnuts. It is estimated that this year's chestnut production will reach 3.6 million jin. At present, the grassroots supply and marketing stores of the Luotian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative are purchasing them in large quantities at reasonable prices. In addition to sales within the county, it is estimated that 500,000 jin can be shipped to support the people in the cities in celebrating National Day.        (Wang Jichao)
