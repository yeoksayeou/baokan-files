    The exhibits at the Hunan Folk Arts and Crafts Exhibition, hosted by the Chinese Artists Association, totaled about 400 pieces, most of which were collected by the Hunan Provincial Bureau of Culture and the Provincial Bureau of Handicraft Industry. The main part belongs to the creations of the Tujia, Miao, Yao, and Dong ethnic minorities in southwestern Hunan, and the creations of the Han people in the ethnic minority areas. The weavings and embroideries of the Tujia and Miao ethnic groups in western Hunan are particularly rich in variety. The weavings are bright in color and magnificent in pattern. The cross-stitch embroidery is even more unique in style. Taking the theme of "Flower-Piercing Phoenix" embroidery as an example, there are dozens of excellent and healthy patterns, which are truly beautiful. Each work of art is intertwined with intense and thick emotions, giving people a fresh and pleasant impression. In the past, it was rarely known. At the preview, an old Mr. Huang said, "I am a Hunanese, and I have lived for sixty or seventy years, and I didn't know that Hunan had so many good things!" In fact, its creation and existence have been for many years, just like all the excellent qualities of the working people. Because the ruling class of the old society never paid attention to it, the average person naturally has no way of knowing.
    The Miao and Tujia ethnic groups were originally two ancient members of our motherland's ethnic family. According to historical narratives, during the transition from primitive society to slave society, the Miao people were forced to retreat to the mountains in the southwest because of their resistance to the ruling monarch. At the end of the Yin and Shang dynasties, when the great slave owners ruled, the ancestors of the Tujia people, along with seven other ethnic groups in the southwest, participated in the battle to overthrow King Zhou. Although the two ethnic groups have been cruelly oppressed and exploited for thousands of years in the southwest region, making it difficult for them to develop normally, their artistic expression still reflects their unique cultural life and customs, whether it is song and dance or plastic arts, it is reflected exceptionally vividly. The Tujia people in western Hunan are good at weaving bed covers, and the Miao people are good at clothing embroidery. These artworks mostly belong to daily necessities, so they are closely related to love and friendship, and children's utensils are even more permeated with maternal love. Generally, they use local materials and ancient simple tools in their spare time after production and labor, and pass them on to each other based on memory, adding their personal wishes for life and their love of beauty to slowly complete them. Even under the extremely difficult living conditions before liberation, this production has always been able to maintain its high artistic level, and continue to have new works appear.
    After liberation, thanks to the great measures of the national ethnic policy, the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture was established five years ago, directly governing six counties and entrusting four counties, with a total population of more than 1.7 million. Over the past five years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the joint efforts of the people, the production and construction, culture and education of the ten counties of the Autonomous Prefecture have been advancing by leaps and bounds, with a completely new look. Because the Tujia ethnic group has been determined, in order to facilitate better unity among all ethnic groups and jointly strive to carry out the socialist construction of the motherland, it has recently been changed to the "Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture." This exhibition, with the works of the two ethnic groups accounting for the main part, is both a celebration of the establishment of the joint autonomous prefecture of the two ethnic groups, and a gift from the people of all ethnic groups in Hunan for the National Day, which is truly of profound significance! It is able to meet with the four million citizens of the capital, as well as thousands of model workers or cultural workers from all over the country, and foreign guests from all over the world, arousing attention from all parties. This kind of opportunity is only available in the new China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, where the people are truly the masters of the country.
    These works of art are not only the achievements of a few individuals in a province or a city, but also the common cultural heritage of the 600 million people of the motherland. Now, the good response from the audience in the capital will undoubtedly encourage the 1.7 million people in the Autonomous Prefecture to have greater work enthusiasm and better unity and friendship, and to bravely move forward towards socialism.

　　湖南的民间艺术
　　沈从文
    由中国美术家协会主持的湖南民间工艺美术展览会上的展品，共约出品四百件，大部分是由湖南省文化局、省手工业管理局共同征集来的。主要部分多属于湘西南土家、苗、瑶、侗、各兄弟民族创作，及各族同居地区汉人的创作。湘西土家族、苗族的编织物刺绣，种类特别丰富。编织物色彩鲜明，图案壮丽。挑花绣更风格独具，即以“穿花凤”主题绣而言，优秀健康的好花样，就有几十种，真可说美不胜收。每一种美术品，都交织着热烈弥厚的感情，给人一个清新愉快的印象。过去却极少为人知道。预展时，有位黄老先生说，“我是湖南人，活过六七十岁，就没有知道湖南还有这么多好东西！”其实它的产生存在已多年，正和劳动人民一切优秀品质一样，由于旧社会统治阶级从来不曾注过意，一般人自然是无法知道的。
    苗族和土家族，原是我们祖国民族大家庭里两位古老的成员；照历史叙述，原始社会进入奴隶社会时期，苗族因反抗统治君主才被迫退居西南山地。大奴隶主统治的殷商末期，土家族的祖先，又曾和西南其他七个民族参加过推翻纣王一役。两个民族居住西南地区，数千年来虽被残酷压迫剥削，难于正常发展，但在艺术表现上，还是各有其独特文化生活和风俗习惯，无论是歌舞还是造型艺术，都反映得格外鲜明。湘西土家族长于被面编织，苗族长于服装刺绣，这些艺术品多属于日常生活用品，因此和爱情友谊密切联系，小孩用物更浸透了一种母性爱情。一般多是在生产劳作余暇，利用当地现有材料，和古老简单工具，根据记忆彼此传授，加上个人对于生活的愿望，及爱美的情感，来慢慢完成的。即在解放前生活极端困苦的情形下，这门生产，仍始终还能保持它的高度艺术水平，和继续不断有新作品出现。
    解放后，由于国家民族政策的伟大措施，已于五年前即成立湘西苗族自治州，直辖六县，托管四县，共约人口百七十余万。五年来，在党的正确领导，人民共同努力下，自治州十县的生产建设，文化教育，无事不突飞猛进，面目一新。由于土家族已确定，为便于各族更好的团结，共同努力进行祖国社会主义的建设，最近又改为“土家族苗族自治州”。这次展出，两族人民作品既占主要部分，一面近于对两族联合自治州成立的庆祝，另一面也是湖南各族人民对于国庆的献礼，真是意义深长！它能够和首都四百万市民、及万千来自国内各地的模范或文化工作者，来自世界各国的外宾友人见面，引起各方面的重视，是只有在中国共产党领导，人民真正当家作主的新中国，才有这种机会的。
    这些艺术品不仅是一省一市少数个人的成就，其实还是祖国六亿人民的共同文化遗产。今在首都展出，从观众得到的良好反映，无疑还将鼓舞自治州百七十万人民更大的工作热情和更好的团结友爱，向社会主义奋勇前进。（附图片）
