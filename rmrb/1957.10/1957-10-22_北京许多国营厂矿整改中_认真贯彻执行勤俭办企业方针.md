(Xinhua News Agency report) Many state-owned factories and mines in Beijing are earnestly implementing the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily during the process of rectification and improvement.

Many enterprises, based on the phenomena of extravagance and waste exposed by the workers, are actively taking measures to correct them. Units such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory have reduced their management personnel by about 40% to 50% and have merged some management organizations. After streamlining the management organization, the Shijingshan Power Plant can save 140,000 yuan in wages and 6,000 tons of coal annually. The dormitories originally planned to be built, covering more than 1,600 square meters, can also be avoided. Some enterprises, based on the criticisms raised by the workers, have overcome waste in the utilization of existing facilities and in the use of raw materials and tools. In the past, the Beijing Railway Administration demolished and rebuilt many houses that should not have been overhauled, resulting in great waste. Recently, the Construction Department of the Bureau accepted the criticism of the workers and formed a working group composed of the chief engineer and others to conduct technical appraisal of each of the 184 houses reported by various units that were planned for major repairs next year. It was found that only 95 houses needed major repairs, while the rest did not need major repairs at all. This alone will save 270,000 yuan in major repair costs. According to the workers, the drill bits purchased by the North China Radio Equipment Factory in the past were enough for the entire factory to use for 40 years, resulting in a large backlog of funds. Now, three large trucks of these stockpiled materials have been sold to other factories, recovering more than 160,000 yuan in funds.

Many factories and mines have also solved some urgent problems based on the principle of spending less money and accomplishing more. In the past, the heat treatment workshop of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant lacked tools, and workers had to wear gloves to take workpieces out of the furnace, and their hands were often burned if they were not careful. During this rectification campaign, workers in the workshop, led by the workshop director, made more than a dozen fire hooks out of waste materials, solving the problem without spending a single penny.

### 北京许多国营厂矿整改中  认真贯彻执行勤俭办企业方针

    北京许多国营厂矿整改中
    认真贯彻执行勤俭办企业方针
    据新华社讯　北京市许多国营厂矿企业，在边整边改中认真贯彻勤俭办企业方针。
    许多企业根据职工们揭发出来的铺张浪费现象，积极采取措施加以纠正。石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂和国营北京第二棉纺织厂等单位，已将管理人员减少了40％到50％左右，并且合并了一些管理机构。石景山发电厂的管理机构经过紧缩以后，全年可以节约工资十四万元，节约煤六千吨。原来需要建设的一千六百多平方公尺的宿舍也可以不建设了。有些企业根据职工们提出的批评，克服了在利用原有设施以及在原材料和工具使用等方面的浪费现象。北京铁路管理局过去曾将许多不该大修的房屋拆掉重修，造成很大浪费。这个局的建筑处最近接受职工的批评，由总工程师等人组成工作组，对各单位报来的、计划在明年大修的一百八十四栋房屋，逐栋逐项进行技术鉴定，发现需要大修的仅九十五栋，其余根本不要大修。只这一项就能节省大修费二十七万元。华北无线电器材厂过去买的钻头，据职工们揭发可够全厂用四十年，积压了大量资金。现在，这批积压的器材已售给外厂三大卡车，收回资金十六万多元。
    许多厂矿企业还根据少花钱、多办事的原则，解决了一些迫切需要解决的问题。北京第一机床厂热处理车间，以前由于缺乏工具，工人带着手套从炉里往外拿工作物，一不小心手常常被烧伤。这次整风中，车间工人在车间主任带领下，用废料做了十几把火钩子，没有花一个钱解决了这个问题。
