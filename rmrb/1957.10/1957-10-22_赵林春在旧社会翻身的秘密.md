    The great debate on the new and old paths has been going on for several days in the 15th production team of the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Lanzhou. The vast majority of the cooperative members have spoken, and even some old women who were always afraid to speak in front of people stood up tremblingly, accusing the old society of their blood and tears life of "no mat on the kang, no skin on the face." Zhao Linchun, a well-to-do middle peasant who had always been dissatisfied with the agricultural cooperative, remained silent these days, listening carefully to other people's opinions with his head down. However, when the discussion on the comparison between the new and old societies was about to end, Zhao Linchun suddenly stood up and said: "Everyone says the old society was bad, but I turned the tables in the old society. In my grandfather's and my father's hands, there was not a single piece of land, and they lived a very poor life. I suffered for three years, married a wife, and finally worked hard to get four and a half *mu* of land, rising to become a well-to-do middle peasant. Everyone says the new society is good, but in my opinion, it is only good for poor peasants, and others don't get a share. I, Zhao Linchun, have not benefited from the agricultural cooperative, but have been burdened."

    Strange! How could this person be so stubbornly nostalgic for capitalism! Sun Wenchang, a lower-middle peasant, first retorted: "You say you turned the tables in the old society. We are all from the same village and cooperative, and everyone knows each other's background. Your grandfather mixed through his life by building *huji* (adobe bricks) and hauling short-term labor, and your father worked as a long-term laborer for landlord Zhang Tingxiang his entire life, not even returning home all year round. What was your family's situation at that time? During the disaster in the 18th year of the Republic of China, your twelve or thirteen-year-old second younger sister starved to death. You say you could turn the tables in the old society, how come your grandfather and father suffered their entire lives and didn't turn the tables? How exactly did you ‘turn the tables’? Everyone in this village knows. You stretch out wherever there is profit, and you drill wherever there is profit. You secretly mixed water and snow into a load of coal, plus some ash, turning it into two loads of coal to sell to others. You contracted *huji* in Lanzhou city, hiring seven or eight poor peasants to make them for you, taking profits from it, earning five yuan in the blink of an eye for every thousand *huji*. The money others borrowed from you increased from 100,000 yuan to 800,000 yuan in just over a year. Your fortune started from this root. When others settled their debts with you, some sold their houses, and some wrote their land in your name. Can these be considered legitimate labor income? Tell us, isn't the path you took in the past a capitalist road of ‘one family prospering while four neighbors fall into ruin’?"

    "You keep saying that you are burdened by joining the agricultural cooperative, and you have been trying to withdraw from the cooperative for half a year. Is it a burden on your life that has reduced your income, or is it a burden on your thinking because you want to take the capitalist road? We can calculate it." Production Team Leader Li Tianyan continued to question: "Last year's autumn harvest distribution, you threatened the cooperative by saying that you would withdraw and work on your own if you didn't get an income of 850 yuan. How much did you earn when you worked on your own? You can think about it. In 1955, when you worked on your own, how was your harvest, even if you worked yourself to death? According to you, your two *mu* and two *fen* of wheat and soybeans earned 252 yuan, half a *mu* of chili peppers and half a *mu* of Jintasi melon earned more than 370 yuan, plus millet, lentils, and vegetables, for a total of 857 yuan. It seems that your income is not small, but you still have expenses for seeds, fertilizers, public grain, and transportation. The fertilizer alone was 188 yuan, the public grain was 45 yuan, and other water conservancy, transportation, and miscellaneous items are not included. Just subtract these two items, and your income is only more than 600 yuan. But in the first year after joining the cooperative, you were still working in a careless manner, and your family worked 300 labor days, and the net income was more than 700 yuan. Compare them, which is more and which is less? Is it a question of ideology or a question of income?"

    When Zhao Linchun first heard others criticizing him, he was still unconvinced, muttering and trying to defend himself. However, the more he listened, the more he felt that he had fallen into a situation where he was at a loss for words, and finally he had to stand up and admit his mistakes: "I was wrong, I guarantee I won't do what everyone criticized me for again!"

    赵林春在旧社会翻身的秘密
    燕树桂
    新旧两条道路的大辩论，在兰州市郊区金星农业社第十五生产队上已进行了好几天了。全队绝大部分社员都已发了言，就连一些一向不敢在人面前讲话的老太太也颤巍巍的站起来，控诉着旧社会那种“炕上没席、脸上没皮”的血泪生活。一直对农业社不满的富裕中农赵林春，这几天却默不作声，只是搭拉着脑袋仔细听取别人的意见。但是，当大家对新旧社会对比问题讨论即将结束的时候，赵林春突然站起来说道：“旧社会大家都说不好，可是我是在旧社会翻身的。我爷爷手里，我爹手里，都是田无一块地无一片，过着很穷的光景。我苦了三年，苦了个媳妇，最后苦到四垧半地，上升成为一个富裕中农。新社会大家说好，依我看，只是好了贫农，别的人没有份。像我赵林春就在农业社没有得到什么好处，倒背了包袱。”
    奇怪！这个人怎么这样顽固地留恋资本主义！下中农孙文昌首先反驳道：“你说你是旧社会翻的身，咱们都是本村本社的，谁的底子大家都清楚。你爷爷给人打胡基（土胚）拉短工，混了一辈子，你爹给地主张廷祥拉了一辈子长工，一年四季连家都不回。当时你家的光景怎样？民国十八年遭灾，你十二三岁的二妹妹活活饿死了。你说旧社会你能翻身，怎么你爷你爹苦了一辈子没有翻过身来？你到底是怎么‘翻身’的？本庄人谁不知道。你是哪里有利就向哪里伸，哪里有利就向哪里钻。一驮煤背地里掺水掺雪，再加上一些灰，变成两驮煤卖给别人。你承包兰州城里的胡基，雇用七八个贫苦农民给你打，从中取利，一千个胡基转眼之间就赚五块钱。别人借你的钱，十万元不到一年多成为八十万元。你发家就从这个根子上发起来的。别人拉你的账，有的把房子卖了，有的把地写在你名下。这些难道能算正当的劳动收入吗？你说说你过去走的路，是不是‘发一家倒四邻’的资本主义道路？”
    “你口口声声说你参加了农业社是背了包袱，闹退社闹了半年。到底是生活上背了包袱减少了收入，还是思想上背了包袱想走资本主义道路？咱们可以算算。”生产队长李天彦接着质问道：“去年秋收分配，你说要没有八百五十元收入就要退社单干，这样威胁社。你单干时挣多少？你可以想想。1955年你单干，你挣死挣活的干，收成怎样呢？依你说：你那两垧二分小麦黄豆，收入是二百五十二元，半垧辣子半垧金塔寺瓜收入三百七十多元，再加上糜子扁豆菜蔬，总共是八百五十七元。看来你的收入不少，可是你还有籽种、肥料、公粮、运费等开支。单是肥料一项就是一百八十八元，公粮四十五元，其他水利、运费及各项杂项不计，就减去这两项，你的收入也不过六百多元。但是入社后第一年，你还是吊儿浪当的劳动着，全家作了三百个劳动日，净收入就是七百多元。你比比，哪个多哪个少？究竟是思想问题还是收入问题？”
    赵林春刚听到别人批评他，他还不服气，低声嘟囔着想起来辩解。但是，他越听下去，越感到自己已经陷入理屈词穷的境地，终于不得不站起来承认错误：“我错了，大家批评过的我保证不再做了！”
