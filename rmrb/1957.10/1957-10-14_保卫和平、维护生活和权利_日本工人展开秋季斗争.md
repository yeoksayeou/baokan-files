　　Defend Peace, Safeguard Livelihood and Rights
    Japanese Workers Launch Autumn Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: More than 120 locations across Japan today held "National Rallies to Defend Peace, Safeguard Livelihood and Rights." The rallies were jointly organized by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, neutral trade unions, and fifty organizations including farmers, women, students, peace groups, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party.
    The main objectives of the national rallies include reclaiming basic labor rights, striving for the implementation of a minimum wage system of 8,000 yen, and demanding a ban on nuclear weapons testing. The rallies also expressed support for the struggles of the Japan Iron and Steel Industry Workers' Union Federation, the All-Japan Express Workers' Union, and the All-Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union to increase wages.
    In Tokyo, over 40,000 people held central rallies this afternoon in Hibiya Park and the Sotobori Park in Yotsuya. A declaration passed at the rally expressed strong protest against the Nobusuke Kishi government. The declaration stated that the people of all strata in Japan, with the working class at the center, will strengthen unity and unification, strive to link the movement for peace with various forms of struggle of people from all walks of life, and resolutely fight to the end to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary government.
    The rally also passed resolutions opposing the Japanese government's suppression of the labor movement, opposing price increases, opposing turning Sunagawa and other places into U.S. military atomic warfare bases, demanding a ban on nuclear weapons testing, opposing the transportation of nuclear weapons into Japanese territory, and opposing the import of surplus U.S. agricultural products, among others.
    Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo, Communist Party Central Standing Committee member Hakamada Satomi, and others spoke at the rally.
    After the rally, all participants held demonstrations in the main streets of Tokyo.
    With the holding of rallies across the country today, the Japanese working class has officially begun a large-scale autumn struggle and year-end struggle.
    Following the 48-hour strike that began yesterday by workers at fourteen major steel companies, 59,000 shipbuilding workers at fifteen companies affiliated with the All-Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union, including Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Company, Mitsubishi Nippon Heavy Industries, Uraga Dock Company, and Hakodate Dock Company, also began their first 48-hour comprehensive strike this afternoon, demanding wage increases. The second strike by shipbuilding workers is scheduled to begin on October 17.
    The Japan Coal Miners' Union has already ordered workers at thirteen major coal mines last night to hold an indefinite strike.
    The All-Japan Express Workers' Union has already notified branches across the country yesterday, ordering them to strike from October 17. In addition, various unions belonging to the Japan Council of Government and Public Corporation Workers' Unions, such as the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union and the National Telecommunications Workers' Union, will also begin substantive struggles around October 14.
    From October 15 to 17, the autumn struggle led by "Sohyo" will enter its climax. If the Japanese government insists on suppressing the workers, the National Railway Workers' Union will also hold large-scale substantive struggles on October 15 and 16. The struggle of 350,000 railway workers is considered to have the greatest impact and may paralyze Japan's economy and industry.

　　保卫和平、维护生活和权利
    日本工人展开秋季斗争
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本全国一百二十多个地方今天分别举行了“保卫和平、维护生活和权利国民大会”。大会是由日本工会总评议会，中立工会，农民、妇女、学生、和平团体和社会党、共产党等五十个团体联合举行的。
    国民大会的主要内容有争回劳动基本权利，争取实行八千日元的最低工资制和要求禁止核武器试验等。大会还表示支援日本钢铁产业工会联合会、全日本通运公司工会和全日本造船工会要求提高工资的斗争。
    在东京，今天下午有四万多人分别在日比谷公园和四谷的外濠公园举行了中央大会。大会通过的一项宣言，对岸信介政府表示强烈抗议。宣言表示，以工人阶级为中心的日本各阶层人民将加强团结和统一，努力使争取和平的运动同各阶层人民的各种不同形式的斗争连结在一起，为打倒岸信介反动政府而坚决努力到底。
    大会还通过决议，反对日本政府镇压工人运动；反对提高物价；反对把砂川等地变成美军原子战争基地；要求禁止试验核武器；反对把核武器运进日本境内；反对输入美国剩余农产品等。
    社会党委员长铃木茂三郎、共产党中央常任干部会的裤田里见等在大会上讲了话。
    大会结束以后，全体与会者还在东京主要街道举行了示威游行。
    随着今天在全国各地的大会的举行，日本工人阶级正式开始了规模巨大的秋季斗争和年终斗争。
    紧接着大小十四家钢铁公司的工人昨天开始的四十八小时的罢工之后，全日本造船工会所属的三菱造船公司、三菱日本重工业公司、浦贺船坞公司和函馆船坞公司等十五家公司的五万九千名造船工人，也在今天下午开始了第一次四十八小时的全面罢工，要求增加工资。造船工人的第二次罢工预定从10月17日开始。
    日本煤矿工会已经在昨天晚上下令十三个主要煤矿的工人举行不定期限的罢工。
    全日本通运公司工会昨天已经通知全国各地的分会，命令它们从10月17日开始罢工。此外还有全递信从业员工会和全国电气通信工会等属于日本官公厅工会协议会的各个工会，也将从10月14日前后分别开始实力斗争。
    从10月15日到17日这几天，“总评”所领导的秋季斗争将进入高潮。假如日本政府坚持镇压工人，国营铁道工会也将在10月15日和16日举行大规模的实力斗争。三十五万铁道工人的斗争被认为是影响最大的，可能使日本的经济和工业陷于瘫痪。
