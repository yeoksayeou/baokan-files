Xinhua News Agency, October 13th—Beijing Municipal Government departments, Party and mass organizations, industry, construction, commerce, and institutions of higher learning are currently vigorously transferring staff to the countryside to participate in labor production. Almost every day, trucks loaded with transferred cadres are heading to the rural areas of the suburbs. According to responsible persons from relevant departments in Beijing, more than 7,000 cadres have already departed or are about to depart for the countryside, and together with the first batch of 3,600 who have already been transferred, the total number will reach more than 10,000.

At present, the vast majority of units in the city have formulated preliminary plans for transferring staff to participate in labor production. These plans embody a revolutionary spirit and generally call for extracting 30% to 50% of the existing personnel, with some reaching over 60%. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce’s plan stipulates that 54.8% of the cadres in the bureau will be transferred; the management personnel of the various companies under this bureau will be transferred at a rate of 65.7%. The city's construction system has decided to transfer 60% of its management personnel. The preliminary plan of the Renmin University of China has decided to transfer 38% of its staff and teaching personnel. Currently, the staff members who have been designated for transfer by various departments are being dispatched in batches, with the vast majority being sent to the countryside and a small portion to construction sites, state-owned farms, or handicraft production cooperatives. The construction and commercial systems and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions will soon dispatch more than 3,000 people to the rural areas around Beijing.

Many units have held enthusiastic discussions among their staff about why cadres should be transferred to participate in labor production. After discussions in each unit, a wave of enthusiastic applications to participate in physical labor has been stirred up among the staff. In the vast majority of units, after the leadership made a mobilization report on participating in labor production, more than 90% of the staff submitted applications to the leadership to participate in labor production. Some units posted large character posters expressing their determination to participate in labor production next to the large character posters criticizing the Rightists; on the desks of leading cadres, piles of applications, guarantees, and letters of determination have accumulated.

In the past few days, many units in Beijing have held farewell parties for the transferred cadres, sending them off to their glorious labor posts.

　　北京七千干部走上农业战线
    新华社13日讯　北京市政府机关、党群系统、工业、建筑业、商业以及高等学校等各个方面，目前正在大力抽调工作人员下放到农村去参加劳动生产。现在几乎每天都有满载下放干部的汽车驶向郊区农村。据北京市有关部门负责人谈，最近全市已出发和即将出发到农村去的干部有七千多人，连同第一批已经下放的三千六百人，总数将达一万多人。
    现在全市绝大多数单位已经制订了抽调工作人员参加劳动生产的初步方案，在方案中贯彻了革命的精神，一般都按照现有人数抽出干部30％到50％，有的高达60％以上。北京市商业局的方案规定在这个局抽调干部54.8％；这个局所属各公司的管理人员，抽调65.7％。全市建筑系统决定将管理人员抽调出60％。中国人民大学的初步方案决定抽调38％的工作人员和教学人员。现在，各部门已确定抽调的工作人员正陆续分批下放，其中绝大部分下放到农村，还有一小部分到工地、国营农场或手工业生产合作社。建筑、商业等系统和北京市工会联合会最近就将有三千多人出发到京郊农村。
    很多单位的工作人员对为什么要抽调干部参加劳动生产问题，展开了热烈讨论。各单位经过讨论后，在工作人员中掀起了踊跃报名参加体力劳动的热潮，绝大多数单位，在领导上作了关于参加劳动生产的动员报告以后，90％以上的工作人员向领导上提出了参加劳动生产的申请。有些单位在反击右派的大字报旁边又贴满了表示决心参加劳动生产的大字报；在领导干部的办公桌上，堆起了许多申请书、保证书和决心书。
    最近几天，北京市很多单位的工作人员为下放干部举行欢送会，欢送他们走向光荣的劳动岗位。
