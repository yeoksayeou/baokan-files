    Monopoly organizations manipulate music creation
    In recent years, American music creation has become increasingly sluggish due to the suppression of creative freedom by American television and radio monopoly organizations. The programs broadcast by television and radio companies are often bland and tasteless or obscene musical comedies.
    In June of this year, a report released by a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives revealed that the manipulation of music creation and the suppression of creative freedom by American monopoly organizations has reached a very serious level.
    Two important American television and radio networks, "Columbia Broadcasting System" and "Radio Corporation of America," directly control an organization specializing in broadcasting music - "Broadcast Music, Inc." In the first half of 1957, all of the so-called "Top Ten Songs" in the United States were produced by "Broadcast Music, Inc."
    "Broadcast Music, Inc." spares no effort to exert pressure on record program broadcasters and band conductors, requiring them to boycott works by composers and lyricists who do not belong to the company. Sometimes they openly bribe and buy off broadcasters and band conductors to act as salesmen for the company's songs.
    In order to strengthen their monopoly position, "Columbia Broadcasting System" and "Radio Corporation of America" also directly control several of the largest record companies. In this way, they invisibly manipulate the power of life and death over music creation. Because, in the United States, the popularity of musical works is extremely closely related to record production and broadcasting.
    The depression in American music creation caused by monopoly organizations manipulating television and radio music programs has already attracted the attention of the American public. According to the American "Worker's Daily," even Oscar Hammerstein, a member of the "American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers" and also the chairman of the so-called American "Dramatists Guild," openly stated: "The basic right to music creation has been deprived." "Now, even what music the American people should listen to and what music they should not listen to is being dictated by monopoly organizations." (Le Shan)

    垄断组织操纵下的音乐创作
    最近几年以来，由于美国电视、广播垄断组织扼杀创作自由，美国的音乐创作越来越不景气了。电视、广播公司播送的节目，经常是一些平淡无味的东西或是猥亵不堪的喜剧音乐。
    今年6月间，美国国会众议院一个小组委员会发表的调查报告，暴露出美国的垄断组织操纵音乐创作、扼杀创作自由的情况已经达到十分严重的程度。
    美国的两个重要的电视、广播网：“哥伦比亚广播公司”，“美国无线电公司”直接控制了一个专营广播音乐的组织——“广播音乐公司”。1957年上半年，美国所谓“十大名歌”，竟全部是“广播音乐公司”的出品。
    “广播音乐公司”不惜采用一切手段对唱片节目广播员、乐队的指挥施加压力，要求他们抵制不属于该公司的作曲家、歌词作者的作品。有时公然行贿、收买广播员、乐队指挥来为这个公司的歌曲作推销员。
    为了加强它们的垄断地位，“哥伦比亚广播公司”与“美国无线电公司”还直接掌握了几家最大的唱片公司。这样它们就无形操纵了音乐创作的生杀大权。因为，在美国，音乐作品的流行与灌制唱片及广播有着极其密切的关系。
    垄断组织操纵电视、广播音乐节目所造成的美国音乐创作的萧条，已经引起了美国公众的注意。据美国“工人日报”消息，连“美国作家、作曲家、出版者协会”会员兼所谓美国“剧作家联合会”主席职务的奥斯卡·哈默施太因也公开表示：“音乐创作的基本权利已经被剥夺了。”“现在连美国人民应该听什么音乐，不应该听什么音乐，也要由垄断组织来摆布了。”　　　（乐山）
