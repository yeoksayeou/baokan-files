    I Was Lenin's Guard
    Li Fuqing

    In November, the Ukrainian prairie was quite cold. Our partisan unit, led by the Bolsheviks, had been fighting in the Kiev and Kharkov areas for several months and had gradually grown to more than 10,000 people. One afternoon, we were stationed in a forest about seventy kilometers from Smolensk when suddenly the assembly call sounded again. We gathered quickly, and the captain seemed very excited, his voice particularly loud as he spoke. He said, "Comrades! Soviet power has been established, our revolution has succeeded, our workers and peasants have stood up, and we will no longer be oppressed by capitalists and landlords...." Immediately, shouts of "Long live the Soviets!" "Long live Lenin!" echoed through the forest that blocked out the sky.

    I was only nineteen years old at the time and didn't understand the principles of revolution. Hearing the captain's words, many questions arose in my mind. However, when I thought about my own experiences and pondered the captain's words, "We will no longer be oppressed by landlords and capitalists," I understood a little. A poor person like me, whose father was a carpenter unable to support the whole family, was tricked by the Tsar into being recruited as a Chinese worker from Shenyang to the Polish front, digging trenches and building fortifications for them, enduring great hardships. Later, under the call of a Russian comrade named Ivanov, we formed a partisan unit to strike at the Tsar's security forces and the reactionary armed forces of the landlords. The security forces called us "bandits," but unemployed workers and poor peasants flocked to our ranks. Recalling this experience, when the comrades cheered for the victory of the revolution, even though we were of different nationalities, how could my feelings not be as excited and happy as theirs!

    This happened in mid-November 1917, exactly forty years ago.

    Not long after, our partisan unit was officially reorganized into the Sixth Division of the First Army of the Red Army. Following the orders of the Revolutionary Military Committee, we continued to fight bitterly against the White Army in Kiev, Minsk, Kharkov, Luhansk, and other places.

    In early 1919, our troops selected more than two hundred commanders and soldiers to go to Petrograd. On the way, I thought we were going to fight, but when we arrived in Petrograd, the captain told us that we had the glorious task of guarding Lenin. Lenin, I had often heard comrades mention his name on the battlefield, but what kind of person was he really?

    From the day we started our guard duty, I and three Chinese comrades stood guard outside Lenin's office, under the steps. On the first day of guard duty, I saw a short man, wearing a dark blue old suit, hurrying into the office. I wondered, who is this? Could it be Lenin? Later, a Soviet comrade told me: that was Comrade Vladimir Ilyich himself.

    One day, the captain called me: "Vasily! You go and deliver the meal to Comrade Lenin!" I thought: such an important person as Lenin should eat better food. When I took a look at the food, there were a few slices of black bread, a plate of fried potatoes, and a bowl of vegetable soup. I was very surprised; Lenin's food was not much different from ours! I was deeply moved. Lenin, the great leader, how simple his life was!

    Once, some of us who were not on duty were gathered in the dormitory when suddenly a comrade standing at the door shouted, "Attention!" I looked up and saw Vladimir Ilyich coming.

    He nodded repeatedly, greeting us: "Comrades! Sit down!"

    He walked to each soldier's bed, touching the bedding, and then turned around and asked us: "How are you living? Is the room warm? Is the quilt a bit thin?"

    We replied, "Please rest assured, Comrade Lenin, our lives are much better than before."

    Ilyich, without waiting for us to finish, continued: "It is still difficult now, but the good days are ahead!" Lenin, how concerned he was about us soldiers! It is a pity that he has already left us and cannot see the golden days of a socialist country today.

    When Vladimir Ilyich was working, he sometimes went out for a walk. Once, he walked up to me and asked, "Are you a Chinese comrade?"

    "Yes, Comrade Lenin!" I replied.

    "Do you know Sun Yat-sen in China?"

    "I know."

    "Sun Yat-sen is leading the Chinese people to overthrow the Qing Dynasty emperor. One day, you will also be like us, defeating imperialism, capitalists, and landlords. At that time, you will become rich and strong." Vladimir Ilyich, fearing that I would not understand, gesticulated as he spoke. When he spoke of capitalists, he used his hands to imitate the pot-bellied appearance of a capitalist. Lenin, how concerned he was about the Chinese people and how concerned he was about the Chinese revolution!

    We stayed in Petrograd for more than a month and then followed Lenin to the Moscow Kremlin. That summer, the White Army Denikin launched a frenzied offensive against the Soviets on the Southern Front. By October, the White Army had occupied all of Ukraine, captured Oryol and Tula, and advanced directly on Moscow. At this time, Lenin issued the call, "Everyone go to fight Denikin." The comrades of our guard unit were transferred to the Southern Front, and I was assigned to the Thirty-third Regiment of the Sixth Division of the First Cavalry Army as a deputy reconnaissance squad leader. Before leaving the Kremlin, Lenin also gathered the comrades of the guard unit, gave a speech, and encouraged us to bravely kill the enemy and wipe out the White Army.

    After Denikin's bandit troops were wiped out, in April 1920, the Polish landlord reactionary armed forces invaded Ukraine and occupied Kiev. Our First Cavalry Army was transferred to Ukraine and drove the Polish bandit troops all the way to Warsaw. On the Polish front, once, our troops were surrounded by enemy forces, and the regimental commander ordered me to lead fourteen soldiers to reconnoiter the enemy's artillery positions. After reconnoitering, I walked towards the regimental headquarters and caught sight of our army commander Budyonny, division commander Timoshenko, and the regimental commander studying the enemy's situation together. I reported the reconnaissance to the regimental commander, and Comrade Budyonny asked the regimental commander: "Is he a Chinese comrade?"

    The regimental commander replied yes.

    Comrade Budyonny said: "He speaks fluent Russian."

    The regimental commander said: "He studies while fighting and can now even write."

    "You should study harder. With culture, it will be useful for building your country in the future." The army commander turned around and encouraged me. Even in the midst of intense fighting, General Budyonny was still concerned about a Chinese comrade, which truly moved me.

    Time flies so fast. It is the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution. What I have said above are all things that happened more than thirty years ago. In the past forty years, how much has the world changed! My second home, the Soviet Union, has healed the serious damage caused by Hitler's bandits and has become the strongest country. My motherland, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, has undergone more than twenty years of arduous struggle and finally cleared away the imperialist forces, defeated Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, and won complete liberation. In the eight years since liberation, the people of the whole country have been working wholeheartedly on construction, and our country has become a brand new and strong country. Although I am old, I am very happy to be able to see socialist society with my own eyes.

    In mid-May this year, I met Comrade S. N. Kazansky, the Soviet Consul General in Urumqi, in Urumqi. He told me that Chairman Voroshilov, Marshal Budyonny, and Marshal Timoshenko, who had led us in battles in the past, were all in good health. The cities and villages, large and small, such as Kiev, Minsk, Smolensk, and Sevastopol, where we once fought, have completely changed their appearance. If I have the opportunity to revisit these places, I would definitely find it difficult to recognize these towns.

    On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, in Xinjiang, far away from Moscow, I remotely wish the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union eternal strength and happiness. I remotely wish Chairman Voroshilov, Marshal Budyonny, and Marshal Timoshenko good health and longevity. (Illustration by Li Hu) (Attached picture)

    我当过列宁的卫士
    李富清
    11月里，乌克兰草原相当冷了。我们这支由布尔什维克领导的游击队，在基辅、哈尔科夫一带作战几个月，慢慢地壮大到一万多人了。一天下午，我们正驻扎在离斯摩棱斯克七十多公里的森林里，突然又吹起了集合的号音。我们马上聚集起来，队长显得很兴奋，讲话的时候声音也特别宏亮。他说：“同志们！苏维埃政权已经成立了，我们的革命成功了，我们工人和农民翻身了，再也不受资本家和地主的压迫了……。”顿时，“苏维埃万岁！”“列宁万岁！”的欢呼声，响彻了遮天蔽日的森林。
    那时我只有十九岁，还不懂得革命道理。听到队长这一番话，我脑子里掀起了许多问题。不过当我想起自己的遭遇，再仔细琢磨队长说的“我们再也不受地主和资本家压迫”这一句话时，我心里也明白几分了。像我这样一个穷人，父亲是木匠，养活不了全家，我才被沙皇借口招募中国工人从沈阳骗到波兰前线，给他们挖战壕，修工事，吃尽了苦头，后来在一位名叫伊凡诺夫的俄国同志号召下，组成了游击队，打击沙皇的保安队和地主反动武装，保安队叫我们做“土匪”，但失业的工人和穷苦的农民却涌到我们队伍里来。我回忆这段经历，当同志们欢呼革命胜利的时候，虽然我们国籍不同，我的心情怎能不和他们一样的激动和快乐呢！
    这是1917年11月中旬发生的事，距今已整整四十年了。
    隔不多久，我们游击队正式改编为红军第一军第六师。奉革命军事委员会的命令，继续在基辅、明斯克、哈尔科夫、诺汉斯克等地和白匪军辗转苦战。
    1919年初，我们部队选拔了二百多位指挥员和战士前往彼得格勒。在路上，我还以为去作战，谁知到了彼得格勒，队长才告诉我们担任保卫列宁的光荣任务了。列宁，我在战场上经常听到同志们提起他的名字，他到底是一位什么样的人呢？
    自从我们担任警卫工作那一天起，我和三位中国同志在列宁办公室外面的阶台下站岗。站岗的第一天，我见到一位身材不高的人，穿着深蓝色的旧西服，匆匆地走进办公室去了。我猜想，这是谁呢？难道是列宁吗？后来苏联同志告诉我：那正是弗拉基米尔·伊里奇同志。
    一天，队长来叫我：“华西里！你给列宁同志送饭去吧！”我想：像列宁这样重要的人，他吃的应该好一些。当我把饭菜接过来一瞧，几片黑面包，一盘炸洋芋，一盆菜汤。我非常惊奇，列宁吃的和我们并没有多少差别啊！我深受感动，列宁，伟大的导师，他的生活是多么朴素啊！
    一次，我们没有值班的同志正聚在宿舍里，忽然，听到站在门口的一位同志喊了一声：“敬礼！”我抬头一瞧，弗拉基米尔·伊里奇来了。
    他连连地点头，向我们招呼：“同志们！坐下！”
    他走到每一个战士的床前，摸摸垫的、盖的，又回过头来问我们：“生活得怎样？屋子暖吗？棉被是不是薄一点？”
    我们回答说：“请列宁同志放心，我们的生活比从前好得多了。”
    伊里奇没等我们说完，接着说：“现在还是艰苦的，好的日子在后头哩！”列宁，他是怎样地关心我们战士啊！可惜他早已离开了我们，不能亲眼见到今天社会主义国家黄金般的日子了。
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇办公的时候，有时出来散步，一次，他走到我跟前，问道：“你是中国同志吗？”
    “是，列宁同志！”我回答说。
    “你知道中国有位孙中山吗？”
    “知道。”
    “孙中山领导着中国人民推翻了清朝皇帝，总有一天，你们也要像我们一样，把帝国主义、资本家和地主打垮的，那时候，你们就会富强了。”弗拉基米尔·伊里奇唯恐我不能领会，说的时候，用手比划，说到资本家时，他用手比划资本家那副大腹便便的样子。列宁，他是怎样关心中国人民，又是怎样关心中国的革命事业呵！
    我们在彼得格勒住了一个多月，就随列宁到了莫斯科克里姆林宫。这年夏天，白匪军邓尼金在南方战线发动了对苏维埃的猖狂进攻；到10月间，白匪军占据了乌克兰全境，陷奥勒尔、土拉，直向莫斯科逼近。这时，列宁发出了“大家都去与邓尼金斗争”的号召，我们卫士队的同志调往南方前线，我被分配到骑兵一军六师三十三团担任侦察副班长，离开克里姆林宫以前，列宁还召集卫士队的同志，讲了话，勉励我们英勇杀敌，把白匪军消灭干净。
    邓尼金匪军肃清之后，1920年4月，波兰的地主反动武装进犯乌克兰，占领基辅。我们骑兵一军调到乌克兰，一直把波兰匪军赶到华沙。在波兰战线上，一次，我们的部队被敌军包围，团长命令我率领十四名战士去侦察敌军炮兵阵地。侦察回来，我走向团部，瞥见我们的军长布琼尼、师长提摩盛柯和团长在一块研究敌情。我向团长报告侦察经过，布琼尼同志问团长：“他是中国同志吗？”
    团长回答说是。
    布琼尼同志说：“说得一口流利的俄罗斯话。”
    团长说：“他一边作战，一边学习，现在还能写呢。”
    “应该加紧学习，有了文化，将来建设你们的国家会有用处的。”军长回头过来勉励我，在战斗紧张的时候，布琼尼将军还在关心一位中国同志，真让我感动。
    时间过得真快，十月革命四十周年了，以上所说的也都是三十多年前的事，四十年来，这个世界起了多大的变化！我的第二故乡——苏联已经医治好希特勒匪徒严重的破坏，成为最强盛的国家，我的祖国在共产党和毛主席领导下，经历了二十多年艰难战斗，终于扫清了帝国主义势力，打垮了蒋介石匪帮，获得了彻底的解放。解放后八个年头，全国人民万众一心地从事建设，我国已经成为一个崭新的强国，我年纪虽然老了，能够亲眼见到社会主义社会，我的心情非常快乐。
    今年5月中旬，我在乌鲁木齐会见了苏联驻乌鲁木齐总领事谢·尼·卡赞斯基同志，他告诉我曾经领着我们南征北战的伏罗希洛夫主席、布琼尼元帅、提摩盛柯元帅都很健康。三十多年前，我们曾经作过战的基辅、明斯克、斯摩棱斯克、塞瓦斯托波尔等大大小小的城市和乡村，外貌完全改变了，如果我有机会旧地重游，这些城镇我一定很难识别的。
    当此十月革命四十周年之际，我在远离莫斯科的新疆，遥祝以苏联为首的社会主义阵营永远强盛幸福。遥祝伏罗希洛夫主席、布琼尼元帅、提摩盛柯元帅健康长寿。（插图　李斛）（附图片）
