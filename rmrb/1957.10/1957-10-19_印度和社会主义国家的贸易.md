　　India's Trade with Socialist Countries
　　Wang Zhaoxun
    Before India's independence, its foreign trade was mainly with a small number of capitalist countries, the most important of which was Britain. During World War I, India's imports from Britain accounted for about 70% of India's total imports, and India's exports to Britain accounted for about 30% of India's total exports. Besides Britain, other major trading partners were Germany, Japan, and the United States. These capitalist countries not only used India as a source of raw materials and a sales market for industrial products, but also took advantage of their superior position to practice unequal exchange. Therefore, India suffered huge losses in its trade with these countries.
    After independence, India's foreign trade policy was to develop trade relations with all countries in the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Therefore, in recent years, in addition to continuing trade with capitalist countries, India has also seen rapid development in its trade relations with socialist countries. The Indian government has signed trade agreements with almost all socialist countries, and socialist countries have successively established commercial institutions in India's capital and major commercial cities. For example, the Soviet Union has established trade representative offices in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata; Czechoslovakia has established trade representative offices in New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Madras; Poland, Romania, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia have established trade representative offices in New Delhi and Mumbai; in addition to sending a commercial counselor to New Delhi, China has also established commercial agencies in Kolkata and Kalimpong. In terms of shipping, India has signed shipping agreements with the Soviet Union and Poland, stipulating that India and the Soviet Union will each arrange six ocean-going vessels with a total tonnage of 55,000 tons, and India and Poland will each arrange three vessels, to regularly sail between Indian, Soviet, and Polish ports, evenly distribute cargo, stipulate reasonable freight rates, give each other the most favorable treatment and convenience to each other's ships, and send representatives to regularly discuss related issues. With the signing of trade agreements and shipping agreements, and the establishment of trade institutions, the trade volume between India and socialist countries has increased significantly.
    Developing trade relations with socialist countries is beneficial to India. This is reflected in:
    First, it reduces India's economic dependence on a small number of capitalist countries. Capitalist countries, in their trade with India, not only seek to obtain maximum profits, but also want to control India economically. Conversely, socialist countries trade with India on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and they also help India develop its national industry as much as possible. Therefore, when developing trade relations with socialist countries, India's economic dependence on capitalist countries is reduced.
    Second, India has fully obtained the supply of materials for developing its national industry. In order to develop its national industry, India needs to import a large amount of machinery and industrial equipment, but in 1951-1952, the value of machinery imported by India accounted for only 12% of India's total imports, and most of them were light industrial machinery such as textile machinery and sugar-making machinery. India did not import a large amount of machinery because capitalist countries were unwilling to supply it in large quantities. Capitalist countries supplied India with a large amount of consumer goods and "surplus" agricultural products, and the import of these commodities seriously hit India's industry and agriculture.
    Contrary to capitalist countries, the Soviet Union supplies India with complete sets of equipment for steel plants with an annual output of 1.3 million tons of steel, aluminum smelting plants, power plants, pharmaceutical factories, etc., as well as metallurgical mining machinery, transportation equipment, and chemical industrial equipment; in addition, the Soviet Union has agreed to supply India with one million tons of steel in the three years starting from 1956. Czechoslovakia supplies India with complete sets of equipment for cement plants, sugar factories, power plants, forging and pressing factories, machine tool factories, glass factories, and aluminum smelting plants. Romania supplies India with agricultural machinery and oil drilling equipment. East Germany supplies India with complete sets of equipment for optical instruments, transportation equipment, precision machinery, sugar making, and brown coal mining. Poland and Yugoslavia supply India with equipment for building docks and shipbuilding. China has also supplied India with some machinery, steel, chemical raw materials, etc. India is currently implementing its second five-year plan, which mainly develops heavy industry and needs to import a larger amount of industrial equipment. If these materials all rely on capitalist countries for supply, it will be difficult to complete the plan; now they can be imported from socialist countries, and India no longer worries about any difficulties in the supply of these materials.
    When socialist countries supply India with industrial equipment, they also provide technical assistance. The Soviet Union helped India build a steel plant, sending 300 experts to India and accepting 300 Indian technicians to study in the Soviet Union; Czechoslovakia helped India build a cement plant, sending experts to India to train technicians.
    Third, India's export commodities have found new markets. In the past, capitalist countries often adopted the method of suspending or delaying purchases to depress the prices of India's export commodities. At that time, India had no other buyers, so it had to reluctantly sell its export commodities at reduced prices. Now that India has developed trade relations with socialist countries, it is no longer afraid that capitalist countries will adopt the method of suspending or delaying purchases to depress the prices of its export commodities.
    In order to implement the second five-year plan, India's import value has increased a lot, but the export value cannot increase accordingly, resulting in a large trade deficit. Although the Indian government has taken many measures, such as exempting or reducing export taxes on certain commodities, relaxing export quotas on certain commodities, and establishing export promotion committees for certain commodities to encourage exports, the effect is not great. This is because the capitalist market is sluggish and competition is fierce, and it is very difficult to increase exports substantially. However, the economies of socialist countries continue to develop, and the living standards of the people continue to improve, and the quantity of imports needed is very large. The possibility of India increasing its exports to socialist countries is also very high.
    Fourth, India has improved its foreign exchange balance. The principle of foreign trade in socialist countries is to basically balance imports and exports. Trading with socialist countries helps India improve its foreign exchange balance. At present, the payment agreements signed between socialist countries and India also stipulate that the Indian rupee will be used as a means of payment. This provision is of great benefit to India. In addition, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany are negotiating with India to supply equipment on the basis of long-term loans.
    Developing trade relations with India is also beneficial to socialist countries. India is a country with a vast territory and a large population. In recent years, it has played a great role in the struggle for peace. If it completely gets rid of its economic dependence on capitalist countries and rapidly industrializes, then the forces of world peace will be even stronger.
    India is a country with very rich resources. It exports a large amount of oilseeds, iron sand, leather, tea, textiles, etc. In order to supply raw materials to the increasingly developing industry and meet the needs of the people's ever-improving living standards, socialist countries need India's traditional export commodities.
    Undeniably, the proportion of trade volume between India and socialist countries in India's total foreign trade is still very small, and there are objective reasons for this. Capitalist countries hinder India from developing trade relations with socialist countries. They threaten Indian merchants that if they trade with socialist countries, they will no longer buy their goods and supply them with goods. These Indian merchants have a long-standing commercial relationship with capitalist countries, and they have concerns under this threat. At the same time, capitalist countries also frequently send trade delegations to visit India, and many commercial firms also send a large number of personnel to stay in India to engage in activities. Many shipping companies, insurance companies, and banks operating foreign exchange business are controlled by merchants in capitalist countries, which also allows capitalist countries to continue to maintain their advantage in India's trade.
    However, since developing trade relations between India and socialist countries is beneficial to both sides, this trade relationship cannot be completely blocked by external forces. At present, both the Indian government and the governments of socialist countries are developing trade with each other in a planned and step-by-step manner. The foreign trade of socialist countries is state-owned, and the governments of these countries have already managed to develop trade with India in a planned and step-by-step manner; in 1956, India also established a National Trade Corporation, which assigned several major import and export commodities to this company for operation. The main target of this company's trade is socialist countries. This shows that the Indian government has also begun to develop trade with socialist countries in a planned and step-by-step manner. At the same time, India and socialist countries also frequently send government officials and trade delegations to visit each other to understand each other's supply and demand situations, which has also played a good role in promoting economic and trade relations.
    The commodity exhibitions held between India and socialist countries are of great significance for enhancing mutual understanding of supply and demand. In 1952, India held an international industrial exhibition in Mumbai, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and China participated; in 1955, more socialist countries participated in the international industrial exhibition held by India in New Delhi. In the two industrial exhibitions, the socialist countries' pavilions were the largest in scale, had the most visitors, and received the best feedback. In 1952, in Mumbai, the Chinese pavilion had 1.5 million visitors; in 1955, in New Delhi, the Chinese pavilion had 3 million visitors. The Indian government has also held exhibitions in many socialist countries. The exhibition held by India in our country's capital this time is large in scale and has many exhibits. India is our country's friendly neighbor, and its exhibition of exquisite industrial products and handicrafts in our country has been warmly welcomed by our people. We firmly believe that after this exhibition, the trade relations between China and India will have further development.
    In short, trade between India and socialist countries has broad prospects, and developing this trade relationship is beneficial to both India and socialist countries, and it is also helpful to safeguarding world peace.

### 印度和社会主义国家的贸易

　　印度和社会主义国家的贸易
　　王兆勋
    印度独立以前，对外贸易的主要对象是少数资本主义国家，其中最主要的是英国。第一次世界大战时，印度从英国的进口值约占印度进口总值的70％，印度向英国的出口值约占印度出口总值的30％。除了英国以外，其他主要贸易对象是德国、日本和美国。这些资本主义国家不仅把印度作为它们的原料的供应地和工业品的销售市场，而且利用它们的优越地位实行不等价的交换，因此，印度和这些国家进行贸易是遭受巨大的损失的。
    独立以后，印度的对外贸易政策是在平等互利的基础上，和世界上一切国家发展贸易关系。因此，近几年来，印度除了继续和资本主义国家进行贸易外，和社会主义国家的贸易关系也有迅速的发展。印度政府已经差不多和所有的社会主义国家政府签订了贸易协定，社会主义国家也已经先后在印度的首都和各大商业城市设立了商务机构。例如，苏联在新德里、孟买和加尔各答设立了商务代表处；捷克斯洛伐克在新德里、孟买、加尔各答和马德拉斯设立了商务代表处；波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、民主德国、保加利亚和南斯拉夫在新德里和孟买设立了商务代表处；我国除了在新德里派驻商务参赞外，还在加尔各答和噶伦堡设立了商务代理处。在航运方面，印度和苏联、波兰先后签订了航运协定，规定印苏双方各安排共五万五千吨位的六条海洋航轮，印、波各安排三条，定期航行印、苏和印、波口岸间，平均分配货儎，规定合理运费，互相给予对方船只以最优惠待遇和方便，互派代表定期协商有关问题。随着贸易协定和航运协定的签订，贸易机构的建立，印度和社会主义国家的贸易额有了显著的增加。
    和社会主义国家发展贸易关系对印度是有利的。这表现在：
    第一，减轻了印度在经济上对少数资本主义国家的依赖。资本主义国家和印度进行贸易，不仅要获取最大限度的利润，而且要在经济上控制印度。相反地，社会主义国家是在平等互利的基础上和印度进行贸易的，它们还尽可能地帮助印度发展民族工业。因此，和社会主义国家发展贸易关系时，印度在经济上对资本主义国家的依赖性就减轻了。
    第二，印度充分地得到了发展民族工业的物资的供应。为了发展民族工业，印度需要进口大量的机器和工业设备，但是1951—1952年度印度进口的机器的价值只占印度进口总值的12％，其中绝大部分是轻工业的机器如纺织机器、制糖机器等。印度没有大量进口机器是因为资本主义国家不愿意大量供应。资本主义国家大量供应印度的是消费品和“剩余”农产品，输入这些商品严重地打击了印度的工业和农业。
    和资本主义国家相反，苏联供应印度的是年产一百三十万吨钢材的炼钢厂、炼铝工厂、发电厂、制药厂等成套设备、冶金采矿机器、交通运输工具、化学工业器材等；此外，苏联还同意在从1956年开始以后三年内供应印度一百万吨钢材。捷克斯洛伐克供应印度的是水泥厂、制糖厂、发电厂、锻压工厂、工作母机厂、玻璃厂、炼铝工厂等成套设备。罗马尼亚供应印度的是农业机器和石油钻探设备等。民主德国供应印度的是光学仪器、运输工具、精确机械、制糖和开采褐煤等成套设备。波兰和南斯拉夫供应印度的是建筑码头、造船等设备。我国也供应了印度某些机器、钢材、化工原料等。目前印度正在实行主要是发展重工业的第二个五年计划，需要进口更多数量的工业设备，如果这些物资都靠资本主义国家供应，那是很难完成计划的；现在可以从社会主义国家进口，印度不再忧愁这些物资的供应会发生什么困难了。
    社会主义国家供应印度工业设备时，也给予技术援助。苏联帮助印度建立炼钢厂，派遣了三百个专家前往印度，并且接受了三百个印度技术人员前往苏联学习；捷克斯洛伐克帮助印度建立水泥厂，派遣了专家前往印度训练技术人员。
    第三，印度的出口商品找到了新的市场。过去资本主义国家经常采取停购或者缓购的办法来压低印度出口商品的价格，那时候印度因为没有其他买主，只好忍痛把出口商品压价出售。现在印度发展了和社会主义国家的贸易关系，不再害怕资本主义国家采取停购或者缓购的办法来压低它的出口商品的价格了。
    为了实行第二个五年计划，印度进口值增加很多，而出口值却不能相应地增加，入超很大。印度政府虽然采取了很多办法，如免除或者减低某些商品的出口税，放宽某些商品的出口限额，成立某些商品的出口促进委员会等来鼓励出口，收效却不大。这是因为资本主义市场不景气，竞争很激烈，大量增加出口是很困难的。但是社会主义国家的经济继续在发展，人民的生活水平继续在提高，需要进口的数量是很大的，印度向社会主义国家增加输出的可能性也是很大的。
    第四，印度改善了外汇收支的情况。社会主义国家对外贸易的原则是进出口基本平衡，和社会主义国家进行贸易，有助于印度改善外汇收支情况。目前社会主义国家和印度签订的支付协定还规定用印度卢比作为支付手段。这种规定对印度是有很大的好处的。此外，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和民主德国正在和印度谈判在长期贷款的基础上供应设备。
    和印度发展贸易关系对社会主义国家也是有利的。印度是一个土地辽阔、人口众多的国家，这几年来它在争取和平的斗争中起了很大的作用，如果它在经济上完全摆脱了对资本主义国家的依赖，而且迅速地工业化，那末，世界和平的力量将更加强大。
    印度是一个资源非常丰富的国家，它输出大量的油籽油料、铁砂、皮革、茶叶、纺织品等。为了供应日益发展的工业以原料和满足人民日益提高的生活水平的需求，社会主义国家是需要印度的传统出口商品的。
    勿庸讳言，目前印度和社会主义国家的贸易额在印度对外贸易总额中所占的比重还是很小的，这是有客观的原因的。资本主义国家阻挠印度和社会主义国家发展贸易关系，它们威胁印度商人说，如果他们和社会主义国家进行贸易，它们将不再购买他们的商品和对他们供应商品。这些印度商人和资本主义国家有了悠久的商业关系，在这种威胁下，他们有所顾虑。同时，资本主义国家还经常派遣贸易代表团访问印度，许多商行还派遣大批人员留驻印度活动，不少航运公司、保险公司和经营外汇业务的银行操在资本主义国家的商人的手里，这也使资本主义国家对印度的贸易继续保持优势。
    但是，发展印度和社会主义国家之间的贸易关系，既然对双方都是有利的，那末，这种贸易关系不是外力所能完全阻挡的。现在，印度政府和社会主义国家政府都在有计划、有步骤地发展同对方的贸易。社会主义国家的对外贸易是国营的，这些国家政府已经做到了有计划、有步骤地发展同印度的贸易；1956年印度也设立了国家贸易公司，把几种主要进出口商品划归这个公司经营。这个公司进行贸易的主要对象是社会主义国家。这说明了，印度政府也已经开始有计划、有步骤地发展同社会主义国家的贸易。同时，印度和社会主义国家还经常派遣政府官员和贸易代表团相互访问，了解彼此的供需情况，对促进经济和贸易关系也起了良好的作用。
    印度和社会主义国家间所相互举办的商品展览会，对增进彼此间在供需方面的了解有着重要的意义。1952年印度在孟买举办国际工业展览会，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利和我国都参加了；1955年印度在新德里举办的国际工业展览会，有更多的社会主义国家参加。在两次工业展览会中，规模最大，观众最多，反映最好的是社会主义国家的展览馆。1952年在孟买，我国展览馆的观众达一百五十万人；1955年在新德里，我国展览馆的观众达三百万人。印度政府也在许多社会主义国家举办过展览会。这次印度在我国首都举办的展览会规模很大，展品很多。印度是我国的友好邻邦，它在我国举办展览会，展出精美的工业制品和手工艺品，受到了我国人民的热烈欢迎。我们深信这次展出以后，中、印两国的贸易关系会有更进一步的发展。
    总之，印度和社会主义国家的贸易是有广阔的前途的，而发展这种贸易关系对印度和社会主义国家都是有利的，对保障世界和平也是有帮助的。
