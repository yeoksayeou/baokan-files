    Remembrance
    Li Jiye

    We met on a tram in Moscow, twenty-two years ago now.
    We didn't know each other's names, but the impression is as fresh as yesterday.
    A kind old woman, a baby just over a year old,
    Rosy cheeks pressed against the grandmother's face,
    Bright, round eyes watched me, fascinated.
    I gazed intently at his smiling face,
    Gently touching his little face with my finger,
    I coaxed him to laugh, and he wasn't afraid of me at all,
    As if sensing that my heart had become his cradle.
    The old woman seemed like a close relative of mine,
    She let me kiss her grandson's rosy cheeks.
    Parents who have kissed their own firstborn infant
    Can understand my joyful feelings!
    For many years this nameless longing
    Could only be sent to the distant land with the starlight;
    Sometimes walking by the water on a moonlit night,
    I couldn't help but gaze wistfully towards Russia!
    Our countries have become a harmonious family,
    And we are even closer than relatives.
    I revisited Moscow but we didn't meet again,
    But we will always be heart to heart!

    忆念
    李霁野我们在莫斯科电车上相见，离现在已经有二十二年。我们彼此并不知道姓名，印象却像昨天的事一样新鲜。一位慈祥的老妇人，一个不过周岁的幼婴，红红的腮贴着祖母的脸，圆亮的小眼看得我出神。我凝神注视着他的笑靥，伸出指头轻抚他的小脸，我逗他笑他一点也不怕生，仿佛觉到我的心已成他的摇篮。老妇人好像是我的近亲，她让我在孙儿的红腮上接吻。吻过自己的头生婴儿的父母都可以心会我的欢快心情！多年来这无名的怀想，只能凭星光遥寄远方；有时月夜在水滨散步，我不禁向俄罗斯怅望！我们的祖国联成和睦家庭，我们更是亲上加亲。再访莫斯科并未相遇，可是我们永远心心相印！
