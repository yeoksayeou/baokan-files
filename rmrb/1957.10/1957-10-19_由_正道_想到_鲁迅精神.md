　　From "The Right Path" to "The Spirit of Lu Xun"
　　Ge De
    The People's Daily has already published an editorial on "Dictatorship Must Be Exercised Over Bad Elements." On the 15th, news of the suppression of bad elements in Beijing was published. In one sentencing, seven people were sentenced to death, and according to the person who announced the sentence, four others had already been executed according to the law.
    If someone were to ask in the tone of Kong Yiji, "Is it many?" we might as well answer, "Not many!" What determines the number should not be the size of the number, but the truthfulness of the crimes. Saying it's not many is based on the published crimes, each of which deserves to die. Even killing a thousand more of such people would not be too many. The matter of killing people cannot be judged as heroic based on quantity, but can be judged as right or wrong based on whether it benefits the people. As long as the killing is just, it can be done with confidence. In the past, the Kuomintang killed revolutionaries, and even if they only killed one, it was too much, it was evil.
    Some may say that this argument does not conform to the principle of forgiveness and is greatly inhumane. The answer is: although it does not enter the path of forgiveness, it avoids straying from the right path; it is the right path. And it is great benevolence. If one believes that using resolute and severe measures to eliminate the abuse and killing of infants and innocent people is inhumane, then facing the bloody corpses of infants and preaching forgiveness to murderers, is that truly great benevolence?
    If someone asks: Does this not violate our consistently emphasized spirit of persuasion and education? The answer is: No! We must still adhere to persuasion and education; but only for the people. For bad elements who have already become objects of dictatorship, fists are more persuasive than mouths. Moreover, those sentenced to death are only a minority of the counter-revolutionaries and bad elements who have been apprehended.
    A farmer once told me about his experience in reforming dogs. There was a dog that stole food and repeatedly refused to change its ways. After it stole something once, the farmer tied it next to the stove and beat it severely. After the beating, he put food on the stove, and it went to eat again; he beat it again. After repeated beatings, the dog never dared to steal food again. I believe this is true, because I have heard similar experiences; moreover, it also conforms to Pavlov's theory of conditioned reflexes.
    Even the nature of a dog can be changed, let alone human nature. But to reform the human nature of bad elements, it is necessary to first give them resolute suppression, so that they know what to fear and what the consequences are. Because even the appalling bloody corpses of young girls cannot move them even a little, where else in the world can one find the golden mouth that can make stubborn stones nod?
    Perhaps it is because the anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun is approaching that I thought of Mr. Lu Xun's admonition. He was against practicing "forgiveness" towards all those who harm the people. When discussing beating drowning dogs, he was pained by the fact that many people were confused by forgiveness and fell into straying from the right path, and he loudly urged people to offer his loyal advice: do not be soft on those who harm people. Until his death, he never abandoned this admonition, and in his will regarding "death," there was the awe-inspiring maxim "I will not forgive a single one." This refers to anyone who harms the people. Now, he has been gone for twenty-one years, but when I recall his words, it is as if he is still gazing intently at the present world.
    What I think of from this is not just Mr. Lu Xun's one admonition. But it is the spirit of Lu Xun that is discerned from this admonition.
    In the years when the Kuomintang executioners were ferociously strangling revolutionaries, encircling and suppressing revolutionary culture, Mr. Lu Xun foresaw that the people would eventually gain power, and those who harmed the people would inevitably become drowning dogs. This was great wisdom; daring to declare war on the evil dogs who were in power while surrounded, and clearly pointing out that after they fell into the water, they should still be beaten, this was great courage; being able to strip away all the masks of the dogs between raising his hands when people were indulging in the poison of forgiveness, freeing people from straying from the right path, and turning people to the right path. This was great talent. But Mr. Lu Xun had great wisdom, great courage, and great talent, because he had great benevolence and great virtue in loving the people, being loyal to the people, and serving the people with all his might. Without this great virtue, I am afraid it would be difficult to generate this great wisdom, great courage, and great talent, and even if it did germinate, it would return to extinction. At that time, I am afraid there would be no one like Mr. Lu Xun to raise such a question in such a way.
    What we should learn is precisely Mr. Lu Xun's noble spirit of the "right path." Today, some villains who falsely claim to be followers of Lu Xun, remove Mr. Lu Xun's virtue of loyalty to the people from the spirit of Lu Xun, and only absolutize "anti-status quo," wantonly rebelling against everything by trampling on the interests of the people. This is actually a castration of the spirit of Lu Xun, a betrayal of the spirit of Lu Xun, and a false accusation against the dead. Today, are not these "anti-status quo" villains the ones who are clamoring for forgiveness for all bad elements, counter-revolutionaries, and saboteurs, and opposing the resolute suppression of them? If we listen to this group of rogues, how can we comfort Mr. Lu Xun's heroic spirit in the underworld!
    To learn and promote the spirit of Lu Xun, we must wholeheartedly support the resolute suppression of all those who harm the people. Long live the people's democratic dictatorship! It is also long live the spirit of Lu Xun! Those who love Lu Xun will understand this. And this is also the best memorial to Mr. Lu Xun.

### 由“正道”想到“鲁迅精神”

　　由“正道”想到“鲁迅精神”
　　葛德
    人民日报早已发表过“对坏分子必须实行专政”的社论。15日，又刊布了北京镇压坏分子的消息。一次宣判处极刑的就有七人，据宣判的人说，还有四个已被分别依法处死了。
    倘有人学孔乙己的语调来发问：“多乎哉”？我们也不妨回答：“不多也”！决定这多少的不应是数目的大小，而是罪行的实妄。说不多，是从公布的罪行看，个个都死有余辜。这样的人再杀一千也不多。杀人的事，虽不能以多少论英雄，但可以是否有利于人民来论正邪。只要杀得正，就可理直气壮的杀。过去国民党的杀革命者，即使只杀一个，也是多了，邪了。
    有人会说此论不合于恕道，大不仁。答曰：虽不入恕道，却也避开了枉道；是正道。而且是大仁。倘认为用坚决严厉的手段，力求消除对于幼儿和无辜者的虐杀，是不仁；那末，面对着血淋淋的幼儿尸体，向杀人犯讲恕道，难道倒是大仁？
    倘有人问：这不违背我们一贯强调的说服教育精神吗？回答是：并不！我们还是要坚持说服教育的；但只是对人民。对于已经成为专政对象的坏分子，拳头比嘴巴更有说服力。何况处以死刑的又只是已破获的反革命分子和坏分子中的少数呢。
    有一个农民对我谈过他改造狗的经验。有一只偷吃的狗，屡戒不改。在一次偷吃了东西以后，这位农民就把它拴在锅台旁痛打。打后，把食物放在锅台上，它又去吃；再打，经过连续地几次痛打，这只狗便再不敢偷吃东西了。我相信这是真的，因为类似的经验还听说过一些；而且，这也还合乎巴甫洛夫的条件反射学说。
    狗性尚且能改，何况人性。但要改造坏分子的人性，必先予以坚决的镇压，使之知所畏惧而后果。因为连惨不忍睹的血淋淋的幼女尸体，都不能使他们动心于万一，世上还能从哪里找到使顽石点头的金口呢？
    大概是临近了鲁迅先生纪念日的缘故，便由此想到了鲁迅先生的忠告。他是反对对一切残害人民的人实行“恕道”的。他在论到打落水狗的时候，就曾因痛心许多人惑于恕道而陷入枉道，大声疾呼地向人们提出忠告：对害人者不能手软。一直到死，他从未放弃过这种忠告，在他关于“死”的遗嘱中，就有着“我也一个都不宽恕”的大义凛然的警句。这便是指的任何害人民的人。如今，他已离开我们整整二十一年，但回味起他的话来，好像他仍然目光炯炯地督察着现世。
    由此所想到的，决不止鲁迅先生的这一忠告。而是由这一忠告所体察出的鲁迅精神。
    在国民党刽子手凶狂绞杀革命者，围剿和扼杀革命文化的年代里，鲁迅先生预见到人民终必得势，而残民者必将沦为落水狗，是一种大智；敢于在包围之中，向正在得势的恶狗们宣战，而且明白指出当它们落水以后还要从而打之，这是大勇；能从人们耽迷于恕道的流毒时，举手之间，剥尽一切狗们的假面，脱人于枉道，转人于正道。这是大才。但是鲁迅先生有大智、大勇、大才，又是因为他具有热爱人民，忠于人民和尽全力为人民服务的大仁和大德。倘无这大德，怕就难生这大智大勇大才，即是萌生也复将归于泯灭。那时怕也就没有鲁迅先生这样的人来这样的提出这样的问题了。
    我们应当学习的，正是鲁迅先生这种崇高的“正道”精神。今天，有些假名鲁迅信徒的恶棍，从鲁迅精神中剔除先生忠于人民的美德，而只把“反现状”加以绝对化，践踏着人民利益来乱反一通，这其实是对鲁迅精神的阉割，是鲁迅精神的叛逆，是对死者的栽诬。今天，口口声声要求对一切坏分子、反革命、破坏者实行恕道，反对坚决镇压他们的，不又正是这帮“反现状”的恶汉？听信了这班无赖，将如何慰先生的英灵于地下！
    学习和发扬鲁迅精神，就必须全心拥护对一切残民者的坚决镇压。高呼人民民主专政万岁！也就是高呼鲁迅精神万岁！爱鲁迅者，都会明白这一点的。而这也正是对鲁迅先生的最好纪念。
