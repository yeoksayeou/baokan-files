Report from our newspaper: A crucial issue for agricultural production cooperatives after increasing production and income is whether they expand public accumulation and pay attention to saving and reserves. This is of great importance for rapidly improving production levels and consolidating and enhancing agricultural cooperatives. The situation in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, proves this point.

Handan Prefecture currently has 3,607 agricultural cooperatives. Due to increased production, the actual income of cooperative members has greatly increased. It is estimated that this year, in the plains areas, 693 cooperatives will have an average income of 80 to 180 yuan per person, and in the mountainous areas, 146 cooperatives will have an average income of 50 to 100 yuan per person. The actual income of the members of these cooperatives has reached or exceeded the relatively high living standards of local farmers before cooperativization.

However, since last year, new problems have emerged in some agricultural cooperatives that have increased production and income, with a rather serious neglect of public accumulation and expanded reproduction. For example, after the Xinan Zhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Feixiang County increased production last year, it distributed most of the grain money to its members. The 101 households in the cooperative built more than 90 new houses and bought 20 bicycles. However, the agricultural cooperative could not raise funds for this year's production investment and had to sell two mules. Last year, the members of the Huoshui Jiao Agricultural Cooperative in Shexian County's mountainous area increased their average actual income to 130 yuan per person. However, the cooperative not only did not retain this year's production investment, but also took 2,000 yuan from state loans and distributed it to the members. As a result, many difficulties arose in production this year, and the income of the members was reduced, with an estimated distribution of only 67 yuan per person. Among some members, there has also been a growth of the phenomenon of not saving when production increases, not making reserves when income increases, and being neither diligent nor frugal. For example, the Rongsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Zhuchang Township, Wu'an County, with 1,050 households, had an average income of 114 yuan per person last year. In one year, the members built 191 tombs; some people in their thirties even built tombs for themselves in advance. However, the public welfare fund retained by the cooperative last year accounted for only 3.6% of the total income. Apart from solving the livelihood of the "five guarantees" households and the price of the members' means of production, they were unable to solve the investment problem of expanding reproduction on their own.

In contrast to the above situation, some agricultural cooperatives have promptly paid attention to expanding public accumulation and advocating saving and reserves after increasing production and income. This has not only strengthened the agricultural cooperatives' ability to expand production and resist disasters, but also reduced the burden on the state. After increasing production last year, the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Yangjiazhuang, Shexian County, paid attention to expanding public accumulation. In addition to using public accumulation to buy 2,800 sheep and 40 pigs, it also deposited 19,990 yuan in the bank; 24.5% of the cooperative's farmers have savings deposits in the bank. This cooperative had already reached the production level of a local wealthy middle peasant last year. After planning, after ensuring the completion of the state's tax tasks, the surplus grain and money left over by next year will be enough for one year's consumption. This plan has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of cooperative members to work diligently and manage their households frugally.

Regarding how to save and reserve grain, Handan Prefecture adopted two methods during the key trial implementation: (1) Universally mobilize members to calculate carefully and save grain as much as possible; (2) After ensuring the completion of the state's grain purchase and compression of grain sales tasks, and solving the cooperative's investment expenditures, agricultural cooperatives will reserve a portion of grain each year from the expanded public accumulation. This part of the grain is stored by the agricultural cooperative with the national grain department through the establishment of reserve procedures or the use of revolving certificates (settled once a year) to the state (that is, the state pays the money, and the cooperative is allowed to buy it again when it needs it). This method is supported by all cooperatives with the conditions for storage. For example, the Zhaomulian Agricultural Cooperative in Yongnian County was originally a grain-deficient cooperative. After increasing production this year, in addition to selling 20,000 catties of grain to the state and preparing to store more than 40,000 catties to the national grain department in the form of revolving grain, the average per capita grain consumption is still 479 catties.

Some agricultural cooperatives have accepted past experiences and lessons and decided to appropriately expand public accumulation this year. The members' representative assembly of the Rongsheng Cooperative in Zhuchang Township, Wu'an County, decided to retain 8% of the total income for the public accumulation fund and 2% for the public welfare fund this year. Together with agricultural taxes and production investment costs, a total of 34% will be deducted from the total income. Even so, the average distribution to each member can still reach 146 yuan, an increase of 32 yuan compared to last year. This cooperative has decided to take 60,000 yuan from the public accumulation to build an electric pumping station, which can expand the irrigated area by 4,000 mu; take 2,500 yuan to build a granular fertilizer plant, which can increase the application of 50 catties of granular fertilizer per mu of cultivated land. In order to realize irrigation mechanization, the Liu Hancun Agricultural Cooperative in Yongnian County also plans to purchase 14 boiler-towing machines and dig 10 machine wells with the expanded public accumulation on the basis of ensuring increased income for the members, which will greatly benefit the increase in production of the entire cooperative.

These facts show that only by correctly adjusting the relationship between accumulation and consumption in agricultural cooperatives, appropriately expanding public accumulation on the basis of increased production, and advocating saving and reserves can we promote the rapid development of agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives.

    农业社在增产增收以后需要解决的一个重要问题
    扩大公共积累  注意节约储备
    河北省邯郸专区的情况提供了一些经验教训
    本报讯  农业生产合作社在增产增收以后，是否扩大公共积累、注意节约储备，对于能否迅速提高生产水平以及巩固和提高农业社，有重大的关系。河北省邯郸专区的情况证明了这一点。
    邯郸专区现有农业社三千六百零七个。由于生产的增长，社员的实际收入大有增加。预计今年在平原区有六百九十三个社每人平均收入八十元至一百八十元，在山区有一百四十六个社每人平均收入五十元至一百元。这些社的社员的实际收入，已经相当或超过合作化以前当地农民较高的生活水平。
    但是，从去年以来，在一些增产增收的农业社中，新的问题出现了，忽视公共积累、忽视扩大再生产的现象相当严重。如肥乡县西南庄农业社在去年增产以后，把绝大部分粮款都分配给社员，全社一百零一户就盖了新房九十余间，买自行车二十辆，而农业社今年的生产投资却筹措不起来，只好卖掉两头骡子。涉县山区活水峧农业社社员，去年每人平均实际收入增加到一百三十元，而社里不仅没有扣留今年的生产投资，还从国家贷款中拿出二千元分给社员，因而今年生产发生了很多困难，社员的收入也就减少了，预计每人只能分到六十七元。在一些社员中，增产不节约、增收不储备、不勤不俭的现象也有所滋长。如武安县竹昌乡荣胜农业社一千零五十户，去年每人平均收入一百一十四元，一年来社员光建设坟墓就有一百九十一处，有的人三十余岁就为自己预先建好了坟墓；而这个社去年扣留的公积金和公益金却只占总收入的3.6％，除了解决“五保”户的生活和应归还的社员生产资料作价外，无法自己解决扩大再生产的投资问题。
    与上述情况相反，有些农业社在增产增收以后，及时注意扩大公共积累，提倡节约储备。这不仅加强了农业社扩大生产和抗灾的能力，而且减轻了国家的负担。涉县杨家庄星火农业社在去年增产以后，注意扩大公共积累，除社内用公共积累买羊二千八百只、猪四十头外，并存入银行一万九千九百九十元；全社有24.5％的农户在银行有储蓄存款。这个社去年已经达到当地富裕中农的生产水平，经过规划，在保证完成国家的税收任务以后，到明年节余下来的余粮、余款，将可够一年的消费。这个规划大大激发了社员勤劳生产、勤俭持家的积极性。
    如何节约和储备粮食，邯郸专区在重点试办时采取了两个办法：（一）普遍号召社员精打细算，尽量节约粮食；（二）农业社在保证完成国家粮食征购和压缩粮食销量的任务，以及解决社内投资的开支以后，从扩大公共积累中逐年储备一部分粮食。这部分粮食由农业社同国家粮食部门建立储备手续或用周转证的办法（每年清结一次）向国家储存（即由国家出钱，社内需要时允许再买）。这个办法，在有条件储备的社都表示拥护。如永年县赵目连农业社原为缺粮社，今年增产后，除了卖给国家二万斤粮食，并准备以周转粮的形式向国家粮食部门储存四万多斤以外，每人平均粮食消费额还有四百七十九斤。
    有些农业社接受了过去的经验教训，决定在今年适当地扩大公共积累。武安县竹昌乡荣胜社社员代表大会决定，在今年全年总收入中，扣留公积金8％、公益金2％，加上农业税和生产投资等费用，共从总收入里扣除34％。就是这样，每个社员的平均分益还可达到一百四十六元，比去年增加三十二元。这个社已经决定从公共积累中拿出六万元建设电力扬水站一处，可以扩大水浇地四千亩；拿出二千五百元建立颗粒肥料厂一处，每亩耕地可增施颗粒肥料五十斤。永年县刘汉村农业社为了实现灌溉机械化，也计划在保证社员增加收入的基础上，用扩大的公共积累购置锅驼机十四部，打机井十眼，这对全社的增产将有很大的作用。
    这些事实说明了，只有正确地调节农业社的积累和消费的关系，在增产的基础上适当地扩大公共积累和提倡节约储备，才能促进农业生产的迅速发展和农业社的巩固。
