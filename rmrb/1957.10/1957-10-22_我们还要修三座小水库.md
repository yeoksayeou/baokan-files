    We Need to Build Three More Small Reservoirs
    Ma Jingfang, Deputy Director of Guanghua Agricultural Cooperative, Yangcun Township, Quyang County

    Our village is located in the northern part of Yaoshan Mountain. The two branches of the Mengliang River run through it from east to west. Every flood season, the floods rush down fiercely, causing most of our cooperative's land to be flooded. In 1955, 1,860 mu of seedlings were washed away, and 650 mu were buried by sand. However, due to the steep terrain and rapid surface runoff, the water quickly recedes, often leading to drought, making it difficult to plant in the spring and ensure a good harvest in the fall.

    At that time, although the farmers wanted to turn water damage into water conservancy and develop irrigation, they could not achieve this due to the limitations of the individual economy. Since the realization of cooperation in 1955, cadres and members have been brewing the idea of building a reservoir in Wangzhuang and Shixia Gully to control floods and irrigate the land. However, because the agricultural cooperative had just been established, individual cooperative cadres still had ideological concerns, fearing that the project would be too large, unaffordable, and affect the lives of the members. Later, everyone found the example of 1955 where irrigated millet yielded 128 jin per mu, while dry millet yielded 80 jin per mu, and after accounting and comparison, the enthusiasm of the cadres and members for building water conservancy was aroused. Through the cooperative committee and the general meeting of members, it was decided to build these two reservoirs.

    Large-scale construction began in mid-March 1956. After more than five months of active efforts by the members, the two reservoirs were finally completed and filled with water in August 1956. This year, using it to irrigate 900 mu of crops, grain production increased by more than 45,000 jin with only one irrigation. All the members believe that the reservoir is our treasure.

    How did we do it during the construction of the reservoir?

    ① Widely carry out publicity and mobilization to fully mobilize the masses. Our township general branch first convened meetings of the Youth League branch, the Women's Federation, and the cultural and educational section to mobilize party members, Youth League members, and propagandists to use blackboard newspapers, meetings, and other methods to publicize the benefits of building reservoirs and irrigating the land. At the same time, we also educated the members with examples of the comparison between irrigated and dry land and water and drought disasters, thereby arousing the members' enthusiasm for building reservoirs. The number of people participating in water conservancy construction increased from 70 to more than 250 per day.

    ② Party members, Youth League members, and cadres take the lead, and the masses and members follow. During the construction, party members, Youth League members, and cadres actively participated in labor to lead the masses. The fifty-year-old chief commander of the construction, Ma Luolou (director of the cooperative), went to the construction site every day to lead the labor and guide the construction technology. The masses called him "engineer."

    ③ Unify the planning of labor, set different quotas according to different tasks, and implement group piecework, which greatly aroused the enthusiasm of the members. Before the Wang Yanhai group implemented piecework, each person only cut 1.3 zhang of stone per day. After implementing piecework, they cut 2.6-3 zhang. The stone-carrying group increased work efficiency by 20% after implementing piecework, overcoming the procrastination phenomenon in the early stage of construction and ensuring attendance rate.

    Our two reservoirs launched friendship competitions during construction, which improved work efficiency and ensured project quality. The Zheng Xiangshui group, which used to drill 1.5 meters, drilled 3 meters in the competition after finding the knack. The women's stone-carrying group was praised by all the members for proposing the competition.

    While carrying out the above work, we paid attention to strengthening political and ideological work. Every day, during upper and lower work and rest time, we explained construction techniques and conducted safety and health education. At the same time, we verbally praised and materially rewarded model workers who worked actively, and criticized those who had poor work attitudes. In terms of life, we promptly solved the problem of eating dry food and drinking boiled water at the construction site. In addition, district and county leaders often went to the construction site to express their condolences and lent radios to enliven the construction site life.

    These two reservoirs have withstood the test of the extraordinary floods of 1956. Because they completely controlled the water势 (shi - power) of the upper reaches of the southern branch of the Mengliang River, thousands of mu of crops downstream were spared from flooding. This year, thanks to the use of water from the reservoir, we overcame two severe droughts. In addition, more than 600 jin of fish were caught in the reservoir, and more than 50 ducks were raised, increasing the sideline income of the members. When the gates were opened to irrigate the land, many members recited the poem on the reservoir construction monument: "Mountain floods are collected in the reservoir, water is diverted to irrigate rice paddies in dry weather, many years of water disasters have been turned into water conservancy, don't forget Chairman Mao's kindness."

    We have changed from poor to rich here, but all our members are not satisfied with the achievements we have made. Based on the principle of comprehensive management and overall development, we have made a water conservancy plan, planning to complete three more small reservoirs, fifty gully dams, two hundred and thirty water storage ponds, two hundred and fifty mu of fish-scale pits, two hundred mu of silted land, and four thousand five hundred mu of terraced fields this winter and next spring. Some of these projects have already started construction. We believe that by the end of the second five-year plan, this will become a beautiful rural area with "mountains covered with green and clear water everywhere." By then, the living standards of our members will exceed those of well-to-do middle peasants.

    我们还要修三座小水库
    曲阳县羊村乡光华农业社副社长　马敬芳
    我村位于尧山北部，境内有孟良河两条支流东西贯穿，每到汛期洪水下泄很猛，使我社大部土地淹涝成灾。1955年冲毁禾苗一千八百六十亩，砂压六百五十亩。但由于地势坡陡，地面径流很快，水过地干，也常常呈现旱象，形成春不易播种，秋不能保收。
    当时农民虽有变水害为水利，发展灌溉的要求，但由于农民处于个体经济的限制，根本无法实现。自1955年实现合作化以后，干部和社员们就开始酝酿要在王庄和石匣沟修建一座水库，拦洪浇地。但是，由于农业社刚刚成立，个别社干部还有思想顾虑，怕工程大，修不起，影响社员生活。后来大家找出1955年水浇谷亩产一百二十八斤，旱谷亩产八十斤的实例进行算账对比，才启发了干部、社员兴修水利的热情，通过社委会和社员大会，决定修这两个水库。
    自1956年3月中旬开始了大规模的施工。经过五个多月社员的积极努力，终于在1956年8月两个水库全部竣工，并且蓄满了水。今年利用它灌溉的九百亩作物，只灌溉一次就增产粮食四万五千余斤。全体社员都认为水库是我们的宝贝。
    我们在修水库施工当中是怎么做的呢？
    ①广泛地展开宣传动员，充分发动群众。我们乡总支部首先召开了团支部、妇联会和文教股等各部门和宣传员会议，发动党、团员和宣传员利用黑板报、开会等方式，进行了修水库浇地能得收益的宣传。同时还利用水旱田对比和水旱灾害的实例教育了社员，从而启发了社员修水库的积极性，每天参加修水利的人由七十增加到二百五十多。
    ②党、团、干部齐下手，群众社员跟着走。在施工当中，党、团员和干部，都积极参加劳动，带动群众。五十岁的施工总指挥马洛楼（社长）每天到工地带头劳动，并指导兴修技术，群众叫他“工程师”。
    ③统一规划劳力，根据不同的活计，制定不同的定额，实行分组按件包工，大大启发了社员的积极性。王彦海组没有按件包工以前，每人每天仅打石一点三丈，实行包工后他们就打二点六—三丈。抬石组实行包工后提高工作效率20％，克服了开工初期的拖沓现象，保证了出勤率。
    我们这两个水库在施工当中都展开了友谊竞赛，提高了工作效率，保证了工程质量。打钎的郑香水组原来打一点五公尺，在竞赛中经过找窍门打到三公尺。运石妇女组由于提出竞赛，受到了全体社员的称赞。
    在进行上面这些工作的同时，我们注意加强了政治思想工作，每天都在上、下工和休息时间进行修建技术的讲解和安全卫生的教育，同时对积极工作的模范人物进行口头表扬和物质奖励，对劳动态度不好的给以批评。在生活上及时解决了工地吃干粮喝开水问题。此外，区县领导上还经常去工地慰问，贷给收音机，活跃工地生活。
    这两个水库已经经受了1956年特大洪水的考验，由于它全部控制了孟良河南支上游水势，下游几千亩庄稼免除淹涝。今年由于引用水库的水，战胜了两次严重的旱灾。另外，在水库里还捕鱼六百余斤，养鸭五十余只，增加了社员们的副业收入。提闸浇地时还有很多社员念起了水库建成纪念碑上的诗歌：“山洪收进水库哩，天旱引水浇稻畦，多年水患变水利，恩情莫忘毛主席。”
    我们这里由穷变富了，可是我们全体社员并不满足于已得的成就。我们本着综合治理，全面开发的方针，又作了水利规划，计划在今冬明春，再完成小水库三座，谷坊坝五十座，涝池二百三十个，鱼鳞坑二百五十亩，成滩二百亩，土埂畦田四千五百亩。这些工程，有的现已动工修建。我们相信，到第二个五年计划末我们这里就成了一个“无山不绿，有水皆清”的美丽农村了。到那时，我们社员的生活水平将超过富裕中农了。
