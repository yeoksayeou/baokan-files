Small Ideas

　　Chrysanthemums broken off and placed in a vase tend to wither easily. To make them last longer, dissolve a little sugar in the water in the vase.

　　Kettles used for boiling water often have a layer of scale that is very difficult to clean. If you put some water in the kettle and add a cup of vinegar, then bring it to a boil, the scale will be removed.

　　Vinegar will mold after being stored for a long time. If you add a little stir-fried salt, it can be stored for a long time without molding.

　　＊Dark-colored clothing (such as navy serge suit trousers) often develops a shine in areas of friction, which is unsightly. The solution: apply a liquid of half water and half vinegar to the shiny area, let it dry, and then apply it again. Afterward, cover it with a dry cloth and iron it with a hot iron over the cloth.

　　If you spill ink on a carpet, you can immediately wash it away with milk.

　　The temperature of the water used to wash woolen clothes must be consistent; it cannot be hot and then cold, because wool will shrink if it is suddenly exposed to cold and then hot. Therefore, before washing, prepare enough warm water. At the same time, do not rub; simply rinse it up and down and left and right in the water, and the dirt will gradually fall into the water.

　　小主意
    菊花折下插在瓶中时容易枯死，若要耐久，可将糖少许溶入瓶中。
    煮水的壶内往往有一层积垢，很不容易洗净。如在壶内放一些水再加一杯醋，搁在火上沸滚，就会除去积垢。
    醋久藏后会生霉，如稍为放进些炒过的盐，就可久藏不霉。
    ＊深色衣料（如藏青哔叽西装裤等）常会在摩擦处发生亮光，很不好看。除去的办法：在发亮部分敷上水、醋各半的液体，等干后再敷一次，随后在上面复一方干布，用热熨斗隔布烫烫就行了。
    地毯上沾了墨水渍，可以立刻用牛奶把它洗掉。
  洗绒线衣服用水的温度必须一律，不可忽冷忽热，因为绒线忽而遇冷忽而遇热，一定皱缩。所以在洗之前，先要预备好充足的温水。同时不能揉搓，只能在水中上下左右涤荡，污垢自会渐渐落到水中。
