    Jia the Blind Man in "The Story of Fu Nu"
    Shan Bo
    It is said that this play has not been performed for a long time, and it has only recently been excavated from the traditional Sichuan opera repertoire. After watching the performance by the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Theater, it is not difficult to understand the reasons for its disappearance: the script has a strong populist character, or rather, the playwright was too bold. He dared to turn the moral concepts of feudal society upside down, and even the feudal social order was shattered by him. The prefect is a corrupt and lawless official, the bandits are heroes who rid the people of harm, and the poor boy is a hero who helps in times of need. In the end, the victimized people were vindicated, and the feudal officials were killed. It is no wonder that the playwright, Ye Zhifei from Suzhou in the early Qing Dynasty, was imprisoned for this reason (see Zhou Yibai: Random Notes After Watching Sichuan Opera, published in the Beijing Daily). His original work, "Amber Spoon," contains such blatant criticisms of feudal society and is full of rebellious spirit: "In the temples are beasts in clothing, in the green forests are saviors." Although the current script does not have these two sentences, the artistic image highlights this theme.
    The most prominent character in the play is Jia the Blind Man. He is a poor man who makes a living by singing storytelling. Touched by the help of Tao Fu Nu, the daughter of a frustrated and disillusioned scholar, when the Tao family is persecuted by the government, he steps forward to spread the news of Fu Nu's unjust treatment, achieving the goal of saving her and seeking revenge. The script portrays this character as intelligent, righteous, enthusiastic, and brave. The comedian Xiao Nong's excellent acting successfully creates a typical working-class character with valuable qualities. The scholar's daughter treats Jia the Blind Man with an equal attitude, calling him Brother Jia. Jia the Blind Man also repays her on an equal footing. Tao Fu Nu's painting should have been given to the greedy shopkeeper woman who came to ask for it first, letting her get rich; but Fu Nu unhesitatingly gave the painting to Jia the Blind Man, because he could sell the painting to avoid freezing and starvation. Jia the Blind Man is grateful for the charity, and even more moved by the giver's kind and pure heart. Later, when Fu Nu is forced into a brothel, Jia the Blind Man devises a plan to save her. His repayment to the benefactor, because of his upright and respectable behavior, does not feel like a mere personal repayment of gratitude, unlike the feudal master-servant relationship commonly seen in traditional operas, but has a broader significance. When Jia the Blind Man goes to the brothel to visit, even though he cannot see, he knows that the suffering Tao Fu Nu is standing in front of him, and he cries out in pain: "Miss Tao, how are you? It's a pity I can't see..." Jia the Blind Man's excited feelings, his sympathy and pity for Fu Nu, and the burst of grief and anger, deeply moved the audience. This is not a relationship of love between a man and a woman (perhaps because it is portrayed too often in operas, it often feels ordinary, or it is more difficult to portray well, and it is difficult to elevate the sentiment), but rather a different kind of relationship, a relationship between fellow sufferers under oppression. Tao Fu Nu's side has deep sympathy and complete trust in the poor working people, and Jia the Blind Man's side does not feel that he is reaching too high, but rather acts righteously, regardless of personal gain or loss, to protect the innocent persecuted. The audience gladly accepts the edification of this pure and noble emotion.
    The actor's singing, dialogue, and actions constantly show the characteristics of a blind man, and the performance is very realistic. (The playwright's use of such a name for this positive character is obviously intentional. It clearly says that this blind man is fake, he sees clearly and distinguishes right from wrong.) Gao Fenglian also plays Tao Fu Nu well, with rich, authentic, and strong expressions. The hatred and resistance to the feudal ruling class shown by the two actors are genuine. They are both Communist Party members. I think that modern actors who have received class education can perform the ancient working people more realistically and deeply, just as socialist realism is used to handle classical plays. It is no coincidence that an old play can give the audience a new atmosphere.

    “芙奴传”里的贾瞎子
    山柏
    据说这部戏久已不演，最近才在川剧传统剧目中发掘出来。看了重庆川剧院的演出，不难体会到它的所以失传的原因：剧本有强烈的人民性，或者说是剧作者太大胆了，他敢于把封建社会的道德观念颠了个倒，连封建社会秩序，也被他打得个落花流水。知府是贪赃枉法的狗官，强盗是为民除害的豪杰，贫儿是仗义救难的英雄。最后，受害的人民伸了冤，封建官吏被杀死。无怪剧作者清初苏州人叶稚斐因此而下狱（见北京日报载，周贻白：川剧观后琐记）。他的原作“琥珀匙”中还有这样露骨地抨击封建社会、充满反抗精神的句子：“庙堂中有衣冠禽兽，绿林内有救世菩萨。”虽则现在的剧本没有这两句，艺术形象却突出了这个主题。
    剧中最突出的人物是贾瞎子，他是一个依靠唱书为生的贫民，感于潦倒失意的贡生的女儿陶芙奴的周济，当陶家被官府迫害时，挺身而出，替芙奴传布遭冤的新闻，达到了救人报仇的目的。剧本把这个人物写得聪明、正义、热情、勇敢。丑角演员笑侬的出色的演技成功地创造了一个具有可贵品质的劳动人民典型。那个读书人的女儿以平等的态度对待贾瞎子，唤他为贾大哥。贾瞎子对她，也是站在平等的地位上来回报。陶芙奴的画原该送给先来索画的市侩店妈，让她去发财；但芙奴毫不犹豫地把画送给了贾瞎子，因为他拿画去卖了，才能免于冻饿。贾瞎子感激受施，更感动于施与者的那片善良纯洁的心。后来芙奴被罚入妓院，贾瞎子设计救她，他对施与者的报答，由于行为的正直可敬，也就不觉得仅仅是个人之间的感恩图报，不像一般戏曲中所常见的那种封建气味十分浓厚的主仆关系，而具有较宽广的意义了。当贾瞎子到妓院去探望，虽则看不见却知道受难的陶芙奴已经站在面前的时候，他痛呼道：“陶姑娘，你好吗？可惜我看不见……”贾瞎子的激动的感情，他对芙奴的同情和怜惜，以及一齐迸发出来的悲痛和愤恨，深深地感动了观众。这里不是男女爱情关系（也许因为在戏曲里表现得多了，反而往往觉得平常，或者说更难于表现得好，难于把情操提高一步），而是另外一种关系，受压迫的同难朋友的关系。陶芙奴这一边对贫苦劳动人民的具有深厚的同情和完全的信任，贾瞎子这一边丝毫不觉得自己高攀，而是见义勇为，不计利害，保卫无辜的被迫害者。观众欣慰地接受了这种纯洁高尚的感情的熏沐。
    演员的唱白和动作随时随刻都表现人物是个瞎子的特点，演得十分逼真。（剧作者给这个正面人物起这样一个名字，显然也是有用意的。这明明是说，这个瞎子是假的，他看得清楚，明辨是非。）高凤莲演陶芙奴也是演得好的，表情丰富、真实、强烈。两位演员所表现的对封建统治阶级的仇恨和反抗，是动了真火的。他们都是共产党员，我想，由现代的受过阶级教育的演员来演古代的劳动人民，是会演得更加真实深刻的，正如用社会主义现实主义的方法来处理古典剧一样。一个旧戏却能给观众以新的气息，不会是偶然的。
