Run Enterprises Through Diligence and Thrift, Increase Steel Production More
　　The Soviet Union produced more than 80 million tons of steel in 1956, but in 1919, not long after the victory of the October Revolution, only one small blast furnace was in operation. Over the past forty years, through arduous efforts and relying on the spirit of diligence and thrift in running enterprises, the Soviet people built countless blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces from small to large. The slogan "The Soviet Union should become a steel country" has finally been realized. The upper left picture shows the blast furnace area of the current Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works. How magnificent it is! The lower right picture shows the "tent city" at the construction site of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Plant in 1929. At that time, this was still a wilderness, and workers used their bare hands in the freezing cold to build today's steel giant. (Attached pictures)

　　勤俭办企业  钢铁增产多
    苏联在1956年生产了八千多万吨钢铁，但是在1919年十月革命胜利不久时，只有一座小型高炉开着工。四十年来，苏联人民经过千辛万苦，依靠勤俭办企业的精神，从小到大，兴建了无数的高炉和平炉，“苏联应该成为钢铁国家”的口号，终于实现了。左图是现在的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂的高炉区，看它多么雄伟！下图是1929年马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金工厂建设工地的“帐幕城”，那时这里还是一片荒地，工人们在严寒中用双手建立起今天的钢铁巨人。（附图片）
