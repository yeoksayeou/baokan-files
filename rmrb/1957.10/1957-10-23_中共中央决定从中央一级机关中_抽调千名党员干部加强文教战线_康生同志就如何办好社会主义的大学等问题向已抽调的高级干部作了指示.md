Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: The CCP Central Committee has decided to transfer one thousand senior and mid-level Party member cadres from central-level Party and government organs to work in universities, middle schools, and several scientific and cultural-educational units in order to strengthen the Party's leadership over the cultural and educational front. Of the one thousand people to be transferred, two hundred are cadres at the level of director or bureau chief and above, and eight hundred are cadres at the level of section chief or division chief and above. Currently, the transfer of one hundred and thirty-seven senior cadres has been confirmed, and more than sixty have happily taken up their new posts. The transfer of eight hundred mid-level cadres is actively underway.

Of the one hundred and thirty-seven senior cadres whose transfer has been confirmed, one hundred and eight are being sent to ninety-three universities and colleges, twenty-five are being sent to twenty scientific research institutions, and four are being sent to three newspapers. They will respectively serve as presidents, vice-presidents, deans, vice-deans, Party committee secretaries, or deputy Party committee secretaries of higher education institutions; directors or deputy directors of scientific research institutes; and editors-in-chief or deputy editors-in-chief of newspapers, and other leadership positions.

This group of senior cadres being sent to work on the cultural and educational front generally possesses good political quality, a relatively high ideological level, a good work style, good health, and the ability to unite with intellectuals. Their cultural level and leadership ability are also capable of undertaking the leadership work of various cultural and educational departments. Among the one hundred and thirty-seven people, there are five deputy minister-level cadres, ten assistant minister-level cadres, and one hundred and twenty-two director and bureau-level cadres. Liu Yongru, Vice Minister of Finance, who originally graduated from Beijing Normal University, has now returned to his alma mater as Vice President. Lu Ping, who was assigned to Peking University as Vice President, was originally Vice Minister of Railways. Jiang Junchen, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, was transferred to the Scientific Planning Commission of the State Council as Deputy Secretary-General. All twenty-five people transferred to scientific research institutions are college graduates or returned students.

The situation revealed in the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle shows that political work is weak and the leadership is insufficient in many universities, middle schools, and other cultural and educational units in our country. The Central Committee attaches great importance to this and has decided to transfer one thousand outstanding senior and mid-level cadres from central Party and government organs to strengthen the cultural and educational front. In order to conscientiously implement the decision, the Organization Department of the CCP Central Committee, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee, the Ministry of Higher Education, and many other relevant departments, as well as the CCP provincial and municipal committees, have carried out meticulous organizational and ideological work. After carefully studying the leadership cadre situation of various cultural and educational units, the number of people to be transferred, from which department to transfer, and who to transfer were determined, and then approved by the CCP Central Committee. The senior cadres of government departments who needed to be transferred were also approved by the State Council. The central Party and government departments that needed to transfer cadres resolutely implemented the central decision and transferred outstanding cadres. Many of the cadres who were transferred expressed their obedience to the Party's decision and their determination to do a good job on the cultural and educational front. This ensured that the transferred cadres were relatively outstanding. After the two hundred senior cadres who were decided to be transferred are sent to the cultural and educational front by the end of this year, the urgently needed leading backbone in universities and scientific research institutions across the country can be basically resolved, and individual deficiencies will be supplemented by the provinces and cities themselves.

Before leaving Beijing, the more than sixty senior cadres who had already gone to the cultural and educational front were convened by the Central Propaganda Department and the Central Organization Department to attend a meeting to discuss how to do a good job in the cultural and educational departments. At this meeting, Comrade Kang Sheng gave instructions on how to run socialist universities well and other issues.

    中共中央决定从中央一级机关中
    抽调千名党员干部加强文教战线
    康生同志就如何办好社会主义的大学等问题向已抽调的高级干部作了指示
    新华社22日讯　中共中央决定从中央一级党政机关中，抽调一千名高级、中级党员干部，派往大、中学校和若干科学、文教单位去工作，以加强党对文教战线的领导。决定抽调的一千人中，有司、局长级以上的干部二百人，处长、科长级以上的干部八百人。目前有一百三十七名高级干部已经确定抽调，其中六十多人已经愉快地走上了新的工作岗位；八百名中级干部的抽调工作，正在积极进行中。
    在确定抽调的一百三十七名高级干部中，有一百零八人派往九十三所大专学校，二十五人派往二十所科学研究机构，四人派往三家报纸。他们将分别担任高等学校的正副校长、院长，正副党委书记；科学研究所的正副所长；报纸的正副总编辑等领导职务。
    这批被派往文教战线工作的高级干部，一般都具备政治修养较好、思想水平较高、作风好、身体好、能团结知识分子等条件，他们的文化水平和领导能力也是能够胜任各种文教部门的领导工作的。在一百三十七人当中，有副部长级干部五人，部长助理级干部十人，司、局级干部一百二十二人。财政部副部长刘墉如，原来是北京师范大学毕业生，现在又回到母校，担任副校长；被派往北京大学担任副校长的陆平，原来是铁道部副部长；中华全国供销合作总社副主任姜君辰，被调往国务院科学规划委员会担任副秘书长。调往科学研究机构工作的二十五人，都是大学生或留学生。
    从整风运动和反右派斗争中暴露的情况表明，我国许多大、中学校和其它文教单位的政治工作薄弱，领导力量不足，中央对此十分重视，决定从中央党政机关中抽调一千名优秀的高级和中级干部以加强文教战线。为了认真执行中央的决定，中共中央组织部、中共中央宣传部、高等教育部等许多有关部门和中共各省、市委都进行了细致的组织工作和思想工作。在对各文教单位的领导干部情况进行了仔细的研究以后，确定需要调多少人，从那个部门调，调谁去，再经中共中央批准，其中被抽调的政府部门的高级干部还经过了国务院的批准。需要调出干部的中央党政部门，都坚决执行中央决定，把优秀的干部调出去。许多被抽调的干部都表示服从党的决定，决心在文教战线上把工作搞好。这样就保证了抽调的干部都是比较优秀的。到今年年底，决定抽调的二百名高级干部都派到文教战线以后，全国各高等学校、科学研究机构迫切需要的领导骨干基本上可以解决，个别不足的，由各省市自行补充。
    已经前往文教战线的六十多名高级干部，在离开北京前，中央宣传部、中央组织部曾召集他们开会座谈到文教部门如何做好工作的问题，在这个会议上，康生同志对如何办好社会主义的大学等问题作了指示。
