    Yunnan Minority Areas
    Largely Achieved Agricultural Cooperativization
    (Our Kunming Dispatch) Agricultural cooperativization has been achieved in areas accounting for over 70% of the total minority population in Yunnan Province. A new change is taking place in the historically poor and backward production and lifestyles left over in these areas.
    Before liberation, the Kawa, Lisu, Jingpo, Blang, Youle, and Kucong ethnic groups, who lived in the border areas of Yunnan, were still in the primitive society stage. The Yi people in the Liangshan area lived in a slave society. The Dai, Hani, Tibetan, and Bai ethnic groups were in feudal societies. After liberation, with the strong assistance of the state, these areas directly and steadily transitioned to socialist society through the road of mutual assistance and cooperation.
    Due to the different economic and cultural levels and customs of the various ethnic minorities, full consideration has been given to the characteristics of each ethnic group in the process of cooperativization in various places. In those areas with particularly backward production, the Party and the government have also adopted the form of production and cultural stations to help the ethnic groups develop production and culture. Eighteen such stations have now been established throughout the province.
    With the change in the mode of production, the primitive production methods and backward ideas of the various ethnic groups have also undergone tremendous changes. The Dai farmers, who historically had no habit of applying fertilizer, are now also starting to apply fertilizer. New agricultural tools have appeared in places where slash-and-burn cultivation was practiced, and farmers have learned to grow vegetables and rice. In terms of thinking, the habit of slaughtering cattle to sacrifice to ghosts and not transplanting seedlings without sacrificing to ghosts, which has existed for many years, is gradually changing. Oxen have become the treasures of the cooperatives and are no longer objects of sacrifice to ghosts.
    After cooperativization, the lives of farmers of all ethnic groups have also greatly improved. Of the sixty-seven cooperatives experimentally set up in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture last year, sixty-six increased production, and 83% of the members increased their income. The cooperatives in the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region (Prefecture) generally increased production by 15% to 30%. The first batch of cooperatives experimentally set up in the Lancang Lahu Autonomous Region (County) last year all increased production, with the highest increasing more than twofold. In the Mangbage Dai Cooperative in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, among the thirty-two member households in the whole cooperative, only seven had enough to eat in the year before the cooperative was established; after cooperativization, there was not a single household in the cooperative that lacked food.

### 云南少数民族地区  大部实现了农业合作化

    云南少数民族地区
    大部实现了农业合作化
    本报昆明电　占云南全省少数民族人口70％以上的地区，已经实现了农业合作化。这些地区历史上遗留下来的贫困落后的生产、生活方式正在发生一种新的变化。
    解放前，聚居在云南边境的佧佤、傈僳、景颇、布朗、攸乐、苦聪等民族，还是处在原始社会阶段；凉山地区的彝族，过着奴隶社会的生活；傣、哈尼、藏、白等民族处在封建社会。解放后，这些地区在国家的大力帮助下，通过互助合作的道路，直接、稳步地过渡到了社会主义社会。
    由于各少数民族的经济文化水平和风俗习惯不同，各地在合作化的过程中都充分注意到照顾各民族的特点。在那些生产特别落后的地区，党和政府还采取了生产文化站的形式，帮助各民族发展生产和文化。这样的站，目前全省已经建立了十八个。
    随着生产方式的改变，各民族的原始生产方法和落后的思想也发生了巨大变化：历史上从没有施肥习惯的傣族农民，现在也都开始施肥了；原来“刀耕火种”的地方也有了新的农具，农民们学会了种菜、种水稻。在思想方面，多少年来杀牛祭鬼、不祭鬼不撒秧的习惯，正在逐渐改变，耕牛成为了合作社的财宝，不再是祭鬼之物。
    合作化以后，各族农民的生活也有了很大的提高。怒江傈僳族自治州去年试办的六十七个合作社中，有六十六个社增了产，83％的社员增加了收入。红河哈尼族自治区（州）的合作社，一般都增产15％到30％。澜沧拉祜族自治区（县）去年试办的第一批合作社，社社增产，最多的增产一倍以上。西双版纳傣族自治州芒八阁傣族合作社，全社三十二户社员当中，在办社的前一年只有七户够吃；合作化以后，全社没有一个缺粮户。
