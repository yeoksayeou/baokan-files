The Hebei delegation is a magnificent team. Among them, two are first-class athletes, and three are participating in the triathlon. Worth mentioning is Tian Chunxiang, a fifteen-year-old girl, who broke the province's long jump record and is participating in national competitions for the second time. Chen Mei, a veteran who participated in the National Games as early as twenty years ago, is now a mother of four; but last year she was still the provincial record holder for the pentathlon, and this time she is participating in the pentathlon.

The delegation has eleven female athletes and twenty-four male athletes.

    雄壮的河北代表队
    河北代表队是一支雄壮的队伍。其中有两名是一级运动员，有三人参加三项全能比赛。值得介绍的，还有一个十五岁的小姑娘田春香，她打破省的跳远纪录，而且参加全国性的比赛已经是第二次了。早在二十年前就参加了全国运动会的老将陈梅，现在已经是四个孩子的妈妈了；但她去年还是五项全能的省纪录保持者，这次她参加五项全能比赛。
    这个代表队共有女运动员十一名，男运动员二十四名。
