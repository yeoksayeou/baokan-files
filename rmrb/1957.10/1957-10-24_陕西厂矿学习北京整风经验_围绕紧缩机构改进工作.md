Shaanxi Factories and Mines Learn from Beijing's Rectification Experience
Improve Work Centered on Streamlining Organizations

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, October 23rd) Learning from the rectification experience of factories and mines in Beijing, first making major changes after the great blooming and contending, and then engaging in major debates, is the characteristic of the current rectification movement in factories and mines in Shaanxi.

Before National Day, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee respectively convened symposiums of the heads of the Party committees of various industrial cities and the secretaries of the Party committees of large factories and mines to review the rectification situation in various factories and mines. They required all factories to learn from the rectification experience of factories and mines in Beijing and, before October 15, to resolve 50% of the problems raised by employees that could be resolved by their respective units. After National Day, comrades from the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees responsible for leading industry went deep into the factories to provide specific guidance, and all factories generally stepped up their work to improve, reaching and exceeding the requirements set by the Provincial Party Committee by the 15th. The Shaanxi No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory had reached 90%.

During this period, the main focus of rectification and improvement work in various factories and mines was on streamlining organizations, and the improvement of many other tasks was also centered on streamlining organizations. Many factories also paid special attention to implementing the mass line, fully mobilizing the masses to repeatedly discuss, supplement, and revise the preliminary streamlining plans.

After the high tide of blooming and contending, the Party Committee of the Sanqiao Vehicle Repair Factory of the Ministry of Railways proposed learning from the experience of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, streamlining organizations with a revolutionary spirit. At the same time, the leadership assigned special personnel to widely collect opinions from the masses and formulate a preliminary plan for streamlining organizations. The plan decided to abolish all seventeen existing sections and establish a factory director's office, a chief engineer's office, and an administrative welfare section. The plan also stipulated that the existing twelve workshops and one directly subordinate team would be merged into seven workshops. After this organizational restructuring, the factory could reduce the existing four hundred and fifteen cadres by two hundred and forty-three, reducing the proportion of cadres to the total number of employees from 22.1% to 9.2%. After the preliminary plan was formulated, the factory successively convened expanded meetings of the Party committee, general meetings of Party members and the Communist Youth League, meetings of employee representatives, general meetings of all employees, and various forms of symposiums, where the plan was hotly debated. As a result of the debate, everyone unanimously agreed to the plan and also put forward many supplementary and corrective opinions. For example, the original plan stipulated that the factory director's office should have ten cadres doing planning and statistics work. During the discussion, some people suggested that ten people were too many and that three more should be reduced; at the same time, the quality of workshop accountants should be strengthened so that each workshop has independent economic accounting. This would allow workshop directors to truly pay attention to and manage the economy, correcting the current phenomenon that all workshop cost accounting is concentrated in the sections, which is conducive to reducing costs. The opinions put forward by the masses during the blooming and contending, such as strengthening grassroots cadres, decentralizing management authority, eliminating infighting between departments, and strengthening the relationship between superiors and subordinates, were all resolved around the streamlining of organizations.

The state-owned Qinling Electric Factory is a new factory with a small number of skilled workers. However, before the rectification, the factory transferred a large number of skilled workers to the management departments. For example, of the factory's twelve eighth-grade workers, nine were working in the management departments, and there were also one hundred and thirty fifth- to seventh-grade skilled workers and eighty-four second- to fourth-grade skilled workers working in the management departments. Recently, based on the opinions of the masses, the leadership decided to streamline the management organizations at all levels in a bold manner and try to return technical personnel to their production posts as much as possible. During the in-depth discussion by mobilizing the masses, the masses came up with many good ways to streamline the organization. For example, the original establishment of the planning section was four groups with thirty cadres. The leadership proposed reducing seven people. After three discussions by all the cadres in the section, carefully calculating the workload and canceling the leadership at the group leader level within the section, the number of people could be reduced from thirty to nine. Finally, based on the opinions of the masses, the leadership formulated a streamlining plan, changing the original twenty-eight sections, fifteen workshops, and one independent section into eighteen sections and nine workshops. In this way, the management cadres will be reduced from the original 37.42% of the total number of employees to 9.87%. Now, the first batch of management cadres who have been transferred to lower levels have gone to their production posts.

In addition, many industrial and mining enterprises, such as the Northwest State-owned No. 4 Cotton Mill, the four factories under the Xinqin Company, and the factories and mines under the Tongchuan Mining Area, have formulated preliminary plans for streamlining the organizational structure and are either being discussed by the masses or are about to be submitted to the masses for discussion.

    陕西厂矿学习北京整风经验
    围绕紧缩机构改进工作
    本报西安23日电　学习北京厂矿整风经验，在大鸣大放以后先大改后大争，是目前陕西厂矿整风运动的特点。
    中共陕西省委和西安市委在国庆节前，分别召开各工业城市党委负责人、各大型厂矿党委书记座谈会，检查各厂矿的整风情况，要求各厂学习北京厂矿整风的经验，在10月15日以前，解决问题要达到职工提出的属于本单位能够解决的问题的50％。国庆节后，省市委负责领导工业的同志分头深入工厂进行具体领导，各厂普遍加紧改进工作，到15日，各工厂企业已经达到和超过省委提出的要求。陕西第一棉纺织厂已经达到90％。
    这一时期各厂矿的整改工作主要是以紧缩机构为中心，其他很多工作的改进，也围绕紧缩机构进行。很多厂还特别注意贯彻群众路线，充分发动群众反复讨论、补充和修正了初步拟定的紧缩方案。
    铁道部三桥车辆修理厂在鸣放高潮以后，党委就提出学习石景山钢铁厂的经验，以革命精神紧缩机构，同时，领导上并抽调专人，广泛搜集群众的意见，制订了紧缩机构的初步方案。方案中决定将现有十七个科室全部撤消，成立厂长办公室、总工程师办公室和一个行政福利科。方案中还规定将现有的十二个车间和一个直属班合并成七个车间。经过这样调整组织机构，就可以将全厂现有的四百十五个干部减少二百四十三个，这样干部占全体职工人数的比例将由22.1％降至9.2％。初步方案制订后，该厂就连续召开党委扩大会、党团员大会、职工代表大会、全体职工大会以及各种形式的座谈会，在会上对方案进行了热烈的讨论。争辩结果大家一致同意这个方案，同时，也提出很多补充和修正意见。如原来方案中计划厂长办公室放十个做计划、统计工作的干部，在讨论时有些人提出十个人太多，应该再减少三个；同时，加强车间会计员的质量，使每一个车间都有独立的经济核算，这样就可以让车间主任真正注意和管理经济，纠正现在车间成本核算全部集中在科室的现象，有利于降低成本。群众在鸣放中提出的加强基层干部、下放管理职权、消除各部门扯皮、密切上下关系等意见，都围绕着紧缩机构进行解决。
    国营秦岭电工厂是个技术工人本来不多的新厂。但是这个厂在整风以前，却把大批的技术工人调到管理部门去工作，如该厂共有十二个八级工人，就有九个在管理部门工作，在管理部门工作的还有五级到七级的技术工人一百三十人，二级到四级的技术工人八十四人。最近领导上根据群众意见，决心大刀阔斧地紧缩各级管理机构，尽量使技术人员回到生产岗位上去。在发动群众深入讨论中，群众想出很多紧缩机构的好办法。如计划科原编制是四个小组，三十个干部，领导上提出减少七个人，经过全科干部三次讨论，认真地核算了工作量，取消了科内组长一级的领导，就可以由三十个人减少到九个人。最后，领导上根据群众意见制订了精简方案，将原有的二十八个科室、十五个车间、一个独立段改成十八个科室九个车间。这样，管理干部将由原来占职工总数的37.42％降低到9.87％。现在，第一批下放的管理干部已经到生产岗位上去了。
    还有西北国棉四厂、新秦公司所属四个工厂，铜川矿区所属厂矿等不少工矿企业都制订出紧缩编制的初步方案，正在群众中讨论或即将拿到群众中讨论。
