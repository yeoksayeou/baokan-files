Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, October 27th. More than six hundred tractors from thirteen agricultural machine tractor stations in Anhui Province, distributed along the banks of the Huai River and the poldered areas along the Yangtze River, have been mobilized to help agricultural cooperatives rush plowing and planting. According to incomplete statistics, more than 540,000 mu of land have been planted, more than 600,000 mu have been harrowed, and more than 89,000 mu have been sown.

The land cultivated by tractors is generally very dry and hard, making it impossible to plow with old oxen and wooden plows. Many agricultural cooperatives, after receiving assistance from tractor stations for cultivation, concentrated their manpower to draw water to fight drought and planted wheat in a timely manner.

In the process of cultivation, each tractor station has taken various measures to ensure the quality of cultivation. The "August 1st" Tractor Station, established with donations from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, launched labor competitions between teams and between tractors, comparing speed, quantity, and quality. The Sucheng Tractor Station made full use of all the machines with the strongest soil crushing power, such as heavy harrow compactors and disc harrows.

    六百多台拖拉机一齐出动
    淮河两岸抢耕抢种
    新华社合肥27日电　安徽省分布在淮河两岸和沿长江圩区的十三个农业机器拖拉机站，出动六百多台拖拉机为农业社抢耕抢种。据不完全统计，已种地五十四万多亩，耙地六十多万亩，播种八万九千多亩。
    拖拉机代耕的田地，一般都是干硬得比较厉害，老牛木犁耕不动。许多农业社得到拖拉机站代耕帮助后，便集中人力提水抗旱，适时种上了小麦。
    各拖拉机站在代耕中，曾经采取各种措施，保证耕种质量。由中国人民解放军捐款建立的“八一”拖拉机站，开展了队和队之间、机车和机车之间的比速度、比数量、比质量的劳动竞赛。宿城拖拉机站把碎土力最强的重耙镇压器、圆盘耙等机具全部利用了起来。
