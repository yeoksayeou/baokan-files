　　Minister Ma Reads the Big-Character Posters
    The lunch bell rang, and comrades, holding bowls and chopsticks, surged towards the dining hall. They saw Minister Ma of the Organization Department of the Prefectural Committee reading big-character posters. I remember this was the third time he had been seen reading them. Among the red and green posters were several exposing his bureaucratic work style, criticizing his unhealthy organizational life, backlog of official documents and reports, loss of Party publications, and some problems in the promotion of cadres. While reading, he puffed heavily on his cigarette, and it seemed he was not feeling well. However, he kept nodding, looking around, and saying, "Good, very good, the criticism is correct, it should be criticized like this, the rectification campaign should be carried out fiercely, so that it can stimulate people to reform fiercely..." After a while, he said to a comrade, "I think a large number of comrades haven't used their brains to find the 'three evils'. Comrades who can write and draw are not diligent enough..." As he spoke, he went around to tables full of comrades eating, promoting and encouraging them. He said, "We must show a fighting spirit, everyone must use their brains, mouths and hands, and be determined to help the leadership in the rectification campaign, and at the same time improve ourselves in the movement. Let's push the rectification, the great blooming and contending, to a new high tide!" At this time, some comrades also began to discuss: "Look, Minister Ma has expressed his attitude and come to the dining hall to do in-depth mobilization, let's do it! Today we must write at least five sheets." "Hey! The Ministry of Industry has already put out several large editions, but we haven't seen any action from our Rural Work Department, it's too outrageous."
    A few days later, Minister Ma, based on the situation he understood in depth, convened a large meeting of cadres from the Prefectural and Special Directly Subordinate Organs Rectification Leadership Group, and made another mobilization. He explained the thoughts existing among the cadres, praised the units with better airing of views, and encouraged everyone to air their views more actively. He also admitted the shortcomings and errors initially revealed by the comrades, and expressed his intention to correct them immediately. He was writing a self-criticism for losing Party publications, and requested the organization to give him the deserved punishment.
    Now, the more than one hundred meters long corridors upstairs and downstairs of the Prefectural Committee office building are full of big-character posters, equivalent to ten times the original "Blooming and Contending Garden" in the dining hall. A "Rectification and Reform News" column has also been opened, and news of rectification and reform while working is being reported.

　　马部长看大字报
    午饭钟响了，同志们拿着碗筷涌向膳厅，看到地委组织部的马部长在读大字报。我记得他已是第三次在看了，在这一片红绿中间就有好几篇是揭露他的官僚主义作风，批评他组织生活不健全，积压公文、报告，丢失党刊，以及在提拔干部上的一些问题，他边读边猛吸着香烟，看样子，心情是不好受的。可是他却不断地点头，回顾左右，说：“好，很好，批评得对，就应该这样批评，整风就要狠狠的整，这样才能刺激人狠狠的改……。”一会儿又和这个同志说：“我看呀，还有很大部分的同志没有动脑筋去找‘三害’，能写能画的同志还不够勤快……。”说着说着，他竟绕到坐满一桌桌在吃饭的同志身边去宣传鼓动起来了。他说：“要拿出战斗的精神来，要大家动脑、动口又动手，下决心帮助领导整风，同时在运动中提高自己。把整风、大鸣大放推向一个高潮！”这时，有些同志也议论起来了：“你看，人家马部长已表示态度，又来到膳厅作深入动员了，干吧！今天起码写它个五张。”“喂！人家工业部已放了几大版了，总没见我们农村工作部的动静，太不像话了。”
    几天后，马部长又根据深入了解的情况，以地、专直属机关整风领导小组负责人身份，召集地委和群众团体的干部开大会再作动员，针对干部存在的思想，作了解释，并表扬了鸣放较好的单位，鼓励大家更积极地鸣放。他个人也承认同志们初步揭露出来的缺点和错误，并表示立即改正，对丢失党刊，正在写检讨，请求组织给予应得的处分。
    现在，地委办公大楼楼上楼下一百多公尺长的走廊两边已经贴满了大字报，相当于原来膳厅那片“鸣放园地”的十倍。还开辟了“整改消息”一栏，开始报道边整边改的消息了。
