Editorial:

    Today, the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, Jilin Dyestuff Plant, and Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant are beginning to be put into full or partial production. Our country's chemical industry is thus taking a step forward. The completion of these three large-scale, modern chemical industrial enterprises will not only supply the countryside with a large amount of chemical fertilizers and the people with a large amount of brightly colored, non-fading dyes, but also provide raw materials for the development of organic synthetic chemical industries such as synthetic fibers, plastics, and synthetic rubber. This will allow certain raw materials needed by other industrial sectors and certain daily necessities needed by the people to obtain new sources. Therefore, the completion of the Jilin Chemical Zone has a far-reaching impact on the development of the national economy, on meeting the needs of the people's lives, and on the development of the chemical industry itself. We express our warm congratulations on its birth and hope that our country's chemical industry will develop faster on this new foundation.

    The chemical industry is an industry with unlimited prospects. Its role in the national economy is becoming increasingly significant with the development of science and technology. The field of the chemical industry is extremely broad, including the chemical fertilizer industry, basic chemical industries such as acids, alkalis, inorganic salts, and pesticides, organic synthetic chemical industries such as plastics, synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, solvents, dyes, and paints, and the rubber industry, pharmaceutical industry, and other sectors, with a wide variety of products, with more than 10,000 currently produced in the world. It can manufacture a large number of products with various special properties from cheap raw materials and waste materials, replacing industrial raw materials such as ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, wood, cotton, leather, and natural rubber; it can also manufacture new synthetic raw materials that do not exist in nature. From the perspective of producing various chemical raw materials to supply other industrial sectors and agriculture, it is a heavy industry that produces means of production; from the perspective of processing and manufacturing various chemical products to supply people's consumption, it belongs to the scope of light industry that produces consumer goods. It must supply many raw materials to the heavy industry sector and also obtain various raw materials from the heavy industry sector. Therefore, the chemical industry has close relations with heavy industry, light industry, the national defense industry, agriculture, and all aspects of people's lives. From the perspective of modern industrial development trends, all industrialized countries develop the chemical industry at a relatively fast pace.

    The original foundation of China's chemical industry was extremely weak. Before liberation, only a few small processing plants were distributed in a few coastal cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin. As for the production quantity of chemical raw materials, it was even smaller, and most of the raw materials required for processing relied on imports. After liberation, after the period of national economic recovery and the construction of the first five-year plan, China's chemical industry has made great progress. As early as 1952, the output of many chemical products had exceeded the highest level in history. During the first five-year plan period, 33 chemical industrial plants and mines above the limit were built. The planned investment in basic construction of the chemical industry is expected to be completed at 112.6%, and the total output value of chemical enterprises under the Ministry of Chemical Industry has increased by about 30% on average each year. In 1957, the total output value of chemical enterprises under the Ministry of Chemical Industry is expected to be 361.3% of that in 1952. The output of major products such as chemical fertilizers, soda ash, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, and tires can be increased by about one to two times more than in 1952. The output of penicillin can be increased by more than 300 times that of 1952. The variety of chemical products has also increased rapidly. In 1952, China could only produce 460 kinds of chemical products. In 1957, the variety of chemical products nationwide is expected to increase to about 1,400 kinds.

    Although the chemical industry has developed rapidly in the past eight years, and the first five-year plan can be overfulfilled, China's chemical industry is still in a state of serious backwardness. From the perspective of output, with China's large population and large demand, chemical products should account for a considerable proportion of the world's total output, but in reality, the production level of several major products accounts for a very small proportion of the world's total output. China's chemical industry is far from meeting the needs of industry, agriculture, national defense, and people's lives. From the perspective of variety, the processing industry has developed considerably, but there are still very few varieties, especially the increase in high-end varieties is very slow, which is also far behind the needs of national economic development. Furthermore, from the perspective of the internal proportional relationship of the chemical industry, the raw material industry is still lagging behind the processing industry, and chemical raw materials have been in short supply year after year. The organic synthetic chemical industry is basically a blank spot, and most of the organic synthetic products required by the chemical industry itself cannot be solved by itself. Therefore, China's chemical industry cannot play a significant role in the development of the national economy.

    However, the chemical industry is very much needed for China, which has a large population, little arable land, and a backward economy. For example, one of the most effective ways to increase yield per unit area is to use chemical fertilizers. According to experiments in various places, taking ammonium sulfate, which has the lowest nitrogen content, as an example, each pound of it used can increase the production of rice by three to five pounds, or increase the production of seed cotton by one to 1.3 pounds. It can be seen that the development of the chemical fertilizer industry has extremely important significance for agriculture. For example, in order to develop chemical fibers to make up for the insufficient production of cotton, it is also necessary to develop the chemical industry.

    The completion of the Jilin Chemical Zone on the eve of the implementation of the second five-year plan will change the face of China's chemical industry during the second five-year plan period. Of course, the completion of these three chemical enterprises is only the first step in the journey of China's chemical industry making great strides forward; the task of developing the chemical industry facing us is still very arduous. To complete this task requires continued active cooperation from all parties. During the second five-year plan period, we must make the greatest efforts to develop the chemical fertilizer industry as quickly as possible to appropriately meet the urgent needs of agricultural production increase; we must make the greatest efforts to develop the synthetic fiber industry to partially alleviate the tight supply of cotton cloth. At the same time, we must appropriately develop basic chemical industries, organic synthetic chemical industries, rubber industries, and pharmaceutical industries, and strive to achieve basic self-sufficiency in other chemical products besides raw rubber during the second five-year plan period, and have different quantities of exports in many products. This is an inspiring goal to strive for and a heavy task placed in front of the chemical industry sector. The completion of the Jilin Chemical Zone has tested China's technical strength and proved that with the help of the Soviet Union and Soviet experts, we can completely build modern chemical enterprises. In particular, due to the realization of the first five-year plan, the metallurgical industry and the machinery industry have made great progress, and many materials and equipment for building chemical enterprises can be supplied domestically, and the conditions for actively developing the chemical industry are even more complete. Of course, this does not mean that there are no difficulties in developing the chemical industry. On the contrary, there are many difficulties. Developing the chemical industry is still a new issue for us, and we still lack experience; many new chemical industry sectors need to be built from scratch, and there will be many difficulties. Therefore, in actively developing the chemical industry, we must fully recognize the difficulties we face, think deeply, and proceed cautiously.

    Today, with the completion of the Jilin Chemical Zone, in addition to expressing our respect to the workers, engineering and technical personnel, and management cadres who built the Jilin Chemical Zone, and expressing our respect to the Soviet government and the Soviet experts who helped build the Jilin Chemical Zone, we also hope that the geological exploration personnel, design personnel, construction personnel, scientific research personnel, and production personnel in the chemical industry sector who have grown up in the construction and production of the Jilin Chemical Zone and other chemical industrial plants and mines will work harder to learn their skills and strive for the development of the chemical industry. All departments related to the development of the chemical industry must support the chemical industry sector and jointly build China's strong chemical industry.

    我们要建设强大的化学工业
    今天，吉林肥料厂、吉林染料厂和吉林电石厂三个企业开始全部或部分投入生产了。我国的化学工业由此向前迈进了一步。这三个规模巨大的、现代化的化学工业企业的建成，不仅将供给农村大量的化学肥料，供给人民大量色彩鲜艳，不会褪色的染料，而且还为发展合成纤维、塑料、合成橡胶等有机合成化学工业提供了原料，使得其他工业部门所需要的某些原料和人民生活所需要的某些日常用品可以获得新的来源。因此，吉林化工区的建成，对于发展国民经济，对于满足人民生活的需要，对于发展化学工业本身，都具有深远的影响。我们为它的诞生表示热烈的祝贺，并且希望我国的化学工业在这个新的基础上更快地向前发展。
    化学工业是一个前途无量的工业部门。它在国民经济中的作用，随着科学技术的发展而日益显著。化学工业的领域极其广阔，包括化学肥料工业，酸碱、无机盐类、农药等基本化学工业，塑料、合成纤维、合成橡胶、溶剂、染料、油漆等有机合成化学工业和橡胶工业，医药工业等部门，产品种类繁多，目前世界上生产的就有一万多种。它可以从廉价的原料和废料中制造大批具有各种特殊性能的产品，代替黑色金属、有色金属、木材、棉花、皮革、天然橡胶等工业原材料；也可以制造自然界还没有的新的合成原料。从生产各种化工原料供应其他工业部门和农业来讲，它是生产生产资料的重工业；从加工制造各种化学制品供应人民消费来说，它又属于生产消费资料的轻工业的范围。它既要供给重工业部门许多原料，又要从重工业部门取得各种原料。因此，化学工业同重工业、轻工业、国防工业、农业和人民生活的各个方面，都有密切的关系。从现代工业发展趋势来看，凡工业发达的国家无不以较快的速度来发展化学工业。
    我国化学工业原有的基础极其薄弱，解放前只有少数小型加工厂分布在上海、天津等几个沿海城市，至于化工原料的生产数量更少，加工所需要的原料大多仰赖进口。解放以后，经过国民经济恢复时期，经过第一个五年计划的建设，我国化学工业有了较大的发展。远在1952年，许多化工产品的产量即已超过了历史上的最高水平。第一个五年计划期间，兴建的限额以上的化学工业厂矿就有三十三个，化学工业的基本建设投资计划预计可以完成112.6％，化学工业部所属的化工企业生产总值平均每年就增长了约30％。1957年化学工业部所属化工企业的生产总值，预计为1952年的361.3％，化学肥料、纯碱、烧碱、硫酸、轮胎等主要产品的产量，都可以比1952年增加约一倍至二倍多。青霉素的产量更可以增长为1952年的三百多倍。化工产品的品种也增加得很快，1952年我国仅能生产四百六十种化工产品，1957年全国化工产品的品种预计可以增加到一千四百种左右。
    虽然八年来化学工业的发展很快，第一个五年计划可以超额完成，但是我国化学工业仍然处于严重的落后状态。从产量来看，以我国人口之多，需要量之大，化工产品应在世界总产量中占相当的比重，但实际上几种主要产品的生产水平在世界总产量中所占的比重极小。我国化学工业还远远不能满足工业、农业、国防和人民生活的需要。从品种来看，加工工业有相当的发展，但是品种还很少，特别是高级品种增加得很慢，也远远落后于国民经济发展的需要。再从化学工业内部的比例关系来看，原料工业仍然落后于加工工业，化工原料年年供不应求，有机合成化学工业更基本上是一个空白点，化学工业本身所需要的有机合成产品大部分也不能自己解决。因此我国化学工业在国民经济的发展中还不能发挥显著的作用。
    然而，化学工业对于人口多、耕地少、经济落后的我国却是非常需要的。比如，为了提高单位面积产量，最有效的办法之一，就是使用化学肥料。据各地的实验，拿含氮量最低的氮肥硫酸铵来说，每使用一斤，就可以增产水稻三斤至五斤，或增产子棉一斤至一点三斤。可见发展化学肥料工业，对于农业有着极其重大的意义。又比如，为了发展化学纤维，来弥补棉花产量的不足，这也需要发展化学工业。
    吉林化工区在第二个五年计划实施的前夜建成，将会使第二个五年计划期间我国化学工业的面貌改观。当然，这三个化工企业的建成，只是在我国化学工业大踏步前进的征途中迈出了第一步；摆在我们面前的发展化学工业的任务还十分艰巨。要完成这个任务还需要各方面继续积极的协作。在第二个五年计划期间，我们要尽最大的努力，以尽可能快的速度发展化学肥料工业，适当满足农业增产的迫切需要；要尽最大的努力发展合成纤维工业，部分地缓和棉布供应的紧张情况，同时要适当地发展基本化学工业、有机合成化学工业、橡胶工业、医药工业，争取在第二个五年计划期间除生胶以外，其他化工产品达到基本上自给自足，并在许多产品上有不同数量的出口。这是一个振奋人心的奋斗目标，也是一个摆在化学工业部门面前的繁重的任务。吉林化工区的建成，考验了我国的技术力量，证明在苏联和苏联专家的帮助之下，我们完全可以建设现代化的化工企业。特别是由于第一个五年计划的实现，冶金工业和机械工业有了很大的发展，许多建设化工企业的材料和设备可以由国内供应，积极发展化学工业的条件是更加完备了。当然，这并不是说发展化学工业就没有什么困难了。相反地，困难还很多。发展化学工业对我们说来还是一个新的问题，我们还缺乏经验；许多新的化学工业部门需要从无到有地建设起来，更会有重重困难。因此，我们在积极发展化学工业中，必须充分认识到面前的困难，深思熟虑，谨慎从事。
    在吉林化工区建成的今天，我们除了向建设吉林化工区的工人、工程技术人员、管理干部表示敬意，向苏联政府和帮助建设吉林化工区的苏联专家表示敬意之外，还希望在吉林化工区和其他化学工业厂矿的建设和生产中成长起来的化学工业部门的地质勘探人员、设计人员、施工人员、科学研究人员和生产人员更加努力地学会本领，为发展化学工业而奋斗。一切与发展化学工业有关的部门都要支援化学工业部门，共同建设我国强大的化学工业。
