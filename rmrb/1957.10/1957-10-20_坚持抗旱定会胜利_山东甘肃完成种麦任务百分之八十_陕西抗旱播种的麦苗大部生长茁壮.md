Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th: Shandong Province has planted wheat on over 50 million mu, accounting for over 80% of the planned planting area.

　　In order to strive to complete the wheat sowing plan in the shortest possible time, agricultural cooperatives in various places, while competing with each other, also launched mutual support activities. In the Liaocheng area, many agricultural cooperatives and production teams with better conditions, after completing their own sowing plans, strengthened field management on the one hand, and organized forces to support cooperatives and teams with poorer conditions in a rush to plant wheat on the other. In Chiping County, 345 production teams extracted a large number of laborers, livestock, and tools to support 63 teams that were more difficult, in order to rush to plant.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 19th: The winter wheat areas in the Jing, Wei, and Jialing River basins of Gansu Province have planted more than 8 million mu of winter wheat. At present, cadres and farmers in these areas are continuing to fight drought and rush to plant, with a total planting area of more than 10 million mu.

　　This year, all autumn planting areas in the province attach great importance to the quality of planting. Generally, the land is cultivated two or three times before planting, and the amount of fertilizer applied is also more than in previous years. Many counties have also trained planting experts. In the Pingliang area, the area with the most winter wheat planting in the upper reaches of the Jing River, farmers fought drought and rushed to plant during the planting period due to drought. Now they have planted more than 5.1 million mu, close to completing the planting plan. Some areas have recently had heavy rains, which can ensure complete emergence of seedlings. In the upper reaches of the Wei and Jialing Rivers, winter wheat on the mountains has also mostly been planted, and the plains are actively planting.

　　Xi'an Electric Report by our correspondent Zhu Bo: The drought-resistant wheat planting campaign in Shaanxi Province has achieved significant results. As of October 10, the province has planted a total of 17.58 million mu of wheat, accounting for about 75% of this year's planting plan. At present, from the Qinchuan Plain to the arid plateau, most of the planted wheat fields have grown strong seedlings.

　　Since the beginning of autumn, drought has appeared in various parts of Shaanxi, especially in the vast areas north of the Qinling Mountains and south of Yan'an. There has been little rain since September, which has brought great difficulties to autumn planting. For this reason, when preparing for autumn planting work in early September, the leading organs in various places paid attention to leading the work of fighting drought. All counties have transferred many cadres such as county party secretaries, county heads, and department heads to go deep into the grassroots to lead the masses in fighting drought. Most of the leading cadres and general staff in Huaxian and Xianyang counties went deep into the grassroots to work with the masses, and learned drought-resistant wheat planting methods from elderly farmers in the course of labor.

　　At present, the drought-resistant wheat planting campaign has been quickly and comprehensively launched throughout the province. In the canal irrigation areas on both sides of the Jing and Wei Rivers, farmers are irrigating day and night. Most of the agricultural cooperatives in counties such as Gaoling, Tongguan, Xianyang, and Liquan adopt the method of changing people and animals without stopping, irrigating wheat fields in two shifts day and night. According to statistics from Liquan, Gaoling and other counties, the quality of irrigation work is better than ever before. In the drought-resistant wheat planting work, various places have tried to find water sources, build small-scale water conservancy projects, and expand the area of irrigated land. For example, Guapo Township in Huaxian County expanded nearly 500 mu of irrigated land in more than 20 days. Xiaoguang No. 1 Cooperative in Dongzhao Township mobilized 300 people, and starting in early October, used the method of "measuring section by section, building section by section, and irrigating section by section" to build a canal that can irrigate more than 2,000 mu of land. Now, most of the land has been planted with wheat. Gaoling, Sanyuan, Xingping, Fuping, Liquan, Xianyang and other counties have mobilized the masses to dig wells or expand old canals, expanded the area of irrigated land, and ensured the completion of wheat planting tasks.

　　In the plateau areas, under the leadership of local cadres, agricultural cooperatives carried out meticulous land preparation to preserve soil moisture. According to inspections in Xingping, Sanyuan and other counties, dryland wheat fields have generally been repeatedly and carefully harrowed, so most wheat fields have preserved soil moisture and successfully completed the dryland wheat planting task.

　　In the drought-resistant wheat planting campaign, the masses in various places have come up with many effective drought-resistant methods. For example, farmers in Dali, Chaoyi and other places have created a water-drill planting method, which has excellent emergence. Farmers in Lintong, Sanyuan, Fuping and Xianyang counties also adopted this planting method. Other places have adopted the method of "hoeing dry and planting wet" to plant wheat (first use a hoe to remove a layer of dry soil, and then sow). In Chaoyi and other places, this method was used to plant wheat on many dry lands that could not be planted, and the emergence was very good.

　　According to personnel from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, there is confidence in completing this year's wheat planting task. At present, in addition to continuing to step up the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects to complete the entire wheat planting task, attention is also being paid to checking seedlings and replanting seedlings in dryland wheat fields.

　　坚持抗旱定会胜利
    山东甘肃完成种麦任务百分之八十
    陕西抗旱播种的麦苗大部生长茁壮
    新华社济南19日电  山东省已抗旱种麦五千多万亩，占计划播种面积的80％以上。
    为了力争在最短期间完成小麦播种计划，各地农业社在相互竞赛的同时，又展开了相互支援的活动。聊城专区有不少条件较好的农业社和生产队，在完成了自己的播种计划之后，一面加强苗期管理工作；一面组织力量，支援条件较差的社、队突击种麦。茌平县有三百四十五个生产队，抽出大批劳力、畜力和工具支援比较困难的六十三个队抢种。
    新华社兰州19日电  甘肃省泾、渭河和嘉陵江流域冬小麦地区已经播种八百多万亩冬小麦。目前，这些地区的干部和农民正在继续抗旱抢种中，共将播种一千多万亩。
    今年全省秋播地区，都比较重视播种质量。播种前一般都整地两三次，施肥量也比往年有所增加，很多县还训练了播种能手。全省种冬麦最多的泾河上游的平凉专区，播种期间由于干旱，农民们抗旱抢种，现在已种下五百一十多万亩，接近完成播种计划。有些地区最近下了大雨，可以保证出苗齐全。渭河和嘉陵江上游地区，现在山地冬小麦也大都播种完毕，平川地区正积极播种。
    本报西安电  记者朱波报道：陕西省抗旱种麦运动，已经获得显著成绩。全省截至10月10日为止，共播种小麦一千七百五十八万亩，约占今年播种计划的75％。目前，从秦川平原到干旱的高原，大部分播种的麦田，已经长出茁壮的麦苗。
    入秋以来，陕西各地就出现旱象，尤其是秦岭以北、延安以南的广大地区，9月以来很少落雨，给秋季播种带来很大困难。为此，各地领导机关在9月初准备秋播工作时，就注意了对抗旱工作的领导。各县都抽调了县委书记、县长、部科长等很多干部深入基层，领导群众抗旱。华县、咸阳等县绝大多数领导干部和一般工作人员深入基层，和群众一起进行劳动，并在劳动中向老年农民学习抗旱种麦的方法。
    目前，抗旱种麦运动已在全省很快全面展开。在泾河、渭河两岸的渠灌区，农民夜以继日地进行浇灌，高陵、潼关、咸阳、醴泉等县的大部分农业社，采用换人换畜不停车的办法，日夜两班浇灌麦田。据醴泉、高陵等县统计，浇灌工作的质量比过去任何时候都好。在抗旱种麦工作中，各地都多方寻找水源，建设小型水利工程，扩大水地面积。例如华县的瓜坡乡在二十多天里，就扩大了近五百亩水地。该县东赵乡晓光一社动员了三百人，从10月上旬起，用“节节测量，节节修建，节节浇灌”的办法，修了一道水渠，可灌溉二千余亩土地，现在，大部分土地都播种了小麦。高陵、三原、兴平、富平、醴泉、咸阳等县，都发动群众打井或扩建旧水渠，扩大了水浇地面积，保证了小麦播种任务的完成。
    在高原地区，各农业社在当地干部领导下，进行了细致的整地保墒。根据兴平、三原等县检查，旱地麦田，一般都进行了反复而又细致的耙耱，因此，大部分麦地都保住了墒，并顺利完成了旱地种麦任务。
    在抗旱种麦运动中，各地群众想了很多有效的抗旱办法。例如大荔、朝邑等地农民，创造了水耧播种的办法，出苗很好。采用这种播种办法的还有临潼、三原、富平和咸阳等县的农民。还有的地方采用了“耠干种湿”的办法播种小麦（先用耧耠去一层干土，然后再下种），朝邑等地用这种方法，把很多不能播种的旱地都播种了小麦，而且出苗情况很好。
    据省农业厅的人员说，完成今年的小麦播种任务是有把握的。目前除继续抓紧兴修小型水利工作完成全部种麦任务外，并注意旱地麦田的查苗补苗工作。
