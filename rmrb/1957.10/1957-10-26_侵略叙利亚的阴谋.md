    Conspiracy to Invade Syria
    Gu Si
    The invasion of Syria is imminent.
    Despite repeated warnings from peace-loving people all over the world, the United States is actively preparing to invade Syria, making the situation in the Middle East very tense recently, posing a serious threat to peace in the Middle East and the world.
    The United States once attempted to instigate the Arab countries surrounding Syria to oppose Syria, but this conspiracy did not succeed. Therefore, the United States placed its hopes on Turkey and Israel. According to the plan agreed upon by Turkey and the United States, after the Turkish elections on October 27, Turkey will launch a blitzkrieg along the Syrian-Turkish border from the Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates River, invading Syria and occupying Latakia with a portion of its forces, so that the US Sixth Fleet can enter the port. The main force of Turkey will go straight to Homs and the Syrian capital Damascus. The United States and its lackey Turkey attempted to quickly overthrow the Syrian government with this surprise attack, and prop up the Syrian puppet government now being organized in Turkey.
    In order to execute this plan, Turkey has concentrated a large number of troops on the Syrian border, including infantry, armored forces, tanks, artillery and aircraft, numbering up to 50,000. Turkish troops have already entered positions in this area, with American military personnel participating. Turkey also continues to create border incidents and send aircraft to intrude into Syrian airspace to provoke.
    Coordinating with Turkey's military preparations, the United States has rapidly shipped arms and ammunition to Turkey. The US Sixth Fleet, strengthened in September under the pretext of participating in "exercises," has concentrated in the Eastern Mediterranean, preparing to support Turkey. In order to threaten Syria and the Arab countries that may support Syria from the south, the United States, Britain, Turkey, and Pakistan's naval and air forces are preparing to hold so-called "exercises" in the Arabian Sea in November.
    This kind of war preparation by the United States and Turkey has aroused great indignation among the Syrian and Arab people. The Syrian people have actively participated in mass resistance organizations, received military training, and prepared to resist aggression. Egypt, in accordance with the joint defense treaty between Syria and Egypt, has sent its troops to support Syria. Many Arab countries have also stated that if Syria is invaded, they will support Syria.
    At the same time, the Soviet Union, the most reliable friend of the world's oppressed people, has repeatedly warned Turkey, stating that the Soviet Union cannot turn a blind eye to acts of aggression that undermine peace in the Middle East.
    However, the United States and Turkey continue to actively prepare for aggression, regardless of the will of the Syrian and Arab people and the warnings of the Soviet Union. US Secretary of State Dulles even openly emboldened Turkey, declaring that he would use force to support Turkey's aggression. With the approach of the Turkish elections, the US and Turkish aggression against Syria is imminent, thus making the situation in the Middle East critical.
    The United States obstructs the UN General Assembly from discussing Syria's complaint.
    In order to stop the aggression in time and maintain peace in the Middle East and the world, Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar wrote to the UN Secretary-General on the 16th, requesting the UN General Assembly to immediately discuss the "complaint against threats to the security of Syria and international peace" submitted by the Syrian delegation, and suggested that the UN General Assembly establish a committee to investigate the situation on the Syrian-Turkish border. This action by Syria immediately received the support of the Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, in a letter to UN General Assembly President Munro on the same day, exposed Turkey's war preparations to invade Syria, pointing out that Turkey's aggression against Syria would inevitably lead to the expansion of the conflict. Gromyko expressed the Soviet Union's support for Syria's proposal and suggested that if Turkey attacks Syria, UN member states should immediately provide Syria with the necessary armed assistance. Gromyko announced that the Soviet government declares that the Soviet Union is ready to send its own armed forces to participate in suppressing the aggressors and punishing the peacebreakers.
    Syria and the Soviet Union's firm will to stop aggression and defend peace has received the support of peace-loving people all over the world. In a telegram to Syrian President Kuwatly on the 17th, Chairman Mao Zedong of our country expressed the solemn position of the Chinese government and the Chinese people in firmly supporting the Syrian people's just struggle to defend independence and defend peace.
    Because the conspiracy to invade Syria has been thoroughly exposed, the United States is in a very embarrassing position. The United States is trying its best to put on a facade of innocence, claiming that it hopes the UN General Assembly will discuss the complaint filed by Syria, while continuing to slander the Soviet Union and Syria, making it seem that it is not Syria that is threatened with aggression, but Turkey that is threatened.
    However, the United States has a guilty conscience, fearing that the UN General Assembly's discussion will make the US conspiracy to invade Syria even more impossible to conceal, so it is doing everything possible to obstruct it. The UN General Assembly agreed on the 18th to immediately begin discussing Syria's complaint, but General Assembly President Munro announced that the debate would begin on a "convenient" day next week. As a result, the debate did not begin until the 22nd.
    Before the UN General Assembly debate began, the United States, with the support of Britain, carried out planning and arrangements. On the 20th, the propaganda machines of the United States and Britain relayed the news from the Mecca Radio Station in Saudi Arabia that Syria and Turkey had accepted the "mediation" proposal of Saudi Arabian King Saud. The United States and Britain immediately expressed their welcome. Turkey immediately announced its acceptance of the "mediation" and sent Minister of State Zorlu to Saudi Arabia. However, Syria immediately pointed out that this so-called mediation was not in accordance with the facts, because there was no conflict between Syria and Turkey, only Turkey's threat to Syria, so there was no question of "mediation." Syria still insisted on filing a complaint with the United Nations.
    After this "mediation" news came out, UN General Assembly President Munro announced that the UN General Assembly would meet on the 22nd to discuss Syria's complaint. At the beginning of the meeting on the 22nd, Turkey, at the instigation of the United States, demanded that the UN General Assembly postpone the discussion, using the excuse that Saudi Arabia was conducting "mediation" between Syria and Turkey. Turkey's request was firmly opposed by Syria and the Soviet Union. The Syrian representative pointed out that this was a conspiracy to confuse the public, the purpose of which was to undermine the UN General Assembly's discussion of Syria's complaint in order to conceal the current situation.
    However, US representative Lodge still insisted that the General Assembly should not take action until Saudi Arabia had conducted "mediation" between Turkey and Syria. The United States also instructed Paraguay to propose that the General Assembly adjourn indefinitely while Saudi Arabia was conducting "mediation." Due to Syria's opposition, the General Assembly decided to adjourn for only three days.
    The conspiracy to invade Syria is still underway.
    During this period, the United States, in collusion with Britain, continued to put pressure on Syria. Turkey still has no intention of withdrawing its troops from the Syrian border. The US propaganda machine has been heavily promoting the so-called "strength" of the Sixth Fleet assembled in the Eastern Mediterranean. US aircraft taking off from the Sixth Fleet have continuously intruded into Syrian airspace, as far as the Homs area north of Damascus. US Seventh Fleet Commander Bickley in the Western Pacific openly stated that he would support Turkey, and said that once the invasion of Syria began, the Seventh Fleet would "go directly to the back door of Suez." Israel's armored corps held large-scale exercises in order to coordinate. British warships also chose this time to visit Israel. At the same time, the United States also instructed NATO Secretary-General Spaak to clamor for support for Turkey's aggressive actions. Spaak went to the United States to discuss with the United States, and the United States is also discussing with British Prime Minister Macmillan the steps to invade Syria and other Arab countries.
    It is obvious that the US conspiracy to invade Syria has not only not been abandoned, but is still being actively carried out. Its current expression of support for Saudi Arabia's "mediation" is nothing more than a delaying tactic to paralyze world public opinion. Therefore, the situation in the Middle East remains very serious. Because the United States regards the invasion of Syria as an important step in maintaining its bankrupt "policy of strength," it has become even more frantic. All peace-loving people must continue to be vigilant and resolutely struggle against US aggression and for the maintenance of peace in the Middle East and the world.

### 侵略叙利亚的阴谋

    侵略叙利亚的阴谋
    顾思
    对叙利亚的侵略箭在弦上
    美国不顾全世界爱好和平人民的一再警告，积极准备侵略叙利亚，因而使得中东地区的局势最近非常紧张，形成了对中东和世界和平的严重威胁。
    美国曾经企图策动叙利亚周围的阿拉伯国家来反对叙利亚，但是这一阴谋并没有成功。于是美国就把希望寄托在土耳其和以色列身上。按照土耳其和美国商定的计划，在10月27日土耳其选举结束以后，土耳其将沿着从地中海到幼发拉底河的叙、土边界发动闪电式的进攻，侵入叙利亚，以一部分兵力侵占拉塔基亚，使美国第六舰队能够进入这个港口。土耳其的主力将直趋霍姆斯和叙利亚的首都大马士革。美国和它的走狗土耳其企图用这种出其不意的袭击，迅速推翻叙利亚政府，而将现在在土耳其境内组织的叙利亚傀儡政府扶植上台。
    为了执行这个计划，土耳其在叙利亚边境上集中了大量的军队，包括步兵、装甲部队、坦克、炮兵和飞机，为数达五万人。土耳其军队在这一带已经进入阵地，其中还有美国军事人员参加。土耳其并且不断制造边境事件，派飞机侵入叙利亚领空进行挑衅。
    配合着土耳其的军事准备，美国给土耳其迅速运去了军火弹药。在9月间以参加“演习”为名得到了加强的美国第六舰队，已集中在东地中海，准备支援土耳其。为了从南面威胁叙利亚和可能支持叙利亚的阿拉伯国家，美国、英国、土耳其、巴基斯坦的海空军准备在11月间在阿拉伯海举行所谓“演习”。
    美国和土耳其这种战争准备，引起了叙利亚和阿拉伯人民的极大愤慨。叙利亚人民纷纷参加群众抵抗组织，接受军事训练，准备抵抗侵略。埃及根据叙、埃两国的共同防御条约，派遣了自己的军队去支援叙利亚。许多阿拉伯国家也纷纷表示，如果叙利亚受到侵略，它们将支援叙利亚。
    同时，世界被压迫人民的最可靠的朋友苏联也一再向土耳其提出警告，表示苏联对于破坏中东和平的侵略行为不能置若罔闻。
    但是，美国和土耳其仍然不顾叙利亚和阿拉伯人民的意志和苏联的警告，继续积极进行侵略准备。美国国务卿杜勒斯并且公然给土耳其壮胆，声言要用武力支持土耳其的侵略。随着土耳其选举的迫近，美国和土耳其对叙利亚的侵略已经迫在眉睫，因而使中东局势达到了危急的地步。
    美国阻挠联大讨论叙利亚的控诉案
    为了及时制止侵略、维护中东和世界和平，叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在16日写信给联合国秘书长，要求联合国大会立即讨论叙利亚代表团提出的“对威胁叙利亚的安全和国际和平的控诉案”，并建议联合国大会成立一个委员会调查叙、土边境的情况。叙利亚这一个行动立即得到了苏联的支持。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在同一天给联合国大会主席孟罗的信中，揭露了土耳其侵略叙利亚的战争准备，指出土耳其对叙利亚的侵略将不能不引起冲突的扩大。葛罗米柯表示苏联支持叙利亚的建议，并且建议如果土耳其进攻叙利亚，联合国会员国应该立刻给叙利亚以必要的武装援助。葛罗米柯宣布，苏联政府声明，苏联准备派自己的武装部队参加镇压侵略者和惩罚和平破坏者。
    叙利亚和苏联这种制止侵略、保卫和平的坚决意志，得到了全世界爱好和平的人民的支持。我国毛泽东主席在17日给叙利亚总统库阿特利的电报中，表示中国政府和中国人民坚决支持叙利亚人民保卫独立、保卫和平的正义斗争的严正立场。
    由于侵略叙利亚的阴谋被彻底揭穿，美国已处于十分尴尬的地位。美国竭力装出一副清白无罪的面孔，宣称希望联合国大会讨论叙利亚提出的控诉，同时对苏联和叙利亚继续进行诬蔑，把事情说得似乎受到侵略威胁的不是叙利亚，而反倒是土耳其。
    然而美国作贼心虚，唯恐联合国大会的讨论将使美国侵略叙利亚的阴谋更加无法掩饰，因此竭力设法阻挠。联合国大会在18日同意立即开始讨论叙利亚的控诉案，但是大会主席孟罗却宣布在下一个星期的“方便的”日子开始辩论。结果，辩论直到22日才开始进行。
    在联大辩论开始以前，美国在英国支持之下进行了策划布置。20日，美国和英国的宣传机器转述了沙特阿拉伯的麦加电台的消息说，叙利亚和土耳其已经接受沙特阿拉伯国王沙特的“调停”建议。美国和英国立即表示欢迎。土耳其也马上宣布接受“调停”，并且派遣国务部长佐鲁前往沙特阿拉伯。但是叙利亚立即指出这种所谓进行调停的说法是不符合事实的，因为叙、土之间并无冲突，有的只是土耳其对叙利亚的威胁，所以谈不上“调停”。叙利亚仍然坚持向联合国提出控诉。
    在这个“调停”的消息传出以后，联大主席孟罗才宣布联大在22日开会讨论叙利亚的控诉案。22日大会一开始，土耳其在美国怂恿之下，就以沙特阿拉伯在叙、土两国之间进行“调停”为借口，要求联大延期讨论。土耳其的要求遭到叙利亚和苏联的坚决反对。叙利亚代表指出，这是一个混淆视听的阴谋，其目的是要破坏联大对叙利亚控诉案的讨论，以便掩饰目前的局势。
    但是美国代表洛奇却仍然主张等到沙特阿拉伯在土耳其和叙利亚之间进行“调停”以后，大会才采取行动。美国还指使巴拉圭提议大会在沙特阿拉伯进行“调停”时无限期休会。由于叙利亚的反对，大会才决定只休会三天。
      侵略叙利亚的阴谋仍在进行
    在这期间，美国串通英国继续对叙利亚施加压力。土耳其仍然毫无从叙利亚边境撤退军队之意。美国宣传机器大肆宣传集结在地中海东部的第六舰队的所谓“实力”。从第六舰队起飞的美国飞机不断侵入叙利亚领空，直到大马士革以北霍姆斯一带。在西太平洋的美国第七舰队司令比克利公开表示要支持土耳其，并且说一旦对叙利亚的侵略开始，第七舰队将“直接开往苏伊士的后门”。以色列的装甲兵团举行了大规模演习，以为策应。英国军舰也选择这个时机访问以色列。同时，美国又指使北大西洋集团秘书长斯巴克叫嚣要支持土耳其的侵略行动。斯巴克并前往美国同美国商量，而美国也正同英国首相麦克米伦商量侵略叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家的步骤。
    很明显，美国侵略叙利亚的阴谋不但没有放弃，而且仍在积极进行。它目前表示支持沙特阿拉伯进行“调停”的做法，不过是一种麻痹世界舆论的缓兵之计。因此，中东的局势仍然十分严重。由于美国把侵略叙利亚看作是维持它的破产了的“实力政策”的重要步骤，所以它就更加疯狂。一切爱好和平的人民必须继续保持警惕，为反对美国侵略、维护中东和世界和平而坚决斗争。
