Xinhua News Agency report: United Press Tokyo correspondent Dibble said in a dispatch on the 7th that the reaction of the Asian people to the Soviet Union's successful launch of the first artificial satellite showed that they "were happy that the United States, which had long appeared in the international arena as a 'superman,' had been defeated in its 'forte' of technology."

This American reporter believes that Asia's reaction can be "frankly" summarized as: "America's prestige has suffered a heavy blow." Or, as a Japanese housewife said: "America has lost face."

Dibble also said that Asians, including the shoe-shine boys in Tokyo's Hibiya Park, were happy about the Soviet Union's major scientific achievement.

American military commentator Lippmann also said that the United States is currently most afraid that the success of the Soviet artificial satellite launch will lead the neutral countries of Asia and Africa to believe that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system, thus posing a "threat" to the United States.

    美国丢了脸
    合众社记者看亚洲反应
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：合众社驻东京记者迪布尔7日在他发出的一则消息中说，在亚洲人民对苏联发射第一个人造卫星成功这件事的反应中可以看出，他们“对于长久以来在国际间以‘超人’姿态出现的美国在它‘拿手’的技术方面败北而感到高兴”。
    这位美国记者认为，可以把亚洲的反应“率直地”总结为：“美国的威信遭到了沉重的打击”。或者像一位日本的家庭妇女所说的：“美国丢了脸”。
    迪布尔还说，亚洲人包括东京日比谷公园的擦皮鞋小孩在内都对苏联的这一科学上的重大成就感到高兴。
    美国军事评论家立夫曼也说，美国目前最怕的是由于苏联人造卫星发射成功而使亚非的中立国家相信社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越，从而构成对美国的一种“威胁”。
