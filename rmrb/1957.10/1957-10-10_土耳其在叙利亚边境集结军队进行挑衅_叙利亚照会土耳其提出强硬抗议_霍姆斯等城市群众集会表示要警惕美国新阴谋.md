Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 9th: Syrian Acting Foreign Minister Kalas said on the 8th that the Syrian government has sent a note to the Turkish government lodging a strongly worded protest against Turkey's troop build-up and provocative actions on the Syrian border.

He said that the Syrian government had also telegraphed Foreign Minister Bitar, who is in New York attending the United Nations General Assembly, instructing him to take necessary action on the issue within the United Nations General Assembly.

Kalas pointed out that the situation on the border is very serious, as Turkey is continuing to amass troops for no reason. Turkish troops have twice fired on Syrian border residents in the past two days.

The Syrian cabinet held a meeting on the morning of the 8th, presided over by President Kuwatly, to discuss the current situation.

On the same afternoon, Acting Foreign Minister Kalas held an emergency meeting with the Egyptian Ambassador to Syria, informing the Egyptian Ambassador of the actions Syria would take to deal with Turkish provocations.

According to a bulletin from the Syrian News Agency, Syrian political figures, commenting on Khrushchev's warning to Western countries and Turkey on the 8th, said that the West must think deeply about every step it will take in the Middle East. These figures said that the Soviet Union's successful launch of artificial satellites is a warning to imperialism, its military treaties, bases, and those who serve them.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: New York dispatch: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 8th, accusing Turkey of threatening peace in the Middle East.

Bitar requested that the letter be circulated in the United Nations General Assembly, because, according to the United Nations Charter, member states have the right to bring events threatening international peace to the attention of the United Nations General Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 9th: Many cities in Syria, including Homs and Latakia, held mass rallies this week to condemn the recent U.S. conspiracies.

Speakers and participants at the meetings stated that they supported the government's policy of adhering to national independence. They believed that the unity between the people and the army could defeat any aggression. Speakers called on residents to participate in popular resistance organizations and be vigilant against new U.S. conspiracies against Syria.

They thanked the Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving countries for their support in Syria's struggle against imperialism.

    新华社大马士革9日电　叙利亚代理外交部长卡拉斯8日说，叙利亚政府已经照会土耳其政府，就土耳其在叙利亚边境集结军队以及进行挑衅的行动提出措词强硬的抗议。
    他说，叙利亚政府也已经打电报给正在纽约出席联合国大会的外交部长比塔尔，指示他在联合国大会内就这个问题采取必要的行动。
    卡拉斯指出，由于土耳其正在毫无理由地继续集结军队。土军在过去两天中曾经两次向叙利亚边境居民射击，边境局势非常严重。
    叙利亚内阁8日上午在库阿特利总统主持下举行会议，讨论了目前局势。
    同一天下午，代理外交部长卡拉斯同埃及驻叙利亚大使举行了紧急会谈，他把叙利亚为对付土耳其挑衅而将要采取的行动通知了埃及大使。
    据叙利亚新闻局公报报道，叙利亚政界人士在评论赫鲁晓夫8日对于西方国家和土耳其提出的警告时说，西方对于它将在中东走的每一步必须深思。这些人士说，苏联发射人造卫星成功，是对于帝国主义、它们的军事条约、基地以及为它们效劳的人的警告。
    据新华社9日讯　纽约消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔8日写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，指责土耳其在威胁中东和平。
    比塔尔要求把这封信在联合国大会中散发，因为根据联合国宪章，会员国有权把威胁国际和平的事件提请联合国大会注意。
    新华社大马士革9日电　叙利亚的霍姆斯、拉塔基亚等许多城市在这个星期举行了群众大会，谴责最近美国的阴谋。
    发表演说的人和参加会议的群众都表示，他们支持政府坚持民族独立的政策。他们相信，人民和陆军之间的团结能够击败任何侵略。演说者号召居民们参加人民抵抗组织，警惕美国对叙利亚的新阴谋。
    他们感谢苏联、中国和其他爱好和平的国家在叙利亚反对帝国主义的斗争中所给予的支持。
