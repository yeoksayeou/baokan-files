According to the Gansu Daily news, recently, cadres from the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League (CYL) organs, the CYL newspaper, and the CYL school have been requesting their organizations to approve them to go to the grassroots level in the first batch to participate in physical labor.

The Standing Committee of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CYL, based on the spirit of the decision of the Central Committee of the CYL and in light of the situation of the cadres of its subordinate units, studied specific implementation opinions on September 26. At the meeting, everyone analyzed the current situation of CYL cadres in agencies, factories, mines, and schools above the county level in the province. In response to these circumstances, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CYL initially decided to organize cadres of CYL above the county level in batches within seven years to participate in physical labor in rural areas and factories, to train for one to two years, obtain the qualifications of farmers and workers, and then serve as CYL cadres.

On October 8, the Standing Committee of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CYL held its second meeting and approved the requests of twenty comrades, including Xu Xing, Secretary-General of the Provincial Committee of the CYL, Sang Xingxiang, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department, Li Qun, Deputy Minister of the Youth and Agriculture Department, and Ge Zhida, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Gansu Youth Daily, to go down to participate in labor and training in the first batch. These comrades will form four groups and go to several agricultural cooperatives in counties such as Hua Chi (old revolutionary base area), Dingxi (arid area), Anxi (windy and sandy area), and Wudu (mountainous area) to work. The comrades who were approved made a guarantee to the Party in big-character posters: Go to the countryside, go to labor, train yourselves, and transform yourselves.

On October 10, Huo WeiDe, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Standing Committee members Wang Bingxiang, Li Peifu, Li Zhengtin, and Secretary-General Wan Liangcai met with them. Comrade Huo Weide earnestly told them: Although the number of people going to the countryside this time is small, it sets an example for the young intellectuals of the whole province to participate in physical labor. The countryside is a rich treasure trove of knowledge, you must study hard. The Standing Committee members of the Provincial Party Committee also pointed out that this action is a great action to change customs; this training is glorious, and the process of training is also the process of transforming and improving oneself. You must have a firm determination to overcome all difficulties until you achieve victory.

The Standing Committee of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CYL put forward specific requirements for the comrades who went down to participate in labor and training: Actively labor, train yourselves, and strive to obtain the qualifications of farmers within one to two years; generally, you should achieve labor days equivalent to those earned by intermediate labor. Within six months of being sent down, do not take on any leadership work in the township or cooperative. Frequently contact the local CYL committee, especially the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CYL, and actively report on your labor, study, work, and ideological situation.

　　团甘肃省委领导干部下乡当农民
    据甘肃日报消息　近日来，共青团甘肃省委机关、团报、团校的干部，纷纷要求组织批准自己，第一批到基层去参加体力劳动。
    团省委常委会根据团中央决定精神，结合所属单位干部情况，在9月26日研究了具体执行的意见。会上大家就当前全省县以上机关、厂矿、学校团的干部情况作了分析。针对这些情况，团省委初步决定在七年以内分期分批组织县以上机关团的干部到农村、工厂参加体力劳动，锻炼一、二年，取得农民、工人资格，再做团的干部。
    10月8日，团省委常委会第二次开会，研究批准了团省委秘书长徐行，组织部副部长桑兴祥、青农部副部长李群、甘肃青年报副总编戈治达等二十个同志的要求，第一批下去参加劳动锻炼。这些同志将组成四个组分赴华池（老区）、定西（干旱区）、安西（风沙区）、武都（山区）等县的几个农业社劳动。被批准了的同志用大字报向党提出保证：到农村去，到劳动中去，锻炼自己改造自己。
    10月10日，中共甘肃省委书记霍维德，常委王秉祥、李培福、李正廷及秘书长万良才同志接见了他们。霍维德同志恳切地告诉他们说：这一次下乡人数虽然少，但是给全省的知识青年参加体力劳动树立了榜样。农村是丰富的知识宝库，你们要好好学习。省委常委们也指出，这一行动是伟大的移风易俗的行动；这个锻炼是光荣的，锻炼的过程也就是改造和提高自己的过程，要有克服一切困难的坚强决心，直到取得胜利。
    对下去参加劳动锻炼的同志，团省委常委会向他们提出了具体要求：积极劳动，锻炼自己，争取在一年至二年内取得农民资格；一般应做到相当于中等劳力所得的劳动日。在下放半年之内，不担任乡、社任何领导工作。经常地和当地团委取得联系，特别是和团省委联系，主动地汇报自己的劳动、学习、工作、思想情况。
