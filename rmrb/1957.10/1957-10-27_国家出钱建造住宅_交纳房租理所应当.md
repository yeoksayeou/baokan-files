    The State Pays to Build Housing, Paying Rent is a Matter of Course

    After reading Yu Wenyuan's big-character poster, one is truly angered. It is true that our happiness today was bought with the blood of countless martyrs; but when they were shedding their blood and sacrificing their lives, what were you, Yu Wenyuan, doing? Cooking for the Japanese devils, checking household registrations in Xizhimen, acting as a puppet police officer. You yourself said: you didn't even like eating ordinary stir-fried dishes in the past, only eating the best; but when you were "only eating the best," the old workers couldn't even get coarse corn buns, and were constantly beaten and cursed. Such dark days have disappeared forever only under the leadership of the Communist Party. Who is it that still wants the workers to live those poor days, who is it that doesn't act like a member of the working class? Isn't this obvious?

    Regarding the workers' rent issue, the opinion of the comrade signed "Representative" completely represents the interests of the working class. The houses are built with the state's money, and workers should pay rent according to the state's regulations. Rent subsidies are unreasonable and should be abolished!

    国家出钱建造住宅
    交纳房租理所应当
    于文元所写的大字报，读后真正令人气愤。不错，我们今天的幸福，正是无数先烈的鲜血换来的；但是，当他们抛头颅，洒鲜血的时候，你，于文元，在干什么呢？在给日本鬼子做饭，在西直门检查户口，当伪警察。你自己说：你过去连炒菜都不爱吃，尽吃好的；可是当你“尽吃好的”时候，老工人连窝窝头都吃不上，还得经常挨打受骂。这样的黑暗日子，只有在共产党领导之下，才一去不复返了。究竟是谁还想叫工人过那些穷苦的日子，究竟是谁不像工人阶级中的一员？这还不明显吗？
    关于工人的房租问题，署名“代表”同志的意见，是完全代表了工人阶级的利益的。房子是国家拿钱盖的，工人住房子就应该按国家的规定交房钱。房贴是不合理的，应该取消！
