Xinhua News Agency: Sichuan Province has achieved success in hookworm disease prevention and treatment. Since the large-scale hookworm disease prevention and treatment work was launched in Sichuan Province in early 1956, more than 2.4 million hookworm disease patients have recovered their health. Among them, about 12,000 severely ill patients who had lost their ability to work have also regained their ability to work and have joined in production.

The health department of Sichuan Province has resolutely implemented the central government's "actively prevent and treat" policy, and in the past two years has adopted comprehensive prevention and treatment measures for hookworm disease, including fecal management to kill insect eggs, personal protection, and treatment of patients. At the same time, they united traditional Chinese and Western medicine, using joint clinics as the core, and absorbed scattered private practitioners to participate in eliminating hookworm disease by dividing into groups and areas. These methods cost less money, saved cadres, accomplished more, and had greater effects. In addition, attention was paid to strengthening publicity and fully mobilizing the masses.

Medical science workers in Sichuan Province have conducted some research on the prevention and treatment of hookworm disease, which has improved prevention and treatment technology. Wen Hanchang, deputy director of the Sichuan Provincial Health Research Institute, has improved the tetrachloroethylene therapy for hookworm disease, changing tetrachloroethylene pills to a liquid form and eliminating the need for laxatives, even for patients with mixed hookworm and roundworm infections, there is no need for deworming agents. This method has the same therapeutic effect as the original method, and in past trials, it has saved the country more than 700,000 yuan in funds. Professor Wang Zhengyi of Sichuan Medical College has also achieved certain results in the research on hookworm disease prevention technology and the patterns of hookworm infection among Sichuan farmers.

At present, Sichuan Province has arranged the tasks for hookworm disease prevention and treatment this winter and next spring. All localities are required to seize the favorable conditions of the winter and spring seasons when agricultural work is relatively free, other infectious diseases are reduced, and a large number of hookworm eggs and larvae in the soil die overwinter, to actively carry out prevention and treatment work.

    四川省防治钩虫病工作有成绩
    二百多万患者恢复了健康
    据新华社讯　四川省自1956年初展开大规模的钩虫病防治工作以来，到现在已经有二百四十多万名钩虫病患者，恢复了健康。其中，约一万二千多名曾经丧失了劳动能力的重病人，也恢复了劳动能力，参加了生产。
    四川省卫生部门坚决贯彻中央提出的“积极防治”的方针，两年来对防治钩虫病采取了粪便管理杀虫卵、个人防护和治疗患者的综合性防治等措施；同时团结中西医，以联合诊所为核心，吸收散在民间开业医生参加，分组划片消灭钩虫病。这些办法花钱少，省干部，办事多，效果也大。此外，还注意了加强宣传和充分发动群众。
    四川省的医学科学工作者对钩虫病的防治进行了一些研究，使防治技术有了改进。四川省卫生研究所副所长文汉长等改进了钩虫病四氯乙烯疗法，将四氯乙烯丸改为液剂，并不用泻剂，对一般钩虫和蛔虫混合感染患者也不用驱虫剂。这种办法，治疗效果完全和原法一样，而且在过去试行中，已经为国家节省了七十多万元资金。四川医学院教授王正仪教授对钩虫病的预防技术和四川农民感染钩虫病的规律的研究，也获得了一定的成绩。
    目前，四川省已安排了今冬明春钩虫病防治工作的任务。要求各地抓紧冬春季节农事较空闲、其它传染病减少、土壤内钩虫卵和幼虫越冬大量死亡的有利条件，积极开展预防治疗工作。
