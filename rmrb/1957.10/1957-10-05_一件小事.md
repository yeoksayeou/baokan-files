    A Small Matter
    Shi Yan
    One day in July, the grain sales department of Korla County, Xinjiang, issued a notice: Starting today, the sales department will sell 50% coarse grains in combination with fine grains. After this news spread, the masses discussed it heatedly. Some said that the cadres had eaten all the wheat; others pestered Wang Xinfang, the director of the sales department, insisting on buying only fine grains.
    In order to clarify some incorrect understandings, Director Wang patiently explained to the masses: "The statement that cadres have eaten all the wheat is completely unfounded. The government treats the masses and cadres the same, and there is absolutely no favoritism. You can visit the cadres' meals." Some people disbelievingly said, "Your words sound very nice, but I don't believe that someone like you, a director, can eat coarse grains?" A comrade then said, "Director Wang not only can eat coarse grains, but has been eating them since April."
    The masses were always skeptical when they heard that Director Wang also ate coarse grains. One morning, some people took advantage of Director Wang's mealtime and pushed the door open. What was Director Wang eating? On the table were corn buns, in the bowl was corn porridge, and the bag was full of corn flour. Facts speak louder than words, and another round of discussion was stirred up among the masses: "Director Wang really eats coarse grains! To say that 'cadres have eaten all the wheat' is just blatant lying." From then on, the masses' objections to the supply of coarse grains gradually disappeared.

    一件小事
    石燕
    7月的一天，新疆库尔勒县粮食门市部发出了一项通知：从今天开始，门市部要搭配50％的粗粮出售。这道消息传出后，群众议论纷纭。有的说，小麦都叫当干部的吃了；有的人就纠缠着门市部主任王心芳，非全部卖给他们细粮不可。
    王主任为了澄清一些不正确的认识，就耐心地向群众解释：“小麦都叫干部吃了的说法是没有任何根据的。政府无论对群众或干部都是一样的，绝无厚此薄彼。你们可以去参观一下干部的伙食。”有的群众不相信地说：“话说得倒怪好听，我就不信像你这当主任的还能吃粗粮？”有一个同志接着说：“王主任不但能吃粗粮，而且从4月起一直吃到现在。”
    群众听说王主任也吃粗粮，心里总是将信将疑。一天早晨，有些人趁着王主任吃饭的时候，推门进去了。王主任吃的是什么呢？桌子上摆的玉米窝窝头、碗里盛的玉米稀饭，面袋里装的全是玉米面。事实胜于雄辩，群众中又引起了一番议论：“王主任真的吃粗粮啊！‘小麦都叫当干部的吃了’，那才是睁着眼睛在说瞎话哩。”从此以后，群众对供应粗粮的意见渐渐消除了。
