    Settling Down in the Borderland
    Zeng Zhao'an
    Jumping off the bus, grabbing a handful of soil,
    Discarding the dirt, pulling a blade of grass,
    Seeing if it resembles the soil of my hometown?
    Seeing if it resembles the grass of my hometown?
    Turning it over and over, looking again and again,
    It is still no different from the soil of my hometown!
    Chewing and chewing, tasting again and again,
    It is still as fragrant as the grass of my hometown!
    Finding an old man to ask for directions,
    Seeking an old woman to beg for a bowl of water,
    Seeing if he resembles the people of my hometown?
    Tasting if it resembles the water of my hometown?
    Asking and asking, my throat is hoarse,
    Every person has a diligent, smiling face!
    Begging and begging, my stomach is full,
    Every bowl of water is clear and cool!
    I quickly arrange my home,
    Digging a pit with both hands,
    Putting the red beans from the South,
    Along with my heart, planting them on this wilderness.

    塞外落户
    曾昭安
    跳下汽车，抓一把土，
    丢掉泥巴，拔一根草，
    看看它像不像家乡土？
    看看它像不像家乡草？
    翻来复去，瞧了又瞧，
    它还是和乡土没有两样！
    咬来咬去，尝了又尝，
    它还是和乡草一样芳香！
    找位老大爷问路，
    寻位老大娘讨碗水，
    看看他像不像故乡人？
    尝尝它像不像故乡水？
    问来问去，嗓子都哑了，
    个个人都是勤咀笑脸！
    讨来讨去，肚子都涨了，
    碗碗水都是明澈清凉！
    我赶快安排好我的家，
    用双手挖了一个坑，
    把来自南国的红豆，
    连同我的心种在这荒野上。
