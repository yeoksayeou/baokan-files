    China's First High-Head Hydropower Station Begins Construction
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, October 1st. The third-stage power station of the Yili River Hydropower Station, China's first high-head power station, officially began construction today.
    The third-stage power station is one of the main projects of the Yili River. It has an installed capacity of 144,000 kilowatts, more than twice the total capacity of the Shizitan Hydropower Station. With a head of 650 meters, it is currently the power station with the highest head in China.
    The Yili River Hydropower Station is also the first cross-basin hydropower station in China. The Jinsha River and the Yili River run parallel to each other for a long distance, with a water surface drop of 1,350 meters between the two rivers. The Yili River Hydropower Station utilizes this drop to generate electricity. The third-stage power station is being built underground between the two rivers.
    Prior to this, the second-stage power station of the Yili River Power Station started construction in July last year and is now under intensive construction.

    我国第一座高水头电站开工
    新华社昆明1日电  我国第一座高水头电站——以礼河水电站的第三级电站，今天正式开工兴建。
    三级电站是以礼河的主体工程之一，装机容量十四万四千瓩，比狮子滩水电站的总容量大一倍多。水头六百五十公尺，是目前我国水头最高的电站。
    以礼河水电站又是我国第一座跨流域开发的水电站，金沙江和以礼河有很长一段上下平行着奔流，两河之间的水面落差达一千三百五十公尺，以礼河水电站就是利用这个落差来发电的。三级电站正设在两河之间的地下。
    在此以前，以礼河电站的二级电站，已在去年7月开工，现在正在加紧建设中。
