Xinhua News Agency, October 18th: According to TASS reports, the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the socialist parties of Western European countries regarding the issue of safeguarding peace in the Middle East has aroused widespread attention and commentary in Western Europe.

	France's "l'Aurore" quoted a statement from the chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, saying that the meeting of socialist parties of Western European countries to be held in Strasbourg on October 20 will discuss the letter from the CPSU Central Committee.

	France's "Le Monde" said in its commentary that the suggestions put forward in the letter from the CPSU Central Committee of "renouncing the use of force and implementing an arms embargo are very wise."

	Some right-wing newspapers expressed dissatisfaction with the letter from the CPSU Central Committee. "l'Humanité" commented that this situation is not accidental. Reactionary groups are trying with all their might to oppose the establishment of contact between communist parties and socialist parties, because such contact is conducive to preventing the danger of war and strengthening peace.

	British newspapers continued to publish commentaries on the 17th. Some bourgeois newspapers openly reversed black and white, attempting to make it appear as if it was the Soviet Union, rather than the Western countries led by the United States, that had created the tense situation in the Middle East.

	A well-known Labor Party figure, Ford, the editor of the "Tribune" weekly, published an article in the "Daily Herald," severely criticizing some people for attempting to divert everyone's attention away from the suggestion in the letter from the CPSU Central Committee regarding a joint statement by major powers not to use force in the Middle East to resolve disputes.

	Norway's "Friheten" wrote in an editorial on the 17th that the letter from the CPSU Central Committee is a call to the entire workers' movement, urging them to be vigilant against the forces of war. The newspaper said that the current situation in the Near East contains serious dangers to world peace.

　　苏共中央致各国社会党的信件
    受到西欧舆论注意
    据新华社18日讯  据塔斯社报道：苏联共产党中央委员会就保卫中近东和平问题给西欧各国社会党的信在西欧引起广泛的注意和评论。
    法国“震旦报”援引西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔的声明说，10月20日在斯特拉斯堡召开西欧国家社会党会议，将讨论苏共中央的信。
    法国“世界报”在评论中说，苏共中央信里提出的“放弃使用武力和对武器施行禁运的建议是非常明智的”。
    某些右翼报纸对苏共中央的信表示不满。“人道报”评论指出，这种情况并不是偶然的。反动集团企图用一切力量反对共产党和社会党建立接触，因为这种接触有助于防止战争危险和加强和平。
    英国各报17日继续发表评论。某些资产阶级报纸公然颠倒黑白，企图把事情说成好像是苏联而不是以美国为首的西方国家，在中近东造成了紧张局势。
    工党著名人士、“论坛”周报编辑福特在“每日先驱报”上发表文章，严厉斥责有些人企图转移大家的视线，不去注意苏共中央的信中提出的关于大国发表不在中近东使用武力来解决争端的联合声明的建议。
    挪威的“自由报”17日在社论中写道，苏共中央的信是对整个工人运动的号召，要他们警惕战争势力。报纸说，目前近东的局势对世界和平包含着严重的危险性。
