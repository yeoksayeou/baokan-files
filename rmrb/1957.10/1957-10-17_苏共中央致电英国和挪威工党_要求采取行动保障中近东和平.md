Xinhua News Agency, October 16th. TASS reported on the 15th that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sent similarly worded telegrams to the Executive Committee of the British Labour Party and the Central Committee of the Norwegian Labour Party, requesting them to take necessary measures to prevent aggression against Arab countries and safeguard peace in the Middle East.

The telegram from the CPSU Central Committee to the British Labour Party stated that the extremely serious and dangerous situation currently prevailing in the Middle East, particularly in the Syrian region, is causing anxiety among the broad masses of people in all countries. Foreign troops are gathering on the Syrian border. In the eastern Mediterranean, not far from the Syrian coast, warships of the US Sixth Fleet are concentrating. US officials and military leaders have made provocative, fabricated, and threatening belligerent statements against Syria. Certain national leaders of Turkey, filled with adventurous sentiments and fantasizing about restoring Turkish rule over the Arab peoples, have also made similar statements. Under the protection of the Turkish authorities, Syrian reactionary fugitives are converging in Istanbul, attempting to play the role of a "Syrian government" relying on the bayonets of foreign interventionists. There are constant attempts to set Arab countries against each other and to incite fratricidal wars of Arabs against Arabs.

The telegram pointed out that the main reason for the dangerous escalation of the situation in the Near East is the desire of large oil monopolies, primarily US oil monopolies, to ensure their unlimited dominance in the Middle East region. They are dissatisfied with the current democratic government of Syria because it pursues an independent national policy and does not wish to join the aggressive Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine, and because Syria and Egypt are waging a courageous and selfless struggle to defend the rights of the Arabs and oppose colonialist aggression. The schemers intend to deal with independent Egypt after Syria, and then to defeat other Arab countries, both republics and monarchies, that have gained independence since the war.

The telegram then exposed and refuted the absurd propaganda of some US and Western leaders about the so-called "communist danger" in order to conceal the planned aggression against Syria.

The telegram stated that Syria is not isolated in its struggle against aggression. The Egyptian government has stated that if Syria is attacked, Egypt will support Syria without limitations. Many other Arab countries have also expressed their support for an independent Syria. Other peace-loving people in all countries stand with Syria, especially the Soviet Union, which cannot remain indifferent to the military provocations being planned in the region directly adjacent to the southern borders of the Soviet Union.

The telegram pointed out that Britain and the British people, like other major powers, bear a major responsibility for defending peace in the Middle East. The support of the British ruling group for US policies in this region has fueled aggression. However, the military adventure against Syria planned by countries in the North Atlantic bloc such as the United States and Turkey poses a real danger of dragging Britain into a military conflict. It cannot be ignored that Britain is also a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As long as the conflict around Syria expands, Britain will be pushed into a new and devastating war, which will have serious consequences for the inhabitants of the British Isles.

Undoubtedly, a new armed conflict in the Near East would disrupt the supply of oil and other raw materials to Britain and hinder Britain's commercial ties with the Middle East and Southeast Asia. All this would cause difficulties in British industry and affect the employment of the working people. In addition, all this would further increase Britain's financial, economic, and therefore political dependence on the United States.

The telegram stated, we know that in October-November of last year, Labour Party members firmly advocated stopping the aggression against Egypt, and recently, some Labour leaders advocated using peaceful methods to resolve all disputes in the Middle East. Therefore, we hope that the British Labour Party will condemn the plan of armed intervention in Syria plotted by the aggressive groups of some countries. The CPSU Central Committee calls on the Executive Committee of the British Labour Party to take all necessary actions to prevent aggression and maintain peace in the Middle East.

The telegram stated that currently, the British Labour Party and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have some common views on many major issues of maintaining peace and international security. Therefore, the CPSU Central Committee believes that the joint efforts of our two parties will help maintain peace in the Middle East. If Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France declare that they will renounce the use of force as a means of resolving outstanding issues in the Middle East, declare non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries in this region, and all stop supplying weapons to these countries, then such a declaration would be of great significance in achieving the above-mentioned goals. We request the Executive Committee of the British Labour Party to support this proposal, and we are willing to study any constructive suggestions you may have regarding the possible prevention of the threat of war in the Middle East and the maintenance of world peace in a form that you feel is convenient, including possible meetings between representatives of our two parties. We hope that the Executive Committee of the British Labour Party will treat our telegram with goodwill and a high sense of responsibility for the fate of peace.

The telegram to the Norwegian Labour Party stated that, considering the similar views of the Norwegian Labour Party and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on issues of war and peace, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes it is necessary to draw the attention of Norwegian socialists to the situation in the Near East, which endangers the cause of peace. Those who cherish peace must unite and resolutely condemn the use of force as a means of resolving outstanding issues, and must not allow the disruption of peace in the Middle East region.

The CPSU Central Committee is also prepared to carefully study the views and possible suggestions of the Central Committee of the Norwegian Labour Party regarding guaranteeing peace and security in the Middle East.

    苏共中央致电英国和挪威工党
    要求采取行动保障中近东和平
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社15日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会分别拍内容相类似的电报给英国工党执行委员会和挪威工党中央委员会，要求采取必要措施来阻止对阿拉伯国家的侵略和保障中近东的和平。
    苏共中央致英国工党的电报说，目前在中近东，尤其是在叙利亚地区所造成的极其严重和危险的情况，引起了世界各国广大人民群众的不安。在叙利亚边界上，外国军队正在集结。在地中海东部离叙利亚海岸不远的地方，美国第六舰队的军舰正在集中。美国官方人士和军事领导人对叙利亚发表了充满挑衅性的捏造和威胁的好战声明。充满冒险情绪的、幻想恢复土耳其对阿拉伯各国人民过去统治的土耳其的某些国家领导人，也发表了类似的言论。在土耳其当局的庇护下，叙利亚反动的逃亡分子正在伊斯坦布尔汇合，他们企图扮演仰仗外国干涉者刺刀的傀儡的“叙利亚政府”的角色。有人不断企图使阿拉伯国家互相对立和发动使阿拉伯人反对阿拉伯人的自相残杀的战争。
    电报指出，近东情势危险地加剧的主要原因是大石油垄断资本，首先是美国石油垄断资本想保证自己在中近东地区的无限统治。他们不满意叙利亚现任民主政府，因为这个政府执行独立的民族政策，不希望参加侵略性的巴格达集团和艾森豪威尔主义，因为叙利亚和埃及为保卫阿拉伯人的权利、反对殖民主义者侵犯而正在进行勇敢的忘我斗争。阴谋策划者打算继叙利亚之后，对付独立的埃及，而后对战后获得独立的共和政体和君主政体的其他阿拉伯国家各个击破。
    电报随后揭露并驳斥了美国和某些西方国家的领导人为了掩饰策划中的对叙利亚的侵略而无稽地宣传的什么“共产主义危险”。
    电报说，叙利亚在其反侵略斗争中并不是孤立的。埃及政府已经声明，一旦叙利亚受到侵略，埃及将无限制地支持叙利亚。其他许多阿拉伯国家也表示支持独立的叙利亚。其他各国爱好和平的人民都和叙利亚站在一起，特别是苏联，它对在直接靠近苏联南部边界的地区策划军事挑衅不能置若罔闻。
    电报指出，英国和英国人民也像其他大国一样肩负着保卫中近东和平的重大责任。英国统治集团支持美国在这一地区的政策对发动侵略起了助长作用。但是，像美国和土耳其这样一些北大西洋集团的国家所策划的对叙利亚的军事冒险，使英国也有被拖进军事冲突中去的现实危险。不能忽略英国也是北大西洋集团的成员。只要叙利亚周围冲突扩大，英国也就会被推入新的毁灭性战争的深渊，这样就会对英伦三岛居民产生严重的后果。
    毫无疑问，在近东发生新的武装冲突会破坏对英国石油和其他原料商品的供应，会阻碍英国同中近东国家和东南亚国家的商业联系。这一切会在英国工业方面引起困难并且影响劳动人民的就业情况。此外，这一切还会进一步增加英国在财政上、经济上，从而也是政治上对美国的依赖。
    电报说，我们知道，去年10月—11月间，工党党员曾经坚决主张停止对埃及的侵略，最近，工党的某些领导人主张用和平方法来解决中近东的所有争执问题。所以我们希望，某些国家的侵略集团所策划的对叙利亚进行武装干涉的计划将会受到英国工党的谴责。苏共中央要求英国工党执行委员会采取一切必要行动来阻止侵略和保持中近东的和平。 
    电报说，目前，英国工党和苏联共产党对维护和平和国际安全的许多重大问题的看法有了某些接近，因此，苏共中央认为，我们两党的共同努力会有助于维护中近东的和平。如果英国、苏联、美国和法国声明放弃使用武力作为解决中近东悬而未决问题的方法，声明不干涉这个地区各国的内政和全都停止向这些国家供应武器，那末这种声明对达到上述目的就会有重大的意义。我们请求英国工党执行委员会支持这个建议，我们愿意以你们感到方便的形式，包括我们两党代表的可能会见，来研究你们有关可能防止在中近东发生战争的威胁和维护世界和平的任何建设性的建议。我们希望英国工党执行委员会以对和平命运高度负责的精神来善意地对待我们的这封电报。
    在给挪威工党的电报中说，考虑到挪威工党和苏联共产党在战争与和平问题上的观点相近，苏联共产党认为有必要提请挪威的社会党人注意近东危及和平事业的局势。珍视和平的人们必须联合起来，坚决斥责使用强力来作为解决悬而未决的问题的方法，不允许破坏中近东地区的和平。
    苏共中央也准备仔细地研究挪威工党中央委员会在有关保证中近东和平和安全方面的见解和可能的建议。
