　　Heroic Society Overcomes Poverty and Harsh Environment
　　——Record of the Great Achievements of the Dashing Mountains Agricultural Cooperative in Constructing the Mountainous Area
　　Working Group of the Junan County Committee of the Communist Party of China

　　In the mountain gullies of Lijiazhai Township, Junan County, Shandong Province, there is a heroic agricultural production cooperative called "Dashing Mountains," which was formed in the winter of 1955 by merging and upgrading thirteen elementary cooperatives. This cooperative has spent three years in arduous struggle against extremely harsh natural environments. Due to the successive victories in the struggle, its output has increased year by year, and the lives of its members have improved step by step. It is now truly a cooperative that cannot be shaken by wind or rain.

　　It's Difficult to Farm in Poor Mountains with Harsh Water Conditions

　　Speaking of the natural environment of the Dashing Mountains Agricultural Production Cooperative, it is truly worrying. It is located between the Three Mountains, Five Ridges, and Two Rivers of Lizhai Township, Zhulu District, Junan County. The cooperative has more than 6,500 mu of arable land, which is fragmented into small pieces by many mountains, ridges, and river gullies. Some plots are only large enough to fill a bowl, and it takes more than a dozen to make up one mu. Among the arable land, 5,400 mu are sloping and uneven terraces, and only 1,100 mu are relatively flat. The soil layer here is severely infertile: 30% of the cooperative's arable land is yellow stony soil, with only three inches of topsoil, and a layer of rock underneath; 40% is blue stony soil, with a soil layer of only two or three inches; 20% is red stony soil, with a soil layer of only three inches; only 10% is better, consisting of sticky yellow mud and river silt. Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were many trees on the mountains in this area, but they were all wantonly felled by the enemy, so soil erosion was very serious, and every year three to five hundred mu of land, along with crops and topsoil, were washed away by water. The masses reflected: "A small drought if it doesn't rain for three days, a big drought if it doesn't rain for five days; flooding everywhere if it rains for several days in a row, and no water source can be found if it is dry for several days in a row." "It's difficult to farm in poor mountains with harsh water conditions; you're afraid of both flooding and drought, and you get a poor harvest nine years out of ten!" Therefore, planting wheat here yielded only forty to fifty jin per mu, planting mixed grains yielded at most a hundred jin per mu, and corn simply couldn't grow. The average annual yield per mu in this area was only about a hundred jin. Before liberation, more than seventy households in the township were beggars all year round, one hundred and eighty households were hired laborers, and more than ninety households fled to the Northeast to escape famine; even the two hundred and twelve middle-peasant households mostly lived on a diet of bran and vegetables for half the year (being able to eat their fill of sweet potato dried and mixed grains was considered a wealthy household). No wonder the peasants at that time sighed: "A poor man has three sticks - first herding sheep, then herding cattle, then begging for a few years until the end of the road!"

　　However, the poor mountains, harsh water conditions, and fragmented land did not overwhelm the people of this old revolutionary base area of Lijiazhai Township. The steel-like heroes, tempered by long-term battles, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, carried out arduous and relentless struggles against the fierce natural enemy year after year, and constantly achieved victories. This place was liberated in 1942, began to establish the Party in 1944, and began to organize mutual aid production groups in 1948. By 1953, more than 80% of the farming households had joined the mutual aid groups. The yield of grain per mu in the mutual aid groups increased from more than one hundred jin before liberation to two hundred and thirty jin. From the winter of 1953 to the spring plowing of 1954, seven semi-socialist agricultural cooperatives were formed by one hundred and ten poor peasant households and thirty-five lower-middle peasant households of the new middle peasants. The first year of running the cooperatives achieved unprecedented increases in production. The seven cooperatives averaged 422 jin of grain per mu, an increase of about 100% compared with the mutual aid groups and farmers outside the cooperatives. By the spring of 1955, the number of cooperatives had increased to thirteen, with cooperative membership accounting for 89% of the total farming households. They again achieved a bumper harvest, averaging 549 jin of grain per mu. Therefore, when Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of cooperation were issued, these cooperatives quickly merged from thirteen places into one "Dashing Mountains" advanced cooperative (with only one farming household remaining outside the cooperative). In the first year of collectivization, although they encountered the biggest flood in twenty years and a windstorm that even the oldest people in their seventies had never experienced, and wheat also suffered from black blight, they still achieved an average yield of 552.8 jin of grain per mu. Calculated by total income, each person had an average of 613 jin of grain and more than 19 yuan in cash. About 85% of the cooperative members increased their income, and 60% of the cooperative members' living standards caught up with those of wealthy middle peasants.

　　How was such a good situation achieved? Good times are earned by collective wisdom and indomitable collective struggle. Since organizing mutual aid and cooperation, the people of Lijiazhai Township, under the leadership of the Party, have tried every possible means to overcome all difficulties, grasped the key to increasing production in the mountainous area, transformed the natural environment, and developed production.

　　Let the Rivers Change Course, Let the Land Turn Over

　　The first key to increased production that the farmers of Lijiazhai Township grasped was deep plowing, land leveling, and improving the arable land. Deep plowing generally increased the yield by fifty to seventy jin per mu compared to land that was not deep plowed. In the past, there was no habit of plowing the land locally. In 1951, labor model Li Yueju (Party member, now the cooperative director) first conducted an experiment by deep plowing four fen of barren terraced land to plant peanuts, thickening the soil layer, improving the soil, and increasing the soil's ability to retain moisture. As a result, it produced thirty jin more peanut kernels than the four fen of land that was not deep plowed. The following year, he led the mutual aid group to deep plow eight mu of peanut fields, achieving an average increase of sixty jin of peanut kernels per mu. Thus, the experience of increasing production by deep plowing was comprehensively promoted in 1953. However, because the production of mutual aid groups was still decentralized, many groups and households plowed from the beginning to the end of the year, "plowing until the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth lunar month, eating dumplings and then starting to work." Working so hard and laboring so strenuously for a year, the whole township plowed less than four hundred mu of land. After the establishment of seven agricultural cooperatives in the spring of 1954, more than 2,400 mu of land were deep plowed in one year. By the spring plowing of 1957, the entire 6,500 mu of arable land in the cooperative had been basically universally deep plowed once, and the soil layer had been deepened from two or three inches to about one chi and two cun. Some land had already begun to be deep plowed a second time. At the same time, in the practice of deep plowing and land leveling, the farmers demonstrated collective wisdom and, based on the quality of the soil, the depth of the soil layer, and seasonal differences, created methods of deep plowing and land leveling such as having mature soil on top, mixing raw and mature soil, and sandwiching one layer of mature soil between two layers of raw soil.

　　The main creation of the farmers in this township in terms of land leveling was to level small plots into large plots, based on the fragmented characteristics of the land in the mountainous area. However, in this place with thin soil and many stones, leveling the land was not an easy task. For example, the cooperative committee assigned the sixth team to level eleven fragmented small plots (totaling 5.3 mu) at the foot of the northwest mountain as the beginning of large-scale leveling of small plots into large plots. The sixth team filled in three ditches before the Spring Festival in 1954 and started digging at the cliff head on the third day of the Lunar New Year. Unexpectedly, they dug up a stone that was more than one mu in size that day. Twelve shovel heads broke ten times, but the stone still did not move. However, the determination and vigor of the cooperative members were harder than the stone. They didn't feel the pain of the frostbitten wounds on their hands being scraped by the cold wind, and they didn't stop working even when their hands broke and bled, staining the hammer handle red. Finally, after half a month of work, they dug out more than four hundred cartloads of stones, leveled the big cliff head, filled in the depressions, straightened the curved ditches, and deep plowed it again. For the first time, a plot of more than thirteen mu of land as flat as a vegetable garden appeared at the foot of the Dashing Mountains. This plot of land used to yield only a hundred jin per mu. After leveling the high and filling in the low areas, it yielded more than 600 jin of corn per mu. After setting an example, everyone learned from it, and soon more than a hundred mu were leveled. After being transformed into an advanced cooperative in the winter of 1955, it was planned to level more than 1,000 mu of land on the north side of Lijiazhai, on both sides of the Dashing Mountains River, and at the foot of Grape Mountain into flat land. In this way, not only could it be connected into a large area, expanding the arable land area, but also making cultivation easier and management more convenient. However, some cooperative members didn't understand the idea, thinking that the project was too big, and even if it was leveled well, three years of grain production might not be enough to pay for the labor. To be honest, it was indeed not easy to level this piece of land. There were eleven ridge heads, generally five meters high and ten meters wide; there were twenty-one large ponds, more than three hundred ditches; and five small rivers; totaling more than one thousand one hundred plots of land. The cooperative's leadership used the facts of increasing production by leveling land and the facts of "step-by-step" improvement in living standards since cooperation to educate the cooperative members, and the cooperative members' enthusiasm was boosted. Thus, they put forward magnificent slogans such as "劈嶺填溝" [pī lǐng tián gōu - split the ridges and fill the gullies], "让河流改道，叫土地翻身" [ràng héliú găidào, jiào tǔdì fānshēn - let the rivers change course, let the land turn over], "向大山进军" [xiàng dàshān jìnjūn - march towards the Dashing Mountains], "比建设社会主义的劲头和决心" [bǐ jiànshè shèhuìzhǔyì de jìngtóu hé juéxīn - compare the vigor and determination of building socialism], forming an overwhelming, earth-shaking, and invincible force. Not only young men and women participated in the labor, but also many white-haired elderly and teenagers wearing red scarves. Li Shouye, who was seventy years old, had not worked for more than ten years. During the land leveling, he actively took action, saying: "The cooperative director is the marshal leading the troops, and I am the commander urging the battle." He carried the red flag of excellence every day, urging the whole team to go to the fields early to work. He also competed with his grandson and won. After more than five months, people finally made the five rivers change course, chiseled through eleven ridge heads, and filled in twenty-one large ponds and more than three hundred ditches. They leveled more than one thousand fragmented small plots into one hundred and eighteen large fields, expanding the arable land area by 192 mu. The hillside became a plain, and the bottom of the gullies became fertile fields.

　　The Ferocious Mountain Floods Were Subdued

　　In order to transform nature and build their beautiful homes, the people of Dashing Mountains Cooperative used great efforts to carry out water and soil conservation work such as damming mountain gullies, building reservoirs, and leveling terraces, and created a complete method of flood prevention, water storage, and soil conservation in mountainous areas. The specific methods were: on the one hand, closing the mountains for afforestation (planting 4.2 million trees on 11,800 mu of barren mountains, planting 25,000 fruit trees, and planting trees wherever there was soil) to prevent soil erosion; on the other hand, damming mountain gullies and building slow-water dams to prevent mountain floods; and on the other hand, building reservoirs in suitable places and vigorously building terraces in an all-round way.

　　As early as the spring of 1955, when studying the key to increasing production, some middle-peasant cooperative members believed that deep plowing was the only key to increasing production, and that after the land was plowed, there would be no more ways to increase production. However, poor peasant cooperative members such as Li Yongqian actively suggested that the mountainous area lacked water, and as long as there was water, how much grain was needed, and how much grain could be grown in the fields. The Party branch and the management committee listened to the opinions of the poor peasants and decided to solve the water problem. However, everyone had no experience in digging wells. When making a plan to dig thirteen wells, some old middle peasants said: "This place has thin soil and many stones. If you can dig a well, I can chisel a pool on the Dashing Mountains." The determination of the Party branch and poor peasant cooperative members to dig wells was unwavering. The sixth team, composed entirely of thirteen poor peasant cooperative members, led by captain Li Yongqian, first contracted to dig a well for experiment. In the cold early spring, they took off their cotton clothes, bared their chests, and walked barefoot, digging through layers of stones. After six days and three nights, they finally dug out water. The fifth team, which had the most middle-peasant cooperative members, also contracted a well, but after digging for three days, they complained that the weather was cold and the water was cold, and wanted to wait until the weather warmed up before continuing. The cooperative committee transferred the sixth team to help, and the original plan was to complete this well in seven days. As a result, including digging the pit and using stone masonry, it was completed in five days. The sixth team was tempered in the process of digging wells, its well-digging technology was improved, and it also established prestige among the masses. The cooperative members called them the "Steel Sixth Team," and the Party branch and the management committee also praised this team. This year, the whole cooperative dug twenty-five wells and built a diversion ditch, connecting the wells in a chain, and diverting the water from the Dashing Mountains River all the way to the top of the ridge, which could irrigate 500 mu of land. After the establishment of the advanced cooperative in the winter of 1955, great efforts were made to build reservoirs and dam mountain gullies. When construction started, it was the cold winter month, and the northeast wind was like a knife stabbing the body. Cadres and Party and Youth League members took the lead, first carrying their luggage up the mountain, building work sheds, and arranging accommodation. Young women also entered the construction site and set up stoves. Ironworkers set up red stoves on the construction site to repair iron tools in a timely manner. They worked enthusiastically. They chiseled ridges and filled gullies with one hoe and one shovel, and struck down stones with one hammer and one drill, and then built large dams one by one. After two months of arduous labor, they chiseled through three ridges, forcing the vertical water to flow horizontally, and built eleven reservoirs, which could hold more than one million cubic meters of water. Together with the previous projects, they dammed more than 2,000 mountain gullies, built seventy-nine stone wells, and also built a slow-water sand dam. These were all unprecedented miracles. These water conservancy projects could turn 3,600 mu of dry land into irrigated fields, of which 1,500 mu could guarantee a bumper harvest even if it didn't rain. These reservoirs, dams, etc. withstood the test of last year's flood. Last year, only a few fragmented pieces of land in the whole cooperative were washed away by mountain floods, totaling only two or three mu. The situation where three to five hundred mu of land, along with crops and topsoil, were washed away by water every year was gone forever. The ferocious mountain floods were subdued by the people.

　　Leveling gully terraces began in the spring of 1955. At that time, the director of the cooperative, Li Yueju, and the cooperative members studied: After the terraces were deep plowed to thicken the soil layer, the crops took root deeply, and they were also able to resist drought and flood better than before, but heavy rains would still damage the land, and there was no source of water for irrigating sweet potato seedlings in dry weather. They referred to the practices of gully ridge fields in the plains and created a method of gully ridge terraces. That is: level the terraces, dig water pits in sections under the field embankments of each layer of terraces, spread the excavated soil into the terraces to thicken the soil layer, and wrap the embankments on the side of the mountain to prevent them from being washed away by mountain floods. In this way, when it rains, the pits can store water, and in dry weather, they can be used to irrigate the land. If the rain is heavy and the mountain flood is large, small ditches can be opened to drain water to avoid the mountain flood from washing away the field embankments. This spring, seven terraces were leveled, totaling twelve mu, ninety-three water pits were dug, and corn was planted. On average, each mu yielded 590 jin of corn, which was something that had never happened in the memory of the older generation in these lands. In 1955, another 1,500 mu of gully ridge terraces were leveled.

　　In August 1956, Dashing Mountains Cooperative sent people to Wanggou District in Fei County to visit water and soil conservation work. The cooperative committee combined the local situation with the experience of Fei County and re-improved the terrace embankments. This not only resisted drought and flood, but also avoided soil erosion. The masses called this "培埂挖沟，深翻整平，倒流水" [péi gěng wā gōu, shēn fān zhěngpíng, dào liúshuǐ - building embankments and digging ditches, deep plowing and leveling, reversing the water flow] terrace the "one combination three successes" terrace, saying: "This time we have found a grain warehouse!" From last winter to this spring before planting, 1,600 mu of such terraces have been leveled. The sloping and uneven ground is gone. The Dashing Mountains Cooperative is determined to completely level all 5,400 mu of terraces within three years according to this method.

　　While carrying out large-scale farmland capital construction, other measures to increase production were not relaxed. In recent years, Lijiazhai Township, based on the experience of other places and its own experience, has promoted the planting of high-yield crops ("Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes, corn, etc.), rational close planting, and increased fertilization, all of which have achieved good results.

　　Many People Produce Zhuge Liang

　　This spring, the Dashing Mountains Cooperative also formulated a plan to expand reproduction, and also planned to reduce financial expenditures by 29,000 yuan compared with last year (last year's total comprehensive expenditure was more than 37,000 yuan, and this year's planned expenditure is 8,500 yuan). With the reduction of expenditures alone, the whole cooperative will increase its income by an average of 40 yuan per household compared with last year. However, when the director of the cooperative, Li Yueju, returned from attending the National Socialist Construction Activists Conference, and the cooperative was brewing "trying every possible means to strive for a greater harvest this year," some cadres and cooperative members felt that after several years of efforts, the potential for increasing production had been almost exhausted, and now there was nothing they could think of except to seize some fragmented "山埯子" [shān ǎnzi - mountain mounds] to plant crops. The Party branch and the management committee carefully analyzed this situation, and recalled that they had learned many experiences in increasing production from the elderly in the past few years, believing that "the masses always have solutions." In early April, they held a symposium for old farmers to mobilize them to contribute ideas for all-round increase in production. After a period of discussion and suggestions from these elderly people, they came up with more than a dozen suggestions. For example: this year there is less chemical fertilizer, so the cooperative should establish an artificial fertilizer factory to ensure topdressing for crops; several flood ditches should be opened in the large plots of land to avoid crop death due to flooding; the newly built terrace embankments are still loose, so methods should be found to consolidate them to prevent rainwater erosion, etc. These were a great inspiration to the cooperative cadres.

　　After conducting on-the-spot observations, the cooperative cadres further studied the spirit of the county and district production increase and savings plans. They felt confident and open-minded, and felt that the cooperative's potential was not exhausted, but still had infinite potential. Therefore, through the Party branch committee, the cooperative committee, the Party and Youth League member meeting, and the cooperative member meetings organized by teams, they emphasized the benefits of carrying out the "trying every possible means to strive for a greater harvest" campaign to ensure increased production, improve cooperative member living standards, and support socialist construction. The leadership set the topic, and mobilized everyone to write articles. Everyone was very interested in trying every possible means. The more they discussed, the more enthusiastic they became, and the more methods they came up with. From expanding intercropping to utilizing all idle land, to further developing fertilizer sources, to expanding the scope of sideline business operations, to saving the use of agricultural tools and seeds, a total of five major items and 106 strategies were proposed. Expanding intercropping and utilizing idle land alone could increase income by nearly 160,000 jin of grain and more than 10,000 jin of raw rice, with each person in the cooperative increasing their income by an average of 46 jin of grain and three jin of raw rice, and the income from sideline businesses and savings was not included. The cooperative members reflected: "There are many key points in the mountainous area, with great prospects. The potential cannot be exhausted, and there is no limit to increasing production."

　　The cooperative members acted enthusiastically. The cooperative cadres also discovered and solved the following problems by working together with the cooperative members: (1) Some cooperative members believed that the tasks and production quotas had already been contracted to the small teams, and advocated that the team should concentrate its efforts on sorting out the contracted land, and that the idle land could be managed by the cooperative members individually. The cooperative educated the cooperative members to realize that the cooperative members had reserved enough small vegetable gardens and fodder fields, and that the unified management of idle land by the cooperative was both reasonable and conducive to developing production, and properly carried out the contracting of tasks and production quotas. (2) Some people disliked intercropping as troublesome and were afraid that it would not increase production. The cooperative summarized the fact that intercropping autumn soybeans with autumn sweet potatoes in the second team last year increased production by more than 30 jin per mu and educated the cooperative members, explaining that if expanding intercropping did not increase production, the increase in production would be treated as overproduction. This encouraged the enthusiasm of the cooperative members. (3) In terms of further expanding fertilizer sources, some cooperative members disliked collecting fresh manure as too dirty and troublesome and were unwilling to do it. Party members, Youth League members, and cadres took the lead in transforming toilets and cellar tanks, or setting up cans to store manure (human feces), and covering them after defecation, which was both simple and hygienic. It was promoted through organized visits and introductions. (4) In expanding intercropping, attention was also paid to helping cooperative members solve the problem of insufficient seeds of river beans, cowpeas, etc. Efforts were also made to ensure that idle land was used without affecting the principle of water and soil conservation.

　　Many cooperative members reflected: "Once you engage in trying every possible means, many people produce Zhuge Liang, and the ways to increase production become more and more numerous, and the methods become more and more reasonable day by day." "These methods are like skin ladles, which don't leak water." "Striving for a greater harvest this year and improving our lives is like having a rabbit tied to our waist. We are full of energy when we work." The whole cooperative's production has gone from a high tide to a new high tide.

　　英雄社战胜穷山恶水
　　——记大山农业社建设山区的丰功伟绩
　　中共莒南县委会工作组
    在山东省莒南县厉家寨乡的山沟里，有一个英雄的农业生产合作社，它的名字叫“大山”，是在1955年冬由十三个初级社合并升级而成的。这个社在同极端恶劣的自然环境艰苦斗争中度过了三个年度。由于斗争的节节胜利，它的产量年年提高，社员生活步步改善。它现在已经真正是一个风吹不动雨打不散的合作社了。
    穷山恶水种地难
    提起大山农业生产合作社的自然环境，可真叫人担心。它位于莒南县朱芦区厉寨乡的三山、五岭、两河之间。全社六千五百多亩可耕地，被许多山岭、河沟分割得零零碎碎，瓢一块、碗一块的，有的十几块才凑成一亩地。在耕地当中有五千四百亩是倾斜不平的梯田，只有一千一百亩地比较平展。这里土层的瘠薄是这样严重：全社30％的耕地是黄石渣子地，表土只有三寸厚，下面便是石层；40％是青石渣子地，土层只有二、三寸厚；20％是红石渣子地，土层也只有三寸厚；只有10％的粘性黄泥头和河淤地较好。这一带的山上，抗日战争前还有不少林木，但后来都被敌人滥伐了，因此水土流失十分严重，每年都有三、五百亩土地连庄稼带熟土被水冲走。群众反映：“三天不下雨是小旱，五天不下雨是大旱，连下几天雨到处泛滥，连旱几天找不到水源”“穷山恶水种地难，又怕涝又怕旱十年就得九年歉”！因此，这地种麦子每亩不过四、五十斤，种掺子顶多每亩收百来斤，种玉米根本长不起来。这一带平均每亩年产量不过百来斤。解放前，全乡有七十多户常年要饭，一百八十户当雇工，九十多户逃荒到东北；就是二百一十二户中农，也多是过着糠菜半年粮的生活（能够吃饱甘薯干、掺子的就是富裕户）。无怪当时农民会有这样的慨叹：“穷人三根棍——先放羊，后放牛，拉几年要饭棍到了头！”
    但是，穷山恶水和支离破碎的土地并没有把厉家寨乡这个老革命根据地的人民压倒，久经战斗锻炼的钢铁般的英雄们，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，同凶险的自然敌人年复一年地进行了艰苦卓绝的斗争，不断地取得了胜利。这个地方是1942年解放的，1944年开始建党，1948年开始组织生产互助组，到1953年即有80％以上的农户参加互助组。互助组每亩耕地产粮由解放前的一百余斤增加到二百三十斤。1953年冬到1954年春耕前，由一百一十户贫农和三十五户新中农的下中农组成了七个半社会主义的农业社。办社第一年就获得了空前的增产。七个社平均每亩产粮四百二十二斤，比互助组和社外农民增产一倍左右。到1955年春季，合作社就发展到十三个，入社农户占总农户的89％，又获得了平均每亩产粮五百四十九斤的丰收。因此，当毛主席关于合作化问题指示下达以后，这些社迅速的由十三处合并转为一处“大山”高级社（社外农民只有一户）。高级化的第一年，虽然遇到了二十年来没有的大水灾和七十多岁老年人都未经历过的风灾，小麦还生了黑疸病，但是仍然获得了每亩平均产粮五百五十二点八斤的丰收，按总收入计算平均每人有粮食六百一十三斤，钱十九元多。约85％的社员增加收入，60％的社员生活水平赶上了富裕中农。
    这样的好光景是怎样得到的呢？好光景是靠着集体智慧和百折不挠的集体斗争得来的。厉家寨乡的人民自从组织互助合作以后，就在党的领导下，想尽千方百计，克服一切困难，抓住山区的增产关键，改造自然环境，发展生产。
    让河流改道，叫土地翻身
    厉家寨乡的农民们最早抓住的增产关键是：深翻、整地，改良耕地。深翻的地比未深翻的地每亩一般增产五十斤——七十斤。从前当地还没有翻地习惯，1951年劳动模范厉月举（党员、现在是社长）首先在瘠薄的梯田里深翻四分地种花生作试验，加厚了土层，改良了土壤，增加了土壤保蓄水分的能力，结果，比未深翻的四分地增产花生米三十斤。第二年他又领导互助组深翻花生地八亩，获得平均每亩增产花生米六十斤的成绩。于是在1953年就全面推广了深翻地增产的经验。但是因为互助的生产仍是分散经营的，许多组、户年头翻到年尾，“翻到腊月二十九，吃了饺子再动手”，那样紧张地劳动，使劲干了一年，全乡翻地还不足四百亩。1954年春办起七个农业社以后，一年深翻地二千四百多亩。到1957年春耕前，全社六千五百亩可耕地已基本上普遍深翻了一遍，土层由二、三寸加深到一尺二寸左右。有些地已着手深翻二遍。同时在深翻、整地实践过程中，农民发挥了集体智慧，根据土质好坏，土层深浅和季节差别，创造了熟土在上，生熟土拌匀和两生夹一熟等深翻、整地方法。
    这个乡的农民在整地方面的主要创造，是根据山区土地零星的特点，整小块地为大块地。可是，在这个土薄石多的地方，整地可不是件容易的事。如社委会分配六队整平西北山下的十一块零碎小块（共五点三亩）作为大规模整小块地为大块地的开端。六队在1954年春节前填平了三道沟，大年初三就动手刨崖头，不料这天就刨着了一亩多地大的石头，十二把锹头刨断了十把，石头还是一动不动。可是社员的决心和劲头比石头还硬，他们的手上冻裂的伤口被冷风刮着也不觉痛，手破流血染红了锤把也不停工，终于用半个月的工夫刨出四百多车子石头，铲平了大崖头，填起了洼坑，取直了弯曲的沟道，又深翻了一遍，大山根下第一次出现了一块十三亩多像菜园一样平坦的耕地。这块地过去每亩只产百多斤，平高填洼整平后，每亩收玉米六百多斤。树立样子后，大家都学起来了，很快整成一百多亩。1955年冬转成高级社以后，计划把厉家寨北面、大山河两侧、葡萄山下的一千多亩地整成平地。这样，不但能连成大片，扩大耕地面积，并且耕作容易，管理方便。但有的社员思想不通，认为工程太大了，就算整好了，打三年粮食也不一定够工钱。说实在话，这片地整平确实不容易，有十一个岭头，一般都有五公尺高，十公尺宽；有二十一个大汪、三百多道水沟；还有五条小河；共有土地是一千一百多块。社的领导上就用整地增产的事实和合作化以来生活“步步登高”的事实进行教育，社员们的劲头鼓起来了，于是提出了“劈岭填沟”“让河流改道，叫土地翻身”“向大山进军”“比建设社会主义的劲头和决心”等等豪壮的口号，形成了一股排山倒海、翻天覆地、无坚不摧的力量。参加劳动的人，不仅有男女青壮年，而且有许多白发苍苍的老年和带着红领巾的少年。七十岁的厉守业已经十几年不干活了，在整地中他积极行动起来，说：“社长是领兵的元帅，我是催阵的都督。”他天天扛着优胜红旗，督促全队早下地劳动。他自己也和他孙子比赛，而且得胜了。经过五个多月的时间，人们终于使五条河改了道，凿平了十一个岭头，填好了二十一个大汪和三百多道水沟。把一千多块零碎小地整成一百一十八块大田，扩大耕地面积一百九十二亩，山坡变成了平原，沟底变成了良田。
    凶猛的山洪被驯服了
    大山社的人们为了改造自然，建设自己美好的家园，用很大的力量进行了闸山沟、修水库、整梯田等水土保持工作，并创造了一套山区防洪、蓄水、保土的完整办法。具体作法是：一方面封山造林（在一万一千八百亩荒山上造林四百二十万株，植果树二万五千棵，凡是有土的地方就有树），防止水土流失；一方面闸山沟、修缓水坝，防止山洪暴发；一方面在适宜的地方修水库，全面大力地修梯田。
    还在1955年春天，研究抓增产关键的时候，一部分中农社员认为：深翻地是唯一的增产关键，地翻完了，生产门路也就没有了。而贫农社员厉永谦等则积极建议：山地缺水，只要有了水，要多少粮食，地里能打多少粮食。党支部和管委会听取了贫农的意见，确定解决水的问题。但是大家对于打井都没有经验，在作出打井十三眼计划的时候，有些老中农就说：“这个地方地薄石头多，你能打成井，我就能在大山上凿上渊子。”党支部和贫农社员打井的决心是不动摇的。以完全由十三户贫农社员组成的第六队，在队长厉永谦的带领下首先包打一眼井作试验。他们在寒冷的初春脱去棉衣，光着膀子赤着脚，刨开层层石头，到底用了六天三夜打出水来了。中农社员最多的第五队也包了一眼，打了三天就嫌天冷水凉，要等天暖再打。社委会把六队拨去，原计划七天完成这眼井，结果连挖坑带用石砌，五天就完成了。六队在打井中锻炼出来了，打井技术提高了，一气就打成五眼井，在群众中也树立了威信，社员称他们是“钢六队”，党支部和管委会也表扬了这个队。这一年全社打井二十五眼，并修了一道引水沟，打上连环井，把大山河里的水一直引上岭顶，能浇地五百亩。1955年冬办起高级社以后，大力进行了修水库和闸山沟。开工的时候是寒冬腊月，东北风刮在身上像刀子刺一样。干部和党团员带头，首先背着行李上了山，盖起了工棚，安置好了住处，青年妇女也进了工地，安上了锅灶；铁工在工地上安上了红炉，及时修理好铁器家什。他们干的热火朝天。一镢一锨地凿岭填沟，一锤一钻地打下了石头，又一块一块地砌起了大坝。经过两个月的艰巨劳动，凿通了三道岭，迫使竖水横流，修起了十一座水库，能容水一百多万立方，连以前做的工程共闸成山沟二千多道，砌成七十九眼石井，还修了道缓水沙坝。这些都是从来未有过的奇迹。这些水利建设，可使三千六百亩旱地变成水浇田，其中有一千五百亩就是不下雨也能保证丰收。这些水库、水坝等经受了去年洪水的考验，去年全社被山洪冲毁的土地，零零碎碎的只有二、三亩，每年都有三、五百亩地连庄稼带熟土被水冲走的情况已一去不复返了。凶猛的山洪被人们驯服了。
    整沟洫梯田，是从1955年春开始兴修的。当时社主任厉月举和社员研究：梯田经过深翻加厚土层，庄稼扎根深，比以前也能够抗旱抗涝，但雨大了仍然会把地冲坏，旱天秧地瓜又没处找水源，就参考平原地区沟洫畦田的作法创造了沟洫梯田的办法。这就是：把梯田整平，在每层梯田的地堰下分段挖水坑，挖出来的土铺到梯田里加厚土层，靠山下的一边包好地堰，防止被山洪冲毁。这样，下雨时，坑里能够存水，旱天可以用来浇地，如果雨下大了，山洪较大时，就再开小沟排水，以免山洪将地堰冲坏。这年春整了七块梯田，共十二亩，挖了九十三个水坑，种上了玉米。平均每亩收五百九十斤玉米，这是这些地老辈里没有过的事情。1955年又整修沟洫梯田一千五百亩。
    1956年8月大山社派人到费县汪沟区参观水土保持工作，社委会就结合本地情况参照费县经验，将梯田地堰重新加以改良，这样不但能抗旱抗涝，也能避免水土冲刷，这种“培埂挖沟，深翻整平，倒流水”的梯田，群众叫它“一合三成功”的梯田，说：“这回找着粮食囤啦！”从去年冬到今年春种前，已整好这样的梯田一千六百亩。倾斜不平的地面没有了。大山社决心在三年内按照这个办法把五千四百亩梯田全部整完。
    在进行大规模的农田基本建设的同时，对于其他增产措施也没有放松。几年来，厉家寨乡根据外地的和本地的经验，推广了种植高产作物（“胜利百号”甘薯、玉米等），合理密植、增施肥料等措施，都得到了良好的成绩。
    人多出诸葛亮
    今年春季，大山社又订出扩大再生产的计划，还计划比去年减少财务开支二万九千元（去年全年综合开支三万七千多元，今年计划开支八千五百元），单减少开支一项，全社平均每户比去年增加收入四十元。可是，当着社主任厉月举出席全国社会主义建设积极分子会议回来，社里酝酿“想千方百计，争取今年更大丰收”的时候，有些干部、社员却觉得，经过几年的努力，增产潜力挖得差不多了，现在除了抓点零零碎碎的“山埯子”种庄稼以外，没有什么法子可想了。社支部和管委会认真分析了这种情况，想起了几年来向老年人学习了许多增产经验，认为“群众总是有办法的”，就在4月上旬，召开了一次老农座谈会，发动他们为全面增产献计。这些老年人经过七言八语的一阵喳咕，果然提出了十几条建议。如：今年化肥少，社里要建立人工造肥厂，保证庄稼上追肥；整的大片地当中要开上几道涝沟，免得庄稼涝死；新修的梯田地堰还塇，要设法巩固，免得雨水冲刷等。这些对社干部是个很大的启发。
    社干部经过实地观察，又进一步学习了县、区增产节约计划的精神，心中有底了，胸怀开朗了，觉得本社不是潜力挖光，而是还有无穷的潜力。于是，先后通过支委会、社委会、党团员会和以队为单位的社员会等，强调说明开展“千方百计，争取更大丰收”运动，对保证增产、改善社员生活和支援社会主义建设的好处。领导出题目，发动大家作文章。大家对千方百计很感兴趣，越讨论越热烈，越讨论办法越多。从扩大间作到利用一切闲散地到进一步开辟肥源到扩大副业经营范围，到节约农具、种子等的使用，共提出五大项一百零六条计策。单扩大间作和利用闲散地就可增加收入粮食近十六万斤、生米一万余斤，全社每人平均增加收入粮食四十六斤和三斤生米，而副业和节约增加收入还不在内。社员们反映：“山区关键多，出息大，潜力挖不完，增产没有顶”。
    社员热烈行动起来了。社干部又通过和社员一同劳动，发现和解决了以下几个问题：（一）有的社员认为已经包工包产到小队了，主张队里应当集中力量整理包工包产的土地，利用闲散地可由社员个人搞。就教育社员认识到社员都留足了小菜园和饲料田，闲散地由社统一经营，既合理又有利发展生产，并适当进行了包工包产。（二）有些人嫌间作麻烦，又怕不增产。就总结了去年二队秋地瓜间作秋黄豆每亩还增产三十多斤的事实进行教育，并说明扩大间作不加产，增产作为超产处理。鼓舞了社员积极性。（三）在进一步扩大肥源方面，有的社员嫌积鲜屎太脏，且麻烦，不愿搞。由党、团员、干部带头，首先改造厕所、窖缸，或设罐，积存大粪（人屎），便后加盖，既简便又卫生。通过组织参观介绍，推广开了。（四）在扩大间作中，还注意帮助社员解决江豆、豆角等种子的不足问题。并做到了要在不影响水土保持原则下进行利用闲散地。
    许多社员反映：“一搞千方百计，真是人多出诸葛亮，增产门路一步比一步多，办法也一天比一天合理”。“这些办法，像皮笊篱一样，洒水不漏”。“今年争取更大丰收，改善生活，像打了个兔子别在腰里一样，干起活来混身是劲头。”全社生产由高潮走向新的高潮。
