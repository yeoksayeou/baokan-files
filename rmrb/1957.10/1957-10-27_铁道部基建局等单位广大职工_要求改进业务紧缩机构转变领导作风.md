Broad Masses of Staff and Workers of the Ministry of Railways' Capital Construction Bureau and Other Units
Demand Improvement of Operations, Streamlining of Organization, and Transformation of Leadership Style

(By our staff reporter) The rectification movement in the Ministry of Railways' Capital Construction Bureau, Personnel Bureau, General Office, Sleeper Preservation Department, and other units has entered the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement since mid-October, and another upsurge of airing views is gradually forming. In the Capital Construction Bureau, which has only seventy staff members, from October 14th to 21st, 560 big-character posters were put up, raising 647 suggestions. On October 21st alone, 170 big-character posters were put up.

The opinions raised by the staff and workers of these units in the big-character posters are generally concentrated in the areas of administrative operations, organizational structure, and leadership style. Taking the Capital Construction Bureau as an example, opinions related to administrative operations in the big-character posters account for about 41% of the total number of opinions raised. For example, engineer Gu Peishang posted a big-character poster criticizing the leadership for being slow to resolve the issue of the scope of authority of the Capital Construction Bureau, which has left the bureau's work in a passive situation for a long time. Regarding the structural issue, engineer Hu Junying put forward nine improvement suggestions in a big-character poster; technicians Chen Shunze, Yu Bai, and Hou Bi posted a big-character poster entitled "Is it necessary to set up divisions under the bureau?", proposing the abolition of the bureau's divisions and believing that the divisions should no longer be changed to departments, because this is not conducive to giving play to the role of engineers and their work enthusiasm. Many staff and workers also put forward enthusiastic and sincere opinions on the work style of leading cadres. For example, secretary Sun Yufang, in a big-character poster entitled "The Minister's Footsteps Have Not Yet Traveled All the Bureaus Within the Ministry," hoped that the ministers could frequently go deep into the bureaus, get close to the masses, and understand the situation.

The rectification leadership groups of these units attach great importance to the opinions put forward by the staff and workers in the big-character posters, and have sorted out and studied them by category. Whatever can be changed will be resolutely changed immediately.

Before entering the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement, these units successively made summaries of the anti-rightist struggle and mobilization reports for entering the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement to the staff and workers. During the mobilization, the Capital Construction Bureau put forward "four wants" to the masses: namely, to speak freely; to use their brains and think about more problems; to present the facts and reason things out; to first put forward criticisms and opinions and not rush to consider solutions. In short, to air views deeply, thoroughly, and rectify severely, so that the leadership can improve well and quickly.

    铁道部基建局等单位广大职工
    要求改进业务紧缩机构转变领导作风
    本报讯　铁道部的基本建设局、人事局、办公厅、枕木防腐处等单位的整风运动，从本月中旬转入着重整改的阶段后，另一次鸣放高潮已渐形成。只有七十名工作人员的基本建设局，从10月14日开始，到21日止，已贴出大字报五百六十张，提出了六百四十七条意见。单是21日这一天，贴出的大字报就有一百七十张。
    这些单位的工作人员，在大字报中提出的意见，一般都集中在行政业务、机构体制、领导作风等几个方面。以基本建设局为例，大字报中的有关行政业务方面的意见，约占所提意见总数的41％。如工程师顾培尚贴出的一张大字报，就批评了领导上迟迟不解决基建局的职权范围问题，以致局的工作长期处于被动局面。关于体制问题，工程师胡俊英在大字报上提出了九条改进意见；技术员陈舜泽、于白和侯壁三个人贴出了“在局下面一定要设处吗？”的大字报，提议取消局属科，并认为不应再把科改为处。因为这样对于发挥工程师的作用和工作积极性没有好处。许多职工对于领导干部的作风也提出了热情诚恳的意见。如秘书孙玉芳在“部长的步子还没有走遍部内各局”的大字报上，希望部长们能经常深入各局，接近群众，了解情况。
    这几个单位的整风领导小组对职工在大字报上所提出来的意见非常重视，已经分门别类地进行了整理和研究。凡是能改的就坚决立即改。
    这几个单位，在转入着重整改阶段之前，都先后向职工做了反右派斗争的总结和转入着重整改阶段的动员报告。基本建设局在动员时向群众提出“四要”：即，要畅所欲言；要动脑筋多想问题；要摆事实讲道理；要先提批评和意见不要先着急于考虑解决办法。总之，要鸣的深，放的透，整的狠，这样才能使领导改的好，改的快。
