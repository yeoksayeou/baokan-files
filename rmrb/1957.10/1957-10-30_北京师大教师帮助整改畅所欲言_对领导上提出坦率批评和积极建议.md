Beijing News Agency: To allow teachers to fully speak out and help school leaders rectify, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Beijing Normal University convened a symposium on the 23rd, attended by over a dozen professors and lecturers. More than fifty criticisms and suggestions were raised at the meeting. These opinions were rich in content, with many involving significant issues in the school's work and sharp criticism of the leadership. The teachers spoke freely and frankly at the meeting. The Party Committee leader who presided over the symposium listened carefully to their opinions and repeatedly welcomed their straightforward attitude.

Professor Ye Cangcen of the Chinese Department criticized the school's Party and government leaders for lacking careful consideration and research on some major issues in their work. He cited an example: In the past, each class of students had to do two teaching internships during their studies, which was an important practical process for training higher normal students to become qualified teachers. However, last summer, some students and teachers suggested that students should study more Chinese, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and requested that the internship be reduced to one. The school did not consider or research this well and changed it to one. This year, the Ministry of Education stipulated that there should still be two internships, and the school changed it back to two, which was correct. At the beginning of the rectification movement, some people again requested that it be changed to one, and the school changed it accordingly. Ye Cangcen believes that this is a matter involving the training objectives of higher normal schools. How many internships are best can still be debated in the future, and the school can correct mistakes if they are made. The problem is that the school leadership lacks its own research and insight into such major issues, which is unacceptable.

Lecturer Yang Minru of the Chinese Department criticized the school's Party and government leaders for not grasping business leadership tightly enough in the past and for not having enough contact with the masses. She said, "I believe that the Party can lead business. However, in the past, the Party's leading comrades did not actively grasp business, which became an excuse for some rightists to attack 'the Party cannot lead business.'" Yang Minru said, "The Party also contacted the masses in the past, but rarely went deep into the grassroots. Their understanding of some people was limited to the surface and they did not understand their true thoughts. The school Party organization focused on how to implement the policy towards intellectuals in the past, but it did not do a good job because its understanding of the majority of people was still insufficient. As a result, it only united a few well-known people, and even for these few people, there was more unity than education." Teacher Lü Hesheng of the Russian Department also said: "The masses had long reflected that Hu Ming, a rightist in the Russian Department, abused his power in the department, and that Huang Yaomian, a rightist in the Chinese Department, was irresponsible in his work. When the Academic Affairs Office sent people to the department to solicit opinions in the past, some people had also raised this, but because the school leadership did not pay enough attention to everyone's opinions, it did not attract attention in time."

Teachers also criticized the phenomenon of wasted manpower in teaching. Teacher Zhao Shumei of the Geography Department said: "In the past, whenever the school mentioned streamlining institutions, it considered streamlining administrative staff. In fact, teaching staff could also be greatly streamlined." She said: "In the Geography Department, five or six teachers are responsible for one course, each teaching a section, which results in teachers being idle and the teaching effect not being good." Many teachers suggested at the meeting that the system of calculating teachers' workloads should be retained. Professor Hao Bingxin of the Mathematics Department, Professor Luo Hansu of the Education Department, and others all believed that calculating teachers' workloads is one of the standards for evaluating teachers' attendance.

Teachers also offered some opinions on how the school should lead scientific research. Some people suggested: "Last year, teachers made a lot of noise about scientific research issues. Huang Yaomian, the director of the Chinese Department and a rightist, took the salary of a first-level professor and spent five hours a day, a total of two months, writing a paper criticizing Zhu Guangqian's pragmatist aesthetic viewpoint. As a result, his own article was also full of pragmatist ideas." Teachers suggested that the school should seriously manage scientific research work and should not be biased against scientific research in the future. Teachers said that what should be paid attention to in the future is that scientific research by teachers in higher education institutions should first be combined with teaching work.

Associate Professor Zhang Fuquan of the Physics Department also raised some opinions on the Ministry of Education's slow and procrastinating work style. Many teachers also suggested that the Ministry of Education should frequently report some information about primary and secondary education to teachers in higher normal schools so that they can understand the development direction, existing problems, and leadership intentions of primary and secondary education at any time, so that teachers can implement the Party's policies and guidelines in teaching.

Teachers also raised some criticisms and suggestions on the school's administrative work, such as certain systems not being strict and labor discipline being lax.

    北京师大教师帮助整改畅所欲言
    对领导上提出坦率批评和积极建议
    本报讯　为了让教师们充分大鸣大放，帮助学校领导上进行整改，中共北京师范大学党委会于23日召集了有十几位教授和讲师参加的座谈会，会上提出了五十多条批评和建议。这些意见内容丰富，有许多涉及到学校工作中的一些重大问题和对领导上的尖锐批评。教师们在会上畅所欲言，直言不讳。主持座谈会的党委负责同志，细心地听取他们的意见，对他们率直的态度，一再表示欢迎。
    中文系教授叶苍岑在发言中批评了学校党政领导上对工作中的一些重大问题，缺乏审慎的考虑和研究。他举例说：过去每届学生在学习过程中都要作两次教学实习，这是培养高师学生成一个合格师资的重要实践过程。但是去年夏季，部分学生和教师提出学生要多学中文、数学、理化等业务知识，要求实习改为一次，学校并没有很好地考虑、研究，就改为一次。今年上半年教育部规定还是要实习两次，学校又改为两次。这是应该的。整风开始，一部分人又要求改为一次，学校又照改了。叶苍岑认为这是一个涉及高等师范学校的培养目标问题，究竟几次好，今后还可以辩论，学校改错了也可以改过来。问题在于学校领导上对这样重大的问题缺乏自己的研究和见解，是不应该的。
    中文系讲师杨敏如批评了学校党政领导人过去对学校业务领导抓得不紧、联系群众不够的缺点。她说，我是相信党能领导业务的。但是过去党的领导同志不去积极抓业务，结果反而成为一些右派分子攻击“党不能领导业务”的借口。杨敏如说：党过去也联系群众，但是很少深入基层。对于一些人的了解，只限于表面，而不了解他们真正的思想情况。学校党组织过去抓的是如何贯彻知识分子政策，但并没有抓好，因为对大多数人的了解还很不够，结果只团结了少数有名望的人，对于这些少数人也是团结多，教育少。俄文系教师吕和声也说：群众中对俄文系教员中右派分子胡明在系里滥用职权、中文系右派分子黄药眠工作不负责任早有反映，过去教务处派人到系里征求意见时也有人提过，但因学校领导上对大家的意见重视不够，所以没有及时引起注意。
    教师们对于教学方面人力浪费的现象也提出一些批评。地理系教师赵淑梅说：过去学校里一提到紧缩机构，就考虑到紧缩行政人员，实际上教学方面的人员也可以大大紧缩。她说：地理系一门课五、六位教师担任，一个人教一段，结果教师清闲，教学效果也并不好。会上许多教师建议，应该保留教师工作量的制度。数学系教授郝炳新、教育系教授骆涵素等都认为计算教师工作量是对教师工作考勤的标准之一。
    教师们对学校如何领导科学研究的问题也提出一些意见，有的人提出：去年教师中对科学研究问题嚷得很厉害。中文系系主任、右派分子黄药眠拿的一级教授的工资，用每天五小时、共两个月的时间写论文批判朱光潜的实用主义美学观点，结果他自己的那篇文章，也是实用主义思想。教师们提议，学校要把科学研究工作认真地管起来，今后不能偏激地不搞科学研究了。教师们说，今后要注意的是高等学校教师的科学研究，首先要和教学工作结合起来。
    物理系副教授张阜权还对教育部工作迟缓拖沓作风提出一些意见。许多教师还提议要教育部能经常把一些有关中、小学教育的情况，向高等师范学校的教师们作报告，让他们能随时了解中、小学教育发展方向、存在的问题和领导意图，以便教师们能在教学中贯彻党的方针、政策。
    教师们对学校行政工作中某些制度不严，劳动纪律松弛等现象也提出一些批评建议。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社专稿）
