Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 30th - The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guizhou Provincial People's Committee recently made a preliminary decision to further reduce the number of administrative staff by 10% within the province's existing administrative establishment. Relevant departments have conducted specific research into the resettlement of these staff members who will be laid off. Local leading organs are required to fully utilize existing production positions and try their best to transfer personnel who can return to production posts back to those posts. To this end, local leading organs must strengthen labor education for all staff members.

Guizhou Province began streamlining its administrative establishment in the spring of this year. By May, after adjusting, abolishing, and merging some administrative leading bodies and improving some work systems, the province had transferred more than 14,000 cadres from government offices to county and district-level leading departments and rural grassroots organizations. Among them were 77 provincial deputy ministers and directors and deputy directors of the Provincial People's Committee, as well as more than 1,000 county and section-level cadres.

    贵州决定再精简10％行政人员
    新华社贵阳30日电  中共贵州省委员会和贵州省人民委员会最近初步决定，在全省现有行政编制内再精简10％的行政工作人员。对这些将要精简的工作人员的安置问题，有关部门已经进行了具体研究。要求各地领导机关充分利用现有的生产岗位，尽量把可以回到生产岗位的人员调回生产岗位。为此，各地领导机关要对全体工作人员加强劳动教育。
    贵州省从今年春季就开始精简行政编制。到5月份，全省经过调整、撤销、合并一些行政领导机构，并改进了一些工作制度以后，已抽调出一万四千多个机关干部下放到县、区级领导部门和农村基层组织。其中有省委副部长和省人民委员会正、副厅长级干部七十七人，县、科级干部一千多人。
