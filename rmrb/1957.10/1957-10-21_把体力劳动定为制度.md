    Making Physical Labor a System
    In order to conduct socialist labor education for students, strengthen their labor viewpoint, and facilitate ideological transformation, the Peking University Student Union has made a resolution on participating in physical labor.
    The resolution requires that each student capable of labor participate in two to three weeks of full-day physical labor each semester. During the winter and summer vacations, students will be organized to participate in one to two weeks of voluntary labor in factories or rural areas. At ordinary times, small-scale public welfare labor on campus, not exceeding two hours in duration, will be organized regularly, with each class organizing at least four times per semester. The cleaning of corridors and toilets in student dormitories will be carried out by the students themselves. In addition, students are called upon to cultivate labor habits in their daily lives, such as washing their own socks, to foster good habits of cleanliness, thrift, and simplicity. Recently, professors and freshmen from the Department of Biology have gone to agricultural cooperatives to participate in labor.

    把体力劳动定为制度
    为了对学生进行社会主义劳动教育，加强劳动观点，以利于进行思想改造，北京大学学生会作出了关于参加体力劳动的决议。
    决议中要求每个能够劳动的同学在每学期中参加两个到三个星期的整天体力劳动。在寒暑假，组织同学到工厂或农村参加为时一至两周的义务劳动。在平时，经常组织一些小型的、时间不超过二小时的校内公益劳动，每学期各班至少组织四次。学生宿舍的走廊和厕所的清洁工作由同学自行打扫。此外还号召同学在日常生活中养成劳动习惯，如自洗衣袜等，来培养爱整洁、勤俭、朴素的良好作风。最近，生物系教授和一年级新生都分别到农业社参加劳动。
