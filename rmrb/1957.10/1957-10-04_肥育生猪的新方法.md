    New Method for Fattening Hogs
    Wang Deshan, a veterinarian at the Mingcheng Agricultural and Forestry Technology Extension Station in Panshi County, Jilin Province, has recently successfully experimented with a method of accelerating hog fattening by injecting milk into the thyroid gland of hogs weighing over forty catties to destroy the thyroid gland. After the first injection, the hogs gained an average of 1.44 catties per day in twenty-six days, and after the second injection, they gained an average of 1.71 catties per day in eighteen days.
    The thyroid gland is a reddish-brown nodule about the size of a fingertip in the middle of the second and third tracheal rings below the larynx. Destroying the nodule with milk allows the hog to fully absorb the nutrients in the feed it eats, which can accelerate hog fattening. Each pig only needs one injection, and piglets can be fattened into 300-400 catty hogs in one year and three months after birth. (Wu Changyou)

    肥育生猪的新方法
    吉林省磐石县明城农林技术推广站畜医王德山，最近用牛奶注射入四十斤以上的生猪甲状腺内，利用破坏甲状腺的办法，加速生猪肥育方法试验成功。第一次注射后的生猪，二十六天中平均每天长一点四四斤，第二次十八天中平均每天长一点七一斤。
    甲状腺是喉头下的第二、三个气管轮的中间的第一个手指头大小的红褐色的疙疸。用牛奶把疙疸破坏，使猪吃的饲料里的养分能够全部吸收，这样就可以加速生猪肥育。每口猪只需注射一次，小猪从生下后，一年零三个月就可喂成三四百斤的肥猪。  （吴长有）
