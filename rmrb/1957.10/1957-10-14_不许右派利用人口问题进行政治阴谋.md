Do Not Allow Rightists to Use the Population Problem for Political Conspiracies
　　Li Pu
    I am now going to expose how the rightists are using the population problem and the issue of birth control to attack the Party and socialism.
    As everyone remembers, Wenhui Daily was very enthusiastic about this issue at the time, devoting a lot of space to discussing it. Luo Longji's henchman, Liu Guanghua, interviewed Chen Da, Li Jinghan, and other so-called demographers, and wrote lengthy interview reports. Fei Xiaotong, in his famous programmatic article – "A Few Words on Sociology" – also spoke very viciously about the population problem at length. From Fei Xiaotong's confession at a symposium held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences on September 18, it can be seen that his article was one of the results of the behind-the-scenes planning by the leading figures of the Zhang-Luo alliance. It is clear that the rightists' extensive activities on the population issue were by no means accidental.
    Now it seems very clear that they intentionally used the population problem and the issue of birth control to oppose the Communist Party and socialism. They not only wanted to use this issue as one of the pretexts for restoring bourgeois sociology, but also to further use it as one of the pretexts for realizing capitalist restoration. They are worthy of being veterans of class struggle, and that is why they were able to raise this issue to such a sharp level of class struggle and political struggle.
    Treating the population problem as the fundamental problem of society has always been one of the most powerful weapons for paralyzing the revolutionary consciousness of the working class. The British bourgeoisie began doing this as early as the end of the eighteenth century through Malthus. In China, for decades, imperialism and domestic reactionaries have also done this. Rightist elements such as Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Chen Da, and Li Jinghan were cultivated in this long-term class struggle.
    How did they use this issue this time? Originally, they wanted to use the fact that China has a large population to prove that it is impossible for us to build China into a socialist country; it is like building a palace on sand, a waste of effort. Their basic argument is: because the population is too large, consumption is too great, so accumulation is extremely small, so it is impossible to achieve socialist industrialization, and it is impossible to achieve socialism.
    In his article "What Does Sociology Do?" Fei Xiaotong said: "As far as our country's situation is concerned, if the surplus is very small and cannot be accumulated to develop heavy industry, then it is difficult to imagine that this society can enter socialism. What we want to develop now is not other societies, but a socialist society. ... Then we should do the math, how much means of production does a person need, how much money do these means of production cost, and how to accumulate this capital." The real meaning of this passage is to point out the direction of attack, to ask fellow "experts" to use calculation methods to prove that socialism cannot be achieved.
    So, Wu Jingchao came to do the math. He published an article in the March issue of New Construction entitled "A New Discussion on China's Population Problem." This article was fully adorned with Marxist-Leninist phrases, and therefore once confused some people. He mainly grasped two points: one is the extreme necessity of raising labor productivity for the socialist system, and the other is that the basic economic law of socialism requires production to be carried out on a highly technical basis. He deliberately distorted these Marxist-Leninist phrases and made extremely one-sided calculations, proving that doing it this way is wrong and doing it that way is also impossible. Then, he said insidiously: "How to eliminate the technical backwardness in the national economy in the shortest possible time, so that all laborers can produce on a highly technical basis and create very high labor productivity, it seems that there is no satisfactory solution so far." The meaning is obvious: the future is bleak, there is no way; no matter how hard you work, it is just fooling around.
    There is also an economist who does calculations, and he calculates on a broader scale. He not only considers the state of capital accumulation and the requirements for expanding accumulation, but also calculates a large number of accounts from expanding the sources of foreign exchange and industrial raw materials, as well as promoting scientific research, etc. The conclusion is: because the population is too large and capital accumulation is too small, which is insufficient for distribution, it is not possible to develop many large-scale industries, but only to develop more medium and small-scale industries. Then he brought out a sentence from Lenin to clarify the meaning of his words. He said that Lenin said, "Without large-scale industry, there is no socialism." This means that because China has too many people, it cannot achieve socialism.
    Here, let's talk about the most important point of these arguments. See how they deliberately obliterate the facts and create confusion.
    Can we build heavy industry and large-scale industry? Do we already have some heavy industry and large-scale industry? Our steel has increased to more than four million tons, we can manufacture jet aircraft, and we can manufacture automobiles. Are these heavy industries and large-scale industries? Only eight years after the founding of the country, these achievements cannot be considered few or slow, right?
    Wu Jingchao's basic argument can be summarized as follows: First, the population is too large, consuming a large amount of capital that can be accumulated, so it is impossible to equip highly advanced technology, which is required by the basic economic law of socialism. Second, using this limited capital and following this law, the number of newly employed people that can be added each year is very small, and there will be an increasingly large number of unemployed people. Third, if we must increase the employed population, we can only reduce labor productivity; but that is a regression of society, and there is no talk of socialism. Fourth, then, is it okay to let some people take the first step, equip themselves with highly advanced technology, and let other people temporarily equip themselves with relatively backward technology? No. Because this does not meet the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism. He really said that, please see: "Of course, if the means of production we allocate to each laborer is a little less or lower than the ideal level, production can still proceed as usual, but this kind of production is not carried out on a highly technical basis, but may be carried out on a backward technical basis, which is not in line with the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism."
    Why is it "not in line"? Wu Jingchao himself cannot give a reason. In fact, the basic economic law of socialism does not require that "every laborer" be engaged in production on a highly technical basis all at once; that is impossible and completely illogical. Wu Jingchao is just deliberately distorting it. Therefore, he had to "give an example" to muddle through. He wrote: "For example, in the textile industry, what we require is to carry out production on the basis of automatic textile machines, not on the basis of hand spinning machines or hand looms." In this way, he came to his predetermined conclusion: "There is no satisfactory solution!"
    Please see, the whole trick is built on this "highly advanced technology," built on this "ideal level." He relies on these "automation," "electrification," and the so-called "most reasonable, most economical, and most effective utilization" of labor and other words to deceive people's eyes and to support the argument of his long article. But we want to ask: Why does the textile industry have to "demand" automation immediately? Why must it be manual operation if it is not automation? Between automation and manual operation, there are semi-automation, mechanization, and semi-mechanization stages. A professor who teaches "planned economy" in a university is impossible not to have this little bit of common sense, so why deliberately hide it and not say it?
    Now let's talk about his so-called "solution." Is there a "solution that everyone is satisfied with"? We have it, but of course it cannot satisfy these bourgeois rightists. In terms of technology policy, on the one hand, we must build a number of first-class large enterprises equipped with the latest technology. This is the backbone and pillar of our industrialization. On the other hand, we must never blindly pursue that everything must be highly technical, everything must be automated, and everything must be large-scale; we must never blindly pursue that "every laborer" is equipped with highly advanced technology all at once. Contrary to what Wu Jingchao and his ilk said, developing some small and medium-sized enterprises and using some backward technologies under certain conditions is beneficial to us. We can manufacture the equipment for small and medium-sized enterprises ourselves, which can save foreign exchange. Small and medium-sized enterprises require less investment, are quick to build, and are easy to achieve results. They can help accumulate capital relatively quickly and can accommodate more labor. We require a rapid increase in production, but we do not have much capital, and we have abundant labor resources; so we should adopt this policy. Chairman Mao said in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "China has a large population, which is a good thing, but of course there are also difficulties." What is good for? For socialism. What is difficult for? Also for socialism. Therefore, in socialist construction, we must give full play to the favorable condition of abundant human resources, fully take care of the difficulties caused by the large population, and at the same time actively advocate appropriate birth control. In short, it is a two-point theory, not a one-point theory.
    In fact, the rightist gentlemen are fully aware of these situations. They just want to say this deliberately in order to create ideological confusion among the masses and make the people lose confidence in socialism and industrialization.
    Maybe the rightist gentlemen will still quibble and say that we have wronged them. They will say: They have at most made theoretical mistakes, but their intentions are good; they are doing this only to promote birth control.
    Yes, rightist gentlemen, when you use the population problem to oppose the Communist Party and socialism, you are indeed focusing on birth control; pretending that you only have the intention of promoting birth control, and no intention of opposing the Communist Party and socialism; on the contrary, you support the Communist Party and are for socialism. But first, you have tried every means to prove that the population is already too large and that socialism cannot be built. Second, you are very clear that birth control will not work immediately. Even if it works immediately in the whole of China from this moment on, and it is 100% strict and 100% ideal, it will only be effective in more than ten years. Sima Zhao's intentions are obvious to everyone. Your tricks cannot be hidden from people.
    In fact, you are saying this: "Too large a population is China's fatal wound," "The population problem is China's main contradiction," and China should first solve the population problem! What socialist revolution, what socialist transformation, what socialist construction, what development of heavy industry, what agricultural long-term planning, what improvement of people's lives are all retrogressions, all nonsense, all futile, and all dreams!
    It is clear that the rightists want to take the capitalist road. Now the question is, how exactly to take it? The people of the Zhang-Luo alliance dare not say it publicly. But the aforementioned economist's article inadvertently revealed some news. He said: It is difficult to solve the contradiction between China's lack of capital and its large population. He pointed out two paths. He said: "We disdain to borrow from the United States, and we cannot use the imperialist method of exploiting colonies to extract capital; nor can we imitate Japan and use the Sino-Japanese War indemnity as capital for industrialization. We have to rely on our own efforts and rely on our own accumulation." These are indeed two completely opposite paths, and there is no problem with that. But then he said: "But the ratio of our own accumulation to consumption is 79% to 21%. Can we reduce consumption a little? Looking at the actual situation in our country, this is dangerous."
    We see, since this is the case, then we can only take the former path. In other words, it is forced to go to Liangshan, it is a last resort; and it is patriotic, it is for the interests of the people, it is to solve the basic problem of population, and it is to realize the great ideal of industrialization! In other words: selling China to American imperialism has a theoretical basis! Of course, things have not developed to this point. But this is the logic of things themselves. The leading figures of the bourgeois rightists know this very well. They plan to do this. They have long had such and such connections with American imperialism and have long made such and such preparations. Therefore, they will definitely applaud and appreciate this kind of argument.
    It can be seen that the strategic significance of the rightists' use of the population problem lies in: on the one hand, opening up the road to subverting socialism in theory and ideology; on the other hand, opening up the road to capitalist restoration in theory and ideology.
    Isn't this dangerous enough, despicable enough, and vicious enough? But the rightists feel that this is not enough. The rightists have more direct and more realistic purposes in using this issue. That is to use the population problem to incite, provoke, and expand contradictions. Fei Xiaotong fired the first shot in his programmatic article. He said:
  "Recently, many people have paid attention to the population problem. No matter how you say it, this problem always exists. In the past, because Malthus' theory of population was criticized, everyone did not dare to mention this problem again. It seems that whoever mentions this problem should be criticized." He also said: "Everyone does not dare to talk about it, but this does not eliminate the problem; as a result, as soon as the mouth is opened, unscientific propaganda such as 'eating tadpoles' appears. I don't blame the people who promote eating tadpoles, let alone the people who eat tadpoles, but blame the cap that hinders the study of the population problem." Isn't this creating rumors, slandering, and provoking dissension? It is really like seeing the person and hearing the voice. You see how he seized this issue as if he had found a treasure, how full of hatred he is for the Communist Party, how viciously he attacks, and how insidiously he sets fires!
    There is something even more blatant than this. Another rightist element, "Doctor of Philosophy" Lu Qinfan, a researcher at the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, who claims to have been "strongly concerned about the population problem for more than 20 years," is a very active participant in this kind of activity. He praised Wu Jingchao's article very much, and then he also wrote several articles. He hopes that literary and art workers will write about how the masses of women in labor are dissatisfied, smashing hospitals, smashing milk farms, and smashing trade unions to demand welfare, etc. This is the first stage. Then parents smash schools for their children to enter, urban youths smash factories and mines for jobs, and rural youths leave the cooperatives because they cannot expand the area of cultivated land, and even livestock demand breeding bases to raise calves and foals, etc. Ring the alarm and let the multi-child parents who are waiting to be elected quickly dismount. We want to ask, first of all, is the population problem that serious, when, where? Secondly, you said it is to promote birth control, then there are many ways, why smash this and smash that? Isn't this inciting the people to oppose the Communist Party and socialism?
    For this kind of incriminating evidence, we only need to point out one thing: they pay close attention to provoking the peasants and provoking the relationship between workers and peasants. This can be seen from the articles of Wu Jingchao and the aforementioned economist.
    According to what has been said above, it can be seen that during a period when the bourgeois rightists were attacking the Communist Party and socialism, what they were talking about was not the population problem, not the birth control problem, and not the academic problem; but the real class struggle problem and the serious political struggle problem. Therefore, we must fight, we must thoroughly defeat them, expose their conspiracies, and crush their tricks!

　　不许右派利用人口问题进行政治阴谋
　　李普
    我现在要揭露右派怎样利用人口问题、节育问题来向党向社会主义进攻。
    大家记得，那时候文汇报对这个问题很起劲，花了很多篇幅来讨论。罗隆基的爪牙刘光华访问了陈达、李景汉等等所谓人口学家，写了长篇的访问记。费孝通在他那篇有名的纲领性的文章——“关于社会学，说几句话”中，也极其恶毒地讲了一大段人口问题。从9月18日费孝通在中国科学院召开的座谈会上的交代可以看出：他那篇文章，是章罗联盟的首脑人物策划于密室的结果之一。可见，右派分子就人口问题大肆活动，绝不是偶然的。
    现在看来很清楚，他们是有意利用人口问题、节制生育问题来反共、反社会主义的，他们不仅要假借这个问题，作为恢复资产阶级社会学的由头之一，还要进一步把它作为实现资本主义复辟的由头之一。他们不愧是阶级斗争的老手，所以才能够把这个问题，提到这样尖锐的阶级斗争高度和政治斗争高度。
    把人口问题说成社会的根本问题，从来就是麻痹工人阶级革命意识的最有力的武器之一。英国资产阶级早在十八世纪末，就通过马尔萨斯开始这样做了。在中国，几十年来，帝国主义和国内的反动派，也早就这样做了。费孝通、吴景超、陈达、李景汉等这些右派分子，就正是在这种长期的阶级斗争当中培养出来的。
    这回他们是怎样利用这个问题的呢？原来，他们是要利用中国人口众多这一点来证明：我们想把中国建设成为一个社会主义的国家，是办不到的；好像在沙滩上建设宫殿，白费力气。他们的基本论点是：因为人口过多，所以消费很大，所以积累极少，所以不可能实现社会主义工业化，不可能实现社会主义。
    费孝通在“社会学搞些什么”一文里说：“就拿我国的情况而论，如果说剩余的为数很少，不能积累起来发展重工业，那就很难想像这个社会能进入社会主义了。我们现在要发展的不是其他社会，而是社会主义社会。……那就应当算算账，一个人要多少生产资料，这些生产资料要多少钱，怎样去积累这笔资金。”这段话的真实意思，就是指出进攻的方向，要同伙的“专家”们用算账的办法，来证明社会主义是搞不成的。
    于是，吴景超就来算账。他在新建设3月号上发表了“中国人口问题新论”一文。这篇文章满身披挂着马列主义词句，因此曾经迷惑了一些人。他主要抓住两条：一条是提高劳动生产率对社会主义制度的极端必要性，一条是社会主义基本经济规律要求在高度技术基础上进行生产。他把这些马列主义词句肆意加以曲解，又大算其片面的账，证明这样搞不对，那样办也不行，然后阴险地说道：“如何在最短期内，消灭国民经济中的技术落后现象，使所有劳动者都在高度技术的基础上生产，都能够创造出很高的劳动生产率，则到目前为止，似乎还没有一个大家满意的方案。”这意思很明显：就是前途暗淡，没有办法；尽管你们干得再起劲，也不过是胡闹。
    算账的还有一位经济学家，他算的面更宽。他不仅从资金积累的状况，扩大积累的要求，并且从扩大外汇和工业原料的来源，以及推进科学的研究等等方面，算了一大堆的账。结论是：因为人口过多，资金积累太少，不敷分配，所以不能搞很多的大型工业，而只能多搞中小型工业。然后他抬出列宁的一句话来画龙点睛地点清了他这些话的意义。他说，列宁说过，“没有大工业，就没有社会主义”。这就是说，中国因为人口太多，所以搞不成社会主义。
    这里，我们来谈谈这些论点的最主要之点。看他们怎样地故意抹杀事实，制造混乱。
    我们能不能建设重工业、大工业呢？我们是不是已经有了一些重工业、大工业呢？我们的钢增加到了四百多万吨，能够制造喷气式飞机了，能够制造汽车了，这是不是重工业、大工业呢？建国刚刚八年，这些成就，总不能算少、不能算慢了吧！
    吴景超的基本论点，归纳起来是这样：第一，人口太多，大量地消费了可以积累的资金，因此无法装备高度技术，而这是社会主义基本经济规律所要求的。第二，拿这点有限的资金，按照这个规律办事，每年所能新增加的就业人口就很少，就会有越来越大量的人失业。第三，如果一定要增加就业人口，就只有降低劳动生产率；但那就是社会的后退，谈不上什么社会主义了。第四，那么，让一部分人先走一步，装备高度技术，让另一部分人暂时装备比较落后的技术行不行？不行。因为这不合社会主义基本经济规律的要求。他确实是这样说的，请看：“当然，我们对于每一劳动者所配备的生产资料，如果比理想的水平少一些，低一些，生产还是可以照旧进行的，但是这种生产，就不是在高度技术基础上进行，而可能是在落后技术基础上进行，那是不符合于社会主义基本经济规律要求的。”
    为什么“不符合”呢？吴景超自己也说不出个道理来。其实社会主义基本经济规律并没有要求一下子使“每一劳动者”都在高度技术基础上进行生产；那是办不到的，而且是完全不合逻辑的。吴景超不过是故意曲解罢了。因此，他只好“举个例子”，蒙混过关。他这样写道：“举个例子来说，在纺织工业中，我们所要求的，是在自动纺织机的基础上进行生产，而不是在手纺机或手织机的基础上进行生产。”如此这般，他就得出了他那个预先制定好了的结论：“没有一个大家满意的方案！”
    请看，全部把戏就建立在这种“高度技术”上面，建立在这种“理想的水平”上面。他就是靠这些“自动化”，“电气化”，以及所谓对劳动力的“最合理、最经济、最有效的利用”等等这些词句，来蒙蔽人们的眼睛，来支持他那篇大文章的论点。不过我们要请教一下：为什么纺织工业也非得马上“要求”自动化不可呢？为什么如果不是自动化，就非得是手工操作不可呢？自动化同手工操作之间，还有半自动化，机械化，半机械化这些阶段，堂堂一位在大学里讲授“计划经济”的教授，绝不可能没有这点子常识，那么为什么故意隐瞒不说呢？
    现在我们再谈谈他那个所谓“方案”的问题。有没有“大家满意的方案”呢？我们有的，不过当然不能使他们这些资产阶级右派分子满意。这在技术政策方面，就是一方面必须建设一批头等的大企业，装备最新式的技术，这是我们工业化的骨干和支柱。另一方面，我们又决不盲目地追求一切都要高度技术，一切都要自动化，大规模；绝不盲目地追求使“每一劳动者”，一下子都装备高度技术。同吴景超之流所说的恰恰相反，发展一些中小企业，在一定条件下利用某些落后技术，对我们是有利的。中小企业的设备，我们自己能够制造，可以节省外汇；中小企业投资少，建厂快，见效易；有助于比较快地积累资金，又能容纳较多的劳动力。我们要求很快地增加生产，但是资金不多，而劳动力资源却很丰富；所以我们正好采取这种方针。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这篇讲演中说：“我国人多，是好事，当然也有困难”。对什么是好事呢？对社会主义。对什么有困难呢？也是对社会主义。所以，在社会主义建设中，必须充分发挥人力资源丰富这个有利条件，充分照顾人口众多所引起的困难，同时积极提倡适当节制生育。总之，是两点论，不是一点论。
    其实，右派先生们完全知道这些情况。他们只是故意要这样说，以便在群众中制造思想混乱，使人民群众对社会主义丧失信心，对工业化丧失信心。
    也许右派先生们还要狡赖，说我们冤枉了他们。他们会说：他们至多只是犯了理论上的错误，而他们的用心是好的；他们这样做，只是为了提倡节制生育。
    是的，右派先生们，当你们利用人口问题来反共反社会主义时，的确是把题目做在节制生育上面；装出只有提倡节制生育之心，毫无反共反社会主义之意；相反地倒是拥护共产党的，倒是为了社会主义的。可是第一，你们已经千方百计地证明，现在人口已经太多，已经建不成社会主义了。第二，你们自己很清楚，节育绝不是马上行得通的。即使从此时此刻起，在全中国马上行通了，而且百分之百地严格，百分之百地合乎理想，也只有在十几年之后才能见效。司马昭之心，路人皆知。你们的鬼把戏，是瞒不了人的。
    其实，你们正是这样说的：“人口太多是中国的致命伤”，“人口问题是中国的主要矛盾”，中国应当首先解决人口问题！什么社会主义革命，什么社会主义改造，什么社会主义建设，什么发展重工业，什么农业远景规划，什么改善人民生活，都是倒行逆施，都是胡作非为，都是徒劳，都是梦想！
    右派要走资本主义道路，这点很明显。现在问题在于，究竟怎样走法？这点，章罗联盟的人不敢公开说出来。可是前述那一位经济学家的文章，倒无意中透露了一点消息。他说：要解决中国资金少，人口多的矛盾，不亦难矣哉。他指出了两条道路。他说：“我们不屑向美国借款，我们亦不能用帝国主义剥削殖民地的方法来榨取资金；亦不能仿效日本，以甲午赔款作为工业化的本钱。我们只得自力更生、依靠自身的积累。”这确实是两条截然相反的道路，这点完全没有问题。不过他接着就说道：“但自身的积累与消费的比例，是79％与21％之比，可否把消费减少一些呢？一看我国的实际情况，这是带有危险性的。”
    我们看，既然是这样，那就只能走前一条路了。换句话说，资产阶级右派分子走这条路，是逼上梁山，是不得已；而且是爱国，是为了人民的利益，是为了解决人口这个基本问题，是为了实现工业化这个伟大理想！换句话说：把中国出卖给美帝国主义，有了理论根据了！当然，事情没有发展到这一步。但这是事物本身的逻辑，资产阶级右派的首脑人物心里是雪亮的，他们正是这样打算的，他们同美帝国主义早已有着这样那样的联系，早已做了这样那样的准备。所以，他们一定会热烈鼓掌，赞赏这种论调。
    可见，右派利用人口问题的战略意义就在于：一方面，在理论上和思想上开辟颠覆社会主义的道路；一方面，在理论上和思想上开辟资本主义复辟的道路。
    这不是已经够危险，够卑鄙，够毒辣了吗？但是右派觉得这样还不够。右派利用这个问题，还有更直接和更现实的目的。那就是利用人口问题来进行煽动，来挑拨和扩大矛盾。费孝通在他那篇纲领性的文章中放了第一枪。他说：
  “最近很多人注意了人口问题。这个问题，不论怎样说法，总是存在的。过去却因为批判了马尔萨斯人口论，大家都不敢再提这个问题了。好像谁一提这个问题就该批判似的。”又说：“大家不敢谈，并没有取消这问题；以致一松口，就出现了‘吃蝌蚪’的不科学的宣传。我并不怪宣传吃蝌蚪的人，更不怪吃蝌蚪的人，而要怪阻碍研究人口问题的帽子。”这不是造谣中伤、挑拨离间是什么呢？真是如见其人，如闻其声。你看他怎样如获至宝地抓住了这个问题，对共产党充满了怎样刻骨的仇恨，怎样恶毒地进攻，怎样阴险地放火！
    还有比这个更露骨的。另一个右派分子“哲学博士”陆钦范，农业科学院的研究员，自称“对人口问题强烈关心已有二十多年”，是进行这种活动的很积极的一个。他非常称颂吴景超那篇大作，然后自己也写了好几篇文章。他希望文艺工作者，写一些产妇群众们如何不满，砸医院，砸牛奶场，砸工会要求福利等等，这是第一阶段。接着是父母们为了孩子入学，砸学校；城市青年要求就业，砸厂矿，农村青年们为了扩大不了耕地面积，纷纷离开合作社；以至牲口们为了养犊育驹，要求饲养基地等等。敲起警钟，让候补的多子女父母们，赶快下马。我们要问一问，首先，人口问题那里有那样严重，什么时间，什么地点？其次，你说是为了提倡节育，那么办法很多，为什么要砸这个，砸那个？这不是煽动人民来反共反社会主义，又是什么呢？
    这一类罪证，我们只要指出一点：他们很注意挑拨农民，挑拨工农关系。这点，从吴景超和前述那位经济学家的文章都可以看出来。
    根据上面所说，可见，资产阶级右派在向共产党向社会主义进攻的一个时期中，他们谈的并不是什么人口问题，并不是什么节育问题，并不是什么学术问题；而是现实的阶级斗争问题，严重的政治斗争问题。因此，我们必须战斗，必须彻底打垮他们，揭露他们的阴谋，粉碎他们的诡计！
