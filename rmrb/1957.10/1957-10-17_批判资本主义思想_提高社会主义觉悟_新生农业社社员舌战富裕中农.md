Criticize Capitalist Ideology, Enhance Socialist Awareness
	New Agricultural Cooperative Members Engage in Heated Debate with Prosperous Middle Peasants

According to the Shanxi Daily, in the course of the great blooming, great contending, and great debate in the Xinsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Zong'ai Township, Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, poor and middle peasants spoke their minds freely and engaged in in-depth and meticulous debates with some prosperous middle peasants whose capitalist thinking was relatively serious. This vivid debate further educated the poor and lower-middle peasants and also enabled the prosperous middle peasants to recognize the major issues of right and wrong, thereby raising their socialist consciousness.

Dou Zhanyuan Was Not Really Short of Grain - He Just Wanted to Speculate and Make a Fortune

Dou Zhanyuan had engaged in grain speculation in the past. After joining the cooperative, he did not work hard and often complained about being short of grain. At one debate, people asked him why he was "complaining about grain shortage?" He even said, "If I don't have grain, I can't just wait to starve to death!" Dou Zhanyuan's neighbor, Yang Jijing, said, "Dou Zhanyuan, you need to watch what you say. I personally saw you bring back 160 jin of grain one day, and the next day you milled four *shi* of grain and ground flour all day. Where did all that grain come from?"

Dou Zhanyuan opened his mouth but didn't say anything. Zhao Meihu continued, "If you really didn't have grain, it would be right to ask the state for supplies. We can't let you 'wait to starve to death.' But after the grain was supplied to you, you went to sell *youmian he lao* (buckwheat noodles)..."

Before Zhao Meihu could finish, Dou Zhanyuan, as if he had found a handle, interrupted, "Ten *jin* of *youmian* is barely enough for five people to eat for a day. Selling *he lao* can be exchanged for seventy *jin* of corn. To make a living, isn't that right!"

Everyone did the math. One *jin* of *youmian* costs 1.5 *jiao*, and making it into *he lao* can sell for 6.5 *jiao*, more than three times the profit. Many people questioned, "You asked the state for grain and made it into *he lao* to exploit people at high prices, making a fortune for yourself, and you still have the nerve to say it's not enough to eat. How much grain would be enough for you to engage in speculation and profiteering like that?"

At this point, Dou Zhanyuan finally admitted his mistake, confessed to his capitalist thinking of wanting to make a fortune through speculation, and expressed that he would follow the unified purchase and sale policy with everyone in the future.

Wang Cunkou Wants to Gain Without Labor - No Wonder He Says the Present is Not as Good as the Past

In discussing whether cooperation is superior or not, some prosperous middle peasants believed that cooperatives were not as good as individual farming. Wang Cunkou was a representative of this type of person. He said, "It's clearly not as good as before, but you always have to say it's better than the past. You say it's good, but I think it's not good. If it weren't for the cooperatives and the unified purchase and sale system, my life would have been several times better than it is now."

Many people stood up at once to debate with Wang Cunkou. The person chairing the meeting said, "Everyone, sit down. Let one person speak at a time." Zhao Laiyun pointed at Wang Cunkou and said, "You say the present is not as good as the past, but you've forgotten about the 'ten mores' of our village in the past. Let me tell you about them again: First, there were more people with little or no land. A few landlords and rich peasants occupied more than 3,400 *mu* of land, while 662 peasant households occupied less than half of that. Now everyone is the master of the land. Second, there were more people working as hired laborers. There were more than 150 hired laborers in the whole village, but now there are none. Third, there were more people without houses to live in. More than 100 households lived in temples and broken kilns, and some were even on the streets. Now everyone has a house to live in. Fourth, there were more people begging for food and starving. More than 100 people were begging for food, and more than 150 were starving. Now everyone can eat their fill. Fifth, there were more people smoking opium and white powder. There were more than 700 such people in the whole village, but now there are none. Sixth, there were more people selling their sons, daughters, and wives. I know of twenty-four cases, but now there are none. Seventh, there were more people wearing burlap sacks and straw mats. There used to be more than 100, but now everyone has new and old clothes. Eighth, there was more theft. The poor people were forced to do it. More than 100 people had done this disgraceful thing, but now they are all good people. Ninth, there was more gambling. There were more than 600 gamblers in our village, but now there are none. Tenth, there were more restrictions. In those days, you couldn't even walk around freely. Now the people are truly free. How can you say that the present is not as good as the past?"

Wang Cunkou was still not convinced. He insisted, "Others are good, but I am not good. I used to farm 24 *mu* of land, and in an average year I would harvest 25 *shi* of grain. For a family of four, we had enough to eat, wear, and spend. Now, after working hard for a year, I can't even bring back 20 *yuan* besides food. How can you say..."

"So that's what you're talking about," Wang Qingming interrupted Wang Cunkou. "I know your situation. How did you do so well in the past? Every year you used livestock to exchange for more than 100 man-days of labor, and you could get more than two *shi* of rent for renting out one *mu* of land. You didn't earn that yourself!" After pausing, he added, "Let's just talk about your income. In those days, even with your boss and exploitation, you only had an income of about 130 *yuan* a year, and you had to pay one-third of it for taxes. Now, both you and your wife work more than 250 labor days a year, and you earn a net income of more than 250 *yuan*. Isn't that better than you used to be?"

Niu Xuegui also said, "My wife and I work, and we can do more than 450 labor days a year. You and your wife also work, but you can't even do 300 labor days a year. If you don't want to go back to the past, work hard, and your income will be even higher."

Many people said, "That's right, you can't just want to live a good life without working." "Cunkou's life is not worse than before, it's just that he doesn't want to work."

At this time, the production team leader spoke up, "You think about your own path, and we think about our own path. If we follow your path, a few people will get rich, and most people will become poor again. You can't even guarantee that you won't become poor yourself. Cooperatives have only been around for two years, and most people's lives are much better than before. They will be even better in a few years." With everyone's help, Wang Cunkou finally admitted his mistake. He said, "I took the wrong path. You'll see in the future, I'll always work with everyone to run our cooperative well." The next day, he asked the team leader to assign him work.

Shi Fuchang Forgets His Roots - He Actually Forgets That the Past is Not as Good as the Present

In debating whether the socialist economic system is good or not, the newly prosperous middle peasant Shi Fuchang said, "You say this is good and that is good, but why can't we eat grain freely, and why can't we buy cloth freely? There's never enough *shaobing*, *maye*, and candy."

Zhao Laiyun pointed at Shi Fuchang and said, "Brother, how did you come to Zong'ai from Xiaodongke (village name)?"

"Carried in with a carrying pole!" Shi Fuchang replied unintentionally.

"That's right!" Zhao Laiyun continued, "In those days, you carried a family in with a carrying pole, without a house or land, and you worked as a hired laborer for 18 years. In those days, you could eat grain freely, but how much could you afford to eat in a year? Even if you couldn't afford 360 days, you couldn't afford 260 days. In those days, you could buy cloth freely, but how much did you buy? Even if you could wear one *zhang* of cloth every two years, that would be considered good. In those days, there were a lot of *shaobing*, *maye*, and candy on the street, but how many did you eat? You just looked at them, satisfying your eyes but not your stomach. After liberation, you were given a house and land. Now that you've joined the advanced cooperative, you're living a better life, and you want to buy more things. Everyone is the same. The lives of the peasants are better, and the lives of the workers are better. Just take your three sons and daughters-in-law as an example, they are all workers, aren't they the same? In the past, most poor people couldn't afford to buy things, so there were more things. Now everyone's life is better, and everyone wants to buy things, so naturally there are fewer things, so we have to share them. It's better for everyone to share things now than it was in the past when we couldn't afford to buy anything."

"Brother Runba (Runba is Zhao Laiyun's nickname)!" Shi Fuchang stood up and shouted, "My view is wrong. Once a bowl of water is spilled on the ground, it can't be collected. You'll see in the future."

### 批判资本主义思想  提高社会主义觉悟  新生农业社社员舌战富裕中农

　　批判资本主义思想  提高社会主义觉悟
    新生农业社社员舌战富裕中农
    据山西日报消息　山西省寿阳县宗艾乡新生农业社在大鸣大放大争过程中，贫、中农一起畅所欲言，和一部分资本主义思想比较严重的富裕中农，展开深入细致的说理辩论斗争。这场生动的辩理斗争，进一步教育了贫农和下中农，也使富裕中农认清了大是大非，提高了社会主义觉悟。
    窦占元并非缺粮  而是想投机发财
    窦占元在过去即进行粮食投机活动，入社后不好好劳动，经常闹缺粮。有一次辩论会上，人们问他为什么“闹粮”？他还说：“没有粮食，不能等着饿死呀！”窦占元的邻居杨吉金说：“窦占元，说话要把舌头伸展。我亲眼见你头天弄回一百六十斤粮食，第二天就碾了四石谷，磨了一天面，那么多的粮食是从哪里来的？”
    窦占元张了张嘴没有啃声，赵昧虎接着说：“你真没有粮食，要求国家供应，这应该，不能叫你‘等着饿死’，可是供应你了粮食，你却去卖莜面河涝……。”
    没等赵昧虎说完，窦占元好像抓住什么把柄似地抢着说：“十斤莜面，顶多够五口人吃一天，卖了河涝能换七十斤玉茭，过光景吆，这不能说不对吧！”
    大家算了算账，一斤莜面一角五，做成河涝能卖六角五，三倍多的利润。许多人质问：“你向国家要了粮食，做成河涝高价剥削人，自己发了财，还昧着良心说不够吃。像你这样，有多少粮食够你投机倒把？”
    到这时，窦占元才承认了自己的错误，检讨了想靠投机发财的资本主义思想，表示今后和大家一同执行统购统销政策。
    王存扣想不劳而获  难怪他说今不如昔
    在讨论合作化到底优越不优越时，一些富裕中农认为合作社不如单干，王存扣就是这类人的代表。他说：“明明不如以前，总要说比过去强，你们说好，我就认为不好；要不是合作社和统购统销，我的生活早就比过去好了几倍了。”
    许多人一齐站起来要和王存扣辩理，主持会议的人说：“大家坐下来，一个说了一个再说。”赵来运指着王存扣说：“你说现在不如以前，你倒忘了过去咱村的‘十多’了，我再给你说说：一是没地少地的人多。几户地主富农占了三千四百多亩地，六百六十二户农民占不到一半，现在都是土地的主人。二是扛长工的人多。全村有一百五十多个扛长工的，现在一个也没有了。三是没房住的人多。一百多户住的庙院、破窑，有的还在街上，如今都有了房子住。四是讨吃挨饿的人多。有一百多人讨吃，一百五十多人挨饿，现在大家都能吃饱。五是抽大烟白面儿的人多。这种人全村有七百多个，现在一个也没有了。六是卖儿卖女卖老婆的多。我知道的就有二十四个，现在一个也没有了。七是披麻袋、草包的人多。过去有一百多个，现在人人都是有新有旧。八是偷盗多。那种社会逼的穷人没路子，有一百多人干过这败兴事，现在都是好人了。九是耍钱赌博多。咱村有六百多个赌博的，现在一个也没有了。十是各种限制多。那时候，出门走路都不随便，现在的人民才真正自由了。这怎能说现在不如过去？”
    王存扣还是不服，他硬着说：“别人好，我不好。我以前种二十四亩地，平常年景也打二十五石粮食，四口人，有吃有穿有钱花。现在动弹一年，除了吃，连二十元钱也拿不回来，这怎能说……。”
    “原来你是说这个，”王庆明打断王存扣的话说：“你那底子我知道，你过去怎么好的？每年用牲口换一百多个人工，出租一亩土地能得两石多租，不是你自己劳动来的！你还想那样？”停了停又说：“就说你的收入吧，那时候，就你那个当家，加上剥削，一年也不过是一百三十来元钱的进项，苛捐杂税就得拿去三分之一。现在，你俩口子一年也做二百五十个劳动日，净得二百五十多元钱，这还不比你过去强？”
    牛学贵也说：“我家是老婆汉子俩口人劳动，一年能做四百五十多个劳动日；你也是老婆汉子俩口人劳动，一年连三百个劳动日都做不到； 如果要不想过去，好好劳动，你的收入还会多。”
    许多人说：“对呀，不想劳动，光想过好日子，那能行。”“存扣的生活不是不如过去，是他不想劳动。”
    这时候，生产队长说话了：“你想你的路，大家想大家的路，如果照你的路走，少数人富了，多数人又得受穷，你也不敢保险自己不穷。合作社才搞了二年，大多数人的生活都比过去好多了，再过几年还会更好。”王存扣在大家帮助下，终于承认了自己的错误。他表示说：“我走错路了，今后看吧，总要和大家一起办好咱的合作社”。第二天即找队长给他分配工作。
    史福昌翻身忘本　竟忘了昔不如今
    在辩论社会主义经济制度究竟好不好时，新富裕中农史福昌说：“你们说这也好，那也好，怎么粮食不能随便吃，布也不能随便买，烧饼、麻叶、糖什么的，总是不够？”
    赵来运指着史福昌说：“兄弟，你从小东岢（村名）怎么来宗艾的？”
    “一担担来的吧！”史福昌无意地回答说。
    “对呀！”赵来运接着说：“那时候，你一担就担来个人家，房没房，地没地，整整扛了十八年长工。那时候，粮食倒随便吃，可你一年能吃多少？不用说三百六，就二百六你也买不起呀。那时候，布能随便买，你扯过多少？就是二年你能穿一丈布的话，也算不错。那时候，街上的烧饼、麻叶、糖倒不少，你吃了几个？还不就是看一看，落个眼饱肚里饥。解放后，你才分了房，分了地。现在入了高级社，光景过得好了，想买的东西多了，别人也一样呀。农民生活好了，工人生活也好了，就说你的三个儿子和媳妇吧，都是工人，不也是一样吗？过去大多数穷人买不起，东西就多；现在大家生活都好了，都想买东西，自然东西就少了，就得分着吃，分着穿，分着用。现在这样大家分着吃用，总比那时候有东西买不起强吧。”
    “润八哥（润八是赵来运的小名）！”史福昌站起来叫了一声说：“我的看法不对，一碗水泼到地下，收不起来了，你们以后看吧。”
