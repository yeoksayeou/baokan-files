    Jiangsu Basically Eliminates Kala-azar

    (By our reporter) Kala-azar, which has plagued the people of northern Jiangsu for seventy or eighty years, has now been basically eliminated.

    Before liberation, the epidemic of kala-azar in the twenty-four cities and counties of the three special districts of Huaiyin, Xuzhou, and Yancheng in northern Jiangsu was extremely serious. In key areas, almost every family had one or two patients. According to historical records, in the Huaiyin area from 1930 to 1940, about 80% of the villages had kala-azar patients, with a household infection rate of 83%. In the villages with the highest incidence, 4% to 5% of the population died of kala-azar every year.

    After liberation, the Central Ministry of Health organized epidemic prevention teams to conduct general surveys and prevention and treatment in the Xuzhou and Huaiyin areas. At the same time, work to eliminate the vector of transmission, sandflies, was widely carried out in the affected areas. According to statistics, as of June this year, the province has treated more than 111,000 kala-azar patients, leaving only about 2,000 patients. At present, the prevention and treatment work has entered the final stage. (Wei)

    江苏基本消灭黑热病
    本报讯　为害苏北人民达七八十年的黑热病，现在已基本消灭了。
    江苏北部淮阴、徐州、盐城三个专区二十四个市县，解放前黑热病流行程度极为严重，重点地区几乎家家有一两个病人。据历史材料记载，淮阴地区在1930年至1940年，约有80％的村庄内都有黑热病人，户口感染率达83％。患病率最高的村庄，每年有4％至5％的人口死于黑热病。
    解放后，中央卫生部即组织防疫大队到徐州、淮阴一带进行普查和防治，同时在病区普遍开展消灭传染媒介——百蛉子的工作。据统计：到今年6月为止，全省已治疗了黑热病患者十一万一千多人，现在只剩下了二千左右的病人。目前，防治工作已进入扫尾阶段。　（韦）
