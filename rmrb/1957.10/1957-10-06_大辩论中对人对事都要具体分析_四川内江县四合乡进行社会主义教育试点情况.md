Analyze People and Matters Specifically in the Great Debate
——The Socialist Education Pilot Program in Sihe Township, Neijiang County, Sichuan
Zhang Li, First Secretary of the Neijiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Sichuan Province

Sihe Township is a small township with more than 1,300 households, close to the urban area of Neijiang City. Its main agricultural products are sugarcane and grain. In the entire Neijiang area, it belongs to a Class I economic zone. By the autumn of 1956, all households in the township had joined advanced cooperatives, with 98.1% of the total households participating. Agricultural production has increased year after year. In 1956, the average grain yield per unit area in the township reached 845 catties, and sugarcane reached more than 6,200 catties. The actual grain retention level of farmers has increased year after year, with an average of 578 catties per person in 1954, 619 catties in 1955, and 682 catties in 1956. The lives of the vast majority of farmers are relatively affluent.

Due to weak political and ideological work, since last autumn, capitalist, individualist, and departmentalist ideas have been growing among cadres and members. 1956 was a year of great harvest, with an average increase of 15.44% in grain production across the township, but only 70% of the state's assigned purchase tasks were completed, a decrease of 22% compared with the actual purchase tasks completed in 1955. More seriously, the Party organization began to erode, and the leadership of a vegetable cooperative's branch committee and cooperative committee deteriorated. Five probationary Party members requested to withdraw from the Party and the cooperative. (There were a total of eighty-three Party members in the township, one general branch, and four branches.) Many cadres and masses wanted to abandon agriculture and engage in business. Twenty-six cooperative cadres requested resignation, accounting for 10.3%.

The pilot work in this township was carried out under the direct leadership of the Prefectural Committee, starting in early August and basically ending in mid-September, lasting a total of forty-five days. Because the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries in the countryside was quite rampant at that time, and the thinking of cadres and masses was confused, we first conducted education against complacency and right-leaning tendencies among Party members, cadres, and activists. Then, we boldly mobilized the masses to expose the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, and launched a reasoned struggle.

The township had a total of 136 landlord, rich peasant, and counter-revolutionary households. Among them, 39 households had illegal and seriously illegal destructive activities. We adopted a method that closely combined mass struggle with court trials, timely supported the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle, brought into play the mass line of judicial work, prevented and avoided simple and crude phenomena of suspension and beatings, and also overcame the ideological style of judicial cadres handling cases behind closed doors.

Issues Revealed During Airing Views Should Be Analyzed Specifically

After righteousness rose in the countryside, the masses were immediately mobilized to air their views freely, with the participation rate generally reaching about 80% of the total farming households. Well performing cooperatives reached over 90%.

Judging from the depth of airing views, about 85% or more of the people aired views thoroughly. A total of more than 5,400 opinions were put forward in the township, with an average of more than three opinions raised per person based on the number of participants. These opinions were recorded in the meetings and posted on bulletin boards after being sorted out. Twelve small cliques were also exposed during the airing of views, including: two groups engaged in speculative trading, five groups making trouble to withdraw from the cooperative, two groups engaged in corruption and theft, two groups engaged in gambling, and one group concealing production.

The opinions raised were mainly concentrated in four areas: grain, the relationship between workers and peasants, cooperativization, and the relationship between cadres and the masses. Among them, the grain problem was the most prominent. More than 90% of the attendees had opinions on grain. 70%-80% of the people had opinions on the relationship between workers and peasants. 20%-30% of the people expressed doubts and wavering about cooperativization. 81 households openly proposed to withdraw from the cooperative, accounting for 5.8% of the total cooperative member households (of which wealthy households accounted for 68%).

Among the opinions raised, 30% were reasonable or basically reasonable. 35% were one-sided. 25% were wrong. 10% were anti-socialist and reactionary.

On the grain issue, they did not talk about actual grain distribution, but only about the fixed quota standard, saying: 440 catties of grain is not enough to eat; sweet potatoes have to be peeled, and millet has to be shelled, where can you get 440 catties? Our farmers have big bellies and need to eat three 440 catties a year. The government's warehouses are full of grain, why do you still want so much public grain and unified purchase grain from the farmers?

On the relationship between workers and peasants, they said that sugarcane only costs more than 100 yuan per 10,000 catties, while sugar sells for more than 6 jiao per catty, saying that sugar factories exploit them. Workers have high wages and good living standards, while farmers have low incomes and low living standards. "Workers are in heaven, farmers are in hell," etc.

Regarding the opinions on cooperativization, they said that after joining the cooperative, money is tight, grain is tight, and work is tight. They demanded more private plots, more side occupations, more business, and more holidays. Some people also said: If cooperativization has advantages, it is that the state can complete the purchase easily, issue an order, and take as much as it wants.

A large part of these opinions come from individualism, departmentalism, and extreme egalitarianism, and some are incited by bad elements. For example, there are the most opinions on grain, but most of them want to eat more fine grains (rice). Therefore, these remarks must be analyzed specifically. At that time, we determined three principles for analyzing these opinions: class background, political attitude, and the nature of the remarks. Among them, the consistent political attitude of supporting or opposing the leadership of the Party, supporting or opposing cooperativization, was the main factor. The results of ranking according to these three principles are as follows: Those who firmly supported it were in the first category, accounting for 32% (of which the original poor and lower-middle peasants accounted for 85%); those who basically supported it were in the second category, accounting for 58.8% (of which the original poor and lower-middle peasants accounted for 82.6%, old lower-middle peasants accounted for 8.9%, and old upper-middle peasants accounted for 8.2%); those who had great doubts about cooperativization, were dissatisfied or severely dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sale of grain, engaged in commercial speculation, organized or led trouble over grain and cooperatives were in the third category, accounting for 9.1% (of which poor peasants accounted for 5.4%, lower-middle peasants accounted for 24.6%, new upper-middle peasants accounted for 38.2%, old upper-middle peasants accounted for 31.8%, and some were original urban poor); anti-socialist elements who insisted on taking the capitalist road, opposed and sabotaged cooperativization and the unified purchase and sale of grain, accounted for 2.1% (of which poor peasants accounted for 4%, lower-middle peasants accounted for 8%, new upper-middle peasants accounted for 40%, and old upper-middle peasants accounted for 48%). In this way, the nature of the problem and the political and ideological camp roughly presented an outline.

In the process of airing views, there were two relatively obvious characteristics. One was that the original poor and hired peasants aired their views first. They aired their views quickly and transformed quickly. The old upper-middle peasants aired their views slowly and transformed slowly. Secondly, when the airing of views reached its peak, it naturally caused fierce division and fierce ideological struggle, and the class lineup and political lineup gradually unfolded. Some of the original poor and hired peasants, now poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and some Party members and cadres with relatively high awareness, began to regret that they should not have aired their views randomly without basis. Some could not sleep for several nights after airing their views. Some expressed righteous indignation at the erroneous remarks of random saying and random airing of views. Some launched fierce ideological struggles between father and son, husband and wife, forming a natural climax of debate. For example, there was a new middle peasant named Yang Shaozhong. Before liberation, he had no fields or land. His father worked for the landlord and died from exhaustion. His mother remarried due to livelihood. His younger brother starved to death. His fiancee was seized by the landlord and could not marry. After liberation, he was given fields and land. His original fiancee married him and now lives as a middle peasant. In the airing of views, he said that 440 catties of grain was not enough to eat and that 200 catties of yellow millet refined grains was too little, saying that the grain distributed by the cooperative now was not as much as he had harvested from the edges of the fields in the past. After returning home, his wife asked him what he had aired. He told his wife what he had said. His wife questioned him face to face: "Where did you get the edges of the fields in the past? Where did you harvest grain from? You are really telling lies against your conscience." Yang Shaozhong was speechless. When this kind of debate atmosphere has a broad mass character, the conditions for the great debate are already mature, and it is timely to turn to the great contention.

Through Great Contention and Great Debate, Get to the Bottom of Things

Before turning to the great debate and great contention, in order to form the core leadership in the great debate and make the debate more powerful, a four-day debate conference for backbone elements was held in the township. The combat effectiveness of the backbone elements was trained and cultivated. Then, the great debate was fully launched.

In the stage of fully entering the great debate and great contention, the main focus was on debating the following issues.

The first is whether cooperativization has advantages. Is cooperativization good or is individual farming good? There were 18 individual farmers in the township. Although they only accounted for 1.3% of the total farming households, we relaxed our leadership over them after cooperativization, especially some old upper-middle peasants. They not only engaged in speculation, exploited hired labor, and defaulted on public grain, but also frequently used the wavering emotions of some wealthy cooperative members to promote the superiority of individual farming. For example, they said that individual farming has freedom of planting, freedom of eating grain, freedom of working, freedom of doing business, freedom of reporting production, and freedom of paying public grain and selling surplus grain, etc., which are poisonous capitalist ideas.

Therefore, in addition to calculating the production increase of the cooperative and the comparison of production income of cooperative members before and after joining the cooperative, the focus of the debate was also on calculating the comparison of output and grain consumption between the cooperative and individual farming households. The illegal behavior of individual farming households was exposed and criticized. The results of the calculation show that the comparison of the average yield per area of several crops in the township in 1956 with the yield of 18 individual farming households is as follows:

		Yellow Millet	Corn	Sweet Potato	Sugarcane
		(Rice)	(Corn)	(Sweet Potato)
Individual Farming Households	467	289	1,516	4,969
Township	498	305	2,912	6,273

In terms of grain consumption, individual farming households generally consumed about 400 catties, with the most consuming household, the old upper-middle peasant Xiao Bingquan, averaging 508 catties per person. The average actual grain distribution level of the cooperative last year was 682 catties. As a result, the mystery of individual farming households having high output, consuming more grain, and individual farming being superior to cooperatives was exposed. Many cooperative members reflected that we originally thought individual farming was good, but we only calculated half of the account.

The debate revealed that individual farming households had widespread illegal behavior. Among the 18 individual farming households, 11 households exploited hired labor. They concealed production, averaging 4.6% of the cultivated land area. Last year, they paid 502 catties less public grain and sold more than 3,100 catties less surplus grain. They also used our lax market management to carry out various speculative activities. This completely exposed the ugly behavior of the so-called freedom of individual farming.

The second is the grain issue. Is the fixed quota standard of 440 catties reasonable? Farmers with higher awareness, used their own experiences to fully calculate production, needs, grain storage, and grain shortage accounts. They calculated the comparison between saving grain and wasting grain. A fierce debate struggle unfolded. The result of the debate was the general acknowledgment that if attention is paid to saving, 440 catties of grain is not only enough to eat, but also has a surplus. During the debate, according to the self-report statistics of 395 cooperative members, surplus grain households accounted for 42.5%, households with enough grain accounted for more than 47%. Due to unplanned grain consumption and waste of grain, households with some grain shortage accounted for 9.8%. For example, an old upper-middle peasant named Fan Chisheng had been claiming grain shortage and shouted loudly during the airing of views that 440 catties were not enough to eat. During the debate, according to his personal self-report, he still had 203 catties of old rice, 212 catties of wheat, and more than 20 catties of broad beans before the autumn harvest. The peas he distributed had not been touched, and the old corn had been infested with insects.

The third is the issue of the relationship between workers and peasants. When the airing of views began, the responsible comrades of the local relevant enterprises went to listen to the opinions aired. At the beginning of the debate, the relevant units answered the reasonable opinions raised (such as the start and stop time of the sugar factory, sugarcane transportation, weighing, supply and marketing, grain inspection, business hours, etc.), and made necessary explanations for the one-sided opinions.

Secondly, during the debate, farmers were also organized to visit the production and living conditions of sugar factories and railway workers, and workers were invited to participate in the debate. The specific circumstances of the workers' production and living were introduced in detail. For example, in terms of living, a railway worker named Cai Changde had a family of five. Before the wage reform last year, his monthly income was 40 yuan. After the wage reform, it was 48 yuan, averaging 9.6 jiao per person per month. The family's monthly food expenses were 35.6 jiao, with a surplus of more than 12 yuan. In addition to rent and utilities, they also had to supplement the family's clothing. It was not much richer than the life of a middle peasant. In terms of grain consumption, Cai, as a heavy manual laborer, had an average monthly quota of 98 catties of rice, averaging more than 19 catties per person, equivalent to 28 catties of millet. The average annual consumption of yellow millet per person was 330 catties, which was still lower than the farmer's grain retention level of 440 catties.

As a result of this calculation and debate, many farmers said: We originally did not understand the actual situation of workers' lives. The erroneous statement that "workers are in heaven, farmers are in hell" was also refuted.

During the airing of views, those who expressed serious resistance and dissatisfaction with socialism accounted for 8.21% of the total number of farming households, including 15 Party members, 7 Youth League members, 12 non-Party cadres, and 72 general cooperative members. From the perspective of class, old upper-middle peasants accounted for 31.8%, new upper-middle peasants accounted for 38.2%, lower-middle peasants accounted for 24.6%, and poor peasants accounted for 5.4%. After criticism and education, 70.9% of those who reviewed and admitted their mistakes well and expressed their determination to correct them, and 29.1% had a general understanding of their own mistakes and made a review.

In the entire process of great airing of views and great contention, a total of 25 anti-socialist elements were exposed, accounting for 1.87% of the total number of farming households. Among these 25 people, from the perspective of class, 12 were old upper-middle peasants, accounting for 48%, 10 were new upper-middle peasants, accounting for 40%, 2 were new lower-middle peasants, accounting for 8%, and 1 was a poor peasant, accounting for 4%.

From the perspective of political and historical situation, there was 1 puppet military officer, 4 puppet township chiefs, 5 ruffians, 4 rogue soldiers, 1 puppet military, police, and landlord supervisor each, 1 landlord who changed his class status, and the remaining 6 were all old upper-middle peasants.

From the perspective of the nature of the problem, 13 belonged to anti-socialist elements who insisted on taking the capitalist road. These people were instigators and leaders in making trouble over grain and withdrawing from the cooperative, engaging in commercial speculative activities, disrupting market prices, and were the promoters and organizers of wholeheartedly longing for the capitalist road. 10 belonged to bad elements of social dregs. They were stealing and destroying, were tyrannical and domineering, seriously endangering social order and the interests of the cooperative, and were most hated by the masses. 2 belonged to historical reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries (1 puppet battalion commander and 1 puppet chief each). For example, the puppet battalion commander Yu Xiewu was sentenced to two years in prison after liberation for participating in the Yiguandao activity. After serving his sentence, he sneaked into the production team as a scorekeeper. During the airing of views, he manipulated the meeting and incited cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperative, causing chaos in the fourth team during the airing of views.

The above-mentioned anti-socialist elements were all dealt with separately.

Draw a Clear Line, Enhance Awareness, and Fully Turn to Production

Through this great debate, the broad masses further drew a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, the line between socialism and capitalism, and the line between good people and bad people. They overcame the right-leaning complacency of Party members and cadres and purified the grass-roots organizations. During the debate, 196 debate backbones emerged in the township. Righteousness rose, evil subsided, which powerfully promoted work and production, overcame individualism, departmentalism, and extreme egalitarianism among cadres and the masses, and severely cracked down on the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. All rural work cadres were also deeply educated. At the end of the airing of views, the state's assigned purchase task for this year increased by 52% compared with the actual completion number last year, and was completed in just ten days.

At present, the township has turned to the production movement. Every household is formulating plans for saving grain and plans for family sideline production. All 18 cooperative members who had openly requested to withdraw from the cooperative during the airing of views reviewed and expressed their determination not to withdraw from the cooperative again. The 26 cadres who had originally requested to resign and the five probationary Party members who had requested to withdraw from the Party also reviewed their mistakes and expressed that they would no longer waver. He Yousheng, who had been doing silver shell (superstition goods) business, voluntarily handed over the printing plate to the agricultural cooperative, expressing that he would no longer do this kind of improper thing in the future.

    大辩论中对人对事都要具体分析
    ——四川内江县四合乡进行社会主义教育试点情况
    中共四川省内江地委第一书记　张励
    四合乡是一个一千三百多户人家的小乡，靠近内江市郊区，主要农产品为甘蔗和粮食，在内江全区来说，属于一类经济区。这个乡在1956年秋全部转入高级社，入社农户占总农户的98.1％。农业生产连年增产，1956年全乡粮食单位面积产量平均已达八百四十五斤，甘蔗六千二百多斤。农民实际留粮水平连年上升，1954年每人平均五百七十八斤，1955年六百一十九斤，1956年六百八十二斤。绝大多数农民的生活比较富裕。
    由于政治思想工作薄弱，自去秋以来，在干部、社员中的资本主义和个人主义、本位主义思想在滋长。1956年是个大丰收年，全乡粮食平均增产15.44％，但是对国家分配的征购任务仅完成70％，比1955年实际完成的征购任务，还减少了22％。更严重的是党的组织开始腐蚀，一个蔬菜社的分支委和社委领导变质。有五个候补党员要求退党退社。（乡里共有党员八十三人，一个总支、四个分支。）不少干部群众想弃农经商。社干部要求辞职的二十六人，占10.3％。
    这个乡试点工作是在地委直接领导下进行的，从8月初开始到9月中旬基本结束，历时共四十五天。因为当时农村反革命的破坏相当嚣张，干部群众思想混乱，我们先在党员、干部和积极分子中进行了反对麻痹右倾的教育，随即放手发动群众，揭发地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏活动，开展了说理斗争。
    全乡共有地主、富农、反革命分子一百三十六户，其中，有违法和严重违法破坏活动行为的三十九户，我们采用了群众斗争与法庭审判密切结合的方法，及时地支持了群众的斗争热情，发挥了司法工作的群众路线，防止和避免了简单粗糙的吊、打现象，也克服了司法干部关门办案的思想作风。
    鸣放出来的问题要具体分析
    在农村中正气上升以后，立即发动群众大鸣大放，参加鸣放的面一般达到了总农户的80％左右。放的好的社达到90％以上。
    从鸣放的深度看，约有85％以上的人是放透了的。全乡共提出意见五千四百多条，按参加会议人数统计，每人平均提了意见三条多。这些意见，在会议中记录下来，经过整理都贴榜公布了。鸣放中还揭露出十二个小集团。其中：做投机买卖集团二个，闹退社集团五个，贪污盗窃集团二个，赌博集团二个，瞒产集团一个。
    放出的意见，主要是集中在粮食、工农关系、合作化、干群关系四个方面。其中又以粮食问题最为突出。对粮食有意见的人，占到会人数90％以上。对工农关系有意见的人占70％—80％。对合作化表示有怀疑、动摇的人占20％—30％。公开提出要退社的八十一户，占总社员户的5.8％（其中富裕户占68％）。
    所提意见中，合理与基本合理的占30％。有片面性的占35％。错误的占25％。反社会主义的反动意见占10％。
    在粮食问题上，他们不谈实际分粮，只谈定量标准，说：粮食四百四十斤不够吃，红薯要打皮、谷子要去壳，那里还有四百四十斤。我们农民肚皮大，一年要吃三个四百四十斤。政府仓库里的粮食堆的满满的，为啥还要向农民要那样多公粮、统购粮。
    在工农关系上说，甘蔗每万斤才一百多元，糖，每斤卖六角多，说糖厂剥削他们。工人工资多，生活好，农民收入少，生活低。“工人在天堂，农民在地狱”等。
    对合作化的意见，说入社后钱紧、粮紧、活路紧，要求多留自留地，多搞副业，多做生意，多放假休息。有人还说：如果说合作化有优越性，那就是国家好完成征购，下个命令，要多少、拿多少。
    放出来的这些意见中，有很大一部分是从个人主义、本位主义、极端平均主义出发的，有的是受了坏分子的挑动。比如对粮食的意见是最多的。但多数是想多吃些细粮（大米）。因此，对这些言论，必须进行具体分析。我们当时确定了分析这些意见的三条原则是：阶级成分，政治态度，言论性质。其中尤以拥护与反对党的领导，拥护与反对合作化的一贯政治态度为主。根据这样的三条原则排队的结果是这样的。坚决拥护的为第一类，占32％（其中原来的贫雇农占85％）；基本拥护的为第二类，占58.8％（其中原为贫雇农占82.6％，老下中农占8.9％，老上中农占8.2％。）；对合作化抱有很大的怀疑态度，不满或严重地不满意粮食统购统销，进行商业投机活动，组织或带头闹粮闹社为第三类，占9.1％（其中贫农占5.4％，下中农占24.6％，新上中农占38.2％，老上中农占31.8％，个别是原城市贫民）；坚持要走资本主义道路，反对与破坏合作化和粮食统购统销的反社会主义分子，占2.1％（其中贫农占4％，下中农占8％，新上中农占40％，老上中农占48％）。这样问题的性质和政治思想阵营就大体呈现出了一个轮廓来。
    在鸣放的过程中，有两个比较明显的特点。一个是原来为贫雇的农民先放。他们放的快，转变的也快。老上中农放的慢，转的也慢。其次，当鸣放达到高峰的时候，即很自然的引起激烈的分化和激烈的思想斗争，阶级阵容和政治阵容也就逐步摆开。有些原来的贫雇农现在的贫农和下中农，及一部分觉悟比较高的党员、干部，开始后悔自己不该无根据的乱放。有的放了以后几夜睡不着觉。有的对乱说乱放的错误言论表示义愤不平。有的父子之间、夫妇之间展开激烈的思想斗争，形成一种自然的争辩高潮。例如，有这样一个新中农叫杨绍中，解放前无田、无土，父亲给地主帮工累死了，母亲因生活所迫改了嫁，弟弟饿死，他的未婚妻被地主霸占不能结婚。解放后，他分了田、土，原来的未婚妻又与他结了婚，现在过着中农生活。在鸣放中他说四百四十斤粮食不够吃，二百斤黄谷细粮太少了，说现在合作社分的粮食，还没有他过去田边地角上收的多。回家以后，他老婆问他，放了些啥子？他把放的原话讲给老婆听了，他老婆当面责问他：“你过去哪里来的田边地角？从哪一块田边地角上收来过粮食？你真是昧着良心说假话。”说的杨绍中无言可答。这种争辩空气已具有广泛群众性的时候，大辩论的条件就已经成熟了，就及时转入大争。
    通过大争大辩搞个水落石出
    在转入大辩大争之前，为了组成大辩论中的核心领导，使争论开展的更加有力，全乡召开了四天的骨干分子辩论大会。锻炼培养了骨干分子的战斗力。随即全面展开了大辩论。
    在全面进入大辩大争阶段，主要集中争辩了以下几个问题。
    第一个是合作化有没有优越性？合作化好，还是单干好？全乡共有单干农民十八户。他们虽然仅占总农户的1.3％，但由于合作化后我们放松了对他们的领导，特别是有一部分老上中农，他们不仅进行投机取巧活动，雇工剥削，拖欠公粮，还在经常利用一部分富裕社员的动摇情绪，宣扬单干的优越性。如说，单干有种植自由、吃粮自由、出工自由、做买卖自由、报产自由、交公粮、售余粮自由等等资本主义思想毒素。
    因此，争辩的中心，除了算合作社的增产账和社员入社前后生产收入的对比账以外，还着重算了社与单干农户产量、吃粮的对比账。并对单干户的违法行为，进行了揭露和批判斗争。算账的结果，1956年全乡几种作物的面积平均产量与十八户单干户的产量对比情况是这样的数字：
              黄谷　苞谷　红苕　甘蔗
              （稻）　（玉米）　（甘薯）
    单干户　　467　　289　　1，516　　4，969
    全　乡　　498　　305　　2，912　　6，273
    在吃粮方面，单干户一般为四百斤左右，吃粮最多的一户老上中农萧炳权，每人才平均五百零八斤。而合作社去年平均实际分粮水平为六百八十二斤。这样一来，单干户产量高，吃粮多，单干比合作社优越的谜底被揭穿了。很多的社员反映，我们原来认为单干好，是算了半边账。
    在辩论中揭发出单干户带有普遍的违法行为。十八户单干农民中，十一户有雇工剥削。他们隐瞒产量，平均占田地面积的4.6％。去年少交公粮五百零二斤，少卖余粮三千一百多斤。并利用我们市场管理不严进行种种投机倒贩活动。这样就把所谓单干自由的丑恶行为完全暴露了。
    第二个是粮食问题。四百四十斤的定量标准，合理不合理？觉悟较高的农民，现身说法，全面进行算生产、需要、存粮、缺粮账。算节约用粮与浪费粮食的对比账。展开了激烈的争辩斗争。争辩的结果，普遍承认，四百四十斤粮食如果注意节约，不仅够吃，而且有余。在争辩中，据三百九十五户社员自报统计，余粮户占42.5％，足吃够用户占47％以上，由于吃粮无计划，浪费了粮食，以致缺些粮的占9.8％。例如，有一户老上中农叫范池盛，一直闹缺粮，在鸣放中大喊大叫四百四十斤不够吃。争辩中经他个人自报，在秋收前尚存有老谷子二百零三斤，麦子二百十二斤，葫豆二十多斤，分的豌豆还一颗未动，老苞谷生了虫。
    第三个是工农关系问题。当鸣放开始，当地有关企业单位的负责同志都去听取鸣放的意见。在辩论开始，各有关单位对鸣放中提出的合理意见，分别作了解答（如糖厂开工、停工的时间、甘蔗运输、过秤、供销、粮食的验级、营业时间等），对片面性的意见，作了必要的解释。
    其次，在争辩中又组织农民参观访问了糖厂、铁路工人的生产、生活情况，并约请工人参加了争辩会。把工人生产与生活方面的具体情况，进行了详细介绍。例如，在生活方面，一个铁路工人叫蔡长德，全家五口人，去年工资改革前，每月收入为四十元。工资改革后为四十八元，每人每月平均为九元六角。全家每月吃饭开支为三十五元六角，余十二元多点，除房租、水电开支外，还要添补全家衣服。并不比中农生活富裕多少。在吃粮方面，蔡是个重体力劳动，全家平均每月定量供应大米九十八斤，每人平均十九斤多，折谷二十八斤。全年每人平均吃黄谷三百三十斤，尚低于农民留粮四百四十斤的水平。
    这样算账争辩的结果，许多农民说：我们原来是不了解工人生活的实际情况，这样“工人在天堂，农民在地狱”的错误言论，也被驳倒了。
    在鸣放中暴露出对社会主义有严重抵触不满情绪的占总农户人数的8.21％，其中党员十五人，团员七人，非党干部十二人，一般社员七十二人。从阶层上看，老上中农占31.8％，新上中农占38.2％，下中农占24.6％，贫农占5.4％，经过批判教育之后，检讨承认错误好，表示决心改正的占70.9％，对自己的错误言行有一般认识，并作了检讨的占29.1％。
    全部大放大鸣和大争过程中，共揭露出反社会主义分子二十五人，占总农户的1.87％，这二十五人中，从阶层上看，老上中农十二人，占48％，新上中农十人占40％，新下中农二人，占8％，贫农一人，占4％。
    从政治历史情况看，伪军官一人，伪乡保长四人，流氓五人，兵痞四人，伪军、警、地主管事各一人，改变成分的地主一人，其余六人都是老上中农。
    从问题性质上看，属于坚持走资本主义道路的反社会主义分子十三人，这类人是煽动和带头闹粮、闹退社，进行商业投机活动，捣乱市场物价，是一心向往资本主义道路的鼓舞者和组织者。属于社会渣滓的坏分子十人，他们是偷窃破坏，豪强霸道，严重违害社会治安和合作社利益，群众也最为痛恨。属于历史上的反动分子和反革命分子二人（伪营长、保长各一）。如伪营长余协武，解放后曾因参加一贯道活动被判二年徒刑，刑满释放后混进生产队当记分员，在鸣放中操纵会场，煽动社员退社，造成四队在鸣放中一度混乱。
    对以上的反社会主义分子，都分别作了处理。
    划清界限提高觉悟全力转入生产
    经过这一场大辩论，广大群众进一步划清了敌我界限，社会主义和资本主义的界限，好人和坏人的界限，克服了党员干部中的右倾麻痹思想，纯洁了基层组织。在争辩中，全乡涌现出来一百九十六个辩论骨干，正气上升，邪气收敛，有力地推动了工作与生产，克服了干部群众中的个人主义、本位主义、极端平均主义，严重打击了地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子的破坏活动。所有农村工作干部也都受到了一次深刻的教育。在鸣放结束的时候，该乡今年国家分配的征购任务，比去年实际完成数字增加52％，而且仅以十天时间全部完成。
      目前全乡已转入生产运动，家家户户都在制订节约用粮计划，制订家庭副业生产计划。鸣放中曾经公开要求退社的十八户社员，全部进行了检讨，表示决心再不退社了。原来要求辞职的二十六个干部和要求退党退社的五个预备党员，也检讨了错误、表示再不动摇了。一贯做银壳子（迷信品）生意的何友盛，自动地把印板交给农业社，表示今后再不做这种不正当的事情了。
