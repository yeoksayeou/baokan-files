　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 22nd. The Preparatory Committee for the Asian-African Solidarity Conference held its first meeting in Cairo on the morning of October 21st. Egyptian representative Anwar Sadat was elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, and Indian representative Anup Singh and Japanese representative Sunada Nao were elected as Vice-Chairmen.

　　This meeting will determine the date for the Asian-African Solidarity Conference to be held in Cairo and establish the conference secretariat. Representatives from twenty-one countries attended the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee, namely: Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ceylon, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Mongolia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Algeria, Cameroon, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Thirty-eight Asian and African countries have already been invited to participate in the upcoming Asian-African Solidarity Conference.

　　Anwar Sadat, in his capacity as Chairman of the Egyptian Committee for the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, welcomed the representatives at the first meeting on the morning of October 21st. Sadat said that Egypt, from its painful experience, recognizes that destroying imperialism is the decisive step towards realizing the world's hopes for peace and justice.

　　Sadat said that the Asian and African peoples, who have made significant contributions to the history of human civilization, have long been unable to exert any influence on international affairs, and indeed cannot decide their own destiny. Now, however, they have emerged as a new force, and they do not wish to provoke war and chaos, but only to build peace and security. Therefore, the representatives of these countries should come together to seek understanding and cooperation in order to lay the solemn foundation for a new life for humanity. “We laid the foundation and made a start in Bandung, but it needs to be developed and expanded. This is the task of this conference.”

　　At the afternoon meeting, the suggestion of Indian representative Dr. Anup Singh was unanimously adopted, deciding to send a telegram expressing support for Syria's struggle, and at the same time send a copy of the telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.

　　The Preparatory Committee has established two subcommittees, responsible for considering the proposed agenda for the current Preparatory Committee meeting and the upcoming Asian-African Solidarity Conference, and for making the necessary arrangements for the upcoming conference. The two subcommittees will submit their recommendations to the plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee.

　　Most of the representatives spoke at the morning and afternoon meetings, expressing welcome for the proposition of promoting cooperation and solidarity between the peoples of Asian and African countries. China, Sudan and many other countries expressed their support for the struggle of the Syrian people for independence and freedom.

　　The representative of Cameroon has requested that the Cameroon issue be included on the conference agenda.

　　The representatives of the countries participating in the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee attended a banquet held by the Egyptian Committee for the Asian-African Solidarity Conference on the evening of October 21st.
