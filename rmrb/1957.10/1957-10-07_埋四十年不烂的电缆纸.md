    Cable Paper That Doesn't Rot After Being Buried for Forty Years

    A type of high-grade industrial paper—cable paper—has been successfully trial-produced at the newly built state-owned Jiamusi Integrated Pulp and Paper Mill.

    Cable paper is the external insulation protective layer for underground cables. It is only 0.12 millimeters thick, but it can be folded two thousand times by hand without breaking and can be buried underground for forty years without rotting.

    埋四十年不烂的电缆纸
    一种高级工业用纸——电缆纸，已在新建国营佳木斯综合纸浆造纸厂试制成功。
    电缆纸是地下电缆线的外部绝缘保护层，它的厚度只有零点一二公厘，可是，用手折叠两千次都不会断，能在地下埋藏四十年不腐烂。
