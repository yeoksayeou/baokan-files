    Ruthlessness and Sentimentality
    Fu Jing
    Almost all rightists, big and small, have chorused to curse the new society, saying "There is no true feeling between people" and "The Communist Party is cold-blooded and ruthless, not recognizing relatives." Some people have a vague understanding and cannot distinguish between right and wrong, and they also shout along. It can be seen that the issue of emotion is a major issue of right and wrong, not just a matter of love between men and women or friendship between friends.
    Is having feelings right and being ruthless wrong? Not necessarily. Conversely, is having feelings wrong and being ruthless right? Not necessarily either. The right and wrong here must be specifically evaluated according to specific people and things, and more importantly, based on the evaluator's position.
    The film "Unquenchable Flame," based on factual events, shows the traitor Jiang Er ravaging his hometown, persecuting his mother, and resolutely putting his younger brother to death. He abuses the people to his heart's content, and is cruelly ruthless. This is the characteristic of a traitorous national scum. The anti-Japanese hero Jiang San initially tried every means to persuade Jiang Er to abandon his evil ways and join the resistance against Japan. This intention and effort showed that the revolutionaries treated people with the utmost kindness, and was very sentimental, and it was correct. Later, Jiang San personally shot and killed Jiang Er, which showed his utter ruthlessness towards scum and his commitment to upholding righteousness by eliminating his own relative. This is the inevitable result of the revolutionaries' firm stance, and it is the best kind of ruthlessness. Once sentimentality and ruthlessness are analyzed, the right and wrong become immediately apparent.
    Ruthlessness is the same, but the essence is different, even opposite. Twenty-five years ago, the Soviet young hero and Young Pioneer Morozov angrily reported his father, a traitor, and testified in court, thus incurring the hatred of the rich peasants, and his childhood life was taken away. The young hero's ruthlessness embodied the noble qualities of Soviet people and Young Pioneers; the rich peasants' attack on the young hero was the counterattack of a dying class against the revolution. These two kinds of ruthlessness, one is respectable, the other is despicable.
    Today, who do the people have feelings for and who are they ruthless towards? The article "Me and Huangsha" in the 18th issue of "New Observer" provides a realistic and wonderful answer to this question: Today, if someone is a rightist, his "relatives" and the old and young in his village will not recognize him.
    Who do the rightists have feelings for and who are they ruthless towards? The accusations of the late Communist Party member Zhang Botao's (Zhang Bojun's younger brother) wife against Zhang Bojun and Li Jiansheng are also a very realistic answer. This couple—a rightist boss and a rightist female general—are so mean and ruthless towards their widowed sister-in-law and nephews who have become orphans that they are practically mistreating them.
    It can be seen that the people's use of sentimentality is clear about right and wrong and has political choices; the rightists' use of sentimentality is not indiscriminate and also has political choices. Except for making mistakes, no one inherently uses sentimentality without being guided by politics.
    It can be seen that the big and small rightists unanimously clamor that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a mess," and some even shield counter-revolutionaries. Their sentimentality towards counter-revolutionaries is no accident. The issue of emotion is essentially an issue of class standpoint.
    Our Party has always treated anyone based on the people's interests and political standards, with a clear distinction between good and bad; whether sentimental or ruthless, it is always selfless and impartial. This time, treating the rightists inside and outside the Party "equally" has made us realize this more deeply.
    What is beneficial to the people is right whether sentimental or ruthless; what is harmful to the people is wrong whether sentimental or ruthless. The boundary between right and wrong in sentimentality and ruthlessness can only be this way.
    Nadezhda Krupskaya, Lenin's wife, said when recalling Lenin's second exile abroad: "He still broke off relations with his closest friends as before, if he found that they were dragging the revolutionary movement backward; he was good at treating yesterday's enemies simply and in a comradely manner, if the revolutionary cause needed to do so" (Preface to Lenin's Memoirs, page 3). Let us learn from the revolutionary teachers and the people's masses and adopt a way of life that uses sentimentality based on political choices!

    无情和有情
    傅兢
    大大小小的右派分子几乎异口同声地咒骂新社会“人和人没有真感情”“共产党冷酷无情，六亲不认”。有一些人认识模糊，是非不分，也跟着叫喊。可见感情问题是关系大是大非的问题，而不只是什么儿女私情和朋友交情。
    有情是是，无情是非吗？不一定。倒过来，有情是非，无情是是吗？也不一定。这里面的是非要根据具体的人和事做具体的评定，更要看评定者的立场。
    有事实根据的电影“扑不灭的火焰”里的汉奸蒋二，蹂躏自己家乡，迫害自己母亲，并决意把自己弟弟致于死命。殃民以逞，残酷无情，这是汉奸卖国贼的特性。抗日英雄蒋三，起初是想尽方法争取蒋二改邪归正，参加抗日，这种用心和努力表现了革命者待人仁至义尽，非常有情，也是对的。后来蒋三亲手击毙蒋二，又表现了他对败类绝然无情，大义灭亲，这是革命者立场坚定的必然结果，是最好的一种无情。有情与无情，一经分析，是非立见。
    同是无情，本质不同，甚至相反。二十五年前苏联小英雄少先队员莫洛佐夫曾愤怒地检举了他的父亲——叛徒，并出席法庭作证，因而遭到富农忌恨，以至被夺去了他的童年生命。小英雄无情，体现了苏维埃人和少先队员的崇高品质；富农对小英雄下毒手，是灭亡的阶级对革命的反噬。这两种无情，一个可敬，一个可卑。
    今天，人民群众对谁有情对谁无情呢？“新观察”十八期“我和黄沙”一文，真是现实而绝妙地答复了这个问题，今天谁要是右派分子，他的“六亲”和乡里老幼都是不认他的。
    右派分子对谁有情对谁无情呢？已故共产党员章伯韬（章伯钧之弟）夫人对章伯钧、李健生的控诉也是一个很现实的回答，这对夫妇——右派头子和右派女将对已经成为寡妇孤儿的弟媳和侄儿们是那样的刻薄无情，简直形同虐待。
    可见人民群众用情，是是非分明，有政治选择的；右派分子用情，也不是彼此不分，没有政治选择的。除了犯错误，本来就没有离开政治而用情的人。
    可见大小右派分子一致叫嚣“肃反一团糟”，有的还包庇反革命，他们对反革命那样有情，不是偶然的了。感情问题实质上就是阶级立场问题。
    我们党对待任何人，历来是根据人民利害和政治标准，好恶分明；不论有情与无情，都是大公无私的。这次“一视同仁”地对待党内外右派分子，使我们更深刻体会了这一点。
    有利于人民者，有情对，无情也对；有害于人民者，有情错，无情也错。有情与无情的是非界限，只能如此。
    列宁夫人克鲁普斯卡娅在回忆列宁第二次侨居国外的情景时说：“他仍像以前那样与他的最亲近的朋友绝交，如果他发现他们把革命运动拖向后退的话；他善于质朴地、以同志的态度对待昨天的敌人，如果革命事业需要这样做的话”（列宁回忆录序三页）。让我们向革命导师和人民群众学习依据政治选择而用情的生活态度吧！
