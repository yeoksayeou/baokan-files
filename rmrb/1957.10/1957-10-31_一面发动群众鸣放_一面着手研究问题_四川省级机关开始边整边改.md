Xinhua News Agency report: Sichuan Provincial organs have comprehensively entered the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement in the Rectification Campaign. Currently, all provincial organs have formulated rectification plans and are simultaneously mobilizing the masses to thoroughly expose problems. They are also comprehensively organizing the opinions raised by the masses, identifying the main problems existing within their respective units, and preparing to organize mass debates to propose improvement measures.

Prior to entering the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement, many organs made relatively thorough preparations. The finance and trade system successively dispatched over 300 cadres to form 80 work groups, which delved into grassroots units to investigate and understand the situation, solicit opinions, and assist in solving current work-related problems, thus closely integrating the rectification of work style and improvement of work with current business operations. During the rectification campaign launched in secondary schools across the province in late September, the Education Department sent personnel to prefectures and counties to collect opinions and investigate major problems. In early October, some leaders of the political and legal system also led work groups to Mianyang, Wanxian, Daxian, and other places to inspect the right-leaning thoughts in relevant political and legal work.

Since the beginning of October, a surge of free airing of views has emerged in a few units. Under the leadership of party members, the masses of the Water Conservancy Department posted more than 50 editions of big-character posters in less than half a month, putting forward 490 opinions and suggestions. More than 90 cadres of the Provincial Anti-epidemic Station have put forward more than 500 opinions, equivalent to about twice the number of opinions raised in the previous stage of airing views. After the start of the airing of views, 21 cadres and a Communist Youth League branch of the Industry Department posted big-character posters, requesting to go to the countryside and work at the grassroots level. Some organs also launched extensive debates while airing views. The masses of the Transportation Department have launched extensive debates on issues such as wages, housing, unified purchase and sale, organizational structure, and united front work. The Agriculture Department and the Industry Department have also made arrangements for issues that need to be debated based on the situation of their respective units. The Agriculture Department will debate issues such as hierarchical management, comprehensive arrangements for agricultural production, and strengthening technical guidance. The Industry Department will debate issues such as giving priority to the development of heavy industry while simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, building the country through diligence and thrift, and combining large, medium, and small enterprises.

    一面发动群众鸣放　一面着手研究问题
    四川省级机关开始边整边改
    新华社讯　四川省级机关的整风运动已开始全面转入着重整改阶段。现在，所有省级机关都已制订了整改计划，正在一面放手发动群众深入揭发问题；一面综合整理群众提出的意见，找出本单位存在的主要问题，准备组织群众展开辩论，提出改进办法。
    在转入着重整改阶段以前，许多机关都作了比较充分的准备工作。财政贸易系统先后抽调了三百多名干部组成八十个工作组，深入基层单位调查了解情况，征求意见，并协助下面解决当前工作中的问题，这样就使整顿作风和改进工作和当前业务工作紧密结合起来。教育厅在9月下旬全省中等学校开展整风期间，就派人到专区和市县收集意见，对主要问题进行了摸底。10月上旬，政法系统的一些负责人也率领工作组分别到绵阳、万县、达县等地，检查有关政法工作中的右倾思想等情况。
    从10月初以来，少数单位已开始出现大鸣大放的热潮。水利厅的广大群众在党员的带动下，不到半个月就贴出五十多版大字报，提出意见和建议四百九十条。省防疫站九十多个干部已提出五百多条意见，相当于前一阶段鸣放中所提意见的一倍左右。工业厅在鸣放开始后，有二十一个干部和一个共青团支部贴出大字报，要求下农村和到基层工作。有些机关在鸣放的同时还展开了大辩论。交通厅的广大群众已围绕着工资、房子、统购统销、组织机构、统战工作等问题展开了大辩论。农业厅、工业厅也根据本单位情况对需要辩论的问题作了安排，农业厅将辩论分级管理、农业生产的全面安排和加强技术指导等问题；工业厅将辩论在优先发展重工业的基础上工农业并举、勤俭建国、大中小企业相结合等问题。
