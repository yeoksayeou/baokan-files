　　The Young Man and the Fly
　　焦维
    A young and strong lad was hurrying on his way. A thorn by the roadside had scratched his left ankle a little.

    A gray fly, relying on its unique sense of smell, flew over quickly, chasing the wound and buzzing, "Oh dear! Stop, stop, you are bleeding all over, your whole body is festering, your whole body is rotting, let me help you..."

    The traveler heard the fly's voice and saw this dirty fellow who lived off pus and blood, trying to inject germs into this small wound to make the whole body fester. So, with a "slap," he knocked the fly to the ground.

    The young man continued on his way. The one who was truly rotting all over was that gray fly.

　　小伙子和苍蝇
　　焦维
    年轻力壮的小伙子正在急忙赶路。道旁的荆棘把他的左脚踝划破了一点点。
    一头灰色的苍蝇，靠着它那独有的嗅觉，飞奔过来，追着伤痕营营地叫：“不得了啦！快停下来，快停下来，你全身都流血了，全身都汇脓了，全身都腐烂了，我来帮助你……”
    行路人听到了苍蝇的声音，就看清了这个依靠脓血过活的脏家伙，想在这点小小的伤痕上放进毒菌，使整个肉体溃烂。于是“拍”的一声，把苍蝇打落在地上了。
    小伙子依然走自己的路。真正全身腐烂的，是那头灰色的苍蝇。
