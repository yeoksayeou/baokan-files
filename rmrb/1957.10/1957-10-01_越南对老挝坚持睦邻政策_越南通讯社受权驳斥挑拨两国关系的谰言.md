Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 30th. The Vietnam News Agency was authorized on September 28th to publish a statement regarding groundless assertions aimed at sowing discord between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos.

The statement said that on September 23rd, Agence France-Presse (AFP) London news quoted an article in the London "Times" on the Laotian situation, which stated that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had interfered in the internal affairs of Laos.

The next day, AFP in Paris reported a statement made to its reporter by the Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Phouang Sananikone, who was traveling to New York to attend the United Nations meeting. The report said: "According to the Laotian Foreign Minister, the interference of the Viet Minh and China in Laos is obvious. The minister estimates that one-tenth of the Laotian armed forces are originally from Viet Minh or China."

The statement pointed out that these words are groundless and deliberately distort the facts. The statement said that since the restoration of peace in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently strived to establish good-neighborly relations with the government of the Kingdom of Laos, in the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in internal affairs.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has correctly implemented the Geneva Agreements on the cessation of hostilities and has withdrawn all its volunteer forces from Laotian territory since 1954. Since then, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always regarded the issue of the Lao forces participating in Laotian national life as Laos' internal affair.

Recently, the neighborly relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos have further developed to the benefit of both sides. However, external reactionary forces do not want this situation to develop in this way. They have been looking for all means to sow discord and undermine the good-neighborly relations between the Kingdom of Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is these people who shamelessly interfere in the internal affairs of Laos and create obstacles to obstruct the consultations between the government of the Kingdom of Laos and the Lao forces in order to resolve the issue of the restoration of Laos' unification on the basis of peace and democracy.

The statement concluded that these conspiracies will certainly fail and cannot hinder the existing good-neighborly relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos.

### 越南对老挝坚持睦邻政策  越南通讯社受权驳斥挑拨两国关系的谰言

    越南对老挝坚持睦邻政策
    越南通讯社受权驳斥挑拨两国关系的谰言
    新华社河内30日电  越南通讯社在9月28日受权发表了有关旨在越南民主共和国和老挝王国之间播弄不和的、毫无根据的说法的声明。
    声明说，9月23日法新社伦敦消息援引了伦敦“泰晤士报”上一篇关于老挝局势的文章，其中说什么越南民主共和国干涉了老挝内政。
    第二天，在巴黎法新社报道了前往纽约出席联合国会议的老挝王国外交大臣冯·萨纳尼空对这家通讯社记者发表的谈话。这个报道说：“据老挝外交大臣说，越盟和中国对寮国的干涉是显而易见的。这位大臣估计，寮国武装部队中有十分之一的人员是原籍越盟或中国的人员。”
    声明指出，这些话是毫无根据的，是故意歪曲事实真象。声明说，自从在越南、柬埔寨和老挝恢复和平以来，越南民主共和国政府本着和平共处的五项原则、尊重主权和领土的完整及互不干涉内政的精神，坚持不渝地努力争取同老挝王国政府建立睦邻关系。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府正确地执行了关于停止敌对行动的日内瓦协定，并且自从1954年以后就从老挝领土上撤出了它的全部志愿部队。自从那时候以来，越南民主共和国政府一直认为寮国部队参加老挝国民生活问题是老挝的内政。
    最近，越南民主共和国同老挝王国的邻邦关系，已经有了有利于双方的进一步发展。但是，外界的反动力量却不希望情况这样发展。他们一直在寻找一切办法来播弄不和和破坏老挝王国同越南民主共和国之间的睦邻关系。正是这些人无耻地干预老挝的内政、制造障碍来阻挠老挝王国政府和寮国部队为了在和平和民主基础上解决老挝恢复统一问题而进行的协商。
    声明最后说，这些阴谋肯定会遭到失败，也不可能妨碍越南民主共和国同老挝王国之间现有的睦邻关系。
