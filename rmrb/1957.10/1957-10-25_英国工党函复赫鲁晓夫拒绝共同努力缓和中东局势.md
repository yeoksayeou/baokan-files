Xinhua News Agency, London, October 23rd. The British Labour Party Executive Committee today wrote to Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, rejecting the appeal from the CPSU Central Committee to jointly work to ease tensions in the Middle East. The Labour Party gave as its reason that it is "in the position of the opposition party" and therefore, "cannot directly hold negotiations with governments of other countries"; at the same time, the Labour Party is "not prepared to take joint action with any Communist Party."

An editorial in the British "Daily Worker" stated that this rejection is "a disgrace to the British Labour Party." The editorial said that the Labour Party's "constitutional" argument that the opposition party cannot negotiate with the governments of other countries has not prevented the Labour Party from holding discussions with social democratic parties in various European countries, even though some of these social democratic parties are participating in their own national governments. The "Daily Worker" called on the rank-and-file members of the Labour Party to "make the (Labour Party) Executive Committee loyal to the cause of peace, and not loyal to Macmillan's foreign policy."

    英国工党函复赫鲁晓夫拒绝共同努力缓和中东局势
    据新华社伦敦23日电　英国工党执行委员会今天写信给苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫，拒绝了苏共中央向英国工党所提出的要求共同努力来缓和中东紧张局势的呼吁，理由是英国工党“处在反对党的地位”，因此，“不能直接同其他国家的政府举行谈判”；同时，英国工党也“不准备同任何共产党采取联合行动”。
    英国“工人日报”的社论说，这种拒绝是“英国工党的羞耻”。社论说，工党所谓反对党不能同其他国家的政府进行谈判的这种“宪法上”的论点，并没有妨碍工党同欧洲各国的社会党进行讨论，尽管其中有一些社会党是参加它们本国的政府的。“工人日报”号召工党的下层党员“让（工党）执行委员会忠于和平事业，而不要忠于麦克米伦的外交政策。”
