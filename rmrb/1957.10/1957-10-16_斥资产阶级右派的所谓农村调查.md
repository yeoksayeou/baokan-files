　　Refuting the So-Called Rural Surveys of the Bourgeois Rightists
　　He Zhiping
　　A group of sociologists, bourgeois rightists, seem to verbally acknowledge the reactionary nature of the bourgeois sociological stance and viewpoints, but they are vigorously promoting the investigation and research methods of old sociology. They first slander Marxist-Leninists, saying, "In the past, some people who studied Marxism-Leninism dogmatically applied formulas and could not solve practical problems." Wu Jingchao even arrogantly slandered the State Statistical Bureau, saying it only knew how to learn from the Soviet Union's reporting system and did not adopt various methods suitable for China's situation. He blamed the State Statistical Bureau for rarely consulting them, these "experienced experts," on statistical investigation work during the planning and preparation stages. At the same time, they used all the propaganda skills of sociology to boast that they were very good at social surveys, that they were "experts" in rural surveys, and even said, "Now that we have learned the theories of Marxism-Leninism, we can conduct investigations very well," and "We have all become materialists." Look, becoming a materialist is so easy, just declare it verbally. In this way, they have both the investigation and research experience of old sociology and the stance and viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism. Those who are scolded as "dogmatists" should naturally step down and let the right-wing sociology gentlemen investigate, research, participate in national decision-making, and solve various policy problems in our country. So, Fei Xiaotong patted his chest and came out to recommend talents for us. He said: "Are there people who know how to conduct social surveys? I think there are. If we want to do this work, I am willing to recommend this group of people." In the self-intoxicated bragging of these "sociologists," it seems that Marxist-Leninists simply do not exist, and now it is time for this group of self-proclaimed investigation experts to act recklessly.
　　Here, it is necessary to remind the right-wing sociology gentlemen, please calm down a bit. Aren't you very good at investigation and research? Why don't you even do a basic investigation before making these self-promoting advertisements? If you do a little investigation, you will know that the investigation and research work done by Communists and many non-Party workers is much better than your pitiful stuff.
　　Under the guidance of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we Communists have always attached importance to investigation and research work. Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" are examples of analyzing the social situation at that time using the viewpoint of Marxism. His Xingguo Survey, Changgang Township Survey, and Caixi Township Survey have set brilliant examples for rural surveys. Our Party Central Committee specially made a "Decision on Investigation and Research" in 1942, calling on the whole Party to conduct investigation and research. Never in Chinese history has investigation and research been valued so much. When implementing various policies, the Party organizations at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party conduct considerable investigation and research based on the instructions of the Central Committee. The "Land Reform Law," the "Labor Law," the CCP Central Committee's "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," as well as the "Model Regulations for Agricultural Cooperatives" and the "Marriage Law," were all formulated on the basis of full investigation and research and key experiments. Just in terms of rural surveys, the investigation and research work we have done is by no means comparable to any bourgeois sociology in terms of quality and quantity. The rightists think that the marriage issue was blank, but it was investigated as early as 1952. Our investigation ranged from cities to villages, and was widespread to remote areas. All existing marriage forms were investigated. The Marriage Law formulated on the basis of this investigation solved the feudal marriage system that existed in history and guaranteed the freedom of marriage for young men and women. May I ask, right-wing gentlemen, have you conducted such a large-scale investigation? What problems did your investigation solve? Chen Da said, "Rural work has also been put on the agenda... It is also necessary to get to the bottom of it and conduct a systematic investigation and research," as if rural work had never been put on the agenda before, as if the world simply exists for the right-wing gentlemen. What you announce doesn't exist simply doesn't exist. The fact is, of course, not the case. Marxist-Leninists have never interrupted investigation and research work in rural work. In the land reform and cooperative movement, our party, from the central to the county and district levels, each level of party organization had its own typical experimental villages, and all had investigation and research, and the materials are vast. The 176 materials selected in the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" published last year are only a small part of the 1955 investigation materials. May I ask the right-wing "sociology" gentlemen, are these investigations on rural work? Can you come up with something comparable on this issue, even if it was done in ten years? If you can't come up with something comparable, then what basis do you have to say that only you sociologists attach importance to investigation and research? What basis do you have to say that Fei Xiaotong should recommend a group of people to do investigation work, while not mentioning the thousands of people actually engaged in various investigation work? The right-wing gentlemen should know that these personnel engaged in actual investigation work, although they do not have the title of scholars, have better training and technology than the old sociologists. They do investigation work not to write books and sell them for money, nor to sell the materials to imperialism in exchange for the title of "doctor," but to solve problems urgently related to the interests of the broad masses of working people. The solution of the problem is the best reward for their labor. May I ask, what basis do the right-wing sociologists have to say that Marxist-Leninists can only dogmatically move formulas and cannot solve practical problems? Historical facts have proved that it is the bourgeois sociologists who cannot solve practical problems. Right-wing gentlemen, you are very interested in women's issues, family issues, children's issues, welfare issues, etc., and you have conducted at least two or thirty years of investigation and research before liberation, but what else are you interested in besides writing books and selling them for money, being accomplices of the bourgeoisie, and flattering imperialism, in order to solve your own fame and fortune problems? What problems have you solved for workers, peasants, women, and children? In just about ten years since liberation, these problems have been basically solved or the conditions for solving them have been prepared through the investigation and research of party and government organs, mass organizations, and factory and enterprise workers. And the right-wing sociological "scholars" not only do not feel ashamed in the face of these facts, but instead shamelessly stand aside and point fingers, nitpick, and want to take the opportunity of the Communist Party's rectification to knock a few bamboos. They simply do not know what shame is in the world!
　　The right-wing sociology gentlemen complain that we do not accept the heritage or "rational part" of bourgeois sociology to enrich Marxism-Leninism. Regarding this point, Chairman Mao has long said: "Generally speaking, China's immature bourgeoisie has not had time and will never be able to prepare for us more complete or even minimal materials on social conditions, as the bourgeoisie in Europe, America, and Japan has." The right-wing sociology gentlemen may disagree with this conclusion. But what facts can you produce to overthrow this conclusion? Fei Xiaotong proposed that those who have taught and studied sociology in universities before, "They have done this set of investigation work in the past, and their stance, viewpoints, and methods are certainly incorrect, but these can be transformed through study. The techniques of interviewing, observing, recording, and analyzing that they originally learned are still useful." And he said that these things, like language, have no class nature and should be accepted, but Marxist-Leninists have not accepted them. Are these so-called social investigation methods really without class nature? Of course not. We believe that methods cannot be completely separated from stance and viewpoints. Without a correct stance and viewpoint, there will be no correct method. These methods of the right-wing sociology gentlemen are copied from the European and American bourgeoisie. Those that can truly be said to be scientific methods have been critically absorbed and used by Marx and Engels, and are included in materialist dialectics. As for your sociological investigation methods, we believe that this is a set of investigation methods of the landlord and bourgeois classes. The methods of interviewing, observing, and recording mentioned by Fei Xiaotong have great class nature. Before liberation, bourgeois sociologists conducted investigations through the police organs and township chiefs at that time. What they obtained from them were only the lies of the landlords distorting the facts. When they conducted investigations and interviews with peasants, they wore suits and leather shoes, lived in the homes of landlords, and asked the peasants to come to them for questioning, and the peasants regarded them as the masters of the government. People familiar with the rural situation know that in the minds of the peasants, there is not much difference between the masters and the bandits. What truth dare the peasants tell these masters besides complimenting the landlords' kindness? Regarding this point, Fei Xiaotong's Jiangcun investigation is a good example. First of all, Fei Xiaotong's investigation materials were collected while living in the home of the township chief Zhou Baoshan and with his help. In Chapter 11, "The Land System," of this book, he describes landlords, tenants, and hired laborers as three kinds of people whose rights, obligations, and rewards are completely equal. The landlord has the ownership of the land, and the rent is the reward he deserves, and he has the obligation to pay taxes; the tenant has the right to use the land, and his reward is the harvested products, and he has the obligation to pay rent. Not only that, but the landlord also has "traditional humanitarian concepts" and "humanitarian principles." These gentlemen, when "visiting" peasants, "are sometimes reluctant to extort tenants." Thus, "sometimes these gentlemen take back only moral satisfaction." Also, without the generosity of usurers, peasants would have no access to borrowing when they need money. Therefore, Fei Xiaotong believes that it is wrong to call landlords and usurers bad people. As for the rent-collecting bureau, which guarantees the landlords' cruel exploitation and oppression of the peasants, it is also very gentle in Fei Xiaotong's writing, "If the tenant refuses to pay the rent, the bureau has the right to arrest him and send him to the county government to sit in prison. However, if the tenant really cannot pay the rent, he will be released at the end of the year." Look, under Fei Xiaotong's classless analysis and observation, rent collection is the reward that the landlord deserves, and rent payment is the obligation that the peasant should fulfill. The countryside is just a harmonious whole, and there are no classes and exploitation. This is completely the nonsense of the landlord, and it is not worth refuting. But Fei Xiaotong announced to us that this is the result of his social investigation and classless analysis and observation methods. We need to expose this kind of deception. It just so happens that I have a "Rural Survey of Jiangsu Province" on hand, which includes a survey of the land system in 23 counties in southern Jiangsu (including Wujiang County, where Kai Xian Gong Village is located). If we compare these two investigations, we can understand how strong the class nature of social investigation itself is.
　　"In short, the landlord class and the reactionary government colluded to harm the peasants. Some landlords, in order to deceive the peasants and achieve rapid rent collection, stipulated 'advance discounts, late fines.' For example, the Jiading landlord stipulated '70% off in July,' '80% off in August,' and '90% off in September.' As 'Rent Assessment'载：‘……The rice and wheat will only be harvested in October, but the rent deadline has already started in mid-September, and when it is threshed and sold, the rent deadline has long been reached, with no discount at all’! In fact, not only is there 'no discount at all,' but there are only fines. Qingpu, Taicang and other counties stipulate 'three deadlines': 'first deadline' ten days to half a month, overdue add 10% to the original rent (also add ten pounds); 'second deadline' seven to ten days, overdue add another 10% to the original rent (or add ten pounds); 'third deadline' five to seven days, overdue add another 10% (or add thirty pounds in total). Landlord Wang Qiusheng of Guangfu District, Wuxian County, used the cruel torture of 'three comparisons' to deal with peasants who owed rent. 'Three comparisons' means 'small comparison' every three days, 'big comparison' every five days, and 'blood comparison' every seven days. The method of 'comparison' is to put the peasant who owes rent on a specially made wooden frame, turn his buttocks over, and whip him hard until he bleeds, which is called 'blood comparison'. In the prison of landlord Hua Jinzhi of Qiaotou Town, Jurong County, more than 400 peasants were imprisoned in five years, and some were killed in the prison. Landlord Zheng Mingde of Banqiao Township, Lishui, also built a fortress to imprison peasants. When landlord Xue Nian'entang of Meicun District, Wuxi, forced rent, he used cruel torture tools such as 'rolling bamboo baskets', 'eating bamboo chopsticks', and 'sitting on cold square bricks' to deal with peasants who owed rent. Landlords in Kunshan and Changshu counties used 24 methods of forcing rent on peasants who owed rent, such as parading in the streets, locking the courtyard pillars, cutting the fields, standing cages, hostages, wearing shackles, rolling bamboo baskets, torture, opening ferry boats, and releasing water lanterns. Many landlords have凶器 such as handcuffs, fetters, iron hammers, and clubs, and they detain and beat the peasants at every turn, forcing countless peasants to be破人亡 and forcing countless kind peasants to death."
　　The same countryside, our investigation and Fei Xiaotong's so-called investigation are so different. May I ask, is Fei Xiaotong's method of social investigation really without class nature?
　　As for our social investigation today, it is closely linked to the masses through the party organization. The party has a high prestige among the masses, and the investigation is entirely based on the interests of the masses. Naturally, it has won the trust of the peasants, so the peasants dare to tell the truth, and the authenticity of the materials is trustworthy. Therefore, compared with the bourgeois sociological investigation, the Communist Party's investigation is more scientific and accurate.
　　What we have said above are still examples from before liberation. After liberation, it is said that they have been transformed and "have all become materialists." Now let's take a look at the investigation conducted by the right-wing gentlemen in this unusual spring this year.
　　The right-wing sociology gentlemen everywhere tout Li Jinghan's "The Past and Present of Family Production in Rural Areas of Beijing Suburbs." Chen Da said, "Professor Li Jinghan used the most typical sociological methods in this investigation." If Li Jinghan's investigation reflects some changes in the lives of peasants before and after liberation, it is because he felt that his old reputation was too bad and wanted to do something to win the trust of the people, so he reflected a little of the actual situation of rural changes. But as a rural social investigation, it is far from enough. From the Marxist-Leninist point of view, the purpose of conducting social investigation is to discover the internal connections of social things and find out the laws of the development of things through the investigation and analysis of specific situations, so as to overcome difficulties and improve work. Simply put, it is to discover problems and solve problems. However, Li Jinghan's report only reflects the contrast between the past and the present of the family life of a family of five, and lists many phenomena, without even missing flies and mosquitoes, but it does not reflect the internal connections of things at all. This family of five is examined as an isolated phenomenon, and we cannot see where the inherent inevitability of its wealthy life lies. The article also mentions some problems existing in the countryside, but it does not know how these problems arise, and naturally it is impossible to find any solutions to the problems from this article. It only serves the function of a camera. And because the author's stance and viewpoint have not changed, a poisonous thorn grows in the end, saying that "people all know that it was wrong to treat people as cattle and horses in the past, but today they sometimes use people as tractors." In one sentence, the whole situation is negated, making people feel that the improvement of life becomes meaningless. Can such a rural survey be said to scientifically reflect the situation in the countryside?
　　As for Fei Xiaotong's "Revisiting Jiangcun," it cannot be regarded as a work of investigation and research. Because Comrade Zhou Shulian and others have exposed and criticized his so-called investigation, I will not make a detailed analysis here.
　　Based on the above situation, the bourgeois rightists' enthusiasm for social investigation is by no means engaged in scientific research, but has ulterior motives. They want to use the name of investigation to collect state secrets and social conditions as information for attacking the Party and the government, and to carry out the conspiracy of providing information about China's socialist construction to imperialist countries. We must resolutely oppose the conspiracy of the restoration of old sociology, defend Marxism-Leninism, and defend the cause of socialist construction.

　　斥资产阶级右派的所谓农村调查
　　贺致平
    资产阶级右派的一群社会学者对资产阶级社会学的立场、观点的反动性在口头似乎承认了，但对旧社会学的调查研究方法却大吹大擂。他们首先诬蔑马列主义者，说“过去有一些研究马克思列宁主义的人，教条主义地搬用公式，并不能解决实际问题”。吴景超更狂妄地诬蔑国家统计局只会学习苏联的报表制度，没有采用适合我国情况的各种方法，责备国家统计局对统计调查工作在计划和准备时期很少找他们这些“经验丰富的专家”请教。同时，却用社会学的全部宣传本领吹嘘他们是很会做社会调查的，他们是农村调查的“专家”，甚至说“现在我们学习了马克思列宁主义的理论，可以很好地进行调查了”，“我们已经都成为唯物主义者”了。请看，作一个唯物主义者，竟是这样容易，只要口头宣布一下就可以了。这样一来，他们既有旧社会学的调查研究经验，又有马列主义的立场观点，被他们骂作“教条主义者”的人们自然应该下台，让右派社会学先生们来调查研究，参予国家决策，解决我国各项政策问题了。于是费孝通拍着胸膛出来为我们保举人材。他说：“有没有会搞社会调查的人呢？我认为是有的。如果要搞这些工作，我愿意保举这一批人员。”在这些“社会学者”们自我陶醉的吹牛声中，马列主义者们好像竟然不存在了，现在是该由这群自命为调查专家的右派分子们来胡作非为的时候了。
    在这里，有必要提醒右派社会学先生们，请你们冷静一些，你们不是很会调查研究吗？为什么你们在做这些自我吹嘘的广告之前连起码的调查也不做呢？如果你们稍许作一些调查，你们将会知道共产党人和党外的许多工作人员所作的调查研究工作比你们那些可怜的货色要高明得多。
    我们共产党人在党中央和毛主席的教导下，一向是重视调查研究工作的。毛主席的中国社会各阶级的分析、湖南农民运动考察报告就是运用马克思主义的观点分析当时社会情况的榜样。他的兴国调查、长冈乡调查、才溪乡调查，给我们树立了农村调查的光辉范例。我们党的中央在1942年专门作了“关于调查研究的决定”，号召全党进行调查研究。在中国历史上从来没有这样重视过调查研究。中国共产党的各级组织在执行各项政策时都是根据中央的指示进行相当的调查研究的。“土地改革法”，“劳动法”，中共中央“关于农业合作化问题的决议”，以及“农业合作社示范章程”和“婚姻法”等，都是在充分的调查研究和重点实验的基础上制订的。仅就农村调查一项，我们所做的调查研究工作不论从质量和数量方面说决非任何资产阶级社会学所可比拟的。右派认为空白的婚姻问题早在1952年就进行过调查，我们的调查从都市到乡村，普遍到穷乡僻壤，对一切现存的婚姻形态都有调查。在这个调查基础上制定的婚姻法，解决了历史上存在的封建婚姻制度，保障了青年男女的婚姻自由。试问，右派先生们，你们曾进行过这样大规模的调查吗？你们的调查解决了什么问题？陈达说：“农村工作也提到日程上来了……也需要来摸摸底，作一番系统的调查研究”，好像在这以前，农村工作从来还没有提到日程上来，好像世界简直是为右派先生们而存在的，你们宣布没有的东西就不会存在。事实当然不是这样，马列主义者在农村工作中从来就没有间断过调查研究工作。在土地改革和合作化运动中我们党从中央到县区，各级党的组织都有自己的典型试验的乡村，都有调查研究，材料是浩如烟海。去年出版的“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书所选一百七十六篇材料，还仅仅是1955年调查材料中很小的一部分。请问右派“社会学”先生们，这些是不是关于农村工作的调查，你们在这个问题上能不能拿出相当的东西来比较一下，即使十年的时间内所做的也好。假若你们拿不出相当的货色，那么，你们有什么根据说只有你们社会学者是重视调查研究的？有什么根据说搞调查工作要由费孝通来保举一批人，而对成千上万的实际从事各项调查工作的人员一字不提？右派先生们应该知道，这些从事实际调查的工作人员，虽然没有学者的头衔，但却比旧社会学者们具有更加优良的训练和技术。他们做调查工作不是为了写书卖钱，也不是为了把材料出卖给帝国主义换什么“博士”的头衔，而是为了解决与广大劳动人民的利益迫切有关的问题。问题解决了就是对他们的劳作的最好的报酬。请问，右派社会学者们有什么根据说马列主义者只会教条主义地搬运公式不能解决实际问题？历史的事实证明，不能解决实际问题的是资产阶级的社会学者。右派先生们，你们对妇女问题，家庭问题，儿童问题，福利问题等很有兴趣，在解放前就已进行过至少二、三十年的调查研究，但你们除了写书卖钱，为资产阶级帮凶，向帝国主义献媚，以解决自己的名利问题外，你们还有什么兴趣呢？你们为工人、农民、妇女、儿童解决了什么问题？解放后仅仅十年左右的时间内，这些问题经过党政机关、群众团体和工厂企业的工作人员的调查研究，已获得了基本解决，或者准备了解决的条件。而右派社会学的“学者”们面对这些事实不但不感到惭愧，反而厚起脸皮站在一旁指手划脚，吹毛求疵，想利用共产党整风的机会敲敲竹杠。简直不知人间有羞耻事！
    右派社会学先生们抱怨我们不接受资产阶级社会学的遗产或者“合理部分”来丰富马列主义。关于这一点，毛主席早已说过：“一般地说，中国幼稚的资产阶级还没有来得及也永远不可能替我们预备关于社会情况的较完备的甚至起码的材料，如同欧美日本的资产阶级那样。”右派社会学先生们可能不同意这个论断。但你们能够拿出什么事实来推翻这个论断呢？费孝通提出以前在大学里教过和学过社会学的人，“他们过去搞过这套调查工作，立场、观点、方法固然有不正确的地方，但是这些是可以通过学习来改造的。他们原来学会的那些访问、观察、记录、统计、分析等技术还是有用的。”并且说这些东西就像语言一样是没有阶级性，是应该接受而马列主义者还没有接受的。这些所谓社会调查的方法，真的没有阶级性的吗？当然不是。我们认为：方法和立场观点是不能绝然分开的，没有正确的立场和观点也不会有正确的方法。右派社会学先生们的这些方法是从欧美资产阶级那里抄来的，其中真正可以说是科学方法的，已被马克思恩格斯批判地加以吸收和运用，包括在唯物辩证法里去了。至于你们的社会学的调查方法，我们认为这是一套地主资产阶级的调查方法，费孝通所说的访问、观察、记录等方法，就有很大的阶级性。资产阶级社会学者，在解放前作调查是通过当时的警察机关和乡保长之类，从他们那里得到的只是地主歪曲事实的谎话。他们在向农民进行调查访问时穿着西服革履，住在地主的家里把农民找来问话，而农民则把他们当作官府的老爷。熟悉农村情况的人都知道在农民的心目中老爷和强盗是没有太大的区别的，农民对这些老爷们除了恭维地主恩德之外还敢说什么真话呢？关于这一点，费孝通的江村调查就是很好的例证。首先，费孝通的调查材料，就是住在乡长周宝山的家里并在他的帮助下搜集的。他在这本书的第十一章“土地制度”中，把地主、佃户和雇工说成是权利义务和报酬是完全平等的三种人。地主有田底的所有权，佃租是他应得的报酬，负有赋税的义务；佃农有田面使用权，他的报酬是收获产品，负有缴租的义务。不仅如此，地主还有着“怀着传统的人道主义观念”，“人道主义的原则”。这些绅士在“拜访”农民时“他们有时很不愿意对于佃户加以勒索”。于是，“有时使这些绅士带回去的只是道义上的满足”。还有，高利贷者，如果没有他们的慷慨，农民需要用钱时就会取借无门。所以，费孝通认为把地主高利贷者叫作坏人是不对的。至于为保障地主剥削残酷压榨农民的催租局在费孝通的笔下也是很温和的，“如果，佃户不肯交纳田租，局差有权把他逮捕起来，送到县政府坐监狱去。不过，如果佃户实在无法缴租，到了年底便把他释放”。请看，在费孝通的没有阶级性的分析和观察之下，收租是地主应得的报酬，缴租是农民应尽的义务。农村中只是和谐的一体，那里有什么阶级和剥削存在。这是十足的地主老爷的胡说，本来不值一驳。但费孝通向我们宣布这是他的社会调查，没有阶级性的分析和观察方法研究的结果。对这种骗局我们有必要加以揭露。恰好我手头有一本“江苏省农村调查”，其中就有苏南二十三个县（包括开弦弓村所在的吴江县在内）的土地制度的调查。我们把这两种调查拿来作个对比，就可以明白社会调查本身是具有多么强的阶级性了。
    “总之，地主阶级与反动政府‘沆瀣一气’，残害农民。有些地主为了欺骗农民达到迅速收租起见，曾规定‘限前有让，限后加罚’。如嘉定地主规定‘七月七折’，‘八月八折’，‘九月九折’。正如‘租核’所载：‘……田禾至十月方登场，而租限已自九月中始，及其脱粟而粜，则租限早满，无毫发让矣’！实际非但‘无毫发让’，反而只有加罚。青浦太仓等县规定‘三限’：‘头限’十天至半月，过期按原租额加一成（亦有加十斤的）；‘二限’七天至十天，过期按原租额再加一成（或加十斤）；‘三限’五天至七天，过期再加一成（或再加十斤共三十斤）。吴县光福区地主汪秋生曾用“三比”酷刑对付欠租农民，‘三比’是三天一‘小比’，五天一“大比”，七天一‘血比’。‘比’的方法是把欠租的农民，按置在一种特制木架上，掀翻屁股，用鞭子猛打，一直到见血，才叫‘血比’。句容县桥头镇地主华锦之的牢房里，五年中关过四百多个农民，有些则被杀死在牢里。溧水板桥乡地主正明德并且造了堡垒来监禁农民。无锡梅村区地主薛念恩堂逼租时用‘滚笆斗’，‘吃毛竹筷’，‘坐冷方砖’等残酷刑具，对付欠租农民。昆山、常熟两县地主对欠租农民采用游街，锁庭柱，裁田，站笼，人质，戴枷，滚笆斗，拷打，开差船，放水灯等二十四种逼租方法。不少地主备有手铐、脚镣、铁锤、棍棒等凶器，动辄扣押吊打农民，逼得无数的农民家破人亡，逼死了无数的善良农民。”
    同样的农村，我们的调查与费孝通的所谓调查竟然如此不同。请问费孝通社会调查的方法真的没有阶级性吗？
    至于我们今天的社会调查是通过党的组织和群众密切联系，党在群众中有崇高的威信，而调查又完全是从群众的利益出发，自然得到农民的信任，因而农民敢于讲真话，材料的真实性是值得信赖的。因此，共产党的调查和资产阶级社会学的调查相比有更大的科学性、准确性。
    以上我们所讲的还是解放以前的例子。解放以后据说他们已经过改造，“都已经成为唯物主义者了”。现在我们就拿右派先生们在今年这个不平常的春天所作的调查来看看。
    右派社会学先生们到处吹嘘李景汉的“北京郊区乡村家庭生产的今昔”。陈达说“李景汉教授在这次调查中所用的，正是最典型的社会学的方法。”李景汉的这个调查如果说他多少反映了解放前后农民生活的一些变化，那是因为他感到自己的旧名声太不好了，想做一点骗取人民的信任的事情，所以他多少反映了一点农村变化的实际情况。但如果作为农村的社会调查还差得很远。从马列主义的观点看来，进行社会调查的目的在于通过具体情况的调查和分析，发现社会事物的内部联系，找出事物发展的规律，以便克服困难改进工作。简单说来就是发现问题，解决问题。而李景汉的报告只不过反映了一个五口之家的家庭生活情况今昔不同的对比，罗列了许多现象，连苍蝇蚊子也没有漏掉，但却全然没有反映事物的内部联系。这五口之家当作孤立的现象被考察着，我们全然看不出它的富裕生活的内在的必然性在哪里。文中也提到农村中存在的一些问题，但却不知道这些问题是怎样产生的，自然也谈不到从这篇文章中找寻什么解决问题的办法。仅仅起了照像机的作用。并且由于作者的立场观点没有改变，最后还长出一根毒刺，说“人们都知道昔日把人当牛马是不对的，而今日却有时把人当拖拉机用一用”。一句话否定了全篇的情况，使人感到生活改善变得毫无意义。难道这样的农村调查可以说是科学地反映了农村的情况吗？
    至于费孝通的“重访江村”，是不能算得上什么调查研究的作品的。因周叔莲等同志已对他的这篇所谓调查作了揭露和批判，这里就不再作详细的分析了。
    根据上述情况，资产阶级右派热中于社会调查，决不是在搞什么科学研究，而是别有用心，想借调查之名搜集国家机密和社会情况，作为向党和政府进攻的资料，并向帝国主义国家供给有关我国社会主义建设情报的阴谋活动。我们必须坚决反对旧社会学复辟的阴谋，保卫马列主义，保卫社会主义建设事业。
