Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 10th: A massive rectification and socialist education movement has unfolded in industrial and mining enterprises in Liaoning Province. Since mid-September, over 300 units in nine industrial cities, including Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, and Andong, with nearly 700,000 workers, have successively joined the upsurge of "blooming and contending".

Before starting the rectification, each unit conducted thorough ideological mobilization, resulting in high enthusiasm among workers for "blooming and contending". At the Benxi No. 2 Coking Plant, over 80% of the workers wrote big-character posters or spoke at blooming and contending meetings during the first week. In Fushun, workers in eight factories and mines submitted over 30,000 suggestions in less than a week. At the Shenyang Huanggu Tun Locomotive, Passenger Car and Freight Car Repair Factory, 1,500 big-character posters were put up in two or three days. In many units, workers did not rest during lunch breaks or immediately go home after work. Still wearing their work clothes, they gathered in groups of three or five to write and read big-character posters.

The vast majority of opinions raised by the workers during the "blooming and contending" relate to improving production management, production technology, and the work style of cadres. Many workers used their brains to study problems and put forward significant suggestions beneficial to production. For example, Liu Jintang of the No. 2 Machining Workshop of the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory, proposed a reform plan to address the oversized workshop structure, which could reduce the number of management personnel from 66 to 33. Li Bingda, a veteran worker at the 53 Factory, raised many objections to the impractical operating procedures during the "blooming and contending", providing useful information for improving the procedures.

While mobilizing workers to "bloom and contend," each unit conscientiously implemented the principle of "rectifying while correcting." Problems that could be solved immediately were solved immediately. For problems that could not be solved immediately, improvement measures were formulated. The air ducts of the No. 1 pit of the Fuxin Xinqiu Mine were leaking, resulting in insufficient ventilation and frequent impact on production. After the workers put up big-character posters criticizing this, the problem has now been completely resolved. Rationalization proposals for warehouse management made by Chen Zhixin, a foreman at the Anshan No. 2 Mining Engineering Company, had been suppressed for more than a year. After he raised the issue again, the company manager immediately took action, which pleased the workers with the leadership's "rectifying while correcting" approach.

While "blooming and contending," workers in various factories and mines responded to the leadership's call to ensure that rectification and production are not neglected, and continued to report successes in production. Workers in more than 30 enterprises, including the Shenyang Paper Mill and Steel Rolling Mill, exceeded their third-quarter plans and increased production and thrift plans while "blooming and contending" in September.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 9th: The rectification movement in Tianjin's industrial enterprises, after more than 20 days of "blooming and contending," has now entered or is about to enter a new stage of rectifying ideological work style and improving work.

During this "blooming and contending," 300,000 workers in the city spoke freely through big-character posters, small group meetings, and forums, and put forward many criticisms and suggestions on the leadership work and leading cadres of the enterprises. According to statistics from more than 240 units alone, more than 600,000 big-character posters were posted from mid-September to early October, thoroughly exposing the shortcomings in various aspects of enterprise leadership work. The vast majority of opinions raised by the workers are correct or basically correct. However, a few opinions exposed the non-working-class ideological consciousness existing in the working class ranks. During the "blooming and contending," these opinions aroused dissatisfaction among the majority of workers, especially the old workers, and debates began.

The working class's enthusiasm for cherishing the Communist Party and the socialist cause has deeply educated the leading cadres of industrial enterprises. After eliminating concerns such as fear of "burning themselves" or "losing prestige" due to their shortcomings, they actively implemented the principle of "rectifying while correcting." Opinions that could be resolved immediately were resolved in a timely manner. According to statistics from more than 240 factories, more than 19,000 problems related to production management, welfare, and cadre work style have been solved so far. When the leadership sincerely accepted the workers' correct opinions and resolutely corrected their shortcomings, the workers respected them even more. On the big-character posters in many factories, there were clappers and rhymes praising the factory director and party secretary for resolutely improving their work. Workers from units such as the Tianjin Paper Mill and the Tianjin Railway Bureau Vehicle Section also took the initiative to help the leadership solve problems related to production technology and welfare.

　　辽宁近七十万职工投入鸣放热潮
    天津二百四十多个厂已解决问题近两万件
    新华社沈阳10日电　声势浩大的整风和社会主义教育运动已在辽宁省工矿企业中展开。从9月中旬起，沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、安东等九个工业城市，有三百多个单位、近七十万职工先后投入了大鸣大放的热潮。
    各单位在开始整风之前，由于进行了充分的思想动员，职工群众鸣放的积极性很高。本溪第二焦化厂工人在鸣放第一周内，就有80％以上的人写了大字报或在鸣放会上发了言。抚顺八个厂矿单位的职工不到一周，就提出了三万多条意见。沈阳皇姑屯机车客车和货车修理工厂，两三天内就贴出了一千五百多张大字报。许多单位的职工在午休时间不休息，下班后也不立刻回家，工作服还没脱下，就三个一堆、五个一伙的聚在一起，写大字报，看大字报。
    广大职工群众在鸣放中所提出的意见，绝大多数都是有关改进生产管理、生产技术、干部作风的。很多工人动脑筋研究问题，提出了有益于生产的重大意见。如沈阳空气压缩机厂第二加工车间刘金堂，针对车间机构庞大的情况提出了改革方案，按着他的方案，车间管理人员可以由六十六人减少到三十三人。五三工厂老工人李炳达在鸣放时对操作规程不符合实际提出了很多意见，给改进操作规程提供了有益的资料。
    各单位在发动职工大鸣大放的同时，都认真贯彻了边整边改的方针。凡是能马上解决的都马上解决；不能马上解决的，也制订了改进的措施。阜新新丘矿一坑风道漏风，通风不足，经常影响生产，工人贴出大字报批评后，现在已经彻底解决。鞍山第二矿山工程公司工长陈志新提出的关于仓库管理的合理化建议，已被压了一年多，这次提出批评后，公司经理马上动手处理，工人对领导上这种边整边改的作法很满意。
    在大鸣大放的同时，各厂矿职工都响应领导上提出的整风、生产两不误的号召，在生产上不断传出捷报。沈阳造纸厂、轧钢厂等三十多个企业的职工，9月份都在大鸣大放的同时提前超额完成了第三季度计划和增产节约计划。
    据新华社天津9日电　天津市工业企业的整风运动，经过二十多天的大鸣大放，现在已经或即将转入整顿思想作风、改进工作的新阶段。
    在这次大鸣大放中，全市三十万职工通过大字报、小组会、座谈会，畅所欲言，对企业的领导工作和领导干部提出了许多批评和建议。仅据二百四十多个单位的统计，从9月中旬到10月初共贴出大字报六十多万张，彻底揭露了企业领导工作各方面存在的缺点。职工群众提出的意见绝大多数是正确的或基本正确的。但也有少数意见暴露出工人阶级队伍中存在的非工人阶级思想意识，在大鸣大放中，这些意见引起了多数工人特别是老工人的不满，并开始展开辩论。
    工人阶级爱护共产党、爱护社会主义事业的热忱，深深地教育了工业企业的领导干部。他们消除了因自己有缺点怕“引火烧身”或“失掉威信”等顾虑以后，积极地贯彻了边整边改的方针。对于能够立即解决的意见都及时地加以解决。据二百四十多个工厂的统计，到目前为止已经解决了有关生产管理、生活福利、干部作风等方面的问题一万九千多件。当领导方面诚恳地接受工人的正确意见，并且坚决改正缺点以后，工人们对他们更加敬爱。在许多工厂的大字报上，出现了工人称赞厂长和党委书记坚决改进工作的快板和顺口溜。天津造纸总厂，天津铁路局车辆段等单位的工人还主动地帮助领导方面解决有关生产技术、生活福利方面的问题。
