Joint Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China, and The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria

At the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, a Bulgarian government delegation, headed by Anton Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, paid a friendly visit to China from September to October 1957.

During the visit, Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China received the delegation.

The government delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria visited the cities of Beijing, Changchun, Lushun, Dalian, Shenyang, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Hankou, and visited some major factories, agricultural producers' cooperatives, cultural and scientific institutions, and historical sites. Everywhere, the Chinese people gave the representatives of the Bulgarian people a warm reception, which clearly demonstrated the fraternal friendship and unity between the two peoples.

During the visit, the government delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria directly witnessed the great achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction. The delegation was deeply impressed by the enthusiasm of the Chinese working people in changing the face of their motherland and building a strong new socialist China. They saw the great prestige of the Chinese Communist Party among the broad masses of the people and the firm determination of the Chinese people to defend their revolutionary achievements and world peace.

During the visit, the leaders of the Government of the People's Republic of China held talks with the government delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

The Chinese side participating in the talks included Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs; Vice Premier Li Xiannian; Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang; Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian and Zeng Yongquan; Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Li Zheren; and Zhou Zhuan, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

The Bulgarian side participating in the talks included Anton Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Georgi Traikov, First Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Dimitar Ganef, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly and Secretary of the Central Committe of the Bulgarian Communist Party; Boris Taskov, Minister of Trade; Karlo Lukanov, Minister of Foreign Affairs; and Anton Neagarkov, Ambassador of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to the People's Republic of China.

The talks were conducted in an atmosphere of sincerity and complete understanding. The two sides discussed issues relating to the current international situation, strengthening the unity and cooperation of socialist countries, and further developing friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

During the talks, the two sides held completely identical views on the issues discussed. ×××

The two governments pointed out that after the failure of the military aggression against Egypt launched by the imperialist countries to stop the trend of further relaxation of the international situation in recent years, and the counter-revolutionary adventure in Hungary, the possibility of easing international tensions has reappeared. In order to realize this possibility, all peace-loving countries and people need to work together in the struggle against the aggressive plots of the imperialist forces, because the imperialist forces are still unwilling to accept their defeat and continue to pursue a "cold war" policy against the will of the people, threatening world peace.

The most urgent international issue to be resolved at present is the issue of disarmament. The settlement of the disarmament issue, which is firmly demanded by hundreds of millions of people in the world, will have a huge positive effect on easing international tensions and establishing mutual trust among countries. In the current international situation, it is of great significance to reach an agreement on some disarmament issues, first of all, on the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Both sides fully support the proposals put forward by the Soviet government at the 12th UN General Assembly on the declaration of peaceful coexistence among countries, the cessation of nuclear weapon tests under international supervision, the undertaking by countries not to use atomic weapons, and partial disarmament. The two sides condemn the Western countries for repeatedly refusing to accept the Soviet Union's reasonable proposals in the disarmament negotiations, and for using the negotiations to cover up their position on the arms race.

A great danger to European peace and security is West Germany's stepped-up rearmament and the transformation of its territory into a major military base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to conduct atomic warfare. This not only threatens the security of the peoples of European countries and the residents of West Germany itself, but is also a major obstacle to the restoration of German unity. Both sides believe that the German question, namely, the question of uniting Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country, is first and foremost a matter for the German people themselves. Both sides fully support the repeated proposals put forward by the government of the German Democratic Republic, which aim at adopting the only possible way, namely, promoting mutual understanding and rapprochement between the two existing German states, in order to realize the legitimate desire of the German people to unify their motherland.

The two governments note with great concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense again due to the intensified interference by US imperialism in the internal affairs of Arab countries. US imperialism has engineered an anti-popular coup in Jordan, and recently launched a series of serious provocations against Syria, attempting to overthrow Syria's nationally independent government through internal subversion and external armed intervention. These actions once again prove the colonialist essence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," with the United States striving to re-impose the shackles of colonialist enslavement on the peoples of Middle Eastern countries through the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Both sides firmly condemn this aggressive policy of the United States, which poses a serious danger to peace and security in the Middle East, and continue to support Syria's struggle against aggression and the struggle of the peoples of Middle Eastern countries for freedom and national independence.

The two governments reaffirm that the foreign policy of the two countries is based on the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. In accordance with this principle, both sides will continue to work to safeguard world peace, to establish trust and mutual understanding among all countries, and to develop cooperation among all peoples.

The two governments believe that the interests of world peace require the abolition of all existing military blocs and the replacement of these military blocs with a system of collective security and collective peace.

The Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports the peaceful policy adopted by the People's Republic of Bulgaria in its relations with Greece and Turkey. The purpose of this policy is to establish genuine good-neighborly relations with these countries in order to consolidate peace in the Balkans. The two governments fully agree with and support the initiative of the Government of the Romanian People's Republic to convene a high-level conference of Balkan countries and to sign a joint agreement guaranteeing peace, prosperity, and progress in the Balkans.

The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria fully supports the peaceful policy pursued by the People's Republic of China in resolving international issues, and believes that the efforts made by the People's Republic of China to develop friendly and cooperative relations between Asian and African countries in accordance with the Five Principles and the resolutions of the Bandung Conference are greatly conducive to consolidating peace in Asia and Africa.

In order to oppose socialist countries and divert world public opinion from accusations of its aggressive activities, US imperialism recently hijacked the United Nations to convene a special meeting to discuss the so-called "Hungarian question," and passed a shameful resolution aimed at interfering in Hungary's internal affairs. This not only completely violates the basic principles of the UN Charter but also seriously damages the UN's own prestige. Both sides declare that any resolution passed by the UN under US manipulation attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Hungary is illegal and invalid. The two governments will continue to fully support the Hungarian people's sacred struggle to defend national sovereignty and the socialist cause.

Both sides support the reasonable desire of the Korean and Vietnamese peoples to peacefully reunify their countries, and fully support the efforts made by the governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to achieve this goal in accordance with peaceful and democratic principles.

The two governments note with great satisfaction that the unity and fraternal cooperation among socialist countries, united by the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the common goal of building socialism and communism, are being increasingly consolidated and developed. Their mutual relations are based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and national equality and are subject to a supreme interest, which is to strive for lasting peace and the victory of socialism and communism.

At present, the imperialist forces are continuing to carry out sabotage and provocative activities against peace and against socialism. In this international situation, the close unity and friendly cooperation among socialist countries is the most important condition for smashing the aggressive plots of the imperialist blocs. The two governments will resolutely continue to consolidate the iron-like unity among the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The two sides discussed the issue of further strengthening the friendly relations and fraternal cooperation between the two countries during the talks. Both sides noted with satisfaction that the economic and cultural exchanges between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Bulgaria are developing smoothly. This exchange is in line with the interests of the socialist peaceful construction of the two countries. In order to further expand economic cooperation between the two countries and to place this cooperation on a planned basis, the two governments signed an agreement on the exchange of goods and payments for the period from 1958 to 1960.

Anton Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, invited Zhou Enlai, Prime Minister of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and other Chinese leaders, to pay an official visit to Bulgaria. This invitation has been gladly accepted.

Both sides are deeply convinced that the visit of the government delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to China and the talks held between the leaders of the two governments are of great significance to further developing the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, to strengthening the unity among socialist countries, and to promoting world peace.

    在访问期间，中华人民共和国政府领导人和保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团进行了会谈。
    中国方面参加会谈的有国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来，副总理李先念，对外贸易部部长叶季壮，外交部副部长张闻天、曾涌泉，对外贸易部副部长李哲人，中华人民共和国驻保加利亚人民共和国大使周竹安。

    会谈是在真诚和完全谅解的空气中进行的。双方讨论了有关当前国际形势、加强社会主义国家团结合作和进一步发展中华人民共和国和保加利亚人民共和国友好关系的各方面的问题。
    在会谈中，双方对所讨论的问题具有完全一致的看法。×××
    两国政府指出，在帝国主义国家为了阻止近年来国际形势进一步走向和缓的趋势所发动的对埃及的军事侵略和在匈牙利的反革命冒险失败以后，重新出现了和缓国际紧张局势的可能。为了实现这种可能，就需要所有爱好和平的国家和人民在反对帝国主义势力侵略阴谋的斗争中共同努力，因为帝国主义势力还不甘心于他们的失败，并且违反人民的意志继续推行“冷战”政策，威胁世界和平。
    当前最迫切需要解决的国际问题就是裁军问题。世界上亿万人民坚决要求的裁军问题的解决，将对和缓国际紧张局势和在各国间建立互信起着巨大的积极作用。在当前的国际形势下，就裁军的一部分问题，首先是就完全禁止原子武器和氢武器问题达成协议，是具有重大的意义的。双方完全支持苏联政府在第十二届联合国大会上就各国和平共处的宣言、在国际监督下停止试验核武器、各国承担不使用原子武器的义务和局部裁军等问题所提出的建议。双方谴责西方国家在裁军谈判中一再拒绝接受苏联的合理建议，并且利用谈判掩盖军备竞赛的立场。
    对欧洲和平和安全的一个巨大危险，就是西德加紧重整军备，并且把它的领土变为北大西洋公约组织进行原子战争的主要军事基地。这不仅威胁着欧洲各国人民和西德本国居民的安全，而且也是恢复德国人民统一的一个主要障碍。双方认为，德国问题，即把德国统一为一个爱好和平的民主国家的问题，首先是德国人民自己的事情。双方完全支持德意志民主共和国政府一再提出的建议，这些建议的目的在于采用唯一可能的办法，即促使现存的两个德国相互了解和接近的办法来实现德国人民统一他们的祖国的合法愿望。
    两国政府十分关切地注意到，由于美帝国主义加紧了对阿拉伯各国内政的干涉，中近东的局势再度紧张起来。美帝国主义在约旦制造了反人民的政变，最近又对叙利亚发动了一系列严重的挑衅，妄图用内部颠覆和外来的武装干涉的办法推翻叙利亚的民族独立政府。这些行动再一次证明了“艾森豪威尔主义”的殖民主义实质，美国正力图通过“艾森豪威尔主义”把殖民主义奴役的枷锁重新加在中近东各国人民的身上。双方坚决谴责美国这种对中近东地区的和平和安全孕育着严重危险的侵略政策，并且继续支持叙利亚反对侵略和中近东各国人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争。
    两国政府再次确认，两国对外政策是基于不同社会制度的国家之间和平共处的原则。双方将本着这个原则为维护世界和平，为在所有各国之间建立信任和相互了解，为发展所有各国人民之间的合作而继续努力。
    两国政府认为，世界和平的利益要求取消现有的一切军事集团，并且用集体安全和集体和平的体系来代替这些军事集团。
    中华人民共和国政府完全支持保加利亚人民共和国在同希腊和土耳其的关系上所采取的和平政策。这个政策的目的在于同这些国家建立真正睦邻关系，以利于巩固巴尔干地区的和平。两国政府完全同意和支持罗马尼亚人民共和国政府关于召开巴尔干国家最高级会议和签订一项保证巴尔干地区和平和繁荣进步的共同协定的倡议。
    保加利亚人民共和国政府完全支持中华人民共和国在解决国际问题上所执行的和平政策，并且认为中华人民共和国根据五项原则和万隆会议各项决议，为发展亚非各国之间的友好合作关系所作的努力，大大有利于巩固亚非地区的和平。
    美帝国主义为了反对社会主义国家，转移世界舆论对它的侵略活动的指责，最近挟持联合国召开特别会议讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”，并且通过了旨在干涉匈牙利内政的可耻的决议。这不仅完全违反联合国宪章的基本原则，而且严重损害了联合国本身的威信。双方声明，联合国在美国操纵下通过的企图干涉匈牙利人民共和国内政的任何决议都是非法的和无效的。两国政府将继续全力支持匈牙利人民捍卫国家主权和社会主义事业的神圣斗争。
    双方支持朝鲜人民和越南人民要求和平统一自己祖国的合理愿望，并且完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和越南民主共和国政府按照和平、民主的原则为实现这一目标所作的努力。
    两国政府极为满意地注意到，为伟大的马克思列宁主义思想和建设社会主义和共产主义的共同目标所联合起来的社会主义各国之间的团结和兄弟般的合作正在日益巩固和发展。他们之间的相互关系是建立在无产阶级国际主义和民族平等的原则之上的，并且服从于一个最高的利益，就是争取持久和平和社会主义、共产主义的胜利。
    目前帝国主义势力正在继续进行反对和平、反对社会主义的破坏和挑衅的活动。在这种国际形势下，社会主义各国之间的紧密团结和友好合作是粉碎帝国主义集团侵略阴谋的最重要的条件。两国政府将坚决地继续巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国间钢铁般的团结。
    双方在会谈中讨论了进一步加强两国友好关系和兄弟合作的问题。双方满意地注意到，中华人民共和国和保加利亚人民共和国之间的经济和文化交流正在顺利地发展着。这种交流是符合于两国社会主义和平建设的利益的。为了进一步扩大两国间的经济合作并且使这种合作建立在有计划的基础上，两国政府签订了1958年到1960年期间交换货物和付款的协定。
    保加利亚人民共和国部长会议主席安东·于哥夫代表保加利亚人民共和国政府邀请了中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来和其他中国领导人员到保加利亚进行友好访问。这项邀请已经被满意地接受。
    双方深信，保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团在中国的访问和两国政府领导人之间所举行的会谈对进一步发展中华人民共和国和保加利亚人民共和国之间的兄弟友谊和合作，对加强社会主义各国之间的团结和世界和平是一个重大贡献。
