    Welcome the Great Artist Oistrakh
    Zhang Yan, Head of the Orchestral Department of the Central Conservatory of Music

    As our nation joyfully celebrates the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, the Soviet government has sent one of the most outstanding performing artists of our time – People's Artist of the USSR, recipient of the Order of Lenin, First Class Stalin Prize winner, violinist Professor David Oistrakh to visit and perform in our country. This fully demonstrates the great friendship of the Soviet people towards our people, and we sincerely welcome this emissary of the great neighboring country with gratitude and immense joy.

    Oistrakh's brilliant achievements have been renowned globally since he won first prize at the Eugène Ysaÿe International Violin Competition in Brussels, Belgium, in 1937. That competition involved representatives from twenty-one countries – sixty-eight of the world's most outstanding violinists, including five Soviet violinists. The competition program was extremely difficult, requiring violinists to pass through three rounds of competition. The final results were as follows: the Soviet Union won five of the six first prizes, with Oistrakh taking first place. This magnificent achievement shocked the world, and since then, Oistrakh's performing art has reached an unprecedented peak, hailed by a vast audience of music lovers as "the world's first violin" and "the king of the violin."

    Another groundbreaking achievement that shook the art world was his series of recitals in the 1946-1947 Soviet music season at the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, titled "The Development of the Violin Concerto." It lasted for five consecutive days, featuring concertos from ancient Bach to the contemporary Soviet composer Khachaturian, including works by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Elgar, Chausson, Vieuxtemps, Sibelius, Taneyev, Glazunov, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, and Khachaturian. These works are the greatest, most profound, most exquisite, and most difficult in the violin repertoire. Never before in the history of violin performance has anyone dared to perform such a rich, diverse, and numerous selection of concertos in the same period with such magnificent ambition!

    Oistrakh handles these works as an artist, deeply and correctly sensing their ideological essence, style, and form, and truthfully expressing their content. In performing music from different eras and different nations, he displays rare creativity. In these fifteen violin works, his artistic genius is fully demonstrated.

    The emergence of a great artist in the contemporary Soviet Union is not accidental. The socialist system has stimulated the initiative of the broadest masses, awakening unprecedented creative enthusiasm in the hearts of millions. This is an immutable reality determined by the objective laws of social development. The Soviet violinists' great victory in Brussels powerfully illustrates this truth. Why couldn't the talented artists of capitalist countries achieve victory? The talented Italian violinist who participated in the competition but failed to win once answered this question, saying to his Soviet counterparts: "I have to work for a living. To come to Brussels, I barely managed to spare one or two hours each day for practice! But your situation is completely different. You don't have to worry about material conditions. Your country helps you, and your country has all the conditions to make the ranks of talented musicians grow year by year." Oistrakh also said at the time: "At this international violin competition, the Soviet violin school has achieved victory. From the first minute of the competition, each of us felt that the entire great Soviet Union was watching us. All the working people of our country would be happy for our every victory. When the judging committee announced the decision, our hearts were filled with joy because our achievements are the achievements of the motherland, the achievements of all the Soviet people."

    In addition to the objective premise of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, the artist's personal qualities should also be mentioned. Here is a passage from the contemporary Soviet composer Shostakovich about Oistrakh: "Once, – this was several years ago in Berlin – Oistrakh and I lived in adjacent hotel rooms. He was going to hold a concert in two days, playing Tchaikovsky's concerto. Needless to say, he had played it more than a hundred times, yet he still practiced all day long, again and again, as if it were his first time on stage. It is the combination of great talent and hard work; the combination of inspiration and refined technique that has brought him immortal world renown!" This is an outstanding example for art workers, an example of the inseparability of talent and labor.

    Oistrakh creatively mastered the traditions of the Russian performing school. Naturalness, authenticity, sincerity, and simplicity are characteristics that are not only reflected in his performing style but also in his stage demeanor.

    It is also necessary to mention Oistrakh's great achievements as a violin teacher. In 1934, he was hired as a teacher at the Soviet State Moscow Conservatory. Long-term teaching experience has enabled him to think more deeply about the most complex performing processes and to theoretically prove the true significance of his artistic practice. His extremely rich artistic practice has also tested the correctness of his theories in the classroom. Therefore, his performance and teaching mutually help each other. For more than twenty years, he has cultivated many excellent young violinists, forming the most glorious page of the Soviet performing school in the history of violin performance.

    "Oistrakh is not only the best representative of Soviet performing art but also of the world's. His achievements should be evaluated from a global perspective." This is the unanimous praise of European and American art critics. We once again thank the great Soviet government and people for their profound friendship, and with the best wishes, congratulate Professor Oistrakh and his outstanding collaborator, pianist Vladimir Yampolsky, on the great success of their performances in our country.

    欢迎伟大的艺术家奥伊斯特拉赫
    中央音乐学院管弦系系主任　章彦
    当我国全国人民正在欢欣鼓舞庆祝建国八周年的时期，苏联政府派遣了当代最杰出的演奏艺术家——苏联人民演员、列宁勋章获得者、斯大林奖金一等奖获得者、小提琴家达维德·奥伊斯特拉赫教授前来我国访问演出，充分表现了苏联人民对我国人民的伟大友谊，我们由衷的怀着感谢和无比的快乐来欢迎这位伟大邻邦的人民使者。
    奥伊斯特拉赫的光辉业绩，自从1937年参加比国首都布鲁塞尔的爱然·伊扎伊小提琴国际竞赛会荣获第一名以后就已经斐声全球。那次的竞赛会共有二十一个国家的代表——六十八位世界最优秀的小提琴家参加，其中有五位是苏联的小提琴家。竞赛节目非常艰难，小提琴家们要通过三轮比赛，比赛的最后结果是这样的：六个一等奖苏联得了五个，奥伊斯特拉赫荣获第一名。这个辉煌的成绩惊震了全世界，从此以后，奥伊斯特拉赫的演奏艺术达到了前所未有的顶峰，被广大的音乐欣赏者誉为“世界上第一把小提琴”，“小提琴之王”。
    另一个震动艺术界的创举是他在1946—1947的苏联音乐季中在莫斯科音乐院大厅举行以“小提琴协奏曲的发展”为名的独奏会，一连进行了五天，演奏从古代巴哈到苏联当代作家哈恰图良的协奏曲，包括巴哈、贝多芬、勃拉姆斯、莫扎特、门德尔松、爱尔加、萧松、乌奥尔童、西比里乌斯、塔涅耶夫、格拉祖诺夫、柴可夫斯基、普罗科菲耶夫、哈恰图良的作品。这些作品都是小提琴文献中最伟大、最深刻、最精美而又最艰难的作品，在小提琴演奏史上从未曾有人具有这样宏伟的气魄敢于在同一个时期内演出如此丰富的、如此各不相同的、为数如此众多的协奏曲！
    奥伊斯特拉赫是作为一个艺术家来处理这些作品的，他深刻、正确地感觉到它们的思想实质、风格和形式，他真实地表现了它们的内容。在演奏不同时代、不同民族的音乐时，他表现了稀有的创造性。在这十五首小提琴作品里，充分地表现了他的艺术天才。
    伟大的艺术家产生于当代的苏联，不是偶然的——社会主义制度激发了最广大群众的积极性，在千百万人的心灵里，唤醒了从未曾有过的创造热情——这是一个为客观的社会发展规律所决定了的，不容改变的现实。苏联小提琴家在布鲁塞尔的巨大胜利就可以有力地说明这个真理。为什么资本主义国家的天才艺术家们不能获得胜利呢？当时曾参加竞赛而落选的意大利天才提琴家曾经解答了这个问题，他对苏联的同行说：“我必须为生活而工作，为了到布鲁塞尔来，我好不容易才每天匀出了一二小时来练习！而你们的情况就完全是另外的样子，你们不必为物质条件操心，你们的国家帮助你们，你们的国家有一切条件使有天才的音乐家的行列一年比一年增大起来”。奥伊斯特拉赫当时也曾说道：“在这次小提琴国际竞赛会上，苏联小提琴学派取得了胜利，我们每个人从比赛的第一分钟起就感到整个伟大的苏联都在注视我们，我们国家的全体劳动人民都将因我们的每一个胜利而高兴，当评判委员会公布了决议时，我们的心都充满了快乐，因为我们的成就就是祖国的成就，就是全苏人民的成就。”
    除了社会主义制度的无比优越性的客观前题之外，艺术家个人的优良品质也是应该提到的，这里引用了当代苏联伟大作曲家萧斯塔科维奇谈奥伊斯特拉赫的一节话：“有一次，——这是好几年以前在柏林的事——我和奥斯伊特拉赫住的旅馆房间相毗邻，他过两天就要举行音乐会，演奏柴可夫斯基的协奏曲，不用说，他演奏过它已经不止一百次了，尽管如此，他还是成天地，再三地练习，就好像初次出场似的。正是巨大天才和辛勤劳动的配合；灵感启示和精练技巧的结合，才给他带来了不朽的世界声誉！”这是一个艺术工作者的杰出的范例，天才与劳动不可分割的范例。
    奥伊斯特拉赫创造性地掌握了俄罗斯演奏学派的传统，自然、真实、恳切与纯朴，这些特点不仅表现在他的演奏风格上，同样也表现在他的舞台风度上。
    这里还必须提及奥伊斯特拉赫作为小提琴教师的伟大业迹，他在1934年就被聘为苏联国立莫斯科音乐学院的教师，长期的教学经验使他更深刻地去思考最复杂的演奏过程，使他从理论上去证明他的艺术实践的真实意义；他的极其丰富的艺术实践也检验了他在课堂的理论的正确性。因此，他的演奏与教学相互起着帮助的作用。二十多年来他已经培养出不少优秀的青年小提琴家，在小提琴演奏史上形成了苏联演奏学派的最光辉的一页。
    “奥伊斯特拉赫不仅是苏联的，而且也是世界的演奏艺术最优秀的代表，他的成就应该以世界范围的观点来加以评价。”这是欧美艺术评论家们一致的推崇。我们再一次的感谢伟大的苏联政府与人民的崇高友情，并以最好的祝愿祝贺奥伊斯特拉赫教授和他的杰出的合作者、钢琴家弗拉季米尔·扬波尔斯基在我国演出的伟大成功。
