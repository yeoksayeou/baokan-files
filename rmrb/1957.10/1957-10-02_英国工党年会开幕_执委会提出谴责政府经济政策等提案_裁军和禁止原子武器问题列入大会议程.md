    Our Correspondent in Brighton, 30th — The 56th Annual Conference of the British Labour Party opened here today.

    This annual conference is being held under the following circumstances: Firstly, the Labour Party Executive Committee's programmatic document on nationalization, "Public Ownership and Industry," will be submitted to this annual conference for discussion and approval. As has been criticized, this document effectively abandons the Labour Party's "nationalization" policy and promotes moving towards "socialism" through the stock exchange. The publication of this document has caused considerable debate and confusion within the Labour Party. Secondly, the British people have expressed strong dissatisfaction with some of the economic measures recently taken by the Conservative government under the pretext of "defending the pound." Labour Party representatives from the grassroots have brought this sentiment into the conference.

    Therefore, at a rally on the eve of the conference, Labour leader Gaitskell delivered a speech attacking the Conservative government. Gaitskell said that the Conservative government's raising of the bank rate to 7% "is a declaration of war on the trade unions." He concluded his speech by declaring that "the time for a new government has come."

    The Labour Party Executive Committee also proactively put forward two emergency resolutions — condemning the Conservative government's economic policies and condemning the government's rent bill. The first day of the conference was devoted to discussing and unanimously passing these two resolutions. Labour's Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Wilson, spoke on the emergency resolution regarding the economic situation. He criticized the Conservative's economic policies, accusing Macmillan of "pawning" Britain to the United States and West Germany. He also demanded that Macmillan step down.

    Labour Party Chairman Miss Hoppison, in her opening speech, condemned the Conservative's policies for causing a decline in Britain's gold and dollar reserves and a contraction in production. She called for a speedy resolution of the disarmament issue, especially the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. She suggested withdrawing foreign troops from Germany and establishing a neutral zone in Europe. She considered it unreasonable to exclude China from the United Nations; but at the same time, she advocated that Taiwan should be placed under the control of United Nations forces, "after a period of time, the future of the island should be decided by a plebiscite of the people of the island—either as part of China or as an independent country."

    At today's meeting, some representatives from the grassroots expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the Conservative government in their speeches. They demanded immediate action to force the government to hold a general election.

    However, all indications show that there is still a considerable distance between the Labour Party leadership and the grassroots representatives on this issue. Whether it was the speeches of Gaitskell, Hoppison, and Wilson, or the several resolutions that have already been passed, none called on the masses to take action to force the Conservative government to step down. Some believe that the Labour Party leaders' attacks on the Conservative government are largely to win the support of ordinary Labour Party members for the leadership and to smoothly pass the Labour Party's new "nationalization" program under the slogan of "party unity."

    In the coming days, the conference will discuss the pension plan and the new "nationalization" program proposed by the Labour Party Executive Committee. Disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons have also been included in the conference agenda as an important issue.

    英国工党年会开幕
    执委会提出谴责政府经济政策等提案
    裁军和禁止原子武器问题列入大会议程
    本报布莱顿30日电  英国工党第五十六届年会，今天在此间开幕。
    这次年会，是在这样的情况下举行的：一、工党执委会关于国有化问题的纲领性文件“公有制与工业”，将提交本届年会讨论与批准。如同人们所批评的，这个文件实际上放弃了工党的“国有化”政策，并且提倡经过股票交易所走向“社会主义”。这个文件发表后，在工党内部引起了很大的争论和混乱。二、英国人民对保守党政府最近在“保卫英镑”的口实下，所采取的一些经济措施表示了强烈的不满。来自基层的工党代表们，把这种情绪带进了大会。
    因此，在大会前夕的一个集会上，工党领袖盖次克尔发表了抨击保守党政府的演说。盖次克尔说：保守党政府提高银行利率到7％，“是对工会的宣战。”他在结束演说时，宣称“换一个新政府的时候已经到来了。”
    工党执委会还主动地提出了两个紧急提案——谴责保守党政府的经济政策和谴责政府的房租法案。大会的第一天就这两个提案进行了讨论，并一致通过。工党影子内阁的财政大臣威尔逊就关于经济局势的紧急提案作了发言。他抨击了保守党的经济政策，指责麦克米伦把英国“典当”给美国和西德。他也同样地要求麦克米伦下台。
    工党主席霍皮逊小姐在开幕词中谴责了保守党的政策使英国的黄金美元储备下降，生产萎缩。她要求尽快解决裁军问题，特别是停止试验核武器问题。她建议撤退德国的外国驻军，在欧洲建立中立区。她认为把中国排斥在联合国之外是不合理的；但同时又主张：台湾应置于联合国军队的控制之下，“经过一个时期后，由该岛人民以公民投票的办法来决定自己的前途——或者作为中国的一部分，或者成为独立国家。”
    在今天的会议上，一些来自基层的代表，在发言中表示了对保守党政府的极端不满。他们要求立即采取行动，迫使政府进行大选。
    但是，种种迹象表明，在这一问题上，工党领导集团同基层代表之间，还有很大的距离。不管是盖次克尔、霍皮逊和威尔逊的发言也好，或者是已经通过的几个决议也好，都没有号召群众进入行动，以迫使保守党政府下台。有人认为，工党领袖对保守党政府的抨击，在很大程度上是为了赢得工党普通党员对领导集团的支持，并在“全党团结”的口号下，顺利地通过工党新的“国有化”纲领。
    在今后几天的会议中，将讨论工党执委会提出的养老金计划和“国有化”新纲领。裁军和禁止原子武器，也已作为一个重要的问题列入了大会议程。
