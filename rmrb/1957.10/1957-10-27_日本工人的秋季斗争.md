    Autumn Struggle of Japanese Workers
    Lan Hai
    Since Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States in June this year, the reactionary nature of the Japanese government's foreign and domestic policies has become increasingly evident. Externally, it has become more subservient to the United States, implementing anti-communist and anti-neutralist policies; internally, it has intensified its crackdown on progressive forces and launched an offensive against the labor movement. The Kishi Nobusuke government's heavy-handed punishment of activists who participated in this year's spring struggle, and the recent arrest of many activists from support groups for the Sunagawa struggle under the pretext of violating the "Special Criminal Law" enacted under the U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement, are all manifestations of this reactionary policy. This reactionary policy of suppressing progressive forces and attacking the labor movement is paving the way for revising the Constitution, further expanding armaments, and transforming Japan into a U.S. atomic strategic base. At the same time, it also attempts to maintain a low-wage policy through high-pressure tactics, strengthen the international competitiveness of Japanese goods, and facilitate the expansion of exports, consolidating the ruling power of Japanese monopoly capital.
    Faced with the Japanese government's suppression, the Japanese working class has responded by launching an autumn struggle with even greater momentum. The Japanese workers' autumn struggle has now become the center of the nationwide struggle by the Japanese people to safeguard their lives and rights and defend peace.
    The ten thousand steelworkers fired the first shot of the autumn struggle. Under the leadership of the Japan Iron and Steel Industry Workers' Union Federation, they held a 24-hour general strike on October 8, demanding that large companies increase wages by 3,000 yen and small and medium-sized companies increase wages by 2,000 to 3,000 yen.
    All eight blast furnaces and thirty-six open-hearth furnaces of Yawata Iron & Steel Works, the largest in Japan, stopped working. All 34,500 workers of Yawata Iron & Steel Works, except for a few security personnel, left their posts and joined other working people in holding a "Prefectural People's Congress to Protect Life and Rights" in Yawata Park. The congress passed a declaration stating that steelworkers would unite with shipbuilding, national railway, and coal mine workers to strive for the victory of the struggle. After the meeting, the workers shouted slogans such as "Down with the Kishi Cabinet" and held a demonstration.
    At the same time, steelworkers across the country, including those at Kawasaki Steel Works Kawasaki Steel Plant and Tsurumi Steel Plant in Kawasaki, and Sumitomo factories in Osaka, also held strikes. On October 8 alone, the four major companies of Yawata, Fuji Iron & Steel, Nippon Kokan, and Sumitomo lost more than 11,000 tons of pig iron, 21,000 tons of steel ingots, 15,000 tons of semi-finished products, and 15,000 tons of steel products. The losses suffered by the capitalists amounted to more than 1 billion yen.
    The ten thousand steelworkers held a second and third 48-hour general strike on October 11 and 17. They also plan to hold a fourth and fifth strike to strive for a complete victory in the struggle.
    The 59,000 shipbuilding workers of fifteen companies affiliated with the All Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union and the 76,000 transportation workers of the All Japan Express Co. Workers' Union also began strikes on October 12 and 17, respectively, demanding wage increases.
    The wages of Japanese steelworkers are only 33% of those of British steelworkers, compared to those in the UK with roughly the same production equipment and efficiency. Compared with pre-war levels, they are only 83%. Japanese steelworkers have to work dozens of hours of overtime each month, and only with overtime pay can they barely maintain their families. The situation for shipbuilding workers and transportation workers is not much different. Due to excessive labor intensity, work-related accidents also occur frequently. From January to October 3 this year, 103 workers have died in various accidents in shipbuilding in Japan. Japanese monopoly capitalists rely on this low-wage policy and intensified labor to seize huge profits and use these profits to expand equipment, attempting to make their enterprises become munitions factories for the entire Asia. How can Japanese workers not rise up and fight against this reactionary policy?
    The 200,000 workers of the Japan Coal Miners' Union have also launched a heroic struggle. The 4,300 workers of the Kijima Coal Mine in Saga Prefecture have been on an indefinite strike since August 2 to oppose the company's reduction of working conditions under the pretext of enterprise restructuring, and have persisted for more than seventy days. The struggle of the 4,000 workers of Kijima is not only related to their own survival, but will also directly affect whether the capitalists continue to launch attacks on the working conditions of all coal miners. On September 30, the Japan Coal Miners' Union ordered more than 146,000 workers in thirteen major coal mines to hold a 24-hour sympathy strike. Obviously, the Kishi government's Minister of Labor, Ishida, threatened that "sympathy strikes are illegal," but the coal miners were not moved in the slightest. For workers in one enterprise to go on strike, and almost all workers in the same industry to hold sympathy strikes to support them, this is an epoch-making feat in the history of the Japanese labor movement. To demand an increase in retirement allowances, the Japan Coal Miners' Union ordered workers in thirteen major coal mines to hold an indefinite strike together on October 17. The united struggle of workers in these private large-scale enterprise unions in steel, shipbuilding, and coal mines is a great encouragement to the broad masses of Japanese people who demand peace and the protection of their lives and rights, and has strengthened their confidence in the struggle.
    Japanese national railway workers, united around the National Railway Workers' Union (370,000 members) and the Locomotive Engineers' Union (53,000 members), paralyzed the national transportation system in this year's spring struggle, demonstrating enormous power. The Kishi government has painstakingly tried to undermine and divide the National Railway Workers' Union, thereby attacking the entire labor movement. To this end, the Kishi government has dismissed 50 cadres of the National Railway Workers' Union and the Locomotive Engineers' Union, arrested 40 union activists, and disciplined 55,000 union activists. On the other hand, it has instigated wavering elements (employees) to organize a second union, attempting to split the National Railway Workers' Union. Although the second union has received the full support of the National Railway authorities, it has only managed to gather 3,000 members so far. The National Railway authorities conducted collective bargaining with this "union" of only 3,000 members, promising to grant salary increases this year to 90% of those eligible for regular salary increases. However, it refused to conduct collective bargaining with the National Railway Workers' Union and the Locomotive Engineers' Union, citing the fact that the two unions still used people who had been dismissed by the government as cadres, and did not recognize them as legal unions. On September 26, the National Railway Workers' Union issued instructions, demanding collective bargaining, 100% implementation of regular salary increases, and an increase in the necessary personnel with the revision of train schedules, and launched a legal struggle.
    In the high tide of the workers' autumn struggle, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, neutral trade unions, farmers, women, students, peace groups, and the Socialist Party and the Communist Party jointly launched the "National Congress for the Defense of Peace, Life, and Rights" in 230 cities across the country on October 12. In Tokyo, more than 40,000 people participated in the central congress, which was divided into two venues. The congress put forward slogans against the government's suppression of the labor movement, the establishment of a minimum wage system of 8,000 yen, opposition to price increases, opposition to the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan, opposition to the establishment of atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb bases, and the abolition of unequal treaties. It also adopted a declaration, stating that the people of all strata in Japan, with the working class as the center, would strengthen unity and unification and resolutely fight to the end to change the government's reactionary policies.
    Currently, the Japanese workers' autumn struggle is unfolding vigorously. The Japanese working class clearly knows that the Kishi Nobusuke government and monopoly capital will not easily accept their demands; on the contrary, they will strengthen suppression or use appeasement tactics to divide the backbone of the unions. It is precisely for this reason that the Japanese working class regards strengthening unity as their primary task. They will unite with all Japanese people who demand peace, democracy, and independence, and fight tirelessly to win the victory of the struggle. (Attached picture)

    日本工人的秋季斗争
    蓝海
    今年6月日本首相岸信介访问美国之后，日本政府的对外对内政策的反动化日益暴露得明显了。对外，它更加屈从美国，执行反共、反中立主义的政策；对内，则加紧打击进步势力，向工人运动展开了进攻。岸信介政府对于参加今年春季斗争的工人积极分子的大量处分，不久以前借口违反根据日美行政协定制定的“刑事特别法”检举了许多支援砂川斗争团体的活动家，就都是这种反动政策的体现。而这种打击进步势力、进攻工人运动的反动政策，又是为修改宪法，进一步扩大军备，变日本为美国原子战略基地铺平道路的。同时，也企图通过高压手段，维持低工资政策，加强日本商品的国际竞争力量，以利于扩大输出，巩固日本垄断资本的统治势力。
    面对着日本政府的镇压，日本工人阶级的回答是：以更壮阔的声势展开了秋季斗争。日本工人的秋季斗争现在已成为日本全国人民在各地展开的维护生活和权利、保卫和平的斗争的中心。
    打响秋季斗争第一炮的是十万钢铁工人。他们在日本钢铁产业工会联合会的领导下，在10月8日举行了二十四小时的全面罢工，提出了大公司增加工资三千日元，中小公司增加工资二千至三千日元的要求。
    号称日本最大的八幡制铁所的八座高炉、三十六座平炉全部停止了工作。八幡制铁所的三万四千五百名工人，除了留下若干保安人员外，全部离开工作岗位，同其他劳动人民一道在八幡公园举行了“维护生活和权利县民大会”。大会通过一项宣言，表示钢铁工人要同造船、国营铁道、煤矿工人团结一致争取斗争的胜利。会后工人们高喊“打倒岸内阁”的口号，举行了游行示威。
    同时，川崎的日本钢管川崎制铁所、鹤见制铁所、大阪的住友工厂等全国各地的钢铁工人也一齐举行了罢工。仅10月8日这一天，八幡、富士制铁、日本钢管、住友四家大公司就损失了生铁一万一千余吨、钢块二万一千吨、半制品一万五千吨、钢材一万五千吨的生产。资本家蒙受的损失达十亿日元以上。
    十万钢铁工人在10月11日、17日又接着举行了第二次、第三次四十八小时全面罢工。他们还计划举行第四次、第五次罢工，以争取斗争的全胜。
    全日本造船工会所属十五家公司的五万九千名造船工人和全日本通运公司工会所属七万六千名运输工人，也分别于10月12日、17日开始罢工，要求增加工资。
    日本钢铁工人的工资，同生产设备和生产效率大致相同的英国比较，只及英国钢铁工人工资的33％。同战前比较也只达83％。日本钢铁工人每月要作几十个钟点的加班，加上加班费才能勉强维持一家生活。造船工人、运输工人的状况也相差无几。由于劳动强度过甚，工伤事故也不断发生。自今年1月以来，至10月3日为止，在日本各地造船行，已有一百零三名工人由于各种事故而死亡。日本垄断资本家依靠这种低工资政策和加强劳动强度的办法，攫取了庞大利润，并把这些利润用于扩大设备，企图使他们的企业成为整个亚洲的军火工厂。对于这种反动政策，日本工人怎么能不起来进行斗争呢？
    日本煤矿工会的二十万工人也展开了英勇斗争。使贺县杵岛煤矿工会的四千三百名工人，为反对公司借口整顿企业而降低劳动条件，从8月2日起开始不定期限的罢工，至今已坚持七十余日。杵岛四千工人的斗争，不仅关系他们自己的死活，而且将直接影响到资本家是否继续向所有煤矿工人的劳动条件展开进攻。日本煤矿工会于9月30日下令十三家主要煤矿的十四万六千余名工人举行二十四小时的同情罢工。显然岸政府的石田劳动相曾威胁说，“同情罢工是违法的”，但煤矿工人丝毫未为所动。对于一个企业的工人罢工，同一产业的几乎全部工人举行同情罢工加以支援，这在日本工人运动史上是划时代的壮举。日本煤矿工会为了要求增加退职津贴，又于10月17日下令十三家主要煤矿的工人一齐举行不定期限的罢工。钢铁、造船、煤矿等这些私营大企业工会工人的团结一致的斗争，对于要求和平，要求维护生活和权利的日本广大人民是一个很大鼓舞，增强了他们的斗争信心。
    日本国营铁道工人，团结在国营铁道工会（三十七万会员）和机车工会（五万三千名会员）周围，在今年春季斗争中，曾使全国运输系统陷于瘫痪，显示了巨大威力。岸政府处心积虑地想要破坏和分化国营铁道工会，从而打击整个工人运动。为此，岸政府曾解雇五十名国营铁道工会和机车工会的干部，逮捕了四十名工会活动家，并处分了五万五千名工会积极分子。另一方面又唆使动摇分子（职员）组织第二工会，企图使国营铁道工会陷于分裂。第二工会虽有国营铁道当局的尽心支持，至今却只不过搜罗了三千名会员。国营铁道当局同这个只有三千名会员的“工会”进行了集体谈判，答应今年将对90％有资格取得定期增薪的人给予增薪。而对国营铁道工会和机车工会，则借口该两工会仍以被政府解雇了的人作为干部，不承认它们是合法工会，拒绝进行集体谈判。国营铁道工会在9月26日发出指令，提出进行集体谈判、百分之百地实行定期增薪、随着火车运行表的改订增加必要人员等要求，展开了守法斗争。
    在工人秋季斗争高潮中，由日本工会总评议会、中立工会、农民、妇女、学生、和平团体和社会党、共产党等联合发起，于10月12日分别在全国二百三十个城市举行了“保卫和平、维护生活和权利国民大会”。在东京，有四万多人参加了分为两个会场的中央大会。大会提出了反对政府镇压工人运动、制定八千日元的最低工资制度、反对提高物价、反对把核武器运进日本、反对建立原子弹氢弹基地，废除不平等条约等口号，并通过了宣言，表示以工人阶级为中心的日本各阶层人民将加强团结和统一，为改变政府的反动政策而坚决斗争到底。
    目前，日本工人的秋季斗争正在如火如荼地展开着。日本工人阶级清楚地知道：岸信介政府和垄断资本，不会轻易接受他们的要求，相反地它们会加强镇压或以怀柔手段分化工会的骨干。正因为如此，日本工人阶级才把加强团结看成为他们首要的任务。他们将和所有要求和平、民主、独立的日本人民一道，团结一致为争取斗争的胜利奋斗不息。（附图片）
