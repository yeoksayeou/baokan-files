This reporter, Tang Baoshun, reports from Changchun on the 28th: The Jilin Provincial Party Committee recently held a meeting of prefectural, municipal, and county party secretaries to earnestly convey and discuss the spirit of the Third Plenary Session. Combining this with the province's actual conditions, the meeting specifically deployed the work for deeply carrying out socialist education in the countryside this winter and next spring, and for launching a production upsurge with vigorously building farmland water conservancy, carrying out a manure accumulation campaign, and strengthening livestock breeding management and the reproduction of draught animals as its main content, to strive to complete and overfulfill the task of producing six million tons of grain throughout the province next year.

During the meeting, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, the province's grain work and the experiences and lessons of the socialist debate in the countryside were reviewed and summarized. After discussion, the meeting clarified the various policies and tasks for rural work this winter and next spring. Discussions in group meetings and plenary sessions showed that the socialist debate in the countryside is the best way to correctly handle contradictions among the people and the best method to fully promote democracy and follow the mass line. Many problems that were previously difficult to solve have been resolved through the great debate. Many people who previously had muddled ideas have clarified major issues of right and wrong through the great debate and strengthened their confidence in taking the socialist road. Many grassroots cadres who previously suffered from a lack of methods have learned working methods through the great debate and strengthened their work confidence. Unhealthy trends and evil practices in the countryside have also been attacked, and righteousness has begun to rise. This situation provides a reliable guarantee for doing a good job in rural work this winter and next spring.

In order to seize this favorable situation and expand the achievements in the countryside, the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, proposed that this winter and next spring, in conjunction with the socialist debate in the countryside, agricultural cooperatives and grassroots party organizations should be further rectified, consolidated, and improved. Based on the central government's three detailed instructions on improving the work of agricultural cooperatives and the problems existing in the province's agricultural cooperatives, the focus should be on the following four aspects: First, rectify the work style of cadres and improve leadership levels. Criticize the illegal and undisciplined behavior and seriously capitalist ideological behavior of a few cadres, and establish the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants. Second, rectify the organizations of cooperatives and teams. Currently, there are sixty-one large cooperatives with more than one thousand households and four hundred cooperatives with more than five hundred households in the province. Two years of production have proven that, except for a small number that have been run well, most large cooperatives have not been run well and their management is chaotic. Therefore, according to the current demands of the masses, large cooperatives should be divided into smaller ones, and production teams should generally be around twenty households. Third, implement the mutually beneficial policy of overall planning and each getting what they deserve. Through reasonable division of labor in production and reasonable distribution, properly regulate the income problems between members, especially between poor peasants and middle peasants. For members whose income is reduced, each household should be studied and appropriately arranged to give play to the role of all labor forces. And we must always pay attention to resolving the contradictions between the collective interests and individual interests of agricultural cooperatives. Fourth, improve the production management of agricultural cooperatives. In order to give play to the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, it is necessary to establish a system of "unified management and hierarchical management" under the premise of consolidating unified leadership and developing production. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent decentralism and departmentalism, and also to delineate the responsibilities and authority of cooperatives and teams, so as to achieve division of labor and mutual cooperation between the upper and lower levels. And it is necessary to further promote the "three guarantees" and overproduction reward system.

In order to develop production and for the production level of agricultural cooperatives to catch up with and surpass the level of wealthy middle peasants within five years, the Jilin Provincial Party Committee proposed that on the basis of appropriately increasing the income of members, public accumulation should be increased year by year to continuously expand reproduction. Under the premise of ensuring that the income of more than 80% of the members increases, the public accumulation fund of agricultural cooperatives can be increased to more than 10%. And it is required that the province, prefecture, and county levels strive to do a good job in planning for ten years of production this winter and next spring. Agricultural cooperatives must make ten-year plans by the end of next year.

In order to immediately launch a production upsurge through the socialist debate in the countryside, the meeting especially emphasized criticizing the various erroneous ideas and conservative sentiments among rural cadres, overcoming the mentality of holding back, affirming past achievements, summarizing lessons, fully mobilizing the masses, vigorously carrying out agricultural capital construction work, and increasing the yield per unit area.

    吉林省委召开地、市、县委书记会议
    传达三中全会精神布置农村工作
    本报长春28日电　记者汤宝顺报道：中共吉林省委最近召开地、市、县委书记会议，认真传达、讨论了三中全会的精神，并且结合本省实际情况，具体地布置了今冬明春在农村深入开展社会主义教育，掀起以大力兴修农田水利、开展积肥运动和加强牲畜饲养管理与繁殖耕畜等为内容的生产高潮，以争取完成和超额完成明年全省生产六百万吨粮食的任务。
    会议期间，根据三中全会的精神，检查总结了全省的粮食工作和农村中社会主义大辩论的经验教训，经过讨论，明确了今冬明春农村工作各项方针、任务。在小组会和大会的讨论表明：农村中的社会主义大辩论，是正确处理人民内部矛盾的最好形式，是充分发扬民主、走群众路线的最好方法。过去有许多不好解决的问题，通过大辩论解决了；过去有许多人存在糊涂观念，经过大辩论以后明确了大是大非，坚定了走社会主义道路的信心，过去有许多基层干部苦于缺少办法，经过大辩论以后，学到了工作方法，坚定了工作信心。农村中的歪风邪气也遭到了打击，正气开始上升。这种情况使做好今冬明春农村工作有了可靠的保证。
    为抓住这一有利形势，扩大农村中的战果，中共吉林省委根据三中全会的精神提出：今冬明春结合农村中的社会主义大辩论，进一步整顿巩固提高农业社和党的基层组织。根据中央关于改进农业社工作的三项详细指示和本省农业社存在的问题，着重从如下四方面进行：一、整顿干部的工作作风，提高领导水平。批判少数干部的违法乱纪和有严重资本主义的思想行为，树立贫农和下中农的领导优势。二、整顿社与队的组织。现在全省一千户以上的大社有六十一个，五百户以上的四百来个。两年来的生产证明，其中除一小部分办的较好，多数大社没办好，经营管理混乱。因此，应根据当前群众的要求，把大社划小，生产队一般应以二十户左右为适宜。三、贯彻执行统筹安排，各得其所的互利政策。经过合理的生产分工和合理的分配，恰当地调节社员之间，特别是贫农和中农之间的收入问题。对减少收入的社员，应逐户研究、适当安排，发挥所有劳动力的作用。并要经常注意解决农业社的集体利益与个人利益之间的矛盾。四、改进农业社的生产管理。为发挥农业社的优越性，必须在有利于巩固统一领导，发展生产的前提下，建立“统一经营，分级管理”的制度。同时要防止分散主义、本位主义，也要划清社与队的职责、权限，做到上下分工，互相配合。并且要进一步推行“三包”和超产奖励制度。
    为了发展生产，在五年内农业社的生产水平赶上和超过富裕中农水平，中共吉林省委提出要在适当增加社员收入的基础上，逐年增加公共积累，不断扩大再生产。在保证80％以上的社员增加收入的前提下，农业社的公积金可提高到10％以上。并且要求省、地、县三级争取在今冬明春做好十年生产的规划。到明年年底以前农业社都要作出十年的规划。
    为了通过农村中的社会主义大辩论，立即掀起一个生产高潮，会议特别强调了批判目前农村干部中的各种错误思想和保守情绪，克服缩手缩脚的思想方法，肯定过去的成绩，总结教训，充分发动群众，大力开展农业基本建设工作，提高单位面积产量。
