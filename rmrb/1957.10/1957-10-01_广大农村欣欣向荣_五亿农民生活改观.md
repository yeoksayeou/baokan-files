Five years ago, only 0.2% of China's peasants had joined agricultural production cooperatives (elementary cooperatives); now, over 90% of the total number of peasant households in the country have joined advanced agricultural production cooperatives. In recent years, with each step forward in the cooperative movement, the face of China's vast countryside and the lives of 500 million peasants have been constantly changing. In 1952, the total grain output of the country was 308.8 billion jin; in 1956, it had increased to 365 billion jin. In 1952, the total cotton output of the country was 26.07 million dan; in 1956, it had increased to 28.9 million dan. It is expected that the total output of grain and cotton this year will increase compared to last year. By the end of June this year, more than 114 million pigs had been raised across the country, exceeding the highest level in history. By the end of July this year, the irrigated area across the country had reached more than 520 million mu, an increase of 210 million mu compared to the irrigated area developed from the beginning of history to 1952. The total output value of various sideline occupations is also constantly increasing. Whether in the south or the north, the plains or the mountains, the coast or the interior, the vast countryside is a scene of prosperity.

Now, many agricultural cooperatives in various places are busy with autumn harvesting and planting, while also carrying out rectification and cooperative consolidation movements, and actively preparing to formulate production plans for next year and the long term. The vast majority of cooperative members are full of confidence in a better future.

Here is an introduction to the situation of Baiyangyu Village, a common village in the Taihang Mountains, in Xiyang County.

This is a small mountain village surrounded by layers of mountains, with many stones and thin soil, and very poor natural conditions. People call it "Bald Mountain" and "Poor Gully." Before liberation, no one wanted to live here and everyone was preparing to move down the mountain. The originally impoverished peasants suffered another devastating sweep by the Japanese invaders, and the whole village was even more destitute.

Under the leadership of the Baiyangyu Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, they organized to engage in production. After years of hard struggle, the peasants here have now escaped poverty. One hundred and four households have formed an advanced agricultural cooperative, with comprehensive development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. The people of Baiyangyu Village have composed a folk song to boast about their good life today: "Making a home by planting forests, developing all six domestic animals (cattle, sheep, horses, donkeys, mules, pigs), doubling the yield per mu, greatly improving our lives."

Baiyangyu Village is located on this mountainside.

In less than two years last year and this year, twenty-four girls have found their way to the mountain and married the young men of Baiyangyu. Old Granny Wang, seventy-two years old (third from the left), often visits the newly married Mao Aiwen (first from the left) at her home. She envies these young girls for having such happy families and cannot help but recall how her family of four had no quilts in those days and spent the winter covering themselves with only a grain sack.

The mountain gully that used to have no mules or horses now has more than twenty.

Baiyangyu Village has newly built one hundred and twenty-nine brick houses in the past two years.

"Bald Mountain raises a money tree," the May 2nd Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative now has 8,000 fruit trees of various kinds.

The saplings planted ten years ago have now matured. This is a large amount of timber felled from the mountain.

    广大农村欣欣向荣  五亿农民生活改观
    五年以前，我国农民加入农业生产合作社（初级社）的只不过0.2％；现在，只是加入高级农业生产合作社的就占全国总农户的90％以上了。这几年，随着合作化运动的每一步进展，我国广大农村的面貌和五亿农民的生活都在不断地发生变化。1952年，全国粮食的总产量是三千零八十八亿斤；1956年已经增长到三千六百五十亿斤。1952年，全国棉花的总产量是二千六百零七万担；1956年已经增长到二千八百九十万担。预计今年粮食和棉花的总产量都可以比去年有所增加。到今年6月底，全国各地所养的猪已经达到一亿一千四百多万头，超过了历史上的最高水平。到今年7月底，全国各地的灌溉面积已经达到五亿二千多万亩，比有史以来到1952年为止开辟的灌溉面积增加二亿一千万亩。各种副业的总产值也在不断增加。无论南方和北方，平原或山区，沿海和内地，广大农村都是一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    现在，各地许多农业社正在一面忙着秋收秋种，一面开展整风和整社运动，一面积极准备制订明年的和长远的生产规划。绝大多数社员对于未来的更加美好的生活充满了信心。
    这里介绍的是太行山区一个普通的村庄——昔阳县白羊峪村的情形。
    这是一个被重重叠叠大山围绕着的小山庄，石多土薄，自然条件很坏，人们称它“秃山”、“穷沟”。解放前，谁也不愿意住在这里，都准备搬下山去。原来已经很贫困的农民，又遭受到日本侵略者的大扫荡，全村更是一贫如洗了。
    在中共白羊峪村支部领导下，组织起来搞生产。经过多年艰苦奋斗，现在这里的农民已经摆脱了贫困，一百零四户人家组成了高级农业社，农业、林业、牧业、副业全面发展。白羊峪村的人编出了一首歌谣，夸耀他们今天美好的生活：“造林起家园，六畜（牛、羊、马、驴、骡、猪）齐发展，亩产翻一翻，生活大改善。”（附图片）
    白羊峪村就在这座山腰间。
    去年和今年不到两年的时间，就有二十四个姑娘找上了山，和白羊峪的小伙子结了婚。七十二岁王老大娘（左三）常到新婚的毛爱文（左一）家里做客，她羡慕这些年轻姑娘们有这种幸福家庭，不由得想起她当年一家四口没有被盖，仅盖一条粮口袋过冬的情景。
    过去没有一匹骡马的山沟，现在已有骡马二十多匹。
    白羊峪村近二年来新盖了一百二十九间砖瓦房。
    “秃山养起摇钱树”，五二先锋农业社现在已有各种果树八千株。
    十年前种的树苗，现在已成材了。这是从山上伐下的大批木材。
