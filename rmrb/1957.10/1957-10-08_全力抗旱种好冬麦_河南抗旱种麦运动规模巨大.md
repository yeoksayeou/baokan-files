Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, October 5th: A massive drought resistance and wheat planting campaign is underway in the rural areas of Henan Province. More than ten million farmers across the province are working in the fields every day to combat drought and plant wheat.

This province, the largest wheat producer in the country, plans to sow over 80 million mu this year, of which 50 million mu are suffering from drought and lack of moisture, with 25 million mu lacking water sources.

Under the leadership and encouragement of Party committees at all levels, the drought resistance and wheat planting campaign has been launched throughout the province. According to incomplete statistics from eight special districts, as of September 30th, 21.89 million mu of wheat had been sown and over 5 million mu of land had been irrigated.

The great achievements made in water conservancy construction in Henan Province in recent years have brought very favorable conditions to this year's drought resistance and wheat planting campaign. The province now has 1.5 million wells, with an irrigation capacity of 25 million mu; more than 320,000 ponds and dams, capable of irrigating 8 million mu; 56,000 large and small canals, capable of irrigating 6 million mu; and 2,300 small reservoirs, capable of irrigating over 1 million mu. In areas with poor water conservancy conditions and insufficient water sources, a water conservancy construction movement to open up new water sources has been launched.

    全力抗旱种好冬麦
    河南抗旱种麦运动规模巨大
    据新华社郑州5日电　河南省农村正在展开一个规模巨大的抗旱种麦运动。全省每天在田野里抗旱种麦的农民在一千万人以上。
    这个全国产麦最多的省份，今年计划播种的八千多万亩中，有五千万亩干旱缺墒，其中还有二千五百万亩缺乏水源。
    在各级党委的领导和鼓舞下，抗旱种麦运动已在全省展开。据八个专区的不完全统计，到9月30日止，已种上小麦二千一百八十九万亩，浇地五百多万亩。
    河南省近几年里在水利建设上所取得的伟大成就，给今年的抗旱种麦运动带来了很有利的条件。全省现有水井一百五十万眼、灌溉能力为两千五百万亩；塘堰坝三十二万多处，能浇地八百万亩；大小渠道五万六千条，可浇地六百万亩；小水库二千三百座，可浇地一百多万亩。在水利条件差和水源不足的地方，展开了开辟新水源的水利建设运动。
