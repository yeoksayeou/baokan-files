    Organs of the Lüda People's Committee
    Transition to the Stage of Rectification and Improvement

    (Our dispatch) Following the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, most units under the Lüda Municipal People's Committee have begun to transition to the stage of "Big Blooming and Big Letting" focused on improving work and rectifying organizational structures. Vice Mayor Li Dongchao delivered a mobilization report at a cadre meeting of directly subordinate organs. Currently, many organs in Lüda are engaging in mass discussions on reforming organizational structures. The Lüda Municipal Bureau of Industry focused its "Big Blooming and Big Letting" on issues such as organizational setup, scope of responsibilities, and decentralization of authority. Initial discussions among the masses suggest that the bureau's cadres could be reduced by more than one-third, and the number of sections could be reduced from twenty to fourteen. During the "Blooming and Letting," many sincere criticisms were raised regarding the overly detailed organizational setup and excessive personnel. For example, cadres in the Supply Section and Sales Section pointed out that separating supply and sales into two sections not only led to frequent collisions in work, wasting a lot of manpower, but also often created contradictions. After debate, it was unanimously agreed that they could be merged into one section, which would save manpower and improve work efficiency. The common task of personnel and education is to educate and cultivate cadres, but in the past, the Personnel Section only managed usage, while the Education Section specialized in training, resulting in frequent disconnections between usage and training. Merging them into one section would not only overcome the disconnection but also save six personnel. After mass discussion, the bureau has proposed a preliminary plan for reforming the organizational structure, deciding to supplement the grassroots factories and mines, industrial schools, and agricultural production with the cadres streamlined this time. Other units are also engaged in enthusiastic "Blooming and Letting."

    旅大人民委员会各机关
    转入边整边改阶段
    本报讯　旅大市人民委员会所属机关在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，大部单位开始转入以改进工作为中心，以整顿组织机构为内容的大鸣大放阶段。在直属机关的干部大会上，李东潮副市长作了动员报告。现在旅大市许多机关已展开了群众性的改革组织机构的讨论。旅大市工业局在大鸣大放中较集中讨论了机构设置、职责范围、职权下放等方面的问题。经群众初步讨论结果，全局干部可减少三分之一以上，二十个科室可减至十四个。鸣放中大家对机构设置过细，人员过多的现象提出了不少中肯的批评。如供应科和销售科干部在讨论中，提出由于供销分置两科，不仅在工作中碰头很多，浪费了很多人力，而且还经常制造矛盾。经过辩论一致意见可并为一个科，既省人力，又提高工作效率。人事和教育的共同任务都是教育与培养干部，可是过去人事科光管使用，教育科专管培训，结果使用与培训经常脱节。并为一个科不仅可克服脱节现象，而且还能节省六个人力。经过群众讨论后该局已提出改革组织机构的初步方案，决定将此次精简下来的干部充实基层厂矿、工业学校和参加工农业生产。其他各单位也正在展开热烈的鸣放。
