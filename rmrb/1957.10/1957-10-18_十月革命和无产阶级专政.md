　　The October Revolution and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat
　　Wang Huide
　　Forty years ago, the October Revolution in Russia was the greatest revolution in human history. For thousands of years, the world has seen countless revolutions, but all these revolutions have merely replaced the rulers of society from one exploiting class to another, always the rule of exploiters over the exploited. In 1871, the Paris Commune in France made a heroic attempt to overthrow the capitalist exploitation system, but after seventy-two days, it was bloodily suppressed. Only the October Revolution forever declared the death of the exploitation system, replacing the rule of the exploiting class with the rule of the exploited class. Therefore, the October Revolution became the turning point in the development of human history, from thousands of years of various exploitative societies to a society without exploitation. Marx once believed that all societies before socialist society were merely developmental stages before human history, and only socialist society truly unveiled the real history of human society. And the October Revolution was precisely the starting point of this history.
　　Marx wrote in "Critique of the Gotha Program": "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat." This is Marx's most valuable idea for realizing this transformation in human history, and it is Marx's basic summary of the entire experience of the proletarian liberation movement in the past. In the era of the Second International's opportunist rule, Marx's idea was completely buried. Only Lenin and the Bolshevik Party fought resolutely against the opportunists of the Second International, adhered to Marx's idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and turned it into reality. In 1919, Lenin, in his article "The Third International and Its Place in History," elaborated on the path of the dictatorship of the proletariat opened up by the October Revolution in the development of human history, stating: "The world-historical significance of the Third International, the Communist International, lies in the fact that it has begun to give effect to Marx’s cardinal slogan, the slogan that sums up the century of development of socialism and the working-class movement and expresses it in the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat." For forty years, the Soviet Union, holding high the banner of the dictatorship of the proletariat, completely eliminated capitalism and all pre-capitalist exploitation systems, eliminated any socio-economic roots that could generate the phenomenon of human exploitation, completely built a socialist society, and gradually advanced toward communist society, victoriously realizing the transition from a society of human exploitation to a society without any exploitation. In this way, the Soviet Union, with its brilliant historical achievements, pointed out to all oppressed and exploited working people around the world: the dictatorship of the proletariat is the only path for people to transition from capitalist society to communist society.
　　I
　　The October Revolution created the world's first experience in entering the transition period from capitalism to communism. The Soviet Union, with its extremely complex and serious class struggle during its transition period, pointed out to all socialist revolutionaries the inestimable importance of adhering to the dictatorship of the proletariat. It pointed out that whether or not to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat is the key to the success or failure of the entire socialist cause. Only by adhering to the dictatorship of the proletariat is it possible to completely eliminate the capitalist exploitation system and fully build a socialist society; without the dictatorship of the proletariat, or with the slightest wavering in the dictatorship of the proletariat, there will be no socialist society. It will inevitably lead to the restoration of capitalism.
　　The "revolutionary transformation period" from capitalism to communism is a period of great social changes, a period in which society undergoes tremendous changes in the economic, political, and ideological aspects. The bourgeoisie's regime is overthrown, and the laboring people, under the leadership of the proletariat, establish their own regime. Yesterday's slaves become today's masters of society. Capitalism and all pre-capitalist exploitation systems are destroyed, and a new socialist economic system is gradually established and developed. All these earth-shaking changes in society inevitably cause various, even completely opposite, reactions among the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, and the proletariat, and among all different classes, strata, social groups, social forces, and individuals. Some are heartbroken, hostile, resentful, and carry out various resistance and sabotage activities; some are hesitant, wavering, and unaccustomed to the new life; and some are jubilant, in favor of, supportive, and fight resolutely for the new life at the risk of their lives. All these different attitudes, positions, and actions among people show that in the society of the transition period, there are still profound and complex class struggles, serious struggles in the economic, political, and ideological fields.
　　The most basic class struggle in the society of the transition period is the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the struggle between capitalist forces and socialist forces, the struggle between the tendency of capitalist restoration and the tendency of building socialism, in short, the struggle between "capitalism which has been defeated, but not yet eliminated, and communism which has been born, but is still very fragile," as Lenin pointed out in his article "Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." Certain members of the exploiting classes who are overthrown, deprived, and attacked in the socialist revolution often never resign themselves to failure, do not want to think about failure, and always carry out desperate and resolute resistance with ten times the effort and a hundred times the hatred, in order to restore the "paradise" they have lost and to realize the restoration of capitalism. On the other hand, the bourgeoisie is bound to use its thousands of social connections and various selfish social traditions and habits formed by thousands of years of private ownership to influence, erode, and surround petty-bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, develop their spontaneity and licentiousness, and carry out activities from all aspects that are sufficient to cause capitalist restoration. Lenin particularly pointed out that Russia is a country with a large number of petty-bourgeois, and the spontaneous activities of millions of petty-bourgeois elements tenfold increased the strength of capitalist restoration, thus making the class struggle in the transition period particularly complex and serious. Under such circumstances, if the proletariat wants to defeat capitalism, to win the complete victory of socialism, and to fully realize the revolutionary transformation from capitalism to communism, there is no other way but to thoroughly implement what Marx and Engels instructed in the "Communist Manifesto": to organize itself into a ruling class. In other words, the dictatorship of the proletariat must be implemented.
　　The so-called dictatorship of the proletariat means that the proletariat exercises political rule over society, or in other words, exercises state leadership over society. Here, the proletariat does not share political power with any other class. Lenin said that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the political power of "one" class, and this class must grasp "all" of the new state apparatus. ("The Tasks of the Third International") He also said: "The term dictatorship of the proletariat has meaning only when one class knows that it alone takes political power into its hands and does not deceive itself or others with talk about popular, elected, sanctified power" ("Speech at the All-Russia Transport Workers' Congress"). This is because the proletariat needs state power for no other reason than to use it as a tool for its class struggle, as a weapon to implement its policies, lines, and realize its political goals. The state has always been a weapon for the ruling class to carry out class struggle, and the state in the transition period is no exception. With this weapon, the proletariat, on the one hand, uses it to severely suppress any resistance and sabotage activities of all exploiters and their lackeys, and on the other hand, uses it to unite, educate, and transform petty-bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, as Lenin said in his book "Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder," "under the dictatorship of the proletariat, to re-educate millions of peasants and small proprietors, hundreds of thousands of office employees, officials and bourgeois intellectuals, to subordinate them all to the proletarian state and to proletarian leadership, to overcome their bourgeois habits and traditions"; at the same time, in this struggle, to re-educate the proletarians themselves, because the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois habits that the proletarians have contracted in the old society cannot be quickly eliminated, and can only be eliminated in the long-term struggle against the influence of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, the dictatorship of the proletariat is an arduous and long-term process of class struggle, "is a persistent struggle, bloody and bloodless, violent and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative, against the forces and traditions of the old society." (Ibid.)
　　Some petty-bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, often out of class prejudice, are disgusted with class struggle, fantasize about escaping class struggle, and are unwilling to accept the political rule of the proletariat, always wanting to get rid of this rule and find a third way between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, that is, a middle road. However, this is not feasible. The entire political economy of Marxism points out that in capitalist society, due to the economic structure of this society itself, there are only two classes that can play a decisive role: either the bourgeoisie or the proletariat. The bourgeoisie is the builder, leader, and promoter of capitalist society; the proletariat is the gravedigger of this society and the only force capable of replacing the bourgeoisie. The petty bourgeoisie, on the one hand, has inextricably linked ties with the capitalist economy in terms of private ownership, and on the other hand, is in a process of constant disintegration. Therefore, in the class struggle, only the proletariat can lead the masses to oppose the bourgeoisie; only the proletariat can overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie. In the transition period, there is only one class that can eliminate any economic roots that can generate capitalist rule, and can completely liberate the masses from the rule of capital, and that is the proletariat. This class "has been educated, united, trained and steeled in decades of strike and political struggles against capital; it has assimilated all the culture of the cities, of industry, of large-scale capitalism, and has the determination and ability to defend it, to preserve it, to develop it further, and to make it accessible to all the people, to all working people; it can withstand all the hardships, trials, privations and great sacrifices which history inevitably inflicts on those who break with the past and boldly hew a road for themselves to a new future; its finest representatives are filled with hatred and contempt for everything petty-bourgeois and philistine, for those qualities which flourish so profusely among the petty bourgeoisie, the office employees and the ‘intellectuals’; it has been steeled by labour and has learned to respect the labour of every working man and woman.” (Lenin: "Letter to the Workers of Hungary") Only the dictatorship of such a class can prevent the restoration of the bourgeoisie and the resurgence of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Once one departs from the dictatorship of this class, it will inevitably lead to the restoration of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the question can only be: either the dictatorship of the proletariat or the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and there is no middle road. Those petty-bourgeois elements who want to avoid the dictatorship of the proletariat and at the same time want to escape the rule of capital and the rule of the bourgeoisie are simply daydreaming. Lenin said: "Only titled gentlemen and badly-educated intellectuals can allow themselves to dream of a middle road. Nowhere in the world has there ever been a middle road, nor can there be. Either the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (masked by ornate SRS and Menshevik talk about a people’s government, a constituent assembly, liberty, and so forth), or the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whoever has failed to learn this from the history of the entire nineteenth century is an incorrigible idiot." ("Letter to Workers and Peasants Apropos of the Victory Over Kolchak")
　　In fact, in the transition period, the so-called middle road is to pave the way for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, that is, the restoration of capitalism. The transition period is nothing but a period of sharp struggle between socialist forces and capitalist forces. Any effort to get rid of or shake the dictatorship of the proletariat can only serve the bourgeoisie in this struggle, and can only help the bourgeoisie to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat. Petty-bourgeois elements and intellectuals themselves cannot become an independent social force in any society. They either depend on the proletariat or on the bourgeoisie. If they want to get rid of the proletariat, they will inevitably turn to the bourgeoisie. The activities of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks during the October Revolution and the Civil War in the Soviet Union, and the rebellion launched by the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists in Kronstadt in 1921, all accurately prove Lenin's assertion: "Petty-bourgeois democrats are incapable of holding power; their role at all times is only either to cover up the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, or to serve as a stepping stone for the bourgeoisie to obtain dictatorship." ("Draft Theses on Tactics for the Third Congress of the Communist International")
　　As mentioned above, in the transition period, it is either the dictatorship of the proletariat or the restoration of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Since the question is posed so sharply and ruthlessly, the proletariat who has seized power must resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries who carry out resistance and sabotage activities, and must not be weak in the slightest. It is precisely on this issue that some petty-bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals appear particularly foolish and reactionary. They wholeheartedly yearn for supra-class "humanity," "human nature," "benevolence," and "benevolent government," and are disgusted with and opposed to violence. They do not understand at all that the state has always been a tool or machine for one class to exercise violence against another class, and has never been a "benevolent" thing. It is either the vast number of working people exercising a severe dictatorship over a small number of enemies, or a small number of enemies carrying out bloody suppression of the vast number of working people. What is being carried out here is a life-and-death struggle, and there is no room for reconciliation. Counter-revolutionaries are stubborn and ruthless in their resistance and sabotage of the socialist cause. In order to defend the achievements of the socialist revolution and protect the freedom and happiness of the broadest masses of working people, the proletariat must resolutely suppress any counter-revolutionaries who carry out resistance and sabotage activities. Any weakness or hesitation in this struggle will inevitably be to condone the enemy, and will ultimately lead to the restoration of the counter-revolution, causing millions of working people to pay a heavy price in blood for this weakness. Therefore, only by resolutely implementing a strict dictatorship can the proletariat and the proletarian party not fail its leading position, and be the true leader of millions of working people. Lenin said: "Dictatorship is a stern, harsh, bloody, and painful word, and such words should not be used lightly." ("Deception of the People with Slogans of Freedom and Equality") This is what he meant.
　　In short, the Soviet Union's transition period opened up by the October Revolution shows us with all the complexity of its class struggle: the dictatorship of the proletariat is one of the most fundamental issues in socialist construction. The proletariat's political rule over society is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of socialist construction and the complete elimination of the exploitation system, and the unshakable cornerstone of the socialist system. All those who support socialism and are willing to work hard for building a socialist society and eliminating the capitalist exploitation system must not have the slightest hesitation or wavering on this issue.
　　II
　　The October Revolution was the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat over the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and at the same time, it was the victory of proletarian democracy over bourgeois democracy. For hundreds of years, the so-called democracy in capitalist countries has only been democracy that a few exploiters and oppressors can enjoy, while the October Revolution, for the first time, gave democracy to the vast exploited and oppressed working people, making the true masters of society, the working people, have the political rights to decide their own destiny for the first time in history. Therefore, the October Revolution declared the complete bankruptcy of bourgeois democracy and replaced it with the highest type of democracy possible before classes are eliminated, true democracy, proletarian democracy.
　　All those who support capitalism and oppose socialism, from the opportunists of the Second International, right-wing social democrats, and traitors like Kautsky, to those imperialist bourgeois elements, for decades, almost without exception, have attacked socialist countries for not having democracy, and only capitalist countries have democracy. They shamelessly boast that capitalist countries are "democratic countries," and maliciously declare socialist countries to be "totalitarian countries." In fact, nothing is more absurd and shameless than this attack. They talk emptily about "democracy" and "totalitarianism," but dare not raise the class content of democracy, and dare not point out which "class" has democracy and which "class" does not have democracy in capitalist countries and socialist countries. This kind of vague and abstract way of raising questions only shows that they deliberately conceal the bourgeois nature of democracy in capitalist countries, disguise the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie as "general democracy," and use it to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, proletarian democracy.
　　Democracy in social life belongs to the political realm, and politics is the relationship and struggle between classes, that is, the struggle between various classes for the domination of society. Therefore, in class society, democracy has class character: it is either the democracy of this class or the democracy of that class. There has never been a "national" or "general" democracy. In all capitalist countries, so-called democratic rights, due to various legal and practical living conditions, are always only enjoyed by the bourgeoisie and the rich, while the vast proletariat and other working people are actually unable to enjoy them. And these restrictions are all shifted in favor of the bourgeoisie, all in order to guarantee the "social order" of the bourgeoisie's exploitation and oppression of the proletariat, in order to guarantee that the proletariat cannot use these "democratic rights" to shake the rule of the bourgeoisie. Lenin put it well: "Democracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the rich—that is what capitalist democracy amounts to. If we look more closely into the machinery of capitalist democracy, we see everywhere, in the ‘petty’—supposedly petty—details of the suffrage (residential qualification, exclusion of women, and so forth), in the technique of the representative institutions, in the actual obstacles to the right of assembly (public buildings are not for ‘paupers’!), in the purely capitalist organisation of the daily press, etc., etc.,—we see restriction after restriction upon democracy. These restrictions, exceptions, exclusions, obstacles for the poor seem slight, especially in the eyes of one who has never known want himself and has never been in close contact with the life of the masses, and nine-tenths, if not ninety-nine hundredths, of the bourgeois publicists and politicians come under this category!—but in their sum total these restrictions exclude and squeeze out the poor from politics, from active participation in democracy." ("State and Revolution")
　　In fact, in all capitalist countries, even in the most "democratic" capitalist countries, the "democratic rights" that the bourgeoisie allows the proletariat and other working people are often only related to non-major points, only related to the aspects that are least important and least obstructive to the rule of the bourgeoisie. As long as it slightly involves class relations, involves the relationship between ruler and ruled, involves "the oppressed class ‘destroying’ its own state of slavery and attempting to force its way forward to liberty in a human fashion." ("The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky"), that is, when it involves real democratic rights—the political rights of the working people to decide their own destiny—all the "democratic rights" that are verbally promised to the working people will immediately vanish, and the true face of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie will immediately be nakedly revealed. It is precisely at this point that the extreme hypocrisy of the bourgeois democratic system is shown, that the so-called bourgeois democracy "cannot but be democracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the rich. He who does not see this truth must not come within range of a discussion on socialism. Democracy for the rich is a trap and a swindle for the poor.” (Ibid.), and that the "democratic rights" that the proletariat and other working people can obtain under the capitalist system, as Marx said, are actually only to allow them to solve this problem once every few years: to choose from the oppressing class who will be the representatives of this class to oppress and suppress the working people. That is all.
　　Therefore, bourgeois democracy is the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, that is, the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie disguised as "national" or "general" democracy. Here, there are no real democratic rights for the proletariat and other working people.
　　In contrast to capitalist countries, socialist countries never verbally promise any "national" or "general" democracy, and always openly declare that proletarian democracy is the dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, democracy is only for a part of the people, while dictatorship is for another part of the people. In class society, the democratic rights of one class inevitably exclude the democratic rights of another class that is hostile to it. Where the bourgeoisie has democracy, there is no democracy for the proletariat, and where the proletariat has democracy, there is no democracy for the bourgeois reactionaries. Therefore, as long as there is still class struggle, as long as there is still antagonism between hostile classes, the proletariat that has seized power must resolutely suppress all classes, social groups, and social forces that resist its rule. Only in this way can the democratic rights of the proletariat and other working people be maintained and guaranteed.
　　Socialist countries carry out severe suppression of the enemies who account for a very small percentage of the population, while carrying out the broadest democracy imaginable in capitalist countries for the working people who account for the largest percentage of the population. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the dictatorship of the largest number of people over the smallest number of people in history, that is, the dictatorship of the broadest masses of working people over the smallest number of exploiters and oppressors. The nature of this regime itself determines that all its strength and authority cannot rely on anything else but on maximizing the revolutionary enthusiasm and consciousness of the broadest masses of working people. Therefore, implementing the broadest democracy for the working people and maintaining the closest ties with the working people are the fundamental conditions for the proletarian regime to persist in the long-term and arduous struggle against all internal and external enemies. When Lenin was debating with Menshevik elements in 1906, he made an excellent statement about the democratic nature of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is completely different from the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. He said, "What does this force (i.e., revolutionary dictatorship—translator's note) rely on? It relies on the masses of the people. This is the fundamental difference between this new regime and all the old regimes in the past. Those were regimes in which a minority ruled the people, ruled the workers and peasants, while this is a regime in which the people, i.e., the workers and peasants, rule the minority, rule a handful of police-like thugs, rule a handful of privileged aristocrats and bureaucrats. This is the difference between the dictatorship over the people and the dictatorship of the revolutionary people... The old regime of the dictatorship of the minority was able to maintain itself purely by relying on police-like conspiracies and tricks, purely by excluding and ostracizing the people, preventing them from participating in the regime and monitoring the regime. The old regime consistently distrusted the masses, feared the light, and maintained its position by means of deception. The new regime of the dictatorship of the vast majority of people has been able to maintain itself and has maintained itself purely by relying on the trust of the broadest masses, purely because it can most freely, most widely, and most powerfully attract all the masses to participate in the regime." ("The Victory of the Constitutional Democrats and the Tasks of the Workers' Party")
　　The Soviet Union after the October Revolution, with its entire history, has shown the democratic nature of the dictatorship of the proletariat, showing that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the most democratic regime for the people. Under this regime, the working people enjoy the broadest and freest rights to decide their own destiny and create their own new life that they have never been able to obtain under the rule of the exploiting classes. This is true democracy that is essentially completely different from bourgeois democracy, this is the highest type of democracy that is a million times more democratic than bourgeois democracy.
　　Some petty-bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals cannot see the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie on the issue of democracy, prostrate themselves at the feet of the form of bourgeois democracy, regard the deceptive tricks of the bourgeoisie as the standard of true democracy, despise or intentionally despise the unprecedented democratic rights obtained by the working people under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and do not believe that whether the working people, who account for the vast majority of the population and are the true masters of society, have the right to decide their own destiny is the most important standard of true and false democracy, and actually declare that socialist countries are not democratic and only capitalist countries are "democratic." This can only show that they do not share the same breath and destiny with the working people, and can only show that they are compatible with the imperialist bourgeoisie. Lenin was right: "Proletarian democracy is a million times more democratic than any bourgeois democracy; Soviet power is a million times more democratic than the most democratic bourgeois republic. Only someone who is a conscious lackey of the bourgeoisie, or someone who is politically dead, someone who does not see real life from behind the dust of bourgeois books, someone who is therefore objectively an accomplice of the bourgeoisie, can fail to see this. Only someone who is incapable of putting the question from the point of view of the oppressed classes can fail to see this." ("The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky")
　　Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the working people enjoy the broadest and fullest democratic rights. However, the proletariat is not an absolute democrat. It never regards democracy as the goal of its struggle, but only regards democracy as a means to serve its cause of liberation and as a means to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialist construction. The proletarian democratic system is democratic centralism, that is to say, this democracy is democracy under centralized guidance, it is the unity of democracy and centralism. Through this democratic system, it is possible to fully mobilize and develop the revolutionary enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the broad masses of working people, and to concentrate this revolutionary enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity into
a unified will and a unified action, making them truly an effective force for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and promoting socialist construction. On this point, proletarian democracy has nothing in common with anarchism and absolute democracy. Anarchist tendencies and absolute democratic tendencies are not tendencies of proletarian democracy, but tendencies of petty-bourgeois democracy, which are the political manifestations of petty-bourgeois spontaneity. Soviet history shows that in the transition period, petty-bourgeois spontaneity always manifests itself as a force that shakes the dictatorship of the proletariat for a long time and thousands of times. Therefore, in socialist countries, in order to defend and consolidate proletarian democracy, on the one hand, it is necessary to fight against those tendencies that worship and attempt to restore bourgeois democracy, that is, the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to fight against those petty-bourgeois anarchist tendencies, because this tendency is also opposed to proletarian democracy and ultimately leads to the restoration of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

　　十月革命和无产阶级专政
　　王惠德
    四十年以前，俄国发生的十月革命，是人类历史上最伟大的一次革命。几千年来，世界上不知道发生过多少次革命，但所有这些革命，都不过是使社会的统治者从一个剥削阶级换成另一个剥削阶级，始终是剥削者对被剥削者的统治。1871年法国的巴黎公社曾经作过推翻资本主义剥削制度的英勇尝试，但它存在了七十二天以后，被血腥地镇压下去了。只有十月革命，永远宣告了剥削制度的死亡，用被剥削阶级的统治来代替了剥削阶级的统治。因此，十月革命成了人类历史发展的转折点，从存在了几千年的各种人剥削人的社会到没有剥削的社会的转折点。马克思曾经认为，社会主义社会以前的一切社会，都不过只是人类历史以前的各个发展阶段，只有社会主义社会，才揭开了人类社会的真正历史。而十月革命，正是这个历史的起点。
    马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中写道：“在资本主义社会和共产主义社会之间，横着一个从前者进到后者的革命转变时期。同这个时期相适应的是一个政治上的过渡时期，这个时期的国家不能是别的任何东西，只能是无产阶级的革命专政。”这是马克思关于实现人类历史的这个转变所提出的最宝贵的思想，是马克思对于过去无产阶级谋求解放运动全部经验的基本总结。而在第二国际机会主义统治的时代，马克思的这个思想完全被埋没了。只有列宁和布尔什维克党，同第二国际机会主义者进行了坚决的斗争，坚持了马克思的无产阶级专政的思想，并且把它变成了现实。1919年，列宁在“第三国际及其在历史上的地位”一文中阐述十月革命在人类历史发展中所开辟的无产阶级专政的道路时，说道：“第三国际即共产国际的世界历史意义在于：它已开始实现马克思的一个最伟大的口号，这个口号总结了社会主义和工人运动百年来的发展，表现这个口号的概念就是无产阶级专政。”四十年来，苏联高举着无产阶级专政的旗帜，彻底消灭了资本主义的和资本主义以前的一切剥削制度，消除了任何足以产生人剥削人现象的社会经济根源，完全建成了社会主义社会并逐步进向共产主义社会，胜利地实现了从人剥削人的社会到没有任何剥削的社会的过渡。这样，苏联就以辉煌的历史成就向全世界一切被压迫被剥削的劳动人民指明了：无产阶级专政乃是人们从资本主义社会过渡到共产主义社会去的唯一道路。
　　一
    十月革命创造了世界上第一个进入从资本主义到共产主义的过渡时期的经验。苏联以它过渡时期极端复杂严重的阶级斗争，向世界上一切社会主义革命者指明了坚持无产阶级专政的无可估量的重要性，它指明了：是否实行无产阶级专政乃是全部社会主义事业成败的关键。坚持无产阶级专政，才有可能彻底消灭资本主义剥削制度和完全建成社会主义社会；而没有无产阶级专政，或者对于无产阶级专政有丝毫的动摇，都不会有任何社会主义社会。都必然要引导到资本主义的复辟。
    从资本主义进到共产主义的“革命转变时期”，是一个社会大变动的时期，是社会在经济、政治、思想各方面都发生巨大变革的时期。资产阶级的政权被推翻，劳动人民在无产阶级领导下建立起自己的政权，昨天的奴隶变成了今天社会的主人，资本主义的和资本主义以前的一切剥削制度被摧毁，新的社会主义经济制度逐步建立和发展。社会上发生的所有这些翻天覆地的变动，必然在资产阶级、小资产阶级、无产阶级中间，在所有不同的阶级、阶层、社会集团、社会势力和个人中间，引起各种不同的以至完全相反的反应。有的是痛心疾首，敌视、怀恨于心和进行各种反抗、破坏活动；有的是犹疑不决，动摇不定和对于新的生活不习惯；有的则是欢欣鼓舞，赞成、拥护并且奋不顾身地为新的生活而进行坚决的斗争。在人们中间所有这些不同的态度、立场和行动，就是表明在过渡时期的社会中，仍然存在着深刻的复杂的阶级斗争，存在着经济领域中的、政治领域中的、思想领域中的严重斗争。
    过渡时期社会中最基本的阶级斗争，是资产阶级同无产阶级的斗争，是资本主义势力同社会主义势力的斗争，是资本主义复辟倾向和建设社会主义倾向之间的斗争，总之，是那个“已被打败，但还没有被消灭的资本主义和已经诞生，但还非常脆弱的共产主义”之间的斗争，如像列宁在“无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治”一文中所指出的那样。在社会主义革命中被推翻、被剥夺、被打击的某些剥削阶级分子，往往总是不会甘心失败，不愿意想到失败，往往总要以十倍的努力、百倍的仇恨心来进行拼死的坚决的抵抗，以恢复已经失去的“天堂”，以实现资本主义的复辟。而在另一方面，资产阶级必然要利用自己的千百种社会联系、几千年私有制度所形成的各种自私的社会传统和习惯，来影响、侵蚀、包围小资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子，发展他们的自发性和放荡性，使他们从各方面来进行足以造成资本主义复辟的活动。列宁特别指出，俄国是小资产阶级众多的国度，千百万小资产阶级分子的自发活动十倍地增强了资产阶级复辟的力量，因而使过渡时期的阶级斗争特别复杂和严重。在这样的情形下，无产阶级如果要战胜资本主义，要争取社会主义的彻底胜利，要完全实现从资本主义到共产主义的革命转变，除了彻底执行马克思、恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中所指示的：把自己组织成为统治阶级以外，是没有别的出路的。换句话说，就是必须实行无产阶级专政。
    所谓无产阶级专政，就是无产阶级对社会实行政治统治，或者说，对社会实行国家领导。在这里，无产阶级是不同任何别的阶级分掌政权的。列宁说，无产阶级专政是“一个”阶级的政权，这个阶级要掌握“全部”新的国家机器。（“论第三国际的任务”）又说：“只有当一个阶级知道，只有它独自夺取政权，而不用妄说什么‘全民的、全民公选的、全民尊敬的’政权的空话来自欺欺人时，无产阶级专政这一概念才有意思”（“全俄运输工人代表大会上的演说”）。这是因为，无产阶级所以需要国家政权，没有别的原因，就是为了把它作为自己进行阶级斗争的工具，作为贯彻自己的方针、路线和实现自己政治目的的武器。国家，从来就是统治阶级用以进行阶级斗争的武器，过渡时期的国家也决不例外。无产阶级凭借这个武器，一方面用以严厉镇压一切剥削者及其走狗的任何反抗，破坏活动，一方面用以团结、教育和改造小资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子，即如列宁在“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”一书中所说的，“在无产阶级专政下，来重新教育千百万农民和小业主，数十万职员、官吏及资产阶级知识分子，使他们大家都服从无产阶级的国家和无产阶级的领导，战胜他们中间的资产阶级的习惯和传统”；同时也在这个斗争中来重新教育无产者自己，因为无产者在旧社会中所沾染的资产阶级、小资产阶级习气，不是可以很快消除，而只有在同资产阶级、小资产阶级的影响作长期斗争中才能消除的。因此，无产阶级专政是一个艰巨的长期的阶级斗争过程，“是为反对旧社会势力及其传统而进行的坚持的斗争，流血的与不流血的，强力的与和平的，军事的与经济的，教育的与行政的斗争。”（同上书）
    某些小资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子，往往出于阶级的偏见，厌恶阶级斗争，空想逃避阶级斗争，不愿意接受无产阶级的政治统治，总想摆脱这个统治而在无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政之间寻找第三条道路。即中间的道路。然而，这是行不通的。马克思主义全部政治经济学指明，在资本主义社会中，由于这个社会经济结构本身的原因，能够起决定作用的，只有两个阶级：或者是资产阶级，或者是无产阶级。资产阶级是资本主义社会的建设者，领导者，推动者；无产阶级则是这个社会的掘墓人，是唯一能够代替资产阶级的力量。而小资产阶级，既在私有制这点上同资本主义经济有千丝万缕的联系，又处于不断分化的过程中。因而在阶级斗争中，只有无产阶级，才能够领导群众来反对资产阶级；只有无产阶级，才能够推翻资产阶级的统治。在过渡时期，能够消灭任何足以产生资本统治的经济根源，能够把群众从资本的统治下彻底解放出来的，只有一个阶级，那就是无产阶级。这个阶级“被几十年反对资本的罢工斗争和政治斗争教育、联合、培养和锻炼出来，它吸取了城市的、工业的、大资本主义的全部文化，有决心和本领来捍卫、保存、发展并使全体人民全体劳动者享受这种文化成果，它受得住历史所必然加在那些冲破过去而大胆开拓通向新的未来的道路的人们身上的一切苦难、考验和巨大牺牲，它的优秀分子十分仇恨和鄙弃一切市侩的庸俗的东西，十分仇恨和鄙弃小资产阶级、小职员和‘知识分子’的那些恶劣品质，它‘经过了劳动学校的锻炼’而善于使一切劳动者和诚实的人尊重自己的劳动能力。”（列宁：“向匈牙利工人致敬”）只有这样的阶级实行专政，才有可能防止资产阶级复辟，防止资产阶级专政东山再起。而一旦离开这个阶级的专政，就必然是资产阶级的复辟。因此，问题只能是，或者是无产阶级专政，或者是资产阶级专政，任何中间的道路都是没有的。那些小资产阶级分子，既想避开无产阶级专政，而又想能够逃开资本的统治，资产阶级的统治，这只能是痴人说梦。列宁说：“只有公子少爷、蹩脚的知识分子这些学得很差的人，才会凭空幻想中间道路。世界上任何地方都没有中间道路，而且不可能有中间道路。或者是资产阶级专政（用社会革命党人和孟什维克的人民政权、立宪会议、自由等等漂亮词句掩盖着的），或者是无产阶级专政。谁没有从整个十九世纪的历史中学会这一点，谁就是不可救药的白痴。”（“为战胜高尔察克告工农书”）
    实际上，在过渡时期，所谓要走中间道路，就是为资产阶级专政开辟道路，就是资本主义的复辟。过渡时期不是别的，正是社会主义势力同资本主义势力尖锐斗争的时期，任何企图摆脱或动摇无产阶级专政的努力，都只能是在这个斗争中为资产阶级效劳，都只能是帮助资产阶级来反对无产阶级专政。小资产阶级分子和知识分子本身，在任何社会中都不能成为一种独立的社会力量，他们或者依附于无产阶级，或者依附于资产阶级。他们如果要摆脱无产阶级，就必然投奔资产阶级。苏联十月革命时期和国内战争时期中社会革命党人和孟什维克的活动，1921年社会革命党人、孟什维克和无政府主义者之类在喀琅施塔得掀起的叛乱，都确切地证明了列宁的论断：“小资产阶级民主派是无能掌握住政权的，他们的职能在任何时候都只是或则掩饰资产阶级专政，或则作为资产阶级获得专政的阶梯。”（“在共产国际第三次代表大会上关于俄国共产党策略的报告大纲（草案）”）
    如上所说，在过渡时期，或者就是无产阶级专政，或者就是资产阶级专政复辟。问题既然是这样尖锐无情地摆着，那么，取得了政权的无产阶级，就必须对一切进行反抗破坏活动的反革命分子实行坚决的镇压，而决不能有丝毫的软弱。而正是在这个问题上，某些小资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子表现得特别愚蠢和反动。他们一心向往于超阶级的“人道”“人性”“仁慈”“仁政”，厌恶和反对暴力。他们完全不懂得，国家从来就是一个阶级对另一个阶级施行暴力的工具或机器，从来就不是什么“仁慈”的东西。不是广大的劳动人民对一小撮敌人实行严酷的专政，就是一小撮敌人对广大劳动人民实行血腥的镇压，在这里进行的是你死我活的斗争，是没有任何可以调和的余地的。反革命对社会主义事业进行反抗破坏是顽强的、残酷无情的，无产阶级为了保卫社会主义革命的成果，保卫最广大劳动人民的自由幸福，就必须对任何进行反抗破坏活动的反革命分子实行坚决的镇压。在这个斗争中，任何软弱，任何犹豫动摇，都不免是放纵敌人，而最后导致反革命复辟，使千百万劳动人民为这个软弱付出大量的鲜血。因此，无产阶级和无产阶级的政党，只有坚决地实行严格的专政，才不会辜负它的领导地位，才是千百万劳动群众的真正领导者。列宁说：“专政，这是一个残酷的、严峻的、血腥的、痛苦的字眼，这样的字眼是不能随便乱讲的。”（“关于用自由平等口号欺骗人民”）指的就是这个意思。
    总之，十月革命所开创的苏联的过渡时期以它阶级斗争的全部复杂性向我们表明了：无产阶级专政乃是社会主义建设中的一个最根本的问题。无产阶级对社会的政治统治，是社会主义建设胜利和彻底消灭剥削制度的根本保证，是社会主义制度不可动摇的基石。一切拥护社会主义的人，愿意为建设社会主义社会和消灭资本主义剥削制度努力的人，在这个问题上是决不能有丝毫的犹疑和动摇的。
　　二
    十月革命是无产阶级专政对资产阶级专政的胜利，同时也就是无产阶级民主对资产阶级民主的胜利。几百年来，资本主义国家中的所谓民主，都不过是只有少数剥削者、压迫者能够享有的民主，而十月革命，第一次把民主给了广大被剥削被压迫的劳动人民，使社会真正的主人，劳动人民，在历史上第一次有了能够决定自己命运的政治权利。因而十月革命宣告了资产阶级民主的完全破产，并用在阶级还没有消灭以前所能够有的最高类型的民主，真正的民主，无产阶级的民主，来代替了它。
    一切拥护资本主义而反对社会主义的人，从第二国际机会主义者、右翼社会民主党人、叛徒考茨基之流到那些帝国主义资产阶级分子，几十年来，几乎无例外地都攻击社会主义的国家中没有民主，而只有资本主义的国家中才有民主。他们大言不惭地自诩资本主义国家为“民主国家”，而恶意地宣称社会主义国家为“极权国家”。实际上，再没有什么东西比这种攻击更荒谬更无耻的了。他们空谈“民主”和“极权”，而不敢提出民主的阶级内容，不敢指明在资本主义国家中和在社会主义国家中，究竟有“哪个阶级”的民主和没有“哪个阶级”的民主。这种糊涂抽象地提出问题，只不过表明他们有意地掩饰资本主义国家中民主的资产阶级性质，把资产阶级专政装扮成为“一般的民主”，而用来反对无产阶级专政，即无产阶级民主。
    民主在社会生活中是属于政治范围内的东西，而政治就是阶级之间的关系和斗争，就是各个阶级为争夺对社会的统治而进行的斗争，因此，在阶级社会中，民主都是有阶级性的：不是这个阶级的民主，就是那个阶级的民主，那种“全民的”“一般的”民主，从来是没有的。在一切资本主义国家中，所谓民主权利，由于有种种法律的和实际生活条件的限制，总是只有资产阶级富人能够享受到，广大的无产阶级和其他劳动人民，实际上总是享受不到的，而这些限制，又都是以有利于资产阶级为转移，都是为了保证资产阶级剥削和压迫无产阶级的那种“社会秩序”，为了保证无产阶级不能够利用这些“民主权利”来动摇资产阶级的统治。列宁说得好：“供极少数人享受的民主，供富人享受的民主，——这就是资本主义社会中的民主制。如果仔细考察资本主义民主制的结构，那么，我们无论在选举法的‘细微的’——似乎是细微的——条文上（居住的年限，妇女除外等等），或在代议机关的办事手续上，或在行使集会权的实际障碍上（公共会场不供‘穷人’享用！），或在日报纯粹按资本主义原则组织起来以及其他种种事实上，到处都可看见民主制所受到的重重限制。专门用来对付穷人的这种限制、例外、除外以及障碍等等，看来似乎是很细微的，——尤其是在那些从来没有亲身感到过贫乏，从来没有同被压迫阶级大众生活接近过的人（这种人在资产阶级的政治家和政论家中若不占百分之九十九，至少也要占十分之九）看来，是很细微的，——但是这种种限制总合起来，却把穷人排斥和摒除于政治生活之外，不让他们积极参加民主制。”（“国家与革命”）
    实际上，在一切资本主义国家中，即使是在那些最“民主”的资本主义国家中，资产阶级对无产阶级和其他劳动人民所容许的“民主权利”，往往只是涉及到非主要之点，只是涉及到对资产阶级的统治最不关紧要、最没有妨碍的方面，而只要稍稍涉及到阶级关系，涉及到统治被统治的关系，涉及到
  “被压迫阶级‘破坏’自己的奴隶状态和试图不像奴隶那样俯首听命”（“无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基”），即涉及到真正的民主权利——劳动人民决定自己命运的政治权利的时候，空言许诺给劳动人民的一切“民主权利”都会立刻化为乌有，而资产阶级专政的本相也就立刻赤裸裸地显现出来。正是在这一点上，表明了资产阶级民主制度的极端虚伪性，表明了所谓资产阶级民主，“不能不是狭隘的、残缺不全的、虚伪的、骗人的民主，对富人是天堂，对穷人和被剥削者是陷阱和骗局”（同上书），表明了无产阶级和其他劳动人民在资本主义制度下所能够得到的“民主权利”，如马克思所说的那样，实际上只不过是容许他们每隔几年有一次机会来解决这个问题：从压迫阶级中选出什么人充当这个阶级的代表来压迫和镇压劳动人民。不过如此而已。
    因此，资产阶级民主，就是资产阶级专政，就是用“全民的”“一般的”民主伪装起来的资产阶级专政。在这里，是没有无产阶级和其他劳动人民的任何真正的民主权利的。
    同资本主义国家相反，社会主义国家从来都不空言许诺什么“全民的”“一般的”民主，从来都公开声言无产阶级民主就是无产阶级专政，就是只对一部分人实行民主，而对另一部分人实行专政。在阶级社会中，一个阶级的民主权利必然要排斥另一个同它相敌对的阶级的民主权利。在资产阶级有民主的地方，就没有无产阶级的民主，而在无产阶级有民主的地方，也就没有资产阶级反动派的民主。因此，只要还存在着阶级斗争，只要还存在着敌对阶级之间的对抗，已经取得政权的无产阶级就必须坚决镇压一切反抗自己统治的阶级、社会集团和社会势力。只有这样做，才能够维持和保证无产阶级和其他劳动人民的民主权利。
    社会主义国家对占人口中极少数的敌人实行严厉的镇压，而对占人口最大多数的劳动人民，却必然实行资本主义国家所无可比拟的最广泛的民主。无产阶级专政是在历史上第一次最大多数人对最少数人的专政，即最广大的劳动人民对最少数的剥削者、压迫者的专政，这个政权的性质本身，就决定了它的全部力量和权威不能是依靠别的，只能是依靠最大限度地发扬最广大劳动群众的革命积极性和自觉性来维持。因此，对劳动人民实行最广泛的民主，同劳动人民实行最紧密的联系，乃是无产阶级政权能够在同一切内外敌人进行长期的、艰巨的斗争中坚持存在下去的根本条件。列宁1906年在同孟什维克分子进行争论的时候，曾经对于无产阶级专政的这种跟资产阶级专政完全不同的民主本色，作了出色的论述，他说，“这个力量（即革命专政——引者注）所依靠的是什么呢？它依靠人民群众。这就是这个新政权和过去一切旧政权机关之间的根本区别。那是少数人统治人民、统治工农群众的政权机关，这是人民，即工人和农民，统治少数人、统治一小撮警察式的强暴者、统治一小撮特权贵族和官僚的政权机关。这就是对人民的专政同革命人民的专政的区别，……少数人专政的旧政权，其所以能够保持得住，纯粹是依靠警察式的阴谋诡计，纯粹是依靠排斥和摈除人民，使其不能参加政权，不能监视政权。旧政权一贯不信任群众，害怕光明，用欺骗手段来保持其地位。绝大多数人专政的新政权，其所以能够保持得住和已经保持下去，纯粹是依靠最广大群众的信任，纯粹是由于它能够最自由、最广泛、最有力地吸引所有群众来参加政权。”（“立宪民主党人的胜利和工人政党的任务”）
    十月革命以后的苏联，以它的全部历史表明了无产阶级专政的这个民主本色，表明了无产阶级专政是对人民最民主的政权，在这个政权下面，劳动人民享有在剥削阶级统治下面从来得不到的最广泛、最自由地决定自己命运和创造自己新生活的权利。这是跟资产阶级民主在本质上完全不同的真正的民主，这是要比资产阶级民主更民主百万倍的最高类型的民主。
    某些小资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子，看不见无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政在民主问题上的根本区别，匍匐在资产阶级民主形式的脚下，把资产阶级的欺骗手腕看作是真正民主的标准，轻视或者有意蔑视劳动人民在无产阶级专政下面所获得的空前未有的民主权利，不认为占人口最大多数的劳动人民，社会真正的主人，是否有决定自己命运的权利，乃是真假民主的最主要标准，竟然宣称社会主义国家不民主，只有资本主义国家“民主”。这只能表明他们同劳动人民并不是同呼吸共命运，只能表明他们是同帝国主义资产阶级气味相投的。列宁说得对：“无产阶级民主比任何资产阶级民主要民主百万倍；苏维埃政权比最民主的资产阶级共和国要民主百万倍。只有自觉的资产阶级奴仆，或是政治上麻木不仁、被资产阶级书籍蒙蔽而看不见实际生活、脑子里充满资产阶级民主偏见、因而在客观上变成资产阶级走狗的人，才会看不到这一点。只有不能站在被压迫阶级的立场上提问题的人，才会看不到这一点。”（“无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基”）
      在无产阶级专政下面，劳动人民享有最广泛、最充分的民主权利，但是，无产阶级不是绝对民主主义者，它从来不把民主看作是自己奋斗的目的，而只把民主看作是为自己的解放事业服务的手段，看作是巩固无产阶级专政和社会主义建设的手段。无产阶级的民主制度，是民主集中制，就是说，这个民主是在集中指导下的民主，是民主和集中的统一。通过这种民主制度，既能够充分动员和发扬广大劳动群众的革命积极性、主动性和创造性，又能够把这些革命积极性、主动性和创造性集中成
  为统一的意志和统一的行动，使它们真正成为巩固无产阶级专政和推动社会主义建设的有效力量。在这一点上，无产阶级民主跟无政府主义和绝对民主主义是没有任何共同之点的。无政府倾向和绝对民主倾向不是无产阶级民主的倾向，而是小资产阶级民主的倾向，是小资产阶级自发势力在政治上的表现。苏联的历史表明，在过渡时期，小资产阶级自发势力总是表现成为一种长期地、千百次地动摇无产阶级专政的势力。因此，在社会主义国家中，要保卫和巩固无产阶级民主，一方面必须同那些崇拜和企图恢复资产阶级民主即资产阶级专政的倾向作斗争，一方面也必须同那些小资产阶级的无政府主义倾向作斗争，因为这种倾向同样也是反对无产阶级民主而结果引导到资产阶级专政的复辟。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（未完）
