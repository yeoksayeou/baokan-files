    Railroads Traverse East and West, Automobiles Reach the Entire Province
    Gansu's Transportation No Longer Obstructed
    (Our report) Since liberation, Gansu Province's transportation has seen rapid development. Now, railroads run from east to west, every county is accessible by automobile, every district has telephone service, and every township has postal service. The concept of "inconvenient transportation in Gansu" should be changed.
    Before liberation, there were only 52 kilometers of railway on the map within Gansu, namely the Baoji-Tianshui Railway, known as the "blind gut." Now, the total length of operating railways in the province has reached 1,540 kilometers. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has been built to Xiadong Station, 1,042 kilometers from Lanzhou. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is expected to have tracks laid to Zhaojiashui Village in Jingtai County by the end of this year. The technical renovation of the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway is expected to be completed next year.
    Before liberation, there were only 3,900 kilometers of highways open to traffic in Gansu Province, and less than one-third of the province's counties and cities were accessible by automobile. Since liberation, more than 16,000 kilometers of new and rebuilt highways have been constructed in the province, with a total operating mileage of more than 14,000 kilometers. Ninety counties and cities in the province are now accessible by automobile.
    In 1952, there were only 2,286 kilometers of telephone lines in the province. Now, the province's telephone lines have increased to more than 19,900 kilometers, and 99.06% of the districts and most of the townships in the province have telephone service.

    铁路贯东西  汽车通全省
    甘肃交通不再阻塞
    本报讯　解放以来，甘肃省的交通获得了迅速的发展。现在，铁路贯通东西，县县通汽车，区区通电话，乡乡通邮。“甘肃交通不便”的概念应该改变了。
    解放以前，甘肃境内只有五十二公里地图上的铁路，即号称“盲肠”的宝（鸡）天（水）铁路。现在，全省铁路通车里程达一千五百四十公里。兰新铁路已经修到距离兰州一千零四十二公里的峡东车站。包兰铁路预计今年年底可以铺轨到景泰县赵家水村。宝（鸡）兰（州）路的技术改造，预计明年可以完工。
    解放前，甘肃省通车的公路只有三千九百公里，通汽车的县市还不到全省县市的三分之一。解放以来，全省新建改建的公路有一万六千多公里，通车里程达一万四千多公里。全省有九十个县市通汽车。
    1952年时，全省仅有电话线路二千二百八十六公里。现在，全省的电话线路已经增加到一万九千九百多公里，全省99.06％的区和大部分的乡都已经通电话。
