Xinhua News Agency, 9th -- The Sixth National Statistical Work Conference, held in Beijing, comprehensively summarized the statistical work during our country's First Five-Year Plan and discussed in detail the tasks of statistical work in the future.

The conference pointed out that the basic principles and tasks of our country's statistical work in the past few years were correct. Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee, and through the efforts of statistical cadres nationwide, statistical work has made extremely significant achievements, and has gradually established our country's socialist statistical work from scratch.

While affirming the achievements of statistical work in the past few years, the conference also conscientiously examined some shortcomings and errors in the work. The conference believes that the reasons for the shortcomings and errors are mainly because the understanding of our country's specific situation was not deep or thorough enough in the past; there was a lack of necessary knowledge and experience in socialist statistical work; and there was insufficient understanding of the complexity and arduousness of statistical work construction.

In the process of affirming achievements and examining shortcomings, on the one hand, the conference cited a large number of facts to refute the various slanders and attacks on our country's socialist statistical work by bourgeois rightists, and drew a clear line between socialist statistics and bourgeois statistics. On the other hand, it also conducted serious criticism of various erroneous ideas existing within the statistical ranks.

The conference put forward the tasks of statistical work in the future based on the state's requirements for statistical work during the Second Five-Year Plan period. It believes that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, with the further improvement of the country's socialist construction and national economic planning and management, statistical work should also be greatly improved on the existing basis. The statistical data provided by statistical agencies should be more suitable for the needs of national construction, planning management, and scientific research. Based on this general requirement, the conference also conducted detailed discussions on various specific tasks in future work.

During the conference, Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun and Bo Yibo gave important instructions to the conference respectively.

In his speech, Bo Yibo listed facts to illustrate the important role of statistical work in all aspects of the state's understanding of the situation, decision-making, and planning. He said that in order to implement the policy of overall consideration and appropriate arrangement starting from the 600 million people, to discover contradictions within the people in a timely manner, and to adjust the contradictions within the people with foresight, it is necessary to study and calculate the overall account of the national economy and study and calculate the production and distribution of national income. To achieve this, it is impossible without establishing and improving statistical work in all departments of the national economy and without mastering comprehensive and systematic statistical data.

When talking about the role that statistical work should play in checking the implementation of plans, Bo Yibo pointed out that planning departments must rely on statistics to conduct a comprehensive and regular inspection of the plan implementation of all the hundreds of thousands of units nationwide, including industry, capital construction, and commerce. In the future, statistical departments should submit reports on plan implementation in a timely manner on a monthly and quarterly basis.

Bo Yibo said that statistical work is an indispensable and important part of our entire socialist construction cause. It is a work with strong ideological and policy implications, and is by no means a simple addition and subtraction work. Statistical work should "possess materials, analyze them, find contradictions, and propose solutions." The task of statistical workers is arduous and glorious. There have been achievements in the past, but we must continue to work hard. The question for the future is how to further strengthen and improve statistical work, not weaken it.

In his speech, Li Fuchun clearly pointed out: Statistical work is the foundation of planning work. If we want to engage in planned economy and build socialism, we must understand the country's economic situation and the situation in all aspects of the national economy. Therefore, to do a good job in planning, we must do a good job in statistical work. Without comprehensive and correct statistics, there is no comprehensive and correct plan.

Li Fuchun then gave a thorough explanation on what socialist statistics is and the fundamental difference between it and bourgeois statistics. He said that the statistical work of our socialist country serves the working people and serves socialist construction and socialist transformation. This is fundamentally different from the statistics of capitalist countries, which serve the bourgeoisie. Certain technical aspects and methods in bourgeois statistics that are useful to us can be accepted and used to serve socialism. However, our statistical standpoint and viewpoint are completely different from those of bourgeois statistics. To build our country into a socialist country, we must build socialist statistical work that is suitable for China's national conditions.

Li Fuchun pointed out that statistical work is a highly serious scientific work that must have a high level of political and ideological understanding. He asked that statistical work be able to better reflect our country's specific situation and study the laws of our country's socialist economic construction in the future. Party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over statistical work, and statistical comrades should also work steadily for a long time, continuously improve their political and ideological level, and wholeheartedly strive for greater achievements in socialist statistical work.

This conference was held from September 11th to 24th. Attending the conference were the directors of statistics bureaus from various provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and major provincial-level cities, as well as the responsible cadres for statistics and planning from relevant departments of the Central Committee.

    统计工作是计划工作的基础
    在第二个五年计划期间要把统计工作大大提高一步
    全国统计工作会议结束　李富春薄一波作了指示
    新华社9日讯　在北京举行的第六届全国统计工作会议，全面地总结了我国第一个五年计划期间的统计工作，并且详细讨论了今后统计工作的任务。
    这次会议指出，过去几年中我国统计工作的基本方针、任务是正确的。在中央的正确领导下，经过全国统计工作干部的努力，统计工作的成绩是极为显著的，已经从无到有逐步地把我国的社会主义统计工作基本上建立起来了。
    会议在肯定过去几年统计工作成绩的同时，也认真地检查了工作中的一些缺点和错误。会议认为产生缺点和错误的原因，主要是因为过去对我国具体情况还认识得不深、不透；对社会主义统计工作还缺乏必要的知识和经验；对统计工作建设的复杂性、艰巨性也认识不足。
    会议在肯定成绩，检查缺点的过程中，一方面列举大量事实驳斥了资产阶级右派分子对我国社会主义统计工作的种种诬蔑和攻击，划清了社会主义统计学和资产阶级统计学的根本区别；另方面，对统计队伍内部所存在的各种错误思想也进行了严肃的批判。
    会议根据第二个五年计划时期国家对统计工作的要求，提出了今后的统计工作任务。认为在第二个五年计划期间，随着国家的社会主义建设和国民经济计划管理工作的进一步提高，统计工作也应当在现有的基础上大大提高一步。统计机关提供的统计资料应当更适合于国家建设、计划管理和科学研究的需要。根据这一总的要求，会议对今后工作中的各项具体任务也进行了详细讨论。
    在会议进行期间，国务院副总理李富春、薄一波分别向大会作了重要指示。
    薄一波在讲话中列举事实说明统计工作对国家了解情况、决定政策、安排计划等各方面所起的重要作用。他说，要贯彻执行从六亿人民出发统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针，及时发现人民内部矛盾，并有预见地调整人民内部的矛盾，就必须研究和计算国民经济的全面大账，研究和计算国民收入的生产和分配。而要做到这一点，如果不在国民经济各部门中建立和健全统计工作，不掌握全面的系统的统计资料，那是不可能的。
    当谈到统计工作在检查计划执行情况中所应起的作用时，薄一波指出，计划部门要对全国所有工业、基建、商业等几十万个单位的计划执行情况进行全面的经常的检查，就必须依靠统计。今后统计部门应该按月、按季及时提出计划执行情况的报告。
    薄一波说，统计工作是我们整个社会主义建设事业中的一门不可缺少的重要工作，是思想性、政策性很强的工作，绝不是简单的加加减减的工作。统计工作应当“占有材料，加以分析，找出矛盾，提出办法”。统计工作者的任务是艰巨的，也是光荣的。过去有成绩，但还必须继续努力。今后的问题是如何进一步加强和提高统计工作，而不是削弱统计工作。
    李富春在讲话中明确指出：统计工作是计划工作的基础。我们要搞计划经济，要建设社会主义，就要了解国家的经济情况，了解国民经济各个方面的情况。因此，要把计划工作搞好，就要把统计工作搞好。没有全面、正确的统计，就没有全面的正确的计划。
    李富春接着就什么是社会主义统计学，以及它和资产阶级统计学的根本区别问题作了透彻的说明。他说，我们社会主义国家的统计工作，是为劳动人民服务，为社会主义建设和社会主义改造服务的。这和资本主义国家的统计为资产阶级服务有本质的区别。资产阶级统计中的某些技术方面和方法方面，凡对我们有用的，可以接受过来用以为社会主义服务。但我们统计学的立场、观点是和资产阶级统计学完全不同的。要把我国建设成为一个社会主义国家，就必须建设起适合于中国国情的社会主义统计工作。
    李富春指出，统计工作是一门高度严肃的科学工作，必须具有高度的政治思想水平。他要求统计工作今后能更好地反映我国的具体情况，研究我国社会主义经济建设的规律；各级党委要加强对统计工作的领导，统计工作同志也要长期安心工作，不断提高政治思想水平，一心一意为社会主义统计工作的更大成就而奋斗。
    这次会议是在9月11日到24日召开的。出席会议的有各省、市、自治区和主要省辖市统计局局长和中央各有关部门的统计和计划负责干部。
