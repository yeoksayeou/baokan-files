　　Greeting the Great Festival, Responding to the Party's Call
    Soviet People Enthusiastically Launch Competition
    Kazakhstan Leaps Forward Under the Soviet System
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th - According to TASS, Moscow, 14th: In every corner of the Soviet Union, people are welcoming the slogans issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to celebrate the October Revolution with unparalleled enthusiasm.

    The workers of the "Sickle and Hammer" factory in Moscow responded to the Party's call with concrete actions. Steelworker Subotin and his production team overfulfilled the plan by 28.5 tons of steel in the first twelve days of October.

    "Pravda" wrote on the 14th that the initiative of the entire staff of the Kirov factory in Leningrad, one of the initiators of gloriously welcoming the national festival by launching a competition, has been proceeding particularly well recently. The factory has consistently maintained its leading position in the All-Union October competition.

    The competition in Ukraine to welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution is rising day by day. For example, the entire staff of the Kharkov Tractor Assembly Plant has produced 41 million rubles worth of products above the plan since the beginning of this year. The factory is also preparing to manufacture three new types of tractors during the festival production period.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th - After the October Revolution, the Kazakh Republic has shaken off its past backwardness in industry and agriculture and has become the second largest granary in the Soviet Union. Its total industrial output has increased to 36 times that of 1913 before the revolution.

    Last year, Kazakhstan harvested more than 1.4 billion poods of grain (one pood equals 32.76 catties), reaching the level stipulated in the 1960 Five-Year Plan. It sold more than 1 billion poods of grain to the state, exceeding the state plan's original quota by 402 million poods. This figure is more than the total amount of grain sold by the entire republic in the eleven years before 1954.

    In 1953, Kazakhstan accounted for only 7.4% of the total grain controlled by the state, but last year it rose to 28.5%, second only to the Russian Federation.

    The vigorous development of Kazakhstan's agriculture is mainly due to the large-scale land reclamation in recent years. From 1954 to the present, Kazakhstan has reclaimed more than 20 million hectares of virgin and fallow land, which is equivalent to the total grain sowing area of ​​the United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. In 1913, the total sown area of Kazakhstan was only 4.2 million hectares, but last year it increased to 27.8 million hectares; of which 22.5 million hectares were grain, ranking second in the Soviet Union.

    Kazakhstan's animal husbandry has also developed rapidly. From 1934 to 1954, the number of cattle doubled, sheep and goats increased eightfold, and pigs and horses increased 3.5 times. From 1953 to 1956, the amount of wool Kazakhstan farmers sold to the state increased from 14,000 tons to 43,900 tons, meat increased from 152,000 tons to 300,600 tons, and milk increased from 271,000 tons to 722,000 tons.

    Before the October Revolution, Kazakhstan had almost no industry of its own, only some semi-manual enterprises processing agricultural products. Now, Kazakhstan has built approximately 3,000 modern industrial enterprises. It produces half as much steel as Turkey, four times as much coal, while its population is only one-third of Turkey's. The Karaganda coal region of Kazakhstan has now become the most mechanized coal region in the world. There, about 65% of the entire coal production process is mechanized, and many coal mines have been fully mechanized. A work team in this coal region mined 30,524 tons of coal with each "Donbass" coal mining combine in July this year, creating the world's highest monthly output record.

    Kazakhstan has very rich mineral resources. Its reserves of copper, lead, silver, chromium, nickel, etc., rank first in the Soviet Union, and coal, oil, and manganese rank second. About 700 iron ore producing areas have now been explored. The proven iron ore reserves in the Kostanay Oblast alone exceed 10 billion tons, exceeding the total iron ore reserves of France and Sweden. Kazakhstan is building a strong metallurgical industrial base. A metallurgical factory with an annual output of 1.35 million tons of pig iron is being built in Karaganda, a mineral processing complex with an annual output of 20 million tons of iron ore sand is being built in Kostanay Oblast, and eleven open-pit coal mines, each with an annual output of 3 million to 5 million tons, are planned to be built in the Ubagan coal region.

    Kazakhstan was a particularly backward cultural region in the Tsarist era. 98% of the residents were illiterate, and there was not even a university or theater. Now, Kazakhstan is completely free of illiteracy, with about 9,000 primary and secondary schools and about 30 universities. In 1956, there were 1,060 scientific workers working in the system of the Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences. In 1925, Kazakhstan established the first national theater, and now there are dozens of large and small theaters. Clubs have been established in every settlement, and film screenings can be seen in every village.

　　迎接伟大节日　响应党的号召
    苏联人民热情澎湃开展竞赛
    哈萨克在苏维埃制度下飞跃发展
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：在苏联每一个角落，人们都无比热情地欢迎苏联共产党中央委员会发布的庆祝十月革命节的口号。
    莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”工厂的工人们用具体的行动来回答了党的号召。该厂的炼钢工人苏鲍京和他的生产队在10月份的十二天里就超计划炼了二十八吨半钢。
    14日“真理报”写道，用开展竞赛来光荣地迎接全民节日的倡议者之一——列宁格勒基洛夫工厂的全体职工们，最近工作进行的特别好。该厂在十月全苏竞赛中一直保持着优胜地位。
    乌克兰为迎接十月革命四十周年而开展的竞赛一天比一天高涨。例如，哈尔科夫拖拉机装配厂的全体职工今年年初以来已经超计划生产了四千一百万卢布的产品。该厂在迎接节日的生产期间还准备制造三种新型的拖拉机。
    新华社莫斯科15日电　十月革命后，哈萨克共和国已经摆脱了过去工农业非常落后的状况，变成了苏联的第二大谷仓，它的工业总产量已经增加到革命前1913年的三十六倍。
    去年哈萨克收获了十四亿普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）以上的谷物，达到了五年计划规定的1960年的水平。它向国家交售的谷物达到十亿普特以上，超过国家计划原来的定额四亿二百万普特。这个数字比整个共和国在1954年以前的十一年中所交售的谷物总数还要多。
    1953年，哈萨克在国家所掌握的全部谷物中的比重只占7.4％，而去年就上升到28.5％，仅次于俄罗斯联邦。
    哈萨克农业的蓬勃发展主要是由于最近几年来的大规模垦荒，从1954年到现在，哈萨克开垦了两千多万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地，这相当于英国、奥地利、比利时、荷兰和德国谷物播种面积的总和。1913年，哈萨克的播种总面积只有四百二十万公顷，而去年就增加到两千七百八十万公顷；其中谷物有二千二百五十万公顷，在苏联占第二位。
    哈萨克的畜牧业也迅速发展了。从1934年到1954年，牛的头数增加了两倍，绵羊和山羊增加了八倍，猪和马增加了三点五倍。从1953年到1956年，哈萨克农民交售给国家的羊毛从一万四千吨增加到四万三千九百吨，肉类从一十五万二千吨增加到三十万零六千吨，牛奶从二十七万一千吨增加到七十二万二千吨。
    十月革命前，哈萨克几乎没有自己的工业，只有一些加工农产品的半手工的企业。现在，哈萨克已经建成了约三千个现代化的工业企业。它生产的钢比土耳其多二分之一，煤多四倍，而人口却只有土耳其的三分之一。哈萨克的卡拉干达煤区现在已经成为全世界机械化程度最高的煤区，在那里，约有65％的煤的整个生产过程都是机械化的，有许多煤矿已经全部机械化了。这个煤区的一个工作队今年7月份用每台“顿巴斯”采煤联合机开采了三万零五百二十四吨煤，创造了月产量的最高世界纪录。
    哈萨克有非常丰富的矿藏，它的铜、铅、银、铬、镍等的储藏量都占苏联第一位，煤、石油和锰占第二位。现在已经勘探出的铁矿产地约有七百个，其中库斯坦奈州已经探明的铁矿储量就超过了一百亿吨，超过了法国和瑞典铁矿储量的总和。哈萨克正在建设强大的冶金工业基地。在卡拉干达正在建设一个年产生铁一百三十五万吨的冶金工厂，在库斯坦奈州正在建设一个每年选两千万吨铁矿砂的选矿联合工厂，在乌巴干煤区准备建设十一个每年各产三百万到五百万吨的露天煤矿。
    哈萨克在沙俄时代是一个文化特别落后的地区，居民有98％是文盲，连一个高等学校和剧院也没有。现在，哈萨克完全没有文盲了，中小学约有九千所，高等学校约有三十所。1956年在哈萨克科学院系统工作的科学工作者就有一千零六十人。1925年哈萨克建立了第一个国立剧院，现在已经有数以十计的大小剧院了。在每一个居民点都建立了俱乐部，在每一个村庄都可以看到影电。
