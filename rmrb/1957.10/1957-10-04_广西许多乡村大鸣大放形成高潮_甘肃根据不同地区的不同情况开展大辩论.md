Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 2nd—The great blooming, great contending movement concerning the two roads of socialism and capitalism has gradually unfolded in over three thousand villages in Guangxi Province. In most of the pilot villages and the first batch of villages where the movement has been rolled out, the great blooming and contending is at its climax. Villages where the movement is progressing faster have already moved into the great debate stage.

In these three thousand villages, there is a group of villages where the blooming is good, the contending is thorough, and the problems are exposed completely. The debates there are vivid and the education of the masses is relatively profound. In some villages in Rong County, Yongning County, and Gui County, as soon as the blooming and contending began, cadres, Communist Party members, and Communist Youth League members bloomed and contended together with the masses. The masses' concerns were quickly dispelled, and hundreds and thousands of opinions were raised regarding cooperation, unified purchase and supply, the relationship between workers and peasants, and the style of cadres. After a climax of blooming and contending formed in Jianxin Township, Yongning County, a group of well-to-do middle peasants insisted on staying after the meeting to debate with the poor peasants. During the debate, the poor peasants cited many examples to show that their grain was sufficient and their lives had improved after joining the cooperative. However, the well-to-do middle peasants stubbornly insisted that there was not enough grain. In the end, this group of well-to-do middle peasants refused to admit defeat, claiming that they had not collected enough materials and needed to prepare for another debate. After several rounds of tit-for-tat great debates, those well-to-do middle peasants who had engaged in some exploitation in the past did not admit defeat until they had nothing more to say.

However, in another part of the villages, the cadres leading the masses' blooming and contending were satisfied with the general small blooming and small contending and did not dare to fully let go. They spent a lot of effort collecting many positive materials and repeatedly explained the superiority of socialism to the masses. As soon as the masses started to bloom and contend, many well-to-do middle peasants were immediately criticized before they even opened their mouths, resulting in the insufficient exposure of capitalist ideas and causing the movement to take a detour.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 2nd—More than 10,000 agricultural cooperatives in Gansu’s rural areas, involving over seven million farmers, have engaged in the great debate on socialism. The agricultural cooperatives carrying out the great debate account for 56.6% of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in the province. Many pastoral areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas in the province are also actively making arrangements to conduct great debates with different content according to the different conditions in different regions. For example, Zhuoni and Xiahe counties in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are preparing to conduct debates focusing on strengthening national unity, developing agricultural and animal husbandry production, consolidating cooperatives, and resolutely taking the socialist road.

The great debates in agricultural cooperatives in various places generally adopted the steps of "first inside the Party, then outside the Party," and "first cadres, then masses," carrying out propaganda and mobilization at all levels and repeatedly explaining policies. In the debates, they generally adhered to the methods of democratic debate, presenting facts, reasoning, and recalling comparisons to clarify right and wrong. Each cooperative's debate is led by cadres or work teams sent by the prefecture or county. For example, the Pingliang Prefecture sent 5,185 cadres to the countryside to lead the debate, including 600 cadres at the ministerial level, county party secretaries, county heads, and general county-level cadres, averaging two cadres per agricultural cooperative in the entire prefecture. Before the full-scale start of the great debate in various places, 192 agricultural cooperatives also conducted pilot projects, providing good experience for the comprehensive launch of the rural great debate.

    广西许多乡村大鸣大放形成高潮
    甘肃根据不同地区的不同情况开展大辩论
    据新华社南宁2日电  社会主义与资本主义两条道路的大鸣大放大争辩运动，已经在广西省三千多个乡里逐步开展起来。现在大部分试点和第一批铺开的乡，大鸣大放正处于高潮，运动进展较快的乡，已经转入大辩论。
    在这三千多个乡里，有一批鸣得好，放得透，问题暴露得彻底的乡，争辩起来就具有生动内容，对群众的教育也比较深刻。容县、邕宁和贵县有些乡鸣放一开始，干部、共产党员、共青团员就和群众在一起鸣放，群众的顾虑很快就解除了，对合作化、统购统销、工农关系和干部作风等各方面的意见，成百上千条地提了出来。邕宁县建新乡一个农业社鸣放高潮形成后，一批富裕中农在散会时仍不离去，坚持要和贫农进行辩论。辩论中，贫农举出许多实例，说明入社后粮食充裕、生活得到了改善；富裕中农却硬说粮食不够吃。最后，这批富裕中农不服输，自称没有收集好材料，要准备准备再行争辩。两方面一直经过好几次针锋相对的大论战，那些过去多少有过剥削的富裕中农，一直到无话可说时，才表示服输。
    但是，在另一部分乡里，领导群众鸣放的干部满足于一般的小鸣小放，不敢充分放手，他们花很多工夫收集了许多正面材料，再三向群众讲解社会主义优越性。群众刚刚开始鸣放，很多富裕中农还没有开口，马上就被批驳，结果，资本主义思想没有得到充分暴露，使运动走了弯路。
    新华社兰州2日电  甘肃农村已有一万多个农业社七百余万农民投入了社会主义大辩论，开展大辩论的农业社占全省农业社总数的56.6％。全省许多牧区和半农半牧区也在积极进行部署，准备根据不同地区的不同情况进行不同内容的大辩论。如甘南藏族自治州的卓尼、夏河等县准备以加强民族团结、发展农牧业生产、巩固合作社、坚决走社会主义道路为内容进行辩论。
    各地农业社的大辩论，一般都采取了先党内、后党外，先干部、后群众的步骤，层层宣传动员，反复交代政策。辩论中一般都坚持民主辩论，摆事实，讲道理，回忆对比的方法明辩是非。各社的辩论都有专区或县派去的干部或工作组领导。如平凉专区派到农村领导辩论的干部有五千一百八十五人，其中部长级和县委书记、县长及一般县级的干部就有六百人，全区每个农业社平均有两个干部。各地大辩论全面开始以前，还有一百九十二个农业社进行了试点工作，为全面展开农村大辩论提供了良好的经验。
