Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 21st: At present, the output of the Soviet chemical industry has increased to 115 times that of 1913. The Soviet Union can not only produce any kind of chemical product, but also completely match some of the world's developed countries in terms of chemical industry output.

Before the October Revolution, the Tsarist Russia's chemical industry was very backward. During the Soviet era, many chemical industrial sectors have been established in the Soviet Union. Now, the Soviet Union already has a strong chemical fertilizer industry, synthetic rubber and plastics industry, man-made fiber and petrochemical industry, etc. In the past forty years, the production of Soviet chemical fertilizers has increased 140 times.

The development of the Soviet chemical industry has opened up broad prospects for maximizing the use of all raw materials. The Soviet Union's current chemical industry can not only extract rubber from ethanol, but also extract rubber from petroleum, natural gas, acetylene, lime, and coal. This synthetic rubber can be used to manufacture more than 30,000 different rubber products.

The establishment of the man-made fiber and plastics industry is one of the major achievements of the Soviet chemical industry in the past forty years. The man-made fibers produced by the Soviet chemical industry have many advantages over natural fibers in terms of quality, such as fire resistance and water resistance. Fabrics made of man-made fibers are twenty-five times stronger than fabrics made of natural silk. Man-made fibers can also be used to make fishing nets, insulators, transmission belts, and other items.

The Soviet plastics industry can manufacture plastics that are as strong as steel, as light as wood, as transparent as glass, and as insulating as magnets. These plastics can be processed like wood, welded like metal, and molded into any shape.

In the Soviet chemical industry, the petroleum comprehensive processing industry occupies a very important position. The petroleum comprehensive processing industry can not only produce various petroleum products, but also extract thousands of different valuable products from petroleum, which are needed for the production of rubber, man-made fibers, solvents, paints, medicines, etc.

    化学工业产量四十年来增加百余倍
    新华社莫斯科21日电　目前，苏联化学工业的产量已经增加为1913年的一百一十五倍。苏联不但可以生产任何一种化学产品，而且在产量上完全可以和世界上化学工业发达的一些国家相匹敌。
    在十月革命以前，沙皇俄国的化学工业是十分落后的。在苏维埃时代中，许多化学工业部门已经在苏联建立起来。现在，苏联已经有强大的化学肥料工业、合成橡胶和塑料工业、人造纤维和石油化学工业等。在过去四十年中，苏联化学肥料的生产增加了一百四十倍。
    苏联化学工业的发展给最大限度地利用一切原料打开了广阔的远景。苏联现在的化学工业不但能够从乙醇中提炼橡胶，而且还能够从石油、天然气、乙炔、石灰和煤中提炼橡胶，这种合成橡胶可以制造三万多种不同的橡胶制品。
    人造纤维和塑料工业的建立是四十年来苏联化学工业的重大成就之一。苏联化学工业生产的人造纤维在质量上有许多胜过天然纤维的优点，如耐火性、防水性等。用人造纤维制成的衣料要比天然丝织成的料子结实二十五倍。人造纤维还可以用来制渔网、绝缘体、传动皮带等物件。
    苏联的塑料工业能够制造具有像钢铁一样坚韧、木头一样轻、玻璃一样透明和磁一样的绝缘性的塑料。这种塑料可以像木头一样来加工，像金属那样来焊接，并且能够塑造成任何一种形状。
    在苏联化学工业中，石油综合加工工业占有很重要的位置。石油综合加工工业不但可以生产各种石油产品，而且还可以从石油中提炼几千种不同的为生产橡胶、人造纤维、溶解剂、油漆、药品等所需的贵重产品。
