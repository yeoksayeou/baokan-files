　　Investigating the Yi Language of Yunnan
    Yi Script Proposal to be Submitted This Year
    (Xinhua News Agency) The fourth working team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Minority Languages Survey has arrived in batches in the Yi-populated areas of Yunnan to conduct surveys and phonetic comparisons of the Yi dialects. They plan to submit a Yunnan Yi script proposal within this year.

    Last year, after this survey team completed the Sichuan Yi language survey in the Liangshan area of Sichuan, they conducted some research on the Yunnan Yi language, initially categorizing Yunnan Yi language into more than 4,000 vocabularies and more than 2,000 supplementary vocabularies. Now, they are taking these vocabularies and local dialects back to the Yi people of Yunnan for supplementation and phonetic comparison, while continuing to collect the dialects and vocabularies of the Yi people in various parts of Yunnan.

    The Yi people are the most populous ethnic minority in Yunnan, with a total of more than 1.83 million people, including more than 30 branches, living in scattered areas, almost throughout all counties in the province. The languages also vary. At present, a very small number of branches still have a kind of incomplete pictographic script.

　　调查云南彝族语言
    年内将提出彝族文字方案
    据新华社讯　中国科学院少数民族语言调查第四工作队已经分批到达云南彝族聚居地区，对彝族地区方言进行调查和对音等工作。他们准备在今年内提出云南彝族文字方案。
    去年，这支调查队在四川凉山地区结束了四川彝语调查工作以后，便对云南彝语进行了一番研究，把云南彝语初步归为四千多个词汇和二千多个补充词汇。现在，他们把这些词汇和地方方言再拿到云南彝族人民中进行补充和对音，同时继续收集云南各地彝族的方言和词汇。
    彝族是云南少数民族中人口最多的一个民族，共有一百八十三万多人，包括三十多个支系，居住地区分散，几乎遍及全省各县。语言也各有不同之处。现在，还有极少部分支系中有着一种残缺不全的象形文字。
