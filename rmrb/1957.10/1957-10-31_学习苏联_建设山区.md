	Learning from the Soviet Union to Build Mountainous Areas

	The 40th anniversary of the great October Revolution is approaching. The October Revolution brought happiness to the Soviet people, and also to the Chinese people.
	I recall the days of the Chinese peasant delegation in the Soviet Union in 1952. I was a member of the delegation. We studied at the October Victory Collective Farm in Dolnov District, Kiev Oblast for a week. There we saw that their farm was very prosperous. There were large numbers of cattle, sheep, chickens, geese, pigs, and horses, and also orchards with various fruit trees. Wheat and various crops were so lush. The members lived very well. We also visited many collective farms, factories, schools, tractor stations, and state-owned farms in various parts of the Soviet Union, and saw many of their great achievements. A major gain that deserves special emphasis is that, after this visit, I solved the problem of how to build roads in mountainous areas. Before visiting the Soviet Union, I always felt that it was not easy to develop the barren mountainous area of Xigou, Pingshun. The natural conditions were not good, and even machines could not be used after industrialization. In the Soviet Union, we saw that in the past, they also had very barren mountainous areas, but they comprehensively developed agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, turning poor and backward mountainous areas into prosperous and affluent places. We learned how their mountainous farms comprehensively developed agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy, and learned about their farm management and financial systems, which changed our previous views and made it clear that mountainous areas must comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry.
	Since returning to China from the Soviet Union in 1952, based on the Soviet experience and combined with our specific conditions, I planned the mountainous area and formulated a five-to-fifteen-year long-term plan. In 1953, our Jinxing Agricultural Production Cooperative was renamed Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. In terms of forestry, 5,000 mu of mountains have been closed for afforestation, 6,200 mu of barren mountains have been sown, 330,000 timber trees of various types have been planted, and more than 10,000 fruit trees, including Northeast apples, Qingdao grapes, walnuts, Chinese prickly ash, peaches, apricots, etc. have been planted. Northeast apples have already blossomed and bear fruit. In terms of soil and water conservation, we have built 280 valley dams and water barriers in seven gullies, basically achieving the goal of keeping water from running down the mountains and out of the gullies. All mountain land has been built with ridges, which basically plays a role in preserving soil and fertilizer. In terms of animal husbandry, the cooperative now has more than 900 sheep, which are raised in five teams. Donkeys, mules, cattle, and horses, totaling 207, are also raised in a decentralized manner. This saves the cooperative expenses and also ensures good feeding. In terms of agriculture, we have learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience of deep plowing and careful cultivation, applying more fertilizer, selecting superior varieties, and appropriately dense planting on more than 90% of the land, and the yield has been greatly increased. Before the war, our yield per mu was 180 jin, and this year it is expected to be 450 jin per mu. The high-yield land of more than 20 mu yields 1,000 jin per mu. There are more than 300 mu of large-area high-yield land, with a yield of 600 to 800 jin per mu. There have been improvements in labor organization and management compared to the past, especially after the implementation of the "three fixes and one reward" system (fixed work, fixed output, fixed investment, and rewards for overproduction), which greatly inspired and encouraged the production enthusiasm of the members, so we have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. It is estimated that this year we can exceed the first Five-Year Plan by 28.3%. With the increase in production, the lives of the members have also improved a lot. Now, the average annual income of each member has increased by more than one time compared to before the Anti-Japanese War, and increased by 79% compared to before the establishment of the cooperative. These are some achievements made under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In the future, we will continue to work hard along the Soviet road and strive for greater achievements.
	It has been five years since I returned from the Soviet Union. But I will never forget everything I saw there, and I often miss the friends I met there. Now, no matter how busy my work is, no matter how difficult my work is, as long as I think of the decades of hard work of the Soviet people, I will be full of confidence and can overcome any difficulty.

    学习苏联　建设山区
    李顺达
    伟大的十月革命四十周年纪念日快到了。十月革命给苏联人民带来了幸福，同样也给中国人民带来了幸福。
    我回想起1952年中国农民参观团在苏联的日子。我是代表团团员之一。我们在基辅州多尔诺夫区十月胜利农庄学习了一个星期。在那里我们看到他们的农庄是非常富裕的。有大批牛、羊、鸡、鹅、猪、马，也看到生长着各种果木的果园。小麦和各种庄稼，都是那样茂盛。庄员生活很富足。我们还在苏联各地参观了许多农庄、工厂、学校、拖拉机站、国营农场，看到他们很多伟大的成就。特别值得强调提出的重大收获，就是我经过这次访问，解决了怎样建设山区的道路问题。在去苏联参观前，我对平顺西沟这个贫瘠的山区，总觉不大好办。自然条件不好，工业化以后连机器都不能使用。在苏联看到了他们在过去也是很贫瘠的山区，全面发展了农、林、牧业，把贫困落后的山区改变为繁荣富庶的地方。我们在那里学习了他们山区的农庄是怎样全面发展农、林、牧业和水利事业的，学习了他们农庄的经营管理和财务制度等经验，就改变了从前的看法，明确了山区必须农、林、牧业全面发展。
    我从1952年回国以来，根据苏联的经验，结合了我们的具体情况，把山区规划了一下，并且制定了五年到十五年的远景计划。1953年我们金星农业生产合作社就改名为金星农林牧生产合作社。在林业方面，已经封山育林五千亩，荒山播种已有六千二百亩，栽各种木材树三十三万株，果木树一万多株，其中有东北苹果、青岛葡萄、核桃、花椒、桃、杏等。东北苹果已经开花结果。在水土保持工作上，我们有七道沟已经扎了二百八十道谷坊和拦水坝，已在基本上作到了水不下山，水不出沟。所有山地都培起地梗，基本起了保土保肥的作用。在畜牧业方面，现在社里有九百多只羊，分散在五个队里喂养。驴、骡、牛、马共二百零七头，也采取了分散喂养的办法。既节省了社里开支，又喂养得好。在农业方面，我们已在90％以上的土地上学习了苏联的深耕细作，多施肥料，选用优良品种，适当密植等先进经验，产量大大提高。战前我们亩产一百八十斤，预计今年亩产是四百五十斤。高额丰产地二十多亩亩产一千斤。有大面积丰产地三百多亩，亩产得六百到八百斤。在劳动组织上和经营管理上都比过去有改进，特别是实行了三定一奖制（定工、定产、定投资、超产奖励）以后，大大启发和鼓舞了社员的生产积极性，所以今年获得空前的大丰收。预计今年可超过第一个五年计划28.3％。随着生产的提高，社员的生活也改善了很多，现在，每个社员的每年平均收入已经比抗日战争前提高一倍多；比办社前提高79％。这些都是在毛主席和共产党的领导下，学习苏联先进经验所取得的一些成绩。今后我们还要沿着苏联的道路继续努力，争取更大的成绩。
    我从苏联回来已经五年了。但我始终忘不了在那里看到的一切，还经常想念在那里认识的朋友们。现在不管我工作如何忙，工作如何困难，只要一想起苏联人民几十年的艰苦奋斗，我就信心百倍，什么困难都可以战胜。
