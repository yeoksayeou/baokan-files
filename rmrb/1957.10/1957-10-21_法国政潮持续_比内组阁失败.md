Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th. The French National Assembly rejected the appointment of right-wing Independent Party leader Bidault to form a cabinet on the night of the 18th by a vote of 248 to 198 (with 100 abstentions). Bidault is the third person to attempt to form a new cabinet since the French cabinet crisis began on September 30th, following Mollet and Pleven, and has failed.

On the 18th, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a statement on the French political situation, calling on all left-wing parties and parliamentary groups to take action to thwart Bidault's attempt to form a militant government with broad powers. The statement also stated that the Communist Party hoped to hold talks with representatives of other left-wing parties to discuss joint action to restore peace in Algeria, and to strive for "a solution to the government crisis that takes into account the positions of the left-wing forces."

Reports indicate that President Coty now intends to ask the Independent Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement to jointly discuss how to form a stable cabinet.

    法国政潮持续
    比内组阁失败
    据新华社巴黎19日电  法国国民议会18日夜间以二百四十八票对一百九十八票（一百票弃权）拒绝委任右翼的独立党领袖比内组织内阁。比内是自从9月30日法国内阁危机发生以来，继摩勒和普利文之后尝试组织新内阁遭到失败的第三人。
    在18日这一天，法国共产党中央委员会政治局曾经就法国政局发表声明，号召一切左翼党派和议会党团行动起来，以挫败比内想组成一个拥有广泛权力的好战政府的企图。声明还表示，共产党希望同其他左翼党派的代表进行会谈，讨论为恢复阿尔及利亚和平而采取联合行动的问题，并且争取“在考虑左翼力量的立场的情况下解决政府危机”。
    有消息说，戈蒂总统今后准备要求独立党、社会党和人民共和党三党共同商讨如何组成一个稳定内阁的途径。
