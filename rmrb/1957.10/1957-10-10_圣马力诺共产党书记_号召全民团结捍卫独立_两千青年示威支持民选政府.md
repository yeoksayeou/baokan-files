Xinhua News Agency, Rome, October 7th: According to TASS, San Marino Communist Party Secretary Gasperoni delivered a speech at a mass rally attended by two thousand people on October 7th, calling on the entire people to unite and defend the independence of the republic.

Gasperoni spoke about the recent events in the republic. He pointed out that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party of San Marino are united. He said, "In order to defend the independence of our republic, it is necessary for the entire people to unite."

Secretary of State for Internal Affairs Morganti said that the so-called "provisional government" is illegal and self-appointed, and its "power" is entirely backed by Italian armored vehicles.

Milan's "Daily" reported that the puppet "government" is currently recruiting former Italian cavalry police to join the armed forces it is building.

Xinhua News Agency, October 8th: San Marino dispatch: Two thousand young people from all over San Marino gathered in San Marino's Government Square on the afternoon of the 6th to express their full support for the government. This is the largest demonstration held in the capital of this republic with a population of just over 13,000 since the Christian Democratic Party launched a coup on October 1st in an attempt to overthrow the democratically elected government composed of Communists and Socialists.

The regents and ten Communist and Socialist parliamentarians, who were holding firm in the government building to defend the democratic regime, addressed the demonstrators from the balcony of the government building.
