Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 29th - Indonesian Minister of Information Sudibyo stated at a press conference on the 28th that the Indonesian government is mobilizing the power of the entire nation to engage in the struggle for the liberation of West Irian and construction activities. Sudibyo said that the government has organized an Action Committee for the Liberation of West Irian and will launch a nationwide movement to strive for the liberation of West Irian, starting from the "Youth Pledge Day" on October 28th.

Sudibyo said that this movement includes three climaxes. The first climax is combined with the activities of "Youth Pledge Day" to mobilize the masses to support the struggle for the liberation of West Irian. The second climax will appear on November 10th, commemorating the "Heroes' Day" when the people of Surabaya resisted the British invading forces in 1945. The third climax will be the highest point of the movement, which will occur when the United Nations General Assembly discusses the West Irian issue.

Sudibyo also said that the government will make preparations morally, spiritually, and materially for the liberation of West Irian. These tasks include strengthening the solidarity of Asian and African countries, domestic unity, and mobilizing all national forces. He said that the material preparation for the liberation of West Irian will be discussed at the construction conference to be held in November, with the participation of central and local representatives.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, after attending the Colombo Plan countries' conference in Saigon, said upon returning to Jakarta on the 27th that if the struggle for Indonesia to recover West Irian had to be transferred from the United Nations to the two battle lines of Indonesia and the Netherlands, it would cause a cold war; he also said that this would endanger Asian peace and lead to a world war. Subandrio had previously said that the struggle to recover West Irian should be carried out on three battle lines: the United Nations, Indonesia, and the Netherlands.

The Chiefs of Staff of the Indonesian Navy and Air Force have also expressed their attitude, saying that they are ready and are now only waiting for the government's order to recover West Irian. The Air Force Chief of Staff said that the Air Force has already opened airports on islands near West Irian.

Recently, parties and mass organizations in various parts of Indonesia have issued statements supporting the government's determination to recover West Irian.

Ten thousand youths in Jakarta held a torchlight parade on the evening of the 28th to commemorate "Youth Pledge Day." The main slogan in the parade was "Recover West Irian."

On October 28, 1928, youth representatives from all over Indonesia took an oath at a congress to unite and fight for independence. This day was designated as "Youth Pledge Day."

The parade was led by the army and police, followed by teams from youth, worker, and student organizations. They held up banners with slogans demanding the recovery of West Irian, and burned a paper figure symbolizing Dutch colonialism when passing by the residence of the Dutch diplomatic representative in Indonesia. The parading masses then entered the Independence Palace, where they were received by the First and Third Deputy Prime Ministers and the Foreign Minister.

The youths participating in the parade gathered at the Banteng Square in Jakarta, where a get-together was held. The Mayor of Jakarta, Sudiro, and the Jakarta Garrison Commander, Dahyar, delivered speeches to the youths. Dahyar called on everyone to take clear actions to recover West Irian.

    收复西伊里安运动高涨
    印度尼西亚政府发动人民投入斗争
    本报综合报道　据新华社雅加达29日电，印度尼西亚情报部长苏迪比约28日在记者招待会上说，印度尼西亚政府正在使全国人民的力量投入争取解放西伊里安的斗争和建设活动。苏迪比约说，政府已经组织了一个解放西伊里安行动委员会，从10月28日“青年宣誓日”开始开展一个争取解放西伊里安的全国性运动。
    苏迪比约说，这个运动包括三个高潮。第一个高潮是结合“青年宣誓日”的活动，发动人民群众支援解放西伊里安的斗争。第二个高潮将在11月10日纪念泗水人民在1945年抵抗英国侵略军队的“英雄节”时出现。第三个高潮将是运动的最高点，它将要在联合国大会讨论西伊里安问题时出现。
    苏迪比约还说，政府将要在道义上、精神上和物质上为争取解放西伊里安进行准备工作。这些工作包括加强亚非国家的团结、国内的团结和动员全国一切力量等等。他说，在11月间召开的有中央和地方代表参加的建设会议上，将要讨论解放西伊里安的物质准备问题。
    印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约在西贡参加了科伦坡计划国家会议以后，27日在回到雅加达时说，如果印度尼西亚收复西伊里安的斗争不得不从联合国转移到印度尼西亚和荷兰这两条战线上进行的话，那就会引起一场冷战；他还说这将危害亚洲和平并且导致世界大战。苏班德里约曾经说过，收复西伊里安的斗争要在联合国，印度尼西亚和荷兰这三条战线上进行。
    印度尼西亚海、空军参谋长也表示态度说，他们已经作好准备，现在只等待政府的收复西伊里安的命令。空军参谋长说，空军已经在西伊里安附近的岛屿上开辟机场。
    最近印度尼西亚各地的党派和群众团体纷纷发表声明，支持政府关于收复西伊里安的决心。
    雅加达的十万青年在28日晚间举行了火炬游行，纪念“青年宣誓日”。游行中的主要口号是“收复西伊里安”。
    1928年10月28日印度尼西亚各地的青年代表曾经在代表大会上宣誓团结一致，为争取独立而斗争。这一天被定为“青年宣誓日”。
    游行队伍由军队和警察前导，接着是青年、工人和学生组织的队伍。他们高举着写有要求收复西伊里安的口号的标语，并且在经过荷兰驻印度尼西亚的外交代表的住宅时，焚烧了一个象征着荷兰殖民主义者的纸扎人像。游行群众随后进入独立宫，由第一、第三副总理和外交部长接见。
    参加游行的青年集中到雅加达市内的雄牛坪广场，在那里举行了联欢会。雅加达市长苏迪罗和雅加达卫戍司令达赫亚尔向青年们发表了演说。达赫亚尔号召大家以明确的行动来收复西伊里安。
