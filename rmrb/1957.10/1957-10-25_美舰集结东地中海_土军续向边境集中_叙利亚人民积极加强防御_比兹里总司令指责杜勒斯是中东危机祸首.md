Xinhua News Agency Compilation: Damascus News: The Syrian newspaper "Al-Jamahir" quoted official sources as saying that Turkish troops are stepping up their concentration along the Syrian border.

The report also said that under the leadership of American military experts, the Turkish authorities hastily built a new military airport in the Der-Maliki town area near the Syrian border.

Rome News: The United States has currently amassed 93 warships and 50,000 troops in the Eastern Mediterranean, plotting to intervene in Middle Eastern affairs. It is pointed out that this is the largest concentration of American warships in the Mediterranean since the war.

United Press International reported that the U.S. Sixth Fleet, the core of this fleet, has always been known as "Eisenhower's Big Stick." During the climax of the Jordanian coup in April of this year, the Sixth Fleet set sail from ports in France and Italy to the Jordanian sea to exert pressure for American foreign policy.

Aleppo News: Syrian Defense Minister Azem said on the 23rd that all Syrian cities will rapidly establish defense fortifications like Aleppo.

Aleppo is located in northern Syria, near the Turkish border. On the 22nd, Aleppo Administrative Governor Ismail Kouri presided over the opening of "Strengthening Fortifications Week." He led 20,000 voluntary workers in digging trenches and installing obstacles around the city.

At the same time, in important cities such as Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, and Latakia, members of the People's Resistance Organization are receiving combat training in "self-defense warfare." Colonel Salah Bizri, commander of the People's Resistance Organization, said: "We have united on all fronts and are prepared to defend ourselves against any foreign aggression."

The Syrian people, including women, are enthusiastically participating in civil defense organizations. Civil defense work in Aleppo has been organized, and first-aid stations have been established locally. Civil defense volunteers in Damascus have been ordered to gather from October 26th to 28th to hear instructions regarding their duties. During air raids and battles, civil defense organizations are responsible for security, fire fighting, and first aid duties.

On the 23rd, Bizri, Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Staff of the Syrian Armed Forces, accused U.S. Secretary of State Dulles of being the mastermind behind the Middle East crisis. He pointed out that the only way to resolve the crisis is for Turkey to withdraw its troops and stop interfering in Syria's internal affairs.

Bizri said at a press conference that unidentified aircraft intrude into Syrian airspace almost daily and penetrate deep into the interior. These aircraft have flown over Homs, about 100 miles from Damascus. He said he believes these aircraft may be from the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, as this fleet is coordinating with Turkish troops massing on the Syrian border.

Bizri said that there are no signs that the Turkish troops concentrated on the Syrian border are withdrawing, nor is there any indication that they are willing to withdraw. He pointed out that the concentration of Turkish troops began after U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson visited the Middle East, with the aim of attacking Syria.

Bizri said: "To know further information and details, you can ask U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, because he knows more details than anyone else in the world." He said: "The solution to the crisis may be to change Dulles and his policies."

Bizri refuted the claim that having a UN emergency force stationed on the Syrian-Turkish border would ease the situation. He said that there is no war between Syria and Turkey, nor is there a ceasefire line. "If we agree to have UN observers on the Syrian-Turkish border, then UN observers can be sent to all borders in the world that use stones as demarcation marks. This is not the solution to the problem."

Bizri said: "When Turkey understands that the policy of threatening Syria will not bring them any benefits, there will be no crisis."

    美舰集结东地中海　土军续向边境集中
    叙利亚人民积极加强防御
    比兹里总司令指责杜勒斯是中东危机祸首
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：大马士革消息：叙利亚“群众报”引述官方消息说，土耳其军队正在沿着叙利亚边境加紧集中。
    消息还说，土耳其当局在美国军事专家的领导下，在叙利亚边境附近德尔—马利基镇地区匆忙地建成了一个新的军用飞机场。
    罗马消息：美国目前在东地中海面集结了九十三艘军舰和五万兵员，阴谋伺机干涉中东事务。据指出，这是战后以来美国军舰在地中海面集中规模最大的一次。
    合众社消息指出，作为这批舰只的核心的美国第六舰队素来有“艾森豪威尔主义的大棒子”的称号。今年4月约旦政变发展到高潮时，第六舰队曾经从法国和意大利的港口起锚驶向约旦海面替美国的外交政策施加压力。
    阿勒颇消息：叙利亚国防部长阿泽姆23日说，叙利亚各个城市都将像阿勒颇一样，迅速地建立起防御工事。
    阿勒颇在叙利亚北部，靠近土耳其边境。22日，阿勒颇行政长官伊斯梅尔·库里主持了“加强防御工事周”的开工。他率领二万名义务工挖掘战壕，并且在城市周围安设障碍物。
    同时，在大马士革、阿勒颇、霍姆斯以及拉塔基亚等重要城市，人民抵抗组织的成员正在接受“自卫战”的战斗训练。人民抵抗组织司令萨拉赫·比兹里上校说：“我们已经在各个战线上团结起来，准备保卫自己，抵抗任何外来的侵略。”
    叙利亚的人民包括妇女在内，热情地参加民防组织。阿勒颇的民防工作已经组织起来，当地还建立了急救站。大马士革的民防志愿人员奉命在10月26日到28日集合听取关于他们的职责的指示。民防组织在空袭和战斗时担任保安、消防和急救勤务。
    叙利亚武装部队总司令兼参谋长比兹里23日指责美国国务卿杜勒斯是中东危机的幕后指使人。他指出，解决危机的唯一办法是土耳其撤走它的军队和停止干涉叙利亚内政。
    比兹里在记者招待会上说，国籍不明的飞机几乎每天都侵入叙利亚领空，并且深入腹地。这种飞机飞到过距离大马士革一百英里左右的霍姆斯上空。他说，他认为这种飞机可能是从地中海上的美国第六舰队来的，因为这个舰队正在配合土耳其军队在叙利亚边境集结。
    比兹里说，集中在叙利亚边境的土耳其军队没有撤走的迹象，甚至没有愿意撤走的任何表示。他指出，土耳其军队的集中是在美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊访问中东以后开始的，其目的是为了进攻叙利亚。
    比兹里说：“要知道进一步的情况和详情，你们可以问美国国务卿杜勒斯，因为他比世界上谁都知道得更详细。”他说：“解决危机的办法可能是杜勒斯和他的政策都改换掉。”
    比兹里驳斥了所谓让联合国紧急部队驻在叙利亚—土耳其边境上会缓和局势的说法。他说，叙利亚同土耳其之间没有战争，也没有停战线。“如果我们同意联合国观察员到叙利亚—土耳其边境，那么全世界所有用石块作分界标志的国境上都可以派联合国观察员。这不是解决问题的办法。”
    比兹里说：“当土耳其理解到，威胁叙利亚的政策不会对它们带来什么好处的时候，那就不会有危机了。”
