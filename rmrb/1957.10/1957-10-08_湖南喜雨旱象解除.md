Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 7th October. Since late September, Hunan has been experiencing continuous welcome rains, completely alleviating the drought that had developed earlier.

According to reports from various regions to the provincial agricultural department, of the province's 10.5 million mu of late rice, the vast majority is growing well, except for a very small portion that yielded nothing due to the prolonged drought. All autumn crops are also expected to have a good harvest. Currently, farmers across the province are sowing winter crops. Nearly half of the paddy fields in the province that need to be plowed this winter have already been plowed.

    湖南喜雨旱象解除
    新华社长沙7日电　湖南各地从9月下旬以来连日喜雨，前一时期一度形成的旱象完全解除。
    据各地向省农业部门反映：全省一千零五十万亩晚稻除极少数因久旱无收以外，绝大部分生长良好；全部秋季作物也将有一个好收成。目前，省内农民正在播种冬季作物。今冬全省需要翻耕的板田，已有将近一半经过翻耕。
