Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th: The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is helping various enterprises and units to earnestly improve their work in the rectification movement.

Under the assistance of the Municipal Committee, various industrial enterprises have properly handled many criticisms from the masses. Based on the opinions of the masses, many units have revised some leadership systems that were not entirely reasonable in the past, reduced the number of excessive meetings, and allowed leading cadres to have more time to go deep into the lower levels to solve key problems in production and life. The Party Committee members of the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory have clearly divided their responsibilities, with each person maintaining regular contact with several non-Party engineers, workshop directors, section chiefs, and technicians. Leading cadres from seven enterprises, including the Taiyuan Chemical No. 2 Company and the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, decided to take turns being on duty in the mass reception room (station) to directly listen to the opinions of the masses. Leading cadres from various enterprises participating in physical labor has become a common system. When leading cadres of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant worked with the workers in the ingot casting section, they found that the labor intensity of the slag removal workers was too high, and they could not clear the slag on time, which affected the timely tapping of steel. The next day, they adjusted the labor organization and increased the number of slag removal workers. The workers said, "Now the leading cadres are very different from the past."

When handling the opinions of the masses, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee also helped many units solve problems that required the cooperation of brother factories. For example, the masses raised the issue that many construction units undertaking projects and the factory construction units had a phenomenon of "passing the buck," and the problem was difficult to solve. After the Municipal Committee understood this situation, it immediately mediated for both parties, solved the difficulties, and mobilized both parties to organize a "joint construction site office," which accelerated the progress of the project. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee also made full use of the "Rectification Bulletin" to promptly put forward the current direction and methods for improving work to various units.

    中共太原市委深入领导  帮助各厂矿改进工作
    新华社太原4日电　中共太原市委帮助各个企业单位在整风运动中认真改进工作。
    各工业企业在市委帮助下，已经妥善地处理了许多来自群众的批评意见。根据群众意见，许多单位修订了过去一些不尽合理的领导制度，压缩了过多的会议，让领导干部有更多的时间深入下层，解决生产和生活上的关键问题。太原机车车辆修理厂的党委委员们明确地分工，每人要和几个非党工程师、车间主任、科长、技术员保持经常的联系和接触。太原化学二公司、太原矿山机器厂等七个企业的领导干部，决定在群众来访接待室（站）轮流值班，直接听取群众的意见。各个企业领导干部参加体力劳动已经普遍形成制度。太原钢铁厂领导干部在铸锭工段和工人一起劳动时，发现清碴工劳动强度过大，也不能按时清理矿碴，影响按时出钢，第二天就调整了劳动组织，增加了清碴工。工人们说：“现在领导干部和过去大不一样了”。
    在处理群众意见时，太原市委还帮助许多单位解决了需要兄弟厂协作才能办到的问题。如群众提出不少承建工程的单位和建厂单位有“扯皮”现象，问题很难解决，市委了解这一情况后，立即为双方调解，解决困难，并发动双方组织了“工地联合办公室”，使工程进度加快。太原市委还充分运用“整风简报”，及时向各单位提出当前改进工作的方向和方法。
