    Socialist Education Movement Achieves Remarkable Results
    Production Enthusiasm of Workers and Staff in Liaoning's Industrial and Mining Enterprises Increases

    (Our newspaper, Shenyang, 30th) The massive socialist education movement in the Liaoning area has brought new impetus to the production work of industrial and mining enterprises. As a result, remarkable results have been achieved in completing production tasks, improving product quality, consolidating labor discipline, and increasing labor productivity. According to the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Statistics, the total output value of state-owned industries in the province is expected to exceed the plan by 1.2% in the third quarter. Compared with last year, the total output value increased by 10.4%. From January to September, the province produced an additional 90,000 tons of raw coal, 680,000 tons of pig iron, 660,000 tons of steel, and 810,000 tons of coke. The labor productivity plan is also expected to be overfulfilled by 2%. Product quality has also been greatly improved. According to statistics on the quality of seventeen products, eleven of them showed improvement compared to the same period last year. The most common phenomenon after enterprises carried out socialist education is the great enhancement of the organization and discipline of the workforce. In the past, many factories had workers who loitered during work, disobeyed production commands, and were often absent or late. The phenomenon of picking and choosing easy tasks when working and "rushing during piecework and dragging during hourly work" was even more common. After the launch of the mass socialist education movement, this situation has fundamentally changed. For example, at the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, worker absenteeism is now rare, and there are no instances of disobedience. In the past, workers always bargained when accepting quotas, but now many groups are taking the initiative to revise quotas. For example, the youth work section of the complete set workshop voluntarily reduced quotas by 30%. Five groups in the cold working workshop also wanted to reduce working hour quotas. In May of this year, twenty-eight employees occupied newly built dormitories without permission and refused to move out even after persuasion from leaders. After the socialist education movement began, twenty employees immediately and consciously withdrew from the occupied housing. Li Yuwu, a worker in the complete set workshop who had a bad record of labor discipline in the past and called himself "Master Grandfather," now frequently overfulfills his tasks and took the lead in rescuing products during heavy rain at night, thus avoiding losses to the state. The general atmosphere in many enterprises is that righteousness has been greatly promoted and evil has been greatly suppressed. This is an important reason why production is better than ever, even though enterprises are currently facing heavy tasks.

    社会主义教育运动取得显著效果
    辽宁工矿职工生产积极性提高
    本报沈阳30日电  辽宁地区声势浩大的社会主义教育运动给工矿企业的生产工作带来了新的动力，因此无论在完成生产任务、提高产品质量、巩固劳动纪律、提高劳动生产率方面都有了极为显著的效果。据辽宁省统计局预计，全省第三季度国营工业总产值可以超过1.2％完成。和去年比较，总产值增长10.4％。1至9月多生产了九万吨原煤，六十八万吨生铁，六十六万吨钢材，八十一万吨焦炭。劳动生产率计划亦可超额2％完成。产品质量也有很多改进。据十七种产品质量统计，比去年同时提高的就有十一种。企业进行社会主义教育后最普遍的现象是工人队伍的组织性纪律性有了极大的增强。过去有的工厂职工在工作时蹓蹓跶跶、不服从生产指挥、旷工迟到的现象不少，至于干活时挑肥拣瘦，“计件打冲锋，计时磨洋工”的现象就更为普遍。群众性的社会主义教育运动开展后这种情况有了根本改观。如沈阳高压开关厂，目前职工旷工的现象很少了，不服从指挥的事情没有了，过去接受定额总要讨价还价，现在不少小组还要主动修改定额。如成套车间青年工段主动降低了30％。冷作车间也有五个小组要降低工时定额。今年5月有二十八名职工未经批准就擅自抢占了新盖的宿舍，虽经领导动员也不肯搬出来。社会主义教育运动开始后，马上有二十名职工自觉地退出了抢占的住宅。过去劳动纪律很坏并自称为“四大爷”的成套车间工人李玉武，现在却经常超额完成任务，并于夜间下大雨时带头抢救产品，因而避免了国家的损失。许多企业普遍的气象是：正气大大伸张，邪气大大下降。这就是为什么目前企业任务繁重而生产情况却较任何时候都好的一个重要原因。
