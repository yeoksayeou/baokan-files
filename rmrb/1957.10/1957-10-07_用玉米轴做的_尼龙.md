    "Nylon" Made from Corn Cobs

    Recently, the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry's laboratory successfully trial-produced "Nylon 66".

    "Nylon" is a new type of advanced plastic product. It has the functions of acid resistance, moisture resistance, corrosion resistance, and mildew resistance, and has strong toughness. It can not only be widely used in various industrial fields, but also can be used to manufacture a wide variety of daily utensils and textiles. If it is drawn into filaments for weaving, each centimeter of nylon can be extended into 9,000 meters of silk, woven into various brightly colored nylon textiles, and the wear resistance is about ten times that of cotton fabrics.

    "Nylon 66" is one of the strongest and most technically complex of the several types of nylon. It is synthesized by extracting furfural from corn stalks, corn cobs, and sugar beet residue after sugar extraction, and then going through several technological processes.

    The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry has decided to establish an intermediate experimental factory with a daily output of 50 to 100 kilograms of nylon in early 1958.

    用玉米轴做的“尼龙”
    最近黑龙江省工业厅实验室试制“尼龙六六”成功。
    “尼龙”是一种新型的高级塑料产品。具有抗酸、隔潮、防腐、耐霉等作用，并有强大的韧性。它不但可以广泛地应用于各种工业方面，而且可以制造出多种多样的日用器皿和纺织品。如果用它拔丝织布，每一公分尼龙可以拓丝九千公尺，织成各种颜色鲜艳的尼龙纺织品，耐磨程度相当于棉织品的十倍左右。
    “尼龙六六”是数种尼龙中韧性最强和生产技术比较复杂的一种。它是从玉米秸、玉米轴和榨过糖的废甜菜丝中提取出糖醛，再经过数道工艺过程引入合成的。
    黑龙江省工业厅已经决定在1958年初，建立一座日产五十到一百公斤尼龙的中间实验工厂。
