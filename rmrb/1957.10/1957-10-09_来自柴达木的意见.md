    Opinions from Qaidam
    The following is an excerpt from a letter from workers in Qaidam regarding opinions on news reports about the basin, provided for your reference. The letter states: Some newspapers, magazines, and films do not report truthfully about Qaidam, or are somewhat one-sided. They only report the good aspects (which is, of course, necessary), but are afraid to report the difficult aspects. We hope the People's Daily will pay attention to this phenomenon.　General Office of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry

    来自柴达木的意见
    柴达木职工来信中对有关盆地新闻报道的意见，摘转你们参考。来信说：有一些报纸、刊物和影片对柴达木的报道不够真实，或者有些片面。他们只报道好的一面（这当然是应该的），却害怕报道艰苦的一面。希望人民日报能够注意这种现象。　石油工业部办公厅
