    The Tibetan People Strive to Strengthen Patriotism, Unity, and Progress on the Existing Foundation
    Dalai Lama

    On the grand festival of the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Tibetan people, like all ethnic groups across the country, are holding grand celebrations with joyful hearts.

    Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have shaken off the oppression of foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries. In just a few years, they have not only carried out the restoration of the national economy but also steadily and victoriously completed social transformation and various great movements. Especially last year, after the socialist transformation was completed in most parts of the country, the productive forces were greatly improved. This has not only greatly developed and improved politics, economy, culture, and people's living standards, but also ensured that our country's first five-year plan will be overfulfilled this year. These are incredible and superior achievements obtained in a very short period, and the results of socialist construction are still expanding.

    Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, it has developed in politics, economy, and culture. It has also newly increased hundreds of avenues for good in promoting social development and construction, freedom of religious belief, respect for customs, and strengthening unity among all parties. Last year, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which includes the Tibet Local Government, the Panchen Kampot Meeting Hall, and the Qamdo area, was established, laying a new foundation for the Tibetan people to fully enjoy their rights as masters of their own affairs. Thanks to the active efforts of Tibetan and Han cadres, the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has also achieved certain results.

    The fundamental way for national development lies in reform and taking the socialist road. The central government has decided not to carry out reforms in Tibet during the second five-year plan, which is a correct policy that fully conforms to the current specific situation in Tibet. The detailed and concise meaning of this policy has been or is being promoted and educated to the Tibetan people. On the existing foundation, the Tibetan people must actively strive to strengthen patriotism, unity, and progress. The institutions under the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region had the shortcoming of being too large, and the work of streamlining and reorganization has been completed. Now only a very small number of Han cadres are retained to carry out assistance work, and the rest are all Tibetan cadres. In the future, monks, laypersons, and staff in the new and old institutions should unite with the Han cadres, establish close ties with the monks, laypersons, and the people, jointly create various conditions, and actively strive to build a new Tibet with prosperous politics and religion and complete happiness.

    西藏人民在已有的基础上  努力加强爱国—团结—进步
    达赖喇嘛
    在中华人民共和国成立八周年这个重大的节日里，西藏人民和全国各族人民一样以欢腾的心情举行盛大庆祝。
    在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的正确领导下，全国人民摆脱了外国帝国主义和国内反动派的压迫，在短短的几年当中，不但进行了国民经济的恢复工作，并稳步胜利地逐渐完成了社会改造和各种伟大的运动。特别在去年，全国大部分地区完成了社会主义改造以后，生产力大大提高了，这不仅使政治、经济、文化、人民生活水平等方面都获得了很大发展和提高，而且在今年内已肯定超额完成我国第一个五年计划。这些，都是在极短的时间中获得的不可思议的优越成果，而且现在还正在不断地扩大着社会主义建设的成果。
    西藏自从和平解放以来，在政治、经济、文化等方面都得到发展，在促进社会发展的建设事业、信教自由、尊重风俗习惯和加强各方面之间的团结等方面，也新增长了成百的善门。去年成立了包括西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅、昌都地区三方面的统一的西藏自治区筹备委员会，从而奠定了藏族充分享受当家作主权利的新基础。由于藏汉工作人员积极努力，西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作也获得了一定成绩。
    民族发展的根本在于改革，在于走社会主义道路。中央已决定第二个五年计划期间内在西藏不进行改革，这是完全符合西藏当前具体情况的正确方针。这个方针的详细扼要的意义，已经或正在向西藏人民进行宣传教育。西藏人民在已有的基础上，必须积极努力加强爱国、团结、进步。西藏自治区筹备委员会所属机构因有太庞大的缺点，已完成了精简整编的工作，现在只保留了进行帮助工作的极少数汉族干部，其余大部分完全是藏族干部。今后，各新、旧机构中的僧俗工作人员，都应该与汉族工作人员团结一致，并切实与僧俗人民取得亲密联系，共同创造各种条件，为建设一个政教昌隆、圆满幸福的新西藏而积极努力。
