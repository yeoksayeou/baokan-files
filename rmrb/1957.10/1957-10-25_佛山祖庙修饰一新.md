The Ancestral Temple in Foshan Renovated

Among the ancient buildings in Guangdong, there are not many historical sites as colorful as the Ancestral Temple.

The Ancestral Temple was first built during the Yuanfeng period of the Northern Song Dynasty. The architecture is rich in local characteristics, with highly distinctive stucco, wood carvings, and pottery sculptures featuring Shiwan ceramics. The Ancestral Temple fully embodies the excellent traditions and characteristics of ancient Chinese architecture.

The Ancestral Temple has been renovated and opened for visitors. People can see the rich legacy of our country's architectural art here.

    佛山祖庙修饰一新
    在广东的古代建筑中，像祖庙那样多姿多采的古迹，是不多见的。
    祖庙初建于北宋元丰年间。建筑富有地方色彩很浓的批塑、木雕和石湾陶器特色的陶塑。祖庙充分体现了我国古代建筑的优良传统和特色。
    祖庙经过修饰已经开放供游人参观。人们可以从这里看到祖国建筑艺术上的丰富遗产。
