Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 28th: According to TASS, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on October 27th, submitting the "Soviet Proposal on the Establishment of a Permanent Disarmament Committee" for review by the UN General Assembly.

The proposal requests:

	I. The establishment of a Permanent Disarmament Committee composed of all member states of the United Nations.
	The task of the committee is to discuss various disarmament proposals accepted by the United Nations and to formulate relevant proposals to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly.

	II. Stipulate that the Permanent Disarmament Committee should work regularly. The meetings of the committee should be open to the public.

	III. Stipulate that the committee should elect a chairman and several vice-chairmen, whose task is to lead the daily work of the committee and assist UN member states in consultations, meetings, etc., on disarmament issues.

	IV. Entrust the Secretary-General to provide the committee with the necessary assistance so that it can carry out its work smoothly.

	V. In view of the establishment of the Permanent Disarmament Committee, the existing Disarmament Commission and its subcommittees should be abolished.

The proposal states that, as the arms race intensifies, new types of weapons in the armaments of various countries, especially atomic and hydrogen weapons, and intercontinental ballistic missiles (the use of which in war would threaten any region in the world with attack) are increasing. The existing situation requires the United Nations to make new efforts, in accordance with its responsibilities, to resolve the disarmament issue and conclude relevant agreements or agreements between countries. The United Nations Disarmament Commission and its subcommittees have discussed the issue of disarmament for many years, but no agreement has been reached between countries. One of the reasons is that only a small number of countries (five UN member states in the UN Disarmament Subcommittee and twelve in the UN Disarmament Commission) participate in the discussion of disarmament issues. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a broadly representative body to discuss disarmament issues so that all countries can actively participate in the discussion of disarmament issues. At the same time, making the activities of the Permanent Disarmament Committee public can make the issue of disarmament the focus of attention of the people of all countries, so that the people of all countries can fully understand the progress of the negotiations and the positions of various countries.

The proposal states that the establishment of a Permanent Disarmament Committee does not preclude the possibility of individual countries or some countries discussing various disarmament issues. On the contrary, such discussions will only expand the ways of contact between countries, such as consultations and talks.

    联合国必须对裁军问题作出新的努力
    苏外长建议成立常设裁军委员会
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社纽约28日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯10月27日写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，提出了“苏联关于成立常设裁军委员会的建议”，交给联合国大会审查。
    建议要求：
    一、成立由联合国全体会员国组成的常设裁军委员会。
    委员会的任务是讨论联合国受理的各项裁军建议，并且拟定有关建议提交联合国大会会议。
    二、规定常设裁军委员会经常进行工作。委员会的会议应该是公开的。
    三、规定委员会中选出主席一名和副主席若干名，其任务是领导委员会的日常工作以及协助联合国会员国就裁军问题进行协商、开会等等。
    四、委托秘书长给委员会以必要的照应，使它能顺利进行工作。
    五、鉴于常设裁军委员会的成立，取消现有的裁军委员会及其小组委员会。
    建议说，由于军备竞赛越来越加紧，各国的军备中的新式武器，首先是原子武器和氢武器，洲际弹道导弹（如果在战争中使用洲际弹道导弹，就会使世界上任何一个地区都处在受它的攻击的威胁之下）越来越多了。现存的局势要求联合国根据它所担负的任务作出新的努力来解决裁军问题和缔结有关协定或缔结各国之间的协定。联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会对裁军问题讨论了很多年，可是却没有达成各国之间的协议，原因之一就是只有很少的一部分国家（联合国裁军小组委员会中有五个联合国会员国，联合国裁军委员会中有十二个）参加裁军问题的讨论。因此有必要建立一个有广泛代表性的讨论裁军问题的机构，以便使所有国家都能够积极参加讨论裁军问题。同时使常设裁军委员会的活动公开，这样就可以使裁军问题成为各国人民注意的焦点，使各国人民完全了解谈判的情况和各国的立场。
    建议说，成立常设裁军委员会，并不排斥各别国家之间或是一些国家之间讨论各种裁军问题的可能性。相反的，这种讨论只会扩大各国间的协商、会谈等接触方式。
