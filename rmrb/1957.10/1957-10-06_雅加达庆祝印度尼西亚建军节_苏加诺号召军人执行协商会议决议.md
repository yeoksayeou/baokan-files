Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 5th: A grand parade was held in Jakarta this morning to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian National Armed Forces.

President Sukarno, accompanied by Prime Minister and Defense Minister Djuanda and the Chiefs of Staff of the three armed services, reviewed the army, navy, and air force troops. A squadron of bombers and jets flew over Jakarta, receiving the review.

After the review, President Sukarno issued an order. He called on the soldiers to implement the resolutions of the National Consultative Assembly and the future decisions of the seven-person committee handling army affairs. President Sukarno reiterated the speech he gave twelve years ago, urging the soldiers to abide by the constitution and not to interfere in politics.

Army Chief of Staff Nasution also issued a message today. He urged the soldiers to be vigilant, as there are people at home and abroad who are attempting to exploit Indonesia's internal disputes to create disturbances.

The Indonesian Republican Army was officially established on October 5, 1945, initially called the People's Sovereignty Army, later renamed the Indonesian People's Army, and finally reorganized into the current Indonesian National Armed Forces.

    雅加达庆祝印度尼西亚建军节
    苏加诺号召军人执行协商会议决议
    据新华社雅加达5日电　今天早上，雅加达隆重地举行了庆祝印度尼西亚国家军队建军十二周年的阅兵典礼。
    苏加诺总统在朱安达总理兼国防部长和三军参谋长陪同下检阅了陆、海、空军部队。一队轰炸机和喷气机飞临雅加达市上空，接受了检阅。
    苏加诺总统在检阅完毕后发布了命令。他号召军人们执行全国协商会议的决议和处理军队问题的七人委员会将来作出的决定。苏加诺总统重提他在十二年前发表的演说，要军人们遵守宪法，不过问政治。
    陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安也在今天发表了文告。他要军人们提高警惕，因为国内外有人企图利用印度尼西亚内部的争端来进行扰乱。
    印度尼西亚共和国军队正式建立于1945年10月5日，最初称为人民主权军，后来改为印度尼西亚人民军，最后改编为现在的印度尼西亚国家军队。
