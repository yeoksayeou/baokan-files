    The situation in the Middle East has become serious. World peace is threatened. This danger arises from the doctrine of power vacuum—a policy openly declared to interfere in the affairs of the countries of this region, a policy that violates their independence and sovereignty.
    Powerful land, sea, and air forces have been assembled on Syria's borders and coasts, threatening Syria's national independence. The threats issued to the Syrian government and the encouragement of subversive activities have created an atmosphere of psychological warfare. If this threat turns into actual military intervention, it could lead to a world war due to a chain reaction, thus bringing tragic consequences to all mankind.
    A year ago, similar events led to an attack on Egypt, in which a global disaster of a full-scale war was narrowly avoided. Thanks to the actions of the forces of peace, the aggression against Egypt was thwarted, and the expansion of hostilities was prevented. Today, throughout the Middle East and elsewhere, public opinion is rising up against a new aggression.
    We call on all peace-loving people around the world to speak out in unison to prevent the outbreak of hostilities. Interference and pressure must end, Syria's independence and sovereignty must be guaranteed, and world peace must be saved.

    关于叙利亚遭受威胁的宣言
    中东已经出现了严重的局势。世界和平受到了威胁。这种危险产生于力量真空的学说——这是一种公开宣布的干涉这一地区各国事务的政策，是一种侵犯它们的独立和主权的政策。
    在叙利亚的边境和海岸上已经集结了强大的陆、海、空军部队，威胁着叙利亚的民族独立。对叙利亚政府发出的威胁以及对颠覆活动的鼓励已经造成了一种神经战的气氛。这种威胁如果变成实际军事干涉，是可以由于连锁反应而导致世界大战从而给全体人类带来悲惨后果的。
    一年以前，类似的事件导致了一次对埃及的进攻，在这次进攻中一场全面战争的世界性灾难好容易才得以避免。由于和平力量的行动，才挫败了对埃及的侵略，防止了敌对行动的扩大。今天，在整个中东以及所有其它地方，舆论正在起来反对一次新的侵略。
    我们号召全世界和平的拥护者同声疾呼来防止敌对行动的爆发。必须结束干涉和压力，必须保障叙利亚的独立和主权，必须挽救世界和平。
