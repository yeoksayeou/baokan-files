    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 8th: Leader of the French Republican Union for Social Progress, Pflimlin, accepted French President Coty's request on the morning of October 7th to find a way to end the government crisis.
    Pflimlin was invited to form a government after the failure of the Socialist leader Mollet's attempt to do so. The French government crisis has lasted for a week.
    Pflimlin stated that he would firmly advocate that all bourgeois parties, from socialists to conservatives, should fully participate in the government. He will also suggest that all bourgeois political parties stop internal infighting for one year to achieve the following four goals: resolving the Algerian issue; amending the constitution; balancing the budget; and implementing fiscal reform.
