Speech by Premier Zhou Enlai at the Banquet Welcoming Prime Minister Daoud

Your Excellency, Respected Prime Minister, Friends, Comrades:

　　I am pleased to represent the Chinese government and the Chinese people in welcoming His Excellency Sardar Mohammed Daoud, Prime Minister of the friendly Kingdom of Afghanistan, and the distinguished guests accompanying him, from our friendly neighbor. Prime Minister Daoud's friendly visit to our country brings with it the friendship of the Afghan people towards the Chinese people and the sincere desire to further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries. We feel very honored and happy. Please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to our esteemed guests.

　　For centuries, the Chinese and Afghan peoples have lived in harmony and have never experienced war or conflict. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the traditional friendship between our two countries has been extensively developed on a new basis. We formally established diplomatic relations in January 1955. In April of the same year, representatives of both countries attended the Bandung Conference, which was of great historical significance. The representatives of both countries made joint efforts for the success of this conference.

　　In the past two years, the governments of both countries have actively worked to further strengthen the friendly ties between the two countries. Our two countries have sent various delegations to each other for friendly visits. A trade agreement beneficial to the economic construction of both countries was also signed in July this year. In January this year, Vice Premier He Long and I paid a friendly visit to the Kingdom of Afghanistan and were warmly welcomed and received by His Excellency Sardar Mohammed Daoud, Prime Minister, the Afghan government, and the people. During our visit, the prime ministers of the two countries issued a joint communiqué, reaffirming the desire and determination to further develop friendly ties between the two countries. All of this has greatly helped to enhance the friendship and understanding between the two peoples. Today, we are very pleased to have the opportunity to meet our friend, Prime Minister, in Beijing. Prime Minister's visit to our country will undoubtedly make a new contribution to the further development of friendly relations between China and Afghanistan.

　　The Afghan people have waged a long and heroic struggle to safeguard their national independence and oppose imperialist aggression. Today, the Afghan people are making new efforts in safeguarding the cause of international peace and promoting the friendly unity of Asian and African countries. These have won the great respect of the Chinese people for the Afghan people. I would also like to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, my sincere gratitude to the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan for its firm support for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

　　Like the Afghan people, the Chinese people firmly safeguard independence, defend peace, and cherish friendship. We are willing to live in friendship with all countries willing to be friendly with our country on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Since the Bandung Conference in April 1955, the unity of Asian and African countries has been strengthened, the movement of Asian and African regions to strive for and safeguard national independence has reached a new upsurge, and colonialists have repeatedly suffered failures. All peace-loving people in the world are delighted and encouraged by this. However, the colonialists are not reconciled to their failure and are now continuing to create tension in the Middle East region. We believe that as long as the people of all countries in the Middle East region strengthen their unity, the colonialists will certainly continue to suffer failures.

　　Your Excellency, Prime Minister, since the founding of our country in 1949, after three years of recovery and five years of construction, the first Five-Year Plan will be completed by this year. Although we have made certain achievements in economic construction, there are still many difficulties and shortcomings. We hope that Your Excellency Prime Minister can give us valuable advice when you visit our construction work.

　　Your Excellency, Prime Minister, I hope you will have a very pleasant time during your visit to our country.

　　I propose a toast,

　　To the prosperity of the Kingdom of Afghanistan and the happiness of the Afghan people!

　　To the friendship between the peoples of China and Afghanistan!

　　To world and Asian peace!

　　To the health of His Excellency Sardar Mohammed Daoud, Prime Minister!

　　To the health of His Majesty King Mohammed Zahir!
　　Cheers!

### 在欢迎达乌德首相宴会上  周恩来总理的讲话

    在欢迎达乌德首相宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的首相殿下，朋友们，同志们：
    我以愉快的心情代表中国政府和中国人民，欢迎来自我国友好邻邦阿富汗王国的首相萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德殿下和随同前来的贵宾们。达乌德首相殿下来到我国进行友好访问，带来了阿富汗人民对中国人民的友谊和进一步加强两国友好关系的真诚愿望，我们感到十分荣幸和高兴。请允许我向我们尊贵的客人们表示衷心的感谢。
    中国人民和阿富汗人民，多少世纪以来，都是和睦共处，从来没有过战争和冲突。中华人民共和国成立以后，我们两国的传统友谊在新的基础上有了广泛的发展。1955年1月我们两国正式建立了外交关系。同年4月，我们两国的代表都出席了具有重大历史意义的万隆会议。两国代表为这一会议的成功做出了共同的努力。
    近两年来，两国政府都积极地致力于进一步加强两国的友好联系。我们两国曾经互相派遣各种代表团进行友好访问。今年7月还签订了有利于两国经济建设的贸易协定。今年1月我和贺龙副总理在阿富汗王国进行友好访问，受到萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德首相殿下，阿富汗政府和人民的热情欢迎和接待。在我们访问期间，两国总理发表了联合公报，重申进一步发展两国友好联系的愿望和决心。这一切都大大有助于增进两国人民的友谊和了解。今天我们非常高兴能够有机会在北京同我们的朋友首相殿下相会。首相殿下这次来我国访问，无疑地将为中阿两国友好关系的进一步开展作出新的贡献。
    阿富汗人民为了维护自己的民族独立和反对帝国主义的侵略，曾经作过长期的英勇斗争。今天，阿富汗人民在维护国际和平事业和促进亚非国家友好团结方面，正在进行新的努力。这些都赢得了中国人民对阿富汗人民极大的尊敬。我还愿意借这个机会代表中国政府和中国人民对阿富汗王国政府坚决支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位表示衷心的感谢。
    中国人民同阿富汗人民一样，坚决维护独立，保卫和平和珍视友谊。我们愿意和一切愿意同我国友好的国家在和平共处五项原则的基础上友好相处。自从1955年4月万隆会议以来，亚非各国的团结有了加强，亚非地区争取和维护民族独立的运动达到新的高涨，殖民主义者连续遭到了失败。对此，世界各国爱好和平的人民莫不感到欢欣鼓舞。但是，殖民主义者不甘心于他们的失败，现在正在继续制造中近东地区的紧张局势。我们相信，只要中近东地区各国人民加强自己的团结，殖民主义者将一定继续遭到失败。
    首相殿下，我国从1949年建国以来，经过三年的恢复和五年的建设，到今年为止，第一个五年计划即将完成，虽然我们在经济建设方面已经做出了一定的成绩，但是也还存在着许多困难和缺点，我们希望首相殿下在参观我们的建设工作的时候能给我们提出宝贵的意见。
    首相殿下，我希望你在我国访问期间将会感到十分愉快。
    我提议
    为阿富汗王国的繁荣和阿富汗人民的幸福，
    为中阿两国人民的友谊，
    为世界和亚洲和平，
    为萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德首相殿下的健康，
    为穆罕默德·查希尔国王陛下的健康，
      干杯！
