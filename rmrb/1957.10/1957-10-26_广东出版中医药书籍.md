Guangdong Publishes Books on Traditional Chinese Medicine

    Guangdong People's Publishing House has recently published several new books on traditional Chinese medicine. Among them, "A Collection of Guangdong Traditional Chinese Medicine Proven Prescriptions for Exchange" (compiled by the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Traditional Chinese Medicine Research) collects more than 1,000 traditional Chinese medicine proven prescriptions, which mostly list inexpensive and easily obtainable drugs with simple preparation and usage methods.
    In addition, "Synopsis of the Golden Chamber" (posthumous work of the late traditional Chinese medicine doctor Li Yunqing), "Treatment of Common Gynecological Diseases with Traditional Chinese Medicine" (co-authored by Luo Yuankai and Deng Tietao), and other books have also been published.
