Talking About Sweet Potatoes

　　Walking through the streets and alleys these days, one often smells a fragrant, sweet aroma. Paying attention, one finds that the aroma comes from a steaming stall by the roadside, or from the misty kitchen of someone's home with an open window, where sweet potatoes are being roasted or boiled.

　　Sweet potato is what Beijingers call it; Shanghainese call it sweet potato [shan yu]. It also has names like sweet potato, red potato, and sweet potato. But these are all its aliases; its scientific name is Ipomoea batatas.

　　What about its nutritional value?

　　Whether from the preferences and habits of the Chinese people, or from the quantity and variety of grain production in our country, sweet potatoes have long become one of the indispensable staple foods of the Chinese people. It is delicious and inexpensive, which is already well known. But is it nutritious and easy to digest? People are generally not very clear about this. Here is a table: (See attached table)

　　Nutrient content of sweet potatoes (per 100 grams)

　　After analysis and comparison, we know that: (1) Sweet potatoes are richer in minerals and vitamins than rice and flour. In particular, the carotene (which vitamin A is made from) and ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which are not found in rice and flour, have contents (the former refers to red-fleshed sweet potatoes) that even exceed those of ordinary vegetables and fruits. (2) Sweet potatoes have higher carbohydrates and calories than ordinary tubers, beans, and vegetables, but less than rice and flour. Approximately three catties and more of sweet potatoes have the caloric value of one catty of rice. (3) Although the protein content of sweet potatoes is less than that of rice and flour (approximately four catties of sweet potatoes are equivalent to one catty of rice), the lysine (an essential amino acid for the human body) contained in its protein is much higher than that of rice and flour. Eating them together can make up for deficiencies. (4) The fiber content of sweet potatoes is lower than that of coarse grains, so they are easy to digest.

   Introducing several ways to eat them

    Here are a few simple mixed eating methods:

    (1) Sweet Potato Porridge, Sweet Potato Rice: Wash and cut the sweet potato into small pieces or shreds, and cook it with rice, but add it slightly later than the rice. When making rice, you can add one-third sweet potato (add less water), and when making porridge, you can add about one-quarter.

    (2) Making Steamed Buns: Steam (boil) the sweet potatoes until cooked, peel them, and mash them into a puree. Then add dry flour and mix well, then add yeast. Generally, 30-50% sweet potatoes can be used to replace flour (it is said that you can mix even more sweet potatoes, everyone can experiment). This kind of steamed bun is soft, fluffy, and sweet.

    (3) Various Desserts: (Applicable to the industry, any dessert made with flour or with flour as the crust can use about one-third sweet potato to replace flour.) The method is roughly the same as making steamed buns, such as dumplings, crispy turnovers, sesame seed cakes, eight-treasure rice, large and small mooncakes, sweet potato cakes, chestnut cakes, five-color cakes, home-style pancakes, large pancakes, bean paste cakes, bean paste buns, etc., can all be made. Bean paste can also use sweet potato instead of red beans.

    In addition, cutting sweet potatoes into slices, drying them in the sun, and grinding them into powder is not only convenient for storage but also convenient for mixing with flour at any time to make noodles, pancakes, steamed buns, and various desserts. It can also be used as a substitute for water chestnut flour.

    A major drawback of tubers is that they have too much gas-producing enzyme, which will produce carbon dioxide in the digestive tract, making people feel a little bloated. The more thoroughly they are boiled or roasted, the more enzymes are destroyed; if they are fried, deep-fried, or stir-fried, the destruction of enzymes is less, and they are more likely to cause bloating.

    When making sweet potatoes, it is important to note that, whether roasting or boiling, do not peel them. When eating after they are cooked, even if you don’t eat the skin, you can still preserve more of the internal nutrients, because the outer skin contains more nutrients than the inner part.

    How to store and preserve them?

    There are two preservation methods: one is to dig a cellar to store them, which is not suitable for cities; the other is to wash the sweet potatoes, cut them into thin slices, and dry them into dried sweet potatoes, which is a method that cities can try. For urban residents with small quantities, they can generally be placed in a ventilated place (without damaging the skin), as long as they are kept dry. For canteens and industries that store large quantities, wooden boards can be raised (preferably with warehouse boards) and placed flat, with some dried yellow sand placed on the wooden boards, and the sweet potatoes are piled loosely on top of the yellow sand. Or they can be placed in bamboo baskets and then piled up, with ventilation on all sides for easy inspection. If any are found to be moldy, they should be picked out and isolated immediately.

### 谈谈白薯

　　谈谈白薯
    这几天早晨在大街小巷走走，常常会闻到一阵阵扑鼻的甜香。留神看看，原来那香味是从路旁一个热腾腾的小摊，或是从谁家开着窗的热雾弥漫的厨房里飘散出来的，那儿正在烤白薯或是煮白薯。
    白薯，是北京人的叫法；上海人叫它山芋。它又有番薯、红薯、甜薯等称呼。但这都是它的字或号，它的学名是甘薯。
    营养价值怎样？
    无论从我国人民的喜好和习惯、或是从我国粮食生产的数量和品种上来说，白薯早已成为我国人民不可缺少的主食品之一了。它，味美价廉，已为人所共知。但它是不是富有营养，好不好消化？人们一般不太了然。这里有一张表：（附图表）
　　白薯各种营养成分（每百克）含量
    据分析、比较后知道：（一）白薯的矿物质和维生素比大米、面粉丰富。特别是米、面中没有的胡萝卜素（维生素甲就是它变成的）和抗坏血酸（维生素丙）二项，含量（前者指红心白薯而言）还超过一般蔬菜、水果。（二）白薯的糖类和发热量高于一般薯类、豆类、菜类，但比米、面少。大约三斤多白薯的热量可抵一斤大米。（三）白薯的蛋白质含量虽比米、面少（大约也是四斤白薯抵一斤大米），但它所含蛋白质中的赖氨酸（人体所必需的一种氨基酸）远较米、面高。混合食用，可以补充不足。（四）白薯所含纤维质低于粗粮，所以人吃了容易消化。
   介绍几种吃法
    这里介绍几种简单的混合吃法：
    （一）白薯粥、白薯饭：将白薯洗干净切成小块或丝，同米一起煮，但比米稍后下锅。做饭时可放三分之一白薯（少放些水），做粥可放四分之一左右。
    （二）做馒头：将白薯蒸（煮）熟，去皮捣成泥浆，然后加干面粉调匀，再放发酵粉，一般可以30—50％白薯代面粉（据说还可更多搭一些白薯，大家可以试验）。这种馒头又松又软又甜。
    （三）各式点心：（适用于行业，凡是以面粉做的点心或以面粉做皮子，均可用白薯三分之一左右代面粉。）做法与做馒头大体相同，如饺子、酥合子、麻酱饼、八宝饭、大小月饼、白薯糕、栗子糕、五色糕、家常饼、大饼、豆沙饼、豆沙大包等等均可做。豆沙也可以白薯代赤豆。
    此外，把白薯切成片，晒干后磨成粉，既便于放置，又便于随时掺面粉做面条、烙饼、馒头和各式点心吃，还可以代菱粉用。
    薯类的一个大缺点，是气化酶太多，在消化道中会产生二氧化碳，使人感到有些腹胀。煮或烤得越熟，酶被破坏就越多；如果用油煎、炸、炒，酶的破坏较少，吃了容易腹胀。
    做白薯时要注意的是：无论烤或煮，不要剥掉皮，熟后吃时，就是不吃皮，也能多保存一些内部养料，因为它的外皮部分含的养料比内心部分多。
    如何保管贮藏？
    保管方法有两种，一是挖地窖藏之，这不适合城市；二是将白薯洗干净切成薄片晒干变成甘薯干，这方法城市可以试用。城市居民用量少的，一般可以把它放在通风的地方（不要伤皮），只要保持干燥就行。伙食团、行业保管数量大的，可把木板垫高（最好用仓板）、放平，木板上稍放些已晒干的黄沙，白薯就散堆在黄沙上面。或以竹筐盛了，再堆起来，四面通风，便于检查。如果发现有霉烂的，应即拣出隔离。
