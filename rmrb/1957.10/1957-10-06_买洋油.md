    Buying Kerosene
    Recently, I went to the Neiliang mountainous area in Jicun, Jiangxi Province. At the Jicun Supply and Marketing Cooperative, I saw a group of children carrying bamboo oil containers to buy "kerosene."
    "Is there any kerosene for sale?" After the group of children left, a peasant woman came and asked. Director Liu of the Jicun Supply and Marketing Cooperative told me that before liberation, in the Neiliang mountainous area of Jicun, except for the landlords' families, poor peasants used to light "bamboo strips," and the poorest only had the "moon" for light.
    In recent years, the peasants here have abandoned "bamboo strips" and started using kerosene.
    In the past, they used the moon for light, now they use kerosene. In the face of this small mirror of life, what do the rightist gentlemen have to say?

    买洋油
    最近，我到江西省吉村内良山区去了一趟。在吉村供销社，我看到一群孩子手提着竹油筒买“洋油”。
    “有没有洋油卖？”一群孩子走后，又来了一个农妇问。吉村供销社刘主任告诉我，解放前吉村内良山区除了地主家以外，贫苦农民都是点“篾筋”（竹条子），更贫的只是点“月亮”。
    这几年，这里农民才丢了“篾筋”点洋油了。
    过去点月亮，现在点洋油，在这面小小的生活镜子面前，右派先生们，还有什么说的呢？
