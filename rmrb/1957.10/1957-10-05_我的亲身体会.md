    My Personal Experience
    Liu Yiru
    Many rightists, taking advantage of the Party's rectification campaign, maliciously slandered the great anti-Party clique movement, saying that the anti-Party clique movement was "a mess". I am an engineer at the Second Design Institute of the Second Ministry of Machine Building. During the anti-Party clique movement, I was one of the people under investigation. However, based on my personal experience, I want to say: the anti-Party clique movement was very good.
    Before liberation, I studied in high school and university in Chongqing. Kuomintang secret agents spread throughout the schools to sabotage student movements and persecute progressive students. A fellow townsman who was close to me at the time was carrying out covert secret agent activities among the students, but I didn't understand his situation, and I didn't explain it clearly to the organization after liberation. In addition, during the anti-Party clique movement, another anti-revolutionary element who was a university classmate and in custody framed me, saying that he had introduced me to join the Central Unification secret agent organization, and provided the time, place, and specific activities. Before these complex social relationships were clarified, anyone had reason to be suspicious. It was completely necessary for the organization to review my history. Like the local Party committees, the Party committee of our institute resolutely implemented the central government's policy of "raising vigilance, eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionary elements; preventing deviations, and never wronging a good person." On the one hand, it enthusiastically helped me, explained the policies to me, dispelled my worries, and asked me to explain in detail my relationship with the secret agents. On the other hand, it sent a group of responsible cadres who spent several thousand yuan on travel expenses, traveled all over most of China, to find my classmates at the time to investigate the truth. In order to find a corroborating witness, the comrades who were doing the investigation work often walked more than a hundred miles a day in the deep mountains of Sichuan, could not buy anything to eat, and were hungry all day long. In this way, my problem was clarified, a conclusion was reached based on facts, and the results of the review were announced at a general meeting of the institute. Think about it, which political party in history is so great, so selfless, and so realistic? If there were no anti-Party clique movement, I don't know when these complex social relationships would have been clarified. If under the Kuomintang reactionaries' murderous terror policy of rather killing a thousand by mistake than letting one go, how could such a thorough and meticulous investigation and study have been carried out? I'm afraid my head would have already fallen to the ground!
    After the anti-Party clique movement, the problems that had been bothering me for several years since I joined the revolutionary work were clarified, and I put down the heavy ideological burden. At the same time, the Party organization also cared more about me, helped me politically, and used me more boldly in my work. Therefore, I not only do not hate the Party at all, on the contrary, I am closer to the Party, love the Party more, and am determined to contribute more to the cause of socialist construction.

    我的亲身体会
    刘义儒
    许多右派分子，趁党整风的机会，对伟大的肃反运动，进行了恶毒的诬蔑，说肃反运动“搞糟了”。我是第二机械工业部第二设计院的工程师，肃反运动的时候，曾经是被审查对象之一。但是，根据我的亲身体验，我要说：肃反运动好得很。
    解放前我在重庆读高中、大学，国民党特务，散布学校各处进行破坏学生运动，迫害进步同学的罪恶活动。当时与我较密切的一个同乡，他在同学中进行隐蔽的特务活动，但我对他的情况不了解，解放后也没有向组织交代清楚。加以肃反运动期间，另一个大学时的同学、在押的反革命分子竟陷害我，说他介绍我参加过中统特务组织，并且有时间、有地点、有具体活动内容。这些复杂的社会关系，在未弄清楚之前，任何人都是有理由怀疑的。组织上审查我的历史，是完全必要的。跟各地党委一样，我院党委坚决贯彻了中央“提高警惕，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子；防止偏差，决不冤枉一个好人”的方针，一方面热心地帮助我，向我交代政策，打消顾虑，要我详细地交代与特务分子的关系。另一方面派出了一批负责干部，花了好几千元旅费，跑遍了大半个中国，去找我当时的同学调查真实情况。为了找到一个旁证人，作调查工作的同志在四川的深山中，往往一天步行百余里，买不到东西吃，整天挨饿。这样，才弄清楚了我的问题，实事求是的作出了结论，并在全院大会上宣布了审查的结果。请想想看，历史上有那个政党是这样伟大，这样大公无私，这样实事求是的？若是没有肃反运动，我这些复杂的社会关系，不知那年那月才弄得清楚。假如在国民党反动派那种宁愿错杀一千，不肯错放一个的杀人恐怖政策下，那能这样周密细致地进行调查研究呢？恐怕人头早已落地了吧！
    肃反运动以后，我参加革命工作几年来纠缠不清的问题弄清了，放下了沉重的思想包袱。同时，党组织也更加关怀我，在政治上帮助我，在工作上更加大胆使用我。所以，我不但一点不仇恨党，相反的，我更加靠近党，更加热爱党，并立志为社会主义建设事业，贡献出更多的力量。
