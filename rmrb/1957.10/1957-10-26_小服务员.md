    Little Waiter
    On Sunday, I went to see a movie. Two children were standing at the entrance of the cinema, reaching out to me and saying, "Comrade, please show me your ticket." I looked down and saw a piece of red cloth wrapped around their arms, with the words "Ticket Inspector" written on it. I realized they were the ticket inspectors. When I entered, the movie had already started, and it was dark inside. At this moment, a child of about twelve or thirteen years old took the ticket from my hand, used a flashlight to light the way, and slowly led me to my seat. After I was seated, he left.
    After watching the movie, I went to the cooperative restaurant to eat noodles. As soon as I bought the meal ticket, a little boy wearing a red scarf arranged a seat for me, poured a glass of water, and took the meal ticket from my hand. In a little while, he brought the noodles. I saw that he was also busy cleaning up other tables. He was truly a very competent little waiter. There were several children like him in the restaurant. I asked one of the little waiters, "Are you students?" The little waiter smiled and said, "We are junior high school students. We come here in shifts on Sundays for voluntary labor."

    小服务员
    星期日，去看电影。电影院门口站着两个孩子，伸手向我说：“同志，请把票拿给我看。”我低头看见他们胳膊上缠着一块红布，上写“验票员”三字，才知道他们是验票的。入场时，电影已开映了，场内一片漆黑。这时，一个年约十二、三岁的孩子，从我手中接过票去，用电筒照路，慢慢把我带到座位旁，看我入了座，才走开。
    看完电影，到合作餐厅去吃面，刚买好饭票，一个带着红领巾的小男孩，给我安置了座，倒来一杯开水，从我手中拿走了饭票。一会儿，端了面来，我看到他还忙着收拾别的桌子，真是一个很称职的小服务员。像他这样大的孩子，餐厅中还有好几个，我问一个小服务员说：“你们是不是学生？”小服务员笑了一笑说：“我们是初中学生，星期日分批到这里来义务劳动。”（重庆　晓泉）
