    Transistor Amplifier
    Yu Wenke, a technician at the Tianjin Joint State-Private Zhenmei Electric Factory, successfully developed a transistor amplifier that works with both AC and DC power and does not use vacuum tubes. This amplifier is very small, weighing only one or two pounds. It can transmit speech and play records. It is simple to use, energy-saving, durable, and inexpensive, making it suitable for both rural and urban areas. The picture above shows Yu Wenke (right) testing this amplifier.　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Tian Ming Photo

    Semiconductor Generator
    Harbin State-Owned Longjiang Electric Factory has begun producing the Model 901 semiconductor generator.
    This generator is modeled after the Soviet ТЭГК2-2 semiconductor generator. It uses the heat generated by a kerosene lamp during lighting to convert it into electricity, which can replace dry batteries as a power supply for DC radios. It is suitable for domestic "Zuguo" brand and "Changjiang" brand radios, as well as Soviet radios such as "Zuguo-47," "Zuguo-52," "Mars," and "Tallinn." Its semiconductor device can last for 8,000 hours, and can be replaced when it wears out. Kerosene consumption is only 1.4-2.4 liang (50-85 grams) per hour, and the brightness is about the same as a 20-watt light bulb.

    Latest Marine Chronometer
    Yantai Clock Factory in Shandong Province successfully imitated the world's most advanced marine chronometer produced by the Soviet Chesboure Clock Factory—the "10-1" marine chronometer.
    This marine chronometer is made of highly moisture-resistant materials, making it moisture-proof, rust-proof, and shock-resistant, suitable for use on ships and warships.

    Pig Fattening Powder
    Tianjin No. 1 Pesticide Production Cooperative has successfully developed a pig fattening powder that saves feed and accelerates pig growth.
    Pig fattening powder is methylthiouracil, synthesized from four raw materials: sodium, alcohol, thiourea, and ethyl acetate, and it inhibits thyroid metabolism.

    不用电子管的扩音机
    天津公私合营真美电机厂技术员于文科试制交、直流不用电子管的扩音机成功。这种扩音机的体积很小，仅重一、二斤，能送话，也能播放唱片，使用简便，省电耐用，价格便宜，在农村和城市都很适用。上图是于文科（右）在试用这种扩音机。　新华社记者　田明摄
    半导体发电器
    哈尔滨市国营龙江电工厂开始生产901型半导体发电器。
    这种发电器是仿照苏联ТЭГК2—2型半导体发电器制成的，利用煤油灯在照明时产生的热能变成电能，可以代替干电池供给直流收音机作电源。国产祖国牌、长江牌收音机和苏联的祖国—47、祖国—52、火星、塔林等型收音机都可适用。它的半导体器件可以用八千小时，用坏还可以换。煤油消耗量每小时1.4—2.4市两就够了，照明度和一个二十瓦的电灯泡差不多。

    最新式的航运钟
    山东烟台造钟厂仿造苏联切斯堡列造钟厂生产的世界上最先进的航运钟——“10—1”航运钟成功。
    这种航运钟是用耐湿性很高的材料制成的，能够防湿、防锈、防止震动，适合在轮船、军舰上使用。
    肥猪粉
    天津市第一农药生产合作社，试制成功一种既节约饲料又可加速生猪成长的肥猪粉。
    肥猪粉是用钠、酒精、硫脲、乙烯乙酸乙酯四种原料化合成的甲基硫氧嘧啶，具有抑制甲状腺新陈代谢的作用。
