　　Talking About Water Polo
　　Wang Guanying
    Water polo has a history of several decades. In 1870, some European countries had already started playing water polo, but this activity was only present in a few countries. Since the Fifth Olympic Games in 1912 listed water polo as a competition event, water polo has been developed in more countries.
    Playing water polo is an interesting team game; it requires not only individual skills but also teamwork. Because it is played in the water, it has different characteristics from other ball sports: one must know how to swim. Water polo players generally need to be familiar with freestyle and breaststroke, and sometimes backstroke is also required, which demands good physical strength, endurance, and speed. Regularly participating in water polo is very beneficial for physical health, all-round development, and swimming skills.
    Our country has superior natural conditions, a long coastline, and rivers or lakes everywhere, making it easy to conduct water polo activities in many places. However, water polo is still a young sport in our country. This is because the Kuomintang reactionary government did not pay attention to sports before liberation, and water polo, like other sports, was not developed. Not to mention national competitions, even playing water polo was rarely seen. After liberation, thanks to the care of the Party and the People's Government for sports, water polo in our country has gradually developed and has become one of the sports included in the national competition system. Three water polo competitions were held in 1955, 1956, and April this year, which played a significant role in promoting the development of water polo in various places. The number of people participating in water polo is increasing day by day. According to incomplete statistics from five cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Xiamen, there were only fifteen water polo teams in 1955, which increased to seventy-eight teams in 1956, and has now grown to one hundred and sixty-eight teams. This number shows that water polo in our country is flourishing.
    With the development of water polo, our water polo players have basically mastered some complex advanced movements and are proficient in some new tactics. However, the current level of water polo technology in our country is still far behind the world level. We need to vigorously develop this sport and strive to improve our technology, and learn from countries with advanced levels in water polo, especially from the Soviet Union.
    The purpose of holding the National Water Polo Championships this time is, on the one hand, to review the strength of water polo in our country through this competition, and more importantly, to further promote the widespread development of water polo in our country through this competition.

　　谈谈水球运动
　　王冠英
    水球运动已经有几十年的历史了。1870年时，欧洲有些国家已经开始打水球，但只是在少数国家里有这种活动。自1912年第五届奥林匹克运动会把水球列为比赛项目之一以后，水球运动才在更多的国家里开展起来。
    打水球，是一项饶有兴趣的集体游戏；不仅要有个人技术，而且还要集体配合。因为它是在水中进行的，所以又具有和其他球类不同的特点：就是要会游泳。水球运动员一般都要熟悉自由泳和蛙泳，有时还需要仰泳，这必须有很好的体力、耐力和速度。经常参加水球运动，对于身体的健康、全面发展和游泳技术都有很大的好处。
    我国的自然条件优越，海岸线很长，到处有江河或湖泊，便于进行水球活动的地方很多。但是，水球运动在我国还是一个年轻的运动项目。这是因为在解放前国民党反动政府对体育的不重视，水球和其他运动项目一样没有得到开展。不用说全国性的比赛，就是打水球也很少见到。解放后，由于党和人民政府对体育运动的关怀，水球运动在我国才逐步有了发展，并已成为国家竞赛制度中开展项目之一。1955年、1956年和今年4月曾先后举行过三次水球比赛，这些比赛对推动各地水球运动的开展起了不小的作用。各地参加水球运动的人日益增多。据上海、广州、天津、重庆、厦门等五个城市的不完全统计，在1955年只有十五个水球队，1956年增加到七十八个队，到目前为止已经发展到一百六十八个队了。这个数字说明我国的水球运动正在蓬勃发展。
    随着水球运动的开展，我国水球运动员已基本上掌握了一些复杂的高级动作和熟练了一些新的打法。但是，目前我国的水球技术水平与世界水平相差还远，我们需要大力开展这项运动和努力提高技术，并向在水球方面具有先进水平的国家学习，特别是向苏联学习。
    这次举行全国水球锦标赛，一方面是为了通过这次比赛来检阅一下我国水球方面的力量，而更重要的是通过这次比赛，更进一步推动水球运动在我国广泛开展起来。
