    The October Socialist Revolution and the Struggle of Mankind for Peace and Progress
    Song Qingling

    I

    Peace and progress have always been the most sacred causes pursued by mankind. The history of mankind is a record of the human struggle for these things.

    History is a continuous process. One era is connected to the next by two persistent threads that run through them. These two threads are the continuous human effort to conquer nature and make it serve them; the relentless struggle of mankind against backwardness, against the status quo of each era, and against oppressors.

    The past gave birth to the present, but in the midst of life's struggles, the structure of each era has its qualitative differences. The long-term goals of peace and progress are consistent, but the content of each specific era has its own characteristics, reflecting the degree to which mankind conquers nature and the social progress they have achieved.

    Each step forward is the result of mankind solving some important problem. We say that history has reached a "turning point." Each stage of human historical development advances along its path and reaches its end; from the crisis that follows, the environment of the new stage is generated. Mankind, the creator of history, first understands their constantly changing environment, and then creates economic, political, and social relationships that are suitable for this new environment. Thus, history begins a new cycle again, but at a higher level. Human abilities are enhanced once again, proving their capacity for unlimited development.

    History is also a process of chain reactions. Changes do not happen everywhere simultaneously. Rather, due to various historical reasons, changes occur in one or several places first. Then, after the new form shows its superiority over the existing forms, it is adopted by other places and becomes their own belief. This partly explains the unevenness of human development. In previous eras, such changes sometimes took hundreds of years to spread around the world because of the low level of civilization. But in the current era, such changes occur within a few decades and have a huge impact on vast areas. Although in every era and in every place there will be some people who, due to a lack of understanding or to protect their vested interests, attempt to obstruct, avoid, or prevent these changes from happening, history shows that such attempts are useless. Change is inevitable. It applies to all forms of society. Its arrival is unchangeable.

    History will continue to unfold its chapters in this way until mankind eliminates all oppression and universally and permanently recognizes the bonds of friendship. At that time, lasting peace will be achieved among the peoples of all countries. At that time, the main content of history will be the collective struggle of mankind against nature, raising human control over nature to the highest possible point. The essence of life will be the endless pursuit of greater progress.

    II

    Forty years ago, in the dark Tsarist Russia, the Soviet Communist Party led the great October Socialist Revolution to victory. We have every reason to call it a "turning point" in history. Because in human history there is clearly no other event that can compare with it in significance. It was a decisive breakthrough, a thunderclap of progress, that shook the world and, since those historic ten days, has been determining the direction of the world.

    The road of mankind towards peace and progress is long and tortuous. Until now, class oppression has been the hallmark of every society, and there have been many protests, uprisings, and revolutions against class oppression. However, none of them were able to bring about a fundamental change that would bring about a completely new type of society, a society where the people would not suffer—namely, the abolition of private ownership of the means of production. Only the October Socialist Revolution did this. This is what distinguishes the October Socialist Revolution from all the heroic efforts that preceded it and led to its occurrence.

    It was this earth-shattering great event that eliminated class and national oppression in the Soviet Union, prohibited all forms of exploitation, and for the first time treated men and women, all races and nationalities equally. On this socialist foundation, the first truly democratic country in history was established, a country firmly rooted among the ordinary working people who make up the overwhelming majority of the population, and whose sole purpose is to realize their desire for progress. At the same time, on the international stage, there also appeared for the first time a country that did not have a profit-seeking class politically and economically keen on war, and therefore yearned for peace and was willing to live in peace with all countries based on the principle of peaceful coexistence declared by Lenin.

    The October Socialist Revolution was indeed a great victory for mankind. It was a brilliant demonstration of the great Lenin's creative application of the scientific thought of Marxism to the era of imperialism. Thanks to the genius of Marx and Lenin, the world knew that the natural and social forces around us can be understood and can be used to fight for the liberation of a nation. In the forty years since then, the progress of the Soviet Union has shown that we humans can exert our will on these forces and make them produce the results we desire. This irrefutably proves that mankind can become the master of their environment.

    Regarding this point, what greater proof do we need than the Soviet Union's recent announcement of the launch of the first artificial satellite? This absolutely astonishing achievement of Soviet scientists tells us that mankind has almost stepped onto the threshold of a completely new track of development. Based on the general development of Soviet science and education, based on the great achievements in the peaceful application of atomic energy and jet propulsion aviation, as well as in automation and construction, this recent great achievement demonstrates the strength of socialist society and its superiority over any other form of society in developing science to serve peace and human progress. What a glorious symbol of the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution!

    Since October 1917, the most advanced elements of mankind, based on Marxism-Leninism, have challenged the rule of capitalism, colonialism, and feudalism on every continent. In these forty years, Marxism-Leninism has been accepted by the broad masses, and it has often inspired entire nations to launch a final offensive against backwardness and the inequality that has meant the enslavement of the people for thousands of years. This change will be realized all over the world, and this is inevitable. Mankind's advance towards socialism is unchangeable.

    III

    The October Socialist Revolution marked the death of an era, namely the death of the era of imperialism and colonial empires. These empires included most of the earth's area, population, and wealth, and it is understandable why even prominent bourgeois political commentators like Lippmann said that this death was "...a great historical phenomenon of the twentieth century." Indeed, it is, because the main obstacle hindering this large part of mankind from moving towards peace and progress has now been permanently removed.

    As Lenin said, the October Socialist Revolution broke through the chains of imperialism at its weakest link. This triggered an accelerating reaction in Asia and Africa, namely a disintegration process that gradually eroded the heart of imperialism.

    After October 1917, the East was never the same. The Soviet Union's defeat of the counter-revolutionary armies and the armies of the imperialist countries that intervened proved that although these armies appeared powerful, they could be defeated. The power of the people united to fight for a just cause has proven to be far greater than the sum of any forces that attempt to hinder the progress of history.

    This gave new courage and spirit to the national independence movements throughout Asia and Africa. After World War II, the anti-colonial wave rose to such an extent that in the following decade, 1.3 billion people in Asia and Africa freed themselves from imperialist rule.

    The Soviet state was the first and, for many years, the only major power in history to stand on the side of the enslaved nations. Similarly, after these nations gained independence, the Soviet Union, on the one hand, regarded their sovereignty and integrity as sacred and inviolable, and on the other hand, was always willing to extend a helping hand to help them accelerate their efforts to reach modern cultural and economic levels.

    On this point, the Soviet Union itself has become an inspiring force. Under the leadership of their great Communist Party, the peoples of the Soviet Union overcame immense difficulties and transformed their country from a backward state into one of the world's leading industrial powers. They achieved this in just a few decades, eighteen of which had to be spent protecting the Soviet homeland from enemies and repairing the damage of war.

    This great effort illustrates how great the potential talent and strength of the people is, especially when they are organized to struggle and work for the great socialist ideals. The heroic deeds of the peoples of the Soviet Union have left a deep impression on the minds of millions of people around the world who have problems of a similar nature and scope.

    The October Socialist Revolution and the proven superiority of the socialist system have had a profound impact on the Chinese people. The sound of the cannons of October 1917 brought us Marxism-Leninism. From this arose the Chinese Communist Party and the hope for the victory of the Chinese democratic revolution. The rapid development of the Soviet state inspired all those who sincerely hoped for the progress of China. When they saw the Soviet Union quickly and effectively solve its own economic and political problems, they realized that if China as a nation wanted to continue to survive, it could only choose socialism and not capitalism.

    "...With the Russian Revolution, a great hope was born for mankind." This is Sun Yat-sen's assessment of the October Socialist Revolution. We all know how excited he was when he heard the news that world imperialism had suffered a "devastating blow." Sun Yat-sen knew that this event would cause repercussions in China and the world. He closely watched the dynamics of the Soviet government and studied its various policies and methods. Although due to the great distance between the two, it was inconvenient to communicate, he could not communicate with Lenin as often as he hoped, but he understood the preciousness of this great and fearless revolutionary. I still remember how deeply grieved he was when he heard the news of Lenin's death. But his belief in the Communist Party left by Lenin was unshakable, and he said that this would guarantee that Lenin's ideals and plans could be victoriously realized.

    Sun Yat-sen learned from the October Socialist Revolution, and other revolutionaries in China also learned from this revolution. This enabled them to unite the broad masses of workers, peasants, students, and other democratic forces under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party, the most resolute anti-imperialist and anti-feudal party. This was an extremely valuable lesson that henceforth determined the path of the Chinese revolution.

    The Chinese people initially learned about proletarian internationalism from the actions of the Soviet state. Our country had encountered the fate of being divided into "spheres of influence" by imperialist powers, and our people became "second-class" citizens in their own country. Therefore, when the Soviet Union treated us equally without any racial discrimination, we learned a vivid lesson politically. This specific example especially caused many Chinese intellectuals to abandon their original illusions and their hope of achieving independence and freedom by uniting with imperialist countries. This example told them that only a socialist country like the Soviet Union sincerely hoped that they would win in their struggle to achieve national aspirations.

    The Soviet Union's initial declaration to the Chinese people, the abolition of the unequal treaties imposed on China by Tsarist Russia, and the active support given to China's struggle for liberation were all extremely important to the struggle at that time.

    Throughout the most difficult years of the Chinese revolution, the Soviet government and people have maintained this concern. This was a constant source of encouragement for our revolutionary fighters. The example of October 1917 was always before them. They knew that even at the moment when they encountered the most serious difficulties, the Soviet Union was building socialism. This made them believe that they themselves would achieve victory and that one day China would also establish socialism.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people achieved their own victory in 1949. This was an extraordinarily significant event. This was the second "devastating blow" to world imperialism. It connected the Soviet Union and China into a vast expanse of land, and together with the emerging people's democratic countries, it formed the world's socialist part for the first time, forming a powerful fortress of peace and progress. Together with the nationalist victories of other Asian and African countries, it showed that the process triggered by the October Socialist Revolution now has such a huge forward momentum that nothing can stop it, and history is advancing along its unchangeable path.

    In fact, a new and huge political force has emerged in the East. It speaks primarily for Asia and Africa, but its speech is also authoritative and influential in world affairs. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence demonstrate the lofty moral nature of this force; the historic Bandung Conference demonstrates its wide scope. This has brought about a most meaningful change in the overall balance of power in the world.

    Increasing evidence shows that on world and regional issues, the differences between the views of Asian and African countries and the views of imperialists are widening. On the other hand, there is also much evidence that the relationship between Asian and African countries and the world socialist part headed by the Soviet Union is becoming closer. This is because their views are very close on issues of peace, equality among countries and nations, and friendly cooperation between countries.

    The consistency of these three huge regions and populations on the above-mentioned issues has produced a political phenomenon in international life that has never existed before: the emergence of a region of peace and friendship, which includes countries with different systems on three continents, with close political, economic, and cultural relations. This cooperation has played a favorable role in the progress of hundreds of millions of Asian and African people in their national construction. It defends their independence and sovereignty, as the situation in Egypt and Syria proves. It represents the majority of mankind and gives significant content to the notion that a major war is not inevitable in today's world.

    Here we can see that the desire of mankind for peace and progress, as expressed in the present era through the unity and interaction of the socialist cause and the cause of national independence, has become the most powerful political idea on the world stage, as the past shows.

    IV

    The ideas that drove the October Socialist Revolution—the truth of Marxism-Leninism—are aimed at change. This idea is the first thing created by mankind that truly brings hope for rearranging the order of things, rearranging the order of things in order to create lasting world peace and enable mankind to achieve unlimited progress.

    The principles of Marxism-Leninism are universal. They are the key to liberation for all oppressed people everywhere. Therefore, the socialist movement has had its international aspect from the beginning; and the international solidarity of this movement has always been a major source of its strength. This was the case when there were only a few Marxists-Leninists in the world; and it is even more so today when their numbers have exceeded 30 million and one-third of the world has embarked on the path of socialism.

    At the beginning of this century, the development of the world situation was such that socialism first triumphed in the Soviet Union. Because of the serious struggles that were waged to achieve this victory and to build socialism, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the people gained extremely rich experience in applying Marxism-Leninism. This is a fact that every objective progressive has long recognized.

    History determined that the Soviet Union should become the center of the world working-class movement. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people understand this historical requirement, and they regard it as a great honor and responsibility. They understand that their actions and leadership will make the world understand the meaning of proletarian internationalism. The historical record of the past forty years shows that this major responsibility has been entrusted to reliable people. The contributions that have been made have greatly helped to liberate hundreds of millions of people from imperialist and capitalist enslavement.

    Not long ago, some people were accustomed to forgetting this period of history. They one-sidedly overemphasized certain mistakes, while intentionally or unintentionally ignoring the roots of those mistakes and the objective conditions that caused those mistakes, such as the fact that the international working-class movement and its internal relations were historically new.

    The world reactionaries are good at seizing anything that is beneficial to them, especially in their relentless struggle against socialist ideology and the working-class movement. Today, it finds the above-mentioned trends to be very beneficial to it.

    Let us take a comprehensive look at this situation.

    Now, no one can deny the achievements of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, nor can they deny the collapse of the colonialist system. But this has not stopped fools from dreaming. The world reactionaries centered on the American aggressive bloc stubbornly cling to their illusions, believing that all the major changes that have taken place in the past half-century are temporary, and its "philosophers" have come to the conclusion that the socialist system is merely a "temporary phenomenon" and that nationalist countries will sooner or later succumb to the omnipotent dollar.

    Naturally, these "philosophers" still dream of recovering their "lost territories" through a fierce blow from military force. However, they are somewhat restrained because they realize that they no longer have the overwhelming advantage of power necessary to carry out such a military adventure. Others have the same strength as them, if not greater than them. Thus, because world public opinion demands peaceful coexistence and friendship among all countries, rashly using military force will cause a complete political collapse.

    Since the military path is a dead end, these "philosophers" want to "attack from within." In order to do this, they have had to raise their activities to a higher level, to the realm of political ideology. In order to exaggerate the facts in every possible way, they have exaggerated the wavering of a few people in the working-class movement into a widespread phenomenon. In order to achieve this goal, they fabricated so-called "national communism." They cleverly created this term, which on the surface does not seem to question the superiority of communism over capitalism, but actually casts doubt on this point because it suggests that communism in various countries should be fundamentally different. In fact, this is an attack on Marxism-Leninism, which serves as a guide for the people's struggle to seize power and build socialism; it is also an attempt to strike at the Soviet Union's leading position in the socialist camp.

    First, this claim attempts to distort Marxism-Leninism and wants to make it a rigid dogma. This is an attempt to revive revisionism, thereby splitting the socialist camp and the ranks of the working-class movement. It attempts to blur true Marxism-Leninism, which believes that some of its principles apply to the situation in every country, while at the same time requiring that the national conditions, interests, and feelings of each country be taken into consideration.

    Second, this claim attempts to separate other socialist countries from the Soviet Union, thereby undermining the heart of the international socialist movement, its great unity. This is an imperialist trick, "divide and conquer," isolating countries and nations, so that once they lose the strength gained through unity, they are individually no match for imperialist forces. This is an attempt to use certain bourgeois nationalist tendencies that have been left over from the old society in various countries. This claim once again attempts to distort Marxism-Leninism, because the content of Marxism-Leninism includes both proletarian internationalism and the patriotism of the people of each country towards their own country.

    We have seen that the "philosophers" of the world reactionaries have been unhesitatingly using a large amount of subversive activities and armed counter-revolutionary rebellions to "highlight" their adventures in the field of political ideology, but we have also seen that the people can make rapid and decisive decisions to deal with these activities and rebellions.

    No matter what kind of offensive the world reactionaries launch against the socialist camp and the world working-class movement, no matter what name they use to disguise this offensive, their offensive will inevitably be defeated as it deserves. It is clear that all those who hope for peace and progress have a full responsibility to do so. We must make every possible and necessary effort to strengthen the international unity of the socialist movement centered on the Soviet Union on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. Because, in this way, and only in this way, is it in the greatest interest of the working people everywhere, in the greatest interest of those who are fighting for national independence, and in the greatest interest of the happiness of all mankind.

    The Chinese people are proud to be part of the vanguard of human progress, and they believe that maintaining and strengthening the unity of the international socialist movement is of the utmost importance. In our opinion, no effort is too great for this great cause. The first thing in this regard is our determination to persevere in our efforts to enhance Sino-Soviet friendship; this friendship has today become the unbreakable foundation of our cause. We will always stand shoulder to shoulder with our close friend, the Soviet Union! The road of the October Socialist Revolution is our road. This is the road of Marxism-Leninism. This is the hope of mankind!

    十月社会主义革命和人类争取和平和进步的斗争
    宋庆龄
    一
    和平和进步历来就是人类所追求的最神圣的事业。人类的历史就是人类追求这些东西的斗争的纪录。
    历史是一个连续的过程。一个时代同下一个时代是由两条贯穿其间的持续的线索联系着的。这两条线索就是人类征服自然并使自然为自己服务的不断努力；人类对落后状态，对每一时代的现状以及对压迫者进行的不懈斗争。
    过去诞生了现在，但是在生活斗争中间，每个时代的构造都有着质的区别。和平和进步的长期目标是始终如一的，但是每个具体时代的内容都有它自己的特点，反映着人类征服自然的程度和他们所取得的社会进步。
    每前进一步都是人类解决某种重要问题的结果。我们说，历史已经有了一个“转折点”。人类历史发展的每个阶段都是循着它的道路前进，并且走到它的终点；从随之而来的危机中，就产生了新阶段的一代的环境。人类，历史的创造者，首先了解他们的不断变化的环境，然后创造适合这种新环境的经济，政治和社会关系。于是历史又开始一个新的循环，但是是在一个更高的水平上。人类的能力又一次得到提高，证明他们具有无限发展的能力。
    历史也是一个连锁反应的过程，变化并不是各处同时发生的，而是由于种种历史原因，变化先在一处或几处发生，然后，新形式在它表明了比现有的形式优越以后，便被其他地方采取，并且成为它们自己的信条。这部分地可以说明人类发展的不平衡。在以前的时代里，这种变化有时需要几百年才普及全世界，原因是文明的水平低。但是在目前这个时代，在几十年之间就发生这样的变化，并且对广大地区发生巨大的影响。虽然在每一个时代和在每一个地方都会有些人由于缺乏认识或保护他们的既得利益企图阻挠、避免或防止这些变化的到来，但是历史表明，这种企图是没有用的。变化是不可避免的。它适用于各种形式的社会。它的到来是不可改变的。
    历史将以这种方式继续展开它的章页，直到人类消除了一切压迫和普遍而永久地承认友爱之谊为止。那时，各国人民之间将获致持久的和平。到了那时候，历史的主要内容将是人类对自然的集体斗争，把人类对自然的控制提高到可能达到的最高点。生活的真髓将是无尽止地追求更大的进步。
    二
    四十年前，在黑暗的沙皇俄国，苏联共产党领导伟大的十月社会主义革命走向了胜利。我们有充分理由可以称它是历史上的一个“转折点”。因为在人类历史上显然没有其他任何事件在意义上能够与它相比。这是一种具有决定意义的突破，是一声进步的响雷，它震撼了世界，并且，自从那具有历史意义的十天以来，一直在决定着世界的方向。
    人类走向和平和进步的道路是漫长、曲折的。直到现在，阶级压迫一直是每个社会的标志，曾经有过很多次反对阶级压迫的抗议、起义和革命。但是，没有一次能够引起一种会带来一个完全新型的社会，一个人民不受苦难的社会的根本的变化——即废除生产资料私有制。只有十月社会主义革命才做到了这一点。这就是十月社会主义革命同在它以前的和导致它的发生的一切英勇努力不同的地方。
    正是这次惊天动地的伟大事件在苏联消灭了阶级和民族压迫，禁止了一切形式的剥削，第一次把男女、一切种族和民族平等对待。在这一社会主义的基础上，历史上第一个真正民主的国家建立了，这个国家是牢牢地在占人口压倒多数的普通劳动人民中间扎根的，它唯一的目的就是实现他们要求进步的意愿。同时，在国际舞台上，也第一次出现了一个这样的国家，它没有追求利润的阶级在政治上和经济上热衷于战争，因此，它热望和平，愿意根据列宁所宣布的和平共处的原则同一切国家安然相处。
    十月社会主义革命的确是人类一个伟大的胜利。这是伟大的列宁把马克思主义的科学思想创造性地运用于帝国主义时代的辉煌表现。由于马克思和列宁的天才，世界知道了我们周围的自然力量和社会力量是可以了解的，是可以用来争取一个民族的解放的。自那时以来的四十年中，苏联的进步表明，我们人类可以对这些力量发挥我们的意志，使这些力量产生我们所希望的结果。这无可辩驳地证明，人类能够成为他们环境的主宰。
    关于这一点，我们还需要什么比苏联不久以前宣布发射第一颗人造卫星这件事更大的证明呢？苏联科学家们这一绝对惊人的成就告诉我们，人类差不多已经踏在一个完全新的发展轨道的门槛上了。根据苏联的科学和教育一般的发展情况来看，根据在和平应用原子能和喷气推进航空学方面以及自动化和建设方面的伟大成就来看，最近这个伟大的成就，表明了社会主义社会的力量和它在发展科学为和平和人类进步服务的能力方面比其他任何形式的社会的优越性。它是十月社会主义革命四十周年一个多么光荣的象征呵！
    自从1917年10月以来，人类中的最先进分子以马克思列宁主义为根据向每一个大陆上的资本主义、殖民主义和封建主义的统治提出了挑战。在这四十年间，马克思列宁主义已经为广大的群众所接受，它往往鼓舞了整个民族对落后状态和几千年来意味着人民受奴役的不平等现象发动了最后的进攻。这种变化将在全世界实现，这是不可避免的事。人类向社会主义的迈进是不可改变的。
    三
    十月社会主义革命标志着一个时代的死亡，也就是帝国主义和殖民帝国时代的死亡。这些帝国包括了地球上大部分地区、人口和财富，人们可以理解为什么甚至像李普曼之流的著名的资产阶级政治评论家也说这种死亡是“……二十世纪的一个伟大的历史现象”。的确是这样，因为阻挠这一大部分人类走向和平及进步的主要障碍现在已经永远铲除了。
    正如列宁所说的，十月社会主义革命在最弱的一环上突破了帝国主义的锁链。这就在亚洲和非洲引起了一种日渐加速的反应，也就是一种逐渐腐蚀帝国主义的心脏的解体过程。
    1917年10月以后，东方永远不是原来的样子了。苏联击溃反革命军队和进行干涉的帝国主义国家的军队，证明了尽管这些军队貌似强大，但是是可以打败的。团结起来为正义事业而斗争的人民的力量已经证明大大超过任何企图阻碍历史前进的力量的总和。
    这使整个亚洲和非洲的民族独立运动获得了新的勇气和精神。第二次世界大战后，反殖民主义的浪潮高涨到如此程度，以致在以后的十年中，有十三亿亚洲和非洲人民摆脱了帝国主义的统治。
    苏维埃国家是历史上第一个、而且是许多年间唯一的站在被奴役的民族这边的大国。同样，这些民族在争取到独立以后，苏联一方面把它们的主权和完整视作神圣不可侵犯，一方面总是愿意向它们伸出援助的手，帮助它们加紧努力，达到现代的文化和经济水平。
    在这一点上，苏联本身又成为一种鼓舞力量。苏联各族人民在他们伟大的共产党的领导下，克服了无比的困难，使自己的国家从落后状态进而成为世界上主要的工业国之一。他们在短短的几十年间达到了这一点，而其间有十八年不得不用在保护苏维埃国土抵抗敌人和修复战争的破坏上。
    这个伟大的努力说明人民具有多么巨大的潜在才能和力量，特别是当他们组织起来为伟大的社会主义理想而斗争和劳动的时候。苏联各族人民的英雄事迹在全世界千百万有着类似性质和范围的问题的人们的心目中留下了刻骨铭心的印象。
    十月社会主义革命和已经得到事实证明的社会主义制度的优越性给了中国人民极深的影响。1917年10月的炮声给我们带来了马克思列宁主义。由此产生了中国共产党，产生了中国民主革命胜利的希望。苏维埃国家的迅速发展启发了一切热诚希望中国进步的人。当他们看到苏联迅速而有效地解决自己的经济问题和政治问题的时候，他们就认识到：如果中国作为一个民族也想要继续生存下去，就只能选择社会主义而不能选择资本主义。
    “……有了俄国革命，世界人类便生出了一个大希望。”这就是孙中山对十月社会主义革命的估价。我们都知道，当他听到世界帝国主义受到了一次“毁灭性打击”的消息的时候，他是多么兴奋。孙中山知道这一事件在中国和全世界一定会引起反响。他最密切地注视着苏维埃政府的动态，研究它的各种政策和方法。虽然由于两人隔得很远，联络不便，他不可能像自己所希望的那样常常同列宁通信，但是他是了解这位伟大无畏的革命者的可贵之处的。我还记得他听到列宁逝世的消息的时候感到多么深切的悲痛。但是他对列宁所留下的共产党的信念是不可动摇的，他说过，这将能保证列宁的理想和计划能够胜利实现。
    孙中山从十月社会主义革命学到了东西，中国的其他革命者也从这一革命中学到了东西。这使得他们把广大工人、农民、学生和其他民主力量团结在中国共产党这个最坚决反帝反封建的政党的旗帜下。这是极其宝贵的一堂课，它从此决定了中国革命的道路。
    中国人民最初是从苏维埃国家的行动中学到无产阶级国际主义的。我们国家曾遭遇到被帝国主义列强瓜分为“势力范围”的命运，我国人民在自己的国土上变成了“二等”公民，因而当苏联毫无种族歧视地以平等对待我们的时候，我们在政治上上了生动的一课。这一具体事例特别使得中国的许多知识分子抛弃了原来的幻想和通过联合帝国主义国家来争取独立和自由的希望。这一事例告诉他们，只有像苏联这样一个社会主义国家才真诚地希望他们在实现民族愿望的斗争中得到胜利。
    苏联一开始就对中国人民发表声明、沙皇俄国强加于中国的不平等条约的废除、对中国争取解放的斗争所给予的积极支持——这一切对当时的斗争都是极为重要的。
    在整个中国革命最艰苦的年代中，苏联政府和人民一直抱着这种关切的态度，这对我们的革命战士是一种不断的鼓舞力量，在他们面前始终有着1917年10月的榜样，他们知道，就在他们遇到最严重的困难的时刻里，苏联正在建设社会主义。这使得他们相信，他们自己将会取得胜利，总有一天中国也要建立起社会主义。
    中国人民在中国共产党领导下，在1949年取得了自己的胜利。这是一个异常重大的事件。这对世界帝国主义来说是第二个“毁灭性的打击”。它把苏联和中国连成了一片幅员广大的土地，和新兴的人民民主国家一起，第一次形成了世界的社会主义部分，形成了和平和进步的强大堡垒。和其它亚非国家的民族主义胜利一起，它表明十月社会主义革命所引起的过程现在已经有了这样巨大的前进力量，以致没有东西能够阻挡它，历史正在循着它的不可改变的道路前进。
    事实上，在东方已经出现了一支新的、巨大的政治力量，它首先是为亚洲和非洲发言的，但是，它的发言对世界事务也是有权威和影响的。和平共处五项原则证明了这支力量的崇高的道义性质；有历史意义的万隆会议证明了它的范围之广。这使得整个世界力量对比有了一个最有意义的变化。
    越来越多的证据表明，在世界性和地区性问题上，亚非国家的观点同帝国主义者的观点之间，分歧正在扩大。另一方面，也有很多证据表明，亚非国家和以苏联为首的世界社会主义部分之间关系越来越亲近了。这是因为在和平、各国和各民族平等、各国之间友好合作这些问题上，它们的见解非常接近。
    这三个巨大的地区和人口在上述一些问题上的一致，已经在国际生活中产生了一种从未有过的政治现象：出现了一个和平和友谊的地区，它包括三大洲上不同制度的国家，有着密切的政治、经济和文化关系。这种合作对于亿万亚洲和非洲人民在他们的国家建设中取得进展起了有利的作用。它捍卫着他们的独立和主权，埃及和叙利亚的情况就是明证。它代表大多数人类，对于在今天的世界里大战并不是不可避免的这样一个观念赋予了重大内容。
    在这里我们可以看到过去的情况说明，人类对和平和进步的愿望，像在现时代中通过社会主义事业和民族独立事业的团结和相互作用所表现的，已经成了世界舞台上最有力的政治思想。
    四
    推动十月社会主义革命的思想——马克思列宁主义的真理——是谋求改变的。这种思想是人类所创造的第一个真正为重新安排事物的秩序带来希望的东西，重新安排事物的秩序是为了缔造持久的世界和平和使人类能够得到无限的进步。
    马克思列宁主义的原则具有普遍性。它们是一切地方的一切被压迫的人获得解放的钥匙。因此社会主义运动从一开始就有它的国际性的方面；而这个运动的国际团结一直是它的力量的一个主要泉源。当世界上只有少数马克思列宁主义者的时候是如此；而在他们人数已在三千万以上、全世界的三分之一已经走上了社会主义道路的今天更是如此。
    在本世纪初，世界局势的发展情况是：社会主义首先在苏联胜利了。由于为取得这个胜利和建设社会主义的胜利曾经进行过严重的斗争，苏联共产党、苏联政府和人民在应用马克思列宁主义方面得到了极丰富的经验。这是每一个客观的进步人士早已承认的事实。
    历史决定苏联应该成为全世界工人阶级运动的中心。苏联共产党和苏联人民了解这种历史的要求，他们把它看作一种巨大的光荣和责任。他们了解，他们的行动和领导将会使全世界懂得无产阶级国际主义的意义。过去四十年的历史记录表明，这项重大的责任是托付给可靠的人的。已经作出的贡献对于使亿万人民从帝国主义和资本主义奴役下获得解放有过很大的帮助。
    不久以前，有些人惯于忘记这一段历史。他们一味过分强调某些错误，而有意无意地忽视那些错误的根源以及造成那些错误的客观条件，例如国际工人阶级运动及其内部关系从历史的意义上来说还是新东西。
    世界反动派是善于抓住任何有利于它自己的事情的，特别是在它的反对社会主义思想和工人阶级运动的不停的斗争中。今天，它发现上述趋向对它很有利。
    让我们来全面地看一下这个局势。
    现在，任何人都不能再否认苏联和社会主义阵营的成就了，也不能否认殖民主义制度的崩溃。但是这并没有使愚人不再梦想。以美国侵略集团为中心的世界反动派顽固不化地死抱住自己的幻想，认为在过去半个世纪里所发生的所有这些重大变化都是暂时的，它的“哲学家”作出这样的结论说：社会主义制度仅仅是一个“暂时的现象”，民族主义的国家迟早总要屈服在万能的美元之下。
      自然，这些“哲学家”仍然妄想通过军事力量猛烈的一击来收复他们的“失地”。但是，他们是有点约制的，因为他们了解到，他们不再拥有为了进行这样的军事冒险所必需的压倒优势力量。别人也有他们那样的力量，如果不是比他们大的话。这样，由于全世界的舆论要求各国和平共处和友好，轻举妄动使用军事力量将会引起政治上的完全崩溃。
    由于军事道路是一条死胡同，这些“哲学家”就想“从内部来进攻”。为了要这样做，他们曾经不得不把他们的活动提高到更高的水平，提高到政治思想领域。为了百般夸大事实，他们把工人阶级运动中少数几个人的动摇夸大为普遍的现象。为了达到这个目的，他们捏造了所谓“民族共产主义”。他们巧妙地制造这个名词，表面上看来不是为了要怀疑共产主义比资本主义优越，但是由于它暗示各个国家的共产主义应当有根本的不同而实际上使这一点遭到了怀疑。实际上，这是对作为人民夺取政权的斗争和社会主义的建设的指导的马克思列宁主义的一种进攻；这也是要想打击苏联在社会主义阵营里的领导地位的一种企图。
    首先，这种说法企图歪曲马克思列宁主义，并且想使它成为死板的教条。这是企图使修正主义复活，从而分裂社会主义阵营和工人阶级运动队伍。它企图模糊真正的马克思列宁主义，马克思列宁主义认为，它的某些原则适用于每一个国家的情况，而同时要求把每个国家的民族条件、利益和感情都要考虑到。
    其次，这种说法企图使其它社会主义国家离开苏联，以此来破坏国际社会主义运动的心脏，它的伟大的团结。这是帝国主义的惯技，“分而治之”，孤立各国和各民族，使得它们一旦失掉了由于团结而得到的力量后，单个地就不是帝国主义力量的对手了。这是企图利用各国从旧社会遗留下来的某些资产阶级民族主义的倾向。这种说法再一次企图歪曲马克思列宁主义，因为马克思列宁主义的内容既包括无产阶级国际主义，又包括每个国家的人民对他们自己的国家的爱国主义。
    我们看到，世界反动派“哲学家”一直是毫不犹豫地利用大量的颠覆活动和武装反革命暴乱来“突出表现”他们在政治思想领域的冒险，但是我们也看到，对于这种活动和暴乱，人民能够作迅速的决定性的处理。
    不论世界反动派对社会主义阵营和世界工人阶级运动发动什么方式的进攻，不论他们用什么名义来掩饰这种进攻，他们的进攻一定会受到应有的挫败。一切希望和平和进步的人们显然完全有责任这样做。我们必须作一切可能和必要的努力，在马克思列宁主义的基础上加强以苏联为中心的社会主义运动的国际团结。因为，这样，而且也只有这样才符合于一切地方的劳动人民的最大利益，符合于正在为民族独立而斗争的人们的最大利益，符合于全人类的幸福的最大利益。
    中国人民为自己能够成为人类进步的先锋队的一部分而感到自豪，他们认为保持和加强国际社会主义运动的团结具有最重大的意义。在我们看来，为了这一伟大事业而作的努力无论多大也不算过分。这方面首要的事情就是我们决心坚持不懈地为增进中苏友谊而努力；这种友谊今天已经成为我们事业的牢不可破的基础。我们将永远同我们亲密的朋友苏联并肩站在一起！十月社会主义革命的道路就是我们的道路。这是马克思列宁主义的道路。这是人类的希望！
