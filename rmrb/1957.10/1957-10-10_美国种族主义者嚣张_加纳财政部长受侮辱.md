Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th: Ghana's Finance Minister, Gbedemah, who is visiting the United States, said on October 9th that he was subjected to racial discrimination on the evening of October 7th.

	Gbedemah and his secretary stopped their car in front of a restaurant in Dover, Delaware, on the evening of the 7th and asked the bartender for two glasses of orange juice. The bartender gave him the orange juice but would not allow him to sit and drink it at the bar, telling him, "Blacks are not allowed to eat here."

	Gbedemah produced his Ghanaian official credentials, but he was still not allowed to sit down and drink.

	Gbedemah said that when he first arrived in the United States, American officials told him, "The Little Rock discrimination against blacks is an exception, and it is not like that in other parts of the United States." He said he doesn't quite believe that anymore.

	Gbedemah stated that he would write a letter of protest to the State Department himself, and that after returning to his country, he would formally protest to the U.S. government through the U.S. Ambassador to Ghana.

    美国种族主义者嚣张
    加纳财政部长受侮辱
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：来美国访问的加纳财政部长杰德马10月9日说，他在10月7日晚上受到了种族歧视的待遇。
    杰德马和他的秘书7日晚上在特拉华州道维尔的一家饭店前停下汽车，向酒吧的招待员要了两杯橘子水，招待员把橘子水交给他，但是不准他坐在酒吧旁喝，招待员对他说：“黑人不许在这里吃。”
    杰德马拿出了加纳官员证书，但是仍然不准他坐下来喝。
    杰德马说，当他初到美国的时候，美国官员曾经对他说：“小石城歧视黑人事件是例外，在美国的其他地方不是那样的。”他说他现在不怎么相信这种话了。
    杰德马表示，他一定要自己写信向国务院提出抗议，他回国以后还将通过美国驻加纳大使正式向美国政府抗议。
