Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th. Agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province are universally adjusting the ratio of public accumulation to consumption distribution during the autumn harvest distribution, appropriately expanding the accumulation of public funds to create conditions for expanding production next year. According to statistics, this year, agricultural cooperatives will extract more than 19.6 million yuan from the total agricultural output value as public accumulation funds, and about 40% of it will be immediately invested in winter agricultural capital construction. Agricultural cooperatives in Jinan and Changzhi and other places have discussed the combination of individual and collective interests, and immediate and long-term interests. The proportion of public accumulation funds in each cooperative has been initially determined to generally increase from 5% last year to about 10%. The Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Yangqu County accepted the lesson that the lack of public accumulation last year led to a shortage of fertilizer, insufficient livestock, and the inability to quickly develop the pig-raising industry, and also incurred debts. This year, it will extract more than 15,000 yuan from the total income as public accumulation, so that the funds for expanding reproduction next year will increase by more than two times compared with this year.

According to an investigation and analysis by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, some agricultural cooperatives in various places had a bias of neglecting public accumulation in last year's distribution, which brought difficulties to expanding reproduction this year. Among the more than 20,000 agricultural cooperatives in the province, only 20% have the ability to expand reproduction, and the rest can only maintain simple reproduction or must be helped by national loans. In view of this situation, this year the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires that: under the condition of ensuring that 80% to 85% of the members of the increased production cooperatives increase their income, the proportion of public accumulation funds deducted from the actual income can account for 5% to 10%, and the cooperatives with more increased production can account for more than 10%; the reduced production cooperatives should also appropriately accumulate a certain amount of public accumulation funds, so that next year they will have more funds for expanding reproduction.

　　山西省农业社秋收分配中的好现象
    普遍增加公共资金积累  为明年扩大生产作准备
    新华社太原13日电　山西省各地农业社在秋收分配中，普遍调整公共积累和消费分配的比例，适当扩大公共资金的积累，为明年扩大生产创造条件。据统计：今年农业社将从农业生产总产值中抽出一千九百六十多万元作为公积金，并且把其中的40％左右立即投入冬季农业基本建设。晋南、长治等地农业社为此曾对个人与集体，眼前和长远利益的结合问题作了讨论。各社公积金比例，初步确定一般均由去年的5％提高到10％左右。阳曲县五星农业社接受了去年公共积累少，使今年肥料缺乏，畜力不足，养猪事业不能很快发展，而且负债的教训，今年将从总收入中抽出一万五千多元作为公共积累，使明年扩大再生产的资金比今年增加两倍多。
    据中共山西省委调查分析：各地农业社去年分配中，有的发生忽视公积金积累的偏向，给今年扩大再生产带来了困难。全省两万多个农业社中，仅有20％的社具有扩大再生产的能力，其余的只能维持简单再生产或必须由国家贷款帮助。鉴于这种情况，今年中共山西省委要求：增产社在保证80％到85％的社员增加收入的条件下，从实际收入中扣除公积金的比例可占到5％到10％，增产多的社可占10％以上；减产社也要适当积累一定的公积金，以便明年有更多的资金用于扩大再生产。
