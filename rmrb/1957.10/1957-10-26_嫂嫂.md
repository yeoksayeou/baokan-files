Sister-in-law
He Yunxiang

I returned home, and as soon as Mom saw me, she called out affectionately, "Ah! Meidi, you're back!" Then I saw my sister-in-law come out of the room, draped in a corduroy jacket, her eyes still sleepy. I immediately felt a lump in my throat: she's not sick, so why isn't she working in the fields, and instead sleeping during the day?

	"Little aunt, how many days are you staying?" As soon as Mom left, my sister-in-law opened her mouth to ask me.
	"I'm going back tomorrow!"
	"Only staying one day?" My sister-in-law said, thinking for a while, then reached into her pocket and pulled out a roll of bills, lowered her voice and said, "This is forty yuan, I want to ask you to buy seven feet of melton wool in the city, and also buy a pair of leather shoes... How much will it cost?"
	"Oh!" I calculated a little and said, "About forty-five yuan."

When my sister-in-law heard that the money wasn't enough, she frowned and said, "I'll give you the rest tomorrow."

I took the money, a little surprised, but not wanting to ask directly, so I went out to visit the villagers.

It got dark, and I was walking home from seeing a friend at the township People's Committee, flickering my flashlight on and off. As I approached the door, I saw my sister-in-law coming out of the house. When she saw the flashlight beam, she turned around and walked away anxiously.

	"Sister-in-law! Where are you going?" I quickly called out.

When my sister-in-law heard it was me, she walked towards me, stammering, "I... I'm going to Dad's house."
	"It's too late, wouldn't it be better to go tomorrow morning?"
	"I have to go. To... Today Dad sent a message with someone, asking me to go back."
	"Sister-in-law!" I hurried forward a few steps and said, "It's not easy to walk in the dark! If you have to go, take my flashlight!" As I said that, I turned on the flashlight. This flash made me pause: I didn't see my sister-in-law pregnant during the day, how could she be... at night...? Oh! A thought flashed through my mind: no wonder my sister-in-law slept during the day, she was disguising herself as "pregnant" at night?! Ah! Where did the money for buying cloth and shoes to give as gifts come from? The questions from the daytime were suddenly answered in my mind. So I jokingly said:
	"Ah! Sister-in-law, are you 'expecting'?"
	"No, no!" Saying this, she turned her head away, and hurriedly used her left hand to support her "big belly".
	"You have to go, let me take you back?"
	"Don't take me, don't take me!" My sister-in-law pushed my shoulder and said, "You go back first! Mom will be worried!"
	"Then shall I take you to the embankment?"
	"Okay!" My sister-in-law replied helplessly.

On the road, my sister-in-law constantly used both hands to support her "big belly". The sea breeze blew her hair up, but she didn't bother to fix it, only looking around as she walked ahead.

	"This year we suffered from typhoon disasters, is the life of the commune members still okay?" After a long silence, I asked.
	"It's okay. The typhoon was not light! Luckily the forecast was early, which reduced a lot of losses. Before and after the typhoon, it would have been difficult without the help of the cooperative!"
	"This is the benefit of cooperativization!"
	"Yes! After cooperativization, everything has changed."
	"What has changed?"
	"There are so many changes!" My sister-in-law turned her head and said, "Like the old woman Huang Xian, who used to beg for food all the time, now she has not only become a 'Five Guarantees household', but also raises the cooperative's chickens and ducks so fat; also, Uncle Zhonglin, who used to love gambling like his life, has not only stopped gambling since the day the cooperative merged, but also mobilized the members of the team to burn all the mahjong tiles and dominoes!..."

I interjected: "Are there still people selling privately?"
	"Oh!" My sister-in-law said slowly, "I'm afraid... not anymore!"
	"I heard there are still some?"
	"...There are, but only a few individuals."
	"Yes! There are just a few backward elements who are unwilling to produce properly and spend all day doing this kind of worthless thing."

When my sister-in-law heard this, she lowered her head and quickened her pace.

When we got to the sea wall, I said, "Let's sit down for a while!"
	"Okay!" As soon as my sister-in-law finished speaking, she sat down on the embankment grass, breathing slightly. It looked like it was very tiring. I shined the flashlight around, preparing to sit down. Suddenly I saw the "embankment grave" at the foot of the embankment – it was Dad's grave. When I thought of Dad's death, my nose soured, and I couldn't help but shed a few tears.

Seeing me standing and not sitting, my sister-in-law asked, "Why aren't you sitting down?"
	"I saw Dad's grave, and I feel sad." My voice was a little shaky.
	"Old people always die. Dad has been dead for many years, what's the use of thinking about him again!"
	"Sister-in-law, you probably don't know how my dad died: that was two years before liberation, our family suffered from famine, there was no rice to cook, Dad had no choice but to pawn our only acre of land to sell private salt." I said in one breath, and saw from the starlight that my sister-in-law's head was almost touching her belly. "Who knew that before he earned a single cent, he was discovered by the salt police right here, Dad panicked, dropped the salt load and wanted to escape, but, bang, bang, a few shots, and Dad..."

As I spoke, I heard my sister-in-law sobbing softly. I quickly held back my tears and patted her shoulder, saying, "Sister-in-law, don't be sad. In the past, Dad sold private salt because he was forced to by life, and he was killed by the pseudo-salt police, but now it's different, 'after cooperativization, everything has changed'. If Dad were alive now, he would definitely not do this kind of thing."
	"It's just me... I haven't changed for the better..." My sister-in-law cried in a choked voice.
	"Sister-in-law," I called out, gently patted my sister-in-law's shoulder, and said bluntly: "Don't be angry, is it right to do illegal things for some small immediate benefits? Besides, you put the salt tied to your belly, your body..."

Before I could finish speaking, my sister-in-law suddenly untied the salt package from her belly, her head fell suddenly into my arms, and she sobbed, "Little aunt, I... shouldn't smuggle, I... know I did wrong, I was greedy for a little money."

Then, she slowly stood up, squeezed my hand tightly, and said, "Little aunt, go! Go to the government to confess..."

The night was deep, and the stars were still watching in the sky. I carried the salt package for my sister-in-law, and together we walked towards the township easily.

Note: "Big belly" is a disguise used by backward women to carry smuggled salt.
Note: Near the coastal salt area there are no mountains. After the salt farmers die, they dig a gap at the edge of the pond and bury the coffin in the pond as a grave.

    嫂嫂
    何云祥
    我回到家里，妈一见就亲切地叫了起来：“啊！美娣，你回来啦！”接着便见嫂嫂披着灯芯绒夹衣，睡眼惺忪地从房里出来。我一瞧心里就有了个疙瘩：没生病，为啥不去生产，反而白天睡大觉？
      “小姑，住几天回去？”妈一走，嫂嫂就开口问我。
      “明天就回去！”
      “只住一天吗？”嫂嫂说着，想了好一会，伸手往裤袋里掏出来一卷钞票，放低了声音说：“这是四十元钱，托你在城里买七尺麦尔登，再买双皮鞋……要多少钱？”
      “哦！”我略算了一下说：“大约要四十五元。”
    嫂嫂一听钱还不够，皱了皱眉毛说：“明天再给你。”
    我接过钞票有些惊讶，但又不好直问，就出去探望乡亲了。
    天黑了，我从乡人民委员会看了个朋友回家，路上一明一暗的捏着手电筒。将到屋门口，见嫂嫂正从家里出来。她一见电筒光，一转身惶惶的向后就走。
    “嫂嫂！到啥地方去？”我忙喊着。
    嫂嫂一听是我，便朝我走来，口吃地说：“我……到爹家里去。”
    “太晚了，明天早晨去不好吗？”
    “要去的。今……今天爹叫人带了个口信来，要我回去一趟。”
    “嫂嫂！”我抢上几步说：“暗星夜路不好走啊！你一定要去，拿着我这支电筒去吧！”我说着亮了下电筒。这一亮，不觉使我一怔：白天没看到嫂嫂怀孕，怎么在晚上……。哦！我脑子一晃想到：怪不得嫂嫂白天睡大觉，原来在晚上乔装“大肚子”?啊！买布、买鞋送礼的钱哪里来？白天的疑问一下子在我的脑子里揭开了。我就半玩笑地说：
  “啊！嫂嫂，有‘喜’了吗？”
      “没有，没有！”说着，她扭转了头，慌忙地用左手托了托“大肚子”。
      “你一定要去，让我送你回去？”
      “不要送，不要送！”嫂嫂推着我的肩膀说：“你先回去吧！妈要记挂的！”
      “那么我送你到塘上好吗？”
      “也好！”嫂嫂没奈何地回答。
    路上，嫂嫂不断的用双手托托“大肚子”，海风吹竖起她的头发，她理也没理，只管东张西望的在前面走。
      “今年遭了台风灾害，社员的生活还可以吗？”闷走了一会，我问。
      “还可以。台风可不轻啊！亏得预报早，减少了不少损失。台风前后，要是没有合作社的帮助就有困难啦！”
      “这就是合作化的好处啊！”
      “是啊！合作化了，啥都变了样。”
      “变了点啥？”
      “变的可多啦！”嫂嫂回过头来说：“像过去一直要饭的黄仙婆，现在不但变成了‘五保户’，而且还把社里的鸡鸭养得又肥又胖；还有，一向爱赌如命的忠林叔，在并社那天起，不但不赌博了，还动员队里的社员把麻将牌、牌九牌都烧光啦！……”
    我插了句：“卖私的还有吗？”
      “哦！”嫂嫂慢吞吞地说：“恐怕……没有了！”
      “听说还有呢？”
      “……有，也只有个别的了。”
      “是啊！就是有个别的落后分子，不愿好好生产，整天干这种没出息事。”
    嫂嫂一听，低着头加快了脚步。
    上了海堤，我说：“坐一下吧！”
    “好！”嫂嫂话一落音，已坐在塘草上微微的在喘着气。看样子，是很吃力了。我向四周围亮了下电筒准备坐下去。猛地看见了塘脚边的“塘坟”?，这正是爹的坟。我一想到爹的死，鼻子一酸，情不自禁地流出了几滴眼泪水。
    嫂嫂见我站着不坐，问道：“为啥不坐下来呢？”
    “我看到了爹的坟，就心里难过。”我的声音有些发抖。
    “人老了总要死的。爹爹已亡故多年了，再想他做啥啊！”
    “嫂嫂，你大概还不知道我爹是怎么死的：那是解放前二年，我家遭年荒，没米下锅，爹没法子，才典了仅有的一亩地，去贩私盐。”我一口气说到这里，从星光下看到嫂嫂的头，低的快碰到了肚子。“谁知一分钱还没赚到，就在这儿被盐警发觉，爹一慌，甩掉盐担想逃，不料，砰砰几枪，爹就……”
    我说着，已听见嫂嫂低微的抽噎声。我连忙忍住眼泪，拍着她肩膀说：“嫂嫂，不要难过。过去，爹卖私盐是被生活所迫，才被伪盐警弄死，现在不同了，‘合作化了，啥都变了样’。假如爹活到现在，一定不会干这勾当的。”
      “就是我……我没有变好……”嫂嫂呜咽地哭起来。
      “嫂嫂，”我叫了声，用手在嫂嫂的肩上轻轻的拍了拍，就直截了当的说：“你不要见气，为了些眼前小利，干违法的勾当，这是应当吗？再说，你把食盐绑在肚子上，你的身体……”
    没等我说完，嫂嫂突然从肚子上解下了盐包，她的头猛的倒在我的怀里，抽抽咽咽的说：“小姑，我……不应该走私，我……知道做错了，贪图几个小钱。”
    接着，她便慢慢地站了起来，捏紧了我的手，说：“小姑，去！到政府坦白去……”
    夜深了，星星还在天空张望着。我替嫂嫂背着盐包，一同轻松的往乡里走去。
    注?：“大肚子”是落后妇女夹带私盐的一种伪装。
    注?：近海盐区无山地，盐民死后，都在塘边掘一个缺口，把棺材埋在塘内，作为坟墓。
