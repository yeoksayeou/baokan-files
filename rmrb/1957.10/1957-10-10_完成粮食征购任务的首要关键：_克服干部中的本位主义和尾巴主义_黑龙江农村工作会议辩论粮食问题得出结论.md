Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Dispatch: Overcoming bureaucratism and tailism among leading cadres is the primary key to completing grain purchase tasks. This is the conclusion reached by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China at the rural work conference that ended on the 2nd, after a major debate on the grain issue. The conference was attended by 423 people, including secretaries of local and county party committees throughout the province, ministers of rural affairs, propaganda, and organization of county party committees, as well as county heads and directors of grain bureaus from various counties.

From September 24th to 29th, based on issues raised during small group discussions and open forums, the conference focused on questions such as: Is the grain purchase task too heavy? Is there a contradiction between the "Three Fixes" policy and the grain purchase task? Is the grain retention standard sufficient for consumption? After the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain, is the relationship between the Party and the masses better or worse? Heated and serious debates were conducted in small groups and joint group meetings. During the debates, it was revealed that some county leading cadres had quite serious bureaucratism, tailism, and one-sided mass perspectives in accepting and completing the grain purchase task. Some cadres used incorrect methods to deal with the grain purchase task, namely: underreporting production, overreporting disasters, requesting smaller grain purchase quotas, retaining more grain for rations and fodder, and delaying the outward transfer of grain. They believed that this would make it easier to complete the task, make the work easier, make their own faces look better, and gain the support of the masses. These erroneous ideas and various fallacies were severely exposed and criticized in small groups and joint group meetings. The cadres who attended the meeting unanimously reflected that participating in this debate was equivalent to attending three major lessons (socialism lesson, philosophy lesson, and mass line lesson). Thus, they clarified the ideological boundary between socialism and capitalism on the grain issue and realized that the grain issue is a matter of building socialism. Cadres from Tangyuan, Keshan, Lindian, and other counties used many facts to prove that having surplus grain in the hands of farmers is detrimental to socialism. For example, some cooperative members used surplus grain for speculative trading. The county head of Tieli used facts he discovered during mass debates to illustrate that the atmosphere of grain shortage was spread by a small number of wealthy middle peasants, who in fact were not short of grain. Wang Xiuqin, a wealthy middle peasant from the Xinsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the county, had a family of eight who were allocated more than 4,000 jin of grain, which was enough to eat, but they consumed 800 jin for lavish eating and drinking at his son's wedding and wasted 300 jin feeding pigs. He instead complained that the grain retention standard was low. The Party Secretary of Huachuan County confessed that he came to the meeting with a complaining attitude that "the grain purchase task is heavy," but after the debate, he realized that the main problem in failing to complete the grain task last year was in his ideology and work. He did not sufficiently understand the significance of the grain task and had a one-sided mass perspective, so the rations and fodder were higher than the grain retention standard, and nearly 20,000 tons of grain were lost and wasted.

Leading cadres summarized in the debate that there are six major disadvantages to not seriously implementing the unified purchase and sale of grain: affecting national construction and the exertion of the superiority of cooperativization; affecting the implementation of the principle of distribution according to work by cooperatives; affecting the development of production in agricultural cooperatives; creating disunity among cadres at different levels; and fostering the development of rural capitalism.

Some people came to the meeting with two sets of grain accounts, preparing to request a smaller grain purchase quota. After the debate, they changed this wrong plan.

At the general meeting on the 29th, Yang Yichen, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, gave a concluding speech on the major debate on the grain issue and answered the questions raised in the debate. He explained, based on the grain harvest situation, commodity grain ratio, and actual grain purchased in Heilongjiang Province over the past few years, that the grain purchase task allocated by the state was appropriate and not heavy. The reason why the grain purchase plan was not completed last year was that, in addition to objective reasons, the subjective reasons were mainly that cadres had bureaucratism and tailism ideas, and the work was not done well, which led to the phenomenon of serious waste of grain. The waste and spoilage of grain in the province last year was serious. He pointed out that the grain purchase task and the "Three Fixes" policy are consistent. Facts have proved that places that complete the task better also implement the policy better, and places where the policy is not well implemented also do not complete the grain purchase task well. Saying that there is a contradiction between the policy and the task is an excuse for taking a passive attitude towards the grain task. He said that the specific situation in Heilongjiang Province and the facts provided by everyone in the debate prove that the grain retention standard is sufficient. Only a small number of people with serious capitalist ideas are shouting that there is not enough grain. Based on the specific materials provided by everyone in the debate, he explained that the relationship between the Party and the masses is better. Unified purchase and sale eliminated grain speculation and ensured that everyone had grain to eat, so most people support it. Yang Yichen emphasized that to ensure the completion of the grain purchase task and the correct implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy, it is first necessary to overcome bureaucratism, tailism, and one-sided mass viewpoints among cadres.

    完成粮食征购任务的首要关键：
    克服干部中的本位主义和尾巴主义
    黑龙江农村工作会议辩论粮食问题得出结论
    本报特约新华社哈尔滨电　克服领导干部的本位主义和尾巴主义思想，是完成粮食征购任务的首要关键。这是中共黑龙江省委在2日结束的农村工作会议上，关于粮食问题大辩论所得出的结论。参加会议的有全省各地、县委书记，县委农村、宣传、组织部长和各县县长、粮食局长等四百二十三人。
    在9月24日到29日的会议上，根据小组酝酿和鸣放中提出的问题，集中地对粮食征购任务重不重？“三定”政策和购粮任务有无矛盾？留粮标准够不够消费？实行粮食统购统销后，党和群众的关系是好还是坏等问题，在小组会和联组会上，展开了热烈又严肃的辩论。在争辩中，暴露了在接受和完成征购粮任务上，有的县领导干部存在着相当严重的本位主义、尾巴主义和片面群众观点。某些干部用错误的方法对待购粮任务，即：低报产量、多报灾情、少要购粮任务、多留口粮马料、拖延外调粮。他们认为这样容易完成任务，工作好做，自己的面子好看，群众拥护。这些错误思想和各种谬论，在小组和联组会上，通过提问题、摆事实、讲道理，受到了严厉的揭露和批判。到会干部一致反映，参加这次辩论，等于上了三大课（社会主义课、哲学课和群众路线课）。从而划清了在粮食问题上的社会主义和资本主义思想界线，认识到粮食问题就是建设社会主义问题。汤原、克山、林甸等县参加会议的干部用许多事实证明，农民手中余粮多，不利于社会主义，例如有些合作社社员用余粮做投机买卖。铁力县长用他参加群众大辩论中发现的事实说明，叫喊粮食紧张的空气，是由少数富裕中农散布的，事实上他们并不缺粮。该县新生农业生产合作社富裕中农王秀琴，一家八口分了四千多斤粮食，本来够吃，却为儿子结婚大吃大喝消耗了八百斤粮，喂猪浪费三百斤粮，他反而埋怨留粮标准低。桦川县委书记检讨说：他是抱着“购粮任务重”的埋怨情绪来开会的，但经过辩论，认识到去年没完成粮食任务，主要是思想和工作中存在问题，对粮食任务的重大意义认识不足，有片面群众观点，因而口粮、马料都高于留粮标准，还损失浪费将近两万吨粮食。
    领导干部在辩论中总结出不认真执行粮食统购统销有六大坏处，即影响国家建设和合作化优越性的发挥；影响合作社贯彻按劳取酬的原则；影响农业社发展生产；造成上下级干部不团结；助长了农村资本主义的发展。
    有些人来开会时带着两套粮食账，准备少要些购粮任务。经过辩论，就改变了这种错误打算。
    在29日的大会上，省委书记杨易辰对粮食问题的大辩论做了总结发言，并回答了辩论中提出的问题。他从黑龙江省几年来粮食收成情况、商品粮比率和实际购到的粮食，说明国家分配的购粮任务是合适的，并不重。去年没有完成购粮计划，除客观原因外，主观上主要是干部存在着本位主义和尾巴主义思想，工作做的不好，以致发生了严重的浪费粮食的现象。去年全省浪费、糟损的粮食严重。他指出购粮任务和“三定”政策是一致的，事实证明，凡是完成任务较好的地方，贯彻政策也较好，政策执行不好的地方，购粮任务也完成的不好。说政策和任务有矛盾是对粮食任务采取消极态度的借口。他说从黑龙江省具体情况和大家在辩论中提供的事实证明，留粮标准是够用的，叫喊粮食不够的只是少数资本主义思想严重的人。他根据辩论中大家提出的具体材料，说明党和群众的关系更好了，统购统销杜绝了粮食投机，保证所有人都有粮食吃，所以大多数人是拥护的。杨易辰强调指出要保证征购粮任务的完成和正确贯彻统购统销政策，首先必须克服干部中的本位主义、尾巴主义思想和片面群众观点。
