    The World's Largest and Most Mechanized Collective Agriculture
    The Brilliant Achievements of Soviet Agricultural Development
    In the forty years since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has not only achieved the socialist industrialization of the country, but also the collectivization and mechanization of agriculture, achieving brilliant success in the development of agriculture. Now, Soviet agriculture, built on a strong industrial technology and advanced agricultural science and technology, has become the world's largest and most mechanized collective agriculture.
    After the victory of the October Revolution, the Soviet regime immediately promulgated the decree on the nationalization of land, forever ending the exploitation of peasants by the landlord class. According to Lenin's cooperative plan, the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union formulated the policy of agricultural collectivization in 1927, and basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture by 1937. Now, the 25 million backward and scattered individual small peasant households before collectivization have developed into more than 87,000 large-scale collective farms equipped with advanced technology. In addition, more than 5,770 huge state farms have been established. By the beginning of this year, 8,742 machine tractor stations had been established throughout the country. 80% of the land in the country's collective farms is cultivated by tractor stations. Before the revolution, Russian peasants cultivated with millions of wooden plows, while the Soviet Union now has 1,577,000 tractors alone (calculated at 15 horsepower each), 385,000 grain combine harvesters, 631,000 trucks, and millions of other agricultural machines. Agricultural electrification has also made great progress. Due to the Soviet socialist agricultural system and technological level, the development speed of agricultural labor productivity in the Soviet Union is much faster than that of capitalist countries. For example, the Soviet Union increased by an average of 6% per year from 1929 to 1953, while the United States only increased by an average of just over 2% per year from 1930 to 1954.
    The obvious achievements of agricultural development are reflected in the continuous increase in sown area and grain output. At the beginning of 1957, the sown area of various crops in the Soviet Union had expanded by more than 50% compared with 1913, of which the sown area of wheat had almost doubled, industrial crops 1.7 times, and cotton and sugar beet twice. Not only that, but cultivation techniques and yield per unit area have also been greatly improved. The Soviet Union is now the country with the largest grain sown area in the world. In 1956, the grain sown area in the Soviet Union reached 128.3 million hectares, which is 13.8 million hectares more than the total grain sown area of the six countries including the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Italy and West Germany. In 1957, the grain sown area in the Soviet Union increased by another 1.5 million hectares compared with last year. Now the total agricultural output of the Soviet Union has increased by 1.7 times compared with 1913. In 1956, a historically unprecedented increase in production was achieved, with the total grain output increasing by more than 50% compared with 1953 before the large-scale land reclamation, and by 20% compared with 1955. In that year, agricultural laborers sold 3.3 billion poods of grain to the state (one pood equals 32.76 market catties), and state farms handed over 933 million poods of grain to the state, twice as much as in 1955. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of wheat sown area and total wheat output. In 1955, the total wheat sown area in the world was 200 million hectares, and the Soviet Union alone accounted for 60.5 million hectares. In 1956, the total wheat harvest in the Soviet Union increased by 63% compared with 1953; while in the same period, the total wheat harvest in the United States decreased by 15%.
    The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of cotton yield per unit area and quality, flax and sugar beet production. In 1956, the Soviet Union had an unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton. In that year, the total cotton output in the Soviet Union increased fivefold compared with before the October Revolution, and the cotton sown area increased twofold. In the same year, the Soviet Union averaged 2,160 kilograms of raw cotton per hectare, while the United States only harvested 1,350 kilograms. The Soviet Union's sugar beet production has long been the first in the world. The yield per unit area of sugar beet in the Kyrgyz Republic alone has caught up with the United States, greatly exceeding the levels of France, Italy, Britain and Denmark. The sugar beet sugar produced in the Soviet Union in 1955, distributed by population, averaged 17 kilograms per person, which is 5 kilograms more than the United States. The Soviet Union also ranks first in the world in terms of potato sown area and harvest.
    The rapid development of agriculture in the Soviet Union in recent years is inseparable from the achievements of large-scale reclamation of virgin and fallow land. After the September 1953 Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU decided to drastically develop agricultural production, it vigorously reclaimed wasteland. Hundreds of thousands of young people responded to the Party's call and rushed to the vast eastern region, reclaiming 35.9 million hectares of virgin and fallow land (equivalent to 538.5 million mu) in three years. The reclaimed area in the eastern Soviet Union alone is almost 1.5 times the territory of the United Kingdom, equivalent to the sum of the territories of West Germany, Austria and Belgium. During this period, the national sown area increased by almost 38 million hectares, which is more than the increase in sown area in the United States during the forty years from 1910 to 1950. In two or three years, the Soviet Union can reclaim at least another 12 million hectares.
    The development of grain production has promoted the upsurge of animal husbandry. In recent years, the growth rate of livestock products in the Soviet Union has greatly exceeded that of the United States. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has proposed that, in the next few years, it will catch up with the United States in terms of per capita meat, milk and oil production.
    Agricultural scientific research has also made great progress. Before the October Revolution, there was not a single agricultural academy of sciences or agricultural research institute in the country, but now 452 agricultural academies of sciences and agricultural scientific research institutes, and nearly 2,000 seed testing fields, experimental breeding stations and machine testing stations have been established.
    The development of agriculture has created a beautiful and happy life for Soviet farmers. Farmers' incomes have continued to increase, and the cash income of agricultural villages across the country in 1956 has increased by 73.8 billion rubles compared with 1940. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that the monetary income and material income of collective farm members should be increased by at least 40%.
    The leapfrog development of Soviet agriculture undeniably demonstrates the strong vitality and unparalleled superiority of socialism.

    世界上规模最大和机械化程度最高的集体农业
    苏联农业发展的光辉成就
    十月革命以来的四十年间，苏联不仅实现了国家的社会主义工业化，而且实现了农业的集体化和机械化，在发展农业方面获得了辉煌的成就。现在，建立在强大工业技术和先进农业科学技术基础上的苏联农业，已成为世界上规模最大、机械化程度最高的集体农业。
    十月革命胜利后，苏维埃政权立即公布了土地国有化的法令，永远结束了地主阶级对农民的剥削。按照列宁的合作社计划，苏联共产党和政府在1927年拟订了农业集体化的方针，至1937年便基本上完成了农业的社会主义改造。现在，集体化以前的二千五百万落后分散的个体小农户已发展为八万七千多个用先进技术装备起来的大规模的集体农庄。此外还建立了五千七百七十多个巨大的国营农场。到今年年初，全国已经建立了八千七百四十二个机器拖拉机站。全国集体农庄的80％的土地都由拖拉机站耕作。革命以前俄国农民用几百万架木犁耕作，而苏联现在单是拖拉机就有一百五十七万七千台（每台按十五马力计算）、谷物联合收割机三十八万五千台、载重汽车六十三万一千辆和数百万架其它农业机器。农业电气化也获得了巨大的进展。由于苏联社会主义农业制度和技术水平，使得苏联农业劳动生产率的发展速度大大快于资本主义国家，例如1929—1953年苏联每年平均提高6％，而美国在1930—1954年每年平均只提高2％多一点。
    农业发展的明显成就表现在播种面积和粮食产量不断增长。1957年初，苏联全国各种作物播种面积比1913年扩大了50％多，其中小麦播种面积几乎扩大了一倍，技术作物一点七倍、棉花和甜菜二倍。不仅如此，耕作技术和单位面积产量亦有极大提高。现在苏联是世界上谷物播种面积最大的国家。1956年苏联谷物播种面积达一亿二千八百三十万公顷，比美、英、法、加拿大、意大利和西德等六国的谷物播种面积的总和还要多一千三百八十万公顷。而1957年苏联谷物播种面积比去年又增加了一百五十万公顷。现在苏联的农业总产量比1913年增加了一点七倍。1956年获得了历史上空前的增产，谷物总产量比大规模垦荒以前的1953年增加了50％以上，比1955年增加了20％。在这一年，农业劳动者交售给国家的谷物就达三十三亿普特（一普特合三十二点七六市斤），各国营农场上缴给国家九亿三千三百万普特谷物，比1955年多两倍。苏联小麦的播种面积与小麦总产量均居世界首位。1955年全世界小麦播种面积共有两亿公顷，而苏联一个国家就占了六千零五十万公顷。1956年苏联的小麦总收获量比1953年增加了63％；而在同一时期，美国的小麦总收获量却减少了15％。
    苏联棉花的单位面积产量和质量、亚麻和甜菜的产量都占世界第一位。1956年苏联棉花获得了空前大丰收。在这一年，苏联棉花总产量比十月革命前增加了五倍，棉花播种面积增加了两倍。同年，苏联每公顷平均收原棉二千一百六十公斤，而美国才收一千三百五十公斤。苏联的甜菜产量早已居世界第一。单就吉尔吉斯共和国甜菜的单位面积产量已赶上美国，大大超过法、意、英和丹麦的水平。苏联在1955年生产的甜菜糖按人口分配，平均每人可分到十七公斤，比美国要多五公斤。苏联马铃薯的播种面积和收获量也占世界第一位。
    苏联近年来农业的飞速发展，是和大规模开垦生荒地和熟荒地的成就分不开的。1953年苏共中央九月全会决定急剧发展农业生产以后，便大力开垦荒地。数十万青年响应党的号召，奔向辽阔的东部地区，三年来开垦了三千五百九十万公顷生荒地和熟荒地（合五亿三千八百五十万市亩）。仅苏联东部的垦荒面积，就几乎相当于英国领土的一点五倍，等于西德、奥地利和比利时三国领土的总和。在这期间，全国播种面积几乎增加了三千八百万公顷，这比美国在1910年—1950年的四十年期间播种面积的增加额还要多。两三年内苏联至少可再开垦一千二百万公顷。
    谷物生产的发展促进了畜牧业的高涨。最近几年来，苏联畜产品的增长速度大大超过美国。苏联共产党已经提出，要在最近几年内，在肉类、牛奶和油脂的生产上按人口平均计算赶上美国。
    农业科学研究工作也有极大发展。十月革命前，全国没有一所农业科学院或农业研究所，而现在已经建立了四百五十二个农业科学院和农业科学研究所，以及将近两千个种子试验场，实验选种站和机器试验站。
    农业的发展为苏联农民创造了美好幸福的生活。农民收入不断增加，1956年全国农庄的现金收入已经比1940年增加了七百三十八亿卢布。第六个五年计划规定，要把集体农庄庄员的货币收入和实物收入至少提高40％。
    苏联农业的飞跃发展，无可争辩地表明了社会主义的强大生命力和无比的优越性。
