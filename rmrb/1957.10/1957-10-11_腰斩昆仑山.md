　　Waist-Cutting the Kunlun Mountains
　　People's Highway News Reporter Li Kaidong
    On the eve of the full opening of the world's highest Xinjiang-Tibet Highway, I rode a "Liberation" brand automobile along the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway and ascended the Kunlun Mountains. I couldn't help but feel open-minded and refreshed. Looking at the mountains in the distance, covered with white snow, majestic and steep; looking down the mountain, the new road winds upwards, cutting the snow-capped mountains into several sections. The motherland's rivers and mountains are even more magnificent.

    The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway starts from Yecheng in Xinjiang in the north and ends at Gartok in Tibet in the south, with a total length of 1,200 kilometers. The highway is adjacent to the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, and is a major highway trunk line in the western border of our country.

    Yecheng is located in southern Xinjiang and is rich in grain and cotton, especially known for its long-staple cotton. Gartok is located in the center of the Ngari region of western Tibet and produces fur and gold. Due to the lack of grain, British colonialists in the past exchanged fur for grain in equal quantities, exploiting the Tibetan people to the utmost, resulting in perennial poverty for the Tibetan people. In the past, the mineral deposits of the Kunlun Mountains were a mystery. Currently, geological survey teams are investigating along the route, and this mystery will be broken by us. Materials along the route will also be exchanged, and the economic and cultural life of the Tibetan people in the Ngari region will gradually prosper.

    The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway began surveying in January 1954. Engineer Xu Weiran led the survey team, climbing snow-capped mountains, wading through glaciers, running back and forth on cliffs, and sleeping in the open air in icy and snowy conditions, enduring all kinds of hardships. After two years, they surveyed eighteen routes of various sizes and selected this economically reasonable route.

    On March 1st of last year, Xu Luqing, commander of the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway Construction Headquarters, led the employees of the Engineering Bureau and the soldiers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' Engineering Division to start building the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway. This road required clearing eleven large slopes, seven of which were above 5,000 meters; five bridges had to be built, and many stone walls had to be traversed. The air on the mountain was thin, and most of the road builders felt dizzy, sleepless, and nauseous when they first arrived on the plateau; the climate was cold and unpredictable, with snow accumulating from November each year and melting only in June of the following year; the temperature often reached minus 30 or 40 degrees Celsius, and in some places, the temperature difference was 30 degrees Celsius in one day. However, the employees and soldiers were not afraid at all. They said, "The Kunlun Mountains are steel mountains, and we must open up a steel road; the Kunlun Mountains are iron mountains, and we must open up an iron road; the Kunlun Mountains are ice mountains, and we must open up an ice road." They drilled holes in the stone walls in mid-air, set off gourd-shaped explosive charges, and blasted hundreds or thousands of cubic meters with one shot; on the mountain ridges, they dug frozen soil and removed silt; on the glaciers, they broke open the ice layer, regardless of the bone-chilling ice water, and still went into the water to dig foundations. At the Victory Bridge, a poem is still left to this day: "Strange peaks face each other, the snowmelt rushes, wanting to speak of Kunlun, opening ice to build bridges." Communist Party member Cheng Youliang, with a blood pressure of 148 degrees, climbed mountain ridges of 4,000 meters, his face swollen, his lips blue, and his head dizzy. He could only eat one steamed bun at most per meal, but he still insisted on working. The leadership wanted him to go down the mountain to rest, but he went down the mountain and then up the mountain three times.

    Due to the difficulty of transportation at the construction site, the Kashgar Uyghur compatriots organized three thousand donkeys and camels to transport materials, but the supply still fell short of demand. From January to September this year, the supply of non-staple food was insufficient, and the employees ate soybeans every meal. The Uyghur workers did not eat soybeans, so they had to gnaw on nang (like sesame cakes). Some went to the river to catch fish and went up the mountain to hunt wild sheep to eat. They said, "The picnic in the Kunlun Mountains is better than a grand banquet."

    After nineteen months of hard work, the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway was opened to traffic. People of all ethnic groups were overjoyed and encouraged. When the Uyghur people saw cars driving up the Kunlun Mountains, they repeatedly praised, "Yakshi, Yakshi." (Uyghur: Good). When the Tibetan people saw the cars, they stepped forward to present hadas as a tribute. Automobiles will bring them happiness and bring them spring.

### 腰斩昆仑山

　　腰斩昆仑山
　　人民公路报记者　李开东
    在世界最高的新藏公路全线通车前夕，我乘坐“解放牌”汽车，沿新藏公路，登上昆仑山，不禁胸怀开朗，精神焕发。遥望群山，白雪皑皑，巍峨峻峭；俯视山下，新路逶迤而上，将雪山裁为几截。祖国河山，更加壮丽。
    新藏公路北起新疆叶城，南至西藏噶大克，全长一千二百公里，公路临近苏联、阿富汗、巴基斯坦、为印度，我国西陲公路干线。
    叶城位于南疆，盛产粮食、棉花，尤以长尾棉著称。噶大克位于西藏西部阿里地区中心，出产皮毛、黄金。由于缺少粮食，过去英国殖民主义者曾以等量粮食交换皮毛，极尽剥削之能事，以致藏民常年贫困。往昔，昆仑山矿藏是个谜，目前地质勘察队正沿线调查，这个谜将被我们打破。沿线物资也将得以交流，阿里地区藏民的经济、文化生活，将逐渐繁荣起来。
    新藏公路在1954年1月开始踏勘。徐为然工程师率领勘察队员，爬雪山，涉冰山，在悬崖峭壁上来回奔走，在冰天雪地里风餐露宿，历尽艰险。经过两年时间，他们勘测了大小十八条线路，选出了这条经济合理的路线。
    去年3月1日，新藏公路修建指挥所指挥徐鲁卿领导工程局的职工和新疆生产兵团工程处的战士，开始修筑新藏公路。这条路要打通十一个大坡，有七个大坡在五千公尺以上；要架五座桥，并且需要穿过很多石壁。山上空气稀薄，筑路人员初上高原，大多感到头晕、失眠、作呕；气候寒冷，变化无常，每年11月开始积雪，翌年6月才能融化；气温常到零下三、四十度，有的地方一天气温差三十度。可是，职工、战士毫不胆怯，他们说：“昆仑山是钢山，要开辟一条钢路；昆仑山是铁山，要开辟一条铁路；昆仑山是冰山，要开辟一条冰路。”在石壁上悬空打炮眼，放葫芦炮，一炮炸数百方或千多方；在山岭上，挖冻土，去粉砂；在冰川上，打开冰层，任凭冰水寒冷彻骨，依然下水挖基。在胜利桥头，至今还留着一首诗：“奇峰相对，雪水滔滔，欲道昆仑，开冰架桥。”共产党员呈有亮，血压一百四十八度，登上四千公尺山岭，脸发肿，嘴发青，头昏眼花，每餐顶多吃一个馍，仍坚持工作，领导上要他下山休养，他却三次下山又上山。
    由于工地运输困难，喀什维吾尔族同胞，组织了三千头毛驴、骆驼运送物资，但仍然供不应求。今年1月到9月，副食供应不足，职工餐餐吃黄豆，维吾尔族工人不吃黄豆，只好啃馕（如烧饼）。有的就下河捉鱼，上山打野羊吃。他们说：“昆仑山的野餐，胜过良宵盛筵。”
    经过十九个月的艰苦奋斗，新藏公路通车了。各族人民莫不欢欣鼓舞。维吾尔族人民见到汽车开上昆仑山，连连称赞：“牙克西，牙克西。”（维语：好）藏胞见到汽车，走上前去献哈达致敬。汽车将给他们带来幸福，带来春天。
