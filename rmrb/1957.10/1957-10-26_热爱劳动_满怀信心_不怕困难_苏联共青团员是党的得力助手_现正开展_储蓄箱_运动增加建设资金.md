    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th -- In the thirty-nine years since the founding of the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League, the number of members has grown from 22,100 to the current 18.5 million. Those absorbed into the Young Communist League include the most outstanding young workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals. They actively play the role of the Party's strong assistants in all aspects of the country's communist construction.
    The Young Communist League is the shock force led by the Party to complete the new Five-Year Plan. In recent years, approximately 200,000 young men and women have set out to construction sites in Siberia, the Far East, and the Donbass to participate in construction. With the active participation of the Young Communist League members, the Soviet Union has now built 450 new factories and workshops. Among the thirty-six new Young Communist League mines established in the Donbass based on the initiative of the Ukrainian Young Communist League, three mines have now been completed within a nine-month period. Young Communist League members have also voluntarily undertaken the obligation to build nuclear power stations, the Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station, and the Sokolovsk-Sarbay Metallurgical Plant.
    The youth's achievements in reclaiming wasteland are also well-known. In three years, led by the Young Communist League members, 50,000 young people responded to the Party's call to go to Siberia, Kazakhstan, the Urals, and the Hungry Steppe to reclaim wasteland. More than 5,000 youth tractor teams carried out labor competitions on the wasteland. In addition, in order to help with the autumn harvest in the reclaimed areas, the Young Communist League organization mobilized a total of 620,000 young people to help with harvesting in various places for two months last year and this year.
    After the Soviet Communist Party proposed the great task of catching up with the United States in the production of livestock products per capita in the next few years, the Young Communist League members in various places immediately responded enthusiastically to the Party's call and launched a competition to produce 100 centners of meat and 400 centners of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land on average.
    To welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, young people across the country have widely launched the "Young Communist League Savings Box" conservation campaign. According to calculations, if every young worker saves 100 rubles, the country can obtain 2 billion rubles from the Young Communist League members before the October Revolution holiday. Now, the "relay book" is being sent from one city to another, from one region to another, and the young League members in various places are expressing in the "relay book" that they will greet the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution with practical actions of saving raw materials and reducing costs. The Young Communist League members of the Gorky Automobile Plant launched a campaign to tap production potential and save raw materials, saving 1 million rubles in the past three months alone. The young workers of the Amur Factory also achieved good results. In July and August, each Young Communist League member saved an average of 300 rubles for the "Young Communist League Savings Box".
    When mobilizing young people to participate in communist construction, the Young Communist League organizations in various places regard the communist education of young people as a regular and important task. The League organizations adopt various methods to educate young people to love labor, be full of confidence in their careers, and be prepared to overcome all difficulties.

    热爱劳动　满怀信心　不怕困难
    苏联共青团员是党的得力助手
    现正开展“储蓄箱”运动增加建设资金
    据新华社莫斯科25日电　在苏联列宁共产主义青年团成立以来的三十九年间，团员人数已从二万二千一百人发展到现在的一千八百五十万人。被吸收加入共青团组织的包括最优秀的青年工人、集体农民和知识分子。他们在国家的共产主义建设的各项工作中积极发挥作为党的强有力的助手的作用。
    共青团是党领导下的完成新五年计划的突击队。在最近几年内，大约有二十万青年男女出发到西伯利亚、远东、顿巴斯工地参加建设。在共青团员带头积极参加下，苏联现在已经建成了四百五十个新工厂和车间。根据乌克兰共青团的创议在顿巴斯建立的三十六座新共青团员矿井中，现在，已经有三座矿井在九个月的期限内完工。共青团员还志愿承担了建设原子能发电站、布拉次克水电站以及索科洛夫斯克—萨尔巴伊冶金工厂的义务。
    青年们开垦荒地的功绩也是人所尽知的。三年间，在共青团员的带头下，有五万青年响应党的号召到西伯利亚、哈萨克、乌拉尔、饥饿草原去开荒。有五千多个青年拖拉机队在荒地上进行了劳动竞赛。另外，为了帮助开垦地区秋收，共青团组织去年和今年总共就动员了六十二万青年到各地去帮助收割两个月。
    当苏联共产党提出要在最近几年内在按人口平均计算的畜产品产量方面赶上美国的巨大任务以后，各地共青团员立即踊跃地响应了党的号召，展开了平均在每一百公顷农业用地上生产肉类一百公担、牛奶四百公担的竞赛。
    为了迎接十月革命四十周年，全国青年广泛展开了“共青团储蓄箱”的节约运动。根据计算，假如每一个青年工人节约一百卢布，国家在十月革命节前就可以从共青团员那里得到二十亿卢布。现在，“接力簿”正从这一个城市送到另一个城市，从这一地区送到另一地区，各地的青年团员们在“接力簿”上都表示要用节约原料、降低成本的实际行动来迎接十月革命四十周年。高尔基汽车厂青年团员展开了挖掘生产潜力、节约原材料运动，仅在过去三个月期间就节约一百万卢布，阿穆尔工厂的青年工人也获得了良好的结果，在七、八月间，每一个共青团员就平均给“共青团储蓄箱”贮存了三百卢布。
    各地共青团组织在动员青年参加共产主义建设时，把对青年的共产主义教育列为经常的重要工作。团组织采取各种办法教育青年热爱劳动，对事业充满信心，准备克服一切困难。
