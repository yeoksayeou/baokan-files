Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Cadres and peasants in drought-stricken areas of nine provinces, including Henan and Shandong, are fully engaged in the struggle to combat drought and sow wheat. By around October 8th, the wheat sowing area in the five provinces of Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Shanxi had increased from more than 70 million mu at the end of September and the beginning of October to more than 120 million mu. According to incomplete statistics, the four provinces of Gansu, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei had sown more than 19 million mu of wheat by the beginning of October.

Leading organs at all levels in these nine provinces attach great importance to the work of combating drought and sowing wheat. Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and other provinces have held one or two telephone conferences to instruct all localities to fully launch a campaign to combat drought and rush planting. The CPC provincial committees of Shanxi, Shandong, and other provinces have transferred a group of responsible cadres from provincial-level organs to go to the countryside to strengthen leadership in drought relief work. Various organs, enterprises, and military units have also transferred a large number of personnel to the countryside to help farmers rush planting. In Anyang and Xinxiang prefectures of Henan Province, more than 3,400 cadres from various counties have gone to the countryside to sow wheat. In Anhui Province, 3,000 cadres from directly affiliated organs and Hefei municipal organs have gone to the countryside, bringing their own water-lifting tools as much as possible. In Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, more than 10,000 cadres are working with farmers every day to dig the ground, break up soil clods to preserve moisture, and water and sow wheat.

In order to support farmers in combating drought, many areas, in addition to instructing organs, schools, enterprises, and military units to lend all water-lifting tools to farmers, have also strengthened the supply of means of production. Most of the 260,000 waterwheels supplied to farmers in Shandong Province have been allocated. The Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has supplied 15,000 horse-drawn waterwheels, 15,400 double-wheeled double-share plows, disc harrows, seeders, and more than 65 million jin of chemical fertilizers, and recently rushed to transfer more than 2,000 horse-drawn waterwheels to supply farmers.

Farmers in various places are highly motivated to combat drought and sow wheat. The labor attendance rate of agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Shandong Province is generally above 90%, and some have reached full attendance. Members of agricultural cooperatives in Zhaoyuan, Pingyuan, and other counties are working in shifts day and night to water and rush planting, with lights on all night. In Henan Province, more than 10 million farmers are mobilized every day to combat drought and sow wheat, sowing 2 million mu per day. In areas with insufficient water sources, farmers are digging wells and opening canals day and night. According to recent statistics, nearly 100,000 new wells (including a batch of temporary wells) have been dug, and 1,400 canals have been opened. In areas with poor water conservancy conditions in Gansu, many agricultural cooperative members are carrying water to plant seeds, striving to complete the wheat sowing plan.

Since August, these nine provinces have successively experienced drought, and no thorough rain has fallen after the wheat sowing season arrived. The wheat field area of ​​these nine provinces accounts for more than three-fifths of the total wheat field area in the country; it generally accounts for about 40% of the total area of ​​grain crops in each province.

### 干部群众一齐出动　夜以继日打井开渠  河南等九省开展抗旱种麦斗争

　　干部群众一齐出动　夜以继日打井开渠
    河南等九省开展抗旱种麦斗争
    新华社12日讯　河南、山东等九省干旱地区的干部和农民，正全力投入抗旱种麦的斗争。到10月8日左右，河南、山东、河北、陕西、山西五省种麦面积已由9月底10月初的七千多万亩增加到一亿二千多万亩。甘肃、江苏、安徽、湖北四省据不完全统计，在10月初已种麦一千九百万亩以上。
    这九个省的各级领导机关对抗旱种麦工作十分重视。河北、山东、河南、安徽等省已经开过一两次电话会议，指示各地要全力开展抗旱抢种运动。山西、山东等省的中共省委，从省级机关抽调了一批负责干部下乡，加强对抗旱工作的领导。各地机关、企业、部队，也都抽调大批人员下乡帮助农民抢种。河南省安阳、新乡两专区各县下乡种麦的干部达三千四百多人，安徽省直属机关和合肥市各机关下乡的三千干部，都尽可能的自带提水工具，江苏省沭阳县每天和农民在一起挖地、打土块保墒和浇水种麦的干部有一万多人。
    为了支援农民抗旱，很多地区除指示机关、学校、企业和部队把一切提水工具都借给农民外，还加强了生产资料的供应工作。山东省供应农民的二十六万部水车已经大部调拨下去，安徽省供销合作社已经供应了一万五千部马拉水车，一万五千四百多部双轮双铧犁、圆盘耙、播种机和六千五百多万斤化学肥料，最近又赶调二千多部马拉水车供应农民。
    各地农民抗旱种麦的劲头很高。山东省各地农业社的劳动出勤率一般都在90％以上，有些已经达到全勤。招远、平原等县的农业社社员，日夜轮班浇水抢种，夜间一片灯火。河南省每天出动抗旱种麦的农民，在一千万人以上，日种两百万亩。在水源不足的地方，农民们日夜打井开渠，据最近统计已打新井近十万眼（包括一批临时井），开渠一千四百来条。甘肃水利条件较差的地区，很多农业社社员担水点种，争取完成麦播计划。
    这九个省从8月以来就陆续发生了旱象，麦播季节到来以后仍然未落透雨。九个省的麦田面积共占全国麦田总面积的五分之三以上；一般都占各省粮食作物总面积的40％左右。
