　　What Kind of Initiative Should Be Aroused in Farmers?
　　Nan Cheng
    In the cooperative movement, some people are trying their best to get rid of the socialist path and retrace the old road of the past. Today, the two news items published in this newspaper from Guangdong and Zhejiang fully illustrate this fact. The wealthy middle peasants of Dongning Cooperative in Shunde, Guangdong, proposed "contracting production to individual households," but were refuted by the peasants who insisted on cooperation. In Zhejiang's Wenzhou Prefecture, individual county committee leaders erroneously promoted the management and production method of "contracting production to individual households," causing thousands of agricultural cooperatives to temporarily deviate from the socialist road and regress to the old path of decentralized management and individual farming. Exploitative phenomena such as buying and selling land, hiring labor, lending at usurious rates, and buying green crops reappeared in rural areas. Now, this mistake has been corrected, but it once again shows that the right-leaning ideology of some leading cadres is very harmful to the socialist cause.
    The reason why the erroneous method of "contracting production to individual households" was able to be implemented in many agricultural cooperatives is mainly because it suited the capitalist ideas of some wealthy middle peasants and received their active support. Since the spring of this year, the Fifth Agricultural Cooperative of Xinmiao Township in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, has been clamoring for the implementation of "three guarantees to households" (which is "contracting production to individual households"). In August, the county committee's work team went to the countryside to launch a major debate on the grain issue. The cadres and members of this cooperative demanded that the work team help them implement it, and threatened that if the work team did not help them with "three guarantees to households," they would not participate in the debate on the grain issue. It is understood that most of those who firmly demanded the implementation of "three guarantees to households" were wealthy middle peasants. They promoted the "benefits" of "three guarantees to households" everywhere, mobilized most of the cooperative members, and even influenced the township branch secretary. We know that in the period when the production of agricultural cooperatives has not yet caught up with the production level of wealthy middle peasants and has not been completely consolidated, some wealthy middle peasants with strong labor, sufficient agricultural capital, and serious capitalist ideas have always been estranged from the cooperative. They miss individual farming, look for opportunities to withdraw from the cooperative, are not active in labor within the cooperative, and cause trouble. In order to achieve the goal of individual farming, they openly and secretly promoted the "superiority" of individual farming, and even attempted to undermine the cooperative. The implementation of "contracting production to individual households" in the cooperative, which is individual farming in disguise, legally achieved their goal of "individual farming." How could they not actively welcome and firmly support it?
    While "contracting production to individual households" is welcomed by a small number of wealthy middle peasant members, the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasant members do not welcome it. They said, "We are empty-handed again." Many people have already encountered insurmountable difficulties in production and life due to the implementation of "contracting production to individual households" and have to endure exploitation again. The reason why some of them echoed "contracting production to individual households" and did not object to it was only because they were influenced by the ideas of wealthy middle peasants, or were afraid that others would say that they wanted to take advantage of the wealthy middle peasants, and had to reluctantly follow along. In fact, the vast majority of them are demanding to adhere to collective production.
    The problem is very clear: on the one hand, the majority of poor and lower-middle peasants demand to adhere to collective production, and on the other hand, a small number of wealthy middle peasants demand "contracting production to individual households" and decentralized management. Isn't this precisely a manifestation of the struggle between two roads in the countryside? Then, which side should the comrades who lead rural work stand on in front of the struggle? Is it to lead the peasants forward, or to lead the peasants backward? The individual county committee leaders of Wenzhou Prefecture lost their way here. They lacked class analysis of the specific ideological situation within the agricultural cooperative, forgot the struggle between the two roads, and mistakenly believed that "contracting production to individual households" could arouse the initiative of the peasants. Facts have proved that what they have aroused is only the individual economic initiative of a small number of wealthy middle peasants, while the socialist initiative of the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants has suffered setbacks.
    The Party's class line in the countryside is to rely on the poor peasants and unite with the middle peasants. Countless facts have proved that only by closely relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, fully exploiting their socialist initiative, and constantly overcoming the capitalist and individualistic ideas of some wealthy middle peasants can we achieve the goal of uniting with the middle peasants and fully implement the Party's class line. However, some people with right-leaning ideas understand uniting with the wealthy middle peasants as unprincipled accommodation. They neither criticize nor fight against their capitalist ideas, and even accept their ideological influence, speaking and acting from their standpoint. This will not only fail to achieve the goal of uniting with the middle peasants, but also cause great harm to the socialist cause. The mistake of "contracting production to individual households" that occurred in Wenzhou Prefecture is a lesson.

### 调动农民什么样的积极性？

　　调动农民什么样的积极性？
　　南成
    在合作化运动中，有的人竭力想摆脱社会主义的轨道，重新再走过去的回头路。今天，本报发表的广东和浙江的两则新闻，充分地说明了这个事实。广东顺德东宁社的富裕中农提出了“包产到户”的主张，被坚持合作化的农民驳倒了。浙江温州专区由于个别县委领导干部错误地推行了“包产到户”的管理生产办法，使上千个农业社一度离开了社会主义道路，倒退到了分散经营、个人单干的老路，而农村中买卖土地、雇工、放高利贷、买青苗等剥削现象，又重新出现了。现在，这个错误已经纠正，但它又一次说明，某些领导干部的右倾思想对社会主义事业的危害，是很严重的。
    “包产到户”这个错误办法所以能够在许多农业社里推行，主要原因是它正好适合部分富裕中农的资本主义思想，得到了他们的积极拥护和支持。江苏省江阴县新苗乡第五农业社从今年春天起就闹着要实行“三包到户”（也就是“包产到户”）。8月间县委工作组下乡发动粮食问题的大辩论，这个社的干部和社员要求工作组帮助他们推行，并扬言如果工作组不帮助他们搞“三包到户”，就不参加粮食问题的辩论会。据了解，坚决要求实行“三包到户”的，大部分是富裕中农。他们到处宣传“三包到户”的“好处”，把多数社员鼓动起来，使乡支部书记也受到了他们的影响。我们知道，在农业社的生产还没有赶上富裕中农的生产水平，还没有完全巩固起来的时期，一部分劳力强、农本足而资本主义思想严重的富裕中农，对合作社始终是离心离德的。他们怀念单干，寻找退社的机会，在社内劳动不积极，闹事生非。为了达到单干的目的，他们明里暗里宣传单干的“优越性”，甚至企图搞垮合作社。合作社实行“包产到户”，变相单干，使他们的“单干”目的合法的达到了，他们怎么不积极欢迎、坚决支持呢？
    “包产到户”为少数富裕中农社员所欢迎，广大的贫农、下中农社员却是不欢迎的。他们说：“我们又是赤手空拳的了”，许多人已经因为实行“包产到户”而在生产和生活上发生了不可克服的困难，又不得不重新忍受剥削。他们有些人所以对“包产到户”随声附和，不加反对，只是由于受了富裕中农的思想影响，或者是害怕别人说他们想揩富裕中农的油，而不得不勉强跟着走。实际上，他们绝大多数都是要求坚持集体生产的。
    问题是很明白的：一方面是大多数贫农、下中农要求坚持集体生产，一方面是少数富裕中农要求“包产到户”，分散经营，这不正是农村中两条道路的斗争的表现么？那么，领导农村工作的同志在斗争的前面应该站在哪一边呢？是领导农民前进呢？还是领导农民后退？温州专区个别县委领导干部在这里迷失了方向，他们对农业社内部的具体思想情况缺乏阶级分析，忘记了两条道路的斗争，错误地认为“包产到户”可以调动农民的积极性。事实证明，他们所调动起来的只是少数富裕中农个体经济的积极性，而广大贫农、下中农的社会主义积极性却遭受了挫折。
    党在农村中的阶级路线，是依靠贫农、团结中农。无数的事实证明，只有紧紧依靠贫农、下中农，充分发挥他们的社会主义积极性，不断克服部分富裕中农的资本主义和个人主义思想，才能达到团结中农的目的，完整地贯彻党的阶级路线。可是，一些有右倾思想的人，他们把团结富裕中农理解为无原则的迁就，对他们的资本主义思想既不批评，更不斗争，甚至还接受了他们的思想影响，站在他们的立场上说话、办事。这样不仅达不到团结中农的目的，而且会造成社会主义事业的极大危害。温州专区发生的“包产到户”的错误，就是一个教训。
