Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: People in many parts of the world have seen the world's first artificial satellite.

    In Australia, throughout Victoria, thousands of people saw the artificial satellite on the evening of the 7th as a pinkish light spot floating across the horizon from south-southwest to north-north-east. Because of clouds in some areas, the viewing time ranged from two and a half minutes to only twenty-five seconds.
    In eastern Australia, thousands of people also saw the satellite on the 7th. Many people in Melbourne and Sydney watched from rooftops. In Melbourne, it was visible for over a minute, and in Sydney for about thirty seconds. Thousands of residents in Canberra also saw the satellite with the naked eye. They saw the satellite for as long as three minutes, flying from south to north. Scientists said that the speed of the artificial satellite is about one-tenth the speed of a meteor. The satellite was seen everywhere in New Zealand. Many who saw it described it as a blue-white light speeding north.
    In Seattle, USA, Dr. Little, Deputy Director of the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska, and his three assistants saw the satellite with the naked eye around 5 a.m. local time on the 6th. Little said that they first saw the satellite rising in the western sky. It looked like a very slow meteor, traversing the sky along a gentle curve, gradually moving to the southeast. The western sky was dark when the satellite was in the west, and the satellite appeared particularly bright, but as the rising sun illuminated the eastern sky, the satellite's brightness clearly diminished until it could only be observed with binoculars.
    In Europe, those who saw the satellite on the 7th included a driver in Framlingham, England, two women in Stockholm, and an astronomy enthusiast in Copenhagen.
    In addition, a police officer in Malaya and an engineer in the Philippines also saw the satellite.

    各地人民争赏苏联月亮
    许多人目睹人造卫星飘然而过
    据新华社7日讯　世界许多地方有很多人看到世界第一个人造卫星。
    在澳大利亚，维多利亚州各地，有成千的人在7日晚上看到了人造卫星像粉红色光点在地平线上从南南西向北北东方向飘然而过。因为有些地方有云，看到的时间有的达两分半钟，有的只有二十五秒钟。
    在澳大利亚东部，7日也有成千的人看到了卫星。墨尔本和悉尼许多人在屋顶上看，墨尔本能看到一分多钟，悉尼能看到约三十秒钟。堪培拉也有成千居民肉眼看到卫星。他们看到卫星达三分钟之久，卫星由南往北飞去。科学家说，人造卫星运行速度约为流星速度的十分之一。新西兰所有的地方都看到了卫星。许多看到的人描述它是一道蓝白色的光向北驰去。
    在美国西雅图，阿拉斯加大学地球物理研究所副所长利特耳博士和他的三名助手在6日当地时间上午五时左右用肉眼看到了卫星。利特耳说，他们首先是在西方天空看到这个卫星升起的。它像一个很慢的流星沿着一道平缓的曲线穿过天空，逐渐向东南流去。卫星在西方时西方天空是黑暗的，卫星显得特别明亮，但是旭日东升照亮了东方天空，当卫星向东南移动时卫星光亮显然减弱，直到只能用双筒望远镜才能观测得到。
    在欧洲，7日看到卫星的有英国佛兰林汗的一个司机，斯德哥尔摩的两个妇女，哥本哈根的一个天文学爱好者。
    此外，马来亚有一个警官、菲律宾有一个工程师也看到了卫星。
