　　The Harvest of Thought
　　By our correspondent Yan Ling
    The train travels southwest from Tianjin. Looking out the window, there are large expanses of golden fields. Golden rice paddies, golden sunflowers; in each threshing ground, piles of golden grain stalks and corn cobs...

    This is the territory of Jinghai County, a water network area composed of the South Canal, Ziya River, Daqing River, Duliujian River, and Machangjian River. In the past, floods often tormented the people here, leaving them displaced and helpless. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the farmers here have organized to march towards nature—transforming the low-lying areas. The vast floods and barren alkaline land have shrunk year by year, and what has emerged is the endless expansion of rice paddies year by year.

    The comrades of the county party committee estimate that this year is a moderately good harvest.

    "How is the harvest?" This is not only a major economic issue, but also a sharp political issue that appears before people. Socialism requires that the estimation of the harvest be as close to the truth as possible, so as to make the most appropriate arrangements for the country's construction and the people's lives; capitalism, however, tries every possible means to conceal the true harvest, in order to muddy the waters—in order to facilitate the retention of more grain for grain speculation, in order to undermine the cooperatives, some people used the same slogan: "The harvest is bad!"

    The struggle around the "harvest issue" has long been underway. This year, Jinghai County has not suffered from floods, which is a rare good thing here. However, from spring to summer, the countercurrent of capitalism temporarily flooded; in the ideological field, socialist seedlings were once "affected by disaster and suffered a poor harvest." This is the result of relaxing the ideological "low-lying area transformation" in the past period.

    After the basic realization of agricultural cooperation in the county, political and ideological work was not strengthened but weakened. The rural party organizations, which were the fortresses of socialist ideology, had their combat effectiveness decline to such an extent before this great debate unfolded: out of more than six thousand one hundred rural party members in the county, more than one thousand eight hundred were passive in their work, including more than one thousand one hundred who echoed capitalist remarks and had resistance to cooperation and grain issues, and eight hundred and twenty-three who did not work at all. It is no wonder that this county became the most prominent place in the wave of grain disturbances and cooperative withdrawals that occurred in some areas of Hebei Province in the first half of this year.

    "They made a real frenzy at that time!" Comrade Zhang Jinyi, an official of the County Party Committee's Rural Work Department, told me, "In March and April, some days, dozens of people came to us every day, asking for approval to withdraw from the cooperative, or asking to register for withdrawal after the autumn harvest; some went to the prefectural party committee, the provincial party committee, and the Central Rural Work Department. They all shouted in unison, 'Production has decreased, and life is difficult.' 'There is not enough grain to eat, it is better to work alone!' More than eighty incidents of unwarranted disturbances and beatings of cadres occurred. Incidents of grabbing the cooperative's land, pulling livestock from the cooperative, and taking farm tools happened from time to time. We received phone calls from time to time—reporting that such things had happened below, asking how to deal with them. The constant troubles made it almost impossible for us to work. Even in June and July, sometimes people came to us asking to withdraw from the cooperative. In these months, a total of more than one thousand households formally applied to withdraw from the cooperative (about three hundred households were approved), and more than three thousand cooperative members (out of a total of seventy-two thousand households in the county) had serious ideological wavering. Two cooperatives, Xiaohuzhuang (forty-six households) and Xiaoqizhuang (thirty-five households), collapsed..."

    Comrade Niu Wenqi, a researcher in the County Party Committee Office, told me: "At that time, individual households also became arrogant. (Including those who withdrew from the cooperative, there were more than three thousand individual households in the county.) Individual households could do small businesses at will, so they deliberately bought snacks to eat in front of cooperative members, comparing themselves with some cooperative members who ate corn cakes. In order to fight against the cooperative, individual households deliberately put extra effort and investment into small plots of land in places where people could easily see them; the cooperative had a lot of land and could not generally use more labor and investment, so looking at this small plot of land alone was indeed not as good as the individual households. Individual households stood by the land and satirized cooperative members. Some individual households even said to cooperative members: 'Whoever transplants two acres of rice seedlings for me, I will give them two boxes of Hengda cigarettes.' They induced cooperative members to abandon the cooperative's farm work to work for them. In some places, individual households even separately elected 'village directors' and engaged in a separate set of 'administration.' Some individual households did not hand in the requisitioned grain according to regulations, and also elected 'representatives' to make trouble at the People's Committee, demanding less grain to be handed in..."

    They also told me: At that time, many cooperative members abandoned agriculture and went into business. Some cooperatives abandoned large areas of land. Han Jingu from Wangkou Township, tempted by others, sold his family's belongings and took his wife and children to Tianjin to do small business. At first, he made some money, and he was very proud. Later, it didn't work out, and he lost his capital. When his wife saw this situation and thought that she had not earned work points in the cooperative and could not go back, she divorced him and took the child to find her own way out. In the end, he had to return to the cooperative alone in a dejected manner....

    At that time, the grain disturbances were also quite "tense." In many villages, many people surrounded the cooperative cadres to demand grain. Many township and cooperative cadres also believed that "grain is really too tight." During the wheat harvest season, many cooperatives concealed production and privately divided grain....

    At that time, there were also some loyal socialist fighters who stood their ground. Three hundred and eighty-four cooperatives finally persevered. Some cooperative cadres who were beaten in the "high tide" of grain and cooperative disturbances were not discouraged at all. The temptation, provocation, satire, and attacks of capitalist forces did not crush the socialist cause. However, from the county to the township to the cooperative, many comrades could not help but worry and wonder: What kind of situation will emerge after the autumn harvest? Didn't many cooperative members declare that they would withdraw from the cooperative after the autumn harvest and had already "registered"? Weren't there also many party members and cadres who could not withstand the temptation and attacks and became demoralized, even declaring that they would "retire" after the autumn harvest? Didn't many townships always "deny" grain production? ...

    "After the autumn harvest" became a somewhat frightening and somewhat mysterious time in people's minds for a while. The scenes of harvest in the fields made people feel somewhat comfortable, but the scenes of poor harvest in thought made people feel somewhat depressed. What should be done in the end?

    "I didn't expect a great debate to come, it really solved the problem!" Now, many people say this frankly and excitedly. A series of question marks suddenly have answers.

    In fact, the debate has long been going on among the masses. When some individual households boasted "working alone, fragrant oil and white flour," some cooperative members who had firm confidence in the future of the cooperative resolutely answered them: "Working alone, sooner or later it will be over!" When individual households used their specially cultivated small plots of well-grown crops to satirize the cooperative, some cooperatives also used the collective strength to process and fertilize the crops to grow even better. When individual households were nearby, some cooperative members stroked the heavy ears of grain, seemingly talking to themselves, and said, "Our crops just grow well!" The kind of thing that Han Jingu went to Tianjin to do small business and "lost his wife and broke his army" has also long aroused debates among the masses about whether it is good to abandon agriculture and go into business. ... In spontaneous debates, sparks of truth and wisdom flashed; but after all, they were very sporadic or too weak, and did not form a prairie fire that would burn down capitalist weeds.

    The masses urgently need leadership. - The wisdom of the masses plus correct leadership, an invincible force appeared like a leap.

    On August 8, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on conducting a large-scale socialist education for the entire rural population. The central topics of education are precisely cooperation and grain issues, and the method is also a great debate. Precisely because the instructions came from the masses, they received a wide response so quickly when they went to the masses, showing great strength.

    The led great debate in the countryside of Jinghai County began in mid-August.

    People who have achieved a bumper harvest in transforming low-lying areas are determined to achieve new victories in transforming ideological low-lying areas. We must make both thought and crops harvest together.

    Precisely because there was a period of time when the socialist political atmosphere in Jinghai County was relatively thin, the combat effectiveness of the party's grassroots organizations declined, and the countercurrent of capitalism was able to take advantage of the opportunity. To do a good job in the "drainage project" on this "low-lying area," we must first strengthen the combat effectiveness of the party organization and form a vigorous socialist revolutionary vigor among party members.

    The debate first unfolded within the Party and the League. More than five thousand party members, more than four thousand League members, and more than three thousand grassroots activists first participated in the great debate, underwent preliminary training in the struggle, and formed a socialist backbone team of more than ten thousand people. Capitalist tendencies, departmentalism, and individualism were criticized in the debate. More than two thousand party members who originally had wavering positions and passive work gradually strengthened their socialist positions, and most actively participated in the work; most of the more than eight hundred party members who originally had resistance to cooperation and grain policies clarified the major issues of right and wrong, and began to muster the courage to defend socialism and build socialism. The twelve party members of Daduzhuang, Xiaodianzi Township, originally had only four who supported socialism and actively worked, five who were ideologically unstable and slack in their work, and three with serious capitalist ideas and illegal and undisciplined behaviors; out of twenty-six League members, only four participated in the work, and the rest did not work at all. After the education of the working group and the debate within the Party and the League, except for one party member who still did not understand, most people recognized the basic situation of the two-road struggle in the countryside, and realized how dangerous a path they were taking or were about to take. They also automatically reported the concealment and private distribution of more than three thousand five hundred catties of grain.

    In this intra-Party debate alone, the "harvest" of the summer harvest—the county's wheat production this year—increased by more than five hundred thousand catties compared to what the townships and cooperatives had reported to the county in the past. According to the understanding of eighteen cooperatives in six townships including Dongtantou and Xiaodianzi, after this debate, the "harvest" of this year's autumn grain increased by more than thirty thousand catties compared to the original report to the higher authorities. These facts, in turn, educated more cadres with right-leaning ideas. The ideology within the Party became more and more unified, and the combat effectiveness became stronger and stronger.

    Then, under the leadership of the county and township working groups and grassroots party organizations, a great debate on the two roads in the countryside was launched among the entire rural population (including individual farmers) in more than eighty villages (there are more than four hundred villages in the county); at the same time, general socialist propaganda was carried out in other villages (villages without the leadership of the working group), and small debates were conducted in the way of "debating whatever is being done at the moment."

    Just a preliminary launch of the great debate in some villages has changed the atmosphere in the entire rural area. Just as the evil atmosphere in the spring spread from some "points" to form a "chain reaction," now the positive atmosphere is also expanding from some "points" in the form of a "chain reaction."

　　思想的丰收
　　本报记者  燕凌
    列车由天津向西南行进。从车窗望出去，是大片大片的金黄色的田野。金黄色的稻田，金黄色的向日葵；一个个打谷场里，一堆堆金黄的谷秸和玉米棒，……
    这里是静海县境地，是南运河、子牙河、大清河、独流减河、马厂减河等构成的水网地带。过去，大水常把这里的人们欺侮得颠沛流离，莫可奈何。近几年，这里的农民在党的领导下组织起来向大自然进军——改造洼地，汪洋的大水和荒芜的碱地一年比一年缩小了，新出现的是望不到边的一年比一年扩大的稻田。
    县委的同志们估计，今年是中常偏丰的年景。
    “年景如何？”这不仅是一个重大的经济问题，也作为一个尖锐的政治问题出现在人们面前。社会主义要求对年景的估计尽可能地接近真实，以便对国家的建设和人民的生活作最妥善的安排；资本主义却千方百计要把真实的年景掩盖起来，以便混水摸鱼——为了便于多留粮食进行粮食投机，为了便于搞垮合作社，一些人用了同一个口号：“年景不好！”
    围绕着“年景问题”的斗争，早就在进行着。今年，静海县没有遭受水灾，这在这里是难得的好事。可是，从春到夏，资本主义的逆流一时泛滥起来；在思想田野上，社会主义的禾苗却一度“受灾歉收”。这是在过去一个时期放松了思想上的“洼地改造”的结果。
    全县基本实现农业合作化以后，政治思想工作没有随着加强而是削弱了。作为社会主义思想的堡垒的农村党组织，在这次大辩论展开之前，战斗力衰退到了这样的程度：全县农村党员总共有六千一百多名，工作消极的就有一千八百多人，其中对资本主义言论随声附和、在合作化和粮食问题上有抵触情绪的就有一千一百多人，根本不干工作的有八百二十三人。这就难怪这个县今年上半年在河北省部分地区发生的闹粮退社风潮中成为浪头最突出的地方。
    “那一阵子，他们闹得真疯狂！”县委农村工作部干事张金义同志告诉我，“3、4月间，有些天，每天有几十个人来找我们，要求批准他们退社，或者要求挂号到秋后退社；到地委、省委和中央农村工作部去的也有。他们一致地喊叫‘减产了，生活困难。’‘粮食不够吃，不如单干好！’无端取闹殴打干部的事情发生了八十多起。抢种社里的地、到社里拉牲口、拿农具的事情时常发生。我们不时接到电话，——下边的干部报告发生了这样的事，问该怎样处理。不断头地闹，闹得我们简直没法工作了。直到6、7月间，有时候还有人来找我们，要求退社。这几个月，正式提出要退社的总共有一千多户（批准的有三百多户），思想严重动摇的社员有三千多户（全县社员共七万二千多户）。小胡庄（四十六户）小齐庄（三十五户）两个社垮了。……”
    县委办公室研究员牛文岐同志告诉我：“那时候，单干户也嚣张起来了。（包括退社户在内，全县有三千多户单干户。）单干户能随便做小买卖，就故意买点心在社员面前吃，同一些吃饽饽的社员比。单干户为了同合作社斗争，故意在人们容易看到的地方在小块地上特别下工夫下本钱；社里地多，不能普遍多用工多投资，单看这一小块地确实比不上单干户的。单干户就站在地边讽刺社员。有的单干户还对社员说：“谁给我插二亩秧，我就给谁两盒恒大烟。”引诱社员放弃社里的农活去给他做活。有的地方单干户甚至单独选‘村主任’，另搞一套‘行政’。有些单干户不按规定交征购粮，还推选‘代表’到人民委员会闹，要求少交。……”
    他们还告诉我：那时候，不少社员弃农经商去了。有些社废弃了大片的土地。王口乡有个韩金贵，受了别人的引诱，把家里东西卖了，带上老婆孩子到天津去做小买卖。起初，赚了些钱，他很得意。后来，就不行了，赔了老本。老婆看到这情形，想到在社里没做工分，回家也不行，就跟他离了婚，带着小孩自寻出路去了。他最后不得不孤单单灰溜溜地又回到社里……。
    那时候，闹粮食也闹得够“紧张”的。许多村子里有不少人围着社干部要粮食。许多乡、社干部也认为“粮食真是太紧了”。麦收时节，许多社发生了瞒产私分的事……。
    那时候，也有一些赤胆忠心的社会主义战士坚守着阵地。三百八十四个社终于坚持下来了。一些在闹粮闹社“高潮”中挨了打的社干部，一点也不灰心丧气。资本主义势力的引诱、挑拨、讽刺、打击都没有摧垮社会主义事业。可是，从县里到乡里、社里，不少同志不能不忧愁地担心地想着：秋后究竟会出现一个什么局面？许多社员不是早宣称秋后要退社而且已经“挂号”了吗？不是也有许多党员和干部经不起引诱和打击而消沉起来甚至宣称秋后要“退休”了吗？粮食产量不总是有许多乡“不认账”吗？……
    “秋后”，一时在人们心里成了有些可怕也有些神秘的时间。田野上的丰收景象使人心情有些舒畅，思想上的歉收景象却使人心情有些郁闷。到底应该怎么办？
    “没想到来了一个大辩论，真解决问题！”现在，许多人都爽快地兴奋地这样说。一连串问号忽然都有了答案。
    其实，辩论早就在群众中间进行着。当一些单干户夸口“单干单干，香油白面”的时候，一些对合作社的前途有坚定的信心的社员毅然地回答了他们：“单干单干，早晚完蛋！”单干户用他们特意加工培育的一小片长得好的庄稼讽刺合作社的时候，有些合作社也就运用集体的力量加工加肥把庄稼培育得更好，趁单干户在旁边的时候，有的社员用手抚摩着沉甸甸的穗子似乎是自言自语地说：“俺这庄稼，就是长得好！”韩金贵上天津做小买卖“赔了夫人又折兵”之类的事，也早已在群众中引起了弃农经商好不好等等的辩论。……自发的辩论中，闪烁着真理和智慧的火花；可是，毕竟很零星或者太微弱，没有形成烧毁资本主义的杂草的燎原之火。
    群众迫切地需要领导。——群众的智慧加上正确的领导，无坚不摧的力量就飞跃一般地出现了。
    8月8日，中共中央发出了关于向全体农村人口进行一次大规模的社会主义教育的指示。教育的中心题目正是合作化、粮食等问题，方式也正是大辩论。正因为指示是从群众中来的，所以它到群众中去的时候是那样快就得到了广泛的响应，显示了巨大的力量。
    静海县农村里的有领导的大辩论是在8月中旬开始的。
    改造洼地取得丰收的人们，决心在改造思想洼地上取得新的胜利。要叫思想和庄稼一齐丰收。
    正是因为曾经有一个时期在静海县社会主义的政治空气比较稀薄，党的基层组织战斗力衰退了，资本主义的逆流就得以乘虚而入。要做好这个“洼地”上的“排水工程”，就先要加强党组织的战斗力，在党员中形成蓬蓬勃勃的社会主义革命的朝气。
    辩论先在党内团内展开了。五千多名党员、四千多名团员、三千多名群众积极分子首先参加了大辩论，在斗争中经受了初步的锻炼，形成了一支一万多人的社会主义骨干队伍。资本主义倾向、本位主义和个人主义思想在争辩中受到了批判。原来立场动摇、工作消极的二千多名党员逐渐坚定了社会主义立场，大部分积极参加工作了；原来对合作化和粮食政策有抵触情绪的八百多名党员，大部分辨清了大是大非，开始鼓起了保卫社会主义、建设社会主义的勇气。小甸子乡大杜庄的十二个党员，原先拥护社会主义、积极工作的只有四个，思想不坚定、工作松懈的五个，有严重的资本主义思想和违法乱纪行为的三名；二十六个团员，只有四个参加工作，其余的全不工作。经过工作组的教育和党内团内的辩论，除了一个党员仍然思想不通以外，绝大部分人认清了农村中两条道路斗争的基本形势，醒悟自己正在走向或者走上了一条多么危险的道路。他们还自动报出了瞒产私分三千五百多斤粮食的事情。
    光是在这次党内辩论中，夏收的“年景”——全县今年麦子的产量，就比过去各乡各社向县里报告的增多了五十多万斤。又据东滩头、小甸子等六个乡十八个社的了解，经过这次辩论，今年秋季的“年景”——秋粮的产量比原来向上级报告的增多了三万多斤。这样一些事实，反转来又教育了更多有右倾思想的干部。党内思想越来越统一了，战斗力越来越强了。
    接着，在县和乡的工作组和基层党组织领导下，在八十多个村子里（全县总共有四百多个村子），在全体农村人口（包括单干农民）中间展开关于农村两条道路的大辩论；同时，在别的村子里（没有工作组领导的村子里）进行了一般的社会主义宣传，又以“当前做什么就辩论什么”的方式进行小辩论。
    只是在一部分村子里初步展开了大辩论，全县农村的空气就都变了。正像春天邪气是从一些“点”扩散开去形成“连锁反应”的情形一样，现在正气也从一些“点”以“连锁反应”的形式扩张着。
                                  （未完待续）
