    A Furnace of Molten Iron
    ——An Account of the Rectification Campaign
    Han Yiping
Twenty pairs of eyes stared at the tuyere. The temperature of the molten iron could not be raised. Twenty pairs of eyes watched the molten iron, and a cold storm swirled in the hearts of the foundry workers. This was the second furnace opening, but the molten iron still couldn't reach the bottom of the mold. A thousand "levels" were unusable, a thousand pounds of weight pressing on the hearts of the foundry workers. Everyone's heart seemed to have been thrown into the furnace, everyone hoping the molten iron could boil even more, but the molten iron flowed like slow-moving liquid gold. The foundry workers stood around the molten iron in silence. “If only Director Lao Zhao could come!” He had been busy by the side of the cupola furnace for forty years. Just as people were anxiously waiting, Lao Zhao walked into the workshop, wearing the starlight. Like a beacon in the night for a sailor, like a signal of victory piercing the sky, the spirits of the foundry workers lifted.
  “This time we can count on a savior!” Lao Zhao suggested changing the tuyere of the furnace, not letting the cold wind blow directly into the hot hearth, but turning the strong wind into underground magma, spraying from the bottom of the furnace all the way to the top. Ah! The flames on the furnace shot up, like ten thousand sharp arrows shooting out from the cracks in the rocks. This furnace of molten iron indeed boiled even more, as white as snowflakes, as bright as a cluster of stars. For the first time in two years, the furnace master held Lao Zhao's hands tightly, unwilling to let go. "Comrades, how much we hope you come down often!" Two huge figures embraced in the red light.

    一炉铁水
    ——整风纪事
    韩忆萍二十双眼睛盯着风口铁水的温度总是提不高二十双眼睛望着铁水铸工的心上卷着冰冷的风暴。已经是第二次开炉了可是铁水还灌不到模底一千只“水平”都不能用一千斤重量压在铸工的心里。人人的心也都像投进了熔炉人人盼着铁水能加倍沸腾可是铁水总像金液缓慢地流铸工们围着铁水默不作声。“主任老赵能来就好了！”他曾四十年忙碌在化铁炉边。正当人们焦急地盼望老赵披着星光走进了车间。像航海者黑夜见到标灯像一颗胜利的讯号划破天空铸工们的精神振作起来了
  “这回可算是盼来了救兵！”老赵建议改变了熔炉的风口不叫冷风直吹火热的炉膛让劲风变成地下的岩浆从炉底一直喷到炉上。呵！炉上的火焰冲起来了犹如石缝中射出的万只利箭这炉铁水果然加倍沸腾白得像片雪，亮的像群星。两年来，炉师傅第一次握住老赵的双手不肯分开“伙伴们多么盼望你常下来呵！”一对巨大的身影在红光里拥抱起来。
