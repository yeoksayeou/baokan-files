Famous Generals Discuss the Battle

After the match between the Japanese football team and the Beijing team, our reporter interviewed some of China's famous football players, who expressed their views on the game.

Li Fenglou, a famous center forward of thirty years ago and now Deputy Director of the Ball Games Department of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, said: The Japanese team played very well in this game. Every player played actively, proactively, and tenaciously. After their ball was intercepted by the opponent, the defenders immediately retreated to the penalty area, closely marking the opponent's forwards. The forwards actively stepped forward to intercept and obstruct, disrupting the opponent's offensive organization. The Japanese team's attacks were all on the right side. The mutual support and one-pass-one-cut between right forward Hiroshi Ninomiya and the two wings, Akira Kitaguchi and Isao Iwabuchi, were fast and had strong penetration, posing a great threat to the Beijing team.

The Beijing team played very well in this game in terms of passing between players, tacit understanding, controlling the midfield, and shooting. However, they played too hastily, and there were some shortcomings in using the two wings for endline attacks and the midfield defenders and midfielders assisting in the attack. Otherwise, they could have scored one or two more goals.

Dai Linjing, instructor of the "August 1st" football team, said: In this game, the Japanese football team performed better in both midfield assists and forward breakthroughs than they did against the "August 1st" team. Especially after they took the lead with a goal at the beginning, they adopted a dense defense. The players marked closely in the penalty area, making it difficult for the Beijing team to find gaps to shoot calmly. Their many fierce shots were also blocked by them.

The Beijing team's forwards were not fast enough in their attacks, and most of their long passes were long passes from the defenders, so the opponents were already prepared in the penalty area when they organized many attacks.

Shigeo Yaegashi, the center forward of the Japanese team, is a good offensive organizer. Right back Ryozo Hiraki played steadily and was good at disrupting the opponent's attacks. Goalkeeper Yoshio Furukawa made many saves of the opponent's fierce shots. He deserves a lot of credit for the Japanese team only losing one goal.

He Jiatong, instructor of the Shanghai football team, said: From the two games, it can be seen that the Japanese team is a well-trained team, and the players' speed and stamina are not bad. Their offense is mainly fast breaks, although the number of times is not many, but the threat is very great. In this game, they were suppressed by the Beijing team's fierce attacks and failed to exert their full offensive power. If they had attacked with full force, the threat would have been even greater.

The Beijing team also played well, but the excessive dribbling and lateral passes affected the speed of the attack. In addition, there were fewer crossover switches and runs, which is also one of the reasons why the game almost ended in a tie.

Famous goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu said: Japanese goalkeeper Yoshio Furukawa is an excellent goalkeeper. He is accurate in his judgment, experienced, and in excellent position. Many of our fierce shots were caught and saved by him.

    名将论战
    在日本足球队对北京队比赛结束后，记者访问了我国的一些足球名将，他们发表了对比赛的看法。
    三十年前的著名中锋、现任国家体委球类司副司长李凤楼说：日本队这场比赛打得很好，每个队员都踢得积极、主动、顽强。他们在球被对方截得后，后卫立即退守禁区，紧盯住对方前锋。前锋积极上前抢截、阻挠，破坏对方的组织进攻。日本队在发动进攻时都在右边，右锋二宫宽、两翼北口晃、岩渊功的互相接应和一传一切，速度快、突破力强，给北京队的威胁很大。
    北京队在这场比赛中，队员间的传球、默契、控制中场球和射门都很好，只是打得较急躁，利用两翼端线进攻和中场的后卫、前卫助攻都有些缺点，不然很可能多攻入一、两个球。
    “八一”足球队指导戴麟经说：日本足球队这场比赛中，无论在中场助攻和锋线的突破都比对“八一”队时出色。特别是他们在一开始先赢一球后，采用了密集的防守，队员在禁区内死盯死缠，使北京队很难找到空隙从容起脚，多次猛射也都被他们挡出。
    北京队前锋进攻不够快，长传球又多是后卫一脚远传，因此在多次组织进攻时，对方早站在禁区内作好准备。
    日本队的中锋八重樫茂生是一个很好的进攻组织者。右后卫平木隆三踢得稳，又善于破坏对方的进攻。门将古川好男多次扑出对方的猛射，日本队仅输一球他的功劳不小。
    上海足球队指导何家统说：在两场比赛中可以看出日本队是一支训练有素的队，队员的速度、体力都不差。他们的进攻主要是快攻，虽然次数不多，但威胁很大。在这场比赛中由于被北京队的猛攻压住，未能发挥全部力量进攻，如全部力量进行攻击，则威胁更大。
    北京队踢得也好，只是由于带球和横传球过多，影响了进攻速度。另外交叉换位和跑动都较少，这也是险些打成平局的原因之一。
    著名守门员张俊秀说：日本队守门员古川好男是一个出色的守门员，他判断准确，经验丰富，位置站得极好，我们好几次的猛射都被他接住和扑出。
