Xinhua News Agency, 14th. Beijing Intermediate People's Court held a sentencing rally at Zhongshan Park Concert Hall this afternoon to punish criminal offenders. Cai Zhongyu and Zhang Youcheng, guilty of raping and murdering young girls; He Daheng, Liu Shaohua, and Han Yonghe, leaders of a hooligan gang guilty of gang rape; and counter-revolutionary criminals Zhu Hua and Ma Yunkuan, along with seven other heinous criminals, were sentenced to death at the rally.

He Zhanjun, President of the Beijing Intermediate People's Court, also announced at the meeting that the death sentences recently handed down by the relevant courts in Beijing to Cai Jinsheng (robbery and murder), Yao Zhongxiang (rape and murder of a young girl), Gao Deqi (murder for resisting socialist transformation), and Wang Shutian (counter-revolutionary murder), had been approved by the Supreme People's Court and would be carried out on the same day.

More than 4,000 people attended the sentencing rally.

The rapist and murderer of young girls, Cai Zhongyu, raped a six-year-old girl in early August this year and then deliberately molested eight-year-old Li Xuewen. While raping Li Xuewen, Li Xuewen struggled and resisted, and Cai Zhongyu inhumanely strangled Li Xuewen to death before defiling her. The criminal Zhang Youcheng raped his fourteen-year-old niece, Zhao Chunhua, in 1952. After Zhao Chunhua married Liu Haikun last July, Zhang Youcheng plotted to murder Liu Haikun in an attempt to occupy Zhao Chunhua permanently. On the night of April 28 this year, Zhang Youcheng went to Liu Haikun's home and injured Liu with a knife before fleeing. On the morning of May 25, he went to the workers' dormitory to murder Liu Haikun, mistakenly identifying worker Cai Runsheng as Liu Haikun, and shot and killed Cai Runsheng. The Beijing Intermediate People's Court announced the death penalty for these two criminals.

The criminals He Daheng, Liu Shaohua, and Han Yonghe were the leaders of a hooligan gang. This gang of ten hooligans repeatedly chased and insulted women in Tiananmen Square, the Working People's Cultural Palace, Dongdan Park, Tianqiao, and other places. They also ganged up to steal and fight, severely disrupting social order in the capital. On July 29 this year, led by criminals He Daheng, Liu Shaohua, and Han Yonghe, they forcibly gang-raped a female worker surnamed Zhang in Dongdan Park. The Beijing Intermediate People's Court sentenced the three criminals, He Daheng, Liu Shaohua, and Han Yonghe, to death and sentenced the other seven criminals in the hooligan gang to life imprisonment or long-term imprisonment.

The counter-revolutionary Zhu Hua began planning and organizing the counter-revolutionary organization "Yiyuanhui" in 1952, formulating reactionary political programs such as "implementing people's autonomy" and "restoring the old Chinese system," in an attempt to subvert the people's government. In 1955, Zhu Hua and counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Xunmin and Kong Xiao repeatedly conducted secret planning, attempting to make contact with American imperialists. The conspiracy of this gang of counter-revolutionaries was arrested by our public security organs before it could be realized.

Guo Buyue, Chief Procurator of the Beijing People's Procuratorate, spoke at the sentencing rally. He pointed out that the broad masses of the people urgently demand that the people's government exercise resolute and merciless dictatorship over these beasts in human skin and counter-revolutionary elements. This demand of the people is entirely correct. The political and legal organs of the capital will, with the support of the broad masses of the people, fulfill their responsibilities, exercise merciless dictatorship over bad elements and counter-revolutionary elements, and resolutely safeguard the smooth progress of the capital's construction and the happy life of the people.

　　坚决镇压坏分子和反革命分子
    北京一批罪大恶极的犯罪分子被判处死刑
    新华社14日讯　北京市中级人民法院14日下午在中山公园音乐堂举行惩治刑事犯罪分子宣判大会。强奸幼女杀人犯蔡仲瑜、张有成，流氓轮奸犯何大衡、刘绍华、韩永和，反革命罪犯朱华、马云宽等七个罪大恶极的犯罪分子已在会上被判处死刑。
    北京市中级人民法院院长贺战军还在会上宣布，最近经北京市有关法院判处死刑的盗窃杀人犯蔡金生、强奸幼女杀人犯姚仲祥、抗拒社会主义改造杀人犯高德起、反革命杀人犯王书田等案已经最高人民法院核准，当天执行死刑。
    有四千多人参加了这次宣判大会。
    强奸幼女杀人犯蔡仲瑜今年8月上旬强奸了一个六岁幼女之后，又蓄意奸淫八岁幼女李学文。在强奸幼女李学文时，李学文挣扎反抗，蔡仲瑜竟毫无人性地先将李学文掐死，而后进行奸污。罪犯张有成，在1952年强奸了当时只有十四岁的外甥女赵春华。去年7月赵春华与刘海昆结婚后，张有成就蓄谋杀害刘海昆，企图长期霸占赵春华。今年4月28日夜，张有成到刘海昆家用刀将刘砍伤后逃跑。5月25日晨他去工人宿舍谋害刘海昆，误认工人蔡润生就是刘海昆，于是开枪杀死了蔡润生。北京市中级人民法院宣布对这两名罪犯判处死刑。
    罪犯何大衡、刘绍华和韩永和是一个流氓集团的头目。这个有十个人的流氓集团，屡次在天安门、劳动人民文化宫、东单公园、天桥等地追逐和侮辱妇女，并且四处结伙偷窃，打架斗殴，严重地破坏了首都的社会秩序。今年7月29日，以罪犯何大衡、刘绍华、韩永和为首，竟在东单公园强行轮奸了一个姓张的女工。北京市中级人民法院判处何大衡、刘绍华、韩永和三个罪犯以死刑；并分别判处这个流氓集团的其他七名犯罪分子以无期徒刑或长期徒刑。
    反革命分子朱华，从1952年开始策划组织反革命组织“一元会”，拟定了“实行人民自治”、“恢复中国旧制”等反动政治纲领，妄图颠覆人民政权。1955年，朱华与反革命分子张勋民、孔晓多次进行秘密策划，企图与美帝国主义分子取得联系。这一伙反革命分子的阴谋没有来得及实现就被我公安机关逮捕。
    北京市人民检察院检察长郭步岳在宣判大会上讲了话。他指出，广大人民群众迫切要求人民政府对这些披着人皮的野兽坏分子和反革命分子实行坚决无情的专政。人民群众的这种要求是完全正确的。首都的政法机关一定在广大人民群众的支持下，尽自己的职责，对坏分子和反革命分子实行无情的专政，坚决地保卫首都建设的顺利进行和人民的幸福生活。
