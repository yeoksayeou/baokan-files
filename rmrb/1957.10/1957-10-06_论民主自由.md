On Democracy and Freedom
    Liao Gailong

One of the most important political slogans used by bourgeois rightists to launch a frenzied attack on the Communist Party and the socialist cause is the so-called "struggle for democracy, struggle for freedom." They falsely claim that our socialist country has no democracy or freedom, and that only Western bourgeois countries have democracy and freedom. The agitation carried out by rightists in the name of "democracy" and "freedom" has been echoed in political circles (various democratic parties), intellectual circles, and industrial and commercial circles by some people with bourgeois anti-people abstract democratic ideas or petty-bourgeois reactionary anarchist ideas. This has created a wave of anti-communist and anarchist fervor.

Now, as the struggle to reason with bourgeois rightists unfolds, even those who temporarily echoed the rightists' anti-socialist activities have begun to realize the political deceptiveness of the rightists' so-called struggle for "democracy and freedom." Where are they struggling for the democracy and freedom of the people? On the contrary, they want to fundamentally eliminate the democracy and freedom of the people, fundamentally change our country's political system, and thus re-establish the reactionary exploiting class's bloody enslavement rule over the people of the whole country.

However, politically recognizing the ugly stance of bourgeois rightists opposing the democracy and freedom of the people is one thing; thoroughly recognizing the deceptiveness and reactionary nature of their abstract "democracy and freedom" propaganda in thought is another. In this regard, many people still have this or that problem that has not been completely clarified, which requires us to discuss these issues.

Democracy and freedom both have specific class content

The deceptive propaganda carried out by the bourgeoisie for a long time has created a concept of mythicizing, abstracting, and absolutizing "democracy and freedom" among many people, especially many intellectuals. The democracy and freedom they imagine are absolutely good things, things without a certain class content. Unlike these people, bourgeois rightists fully understand the class content of the "democracy and freedom" they demand. Therefore, they consciously use the prejudice of people's minds that superstitious abstract "democracy and freedom" to carry out their despicable anti-socialist conspiracy.

There has never been abstract democracy and freedom that treats all classes equally in the world, but only concrete democracy and freedom, that is, democracy and freedom with specific class content. Historically, there has been bourgeois democracy that replaced the autocratic rule of the feudal landlord class, and there has been proletarian democracy, that is, socialist democracy, that replaced the democratic rule of the bourgeoisie. As for general "democracy" without specific class content, it has never existed, and it is also impossible.

What is democracy? Democracy is a national political system, a means by which a specific class adjusts its internal contradictions, unites its strength, and systematically enforces violent dictatorship against its hostile classes. As a national political system, democracy is also dictatorship, or more precisely, democracy with specific class content is democracy for a specific class, and dictatorship for its hostile classes. Bourgeois democracy is democracy, a paradise, for the bourgeoisie; but for the proletariat and the working people, it is dictatorship, it is hell. Bourgeois democracy is a systematic means of violent dictatorship used by the bourgeoisie to regulate its internal contradictions, unite its forces, and guarantee its freedom to exploit and oppress the proletariat and the working people. Socialist democracy or people's democracy is the opposite. It is democracy, a paradise, for the working class, the working people, and all those who support socialism; for the evil forces that oppose socialism, it is dictatorship, it is hell. Socialist democracy is the means by which the working class and the working people regulate their internal contradictions, unite their forces, guarantee their freedom from exploitation, suppress the resistance of the exploiters, and resist foreign aggression.

Democracy is not an end, but only a means

People who are superstitious and worship abstract "democracy and freedom" also have a prejudice, that is, they insist that democracy is the ultimate goal pursued by mankind, and do not recognize that democracy is a means. This view is also completely incorrect. Chairman Mao said: "Democracy, sometimes, seems to be an end, but in reality, it is only a means. Marxism tells us that democracy belongs to the superstructure, belongs to the category of politics. That is to say, in the final analysis, it serves the economic base."

Why does democracy "sometimes seem to be an end, but in reality, it is only a means"? For example, during the bourgeois democratic revolution, people put forward the slogan of "struggle for democracy," which seems like an end, doesn't it? But in fact, for all classes at that time, "struggle for democracy" was not the final, actual goal, but only the means to achieve this goal. Achieving democracy means overthrowing the autocratic rule of the feudal landlord class, which can be said to be a common goal of all anti-feudal classes, but in addition to this, each class has its own different ultimate goals. The purpose of the bourgeoisie is to replace the rule of the feudal landlord class with its own rule over the proletariat and the working people. The purpose of the proletariat's participation in and striving to lead the bourgeois democratic revolution is to temper its own strength in the democratic revolution, so that the bourgeois democratic revolution can be quickly transformed into a socialist revolution, in order to fundamentally eliminate classes and realize world communism.

Striving for socialist democracy or people's democracy of the proletarian dictatorship, this also seems like an end. But in fact, realizing socialist democracy or people's democracy, that is, realizing the rule of the proletariat and the majority of the working people, is not our ultimate goal. Our ultimate goal is to fundamentally eliminate classes and realize communism. By that time, the democratic system as a national power system, together with the Communist Party itself, will also be eliminated. By that time, there will still be a democratic centralism system for managing social public affairs, but there will be no democratic system with a certain target of dictatorship, that is, a democratic dictatorship system.

Bourgeois rightists clamor to "struggle for democracy, struggle for freedom," which seems to be their "purpose" of frenziedly opposing communism and opposing socialism. In fact, this is absolutely a deception. Their purpose is to overthrow the socialist system and re-establish the reactionary rule of the exploiting classes.

Does saying that democracy is a means belittle the significance of democracy? Absolutely not. The Communist Party has always attached great importance to the issue of the paths and methods of struggle to achieve revolutionary goals. These issues have always been an important part of the program of proletarian revolutionary struggle. Moreover, Marxism-Leninism has always believed that the issue of democracy and dictatorship, that is, the issue of political power, is the basic issue of all revolutions. The proletarian point of view is: during the socialist revolution, dictatorial means must be taken against all social forces that oppose socialism; democratic means must be taken for all forces that support socialism, for the people internally, that is, taking the mass line, relying on the consciousness and wisdom of the masses, learning from the masses, and using democratic methods to persuade and educate the masses. In short, in order to eliminate classes, in order to build socialism and communism, we must use the means of proletarian dictatorship or people's democratic dictatorship, and we must never use any other means. However, proletarian dictatorship or people's democratic dictatorship is ultimately not our goal. Our goal is to build socialism and communism.

The fundamental difference and fundamental opposition between socialist democracy and bourgeois democracy

Another issue that some people easily get confused about in the issue of democracy and freedom is what the fundamental difference between socialist democracy and bourgeois democracy is. Because they cannot see the difference and opposition between these two democratic systems, they have to swallow the sugar-coated poison pill of the bourgeois rightists' so-called "struggle for democracy" against the people's government.

In what main aspects are the fundamental differences and fundamental opposition between these two democratic systems manifested?

First, the difference lies in the fact that their purposes are completely different. As mentioned above, bourgeois democracy is used by the bourgeoisie to consolidate the bourgeoisie's exploitation and enslavement of the proletariat and the working people, to serve the economic base of the capitalist system. Therefore, it is the rule of a very small number of people over the vast majority of people in society, the "democracy" of a very small number of people in society. Socialist democracy is the complete opposite. It is used to eliminate the exploiting classes and guarantee the freedom of the proletariat and the working people from exploitation. It is used to eliminate the private ownership system of the means of production and consolidate the socialist public ownership system. It serves the economic base of the socialist system. Therefore, it is the rule of the vast majority of people in society over the very small number of exploiters who attempt to resist socialist transformation. It is the democracy of the vast majority of people in society, the true democracy, the democracy of the people.

Second, the difference lies in the fact that their forms of expression are completely different. First of all, although bourgeois democracy is clearly a dictatorship of a minority over the vast majority, in order to avoid being opposed by the majority, the bourgeoisie never dares to openly say this, but always hypocritically declares that its rule is "democracy for the whole people," and that the bourgeois rich men are "representatives of the whole people." It declares that everyone is "equal" before the law, and that as long as certain conditions are met, everyone has the right to vote and can also run for members of parliament, etc. But the problem lies in the fact that the bourgeois "democratic" constitutions and laws always use many restrictions to actually deprive the working masses of the right to participate in the management of state affairs. The material means necessary for conducting elections, such as newspapers, periodicals, radio stations, meeting places, etc., are all in the hands of the bourgeois rich men. Therefore, the usual actual situation is always like this, whether the working masses are willing or not, their freedom of election is nothing more than the "freedom" to choose a bunch of bastards from one bourgeois political party or another bunch of bastards from another bourgeois political party to serve as their own oppressors once every few years. It can be seen that the bourgeois democratic constitution is limited to hypocritically declaring formal democracy, formal equality, and freedom. This is in line with the narrow interests of the bourgeoisie, which can enable it to firmly consolidate the rule of the rich and powerful magnates.

In contrast, socialist democracy, because it is the democracy of the vast majority of people in society, dares to directly declare that it aims to guarantee the freedom of the majority of people in society from exploitation, and that it is the dictatorship of the vast majority over the very small number. For the people, it does not limit itself to declaring their equal rights and freedoms, but also emphasizes the political and material guarantee of the realization of such equal rights and freedoms.

Secondly, bourgeois democracy is the political reflection of the capitalist private ownership of the means of production, anarchic state and group competition, and the economy containing class antagonism. Therefore, the form of expression of bourgeois democracy is also the "democracy" in which "those who have money have power," the "democracy" in which various bourgeois groups freely compete with each other and are manipulated behind the scenes by banks and industrial giants, and it cannot but allow the proletariat and its political parties to politically struggle against the bourgeoisie to a certain extent, that is, within the scope that does not harm the fundamental interests of bourgeois rule. According to this form of democracy, whoever has money can start newspapers and participate in elections, and whoever can buy newspapers and buy votes. In this way, on the one hand, it can fully guarantee the bourgeois "democratic" deception and bloody rule over the proletariat and the working people, and on the other hand, it can regulate the internal struggles of the bourgeoisie.

However, socialist democracy is the political reflection of the socialist public ownership system, proportional development, and the economy that has eliminated or is eliminating class antagonism. Precisely because of this, the form of expression of socialist democracy is completely different from the form of expression of bourgeois democracy. Socialist democracy is the democratic centralism that is most conducive to the broad masses of people to participate in the management of state affairs, to directly decide the fate of the country, and is also most conducive to exercising dictatorship over the anti-socialist reactionary forces. The People's Congress is the full-power organ for exercising state power, and the state administrative organs, state judicial organs, state procuratorial organs, etc., are all responsible to the National People's Congress; at the same time, voters and electoral units can exercise the right of recall at any time for representatives of the People's Congresses at all levels, and the People's Congresses at all levels can exercise the right of recall at any time for responsible personnel of state organs at all levels. From the national to the local levels, there are People's Congresses, and these congresses elect and supervise administrative organs at all levels, and the people can exercise the right to criticize and supervise the staff of any state organ anytime and anywhere. This means that the socialist political system is one that carries the spirit of democracy to the end, and completely rejects the deep-rooted bureaucratic system of bourgeois "democratic" countries.

Third, the fundamental difference between socialist democracy and bourgeois democracy also lies in the fact that they are two different stages of development of democracy as a system of state power. If we examine it from a historical point of view, we can see that the bourgeois democratic system is an inevitable product of the development of capitalist large industry, and is a political superstructure created on the basis of the capitalist economy and serving this base. Compared with the autocratic system of the feudal landlord class, the bourgeois democratic system is undoubtedly a great progress. However, due to the inherent contradictions of the capitalist economy, that is, the contradiction between the social nature of production and the private ownership of capitalists, and the contradiction between the organized nature of production in capitalist enterprises and the anarchic state of the entire social production, and the antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the bourgeois democratic system also reflects all these contradictions, and contains the narrowness of its class content and the ugly, incomplete defects and hypocrisy of its forms of expression. In maintaining the freedom of exploitation of the exploiting minority while oppressing the exploited majority, bourgeois democracy is essentially the same as the autocracy of the feudal landlord class.

In the history of the world, only the socialist democracy of the proletarian dictatorship has broken the limitations of democracy under bourgeois rule, broken the narrowness of its class content and the ugly, incomplete defects and hypocrisy of its forms of expression. Just as the socialist economic system is a great progress in the development of human society compared to the capitalist economic system, the socialist democratic system is also a great progress in the development of human social history compared to the bourgeois democratic system.

It can be seen that what the bourgeois rightists say is that capitalist countries are more democratic than socialist countries. From the point of view of the working people, from the point of view of true democracy, this is nothing more than the most despicable and ridiculous self-deception. In fact, we see that: bourgeois democracy is a hypocritical, ugly, narrow, and incomplete democracy. Only the socialist democracy of the proletarian dictatorship established by overthrowing bourgeois democracy, that is, bourgeois dictatorship, is a democracy worthy of the name, a sound and complete democracy. This kind of democracy, with the increasingly complete revolutionary transformation of socialism and the increasingly development of socialist construction, is becoming more and more sound and expanded, and is increasingly developing from the democracy of the vast majority of the working people to the true democracy of the whole people, that is, the democracy of all members of society. This irrefutably proves that the development from bourgeois democracy to socialist democracy is a fundamental change in the nature of democracy as a system of state power, and is an infinite expansion and development of democracy. At the same time, the more democracy becomes democracy of the whole people, the more democracy as a system of state power, together with state power itself, will gradually move towards extinction.

    论民主自由
    廖盖隆
    资产阶级右派向共产党和社会主义事业猖狂进攻的最主要的政治口号之一，就是所谓“争民主，争自由”。他们都诬称我们社会主义国家没有民主和自由，只有西方资产阶级国家才有民主和自由。右派分子在“民主”“自由”的名义下进行的煽动，在政治界（各民主党派）、知识界和工商界等方面，得到了一些具有资产阶级反人民的抽象民主思想或小资产阶级的反动的无政府主义思想的人们的附和。这样，就造成了一阵反共的和无政府主义的狂热。
    现在，当反对资产阶级右派的说理斗争展开之后，即使是一时附和了右派分子的反社会主义活动的那些人，也开始认识到右派分子所谓争取“民主自由”在政治上的欺骗性了。他们哪里是争取什么人民的民主自由，完全相反，他们是要根本消灭人民的民主自由，根本改变我们国家的政治制度，从而重新建立起反动的剥削阶级对于全国人民的血腥奴役统治。
    但是，在政治上认识资产阶级右派分子的反对人民的民主自由的丑恶立场，是一回事；在思想上彻底认识他们的抽象的“民主自由”宣传的欺骗性和反动性，又是一回事。在这方面，有许多人还有这种那种问题没有完全弄清楚，这就需要我们对这些问题作一番讨论。
    民主和自由都是有具体的阶级内容的
    资产阶级长时期以来所进行的欺骗宣传，在许多人中间、特别是许多知识分子中间，造成了一种把“民主自由”加以神化、抽象化、绝对化的观念。他们所想像的民主自由，是绝对好的东西，是没有一定的阶级内容的东西。同这些人不同，资产阶级右派分子是充分了解他们所要求的“民主自由”的阶级内容的，因此，他们有意识地利用人们头脑中迷信抽象的“民主自由”的成见，来施展他们的反社会主义的卑鄙阴谋。
    世界上根本没有存在过抽象的、对所有阶级都一视同仁的民主和自由，而只有具体的，即具有特定的阶级内容的民主和自由。历史上有过代替封建地主阶级的专制统治而兴起的资产阶级民主，有过代替资产阶级的民主统治而兴起的无产阶级民主即社会主义民主。至于没有具体的阶级内容的一般“民主”，却是不曾有过的，而且也不可能有。
    民主是什么？民主是一种国家政治制度，是特定的阶级用来调整自己内部的矛盾、团结自己的力量，以便对自己的敌对的阶级施行有系统的暴力专政的手段。作为一种国家政治制度的民主，同时也就是专政，或者更确切地说，有特定阶级内容的民主，对于特定的阶级是民主，而对于它的敌对的阶级就是专政。资产阶级民主对于资产阶级是民主，是天堂；而对于无产阶级和劳动人民，就是专政，就是地狱。资产阶级民主，是资产阶级用来调节自己的内部矛盾、团结自己的力量、保障它自己剥削和压迫无产阶级和劳动人民的自由的有系统的暴力专政手段。社会主义民主或人民民主则刚好相反。它对于工人阶级、劳动人民和一切拥护社会主义的人们，是民主，是天堂；对于反对社会主义的恶势力，就是专政，就是地狱。社会主义民主是工人阶级和劳动人民用来调节自己的内部矛盾、团结自己的力量、保障自己不受剥削的自由、镇压剥削者的反抗和抵御外来侵略的手段。
    民主不是目的，只是手段
    迷信和崇拜抽象的“民主自由”的人们，还有一种偏见，就是他们硬说民主是人类所追求的终极目的，而不承认民主是手段。这种意见也是完全不正确的。毛主席说：“民主这个东西，有时看来似乎是目的，实际上，只是一种手段。马克思主义告诉我们，民主属于上层建筑，属于政治这个范畴。这就是说，归根结底，它是为经济基础服务的。”
    为什么民主“有时看来似乎是目的，实际上，只是一种手段”呢？例如，在资产阶级民主革命时期，人们提出了“争取民主”的口号，这看来岂不好像是目的吗？但其实，当时对于各个阶级来说，“争取民主”并不是最后的、实际上的目的，而只是达到这个目的的手段。实现民主意味着推翻封建地主阶级的专制统治，这一点可以说是各个反封建阶级的一个共同的目的，但除此以外，各个阶级还有各自不同的最终目的。资产阶级的目的是用自己对无产阶级和劳动人民的统治，去代替封建地主阶级的统治。无产阶级参加和力求领导资产阶级民主革命的目的，则是为了在民主革命中锻炼自己的力量，使资产阶级民主革命迅速转变为社会主义革命，以便根本消灭阶级和实现世界大同。
    争取无产阶级专政的社会主义民主或人民民主，这看起来也好像是目的。但是实际上，实现社会主义民主或人民民主，即实现无产阶级和劳动人民大多数的统治，这也不是我们的终极目的，我们的终极目的是根本消灭阶级，实现共产主义。到了那时，作为国家权力制度的民主制度，连同共产党本身，也是要消灭的。到了那时，还会有管理社会公共事务的民主集中制度，但是有一定专政对象的民主制度，即民主专政制度，却没有了。
    资产阶级右派叫嚷着要“争民主，争自由”，这也好像是他们猖狂地反共反社会主义的“目的”。实际上，这绝对是欺骗。他们的目的是推翻社会主义制度，而重新建立剥削阶级的反动统治。
    说民主是手段，这是不是贬低了民主的意义呢？决不是如此。共产党对于达到革命目标的斗争途径和方法问题，从来是十分重视的。这些问题从来就是无产阶级革命斗争纲领的一个重要内容。而且，马克思列宁主义从来就认为，关于民主和专政的问题，也就是政权问题，乃是一切革命的基本问题。无产阶级的观点是：在社会主义革命时期，对于一切反对社会主义的社会力量必须采取专政的手段；对于一切拥护社会主义的力量，对于人民内部，必须采取民主的手段，即走群众路线、依靠群众的觉悟和智慧、向群众学习而又用民主的方法向群众进行说服教育的手段。总之，为了消灭阶级，为了建成社会主义和共产主义，必须运用无产阶级专政或人民民主专政的手段，而决不能运用任何别的手段。但是，无产阶级专政或人民民主专政这终究不是我们的目的，我们的目的是建成社会主义和共产主义。
    社会主义民主和资产阶级民主的根本区别和根本对立
    在民主自由的问题上，有些人容易搞胡涂的又一个问题，就是社会主义民主和资产阶级民主究竟有什么根本区别的问题。由于看不到这两种民主的区别和对立，他们就不得不吞下了资产阶级右派分子所谓向人民政府“争民主”这样一个包着糖衣的毒药丸。
    这两种民主制度的根本区别和根本对立，主要表现在那些方面呢？
    第一，在于它们的目的完全不同。如上所述，资产阶级民主是资产阶级用来巩固资产阶级对于无产阶级和劳动人民的剥削和奴役，是为资本主义制度这个经济基础服务的，因此，它是社会上极少数人对于极大多数人的统治，是社会上极少数人的“民主”。社会主义民主则完全相反，它是用来消灭剥削阶级和保障无产阶级和劳动人民不受剥削的自由的，是用来消灭生产资料的私有制度和巩固社会主义公有制度的，是为社会主义制度这个经济基础服务的，因此，它是社会上极大多数人对于极少数企图反抗社会主义改造的剥削者的统治，是社会上极大多数人的民主，是真正的民主、人民的民主。
    第二，在于它们的表现形式完全不同。首先，资产阶级民主虽然明明是少数人对绝大多数人的专政，但是资产阶级为了避免遭到大多数人的反对起见，却从来不敢公开说出这一点，而总是虚伪地宣布它的统治是“全民的民主”，而资产阶级富豪老爷们就是“全民的代表”。它宣布每个人在法律面前都是“平等”的，只要具备一定的条件，每个人都有选举权，也可以竞选为国会议员等等。但是问题正是在于，资产阶级的“民主”的宪法和法律，总是要用许多限制，实际上取消劳动群众参加国家事务的管理的权利。报纸、刊物、广播电台、集会场所等等为进行竞选所必需的物质手段，都掌握在资产阶级富豪们的手中。因此通常实际情况总是这样，不管劳动群众愿意与否，他们的选举自由不过是几年一次地选择这一个资产阶级政党的一批混蛋，或者另一个资产阶级政党的另外一批混蛋来充当他们自己的压迫者的“自由”罢了。由此可见，资产阶级的民主宪法只限于虚伪地宣布形式上的民主、形式上的平等和自由，这是符合资产阶级的狭隘利益的，这就可以使它稳有把握地巩固有钱有势的大富豪的统治。
    相反地，社会主义民主由于是社会上极大多数人的民主，它就敢于直接宣布它是以保障社会上大多数人不受剥削的自由为目的的，它是极大多数人对极少数人的专政。对于人民，它不以宣布他们的平等权利和自由为限，而且进而着重地从政治上和物质上保障这种平等权利和自由的实现。
    其次，资产阶级的民主，是资本主义的私人占有生产资料的、无政府状态和集团竞争的、包含着阶级对抗的经济在政治上的反映。因此，资产阶级民主的表现形态，也就是“有钱的人就有势”的“民主”，是资产阶级各个集团之间互相进行自由竞争而由银行和工业巨头从幕后加以操纵的“民主”，而且它也不能不在一定范围内、即在不致损害资产阶级统治的根本利益的范围内允许无产阶级及其政党在政治上对资产阶级进行斗争。按照这种表现形态的民主，谁有钱，谁就可以创办报刊、参加竞选，谁就可以收买报刊和收买选票。这样，一方面既可以充分保证资产阶级对于无产阶级和劳动人民的“民主”的愚弄和血腥的统治，另一方面又可以调节资产阶级内部的斗争。
    但是，社会主义民主却是社会主义公有制的、按比例发展的、已经消灭了或者正在消灭阶级对抗的经济在政治上的反映。正因为这样，社会主义民主的表现形态，也就和资产阶级民主的表现形态完全不同。社会主义民主是最便于广大人民群众来参加国家事务的管理、来直接决定国家的命运，而又最便于对反社会主义的反动势力实行专政的民主集中制。人民代表大会是行使国家权力的全权机关，国家行政机关、国家司法机关、国家检察机关等，都是对全国人民代表大会负责的；同时，选民和选举单位对于各级人民代表大会的代表，各级人民代表大会对于各级国家机关负责工作人员，都可以随时行使罢免权。从全国到各级地方，都有人民代表大会，并且这些代表大会都选举和监督各级行政机关，人民群众随时随地都可以行使批评和监督任何国家机关工作人员的权利。这就是说，社会主义的政治制度是把民主精神贯彻到底的，是彻底排斥资产阶级“民主”国家的那种根深蒂固的官僚制度的。
    第三，社会主义民主和资产阶级民主的根本区别还在于：它们是作为国家权力制度的民主的两个性质不同的发展阶段。如果从历史上来考察，那就可以看到，资产阶级民主制度是资本主义大工业发展的必然产物，是在资本主义经济基础上创立起来，并且为这个基础服务的政治上层建筑。和封建地主阶级的专制制度比较起来，资产阶级民主制度无疑是一个巨大的进步。但是，由于资本主义经济内在的矛盾，即生产的社会性和资本家的私人占有的矛盾，以及由此产生的资本主义企业生产的有组织性和整个社会生产的无政府状态的矛盾，和无产阶级同资产阶级之间的对抗性矛盾，资产阶级民主制度也就反映了这一切的矛盾，包含了它的阶级内容的狭隘性和表现形式上的丑陋、残缺不全的毛病和虚伪性。在维护剥削者少数人的剥削自由而压迫被剥削者大多数人这一点上，资产阶级民主和封建地主阶级的专制，实质上是完全一样的。
    在世界的历史上，只有无产阶级专政的社会主义民主，才打破了资产阶级统治下民主的局限性，才打破了它的阶级内容的狭隘性和表现形式上的丑陋、残缺不全的毛病和虚伪性。正如社会主义经济制度对于资本主义经济制度是人类社会发展的极大进步一样，社会主义民主制度对于资产阶级民主制度也是人类社会历史发展的极大进步。
    由此可见，资产阶级右派分子说什么资本主义国家比社会主义国家更民主，从劳动人民的观点看来，从真正民主的观点看来，这不过是最可鄙、最可笑的自欺欺人之谈吧了。实际上我们却看到：资产阶级民主，是虚伪的、丑陋的、狭隘的、残缺不全的民主。只有推翻了资产阶级民主即资产阶级专政而建立起来的无产阶级专政的社会主义民主，才是名副其实的、健全的和形态完备的民主。这种民主，随着社会主义的革命改造的日益完成和社会主义建设的日益发展，而日益健全和扩大，日益由劳动人民极大多数的民主发展成为真正全民的民主，即社会全体成员的民主。这就无可辩驳地证明了，由资产阶级民主到社会主义民主的发展，是作为国家权力制度的民主所经历的一种根本性质的变化，是民主的无限扩大和发展。同时，民主愈是成为全民的民主，作为国家权力制度的民主，连同国家权力本身也就日益走向消亡。
