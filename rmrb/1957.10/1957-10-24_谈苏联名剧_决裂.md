On the Soviet Famous Play "Rupture"
冬今

I think it is a very meaningful thing that the Shanghai Theatre Academy's Performance Instructor Refresher Course performed the Soviet famous play "Rupture" in its graduation performance. First, this play is about the story of the sharp struggle between revolution and counter-revolution before the cruiser "Aurora" shelled the Winter Palace, which is of great reference value to our current anti-rightist struggle; second, this play was personally rehearsed by Soviet drama expert, Comrade Ye. Kang. Liepkovskaya, who has had 20 years of actor life and 20 years of teacher life; third, this play is performed on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, how can we not express our welcome? We not only hope that this play will be performed in Beijing, but also hope that it will be performed elsewhere.

Anyone who has been to Leningrad will ask to visit the cruiser "Aurora" moored on the Neva River, and the sailors on the ship will tell you the heroic story of the ship's struggle in the October Revolution.

But how many people can go to Leningrad? Thanks to the playwright Lavrenyov, he brought this heroic struggle story to the stage, so that people all over the world can see this story and learn from it.

The story immediately attracts the audience at the beginning - that is, the opening of the first act of the play. It is really a huge conflict and contradiction, a couple, Daria and her husband Stube's quarrel, if the instructions have not already told the audience, the audience will definitely think that it is a quarrel because of housework, in fact, it already contains the quarrel of revolutionary and counter-revolutionary positions, the quarrel for workers and peasants or for the Tsarist system, this quarrel is by no means only expressed in some political principles of dialogue, but unfolded from the characters of the two characters. Therefore, it deeply attracts the audience.

The contradiction and conflict are further unfolded. The daughter's father, Colonel Biershev, is the captain of the ship, a person who completely sympathizes with the sailors' uprising and has already stood on the side of the sailors. His son-in-law, Lieutenant Stube, is exactly the opponent on the warship.

The contradiction and conflict are further unfolded. The sailor Gordon, the chairman of the ship committee, in order to understand more languages to carry out the revolution, he is asking Daria to tutor him in English, which makes her husband - Stube not only fundamentally hates her from the revolution, but also suspects that she is in love with Gordon.

In short, this counter-revolutionary has already felt that he is in a completely isolated position at this time. He once wanted to leave Russia, go to Finland to live an exiled life, and force Daria to leave with him, and also ask Daria's father to persuade her to go. This was all rejected. Daria not only still teaches Gordon English, but also participates in rescue work.

At this time, on the warship, on the one hand, the Socialist Revolutionaries colluded with the naval generals, trying to disintegrate the revolution and destroy the unity of the sailors, on the other hand, there were some sailors who thought that the revolution had taken place, so they could not talk about discipline and were destroying the discipline on the ship, and on the other hand, there was the traitor on the ship - the boatswain was carrying out sabotage under the instructions of Lieutenant Stube. Here, the huge conflict and contradiction, unfolded from the family, from the couple to the political stage of the whole Russia. The audience can see that the battle on this warship, as well as the battle around it, is by no means a few people on the drama stage. The audience can all get an education from here: in this critical struggle, where should we stand? Revolution and counter-revolution are really only a hair's breadth away!

Gordon, this heroic warrior of the proletariat, a resourceful Bolshevik, he resolutely carries out the orders of his superiors, and he resolutely relies on the masses, but at the same time he opposes the behavior of the masses in destroying discipline; and for the captain, Colonel Biershev, he is so accurate, knowing that he is resolutely following the revolution, although he still retains some of the self-esteem of the old army, so Gordon both protects him and advises him, and when he is finally framed by the counter-revolutionaries, when the masses want to sanction him, Gordon still stands up to protect him, so in the end he unites him. Through these fighting scenes, the image of Gordon is more prominent.

But the more Gordon stands up, the more the counter-revolutionaries refuse to give in. They use the legal status of the colonel's residence (because the colonel participated in the revolution) to hold counter-revolutionary meetings and conspire here to blow up the cruiser to prevent it from going to Leningrad. This is really at a critical moment, who discovered this evil conspiracy? Of course, we should thank the playwright's clever and reasonable arrangement - through Daria's sister Ksenia's naive words, wanting to borrow the colonel's telescope to watch the warship explode, it was discovered by Daria. At this time, Daria had completely broken off the so-called husband and wife relationship, resolutely broke with the counter-revolutionaries, reported to the Party organs and took a speedboat to the warship to report, so that the counter-revolutionary Stube and the boatswain were caught, and also saved her father - Colonel Biershev, who was suspected of being killed by the sentry on the ship - from the dangerous situation of almost losing his life. Thus, the character of Daria was also shown brightly, giving intellectuals a model to learn from.

Finally, the "Aurora" was able to safely drive to Leningrad and carry out its task of shelling the Winter Palace. As Gordon said: "We must resolutely and unhesitatingly break with the bourgeoisie, we must completely smash the shackles of the bourgeoisie. We must fight as if we have never fought before. No one of us will step back until we win."

This can be said to be the basic idea of ​​this script. What is valuable is that it tells the audience in a very vivid, very tense, and very reasonable description, thus deeply infecting the audience. Therefore, even though some dialogues are very lengthy, the audience can still listen and watch quietly.

The whole performance is compact, the characterization is also profound, very revolutionary, and quite rich in the mood of warships and the sea. The only shortcoming is that the actors are not so neat, which affects the image of some of the characters. This may be because it is a refresher course for teachers, and the students - actors - come from all over the country, which is completely forgivable, and it is believed that it will gradually mature.

Finally, I would also like to thank the Soviet expert Comrade Liepkovskaya and the comrades of the Shanghai Theatre Academy, because it is with their hard work that our Beijing audience has this opportunity to appreciate - no, it should be said to learn.

    谈苏联名剧“决裂”
    冬今
    上海戏剧学院表演师资进修班结业公演苏联名剧“决裂”，我认为是一件很有意义的事情。第一，这个戏写的是巡洋舰“阿芙乐尔”号炮击冬宫前革命与反革命尖锐斗争的故事，对我们目前反右派斗争很有参考价值；第二，这个戏是苏联戏剧专家，有过二十年演员生活、二十年教师生活、进修班的教师叶·康·列普柯芙斯卡雅同志亲自排练的；第三，这个戏公演在十月革命四十周年即将到来之际，我们怎能不表示欢迎呢？我们不仅希望这个戏在北京演，而且希望在别的地方也演。
    凡是到过列宁格勒的人，都会要求去参观这艘停在?瓦河上的“阿芙乐尔”号巡洋舰，舰上的水兵都会告诉你这艘军舰在十月革命时斗争的英雄故事。
    但是，到底有多少人能够到列宁格勒呢？感谢剧作者拉夫列尼科夫，他把这个英勇斗争的故事搬上舞台，使全世界的人都能够看到这个故事，并从这个故事中学习。
    故事一开头——即戏的第一幕一开场，就把观众吸引住了。真是巨大的冲突和矛盾，一对夫妻，达吉雅娜和她的丈夫什图别的争吵，如果不是说明书早已告诉观众，观众一定以为是因家务事而争吵，其实这中间早已蕴藏着革命与反革命立场的争吵，为工农还是为沙皇制度的争吵，这个争吵决不是只表现在一些政治原则的对话上，而是从两个人物的性格上展开的。因此，它深深的吸引住了观众。
    矛盾、冲突进一步展开，女儿的爸爸——别尔谢?夫上校，正是这个舰的舰长，一个完全同情水兵起义并已经站在水兵这一边的人，和他的女婿什图别上尉恰是针锋相对的在军舰上的对手。
    矛盾、冲突更进一步展开，水兵戈东，舰艇委员会的主席，为了使自己懂得更多的语言去进行革命，他正在请达吉雅娜补习英文，这更使得她的丈夫——什图别不仅从革命上根本仇视她，而且还怀疑她在和戈东恋爱。
    总之，这个反革命到这时已经感到自己是处于完全孤立的地位了。他曾经想离开俄国，到芬兰去过流亡生活，并逼着达吉雅娜和他一起离开，还要达吉雅娜的爸爸说服她也走。这，全都被拒绝了。达吉雅娜不仅仍教戈东的英文，而且参加了救护工作。
    这时在军舰上，一方面是社会革命党人同海军将领勾结，企图来瓦解革命，破坏水兵的团结，一面还有一些以为革命了，就可以不讲纪律的水兵在破坏舰上的纪律，再一面就是舰上的内奸——水手长在什图别上尉的指示下进行破坏。这里，巨大的冲突，矛盾，由家庭，由夫妻而展开到了全俄国的政治舞台上。观众就可以看到这艘军舰上的战斗，以及围绕它的战斗决不是戏剧舞台上的几个人。观众都可以从这里得到教育：在这千钧一发的斗争中，到底应该站在那里呢？革命，反革命真是只有一发之隔呀！
    戈东，这个无产阶级的英勇战士，有勇有谋的布尔什维克，他坚决执行着上级的命令，他又坚决的依靠群众，但他又同时反对群众破坏纪律的行为；而对于舰长别尔谢?夫上校，他又是那样的看得准，知道他是坚决跟革命走的，虽然他还保留着一些旧军的自尊，所以戈东既保护他，又规劝他，到他最后被反革命陷害时，群众要制裁他，戈东还是挺身出来保护他，因而最后还是团结了他。通过这些斗争场面，戈东这个人物的形象更加突出了。
    但是戈东越站起来，反革命越不让步，他们利用了上校的住宅（因为上校参加了革命）的合法地位，开起反革命的会来，并在这里密谋炸毁巡洋舰，阻止它开到列宁格勒。这真是到了千钧一发之际，谁发现了这个罪恶的阴谋呢？当然应该感谢剧作家的巧妙而合情的安排——通过达吉雅娜的妹妹克谢尼雅天真的说话，要借上校的望远镜去看军舰爆炸而为达吉雅娜发觉了，这时达吉雅娜已完全打断所谓夫妻之情，坚决的和反革命分子决裂，到党的机关报告并乘坐快艇到军舰上去报告，使反革命分子什图别和水手长落网，也使她的爸爸——别尔谢?夫上校因舰上哨兵的被暗害而遭到的怀疑——险些送了命的危境得以解救。从而也使达吉雅娜这个人物显出了光耀，给知识分子一个学习的榜样。
    最后“阿芙乐尔”号得以安全地开得列宁格勒，执行它炮击冬宫的任务。正如戈东所说：“我们要坚决地、毫不犹疑地和资产阶级决裂，我们要把资产阶级的枷锁彻底粉碎。我们要像从来没有过的那样去战斗。在取得胜利以前，我们任何人也不倒退一步”。
    这可以说是这个剧本的基本思想，可贵的是它是用十分形象，十分紧张，而又十分合情合理的描写来告诉观众，从而深深地感染了观众。因而尽管有些对话很冗长，观众还是能静静地听下去，看下去。
    整个演出是紧凑的，人物的刻划也是深刻的，很有革命的气魄，也颇富有军舰上和海上的情调。唯嫌不足的是演员不那样太整齐，多少影响一些剧中人的形象。这可能因为是师资进修班，各地来的学生——演员的关系，这是完全可以原谅的，而且相信一定会逐渐成熟的。
    最后，还要感谢苏联专家列普柯芙斯卡雅同志，感谢上海戏剧学院的同志们，因为有了他们的辛勤劳动，才使我们北京观众有这个欣赏——不，应该说是学习的机会。
