Revision of the Poem "Qiantang River Bridge"

    The second section of the poem "Qiantang River Bridge" written by President Guo Moruo (see page 8 of this newspaper on the 6th of this month) mentioned that there was a tunnel under the bridge. This was a mistake by the author. Now the author has sent a letter to revise the second section as follows:

    Suddenly the whole bridge quivered and vibrated,
    It turns out there is a railway laid under the bridge.
    A southbound train is passing on the railway,
    This adds to the dramatic subtlety.

### 对“钱塘江大桥”一诗的修正

    对“钱塘江大桥”一诗的修正
    郭沫若院长所作“钱塘江大桥”一诗（见本月6日本报八版）第二节提到大桥之下还有隧道，这是作者写错了，现在作者来信将第二节作如下修改：
    忽然间全桥隐隐地震跃，
    原来还有下桥敷设着铁道。
    铁道上正通过南下的火车，
    这就增加了戏剧性的微妙。
