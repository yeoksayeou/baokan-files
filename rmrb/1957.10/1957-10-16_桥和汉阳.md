Bridge and Hanyang
By Zhang Wei, Our Correspondent

    Hanyang is a famous city with a long history. Sixty years ago, after the establishment of the Hanyang Iron Works and the Hanyang Arsenal here, it became one of China's earliest industrial bases. However, when we visited this famous city in the early days of liberation, we were disappointed. The largest street here, West Street, was a narrow and uneven bluestone road, and two people could block the traffic by stretching out their arms. The whole area was full of dilapidated, low, black-tiled houses and thatched sheds. Apart from the three factories, every household used green oil lamps and kerosene lamps, and most residents drank pond water. The famous Hanyang Iron Works and Arsenal were now only ruins.

    The Yangtze and Han Rivers restricted the development of Hanyang. For many years, the people of Hanyang had been eagerly hoping to build a bridge.

    Before 1953, the People's Government had spent a great deal of effort to build Hanyang, and had successively built the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Factory, the Sleeper Preservation Factory, and the Central South Timber Factory and other industrial enterprises here. However, the constraints of the Yangtze and Han Rivers meant that the raw materials and finished products of these factories had to be transshipped by wooden boats, which increased costs. The people of Hanyang, who were closely connected with Hankou and Wuchang, still had to risk crossing the river in small boats from time to time.

    In 1954 and 1955, the Han River Railway Bridge and the Han River Highway Bridge, which were part of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, were completed successively. Since then, the railway has extended into the Sleeper Preservation Factory, and the processing cost of each sleeper has been reduced from 2.69 yuan to 1.49 yuan. The road goes directly to Hankou. More than a thousand buildings have been built on the original chaotic cemetery. Seventeen miles of tap water pipes cover the urban area. The widespread installation of electric lights and public telephones has made the people of Hanyang more aware of the world around them. The stinky pond in front of Qixian Temple and the dilapidated Qin Terrace have been transformed into Hanyang Park and Cultural Palace. The appearance of Hanyang has been completely changed!

    At the end of 1955, when trucks loaded with grain and construction materials and large buses first drove from Hankou to Hanyang via the highway bridge, tens of thousands of Hanyang people gathered at the bridgehead to cheer, beat waist drums, and perform Yangko dances to celebrate the great victory of the motherland's construction cause and the realization of their long-cherished ideals. An old woman, Wu, also took out the clothes she had been saving at the bottom of the box for many years and put them on, and went to the bridgehead to sightsee. In the evening, she personally sent her granddaughter to a school in Hankou to attend a New Year's Eve party. She also said to her granddaughter: "Your father took a small boat to Hankou and died when the boat capsized in a storm. The Communist Party led the people to build the bridge, now it's great!" Some people even took the bus between Hanyang and Hankou, making several round trips without getting off.

    Now, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has been completed and opened to traffic. This will further make Hanyang an important north-south transportation hub in China. Hanyang's industry will also become more prosperous.

### 桥和汉阳

　　桥和汉阳
　　本报记者　张碨
    汉阳是座历史悠久的名城。六十年前，这里修建起汉阳铁厂和汉阳兵工厂以后，更成了我国最早的工业基地之一。但是，当我们在解放初期到这座名城游览的时候，却很失望。这里最大的街道——西大街是狭窄不平的青石路，两人伸开手臂就可以拦断交通。全区到处都是破旧低矮的黑瓦房和茅棚。这里除了三家工厂以外，家家点的都是青油灯和煤油灯，多数居民都是吃湖塘积水。著名的汉阳铁厂和兵工厂这时也只剩下一片废墟。
    这是长江、汉水限制了汉阳的发展。多少年来，汉阳人民都迫切希望修建大桥。
    1953年以前，人民政府曾经花了很大的力量来建设汉阳，先后在这里建起了国棉一厂、枕木防腐厂和中南制材厂等工业企业。但是，长江和汉水的箝制，使这些工厂的原料、成品都必须用木船转载，增高了成本。同汉口、武昌有着千丝万缕的联系的汉阳人民，也还必须时常冒坐小划子过江的风险。
    1954年和1955年，武汉长江大桥的组成部分——汉水铁路桥和汉水公路桥先后建成了。从此，铁路伸进了枕木防腐厂，每根枕木的加工成本由2.69元降低到1.49元。马路直通汉口。在原来的乱坟岗盖起了一千多栋楼房。十七里长的自来水管遍布市区。普遍设置的电灯和公用电话，使汉阳人民的耳目灵光了。栖贤寺前面的臭水塘和破旧的琴台建成了汉阳公园和文化宫。汉阳的面貌彻底的改变了！
    1955年年底，当满载粮食、建筑器材的卡车和大型公共汽车，首次由汉口经过公路桥驶到汉阳的时候，成千上万的汉阳人民都拥集在桥头欢呼，还打腰鼓，扭秧歌，庆祝祖国建设事业的重大胜利和自己多年理想的实现。一位吴老太太这天也把压在箱底多年的合心的衣裙翻出来穿上，走上桥头观光。晚上，她又亲自送她孙女儿到汉口的学校去开除夕晚会。她还对孙女说：“你父亲是坐划子去汉口，遇上风浪翻船死的。共产党领导人民修了桥，现在可好了！”有的人还坐上汉阳和汉口之间的公共汽车，往返几趟都不下车。
    现在，武汉长江大桥已经落成通车了。这将进一步使汉阳成为我国南北交通要道。汉阳的工业也将更加繁荣起来。
