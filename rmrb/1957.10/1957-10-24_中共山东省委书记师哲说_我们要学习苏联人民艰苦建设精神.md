    Shizhe, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, who had fought alongside the Soviet people for many years, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that learning from the Soviet people's revolutionary spirit of hard work in building socialism, constructing our motherland, and defending world peace is the best practical action for the Chinese people to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution.

    Shizhe said that after the success of the October Revolution, excluding the war and recovery periods, which totaled about fifteen years, the Soviet people had only about twenty-five years to truly devote themselves to construction. In these twenty-five years, the Soviet people built the Soviet Union into an industrially advanced, agriculturally strong, and technologically first-class country, which is unimaginable in any capitalist country.

    Shizhe said that the Soviet people fought tenaciously with a spirit of hard work and diligence. During the first five-year plan, the administrative expenses, staffing, and wages of various departments in the Soviet Union were relatively fixed, and the system was very strict; not a single penny was allowed to be wasted; however, the funds and materials needed by production and construction units were guaranteed to be supplied. In order to build a strong industrial base, the Soviet people had to slow down the development of light industry, so the supply of daily necessities was also greatly limited. Especially during the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, it was even more difficult. As we are vigorously building our motherland, we must first learn from the Soviet people's revolutionary spirit of hard work in building socialism, work hard to produce, and increase wealth for the country. Only when the country is prosperous and strong can the improvement of everyone's life be fundamentally guaranteed.

    Next, Shizhe cited several major problems faced by the Soviet people in construction and analyzed them in light of China's specific conditions.

    He said that when the Soviet Union was about to embark on large-scale construction, the first problem it encountered was whether to take the socialist road. This issue was clarified in the Soviet Party after a long struggle between 1925 and 1927. This was actually a decisive battle in politics and ideology. Shizhe said that the current anti-Rightist struggle we are conducting in China is also a major issue of right and wrong on two lines. We fully believe that socialism will surely win, and capitalism can never be restored in China. At the same time, we must also carry out socialist propaganda campaigns extensively in cities, factories, enterprises, and rural areas to let the broad masses of working people clearly know the road and goals ahead, and know that it is the Party that is leading them to advance towards socialism.

    Shizhe said that secondly, there was also a debate in the Soviet Union about who to rely on to build socialism. The Soviet Party refuted all nonsense and determined the policy of relying on the country, relying on the laboring masses, and striving for foreign aid. "Self-reliance and striving for foreign aid" is also our country's construction policy. We Chinese people must learn from the Soviet people's tenacious struggle, persevere, and the working spirit and revolutionary will of not stopping until the goal is achieved.

    Third, how to build? The Soviet Union determined the policy of comprehensive development of industry and agriculture, with priority given to the development of heavy industry. The correctness of this policy was tested victoriously in the following years, especially in the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union. Our country is also implementing the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, while giving priority to the development of heavy industry; although some ulterior motives have criticized our country's policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, this policy is unshakable.

    Fourth, the issue of establishing and developing our own intellectual ranks. The Soviet Communist Party spent a lot of effort in this regard. At that time, a large number of worker-peasant cadres and children of the laboring people were transferred to schools for training or sent abroad to study. At the same time, a large number of young students, including children of cadres, were sent to factories or farms to participate in labor and help with work, and then continued to study or enlist in the army after a few years. Shizhe said that the practical knowledge learned in factories and rural areas is much more valuable than the knowledge gained sitting on school benches. This proves the correctness and necessity of our Party Central Committee's advocacy that cadres at all levels, especially intellectuals, participate in labor.

    Shizhe said that the great achievements that the Soviet people have made in the past forty years can be summarized by the two words diligence and thrift, in addition to the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and the correct policies and leadership of the Communist Party. We Chinese people must be diligent and thrifty to build our country, which has a large population, little arable land, and a weak foundation, into a prosperous and strong country.

    中共山东省委书记师哲说
    我们要学习苏联人民艰苦建设精神
    本报讯　曾和苏联人民一道奋斗过多年的中共山东省委员会书记处书记师哲向新华社记者说，学习苏联人民艰苦建设社会主义的革命精神，建设我们的祖国，保卫世界和平，是中国人民庆祝伟大十月革命四十周年最好的实际行动。
    师哲说，十月革命成功以后，除去战争和恢复时期前后共约十五年外，四十年中苏联人民真正能够专心致力于建设的时间不过二十五年。在这二十五年中，苏联人民把苏联建成为工业上先进的、农业上强大的、科学技术上头等的国家，这是世界上任何一个资本主义国家不可想像的。
    师哲说，苏联人民本着刻苦、勤劳的革命精神顽强奋斗。在第一个五年计划期间，苏联各部门行政办公费、人员编制、工资等都相当固定，制度非常严格，一个钱也不允许乱花；但是生产建设单位所需的经费和物资都保证供应。苏联人民为了建设自己强大的工业基础，在轻工业的发展上不得不放慢一步，所以在日常用品的供应上也受到了很大的限制。特别在苏联伟大卫国战争时期，更是艰苦。我们正以大力建设祖国的时候，首先必须学习苏联人民艰苦建设社会主义的革命精神，努力生产，多为国家增加财富。只有国家富强了，每个人的生活改善才能得到根本的保证。
    接着，师哲举出苏联人民在建设中曾面临的几个重大问题，并且结合我国具体情况进行了分析。
    他说，当苏联正要展开大规模建设的时候，首先遇到的问题是走不走社会主义道路的问题。这个问题在1925—1927年间，在苏联党内经过长期斗争才澄清。这实际是政治上和思想上的一次决战。师哲说，我们中国目前正在进行的反右派斗争，也是两条路线上的大是大非问题。我们完全相信社会主义一定要胜利，资本主义决不可能在中国复辟。同时我们还必须在城市、工厂、企业、农村广泛开展社会主义宣传运动，让广大的劳动人民清楚地知道前进的道路和目标，知道正是党带领着他们向社会主义前进。
    师哲说，其次，依靠谁建设社会主义的问题，在苏联也有过争论。苏联党把一切胡言乱语都驳倒了，确定依靠本国、依靠劳动群众、力争外援的方针。“自力更生，力争外援”，也是我国建设的方针。我们中国人民要学习苏联人民的顽强斗争，坚持不懈，不达目的，誓不休止的工作精神和革命意志。
    第三，是怎样建设的问题。苏联是确定全面发展工农业，优先发展重工业的方针。这一方针的正确性在以后的若干年中，尤其在苏联伟大卫国战争中得到胜利的考验。我国也是执行工农业并举，同时优先发展重工业的方针；虽然一些别有用心的分子对我国优先发展重工业的方针曾有许多责难，但这一方针是不可动摇的。
    第四，是建立和发展自己的知识分子队伍的问题。苏共在这方面花了很大力量。当时抽调了大批工农干部和劳动人民的子弟入学培养，或者送到国外去留学。同时又将大批青年学生包括干部子弟，送到工厂或农庄，参加劳动，帮助工作，几年后再继续学习或入伍。师哲说，到工厂农村学到的是实际知识，这比坐在学校板凳上得到的知识要宝贵得多。这证明我们党中央提倡各级干部，特别是知识分子参加劳动的正确性和必要性。
    师哲说，苏联人民四十年来所以取得这样的伟大成就，除马列主义思想指导，共产党的正确政策和领导外，也可以用勤、俭两字把它概括起来。我们中国人民要把我们这个人口多、耕地少、底子薄的国家建成一个繁荣富强的国家，就必需克勤克俭。　（新华社专稿）
