    The Important Thing is to Reform
    Currently, judging from the situation in many units, the momentum for improving work is not strong. There hasn't been the same kind of energy put into improving work as there was in the anti-Rightist struggle. A relatively common phenomenon is that when the anti-Rightist struggle began, and the spearhead of the movement was directed at the Rightists, the main energy of the masses was concentrated on anti-Rightism, some leaders relaxed their efforts to improve work. Some excessively emphasized that some of the criticisms made by the masses were incorrect and one-sided, failing to see the many urgent problems existing in their own units, and instead feeling that the problems were not significant. Others emphasized that the task of the anti-Rightist struggle was heavy and that it was impossible to improve work at the same time, or wanted to wait until the anti-Rightist struggle was completely victorious before making changes. Therefore, some problems that should be changed, must be changed, and could be changed were not actively studied and improved, and even some problems that could be changed immediately were not promptly improved. This practice and attitude are obviously wrong. If this continues, it will affect the current work, affect the mood of the masses, and prevent the rectification movement from achieving practical results and becoming a driving force for promoting various tasks. The anti-Rightist struggle is an arduous and complex task, and it will take a long time to achieve a complete victory, but we must never use this as an excuse to say that we cannot improve our work or that we will not improve our work. Facts have proved that although the anti-Rightist struggle is very intense, as long as the leadership attaches importance to it, on the one hand, it should organize a certain force to investigate and study the problems raised by the masses in the blooming and contending, and focus on improving the key issues and those that can be improved. On the other hand, it should combine this with the current tasks, and improve the work based on the opinions of the masses and past experiences and lessons, so that the current work can be done better. As for the leadership's style of work not being thorough, not being close to the masses, ideological work being weak, and not participating in physical labor, etc., as long as the leading cadres are determined and make careful arrangements, these can be improved.

专栏：报刊论文摘要

    重要的在于改
    目前，从许多单位的情况来看，改进工作的劲头不大，还没有拿出像反右派那样的劲头来改进工作。比较普遍的现象是：当反右派斗争开始，运动的矛头指向右派，群众的主要精力集中于反右派以后，有些领导者对改进工作放松了。有的过分地强调了群众的批评意见中有一部分是错误的、片面的，看不到本单位存在的许多急待解决的问题，反觉得问题不大，也有的强调反右派的斗争任务重，无法同时改进工作，或想等到反右派斗争彻底胜利后再改。因此，一些应当改、必须改、可能改的问题，没有积极地去研究改进，甚至一些可以马上改的问题也得不到及时的改进。这种做法和态度显然是不对的，长此下去，会影响当前的工作，影响到群众的情绪，使整风运动不能取得切实的效果，成为推动各项工作的动力。反右派斗争是一个艰巨复杂的任务，要取得彻底胜利，是需要作长时间的斗争，但绝不能因此而借口说无法改进工作或不去改进工作。事实证明，虽然反右派斗争是很紧张的，但只要领导上重视，一方面组织一定的力量，对群众在鸣放中提出的问题，作调查研究，抓住重点与可能改的加以改进，另一方面，应结合当前各项工作，根据群众意见和过去的经验教训，加以改进，使当前的工作做得更好。至于领导作风不深入、不接近群众、思想工作薄弱、参加体力劳动等等，只要领导干部痛下决心，认真安排，更是能够改进的。（摘自10月5日山东大众日报社论：“重要的在于改”）
