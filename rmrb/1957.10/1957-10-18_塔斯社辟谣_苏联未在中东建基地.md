    TASS Denies
    Soviet Union Not Building Bases in the Middle East
    Xinhua News Agency, October 17th -- TASS released a statement on the 16th stating that the Turkish newspaper "Milliyet" and Agence France-Presse reported on October 10th that the Soviet Union intends to establish a naval base in Syria, close to Latakia. On the same day, United Press International spread the rumor that the Soviet Union had begun constructing a military airport near Sana'a in Yemen.
    TASS is authorized to declare that these reports are not true, are complete fabrications, and are intended to justify the hostile activities of certain aggressive groups against Syria and Yemen.

    塔斯社辟谣
    苏联未在中东建基地
    新华社17日讯　塔斯社在16日发表的一项声明说，土耳其“民族报”和法新社10月10日报道说苏联打算在叙利亚境内紧挨拉塔基亚的地方建立海军基地。同一天，合众社谣传苏联已经开始在也门萨那市附近建筑军用机场。
    塔斯社受权声明，这些消息都不符合事实，是彻头彻尾的捏造，其目的是为某些侵略集团对叙利亚和也门进行的敌对活动辩护。
