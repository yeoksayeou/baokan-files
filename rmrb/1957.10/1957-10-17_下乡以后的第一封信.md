　　The First Letter After Going to the Countryside
　　Wu Hua:

　　It has been half a month since I left Beijing. The provincial authorities attach great importance to this group of people from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League who came to Shaanxi. As soon as we arrived, they held a welcome meeting and mobilized the organizations directly under the provincial Party committee and the youth of Xi'an to participate in labor and go to the countryside to participate in labor training. At the meeting, many cadres also expressed their willingness to go down with us. A day later, a surge of enthusiasm for participating in labor training was set off in the organizations.

　　The province originally selected the Yan'an area for us because the food is better and the work foundation is also good. Later, after we considered it, we felt that this might not be suitable for us. When we came, Comrade Luo Yi said that we should go to more difficult places. We discussed it with the province and told them the requirements of the Secretariat for us. Finally, it was decided that we would be divided into two counties, one is Suide County and the other is Mizhi County. The two places are only forty kilometers apart, and it takes two hours by car to get there.

　　After leaving Xi'an, the first day we arrived in Tongchuan, which is a mining area. It looks less prosperous than Xi'an, but it is considered relatively wealthy in Guanzhong. After Tongchuan, it is northern Shaanxi. Here are mountains everywhere, and there are fewer crops, and they are all planted on the slopes of the mountains, which do not grow very well. The people's lives are significantly worse than in Guanzhong. Everywhere is loess, and the sandstorms are much larger than the wind and sand in Beijing.

　　We arrived in Yan'an on the evening of the 24th and stayed in Yan'an for two days. Yan'an is now better constructed, the streets are still wide, but the dust is also very heavy. We spent a day visiting Chairman Mao's former residence - Yan Garden, as well as the former residences of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De and Ren Bishi. Yan Garden is twenty miles away from the hotel where we stayed. We went in the morning and returned in the evening, watching very carefully. At that time, the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee lived in very simple conditions, even without a decent table and chair. From here, thinking of starting from living in mountain ravines to building such a large country, it is really not easy. It is nonsense to say that there are no achievements. Therefore, we should better defend the fruits of socialism, rather than complaining everywhere.

　　The weather here changes greatly, and we wear cotton clothes in the morning and evening. There is a popular saying: "Wear cotton-padded jackets in the morning and gauze in the afternoon, eat watermelon around the stove." It is true. We were frozen when we first arrived in Yan'an. When we washed our faces in the morning, our hands and feet hurt. We put on cotton long johns, sweaters, and cotton-padded jackets, but it seemed that we could not resist the cold wave; by noon, we were overheated again. That day, when we went to visit, we wore cotton-padded clothes, and in the middle of the trip, we took off all our sweaters and cotton-padded clothes; in the evening, we put them all back on. Later, it was the same every day. Now we are used to it, adding clothes when it is time, and reducing clothes when it is time. If we don't do this, we will easily catch a cold.

　　We left Yan'an for a day and arrived in Suide, where we stayed for two days. Suide County also held a welcome meeting. At the welcome meeting, there was a very wonderful program. The students of Suide Normal School heard that we were coming and wrote a song on the spot, which was matched with the tune of Shaanbei folk songs. It was very nice, but I didn't remember it, which is a pity. That day, the inside and outside of the venue was crowded with people. Later, there was also a ball game. It is said that the news of the ball game has been posted all over the city. Playing ball with the comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League is probably a rare thing for them. The comrades here regard our arrival as a major event, and their concern for us is really meticulous and very enthusiastic, which makes it difficult for us to handle. The day we arrived in Suide, it was already very late, but the county Party secretary, county magistrate, director of the county women's federation, secretary of the county Communist Youth League, and all the more responsible cadres came to the station to pick us up. The secretary of the Yulin Prefectural Committee also rushed to see us and arranged our living schedule and labor location. After we arrived, we were treated like a banquet. Of course, we were ashamed of it and immediately put forward our opinions, but they thought this was a small gesture to express their welcome to us. They said: "People in northern Shaanxi have a habit, once they are prepared, they must eat it. The folks are also like this." We were not good at refusing. We also thought that we have not made any contributions, and we have not even started working yet! We are treated like this only because we come from central organizations. The comrades here are always very kind to the comrades from the central organizations, and at the same time, they are expressing their welcome and support for the call of the Party Central Committee.

　　There are many old comrades here, many of whom joined the revolution in 1937 and 1938. Some of the commune cadres are old guerrilla captains. I very much hope to hear some revolutionary stories, but I can't write well even if I hear them, so it's useless, but it will definitely have a great educational effect on myself.

　　We will stay here for two days before going down because they still have to introduce us to some situations, and also invite the commune cadres to come and let everyone get to know each other so that we can understand the commune's situation. The place to go has been determined. I am going to Xingsheng Commune, Luojiaqiao Village, Yangjiagou Township, Taozhen District, Mizhi. If there is anything you want to tell me, you can write to the commune to forward it. Of course, I still hope that you will not only write to me when you have something to notify me, but write to me more often to help me better exercise myself.

### 下乡以后的第一封信

　　下乡以后的第一封信
　　伍骅××：
    离开北京已经半个月了。我们团中央的这批人到陕西来，省里很重视，在我们一到之后，就举行了一个欢迎会，同时动员省委直属机关和西安市青年参加劳动和下乡参加劳动锻炼，会上也有不少干部表示要和我们一样下去。一天之后，机关里就掀起了参加劳动锻炼的热潮。
    省里原来为我们挑选的地方是延安专区一带，这一带吃的比较好，工作基础也好。后来我们考虑了一下，觉得这对我们来说，不一定合适。来的时候，罗毅同志说应该到比较艰苦的地方去，我们就同省里商量了一下，说了书记处对我们的要求，最后确定我们这些人分开到两个县，一个是绥德县，一个是米脂县，两地仅相差四十公里，坐汽车二小时便可到。
    离开西安之后，第一天到铜川，这是一个矿区，看起来就不如西安那边富裕，可是也算关中比较富裕的。过了铜川，就是陕北。这里到处是山，庄稼较少，而且都是种在山坡上，长的不很好，人民生活显著地不如关中，到处是黄土，比起北京刮的风沙，要大得多。
    我们是24日晚上到达延安的，在延安停了二天。延安现在建设的较好，街道还宽，但是灰沙也很大。我们用了一天的时间参观了毛主席的故居——延园，还有刘少奇、周恩来、朱德和任弼时等同志的故居。延园离我们住的旅馆有二十里地，我们早上去晚上回，看的很仔细。那时候，党中央负责同志住的是很简陋，甚至连一张像样的桌子和椅子也没有。从这里，联想到从住山沟开始，到建设这样一个大的国家，真不容易，说没有成绩，那当然是瞎话。因此更应该更好地保卫社会主义果实，而不是到处叫不满。
    这边的天气变化很大，早晚都穿上棉衣。有句流行的话：“早穿棉袄午穿纱，围着火炉吃西瓜。”真是这样，我们刚到延安那一天，可把我们冻坏了，早上洗脸时，冻的手脚都疼，我们把棉毛裤、毛衣、棉袄全穿上了，好像还抵挡不了这寒流；到了中午，却又热坏了。那天参观时，穿着棉衣去，中途又把毛衣棉衣全部脱下；到了晚上，又全部穿上。后来每天都是如此。现在我们已经习惯了，到时增加衣服，到时减少衣服，不这样，就很容易感冒。
    从延安走了一天，到绥德，在那里耽搁了两天。绥德县也开了一个欢迎会，在欢迎会上，有一个很精彩的节目，就是绥德师范的同学听说我们来了，赶写了一只歌，是用陕北民歌的调子配的，很好听，可是我却没记下来，很遗憾。那天场内场外挤满了人，后来还赛球，据说赛球的新闻已经贴得满城都是。同团中央的同志赛球，恐怕对他们来说，也是难得的事。这里的同志对我们的到来看作是件大事，对我们的关怀实在是无微不至，热情很高，弄的我们挺难办的。我们到绥德的那天，已经很晚了，可是县委书记、县长、县妇联主任、团县委书记和所有较负责的干部都到车站来接。榆林地委书记也赶来看我们，为我们安排生活日程和劳动的地点。我们到了之后，又像宴会似地招待我们，我们当然受之有愧，立即提出我们的意见，可是他们认为这是他们对我们表示欢迎的小意思，他们说：“陕北人有个习惯，既准备好，就要吃，老乡们也是这样。”我们也就不大好拒绝了。我们也想到，我们并没有什么功劳，也还没有开始劳动哩！受到他们这样招待，只是因为我们是从中央机关来的。这里的同志对中央机关来的同志总是倍加亲切的，同时也是对党中央的号召表示欢迎和拥护。
    这里老同志很多，很多都是1937、1938年参加革命的，有的社干部都是老游击队长，我很希望能够听到一些革命故事，不过我听了写不好，也没用，但对自己一定有很大教育作用。
    我们在这里要住上两天才下去，因为他们还要向我们介绍些情况，还要请社里干部来，大家认识一下，让我们了解社里的情况。去的地方已确定，我是去米脂桃镇区杨家沟乡罗家?村兴盛社。如果有什么事要告诉我，可以写信请社里转。当然，我还是愿意你们不是只通知我什么事才来信，而是多多写信给我，帮助我更好地锻炼自己。
