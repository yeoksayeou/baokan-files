Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 29th: Ishida Yūzen, head of the Japanese Agricultural and Farmers Delegation and vice president of the Japan Farmers' Association, issued a written statement in Guangzhou on the 29th regarding his impressions of his visit to China. He stated that the delegation, invited by the Chinese Agronomy Society, had conducted inspections and visits in Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South regions for over a month. The delegation expressed its deep gratitude for the support and warm welcome given to the Japanese people by the Chinese people.

Ishida Yūzen's statement said: "This visit has provided us with many valuable experiences.

	First, China's socialist construction is being carried out on the basis of strong support from the entire nation.
	Second, the speed of this construction is extremely fast.
	Third, not only has industrial construction been impressive but also the development of the agricultural cooperative movement has achieved remarkable results in the basic construction of rural society."

The statement said: "The focus of our visit was to specifically understand the development of the cooperative movement after the land reform and the actual situation of Chinese agriculture after liberation, and we have concluded an agreement on agricultural exchanges. During visits to fifteen different agricultural cooperatives, we inspected the actual situation in the countryside and had heart-to-heart talks with individual farmers, exchanging opinions without any barriers.

	"Through these contacts, we were able to better understand Chinese agriculture and farmers. At the same time, we believe that the opinions on agricultural exchanges will be consistent with those of the Chinese Agronomy Society.

	"Although we are about to return home safely, after returning, all members of the delegation will accurately convey the actual situation in China to the Japanese people throughout the country, in order to promote mutual understanding and deepen friendship between the people of the two countries, especially the farmers, and further strengthen agricultural and farmer exchanges between Japan and China. Through these exchanges, we hope to promote the early restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and are willing to work together to safeguard Asian peace.

	"Finally, I wish everyone good health, and once again express our vow to work hard for the further development of Sino-Japanese friendship."

Yesterday afternoon, at a symposium held by the Guangdong branch of the Chinese Agronomy Society, ten members of the delegation offered opinions on China's agricultural production, technological reforms, and other aspects. They particularly mentioned the issues of increasing yield per unit area and giving full play to labor potential.

The delegation will leave Guangzhou tomorrow to return home.

    据新华社广州29日电　日本农业农民访华代表团团长、日本农民协会副会长石田宥全29日在广州发表书面的访华观感说，代表团应中国农学会邀请在东北、华北、华东、中南地区各地进行了一个多月的访问视察。代表团对中国人民给予日本人民的支持和热烈的欢迎表示深深感谢。
    石田宥全发表的声明说：“这次视察曾学到了许多宝贵的经验。
    第一、中国的社会主义建设是在全国人民强烈支持的基础上进行的；
    第二、这个建设的速度极快；
    第三、不仅由于工业建设而且由于发展农业的合作化运动，使农村社会的基本建设取得了令人注目的成就。”
    声明说：“我们这次视察的重点，在于具体了解土地改革后的合作化运动发展情况和解放后中国农业实况，并已缔结了有关农业交流的协定。在十五个各样的农业合作社访问的时候，视察了农村实况，并与个个农民促膝相谈，毫无隔阂地交换了意见。
      “通过这些接触，使我们能对中国农业和农民更好的了解，同时有关农业交流的问题，相信会与中国农学会之间的意见一致的。
      “我们虽将要平安归国，但归国后全体团员将在全国各地向日本人民正确地传达中国的实况，借以促进两国人民特别是农民之间相互了解、加深友谊，并进一步加强日中两国之间农业农民的交流。通过这些交流，以便促进日中邦交早日恢复，并愿共同为保卫亚洲和平而努力。
      “最后，祝有关各位身体健康，并再一次表示誓为日中友好的进一步发展而努力。”
    昨天下午，在中国农学会广东分会召开的座谈会上，代表团中的十位团员对中国的农业生产、技术改革等方面提出了意见，他们特别提到了关于提高单位面积产量与发挥劳动力潜能的问题。
    代表团将在明天离开广州回国。
