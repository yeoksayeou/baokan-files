    Wuxi City Sends More Than 1,200 Cadres Downward
    Most Will Go to Rural Areas to Participate in Production
    (Our Newspaper) News: In the rectification movement, the city and district-level organs in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, have further streamlined their structures.

    In the first half of this year, various organs also underwent streamlining, abolishing nine units including the Rural Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee and six professional offices of the Municipal People's Committee, and sending 362 cadres at all levels downward. However, in the past, due to a lack of strong determination, the phenomena of overlapping institutions and overstaffing were not fundamentally eliminated.

    In September, the Party and government leading organs of the city, in the spirit of rectifying while correcting, and following the principles of "streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the grassroots" and "determining institutions according to tasks and personnel according to workload," re-formulated a plan for the reorganization of organs. Based on the reorganization in the first half of the year, they decided to vigorously cut and merge 17 more institutions. For example, after the Textile Industry Department and the Light and Heavy Industry Department of the Municipal Party Committee were merged into the Industry Department, the Transportation and Postal and Telecommunications Department is now being merged into the Industry Department. Institutions that are not merged are also streamlining their staffing, requiring that the total number of staff in the city's organs be reduced by 25%-30%, and that more than 1,200 staff members be sent downward. Among these, in addition to some being sent to the grassroots to strengthen the leading backbone, the majority will participate in labor production, mainly agricultural production.

    This plan is being gradually implemented. For example, the Light Industry Bureau and the Heavy Industry Bureau have been merged into the Light and Heavy Industry Bureau; the Real Estate Management Bureau has been merged into the Service Bureau, and another 97 cadres have been sent downward recently.

    无锡市机关人员下放一千二百多人
    多数将到农村参加生产
    本报讯　江苏省无锡市市、区级机关，在整风运动中进一步紧缩机构。
    今年上半年，各机关也进行了紧缩，撤销了市委农村工作部、市人民委员会六个专业办公室等九个单位，下放各级干部三百六十二人。但过去由于决心不大，机构重叠和人浮于事的现象基本上没有得到消除。
    9月份，该市党、政领导机关本着边整边改的精神，按照“紧缩上层，充实基层”和
  “按任务定机构，按工作量定人员”等原则，重新制订了机关整编方案，决定在上半年整编的基础上再大力裁并十七个机构。如市委纺织工业部与轻重工业部合并为工业部后，现又将交通邮电部并入工业部；不裁并的机构也紧缩编制，要求全市机关编制人数将紧缩25％—30％，下放工作人员一千二百多人，其中除部分下放基层充实领导骨干外，多数将参加劳动生产，主要是农业生产。
    这一方案正在逐步实现，如轻工业局和重工业局已合并为轻重工业局；房产管理局已并入服务局，最近已下放的干部又有九十七人。
