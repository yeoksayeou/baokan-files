Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: The State Economic Commission has comprehensively entered the third stage of the rectification movement. The commission proposed to focus on inspecting the implementation of the policy of building the nation through thrift and diligence and the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture under the premise of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. It aims to launch extensive airing of views, debates, and overcome errors and shortcomings such as bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism in leadership work.

Bo Yibo, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Economic Commission, on behalf of the leading group for the rectification campaign of the commission, gave a mobilization report to all Communist Party members of the agency on the 23rd. In addition to conveying the important issues discussed at the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, he called on all Party member leading cadres and all Party members to be determined to "ignite the fire on themselves," create a wave of extensive airing of views and debates, and resolutely and thoroughly rectify and improve leadership and work styles.

In his report, Bo Yibo pointed out that the State Economic Commission should focus on the following nine aspects for rectification: First, inspect whether the principle of building the country through thrift and diligence, running enterprises through thrift and diligence, running cooperatives through thrift and diligence, and managing households through thrift and diligence has been conscientiously implemented in the process of formulating and implementing the national annual economic construction plan, that is, whether the principle of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results has been conscientiously implemented. Bo Yibo said that any doubt or wavering about this principle is wrong. This principle must continue to be implemented in national construction in the future. Second, whether the principle of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture under the premise of prioritizing the development of heavy industry has been conscientiously implemented in our country's annual economic plan. This issue should be carefully inspected because it is an important principle for building socialism better and faster.

The third issue Bo Yibo talked about was to conscientiously examine the system, regulations, and methods related to the formulation of economic plans, and to examine whether there is bureaucracy and subjectivism in this regard that hinders the initiative of all employees and local initiative. Fourth, in our country's economic construction, whether the principle of conscientiously learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries and combining it with China's specific conditions has been effectively implemented; whether the principle of adapting to local conditions and adapting to specific circumstances has been conscientiously implemented. Fifth, it is necessary to earnestly examine and correct the situation of bloated institutions and large personnel establishments. Sixth, in terms of the relationship between the Party and the masses, it is necessary to focus on examining the problem of sectarianism and various work styles that are divorced from the masses, and to examine the tendencies of Party member cadres towards special treatment in work and living standards. Seventh, in the relationship between leaders and those being led, focus on opposing bureaucracy and commandism in leadership style. In particular, the bad work style of not delving into the masses to study specific businesses, not using one's brains, and only relying on orders must be resolutely eliminated. Eighth, examine and correct unreasonable phenomena in the implementation of cadre policies and wage and welfare measures. Ninth, in terms of the ideological style of cadres, especially the ideological style of Party member leading cadres, it is necessary to focus on examining whether they have been corrupted by bourgeois ideology and work style after entering the city.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the third stage of the rectification and achieve timely rectification, the director, deputy directors, and members of the Economic Commission have made specific divisions of labor. They all directly participate in their respective grassroots units and launch extensive airing of views and debates together with the masses, so that leading cadres can directly strengthen the specific leadership of the rectification units, and listen to the opinions of the masses and solve problems in a timely manner.

In order to enable the various business departments and provincial and municipal localities under the State Council to supervise the rectification work of the State Economic Commission in a timely manner and to discover errors and shortcomings that the Economic Commission itself finds difficult to discover, the Economic Commission will also hold various professional meetings in the third stage of the rectification in a timely manner to strengthen ties with various departments and provinces and cities.

    检查执行勤俭建国和工农业同时并举方针的情况
    国家经委会提出整改重点
    新华社28日讯　国家经济委员会已开始全面转入整风运动第三阶段。这个委员会提出要以检查贯彻勤俭建国方针和在优先发展重工业的前提下工农业同时并举的方针等作为重点，展开大鸣大放、大争大辩，克服领导工作中的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义等错误和缺点。
    国务院副总理、国家经济委员会主任薄一波代表这个机关的整风领导小组在23日给机关的全体共产党员做了动员报告，除传达党的三中全会讨论的各项重要问题外，他号召所有党员领导干部和全体党员要下决心“引火烧身”，造成大鸣大放大争大辩的热潮，坚决彻底地整顿和改进领导和工作作风。
    薄一波在报告中指出国家经济委员会要以下面九个方面作为整改的重点：第一、检查在编制和执行国家年度经济建设计划的过程中，是否认真贯彻了勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办合作社和勤俭持家的方针，即是否认真贯彻执行了多快好省的方针。薄一波说，对这个方针的任何怀疑和动摇，是错误的。今后在国家建设中还必须继续贯彻这个方针。第二、在我们国家的年度经济计划中，是否认真贯彻执行了在优先发展重工业的前提下工农业同时并举的方针，这个问题应该很好地检查，因为它是能够更好更快地建设社会主义的一个重要方针。
    薄一波谈到的第三个问题是，认真检查有关编制经济计划的体制、制度和方法，检查在这方面是否存在着妨碍发挥全体职工的积极性和地方的积极性的官僚主义和主观主义。第四、在我国的经济建设中，是否切实执行了认真学习苏联和其他国家先进经验和我国具体情况相结合的方针；是否认真贯彻了因地制宜、因事制宜的方针。第五、要切实检查和改正机构臃肿和人员编制庞大的情况。第六、在党和群众的关系方面，要着重检查宗派主义的毛病和各种脱离群众的作风，检查党员干部在工作和生活待遇上的特殊化倾向。第七、在领导和被领导的关系上，着重反对领导作风上的官僚主义和命令主义。特别是不深入群众研究具体业务、不用脑筋、只靠命令行事的恶劣作风，必须坚决铲除。第八、检查和纠正在执行干部政策和工资福利措施方面的不合理现象。第九、在干部思想作风特别是党员领导干部的思想作风方面，要着重检查进城以后是否受到了资产阶级思想作风的腐蚀。
    为了加强对整风第三阶段的领导和做到及时整改，现在经济委员会的主任、副主任和委员已做了具体分工，他们都直接参加所属各个基层单位，同群众一起大鸣大放、大争大辩，以便使领导干部直接加强整风单位的具体领导，并且倾听群众意见，及时解决问题。
    为使国务院所属各个业务部和省、市地方能及时监督国家经济委员会的整改工作，及时发现经委本身难于发现的错误和缺点，经委还将在整风第三阶段中及时召开各种专业会议，加强同各部和省市的联系。
