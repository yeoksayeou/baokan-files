    Lu Xun and Soviet Literature
    Jin Ren
    In the forty years since the great October Socialist Revolution, Soviet literature has made tremendous achievements. Many Soviet literary works have achieved high international reputation and have become favorite works of people at home and abroad.
    Our country has introduced a large number of Soviet literary works, and these works have given great encouragement to our broad readers.
    When we talk about the introduction of Soviet literature in our country, we cannot help but recall Mr. Lu Xun. Mr. Lu Xun, in his later years, devoted great efforts to introducing Soviet literature, and until now, none of our younger generations has been able to catch up with him.
    As we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, it is also the twenty-first anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's departure from us. It should be very meaningful to talk about Mr. Lu Xun and Soviet literature in order to commemorate Mr. Lu Xun and also to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution.
    First, let's take a look at Mr. Lu Xun's views on Soviet literature.
    Mr. Lu Xun said the following in his article "Congratulating the Exchange of Chinese and Russian Languages" when talking about Soviet literature:
    "For fifteen years, the Soviet Union, regarded as a demon by the imperialists, its literature has been victorious in the world literary scene. The so-called 'victory' here: is to say that with the excellence of its content and technology, it has gained a large number of readers and has given readers many beneficial things."
    What are these beneficial things? According to Mr. Lu Xun, it is the "transformation, struggle, and the hardship and success of construction" carried out by the Soviet people.
    Mr. Lu Xun said these words in 1932, which was the darkest era in China's political life. The reactionary government at that time was extremely hostile to the Soviet Union. It adopted various methods of oppression and prohibition against some Soviet literary works that had just begun to be introduced to China, but Mr. Lu Xun resolutely affirmed the achievements of Soviet literature in such a difficult period, and set an example by introducing many Soviet literary works to China in large quantities and with great effort. Although the pressure from the reactionaries was increasing, it did not frustrate Mr. Lu Xun's confidence. On the contrary, he became stronger and stronger in this work. From 1931 to his death in 1936, Mr. Lu Xun's work in introducing Soviet literature was an important part of his literary activities. We only need to open the twenty volumes of "The Complete Works of Lu Xun" to know this.
    As early as 1925, Mr. Lu Xun had already paid close attention to Soviet literature. On April 12, 1925, he wrote a preface for Ren Guozhen's translation of "Soviet Russian Literary Debate," which fully demonstrated his concern for the newly born literature. From 1929, Mr. Lu Xun began to translate a large number of theoretical works and literary works on Soviet literature and art. In that year, he translated Lunacharsky's "On Art" and "Literature and Criticism." In 1930, he translated Yakovlev's novel "October," and in 1931 he finished translating Fadeyev's "The Rout"; in 1932, he compiled "A Collection of Twenty New Russian Novelists," the first volume of which was titled "Harp" and the second volume "One Day's Work." In 1935, he translated Pantaleev's fairy tale "Watch."
    During this period, in addition to personally translating many Soviet literary works, Mr. Lu Xun also edited and proofread many translations by others, such as He Fei's translation of the first volume of "And Quiet Flows the Don," Cao Jinghua's translation of "Iron Flood" and "Cities and Years," and Qu Qiubai's Soviet literary works in his "Overseas Forest," all of which were personally proofread by Mr. Lu Xun, who also wrote prefaces and postscripts. In the two books "Harp" and "One Day's Work," most of the translated Soviet literary works were edited by others, except for a small part translated by Mr. Lu Xun himself. At the same time, Mr. Lu Xun tried his best to publish translated Soviet literary works in the literary magazines he edited.
    The time when Mr. Lu Xun vigorously introduced and promoted Soviet literature was the most reactionary period in our country's politics. Mr. Lu Xun said in his article "Congratulating the Exchange of Chinese and Russian Languages":
    "During this period, it was naturally attacked by the joint forces of literati, scholars and rogue police dogs. For the introducers, some said it was for rubles, some said it was intended to surrender, some laughed at it as a 'broken gong' [note], some pointed it out as a Communist, and the actual prohibition and confiscation of books were mostly secret, so there is no way to list them."
    He also said:
        "But Russian literature is only introduced and spread.
      ...Soviet literature in our country already has Libedinsky's 'A Week,' Gladkov's 'Cement,' Fadeyev's 'The Rout,' and Serafimovich's 'The Iron Flood'; in addition, there are many more novellas and short stories."
      Of course, the reactionary ruling class would not ignore this situation. With the increase in the translation of Soviet literary works, the reactionaries became even more hostile to Soviet literature and oppressed it even more severely.
    In 1931, Mr. Lu Xun originally planned to compile a "Modern Literature Series" exclusively for new Russian literary works for Shenzhou Guoguang Society, a total of ten books: "Faust and the City," "The Liberated Don Quixote," "October," "Years of Refinement," "Armored Train," "Rebellion," "Fire Horse," "Iron Flood," "The Rout," and "And Quiet Flows the Don." However, because "the oppression of left-wing writers is becoming more and more intense day by day, and finally so intense that bookstores are afraid. Shenzhou Guoguang Society also declared that they are willing to invalidate the old agreement, and the ones that have been handed in will of course be accepted, but the remaining six that have not yet started or have not been translated much must not be continued. So, what should we do? Ask the translators, and they all say, that's okay. This is not because Chinese bookstores are particularly timid, but because the oppression of the Chinese government is particularly fierce..." (See the article "Postscript to the Editing and Proofreading of 'Iron Flood'").
    Although this series of books was not published, the listed book titles finally met the Chinese readers one by one, which of course would arouse the wrath of the reactionaries, so they banned the publication of these books in batches, and even sealed up the printing houses that printed these books and the bookstores that sold these books. They even arrested the translators and readers of these works.
    But what effect did this have? As said in the article "Congratulating the Exchange of Chinese and Russian Languages":
    "Although the exchange of Chinese and Russian languages started later than Chinese and English and Chinese and French, in the past ten years, whether the two countries broke off relations or resumed relations, our mass of readers did not advance or retreat because of this; whether the translation was allowed or suppressed, our readers would never flourish or decline because of this. Not only as usual, but also expanded; not only as usual despite the severance of relations and suppression, but also expanded even more despite the severance of relations and suppression."
    This was the specific response of the Chinese people to the reactionaries at that time. They loved Soviet literary works very much, regardless of whether you severed relations or suppressed them. It was this point that gave Mr. Lu Xun infinite strength, making him more loving towards Soviet literature and working harder to introduce more of it.
    Now Soviet literature has blossomed brilliantly and borne abundant fruits on the land of our country. How can we not think of Mr. Lu Xun at such a time?
    Some right-wing elements in the literary world claim to be "students of Lu Xun," but they slander Soviet literature. This is completely contrary to Mr. Lu Xun's spirit of cherishing Soviet literature. They are not students of Lu Xun, but traitors of Lu Xun.
    [Note] "Broken gong" is a homonym for "Pro," which was a saying used by the reactionaries at that time to slander "Proletarian Literature."

    鲁迅和苏联文学
    金人
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命以来的四十年间，苏联的文学有了极为巨大的成绩。许多苏联文学作品都取得了很高的国际声誉，成了国内外人民喜爱的作品。
    我国大量介绍了苏联的文学作品，这些作品给予我国广大读者以很大的鼓舞作用。
    我们在谈到苏联文学在我国的介绍情况的时候，就不由自主地要回忆到鲁迅先生。鲁迅先生在他的后半生里，在介绍苏联文学方面尽了极大的力量，直到现在，我们后辈还没有一个能赶得上他。
    正当我们纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，鲁迅先生也离开我们二十一周年了，为了纪念鲁迅先生，同时也为了纪念十月革命四十周年，来谈谈鲁迅先生和苏联文学的问题，应该是很有意义的吧。
    首先我们看看鲁迅先生对苏联文学的看法吧。
    鲁迅先生在“祝中俄文字之交”一文里谈到苏联文学的时候说：
    “十五年以来，被帝国主义者看作恶魔的苏联，那文学，在世界文坛上，是胜利的。这里的所谓‘胜利’：是说，以它的内容和技术的杰出，而得到广大的读者，并且给与了读者许多有益的东西。”
    这些有益的东西是什么呢？照鲁迅先生的说法，就是苏联人民所进行的“变革，战斗，建设的辛苦和成功。”
    鲁迅先生说这些话是在1932年，那时候正是中国政治生活上最黑暗的时代，那时的反动政府对苏联是极端仇视的。对于刚刚开始介绍到中国来的一些苏联的文学作品，采取了各种各样的压迫和禁止的办法，但是鲁迅先生却在这样的艰苦时期，毅然决然地肯定了苏联的文学成绩，并且以身作则地大量和努力地介绍了许多苏联的文学作品到中国来。反动派的压力虽然越来越大，但这并不能挫折鲁迅先生的信心，他在这个工作上反而越战越强了。从1931年到他的逝世——1936年，这几年间鲁迅先生介绍苏联文学的工作，是他的文学活动的重要的组成部分，我们只要翻开二十本的鲁迅全集来看看就可以知道了。
    远在1925年的时候，鲁迅先生就已经很注意苏联的文学问题了。1925年4月12日，为任国桢译的“苏俄文艺论战”写了一篇前记，这篇文章完全表明了他对于刚刚诞生的新文学的关心。1929年起，鲁迅先生就开始大量翻译有关苏联文学艺术问题的理论著作和文学作品。这一年就译成了卢那察尔斯基的“艺术论”和“文艺与批评”。1930年译成雅各武莱夫的长篇小说“十月”，1931年译完法捷耶夫的“毁灭”；1932年编译“新俄小说作家二十人集”，上册名曰“竖琴”，下册名曰“一天的工作”。1935年译班台莱夫童话“表”。
    在这个时期，鲁迅先生除了亲自动手翻译许多苏联文学作品之外，还编辑校订了许多别人的译品，如贺非译的“静静的顿河”第一部上卷，曹靖华译的“铁流”和“城与年”，瞿秋白的海上述林的苏联文学作品部分，都是由鲁迅先生亲自校订，并写了前记、后记。“竖琴”和“一天的工作”两书当中，除了小部分是鲁迅先生自己的翻译以外，大部分是编辑别人翻译的苏联文学作品。同时鲁迅先生在他所主编的文学刊物上竭力刊登翻译的苏联文学作品。
    鲁迅先生大力介绍和提倡苏联文学的时候，正是我国政治上最反动的时期。鲁迅先生在“祝中俄文字之交”一文里说：
      “这之间，自然又遭了文人学士和流氓警犬的联军的讨伐。对于绍介者，
    有的说是为了卢布，有的说是意在投降，有的笑为“破锣”?，有的指为共党，
    而实际上的对于书籍的禁止和没收，还因为是秘密的居多，无从列举。”
    又说：
        “但俄国文学只是绍介进来，传布开去。
      ……苏联文学在我们却已有了里培进斯基的‘一周间’，革拉特珂夫的‘士敏土’，法捷耶夫的‘毁灭’，绥拉菲摩维支的‘铁流’；此外中篇短篇，
    还多得很。”
      当然，反动的统治阶级是不会忽视这种情形的。随着苏联文学作品翻译的增多，反动派对苏联文学就更加仇视了，压迫得更加厉害了。
    鲁迅先生在1931年本来打算给神州国光社编一套专收新俄文艺作品的“现代文艺丛书”，共计十本：“浮士德与城”，“被解放的堂·吉诃德”，“十月”，“精光的年头”，“铁甲列车”，“叛乱”，“火马”，“铁流”，“毁灭”和“静静的顿河”。然而由于“对于左翼作家的压迫，是一天一天的吃紧起来，终于紧到使书店都骇怕了。神州国光社也来声明，愿意将旧约作废，已经交去的当然收下，但尚未开手或译得不多的其余六种，却千万勿再进行了。那么，怎么办呢？去问译者，都说，可以的。这并不是中国书店的胆子特别小，实在是中国官府的压迫特别凶……”（见“‘铁流’编校后记”一文）。
    这一套丛书虽然没有出成，但是所列的书名，终于还是一本一本地和中国读者见了面，这当然更会惹起反动派的震怒，于是也就一批一批地把这些书禁止发行，甚至于查封印这些书的印刷所和售卖这些书的书店。甚至于逮捕这些作品的译者和读者。
    但是这有什么效果呢？正如在“祝中俄文字之交”一文中所说的：
    “中俄的文字之交，开始虽然比中英中法迟，但在近十年中，两国的绝交也好，复交也好，我们的读者大众却不因此而进退；译本的放任也好、禁压也好，我们的读者也决不因此而盛衰。不但如常，而且扩大；不但虽绝交和禁压还是如常，而且虽绝交和禁压而更加扩大。”
    这就是中国人民在当时给予反动派的具体答复，他们不管你绝交也好，禁压也好，对于苏联的文学作品是非常喜爱的。正是这一点也就给与鲁迅先生以无穷的力量，使他对苏联文学更加热爱，更加努力多介绍一些。
    现在苏联的文学在我国的土地上，已经开出灿烂的花朵，结下了肥硕的果实。我们在这样的时候，怎么能不想到鲁迅先生？
    有些文学界的右派分子，他们自称是“鲁迅的学生”，但是他们对于苏联的文学却横加污蔑。这和鲁迅先生对苏联文学的爱护精神是完全背道而驰的。他们不是鲁迅的学生，而是鲁迅的叛徒。
    〔注〕“破锣”是“普罗”的谐音，这是当时反动派污蔑“普罗文学”的说法。
