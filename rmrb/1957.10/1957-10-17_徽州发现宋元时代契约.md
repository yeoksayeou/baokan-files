　　Discovery of Song and Yuan Dynasty Contracts in Huizhou

　　We saw many contracts for buying and selling land in the old society during the land reform, but we saw very few contracts from older eras. Recently, the Tunxi branch of the Xinhua Bookstore has been salvaging ancient books and cultural relics, and has successively discovered a large number of land and forest sales contracts dating back to the Song and Yuan dynasties in rural areas.

　　These contracts were discovered in the Qimen and Xiuning areas, and most of them were preserved in the homes of the original landlords and rich peasants. Among them, the Chunyou contract from the Song Dynasty was discovered in Nanxiang, Qimen. It is clearly written on it that it is a contract from the twelfth year of Chunyou (1252 AD). The contract is stamped with a large vermilion official seal, dating back 700 years. The contract from the third year of Yuantong in the Yuan Dynasty (1335 AD) was also discovered in the same place, and the paper is covered with square official seals. Other contracts, such as those from the Ming Dynasty, range from Hongwu to Hongguang, and exist for every dynasty. The monetary systems of each dynasty in China were different, and this is reflected in these contracts. For example, the Song Dynasty used strings of cash, the Yuan Dynasty used paper money, and the monetary system in the early Ming Dynasty was not yet unified. In addition to using silver and paper money, there were also instances of using silk, rice, satin, and silk fabrics to replace currency. It was not until after the Jiajing period that silver was used uniformly. If the contracts of each dynasty are connected year by year, they will become important materials for studying economic history.

　　In addition, there were also discoveries of loan note covers from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. These were engraved with colorful prints with fine carving and bright colors. In particular, the loan notes engraved by Hu Yuecong of Dazhi, Shexian in the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, with the "Shizhuzhai" mark on them, were printed in five colors using relief printing, which is even rarer.

　　徽州发现宋元时代契约
    旧社会买卖田地的契约，我们在土地改革中见到很多，但年代久远的契约见到极少。近来新华书店屯溪支店在抢救古图书文物中，却陆续在农村发现了大批的远至宋元的田地山林买卖契约。
    这些契约是在祈门休宁一带发现的，大部分是保存在原地主富农的家中。其中宋朝淳祐契纸是在祈门南乡发现的，上面写明是淳祐十二年（公元1252年）契纸上盖有朱色大官印，距今有七百年历史。元朝元统三年（公元1335年）的契纸，也是在同一地方发现，纸上布满方形官印。其它如明朝契约，上至洪武，下至弘光，每个朝代都有。我国历朝币制不同，在这些契纸上也得到反映，如宋朝用贯，元朝用钞，明初币制还未统一，除了有用银、钞以外，还有用丝，稻，缎绢等实物代替货币。到嘉靖以后，才一律用银子。如果将每个朝代的契约逐年连贯起来，就成为研究经济史的重要资料。
    另外还发现有明末清初的借票封面。刻了五彩的版画，刻工精细，颜色鲜明其中尤以明万历大右歙人胡曰从刻的借票，上面有十竹斋记号，是采用凸版五彩精印，更是难得。
