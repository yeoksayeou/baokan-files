The Chemical City on the Banks of the Songhua River
By our reporter Chen Ji

Jilin City is a beautiful ancient city. The Songhua River, like a blue, arc-shaped ribbon, embraces the city. The suburbs are surrounded by towering mountains and the scenery is beautiful. Close to vast rural and mountainous areas, it has always been a distribution center for medicinal materials, timber, and agricultural products. Because of the convenient timber supply, its roads were paved with wood forty or fifty years ago. Its transportation is developed, and it has a reputation as a city of water.

This ancient city, with a history of nearly three hundred years, is no longer known for these superior natural conditions. It has become a heavy industrial city centered on the chemical industry. In the past desolate wilderness, the three major chemical plants—Jilin Fertilizer Plant, Jilin Dyestuff Plant, and Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant—as well as the Jilin Thermal Power Plant serving them, have been built one after another. They were built in just three years, and these three years have completely changed the ancient face of Jilin City. Some people use the phrase "the neck is thicker than the head" to describe the development of the new industrial zone. The total area of the new industrial zone is equal to 143% of the area of the old urban area, and the area of the buildings in the new industrial zone (including factories and employee housing) also greatly exceeds that of the old urban area. A wilderness where only thousands of households lived scattered a few years ago is now a bustling area inhabited by hundreds of thousands of people. The city's total industrial output value is growing rapidly, and it is estimated that the total industrial output value in 1957 will be three times more than the highest year during the puppet Manchurian regime (1943).

Jilin City was originally an ideal place to develop the chemical industry. It has abundant good water sources and a suitable climate, nearby coal and limestone mines, and convenient power supplied by the nearby Fengman Hydropower Station. However, for many years, it was a consumer city. In 1658 (the fifteenth year of the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty), a primitive shipyard was built here, and the city began to be built. Until 1928, there were only some small factories for oil pressing, flour milling, and match making. After the "September 18th Incident," Japanese capitalists took a fancy to this city and formed the so-called "Manchurian Electrical Chemistry Co., Ltd." with the puppet Manchurian regime, planning to build chemical plants here to produce calcium carbide, coke, and synthetic petroleum. They used the blood and sweat of the Chinese people and spent six or seven years building a small calcium carbide plant. This small calcium carbide plant was only the size of one workshop in today's Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant. As for synthetic petroleum, it was never refined. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang "takeover officials" came here and secretly sold calcium carbide on the streets for money, and later simply dismantled machines, demolished factory buildings, and pocketed the money. On the eve of liberation, the city had been destroyed beyond recognition. The broken factory buildings left by the "Manchurian Electrical Chemistry Co., Ltd." became a resting place for hunters catching wild rabbits.

Today, the three major chemical plants have fully utilized these good conditions in Jilin City. The Songhua River's water flows continuously into the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, where it is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen, becoming a component of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. Even the air that is everywhere is used here as an important raw material. For a long time, coal was mostly burned as fuel, but now the three major chemical plants use coal by-products to make many valuable things. Limestone, which has been buried underground for many years, is now used by the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant to make calcium carbide, which has extremely wide uses.

At first glance, the appearance of the three major chemical plants is not very different from that of mechanical factories. Their factory buildings are diverse in form, some tall, some short, some square, some round, some upright, and some inclined. Chimneys soaring into the sky gently spew out yellow, white, and blue smoke. The granulation tower, which is sixty-three meters high and manufactures chemical fertilizers, sends out granular fertilizer like fluttering snowflakes. Huge, cylindrical atmospheric tanks, so large that a dozen people cannot encircle them, lie quietly near the factory buildings. Above the sky and below the ground, between factory buildings, there are crisscrossing pipes of various colors, some very thick, like large chimneys lying on the ground; others are thinner, like water pipes suspended in the air. There are as many as seventy or eighty pipes in the most crowded places, overlapping twenty or thirty layers. The types of pipes are also very complex, including copper pipes, cement pipes, plastic pipes, seamless steel pipes, stainless steel pipes, etc. They have different functions, some are cold-resistant and heat-resistant, and some are acid-resistant and pressure-resistant. The Jilin Fertilizer Plant has a kind of steel pipe that can withstand 320 atmospheres of pressure. Such a large pressure requires a special kind of steel pipe; otherwise, it would explode. The Jilin Fertilizer Plant also has a kind of pipe that has to withstand a low temperature of minus 200 degrees Celsius. Ordinary rubber pipes would break quickly if they encountered such a low temperature. Many pipes must also have strong acid resistance. Someone once accidentally knocked over a sample of nitric acid produced by the Jilin Fertilizer Plant onto terrazzo, and after quickly removing the nitric acid, a layer of skin had been peeled off the terrazzo. How can you produce such products without pipes with strong acid resistance?

The three major chemical plants are all large-scale, technologically advanced, and modern factories. Their factory building structures are very advanced, with a high proportion of high-rise buildings, and factory buildings that are twenty or thirty meters high account for a large proportion. Most of the important process equipment is supplied by the Soviet Union. Their degree of automation is very high, and their production efficiency is very large. Many devices are controlled by instruments. The Jilin Fertilizer Plant alone has more than 10,000 instruments. It was the first time for our country to build such complex large-scale chemical plants. However, under the leadership of the Party and with the specific assistance of Soviet experts, the people who built the three major chemical plants not only completed the construction tasks several months ahead of schedule, but also completed the trial production tasks ahead of schedule. After the Jilin Fertilizer Plant was officially put into production, it would reach its designed production capacity in just a few months. Now, the quality of the products of the three major chemical plants, which have been in trial production for a short time, is very good. The three major chemical plants have cultivated a large number of construction talents for the modern chemical industry. In the future, they will be able to build more chemical plants at a faster speed to support agricultural production. The Jilin Fertilizer Plant was built in just two and a half years. It is estimated that it will only take one and a half years to build a fertilizer plant of this scale in the future using domestically produced equipment and materials.

Usually, when people think of chemical plants, they think of safety issues. Because chemical plants have to deal with toxic gases in production, they have to deal with oxygen that is easy to burn, and they may encounter various accidents. Chemical plants in capitalist countries often have casualties and even explosions. The three major chemical plants that the Soviet Union helped our country design are very safe and comfortable factories. All production equipment and labor protection facilities in the factory can ensure production safety and protect personal health. All production processes that have to deal with toxic gases use machines as much as possible instead of people. Those useless toxic gases are also treated with chemical methods and discharged into the high altitude where people cannot breathe. Unpleasant odors are also removed from the factory as much as possible. The air in the factory is fresh, the temperature is appropriate, and it is warm in winter and cool in summer. Each production plant has ventilation and heating equipment. The Jilin Fertilizer Plant has installed more than 1,000 fans. Walking into the factory building, you feel very happy and comfortable. This is completely different from the chemical plants in capitalist countries. In some famous chemical plants in West Germany, workers can only work there for three years and then cannot continue to work; our three major chemical plants are places where labor is pleasant and work is safe. Of course, it is not that no subjective effort is needed to ensure that no accidents occur at all. The workers of the three major chemical plants all understand this, and they all regard safe production as the most important thing.

The design and equipment of the three major chemical plants are so good, and the construction time is so fast, mainly because of the Soviet Union's selfless and comprehensive assistance. Many Soviet units and factories helped with the design, provided the best equipment, and also sent a large number of experts to provide specific guidance. The Jilin Fertilizer Plant once lacked a triplex plunger pump in a workshop, which could not guarantee early production; a Soviet chemical plant quickly dismantled its spare triplex plunger pump to help the Jilin Fertilizer Plant. Many Soviet experts in the three major chemical plants automatically requested to stay in China for a few more days after their work periods expired to help with construction. The completion of the three major chemical plants is a crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship and a new page in the history of the development of China's chemical industry. (Attached pictures)

    松花江畔的化学城
    本报记者　陈迹
    吉林市是座美丽的古城。松花江好像一条蓝色的弧形飘带，环抱城区。郊外群山屹立，风景秀丽。它靠近广大的农村和山区，一直是药材、木材和农产品的集散地。因为木材供应方便，四、五十年前它的道路还是用木头铺成的。它的交通发达，素有水都之称。
    这座建城有将近三百年历史的古城，如今已不是以这些优越的自然条件著称了。它，已经变成了一座以化学工业为中心的重工业城市。在过去荒芜的旷野上，三大化工厂——吉林肥料厂、吉林染料厂和吉林电石厂以及为它们服务的吉林热电厂都先后建成了。它们建设时间不过三年，这三年就完全改变了吉林城的古老面貌。有人用“脖子长得比脑袋粗”这句话，来形容新工业区的发展。全部新工业区占地面积等于老市区占地面积的143％，新工业区建筑物的面积（包括厂房和职工住宅），也大大超过了老市区。几年前只有上千户人家散居着的荒野，今天已是十几万人居住的繁华区。全市工业总产值飞快增长，预计1957年工业总产值要比伪满时期最高一年（1943年）多三倍。
    吉林市原是一个发展化学工业最理想的地方。它有丰富的好水源和温度适当的好气温，有靠近的煤矿和石灰石矿，又有邻近的丰满水电站供应方便的电力。但是，多少年来，它都是一个消费城市。1658年（清顺治十五年），这里修了个原始的造船厂，那时开始建城。直到1928年，这里才有了一些榨油、制粉、火柴等小工厂。“九一八事变”以后，日本资本家看中了这个城市，同伪满傀儡政权组成所谓“满洲电气化学株式会社”，计划在这里修建化工厂，生产电石、焦炭和人造石油等。他们利用中国人民的血汗，花了六、七年时间，建成了一个小电石厂。这个小电石厂只有今天吉林电石厂一个车间大。至于人造石油，却始终没有炼出来。抗战胜利以后，国民党“劫收大员”来到这里，偷偷地把电石拿到街上去卖钱，后来索性拆机器，扒厂房，吞进私囊。解放前夕，这个城市已被破坏得不成样子。那个“满洲电气化学株式会社”遗留下来的破厂房，变成了猎人们捉野兔的歇脚场所。
    今天，三大化工厂把吉林市的这些好条件都充分利用起来了。松花江水源源流进吉林肥料厂，被分解成氢和氧，变成化学肥料和其他化学产品的组成部分。就是那种到处都有的空气，在这里也被用来作为重要的原料。很长时期，煤炭多是当做燃料被烧掉，现在三大化工厂用煤的副产品做出了许多种宝贵的东西。曾经在地下埋藏多年的石灰石，现在也被吉林电石厂用来制成用途极为广泛的电石。
    一眼看来，三大化工厂的外貌就同机械工厂不大一样。它们的厂房形式多样，有高有矮，有方有圆，有直立的也有倾斜的。直耸云霄的烟囱轻轻地吐出黄烟、白烟和青烟。高达六十三公尺的制造化学肥料的造粒塔，好像飘扬雪花似地把颗粒肥料送出来。一座座庞大的十几个人也围不拢的圆状大气柜，安静地躺在厂房附近。天空地底，厂房与厂房之间，到处都是纵横交错的五颜六色的管道，有的很粗，像是横摆在地上的大烟囱；有的较细，像是悬在空中的自来水管。管道最多的地方有七、八十条，上下重叠二十几层。管道的种类又很繁杂，有铜管，水泥管，塑料管，无缝钢管，不锈钢管等。它们的作用不同，有的能耐寒、耐热，有的能耐酸、耐压。吉林肥料厂有一种钢管，能够受得住三百二十大气压。这么大的压力，需要有一种特殊的钢管；否则，非要爆炸不可。吉林肥料厂还有一种管道，要忍受零下二百度的低温。普通的胶皮管要是遇着这样的低温，很快就会断裂。不少管道还要具有很强的耐酸能力。有人曾经不小心把吉林肥料厂生产的硝酸样品碰倒在水磨石上，马上把硝酸清除掉，水磨石已经被剥掉一层皮。生产这样的产品，没有耐酸能力很强的管道怎么行呢。
    三大化工厂都是规模巨大、技术先进的现代化工厂。它们的厂房结构很先进，高层的建筑比较多，二、三十公尺高的厂房占了一大半。重要的工艺设备多半是苏联供应的。它们的自动化程度很高，生产效能很大。许多设备都是用仪表控制的。光是吉林肥料厂的仪表就有一万多个。建设这样复杂的大型化工厂，在我国还是第一次。但是，建设三大化工厂的人们在党的领导下，在苏联专家的具体帮助下，不但提前几个月完成了建厂任务，而且提早完成了试车生产任务。吉林肥料厂正式投入生产以后，只要几个月就可以达到设计生产能力。现在，三大化工厂试车生产不久，产品的质量都是很好的。三大化工厂已经培养出大批现代化学工业的建设人才。他们将来能够以更快的速度，来建设更多的化工厂，支援农业生产。吉林肥料厂建设的时间不过两年半，将来用自制的设备和材料来建设这样规模的肥料厂，据估计只要一年半时间就可以了。
    平时人们想到化工厂，都要联想到安全的问题。因为化工厂生产中要跟有毒气体打交道，要碰上易于燃烧的氧气，又可能遇到种种意外事故。资本主义国家的化工厂，常常发生伤亡事故，甚至爆炸事故。苏联帮助我国设计的三大化工厂，却是很安全舒适的工厂。厂内所有生产设备和劳动保护设施，都能确保生产安全，卫护人身健康。凡是要同有毒气体打交道的生产过程，都尽量使用机器，不用人去操作。那些无用的有毒气体，也都用化学方法处理掉，排到人们呼吸不到的高空去。有些难闻的气味，也尽量清除出厂。厂内空气清新，温度适当，冬暖夏凉。各个生产厂房都有通风、保暖设备。吉林肥料厂安装好的通风机，就是一千多台。走进厂房，精神很愉快、舒畅。这是同资本主义国家的化工厂截然不同的。西德有些著名的化工厂，工人们只能在那里劳动三年，就不能继续工作；我们的三大化工厂却是个劳动愉快、工作安全的地方。当然要绝对不出一点儿事故，也不是不需要主观努力的。三大化工厂的职工们都懂得这一点，他们都把安全生产看成是头等重要的事情。
    三大化工厂的设计和设备这么好，建成的时间又这么快，主要是因为有了苏联无私的全面帮助。苏联许多单位和工厂帮助设计，供给最好的设备，还派出大批专家来具体指导工作。吉林肥料厂有个车间曾经因为缺少一台三联活塞泵，不能保证提前投入生产；苏联有个化工厂就赶快拆下自己备用的三联活塞泵，来帮助吉林肥料厂。在三大化工厂的许多苏联专家工作期满了，还自动要求多留在中国几天，帮助建设。三大化工厂的建成是中苏友谊的结晶，是我国化学工业发展史上新的一页。（附图片）
