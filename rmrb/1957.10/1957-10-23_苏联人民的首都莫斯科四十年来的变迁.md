    Forty Years of Changes in Moscow, the Capital of the Soviet People
    Moscow, a city known as the "city of calico" before the October Revolution, has transformed into a powerful industrial center of the country in the forty years since the revolution. During the Soviet era, Moscow's industrial output increased 57-fold, accounting for 8% of the country's total industrial output, equivalent to more than twice the total industrial output of Tsarist Russia in 1913.

    After the October Revolution, Moscow built factories that were famous throughout the country, such as the ball bearing factory, the light bulb factory, and the watch factory. Now, Moscow has more than 1,500 industrial enterprises, with more than one million industrial workers, engineers, and technicians. It holds a prominent position in the country in terms of automobile manufacturing, machine tool production, electrical technology, and textiles.

    Moscow is not only a powerful industrial fortress but also a huge scientific and cultural center. Currently, the city has hundreds of thousands of professors, lecturers, researchers, and university students, distributed among dozens of higher education institutions, academies of sciences, and research institutes, led by Moscow University. Specialized talents trained in Moscow are found all over the country, even in the most remote corners.

    Moscow has become a beautiful and prosperous new city in forty years. Its urban area has almost doubled compared to before the October Revolution, increasing from the original 18,000 hectares to the current 34,000 hectares. At present, Moscow builds new houses with an area of one to two million square meters every year. The new houses built after the October Revolution are many times more than the total number of houses built in Moscow during the hundreds of years of the Tsarist era. Districts like Zhdanov, Leningrad, and Southwest were almost entirely built in the last twenty or ten years. Now, more than half of the city's buildings are new.

    Moscow's streets have also been completely transformed. Okhtny Market Street in the city center, for example, was a place with small, low houses and small shops before the October Revolution. Now, famous buildings such as the "Moscow" Hotel and the Council of Ministers Building have been built there. Gorky Street, near the city center, was widened from 16.5 meters to 50 meters after the October Revolution. Many streets that were once narrow, winding, and crowded have been rebuilt into wide roads, with poetic boulevards and street gardens. All the streets in the city are paved with asphalt and cement, and if they were connected, they would be 1,500 kilometers long, equal to the distance from Moscow to Warsaw. Before the October Revolution, the city had only 193 street lights, and it was dark everywhere. Now, Moscow is brightly lit at night, as bright as day. The subway, the city's public bus lines with a total length of 2,300 kilometers, and the trolleybus lines are all newly built after the October Revolution. They are well-connected in all directions, transporting 9 million passengers every day and night.

    In Moscow, it is impossible to find the slums that are commonplace in the big cities of capitalist countries. Before 1917, 72% of the houses in Moscow were built of wood, and 70% of the residents lived in basements or attics. Now, beautiful and symmetrical building complexes built of brick and stone are distributed in all directions of the city, and the vast majority of residents live in modern houses.

    The improvement of people's lives is the biggest change among all the changes in Moscow. After a stage of diligent construction, those hard days before the revolution are gone forever, but they remain in the memory of the people. In that period, a worker could only earn 47 kopecks a day, while it took one ruble to maintain the minimum standard of living. Now, the income of the workers is enough to support their families and live a comfortable life.

    Moiseyev, an old worker who has worked in the "Three Mountains" textile factory for more than 40 years, recalled that in the past, the workers of the "Three Mountains" textile factory lived in dark, dirty, and crowded collective dormitories. Because there were no houses to live in, workers had to hang up curtains in a corner of the collective dormitory as a bridal chamber when they got married. Now, the workers of the "Three Mountains" textile factory live in bright and spacious residential buildings.

    苏联人民的首都莫斯科四十年来的变迁
    莫斯科，这座在十月革命前被称为“印花布的城市”，在革命后的四十年期间已经变成了全国强大的工业中心。在苏维埃政权年代，莫斯科的工业产量增加了五十七倍，占全国工业总产量的8％，相当于1913年沙皇俄国全国工业总产量的两倍多。
    十月革命后，莫斯科新建了像滚珠轴承制造厂、灯泡厂、制表厂等闻名全国的工厂。现在，全莫斯科已经拥有一千五百多个工业企业，一百多万产业工人和工程技术人员。它在汽车制造、机床生产、电力技术和纺织方面在全国居显著地位。
    莫斯科不仅是一个强大的工业堡垒，而且也是一个巨大的科学文化中心。目前这个城市拥有数十万名教授、讲师、研究员、大学生，他们分布在以莫斯科大学为首的好几十个高等学府、科学院和研究所中。全国各地，那怕是最偏僻的角落都有莫斯科培养出来的专门人才。
    莫斯科在四十年间变成了一座美丽繁荣的新型城市。它的城区几乎比十月革命前扩大了一倍，面积已经从原来的一万八千公顷增加到现在的三万四千公顷。目前，莫斯科每年都要建筑面积达一百几十万平方公尺的新房屋，十月革命后增建的新房子比沙皇时代莫斯科几百年间修建的房屋的总和还要多好几倍。像日丹诺夫区、列宁格勒区、西南区几乎全是最近二十年内或是最近十年内建设起来的。现在，全市的建筑物有一半以上是新的。
    莫斯科的街道也完全改观。像市中心的奥赫特内市场街，十月革命前本是房屋矮小、小店铺林立的地方。现在，那里建造了“莫斯科”大旅馆、部长会议大厦等著名建筑物。靠近市中心的高尔基大街，十月革命后从十六·五公尺加宽到五十公尺。许多过去曾经是狭窄、弯曲、拥挤的街道，都被改建成宽大的马路，开辟出充满诗情画意的林荫路和街心花园。在全市的街道都铺上沥青洋灰的路面，如果把它们接连起来就有一千五百公里长，等于莫斯科到华沙的距离。十月革命前，全市只有一百九十三盏路灯，到处昏黑不明，现在莫斯科入夜时，处处灯火辉煌，照耀得如同白昼。地下铁道、长达两千三百公里的市内公共汽车线路、无轨电车路完全是十月革命后新建的，它们四通八达，每昼夜运送乘客达九百万人次。
    在莫斯科，根本找不到资本主义国家大城市中司空见惯的贫民窟。在1917年以前，莫斯科有72％的房屋是用木头建造的，70％的居民住在地下室或者顶楼上。现在，砖石建造的美丽匀称的建筑群分布在城市的四面八方，绝大部分居民住在现代化的住宅里。
    人民生活的改善是莫斯科所有变化当中最大的变化。经过了勤俭建设的阶段以后，革命前的那些苦难的日子一去不复返了，可也永远地留在人民的记忆里。那时期，一个工人每天只能赚得四十七戈比，而为了维持最低限度的生活却需要一卢布。现在工人们的收入足可养活家小和过充裕的生活。
    在“三山”纺织厂工作了四十多年的老工人莫伊谢也夫回忆说，过去“三山”纺织厂的工人住在黝黑、空气污浊、挤满了人的集体宿舍里。因为没有房子住，工人结婚时不得不在集体宿舍的一角挂起布幔，充作新房。现在，“三山”纺织厂的工人们都住在明亮宽敞的住宅大楼里。
