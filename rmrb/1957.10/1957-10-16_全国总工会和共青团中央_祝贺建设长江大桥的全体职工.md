　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League
　　Congratulate All Workers Building the Yangtze River Bridge

　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Before the completion and opening of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions wrote a letter to all workers of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, expressing deep sympathy and warm congratulations, and expressing sincere respect and gratitude to the Soviet experts who helped build the bridge.

　　The congratulatory letter said that the fact that Chinese workers were able to build this huge and technically complex Yangtze River Bridge at an astonishing speed fully reflects that under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese working class has infinite wisdom and great strength. The congratulatory letter hopes that the workers will guard against arrogance and impetuosity, summarize and learn from the various experiences of this bridge construction, and continuously improve their technical level and political and ideological level to meet new construction tasks.

　　The congratulatory letter said that the Yangtze River Bridge embodies the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and vividly demonstrates the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the spirit of hard work and thrift in building the country of the Soviet people will always be a model for the Chinese working class to learn from. We must continue to work hard to consolidate and develop the unbreakable great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China sent a congratulatory letter to the Committee of the Communist Youth League of Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau and all the workers of the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau on the 14th, saying: We warmly congratulate you on realizing the long-cherished wish of the Chinese people to build the Yangtze River Bridge, and completing the great task of turning the Yangtze River into a thoroughfare.

　　We warmly congratulate you on completing this unprecedentedly complex project in our country in an extremely short period of time, shattering the various fallacies of the Rightists who oppose the Communist Party, oppose socialism, and obliterate the great achievements of socialist construction.

　　We warmly congratulate you on successfully learning from the advanced bridge-building experience of Soviet experts, and with greater enthusiasm and higher confidence, making more heroic advances toward the new task before you—building more bridges on the Yellow River and the Yangtze River.
