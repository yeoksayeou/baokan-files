The Tianjin Fourth Middle School is no longer an unfamiliar name in many secondary schools in the Soviet Union. In the summer of 1954, students from this school, selected for their excellent academic performance and a certain foundation in Russian, organized a "Friendship Society" and maintained close ties with students from more than twenty schools in the Soviet Union, including Leningrad Fourth Middle School, Kazakhstan Lenin Middle School, and Moscow No. 597 Middle School. Friendly communication has become an important part of their lives. They correspond almost every week, learning from and helping each other. (Attached picture)

　　鸿雁往返情谊深
    天津市第四中学在苏联很多中等学校里已经不是一个陌生的名字。这个学校的学生们，在1954年暑期，由功课优秀、有一定俄文基础的学生组织了一个“友谊社”，和苏联的列宁格勒第四中学、哈萨克斯坦列宁中学和莫斯科第597中学等二十多个学校的学生们保持着亲密的联系。友谊的通讯，已经成为他们生活中重要内容。他们几乎每个星期都有书信往来，互相学习、互相帮助。（附图片）
　　为了庆贺十月革命四十周年，友谊社的同学们送给苏联哈萨克斯坦列宁中学学生一些礼物。他们正在装箱。
　　在今年我国国庆节当天，学生们收到了哈萨克斯坦列宁中学学生发来的贺电。
