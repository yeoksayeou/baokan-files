Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: After a vigorous streamlining of its management organization, the state-owned Beijing Southern Suburb Farm has seen significant progress in its operation and management during the first month.

Now, there are only a few staff members working in the offices of the general farm headquarters and various branch farm headquarters, but their work efficiency has improved compared to before. For example, the accounting statements reported in September were submitted more than twenty days earlier than the same period last year. In the past, the farm director and branch farm directors were busy all day with administrative affairs, meetings, reviewing and approving documents, and resolving cadres' ideological problems; now, with the streamlining of the organization and the transfer of cadres to participate in production, these problems have relatively decreased. They can now spend half a day every day going to the fields and livestock farms to inspect work or participate in labor, so they have a more concrete understanding of various problems in production than in the past, and they can handle them more quickly. Some problems are solved on the spot. All the transferred cadres are happily working with the workers.

Why has this farm's work efficiency not decreased but increased, and its leadership over production not weakened but strengthened, after streamlining a large number of management personnel? According to the farm director, the main reasons are: in the past, the farm's management organization was bureaucratic, with too many management personnel; the leading cadres did not have a clear understanding of the workload of each management department or how many people were needed; and there were many problems that the higher-ups did not understand, and the lower-downs had opinions about. He said that the work of streamlining the management organization this time involved studying how much manpower was needed for each task and mobilizing and tapping the work potential of the staff responsible for each specific task. For example, the former chief of the finance section of the general headquarters was solely responsible for planning in the past; after the streamlining, he was also responsible for warehousing, material allocation, disbursement, and piece-rate wages, which used to require three people to do, and he is still very competent. This proves that reducing the number of finance cadres from five to three is not only completely reasonable but also ensures that the work can be done well. Another example is that the four agricultural statisticians in the whole farm used to be full-time; now they have been transferred to participate in production, and they only spend two hours a day part-time on this work, which they also complete very well. Other technicians, such as agricultural and animal husbandry technicians, can spend two-thirds of their time participating in labor production each month. Their experience proves that only by participating in labor production can technical personnel better guide production. As for personnel, security, and other administrative management personnel, they can also fully participate in labor production while taking time to manage their professional work.

In addition, strengthening the planning of production leadership and making specific arrangements for various tasks are also key issues that have ensured that the farm's management work and production leadership have not been affected after the streamlining of the organization.

The cadres who have been transferred after the streamlining of the organization have not only made great progress in labor training in production practice, but also greatly increased their production knowledge in various aspects. Some staff members who have always done secretarial and financial work now have a preliminary understanding of how to cultivate tomatoes in greenhouses and experience in artificially cultivating mushrooms indoors. Some agricultural technicians used to only do light physical labor, but now they can carry things from dozens of pounds to one hundred and twenty pounds. Some cadres have also become healthier and stronger in their bodies during labor, and their weight has increased by two or three kilograms.

The streamlining of the farm's management organization not only greatly reduces the farm's management costs, but also creates a large amount of wealth for the country. According to preliminary calculations by the farm, if the labor of the cadres participating in production is equivalent to 70% of that of agricultural workers, then each person will create an average of 867 yuan more labor value for the country each year than in the past. A total of seventy-three cadres have been transferred to participate in production throughout the farm. Excluding the necessary professional work time of agricultural, animal husbandry, and other technical personnel, if sixty people participate in labor production throughout the year, they will create more than 50,000 yuan of wealth for the country in one year.

### 北京南郊农场  紧缩机构后气象一新  工作效率提高　下放干部愉快劳动

    北京南郊农场
    紧缩机构后气象一新
    工作效率提高　下放干部愉快劳动
    据新华社6日讯　地方国营北京南郊农场在大力紧缩管理机构后的第一个月，农场的经营管理工作已有显著的进步。
    现在，农场总场部和各个分场部的办公室里，只有很少的人员在工作，但是他们工作的效率比以前提高了。例如九月份上报的会计报表，比去年同期提早了二十多天。场长和分场长过去成天忙于行政事务、会议、批审文件和解决干部的思想问题；现在随着机构紧缩和干部下放参加生产，这些问题相对地减少了。他们每天能够抽出半天时间到田间和畜牧场去检查工作或参加劳动，因此对生产中各种问题比过去了解得更具体，处理得也更迅速，有些问题在现场就解决了。所有下放的干部和工人在一起愉快地劳动着。
    这个农场为什么在紧缩大批管理人员以后，工作的效率不是降低而是提高，对生产的领导不是削弱而是加强呢？据这个农场的场长说，主要的原因是：过去农场管理机构机关化，管理人员过多；领导干部对每个管理部门的工作量到底有多少、需要多少人是不摸底的；有许多问题，上面不了解，下面有意见。他说，这次紧缩管理机构的工作就是研究了每项工作需要多少人力，并且动员和挖掘了担任各项具体工作人员的工作潜力。如前总场部的财务科长，过去单搞计划；紧缩以后，他兼管了计划、保管、物资调拨、出纳和计件工资等过去需要三个人做的工作，并且还很胜任。这证明财务干部从五个紧缩到三个，不但完全合理，同时也能把工作做好。又如全场四个农业统计员，过去是专职的，现在下放参加生产，每天只用两个小时兼管这项工作，也完成得很好。其他像农业、畜牧技术员，每个月都可以用三分之二的时间参加劳动生产。他们的经验证明：技术人员只有参加劳动生产，才能更好地指导生产。至于人事、保卫和其他行政管理人员，也完全可以参加劳动生产，同时抽出时间兼管他们的业务工作。
    此外加强对生产领导的计划性、对各种工作进行具体安排，也是农场机构紧缩以后管理工作和生产领导没有受到影响的一个关键问题。
    紧缩机构后下放的干部在生产实践中，不仅在劳动锻炼上有很大进步，同时各方面的生产知识也有很大增进。有些一向做秘书和财务工作的人员，现在初步懂得了在温室中如何培育西红柿的知识和在室内用人工培植蘑菇的经验。有些农业技术人员过去只作过轻体力劳动，但现在挑东西已从几十斤增加到一百二十斤。有些干部在劳动中身体也更健壮了，体重增加了两三公斤。
    农场管理机构紧缩以后，不仅使农场的管理费用大大减少，同时还将为国家创造大量财富。据这个农场初步计算，如果参加生产的干部的劳动量相当于农业工人的70％，那末每人每年平均就比过去多为国家创造八百六十七元的劳动价值。全场下放参加生产的干部共七十三人，除去农业、畜牧业等技术人员必要的业务工作时间，按六十人全年参加劳动生产计算，他们在一年之内就为国家多创造五万多元财富。
