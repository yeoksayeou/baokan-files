    With the help of Soviet experts
    By our reporters Yu Ming and Yu Feng
    Recently, we visited the Huainan Coal Mine. The chief engineer of the coal mine, Li Qifeng, happily told us that in the Second Five-Year Plan, Huainan Coal Mine can increase its annual output from the current 4.7 million tons to about 10 million tons by basically using existing equipment with slight renovations and new construction, more than doubling the current production level. We were very surprised to hear this. Because Huainan Coal Mine is now one of the five major coal mines in China, wouldn't this be equivalent to adding a new large coal mine during the Second Five-Year Plan period without much additional investment? We asked engineer Li Qifeng how this was possible, and he began to talk about the arrival of Soviet experts Khalchenko and Leonenko in Huainan.
    In July of this year, Soviet experts Khalchenko and Leonenko came to Huainan. When they visited several mines in Huainan, they asked engineer Li Qifeng about the possibility of increasing production at Huainan Coal Mine during the Second Five-Year Plan. Li Qifeng said that Huainan Coal Mine could produce 7 million tons annually by 1962 using existing equipment, exceeding the actual output of the current mines by more than 2 million tons. The experts said that it was very good that you could think of ways to increase production! However, after the experts visited each mine, they questioned these figures. When the experts visited the No. 2 mine in Xiejiachi, Li Qifeng told the experts that this mine could produce 4,000 tons of coal per day in 1962, increasing from the current annual output of 900,000 tons to 1.2 million tons, exceeding the designed production capacity by one-third. After carefully observing and analyzing the mine's equipment and reserves, the expert stopped at the mine entrance and said that according to the mine's conditions, the annual output of this mine should not be 1.2 million tons, but 1.75 million tons. According to the equipment capacity of this mine, with a slight renovation, it can produce 5,000 tons per day, and if calculated on the basis of 350 production days per year instead of 300 days, reaching this figure is not difficult. When they arrived at the Xinzhuangzi Coal Mine, Li Qifeng said that after some renovations, the mine planned to increase from the current annual output of 1.2 million tons to 1.8 million tons by 1962. After analyzing, the Soviet experts believed that it could produce 2.75 million tons annually. With the help of Soviet experts in calculating the accounts and tapping potential in this way, the goal of achieving 7 million tons of output during the Second Five-Year Plan was raised to 10 million tons.
    Speaking of this, we asked Li Qifeng why the original goal and the goal proposed by the experts differed so greatly. Li Qifeng said with a smile that, in the final analysis, it was still a matter of understanding and thinking about building the country through diligence and thrift. He said that in the past, they subjectively wanted to tap production potential, but it was not clear to what extent. The Soviet experts enlightened them, which is to take meeting the needs of the country as much as possible as the standard. Li Qifeng said that in the past, they rarely considered the problem from this perspective. They only considered how the mine could complete the state plan and have a certain amount of increased production. Because the angles of consideration were different, there were differences in the degree of tapping production potential.
    Finally, Li Qifeng and Zheng Chuntian, deputy secretary of the Huainan Mining Committee of the Communist Party of China, who was sitting next to him, both said that with the help of Soviet experts, not only will the output be more than doubled during the Second Five-Year Plan period, but more importantly, this matter has had an ideological impact on the engineering and technical personnel, and everyone has a new understanding of how to actively implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift. Now, the mine's engineering personnel are full of confidence in achieving the goal of 10 million tons in 1962!
    At the Datong Coal Mine in Huainan, we heard a second story. In the engineer's office of the coal mine, engineer Dai Zhuofu opened the Datong mine underground map for us to see. This map showed that most of the underground coal in Datong Mine had been mined, but there were still many blank areas that had not been marked. Engineer Dai said that there were even more blank areas on this map before 1953, and at that time, the blank area above 330 meters was no longer planned to be mined. But why was it mined later? This is thanks to the help of Soviet expert Yuri Lev.
    In 1953, when Soviet expert Yuri Lev came to Huainan, the person in charge and engineering and technical personnel of Datong Mine told him that the coal in Datong Mine would be mined out in a few years, and now it was necessary to quickly extend to the deep part below 330 meters. Yuri Lev saw that the equipment of Datong Mine was better than that of ordinary mines, and he thought, what a pity if such equipment is not well utilized! Therefore, he was not thinking about extending to the deep part, but about how to use the existing potential. Yuri Lev asked to see the underground map of Datong Mine. When he unfolded the map, he discovered a major problem. It turned out that there were large blank areas on the map, and it was not known whether they had been mined or not, and whether there was coal or not. So Yuri Lev asked the engineers:
      "Why aren't these blank areas mined?"
      "They were mined in the past!" some engineers said.
      "There is no coal in this place!" others said.
      "What is the basis for your saying that?" Yuri Lev asked again, and everyone was silent. Because no one had any definite basis.
    Originally, Datong Mine was an old mine. During the enemy and puppet regime, coal mining was carried out in a disorderly manner. Wherever it was easy to mine, they mined it, and as a result, a lot of coal was lost. After liberation, our engineering and technical personnel did not conduct investigations and research on the past mining situation. Although they saw many blank areas, they did not have any doubts, and thought that there was no coal. Their thinking was only about extending downwards and mining in the new area. In 1953, our engineering and technical personnel estimated that there were only more than 2.2 million tons of reserves from the ground to 330 meters, which could be mined out in just over two years. The reserves below were unclear, so it was believed that this mine would be scrapped in a few years. Seeing this situation, Soviet expert Yuri Lev said to our engineering personnel: "In our daily life, even if a person's shoes are broken, they have to be mended before wearing them again. They are not thrown away as soon as they are broken, let alone a mine, how can it be easily scrapped?" "You are the custodians of the country's underground warehouse. How can custodians manage the warehouse well if they don't know how much is in the warehouse?" He said that according to scientific reasoning, it is impossible for there to be coal in the lower part and no coal in the upper part. Therefore, there must be many places with coal in the blank areas on the map. He suggested that Datong Mine establish a geological organization to clarify the geological conditions and coal reserves under the mine. He said that now the main thing is to mine the coal above the existing level, and there is no need to rush to renovate the mine, extend it downwards, and waste state funds.
    Engineer Dai of Datong Coal Mine pointed to the underground map of the coal mine and said that many areas were considered to have no coal in 1953, but after implementing the Soviet expert's suggestion in the second half of 1953, coal was found again and re-mined. He said that from 1953 to now, hundreds of thousands of tons of coal have been found in the blank areas every year. By implementing the expert's suggestions, a large amount of discarded coal was found, maintaining an output of 750,000 tons every year. After mining for several years, there were still 2.2 million tons of reserves above 330 meters in 1959. This postponed the state's investment in renovating the mine by a full four years (originally planned to renovate in 1953, but actually only started this year). Engineer Dai said: "Cherishing every bit of the country's wealth, striving to ensure that the country does not invest, invests less, or invests later, and produces more coal for the country, this is the method of building the country through diligence and thrift that Yuri Lev taught us." He said: "We are now the true masters of the country's underground warehouse."
    Finally, engineer Dai said with deep emotion: "Yuri Lev's criticism of us was strict, but this criticism contained infinite love. Usually, it is not easy to remember foreigners' names, but we do not feel unfamiliar with Yuri Lev's name at all. We will always remember him!"

    在苏联专家的帮助下
    本报记者　于明　于风
    最近，我们到淮南煤矿去访问。煤矿的总工程师李栖凤高兴地告诉我们，淮南煤矿在第二个五年计划中，基本利用现有设备，略加改建和新建，就可能从现在四百七十万吨的年产量提高到一千万吨左右，即超过现在的生产水平一倍以上。我们听了感到很惊讶。因为淮南煤矿现在是我国五大煤矿之一，这样一来，不就等于在第二个五年计划期间，不增加多少投资，就新增加了一个大煤矿吗？我们问李栖凤工程师，怎么有这样可能，他就谈起了苏联专家哈尔钦柯和列奥年柯来淮南的事情。
    今年7月，苏联专家哈尔钦柯和列奥年柯来到淮南，他们参观淮南的几个矿井时，便问到李栖凤工程师，淮南煤矿在第二个五年计划中增产的可能性。李栖凤说，淮南煤矿利用现有设备在1962年将可年产七百万吨，超过现在矿井实际产量二百多万吨。专家说，你们能够想办法多增产，这很好！但是，在专家参观了各个矿井以后，却对这样的数字提出了怀疑。当专家参观谢家集二号矿井时，李栖凤告诉专家，这一矿井在1962年将可日产四千吨煤，将由现在的年产九十万吨提高到一百二十万吨，超过设计生产能力三分之一。专家仔细观察和分析了矿井的设备和埋藏量时，在井口站住了，他说根据矿井条件，这个矿的年产量不应该是一百二十万吨，而是一百七十五万吨。按这个矿井的设备能力，稍加改造每天可以出到五千吨，一年不以三百天生产日计算，而以三百五十天计算，达到这个数字是不困难的。到了新庄孜煤矿时，李栖凤说，这个矿打算在进行部分改建后，1962年由现在的年产一百二十万吨提高到一百八十万吨，苏联专家分析后，却认为可年产二百七十五万吨。经过苏联专家帮助这样算细账、挖潜力，把第二个五年计划期间达到七百万吨产量的目标，提高到了一千万吨。
    谈到这里，我们便问李栖凤，为什么原来的目标，和专家提出的目标，相差这样大呢？李栖凤笑着说，说来说去还是个对勤俭建国的认识问题，也是个思想问题。他说，过去他们在主观上也是想法挖掘生产潜力的，但是挖到什么程度却不明确。苏联专家启发了他们，这就是要以尽量满足国家需要为标准。李栖凤说，过去他们是很少从这样的角度考虑问题的。只考虑本矿如何能够完成国家计划，能有一定数量的增产就行了。因为考虑的角度不同，所以在挖掘生产潜力的程度上就有了差别。
    最后，李栖凤和坐在旁边的中共淮南矿委副书记郑春田都说，经过苏联专家帮助，在第二个五年计划期间不仅增加产量一倍以上，更为重要的是这件事对工程技术人员的思想影响，大家对于如何积极贯彻勤俭建国方针有了新的体会。现在，全矿工程人员对1962年达到一千万吨的目标充满信心！
    在淮南大通煤矿，我们听到了第二件事情。在煤矿的工程师室里，戴卓夫工程师打开大通矿井下图纸给我们看。这张图上表明大通矿的地下煤，已大部分被开采了，但是还有不少空白的地方没有划上任何记号。戴工程师说，这张图在1953年以前空白的地方更多，那时对三百三十米以上的空白区已准备不再开采了。但是后来为什么又开采起来呢？这要归功于苏联专家尤里列夫的帮助。
    1953年，苏联专家尤里列夫来到淮南时，大通矿上的负责人和工程技术人员都告诉他说，大通矿的煤再有几年就要采完了，现在需要很快向三百三十米以下的深部延伸。尤里列夫看到大通矿的设备比一般矿井的设备都好，他想，这样的设备不能很好利用，多么可惜！因此，他想的不是向深部延伸，而是想着如何利用现有潜力。尤里列夫要求看一看大通矿的井下图纸。他把图纸一展开，便发现了一个重大问题。原来图纸上有大片大片的空白区，不知是采过了还是没有采过，不知道有煤还是没有煤。于是尤里列夫便问工程师：
      “这些空白区为什么不采？”
      “过去采过了！”有的工程师说。
      “这地方没有煤！”又有的说。
      “你们这样说有什么根据？”尤里列夫又这样一问，大家都不说话了。因为谁也没有确实根据。
    原来，大通矿是一个老矿，在敌伪时，采煤都是乱采乱掘，那块好采便采那块，结果丢掉的煤很多。解放后，我们的工程技术人员没有对过去采掘的情况进行调查研究，虽然看到有很多空白区，也没有发生过怀疑，认为是没有煤了，思想上只是想着向下延伸，在新区采掘。1953年我们的工程技术人员估计从地面到三百三十米处还只有二百二十多万吨埋藏量，只要两年多就可采完，再往下的埋藏量则搞不清，所以认为这个矿井不过几年就要报废了。苏联专家尤里列夫看到这种情况，便对我们的工程人员说：“在我们日常生活中，个人的鞋子破了也要补一下再穿，没有一破即扔掉的，又何况一个矿井，那能轻易报废？”“你们是国家地下仓库的管家人，管家人不知道仓库里有多少东西，怎么能够管好仓库？”他说，根据科学的推论，不可能在下部有煤，而上部反而无煤，所以图上的空白区中，肯定有很多地方是有煤的。他建议大通矿建立地质机构，把矿井下的地质情况，煤的埋藏量确实弄清楚。他说，现在主要应该采掘现有水平以上的煤，不应该急于改建矿井，向下延伸，浪费国家资金。
    大通煤矿的戴工程师，指着煤矿的井下图说，很多块都是在1953年已经认为无煤，而在1953年下半年执行苏联专家建议以后，又重新找到了煤再回采的。他说，从1953年起到现在，每年都在空白区找到几十万吨的煤。执行专家建议，找到了大量丢弃的煤，每年保持了七十五万吨的产量，采了几年，到1959年在三百三十米以上仍可保持有二百二十万吨的埋藏量。使国家改建矿井的投资整整推迟了四年（原来计划1953年改建，实际今年才开始）。戴工程师说：“爱惜国家一点一滴的财富，尽力争取国家不投资，少投资，或迟投资，为国家多生产煤炭，这就是尤里列夫告诉我们的勤俭建国的方法”。他说：“我们现在才是国家地下仓库的真正主人了。”
    最后，戴工程师以深厚的感情说：“尤里列夫对我们批评是严格的，但是这个批评里包含着无限的热爱，平常感到外国人的名字不容易记，而对尤里列夫的名字，却一点也不感到生疏，我们永远记着他！”
