Shanghai, from our newspaper: The Party organizations in factories, enterprises, and government offices in Shanghai that are carrying out the Rectification Movement have adopted various methods to improve their work in implementing the Rectification policy of "rectification and reform simultaneously," making the Rectification Movement more lively, vivid, and rich in content.

Many units in Shanghai have established specialized work improvement organizations to lead this effort. The Shanghai University of Finance and Economics formed seven specialized groups focusing on system and leadership, wages and benefits, personnel arrangements, teaching, and scientific research, to study over 3,000 suggestions made by teachers, students, and staff. Factories such as State Cotton Mill No. 1 also designated a factory director or deputy director to lead this work.

In the process of "rectification and reform simultaneously," many units have first adopted the policy of "doing what can be done immediately" in order to improve work in the short term and further enhance the confidence of the masses in the Rectification Movement. State Cotton Mill No. 1, Shanghai Shipyard, Shanghai Boiler Factory, Shanghai Steel Plants Nos. 2 and 3, and others have all addressed hundreds of problems in a short period, some improving production equipment, others improving working conditions and welfare benefits. The specialized groups at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics studied more than 700 suggestions made by the masses, and more than 100 of them, which could be implemented immediately, were done so. For example, more than 20 young teachers suggested: those who originally studied political economy were asked to teach political and economic geography; those who originally studied accounting were asked to teach credit, etc. After their suggestions were made, their work was immediately adjusted.

In order to place the work of improvement under the supervision of the masses and to facilitate the absorption of their opinions, many factories and schools in Shanghai have established specialized big-character posters to reflect "rectification and reform simultaneously," reporting the progress and plans of improvement work to the masses in a timely manner and soliciting their opinions. State Cotton Mill No. 1, Shanghai Shipyard, Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, and Shanghai Normal College No. 1 all have such big-character posters. In the improvement work column of the Shanghai Shipyard, workers go there every day to inquire about new developments, and when new measures are published, they happily tell each other. The problem of the ferry across the river for the factory had not been resolved for a long time, and two thousand workers had to travel three or four stops more every day to get to and from work, and the workers had many complaints. When the big-character poster reported that this problem had been resolved by the factory director himself after consulting with the Port Authority, everyone was extremely happy.

In the process of improvement, some units organize worker representatives to participate together, laying out the problems face-to-face and discussing them together. After the workers of the Shanghai Jingye Machine Factory made more than 1,000 suggestions, the factory leaders studied and processed them one by one with the worker representatives, and those that were correct and could be done were done immediately. For example, the workers suggested that the production plan arrangement and material supply were not timely, that there was no transportation for night shift workers to go home, and that there were temporary accommodation problems for family members of workers who came to Shanghai for visits. Everyone agreed that these opinions were correct and were resolved immediately. Some workers requested the restoration of old welfare systems such as food subsidies, transportation costs, and bathing fees. After studying the matter, the factory disagreed with the restoration and submitted it to the worker representatives for discussion. After discussion, everyone agreed that the cancellation was correct, because the old system was disorganized and diverse when the factory was first merged, which would not only cause difficulties for the leadership but also create disunity and disputes among the workers, and would also affect fraternal factories. Once the reasons were made clear, no one raised the issue again.

In the midst of the Rectification Movement, units in Shanghai often encounter problems that have a significant impact on the progress of the movement. These problems have a great influence on the masses and are therefore not suitable for general handling. Therefore, each unit organizes a special investigation team, with the participation of worker representatives, to conduct special investigations. For example, when making suggestions at the Jingye Machine Factory, someone suggested that "cadre Party members receive more hardship subsidies, while the masses receive less." After the suggestion was made, the masses discussed it a lot, and it was necessary to find out the truth in time, so the factory organized an investigation team to conduct an investigation. The investigation results showed that in a year and a half, a total of 89 households were subsidized, of which only 8 were cadres and Party members, with an average of 15 yuan per household, and the rest were the masses, with an average of more than 31 yuan per household. The masses were very satisfied after the inspection report was published.

Some cadres who have been correctly criticized by the masses also promptly express their attitude to the masses and accept their criticism. Some Party member cadres at State Cotton Mill No. 1 wrote big-character posters to express their attitude, and some made public self-criticisms to the masses at group meetings. Cadres in some factories quickly took practical actions to correct their shortcomings. For example, the workers of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2 criticized Xu Binggen, the chief of the labor and wages section, for not going deep into his work. Xu Binggen recently went deep into various departments to discuss matters with everyone when studying the labor organization. In this way, the connection between these criticized cadres and the workers was quickly restored or enhanced.

    采取多种办法边整边改
    上海整风运动生动活泼内容丰富
    本报上海电　上海开展整风运动的工厂企业和机关的党组织，在贯彻执行“边整边改”的整风方针中，采取了多种多样改进工作的方法，整风运动更加生动活泼，内容丰富。
    上海许多单位大都成立了改进工作的专业机构，领导这方面的工作。上海财经学院组成了体制与领导、工资福利、人事安排、教学、科学研究等七个专门小组，逐条地研究全校师生员工们提出的三千多条意见。国棉一厂等工厂，也都指定一位厂长或副厂长，领导这一工作。
    许多单位在“边整边改”中，首先采取了“可办的立即就动手办”的方针，以便在短期内就能改进工作，使群众对整风的信心更加增强。国棉一厂，上海船厂，上海锅炉厂，上海钢铁二厂、三厂等，在短期内都处理了几百个问题，有的改进了生产设备，有的改善了劳动条件和生活福利问题。上海财经学院的专门小组研究了群众提出的七百多条意见，其中有一百多条属于可以立即办到的，就一一办到了。譬如，有二十多位青年教师提出：原来学政治经济学的，叫他教政治经济地理；原来学会计的，教信贷，等等。他们的意见提出后，马上就调整了工作。
    为了把改进工作置于群众的监督之下，并且便于吸收群众的意见，上海不少工厂和学校都建立了专门反映“边整边改”的大字报，及时向群众报道改进工作的情况、计划，征询大家的意见。上海国棉一厂、上海船厂、上海电机厂、上海第一师范学院都有这种大字报。在上海船厂改进工作专栏里，工人们每天都到那里去打听一下有什么新的消息，当新的措施刊出后，他们便欣喜地互相传告。这个厂的对江轮渡问题，长期未解决，有二千多工人每天上下班要多跑三、四站路，工人意见很多。当大字报上报道说：这个问题已由厂长亲自到港务局商量后解决，大家都高兴极了。
    有些单位在改进工作中，组织职工代表一起参加，面对面地把问题摊开来，一件件地商量着共同来办。上海精业机器厂的职工在提了一千多条意见之后，厂的领导同志就和职工代表一起逐条研究处理，意见正确、能办得到的就马上做。如职工提出生产计划安排和材料供应不及时，夜班工人回家没有交通车，工人家属来上海探视的临时住宿问题等，大家认为这些意见都是正确的，就马上解决了。有些职工要求恢复伙食补贴、车费、洗澡费等旧有福利制度，厂里研究后不同意恢复，就把它交给职工代表讨论，经过讨论，大家认为取消是对的，因刚合并厂时，旧制度杂乱、多样，执行起来不仅领导方面有困难，在职工中也会造成不团结和纠纷，还会影响兄弟厂。道理讲清了，大家也就不再提它了。
    上海各单位在整风中间常常遇到一些对运动的进展有很大影响的问题，这些问题在群众中的影响很大，因此不宜作一般的处理，各单位就组织专门调查小组，吸收职工代表参加，进行专案调查。例如精业机器厂在提意见时有人提出：“干部党员困难补助费多批，群众补助费少批。”意见提出后群众议论纷纷，需要及时查明真相，厂里便组织调查小组进行调查。调查结果是，在一年半的时间内，共补助了八十九户，其中干部、党员只有八户，平均每户十五元，其余补助的都是群众，平均每户三十一元多。检查报告公布后，群众都很满意。
    一些受到群众正确批评的干部，也及时地向群众表明态度，接受群众的批评。上海国棉一厂有些党员干部写大字报表明态度，有的在小组会上向群众公开检讨。有的厂的干部就迅速以实际行动来改正自己的缺点。例如上钢二厂的工人批评了劳动工资科长徐炳根工作不深入，徐炳根最近在研究劳动组织时，就深入各部门去和大家商量着办。这样，这些被批评的干部和工人的联系，很快就恢复或增进了。
