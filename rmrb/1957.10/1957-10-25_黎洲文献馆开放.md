    Opening of the Lizhou Literature House
    The "Lizhou Literature Memorial Hall" in Yuyao, established to commemorate Huang Zongxi, a hero of the late Ming Dynasty against the Qing and an enlightenment thinker of 17th century China, has recently opened to the public on a regular basis.

    The "Lizhou Literature Memorial Hall" stands on Longquan Mountain, a famous scenic spot in Yuyao City, and was built on the site where Wang Shouren, another great thinker of the Ming Dynasty, lectured. In addition to preserving objects and works related to Huang Zongxi, Wang Shouren, Zhu Shunshui, and Yan Ziling, the memorial hall also houses a large number of important books and cultural relics from the eastern Zhejiang region. These include relics from the Neolithic Age and revolutionary documents from the Great Revolution period. (Yu Renjie)

    黎洲文献馆开放
    为纪念明末抗清英雄，我国十七世纪启蒙思想家黄宗羲而设立的余姚“黎洲文献纪念馆”最近开始定期开放。
      “黎洲文献纪念馆”屹立在余姚城中著名的风景区龙泉山上，是在另一个明代大思想家王守仁讲学的遗址上修建起来的。纪念馆除保存了与黄宗羲、王守仁、朱舜水、严子陵等有关的实物和著作外，还收藏了大量浙东地区的重要图书文物。其中包括新石器时代的遗物和大革命时期的革命文献。（余仁杰）
