Right-wing bourgeois elements attack our survey and statistical methods as unscientific, claiming that statistical data lacks a scientific basis and that our country has not yet established scientific statistical work; they also say that we should not learn from the Soviet Union's socialist statistical work, but should learn from Anglo-American bourgeois statistics, etc. They attempt to usurp the leadership of statistical work through this. In reality, this is a futile effort. The remarkable achievements of our country's statistical work, the superiority of socialist statistics armed with Marxist-Leninist historical materialism and political economics, can never be obliterated or overturned by a few absurd words from right-wing elements.

Social and economic statistics is a social science and has a class nature; it belongs to the superstructure. Socialist statistics serve the people and socialist construction. Bourgeois statistics serve the bourgeoisie and maintain the capitalist system. To build socialism and establish socialist statistical work, we can only learn from the socialist Soviet Union and its advanced socialist statistical theories and experience, and not from capitalist countries. Although we can learn certain technical aspects of bourgeois statistics to serve socialist construction, socialist statistics differ fundamentally from bourgeois statistics in terms of stance and viewpoint, which is the fundamental difference between us and the bourgeois right-wing elements.

In the past, due to our insufficient and incomplete understanding and knowledge of China's specific conditions, our lack of necessary knowledge and experience in socialist statistical work, and the presence of certain degrees of bureaucracy and subjectivism in our work style and thinking methods, there were inevitably many shortcomings in our statistical work. For example, survey and statistical methods were simple and inflexible, often resorting to issuing forms for comprehensive surveys whenever data was needed, without utilizing sampling surveys, and the Party's rich experience in typical surveys was not fully utilized. Due to the above reasons, and the lax management of forms, the phenomenon of excessive and chaotic statistical forms has persisted for a long time. During this rectification campaign, statistical departments at all levels should work with planning and financial accounting departments to thoroughly clean up existing forms in factories, mines, enterprises, and rural areas, and actively propose improvement measures. Furthermore, the processing, compilation, analysis, and research of statistical data have not been done well enough, and various specialized or comprehensive analytical research reports have not been promptly submitted according to the needs of the Party and government leaders' central tasks in each period. It should be pointed out that statistical work should not only occupy materials, but also analyze the materials it occupies, find contradictions, and propose solutions to the contradictions. Only such statistical work can play a huge role in the country's socialist construction. Judging from this requirement, we still need to constantly work hard to improve our statistical work over the past few years. Furthermore, the phenomenon of delayed submission of certain necessary statistical data still exists, and this shortcoming must be quickly overcome. Only by constantly overcoming shortcomings in our work can we improve the level of statistical work.

Our country's First Five-Year Plan is about to be successfully completed, and the Second Five-Year Plan is being drafted. Now, the task facing the national statistical workers, in general, is to meet the further development and improvement requirements of the country's socialist construction and national economic planning and management work, and to greatly improve our country's socialist statistical work.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, we must continue to implement the policy of proceeding from the six hundred million people, "overall planning and comprehensive consideration, appropriate arrangements." This requires that future statistical work should not only reflect the specific situation of various departments of the national economy, but also calculate the overall account of the national economy; it should also study the major proportional relationships in the development of the national economy, such as the relationship between national strength and construction; the relationship between construction and people's livelihood, that is, the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption in the use of national income; the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture, as well as various proportional relationships within industry and agriculture, etc. Only in this way can statistical work play a greater role in national construction and planning work. In order to do a good job in the comprehensive research of the overall situation of the national economy, it is also necessary to further strengthen and improve the various professional statistical work during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and quickly overcome the current weak links, so as to provide comprehensive and correct statistical data to the Party and government leading organs and planning departments at all levels in a more timely manner.

The experience of the First Five-Year Plan proves that agriculture is of great importance in our country. The speed of agricultural production development not only directly affects the development of light industry production, but also affects the overall national construction and the arrangement of people's lives. Therefore, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, we must simultaneously develop industry and agriculture on the basis of continuing to prioritize the development of heavy industry. According to this requirement, future statistical work must also vigorously carry out agricultural statistics. In the past few years, the national agricultural statistical work has made many achievements, but in general, it is still a weak link in the various professional statistics. In the past, it was indeed difficult to do a good job in agricultural statistics on the basis of a scattered small-scale peasant economy. But the situation is different now. Agricultural cooperativization has been basically completed. We should establish a more scientific agricultural statistical work on the basis of cooperativization to meet the needs of the country. In particular, we must do a good job in crop yield statistics and the investigation of the production and income distribution of cooperatives, so as to ensure that the various agricultural statistical figures can have a more sufficient scientific basis and can meet the requirements of various aspects of the Party and government leading organs.

In order to correctly handle contradictions among the people and adjust contradictions among the people with foresight, we must earnestly study the issues of people's lives and distribution, and study the relationship between production, construction, and people's lives. In the past, statistical work paid more attention to production and construction, and did not do enough in statistics on people's lives and distribution. This situation must be changed in the future, and the statistical work on people's lives and distribution must be strengthened. On the one hand, we must earnestly do a good job in labor and wage statistics, and on the other hand, we must improve and strengthen the current ongoing family income and expenditure survey of workers and peasants, and deeply study the improvement of the living conditions of urban and rural people in our country through these data.

Recently, statistical departments at all levels should promptly provide various comprehensive and correct statistical data needed for the compilation of the Second Five-Year Plan, and do a good job in the inspection of the results of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. In the future, statistical work should play a greater role in the formulation and inspection of annual plans, and submit reports on the implementation of the national economic plan on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis in a timely manner.

Statistical agencies at all levels must further strengthen ideological and organizational leadership in their work in the future, and constantly improve the political and ideological level and business work ability of statistical cadres; continue to study and improve various survey and statistical methods and accounting methods, and better serve the Party and government leadership and planning work. Party and government leading organs at all levels should further strengthen their leadership over statistical work, so that statistical cadres can be as stable and professional as possible, and help them overcome difficulties in their work.

Statistical work is an important part of our country's socialist construction cause. It is a serious scientific work, and at the same time, it is a work with strong ideological and policy implications. All statistical cadres should, under the leadership of the Party and the government, continuously improve their Marxist-Leninist theoretical level and political and ideological level, correct their work attitude, and strive for greater achievements in our country's socialist statistical work!

### 统计工作应该怎样改进

    统计工作应该怎样改进
    资产阶级右派分子攻击我们的调查统计方法不科学，统计资料缺乏科学根据，说我国还根本没有建立起科学的统计工作；说我们不应向苏联的社会主义统计工作学习，应该向英美的资产阶级统计学学习等等。他们企图以此来篡夺统计工作的领导。其实，这是枉费心机。我国统计工作的显著成就，以马克思列宁主义历史唯物论和政治经济学武装起来的社会主义统计学的优越性，绝不是右派分子的几句胡言谰语所能抹煞的，所能推翻的。
    社会经济统计学是一门社会科学，是有阶级性的，它属于上层建筑的范畴。社会主义的统计学，是为人民服务的，是为社会主义建设服务的。而资产阶级的统计学则是为资产阶级服务的，是为维护资本主义制度的。我们要建设社会主义，建立社会主义的统计工作，当然只能向社会主义的苏联学习，学习苏联先进的社会主义统计理论和经验，而不能向资本主义国家学习。尽管资产阶级统计学中的某些技术方面，我们也可以学来为社会主义建设服务，但在立场、观点方面，社会主义统计学却与资产阶级统计学有本质的不同，这也就是我们和资产阶级右派分子的根本分歧所在。
    过去一个时期，由于我们对中国的具体情况还了解、认识得不深、不透，对社会主义的统计工作还缺乏必要的知识和经验，加以我们工作作风上和思想方法上还存在着一定的官僚主义、主观主义，因之，在统计工作中也就不可避免地还存在着不少缺点。如调查统计方法简单，不灵活，往往一要资料就是颁发报表进行全面调查，不会利用抽样调查，对我们党有丰富经验的典型调查方法也没有充分利用。由于上述原因，和对报表管理不严，也就形成了长时期以来一直存在的统计报表过多和混乱的现象。在这次整风中，各级统计部门应当会同计划部门和财务会计部门，就现有各厂矿企业和农村中的各种报表加以彻底清理，并积极提出改进的措施。再如，对统计资料的加工整理和分析研究工作，也做得不够，未能很好根据党政领导每一时期的中心工作的要求，及时提出各种专门问题或综合性的分析研究报告。应该指出，统计工作不仅要占有材料，而且要对占有的材料加以分析，找出矛盾，提出解决矛盾的办法。只有这样的统计工作，才能对国家的社会主义建设发挥巨大作用。根据这一要求来衡量我们过去几年的统计工作，我们还要不断的努力才行。再如，我们某些必需的统计资料报送迟缓的现象仍然存在，这个缺点也必须迅速克服。只有不断克服工作中的缺点，才能提高统计工作的水平。
    我国的第一个五年计划即将胜利完成，第二个五年计划已在着手编制。现在，摆在全国统计工作者面前的任务，总的说来，就是要适应国家社会主义建设和国民经济计划管理工作的进一步发展和提高的要求，把我国的社会主义统计工作大大提高一步。
    在第二个五年计划时期中，要继续贯彻执行从六亿人民出发，“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的方针。这就要求今后的统计工作，不仅能反映国民经济各部门的具体情况，而且要计算国民经济的全面大账；要研究国民经济发展中的各项重大比例关系，如国力和建设的关系；建设和人民生活的关系，也就是国民收入使用中积累和消费的比例关系；工业和农业的比例关系，以及工农业内部的各种比例关系等等。只有这样，统计工作才能对国家建设和计划工作发挥更大的作用。为了做好国民经济全面情况的综合研究工作，第二个五年计划时期中，还必须进一步加强和提高各项专业统计工作，迅速克服目前的某些薄弱环节，做到更加及时地向各级党政领导机关和计划部门提供全面的、正确的统计资料。
    第一个五年计划的经验证明，农业在我国有着非常重要的意义。农业生产发展的快慢，不仅直接影响轻工业生产的发展，而且也影响着整个国家建设和人民生活的安排。因此在第二个五年计划时期中，要在继续以优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举。根据这个要求，今后的统计工作，也必须大力做好农业统计。过去几年中，全国的农业统计工作，虽已取得了不少成绩，但是总的说来它还是各项专业统计中的一个薄弱环节。过去在分散的小农经济基础上，要做好农业统计确实是困难的。但是现在的情况不同了，农业的合作化已基本完成，我们应在合作化的基础上，适应国家的需要，迅速建立起比较科学的农业统计工作。特别要做好农产量统计和合作社的生产和收益分配调查工作，以保证各项农业统计数字能够有更充分的科学根据，并能够满足党政领导机关各方面的要求。
    为了正确处理人民内部矛盾，并有预见地调整人民内部矛盾，我们要认真研究人民生活和分配问题，研究生产、建设和人民生活的关系。过去一个时期的统计工作，对生产、建设注意的多些，对人民生活和分配方面的统计则做得很不够。今后必须切实改变这种状况，加强人民生活和分配方面的统计工作。一方面要认真做好劳动工资统计，另一方面要改进和加强目前正在进行的职工和农民的家庭收支调查工作，并通过这些资料来深入研究我国城乡人民生活的改善状况。
    最近一个时期，各级统计部门应该及时提供编制第二个五年计划所需要的各种全面的、正确的统计资料，做好第一个五年计划执行结果的检查工作。今后的统计工作，要在年度计划的编制和检查中起更大的作用，要按月、按季、按年及时提出国民经济计划执行情况的报告。
    各级统计机构今后必须更加加强工作中的思想领导和组织领导，不断提高统计工作干部的政治思想水平和业务工作能力；继续研究和改进各种调查统计方法和核算方法，更好地为党政领导服务，为计划工作服务。各级党政领导机关要进一步加强对统计工作的领导，使统计工作干部尽可能稳定和专业化，帮助他们克服工作中的困难。
    统计工作是我国社会主义建设事业中的一个重要组成部分，是一门严肃的科学工作，同时又是一门思想性政策性很强的工作。全体统计工作干部，应在党和政府的领导下，不断提高自己的马克思列宁主义的理论水平和政治思想水平，端正工作态度，为我国的社会主义统计工作获得更大的成就而奋斗！
