Many Ways to Save Coal

   Editor's note: Saving coal for winter heating is of great significance for easing the tight coal supply. Last winter, central government agencies achieved great success in saving coal for heating and created many experiences. Now, we are publishing a summary of some of the experiences summarized by the State Council机关事务管理局 (Government Offices Administration Bureau of the State Council) for your reference.

    The advancement and backwardness of operating methods directly affect coal saving or coal waste. Therefore, improving and raising operating methods is a crucial task. Last year, in addition to adopting past experiences such as quick coal adding (adding coal frequently and thinly), burning lump coal and fine coal separately, adding water to fine coal, and burning furnace ash again, various units also created many new experiences. Among these experiences, the following can be widely promoted:

    Reduce the area of the fire bed: Seal about one-third of the back of the boiler fire bed with bricks to reduce the area for adding coal, thereby reducing the amount of coal added each time without affecting the firepower. The transportation department's thirteenth boiler sealed five pieces, reducing coal consumption by 25%.
    Intermittent firing: After the room temperature reaches the standard temperature, begin to damp down the fire, and resume supplying gas when the room temperature drops. This method is best used after 10 am when the outdoor temperature increases. The Personnel Bureau uses this method and can stop burning for two or three hours each day.
    Rotating air supply: This method is suitable for boiler rooms with a large heating area, insufficient boiler load capacity, and several gas supply pipes. The method is to not supply gas to all pipes at the beginning of gas supply, but to close a part of the gas supply pipes first and use all the heating to centrally supply the other part of the gas supply pipes, so that the room temperature quickly reaches the standard temperature, and then rotate the gas supply. Due to the concentrated gas supply, the room temperature rises quickly, shortening the firing time and saving coal. Units with excessively long pipelines can concentrate on supplying parts of the pipelines that are farther away, and then supply parts closer to the boiler.
    Install branch valves on the gas supply pipes or add air resistance pads to the radiators to adjust the imbalance of room temperature on the sunny and shady sides. Due to the different sunny and shady sides of the rooms and the distance from the boiler room, the room temperature often cannot be balanced. If the temperature of the shady side rooms is taken care of, the temperature of the sunny side rooms will be too high, which will cause waste of heating. The method of adding air resistance pads to the radiators and installing branch valves on the gas supply pipes can effectively adjust the imbalance of room temperature, thereby avoiding waste of heating.
    Local fire sealing: When sealing the fire, concentrate the fire surface on a corner of the front of the fire bed (about one-fourth of the area), and then seal the fire. The Ministry of Justice saved two-thirds of the coal after changing from sealing the entire fire to sealing one corner in the past.
    Progressive damping: This method is suitable for boiler rooms with more than two boilers. When sealing the fire, damp down some of the boilers in advance, leaving a few to continue heating. This saves coal and does not cause the room temperature to drop quickly. After the Ministry of Public Security adopted this method, a boiler room with four boilers saved 500 jin of coal every day.
    Use of return water: Generally, about four-fifths of the heating return water can be recovered. This water retains a certain temperature. If fully utilized, it can reduce the amount of cold water added by an equal amount. This can make the gas supply earlier and save coal.

    The above operating methods can be selected and applied by various units according to specific circumstances, and can be further researched and improved on the existing basis.

    节约煤炭门路多
   编者按：节约冬季取暖用煤，对于和缓煤炭供应紧张情况有极重大的意义。去年冬季，中央国家机关在节约取暖用煤方面取得了很大的成绩，创造了许多经验。现在，我们把国务院机关事务管理局总结的一部分摘要发表在下面，供各地参考。
    操作方法的先进和落后，直接影响到省煤或费煤。所以，改进和提高操作方法是一件关键性的工作。去年，各单位除了采用过去推行的三快添煤：勤撒薄添、块末分烧、末煤加水、炉灰回烧等经验外，还创造了许多新的经验。这些经验中可以普遍推广应用的，我们认为有如下几种：
    缩小火床面积：把锅炉的火床后部用砖封砌三分之一左右，使添煤面积缩小，减少每次添煤量，同时又不影响火力。交通部十三片的锅炉封砌了五片，烧煤量降低了25％。
  间歇烧火：在室温烧到标准温度以后，便开始压火，待室温下降，再行供气。这一办法以上午十时后室外温度增高时采用为宜。人事局采用这个办法，每天可停烧二、三小时。
    轮流送气：这种办法适用于供暖面积较大、锅炉负荷力不足而又有几个输气管的锅炉房。作法是在开始送气时。不作全面输送，先关闭一部分输气管，用全部暖气集中供应另一部分输气管，使室温很快达到标准温度，然后再轮换送气。由于集中供气，室温上升得快，缩短了烧火时间，便节省了用煤。有些管道过长的单位，可集中供管道较远的部分，再供靠近锅炉的部分。
    在输气管上安装分结门或在暖气片上加阻气垫，以调节阴阳面房间室温的不平衡。由于房间的阴阳面和距离锅炉房远近的不同，室温往往不能达到平衡。如果照顾了阴面房间的温度，便会使阳面房间的温度过高，这就造成暖气的浪费。采用暖气片加阻气垫和输气管装分结门的办法，可以有效地调节室温的不平衡，从而避免暖气的浪费。
    局部封火：在封火时，将火面集中在火床前部一角（约占四分之一面积），然后再封火。司法部把过去封整火改为封一角以后，节约煤炭三分之二。
    陆续压火：这种办法适用于两台锅炉以上的锅炉房。在封火时将部分锅炉提前压火，留下少数几台继续供暖。这样既节省了用煤，又不使室温很快下降。公安部采用这一办法以后，在一个四台锅炉的锅炉房，每天就节省五百斤煤。
    利用回水：暖气回水一般可收回五分之四左右。这些水都保有一定温度，如果充分利用，就可以少上相等数量冷水。这样就可以提早上气，节约用煤。
    上述操作方法，各单位可以根据具体情况选择应用，同时可以在现有基础上继续研究，进一步提高。
