    New Members Arrive at Agricultural Cooperative
    Top picture: Recently, a group of new members arrived at the Red May Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaojiahe Township, Beijing suburbs. They are cadres from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau who have been sent to work in the countryside. Although they are not yet accustomed to the labor, they are in high spirits and work very hard. This is a scene of new and old members transporting sweet potatoes together.
    Bottom picture: Four new members live in the home of poor peasant Grandma Cheng. They are as close as family. After returning from the fields, they rush to help Grandma Cheng with odd jobs. Grandma Cheng has three sons, but they are not by her side. Now she tells everyone she meets: "I have gained a few more sons now." Xinhua News Agency reporter An Kang, photo

    农业社来了新社员
    上图　北京郊区肖家河乡红五月农业社里最近来了一批新社员，他们是北京市公安局的下放干部。劳动对他们虽然还不习惯，但是他们情绪很高，干起活来很起劲。这是新老社员在一起运白薯。
    下图　四名新社员住在贫农程大妈家里，他们亲如一家人，下地回来抢着帮程大妈干点零碎活。程大妈有三个儿子，可都不在身边，现在她见人就说：“我如今又添了几个儿子了。”　新华社记者　安　康摄
