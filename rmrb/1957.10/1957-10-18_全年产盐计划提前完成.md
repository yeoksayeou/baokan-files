　　Annual Salt Production Plan Completed Ahead of Schedule

　　(Our report) As of October 14th, according to incomplete statistics from salt fields across the country, over 7,035,000 tons of salt have been produced, completing 100.5% of the annual state plan, an increase of 61.24% compared to the same period last year. The northern sea salt regions have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests this year. The Liaoning Bureau had completed the total output of the first Five-Year Plan by mid-September; the Changlu Tangda Bureau had reached the production level of the first Five-Year Plan by early October; the Hangu and Shandong Bureaus had also completed 119.73% and 101.13% of their annual plans respectively by early October. The abundant production in these regions has eased the current tight supply of crude salt to a certain extent.

　　The Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Food Industry held a meeting of the heads of sea salt bureaus in August. Based on the weather department's prediction of less rainfall in the second half of the year, it proposed an increase of 560,000 tons of salt and put forward appropriate technical measures. The vast number of workers in various salt regions enthusiastically responded to this call, seized the favorable weather conditions, and vigorously carried out autumn production, finally achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest.

　　全年产盐计划提前完成
    本报讯　全国各盐场到10月14日止，据不完全统计，已经产盐七百零三万五千多吨，完成全年国家计划100.5％，比去年同期增产61.24％。北方几个海盐区今年更获得了空前的丰产。辽宁局至9月中旬止已完成第一个五年计划的总产量；长芦塘大局至10月上旬已达到第一个五年计划的生产水平；汉沽和山东两局至10月上旬也分别完成年计划119.73％和101.13％。这些地区的丰产，使当前原盐的供应紧张局面，得到了一定程度的缓和。
    食品工业部盐务总局曾在8月份召开海盐区各局局长会议，根据气象科学研究部门预测下半年少雨的情况，提出了增产五十六万吨盐的要求，并且提出了适当的技术措施。各盐区广大职工热烈响应了这一号召，抓紧有利天时，大力进行秋产，终于取得了空前的丰产。
