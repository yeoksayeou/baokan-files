Eliminating Concerns, From Coldness to Enthusiasm
Zhejiang's County-Level Basic Cadres Fully Speak Out

(Reported by our newspaper) Seventy-four counties in Zhejiang Province have concluded or are in the process of holding three-level or four-level cadre meetings. At the cadre meetings in each county, attendees actively engaged in "big blooming, big contending" through methods such as big-character posters, suggestion boxes, group discussions, speeches at general meetings, and individual heart-to-heart talks. According to statistics from 24 counties in Jiaxing, Ningbo, Jiande, and other special districts, cadres in attendance put forward more than 125,000 suggestions, with the most focusing on grain, cooperativization, and the leadership of the Party. Among the opinions raised by cadres in each county, generally over 70% are well-intentioned and correct, around 20% are basically correct, and erroneous opinions are generally below 10%.

The general pattern of "big blooming, big contending" in each county is a progression from coldness to enthusiasm, from raising positive opinions to raising negative opinions, and from raising general opinions to focusing on a central issue. Initially, many cadres had concerns about "big blooming, big contending." They feared retaliation, punishment, being made a typical example for criticism, and being labeled as "Rightists." They wanted to speak out, but were afraid to do so. Counties where "big blooming, big contending" reached a high tide and was carried out relatively thoroughly were those where the county leadership was determined, repeatedly explained the significance of "big blooming, big contending" to the cadres, expressed their attitude, first resolved the ideological problems of the general branch secretaries and above, boldly mobilized the masses, dispelled concerns, and the leading core took the lead in "blooming and contending." At the same time, organizations such as opinion-handling groups and rectification-while-correcting committees were established to research, improve, and promptly resolve problems that could be resolved while "blooming and contending." After seven counties in the Ningbo Special District did this, about 90% of the cadres in attendance fully submitted or basically completed submitting their opinions. However, a few county leaders were afraid of chaos and did not dare to boldly launch "blooming and contending." Some put forward many restrictive rules, such as defining the scope of "blooming and contending" and requiring that opinions raised during "blooming and contending" be correct. Some were eager to argue and offered explanations too early. Some leading cadres smiled when they heard good opinions but frowned when they heard bad opinions. These all affected "blooming and contending."

Currently, cadre meetings in most counties in Zhejiang Province are in the midst of "big blooming, big contending, and big debate." On the evening of October 5th, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference, giving instructions on the current situation and requesting that leaders at all levels continue to boldly launch "blooming and contending" and rectify while correcting, so that a nationwide rectification movement can be smoothly carried out in the province's rural areas.

    消除顾虑从冷淡到热烈
    浙江各县基层干部大鸣大放
    本报讯　浙江省七十四个县结束了或正在举行三级或四级干部会议。在各县干部会议上，到会干部通过大字报、意见箱、小组座谈、大会发言、个别谈心等方式，热烈展开了大鸣大放。据嘉兴、宁波、建德等专区二十四个县统计，到会干部共提出十二万五千多条意见，其中以粮食、合作化和党的领导三个方面的意见为最多。各县干部提出的意见中，一般有70％以上是善意的、正确的，20％左右是基本上正确的，错误意见一般在10％以下。
    各县大鸣大放的规律，一般是由冷淡到热烈，由提正面意见到提反面意见，由提一般性意见到围绕着一个中心提出意见。开始时很多干部对大鸣大放存在着顾虑，他们怕报复，怕处分，怕当典型批判，怕戴右派帽子，他们要求放又怕放。凡是鸣放形成高潮、放得比较彻底的县，都是县的领导上决心大，再三向干部说明了鸣放的意义，表明了态度，首先解决乡总支书记以上领导干部的思想问题，放手发动群众，解除顾虑，领导骨干带头鸣放；同时成立处理意见的小组、边整边改委员会等组织，一边鸣放，一边研究，一边改进，及时解决能够解决的问题。宁波专区七个县这样做以后，到会干部90％左右全部提出或基本上提完自己的意见。也有少数县的领导干部怕放乱了，不敢放手发动鸣放。有的提出许多清规戒律，如划定鸣放的范围、提出鸣放的意见要正确等，有的急于争辩，过早解释，有的领导干部听好的意见就笑，不好的意见就扳面孔。这些都影响了鸣放。
    目前，浙江省大部分县的干部会议正在大放大鸣大争。5日晚，中共浙江省委召开电话会议，对当前情况作了指示，要求各县领导上继续放手发动鸣放，边整边改，以便全省农村顺利开展全民性整风运动。（新华社专稿）
