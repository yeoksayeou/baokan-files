Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: Paris Dispatch: According to "France-Soir," a large number of Turkish troops equipped with the latest weapons conducted large-scale exercises along the Syrian and Soviet borders.

The newspaper's special correspondent in the Near East, Nidelgang, said that the exercises were extremely secretive. Reserve specialists were conscripted. The relevant border areas were declared restricted zones.

The reporter emphasized that this was the first large-scale exercise of the Turkish army in ten years. The duration of the exercise was originally scheduled for two weeks. He said that the Turkish government had decided to continue the exercises.

Another dispatch: The British Arab News Agency quoted an authoritative source in Damascus on the 16th as saying that "a very large Turkish concentration, including 200 tanks," had been seen near the Syrian border in the past few hours.

Ankara Dispatch: Turkish officials on the 16th warmly welcomed the remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on the same day, which encouraged Turkey to provoke Syria.

Turkish officials described Dulles's remarks, which backed Turkey's provocative behavior, as "the actions of a true friend and ally."

It is reported that the Turkish government responded to Syria's note on the 16th, rejecting Syria's protest. In its note to Turkey last week, Syria protested against Turkey's troop build-up and provocations on the Syrian border.

Damascus Dispatch: According to the Middle East News Agency on the 16th, the Syrian army has declared a state of emergency.

Syrian authorities received intelligence from the Syrian northern border security authorities on the 16th that the Turkish troops assembled along the Syrian border were increasing, and these troops were equipped with tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery.

"Al-Nour" reported on the 16th that many public gatherings have recently been held in various areas of Aleppo to mobilize the people to participate in the People's Resistance Organization. The newspaper said that in this city close to the Turkish border, people enthusiastically participated in the People's Resistance Organization and established training classes on how to use weapons.

Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on the 16th: "Syria is ready to cope with all contingencies and will repel aggression from any side."

Al-Assali made the remarks regarding the news of Turkish troops gathering on the Syrian border: "We have shed blood and sacrificed for independence and sovereignty. If any violence wants to invade us, we, young and old, will unite to defend our country."

Al-Assali pointed out that Syria is not isolated in the struggle against aggression and will receive the support of Arab countries and all peace-loving people.

Syrian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Staff Bizri warned Turkey on the same day not to launch an aggression against Syria. He said: "The Syrian and Egyptian armies and all the Arab people are ready to defend every inch of Syrian land."

Syrian parliamentary opposition leaders, including People's Party leader al-Kikhiya, al-Dawalibi, and other members of parliament, visited Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali on the 16th. They expressed to al-Assali their willingness to unite with the current Syrian government to cope with any possible events.
