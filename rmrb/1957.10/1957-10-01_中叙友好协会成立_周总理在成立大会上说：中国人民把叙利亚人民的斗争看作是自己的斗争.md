Tawfiq Yazji, head of the Syrian journalists delegation, who was invited to attend the meeting, delivered a speech to the conference. He said that your active establishment of this friendship association with lofty sentiments will not only have a good impact on Syria but also on Syria's brotherly country, Egypt, and all Arab countries.

He said that we hope that more associations like this will be established, spreading throughout Asia and then throughout the world, becoming a world of peace and friendship between people of all countries. Tawfiq Yazji finally said that we, like you, are determined to strengthen the power of this Friendship Association every day and every hour.

Farah, a representative of the Syrian youth, said at the meeting that the Syrian people are less than four million, but when they become friends with the Chinese people, they become friends with a quarter of the world's population. How can they not feel proud? Farah said that when Egypt was invaded, we had already recognized the strength and role of the Chinese people's friendship. Recently, when imperialism stepped up its pressure and provocation against Syria, we once again recognized the strength and role of the Chinese people's friendship, and the Chinese people's support for us has increased our strength.

Khaled Hammad, head of the Syrian film delegation, said that the support given by the Chinese people to the struggle of people of all countries for freedom and independence is the pride of people of all countries who love peace and freedom.

Khalil Khald Abdel Nour, head of the Syrian student delegation, said that our celebration of the establishment of the China-Syria Friendship Association with you today powerfully and concretely demonstrates the strong and brotherly ties between our two countries. He emphasized that imperialism must die, and it must be beaten to a bloody pulp under the iron hammer of peace-loving and liberation-seeking people all over the world.

At the meeting, a telegram from Da Puson to Syrian President Kuwatli and the Syrian people was read.
