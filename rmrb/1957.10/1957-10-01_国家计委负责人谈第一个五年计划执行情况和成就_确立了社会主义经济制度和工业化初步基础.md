A Responsible Person from the State Planning Commission Talks About the Implementation and Achievements of the First Five-Year Plan
Establishing a Socialist Economic System and the Preliminary Foundation for Industrialization

    (Our Dispatch) A responsible person from the State Planning Commission, at the request of reporters from this newspaper and Xinhua News Agency on the eve of National Day, gave a talk on the achievements and significance of the First Five-Year Plan.
    The responsible person said that our country's First Five-Year Plan is coming to an end soon. The implementation of the plan and the lessons learned still need to be summarized in the future. However, it can be affirmed that the basic tasks and various specific tasks stipulated in the plan have been successfully completed. So far, with the exception of a few indicators, the vast majority of indicators have been completed or overfulfilled.
    After the First Five-Year Plan, China's national economy has undergone tremendous and profound changes. People remember that when our country's First Five-Year Plan began, although our country had restored the national economy that had been destroyed by long-term wars, making social productivity generally reach or even exceed the highest level in Chinese history, and the socialist state-owned economy had developed greatly and played a leading role in other economic components, at that time, our country was still an economically and technologically backward country with very complex economic components. Not only was the industrial base weak, but the small-scale peasant economy was dominant, technology was even more backward, and the capitalist economy still accounted for a large proportion. Now, after a short period of less than five years, due to our overfulfilling the tasks of socialist construction and socialist transformation stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, the economic outlook of our country has greatly improved.
    The responsible person said that the most important achievement of China's First Five-Year Plan is that the state completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce ahead of schedule and overfulfilled the plan. In 1956, 96.3% of farmers and 92% of handicraftsmen nationwide had realized cooperation, and almost all capitalist industry and commerce had realized joint state-private ownership. This year, these new socialist economies have undergone tremendous consolidation work organizationally and ideologically, and have achieved new successes. As a result, our country's national economy has basically changed from multiple components to a single socialist component, thus basically ending the history of the class exploitation system in our country for thousands of years and establishing a socialist economic system. The responsible person said that it should be particularly pointed out here that this huge and drastic change in the social relations of production in our country has not only not damaged social productivity in the process, but has also significantly promoted the development of social productivity. The situation of the great development of the national economy in 1956 fully proves this point. In the long run, the establishment of socialist relations of production in our country has opened up a broad road for the smooth development of social productivity. Of course, the socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production in our country has not completely ended, especially the ideological struggle (political and ideological struggle) between capitalism and socialism will continue for a considerable period of time in our country. We should continue to work hard to strengthen and consolidate the socialist position.
    Our country's achievements in socialist construction are also very significant. As the core of the Five-Year Plan, industrial capital construction will, in terms of investment, exceed the plan by more than 5% in the five years. Among the industrial construction units above the quota, with the 156 projects designed by the Soviet Union to help China as the backbone, a total of 825 have started construction in the five years, and a total of 448 will be completed by the end of this year, of which 56 belong to the 156 projects. These more than 800 projects are the first batch of backbones of China's modern large-scale industry, which have a huge role in China's socialist industrialization. Although they have not all been completed, they have laid a preliminary foundation for China's socialist industrialization. Due to this construction, we have not only generally strengthened the metallurgical industry, the fuel industry, the power industry, the machine manufacturing industry, the chemical industry, the building materials industry, and light industry, but also opened up many new industrial sectors, such as the smelting and processing of alloy steel and aluminum and other non-ferrous metals, the manufacturing of automobiles and aircraft, the manufacturing of metallurgical, power generation, and mining equipment, and the manufacturing of radio and precision instruments. Due to the establishment of these new industrial sectors, the original incomplete state of China's industry has begun to change. These new industrial enterprises are distributed throughout the country, most of which are distributed in the inland areas where there was originally very little industry, thus beginning to change the original state of China's industry being concentrated in one area.
    The responsible person pointed out that China's industrial construction is not carried out in isolation. Agriculture, transportation, and other economic undertakings have also undergone large-scale construction. In agriculture, water conservancy, and forestry, the capital construction investment in the five years reached more than 3.8 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan by more than 50%. In water conservancy, in addition to the construction of more than a dozen large reservoirs, many small and medium-sized water conservancy projects were also built, and extensive farmland water conservancy work was carried out, which not only prevented huge floods, but also increased the irrigated area by more than 200 million mu. In the five years, the wasteland reclaimed by the state and the masses reached 80 million mu, more than double the plan. In terms of transportation, important projects include the construction of more than 4,920 kilometers of new railway trunk lines and branch lines, and 12,000 kilometers of highway trunk lines built with central investment, both exceeding the plan by about 20%.
    The responsible person said that large-scale economic construction has strengthened and trained China's technical force. In 1952, there were only more than 170,000 engineering and technical personnel in various departments of the national economy. It is estimated that there will be 800,000 in 1957, an increase of about 3.5 times. Due to the efforts of the vast majority of engineering and technical personnel to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and under the guidance of Soviet experts, the technical level has been greatly improved. Now, general large-scale enterprises, including iron and steel joint enterprises, coal mines, power stations, oil refineries, machine manufacturing factories, chemical factories, as well as railways and reservoirs, can design themselves, except for those with more complex resource conditions and higher technical requirements. This is a great progress in technology in our country.
    The responsible person said that China's First Five-Year Plan adopted the policy of giving full play to the production potential of existing enterprises to accelerate the construction of new enterprises. In addition to carrying out major renovations on some old enterprises, the vast majority of old enterprises have strengthened technical measures, improved management levels, and promoted the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers, so that the potential of existing enterprises has been fully exploited. In this process, the Party and the government have criticized the bad tendency of abandoning the old and favoring the new. It is precisely because of the adoption of such a policy that our country's industrial production, agricultural production, and transportation have achieved a very high rate of development, and most indicators have greatly exceeded the original plan. China's total industrial output value in 1957 has reached 223.4% of that in 1952, with an average annual growth rate of 17.4%, which is 112.7% of the original plan. Among them, the output value of means of production in 1957 was 290.2% of that in 1952, with an average annual growth rate of 23.7%, which is 128.1% of the original plan; the output value of consumer goods in 1957 was 179.4% of that in 1952, with an average annual growth rate of 12.4%, which is 99.8% of the original plan. In agriculture, the total agricultural output value in 1957 was 126.4% of that in 1952, with an average annual growth rate of 4.8%, which is 102.5% of the original plan. Among them, the grain output value in 1957 was 123.7% of that in 1952, with an average annual growth rate of 4.3%, which is 103.2% of the original plan; the cotton output value in 1957 was 115.1% of that in 1952, with an average annual growth rate of 2.9%, which is 91.7% of the original plan. In terms of transportation, the railway freight volume in 1957 was 193.8% of that in 1952, with an average annual growth rate of 14.1%, which is 104.3% of the original plan; the highway freight volume in 1957 was 503.2% of that in 1952, with an average annual growth rate of 38.2%, which is 154.5% of the original plan.
    The above percentages, the level of 1957 is calculated according to the annual plan figures. According to the current estimates, except for some indicators of agricultural production, the above other indicators are likely to exceed, so the actual speed may be higher. Taking steel production as an example, the annual plan for 1957 is 4.987 million tons, and it is expected to reach about 5.2 million tons.
    The responsible person believes that the relationship between industry and agriculture in the First Five-Year Plan is basically coordinated. Compared with 1952, China's agriculture increased grain production by more than 70 billion catties and cotton by 4 million dan, and other cash crops and livestock have also increased more, ensuring the needs of the people's lives and ensuring the smooth progress of national construction. Of course, from an objective point of view, our country's agriculture still appears to be somewhat backward, and we must use greater efforts to accelerate the development of agriculture in the future.
    The responsible person believes that the increase in output is certainly a major achievement in China's economy, and the increase in the variety of industrial products is also very important. For example, in 1952, China could only produce more than 180 kinds of steel and more than 400 specifications of steel products. In 1957, it could produce more than 370 kinds of steel and more than 3,000 specifications of steel products. In 1957, it was already able to produce more than 200 kinds of new machine tools that could not be produced before liberation. In particular, our country is now able to manufacture many industrial products with high technical requirements, such as 1,000 cubic meter blast furnaces, 185-ton open-hearth furnaces, 12,000-kilowatt thermal power generating equipment and 15,000-kilowatt complete sets of hydroelectric power generating equipment, combined coal mining machines, geological exploration drilling rigs, trucks, jet aircraft, high-efficiency steam locomotives, four-axis automatic lathes, and so on. In this way, the self-sufficiency capacity of our country's equipment and raw materials has also been improved in terms of variety. The strengthening of our country's self-sufficiency capacity in terms of the quantity and variety of equipment and raw materials has created more favorable conditions for larger-scale economic construction in the future.
    The responsible person said that China's economic construction and cultural and educational construction during the First Five-Year Plan were closely integrated. Economic construction promoted the development of cultural and educational construction, and cultural and educational construction helped the development of economic construction in cultivating cadres, improving the level of scientific research, and enriching people's cultural life. During the First Five-Year Plan, more than 270,000 students graduated from universities and more than 840,000 students graduated from secondary specialized schools in our country, most of whom were assigned to various economic departments and scientific research institutions to undertake technical work, greatly strengthening China's scientific and technological team. Many scientists in our country who are loyal to the cause of socialism have made great contributions to economic construction.
    The responsible person pointed out that in a country that accounts for one-thirteenth of the world's land area, one-quarter of the world's population, and whose economy was originally extremely backward, it is nothing short of a matter of great significance to have basically completed the socialist transformation of the national economy and established the preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization in just five years. This matter cannot but have a profound impact not only on China itself, but also on the cause of world peace and democracy.
    The responsible person said that in the process of implementing the First Five-Year Plan, imperialist elements have said more than once: "China's Five-Year Plan is destined to fail." However, in the face of the facts, this lie has already been exposed. In recent years, imperialist elements have spread rumors, saying that "although China's Five-Year Plan can be completed, the people's living standards are constantly declining." Domestic right-wing elements have also echoed, saying that "the Five-Year Plan has ruined things," "unified purchase and sales are terrible," and so on. Zhou Enlai, in his government work report at the National People's Congress in June this year, has powerfully refuted these malicious slanders. Here, only the following facts are cited: during the First Five-Year Plan period, the number of employed workers in our country increased by about 6.5 million, basically eliminating the unemployment left over from old China, and enabling the vast majority of newly added urban labor force to obtain employment opportunities. In 1957, the average wage of workers increased by more than 40% compared with 1952. In five years, state-owned enterprises and state organs paid more than 6 billion yuan in labor insurance funds, medical expenses, welfare expenses, and cultural and educational expenses. In the first four years alone, the state allocated funds to build more than 66 million square meters of workers' housing. These have exceeded the original plan. During this period, due to the state's great efforts to promote the development of agriculture and the adoption of a policy to stabilize the agricultural tax burden, the prices of agricultural products were appropriately increased, ensuring that farmers' income increased and farmers' lives improved considerably. Preliminary calculations show that the total income of farmers in 1957 increased by about 30% compared with 1952.
    The responsible person pointed out that ensuring the development of national construction undertakings on the one hand and ensuring the appropriate improvement of people's living standards on the other hand is an important policy of our country's socialist construction. Related to this construction policy is that our country's economic construction must focus on heavy industry on the one hand, and must fully pay attention to the development of agriculture and light industry on the other hand. The development of industry must be carried out simultaneously with the development of agriculture. Facts have proved that the policy of socialist construction in our country pointed out by Chairman Mao is completely correct. During the First Five-Year Plan period, we implemented this policy, thus achieving great achievements and avoiding the phenomenon of disconnections between various departments of the national economy, especially between industry and agriculture. Of course, we still have shortcomings in our implementation, and we need to continue to work hard in the future.
    The responsible person said that in the First Five-Year Plan period, some shortcomings and errors also occurred in our construction work and planning work, but they were only of a local nature. This point is understood by the people of the whole country, except for a small handful of right-wing elements who distort the facts. What is more important is that we have not only quickly corrected some shortcomings and errors, but also learned lessons from them and stipulated the correct policy for future construction. For example, in construction, we once had the problems of not combining enough with China's actual situation, some construction being greedy for big and new, and not paying enough attention to the combination of large, medium, and small and the full utilization of existing equipment, resulting in some waste. However, the Party and the government criticized these shortcomings and errors and put forward the policy of comprehensive and lasting frugality, that is, the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and managing the family diligently and thriftily. The implementation of this policy will bring great benefits to our country's socialist construction in the future.
    The responsible person said that there are many reasons why we have been able to achieve such great achievements. Domestically, we have a consolidated people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the great Communist Party, and the concerted effort of the people of the whole country. Internationally, we have the enthusiastic support of material, technology, and construction experience from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. With their support, we have reduced many difficulties and avoided many detours.
    Relying on the infinite strength of the broad masses of the people at home on the one hand, and continuing to strengthen close unity and mutual assistance and cooperation with the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union on the other hand, will enable us to build our country into a socialist country with modern industry and modern agriculture in a relatively short period of time.

    国家计委负责人谈第一个五年计划执行情况和成就
    确立了社会主义经济制度和工业化初步基础
    本报讯  国家计划委员会负责人在国庆节前夕应本报记者和新华社记者的要求，对第一个五年计划的成就和意义发表了谈话。
    负责人说，我国的第一个五年计划很快就要结束了，执行计划的情况和经验教训还有待于今后总结，但是可以肯定，这个计划规定的基本任务和各项具体任务是胜利完成了，到现在为止，除少数指标以外，绝大多数指标都已经完成或超额完成。
    经过第一个五年计划，我国的国民经济已经发生了巨大的深刻的变化。人们记得，当我国的第一个五年计划开始的时候，我国虽然恢复了被长期战争所破坏的国民经济，使社会生产力在总的方面达到以至超过了中国历史上的最高水平，社会主义的国营经济已经得到了很大的发展，并且发挥了对其他经济成份的领导作用，但是，在当时，我国仍然是一个经济技术很落后和经济成份很复杂的国家，不仅工业基础薄弱，而且小农经济占优势，技术更加落后，资本主义经济也还占很大的比重。现在经过短短的不到五年的时间，由于我们超额完成了五年计划关于社会主义建设和社会主义改造的任务，我国的经济面貌已经有了很大的改观。
    负责人说，我国第一个五年计划的成就，首先应当指出的是国家提前和超额完成了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的任务。1956年，在全国范围内，农户已经有96.3％、手工业者有92％实现了合作化，资本主义工商业几乎全部实现了公私合营；对于这些新的社会主义经济，今年又在组织上和思想上进行了巨大的巩固工作，获得新的成就。由此，我国的国民经济已经基本上由多种成份转变为单一的社会主义成份，这样也就基本上结束了我国几千年来阶级剥削制度的历史，确立了社会主义的经济制度。负责人说，这里应该特别指出，我国社会生产关系的这种巨大的剧烈的变革，在进程中不仅没有破坏社会生产力，而且明显地推动了社会生产力的发展。1956年国民经济大发展的情况充分证明了这一点。从长远看，我国社会主义生产关系的建立，已为社会生产力的顺利发展开辟了一条康庄大道。当然，现在我国生产资料私有制的社会主义改造工作并没有完全结束，尤其是资本主义和社会主义在意识形态上的斗争（政治和思想的斗争），在我国还要持续相当长的时间，我们应该继续努力加强和巩固社会主义的阵地。
    我国在社会主义建设方面的成就也是十分显著的。作为五年计划中心的工业基本建设，按投资额计算，五年合计将超额完成计划5％以上。以苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六项为骨干的限额以上的工业建设单位，五年内开始施工的共八百二十五个，在今年底能建成的共四百四十八个，其中属于一百五十六项的是五十六个。这八百多个项目是我国现代大工业的第一批骨干，对我国的社会主义工业化事业有巨大的作用，它们虽然还没有全部建成，但是已经为我国的社会主义工业化建立了初步基础。由于这种建设，我们不仅一般地加强了冶金工业、燃料工业、动力工业、机器制造工业、化学工业、建筑材料工业和轻工业，而且开辟了许多新的工业部门，如合金钢和铝及其他有色金属的冶炼和加工，汽车、飞机的制造，冶金、发电、采矿设备的制造，无线电和精密仪表的制造等等。由于这些新工业部门的建立，就开始改变了我国工业原来残缺不全的状况。这些新的工业企业，分布在全国各地，大部分分布在原来工业很少的内地，这样也就开始改变了我国工业原来偏集于一方的状态。
    负责人指出，我国的工业建设不是孤立地进行的，农业、交通运输业和其他经济事业也进行了大规模的建设。在农业、水利和林业方面，五年内基建投资达到三十八亿元以上，超过原计划50％以上；水利方面除了建设了十几座大型水库以外，同时建设了许多中小型水利工程和开展了广泛的农田水利工作，由此不仅防御了巨大的洪水，而且增加了灌溉面积二亿多亩。五年内国家和群众开垦的荒地达到八千万亩，超过计划一倍以上。在交通运输方面，重要的有新建铁路干线和支线四千九百二十多公里，由中央投资修建的公路干线一万二千公里，都超过计划20％左右。
    负责人说，大规模的经济建设壮大和锻炼了我国的技术力量，1952年我国国民经济各部门的工程技术人员不过十七万多人，预计1957年将达到八十万人，增长了三点五倍左右。由于绝大多数的工程技术人员努力学习苏联的先进经验，在苏联专家的指导下，技术水平有了很大的提高。现在，一般的大型企业，包括钢铁联合企业、煤矿、电站、炼油厂、机器制造工厂、化学工厂以及铁路、水库等，除资源条件较复杂和技术条件要求很高的以外，都可以自己设计了。这是我国在技术上的很大进步。
    负责人说，我国的第一个五年计划采取了发挥原有企业的生产潜力来加速新企业建设的方针。除了对一部分老企业进行重大改建以外，对大多数的老企业，加强了技术措施，提高了经营管理水平，发扬了广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，使原有企业的潜力得到比较充分的发挥。在这过程中，党和政府曾经批判了厌旧贪新的不良倾向。正是因为采取了这样的方针，我国的工业生产、农业生产和运输取得了很高的发展速度，并且使多数指标大大超过了原定的计划。我国1957年的工业总产值，已经为1952年的223.4％，平均每年增长速度为17.4％，为原计划的112.7％。其中，生产资料1957年的产值为1952年的290.2％，平均每年增长速度为23.7％，为原计划的128.1％；消费资料1957年的产值为1952年的179.4％，平均每年增长速度为12.4％，为原计划的99.8％。在农业方面，1957年的农业总产值为1952年的126.4％，平均每年增长速度为4.8％，为原计划的102.5％。其中，粮食1957年的产值为1952年的123.7％，平均每年增长速度为4.3％，为原计划的103.2％；棉花1957年的产值为1952年115.1％，平均每年增长速度为2.9％，为原计划的91.7％。在运输方面，1957年铁路货运量为1952年的193.8％，平均每年增长速度为14.1％，为原计划的104.3％；1957年公路货运量为1952年的503.2％，平均每年增长速度为38.2％，为原计划的154.5％。
    上列百分数，1957年的水平是按年度计划数字来计算的，据现在预计，除农业生产的若干指标以外，上述其他指标都有可能超过，因此实际速度可能还要高些。以钢的产量来说，1957年年度计划是四百九十八万七千吨，预计可能达到五百二十万吨左右。
    负责人认为第一个五年工业和农业之间的关系基本上是协调的。1957年比1952年，我国的农业约增产了粮食七百多亿斤和棉花四百万担，其他经济作物和牲畜也都有了较多的增长，保证了人民生活的需要，保证了国家建设的顺利进行。当然，从客观需要来说，我国的农业还显得有些落后，今后还必须用更大的力量加速农业的发展。
    负责人认为产量的提高固然是我国经济方面的重大成就，而工业产品品种的增加也是十分重要的。例如：1952年我国只能生产一百八十多种钢和四百多种规格的钢材，1957年已能生产三百七十多种钢和三千多种规格的钢材；1957年已经能够生产二百多种在解放以前不能生产的新型机床。尤其是，我国现在已经能够制造许多技术要求较高的工业产品，如一千立方公尺的高炉，一百八十五吨的平炉，一万二千瓩的火力发电设备和一万五千瓩的全套水力发电设备，联合采煤机，地质勘探用钻机，载重汽车，喷气式飞机，高效率蒸气机车，四轴自动车床等等。这样，也就在品种方面提高了我国设备和原材料的自给能力。而我国设备和原材料在数量、品种方面的自给能力的加强，就为今后更大规模的经济建设创造了更加有利的条件。
    负责人说，我国第一个五年计划的经济建设和文教建设是密切结合进行的。经济建设推动了文教建设的发展，文教建设又在培养干部、提高科学研究水平、丰富人民文化生活等方面帮助了经济建设的发展。第一个五年计划我国高等学校毕业的学生达到二十七万多人，中等专业学校毕业的学生达到八十四万多人，其中大部分分配到经济各部门和科学研究机关中担负技术方面的工作，大大地加强了我国的科学技术队伍。我国有许多忠心于社会主义事业的科学家，为经济建设作出了很大的贡献。
    负责人指出，在一个占世界陆地面积十三分之一、占世界人口四分之一而原来经济又极端落后的国家里，用短短五年的时间基本上完成了国民经济的社会主义改造，并且建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础，这不能不是一件具有重大意义的事情。这件事情，不仅对于中国本身，而且对于世界和平民主事业，也不能不发生深刻的影响。
    负责人说，在执行第一个五年计划的过程中，帝国主义分子不止一次地说：“中国的五年计划是注定要失败的”，然而在事实面前，这种谎言已经不攻自破。近年以来，帝国主义分子又造出谣言，说什么“中国的五年计划虽然可以完成，但人民生活却是不断降低了”；国内的右派分子也跟着唱和，说什么“五年计划搞坏了”，“统购统销糟透了”等等，对于这些恶意的诬蔑，今年6月周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会上所作的政府工作报告中，已经有力地作了驳斥。这里只举出这样的事实：在第一个五年计划期内，我国就业的职工增加了大约六百五十万人，基本上消灭了旧中国遗留下来的失业现象，并且使绝大多数新增加的城市劳动力得到就业的机会，1957年比1952年，职工的平均工资提高了40％以上，五年内国营企业和国家机关支付劳动保险金、医药费、福利费和文教费达六十多亿元，仅前四年国家拨款建筑的职工住宅达六千六百多万平方公尺。这些都超过了原定的计划。在这期间，由于国家用很大力量促进农业的发展，并且采取了稳定农业税负担的政策，适当提高了农产品的价格，保证了农民收入有所增加，农民生活有了相当的改善。初步计算，1957年比1952年，农民总收入大约提高了30％左右。
    负责人指出，一方面保证国家建设事业的发展，另一方面保证人民生活得到适当的改善，这是我国社会主义建设的一条重要的方针。与此相联系的建设方针是，我国的经济建设一方面必须以重工业为中心，另一方面必须充分注意农业和轻工业的发展，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举。事实证明，由毛主席指出的我国社会主义建设的方针，是完全正确的，在第一个五年计划期间，我们执行了这个方针，因而得到了很大的成就，避免了国民经济各部门——特别是工业和农业之间发生脱节的现象。当然，我们也还有执行得不够的地方，今后还需要继续努力。
    负责人说，在第一个五年计划期间，我们的建设工作和计划工作也发生过一些缺点和错误，但是它们只是属于局部的性质。这一点，除一小撮右派分子不顾事实而加以歪曲以外，全国人民都是了解的。重要的还在于：我们不仅很快地改正了某些缺点和错误，而且从中吸取了经验教训，规定了今后建设的正确方针。例如，在建设中我们曾经发生过同中国实际情况结合不够、有些建设贪大、贪新、对大中小结合和充分利用原有设备注意不够，造成某些浪费，但是，党和政府批评了这些缺点和错误，提出了全面地持久地节约的方针，即勤俭建国和勤俭持家的方针，贯彻执行这个方针，将给我国今后的社会主义建设带来巨大利益。
    负责人说，我们所以能够取得这样伟大的成就，有多方面的原因。在国内，我们有巩固的人民民主专政，有伟大的共产党的领导，有全国人民的一致努力；在国际上，有苏联和人民民主国家在物资、技术和建设经验方面的热情支援，有了他们的支援，使我们减少了许多困难和少走了许多弯路。
    一方面依靠国内广大群众的无穷的力量，又一方面继续加强同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的亲密团结和互助合作，就使我们有可能在比较短的时间内，把我国建成为一个具有现代化工业和现代化农业的社会主义国家。
