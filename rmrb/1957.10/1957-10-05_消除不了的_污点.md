Inerasable "Stain"
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

The entire course of the racist atrocities that occurred in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the United States not long ago proves that the U.S. government has consistently been an encourager and abettor of the rampant activities of racists. It also proves the utter hypocrisy of America's so-called democracy, freedom, and rule of law.

As everyone knows, the U.S. government has consistently condoned and maintained the barbaric system of racial discrimination. The U.S. government's attitude toward the Little Rock atrocity, triggered by the issue of black-white school integration, is the most recent example.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court, under pressure from the domestic population, made a ruling in 1954 to abolish racial segregation in public schools, the southern states have openly resisted. As a result, only 740 of the 9,004 school districts throughout the South have begun to implement black-white integration. Among these, there are instances of integration in name only, or simply admitting one or two black children as a token gesture. The U.S. government has consistently turned a deaf ear and remained aloof to this blatant disregard for the Supreme Court's order. It is precisely because of this attitude of the U.S. government that the racists in the South have become increasingly rampant, and finally staged the Little Rock incident. The Little Rock incident immediately aroused the anger and condemnation of the world's people of justice, but the U.S. government was slow to take effective measures. It was not until the riots had continued for more than twenty days and developed to the point where black children were being beaten that Eisenhower, under the pressure of domestic and international public opinion, had no choice but to send the 101st Airborne Division on September 24 to quell the atrocities.

On the same day, September 24, in his speech justifying the dispatch of federal troops to Little Rock, Eisenhower blatantly boasted that this measure was a "firm attitude" of the U.S. government in implementing the federal court's ruling on the abolition of racial segregation. This is completely self-deceptive. Because, in his speech, he did not condemn the system of racial discrimination at all. And according to his own words, he sent federal troops to Little Rock to "eliminate" the "stain" on America's "reputation," not to solve the domestic racial discrimination problem.

The developments since September 24 continue to prove that the U.S. government is still condoning racists. The very next day, the 25th, the 101st Airborne Division dispatched to Little Rock was withdrawn from Central High School and replaced by the "federalized" Arkansas National Guard. However, it was this same Arkansas National Guard that had beaten black students a few days before. To have a force influenced by racists carry out the task of sanctioning racial discrimination, is this not a ridiculous act of self-deception? The matter does not end there. On the same day, the White House also announced that Eisenhower would negotiate with representatives of the Southern governors on the withdrawal of federal troops. Later, the U.S. Secretary of Defense also stated that federal troops would soon withdraw from Little Rock. It can be seen that the dispatch of federal troops was merely a show to cope with the pressure of public opinion.

In contrast to the U.S. government's repeated concessions to racists, the arrogance of racists is rising step by step. The leader of the Little Rock atrocities, the Governor of Arkansas, openly delivered a televised speech to the nation, opposing the implementation of the Supreme Court's decision. He also threatened to close Central High School in Little Rock to prevent the realization of black-white integration. The racist governors and congressmen of the Southern states also openly clamored to confront the federal government, constantly exerting pressure on the federal government. The U.S. government completely turned a blind eye to all this lawless behavior.

No matter how pretentious the U.S. government may be, the hypocrisy of America's "democracy," "freedom," and "rule of law" cannot be concealed. The Little Rock incident will be recorded in history, forever proving this point.

    消除不了的“污点”
    本报评论员
    不久前在美国阿肯色州小石城发生的种族主义分子暴行事件的全部经过，证明了美国政府一贯是种族主义分子的猖狂活动的鼓励者和纵容者，同时也证明了美国的所谓民主、自由和法治的彻底虚伪性。
    尽人皆知，美国政府一贯纵容和维护野蛮的种族歧视制度，这次美国政府对待因黑白合校问题而引起的小石城暴行事件的态度，是最近的一个实例。
    自从1954年美国最高法院在国内人民的压力下作出在公立学校取消种族隔离的裁决以来，南方各州公开抗拒以致迄今为止在整个南方的九千零四个学校区中，只有七百四十个学校区开始实行黑白合校，其中还有明合暗不合，或者仅仅收一两个黑人儿童做做样子的。对于这种公然违抗最高法院命令的行为，美国政府却始终装聋作哑、袖手不管。正是由于美国政府的这种态度，使得南部的种族主义分子越来越猖獗，而终于演出了这次小石城的事件。在小石城的事件发生之后，立即激起了世界正义人民的愤怒和谴责，但是美国政府却迟迟不采取有效措施，直到暴乱延续了二十多天，发展到黑人儿童被围殴的地步，艾森豪威尔才在国内外舆论的压力下不得不在9月24日派遣一○一空运师前往平息暴行。
    同一天，艾森豪威尔在他为派遣联邦军队到小石城而作的演说中，公然吹嘘说，他的这一措施，是美国政府贯彻联邦法院关于取消种族隔离的裁决的“坚定态度”。这完全是自欺欺人之谈。因为，在他的演说中，他根本没有谴责种族歧视制度。并且照他自己的说法，他派遣联邦军队去小石城，是为了“消除”美国的“名声”所蒙受的“污点”，而不是要解决国内的种族歧视问题。
    9月24日以来的事实的发展，继续证明着美国政府仍然在纵容种族主义分子。就在第二天，25日，派到小石城的一○一空运师就撤离中央中学，而代之以“联邦化”的阿肯色州国民警卫团。但是，在数天前殴打黑人学生的，正是这同一个阿肯色州国民警卫团。让这样一个受种族主义分子影响的部队来执行制裁种族歧视的任务，这岂不是掩耳盗铃的可笑把戏？事情还不止如此。在同一天，白宫还宣布艾森豪威尔将与南方州长的代表谈判撤退联邦军队的问题。后来，美国防部长也表示联邦军队不久将从小石城撤出。可见，派遣联邦部队之举，不过是装装样子以应付舆论的压力而已。
    和美国政府向种族主义分子节节让步相对照的，是种族主义分子的气焰正步步高涨。小石城暴行的首脑、阿肯色州州长公然向全国发表电视演说，反对实施最高法院的决定，他并且威胁要关闭小石城的中央中学，以阻止黑白合校的实现。南方各州的种族主义州长和议员们也公开叫嚣同联邦政府对抗，向联邦政府不断施加压力。对这一切目无法纪的行为，美国政府却完全视若无睹。
    不管美国政府怎样装模作样，美国的“民主”、“自由”和“法治”的虚伪性是掩饰不住的，小石城事件将记载在历史上，永远证明着这一点。
