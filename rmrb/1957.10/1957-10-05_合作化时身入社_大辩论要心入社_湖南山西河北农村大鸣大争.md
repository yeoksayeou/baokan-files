According to the *New Hunan Daily*, a great socialist ideological revolution is unfolding universally and deeply in the rural areas of Hunan Province.

Since August, Hunan Province has launched a large-scale socialist education movement in rural areas. At the beginning of the movement, measures were taken to mobilize the masses to conduct reasoned struggles and to use the support of political and legal departments to crack down on the sabotage activities of illegal landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. This suppressed evil trends, promoted righteousness, and created extremely favorable conditions for carrying out socialist education and conducting large-scale expression of views, and large-scale debates. Then, closely combined with the current grain work, and focusing on the grain issue, a preliminary debate was launched, which to a certain extent raised the ideological awareness of the broad masses of farmers, greatly promoted grain work and autumn production. By September 24, the province had completed 82.22% of its grain purchase task, and a trend of economizing on grain consumption had begun to take shape. Originally, due to the severe drought, it was estimated that only 8 million mu of late rice could be planted. However, through the enthusiastic and redoubled efforts of farmers to fight drought and rush planting, 10.08 million mu were planted. The area planted with coarse grains also exceeded last year by 300,000 mu. Agricultural cooperatives have improved to varying degrees, and the situation in backward cooperatives has also changed greatly.

More importantly: After the previous stage of the movement, extremely favorable conditions have been created for large-scale expression of views and large-scale debates. The broad masses of cadres and people have initially recognized the current situation of the two-road struggle in rural areas and have begun to distinguish between right and wrong. They said, "Physically join the cooperative during cooperation, mentally join the cooperative during socialist education."

In order to further deepen the socialist revolution in politics and ideology, large-scale expression of views and debates were launched in rural areas. In the upper and middle of September, all counties in the province successively convened expanded cadre meetings, with a total of more than 100,000 county, township, and cooperative cadres attending. At the county expanded cadre meetings, a large-scale expression of views was launched, and a large-scale debate was conducted centered on the grain issue. Principles were also used to clarify the rights and wrongs of other issues, such as cooperation, further arming the thinking of cadres.

The vast majority of county expanded cadre meetings concluded in late September. More than 100,000 cadres went to various townships and then convened township and cooperative cadre meetings. In the Xiangtan Special District alone, more than 100,000 cooperative cadres participated in township and cooperative cadre meetings. By the end of September, thirty-five townships had completed their meetings, and meetings in other townships would also be completed in the next few days. After the meeting, the cadres immediately returned to the cooperatives, mobilized the broad masses of people, and continued to launch a deeper large-scale expression of views and debates, still focusing on the grain issue. After thoroughly debating all the major issues of right and wrong on the grain issue, the focus shifted to expressing views and debating around the central work at the time. At the same time, each county used four, five, or even ten cooperatives as key points to carry out a comprehensive expression of views and debates, in order to gain experience. In this way, the movement was comprehensive, with key points and overall considerations, spreading out in an all-round way.

Currently, some township and cooperative cadres have returned to the cooperatives, and responsible comrades from the provincial, local, and county committees have also personally gone deep into the key areas. In these key points and overall areas, a large-scale expression of views has been launched, and some have even turned to large-scale contention and debates. The socialist education movement, which township and cooperative cadres called having "epoch-making significance," has begun more widely and deeply on the basis of the previous stage of the movement!

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th - In Shanxi Province, many areas have already begun to launch an all-people rectification movement in a prepared manner. In the Changzhi and Yuci areas alone, 154 agricultural cooperatives have launched large-scale expression of views and debates.

In order to absorb the experience of the previous stage, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China directly conducted pilot projects and investigations and research in Pingyao, Guo County, and Quwo County, preparing to systematically summarize the experience of these counties to guide the movement throughout the province. Local committees and county committees have also selected typical townships and cooperatives to carry out pilot projects. The Changzhi and Yuci areas, which started earlier, recently convened meetings of the secretaries of the county committees of the Communist Party of China and pilot work meetings, respectively, and, based on the pilot experience of the typical townships and cooperatives, deployed the work of pushing the grain issue debate to a climax after the autumn harvest.

After studying the situation of the pilot cooperatives, the Yuci Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China determined that the content of the large-scale debate should be different for townships and cooperatives in different regions and with different working conditions. For example, the main debate in third-class cooperatives with poor work foundation should be on the superiority of cooperatives; agricultural cooperatives close to cities or industrial and mining areas should mainly debate the relationship between workers and peasants. The Yanbei Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China determined that, in addition to the grain issue, it is also necessary to combine this year's autumn income distribution to clarify the consistency of the interests of the state, the agricultural cooperative, and the members, in order to strengthen the determination of farmers to take the socialist road.

Various localities have taken various forms to cultivate backbones. Up to now, more than 90 cities and counties in the province have trained 600,000 backbone members by using expanded cadre meetings and short-term training sessions. The vast majority of them have initially learned the skills of leading farmers in large-scale debates.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 4th - Hebei Province has successively launched socialist education movements in more than 24,000 villages, of which nearly 10,000 villages have entered the stage of mass expression of views or large-scale debates on the two roads. According to preliminary statistics from thirty-three villages in seven counties, including Longyao and Shahe, farmers have already put forward more than 14,000 correct criticisms and opinions.

From September 22 to 27, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a reporting meeting of the leaders of the twenty key rectification work groups in the province and absorbed the responsible persons of the rectification leading groups in various regions to summarize and analyze the work of these key points in order to absorb experience and guide the entire movement.

The work of these twenty key rectification work groups proves that only by mobilizing the masses for a thorough and comprehensive expression of views, and then turning to clarifying major issues of right and wrong, can the purpose of rectification be achieved. Experience shows that large-scale expression of views is the first step to victory, and debate is the decisive key. Therefore, before the expression of views turns to debate, we should carefully analyze the opinions of the masses, make explanations, and at the same time conduct training and rectification of the backbone team, and clarify the topics of the debate.

    合作化时身入社  大辩论要心入社
    湖南山西河北农村大鸣大争
    据新湖南报消息　湖南省农村中的伟大社会主义思想革命，正在普遍深入展开。
    从8月份以来，湖南省各地在农村中开展了大规模的社会主义教育运动。运动一开始，即采取发动群众进行说理斗争和政法部门支援的办法，打击了不法地主、富农和反革命分子的破坏活动，压倒了歪风，伸张了正气，为开展社会主义教育、进行大鸣大放大争创造了极为有利的条件。接着，紧密结合当时的粮食工作并围绕着粮食问题展开了初步的辩论，在一定程度上提高了广大农民的思想觉悟，大大地推动了粮食工作和秋季生产。到9月24日止，全省征购任务已完成82.22％，节约用粮的风气也开始形成，许多农民订出了用粮计划。原来因旱情严重估计只能种八百万亩晚稻，经农民们热情百倍地抗旱抢种，结果种了一千零八十万亩，杂粮种植面积也超过去年三十万亩。农业社有了不同程度的提高，落后社的情况也大为改变。
    尤为重要的是：经过前一段运动后为大鸣大放大争创造了极为有利的条件。广大干部和群众初步地认识了当前农村两条道路斗争的形势，开始明辨了是非，他们说：“合作化人入社，社会主义教育心入社”。
    为了进一步深入进行政治上、思想上的社会主义革命，在农村中展开了大鸣大放大争。全省各县于9月上、中旬先后召开了扩大干部会议，出席会议的县、乡、社三级干部共十多万人。在县扩大干部会议上展开了大鸣大放，以粮食问题为中心进行了大辩大争，在其他如合作化等问题上也原则上划清了是非，进一步武装了干部思想。
    绝大多数的县扩大干部会议在9月下旬已经结束，十多万干部分赴各乡，紧接着召开了乡社干部会议。仅湘潭专区，参加乡社干部会议的社干部就有十万人以上。9月底已有三十五个乡开完了会议，其他乡的会议也都将在最近几天内开完。会后，干部随即回社，发动广大群众仍然围绕着粮食问题，更深入地大鸣大放大争。在把粮食问题上的大是大非全部辩透以后，再围绕当时的中心工作展开鸣放和争辩。同时，各县以四、五个以至十来个社作重点，进行全面鸣放和争辩，以便取得经验。这样运动就有点有面，点面结合的全面铺开了。
    目前，已有部分乡、社干部回到合作社，省委、各地、县委的负责同志也已亲自深入重点。在这些点上和面上，都已经展开了大鸣大放，有的还转入了大争大辩。被乡社干部称为有“划时代意义”的社会主义教育运动，已经在前一段运动的基础上更广泛更深入地开始了！
    新华社太原4日电　山西省农村已经有不少地区开始有准备地展开全民性整风运动。仅长治、榆次两个地区，就有一百五十四个农业社展开了大鸣大放大争。
    为了吸取前一阶段的经验，中共山西省委在平遥、崞县和曲沃等县直接作了试点和调查研究工作，准备系统总结这些县的经验来指导全省的运动。各地委、县委也都选择了典型乡、社，开展了试点工作。动手较早的长治和榆次地区，最近分别召开了中共县委书记会议和试点工作会议，根据典型乡、社的试点经验，部署了秋后把粮食问题大辩论推向高潮的工作。
    中共榆次地委在研究了试点社的情况后，确定不同地区和不同工作条件的乡、社进行大辩论时应有不同的内容。例如，工作基础不好的三类社，主要辩论合作社优越性问题；靠近城市或工矿区的农业社主要辩论工农关系。中共雁北地委确定，除粮食问题外，还要结合今年秋季收益分配，辨明国家、农业社、社员三者利益一致性的问题，以坚定农民走社会主义道路的决心。
    各地采取多种形式培养了骨干。到目前为止，全省九十多个市、县利用扩大干部会议和短期集训的方式，训练了六十万个骨干分子。他们绝大部分都初步学会了领导农民大辩论的本领。
    据新华社保定4日电　河北省已经在两万四千多个乡村里先后展开社会主义教育运动，其中有近万个乡村已经进入群众性的大鸣大放或两条道路的大辩论。据隆尧、沙河等七个县三十三个村的初步统计，农民群众提出的正确批评和意见已经有一万四千多件。
    中共河北省委在9月22日到27日，召开了全省二十个整风重点工作组组长并吸收各地委整风领导小组负责人参加的汇报会议，总结和分析了这些重点的工作，以便吸取经验，指导整个运动。
    这二十个整风重点工作组的工作证明：只有发动群众彻底的全面的大鸣大放，然后转向明辨大是大非，才能达到整风的目的。经验说明，大鸣大放是取得胜利的第一步，而辩论是决定关键。所以在鸣放转向辩论之前，应该认真分析群众的意见，作出交代，同时进行骨干队伍的训练和整顿，明确辩论的课题。
