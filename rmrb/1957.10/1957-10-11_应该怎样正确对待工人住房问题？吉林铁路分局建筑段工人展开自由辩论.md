How Should Workers' Housing Problems Be Correctly Addressed?
　　Workers of the Jilin Railway Branch Construction Section Conduct a Free Debate

According to the Jilin Daily, workers of the Jilin Railway Branch Construction Section launched a free debate on the issue of workers' housing.

Should Housing Be Solely the Responsibility of the State?

During the period of "Great Blooming and Contending," workers raised nearly two thousand opinions, a considerable number of which concerned housing. Worker Zhang Lu said: "Solving the housing problem must rely on the state, because the higher authorities serve the people. If we don't rely on them, who do we rely on?" Worker Liu Xiying said: "Relying on the state to solve housing is right. Look at those large buildings built by the Railway Bureau, which one was paid for by individuals? Which of the simple residences were paid for by individuals? Aren't they all from the state?" Worker Liu Zhongfu even said to the section's cadres: "I'll give you three days to solve my housing problem. If you don't, I won't come to work."

After the issue was brought up, the workers all expressed their personal views, and some even wrote big-character posters. Li Zhonghou said: "It is wrong to rely entirely on the state to solve housing problems. Our country is still very poor and has a weak foundation. Money is limited, and we still have to build socialism. If we all rely on the state to solve housing problems, the state shouldn't build socialism and should just build houses. The difficulties of the state are our own difficulties. We must take the lead in overcoming them. In fact, the state takes very good care of us, building both apartment buildings and residences. But we have many employees, and we can't solve it all at once. If there are problems that can't be solved, individuals must also think of a solution and can't rely entirely on the state, lying on the state's back." Then, he made a comparison: "Who cared about us workers in the past? Look at now, we are content." Worker Zhang Guifu said: "State construction is planned, and we can't put down production to just build houses; if we do that, it's bad for the country and bad for individuals." Liu Hai said: "I am a fifty-year-old worker. When I worked under the Japanese puppet regime, let alone not working, even taking a break would get you beaten. Once, I was building bricks on scaffolding, and because I was a little slow, I was knocked down from the scaffolding by a 'Japanese devil' with a stick. Now we are the masters of the country, the leading class, working for ourselves. If we encounter some difficulties and don't work, I think that's wrong and a mistake." After the debate, the issue was clarified, and the conclusion was: Solving the housing problem should not rely entirely on the state, and we must first develop production and gradually solve the housing problem. After the debate, Liu Zhongfu also improved his understanding and voluntarily signed up to build a simple residence.

In Allocating Houses, Should Cadres and Party Members Be Prioritized Over Workers?

In the allocation of houses, many workers raised concerns. They said that the allocation of houses was unreasonable and that cadres and Party members were given priority. Worker Zhang Lu said: "When Party members and cadres don't have houses, they get them. When 'ordinary workers' ask for houses, they have to wait for years without a solution. Isn't this the same as in the past, with cadres and Party members prioritized?" Tian Wanxing said: "The higher authorities care about the cadres and don't care about the workers, solving housing problems with cadres first." Some workers also agreed with this view.

In the debate, workers refuted this view based on what they had seen and heard. Li Huaxiang said: "The idea that cadres and Party members are prioritized in allocating houses, I don't think that's based on facts. Not to mention the distant past, let's talk about the recent past. Our Section Chief Liang has three generations, nine people living on one kang. Section Chief Liang felt uncomfortable and slept at the club. According to the conditions, he has been working for more than ten years, and his family can't live together, he is a Party member and a cadre, but he has never asked for a house. Our section's Wang Zongshan is also a Party member. His family lives in a thatched house that leaks when it rains, and he has not asked for a house. Can we say that Party members and cadres are prioritized?" Han Zaixing said: "Now the allocation of houses is studied by the sections, evaluated by everyone. The condition for evaluation is comparison, finding out who is the most difficult. We don't ask who is a Party member and who is a cadre. If Party members and cadres are prioritized, then we don't need to evaluate. Whoever is a Party member or a cadre gets it first. So I think this view is not based on facts."

After presenting these facts, Liu Xiying said: "In the allocation of houses, some places are not very reasonable, but we can't say that it's because of who has priority. We can't say that the Party's policy is skewed. The ten fingers are not all the same length, so how can there be no shortcomings? If there are shortcomings, we must correct them. Isn't the current rectification campaign to correct shortcomings?" After everyone's debate, the understanding was unified, and Zhang Lu had nothing to say.

Is the State's Depreciation Purchase of Self-Built, Publicly Assisted Housing an Act of Exploitation?

In order to take care of the workers' lives, the state once bought back the self-built, publicly assisted simple residences that were about to collapse at the original price with a depreciation of 6.3%. However, some workers did not understand this care and had misunderstandings, not only not expressing gratitude but also saying that the state was exploiting them. For example, worker Li Xianjie said: "The house was built with personal money and personal labor. The state's purchase is no different from that of capitalists." As soon as he finished speaking, many workers spoke one after another, refuting this statement with their own experiences. They said, "How can this be compared with capitalists? Our houses are about to collapse, and the workers can't afford to repair them. The state buys them back to avoid losses for the workers. Isn't this taking care of our lives? Would capitalists buy our broken houses in the past? My family used to have a house that was falling apart. The capitalists didn't buy it, but confiscated it. Isn't this a good comparison?" Li Zhonghou calculated several accounts to help Li Xianjie understand whether the state's purchase of the house meant that workers were losing out or gaining. Li Zhonghou said: "From the 132 houses repaired by our section, the average purchase price by the state is 271 yuan, and the state spends an average of 7 yuan and 8 jiao per meter in major repairs. After the repairs, they are rented back to the original residents. The monthly rent for 132 houses is more than 650 yuan, but the state spends more than 1,530 yuan each month on major repairs and maintenance. You see, is the state losing out, or is it benefiting?" After the debate, Li Xianjie's thinking was straightened out. He said, "The 'sand pot' won't leak unless it's broken. This time, my 'sand pot' is broken. The problem is clarified. I shouldn't forget my roots and forget the benefits the Communist Party has given me."

Through the debate on the above issues, the workers' thinking was basically corrected. Their understanding was unified, misunderstandings were eliminated, and both workers and cadres were educated.

　　应该怎样正确对待工人住房问题？
　　吉林铁路分局建筑段工人展开自由辩论
    据吉林日报消息　吉林铁路分局建筑段的工人，就工人的住房问题展开了自由辩论。
    住房应否完全由国家负责解决？
    在大鸣大放的时候，工人提出将近二千条意见，其中关于房子问题占相当数量。工人张禄说：“解决房子问题必须依靠国家，因为上级是为人民服务的，不依靠它依靠谁？”工人刘锡英说：“解决房子依靠国家就对了，你看铁路局盖的那些大楼哪个是个人掏了腰包，盖的简易住宅哪个是个人拿了钱？还不都是国家吗？”工人刘忠富竟对段上的干部说：“限你三天给我解决房子，不解决我就不上班”。
    问题摆开以后，工人们都发表了个人的看法，有的还写了大字报。李忠厚说：解决房子完全依靠国家是不对的，我们的国家目前还很穷、底子薄，钱有限，还要建设社会主义呢。如果都依靠国家解决，国家就不要建设社会主义了，就光搞房子吧。国家的困难，也就是我们自己的困难，我们要带头克服，其实，国家对我们照顾的很好，又盖楼房，又盖住宅，可是我们员工多，不能一下子全解决，有解决不了的，个人也得想个办法，不能全依靠国家，躺在国家身上。接着，他又对比的说：过去谁管咱们工人呀！看看现在，我们就满足了。工人张贵福说：国家建设是有计划的，不能放下生产光搞房子；要这样，对国家不利，对个人也没好处。刘海说：我是五十岁的老工人，在伪满干活，别说不干，就是歇歇气都得挨打，有一次，我在脚手架上砌砖，因为慢了一点，就被“小鬼子”一棒子打倒在架子上。现在我们是国家的主人，是领导阶级，给自己干活，有点困难就不干活，我看不对，是错误的。经过辩论，问题弄清了，结论是：解决房子问题不应该全依靠国家，而且要先发展生产，逐步解决住宅问题。经过辩论，刘忠富也提高了认识，主动报名要求盖简易住宅。
    在分配房子时，是否先干部和党员而后工人？
    在房子分配上，有不少工人提出了意见。他们说房子分配不合理，是干部党员优先。工人张禄说：当党员当干部的没有房子就解决，当“小工”的要求好几年都不给解决，这不是和过去一样，干部党员优先吗？田万兴说：上级对干部关心，对工人不关心，解决房子先紧干部。有的工人也同意这种说法。
    在辩论中，工人们都根据自己所见所闻，辩驳了这种说法。李华祥说：分配房子是干部、党员优先，我看是没有根据。远的不比，说近的吧，咱们梁段长，家里有老少三辈子九口人在一个炕上住。梁段长觉着不方便，到俱乐部来睡觉。要按条件他入路十几年了，家里又住不下，是党员又是干部，可是他从来没要过房子。咱们段的王宗山也是党员，他家住的是草房，下雨哗哗漏，他也没有要过房子，这能说是党员、干部优先吗？韩再兴说：现在分配房子是分段研究，大家评定，评的条件是比，打听哪个人困难，困难当中挑最困难的，我们没有打听哪个是党员、哪个是干部，如果党员、干部优先，那就不要评定了。谁是党员、干部就先给谁了。所以我看这种说法是没有根据的。
    摆出这些事实后，刘奚英说：在分配房子上有的地方是不太合理，但不是说是谁优先，不能说是党的政策歪了，十个手指头还不一般齐呢，哪能没有缺点，有缺点就要改嘛，这次整风不就是要改正缺点吗。大伙辩论之后认识统一了，张禄也没有话讲了。
    国家折旧收买自建公助的住宅，是不是剥削行为？
    为了照顾工人的生活，国家曾把快要坍塌的自建公助的简易住宅，按原价折旧6.3％收买回来。可是有的工人没有理解这种照顾，产生了误解，不仅不表示感激，反而说国家剥削了他。如工人李宪结说：房子是用个人的钱，个人的工盖起来的，国家收买和资本家没有两样。他刚说完，很多工人都争先恐后地发了言，用自己的切身体验，驳斥了这种说法。他们说，这怎么能和资本家相比呢？我们的房子眼看要倒了，工人自己修理不起，国家收买回来，免得工人受损失，这不是照顾我们的生活吗？过去资本家能买咱们的破房子吗？我们家过去有一间房子，东倒西歪的了，资本家不是买，而是给没收了，这不是很好的对比吗？李忠厚为了帮助李宪结弄清国家收买房子，工人是吃亏还是占便宜，就算了几笔账。李忠厚说：从咱们分段所维修的一百三十二栋房子来看，平均每栋国家收买价格是二百七十一元，国家在大修的时候，一米平均花七元八角钱。修好以后，再租给原住户，一百三十二栋房子，每个月收租是六百五十多元，可是国家每个月花在大修、维修方面的钱就是一千五百三十多元，你们看，是国家吃亏，还是占便宜？辩论以后，李宪结的思想搞通了，他说，“砂锅”不打不漏，这回我的“砂锅”打漏了，问题弄清了，我不应该忘本、忘了共产党给我的好处。
    通过上述问题的辩论，基本上端正了工人的思想。他们的认识统一了，误解消除了，工人和干部都受到了教育。
