Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 18th: Many organs and groups in Sichuan Province have solved problems that have not been solved for a long time during the process of rectification while correcting mistakes.

How to manage joint clinics is a long-standing unresolved issue for the Department of Health. In the past, the Department of Health had conducted investigations and studies on this issue, but because it involved a wide range of issues and some specific problems were difficult to solve, a unified management method was not formulated for a long time. This resulted in poor management of some joint clinics, which affected the enthusiasm of the joint clinic members. This time, the Department of Health, based on the opinions put forward by the masses during the free airing of views and the actual situation, conducted repeated studies and recently drafted the "Provisional Measures for the Organization and Management of Joint Clinics in Sichuan Province." It clearly stipulates the nature, tasks, management principles, composition of personnel, distribution of income, and handling of public accumulation funds of joint clinics, so that this long-standing unresolved problem has been solved, and the masses have responded well.

After the Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera Troupe went through the free airing of views, it was found that the training of young actors was an important problem that had long existed in the troupe. During this rectification movement, the leaders of the troupe, based on the opinions put forward by the masses, decided to conduct an artistic appraisal of all young actors in the troupe who have not yet been artistically finalized and lack foundation this year to help them correctly understand their own advantages and disadvantages and correctly embark on a path that is conducive to their artistic development. The troupe has now assigned someone to prepare for this work.

During the free airing of views, the Sichuan Provincial People's Procuratorate found that the Procuratorial Committee of the院 had never held a meeting since its establishment at the end of 1956, and its functions were replaced by the院务会议. This problem has not been resolved for a long time due to the leadership's lack of attention. After the start of the rectification movement, the staff of the院 expressed their opinions on this issue, which aroused the attention of the leadership. On October 8, the Procuratorate held its first Procuratorial Committee meeting. At the meeting, the leaders of the Procuratorate reviewed the shortcomings of their past lack of attention to this work, discussed the future work tasks of the Procuratorial Committee, and stipulated a system of holding a meeting once a month. At the first meeting, they also studied and worked out solutions to two complex and long-delayed cases.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th: Public-private joint venture commercial enterprises in Guangdong Province have been or are adjusting the bloated and overlapping administrative institutions appropriately. In the past, administrative staff accounted for 15% to 40% of the total number of people in the enterprise, but now they only account for 5% to 15%. This is what Yang Yi, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Commerce, told the heads of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association. On the 14th, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee invited people from the industrial and commercial circles to hold a forum, and the heads of the relevant departments reported to them on the government's handling of the opinions raised by people from the industrial and commercial circles during the "big blooming and contending."

Dai Xiong, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Industry, Wang Hongzhang, Deputy Director of the Foreign Trade Bureau, and Zhou Cai, Deputy Director of the Transportation Department, all cited facts to illustrate the achievements of public-private joint venture enterprises, pointing out the existing shortcomings and improvement methods. The total output value of public-private joint venture industry in the province increased by 25% in 1956 compared with 1955, the quality of products has been improved, and the management and working conditions of enterprises have been continuously improved, all of which show the superiority of joint venture industrial enterprises. The opinions put forward by people from the industrial and commercial circles on foreign trade joint venture enterprises, automobile transportation industry, and joint venture industrial enterprises have been handled or are being handled. Someone reflected that the board of directors of the Hainan Automobile General Station was unsound. This opinion has been adopted, and the board of directors has been reorganized. Some people suggested that the work arrangements of several private personnel such as Lin Tianqiang and Huang Wenyuan were not appropriate. After investigation by relevant departments, it was found to be true and has now been adjusted.

　　四川许多机关团体狠狠整改
    解决了长期没解决的问题
    广东公私合营企业大力减少行政管理人员
    新华社成都18日电  四川省许多机关和团体在边整边改中解决了长期没有解决的问题。
    如何管理联合诊所是卫生厅一个长期悬而未决的问题。过去卫生厅曾经对这个问题进行了调查研究，但因为它牵涉面广，有些具体问题很难解决，以致长期没有订出统一管理办法，使部分联合诊所管理得不好，影响了联合诊所成员的积极性。卫生厅这次根据鸣放中群众提出的意见和实际情况，进行了反复的研究，最近拟出了“四川省联合诊所组织管理暂行办法”。对联合诊所的性质、任务、管理原则、人员组成、收入分配及公积金处理等方面都作了明确的规定，使这个长期悬而未决的问题得到了解决，群众反映很好。
    四川省川剧院经过鸣放以后，发现对青年演员的培养工作是剧院长期存在的一个重要问题。这次整风中，剧院领导上根据群众所提的意见，决定在今年内对院内所有艺术上尚未定型和基础不足的青年演员，进行一次艺术上的鉴定，帮助他们正确认识自己的优点和缺点，正确地走向有利于自己艺术发展的道路。现在剧院已抽出专人筹备这一工作。
    四川省人民检察院在鸣放中，发现这个院的检察委员会从1956年底成立后，从未召开过一次会议，而由院务会议代替了它的职权。这个问题由于领导上不重视，很久没有解决。整风开始以后，院内工作人员对这个问题提出意见，引起了领导上的注意。10月8日检察院召开了第一次检察委员会会议，会上，检察院的领导人检讨了过去对这一工作重视不够的缺点，并讨论了今后检察委员会的工作任务，规定了每月召开一次会议的制度。在第一次会上，并对两个复杂而拖延较久的案件，研究出了处理的办法。
    据新华社广州18日电  广东省各公私合营商业企业，已经或正在对臃肿重叠的行政机构，进行适当的调整。过去行政管理人员占企业中总人数的15％到40％，现在只占5％到15％。这是广东省商业厅厅长杨毅向省工商联、民建会负责人所谈的话。广东省人民委员会14日邀请工商界人士举行座谈会，各有关部门负责人向他们报告了政府对工商界人士在大鸣大放时所提意见的处理情况。
    广东省工业厅副厅长戴雄、对外贸易局副局长王鸿章和交通厅副厅长周材等，都列举事实说明了公私合营企业的成绩，指出存在的缺点和改进办法。全省公私合营工业产值1956年比1955年增长了25％，产品质量有所提高，企业的经营管理和劳动条件不断改善，这些都显示出合营工业企业的优越性。工商界人士对于对外贸易合营企业、汽车运输业、合营工业企业所提出的意见，有的已经处理，有的正在处理。有人反映海南汽车总站董事会不健全，这个意见已被采纳，董事会已经重新改组。有人提出私方人员林天强、黄文远等几人的工作安排不够适当，经过有关部门调查属实，现已作了调整。
