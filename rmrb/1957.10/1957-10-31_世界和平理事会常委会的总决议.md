Despite growing public opposition to the policy of strength, this policy continues to be implemented throughout the world. Because this policy refuses to stop the continued testing of more destructive weapons, it causes deep unease, it is an encouragement to continue colonialism and the use of violence against colonial peoples, and it causes brutal wars to suppress colonies. It is the cause of depriving the right to self-determination, and the cause of interfering in the internal affairs of many countries. It deepens divisions. It has created the existence of military blocs and exacerbated the division of the world.

The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, meeting in Stockholm on October 28, 1957, in accordance with the unwavering principles of the peace movement, calls on the forces of peace to remain vigilant and work to move the world away from this dangerous path.

In the Middle East, Syria, like Egypt not long ago, is being threatened by military intervention, which could turn some fabricated event into a world-scale war. All acts of interference in the sovereignty and independence of the peoples of this region must cease immediately. The shipment of weapons to countries in this region should be stopped under the supervision of the United Nations.

In Africa and elsewhere, the desire of colonial peoples for freedom and the right to self-determination must be fully satisfied. In Algeria, France should immediately take steps to end the war and open the way for negotiations in order to resolve the issues raised by historical development in a manner that is in the best, true interests of both the Algerian and French peoples.

National sovereignty must be respected everywhere, and all attempts to infringe upon sovereignty by establishing foreign military bases or signing economic agreements that benefit only certain countries must cease.

In Europe, the main danger is the revival of German militarism and the decision to equip its army with nuclear weapons; therefore, efforts should be made to organize a security system with the participation of all countries. The withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in the two Germanys and the abolition of foreign bases on their territory would help the two Germanys reach an agreement on arms reduction, which would pave the way for the establishment of a security zone and promote Germany's much-desired unification. In the spirit of Poland's recent proposal to the United Nations, it would be beneficial to reach an agreement between the two Germanys, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, even if limited to the issue of nuclear weapons and the storage of atomic bombs.

Experience shows that the participation of the People's Republic of China and its prestige are necessary to solve world problems. The People's Republic of China must enjoy its rightful place in the United Nations.

Taking such preliminary steps is possible in all respects. This fact must be recognized in order to make these steps possible. The World Peace Council will support all efforts in this direction, regardless of where they come from.

To stop the gradual poisoning of the world by radioactive substances, the nuclear arms race must be stopped. Reaching an agreement in this regard will help create an atmosphere conducive to resolving the long-delayed problem of large-scale general disarmament. The people of all countries are becoming increasingly anxious about the consequences of the arms race, which greatly increases the danger of war and wastes resources essential for human progress, greatly reducing living standards. But new scientific inventions and recent achievements have offered the world a prospect of prosperity and happiness hitherto undreamed of. To enjoy this prospect, the obstacles that divide the world must be removed: hostility and misunderstanding. Today, the people of all countries are more clearly aware of this than ever before. Therefore, they desire peaceful coexistence, and they hope to finally usher in a new era of economic, scientific, and cultural cooperation among nations. The mutual distrust that still exists between major powers is a huge obstacle. The heads of all major powers have a special responsibility to avoid the dangers arising from their disagreements, and they must meet.

The World Peace Council calls on all peace-loving people around the world to do their part to demand such a meeting, so that public opinion generates an atmosphere of understanding that will help make this meeting a success.

    世界和平理事会常委会的总决议
    尽管公众愈来愈反对实力政策，这个政策却仍然在世界各地执行。由于本着这个政策拒绝停止继续试验更具破坏性的武器，这个政策引起了深刻的不安，它是继续实施殖民主义和对殖民地人民使用暴力的一种鼓励，并且引起了镇压殖民地的野蛮战争。它是剥夺自决权利的原因，是干涉许多国家内政的原因。它加深了分歧。它造成了军事集团的存在，加剧了世界的分裂。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会1957年10月28日在斯德哥尔摩举行会议，根据和平运动的不可动摇的原则，号召和平力量保持警惕和努力使世界离开这一危险的道路。
    在中东，叙利亚也和不久以前的埃及一样，正受到军事干涉的威胁，这种干涉可能把某种制造出来的事件转变成一场世界规模的大战。干涉这个地区各国人民的主权和独立的一切行为必须立即停止。应该在联合国的监督下停止向这个地区的国家运送武器。
    在非洲和其他地方，殖民地人民要求自由和自决权利的愿望必须完全得到满足。在阿尔及利亚，法国应该立即采取步骤来结束战争和打开谈判的道路，以便在符合阿尔及利亚人民和法国人民双方的最大的、真正的利益的情况下解决历史发展所提出的问题。
    国家主权在各处都必须受到尊重，一切企图以建立外国军事基地或签订仅仅有利于某些国家的经济协定来侵犯主权的尝试都必须停止。
    在欧洲，主要危险是德国军国主义的复活和以核武器装备其军队的决定，因此，应该努力组织一个有一切国家参加的安全体系。驻在两个德国的外国军队如果撤出，在它们领土上的外国基地如果撤销，这将有助于两个德国就裁减军备达成协议，这将为建立安全区铺平道路，这将促进德国实现十分向往的统一。根据波兰最近在联合国所提出的建议的精神，在两个德国、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰之间达成即使是仅仅局限于核武器和储存原子弹问题的协议，那也是有好处的。
    经验表明，中华人民共和国的参加和它的威信对解决世界问题是必要的。中华人民共和国必须享有它在联合国内的应有地位。
    采取这种初步的步骤在一切方面都是可能的。必须要承认这一事实，以便可能实现这些步骤。世界和平理事会将支持不管来自那一方面的朝着这个方向的一切努力。
    要制止放射性物质逐渐毒化世界，必须停止原子核竞赛。在这方面达成协议将有助于创造一种有利于解决始终拖延不决的大规模普遍裁军问题的气氛。各国人民对于军备竞赛的后果是愈来愈感到焦急了，军备竞赛大大地加剧战争危险和浪费人类进步所必不可少的资源，大大地减低生活水平。但是科学上的新发明和最近的成就向世界提供了一种迄今没有梦想到的繁荣和幸福的前景。要享受这种前途，必须消除使世界陷于分裂的障碍：敌意和误解。今天各国人民比以前任何时候更清楚地认识到这一点。因此他们希望和平共处，他们希望终于揭开一个各国在经济上、科学上和文化上进行合作的新时期。大国之间仍旧存在的互不信任是巨大的障碍。一切大国的元首负有特别的责任，应该避免因他们意见不一致而产生的危险，他们必须会晤。
    世界和平理事会要求全世界一切拥护和平的人士尽他们的力量要求举行这样一种会议，使舆论产生一种有助于使这种会议获得成功的谅解气氛。
