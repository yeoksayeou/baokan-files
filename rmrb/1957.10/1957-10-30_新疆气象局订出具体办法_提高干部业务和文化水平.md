The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Meteorological Bureau has formulated specific measures to improve the professional and cultural levels of its cadres.

The Meteorological Bureau has many cadres transferred from the military. Due to their relatively low cultural level and lack of understanding of meteorology as a science, they face difficulties in their work. In the past, they repeatedly requested opportunities to study technology and culture. This year, in July, when all the heads of meteorological stations and posts in Xinjiang came to Urumqi for rectification, they raised this request again. The leadership of the Meteorological Bureau accepted this suggestion and formulated measures to improve the professional and cultural levels of cadres. A cultural class and a professional rotational training class were established in Qitai County, allowing station heads, post chiefs, observers, radio operators, and others to concentrate on studying in shifts. At the same time, more than 40 technicians with longer work experience were sent to secondary specialized schools in Beijing and Chengdu for further study.

    新疆气象局订出具体办法
    提高干部业务和文化水平
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区气象局订出具体办法，提高干部的业务和文化水平。
    气象局有许多从部队转业的干部，由于文化水平较低，不懂气象这门科学，工作困难。过去他们一再要求学习技术和文化，今年7月，全疆气象台台长和站长到乌鲁木齐整风，又提出这一要求。气象局领导上接受了这一意见，制定出提高干部业务和文化水平的办法，在奇台县成立了文化班和业务轮训班，让台长、站长、观测员、报务员等轮流地集中学习。同时，还遣送了工作年限较久的技术员四十多人到北京和成都中等专业学校学习。
