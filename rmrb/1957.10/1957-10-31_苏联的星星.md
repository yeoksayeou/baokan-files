    Soviet Stars
    Ma Jia
    The Soviet Union has successfully launched the world's first artificial Earth satellite. It is the most precious gift dedicated to the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. It has created a new era of science, realized mankind's dream of many years, revealed the secrets of the universe, and decorating it with praise like a rainbow does not seem like an exaggeration. A magical bird has brought the gospel of peace to all mankind.
    One night, I turned on the radio and heard the signal from the artificial Earth satellite broadcast by Beijing Radio Station, da da da... I don't understand its code, but I am familiar with its sound, so beautiful, so impassioned, so rhythmic and full of emotion, a triumphant song of marching towards the universe, a song of victory! From workers beside Martin furnaces to children under rubber trees, all cheer for it. Only the masters in the Pentagon, self-intoxicated with power politics, showed shock. An American congressman could not help but sigh, "Artificial satellites may completely change the concept of war."
    Forty years ago, the "Aurora" ship in St. Petersburg shelled the Winter Palace, and the world's first socialist country appeared, which completely changed the concept of war. It buried the Tsar's butcher knife, tore up the traitorous treaty of the Kerensky government, and announced the decree of peace. Peace is a sacred name, the loudest denunciation to imperialist warmongers, making mankind no longer a sacrifice of science, but the master of science.
    Socialism has liberated the people, giving them a wisdom of science and art, constantly creating miracles. Valery Chkalov, a Soviet hero, pioneered the world's long-distance air route. Like a divine eagle, he explored the Arctic Circle and reached the Americas, becoming the Columbus of the 20th century. Another Soviet hero, Alexei Maresyev, had his legs taken away by the war, but the revolution gave him a stronger will. He was able to complete seven combat flights in one day and shot down two German aircraft. This is truly a miracle, a miracle that has been recorded in the epic "A Real Man." It is Polevoi who understands Maresyev's soul, not imperialist warmongers. Goering gloomily said at the Nuremberg trial, "We don't know or understand the Soviets," this is the lament of the Nazis, and it is somewhat true. Hitler and Goering in the past did not understand the Soviets, and Eisenhower and Dulles today also do not understand the Soviets.
    Recently, American warmongers have supported Turkey's provocation on the Syrian border, and American flagships and aircraft carrier groups have sailed to the Mediterranean. It is not difficult to imagine the insatiable ambition of the oil king Rockefeller. That greedy ambition is like the saliva flowing from a viper, flowing from the Mississippi River all the way to the Persian Gulf. The people wearing American naval officer uniforms on the flagship are stained with the gunpowder smell of doing oil business. What about the other side of the Caucasus Mountains? The Soviet Caspian Sea is full of steel frames of oil derricks like a forest, but the coast near Baku is a splendid park. In November, white chrysanthemums, red cannas, and purple cockscomb flowers are still in full bloom. The sea breeze gently blows, lifting the red scarves of young girls, revealing their black hair. Every Azerbaijani girl carries a calm and confident pace. Their lives have youth, sea, and peace.
    Every Soviet loves the mountains and rivers of their motherland, and this is a force that changes the concept of war into the concept of peace. The scene of peace is full of poetry. Why does Lake Baikal give people a deep and mysterious feeling? Why is the Angara River so clear and bright? Why is the Volga River so vast and majestic? And why is the night on the banks of the Moscow River so brilliantly lit? Is it because of the red stars on the Kremlin shining? Red ruby stars! The lighthouse of the world's working class, the lighthouse of the liberation of all mankind, without your shining, who knows how many years history would be dark.
    The first time I saw the red stars on the Kremlin was on the eve of the October Revolution Day in 1951. I lived in the Moscow Grand Hotel, facing the Council of Ministers Building, opposite Red Square. Whenever I went to the eighth floor of the hotel and lifted the curtains, the red stars on the Kremlin's spire flashed out like fireballs, magical, mysterious, with an incredible brilliance, breaking through the hazy white mist, shining with that radiating red power, red and transparent, the halo pulsating, showing everything to those who pursue truth, how ecstatic I was! The red star of the revolutionary holy land, the eternal red star, a red star of human liberation!
    I will never forget the ocean of red flags flooding Red Square that October, swaying, surging, and undulating. The storm of salutes and cheers swept Red Square, and a powerful working-class team emerged from under the red stars, which no force could stop. At night, towering fireworks were lit in Red Square, dazzling, colorful, like a rainbow thrown into the sky, tens of thousands of rockets reaching the sky. Science is not a dream. Six years later today, the Soviet Union's artificial Earth satellite proudly appeared in space. It has more brilliance and more poetry than fireworks.
    Also six years ago today, I visited the Leningrad Zhdanov Children's Palace, which was decorated with extraordinary beauty, magnificence, and splendor, comparable to a palace, but the masters of this world were the Young Pioneers who had been baptized by Lenin and wore red scarves. Thousands of Young Pioneers were lively, healthy, intelligent, and full of an optimistic emotion, with knowledge beyond their age. There are cars, steamboats, machine tools, and trains for testing. They are no longer companions of toys, but skilled drivers. Next to the machines is an atomic energy manufacturing model. Obviously, atomic energy is no longer a secret to Soviet Young Pioneers wearing red scarves.
    People who pursue light are fundamentally different from those who play with fire. Beacon fire also has light, but it is a light of disaster, a light of destruction, a light of death. Those who play with fire often burn themselves. Napoleon set fire to Moscow and ended his dynastic fate. Hitler first set fire to the Reichstag, arousing the anger of the world's working class; the second time he set fire to Stalingrad, and this historically famous Tsaritsyn became the tomb of the German bandits. The fire-playing demon will never understand: the flames you spewed melted the asphalt roads of Stalingrad, but today marble hero monuments stand, rubble is paved with granite, and victory parks with tree-lined roads are built. According to the laws of history, victory always belongs to the heroes who pursue the light.
    Soviet stars, the light of mankind.

    苏联的星星
    马加
    苏联已经成功的发射了世界上第一颗人造地球卫星，它是献给十月革命节四十周年最高贵的礼物，创造了科学的新纪元，实现了人类多年的梦想，揭开了宇宙的秘密，把赞美的诗句像彩虹似的装饰到它的身上，也并不显得夸张，一只神奇的异鸟，给全人类带来了和平的福音。
    一天夜晚，我打开无线电的机纽，听到北京广播电台播送人造地球卫星传来的讯号，哒哒哒……我不懂得它的密码，但是，我却熟悉它的声音，那么幽美，那么激昂，那么起伏而富于感情的节奏，一只向宇宙进军的凯歌，胜利的凯歌呵！从马丁炉边的工人到橡胶树下的小孩都向它欢呼。只有自我陶醉在实力政策的五角大楼里的主人才现出震惊，一个美国议员不能不慨叹说“人造卫星可能会使战争概念完全改变。”
    四十年前，彼得堡的“阿芙乐尔”舰炮击了冬宫，世界上出现了第一个社会主义国家，才使战争的概念完全改变过来，它埋葬了沙皇的屠刀，撕毁了克伦斯基政府的卖国条约，宣布了和平法令。和平是一个神圣的名字，它对帝国主义好战分子是最响亮的檄文，使人类不再成为科学的祭品，而成为科学的主人。
    社会主义解放了人民，给人民一种科学和艺术的智慧，不断的创造出奇迹来。开辟世界远程航线的是苏联英雄瓦列里·契卡洛夫，他像神鹰一样探测了北极圈，达到了美洲，成为二十世纪的哥伦布。苏联的另一位英雄阿历克赛·马烈西叶夫，战争剥夺了他的两条腿，革命却给他更坚强的意志，在一天内能够完成七次战斗飞行又击落德寇两架飞机，这真是一个奇迹，这个奇迹已经记载在史诗“真正的人”里，了解马烈西叶夫的灵魂是波列伏依，不是帝国主义好战分子。戈林在纽伦堡受着国际军事法庭审判时阴郁的说“我们不知道也不了解苏维埃人”，这是纳粹的悲鸣，也有几分真实性，过去的希特勒和戈林是不了解苏维埃人的，今天的艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯也是不了解苏维埃人的。
    最近，美国好战分子支持土耳其向叙利亚边疆蠢动，美国的旗舰和航空母舰旅航开往地中海，这不难想像出煤油大王洛克斐勒贪得无厌的野心，那贪婪的野心如同毒蛇淌出的唾液，从密西西比河一直流到波斯湾，旗舰上穿着美国海军将校制服的人染了做石油生意的火药气味。翻过高加索山的另一面呢？苏联的里海像森林似的满布着油塔的钢架，可是，靠巴库的海滨是一片灿烂的公园，到了11月，那里还盛开着白色的菊花，红色的美人蕉，紫色的鸡冠花，海风徐徐的吹拂，掀起了少女的红围巾，露出乌黑的头发，每一个阿塞拜疆的少女都带着一种从容自信的步调。她们的生活里有青春，有海，也有和平。
    每一个苏维埃人，都爱着自己祖国的山川，这就是一种力量，把战争的概念改变成为和平的概念。和平的景象充满了一种诗意，贝加尔湖为什么给人一种深沉神秘的感觉呢？安加拉河又是那么清澈明媚？伏尔加河又是那么辽阔雄壮呢？而莫斯科河畔的夜晚又是那么灯火辉煌呢？是由于克里姆林宫上的红星照耀的缘故么？红宝石的星星呵！全世界工人阶级的灯塔，全人类解放的灯塔，没有你的照耀，不知道历史要黑暗多少年。
    我初次看见克里姆林宫上的红星，是在1951年十月革命节的前夕，住在莫斯科大旅馆里，临着部长会议大厦，对面就是红场，每当我上了旅馆第八层楼房，撩起了窗帘，那克里姆林宫塔尖上的红星像火球似的闪露出来，神奇的，奥秘的，带着一种不可思议的光辉，冲破朦胧的白雾，闪耀着那种辐射的红色力量，红得透明，光圈脉脉的跳动，向一切追求真理的人们昭示，我多么狂喜呵！革命圣地的红星，永恒的红星，人类解放的一颗红星呵！
    我永远不能忘记的，那十月红场上泛滥着海洋一样红色的旗子，摇晃着，汹涌着，波动着，礼炮和欢呼的风暴席卷了红场，在红星底下涌出了强大的工人阶级的队伍，没有什么力量可以阻挡住的。夜晚，红场上燃起了冲天的焰火，光彩夺目的、五色缤纷的、如同抛在天空上的长虹，千万条火箭直达到云霄。科学并不是梦幻，过了六年的今天，苏联的人造地球卫星骄傲的在太空里出现了，它比焰火有着更多的光彩，更多的诗。
    也是六年前的今天，我参观了列宁格勒日丹诺夫少年宫，它装饰得异常的美观、壮丽，辉煌得抵得上一个皇宫，但是；主宰这个世界的却是受过列宁洗礼扎着红领巾的少先队员，上千的少先队员都是活泼的、健康的、聪明的，充满了一种乐观的情感，知识超过了他们的年龄。这里有着可供试验的汽车、汽船、机床、火车，他们已经不是玩具的伴侣，而是熟练的驾驶员了。和机器摆在一起的还有一具原子能制造模型，显然，原子能对于苏联扎红领巾的少年早已不是秘密了。  
    追求光明的人是与玩火的人根本不相同的，烽火也有光，那是一种灾难的光、毁灭的光、死亡的光，玩火的人往往是自焚的。拿破仑在莫斯科纵过火，就结束了他的王朝命运。希特勒第一次放火烧了国会大厦，惹起了全世界工人阶级的愤怒；第二次放火烧了斯大林格勒，这个历史上有名的察里津就变成了德寇的坟墓。玩火的魔王永远也不会了解：你们喷射的火焰曾经熔化了斯大林格勒的柏油马路，今天却竖立起大理石的英雄纪念碑，瓦砾堆铺上了花岗石，建立林荫路的胜利公园。历史的规律，胜利永远是属于追求光明的英雄。
    苏联的星星，人类的光明。
