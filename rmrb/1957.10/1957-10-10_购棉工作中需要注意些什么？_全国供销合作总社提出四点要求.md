Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The person in charge of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives told Xinhua reporters today about the situation and problems in cotton procurement. By the end of September, according to incomplete statistics, 3.4 million dan of cotton had been purchased, an increase of approximately 44% compared to the same period last year. However, it is still more than 3% lower than the same period in 1955. Currently, cotton procurement is entering its most critical period, and we must make every effort to complete the procurement task ahead of schedule or exceed the target.

The person in charge said that there are four most important tasks that must be done well in the current cotton procurement. First, we must further strengthen the cotton picking work of agricultural cooperatives. Only by achieving careful harvesting and picking can we increase production; only with increased production can we increase procurement. Neglecting cotton picking makes it difficult to complete the procurement task. This year, most cotton-growing agricultural cooperatives have improved their cotton picking work, implementing production team contracting, value guarantee, and rewarding for exceeding quotas, and assigning cotton picking work by mu and ridge, contracting work to households, which has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm and responsibility of cooperatives, teams, and members in cotton picking. Many agricultural cooperatives in Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Shandong, and Jiangsu provinces have implemented methods of separate picking, separate drying, separate storage, separate ginning, and separate sales. Therefore, the cotton is picked well and clean. However, some areas still do not recognize the importance of cotton picking and, like last year, lose a lot of dead cotton bolls, fallen cotton, and "eyelashes." This is very noteworthy. These areas must quickly absorb advanced experience, overcome shortcomings, and improve their work. We require all cotton-growing agricultural cooperatives to pick cotton well and cleanly, ensuring that every cotton fiber returns home. In this way, we can increase raw materials for the national textile industry and increase income for agricultural cooperatives and their members.

Second, continue to strengthen and improve procurement work, and truly achieve fast and increased procurement. Although this year's procurement work has improved, it has not yet met our requirements. Some areas still have concerns about fast and increased procurement, such as being afraid that the warehouses will not be able to accommodate it, that fire-fighting equipment will not keep up, that processing will be too concentrated, and that employing more people will increase costs, and so on. These ideas are all wrong. We should break down these concerns and try to solve problems such as warehousing, fire protection, and processing. If there is a shortage of personnel, people should be quickly transferred from cooperative at all levels to increase strength. In short, we should boldly engage in fast and increased procurement. Some areas have developed blindly optimistic and complacent ideas, relaxing publicity work and the organization of procurement work, with the amount of procurement accounting for only a small portion of the amount picked. This is a very bad phenomenon and should be changed quickly. Liaison officers sent by procurement stations to various villages should preferably be changed to resident cooperative liaison officers and go deep into the production teams to work. Liaison officers should be responsible for guiding cotton picking work and assisting agricultural cooperatives in picking cotton well and cleanly, ensuring that every cotton fiber returns home. Production teams should be organized to actively sell cotton, achieving picking, drying, selling, and procurement as soon as possible.

Third, resolutely implement the regulations in the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council regarding cotton farmers generally retaining only two jin of cotton for their own use. It is even better if they voluntarily retain less. The goal is to retain less and sell more, retain inferior cotton and sell good cotton. To achieve this goal, the key lies in educating cotton farmers about patriotic cotton sales and thrift. If cotton farmers across the country only retain two jin of cotton, then the state can procure 200 million jin more cotton than last year, and agricultural cooperatives and farmers will increase their income by nearly 200 million yuan compared to last year.

Fourth, make efforts to organize the supply of autumn and winter production materials and daily necessities. Meet the needs of agricultural cooperatives and farmers as much as possible.

The person in charge also hopes that Party committees at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party and local people's committees will strengthen their leadership over cotton procurement work.

### 购棉工作中需要注意些什么？  全国供销合作总社提出四点要求

    购棉工作中需要注意些什么？
    全国供销合作总社提出四点要求
    新华社9日讯　中华全国供销合作总社负责人今天就棉花收购工作的情况和问题对新华社记者说，到9月底止，据不完全统计，已收购棉花三百四十万担，约比去年同期增加44％。但比1955年同期还低3％多。目前棉花收购工作正进入最紧张的时期，我们必须尽一切努力争取提早或超额完成收购任务。
    这位负责人说，当前棉花收购中有四个最重要的工作必须做好。第一，必须再加强农业社的摘花工作。只有做到精收细摘，才能多产；多产才能多购。忽视了摘花工作，就很难完成采购任务。今年大部分植棉农业社，改善了摘花工作，实行生产队包产、包值、超额奖励，并将摘花工作分亩分垅，包工到户，大大发挥了社、队和社员摘花的积极性和责任心。河北、河南、湖北、山东和江苏等省的很多农业社，实行了分摘、分晒、分存、分轧和分售的办法。所以棉花摘的好，摘的净。但仍有一些地区，还没有认识到摘花工作的重要，还和去年一样，丢失了很多僵瓣、落地棉和“眼睫毛”。这是很值得注意的。这些地区必须迅速吸收先进经验，克服缺点，改进工作。我们要求所有植棉农业社，把棉花摘好摘净，做到朵絮还家。这样，既能为国家增加纺织工业原料，也能为农业社和社员增加收入。
    第二，继续加强和改善收购工作，真正作到快收多收。今年的收购工作虽有改进，但还没有达到我们的要求。有些地区对于快收多收还有顾虑，如怕仓库容纳不下，怕消防设备赶不上，怕加工太集中，怕用人多增加成本，等等。这些想法都是不对的。应该打破顾虑，努力设法解决仓储、消防、加工等问题。人员不足的应该迅速从各级社调人，增加力量。总之，应该放手地快收多收。有些地区产生了盲目乐观和麻痹大意思想，放松了宣传工作和收购的组织工作，收购数量仅占采摘数量的一小部分。这是很不好的现象，应该迅速改变。收购站派往各乡的联络员，最好改为驻社联络员，深入到生产队去工作。联络员应该负责指导摘花工作，协助农业社将棉花摘好摘净，朵絮还家。应该组织生产队积极售棉，作到随摘、随晒、随售和随收。
    第三，坚决贯彻执行中共中央和国务院指示中关于棉农自用棉在一般情况下只留二斤的规定。自愿少留者更好。要达到少留多卖、留次棉卖好棉的目的。要达到这个目的，关键在于对棉农进行爱国售棉和勤俭持家的教育。如果全国棉农都只留二斤棉花，那么国家就可以比去年多收购棉花两亿斤，农业社和农民将比去年增加近两亿元的收入。
    第四，努力组织秋冬生产资料和生活用品的供应工作。尽可能地满足农业社和农民的需要。
    这位负责人还希望中共各级党委和各地人民委员会加强对棉花收购工作的领导。
