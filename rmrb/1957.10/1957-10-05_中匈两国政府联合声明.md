Joint Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Hungarian People's
Republic

At the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, a delegation of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic, headed by the Prime Minister of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, János Kádár, paid a friendly visit to China from September 27 to October 5, 1957.

The delegation of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic visited Beijing and Shenyang, toured some factories, farms, schools, and scenic spots, and attended the National Day celebrations marking the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The warm meetings between the delegation of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic and the Chinese people once again demonstrated the deep friendship between the two peoples.

During the visit, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, received the delegation of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic.

During the visit, leaders of the Government of the People's Republic of China held talks with the delegation of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic.

Participating in the talks on the Chinese side were Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Long, Vice Premier, Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade, Zhang Wentian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Hao Deqing, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Hungarian People's Republic.

Participating on the Hungarian side were János Kádár, Prime Minister of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, György Marosán, Minister of State, Sándor Nógrádi, Ambassador of the Hungarian People's Republic to the People's Republic of China, István Szirmai, Director of the Information Bureau and advisor to the delegation, Péter Vályi, Deputy Director of the Planning Bureau, and Péter Kós, Director of the Asian-African Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The talks were conducted in a sincere and friendly atmosphere. During the talks, the two sides reviewed the development of the international situation since the joint statement issued by the delegations of the two governments in Budapest in January this year, and exchanged views on important issues in the current international situation, on further consolidating the unity of socialist countries, and on strengthening friendly cooperation between China and Hungary, and reached a complete consensus.

The two sides pointed out that the tense situation last autumn caused by the imperialist aggressor forces' military attack on Egypt and subversive activities against Hungary has, after the heroic struggle of the Egyptian and Hungarian peoples and the resolute opposition of peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world, once again moved toward relaxation. However, the imperialist aggressor forces are not reconciled to their defeat and are continuing to carry out various conspiratorial activities and create new tensions. Therefore, peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world must maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times, continue to strengthen the struggle, and make unremitting efforts to further ease international tensions and establish lasting world peace.

The two sides believe that an agreement among the major powers on the issue of arms reduction is one of the most important steps in easing international tensions. The two sides resolutely oppose the policy adopted by the US-led imperialist aggressor bloc of stepping up the arms race and arming the countries of its military bloc with nuclear weapons and missiles, and severely condemn their destructive actions in the disarmament negotiations. The two sides reiterate that the governments of China and Hungary fully support the correct position of the Soviet government on the issue of disarmament, and believe that the Soviet government's proposals at the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly on the declaration of peaceful coexistence among nations, the cessation of nuclear weapons testing under international supervision, the obligation of all nations not to use atomic weapons, and partial disarmament, are of extremely important practical significance for easing international tensions and promoting the solution of the issue of arms reduction.

The issue of German reunification must be resolved peacefully and democratically through direct negotiations between East and West Germany. West Germany's participation in the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization directly threatens the security and peaceful development of the European countries, including the Hungarian people. The two sides fully support the proposal put forward by Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic on July 27, 1957, for East and West Germany to negotiate the formation of a sovereign and independent confederation as a preliminary measure for the reunification of Germany, and the proposals put forward during the talks between the delegations of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on August 13, 1957, regarding the reunification of Germany on peaceful and democratic principles and the maintenance of European peace. The two sides believe that these proposals and positions fully conform to the national interests of the entire German people and are conducive to the peace and security of Europe.

The two sides support the proposal of the Government of the Romanian People's Republic to convene a conference of governments of the Balkan countries, and believe that cooperation among these countries is not only fully in line with the interests of the peoples of Southeast European countries, but also of great significance for maintaining peace in Europe.

The Western imperialist bloc is using every means to try to restore or maintain the colonial rule they have lost or are losing as a result of the effective liberation struggles of the peoples of the Middle East. The two sides particularly emphasize that the US imperialist aggressor bloc, in order to step up the implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," has recently openly instigated a series of subversive activities against Syria, and directly carried out military intimidation, attempting to gain control over Syria, in order to realize their sinister aim of further suppressing the national liberation movement in Asia and Africa and enslaving the peoples of Asia and Africa. These conspiratorial activities of the US imperialist aggressor bloc seriously threaten peace in the Middle East region and the world. The two sides reiterate their support for the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa against colonialism and for national independence, and strongly condemn the US imperialist aggression against Syria and the armed attacks by the British and French imperialist blocs against the people of Oman and Algeria. The two sides declare that the two governments will continue to work with all peace-loving countries and peoples to carry out unremitting struggle to defend peace in the Middle East.

Peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is the basic principle of the two countries' foreign policy. The two governments reiterate that they will continue to work together with all peace-loving countries and peoples, based on this principle, to promote friendly cooperation among nations and to maintain lasting world peace.

The unity of socialist countries is a strong guarantee for world peace and the just cause of mankind. The two governments have always regarded consolidating and strengthening the unity of socialist countries as their highest international obligation, and will continue to work to further strengthen friendly cooperation among socialist countries and consolidate the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.

The imperialist aggressor forces are extremely afraid of the strengthening of the great unity of socialist countries, and they never give up their attempts to sow discord and sabotage socialist countries. Last October, they created a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, attempting to overthrow the socialist system in Hungary. However, the Hungarian people, with the help of the great Soviet Union, thoroughly crushed the counter-revolutionary restoration plot. The US aggressor bloc is not reconciled to their failure in the Hungarian counter-revolutionary incident. Not long ago, the United States coerced the United Nations to convene a special session to discuss the report of the so-called "Five-Nation Special Committee on the Hungarian Question," and illegally passed a shameful resolution. Recently, disregarding the solemn protest of the Government the Hungarian People's Republic, the United Nations, under the manipulation of the United States, again included the so-called "Hungarian Question" on the agenda of this session of the United Nations General Assembly. All these actions by the United States are attempts to use the United Nations to continue to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs and to divert world public opinion from the accusations against the US's aggressive actions. The Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports the statement of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government of September 10, 1957, regarding the report of the so-called "Five-Nation Special Committee on the Hungarian Question" and the just position of safeguarding Hungary's national sovereignty, and resolutely condemns the US aggressor bloc's attempt to continue to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs through the United Nations.

The Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports the firm measures taken by the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and safeguard the socialist system, and believes that the great achievements made by the Hungarian people in restoring normal domestic life, developing the national economy, and further strengthening friendly relations with socialist countries are not only conducive to the consolidation and prosperity of the Hungarian People's Republic, but also a major contribution to the maintenance of peace in Europe and the world.

The two sides noted with satisfaction that the friendly and cooperative relations between the People's Republic of China and the Hungarian People's Republic have been continuously developing in recent years. This fraternal mutual support and cooperation is greatly conducive to the development of the socialist construction of the two countries. The two sides also exchanged views on further developing friendly cooperation between the two countries in the fields of economy, culture, science, and technology, and decided to send economic delegations to each other in the near future for visits in order to further study the possibility of expanding economic cooperation between the two countries based on the actual conditions of the two countries.

The friendly visit of the delegation of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic to the People's Republic of China and the talks between the leaders of the two governments greatly helped to further deepen mutual understanding between the two peoples, develop friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, strengthen the great unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and contribute to the noble cause of world peace and human progress.

    中华人民共和国政府匈牙利人民共和国政府联合声明
    以匈牙利人民共和国工农革命政府总理卡达尔·亚诺什为首的匈牙利人民共和国政府代表团应中华人民共和国政府的邀请，在1957年9月27日至10月5日间在中国进行了友好访问。
    匈牙利人民共和国政府代表团访问了北京、沈阳，参观了一些工厂、农场、学校和名胜古迹，并且参加了中华人民共和国建国八周年国庆观礼。匈牙利人民共和国政府代表团同中国人民热情的会见，再一次体现出两国人民之间的深厚友谊。
    在访问期间，中华人民共和国主席毛泽东接见了匈牙利人民共和国政府代表团。
    在访问期间，中华人民共和国政府领导人和匈牙利人民共和国政府代表团进行了会谈。
    参加会谈的，中国方面有国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来，副总理贺龙，对外贸易部部长叶季壮，外交部副部长张闻天，中华人民共和国驻匈牙利人民共和国大使郝德青。
    匈牙利方面有工农革命政府总理卡达尔·亚诺什，国务部部长马罗山·捷尔吉，匈牙利人民共和国驻中华人民共和国大使诺格拉第·山道尔，代表团顾问情报局局长西尔莫伊·伊斯特万，计划局副局长瓦伊·彼得，外交部亚非处处长科什·彼得。
    会谈是在诚挚和友好的空气中进行的。在会谈中，双方回顾了自从今年1月两国政府代表团在布达佩斯发表联合声明以后的国际局势的发展，同时就当前国际形势中的重要问题，就进一步巩固社会主义国家的团结和加强中匈两国友好合作的问题交换了意见，并且取得了完全一致的看法。
    双方指出，去年秋天，由于帝国主义侵略势力对埃及的军事进攻和对匈牙利的颠覆活动所造成的一度紧张局势，经过埃及人民和匈牙利人民的英勇斗争和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的坚决反对，已经重新趋向和缓。但是帝国主义侵略势力还不甘心于他们的失败，仍在继续进行各种阴谋活动，制造新的紧张局势。因此，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民必须随时保持高度警惕，继续加强斗争，为进一步和缓国际紧张局势、建立世界持久和平而不断努力。
    双方认为，大国就裁减军备问题达成协议是和缓国际紧张局势的最重要的步骤之一。双方坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团采取的加紧军备竞赛和以核武器和导弹武装其军事集团国家的政策，并且严厉谴责他们在裁军谈判中的破坏行为。双方重申，中匈两国政府完全支持苏联政府在裁军问题上的正确主张，并且认为，苏联政府在第十二届联合国大会上就各国和平共处的宣言、在国际监督下停止试验核武器、各国承担不使用原子武器的义务和局部裁军等问题所提出的建议，对和缓国际紧张局势和促进裁减军备问题的解决具有极为重要的现实意义。
    德国的统一问题必须在和平、民主的基础上由东西德直接协商求得解决。西德参加侵略性的北大西洋集团直接威胁到包括匈牙利人民在内的欧洲各国人民的安全和和平发展。双方完全支持1957年7月27日德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥提出的、由东西德协商组成主权独立的联盟作为统一德国的初步措施的建议和1957年8月13日苏联和德意志民主共和国党和政府代表团会谈时提出的、关于在和平、民主原则上统一德国和维护欧洲和平的主张。双方认为，这些建议和主张完全符合于全德人民的民族利益，并且有利于欧洲的和平和安全。
    双方支持罗马尼亚人民共和国政府关于召开巴尔干半岛各国政府会议的建议，并且认为这些国家之间的合作不仅完全符合于东南欧各国人民的利益，而且对维护欧洲的和平具有重大的意义。
    西方帝国主义集团正在用一切办法，力图恢复或者保持他们由于中近东各国人民有成效的解放斗争而丧失的或正在丧失的殖民统治。双方特别强调指出，美帝国主义侵略集团为了加紧推行“艾森豪威尔主义”，最近以来明目张胆地对叙利亚策动了一系列的颠覆活动，并且直接进行军事恫吓，企图取得对叙利亚的控制，以便实现他们进一步镇压亚非国家的民族解放运动和奴役亚非人民的罪恶目的。美帝国主义侵略集团的这些阴谋活动，严重地威胁着中近东地区和全世界的和平。双方重申支持亚非各国人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，坚决谴责美帝国主义对叙利亚的侵略行为和英法帝国主义集团对阿曼和阿尔及利亚人民的武装进攻。双方声明，两国政府将继续同所有爱好和平的国家和人民一起，为捍卫中近东的和平进行不懈的斗争。
    不同社会制度国家和平共处是两国外交政策的基本原则。两国政府重申将根据这一原则同所有爱好和平的国家和人民继续为促进国际间的友好合作和维护全世界的持久和平而共同努力。
    社会主义国家之间的团结是世界和平和人类正义事业的坚强保证。两国政府一向把巩固和加强社会主义国家的团结当作自己最高的国际义务，并且将为进一步加强社会主义国家间的友好合作关系，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结而继续努力。
    帝国主义侵略势力十分惧怕社会主义国家的伟大团结的加强，他们从不放弃对社会主义国家进行挑拨离间和阴谋破坏的企图。去年10月间他们在匈牙利制造反革命叛乱，企图推翻匈牙利的社会主义制度。但是，匈牙利人民在伟大苏联的援助下彻底粉碎了反革命的复辟阴谋。美国侵略集团不甘心他们在匈牙利反革命事件中的失败。不久以前，美国挟持联合国召开特别会议，讨论所谓“匈牙利问题五国特别委员会”的报告，并且非法通过了可耻的决议。最近联合国不顾匈牙利人民共和国政府的严正抗议，在美国操纵下，又将所谓“匈牙利问题”列入本届联合国大会的议事日程。美国的这一切作法是企图利用联合国继续干涉匈牙利的内政，并且转移世界舆论对美国侵略行动的指责。中华人民共和国政府完全支持匈牙利工农革命政府1957年9月10日关于所谓“匈牙利问题五国特别委员会”的报告的声明和维护匈牙利国家主权的正义立场，并且坚决谴责美国侵略集团妄图利用联合国继续对匈牙利内政进行干涉的阴谋。
    中华人民共和国政府完全支持匈牙利工农革命政府为巩固无产阶级专政和维护社会主义制度所采取的坚定措施，并且认为，匈牙利人民在恢复国内正常生活、发展国民经济和进一步加强同社会主义各国友好关系等方面所取得的巨大成就，不仅有利于匈牙利人民共和国的巩固和繁荣，而且也是对维护欧洲和世界和平的重大贡献。
    双方满意地指出，中华人民共和国和匈牙利人民共和国之间的友好合作关系近年来获得了不断的发展。这种兄弟般的相互支持和合作，大大有利于两国的社会主义建设事业的发展。双方还就进一步发展两国在经济、文化、科学技术等方面的友好合作关系交换了意见，并且决定在最近互派经济代表团进行参观访问，以便根据两国的实际情况，进一步研究扩大两国经济合作的可能性。
    匈牙利人民共和国政府代表团在中华人民共和国进行的友好访问和两国政府领导人之间举行的会谈，大大有助于进一步加深两国人民的互相了解，发展两国间的友好合作关系，加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家的伟大团结，并且有助于世 界和平和人类进步的崇高事业。
