Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd: Former Indonesian Vice President Dr. Hatta said at a press conference held for Chinese and foreign journalists this afternoon in Beijing that after returning to Indonesia, he will strive to strengthen the friendship between Indonesia and China.

Hatta said that after visiting China, he is deeply convinced that the friendship between the two countries will be strengthened. He also said that since Indonesia and the People's Republic of China recognized each other in 1950, the friendship between the two countries has grown. The Bandung Conference held in 1955 established closer cooperation between Asian and African countries.

He said that the Bandung spirit will ultimately become stronger and stronger. The Bandung spirit should be promoted to the whole world, although this is not an easy task.

He said that the countries participating in the Bandung Conference had some differences of opinion, but they reached a consensus on major issues and agreed to work to safeguard world peace and oppose colonialism.

Speaking about his impressions of China, Dr. Hatta said that some of the factories he visited in China were beyond his expectations.

He said he was pleased to see some practical evidence showing a continuous improvement in workers' living standards, that rents in China were very low, and that workers' lives were stable.

Dr. Hatta said that he also saw that many jobs were still being done by human labor. He also said that using so many workers was uneconomical.

He said that from what he understood about the situation of Chinese agriculture, he was pleased to see that farmers had shifted from small land ownership to cooperatives. He found that agriculture was making rapid progress.

He said that China is concentrating on developing heavy industry, but for various reasons, Indonesia cannot develop heavy industry first.

Hatta also talked about the issues of disarmament and the prohibition of the use and testing of nuclear weapons. He said: "This issue has been discussed for a long time, and I don't think the disarmament conference has yielded any results. If the two largest countries in the world, the Soviet Union and the United States, agree not to engage in war for twenty-five years, international tensions will be eased, and a better atmosphere can be created for world peace."

The former Indonesian Vice President also said that the situation in the Middle East has eased somewhat, and that Saudi Arabian King Saud's visit to Damascus could produce many good results.

    哈达博士在北京举行的记者招待会上说
    将努力加强印度尼西亚同中国的友谊
    新华社2日讯  印度尼西亚前副总统哈达博士在今天下午举行的中外记者招待会上说，他回到印度尼西亚以后，将努力加强印度尼西亚同中国的友谊。
    哈达说，他在访问中国以后，深信两国之间的友谊将会加强。他又说，自从1950年印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国互相承认以后，两国之间的友谊已经有了增长。在1955年举行的万隆会议，使亚洲国家和非洲国家建立了更加密切的合作。
    他说，万隆精神终究是会愈来愈强有力的。应该把万隆精神推广到全世界，虽然这不是一件轻而易举的事情。
    他说，参加万隆会议的国家是有一些不同意见的，但是它们在主要问题上达成了一致决议，同意为维护世界和平和反对殖民主义而努力。
    哈达博士在谈到他对中国的印象时说，他在中国参观的一些工厂，都是他所没有预料到的。
    他说，他很高兴地看到表明工人生活水平不断提高的一些实际证据，中国的房租很低，工人的生活安定。
    哈达博士说，他也看到有许多工作仍然是在由人力来做。他并说，用这么多的工人是不经济的。
    他说，从他所了解到的中国农业的情况看来，他很高兴看到农民已经从小土地所有制转到合作社制。他发现农业正在取得迅速的进展。
    他说，中国正在集中力量发展重工业，但是由于种种原因，印度尼西亚不能首先发展重工业。
    哈达还谈到了关于裁军和禁止使用和试验核武器的问题。他说：“这个问题已经讨论了很长的时间，我认为裁军会议没有得到结果。如果苏联和美国这两个世界上最大的国家同意在二十五年内不进行战争，国际紧张局势就会得到缓和，同时也就可以为世界和平创造较好的气氛。”
    这位前印度尼西亚副总统还说，中东局势已经有所缓和，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特的大马士革之行能够产生许多良好结果。
