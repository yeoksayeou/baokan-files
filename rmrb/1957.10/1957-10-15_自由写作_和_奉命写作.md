Title: "Free Writing" and "Commissioned Writing"

    "Free writing" seems very "noble," but it is actually hypocritical and deceptive nonsense. Lenin said it well: "The freedom of bourgeois writers, artists, and actors is merely a masked (or a hypocritically masked) dependence on the moneybag, a dependence on bribery, a dependence on patronage." (Party Organization and Party Literature) Right-wing elements such as Lu Ban and Sha Meng, directors at the Changchun Film Studio, openly clamored that artistic activity is for earning RMB. They didn't even want the fig leaf of false nobility.

    Since there is no absolute "free writing," there is nothing to criticize about "commissioned writing." The class nature and Party spirit of literature are objective truths. Writers always write from a certain standpoint. Having a standpoint inevitably means being "commissioned." If not "commissioned" by the proletariat, then "commissioned" by the bourgeoisie. Revolutionary writers, not shying away from their own standpoint, need not fear slanders such as "commissioned writing." Lu Xun openly admitted that his "Nahan" (Call to Arms) was "literature written on commission." "However, what I followed was the command of the revolutionary pioneers of that time, which was also a command I was willing to follow, definitely not the emperor's edict, nor the command of gold coins and real knives." ("San Xian Ji")

    Feng Xuefeng criticized Lao She's "Chun Hua Qiu Shi" (Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits) as a "commissioned writing," revealing his intention of being dissatisfied with why Lao She stood on the side of the proletariat and the people, instead of standing on the side of the bourgeoisie. This one example is enough to prove that Feng Xuefeng's literary views are truly "108,000 miles" away from Lu Xun's revolutionary literary tradition.

### “自由写作”和“奉命写作”

    “自由写作”和“奉命写作”
    “自由写作”看来“清高”得很，其实是虚伪的，骗人的鬼话。列宁说得好：“资产阶级的作家、艺术家和演员的自由，不过是戴着假面具的（或者戴着伪善的假面具的）对于钱袋的依赖、对于收买的依赖、对豢养的依赖。”（党的组织和党的文学）长春电影制片厂导演吕班、沙蒙等右派分子公开叫嚷着艺术活动就是为了挣人民币。连假清高的遮羞布也不要了。
    既然没有绝对的“自由写作”，“奉命写作”就没有什么可以非议之处。文学之有阶级性、党性是客观真理，作家写作总有一定的立场，有立场就不免要“奉命”，不“奉”无产阶级之“命”，就“奉”资产阶级之“命”。革命的作家，既不讳言自己的立场，就毋须乎怕听“奉命写作”之类的诽谤。鲁迅就公然承认他的“呐喊”是“遵命文学”。“不过我所遵奉的，是那时革命的前驱者的命令，也是我自己所愿意遵奉的命令，决不是皇上的圣旨，也不是金圆和真的指挥刀。”（“南腔北调集”）
    冯雪峰责难老舍先生的“春华秋实”是“奉命写作”的东西，揭出他的心意是不满意老舍先生为什么要站在无产阶级、人民大众的立场写作，而不站在资产阶级的立场写作。即此一例，也足证冯雪峰的文艺观点与鲁迅的革命的文艺传统真是相距“十万八千里”。
