    Jiangxi Has a Large Copper Mine
    A copper deposit with abundant reserves and a huge scale has recently been discovered in northeastern Jiangxi Province.
    Based on the materials obtained during the general survey last year, geological personnel conducted large-scale exploration here this year. At present, dozens of control boreholes that have been drilled have all found ore. The ore layer is very thick, some are hundreds of meters thick; the overburden is very thin, which is convenient for open-pit mining. The controlled reserves have now increased by two times compared to the figures estimated at the beginning of the general survey.
    New mineralization points have recently been discovered three kilometers away from this mining area. Large-scale exploration work is continuing.

    江西有个大铜矿
    江西省东北部最近发现了储量丰富、规模巨大的铜矿床。
    根据去年普查时掌握的材料，地质人员今年在这里进行了大规模的勘探。目前，已经打下去的几十个控制钻孔，都已孔孔见矿。矿层很厚，有的有几百公尺；覆盖层很薄，便于露天开采。现在控制的储量已经比开始普查时所估计的数字增加了两倍。
    在离这个矿区三公里的地方，最近又发现了新的矿化点。大规模勘探工作正在继续进行。
