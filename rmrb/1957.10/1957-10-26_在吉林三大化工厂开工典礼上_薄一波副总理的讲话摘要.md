Right before we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, and right before we celebrate the early completion of our country’s first Five-Year Plan, the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, the Jilin Dyestuff Plant, and the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant, three major projects, have been completed ahead of schedule and put into production. This is another crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship, and another major victory for our country’s socialist construction. In the process of constructing these three chemical plants, we received enormous and fraternal assistance from the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and Soviet experts. Our country’s workers put in a great deal of precious labor for the construction of these three factories. On behalf of the State Council, I express my heartfelt gratitude to them! As everyone knows, giving priority to the development of heavy industry is our country’s unwavering policy. In order to better implement this policy, on the premise of focusing on the development of heavy industry, we must develop industry and develop agriculture simultaneously. The Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program put forward by the Party Central Committee are aimed at accelerating the development of our country’s agriculture while realizing our country’s socialist industrialization, so that agricultural development is adapted to industrial development. The Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program put forward various tasks for the industrial sector, such as increasing coal production, increasing petroleum production, increasing agricultural machinery production, and increasing power generation, etc. The industrial sector must meet these requirements, but the most important task is to increase the production of chemical fertilizers. Because our country is a country with little arable land and a large population, the primary task for developing agricultural production is to increase the yield per unit area. To increase the yield per unit area, we must take various effective measures, such as building water conservancy projects, improving soil, improving seeds, improving farming systems, and increasing agricultural fertilizers, etc. The most important of these is to accelerate the development of the chemical fertilizer industry. The early completion and commissioning of these three factories will not only have a far-reaching impact on promoting the development of our country’s chemical industry, but also play an important role in promoting agricultural development and promoting the development of synthetic fibers. Further development of agriculture and synthetic fibers can enable the people of our country to have more improvements in terms of food and clothing. This is why the Party and the government and the people of the whole country are very concerned about the early commissioning of these three factories.
    Today, these three important chemical plants in our country are about to officially start production. I hope that all the workers and comrades in the production departments will be able to quickly master production technology, quickly become familiar with the performance of various equipment and instruments, and fully exert their production capacity to produce more and better chemical fertilizers, dyes, and calcium carbide for the country faster! I hope that the staff and all the comrades in the basic construction departments will be able to turn the various advanced experiences that the Soviet Union taught us in the process of building these three factories into their own experience, and apply them well to new construction work, so as to build various chemical plants for the country in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical, first of all, to build a large number of chemical fertilizer plants. The Jilin Fertilizer Plant, the Jilin Dyestuff Plant, and the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant were all designed with the help of the Soviet Union and supplied with equipment, and they are all key projects in our country’s first Five-Year Plan. These projects are not only technically advanced, but also, as identified by the National Acceptance Committee, the quality of construction is also good. The successive completion and gradual commissioning of these three important projects and many other important projects vividly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system, vividly demonstrate the infinitely bright prospects for the development of our country’s socialist construction, and vividly demonstrate the great strength of Sino-Soviet friendship.

    在吉林三大化工厂开工典礼上
    薄一波副总理的讲话摘要
    正当我们欢庆伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的前夕，正当我们欢庆我国第一个五年计划提前完成的时候，吉林肥料厂、吉林染料厂、吉林电石厂三大工程，提前完工并且投入生产了。这是中苏友谊的又一结晶，这是我国社会主义建设的又一重大胜利。这三个化学工厂在建设的过程中，曾经得到苏联政府、苏联人民和苏联专家巨大的兄弟般的援助。我国的职工们，为了这三个工厂的建设，曾经付出了许许多多宝贵的劳动。我代表国务院分别向他们表示衷心的感谢！大家知道，优先发展重工业是我国坚定不移的方针。为了更好的贯彻这一方针，在以发展重工业为中心的前提下必须发展工业和发展农业同时并举。党中央所提出的发展农业纲要四十条，就是为了在实现我国社会主义工业化的同时，加速我国农业的发展，使农业发展和工业发展相适应。发展农业纲要四十条给工业部门提出了各方面的任务，如增产煤炭、增产石油、增产农业机器、增加发电等等，工业部门必须满足这些要求，但是最重要的任务，是增产化学肥料。因为我国是一个耕地少人口多的国家，要发展农业生产首要的任务是提高单位面积产量，要提高单位面积产量，就要采取各种有效措施，如兴修水利、改良土壤、改良种子、改进耕作制度、增加农业肥料等等。就中最主要的是加速化学肥料工业的发展。这三个工厂的提前完成投入生产，不仅对于推动我国化学工业的发展有深远影响，而且对于促进农业发展、促进合成纤维的发展，有重要的作用。农业和合成纤维进一步发展，就可以使我国人民在吃饭、穿衣方面能有更多的改善，这就是党和政府以及全国人民之所以非常关心这三个工厂提前投入生产的原因。
    今天，我国这三个重要的化学工厂就要正式开工生产了。我希望生产部门的全体职工同志们，能够很快地掌握生产技术，很快熟悉各种设备和仪表的性能，充分发挥生产能力，为国家更快地生产更多、更好的化学肥料、染料和电石！我希望基本建设部门的职工和全体同志们，能够把建设这三个工厂过程中，苏联教给我们的各种先进经验，统统变成自己的经验，并且很好地运用到新的建设工作中去，以便为国家又多、又快、又好、又省地建设各种化学工厂，首先是建设大批的化学肥料工厂。吉林肥料厂、吉林染料厂、吉林电石厂都是苏联帮助我国设计并且供应设备的，都是我国第一个五年计划中的重点工程。这些工程，不仅技术先进，而且经国家验收委员会鉴定，建设的质量同样是好的。这三项重要工程和其他许多重要工程的相继完成并陆续投入生产，生动地证明了社会主义制度的优越性，生动地证明了我国社会主义建设事业发展的无限美好前景，生动地证明了中苏友谊的伟大力量。
