    Grasp Newly Emerging Problems, Debate Again
    Zhuangzi Commune Peasants Receive Another Education
    (Our Dispatch) The Zhuangzi Commune in Chang’an Township, Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, seized upon new problems that arose during the autumn harvest and planting to continue conducting major debates centered on grain, further enhancing the socialist consciousness of the masses.
    In the previous period, the Zhuangzi Commune had launched a debate on the issue of unified grain purchase and sale throughout the commune. This debate exposed the concealment and private distribution of more than 30,000 jin of grain last year, resolving the grain shortage problem. However, because many specific ideological problems among the commune members were not thoroughly criticized, phenomena such as private distribution of grain occurred again during the autumn harvest and planting. This year, the commune produced a total of 30,000 jin of soybeans, of which all but 10,000 jin designated for state purchase and seed retention were privately distributed by the teams. After the soybeans were privately distributed, the black market became active again. The black market price of soybeans rose steadily to 2 jiao and 6 fen per jin. Even more serious was the saying, "Although the black market benefits the rich, it also helps the poor solve their difficulties." In addition, extravagant waste also began to grow.
    After discovering this situation, the commune leadership seized upon these specific instances and launched another major debate among all commune members. This made everyone realize that the private distribution of soybeans had four harms: first, it required the state to supply more edible oil; second, it created black market speculation; third, it increased waste; and fourth, it was unreasonable and violated the state's policy of unified grain purchase and sale. Regarding the issue of black market trading, everyone launched a debate targeting the statement by commune member Cai Genbao that "if poor people have nothing to eat, they have no way to go without black market trading." They first calculated an account for Cai Genbao: his living standards had risen year by year since joining the commune, and he had received 1,700 jin of wheat this spring alone. He refused to repay his 80 yuan loan but secretly sold 200 jin of grain on the black market. Everyone rebuked Cai Genbao, saying, "Your situation is not that of being poor and having no way to go, but of wanting to abandon the Communist Party and make a private fortune!" Many commune members also used their own experiences to illustrate the harm of black market speculation to the state and to individuals. In this way, the erroneous idea that buying and selling on the black market helped the poor was criticized, making everyone realize that black market trading was "a road to ruin and destruction." After the debate, everyone also had a correct understanding of the phenomenon of extravagance and waste, and began to establish the view of diligence and thrift in managing their households.
    Now, commune members are willing to take out soybeans for collective oil pressing. It is estimated that 20,000 jin of soybeans can be pressed into 2,000 jin of soybean oil, which can supply the entire commune of 1,100 people with six months of edible oil, reducing the state's supply of edible oil. The grain purchase task can also be overfulfilled by 70%.

    抓住新发生的问题再次进行辩论
    庄子社农民又受到一次教育
    本报讯　江苏省靖江县长安乡庄子社，抓住秋收秋种中发生的新问题，继续进行以粮食为中心的大辩论，进一步提高了群众的社会主义觉悟。
    前一个时期，庄子社曾在全社展开过一次粮食统购统销问题的辩论，这次辩论并揭发了去年隐瞒和私分的三万多斤粮食，解决了闹粮荒的问题，但由于社员中许多具体思想问题没有得到彻底批判，因此在秋收秋种中，又发生了私分粮食等现象。今年全社共产黄豆三万斤，除国家征购和留种籽一万斤外，其余全被队里私分了。黄豆被私分以后，黑市又活跃起来。黄豆的黑市价每斤一直上涨到二角六分。更严重的竟有不少说：“黑市虽对富人有利，但也帮助穷人解决了困难”。另外，铺张浪费现象也有所滋长。
    该社领导上发现这一情况后，就抓住这些具体事例，在全体社员中又发动了一次大辩论。使大家认识私分黄豆有四害：一是要国家多供应食油；二是产生黑市投机；三是增加浪费；四是不合理，违背了国家的粮食统购统销政策。对黑市买卖的问题，大家针对社员蔡根宝提出的“穷人没的吃，不买卖黑市没路走”的说法，展开了辩论。他们先替蔡根宝算了一笔账：他入社后生活年年上升，今春光麦子一项就分到一千七百斤。他借了八十元贷款不肯还，背地却在黑市上卖掉二百斤粮食。大家驳斥蔡根宝说：“你的情况那里是穷了没路走，而是想丢了共产党去发私财！”许多社员还用亲身体会说明了黑市投机对国家对个人的危害。这样，起初以为买卖黑市对穷人有帮助的错误思想也就受到了批判，使大家认识到黑市买卖是“家破人亡的道路”。经过辩论，大家对铺张浪费现象也有了正确认识，开始树立了勤俭持家的观点。
    现在，社员已愿意拿出黄豆集体榨油。预计二万斤黄豆可榨出豆油二千斤，可供全社一千一百人六个月的食油供应，就可减少国家的食油供应量。征购粮食任务也可超额70％完成。
