In the great blooming and great contending, some district and township cadres in Nanping Prefecture, Fujian, neglected the policy of uniting with middle peasants, and erroneously adopted a universally exclusionary attitude towards well-to-do middle peasants. In Pucheng, some township cadres openly stated at mass meetings that they would struggle against well-to-do middle peasants with a rude attitude. In Shunchang, some townships criticized the opinions of well-to-do middle peasants, regardless of whether they were reasonable or not. For example, when a well-to-do middle peasant mentioned that the grain price remained unchanged, while the price of handicrafts increased, with a coir raincoat rising from five yuan to eight yuan, the cadre refuted it unrealistically, saying that the price increase was also "reasonable." This kind of unfounded statement could not convince people with reason. In some places, during the great debate, well-to-do middle peasants were named at will, focusing only on their wrong words and deeds, and not accepting their correct opinions. All this is not conducive to uniting with middle peasants. Therefore, the Nanping Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions requiring all localities to pay close attention to this issue. It pointed out that the ideological problems among well-to-do middle peasants are internal contradictions among the people and should be treated with the method of "unity—criticism—unity." Capitalist words and deeds of some well-to-do middle peasants must be resolutely struggled against, but the method adopted should be small-scale reasoning and debate meetings; patient education should be given, and the method of debate should be adopted to resolve their wrong ideas, while their well-intentioned criticisms and suggestions must be accepted and adopted. In short, through debate, we should achieve further unity on a new basis. For well-to-do middle peasants who need to be criticized by name at township-wide or commune-wide reasoning meetings, they should not only have serious capitalist ideological words and deeds, but also have illegal acts and be approved by higher authorities.

    大辩论中要注意团结中农
    南平地委纠正部分区乡的错误做法
    本报讯　在大鸣大放和大辩论中，福建南平专区有一部分区、乡干部忽视了团结中农的政策，对富裕中农错误地采取一律排斥的态度。浦城有的乡干部公开在群众会上表示要以粗暴的态度斗争富裕中农。顺昌有的乡对富裕中农的意见，不管合理的还是错误的一律予以批评。如一个富裕中农提到粮食价格不变，而手工业品价格增加，棕衣一件由过去的五元涨到八元，干部就不够实事求是地反驳说涨价也是“合理的”。这种缺乏事实根据的说法不能以理服人。有些地方在大辩论时，也随意点富裕中农的名，只抓其错误言行，不接受他们对的意见。这都对团结中农不利。因此，中共南平地委特发出指示，要求各地十分重视这个问题。指出富裕中农中的思想问题是人民内部问题，应当采用“团结—批评—团结”的方法来对待他们。对于某些富裕中农的资本主义言行必须坚决斗争，但是采用的方法应是小型的说理辩论会；应耐心教育，采取辩论的办法来解决其错误思想，而对于他们提出的善意的批评建议，又必须接受采纳。总之要通过辩论，达到在新的基础上进一步的团结。对于需要召开全乡、全社性的说理大会，指名批判的富裕中农，则不仅应有严重的资本主义思想言论，而且应有违法行为并经上级批准才行。
