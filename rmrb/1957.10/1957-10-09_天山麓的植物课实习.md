    Plant Class Internship at the Foot of the Tianshan Mountains
    Eighth of August Agricultural College　Wang Bo
    One summer morning, we left the Eighth of August Agricultural College by school bus to conduct a plant class internship in the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains.
    The sound of the car engine awakened the sleeping mountains and rivers. The snow-capped Bogda Peak looked like a white-haired old man. This is the Tianshan Mountains, which people often say "cross Xinjiang horizontally."
    The closer we got to the mountains, the more different the scenery became. The green grass gradually increased, the low hills were covered in green clothes, and many wild roses appeared on both sides of the road, blooming with yellow and red flowers, exuding fragrance. The car sometimes bumped between cliffs, and sometimes sped downhill as if flying, truly giving one the feeling of "a light boat has passed ten thousand mountains."
    The car climbed over a small hill. "Ah! A forest! We're here!" Everyone cheered, "Great! Great!" A soprano sang "Xinjiang is a good place! There is beautiful scenery north and south of the Tianshan Mountains..." Immediately all the students echoed and sang, and even the teacher sang along with us.
    The mountains are full of spruce, which look like cones from a distance, and are especially dense on the shady slopes. That day we stayed in a mountain valley called Nanshan Xiaoquzi. To the south were towering peaks that pierced the clouds. To the north was a small stream flowing with snowmelt from the mountains, the water clear to the bottom. The sound of the rushing water, the calls of birds in the forest, the sounds of horses grazing on the mountain, and sometimes the rustling of towering trees in a gentle breeze, coupled with people's singing, formed a natural "symphony," truly a "green mountains and clear waters" scenery that was no less than that of Jiangnan. It was truly unexpected that there would be such a good place only a hundred kilometers from Urumqi.
    Once we arrived at the Tianshan Mountains, we began collecting plant specimens. Sometimes we had to cross several hills, which was very tiring. We had to collect dozens of plant specimens a day. I discovered a type of plant called *dangshen* (a type of Chinese medicine), with blue flowers like goblets and a very thin root about five centimeters long under the ground; but some students dug out very thick roots, because I was not careful. It is clear that one cannot be careless with science and should develop good habits of being careful and delving deeply.
    After we identified and classified the collected specimens, we observed the vertical distribution of plant height.
    There are many willows and poplars in the mountain valleys, and the most common herbs are *Sibbaldia procumbens*, thyme, and carrots. The low mountains are dense with spruce. At the top of the mountains and on the shady slopes there are spruce and poplars. The slopes are mostly grassy and also have *dangshen*, Ranunculaceae, and Rosaceae. When we climbed to two thousand nine hundred meters, a plateau suddenly appeared on the top of the mountain, full of dense grass and bright flowers, truly a particularly beautiful scenery. At this time the weather became gloomy, and the cool breeze blowing down from the high mountains made us feel cold even though we were wearing woolen sweaters. Here we saw Kazakh yurts and herds of horses, cattle, and sheep.
    As we climbed higher, there were fewer higher plants, and lower plants such as lichens, liverworts, and mosses appeared, and snow accumulated on the shady slopes of the mountains.
    This plant class internship gave us a rich lesson.

### 天山麓的植物课实习

    天山麓的植物课实习
    八一农学院　王博
    一个夏天的早晨，我们乘着校车离开了八一农学院，到天山北麓进行植物课实习。
    汽车的马达声震醒了沉睡的山川。白雪皑皑的博格达山峰，好像白发的老翁。这便是人们常说的：“天山横贯新疆”的天山。
    愈接近山，景象就愈不同了，青草逐渐增多了，低矮的小山披上了绿色的衣衫，公路两旁出现了很多野蔷薇开着黄色和红色的花朵，散发着香气。汽车有时颠簸在悬崖峭壁之间，有时下坡驶行如飞，真有“轻舟已过万重山”的感觉。
    车爬过了一个小山头，“呀！森林！到了！”大家都欢呼起来：“好啊！好啊！”女高音唱起了“我们新疆好地方呀！天山南北好风光……”立刻所有的同学都应声唱起来了，连老师也跟着我们唱了起来。
    山上到处是雪岭杉，远望去像个圆锥形。阴坡尤其密茂。当天我们住在地名南山小渠子的山沟里。南面有冲入云霄的高峰。北面有小溪一条，流着山上的雪水，水清见底。急流的水声，林间鸟雀的叫声，山上的牧马啸声，有时微风一吹，参天的树木飕飕作响，再加上人们的歌声凑成了天然的“交响乐”，真是“绿水青山”其景不亚江南。真想不到离乌鲁木齐一百公里竟有这样的好地方。
    到了天山，我们开始采集植物标本。有时要翻过几个山头，很是辛苦。我们一天要采集几十种植物标本。我发现有一种植物是党参（一种中药），花蓝色像酒杯一样，地皮下是一条很细的约五厘米左右的根；但有的同学却挖出很粗的根，原来我不细心。可见对科学不能粗枝大叶，应该养成细心、深究的良好习惯。
    我们把采集的标本进行识别和分类以后，便实习观察植物高度的垂直分布。
    山沟里多杨柳，草本以水杨梅、百里香、胡萝卜等属最多。低山雪岭杉很密。山顶和阴坡有雪岭杉、杨。坡地多草，还有党参、毛茛科、蔷薇科。我们爬到二千九百公尺时，山顶上忽然出现了一片高台地，全是茂密的草、鲜艳的花，风景真是如此多娇。这时天气阴晦了，高山吹下来的清凉的微风，虽然穿着绒衣还感觉有寒意。在这里看到了哈萨克族的帐篷和马牛羊群。
    我们往上爬，高等植物少了，出现了低等植物如地衣、地钱、苔藓等，并且在山的阴坡出现了积雪。
    这次植物课实习，给我们上了丰富的一课。
