    National Chess Tournament Preliminaries to End This Month; Last Year's Chinese Chess Champion Yang Guanlin Won Four and Drew One in Five Matches in Wuhan
    (Xinhua News Agency) The first stage (preliminary round) of the 1957 National Chess Tournament began on the 20th. The chess categories include Chinese chess, Go, and international chess, with a total of 106 chess players participating in the competition, held in Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Xi'an competition zones. The first stage of the competition will end at the end of October, and the winning players (the top four in Chinese chess, the top two in Go and international chess) will be eligible to participate in the second stage (final) competition starting on November 7 in Shanghai.
    The most exciting Chinese chess game in the Wuhan competition zone so far was between Yang Guanlin from Guangzhou, the 1956 National Chinese Chess Champion, and his strong opponent, Li Yiting, a 20-year-old famous Chinese chess player from Wuhan (fourth place in last year's National Chinese Chess Competition). On the evening of the 23rd, more than 2,000 spectators watched as the two sides fought for 70 minutes. Li Yiting was at a disadvantage due to the loss of a horse and automatically conceded defeat after only 25 moves. So far, Yang Guanlin's record in the Wuhan competition zone is four wins and one draw in five games, while Li Yiting has four wins and one loss. Both of them have hopes of participating in the second stage of the competition.

    全国棋类锦标赛预赛月内结束
    去年中国象棋冠军杨官璘在武汉五战四胜一和
    据新华社讯　1957年全国棋类锦标赛第一阶段比赛（预赛）已经在20日开始。比赛的棋类有中国象棋、围棋和国际象棋，参加比赛的各类棋手共一百零六人，他们分别在武汉、上海、沈阳和西安四个竞赛区举行。第一阶段比赛将在10月底结束，比赛中获得优胜的选手
  （中国象棋前四名、围棋和国际象棋前二名）将有资格参加11月7日开始在上海举行的第二阶段比赛（决赛）。
    武汉竞赛区比赛以来的最精采的一场中国象棋赛，是1956年的中国象棋全国冠军、广州选手杨官璘，力胜他的劲敌、武汉二十岁的象棋名手李义庭（去年中国象棋竞赛的全国第四名）。23日晚，观众达二千多人，双方战斗了七十分钟后，李义庭因损失一马处于劣势，自动宣告败北，这时才交手二十五个回合。到此，杨官璘在武汉竞赛区已战的五场中，成绩是四胜一和，李义庭四胜一负。他们两人都有参加第二阶段比赛希望。
