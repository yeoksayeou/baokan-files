    Scientist from a Working-Class Background
    By our reporter, Dai Feng
    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution enabled workers to seize power and manage state affairs. During the era of Soviet power, the talent and wisdom of the people have had full opportunity to be brought into play. In just forty years, the Soviet Union has cultivated a large number of outstanding cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds, including a large number of scientists from worker and peasant backgrounds.
    Alexander Mikhailovich Samarin is one of them.
    We met Samarin, a renowned Soviet steel smelting expert from a working-class background, in a simple office at the Institute of Metallurgy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
    Samarin was elected as a corresponding academician of the Academy of Sciences in 1946 and currently serves as the Deputy Director of the Institute of Metallurgy of the Academy of Sciences.
    After a cup of black tea and a brief silence, Samarin slowly began to recount his experiences.
    "I was born in 1902 in a small village called Shakanakh in the Gorky Province. My father was a poor peasant. The village had many people but little land. To avoid starvation, shortly after I was born, my father entrusted me to my grandmother to raise, and he left his hometown to work as a stoker on the Far Eastern Railway. My childhood was spent in loneliness.
    "When I was eleven years old, my father went to work in Irkutsk. Sometimes, when he had some money, he would ask someone to send some to us. My grandmother saw that I loved to read, so she asked a local acquaintance to introduce me to a primary school in a small county town fifteen kilometers away from the village.
    "Entering school was a mixture of joy and sorrow. I was happy to be able to study, but I was often sad because I didn't have enough money for food and lodging.
    "In my second year of school, my father was drafted into the army to participate in World War I. My father could no longer send me money. I had to help the teacher with some work. He sometimes gave me some food or a kopeck.
    "I勉强studied like this for two years. In the end, I still had to leave the school gate dejectedly….
      "After leaving school, I worked as a temporary laborer in a jam factory for a few months. Later, the factory closed down, and I began a life of wandering.
    "I had just turned fifteen before the October storm. I returned to my hometown and worked as a road repair worker on the nearby railway. I remember very clearly that there was a transfer worker in our work section named Abakumov, who was a Bolshevik.
      "Once, when we workers were discussing the war, Abakumov interjected: 'If we stop the war and overthrow the Tsarist government, peasants will have land, and workers will no longer be beasts of burden…'.
      "After that, Abakumov often met with us and told us why workers were suffering and why workers should unite to overthrow the Tsar. He always spoke in a way that moved and admired us so much, and from his words, I seemed to see my own past.
      "In the tense days before the October Revolution, our work section held mass meetings almost every day. Whenever I had free time, I would squeeze into the crowd and listen to everyone debate issues such as war and peace, work and bread. Abakumov's speeches influenced me more and more deeply. In this way, I involuntarily got involved in the great storm.
    "In those unforgettable days, I gradually became a new soldier of the proletarian revolution. On the eve of November 7th, our work section organized a Red Guard. I was one of the members. Together with the workers, we drove out the local bureaucrats and capitalists, and together with the peasants, we took back the land from the landlords and rich peasants. When the October Revolution succeeded and Lenin announced the establishment of the Soviet regime in Petrograd, we also established a local revolutionary committee. At that time, I was relatively young in the revolutionary worker ranks, and I knew a few words, so everyone elected me as the secretary.
    "From the first day of our revolutionary regime, the old intellectuals and old engineering personnel in the work section challenged us. At first, they went on strike, and later they disrupted the transportation system. The struggle was serious. I often suffered from a lack of technology, knowledge, and experience. From that time on, I sincerely understood that to support the Soviet regime, one should learn technology and acquire abundant knowledge.
    "My ideal was soon realized. In 1921, when I was nineteen years old, the Party selected a group of workers to study in the local university workers' supplementary classes, and I was one of them.
      "The ideal of many years was unexpectedly realized. I stepped into the university gate with excitement and determination. The university at that time was like another world. One day, a professor called us over and glanced at us contemptuously, saying: 'You workers who don't understand anything want to study at university and become engineers?!...' His words angered us so much that we turned around and left.
      "At that time, the thoughts of the professors and students in the university were chaotic. I still clearly remember that once, a history professor shouted openly in class: 'Your Soviet regime is about to end! Your New Economic Policy is a capitalist restoration!' At that time, apart from us worker students who stood up to oppose it, the other students were indifferent.
    "The situation was very unfavorable to us. If we could not establish Bolshevik influence in the university, it was clear that our desire to study would be in vain. So we worker students first organized ourselves and formed a student union. We promoted Bolshevik ideas, and within a year, we won over the majority of university students and exposed the reactionary words and deeds of some professors. We were victorious. The first year of studying in the workers' supplementary class was actually a sharp exercise in class struggle. From the second year onwards, we only made up for some basic courses.
    "I truly stepped into the door of science after I was twenty-three years old. In 1924, the Party sent me to study in the Chemistry Department of Nizhny University, and later I transferred to the Moscow Mining Academy.
    "For me, a worker who only knew some elementary arithmetic, neither understood advanced mathematics nor natural science, and suddenly stepped into the door of natural science, the difficulties were imaginable. At first, I couldn't understand the lectures, and I couldn't do the homework after class, which made me restless. In my spare time and in the evenings, some students went out to play, and some were resting. What about me? I always found a few worker students and sneaked into the classroom, locked the door, and buried myself in studying. At that time, I was already a probationary party member, and the Party was the force that supported me to overcome difficulties.
    "During my studies, there was a major famine along the Volga River. Our worker students' monthly ration was six kilograms of lentils. It wasn't enough to eat. Could we ask the Party to increase our rations? No, because the Party was in a very difficult situation. Five or six of us worker students organized ourselves and took turns going out to work. We brought back some black bread at night, divided it equally, and reviewed our lessons while eating.
    "Suffering, freezing, and studying were very intense, sometimes making us feel like we had no strength at all. At moments when it was unbearable, recalling the faces of the old engineering personnel, and thinking about how many construction projects were waiting for us, we gained a burst of strength.
    "During the First Five-Year Plan, the first alloy steel plant began to be built in the desolate Chelyabinsk. A nationwide construction of earth-shattering proportions was launched. These are also things that imperialists can never understand. No wonder they ridiculed us at that time, saying that our First Five-Year Plan was just a dream.
    "This alloy steel plant, like other plants built at that time, was built under very difficult circumstances. You can imagine: at that time, we had no experienced engineers, no complete set of machinery and equipment, and everything had to be bought with gold. At that time, after graduating from the Mining Academy, I came to the Chelyabinsk Alloy Steel Plant.
      "The first alloy steel plant was built by us engineers with little experience. There, I received the greatest training in my life, which gave me a more firm belief in the invincible creativity of the Soviet regime.
    "For example, at that time, we didn't have any workers to smelt alloy steel. At night, we would gather construction workers and porters. I would give them lectures: what is an alloy, what are the raw materials,… The first batch of Soviet alloy workers came about in this way.
    "We learned by doing and gradually gained some experience. Every new achievement encouraged us to study even harder.
      "Smelting special alloy steel was a common concern of scientists around the world at that time. In 1932, the Party sent me to study abroad for two years. After returning, I specialized in the study of smelting special alloy steel. After many repeated experiments, my research was finally successful.
    "In 1944, I was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. Shortly after the end of the war, I was elected as a corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. From 1946 to 1951, I served as the Deputy Minister of Higher Education of the Soviet Union.
    "Our scientists all know very clearly that they are serving the cause of socialism and communism. Politics leads science, and science serves political purposes. In a sense, we Soviet scientists are also political activists. We take the Party's leadership and instructions as the criteria for our research work. This is also the characteristic of working-class scientists.
      "Forty years have passed, and our country is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong. I have grown up along with the Soviet regime. All my achievements are also the achievements of the Party. People think I am a scientist, but I think I am also a student. I study while researching, while teaching, while learning…."

    工人出身的科学家
    本报记者　戴枫
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，使劳动者掌握了政权，管理国家大事。在苏维埃政权年代里，人民的天才和智慧得到充分发挥的机会。在短短四十年中，苏联培养出了大批工农出身的优秀干部，包括大批工农出身的科学家。
    亚历山大·米哈依洛维奇·沙马林就是其中的一个。
    在苏联科学院冶金研究所的一间简朴的办公室里，我们会见了工人出身的苏联著名钢铁冶炼专家沙马林。
    沙马林1946年被选为科学院通讯院士，现任科学院冶金研究所副所长。
    喝过一杯红茶，经过短暂的沉默后，沙马林慢慢地讲起自己的经历。
    “1902年，我出生在高尔基省一个叫做沙卡那赫的小村庄里。父亲是贫农。全村人多地少。为了不致饿死，在我出世不久，父亲就把我交给祖母抚养，自己远离家乡到远东铁路上去当司炉了。我的童年是在孤苦伶仃中度过的。
    “我十一岁那年，父亲又到伊尔库次克去做工了。有时，他手头宽裕点，就托人捎些钱给我们。祖母见我爱读书，就托了乡里的熟人，把我介绍到离乡十五公里的小县城里去上小学。
    “一进学校，真是悲喜交集。喜的是有书念了，悲的是经常没有钱吃饭和交宿费。
    “我上学第二年，父亲被召入伍，参加第一次世界大战。父亲不能再寄钱给我了。我不得不帮老师做点活儿。他有时给我些吃的，有时给我一个戈比。
    “这样勉强念了两年书。最后仍然不得不闷闷地走出了学校的大门……。
      “离开学校后，我在一个果酱厂当了几个月的临时小工。后来工厂停工，我也就开始了流浪生活。
    “十月大风暴前，我刚满十五岁。我回到了家乡，在附近铁路上当修路工人。我记得很清楚，那时，我们工段里有一个转运工人名叫阿伯库莫夫，他是个布尔什维克。
      “有一次，我们工人们谈论战争谈得正热烈的时候，阿伯库莫夫插口说：‘制止战争，推翻沙皇政府，农民就有土地，工人也会不再当牛马了……’。
      “此后，阿伯库莫夫常常和我们见面，给我们讲工人为什么苦，工人应该团结起来推翻沙皇。他讲得总是使我们那样激动和佩服，从他的话里我好像看见了自己的过去。
      “在十月革命前的紧张日子里，我们工段里差不多天天举行群众大会。一有空儿，我就钻在人群里，听大家争辩战争与和平、工作与面包等问题。阿伯库莫夫的讲话，一次比一次深刻地影响着我。就这样，我不由自主地卷进到大风暴里去了。
    “在那些难忘的日子里，我渐渐成了无产阶级革命的新战士。11月7日前夕，我们工段里组织了赤卫队。我是队员之一。我们和工人一起驱逐了当地的官僚和资本家，我们又和农民一起从地主和富农手里夺回了土地。十月革命胜利，列宁在彼得堡宣布建立苏维埃政权的时候，我们也成立了地方革命委员会。在当时革命工人队伍里，我比较年青，又认得几个字，大家推选我当书记。
    “从我们的革命政权成立的第一天起，工段上的旧知识分子、旧工程人员就向我们挑战。起初他们怠工，后来搅乱运输系统。斗争是严重的。我经常苦于缺乏技术、缺乏知识和经验。从那时起，我就衷心理解到：要支持苏维埃政权，就应该学会技术，学习丰富的知识。
    “我的理想不久实现了。1921年，我十九岁的时候，党选派了一部分工人进当地的大学工人补习班学习，我就是其中的一个。
      “多年来的理想不料一旦实现了。我带着兴奋和决心踏进了大学校门。那时的大学真像另一个世界。一天一个教授把我们找去，他轻蔑地瞟了我们一眼说：‘你们这批什么也不懂的工人，想念大学，想当工程师？！……’他的话气得我们调头就走了。
      “那时的大学里，教授、学生的思想是紊乱的。我还清楚地记得，有一次历史课教授在课堂上公开大叫：‘你们的苏维埃政权马上要完蛋！你们的新经济政策是资本主义复辟！’当时除了我们工人学生起来反对外，其他学生听了都是无动于衷。
    “情况对我们很不利的。如果我们不能在大学里建立起布尔什维克的影响，显然，我们想学习也是枉然的。于是我们工人学生先组织起来，成立了学生会。我们宣传布尔什维克的主张，一年中，我们争取了多数大学生，揭露了一部分教授的反动言行。我们胜利了。在工人补习班学习的第一年，实际又是一次尖锐的阶级斗争的锻炼。第二年起，我们才补习了一部分基本课程。
    “我真正地踏上科学之门，还是在二十三岁以后。1924年党送我进了尼齐内大学化学系学习，后来又转到莫斯科矿业学院学习。
    “对我说来，一个只懂得一些初级算术，既不懂高等数学，又不懂自然科学的工人，一下子跨进自然科学之门，困难之多是可以想像的。开初，上课听不懂，课后习题做不出，急得我真是坐卧不安。课余、傍晚，同学们有的去玩，有的在休息。我呢？我总是找几个工人学生悄悄地蹓进教室，关起门来，埋头学习。那时，我已是后补党员了，党是支持我克服困难的力量。
    “在我学习期间，伏尔加河沿岸闹大饥荒。我们工人学生一个月的口粮是六公斤扁豆。不够吃。我们能不能伸手向党要求增加口粮呢？不能，因为党处于非常困难的境地。我们五六个工人学生组织起来，轮流到外面去做工。黑夜带回一些黑面包，大家平分，一面吃，一面复习功课。
    “吃苦，受冻，学习非常紧张，有时使我们浑身没有一点劲儿。在没法忍受的时刻，想起旧工程人员的嘴脸，想起了多少建设工程正在等待着我们，我们身上便添了一股力量。
    “第一个五年计划期间，在一片荒凉的车里雅宾斯克开始建设第一座合金钢铁厂。全国展开了惊天动地的建设。这些也是帝国主义者永远不能理解的。无怪乎那时候他们讥讽我们，说我们的第一个五年计划不过是梦想。
    “这个合金钢厂，正像当时建设的其他工厂一样，是在十分困难的情况下建设起来的。你们可以想像：当时我们没有有经验的工程师，没有全套机器设备，一切都得用金子去购买。那时，我在矿业学院毕业后，来到了车里雅宾斯克合金钢厂。
      “第一座合金钢厂就在我们这些经验不多的工程师手中建造了起来。在那里，我受到了一生中最大的锻炼，它使我对苏维埃政权无往不胜的创造力，有了更坚定的信心。
    “譬如，当时我们没有炼合金钢的工人。夜晚，就把建筑工人、搬运工人集合起来。我给他们讲课：什么是合金，什么是原料，……苏维埃第一批合金工人队伍就是这样来的。
    “我们是边做边学，渐渐地掌握了一些经验的。每一个新的成绩都鼓舞着我们更加刻苦地研究。
      “冶炼特种合金钢是当时世界各国科学家们所共同关心的。1932年，党派我到外国考察实习了两年。回来之后，我专题研究冶炼特种合金钢。经过多次的反复的实验，我的研究最后成功了。
    “1944年，我荣获了劳动红旗勋章。战争结束不久，我被选为苏联科学院通讯院士。1946年到1951年期间我担任过苏联高等教育部副部长。
    “我们的科学家都是十分明确地知道自己是在为社会主义和共产主义事业服务的。政治领导科学，科学为政治目的服务。在一定意义上说，我们苏维埃科学家，也是政治活动家。我们把党的领导、党的指示作为我们研究工作的准则。工人阶级科学家的特点也就在这里。
      “四十年过去了，我们的国家日益繁荣、强大。我是随着苏维埃政权成长而成长起来的。我的一切成就，也就是党的成就。人们认为我是科学家，我自己认为，我也是一个学生。我是一边研究，一边教学，一边学习……。”
