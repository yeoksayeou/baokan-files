Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 25th: Heilongjiang Province has begun water conservancy construction to add another 1.5 million mu of paddy fields and prevent 3 million mu of farmland from flooding next year.

Currently, more than 30,000 people in more than 20 counties along the river and in flood-prone areas have started water conservancy projects in advance, and more than 30 other counties are actively preparing and will start work in full swing by the end of October.

This winter and spring, Heilongjiang Province will re-repair the Songhua River flood control embankment; build flood prevention networks and drainage ditches in flood-prone areas; build ponds and dams in mountainous areas to prevent mountain floods and store water for irrigation; and build various water conservancy projects in areas close to rivers to greatly develop paddy fields. It is expected that 70% of the 1.5 million mu of paddy field projects will be completed before the ground freezes this year, and the drainage projects will be completed by the end of the year.

Although the water conservancy project in the province was delayed for a month due to flood control, all localities have benefited greatly from water conservancy construction last year, so they are acting extremely quickly this year. Nehe County has already started construction. In order to ensure that the water conservancy project to expand paddy fields by more than 104,000 mu can be completed on schedule, Wuchang County has adopted the method of measuring, designing and constructing simultaneously. More than 100 technical cadres have been organized to provide specific guidance. Shuangcheng County has also drawn 10,000 laborers from the tense autumn harvest to build flood prevention networks in an effort to avoid flooding next year.

To ensure the quality of the projects, counties are training farmer water conservancy technicians. The Provincial Department of Water Conservancy has also sent more than 240 technical cadres to various localities to help with water conservancy projects.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st: The movement to build small reservoirs is rapidly unfolding in rural Zhejiang Province. More than 300 medium-sized and small reservoirs are currently under construction in the five special districts of Jinhua, Jiande, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Jiaxing, and many more reservoirs are being surveyed and designed in preparation for construction. The start time this year is generally more than a month earlier than in previous years.

Party and government leaders at all levels attach great importance to the construction of reservoirs. The provincial water conservancy conference held in early October organized all representatives to visit the reservoir project in Tongshan Township, Zhuji County. Many regions have held reservoir technology exchange meetings, organized on-site inspections, and promoted typical experiences. Yu Naiyi, Secretary of the Xuanping County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Xing Ruhai, the county magistrate, led more than 100 office cadres to the countryside to help build reservoirs.

Zhejiang Province plans to launch a "Ten Thousand Reservoirs Movement" during the Second Five-Year Plan period. This was recently determined by the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. More than 70% of the rural areas of Zhejiang are mountainous and semi-mountainous. The 2,726 small reservoirs built in the past eight years have irrigated more than 1.26 million mu of farmland, ensuring bumper harvests. If another 10,000 reservoirs are built in the next five years, another 6 million mu of farmland can be irrigated. Together with small water conservancy projects such as mountain ponds and dikes, the entire province can basically eliminate drought.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th: Shanxi Province is training 125,000 technical backbones in water conservancy and soil and water conservation to meet the needs of the upcoming high tide of agricultural capital construction. In Changzhi, Yanbei, Yuci and other regions where training is faster, more than 7,000 backbones have completed their training and returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural capital construction.

In general, all localities have adopted the practical method of using construction sites as schools, projects as teaching materials, and learning and working simultaneously to train technical backbones. This method enables trainees to master the general surveying and design and construction techniques in a relatively short period of time.

In recent years, Shanxi Province has paid great attention to cultivating and training technical backbones. At present, there are more than 150,000 technical backbones in water conservancy and soil and water conservation in the province. Technical guidance groups, technical exchange networks, and technical night schools, etc., with them as the core, are spread throughout the province. These organizations have played a greater role in agricultural capital construction over the years. They can not only study and solve technical problems in surveying, design and construction in a timely manner, but also the projects built under their guidance generally conform to the principle of spending less money, shorter time and greater benefits.

    千军万马大兴水利
    黑龙江三万农民提前施工
    浙江省大量修筑小型水库
    山西训练十二万技术人员
    新华社哈尔滨25日电　黑龙江省为明年再增加一百五十万亩水田和使三百万亩农田免除涝灾，动工兴修水利。
    全省沿江和易涝区的二十多个县，目前已有三万人提前动手兴修水利工程，其余三十多个县正在积极进行准备工作，10月底将全面开工。
    黑龙江省今冬明春将重新修整松花江防洪大堤；在易涝地区修防涝网和排涝沟；山区将修筑塘坝防御山洪和储水灌溉；在靠近江、河的地区，要修建各种水利工程，大量发展水田。预计一百五十万亩水田的工程将在今年结冻前完成70％，排涝工程将在年底全部完成。
    全省兴修水利工程虽因防汛而推迟了一个月，但各地由于去年修水利获得巨大的收益，所以今年行动极快，讷河县已开始施工。五常县为了保证扩大水田十万四千多亩的水利工程能按期完成，采取了边测量、边设计和边施工的方法。并组织了一百多名技术干部进行具体指导。双城县也在紧张的秋收中，抽出一万名劳动力修防涝网，以争取明年免除涝灾。
    为保证工程质量，各县正在训练农民水利技术员。省水利厅也派往各地二百四十多名技术干部，帮助兴修水利工程。
    新华社杭州21日电　兴修小型蓄水库运动正在浙江省农村迅速展开。金华、建德、温州、宁波、嘉兴五个专区目前已有三百多座中、小型水库动工兴建，还有很多水库正在勘察设计，准备施工。今年动工时间一般比往年提早一个月以上。
    各地党政领导很重视兴修水库工作。10月上旬召开的全省水利会议，曾组织全体代表参观诸暨县同山乡的水库工程。许多地区召开了水库技术交流会，组织实地观摩，推广典型经验。宣平县中共县委书记于耐毅、县长邢汝槐等，还带领一百多名机关干部下乡帮助修水库。
    浙江省计划在第二个五年计划期间，开展“万库运动”，这是中共浙江省委最近研究确定的。浙江农村70％以上是山区和半山区，过去八年来兴修的二千七百二十六座小型水库，使一百二十六万多亩田地得到灌溉，保障了丰收。今后五年再兴建一万座水库，便可再灌溉农田六百万亩，加上山塘堰坝等小型水利，全省就可基本上消灭旱灾。
    新华社太原24日电　山西省正在训练十二万五千名水利和水土保持技术骨干分子，以适应即将到来的农业基本建设高潮的需要。训练工作较快的长治、雁北、榆次等地区，目前已有七千多名骨干分子受训完毕后回乡参加农业基本建设。
    各地训练技术骨干分子一般都采用了以工地为学校、工程为教材和边讲边学边作的联系实际的方法。这种方法能使学员在较短的时间内掌握一般的勘测设计和施工的技术。
    最近几年，山西省很注意培养和训练技术骨干分子。现在，全省已有水利和水土保持技术骨干分子十五万多人。各地并以他们为核心组成的技术辅导组、技术交流网、技术夜校等组织，遍布全省。这些组织在历年来的农业基本建设中发挥了较大的作用，他们不仅能及时研究解决勘测设计施工中的技术问题，而且经他们指导兴修的工程，一般都符合花钱少、时间短、收效大的原则。
