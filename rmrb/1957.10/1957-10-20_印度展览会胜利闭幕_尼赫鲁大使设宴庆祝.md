Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Indian Exhibition received its last group of visitors on the 19th and closed at 5:00 PM.

The Indian Exhibition was originally scheduled to close on October 9th, but the exhibition period was extended by ten days due to the demands of the audience. By today, the number of visitors had reached more than 1,080,000. By the afternoon of the 17th, more than 180,000 people had received commemorative badges from the Indian Exhibition. Many people sent various souvenirs from the exhibition to relatives and friends. Some people even wrote letters from border areas such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Yunnan, requesting the exhibition to give them a commemorative badge or a picture as a symbol of friendship between the Chinese and Indian people. The twenty-six Indian films screened at the exhibition were almost always sold out, with more than 20,000 viewers.

During this period, the Indian Exhibition also received many congratulatory letters from the Chinese people.

The head of the Indian Exhibition Delegation, Panikkar, told reporters on the 19th: "From the face of every visitor, from the enthusiastic greetings of every Chinese child, I saw the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Indian people, and I saw the bright future of Indo-Chinese trade."

Indian Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China, R.K. Nehru, hosted a banquet at the Peace Hotel tonight to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Indian Exhibition. R.K. Nehru said at the banquet that when the exhibition opened, he said that the main purpose of this exhibition was to enhance the friendship between the people of India and China. Now, it has achieved this goal. The people of India and China need to understand and learn from each other, which is of great significance to promoting the friendship between the people of India and China and promoting peace in Asia and the world.
