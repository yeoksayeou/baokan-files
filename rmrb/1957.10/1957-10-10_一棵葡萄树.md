    A Grapevine
    Wang Qiao
    There's a grapevine in my yard, said to have been planted by my grandfather when he was young. As far back as I can remember, this tree has been as thick as a bowl, with green branches and vines, and hand-shaped leaves that shade the yard and cover the roof. Under the grape trellis, my grandmother told me the story of Wu Song fighting the tiger, and my mother, pointing to the twinkling stars, told me the story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl. The moonlight, filtering through the dense branches and leaves, sprinkled onto the ground, resembling a printed carpet, and the ignorant me, had rolled on this "printed carpet." When I was little, I often climbed that curved, dragon-like trunk, scraping off the bark and polishing the trunk. I also climbed onto the roof to steal the half-ripe grapes. Thinking about it, my family's grapevine is really good, with dense bunches of grapes, weighing the branches into bows and the vines into hooks. When the grapes ripen, they are translucent, and if you look closely, the grape juice seems to be flowing, as if about to burst through the skin. My grandmother said these grapes are called "White Grapes," juicy, seedless, sweet, and not sour, a rare and fine variety.
    When I grew to be ten years old, my grandmother passed away, and my father and uncle often fought, often ending up with black eyes and swollen noses. It was said to be about money. Later, I don't know how, my mother and aunt also quarreled. Although they stirred the ladle in the same pot, when they met, they pouted and glared. Later, they separated the family.
    The autumn of the year of the family separation, the grapes ripened. To pick the grapes, my father and my uncle, my mother and my aunt, launched a great melee. Scared the little children crying loudly. The story went like this: When the family separated, the homestead was divided according to the ancient rule of elder brother south, younger brother north. My father, being the eldest, naturally lived in the south, and the grapevine grew in the south, so it naturally belonged to my family. That is, on the morning of the fight, my father, my mother, and I, first went to my uncle's house to pick grapes. I picked and ate, as happy as if it were the New Year, not caring about the cobwebs sticking to my face. Just as we were picking happily, my uncle came.
    "Who told you to steal my grapes?" A loud roar startled me. He stood under the eaves, head held high, hands on his hips, anger spitting from his big eyes, murderous intent flashing on his dark red face.
    "Picking mine, how is it stealing? Watch your mouth." My father retorted, my mother looked flustered, she was afraid of fighting.
    "Yours? Who gave it to you? Is it written in the division agreement?"
    "The grapevine grows on my property, the grapes are naturally mine to pick!"
    "The grapes grow on my roof, so they are mine to pick."
    My father came down from the roof, and my mother and I also came down. The brothers hadn't said three words when they started fighting. One grabbed the other's collar, heads butting. My father moved forward two steps, and my uncle retreated two steps; my uncle moved forward two steps, and my father retreated two steps. My mother saw that my father was about to lose, so she joined the battle. My aunt saw my mother join the battle, so she came up and fought with my mother. I didn't dare go near, so I cried and went out to call for someone to break up the fight. When they were pulled apart, both sides had injuries, my father lost two front teeth, and my uncle had two swollen eyes; my mother's hair was disheveled, and my aunt's collar was torn. It was time for lunch, and people dispersed, probably because they were hungry, and both sides withdrew.
    The next day, when I woke up, the yard was full of grape branches and vines, and the grape trellis had collapsed. It turned out that on the night of the quarrel, my father, unable to contain his anger, cut off the grape branches and vines level with our roof. At that time, I was extremely sad, I cried for the disintegration of the green canopy. Crying, I mixed mud to bandage the grapevine's wounds. When my uncle saw this, his anger erupted like a volcano. Not far from the roots of the grapevine was the area allocated to him. He took a hoe and shovel and dug a ditch there. The ditch grew longer and longer, more than ten feet long; the ditch grew deeper and deeper, more than eight feet deep. He dug out all the grapevine roots that had grown to his side. Then he filled the ditch with bricks and tiles. He said: You won't let me eat grapes, and although I can't kill it, it can't live. Later, the two families often quarreled and fought over the boundary of the land. I often saw my father measuring the land, sometimes using a rope. Although my mother and aunt lived in the same yard, they didn't speak to each other. If my uncle's chickens ran into our yard, my mother would scold and chase them away; if our pigs ran to my uncle's side, my aunt would scold and beat them. Even if we children played with my uncle's children, we would be scolded by the adults: good for nothings, no "ambition" at all! Why were brothers like enemies? Little me, puzzled.
    After Liberation, I grew up and joined the revolution, not knowing what was happening at home. I thought, after the land reform and the collectivization, the brothers should have reconciled! I asked for leave to go home and see. Sitting on the train, the past of the grapevine was vivid in my mind, but what was it like now? Was it dead or alive?
    I got off the train, walked out of the station, and got lost. I clearly remembered that the station was only five li away from my home. If I walked straight north and then turned east, I could see the dilapidated spire and the dense reed garden. Now, before my eyes were tall chimneys, spewing white smoke; white water towers, shining in the sun. Trucks hauling materials went back and forth, and a cloud of dust covered the pedestrians and vehicles. I had to rest every five steps and stop every ten steps to ask for directions. As I walked, the spire and reed garden flashed into view. I swung my arms, my arms seemed to grow wings; I strode forward, my feet seemed to be fitted with springs. When I reached the village, I tidied my clothes, brushed off the dust, washed my face in the clear stream, and walked into the village with my chest out.
    At home, my parents, brothers and sisters were overjoyed. After a while, my uncle and aunt also came, asking if I was hungry or thirsty, asking this and that, as if their own child had returned from afar. From their attitude, they were also extraordinarily affectionate to my parents. When my uncle and aunt were about to leave, my mother insisted on stuffing the sweets I brought back into her arms. After I saw my uncle off, I looked up and saw that the grape trellis had been rebuilt, and the green canopy had formed again. The green branches and vines were happily climbing towards my uncle's roof. My mother saw me staring at the grapevine, and said to me: "The grapevine is like people, the older it gets, the younger it becomes. Since the implementation of collectivization, the land is connected and people's hearts are connected, and our family and your uncle's family have reconciled. Your uncle is a party member, and his thinking is progressive. He first dug out the bricks and tiles under the roots of the grapevine, and filled the ditch with oily black soil, the roots took hold, and the tree recovered.
    "One day, your uncle suddenly came to our house, carrying a pot of wine in his hand, and your aunt brought a plate of stir-fried dishes behind your uncle. As soon as your uncle stepped over the threshold, he said with a smile: 'Brother, I've come to apologize.' For nearly ten years, the two families hadn't spoken, what was going on? Your father and I were stunned, like monks eight feet tall, unable to figure it out. Then, your father greeted your uncle with a red face, and the brothers drank, ate, and talked. Your uncle confessed that he shouldn't have treated your father that way in the past, saying that it was the harm of private land ownership, saying that the boundaries of the land separated people's hearts, turning brothers into enemies. Your father also confessed, and both old men shed tears when they talked about the past hardships. Later, your father said that now is a good time, don't mention sad things, he insisted on calling your aunt and children to come, and the two families had a reunion drink. Your father also asked me to stir-fry dishes and warm wine. They talked and drank, chattering and drinking, and made a fuss until midnight..." At this moment, my aunt brought me dumplings, interrupting my mother's words.
    "Xue'er, try the dumplings your aunt made for you!"
    "There's some here too, why bother so much?"
    "Sister-in-law, Xue'er is away from home all year round, it's not easy for him to eat my cooking!" She turned to me and said, "Xue'er, eat quickly, I'll serve you more when you finish." Saying that, she left.
    I ate the dumplings, chewing, and I was deeply moved. This is the revival of human love, the rebirth of brotherly affection. This affection, like the newly grown branches and vines on the grapevine, is thriving, and like the ripening grapes, it is shining brightly.

    一棵葡萄树
    王桥
    我家院里有棵葡萄树，听说是我爷爷年轻时候栽的。打我记事起，这棵树就有碗口粗，绿色的枝蔓，手掌样的叶子，遮了院子，盖了房顶。在葡萄架下，奶奶给我讲过武松打虎的故事，妈妈指着眨眼的星星，给我讲过牛郎织女的故事。月光透过密密的枝叶，洒到地上，俨若印花地毡，不懂事的我，也曾在这“印花毡”上打过滚。小时候，我也常常攀上那弯曲如龙的树身，蹬掉树皮，磨光了树身。也曾爬上屋顶，偷吃那半熟的葡萄。想起来，我家这棵葡萄树实在好，繁繁的葡萄嘟噜，压得树枝成弓蔓成钩。当葡萄熟了的时候，透亮透亮，倘细细端详，葡萄汁好像在流动，好像要破皮而出。奶奶说这葡萄，叫“白葡萄”，水多没籽，味甜不酸，是不可多得的良种。
    等我长到十岁的时候，奶奶去世，我爸和我叔常打架，往往打得鼻青眼肿。据说是为了钱。后来，不知怎么的，我妈和我婶也吵架。虽在一个锅里搅杓把，但见了面，都嘴噘脸吊。后来，就分家了。
    分家那一年秋天，葡萄熟了。为了摘葡萄，我爸和我叔，我妈和我婶，展开了大混战。吓得我们小娃娃哇哇直哭。事情经过是这样：分家的时候，庄基按哥南弟北的古规分定。我爸为长，自然住在南边，葡萄树长在南边，当然属我家。就是打架这天早晨，我爸我妈和我，先到我叔叔的房上去摘葡萄。我一边摘，一边吃，高兴得像过年似的，蛛网沾了一脸，也不在乎。我们摘的正高兴的时候，我叔父来了。
    “谁叫你偷我的葡萄？”一声巨响，吓得我打颤。他站在屋底下，昂着头，双手叉腰，大眼睛里吐着怒火，黑红的脸膛上闪着杀气。
    “摘我的，怎是偷？口里干净点。”我爸答了腔，我妈神色有些慌张，她怕打架。
    “你的，谁分给你的，分书上写着么？”
    “葡萄树长到我的地方，葡萄当然该我摘！”
    “葡萄结到我的房上，就该我摘。”
    我爸从房上下来了，我妈和我也下来了。弟兄俩三言两语没说到一起，就动起武来。一个扯着一个的领口，头顶着头。我爸前进两步，我叔就后退两步；我叔前进两步，我爸就后退两步。我妈看我爸快要败下阵来，就参战了。我婶看我妈参战，就上来和我妈厮打。我也不敢到跟前去，就哭着出去喊人拉架。拉开，双方互有损伤，我爸的门牙落了两个，我叔眼睛肿了一双；我妈发髻紊乱，我婶的衣襟已烂。吃响午饭了，人都散去，大概肚子饿了，双方才收兵回营。
    第二天，我一起来，院子里堆满了葡萄枝蔓，葡萄架倒了下来。原来在吵架的当天夜里，我爸气不过，就齐我家房檐将葡萄枝蔓砍断了。那时候，我难过极了，我哭绿色凉棚的瓦解。我哭着合泥，将葡萄树的伤口包扎。叔父一看这情景，怒气像火山样爆发了。离葡萄树根不远，就是分给他的地方。他拿着镢头锨，在那儿挖沟。沟越挖越长，足有丈余；沟越挖越深，足有八尺。将扎到他那边的葡萄树根全挖出来。然后他用砖头瓦片，填满了沟。他说：你不叫我吃葡萄，我虽不能叫它死，可它也活不成。后来，两家为了地畔也常吵嘴打架。我常见我爸在地头上量来量去，有时还用绳子量。我妈和我婶虽住在一个院，也不说话，叔叔的鸡跑到我家，我妈就骂着赶；我家的猪跑到叔叔那边，婶婶就骂着打。就是我们这些小娃娃若和我叔家的孩子玩耍，就会遭到大人申斥：没血鬼，没一点“志气”！亲兄弟为什么像仇人？小小的我，惑然不解。
    解放了，我长大了，参加了革命，不知道家里怎样？我想，土改了，合作化了，兄弟俩该和好了吧！我请假回家来看看。坐在火车上，葡萄树的往事，历历在目，但它现在怎样了？是死是活？
    我下了火车，走出车站，迷路了。我清楚记得，车站离我家只五里地，端向北走，再向东一拐，就可以看见那破旧的尖塔，密密的苇园。现在，眼前是高大的烟囱，冒着白烟；白色的水塔，在太阳下闪光。拉材料的汽车南来北往，尘土的雾，罩着行人车马。我只得五步一歇，十步一停地问路。走着走着，尖塔苇园闪进眼里。我甩起胳膊，胳膊像长了翅膀；我迈开大步，脚下像装上弹簧。到村跟前，我整整衣服，弹弹尘土，在清澈的溪水中洗了脸，挺胸往村里走去。
    到家里，可乐坏了父母弟妹。一时，我叔和我婶也来了，问饥问渴，问这问那，像是他们的孩子从远方归来。从态度上看，和我父母也亲热异常。叔叔婶婶临走时，我妈将我带回来的糖果硬塞到她的怀里。等我将叔叔送走，抬头一看，葡萄架又搭起来了，绿色的凉棚又形成了。那绿色的枝蔓，欣欣然向我叔父房顶爬去。我妈看我对葡萄树出神，妈妈就对我说：“葡萄树和人一样，越活越年轻了。自从实行了合作化，土地连片人就连心了，咱和你叔家就和好了。你叔是个党员，思想进步嘛。他先把葡萄树根下的砖头瓦渣刨去，并用油黑的土填了沟，树根扎过去，树病就好了。
    “有一天，你叔叔突然来咱家，手里提着一壶酒，你婶端了盘炒菜在你叔身后。你叔脚刚迈进门坎，就笑嘻嘻地说：‘哥，我赔不是来了。’近十年，两家没说过话，这可是怎么回事。我和你爸都楞住了，丈二高的和尚，摸不住头脑。接着，你爸红着脸招呼你叔，弟兄俩就喝着吃着说着。你叔检讨说，他过去不该那样待你爸，说那是受了土地私有的害，说是地畔子把人心隔开，将亲兄弟变成仇人。你爸也检讨啦，两个老头子，说起过去的艰难都落泪了。后来，你爸说，现在是好日子，不提伤心事，他硬叫你叔将你婶和娃娃都叫来，两家喝个团圆酒。你爸又叫我炒菜温酒。东扯葫芦西扯瓢地说着、喝着，直闹腾到半夜。……”这时，我婶给我将饺子端来，才打断了我妈的话。
    “学儿，你尝尝婶婶给你包的饺子！”
    “这边也有，你可费那神干啥？”
    “嫂，学儿长年在外，他吃我做的饭也不容易啊！”她又转过来对我说，“学儿。快吃，吃完婶给你盛。”说着就走了。
    我吃着饺子，咀嚼着，我深深地感动了。这是人间友爱的复活，手足情谊的再生。这情谊，也像葡萄树上新生的枝蔓那样欣欣向荣，也像将熟的葡萄那样闪光发亮。
