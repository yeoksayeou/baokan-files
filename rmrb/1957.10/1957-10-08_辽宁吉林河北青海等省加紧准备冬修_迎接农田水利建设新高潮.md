Xinhua News Agency report: Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei and Qinghai provinces are actively preparing to greet a new upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction.

    Liaoning Province plans to expand the irrigated area of ​​farmland by 100,000 hectares, the drainage area by 320,000 hectares, and the soil and water conservation area by more than 260,000 hectares next year. This was decided at the Liaoning Provincial Farmland Water Conservancy Conference. The conference requested that publicity and education work be done well to welcome the new upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction, construction plans for autumn and winter repairs should be compiled, various preparations for autumn and winter repairs should be actively carried out, construction should be started as early as possible, and efforts should be made to complete more than 60% of the annual construction plan for next year in autumn and winter.

    The Jilin Provincial Farmland Water Conservancy Conference, which recently closed, studied the specific matters for carrying out water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, and put forward a plan to expand the irrigated area by more than 430,000 hectares during the second five-year plan period. This figure is more than the total irrigated area expanded in Jilin Province in nearly a hundred years. In 1958, the irrigated area will be expanded by more than 100,000 hectares, half of which is required to be completed this year.

    The irrigated area of ​​farmland in Jilin Province was only more than 110,000 hectares in 1952, but this year it has increased to more than 360,000 hectares, accounting for 7.6% of the total cultivated land area. Wherever dry land is irrigated, the yield per hectare is increased by 500 to 1,000 jin. According to calculations, the increase in paddy fields in Jilin Province during the first five-year plan period has increased the province's grain output by more than 750 million jin. At present, various parts of the province are actively preparing to welcome this upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction.

    Hebei Province is making active preparations for launching an upsurge in water conservancy construction this winter and next spring. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has organized leading cadres from various special districts and counties to visit typical projects such as well irrigation and water and soil conservation in Xingtang, Zhangjiakou, and Tianjin.

    At present, mountainous areas are surveying reservoirs and canals, while agricultural production cooperatives in plain areas are digging new wells and repairing old wells and deep cone wells damaged by floods last year.

    After completing this year's plan to expand the irrigated area by 150,000 mu, farmers of all ethnic groups on the Qinghai Plateau decided to build another 50,000 mu of small-scale water conservancy irrigation projects this winter. As of now, there are about 1.7 million mu of irrigated land on the Qinghai Plateau, which is almost two and a half times the area of ​​irrigated land before liberation, with an average of more than 1.2 mu per person. Due to the complex terrain of the Qinghai Plateau, farmers of all ethnic groups use methods such as repairing canals, digging wells, opening low-lying areas, building reservoirs, and expanding spring eyes to divert and store all available water sources according to various terrains and natural characteristics.

    辽宁吉林河北青海等省加紧准备冬修
    迎接农田水利建设新高潮
    据新华社讯　辽宁、吉林、河北和青海等省农民积极迎接农田水利建设新高潮。
    辽宁省明年要扩大农田灌溉面积十万公顷、排涝面积三十二万公顷、水土保持面积二十六万多公顷。这是辽宁省农田水利会议决定的。会议要求做好迎接农田水利建设新高潮的宣传教育工作，编制好秋修冬修施工计划，积极做好秋修冬修工程的各项准备工作，尽量提早施工，力争秋冬完成明年全年施工计划的60％以上。
    吉林省最近闭幕的全省农田水利会议，研究了今冬明春开展水利建设的具体事项，并提出了在第二个五年计划期间扩大灌溉面积四十三万多公顷的计划。这个数字比吉林省近百年来扩大的灌溉面积的总和还多。1958年就要扩大灌溉面积十万公顷以上，其中有一半要求在今年完成。
    吉林省的农田灌溉面积1952年只有十一万多公顷，今年就增加到了三十六万多公顷，占总耕地面积的7.6％。凡是经过水浇的旱田，每公顷产量提高五百斤到一千斤。据计算，第一个五年计划期间吉林省增加的水田，使全省增产了七亿五千多万斤粮食。目前，省内各地正在为迎接这个农田水利建设的高潮积极地进行准备。
    河北省正在为今冬明春开展水利建设高潮进行积极准备。中共河北省委已组织了各专区、县党、政领导干部分赴行唐、张家口、天津参观井灌、水土保持等典型工程。
    现在，山区正在勘测水库、渠道等，平原地区的农业生产合作社，正在打新井，修复去年水灾损坏的旧井和深锥井。
    青海高原上的各族农民在完成了今年扩大十五万亩灌溉面积的计划以后，决定今冬再增修五万亩小型水利灌溉工程。截至目前，青海高原上共有水浇地约一百七十万亩，差不多等于解放前水浇地面积的两倍半，平均每人有一亩二分多。青海高原地势复杂，各族农民根据各种地形和自然特点，分别用修渠、打井、开洼地、筑水库、扩大泉眼等办法，引蓄一切可以利用的水源。
