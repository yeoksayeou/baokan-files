Training Health Personnel; Establishing a Comprehensive Prevention and Control Network
Kala-azar Incidence Decreases Year by Year

    This report states that in recent years, great achievements have been made in the prevention and control of kala-azar, and the nationwide elimination of kala-azar can be realized soon.
    Kala-azar is prevalent in the vast rural areas north of the Yangtze River in China, distributed across thirteen provinces. In severely affected areas such as the Huaiyin Special Zone in Jiangsu, 82% of villages were affected by kala-azar, with an incidence rate of about 32% of the local population, and the mortality rate was also extremely high. Since liberation, under the care of the Party and the government, specialized institutions and prevention and control organizations at all levels have been established, primarily in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces. A comprehensive prevention and control network was organized, and a large number of professional personnel and grassroots health workers were trained to carry out large-scale prevention and control work. In recent years, the national incidence of kala-azar has decreased by 75%, and it is currently estimated to be no more than 160,000 people. The incidence rate has decreased in many areas, and some areas have basically eliminated kala-azar. For example, there are currently only about 2,000 kala-azar patients left in Jiangsu, and the Huaiyin area has basically eliminated kala-azar. In Henan Province, the number of kala-azar patients has decreased by 75%. Among them, in Shangqiu County, a severely affected area, 399 of the 745 natural villages have no kala-azar patients, and the number of kala-azar patients is decreasing year by year in 339 villages. In Linqu County, Changwei Special Zone, Shandong, the incidence rate has also decreased from 76 per 10,000 to 6.6 per 10,000. Significant reductions have been achieved in other regions as well.
    Because the drugs for preventing and treating kala-azar can be produced domestically and are very effective, it also provides favorable conditions for the early elimination of kala-azar. At present, domestically produced sodium stibogluconate pentavalent antimony preparations are used clinically throughout the country, using a method of injecting six needles in six days. After one or two courses of treatment, the cure rate is 96.6% to 97.4%. In terms of eliminating the sandflies that transmit the disease, domestically produced DDT and BHC are very effective. For example, in Taian County, Shandong, the incidence rate dropped rapidly after applying these two drugs, and no new patients have been found in the past three years. These drugs are currently being widely promoted and used in various regions.

    训练卫生人员　建立周密防治网
    黑热病患病率逐年降低
    本报讯　几年来，黑热病的防治工作取得很大成绩，全国基本上消灭黑热病不久即可实现。
    黑热病流行在我国长江以北的广大农村，分布地区达十三个省。严重的地区如江苏淮阴专区，82％的村庄流行黑热病，发病率达当地人口的32％左右，病死率也极高。解放以来，在党和政府的关怀下，首先在山东、江苏等省建立了专业机构和逐级的防治机构，组织了周密的防治网，培养和训练了大批专业人员和基层卫生人员，展开了大规模的防治工作。几年来，全国黑热病患病率已下降了75％，目前估计不超过十六万人。不少地区患病率下降，有的地区已基本消灭了黑热病，如江苏目前只剩下黑热病患者二千人左右，淮阴地区已基本消灭了黑热病。河南省黑热病患病人数下降了75％，其中严重流行区商丘县的七百四十五个自然村中，有三百九十九个村已无黑热病人，有三百三十九个村黑热病人逐年减少。山东昌潍专区临朐县的发病率也由万分之七十六降低到六点六。其他地区都有显著的降低。
    由于防治黑热病的药物能够自给，而且效果很好，也给早日消灭黑热病提供了有利条件。目前在临床治疗方面各地都采用国产的葡萄糖酸锑钠五价锑剂，采取六天注射六针的方法，经过一两个疗程，病愈率达96.6％至97.4％。在扑灭传染媒介白蛉子方面，国产的二二三和六六六的效果都非常好，如山东泰安县施用这二种药剂后，发病率迅即下降，近三年来已无新病人发现。目前各地都在普遍推广使用。
