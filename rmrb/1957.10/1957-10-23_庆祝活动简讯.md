Celebration Activities Briefs

    Jinan Propaganda Activities are Diverse

    Jinan has already widely launched propaganda activities to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    The Jinan Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has begun to widely hold thematic report meetings on "Soviet Friendship to China," "The Great International Significance of the October Revolution," and "Artificial Satellites" among factories, schools, troops stationed in Jinan, and cadres of government organizations. The leading organs of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Jinan requested subordinate units to closely integrate the propaganda for the October Revolution Day with socialist education, to educate officers and soldiers to further learn from the Soviet people's spirit of building the country and the army with diligence and thrift, and of hard struggle, to strengthen the unity of officers and soldiers, and to strengthen the relationship between the military and the people.

    Many factories in Jinan have published special issues on their workshop blackboards, featuring workers' thoughts on the October Revolution, clapper rhymes, and propaganda posters. Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, a state-owned enterprise, also used the factory newspaper and radio station to publicize the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to China by combining it with examples from the factory. They are also preparing to invite Soviet experts to give thematic speeches on the October Revolution. Shandong Institute of Technology, Medical College, and many middle and primary schools in Jinan have also held small-scale Soviet picture exhibitions, report meetings, and story-telling sessions.

    Garrison Troops in Various Places Carry Out Celebration Activities

    Garrison troops of the People's Liberation Army in various places are actively carrying out various activities to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    The great achievements of the Soviet Union in artificial satellites and intercontinental ballistic missiles have aroused great interest among the broad masses of officers and soldiers. The Nanjing Military Club has been continuously organizing special reports on intercontinental ballistic missiles since the 18th. On the 11th, the leading organs of the troops stationed in Guangzhou organized a report meeting on artificial satellites with more than 3,000 officers participating.

    The leading organs of the troops stationed in Guangzhou are preparing an exhibition of Soviet revolutionary history and Soviet army heroes, as well as an exhibition of Soviet literary works, and are preparing to send pictures such as "Forty Years of Soviet Construction" and "The Great Sino-Soviet Friendship" to the coastal defense troops for a tour exhibition.

    Officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Lushun-Dalian have written congratulatory letters to the Soviet officers and soldiers who had been stationed in Lushun to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is preparing to hold a get-together with Soviet experts who are assisting in their work, and the leading organs have issued a call to subordinate units to further learn from the Soviet Union's advanced scientific experience.

    Esperantists Gather to Celebrate

    The All-China Esperanto League held a meeting in Beijing on the morning of the 20th to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Participants included Esperantists from various government organizations and schools in Beijing. Professor Armand, the chief expert of the Soviet Esperantist and Yellow River Expedition Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Mr. and Mrs. Salutz, German Esperantists now in Beijing, also attended the meeting. The commemorative meeting passed a telegram to the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to congratulate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, and presented a banner and a commemorative signature satin to Soviet Esperantists.
