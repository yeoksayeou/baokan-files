The Soviet Republics

　　Uzbekistan, Producer of “White Gold”
　　Editor's Note: The Soviet Union is a large multinational family, composed of fifteen union republics. To help readers understand the Soviet Union as we welcome the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we are launching the "Soviet Republics" column today to introduce the general situation of each republic.

　　The Uzbek Republic, located in the heart of Central Asia, is one of the fifteen fraternal republics of the Soviet Union. It is the Soviet Union's storehouse of cotton, silk, and lambskins. Its cotton accounts for two-thirds of the Soviet Union's total output, silk accounts for one-half, and Karakul lambskins are a particularly valuable product renowned far and wide.

　　Central Asia is a region with abundant sunshine and little rainfall. There are many deserts and arid grasslands. Therefore, water is life, prosperity, and happiness. As the Uzbek proverb says, "Where there is water, there is life; where water is exhausted, life withers."

　　The land of Uzbekistan is home to the largest oasis in Central Asia—the Fergana Valley. Its irrigation network is interwoven like a spider web, bringing the source of life to the people. So, if Uzbekistan is a wealthy producer of cotton, silk, and lambskins, then the Fergana Plain is like a huge pearl on the head of this wealthy man. The plain is covered with white gold—cotton, and everywhere are lush mulberry trees and orchards. This is the result of the hard work of irrigation experts and cotton-growing experts who have struggled for water for centuries. The Fergana Grand Canal, excavated in 1939, is 340 kilometers long and brings life and happiness to 445,000 hectares of arid grassland. Before the revolution, in 1913, the year with the highest cotton production, the republic had 518,000 tons. But in 1956, Uzbekistan supplied the country with 2,858,000 tons of cotton, more than five times that amount. This year, it will harvest at least three million tons of cotton.

　　Soviet power has brought earth-shaking changes to the Uzbek Republic. It has transformed this backward region, filled with feudal remnants, into a prosperous socialist country. In the Tsarist era, there were only four students for every thousand Uzbeks. But now, there are 34 institutions of higher learning with more than 71,000 university students. There are more than 1.3 million primary school students and 162 newspapers published in Uzbek. This is the best proof of the republic's highly developed culture for a republic with a population of 7.3 million. Women, like in our country, have been liberated by the Communist Party. In the past, Uzbekistan favored men over women and practiced polygamy. Women had to wear black veils when they went out. Now, women work and study just like men. Many women have become collective farm chairpersons or Soviet representatives, and even more are doctors and teachers.

　　The industry of the Uzbek Republic has also been established. Now it can manufacture cotton pickers, tractors, textile machines, and so on. The total industrial output has increased more than fifty times compared to 1924. The petroleum industry in the Fergana Valley is also booming, the Angren coal deposits have been vigorously exploited, and power stations have been built one after another. In 1956, electricity production increased almost 1,300 times compared to 1913. Since last year, the working people of Uzbekistan have begun to march towards the "Hungry Steppe," a barren desert since ancient times. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they are going to turn this desert into a green garden and make it a place that also produces "white gold." In seven months, 8,000 hectares of land have been reclaimed, and a new city—Yangiyer—has been born on the steppe. In five or six years, this "Hungry Steppe" will not only no longer be "hungry," but it will also provide the country with 320,000 to 340,000 tons of cotton. When the second phase of the project is completed in the future, it will produce 1.2 million to 1.5 million tons of cotton, much more than what Egypt currently produces!

　　The capital of the republic, Tashkent, is an ancient and beautiful city. In the Tsarist era, it was the center of the Turkestan Governor-General's territory, which included all of Central Asia. Now it has more than doubled in size. It is the largest city in all of Central Asia. (Jun) (Attached picture)

### 出产“白金”的乌兹别克

专栏：苏联的加盟共和国

　　出产“白金”的乌兹别克
    编者按　苏联是一个多民族的大家庭，它由十五个加盟共和国组成。在迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，为帮助读者了解苏联，特自今日起辟“苏联的加盟共和国”一栏，陆续介绍各共和国的概况。
    中亚细亚中部的乌兹别克共和国，是苏联十五个兄弟共和国中的一个。这是苏联棉花、蚕丝和羔皮的仓库。它的棉花占苏联总产量的三分之二，蚕丝占二分之一，而卡拉库里羊的羔皮是一种远近驰名的特别贵重的产品。
    中亚细亚是阳光多、水分少的地方。这里有许多沙漠和干旱的草原。所以水就是生命，就是繁荣和幸福。乌兹别克的谚语说得好：“那里有水，那里就有生活；那里水尽，那里的生活也就枯竭。”
    乌兹别克斯坦的土地上，有中亚最大的绿洲——费尔干谷地。这里的灌溉网像蜘蛛网一样交织着，把生命的水源带给了人们。所以如果说乌兹别克斯坦是一位棉、丝和羔皮的富翁，那么费尔干平原就像这位富翁头上的一颗巨大的珍珠。平原上遍地是白色的金子——棉花，到处是枝叶茂密的桑树和果园。这是为水斗争了几世纪的灌溉能手们和植棉能手们的辛勤劳动的成果。1939年开掘的费尔干大运河，长达三百四十公里，给四十四万五千公顷干旱的草原带来了生命和幸福的水。共和国的棉花，在革命前1913年是产量最高的一年，有五十一万八千吨，可是1956年，乌兹别克供给国家的棉花已经达到了二百八十五万八千吨，增加为五倍以上。今年则至少要收三百万吨棉花。
    苏维埃政权使乌兹别克共和国发生了天翻地覆的变化。使这个充满了封建残余的落后地区，一跃而变成了繁荣的社会主义国度。沙皇时代，每一千个乌兹别克人中只有四个学生。可是现在，只高等学校就有三十四所，有七万一千多名大学生。小学生有一百三十多万，有一百六十二种用乌兹别克文出版的报纸。这对于有七百三十万人口的共和国说来，是它的文化高度发达的最好证明。妇女们也像我国一样，共产党使她们翻了身。过去的乌兹别克重男轻女，实行一夫多妻制。妇女出门要蒙上黑色的面纱。现在妇女和男人们一样工作和学习。许多妇女做了集体农庄主席或苏维埃代表，做医生、教师的就更多了。
    乌兹别克共和国的工业也建立起来了。现在它能够制造摘棉机、拖拉机、纺织机等等。工业生产总量已增加到1924年的五十倍以上了。费尔干谷地的石油工业也蓬勃地发展起来了，安格伦的煤藏也得到了大力开采，发电站相继建立，1956年的电力生产几乎增加到1913年的一千三百倍。从去年起，乌兹别克的劳动人民又开始向自古以来干旱不毛的荒漠——“饥饿草原”进军了。他们在共产党的领导下，要把这荒漠变成绿色的花园，要使它也成为出产“白金”的地方。七个月的时间，就已开垦了八千公顷土地，草原上已经诞生了一个新城市——扬吉埃尔。五、六年后，这“饥饿草原”就不但不再是“饥饿”的，而且还要给国家三十二万吨到三十四万吨棉花。将来到第二期工程完成后，它就会生产一百二十万到一百五十万吨棉花，比埃及目前出产的棉花还要多得多！
    共和国首都塔什干是古老而又美丽的城市。它在沙俄时代是包括整个中亚细亚在内的土耳其斯坦总督辖区的中心。现在它已比从前扩大了一倍。是整个中亚细亚最大的城市。　　　（君）（附图片）
