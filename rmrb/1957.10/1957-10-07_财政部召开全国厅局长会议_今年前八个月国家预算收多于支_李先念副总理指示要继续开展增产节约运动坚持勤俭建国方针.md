The Ministry of Finance Convenes National Conference of Department and Bureau Chiefs
National Budget Revenue Exceeds Expenditures in the First Eight Months of This Year
Vice Premier Li Xiannian Instructs to Continue Launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement and Adhere to the Policy of Building the Country Through Diligence and Thrift

(Our dispatch) This recently concluded conference of finance department and bureau chiefs from all provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities was satisfied to point out that the execution of the national budget in the first eight months of this year was basically good.

This conference was convened by the Ministry of Finance from September 3rd to 29th. The conference reviewed the execution of the 1957 national budget and arranged the targets for local budget revenue and expenditures for 1958.

The review indicated that the execution of the national budget revenue and expenditures from January to August 1957 was basically good. The reasons are mainly: First, the victory of the socialist transformation and the leap forward in capital construction in 1956 created extremely favorable conditions for the development of construction undertakings in 1957. Second, the in-depth launch of the increase production and practice economy movement this year has resulted in industrial production, transportation, and commodity circulation all exceeding the original plans. This is an important reason why budget revenue exceeded expenditures. Third, although some areas experienced varying degrees of disaster this year, the overall harvest situation nationwide is generally good. The conference pointed out that in order to victoriously complete this year's national budget tasks, in the coming months, it is still necessary to continue to implement the increase production and practice economy, strive to organize revenue, and economize on expenditures, so that this year's national budget will have more revenue than expenditure and a slight surplus.

The conference made appropriate arrangements for the local budget targets for 1958. Vice Premier Li Xiannian instructed the guiding principles for arranging the 1958 budget at the conference. He said: The 1958 budget must be based on the central government's instructed policy of taking the development of heavy industry as the center, developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously, and the basic principles of the Second Five-Year Plan. At present, the development of agricultural production in our country lags behind the needs of the entire national economic development. In order to solve this contradiction, in addition to organizing the reclamation of wasteland, it is necessary to build water conservancy projects, prevent drought and flood, develop the production of chemical fertilizers, and also improve agricultural technology according to specific conditions, in order to increase agricultural yield per unit area. The local budget should first arrange the funding needs in these areas. In terms of cultural, educational, and health undertakings, the overall approach should be to consolidate more and develop less, focusing on improving quality. Administrative management expenses should be further reduced, and all non-productive expenditures should be strictly controlled.

Li Xiannian pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to continue to implement the spirit of increase production and practice economy, adhere to the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, running enterprises through diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings through diligence and thrift, and to launch the increase production and practice economy movement in a comprehensive, in-depth, and sustained manner.

Li Xiannian said that when arranging the 1958 budget, attention should be paid to the principle of looking ahead and behind, and making overall arrangements. So that localities can adapt to local conditions under the centralized and unified leadership of the central government. It is necessary to ensure key construction projects and to give play to local initiative. The arrangement of the budget should be both proactive and prudent and reliable. At the same time, attention should also be paid to these aspects of balance in the arrangement of the budget, namely: budget revenue and expenditure balance, credit revenue and expenditure balance, material supply and demand balance, social purchasing power and necessities balance, and production materials and consumer goods balance.

    财政部召开全国厅局长会议
    今年前八个月国家预算收多于支
    李先念副总理指示要继续开展增产节约运动坚持勤俭建国方针
    本报讯　最近闭幕的全国各省、自治区、直辖市财政厅局长会议满意地指出，今年头八个月国家预算执行情况基本上是良好的。
    这次会议是财政部在9月3日到29日召开的。会议上检查了1957年国家预算执行情况，安排了1958年地方预算收支指标。
    检查的情况表明，1957年1至8月份国家预算收支执行情况基本上是良好的。原因主要是：第一、1956年社会主义改造的胜利和基本建设的跃进，给1957年建设事业的发展带来了极为有利的条件。第二、今年深入地开展了增产节约运动，工业生产、交通运输和商品流转都超过了原定计划。这是预算收入超过支出的一个重要原因。第三、今年虽然有些地方有程度不同的灾情，但从全国范围看，年景一般是好的。会议指出：为了胜利地完成今年的国家预算任务，在今后的几个月内，还必须继续贯彻执行增产节约，努力组织收入，节约支出，以便使今年的国家预算收多于支并且略有结余。
    会议对于1958年地方预算指标作了适当的安排。李先念副总理在会议上指示了安排1958年预算的方针。他说：1958年预算必须根据中央指示的以发展重工业为中心，发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针和第二个五年计划的基本原则。目前，我国农业生产的发展落后于整个国民经济发展的需要，为了解决这个矛盾，除了有组织地开垦荒地以外，必须兴修水利、防旱防涝，发展化学肥料的生产，还要根据具体情况改良农业技术，以便提高农业单位面积产量。地方预算应当首先安排这些方面的资金需要。在文教卫生事业方面总的应该采取多巩固少发展，着重提高质量的方针。行政管理费用要进一步节减，严格控制一切非生产性的开支。
    李先念指出，今后必须继续贯彻增产节约的精神，坚持勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的方针，全面地、深入地、持久地开展增产节约运动。
    李先念说，安排1958年预算的时候，要注意瞻前顾后，统筹安排的原则。使地方在中央的集中统一领导下，能因地制宜。既要保证重点建设，又要发挥地方积极性。预算的安排既要积极，又要稳妥可靠。同时在预算的安排上还要注意这几方面的平衡，即：预算收支平衡、信贷收支平衡、物资供求平衡、社会购买力和生活必需品平衡，以及生产资料和消费资料平衡。
