Xinhua News Agency, October 13th: TASS reports: The Soviet artificial satellite and its carrier rocket are continuing to orbit the Earth. By 6:00 PM (Moscow time) on the 12th, the satellite had completed 115 orbits around the Earth, traveling over 5 million kilometers. Observation and research results, consistent with calculations, show that the time required for the satellite to orbit the Earth is continuing to decrease, reaching 95 minutes and 57 seconds on the 12th. Due to the different degrees of resistance encountered by the satellite and the carrier rocket in the atmosphere, their speed changes are also different. The carrier rocket caught up with the satellite on the 10th, overtook it on the 11th, leading by about two minutes, or approximately 1,000 kilometers, and by the 12th, it was leading by about three minutes, approximately 1,500 kilometers.

Xinhua News Agency, October 13th: TASS reports: The artificial satellite has been clearly seen repeatedly in many places in the Soviet Union, including Moscow, Leningrad, and Vilnius.

Muscovites saw the artificial satellite for the first time at 5:16 AM on the 11th. Early in the morning, many Moscow residents gathered at the Planetarium, which had prepared a large number of optical instruments for observation. However, these instruments were not needed because the satellite was a bright little star, clearly visible to the naked eye. It appeared from the northwest, traversing the sky for four minutes and forty-one seconds. This means that observers could see the satellite travel over 2,000 kilometers in the sky with the naked eye during this time.

Astronomers at the Pulkovo Observatory in Leningrad saw the artificial satellite three times. They successfully determined a series of precise data regarding the satellite and the times of its passage, discovered changes in the satellite's brilliance, and used a double astrograph to photograph the satellite. On the negative, among many stars, the traces of the carrier rocket and the satellite are clearly imprinted.

On the morning of the 11th, staff at the Astronomical Observatory of Vilnius State University saw the satellite twice, at 5:15 AM and 6:53 AM. Both times it traveled from northwest to southeast, passing across the sky in about two minutes. It was clearly visible to the naked eye. At the same time as the satellite was seen, the Vilnius Radio Club also received the satellite's radio signals. They have received forty-eight signals since the satellite was launched. Residents of Kharkov, Alapayevsk, Barnaul, and many other cities in the Soviet Union with favorable climatic conditions for naked-eye observation also saw the artificial satellite that day.

　　人造卫星入镜头
    运载卫星的火箭赶到前面去了
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联人造卫星和运载火箭正在继续环绕地球运行。到12日十八时（莫斯科时间）为止，卫星已经环绕地球转了一百一十五圈，飞过了五百多万公里。观测和研究结果与计算表明，卫星环绕地球一周所需的时间正在继续减低，12日达到九十五分五十七秒。由于卫星和运载火箭在大气层中受到的阻力程度不同，它们的速度变化也有所不同。运载火箭在10日追上了卫星，11日越过了卫星，领先了约两分钟的路程，也就是大约一千公里，12日领先约三分钟的路程，大约一千五百公里。
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联莫斯科、列宁格勒、维尔纽斯等许多地方都一再清楚地看到了人造卫星。
    11日清晨五点十六分，莫斯科人第一次看到了人造卫星。一清早，莫斯科许多居民聚集到天文馆里，天文馆为了观测准备了大量光学仪器。然而这些仪器都未利用上，因为卫星是一颗明亮的小星，肉眼就可以看得很清楚。它从西北方向出现，掠过天空的时间是四分四十一秒。这就是说，观测者肉眼可以看到卫星在这个时间在天空中走过两千多公里的路程。
    列宁格勒普尔科沃天文台的天文学家们三次看到了人造卫星。他们成功地确定了有关卫星的一系列精确的材料和通过的时刻，发现了卫星光辉的变化，并且利用双重天体照相仪摄得了卫星的照片。在底片上，在许多的星星当中，清晰地印下了运载火箭和卫星的痕迹。
    11日清晨国立维尔纽斯大学天文台工作人员在五点十五分和六点五十三分两次看到了卫星。两次都是从西北到东南，在天空经过的时间差不多有两分钟。肉眼都可以清清楚楚地看到。在看到卫星的同时，维尔纽斯无线电俱乐部也收到了卫星的无线电讯号。从卫星发射以来，他们已经收到了四十八次讯号。这一天看到人造卫星的还有哈尔科夫、阿拉帕耶夫斯克、巴尔瑙尔和苏联其他许多气候条件利于肉眼观测的城市的居民。
