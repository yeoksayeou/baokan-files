Unified Purchase Benefits the Majority; Free Trade Enriches a Few
Farmers of Longbang First Cooperative in Duruan Township, Xinhui County, Guangdong, Debate and Win Against Prosperous Middle Peasants

    (Reported by this newspaper) On the evening of October 8th, farmers of Longbang First Cooperative in Duruan Township, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, engaged in a heated debate with prosperous middle peasants. The theme of the debate was: Is it better for the state to uniformly purchase red tobacco, or is free trade better?

    Rich Middle Peasants Forget Personal Enrichment
    Advocate Restoring Free Market for Red Tobacco

    The income from the winter tobacco crop accounts for 36% of the cooperative's total net income each year. During the Great Blooming and Contending period, some prosperous middle peasants suggested that the state should not uniformly purchase red tobacco, but should restore capitalist free trade. For example, prosperous middle peasant Huang Juncheng said, "To improve the lives of farmers, the most important thing is to increase the price of red tobacco and restore free trade. This way, three fen of land can bring wealth." Prosperous middle peasant Huang Muqin echoed his opinion, "The government is carrying out collectivization in order to uniformly purchase farmers' materials. Agricultural cooperatives have to sign contracts with state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives for everything, and suffer under the state price." Some people also took out the quotations from private merchants who purchased red tobacco in the past to compare with the current purchase price: in the past, one dan of tobacco could be exchanged for ten dan of rice, but now it can only be exchanged for five dan. Therefore, they eloquently said: The reason why farmers' lives are not good is mainly because the government "exploited the farmers," and the only way out is for farmers to set the prices of agricultural products.

    Even at the debate, Huang Juncheng eloquently praised the benefits of the free market. He said, "Hey, everyone has heard my opinion before. If farmers could sell red tobacco freely as before, I guarantee they would get rich. In 1949, I sold it for one hundred and sixty yuan per piece (each piece is one hundred catties). Let's talk about something more recent, in 1952 each piece of red tobacco was worth more than seventy yuan. When we are not happy, we can wait for a higher price before selling, the price is in our hands. Hmph, once the unified purchase came, the price dropped, red tobacco is worthless, it is the People's Government that has impoverished the farmers."

    Private Merchants Manipulate the Market, Tobacco Prices Fluctuate, Causing the Majority to Suffer and a Few to Benefit
    These opinions of the prosperous middle peasants aroused unanimous opposition from the farmers, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants. Poor peasant Huang Bocan stood up and refuted him: "In the past, when there was a market but no price, we poor families were forced to sell young tobacco leaves to merchants. If we didn't have money to buy fertilizer, how could we grow tobacco? If we borrowed one dan of sesame bran from the tobacco merchants, we had to repay one and a half dan, and it was stipulated that the tobacco harvested in the future must be sold to them, and they would set the price. This is even worse than selling rice flowers. Rice flowers can be priced after inspection, but the price of tobacco is fixed before it is even planted. Is this considered pricing by the farmers?"

    Ye Caibang, a cadre who used to be in charge of purchasing red tobacco at the supply and marketing cooperative, said: "I am very familiar with the ways of buying and selling red tobacco. In the past, whenever the tobacco picking season approached, tobacco merchants would first go around the tobacco fields to see the growth of each household's tobacco leaves. When the market was selling well and the tobacco leaf production was not high, they would deliberately pretend to be generous and order from the tobacco farmers with good harvests, and even pay in advance; if the market was not selling well and there was overproduction, they would be picky and lower the price. Does everyone think this is pricing by the farmers?"

    Huang Juncheng didn't say a word at this time.

    Ye Caibang asked him: "You said that the price of upper-grade tobacco sometimes reached more than one hundred yuan per piece, I ask you, has it ever fallen to forty yuan per piece?"

    Huang Juncheng replied: "That's not certain. The free market has big ups and downs, but the supply and marketing cooperatives limit us to death!"

    At this time, Huang Yuanhe retorted: "During the period of the capitalist free market, those who benefited were the wealthy households with capital. Your family has a thick foundation and enough rations. After picking the tobacco leaves, you hoard them for a year or two and wait for a good price before selling them. Tobacco merchants have to curry favor with you when the market is thirsty and pay high prices for your tobacco. They ignore the poor people, because they know that if the poor families pick the tobacco and don't sell it quickly, they will starve. When the poor people beg them to buy tobacco, they either pick on your tobacco or say that the market is not good and they can't buy much, forcing you to sell it cheaply."

    Poor peasant Huang Bocan couldn't help but speak again. He said to Huang Juncheng: "I don't have such good skills as you wealthy households. One year, I borrowed six hundred Hong Kong dollars from a merchant and was forced to write a receipt mortgaging all my family property, including farm tools, houses, and real estate, hoping to sell tobacco to repay the debt. As soon as the tobacco merchant arrived in the village, I followed behind him asking him to buy it. What did he say? 'Your tobacco is of second-rate quality!' I patiently explained how old and beautiful my tobacco was, but he ridiculed me and said, 'An eighteen-year-old girl is not considered old, a handsome boy is even more beautiful than you.' I will remember this for the rest of my life. But in order to repay the debt, I had no choice but to sell it cheaply, one dan of tobacco was only worth one hundred and thirty catties of rice, who is like you who can exchange it for more than ten dans of rice and make a fortune. All my tobacco money was not enough to repay the debt, I had to sell the best five fen of land. We don't need such freedom of trade!"

    Huang Yuanhe said: "The free market is only good for those who have the capital to hoard tobacco, they can make a lot of money to buy land. We can count how many households bought land in the past. In Heshanli, only you, Huang Juncheng, bought land." At the meeting, the commune members counted from village to village, lane to lane. Out of the 248 households in the whole village, only eight households could be considered rich.

    Unified Purchase Limits Speculative Trading
    But Guarantees the Normal Income of Tobacco Farmers

    At this time, some individual commune members agreed with Huang Juncheng that the supply and marketing cooperative was doing a monopoly business and "exploiting the farmers." In order to refute them, Ye Caibang presented the truth about the supply and marketing cooperative purchasing tobacco leaves from farmers. In 1952, farmers produced a large amount of red tobacco. At that time, the market sales were limited. The tobacco merchants initially lowered the purchase price. Later, seeing that the situation was not right, they simply turned around and stopped buying it. Farmers could not use tobacco as food and complained everywhere. In order to prevent farmers from suffering losses, the government still posted a price according to the general market price and bought all the red tobacco. At that time, the ancestral halls in Yangjiang Village and Pengluo Village in Duruan Township were filled with red tobacco, which everyone witnessed. Ye Caibang said: "I slept with red tobacco for almost a year. It was not until the Jiangmen City Materials Exchange Conference in 1953 that the government tried everything possible to open up sales channels and sell the accumulated red tobacco, some of which were even sold at a loss. How can you say that the state's unified purchase limits the farmers! In my opinion, the unified purchase of red tobacco limits those who engage in speculative trading, guarantees the normal income of the vast number of tobacco farmers, and prevents price fluctuations and losses for poor peasants."

    After this ideological exchange, the so-called restoration of capitalist free trade and refusal to obey the state's market management advocated by the prosperous middle peasants lost their market among the poor and lower-middle peasants. Huang Juncheng and others also no longer insisted on canceling the unified purchase policy.

    统一收购多数人沾光　自由买卖少数人发财
    广东新会县杜阮乡龙榜一社农民辩赢了富裕中农
    本报讯　10月8日的晚上，广东省新会县杜阮乡龙榜第一社的农民，和富裕中农展开了一场热烈的辩论。辩论的主题是：红烟由国家统一收购好？还是自由买卖好？
      富裕中农不忘个人发财
      主张恢复红烟自由市场
    这个社每年冬种的烟，纯收入占该社纯收入总数的36％。在大鸣大放时，有些富裕中农提出红烟不应该由国家统一收购，要恢复资本主义的自由买卖。如富裕中农黄均成说：“要改善农民生活，最重要的是提高红烟价格，恢复自由买卖，这样嘛，三分田就可以发财。”富裕中农黄慕勤附和他的意见：“政府搞合作化，就是为了统购农民的物资。农业社样样都要和国营公司、供销社订合同，受国家牌价的气。”有些人还拿过去私商收购红烟的行情单，来对比现在的收购价：过去一担烟换得十担谷，现在只换得五担。于是，他们即振振有词地说：农民生活不好的原因主要是政府“剥削了农民”，唯一的出路就是农产品要由农民定价。
    甚至在辩论会上，黄均成还滔滔不绝称赞自由市场的好处。他说：“嘿，我的意见大家早就听过啦。如果农民像从前一样自由卖红烟，保证发财。1949年我就卖过一百六十元一件（每件一百斤）。说近事吧，1952年每件红烟还值七十多元。我们不高兴时还可以等高价才卖出，价钱掌握在我们的手里。哼，统一收购一来，价格下跌了，红烟不值钱了，是人民政府害穷了农民。”
    私商操纵市场烟价起落不一使得多数人吃亏少数人沾光
    富裕中农的这些意见，引起了农民特别是贫农和下中农的一致反对。贫农黄柏灿站起来驳他：“过去有市无价的时候，我们穷人家迫得卖烟青给商家佬。没有钱买肥料怎样种烟呀，向烟商借一担麻麸，要还一担半，而且订明将来收的烟一定要卖给他们，由他们定价。这样比卖禾花还惨，禾花还能看看才定价，而烟还未种下，价就定死了。这算做农民定价吗？”
    曾经在供销社担任过收购红烟的干部叶彩邦说：“买卖红烟的行路我可熟悉。从前，每逢接近摘烟季节，烟商首先走遍烟地，看清楚各户烟叶的生长情况。碰到市场有销路，烟叶产量不多的时候，他们就故意装作大方，到收成好的烟农家里订购，还预先付款；如果碰到市场销路不大，生产过剩，他就左挑右拣，压低价钱。大家说这算不算是由农民定价？”
    黄均成这时吭都没有吭一声。
    叶彩邦问他：“你说上烟价格有时高至一百多元一件，我反问一下，有没有跌到四十元一件的呢？”
    黄均成答道：“这就说不定了。自由市场有大起有大跌，而供销社却限死我们呢！”
    这时，黄元贺反驳说：“在资本主义自由市场的时期，沾光的都是有本钱的大户人家。你们家底厚，口粮足，摘了烟叶，囤它一两年，等到好价才吊起来卖。烟商在渴市时就不得不巴结你们，出高价买你们的烟。对穷人就不睬不理了，因为他们知道，穷人家摘了烟不赶快卖出去，就要饿肚皮。穷人恳求他们买烟的时候，他们不是对你的烟挑挑剔剔，就说什么市情不好，不能多收购了，迫得你只好贱价卖出。”
    贫农黄柏灿忍不住又发言了。他对黄均成说：“我没有你们大户这样好本领。有一年，我借了商家佬六百元港币，迫着写下以农具、屋宇、物业等全部家产做抵押的借据，指望卖烟还债。烟商一上村，我就跟在后面要求收购。他怎样说呢？‘你的烟是二仔底！’我耐心介绍我的烟种得怎样又老又靓，他却奚落我说：‘十八岁姑娘未算老，靓仔比你还靓。’我一生都记得这件事。但为了要还债，迫于无奈，夹平夹贱卖给他，一担烟只值得一百三十斤谷，谁个像你换得十多担谷那样好财气。我全部烟钱都不够还债，只有卖掉最好的五分田。我们不需要这样的买卖自由！”
    黄元贺说：“自由市场就是对有本钱囤烟的人有好处，他们可以赚大钱买田。我们可以数一数，过去买田的有多少户，鹤山里只不过你黄均成一户。”会场上，社员们逐里逐巷来数，数来数去全村二百四十八户人家，所谓能算得上发了财的不过是八户。
    统购限死了投机买卖的人
    却保障了烟农的正常收入
    这时，还有个别社员同意黄均成所说的供销社做独市生意，“剥削了农民”。叶彩邦为了辩倒他们，摆出供销社收购农民的烟叶的真相。1952年农民大量生产红烟，当时市场销路有限，烟商起初压价收购，后来看见势头不对，索性掉头不来收购了。农民不能把烟当粮食，到处叫苦。政府为了不使农民吃亏，依然按照市场一般价格挂出牌价，把红烟全部收下来。当时杜阮乡阳江村、彭洛村两处的祠堂，都堆满了红烟，这是大家有目共睹的。叶彩邦说：“我和红烟一同睡觉差不多有一年了，直到1953年江门市开物资交流大会，政府想尽一切办法打开销路，才把积存的红烟卖了出去，有的还亏了本。怎能说国家统一收购是限死了农民！依我看，统一收购红烟是限死了做投机买卖的人，保障了广大烟农的正常收入，不致价格起跌无常，贫农吃亏。”
    经过这一场思想交锋，富裕中农提出的所谓恢复资本主义的自由买卖，不服从国家的市场管理的言论，在贫农和下中农中间失去了市场。黄均成等人也再不坚持取消统一收购的论调了。
