	I think here, how much our people love the Soviet Union! Although this is said so simply, the fact is absolutely true. If you don't believe it, go ask anyone who has been to the Soviet Union. After they come back, no matter where they go, whoever they meet, they will say: Haven't you been to the Soviet Union? Tell us about the Soviet Union. Even if you went to the Soviet Union a long time ago, even after several years, people still want to ask: You have been to the Soviet Union, tell us what you saw. Those who have been there also tirelessly talk about their feelings again and again. Why is this? We know that people always cherish and remember their favorite people or things, and they will always unconsciously bring them up repeatedly.

	Also, the Soviet experts or writers, those who haven't met them, once they know you have met them, they will definitely come and ask, for example: How witty is Korneichuk? What does the author of "The Rainbow," Vasilevskaya, look like? How solemn is Zoya's mother? How full of youthful vitality is Surkov? Not to mention the envious eyes you get for having shaken hands twice with the revered Elder Voroshilov.

	Take myself as an example, I will never forget the Soviet expert Maria, although I know very little about her, and the meeting was only for a moment. I first heard about her in Xi'an in mid-May, and I met her in Xi'an at the end of May. This was more than four months ago, but her image is always in my mind. Every time I hear the phrase "the selfless help of the Soviet people to us," I especially think of her.

	In mid-May this year, I visited a power plant in Xi'an, which is fully automated. Walking into the plant, I couldn't hear that rumbling sound. Walking into the workshop, each room was so "spotless." The workers quietly walked back and forth, looking at the meters, and sometimes moving the machinery. This was the first time I had seen such a fully automated plant, and I was very interested. The plant director introduced the construction process, saying: "The construction of this plant was mainly helped by Soviet experts. Especially the first phase of the project was completely designed by Soviet experts. The first phase of the project started during the freezing period. We had no experience in this, so the construction process was guided by Soviet experts. At most, there were more than twenty experts to guide us. For the second phase of the project, because we learned from the Soviet experience, we can do it ourselves. The machinery and equipment here are all from the Soviet Union. At first, we couldn't master them, because in the past we used British and American machines, which had to be operated manually and were poorly protected. Soviet machines are mostly automatic. Even coal adding is done by machines, which grind the coal into fine powder and spray it into the furnace through pipes. In the past, manual coal adding often caused accidents, either the fire stopped or the coal exploded in the furnace, which was neither economical nor safe. In order to learn how to master this furnace, the Soviet expert Maria helped us for more than four months. She went into the furnace chamber and the flue every day. When she came out, she was covered in gray from head to toe. The workers called this old lady expert 'White-Haired Girl.'"

	"The old lady often gave lectures to the workers," the plant director continued with interest, "Sometimes she lectured for more than forty days in a row. The workers wrote down the lectures and experimental methods of the old lady, and posted them on the head of their beds to look at them often. Some people memorized them. At first, they learned mechanically, and after several experiments, they could master it and become proficient. So, during the second trial run, they were able to master it in just twenty-four hours, and the smoke coming out of the furnace was white. This is what Maria taught with great care."

	After hearing this story, I often imagined this dusty "White-Haired Girl" old expert in my mind. At the end of May, I returned to Xi'an from Lanzhou. In the Xi'an People's Building, I met a young woman who worked in that power plant. We were talking when we suddenly saw an old Soviet lady in her fifties, not very tall, thin, with a head full of gray hair, walking down the stairs. The young woman immediately ran over to speak to her kindly, and then turned back to introduce her to us, saying: This is Maria, a Soviet expert from our factory. When I heard that it was Maria, I couldn't help but call out in joy, and held her hands with both hands. The translation comrade told her what I knew about her, and she smiled, looking a little embarrassed. Then she told us that she was going to the station to pick up her son, who was coming from Moscow because she couldn't go back herself, so her son was taking advantage of the summer vacation to see her.

	I know so little about Maria, and the meeting was less than ten minutes, but I can't forget her, she has a radiance in my heart. I often tell this little story to people, and now I write it down. On the occasion of celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, I would like to send out a little spark of gratitude.

专栏：节日的怀念

    马丽亚

    我在这里想，我们人民是多么热爱苏联啊！话虽说得这样简单，事实却千真万确。不信，你去问问，凡是到过苏联的人，他们回来以后，不管走到那里，随便遇到谁，都要说：你不是到过苏联吗？讲讲苏联的事给我们听。即使你是很久以前去过苏联的，事隔好几年了，还是有人要问：你到过苏联，把你看见的讲给我们听听吧。去过的人也不惮其烦的，一遍又一遍的讲他的感受。这是为什么？我们知道，人们总是对自己最喜爱的人或事，时时缅怀，时时叨念，时时会不自觉的反复提起。
    还有，就是从苏联来的专家，或者作家，没有见到他们的人，一旦知道你见到了，一定要跑来问，例如：柯涅楚克是怎样有风趣？“虹”的作者瓦西列夫斯卡娅是什么样子？卓娅的妈妈是怎样庄严？苏尔科夫是怎样充满了青春的活力？更不用说为了你曾和万人景仰的伏罗希洛夫老人握过两次手，而对你显露羡慕的眼光了。
    拿我自己来说吧，我就永远忘不了苏联专家马丽亚，虽然我知道她的事很少，见面也只有一刹那的时间。我是5月中旬先在西安听到她的事，5月末在西安遇到她，这已是四个多月以前的事了，可是，她的影子时刻在我脑子里。每回听到“苏联人民对我们无私的帮助”这句话的时候，我就特别想到她。
    今年5月中旬，我在西安参观一个发电厂，这厂全部自动化。走进厂，听不到那样轰隆隆的声音，走到车间，每间都是那样“室无纤尘”。工人们静静地来回走着，看看表，有时拨动拨动机关。这是我第一次看见这样完全自动化的厂，非常有兴趣。厂长介绍建厂过程，说：“建设这厂，主要是苏联专家帮助的。尤其是第一期工程，完全是苏联专家帮我们设计。第一期工程是在冻期开工，我们没有这经验，所以施工过程都是苏联专家指导，最多的时候有二十几位专家来指导。第二期工程，由于我们学习了苏联经验，就能自己搞了。这里机器设备都是从苏联来的，开始我们掌握不了，因为过去用的是英国、美国的机器，要用人手开动，保护差。苏联机器多是自动，加煤也不用人，由机器把煤碾成细粉从管子里喷到炉子里去。过去用人手加煤，常常发生事故，不是停火了就是煤在炉里爆炸，既不经济又不保险。为了学习掌握这炉子，苏联专家马丽亚帮助咱四个多月，她天天钻到炉膛子里，烟道中，走出来，从头到脚一身灰，工人都把这位老太太专家叫‘白毛女’。”
    “老太太常给工人讲课，”厂长继续有兴趣地说：“有时一连讲了四十多天，工人们把老太太讲的课和做的试验方法，写好，贴在床头上常常看。有的人把它背熟。开始是机械地学，再经过几次试验就能掌握，而且熟练了，所以第二次试炉的时候，只经过二十四小时就能掌握，炉烟出来就是白色了。这是马丽亚精心教导出来的。”
    我听了这故事以后，脑中常常幻想这一身灰尘的“白毛女”老专家。5月末，我从兰州又回到西安，在西安人民大厦里，遇到一位女青年，她就在那个发电厂工作。我们正在谈着，忽见从楼梯上走下来一位五十多岁，身材不太高，清瘦而有满头灰白头发的苏联老太太，这位女青年立刻跑去和她亲切的说话，又回过头来给我们介绍，说：这是我们厂里苏联专家马丽亚。我一听说是马丽亚，不觉欢喜得叫起来，双手捧着她的手。翻译同志把我知道她的事讲给她听，她也笑了，有些不好意思的样子。随即告诉我们说：她就要到车站去接她的儿子，他是从莫斯科来的，因为她自己不能回去，所以她儿子就趁暑假来看她。
    我知道马丽亚的事是这样少，见面也不到十分钟，可我就忘不了她，她在我心里有了光辉。我常常对人讲这段小故事，现在又把它写下来，在庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候我愿意发出一点点感谢的火花。
