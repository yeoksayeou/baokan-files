Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 3rd October: The Fourth Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) is due to open in Leipzig on October 4th. In recent days, trade union representatives from various countries have been arriving in Leipzig one after another. Leipzig welcomes more than a hundred guests from all over the world every day. The Soviet trade union delegation, headed by Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, and the Chinese trade union delegation, headed by Liu Changsheng, recently arrived in Leipzig.

The President of the WFTU, Vittorio, the Vice Presidents, and the staff of the WFTU headquarters, headed by Secretary-General Saillant, have also arrived.

In a talk published in "Neues Deutschland" on October 2nd, WFTU President Vittorio pointed out the significance of this conference, saying: "The Leipzig Congress will be the largest and most democratic World Trade Union conference," and it "will promote the unity of the working class and take a decisive step in the process of forming a unified trade union organization."

Vittorio said: Workers and the public in various countries are watching the Fourth World Trade Union Congress. The central issue of this congress is to discuss the urgent problems of the working class in the current situation - to continuously expand the unity of workers with different worldviews, and finally to establish unified trade union organizations not only in each country but also internationally. He said that representatives of every trade union, whether independent or belonging to other international organizations, have been invited to attend this congress, and many independent trade union organizations, such as those in Japan and Yugoslavia, have accepted the invitation to participate in this congress and freely exchange opinions.

Vittorio said, "I believe that the results of this congress will meet the expectations of workers in various countries, and this result will promote the unity of the working class and take a decisive step in the process of forming a unified trade union organization, and will give impetus and encouragement to the working class who are struggling to improve their living standards and material conditions, and who are fighting against the endless exploitation and oppression of industrial and agricultural monopoly capitalists."

Speaking of the necessity of cooperation between trade unions of various countries, Vittorio said, "In my opinion, it is absolutely necessary and possible to establish harmonious relations between trade unions in the capitalist world and within the international trade union itself, in order to mobilize the struggle of the broad masses and constantly lead this struggle towards unity, strength, and victory." Vittorio spoke about the situation of the working class in capitalist countries today and the attack of monopoly capital on the working class, and pointed out the necessity and urgency of conducting a joint struggle. He said that only in this way can the interests of the working class be effectively protected, and only in this way can the broad masses of working people be mobilized to carry out a resolute struggle against the monopoly capitalists.

Approximately one thousand representatives from more than one hundred countries around the world will participate in the Fourth World Trade Union Congress.

    加强友好合作  促进团结统一
    世界工会代表大会今日开幕
    维多里奥说：这是一次最大的和最民主的世界工会会议
    新华社柏林3日电  世界工会联合会第四次代表大会10月4日就要在来比锡开幕了。这几天来，世界各国的工会代表陆续到达了来比锡，来比锡每天要迎接一百多位来自世界各地的客人。以全苏工会中央理事会主席格里辛为首的苏联工会代表团和以刘长胜为首的中国工会代表团在最近先后到达来比锡。
    世界工联主席维多里奥和各位副主席以及以总书记赛扬为首的世界工联总部的工作人员也已经先后到达。
    世界工联主席维多里奥在10月2日“新德意志报”上发表谈话指出这次大会的意义说：“来比锡大会将是一次最大的和最民主的世界工会会议”，它“将促使工人阶级团结和在组成一个统一的工会组织的过程中迈进决定性的一步”。
    维多里奥说：世界各国工人和公众都在注视着第四次世界工会大会。这次大会的中心问题是讨论工人阶级在目前形势下的紧迫问题——不断地扩大世界上具有不同世界观的工人的团结，最后不仅仅在各国国内、而且要在国际上建立起统一的工会组织。他说，不管是独立的或者属于其它国际组织的每一个工会的代表，都被邀出席这次大会，很多独立的工会组织，例如日本和南斯拉夫都接受了参加这次大会和自由交换意见的邀请。
    维多里奥说，我相信本届大会的结果将符合于各国工人对它的期望，这种结果将促使工人阶级团结和在组成一个统一的工会组织的过程中迈进决定性的一步，并且将对正在为提高生活水平、改善物质状况而斗争以及为反对工业和农业垄断资本家的无止境的剥削和压榨而斗争的工人阶级给以动力和鼓舞。
    在谈到各国工会间合作的必要时，维多里奥说，按照我的意见，在资本主义世界的工会之间和国际工会本身之间为了动员广大群众的斗争和将这一斗争不断地引向统一、有力和取得胜利，建立和睦关系是十分必需的，也是可能的。维多里奥谈到了今天资本主义各国工人阶级的处境和垄断资本对工人阶级的进攻，并且指出进行联合斗争的必要性和迫切性。他说，只有这样，工人阶级的利益才能有力地被保护住，只有这样，才能动员广大劳苦大众为反对垄断资本家而进行坚决的斗争。
    世界工会第四次代表大会将有一千名左右代表参加，他们来自世界的一百多个国家。
