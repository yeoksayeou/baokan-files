Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th -- Indian Prime Minister Nehru told reporters from Japanese newspapers in Hakone today that peace cannot be maintained by organizing military blocs.

Nehru said that the future of peace is not so bright, but there are signs of progress. The important thing is that more and more people in the world hate the outbreak of war.

Nehru said that the world's scientific development is too fast, and political thought has not kept up. He said that the world has entered the era of intercontinental missiles and artificial satellites. He strongly advocated preventing the occurrence of atomic warfare.

Nehru said that if one country tries to force another country to accept its system, it will cause war. He said that coexistence means that one country should not interfere in the affairs of another country. Every country should seek its own path of development. Interference is the root of disputes.

Nehru said that China is a large country, and no one can say that China is not an independent country. All countries are gradually tending to recognize China.

    尼赫鲁斥军事集团政策  强调不能干涉他国内政
    并说所有国家逐渐趋向承认中国
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：印度总理尼赫鲁今天在箱根对日本报纸的记者说，不能够用组织军事集团的方法来保持和平。
    尼赫鲁说，和平的前途不是那么光明，但是，已经有了进展的征象。重要的是世界人民越来越多地憎恨战争爆发这个事实。
    尼赫鲁说，世界的科学发展太快了，政治思想没有赶上。他说，世界已经进入了洲际导弹和人造卫星的时代。他极力主张防止发生原子战争。
    尼赫鲁说，如果一个国家企图强迫另一个国家接受它的制度，这就会引起战争。他说，共处的意思是：一个国家不应该干涉另一个国家的事务。每一个国家都应该寻求自己的发展的道路。干涉是纷争的根源。
    尼赫鲁说，中国是一个大国，任何人都不能说中国不是一个独立国。所有国家都逐渐趋向于承认中国。
