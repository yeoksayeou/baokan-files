    Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Ganlei Township
    Sells More Surplus Grain Than Planned, Exceeding Original Plan by 100%
    (Our report) After a socialist great debate in Ganlei Township, Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, the socialist consciousness of the peasants has been greatly enhanced, and the ideas of patriotism and love for the commune have been further improved, and a production upsurge has begun to appear.
    The original plan for the nine agricultural cooperatives in the township, under the domination of localism, was to sell less than 600,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Now, after careful calculation by the cooperative cadres and the masses, it is estimated that more than 1.2 million jin of surplus grain can be sold to the state. The commune members' actions of loving the commune have also become widespread. The feeders of Ganlei First and Second Cooperatives were originally careless in feeding livestock, and although they fed a lot of fodder, the livestock were not strong. Now, they consciously get up early to let the livestock eat grass, and when it's time to work in the fields, they feed them well. In the afternoon, when the livestock return from labor, they let them graze until dark before bringing them back. The phenomenon that many commune members only cared about earning work points and did not cherish the livestock has disappeared. The Fifth Production Team of Taojiazai Cooperative found that the livestock's neckbands were broken, and the commune members automatically repaired twelve of them. Cai Guoman used his own leather to repair four of them.

    互助土族自治县甘雷乡
    出售余粮超过原计划一倍
    本报讯　青海省互助土族自治县甘雷乡经过社会主义大辩论后，大大提高了农民的社会主义觉悟，爱国、爱社的思想进一步提高，开始出现了生产高潮。
    全乡九个农业社，原先在本位主义思想支配下，计划卖给国家的余粮不到六十万斤。现在经过社干部和群众精打细算预计可卖给国家余粮一百二十多万斤。社员爱社的行动，也普遍出现了。甘雷一、二社的饲养员原先喂牲口不经心，料喂得多，牲口还不壮。现在，他们自觉的早起放牲口去吃青草，到下地时，就喂得饱饱的了。下午牲口劳动回来，他们又放到天黑才赶回来。许多社员原只为多挣工分，不爱惜牲口的现象已经没有了。陶家寨社五生产队发现牲口围脖坏了，社员自动修补了十二个。蔡国满用自己的皮子就修补了四个。
