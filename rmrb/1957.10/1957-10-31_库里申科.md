Ode to October

    Kulichenko
    Fang Jing
    This great river flows through my hometown,
    Right here, Kulichenko heroically sacrificed himself,
    To praise this eternal and immortal life,
    The river sings day and night of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    This great river flows through my hometown,
    Supporting the righteous action of resisting Japan,
    He volunteered to fly far to the Chinese sky,
    The river sings day and night of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    This great river flows through my hometown,
    His agile eagles swirl in the clouds,
    Heroically defending the Chinese sky,
    The river sings day and night of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    This great river flows through my hometown,
    He flashed across the sky like lightning,
    He sounded in the river like thunder,
    The river sings day and night of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    This great river flows through my hometown,
    The river devoutly offers the wreath whirled up here
    to Kulichenko,
    The river sings day and night of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    This great river flows through my hometown,
    The lush pines and cypresses on the mountains on both banks
    stand solemnly in silence for his noble soul,
    The river sings day and night of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    This great river flows through my hometown,
    Everyone who passes here lowers their head in awe,
    Solemn love permeates this river,
    The river sings day and night of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    This great river flows through my hometown,
    Gratefully looking up to the sacred fire of the October Revolution,
    Forever remembering Kulichenko who fought for China,
    The river sings day and night of Sino-Soviet friendship.

    库里申科
    方敬这条大江从我家乡流过，就在这里库里申科壮烈牺牲，为了赞颂这永恒不朽的生命，江水日夜唱着中苏友好的歌。这条大江从我家乡流过，支援中国抗日的正义行动，他志愿远远飞到中国天空，江水日夜唱着中苏友好的歌。这条大江从我家乡流过，他矫健的鹰群在云端旋飞，英勇地把中国的天空保卫，江水日夜唱着中苏友好的歌。这条大江从我家乡流过，他像一道闪电掠过天空，他像一声雷鸣响入江中，江水日夜唱着中苏友好的歌。这条大江从我家乡流过，江水把它在这里漩起的花圈虔诚地向库里申科奉献，江水日夜唱着中苏友好的歌。这条大江从我家乡流过，两岸山岩上苍翠的松柏肃立着为他崇高的灵魂静默，江水日夜唱着中苏友好的歌。这条大江从我家乡流过，每个人从这里过都肃然低回，庄严的敬爱浸透这片江水，江水日夜唱着中苏友好的歌。这条大江从我家乡流过，感激地仰望十月革命的圣火，永记着为中国战斗过的库里申科，江水日夜唱着中苏友好的歌。
