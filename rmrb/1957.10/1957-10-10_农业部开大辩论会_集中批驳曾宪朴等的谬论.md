Ministry of Agriculture Holds Major Debate
    Concentrating on Refuting the Fallacies of Zeng Xianpu and Others

    (Our report) The Ministry of Agriculture recently held a major debate with over a thousand participants to clarify some major issues of right and wrong, and thoroughly criticized the fallacies of right-wing elements.

    The conference focused on criticizing Zeng Xianpu, deputy director of the Economic Crops Bureau and agent of Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu in the Ministry of Agriculture, as well as right-wing elements such as Shen Zengkan, Tu Youren, and Guo Shufan. They denied the leadership of the Party, negated the development of China's agriculture and the achievements of the Ministry of Agriculture, slandered agricultural cooperativization and the unified purchase and sale of grain as a "complete mess," and attempted to pull the countryside onto the capitalist road. Many people at the meeting used commonly seen facts to refute the distortions and slanders of the right-wing elements.

    More than forty people spoke at the conference over six days. As a result of these systematic refutations, some right-wing elements felt that they had run out of arguments, admitted that they had been dishonest in the past, and asked to continue confessing their problems; some even expressed their willingness to expose others and perform meritorious service to redeem themselves. Although some right-wing elements were outwardly compliant but inwardly unconvinced, they had nothing to say and could not find any reason to quibble.

    During this major debate, many people were educated. Some said that in the past they lacked due vigilance against right-wing elements, believing that "a few small fish cannot stir up big waves." From the facts revealed at the meeting, they realized that class struggle had not been extinguished, but was still continuing. They stated that in the future they could not only focus on business and not care about politics. Many intellectuals further realized the importance of ideological remolding and stated that they would work hard to transform themselves in the future.

    农业部开大辩论会
    集中批驳曾宪朴等的谬论
    本报讯　农业部为辨明一些大是大非，最近召开了一个有一千多人参加的大辩论会，对右派分子的谬论进行了透彻的批驳。
    大会集中批判了经济作物局副局长，章伯钧、李伯球在农业部的代理人曾宪朴，以及沈曾侃、涂友仁、郭树藩等右派分子。他们否认党的领导，否定我国农业的发展和农业部的工作成就，诬蔑农业合作化和粮食统购统销“一团糟”，企图把农村拉到资本主义道路上去。会上许多人用人所共见的事实驳倒了右派分子的歪曲和诬蔑。
    六天中有四十多人在大会上发言。由于这些系统的驳斥，有些右派分子感到理尽词穷，承认了自己过去不老实，要求继续交代问题；有的人还表示要揭发别人，立功赎罪。有的右派分子虽然口服心不服，但是他们无话可说，找不出任何狡辩的理由。
    在这次大辩论中间，许多人都受到了教育。有的说，过去对右派分子缺乏应有的警惕，认为“几条小鱼翻不起大浪”，从会上揭发的事实中，认识到阶级斗争并没有熄灭，而是仍在继续。他们表示今后不能只钻业务而不过问政治。许多知识分子进一步认识到思想改造的重要性，表示今后要在工作中好好改造自己。
