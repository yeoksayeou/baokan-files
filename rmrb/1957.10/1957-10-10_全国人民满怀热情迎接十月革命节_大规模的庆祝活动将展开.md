Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The provinces and cities across the country are actively preparing for large-scale celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

    The people of Beijing are filled with enthusiasm for the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Beijing Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Beijing organizations of various people's groups are jointly formulating plans for celebration activities. The Beijing Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is preparing to hold a large-scale photo exhibition, displaying two sets of photos introducing Sino-Soviet friendship and the labor and life of the Soviet people. To celebrate this great day, the scientific, cultural, and publishing circles in Beijing have published a large number of books and paintings introducing the achievements of the Soviet revolution and construction and Sino-Soviet friendship, as well as many famous Soviet literary works. The Beijing People's Art Theater has mobilized the entire theater to rehearse the famous play "The Man with a Gun," which reflects the October Revolution, and is preparing to meet the audience during the festival. Actors from the Experimental Drama Theater of the Central Academy of Drama are also rushing to rehearse the famous play "The Storm of Revolution," which depicts senior intellectuals embracing the revolution during the October Revolution. The China Acrobatic Troupe, the Naval Cultural Troupe, and the National Orchestra of the Broadcasting Station are stepping up rehearsals, preparing to go to the Soviet Union soon to participate in the celebration of the October Revolution Day and perform for the Soviet people. Various agencies and universities in Beijing are also actively preparing for celebration activities. The more than 100,000 copies of the "Outline for the Propaganda of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution (1917-1957)," jointly drafted by the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the CPSU, which were sold by Xinhua Bookstore, were sold out in less than three days. Now the Beijing Branch of Xinhua Bookstore is rushing to reprint 70,000 copies.

    In Shanghai, our country's largest city, large-scale celebrations for the October Revolution Day will begin on the 10th. Cities such as Tianjin, Chongqing, and Anshan, as well as the provinces of Liaoning, Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Qinghai, have also jointly decided to celebrate the October Socialist Revolution Day by local CCP organizations, CPPCC organizations, Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branches, and various people's groups. All localities have decided to carry out a month-long Sino-Soviet friendship activity starting around October 10th. Before and after the festival, large-scale celebration meetings and get-togethers will be held in various places, and report meetings and exhibitions will be widely held to promote Sino-Soviet friendship and introduce the great achievements of Soviet construction to workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, members of handicraft cooperatives, and urban residents.

    Our people hold the greatest gratitude for the Soviet experts who have selflessly helped our country carry out socialist construction. During the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee will organize a delegation to visit construction sites in Xi'an, Baoji, and other places to express their gratitude to the Soviet experts. In Anshan, the steel capital, and other units where Soviet experts are helping, there will be general get-togethers and discussions with Soviet experts, and a review of the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions. In the field exploration base in Qinghai Province, staff of some units will also hold get-togethers with Soviet experts.

    This year's commemorative activities are more extensive than in the past. The Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an Municipal branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association are preparing to organize a large-scale lecture group to go deep into the grassroots units in Xi'an and Xianyang, Baoji, Tongguan, and other places to publicize the great significance of the October Socialist Revolution to the general public and farmers. The ceremony for naming the South Suburb Dama Road in Xi'an as Sino-Soviet Friendship Road will be held in early November. More than 1,000 workers and technicians in Anshan who have studied and visited the Soviet Union will widely report to the staff and workers on the Soviet people's diligence and thrift in building the country. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to convene a city-level meeting of reporters and propagandists in the near future to arrange for them to carry out propaganda activities in all regions and departments of the city. Some units in Chongqing that have achieved success in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union will hold seminars, and people who have achieved success in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union will widely report to the masses. Shenyang will also organize more than 100 returned students and interns from the Soviet Union to factories, schools, and rural areas around the October Revolution Day to report on the achievements of Soviet construction. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League is actively preparing to welcome the Soviet Irkutsk Youth Delegation. The Irkutsk youth have established a deep friendship with the Shenyang youth in the past, and they will soon come to Shenyang for a friendly visit.

    Hunan, Hubei, Qinghai, and other places have compiled and printed a large number of books and propaganda posters promoting Sino-Soviet friendship and Soviet construction achievements. The Hunan Provincial Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has distributed 15,000 propaganda posters of "Learning from Soviet Youth to Participate in Agricultural Labor" to various places, and another 160,000 copies of "Learning from the Soviet Union," which are supplied to factories and rural areas as popular propaganda materials, are being printed. The 100,000 copies of propaganda materials compiled and printed by the Qinghai Provincial Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will be distributed to grassroots units such as townships and agricultural cooperatives before the 10th. A photo exhibition focusing on Soviet experts helping Qinghai Province with railway surveying and resource exploration is being actively prepared by relevant units in Xining. The Hubei Provincial Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has collected thousands of photos mainly reflecting the activities of Soviet experts in Wuhan and is compiling them into a book.
