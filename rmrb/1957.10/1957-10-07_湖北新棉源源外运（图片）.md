Hubei's New Cotton is Shipped Out in a Steady Stream
Hubei Province has a bumper cotton harvest. It is estimated that the province's more than 8 million mu of cotton will increase production by 8% compared to last year. Hubei Province is now transferring large quantities of new cotton to Beijing, Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu and other places to support industrial production. (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Liu Xinning)
　　
　　A large number of wooden sailboats parked on the banks of the Han River are already loaded with cotton and are about to set sail.

　　The cotton harvest has delighted the cotton-picking girls. This is Chen Yuzhen, a member of the Communist Youth League from the Qianjin No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liuji Township, Xinzhou County, a cooperative that produces 100 jin of ginned cotton.

    湖北新棉源源外运
    湖北省棉花丰收，全省八百多万亩棉花预计可比去年增产8％。现在湖北省把大批新棉调运北京、上海、安徽、江苏等地支援工业生产。新华社记者　刘心宁摄
    停在汉水边上的大批木帆船，已经装满了棉花，马上就要启运了。
    棉花丰收乐坏了摘棉姑娘。这是百斤皮棉社——新洲县刘集乡前进第一农业生产合作社的共青团员陈玉珍。
