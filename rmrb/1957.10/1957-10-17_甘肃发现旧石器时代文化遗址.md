A Paleolithic cultural site was recently discovered in Shuidonggou Village, Lingwu County, Gansu Province. It contains more than 40 pieces of Paleolithic stone flakes, axe-like tools, and scrapers. One small stone flake was identified by experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences as a "bipolar flake" or "double-edged tool," which is of great help for studying the development of the Paleolithic period in China.

This cultural site is part of the Paleolithic culture of the entire Ordos region, and it was discovered after the discovery of the "Ordos Man" fossil. This provides new data for the study of the history of humans in the Middle Paleolithic period in China. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　甘肃发现旧石器时代文化遗址
    甘肃省灵武县水洞沟村，最近发现一处旧石器时代文化遗址。其中有旧石器石片、斧状器和刮削器共四十多件。有一件小型石片，经中国科学院专家鉴定，认为它是“两极石片”或“两端刃器”，对研究中国旧石器的发展有很大的帮助。
    这一文化遗址是整个河套地带旧石器时代文化的一部分，它是继发现“河套人”骨化石后发现的。这对研究中国旧石器时代中期人类的历史又提供了一项新的资料（据新华社）
