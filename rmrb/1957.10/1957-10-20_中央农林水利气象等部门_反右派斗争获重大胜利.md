Xinhua News Agency, October 18th - The anti-Rightist struggle in the five ministries of the central state organs' agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy systems and the Central Meteorological Bureau has adopted flexible forms of struggle and has successively organized several climaxes of struggle. It has now achieved a major victory, and most of the Rightists have bowed their heads and confessed their guilt.

    The Ministry of Forest Industries and the Ministry of Forestry, after extensive debate, completely isolated Zhao Wenbi and Zhou Huiming, the core Rightists and confidants of Luo Longji, and other Rightists were also refuted beyond redemption. In the struggle, the Ministry of State Farms combined large and small meetings, conducted simultaneously in four battlefields, and organized several plenary sessions of reasoned struggle led by Assistant Minister and Rightist Liu Peizhi, pushing the movement to a climax. In late September, the Ministry of Agriculture held a week-long anti-Rightist reasoned struggle conference with more than 1,000 people, jointly refuting the reactionary words and deeds of Zeng Xianpu and 40 other Rightists, and crushing the two Rightist cliques headed by Zeng Xianpu and Chu Jishan. During the anti-Rightist process, the Ministry of Agriculture also exposed new Rightists such as Wang Zhenxin. Since October, in order to concentrate firepower and accelerate the encirclement and suppression of Rightists, many units of the Ministry of Water Resources have joined forces in continuous operations, launching struggles against Rightists such as Zhu Weiqing and Chen Bingliang. Units such as the Central Meteorological Bureau, the Central Meteorological Science Research Institute, and the Beijing Meteorological School have already seen seven Rightists, including Yao Qirun and Lin Ye, bow their heads and confess their guilt. Currently, the masses are continuing to struggle against Rightists such as Zhai Yuzong, who have not yet recognized their mistakes.

    In the movement, all units seized on the main issues in the reactionary words and deeds of the Rightists, mobilized the masses to present the facts and reason things out, and exposed their various conspiracies. The agricultural and other departments conducted a special rebuttal of the problem of Rightist leaders Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu inciting and fanning the flames at agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy symposiums in the early stages of the rectification campaign. Based on the common points of the reactionary words and deeds of the Rightists in their respective units, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of State Farms divided the issues into many specialized problems, and sternly rebuked the Rightists' fallacies of denying agricultural achievements, saying that "socialism is not democratic," "laymen cannot lead experts," and "farmers' lives are too hard" with vivid facts. The Central Meteorological Bureau used the concrete situation of the development and growth of the meteorological cause in the eight years since the founding of the country to powerfully refute the reactionary remarks of the Rightists that "meteorological work has no achievements and the Meteorological Bureau is dispensable."

    中央农林水利气象等部门
    反右派斗争获重大胜利
    据新华社18日讯  中央国家机关农、林、水利系统的五个部和中央气象局的反右派斗争，采取了灵活的斗争形式，连续组织了几次斗争高潮，现在已获得重大胜利，右派分子大都已低头认罪。
    森林工业部和林业部经过大争大辩，使罗隆基的心腹赵文璧、周慧明等右派骨干分子完全陷于孤立，其他右派分子也被驳得体无完肤。农垦部在斗争中，以大会和小会相结合，分四个战场同时进行，并以斗争部长助理、右派分子刘培植为主组织了几次全部性的说理斗争大会，使运动推向高潮。农业部在9月下旬召开了历时一周的一千多人的反右派说理斗争大会，联合批驳了曾宪朴等四十个右派分子的反动言行，摧垮了以曾宪朴、褚继善为首的两个右派小集团。在反右派过程中，农业部又揭发出新的右派分子王枕心等。水利部从10月份以来，为了集中火力加速围剿右派分子，许多单位联合起来，连续作战，与右派分子朱维清、陈秉良等展开了斗争。中央气象局、中央气象科学研究所、北京气象学校等单位已有姚启润、林晔等七个右派分子低头认罪，目前群众正在对尚未认清错误的翟裕宗等右派分子继续进行斗争。
    在运动中，各单位都抓住了右派分子反动言行中的主要问题，发动群众摆事实、讲道理，揭穿了他们的种种阴谋。农业等部门，对右派头子章伯钧、李伯球在整风初期召开农林、水利座谈会煽动点火的问题作为专题进行了驳斥。农业部、农垦部根据本单位右派分子反动言行的共同点，分为许多专门问题，分别用活生生的事实严正地斥责了右派分子否认农业成绩、说“社会主义不民主”、“外行不能领导内行”、“农民生活太苦”等等谬论。中央气象局用建国八年来气象事业发展壮大的具体情况，有力地驳斥了右派分子说“气象工作没有成绩、气象局可有可无”等反动言论。
