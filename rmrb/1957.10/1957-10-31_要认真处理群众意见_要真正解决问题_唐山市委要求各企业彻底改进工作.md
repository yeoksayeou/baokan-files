To Seriously Handle Mass Opinions, Genuinely Solve Problems:
Tangshan Municipal Party Committee Requires All Enterprises to Thoroughly Improve Work

(Our newspaper reporter Zhong Lin reports) The Tangshan Municipal Party Committee, on October 22nd, put forward its main requirements to the Party organizations of all enterprises in Tangshan: to quickly mobilize all cadres of the enterprises, especially those in leadership positions, in terms of ideology and organization, so that they implement the mass line and boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly throw themselves into the upsurge of rectifying work style and improving work.

During the high tide of airing views and speaking out freely from September 23rd to October 15th, workers of the first batch of 49 factories and mining enterprises in Tangshan undergoing rectification, raised a total of 403,500 opinions through big-character posters, group meetings, and forums. After the movement entered the rectification phase, including the opinions handled during the period of airing views and rectifying simultaneously, enterprise leaders have so far dealt with over 90,000 opinions. While many have been handled well and are satisfactory to the masses, the masses are very dissatisfied with the handling of some opinions. According to preliminary inspections, some problems still exist in the rectification of various units. The main ones are: some leaders only rely on themselves or a specialized agency composed of a few people to handle the opinions raised by the masses, and when handling these opinions, they often do not consult with relevant organizations and personnel, nor do they solicit the opinions of those who raised the opinions. Some units mechanically divide the work, assigning opinions related to livelihood and welfare to the trade union for handling, but the trade union is often unable to handle them; some opinions raised in big-character posters or meetings were not verified during processing due to errors in transcription or recording. Many problems were hastily handled without investigation and research, resulting in misattributions or irrelevance, causing dissatisfaction among the masses; some units did not first solve the problems that should be solved and could be solved, but instead first explained some problems that could not be solved to the masses, talking a lot about difficulties, which affected the positive emotions of the masses; some units simply pursued the quantity of opinions handled, and as a result, the opinions were handled, but the problems were not really solved, which also made the masses very dissatisfied.

There are many reasons for the above problems, but the main reason is that many cadres still do not have a clear understanding of the purpose and significance of the rectification movement, and their determination to rectify work style and improve work is not strong, and their enthusiasm is not high. Many cadres also do not have a clear understanding of the principle of firmly believing in the majority of the masses and relying on the majority of the masses to carry out rectification, and they dare not boldly let go and mobilize the strength of the masses to carry out rectification. And the leadership of the Party committees did not keep up with the needs of the development of the movement in time.

Therefore, the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee requires the Party organizations of all enterprises and institutions in Tangshan to strengthen the political and ideological leadership and organizational leadership of the rectification, and educate all cadres to recognize that the purpose of the rectification movement is to oppose bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, improve the political and ideological level of Party and state workers, and improve work to meet the needs of socialist transformation and socialist construction. Everyone must conscientiously participate in the upsurge of rectification in thought and action. In rectification, we must rely on the organization, we must follow the mass line, we must make good use of the organizational strength of departments and workshops, and combine with business to deal with problems. The handling of problems must adhere to principles, conduct investigation and research, and consult with relevant organizations and personnel, and also solicit the opinions of those who raised the opinions, so that it is possible to realistically and truly solve the problem satisfactorily. Attention should also be paid to the order in which problems are handled, and efforts should be made to distinguish between the important and the urgent, and to seek appropriateness, and not to handle them blindly and aimlessly. Attention should also be paid to mobilizing the masses to air views and speak out freely to help the leadership carry out rectification.

### 要认真处理群众意见　要真正解决问题  唐山市委要求各企业彻底改进工作

    要认真处理群众意见　要真正解决问题
    唐山市委要求各企业彻底改进工作
    本报讯　记者钟林报道：迅速把企业的全体干部、特别是作领导工作的干部，从思想上组织上发动起来，使他们贯彻执行群众路线，大胆地、坚决地、彻底地投入整顿作风、改进工作的热潮。这是中共唐山市委在22日向唐山各企业的党组织所提出来的主要要求。
    唐山市首批进行整风的四十九个厂矿企业单位的职工，从9月23日到10月15日的大鸣大放高潮当中，通过大字报、小组会和座谈会，共提出四十万三千五百多条意见。运动转入整改阶段以后，企业领导方面连同在大鸣大放期间边整边改所处理的意见，到目前为止，已有九万条以上。其中处理得较好使群众满意的固然不少，但群众对一部分意见的处理却很不满意。据初步检查，各单位在整改当中还存在着一些问题，主要的是：有的领导人员只靠自己或只靠由少数人组成的专门机构去处理群众提出来的意见，而且在处理这些意见的时候，往往不跟有关的组织和有关的人员商量，也不征求提意见人的意见，有的单位机械地分工，对有关生活福利的意见都交给工会处理，但工会往往无法处理；有些在大字报或会议上提出来的意见，由于抄写或记录错误，处理时未经核对，许多问题没有经过调查研究就草率进行处理，结果是张冠李戴或者牛头不对马嘴，引起群众不满；有的单位没有把应该解决也能够解决的问题首先解决，而是首先把一些没有条件解决的问题，去向群众进行解释，说了一大堆困难，结果影响群众的积极情绪；有的单位单纯追求处理多少条意见的数量，结果，意见是处理了，问题并没有真正解决，也使群众很不满意。
    产生上述这些问题的原因很多，但主要的是不少干部对整风运动的目的和意义认识还不明确，对整顿作风、改进工作的决心不大，积极性不高。不少干部对坚定地相信群众的多数、依靠群众的多数来进行整改这一方针的认识也不够明确，不敢大胆放手，发动群众力量来进行整改。而党委的领导也没有及时跟上运动发展的需要。
    因此，中共唐山市委要求唐山各企业单位的党组织，加强对整改的政治思想领导和组织领导，并教育全体干部，认识整风运动的目的在于反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，提高党和国家工作人员的政治思想水平，改进工作，以适应社会主义改造和社会主义建设的需要。大家必须从思想上、行动上认真地投入整改高潮当中去。在整改当中，必须依靠组织，必须走群众路线，要很好地运用科室和车间的组织力量，结合业务去处理问题。对问题的处理要坚持原则，要进行调查研究，要跟有关的组织和人员进行酝酿，还要征求提意见人的意见，才有可能实事求是地真正把问题解决得圆满。对于处理问题的先后顺序也要注意，要善于分别轻重缓急，力求适当，不要盲无目的地乱处理。还要注意发动群众大鸣大放，帮助领导进行整改。
