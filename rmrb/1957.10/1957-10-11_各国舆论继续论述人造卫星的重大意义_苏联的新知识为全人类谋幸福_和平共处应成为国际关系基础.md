Xinhua News Agency Report: Global opinions continue to focus on the successful launch of the first artificial Earth satellite by the Soviet Union.

William Foster, Honorary Chairman of the American Communist Party, wrote in the "Daily Worker": "Everyone agrees that the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial Earth satellite is a scientific event of great significance, marking a new era of scientific achievement. It is also the best proof that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system in technology and other aspects. This truly glorious achievement and many others are gifts to the Soviet Union's fortieth anniversary." The "Daily Worker" also published an editorial saying: "October 4, 1957, is a day of victory for mankind. On this day, mankind made a new leap towards the stars." It said: "Mankind owes a debt of gratitude to Soviet scientists and their many compatriots." The editorial pointed out that far-sighted scientists understand the significance of this event, "but some small people limited by narrow class views do not understand this." The newspaper said, "The United States must draw the conclusion that our foreign policy must undergo drastic changes. We must take peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition as the clear and definite basis of our policy."

British political commentator Gordon Schaffer wrote that in his files, he still keeps a clipping from an American magazine about a satellite manufacturing plan that is sufficient to guarantee American world hegemony. However, the Soviet Union is ahead. The Soviet Union does not talk about "world hegemony," but only about hoping for peace and being willing to introduce its new knowledge to seek happiness for all mankind. Schaffer wrote that the British are increasingly aware of this truth.

The British "News Chronicle" wrote: "The appearance of artificial satellites has not been given due evaluation. Russia's great progress in science has military, political, and economic significance in three aspects." The newspaper believes that in the military aspect, this satellite completely shattered the myth that the United States would not be threatened by artillery fire. In the political aspect, according to this newspaper, "the Western alliance obviously needs to reconsider in some aspects." Regarding the third aspect, the "News Chronicle" believes that this satellite launch will have dangerous consequences for the capitalist system. The newspaper said: "Now, the Soviet Union is an industrial giant. From the Russian point of view, artificial satellites are the prelude to the victory of their entire industry. This is a very real challenge to the entire economy of the West." The "News Chronicle" went on to say that in order to correctly estimate the significance of satellites, it is not only necessary to view the launch of satellites from the perspective of the balance of military power, "but also to immediately re-examine the way of political thinking; and to understand that this is one of the most serious economic warnings the West has received so far."

Egyptian religious leaders welcomed the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial Earth satellite. Hassan Ma'moun, the Mufti of Islam, said that Muslims bless the achievement of Soviet scientists because its purpose is to serve the progress, prosperity, peaceful coexistence, and world peace of mankind.

The Indonesian Nationalist Party's "Indonesian Torch" published a commentary on the 10th, saying that the Soviet Union's successful launch of the first artificial satellite was a victory over the Western bloc in the technology race. (Attached picture)
　　Schematic diagram of the orbit of an artificial Earth satellite
    The orbit of the Soviet artificial Earth satellite is close to elliptical. Due to the relative movement of the Earth and the orbital plane, the satellite shifts westward by about 1,500 kilometers at the latitude of Moscow each revolution than the last time. The displacement is larger in the equatorial area, about 2,500 kilometers. The angle of inclination between the orbital plane and the Earth's equatorial plane is 65 degrees. Therefore, the orbit of the artificial satellite passes over areas between the Antarctic Circle and the Arctic Circle on Earth.

### 各国舆论继续论述人造卫星的重大意义  苏联的新知识为全人类谋幸福  和平共处应成为国际关系基础

　　各国舆论继续论述人造卫星的重大意义
    苏联的新知识为全人类谋幸福  和平共处应成为国际关系基础
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论继续注视着苏联发射成功的第一颗人造地球卫星。
    美国共产党名誉主席威廉·福斯特在“工人日报”上写道：“大家都认为，苏联发射人造地球卫星是标志着科学成就新纪元的有巨大科学意义的一件事。它也是社会主义制度在技术和其他方面比资本主义制度优越的最好证明。这一真正光荣的成就和许多其他成就是献给苏联建国四十周年的礼物。”“工人日报”也发表社论说：“1957年10月4日是人类取得胜利的一天。在这一天，人类向星球作了一次新的跃进。”它说：“人类对苏联科学家和他们的许多同胞们负有感激之情。”社论指出：具有远见的科学家都了解这件事的意义，“但是为狭隘的阶级观点所局限的一些小人物却不了解这点。报纸说，“美国必须得出这样一种结论：我们的外交政策必须作剧烈的改变。我们必须把和平共处和和平竞赛作为我们政策的明确和肯定的基础。”
    英国政论家戈登·夏菲尔写道，在我的档案中还保存着一家美国杂志所刊载的关于足以保证美国的世界霸权的卫星制造计划草案的剪报。但是，苏联却走在前面了。苏联不谈“世界霸权”，而只谈希望和平和愿意把自己的新知识介绍出来为全人类谋幸福。夏菲尔写道，英国人越来越深刻地明白这种真实情况。
    英国“新闻纪事报”写道：“对人造卫星的出现还没有给予应有的评价。俄国在科学方面的巨大进展具有军事、政治和经济三方面的意义。”报纸认为，在军事方面，这个卫星彻底摧毁了关于美国不致受到炮火威胁的神话。在政治方面，据这家报纸的看法，“西方联盟显然需要在某些方面作重新考虑”。关于第三方面，“新闻纪事报”认为，这次卫星发射对于资本主义制度将产生危险的后果。报纸说：“现在，苏联已经是一个工业巨人。从俄国人的观点来看，人造卫星是他们整个工业方面胜利的先声。这是对西方整个经济的一个极现实的挑战。”“新闻纪事报”接着说，为了正确地估计卫星的意义，不仅要从军事实力平衡的观点来看卫星的发射，“还必需立即重新研究政治思想方式；并且要懂得，这是到目前为止西方所得到的一个最严重的经济方面的警告”。
    埃及宗教界领袖欢迎苏联发射出第一颗人造地球卫星。伊斯兰教教典说明官哈桑·马毛恩说，穆斯林祝福苏联科学家们的这一成就，因为它的目的是为人类的进步、繁荣、和平共处及世界和平的事业服务。
    印度尼西亚国民党的“印度尼西亚火炬报”10日发表评论说，苏联发射第一颗人造卫星成功，是在技术竞赛上击败了西方集团。（附图片）

    苏联人造地球卫星的轨道接近椭圆形。由于地球和轨道平面的相对运动，卫星每转一周，在莫斯科的纬度上就要比上一次偏西一千五百公里左右。在赤道一带位移较大，将为二千五百公里左右。轨道平面和地球赤道平面之间的倾斜角度是六十五度，因此，人造卫星的轨道约在地球南极圈和北极圈之间的各地区上空经过。
