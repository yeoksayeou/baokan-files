　　Soviet Science Steadily Achieves World First
    Academician Topchiev Discusses the Glorious Achievements of Soviet Science
    Moscow, October 12th (Report from Our Newspaper) – As the Soviet artificial satellite revolves around the Earth, a reporter interviewed Academician Topchiev, the Academic Secretary of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He spoke about the achievements of Soviet science over the past forty years, its superiority over capitalist countries, its development prospects, and its external influence, as follows:
    The achievements of Soviet science are well demonstrated by the Soviet artificial Earth satellite. This is a great festival for Soviet science, coinciding with the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution. The successful launch of the satellite is not merely the victory of a single branch of science, but the victory of physics, chemistry, mathematics, jet technology, radio technology, and other scientific and technological fields.
    From the earliest days of the founding of the nation, the Party and the government began to encourage the development of science. During periods of famine and economic destruction, Lenin had already assigned Russian scientists the task of studying domestic productive forces and natural resources; he supported the physiologist Pavlov, the radio engineer Bonch-Bruyevich, and the biologist Michurin. When the Soviet Republic was threatened by armed intervention from fourteen countries and domestic rebellion, facing a life-or-death crisis, Lenin signed decrees establishing new scientific research institutes. Subsequently, Lenin attracted all prominent scientists to participate in formulating the All-Russia Electrification Plan.
    Before the revolution, the Russian ruling clique regarded the Academy of Sciences as a kind of national decoration. At that time, the Academy of Sciences had only a few meteorological observatories and not a single scientific research institute. Now, the Soviet Academy of Sciences is an unparalleled union of scientific research institutions in the world. Over the past forty years, the number of researchers at the Soviet Academy of Sciences has increased more than a hundredfold, and funding has increased nearly a thousandfold. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, 1,121,000 experts graduated from national universities, a significant increase compared to the 625,000 during the Fourth Five-Year Plan period.
    When the Soviet Union embarked on the First Five-Year Plan, an American publication published an article saying that the Russians had put forward the slogan of catching up with the United States, but were walking a muddy, uneven road, with builders traveling in ox carts. The Americans were very surprised that a country without its own industry wanted to compete with the most developed capitalist country. Now, Soviet scientists are the first to utilize atomic energy in industry, establishing the world's first atomic power station. The first Soviet icebreaker equipped with an atomic engine will begin sailing in 1958; this icebreaker will be able to sail for two or three years without having to enter port to refuel. The Soviet Union has already built a ten-billion electron volt microparticle accelerator and is designing a fifty-billion electron volt microparticle accelerator. The Soviet "Tu-104" jet aircraft has traveled to various countries and is considered the best jet aircraft in the world. Its designer, Tupolev, is an academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. As for the intercontinental ballistic missiles and artificial Earth satellites recently successfully launched by the Soviet Union, they have surpassed capitalist countries even further.
    Science now occupies a prominent position. What now determines the outcome of competition is not just the number of factories. Soviet science has become a productive force. The small artificial satellite has had a sobering effect in the West. There is a high call for re-examining military treaties.
    In the Soviet Union, the Party and the government spare no effort to develop science, and scientists, as members connected to the people by flesh and blood, work wholeheartedly for the people. In capitalist countries, do capitalists want to develop any scientific theories? All they need are those scientific fields that can generate profit. That is why Soviet science is capturing first place step by step.
    The future of Soviet science is bright. The Soviet Academy of Sciences is increasingly transforming into a collaborative center for various scientific research institutions. It can guide various scientific research institutions to work together to solve a problem, such as building atomic power stations, launching artificial satellites, and manufacturing huge turbines for hydroelectric power stations. In capitalist countries, there cannot be such good cooperation. This is another advantage of the socialist system. Soviet scientists cooperate closely with scientists from socialist countries. Chinese and Soviet scientists are studying the Heilongjiang (Amur) River issue together. Researchers from socialist countries participate in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research.
    Before the revolution, Russia had only occasional scientific contact with foreign countries. Before the war, the Soviet Union also had limited foreign scientific contact, but after the war, it became more and more extensive year by year. The Soviet Academy of Sciences participates in almost all major international scientific conferences. This shows that the status and prestige of Soviet science in the world is increasing day by day.

　　苏联科学稳步取得世界第一
    托普切夫谈苏联科学的光辉成就
    本报莫斯科12日电　当苏联人造卫星绕着地球旋转的时候，记者访问了苏联科学院学术秘书长托普切夫院士。他就苏联科学四十年来的成就和优越于资本主义国家的地方及其发展的前途和对外的影响，发表了如下谈话：
    苏联科学的成就很好地表现在苏联的人造地球卫星上。这是苏联科学的大节日。这个节日赶上十月革命四十周年。卫星的发射成功，不是某一门科学的胜利，而是物理学、化学、数学、喷气技术、无线电技术和其他部门科学技术的胜利。
    党和政府从建国的最初日子起，就开始鼓励科学的发展。在饥饿和经济被破坏时期，列宁已经给俄国科学家以研究国内生产力和自然富源的任务；支持了生理学家巴甫洛夫、无线电学家孟奇—布鲁也维奇、生物学家米丘林。当苏维埃共和国受到了十四国武装干涉和国内叛乱的威胁，面临着生死存亡关头的时候，列宁签署了建立新的科学研究所的法令。接着，列宁把所有著名的科学家都吸引来参加制订全俄电气化计划。
    在革命前，俄国统治集团把科学院看作是国家的一种装饰。当时科学院只有几个气象台，没有一个科学研究所。现在，苏联科学院是世界上空前的科学研究机关的联合。四十年来，苏联科学院的研究员增长了一百倍以上，经费增长了近一千倍。在第五个五年计划期间，从全国高等学校毕业了一百十二万一千名专家，比较第四个五年计划期间的六十二万五千名，增加了很多。
    当苏联着手实行第一个五年计划的时候，美国刊物登了一篇论文说，俄国人提出赶过美国的口号，但走的是泥泞满地、坎坷不平的道路，建设者乘着牛车走。美国人很奇怪，这个没有本国工业的国家却想和资本主义最发达的国家比赛。现在，苏联科学家首先在工业中利用原子能，建立了世界第一个原子能发电站。苏联第一艘装有原子能发动机的破冰船将于1958年开始航行；这艘破冰船能够航行两三年而不必入港添加燃料。苏联已经建成一百亿电子伏特的微粒子加速器，正在设计五百亿电子伏特的微粒子加速器。苏联“图—104”喷气式飞机到过各国，被认为是世界上最好的喷气飞机，它的设计师图波列夫是苏联科学院院士。至于苏联最近发射成功的洲际弹道火箭和人造地球卫星，更是超过了资本主义国家。
    现在科学占了显要地位。现在决定竞赛胜负的，已经不仅是工厂的数目。苏联的科学已成为生产力。小小的人造卫星在西方发生了清醒剂的影响。重新审查军事公约的呼声很高。
    在苏联，党和政府不惜力量发展科学，科学家作为和人民血肉相连的分子，全心全意为人民工作。而在资本主义国家，资本家难道想要发展什么科学理论？他们所需要的只是能取得利润的那些科学部门。这就是为什么苏联科学会一步又一步夺取第一。
    苏联科学的前途远大。苏联科学院日益转变为各个科学研究机关协作的中心。它能够引导各个科学研究机关共同努力解决一个问题，如建设原子能发电站、发射人造卫星、制造水电站的巨大涡轮机等。在资本主义国家，不能有这样好的协作。这是社会主义制度又一个优越性。苏联科学家和社会主义各国的科学家密切地合作着。中苏两国科学家一起研究黑龙江问题。社会主义国家的研究员参加联合核子研究所。
    在革命前，俄国只偶尔有对外科学联系。战前苏联对外科学联系也不多，战后则一年比一年广泛起来。苏联科学院参加了几乎一切大的国际科学会议。这说明苏联科学在世界的地位和威信日益提高。
