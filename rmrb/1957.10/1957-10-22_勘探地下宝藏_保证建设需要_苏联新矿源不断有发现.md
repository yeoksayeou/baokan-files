Exploring Underground Treasures to Ensure Construction Needs
Soviet Union Constantly Discovers New Mineral Resources

(Our Moscow Dispatch, October 21st) Soviet Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection, Antropov, answered questions posed by our reporter. The questions and answers are as follows:

Question: What achievements has the Soviet Union made in prospecting for new mineral deposits in the past forty years?

Answer: In the past forty years, it can be said that the Soviet Union has discovered new mineral resources everywhere: in the old industrial areas of the country, that is, in those places where it was believed that the reserves had been exhausted, new mineral resources have been discovered; in new areas that have not been explored, new mineral resources have also been discovered.

Among the outstanding discoveries of Soviet geological workers, the following regions can be mentioned: the unparalleled Volga-Ural oil region, which has more than one hundred huge oil fields; the Karaganda, Fergana, Pechora, Ubagan, Minusinsk, Ulug-Khem, South Yakutia, and other coal regions. The actual coal reserves of the Soviet Union are no less than 8.5 trillion tons, which is 33 times the reserves of Tsarist Russia; the Central, Ural, Kazakhstan, Siberia, and other iron ore regions, with iron ore reserves exceeding 70 billion tons, which is 35 times more than before the revolution.

Geological workers have made significant achievements in identifying rich resources of non-ferrous metals and rare metals, such as copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, nickel, cobalt, titanium, tin, tungsten, molybdenum, antimony, mercury, tantalum, niobium, beryllium, lithium, cesium, etc.

The discovery of huge diamond deposits is the most outstanding achievement in recent years. Many resources of chemical raw materials and mineral fertilizers have also been found for agriculture and construction.

Question: Please compare the mineral resources and their utilization between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries.

Answer: The Soviet Union has a vast territory, so it is rich in mineral resources, but before the Great October Socialist Revolution, these resources were useless. The Tsarist government did not explore mineral resources and utilize domestic minerals, preferring to import them from abroad; coal was imported from Britain, phosphate fertilizer from Morocco, potash salt from Germany, and even building stones and paving stones were imported.

The Soviet state could not tolerate this situation. In the early days of the Soviet regime, Lenin, in his "Draft Plan of Scientific and Technical Work" (1918), had already identified the raw material problem as one of the fundamental problems, without solving which the Soviet system could not be consolidated and developed.

According to Lenin's instructions, geological exploration of unprecedented scale has been and is being carried out in the Soviet Union. As a result of these explorations, the Soviet Union has today established a truly vast mineral raw material base.

Now, the Soviet Union is guaranteed to have the various minerals needed for the development of the national economy for many years to come, and can provide fraternal assistance to the countries of the socialist camp.

In the past seventeen to twenty years alone, the mineral resources of the Soviet Union have expanded greatly: iron has increased fivefold, manganese fourfold, coal threefold, oil fivefold, bauxite nineteenfold, and lead more than threefold.

The Soviet Union holds a leading position in the world in terms of reserves of important minerals such as coal, oil, iron, manganese, chromium, copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, nickel, cobalt, tungsten, etc.

Question: Please talk about the future work prospects of the Soviet Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection.

Answer: According to the directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, geological workers should ensure that from 1956 to 1960, the proven reserves of rich iron ore and nickel ore increase by 30% to 35% respectively; the reserves of copper, bauxite, titanium, phosphorus, and boron increase by 40% to 45%; the reserves of lead and tin increase by 55% to 60%; the reserves of oil increase by 65% to 70%, etc.

These tasks, which are significant in scale and importance, are being successfully completed. In the coming five, six, and seven years, geological workers face the task of identifying mineral resources that are sufficient to meet the needs of various industries for at least forty to fifty years.

The task of developing industry in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union is equally important, as it is where rich mineral resources are concentrated. The directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union paid special attention to the eastern regions, instructing geological workers to expand the exploration of oil, natural gas, coking coal, iron and non-ferrous metals, chemical raw materials, and other mineral deposits there as much as possible.

In the Far East, Eastern and Western Siberia, the Buryat-Mongol and Yakut Autonomous Republics, and in the Kazakh, Uzbek, Tajik, and Turkmen Republics, new mining, metallurgical, and other enterprises are being established on the basis of the mineral deposits already discovered in these regions. The development of industry in these regions requires the service of the huge thermal power plants and hydropower stations that have been built and are under construction. We have the necessary technical equipment and scientifically sound geological data, and we firmly believe that we will succeed. (Attached picture)

### 勘探地下宝藏　保证建设需要  苏联新矿源不断有发现

    勘探地下宝藏　保证建设需要
    苏联新矿源不断有发现
    本报莫斯科21日电　苏联地质和矿藏保护部部长安特罗波夫就本报记者所提问题作了答复。问答如下：
    问：苏联四十年来在勘查新的矿层方面取得了些什么成就？
    答：苏联四十年来可以说到处发现了新矿源：在全国旧工业区，也就是那些被认为蕴藏量已经用尽的地方，发现了新矿源；在没有考察过的新区，也发现了新矿源。
    在苏联地质工作人员的卓越发现中，可以举出如下地区：无双的伏尔加—乌拉尔石油区，那里共有一百个以上巨大的油田；卡拉干达、费尔干、彼绍拉、乌巴干、米努辛斯克、乌卢格亨木、南雅库特及其他煤区，苏联煤的实际蕴藏量不下八万五千亿吨，为沙皇俄国蕴藏量的三十三倍；中部、乌拉尔、哈萨克斯坦、西伯利亚及其他铁矿区，铁的蕴藏量超过七百亿吨，为革命前的三十五倍。
    地质工作人员在查明有色金属和稀有金属的丰富资源上取得了重大的成就，这些金属是：铜、铅、锌、铝、镍、钴、钛、锡、钨、钼、锑、汞、钽、铌、铍、锂、铯等等。
    巨大的金钢石矿床的发现，是近年最出色的收获。为农业和建筑也找到了不少化学原料和矿质肥料的资源。
    问：请比较苏联与资本主义国家的矿藏及其利用。
    答：苏联领土广阔，所以矿藏丰富，但是在伟大的十月社会主义革命以前，这些富源没有用处。沙皇政府不去勘查矿藏和利用本国的矿物，宁肯从国外输入；从英国输入了煤，从摩洛哥输入了磷肥，从德国输入了钾盐，甚至建筑用的石块和铺路用的石条，都是进口的。
    苏维埃国家不能容忍这种情况。在苏维埃政权建立的初期，列宁在他的“科学技术工作计划初稿”（1918年）中已经把原料问题订为根本问题之一，不解决它，苏维埃制度就不能巩固和发展。
    根据列宁的指示，在苏联进行了和进行着空前规模的地质勘查。由于这些勘查，苏联今天建立了真正是庞大的矿产原料基地。
    现在，苏联保证有为今后多年国民经济发展所需要的各种矿物，而且可以给社会主义阵营的国家以兄弟般的援助。
    仅仅在最近十七年到二十年中，苏联矿物资源就扩大了许多：铁扩大了五倍，锰四倍，煤三倍，石油五倍，铝土矿十九倍，铅三倍多。
    重要的矿物，如煤、石油、铁、锰、铬、铜、铅、锌、铝、镍、钴、钨等等的蕴藏量，苏联在世界占着主要地位。
    问：请谈谈苏联地质和矿藏保护部在今后工作远景计划。
    答：按照苏共第二十次代表大会的指令，地质工作人员应该保证在1956年到1960年中，使丰富的铁矿和镍矿的分别蕴藏量增长30％到35％；铜、铝土、钛、磷和硼的蕴藏量增长40％到45％；铅和锡的蕴藏量增长55％到60％；石油的蕴藏量增长65％到70％，等等。
    这些规模和意义都是重大的任务，正在顺利地完成着。在今后五、六、七年期间，在地质工作人员面前摆着这样的任务：查明至少足供四五十年各种工业需要的矿物资源。
    工业向苏联东部地区发展的任务也是同样重要的，那里集中着丰富的矿物资源。苏共第二十次代表大会的指令特别注意东部地区，责成地质工作人员在那里尽量扩大石油、天然气、焦煤、铁和有色金属、化学原料等等矿层的勘探工作。
    在远东、西伯利亚东部和西部、布略特蒙古和雅库特自治共和国，在哈萨克、乌兹别克、塔吉克和土库曼共和国，在这些地区已经发现的矿层的基础上，建立新的采矿、冶金和其他企业。这些地区工业的发展，要求已经建成和正在建设的巨大的热电厂和水电站为它服务。我们掌握着必需的技术器材和有科学根据的地质资料，坚信一定成功。（附图片）
