    This newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an on the 24th: In November, a massive water conservancy construction movement will emerge throughout Shaanxi Province, requiring the completion of the expansion of 2.5 million mu of paddy fields this winter and next spring. This is the decision made at the enlarged meeting of the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee, which closed on the 23rd.

    After hearing the transmission of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CCP, the CCP county party secretaries from various counties in Guanzhong immediately notified their respective counties of the meeting's spirit, requiring the counties to quickly make various preparations for water conservancy construction. Currently, many counties have made various preparations for water conservancy construction. For example, in counties such as Pucheng and Dali, the county, township, and various agricultural cooperatives have organized leadership structures for carrying out the water conservancy construction movement, as well as searching for water sources and imparting technology, to welcome the high tide of water conservancy construction.

    Eleven thousand cadres from Shaanxi Province have gone to the countryside to participate in labor production and strengthen the grassroots (of which 50,000 are temporarily transferred to the grassroots to help with work). They will work with the broad masses to carry out a large-scale water conservancy construction movement.

    This water conservancy construction movement will be launched on the basis of the intense struggle against drought. In the anti-drought movement, agricultural cooperatives in various places have launched activities such as building medium-sized and small reservoirs and canals, and digging wells. These activities have achieved great success, encouraging the masses' enthusiasm for water conservancy construction and overcoming drought. At present, some counties have completed or overfulfilled this year's task of expanding irrigation area. For example, Wugong County has overfulfilled the annual plan for expanding irrigation area by two times, and now has decided to complete the task of expanding irrigation area by another 20,000 mu before the end of this year.

    Shaanxi Province is rich in water resources. The province has more than 50 rivers of all sizes, with a water storage capacity (excluding underground water sources) of about 51.4 billion cubic meters, of which about 25.7 billion cubic meters can be utilized (currently only 5.9 billion cubic meters are utilized). Since liberation, Shaanxi Province has made great achievements in water conservancy construction, and the increased area of irrigated land has exceeded more than twice the area of irrigated land before liberation. Some counties, such as Gaoling County, have achieved water conservancy throughout the county. In other counties and cities, such as Jingyang, Dali, Mei County, Xi'an City, and Chang'an, the average per capita (based on the agricultural population) is one to two mu of irrigated land. In the past few years, whether in the arid northern Shaanxi mountain area, the Guanzhong Plain area, or the southern Shaanxi area, a set of experiences in building small-scale water conservancy projects suitable for local conditions has been created. Such as the "through-river wells" created in the Yan'an area of ​​northern Shaanxi, the small canals in Guanzhong, and the "winter paddy fields," "ponds," "thousand-work dams," and "ten-thousand-work dams" in southern Shaanxi. These small-scale water conservancy projects have the advantages of saving labor, saving money, and benefiting in the same year they are built. Agricultural cooperatives in various places generally have the ability to build this type of water conservancy project. For example, most of the 150,000 mu of irrigated land built in Pucheng County was built by agricultural cooperatives at their own expense.

    However, at present, a small number of cadres and masses in some areas still do not have enough understanding of the power of the masses. They have set the targets for water conservancy construction this year too low, and the progress is also very slow. In order to carry out the water conservancy construction movement well, the meeting believes that it is currently necessary to oppose right-leaning conservative sentiments, and requires party organizations in various places to organize debates on water conservancy issues among cadres and the masses, so that cadres and the masses can clearly understand the benefits of water conservancy construction, and clearly understand whether water conservancy construction can be carried out locally and who to rely on for construction. Only in this way can we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and rapidly develop the water conservancy construction movement.

    This newspaper's dispatch from Nanchang on the 24th: The CCP Jiangxi Provincial Committee held an emergency telephone conference at 7:00 p.m. on October 22. In addition to studying the rush harvesting and planting, according to the spirit of the Third Plenary Session on launching a major agricultural water conservancy movement this winter and next spring, the conference studied how to launch a high tide of water conservancy construction throughout the province and strive to complete and overfulfill the water conservancy construction plan for this winter and next spring.

    The meeting focused on how to solve the problem of funding for water conservancy construction. If sufficient funds are not raised, water conservancy construction cannot be accelerated. The meeting believes that although the state has allocated 19 million yuan for water conservancy to the entire province this year, which is several million yuan more than last year, this funding is not enough to vigorously carry out water conservancy construction. How to solve the funding problem? We should not reach out to the state for money, but should make every effort to raise funds ourselves under reasonable and legal principles, and fully utilize the manpower, materials, and financial resources of the masses. The meeting listed typical examples of self-raising water conservancy funds and called on the entire province to universally carry out the work of self-raising water conservancy funds. For example, the Ji'an Special Zone plans to self-raise 4.43 million yuan for water conservancy funds, which is more than two times more than the funds allocated to them by the province. The Nanchang Special Zone plans to self-raise 5 million yuan for water conservancy funds, and has now raised 2.6 million yuan, of which Fengcheng County can reach 1.8 million yuan, and Pingxiang County can reach 550,000 yuan. Leping County in the Shangrao Special Zone has self-raised 260,000 yuan for water conservancy funds. The meeting believes that the spirit of self-raising water conservancy funds in the above-mentioned places is very good. If the self-raised water conservancy funds in various places can reach the proportion of the Ji'an Special Zone, then the entire province may exceed the original annual plan for water conservancy construction by one or two times.

    Regarding the methods of raising water conservancy funds, the meeting proposed: (1) Locally raised grain can be mostly or entirely used for water conservancy; (2) Agricultural cooperatives with good harvests can retain more public accumulation funds for water conservancy construction; (3) Appropriately collect a portion of water conservancy fees based on the area of ​​benefited fields and the ability of farmers to pay; (4) Fully utilize ponds and reservoirs to raise fish, and use its profits to repair water conservancy; (5) Utilize a part or most of the relief funds for work relief (but the orphaned, widowed, and disabled who cannot engage in labor should still be given relief); (6) Mobilize cadres and the masses to donate funds for water conservancy construction on a voluntary basis. The meeting particularly emphasized that we should make every effort to think of more ways to raise funds under reasonable and legal principles to accelerate the speed of water conservancy construction.

    中共陕西省委扩大会议作出决定
    开展辩论  克服右倾  大兴水利
    江西千方百计自筹经费发展水利建设
    本报西安24日电　11月份，陕西全省将出现一个声势浩大的兴修水利运动，要求在今冬明春完成扩大二百五十万亩水田面积的任务。这是23日闭幕的中共陕西省委会扩大会议作出的决定。
    出席这次会议的中共关中各县县委书记，在听完中共八届三中全会的传达以后，就立即把会议精神通知本县，要求县里迅速为兴修水利做好各项准备工作。目前，已经有很多县做好兴修水利的各项准备工作。如蒲城、大荔等县，县、乡和各农业社都组织了开展兴修水利运动的领导机构，以及寻找水源和传授技术等工作，来迎接兴修水利的高潮。
    陕西省有十一万名干部先后到农村参加劳动生产和充实基层（其中有五万名是临时抽调到基层帮助工作的），他们将同广大群众一起，开展大规模的兴修水利运动。
    这次兴修水利运动，将在紧张的抗旱斗争的基础上开展起来。各地农业社在抗旱运动中，都展开了兴修中、小型水库、水渠和打井等活动。这些活动获得了很大的成绩，鼓舞了群众兴修水利，战胜旱灾的热情。目前，有些县已经完成或超额完成了今年扩大灌溉面积的任务。如武功县已经超额两倍完成全年扩大灌溉面积的计划，现在又决定在今年年底以前再完成扩大灌溉面积两万亩的任务。
    陕西省水源丰富，全省有大小河流五十多条，储水量（不包括地下水源）约有五百一十四亿公方，其中可能利用的约有二百五十七亿公方（目前只利用了五十九亿公方）。解放以来，陕西省兴修水利已获得很大成绩，增加的水地面积超过解放前的水地面积二倍以上。有的县——如高陵县已在全县实现了水利化。其它如泾阳、大荔、郿县、西安市、长安等十四个县市，按农业人口计算，平均每人已有一亩到二亩水地。几年来，无论在干旱的陕北山区，关中平川地区和陕南地区，都创造出一套适应当地情况的兴修小型水利的经验。如陕北延安地区创造的“透河井”，关中的小型渠道，陕南的“冬水田”、“陂塘”、“千工堰”和“万工堰”等。这些小型水利工程都具备了省工、省钱和当年修当年获利等优点，各地农业社一般的都有能力兴修这种水利。如蒲城县兴修的十五万亩水地，绝大部分是农业社出钱出人兴修的。
    但是，目前有少数地区的干部和群众，对群众的力量还认识不足，他们今年兴修水利的指标订得偏低了，进度也很迟缓。为了很好的开展兴修水利运动，会议认为目前必须反对右倾保守情绪，要求各地党组织在干部和群众中组织对水利问题的辩论，使干部和群众明确兴修水利的好处，明确当地能否兴修水利和靠谁兴修等问题。只有这样，才能充分发挥群众的积极性，使兴修水利运动迅速的开展起来。
    本报南昌24日电　中共江西省委在10月22日晚七时召开紧急电话会议，除研究突击抢收抢种外，根据三中全会要求在今冬明春掀起兴修农田水利大运动的精神，对在全省范围内如何掀起一个兴修水利高潮，争取完成和超额完成今冬明春兴修水利计划的问题，作了研究。
    会议集中地研究了如何解决兴修水利经费的问题。经费不设法筹集充裕，就不能加速水利建设。会议认为：今年国家拨给全省水利经费一千九百万元，虽然比去年多几百万元，但是要大力兴修水利，这笔经费是不足的。怎样解决经费问题呢？不应伸手向国家要，而应在合理合法的原则下，千方百计地自筹经费，充分发挥群众的人力物力财力。会议列举自筹水利经费的典型事例，号召全省普遍开展水利经费自筹工作。例如：吉安专区计划自筹水利经费四百四十三万元，比省拨给他们的经费多两倍以上。南昌专区计划自筹水利经费五百万元，现在已筹集到二百六十万元，其中丰城县可达到一百八十万元，萍乡县达到五十五万元。上饶专区的乐平县已自筹水利经费二十六万元。会议认为：以上这些地方自筹水利经费的精神很好，如果各地自筹水利经费都能达到吉安专区的比例，那么全省就有可能超过原订兴修水利年度计划的一倍或两倍。
    关于筹集水利经费的办法，会议提出：（1）地方自筹粮可以大部或全部用于水利；（2）丰收的农业社可以多留些公积金用于水利建设；（3）根据田亩受益面积和农民负担能力，适当收一部分水利费；（4）充分利用水塘水库养鱼，用它的盈利来修水利；（5）利用救济款一部或大部分以工代赈（但不能从事劳动的孤寡残废仍应救济）；（6）动员干部和群众在自愿原则下捐献兴修水利款。会议特别强调：应当千方百计多想办法，在合理合法的原则下筹集经费，加速水利建设速度。
