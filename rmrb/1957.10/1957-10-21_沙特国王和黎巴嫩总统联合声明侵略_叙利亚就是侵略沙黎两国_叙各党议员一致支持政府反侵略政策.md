Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 20th – Reports state that Saudi Arabian King Saud and Lebanese President Camille Chamoun issued a joint statement on the 19th, saying that they consider any aggression against Syria or other Arab countries as aggression against Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, regardless of where such aggression comes from.

Saud and Chamoun emphasized in the joint statement, issued at the conclusion of their ten-day talks, that "respect for the independence of Arab countries and non-interference in their internal affairs are prerequisites for maintaining and strengthening peace in the Middle East and the world."

In the statement, they reaffirmed that the two countries are united with other Arab countries and expressed their willingness to continue to work for a unified attitude of Arab countries towards current Arab political events.

The statement said that the two countries are determined to fulfill their obligations under the Arab League Charter, the Arab Joint Defense Treaty, the United Nations Charter, and the Bandung Conference Communiqué, and are willing to make their Arab and international policies comply with these obligations.

Saud is scheduled to return home today. He arrived in Beirut on October 10. During his stay in Beirut, in addition to holding talks with the Lebanese President, he also had extensive contact with envoys sent by other Arab countries in the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th – According to TASS Beirut, 19th: Newspapers report that Saudi Arabian King Saud has written to Turkish President Bayar saying that Saudi Arabia will support Syria in the event of aggression against Syria.

The report said that in a private letter to Bayar, Saud, regarding the continued Turkish troop build-up on the Syrian border, asked Bayar to pay attention to the threat that the current situation on the Syrian-Turkish border poses to the peace and security of the Near East people.

According to "Al-Akhbar," Iraqi Prime Minister Ayoubi has notified the Turkish government through diplomatic channels that Iraq will support Syria in the event of any attack on Syria, even though it is a member of the Baghdad Pact.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th – Damascus News: Syrian Acting Foreign Minister Kalas said in Parliament on the 19th that Turkey has concentrated a large number of troops on the Syrian border, attempting to launch a "lightning attack" on Syria with the help of Israel and the presence of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean.

After listening to Kalas's report, the parliament unanimously passed the government's foreign policy, which is based on opposing foreign military treaties and adhering to active neutrality.

In his report, Kalas also said that Syria has notified the United Nations, requesting member states to pay attention to the situation on the Syrian border that threatens international peace. He said: "Our eyes are on the United Nations, hoping that the United Nations will pass a resolution to restore calm and stability in the Middle East."

Kalas denounced Turkey's response to Syria's protests. He said: "Although Turkish officials have issued statements affirming that they do not want to attack Syria, the assembled troops are still on our border and have even increased; at the same time, the Turks say they are watching the so-called development of the Syrian situation with great concern." He pointed out: "This is blatant interference in our internal affairs."

Kalas said that the United States continues to stand with Turkey. The United States also said that Syria poses a threat to Turkey and hurriedly announced that it would protect Turkey, even though it is Turkey that is massively gathering troops, while Syria has not done so.

Many parliamentarians with various political inclinations expressed their support for the government's foreign policy. They denounced the unfounded accusations against Syria.

    声明说，两国决心履行它们在阿拉伯国家联盟公约、阿拉伯联合防御条约、联合国宪章以及万隆会议公报上所承担的义务，并且愿意使他们的阿拉伯政策和国际政策符合于这些义务。
    沙特定于今天回国。他是在10月10日到达贝鲁特的。他在贝鲁特期间除了同黎巴嫩总统会谈外，还同中东其他阿拉伯国家派来的使节进行了广泛的接触。
    新华社20日讯  据塔斯社贝鲁特19日讯：据报纸报道，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特曾经写信给土耳其总统拜亚尔说，一旦发生对叙利亚的侵略，沙特阿拉伯将支持叙利亚。
    消息说，沙特在给拜亚尔的一封私人信件中，就土耳其军队继续在叙利亚边境集结一事，要求拜亚尔注意目前叙土边境的局势对于近东人民的和平和安全的威胁。
    据“新闻报”报道，伊拉克首相阿尤比已经通过外交途径通知土耳其政府，一旦叙利亚受到任何进攻的时候，伊拉克将支持叙利亚，虽然它是巴格达条约成员国。
    新华社20日讯  大马士革消息：叙利亚代理外交部长卡拉斯19日在议会中说，土耳其已经把大量军队集中到叙利亚边境，企图在以色列的帮助下和美国第六舰队驻在地中海的情况下对叙利亚发动“闪电进攻”。
    议会在听取卡拉斯的报告之后，一致通过了政府的外交政策，这个政策是以反对外国军事条约、坚持积极中立为基础的。
    卡拉斯在他的报告中还说，叙利亚已经照会联合国，要求会员国注意叙利亚边境上威胁着国际和平的局势。他说：“我们的眼睛都看着联合国，希望联合国将通过决议来恢复中东的平静和稳定。”
    卡拉斯斥责了土耳其对叙利亚抗议的答复。他说：“尽管土耳其的官员们发表声明肯定说他们不想进攻叙利亚，可是集结的军队仍然在我们的边境上，甚至还增加了；在这同时土耳其人说他们正在很关心地注视着所谓叙利亚局势的发展。”他指出：“这是明目张胆地干涉我们的内政。”
    卡拉斯说，美国继续和土耳其站在一起。美国也说叙利亚对土耳其形成威胁，并且急急忙忙地宣布它要保护土耳其，尽管是土耳其在大规模地集结军队，而叙利亚并没有这样做。
    许多具有各种不同政治倾向的议员都表示支持政府的外交政策。他们斥责对叙利亚的没有根据的指责。
