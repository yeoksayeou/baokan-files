    A Friend Comes From Afar
  　Xu Qinwen
    A comrade from the Cultural Bureau told me: There is an Indian student at Peking University who wants to talk to me about Mr. Lu Xun. He is going to Shanghai early the next morning and hopes to meet me in the afternoon. I waited at home. But until evening, I didn't receive any notification. I knew that he had gone to Shaoxing to visit "Lu Xun's Former Residence" and couldn't return in time, so he probably had to change the date of his departure to Shanghai.
    The sky was already dim. Suddenly, the doorbell rang. My child went to open the door, muttered something at the door, and came back to say, "Dad, someone has come to see you!" This made me uneasy. Since someone was visiting, I had to spend a few words with them; if I received a notification to meet with my Indian friend, I would have difficulty managing both. But under the electric light, I saw clearly that the person who came to see me was indeed the Indian student. After reading the letter of introduction, I knew that he already had a Chinese name, called Shen Nalan. I was surprised that he had come alone; but listening to his fluent Chinese, I knew that people on the road in the dim evening wouldn't regard him as a foreigner. He said that he had not only visited "Lu Xun's Former Residence" and the home of Mr. Lu Xun's maternal grandmother, but also saw the model of Runtu, a character in the novel "Hometown," and Runtu's hometown, so he returned late. I said that when Mr. Tagore came to China before, some people didn't understand why he always praised India's natural scenery and historical events. Mr. Lu Xun believed that under the rule of British imperialism at the time, it was inconvenient to say it directly. Mr. Tagore was trying his best to awaken his compatriots to rise up in revolution. Mr. Shen Nalan said that he had heard a little about this matter in Beijing.
    From the many questions that Mr. Shen Nalan raised about Mr. Lu Xun, it can be seen that he already had an in-depth study of Mr. Lu Xun. He was not only familiar with Mr. Lu Xun's works, but also understood much of our modern history in order to explore the historical background of the works. Living in Asia, having been invaded by imperialists, the past tragic events are easy to understand, right? It was truly like meeting an old friend at first sight. When I saw him off, I felt that he was originally a close friend.
    I remember in August the year before last, when the Indian Cultural Delegation came to Hangzhou, it was Mr. Chendar's birthday. We celebrated his birthday for him, and he said that this birthday was as pleasant as spending it at home; several female representatives made pastries for us to eat, as if they were originally close sisters. Due to Mr. Chendar's translation, we learned that the line of Burmese characters on the Lingyin stone tablet meant "a piece of jade in the lotus flower." In Lingyin, not only the statues of Sakyamuni Buddha and others, but also many carvings on the stone walls are full of Indian flavor. Every time I see Indian films and Indian artistic expressions, I always feel familiar. Indeed, since the Xuanzang Master's pilgrimage to the west, cultural exchanges between our country and India have had a history of more than 1,300 years. As Mr. Chendar said, "We are neighbors, we are good friends." Recently, the Vice President of the Republic of India, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, came to our country. Undoubtedly, the friendship between China and India will be further deepened. The friendship between our two countries, China and India, is truly deep and far-reaching!

    有朋自远方来
  　许钦文
    文化局的一位同志同我说：有位在北京大学的印度留学生要同我谈谈关于鲁迅先生的事情，他第二天一早要去上海，希望我在下午和他见面。我就在家里等着。可是一直到傍晚，没有接到通知，我知道他到绍兴去访问“鲁迅故居”，一时回不来，恐怕要改变到上海去的日期了。
    天色已经暗沉沉，忽然门铃响了起来，我的孩子去开门，他在门口叽叽咕咕地讲了阵，回来说，“爸爸，有人来看你！”这使得我不安，既然有人来访，总得陪着谈几句；如果得到同印度朋友会面的通知，我将难以分身。可是在电灯光下看清楚，进来看我的就是印度留学生。看了介绍信，知道他已有了个中国姓名，叫做沈纳兰。我惊讶他的独个人来到；可是听了他的流畅的中国话，知道在这样傍晚的天色中，路上的人也是不会把他当作外国人看待的了。他说他不但访问了“鲁迅故居”和鲁迅先生的外婆家，也去看了小说“故乡”中的人物闰土的模型和闰土的故乡，所以回来得晚了。我说以前泰戈尔先生来中国，有些人对于他的老是赞美印度的自然景物和印度的历史上的事迹不了解，鲁迅先生认为这是当时在英国帝国主义者的统治下，不便明白直说，泰戈尔先生是在竭力唤醒同胞起来革命的。沈纳兰君说是关于这事，他在北京也已听到了一点。
    从沈纳兰君多方提出关于鲁迅先生的问题，可见他对于鲁迅先生已经有了深度的研究。他不但熟悉鲁迅先生的作品，为着探究作品的时代背景，他也懂得了我国许多近代的历史。同在亚洲，同被帝国主义者侵略过的，过去惨痛的事迹，原是容易了解的吧。真是一见如故，当我送他出门的时候，我觉得他原是知己的亲友。
    记得前年8月间，印度文化代表团来到杭州时，适值钱达团长的生日，我们就给他做生日，他说他这生日同在家里过得一样愉快；几位女代表弄糕点给我们吃，也好像原是亲姊妹的。灵隐石碑上的一行缅甸文，由于钱达团长的翻译，才知道这意思是“莲花中有一块玉”。在灵隐，不但释迦牟尼佛等塑像，许多石壁上的雕刻，也都是充满印度风味的。每次看到印度影片和印度的艺术表现，我总觉得原是熟悉的。真的，自从玄奘法师西游以来，我国同印度的文化交流已有一千三百多年的历史。正如钱达团长说的，“我们是邻居，是好朋友”。最近印度共和国副总统萨瓦帕利·拉达克里希南先生来到我国，无疑的，中印两国的友谊将更加深厚。我们中印两国的友谊，实在是又深又远的了！
