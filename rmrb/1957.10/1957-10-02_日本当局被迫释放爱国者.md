    Japanese Authorities Forced to Release Patriots
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Under strong protest from the Japanese public, all twenty-five patriotic workers and students arrested by the Tokyo police authorities have been released by the afternoon of the 29th.
    The arrested workers and students had supported the people of Sunagawa-cho, Japan, in their struggle against the expansion of the U.S. Tachikawa Air Base. This act of suppression by the Japanese government had aroused strong protests from the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan ("Sōhyō"), the All-Japan Federation of Student Associations ("Zengakuren"), the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Japanese public.

    日本当局被迫释放爱国者
    据新华社30日讯  在日本公众强烈抗议下，被东京警察当局逮捕的二十五名爱国工人和学生到29日下午为止，已经全部陆续获释。
    这次被逮捕的工人和学生们曾经支持日本砂川町人民反对扩大美国立川空军基地的斗争。日本政府的这一镇压行动曾经激起了日本“总评”、“全学联”、共产党、社会党和日本公众的强烈抗议。
