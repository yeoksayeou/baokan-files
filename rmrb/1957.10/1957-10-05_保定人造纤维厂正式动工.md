    Baoding Artificial Fiber Factory Officially Starts Construction
    A modern factory manufacturing chemical viscose fiber (i.e., rayon) – the state-owned Baoding Artificial Fiber Factory – officially broke ground on September 28th.
    After the completion of the first phase of the factory, it will be able to produce 5,000 tons of ordinary rayon annually. After the completion of the second phase, it will be able to produce 5,000 tons of high-tenacity rayon and 830,000 sets of automobile tire cord fabric annually.
    The ordinary rayon and high-tenacity rayon produced by this factory will be made from Northeast-produced white pine and North China-produced cotton linter through chemical processing. Ordinary rayon has a brighter luster than natural silk. When mixed with natural silk to weave silk fabrics, it can compensate for the dull luster and difficulty in dyeing of natural silk, and is strong and durable. The automobile tire cord fabric woven from high-tenacity rayon has a stronger heat dissipation and more than twice the wear resistance than the automobile tire cord fabric currently woven from cotton in our country.
    This artificial fiber factory was designed with the assistance of the German Democratic Republic, and the complete set of machinery and equipment will also be supplied by them. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    保定人造纤维厂正式动工
    一座制造化学粘胶纤维（即人造丝）的现代化工厂——国营保定人造纤维厂9月28日正式动工兴建。
    这个厂第一期工程完工后，每年能生产五千吨普通人造丝；第二期工程完工后，每年能生产五千吨人造强力丝和八十三万套汽车轮胎帘子布。
    这个工厂出产的普通人造丝、人造强力丝，将用东北出产的鱼鳞松和华北地区出产的棉子短绒经过化学处理方法制成。人造普通丝比天然蚕丝光泽鲜艳，同天然蚕丝混合织成丝绸，能够弥补天然蚕丝光泽暗淡，不易染色的缺点，而且坚固耐用。人造强力丝织的汽车轮胎帘子布比现在我国用棉花织的汽车轮胎帘子布散温力强、耐磨力高一倍以上。
    这座人造纤维厂是民主德国帮助我国设计的，全套机械设备也将由他们供应。　（据新华社讯）
