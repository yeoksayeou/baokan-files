    To Persuade, Not to Coerce
    Xing Huan
    Recently, in the socialist debate in rural areas, a situation has emerged: some places have not fully aired views or have not done a good job of preparation, and have rushed into the great debate. Therefore, in the debate, they cannot persuade the well-to-do middle peasants with erroneous words and deeds based on reason, but can only use pressure to try to make them submit. The situation of the great debate in Dengta Township, Heyuan County, published in this newspaper today is like this. This approach makes it difficult to truly improve the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses through debate, and to clarify major issues of right and wrong; it is also difficult to educate and unite the well-to-do middle peasants to take the socialist road through debate.
    In the socialist debate in rural areas, the capitalist ideas of some well-to-do middle peasants should of course be criticized, and their erroneous remarks about their dissatisfaction with unified purchase and marketing and cooperativization must also be refuted. However, we must never adopt simple and crude methods or be impatient in dealing with well-to-do middle peasants, because empty reasoning and labeling cannot solve complex ideological problems. Organizing a great debate is an arduous and meticulous task, and we must adopt the method of calmly presenting the facts and reasoning.
    Why present the facts? Because socialist facts are the most persuasive and can best demonstrate the superiority of socialism. Whether it is cooperativization or unified purchase and marketing, the facts are "very good," and the so-called "cooperation is not as good as individual farming" and "unified purchase and marketing have messed things up" cannot stand comparison. Why reason? Because socialist principles are open and aboveboard, are irrefutable truths, while the capitalist principles held by some well-to-do middle peasants are selfish and distorted, and cannot compete with socialist principles. Peasants are the most realistic. It is not easy to make them believe by only reasoning without presenting the facts, and it is impossible to raise their socialist consciousness by only presenting the facts without reasoning. Therefore, the facts must be presented sufficiently, the principles must be explained thoroughly, and work must be done in light of their different situations in order to thoroughly refute fallacies and convince the well-to-do middle peasants.
    Dong Tianfu, a well-to-do middle peasant of the Miaopu No. 2 Cooperative in Nanzhang County, Hubei Province, still insisted after everyone reasoned with him and calculated accounts at the debate meeting, saying "Unified purchase and marketing leave little grain, life is hard" and "The cooperative is not as good as individual farming, the crops of the cooperative are not as well grown as before liberation." In order to refute these fallacies, the cooperative organized him and everyone to visit the field production and life comparison exhibition. For example, he said that there was little grain left and life was hard, so the members asked him to compare the year 1948, when his family used the most grain, with the present. In that year, his family spent a total of 5,209 catties of grain, an average of 877 catties per person, but after deducting miscellaneous expenses such as giving gifts to the township chief, hiring short-term workers, and making clothes, the actual grain consumption per person was still 13 catties less than the 525 catties in 1956. For example, he said that the cooperative was not as good as individual farming households, so the members calculated that he originally had eight mu of land, and before liberation, he only harvested one season a year, with a yield of 630 catties per mu. After cooperativization, it was changed to two seasons, and this year the total yield was more than 860 catties per mu. Compare the harvest of the individual farming well-to-do middle peasant Dong Guanglu and the cooperative: for paddy fields of the same soil quality, the cooperative harvested three shi of grain per mu, while Dong only harvested two shi; the cooperative's cotton generally had more than 60 peaches per plant, while Dong's only had more than 30; Dong's family's average income this year was 50 yuan per person, while the average income of Li Changqing, a middle peasant member with the same labor force as him, was 80 yuan per person. In the face of these ironclad facts, Dong Tianfu nodded and admitted defeat and no longer insisted on his wrong opinions.
    In the great debate, pressure cannot be applied to certain well-to-do middle peasants with erroneous words and deeds for another reason. That is: well-to-do middle peasants, although some of them have quite serious capitalist ideas or have certain anti-socialist words and deeds, are still working people, a class of peasants. Therefore, we can only adopt the method of starting from the desire for unity, reaching unity on a new basis through criticism, and not the method of dealing with landlords and rich peasants. The method of unity-criticism-unity is also the method of presenting facts, reasoning, and convincing people with reason.

    要说服不要压服
    星环
    最近，在农村的社会主义大辩论中，出现了这样一种情况：有的地方没有鸣深放透，或者是没有做好准备工作，就匆匆忙忙地转入大辩论。因此，辩论时就不能做到据理说服有错误言行的富裕中农，只能借用压力企图使他们服输。今天本报发表的河源县灯塔乡大辩论的情况就是如此。这种做法，是难于真正通过辩论提高干部和群众的社会主义觉悟，弄清大是大非的；也难于通过辩论教育和团结富裕中农走社会主义道路。
    在农村的社会主义大辩论中，对于某些富裕中农的资本主义思想，当然应该批判，对于他们不满意统购统销和合作化的错误言论，也必须驳斥。但是，对待富裕中农，决不能采用简单粗暴的方法，急躁从事，因为光凭空洞的道理和扣帽子，是不能解决复杂的思想问题的。组织大辩论是一件艰苦细致的工作，必须采取平心静气地摆事实、讲道理的方法。
    为什么要摆事实？因为社会主义的事实是最有说服力的，最能显示社会主义优越性的，无论是合作化也好，统购统销也好，事实都是“好得很”，而所谓“合作不如单干”“统购统销搞糟了”的说法是经不起对照的。为什么要讲道理？因为社会主义的道理是光明磊落的大道理，是推不翻、驳不倒的真理，而某些富裕中农所持的资本主义的道理，却是自私自利的歪道理，是无法和社会主义的道理相抗衡的。农民是最现实的，光讲道理不摆事实，就不易使他们相信，而光摆事实不讲道理，又不能提高他们的社会主义觉悟。因此，必须把事实摆得充分，必须把道理讲得透彻，而且还要针对他们不同的情况做工作，才能彻底驳倒谬论，使富裕中农口服心服。
    湖北南漳县苗圃二社富裕中农董天福，虽然经过大家在辩论会上和他说理算账，仍然坚持说“统购统销留粮少，生活过苦了”“合作社没有单干好，合作社的庄稼没有解放前种得好”。为了驳倒他的这些谬论，社里又组织他和大家参观了田间生产和生活对比展览会。比如他说留粮少生活苦，社员们就让他挑他家用粮最多的1948年来和现在比。那一年他全家共开支粮食五千二百零九斤，每人平均八百七十七斤，但除去给乡保长送人情、请短工、做衣服等杂项花消外，每人实际用粮比1956年的五百二十五斤还少十三斤。又如他说合作社不如单干户，社员们就算了一下他原来有八亩田，解放前一年只收一季，每亩产六百三十斤，合作化后改成两季，今年每亩一共收了八百六十多斤。再比比单干户富裕中农董光禄和合作社的收成：同等土质的水田，社里每亩收三石谷，董只收二石；社里每棵棉花一般六十多个桃，董的只有三十多个；董家今年每人平均收入五十元，而和他有同等劳力的中农社员李昌清一家每人平均收入八十元。在这些铁的事实面前，董天福点头认输不再坚持自己的错误意见了。
    在大辩论中，对待某些有错误言行的富裕中农不能施用压力，还有着另一方面的原因。这就是：富裕中农，尽管其中有些人的资本主义思想相当严重或者有某些反社会主义的言行，但仍然是劳动人民，是农民中的一个阶层。因此，对待他们只能采取从团结的愿望出发，经过批评，在新的基础上达到团结的方法，而不能采取对待地主、富农的办法。团结——批评——团结的方法，也就是摆事实、讲道理，以理服人的方法。
