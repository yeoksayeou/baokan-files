    Water Kettle That Whistles When Water Boils
    Shanghai has recently successfully trial-produced an aluminum kettle that whistles when the water boils. This kettle has no lid, and both filling and pouring water are done through the same spout, which has a whistle tightly pressed onto the opening with a spring. When the water boils in the kettle, steam comes out, and the whistle will sound from low to high. When the water is completely boiled, the sound is loud enough to be heard in the next room. People will hear it and take it off the stove, preventing excessive coal burning because they didn't know it had boiled.
    This kettle was imitated from a foreign product by the Shanghai Joint State-Private Yitai Aluminum Products Factory and will be mass-produced starting next year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    水开了会叫的水壶
    上海最近试制成功了一种水烧开了会叫的铝制水壶。这种水壶没有盖子，进水、倒水都是一个壶嘴，嘴口上有一个叫笛，用弹簧紧紧地压在上面。壶里水烧开，水蒸气喷出来，叫笛就会由低到高地叫起来。水完全烧开，叫的声音响得隔壁屋子都听得见，人听见以后就去拿开，不会因为不知道烧开而多烧煤。
    这种水壶是上海公私合营益泰铝器厂根据外国产品仿制的，明年开始大量生产。（据新华社讯）
