China and Russia, two large neighboring countries, shared many similarities or resemblances before the October Revolution. Both were oppressed by feudalism, and economically and culturally backward, with China being even more so. The working people urgently demanded liberation, the peasants desperately wanted land, and advanced individuals thirsted for the truth of saving the nation and its people. When the Chinese began to learn from the West, they did not pay much attention to this backward empire. However, since the beginning of the 20th century, as Russia became the center of the world revolutionary movement, the Chinese became increasingly interested in Russia's revolutionary movement and progressive social ideas. The 1905 Revolution had inspired the Chinese bourgeois revolutionaries led by Sun Yat-sen, and the February Revolution of 1917 caused a strong reaction among Chinese democrats; Populist intellectuals also became objects of worship and imitation for Chinese revolutionaries. Before the October Revolution, Chinese revolutionaries had learned many positive things from the Russian revolutionary movement, but all this did not go beyond the scope of the old bourgeois democracy. Only the victory of the October Revolution pointed out the correct direction for the Chinese people who were wandering and searching for a way out in the dark, fundamentally changing the path of the Chinese revolution.

Upon hearing the news of the October Revolution, people from all walks of life in China expressed a mixture of surprise and excitement. Chinese intellectuals had witnessed the sharp and complex class struggle situation in Russia after the February Revolution, but they could not understand that this struggle was essentially a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership, a struggle between socialism and capitalism. Therefore, they could not help but feel sudden surprise when they saw the working class, which they were not familiar with and had always looked down upon, becoming masters of the country in such a large nation. On November 10, 1917, the third day after the outbreak of the revolution, Shanghai's "Minguo Daily" reported the news of the "Sudden Russian Coup" and "The Overthrow of the Provisional Government" with large headlines, stating that "the Petrograd garrison and labor society had overthrown the Kerensky government" and that "the Makechime Party (referring to the Bolshevik Party) had occupied the capital," and pointed out that "the mastermind was Mr. Rilin (referring to Lenin)." On the 11th, the Shibao, Shenbao, and Chenzhongbao also reported and introduced the event. The "Pacific" magazine, Volume 1, Number 8, published on November 15, was the first periodical to reflect the October Revolution. Later, Volume 1, Number 2, of the "Labor" magazine, in an article titled "A Brief Biography of Li Ning, the Vanguard of the Russian Social Revolution," said: "Now our neighbor, Russia, has openly and justly embarked on a social revolution where the rich and the poor are treated equally. Everyone thinks the term 'social revolution' is terrible, but it is actually just the natural trend of the world. The reasons for the evils of society now will be discovered everywhere in the future, which is not surprising." Although these reports and introductions inevitably contained errors and distortions, and some even mixed in slander and hostility, one point was factual and deeply rooted in people's hearts: in Russia, the working class and soldiers, mainly from peasant backgrounds, had seized power. Not only the bourgeoisie and intellectuals knew this, but also illiterate or semi-literate workers heard about it and were encouraged. Therefore, the initial impression the October Revolution gave to the Chinese people was: it was different from any revolution in history, and the working people, led by the working class, were the protagonists of this revolution. The socialist essence of the October Revolution was vaguely felt.

What exactly did such a new type of regime oppose and advocate? This was of great concern to both those who were hostile to it and those who sympathized with it. The initial reports also mentioned roughly some of the policies and measures of the Soviets, such as demanding peace, distributing land to peasants, implementing universal suffrage, and workers supervising enterprises, etc. The Shibao on November 11 stated: "The Military and Industrial Representatives Conference is currently planning the following matters: (1) Immediately create a democratic peace; (2) Distribute the land of the landlords to the peasants; (3) Hand over all administrative power to the Military and Industrial Representatives Conference; (4) Convene a fair and popularly elected National Assembly." The Oriental Magazine, Volume 15, Number 3, in its first introduction to Lenin's deeds, said that he "excluded biased middle-class and compromising party strategies, and advocated the most radical pure socialism," and said that after the revolution was completed, he organized a "labor-soldier government," "which on the first day issued a declaration of peaceful and rapid completion, and on the second day issued a declaration of land requisition, and the labor's right to supervise industry and the right to an eight-hour workday were subsequently established." The peasants' centuries-old desire for land was satisfied, and the universal suffrage and eight-hour work system that workers in advanced European countries had been striving for for decades were realized in just a few days, and the workers were transformed from wage slaves into masters who "supervised enterprises." How terrible this was in the eyes of bureaucrats, landlords, and capitalists, and how gratifying it was in the eyes of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals! Therefore, the "Labor" magazine published the following words: "The world's astonishing European war has been fought for several years. Russia's astonishing revolution has also caused a sensation. People all over the world are paying attention and caring about it, inquiring about its news, and studying its results. Officials and bureaucrats are afraid that their troubles will escalate and they will not be able to protect their own interests and positions; big landlords and big capitalists are also afraid that their troubles will escalate and the communist world will be implemented once and for all, turning their privately owned property obtained through fraud and exploitation into nothing. Therefore, they are all trembling with fear, but the general trend is irresistible. Only those unfortunate laborers are looking forward to their revolution, hoping that it will succeed and spread as soon as possible, so that the masses can share equal happiness and live free lives together. Therefore, telegrams from Russia are particularly attention-grabbing, and news from the extremist party is particularly welcome." Therefore, the second strong impression the October Revolution gave to the Chinese people was: the regime established after the revolution opposed capitalists and landlords and gave the working people means of production and democratic rights.

Of course, the effects of some of the Soviet Union's domestic policies could not be seen immediately, but its foreign policy was easily felt deeply by those who were subjected to it. Precisely because of this, the Soviet Union's peaceful and friendly foreign policy was quickly welcomed by the broad masses of the Chinese people. For nearly a hundred years, China had been beaten by imperialism, and had never established truly equal and mutually respectful international relations. After the establishment of the Soviet government, on the one hand, it declared that "all nations within the borders of Russia shall have complete autonomy and independence" ("Oriental Magazine" Volume 15, Number 3), and on the other hand, it issued a declaration: "All international treaties concluded by previous governments shall be invalidated after the end of January 1918." ("Shenbao", February 15, 1918) This news greatly inspired the Chinese people. The "Minguo Daily" commentary on May 27, 1918, stated: "The Russian new government is only concerned with eliminating the monopoly of capitalists and the violence of officials. As for the issue of dependent territories... it vigorously opposes the oppressive policies of the previous autocratic government and strives to make the people all ascend to a happy land. Regarding neighboring countries, it is deeply dissatisfied with Japan's aggressive policy... and deeply regrets the autocratic officials' oppression of civilians in China and gives appropriate advice," "It can be seen that it is implementing a democratic policy, and there is no aggression mixed in it." At that time, this point had the widest and deepest impact on people. Even the bourgeoisie who opposed "communism" were very interested. Especially compared with the aggressive policy of Japanese imperialism, the Chinese people felt that no matter what socialism was about, it was always good that the Soviet Union declared that it would not invade China. When the Duan Qirui traitorous government signed the anti-Soviet and anti-communist "China-Japan Joint Army Anti-Enemy Military Agreement" with Japanese imperialism in May 1918, despite the opposition of the people, students from Peking University and other specialized schools went to the traitorous government to petition, expressing their opposition. Chinese students who had returned from studying in Japan even submitted a letter stating: "Japan has long harbored intentions to plot against us, but if there is an opportunity, it will indulge its ambitions. The conditions for sending troops this time are just an excuse, but in reality, there is no need to send troops today." Because the new Russian government "has already declared that it will never infringe upon other countries, and what it advocates is only the implementation of its communism" ("Beijing Daily", May 24, 1918: "Business and Academic Circles and Sino-Japanese Negotiations"). This shows how deeply touching the Soviet Union's foreign policy was. The Soviet Union's foreign policy of peace and friendship gave the Chinese people a third profound impression: the Soviet Union advocates peace and opposes aggression.

The above-mentioned superficial understanding of the Russian Revolution constituted the content of the concept of "Russian-style revolution" at that time, which was relative to the typical bourgeois revolution of the "French-style." The Chinese people recognized from their vague feelings that the October Revolution was the first proletarian revolution in human history, a revolution of the socialist type. Therefore, the belief in the French-style revolution encountered a challenge from the new type of revolutionary concept, and its prestige among Chinese advanced people began to fundamentally shake.

To understand the impact of the October Revolution on China, it is also necessary to estimate the impact of the chain reaction caused by the Russian Revolution. Turning to the newspapers of 1918 and 1919, it can be seen that a large amount of space was devoted to reporting and introducing the revolutions in Germany and Hungary, the strikes in Britain, France, the United States, and Japan, and the national independence movements in colonies such as Ireland, the Philippines, India, Egypt, and Korea. This high tide of world revolution showed the Chinese people the decline of capitalism and the rise of socialism, as well as the upsurge of national independence movements, which naturally deepened the impact of the October Revolution. Some people may have underestimated the significance of the Russian Revolution, but when they saw the successive German and Hungarian revolutions, they no longer doubted the power of the socialist revolution. Especially the revolutionary movements in the colonies were very close to the Chinese people. All these Eastern and Western revolutionary movements should also be regarded as the indirect impact of the October Revolution. At that time, everyone who cared about current affairs felt that the waves of this world revolutionary upsurge were increasingly approaching the coast of China.

Under the impact of the world revolutionary wave, China's reactionaries were frightened and panicked, and from 1918 onwards, they repeatedly ordered the investigation and prohibition of "extremist parties" based on groundless rumors, slandered the so-called "extremism" as "communism and communal wives," constantly sealed up progressive publications, were hostile to the Soviet regime, and even willingly acted as Japanese imperialism's anti-Soviet watchdogs. These actions of theirs were condemned and spurned by the Chinese people. The bourgeois reformists had an instinctive fear of socialism. Although some of them, due to the conflict of interests with Japanese imperialism, advocated maintaining diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and jointly dealing with Japan, they were ideologically hostile to the Soviet Union. Under the stimulation of the world proletarian revolution upsurge, they were forced to study various reform methods to make up for the shortcomings of capitalism in order to preemptively resist the spread of socialism in China. The bourgeois democrats represented by Sun Yat-sen welcomed the October Revolution. They understood and accepted part of the achievements of the October Revolution from the standpoint of democracy and nationalism, and tried to absorb the positive things to promote China's democratic revolution and national independence movement. They had principled differences with the Bolsheviks on the point of implementing socialism, but they understood that the Soviet Union was a good friend of the Chinese people in the struggle against imperialism and feudalism, so their attitude towards the Soviet Union was friendly. In 1918, Sun Yat-sen sent a telegram to the Soviet Union to congratulate it. The Kuomintang's official newspaper, the "Minguo Daily" in Shanghai, also consistently introduced the situation of the Soviet Union with a friendly and sympathetic attitude. The left wing of the bourgeois democrats later adopted the Three Great Policies with the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, which played an active role in the development of the Chinese democratic revolution, but they were not the leading revolutionary force. The impact of the October Revolution on China was mainly reflected in the increased awareness of the working class and the transformation of advanced intellectuals to communism.

Under the influence of the October Revolution, Chinese advanced intellectuals rapidly improved their political understanding. They saw that the October Revolution was a completely new type of revolution, which not only completely eradicated feudalism and overthrew the landlords and capitalists, but also shattered the imperialist shackles imposed on the heads of various ethnic groups in Russia, and established a new ethnic relationship of equality and mutual assistance domestically. They also realized from the October Revolution and the high tide of the world revolutionary movement that the capitalist system was already full of contradictions and was tending towards decline and death, and that it would be replaced by proletarian socialism. The world had entered the era of socialist revolution, and all oppressed nations and exploited classes had to rise up to fight for independence and liberation. This was an irresistible trend of the 20th century. Therefore, Chinese advanced intellectuals represented by Comrade Li Dazhao not only expressed unlimited welcome to the October Revolution, but also quickly accepted Marxism-Leninism, turned from democracy to a communist standpoint, abandoned the illusion of taking the capitalist road, and resolved to take the path of the Russians.

Comrade Li Dazhao's "A Comparative View of the French and Russian Revolutions," published on July 1, 1918, was the first essay by the Chinese people to praise the October Revolution. In this article, he wrote: "The Russian Revolution is the revolution of the early 20th century, a revolution based on socialism," "We can only crane our necks to welcome the dawn of a new civilization in the world for the events in Russia today, and listen carefully to the news of the establishment of a new Russia based on freedom and humanity, and seek to adapt to this new trend in the world." In November of the same year, just as the imperialists and their lackeys were touting and celebrating the victory of the Allied Powers over Germany as the victory of humanity and justice, Li Dazhao published two famous essays, "The Victory of the Common People" and "The Victory of Bolshevism," vigorously praising the October Revolution and enthusiastically hailing the victory of the socialist revolution. Based on the Marxist viewpoint, he correctly analyzed the imperialist nature of the First World War and pointed out the great historical significance of the October Socialist Revolution. He regarded the high tide of world revolution that emerged after the war as a result of the influence of the great October Revolution, an inevitable trend caused by the October Revolution. He declared that the political fate of all capitalist countries would be the same as that of the defeated German imperialism in the First World War, "going to extinction together," and that socialism would inevitably achieve victory throughout the world. He said: "Just look at the future globe, it must be a world of red flags," "the world of labor."

These articles showed the infinite longing and firm belief of Chinese advanced intellectuals in socialism. In this way, under the enlightenment of the October Revolution, the first group of intellectuals in China who approved of the Russian Revolution and advocated taking the path of the Russians with preliminary communist ideas was produced. This was a new, positive, and revolutionary factor in Chinese society.

Under the influence of the October Revolution, the broad masses of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals also raised their awareness, and saw new hope for national liberation from this revolution. The most advanced among them gradually recognized the fundamental difference between socialist Soviet Russia and imperialism from their close experiences, and saw clearly who China's enemies were and who China's true friends were. When the First World War had just ended, the vast majority of Chinese bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals had also held great illusions and hopes about the British, American, and other imperialist countries that had won the war, thinking that "justice can defeat power" and that China could easily recover its lost independence and obtain genuine "national self-determination" from the Paris Peace Conference. However, the actual progress of the Paris Peace Conference quickly shattered all the illusions that people had about imperialism. The ferocious faces of the European and American powers were completely exposed. Not only did they not help China recover its lost rights and interests, but they also attempted to force China to recognize the privileges of Japanese imperialism in Shandong and Qingdao. This aroused great anger among the Chinese people, and thus the "May Fourth" patriotic movement occurred. Completely opposite to imperialism, Soviet Russia expressed deep sympathy and friendship to the Chinese people. On July 25, 1919, the Soviet Russian government issued its first declaration to China, declaring the abolition of all unequal treaties concluded with China during the Tsarist era, renouncing all imperialist privileges in China, and expressing support for the Chinese people's struggle for independence and freedom. This exposed all the slanders of the October Revolution and Soviet Russia by the imperialists and reactionary governments over the years, and made the Chinese people further realize the greatness of Lenin's national policy and the Soviet Russian government's friendship towards China. This declaration was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Chinese people. Dozens of mass organizations of workers, students, and capitalists sent telegrams, and many newspapers, including conservative bourgeois newspapers, published commentaries, thanking and praising this great brotherly assistance of the Soviet Russian people. They praised this as "an unprecedented beauty since the existence of mankind," hailed the Soviet regime as "the pride of justice and humanity," and called "all Russian workers, peasants, and Red Guards" as "the most lovable human beings in the world," "hoping that in the future, the people of China and Russia will work together with perfect friendship in the direction of freedom, equality, and mutual assistance to eliminate international oppression, as well as national, ethnic, and class differences, so as to create a truly equal, free, and fraternal new situation." The workers' organizations were especially elated, expressing their willingness to "join hands with the farmers, workers, and Red Guards of all Russia, stand under the banner of human justice, and work together to eliminate the special class and realize the great harmony of the world." (See the reports in Shibao and Shenbao on April 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, and 19, 1920)

This friendly fact of the Soviet Russian government towards the Chinese people eliminated many people's various doubts and misunderstandings about the October Revolution, and made people recognize that it was not imperialism but socialist Soviet Russia that truly sympathized with and supported the oppressed people, thereby greatly strengthening the Chinese people's will to fight against imperialism and arousing a yearning for socialism. From then on, the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle had true friends and supporters.

The great October Socialist Revolution not only pointed out the correct path of revolution for the Chinese people, strengthened the Chinese people's revolutionary will, but also set an example of practical action for the Chinese people to strive for their own liberation. In China's modern revolutionary struggles, there was a major shortcoming, that is, either the mass revolutionary movement lacked the leadership of advanced elements and advanced ideas, or the revolutionary activities of advanced elements did not rely on and mobilize the broad masses. Therefore, although they all gave the domestic rulers and foreign aggressors more or less of a blow, they did not achieve final victory. Under the influence of the October Revolution, this situation changed. Chinese advanced intellectuals saw the great strength of the workers and peasants from the high tide of the October Revolution and the world revolutionary movement, and gradually realized that to truly change the status quo of China, it was necessary to rely on the broad masses and promote the masses to carry out direct revolutionary struggles. This was already expressed in a series of essays published by Comrade Li Dazhao before the May Fourth Movement. In his article "The Victory of Bolshevism," he explained the great significance of the mass movement, pointing out that all old forces such as warlords, bureaucrats, and nobles would be submerged in the tide of the mass revolutionary movement. In "New Century," published in January 1919, he pointed out that the "working class all over the world must unite" and "overthrow the class of capital all over the world. The general strike is their weapon." "The Life of Workers in Tangshan Coal Plant," published in March of the same year, not only expressed deep sympathy for the working masses, but also indicated that he had paid attention to the Chinese workers' problems. In the article "Youth and the Countryside," Comrade Li Dazhao, on the one hand, expressed great dissatisfaction with the barbaric rule in the Chinese countryside, and at the same time pointed out that to thoroughly change Chinese society, "the knowledge class must be integrated with the labor class," and encouraged young people and intellectuals to learn from the example of Russian youth, to be connected with the workers and peasants, and to "go to the laboring people to propagate the doctrines of humanism and socialism." This tentatively put forward the idea of intellectuals combining with the working people to fight together.

This influence also spread to bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals. In March 1918, a magazine named "Labor" appeared in China for the first time. In Volume 1, Number 1, it proposed to "respect labor, advocate laborism, cultivate the morality of laborers, instill laborers with world knowledge, record the actions of world laborers, so as to clarify the true picture of social problems, and promote the consistent resolution of social problems by Chinese laborers and world laborers." In November 1918, the famous bourgeois democratic educator Cai Yuanpei shouted the slogan "Labor Sacred" in a mass gathering speech. This slogan reflected a new understanding of the working people by Chinese intellectuals under the influence of the high tide of world revolution, so it quickly spread among the broad masses of intellectuals. Of course, before the May Fourth Movement, intellectuals' understanding of "Labor Sacred" was only abstract and vague. The "laborers" they referred to did not strictly refer to the working class, but included intellectuals of all classes. But this slogan showed that even among the Chinese bourgeois intellectuals who were extremely detached from the people and had always held the traditional ideas of "all professions are inferior, only studying is superior" and "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others," some people began to change their views on the laboring people.

Due to the escalating aggression of imperialism and the increasingly frantic betrayal of the Duan Qirui government, this aroused great dissatisfaction among the broad masses of intellectuals and young students. They gradually realized that to save the country from danger, it was not enough to rely on empty talk, but it was necessary to step out of the study and carry out direct revolutionary activities with the masses. Some articles published in "Weekly Review," edited by Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu, showed this understanding. The article "The Transformation of International Society," published in the first issue published at the end of 1918, wrote: "It must be known that the lives of most of our common people can be transformed by ourselves, not by nature or given to us by the aristocracy," "To seek lasting peace in the world and the practical happiness of mankind, we should take action and not be too timid." The article "Eliminating Three Evils," published in January 1919, even more loudly called on the people to rise up to oppose the oppression of warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians.

In this way, under the influence of the great October Revolution, under the impact of the high tide of the proletarian revolutionary movement and the workers' strike movement in various countries, and under the stimulation of the continuous national liberation movements in colonial countries, the consciousness and understanding of the Chinese people, especially the broad masses of young students and intellectuals, were greatly improved, and the revolutionary will to fight for national liberation and freedom was even more strengthened. Therefore, when the news of the humiliating defeat at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 came, the anger in people's hearts that could not be contained erupted like a volcano, setting off the great May Fourth Movement against Japanese imperialism and the traitorous warlord government.

Although there was no Chinese Communist Party during the May Fourth Movement, there were already a large number of intellectuals with preliminary communism who approved of the Russian Revolution. The early stage of the May Fourth Movement was a revolutionary movement of a united front of three parts of people: communist intellectuals, revolutionary petty-bourgeois intellectuals, and bourgeois intellectuals, among which communist intellectuals were the revolutionary leading backbone, and bourgeois intellectuals were its right wing. That is to say, at its beginning, it was only limited to intellectuals. But when it developed to the June 3rd Movement, it was not only intellectuals, but also the broad masses of the proletariat, petty bourgeoisie, and bourgeoisie participated, and it became a nationwide revolutionary movement. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On New Democracy" when analyzing the significance of the May Fourth Revolutionary Movement and its relationship with the October Revolution: The May Fourth Movement was an anti-imperialist movement and an anti-feudal movement. The outstanding historical significance of the May Fourth Movement lies in the fact that it carried an attitude that the Xinhai Revolution did not have, that is, thoroughly uncompromisingly anti-imperialist and thoroughly uncompromisingly anti-feudalist. The May Fourth Movement occurred under the call of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian revolution, and under the call of Lenin. The May Fourth Movement was part of the world proletarian revolution at that time.

The May Fourth Movement can be said to be the first political action of the reaction caused by the October Revolution in China. The great October Socialist Revolution divided the era of the entire world history, and also changed the direction of the development of the Chinese revolution, and the May Fourth Movement became the turning point of China from the old democratic revolution to the new democratic revolution.

    十月革命在中国的反响
    丁守和　殷叙彝　张伯昭
    中国和俄国这两个毗邻的大国，在十月革命以前，很多地方是相同或者近似的。同样受着封建主义的压迫，经济和文化上都很落后，中国则更落后，劳动人民都迫切要求解放，农民迫切要求土地，先进的人们则如饥如渴地追求着救国救民的真理。中国人开始向西方学习的时候，对于这个落后的大帝国是不重视的，但自从二十世纪初，俄国成为世界革命运动的中心以后，中国人对于俄国的革命运动和进步的社会思潮就越来越感到很大的兴趣了。1905年革命曾经鼓舞了以孙中山为首的中国资产阶级革命派，1917年的2月革命在中国的民主主义者中引起过强烈的反应；民粹派的知识分子也成了中国革命家崇拜和模仿的对象。十月革命以前，中国的革命者曾经从俄国的革命运动中学到了不少积极的东西，但是这一切都没有超出旧的资产阶级民主主义的范围，只有十月革命的胜利，才给在黑暗中彷徨探索寻找出路的中国人民指出了正确的方向，从根本上改变了中国革命的道路。
    在听到十月革命的消息后，中国各阶层的人民表现了惊喜交集的兴奋心情。二月革命以后，俄国国内的尖锐复杂的阶级斗争形势，中国的知识分子是看到的，但是还不能理解这个斗争在本质上是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺领导权的斗争、是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，因此一旦看到自己并不熟悉而且素来就轻视的工人阶级在这样一个大国里当家作主，不能不感到突然和惊奇。1917年11月10日即革命爆发后的第三天，上海的“民国日报”就以“突如其来的俄国大政变”、“临时政府已推翻”的大字标题，报道了“彼得格勒戍军与劳动社会已推倒克伦斯基政府”，“美克齐美党（按即指布尔什维克党）占据都城”的消息，并指出“主谋者为里林氏（即指列宁）”。11日，该报及时报、申报、晨钟报也都作了报道和介绍。11月15日出版的“太平洋”杂志一卷八号是第一个反映十月革命的期刊。稍后些时间，一卷二号的“劳动”杂志在“俄罗斯社会革命之先锋李宁事略”一文中说：“现在我们中国的毗邻俄国，已经光明正大的做起贫富一班齐的社会革命来了。社会革命四个字，人人以为可怕，其实不过是世界的自然趋势。现在社会不善的原因，以后处处皆要发现的，毫不稀奇。”尽管这些报道和介绍中难免有讹传和歪曲之处，有的甚至还夹杂着诬蔑和敌视，但有一点是符合事实而且深入人心的：在俄国，工人阶级和主要是出身于农民的士兵掌握了政权。不但资产阶级和知识分子知道这一点，就是不识字或识字不多的工人劳动者也听到了并且受到了鼓舞。因此，十月革命给中国人民最初的印象是：它和历史上任何一次革命都不同，以工人阶级为首的劳动人民是这次革命的主角。十月革命的社会主义本质，已经被模糊地感觉到了。
    这样一个新型的政权究竟反对什么，主张什么？这是无论敌视它的或同情它的人都非常关心的。在初期的报道中也大致说到了苏维埃的一些政策和措施，如要求和平、分配土地给农民、实行普选、工人监督企业等等。11月11日的时报说：“军工代表会现计划以下数事：（一）即行造成民治的和局，（二）即以产主之土地分给农民，（三）以行政全权交与军工代表会，（四）召集公正民选国会”。东方杂志十五卷三号在第一次介绍列宁的事迹时说他“排斥偏倾中产及妥协党略，而唱道最激烈之纯粹社会主义”，说他在革命告成后组织了“劳兵政府”，“第一日即发表平和速成之宣言，第二日发表土地收用之宣言，而劳动家监督工业权及每日八小时劳动权，乃继之而设定。”农民千百年来对于土地的渴望满足了，欧洲先进国家工人几十年来为之奋斗的普选权和八小时工作制在短短几天内就实现了，工人由雇佣奴隶变成了“监督企业”的主人，这在官僚、地主和资本家看来是多么可怕，而在工人、农民和革命的知识分子看来又是多么可喜的事呵！因此“劳动”杂志上就登载过这样的话：“世界惊人的欧战，已打了好几年。俄罗斯惊人的革命，也闹得轰天震地。世界人士莫不瞩目关心，打听他的消息，研究他的结果。做官做宦的，恐怕他们乱子闹大了，把自己的利禄势位也保不住；大地主大富翁，又恐怕他们乱子闹大了，共产世界一旦实行，把自己欺诈剥夺所得的私产，化为乌有。所以都是栗栗危惧，然又大势所趋，莫可如何。只有那些不幸的劳动家，天天盼望他们的革命，早早成功，早早普及，好大众共享平等的幸福，同过自由的日子。所以俄罗斯来的电报，是格外得人注意，过激党传的消息，格外得人欢迎。”因此，十月革命给中国人的第二个强烈的印象就是：革命后建立的政权，反对资本家和地主，给了劳动人民以生产资料和民主权利。
    当然，苏俄的一些内政措施的效果，不是一时就能看出的，但它的对外政策，却很容易使身受者有深切的体会。正因如此，苏俄的和平友好的外交政策很快就受到广大中国人民的欢迎。近百年来，中国是一向挨帝国主义打的，从来没有建立起真正平等和互相尊重主权的国际关系。苏维埃政府成立后，一方面声明“凡在俄国国境以内之诸民族，皆得完全自治独立”（“东方杂志”十五卷三号）一方面发表宣言：“凡以前之政府缔结之一切国际条约，限于1918年1月末以后概行作废。”（“申报”，1918年2月15日）这些消息大大地振奋了中国人民。1918年5月27日“民国日报”的评论说：“俄国新政府所注意者，惟在排除资本家之垄断与官吏之强暴而已。至属地问题则……力反前专制政府压迫之政策，务使人民悉登乐土。对于邻邦则深不满意于日本之侵略政策……于中国则深憾专制官吏压制平民而施以相当之忠告”，“可见它施行的是民主政策，决无侵略主义参杂于其间。”当时这一点对人们的影响是最广最深的，即使是反对“共产”的资产阶级也很感兴趣。特别是和日帝国主义的侵略政策比起来，中国人民觉得，不管社会主义是怎么一回事，反正苏俄宣布不侵略中国，这总是好的。当1918年5月段祺瑞卖国政府不顾人民的反对，悍然与日本帝国主义签订反苏反共的“中日陆军共同防敌军事协定”的时候，北京大学及其他专门学校的学生就到卖国政府去请愿，表示反对。从日本罢学回国的中国留日学生并且上书说：“查日人蓄意谋我已久，但有机会，即逞野心，此次出兵条件，不过借题发挥，实则今日无出兵之必要。”因为俄国新政府“早已宣言，绝不侵害他国，所主张者，不过实行其共产主义”（1918年5月24日“北京日报”：“学商界与中日交涉”）。由此可见苏俄外交政策感人之深了。苏俄的对外和平友好的政策，使中国人民对十月革命产生了第三个深刻的印象：苏联是主张和平，反对侵略的。
    上述对于俄国革命的粗浅了解，构成了当时所说的“俄国式革命”这一概念的内容，这是和“法国式”的典型资产阶级革命相对而言的。中国人民从模糊的感觉中认识了十月革命是人类历史上破天荒第一次的无产阶级革命，是社会主义类型的革命。因此，法国式革命的信念遇到了新型的革命概念的挑战，它在中国先进人士中间的威信开始根本动摇了。
    要了解十月革命对于中国的影响，同时还必需把俄国革命所引起的连锁反应的影响估计在内。翻开1918、1919两年的报纸，可以看到每天都有很大的篇幅报道和介绍德、匈两国的革命，英、法、美、日等国的罢工和爱尔兰、菲律宾、印度、埃及、朝鲜等殖民地的民族独立运动。这一个世界革命高潮，向中国人民显示了资本主义的衰亡和社会主义的兴起及民族独立运动的高涨，自然也就加深了十月革命的影响。有些人对于俄国革命的意义可能估计不足，但看到了接二连三的德国革命、匈牙利革命，就不再怀疑社会主义革命的力量了。尤其是殖民地的革命运动，对于中国人民是非常亲切的。所有这些东方和西方的革命运动对中国的影响也应当看做十月革命的间接影响。当时一切关心时事的人都感到这个世界革命高潮的浪头已越来越迫近中国的海岸了。
    在世界革命浪潮的冲击下，中国的反动派心惊胆战，草木皆兵，从1918年起就一再捕风捉影地下令查禁“过激党”，诬蔑所谓“过激主义”为“共产公妻”，不断查封进步书刊，敌视苏维埃政权，甚至甘心做日帝国主义反苏的警犬，他们的这些行动是受到中国人民的谴责和唾弃的。资产阶级改良派对社会主义有着本能的恐惧，虽然他们中有些人由于和日帝国主义的利害冲突，主张和苏俄维持外交关系并且协力对付日本，但是在意识形态方面和苏俄是敌对的、在世界无产阶级革命高潮的刺激下，他们被迫研究种种弥补资本主义缺陷的改良办法，来预先抵制社会主义在中国的传播。以孙中山为代表的资产阶级民主派则是欢迎十月革命的，他们从民主主义和民族主义的立场来领会和接受十月革命的一部分成就，尽量吸取积极的东西来推动中国的民主革命和民族独立运动，他们在实行社会主义这一点上和布尔什维克有原则分歧，但是他们懂得苏俄是中国人民在反帝反封建斗争中的好朋友，因此对待苏俄的态度是友善的。在1918年，孙中山就拍了电报给苏俄祝贺，在孙中山指导下的国民党机关报——上海“民国日报”也一直以友好同情的态度介绍苏俄的情况。资产阶级民主派的左翼后来在苏俄和中国共产党的帮助下采取了三大政策，对中国民主革命的开展起了积极的作用，但是他们不是革命的领导力量。十月革命对中国的影响，主要是表现在工人阶级觉悟的提高和先进知识分子向共产主义的转变上。
    在十月革命的影响下，中国的先进知识分子迅速地提高了自己的政治认识。他们看到十月革命是完全新型的革命，它不但彻底铲除了封建主义，打倒了地主资本家，而且打碎了套在俄国各民族头上的帝国主义枷锁，在国内建立了平等、互助的新的民族关系。他们也从十月革命和世界革命运动高潮中认识到，资本主义制度已经矛盾百出，已经趋向没落和死亡，代替它的是无产阶级的社会主义，世界已经进入了社会主义革命的时代，一切被压迫的民族和被剥削的阶级都要起来争取独立和解放，这是二十世纪不可抗拒的潮流。因此，以李大钊同志为代表的中国先进知识分子不但对十月革命表现了无限的欢迎，而且迅速地接受了马克思列宁主义，由民主主义转向了共产主义立场，抛弃了走资本主义道路的幻想，而决心走俄国人的路。
    李大钊同志在1918年7月1日发表的“法俄革命之比较观”，是中国人民歌颂十月革命的第一篇论文。他在这篇文章中写道：“俄罗斯之革命，是二十世纪初期之革命，是立于社会主义上之革命”，“吾人对于俄罗斯今日之事变，惟有翘首以迎其世界的新文明之曙光，倾耳以迎其建立于自由人道上之新俄罗斯之消息，而求所以适应此世界的新潮流。”在同年11月，正当帝国主义及其走狗把协约国对德国的胜利当作人道和公理的胜利来大肆宣扬和庆祝的时候，李大钊又发表了“庶民的胜利”和“布尔什维主义的胜利”这两篇著名的论文，竭力赞扬十月革命，热烈欢呼社会主义革命的胜利。他根据马克思主义的观点，正确地分析了第一次世界大战的帝国主义性质，指出了十月社会主义革命的伟大历史意义。他把战后出现的世界革命的高潮，看作是伟大十月革命影响的结果，是十月革命所引起的必然趋势。他宣称，一切资本主义国家的政治命运将和第一次世界大战中失败了的德国帝国主义一样“同归消亡”，而社会主义必然要在全世界取得胜利。他说：“试看将来的环球，必是赤旗的世界”，“劳工的世界”。
    这些文章表明了中国先进知识分子对社会主义的无限向往和坚定信念。这样，在十月革命的启示下，中国就产生了第一批赞成俄国革命和主张走俄国人道路的具有初步共产主义思想的知识分子。这是中国社会的新的积极的革命因素。
    在十月革命的影响下广大的资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子也提高了认识，从这个革命中看到了民族解放的新希望。他们中最先进的部分从亲切的体验中，逐步认识了社会主义的苏俄和帝国主义的根本区别，看清了谁是中国的敌人，谁是中国的真正朋友。第一次世界大战刚刚结束时，中国的资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子的绝大多数也曾对在战争中取得胜利的英美等帝国主义抱着很大的幻想和希望，以为真的可以“公理战胜强权”，中国可以轻而易举地从巴黎和会上挽回已丧失的独立地位，获得真正的“民族自决”。然而，巴黎和会的实际进程很快地粉碎了人们对帝国主义所抱的一切幻想，欧美列强的狰狞面目完全暴露了，他们不但没有帮助中国收回失去的权益，而且企图强迫中国承认日本帝国主义所夺去的山东和青岛的特权。这就引起了中国人民的极大愤怒，于是发生了“五四”爱国运动。同帝国主义完全相反，苏维埃俄国对中国人民表示了深切的同情和友谊。1919年7月25日，苏俄政府发表了第一次对华宣言，声明废除帝俄时代同中国订立的一切不平等条约，放弃在中国所有的帝国主义特权，并表示支持中国人民争取独立自由的斗争。这就揭穿了几年来帝国主义和反动政府对十月革命和苏俄的一切诬蔑，使中国人民进一步地认识到列宁的民族政策的伟大和苏俄政府对中国的友谊。这个宣言受到了中国广大人民的热烈欢迎。工人、学生、资本家各阶层的数十个民众团体纷纷致电、许多报纸包括保守的资产阶级报纸都发表评论，感谢和歌颂苏俄人民的这种伟大的兄弟般的援助。称赞这是“自有人类以来空前的美举”，欢呼苏维埃政权是“正义人道之骄子”，“全俄的工人农民和红卫兵”是“世界上最可爱的人类”，“希望今后中俄两国人民在自由、平等、互助的正义方面，以美满的友谊戮力于芟除国际的压迫，以及国家的种族的阶级的差别，俾造成一个真正平等、自由、博爱的新局面。”而工人团体则尤其欢欣鼓舞，表示愿与“全俄的农民工人红卫兵提携，立在那人道正义的旗帜下面，一齐努力，除那特殊的阶级，实现那世界的大同。”（见1920年4月6日、9日、12日、15日、17日、19日时报、申报的报道）
    苏俄政府对中国人民的这种友好的事实，消除了许多人对十月革命的种种怀疑和误解，使人们认清了，真正同情和支持被压迫人民的不是帝国主义而是社会主义的苏俄，从而大大地增强了中国人民反对帝国主义的斗争意志，引起了对社会主义的向往。中国人民的革命斗争从此有了真正的朋友和支援者。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命不但给中国人民指出了革命的正确道路，加强了中国人民的革命意志，而且给中国人民作出了争取自身解放的实际行动的榜样。在中国近代的革命斗争中都有一个重大缺点，就是或者群众性的革命运动缺乏先进分子和先进思想的领导，或者先进分子的革命活动没有依靠和发动广大的群众力量，因此虽然都或多或少地给了国内统治者和国外侵略者以打击，但并没有获得最终的胜利。在十月革命的影响下，这种情形发生了变化，中国先进知识分子从十月革命和世界革命运动的高潮中，看到了工农劳动群众的伟大力量，从而逐渐认识到要真正改变中国的现状，就必须依靠广大群众，推动群众去进行直接的革命斗争。这在五四运动前李大钊同志发表的一系列论文中已经表现出来。他在“布尔什维主义的胜利”一文中就说明了群众运动的重大意义，指出军阀、官僚、贵族等一切旧势力都将在群众革命运动的潮流中淹没。在1919年1月发表的“新纪元”中，指出全世界“劳动阶级要联合”、“打倒全世界资本的阶级。总同盟罢工，就是他们的武器。”同年3月发表的“唐山煤厂工人生活”，不仅对工人群众表示了深切的同情，而且说明他已经注意中国工人问题了。在“青年与农村”这篇文章中，李大钊同志一方面对中国农村的野蛮统治表现了极大的不满，同时指出，要彻底改变中国社会，“非把知识阶级同劳动阶级打成一片不可”，鼓励青年和知识分子要学习俄国青年的榜样，同工人农民联系在一起，要在劳动人民中“去宣传人道主义、社会主义的道理。”这就初步提出了知识分子同劳动人民结合共同斗争的思想。
    这种影响也波及到资产阶级和小资产阶级的知识分子。1918年3月在中国第一次出现了以“劳动”命名的杂志，在一卷一号上，它提出要“尊重劳动，提倡劳动主义，培植劳动者之道德，灌输劳动者以世界知识，纪述世界劳动者之行动，以明社会问题的真象，促进我国劳动者与世界劳动者一致解决社会问题”。1918年11月，著名的资产阶级民主主义教育家蔡元培在一次群众集会上的演说中喊出了“劳工神圣”的口号。这个口号反映了中国知识分子在世界革命高潮的影响下对劳动人民的一种新认识，因此在广大知识分子中很快流传起来。当然，在五四运动以前，知识分子对“劳工神圣”的理解还只是抽象的、模糊的，他们所说的“劳工”也并不是严格地指工人阶级，而是包括各阶级的知识分子在内。但是这个口号却表明，甚至极端脱离人民、一向抱着“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”和“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的传统思想的中国资产阶级知识分子中也有一些人在对劳动人民的看法上开始有了转变。
    由于帝国主义侵略的步步加紧，段祺瑞政府的卖国更加疯狂，这就引起了广大知识分子和青年学生的极大不满，他们逐渐认识到要拯救国家于危亡，光靠纸上谈兵是不行的，而必须走出书斋，和群众一起进行直接的革命活动。在李大钊和陈独秀主编的“每周评论”上发表的一些文章就表明了这种认识。在1918年末出版的第一号上发表的“国际社会之改造”一文写道：“须知道我们大多数平民的生活，是我们大多数平民可以自己改造的，并不是天生就的，亦不是贵族给我们的”，“要想谋世界永久的和平，人类切实的幸福，就应该动起手来，胆子不要太小了”。1919年1月发表的“除三害”一文更大声疾呼，号召人民起来去反对军阀、官僚、政客的压迫。
    这样，在伟大十月革命的影响下，在各国无产阶级革命运动和工人罢工运动高潮的冲击下，在殖民地国家接连不断的民族解放运动的刺激下，中国人民首先是广大青年学生和知识分子的觉悟和认识大大提高了，争取民族解放和自由的革命斗争意志更为增强了。因此，当1919年巴黎和会上丧权辱国的消息传来时，人们掩不住的心头的愤怒像火山一样迸发出来，掀起了反对日本帝国主义和卖国军阀政府的伟大五四运动。
    五四运动时期虽然还没有中国共产党，但是已经有了大批的赞成俄国革命的具有初步共产主义的知识分子。五四运动的初期，是共产主义知识分子、革命的小资产阶级知识分子和资产阶级知识分子三部分人的统一战线的革命运动，其中共产主义知识分子是革命的领导骨干，而资产阶级知识分子乃是它的右翼。就是说，在其开始仅是限于知识分子。但发展到六三运动时，就不但是知识分子，而且有广大的无产阶级、小资产阶级和资产阶级参加，成了全国范围的革命运动了。毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中分析五四革命运动的意义和它同十月革命的关系时指出：五四运动是反帝国主义的运动，又是反封建的运动。五四运动的杰出的历史意义，在于它带着为辛亥革命还不曾有的姿态，这就是彻底地不妥协地反帝国主义和彻底地不妥协地反封建主义。五四运动是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的。五四运动是当时无产阶级世界革命的一部分。
    五四运动可以说是十月革命在中国所引起的反响的第一个政治行动。伟大十月革命划分了整个世界历史的时代，也改变了中国革命发展的方向，而五四运动则成了中国由旧民主主义革命到新民主主义革命的转折点。
