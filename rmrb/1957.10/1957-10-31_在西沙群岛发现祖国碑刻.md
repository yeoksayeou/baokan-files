    Discovery of Ancestral Homeland Stele on the Xisha Islands
    This stone stele was discovered by staff members of the Guangzhou Cultural Park while collecting specimens in the tropical shrubs at the southern end of North Island in the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea. The stele is approximately sixty centimeters high, eighteen centimeters wide, and four centimeters thick. The inscription in the middle of the stele reads "Inspection Commemoration," and on the left side, it reads "Great Qing Guangxu Twenty-eighth Year." The stele is complete and intact.
    The discovery of this stele clearly demonstrates that our working people were already developing the Xisha Islands more than fifty years ago, and the government at that time also sent officials to inspect the area. This is a powerful refutation of the imperialists' slanders and their vain attempts to encroach upon our territory. (Yun)

    在西沙群岛发现祖国碑刻
    这块石碑是广州文化公园工作人员在南海西沙群岛北岛南端的热带灌木丛中采集标本时发现的。碑身高约六十公分、宽十八公分、厚四公分，碑上中间刻“视察纪念”、左边刻“大清光绪二十八年”字样。碑石完整无缺。
    这个石碑的发现，清楚地说明了我国的劳动人民远在五十多年前，就已在西沙群岛进行开发，当时政府还曾派了官员到那里去视察。这对帝国主义者信口雌黄，妄想侵犯我国领土的阴谋企图，是一个有力的驳斥。（云）
