    Chemical Plants and Our Lives
    Xiao Wen
    For many people, the products of the chemical industry are not unfamiliar. Stepping into a department store, you can see all kinds of transparent and beautiful toothbrushes, combs, chopsticks, and film. However, merely seeing these is not enough to deeply understand the great significance of developing a modern chemical industry.
    On the banks of the Songhua River in Jilin City, the Chinese working class, with the help of the Soviet people, built three large-scale, modern chemical plants: the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, the Jilin Dyestuff Plant, and the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant. The completion of these three major chemical plants will make a great contribution to the increase in agricultural production and the development of industries such as plastics, rubber, paint, medicine, and artificial wool, and it is also closely related to the lives of each of us. Now, let me focus on introducing the relationship between the three major chemical plants and the people's lives.
    One Jin of Ammonium Nitrate, Five Jin of Grain
    Farmers all know that using more chemical fertilizers in the fields can increase grain production. The chemical fertilizer currently produced by the Jilin Fertilizer Plant is called ammonium nitrate. This ammonium nitrate contains 34% nitrogen, which is more than 10% higher than the nitrogen content of ammonium sulfate, which is commonly used in rural areas of our country. High nitrogen content is conducive to the growth of crops. According to reliable surveys, one jin of ammonium sulfate can increase grain production by three jin, while one jin of ammonium nitrate can increase grain production by five jin. Its cost is low, because the raw materials for manufacturing ammonium nitrate are inexhaustible water, air, and poor-quality coal. After the Jilin Fertilizer Plant is fully put into production, its annual output will account for about one-fifth of the current total output of chemical fertilizers in the country.
    Mass production of chemical fertilizers is one of the important ways to solve China's grain problem in the future. China is characterized by a large population and little land. The total cultivated land area in the country is only 1.68 billion mu. Allocated according to a population of 600 million, each person cannot even get three mu of land; in many areas, such as Guangdong Province, each person cannot even get one mu of land on average. China's population is increasing rapidly, with an average annual increase of 13 to 14 million people. Since liberation, especially after agricultural cooperation, grain production has increased year by year, but the grain problem is still very tight. One way to solve the grain problem is to reclaim wasteland. However, there is not much reclaimable wasteland in our country, and most of it is in remote areas. The investment in reclaiming wasteland is very large (it costs at least 50 yuan to reclaim one mu of wasteland in the Northeast), and there are many difficulties. For a country with a large population and little land like ours, it is of great significance to increase the yield per unit area by developing chemical fertilizers. Of course, building chemical fertilizer plants also requires a considerable investment, but it is much cheaper than reclaiming wasteland. It is estimated that we only need an investment of about 1 billion yuan to produce 1 million tons of chemical fertilizers, which can increase grain production by 3 million tons (calculated based on one jin of ammonium sulfate increasing grain production by three jin). However, to increase grain production by 3 million tons by reclaiming wasteland, at least 30 million mu of wasteland must be reclaimed. If calculated according to the need for 50 yuan to reclaim one mu of wasteland in the Northeast, then 1.5 billion yuan is needed to reclaim 30 million mu of wasteland. We can produce 1 million tons of chemical fertilizers a year by building chemical fertilizer plants; but it is difficult for us to reclaim 30 million mu of wasteland in one year. Therefore, we should vigorously develop chemical fertilizers. Now, we have built the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, and we will build more chemical fertilizer plants in the future. If we can produce 50 million tons of chemical fertilizers every year in a few years, then we can increase grain production by 300 billion jin. This increase is almost equal to the current total grain production in the country.
        Let People Dress Up More Beautifully
    We all need dyes. However, in the past, the dyes we used, especially high-grade dyes, were mostly imported from abroad, costing a lot of foreign exchange every year. Now, the first phase of the Jilin Dyestuff Plant has been put into production. It can produce seven kinds of high-grade dyes—Indanthrene, Duranthrene Blue, Naphthol, etc. These dyes can be dyed into blue, sky blue, red, jujube red, and maroon, and can be used to dye khaki, drill, and dark serge, as well as printed cloth, bed sheets, and other items. These dyes are durable and not afraid of sun and rain. They are good dyes that never fade. The sky blue cloth dyed with Indanthrene produced by the Jilin Dyestuff Plant will not change color no matter how you wash it. The Jilin Dyestuff Plant also produces dye intermediates. This intermediate can be made into high-grade dyes, or it can be transformed into hundreds of beautiful and colorful colors. Dye intermediates are also indispensable raw materials for the manufacture of plastics, pigments, medicines, and high-grade paints. For example, the phthalic anhydride already produced by the Jilin Dyestuff Plant looks very simple. It is just a white, fine, needle-like crystal. Its use is very large. It is indispensable for the production of Indanthrene; it is impossible to manufacture plastics without it; and it is also necessary to produce high-grade paints applied to aircraft.
    The Jilin Dyestuff Plant is a place that brings beautiful colors to the people of the whole country. The quantity of dyes it produces is very large. The seven kinds of dyes produced in the first phase alone are enough for each of the 600 million people in the country to dye a beautiful piece of clothing. Three hundred million women in the country can each dye a top with Indanthrene produced by it. Everyone knows that Indanthrene and Duranthrene Blue are both very expensive commodities. Indanthrene has a strong coloring power. Two ounces of Indanthrene can dye at least one hundred feet of cloth. We usually use vulcanized blue dye to dye one hundred feet of cloth, which requires at least one jin and two ounces. When the Jilin Dyestuff Plant is fully put into production in the future, it can produce seventy-six kinds of high-grade dyes, which can completely meet the needs of the domestic market.
    The completion of the Jilin Dyestuff Plant marks the beginning of China's independent dye industry. From raw materials to processing, from high-grade dyes to dye intermediates, all are produced completely independently. There was no independent dye industry in old China. In the past, there were two small dye processing plants in Shanghai and Tianjin, but they could not process independently. The dye market in old China was almost entirely controlled by imperialist countries such as Germany. Today, with our independent dye industry, we can change the backward phenomenon of relying on foreign imports in the past. The Jilin Dyestuff Plant will use its own products to accumulate funds for the country and help the people of the whole country dress up more beautifully.
              The Changeable Calcium Carbide
    Every night, we can see bright light coming from slender cylinders at small stalls in the streets and alleys of Beijing. This is a lamp lit with calcium carbide. The Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant began mass production of calcium carbide as early as the end of May this year. Calcium carbide is the mother of the organic synthetic chemical industry. It is like a magical and changeable monster that can be transformed into synthetic fibers, and can also make all kinds of plastics and rubber. It can also be mixed with oxygen and burned to generate heat energy of more than 3,000 degrees Celsius to weld or cut the metal structures of bridges and buildings.
    The Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant can now produce calcium carbide and calcium cyanamide. It is an important base for China's organic synthetic chemical industry. In the future, it can use calcium carbide and calcium cyanamide as raw materials to manufacture plastics, rubber, medicines, and artificial wool that people urgently need.
            Durable Capron
    The completion of these three major chemical plants has also opened up a path for China to produce synthetic fibers. The products produced by the Jilin Fertilizer Plant and the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant, such as calcium carbide and synthetic ammonia, are important raw materials for synthetic fibers. With these raw materials, adding some new equipment, and using sulfuric acid and benzene extracted from coal, a synthetic fiber called "Capron" can be mass-produced. After the three major chemical plants in Jilin start production, they will be expanded, and they will produce this Capron in the future.
    Many readers may not be very familiar with the uses of Capron. People who have been to Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places may have bought shirts made of this Capron. Some people have worn this kind of shirt for ten years without it breaking. After wearing it, wash it and iron it with an iron, and it still looks like new. The firmness of this Capron is more than ten times stronger than that of cotton. Capron can be used to make shirts, as well as coats, trousers, and socks. Clothes made of Capron are light, soft, and beautiful. It is much stronger than cotton fabrics, but its price is only three or four times more expensive than cotton fabrics. The price will be cheaper after our country can manufacture it ourselves.
    We must work hard to produce this Capron in the future. This is one of the important methods to solve the problem of clothing for the people of our country. There is not much cotton field in our country, only about 90 million mu in the whole country. We cannot develop cotton fields on a large scale in the future, because increasing cotton fields on a large scale will affect grain production. Cotton production has increased a lot in recent years, but the national cotton production is still less than 30 million dan. With a population of 600 million, everyone has to buy cotton and wear clothes, and the quantity of cotton and cotton cloth needed is increasing. At present, because cotton production is not large, the production and supply of cotton cloth are not sufficient. In recent years, the Party and the People's Government have been working hard to increase the production of cotton and cotton cloth, and have mobilized all parties to try their best to save cloth. However, to fully meet the people's increasing needs for clothing, it is not enough to rely solely on the increase in the production of cotton and cotton cloth. We must also think of more ways. Our Party has decided to vigorously develop the production of Capron synthetic fibers in the future, in order to better solve the people's clothing problem. Because building more Capron factories is not as restricted by arable land and weather as growing cotton. The completion of the three major chemical plants in Jilin can help our country produce Capron faster. In the near future, we will be able to wear durable and beautiful domestic Capron clothes.
    Our Party is always concerned about the improvement of the people's lives. Developing the chemical industry is one of the important measures. The start of production of the three major chemical plants in Jilin will not only greatly advance the relevant industrial departments, but also be a good start to better solve the problem of eating and dressing for the 600 million people of the whole country. Let us be diligent and thrifty, promote the development of China's chemical industry from all aspects, strive to realize the industrialization of the country as soon as possible, and welcome our better life!

    化工厂和我们的生活
    肖文
    对许多人来说，化学工业的产品是不生疏的。走进百货商店，就能看到各式各样透明美观的牙刷、梳子、筷子和胶卷等等。但是，仅仅看到这些，还不能深刻地理解发展现代化学工业的重大意义。
    在吉林市松花江畔，中国工人阶级在苏联人民的帮助下，建成了三座大型的现代化的化学工厂——吉林肥料厂、吉林染料厂和吉林电石厂。这三大化工厂的建成，对于农业的增产和塑料、橡胶、油漆、医药、人造羊毛等工业的发展将有莫大的贡献，对于我们每一个人的生活也有很密切的关系。现在，让我着重从三大化工厂同人民生活的关系方面作些介绍吧。
    一斤硝酸铵，五斤粮食
    农民们都了解：在田地里多用化学肥料，就能够增产粮食。现在吉林肥料厂已经生产的化学肥料，叫做硝酸铵。这种硝酸铵含氮量达34％，比我国目前农村常用的硫酸铵的含氮量高10％以上。含氮量大，有利于农作物的成长。据可靠的调查，一斤硫酸铵能增产三斤粮食，而一斤硝酸铵能增产五斤粮食。它的成本低廉，因为制造硝酸铵的原料都是取之不尽的水、空气和质量差的煤。吉林肥料厂全面投入生产以后，每年的产量约占目前全国化学肥料总产量的五分之一左右。
    大量生产化学肥料，是解决我国今后粮食问题的重要出路之一。我国的特点是人多地少。全国耕地面积不过十六亿八千万亩。按六亿人口分配，每人还分不到三亩地；不少地区，像广东省平均每人还分不到一亩地。我国人口增加得很快，平均每年要增加一千三、四百万人。解放以后，特别是农业合作化以后，粮食产量历年增长，但是粮食问题还很紧张。解决粮食问题的一个办法是开垦荒地。可是，我国可垦荒地不多，而且多在边远地区，开垦荒地的投资很大（东北开垦一亩荒地至少要五十元），困难很多。像我国这样人多地少的国家，用发展化学肥料的办法来提高单位面积产量，是有非常重大的意义。当然建设化学肥料厂，投资也不小，但比起开荒来要便宜得多。我们要生产一百万吨化学肥料，据估计只要十亿元左右的投资，却可以增产出三百万吨粮食来（按一斤硫酸铵能增产三斤粮食计算）。但是，要用垦荒的办法来增产三百万吨粮食，至少要开垦三千万亩荒地。如果按照东北开垦一亩荒地需要五十元来计算的话，那末开垦三千万亩荒地就需要十五亿元。我们建设化学肥料厂，一年可以生产一百万吨化学肥料；但是我们开荒，一年很难开成三千万亩。因此，我们应该大力发展化学肥料。现在，我们已经建成了吉林肥料厂，将来还要建设更多的化学肥料厂。若干年后，我们每年要是能生产出五千万吨化学肥料，那就可以增产出三千亿斤粮食。这个增产数字几乎等于全国目前粮食的总产量。
        让人们打扮得更漂亮
    我们人人都要用染料。可是，过去我们用的染料，尤其是高级染料，多半是从国外进口的，每年都要花费大量外汇。现在，吉林染料厂第一期工程投入生产了。它能够生产出七种高级染料——阴丹士林、安安蓝、纳夫妥等。这些染料可以染成蓝色、天蓝色、红色、枣红色、酱红色，可以染卡叽、直贡呢和深色哔叽，也可以染印花布、被单等物品。这些染料都经久耐用，不怕日晒雨淋，是永不褪色的好染料。用吉林染料厂生产的阴丹士林，染成天蓝色的布，随你怎么洗，也不会变色。吉林染料厂还出产染料中间体。用这种中间体，可以做成高级染料，也可以变化成上百种美丽多彩的颜色。染料中间体又是制造塑料、颜料、医药、高级油漆等不可缺少的原料。像吉林染料厂已经生产的苯二甲酸酐，外表看来很简单，不过是一种白色的细小的针状结晶体。它的用处却很大。生产阴丹士林，少不了它；制造塑料，没有它不行；生产涂在飞机上的高级油漆，也得要用它。
    吉林染料厂是一个给全国人民带来美丽色彩的地方。它生产的染料数量很大。光是第一期生产的七种染料，就足够全国六亿人口每人染一件漂亮衣裳。全国三亿妇女，每人都可以用它生产的阴丹士林染一件上衣。谁都知道：阴丹士林，安安蓝，都是价格很高的商品。阴丹士林着色力很强，二两阴丹士林至少可以染一百尺布。我们平常用硫化青染料染一百尺布，至少要用一斤三两左右。吉林染料厂将来全部投入生产以后，可以生产出七十六种高级染料，完全能够满足国内市场的需要。
    吉林染料厂的建成，标志着我国开始有了独立的染料工业。从原料到加工，从高级染料到染料中间体，都完全独立生产。旧中国根本没有独立的染料工业，过去上海、天津有两家小型染料加工厂，但是不能独立加工。旧中国的染料市场，几乎都控制在德国等帝国主义国家手中。今天，我们有了独立的染料工业，便可以改变过去依靠国外进口的落后现象了。吉林染料厂将要用自己的产品，来替国家积累资金，来帮助全国人民打扮得更加漂亮。
              善变的电石
    我们每天夜晚在北京街头巷尾的小摊子上，都能看到细长的筒子里放出亮光。这就是用电石点的灯。吉林电石厂早在今年5月底就开始大量生产电石了。电石是有机合成化学工业之母。它好像一个神奇的善变的怪物，能够变化成合成纤维，也能够做出各式各样的塑料、橡胶，也能够和氧气混合燃烧，发生出摄氏三千多度的热能，来焊接或者熔割桥梁、建筑物的金属结构。
    吉林电石厂现在能生产电石，也能生产碳氮化钙。它是我国有机合成化学工业的重要基地。它将来可以用电石和碳氮化钙做原料，来制造人们迫切需要的塑料、橡胶、医药用品和人造羊毛。
            耐用的卡普隆
    这三大化工厂的建成，还为我国生产合成纤维开辟了道路。吉林肥料厂和吉林电石厂生产的产品，像电石、合成氨等等，都是合成纤维的重要原料。有了这些原料，再新增加些设备，利用硫酸和从煤里取出来的苯，就可以大量生产一种名叫“卡普隆”的合成纤维。吉林三大化工厂开工生产以后，还要扩建，将来就要生产这种卡普隆。
    不少读者对于卡普隆的用处也许还不大熟悉。到过广州、上海等地的人，或许曾经买过这种卡普隆做的衬衣。有人穿这种衬衣，穿了十年还没有破。穿了以后，洗一洗，用熨斗烫过，还像新的一样。这种卡普隆的坚固程度要比棉花强十多倍。用卡普隆，可以做衬衣，也可以做外衣、裤子和袜子。卡普隆做的衣服，轻巧柔软，又很美观。它比棉织品结实得多，但是它的价格只比棉织品贵三、四倍。我国自己能制造以后，价格还会便宜。
    我们今后要努力生产这种卡普隆。这是解决我国人民穿衣问题的重要方法之一。我国棉田不多，全国只有九千万亩左右。我们今后不能大量发展棉田，因为大量增加棉田，就会影响粮食的产量。这几年棉花产量增加不少，但是全国棉花产量还不到三千万担。六亿人口，人人要买棉花，要穿衣服，需要棉花和棉布的数量越来越多。目前，因为棉花产量不大，棉布生产和供应都不够充分。这几年，党和人民政府一直在努力设法增产棉花、棉布，并且动员各方面尽力节省用布。但是，要完全满足人民日益增加的对穿衣的需要，光靠棉花和棉布的增产还不行，还得要想更多的办法。我们的党决定今后要大力发展卡普隆合成纤维的生产，就是为了更好地解决人民穿衣的问题。因为多建设些卡普隆工厂，不像种植棉花那样要受到耕地和天气的限制。吉林三大化工厂的建成，可以帮助我国更快地生产出卡普隆。不久的将来，我们就要能够穿上经久耐用的美丽的国产卡普隆衣服了。
    我们的党无时无刻不在关心着人民生活的改善。发展化学工业就是重要措施之一。吉林三大化工厂的开工生产，不仅将使有关工业部门大大前进一步，对于更好地解决全国六亿人民的吃饭、穿衣问题也是一个良好的开端。让我们克勤克俭，从各方面促进我国化学工业的发展，争取早日实现国家的工业化，迎接我们更美好的生活吧！
