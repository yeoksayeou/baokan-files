    Entirely Reliant on the Agricultural Cooperative
    At a station close to home, a blind man got on the train. The conductor helped him to a vacant seat next to me.
    I asked him, "Are you a fortune teller?"
    "No."
      "Are you a street singer?"
      "No, I'm not."
      "Then what do you do?"
      "I don't do anything."
      "Do you have any family?"
      "No family, just me."
      "Then how do you live?"
      "Entirely reliant on Chairman Mao."
    I had heard many people say this at home before, but it sounded very fresh to me now.
      "You mean entirely reliant on the agricultural cooperative, right?"
      "Yes." He smiled.
    After a while, I asked him again:
      "Where are you going now?"
      "To the city!"
      "What are you going to do there?"
    "To the hospital to see a doctor."
    "Where did you get the money?"
    "The agricultural cooperative gave it to me, and the cooperative also gave me the train fare. Our cooperative treats those of us who have no labor power very well, giving us money to make clothes, giving us money to buy rice, salt, and oil, and if we are sick, they also give us money to get treatment."

    全靠农业社
    在快到家的一个车站上，有个双眼瞎了的人上车。售票员把他扶在我旁边的空座位上坐下。
    我问他：“是算命的？”
    “不是。”
      “是卖唱的？”
      “也不是。”
      “那你是干什么的？”
      “我什么也没有干。”
      “你家还有什么人？”
      “没有什么人，只有我一个。”
      “那你的生活怎么过？”
      “全靠毛主席。”
    这句话我以前在家听到许多人说过，但现在听起来似乎很新鲜。
      “是全靠农业合作社吧？”
      “是。”他笑了。
    过一会儿，我又问他：
      “你现在到哪里去？”
      “到城里去！”
      “去做什么？”
    “到医院去看病。”
    “你哪来的钱？”
    “是农业社给的，车费也是农业社给我的。我们社对待我们一些没劳动力的人十分好，给钱我们做衣服，给钱我们买米买盐买油，有病，还给钱我们去治。”
