Soviet Brothers Cheer for China's Achievements

(I) Dear Chinese Friends:

Please allow me, through the newspaper, to congratulate the great Chinese people on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and wish you happiness and even greater achievements in the cause of building your motherland.

I am an ordinary Soviet citizen. I live in the city of Kyiv, far away from you, but on this wonderful day, my heart is with you. I cheer for every achievement of your country. In 1950, I had the honor of visiting your country, and those most beautiful impressions of my life are unforgettable. Everything I saw in your country excited me. I especially love the simple, tireless laborers of China. They are good comrades and loyal friends.

When I came to your country, you were still experiencing economic difficulties, and I knew that these were the traces of long-term war and the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. But the Chinese Communist Party, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, led the people to drive out these enemies and begin to build a new life. Your people are working heroically, and your first Five-Year Plan is proof of this, a plan that you can undoubtedly complete and exceed. I believe and know that at the construction posts, in Shenyang, in Anshan, in Beijing, in Shanghai, at the Changchun First Automobile Factory, at the Yangtze River Bridge construction site, and in agricultural production cooperatives, there must be many famous and unsung heroes who are selflessly working for the beautiful life of the people. Although you have difficulties, they are temporary, and these difficulties will soon be overcome with your hard work.

Although the Chiang Kai-shek clique still occupies Taiwan, and the American imperialists and their echoers do not recognize the People's Republic of China; however, we believe that Taiwan will surely return to the embrace of your motherland, and the People's Republic of China will surely obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

We, all the Soviet people, are happy for your achievements. We are excited to see that you can now produce your own airplanes and locomotives, and that trains run on new roads, carrying new lathes and machines, passing through new bridges, and crossing the turbulent, tamed rivers.

We are very happy that your lives have improved, and we believe that your life tomorrow will be better than today.

I would like to embrace you in the name of the Soviet people and wish you even greater success in your work and a happier life. Long live the great Chinese people and their government! Long live the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong! Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!

Kostiuk

(II) Dear Comrades:

Please allow me, an ordinary Soviet engineer, through the newspaper to congratulate the Chinese people on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

In 1945, I and the Soviet army participated in the war to eliminate the Japanese Kwantung Army and liberate the people of Northeast China. I still remember the first few cities we liberated, such as Tongliao, Fuxin, Jinzhou, etc. I remember how warmly the Chinese people welcomed us.

Now, as your country advances along the socialist road, along the road indicated by Marxism-Leninism, all Soviet people are happy for your every achievement.

In the newspapers, we can often read news about the construction of new factories in Shenyang, Jinzhou, and other cities. I really want to go to China again and see your achievements with my own eyes, and see how our best friends – the Chinese people – live and work.

I really want my son to be able to understand China well, to understand your ancient culture. I really hope that he can go to China to study, and if this ideal can be realized, then I will be the happiest father.

Dear friends! My family and I sincerely congratulate you again on the festival. We wish you new and greater achievements in socialist construction.

Long live the Chinese people!

    苏联兄弟为中国的成就而欢呼
    （一）亲爱的中国朋友们：
    请允许我通过报纸，向伟大的中国人民祝贺中华人民共和国成立八周年，并祝你们幸福和在建设祖国的事业中获得更大的成就。
    我是一个普通的苏联人。我住在基辅市，离你们很远，但是在这个美好的日子，我同你们心连心。我为你们国家的每一个成就而欢呼。1950年我荣幸地到过贵国，那些我一生中最美好的印象使我终生难忘。在贵国看到的一切使我很兴奋。我特别爱的是中国的朴实、不知疲劳的劳动者。他们是好同志，是忠实的朋友。
    当我到你们国家的时候，你们在经济上还很困难，我知道这是长期战争和蒋介石集团统治的痕迹。但以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导着人民赶走了这些敌人，开始建设新的生活。你们的人民正在英勇地劳动着，你们的第一个五年计划就是个证明，这个计划你们无疑地可以完成并超额完成。我相信并且知道在建设的岗位上，在沈阳，在鞍山，在北京，在上海，在长春第一汽车厂，在长江大桥工地，在农业生产合作社，一定有许许多多有名和无名的英雄，他们为了人民的美好生活而忘我地劳动着。虽然你们也有困难，但这是一时的，这些困难在你们的辛勤劳动下将很快地被克服。
    虽然蒋介石集团还占据着台湾，美帝国主义及其应声虫不承认中华人民共和国；但是，我们相信台湾必将回到你们祖国的怀抱，中华人民共和国在联合国中必将取得其合法地位。
    我们，所有的苏联人全为你们的成就高兴。我们兴奋地看到你们现在自己能生产飞机和火车头，火车奔驰在新的道路上，载着新的车床与机器，穿过新的桥梁，跨过浪涛澎湃的驯服的大河。
    你们现在生活改善了，这使我们非常高兴，我们相信你们明天的生活将比今天更好。
    我想用苏联人的名义拥抱你们，并祝你们在劳动中获得更大的成绩，生活得更幸福。伟大的中国人民及其政府万岁！中国共产党和中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！中苏友好万岁！
                                              克斯丘克
    （二）亲爱的同志：
    请允许我，一个普通的苏联工程师，通过报纸向中国人民祝贺中华人民共和国成立八周年纪念日。
    在1945年我和苏联军队一起，参加了消灭日本关东军、解放中国东北人民的战争。我现在还记得我们最先解放的几个城市，如通辽、阜新、锦州等。我记得中国人民是多么热情地欢迎了我们。
    现在当你们的国家沿着社会主义道路、沿着马克思列宁主义所指示的道路前进的时候，全体苏联人都为你们的每个成绩而高兴。
    在报上经常可以读到关于在沈阳、锦州和其他城市建设新工厂的消息，我非常想再一次到中国去，亲眼看看你们的成就，看看我们最好的朋友——中国人民怎样地生活和劳动着。
    我非常想使自己的儿子能够很好地了解中国、了解你们古老的文化。我非常希望他能到中国去学习，如果这个理想能够实现的话，那么我将是最幸福的父亲了。
    亲爱的朋友们！我和我的家庭衷心地再一次向你们祝贺节日。祝你们在社会主义建设中获得新的、更大的成就。
    中国人民万岁！
    尤·车汉斯基
