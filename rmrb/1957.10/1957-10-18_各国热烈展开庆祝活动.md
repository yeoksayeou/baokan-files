Xinhua News Agency, October 17th, Moscow dispatch via TASS, October 16th: The National Committee of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada has made a resolution on celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution.

The resolution says: The National Committee of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, representing the party and its supporters, warmly congratulates the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution. As a communist party holding the same Marxist-Leninist views, we congratulate our brother party, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on this festival.

The resolution points out the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in establishing a socialist society that has eliminated exploitation forever for the past forty years. It says: "In advancing towards the pinnacle of this human achievement, the Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have paved the way for all mankind. The Marxist-Leninist principles, fully embodied in the theory and practice of the Communist Party, not only guide the Soviet people to today's height of civilization, but also play a guiding role in the socialist liberation cause of the working class and the exploited people in various countries, according to the specific conditions of each country."

The resolution then points out, "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the leading party of the world communist movement. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union's higher level of experience than other communist parties is a valuable asset for communists and socialists in all countries. This experience can be learned and applied in the actual situation in their own countries."

In the resolution, the National Committee of the Labor-Progressive Party points out the firm struggle waged by the Soviet Union for peace and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The resolution says, "Now, the Soviet Union is the leading force in the socialist camp from the People's Republic of China to the German Democratic Republic. Millions of colonial people and countries that have recently gained independence from imperialist rule all support the principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual assistance, and respect for national integrity."

Finally, the National Committee stated that the Canadian working people are united with the Soviet Union.
