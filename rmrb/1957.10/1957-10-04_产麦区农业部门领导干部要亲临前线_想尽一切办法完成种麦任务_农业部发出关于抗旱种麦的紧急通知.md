    Leading Cadres of Agricultural Departments in Wheat-Producing Areas Should Go to the Front Lines
    Exhaust All Means to Complete the Wheat Planting Task
    The Ministry of Agriculture Issues Emergency Notice on Fighting Drought and Planting Wheat
    (Reported by this newspaper) Recently, drought has appeared in provinces along the Yellow River Basin, seriously affecting timely wheat planting. The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued an emergency notice to the agricultural departments of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Anhui provinces on quickly launching drought resistance and wheat planting efforts.
    The notice pointed out: The wheat fields in these areas account for more than three-fifths of the total wheat field area in the country, generally accounting for about 40% of the total grain crop area. If the opportunity for wheat sowing is delayed, it will seriously affect wheat production, which will not only affect the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, but also affect the completion of the national grain production plan for the coming year. Party and government leaders at all levels have already paid attention to this situation and have taken many measures. Now that the Autumn Equinox has passed, wheat planting is imminent. Agricultural departments at all levels must complete the wheat planting task in a combat posture under the unified leadership of local Party and government. It is necessary to rely on agricultural cooperatives and fully mobilize the masses to fight drought and plant wheat. “Planting one more mu is one more mu, and planting one day earlier is one day better.” At the same time, we must not be careless in planting due to the rush of time, so as to avoid missing seedlings and reduced production. Not only should we "plant early," but also strive to "plant well." For land that has already been cultivated and harrowed, it is necessary to seize the moisture and plant early, without plowing again, so as to avoid moisture loss. For land that has been plowed but not harrowed, various methods should be used to break up the clods, and plant with retained moisture. For land that has not yet been plowed, it should be deeply harrowed and the soil crushed, then shallowly plowed and finely harrowed, so that it can be planted with slight moisture. We must achieve drought resistance without rain and rush planting with rain. We must make full use of all water sources and strive to irrigate one more mu of land and plant one more mu of wheat. In areas with channels, water should be used rationally to expand the irrigated area. In areas with wells, the well platforms should be raised and watered day and night in shifts. In areas with insufficient waterwheels, the method of moving waterwheels should also be adopted to expand their effectiveness; in areas without waterwheels, all available tools for lifting water should be used. Where water sources are insufficient, planting by watering spots, planting in ditches, or using water-powered plows should be used.
    The notice called on leading cadres of agricultural administrative departments at all levels to go to the front lines and specifically help agricultural cooperatives formulate plans, arrange labor and animal power, and find water sources. In short, we must think of every possible way, by every means, to complete the sowing task.

    产麦区农业部门领导干部要亲临前线
    想尽一切办法完成种麦任务
    农业部发出关于抗旱种麦的紧急通知
    本报讯  黄河流域各省最近出现了干旱现象，严重影响适期种麦。农业部日前向河北、山东、河南、山西、陕西、甘肃、江苏、湖北、安徽等省农业厅发出了关于迅速开展抗旱种麦的紧急通知。
    通知指出：这些地区麦田面积占全国麦田总面积的五分之三以上，一般占粮食作物总面积的40％左右。如果延误了小麦播种的时机，将严重影响小麦产量，不但关系到农业社的巩固，并且影响到来年全国粮食生产计划的完成。各地党政领导方面已经重视这一情况，并且采取了很多措施。现在秋分已过，种麦已迫不及待。各级农业部门必须在各地党政统一领导下，用战斗姿态完成种麦任务。要依靠农业合作社，全力发动群众抗旱种麦。“多种一亩是一亩，早种一天好一天”。同时，也不可因为抢时间而播种粗糙，以免缺苗减产。不仅要“种得早”，还要争取“种得好”。对已经耕好耙好的地，要抢墒早种，不要再耕翻，以免跑墒。耕而未耙好的地，应采用多种方法，打碎土块，接墒播种。尚未耕翻的地，应深耙碎土，再浅耕细耙，使稍得雨墒即可播种。要做到无雨抗旱，有雨抢种。要充分利用一切水源，力争多浇一亩地，多种一亩麦。有渠道地区，要合理用水，扩大浇地面积。有水井地区，要垫高井台，日夜轮浇。水车不足地区，还要采用水车搬家办法，扩大效用；没有水车的，要利用一切可用来提水的工具。水源不足的，用浇水点种沟种或水耧等办法播种。
    通知中号召各级农业行政部门的领导干部亲临前线，具体帮助农业社制订计划，安排劳力、畜力，寻找水源。总之，要想尽一切办法，千方百计，完成播种任务。
