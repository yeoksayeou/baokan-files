How to Observe Artificial Earth Satellites
    Chen Zungui

The successful launch of the first artificial Earth satellite in human history by the Soviet Union has shaken the world. Peace-loving people not only cheer for the strength of the peace camp, not only cheer for the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, but also want to be able to see this "Lucky Star" with their own eyes, especially scientific workers, astronomy enthusiasts, and radio enthusiasts, who want to contribute to the observation of this epoch-making "satellite" that opens a new era of science.

The artificial Earth satellite was successfully launched based on precise calculations of numbers and mechanics, coupled with advanced science and technology. Whether these theoretical calculations truly match the actual situation, and whether the artificial Earth satellite truly follows the predetermined orbit when launched into the high altitude, requires observation data from various locations on Earth to verify the errors in the theoretical calculations. China has a vast territory, spanning over fifty degrees of east-west longitude and over forty degrees of north-south latitude. If data cannot be provided in this region, then this area will be a blank spot, which will have a great impact on the determination of the artificial Earth satellite's orbit. In terms of scientific research and politics, we should try our best to organize observation teams to conduct observations. The main purpose of our observation is to fill the blank spots in observations in this large segment of space. The observation requirements, in addition to measuring the precise longitude and latitude of the local area, also include recording the azimuth and time of the artificial Earth satellite passing through the local sky. If the observation is of the artificial Earth satellite passing through the meridian, then only its time and zenith distance need to be recorded.

The observation methods can be divided into optical and radio methods. The optical method uses multiple wide-angle telescopes, hung on a meridian line, to guard the sky in zones, to see the zenith distance of the artificial satellite passing through the meridian. The time accuracy is required to be within one-tenth of a second, which can be achieved using an electric timer and chronograph.

The Chinese observation team plans to use fifteen telescopes with a field of view of eight degrees, each guarding eight degrees of the sky. In this way, the artificial satellite can be seen when it passes through this one hundred and twenty-degree sky. The Beijing Planetarium has now organized wind measuring theodolites from the military meteorological department and the meteorology major of Peking University, with a maximum of fifty-six units. Each unit has an average field of view of three degrees, which can completely cover the sky on the meridian. Each theodolite is equipped with a button. When the observer sees the star image passing the meridian, they press the button, which records the time accurate to one-tenth of a second on the chronograph. The zenith distance can be read from the theodolite.

Units with radio transmitters can listen to the signals of artificial satellites and record their direction at the same time; it is best to use radar for orientation. Ordinary radios cannot receive them. In addition, photographic methods can be used to photograph the image of artificial satellites, which requires special equipment, and the time accuracy must reach one-thousandth of a second. These tasks cannot be done by ordinary people.

Sometimes it can also be seen with the naked eye. Moscow has seen it very clearly. At around 5:31 am on October 15th, students from Peking University saw it with the naked eye at the Beijing Planetarium. Observation time must be in the early morning before the sun rises or in the evening after the sun has just set. Because at this time the ground is already dark and there is still sunlight in the upper sky, the artificial satellite will emit bright light when illuminated by these sunlight, making it easy for us to recognize its existence. For naked eye observation, it is best to adjust the time beforehand and record the time elapsed from when the artificial satellite is seen to when it is no longer visible. If you can record and draw its approximate azimuth, the results can be notified to the local astronomical institutions, such as Nanjing can notify the Zijinshan Observatory, and Beijing can notify the Beijing Planetarium, which will be unified and compiled and then notified to the Soviet Union by telegram.

Matters needing attention during observation: First, the longitude and latitude of the observation location must be accurately measured, and the time must be aligned. Observers must practice and be proficient in advance, and do not panic. Do not forget to press the button when you see the star image. Do not mistake meteors, airplanes, or meteorological balloons for artificial satellites. Units in the country with wind measuring theodolites can organize several units to observe together.

During observation, it is best to first look for the starting direction by visual observers according to the direction predicted by the radio station or newspaper. After finding it, notify others or those guarding the wide-angle telescope, and those facing that direction can pay special attention. If there is time, other personnel can turn the telescope over. It is best to organize a group of people with binoculars to look first; because binoculars have a larger field of view, it is easier to find.

The successful launch of the artificial Earth satellite is truly a great scientific and technological achievement of our Soviet elder brother; we should work hard to observe it, so as not to be unworthy of being a younger brother. I hope everyone will work hard to observe it!

    怎样观察人造地球卫星
    陈遵妫
    苏联发射人类历史上的第一颗人造地球卫星成功，震动了全世界。爱好和平的人民不独为和平阵营力量的强大而欢呼，不独为苏联科学技术的先进而欢呼，而且还想能够亲眼来看看这个“福星”，特别是科学工作者们、天文爱好者们、无线电爱好者们，更想能够在这颗开辟科学新纪元的划时代的“卫星”的观察方面，尽一分自己的力量。
    人造地球卫星是根据数字和力学的严密推算，加上高度的科学技术而发射成功的。这些根据理论的计算，是否真正附和于实际的情况，人造地球卫星发射到高空，是不是真真老是遵照着预定的轨道运行，则需要地球上各地方的观测资料来订证理论计算上的误差。我国地方广大，东西经度占五十度以上，南北纬度占四十度以上，在这个区域里面，倘若不能提出数据，则这段地区就是空白点；这对人造地球卫星轨道的确定，将有很大的影响。在科学研究上和在政治上来讲，我们都应该尽量组织观测队来从事观测。我们观察的主要目的，就是负责填补这一大段空间的观测的空白点。观测的要求，除了要测出当地的精确经纬度外，还要纪录人造地球卫星通过当地天空的方位和时间。倘若观测人造地球卫星通过子午圈的话，而只要纪录它的时间和天顶距离。
    观测的方法，可以分为光学的和无线电的两种。光学的方法，是利用多架广角望远镜，挂在一条子午线上，分区守着天空，来看人造卫星经过子午线的天顶距离。时间要求精确到十分之一秒，可用通电计时表和记时仪。
    中国观测队的计划就是利用视野八度的望远镜十五架，分别守着八度的天空，这样人造卫星是通过这一百二十度天空内的时候都可以看到。北京天文馆现在组织了部队气象部、和北京大学气象专业的测风经纬仪，最多时候共五十六架，每架视野平均三度，这样就可以把子午线上的天空全部守住。每个经纬仪都装有电钮，当观测者看到星影过子午线时候，即按电钮，这样则在记时仪上记下了达到十分之一秒的时间。从经纬仪上可以读出天顶距离。
    具有无线电报机的单位可以收听人造卫星的信号，同时还要把它的方向记录下来；最好是用雷达来定向。一般收音机收不到。另外还可利用照相方法拍摄人造卫星的像，这个需要特种装置，时间精确度要达到千分之一秒。这些工作，不是一般人所能做到的。
    用肉眼有的时候也可以看到。莫斯科曾经很清楚地看见过。10月15日晨五时三十一分前后，北京大学学生在北京天文馆就用肉眼看过。观测时间一定要在清晨太阳还没有出来以前或黄昏太阳刚落下去以后。因为这时候地面已经昏暗而上空还有阳光，人造卫星被这些阳光所照射就会发出明亮的光，使我们容易认出它的存在。肉眼观测最好把时间事先对好，记录人造卫星从看到起到看不见止所经历的时间。倘若能够把它的大概方位记下来画好。结果可以通知当地天文机构，如南京可通知紫金山天文台，北京可通知北京天文馆，将来统一整理后用电报通知苏联。
    观察应注意的事项：首先要把观测地点经纬度测好，还要把时间对准。观察者要事先练习精熟，千万不要慌张，看到星影时候不要忘记按电钮。千万不要把流星、飞机或气象台的气球当做人造卫星。国内备有测风经纬仪的单位，可以组织几个单位来共同观测。
    观察时候最好先根据电台或报纸所预告的方向，由肉眼观察者先向开始的方向去找，找到之后，可通知别人或守望广角望远镜的人，对准那方向的人，可以特别加以注意。其他人员倘若来得及的话，可把望远镜转过去。最好能组织一批具有双眼镜的人先去找；因为双眼镜视野比较大，容易找。
    人造地球卫星的发射成功，真是我们苏联老大哥一个科学技术上的伟大成就；我们应该努力观察，才不愧做一个小弟弟，希望大家努力观察吧！
