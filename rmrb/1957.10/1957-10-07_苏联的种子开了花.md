    Soviet Seeds Blossom

    The flower seeds sent by the Moscow, Jierda, and Minsk Botanical Gardens of the Soviet Union to the Longhua Nursery in Shanghai this year have been sown, and now the flowers are in full bloom, as splendid as brocade.

    The Soviet red-leaf cockscomb, sown in February this year, began to bloom in July, and some have already produced plump seeds. The asters, which began to bloom in September, are now in their most flourishing period.

    The Soviet botanical gardens also sent the nursery more than two hundred kinds of tree seeds with high ornamental value.

    苏联的种子开了花
    苏联莫斯科、集尔达、明斯克三个植物园今年寄给上海龙华苗圃的花卉种子下播后，现在花朵盛开、灿烂如锦。
    今年2月播种的苏联红叶鸡冠花，在7月份就开花，现在有的已经结了饱实的籽粒。在9月份开始开花的紫菀，现在开得最茂盛。
    苏联植物园还给这个苗圃寄来了二百多种观赏价值很高的树木种子。
