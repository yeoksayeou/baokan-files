Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 2nd. The various branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front celebrated National Day amidst intense combat readiness.

    On this festive day, as dawn broke, generals and officers of a certain anti-aircraft unit stationed in the Fuzhou area stepped into the command room to take over the shift. The artillerymen guarding Xiamen and the Huangqi Peninsula sat quietly beside their cannons, braving the light rain and wind, vigilantly monitoring the enemy on the Kinmen and Matsu Islands. Many artillery positions displayed colorful slogans that read: "Defend the coast and protect the people's joyous celebration of the festival." On the night of National Day, coast patrol soldiers and sailors patrolled tirelessly on land and sea.

    On the morning of the festival, officers and soldiers from many agencies and units gathered around radios to listen to the live broadcast of the National Day celebration rally in the capital and Marshal Peng Dehuai's National Day parade speech. Officers and soldiers stationed on the front islands held various recreational competitions and performances in their positions to celebrate. In some places, the troops stationed there also held various forms of get-togethers and friendly ball games with the local people.

    福建前线部队欢度国庆
    新华社福建前线2日电  福建前线中国人民解放军各兵种部队，在紧张备战中欢度国庆节。
    节日这天，当晨曦微露的时候，驻福州地区防空部队某部的将军和校官们便走进了指挥室接班。守卫在厦门和黄岐半岛上的炮兵们，冒着细雨轻风静坐在大炮身旁，警惕地监视着金门、马祖列岛上的敌人。许多炮兵阵地上五彩缤纷的标语上写着：守好海防，保卫人民欢庆佳节。在国庆节之夜，海岸巡逻兵和水兵们不停地巡逻在陆地和海上。
    节日上午，许多机关、部队的官兵们围坐在收音机旁，收听首都各界人民庆祝国庆节大会的实况广播和彭德怀元帅的国庆阅兵讲话。驻守在前沿岛屿上的官兵，在阵地里举行了各种文娱比赛和文艺表演等庆祝活动。有些地方的驻军还和当地人民举行了各种形式的联欢会和球类友谊赛。
