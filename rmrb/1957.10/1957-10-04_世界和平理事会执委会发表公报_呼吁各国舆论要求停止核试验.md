Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd. The Executive Committee of the World Peace Council issued a communiqué on the 1st, stating that the Executive Committee believes more strongly than ever that there is an absolute need to immediately halt nuclear testing. It urges world public opinion, during the United Nations General Assembly, to persistently and unanimously express its views so that national representatives reach an agreement on the immediate cessation of nuclear testing and the first stage of, even if limited, disarmament.

The Executive Committee's communiqué first analyzed the current international situation, pointing out that tensions continue to exist, particularly in the Middle East. The communiqué said that some military and political figures are trying to deceive world public opinion into accepting atomic weapons. Current propaganda attempts to convince the public that atomic weapons are a guarantee of peace, that they can be turned into "clean" weapons, and that atomic conflicts can be limited to certain regions using so-called tactical weapons. This propaganda is intended to conceal actions to intensify the distribution of atomic weapons to certain regions of the world and even to supply the German Federal Defence Force with atomic weapons. At the same time, this propaganda is also intended to cover up opposition to nuclear testing.

The communiqué said that the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting, in which the public had placed great hope, has ended without results. Although the principle of halting nuclear tests has been recognized, no actual agreement has been reached.

The Executive Committee refuted the deceptive claim that a limited atomic war can be conducted, and condemned the attempt to deceive people by calling atomic weapons tactical weapons in order to make them believe that the impact of using such weapons is insignificant and to justify their use.

The Executive Committee recalled that, in order to ensure world peace, it is necessary to use the power of world public opinion to stop foreign interference and attacks on the independence of all peoples.

    世界和平理事会执委会发表公报
    呼吁各国舆论要求停止核试验
    新华社布拉格3日电  世界和平理事会执行委员会在1日发表公报说，执委会比过去任何时候都更加强烈地认为绝对需要立即停止核试验。它敦促世界舆论在联合国举行大会期间，坚持不懈地和一致地表示意见，以便使各国代表就立即停止核试验和第一阶段的、那怕是有限的裁军达成协议。
    执行委员会在公报中首先分析了当前的国际形势，它指出，目前紧张局势继续存在，特别是在中东。公报说，某些军界和政界人士正在设法骗使世界舆论接受原子武器。目前的宣传企图使公众相信原子武器是和平的保证，可以把它变成一种“干净的”武器，而且可以利用某种所谓战术武器把原子冲突限制在某些地区。这种宣传是要掩饰把原子武器加紧分散到世界某些地区去、甚至供给德国国防军以原子武器的行动。同时，这种宣传也是要掩盖人们对核试验的反对。
    公报说，公众曾寄予很大希望的裁军小组委员会会议已经毫无结果地结束了。虽然停止核试验的原则已经得到承认，但是没有实际达成任何协议。
    执委会批驳所谓可以进行有限度的原子战争的骗人的说法，谴责企图把原子武器称为战术武器来骗人相信使用这种武器的影响不大和证明使用它是正当的那种作法。
    执委会追述说，为了保证世界和平，必须利用世界舆论的力量来制止外国的干涉和对各国人民独立的进攻。
