Explanation of the Draft Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security of the People's Republic of China
Luo Ruiqing, Minister of Public Security of the People's Republic of China

Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and Members:

I will now make some explanations on several issues in the draft Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security:

(1) The Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security are proposed in the context of our country having undergone the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations, with the socialist revolution having achieved a decisive victory, and the people demanding further consolidation of the socialist construction order. Our people's democratic government is solid, and social order is stable, which demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system; demonstrates the great achievements of the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations carried out by our country; and also demonstrates the political consciousness and organizational discipline of the hardworking and courageous Chinese people. However, to further consolidate the socialist construction order and create a better working, learning, and living environment for the people, we still have much work to do. Strengthening public security management and fighting against all behaviors that violate order, violate discipline, harm the interests of the people, and corrupt public morals is one aspect of our many tasks. The People's Republic of China has only been established for eight years, and the great socialist transformation was only basically completed last year. Many people still feel unaccustomed to the new socialist system, and changing this situation requires a long process of self-education and awakening for all the people. In particular, various bad elements left over from the old society, as well as the bad thoughts, bad habits, and bad work styles of the exploiting classes, such as harming others for self-interest, seeking profit without labor, and corrupting morality, are constantly influencing some unawakened or weak-willed people and are corroding and undermining the new society. This explains why phenomena that disrupt public order and corrupt social morality still exist in socialist society, and it has its social roots. From an ideological perspective, although our country has basically realized the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, the political and ideological socialist transformation being carried out in people's minds is far from complete. Some people still maintain the bourgeois bad habits of harming others for self-interest, disregarding public morality, and not complying with public order. Many behaviors that violate public security management are manifestations of the conflict between this kind of individualism and collectivism. In order to further protect the interests of the people and ensure the order of socialist construction, we must, while strengthening ideological education, implement necessary mandatory administrative penalties for behaviors such as disrupting public order, endangering public safety, infringing on citizens' personal rights, and damaging public and private property that violate laws and discipline and corrupt morality. This is the common aspiration of the broad masses of the people and is also an urgent requirement in the current further consolidation of public security work. Based on these reasons, and according to the spirit of Articles 49 (12) and 100 of the Constitution, it is very necessary for our country to formulate and promulgate a regulation on administrative penalties for public security today.

(2) The issues to be addressed by the Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security are minor illegal acts that violate public security management. These minor illegal acts have not reached the level of violating the criminal law and are not serious enough to warrant criminal punishment; however, they exceed the limits that can be resolved by general criticism and education and require the execution of certain administrative penalties. Among those who violate public security management and should be punished, some were originally various bad elements. They engage in theft, fraud, obtaining property by deception, indecent assault, molestation of women, disrupting public order, endangering public safety, creating rumors and causing trouble, and other illegal activities. These bad elements are the targets of our dictatorship. Their illegal activities must be subject to dictatorship and must be punished. It is only because their illegal circumstances are relatively minor, not constituting a crime, and not serious enough to warrant criminal punishment that they are given certain administrative penalties. Therefore, in this sense, the Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security are a weapon for the people to exercise dictatorship over various bad elements.

However, there is another situation, which is that among the illegal behaviors that should be punished, many are minor illegal behaviors among the people, or in other words, behaviors among the people that violate state discipline and disrupt public order, such as violating traffic management, violating household registration management, and certain behaviors that endanger public health. The occurrence of these behaviors is sometimes due to errors in ideological awareness; sometimes due to poor moral character; and sometimes due to mistakes in life and work. For these people who violate public security management, because they infringe or harm the interests of the broad masses of the people and public order, they should also be given necessary punishment, and the execution of the punishment has a certain degree of compulsion. Why is it necessary to implement compulsory punishment for a small number of people who violate discipline among the people? Is this in contradiction with the principle of correctly handling contradictions among the people through persuasion and education? Our answer is: there is no contradiction. This is because the people want to organize their own country and maintain the order of their own country. In addition to exercising dictatorship over the enemy, they should also establish the discipline and public order of the people's country. The discipline and public order of the state cannot tolerate anyone undermining them. Therefore, the implementation of state discipline and the implementation of necessary administrative penalties for minor illegal acts by a few people are not only not contradictory to the principle of using persuasive methods rather than oppressive methods to deal with ideological problems and distinguish right from wrong among the people, but are mutually reinforcing. Moreover, the discipline of the people's country is originally based on the conscious and voluntary basis of the broad masses of the people, and the discipline itself is not purely for the purpose of passive punishment, but mainly to achieve the purpose of active education. It should be repeated: the implementation of this regulation on administrative penalties for public security formulated by our country, like the implementation of other laws or administrative orders of the government, must be carried out through full publicity and education. If the reasons are not clearly explained to the people to gain their support, and it is not based on the conscious and voluntary basis of the broad masses of the people, and compulsory is simply understood as a crude oppression that does not require education, it is completely incorrect and will certainly not work. Chairman Mao said in his report at the Supreme State Conference: "Administrative orders issued for the purpose of maintaining social order must also be accompanied by persuasion and education. Relying solely on administrative orders will not work in many cases." We must earnestly abide by this instruction of Chairman Mao.

Now, the socialist consciousness of the people of our country has been greatly improved, and the people abide by discipline and order. We believe that after full publicity and education, the people will understand the importance of state discipline; the people will understand the unity of democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline under our national system; and the people will understand even more that if the order of our country is not good, it will give counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements a gap to carry out destructive activities. Therefore, the vast majority of the people of our country will not only consciously and voluntarily abide by discipline and restrain themselves, but will also support the government in giving due punishment to a small number of people who do not abide by discipline and do not listen to education and persuasion. The people will support and endorse the punishment of illegal acts by bad elements. Because without doing so, social order cannot be maintained, the public interests of the people are not guaranteed, and some bad habits will spread and develop, which is very detrimental to socialist construction. At present, the handling of violations of public security management is generally too lenient, and the masses of the people have expressed great dissatisfaction, blaming the public security organs for their inability to maintain order, which clearly reflects the will of the broad masses of the people. Now that the state has formulated the Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security, we have a correct criterion for handling problems, and the broad masses of the people also have a weapon to fight against those illegal behaviors and behaviors that do not comply with state discipline. It can be predicted that this will play a very important role in further maintaining social order, consolidating state discipline, safeguarding socialist construction, protecting the interests and rights of the broad masses of the people, and educating the people to establish socialist moral concepts and collective concepts.

(3) Our country is a large country, and the situation is complex. The scope of application of the Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security, from an overall perspective, takes into account the commonalities of cities and villages, large cities and medium and small cities, but also appropriately pays attention to the particularity of specific situations. The scope of penalties stipulated in the draft regulations is roughly divided into four categories: the first category is disrupting public order; the second category is endangering public safety; the third category is infringing on citizens' personal rights; and the fourth category is damaging public and private property. The above four categories, from Articles 5 to 15, have a total of eleven articles and sixty-eight clauses. These clauses basically summarize the behaviors that currently need to be given administrative penalties for public security. The main part of these clauses reflects the common characteristics of cities and villages and is applicable in both cities and villages. For example, stealing, defrauding, and encroaching on small amounts of property, molesting women, gambling, beating others, violating household registration management, and organizing mass gatherings while neglecting safety. A part of it is roughly only applicable to rural areas, such as injuring livestock, damaging crops, privately burning mountains, burning wasteland, and felling other people's or cooperatives' forests, etc.

Is it necessary to implement administrative penalties for public security in the vast rural areas? We believe it is also necessary. In rural areas, cases that endanger social security and harm public interests are not uncommon, and some have directly affected the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives and affected the production and life of the masses. Some cases have caused great dissatisfaction among the masses because the government has not handled them properly. Some even simply take matters into their own hands, which has resulted in some chaos. Therefore, in rural areas, all those who should be punished must be given appropriate punishment. Moreover, as long as we carry out full mass work, rely on the conscious and voluntary nature of the broad masses of peasants, rely on the support of the broad masses of peasants to manage bad elements, and rely on the support of the majority to restrain the behavior of a very small number of people who infringe on the interests of others and disrupt public order, it will definitely be able to be smoothly promoted.

There are also a few articles that are only applicable in cities. For example, disrupting the order of stations, docks, and parks, and arbitrarily emitting loud noises, etc. These cannot be taken to rural areas for implementation. As for the punishment of behaviors that violate traffic management, it is now generally only applicable to large and medium-sized cities, not only not applicable in rural areas, but also not applicable in small cities that have not yet implemented traffic management. Therefore, in the implementation, it cannot be mechanically applied. If it is done uniformly regardless of the specific situation, it is certainly wrong.

(4) The boundaries that should be grasped in the execution of punishment. First of all, the boundaries between administrative penalties for public security and criminal punishments should be strictly distinguished. The names of certain articles in the Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security are the same as the names of certain articles in the Criminal Law, such as theft and fraud. However, the difference between them and the Criminal Law is mainly that the circumstances are relatively minor, the harm is not so serious, and it is not enough to warrant criminal punishment. In order to correctly grasp this boundary and avoid giving only administrative penalties for public security to those who should be subject to criminal punishment; or erroneously pursuing criminal responsibility for those who should only be subject to administrative penalties for public security, it is necessary to conduct a concrete analysis of each case and adopt a serious and cautious attitude.

Secondly, it should also be distinguished from the boundaries of criticism and education. Some articles in this regulation are similar to general criticism and education, such as insulting others, setting up stalls on the streets, piling up objects, and obstructing traffic, etc., but there is also a difference between the two, which is: the behavior that should be punished must have already produced certain adverse consequences, or does not listen to dissuasion, or repeatedly violates the rules despite repeated warnings. As for erroneous behaviors that have not reached this level, and problems that can be solved by criticism and education without punishment, of course, punishment should not be adopted.

Thirdly, the punishments stipulated in the regulations are divided into three types: warning, fine, and detention. To ensure that the punishment is appropriate, it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the specific circumstances of the behavior that violates public security management, the magnitude of the impact, and the attitude of the person being punished, etc., to prevent one-sided and hasty handling. Some people can be given a lighter punishment or exempted from punishment, and some people can also be given a heavier punishment, or sent to labor re-education after punishment. These are all specified in special articles in the regulations.

(5) Control of approval and procedures for adjudication. The regulations stipulate that in rural areas, the adjudication of detention or punishment is controlled by the county public security bureau. Detention of less than five days is entrusted to the township and town people's committees or public security police stations for adjudication due to inconvenient transportation and difficulty in traveling back and forth, and it can be replaced by workdays. This is stipulated according to the specific conditions in rural areas of our country. In cities, the adjudication of detention and fines is controlled by the city public security bureau and public security sub-bureaus, and only the punishment of warning is given to the public security police stations for adjudication. We believe that this provision is more appropriate.

The procedures for adjudication stipulated in the regulations not only reflect the due seriousness of the law but also guarantee the right of appeal for those being punished. At the same time, because cases that violate public security management are generally relatively simple, the situation is easy to clarify, and it is possible to handle them quickly, and if they are not handled for a long time, they will lose their educational significance. Therefore, the adjudication procedures should be simplified as much as possible to facilitate execution. In addition, for cases adjudicated by the county and city public security bureaus, the regulations stipulate that after the person being punished files an appeal, the county and city public security bureaus will still review it. Because sending these appealed cases to the provincial and prefectural public security organs for review is neither practically necessary nor easy to delay matters back and forth. The handling of such cases falls within the scope of administrative power, and we consider it unnecessary to hand over appeals to the procuratorate. Of course, if public security personnel have illegal behaviors that violate the regulations and abuse their powers, the procuratorial organs should supervise them in accordance with the law.

(6) Implementing the mass line. When implementing the Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security, we must rely on the broad masses of the people, and for the part that requires the people to abide by state discipline, we must resolutely implement the spirit of persuasion and education. To this end, we should widely conduct publicity and education among the masses, using forms such as newspapers, radio, books, films, operas, and blackboards to deeply penetrate into organs, organizations, schools, enterprises, streets, and rural areas, and repeatedly publicize to the masses the significance of the Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security, the constitution and laws, and that abiding by state discipline, public order, and respecting social morality are the glorious obligations of every citizen. We should repeatedly explain to the masses of the people what behaviors violate public security management? Call on the masses of the people to consciously abide by them, not to violate them, and to urge others to abide by them. Call on the masses of the people to supervise bad people and not allow bad people to disrupt order. Public security organs at all levels should frequently listen to the opinions of the masses of the people, conscientiously examine and overcome the shortcomings and deviations in their work, educate cadres and police officers, strictly abide by laws and discipline, and neither cover up nor condone those who violate public security management, nor use their powers to abuse punishment. When implementing the Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security, all illegal and undisciplined behaviors of cadres and police officers must be seriously dealt with in accordance with the law.

(7) The Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security involve a wide range. Although it reflects the current basic situation of national public security management and has eight years of work experience as its basis, the content cannot be very perfect. In order to take this situation into account, we have stipulated in Article 31: For violations of public security management that are not listed in this regulation, penalties can be given by analogy with similar articles after being reported to and approved by the city and county people's committees. We believe that it is necessary to give the city and county people's committees such a certain degree of flexibility.

We have widely solicited the opinions of comrades from various provinces and cities on this draft, and repeatedly studied and revised it in conjunction with relevant central departments, and submitted it to the 57th plenary meeting of the State Council for discussion and approval on September 6, 1957. Is it appropriate? Please review it by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

### 关于中华人民共和国治安管理处罚条例草案的说明

专栏：

    关于中华人民共和国治安管理处罚条例草案的说明
    中华人民共和国公安部部长　罗瑞卿委员长、各位副委员长、各位委员：
    现在我就治安管理处罚条例草案中的几个问题，作以下一些说明：
      （一）治安管理处罚条例是在我国经过五大运动和三大改造，社会主义革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，人民要求进一步巩固社会主义建设秩序的情况下提出的。我们的人民民主政权是巩固的，社会秩序是安定的，这显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性；显示了我们国家所进行的五大运动和三大改造的伟大成就；也表现了勤劳勇敢的中国人民的政治觉悟和组织性纪律性。但是，要进一步巩固社会主义建设秩序，要给人民创造更好的工作、学习和生活的环境，我们还要做很多的工作。加强治安管理，同一切不守秩序、不守纪律、损害人民利益、败坏公共道德的行为作斗争，乃是我们很多工作中的一个方面。中华人民共和国建立才八年，而伟大的社会主义改造，去年才基本上完成，新的社会主义制度还有许多人感到不习惯，改变这种状况，需要全体人民一个较长的自我教育过程和觉悟过程。特别是旧社会遗留下来的各种坏分子，以及损人利己、不劳而获、败坏道德等剥削阶级的坏思想、坏习惯、坏作风，还时时刻刻都在对人民中某些不觉悟的分子或者意志薄弱品质不好的分子发生影响，都在对新社会起着腐蚀和破坏作用。这就说明了在社会主义社会里，其所以仍然存在着妨害公共秩序、败坏社会公德的现象，是有它的社会根源的。从思想根源上看，我国虽然已经基本上实现了对生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，但是，在人们头脑中正在进行的政治上和思想上的社会主义改造，还远没有完成。有些人现在仍然保持着资产阶级损人利己、不讲公德、不遵守公共秩序的恶习，许多违反治安管理的行为，就是这种个人主义思想同集体主义思想相抵触的表现。为了进一步保护人民的利益，保障社会主义建设的秩序，我们必须在加强思想教育工作的同时，对一些扰乱公共秩序、妨害公共安全、侵犯公民人身权利、损害公私财产等违反法纪、败坏道德的行为，实行必要的强制性的行政处罚。这是广大人民群众的共同愿望，也是当前进一步巩固社会治安工作中的迫切要求。根据这些理由，根据宪法第四十九条十二项和第一百条的精神，我们国家在今天制定并公布一个治安管理处罚条例，就是十分必要的了。
      （二）治安管理处罚条例所要对待的问题，是属于违反治安管理的轻微的违法行为。这种轻微的违法行为，还不到触犯刑法的程度，够不上给予刑事处分；但又超过了一般批评教育所能解决的限度，需要执行一定的行政处罚。在这些违反治安管理应当受到处罚的人中，有一部分人原来就是各种坏分子。他们进行偷窃、诈骗财物，猥亵调戏妇女，扰乱公共秩序，妨害公共安全，造谣生事等等违法活动。这些坏分子，是我们专政的对象。对他们的违法活动，是必须实行专政，必须加以处罚的。只是因为他们违法的情节比较轻微，还没有构成犯罪，还不够给予刑事处分，所以才给以一定的行政处罚。因此，在这个意义上说，治安管理处罚条例是人民对各种坏分子实行专政的一个武器。
    但是，还有另外一种情形，这就是在应当处罚的违法行为中，还有许多却是属于人民中某些轻微的违法行为，或者说，是属于人民中某些违反国家纪律、妨害公共秩序的行为，例如违反交通管理、违反户口管理、妨害公共卫生的某些行为等等。这些行为的发生，有些是因为思想意识上有错误；有些是道德作风上不好；有些是因为生活上工作上犯了过失。对于这些违反治安管理的人，因为他们侵犯或者妨害广大人民群众的利益和公共秩序，所以也要给以必要的处罚，而处罚的执行，又带有一定的强制性。为什么对人民中间少数违反纪律的人，一定要实行带强制性的处罚呢？这同用说服教育的方法去正确处理人民内部问题的原则，是否有矛盾呢？我们的回答是：没有矛盾。这是因为人民要组织自己的国家，要维持好自己国家的秩序，除了对敌人必须实行专政外，同时，还应该树立起人民国家的纪律和公共秩序。而国家的纪律和公共秩序，是不能容忍任何人来损害的。所以说，国家纪律的实行，对于少数人的轻微的违法行为，实行必要的行政处罚，这是同用说服的方法而不是用压服的方法去处理人民内部的思想问题和辨别是非的原则，不仅不相违背，而且是相辅相成的。何况人民国家的纪律，本来就是建立在广大人民自觉自愿的基础上，纪律的本身又不单纯是为了消极的处罚，而主要的还是为了达到积极教育的目的。应当重复说明：我们国家制定的这个治安管理处罚条例的贯彻实行，也和其他法令或者政府的行政命令的实行一样，必须通过充分的宣传教育，如果不向人民把道理讲清楚，取得他们的拥护和支持，不建立在广大人民自觉自愿的基础上，即把强制简单了解为不需要进行教育的粗暴的压迫，那是完全不正确的，也是一定行不通的。毛主席在最高国务会议上的报告中说：“为着维持社会秩序的目的而发布的行政命令，也要伴之以说服教育，单靠行政命令，在许多情况下就行不通。”毛主席这个指示，我们必须切实遵守。
    现在，我国人民的社会主义觉悟已经大大提高，人民是遵守纪律、遵守秩序的。我们相信：经过充分的宣传教育，人民会懂得国家纪律的重要性；人民会懂得在我们国家制度下的民主和集中、自由和纪律的统一性；人民更会懂得如果我们国家的秩序不好，就将给反革命分子和坏分子以进行破坏活动的空隙。因此，我国人民的绝大多数，不仅会自觉自愿的遵守纪律，约束自己，而且也会赞助政府对于少数不守纪律又不听教育劝告的人，给以应得的处罚。对于坏分子的违法行为给以处罚，人民更是会赞助、会拥护的。因为不如此，社会秩序是维持不好的，人民的公共利益是没有保障的，而且有些坏的风气，还会蔓延发展起来，这对于社会主义建设是十分不利的。目前，对于违反治安管理行为的处理，一般是失之偏轻，人民群众已经表示了很大的不满，责备治安管理机关维持秩序的无能，这就很清楚地反映了广大人民的意愿。现在国家制定了治安管理处罚条例，我们就有了正确处理问题的准则，广大人民群众也有了同那些违法行为和不遵守国家纪律的行为作斗争的一个武器，可以预料，这对于我们进一步维护社会秩序，巩固国家纪律，保卫社会主义建设，保卫广大人民的利益和权利，教育人民树立社会主义的道德观念和集体观念，都将起十分重要的作用。
      （三）我们国家是个大国，情况是复杂的。治安管理处罚条例适用的范围，从总的方面看，照顾了城市和农村，大城市和中、小城市的共同性，但也适当地注意了具体情况的特殊性。条例草案规定处罚的范围，大致分为四类：第一类是扰乱公共秩序的；第二类是妨害公共安全的；第三类是侵犯公民人身权利的；第四类是损害公、私财产的。以上四类，从第五条至十五条，共十一条、六十八款。这些条款基本上概括了目前需要给以治安管理处罚的行为。其中主要部分反映了城市和农村的共同特点，在城市、农村都是适用的。例如偷盗、诈骗、侵占少量财物，调戏妇女，进行赌博，殴打他人，违反户口管理，组织群众集会忽视安全等等。一部分是大体上只适用于农村的，例如伤害牲畜、损坏农作物、私自烧山、烧荒、砍伐他人或合作社的林木等等。
    广大农村是否需要实行治安管理处罚呢？我们认为也是需要的。在农村中，妨害社会治安、危害公共利益的案件并不很少，有的已经直接影响农业生产合作社的巩固和发展，影响群众的生产和生活。有些案件，由于政府没有适当处理，群众很有意见。有的甚至干脆就自己动手来处理，其结果就引起了某些混乱。所以在农村凡是应该处罚的，也一定要给以适当的处罚。而且只要经过充分的群众工作，依靠广大农民的自觉自愿，依靠广大农民的支持来管理坏分子，依靠多数人的支持来约束极少数人侵犯他人利益扰害公共秩序的行为，是一定能够顺利推行的。
    还有少数条文只是在城市中适用的。例如扰乱车站、码头、公园秩序，任意发放高大声响等等。这些就不能拿到农村去执行。至于违反交通管理行为的处罚，现在一般只适用于大、中城市，不仅在农村不适用，在尚未实行交通管理的小城市，也不适用。因此，在执行中不能生搬硬套，如果不问具体情况一律照办，当然是不对的。
      （四）执行处罚中应该掌握的界限。首先，应当同刑事处分的界限严格加以区别。治安管理处罚的某些条款同刑法某些条款的罪名是相同的，例如偷窃、诈骗等。但它同刑法的区别，主要是情节比较轻微，危害没有那样严重，还不够给以刑事处分。为了正确掌握这个界限，避免把应该受到刑事处分的，只给以治安管理处罚；或者把只应该受到治安管理处罚的，错误地追究了刑事责任，就必须对于每一个案件进行具体的分析，并且采取既严肃又谨慎的态度。
    其次，还应当同批评教育的界限相区别。这个条例的某些条款同一般的批评教育也有相似之处，例如辱骂他人、在街道上摆摊、堆物、阻碍交通等，但两者之间也是有区别的，这就是：应该受到处罚的行为，必须是已经产生了一定的恶果，或者不听制止，或者屡戒屡犯。至于没有达到这种程度的错误行为，不用处罚而用批评教育可以解决问题的，当然就不应当采用处罚。
    第三，条例中规定的处罚，分警告、罚款、拘留三种。要做到处罚适当，必须根据违反治安管理行为的具体情节、影响大小和受处罚人的认错态度等等情况，全面地加以分析，防止片面和草率处理。有些人可以从轻处罚或免予处罚，有些人也可以加重处罚，或者处罚后送去劳动教养。这些在条例中都有专门条款作了规定。
      （五）批准的控制和裁决的程序。条例中规定：在农村，拘留或处罚的裁决控制在县公安局。五天以下的拘留，因为交通不便，往返困难，委托给乡、镇人民委员会或公安派出所裁决，并且可以用劳动日来代替，这是根据我国农村的具体情况规定的。在城市，拘留和罚款的裁决控制在市公安局和公安分局，只把警告的处罚交给公安派出所裁决。我们以为，这样规定是比较适当的。
    条例中规定的裁决的程序，既反映了法律应有的严肃性，又保障了受处罚人的申诉权利。同时，因为违反治安管理的案件，情节一般比较简单，容易弄清情况，有可能迅速处理，而且时间久了不作处理，就会失去教育意义。因此，裁决程序力求简便，利于执行。此外，县、市公安局裁决的案件，受处罚人提出申诉后，规定仍由县、市公安局复核。因为把这些申诉案件送到省、专公安机关复核，既无实际必要，也容易往返误事。这种案件的处理，是属于行政职权的范围，交给检察院处理申诉，我们考虑也是没有必要的。当然，如果公安人员有违反条例滥用职权的违法行为，检察机关应当依照法律进行监督。
    （六）实行群众路线。在执行治安管理处罚条例的时候，必须依靠广大群众，对于要求人民遵守国家纪律这一部分说来，必须坚决贯彻说服教育的精神。为此目的，就应当在群众中广泛地进行宣传教育，通过报纸、广播、书刊、影片、戏曲、黑板报等形式，深入到机关、团体、学校、企业、街道和农村，向群众反复宣传治安管理处罚条例的意义，宣传遵守宪法和法律，宣传遵守国家纪律，遵守公共秩序，尊重社会公德是每一个公民光荣的义务。应当反复向人民群众解释什么是违反治安管理的行为？号召人民群众自觉遵守，不要违反，并且督促别人遵守。号召人民群众监督坏人，不容许坏人破坏秩序。各级公安机关应当经常听取人民群众的意见，认真检查和克服工作中的缺点和偏差，教育干部和民警，严守法纪，既不包庇、放纵违反治安管理的人，也不利用职权，滥施处罚。在执行治安管理处罚条例的时候，对于干部和民警的一切违法乱纪行为，都必须依法严肃处理。
    （七）治安管理处罚条例牵涉范围很广，虽然它体现了当前国家治安管理的基本情况，并有了八年的工作经验作为依据，但是，内容还不可能十分完善。为了照顾到这种情况，我们在第三十一条中规定：凡本条例没有列举的违反治安管理行为，可以比照类似的条款，报经市、县人民委员会批准后给以处罚，我们认为给市、县人民委员会这样一定的机动权限是必要的。
    这个草案，我们曾经广泛地征求过各省市同志的意见，又会同中央有关部门反复地进行研究和修改，并且于1957年9月6日提交国务院第五十七次全体会议讨论通过。是否妥当？请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审议。
