Turning Back from the Wrong Road
		Deng Maosen Chen Yongjin

The tide of the socialist great debate, along with autumn, has arrived in the坝区 (baqu) and mountain villages of Qujing. Whether during the day or night, whether at the village entrance or in the ripe rice fields, everywhere is filled with the sound of the socialist great debate.

On the evening of the 18th, the deputy director of the commune notified Zhou Benqing to attend a meeting, asking him to reiterate his opinion at the meeting that "implementing the 'three fixings for grain'" means "the stuffed die of stuffing, and the starved die of starvation." At the meeting, Zhou Benqing said: "I dare not say that the three fixings for grain and unified purchase and sale are bad, but there are many people starving right now."

Old man Zhou Pinzheng immediately asked: "Who exactly is starving? Our Wangsantun Agricultural Cooperative had a ration of 490 catties per person last year, which has exceeded the national standard for grain retention. My family has the same number of people as yours, and we are both surplus grain households, yet we are short of grain. I have lived for over seventy years and have never seen any dynasty manage grain so well."

Zhou Honghua said to Zhou Benqing: "Is the cooperative making you work on an empty stomach?"

Zhou Benqing found it difficult to say that anyone was working on an empty stomach, so he just stubbornly said: "I dare not say the government's policies are bad, but it's not fun to work if grain isn't distributed according to work points." Then Zhou Benqing looked at the people in the meeting place and hypocritically said, "It's enough to have enough grain to eat, what do you want more for?"

Someone in the meeting place continued his words: "To sell it on the black market!"

Ma Pinghai stood up from the crowd and said: "In June, we went to the city together, and you were carrying a bag of grain. I asked you what kind of grain you were carrying, and you said it was wheat. I touched it, and it was rice. I asked how much it cost per catty, and you said it sells for four yuan for ten catties in the city, but since we are from the same cooperative, we'll make it three yuan and four jiao per sheng. Isn't making money like that taking the capitalist road?"

Zhou Benqing said, "Is selling the grain that the cooperative distributed to me also taking the capitalist road?"

At this time, several people stood up and asked: "Where did the grain he sold come from?"

Zhou Benqing said in a panic: "It was bought with the money I earned from selling firewood in Malong County."

"The cooperative's grain is nine jiao and one fen for ten catties, and you sell it for so much money, isn't that the capitalist ideology of exploitation?" Someone asked Zhou Benqing.

"There are many people selling rice on the market, not just me alone," Zhou Benqing said again.

"No matter how many people sell on the black market, anyone who is single-mindedly trying to speculate and take advantage is taking the capitalist road," someone replied.

The meeting place was silent for a long time, and Zhou Benqing finally said: "I have taken the capitalist road, don't you all learn from me."

Zhou Honghua said: "Look at Zhou Benlong, a prosperous middle peasant in our team. He went into business, and no one took care of his wife when she gave birth. She went to her uncle's house to give birth, but her uncle wouldn't allow it, so she had to build a shed outside to give birth, and later she became ill and her eyes went blind, and she went crazy. Think about it, is it better to take the capitalist road, or the socialist road!"

At this time, it was late at night, and the meeting ended.

However, Zhou Benqing's thinking had not truly resolved the problem. Later, his own nephew Zhou Hongju continued to help him clear his mind, inspiring him to say: "If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party this year, if it weren't for cooperativization, we don't know how many people would have starved to death here!"

"I think it's better to return the land to its original owners, and the women to their former husbands," Zhou Benqing said impatiently.

"Don't talk nonsense, without cooperativization, even you would have starved this year."

"You're really something, you even dare to say that your uncle is confused."

Zhou Hongju saw Zhou Benqing's awkward appearance, and knew that arguing with him further would lead to a fight, so he reported his erroneous remarks to the commune director that day.

The next day, while the activists were preparing how to continue the debate, Zhou Benqing secretly lay down in the production team's office pretending to sleep. When they talked about his "returning the land to its original owners, and the women to their former husbands," he grunted and sat up. The deputy director of the commune said: "Since he is here, let's debate it again!"

Zhou Hongju said: "Do you remember! In 1942, there was a drought here, and nine out of seventeen households in our Gejiatun fled. At that time, you were so hungry that you went to the mountains to dig wild melons to eat. Now that the cooperative has been established, your family has a surplus of grain, and you still stubbornly say that the cooperative is making you work on an empty stomach. Are you right to say that?"

Zhou Benqing said angrily: "If you hadn't reported it, the commune wouldn't have known!"

Zhou Hongju said: "My reporting is to help you progress, to help you stop going down the wrong road."

Zhou Kaiming said: "What do you mean by 'returning the land to its original owners, and the women to their former husbands'?"

That day, they argued until late at night, and Zhou Benqing finally stubbornly remained silent.

Many people were worried about Zhou Benqing, feeling that he was going down the wrong road just when his life was getting better, and they were all willing to help him turn back from the wrong road. Therefore, on the 26th, it rained, making it difficult to produce, and another ten or so people from the commune started a debate with him about his erroneous remarks.

Zhou Chaolian, who was over seventy years old, asked Zhou Benqing: "Does returning the land to its original owners mean you want to disband the cooperative?"

Zhou Benqing said: "I don't mean that, I want to return the land in Guijiatun that was allocated to the Gejiatun Production Team to Guijiatun to cultivate again." However, he still insisted that commune members should only distribute grain according to work points.

Gui Baoming asked Zhou Benqing: "Why do you insist on distributing grain according to work points? If all the grain is distributed, how can we support the country's industrialization? Why is it that your family gets 560 catties of grain per person, yet you are still short of grain?"

"Zhou Benqing, how old are you?" Old man Zhou Chaolian asked.

"Over fifty years old."

"You are over fifty years old, and your youngest son is still young. It won't be long before you will also enjoy the 'five guarantees.' According to what you say, if grain is distributed entirely according to work points, those who are on the five guarantees will starve to death. In a few years, when you can't work anymore, you will also starve to death."

"I'm wrong, I'm wrong, in a few years I really won't be able to work anymore."

"Do you remember the year of the drought, how many families in our village sold their children? Do you remember how many people starved to death?" Zhou Hongju asked.

It seemed that this question touched Zhou Benqing's heart. He looked at everyone with tears in his eyes and said: "That year my mother died, and I didn't have money to buy a coffin, so I had to bury her temporarily at the head of the village. That year, several people did starve to death. When you mention it, I remember it. Cooperativization is better."

Gui Baozhong said: "If it weren't for cooperativization, who knows how many people would have starved to death this year? It hasn't been this dry in decades. After cooperativization, everyone's life is better than in the past, but you want to return the land to its original owners again."

"I have made mistakes and will definitely make a self-criticism. It's just that some of the opinions that everyone has raised are not what I said," Zhou Benqing said, trying to shirk responsibility.

Miao Shunhe, the secretary of the general branch, said: "Zhou Benqing, if you don't stay close to the Communist Party, you will stay close to landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements; if you don't stay close to the cooperative, you will stay close to individual farming. If you don't move forward, you have to retreat. Everyone knows whether cooperativization is good or not. Let's not talk about anything else, let's just talk about this year's drought! This year is the driest year in decades." Old man Zhou Chaolian interjected again and said: "I have lived for over seventy years and have never seen such a dry year." Miao Shunhe continued: "In the 1942 drought, dozens of people starved to death in just these few villages in Wangsantun, and about thirty families sold their children." Gui Baozhong said: "My family alone sold three. Without the Communist Party, without the cooperative, with this drought this year, wouldn't we have to sell our children again!" Miao Shunhe said: "Even with this drought this year, our Wangsantun Agricultural Cooperative will still increase production by 60,000 catties of grain. The reason is that the government helped our commune build two large reservoirs, and we planted over 4,000 mu of rice before Mangzhong. These early-planted rice can yield over 800 catties per mu. Before liberation, it only yielded three or four hundred catties. Every year, each person only got about 200 catties of grain. Last year, your commune got 502 catties per person. The eighty-four grain-deficient households also got 380 catties per person. Could this be done without the Communist Party, without cooperativization? One must never forget the bitter days of the past, forgetting one's roots leads to making mistakes!"

    从错路上转回来邓茂森　陈勇进
    社会主义大辩论的浪潮，和秋天一起来到了曲靖的坝区和山谷的村庄里。不管在白天和夜间，不管在村头和成熟的稻田里，到处都是社会主义大辩论的声音。
    18日这天晚上，社里副主任通知周本清开会，叫他在会上向大家重新说说“实行粮食三定”就是“撑死的撑死、饿死的饿死”的意见。周本清在会上说：我不敢说粮食三定和统购统销不好，可是眼前就有很多人饿着。
    周品正老汉马上问： “到底谁家饿着啦？我们王三屯农业社去年口粮每人都合到四百九十斤，已经超过了国家规定的留粮标准。我家和你家的人口一样多，又都是余粮户，还闹缺粮。我活了七十多岁，没见过那个朝代管粮食管得这样好。”
    周洪华对周本清说：“合作社里是不是叫你饿着肚子干活啦？”
    周本清很难说出有那个人饿着肚子干活的，只是强拿捏着说：“政府的政策我不敢说不好，就是不按工分分粮食，做活没趣味。”接着周本清看了看会场上的人们又假惺惺地说：“粮食够吃就行了，多要干什么？”
    会场上有人接着他的话说：“多要粮食搞黑市嘛！”
    马平海从人群里站出来说：“6月间，咱们一块进城，你背着一袋子粮食。我问你背的什么粮食，你说是麦子。我一摸，是大米。我问多少钱一斤，你说城里卖四块钱十斤，咱们是一个社里的，就按三元四角一升好了。你赚钱这样狠，不叫走资本主义的路吗？”
    周本清说：“社上分给我的粮食，卖了也叫走资本主义的路吗？”
    这时，有几个人站起来问：他卖的粮食是从哪里来的？
    周本清慌张地说：“是在马龙县贩柴赚的钱买的。”
    “社里的粮食是九角一分钱十斤，你卖那样多钱，是不是资本主义的剥削思想？”有人问周本清。
    “到市场上卖米的人多得很，不光我一个人。”周本清又说。
    “不管有多少人卖黑市，一心想投机取巧的，都是走资本主义的路。”有人回答他说。
    会场上沉默了好久，周本清才说：“我是走了资本主义的路，大家别学我。”
    周洪华说：“你看看我们队上的富裕中农周本龙，他去作生意，他老婆生孩子没人管，到他舅舅家生，他舅爹又不准，只好搭个窝棚在外边生，后来生病眼睛瞎了，人也疯了。你想想，到底是走资本主义的路好，还是走社会主义的路好！”
    这时，已到深夜了，会散了。
    但是，周本清的思想上并没有真正解决问题。后来，他的亲侄子周洪举又继续帮助他打通思想，启发他说：“今年要不是共产党领导，要不是合作化，咱们这里还不知饿死多少人哩！”
    “我看还是田归原主，女奔前夫好。”周本清不耐烦地说。
    “你莫要昏说，没有合作化，今年连你也得饿起来。”
    “你真了不起，还敢说叔叔昏哩。”
    周洪举看周本清那别扭样子，再和他辩论起来，就会打架，于是当天就把他的错误言论报告给社主任了。
    第二天，积极分子正在准备如何继续进行辩论，周本清却偷偷地躺在生产队的办公室里装睡觉。当谈到他的“田归原主，女奔前夫”的时候，他就哼了一声坐起来了。社里副主任说：“既然他在这里，就再辩论辩论吧！”
    周洪举说：“你记得吧！1942年咱们这里闹旱灾，我们戈家屯十七户就逃走了九户。那时候你饿的到山上挖野瓜吃。现在成立了合作社，你家的粮食有余了，你还硬说合作社叫你饿着肚子干活。你这样说对不对？”
    周本清气愤地说：“要不是你汇报，社上还不知道哩！”
    周洪举说：“我汇报是帮助你进步，是帮助你不再走错路。”
    周开明说：“你说田归原主、女奔前夫是啥意思？”
    这天，又争论到深夜，周本清最后固执着不吭气了。
    很多人都为周本清耽心，觉得他日子刚过好，就往错误的路上走，都愿意帮助他从错路上转过来。因此，26日这天下雨，不好生产，社里又有十来个人和他那些错误言论展开了辩论。
    七十多岁的周朝连问周本清：“田归原主，是不是想把合作社解散？”
    周本清说：“我不是那个意思，是想把桂家屯拨到戈家屯生产队的土地，再归桂家屯种。”可是，他还坚持社员应当光按工分来分粮食。
    桂保明问周本清：“你为什么要坚持按工分分粮食。把粮食都分掉，怎么支援国家工业化建设？为什么你家每人分到五百六十斤粮食，还闹缺粮？”
    “周本清，你年纪多大了？”周朝连老汉问。
    “五十多岁了。”
    “你五十多岁了，你的小儿子又小，要不了多少年你就也要享受‘五保’。照你说的，全按工分分粮食，五保户都要饿死。再有几年你劳动不动了，连你也要饿死。”
    “我不对，我错了，再有几年我确实也劳动不动了。”
    “你记得那年旱灾时，咱们村上有几家卖孩子的吗？你记得饿死几个人吗？”周洪举问。
    看来，这个问题打动了周本清的心，他眼泪汪汪地看着大家说：“那年我母亲死了，没钱买棺材，只好暂时安葬在村头上。那年确实饿死好几个人。你们一提，我就记起来啦。还是合作化好。”
    桂保重说：“要是没有合作化，今年还不知要饿死多少人？几十年没像今年这样旱。合作化后，大家的日子比过去好了，你却又要田归原主。”
    “我有错误，一定检讨。就是大家提的意见，有些不是我说的。”周本清推托着说。
    总支书记缪顺和说：“周本清，你不离共产党近，就离地富坏分子近；你不离合作社近，就离单干近。你不前进就得后退。合作化到底好不好，大家都知道。别的不说，就说今年的旱灾吧！今年是几十年没有的干旱年成。”周朝连老汉又插嘴说：“我活了七十多岁了，还没见过这样的干旱年景。”缪顺和又接着说：“1942年旱灾，光王三屯这几个村庄就饿死几十个人，卖孩子的就有三十来家。”桂保重说：“光我家就卖掉三个。没有共产党，没有合作社，今年这干旱年景，还不是要卖孩子！”缪顺和说：“今年这样旱，咱们王三屯农业社还要增产六万斤粮食。原因是政府帮助我们社里修了两个大水库，在芒种前就种下了四千多亩稻子。这些早种的稻子每亩能收八百多斤。解放前，才收个三几百斤。每年每人才合到二百多斤粮食。去年你们社里每人就合到五百零二斤。八十四户缺粮户，每人也合到三百八十斤。这，离了共产党、离了合作化能办得到吗？一个人千万不能忘了过去的苦日子，忘了本就要犯错误！”
