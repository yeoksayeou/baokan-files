"Such is Life"
——Literary Appreciation Essay
	Wang Chaowen

The Italian film "Such is Life" consists of five short stories. In terms of plot, each story is independent, with different forms of expression and tones, and varying degrees of thematic clarity. However, their combination is not accidental; they are not randomly pieced-together fragments of life without internal connections. They are unified by this characteristic: the condemnation by conscientious artists of the causes that create this kind of life.

This film has a power that compels the audience to think about the reasons for people's unhappiness after seeing it. The film does not directly draw conclusions for the stories, but only provides the audience with materials, facts, and clues related to the conclusions. Perhaps it is precisely because the film guides the audience to care about the conclusions without directly stating them that the audience is eager to understand the reasons for such unhappy lives, thereby understanding what the film condemns.

The characters in these stories, let's just talk about the women, have very different personalities and experiences: a young girl ("Mara Girl") who keenly feels the importance of making money due to her impoverished life, disregards her own exploitation, and does not believe in true love; a mother ("The Abandoned Child") who has to abandon her own baby but is reluctant to do so, and cannot overcome her inner contradictions, appearing mentally unstable; an out-of-date noblewoman ("Sunset is Infinitely Good," originally "Production Exterior") who, for the sake of bread, can only be used as "atmosphere-enhancing background activity" in costume films, constantly subjected to contemptuous atmosphere; an old woman ("Better Off Dead") who wants to end her undesirable life of poverty, hardship, and loneliness by committing suicide, but fears that she will not receive God's exceptional forgiveness; and a young girl ("Grandpa Colletti") who "grew up in bombs, tears, poverty, and gloomy faces," keenly feels the value of love, and pursues it regardless of everything. These women have different personalities and very different circumstances, but the root cause of their unhappiness is the same. What is the reason? The film does not say it directly, but it is already contained in the specific characters and actions.

If every story had the same atmosphere, the audience would inevitably feel bored. The five short plays have different backgrounds and different atmospheres. Some are very gloomy, while others are very relaxed. The background for Mara Girl's love affair is the post-war ruins, which are very inconsistent with love, rough American military vehicles and soldiers, and music with a hideous color that makes people feel uneasy. The background for the abandoned child is the repeated appearance of various churches and hypocritical "servants of God." The two "background characters" in the film studio are in an atmosphere of noise, coldness, and extreme contempt. The desolate gray mountain village, the ignorant old sheep, and the foolish old priest are a completely consistent backdrop for the old woman who feels that life has no meaning. The last story, "Grandpa Colletti," is full of hilarious comedic colors, which can evoke laughter from the audience everywhere. All these differences have not fundamentally changed the tone of the entire film. Even if the last story has a bit too much effect, it also permeates the invisible tears of the protagonist, which can be said to be equivalent to the warm colors that constitute the cold tone in painting. The atmospheres of the five stories are very different, but their backgrounds are basically gloomy, gray, and even terrifying, all of which are related to the questions raised by the entire film.

The endings of these stories are very capable of inducing the audience to think, and they all have the characteristics of "ending without ending." They all end at the stage where the event has come to an end but the problem has not been solved. The honest elementary school teacher finally found his wife who ran away after living together for one night, and the woman did not indicate that she still wanted to run away. However, can precious love change their material environment? Can it guarantee that there will be no shortage of bread and coffee? The not-so-heartless mother who was unwilling to abandon her baby finally took back her own flesh and blood, but can the reasons that forced her to abandon the baby be eliminated? The "old antiques" who have wasted their years and are "covered in dust," when they try to end their lonely lives in old age by getting married and leaving the status of "background activity," will there be unexpected good fortune waiting for them? The old woman who does not quite trust God but does not dare to offend God may no longer plan to end her life early, but has the reason that prompted her to commit suicide—just to live, and the living conditions of living—changed? The girl who pursues love regardless of everything has achieved her goal, which can also be regarded as a "happy ending"; but after she marries the unemployed old driver, can she rely on the driver's "forever smiling eyes" to live? After watching these endless endings, the audience is more eager to know the future of these people who are willing to live meaningfully but are difficult to get rid of unfortunate encounters, and also wants to understand what causes people's unhappiness.

Although this film only depicts some ordinary phenomena, it also has a shocking effect. Although the selected materials are ordinary, they have already demonstrated the unhappiness of people in capitalist society. Including those who once exploited others but can now only be employed by capitalists, these people without money and status are not respected in capitalist society. By thinking about the fate of the characters and the characteristics of their environment, the audience may understand that people's unhappiness is by no means their own fault, but a certain force that does not directly appear in the film. This invisible force binds people more firmly than iron chains. The film does not directly depict those hateful exploiters who build their enjoyment on the suffering of others, but through the complex plot, the audience can understand what dominates people's fate, threatens and tramples on the people, and even forces kind and pure girls to lose the dignity they should have as human beings. The daughter of a worker is by no means born willing to degenerate, and her fear of degeneration is by no means a tragedy of any character, but capitalist society is ruthlessly trampling on people's character. The forces that hurt people's spirit are no less hateful than cruel and barbaric crimes such as murder and rape.

The Italian people do not all live according to the situation in this film. In another film, "Tragic Lovers," another way of life is shown, showing organized and led resistance. Although the typicality of the environment in which the working people in "Such is Life" are in is not sufficient, and it does not make it easier for the audience to understand how people who have the right to live should live, the story in it has relied on the high skills of film art to vividly reflect the lives of kind and ordinary Italian people, and powerfully prompted the audience to want to know the social causes that cause unhappiness to the people. This is a film with art and thought that is worthy of our welcome.

The Chinese people who have lived through suffering will not feel unfamiliar with these shocking scenes. Eight or nine years ago, the vast number of Chinese working people without money or status, like the Italian people, were also spiritually ravaged and destroyed. The public screening of "Such is Life" in China can not only strengthen the Chinese people's understanding of the Italian people, not only strengthen the cultural exchange between the two countries, not only obtain the experience of film art skills, but also be very beneficial to those who do not understand or have forgotten the situation of the old Chinese society.

    “如此人生”
    ——文艺欣赏随笔
    王朝闻
    意大利电影“如此人生”，由五个短小的故事构成。就情节而论，每一个故事都是独立的，表现形式和情调也很有区别，主题的明确程度也不一样，可是它们结合在一起并不偶然，它们不是没有内在联系的随便堆在一起的生活片断，它们统一在这样的特点之上：有良心的艺术家对于造成这种生活的原因的谴责。
    这部电影有一种力量，它迫使观众看过电影之后想寻找造成人们生活不幸的原因。电影没有直接给故事作出结论，只给观众提供了有关结论的材料、事实和线索。也许正因为电影在引导观众关心结论而又不直接说出结论，观众就很想要了解造成生活如此不幸的原因，从而明白电影谴责了什么。
    这些故事里的人物，单说女性吧，性格与遭遇都很不同：穷困的生活使她迫切想到赚钱的重要，不顾自己被糟蹋也不相信真爱情的少女（“玛拉姑娘”）；不得不遗弃亲生的婴孩却又舍不得遗弃，不能克服内心的矛盾而显得精神不大正常的母亲（“弃儿”）；为了面包，只能在古装电影片中被当成“增加气氛的活动背景”使用，经常处在轻蔑气氛之中的过了时的贵妇人（“夕阳无限好”原名“制片外景”）；想要用自杀来结束值不得留恋的贫穷、辛苦和孤独的生活，却又唯恐得不到上帝例外的宽恕的老太婆（“生不如死”）；在“炸弹、眼泪、贫困和阴沉的脸色中长大”，迫切感到爱情的可贵，因而不顾一切地追求爱情的少女（“高拉蒂大爷”）。这些女性的个性不同，处境也很不一样，可是造成她们不幸的根本原因是一致的。是什么原因，电影没有直说，却已经包含在具体的人物和行动之中。
    如果每个故事都是同样的气氛，观众难免觉得腻味。这五个小戏的背景不同，气氛也不同。有的十分阴沉，有的却很轻松。给玛拉姑娘的恋爱作背景的，是和恋爱很不相称的战后的废墟，粗野的美国军车和士兵，具有狞恶色彩、使人感到不安的音乐。给弃儿作背景的，是反复出现的各种教堂和伪善的“上帝的仆人”。在电影摄影场里的那两个
  “背景人物”，处在喧嚣、冷酷和极端轻蔑的气氛之中。荒凉灰色的山村，无知的老羊，愚蠢的老牧师，对于觉得生活没有意义的老妇人，是色彩完全一致的衬托。最后一个故事“高拉蒂大爷”，却充满了引人发笑的喜剧色彩，随处可以引起观众的笑。这一切区别还没有根本改变整部片子的基调。即令最后一个故事未免过多效果，可是其中也渗和着主人公无形的眼泪，也可以说相当于绘画上构成冷调子的热色。五个故事的气氛很不相同，它们的背景基本上都是阴沉的，灰色的，甚至可以说是可怕的，这一切都和整部片子所提出的问题联系着。
    这些故事的结局很能诱导观众进行思索，它们都具有“以不了了之”的特点。都是结束在事件告一段落可是并非问题已经解决的环节。诚实的小学教员终于找到了同居一夜就逃走的妻，女的也没有表示还想要逃走。可是，可贵的爱情能不能改变他们的物质环境？能不能保证面包和咖啡不缺呢？不愿遗弃婴孩的并不狠心的娘，终于抱回自己的亲骨肉，可是不得不遗弃婴孩的原因可能消除吗？虚度年华、“盖满了灰尘”的“老古董”，当他们企图结束暮年孤独生活而结婚，离开了“活动背景”的地位之后，有没有意外的幸运等待他们？并不太信任上帝却也不敢得罪上帝的老妇人，也许不再打算提早结束生命了，可是促使她要自杀的原因——只是为了活下去，而活下去的生活状况——已经改变了吗？不顾一切追求爱情的少女达到了目的，也可算是“大团圆”吧；可是她和失业的老司机结婚之后，能不能依靠司机那一双“永远微笑的眼睛”过日子呢？看了这些没有结局的结局，观众更想要知道这些愿意生活得有意义而又难于摆脱不幸遭遇的人们的未来，而且也更想了解是什么原因造成人们的不幸。
    这部片子虽然只描写一些平常的现象，却也有触目惊心的作用，所选择的材料虽然平凡，已经表现了资本主义社会中的人们的不幸。包括曾经剥削过人而现在却只能给资本家当雇佣的人在内，这些没有金钱和地位的人在资本主义社会中不被尊重，联系着人物的命运及其环境的特点来进行思索，观众可能明白人们之所以不幸决不是人们自己的过失，而是一种不直接在电影上出现的某种力量，这种无形的力量比铁链更牢固地束缚着人们。电影里没有直接描写那些可憎的把自己的享受建筑在别人的痛苦之上的剥削者，可是透过复杂的情节，观众能够体会是什么东西支配着人的命运，威胁和蹂躏着人民，甚至迫使善良的纯洁的少女丧失了做人应有的尊严。工人的女儿决不是天生愿意堕落的，她不怕堕落决不是任何性格的悲剧，而是资本主义社会在无情地蹂躏着人的性格。伤害人的精神的势力，和杀人、强奸等等残酷和野蛮的罪恶比较，不是不可恨的。
    意大利人民不都是按照这部电影上的状况生活着，在另一部电影“苦难情侣”里，就表现了另一方式的生活，表现了有组织有领导的反抗。“如此人生”里的劳动人民所处的环境的典型性虽然还不充分，没有让观众更便于了解有权活下去的人应该怎样活下去，可是其中的故事它已经依靠了电影艺术的高度技巧，生动地反映了善良的普通的意大利人民如此的生活，有力地促使观众想要知道给人民造成不幸的社会原因。这是值得我们欢迎的有艺术也有思想的电影。
    曾经在苦难中生活过来的中国人民，在这些惊心动魄的情景之前不会感到陌生。八、九年之前，广大的没有金钱没有地位的中国劳动人民，和意大利人民一样连精神上也遭到了蹂躏和摧残。“如此人生”在中国公映，不只可以加强中国人民对于意大利人民的了解，不只可以加强两国之间的文化交流，不只可以得到电影艺术上的技巧的借鉴，而且，它对于不太了解或忘记了中国旧社会状况的人也很有益。
