Comrade Ambassador, Dear Comrade Aristov and all comrades of the delegation, comrades and friends:

　　The Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation headed by Comrade Aristov is about to conclude its visit to our country. Tonight, we are especially delighted and happy to have the opportunity to gather with you again.

　　The delegation's visit to our country coincides with the time when our people are celebrating the eighth anniversary of the founding of our country and warmly welcoming the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. During their short stay, the comrades of the delegation visited some important cities in the coastal and inland areas of our country, visited some factories, agricultural production cooperatives, schools, cultural institutions, and urban construction projects, met with workers, peasants, students, and people from all walks of life in our country, and had cordial conversations with leaders at all levels in our country. The delegation brought to the Chinese people the fraternal friendship and good wishes of the great Soviet people, which is not only a great encouragement to the Chinese people in carrying out socialist construction, but also greatly enhanced the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

　　The Soviet Union is a strong fortress for safeguarding world peace and the cause of human progress. The victory of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution opened up the road to human liberation. In the Second World War, the Soviet people, with their unparalleled heroic spirit of self-sacrifice, shouldered the sacred task of defeating the fascist aggressors, saving mankind from fascist enslavement. The Soviet Union has always supported the anti-colonialist struggle, advocated peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between countries with different social systems, and played a great role in the struggle to safeguard world peace. Recently, after the Soviet Union successfully manufactured intercontinental ballistic missiles, it launched the first man-made Earth satellite in human history, creating a new era of conquering space. This is of great significance for defending world peace and promoting human happiness. The Chinese people heartily cheer for this great scientific achievement of the Soviet Union. On behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese people, I extend warm congratulations to the Soviet people.

　　Here I would also like to emphasize: In order to promote the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East region and continue its aggressive conspiracy, U.S. imperialism is currently directing Turkey to prepare for an armed attack on Syria after its series of conspiracies to subvert the Syrian government suffered setbacks. The situation is very serious. This tense situation not only seriously threatens the independence and security of Syria and the countries in the Middle East, but also seriously threatens world peace and security. The Chinese people fully support the recent condemnation and warning of U.S. imperialism and Turkey by Soviet leaders; and firmly support the just struggle of the Syrian people and all Arab people against imperialism and safeguarding national independence. The Chinese people, like the Soviet people, firmly stand on the side of the Syrian people. We believe that the unity of the Syrian people and the strong support of the Arab people and peace-loving people all over the world for Syria's anti-aggression struggle will surely lead to the shameful defeat of the aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. We solemnly warn the U.S. imperialists: If you insist on playing with fire, you will definitely come to no good end!

　　The Chinese and Soviet peoples are the closest brothers and comrades-in-arms. Our two countries, with 800 million people, are advancing shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand in safeguarding world peace and developing the cause of human progress. This friendly and cooperative relationship cannot be hindered by any force and is indestructible and invincible. The Chinese people deeply realize that the victory of the Chinese revolution and the achievements of socialist construction have been achieved along the path of the great October Socialist Revolution. We spare no effort to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in revolution and construction, which has ensured that the Chinese people's cause of liberation and socialist construction will advance from victory to victory. In the future, we will continue to conscientiously learn from the Soviet Union's various advanced experiences and science and technology, so as to realize our country's socialist industrialization and agricultural modernization as quickly as possible and build our country into a prosperous and strong, great socialist country. The great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, forged in the common revolutionary struggle and socialist construction, is deeply rooted and as solid as a rock, which cannot be destroyed by any storm.

　　The brilliance of the October Socialist Revolution shines on the bright road of the world's proletariat and human liberation. Under the illumination of the brilliance of the October Revolution, progressive people all over the world will advance victoriously in safeguarding world peace and developing the cause of human progress.

　　Comrades and friends, I propose:

　　For the great Soviet people to achieve new successes in the cause of building communism and safeguarding world peace,

　　For the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples,

　　For the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,

　　For the unity of all peace-loving countries and people in the world,

　　For the health of today's host - Comrade Ambassador,

　　For the health of Comrade Aristov and all comrades of the delegation,

　　For the health of the leading comrades of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government: Comrade Khrushchev, Comrade Voroshilov, Comrade Bulganin, and Comrade Mikoyan,

　　Cheers!

### 刘少奇委员长的讲话

专栏：

　　刘少奇委员长的讲话亲爱的大使同志，亲爱的阿里斯托夫同志和代表团的全体同志们，同志们、朋友们：
    以阿里斯托夫同志为首的苏联最高苏维埃代表团就要结束在我国的访问了。今天晚上，我们有机会再一次同大家欢聚一堂，感到格外亲切和高兴。
    代表团在我国访问的期间正是我国人民欢度我国建国八周年国庆和热烈地迎接伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候。代表团的同志们在短短的期间里访问了我国沿海和内地的一些重要城市，参观了一些工厂、农业生产合作社、学校、文化机关和城市建设事业，会见了我国的工人、农民、学生和各界人士，同我国各级领导人员进行了亲切的交谈。代表团给中国人民带来了伟大的苏联人民的兄弟的友情和良好的祝愿，这不仅是对中国人民进行社会主义建设的极大鼓舞，而且也大大增进了中苏两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊。
    苏联是维护世界和平和人类进步事业的坚强堡垒。苏联十月社会主义革命的胜利，开辟了人类解放的道路。在第二次世界大战中，苏联人民以无比英勇的自我牺牲的精神，肩负了击败法西斯侵略者的神圣任务，使人类免于法西斯的奴役。苏联一贯支持反殖民主义的斗争，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处、友好合作，在维护世界和平的斗争中起着伟大的作用。最近，苏联在制造洲际弹道导弹成功以后，又发射了人类有史以来的第一颗人造地球卫星，开创了征服空间的新纪元。这对保卫世界和平和促进人类幸福具有十分伟大的意义。中国人民衷心地为苏联这一伟大的科学成就而欢呼。我代表中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民向苏联人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    在这里我还要着重指出：美帝国主义为了在中近东地区推行艾森豪威尔主义，继续进行它的侵略阴谋，在它所策划的颠覆叙利亚政府的一连串阴谋活动遭受失败后，目前正在指使土耳其准备对叙利亚进行武装进攻，局势是很严重的。这一紧张形势不仅严重地威胁了叙利亚和中近东国家的独立和安全，也严重地威胁着全世界的和平和安全。中国人民完全支持苏联领导人最近对美帝国主义和土耳其的谴责和警告；并且坚决地支持叙利亚人民和全体阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立的正义斗争。中国人民和苏联人民一样，是坚决站在叙利亚人民一边的。我们相信，叙利亚人民的团结一致和阿拉伯人民及全世界爱好和平人民对叙利亚反侵略斗争的有力支持，一定将使美帝国主义的侵略阴谋遭到可耻的失败。我们严正警告美帝国主义者：你们如果一定要玩火，那一定是没有好下场的！
    中苏两国人民是最亲密的兄弟和战友。我们两国八亿人民在维护世界和平和发展人类进步事业中肩并肩、手携手地共同前进，这种友好合作关系是没有任何力量可以阻挠的，是无坚不摧、无敌不克的。中国人民深切地认识到，中国革命的胜利和社会主义建设的成就，是沿着伟大十月社会主义革命的道路取得的，我们不遗余力地学习苏联关于革命和建设的先进经验，保证了中国人民的解放事业和社会主义建设事业从胜利走向胜利。今后，我们还要继续认真地学习苏联的各种先进经验和科学技术，以便尽可能迅速地实现我国社会主义的工业化和农业的现代化，把我国建设成为一个繁荣富强的、伟大的社会主义国家。中苏两国人民在共同的革命斗争和社会主义建设事业中结成的伟大友谊根深蒂固、坚如磐石，是任何狂风暴雨不能摧毁的。
    十月社会主义革命的光辉照耀着全世界无产阶级和人类解放的光明大路，全世界的进步人类在十月革命的光辉照耀之下，都将为维护世界和平和发展人类进步事业而胜利前进。
    同志们、朋友们，我提议：
    为伟大的苏联人民在建设共产主义和维护世界和平的事业中获得新的成就，
    为中苏两国人民永恒的牢不可破的兄弟友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，
    为全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结，
    为今天招待会的主人——大使同志的健康，
    为阿里斯托夫同志和代表团全体同志们的健康，
    为苏联共产党、苏联最高苏维埃和苏联政府的领导同志们：赫鲁晓夫同志、伏罗希洛夫同志、布尔加宁同志、米高扬同志的健康，
    干杯！
