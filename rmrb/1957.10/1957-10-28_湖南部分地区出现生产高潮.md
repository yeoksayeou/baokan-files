    Production Upsurge in Parts of Hunan

    (Our Newspaper News) The broad masses of peasants in parts of the Xiangtan and Changde Special Districts and the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province have generally raised their awareness through the socialist great debate, thus setting off a high tide of production.

    So far, these three regions have sown 8 million mu of autumn and winter crops, and more than 10,000 co-ops have launched a large-scale autumn manure accumulation campaign. The 7,960 co-ops in the Xiangtan area have accumulated an average of 21,000 dan of mixed fertilizer per co-op. Recently, about 400,000 farmers in the Changde Special District have been plowing hardpan fields every day. In the Shisong Co-op in Liuyang County, Xiangtan Special District, 94% of the members have distinguished between right and wrong on major issues concerning grain, and many members have consciously formulated grain conservation plans. Five members of this co-op who had previously been consistently unwilling to work have now also made work attendance plans and are actively participating in production.

    湖南部分地区出现生产高潮
    本报讯　湖南省湘潭、常德两专区和湘西土家族苗族自治州的部分地区的广大农民，通过社会主义大辩论，觉悟普遍提高，因而掀起了生产高潮。
    到目前为止，这三个地区已播种了秋冬作物八百万亩，有一万多个社开展了规模巨大的秋季积肥运动，湘潭区的七千九百六十个社，平均每社积了二万一千担混合肥。常德专区最近每天有四十万左右的农民在翻耕板田。湘潭专区浏阳县杉松社94％的社员分清了粮食问题的大是大非，许多社员自觉订立了粮食节约计划。这个社有五个社员过去一贯不爱劳动，现在也订了出工计划，积极参加生产。
