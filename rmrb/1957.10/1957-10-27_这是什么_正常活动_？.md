    October 18th, the Soviet TASS news agency released a statement exposing the war deployment of the United States and Turkey to invade Syria. This made officials in Washington flustered and forced them to come out and try to cover it up.

    On October 19th, an official from the U.S. Department of Defense deliberately told a United Press reporter: "Several American military officers have visited Turkish troops in southern Turkey, but if this is the case, it is a normal activity related to the military assistance the United States provides to Turkey." He added: "Some of them visited Turkish troops because of the recent exercises held in that country—the U.S. Sixth Fleet cooperated with that exercise—which is also normal."

    However, this Washington official could not explain why American military officers had to go to the southern part of Turkey, where Turkish troops were concentrated, to "visit"? Why did the U.S. Sixth Fleet have to conduct exercises in "cooperation" with Turkey precisely when Turkey was preparing to invade Syria? Are these all "normal activities"?

    Coincidentally, on the same day this official spoke, the Associated Press sent a message from Istanbul, which precisely illustrated what the "normal activities" of American military officers were all about. The message stated that people who had recently traveled on the Turkish-Syrian border had personally witnessed a large number of Turkish infantry and armored troops digging trenches there. These Turkish troops were all equipped with American weapons, including rocket launchers and recoilless guns. In this area, travelers saw thirty "American officers and sergeants dressed in field uniforms."

    The matter is very clear: the "normal activities" of American military officers on the Turkish-Syrian border are, in fact, directly commanding and assisting Turkish troops in preparing for an invasion of Syria!

    这是什么“正常活动”？
    10月18日，苏联塔斯社发表声明，揭露了美国和土耳其侵略叙利亚的战争部署。这使华盛顿的官员们感到发慌了，不得不出来加以掩饰。
    10月19日，美国国防部的一个官员故意向合众社记者说：“有几个美国军官曾经访问过在土耳其南部的土耳其部队，但是，如果真是这样的话，这是一种与美国给予土耳其的军事援助有关的正常活动。”他又说：“他们中间有几个人因最近在那个国家举行的演习——美国第六舰队同那个演习进行了合作——而去访问土耳其军队，这也是正常的。”
    但是，这个华盛顿的官员不能解释，为什么美国军官偏偏要到土耳其军队集结的南部去“访问”？为什么美国第六舰队偏偏要在土耳其准备侵略叙利亚的时候同土耳其进行“合作”的演习？难道这都是“正常活动”吗？
    事有凑巧，就在这个官员谈话的同一天，美联社从伊斯坦布尔发了一条消息，它恰恰说明了美国军官的“正常活动”究竟是怎么一回事。这条消息说，最近在土耳其—叙利亚的边境上旅行过的人亲眼看到，那里有大量的土耳其步兵和装甲部队正在挖掘战壕。这些土耳其的军队都装备着美式武器，其中有火箭炮和无后座力炮。就在这个地区，旅行者看到了三十个“穿着野战服装的美国军官和军士”。
    事情非常清楚，美国军官在土叙边境的“正常活动”，原来就是直接指挥和协助土耳其部队进行侵略叙利亚的战斗准备！
