Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a report meeting today to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, delivered a report to more than 3,500 propaganda cadres in Beijing at the meeting.

In his report, Qian Junrui elaborated in detail on the great historical significance of the October Revolution, the great achievements of the Soviet Union in socialist construction, and its great contributions to defending world peace and promoting the cause of human progress.

When talking about the important significance of continuing to consolidate and develop the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, Qian Junrui said that the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union not only fully conforms to the fundamental interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also to the fundamental interests of the people of the world. The friendly and cooperative relations between China and the Soviet Union are based on complete equality and mutual assistance. The Soviet Union has given selfless assistance to our country from the Great Revolution of 1927 to the War of Resistance Against Japan, as well as to our country's socialist construction. Therefore, further strengthening Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation and consolidating and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is our lofty responsibility. When talking about learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience, Qian Junrui said that Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us to learn from the Soviet Union, and only by earnestly learning from the Soviet Union can we reduce the difficulties in our socialist construction.

Qian Junrui finally said that the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution is approaching, and we must vigorously publicize the path of the October Revolution, oppose revisionism, and refute the slanderous remarks of imperialism and bourgeois rightists against the Soviet Union, communism, socialism, and Marxism-Leninism. We warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution and want to show that the Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people and march towards the road of communism in unity.

    钱俊瑞向北京市三千多宣传干部作报告
    据新华社26日讯　北京市中苏友好协会为庆祝十月革命四十周年，在今天举行报告会。中苏友好协会总会秘书长钱俊瑞在会上向北京市三千五百多名宣传干部作了报告。
   钱俊瑞在报告中详细地阐明了十月革命的伟大历史意义，苏联在社会主义建设方面的伟大成就，对于保卫世界和平和促进人类进步事业的伟大贡献。
    在讲到继续巩固和发展中苏两国人民的友谊的重要意义时，钱俊瑞说，中苏两国友好合作，不仅完全符合中苏两国人民的根本利益，也符合全世界人民的根本利益。中苏两国的友好合作关系是建立在完全平等、相互帮助的基础上的。苏联对我国从1927年大革命到抗日战争，以及我国的社会主义建设，都给予了无私的援助。因此，进一步加强中苏友好合作，巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，这是我们崇高的责任。钱俊瑞在谈到学习苏联的先进经验时说，毛主席一再教导我们学习苏联，只有认真地学习苏联，才能减少我们建设社会主义的困难。
    钱俊瑞最后说，十月革命四十周年快到了，我们要大力宣传十月革命的道路，反对修正主义，驳斥帝国主义和资产阶级右派分子反苏、反共、反社会主义和反马克思列宁主义的谰言。我们热烈地庆祝十月革命四十周年，要表示中国人民永远和苏联人民站在一起，团结一致地向共产主义道路迈进。
