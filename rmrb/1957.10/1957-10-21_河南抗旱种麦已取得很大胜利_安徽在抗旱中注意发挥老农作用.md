Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th -- Henan Province's drought resistance wheat planting has achieved a great victory. By October 18, the province had sown 61.55 million mu of winter wheat, completing 72% of the 85 million mu wheat planting plan.

However, the current drought resistance wheat planting movement in Henan Province has entered the most tense and arduous stage. More than 23 million mu of wheat planting tasks need to be carried out under more arid and water-scarce conditions; about 20% of the wheat that has already been planted is missing seedlings and broken ridges, requiring timely inspection and replanting. Moreover, the drought continues, and we must immediately carry out a more arduous struggle to resist drought and protect seedlings.

Therefore, at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held from October 15 to 19, the "Resolution on Resolutely Completing the Drought Resistance Wheat Planting Plan" was adopted. The resolution emphasized: the whole Party must be further mobilized, continue to lead the people of the province, make persistent efforts, mobilize all forces, find all possible ways, overcome all difficulties, ensure the completion of the 85 million mu planting plan, and ensure the quality of planting.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th -- Funan, Guoyang and other counties in Anhui Province have paid attention to the role of elderly farmers in drought resistance wheat planting, with good results. On October 9, Gengji Township in Funan County held 36 forums for old farmers. The old farmers introduced a total of 527 spring sources. After excavation, they generally had water sources. Three spring sources introduced by an 84-year-old farmer from Li Dazhuang team of Jiankang Agricultural Cooperative were as big as a basin mouth and could irrigate 50 mu of land. In the Third Reform Third Agricultural Cooperative of Guoyang County, many members lost confidence in drought resistance wheat planting. The cooperative invited Jiang Qingya, an old farmer of 92 years old in this village, to introduce the situation of severe drought sixty years ago. The old man said that there was no rain for nine months that year, and only Jiang Qingyun's family in Jiangguang Village planted four mu of wheat by resisting drought, and each mu harvested 130 jin, and their lives were very good. The remaining eight households fled the famine, and one family of four starved to death in the village. These facts have deeply educated the members. The number of people resisting drought in this village increased from 18 to 70 the next day.

    河南抗旱种麦已取得很大胜利
    安徽在抗旱中注意发挥老农作用
    本报郑州20日电  目前，河南省抗旱种麦已经取得很大胜利，到10月18日，全省已播种冬小麦六千一百五十五万亩，完成种麦八千五百万亩计划的72％。
    但是，河南省当前抗旱种麦运动，已经进入最紧张、最艰苦的阶段。有二千三百余万亩的种麦任务，需要在更加干旱和水源困难的条件下进行；已经种上的小麦，有20％左右缺苗断垅，需要及时查苗补种，而且干旱延续，必须紧接着进行更加艰巨的抗旱保苗斗争。
    因此，在中共河南省委员会10月15日至19日举行的第六次全体会议上，通过了“关于坚决完成抗旱种麦计划的决议”。决议中强调指出：全党必须进一步动员起来，继续领导全省人民，再接再厉，动员一切力量，想尽一切办法，克服一切困难，保证完成八千五百万亩的播种计划，并且要保证播种质量。
    新华社合肥20日电  安徽省阜南、涡阳等县在抗旱种麦中注意发挥老年农民的作用，效果很好。阜南县耿集乡在10月9日召开了三十六处老农座谈会，老农共介绍了五百二十七个泉眼，经过挖掘，一般都有水源。健康农业社李大庄队一个八十四岁的老农介绍的三个泉眼都有盆口大，共可浇地五十亩。涡阳县三改第三农业社不少社员对抗旱种麦失去信心。社里请这庄上的九十二岁老农江卿雅介绍了六十年前遭受大旱的情况。老人说，那年九个月不雨，江光庄上的十户人家只有江卿云一家抗旱种麦四亩，每亩收了一百三十斤，生活过得很好，其余八户出外逃荒，一户全家四口在庄上都饿死了。这些事实使社员受到了深刻的教育。这个庄第二天抗旱人数即由十八人增加到七十人。
