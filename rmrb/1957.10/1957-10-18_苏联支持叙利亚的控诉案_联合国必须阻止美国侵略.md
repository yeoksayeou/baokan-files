Xinhua News Agency, October 17th, TASS New York: The head of the Soviet delegation to the 12th UN General Assembly, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, sent a letter to the President of the UN General Assembly, Munro, on the 16th. The full text is as follows: Mr. President:

　　The situation surrounding Syria is very tense and contains the possibility of armed conflict breaking out at any time.

　　The continuous military preparations by Turkey on the border adjacent to Syria illustrate this point; large numbers of Turkish troops, under the name of the Turkish Hatay Mobile Force, have been concentrated there. This force includes two infantry divisions (one of which is a gendarmerie division), four independent infantry regiments, three armored brigades, nearly five hundred tanks, self-propelled guns, aircraft, and various artillery pieces. Turkish troops are now continuing to gather on the Turkish-Syrian border, and have reached 50,000 men so far. There is solid evidence that the Turkish General Staff, together with U.S. military staff, has jointly developed a detailed plan for a Turkish offensive against Syria, ready to be implemented immediately after the Turkish elections on October 27th, and now they are trying to make it appear as if the tension surrounding Syria has eased, but this is just a disguise, an attempt to deceive the public in Turkey and other countries, to ensure a surprise attack on the peace-loving Syrian nation.

　　The purpose of armed intervention in the internal affairs of a UN member state—Syria—is to strangle the independent Syrian nation, which, with the support of parliament and the people, has consistently pursued a policy of defending national independence and not participating in aggressive blocs.

　　It cannot be ignored that an armed attack on Syria by Turkey, as a participant in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, cannot but lead to the expansion of the conflict to other countries. The United States, a major member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is 9,000 kilometers away from Syria and lives on another continent, is now openly claiming that they are prepared to send their armed forces to stand on Turkey's side and directly participate in military operations against Syria, and is instigating Turkey to launch an aggression against Syria. This statement, which completely violates the purposes and principles of the United Nations, proves that the United States intends to drag other countries of the North Atlantic bloc into armed conflict.

　　Only someone who has lost touch with reality would not consider that Syria is not isolated in its war against aggression. Everyone knows that the Egyptian government has stated that if Syria is attacked, the Egyptian government will support it without limit.

　　Everyone also knows that many other Arab countries support independent Syria and advocate that if Syria is attacked, it must be given assistance. Standing on the side of the Syrian people are the peace-loving people of other countries, including the Soviet people, who cannot remain indifferent to military provocations being planned close to the southern borders of the Soviet Union.

　　The Soviet government has authorized me to state that the Soviet government is very concerned about the disturbing situation in the Middle East caused by the events surrounding Syria. The Soviet government believes that the armed conflict created by the Turkish and American ruling circles in this region poses a serious danger to the cause of world peace. The United Nations cannot ignore such events and cannot remain passive.

　　It must be considered here that the United States is not only instigating Turkey to invade Syria, but also advocating that it be done in a blitzkrieg manner, so that the United Nations is faced with a fait accompli and has no time to take measures to prevent the aggression. Obviously, here the United States is attempting to use the same means it used to suppress the independence movement in Guatemala in Syria.

　　In this situation, the responsibility of UN member states directly under the UN Charter is to immediately intervene to prevent the occurrence and expansion of war.

　　The Soviet government supports Syria's proposal: the General Assembly should immediately study the threat of military attack facing Syria and the danger to universal peace as a result. The Soviet government also supports the suggestion to immediately establish a special UN committee to carefully investigate the situation on the Syrian-Turkish border. This committee should submit its conclusions and judgments to the Security Council and the UN General Assembly within two weeks.

　　At the same time, in view of the growing danger of war in the Middle East and the need to take effective measures to prevent possible aggression, the Soviet government suggests that if Turkey violates the peace on the Syrian border and attacks Syria, UN member states should immediately provide Syria with the necessary armed assistance to stop the aggression. The Soviet government declares that the Soviet Union is ready to send its armed forces to participate in suppressing aggression and punishing those who disrupt peace.

　　The Soviet government believes that in this regard it must be emphasized that the interests of maintaining peace and the security interests of countries near this region require all countries to act immediately when the Syrian border is violated and Turkish troops invade Syria.

　　The Soviet government believes that the UN General Assembly will study this most serious issue involving the interests of peace and the security of all peoples with due attention.

### 苏联支持叙利亚的控诉案  联合国必须阻止美国侵略

　　苏联支持叙利亚的控诉案
    联合国必须阻止美国侵略
    新华社17日讯　塔斯社纽约讯：苏联出席第十二届联大的代表团团长、苏联外交部长葛罗米柯16日给联合国大会主席孟罗一封信。全文如下：主席先生：
    围绕着叙利亚形成的局势非常紧张、蕴藏着随时爆发武装冲突的可能性。
    在与叙利亚接壤的边境上土耳其不断进行军事准备，就说明了这一点；在那里，到目前为止，集中了以土耳其哈塔伊机动部队为名的大批土耳其军队。这个部队包括二个步兵师（其中有一个宪兵师），四个独立步兵团，三个装甲旅，将近五百辆坦克、自动炮，飞机和各种炮。土耳其军队现在继续在土叙边境上集结，到目前为止已达五万人。有确实的材料可证明：土耳其总司令部同美国军事参谋人员共同制定了土耳其进攻叙利亚的详细计划，准备在10月27日土耳其进行选举以后立即执行，而现在，他们企图把事情说成是似乎围绕叙利亚的紧张局势已经缓和，其实这只是一种伪装，想以此来迷惑土耳其本国以及其他国家的公众，以保证它对爱好和平的叙利亚国家实行突然进攻。
    武装干涉联合国会员国——叙利亚内政的目的，是扼杀在议会和人民的支持下始终不渝地奉行捍卫民族独立和不参加侵略集团的政策的、独立的叙利亚国家。
    不能不看到，作为北大西洋集团参加者的土耳其对叙利亚的武装攻击，不能不引起把冲突扩大到其他国家。距离叙利亚有九千公里远的、住在另一个大陆上的、北大西洋公约的组织的主要成员国——美国现在就已经公开地声称，他们准备派自己的武装部队站在土耳其方面直接参加对叙利亚的军事行动，并且正在唆使土耳其对叙利亚进行侵略。这种完全违背联合国的宗旨和原则的言论证明，美国打算把北大西洋集团的其他国家拖入武装冲突。
    只有失去现实感的人才会不考虑到，叙利亚在自己的反侵略战争中不是孤立无援的。大家都知道，埃及政府已经声明：一旦叙利亚遭到侵略，埃及政府将无限地支持它。
    大家还知道，许多其他阿拉伯国家都支持独立的叙利亚并且主张如果叙利亚遭到侵略，就必须给它援助。站在叙利亚人民这方面的还有其他国家爱好和平的人民，其中包括苏联人民，苏联人民不能对别人在紧靠苏联南部国界的地方策划军事挑衅漠不关心。
    苏联政府授权给我声明，苏联政府非常关怀由于叙利亚周围的事件在中近东地区所造成的令人不安的局势。苏联政府认为，土耳其和美国的统治集团在这个地区所制造的武装冲突，对维护世界和平的事业蕴藏着严重的危险。联合国不能忽视这种事件，不能表示消极。
    这里不能不考虑到，美国不但唆使土耳其去侵略叙利亚，并且主张闪电式地干完这件事，使联合国面临既成事实，来不及采取措施防止侵略。显然，这里美国企图把它在镇压危地马拉独立运动时所用过的手段拿来在叙利亚使用。
    在这种情况下，联合国会员国直接根据联合国宪章应有的责任，就是要立刻出面干预，以便防止发生和扩大战争。
    苏联政府支持叙利亚的建议：大会应立刻研究叙利亚面临军事进攻的威胁以及普遍和平因而蒙受危险的问题。苏联政府也支持关于立刻成立联合国专门委员会来仔细调查叙土边境局势这一建议。这个委员会应该在两个星期内把自己的结论和判断交给安全理事会和联合国大会。
    同时，鉴于中近东地区战争危险日益增涨，以及必须采取有效措施来阻止可能的侵略，苏联政府建议，如果土耳其破坏叙利亚边境的和平，并且进攻叙利亚，联合国会员国应立刻给叙利亚必要的武装援助以制止侵略。苏联政府声明，苏联准备派自己的武装部队参加镇压侵略和惩罚和平破坏者。
    苏联政府认为在这方面必须强调指出，维护和平的利益以及这一地区附近国家的安全利益，要求各国在叙利亚边境受到破坏以及土耳其军队侵入叙利亚时立刻行动起来。
    苏联政府相信联合国大会一定会以应有的注意来研究这个最严重地涉及和平和各国人民安全利益的问题。
