　　(Reported by this newspaper) Following the spirit of "rectifying while rectifying," the provincial, prefectural, and county-level organizations of Zhejiang Province have transferred a large number of cadres to work in lower-level and grassroots units such as rural areas, factories, culture, education, and health. As of the end of August, the province had sent down a total of 29,909 cadres, including 328 department-level cadres from provincial-level organizations and department-level cadres or higher from prefectural and municipal party committees, and 2,353 section-level cadres from provincial and prefectural-level organizations and department-level cadres from county party committees. Most of these cadres who were sent down had long been engaged in grassroots work and had certain work experience. Therefore, some of them assumed leadership positions in lower-level or grassroots units, while the vast majority participated in specific grassroots work.

　　After the cadres in Zhejiang Province were sent down, they strengthened the leadership core of grassroots organizations, enabling the work to be carried out rapidly. For example, the 72 districts and 767 townships in the Wenzhou Prefecture were all equipped with county-level and district-level cadres to serve as district party secretaries and township general branch secretaries. Because they lived among the masses, problems in their work were solved in a timely manner. Some problems in the Ningyi Township cooperatives in Ruian County had not been solved for a long time. After Lin Rongfa, a cadre sent down by the county party committee, came to the township as the general branch secretary, he and the original cadres conducted in-depth investigations and research, solving the problems while carrying out socialist propaganda and education among the masses. At the same time, he set an example by leading cadres and the masses to participate in labor production. In this way, after more than a month, the backwardness of the township was changed. Not only did the members not make trouble over the grain issue, but they also sold 6,000 catties of surplus grain to the state; the members who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperative not only did not withdraw, but also requested that the elementary cooperative be transformed into an advanced cooperative; and the labor attendance rate of the members also increased to more than 90%.

　　The cadres sent down throughout the province have also been trained in practical work. Many cadres, after going down to the grassroots level, learned the working methods of the mass line, leading the masses to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, so that the cooperatives were consolidated. They reflected: After being put into the fiery production struggle, especially after this socialist education movement, their political and ideological understanding has been greatly improved, and they have also gained a lot of practical work experience, which is even better than going to school once!

### 既充实了基层  又锻炼了自己  浙江近三万名下放干部大有收获

    既充实了基层  又锻炼了自己
    浙江近三万名下放干部大有收获
    本报讯  浙江省的省、专区和县三级机关，在整风中贯彻“边整边改”的精神，抽调大批干部到农村、工厂、文教卫生等下层和基层单位工作。截至8月底止，全省已下放干部二万九千九百零九名，其中有省级机关处长和地委、市委机关部长以上干部三百二十八名，省、专区级机关科长、县委部长级干部二千三百五十三名。这些下放的干部，大都是长期从事过基层工作，有一定工作经验。因此，他们之中有一部分人担任了下层或基层领导工作，绝大部分人参加基层具体工作。
    浙江省干部下放后，加强了基层组织的领导核心，使工作得到迅速开展。如温州专区的七十二个区和七百六十七个乡，都配备了县级和区级干部担任区委书记和乡总支书记，由于他们生活在群众中，工作中的问题便及时获得解决。瑞安县宁益乡有些合作社过去存在的问题，长期得不到解决。县委下放干部林荣发到该乡任总支书记后，便和原来的干部一起深入调查研究，一面进行解决，一面向群众进行社会主义宣传教育。同时，他还以身作则带动干部、群众参加劳动生产。这样，一个多月后，该乡的落后面貌即有了改变。社员不但不闹粮食问题，而且还把六千斤余粮卖给国家；原来要求退社的社员不但不退社了，而且还要求将初级社转为高级社；社员的劳动出勤率也提高到90％以上。
    全省下放的干部，在实际工作中也得到了锻炼。许多干部下到基层后，学会了群众路线的工作方法，领导群众开展增产节约运动，使合作社得到巩固。他们反映：投入了火热的生产斗争以后，特别是经过这次社会主义教育运动，使自己在政治上、思想上得到很大提高，同时也增长了许多实际工作经验，这比进一次学校还要强！
