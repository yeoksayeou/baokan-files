　　An Exhibition Hall Accusing Colonialist Crimes
　　Cheng Liangping
    In the Damascus International Fair Center, a very noticeable exhibition hall has appeared this year. Its area is only 200 square meters, and the exhibits are not numerous, but it always attracts thousands of visitors every day. This hall is the Algerian Exhibition Hall—an exhibition hall accusing French colonialism of its crimes in Algeria to the whole world.
    As soon as I entered this exhibition hall, I saw a huge photograph. In this photo, a group of women is leading a group of pitiful children, and behind them is a barren land. I couldn't understand the Arabic caption of this photo and was about to ask someone next to me. At this time, a middle-aged man took the initiative to explain to me: "This photo is one of the sketches of the current life of Algerian women and children. It shows that Algeria is currently in a severe war environment, and almost all the men have gone to the mountains to fight the French army."
    I thanked the enthusiastic middle-aged man with gratitude. He warmly asked if I was from Beijing and handed me a business card. At this time, I learned that he was the curator of the Algerian Exhibition Hall, Mr. Tourgana Larbi. After a short conversation, he accompanied me to visit the entire exhibition hall.
    The first part of the exhibition hall records the bloody acts of French colonialists in Algeria. On August 20, 1955, a small city called Philippeville in northern Algeria was bombed by the French army, resulting in the death of 2,000 people. A photo recorded the scene after the city was bombed, which was appalling. In another photo, there is a corpse of an Algerian who was killed by the French colonial army. This innocent victim was shot with fifty-one bullet holes, and his neck was cut after his death. A Syrian pointed to this photo and said to me: "This is 'Western civilization'!" The curator told me: "Due to our war environment and various technical limitations, what you see here is only a very small part of the atrocities committed by the French army in Algeria." It is estimated that since the Algerian armed uprising began in late 1954, more than 200,000 Algerian civilians have been killed by the French army.
    The second part of the exhibition hall records the life and battle of the Algerian National Liberation Army. In this part of the photos, "Soldiers and Orphans" is the first one. After seeing this photo, I immediately thought of the scene of the Chinese People's Liberation Army living together with the people in the arduous combat environment and sharing weal and woe. Then, in many photos, I saw the combat life, military training, and equipment of the Algerian National Liberation Army. The revolutionary optimism of the Algerian National Liberation Army, the confidence in victory, and the growth and strengthening in the process of struggle made me deeply feel that this armed force is invincible. The curator told me that when the Algerian National Liberation Army first started armed struggle, it only had a few old rifles and other short weapons. Then, he pointed to the heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, and anti-tank guns in the photos and proudly and humorously told me: "Friends, these weapons of ours were given to us by the French army for free. We have almost all the weapons that the French army has now. Moreover, we now also have weapons from Western countries such as the United States and Britain. These British and American weapons are all obtained from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization through the French army."
    Indeed, French colonialists are frantically carrying out military suppression in Algeria with the support of international colonialist forces. However, the struggle of the Algerian National Liberation Army is just. They have not only received the support of the vast Algerian people, but also the support of anti-colonialist forces around the world. Therefore, facing the French colonial army, which has modern weapons and is twenty times larger in number, they have not been defeated, but have continued to send news of victories to the world. The photos in the pavilion show that in more than two years, they have liberated nearly two-thirds of the country's land.
    Speaking of the Algerian National Liberation Army, I have to mention the role of Algerian women in the army as shown in the photos. Algerian women are currently not only participating in logistics, medical care, and other work, but also directly participating in combat. In the battle, many heroines have emerged. The curator said to me: "According to Algeria's past traditions, women are not allowed to have contact with men. But today, under the slogan of 'Everything for the Revolution,' the Algerian people are united as closely as a family. Men and women, strangers and acquaintances, are all living and fighting for a common goal."
    After visiting the exhibition hall, I talked with the curator about the future of Algeria. He said with confidence: "The Algerian people's revolution cannot be suppressed. We advocate a peaceful solution to the Algerian issue and demand that France respect our sovereignty and independence. However, we will never give up armed struggle until this goal is achieved. The French colonialists' stubborn attitude and various deceptive tactics in resolving the Algerian issue can only arouse greater anger among the people, thereby accelerating the victory of the people's revolution."

### 一个控诉殖民主义罪行的展览馆

　　一个控诉殖民主义罪行的展览馆
　　程良平
    在大马士革国际博览会中心，今年出现了一个非常受人注意的展览馆。它的面积只有二百平方公尺，展品也不多，可是每天总是吸引着成千上万的参观者。这个馆就是阿尔及利亚展览馆——一个向全世界控诉法国殖民主义在阿尔及利亚罪行的展览馆。
    我一走进这个展览馆，迎面就看见一张巨幅照片。在这张照片里，有一群妇女领着一群可怜的孩子，在他们后面是一片荒芜的土地。我看不懂这张照片的阿拉伯文解说词，正想向身旁的人询问。这时，一位中年人主动地为我解释说：“这张照片就是目前阿尔及利亚妇女和孩子们的生活素描之一。它说明了我们阿尔及利亚目前正处在严酷的战争环境里，男人们差不多都到山区同法国军队作战去了。”
    我怀着感激的心情向这位热情的中年人道谢。他热情地问我是不是从北京来的，并且递给我一张名片。这时，我才知道他就是阿尔及利亚展览馆馆长土尔加纳·拉尔比先生。稍事交谈后，他就陪着我参观了整个展览馆。
    展览馆的第一部分记录了法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚的血腥行为。1955年8月20日，阿尔及利亚北部一个名叫菲利普维勒的小城市曾经遭到法军的滥炸，结果炸死了两千人。有一张照片记下了这个城市被炸后的情景，令人惨不忍睹。在另外一张照片上，有一个被法国殖民军队残杀的阿尔及利亚人的尸体。这个无辜的受害者身上被打了五十一个枪眼，死后脖子上还被砍了一刀。一位叙利亚人指着这张照片对我说：“这就是‘西方文明’！”馆长告诉我：“由于我们处于战争环境和其他种种技术条件的限制，你们在这里看到的只是法国军队在阿尔及利亚的暴行的很小一部分。”据估计，自从1954年末阿尔及利亚武装起义开始以来，被法国军队残杀的阿尔及利亚平民就有二十万以上。
    展览馆的第二部分照片，记录了阿尔及利亚民族解放军的生活和战斗。在这部分照片里，“战士们和孤儿”是第一张。看了这张照片，我立即联想起中国人民解放军在艰苦的战斗环境里和人民同甘共苦地生活在一起的情景。接着，又在很多照片上，我看到了阿尔及利亚民族解放军的战斗生活、军事训练和装备情况。阿尔及利亚民族解放军的革命乐观情绪，对胜利的信心，和在斗争过程中的成长和壮大，使我深深感到这支武装力量是不可战胜的。馆长告诉我，当阿尔及利亚民族解放军刚刚开始武装斗争的时候，只有很少一些破旧的步枪和其他短武器。接着，他指着照片里的重机枪、溜弹炮和反坦克炮等武器，骄傲而幽默地告诉我说：“朋友，我们这些武器是法国军队免费赠送给我们的。法国军队现在有的武器，我们差不多都有。而且，我们现在也有美国和英国等西方国家的武器。这些英美武器都是通过法国军队从北大西洋公约组织那里得到的。”
    的确，法国殖民主义者是在国际殖民主义势力支持下疯狂地在阿尔及利亚进行军事镇压的。但是，阿尔及利亚民族解放军的斗争是正义的，他们不但得到了阿尔及利亚广大人民的支持，而且得到了全世界反殖民主义力量的支持。因此，他们面对着拥有现代化武器、人数占二十倍优势的法国殖民军队，不但没有被打垮，而且向全世界不断传出战斗的捷报。馆内的照片显示，在两年多的时间内，他们已经解放了全国将近三分之二的土地。
    谈到阿尔及利亚民族解放军，我不得不提一下照片中显示的阿尔及利亚妇女目前在军队中的作用。阿尔及利亚妇女目前不仅参加了后勤、医务等工作，而且也直接参加了战斗。在战斗中，已经涌现了不少女英雄。馆长对我说：“根据尔阿及利亚过去的传统，妇女是不准同男人接触的。但是在今天，阿尔及利亚人民在‘一切为了革命。’的口号下紧紧地团结得像一个家庭一样。男人和女人，生人和熟人，都在为了一个共同的目标而生活和战斗。”
    参观展览馆后，我和馆长谈到了阿尔及利亚的前途。他满怀信心地说：“阿尔及利亚人民革命是镇压不了的。我们主张和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，要求法国尊重我们主权和独立。但是，在没有达到这个目的以前，我们决不会放弃武装斗争。法国殖民主义在解决阿尔及利亚问题上的死硬态度和各种欺骗手段，只能激起人民更大的愤怒，从而加速人民革命的胜利。”（附图片）
