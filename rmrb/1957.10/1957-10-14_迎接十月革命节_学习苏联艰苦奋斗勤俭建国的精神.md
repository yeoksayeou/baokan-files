　　Welcoming the October Revolution Day
    Learning from the Spirit of Hard Struggle and Thrifty Nation-Building of the Soviet Union
　　Xu Guangping
    From 1949 to 1955, I visited or passed through Moscow, the great fortress of human liberation, five times, and each time it gave me strength and encouragement. There, I spent the world's working people's own festival - "May Day," and also the world's revolutionary people's own festival - November 7th. Since then, the soul-stirring songs of assembled ranks have, on every festival, evoked in me a sense of reminiscence and longing as if I were there!

    The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. Since 1949, we too have had our own festivals on "May Day" and in October. We rejoice and celebrate victory in the same way, and in the same way we examine our achievements and look forward to the future of socialist construction. The feeling of missing and longing for the distant places is even stronger, and the belief in striving for a common goal is even more resolute!

    On the occasion of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the great October Revolution, which founded the first socialist country in human history, I would like to put forward the spirit of hard struggle and thrifty nation-building of the Soviet people as an example for us to learn from.

    Comrades who have been to the Soviet Union all know that the world-class Moscow subway station was built with high art and science. But even during the arduous Patriotic War, new subway stations were constantly being built, such as the station with the statue of Tanya standing tall, and the station with heroic statues from the Patriotic War inlaid on all four walls. They deeply demonstrate the Soviet people's heroic spirit and communist spirit in defending their motherland, completely defeating the fascist bandits, and ending the great struggle of World War II.

    I have been to the heroic city of Leningrad twice, which was besieged by the enemy for nine hundred days. At that time, the people of this heroic city found Lake Ladoga and connected it with other republics as a lifeline to overcome difficulties, so that the cruiser "Aurora" could be kept safe and sound, and the Winter Palace, which had experienced revolution, and the memorial room where Lenin had guided work, also appeared as usual with its indestructible heroic posture.

    Have not Kiev and Minsk, which were once occupied by Hitler's bandits, become more beautiful cities? Are not the parks, which are more lush, prosperous, majestic and novel, displaying the heroic spirit of the people of the Soviet Union's various republics even more than before the war? "The enemy can destroy it, we can rebuild it," this is the result of the Soviet people's hard struggle. This achievement is the amazing accomplishment they have achieved through their great voluntary labor, with every one of their people, including young men and women, working together with their spare strength to restore cities and build villages. Thus, a solid foundation was laid for the victory of socialism.

    "Peaceful construction" and "peaceful competition" are no longer empty slogans in the Soviet Union, but practical action programs. They say, "Every bit of work we do is a bit more effort for peace. We will never allow war to break out again, we want everyone in the world to no longer suffer from the ravages of war." This is exactly the case. Is it not the Soviet Union that first turned iron-clad, mythical miracles into commonplace occurrences on the world stage? The Soviet artificial earth satellite, which shook the world and frightened the American imperialists, flies around the earth at its accurate time every day, sending signals to the earth, and the possibility of mankind breaking through the earth's gravity has already begun to appear. The success of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the application of jet airliners, and the application of atomic energy power stations are all examples of the great achievements in high science and technology. How did they come about? Lenin told us at the Third All-Russian Soviet Congress that this is because

  "All technical miracles and cultural achievements have become the property of the whole people, and from now on, human wisdom and genius will never again become instruments of oppression and exploitation." Therefore, miracles are not miracles, myths become stories, and new achievements come in an endless stream.

    After celebrating the harvest, it would be wrong to obliterate the hard struggle and neglect the stage of building the country with diligence and thrift.

    Who is it that has successfully implemented the Sixth Five-Year Plan? Who is it that has leapt from a backward country to become the strongest country in Europe in just forty years? Who is it that has made the degree of industrial mechanization and automation one of the highest in the world? Who is it that has the most combine harvesters and new industrial equipment, the longest power transmission lines, the highest degree of mechanization in the coal mining industry, and the largest scale of hydropower station construction projects, making it the largest country in the world? Who is it that has made labor productivity grow at an average annual rate exceeding any capitalist country? Who is it that possesses the largest and most mechanized agriculture in the world, making the total wheat production exceed that of the United States and Canada, ranking first in the world; making the unit area yield and quality of cotton rank first in the world; making the important economic crop - sugar beet - long rank first in the world; making the potato planting area and production rank first in the world; and making many important agricultural products leap to the first place in the world? Who is it that has more engineers in all walks of life than the United States, making the training of science and technology specialists exceed any capitalist country; making the development of cultural and artistic undertakings win the admiration of people all over the world; making the latest achievements in science and technology, such as the utilization of atomic energy, be at the forefront of any country in the world and contribute to the cause of human peace? Who is it that has improved the health of the people, with a mortality rate lower than that of other countries in the world, and an average life expectancy twice as long as before the revolution, in forty years? Who is it that has made the phenomenon of unemployment disappear forever across the country, making the unity of the people of all nationalities in the country as solid as a rock and becoming a strong fortress of the peace and democracy camp? All of this, apart from the glorious light of the October Revolution, the hard struggle of the Soviet people, the strong leadership of the Communist Party, and the incomparable superiority of the socialist system, who else can find other reasons?

    Now the labor enthusiasm of the Soviet people is unprecedentedly high. The labor insurance regulations cannot limit the countless thousands of working people who have reached retirement age and are enthusiastic about socialist construction, forgetting themselves and unremittingly contributing to the cause of socialism towards communism. The powerful and heroic words encourage every Soviet person - our example - who repeatedly say: "Every bit of work that everyone does is a bit more effort for peace." For the sake of peace, for the cause of communism, for the sake of the glorious cause of human liberation. When Marxism-Leninism is in the hands of the working people, it will become an incomparably powerful and invincible force.

    The Soviet people are all for socialism and for communism. They themselves never know what is worth considering about putting on airs. People who have traveled on international trains will see that our respected Soviet experts buy food themselves when the train stops at the station; comrades who have been to factories and construction sites will see that Soviet experts personally roll up their sleeves, covered in oil stains, and work with the workers; people who have visited large Soviet printing factories will see that they give the latest machines to brotherly countries while keeping the old ones for themselves. Perhaps some people will point out that the exterior of a certain house in Moscow is already very old, or that some of their exhibition halls and showrooms are using old buildings, but those smug gentlemen intentionally "forget" or ignorantly disregard the many great achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology - the many world-first achievements - but secretly close their eyes, deceive themselves and whisper in their ears: "The Soviet Union is very bad, the Soviet Union is very unsuccessful." Does this mosquito sound want to become thunder?! However, thunder is definitely not a mosquito! It is now creating earth satellites, writing a new page in human history. Celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, we also sincerely celebrate the increasingly brilliant display of the labor achievements of the leader of the socialist camp - the great achievements of the Soviet Union!

　　迎接十月革命节
    学习苏联艰苦奋斗勤俭建国的精神
　　许广平
    从1949—1955年为止，我曾五次参观或经过莫斯科这人类解放事业的伟大堡垒，每一次都给予我以振奋鼓舞的力量。在那里，我度过世界劳动人民自己的节日——“五一”，也度过世界革命人民自己的节日——十一月七日。从此，震撼心灵的集合队伍的歌声，每逢节日就如同身历其境引起我的怀念和向往之情！
    十月革命一声炮响，给我们带来了马克思列宁主义。从1949年以后，“五一”、十月，我们也各有自己的节日了。我们一样的欢欣鼓舞，一样的庆祝胜利，一样的为社会主义建设事业检验成果、展望将来。怀念、向往远方之情更加坚强，为共同目标而奋斗的信念更加坚决！
    值此庆祝伟大的创立人类历史上第一个社会主义国家的十月革命四十周年的时日里，我愿提出苏联人民艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的精神，作为我们学习的榜样。
    到过苏联的同志都知道：世界第一流的莫斯科地下电车站，是以高度艺术、科学建成的。但就在艰苦的卫国战争中，还不断建成新的电车站，如以丹娘雕刻像的屹立站和四壁以卫国战争中的英雄雕像镶嵌在内的车站等，都深刻显示了苏联人民在捍卫祖国、彻底击溃法西斯强盗、结束第二次世界大战的伟大斗争中所表现的英勇气概和共产主义精神。
    我曾两次到过英雄的城市列宁格勒，那里被敌人包围过九百天。当时，这个英雄城市的人民找出拉托喀湖与其他共和国通连作为生活道路以突破困难，使“阿芙乐尔”军舰却能保守得安全无恙，使饱经革命的冬宫和列宁指导过工作的纪念室也以它的坚强无比的雄姿照常出现。
    曾经被希特勒匪徒侵占过的基辅、明斯克不又成为更美丽的城市了吗？更加茂密繁盛，雄壮而又新奇的公园，不是较战前还更显示出苏联各加盟共和国人民的豪迈气概吗？“敌能复之，我能复之”，这是苏联人民从艰苦奋斗中得来的成果。这个成果，是他们每一个人民连青年男女在一起用自己的业余力量，在恢复城市、建设乡村的时候用伟大的义务劳动所获致的惊人成就。因而为社会主义的胜利奠定了坚实的基础。
    “和平建设”“和平竞赛”，这在苏联已经不是空洞的口号，而是实际的行动纲领。他们说：“我们每个人多做一分工作就是为和平多尽一分力量。我们再不允许战争爆发，我们要世界上所有的人都不要再受战争的摧残”。事实正是这样。铁一般的把神话似的奇迹变成常例般的出现于世界舞台上的科学创举，难道不是苏联首先做到的吗？震撼世界、吓得美帝国主义惊慌失措的苏联人造地球卫星，每天以它的准确的时间绕地球飞行，向地球发射讯号，将使人类冲破地心吸力而存在的可能已见端倪，洲际弹道火箭的成功，喷气式客机的运用，和原子能发电站的运用等高度的科学技术上的伟大成就，是怎样得来的呢？列宁在第三次全俄苏维埃代表大会上告诉我们，这是因为
  “一切技术奇迹和文化成果都变成全民的财产，从现在起，人类的智慧和天才永远不再会成为压迫的手段和剥削的手段了”。因而奇迹不奇，神话成话，新的成就，源源而来。
    在庆祝丰收之后，如果抹煞了艰苦奋斗，忽略了勤俭建国的阶段是不应该的。
    是谁顺利执行到第六个五年计划的呢？是谁在短短的四十年间从落后国家跃居欧洲第一强国呢？是谁使工业的机械化和自动化的程度在世界上是占头等的呢？是谁使联合机和工业新装备最多，输电线最长，煤矿工业机械化程度最高，水电站建设工程规模最大，是世界上最大的国家呢？是谁使劳动生产率每年平均增长速度超过任何资本主义国家的呢？是谁拥有世界上规模最大、机械化最高的农业，使小麦总产量超过美国和加拿大，占世界第一；使棉花的单位面积产量和质量居世界第一；使重要的经济作物——甜菜早就占世界第一；使马铃薯播种面积和生产量占世界第一；又使许多重要农产品跃居世界第一的呢？是谁使各行各业的工程师超过美国，使科技专门人才的培养超过任何资本主义国家；使文化艺术事业的发展博得全世界人民的敬慕；使科学技术上的最新成就如原子能的利用走在世界任何国家的最前面并为人类和平事业贡献了力量的呢？是谁使人民健康增强，死亡率低于世界各国，平均寿命比革命前、四十年间延长一倍的呢？是谁使全国人民的失业现象永远绝迹，使国内各民族人民坚如磐石的团结在一起并成为和平民主阵营的坚强堡垒的呢？所有这一切一切，除了十月革命的光辉照耀，除了苏联人民的艰苦奋斗，除了共产党的坚强领导和社会主义制度的无比优越而外，谁还能找到其他原因呢？
    现在苏联人民的劳动热情空前高涨。劳动保险条例不能限制成千上万不可胜数的热诚于社会主义建设的已达退休期限的劳动人民忘我地为社会主义走向共产主义事业而毫不松懈的可贵精神，铿锵的英武的话语，鼓舞着每一个苏联人民——我们的榜样——，他们一再说：“每个人多做一分工作，就是为和平多尽一分力量”。为着和平，为着共产主义事业，为着光芒万丈的人类解放事业。马克思列宁主义掌握在劳动人民手里，就会变成为无比强大、不可战胜的力量。
    苏联人民一切为了社会主义，为了共产主义。自己从不知道有什么值得考虑架子的必要。坐过国际列车的人会看见我们尊敬的苏联专家他们每在停车时自己下站购买食品；到过工厂和工地的同志，会看见苏联专家亲自挽起袖子油渍满身的和工人在一块干活；参观过苏联大印刷厂的人会看见他们把最新的机器让给兄弟国家而自己却留用旧的。也许有人会指出莫斯科某个房子的外表已经很陈旧了，或者说，他们某些展览馆、陈列室是利用旧建筑的，但那些沾沾自得的先生们有意“忘记”或低能地无知于苏联许许多多的科学、技术的伟大成就——许许多多世界第一的成就——却偷偷地闭着眼睛，自欺欺人的在耳边低声说：“苏联很差，苏联很不成”。这蚊声或者想成雷？！然而雷绝不是蚊！它现在造成地球卫星，在人类历史上记下了新的一页。庆祝十月革命四十周年，我们也为社会主义阵营的首领——苏联的伟大成就而衷诚庆贺其日益辉煌灿烂地显耀其劳动成果！
