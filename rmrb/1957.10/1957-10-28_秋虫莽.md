    Autumn Insects

    "I only hear in the fields, grasshoppers like wind and rain." - Su Shi: "Dongpo"
    Locust
    It actually flew onto my desk. Its arrogant appearance is really funny. Its head is facing me, as if showing off the "king" character on its head; its two large legs are propped up high, seemingly deliberately challenging me.
    I can't help but think of the time when I was a child catching grasshoppers in the cornfield. I chased desperately, but I could never catch it. Another one would jump out to lure me, and I would run to chase that one. Gradually, I learned a little trick. When I found a big grasshopper, I pretended not to see it. Then, slowly, gently, and quietly, I walked over, went behind it, and then unexpectedly slapped it down with my little palm. I finally caught a lot of grasshoppers and tied their thighs with string. Some grasshoppers broke free of their thighs and still ran away. So, I learned a little trick, and later I tied their necks with string. ...
    For a long time, I didn't understand what a locust plague was, and I hadn't seen what it looked like when locusts occurred on a large scale. Only from the "color change when talking about tigers" look on the faces of the elderly when they talked about "locusts passing" in a certain year, my young mind felt that it was a very terrible thing. Like a howling gale, like dark clouds filling the sky, like hailstones falling to the ground. In a day and a half, the locusts passed, and the crops in the field were bare. And then? How many people abandoned their homes and fled famine, how many families were broken and destroyed!
    Later, I heard comrades talk about the heroic feat of hundreds of thousands of people in the Taihang Mountains surrounding and suppressing locusts during the Anti-Japanese War, and I knew that in the face of the liberated people, even the most powerful locust swarms were not to be feared. Later, I learned that we can detect locust situations in advance, and we can also use airplanes to spray medicinal powder, so that locusts die wherever they occur. According to reports: "The area where summer locusts occurred and spread this year is the largest since liberation. ... After a tense battle, by the end of June, the summer locusts in various locust areas were basically eliminated, and they did not take off and become a disaster." Yes, June, a tense month of battle! I am even more convinced that even if locusts form a swarm, they are not to be feared.
    Therefore, looking at the arrogant appearance of the locust that flew onto my desk, I find it particularly funny. What should I do with it? Kill it? Just this lonely one, it's also quite pitiful. Looking at it carefully, I think it looks quite delicate and majestic. Let it go, I'll just read my newspaper. ...
      "New developments in autumn locusts!" Several bold black headlines on the newspaper appeared before my eyes, and I read on: "... Locust eggs in the lakeside locust areas have begun to hatch, ... some have already become insects and are mating and laying eggs. ... Agricultural cooperative members in various places have been organized and are投入入投入投入投入入投入投入投入投入入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入投入紧急的灭蝗战斗。” (into an emergency locust extermination battle.)"
    I hurriedly searched for the flying locust on the desk again, but I couldn't see it anymore. Finally, I found it in the corner of the room again. I walked over lightly and quietly, just like when I was a child, and stepped on it, turning it into mud!
    Inchworm
    Look how much it pretends! From a distance, it really looks like a branch. The angle it extends is exactly the same as other branches. Even the color of its body is so similar to other branches. Other branches have light red stripes in the green, and its green body also has those two light red stripes. It doesn't move at all, standing there. If I hadn't read the "mimicry" section in biology, I might have been deceived by it.
    I wanted to let the children gain some knowledge, so I called a child over and pointed to the "branch" and asked her, "Look, what is there here?" "Nothing, you're just lying!" "Look more closely." She looked at it, then widened her eyes and thought for a while, then suddenly smiled: "I know, I know! The storybook talked about it, it's in the book 'Doll Finding Clothes'. The doll was also deceived by it! Thinking it was a branch, she grabbed it and climbed up, and suddenly fell down! What was it called? ... I forgot."
    A slightly older child wearing a red scarf heard us talking about it with interest and ran over.
      "This! Our textbooks also talked about it. ..."
      "It's one thing to talk about it in books; but if you encounter it and no one points it out, can you find it and recognize it?"
    The two children stared at the "branch" without answering, seemingly looking at what characteristics it had.
    The older child suddenly shouted: "Look, the leaves, the leaves, many of them are broken, it must have bitten them!"
    Yes! No matter how much it pretends, it can't help but eat leaves. It pretends to be a branch precisely to make it easier to eat leaves. If the leaves of a plant are bitten, that tells you: there are insects there. Search carefully, insects can never hide from people's eyes. If you can't find them on the branches and leaves, look on the ground, see where there are holes.
    The little child picked up a small stick to poke the disguised "branch". It still held the "branch" where it "grew" tightly with its two feet, unwilling to let go. The child finally picked it down and sent it to the old hen.
          Moth
    I don't know when it earned the beautiful name of "loving light". It has become even more arrogant because of this.
    Tonight, it flew to my lamp again, fluttering and flying around, making people very annoyed!
    Eight or nine years ago, in the villages at the foot of the Taihang Mountains, it often patronized us. Many nights, as soon as the lamp was lit, just as I was about to write something, it came. That was no longer an era of extreme hardship; but it still had to be said to be an era of considerable hardship, right? To save some oil, only one lampwick could be placed in each lamp. Matches were finally available, but lighting one more felt a bit painful. The dim light, as small as a bean, was extinguished with a flutter. After lighting it again for a while, it came again. It was always difficult to close the door so tightly, and the window paper was always inevitably a little torn; it didn't know how it saw some gaps and squeezed in, annoying, annoying, so many beautiful thoughts were interrupted by it.
    I even felt annoyed as soon as I saw its appearance. Neither black nor white nor yellow, like a small piece of rotten wood dug out of a grave, without any bright color. Its wings were quite large, and seemed quite powerful, but it was simply born to extinguish the light. No wonder people in my hometown called this kind of moth "ghost shaman".
    It's here again. Flutter, flutter, ...唠唠叨叨宣布: (naggingly announcing): Look, how much I love light! I love light so much that I'm not afraid of being buried in the fire pit, I love light so much that I've gone crazy! ...
    Flutter, flutter, ... It's really a crazy dance. If it doesn't extinguish the light once, it will come again, ...
    I am annoyed, and I am also happy, a kind of happiness that seems like revenge.
    I watched it flutter until it was exhausted, crawling on the ground, and became still.
    It can never extinguish the light again. It may never understand what is going on, even until it dies.
    We now use electric lights—Soviet farmers call them "Ilyich lamps" to honor Lenin for bringing light to mankind. Lenin's light, no demon, no "ghost shaman" can extinguish it.

    秋虫莽
    燕凌
    但闻畦垅间，蚱蜢如风雨。——苏　轼：“东　坡”
    蝗
    它居然飞到我的桌上来了。那副倨傲的样子，看起来实在好笑。头正对着我，似乎在炫耀它头上的“王”字；两条大腿高高撑起，俨然是存心挑战。
    我不禁想起我小时候在玉米地里捉蚂蚱的情形。我拚命追，总是追不上它。另外一只又跳出来引诱我，我就跑着去追另一只。渐渐地，我学了一点乖。发现一只大蚂蚱，就装着没看见它的样子。然后，慢慢地轻轻地悄悄地走过去，绕到它的背后，然后出其不意地用小巴掌拍下去。我终于捉到了不少蚂蚱，用线拴住它们的大腿。有些蚂蚱挣脱了大腿，还是逃跑了。于是，我又学了些乖，以后就用线拴住它们的脖颈。……
    很长时期，我不懂得什么叫蝗灾，没见过蝗虫大发生的时候是个什么样子。只是从老年人谈起某某年“过蚂蚱”的时候那种“谈虎色变”的脸色看来，幼小的心灵就感觉到那是万分可怕的事情。如狂风呼啸，如乌云满天，如冰雹落地。一天半天，蚂蚱过去了，地里的庄稼也就光秃秃的了。接着呢？多少人弃家逃荒，多少户家破人亡！
    后来，听到同志们谈太行山区抗日时期几十万人围剿蝗虫的壮举，知道在解放了的人民面前，再厉害的蝗群也是不足怕的了。再后来，又知道了我们已经可以侦察蝗情，事先预防，还可以用飞机撒布药粉，蝗虫在哪里发生，就让它们在哪里死亡。报载：“今年夏蝗发生和扩散的面积，是解放后最大的一年。……经过紧张的战斗，到六月底，各个蝗区的夏蝗即被基本消灭，没有起飞成灾。”是啊，六月，紧张的战斗的六月啊！我更确信，蝗虫即使结成了群也是不足怕的了。
    因此，看着那只飞到我的桌上来的蝗虫的倨傲的样子，我觉得分外好笑。我该怎么对付它呢？拍死它吗？就这么孤孤单单的一只，也怪可怜的。仔细看看，又觉得它长得倒很精致、威武。随它去吧，我还是看我的报。……
      “秋蝗有新发展！”报上的几个粗黑的标题字出现在我眼前，我看了下去：“……沿湖蝗区蝗卵开始孵化，……有的已经成虫，正在交配产卵。……已组织各地农业社社员，投入紧急的灭蝗战斗。……”
    我急忙又向桌上搜寻那只飞蝗，可是，已经看不到它了。终于在屋角里又找到它，我又像小时候那样，轻轻地悄悄地走过去，一脚把它踩成肉泥！
    尺蠖
    你看它装得多像啊！远远看去，的确是一个枝子。伸出去的角度，同别的枝子一模一样。甚至身上的颜色，也同别的枝子那么相像。别的枝子上绿色中有淡红的条纹，它的绿色的身上也有那么两条淡红的条纹。它一动也不动，挺在那里。我要是没有读过生物学上“拟态”那一节，很可能就要被它骗过去了。
    我想让孩子们长点见识，叫一个孩子过来，指着这个“枝子”问她：“你看，这里有个什么东西？”“什么也没有，你净骗人！”“你再仔细看看。”她看了看，又瞪大眼睛想了一想，忽然笑了：“我知道，我知道！故事书上讲过，‘洋娃娃找衣服’那本书上就有。洋娃娃还叫它骗了呢！当是枝子，扳着往上爬，一下子跌下来了！它叫个什么来着？……我忘啦。”
    一个系着红领巾的大一些的孩子，听到我们讲得有趣，也跑过来了。
      “这个呀！我们的课本上也讲过。……”
      “书上讲过是讲过；可是，要是碰到了它，没有人指出来，你们能不能找出它来，认出它来？”
    两个孩子凝视着那个“枝子”，没有回答，似乎是在看看它究竟有什么特点。
    大孩子忽然嚷了起来：“你看，叶子，叶子，好多都破了，一定是它咬坏的！”
    是啊！它装得再像，也不能不吃叶子。它装作枝子，正是为了吃叶子方便。一棵植物的叶子被咬了，那就是告诉你：那里有虫。仔细去搜寻吧，虫永远也瞒不过人的眼睛。枝叶上找不到，就看地上吧，看哪里有洞。
    小孩子拾起一根小棍棍去拨弄那个伪装的“枝子”。它还用两只脚紧紧抱着它“生长”在那里的“枝子，不肯放松。孩子终于把它挑了下来，送到了老母鸡面前。
          扑灯蛾
    不知道从什么时候起，它骗得了“爱光明”的美名。它也就因此更加骄横了。
    今天夜里，它又飞到了我的灯前，扑扑楞楞，飞来飞去，叫人好不心烦！
    八九年前，在太行山下的乡村里，它就时常光顾我们。许多夜里，刚点上灯，正要写些什么，它来了。那已经不是万分艰苦的年代了；可是，也还得说是十分艰苦的年代吧？为了省一些油，每盏灯里只能放一根灯草。火柴总算是有了，可是多划一根也觉得有些心疼。萤萤如豆的灯光，它一扑就息灭。再点上不一会儿，它又来了。门总难关得那么严，窗纸也总难免有些破；它不知怎么瞅到一些缝，就钻了进来，可恼呀可恼，多少美好的思绪，都被它打断了。
    我甚至一看到它的样子就厌烦。黑不黑，白不白，黄不黄，像坟墓里挖出来的一小块烂木头，没有一点鲜明的颜色。翅膀倒挺大，也似乎挺有劲，可是，简直生来就是为了把灯光扑灭。难怪家乡的人把它这样的飞蛾叫做“鬼师婆”。
    它又来了。扑拉拉，扑拉拉，……唠唠叨叨地宣告：看呀，我是多么热爱光明！我爱光明爱得不怕葬身火窟，我爱光明爱得简直发了疯！……
    扑拉拉，扑拉拉，……真是一次疯狂的舞蹈。一次没有扑灭灯光，就再来一次，……
    我心烦，我也愉快，是一种似乎复了仇似的愉快。
    我看着它扑得精疲力竭，匍匐在地，静止下来。
    灯光，它是再也扑灭不了的了。它也许至死也难理解这是怎么回事。
    我们现在用的是电灯——苏联农民为了敬爱把光明带给人类的列宁，把它叫做“伊里奇灯”。列宁的灯光，什么恶魔、“鬼师婆”也扑灭不了它。
