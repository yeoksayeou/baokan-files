    The Great Victory of Proletarian Internationalism
    —Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution
    Yao Zhen Wang Li

    The conscious working class and all sincere revolutionaries around the world are jubilantly celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This is a grand festival celebrating the victory of Marxism-Leninism, a review of the strength of socialist countries and the international communist movement; it is also a celebration of the victory of proletarian internationalism, a review of the friendly cooperation of socialist countries and the international solidarity of working people around the world.
    The victory of the October Revolution was achieved under the guidance of Leninism's theory of socialist revolution. This revolutionary theory regarded the Russian Revolution as part of the world proletarian revolution, as a result of the development of various contradictions in the imperialist world system, and as a result of the breaking of the chain of the world imperialist front in one country. At the same time, the great October Revolution linked the struggles of the oppressed classes and oppressed nations in all countries around the world. Its great significance lies not only in breaking through the imperialist system in one country, but also in its being the beginning and a strong foundation for the continued development of a global revolution to overthrow all systems of exploitation and oppression.
    Proletarian internationalism is one of the ideological principles of Marxism-Leninism and a powerful weapon for the proletariat to liberate all mankind. As early as the beginning of the communist movement, Marx and Engels put forward the idea of international proletarian solidarity. In order to unite the working classes of various countries to fight together, the founders of Marxism made tremendous efforts not only in theory but also in practice. Later, when the opportunists of the Second International betrayed the principles of proletarian internationalism and embarked on the path of social chauvinism, Lenin led the conscious working classes of all countries to resolutely fight against the social chauvinism of the Second International, defend and develop proletarian internationalism. Lenin repeatedly pointed out that the invincible force of the communist movement lies first and foremost in the international unity of the working class and its revolutionary vanguard. Workers of all nations and countries, due to their special position in society and the conditions for fighting against capital, should strive to achieve the closest unity and brotherly solidarity. Lenin said: "The interests of labor require the most complete trust and the closest union between the workers of all countries and nationalities. ... We are against national hatred, national strife, and national particularism. We are internationalists." Lenin especially emphasized: "Workers who are scattered are powerless; workers who are united are all-powerful."
    The victory of the October Revolution opened up the path of liberation for the proletariat around the world, and also opened up the path of liberation for all oppressed nations. It gave the working people of all countries tremendous strength and enhanced their confidence in the victory of the struggle. It also led to an unprecedented upsurge in the national liberation movements in the colonies and dependent countries. The October Revolution built a revolutionary front from the Western proletariat through the Russian Revolution to the oppressed nations of the East against world imperialism. This is a world revolutionary front headed by the Soviet Union, and also an internationalist revolutionary front. For the forty years since the October Revolution, the Soviet people, the conscious working classes of the world, and all sincere revolutionaries have been supporting and helping each other under the banner of internationalism, making this great world revolutionary front consolidated and developed.
    For the forty years since the October Revolution, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have resolutely implemented the principles of proletarian internationalism and have made extremely great efforts to assist the cause of the people of all countries. This is something that the people of all countries in the world will never forget.
    The existence and development of the socialist Soviet Union is in itself an assistance to the world revolutionary movement. Lenin said that the proletariat in the country that first won the socialist revolution, by expropriating the capitalists and organizing socialist production in its own country, would attract the oppressed classes of other countries to its side. The greatest help that the Soviet Union has provided to the world revolution is precisely reflected here. This is also what Lenin said: "To carry out to the highest degree what can be achieved in one country, in order to develop, promote and excite the revolutions in all countries of the world." The Soviet people, in the serious difficulties of being surrounded by world capitalism, in the absence of precedents and models to learn from, and on the basis of a relatively backward economy, built the world's first great socialist country after extremely arduous struggles. The Soviet people, with their hard work, turned scientific socialism from an ideal and a theory into a living reality, and from their specific practice, provided many of the most valuable basic experiences for other countries embarking on the path of socialism. This is the greatest assistance to the revolutionary cause of other countries. The Soviet people, with living facts, proved to the working people and all oppressed nations of the world how superior and correct the road opened up by the October Revolution is, making the revolutionary workers' movements of various countries and the liberation movements of all oppressed nations gain infinite hope, confidence and courage, and the rule of imperialism has therefore undergone fundamental shake-ups. It is precisely because of this that for the forty years since the October Revolution, the ideas of Marxism-Leninism and communism have become increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people of all countries. On the eve of the October Revolution in 1917, there were only 250,000 Communist Party members in the whole of Russia. At the beginning of World War II, there were Communist Parties in forty-three countries, including the Soviet Union, with a total of 4.2 million members. By the end of World War II, the number of countries with Communist and Workers' Parties had increased to seventy-six, with a total membership of over 20 million. Now, the total number of Communist Party members in various countries of the world has exceeded 33 million. The Communist and Workers' Parties of thirteen socialist countries have become ruling parties. In capitalist countries, there are now sixty-three Communist Parties, with a total membership of approximately 5 million. The prestige of the Communist Parties of various countries continues to grow, and the world trade union movement is becoming increasingly magnificent. All of this shows that Marxism-Leninism and communism have become an irresistible trend; it also shows how great an impact the existence and development of the Soviet Union has had on the cause of liberation of the people of the whole world.
    The distinct internationalist banner of the October Revolution pointed out to the people of the world the path to fundamentally eliminate war among mankind, and also set a standard for the proletariat and working people of the world to distinguish between just and unjust wars. Resolutely opposing imperialist aggression, striving to maintain world peace, opposing all unjust wars, and supporting all just wars; this is an important sign of proletarian internationalism. For the forty years since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has consistently implemented Lenin's policy of defending peace and opposing war. As early as the second day of the October Revolution, November 8, 1917, the Second Congress of the All-Russian Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies adopted the Decree on Peace drafted by Lenin, and soon put forward a program for establishing genuine friendship and equality among countries. These documents became the basis of the Soviet state's foreign policy of maintaining peace and striving for equality among all nations. Before World War II, the Soviet Union constantly opposed the expansion of armaments and exposed the war conspiracies of imperialist monopoly groups. After World War II, the Soviet Union repeatedly put forward proposals for disarmament and banning the use of weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet Union and all socialist countries have consistently cooperated with all peace-loving forces, consistently advocated resolving all international disputes peacefully, and have made a series of extremely important contributions to easing international tensions. Now, the Soviet Union's struggle for peace, the struggle for peaceful coexistence and economic competition among countries with different social systems, has echoed the huge movement of various countries to safeguard world peace, forming a powerful force to stop imperialist aggressive wars. The cause of world peace has a brighter future. Of course, the Soviet Union, socialist countries, and all peace-loving forces in the world strive for peace not because of our weakness, as the imperialist aggressors say. The people of all countries in the world clearly know that when the imperialist aggressor forces must impose war on the people, when war becomes inevitable, it is necessary to resolutely oppose all unjust wars, and unconditionally sympathize with and support all just wars. Because this just war is precisely for the purpose of defending world peace and safeguarding the interests of mankind. Mankind will never forget that the Soviet people and their armed forces were the main force in the anti-fascist war. They saved mankind from fascist enslavement and completely defeated the most brutal team of the imperialist aggression group. In particular, after the heroic Soviet army cooperated with the people of relevant countries to liberate Eastern European countries and part of Central Europe, the people's forces in these regions have achieved smooth development, and the establishment of people's democratic systems in these countries has also achieved important conditions. The Soviet Union also provided strong support for China's war of resistance against Japan, and in the final stage gave a devastating blow to the elite troops of Japanese imperialism gathered in Northeast China, liberating Northeast China and northern Korea, greatly helping the cause of the people of China and other Asian countries. Because the Soviet people fulfilled their internationalist obligations with their blood, because the world revolutionary united front headed by the Soviet Union defeated the three fascist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and greatly developed and consolidated the forces of socialism and people's revolution, reducing and weakening the positions of imperialism and reactionary forces. The entire historical process after World War II has also undergone profound changes favorable to the people of the world. The long dikes of imperialism are collapsing everywhere, and the world's revolutionary workers' movements and the national movements of colonial peoples have become an irresistible torrent.
    As time goes by, the international significance of the October Revolution is becoming more profound and clear. After World War II, the international communist movement became even more magnificent. The working people of many countries in Europe and Asia established their own socialist countries and formed a socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Socialism has stepped out of the scope of one country and become a world system opposed to world imperialism. Before World War II, the territory of socialist countries accounted for only 17% of the world, the population accounted for about 9% of the world, and the industrial output accounted for about one-tenth of the world; now, the territory of socialist countries has accounted for 26% of the world, the population accounts for about 35% of the world, and the industrial output accounts for about one-third of the world. A new type of truly equal and friendly international relations has been established between socialist countries. This new type of international relations is unprecedented in human history, and its foundation is Marxism-Leninism, internationalism and the principle of national equality. In this regard, the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, has also made important contributions. The Soviet Union's generous help and support is an important condition for the rapid socialist transformation and socialist construction of the people's democratic countries. When the people's democratic countries faced various difficulties in the early days of liberation, the Soviet Union provided various assistance to help them overcome temporary difficulties. In the years when the people's democratic countries were restoring their national economies and carrying out planned construction, the Soviet Union provided these countries with sincere and systematic assistance, greatly promoting the restoration of these countries' national economies and the progress of socialist industrialization. The total amount of long-term loans granted by the Soviet Union to other socialist countries on the most favorable terms is nearly 30 billion rubles. The total number of the most modern factories and enterprises established by the Soviet Union in other countries under the treaties has reached more than 300, and the total number will reach 478 before 1962, as well as more than 120 separate workshops and other technical installations. Taking the Soviet Union's assistance to China as an example, according to the Sino-Soviet agreement, the Soviet Union is assisting China in building 211 enterprises and 21 separate workshops, the total value of the equipment of which amounts to 8.1 billion rubles. The main method by which the Soviet Union provides assistance and economic mutual assistance to socialist countries is through equal, mutually beneficial and close cooperative trade relations. Through the channel of foreign trade, the Soviet Union exports a large number of machinery and equipment, metals, materials, raw materials, medicines and daily necessities to other socialist countries. The Soviet Union has also implemented scientific and technological cooperation with other socialist countries, and frequently exchanges technical experience in production and construction. The Soviet Union has also helped friendly countries organize the production of atomic energy and helped them use atomic energy peacefully. All of these have extremely important significance for the economic development of socialist countries. At the same time, when the imperialist aggressive groups are actively preparing to attack the forces of world peace, democracy, and socialism, the Soviet Union, which has strong economic and military forces, has formed an unbreakable alliance with other socialist countries. In the struggle against imperialist aggression, the socialist camp has the obligation to assist each other, and the defense capability of each socialist country is based on the strength of the entire socialist camp. It is precisely because of this that the war plans of the imperialist aggressive groups have been severely hit, and the security of socialist countries has been reliably guaranteed. The whole world can see that when the imperialists and the domestic reactionary forces in Hungary carried out counter-revolutionary subversive activities aimed at overthrowing the Hungarian people's democratic system and socialist achievements last year, when the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, representing the will and national interests of the people, requested Soviet assistance, the heroic Soviet people, like they had helped the Hungarian people to gain liberation in the past, sent their troops to assist the Hungarian people and crushed the conspiracies of the imperialists and counter-revolutionaries. Other socialist countries also gave great support and assistance to the Hungarian people. It is precisely this loyalty to proletarian internationalism that guarantees that the powerful socialist camp becomes the iron wall of world peace and the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.
    Since the purpose of the communist movement is to eliminate all exploitative systems, it is of course opposed to any national oppression. The revolutionary proletariat believes that a nation that oppresses other nations cannot be free, and equality among all nations is a principle that the proletariat must follow. Therefore, it has become the basic principle and requirement of the proletarian revolutionary movement for the proletariat of the world to support each other and strive to assist all oppressed nations. Lenin pointed out: "The socialist revolution will not only and mainly be the struggle of the revolutionary proletarians in each country against their own bourgeoisie; no, this revolution will be the struggle of all colonies and countries oppressed by imperialism, of all dependent countries against international imperialism." He repeatedly pointed out that the nations of the East are no longer the object of imperialist wealth, but an important part of participating in solving the fate of all mankind, or even the greatest guarantee that determines the inevitable victory of the world revolution. As early as 1916, Lenin said: "We are striving to get close to and get along with the Mongols, Persians, Indians, and Egyptians. We consider it our duty and our interest to implement this, because without this, European socialism will be unstable." After the victory of the October Revolution, Lenin, starting from the fundamental interests of the Russian working people and the working people of the whole world, put forward the resounding call of "equality among all nations" and "support for the liberation struggle of all nations." For the forty years since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has resolutely and unswervingly supported the cause of liberation of the people of all colonial and semi-colonial countries. From the very beginning of its establishment, the Soviet state extended a hand of brotherhood and friendship to China, Iran, Turkey and other Eastern countries, abolished all the unequal treaties concluded in the Tsarist era, cancelled the privileges of the Tsarist government, and declared an alliance with the Eastern countries in the struggle for national independence; and the people of the Eastern countries have also accepted the influence of the October Revolution to varying degrees and at different speeds, and set off a tidal wave of national liberation movements one after another. Especially in the twelve years since World War II, half of the world's population, that is, more than 1.3 billion people, have been freed from the status of colonial dependent countries. Among them, in addition to China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, together with the Mongolian People's Republic, which had been liberated before World War II, have chosen the path of development of the socialist system. India, Burma, Indonesia, Egypt, Syria, and many other countries have also broken away from the colonial system and embarked on the path of national independent development. The era in which Eastern countries were oppressed and dominated by imperialist colonial forces has gone forever. The great development and the victories gained in the national liberation movement of colonial and semi-colonial countries are inseparable from the October Revolution and the Soviet Union generated by the October Revolution. The great Soviet Union's support for the national liberation movements of various countries and its strike against the reactionary forces of international imperialism are important factors in the victory of the national liberation movements of all countries. In order to consolidate the independent status of the Eastern countries, the Soviet Union is also providing political, economic, and cultural assistance to the Asian and African countries that have gained independence. This attitude of the Soviet Union is clearly and consistently expressed in its diplomatic policy. The Soviet Union firmly supports the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence" proposed by China, India, Burma, etc., firmly supports the Bandung Conference resolution of Asian and African countries, and constantly supports all national independence movements against colonialism at various UN meetings and other international conferences, and fully supports the struggle of Asian and African countries and other countries against imperialist aggression and for the striving for and safeguarding of national independence. When the British and French imperialists instigated Israel and launched a war of aggression against Egypt with the consent of the American imperialists, the Soviet government did not hesitate to announce the adoption of firm measures to stop the aggression, which played an extremely important role in defending Egypt's independent status, restoring peace in the Near East and preventing the Third World War. The Soviet Union resolutely and ruthlessly exposed the aggressive face of the Eisenhower Doctrine towards the Middle East, especially recently exposing the American planning and collusion with Turkey to deploy a war of aggression against Syria. The Soviet Union announced that it would take all necessary measures to assist Syria in resisting the aggressors. All this shows that the Soviet Union has always been the most sincere friend of the small and weak nations of the East. Because of the existence of a powerful Soviet Union and its consistent and clear policy of supporting and protecting the national independence movement, the Asian and African countries that have just gained independent status have been able to maintain their independent status. In addition, the Soviet Union's economic support and assistance to these countries also has special importance in helping them further consolidate their independent status. The Soviet Union's assistance does not entail any political or military conditions, which is fundamentally different from the enslaving assistance of the imperialists. The Soviet Union's assistance to India in building a metallurgical plant with an annual output of more than one million tons of steel is a typical manifestation of this cooperation. This fact shows that in order to obtain modern industrial equipment and other necessary commodities, Eastern countries do not need to rely on begging for a living from the imperialists. Moreover, due to the assistance of the Soviet Union and socialist countries, the imperialists are forced to make some concessions to the Eastern countries in politics and trade. The enslaving nature of the imperialists' so-called "assistance" has been further exposed to the people of the Eastern countries; and the great role of the great Soviet Union in supporting the independence of the Eastern countries and safeguarding peace has become even clearer to the people of all countries.

    无产阶级国际主义的伟大胜利
    ——庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年
    姚溱　王力
    全世界觉悟的工人阶级和一切真诚革命的人们，都在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。这是庆祝马克思列宁主义的胜利，检阅社会主义国家和国际共产主义运动力量的盛大节日；也是庆祝无产阶级国际主义的胜利，检阅社会主义国家的友好合作和全世界劳动人民国际团结的盛大节日。
    十月革命的胜利，是在列宁主义关于社会主义革命的理论指导下取得的。这个革命理论把俄国革命看做是世界无产阶级革命的一部分，看做是帝国主义世界体系中各种矛盾发展的结果，看做是世界帝
  国主义战线链条在一个国家破裂的结果。同时，伟大的十月革命又把全世界一切国家中被压迫阶级和被压迫民族的斗争联系起来，它的伟大意义不仅是在一个国家中冲破了帝国主义的体系，而且它是推翻一切剥削和压迫制度的世界性革命的开始和继续发展的强大基础。
      无产阶级国际主义是马克思列宁主义的思想原则之一，是无产阶级解放全人类的斗争的有力武器。早在共产主义运动初期，马克思、恩格斯就提出了国际无产阶级团结的思想。马克思主义的创始者为了把各国工人阶级团结起来共同进行斗争，不仅从理论方面而且在实践方面作了巨大的努力。后来，当第二国际的机会主义者背叛了无产阶级国际主义的原则，走上社会沙文主义的道路时，列宁就领导了各国觉悟的工人阶级，对第二国际社会沙文主义进行了坚决的斗争，保卫并发展了无产阶级的国际主义。列宁一再指出：共产主义运动不可战胜的力量，首先就在于工人阶级及其革命先锋队的国际团结。所有各民族和国家的工人，由于本身在社会中所处的特殊地位和进行反对资本的斗争条件，应该努力达到最紧密的联合和兄弟般的团结。列宁说：“劳动的利益要求各国和各个民族的劳动者之间要有最充分的信任和最紧密的联合。……我们是反对民族仇视、民族纠纷、民族特殊化的。我们是国际主义者。”列宁特别强调：“分散的工人——一无所能，团结的工人——无所不能”。
    十月革命的胜利开辟了全世界无产阶级解放的道路，也开辟了一切被压迫民族解放的道路。它使各国劳动人民获得了巨大的力量，增强了斗争胜利的信心，它也使得各殖民地和附属国的民族解放运动有了空前的高涨。十月革命建筑了一条从西方无产者经过俄国革命到东方被压迫民族的反对世界帝国主义的革命战线。这是一条以苏联为首的世界革命战线，也是一条国际主义的革命战线。十月革命四十年来，苏联人民和全世界觉悟的工人阶级以及一切真诚革命的人们，就是在国际主义的旗帜下，互相支持，互相帮助，使得这条伟大的世界革命战线，得到了巩固和发展。
    十月革命四十年来，苏联人民在苏联共产党领导之下，坚决地贯彻无产阶级国际主义的原则，对于援助各国人民的事业，作了极其巨大的努力。这是世界各国人民永远不会忘记的。
    社会主义苏联的存在和发展，其本身就是对世界革命运动的一种援助。列宁说过：首先获得了社会主义革命胜利的国家中的无产阶级，剥夺了资本家，并在本国内组织了社会主义生产，就会把其他各国被压迫的阶级吸引到自己方面来。苏联对世界革命提供的最大帮助，正就表现在这里。这也正是列宁所说：“最高限度地实行一个国家内所能实现的事情，以便发展、推动和激动世界各国的革命”。苏联人民是在世界资本主义包围的严重困难中，在没有先例和榜样可资借镜的情况下，在原来比较落后的经济基础上，经过极其艰难困苦的奋斗，建成了世界上第一个伟大的社会主义国家。苏联人民以自己的艰苦劳动，把科学的社会主义从一种理想和理论变成活生生的现实，并且从自己的具体实践中，为其他走向社会主义的国家，提供了许多最宝贵的基本经验，这便是对于其他国家的革命事业最伟大的援助。苏联人民以活生生的事实，向全世界劳动人民和一切被压迫民族证明了十月革命所开辟的道路是如何优越和正确，使得各国革命工人运动和一切被压迫民族的解放运动获得了无限的希望、信心和勇气，帝国主义的统治也因此而发生了根本的动摇。正是因为这样，十月革命四十年来，马克思列宁主义的思想和共产主义的思想已经在世界各国日益深入人心。在1917年十月革命前夜，全俄国的共产党员不过二十五万人。在第二次世界大战开始时，包括苏联在内的四十三个国家里有了共产党，党员共有四百二十万人。在第二次世界大战结束时，有共产党和工人党的国家增加到七十六国，党员总数超过两千万人。现在，世界各国的共产党员总数已经超过三千三百万人。十三个社会主义国家的共产党和工人党已经成为执政党。在资本主义国家里，现在有六十三个共产党，党员人数共约五百万人。各国共产党的威信不断增涨，世界的职工运动波澜日益壮阔。所有这一切，都说明了马克思列宁主义和共产主义已经成为不可抗拒的潮流；也说明了苏联的存在和发展对于全世界人民解放事业发生了多么巨大的影响。
    十月革命的鲜明的国际主义旗帜，向全世界人民指出了在人类中根本消灭战争的道路，也给全世界无产阶级和劳动人民树立了区分正义战争和非正义战争的标准。坚决反对帝国主义侵略、努力维护世界和平，反对一切非正义的战争、拥护一切正义的战争；这正是无产阶级国际主义的一项重要标志。十月革命四十年来，苏联一贯地执行着列宁的保卫和平反对战争的政策。早在十月革命的第二天，1917年11月8日，全俄工兵代表苏维埃第二次代表大会就通过了列宁起草的和平法令，不久又提出了建立各国真正友好平等的纲领。这些文件，成了苏维埃国家维护和平和争取各民族平等的对外政策的基础。在第二次世界大战以前，苏联曾经不断地反对扩张军备，揭露帝国主义垄断集团的战争阴谋。第二次世界大战以后，苏联又多次提出裁军和禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器的建议。苏联和所有的社会主义国家一贯同一切爱好和平的力量合作，一贯主张以和平方式解决一切国际纠纷，并且对于缓和国际紧张局势作出了一系列的极其重大的贡献。现在，苏联争取和平的斗争，争取社会制度不同的国家和平共处并实行经济竞赛的斗争，已经同各国人民维护世界和平的巨大运动相互呼应，形成了强大的制止帝国主义侵略战争的力量。世界和平事业，已经有了更光明的前景。当然，苏联、社会主义各国和全世界一切爱好和平的力量努力争取和平，并不是像帝国主义侵略者所说，是由于我们的力量薄弱。世界各国人民清楚地知道：当帝国主义侵略势力一定要把战争强加在人民头上的时候，当战争变得不可避免的时候，就必须坚决反对一切不义的战争，无条件地同情和支持一切正义的战争。因为这种正义的战争，正是为了保卫世界和平和保障人类利益的目的。人类永远不会忘记苏联人民及其武装力量是反法西斯战争的主力军，他们拯救了世界人类免于受法西斯奴役，彻底打败了帝国主义侵略集团中最残暴的队伍。特别是，英勇的苏联军队同有关各国的人民合作，解放了东欧各国和中欧一部以后，这些地区的人民力量获得了顺利的发展，这些国家中建立人民民主制度也就取得了重要的条件。苏联对于我国的抗日战争也作了有力的支援，并且在最后阶段给了日本帝国主义集结在我国东北的精锐部队以歼灭性的打击，解放了我国的东北部和朝鲜的北部，大大帮助了我国和亚洲其他国家的人民事业。由于苏联人民用自己的鲜血履行了国际主义的义务，由于以苏联为首的世界革命统一战线战胜了德、意、日三个法西斯国家，大大发展和巩固了社会主义和人民革命的力量，缩小和削弱了帝国主义和反动势力的阵地。第二次世界大战以后的整个历史进程，也就发生了有利于世界人民的深刻变化。帝国主义的长堤到处溃决，全世界的革命工人运动和殖民地人民的民族运动已经成为不可抗拒的洪流了。
    随着时间的推移，十月革命的国际意义是显得更加深刻和显明了。在第二次世界大战以后，国际共产主义运动更加波澜壮阔了，欧亚两洲许多国家的劳动人民建立了自己的社会主义国家，并且结成了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营。社会主义已经越出了一国的范围而成为一个同世界帝国主义相对立的世界体系。在第二次世界大战以前，社会主义国家的领土只占全世界的17％，人口约占全世界的9％，工业产量约占全世界的十分之一；现在，各社会主义国家的领土已占全世界的26％，人口约占全世界的35％，工业产量约占全世界的三分之一。在社会主义国家之间，建立了新型的、真正平等友好合作的国际关系。这种新型的国际关系在人类历史上是空前的，它的基础就是马克思列宁主义，就是国际主义和民族平等的原则。在这一方面，第一个社会主义国家苏联也作出了重要的贡献。苏联的慷慨帮助和支持，是各人民民主国家迅速地进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设的一个重要条件。当各人民民主国家在解放初期面临各种困难的时候，苏联就给予各种援助，帮助渡过暂时的困难。在各人民民主国家恢复国民经济和进行计划建设的年代里，苏联又向这些国家提供真诚的、系统的援助，大大促进了这些国家国民经济的恢复和社会主义工业化的进展。苏联根据最优惠的条件给予其他社会主义国家的长期贷款，总数已近三百亿卢布。苏联根据缔结的条约帮助其他国家建立的最新式工厂企业总数已达三百多个，到1962年以前总数将达到四百七十八项，还有一百二十多个单独的车间和其他技术装置。以苏联帮助我国的情况来说，根据中苏两国协议，苏联协助我国建立二百一十一项企业和二十一个单独车间，其装备总值即达八十一亿卢布。苏联对社会主义各国提供援助和经济互助的主要方法是通过平等、互利和密切合作的贸易关系进行的。通过对外贸易这一渠道，苏联向其他社会主义国家输出大量的机器设备、金属、器材、原料、医药以及生活必需品等等。苏联并且同其他社会主义国家实行了科学技术合作，经常相互交流生产建设中的技术经验。苏联还帮助友好国家组织原子能的生产，帮助它们和平利用原子能。所有这些，对于社会主义各国的经济发展，都具有极其重大的意义。同时，当帝国主义侵略集团积极准备向世界和平、民主、社会主义的力量进攻的时候，拥有强大经济力量和军事力量的苏联，又同其他社会主义国家结成了牢不可破的联盟。在反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中，社会主义阵营各国有互相协助的义务，每一个社会主义国家的防御能力，都是以整个社会主义阵营力量为基础的。正因为如此，就使得帝国主义侵略集团的战争计划受到了严重的打击，使社会主义各国的安全都得到了可靠的保障。全世界都可以看到，当去年帝国主义者和匈牙利国内反动势力进行旨在推翻匈牙利人民民主制度和社会主义成就的反革命颠覆活动的时候，当代表人民意志和民族利益的匈牙利工农革命政府要求苏联援助的时候，英勇的苏联人民就像过去帮助匈牙利人民获得解放一样地派出自己的军队来援助匈牙利人民，粉碎了帝国主义者和反革命分子的阴谋。其他社会主义国家，也对匈牙利人民作了极大的支持和援助。正是这种对于无产阶级国际主义的忠诚，保证了强大的社会主义阵营成为世界和平和世界人民革命事业的铜墙铁壁。
    既然共产主义运动的目的是要消灭一切剥削制度，当然也反对任何民族压迫。革命的无产阶级认为，压迫别的民族的民族是不能自由的，各民族平等是无产阶级必须遵循的原则。因此，全世界无产阶级互相支援并且努力援助一切被压迫民族，就成了无产阶级革命运动的基本原则和要求。列宁指出：“社会主义革命将不仅仅是和主要是每一个国家里革命无产者反对本国资产阶级的斗争；不是的，这一革命将是一切受帝国主义压迫的殖民地和国家、一切附属国反对国际帝国主义的斗争。”他一再指出：东方各民族不再是帝国主义发财的对象，而是参与解决全人类命运的斗争的重要的一部分，甚至是决定全世界革命必将胜利的最大保证。早在1916年，列宁就说过：“我们竭力要与蒙古人、波斯人、印度人、埃及人接近和融洽，我们认为实行这一点乃是自己的责任和自己的利益，因为不如此则欧洲的社会主义就将是不巩固的。”十月革命胜利后，列宁更从俄国劳动人民和全世 界劳动人民的根本利益出发，提出了“各民族一律平等”和“支援一切民族的解放斗争”的响亮号召。十月革命四十年来，苏联坚决地和始终不渝地支持着一切殖民地、半殖民地国家人民的解放事业，苏维埃国家从建立最初之日起，就向中国、伊朗、土耳其和其他东方国家伸出了兄弟和友谊之手，废除了帝俄时代所订定的一切不平等条约，取消了沙皇政府的特权，宣布和东方国家在争取民族独立的斗争中结成同盟；而东方各国人民也在不同程度上以不同的速度接受了十月革命的影响，此起彼伏地掀起了民族解放运动的怒潮。特别是在第二次世界大战以后的十二年来，已经有全球人口的一半，即十三亿以上的人口摆脱了殖民地附属国的地位。其中除了中国、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国连同第二次世界大战以前就已获得解放的蒙古人民共和国，选择了社会主义制度的发展道路之外，印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、埃及、叙利亚和其他许多国家也已摆脱了殖民制度，走上民族独立的发展道路。东方国家听受帝国主义殖民势力压迫宰割的时代，已经永远一去不复返了。殖民地、半殖民地国家民族解放运动的巨大发展和所获得的胜利，是同十月革命以及十月革命所产生的苏联分不开的。伟大的苏联对于各国民族解放运动的支持以及对于国际帝国主义反动势力的打击，是一切国家民族解放运动获得胜利的重要因素。为了巩固东方各国的独立地位，苏联对已经获得独立的亚非国家还进行着政治上、经济上和文化上的援助。苏联的这种态度，鲜明地、一贯地表现在它的外交政策方面。苏联坚决支持中国、印度、缅甸等国提出的和平共处“五项原则”，坚决支持亚非各国的万隆会议决议，并且在历次联合国会议和其他的国际会议上，经常不断地支持一切反对殖民主义的民族独立运动，全力支持亚非国家和其他国家反对帝国主义侵略和争取、维护本国独立的斗争。当英法帝国主义者唆使以色列并在美国帝国主义同意下发动侵略埃及的战争时，苏联政府毫不犹豫地宣布采取制止侵略的坚决措施，对于保卫埃及的独立地位、恢复中近东的和平和制止第三次大战起了极其重大的作用。苏联坚决无情地揭露了艾森豪威尔主义对中近东的侵略面目，特别是在最近揭露了美国策划勾结土耳其部署侵略叙利亚的战争，苏联宣布将采取一切必要措施援助叙利亚抗击侵略者。这一切都说明了，苏联一贯是东方弱小民族最真挚的朋友。由于有了强大的苏联的存在并且一贯地鲜明地采取了支持和保卫民族独立运动的政策，这就使得那些刚刚获得独立地位的亚非国家能够保持自己的独立地位。此外，苏联在经济上给予这些国家的支持和援助，对于帮助他们进一步巩固自己的独立地位也有特别重要的作用。苏联的援助是不附带任何政治的军事的条件的，这和帝国主义者奴役性的援助是根本不同的。苏联帮助印度建立一座年产一百多万吨钢铁的冶金工厂，就是这种合作的一个典型表现。这个事实说明，为了获得现代化工业设备和其他必需的商品，东方国家是用不着依靠向帝国主义者乞讨过活了。而且，由于有了苏联和社会主义国家的这种援助，就迫使帝国主义者也不得不在政治上和贸易方面向东方国家作出一些让步。帝国主义者所谓“援助”的奴役性质，已经进一步地暴露在东方各国人民之前；而伟大的苏联在支持东方各国的独立和维护和平的斗争中的伟大作用，也就更加为各国人民认识清楚了。（未完）
