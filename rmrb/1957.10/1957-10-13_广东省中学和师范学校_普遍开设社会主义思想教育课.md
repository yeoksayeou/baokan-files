Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th - "Socialist Ideological Education" courses have now been universally established in middle schools and normal schools throughout Guangdong Province.

Throughout the entire educational process, this course will adopt a method that closely integrates theory and practice. For first and second-year junior middle school students, the focus will be on positive education. In addition to classroom lectures, students will be appropriately organized for discussions, or to visit factories and agricultural cooperatives; for students in the third year of junior middle school and above, the principle of combining positive education with ideological criticism will be implemented. In addition to classroom lectures, discussion time will be increased, and students will be organized to engage in debates on major issues or serious ideological problems that exist among students; for students in the third year of senior middle school, equal emphasis will be placed on lectures, discussions, and debates.

To ensure that this course achieves the desired effect, most middle schools and normal schools throughout the province have selected teachers with excellent character and high political and ideological levels to teach this course, in addition to the principals or heads of teaching affairs departments personally lecturing and directly supervising the instruction.

    广东省中学和师范学校
    普遍开设社会主义思想教育课
    新华社广州11日电　广东省各中学、师范学校目前已经普遍开设“社会主义思想教育”课。
    这一课程在整个教育过程中，都将采取理论和实践紧密结合的方法：对初中一、二年级的学生主要是进行正面教育，除在课堂讲授以外，还适当地组织学生讨论，或到工厂、农业社进行参观和访问；对初三以上各年级学生，则贯彻正面教育和思想批判相结合的原则，除课堂讲授外，还增加讨论时间，对重大问题或学生中存在的严重思想问题，则组织学生展开辩论；对高中三年级的学生，则讲课与讨论、辩论并重。
    为了使这一课程收到预期的效果，目前全省大多数中学、师范学校除了由校长或教导主任亲自授讲并直接负责指导外，还挑选了品质优良、政治思想水平较高的教师，来担任这门课的讲授。
