    King of Wines - "Shan Niang" Hits the Market

    Shaoxing wine is one of the eight famous wines in the country, and the fragrant and uniquely flavored Shan Niang wine is a fine wine among Shaoxing's famous wines. This wine stopped being brewed in 1937 due to looting by Japanese invaders, and production was not resumed until 1956. The 160,000 jin of "Shan Niang" wine brewed last winter by the local state-owned Shaoxing Winery and the joint state-private Shen Yonghe Winery has now been shipped and sold to Hangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing and other places.

    酒中之王——“善酿”上市
    绍兴酒是全国八大名酒之一，而芬芳馥郁独具一色的善酿酒，又是绍兴名酒中的佳酿。这种酒在1937年因受日寇抢掠而停酿，直到1956年才恢复生产。去年冬天地方国营绍兴酒厂和公私合营沈永和酒厂酿的十六万斤“善酿”酒现已运销杭州、上海、北京等地。（附图片）
