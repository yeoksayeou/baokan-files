Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th. More than 260 graduates from universities and colleges such as Tsinghua University, Tianjin University, and Tongji University, who have been assigned to work in Lanzhou, have begun to participate in physical labor before formally starting their jobs. They have all been assigned to worker groups in various construction sites in Lanzhou according to their respective majors, and live and labor together with the workers. They are now serving as steelworkers, concrete workers, electricians, mechanics, carpenters, bricklayers, and mud workers.

Most of these university and college graduates are willing to participate in physical labor, viewing it as a good opportunity to train themselves. Although they felt unfamiliar with the work and somewhat strenuous at the beginning, they quickly got used to it. Huang Weijun, Yang Nanping, Gao Liming, and others, Zhejiang University graduates assigned to a basic construction site, wrote a joint letter to the construction site leaders saying: "We want to experience the glory and greatness of labor through this labor training, establish a labor perspective, eliminate the bad habit of belittling physical labor in the past, understand the lives and thoughts of workers, and are determined to be proletarian intellectuals." Gao Yinlan, a Xi'an Architectural School graduate working as a carpenter at another construction site, was praised by all the workers in her group because of her good work attitude and her willingness to learn from veteran workers, even though she had only been participating in labor for less than a week.

At present, factories and enterprises in Lanzhou that accept university and college graduates to participate in work have decided that university graduates must participate in a certain period of physical labor, in accordance with the "Several Principles Regarding the Allocation of Graduates from Higher Education Institutions in the Summer of 1957" issued by the State Council.

    正式参加工作前先接受劳动锻炼
    兰州一批大学毕业生和工人同生活同劳动
    新华社兰州8日电　被分配到兰州工作的清华大学、天津大学、同济大学等大、专学校本届毕业生二百六十多名，在正式参加工作以前，开始参加体力劳动。他们都按照各人所学的专业被编入兰州各个建设工地的工人小组，和工人一同生活，一同劳动。现在他们分别担任了钢筋工、混凝土工、电气工、机械工、木工、瓦工和泥工。
    这些大、专毕业生大都愿意参加体力劳动，把它看做是锻炼自己的好机会。虽然在开始他们感到工作生疏，有些吃力，但很快就习惯了。被分配在一个基本建设工地的浙江大学毕业生黄伟君、杨南屏、高丽明等联名写信给工地领导说：“我们要通过这次劳动锻炼，体会劳动的光荣、伟大，树立劳动观点，消除以往轻视体力劳动的坏习气，了解工人的生活和思想感情，决心做一个无产阶级的知识分子。”在另一个工地上当木工的西安建筑学校毕业生高引兰，参加劳动不到一个星期，由于她劳动态度很好，虚心向老工人学习，就受到她所在小组的全体工人的表扬。
    目前兰州接受大、专毕业生参加工作的工厂、企业，都根据国务院关于高等学校1957年暑期毕业生分配工作的几项原则规定，决定了大学毕业生都要参加一定时间的体力劳动。（附图片）
