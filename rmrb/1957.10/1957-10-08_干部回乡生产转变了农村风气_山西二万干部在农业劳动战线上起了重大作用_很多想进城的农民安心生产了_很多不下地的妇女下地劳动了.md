Cadre Return to Rural Production Transforms Rural Atmosphere
20,000 Shanxi Cadres Play a Significant Role on the Agricultural Labor Front
Many Farmers Who Wanted to Enter the City Now Focus on Production; Many Women Who Did Not Work in the Fields Now Do So.

    (Our Dispatch) The more than 20,000 cadres in Shanxi Province who have returned to their production posts are playing an active role on the front of building a new countryside.

    The majority of the staff members who have returned to production actively engage in agricultural labor, thus changing some people's views on labor. In Wutai County, 140 cadres completed a total of 1,942 workdays within a month of returning to their hometowns. They also quickly became familiar with the operation and management of the agricultural cooperatives. In Pinglu County, cadre Guo Jianrong completed 61 workdays in the 70 days after returning to Xiyan Township, and also used his spare time to record work points and read newspapers for the villagers. In Xicun, Beiyangcun and other villages in Wutai County, women did not have the habit of working in the fields. Since the female cadres Yang Sancui and Tian Cuixie returned to the villages, they have motivated more than half of the women in the two villages to go to the fields, solving the problem of insufficient labor. Female cadre Han Cuilan, from Tuanxiang Township, upon returning home, mobilized 60 women to cut grass, solving the feed problem for 50 livestock. These comrades not only won the love of the masses, but also reversed the atmosphere of some people being unwilling to engage in agricultural production with their actions. Before March, more than 100 village cadres in Wutai County wanted to leave production, and more than 5,000 farmers wanted to enter the city, often going to the government in groups to apply for going out. Many middle and primary school graduates were also unwilling to return to their hometowns to participate in production. Now, seeing the returning staff actively participating in labor, they have said, "They used to be cadres and are more educated than us, and they are content to work in the countryside, so what reason do we have to be unwilling?" Many people have actively devoted themselves to production.

    Many of the returning staff members have taken up positions in the agricultural cooperatives as cultural and welfare officers, volunteer teachers, study group leaders, newspaper reading group leaders, and propagandists. They have restored some rural clubs, read newspapers to the elderly farmers in the fields, and propagated and explained the Party's policies to the masses, greatly enlivening the political and cultural life in the countryside.

    Among the more than 20,000 cadres who have returned to their production posts throughout the province, more than 5,000 township cadres were originally closely connected with the agricultural cooperatives, and many of them were promoted from the cooperatives. About 80% of them have returned to the cooperatives and have again taken up leadership positions such as cooperative directors and Party branch secretaries. After Gao Bairen returned to Xiyan Township in Pinglu County, he was so active in his work that the two production teams in the cooperative competed to elect him as their captain. After Wang Diantang returned to his hometown in Shengrenjian Township, he promoted many new technologies, which made the sweet potatoes grown by the production team he led exceptionally good. The masses said with satisfaction: "Chairman Mao is so wise to send cadres back to lead production, ensuring a bumper harvest."

    The returning cadres have been loved by the masses in all aspects, which is the result of their active work, contentment with production, and sharing weal and woe with the masses. In order to consolidate this achievement and summarize experiences, Pinglu and other counties recently organized special personnel to go to various places to visit some of the cadres who had returned to production. According to the interviews with 55 people, 43 of them achieved "four satisfactions" (the individual is satisfied, the cadres are satisfied, the masses are satisfied, and the family is satisfied). Through the interviews, the confidence of the returning cadres in building a new socialist countryside has been further strengthened. (Gu Ye)

    干部回乡生产转变了农村风气
    山西二万干部在农业劳动战线上起了重大作用
    很多想进城的农民安心生产了　很多不下地的妇女下地劳动了
    本报讯　山西省回到生产岗位的两万多名干部，正在建设新农村这条战线上起着积极的作用。
    大多数回到生产中去的工作人员，积极从事农业劳动，因而改变了一些人对劳动的看法。五台县一百四十名干部在返乡后的一个月内一共做了一千九百四十二个劳动日。并且很快地熟悉了农业社的经营管理。平陆县干部郭建荣回到西延乡的七十天当中，已做了六十一个劳动日，还利用空隙时间为乡亲们记工读报。五台县西村、北阳村等地的妇女，原来没有下地生产的习惯，自从女干部杨三翠、田翠些回村以后，带动了两村一半以上的妇女都下了地，解决了劳力不足的问题。团城乡女干部韩翠兰回到家里，发动六十名妇女割草，解决了五十头牲畜的饲料。这些同志不仅博得了群众的爱戴，还以行动扭转了有些人不安心农业生产的风气。3月份以前，五台全县有一百多名村干部要求脱离生产，五千多名农民想进城，经常成群结队到政府申请外出，许多中学和小学毕业生也不肯回乡参加生产。现在，他们看见了回乡工作人员积极参加劳动，纷纷说：“人家当过干部，文化又比咱们高，都安心在农村劳动，咱还有啥理由不安心。”许多人已经积极投入了生产。
    回乡工作人员中有许多人担任了农业社里的文化福利股长、义务教员、学习组长、读报组长和宣传员等职务。他们恢复了一些农村俱乐部，并且在地里为老农读报，向群众宣传解释党的政策，农村里的政治文化生活因之大大活跃起来。
    全省回到生产岗位的两万多名干部中，有五千多名乡干部都是原来和农业社联系很密切，并且许多人就是从社里提拔起来的。他们此次回到社里，有80％左右的人又重新担任了社长和党支部书记等领导职务。平陆县西延乡高百忍回去后，由于工作积极，社里的两个生产队争着选他当队长。圣人涧乡王典堂回乡后推广了许多新技术，使他领导的生产队的红薯长得格外好。群众满意地说：“毛主席，真英明，打发干部回来领导生产，实现大丰收就有了保证。”
    回乡干部在各方面都受到了群众的热爱，这是他们积极工作、安心生产、同群众共甘苦的结果。为了巩固这一成就，总结经验，平陆等县不久以前曾组织专人分赴各地，登门访问了一些回乡生产的干部，据访问的五十五人的情况来看，达到四满意（本人满意、干部满意、群众满意、家庭满意）的同志有四十三人。经过访问，已进一步坚定了回乡干部建设社会主义新农村的信心。　　　　（顾页）
