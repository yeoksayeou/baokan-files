Following the publication of the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft), leading organs in Hunan Province are actively revising their counties' agricultural production development plans in the spirit of overcoming right-leaning thought and tapping production potential. Jianghua Yao Autonomous County, based on the specific circumstances of its forestry production, has proposed to green all possible barren land and mountains in the county by 1965. The county has already created experience in winter afforestation, and as long as it is vigorously promoted, it can overcome the current difficulty of insufficient labor during spring afforestation, and accelerate the speed of afforestation. The Xiangxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also plans to basically eliminate drought in 1960, and this winter it will mobilize 4.5 million labor days to launch a winter water conservancy construction upsurge. In Hanshou County, which borders Dongting Lake, the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued a call to farmers throughout the county to strive to achieve the goal of 800 jin of rice per mu in paddy fields and 100 jin of seed cotton per mu in cotton fields by 1963. The county is tapping production potential from four aspects: building water conservancy projects, vigorously accumulating fertilizer, resolving the contradiction of insufficient labor, and strengthening technical guidance, to ensure the realization of the grain and cotton production increase plans.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 29th. Agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province are enthusiastically discussing the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft). After discussing the agricultural development program, cadres and member representatives of the You'ai Agricultural Cooperative in Yueyang County revised various production increase targets in the originally drafted five-year long-term plan, increased the annual output targets for jute and peanuts, expanded the development plan for tung oil trees, ramie, and breeding draft cattle, and supplemented five items: running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, managing households diligently and thriftily, eliminating the four pests, and improving living conditions. After revising the plan, the cooperative immediately decided to accumulate another 5,000 dan of fertilizer this winter and start water conservancy construction half a month earlier. The members of the He'er Cooperative Number Two of the He'er Township of Changsha County are very interested in the provision in the draft program that agricultural cooperatives should store grain. Liu Zhaonan, the director of the cooperative, said: "We didn't store grain in the past. Once we encountered natural disasters, the state had to spend a lot of manpower and financial resources to transport grain from far away to supply us. This year we stored 5,000 jin of grain, and next year we will store another 25,000 jin, and we will store more in the year after that. Even if we encounter a couple of years of disaster, we won't have to worry about food." In the discussion, the members unanimously believed that as long as they work hard according to these forty provisions for ten years, the countryside will be as beautiful as a picture.

    根据全国农业发展纲要精神
    湖南各县挖掘潜力修订规划
    本报长沙29日电　全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布后，湖南省各县领导机关正在本着克服右倾思想，发掘生产潜力的精神，积极修订本县发展农业生产的规划。江华瑶族自治县根据本县林业生产的具体情况，提出要在1965年就绿化全县一切可能绿化的荒地荒山。这个县已创造了冬季造林的经验，只要大力推广，就可克服现在春季造林时劳动力不足的困难，加速造林的速度。中共湘乡县委会也规划在1960年基本消灭旱灾，今年冬季就要动用四百五十万个劳动日，掀起一个冬修水利的热潮。在洞庭湖滨的汉寿县，中共县委会已向全县农民发出号召，要争取在1963年实现稻田亩产八百斤稻谷，棉田亩产一百斤皮棉的目标。这个县正在从兴修水利、大力积肥、解决劳动力不足的矛盾、加强技术指导这四个方面来挖掘生产潜力，保证粮、棉增产计划的实现。
    本报长沙29日电　湖南省各地农业社热烈讨论全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）。岳阳县友爱农业社的干部和社员代表，在讨论了农业发展纲要以后，修改了原来拟定的五年远景规划各项增产指标，提高了黄麻、花生的年产量的指标，扩大了桐油、苎麻、繁殖耕牛的发展计划，补充了勤俭办社、勤俭治家、除四害、改善居住条件等五项内容。经过修订规划后，这个社立即决定在今冬再增积五千担肥料，把兴修水利的工作提前半个月进行。长沙县合心乡合心二社的社员对纲要草案中提出农业社要储备粮食这一条，很感兴趣。社主任柳照南说：“我们过去没有储备粮食，一遇到天灾，就要国家花很多人力财力从远处运粮来供应，今年我们储备了五千斤粮食，明年再储备二万五千斤，后年再多储备些，以后就是遇上个把灾荒年，也不愁吃的。”社员们在讨论中一致认为，只要照这四十条规定下劲搞它十年，农村就会如花似锦。
