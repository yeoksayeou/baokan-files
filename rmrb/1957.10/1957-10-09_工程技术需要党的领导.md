Engineering Technology Needs the Leadership of the Party
Gu Kangle, Deputy Director of the Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute of the Ministry of Urban Construction

Since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, the country's various construction projects have achieved brilliant accomplishments. As an engineer, I feel particularly close to the design work in urban construction that I have personally participated in. Many emerging industrial cities have built water plants, sewage treatment plants, and laid water and sewer pipe networks on a large scale. This achievement is the result of the united efforts of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

The Chinese people need the leadership of the Communist Party and must take the socialist road. This is the historical conclusion drawn by the people of the whole country after a century of heroic struggle. In the short span of eight years, everyone can see the rapid progress China has made in economic, political, scientific, technological, cultural, educational, and ideological construction. Many international friends and foreign guests who have visited China are amazed to see how a poor and backward country has been transformed into such a new and vibrant nation.

We engineering and technical personnel are able to participate in such great socialist construction and contribute our strength. We deeply appreciate the superiority of the socialist system and wholeheartedly support the Communist Party. Today, we enjoy the care of the people and the concern of the Party, and we have broad prospects. We no longer feel that our technology has no place to be used, but only feel that we cannot keep up with the needs of the developing situation. Furthermore, when we compare the living standards provided to us by the state with those of the working people who have shed their blood and sweat, we feel even more ashamed.

The right-wing elements go against their conscience and say that the Party is an amateur in technology, that amateurs cannot lead experts, that Party cadres who do not understand technology cannot hold leadership positions in technical departments, and that non-Party technical cadres have positions but no power, or that some power is fought for... etc. These arguments are obviously absurd.

They turn a blind eye to these enormous construction achievements unanimously praised by people all over the world. They exaggerate shortcomings to the point of overshadowing all achievements, with the aim of overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party in order to realize their conspiracy to take the capitalist road.

What is the leadership of the Party? I believe that first of all, it is to formulate the guidelines and policies for technological development based on the interests of socialism and the needs of economic construction, and to carry out certain organizational leadership to ensure the implementation of these guidelines and policies. So-called leadership is to organize all parties to give full play to their strength to build the socialist cause, not to be proficient in every specific technical detail.

The right-wing elements arrogantly believe that as long as they raise the so-called "position without power" fallacy to scientific and technological workers, they will be able to arouse people's dissatisfaction with the leadership of the Communist Party, and people will follow them to drive the Communist Party off the stage. This underestimates the political consciousness and political discernment of intellectuals!

I work with several responsible Party comrades in the design institute. Major issues are discussed collectively, and daily business is divided and assigned to responsible persons. Most of the leaders of the institute's production units are non-Party members. Everyone believes that they have positions and power, and have never felt any problems with their authority. Why do the right-wing elements close their eyes to the facts?

A state worker has authority if they do their duty and are responsible. The right-wing elements' call for the issue of power is nothing more than an attempt to restore the rule of the bourgeoisie.

Tell the bourgeois right-wing elements that in China today, when the Chinese people have basically achieved the victory of the socialist revolution, it is impossible for you to openly oppose socialism and support the restoration of capitalism.

We engineering and technical personnel firmly believe that the Party can lead science and technology. We are determined to work with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party to defeat the rampant attack of the right-wing elements, strengthen our ideological transformation, cultivate ourselves into socialist red experts, and strive for socialist construction.

    工程技术需要党的领导
    城市建设部给水排水设计院副院长　顾康乐
    第一个五年计划执行以来，国家各项建设都获得了辉煌的成就。我是一个工程师，以我亲身参加的城市建设方面的设计工作来说，感觉更为亲切。很多新兴的工业城市修建自来水厂、污水处理厂和铺设上下水管网，规模很大，这个成就是全国人民在中国共产党领导下团结一致共同奋斗的成果。
    中国人民要共产党的领导，要走社会主义道路，这是全国人民经过百年来英勇奋斗所得出的历史结论。在短短的八年中，我国人民在经济、政治、科学技术、文教、思想等方面建设的突飞猛进大家都看得见，来我国访问的国际友人和一些外国客人，看到一个穷困落后的国家改变成今天这样崭新的面貌，很多人都感到惊异。
    我们工程技术人员能参加这样伟大的社会主义建设，能贡献出自己的力量，我们深深体会到社会主义制度的优越性，我们衷心拥护共产党。今天，我们得到了人民的爱护，党的关怀，有了广阔的前途，不再感到什么技术无用武之地，而只是感到自己跟不上形势发展的需要。另外从国家给我们的生活待遇等方面和流了血汗的劳动人民对比一下，更感到不胜惭愧。
    右派分子违背良心说党对技术是外行，外行不能领导内行，不懂技术的党员干部不能在技术部门担任领导工作，还说非党技术干部是有职无权或是说有些权是争来的……等等，这些论调显然是很荒谬的。
    他们对于这些全世界人民所一致赞叹的巨大建设成绩视而不见，他们把缺点夸大到盖过一切成绩的程度，其目的就是为了推翻共产党的领导，以实现其走资本主义道路的阴谋。
    党的领导是什么呢？我以为首先是要根据社会主义的利益和经济建设的需要规定技术发展的方针政策，并为保证方针政策的实现，进行一定的组织领导。所谓领导就是组织各方面充分发挥力量来建设社会主义事业，并不是要对具体的技术细节样样都通。
    右派分子狂妄地认为只要向科学技术工作者抬出所谓“有职无权”这句谰言，就能够激起人们对于共产党领导的不满，人们就会跟着他们去把共产党轰下台来，这未免把知识分子的政治觉悟和政治鉴别力估计得太低了！
    我在设计院同好几位党员负责同志在一起工作，重大问题集体讨论，日常业务分工负责，院的各生产单位的领导，非党同志居多，大家认为自己有职有权，从来没有感到什么职权问题，右派分子为什么闭眼不看事实呢？
    一个国家工作人员能够尽职尽责就是有职有权。右派分子喊叫职权问题，无非是企图恢复资产阶级的统治而已。
    告诉资产阶级右派分子们，在中国人民基本上取得了社会主义革命胜利的今天，你们要公开地反对社会主义和拥护资本主义复辟是不可能的。
    我们工程技术人员坚信党能够领导科学技术，决心在党的领导下同全国人民一道击溃右派分子的猖狂进攻，加强自己的思想改造，把自己培养成为社会主义的红色专家，为社会主义建设而奋斗。
