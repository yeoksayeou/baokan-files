　　Farmers in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, after undergoing socialist debates, have successively proposed reducing the amount of cotton retained for personal use, keeping the inferior cotton for themselves and selling the better quality cotton to the state to support industrial construction. Some cotton farmers said, "We are an old cotton-producing area, and every household has some old cotton wadding. The problem of cotton for quilts is easy to solve. We should sell as much new cotton as possible to the state to support industrial construction!" Yangjiazhai Agricultural Cooperative in Gaocheng County decided to reduce the amount of cotton retained by each person by one jin, saving a total of 3,306 jin for the entire cooperative. Members of the Chengguan Second Agricultural Cooperative in Gaocheng County decided to retain inferior cotton for their own use and sell the good cotton to the state. The cooperative has now processed more than 1,000 jin of red and stiff cotton and distributed it to the members. Duanjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Jin County also specially found members who knew how to fluff cotton to re-fluff old cotton wadding for everyone, saving new cotton. Members of Xincheng and Dasizhuang townships in Shulu County saved a total of 8,144 jin of good cotton from their self-retained cotton to sell to the state.

　　Now, the cotton farmers in Shijiazhuang Prefecture are launching a competition to "retain less and sell more, retain inferior and sell good." According to calculations by the Shijiazhuang Prefecture Cotton Unified Purchase and Sales Office, there are more than 5,042,000 cotton-planting people in the entire prefecture. If each person saves an average of at least four liang of self-retained cotton, a total of more than 1,260,000 jin of ginned cotton can be saved.

　　National cotton-growing model Qu Yaoli-led Guoguang Agricultural Cooperative had sold more than 120,000 jin of cotton to the state by October 9th. This is a 90% increase over the amount of cotton sold during the same period last year.

　　This year, Guoguang Agricultural Cooperative's more than 10,100 mu of cotton fields, after overcoming natural disasters such as wind, drought, and pests, achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu was 64 jin, exceeding the average yield per mu last year by 41%; it was also 25% higher than the bumper year of 1954. After the great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and after hearing Qu Yaoli recount a situation where he saw a cotton textile factory stop work due to a lack of raw materials, the members of the Guoguang Agricultural Cooperative unanimously stated that the cotton of the Guoguang Cooperative should not only be produced in large quantities, but also be sold in large quantities and sold quickly to support industrial construction. The members also decided to change the amount of cotton retained by each person from the original two and a half jin to one and a half jin, and sell all 4,800 jin of ginned cotton saved by the cooperative to the state.

    石家庄专区农民开展竞赛
    把更多更好的棉花卖给国家
    国光农业社卖棉量比去年增加90％
    本报讯　河北省石家庄专区的棉农们，经过社会主义大辩论以后，纷纷提出降低留棉量，留次卖好，把更多、更好的棉花卖给国家。有的棉农说：“我们这里是老产棉区，谁家也有几斤旧套花，絮棉问题好解决，还是把新棉花尽量卖给国家支援工业建设吧！”藁城县杨家寨农业社决定每人少留一斤棉，全社一共少留三千三百零六斤。藁城城关第二农业社社员决定留用次棉，把好花卖给国家。现在社里已将一千多斤红花、僵瓣加工，分给了社员。晋县段家庄农业社还特地找了会弹棉花的社员，替大家重弹旧套花，节约新棉。束鹿县新城、大寺庄两个乡的社员，在自留棉中共节约了八千一百四十四斤好花卖给国家。
    现在石家庄专区的棉农们正在开展“少留多卖、留次卖好”的竞赛运动。据专区棉花统购统销办公室的计算，全专区共有五百零四十二万多植棉人口，以每人平均最少节约四两自留棉计算，一共可以节约一百二十六万多斤皮棉。

    本报讯　全国著名植棉模范曲耀离领导的国光农业社，截至10月9日，已经卖了十二万多斤棉花给国家。比去年同期卖棉数量增加90％。
    国光农业社今年种植的一万零一百多亩棉田，在战胜了风、旱、病虫等自然灾害以后，获得了空前未有的大丰收。每亩平均产皮棉六十四斤，超过去年每亩平均产量的41％；比丰收的1954年还提高了25％。国光农业社的社员们，经过社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论，又听到曲耀离叙述他曾经看到的一个棉纺织厂停工待料的情况以后，一致表示：国光社的棉花不但产多，而且要卖的多，卖的快，以支援工业建设。社员们还决定把每人留棉由原来的二斤半改为一斤半，全社节约下来的四千八百斤皮棉，全部卖给国家。
