Who is Interfering in Laos' Internal Affairs
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

On September 25th, the political delegations of both the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Forces announced that the negotiating parties had reached an agreement on a draft law guaranteeing the civil rights of the Lao Fighting Forces; both sides also agreed to continue discussing other outstanding issues, and both sides expressed that these issues would be appropriately resolved. This is an encouraging achievement in the recent period of negotiations between the Lao parties. Since February of this year, the negotiations between the Lao parties have been at a standstill, which is not unrelated to the conspiracy and obstruction of U.S. imperialism. After the new cabinet led by Prince Souvanna Phouma was formed in August, the Lao parties continued to strive to quickly implement the agreements already signed by both parties, especially the agreement on the establishment of a coalition government signed on December 28, 1956. Judging from the recent achievements of the negotiations between the two parties and the atmosphere of mutual understanding in the talks, there is reason to believe that new possibilities for realizing national unity and establishing a coalition government are emerging before the Lao people.

However, whenever this legitimate desire of the Lao people may be realized, there are always some people with ulterior motives who attempt to obstruct and undermine it. The Associated Press has admitted that the United States and its allies have been hoping to refuse to accept the Lao Fighting Forces to participate in the future coalition government. The Associated Press also said that this is an "open secret" in Vientiane. Dules and Robertson of the United States often slander China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as interfering in the internal affairs of Laos, in order to cover up its own sinister conspiracy of obstructing the peaceful unification of Laos and turning Laos into a U.S. military base. This is not surprising. To our regret, Foreign Minister of the Royal Lao Government, Phoui Sananikone, recently made similar remarks. According to a report by Agence France-Presse on September 24th from Paris, Sananikone, while passing through Paris, even accused the "Viet Minh" and China of interfering in the internal affairs of Laos, while saying nothing about the United States, which is truly carrying out blatant interference in Laos. He also asserted that "one-tenth of the personnel in the Lao Fighting Forces are originally from the Viet Minh or China." Sananikone's unfounded accusations are not worth refuting. Everyone knows that China has never interfered in the internal affairs of Laos. The claim that there are Chinese in the Lao Fighting Forces is completely unfounded. Since the Geneva Conference, China has always strictly abided by the sacred obligation imposed by the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference on the participating countries not to interfere in the internal affairs of Laos; during the visit of Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, to China last August, China and Laos signed a joint statement guiding the relations between the two countries with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and China has faithfully implemented this joint statement. As for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnam News Agency was also authorized on September 28 to state that Sananikone's words are unfounded and deliberately distort the truth. The Vietnam News Agency also pointed out that "in fact, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam correctly implemented the Geneva Agreement on the cessation of hostilities and has withdrawn all its volunteer forces from the territory of Laos since 1954. Since that time, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always considered the issue of the Lao Forces participating in Lao national life to be an internal affair of Laos." The fact is also true. Prince Phetsarath, Vice-King of Laos, who recently visited the Lao Fighting Forces area in Sam Neua Province, once said, "I don't think Laos is under the influence of China or North Vietnam." Therefore, it is very clear that the claim that China and Vietnam are interfering in the internal affairs of Laos is completely untenable. Today, it is the U.S. imperialists who are actively interfering in the internal affairs of Laos and obstructing the two negotiating parties in Laos from reaching an agreement and realizing peaceful unification.

We sincerely hope that through the unremitting efforts of the negotiating parties and the people of the whole country in Laos, the cause of unity of the Lao people can be fully realized soon. We also believe that under the high vigilance of the Lao people, all the sinister conspiracies of imperialism to interfere in the internal affairs of Laos will be completely defeated.

    是谁在干涉老挝内政
    本报评论员
    9月25日，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方政治代表团公布，谈判双方已经就关于保障寮国战斗部队的公民权的法律草案达成了协议；双方还同意将继续讨论其他悬而未决的问题，双方并且表示这些问题将会获得适当的解决。这是老挝双方谈判在最近期间所得到的一项值得令人鼓舞的成就。自从今年2月以来，老挝双方谈判一直停滞不前，这同美帝国主义的阴谋阻挠不是毫无关系的。在富马亲王领导下的新内阁于8月成立后，老挝双方继续为尽速实现双方已经签订的各项协定，特别是1956年12月28日签订的关于成立联合政府的协议而努力。从最近双方谈判所已经取得的成就和在会谈中互相谅解的气氛来看，有理由认为，在老挝人民面前正展现出实现国家统一和成立联合政府的新的可能性。
    但是，每当老挝人民这一正当愿望可能实现的时候，总有一些别有用心的人企图加以阻挠和破坏。美联社曾经承认美国及其盟国一直在希望拒绝接纳寮国战斗部队参加将来的联合政府，美联社并说，这在万象已经是一个“公开的秘密”了。美国的杜勒斯和罗伯逊之流还时常含血喷人地污蔑中国和越南民主共和国干涉老挝内政，以图掩饰它自己的阻挠老挝和平统一、从而变老挝为美国军事基地的罪恶阴谋。这原是毫不足奇怪的。使我们遗憾的是，最近老挝王国政府外交大臣冯·萨纳尼空竟也发出类似的论调。据法新社9月24日自巴黎报道，萨纳尼空在路过巴黎时竟也指责“越盟”和中国干涉老挝的内政，而对真正在老挝进行露骨干涉的美国却只字不提。他还一口咬定寮国战斗部队中“十分之一的人员是原籍越盟或中国的人员”。萨纳尼空的这种毫无根据的指责原是不值一驳的。谁都知道，中国从来没有干涉过老挝的内政。寮国战斗部队中有中国人的说法是完全没有根据的。日内瓦会议以来，中国一贯严格遵守日内瓦会议最后宣言所加予与会各国不干涉老挝内政的神圣义务；去年8月老挝王国首相富马亲王来华访问期间，中老两国签订了以和平共处五项原则来指导两国关系的联合声明，对这一联合声明，中国是忠实执行的。至于越南民主共和国方面，越南通讯社也已于9月28日受权声明，萨纳尼空的这些话是毫无根据的，是故意歪曲事实真象的。越南通讯社还指出，“事实上，越南民主共和国政府正确地执行了关于停止敌对行动的日内瓦协定，并且自从1954年以后就从老挝领土上撤出了它的全部志愿部队。自从那个时候以来，越南民主共和国政府一直认为寮国部队参加老挝国民生活问题是老挝的内政”。事实也正是如此。不久以前亲自去桑怒省寮国战斗部队地区访问过的老挝副国王佩差拉亲王就曾经表示，“我不认为寮国是处于中国或北越的影响下的”。因此，十分明显，关于中越两国干涉老挝内政的说法是完全站不住脚的。今天积极干涉老挝内政，阻挠老挝谈判双方达成协议、实现和平统一的正是美帝国主义者。
    我们衷心希望通过老挝谈判双方和全国人民的不懈努力，老挝人民的统一事业能很快地获得完全实现。我们也相信在老挝人民的高度警惕下，帝国主义的一切干涉老挝内政的罪恶阴谋终将遭到彻底的失败。
