Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th - Materials published in Soviet newspapers indicate that, compared to all capitalist countries, the Soviet Union leads in the development speed and many development indicators of various sectors of the national economy.

The Soviet Union's total industrial output now ranks second in the world, only after the United States. However, its industrial development speed has always surpassed all capitalist countries. In terms of industrialization, it took all advanced capitalist countries nearly a hundred years to achieve it; while the Soviet Union completed the road of socialist industrialization in less than twenty years after the October Revolution. Even during the most favorable period of capitalist development, the average annual industrial development speed of all capitalist countries never exceeded 10% to 12%. However, from 1917 to 1936, the average annual growth rate of Soviet industrial production reached 15.5%. In the twenty-five years before 1955, its average annual industrial output growth rate (excluding war years) was as high as 18.2%; while during the same period, the United States only had 2.4%, Britain 3.6%, and France 2.1%. In 1956, the total industrial production of Western European capitalist countries increased by only 3.5%, the United States by only 2.5%, while the Soviet Union's total industrial output increased by about 11%.

The same is true in terms of the overall development speed of the past forty years. From 1917 to 1957, the total development speed of Soviet industry was twelve to twenty times faster than that of the United States, Britain, and France.

In terms of the absolute increase in the production of the most important industrial products such as steel, iron, coal, and cement, the Soviet Union has long surpassed all capitalist countries in Western Europe and has begun to catch up with and surpass the United States in recent years, ranking first in the world. At the same time, the Soviet Union is now the country with the most combined machines and new equipment production in industry, the longest power transmission lines, the highest degree of mechanization in the coal mining industry, and the largest scale of hydropower station construction projects. In addition, over the past forty years, the average annual growth rate of labor productivity in Soviet industry has also exceeded that of any capitalist country, one and a half to several times faster than that of the United States, Britain, and France.

The growth rate of Soviet industrial output per capita is also much faster than that of the United States, Britain, and France. Compared with 1913, the Soviet Union's industrial output per capita last year has increased twenty-one times, while the United States has only increased by 1.4 times during the same period, France by only 70%, and Britain by only 60%. During the same period, the Soviet Union's production of consumer goods per capita increased 7.2 times, while the United States only increased by 50%.

The Soviet Union has the world's largest and most mechanized agriculture. No capitalist country can develop and utilize land resources as rationally as the Soviet Union, or allocate agricultural production rationally throughout the country. The socialist agricultural system and technical level enable the development speed of agricultural labor productivity in the Soviet Union to be faster than that of capitalist countries. For example, from 1929 to 1953, Soviet agricultural labor productivity increased by an average of 6% per year; while the United States only increased by a little more than 2% per year from 1930 to 1954.

The Soviet Union is also the country with the largest grain sown area and the most wheat production in the world. As a result of completing the largest land reclamation work in human history, the Soviet Union's total wheat harvest last year increased by 63% compared with 1953; while during the same period, the United States' total wheat harvest decreased by 15%, Canada decreased by 12%, and Britain, France, Italy, and West Germany combined decreased by 13%. In addition, the Soviet Union has also jumped to the first place in the world in terms of the total output of flax and sugar beets, as well as the unit area yield and quality of cotton. Now, it is striving to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of livestock product output per capita in the next few years; four union republics, such as Ukraine and Lithuania, have already surpassed or will surpass the United States in this regard this year.

Based on the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the Soviet Union's gross national income and per capita national income have grown many times faster than those of capitalist countries. This has greatly increased and improved the income and living standards of the Soviet people, and has also made the Soviet people's food consumption increase faster than anywhere else in the world in the past fifteen to eighteen years.

Over the past forty years, the Soviet Union has also made significant progress in developing culture, education, and science, and has been recognized as a world leader in many areas. Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Soviet Union has trained more than 3.5 million specialized talents with higher education, and its speed and scale of training specialized talents ranks first in the world. The Soviet Union is also the country that publishes the most books in the world. According to statistics, more than one-fifth of the books published in the world each year are published by it. The Soviet Union now has the most doctors in the world in terms of population ratio, with an average of seventeen doctors per 10,000 people last year. Due to the implementation of a comprehensive medical and health care system, the average life expectancy of Soviet residents has now doubled compared to before the revolution, and its population mortality rate is lower than that of most countries in the world (including the United States and France).

The Soviet Union is also constantly achieving leading positions in science and technology. It built the world's first atomic power station a few years ago, and it successfully manufactured various jet airliners for the first time, as well as the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker and the largest synchrophasotron. More than a month ago, the Soviet Union successfully launched the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile, and now it has opened a new era for science with its world-shaking first artificial satellite.

    社会主义制度无比优越的明证
    苏联国民经济发展快过所有国家
    四十年来工业发展速度比美英法快十几二十倍
    文教科学事业的发展也走在最前面
    新华社莫斯科7日电　苏联报刊上发表的材料表明，同所有资本主义国家比较起来，苏联在国民经济各部门的发展速度和许多发展指标上都居于领先地位。
    苏联的工业总产量现在仅次于美国而居世界第二位，然而它的工业发展速度却一直超过所有资本主义国家。在工业化方面，所有先进的资本主义国家差不多都花了成百年的时间才能实现；而苏联在十月革命后不到二十年间就走完了社会主义工业化的道路。即使是在资本主义发展最顺利的时期，所有资本主义国家每年平均的工业发展速度都从未超过10％到12％。然而，从1917年到1936年，苏联的工业生产每年平均增长速度就达到15.5％。在1955年以前的二十五年中，它的工业产量平均每年的增长速度（战争年代除外）高达18.2％；而同时期美国只有2.4％，英国是3.6％，法国是2.1％。在1956年，西欧各资本主义国家的工业生产总共只增加了3.5％，美国只增加了2.5％，而苏联的工业总产量就约增加了11％。
    从过去四十年来总的发展速度来看也是这样。从1917年到1957年，苏联工业的总发展速度就比美、英、法三国快十二倍到二十倍以上。
    按钢、铁、煤、水泥这样一些最重要的工业品的绝对增产量来说，苏联早就超过了西欧所有资本主义国家，并且在最近几年开始赶上和超过美国，而居于世界第一位。同时，苏联现在还是世界上联合机和工业中新装备生产最多、输电线最长、煤矿工业机械化程度最高、水电站建设工程规模最大的国家。此外，在过去四十年中，苏联工业中的劳动生产率每年平均增长速度也超过任何资本主义国家，比美、英、法等国要快一倍半到几倍。
    苏联按人口平均计算的工业产量的增长速度也比美、英、法等国快得多。和1913年比较，去年苏联按人口平均计算的工业产量已经增加为二十一倍，而美国，在同时期只增加了一点四倍，法国只增加了70％，英国只增加了60％。同一时期，苏联按人口平均计算的消费品的生产增加了七点二倍，而美国只增加了50％。
    苏联拥有世界上规模最大、机械化程度最高的农业。没有任何一个资本主义国家能够像苏联那样合理地开发和利用土地资源，那样合理地在全国配置农业生产。社会主义农业制度和技术水平，使得苏联农业劳动生产率的发展速度快于资本主义国家。例如，从1929年到1953年，苏联农业劳动生产率每年平均提高6％；而美国在1930年到1954年每年平均只提高2％多一点。
    苏联还是世界上谷物播种面积最大、小麦生产最多的国家。由于完成了人类历史上规模最大的一次开垦荒地的工作，去年苏联的小麦总收获量比1953年增加了63％；而在同一时期，美国的小麦总收获量却减少了15％，加拿大减少了12％，英国、法国、意大利和西德加起来一共减少了13％。此外，在亚麻和甜菜的总产量以及棉花的单位面积产量和质量方面，苏联也已经跃居世界第一位。现在，它正在努力争取在最近几年在按人口平均计算的畜产品产量上赶上和超过美国；乌克兰、立陶宛等四个加盟共和国现在在这方面就已经超过或者在今年内就将超过美国。
    在工农业生产迅速发展的基础上，苏联的国民总收入和按人口平均计算的国民收入的增长速度都比资本主义国家快好多倍。这使得苏联人民的收入和生活水平有了很大增加和改善，同时也使得苏联人民食物消费量的增加速度在以往十五年到十八年内居于世界第一位。
    四十年来苏联在发展文教和科学事业方面也取得了长足的进展，并且在许多方面被公认居世界领先地位。在苏维埃政权建立以来，苏联已经培养了三百五十多万名受过高等教育的专门人材，它培养专门人才的速度和规模居世界第一位。苏联也是世界上出版书籍最多的国家，据统计，全世界每年出版的书籍中有五分之一以上是它出版的。苏联现在的医生数目，按人口比例来说是世界最多的，去年平均每一万人中就有十七名医生。由于实行了完善的医疗保健制度，苏联居民的平均寿命现在已经比革命前整整延长一倍，它的人口死亡率比世界绝大多数国家（包括美国和法国在内）都低。
    苏联在科学技术方面也不断取得领先地位。它在几年前建成了世界上第一个原子能发电站，它成功地首次制造了各种喷气式客机以及世界上第一艘原子破冰船和最大的同步稳相加速器。一个多月前，苏联在世界上最先成功地发射了洲际弹道火箭，而现在它又用自己的轰动世界的第一颗人造卫星为科学开辟了新纪元。
