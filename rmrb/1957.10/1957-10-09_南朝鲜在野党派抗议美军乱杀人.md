Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang dispatch: South Korea's Hapdong News Agency reported that Chang Taek-sang, chairman of the "Committee for the Defense of National Sovereignty," an organization of South Korean National Assembly opposition party members, and former Prime Minister of the Rhee Syngman government, lodged a serious protest on the 7th with General Decker, commander of the US Eighth Army occupying South Korea, regarding the continuous killings committed by the US military in South Korea.

Cho Byung-ok, Supreme Committee Member of the South Korean Democratic Party, also issued a statement on October 6, saying that the US Eighth Army should take special measures to ensure that such incidents do not occur again.

According to the Dongyang News Agency, the National Federation of Cultural Organizations of South Korea also passed a proposal at its sixth central committee meeting on October 5, demanding that Decker take measures to stop US troops from shooting Koreans.

Seoul newspapers revealed on the 7th that since the cessation of the Korean War in July 1953, 158 incidents of US soldiers shooting people have occurred in South Korea, 70 of which resulted in death. This year alone, there have been 31 incidents of US military shootings, resulting in 13 deaths and 51 injuries. In the past week, US soldiers have killed five South Koreans and injured three others.

The "Dong-A Ilbo" said that the South Korean people's anger at the atrocities of the US military has reached the point of explosion. The "Chosun Ilbo" believes that the US military's arbitrary shooting of South Koreans seems to be a case of trampling on human life due to differences in skin color.

    南朝鲜在野党派抗议美军乱杀人
    据新华社平壤电　南朝鲜的合同通讯社报道，南朝鲜国会在野党议员组织“国民主权拥护斗争委员会”委员长、李承晚政府前国务总理张泽相7日就美军不断在南朝鲜干出杀人罪行的这一情况向侵占南朝鲜的美国第八军军长德克尔提出严重抗议。
    南朝鲜民主党最高委员赵炳玉也在10月6日发表声明说，美国第八军，应该采取特别措施，保证此类事件不再发生。
    据东洋通讯社报道，南朝鲜的全国文化团体总联合会在10月5日举行的第六次中央委员会会议也通过提案，要求德克尔采取措施，制止美军枪杀朝鲜人。
    汉城的报纸7日揭露，自从1953年7月朝鲜战争停止以来，在南朝鲜已经发生了一百五十八件侵朝美国军人开枪打人的事件，其中七十件造成死亡，今年以来发生的三十一件美军开枪事件中，有十三人死亡，五十一人受伤。在过去一个星期中，美国军人共打死五个南朝鲜人，另外还打伤了三人。
    “东亚日报”说，南朝鲜人民对美军暴行的愤慨情绪已到达了爆炸点。“朝鲜日报”认为，美军任意枪杀南朝鲜人的行为似乎是由于肤色差异而到了践踏人类生命的地步。
