Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 20th: The state-owned Friendship Farm, established with the full equipment donated by the Soviet government and people and with the assistance of a large number of experts sent by the Soviet Union, has begun to bear fruit. From May of last year to the present, the farm has transferred more than two hundred technical and management cadres and fifty agricultural technicians to various locations. Including the Friendship Farm's existing dozens of technical and management cadres and five to six hundred skilled workers, all have grown under the direct assistance and guidance of Soviet experts in the past two years. In their daily work, Soviet experts constantly imparted their knowledge of how to lead and manage agricultural production to the farm directors, team leaders, mechanical engineers, or agronomists working with them.

Since the reclamation of wasteland in 1955, one or two thousand people have come to the farm to visit and study each year. Many of the important experiences taught by Soviet experts at the Friendship Farm have been widely promoted in all state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province.

    友谊农场开花结果
    据新华社哈尔滨20日电  由苏联政府和人民赠送全部机器设备并且派遣了大批专家帮助我国建立的国营友谊农场，已经开花结果。从去年5月到现在，农场已经向各地输送出二百多名技术、管理干部和五十名农业技术工人。包括友谊农场现有的几十名技术、管理干部和五、六百名技术工人，都是在苏联专家近两年来的直接帮助和指导下成长起来的。在日常工作中，苏联专家随时将怎样领导管理农业生产的知识，传授给和他一起工作的场长、队长、机务工程师或农学家。
    从1955年开荒以来，每年总有一两千人来到农场参观和学习，苏联专家在友谊农场传授的重要经验，有不少已在黑龙江省所有的国营农场普遍推广。
