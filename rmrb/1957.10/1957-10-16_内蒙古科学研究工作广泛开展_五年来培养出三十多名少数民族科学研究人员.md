Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: In the past five years, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has successively established five scientific research institutions for animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, agriculture, forestry, brucellosis, and traditional Chinese and Mongolian medicine. More than 200 people of various ethnic groups have participated in scientific research work. More than 30 scientific researchers and workers have been trained for the Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, Korean, Daur, and other minority ethnic groups. At present, these scientific research institutions are conducting more than 120 special research projects, of which more than 30 special research projects have achieved preliminary results.

In animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, preliminary research has been carried out on treatment methods for bovine theileriosis and sheep enterotoxemia and camel trypanosomiasis, which have been prevalent for more than 100 years. In terms of forestry science, more than 200 species of trees growing in virgin forests and large deserts have now been surveyed. Based on the characteristics of drought and sandstorms in Inner Mongolia, more than 80 species of pine, spruce, larch, and other tree species suitable for growth have been cultivated through research and experimentation. Due to the development of various scientific research undertakings, a strong impetus has been given to agricultural and pastoral production.

　　内蒙古科学研究工作广泛开展
    五年来培养出三十多名少数民族科学研究人员
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区五年来先后建立了畜牧兽医、农、林业、布氏杆菌病和中蒙医等五个科学研究机构。参加科学研究工作的各族人员有二百多人。为蒙古、回、满、朝鲜、达呼尔等少数民族培养出三十多名科学研究人员和工人。目前，这些科学研究机关进行的各项专题研究达一百二十多个，其中有三十多个专题研究已经取得了初步成果。
    在畜牧兽医上，对流行了一百多年的牛泰氏焦虫病和羊肠毒血症、骆驼锥虫病，已初步研究出治疗的方法。在林业科学方面，现在已调查出生长在原始森林和大沙漠上的二百多种树种。并根据内蒙古地区干旱和风沙大的特点，经研究试验培育出适宜生长的油松、云杉、落叶松等树种八十多种。由于各项科学研究事业的发展，对农牧业生产起了有力的推动作用。
