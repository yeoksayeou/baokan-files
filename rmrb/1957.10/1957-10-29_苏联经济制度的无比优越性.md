    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution created a new era for the life of all mankind. For forty years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have engaged in diligent and selfless labor, and have achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements in socialist economic construction and cultural construction. The Soviet Union has not only completely overcome the extremely backward state before the revolution, but has also become one of the most powerful industrial countries in the world.

    **The Incomparable Superiority of the Socialist Economic System**

    The rapid development of all sectors of the Soviet national economy has completely changed its original position in the world economy. In terms of total industrial output, the Soviet Union has firmly occupied the first place in Europe and has advanced to second place in the world, second only to the United States. At present, the proportion of total Soviet industrial output in the total world industrial production has risen from 1.7% in 1917 to 20%.

    The great achievements of Soviet socialist economic construction and cultural construction have fully demonstrated the incomparable superiority of the socialist economic system and its enormous vitality. The most essential source of this superiority lies, of course, in the socialist economic system. By eradicating the private ownership of the means of production and establishing the socialist ownership of the means of production, the Soviet Union was able to completely break away from the fundamental contradictions and periodic crises of capitalist production, so that the basic laws of the socialist economy and the laws of planned (proportional) development were given full and broad scope for activity. The high development of social productive forces is the inevitable trend after the victory of the socialist revolution.

    **The High-Speed Growth of the Soviet National Economy**

    The high-speed, uninterrupted, and comprehensive growth of the Soviet national economy is one of the most fundamental manifestations of this socialist economic superiority. As everyone knows, pre-revolutionary Russia was backward in terms of production and technology, and the Soviet national economy suffered very serious losses in many domestic and foreign wars; but despite this, the Soviet Union was still able to achieve the task of socialist industrialization in an extremely short period of historical time, and rapidly raise its industrial production to the most advanced level.

    As everyone knows, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union in 1957 will increase forty-five times compared to 1917, that is, more than thirty-two times the level of 1913. This enormous rate of development is unprecedented in history. In terms of the average annual growth rate, even including the war period, the annual growth rate from 1930 to 1955 reached 12.3%; if the war period is not included, the average rate from 1930 to 1940 and 1947 to 1955 should be 18.0%. Isn't this the best proof of the high-speed development of the Soviet national economy, especially industrial production?

    No matter how much the level of production of capitalist countries has exceeded the Soviet Union in the past, because capitalist production is in a state of anarchy and is affected by periodic crises, the speed and stability of production growth can never be compared with the Soviet Union. As everyone knows, from 1913 to 1957, the industrial production of the United States increased only three times, while that of Britain and France increased less than once. Moreover, this growth is unstable and is combined with fluctuations in periodic crises.

    This high-speed development of the Soviet national economy will enable the Soviet Union to achieve its glorious task in the shortest possible historical period, that is, to catch up with and surpass the most advanced capitalist countries in the world in terms of per capita output.

    Compared with several major capitalist countries, in 1913, the total industrial output of the United States reached 14.5 times that of Russia, 4.5 times that of Britain, and 5.9 times that of Germany; calculated on a per capita basis, the United States was 21.4 times that of Russia, Britain was 14 times, and Germany was 13 times.

    But by 1955, the situation had changed greatly. Although the total industrial output of the Soviet Union was still lower than that of the United States, the United States was only 2.1 times that of the Soviet Union; on a per capita basis, the United States was only 2.5 times that of the Soviet Union. Of course, in terms of total output, the Soviet Union had already surpassed Britain, France, and Germany at this time.

    At present, the Soviet Union is victoriously implementing the directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. In terms of major products, this year's timber production has exceeded that of the United States and jumped to the first place in the world, and it is estimated that the country's coal production has also caught up with the United States and will soon occupy the first place in the world. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, the Soviet Union's industrial production will definitely make a great step forward in further approaching and rapidly catching up with the United States.

    The high-speed growth of the Soviet national economy will undoubtedly guarantee the final victory in the peaceful competition with the world's capitalist countries.

        **Planned Development of the National Economy**

    Another important manifestation of the superiority of the Soviet socialist economy is the implementation of the planning of the national economy on the basis of public ownership of the means of production.

    Everyone is very familiar with the fact that the Soviet people have victoriously completed five five-year plans for the development of the national economy, and the directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan are being successfully implemented. In order to be able to make fuller use of the country's rich resources and production potential, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union recently decided to start formulating a long-term plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965.

    For decades, the Soviet Union has consistently implemented the correct policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. This is the fundamental premise for ensuring the smooth realization of expanded social reproduction. Light industry, agriculture, and other sectors of the national economy have also achieved corresponding and enormous development during this period.

    In terms of the growth of industrial production, at present, the production of the means of production has exceeded 73 times that of 1913; and the production of consumer goods has also increased 12 times. It should be particularly pointed out that the industrial production sectors that were particularly backward in the past have been established and strengthened through long-term, large-scale construction. In 1956, the Soviet Union's steel production reached 48.6 million tons, and it will reach more than 51 million tons in 1957; in the 26 years before 1956, the average annual increase was 9%, while the average increase in the United States during the same period was only 2.4%. Electricity production will reach 210 billion kilowatt-hours in 1957, which is 105 times that of 1913, and the growth rate averages 11%-12% per year, which is also much higher than that of the United States. The output of the chemical industry has increased to 115 times that of 1913. The development speed of the machine manufacturing industry and the metal processing industry is even more amazing. It is estimated that the total output this year will increase to 200 times that of 1913. Now, the Soviet Union's important industrial sectors not only have the most advanced technical equipment in the world, but also have created many brand-new production technologies.

    In terms of light industry, cotton and woolen textiles have increased by one to one and a half times compared to 1913, while food industry products have increased by more than ten to thirty times.

    The Soviet Union has also achieved brilliant achievements in agricultural production. At present, the total output of agriculture (excluding animal husbandry) has increased to 2.7 times that of 1913. The output of several important products such as wheat, flax, and beet has reached the first place in the world. Soviet agriculture has now become the largest and most modern agriculture in the world with a large amount of the latest technical equipment.

    In order to ensure the planned development of expanded reproduction in all sectors of the national economy, from 1928 to the present, the state has invested approximately 1.8 trillion rubles (calculated at the prices of July 1, 1955) in the construction of various sectors. During this period, the Soviet Union built and restored an average of approximately three large industrial enterprises and approximately ten kilometers of railway trunk lines and branch lines every day. By 1956, the scale of investment in basic construction had reached 180 billion rubles per year.

    The planned and proportional development of the national economy is one of the most fundamental characteristics of the Soviet socialist economy and is completely unimaginable in any capitalist country.

      **Rapid Increase in Labor Productivity**

      Lenin repeatedly emphasized: "Capitalism can be completely defeated, and it will definitely be completely defeated, because socialism can create new and much higher labor productivity."

    The rapid increase in labor productivity in all sectors of the Soviet Union is another important manifestation of the superiority of the Soviet socialist economy.

    Statistics show that in 1955, the labor productivity of the Soviet industrial production sector had increased seven times compared to 1913. Compared with 1928, it has increased 6.3 times, and compared with 1950, it has increased by 54%.

    The speed of the increase in Soviet labor productivity is beyond the reach of any capitalist country. From 1928 to 1955, the average annual growth rate of labor productivity in the Soviet Union reached 7.35%, while in the United States it only reached 1.4% during the same period. In 1913, Russia's labor productivity was 88.9% lower than that of the United States at that time and 79.6% lower than that of Britain. As a result of the increase in the past forty years, in 1955, the level of labor productivity in the Soviet Union had exceeded Britain by 15%-20% and France by 40%-45%. At present, although it is still behind the United States, it is entirely possible to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of labor productivity after the level of industrial production catches up with and surpasses the United States in the future.

    In the agricultural sector, the development speed of labor productivity in the Soviet Union is also faster than that of capitalist countries. For example, from 1929 to 1953, the labor productivity of Soviet agriculture increased by an average of 6% per year, while in the United States it only increased by an average of a little more than 2% per year from 1930 to 1954.

    **The Growing Material and Cultural Life of the People**

    One of the most fundamental differences between the socialist economy and the capitalist economy is that the former has fundamentally eliminated the phenomenon of human exploitation, and the fundamental purpose of social production is to increasingly meet the growing needs of all members of society in terms of material and cultural life. The significant improvement in the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people over the past few decades is in stark contrast to the lives of the broad masses of people in capitalist countries. According to data, the real wages of Soviet workers and staff in 1956 had increased to 4.8 times that of 1913, and the income of laboring peasants had increased to 5.4 times.

    The Soviet national income, which reflects the vigorous development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural welfare, increased seventeen times in 1956 compared to 1913, and twelve times on a per capita basis.

    It must be pointed out that unemployment has been completely eliminated in socialist Soviet Union.

    The development of Soviet cultural life and scientific research undertakings also far surpasses that of capitalist countries. At present, the publication of Soviet books and the number of doctors per capita have ranked first in the world. In the past forty years, the Soviet Union has trained a total of more than 3.8 million specialized talents with higher education, one million of whom are engineers. The Soviet Union's scientific research undertakings have made the most outstanding and remarkable achievements in recent years. At present, scientists are climbing the highest peak of science in accordance with Lenin's ideals.

    The achievements of Soviet socialist construction over the past forty years are brilliant. It has fully demonstrated the incomparable superiority and abundant vitality of the socialist economic system. Our task is, in addition to having a correct understanding of this great achievement, we should also earnestly and modestly learn from the successful experience of Soviet construction.

    苏联经济制度的无比优越性龙成志
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，为全人类的生活创造了一个新纪元。四十年来，苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，进行了辛勤忘我的劳动，到目前，业已在社会主义的经济建设和文化建设方面，获得了史无前例的光辉成就。苏联不仅已经完全克服了革命以前的极端落后的状态，而且已经成为世界上最强大的工业国之一了。
    社会主义经济制度的无比优越
    苏联国民经济各部门飞跃发展的结果，完全改变了它在全世界经济中所占的原有地位。在工业总产量方面，苏联已经稳占欧洲的第一位、并推进到仅次于美国而居世界的第二位。目前苏联工业总产量在全世界工业总生产中所占的比重，已由1917年的1.7％上升到20％。
    苏联社会主义经济建设和文化建设的伟大成就，已经充分表现了社会主义经济制度的无比优越性和它的巨大的生命力。这种优越性的最本质的根源，当然就在于社会主义的经济制度。由于铲除了生产资料的私人所有制，建立了生产资料的社会主义所有制，从而苏联就能够完全摆脱资本主义生产的根本矛盾和周期性危机，使社会主义经济的基本规律以及有计划（按比例）发展的规律等，获得了充分广阔的活动场所。社会生产力的高度发展，正是社会主义革命胜利后的必然趋势。
    苏联国民经济的高速度增长
    苏联国民经济高速度的、不间断的、全面的增长，即是这种社会主义经济优越性的最根本的表现之一。大家知道，革命前的俄国在生产水平和技术水平方面是落后的，苏联的国民经济在多次国内外战争中还遭受过非常严重的损失；但尽管如此，苏联仍旧能够在极短的历史时期内实现了社会主义工业化的任务，并把自己的工业生产迅速提高到最先进的水平。
    大家知道，1957年苏联工业的总产量，将比1917年增加四十五倍，即超过了1913年水平的三十二倍。这种巨大的发展速度，在历史上是空前未有的。按年平均的增长速度来说，即如包括战争的时期在内，1930年至1955年的年增长率达到12.3％；如不包括战争时期，则1930年至1940年和1947年至1955年的平均速度应为18.0％。这难道不是苏联国民经济、首先是工业生产高速度的、发展的最好证明吗？
    资本主义国家不论在过去其生产的水平已怎样超过了苏联，但由于资本主义生产是无政府状态并且受着周期性危机的影响，生产增长的速度及其稳定性就永远不可能和苏联相比拟。大家知道，自1913年到1957年间，美国的工业生产仅仅增加了三倍，英国和法国则增长不到一倍。而且这种增长是不稳定的，是和周期性危机的波动结合在一起的。
    苏联这种国民经济高速度的发展，就可以使苏联在最短的历史时期内实现自己的光荣任务，即按人口平均计算的生产量赶上并超过世界上最先进的资本主义国家。
    和几个主要资本主义国家相比，在1913年时，美国的工业总产量曾达到俄国的十四点五倍，英国达到四点五倍，德国达到五点九倍；如按人口平均计算，则美国为俄国的二十一点四，英国为十四倍，德国为十三倍。
    但到1955年时，情况已有很大的转变。苏联的工业总产量虽尚低于美国，而美国仅及苏联二点一倍了；按人口平均，美国也仅为苏联的二点五倍。当然，在总产量方面，这时苏联已经超过了英国、法国和德国。
    目前，苏联正在胜利地执行着发展国民经济的第六个五年计划的指示。在主要产品方面，今年的木材采伐量已经超过美国而跃居世界第一位，全国煤产量据估计也已赶上美国而在不久以后也就可以占世界首位了。在第六个五年计划期间，苏联的工业生产将肯定地在进一步接近和迅速赶上美国方面大大地前进一步。
    苏联国民经济高速度的增长，无可怀疑地将保证在和世界资本主义国家进行和平竞赛中获得最后的胜利。
        国民经济的有计划发展
    苏联社会主义经济优越性的另一个重要表现，为在生产资料公有制的基础上实施国民经济的计划化。
    大家十分熟悉，苏联人民已经胜利地完成了五个发展国民经济的五年计划，第六个五年计划的指示正在顺利地执行中。为了能更加充分地利用国家丰富的资源和生产潜力，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议最近又决定即着手制定1959—1965年发展国民经济的长期计划。
    几十年来，苏联一贯执行着优先发展重工业的正确方针。这是保证社会扩大再生产能够顺利实现的根本前提。轻工业和农业以及其他国民经济各部门，在此期间，也获得了相应的巨大的发展。
    就工业生产的增长来说，目前，生产资料的生产已超过了1913年的七十三倍；而消费资料的生产，也增加了十二倍。特别应该指出的是过去特别落后的工业生产部门，经过长期的巨大规模的建设，都已经建立并壮大起来了。1956年苏联的钢产量已达到四千八百六十万吨，1957年将达到五千一百万吨以上；在1956年以前的二十六年间，每年平均增长9％，而同一时期美国平均只增长2.4％。电力生产1957年将达到二千一百亿度，为1913年的一百零五倍，增长速度年平均达到11％—12％，也大大地超过了美国。化学工业的产量，则已经增加到1913年的一百一十五倍。机器制造工业和金属加工工业的发展速度，则是更加惊人的，今年的总产量预计将增加到1913年的二百倍。现在，苏联的各重要工业部门，不仅已拥有世界上最先进的技术装备，而且创造了许多崭新的生产技术。
    在轻工业方面，棉毛纺织品已较1913年增长了一倍至一倍半，食品工业产品则增加了十多倍至三十多倍。
    苏联在农业生产方面，也获得了辉煌的成就。目前农业的总产量（不包括畜牧），已增加为1913年的二点七倍。若干重要产品的产量如小麦、亚麻、甜菜等，达到了世界第一位。苏联农业现在已经成为世界上规模最大并拥有大量最新的技术装备的现代化农业。
    为了保证国民经济各部门扩大再生产的有计划发展，从1928年直到现在，国家已经对各个部门的建设投入了约一万八千亿卢布（按1955年7月1日价格计算）的资金。在此期间，苏联平均每天新建和恢复了约三个大型工业企业，约十公里铁路干线和支线。到1956年，基本建设的投资规模已经达到每年一千八百亿卢布。
    国民经济有计划、按比例的发展，是苏联社会主义经济的最根本特征之一，是任何资本主义国家所完全不可能想像的。
      劳动生产率迅速提高
      列宁一再强调地指出：“资本主义可以被彻底战胜，而且一定会被彻底战胜，因为社会主义能造成新的高得多的劳动生产率。”
    苏联各个部门劳动生产率的迅速提高，是苏联社会主义经济优越性的再一个重要表现。
    统计资料表明，1955年苏联工业生产部门的劳动生产率已较1913年增加了七倍。以1956年和1928年相比，已增加了六点三倍，对1950年则已提高了54％。
    苏联劳动生产率提高的速度是任何资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。自1928年至1955年，苏联劳动生产率的年平均增长速度达到7.35％，而同一时期内美国仅达1.4％。在1913年时，俄国的劳动生产率要比当时的美国低88.9％，比英国低79.6％。由于四十多年来提高的结果，1955年苏联的劳动生产率水平已超过了英国15％—20％，超过了法国40％—45％。目前，虽然还比美国落后，但完全有可能在今后工业生产水平赶上并超过美国以后再在劳动生产率方面赶上并超过美国。
    在农业部门中，苏联劳动生产率的发展速度，也同样快于资本主义国家。例如，从1929年到1953年，苏联农业的劳动生产率每年平均提高达6％，而美国在1930年到1954年每年平均只提高2％多一点。
    人民物质和文化生活日益增长
    社会主义经济和资本主义经济的最根本区别之一，即是前者已经根本上消灭了人剥削人的现象，社会生产的根本目的是越来越大地满足社会全体成员在物质和文化生活方面日益增长的需要。几十年来苏联人民物质和文化生活水平的显著提高，与资本主义国家广大人民的生活成为一个强烈的对比。根据资料，苏联职工的实际工资1956年已提高到1913年的四点八倍，劳动农民的收入则增加为五点四倍。
    反映着国民经济的蓬勃发展和人民物质文化福利不断增进的苏联国民收入，1956年已较1913年增加了十七倍，按人口平均计算也增加了十二倍。
    必须指出，在社会主义的苏联已经完全消灭了失业现象。
    苏联文化生活和科学研究事业的发展，也远胜过了资本主义国家。目前，苏联书籍的出版和按人口平均计算的医生数，都已占了世界第一位。四十年来，苏联已总共培养了三百八十多万受过高等教育的专门人才，其中有一百万是工程师。苏联的科学研究事业近年来已有最杰出最卓越的成就，目前，科学家们正根据列宁的理想攀登上科学的最高峰。
    四十年来苏联社会主义建设的成就是光辉灿烂的。它已经充分证明了社会主义经济制度的无比优越性和充沛的生命力。我们的任务是，除对这种伟大的成就应有正确的认识外，并应该认真地虚心地学习苏联建设的成功经验。
