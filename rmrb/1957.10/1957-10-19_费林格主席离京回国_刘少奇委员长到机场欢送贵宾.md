In his farewell speech to the guests, he said: The visit of the Czechoslovak National Assembly delegation and the Prague Municipal Central People's Committee delegation to our country has not only enhanced mutual understanding and friendship between the people of our two countries, but also contributed to strengthening the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and upholding the noble cause of world peace.

In the eight years since liberation, the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have accomplished miracles in construction, overcome the difficulties left over by colonialism, and are advancing with magnificent strides. We will convey all this to the working people of Czechoslovakia, and this is the power to further enhance the deep friendship between the Czechoslovak people and the Chinese people. Chairman Fierlinger finally wished that the friendly cooperation and deep friendship between the Chinese and Czech people would be further strengthened, and that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union would become even stronger and more consolidated.
