    Revolutionary Cultural Relics Exhibited in Fujian
    The Fujian Province Revolutionary Cultural Relics Exhibition, which closed on October 27th, received over 154,000 visitors in one month and two days.

    The exhibition, following the development process of the Chinese revolution, displayed 2,400 precious revolutionary cultural relics, photographs, models, charts, and so on. The various revolutionary cultural relics and photographs from the period when Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu led the Fourth Red Army into Fujian during the Second Revolutionary Civil War were the most attractive to the audience. Cultural relics and pictures related to the heroic struggles of the Red Army guerrillas who remained in Fujian to persist in guerrilla warfare after the Long March, as well as previous peasant uprisings in Fujian, provided the audience with a profound class education.

    During the exhibition, the exhibition hall was crowded with people. Many farmers and students from Minhou, Changle, Yongtai and other counties brought dry rations and travelled sixty or seventy li in the middle of the night to visit. Some viewers watched repeatedly two or three times. Some young students and Young Pioneers also visited the families of martyrs after seeing the exhibition.

    After its closure in Fuzhou, the exhibition will also tour Fu'an, Nanping, Xiamen, Jinjiang, Zhangzhou, Longyan, and other places. (Xinhua News Agency)

    福建展出革命文物
    10月27日闭幕的福建省革命文物展览会，在一个月零两天中接待了一十五万四千多观众。
    展览会依照中国革命发展进程，陈列了二千四百多件珍贵的革命文物、照片、模型和图表等。在第二次国内革命战争时期，毛主席和朱总司令率领红四军进入福建后的各种革命文物和照片，最吸引观众。有关历次福建农民暴动，以及红军长征后留在福建的红军游击队坚持游击战争的英勇斗争的文物图片，给观众们一次深刻的阶级教育。
    展出过程中，展览馆内挤满人群。闽侯、长乐、永泰等县的许多农民、学生带着干粮，半夜动身走了六七十里路，赶来参观。有些观众反复看两三次。有的青年学生和少先队员，看后还访问了烈士家属。
    展览会在福州闭幕后，还将在福安、南平、厦门、晋江、漳州、龙岩等地巡回展出。（新华社讯）
