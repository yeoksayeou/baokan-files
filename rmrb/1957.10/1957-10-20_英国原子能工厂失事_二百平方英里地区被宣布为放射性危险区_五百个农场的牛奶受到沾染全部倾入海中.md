　　British Atomic Energy Plant Accident
    Two Hundred Square Miles Declared Radioactive Danger Zone
    Milk from Five Hundred Farms Contaminated and Entirely Dumped into the Sea
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from London: A serious accident recently occurred at an atomic energy plant in Windscale, England, causing a large amount of radioactive material to be released, triggering great panic among British authorities. On the evening of the 15th, five hundred workers from the plant held a rally in front of the factory, demanding that authorities re-inspect all equipment. Construction workers at the Calder Hall atomic power station also held a protest mass meeting on the 16th.
    This plutonium-producing atomic energy plant has two atomic reactors, one of which suddenly overheated on the 10th. The atomic reactor itself suffered enormous damage and can no longer be used. At the same time, a large amount of radioactive iodine was released from the reactor's large chimney.
    In recent days, the situation has continued to expand. An area of two hundred square miles around the accident site has been declared a radioactive danger zone. The radioactive material in the air around the plant is increasing. Measurements taken in downtown London on the 12th, three hundred miles away, showed that radioactive dust had increased to twenty times the normal level.
    British authorities announced that milk in the danger zone has been contaminated by radioactive material and must be dumped into the sea. So far, milk from five hundred farms has been discarded. Pasture in the area has also been contaminated. Therefore, if dairy cows eat this pasture in the future, their milk will also contain excessive radioactive material, and thus is prohibited from being shipped out.
    On the 16th, leaders of the British Atomic Energy Authority ordered the shutdown of the plant's other atomic reactor in order to investigate the cause of the accident.
    It is revealed that this atomic energy plant is the main base for Britain's manufacture of atomic and hydrogen bombs. The British "Daily Express" said that this incident will have serious consequences for Britain's so-called "defense plan."

　　英国原子能工厂失事
    二百平方英里地区被宣布为放射性危险区
    五百个农场的牛奶受到沾染全部倾入海中
    新华社19日讯  伦敦消息：英国温兹凯尔一个原子能工厂最近发生了严重事故，大量放射性物质散布出来，引起了英国当局巨大的惊慌。这个工厂的五百名工人15日晚间在工厂前举行集会，要求当局重新检查一切设备。考尔德豪尔原子能电力站的建筑工人16日也举行了抗议性的群众大会。
    这座生产钚的原子能工厂有两个原子反应堆，其中的一个在10日忽然发生过热现象，原子反应堆本身遭到了巨大的破坏，已经不能再用；同时，大量的放射性碘从反应堆的大烟囱里散发出来。
    连日来，事态继续扩展。出事地点周围二百平方英里地区已经被宣布为放射性危险区。工厂四周空气中的放射性物质有增无已。远在三百英里以外的伦敦市区，12日测量的结果，放射性尘埃已经增加到正常水平的二十倍。
    英国当局宣布，危险区的牛奶已经受到放射性物质的沾染，必须倾入海中。到现在为止，已经有五百个农场的牛奶倒掉。这个地区的牧草也受到了沾染，因此，乳牛今后如果吃这种牧草，牛奶也会含有过多的放射性物质，因而被禁止外运。
    16日，英国原子能机构的领导人已经下令把这座工厂的另一个原子反应堆停止工作。以便检查事故发生原因。
    据透露，这座原子能工厂是英国制造原子弹和氢弹的主要基地。英国“每日快报”说，这次事件将对英国的所谓“防御计划”产生严重的后果。
