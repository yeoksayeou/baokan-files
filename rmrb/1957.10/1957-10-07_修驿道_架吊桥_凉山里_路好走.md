　　Repairing Post Roads, Building Suspension Bridges
　　Roads in Liangshan are Easier to Travel

　　This newspaper reports that under the oppression of successive reactionary rulers, the Yi people of Liangshan, Sichuan Province, who had always adhered to the attitude of "You have thousands of troops and horses, I have the old forests of ten thousand mountains," and were unwilling to build roads, are now enthusiastically participating in building bridges and roads and improving transportation conditions after liberation.

　　In recent years, the counties of Liangshan have built forty post roads, totaling 1,600 kilometers in length. The Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture County Chief Conference recently decided to build another 3,000 kilometers of post roads to complete the post road network of Liangshan.

　　Liangshan has many small rivers and deep ditches. In the past, the Yi people used single-cable bridges, twisting the cables with their hands and feet to cross, stepping on the single cable with their feet, or wading across, often resulting in drownings. In recent years, the People's Government has built eight wire rope suspension bridges in the five counties of Meigu, Puhong, Xialuo, Butuo, and Jinyang in Liangshan, and two wire rope suspension bridges in Yuexi and Puge are also under construction. In addition, sixty other bridges have been built. The traffic problems on the rivers and deep ditches of the main roads in Liangshan have been basically solved.

　　Highway construction in the Liangshan area has also begun. The Huhong Highway, which runs through the three counties of Xide, Puhong, and Yuexi, is under construction. The second highway trunk line—the Chengjia Highway—has begun surveying.

    修驿道  架吊桥
    凉山里  路好走
    本报讯　在历代反动统治者的压迫下，一直抱着“你有千军万马，我有万山老林”的态度，不愿修路的四川省凉山彝族同胞，解放后，踊跃参加修桥辟路，改善交通条件。
    凉山各县几年来已修筑了四十条驿道，共长一千六百公里。最近凉山彝族自治州县长会议决定，还要修筑驿道三千公里，完成凉山的驿道网。
    凉山小河和深沟很多。过去彝民都采用独索桥，用手脚纽索而过，或用脚在独索上踩过，或者涉水而过，常常淹死人。几年来，人民政府已在凉山的美姑、普厷、呷洛、布拖、金阳五县修筑了八座铅丝吊桥，还有越嶲，普格两座铅丝吊桥正在施工。此外还修建了其他桥梁六十座。凉山要道的河渠深沟上的交通问题，已经基本上解决。
    凉山地区的公路建设也开始了。贯通喜德、普厷、越嶲三个县的滬厷公路，正在施工。第二条公路干线——成嘉公路，已经开始踏勘。
