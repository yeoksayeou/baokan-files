Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 14th:  Women in Changshan Township, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, have raised their socialist consciousness through great debate. More than two thousand women in this township participated in the great airing of views, great blooming of ideas, and great debates, accounting for more than 90% of the adult women in the township. Female members of various agricultural cooperatives put forward more than 250 opinions, the vast majority of which were correct. In the debate, many women recalled how they couldn't get enough to eat before liberation, and after giving birth, they could only eat coarse grains, seeds, snails, and even grass roots. Comparing the past and the present, they unanimously realized that everyone can have food only with the unified purchase and sale of grain, and they put forward many ways to save grain. Through the debate on the issue of cooperativization, female members also realized that the victory over the typhoon disaster last year was due to the strength of the cooperative. Thirty-nine women exposed the capitalist ideas of some wealthy peasants and their acts of sabotage against the cooperative. Many women also mobilized their husbands to fight against bad people and bad deeds.

After the great debate, women expressed their willingness to take the socialist road. Hui Rong’s wife, who had withdrawn from the cooperative, told of her hardships after withdrawing and has reapplied to join the cooperative.

After the great airing of views, great blooming of ideas, and great debates in the township, nearly a hundred female activists emerged. The labor attendance rate of female members in the seven agricultural cooperatives in the township is above 90%. Female members of various cooperatives and production teams have also formulated three loves (love the country, love the cooperative, love the family) and two diligences (diligently manage the cooperative, diligently manage the family) covenants, preparing to conduct regular inspections in the future.

The General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Changshan Township has studied the opinions put forward by the women and will resolve what can be resolved as soon as possible. For example, accepting the opinion that there was a lack of leadership in women's work in the past, the General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in the township and the branch offices of each cooperative have designated special personnel to be responsible for women's work. Attention is paid to arranging light work for pregnant women, and the cooperative also provides certain care for postpartum women based on their economic and labor situation. Each cooperative is also inspecting the implementation of equal pay for equal work for men and women.

    通过辩论觉悟提高
    长山乡出现大批妇女积极分子
    新华社杭州14日电　浙江省萧山县长山乡妇女通过大辩论提高了社会主义觉悟。这个乡有两千多妇女参加了大鸣大放大争，占全乡成年妇女90％以上。各农业社的女社员共提出了二百五十多条意见，这些意见绝大多数都是正确的。在辩论中，许多妇女都回忆了解放前吃不饱，生了孩子之后就吃杂粮、草子、螺丝甚至吃草根。前后对比，一致认识到只有粮食统购统销大家才有饭吃，并提出了许多节约粮食的办法。通过合作化问题的辩论，女社员们也认识到去年战胜台风灾害是合作社的力量，有三十九个妇女揭发了一些富裕农民的资本主义思想和破坏合作社的行为，不少妇女还动员丈夫向坏人坏事作斗争。
    经过大辩论后，妇女纷纷表示要走社会主义道路，原来退社的惠荣嫂，诉说了自己退社后的苦处，已重新要求入社。
    全乡大放大鸣大争后，共出现了近百名妇女积极分子。全乡七个农业社的女社员，劳动出勤率都在90％以上。各社和各生产队的女社员，还订出了三爱（爱国、爱社、爱家）二勤（勤俭办社、勤俭治家）公约，准备今后经常检查。
    中共长山乡总支部对这次妇女们提出的意见，都作了研究，能解决的尽早解决。如接受过去对妇女工作缺乏领导的意见，中共乡总支和各社分支都确定专人负责妇女工作，对孕妇注意安排轻工，对产妇社里也根据妇女经济、劳力情况给予一定照顾，各社还正在检查贯彻男女同工同酬的工作。
