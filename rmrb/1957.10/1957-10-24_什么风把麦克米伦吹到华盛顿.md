    What Wind Blew Macmillan to Washington
    By Pan Fei, our correspondent
    Just seven hours after the Queen of England returned to London from the United States, Prime Minister Macmillan promptly left London and flew to Washington. This shuttle-like back-and-forth of British leaders is by no means a mere coincidence. In recent days, newspapers here have extensively reported on the warm reception the Queen received in the United States. Her visit created a rare "harmonious" atmosphere for the "Anglo-American alliance" in recent years. Now, it is Macmillan's turn to deal with Eisenhower and resolve practical issues.
    British newspapers believe that Macmillan should seize this "great opportunity" to "mend and strengthen" the Anglo-American alliance. It is revealed that Macmillan will discuss two main issues with Eisenhower: first, to formulate a "firm, clear, and fully consistent" common policy on the Middle East issue; and second, how to enable the United Kingdom and the United States to "share secrets in nuclear scientific research."
    It is said that Macmillan will play a "peacemaker" role in the Middle East issue, just as Eisenhower played in the Suez Canal issue. This analogy is clearly unrealistic. If the United Kingdom truly hopes to ease the tense situation in the Middle East, then it would not reject the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a great power conference to discuss the Middle East issue, or the initiative on the major powers guaranteeing not to use force in the Middle East. But the fact is: the United Kingdom rejected these peace proposals and believes that the Soviet Union's accusation against the United States for carrying out aggressive activities in the Middle East is not true. It is not difficult to discern: in the Middle East issue, is the United Kingdom playing the role of a "peacemaker," or is it supporting the United States' aggressive policy?
    Of course, it cannot be said that the United Kingdom has no complaints or dissatisfaction with the United States' Middle East policy. However, this complaint and dissatisfaction are only because the United Kingdom's interests in the Middle East have been squeezed out by the United States. The "Daily Telegraph" editorial on the 22nd wrote: "For a year, the United States has been almost unconstrained in the Middle East. But no one can say that this result is gratifying." This is the objective background for the Anglo-American talks. It is reported that Macmillan will propose a Colombo Plan for the Middle East to Eisenhower as the basis for a common Middle East policy between the two countries. Turning the "Eisenhower Doctrine" into "Eisenhower-Macmillan Doctrine" is one of the purposes of the British Prime Minister's visit to the United States. However, this task is clearly too arduous for Macmillan.
    Another purpose of Macmillan's visit to the United States is to persuade the United States to cancel or revise the McMahon Act, establish cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States in atomic energy, nuclear weapons production, and intelligence on rockets, missiles, and other military technologies, in order to further expand the nuclear arms race. It is said that Macmillan brought a so-called "Space Age Charter" to Washington. This plan proposes a plan for broad cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States in the above aspects. The United Kingdom believes that after the Soviet Union's successful testing of intercontinental missiles and launching of artificial satellites, the United States will be more likely to accept the United Kingdom's proposals. Regardless of whether the United Kingdom's assessment is correct, one thing is very clear: at a time when the notorious deterrence policy has been completely bankrupt, the United Kingdom is still trying to strengthen and expand this policy, and the result can only be to put itself in a more tragic situation.
    The British Conservative government is expecting Macmillan to return with a "satisfactory" agreement to consolidate Britain's international standing and improve the Conservative Party's situation at home. However, some insightful people in the United Kingdom believe that the path it has chosen is dangerous. Labor MP Crossman wrote: "I am quite sure that at the end of their talks, we will read another empty communique. We will hear: 'A common determination to regain the West's advantage in nuclear weapons' and 'Resolute support for Arab governments to keep communism out of the Middle East'. I am afraid... the Conservatives in London and the Republicans in Washington will go from one disaster to another." People cannot help but think that Crossman's prediction and judgment are convincing. (Dispatch from the 23rd)

### 什么风把麦克米伦吹到华盛顿

    什么风把麦克米伦吹到华盛顿
    本报记者　潘非
    在英国女王从美国回到伦敦的七个小时之后，麦克米伦首相又紧接着离开伦敦，飞往华盛顿去了。英国首脑穿梭似地一来一往，这决不是偶然的巧合。连日以来，这里的报纸大量地报道了女王在美国所受到的热情款待。她的访问，为“英美联盟”创造了几年来少见的“融洽”气氛。现在，轮到麦克米伦去同艾森豪威尔打交道，解决实际问题了。
    英国报纸认为，麦克米伦应该抓住这个“大好机会”，来“弥补和加强”英美联盟。据透露，麦克米伦要同艾森豪威尔讨论的，主要有两个问题：一是在中东问题上，制定一个“坚定的、明确的、充分一致的”共同政策；二是如何使英美两国“共享核子科学研究上的秘密”。
    据说，麦克米伦将在中东问题上扮演一个“和事佬”的角色，如同艾森豪威尔在苏伊士运河问题上所扮演的角色一样。这种比喻，显然是不现实的。如果英国真的希望缓和中东紧张局势，那么它就不会拒绝苏联关于召开大国会议以讨论中东问题的建议，关于各大国在中东保证不使用武力的倡议。但事实是：英国拒绝了这些和平建议，并认为苏联对美国在中东进行侵略活动的指责是不真实的。这就不难辨别：在中东问题上，英国究竟是充当了“和事佬”的角色呢，还是支持了美国的侵略政策？
    当然，不能说英国对于美国的中东政策没有什么抱怨或不满。但是，这种抱怨和不满，只是因为英国在中东的利益受到了美国的排挤。“每日电讯报”22日的社论写道：“一年来，美国在中东几乎是不受任何约束的。但是没有一个人能说，这种结果是值得高兴的。”这就是英美举行会谈的客观背景。据悉，麦克米伦将向艾森豪威尔提出一个中东的科伦坡计划，作为两国共同的中东政策的基础。把“艾森豪威尔主义”改变成“艾森豪威尔—麦克米伦主义”，这是英国首相访问美国的目的之一。但是，这个任务对于麦克米伦来说，显然是过于艰巨了。
    麦克米伦访美的另一目的，是说服美国取消或修改麦克马洪法案，建立英美在原子能、核武器生产和火箭、导弹及其他军事技术情报上的合作，以进一步扩大核子军备方面的竞赛。据说，麦克米伦带了一个所谓“空间时代宪章”到华盛顿去。这个方案提出了英美两国在上述各方面实行广泛合作的计划。英国认为，当苏联试验洲际导弹和发射人造卫星成功以后，美国将更容易地接受英国的建议。不管英国的估计是否正确，有一点是十分明显的：当臭名昭著的威慑政策已经宣告彻底破产的今天，英国还在企图加强和扩大这一政策，结果只能使自己陷于更加悲惨的境地。
    英国保守党政府正期待着麦克米伦能够带着一个“圆满的”协议回来，以巩固英国的国际地位并改善保守党在国内的处境。但是，英国一些有见识的人士，认为它所选择的道路是危险的。工党议员克劳斯曼写道：“我相当地肯定，在他们的会谈结束时，我们将读到又一个空虚的公报。我们将听到：‘夺回西方在核武器优势方面的共同决心’和‘坚决支持阿拉伯政府把共产主义拒于中东之外’。我担心……伦敦的保守党和华盛顿的共和党，将从一个灾难走向另一个灾难。”人们不能不认为，克劳斯曼的预言和论断，是可以信服的。　（23日电）
