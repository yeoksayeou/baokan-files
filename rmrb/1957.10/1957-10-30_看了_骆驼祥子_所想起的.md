    Lao She's "Rickshaw Boy," written twenty years ago, very meticulously depicted the life of rickshaw pullers. The characters he created, such as Xiangzi, Tiger Girl, Er Qiangzi, and Little Fuzi, all left unforgettable impressions on people. Especially Tiger Girl's fiery and forthright personality, which practically leaped vividly before the reader's eyes.

    The political environment of twenty years ago led the author to only write about the tragic fate of rickshaw pullers, without being able to point out their way out. The original theme was to illustrate that the rickshaw puller, as a typical product of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, had no way out. Even a strong person like Xiangzi was destined to fail if he relied solely on his own efforts. The author also wrote about how Xiangzi, under the pressure of various conditions in the old society, kept falling as if into a bottomless pit.

    Now, the Beijing People's Art Theatre's performance of "Rickshaw Boy" has slightly changed the original author's theme, pointing out that rickshaw pullers were not entirely without a way out. The adapter, Mei Qian, portrayed Tiger Girl as a daring and anti-feudal woman, one who sacrificed herself for Xiangzi out of deep love, not someone who contributed to Xiangzi's downfall. This slight change in theme does not prevent the several characters originally very successfully created from still being vividly active on stage. Shu Xiuwen's portrayal of Tiger Girl and Li Xiang's portrayal of Xiangzi both left extremely deep impressions on the audience. This creative adaptation and performance is a gratifying event in the theater world. It shows how vast a free world we have today for creating or adapting old works. As long as we grasp the correct ideology, we can give new life to old characters, not only without damaging the original image, but also making these characters appear more amiable and beloved in the eyes of readers and audiences.

    As a play, one must of course consider the dramatic elements in every aspect. However, if the play is entirely focused on the love story of Xiangzi and Tiger Girl while disregarding everything else, it will not become a play in the end. The stage version of "Rickshaw Boy," like the novel, is not limited to writing about Xiangzi's experiences on one line. It also branches out into many subplots, showing the development of several groups of characters in parallel, thereby achieving the purpose of setting off the main theme. In this regard, it reminds one of Gorky's "The Lower Depths" and Xia Yan's "Under the Eaves of Shanghai." Although there are many threads, they are not chaotic. Many subplots serve the main line like stars surrounding the moon. The conflict between Xiangzi, Tiger Girl, and Liu Si is a main line, while Er Qiangzi, Sister-in-law Er Qiangzi, and Little Fuzi are another line, and Old Ma and Little Ma are another line. Big guy, Little Shunzi, Tie Dan, and others each have their own line. Professor Cao, and even Sun San, can also be said to each have a line. These lines develop in an interwoven manner, with Xiangzi and Tiger Girl's main line running through the entire play, allowing people to see a relatively complete social picture of the eve of the Great Revolution thirty years ago, represented by the life of rickshaw pullers.

    This is where the stage play "Rickshaw Boy" succeeds. However, it also shows us some shortcomings. For example, the introduction of various character relationships is not placed in the first act, but in the third act. The tragic and comedic elements fluctuate like waves throughout the play. In particular, the incongruous shamanistic dance before Tiger Girl's death makes Tiger Girl die amidst the audience's laughter, which makes the overall tone of the play seem insufficiently harmonious.

    Xiangzi was born into a peasant family. He ran to the city to pull a rickshaw after going bankrupt in the countryside. He was doing it for a living, but he also wanted to get rich, and what dominated his thinking was the spontaneous force of capitalism. However, the spontaneous force of capitalism encountered the profession of pulling a rickshaw, which determined that it could not "develop." Pulling a rickshaw is individual labor, not collective production. Although there is some slight mutual assistance between rickshaw pullers, it is limited to "brotherly loyalty" and cannot form a huge force. The tragedy of the rickshaw puller lies here. When we hear Xiangzi shout from the stage, "No matter how good or strong you are, you can't twist against fate! I really don't know how to live!" When we see Tiger Girl, who is so powerful and capable, forced to die like a weak person, we cannot help but compare the new and old societies. We rejoice and celebrate living in today's new society, and we cannot help but be shocked by looking back at the old society. We more thoroughly generate hatred and abhorrence from the bottom of our hearts for the right-wing elements who attempt to restore the old system.

    Performing plays like "Rickshaw Boy" is to make us look back at the hateful and abominable past, thereby comparing the fortunate and lovable present, and generate the power to fight for today and tomorrow's cause. However, our strength does not always arise from reviewing the past. What can give us more inspiration and more lessons is the great construction cause and combative life that are being carried out today, as well as the future prospects seen from them. The task of our writers—novelists and playwrights—is to reflect today's reality in order to build socialism, to express the vigorous construction cause and struggle cause of today through artistic forms, to raise questions, solve problems, encourage our builders, and help our builders, and to carry out our literary and artistic work as an integral part of the entire socialist cause.

    While we are invigorated when we look back at the past, we want even greater strength from works with modern themes. However, looking around our theater world today, we feel that there are too few new works reflecting today's reality, which creates a strong demand for our playwrights to write more works reflecting today's great struggle life and construction cause, and for our theater groups to perform more plays in this area. Because only by reflecting modern themes and promoting the policies of the Party and the state can drama complete the major task of educating the working people. And what distinguishes spoken drama from other types of drama is precisely that it is most suitable for reflecting the most acute issues of modern times.

    看了“骆驼祥子”所想起的
    林陵
    老舍在二十年前写的“骆驼祥子”非常细致地描绘了洋车夫的生活，他所塑造的几个形象，如祥子、虎妞、二强子、小福子等，都给人留下难忘的印象。尤其像虎妞那种泼辣、爽朗的性格，简直是活蹦鲜跳地呈现在读者的眼前。
    二十年前的政治环境使作者只写出了洋车夫的悲苦命运，没有能指出他们的出路。原作的主题在于说明作为半殖民地半封建的旧中国的典型产物——洋车夫是没有出路的，即使像祥子这样好强的人，单靠一个人努力还是要失败的。作者还写出祥子在旧社会种种条件的逼迫之下，像掉进无底洞似地一直堕落下去。
    现在北京人民艺术剧院演出的“骆驼祥子”把原作者的主题稍微改变了一下，指出洋车夫并不是绝无出路的。改编者梅阡把虎妞写成一个敢作敢为的反封建的女子，写成一个因深爱祥子而为祥子牺牲的人，不是促成祥子堕落的人。主题的稍微改动，并不妨碍把原作中本来塑造得很成功的几个人物仍旧性格鲜明地活跃在舞台上，舒绣文演的虎妞，李翔演的祥子都使观众得到极为深刻的印象。这种创造性的改编和演出，是剧坛上一件可喜的事情，这说明我们今天的创作或改编旧作有着多么广阔的自由天地，只要掌握了正确的思想，就可以给旧人物赋予新生命，非但不损伤原来的形象，还使这些人物在读者和观众眼中显得更加亲切可爱。
    作为一个戏，固然要处处考虑到戏剧性，但是，如果把戏都放在祥子和虎妞的恋爱故事上而撇开了其他一切，结果反而不成为戏了。舞台上的“骆驼祥子”也像小说一样，不限于写祥子的遭遇这一条线，还分出许多支线，平行地表现好几组人物的发展，借此达到衬托总主题的目的。在这一点上，使人想起高尔基的“在底层”和夏衍的“上海屋檐下”，虽然头绪多，但并不紊乱，许多支线像众星拱月似地为一条主线服务。祥子、虎妞、刘四这三个人的纠纷是一条主线，二强子、二强嫂、小福子又是一条线，老马、小马是一条线，大个子、小顺子、铁旦等人各自有条线，曹教授，甚至孙三，也可以说各是一条线。这些线交织地发展着，而以祥子和虎妞的主线贯穿着整个戏，使人看到三十多年前大革命前夜以洋车夫生活为代表的一幅比较完整的社会图画。
    这是舞台剧“骆驼祥子”成功的地方。不过在这里，也使我们看到一些缺点，例如介绍各种人物关系的戏不是放在第一幕，而是放到了第三幕，悲剧与喜剧成分在全剧波浪式地起伏着，特别是虎妞死前来一场很不调和的跳神，使虎妞死在观众的笑声中，这就使整个戏的调子显得不够和谐了。
    祥子是农民出身，他在农村破产后跑到都市里来拉车。他是为了生活，但也想发财致富，支配他思想的是资本主义自发势力。但是资本主义自发势力碰到了拉车这个职业，决定它不能“发”下去。拉洋车是个体劳动，不是集体生产，虽然车夫们之间也有些微互助，但也只限于“哥儿们的义气”，不可能结成一个巨大的力量。洋车夫的悲剧就发生在这里。当我们听到祥子从舞台上喊出“不管你怎么要好、要强，可就拧不过这个命！我真不知道该怎样活？”的呼声时，当我们看到那样有魄力有能耐的虎妞被逼迫得像一个弱者而死去的时候，我们不禁要把新旧社会作一个比较，我们为生活在今天的新社会而欢欣庆幸，也由于回顾旧社会而禁不住心惊肉跳，对于企图使旧制度复辟的右派分子，更加透彻地从心底里产生出憎恶和痛恨。
    演出像“骆驼祥子”这样的戏，在于使我们回顾一下可憎可恶的过去，从而比较出今天的可幸可爱，产生出为今天和明天的事业进行斗争的力量。但是我们的力量并不总是产生在往事的回顾中，能使我们得到更多启示，更多教益的还是今天所进行着的伟大的建设事业和战斗性的生活以及从中所看到的未来的远景。我们的作家——小说家和剧作家的任务就在于为了建设社会主义反映今天的现实，把今天轰轰烈烈的建设事业和斗争事业通过艺术形式表现出来，提出问题，解决问题，鼓舞我们的建设者，帮助我们的建设者，把我们的文艺工作当作整个社会主义事业的一个组成部分来进行。
    在我们回顾过去而有所振奋的时候，更想从现代题材的作品中取得更大的力量，但是环顾我们今天的剧坛，觉得反映今天现实的新作品太少了，这就使我们产生了强烈的要求，要求我们的剧作家多写些反映今天伟大斗争生活和建设事业的作品，要求我们的剧团多演些这方面的剧本。因为戏剧只有反映现代题材，宣传党和国家的政策，才能完成教育劳动人民的重大任务，而话剧不同于其他剧种的地方，正就是它最适于反映现代最尖锐的问题。
