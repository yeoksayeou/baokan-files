As people enter the Exhibition of Evidence of Counter-Revolutionaries and Other Criminal Offenders, they see rows of machine guns, rifles, and pistols that once shot through the chests and foreheads of the people, daggers and sharp blades that once pierced the hearts and abdomens of the people, and piles of detonators and explosives used to blow up buildings. Radios, secret writing fluids, and maps and intelligence drawn by counter-revolutionaries, as well as files recording their crimes, are also displayed in stacks. An animated chart flashes eye-catching numbers: from June 1955 to the end of last year, more than 710,000 pieces of evidence of crimes by counter-revolutionaries were seized nationwide during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement.

The evidence exhibited at the meeting tells people that many counter-revolutionaries and bad elements have infiltrated state organs, schools, enterprises, and people's organizations. From July 1955 to the present, more than 88,100 counter-revolutionaries and bad elements have been purged from these departments. Among these counter-revolutionaries, some openly committed murder, arson, and bombings, while many more engaged in conspiracies in secret. For example, Zhang Biguang, a student at Guangzhou No. 13 Middle School, appeared to be a young and innocent student, but he was actually the leader of an intelligence group and the head of a radio station who had received rigorous special agent training in Taiwan. After infiltrating Guangzhou in 1955, he spied on and continuously sent intelligence about the People's Liberation Army's anti-aircraft artillery positions, radar equipment, etc., to special agent agencies in Hong Kong. Another example is the counter-revolutionary Zhuang Shimin, who infiltrated the Qitai Health Center in Xinjiang in 1952 and worked as a medical officer. He put on a clean white coat and deliberately killed revolutionary workers and the people by prescribing the wrong prescriptions and abusing drugs. When the suppression of counter-revolutionaries began, this counter-revolutionary's hatred for the people reached its extreme, and he broke into the ward with knives and axes, killing Liu Dianying, deputy director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the pregnant woman Zhao Fenglan, and three others who were hospitalized, and wounding the hospital director, nurses, health workers, cooks, and even visitors. Another example is Yang Yongren, who infiltrated the infrastructure team of the Zhangshu Rice Mill in Jiangxi. In addition to spreading various inflammatory rumors to workers, he cut off the telegraph wires, delaying the infrastructure project. Finally, he used kerosene cotton and other materials to set fire to the rice mill's warehouse, attempting to burn more than 2.7 million kilograms of grain and 400,000 yuan worth of factory buildings and machinery equipment.

The exhibition also tells people that many acts of sabotage are even more insidious and vicious. In a corner of the exhibition hall, a not-so-eye-catching case is on display. The counter-revolutionary criminal is named Li Shufang, and he is a car electrician at the Qingdao Railway Administration. In the evidence of this counter-revolutionary criminal, there are no knives or guns, only a small piece of stone. This small piece of stone is embedded in a component of a train generator. The narrator said: If it hadn't been discovered early, the motor would have burned, and a serious unfortunate event would have occurred on the passenger car. The lives of many people could have been destroyed in a very short time. It turns out that Li Shufang was a hidden agent of the Central Unification Bureau. In the past, he served as the secretary of a Kuomintang district branch and organized a Central Unification Bureau special agent communication group to collect intelligence and monitor the activities of progressive workers.

The cases exhibited tell people that counter-revolutionaries have not only infiltrated general organs and enterprises, but many have also infiltrated key departments or deceived their way into important positions. Look! A con man worked for five years and became the chief of the security section of a factory, and a con man obtained the title of "hero" and "meritorious official" and even participated in the presidium of the national delegation to comfort the People's Liberation Army. And the names of these people are not the already well-known Li Wanming, but Chen Tianfang and Huang Shigui.

It is also necessary to mention in particular Ke Changlin. Before his arrest, people could not find any flaws in him on the surface. Can you say that he doesn't look like the deputy director of the Nanchang Civil Affairs Bureau? Can you say that he is not the secretary-general of the Jiangxi branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang? Only in this large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement did his true colors become exposed. It turns out that the martyr Fang Zhimin was sacrificed at the hands of this executioner. The photo of the martyr Fang Zhimin and others in shackles when they were arrested in Yushan County, Jiangxi, which was hanging in the evidence, was also found in his home during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. He had kept this photo for more than 20 years until today. Why did he keep it for so long? It was to boast of his "achievements." Back then, it was hung in his office as the secretary of the Kuomintang Yushan County. After concealing his crimes, disguising himself as a democratic person, and infiltrating government organs, Ke Changlin also used his position to protect and cover up a group of counter-revolutionaries, including heinous landlords and despots who were extremely unpopular, and bandit leaders who continued to be enemies of the people after liberation and went up into the mountains.

The evidence exhibited at the meeting also tells people that the face of counter-revolutionaries lies is very broad and deep, and they are carrying out all kinds of activities in colorful disguises. Here is Yao Yezhong, who lived in a partition wall for five years and wrote 200,000 words of reactionary articles; here is Yang Jinxing, the murderer who disguised himself as a poor peasant and killed General Yang Hucheng and martyr Luo Shiwen; here is Wan Guoxiong, who disguised himself as a woman and carried out counter-revolutionary activities for five or six years; here are the capitalists Hong Bolian and Yu Daben, who used false names to send threatening, abusive, and rumor-mongering letters to sabotage various political movements, and who made their own explosives in an attempt to assassinate people.

The tragic case of the Shen Lintai family of seven in Fudu Township, Guantao County, Shandong, being killed by Shen Jichun and Shen Jilan once aroused the indignation of the people across the country; but this exhibition tells people that this is not an isolated incident. Exhibited here is also the case of Xing Dechang, a reactionary rich peasant in Dayushu Village in the suburbs of Shenyang, who hated the co-operative and the liberated peasants and killed the entire family of Li Jingyun, a poor peasant, consisting of eight people; Tang Shaohu of Chaishan Township, Huize County, Yunnan, killed the family of Chen Zhengmei, a people's representative in the township, consisting of nine people.

Counter-revolutionaries also carry out counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of religion. The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique is an example. The evidence of this clique occupies a large area of the exhibition hall. Here are their secret instructions and correspondence documents for sabotaging land reform, resisting America and aiding Korea, the peace movement, and various movements, policies and laws. They instructed "church members not to recognize the ownership of the land they have been allocated, and to return it to the landlords after the People's Government collapses," and they called the infinitely bright general line "the bloody general line." People can also see in the evidence bundles and stacks of land deeds or photographic films of land deeds. Among their evidence are a large number of guns, ammunition, military bayonets, and even gas masks and rubber boats, and piles of the Kuomintang's reactionary flags, as well as various cleverly modified code books for their contact with imperialism, and these things were found from their bishop's palace, from the Catholic church where Handel's solemn religious music was playing. The cracking of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique once caused a sensation, but there are still some people who have doubts about this case to varying degrees. Then, let these people come and see their evidence!

A large amount of evidence, as well as the facts of the case analyzed and verified according to the facts and reasons, gives people a deep impression: the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is based on rigorous and in-depth investigation and research, not only with on-site witnesses and physical evidence, but also with the heads of counter-revolutionaries who were cut off one or twenty years ago and photos of the victims, with blacklists, intelligence, maps written and signed by them... An electric map shows that before the arrest of Zhang Zhan'ao, the murderer of the "Thousand-Person Pit" massacre in Luan County, Hebei, our staff traveled more than 30,000 miles, 66 cities and remote villages, and spent three months to finally clarify his counter-revolutionary crimes.

Since the opening of the exhibition, all visitors have praised the great achievements made in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in the past. People angrily said: "So many fierce, cruel, and cunning bad people are hiding among our people. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries must be carried out, otherwise, the people's lives and property, and the country's socialist construction cause, cannot be guaranteed." A visitor from Wuhan wrote in the guestbook in an excited tone: "Let those right-wing elements who slander the suppression of counter-revolutionaries for messing things up come and see! Let the facts shatter their shameless faces." The reporter flipped through the guestbook and found that, in addition to expressing the above opinions and advocating that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries must be carried out, almost all visitors expressed dissatisfaction with the sentencing of certain cases, believing that the sentences for these counter-revolutionaries were too light. Some people even wrote the sentence "unlimited leniency" so excitedly in the guestbook, saying: "Don't forget that there are the words 'the people' above the court," and they even put forward specific opinions on the re-sentencing of certain cases.

    铁证如山
    本报记者　黄向青
    人们一走进反革命分子和其他刑事犯罪分子罪证展览会里，就可以看到一排排曾经射击过人民胸膛和脑门的机枪、步枪、手枪，曾经插进过人民心胸肚腹的匕首和利刃，一堆堆用作炸毁建筑物的雷管、炸药。电台、密写药水和反革命分子绘写的地图、情报以及记录他们罪状的案卷也成堆成叠地陈列着。一个电动图表闪烁着引人注意的数字：从1955年6月到去年年底，全国在肃反运动中缴获反革命分子的各种罪证就有七十一万多件。
    会中展览着的罪证告诉人们，许多反革命和坏分子已经混进国家机关、学校、企业和人民团体里。1955年7月到现在，就从这些部门中清查出八万八千一百多名反革命分子和坏分子来。在这些反革命分子中间，有的曾明目张胆地行凶杀人、放火爆炸，更多的是暗中进行阴谋活动。比如在广州市十三中学读书的张彼光，从表面看来这是个多么年青纯洁的学生，可他却是个在台湾受过严格特务训练的谍报组长兼电台台长。1955年潜入广州以后，曾经刺探和连续向香港的特务机关送递关于解放军高射炮阵地、雷达设备等等情报。又如反革命分子庄世民，1952年混入新疆奇台卫生院担任医士工作，穿起了洁白的衣裳，故意用错开药方、滥用药物的方法来杀害革命工作人员和人民。肃反开始，这个反革命分子对人民的仇恨达到极点，竟手执刀斧闯入病房，杀死留医的省农业厅副厅长刘殿英、孕妇赵凤兰等三人，又将该院院长、护士、卫生员、炊事员以至探病人员十一人砍伤。又如混进了江西樟树米厂基建队的杨永仁，他除了向工人散布各种煽动人心的谣言外，曾经剪断过引渡电线，使基建工程推延，最后他又用火油棉花等在米厂的仓库放火，企图把二百七十多万斤谷米和价值四十万元的厂房机器装备全部焚毁。
    展览会又告诉人们，还有许多暗害行为是更其阴险毒辣的。在展览室的一个角落里，陈列着一宗不太引人瞩目的案件，反革命罪犯叫李树芳，是青岛铁路管理局的车电员。在这反革命犯的罪证里面，没有刀枪，只有一小块石头。这一小块石头嵌放在一个火车发电机的机件里。讲解员说：如果不是及早发现，电机就要燃烧，客车将会发生严重的不幸事件。许多人的生命可能会在一个很短的时间内毁灭。原来李树芳是个暗藏的中统特务，过去，曾当过国民党区分部书记，又组织过中统特务通讯小组，搜集情报，监视进步工人活动。
    展览出来的案件告诉人们，反革命分子不但已经混进了一般机关和企业，而且有许多还混进了要害部门或骗到了重要位置。看吧！一个骗子手混了五年、当了工厂的保卫科长，一个骗子手混到了“英雄”“功臣”的称号、居然参加了全国慰问解放军代表团的主席团，而这些人的名字，不是已经人所共知的李万铭，而是陈天放、黄世贵。
    这里还必须特别提到的是柯常琳，在被捕之前，人们从表面上是找不出什么破绽来的，你能说他不像南昌市民政局的副局长吗？你能说他不是民革江西分部的秘书长吗？只有在这次大规模的肃反运动中，才露出了他的原形来。原来，方志敏烈士正是牺牲在这个刽子手手里。罪证中悬挂着的方志敏烈士等在江西玉山县被捕时带着镣铐的照片，也正是肃反中从他家里搜出来的。这张照片，二十多年来他一直保存到今天，为什么他保存这么久呢？是为了夸耀他的“功迹”。当年就曾经挂在他任国民党玉山县书记长的办公室里。柯常琳，在隐瞒罪恶，伪装民主人士，混进了政府机关以后，还利用职位，包庇掩护了一批反革命分子，其中有罪大恶极民愤甚大的地主恶霸，有解放后上山继续与人民为敌的土匪头子。
    会上展览的罪证还告诉了人们，反革命分子潜伏的面是很广很深的，他们披着五颜六色的外衣进行着五花八门的活动。这里有五年来住在夹墙里写了二十万言反动文章的姚也中；这里有装扮为贫农的杀害杨虎城将军和罗世文烈士的凶手杨进兴；这里有男扮女装进行反革命活动五、六年之久的万国雄，这里有冒名投寄恐吓谩骂造谣信件以破坏各项政治运动，和自制炸药企图暗杀的资本家洪伯廉和余大本。
    山东馆陶县浮渡乡申林台全家七口被申继春、申继兰杀害的惨案，曾经引起了全国人民的愤慨；但这个展览会告诉人们，这不是个别的事件。在这里展览出的，就还有沈阳市郊大榆树村反动富农邢德昌等仇恨合作化、仇恨翻身农民，杀害了贫农李景云的全家八口；云南会泽县柴山乡的唐绍虎，杀害了该乡人民代表陈正美一家九口。
    反革命分子还在宗教的掩护下进行反革命活动，龚品梅反革命集团就是一个例子。这个集团的罪证，占了展览室很大一块地方，这里有他们破坏土改、破坏抗美援朝、和平运动和各个运动、各类政策法令的秘密指示和来往文件。他们指示“教友不得承认分得土地所有权，可在人民政府垮台后归还地主”，他们把光芒万丈的总路线叫作
  “血淋淋的总路线”。人们还可在罪证中看见成捆成叠的地契或是拍摄下来的地契胶片。在他们的罪证中有着大批枪械、子弹、军用刺刀以至防毒面具、橡皮艇，有着一堆堆国民党的反动旗帜，还有他们同帝国主义连络的各类巧妙地改装过的密码本子，而这些东西，是从他们的主教府，是从那奏鸣着韩德尔的庄严的宗教乐声的天主教堂里搜出来的。龚品梅反革命集团的破获，曾轰动一时，但也仍有一些人对这案件或多或少地存疑。那么，让这些人来看看他们的罪证吧！
    大批的罪证，以及根据事实情理分析对证处理的案情，使人们获得一个深刻的印象：肃反工作是以严密深入的调查研究做基础的，不光有现场的人证物证，这里面还有一、二十年前反革命分子砍下来的人头和被害者的照片、有他们书写签署的黑名单、情报、地图……。一个电动地图显示：河北滦县“千人坑”大惨案凶手张占鳌在破获逮捕之前，我们的工作人员曾经跑了三万余里路、六十六个城市和荒僻的村庄，费时三个月，终于查清了他的反革命罪行。
    展览会开始以来，所有的参观者都同声赞扬肃反工作在过去所获得的巨大成绩，人们愤慨地说：“在我们人民里面潜藏着这样多凶狠残忍狡猾的坏人，肃反是必须进行的，不然，人民的生命财产，国家的社会主义建设事业，就无法保障了。”一个来自武汉的参观者在意见簿上用激动的语气写道：“让那些污蔑肃反搞糟了的右派分子来看看吧！让事实打碎他们不知羞耻的脸。”记者翻阅了意见簿，还发现参观者们除表示了上述的意见、主张必须进行肃反之外，几乎都提出了对某些案件量刑的不满意见，认为对这些反革命分子判刑轻了，甚至有人那么激动地在意见簿上大书“宽大无边”的句子，说：“别忘记法院上面有人民两字”，他们甚至对某些案件提出了改判量刑的具体意见。
