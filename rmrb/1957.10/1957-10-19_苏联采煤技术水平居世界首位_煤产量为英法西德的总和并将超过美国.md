　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th: According to Soviet newspapers: From 1913 to the present, global coal production has increased by less than double, while Soviet coal production has increased more than fourteenfold. During the same period, the proportion of Soviet coal production in the world's total coal production has increased from 2.4% to about 20%. Soviet coal production is now closely following the United States, and may surpass the United States in the near future.

　　World coal production has now increased from 1.225 billion tons in 1913 to over 2 billion tons. Statistical data shows that a considerable part of this increase is due to increased production in the Soviet Union. Because, in the past forty years, Soviet coal production has been rapidly increasing, while the coal production of the most coal-producing countries in the capitalist world, such as the United States, Britain, and West Germany, has been decreasing. Last year, Soviet coal production further increased to more than 429 million tons. In the first seven months of this year, the total Soviet coal production has exceeded 250 million tons.

　　Before the October Revolution, Soviet coal production ranked sixth in the world. Now it has far surpassed Britain, West Germany, and France in this regard, and has jumped to second place in the world. Its coal production is almost equal to the total coal production of these three countries.

　　Exploration work since the revolution has shown that the reserves of Soviet coal mines have increased compared to the past. Before the October Revolution, Russia was considered the country most lacking in coal mines. Due to vigorous exploration work, as early as 1937, the proven coal mine reserves in the Soviet Union had increased from 230 billion tons in 1913 to 1.65 trillion tons, second only to the United States in the world. After further exploration recently, Soviet coal mine reserves have approximately doubled again.

　　The distribution of the Soviet coal mining industry has also undergone significant changes. Now, the coal mining volume in the eastern regions alone has increased by more than three times compared to before the revolution, and their total coal mining volume accounts for 46% of the country's total coal production.

　　The technical equipment of the Soviet coal mining industry is also improving day by day. It is now the country with the highest degree of mechanization in the coal mining industry and the most coal mining combines in coal mines.

　　苏联采煤技术水平居世界首位
    煤产量为英法西德的总和并将超过美国
    据新华社莫斯科18日电  据苏联报刊报道：从1913年到现在，全世界煤产量增加还不到一倍，而苏联的采煤量却增加了十四倍以上。在同一时期，苏联煤产量在世界采煤总量中所占的比重已经从2.4％提高到20％左右。苏联现在的采煤量已经紧紧跟上美国，并有可能在不久之后超过美国。
    世界产煤量目前已从由1913年的十二亿二千五百万吨增加到二十亿吨以上。统计材料表明，这其中有相当大一部分是在苏联增产的。因为，最近四十年来，苏联的采煤量一直在迅速增加，而资本主义世界产煤最多的国家如美国、英国、西德等国的煤产量却在减少。到去年，苏联煤产量又进一步增加到了四亿二千九百多万吨，今年头七个月，苏联的煤产总量已超过了二亿五千万吨。
    十月革命以前，苏联的煤产量占世界第六位，现在它在这方面已经远远超过英国、西德和法国，而跃居世界第二位。它的煤产量差不多已等于这三个国家煤产量的总和。
    革命以来的勘探工作说明，苏联煤矿的蕴藏量比过去增加了。十月革命以前，俄国被认为是最缺乏煤矿的国家。由于大力进行勘探工作，还在1937年苏联已经勘探出的煤矿储量就由1913年的二千三百亿吨增加到一万六千五百亿吨，次于美国而居世界第二位。经过最近进一步勘探，苏联煤矿储量又增加了约一倍。
    苏联采煤工业的分布状况也发生了很大变化。现在，单是东部地区的煤田的采煤量就比革命前增加了三倍以上，它们的采煤总量已经占全国总产煤量的46％。
    苏联采煤工业的技术装备也在日益完善。现在是世界上采煤工业机械化程度最高和煤矿中采煤联合机最多的国家。
