The Rising Sun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, surpassed the production level of wealthy middle peasants within two years of becoming an advanced agricultural cooperative. The economic income of cooperative members has also reached or exceeded the level of wealthy middle peasants. This was confirmed by the work group of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party after conducting an economic survey of the cooperative in mid-September of this year.

The Rising Sun Agricultural Cooperative is located in Huayuantuo Township, Gaiping County. It was formed in the winter of 1955 during the high tide of collectivization, through the merger of eleven villages and twenty-five primary cooperatives in the township. At that time, it had 2,403 member households, a total of 1,905 hectares of cultivated land, 90,000 apple trees, 492 head of draft animals, and 214 carts.

The first year after collectivization brought an unprecedented bumper harvest. Although the cooperative reduced the grain sowing area by 145 hectares compared to the previous year, according to the state production plan, the total output still increased by 20.45% compared to 1955 due to the increase in yield per unit area. The cotton planting area increased by 126 hectares, and the yield per unit area increased by 51% compared to the previous year, with a total output increase of 71.6%. Of the 40,000 apple trees that bore fruit, the yields decreased slightly because of poor management in the small cooperatives, especially the "fixed small year of apple production" caused by the concept of "getting immediate benefits" during the individual farming period, which weakened the trees. However, as the cooperative took effective measures to improve quality, the rate of good fruit greatly increased, so the total output value still increased compared to 1955. In addition, diversified operations were developed in line with local conditions, expanding income.

The total income of the cooperative in 1956 was 2.08 million yuan, an increase of 32% compared to 1955. After deducting agricultural taxes and various expenses and public accumulation, the members' distribution accounted for 67.9% of the total income. The average distribution per household was 589 yuan, an increase of 29.7% compared to 1955. The average income per person was 109 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan compared to 1955. Adding the income from household sideline occupations, the actual income per person was 126.3 yuan.

Since the spring and summer of this year, the cooperative has suffered 73 days of severe drought. Before the threat of drought was relieved, more than 830 hectares of cotton and more than 40,000 fruit trees were severely damaged by cotton aphids and apple leaf rollers, followed by an outbreak of sorghum aphids. However, thanks to the large number of people and the great strength of the cooperative, it was able to resist disasters effectively and ensure timely crop growth. Now it appears that the output of all crops except potatoes will increase compared to last year.

It is estimated that this year, the cooperative's grain output will increase by 30,000 jin compared to last year, averaging 6,504 jin per hectare. In addition there will be 2.98 million jin of potatoes. The average cotton output per hectare will be 3,050 jin, an increase of 3% compared to last year. Apple production will increase by 38.6% compared to last year, and the quality will be greatly improved.

Judging from the trial calculation and distribution situation this year, the total income of the cooperative is expected to be 2.4 million yuan, an increase of 15.16% compared to last year. After deducting agricultural tax, public accumulation, and various expenses, the average distribution per member household will be 644 yuan, and the average distribution per person will be 119.6 yuan. Adding the income from each household's sideline occupations, the average actual income per household will reach 776.3 yuan, and the income per person will be more than 144 yuan. Compared with the average income of 99.4 yuan per person during the individual farming period of 20 upper-middle peasant households, it has increased by 44.86 yuan. The main reason why this cooperative has been able to increase production and income year after year is that it has brought into play the superior manpower, material resources, and financial resources of socialist large-scale agricultural production and implemented three basic measures to ensure increased production.

(1) Conducting land planning, rational land utilization, and planting suitable crops. The three villages in the northern part of the cooperative are low-lying, with simple production content and surplus labor. In the past, in order to solve the surplus labor force and complete the state cotton planting plan, they had to plant more cotton and less grain, but the cotton output was low. The four villages in the central part are flat, with high cotton yields, but in order to eat grain, they planted more grain and less cotton, but the grain yield was lower than in the north. The four villages in the south are surrounded by mountains and ridges, with a large number of barren mountains that can be planted with fruit trees, afforested, and developed for animal husbandry, but there is a shortage of manpower. Not only have the barren mountains not been fully utilized, but also soil erosion is serious. After the eleven villages were merged into one cooperative, the land was comprehensively planned, and crop areas were divided according to the principle of planting suitable crops in suitable areas: the northern region focused on developing grain, digging wells and repairing canals. Last year, 131 hectares of paddy fields were developed, yielding 940,000 jin of rice; a large amount of sorghum and corn were planted. The average sorghum yield per hectare in the cooperative increased by 1,960 jin compared to 1955, and the corn yield increased by 2,330 jin per hectare. At the same time, 110 hectares of intercropped potatoes and mountain kidney beans were planted, yielding more than 2 million jin. The central region focused on developing cotton, with cotton fields expanding to 297 hectares, and the yield per hectare increased by 988 jin compared to 1955. In the southern barren mountains, a large number of fruit trees were planted, reservoirs were built, terraced fields were built, soil erosion was prevented, and production was increased.

(2) Centralizing financial and material resources, carrying out basic construction, developing diversified operations, and expanding reproduction. During the period of individual farming and small cooperatives, many things that people wanted to do were beyond their ability, such as insufficient animal power, insufficient agricultural implements, and the inability to dig wells to open paddy fields. After the merger, 50,000 yuan of public accumulation funds from small cooperatives were concentrated, more than 260,000 yuan of equity funds were raised from members, and more than 380,000 yuan of production working capital were raised. According to production needs, 63 mules and horses, 35 carts, 5 electric well pumps, and 16 Liberation-style water wheels were added, and new agricultural implements such as seeders and double-wheeled double-铧 plows were purchased and put into production. According to the situation of less land and more people and surplus labor, the labor was divided and specialized according to the needs of production and life, and multi-department production and operation were carried out. In the past two years, they have purchased 17 electric rice milling machines, rice mixing machines, pulverizers, electric mills, blowers, etc., 4 cotton pressing machines, 10 rope hemp machines, and production tools such as woodworking and ironworking tools. They established small grain and rice processing factories, flour mills, cotton ginning and pressing factories, hemp rope factories, woodworking factories, iron furnaces, feed processing factories, sewing departments, etc., needed by the cooperative. They built 49 warehouses and livestock sheds (excluding pigsties), developed 117 cattle and horses, 1,560 pigs (including 500 sows), 325 sheep, and 1,500 chickens, and established a hatchery. In addition, members were organized to engage in sideline occupations such as weaving baskets, quarrying, raising fish, and transportation. In addition to the relatively fixed 200 people, the surplus labor force and semi-labor force were organized into production. In 1956, the income from diversified operations was more than 260,000 yuan, and it is estimated that it will be more than 480,000 yuan this year. Public accumulation has reached more than 590,000 yuan. The expansion of public property has laid a solid foundation for the further development of production in the cooperative.

Due to the development of diversified operations, the cooperative can often obtain cash income continuously, ensuring the advance payment of labor remuneration to members on a seasonal basis and providing assistance to poor members. For example, during the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, the cooperative advanced 45,000 yuan of labor remuneration, with an average of 9 yuan per labor force, and every family was overjoyed. Last year, Yu Wendou, a poor peasant, became ill. The cooperative lent him 200 yuan to go to Shenyang for treatment. After he recovered, he returned home to participate in production. Yu Wendou said: "Without the cooperative, my wife would have died and my children would have been scattered." The whole family was extremely grateful, and both husband and wife were active members in production.

(3) Rationally arranging labor and improving labor efficiency. The Rising Sun Cooperative paid attention to the characteristics of less land and more people, the imbalance of manpower among the villages, and the fact that women rarely had the opportunity to participate in production. The labor force was planned in a unified manner so that 5,000 laborers had work to do, thereby making the income of poor village farmers basically equal to the income of wealthy village farmers, and changing the unbalanced state of economic life among the villages. The way to solve this problem is to combine current production with long-term construction. According to land planning and crop planting plans, the labor required by each production department is allocated starting from the villages with more labor in the north, moving step by step to the south. Finally, the remaining labor in the southern region is used to carry out basic construction in the mountains. In the past two years, the cooperative has dug 83 wells, built a small reservoir, 750 meters of dikes, afforested 42 hectares, cultivated 250,000 seedlings, planted 14,200 fruit trees, built terraced fields for 6,000 fruit trees, and improved 210 hectares of soil. Last year alone, the amount of work invested in basic construction reached 250,000 workdays, and the number of women participating in production reached 800. The labor utilization rate has been greatly improved. Last year, the average number of workdays per male laborer reached 254 days, an increase of 72 days compared to 1955; female laborers worked 164 days, an increase of 50 days compared to 1955.

The Rising Sun Cooperative adopted the above measures, brought into play the superiority of socialist large-scale production, fundamentally solved the contradiction of unbalanced economic development among the villages, ensured comprehensive increase in production and income, and opened up broad prospects for the further development of the rural economy in the future.

    太阳升社两年赶过了富裕中农
    辽宁省盖平县太阳升农业生产合作社，建成高级农业社的两年期间，已经赶过了富裕中农的生产水平，社员的经济收入平均也家家都达到或超过了富裕中农的水平。这是今年9月中旬中共辽宁省委工作组到这个社进行经济调查后所证明的。
    太阳升农业社在盖平县花园坨乡，是1955年冬合作化高潮中，由全乡十一个村、二十五个初级社合并建成的。当时拥有社员二千四百零三户，共有耕地一千九百零五公顷，苹果树九万株，耕畜四百九十二头，大车二百一十四辆。
    合作化后的第一年，就获得了空前的大丰收。合作社根据国家生产计划要求，粮食播种面积虽然比前一年减少一百四十五公顷，但由于单位面积产量的提高，所以总产量仍比1955年增加20.45％；植棉面积增加一百二十六公顷，单位产量比前一年提高51％，总产量提高了71.6％；苹果结果树四万株，因为小社时经营不够好，特别是个体时期的现得利经营思想，造成树势衰弱，带来了“苹果产量的固定小年”，产量稍有下降，但由于合作社采取了有效的提高质量措施，好果率大大提高了，所以总产值仍比1955年有所增加。另外，因地制宜地发展了多种经营，扩大了收入。
    全社1956年总收入二百零八万元，比1955年增加32％，除农业税和各项开支、公共积累外，社员分配占总收入的67.9％；平均每户分得五百八十九元，比1955年提高29.7％，每人平均收入一百零九元，比1955年增加二十五元，加上家庭副业收入，每人实际收入则为一百二十六元三角。
    今年春夏以来这个社连续遭受七十三天大旱。干旱威胁尚未解除，八百三十多公顷棉花和四万多棵果树又受到棉蚜虫与苹果卷叶虫的严重为害，随而高粱蚜虫也猖獗起来。但由于合作社人多力量大，抗灾有力，战胜了重重灾害，保证了作物适时生育，现在看来，除土豆以外，各种作物的产量都能比去年有所增加。
    预计今年全社粮谷比去年增产三万斤，平均每公顷六千五百零四斤。另薯类二百九十八万斤。棉花平均每公顷三千零五十斤，比去年增产3％。苹果比去年增产38.6％，质量比去年大大提高。
    从今年试算试分的情况来看，全社预计总收入二百四十万元，比去年增加15.16％。除去农业税、公共积累和各项开支，每户社员平均可分六百四十四元，每人可分一百十九元六角，加上每户家庭副业收入，平均每户实际收入可达七百七十六元三角，每人可收入一百四十四元多。和二十户上中农单干时期的平均每人收入九十九元四角相比较，增加了四十四元八角六分，这个社所以能够连年增产增收，主要的是发挥了农业社社会主义大生产优越的人力、物力、财力条件，实行了三项保证增产的基本措施。
    （一）进行土地规划，土地合理利用，作物适地适种。这个社的北部三个村地势低洼，生产内容单纯，劳力有余，过去为了解决剩余劳动力和完成国家植棉计划，不得不多种棉少种粮，但棉花产量低。中部四个村地势平坦，棉花产量高，但为了吃粮，种粮多种棉少，而粮食产量却比北部低。南部四个村环山依岭，有大量荒山可以栽果树、造林、发展畜牧业，但人力不足，不但荒山未能充分利用，而且水土流失严重。十一个村合并为一个社以后，把土地作了全面规划，按适地适种原则划分了作物区：北部地区以发展粮食为主，打井修渠，去年开发水稻田一百三十一公顷，收获九十四万斤稻子；大量种高粱、玉米。高粱产量全社平均每公顷较1955年增加一千九百六十斤，玉米每公顷增加二千三百三十斤，同时套种马铃薯和山云豆一百一十公顷，收获二百多万斤。中部地区则以发展棉花为主，棉田扩大到二百九十七公顷，每公顷比1955年增产九百八十八斤。南部荒山则大量栽植果树，修水库、筑梯田，防止了水土流失，也增加了生产。
    （二）集中财力物力，进行基本建设，开展多种经营，扩大再生产。在单干和小社时期，许多想办的事无能为力，如畜力不足、农具不足、想开水田打不起井。并社后，把小社的公积金五万元集中起来，向社员募集股份基金二十六万多元、生产流动资金三十八万多元。根据生产需要添置骡马六十三匹，大车三十五辆，电井抽水机五部，解放式水车十六部，购置了播种机、双轮双铧犁等新式农具，全部投入生产。根据地少人多，劳动力过剩的情况，依照生产和生活的需要，按各人所长分工分业，开展了多部门的生产经营，两年来，他们购置了电动磨米机、搅米机、粉碎机、电磨、吹风机等十七部，压花机四部、绳麻机十部，以及木工、铁工等生产工具，建立了本社需要的小粮米加工厂、粉坊、弹花压花厂、麻绳厂、木工厂、铁炉、饲料加工厂、缝纫部等，修建仓库、畜舍（不包括猪舍）四十九间，发展牛马散畜一百十七头，猪一千五百六十头（其中母猪五百头），羊三百二十五只，成鸡一千五百只，并建立孵化场一处。此外，还组织社员搞编筐、打石、养鱼、运输等副业。以上各生产部门除了比较固定的二百左右人外，把剩余劳动力和半劳动力都组织到生产中来了。1956年多种经营收入二十六万多元，今年预计可收入四十八万多元。公共积累已达五十九万多元。公共财产的扩大，给社的进一步发展生产打下了巩固的基础。
    由于多种经营的发展，合作社能经常不断的获得现金收入，保证了按季给社员预付劳动报酬，并对贫困社员予以扶助。如在今年中秋节，全社预支劳动报酬四万五千元，平均每个劳动力分得九元，家家欢天喜地。贫农于文斗去年老婆病了，社借给他二百元到沈阳治病，病好后回家参加生产。于文斗说：“如果没有合作社，我就得妻死儿散了”。全家感激的了不得，夫妇都是生产中的积极分子。
    （三）合理安排劳动力，提高劳动效率。太阳升社注意到地少人多，各村之间人力不平衡以及妇女很少有机会参加生产的特点，把劳动力统一进行了规划，使五千名劳动力都有活干，从而使贫村农民的收入和富裕村农民收入基本相等，改变了各村之间经济生活不平衡的状态。解决这个问题的办法是：把当前生产与长远建设结合起来，根据土地规划和作物种植计划，按各生产部门所需要的劳动量，从北部劳动力多的村子开始分配，步步南移，最后南部地区使用剩余的劳力，进行山地的基本建设。两年来，全社打井八十三眼，修小型水库一处，撩?七百五十公尺，造林四十二公顷，育苗二十五万株，栽果树一万四千二百株，修了六千株果树的梯田，改良土壤二百一十公顷。去年一年投入基本建设的工量达二十五万个劳动日，妇女参加生产的已达八百名。劳动利用率大大提高了，去年男劳动力平均每个人的工作日达到二百五十四天，比1955年增加七十二天；女劳动力做一百六十四天，比1955年增加五十天。
    太阳升社采取以上措施，发挥了社会主义大生产的优越性，从根本上解决了各村经济发展不平衡的矛盾，保证了全面增产增收，给今后进一步发展农村经济开辟了广阔的道路。（中共辽宁省委工作组供稿，新华社记者胡枚正编写）
