Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, October 27th. The First National Congress of the Hungarian Communist Youth League opened on October 25th in the Parliament Building here. Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and state leaders Kádár, Fehér, Kállai, veterans of 1919, and some veteran factory workers attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Komócsin Zoltán, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Hungarian Communist Youth League, and Borbély Sándor, Secretary, respectively made reports on the work of the Preparatory Committee of the Communist Youth League and on the Constitution of the Communist Youth League.

In his work report, Komócsin said that along with the political and economic stability of the country over the past year, great changes have taken place in the ideological sentiments of Hungarian youth. More and more young people have realized that the Party, the government, and the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union have saved the youth. He said that the youth, especially the broad masses of working youth, are deeply convinced from their own experience that although the Party and the government are still in difficult circumstances, they have still made tremendous efforts to improve the situation of the youth and to improve the material and cultural lives of the youth.

Komócsin then affirmed the achievements of the former Hungarian Working Youth League. He said that the basic principles of the "League's" activities were correct. In its six years of work, it cultivated a large number of young people who were loyal to the people's democratic system and possessed a spirit of self-sacrifice. These young people have stood firm in their posts in political, economic, cultural life, and in the armed forces. But at the same time, the "League" also made mistakes.

When talking about the establishment of the Communist Youth League's organization, Komócsin said that according to the September materials, the Hungarian Communist Youth League now has 6,103 grassroots organizations and 169,072 members. 68% of the grassroots organizations are in factories and rural areas. One-third of the members are workers, and 52% are collective farmers or individual farmers.

Komócsin said that the Communist Youth League has achieved great success in eliminating the ideological influence of counter-revolutionaries and revisionism, and the League has always supported the Party's policies.

He also talked about the League's two slogans: "Loyal to the people, loyal to the Party" and "Be with all the youth." He said that the task of the Communist Youth League is to unite the broad masses of youth to move forward together and to struggle for the realization of the Party's policies. Some people believe that the slogan "Be with all the youth" has a compromising nature, but this worry is unfounded. We are willing to move forward with the youth, but this does not mean compromising with the hostile or wrong views of some young people and abandoning the viewpoint of class struggle. He said that in order to win the majority of young people, the members of the Communist Youth League must truly live together with the young people outside the League.

Komócsin said that the Communist education of the League should be strengthened, and ideological and political unity should be strengthened.

When talking about who can become a member, he said that any young man or woman who is politically pure and morally good, willing to participate in collective and social life, and consciously undertakes the obligations stipulated in the Constitution of the League can join the Communist Youth League.

When talking about launching nationwide movements, Komócsin suggested: The Communist Youth League should initiate a youth conservation movement and a tree-planting movement, and assist in some arduous domestic labors, such as participating in the construction of the Danube River dam, building houses and schools, etc. He also emphasized that in the next few months, special attention should be paid to the work of the League in secondary and higher schools.

In the report on the League's Constitution, Borbély pointed out that the Communist Youth League is a mass youth organization of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. It must also be a politically unified and strong organization. Therefore, it is expected that there will not be as many League members as there were in the past Hungarian Working Youth League.

After the reports by Komócsin and Borbély, the meeting began to hold discussions.

    团结广大青年为实现党的政策而奋斗
    匈牙利共青团举行全国代表会议
    据新华社布达佩斯27日电　匈牙利共产主义青年团第一次全国代表会议10月25日在此间国会大厦开幕。匈牙利社会主义工人党和国家领导人卡达尔、费赫尔、卡拉伊和1919年的老战士及一些工厂的老工人参加了这次会议。
    会上，匈牙利共青团筹备委员会主席科莫钦·佐尔坦和书记博尔贝伊·山多尔分别作了关于共青团筹备委员会的工作报告和关于共青团团章的报告。
    科莫钦在工作报告中说，一年来与国家的政治和经济稳定的同时，匈牙利青年的思想情绪也发生了很大的变化。越来越多的青年已经认识到了党和政府及苏联的兄弟般的帮助挽救了青年。他说，青年们，特别是广大的劳动青年，根据切身的体验已经深信党和政府虽然处境还有困难，但是为了改进青年状况，对改善青年的物质的和文化的生活仍然作了巨大的努力。
    科莫钦接着肯定了以前的匈牙利劳动青年联盟的成绩。他说，“联盟”活动的基本原则是正确的。它在六年的工作中培养了大批忠于人民民主制度、有自我牺牲精神的青年。这些青年在政治、经济、文化生活中和在武装部队中都坚守了岗位。但是同时“联盟”也犯了错误。
    科莫钦在谈到共青团建立组织的情况时说，根据9月份的材料，匈牙利共青团现在已经有六千一百零三个基层组织，十六万九千零七十二个团员。基层组织的68％是在工厂和农村。团员的成分三分之一是工人，52％是集体农民或个体农民。
    科莫钦说，共青团在消除反革命和修正主义的思想影响中获得了很大的成绩，团一直支持党的政策。
    他还谈到团的两个口号：“忠于人民、忠于党”和“同全体青年在一起”。他说，共青团的任务是团结广大青年共同前进，并且为实现党的政策而奋斗。有些人认为“同全体青年在一起”的口号带有妥协性，这种担心是没有根据的。我们愿意同青年们一起前进，但是这并不意味着同某些青年的敌对的或者错误的观点妥协和放弃阶级斗争的观点。他说，要想争取青年的大多数，那么共青团员们就必须真正地同团外青年生活在一起。
    科莫钦说，应当加强团的共产主义教育，加强在思想上和政治上的团结和统一。
    在谈到哪些人可以成为团员时，他说，凡是政治纯洁和道德良好，愿意参加集体和社会生活，自觉承担团章所规定的义务的男女青年都可以加入共青团。
    科莫钦在谈到开展全国性运动时建议：由共青团发起一个青年节约运动和植树运动，并且协助进行国内一些艰巨的劳动，如参加修建多瑙河堤坝、建筑住宅及学校等。他还强调在今后几个月内，要特别注意中等以上学校中团的工作。
    博尔贝伊在团章的报告中指出，共青团是匈牙利社会主义工人党群众性的青年组织。它还必须是一个政治上一致的坚强组织。因此，预料团员将不会像过去劳动青年联盟盟员那样多。
    科莫钦和博尔贝伊在报告之后，会议便开始进行讨论。
