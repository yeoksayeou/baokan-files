To its east and west, portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin stood in front of the red walls. In front of the square, 10,000 workers used red flowers as a background and yellow flowers to form the two large characters "National Day." To its east were the troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army preparing to be reviewed. Further east were the 500,000 people participating in the festival parade.

The viewing stands in front of Tiananmen Gate were filled with spectators.
