　　Crystals Everywhere in Wenshan
    A large amount of colorless and transparent crystal ore has been discovered in Guangnan, Funing, Maguan, Xichou, Malipo, Yanshan, and Wenshan counties of Wenshan Special District, Yunnan.

    According to Soviet experts, Wenshan Special District is the most promising area for crystal mining development in the provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan. Guangnan County has the highest crystal production, with crystals found in almost every district, earning it the title of "Crystal County." These crystal ores are generally exposed on the ground. Some are only one or two meters below the surface, making them very easy to mine. The largest crystal ore currently discovered is fifteen centimeters long and about ten centimeters in diameter. After identification, it has been confirmed that some crystal ores have 30% of their crystals suitable for use as piezoelectric quartz; in general, all can be used for smelting quartz.

    Crystal is an indispensable raw material in national defense and the chemical industry, and can also be used to make valuable ornaments.

　　文山到处有水晶
    云南文山专区的广南、富宁、马关、西畴、麻栗坡、砚山、文山等县，发现大量无色透明的水晶矿。
    据苏联专家说，文山专区是广西、贵州、云南等省开采水晶矿最有发展前途的地区。广南县的水晶矿产量最多，几乎各区都有，被人们称之为“水晶之县”。这些水晶矿一般都露出地面。有的只离地表一、二公尺，很易开采。目前发现的最大的水晶矿长的有十五公分，直径在十公分左右。经鉴定证实，有些水晶矿，有30％的晶体可用作压电石英；一般均可用作熔炼石英。
    水晶是国防工业和化学工业中不可缺少的原料，也可制作贵重的装饰品。
