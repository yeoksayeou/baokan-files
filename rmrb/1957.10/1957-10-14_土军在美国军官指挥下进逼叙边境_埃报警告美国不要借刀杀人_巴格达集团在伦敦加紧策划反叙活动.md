Xinhua News Agency report: According to reports, Egyptian newspapers on the 11th sternly warned the United States not to instigate Turkey to attack Syria again.

"The Republic" said that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles "is driving Turkey to launch an armed attack on Syria." The newspaper pointed out that the United States' pursuit of such a policy will only lead to repeated failures.

"Al-Ahram" demanded that Dulles guarantee that he would not try to instigate Turkey to attack Syria.

"Al-Akhbar" said: "The Arabs will never tolerate Turkey, whom they hate, interfering in their internal affairs. The wisest policy for Turkey is not to participate in American conspiracies."

Damascus' "Al-Jamahir" quoted official sources as saying that Turkish troops continue to mass near the Syrian border. The newspaper said that the North Atlantic Council, at a meeting not long ago, ordered the 5th Armored Division, stationed in Turkey and commanded by a high-ranking American officer, to advance towards the Syrian border. The armored division includes heavy tank detachments. This division is also equipped with a tank detachment of 170 other types of tanks. "Al-Jamahir" wrote that the tank force has a total of 670 tanks. This tank force is massing in the area of ​​Alexandretta, not far from the Syrian border.

The newspaper also reported that another 30,000 Turkish troops are being mobilized on the Syrian border.

Xinhua News Agency, October 13th: TASS, Cairo, October 12th: "Al-Masaa" published an article by its special correspondent from London, saying that the member states of the Baghdad Military Pact are intensifying their sabotage activities against Syria.

The article pointed out that the Baghdad Pact's so-called "Anti-Subversion Activities" committee has held several meetings in London in the past week. U.S. representatives attended all the meetings. The meeting focused particularly on the issue of mutual cooperation among the member states of the Baghdad Pact and the intensification of sabotage activities against Syria. According to the suggestions of the American representatives, the committee decided: to establish a joint dispatch center in Turkey to coordinate the reconnaissance activities of the member states of the Baghdad Pact, the United States, and Israel against Syria; to accelerate the establishment of armed groups in countries bordering Syria, send them to Syria to launch terrorist and subversive activities; and to accelerate the establishment of a "Syrian government in exile" that will be recognized by the member states of the Baghdad Pact and the United States.

    土军在美国军官指挥下进逼叙边境
    埃报警告美国不要借刀杀人
    巴格达集团在伦敦加紧策划反叙活动
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：埃及报纸11日严厉地警告美国：不要再作煽动土耳其进攻叙利亚这样的勾当。
    “共和国报”说，美国国务卿杜勒斯“正在驱使土耳其向叙利亚发动武装进攻”。报纸指出，美国执行这种政策，只会使自己接二连三地遭到失败。
    “金字塔报”要求杜勒斯保证他决不设法煽动土耳其进攻叙利亚。
    “消息报”说：“阿拉伯人决不会容忍他们憎恨的土耳其干涉他们的内政。对土耳其来说，最明智的政策是不参与美国的阴谋诡计。”
    大马士革“群众报”援引官方消息说，土耳其军队继续在叙利亚边境附近集结。这家报纸说，不久以前举行的北大西洋公约理事会命令驻在土耳其的由一个地位很高的美国军官指挥的第五装甲师向叙利亚边境推进。装甲师包括重型坦克分队。这个师还配备有一百七十辆其他类型坦克的坦克分队。“群众报”写道，坦克部队总共有六百七十辆坦克。这个坦克部队正在距叙利亚边境不远的亚历山大勒达地区集结。
    报纸还报道说，另有三万名土耳其军队正在叙利亚边境进行调动。
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社开罗12日讯：“晚报”刊载它的特派记者发自伦敦的一篇文章说，巴格达军事条约的成员国正在加紧对叙利亚的破坏活动。
    文章指出，一周来巴格达条约的所谓“反颠覆活动”委员会在伦敦举行了多次会议。美国代表出席了历次会议。这个会议特别着重地讨论了巴格达条约成员国互相配合的问题和加紧对叙利亚的破坏活动的问题。这个委员会根据美国代表的建议决定：在土耳其设立一个使巴格达条约成员国以及美国和以色列的侦察活动步调一致的联合调度中心来反对叙利亚；加速在和叙利亚毗邻的国家建立武装集团，把他们送到叙利亚去发动恐怖活动和颠覆活动；加速成立一个将会得到巴格达条约成员国和美国承认的“叙利亚流亡政府”。
