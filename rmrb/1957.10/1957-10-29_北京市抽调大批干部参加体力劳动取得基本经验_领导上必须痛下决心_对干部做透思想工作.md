Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: Beijing Municipality has, to date, sent over 16,000 cadres from agencies, organizations, enterprises, and universities to participate in physical labor in suburban rural areas and other labor fronts. How was this work carried out? A responsible person from the Beijing Municipal People's Committee gave a brief introduction at the request of a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the 28th.

The basic experiences presented by the responsible person of the Municipal People's Committee are: leaders must make a firm resolution; do a good job of ideological work with the cadres sent down, and at the same time, regard this work as a profound socialist education to educate all staff members. The responsible person also particularly mentioned that Beijing's cadre transfer this time is not a layer-by-layer process, but a direct placement to the grassroots.

The following is the conversation with this responsible person.

	Municipal leading cadres personally lead this work, strictly criticizing the erroneous ideas of some unit leaders who want to "take care" of cadres in this way and that way

The work of Beijing Municipality transferring cadres to participate in physical labor started in mid-August. Currently, this work has been carried out in various aspects, such as government agencies, Party and mass organizations, industry, construction, farms, commerce, institutions, and universities. After understanding the great significance of this work, the leaders of the vast majority of units are very determined and have formulated preliminary plans for drawing cadres to participate in labor production. Generally, they decided to draw 30% to 50%, and some units as high as 70% or more. Among the broad staff members, there is a boiling socialist revolutionary enthusiasm, and they have requested to go to the countryside to participate in labor in the first batch.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee have made the greatest determination for this transfer of cadres to participate in production in the countryside. After the Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Committee meeting made a decision, many responsible comrades of the Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Committee personally led this work. Before the transfer work began in the units under the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, they first convened a meeting of all bureau chiefs and district chiefs to get through the thinking of leading cadres. At the meeting, in addition to the vast majority of people supporting this measure, some people also raised some questions, such as emphasizing the need to "take care" of cadres, etc. This kind of thinking was strictly criticized. The meeting pointed out that the organization and work style of government agencies must be able to closely connect with the working masses and must adapt to the needs of socialist construction. This time, the cadres are going down to participate in labor production, and the set of life and political treatment in the agencies must be changed. If they are taken care of in this way and that way, cadres cannot be transferred at all. It is required that each unit should draw as many as possible and send as many as possible. Those who are transferred should not only be general cadres, but also some main cadres should be drawn as the backbone. At the meeting, everyone, in conjunction with the problems exposed in their own units over the past few years, such as overstaffing, low work efficiency, and the recent rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, further discussed and more deeply understood the important significance of this revolutionary measure. In addition to expressing their determination to draw cadres from their own units to go to the countryside to participate in labor production, everyone also expressed that they would like to go to the countryside to participate in production first. The municipal leaders also made it clear that the quality of this work, and the size of the resolution, is an important test of whether each leading cadre is determined to change their work style and overcome bureaucracy.

After the meeting, several deputy mayors and the secretary-general divided the work, closely grasped the reporting and inspection, and promptly solved problems when they were discovered. They talked to the leading cadres of the units with insufficient enthusiasm to help solve ideological problems. With the specific help of a deputy mayor, the Grain Bureau formulated a plan to draw 62% of the existing personnel to participate in labor after careful research. Because the municipal-level leading cadres were determined, personally took action, and grasped tightly, the bureau-level leading cadres also made up their minds. In addition to transferring 54.8% of its cadres, the Commercial Bureau also transferred 65.7% of the management personnel from its affiliated companies to participate in production. The managers of three companies were also transferred to participate in production.

	To thoroughly solve the ideological problems of cadres, the solution is to let everyone "state problems and raise difficulties," criticize wrong ideas through debate, and help solve reasonable demands as much as possible

After the leading cadres made up their minds, they had to do a good job of ideological work among the cadres, and it must be done deeply and thoroughly. This work was carried out in two stages. The first stage was to conduct general ideological mobilization, mainly through the general study of Mayor Peng Zhen's speech at the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress in early August. In that speech, Mayor Peng Zhen pointed out that in order to fundamentally overcome bureaucracy, change work styles, strengthen close ties with the working masses, better train cadres, implement the policy of increasing production and practicing economy, and building the country diligently and thriftily, and establish a social atmosphere of labor being glorious and diligence and thrift being valued, it is necessary to transfer 30% to 50% of the staff members in various agencies, institutions, and enterprises to participate in physical labor for a relatively long period of time. According to this instruction, each unit, in conjunction with its own specific circumstances such as bloated organization, overstaffing, low work efficiency, and detachment from the masses and reality, after repeated study and discussion, the vast majority of staff members expressed their support for this policy, and some people wrote letters of guarantee and applications to the leaders, requesting to be the first batch to participate in physical labor.

At this time, although the vast majority of people expressed their support for this policy, and a few people signed up to respond, the specific ideological problems had not yet been exposed. In order to deepen and thoroughly the ideological work, we put forward the standards of depth and thoroughness to each unit, that is, before the cadres are sent down, they must thoroughly solve ideological problems, so that they consciously and happily go to the production posts, and all staff members are fully mentally prepared for the issue of being sent down, so that once the leadership decides to send them down, they can happily go to the labor front.

In order to achieve the above standards, the ideological work entered the second stage - the stage of specifically and deeply solving ideological problems. First, let everyone "state problems and raise difficulties" so that all kinds of problems are exposed. Generally speaking, there are the following situations: Some intellectual cadres believe that asking them to participate in labor production is "making a mountain out of a molehill" and "waste of talent," fearing that it will affect their professional study and future. They are afraid of hardship, afraid that farmers are unhygienic, and are reluctant to leave urban life. Some also raised some difficulties in various aspects such as family life after participating in labor.

In order to solve these problems, the following methods were adopted: First, take the section and office as a unit to debate the above problems, and hand over some common problems for everyone to discuss, such as whether it is "making a mountain out of a molehill" for intellectuals to participate in labor? Is labor glorious, are the working people dirty? How to fundamentally change the situation of overstaffing in agencies, etc.; Second, organize cadres, especially intellectuals who have lived in the city since childhood and have not participated in labor, to visit agricultural production cooperatives; Third, try to help solve some reasonable and solvable difficult problems in life raised by cadres.

After debate and visits, many wrong ideas were criticized, and everyone's understanding was jointly improved. Many cadres pointed out that intellectuals who have not undergone fundamental transformation are unaccustomed to physical labor and do not know the five grains. They do not have any production knowledge and are not familiar with workers and peasants. In this case, if they are determined to be cadres of a socialist country, they must go to grassroots production units to participate in physical labor. This is the most fundamental method for intellectuals to carry out self-transformation, and it is by no means a "making a mountain out of a molehill." Many old cadres also realized that although they have been tested, they have been staying in urban agencies for a long time in the past eight years since liberation, and have gradually become estranged from the working masses. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen ties with the masses by participating in physical labor. Some people who thought that participating in labor was "shameful," said that "farmers are dirty" and had fears of hardship, etc., after discussion, also realized that this is a shameful bourgeois ideology, which is incompatible with the thoughts of a Communist Party member, a Communist Youth League member, and a revolutionary cadre of a state agency. After some people visited the agricultural production cooperatives, they also saw that the new socialist countryside has broad development prospects, and it urgently needs a large number of cadres to carry out construction. Therefore, everyone made up their minds to pass the socialist revolution.

After the above work, the broad staff members had a more specific understanding of the significance of participating in labor, and they asked the leadership for the first batch of people to be sent down. On this basis, the list of those to be sent down was approved.

The cadres who are determined to stay in the agency, according to the situation after the reduction of personnel, also actively undertake all work tasks with the spirit of "one person being as good as two." They and the cadres who were sent down to participate in production put forward the slogan of competition. The personnel who were sent down expressed that they would reap both labor and ideological harvests on the labor front, and the cadres who stayed in the agency expressed that they would further connect with the masses and do a good job in the agency with a spirit of diligence and thrift.

Cadres' determination to participate in labor production is the result of fierce ideological struggle. Transferring a large number of cadres to participate in labor production is a revolutionary measure to improve work, train, and cultivate cadres, and it is also a huge change in one's thinking and a profound revolution. On the issue of going or not going, many cadres considered: Do I want to fight for socialism to the end? Are there conditions for participating in the revolution? How can I keep up with the times? In order to answer these questions, many people stayed up all night, and the ideological struggle was extremely fierce. After this ideological struggle, their socialist consciousness was greatly improved, and they made up their minds to participate in production.

After the cadres made up their minds, almost all cadres with families automatically convened family meetings. At the family meeting, in addition to the majority of families expressing their support, some families also felt that participating in labor was "shameful" and raised various difficult problems in family life. This was the first serious test for the cadres' determination, and the ideological struggle was even more intense than before. Only after persuading and mobilizing family members and making proper arrangements in life did they get through the "first hurdle."

In order to consolidate the emotions of the cadres sent down, each department held farewell parties when the cadres were sent down; after they went down, the heads of many units also personally visited them to understand their difficulties and demands, and some units also sent cadres to visit their families to help specifically solve some difficulties in life. These works played a great role in the cadres' peace of mind in production.

	It is necessary to do a good job in specific organizational work, who will go to labor, who will stay in the agency, should be considered and decided according to the principle of taking into account strengthening the work of the agency and training and transforming cadres.

While doing a good job in ideological work, it is also necessary to do a good job in specific organizational work. Beijing Municipality decided who will stay in the agency and who will be sent down to production based on the spirit of strengthening the work of the agency and training and transforming cadres cannot be neglected. For old, weak, and sick cadres who cannot work or participate in labor production, they can be dealt with by means of retirement, resignation, or long-term recuperation. All units with cadres to be sent down must, before the cadres are sent down, specifically contact the relevant agricultural production cooperatives in accordance with the unified arrangements of the city, introduce them to the situation of the cadres to be sent down, and specifically arrange the eating, living, and other problems of the cadres to be sent down. At the same time, they should also introduce the cadres to be sent down to the situation of the agricultural production cooperatives they are going to, and explain that after going down, they must obey the leadership of the agricultural production cooperatives and strictly abide by labor discipline. A member meeting should also be held in the agricultural production cooperative to clarify the significance of the cadres being sent down, so as to avoid some unnecessary misunderstandings.

Now, the vast majority of the cadres sent down are performing very well in the countryside. They eat, live, and work with the farmers, and their labor enthusiasm is very high. Although many people have blisters on their hands and their shoulders are red and swollen, their labor enthusiasm is very high. A party member cadre from the Grain Bureau did heavy work as soon as he went down, and the agricultural cooperative recorded 110 work points for him in ten days. Now some people have begun to formulate next year's production plan. Generally, cadres who have been down for about a month have greatly changed their appearance in the agency. Everyone's face is black and red, and their relationship with the masses is as close as family. Especially some old cadres with mass work experience, in addition to actively engaging in labor production, chat with the folks when they are free, and they rush to do all the work of the masses. Sun Shikui, a cadre from the Fengtai District Public Security Bureau, fetched water, swept the yard, washed vegetables, and held children for his landlord after work. The old landlady affectionately called him her son. The masses have a good response to the cadres sent down, saying: These people are all good, and they can be good cadres in the future.

The biggest gain for the cadres sent down is that they know that a grain of grain and a vegetable leaf are hard-won, they truly understand the significance of labor for creating material wealth, and they also pay attention to saving. A female cadre who participated in vegetable field production once went home and saw that her family only ate the heart of the cabbage when eating cabbage, and threw away many cabbage leaves. She felt very sad and said to her family: "You don't know how difficult it is to grow a cabbage!" Another gain is that the class consciousness has been universally improved, and the class viewpoint is clearer and more concrete than in the agency. In the countryside, rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants have obviously different views on many issues, and their attitudes towards the cadres sent down are also different. For example, if a cadre accidentally broke his hand during production, an old poor peasant woman tore her own clothes to bandage the cadre, while the rich peasant spoke coldly to the cadre. These concrete facts have a great educational effect on cadres. Now they universally demand to study the Party's various policies in the countryside.

After the cadres were sent down, the social atmosphere also changed: High school and middle school graduates in the countryside who failed to enter school and participated in agricultural production were at ease with production; in the past, labor employment registration in the city never required people to go to rural production, but now some people have begun to register and ask to go to rural production.

How the cadres sent down can settle down and engage in agricultural production for a long time, and how to integrate with the masses in terms of ideological feelings and living habits, still requires a period of hard training. In addition, how to manage and educate the cadres sent down, how to stipulate their production quotas, and many other specific issues still need to be further studied and resolved in the future.

    北京市抽调大批干部参加体力劳动取得基本经验
    领导上必须痛下决心  对干部做透思想工作
    新华社28日讯　截至最近止，北京市机关、团体、企业、高等学校下放到郊区农村和其他劳动战线上参加体力劳动的干部已有一万六千多人。这项工作是如何进行的？北京市人民委员会负责人28日应新华社记者的要求，作了简要的介绍。
    市人民委员会负责人介绍中提出的基本经验是：领导下决心；对下放干部作好思想工作，同时把这项工作作为一次深刻的社会主义教育，来教育全体工作人员。负责人还特别提到，北京市这次下放干部不是层层下放，而是一下子放到底。
    下面是这位负责人的谈话。
    市的负责干部亲自领导这一工作，严格批判部分单位负责人想对干部这也照顾那也照顾的错误想法
    北京市下放干部参加体力劳动的工作是从8月中旬开始的。目前，这一工作已在政府机关、党群系统、工业、建筑业、农场、商业、事业、高等学校等各个方面展开。绝大多数单位的领导干部在了解了这一工作的重大意义后，决心很大，都制定了抽调干部参加劳动生产的初步方案，一般都决定抽调30％到50％，有的单位高达70％以上。在广大的工作人员中沸腾着高涨的社会主义革命热情，纷纷要求第一批下乡参加劳动。
    中共北京市委和市人民委员会对这次抽调干部到农村参加生产下了最大的决心，当市委和市人民委员会会议作出决定后，市委和市人民委员会很多负责同志都亲自领导这一工作。北京市人民委员会在所属单位抽调工作开始前，首先召开了各局长和各区长的会议，打通领导干部思想。会上除绝大多数人拥护这一措施外，也有人提出了一些问题，如强调要“照顾”干部等等。这种思想受到了严格的批判。会议指出政府机关的组织和干部作风，必须能够密切联系劳动群众，必须适应社会主义建设的需要，这次下去就是要参加劳动生产，在机关的一套生活、政治待遇必须改变，如照顾这又照顾那，干部就根本不能抽调。要求各单位能抽多少就抽多少，能下多少就下多少，抽调的不但是一般干部，也要抽些主要干部作骨干。会上，大家结合本单位几年来人浮于事、工作效率不高和最近整风和反右派斗争中暴露出来的问题，进一步进行了讨论，较深刻地认识了这一革命措施的重要意义，大家除表示决心从本单位抽调干部下乡参加劳动生产外，还表示自己愿意先到农村去参加生产。市的领导方面也明确提出：这一工作作得好坏，决心大不大，是对每个领导干部是否有决心转变作风、克服官僚主义的重要的考验。
    会议结束后，几位副市长和秘书长分了工，紧紧地抓住汇报和检查，发现问题及时解决，对劲头不大的单位就找领导干部谈话，帮助解决思想问题。粮食局在一位副市长的具体帮助下，经过周密的研究，制定出从现有人员中抽调62％的人参加劳动的方案。由于市一级领导干部决心大，亲自动手，抓得紧，局一级的领导干部也就下了决心。商业局除了本身抽调出54.8％的干部下放外，还从所属各公司抽调出了65.7％的管理人员下放生产，有三个公司的经理也抽调出来参加了生产。
    要彻底解决干部的思想问题，解决的办法是让大家“摆问题，提困难”，对错误的思想通过辩论加以批判，对合理的要求尽可能帮助解决
    领导干部下决心以后，就要很好地在干部中作思想工作，而且必须作深作透。这一工作是分两个阶段进行的。第一阶段是进行一般的思想动员，主要是普遍学习彭真市长8月初在北京市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上的讲话。彭真市长在那次讲话中指出：为了从根本上克服官僚主义，改变工作作风，加强同劳动群众的密切联系，更好地锻炼培养干部，贯彻增产节约、勤俭建国的方针，在社会上树立劳动光荣勤俭节约的风气，必须在各机关和事业企业单位内抽调30％到50％的工作人员较长期地参加体力劳动。根据这个指示，各单位结合本单位机构臃肿、人浮于事、工作效率不高、脱离群众脱离实际等具体情况，经过反复学习讨论后，绝大多数的工作人员表示拥护这一方针，有一些人向领导上写保证书、申请书，要求第一批去参加体力劳动。
    这时，虽然绝大多数人表示拥护这一方针，并有少数人报名响应，但具体的思想问题还没有暴露出来。为了把思想工作作深作透，我们向各单位提出了深、透的标准，即下放干部在下去前，要彻底地解决思想问题，使之自觉地愉快地走向生产岗位，并使所有的工作人员在下放问题上都有充分的思想准备，以便领导上一旦决定下放时都能愉快地走上劳动战线。
    为了达到以上标准，思想工作进入了第二个阶段——具体深入地解决思想问题的阶段。首先让大家“摆问题，提困难”，让各种各样的问题暴露出来。一般来说有以下情况：有的知识分子干部认为叫他们参加劳动生产是“大材小用”，是“浪费人材”，怕影响自己的业务学习和前途。他们怕吃苦，怕农民不卫生，留恋城市生活。有的也提出了参加劳动后家庭生活等各方面的一些困难。
    为了解决这些问题，采取了以下几种方法：一、以科、室为单位针对以上问题进行辩论，把一些共同性的问题交大家普遍讨论，如知识分子参加劳动是否“大材小用”？劳动是否光荣，劳动人民是否脏？如何根本改变机关内人浮于事的状况等；二、组织干部特别是从小生活在城市没有参加过劳动的知识分子，到农业生产合作社参观；三、对于干部提出的生活上一些合理而又可能解决的困难问题，尽可能帮助解决。
    经过辩论、参观，很多错误认识受到了批判，大家共同提高了认识。很多干部提出：未经过根本改造的知识分子，四体不勤，五谷不分，没有一点生产知识，不熟悉工农劳动群众，在这种情况下，如果决心要做一个社会主义国家的干部，就必须到基层生产单位去参加体力劳动，这是知识分子进行自我改造的最根本的方法，决不是什么“大材小用”。很多老干部也认识到，自己虽然经过考验，但解放八年来长期呆在城市的机关里，和劳动群众逐渐疏远了，因此有必要通过参加体力劳动加强和群众的联系。有些认为参加劳动是“丢人”，说“农民脏”和有怕吃苦等思想的人，经过讨论后，也都认识到这是一种可耻的资产阶级思想，同一个共产党员、共青团员和国家机关的革命干部的思想是不相容的。有些人在参观了农业生产合作社以后，也看到社会主义的新农村有广阔的发展前途，它迫切需要大批的干部去进行建设。因此大家都下定了决心，要过好社会主义革命这一关。
    经过以上工作，广大的工作人员对参加劳动的意义就有了比较具体的了解，纷纷向领导上提出第一批下放的要求。在这一基础上批准下放名单。
    被确定留在机关的干部，根据人员减少以后的情况，也用“以一当二”的精神，积极担负起全部工作任务。他们同下放参加生产的干部纷纷提出了竞赛的口号。下放的人员表示要在劳动战线和思想战线上都得到丰收，留在机关的干部表示要进一步联系群众，用克勤克俭的精神作好机关工作。
    干部下决心参加劳动生产，是经过了激烈的思想斗争的。抽调大批干部参加劳动生产是改进工作、锻炼和培养干部的一项革命措施，对一个人的思想来说也是一个巨大的变革，是一次深刻的革命。在去和不去的问题上很多干部都考虑到：自己要不要为社会主义奋斗到底？参加革命是不是有条件？自己如何跟上时代前进？为了回答这些问题，不少人彻夜不眠，思想斗争极其激烈。经过这种思想斗争，大大提高了社会主义觉悟，对参加生产才下了决心。
    干部下决心后，几乎所有有家庭的干部都自动召开了家庭会议。家庭会议上除多数的家庭表示支持外，也有的家庭认为参加劳动“丢人”，并提出各种各样家庭生活上的困难问题来。这对干部所下的决心是第一个严重的考验，思想斗争这时更较前剧烈。经过对家属的说服动员和生活上的妥善安排，才度过了“第一关”。
    为了巩固下放干部的情绪，在干部下放的时候，各部门都举行了欢送会；在他们下去以后，很多单位的负责人还亲自去看望他们，了解他们的困难和要求，有的单位还派干部访问他们的家属，帮助具体解决一些生活上的困难问题。这些工作对下放干部安心生产有很大作用。
    必须作好具体的组织工作，那些人去劳动，那些人留机关，要根据加强机关工作和锻炼改造干部兼顾的原则考虑决定
    在作好思想工作的同时，还必须认真作好具体的组织工作。那些人留在机关工作，那些人下放生产，北京市是根据加强机关工作和锻炼改造干部二者不能偏废的精神考虑决定的。对于既不能工作又不能参加劳动生产的年老体弱的干部，可以采用退休、退职、长期休养的办法加以处理。所有有下放干部的单位，在干部下放前，必须按照全市的统一安排和有关的农业生产合作社具体进行联系，向他们介绍下放干部的情况，具体安排下放干部的吃、住等问题。同时，也向下放干部介绍他们将要去的农业生产合作社的情况，讲明下去后要服从农业生产合作社的领导，严格遵守劳动纪律。在农业生产合作社内也应该召开社员大会，向他们讲清楚下放干部的意义，以免引起一些不必要的误会。
    现在，绝大多数的下放干部，在农村中都表现得很好，他们和农民同吃、同住、同劳动，劳动热情很高，许多人虽然手上磨了泡，肩膀压得红肿肿的，但劳动情绪很高。粮食局的一个党员干部一下去就干重活，十天内农业社就给他记了一百一十个工分。现在有些人已开始制定明年的生产计划。一般下去一月左右的干部已大大改变了在机关的模样，每个人的脸都黑里透红，和群众的关系也亲如家人。特别是一些有群众工作经验的老干部，他们除积极劳动生产外，有空就和老乡在一起聊天，群众的什么活都抢着干。丰台区公安分局的干部孙世奎下工后就给房东打水、扫院子、洗菜、抱孩子，房东老太太亲热地称他为儿子。群众对下放干部的反映很好，都说：这些人个个都是好样的，将来可当个好干部。
    下放干部最大的收获是：知道了一粒粮食一个菜叶子都来之不易，真正认识了劳动对创造物质财富的意义，也都注意节约了。一个参加菜田生产的女干部有一次回家，看到家里吃白菜只吃心，把很多菜叶都抛掉，她就感到很心痛，和家里的人说：“你们不知道种棵白菜多不容易啊！”另一个收获是普遍提高了阶级觉悟，阶级观点比在机关里明确、具体多了。农村中富农、中农、贫农对很多问题的看法有着显然的不同，他们对下放干部的态度也各不一样。如有个干部生产时不小心弄破了手，一个贫农老太太就把自己的衣服撕破给这个干部包扎，而富农对干部冷言冷语。这些具体事实对干部的教育作用很大。现在他们普遍要求学习党在农村的各种政策。
    干部下放后，社会风气也引起了变化：农村中考不上学校参加农业生产的高小、中学毕业生安心生产了；城内劳动就业登记过去从来没有要求到农村生产的，现在开始有人登记要求到农村去生产了。
    下放的干部如何安心地长期从事农业生产，在思想感情、生活习惯上如何和群众打成一片，还需要一段艰苦的锻炼过程。另外，对下放的干部，如何进行管理教育，如何规定他们的生产定额等很多具体问题，今后还需进一步研究解决。
