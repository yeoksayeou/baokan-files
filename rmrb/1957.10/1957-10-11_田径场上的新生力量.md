New Strength on the Track and Field
　　By our reporters Ai Tiemin and Shi Yuzhong

At this National Track and Field Meet, the athletes from each team have created many excellent results. This is gratifying, but even more gratifying is the emergence of many outstanding new talents at this meet. In particular, many new talents have emerged among the female athletes.

In the women's Group A high jump, Kong Lingrong jumped over 1.54 meters and defeated the master athlete Fu Xueyan to win second place. This height exceeds the standard for China's first-class athletes and is only 4 centimeters short of the 1.58-meter standard for China's master athletes. Those who don't know her would surely think she is a tall, well-trained veteran. But in fact, she is only a 17-year-old middle school student from Beijing who is 1.62 meters tall. During the decades of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang, only Wu Shusen was able to jump over 1.40 meters. But in this women's Group B high jump competition, Yang Meiru from the Beijing team, who won first place, jumped over 1.46 meters, reaching the level of a second-class athlete. This 15-year-old girl is 1.73 meters tall and has excellent jumping ability. Insiders believe she is a very promising athlete. The other five female athletes who jumped with her also exceeded 1.43 meters. Ke Xihua from the Shanghai team is not very tall, but she can run and jump. This time she won the women's Group B 100-meter and long jump championships. Her long jump record reached 5.34 meters, approaching the national record. In the women's Group B long jump, there were also three people who reached over 5 meters. Before liberation, only one overseas Chinese, Deng Yinjiao, jumped over 5 meters. Today, it seems that jumping 5 meters is already a common thing.

In the past few days of competition, there have also been quite a few excellent newcomers emerging among the male athletes. Before liberation, Lou Wen'ao ran 10,000 meters in 32 minutes and 47 seconds, causing a sensation. What's so great about this record? In this men's Group B 10,000-meter competition, the results of Zhao Baorong, a 21-year-old fitter from Tianjin, Huang Zhiyong from the Liberation Army team, and Huo Tianshun from the Henan team all exceeded Lou Wen'ao's record. The top three in the men's Group B triple jump all jumped over 134 meters, reaching the standard for first-class athletes. The achievements of the new forces in the men's high jump are also changing with each passing day. Before liberation, it was very difficult for a man to reach 1.82 meters in the high jump, but this time Yao Shanzhou and Lu Changde, who participated in the men's Group B high jump, easily jumped over 1.83 meters.

New strength in track and field is constantly growing. Many of these athletes are newcomers and have not participated in many competitions. Many of them are participating in such a large-scale sports meet for the first time. However, how can people not feel excited that they have achieved such good results in their first try!

Among the newcomers participating in this sports meet, 48 are still young athletes under the age of eighteen, and some are still wearing red scarves. In the past, they all participated in juvenile sports meets. This time, because there is no juvenile group, they have to compete with adults. However, these little brothers and sisters are not weak at all. They still created gratifying results in the competition. For example, Kong Lingrong and Yang Meiru both achieved very good results. Meng Xiuying, Wang Qinglan, and Zhao Xiuyu from the Shandong team are all very excellent young female athletes. This time, they won gold medals in the women's Group B 200, 400, and 800-meter races respectively, and their results reached the standard for second-class athletes. Hu Zurong, 15, is a junior high school student from Shanghai who only started practicing pole vaulting last year. At such a young age, he has jumped over 3.60 meters. This time he jumped 3.50 meters, which reached the level of a second-class athlete.

From this sports meet, people have clearly seen that the new generation of newcomers has brought even more brilliant hope to the future of China's sports.

　　田径场上的新生力量
    本报记者　艾铁民　施毓忠
    在这次全国田径运动会上，各代表队的健将们创造出不少优异的成绩。这是令人可喜的事，但是更令人可喜的是，在这次运动会上涌现出很多优秀的新生力量。特别是女运动员中出现了不少新的好手。
    在女子甲组跳高中，孔令蓉跳过了一公尺五十四并战胜运动健将傅雪雁获得第二名。这个高度超过了我国一级运动员的标准，同我国运动健将一公尺五十八公分的标准，只差四公分。不知道她的人，一定以为她是身材高大、锻炼有素的宿将。岂不知，她今年才是一个十七岁、身高一公尺六二的北京中学生。在国民党反动统治几十年期间，女子能跳过一公尺四十的只有吴树森一人。但在这次女子乙组跳高比赛中获得第一名的北京队杨美如就跳过了一公尺四十六公分，达到二级运动员的水准。这位十五岁的小姑娘，身高一公尺七十三公分，弹跳力很好，内行们都认为她是很有前途的一个运动员。跟她同时跳的其他五个女运动员也都超过了一公尺四十三公分。上海队柯细华个子不大，但能跑能跳，这次她连获女子乙组一百公尺和急行跳远的冠军。她的跳远纪录达到了五公尺三十四公分，接近了全国最高纪录。在女子乙组跳远中达到五公尺以上的还有三个人。解放前女子跳远只有一个华侨邓银娇跳过了五公尺。今天看来，跳五公尺这已经是一件平常的事了。
    在几天的比赛中，男运动员里涌现出的优秀的新手为数也不少。解放前有个楼文敖一万公尺跑了三十二分四十七秒，轰动一时。这个纪录有什么了不起呢？在这次男子乙组一万公尺比赛中，天津市二十一岁的钳工赵宝荣、解放军队的黄志勇和河南队的霍天顺三人的成绩都超过楼文敖的纪录。男子乙组三级跳远前三名都跳过了三十四公尺达到一级运动员的标准。男子跳高中新生力量的成绩也日新月异。解放前，男子跳高达到一公尺八十二公分是很不容易的，而这次参加男子乙组跳高的姚善周和吕常德很轻松的就跳过了一公尺八十三公分。
    田径运动中的新生力量在不断成长。这些运动员中不少是初学乍练，参加比赛的次数也不多，很多人是第一次参加这样大规模的运动会。可是，他们能在初试身手时，就取得了这样好的成绩，怎能不令人感到兴奋呢！
    参加这次运动会的新手中，有四十八人还是不满十八岁的少年选手，有的还戴着红领巾呢。他们过去都是参加少年运动会的，这次因为没有少年组，所以他们只好同成年人一起争胜了。可是这些小弟弟和小妹妹丝毫不弱，他们在比赛中还是同样地创造了可喜的成绩。如孔令蓉和杨美如都取得了很好的成绩，山东队的孟秀英、王庆兰和赵秀玉她们都是很优秀的少年女运动员，这次他们分别在女子乙组二百、四百和八百公尺比赛中，夺得了金牌，成绩并达到二级运动员标准。十五岁的胡祖荣是一个上海初中学生，去年才开始练撑竿跳高。小小的年纪就曾跳过了三公尺六十。这次他跳了三公尺五十，这个成绩达到二级运动员水平。
    从这次运动会上，人们已经清楚地看到，后一辈的新手给我国体育运动事业的前途带来了更加光辉的希望。
