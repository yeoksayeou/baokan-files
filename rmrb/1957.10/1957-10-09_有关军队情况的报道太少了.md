    There Are Too Few Reports About the Military
    Recently, I have felt that there are very few reports in the newspapers about our Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army. Just like the broad masses of the people, I constantly cherish our Liberation Army and Volunteer Army in my heart and would very much like to know about their situation in terms of defending the motherland, safeguarding world peace, and their lives; at the same time, our army has the excellent tradition of overcoming all difficulties, and every victorious deed of theirs, through newspaper reports, often becomes the driving force for us to overcome difficulties and encourages our confidence. I request that newspapers appropriately increase reports about the work and life of our army.　Lǐ Déqí, Xiangtan City, Hunan Province

    有关军队情况的报道太少了
    近来我感到在报纸上很少读到有关我们中国人民解放军和志愿军的报道。正和广大的人民群众一样，我对我们的解放军与志愿军是时刻怀念在心，很想知道他们在为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平以及生活等方面的情况；同时，我们的军队有战胜一切困难的优良传统，他们每一个胜利的事迹，通过报刊的报道，往往变成了我们战胜困难的动力，鼓舞我们的信心。我要求报纸适当地增加一些有关我们军队的工作和生活情况的报道。　湖南省湘潭市　李德祺
