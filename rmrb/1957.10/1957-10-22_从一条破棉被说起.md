Starting with a Ragged Comforter

The ragged comforter held by the three people in the first picture below is the only one the Huang Weixing family of four had before liberation.

Dear readers! Perhaps you are not very familiar with the impoverished lives of the vast number of working peasants before liberation? Maybe you know a little, but have forgotten. Then, please listen to me tell you this story about the ragged comforter!

Old peasant Huang Weixing is fifty-nine years old this year and was originally from Pujiang County. Fifty years ago, because his family was poor and his parents couldn't support him, he had to wander to Lanxi with his fellow villagers, helping landlords and rich peasants graze cattle in Datang Township, and later became a junior farmhand. This subhuman life tormented him for twenty years.

After thirty, Huang Weixing barely started a family. However, despite the couple's hard work all year round, they could still only get "three months of rice soup and nine months of wild vegetables." Once, when the early rice was about to be harvested, his family had no grain left. He had no choice but to borrow a hundred catties of grain from the landlord; in less than a month, the landlord demanded a hundred and fifty catties. This situation occurred almost every year. In his forty years of working as a farmhand, he borrowed high-interest loans from the landlord more than four hundred times.

The pain and suffering he experienced in half a century are endless to tell. One year, his son didn't even have a piece of rag left on his body. His wife went to the mountains to chop firewood and found the corpse of a child (of unknown family) buried at the foot of the mountain, dug up and eaten by a dog, leaving only a piece of ragged clothing. She took the ragged clothing back, washed it clean, and gave it to her son to wear. His family was so poor that even a piece of ragged clothing worn by a dead person was their most precious property. As for a comforter, it was even more of a luxury for his family. He had thought about it for many years but still couldn't afford it. Huang Yongxiang, a young neighbor who knew his situation well, gave him one of the two comforters he had received when he separated from his family.

It was this comforter that Huang Weixing's family of four used for twenty years.

After liberation, Huang Weixing, like other working peasants, was liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party, was allocated land and houses, and his life began to change. In 1955, his family joined the Datang Agricultural Cooperative, and from then on, they embarked on an increasingly happy path. Now his family raises two fat pigs and a flock of hens; they have made new comforters, and everyone in the family wears new clothes; they eat white rice three meals a day... The days of "three months of rice soup and nine months of wild vegetables" are gone forever with the elimination of the old system.

He calculated that this year his family, in addition to receiving enough rations, will also have an income of about four hundred yuan. Therefore, he plans to use this, along with last year's savings, to build three new houses, and also prepare to get wives for his two sons...

This is the change in Huang Weixing's family, and it is also the change in thousands upon thousands of working peasants.

In 1954, he returned to his hometown after demobilization during the cooperative movement and participated in rural socialist construction. Now, he is the deputy secretary of the CCP Datang Township Branch and the deputy director of the Datang Agricultural Cooperative. He is now in his forties. This is Comrade Huang Yongxiang (left) talking with Huang Weixing and his two sons about the changes in their lives over the past twenty years.

### 从一条破棉被说起

    从一条破棉被说起
    下面第一张图片上三个人拿着的一条破棉被，是解放前农民黄为兴一家四口仅有的一条破棉被。
    亲爱的读者！你也许对解放前广大劳动农民的贫困生活不很熟悉吧？也许，你约略知道一些，可是淡忘了。那末，请听我讲一讲这个关于破棉被的故事吧！
    老农民黄为兴今年五十九岁，原是浦江县人。五十年前，因为家里贫苦，父母养不活他，他只好跟着乡亲流浪到兰溪，在大塘乡帮着地主、富农放牛，后来又成了小长工。这种牛马不如的生活煎熬了他二十年。
    过了三十岁，黄为兴勉强成了家。但是，夫妻俩终年勤劳，依然只能换来“三个月米汤，九个月野菜”。有一次，早稻快要收割，而他家里却粒米无存了。不得已，他去向地主借了一百斤谷子；不到一个月，地主却要去了一百五十斤。这种情形，差不多年年都有。四十年的长工生活中，他向地主所借的高利贷超过了四百次。
    在半个世纪里他所经历的痛苦、辛酸是诉说不完的。有一年，他儿子身上连破布也不剩一块了，他的妻子到山上去砍柴，发现埋葬在山脚边的、不知哪一家的一个孩子的尸体，被狗扒出来吃掉了，只剩下一件破衣服。她把那件破衣服拿回来，洗净了，给自己的儿子穿。他的家是这样穷苦，就连一件死人穿过的破衣服也是最宝贵的财产；至于棉被，在他一家说来更是一种奢望，想了许多年也还是买不起。他的一个青年乡邻黄永祥，深知他的境况，因此把自己分家的时候所分得的两条棉被送了他一条。
    就是这一条棉被，黄为兴一家四口盖了二十年。
    解放后，黄为兴和其他劳动农民一样，在共产党领导下翻了身，分到了土地，也分到了房屋，生活开始改变了。1955年，他一家参加了大塘农业合作社，从此就走上了愈来愈好的幸福的道路。现在他家里养了两口肥猪和一群母鸡；做了新棉被，一家人都穿上了新衣服；每天三餐都是白米饭……。“三个月米汤，九个月野菜”的日子，伴随着旧制度的消灭而一去不复返了。
    他自己算了一笔账，今年他一家除了可以分到足够的口粮以外，还有四百元左右的收入。因此他准备连同去年的积蓄，用来修造三间新房，还准备为两个儿子娶媳妇……。
    这是黄为兴一家的变化，也是千千万万劳动农民的变化。
