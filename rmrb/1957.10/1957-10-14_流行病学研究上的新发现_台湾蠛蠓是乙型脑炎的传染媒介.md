Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 11th - Scientists at the Fujian Provincial Institute of Epidemiology have discovered that Taiwanese biting midges are vectors for transmitting Japanese encephalitis. They have also discovered the Japanese encephalitis virus in their blood. These two findings are the latest domestic and international discoveries in the study of Japanese encephalitis epidemiology.

The team, led by Wu Jiaoru, Deputy Director of the Fujian Provincial Institute of Epidemiology and a microbiology expert, has conducted a series of investigations and studies on Japanese encephalitis in Longxi County for many years. Since 1955, they have successively isolated four strains of the Japanese encephalitis virus from Taiwanese biting midges (small, black, mosquito-like biting insects, only about one-third the size of a mosquito), and one strain of the virus from cattle blood. After two years of chick embryo culture, animal inoculation experiments, and virological identification, it has been confirmed that Taiwanese biting midges are vectors for transmitting Japanese encephalitis, and that infected yellow cattle are also a source of infection for Japanese encephalitis. They have also discovered that applying potassium sulfide solution to the skin is remarkably effective in preventing bites from Taiwanese biting midges, with one application lasting for more than ten hours. This method is both economical and harmless to the human body.

    流行病学研究上的新发现
    台湾蠛蠓是乙型脑炎的传染媒介
    新华社福州11日电　福建省流行病学研究所的科学家们，发现台湾蠛蠓是传播乙型脑炎的传染媒介。他们还从血中发现乙型脑炎的病毒。这两项是目前国内外在研究乙型脑炎流行病学方面的最新发现。
    由福建省流行病学研究所副所长、微生物学专家吴皎如等组成的小组，连年来在龙溪县对乙型脑炎进行一系列的调查研究。他们从1955年起先后在台湾蠛蠓（像蚊子的叮人小飞虫，只有蚊子三分之一大，黑色）体内分离出乙型脑炎病毒四株，从牛血中分离出病毒一株。经过两年来用鸡胚培养和动物接种试验以及病毒学鉴定，证实了台湾蠛蠓是传播乙型脑炎的传染媒介，证实了染毒的黄牛也是乙型脑炎的传染源。他们还研究出硫化钾溶液敷在皮肤上，对防御台湾蠛蠓的叮咬有奇效，药力一次可以维持十小时以上，既经济且对人体无害。
