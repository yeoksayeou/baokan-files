    Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Nanjing Receive Artificial Satellite Signals
    Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: Radio signals from the first artificial Earth satellite launched by the Soviet Union have been received three times by the radio station of the Shanghai Radio Management Bureau on the 6th. The times were: 9:56 to 10:04, 11:43 to 11:48, and 12:56 to 13:01 (all Beijing time).
    At a symposium held yesterday by the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee to welcome the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation, Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, warmly congratulated Comrade Aristov, head of the delegation, on the successful launch of the artificial satellite by the Soviet Union. Aristov said, "This shows the strength and invincibility of the socialist camp. In the future, we will certainly be able to fly to Mars and to the Moon."
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 6th: According to TASS, the artificial Earth satellite launched by the Soviet Union appeared over Guangzhou at 17:41 Moscow time (22:41 Beijing time) on the 5th. At that time, the sky over Guangzhou was dark and cloudy, so people were unable to see the artificial satellite at that time.
    The Southern Daily radio station in Guangzhou clearly received the continuous signals emitted by the radio transmitter of this artificial satellite from 19:23 to 19:42 and from 20:55 to 21:18 Guangzhou time today.
    This morning, when Yin Linping, Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, was seeing off the government delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria at the airport, he congratulated Mr. Orlov, the Soviet Consul in Guangzhou, as soon as he saw him. Orlov said, "This is a gift from Soviet scholars to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution." Scientists in Guangzhou unanimously celebrated this achievement. Huang Youmou, director of the Guangzhou branch of the Chinese Physical Society and acting president of South China Normal College, believes that this is a brilliant victory for Soviet science.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 6th: After receiving the news of the first artificial Earth satellite launched by the Soviet Union on the night of the 5th, scientific workers at the Zijinshan Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences sacrificed their weekends and holidays, climbed Zijin Mountain outside Nanjing city overnight to conduct research, and stayed by radios and teleprinters to listen to broadcasts from Moscow and signals from the artificial satellite, and tried to observe it with telescopes before dawn.

    上海广州南京收听人造卫星讯号
    新华社6日电　苏联发射的第一颗人造地球卫星上的无线电讯号，上海无线电管理处的电台已经在6日三次收听到。时间为：九点五十六分到十点四分，十一点四十三分到四十八分，十二点五十六分到十三点零一分（均北京时间）。
    上海市副市长曹荻秋昨天在上海市人民委员会举行的欢迎苏联最高苏维埃代表团的座谈会上，向阿里斯托夫团长热烈祝贺苏联发射人造卫星成功。阿里斯托夫说：“这说明了社会主义阵营力量的强大和不可战胜。以后我们一定能飞向火星、飞向月球。”
    据新华社广州6日电　据塔斯社宣布，苏联发射的人造地球卫星在5日莫斯科时间十七点四十一分（即北京时间二十二时四十一分）出现在广州上空。在这个时间内，广州天空很暗，并且多云，所以人们在当时没有能够看到这颗人造卫星。
    广州的南方日报电台在今天广州时间十九点二十三分到十九点四十二分和二十点五十五分到二十一点十八分，清晰地收听到这颗人造卫星用无线电发射机发出的连续信号。
    广东省副省长尹林平今晨在机场上欢送保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团的时候，一见到苏联驻广州领事鄂洛夫就向他表示祝贺。鄂洛夫说：“这是苏联学者们向十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念的献礼。”广州的科学家们一致庆贺这一成就。中国物理学会广州分会理事、华南师范学院代理院长黄友谋认为这是苏维埃科学的辉煌胜利。
    据新华社南京6日电　中国科学院紫金山天文台的科学工作者，5日夜得到苏联发射的第一个人造地球卫星的消息后，牺牲周末和假期，连夜出南京城攀登紫金山进行研究，分别守在收音机和收报机旁，收听莫斯科广播和人造卫星上的讯号，黎明前并用望远镜试行观测。
