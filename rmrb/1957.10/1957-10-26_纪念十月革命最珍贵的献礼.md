The October Revolution opened a new era for the Soviet people and human history, illuminating the path for the complete liberation of the Chinese and all the world's working people. It encouraged all oppressed classes and nations to bravely and confidently strive for their own liberation, for independence and freedom, and for a happy and peaceful life, constantly moving from victory to new victory. On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, the working people of the world are paying their highest respects, deep gratitude, and warm congratulations to the Soviet Party, government, and people, the great lighthouse illuminating the path to the liberation of all mankind.

The Soviet people have always had the deepest friendship with the Chinese people, for forty years as one. The selfless assistance that the Chinese people have received from the Soviet Union is countless and endless. Especially after the victory of the Chinese revolution, the Soviet government and people have continuously assisted us in building socialism with enormous economic and technological strength. In the fields of science, technology, and culture alone, since liberation, a large number of outstanding Soviet scientists and technicians have left their own happy families and beautiful homeland to come to our country to help us build socialism. The total number of Chinese personnel sent to the Soviet Union to study science and technology is far above six thousand. The Soviet Union's massive technical assistance to us has a decisive role and incomparably significant meaning for the successful completion of our socialist construction.

Soviet medicine, like other natural sciences in the Soviet Union, is the most advanced in the world. In the Soviet Union, many infectious diseases, such as plague, smallpox, typhus, relapsing fever, pappataci fever, kala-azar, malaria, diphtheria, tetanus, etc., were completely or basically eliminated long ago. The health level of the Soviet people has long surpassed that of other countries. In the past few years, our country has also completely eliminated cholera and human plague, and basically eliminated diseases such as smallpox, relapsing fever, and typhus. Other acute infectious diseases such as diphtheria, typhoid fever, syphilis, gonorrhea, puerperal fever, and tetanus are also in the process of rapid elimination. Significant progress has also been made in the prevention and treatment of natural focal diseases, occupational diseases, tuberculosis, and leprosy. In order to eliminate parasitic diseases that seriously endanger people's health within a limited time, such as schistosomiasis, malaria, kala-azar, filariasis, and hookworm disease, the comprehensive prevention and treatment measures we have taken are on a scale that no capitalist country can accomplish, let alone the reactionary rule of the old society. Similarly, the development of industrial and mining hygiene, urban hygiene, rural hygiene, and maternal and child hygiene in New China has also been very rapid. The people's living and health standards have continuously improved, and morbidity and mortality rates have generally decreased. But these achievements are inseparable from our learning from the Soviet Union and the selfless assistance of the Soviet people.

Soviet medicine is guided by Pavlov's theory. Since liberation, a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union has been set off throughout the country, and medical and health workers across the country have widely learned advanced Soviet medicine, especially Pavlov's theory. Relevant medical personnel across the country have learned and applied advanced Soviet methods of painless childbirth, protective medical systems, and comprehensive prevention and treatment measures necessary for eliminating diseases. This is an epoch-making transformation in the history of medicine in our country; it has played a great role in our clinical teaching research and preventive health work, and has achieved many achievements. These achievements are precious good news and commemorative gifts from medical workers in our country when celebrating the 40th anniversary of the great October Revolution.

In 1952, the Soviet people, through the Soviet Red Cross Society, generously and enthusiastically helped our country and established the Soviet Red Cross Hospital in Beijing, the capital of our country. It trained medical cadres for our country and treated many difficult and complicated diseases, once again demonstrating a high degree of internationalism and a high degree of revolutionary humanitarianism.

All medical equipment, medicines, utensils, etc. in the hospital are the latest, excellent, and precious products donated by the Soviet Union. Over the past five years, 126 Soviet experts have come to work in the hospital. Their rich technical experience, noble qualities, and excellent style have left an unforgettable impression on the Chinese people.

On March 19 this year, the Soviet government and people generously and selflessly transferred all the property and equipment of the Soviet Red Cross Hospital to our country unconditionally. Just like the current name of the hospital – the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital – the people of China and the Soviet Union have an unbreakable and profound friendship. Now, the hospital is developing and will undertake more and greater tasks. We assure our great Soviet friends: with your deep and great friendship with us, and with the care and wise leadership of our Party, we will definitely overcome all difficulties and complete the glorious tasks given to us by the Soviet and Chinese people as soon as possible.

We will unswervingly continue to learn from the Soviet Union, learn the characteristics and features of Soviet medicine, learn the Soviet comrades' spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, and learn the high degree of organized, planned, and led collectivism, internationalism, and revolutionary humanitarianism that it embodies. Learning how to inherit and develop this fine traditional style and spirit is a work of great significance that must be guaranteed to be implemented in our commemoration of the great October Revolution.

All scientific research in the Soviet Union is to continuously improve the living standards of the working people, improve their health, and serve the peaceful and happy cause of all mankind. The Soviet Union was the first country in the world to successfully use atomic energy for the peaceful and happy cause of mankind, and established the world's first nuclear power plant and the first nuclear-powered icebreaker. At the same time, in order to defend world peace, the Soviet Union's technological achievements in atomic and hydrogen weapons have long reached the most advanced levels. Recently, outstanding Soviet scientists, following the amazing achievements of intercontinental ballistic missiles, successfully launched the first artificial earth satellite. We express our infinite excitement, encouragement, admiration, and gratitude for the Soviet Union's brilliant achievements in science and technology, for the consistent peace policy it has pursued, and for the highest degree of humanitarianism it embodies.

The 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution coincides with the great victory of our people's struggle against the Rightists. The struggle against the Rightists is for building socialism and protecting socialism. Therefore, it is of great political significance for us to further and thoroughly carry out the struggle against the Rightists. Since liberation, the vast majority of intellectuals have accepted the education of the Party and have been transformed, and under the wise leadership of the Party, they have stood in the ranks of the people, loyally and honestly serving the people and serving the socialist construction of the motherland. In the past eight years, because we have participated in the construction of the motherland, we have personally witnessed the earth-shattering great construction cause in the country and felt honored, happy, and proud. However, the Rightists have ulterior motives, cannot see the brilliant achievements of construction since liberation, and use the opportunity of the Party's rectification to frantically attack the Party, use double-dealing tactics to sow discord, negate all achievements, and attempt to usurp the leadership of the Party and pull the people's revolutionary cause from the socialist road back to the dying capitalist road. This vicious, organized, planned, and programmatic counter-revolutionary conspiracy was promptly exposed and forcefully countered by the people of China. In the struggle against the Rightists, the vast majority of medical workers across the country, together with the people of China, stood firm on the proletarian position, eliminated sentimentalism, fought resolutely with the Rightists to the end, tempered themselves, and improved their political consciousness. The vast majority of medical workers in our country, together with all the Chinese people, are determined to unite more closely around the Communist Party, learn from the Soviet Union more earnestly and diligently, thoroughly transform themselves, so that every one of our medical workers becomes a powerful member of the socialist red health team, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and forever following the Communist Party. This is the most meaningful action and the most precious gift for us to commemorate the great festival of the October Socialist Revolution.

    纪念十月革命最珍贵的献礼
    中苏友谊医院院长　钟惠澜
    十月革命为苏联人民和人类历史开辟了一个崭新的时代，照亮了中国和全世界劳动人民彻底解放自己的道路，鼓舞着一切被压迫阶级和被压迫民族勇敢地满怀信心地为了解放自己，为了求得独立自由和为了美满幸福的和平生活而努力奋斗，不断地从胜利走向新的胜利。在十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念前夕，全世界劳动人民都以无比兴奋的心情向照耀全世界解放全人类前进的伟大灯塔——苏联的党、政府和人民致以崇高的敬意，深切的感谢和热烈的祝贺。
    苏联人民一向对中国人民有着最深厚的友谊，四十年如一日。中国人民得到苏联的无私帮助是数不尽说不完的。特别是在中国革命胜利之后，苏联政府和人民不断地以庞大的经济和技术力量帮助我们建设社会主义。仅在科学技术文化事业方面，解放以来，就有大量的苏联优秀科学技术人员远离他们自己幸福的家庭和美丽的祖国，来到我国帮助我们建设社会主义。我国派到苏联学习科学技术的人员总数，远在六千名以上。苏联给我们这样庞大的技术援助，对我国社会主义建设的胜利完成是具有决定性的作用和无比重大的意义的。
    苏联医学如同苏联的其他自然科学一样，是世界上最先进的。在苏联，许多的传染疾病，如鼠疫、天花、斑疹伤寒、回归热、白蛉热、黑热病、疟疾、白喉、破伤风等，都很早就完全消灭或基本消灭了。苏联人民的健康水平早已超过世界各国。几年来，我国也已完全消灭了霍乱和人间鼠疫，基本消灭了天花、回归热、斑疹伤寒等疾病。其他急性传染病如白喉、伤寒、梅毒、淋病、产褥热、破伤风等，也正处在迅速消灭的过程中。自然疫源性疾病、工矿职业病、结核和麻疯等的防治工作，也已经取得显著成绩。为了限期消灭危害人民健康很严重的寄生虫病，如血吸虫病、疟疾、黑热病、丝虫病、钩虫病等，我们所采取的综合性防治措施，其规模之大，绝非任何资本主义国家所能办到，更非旧社会反动统治所能办到的。同样的，新中国的工矿卫生、城市卫生、农村卫生和妇幼卫生的发展也非常迅速。人民的生活和健康水平不断地有了提高，发病率和死亡率普遍地降低。但这些成就都是同我们学习苏联和苏联人民无私的帮助分不开的。
    苏联医学是以巴甫洛夫学说为指导思想的。解放以来，全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，全国医药卫生工作者广泛地学习了苏联先进医学，特别是巴甫洛夫学说。全国有关的医务人员都学习了和应用了苏联先进的无痛分娩法、保护性医疗制度和消灭疾病所必须的综合性防治措施。这在我国医学史上是一个划时代的转变；对我国的临床教学研究和预防的卫生工作起了很大作用，取得了不少成就，这些成就是我国医务工作者在庆祝伟大十月革命四十周年佳节时的珍贵喜讯和纪念礼物。
    1952年，苏联人民通过苏联红十字会慷慨地热诚地帮助我国，在我国首都北京建立了苏联红十字医院。为我国培养了医务干部，治疗了许多的疑难大症，再一次地体现了高度的国际主义精神和高度的革命人道主义精神。
    院内的一切医疗设备、药品、用具等都是苏联赠送的最新的优秀珍贵产品。五年来先后有一百二十六位苏联专家到院工作。他们丰富的技术经验、高贵的品质和优良的作风在中国人民中留下难忘的印象。
    今年3月19日，苏联政府和人民又慷慨无私地将苏联红十字医院的全部财产及装备无条件地移交给我国。正如同医院现在的名称——中苏友谊医院一样，中苏两国人民有着牢不可破的深厚友谊。现在，医院正在发展着，它将承担更多更重大的任务。我们向我们伟大的苏联朋友们保证：有着你们对我们这样深厚而伟大的友谊，有着我们的党的关怀和英明领导，我们一定会克服一切困难，早日完成苏联人民和中国人民所给予我们的光荣任务。
    我们毫不动摇地继续努力学习苏联，学习苏联医学的特色和特点，学习苏联同志的高度为人民服务的精神，学习其所表现的高度的有组织有计划有领导的集体主义精神，国际主义精神和革命人道主义精神。学习如何继承和发展这种优良传统的作风与精神，是我们纪念伟大十月革命节必须保证贯彻的有重大意义的工作。
    苏联的一切科学研究都是为了不断改善、提高劳动人民的生活水平和维护劳动人民的健康服务的，同时也是为全人类的和平幸福事业服务的。苏联是在世界上最先成功地运用了原子能为人类和平幸福事业服务，建立了世界上第一座原子能发电站和第一艘原子能破冰船的国家。同时为了保卫世界和平，苏联在原子武器和氢武器方面的技术成就也早已达到最先进的水平。最近苏联杰出的科学家们，紧接着洲际弹道导弹惊人成就之后，又很成功地发射出了第一颗人造地球卫星。我们对于苏联在科学技术上这样的辉煌成就，对于苏联一贯所执行的和平政策和它所体现的最高度的人道主义精神，表示无限的兴奋、鼓舞、钦佩和感谢。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念，适当我国人民反右派斗争取得了伟大胜利。反右派斗争是为了建设社会主义、保护社会主义的。因此，我们进一步继续彻底进行反右派斗争是有其重大政治意义的。解放以后，绝大多数知识分子都接受了党的教育而得到改造，并且在党的英明领导下已站到人民队伍里，忠诚老实地为人民服务和为祖国社会主义建设服务。八年来我们因参加了祖国建设事业，亲眼看见了国内惊天动地的伟大建设事业而感觉到光荣、愉快、骄傲。但右派分子别有用心，看不见解放后建设的辉煌成就，利用党整风的机会，向党疯狂进攻，用两面手法进行挑拨离间，否定一切成绩，妄图篡夺党的领导，把人民革命事业从社会主义的道路上拉回到正在灭亡的资本主义道路上去。这个恶毒的有组织有计划有纲领的反革命阴谋，及时地遭到了全中国人民的揭破和有力的反击。在反右派的斗争中，全国绝大多数医务工作者和全中国人民一起，站稳无产阶级立场，消除了温情主义，同右派分子坚决斗争到底，锻炼了自己，并提高了自己的政治觉悟。我们全国绝大多数医务工作者同全体中国人民一起，决心要更紧密地团结在共产党的周围，更认真地更努力地学习苏联，彻底改造自己，使我们每一个医务工作者都成为社会主义的红色卫生队伍的有力成员，高举着马克思列宁主义的旗帜，永远跟着共产党走。这是我们纪念十月社会主义革命伟大节日的最有意义的行动和最珍贵礼物。
