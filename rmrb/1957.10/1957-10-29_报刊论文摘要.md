	Is the Difference in Living Standards Between Workers and Peasants Inequality?
	Some people believe that the existing difference in income between workers and peasants is a form of inequality. If this "inequality" merely refers to the difference in income due to the different value created by workers and peasants individually, their different contributions to the country, and the different consumption levels in urban and rural areas, then this is acceptable. Because socialist society, compared to communist society, still retains inequality in the distribution of means of subsistence. The principle of distribution in socialist society is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." Since it is distribution according to work, there will be inequality. Those with strong labor power will have higher incomes, while those with weak labor power will have lower incomes. In a family with a large population and few laborers, the income per person will be less; in a family with a small population and many laborers, the income per person will be more. Although in our socialist society, there are various methods of assistance and relief for those with too little income, this inequality in living standards will still exist to some extent. Only when social productive forces have greatly developed and reached communist society, and the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need" is implemented, distributing means of subsistence according to need, will these differences be eliminated. However, if we understand the difference in income between workers and peasants as the same kind of inequality as that between landlords and peasants in the past, then we are greatly mistaken. This is because landlords are an exploiting class; they oppress and exploit peasants; while the working class relies on its own labor to support itself; it does not need to and cannot exploit anyone. The reason why the working class has more income than peasants is because the working class has a higher labor productivity than peasants and makes a greater contribution to the country. Therefore, we must never confuse the difference in income between workers and peasants with the kind of inequality by which landlords exploit peasants.

	Individualism is Dangerous
	Individualism is a product of the economic foundation of private ownership, especially bourgeois ownership. This ideology is contradictory to the socialist economic foundation. The socialist system requires that the interests of the individual be subordinate to the interests of the whole, and that the interests of the people be placed above the interests of the individual; while the bourgeoisie does not agree that the interests of the individual should be subordinate to the interests of the whole, and demands that the interests of the individual be placed above the interests of the people. Therefore, it is an inevitable trend that those who adhere to bourgeois individualism will develop from dissatisfaction with the socialist system to opposing the socialist system. Among our cadres, many come from exploiting class and petty-bourgeois families, or have been tainted by non-proletarian ideas, and many have varying degrees of bourgeois individualism. People with this kind of thinking can gradually eliminate this thinking as long as they dare to transform themselves in the education of the Party and in revolutionary practice. What is worth being vigilant about is that there are still some people who think that "a little individualism doesn't matter," which is extremely wrong and dangerous.

专栏：报刊论文摘要

    工农生活有差别是不平等吗？
    有人认为我们现在工农生活收入方面仍然有差别，就是不平等。如果这个“不平等”仅仅是指：因为工农个人方面所创造的价值不同，对国家的贡献不同，以及城乡生活的消费水平不同，因而在收入方面仍有差别，那么，这样说也未尝不可。因为社会主义社会比起共产主义社会来，在生活资料分配方面，还残留着不平等。社会主义社会的分配原则是“各尽所能，按劳取酬”，既然是按劳取酬，那就有不平等。劳动力强的，收入就多一些，劳动力弱的，收入就少一些。一个家庭，人口多，劳动力少，每人收入就少一些；人口少，劳动力多，每人收入就多一些。虽然在我们的社会主义社会里，对于收入太少的人有种种帮助和救济的办法。但是，这种生活收入方面的不平等还是会在一定程度上存在的。只有社会生产力有了很大的发展，到了共产主义社会，实行“各尽所能，各取所需”的原则，按照需要来分配生活资料，这些差别才会消灭。但是，如果我们把工农在生活收入方面的差别，理解为过去地主和农民那种不平等，那就大错特错了，这是因为地主是剥削阶级，它是压迫和剥削农民的；而工人阶级则是靠自己的劳动来养活自己的，它不需要也不能够剥削任何人。工人阶级在生活收入方面之所以比农民多，是因为工人阶级的劳动生产率比农民高，对国家的贡献比农民大。因此，我们绝不能把工人和农民在生活收入方面的差别，同地主剥削农民的那种不平等混为一谈。（摘自10月11日南方日报秦楚：“工农生活不该有合理的差别吗？”）
    个人主义是危险的
    个人主义是私有制特别是资产阶级所有制的经济基础的产物。这种思想意识是与社会主义经济基础相矛盾的。社会主义制度，要求个人的利益服从整体的利益，要求把人民的利益放在个人的利益之上；而资产阶级不同意个人利益服从整体利益，要求把个人的利益放在人民的利益上面。因此，坚持资产阶级个人主义思想的人，由对社会主义制度不满而发展到反社会主义制度，是一个必然趋势。在我们干部中，有许多人出身于剥削阶级和小资产阶级家庭，或者受了非无产阶级思想的沾染，不少人存在着不同程度的资产阶级个人主义思想。有这种思想的人，只要在党的教育下和革命实践中勇于自我改造，这种思想是可以逐步加以清除的。值得警惕的是，现在还有一些人认为“有点个人主义不算什么”，这是极端错误和危险的。（摘自10月13日河南日报社论：“继续克服反右派斗争中的右倾思想”）
