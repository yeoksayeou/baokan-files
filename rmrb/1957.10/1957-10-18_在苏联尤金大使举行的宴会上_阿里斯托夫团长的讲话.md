Comrade Liu Shaoqi, dear Comrades Zhou Enlai, dear comrades and friends!

Please allow me, on behalf of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the entire Soviet people, to extend to you, and through you to the entire Chinese people, the warmest fraternal greetings.

The delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is concluding its visit to China at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.

We are very pleased to have been able to meet with Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Comrade Zhou Enlai, other leading comrades of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Our delegation had useful and friendly talks with workers, peasants, scientists, artists, and members of the People's Committees of many provinces and cities in China.

During these meetings and talks, we have repeatedly and deeply felt the profound love and respect that the Chinese people hold for the Soviet people. Please allow me, on behalf of all members of our delegation, to express our heartfelt gratitude to you, our dear Chinese friends, for your warm welcome and hospitality.

Dear comrades! We have had many meetings and talks with representatives from all walks of life in China, and all of this has allowed us to see with our own eyes that the Chinese people are closely united as one big family, wholeheartedly supporting the policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

Since liberation, in a short period of time, the Chinese people have taken a big step forward. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has been basically completed. The foundation for the socialist industrialization of the country is now being successfully built.

Everywhere we visited, we saw the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in socialist construction.

The great construction project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge left a deep impression on us. This magnificent construction project truly demonstrates the strength of the new China of the people. We are proud of the talented and hardworking Chinese people for building such a large project in such a short period of time.

After visiting the steel capital of Anshan and the steel plant under construction in Wuhan, we are even more convinced that the Communist Party and the People's Government attach great importance to establishing and developing the foundation of national socialist industrialization—the ferrous metallurgical industry. I would also like to point out that in the construction of these huge iron and steel enterprises, all the achievements of modern smelting industry have been utilized, and large blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces have been built.

We visited the Changchun Automobile Factory, which is equipped with the most modern and highly productive equipment. This newborn infant of China's automobile manufacturing industry left us with an unforgettable impression.

The Chinese people have established these first-class heavy industrial enterprises and will be able to reach the world's scientific and technological level in the near future, and will be able to solve all the tasks that benefit the progress of all mankind.

Dear comrades and friends!

The fraternal alliance and friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China are built on the basis of common interests in the struggle for the victory of socialism and communism, and for world peace. This alliance and friendship plays an important role in the smooth development of our two countries. Our friendship is full of mutual assistance, exchange of experience, mutual learning, and a sincere desire to move forward shoulder to shoulder more quickly.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union attaches great importance to the exchange of visits by parliamentary delegations, because the personal contacts established between representatives of the parliament and the broad masses of the people help to further mutual understanding, enhance mutual trust between the peoples of various countries, and consolidate world peace. We are particularly pleased that a good tradition of mutual visits by delegations of the parliaments of our two countries and by state and party activists has been established between our two peoples. Such visits enable us to strengthen mutual understanding, thereby further strengthening our unbreakable friendship.

Please allow me, on behalf of the delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, to once again express our heartfelt gratitude to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, to Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee, for the kind care and hospitality we have received everywhere during our visit to China!

Please allow me to raise my glass to the hardworking and talented Chinese people, to the glorious Chinese Communist Party, to the further prosperity and achievements of the People's Republic of China, and to the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!

To the health of dear Comrade Mao Zedong, to the health of Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai, to the health of all members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and to the health of all Chinese friends present!

　　在苏联尤金大使举行的宴会上
    阿里斯托夫团长的讲话亲爱的刘少奇同志，亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    请允许我代表苏联最高苏维埃和全体苏联人民向你们，并通过你们向全中国人民致以最热烈的兄弟的敬礼。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表团应中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的邀请来中国进行了访问，我们在你们这个美好的国家里的访问就要结束了。
    我们这次能够同毛泽东同志、刘少奇同志、周恩来同志，同共产党和人民政府的其他领导同志们，以及同全国人民代表大会常务委员会的委员们见面，感到非常高兴。我们的代表团曾经同工人、农民、科学和文艺工作者以及中国的许多省、市人民委员会的委员们进行了有益的和友好的座谈。
    在这些会见和座谈的过程中，我们一次又一次地深深地体会到中国人民对于苏联人民所怀着的深厚敬爱的感情。请允许我代表我们代表团的全体团员向你们，我们亲爱的中国朋友们对我们的热烈欢迎和款待表示衷心的感谢。
    亲爱的同志们！我们同中国各阶层人民的代表进行了许多次会见和座谈，这一切都使我们亲眼看到中国人民紧密地团结成为一个大家庭，全心全意地拥护共产党和人民政府的政策。
    解放以来，在短短的期间内，中国人民向前迈进了一大步。对农业，手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经基本完成。现在正顺利地建设着国家社会主义工业化的基础。
    在我们访问过的地方，我们到处都看到了中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设方面所取得的巨大成就。
    武汉长江大桥这个伟大的建设工程给我们留下了深刻的印象。这个雄伟的建设工程真正表现了人民的新中国的强盛。在短短的时期内，建设了这样大的工程，使我们为天才的和勤劳的中国人民而感到自豪。
    在参观了钢都——鞍山和武汉的钢铁厂的建设之后，我们更加深信共产党和人民政府是非常重视建立和发展国家社会主义工业化的基础——黑色冶金工业的。我还愿意指出，在这些巨大的钢铁企业的建设中，运用了现代冶炼工业的一切成就，并建设了大型的高炉和平炉。
    我们参观了用最现代化的生产率最高的设备装备起来的长春汽车厂。这个中国汽车制造业的初生婴儿给我们留下了不能忘怀的印象。
    中国人民建立起这些头等的重工业企业，就能够在不久的将来达到世界科学技术水平，就能够解决一切造福于全人类进步事业的任务。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    苏中两国人民之间的兄弟联盟和友谊是建筑在为社会主义和共产主义的胜利，为世界和平而斗争的共同利益的基础之上的，这种联盟和友谊对我们两国的顺利发展起着重要的作用。在我们的友谊中，充满着互助、交流经验、相互学习、从而更迅速地并肩前进的真诚愿望。
    苏联最高苏维埃对于互派议会代表团进行访问极为重视，因为在议会的代表同广大阶层群众之间建立的个人联系有助于相互的进一步了解，有助于增强各国人民之间的相互信任和巩固世界和平。在我们两国人民之间已经建立了由两国议会代表团以及国家和党的活动家进行相互访问的良好传统，这使我们特别感到高兴。这样的访问使我们能够加强相互了解，从而使我们的牢不可破的友谊能够得到进一步的加强。
    请允许我代表苏联最高苏维埃代表团再一次地向全国人民代表大会常务委员会，向常务委员会委员长刘少奇同志，对于我们在访问中国期间到处受到的亲切的关怀和款待表示衷心的感谢！
    请允许我举杯为勤劳天才的中国人民，为光荣的中国共产党，为中华人民共和国的进一步的繁荣和它的成就，为中苏两国人民的永恒的、牢不可破的友谊干杯！
    为亲爱的毛泽东同志的健康，为刘少奇同志和周恩来同志的健康，为全国人民代表大会常务委员会的各位委员的健康，为所有在座的中国朋友们的健康干杯！
