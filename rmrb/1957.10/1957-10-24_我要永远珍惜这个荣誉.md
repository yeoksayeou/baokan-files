    I Will Always Cherish This Honor
    Nie Yinchu
      On the afternoon of September 18th, the Soviet Consul General in Urumqi, Kazanский, presented me with the "Order of Honor" on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. I was so moved that I almost burst into tears.
    I, the son of a poor peasant, am able to receive such a lofty honor, which should first and foremost be attributed to the Party and to our Soviet friends. The Party has taught me earnestly, and the arduous actions of Soviet comrades in Xinjiang have influenced me, so that in the tense moments by the Ertysh River, I could dedicate my own strength to rescue Comrade Stepanova, the female expert whose condition was critical. As a Communist Party member, this is my duty.
    I have been in Xinjiang for less than two years. Due to my responsibilities, I am often with Soviet experts. Every time I go with them into the field, I am constantly influenced by them. Their noble Soviet qualities have given me much inspiration.
    In 1955, I went to Yining with expert Andreyev. Andreyev could drive, and when he saw the driver driving for a long distance and was very tired, he let the driver rest temporarily and drove for him. The car broke down halfway, so he lay under the car and helped the driver repair it. When we arrived in Yining, we took the equipment from the warehouse and moved it to the Soviet Consulate in Yining. The warehouse was five kilometers away from the consulate, and Andreyev personally carried it back and forth to save public gasoline.
    In 1956, I followed geological expert I.A. Mikhailov to the Altai Mountains for exploration. In order to obtain geological data, he had to climb up even steep cliffs. Once, he climbed a steep slope of more than 20 meters and suddenly fell into a ditch. Fortunately, it was a dry ditch, without water or large stones, so he was not injured.
    One day, I went out with a Soviet female expert, and when we returned, it was already late at night. It was very cold at night, and we were walking in a deep ditch where the snow had not yet melted. We heard the roar of a bear in the distance. I was afraid that her safety would be compromised, but the female expert was still singing! When we found the tent we lived in, it was already two o'clock in the morning, and the next morning, she went to work as usual. I often think, aren't they far away from their hometowns, coming to these remote mountains, living in tents, braving wind and rain, for the sake of our country's socialist construction? Isn't it for the happiness of our people?
    When we traveled from Urumqi to the Altai Mountains, passing through the Junggar Basin, seeing those farms and those heavy cotton bolls, I thought there were the merits of Soviet comrades here! When we passed through Karamay, seeing the derricks standing on the plains, seeing the cars loaded with crude oil, I thought there were also the merits of Soviet comrades here!
    In 1955, when our field team was first established, there were many students who had just graduated from school. They lacked practical work experience, and their technical operations were not skilled. Now these comrades are able to work independently, and some comrades have even taken up the post of captain. This is inseparable from the patient training of Soviet comrades! Whenever I think of the scene of experts working in the field, and the touching scene of giving raincoats to our comrades when it rained, I am very moved. We should learn from their serious, responsible, and hardworking spirit, and learn from their noble qualities.
    On the evening of August 25 last year, we escorted the female expert who had just undergone surgery to Urumqi for medical treatment. When we arrived at the ferry crossing of the Ertysh River, the ferry was on the opposite bank. The strong wind and the rushing water drowned out our calls to the ferryman. Expert Mikhailov walked back and forth anxiously, trying to find a solution. The groans of Comrade Stepanova stimulated me. In this emergency, could I stand by and do nothing? A sense of responsibility spurred me on, and the exemplary behavior of Soviet comrades in peacetime encouraged me. I put on the driver's gloves, grabbed the steel cable at the ferry crossing, and climbed towards the opposite bank.
    Who knew that this matter would be spread to the Soviet Union, and some comrades wrote letters to comfort me and encourage me. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet even awarded me a medal. I was truly overwhelmed with emotion, which educated me once again.
    I thank the friends who care about me. I will never disappoint your expectations. I will continue to work hard and always cherish this honor.

    我要永远珍惜这个荣誉
    聂银初
      9月18日下午，苏联驻乌鲁木齐总领事卡赞斯基代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团把“荣誉勋章”授予我，我感动得快掉下泪来。
    我，一个贫农的儿子，能够得到这样崇高的荣誉，首先应该归功于党，归功于我们的苏联友人。党谆谆地教导我，苏联同志在新疆艰苦卓绝的行动影响我，使我在额尔齐斯河边紧张的时刻，献出自己的一分力量，来抢救病情危急的女专家斯捷潘诺娃同志，作为一个共产党员，这是我应尽的责任。
    我来新疆不到两年，由于我的职责，能够经常和苏联专家在一起。每次我随他们出发到野外，不断地受到他们的熏陶，他们崇高的苏维埃人品质，给我许多启发。
    1955年，我和专家安德烈夫去伊宁。安德烈夫会驾驶汽车，他见到司机长途驾驶，很疲倦，便让司机暂时休息，自己代他开。汽车在半路上发生故障，他就躺在车下，帮助司机修理，我们到伊宁，从仓库里取出器材搬往伊宁苏联领事馆，仓库距领事馆有五公里，安德烈夫为了节省公家的汽油，亲自来回地搬运。
    1956年，我随着地质专家伊·阿·米哈依洛夫去阿尔泰山勘探，为了取得地质资料，哪怕是陡削的山崖，他都要爬上去。有一次，他爬上一处二十多公尺的陡坡，突然跌到沟内，幸好是一条干沟，没有水，没有大的石头，才没有受伤。
    一天，我随着一位苏联女专家出去，等到转来，已经是深夜了。夜里很冷，我们在一条积雪尚未溶化的深沟内走着，远处传来熊的吼声，我唯恐她的安全发生问题，可是女专家还在歌唱哩！当我们找着住的帐篷时，已经是深夜两点钟，第二天清早，她又照常地出工了。我经常想，他们远离家乡，来到这些偏僻的深山里，住帐篷，风里来雨里去，不是为了我国的社会主义建设事业吗？不是为了我国人民的幸福吗？
    当我们从乌鲁木齐前往阿尔泰山，经过准噶尔盆地，见到那一座一座的农场，见到那累累的棉桃，我想这里有着苏联同志的功绩啊！当我们经过克拉玛依，见到那耸立在平原上的井架，见到那满载着原油的汽车，我想这里面也有苏联同志的功劳呵！
    1955年，我们野外队初成立时，有很多刚从学校里出来的学生，他们缺乏实际工作的经验，技术操作也不熟练。现在这些同志都能够独立工作了，有的同志还担任了队长的职务。这是和苏联同志耐心的培养分不开的啊！每当我想到专家在野外劳动的情景，想到下雨时让出雨衣给我们同志的动人场面，我都很感动，我们应当学习他们认真负责艰苦耐劳的精神，学习他们高尚的品质。
    去年8月25日晚上，我们护送刚开过刀的女专家前往乌鲁木齐就医，到了额尔齐斯河渡口，那渡船却在河对岸，狂风和流水吞没了我们呼唤摆渡工人的声音，米哈依洛夫专家焦急地走来走去想办法，斯捷潘诺娃同志呻吟的声音刺激着我，在这紧急的时刻，我难道坐视不救吗？责任感鞭策着我，苏联同志平日的模范行为鼓励着我，我戴上司机的手套，揪住渡口上的钢丝绳，向对岸攀援过去了。
    谁知这件事传到苏联，有的同志写信来慰问我，勉励我，最高苏维埃主席团还授予我勋章，我真有说不出的感动，使我再一次受到了教育。
    我感谢关心我的友人，我决不辜负你们的期望，我要继续努力，永远珍惜这个荣誉。
