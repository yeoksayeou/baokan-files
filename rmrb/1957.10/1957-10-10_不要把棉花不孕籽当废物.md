    Don't Treat Cotton Infertile Seeds as Waste
    Our processing department at the Handan Raw Cotton Factory in Hebei Province recently successfully experimented with processing linters from infertile seeds, which were previously treated as waste. The results of two experiments showed that forty pounds of infertile seeds yielded thirteen pounds of good cotton and eighteen pounds of secondary cotton. According to our factory's annual processing task, there are more than 30,000 pounds of infertile seeds, which can be processed into about 27,000 pounds of cotton. If the infertile seeds from all factories across the country are utilized, the country can increase the production of a large quantity of linters. Therefore, I suggest that raw cotton factories in all regions utilize infertile seeds. (Liang Hongru)

    不要把棉花不孕籽当废物
    我们河北省邯郸原棉厂的加工部门，最近利用当做废物处理的不孕籽试验加工絮棉成功。两次试验结果，四十斤不孕籽出好棉花十三斤，次棉十八斤。如果按我厂全年加工任务计算就有三万多斤不孕籽，可以加工出棉花二万七千斤左右。若把全国各个厂的不孕籽都利用起来，就可以为国家增产大批絮棉，所以我建议各地的原棉厂把不孕籽利用起来。（梁鸿儒）
