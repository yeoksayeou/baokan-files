Correcting the Shortcoming of Insufficient Attention to "Rectification While Correcting"
    Progress in the Rectification Campaign at Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1

    (Our Dispatch) Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1 has corrected the shortcoming of insufficient attention to "rectification while correcting" in the rectification campaign.

    After the "blooming and contending" began, the mill's leadership did not pay enough attention to the issue of rectifying while correcting. Therefore, the morale of some of the masses was affected. After discovering this situation, the Party Committee of Cotton Mill No. 1 established three "rectification while correcting" teams to analyze and study the criticisms raised by the workers and staff. Anything that could be changed was changed immediately, and anything that could be resolved was resolved immediately. The unevenness and poor quality of the cotton yarn produced by the South Spinning Workshop of the mill was a long-standing problem that had not been solved. This time, the mill director, chief engineer, and leaders of the South Spinning Workshop concentrated their efforts to improve their work, greatly improving the situation. Tao Fuxiang, the head of the Safety Technology Section, had been stiff in his style in the past, and many people had opinions about him. This time, he copied all the criticisms raised against him from the big-character posters into his own notebook for future reference. The masses reflected, "Now Tao Fuxiang consults with us on matters."

    Seeing that the Party and the leadership were determined to correct shortcomings and mistakes, the masses had even greater confidence in helping the Party in the rectification campaign. In the past week, more than 90% of the workers and staff have joined the rectification campaign.

    纠正了对“边整边改”注意不够的缺点
    上海国棉一厂整风运动有进展
    本报讯  国营上海第一棉纺织厂在整风运动中纠正了对“边整边改”注意不够的缺点。
    “鸣放”开始以后，该厂领导上对于边整边改的问题注意不够，因此，部分群众情绪就受到影响。国棉一厂党委发现这一情况后，就成立了三个“边改”小组，对职工们提出的批评意见，进行分析研究，凡是能改的马上改了，能解决的马上解决了。该厂南纺工场生产的棉纱条不匀、质量不好是个长期未能解决的问题，这次厂长、总工程师和南纺工场领导人员集中力量，改进了工作，使情况大为好转。安全技术科长陶福祥，过去因为作风生硬，许多人对他都有意见。这次他把大家给他提出的批评意见，一一地从大字报上抄在自己的小本子上，留作借鉴。群众反映说：“现在陶福祥有事也和我们商量了。”
    群众看到党和领导上有决心改正缺点和错误，帮助党整风的信心更加增强了。近一个星期来，有90％以上的职工投入了整风运动。
