Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 20th -- Xi'an City has formulated a plan to streamline organizations and reduce cadres in municipal Party and government organs, as well as in management departments of enterprises and institutions, by 30% to 40%.

The plan stipulates: Party and government organs and mass organizations at the Xi'an city level should reduce their staff by an average of more than 30% based on the original establishment. Management cadres in the industrial system should generally account for only 7% to 10% of the total number of employees after streamlining. Management cadres in the capital construction system should account for only about 9% to 12% of the total number of employees after streamlining. Universities and secondary technical schools should generally reduce their existing staff by 25% to 40%. The plan requires that organizational structures be vigorously streamlined first, that superfluous and overlapping institutions be resolutely abolished, that institutions with similar functions be merged, and that the levels of management and production guidance be reduced as much as possible. Secondly, the staffing levels should be vigorously streamlined to achieve careful calculations and eliminate any redundancy.
