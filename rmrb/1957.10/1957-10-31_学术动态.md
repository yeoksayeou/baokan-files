    The Origin of Chinese Rice is in Southern China
    The origin of Chinese rice is in southern China, and Chinese rice varieties were not introduced from India or Japan. This argument, recently put forward by rice expert Professor Ding Ying at the Chinese Rice Science and Technology Conference held in Wuhan, has attracted the attention of all attendees. Rice experts from the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam, who were invited to attend the conference, as well as Chinese rice experts, professors, and other agricultural scientists, all believe that this will attract the attention of agricultural scientists in China and around the world.
    Ding Ying, President of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and a rice expert, has written a scientific paper entitled "The Origin and Evolution of Cultivated Rice Varieties in China" after a long period of careful research. He first proved, based on the geographical distribution of wild and cultivated rice varieties in China, classical records, a long history of cultivation, the development process, and unearthed relics, that Chinese rice cultivation began in the Shennong era (around 3000 BC), making it the oldest rice-growing country in the world. At the same time, he divided Chinese rice varieties into four types: indica and japonica, early and late, aquatic and terrestrial, and glutinous and non-glutinous. These types are distinguished according to Michurin's theory of the unity of organisms and external environmental conditions, and are formed due to differences in temperature in the cultivation area, the length of daylight in the cultivation season, the amount of water in the soil in the cultivation area, and the characteristics of the rice varieties. The cultivated species that created the rice culture in the Yellow River basin before the Common Era were mainly japonica rice, while the indica rice species were mainly distributed in subtropical plains in all seasons and in temperate plains, maturing early in the high-temperature season. He further believes that japonica rice evolved from the basic indica type.
    Many rice experts and professors believe that President Ding Ying's argument is a weighty one. It is not only a valuable work, but also has certain significance in the field of agricultural science worldwide. Soviet rice experts Zhulai and Urodarsky both suggested that President Ding Ying write a detailed monograph based on this paper for publication.
    Successful Research on Artificial Blood Vessels
    Professor Yu Wenguang, Director of the Clinical Surgery Teaching and Research Group of Zhejiang Medical College, has successfully performed artificial blood vessel transplantation in dogs, with smooth blood flow for more than ten months.
    Professor Yu Wenguang and his assistants Qi Yigeng, Zhu Shixin, Wang Shuqi, and Yao Zhuxiu have been conducting research on artificial blood vessels for more than a year. Inspired by the vascular suturing machine created by Soviet scientist Gudov, encouraged by Soviet expert and Chief Consultant of the Ministry of Public Health, Kochergin, and with the support and assistance of the Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, they used a high-polymer compound silk fabric to make a small tube by hand in December 1956 and transplanted it into a large dog. After the operation, the dog became fat and strong without any adverse reactions. On the afternoon of October 15 this year, Professor Yu Wenguang and others dissected the dog and, after examination, proved that the transplanted artificial blood vessel was unobstructed. They performed a vivisection on this artificial blood vessel and found that a layer of milky white fibrous tissue had grown outside the blood vessel, and except for being slightly thicker, it had become one with the original aorta at the suture lines at both ends; a layer of milky smooth film had also grown on the inner wall of the artificial blood vessel, which was the same as the thin film on the inner wall of the original artery. This proves that after the artificial blood vessel is transplanted into the dog, the function of blood transfusion is the same as that of the original blood vessel.
    In the past, when the human body underwent surgery due to trauma or diseases such as aneurysms, it was necessary to use allogeneic blood vessels to replace the excised blood vessels. Because healthy human blood vessels were not easy to obtain, surgery was often impossible, or amputation had to be performed, resulting in disability or death for the patient. The successful experiment of artificial blood vessels will solve the problem of blood vessel supply and play a great role in ensuring the health of patients. (Zhejiang)

    中国水稻起源于我国南部
    中国水稻起源于我国南部，中国稻种不是从印度、日本引进来的。最近在武汉召开的中国稻作科学技术会议上，水稻专家丁颖教授提出的这个论据，引起了全体到会者的注意。应邀出席这次会议的苏联、朝鲜、越南等国的水稻专家和我国的水稻专家、教授以及其他农业科学工作者都认为，这将引起中国和世界各国农业科学工作者的重视。
    中国农业科学院院长、水稻专家丁颖，经过了长时期的悉心研究，写出了题为“中国栽培稻种的起源及其演变”的科学论文。他首先根据我国野生稻种和栽培稻种类型的地理分布、古典记载、悠久的栽培历史、发展过程和出土遗迹证明：我国稻作开始于公元前三千年的神农时代，是世界稻作最古老的国家；同时，他把我国稻种分为籼粳稻型、早晚稻型、水陆稻型和粘糯稻型等四种类型。这些类型是根据米丘林关于生物体同外界环境条件的统一的学说区分的，是由于栽培地带的温度、栽培季节的日照长短和栽培地区的田土水分多少，以及稻种特性的差异等不同而形成的。公元前在黄河流域创建稻作文化的栽培种主要是粳型稻种，分布于亚热带平地的各季节和温带平地在高温季节早熟的主要是籼型稻种。他进一步认为粳种是由基本型的籼种分化而成的。
    很多水稻专家和教授都认为丁颖院长的论证是一个有分量的论断。它不仅是一篇有价值的论著，而且在世界农业科学领域中也有一定的意义。苏联水稻专家朱赖、乌洛达尔斯基都建议丁颖院长把这个论文报告详尽地写成著作出版。
    人造血管研究成功
    浙江医学院临床外科教研组主任余文光教授在狗身上施行人工血管移植术成功后，已通畅输血达十个月以上。
    余文光教授和他的助手齐伊耕、朱士鑫、王淑琪及姚竹秀等医师对人造血管的研究工作已进行了一年多。他们在苏联科学家古道夫创造的血管缝合机的启发和苏联专家、中央卫生部首席顾问柯切尔金的鼓励以及中共浙江省委宣传部的支持、帮助下，于1956年12月将一种高聚化合物的丝织品用手工制成小管，移植到一只大狗身上。施行手术后，狗身体肥壮，没有任何不良反应。今年10月15日下午，余文光教授等对这只狗进行解剖，经过检验，证明移植的这段人造血管是通畅的。他们把这段人造血管做了活体解剖，发现血管外面已生了一层乳白色纤维组织，除了体积稍粗外，已和原来的主动脉在上下两端缝合线结成一体；人造血管的里壁也长了一层乳色的光滑薄膜，和原来动脉内壁的薄膜相同。这证明，人造血管移植到狗身上后，输血的功能同原来的血管无异。
    过去，人体因外伤或患动脉瘤等疾病而施行手术时，必须用同种异体血管来代替切除的血管，由于健康的人体血管不易得到，常使手术无法进行，或不得不进行截肢手术，以致造成病人的残废或死亡。人造血管的实验成功，将解决血管的供应问题，对保证病人的健康有很大作用。（浙）
