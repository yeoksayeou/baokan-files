Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 14th. An article recently published in the Soviet "Red Star" pointed out that since the establishment of the world's first socialist country in Russia forty years ago, there are now thirteen countries in the world advancing under the banner of socialism, possessing 26% of the world's territory and about 35% of the population. The achievements of these countries in all aspects clearly demonstrate the enormous superiority of socialism over capitalism.

The article said that the industry of socialist countries is growing at an unprecedented rate. Their proportion in world industrial production is constantly increasing, and now accounts for about one-third. Of the machines currently produced in the world, one in three is produced by socialist countries; Czechoslovakia alone exports one-tenth of the total machine tools exported by all capitalist countries.

Compared with 1913, the Soviet Union's industrial production has increased thirty-three times this year, while the United States has only increased about four times during the same period. The achievements made by other socialist countries in industry in a short period after the establishment of the people's government are several times greater than the achievements made by capitalist countries in industry over decades. In old China, the highest annual steel output was only 923,000 tons, while in the seventh year after the establishment of the people's government, the annual output increased to 4.5 million tons. In People's Poland, machine production last year has increased to nine times the pre-war level. Romania now produces as much electricity and steel in three months as it used to produce in a whole year.

The article also said that the world is now seeing the superiority of the socialist economic system. In socialist countries, industrial production grows much faster than in capitalist countries. From 1950 to 1955, the average annual increase in industrial production in the Soviet Union was 13.3%, in China it was 24.9%, in Albania it was 24.2%, in Bulgaria it was 13.1%, in Hungary it was 13.5%, in East Germany it was 13.1%, in Poland it was 16.1%, in Romania it was 15.7%, and in Czechoslovakia it was 10.8%. During the same period, the average annual increase in industrial production in the United States was only 4.2%, in the United Kingdom it was 3.4%, and in France it was 6.3%. Due to the rapid development of socialist industry, the Soviet Union is now rapidly catching up with the most advanced capitalist countries in terms of industrial output per capita.

In agriculture, socialist countries have also made great achievements. The Soviet Union has established the largest-scale agriculture in the world. China has basically completed the transition from individual production to cooperative agricultural production. Bulgaria's agricultural cooperative system has been established, and collectively managed agricultural land last year accounted for about 80% of the country's cultivated land. In other socialist countries, the socialist sector in agriculture is also constantly expanding. The technical equipment of agriculture in these countries is also improving day by day. Before the revolution, Russian peasants used millions of wooden plows to cultivate land, while the Soviet Union now has more than 1.5 million tractors alone. In Poland, about 65,000 tractors were working for farmers last year. In the same year, Bulgaria's agriculture added more than 6,700 tractors and about 1,000 combine harvesters. The "Red Star" article concluded by saying that the world socialist system is victoriously fighting against the aging world capitalist system. The balance of power on the international stage is increasingly favorable to socialism.

Xinhua News Agency, October 14th. TASS reported: Academician Ostrovityanov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences published an article in "Pravda" on the 14th, saying that the socialist economic system is showing its superiority more and more clearly year by year in the peaceful competition with the capitalist economic system.

He said that the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system lies in the more rapid development of production in the socialist countries. In 1956, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries exceeded the pre-war level by more than three times, while the capitalist countries only exceeded the pre-war level by about 90%. The proportion of industrial production in the socialist camp in world industrial production increased from 1929 to 1956 as follows: coal—from 2.7% to 37.8%, electricity—from 2.1% to 17.4%, iron—from 4.1% to 25.8%, steel—from 4% to 24.5%.

The rich and diverse natural conditions of the socialist camp countries have created superior conditions for the comprehensive development of agricultural production. The grain output of socialist countries now accounts for about 40% of the world's total grain output, the cotton output accounts for more than 30% of the world's output, and the livestock in socialist countries accounts for more than 16% of the world's total livestock.

### 社会主义大家庭日益繁荣  工农业生产增长速度空前

　　社会主义大家庭日益繁荣
    工农业生产增长速度空前
    新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联“红星报”最近发表的一篇文章指出，从四十年前世界上第一个社会主义国家在俄国建立以来，到现在世界上已经有十三个国家在社会主义旗帜下前进，它们拥有全世界26％的领土和约35％的人口。这些国家以自己各方面的成就向人们清楚地表明了社会主义对资本主义的巨大优越性。
    文章说，社会主义国家的工业正在以空前未有的速度增长着。它们的工业生产在世界工业生产中所占的比重不断增加，现在已经占约三分之一。在全世界目前生产的机器中，每三个就有一个是社会主义国家生产的；单是捷克斯洛伐克输出的机床数量就占所有资本主义国家机床输出总量的十分之一。
    和1913年比较，苏联的工业生产今年增加到三十三倍，而同时期美国大约仅增加到四倍。其他社会主义国家在人民政权建立后的短时期内在工业方面所取得的成就，要等于资本主义国家工业在几十年间所取得的成就的好几倍。在旧中国，钢的最高年产量只有九十二万三千吨，而在人民政权建立后第七年年产量就增加到四百五十万吨。在人民波兰，去年的机器产量已经增加为战前水平的九倍。罗马尼亚现在每三个月生产的电力和钢，已经等于过去全年的产量。
    文章又说，全世界现在看到了社会主义经济制度的优越性。在社会主义国家，工业生产增长速度比资本主义国家快得多。从1950年到1955年，苏联工业生产每年平均增加13.3％，中国平均增加24.9％，阿尔巴尼亚平均增加24.2％，保加利亚平均增加13.1％，匈牙利平均增加13.5％，民主德国平均增加13.1％，波兰平均增加16.1％，罗马尼亚平均增加15.7％，捷克斯洛伐克平均增加10.8％，而在同一时期，美国工业生产每年平均只增加4.2％，英国平均增加3.4％，法国平均增加6.3％。由于社会主义工业的迅速发展，苏联现在正在按人口平均计算的工业产量上迅速地追赶最先进的资本主义国家。
    在农业方面，各社会主义国家也取得了伟大的成就。苏联建立了世界上规模最大的农业。中国已经基本上完成了从个体生产向合作化农业生产的过渡。保加利亚的农业合作化制度已经确立，集体经营的农业土地去年已经约占全国耕地80％。在其他社会主义国家中，农业中的社会主义部分也在不断扩大。这些国家农业的技术装备也在日益改进。革命以前俄国农民用几百万架木犁耕种土地，而苏联现在单是拖拉机就有一百五十多万台。在波兰、去年已经有约六万五千台拖拉机在为农民工作。同一年，保加利亚农业中就增加了六千七百多台拖拉机和约一千台联合机。“红星报”的文章最后说，世界社会主义体系正在同老朽的世界资本主义体系胜利地进行斗争。国际舞台上的力量对比越来越有利于社会主义。
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联科学院院士奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫14日在“真理报”发表文章说，社会主义经济体系在同资本主义经济体系的和平竞赛中，一年比一年更加明显地显示出它的优越性。
    他说，社会主义体系对资本主义体系的优越性在于各社会主义国家的生产有着更迅速的发展。1956年，苏联和其他社会主义国家的工业总产量超过战前水平三倍以上，而资本主义国家则仅超过战前水平约90％。社会主义阵营的工业生产在世界工业生产中所占的比例从1929年到1956年的增涨情况如下：煤——从2.7％增加到37.8％，电力——从2.1％增加到17.4％，铁——从4.1％增加到25.8％，钢——从4％增加到24.5％。
    社会主义阵营国家丰富而多种多样的自然条件给农业生产的全面发展造成了优越条件。社会主义国家的谷物产量现在在世界谷物总产量中约占40％，棉花产量占世界产量的30％以上，各社会主义国家的牲畜在世界牲畜总数中占16％以上。
