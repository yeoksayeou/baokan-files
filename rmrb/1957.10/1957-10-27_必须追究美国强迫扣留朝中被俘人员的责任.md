    At the October 22nd meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, the United States once again raised its long-bankrupted demand that the Korean and Chinese sides account for the whereabouts of so-called 450 American "prisoners of war." This is another manifestation of the U.S. imperialists' plot to poison the international atmosphere and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, following their violation of item 13(b) of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    As is well known, the only POW issue concerning the Korean Armistice is the U.S. side's forcible detention of 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, not any American "POW" issue. This has not only been affirmed by the final report of the Korean Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission but also acknowledged by the U.S.'s own chief negotiator, Harrison, and the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, Clark. The U.S.'s attempt to overturn the case with a small, fabricated issue of the so-called 450 "prisoners of war" is futile.

    The crimes of the U.S. imperialists in violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and all the norms of modern international law, and in murdering and forcibly detaining captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides with unparalleled cruelty, are countless. The Korean and Chinese people will never forget the U.S. imperialists' bloody atrocities and will pursue this matter to the end. In January 1954, after the U.S. side forcibly detained more than 21,000 captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides once again, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai solemnly declared: "The U.S. side bears full responsibility at all times for tracing and returning the more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war forcibly detained this time, and the more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war forcibly detained from June 18 to 22, 1953, and for providing an explanation to the Korean and Chinese sides. We also reserve the right to submit this issue to the Korean political conference and other relevant international conferences for discussion. Regardless of when the political conference is held, and regardless of where these prisoners of war are forcibly detained, as long as the U.S. side does not trace and return them, we will not give up pursuing the U.S. side for this crime!"

    The Korean and Chinese sides strictly abided by the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding prisoners of war and repatriated all prisoners of war from the United Nations Command side. The list of 450 so-called "prisoners of war" put forward by the United States is not only fabricated and without any tenable basis, but has also long been accounted for by the Korean and Chinese sides. Now that the United Nations Political Committee is about to discuss the Korean issue, in order to escape condemnation for violating item 13(b) of the Korean Armistice Agreement, in order to escape the anger of the Korean people for continuing to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and for continuously inflicting atrocities on the Korean people in South Korea, the United States has once again trotted out this moldy trick, attempting to divert attention and confuse the public. This is doomed to failure.

    The serious problem is that the United States has not only failed to trace and return more than 48,000 detained prisoners of war, but even for the list of 98,742 captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides submitted by the U.S. to the International Committee of the Red Cross for transmission to the Korean and Chinese sides, it has not yet provided an explanation. The United States has no excuse to evade its responsibility. The Chinese people firmly demand that the United States provide a specific explanation by name and trace and return all detained personnel. We will not stop until we achieve this goal.

    必须追究美国强迫扣留朝中被俘人员的责任
    本报评论员
    在10月22日朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上，美国又提出了它的早就破了产的要求朝中方面交代所谓四百五十名美国“战俘”下落的问题，这是美帝国主义继破坏朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项以来又一次企图毒化国际气氛、阻挠朝鲜和平统一的阴谋的表现。
    如所周知，在有关朝鲜停战问题上唯一存在的战俘问题是美方强迫扣留四万八千名朝中战俘的问题，而不是什么美国“战俘”问题。这不但为朝鲜中立国遣返委员会的最后报告所肯定，而且也为美国自己的首席谈判代表哈利逊和联合国军总司令克拉克所承认。美国企图拿出一个小小的虚构的所谓四百五十名“战俘”问题来翻案是徒劳的。
    美帝国主义者违反朝鲜停战协定和现代国际公法的一切准则以无比残酷的兽性手段杀害和强迫扣留朝中方面被俘人员的罪行是罄竹难书的。朝鲜人民和中国人民永远不会忘记美帝国主义的血腥暴行，并且将追究到底。1954年1月，美方再次强迫扣留朝中被俘人员二万一千余名以后，我国周恩来外长曾经郑重声明：“美国方面对于这次被强迫扣留的二万一千九百余名朝中战俘和1953年6月18日至22日被强迫扣留的二万七千余名朝中战俘在任何时候都负有全部追回、并向朝中方面提出交代的责任，我们并保留把这个问题提交朝鲜政治会议及其他有关国际会议讨论的权利。并且不论政治会议何时召开，不论这些战俘被强迫扣留在什么地方，只要美方一天不把他们追回，我们就一天不放弃对美方这种罪行进行追究！”
      朝中方面严格遵守朝鲜停战协定关于战俘问题的规定，全部遣返了联合国军方面的战俘。美国所提出来的四百五十名所谓“战俘”名单，不仅是虚构的、没有任何站得住脚的根据的，而且也早已得到朝中方面的交代。现在联合国政治委员会即将讨论朝鲜问题，美国为了逃避人们对于它破坏朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项的谴责，为了逃避朝鲜人民对于它继续阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决和在南朝鲜不断对朝鲜人民施加暴行的愤怒，竟再度搬出这套发了霉的诡计，企图转移视线和混淆视听，这是注定要失败的。
    严重的问题在于美国不但对于四万八千余名被扣留的被俘人员至今没有追回，即使对于美方向红十字国际委员会提出，由该委员会转交朝中方面的九万八千七百四十二名朝中方面被俘人员的名单也至今未作交代。美国没有任何借口逃避它的责任。中国人民坚决要求美国作出逐名的具体交代，并追回所有被扣人员，不达目的，决不罢休。
