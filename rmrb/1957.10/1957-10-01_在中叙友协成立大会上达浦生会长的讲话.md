Friends and Comrades:

    Today, we gather in Beijing to celebrate the establishment of the China-Syria Friendship Association. We are delighted to see friends from Syria and other Arab countries joining us in this celebration. Allow me, on behalf of all members of the association, to extend our warmest gratitude to them.

    The purpose of our association is to promote cultural exchange between China and Syria, enhance mutual understanding between the people of China and Syria, and develop friendly relations between China and Syria. Let us, at this inaugural meeting, wish the China-Syria Friendship Association success in contributing to the friendship between our two peoples.

    China and Syria are both countries with long histories and cultures, and there is a traditional friendship between the two countries. In particular, both of our countries were liberated from the oppression of colonialism, and this shared experience has linked us together. Like the people of our two countries and other Asian and African countries, we earnestly hope to enhance cultural exchange and friendly cooperation between the two countries in accordance with the spirit of the Bandung Conference. In the past two years, people-to-people exchanges between the two countries have been very frequent. Our two governments have established close political, economic, and cultural relations. Our exhibition groups, art troupes, acrobatic art troupes, religious delegations, and our youth, students, journalists, and film industry representatives have all visited Syria successively. Syrian parliamentary delegations, legal workers delegations, cultural delegations, youth, women, and journalists have also visited or are visiting our country. During the above mutual visits, we have seen an ironclad fact: how strong is the desire of our two peoples to enhance friendly relations. Syrian friends established the Syrian-Chinese Friendship Association in Damascus, the capital of Syria, a few days ago. Today, we have established the China-Syria Friendship Association. This is just one example of the development of friendly relations between our two peoples. Friends and comrades, compared to our traditional friendly relations, our re-establishment of relations once severed by colonialists is still very young. There is a broad prospect for cultural exchange and friendly cooperation between our two countries, and we must redouble our efforts to promote the realization of our friendly aspirations.

    As we hold the inaugural meeting of the China-Syria Friendship Association, all the people of China are closely watching the U.S. ruling clique's conspiracy to invade Syria. The Chinese people firmly stand on the side of the Syrian people. We deeply sympathize with and support the Syrian people's just struggle to safeguard sovereignty and Asian-African peace. We firmly condemn the U.S. ruling clique's blatant acts of interference. The Chinese people believe that as long as the Syrian people are united, the invaders will surely fail.

    Finally, let us shout:

    Long live the friendship and unity between China and Syria!

    Long live the Syrian people who are fighting for justice!

### 在中叙友协成立大会上达浦生会长的讲话

    在中叙友协成立大会上达浦生会长的讲话亲爱的朋友们、同志们：
    今天我们在北京集会庆祝中国叙利亚友好协会的成立。我们很高兴地看到叙利亚和其它阿拉伯国家的朋友们，同我们一道来参加这个庆祝盛会。让我代表协会的全体会员热烈地向他们致以谢意。
    我们协会的宗旨是促进中叙两国的文化交流，增进中叙两国人民的相互了解，发展中叙两国的友好关系。让我们在这个成立大会上，预祝中叙友协在增进我们两国人民的友谊上作出贡献。
    中国和叙利亚都是历史文化悠久的国家，两国之间有着传统的友谊关系。特别是我们两国都是从殖民主义的压迫下解放出来的，这一共同遭遇曾把我们联系在一起。我们两国人民和其它亚非国家人民一样，殷切地希望按照万隆会议的精神，增进两国间的文化交流和友好合作。近两年来的两国人民交往是十分频繁的，我们两国政府已经建立密切的政治、经济、文化关系，我国的展览团、艺术团、杂技艺术团、宗教代表团和我国的青年、学生、新闻记者和电影界代表，都已经先后访问了叙利亚，叙利亚的议员代表团、法律工作者代表团、文化代表团、青年、妇女、记者也都先后访问了或正在访问我国。在以上相互访问中，我们看到一个铁的事实，我们两国人民增进友好关系的愿望是多么强烈。叙利亚朋友们已经在前几天在叙利亚首都——大马士革，成立了叙中友好协会。今天我们又成立了中叙友好协会。这不过是我们两国人民发展友好关系的事例之一。朋友们、同志们，比起我们传统友好关系来说，我们重新建立起一度为殖民主义者所隔断的关系还是很年轻的。我们两国的文化交流和友好合作还有着广阔的前途，我们要加倍努力促进我们友好愿望的实现。
    在我们举行中叙友协成立大会的时候，我们全中国人民正在密切注视着美国统治集团的侵略叙利亚的阴谋活动，中国人民坚决站在叙利亚人民一边，我们深切同情并且支持叙利亚人民为维护主权和亚非和平而进行的正义斗争。我们坚决谴责美国统治集团的粗暴干涉行为。中国人民相信，只要叙利亚人民团结一致，侵略者是一定会失败的。
    最后，让我们高呼：
    中叙友好团结万岁！
    为正义而斗争的叙利亚人民万岁！
