Kunming, October 5th (report from our newspaper) - The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee instructed all localities to make the issue of agricultural cooperatives concealing production and privately distributing grain an important part of the debate. The large-scale debate centered on this issue is now fully underway in more than 20,000 agricultural cooperatives in Yunnan Province. According to the situation of the debates in more than 300 key townships and cooperatives that have already ended, the phenomena of concealing production, falsely reporting disasters, and privately distributing grain all exist to varying degrees. In Qinlao Cooperative of Fumin County, there are many tricks to conceal production. Some teams collectively concealed and privately distributed 2,700 catties of wheat and broad beans. Some teams distributed more than 5,000 catties of surplus grain from the cooperative. Some teams cheated on scales and measures and overstated cattle feed, distributing a total of more than 20,000 catties of grain. In Pulong No. 1 Cooperative of Mile Yi Autonomous County, two production teams underreported production and distributed as much as 25,000 catties of rice. Some cooperatives reported minor disasters as major disasters, reported no reduction in production as a reduction in production, did not count spring-sown miscellaneous grains as grain, and did not count potatoes as grain. These kinds of disguised concealment of production have been found in various places. In order to further and realistically ascertain grain production and establish a selfless and overall consideration spirit among peasants, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to simultaneously criticize spontaneous tendencies in the major debate while persisting in carrying out education on national concept and overall concept, and to seriously criticize individualism and departmentalism. The methods are: to carry out positive education against individualism and departmentalism among Party members, cooperative cadres, and the masses, and to use the self-criticism of conscious cooperative cadres and members to promote exposure and criticism; especially to thoroughly criticize the facts of spontaneous tendencies and embezzlement and theft of grain by individuals with serious circumstances to promote criticism and self-criticism among the masses. In the final handling of concealed production, different methods should be adopted to deal with different situations.

    隐瞒产量对不对　私分粮食好不好
    云南二万多农业社展开大辩论
    本报昆明5日电　云南省委指示各地把农业社隐瞒产量、私分粮食问题，作为辩论的重要内容。云南省二万多个农业社以此为中心的大辩论，正在全面展开。根据已经结束的三百多个重点乡社辩论的情况，隐瞒产量、虚报灾情、私分粮食的现象，都或多或少的存在着。富民县勤劳社瞒产花样颇多，有的队集体隐瞒，私分小麦、蚕豆二千七百斤，有的队多分社的余粮五千多斤，有的队在秤、斗、多报牛饲料等方面弄虚作假，多分粮食共计二万多斤。弥勒彝族自治县普龙一社有两个生产队少报产量，多分稻谷达二万五千多斤。还有些社把轻灾报重灾，不减产报成减产，小春杂粮不算粮食，薯类不算粮食等等变相的瞒产，各地都有发现。云南省委为了进一步切实弄实粮食产量，树立农民中大公无私照顾整体的风气，要求各地在坚持进行国家观念、整体观念的教育及在大辩论中批判自发倾向的同时，还要认真批判个人主义、本位主义。其办法是：在党内和社的干部及群众中正面进行反对个人主义和本位主义的教育，运用觉悟的社的干部及社员的自我批评，去推动揭发批判；特别是针对情节恶劣的自发倾向和贪污盗窃分子的事实，进行彻底的批判，去推动群众中的批评与自我批评。在最后处理隐瞒产量时，要分别不同情况，采取不同的方式加以处理。
