Real Gold Fears No Fire; Truth Fears No Debate
Red Star Cooperative Members Recognize the Unparalleled Superiority of Cooperatives

(Our dispatch) The Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Sujiabao, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, recently conducted a socialist grand debate centered on the question of whether cooperativization had superiority, and refuted the various erroneous arguments of the wealthy middle peasants.

**Living Standards Increased, Not Decreased**

Did the living standards of farmers rise or fall after the advanced cooperativization? Poor and lower-middle peasants and upper-middle peasants had different views on this question. At first, some upper-middle peasants believed that after the advanced cooperativization, the income of farmers decreased and their living standards declined. Many poor and lower-middle peasants used the facts of their increased income and improved lives after joining the cooperative to debate. Some upper-middle peasants still insisted on their own views, saying: The income of poor and lower-middle peasants increased, but their income decreased. For example, Li Xijun said, "After working hard in the advanced cooperative for a whole year, I can't even afford enough rations." Liu Yujie and Qiu Fengchi immediately revealed his background: his family had 260 yuan in sideline income this year, bought a brand-new bicycle in the summer, and didn't want to pay the 34 yuan in rations owed to the cooperative, it's not that he couldn't afford rations. Do all wealthy middle peasants have to reduce their income after joining the cooperative? Everyone thought not. Su Manxin had two mules and a cart before joining the cooperative and was one of the wealthiest households in the village. This year, his family of five can receive more than 780 yuan from the cooperative, and his family sideline can also earn more than 80 yuan. Why is Su Manxin's family income so high? Mainly because they are willing to work. Even in the cold winter, they never stopped working. There are two types of upper-middle peasants whose income decreases after joining the cooperative: one is those who are not active in labor. For example, Zhang Xun returned his horse-drawn carriage and mules after joining the cooperative, sold the mules, and rented the horse-drawn carriage to others for 30 yuan a month, and rarely worked in the cooperative himself. The second is those who only work for themselves and not for the cooperative. For example, Liu Dexiang often traffics chickens and sheep to Taiyuan for sale, earning exorbitant profits, and only does 80 workdays in the cooperative a year. Although the income of such people has decreased from the perspective of the cooperative, the actual income of the whole family has not decreased. Everyone calculated the workdays done by ten wealthy middle peasant households. With the same labor force, upper-middle peasants did an average of 15% fewer workdays than lower-middle peasants.

After a debate, the cooperative announced its income situation for this year, with an average income of 80 yuan per person for the entire cooperative. By household, 60% of the households in the village have reached the living standards of wealthy middle peasants. Everyone compared the situation before and after cooperativization and believed that farmers had three major changes in their lives: First, better food and clothing; second, more houses were built, and an entire street was newly built in the village; third, there were many bicycles, with ninety-five in the village, most of which were bought last year and this year. Finally, everyone agreed that farmers now do not lack food or money, but demand better food and spend more money.

**The Cooperative Is Much More Superior Than Individual Farming**

Is the cooperative better or individual farming? In the debate, some upper-middle peasants proposed: When farming individually, farmers labored in the morning, and after eating, they went to the fields immediately. After cooperativization, they did not labor in the morning, and they had to wait for the captain to call everyone together after eating; individual farming was meticulous, but cooperativization was rough; individual farming used production materials sparingly, but cooperativization wasted them. The poor and lower-middle peasants were confused when they saw that these were all facts. In order to help cooperative members distinguish right from wrong, the cooperative cadres checked these shortcomings on the one hand and pointed out to the cooperative members on the other hand: The shortcomings of the cooperative should be distinguished from the question of whether the cooperative system is good. The superiority of the cooperative should be viewed from the fundamental system. In this way, the debate began. After discussion, everyone felt that the most prominent superiorities of the cooperative were three points: First, the scale of operation is large, which can achieve crop rotation and planting according to local conditions. Everyone said that if it weren't for the advanced cooperative, more than 1,300 mu of cotton could not have been planted this year, and income would not have increased. Some said that in the past, when farming individually, sorghum was planted for seven or eight years without crop rotation, and the yield decreased year by year. This year, crop rotation was implemented, and the planting was reasonable, and the sorghum had a bumper harvest. Second, there are many people and great strength, not afraid of disasters. This year, the cooperative built a canal, which allowed 400 mu of land to be irrigated at once. During the summer drought, the cooperative used methods such as carrying water to irrigate more than 360 mu of land. Everyone said that individual farming could not handle these things no matter what. Third, cooperative members are not afraid of natural disasters and man-made calamities. Liu Zizhi was ill for a whole year last year, and the life of his family of eight was taken care of by the cooperative. He said, "If it were the old society, I would have to sell my children." The two young brothers, Wang Kaifu, have no parents, and the cooperative provides them with five guarantees and supplies them with schooling. Everyone said, "If it were the old society, these two children would have to beg for food."

**Four Freedoms After Joining the Cooperative**

"The advanced cooperative is good, but it's a bit unfree," which is also a common thought problem among cooperative members. In order to solve this problem, the Party branch came up with a topic: What freedoms does the advanced cooperative have, and what unfreedoms does it have, and let the cooperative members debate. As a result of the debate, it was recognized that the advanced cooperative is not unfree, but very free. According to everyone's opinions, the advanced cooperative has four freedoms: First, the freedom to use the cooperative's production materials equally. Everyone felt the most deeply that three-quarters of the households did not have livestock when farming individually. If they wanted to use livestock to grind flour and pull charcoal, they had to beg the livestock owners repeatedly, even at a high price, but still couldn't use them. Now, grinding flour can freely use the cooperative's livestock, and charcoal burning is uniformly arranged by the cooperative. Second, there is a division of labor in production, and labor is free. When farming individually, if you planted a few mu of land, you had to do everything. After working all day, you still had to feed the livestock at night. Now, according to the cooperative's arrangements, each person only does one kind of work, and does whatever work they are good at. After returning from work, you can rest freely at home, learn culture, and if you are happy, you can go to the club to sing operas and listen to operas. Third, production is managed by the cooperative in a unified way, and you don't have to worry about your own thoughts. When farming individually, you had to plan both production and life. Now, production is arranged by the cooperative, and after the bonus, you only plan how to live a good life. Fourth, in the past, if you planted a few mu of land, you didn't dare to leave your home. Now, there are many people and great strength, who can go out to engage in sideline occupations, and you don't have to worry about the land being deserted if you ask for leave to visit relatives and friends. However, some people do not deny the above freedoms, but say that they still have some unfreedoms. Everyone asked them to speak out, and Li Dachang said, "When farming individually, I didn't go to the fields until the sun was high, and I went home before noon. After joining the cooperative, the captain called me to the fields, and we worked together, went to the fields together, and went home together. This is unfreedom." Everyone criticized him for disliking unfreedom because he didn't want to work. Then, they discussed what other unfreedoms there were. Some said that those who wanted to engage in speculation and profiteering disliked unfreedom, some said that landlords and rich peasants could not talk nonsense and disliked unfreedom, and some said that buying and selling land was unfree. Finally, everyone compared these two kinds of freedom and unfreedom, and the cooperative members realized that the cooperative has many freedoms that cannot be enjoyed when farming individually for those who are willing to take the socialist road. However, for those who do not love labor and are nostalgic for the capitalist road, there are many unfreedoms. After distinguishing this boundary, some said: "As far as our cooperative is concerned, it is not that there are few freedoms, but that there are too many freedoms, and there is no discipline. Some people can not work if they don't want to work, can go out casually without asking for leave, and no one interferes with commercial speculation activities. Such freedom should be less in the future."

After this grand debate, the cooperative members unanimously reflected: "After this education, the socialist position has been stabilized." Some people who originally wavered and asked to leave the cooperative said: "Even if you beat me with a stick, I won't leave." (Bai Xinghua)

    真金不怕炼　真理不怕辩
    红星社员认清合作社无比的优越性
    本报讯　山西省平遥县苏家堡红星农业社，不久以前围绕着合作化是否具有优越性的问题，进行了一次社会主义大辩论，驳倒了富裕中农的种种错误论调。
    生活提高了不是降低了
    高级合作化后，农民的生活水平提高了还是降低了？对这个问题，贫农下中农和上中农有不同的看法。开始时，有些上中农认为高级合作化以后，农民的收入是减少了，生活水平是降低了。很多贫农和下中农用自己入社后收入增加生活改善的事实进行辩论后，有些上中农还是坚持自己的看法，说：贫农和下中农的收入是增加了，但他们的收入是降低了。如李希俊说：“入了高级社整整劳动一年，连口粮也领不起”。刘玉杰和丘凤池马上翻出了他的老底：他家今年有副业收入二百六十元，夏季买了一辆崭新的自行车，欠下社内三十四元口粮款不想给，并不是领不起口粮。富裕中农入了社是不是就都要减少收入呢？大家认为不是的。苏满信入社前有两头骡子一辆车，是全村数一数二的富裕户，今年全家五口人，可以从社内分到七百八十多元，家庭副业还可以收入八十多元。苏满信家的收入为什么这样多？主要因为他们肯劳动，就是寒冷的冬天，他们也没有停止过干活。上中农入社后收入减少的有两种人：一种是劳动不积极。如张勋入社后把马车和骡子又退出来，骡子出售，马车按每月三十元出租给别人，自己就很少在社劳动。第二种是只给自己劳动不给社内劳动。如刘德祥经常贩卖鸡羊到太原卖，赚取暴利，一年才在社内做八十个劳动日。这种人从社内看收入减少了，全家的实际收入并未减少。大家算了十户富裕中农所做的劳动日，同样的劳动力上中农平均比下中农少做劳动日15％。
    经过一场辩论后，社内宣布了今年的收入情况，全社每人平均收入可以达到八十元。按户来看，全村有60％的户达到了富裕中农生活水平。大家又把合作化前后作了对比，认为农民在生活上有三大变化：第一，吃穿好；第二，修盖房子的多，全村整整新建了一条街；第三，自行车多，全村有九十五辆，其中绝大部分是去年和今年买的。最后，一致认为农民现在不是没吃的，没钱花，而是要求吃的更好些，花的更多些。
    合作社比单干优越得多
    到底合作社好还是单干好？在辩论中，有些上中农提出：单干时农民早晨劳动，一吃完饭马上又下地，合作化后早晨不劳动了，吃过饭还要等队长唤齐人才走；单干时做活细致，合作化后做活粗糙；单干时使用生产资料节约，合作化后浪费。贫农和下中农看到所提这些都是事实，也就被搞糊涂了。为了帮助社员辨明是非，社干部一面检查了这些缺点，一面向社员指出：要把合作社的缺点和合作制度好不好的问题区别开，合作社优越不优越要从根本制度上看。这样，争论便展开了。经过讨论，大家感到合作社的优越性最突出的有三点：第一，经营规模大，能够倒茬轮作和因地种植。大家都说要不是高级社，今年就种不了一千三百多亩棉花，收入也就不能增加。有的说过去单干时种高粱七、八年不倒茬，产量一年比一年低，今年实行倒茬，种植得合理，高粱获得大丰收。第二，人多力量大，不怕灾害。今年社内修渠一条，使四百亩土地伏浇一次。在夏季天旱时，社内又用担水等办法浇地三百六十多亩。大家说这些事单干无论如何也办不到。第三，社员不怕天灾人祸。刘子治去年闹了一年病，全家八口人的生活都是社内照顾的，他说：“如果是旧社会非得卖儿女不可”。王开富小兄弟俩没有爹娘，社内给予五保，供给读书，大家说：“如果是旧社会，这两个孩子非讨吃不可”。
    入了社有四大自由
      “高级社是好，就是有些不自由”，这也是社员中普遍存在的一个思想问题。为了解决这个问题，党支部出了一个题目：到底高级社有那些自由，那些不自由，让社员辩论。辩的结果，认识了高级社不是不自由，而是很自由。综合大家的意见，高级社有四大自由：第一，有平等的使用社内的生产资料的自由。大家感到最深刻的是单干时有四分之三的人家没有牲口，自己磨面、拉炭想用牲口，出上大价钱向有畜户再三求告，还是用不上。现在磨面可以自由使用社内的牲口，烧炭有社内统一安排。第二，生产有了分工，劳动自由。单干时种上几亩地，什么活都得干，白天劳动一天，黑夜还得喂牲口。现在根据社内的安排，每人只干一种活，而且有什么本领就干什么活。劳动回来后，可以在家里自由自在的休息，学文化，高兴起来就到俱乐部唱唱戏，听听戏。第三，生产由社统一经营，自己思想上不发愁。单干时既要计划生产，又要计划生活，现在生产由社安排，分红后只计划怎样过好生活。第四，过去种上几亩地，寸步不敢离开家。现在人多力量大，能出外搞副业，请假出外探亲友也不怕荒了地。但是，还有些人并不否认以上的自由，只是说自己还有些不自由的地方。大家就叫他们讲出来，李大常说：“单干时我太阳多高才上地，不到中午就回家，入了社上地队长唤，工作一齐干，统一出地，统一回家，这就是不自由”。大家批判他嫌不自由原来是不想劳动。接着，又讨论还有些什么不自由，有的说是想做投机买卖的人嫌不自由，有的说是地主富农不能胡说乱道嫌不自由，有的说是买卖土地不自由。最后让大家对比了这两种自由和不自由，社员们认识了合作社对于愿意走社会主义道路的人来说有很多单干时不能享受的自由。而对那些不爱劳动和留恋资本主义道路的人则有很多不自由。分清了这个界限后，有的说：“按咱社来说，不是自由少，而是自由太多，没有纪律了。有些人不想劳动就可以不劳动，不请假就可以随便外出，搞商业投机活动也没有人干涉，像这样的自由今后应该少些”。
    经过这次大辩论后，社员一致反映：“经过这次教育，社会主义的立场是站稳了。”有些原来动摇要求出社的人说：“就是用棒子打也打不走了”。　（白兴华）
