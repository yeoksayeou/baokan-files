　　Black Board News Editing
　　Kang Tieshan
    After lunch, everything seemed very quiet. Even the football fans were driven away for a nap by the scorching sun.

    At this time, four or five young men from the machining workshop, the editors of the "Alarm Bell" blackboard newspaper, were arguing in the corner of the workshop about publishing a piece of news. One of them, named Yan Zhen, said, "Based on his consistent behavior, he takes home every piece of scrap metal and rag he finds. No matter what, in my opinion, if we want to criticize him, we must investigate it thoroughly."

    Before he could finish speaking, Xiao Chen said unhappily, "Investigate, investigate again! Can't you believe what you saw with your own eyes? Many times it's your idea to turn fresh news into old news! I insist on doing it immediately."

    Zhao Hengyao was the moderator. He had discovered this matter and questioned the person on the spot. It seemed there would be no discrepancy in the situation. However, what Yan Zhen said made sense, and what Xiao Chen said was exactly what he wanted. What should he do?

    "Take a vote! The minority submits to the majority," Xiao Chen said again, puffing out his cheeks.

    As a result, even Yan Zhen slowly raised his hand.

    Zhao Hengyao happily sat down at the workshop director's office and buried himself in writing the article.

    The matter was originally like this:

    Yesterday, Xiao Zhao was the safety duty officer for the workshop. After getting off work in the afternoon, while checking the switches, he suddenly saw someone squatting next to a lathe, rummaging for something. He was immediately shocked: "Sabotage!" He quietly tiptoed behind this person, watching from across the lathe, holding his breath, not daring to make a sound.

    This person was wearing oily overalls, one hand on the ground, the other holding an iron hook, fishing around in the oil pan under the lathe. In the blink of an eye, he hooked up something yellow with black in it and carefully placed it in the bamboo basket next to him.

    Xiao Zhao recognized him as the material clerk, Old Gao, and breathed a sigh of relief. He walked over and asked, "What are you doing!"

    Old Gao looked up, stood up, wiped his sweat with his sleeve, and said angrily:
    "Look, the good cloth is almost rotten!"
    "Then why are you still picking it up?"
    "Hey!" He winked, "It's useful. It's useless to the workshop, but it's useful to me." He turned around and squatted next to another lathe to continue fishing.

    Xiao Zhao came out after finishing the inspection and ran into Old Gao at the door again. He carried the full basket of rotten cloth with difficulty and asked Xiao Zhao with a smile:
    "Young man! Are you looking for a 'date'?"

    Xiao Zhao felt awkward and hurriedly changed the subject:
    "What's the use of these things to you?"

    Old Gao winked and said with a smile:
    "It's useful. ...Yes, I mean, I am going to find a match! How can a bachelor understand housework? Take it back, wash it clean, and use it as a shoe sole is also good!" After speaking, he laughed heartily.

    The whistle for the end of work sounded.
    "'Alarm Bell' has new news, hurry, hurry!"
    The blackboard was crowded, and some people even climbed onto the nearby fitter's workbench. Men and women, laughing and reading, the shorter ones on the outside didn't know who to listen to, only occasionally hearing comments like:
    "This article has a spicy kick; Old Gao will have a crying face!"
    "Make way, make way, the owner is here!"
    Everyone looked towards the shout and unconsciously made way. It turned out that Old Gao had been dragged over by a young man.

    Old Gao saw everyone smiling at him and winked, reading the title word by word:
    "'Picking up rags, the spirit of cherishing property is good!' Yes." He turned to everyone and said, "They were almost rotten!"
    "It's not over yet! This is only the first half!" the young man who brought him said with a smile.

    Old Gao winked again and continued reading:
    "'Taking it home, being selfish is not right!' Hmm!?"
    The old man looked at it, seeming angry and not angry, and said as he walked out:
    "I don't have time to finish reading it! ...It's half right. Hmm, half!"

    People had not completely left, and the editors were gathering in the corner again.
    "Which half did Old Gao say was right?"
    "Of course, the latter half! I don't agree with such a comprehensive statement!" Xiao Chen said confidently and complainingly.

    Yan Zhen continued, still unhurriedly:
    "Looking at his expression, it's hard to determine whether it's the first half or the second half. In my opinion, we must..."
    "Investigate, investigate!" Xiao Zhao laughed.
    "No way!" Xiao Chen said firmly, "He must make a self-criticism and return the things to the workshop. Only in this way can we establish the authority of the blackboard newspaper."

    The next day, a letter from the "Alarm Bell" editorial team was sent to Old Gao. The old man saw that it was asking him to make a self-criticism, smiled slightly, and casually put the letter in his pocket.

    Almost half a month passed, and the editorial team had not received a reply from Old Gao. Moreover, they heard reports that he had picked up rags several times after being criticized, and some people even saw him carrying old wooden sticks as thick as wine glasses home. This angered the editors. Proposed by Xiao Chen, drafted by Xiao Zhao, and titled by Yan Zhen, another article was published in the blackboard newspaper that day. The title was written in yellow chalk:
    "Criticism Unaccepted, New Tricks Emerge"

    The day after it was published, just after work, Old Gao came over and called Xiao Zhao aside, saying softly:
    "I thought you had forgotten it, and I had forgotten it too. Now that you're blasting me again, I'll tell you about it." He took out a small folded piece of paper from his pocket and said, "This is a letter to the workshop director. I didn't think it was anything, so I kept it with me and didn't hand it in. Take a look at it, and tear it up later." Xiao Zhao took the letter, becoming more and more surprised as he read it, and couldn't help but shout, "My God!" He turned around and ran away.

    The editors quickly gathered again, without any argument, and decided to publish another issue immediately, so that it could meet the workers before work the next morning.
    "Good news, good news! ...Oh my, so bureaucratic!"

    A girl shouted as if she had discovered a secret. With the shout, those wearing work clothes, holding tools, and carrying materials... all gathered around, and a crowd of people packed in front of the blackboard again.

    "Don't push, I'll read it!" Someone shouted, and immediately received unanimous support. Because everyone would soon have to start production.

    "Our newspaper unexpectedly received a letter from the General Affairs Section last night. The full text is as follows:
    Comrade Gao Jianchen of your workshop, cherishes national property, uses his spare time to collect rags and wooden sticks, and mobilizes his elderly wife and daughter, who came from afar to visit their parents, to work together tirelessly, making seventy-three floor mops, which were delivered to our section this afternoon. This is truly touching. ..."
    "Make way, make way, the owner is here!" It was the same mischievous young man who had brought Old Gao. No one read the letter anymore; people welcomed him with warm applause. (Attached image)
    "This is a letter to the workshop director. I didn't think it was anything, so I kept it with me and didn't hand it in. Take a look at it, and tear it up later."

　　黑板报编辑
　　康铁山
    午饭后，四处显得非常宁静。连那些球迷们也被当头的毒太阳赶去午睡了。
    这时，机械加工车间的四、五个小伙子，——“警钟”黑板报的编辑们正在工房的角落里为发表一件稿件争论着。一个叫严镇的发言说：“根据他的一贯的表现，平日碰到一根切屑一块破布都拿回家去，不管怎么，我的意见，要批评就要调查清楚”。
    还没等他说完，小陈不高兴地说：“又要调查调查！亲眼见的还能假？好多次都是你的主意，把新鲜事变成马后炮！我主张马上干。”
    赵恒耀是主持人，这事情又是他发觉的，并且当场查问了，看来情况不会有什么出入。但是，严镇说的也有道理，小陈说的又正合自己的心意，怎么办呢？
    “付表决！少数服从多数。”小陈气鼓鼓地又开腔了。
    结果，连严镇也慢慢地举起了手。
    赵恒耀便高兴地坐到工长办公室埋头写稿子去了。
    事情原来是这样的：
    小赵昨天是车间的安全值日。下午下班以后，正在检查电门时，突然看到有人蹲在车床旁掏什么，顿时心里一惊：“搞破坏。”便轻轻地蹓到这人背后，隔着一台床子望着，忍住气不敢做声。
    这个人穿了件油得发亮的工作服，一手撑在地上，一手拿个铁丝勾，往床子下面油盘里捞来捞去。眨眼间，勾上块黄里有黑的东西，小心地搁进身旁的竹篓里。
    小赵认出来这是材料收发员高老头，便嘘了口气，走近去问道：“您搞啥玩意啦！”
    高老头抬头望了下，站起身用衣袖揩揩汗，生气地说：
    “你看，好好的布都沤得快烂啦！”
    “那还捞起来干什么？”
    “嘿！”他挤了挤眼睛，“有用，车间没用我有用。”转身又蹲在另一台床子旁边捞去了。
    小赵检查完出来，在门口又碰上了高老头。他吃力地提着满篓子烂布，笑眯眯地问小赵说：
    “年轻人！有‘对鼻子’了吧！”
    小赵别扭了，慌忙岔开话题：
    “这些玩意您有个啥用啊？”
    高老头挤挤眼睛，微笑地说：
    “有用。……是啊，我说找个对象吧！单身汉哪懂家务事？拿回去，洗干净，衬个鞋底也是好的哇！”说完爽朗地笑了。
    下班的汽笛响了。
    “‘警钟’有新消息，快去快去！”
    黑板报前面围得紧紧的，有些人还爬上了靠近的钳工台。男的女的，笑的念的，站在外层的矮个子不知听谁的好，只能偶尔听到这样的评语：
    “文章这个辣劲，高老头会哭脸！”
    “让开让开，主人到来！”
    大伙往这喊声望去，不自觉地让开了路，原来是高老头被一个小伙子硬拉着来了。
    高老头看到个个都朝他发笑，挤了挤眼睛，一个字一个字地念着标题：
    “‘拾破布，爱惜财物精神好！’是啊。”他转过头对大家说：“差点都沤烂啦！”
    “还没完啊！这只上半截！”拉他来的那个小伙子笑着说。
    高老头又挤挤眼睛，接着看下去：
    “‘往家带，自私自利太不该！’嗯！？”
    老头看了，像生气又像没生气地，边说边往外走：
    “我可没功夫看完啦！……说对了一半。嗯，一半！”
    人们还没有完全离去，编辑们又在角落里凑在一块了。
    “高老头是谈哪一半对啦？”
    “当然是后一半！我就不同意标得这样全面！”小陈满有把握而又埋怨地说。
    严镇接上来了，仍然是不慌不忙地：
    “看表情，很难判定是前一半还是后一半，我的意见，必须……。”
    “调查调查！”小赵笑了。
    “不行！”小陈坚决地说：“一定要他作出检讨，把东西送回车间，只有这样才能树立黑板报的威信。”
    第二天，一封“警钟”编辑组的信送到了高老头手里。老头看到是要他检讨，又微微一笑，顺手把信插在口袋里。
    过了将近半个月了，编辑组还没有收到高老头的回信。而且又听到有人反映，在批评他以后他还捞过几次，甚至有人看见他连酒杯粗的旧木棒也往家背，这可惹怒了编辑们。由小陈提议，小赵起草，严镇标题，就在当天出版的黑板报上又登了一篇稿子。题目是用黄色粉笔写的：
    “批评不接受又有新名堂”
    登出来的第二天，刚刚下班，高老头走来把小赵叫到一旁，细声细语地说：
    “我以为你们忘了，我也忘了。现在又轰我，就和你说说吧。”他从口袋里掏出一张折成小块的纸条说，“这是一封给车间主任的信，我觉得没什么，搁在身上没交。你看看吧，回头撕掉就行啦。”小赵接过信，越看越惊奇，不禁大叫：“我的妈呀！”转身飞跑了。
    编辑们很快又聚在一起，没有任何争论，决定立刻再出刊一期，好让明早上班前和职工见面。
    “好消息，好消息！……哎呀，真官僚！”
    有个姑娘发现了秘密似地叫了起来。随着叫声，穿工作服的，拿着工具的，抱着材料的，……都围拢来了，黑板报面前又挤满了一堆人。
    “别挤啦，我来念！”谁喊了一声，马上得到一致的拥护。因为很快大家就要生产了。
    “本报昨晚意外地收到一封来自总务科的信，全文如下：
    你车间高建臣同志，爱护国家财产，利用业余时间收拾破布、搜集木棍，动员年老妻子和远道前来探望父母的女儿，废寝忘餐，共同劳作，扎成擦地板拖把七十三个，于本日午后送交我科，实为感人。……
    “让开让开，主人到来！”又是前次那个调皮的小伙子把高老头拉来了。信也没人念了，人们都以热烈的掌声来欢迎他。（附图片）
    “这是一封给车间主任的信，我觉得没什么，搁在身上没交。你看看吧，回头撕掉就行啦。”
