    Chengjiang County Basically Eliminates Sparrow Pest
    More Than 1.8 Million Jin of Grain Saved from Loss
    (Our newspaper, Chengjiang, October 21st) Yunnan Province’s Chengjiang County has basically eliminated the sparrow pest. In the past, Chengjiang was a county where sparrow pests were quite serious. From the time when rice and wheat were ripening, farmers had to take bamboo clappers, firecrackers, and other things to scare away sparrows early in the morning and in the evening. In 1954, 1.7 mu of early-maturing wheat in the Longjie Primary Cooperative was completely eaten. Last year, the state-owned farm test-planted one mu of "Nante No. 1" early rice, but it also failed to yield a harvest due to sparrow pests.
    Since the large-scale "eliminate the four pests" movement was launched last year, the number of sparrows in various townships has been significantly reduced. Now, no matter where you go, you can no longer see flocks of sparrows. Only a few can occasionally be seen in some tall trees. The early-maturing millet is no longer suffering from sparrow pests, and the late-harvested millet is not suffering much from sparrow pests either, so there is no need to scare away sparrows morning and evening like in the past. It is estimated that as long as one more spring (sparrow breeding season) and one more summer pass, Chengjiang can eliminate sparrows throughout the county.
    Chengjiang County's main methods for eliminating sparrows are: when sparrows are laying eggs, nests are raided or sealed with mud; when there is no grain in the fields, rice soaked in "Shi Di Han" is used to poison sparrows. Up to now, according to incomplete statistics, the county has eliminated more than 300,000 sparrows (including sparrow eggs). Calculated at six jin of grain eaten by each sparrow per year, a total of more than 1.8 million jin of grain can be saved from loss. "Shi Di Han" is the most effective of the various sparrow-killing agents tested in Chengjiang County. More than three-quarters of the 150,000 sparrows eliminated this year were poisoned to death with this drug.
    In addition, Chengjiang County has also achieved certain successes in eliminating rats, flies, and mosquitoes.

### 澄江县基本消灭雀害  一百八十多万斤粮食免于损失

    澄江县基本消灭雀害
    一百八十多万斤粮食免于损失
    本报澄江21日电　云南省澄江县基本上消灭雀害。澄江过去是雀害颇为严重的一个县份。从稻麦灌浆的时候起，每天清早和傍晚，农民们就得拿着竹拍子、爆竹等物去赶雀。1954年，龙街初级社的一亩七分早熟麦子全部被吃光。去年，国营农场试种了一亩南特号早稻，也因为雀害而没收成。
    自从去年大规模地展开“除四害”运动以来，各乡的麻雀都已显著的减少。现在，不论走到那里，成群的麻雀已经见不到了。只是在一些高树上，偶尔还可见到几只。早熟的谷子已不再遭到雀害，晚收的几坩谷子受雀害也不大，用不着再像过去那样早晚去赶雀了。据估计，只要再过一个春季（麻雀产卵季节）和一个夏季，澄江就可以在全县范围内把麻雀消灭。
    澄江县消灭麻雀的办法主要有二：在麻雀产卵时，用掏、用泥封巢；在田野没有粮食时，用“士的悍”浸米来药雀。到目前为止，据不完全的统计，全县已经消灭了麻雀三十多万只（包括雀蛋在内）。按每只麻雀每年要吃六斤粮食计算，共可少损失粮食一百八十多万斤。“士的悍”是澄江县试验的多种杀雀剂中效果最好的一种，今年消灭的十五万只麻雀中就有四分之三以上是用这种药药死的。
    此外，澄江县在消灭老鼠、苍蝇和蚊子方面，也取得了一定的成绩。
