Irish Representative's Hostility
By Our Correspondent
    In a speech on the Korean issue at the Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on October 14, the Irish representative, Conor Cruise O'Brien, made extremely shameless attacks and slanders against our government and people. He attempted to shift the responsibility for the continued division of Korea onto our government. He slandered the Chinese People's Volunteers' presence in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, claiming that it prevented Korea from achieving reunification through "supervised free elections." O'Brien's despicable behavior, which completely disregards the truth of the Korean issue and uses the United Nations platform to arbitrarily slander our country in the absence of our representatives, is absolutely intolerable to our government and people.
    O'Brien's entire speech, which makes no mention of the fact that the American invading army is occupying South Korea and attempting to permanently turn it into an American colony and military base for aggression, fully exposes for whom he is speaking. Everyone with a good memory understands that the Chinese people sent their volunteers into Korea to fight alongside the Korean People's Army because the American invading army was approaching the Yalu River, threatening our country's peace and security. The fact that a small number of Chinese People's Volunteers remain in North Korea is entirely due to the United States' constant violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, its attempts to reignite the Korean War, and its rejection of the Korean-Chinese side's proposal to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea. The Irish representative's distortion of the truth about the Korean issue, his failure to condemn the American aggressors, and his arbitrary slander of our government and the Chinese People's Volunteers can only indicate that he is speaking with the same voice as the American aggressors and has degenerated into a mouthpiece for the American aggressive bloc. O'Brien's so-called proposal for "supervised free elections" in Korea is an absurd proposal that the United States put forward long ago, and in reality, it means that the United States would control the Korean elections.
    Our government and people, in order to safeguard peace in the Asian region, have always firmly advocated that the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully, and have made unremitting efforts to this end. In the Korean armistice negotiations, in the Geneva Conference, and in all statements related to the Korean issue, our government and people have consistently maintained that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea as soon as possible, and that the peaceful reunification of Korea is the internal affair of the Korean people and should be resolved by the Korean people themselves, without interference from any country. Since the Geneva Conference, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has continuously appealed to the South Korean authorities to strive for the peaceful reunification of its motherland, and has taken various practical measures to promote contact between the people of North and South Korea and to develop economic and cultural ties between the North and South. However, these efforts by the Korean-Chinese side to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea have been unreasonably rejected by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique. Recently, the representatives of the Korean-Chinese side in the Korean Military Armistice Commission, in order to assist the Korean people in realizing their reasonable desire for North-South trade, suggested to the American side that both sides provide convenience for the people of North and South Korea to trade and exchange goods in the demilitarized zone, but this was also opposed by the American side. Therefore, the responsibility for Korea's failure to achieve peaceful reunification to this day does not lie with the Korean-Chinese side at all.
    The failure to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea is the result of the consistent obstruction and sabotage by the United States. The rapid withdrawal of American invading troops from South Korea and the return of South Korea to the Korean people is the key to achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the American aggressors are not only unwilling to withdraw their troops from South Korea, but have also moved their so-called "United Nations Command," originally in Japan, to Seoul, doing whatever they want in South Korea, arbitrarily massacring peaceful residents of South Korea, and attempting to occupy South Korea for a long time, making the peaceful reunification of Korea forever impossible.
    The attitudes of the Korean-Chinese side and the American side towards the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea are as distinct as day and night and cannot be distorted. The Irish representative's arbitrary reversal of right and wrong in his speech at the United Nations, in addition to exposing his intention to please his American masters and to be hostile to the Korean and Chinese people, can have no other result.

　　爱尔兰代表的敌意
　　本报评论员
    在联合国大会特别政治委员会10月14日的会议上，爱尔兰代表康诺·克鲁斯·奥勃莱恩关于朝鲜问题的发言，对我国政府和人民进行了极端无耻的攻击和诬蔑。他企图把朝鲜处于继续分裂状态的责任转嫁给我国政府身上。他诬蔑中国人民志愿军留驻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，使朝鲜不能通过“有监督的自由选举来实现重新统一”。奥勃莱恩这种根本不顾朝鲜问题真象，利用联合国讲坛在我国没有代表出席的情况下恣意诬蔑我国的卑劣行为，是我国政府和人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    奥勃莱恩的整篇发言，根本不提美国侵略军占据着南朝鲜和企图永远把南朝鲜变成美国殖民地和军事侵略基地的事实，就充分暴露他究竟是在替什么人说话。一切不会健忘的人都了解，中国人民所以派遣自己的志愿军进入朝鲜同朝鲜人民军并肩作战，是由于美国侵略军迫近鸭绿江，威胁着我国的和平安全。而中国人民志愿军现在还留下少量部队在北朝鲜，则完全是由于美国不断破坏朝鲜停战协定，企图重新挑起朝鲜战争，并拒绝朝中方面提出的从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队的建议的结果。爱尔兰代表歪曲朝鲜问题真象，对美国侵略者不加谴责，反而恣意诬蔑我国政府和我国人民志愿军，只能说明他是同美国侵略者一鼻孔出气，堕落成为美国侵略集团的应声虫。而奥勃莱恩所谓在朝鲜实行“有监督的自由选举”的主张，更是美国老早就提出过的荒谬主张，实际上是要由美国来控制朝鲜的选举。
    我国政府和人民为了维护亚洲地区的和平，一向坚定地主张朝鲜问题应当和平解决，并为此进行了不断的努力。在朝鲜停战谈判中，在日内瓦会议中，在一切有关朝鲜问题的声明中，我国政府和人民一贯认为一切外国军队应当迅速撤出朝鲜，朝鲜的和平统一问题是朝鲜人民的内政，应该由朝鲜人民自己去解决，任何国家不能加以干涉。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在日内瓦会议以后，为争取自己祖国的和平统一，曾经不断向南朝鲜当局发出呼吁，并采取了各种实际可行的措施来促进南北朝鲜人民的接触，发展南北经济、文化的联系。可是，朝中方面这些促进朝鲜和平统一的努力，却遭到美国和李承晚集团的无理拒绝。最近，朝鲜军事停战委员会中的朝中方面代表为协助朝鲜人民实现南北通商的合理愿望，曾向美国方面建议双方在非军事区给予南北朝鲜人民通商和物资交易的便利，同样遭到美国方面的反对。因此，朝鲜至今不能实现和平统一，其责任完全不是在朝中方面。
    朝鲜和平统一的不能实现，是美国一贯阻挠和破坏的结果。美国侵略军队迅速撤出南朝鲜，把南朝鲜交还朝鲜人民，是朝鲜实现和平统一的关键问题。可是，美国侵略者不但不愿从南朝鲜撤军，并且还把它原在日本的所谓“联合国军”司令部搬到了汉城，在南朝鲜为所欲为，任意屠杀南朝鲜的和平居民，企图长期侵占南朝鲜，使朝鲜的和平统一永远无法实现。
    朝中方面同美国方面对于朝鲜和平统一问题的态度，有如白天和黑夜一样显明，是不能加以歪曲的。爱尔兰代表在联合国的发言中任意颠倒黑白，除了暴露他有意讨好美国主子，敌视朝中人民，是不能有任何其他结果的。
