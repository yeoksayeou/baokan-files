　　Jumping Over Two Meters
　　——Ma Xianglong Writes a Brilliant Page in China's Track and Field History
　　By our reporters Ai Tiemin, Shi Yuzhong

　　On the evening of the 11th, the men's high jump event of the China-Soviet Union track and field exhibition competition was underway at the Wutaishan Stadium in Nanjing, attracting tens of thousands of spectators with its exciting performance.

　　When the bar was raised to 1.94 meters, Li Dapei, the high jump champion of this national track and field competition, was eliminated. Only two athletes remained in the competition: V. Sitkin of the Soviet Union and Ma Xianglong of the Yunnan team. The bar was raised to 1.97 meters, which was two centimeters higher than the national record of 1.95 meters set by Li Dapei. Historically, no Chinese athlete had ever cleared this height. V. Sitkin easily jumped over it. The referee issued the command "Number 851, jump!" Ma Xianglong prepared to start, and a round of applause erupted. The first time, Ma Xianglong failed to clear it. The audience continued to encourage this athlete with enthusiastic applause. Ma Xianglong took a deep breath and, after a calm approach run, jumped over the bar in one go. Thunderous applause broke out from the surrounding stands.

　　A moment later, the score board displayed "Two Meters." "Can he jump over two meters?" many people were discussing.

　　Ma Xianglong calmly walked to the starting point for his approach run. The shouts and applause of the surrounding audience merged into one, millions of eyes were fixed on him, and millions of hearts were filled with anticipation. The stadium suddenly fell silent. After a rapid approach run, Ma Xianglong nimbly jumped over the two-meter-high bar. As soon as his body landed in the sandpit, he was surrounded by people congratulating him, and cheers and applause resounded throughout the stadium. The leader of the Soviet team, P. Pugachev, and other athletes also came over to shake his hand warmly and congratulate him.

　　When the bar was raised to 2.03 meters, Ma Xianglong failed in all three attempts. However, the audience left the stadium with satisfaction.

　　The two-meter height that Chinese high jumpers had long hoped for has finally been broken today. The young athlete Ma Xianglong has written a glorious page in the history of Chinese track and field.

    11日傍晚，中、苏田径表演比赛的男子跳高在南京五台山运动场上进行着，成千上万名观众被这场精彩的表演比赛吸引住了。
    当横竿升到一公尺九十四公分时，这次全国田径比赛的跳高冠军李大培被淘汰了。参加比赛的七名运动员只剩下了两人，他们是苏联的弗·西特金和云南队的马翔龙。横竿上升到一公尺九十七公分，这个高度已比李大培创造的一公尺九十五公分的全国纪录高出二公分，在历史上还没有一个中国运动员能跳过这个高度。弗·西特金轻轻地一跃便腾身而过。裁判员发出：“八百五十一号跳”的口令，马翔龙准备起步了，周围响起了一片掌声。第一次，马翔龙没有能跳过去。观众继续以热烈的掌声来鼓励这位运动健将。马翔龙作了一下深呼吸，从容不迫地在一阵助跑后一下便跃过了横竿。四周的看台上爆发了雷鸣般的掌声。
    一会儿，报分台上出现了“两公尺”的标分牌。“能跳过两公尺吗？”很多人在议论着。
    马翔龙却沉着地往助跑的地点走去。四周观众的呼喊声和掌声响成了一片，千万双眼睛注视着他，千万颗心在期待着。场上顿时寂静下来。马翔龙在一阵快速的助跑下，灵巧地一跃飞过了两公尺高的横竿。他的身子刚一落在沙坑内，被祝贺的人群包围住了，欢呼声和掌声响成了一片。苏联队的领队普·普加乔夫和其他的运动员也都过来向他热烈握手祝贺。
    横竿升到二公尺零三公分时，马翔龙三次起跳都失败了。但是，观众却带着满意的心情离开了运动场。
    我国跳高运动员期望已久的两公尺高度，今日终于突破了。年轻的运动员马翔龙为我国的田径史写下了光辉的一页。
