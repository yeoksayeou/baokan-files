Xinhua News Agency, October 4th, Tunisian Dispatch: Tunisian President Bourguiba announced on October 3rd that Tunisia had decided to recall its ambassador to France. Bourguiba accused French colonial troops within Algeria of violating the Tunisian border. Since France announced its so-called "right of pursuit" in Algeria over a month ago, such border violations have become increasingly frequent.

In a radio address, Bourguiba said: "The situation has become such that we can no longer maintain friendly relations with France."

Bourguiba also said that he had notified Tunisia's representative to the United Nations and the American ambassador about the situation in Tunisia, and decided to withdraw some of the French expatriates from the Kif region on the border. Moreover, if the current situation continues, it is possible to evacuate all French expatriates in the area.

Bourguiba accused French Foreign Minister Pineau's speech in the National Assembly on September 30th of exerting pressure on Tunisia. Pineau had requested that the United States and other allies of France in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization refuse to supply Tunisia with weapons before the proposed Franco-Tunisian negotiations yield results.

For a month, French troops have continuously invaded the Tunisian border. A Tunisian government bulletin announced that French military aircraft bombed and strafed a Tunisian border village once again on October 3rd, injuring four residents.

The Tunisian General Labor Union called on all workers across the country on the 3rd to hold a four-hour general strike on the afternoon of the 4th to protest the recent French air raids on Tunisian border villages.

Many border towns in Tunisia held demonstrations to protest French aggression and demanded the distribution of weapons to defend the country. The demonstration in Kif was the largest, with more than 7,000 residents participating in the march. Tunisian authorities have ordered the closure of the French consulate in Kif.

French officials expressed "surprise" and "regret" over the Tunisian government's decision. The French Chargé d'Affaires in Tunisia also obeyed the government's order to call Tunisia's attention to the so-called "seriousness" of the decision to withdraw French expatriates from the Kif region.

    无法再同法国维持友好关系
    突尼斯宣布召回驻法大使
    突边境人民要求分发武器抵抗侵略者
    新华社4日讯　突尼斯消息：突尼斯总统布尔吉巴10月3日宣布，突尼斯已经决定召回它驻法国的大使。布尔吉巴指责阿尔及利亚境内的法国殖民军队侵犯突尼斯边境的行为。自从一个多月前法国宣布在阿尔及利亚享有所谓“追击权”以来，这种侵犯边境的事件越来越多了。
    布尔吉巴在广播演说中说：“情况已经如此，我们不可能再同法国维持友好关系。”
    布尔吉巴还说，他已经把突尼斯的情况通知了突尼斯驻联合国的代表和美国大使，并且决定从边境的基夫地区撤退一部分法国侨民。而且如果目前的局面继续下去的话，可能撤退这个地区的全体法侨。
    布尔吉巴指责法国外交部长比诺9月30日在国民议会上的发言是对突尼斯施加压力。比诺曾经要求美国和法国在北大西洋集团中的其他盟国在拟议中的法—突谈判没有结果以前拒绝供给突尼斯武器。
    一个月以来，法军不断侵袭突尼斯边境。突尼斯政府公报宣布，法军飞机10月3日又一次轰炸和扫射了突尼斯的一个边境村庄，有四个居民受伤。
    突尼斯总工会3日号召全国工人在4日下午举行四小时总罢工，抗议法国飞机最近对突尼斯边境村庄的侵袭。
    突尼斯许多边境城镇举行了示威游行，抗议法国的侵略，并且要求分发武器保卫国土。基夫举行的示威规模最大，有七千多居民参加了游行。突尼斯当局已经下令封闭法国在基夫的领事馆。
    法国官方人士对突尼斯政府的决定表示“惊奇”和“遗憾”。法国驻突尼斯代办还奉政府的命令要突尼斯注意决定撤退基夫地区法国侨民一事的所谓“严重性”。
