　　Welcome Performances by Vietnamese Artists
　　Long Yinpei
    I am extremely pleased to see, as if reunited with old friends after a long separation, the song and dance performances of Vietnamese artists once again on the stage in Beijing. Two years ago, the performances by Vietnamese comrades were warmly welcomed by the broad audience in the capital, and their wonderful song and dance performances are still deeply imprinted in my mind.

    What excites me even more is that, from this performance, we can see that Vietnamese artists, in the relatively short period of these two years, have made remarkable progress in both dance and music creation and the performing skills of the actors. Their achievements are truly amazing.

    For example, the "Bamboo Hat Dance," which won a silver medal at the Sixth World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship, brought the audience's hearts to a realm as beautiful as poetry and painting. At the opening, the girls cleverly used their bodies and bamboo hats to form a bright, colorful flower. As the music, as light and lively as the spring breeze, played, the petals of this flower scattered, revealing the young women's faces, full of youthful vitality and prettiness. They seemed to be the embodiment of flowers, blooming in the fields. Each time they changed formation or turned around, it was a very attractive and beautiful image. No one remembers exactly how many times they changed, but in short, it was inspiring and made people feel happy. Watching this dance is truly a refreshing and pleasant aesthetic enjoyment. Before the audience knew it, the girls returned to the still scene at the beginning, they disappeared, leaving behind the snow-white flower radiating its fragrance. This dance is an outstanding achievement of Vietnamese artists. Simplicity, freshness, and ingenuity are the characteristics of the dance structure; the music is magical, making people happy and intoxicated in a beautiful realm; the white flowers on the black hair, the yellow outerwear, and the petal-like bamboo hats harmoniously complement the youthfulness, purity, and beauty of the girls. It is so exciting and leaves a deep impression on the audience.

    The music of the "Harvest Dance" is very distinctive, its rhythm is brisk and inspiring. The dance and music are closely and perfectly integrated, making you feel that the music is stimulating the dancers to move, and in the movement of the dance, different notes leap out. This dance expresses the happiness of people who have achieved a good harvest, and the joyful and exhilarating emotions.

    "Spring Light on the Summit" is a dance by young men and women of the Miao ethnic group in Vietnam to welcome the spring, and to yearn for and pursue youthful happiness. The beauty of the girls and the strength and enthusiasm of the young men are intertwined into a lyrical song of dance. The skill of the young men's Lusheng dance is very complex and superb, and this dance shows the tenacity and courage of the Miao people. The young dancers performed it very successfully.

    Chinese audiences are familiar with the "Flower Snatching Dance" and the "Bamboo Grove Festivity Dance" that were performed at the evening party. Two years ago, we had already appreciated these two excellent works. The main plot of the "Flower Snatching Dance," snatching the flower stick, is a custom of the Vietnamese people. The flower stick symbolizes happiness. Whoever snatches the flower stick at the flower snatching festival held in the spring will be lucky in their work for the year and can win the love of the girls. The "Bamboo Grove Festivity Dance" expresses the close relationship between the army and the people, like one family, and the people's love and gratitude for the soldiers who are bravely fighting for their peaceful and happy life. The dancers dance in the middle of the bamboo poles, following the regular rhythm of the bamboo poles being struck. This requires the actors to have a high sense of rhythm, and the movements must be so skilled that they are pure and flawless. From the dancers' light and agile, calm and natural movements, the bamboo poles seem to not hinder them or distract them at all, which fully demonstrates that each of them has very high skills. This dance was originally danced by the Muong people to celebrate a bountiful hunt. Today, Vietnamese artists have given it a new theme, expressing the real life of the people, and it is so harmonious, complete, and seamless that we cannot but say that this is an example of developing and processing folk dance. I think these two dances are more complete artistically than what I saw in the past. For example, in the "Flower Snatching Dance," in my impression, the arrangement and handling of the plot is more compact and concise, and the final grand dance is also more beautiful and moving. It is not only a picture of a happy life, but also an exquisite and complete genre painting. The "Bamboo Grove Festivity Dance" is also the same. This time it gave me a deeper emotional infection. From this, we can understand the strict spirit of Vietnamese artists in their artistic creation. They are always pursuing higher levels, not satisfied with the achievements they have already made, and constantly processing their works. This serious attitude towards art is worthy of our learning.

    The singing and music performance programs brought by the Vietnamese Cultural Troupe this time were also warmly welcomed by the Chinese audience. In particular, Meng Sheng's solo performance of the gourd monochord, which is rich in national characteristics and won a gold medal at the Sixth World Youth Festival, and Shang Xian's female solo singing, which won a silver medal at the Sixth World Youth Festival, won enthusiastic praise from the audience. We believe that Vietnamese artists will achieve even more brilliant achievements in their future artistic practice.

　　欢迎越南艺术家们的表演
　　隆荫培
    我以极其愉快的心情，像重逢久别的老友一样，在北京的舞台上又一次看到了越南艺术家们的歌舞节目。两年前越南同志们的表演就受到了首都广大观众的热烈欢迎，他们精彩的歌舞表演还深深地印在我的心中。
    更使我兴奋的是：从这次的演出中，可以看到越南的艺术家们在这两年为时并不算长的时期中，不论是舞蹈和音乐创作，还是演员的表演技巧，都有着突飞猛进的提高，他们所获得的成就是非常惊人的。
    如获得第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节银质奖章的“竹笠舞”，就把观众的心带到了诗和画一样美丽的境界中去了。幕开时，姑娘们用身体的造型和竹笠巧妙地组织成一朵鲜艳的斑花；随着像春风一般轻快而跳动的音乐，这朵斑花的花瓣散开了，露出了少女们洋溢着青春活力和俊俏的面颊。她们好像是鲜花的化身，开放在原野上。她们每变换一个队形或一个转身，都是一幅非常吸引人的美丽的图形；谁也记不得她们到底有了多少次变换，总之，令人感到振奋和幸福。看这种舞蹈真是清新和舒畅的美的享受。在观众不知不觉中，姑娘们又恢复到开始时静止的场面，她们隐没了，留下雪白的斑花放射着她的芳香。这个舞蹈是越南艺术家杰出的收获。简洁、清新和巧妙是舞蹈结构的特色；令人欢快，沉醉在美的境界中是音乐的魔力；黑发上的白花，黄色的外装和像花瓣似的竹笠，谐合地陪衬出少女们青春的纯洁和美丽。它是如此激动人心，留给观众深刻的印象。
    “丰收舞”的音乐很有特点，它的节奏明快而又激奋人心。舞蹈和音乐紧密而完美地溶合在一起，使你感觉到音乐激发着舞蹈者跳动，在舞蹈的运动中又飞跃出不同的音符来。这个舞蹈表现了人们获得丰收的幸福，和令人欣喜的欢乐情绪。
    “山巅上的春光”是越南苗族青年男女在迎接春天，和向往、追求青春幸福的舞蹈。姑娘们的健美和青年们的强壮热情交织成一首舞蹈的抒情曲。青年们的芦笙舞技巧是非常复杂而高妙的，在这种舞蹈中表现了苗族人民坚韧和勇敢的性格，年青的舞蹈家们表演得非常成功。
    晚会中所表演的“抢花舞”和“竹丛联欢舞”，中国观众是熟悉的。两年前我们就曾经欣赏过这两个优秀的作品。“抢花舞”主要的情节抢花棒是越南人民的一种习俗。花棒象征着幸福，在春天所举行的抢花会上谁要是抢到了花棒，就预示他一年工作的幸运，并可以得到姑娘们的爱慕。“竹丛联欢舞”表现了亲如一家人的军民关系，人民热爱和感激为了自己的和平幸福生活而进行英勇斗争的子弟兵。舞蹈者的舞蹈是在竹竿中间、按着竹竿敲打出有规律的节奏进行的。这就需要演员具有高度的节奏感，动作熟练到炉火纯青的地步。从男女舞蹈家轻快如飞、安然自如的舞蹈行动中，竹竿好像丝毫也不妨碍他们和分散他们的注意力，这充分说明他们每个人都有着很高的技巧。这种舞蹈本来是芒族人民在庆祝狩猎丰收时才跳的。今天越南的艺术家付予了新的主题，表现了人民的现实生活，而且又是如此谐合、完整无间，我们不能不说这是发展和加工民间舞蹈的一个范例。我觉得这两个舞蹈在艺术上比过去见到的更加完整了。如“抢花舞”，在我的印象中，情节的安排和处理上更加紧凑和简洁了，最后的大家欢舞也更优美动人了。它不仅是一幅幸福生活的图景，还是一件精致完整的风俗画。“竹丛联欢舞”也是如此，这次它给我情绪的感染更加深刻。从这里使我们了解到越南艺术家对艺术创作要求的严格精神，他们永远在追求着更高的水平，不满足已经达到的成就，对作品经常不断地进行着加工的工作。这种对待艺术严肃的态度，是值得我们学习的。
    越南文工团这次带来的歌唱和音乐演奏节目，同样获得了中国观众的热烈欢迎。特别是获得第六届世界青年联欢节金质奖章的孟胜那富有民族特色的葫芦独弦琴的独奏，和获得第六届世界青年联欢节银质奖章的商弦的女声独唱，更是博得观众热情的赞赏。我们相信越南的艺术家们在未来的艺术实践中，将获得更辉煌的成就。
