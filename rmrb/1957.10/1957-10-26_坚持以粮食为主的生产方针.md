Adhere to the Production Policy of Taking Grain as the Key Link
Hong Yezi, First Secretary of the Longxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Fujian Province

“Abundant harvests of the five grains, flourishing livestock.” That’s how farmers describe the bumper harvest in the Longxi area in 1956. In this first year of advanced cooperativization, the total grain output of the entire area reached more than 1.58 billion catties, an increase of 62.8% over 1949, exceeding the target for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan by 9%. The average grain yield per mu in Longxi County, Haicheng County, and Zhangzhou City has exceeded the 800-catty standard required by the Draft National Agricultural Development Program, and most agricultural cooperatives have also caught up with or exceeded the production level of local well-to-do middle peasants.

In that year, 92% of the agricultural cooperatives in the area increased production, and 83.8% of the farmers increased their income (another 8% of the farmers' income remained the same); the state's grain purchase tasks were overfulfilled, and there was a surplus in unified sales; the farmers' retained grain (including feed and seeds, the same below) averaged 726 catties per person, an increase of 195 catties compared with 1955. The Liming Agricultural Cooperative, which had the highest yield, had 779 catties per person, and 95% of the members had surplus grain. In Longxi County, the "thousand-catty rice county," farmers retained as much as 800 catties of grain per person. Due to the abundant harvests, a prosperous scene of flourishing livestock and rapidly improving living standards appeared in the countryside. The number of live pigs in the area increased to 620,000 this year (an increase of 42.2% compared with 1953), the number of draught cattle reached 245,000 (an increase of 25% compared with 1953), and the number of chickens and ducks increased more than four times compared with 1953. Farmers describe the changes in their lives by saying: "Before liberation, we wore patched clothes, ate preserved vegetables with every meal, lived in houses where the rain dripped like drums, and went out with nothing.” Now, we have surplus grain at home, live in tile-roofed houses, wear khaki clothes, and have more pens than hoes!” These are the benefits that advanced cooperativization has brought to the peasants, and the result of adhering to the production policy of taking grain as the key link.

We have adhered to and implemented the production policy of taking grain as the key link in four aspects.

Persistently Carry Out Political and Ideological Education

This is the fundamental issue in implementing the production policy. The implementation of this policy is essentially a struggle between two management policies, a concrete reflection of the struggle between two lines of thought in the direction of production. Last year, some agricultural cooperatives emphasized "output value" and neglected grain "output"; after some grain-deficient cooperatives became surplus-grain cooperatives, they also wanted to reduce grain planting and proposed a management policy of "growing whatever is valuable." The order they arranged was: first fruits, second vegetables, third sideline occupations, and fourth grain. "The government puts grain first, and we put RMB first." In the early season of this year, farmers in Longxi County converted more than 4,000 mu of grain fields to grow other crops, and individual agricultural cooperatives in Hua'an County valued sideline occupations and disliked agriculture. Under the pretext of reducing costs, they did not apply the chemical fertilizers that should have been applied. The upper-middle peasants of Shangdun, Caihang, and other agricultural cooperatives in Longxi County even organized a group to abandon agriculture and engage in commerce, carrying out speculative activities, sending people to Shanghai and Guangzhou for long periods, transporting agricultural products out, and buying back Western medicines and MSG to profit from them. Some people have become "old Beijingers" and "Shenyang experts." In order to correct this situation, leaders at all levels firmly established the concept of taking grain as the key link, and all relevant departments supported agricultural production with grain as the key link. When guiding farmers in production, they did not simply compare the profits of grain and various crops, but educated farmers to recognize the political significance of grain production in relation to the lives of the entire people, industrialization, and coastal defense struggles, which is especially important in surplus-grain areas, multi-crop areas, and fruit areas. Last year, Jiu Feng District of Pinghe County had a bumper harvest, and farmers wanted to relax grain production. After calculating the production accounts and needs accounts, the entire district would need to increase the supply of 860,000 catties of grain for the population and feed this year, but only planned to increase production by 670,000 catties this year. Everyone was shocked and said: "We don't know the situation if we don't calculate, it's really terrible if we do. If we don't calculate at the beginning of the year, we'll have to eat sand at the end of the year. Where will the grain come from to support industrialization?"

Capitalist ideas exist not only among ordinary peasants, but also among some Party and League members and cooperative cadres. In the entire area, 1,974 Party members in 662 cooperatives are engaged in commercial activities. The results of an investigation of 452 Party members in the county and district of Longxi County showed that 38% did not implement state plans, suppressed output, and engaged in speculative purchases of state-controlled commodities. The Gongnong Agricultural Cooperative in Longxi County even proposed three measures to increase income: restoring the free market for cotton cloth, requesting the state to supply 100,000 catties of wheat to make maltose cakes, and transporting agricultural products for sale outside. The branch and district committee both approved it, but it was stopped by the county committee later. The solution to the above problems is mainly to criticize capitalist ideas from within the Party to outside the Party, and at the same time, strengthen the coordination between state-owned, supply and marketing, commercial, and service departments, plug loopholes, strictly manage the market, and crack down on the speculative activities of illegal merchants and landlord-rich peasant elements. Longxi County did this and the effect was good.

We must patiently persuade farmers to obey the state's grain planting area plan and correctly handle the relationship between the state plan and the independence of agricultural cooperative management. Xiandu Township in Hua'an did not do this, only caring about output and not area. As a result, the early season production was reduced by 50,000 catties, and each person received 57 catties less grain, which made the farmers extremely dissatisfied. Of course, relying solely on plan control is not enough. We should also take various measures and formulate various policies to allow agricultural cooperatives certain management independence.

Overall Planning According to Local Conditions

Pure agricultural townships account for 50.9% of the Longxi area, townships with agriculture as the main industry and other production accounting for 20%-30% account for 33.3%, and townships with forestry, fishery, fruit, sideline occupations, salt as the main industries account for only 15.8%. Whether from the perspective of solving the capital of agricultural cooperatives, supplying raw materials to industry, improving farmers' lives, or from the superior subtropical climate and the farmers' favorable conditions for multiple operations, it is very necessary to comprehensively develop the production of forestry, fruits, fisheries, livestock, tea, sideline occupations, salt, and subtropical crops under the premise of ensuring that the grain fields are not reduced and the total grain output is not affected. Doing so will not only not affect grain production, but will promote agricultural production and is conducive to adhering to the policy of taking grain as the key link. Last year, the Liming Agricultural Cooperative did this and created a large-area high-yield record of 1,455 catties per mu on more than 7,000 mu of land, completed the state's grain purchase task of 6.1 million catties, and the three households with the highest income of cooperative members each earned 1,400 yuan, and 22 households earned more than 700 yuan. The current situation of this cooperative is: many pigs, fat fish, herds of cattle and sheep, and peach, plum, citrus, and pineapple trees cover the hillsides.

Grasp the Two Key Points

There have been droughts here every year for four years. The drought in 1954 reduced production by more than 100 million catties. In the past two years, we have concentrated manpower and material resources to vigorously build farmland water conservancy projects, basically eliminating drought disasters on 600,000 mu of land, and improving irrigation on 700,000 mu of land, which played a significant role in increasing production last year and fighting drought this year. However, there are still nearly 800,000 mu of farmland threatened by drought disasters and 360,000 mu prone to water disasters. We must continue to implement the policy of "cooperatives taking the lead with government assistance" and "small-scale projects as the main focus" in developing water conservancy, assign special personnel to be responsible, and give full play to the role of "local experts" (about two to three people in each township) in order to strive to basically eliminate drought disasters within five to seven years, eliminate water disasters within seven to nine years, and achieve irrigation facilities for most of the cultivated land within twelve years, and make irrigated fields achieve self-flow or pumped irrigation as much as possible.

Last year, 22 mu of "double thousand-catty" rice fields appeared in the entire area. In addition to the good technical reforms, the main reason was sufficient fertilizer, with the amount of fertilizer applied exceeding that of ordinary fields by more than one time. This shows that increasing fertilizer application in high-yield areas can greatly increase unit output. However, the situation of insufficient fertilizer has become prominent with the development of comprehensive production. How to solve this problem? On the one hand, we are taking local conditions into account, taking materials locally, going up the mountains and down to the sea, accumulating more soil fertilizer, using more green manure, raising more pigs, promoting the return of rice stalks to the fields, and combining regular fertilizer accumulation with surprise fertilizer accumulation; on the other hand, due to the insufficient supply of chemical fertilizers, we promptly inform the masses of the difficulties and the possible quantities that can be supplied, mobilize them to actively find ways to accumulate more fertilizer, and at the same time concentrate the chemical fertilizers on high-yield areas, stable-yield areas, and commonly used areas.

    坚持以粮食为主的生产方针
    中共福建省龙溪地委第一书记　洪椰子
    “五谷丰登，六畜兴旺。”农民们这样形容龙溪地区1956年的丰收景象。在这高级合作化的第一年，全区粮食总产量达十五亿八千余万斤，比1949年增产62.8％，超过了第一个五年计划最后一年指标9％。龙溪县、海澄县、漳州市粮食每亩平均产量已超过全国农业发展纲要草案所要求的八百斤标准，多数农业社也已赶上或超过当地富裕中农的生产水平。
    在这一年，全区有92％的农业社增产，83.8％的农户增加收入（还有8％的农户收入不增不减）；国家征购任务超额完成，统销量也有节余；农民留粮（包括饲料、种子，下同）每人平均七百二十六斤，比1955年增加一百九十五斤。产量最高的黎明农业社每人为七百七十九斤，95％的社员家有余粮。水稻千斤县——龙溪县农民每人留粮高达八百斤。由于丰产丰收，农村中出现了六畜兴旺，人民生活水平迅速提高的繁荣气象。全区今年生猪增加到六十二万头（比1953年增长42.2％），耕牛二十四万五千头（比1953年增长25％），鸡鸭比1953年增长四倍多。农民描绘生活的变化说：“解放前身穿几百块（破衣），三餐配菜补（菜干），住房是下雨叮咚鼓，出日画龙虎；现在是家有余粮，住有瓦房，穿有卡叽，钢笔比锄头还多！”这是高级合作化带给农民的好处，是坚持以粮食为主的生产方针的结果。
    我们是从四个方面来坚持，贯彻以粮食为主的生产方针的。
    坚持不懈地进行政治思想教育
    这是贯彻生产方针的根本问题。这一方针的贯彻实质上是两种经营方针的斗争，是思想上两条道路的斗争在生产方向上的具体反映。去年，部分农业社强调了“产值”，忽视了粮食“产量”；某些缺粮社变余粮社后，也想减种粮食，提出“什么值钱就种什么”的经营方针，他们排列的顺序是：一水果、二蔬菜、三副业、四粮食。“政府是粮食第一，我们是人民币第一。”今年早季，龙溪县农民曾把四千余亩粮田改种其他作物，华安县个别农业社重副业厌农业，以降低成本为借口，没有把该施的化学肥料施上。龙溪县的上墩、蔡坑等农业社的上中农竟组织一个集团，弃农就商，进行投机活动，派人长驻上海、广州，长途运出农产品，买回西药、味素，从中谋利。有些人已变成“老北京”“沈阳通”了。为了纠正这种情况，各级领导坚定不移地树立以粮食为主的观念，各有关部门都支持以粮食为主的农业生产。在指导农民生产时，不单纯以粮食和各种作物得利多少来对比，而是教育农民认识粮食生产关系到整个人民生活、工业化、海防斗争的政治意义，这在余粮区、多种作物区、水果区尤其重要。平和县九峰区去年丰收，农民想放松粮食生产。经过算生产账和需要账，全区今年人口、饲料要增加供应八十六万余斤，但今年只计划增产六十七万斤，大家这才大吃一惊，说：“账不算不知情，算了真可怕，年头不算，年尾要吃沙，那来粮支援工业化？”
    资本主义思想不仅一般农民有，某些党团员社干部也有。全区有六百六十二个社一千九百七十四个社员从事商业活动。龙溪县在县区四百五十二个党员中检查的结果是：不执行国家计划，压低产量，套购、抢购国家统购收购物资的占38％。龙溪县工农农业社竟提出这样三项增加收入的措施：恢复棉布自由市场，要求国家供应十万斤小麦做麦芽糕，把农产品外运出售。支部、区委都通过和批准了，后来被县委发觉才制止。解决上述问题的办法，主要是从党内到党外批判资本主义思想，同时，加强国营、供销、商业、服务部门之间的配合，堵塞漏洞，严格市场管理，打击不法商人及地主富农分子的投机活动。龙溪县这样做了，效果良好。
      要耐心说服农民服从国家粮食种植面积计划，正确处理国家计划和农业社经营的独立性这两者的关系。华安仙都乡没有这样做，只管产量不管面积，结果早季减产五万斤，每个人口少分五十七斤粮食，农民极为不满。当然，单靠计划控制也不够，还应该采取多种措施，制定各种政策，允许农业社有一定的经营独立性。
    因地制宜全面规划
    龙溪地区纯农业乡占50.9％，以农为主、其他生产占20％—30％的乡，占33.3％，以林、渔、果、副、盐为主的乡才占15.8％。无论从解决农业社资金、给工业供应原料、改善农民生活来说，从优越的亚热带气候和农民善于多种经营的有利条件来说，在保证不缩小粮田，不影响粮食总产量的前提下，全面发展林、果、渔、畜、茶、副、盐及亚热带作物的生产，是十分必要的。这样做，不仅不会影响粮食生产，相反，会促进农业生产，有利于坚持以粮为主的方针。黎明农业社去年这样做的结果，创造了七千多亩每亩产量一千四百五十五斤的大面积丰产纪录，完成国家征购任务六百一十万斤，社员收入最多的三户，各收入一千四百元，二十二户收入在七百元以上。现在这个社的情况是：猪多、鱼肥、牛羊成群，桃李、柑桔、凤梨满山坡。
          抓紧两个关键
    四年来这里年年有旱，1954年受旱减产一亿多斤。二年来集中人力、物力大力兴修农田水利，基本上消灭了六十万亩旱灾，改善了七十万亩灌溉，对去年增产及今年抗旱斗争起了重大作用。但现尚有受旱灾威胁的农田近八十万亩，易受水灾的三十六万亩，仍须贯彻“社办公助”和“小型为主”的发展水利方针，确定专人负责，充分发挥“土师父”（每乡大约有二——三人）的作用，以便争取五——七年内基本消灭旱灾，七——九年消灭水灾，十二年内达到绝大部分耕地有灌溉设备，水田尽可能做到自流或抽水灌溉。
    去年全区出现了二十二亩“双千斤”水稻田，除技术改革做得好外，主要是肥足，施肥量超过一般田一倍以上。这说明，高产区多积肥，多施肥，就能大大提高单位产量。但肥料不足的情况随着全面生产的发展而突出起来，这个问题如何解决呢？我们一方面是因地制宜，就地取材，上山下海，多积土肥，多用绿肥，增养毛猪，推广稻秆回田，经常性积肥和突击性积肥相结合；另一方面，由于化学肥料供应不足，便及早把困难和可能供应的数量告诉群众，动员他们积极想办法多积肥，同时把化学肥料比较集中供应于高产区、稳产区、惯用区。
