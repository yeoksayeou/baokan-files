The following is a report from our Moscow correspondent on the 19th: The Soviet Minister of Health, Ms. Kovrigina, spoke to reporters about the achievements of the Soviet Union's healthcare undertakings over the past forty years:

The Communist Party and the Soviet government have always cared about the people's health. A unified national healthcare system has been established in our country, with the main principles being: the national nature, unity, and planned nature of healthcare; the universality and free provision of medical care; the close integration of science and practice; and a focus on prevention.

Due to the continuous strengthening of the country's economic strength, the further improvement of the material well-being and culture of the residents, and the constant attention of the Party and the government to healthcare work, the health of the Soviet people has been greatly improved. The level of healthcare work, the mortality rate of residents, and the incidence of disease are all incomparable to those before the revolution.

Before the revolution, the state of health in Russia was very low. In 1913, the national population mortality rate was 30.2 per thousand, far exceeding that of other major capitalist countries. Now, the mortality rate of the Soviet population is 7.5 per thousand, which is the lowest compared to other countries, while in terms of population birth rate and growth indicators, the Soviet Union is one of the largest.

Due to the health and epidemic prevention measures and medical prevention activities taken by health authorities, the proportion of residents suffering from infectious diseases has been greatly reduced. During the Soviet era, several infectious diseases (such as plague, cholera, smallpox, and relapsing fever) have been completely eradicated. The incidence of typhoid fever has been reduced to one-twelfth of what it was before. In 1913, the incidence of malaria was 216.6 per 10,000 residents, which decreased to 0.65 in 1956.

Healthcare construction carried out in accordance with the national economic development plan, and the continuous increase in investment in resident healthcare measures, ensured a huge increase in medical institutions and cadres in a short period.

The number of hospital beds increased from 207,300 in 1913 to 1,432,000 in 1957; the number of doctors (excluding dentists and military doctors) increased from 23,100 to 346,000; the number of doctors per 10,000 people increased from one to seventeen, and the number of beds increased from thirteen to seventy.

The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in the number of doctors per capita.

The thorough implementation of Lenin's national policy has eliminated national inequality and ensured the prosperity of national republics and the development of healthcare.

The work of training medical cadres is also being carried out on a large scale. Before the revolution, there were sixteen schools in Russia that trained doctors. The number of students was about 8,600, and about 1,000 doctors were trained each year. Now, there are seventy-nine schools in the country training doctors and pharmacists. In 1956, the number of students was 152,800, and 16,500 doctors and more than 1,000 pharmacists were trained each year.

In addition to ensuring medical cadres for the healthcare network, the Soviet Union has also solved the problem of implementing a system of doctor specialization and further education. From 1951 to 1955 alone, 76,000 doctors studied in advanced training colleges, 25,200 doctors studied in local training classes, and 8,800 doctors studied in medical colleges. A large number of intermediate medical workers were also trained under the same policy. In 1914, 8,300 people were trained, while in 1956, the number was 194,900.

All activities of healthcare work are closely linked to medicine. In the Soviet Union, this connection is organizationally guaranteed because all medical research institutes and higher medical colleges belong to the Soviet Ministry of Health.

Scientific research work in medicine is coordinated and guided by the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In 1956, in addition to medical colleges, there were 268 specialized scientific institutions conducting this work. There are 28,668 scientific cadres working in the entire healthcare network.

The Soviet Union has opened up broad avenues for women to participate in practical and academic work. The proportion of female doctors in the total number of doctors increased from 10% in 1913 to 75% in 1956.

From the beginning of the establishment of the Soviet regime, the state's first concern was the protection of mothers and children. A broad network of specialized medical and epidemic prevention institutions serving mothers and children has been established in the country.

In addition, seasonal nurseries that can accommodate 2 million children were opened in 1956; summer children's resorts can accommodate 621,000 preschool children, and Young Pioneer summer camps can accommodate more than 5.5 million children; in addition, 1,063 permanent children's sanatoriums were opened, with 106,000 beds; infant homes and mother-infant rooms have 48,200 beds.

Healthcare work for adolescents aged fourteen to eighteen is also the responsibility of the general healthcare network. In addition, specialized adolescent clinics have been opened in hospitals for adolescent workers. In universities, there are clinics serving college students.

Since 1922, the Soviet Union has implemented an annual spring health check for students in primary schools, technical secondary schools, universities, and young people working in factories and other places. This is of great significance for providing correct medical services for this group of residents and implementing healthcare measures.

Resorts and sanatoriums are of great significance for improving the health of residents. Approximately 5 million Soviet people are treated and recuperated in sanatoriums and resorts every year. There are now more than 3,000 sanatoriums and resorts in the Soviet Union, with 448,000 beds. The cost of recuperation at sanatoriums is only 30% borne by employees, and the remaining 70% is paid by the trade union. Children, disabled veterans of the Patriotic War, and patients with pulmonary tuberculosis receive free medical treatment in sanatoriums, which is paid for by the state budget.

The focus on prevention and public health measures plays a major role in the Soviet healthcare system. The implementation of public health measures is stipulated by health legislation and supervised by the state's health inspection authorities.

All health and epidemic prevention measures are implemented by specialized health and epidemic prevention organizations and the network of medical prevention and treatment institutions under their leadership.

The reason why the Soviet Union has been able to achieve such great achievements in healthcare in forty years is entirely due to the Communist Party and the Soviet regime's constant concern for the health of the working people. The achievements of the Soviet people in economic and cultural construction have created all the prerequisites for further improving the people's health.

    关怀劳动人民的健康无微不至
    苏联大力发展卫生事业
    按人口比例的医生数目苏联占世界首位
    本报莫斯科19日电  苏联卫生部部长科夫里金娜向记者谈了苏联卫生事业四十年来的成就如下：
    共产党和苏维埃政府，一向关怀人民的健康。在我国建立了统一的国家保健制度，主要原则是：保健的国家性、统一性和计划性、医疗的普及和不收费用，科学同实践的密切结合以及预防的方针。
    由于国家经济实力的不断增强，居民物质福利和文化的进一步提高，以及党和政府经常关怀卫生保健工作，大大增进了苏联人民的健康。卫生保健工作的水平、居民的死亡率、患病率，都是革命前所不可比拟的。
    革命前俄国的卫生状况，水平十分低。1913年全国人口的死亡率为千分之三十点二，大大超过了其它主要资本主义国家。现在，苏联人口的死亡率是千分之七点五，同其它国家相比是最低的，而就人口的出生率和增长的指标来说，苏联是最大之中的一个。
    由于卫生机关采取了卫生和防疫措施以及医疗预防活动，居民患传染病的比例大大降低了。在苏维埃政权年代里，有几种传染病（如鼠疫、霍乱、天花、回归热）已完全扑灭，伤寒患病率已减低到以前的十二分之一，1913年一万个居民中疟疾患病率为二一六点六，到1956年降低为零点六五。
    按全国国民经济发展计划进行的卫生保健建设，以及居民保健措施方面投资的不断增加，在短时期内确保了医疗机关和干部的巨大增长。
    病床数从1913年的二十万七千三百张增加到1957年的一百四十三万二千张；医生（不包括牙科医生和军医）则从二万三千一百人增加到三十四万六千人；每一万人中的医生数目，已从一人增加到十七人，病床从十三张增加到七十张。
    按人口比例的医生数，苏联占世界第一位。
    列宁民族政策的彻底实现，消灭了民族的不平等，保证了民族共和国的繁荣及卫生事业的发展。
    培养医务工作干部的工作也大规模进行着。在革命前的俄国有十六个培养医生的学校。就学人数约八千六百人，每年造就的医生大约一千人。现在，国内有七十九所学校在培养医生和药剂师。1956年在学人数为十五万二千八百人，每年造就出一万六千五百名医生和一千多药剂师。
    除了确保卫生保健事业网的医疗干部外，苏联还解决了实行医生专业化和进修制度。仅在1951年至1955年内，在进修学院进修的医生就有七万六千人，在各地进修班学习的医生有两万五千二百人，在各医学院进修的医生有八千八百人。在同样方针下也培养了大批中级的医务工作干部。1914年培养了八千三百人，而在1956年则为十九万四千九百人。
    卫生保健工作的全部活动都是同医学密切联系在一起的。在苏联这种联系是有组织保证的，因为所有的医学研究所和高等医科院校都属于苏联卫生部。
    医学方面的科学研究工作，是由苏联科学院主席团统筹安排并加以指导的。1956年，除各医学院外，还有二百六十八个专门的科学机关来进行这一工作。在整个卫生保健事业网中工作的科学干部有二万八千六百六十八人。
    苏联为妇女参加实际工作和学术工作，开辟了广泛的道路。女医生在医生总数中所占比例，从1913年的10％增加到1956年的75％。
    从苏维埃政权建立之初起，国家首先关怀的就是保护母亲和孩子。国内建立了一个广泛的为母亲和孩子服务的专门医疗防疫机关网。
    此外，在1956年开辟了可容二百万个儿童的季节托儿所；夏季儿童避暑地可容六十二万一千个学龄前儿童，少先队夏令营则可容五百五十万以上的儿童；此外开辟了一千零六十三个常年的儿童疗养院，有十万六千个床位；婴儿之家和母子室有四万八千二百个床位。
    对十四岁到十八岁的青少年的保健工作，也由总的卫生保健网负责。此外，在医院里还为青少年工人开辟了专门的青少年医务室。在各高等院校，设有为大学生服务的医务所。
    苏联从1922年起对小学、技术专科学校、高等院校的学生和在工厂等处工作的青年，实行每年一度的春季健康检查。这对为这一阶层居民进行正确的医疗服务，以及实行保健措施，具有重大的意义。
    避暑地和疗养院，对于增进居民的健康，具有重大的意义。每年在疗养院和休养所治疗和休养的苏联人大约五百万左右。现在苏联有三千多个疗养院和休养所，床位达四十四万八千张。赴疗养院的疗养费用，只由职工负担30％，其余的70％由工会开支。儿童、卫国战争的残废军人、肺结核患者在疗养所就医是免费的，它由国家预算中开支。
    预防的方针和公共卫生措施，在苏联卫生保健制度中占主要地位。公共卫生措施的实行，是由卫生立法来规定的，并由国家的卫生检查机关予以监督。
    全部的卫生和防疫措施是由专门的卫生防疫组织及其领导下的医疗防治机关网来实现的。
    苏联在四十年内所以能取得这样大的卫生保健方面的成就，完全是由于共产党和苏维埃政权经常关怀劳动人民的健康。而苏联人民在经济和文化建设中的成就，为进一步改善人民的健康状况，创造了一切前提。
