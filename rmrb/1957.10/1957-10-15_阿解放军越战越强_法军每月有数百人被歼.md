　　Algerian Liberation Army Grows Stronger in Battle
    Hundreds of French Troops Annihilated Monthly

    Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: Algiers Dispatch: The Algerian National Liberation Army has engaged in a series of major battles with French colonial troops in Algeria in recent days.

    According to Western news agency reports, an officer at French military headquarters stated that between two hundred and four hundred French troops are killed in action in Algeria each month.

    Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: The American magazine "Newsweek" recently published a dispatch reporting on the predicament of the French invading forces in Algeria, caught in a dilemma.

    The dispatch described the Algerian National Liberation Army’s combat activities, saying that they operate in groups of eight to thirty, emerging from the mountains or other concealed locations to "ambush French patrols, attack isolated strongholds, and blow up railways (averaging ten acts of sabotage per month on the Bone-Tébessa line). They strike hard and then disappear, vanishing back into the fields."

    The dispatch continued, stating that despite the French Resident Minister in Algeria, Robert Lacoste, often saying that the "pacification" movement has entered its "final stage," the Algerian National Liberation Army is, in fact, growing stronger in battle. Their strength has increased from an initial three thousand to the current twenty-five thousand, with an additional twenty thousand "non-full-time" fighters recruited. "Their weapons, initially only several hundred old hunting rifles, now include sufficient German Mausers and Italian Stetti submachine guns, Bazooka rocket launchers, mortars, and landmines. Simultaneously, 10% to 25% of their weapons are captured from the French."

    The dispatch said that as the cost of the war continues to rise, and as reports about France's actions in Algeria cause serious alarm in France, the will to continue such a seemingly hopeless struggle is gradually waning. Even someone like de Gaulle has recently had to admit that Algerian independence is inevitable.

　　阿解放军越战越强
    法军每月有数百人被歼
    据新华社14日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放军同法国殖民军队连日在阿尔及利亚进行了一系列较大的战斗。
    据西方通讯社报道，法军总部一军官说：在阿尔及利亚的法国军队每月有二百到四百人战死。
    据新华社14日讯　美国“新闻周刊”不久前刊载了一篇通讯，报道法国侵略军在阿尔及利亚进退维谷的窘态。
    通讯描写阿尔及利亚民族解放军的作战活动说，他们八人至三十人地成股由山上或其他隐蔽场所出动，“伏击法国的巡逻队，进攻孤立的据点，炸毁铁路（在波尼—德培萨干线上平均每月有十次破坏）。他们狠狠地打了以后就不见了，又消失在田野里。”
    通讯接着说，尽管法国驻阿尔及利亚的驻节部长罗伯·拉戈斯特常常说“绥靖”运动已经进入“最后阶段”，但是，事实上阿尔及利亚民族解放军越战越强。他们的实力已经由最初的三千人增加到目前的两万五千人，另外还招募了两万名“非专职的”战士。“他们的武器，最初只有数百枝陈旧的猎枪，现在拥有足够的德国毛瑟和意大利斯塔提式的冲锋枪，纳娃式火箭发射器，迫击炮和地雷。同时他们的武器中有10％到25％是从法国人那里缴获来的。”
    通讯说，当战争的代价不断上升，当有关法国在阿尔及利亚的行动的报道在法国引起了严重的惊惶时，要继续这样一个常常看来是毫无希望的斗争的意志已逐渐减退。连戴高乐这样的人最近也不得不承认，阿尔及利亚的独立是不可避免的。
