Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 1st. Representatives from all walks of life in Moscow held a grand gathering in the Column Hall of the House of Trade Unions on the evening of September 30 to celebrate China's National Day.

The celebration was jointly organized by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Soviet Ministry of Culture.

The Column Hall was brightly lit, and the corridors were hung with pictures illustrating China's construction achievements over the past eight years. On the rostrum hung the national flags of China and the Soviet Union and banners written in Chinese and Russian: "Long Live the Fraternal and Unbreakable Friendship and Cooperation Between the Soviet and Chinese Peoples!"

More than 1,000 people attended the conference, including Soviet Minister of Culture Mikhailov, Soviet Minister of Higher Education Yelyutin, Secretaries of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions Gulyayev and Shevchenko, Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fedrin, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Popova, Soviet military generals, representatives of mass and social organizations, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union.

The conference was presided over by Gulyayev. After the opening remarks, Satyukov, editor-in-chief of "Pravda," gave a report on the 8th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Satyukov said,

The Soviet people firmly believe that under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, the Chinese people will successfully solve the greater tasks of building a socialist society that they face and build their motherland into a prosperous and strong country.

Satyukov pointed out that the victory of the Chinese revolution and the outstanding achievements made by the Chinese people in peaceful construction labor vividly demonstrate the great power of Marxism-Leninism. As the Soviet people prepare to welcome the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, they celebrate the 8th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and deeply appreciate the great work done by the fraternal Chinese Communist Party in the past and present in publicizing the historic significance of the October Revolution to the fate of the oppressed nations of the East, to the fate of the Chinese people, and to the fate of the entire international communist movement. The founding of the People's Republic of China played a decisive role in changing the balance of power between socialism and capitalism on the international stage. The victory of the Chinese people has inspired the people of the East to strive for national independence and freedom and to eliminate the colonial system of imperialism; it has made millions of working people around the world rejoice. In a short period of time, the Chinese people have carried out earth-shaking economic and social reforms, and are advancing rapidly on the road to transforming a backward agricultural country into a powerful, industrialized socialist country.

Satyukov emphasized that the Communist Party is the leading force of the Chinese people. Like the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China strongly demonstrated the ever-strengthening unity of the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of all countries, and the victory of the idea of proletarian internationalism. The 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was a major event in the history of the international workers' movement.

He emphasized that the Chinese Communist Party creatively applied Marxism-Leninism, proceeded from actual conditions, and took into account the current and future interests and demands of the masses of the people when solving the complex task of building a socialist society. Satyukov pointed out that the anti-socialist remarks of bourgeois rightists in China have been resolutely resisted by millions of people. Soviet public opinion, like that of other socialist countries, attaches great importance to and is extremely interested in studying the new contributions of the Chinese Communists to the theory and practice of socialist construction.

Satyukov said that the People's Republic of China plays a significant role in international relations. The US government's stubborn protection of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and its refusal to recognize the legitimate rights of the true representatives of 600 million people has aroused protests and anger from the Soviet people and peace-loving people around the world. The Soviets are convinced that the truth will eventually prevail and that China's legitimate rights in the United Nations will be restored. There is no doubt that this will help improve the international atmosphere and consolidate world peace.

Satyukov pointed out that in the past eight years, the relations between China and the Soviet Union, like the relations between all socialist countries, have been continuously strengthened and developed. The Soviet people are studying with great interest the rich experience of the fraternal Chinese people. The Soviet people are deeply convinced that under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, the Chinese people will successfully solve the huge tasks of building a socialist society that they face and build their motherland into a prosperous and strong country.

Ambassador Liu Xiao said,

When the Chinese people are celebrating their National Day, they are also welcoming the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution with the same joyful mood. The light of the October Revolution has illuminated the common path of the proletariats of all countries.

Ambassador Liu Xiao then spoke at the conference. He said that in the past eight years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have made great achievements in all aspects. In particular, 1956 to 1957, whether from the economic front or from the ideological and political front in terms of transformation and construction, can be said to be a year of great transformation significance for new China. It has written a glorious page in the history of our country's transition period for striving for the overall victory of the entire socialist revolution. The great achievements of the new China in the past eight years and the resolute counterattacks given by the united people of the whole country have shattered and continue to shatter the restoration conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists, thereby consolidating the leadership of the proletariat in all aspects of national life, improving the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of people, and providing favorable conditions for further consolidating our country's socialist economic system and political system.

Liu Xiao pointed out that China's achievements and victories are inseparable from the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the assistance of socialist countries, and also from the sympathy and support of all peace-loving countries and people in the world. He then represented the Chinese government and the Chinese people in expressing once again their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people for this comprehensive, systematic, sincere and huge assistance.

Ambassador Liu Xiao said that although the Chinese revolution has its own many characteristics, the Chinese people regard their revolutionary cause as a continuation of the great October Revolution. When the Chinese people are celebrating their National Day, the Chinese people are also welcoming the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution with the same joyful mood. The light of the October Revolution has illuminated the common path of the proletariats of all countries. The great achievements of the Soviet people over the past forty years are invaluable wealth in the cause of human progress. The achievements and experience of the Soviet people will always encourage the Chinese people to forge ahead in revolution and construction, and will also encourage progressive people all over the world to fight for a new life of peace, democracy, freedom, and happiness. Holding high the glorious banner of the October Revolution, defending the common path of the October Revolution, adhering to the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, and constantly consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the working people all over the world are issues related to the fundamental interests of our people and the people of the world, and are also the lofty internationalist obligations of our people.

Liu Xiao finally said that the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union has greatly developed in the past eight years. In the test of the historical torrents of international struggle and the workers' movement, the friendly unity of our two peoples is as solid as a rock and as close as brothers. We are convinced that, on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, the great friendship of the 800 million people of our two countries, consolidated for common ideals and common interests, will last forever and never change in the cause of safeguarding world peace and promoting human progress.

The speeches by Satyukov and Liu Xiao were constantly interrupted by warm applause from the audience.

A grand performance was held after the meeting. (Attached picture)

    中苏两国人民的友谊和合作万岁！
    莫斯科盛大庆祝我国国庆
    新华社莫斯科1日电  莫斯科各界代表9月30日晚间在工会大厦圆柱大厅举行盛大集会，庆祝中国国庆节。
    这次庆祝大会是由全苏工会中央理事会、苏联对外文化协会、苏联文化部联合举办的。
    圆柱大厅灯火辉煌，走廊两旁挂满了说明中国八年来建设成就的图片。主席台上悬挂着中苏两国国旗和用中、俄文书写的标语：“苏中两国人民兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊和合作万岁！”
    参加大会的有苏联文化部长米哈伊洛夫、苏联高等教育部长叶留金、全苏工会中央理事会书记古烈耶夫和谢夫钦科、苏联外交部副部长费德林、苏联对外文化协会理事会主席波波娃、苏军将领、群众和社会团体代表，以及各国驻苏联外交使节一千余人。
    大会由古烈耶夫主持开幕后，由“真理报”总编辑萨丘科夫作了关于中华人民共和国成立八周年的报告。
    萨丘科夫说
    苏联人民深深相信，中国人民在光荣的共产党领导下必将顺利地解决他们所面临的建设社会主义社会的更大任务，把自己的祖国建设为繁荣富强的国家。
    萨丘科夫指出，中国革命的胜利和中国人民在和平建设劳动中所取得的杰出成就，鲜明地证明了马克思列宁主义思想的强大力量。苏联人民在准备迎接伟大的十月革命四十周年的日子里庆祝中华人民共和国成立八周年，并且深深感激兄弟的中国共产党过去和现在在宣传十月革命对东方被压迫民族的命运、对中国人民和整个国际共产主义运动的命运的历史性意义方面所进行的巨大工作。中华人民共和国的成立在改变国际舞台上社会主义和资本主义力量的对比方面起了决定性的作用。中国人民的胜利鼓舞了东方人民为争取民族独立和自由、争取消灭帝国主义的殖民主义体系而奋斗；使全世界千百万劳动人民欢欣鼓舞。在短短的时期内，中国人民进行了翻天复地的经济和社会改革，一日千里地在把落后的农业国变为强大的、工业化的社会主义国家的道路上前进。
    萨丘科夫强调指出，共产党人是中国人民的领导力量。像苏联共产党第二十次代表大会一样，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会强有力地显示了各国共产党和工人党的团结一致不断加强，显示了无产阶级国际主义思想的胜利。中国共产党第八次全国代表大会是国际工人运动史上的重大事件。
    他着重指出，中国共产党创造性地运用马克思列宁主义，在解决建设社会主义社会这个复杂任务时，从实际情况出发，考虑到人民群众今天的和未来的利益和要求。萨丘科夫指出，资产阶级右派分子的反社会主义言论在中国遭到了千千万万人民一致的坚决反击。苏联公众和其他社会主义国家的公众一样，十分重视和极感兴趣地研究中国共产党人对社会主义建设的理论和实践的新贡献。
    萨丘科夫说，中华人民共和国在国际关系中起着重大的作用。美国政府顽固地庇护蒋介石匪帮，不承认六亿人民的真正代表的合法权利，这种蛮不讲理的态度引起了苏联人民和全世界爱好和平的公众的抗议和愤怒。苏联人深信，真理最后必定胜利，中国在联合国的合法权利必将恢复。毫无疑问，这将有助于改善国际气氛和巩固世界和平。
    萨丘科夫指出，过去八年中，中苏两国的关系，像一切社会主义国家之间的关系一样，不断地加强和发展了。苏联人满怀兴趣地学习兄弟中国人民的丰富经验。苏联人民深深相信，中国人民在光荣的共产党的领导下必将顺利地解决他们所面临的建设社会主义社会的巨大任务，把自己的祖国建成为繁荣富强的国家。
    刘晓大使说
    当中国人民在欢庆自己的国庆节的时候，也怀着同样愉快的心情迎接十月社会主义革命四十周年。十月革命的光芒照亮了各国无产阶级的共同道路。
    刘晓大使接着在大会上讲了话。他说，八年来，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下在各方面都取得了巨大的成就。特别是1956年到1957年，不论从经济战线上或者从政治思想战线上的变革和建设来看，都可以说是新中国的具有伟大转变意义的一年。它在我国争取整个社会主义革命全面胜利的过渡时期的历史上写下了光辉的一页。新中国八年来的巨大成就和全国人民团结一致所给予的坚决反击，粉碎了和继续粉碎着资产阶级右派分子的复辟阴谋，从而在国家生活的各方面巩固了无产阶级的领导，提高了广大人民的社会主义觉悟，为进一步巩固我国的社会主义经济制度和政治制度提供了有利的条件。
    刘晓指出，中国的成就和胜利是同苏联兄弟般的无私援助、同社会主义各国的援助、同时也是同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持分不开的。他接着代表中国政府和中国人民再一次对苏联政府和苏联人民这种全面的、系统的、真诚的、巨大的援助表示衷心的感谢。
    刘晓大使说，尽管中国革命有着自己的许多特点，但是中国人民把自己的革命事业看成是伟大十月革命的继续。当中国人民在欢庆自己的国庆节的时候，中国人民也怀着同样的愉快心情迎接十月社会主义革命四十周年。十月革命的光芒照亮了各国无产阶级的共同道路。苏联人民四十年来的伟大成就是人类进步事业中无可估价的财富。苏联人民的成就和经验，永远鼓舞着中国人民勇往直前地进行革命和建设，也鼓舞着全世界进步人类为争取和平民主自由幸福的新生活而斗争。高举十月革命的光辉旗帜、保卫十月革命的共同道路、坚持马克思列宁主义的普遍真理、不断地巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和全世界劳动人民的团结，是有关我国人民和全世界人民根本利益的问题，也是我国人民崇高的国际主义义务。
    刘晓最后说，八年以来中苏两国人民的友谊和合作有了很大的发展。在国际斗争和工人运动的历史洪流的考验中，我们两国人民的友好团结固若金汤、亲如手足。我们确信，在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上，为共同的理想和共同的利益所巩固起来的我们两国八亿人民的伟大友谊，在维护世界和平和促进人类进步的事业中将永世长青，万年不渝。
    萨丘科夫和刘晓的讲话不断被全场热烈的掌声打断。
