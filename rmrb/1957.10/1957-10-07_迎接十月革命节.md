Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th. In the past week, various activities commemorating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution have been enthusiastically unfolding in both urban and rural areas of Vietnam. The commemorative activities, which began at the start of October, will last for approximately a month and a half.

As early as June, a central preparatory committee for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution was established here, followed by the successive establishment of more than thirty provincial and municipal preparatory committees to organize and guide this massive commemorative event.

The Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party began a training class at the beginning of October for 1,200 high- and mid-level party cadres to study the significance and experience of the October Revolution. After a short period of study, many will become political propagandists for commemorative activities in provinces, counties, and townships.

In recent days, various competition movements organized by industrial and mining enterprises and people's organizations in Hanoi and other provinces and cities to welcome this great anniversary have almost all begun.

Hu Chi Minh publishes important article
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th. The "People's Daily" of Vietnam published in full on the 3rd President Ho Chi Minh's long article - "The October Revolution and the Liberation Cause of Eastern Nations". This article was written by Ho Chi Minh to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the great October Revolution.

In this important article, the Vietnamese people's leader expounded the great significance and influence of the October Revolution on the liberation cause of the Eastern nations, particularly the Vietnamese people.

The article pointed out that the final victory of the national liberation movement worldwide is beyond doubt, and the final victory of socialism is fully guaranteed and certain.

Mongolia begins "Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Month"
Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 5th. The Chairman of the Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Association, Dongharzhab, told this agency's reporter that the Mongolian people, in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, will hold a "Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Month" throughout the country starting on October 7th.

Dongharzhab said that the four weeks of the Friendship Month are respectively named: "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Week," "Soviet Medical Week," "October Revolution and Mongolian People's Republic Week," and "Great Socialist October Revolution 40th Anniversary Week." The third and fourth weeks are the focus of the Friendship Month's publicity activities. Because the Russian Republic and Mongolia established friendly relations earlier, and the construction of Soviet industry, culture, etc., has been introduced separately in the past, the first and second weeks will publicize the Russian Republic and Soviet medicine.

He said that during the Friendship Month, newspapers, pictures, and exhibitions will be used to publicize the Soviet Union's construction achievements and Mongolian-Soviet friendship, and mass meetings with Soviet experts in Mongolia will be organized.

Romanian factories launch production competitions
Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 6th. The Romanian people are warmly welcoming the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution.

Currently, socialist labor competitions have been launched in factories, and agricultural collectivization movements have been launched in rural areas. Students in secondary schools are also holding painting and handicraft competitions themed on Romanian-Soviet friendship.

From October 7th, a series of large-scale celebrations will be held in cities and villages throughout Romania, including organizing report meetings on the significance of the October Revolution, the achievements of Soviet culture and science, holding Soviet book, drama, music, and film weeks, as well as holding Romanian-Soviet friendship gatherings and sports competitions.

    越南各地热烈展开纪念活动
    据新华社河内6日电　一周来，越南城乡正在热烈展开纪念十月社会主义革命四十周年的各种活动。纪念活动从10月初起大约将进行一个半月。
    早在6月间，纪念10月革命四十周年的中央筹备委员会已经在这里成立，接着有三十多个省、市筹备委员会相继成立，以组织和指导这个规模巨大的纪念活动。
    越南劳动党中央在10月初开始举办了一个有一千二百名高、中级党员干部参加的在职学习班，学习关于十月革命的意义和经验。经过短期的学习后，许多人将成为省、县和乡纪念活动的政治宣传者。
    近日来，河内和各省市的工矿企业和人民团体为迎接这个伟大的纪念日而组织的各种竞赛运动几乎全部已经开始。
    胡志明主席发表重要文章
    据新华社河内4日电　越南“人民报”3日全文刊登了胡志明主席的长篇文章——“十月革命与东方各民族的解放事业”。这篇文章是胡志明为纪念伟大十月革命四十周年而写的。

    蒙古开始举行“蒙苏友好月”
    据新华社乌兰巴托5日电　蒙苏友好协会主席东哈尔扎布向本社记者说，蒙古人民为庆祝十月革命四十周年，将从10月7日起在全国范围内举行“蒙苏友好月”。
    东哈尔扎布说，友好月的四个星期分别命名为：“俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国周”、“苏联医学周”、“十月革命和蒙古人民共和国周”和“伟大的社会主义十月革命四十周年周”。第三、四周是友好月的宣传活动的重点。因为俄罗斯共和国和蒙古较早地建立了友好关系，而且苏联的工业、文化等的建设情况过去曾经单独介绍过，因此在第一、二周内宣传俄罗斯共和国和苏联医学。
    他说，在友好月里要利用报刊、图片和展览会等方式宣传苏联的建设成就和蒙苏友谊，并且将组织群众和在蒙古的苏联专家会见。
