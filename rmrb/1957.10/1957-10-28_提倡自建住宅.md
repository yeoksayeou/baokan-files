    Advocate Self-Built Housing
    Chen Shaomin
    In recent years, trade unions and administrative leaders in departments such as railways, coal mines, and textiles have helped workers build a considerable number of simple houses using the "self-built with public assistance" method, solving the housing problem for some workers and saving the state a portion of funds. According to incomplete statistics, the railway system built more than 1.2 million square meters from 1954 to 1956, solving the housing problem for 45,000 worker households. During the same period, the coal mining system helped 28,898 worker households build 1,010,552 square meters of housing on their own. The textile sector began assisting workers in building their own homes in 1952. By the end of last year, factories in thirteen provinces and cities had helped workers build 243,343 square meters of housing, and 7,795 worker households had moved into spacious and practical self-built homes. The three industrial systems mentioned above built a total of 2,453,895 square meters, solving the housing problem for 81,693 worker households. Calculated based on the cost of worker dormitories built by the state for these three departments during the same period, this saved the state a total of 139,216,422 yuan. If the Party, government, and trade union leading bodies in various departments can attach importance to the experience of self-built housing in the future, pay attention to organizing the economic strength of the masses, and systematically promote self-built housing, it will meet the housing needs of more workers and save more funds for the country.
    The cost of self-built housing is generally relatively low. For example, in the railway system, it is generally 7 to 15 yuan per square meter, with the lowest being 4 yuan and the highest being 28 yuan. In the coal mining system, it is generally 15 to 18 yuan, with the highest being 20 yuan. The textile sector does not have comprehensive statistics, but it is known that the cost of self-built housing in Qingdao is generally 17 to 23 yuan, with the lowest being 12 yuan and the highest being 25.5 yuan. The two-story buildings built by textile workers in Chongqing cost only 12 yuan per square meter. The benefits of self-built housing are that it costs less, saves materials, is practical, and suits the living habits of the working people. Therefore, workers are willing to build their own homes.
    Since 1952, Qingdao State Cotton Factory No. 6 created the experience of solving housing difficulties through "self-built with public assistance," and has helped workers build their own homes almost every year. By the end of last year, it had built a total of 16,027 square meters (with a living area of 12,781 square meters), meeting the housing needs of 505 worker households, with an average living space of 25.3 square meters per household. The total living area of the dormitories built by the state for this factory after liberation is 6,039 square meters, making self-built housing equivalent to 212% of the new dormitories built by state investment. The family dormitories of this factory total 19,598 square meters, housing a total of 2,024 households (including leading cadres), with an average living space of 9.68 square meters per household. The Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, the Qingdao Textile Administration Bureau, and the trade union require all factories to learn from State Cotton Factory No. 6 and strongly support the factories. By the end of 1956, just twelve factories had built 62,744 square meters of housing (with a living area of 48,129 square meters), housing 2,089 households, with an average living space of 23 square meters per household. The total number of family dormitories in these twelve factories is 135,953 square meters, housing a total of 11,136 households, including leading cadres, with an average of 12.2 square meters per household. Compared with dormitories built with state investment, self-built housing is obviously more spacious and comfortable. Workers cherish their own homes and keep them very clean. Sanitary models among workers' families are found in self-built residential areas. Although self-built housing still has many shortcomings, and workers still have some opinions, they are willing to build their own homes, only complaining that what has been built for them is not satisfactory enough. The number of people requesting self-built housing is increasing. Workers would rather save on food and use less in order to prepare money to build their own homes. This is the urgent demand of ordinary workers in various industries, factories, and mining areas.
    Will workers saving money to build their own homes affect their lives? It will have some impact. However, Chinese workers suffered oppression, exploitation, unemployment, and other torments in the old society, and generally developed a habit of thrift and a fine tradition of hard work and simplicity. As long as they have enough grain and vegetables to eat, they save any extra money. Judging from the materials on workers' savings and purchase of public bonds, workers can still save some money to build their own homes. Some workers have considerable bank deposits. For example, in the Shijingshan Power Plant, those who have saved 100 to 1,000 yuan account for 15.9% of the total number of workers; a few have even saved 2,000 yuan. This requires us to constantly carry out political and ideological education to mobilize them to save. However, relying solely on political and ideological work is not enough. We also need to find a way to use their surplus strength and encourage them to save actively. Self-built housing is a good way. The income of textile workers in Qingdao is not higher than that of other regions, and there are many old workers and many children, but they have built so many self-built houses, and the number of people and the amount of money in buying public bonds and depositing in banks are still rising. I believe that building a large number of houses every year is one of the main ways to attract workers to save money.
    Helping workers build their own homes is an extremely specific and meticulous organizational task. Enterprise leaders, especially trade union cadres, should extend their concern for the lives of the masses to the depths of their lives. They must know how much surplus strength the masses have, and have the spirit of hard work and not being afraid of trouble, and organize the masses into this meticulous work. When everyone thinks of ideas and everyone gathers money, it will "accumulate little into much" and solve the urgent problems of the masses. The insufficient portion is provided by banks or administrative loans, which are paid off regularly. It is appropriate and correct for the coal mining union to lend 3 million yuan of its savings to workers for self-built housing. The practice of relying solely on enterprise administration and bank loans to build houses and then deduct loan repayments from wages regularly is not following the mass line. This method is not good.
    Everyone is responsible for socialist construction. Working hard in production and running a household thriftily are both socialist construction. Educating workers to consciously turn national plans into their own plans, launching socialist competition, and ensuring the completion of national plans are the main aspects of socialist construction. Educating workers to save as much as possible and giving play to the strength of the masses to solve problems in their lives is also a part of socialist construction. This is the main task of the trade union and a major part of socialist education. The idea and practice of simply relying on the state to provide money to improve the lives of workers is wrong. The purpose of socialist construction is to improve the people's lives. With the development of socialist construction, workers' incomes are gradually increasing. In a country with a population of 600 million, where the foundation is not strong and industrial consumer goods are not sufficient, if we do not find a way out for the money that can be saved and let it rush around in the market, it will be detrimental to the country and the masses. Constantly educating workers to save and guiding them to use their surplus money in areas that they need most and that are beneficial to socialist construction is one of the important tasks of the trade union.
    The trade union has the responsibility to promote the experience of self-built housing in areas where conditions permit, and to assist the administration in helping workers build their own homes.
    In addition, there are some problems that cannot be solved by the administration and trade unions of factories and mines. For example:
    1.  Urban planning requirements are high. Some areas that have the conditions to build simple houses near factories are not allowed to build by urban management departments. Workers urgently need housing, and the government does not have much money to build high-rise buildings for the masses. Self-built plans cannot be completed, making it difficult for the administration, trade unions, and even the Party committee to explain to the masses.
    2.  Some banks in some areas do not provide loans, and enterprise bonuses are limited, so they cannot all be lent to workers for self-built housing. The coal mining union lends its savings to workers to build houses, and the Qingdao textile union is prepared to lend all of its surplus funds to workers to build houses. But this is "a drop in the bucket" and cannot solve the problem.
    3.  Material issues. There are no material items for self-built housing in the national plan. Some factories and mines cannot complete their self-built housing plans because they cannot get materials.
    4.  Before self-built housing is even completed and loans are repaid, relevant departments come to collect property taxes. Coal miners cannot get bricks to build houses, so they burn their own bricks for their own use, and relevant departments also come to collect brick and tile taxes.
    These problems cannot be solved by the administration and trade unions of enterprises. It is hoped that the State Council will make overall plans and find ways to solve the problems of loans, materials, and land for self-built housing, and support the administration and trade unions of factories and mines to help workers build their own homes in a planned and phased manner. It is hoped that the self-built housing project will be included in the national annual plan so that local governments can handle affairs well. It is suggested that the government not collect property taxes until workers have paid off their loans. It is also hoped that urban planning will be more practical, and that housing standards will be set lower to meet the economic strength and needs of our country and the working people, and to appropriately take care of the living standards and habits of the working people.
    Now, almost 100% of those who build their own homes are old workers from old factories and mines. They save money from their living expenses and build their own homes with the help of the government. Very few management personnel build their own homes. In fact, the average salary of management personnel is higher than that of workers, and they can also save money to build their own homes. If they are transferred to another job, the administration can buy their houses.
    Self-built housing should also be promoted in new factories and mines. A large proportion of the workers in new factories and mines are newly recruited local young people, who have fewer family burdens and families with houses to live in. Therefore, in general, new factories and mines should mainly build single dormitories for new workers; and build a small number of family dormitories for the families of cadres and old workers transferred from other cities. The trade union and administration should educate young workers to pay attention to saving money when they are young and have fewer family burdens, and prepare to build their own homes.

    提倡自建住宅
    陈少敏
    几年来，铁路、煤矿、纺织等部门的工会和行政领导，帮助职工群众用“自建公助”的办法，盖了不少简易住宅，解决了一部分职工的住宅问题，为国家节省了一部分资金。据不完全统计，铁路系统从1954年到1956年共盖了一百二十多万平方公尺，解决了四万五千户职工的住宅问题；煤矿系统在同一时期帮助二万八千八百九十八户职工自建了一百零一万零五百五十二平方公尺的住宅；纺织部门从1952年开始帮助职工自建住宅，到去年年底止，在十三个省、市的一部分工厂中帮助职工自建住宅二十四万三千三百四十三平方公尺，有七千七百九十五户职工住进了宽敞适用的自建的房子。上述三个产业系统共盖了二百四十五万三千八百九十五平方公尺，解决了八万一千六百九十三户职工的住宅问题。按同一时期国家投资为这三个部门建筑的职工宿舍的造价计算，共为国家节省了一亿三千九百二十一万六千四百二十二元。假若各部门党、政、工会领导机关今后都能重视自建住宅的经验，注意组织群众的经济力量，有计划地推广自建住宅，那将会满足更多职工的住宅要求，为国家节省更多的资金。
    自建住宅的造价一般是比较低的。例如：铁路系统一般是七到十五元一平方公尺，最低四元，最高二十八元；煤矿系统一般是十五到十八元，高的二十元。纺织部门没有全面的统计，仅知青岛自建住宅的造价，一般是十七到二十三元，最低十二元，最高二十五点五元；重庆纺织工人盖的两层楼房，才十二元一平方公尺。自建住宅的好处，就是花钱少，省材料，实用，合乎劳动人民的生活习惯。因此，工人愿意自建住宅。
    青岛国棉六厂从1952年创造了“自建公助”解决住宅困难的经验以后，几乎每年都帮助职工自建住宅。到去年年底止，共盖了一万六千零二十七平方公尺（居住面积为一万二千七百八十一平方公尺），满足了五百零五户职工的住宅要求，平均每户居住二十五点三平方公尺。解放后国家投资为这个厂盖的宿舍，居住面积总数是六千零三十九平方公尺，自建住宅相当于国家投资新建宿舍的212％。这个厂眷属宿舍共一万九千五百九十八平方公尺，共住二千零二十四户（包括领导干部），平均每户居住九点六八平方公尺。中共青岛市委、青岛纺织管理局和工会要求各厂向国棉六厂学习，并且大力支持各厂。到1956年底，仅十二个厂就盖了六万二千七百四十四平方公尺住宅（居住面积为四万八千一百二十九平方公尺），住二千零八十九户，平均每户居住二十三平方公尺。这十二个厂的眷属宿舍总数是十三万五千九百五十三平方公尺，连领导干部在内共住了一万一千一百三十六户，平均每户十二点二平方公尺。自建住宅和国家投资建的宿舍比较，显然是自建住宅宽敞些、舒服些。职工们很爱护自己的房子，收拾得很干净，职工家属中的卫生模范就出在自建住宅区。虽然自建住宅还有许多缺点，职工也还有些意见，但是他们愿意自建住宅，仅是嫌给他们盖的还不够合意。要求自建住宅的人越来越多。工人们宁愿节吃少用，也要准备钱自建住宅。这是各产业、各工厂和矿区一般工人的迫切要求。
    职工们节省钱自建住宅，会不会影响生活？会受些影响的。但是，中国工人在旧社会里受尽了压迫、剥削、失业等等折磨，一般都养成了节约的习惯，养成了艰苦朴素的优良传统。只要有粮食、蔬菜吃饱，一有余钱就存起来。从职工群众储蓄、买公债的材料看，职工们还是可以节省些钱自建住宅的。有些职工银行存款相当多，如石景山发电厂，存一百元到一千元的人，占职工总数的15.9％；有少数人还存了两千元。这就需要我们经常地进行政治思想教育，动员他们节约。但是单靠政治思想工作是不够的，还需要找个使用节余力量的出路，吸引他们积极节约。自建住宅就是个好办法。青岛纺织工人的收入并不比其他地区多，而且老工人多，孩子多，但是他们盖了那么多自建住宅，买公债、在银行存款的人数、钱数也还在上升。我认为，他们年年自建大批住宅是吸引职工节省钱的主要方法之一。
    帮助职工自建住宅是一项极其具体、细致的组织工作。企业领导干部，特别是工会干部，应该把关心群众生活深入到群众的生活深处。要知道群众有多大的余力，要有任劳任怨、不怕麻烦的精神，把群众组织到这个细致的工作中来。大家想办法，大家聚集钱，就会“滴水成汪洋”，解决群众的迫切问题。不足部分由银行或行政贷款，定期还清。煤矿工会把节余的三百万元借给职工自建住宅，这是应该的、正确的。那种单靠企业行政和银行贷款，把房子盖好，再定期从工资中扣还贷款的作法，是不走群众路线。这个办法不好。
    社会主义建设，人人有责。努力生产，勤俭持家，都是社会主义建设。教育职工群众自觉地把国家计划变成自己的计划，开展社会主义竞赛，保证完成国家计划是社会主义建设的主要方面；教育职工群众在可能的情况下节约，发挥群众的力量，解决群众生活等方面的问题，也是社会主义建设的一部分。这是工会的主要任务，是社会主义教育的主要部分。单纯依赖国家拿钱改善职工生活的想法和作法是错误的。社会主义建设的目的，是为了改善人民生活。随着社会主义建设的发展，职工的收入是逐渐增加的。在六亿人口的国家里，在家底不丰、工业消费品还不充足的情况下，如不给可以节省的钱找个出路，让它在市场上乱冲，对国家、对群众都是不利的。经常教育职工群众节约，并且引导他们把节余的钱用在他们最需要和对社会主义建设有利的方面，是工会的重要任务之一。
    工会有责任在有条件的地区，推广自建住宅的经验，协同行政帮助职工自建住宅。
    另外，有些问题不是厂矿企业的行政、工会所能解决得了的。例如：
    一、城市规划要求高。有些有条件在工厂附近盖简易住宅的地区，城市管理部门不让盖。职工急需住宅，政府又没有很多钱给职工群众盖高楼大厦，自建计划完成不了，弄得行政、工会，连党委在内都很难对群众解释。
    二、有些地区的银行不给贷款，企业奖金有限，又不能全部借给职工自建住宅。煤矿工会把存款借给职工盖房子，青岛纺织工会准备把节余经费全部借给职工盖房子。但是“杯水车薪”，解决不了问题。
    三、材料问题。国家计划中没有自建住宅的材料项目。有的厂矿因为弄不到材料完不成自建住宅的计划。
    四、自建住宅还没有干，借款还没有还清，有关部门就来收房产税。煤矿工人弄不到砖盖房子，就自己烧砖自己用，有关部门也来收砖瓦税。
    这些问题，都不是企业的行政、工会所能解决的。希望国务院统盘筹划，设法解决自建住宅的贷款、材料、地皮等问题，支持厂矿企业的行政和工会有计划地、分批地帮助职工自建住宅。希望在国家的年度计划中把自建住宅这个项目订进去，各地政府好办事。建议政府在职工还清借款以前不要收房产税。还希望把城市规划订得切合实际些，住宅标准订低点，使之合乎我们国家经济力量和劳动人民的需要，适当地照顾劳动人民的生活水平和习惯。
    现在自建住宅的人，几乎百分之百是老厂矿的老工人，他们是从生活费中节省钱在政府的帮助下自建住宅的。管理人员很少自建住宅的。其实，管理人员的平均工资比工人高，他们也可以节省钱自建住宅。如调动工作，可以由行政收买他们的房子。
    新建厂矿中也应该提倡自建住宅。新建厂矿的工人很大一部分是新招收的本地青年，他们家庭负担较少，家庭又有房子住。所以一般新建厂矿应该主要是建单身宿舍，供新工人住；建少量家属宿舍，供从其他城市调来的干部、老工人的家属住。工会和行政应该教育青年工人，趁年青、家庭负担少的时候注意节省钱，准备自建住宅。
