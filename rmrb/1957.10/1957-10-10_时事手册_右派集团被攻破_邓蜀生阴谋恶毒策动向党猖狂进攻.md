    "Shi Shi Shou Ce" Rightist Clique Smashed
    Deng Shusheng Diabolically Plotted Frenzied Attack on the Party

    (Reported by our newspaper) At the recent sessions of the forum held by the publishing circles in the capital, the core of the rightist clique in the editorial department of "Shi Shi Shou Ce" [Current Affairs Handbook] was smashed.

    The forum revealed that the members of this rightist clique all harbored serious bourgeois individualistic thoughts, yearned for bourgeois democracy, freedom, and a decadent lifestyle; and that Deng Shusheng, an anti-communist expert cloaked in the guise of a Communist Youth League member, was actively spreading these moldy ideas and further plotting anti-Party conspiracies.

    Deng Shusheng (also known as Deng Chao), during the Party's rectification campaign, instigated the "Shi Shi Shou Ce" rightist clique to launch a frenzied attack on the Party.

    Deng Shusheng openly advocated "self-cultivation" and "becoming famous and establishing oneself," promoting these as shortcuts to gaining status, money, and women. He advocated "socialism in work, petty-bourgeoisie in life," urging everyone to don the cloak of "socialism" while actually pursuing a decadent bourgeois lifestyle and engaging in anti-communist and anti-socialist activities. Other members of the "Shi Shi Shou Ce" rightist clique even called this the "Deng Shusheng direction," following suit step by step, discussing salacious news, spreading rumors, and brewing anti-Party activities. In the early stages of the rectification campaign, this rightist clique openly clamored to use "social forces" to coerce the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee and the Ministry of Culture, striving to make "Shi Shi Shou Ce" break away from the Party's leadership and become "independently responsible." According to revelations, the rightist Deng Shusheng was originally a veteran anti-communist expert. As early as 1944, he wrote many articles for the Ta Kung Pao praising the American army. He also frequented Hu Zongnan's residence, specializing in fabricating news and viciously slandering the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. In 1949, in Xi'an, he also served concurrently as the editor-in-chief of "Shi Shi Xinwen" [Current Affairs News], a reactionary newspaper run by Hu Zongnan. When Xi'an was about to be liberated, Deng Shusheng took the last plane to Shanghai. After the liberation of Shanghai, he surreptitiously stamped a seal of the preparatory committee of the Xinmin Pao Trade Union, forged a letter of introduction, and applied for admission to the East China News College, thereby infiltrating the revolutionary ranks. As early as 1954, Deng Shusheng colluded with three other Communist Youth League members to oppose the leadership of the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House over "Shi Shi Shou Ce". The reason why he promoted a decadent bourgeois lifestyle was partly to corrupt people and expand his "ranks," and partly to use this as a cover for his anti-Party activities, gathering forces for his anti-Party conspiracies.

    After exposure, everyone was extremely indignant at the anti-communist expert Deng Shusheng's vicious conspiracies and believed that the "Deng Shusheng direction," which touted "self-cultivation" and "becoming famous and establishing oneself," was a terrible trap that led people to degenerate into anti-Party and anti-socialist elements and must be thoroughly smashed.

### “时事手册”右派集团被攻破  邓蜀生阴谋恶毒策动向党猖狂进攻

    “时事手册”右派集团被攻破
    邓蜀生阴谋恶毒策动向党猖狂进攻
    本报讯　首都出版界座谈会在最近举行的几次会议上，攻破了“时事手册”编辑部右派小集团的核心。
    座谈会揭露，这个右派小集团的成员都存在着严重的资产阶级个人主义思想，向往着资产阶级的民主自由和腐朽生活方式；而积极散布这种发霉的思想、并进而策划反党阴谋的是披着共青团员外衣的反共专家邓蜀生。
    邓蜀生（又名邓超），在党整风期间，策动了“时事手册”右派小集团向党展开了猖狂的进攻。
    邓蜀生公开提倡什么“自我培养”“成名成家”，宣传这是取得地位、金钱、女人的捷径。提倡“工作上是社会主义的，生活上是小资产阶级的”，要大家披起“社会主义”的外衣，实际上追逐资产阶级腐朽的生活方式，干反共反社会主义的勾当。“时事手册”右派小集团其他成员竟称这是“邓蜀生方向”，随之一步一趋，谈论黄色新闻，传播流言蜚语，酝酿反党活动。在整风初期，这个右派小集团就公然叫嚣要借“社会力量”来要挟中宣部和文化部，争取时事手册脱离党的领导，“独立负责”。据揭露，右派分子邓蜀生原来是一个老牌反共专家。1944年就为大公报写过许多捧美国军队的文章。又曾出入于胡宗南之门，专门捏造消息，恶毒地诬蔑共产党和人民解放军。1949年在西安还兼任胡宗南办的反动报纸“时事新闻”的总编辑。西安快要解放时，邓蜀生乘最后一架飞机到了上海。上海解放后，他偷盖了新民报工会筹委会的图章，伪造介绍信投考华东新闻学院，从此混入革命队伍。邓蜀生早在1954年就纠合其他三个共青团员，反对通俗读物出版社对“时事手册”的领导。他之所以宣传腐朽的资产阶级生活方式，一方面是腐蚀人，扩大他的“队伍”，一方面也以此来掩饰他的反党活动，为他的反党阴谋纠集力量。
    经过揭发，大家对反共专家邓蜀生的恶毒阴谋，都异常愤慨，并认为标榜“自我培养”“成名成家”的“邓蜀生方向”，正是一个引导人堕落到反党反社会主义的可怕陷阱，必须予以彻底粉碎。
