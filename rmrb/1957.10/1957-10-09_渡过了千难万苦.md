Having Surmounted Countless Difficulties
By Li He, Our Correspondent

Under the leadership of the heroic Soviet people and the Leninist Communist Party, the first socialist state was established on one-sixth of the Earth's land. This is a great nation where, for the first time in history, laborers have turned over and become masters of society, with everyone having work, food, and education. This is a great nation that, in the short span of forty years of human history, has possessed highly developed socialist industry, agriculture, and culture, surpassing many capitalist countries in economic strength, and mastering amazing scientific technologies such as atomic power plants, synchrophasotrons, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and artificial satellites... These facts cannot be denied even by anti-Soviet elements in capitalist countries. These countless achievements were obtained by the Soviet people through countless arduous struggles.

Soviet comrades have had many cordial conversations with us. Whenever you admire the achievements of the Soviet Union, they always express with emotion: "You must know that the Soviet people, as pioneers of the socialist world, had to blaze trails and build bridges, and repel the encirclement and attacks of enemies single-handedly. Please remember that the Soviet Union was born, grew, and strengthened amidst countless difficulties." These words from the bottom of their hearts remind us that when we recognize, study, and learn from the Soviet Union, we must not deviate from the historical experiences and arduous process of this great nation. Naturally, even the thickest history textbooks cannot record all the great achievements of the Soviet people in creating a new society. Many deeds are scattered in people's memories and in newspapers of the past forty years, and more deeds and nameless heroes are dissolved in the cause and achievements of today's Soviet Union.

From November 1917 to January and February of the following year, the storm of the socialist revolution swept across Russia, and the Soviet regime was established in a vast land with a "triumphant march," and the dictatorship of the proletariat was established. Imperialists, fearing the existence of the Soviet regime, immediately colluded with counter-revolutionary forces within Russia to launch armed intervention and rebellion. The nascent Soviet state was in danger. The workers and peasants stood up to fight. Nearly half of the Party members and Youth League members went to the front lines. People endured hunger, shed blood, and defended the revolutionary regime. During the transition period of the civil war and the restoration of the national economy, the people tightened their belts and fought and worked for several years. When the grain-producing areas of Ukraine and the Don region were occupied by the enemy, workers in Moscow and Petrograd received only one-eighth of a pound of bread every two days, and sometimes none at all. After the end of the civil war, the food situation remained serious, and many Party members took the lead in reducing their rations. On February 4, 1921, the Party members of the bakery in the Red Presnya District of Moscow made a decision to reduce their rations. In the spring and summer of 1922, a famine occurred in the Volga River basin, and workers and staff in many places voluntarily squeezed out one person's ration from every ten people to help the famine victims, and thirty people shared the care of one starving child.

As soon as the civil war ended, the Communist Party sent cadres to factories to study and pointed out the prospects for construction to the people. In November 1920, three hundred Party members among the responsible workers of the Party and Soviet in Petrograd were sent to factories to participate in manual labor. These people were not given any positions for two months, so that they could go deep into the lower levels and work like workers. In December 1920, at the Eighth All-Russian Congress of Soviets, Lenin put forward the All-Russian Electrification Plan. At that time, industry was in ruins, the level was lower than before the revolution, and electricity was very scarce. In order to make the delegates see the schematic diagram of the All-Russian Electrification Plan, the city, including the Kremlin, had to cut off the electricity supply for several hours. Lenin and the delegates met in the freezing Grand Theater, and their dinner was a small portion of wheat porridge and "tea" made with carrots. But they already had a magnificent blueprint for electrification in their minds. Foreign bourgeois mocked them as foolish old men, and mocked their plan as a utopia. The blind man going downhill laughed at the man going uphill, and laughed too early.

Naturally, it was not easy to restore the national economy, which had suffered seven years of war damage before and after the revolution. At this time, there was an imperialist economic blockade from the outside, and counter-revolutionary elements were causing trouble from the inside. The rich peasants in the countryside were making waves, and the bourgeois elements in the cities were not at ease. The Duglensky Foundry in Kaluga was closed because its equipment was too old, and the workers lost their jobs. The former factory owner encouraged the workers to organize a "cooperative" enterprise led by him, and instigated the workers to mortgage cows and houses to the state bank for funds. The foundry worker Bogutsky, a Party member, came out to persuade the workers to drive away the former factory owner who was stirring up trouble, and went to the management bureau to prove that the factory could still be used. The management bureau appointed him as the director of the factory and allocated 19,000 rubles as funds. He used 9,000 rubles to repair the factory and 10,000 rubles to purchase raw materials. The factory was reborn. He went in and out of the workshop day and night, discussing everything with the workers. The production of this factory continued to increase.

The great construction began. Five-year plans to change the face of the country were carried out one after another. These were all magnificent construction plans. The huge funds for the implementation of these plans had to be raised by themselves. Soviet comrades often said: "At that time, there was only one socialist country in the world. We tightened our belts and restrained ourselves in terms of life enjoyment and many other aspects; otherwise, we would not have been able to establish a strong socialist industry and fundamentally transform agriculture in the shortest period of time, and we would not have been able to preserve the fruits of the October Revolution." In other words, the Soviet Union basically relied on itself, on diligence and thrift to build a strong socialist country. The respectability of the Soviet people, the fearlessness of the Soviet state, and the superiority of the socialist system lie here. On the eve of the start of the first five-year plan, in 1927 and 1928, in order to obtain foreign exchange, Ukraine exported three million rubles of meat and two million rubles of oil. When pork was first exported, the pigs were skinned over a fire, so the bristles were lost. Later, hot water was used to skin the pigs, and the bristles were preserved, which increased the export items. People not only tightened their belts, but also enthusiastically subscribed to public bonds with their first savings. In the first year of the first five-year plan, 411 million rubles were subscribed, and in the fifth year, 3.118 billion rubles were subscribed. The amount increased sevenfold in five years, how enthusiastically people looked forward to the rapid progress of construction!

People spared no effort to participate in production and construction. Women in Donbass went down to the mines to help their husbands mine coal. A large number of young people appeared on construction sites. At that time, machines were scarce, and many factories were built by the hands of workers. The construction workers of the Kharkov Tractor Factory completed the mechanical assembly workshop after a 36-day and night assault. Gandarov, the chief engineer of the construction of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station, said to me: "There is no construction that does not go through difficulties." He participated in the construction of the Volkhov Hydroelectric Power Station. That was the first hydroelectric power station. People had no experience and no technology. At that time, transverse dams were built from both banks to the center of the river, and bridges had to be built across the river, so boats had to be sent to pull large cables to the other side. When the boat was put in the center of the river, the pulley pulling the cable jammed, and the boat was immediately overturned by the rapid current, and some people were sacrificed. However, the hydroelectric power station was finally built. During the construction of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station, a water leakage accident occurred on the dam on the left bank. Water poured into the foundation pit, and sandbags were quickly thrown down and soil was piled up to block the water. An American engineer said to Gandarov: "In addition to funds, you have enthusiasm, which is what we lack. You all have enthusiasm. The lack of technology and experience is supplemented by enthusiasm." Yes, it was relying on this enthusiasm that cannot be found under the capitalist system that large projects such as the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station were built one by one at unprecedented speed, and construction workers also grew up, and they became the backbone of new projects everywhere later.

The countryside, which supplied industry with grain, raw materials, markets, and funds, experienced huge waves in the process of socialist transformation. I have been to the Tamarovsky Collective Farm on the Sea of Azov. Its milk production ranks fifth in Kuban. This collective farm has its own garden and delivery room. This is one of the earliest collective farms in Kuban. In the beginning, a group of hired peasants such as Tamarovsky returned from the army and organized an agricultural commune on the land of the former rich peasants. They were in a state of combat for a long time. When the members went to the field, they carried rifles on their backs and set up machine guns in the field. Once reactionary bandits were discovered, they stopped plowing and fought. At night, people did not live in houses, women and children hid in wheat stacks, and men lay on the grass, holding rifles, to guard against bandits' attacks. In the morning, they went to the field to work again. Common battles and common labor have formed this farm into a rock-like collective. In order to take the road of collectivization, the working peasants and the rich peasants everywhere carried out a life-and-death struggle. In early August 1929, an incident occurred in Tyumen Oblast, Siberia. The "New Road" commune in this oblast was established. League members headed by Yakov actively participated in the establishment and leadership of this commune. They searched out the tractors that the rich peasants had dismantled and buried, assembled them, and handed them over to the commune. One night, while Yakov continued to drive the tractor to work in the field, a group of rich peasants dragged him down, knocked him unconscious, then poured kerosene on him, set him on fire, and fled in a hurry after seeing him die. After Yakov died and revived, he crawled to the road and lost consciousness again. Later, he was rescued by commune members and sent to the hospital. Because of his serious injuries, the hospital prepared for his funeral. The Communist Youth League Pravda mourned this heroic League member. But in the end he was saved, and he is still alive, and the rich peasants who committed the crime were punished. When the peasants voluntarily took the socialist road, no force could stop them.

The invasion of Hitler's army interrupted the peaceful construction of the Soviet Union. The outcome of the Great Patriotic War proved that the Soviet Union, after twenty years of peaceful construction, had laid such a solid foundation that the forces grown on this foundation could eventually defeat the enemy that had ravaged almost all of Europe. Throughout the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union shouldered almost the entire burden of fighting German fascism. The US and British troops only actively moved in Europe after Hitler's army was defeated, in order to grab the fruits of victory. The Soviet Union's victory in World War II not only defended its own country, but also greatly weakened the capitalist world and helped the vast people of Europe and Asia embark on the road of socialism and independence. For this victory, the Soviet people paid a heavy price. Even today, whenever we visit any place in the Soviet Union, we always ask less about family members, because almost no family did not sacrifice relatives in World War II. Many orphans who lost their parents during the war were raised to adulthood by the state. In January 1943, at a mass meeting at the "Red Warrior" factory in Moscow, female worker Ovchinnikova said: "The fathers of the orphans shed blood for us. Mothers, we cannot remain silent, I want to adopt a child to raise. You know, I have four daughters. I will adopt a fifth. We must live on." The Soviets were used to small family life, but the act of adopting war orphans was common during the war. During the war, many women sent their husbands and sons to the front lines, shouldered the burden of production in the rear, and also donated long-term savings to the country. Vasilinova, a female member of the "Seventh Soviet Congress" collective farm in Saratov Oblast, sent her husband to the front line, while taking on her husband's work in the farm and raising her children. In 1943, she donated 100,000 rubles to the country to purchase aircraft. The heroic struggle and arduous struggle of the Soviet people on the front lines and in the rear during this period are endless.

The Great Patriotic War was a test. This test proved how serious difficulties a socialist country like the Soviet Union can overcome and how great a cause it can accomplish. The rapid recovery of the national economy after the war and the development that surpassed the pre-war level was another test. This test proved how powerful a construction force a socialist country like the Soviet Union possesses. The Soviet Union suffered huge losses in manpower and material resources in the war, and tens of thousands of cities and villages were destroyed, but it recovered and grew stronger a few years after the war. In Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, on the Baltic coast and in Moldova, I saw the destroyed cities and villages, factories and schools completely restored. The Donbass coal mine, the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station, the Zaporozhye Iron and Steel Plant, and the Kharkov Tractor Factory were rebuilt from the ruins. Leningrad and Stalingrad, Kiev and Minsk, have been built more beautifully. These were all completed in the first few years after the war with a spirit of struggle under the conditions of very scarce labor force and not very strong financial strength. This requires not only diligence, but also wisdom. A workshop in the Southern Shipyard was tilted sixty centimeters, the roof collapsed, and some pillars were broken. To rebuild it, it had to be completely demolished. According to the suggestion of Chief Engineer Maslov, it was boldly lifted and straightened with thirty-two hydraulic jacks, which weighed 4,500 tons. A railway bridge across the Dnieper River rebuilt in Kiev was completely replaced with electric welding instead of rivets. This greatly shortened the time and saved funds.

In recent years, the Soviet Union has taken a series of important measures to further develop agriculture, industry, and construction. These measures have greatly improved the work and have brought great results. Look, many collective farms have been upgraded from backward to medium, and from medium to advanced; vast wasteland has become new granaries; factories have promoted advanced technology; new industrial bases have risen in the east; the speed of construction has been rapidly increased; the focus of leading production has been shifted downwards; administrative institutions have been streamlined... All this is a process of constantly overcoming difficulties. During the period of agricultural collectivization, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sent 25,000 workers to the countryside to help the peasants; in the past two years, it sent 30,000 people to help backward collective farms. There was a Dimitrov Collective Farm in Leningrad Oblast that was very poorly managed, with each labor day only paying one and a half kopecks. Omilchenko was sent to help. He had been an aircraft mechanic during the war, was injured, and only graduated from university. He found that the farm's problem was that it did not ask about costs, and the milk and meat produced were all losses, because the pigs were fed entirely with potatoes and refined feed, and the cattle were fed with very expensive rutabaga. He vigorously persuaded people to calculate costs, control the expenditure of labor days, and carry out reforms step by step. Under his leadership, the farm concentrated its efforts in the first year to double milk production, and in the second year it managed the greenhouse well. The method of encouraging diligent workers was adopted: members who participated in labor for 300 days a year were paid 11 rubles per labor day; 200 days, 7 rubles; 100 days, 5 rubles. In this way, the backward situation of the farm was reversed.

The Soviet Union is marching towards a communist society with big strides. The Soviet people's spirit of not fearing difficulties and forging ahead inspires us forever, and makes us more confident in building our own motherland without fear of any difficulties. (Attached pictures)

    渡过了千难万苦
    本报记者　李何
    英雄的苏联人民，在列宁主义的共产党领导之下，在地球的六分之一土地上建立了第一个社会主义国家。这是伟大的国家，在这里有史以来劳动者第一次翻了身，成为社会的主人，人人有工做、有饭吃、有书读。这是伟大的国家，它在人类历史短短的四十年间，便拥有高度发达的社会主义的工业、农业和文化，在经济力量方面凌驾许多资本主义国家之上，掌握着原子能发电站、同步稳相加速器、洲际弹道火箭、人造卫星等等惊人的科学技术……。这些事实连资本主义国家的反苏分子也无法否认。这些数不尽的成就，是苏联人民经过数不尽的艰苦斗争取得的。
    苏联同志和我们有过许多次亲切的谈话。每当你赞叹苏联成就的时候，他们总是不无激动地倾吐：“要晓得，苏联人民为社会主义世界打先锋，曾经必须逢山开路，遇水搭桥，单独地打退敌人的包围和进攻。请记住，苏联是在千难万苦中诞生、成长和壮大的。”这些从心腑里掏出来的话语，提醒我们在认识、研究、学习苏联的时候，不要离开这个伟大国家的历史遭遇和艰苦过程。自然，最厚的历史教科书也记载不完苏联人民创造新社会的丰功伟绩。许多事迹散存在人们的记忆和四十年来的报章里，更多的事迹和无名英雄则溶化在今日苏联的事业和成就中了。
    从1917年11月到第二年的一二月，社会主义革命的风暴席卷全俄，苏维埃政权在广阔的土地上“凯歌行进”，无产阶级专政建立起来了。帝国主义者害怕苏维埃政权的存在，立即勾结俄国内部的反革命势力，发动武装干涉和叛乱。初生的苏维埃国家处在危险中。工农群众挺起胸膛来应战。近半数的党员和团员上前线了。人们忍着饥饿，洒着鲜血，保卫住了革命政权。在国内战争和恢复国民经济的过渡时期，人民好几年束紧腰带，进行战斗和工作。当乌克兰、顿河这些产粮区被敌人占领的时候，莫斯科和彼得格勒的工人每两天只领到八分之一磅的面包，有时完全领不到。内战结束后，粮食情况仍然严重，许多党员带头减领口粮。1921年2月4日，莫斯科红色普列斯尼区的面包房的党员们作出了减领口粮的决定。1922年春夏之交，伏尔加河流域发生饥荒，许多地方的工人和职员自愿由十个人挤出一个人的粮食来救济饥民，由三十个人分养一个饥饿的儿童。
    内战一结束，共产党就派干部下厂学习，就向人民指出了建设的远景。1920年11月，彼得格勒党和苏维埃的负责工作人员中有三百个党员被派到工厂参加体力劳动。在两个月中不给这些人任何职务，使他们深入下层，和工人一样工作。1920年12月，在全俄第八次苏维埃代表大会上，列宁提出了全俄电气化计划。当时工业残破，水平比革命前还要低，电力非常缺乏。为了使代表们看明全俄电气化计划的示意图，不得不把全市包括克里姆林宫的用电停送了几个小时。列宁和代表们在冻手冻脚的大剧院开会，晚饭吃的是每人一小份麦粥和用红萝卜煮的“茶”。可是他们的心目中已经有一幅雄伟的电气化蓝图了。外国资产阶级讥笑他们是愚公，讥笑他们的计划是乌托邦。走下坡路的瞎子笑上坡的人，笑得未免太早了。
    自然，革命前后遭受七年战争破坏的国民经济，是不容易恢复的。这时，外有帝国主义的经济封锁，内有反革命分子的捣乱，乡村的富农兴风作浪，城市的资产阶级分子也不安分。卡鲁加城有一个杜格连斯基铸造厂，因为设备太破旧而停闭了，工人们失了业。从前的厂主怂恿工人们由他领头组织“合作社”企业，唆使工人们把母牛和住房向国家银行押借资金。铸工波古次基是党员，他出来说服工人们把挑拨是非的前厂主撵走，又到管理局去证明工厂还可以利用。管理局委他当厂长，拨一万九千卢布作资金。他用九千卢布把工厂作一番大修理，用一万卢布购买原料。工厂再生了。他日日夜夜进出车间，事事和工人们商量。这个工厂的生产不断提高了。
    大建设开始了。改变全国面貌的五年计划一个接着一个进行着。这些都是宏伟的建设计划。实现这些计划的巨额资金都得靠自己筹措。苏联同志常常说：“当时全世界只有一个社会主义国家，我们节衣缩食，在生活享受和其他许多方面克制自己；要不是这样，我们就不能在最短期间建立起强大的社会主义工业和根本地改造了农业，就不能保存十月革命的果实。”换句话说，苏联基本上是靠自己，靠勤俭建成强大的社会主义国家的。苏联人民的可敬，苏联国家的无畏，社会主义制度的优越，就在这里。在第一个五年计划开始前夜，在1927年到1928年，为了取得外汇，乌克兰输出了三百万卢布的肉和二百万卢布的油。开始输出猪肉时，猪是在火上净皮的，所以损失了猪鬃，后来改用开水净皮，把猪鬃保留下来，这样增加了出口项目。人们不仅仅节衣缩食，而且把第一批积蓄踊跃地认购了公债。在第一个五年计划的第一年认购了四亿一千一百万卢布，第五年认购了三十一亿一千八百万卢布。五年增长七倍，人们多么热情地盼望建设的迅速进展呵！
    人们不遗余力地参加生产和建设。顿巴斯的妇女下矿帮助丈夫采煤。大批青年出现在建设工地上。当时机器缺少，许多工厂是靠工人们的双手建筑起来的。哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂的建筑工人，经过三十六昼夜突击，建成了机械装配车间。建筑第聂伯水电站的总工程师甘达洛夫对我说：“没有不经过困难的建设。”他参加过沃尔霍夫水电站的建设。那是第一个水电站。人们没有经验，没有技术。当时从两岸向河心筑起了横坝，必须跨河搭桥，所以要派船把大索拉到对岸。把船放到河心时，拉大索的滑车绞住了，船立刻被急流打翻了，一部分人牺牲了。然而，水电站最后还是筑成了。第聂伯水电站建筑时，左岸的堤坝发生了漏水的事故。水滚滚地灌进基坑，赶紧投下沙包，堆上沙土，才把水堵住了。一位美国工程师对甘达洛夫说过这样的话：“你们除了资金以外还有热情，那是我们所缺少的。你们全体都有热情。技术和经验不足的部分，用热情补充了。”是的，正是依靠这种在资本主义制度下找不到的热情，像第聂伯水电站这些大工程一个个以空前速度建成了，建筑工人也成长了，他们成为后来各地新工程的骨干。
    供给国家工业化以粮食、原料、市场、资金的农村，在社会主义改造的过程中，经历了巨大的风浪。我到过亚速海滨的塔马罗夫斯基集体农庄。它的牛乳产量占库班第五位。这个农庄有自己的花园和接生室。这是库班最早出现的集体农庄之一。当初，塔马罗夫斯基等一批雇农，退伍归来，在从前富农的土地上组织起农业公社，他们许久处在战斗的状态中。社员们下地时候，背上步枪，在田野摆下机关枪，一发现反动匪徒，就停犁作战。夜晚，房子不住人，妇女和儿童躲在麦堆里，男子躺在草地上，托着步枪，防范匪徒的袭击。早晨，又下地耕作。共同的战斗和共同的劳动，把这个农庄结成磐石似的集体。为了走集体化道路，劳动农民和富农到处进行了你死我活的斗争。1929年8月初，在西伯利亚秋门州发生了一桩事。这个州的“新路”公社建立了。以甲科夫为首的团员们积极参加了这个公社的建立和领导。他们把富农拆散和埋藏的拖拉机抄查出来，装配好，交给公社。黑夜，当甲科夫继续驾驶拖拉机在田间工作的时候，一群富农把他拖下来，打昏了，然后在他的身上泼煤油，点火烧，看他死了，匆匆逃走。甲科夫死后复苏，爬到大路上又失去知觉。后来由社员救起送到医院。因为伤势太重，医院替他准备了后事。共青团真理报为这位英勇的团员致了哀悼。但是最后他还是被救活了，现在还活着，而行凶的富农受到了惩罚。当农民自愿走社会主义道路的时候，没有什么力量能够阻挡他们。
    希特勒军队的侵略，打断了苏联的和平建设。卫国战争的结局证明：苏联经过二十年和平建设，已经打下这样雄厚的基础，在这个基础上成长的力量能够最终打败了那横行几乎全欧的敌人。在卫国战争的整个过程中，苏联负起打击德国法西斯的差不多全部重担，美英军队只在希特勒军队被打垮以后才在欧洲积极行动，抢捞胜利果实。苏联在第二次世界大战中的胜利，不仅保卫住了本国，而且大大削弱了资本主义世界，帮助了欧洲和亚洲广大人民走上社会主义和独立的道路。为着这个胜利，苏联人民付出了重大的代价。直到今天，我们到苏联任何地方作客，总是少问家庭成员，因为几乎没有一家在第二次世界大战中没有牺牲亲人。许多在战时失去父母的孤儿由国家抚养成人。1943年1月，在莫斯科“红色勇士”工厂的群众大会上，女工欧福钦尼科娃说：“孤儿的父亲们为我们流了血。母亲们，我们不能不作声，我要抱一个孩子去抚养。你们知道，我有四个女儿。我抱第五个。我们要活下去。”苏联人习惯于小家庭生活，但在战时收养遗孤的义举很普遍。在战时，许多妇女送丈夫和儿子上前线，挑起后方生产的重担，还把长期积蓄捐献国家。萨拉托夫州“第七届苏维埃代表大会”集体农庄女庄员瓦西里诺娃，把丈夫送上了前线，一面担当丈夫在农庄的工作，一面抚养孩子。在1943年捐献了十万卢布给国家添置飞机。苏联人民这个时期在前线和后方所作的英勇斗争和艰苦斗争事迹，是叙述不尽的。
    卫国战争是一次考验。这次考验证明，像苏联这样的社会主义国家能够克服多么严重的困难，能够完成多么巨大的事业。战后国民经济的迅速恢复和超越战前的发展，是又一次考验。这次考验证明，像苏联这样的社会主义国家蕴藏有多么强大的建设力量。苏联在战争中损失了巨大的人力和物力，被毁了成千成万的城市和乡村，但在战后没有几年已经恢复元气，更加壮大。在俄罗斯、乌克兰、白俄罗斯，在波罗的海沿岸和摩尔达维亚，我见到被破坏的城市和乡村、工厂和学校完全恢复了。顿巴斯煤矿、第聂伯水电站、查坡罗什钢铁厂、哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂，从废墟上重建了。列宁格勒和斯大林格勒、基辅和明斯克，建设得更加美丽了。这些都是在战后头几年劳动力非常缺乏、财政力量还不很雄厚的条件下，以战斗的精神完成的。这不但需要勤劳，还需要智慧。南方造船厂有一个车间，整个倾斜了六十公分，顶盖塌了，有些柱子断了。要重建新的，就得把它完全拆毁。根据总工程师马斯洛夫的建议，大胆地用三十二台水压起重机把这全重四千五百吨的车间举起、放正。在基辅重建的一条跨越第聂伯河的铁桥，完全以电焊代替了铆钉。这样大大缩短了时间和节约了资金。
    最近几年苏联在农业、工业、建筑方面采取了一系列进一步发展的重要措施。这些措施把工作狠狠地改进了，已经带来巨大成果。看吧，许多集体农庄由落后升为中等，由中等升为先进；广大的荒地变成新的谷仓；工厂推行先进技术；东部兴起新的工业基地；建筑速度迅速提高；领导生产的重心下移；行政机构精简……。这一切都是不断克服困难的过程。在农业集体化时期，苏联共产党派了二万五千工人下乡帮助农民；前两年又派了三万人员去帮助落后的集体农庄。列宁格勒州有一个季米特洛夫集体农庄，经营得非常不好，每个劳动日只报酬一个半戈比。奥米尔钦科被派去帮助了。他在战时当过航空机械员，受过伤，才从大学毕业。他找出这个农庄的病在于不问成本，所产的牛乳、肉类都是亏本的，因为猪喂的全是马铃薯和精饲料，喂牛用的是很贵的芜菁。他大力说服人们计算成本，控制劳动日的支出，有步骤地进行改革。在他的领导下，这个农庄集中力量在第一年把牛乳产量提高了一倍，第二年搞好了温室。采取了鼓励勤劳者的方法：给一年参加劳动三百天的庄员以每个劳动日十一卢布的报酬；二百天的，七卢布；一百天的，五卢布。这样，把农庄的落后情况扭转过来。
    苏联向共产主义社会大踏步前进。苏联人民不怕困难、勇往直前的精神，永远鼓舞着我们，使我们更加信心百倍地不怕任何困难来建设我们自己的祖国。（附图片）
