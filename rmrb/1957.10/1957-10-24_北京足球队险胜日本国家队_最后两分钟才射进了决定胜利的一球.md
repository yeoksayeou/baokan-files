    Beijing Football Team Narrowly Defeats Japanese National Team
    Winning Goal Scored in the Last Two Minutes
    (Our newspaper's report) On the afternoon of the 23rd, the Japanese football team played its second friendly match in our country against the Beijing football team at the Xiannongtan Stadium. The result was 2-1, with Beijing winning.
    Throughout the match, the Beijing team maintained the offensive for more than 80% of the time, with a total of 38 shots on goal and nine corner kick opportunities. However, it was only in the last two minutes that they managed to score the crucial goal, narrowly defeating the Japanese team 2-1.
            Beijing Team Concedes the First Goal
    Within one minute of the kickoff, the Beijing team launched two quick and fierce attacks. Zhang Honggen and Sun Fucheng both took powerful shots within the penalty area, but the ball went over the goalposts. Under the strong pressure from the home team, the Japanese team adopted a tactic of densely packing their forwards and defenders in the penalty area, defending with all their might. Unexpectedly, the visiting team scored the first goal in less than three minutes. The visiting team's right forward, after receiving a pass from the center forward, quickly passed the ball to left winger Iwabuchi Isao, who dashed in from the left. Iwabuchi Isao quickly dodged past the home team's defender Wang Defa and swept the ball into the goal near the goal line. The goal was scored extremely quickly, causing a stir among the spectators.
          Nian Weisi Scores with a Cold Shot
    After conceding a goal, the Beijing team launched a fierce counterattack. Forwards Sun Fucheng, Zhang Honggen, and Cong Ziyu all took powerful shots, but under the visiting team's dense defensive tactics, the balls were blocked by the visiting team's "human wall." Goalkeeper Furukawa Yoshio also made many saves, blocking shots left and right.
    This 0-1 situation persisted until the last three minutes of the first half when it was broken. At this time, Zhang Honggen received the ball in midfield and passed it to Nian Weisi. Nian Weisi took a step forward and, seeing that the opposing defender did not come up to challenge and the goalkeeper was not paying attention, he immediately took a sudden shot from 30 meters away. The ball curved against the wind, arching straight into the upper left corner of the opponent's goal. Furukawa Yoshio was caught off guard and watched as the ball fell into the net. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw.
          Zhang Honggen Scores the Decisive Goal
    At the start of the second half, the Beijing team pressed hard and attacked fiercely, trying to score a goal quickly. The Japanese team was forced to adopt a dense defensive formation again. At this time, the home team played more anxiously, using the wings less and often kicking the ball into the penalty area, relying on the forwards to rush up and attack fiercely. However, this was not very effective against the visiting team's "screen." On the field, shots on goal were like a barrage of bullets, but the balls mostly hit the Japanese team members and were bounced out. Occasionally, a few balls passed through the crowd but were caught by Furukawa Yoshio.
    With eight or nine minutes left in the match, the Japanese team seemed only interested in drawing, not in winning, and even their forwards retreated to defend. At this time, the Beijing team, including the defenders, crossed the midfield line to launch a fierce attack, and indeed, the visiting team's goal was in constant danger. Sun Fucheng's two sudden turning shots and Cong Ziyu's volley, although all three shots were saved by the visiting team's goalkeeper or headed out by the defenders, made the spectators break out in a cold sweat for the Japanese team.
    It was not until the last two minutes that Ren Bin took a powerful shot in front of the goal. The ball hit an opposing player and bounced out, and Zhang Honggen rushed up to take another shot, and the ball flew into the net from the lower left corner. The Beijing team secured the final victory with this decisive goal.
    After the match, the head of the Japanese football team, Takeshi Shigemaru, told reporters: "The spectators and athletes were very friendly to us in both matches in Beijing." At the same time, he expressed his gratitude to Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and other responsible comrades for watching the first match.

    北京足球队险胜日本国家队
    最后两分钟才射进了决定胜利的一球
    本报讯　23日下午日本足球队在先农坛体育场对北京足球队举行了来我国后的第二场友谊比赛，结果二比一，北京队获胜。
    北京队在全场比赛中占了八成以上的攻势，共射门三十八次，获得了九次发“角球”的机会，只是在最后二分钟内，才射入了这关键性的一球，以二比一险胜了日本队。
            北京队先失一球
    在开球后的一分钟内，北京队即组织了两次快速猛攻，张宏根、孙福成在禁区内先后猛射，但球都越门柱野出。在主队的强力冲压下，日本队采取了锋、卫密集在禁区内，死力防守的战术。但出乎意料之外，在不到三分钟时，客队却先射入了一球。客队右锋在接得中锋的供球后，飞快地一脚传给从左面斜冲而来的左翼岩渊功，岩渊功只一闪便越过主队后卫王德发，在门前端线附近一扫破门。这球踢得快速之极，引起了观众的震动。
          年维泗冷箭建功
    北京队在失却一球后进行了猛烈的反攻，前锋孙福成、张宏根、丛者余都曾举腿猛射，但在客队的密集防守战术下，球都被客队的“人墙”挡出，守门员古川好男左拦右挡也抢救了不少险球。
    这个零比一的局面一直僵持到上半时的最后三分钟才被打破。这时张宏根在中场获球后，一脚传给年维泗，年维泗往前带一步见对方守卫未上来争夺，守门员也未注意，立即出其不意地在三十公尺处举腿猛射，球逆风成一弧形直吊对方门的左上角，古川好男措手不及，眼瞧球落入网内。上半时一比一双方打成平局。
          张宏根一脚定胜负
    下半时一开始，北京队猛压猛攻，力图迅速攻入一球，日本队被逼又采用了密集防守。这时主队踢得较急躁，利用两翼较少，多是得球后一脚吊向禁区，由前锋冲上猛攻，但在客队的“屏风”前收效不大，场上只见射门的球急如连珠炮，但球尽中日本队队员身上而被弹出，偶尔有几球穿过人丛也被古川好男接住。
    还有八、九分钟比赛即将结束了。日本队看来只想求和，不望取胜，连前锋全都撤回防守。北京队这时连后卫都冲过了中线进行猛烈的攻击，果然客队门前险象丛生。孙福成的两次突然转身射门，丛者余的一脚凌空射门，虽然这三球都被客队守门员扑出和被后卫跃起顶出，但观众都替日本队捏一把冷汗。
    直至最后二分钟时，任彬在门前猛力一射，球中对方队员身上弹出，张宏根赶至补上一脚，球才从左下角飞入网内。北京队以这决定胜负的一球，取得了最后胜利。
    比赛结束后，日本足球队领队竹腰重丸对记者说：“在北京的两场比赛，观众和运动员对我们都非常友好”。同时他对周恩来总理、贺龙副总理等负责同志观看了第一场比赛，表示感谢。
