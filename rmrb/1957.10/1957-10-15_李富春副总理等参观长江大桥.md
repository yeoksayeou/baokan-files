Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 14th - Li Fuchun, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, Lu Dingyi and Kang Sheng, alternate members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and others, visited the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which is about to open to traffic, on the 14th.

Li Fuchun, Lu Dingyi, and Kang Sheng, accompanied by Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, and Song Kanfu, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, arrived at the Yangtze River Bridge one after another after 8 a.m. On the highway bridge, they met He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, who had arrived earlier, and Liao Chengzhi, who accompanied her on the visit. Li Fuchun and others had a pleasant conversation with He Xiangning. He Xiangning said that she had crossed the Yangtze River here thirty-one years ago, and at that time she could only take a boat, which was very dangerous when the wind was strong. Li Fuchun said to her that now she could cross the river safely from this bridge. Zhang Pinghua added that this was regardless of wind or rain.

Li Fuchun and others then went down to the railway bridge from the bridgehead on the Hanyang side and visited the hall and statues inside the bridgehead during this process. They walked from the railway bridge all the way to Wuchang on the other side.

Li Fuchun and others also visited the old site of the Yellow Crane Tower—now Bridgehead Park.

The delegation led by Soviet Minister of Transport Construction Kozhevnikov, who was invited to China to participate in the opening ceremony of the Yangtze River Bridge, also visited the bridge, which is about to open to traffic, on the morning of the 14th, accompanied by Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan, Director of the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau Peng Min, and leader of the Soviet expert team, Sirin, and others. The distinguished guests were very interested in this bridge project. On the highway bridge, Kozhevnikov and Teng Daiyuan walked hand in hand, constantly praising the achievements of the project.

　　李富春副总理等参观长江大桥
    新华社武汉14日电　中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李富春，中共中央政治局候补委员陆定一、康生等，14日参观了通车前夕的武汉长江大桥。
    李富春、陆定一、康生在上午八点多钟，分别由中共湖北省委书记张平化、湖北省省长张体学、中共武汉市委第一书记宋侃夫等陪同，先后来到长江大桥。在公路桥上，他们遇见了已先到达的华侨事务委员会主任何香凝和陪同她前来参观的廖承志。李富春等同何香凝进行了愉快的交谈。何香凝说，三十一年前，她曾在这里过过长江，那时只能乘船，风大时很危险。李富春对她说，现在可以平安地从这座桥上过江了。张平化补充说，这是风雨无阻的。
    李富春等接着从汉阳岸的桥头堡下到铁路桥上去，并在这个过程中参观了桥头堡内的大厅和雕像等。他们从铁路桥上一直走到对岸的武昌。
    李富春等还参观了黄鹤楼旧址——现在的桥头公园。
    应邀来我国参加长江大桥落成通车典礼的以苏联运输建设部部长科热夫尼科夫为首的代表团，也在14日上午由铁道部长滕代远和长江大桥工程局长彭敏、苏联专家组组长西林等陪同，参观了这座即将通车的大桥。贵宾们对这个桥梁工程很感兴趣。在公路桥上，科热夫尼科夫同滕代远手挽手地走在一起，不断地称赞工程的成就。（附图片）
