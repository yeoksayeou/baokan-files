Title: Want to "Summon" the "Soul" of the Old Ta Kung Pao?

Rightist elements like Yuan Yuming want to "summon" the "soul" of the old Ta Kung Pao, supposedly because the old Ta Kung Pao had many fine traditions worth inheriting. Therefore, they want to restore the old Ta Kung Pao. Of course, the old Ta Kung Pao was in operation for decades, and through the labor of many people, it did accumulate some useful bits of experience. But the "soul" of the old Ta Kung Pao was extremely reactionary and should be resolutely buried, just like the reactionary Kuomintang regime.

What was the soul of the old Ta Kung Pao? Superficially, it was an "independent, privately-owned newspaper." In its main historical stage, it was actually a newspaper skilled at speculation and disguise, and loyal to the Chiang Kai-shek regime. Some of its staff members were progressive and middle-of-the-road figures, but the position of the newspaper's main leaders at the time was extremely reactionary.

I can cite a few facts I personally experienced.

In 1935, I began working as a traveling reporter for the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao. At that time, I had some goodwill towards the Ta Kung Pao. I once asked Hu Zhengzhi, the then-general manager of the Ta Kung Pao, for some guidance.

I asked him, "What is the most important quality for a journalist to cultivate?"

"Sincerity," he said after thinking for a while. And he continued to expound on the principles of "selflessness."

At the time, I felt that his words made a lot of sense, just like the impression that many kind and naive readers had of the Ta Kung Pao.

In March 1937, I returned to Shanghai from Yan'an and reported to Hu Zhengzhi on the content of the Chinese Communist Party's anti-Japanese national united front and the truth about the Xi'an Incident. I also argued that the Ta Kung Pao should report this most important political situation at the time truthfully. This was originally a difficult matter, because during the Xi'an Incident, the Ta Kung Pao had published many reports slandering the Communist Party, Zhang Xueliang, and Yang Hucheng, and had published some editorials opposing the Xi'an Incident. The Kuomintang had used airplanes to drop the Ta Kung Pao from this period over the Xi'an area. The Northwest region at that time was very resentful of the Ta Kung Pao. Hu Zhengzhi hesitated for a while after my report and suggestion. But after repeatedly confirming that Chiang Kai-shek had indeed been forced to agree to stop the civil war and prepare for resistance against Japan, he decided to reverse the Ta Kung Pao's attitude at the time and published reports on our Party's anti-Japanese national united front.

At the time, I, like many readers, felt that the Ta Kung Pao was ultimately extraordinary.

In October 1937, the Japanese army had already occupied Beiping and Tianjin, and had also occupied Shanghai. The Western imperialist concession areas in Shanghai had become an isolated island surrounded by the Japanese army. Hu Zhengzhi summoned me for another conversation:

"We have become criminals of the nation," he said, looking at me dejectedly.

"Why?" I asked in surprise.

"We advocated resistance against Japan, and 'resisted' the country into this state, and now it looks like the country is about to perish. Aren't we criminals for all eternity?" It was clear that he regretted his speculative decision in the first half of that year.

"The resistance against Japan has only just begun, why be so pessimistic? What's wrong with advocating resistance against Japan?" I was surprised that his attitude had changed so quickly.

"Alright! Consider it yourself," he concluded his conversation.

In the autumn of 1938, Wuhan was preparing to retreat, and the anti-communist backlash was on the rise. At that time, the reactionary rhetoric of "one party, one ideology, one leader" was very rampant. At that time, Zhang Jiluan, the chief editor of the Ta Kung Pao, asked me to learn how to write editorials, so I wrote an article entitled "Party Issues in the War of Resistance," advocating "democratic unity" among all anti-Japanese parties and opposing the idea of "one party." He disagreed with my views. So I published this article in the Anti-Japanese War Third Daily edited by Zou Taofen. Zhang Jiluan was very unhappy and asked me to talk:

"Why did you publish such a view?!" he questioned me sternly.

"I think this view is correct," I replied frankly.

"This view is opposed by Mr. Chiang (i.e., Chiang Kai-shek)," he said.

"I can only agree with the truth."

"The Ta Kung Pao must take Mr. Chiang's attitude as its attitude!" he said excitedly. This was a truth he usually didn't want to say.

"I personally still have my own attitude," I replied bluntly.

"You are a member of the Ta Kung Pao, and you can only take the Ta Kung Pao's attitude as your attitude!" He was annoyed.

"I am Chinese! I want to take the attitude of the Chinese people as my attitude!"

From then on, I left the Ta Kung Pao.

What kind of people would want to "summon" such a "soul"?

### 要“招”旧大公报之“魂”么？

    要“招”旧大公报之“魂”么？
    长江
    袁毓明等右派分子要“招”旧 大公报之“魂”，据说是旧大公报有许多优良传统，值得继承，因此，他们想恢复旧大公报。当然，旧大公报办了几十年，经过许多人的劳动，是有一些可用的点滴经验的。但是作为旧大公报“灵魂”的东西，却是十分反动，应当和国民党反动政权一样，坚决地加以埋葬。
    旧大公报的灵魂是什么？表面上是“独立的民间报纸”，就它的主要历史阶段说，实际上是一张善于投机、善于伪装的忠实于蒋介石政权的报纸。这个报的工作人员中有些进步和中间人士，但那时报纸的最主要的领导人的立场是十分反动的。
    我可以举几个我亲自经历的事实。
    1935年我开始作天津大公报的旅行记者，那时我对大公报是有些好感的。我曾当面要求那时的大公报总经理胡政之给我一些指示。
    我问他：“作新闻记者最主要的修养是什么？”
    “诚”。他想了一会才说。而且继续发挥了一通“大公无私”的道理。
    当时，我觉得他的话很有些道理。正如当时许多善良而天真的读者对大公报的印象一样。
    1937年3月，我从延安回上海，向胡政之报告了中国共产党抗日民族统一战线的内容和西安事变的真象，并且主张大公报应据实发表这个当时最重要的政治情况。这本来是一件难事，因为在西安事变期间，大公报曾发表许多诬蔑共产党、张学良和杨虎城的报道，并发表了一些反对西安事变的社论，国民党曾用飞机向西安一带投掷这个时期的大公报，西北一带那时对大公报十分反感。胡政之对我的报告和建议犹豫了一阵。但他再三问明了蒋介石是否真的被迫答应了停止内战、准备抗日之后，他决定一反大公报当时的态度，发表了关于我们党的抗日民族统一战线的报道。
    我当时和许多读者一样，觉得大公报到底不平常。
    1937年10月，日军已占领了北平、天津，并且已占领了上海。上海的西方帝国主义的租界区，已成日军包围的一座孤岛。胡政之又约我谈了一次话：
    “我们已成民族的罪人了。”他颓然地望了望我。
    “为什么？”我奇怪地问。
    “我们主张抗日，把国家‘抗’成这个样子，眼看就要亡国。我们不是千秋万世的罪人么？”很显然，他悔恨他在那年上半年投机性的决定了。
    “抗日刚才开始，怎么就悲观起来了呢？主张抗日，又有什么错呢？”我奇怪他的态度变得这样快。
    “好吧！你自己考虑。”他结束了他的谈话。
    1938年秋，武汉已经准备撤退了，反共的逆流正在抬头，那时“一个党、一个主义、一个领袖”的反动言论十分嚣张。那时大公报总主笔张季鸾要我学写社评，我就写了一篇“抗战中的党派问题”，主张各抗日党派“民主团结”，反对“一个党”的主张。他不同意我的看法。我就把这篇文章在邹韬奋主编的抗战三日刊上发表了。张季鸾很不高兴，约我谈话：
    “你为什么发表这样的主张？！”他严厉地质问我。
    “我认为这种主张正确。”我坦然回答。
    “这种主张是蒋先生（即蒋介石）所反对的。”他说。
    “我只能赞成真理。”
    “大公报必须以蒋先生的态度为态度！”他激动起来。这是他平日不肯讲的一句实在话。
    “我个人还有我自己的态度。”我直截了当地回答。
    “你是大公报的人，只能以大公报的态度为态度！”他恼怒了。
    “我是中国人！我要以中国人民的态度为态度！”
    从此，我就离开了大公报。
    这样的“魂”，什么人才要去“招”呢？
