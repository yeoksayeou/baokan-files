    Following Ilyich
    By our correspondent Cheng Guangrui
    People are familiar with the village of Gorki outside Moscow, because the great Vladimir Ilyich Lenin spent his last years and the last moments of his life here. The famous Vladimir Ilyich Collective Farm in the Moscow region is located here. We visited this farm on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.
    The Kashira highway going south from Moscow divides the village of Gorki into two halves. The villa where Lenin rested in his later years is in a dense forest on the east side of the road, and the farm's office is on the west side. We met the chairman of the farm and the Party Committee secretary at the farm office. The farm chairman, Ivan Andreyevich Buyanov, is sixty years old this year. He is a native of this village and was elected as the chairman of the farm when it was established. The Party Committee secretary, David Markovich Basionok, is in his fifties. After the revolution, he worked for the Party in the nearby county before coming to this farm.
    "What changes has the village of Gorki undergone in the past forty years?" "What path have the farmers of Gorki taken?" The hosts enthusiastically answered our questions.
    Before the revolution, the village of Gorki was a poor village with only thirty-six small houses. Although there were no landlords in the village at that time, many farmers cultivated land belonging to the nearby landlord Gerasimov. Farmers had little land and could not support their families by farming, so many left their hometowns to seek a living in nearby cities. Farm chairman Buyanov went to Moscow to become an apprentice at the age of twelve.
    The dawn of the October Revolution shone on the village of Gorki, and the poor peasants turned over and gained land. However, as Lenin said, it is impossible to get rid of poverty by relying on a small-scale peasant economy. After the revolution, the lives of the farmers in Gorki, who cultivated on scattered small plots of land, were still very hard. "Just look at the situation of Gubantsova at that time to understand," said Party Committee secretary Basionok. "Gubantsova married into the village of Gorki from another place in 1919. When someone asked her how her life was at that time, she said that all she remembered was crying all day long, crying about her poor fate, how she married into such a poor village."
    In those years, the farmers of the village of Gorki had a good neighbor, namely Lenin. When Lenin lived in the village of Gorki, he had many cordial meetings and conversations with the farmers in the village. On January 9, 1921, at the home of farmer Vasily Shulgin, Lenin advised the farmers to unite and cultivate the land together. At another gathering of farmers in the village of Gorki that year, Lenin more clearly told those farmers who had not yet organized that only collective labor could liberate and save the peasants from bondage.
    In 1927, the Fifteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed a resolution to vigorously develop agricultural collectivization. The Party's resolution was widely publicized throughout the Soviet Union. At that time, Basionok also came to the village of Gorki to convene a farmers' meeting to promote the benefits of collectivization. After one or two years of preparation, in September 1929, which was the "year of the great turning point," the village of Gorki finally established a collective farm. When the farm was first established, only twenty-nine peasant households participated, twenty of whom had no horses. At that time, they only had eighteen horses, three cows, two single-bladed plows, one iron-wheeled cart, one mower, and one horse-drawn seeder. At the founding meeting of the farm, the members unanimously elected Buyanov as the chairman of the farm. Buyanov still remembers how warmly member Nikolai Benjielin said to him at the time: "Lenin and the Soviet regime will always give us farmers land. We trust you, Buyanov. Just make sure you are walking on the right path, don't go astray! You must know that Ilyich wants to see us farmers become rich and powerful."
    "Naturally, things would not be so simple, and there were still many difficulties after the establishment of the farm," Basionok said. "At that time, throughout the country, rich peasants posed a great threat to collective farms, and in the village of Gorki, farm chairman Buyanov was also threatened.
    As soon as the farm was established, difficulties arose. Money was needed to buy seeds, but where could they get money? The result was a decision to transport goods to factories in the city. All winter, the members drove horse-drawn carts, through wind and snow, earning 65,000 rubles. So they used part of the money to buy seeds, and the remaining money was kept to buy wood.
    The farm's first year's harvest was very good, and the members were really happy. They handed over the first batch of newly harvested grain to the state. They wrote their inner thoughts on the slogans on the grain transport vehicles: "The Soviet regime gave us land and will, it is our life."
    When the work-day income was distributed in the autumn, each member received a lot of grain, potatoes, vegetables, and milk, but no money was distributed. This was not because the farm had no money; the farm sold 10,000 poods of potatoes and had a lot of money. However, the farm needed construction, and the members agreed not to distribute money, but to save the money to develop the farm. In the first year, they accumulated 45,000 rubles and built cowsheds and warehouses.
    Farm chairman Buyanov also remembers a very interesting thing that happened at that time. At that time, Alexandra Ivanova was a member of the farm, and her father, Mikhail Ivanovich, was a single farmer. Alexandra pulled a cart of grain home, which was her work-day income for five months of joining the farm, which was more than her father's income for a whole year of working alone. Ivanovich didn't believe it at first, but that was the fact. At night, Ivanovich couldn't sleep, and finally decided to go to the farm chairman. Buyanov was puzzled by Ivanovich's sudden arrival, so he asked: "What's wrong, Ivanovich? Are you here to ask me to return your daughter to you?" Ivanovich lowered his head in shame and said: "No, no! I want to ask you for help, do you think I can become a member?"
    The farm convinced the individual farmers with facts. Not long after the first harvest, all the individual farmers in the village of Gorki, like Ivanovich, applied to join the farm. Buyanov said: "From that time on, the farm's first tractor plowed open the boundary line between the farmland of the farm members and the individual farmers, the farmland of the farmers in the village of Gorki became one, and the farm also developed."
    The harvests were very good in the years before the war, especially the development of the vegetable industry brought good income to the farm. The farm used the money from growing vegetables to build water towers and add farm tools. The members' work-day income also increased.
    The war destroyed the peaceful life of the Soviet people. In the village of Gorki, as in other parts of the Soviet Union, the female members sent their husbands and sons to the front, and they shouldered the heavy burden of increasing production and supporting the front. The hard work of the members enabled the farm to still have good harvests during the war years. For example, the average yield of wheat per hectare in various places at that time was 22 quintals, while the average yield of wheat per hectare on this farm was 25 quintals. Such a harvest had never been seen in this farm in the past.
    After the war, the Ilyich Farm developed year by year. In 1951, this farm merged with three farms in nearby villages, and the development of the new Ilyich Farm received more favorable conditions. Especially since 1953, the Party and the government have taken a series of measures to further develop agriculture and animal husbandry, which has enabled this farm to develop more rapidly.
    Farm chairman Buyanov compared the situation when the farm was first established with the present, and said: "In the past, our farm only had twenty-one head of livestock, now there are three hundred; in the past, there was only one tractor, now there are eleven; in the past, there were no vegetables and orchards, now various vegetables and fruits have been planted. Now our farm is a farm with multiple economies." The farm's milk production ranks first in the Moscow region.
    As the farm develops, there is also more construction on the farm. In recent years, the farm has built two cowsheds, four chicken coops, seven vegetable storage houses, and water pipes connecting the four residential villages of the farm, as well as irrigation canals for vegetable fields and orchards. Currently under construction are mechanized pigsties, new chicken coops, fish ponds, a cultural palace, and twenty-five new dormitories with running water and heating equipment. In addition, a 1.5-kilometer-long farm road is also under construction.
    As the farm develops, the lives of the members have also improved. Last year, each work-day exceeded twenty-five rubles. In the past three years, nearly one hundred members have moved into spacious new homes. Now, every family on the farm has good furniture and clothing; every family has a radio, and more than 60% of families also have televisions; every family subscribes to newspapers and magazines. The same is true of the family of Gubantsova, who used to cry about her poor fate thirty or forty years ago. Now she works on the farm with her daughter, and last year they did a total of 1,000 work-days, earning more than 20,000 rubles, not including the income from her family's homestead. They now live in a three-room house, but Gubantsova told us that she is also planning to rebuild a new house that is three times the size of the old house, further away from the highway, and add a small garden, so that life can be more "cultural".
    The members of the Ilyich Farm have created a happy life through hard collective labor, and have also earned honors. Currently, fifty members of the farm have received various medals and awards, including seven who have been awarded the Order of Lenin. Farm chairman Buyanov is a two-time Hero of Socialist Labor and recipient of the Order of Lenin.
    After saying goodbye to the farm, we visited the villa where Lenin rested in the village of Gorki in his later years. Looking west from the window of the villa, the rows of houses and neat ridges of the Ilyich Farm are clearly visible. At this time, I remembered the words of Shulgin, a member of the Ilyich Farm, who said: "Our great leader saw the great future of us farmers, and we are realizing his legacy on our own land. If Ilyich were still alive, how happy he would be to see the changes in this once poor village!" (Attached picture)

    跟着伊里奇走
    本报记者　程光锐
    提起了莫斯科郊外的哥尔克村，人们都很熟悉，因为伟大的弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁曾在这里度过他的晚年和生命的最后一刻。莫斯科州著名的弗拉基米尔·伊里奇集体农庄就在这里。我们在十月革命四十周年前夕访问了这个农庄。
    从莫斯科南去的卡什拉公路把哥尔克村分成两半。列宁当年休养的别墅在路东一片茂密的森林里，农庄的办公处在路西。我们在农庄办公处会见了农庄的主席和党委书记。农庄主席伊万·安德列也维奇·布亚诺夫今年六十岁了，他是本村人，在农庄成立时就被选为农庄的主席。党委书记大卫·马尔科维奇·巴西奥诺克今年五十多岁，革命后就在附近县里做党的工作，后来才到这个农庄来的。
    “四十年来哥尔克村经过了什么样的变化？”“哥尔克村的农民走过了什么样的道路？”——主人们热情地回答了我们这些问题。
    革命前，哥尔克村是一个穷困的小村庄，总共才有三十六座小房子。当时这个村庄里虽然没有地主，可是许多农民种的地都是附近的地主格拉西莫夫的。农民地少，靠地养不活家小，很多人背井离乡到附近城里去谋生。农庄主席布亚诺夫十二岁就到莫斯科去当学徒了。
    十月革命的曙光照到了哥尔克村，贫苦的农民翻了身，有了土地。可是，正像列宁所说的，靠小农经济是摆脱不了贫困境遇的。革命后，在分散的小块土地上耕种的哥尔克村农民们，生活仍然很苦。“只要看看当时古班曹娃的情况就明白了。”党委书记巴西奥诺克说：“古班曹娃是1919年从外地嫁到哥尔克村来的。有人问她当时的生活怎样？她说她只记得那时候一天到晚就是哭，哭自己的命穷，怎么嫁到这样个穷村子来的。”
    那些年，哥尔克村的农民有个好邻居，就是列宁。列宁住在哥尔克村的时候，和村里的农民曾有过许多次亲切的会见和谈话。1921年1月9日在农民华西里·舒里庚家里，列宁曾劝告农民们联合起来共同耕种田地。在那一年哥尔克村农民的另一次集会上，列宁更明确地对那些还没有组织起来的农民说，只有集体劳动才能把农民从束缚中解放和拯救出来。
    1927年，苏联共产党第十五次代表大会通过了尽量开展农业集体化的决议。党的决议在苏联全国各地进行广泛的宣传。当时巴西奥诺克也曾到哥尔克村来召开过农民大会，宣传集体化的好处。经过了一两年的酝酿之后，1929年，也就是“大转变的一年”，9月里，哥尔克村终于成立了集体农庄。农庄刚成立的时候，只有二十九户农民参加，其中二十户没有马。那时候他们只有十八匹马、三头牛、两个单铧犁、一个铁轮车、一个割草机和一个马拉播种机。在农庄的成立大会上，庄员们一致推选布亚诺夫担任农庄主席。布亚诺夫至今还记得，当时庄员尼古拉·本杰林曾经如何热情地对他说：“列宁、苏维埃政权永远给咱们庄稼汉土地。我们信任你，布亚诺夫。只是要看到你顺着正确的道路走，可不要下了道儿！要知道伊里奇想看到咱们庄稼汉富起来，有力量。”
    “自然事情不会这样简单，农庄成立后还有许多困难。”巴西奥诺克说：“当时，在全国范围内，富农对集体农庄的威胁很大，在哥尔克村，农庄主席布亚诺夫也受到了威胁。
    农庄刚成立，困难就来了，需要钱买种子，可是哪里有钱呢？结果是决定给城市里的工厂去运货。一冬天庄员们赶着马车，风里去，雪里来，挣了六万五千卢布。于是他们就用一部分钱买了种子，余下的钱留着买木料。
    农庄第一年的收成很好，庄员们真高兴。他们把第一批新收获的粮食交给了国家。他们把自己心里的话写在送粮车上的标语上：“苏维埃政权给了我们土地和意志，它就是我们的生命。”
    秋天分配劳动日收入的时候，每个庄员都得到了不少的粮食、土豆、蔬菜和牛奶，但是却没有分到钱。这倒不是农庄没有钱，农庄卖了一万普特土豆，有不少的钱。不过农庄需要建设，庄员们同意不分钱，把钱省下来发展农庄。头一年他们积了四万五千卢布，就盖了牛舍和仓库。
    农庄主席布亚诺夫还记得当时发生的一件很有意思的事。那时候亚历山得拉·伊万诺娃是农庄庄员，她的父亲米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇是单干户。亚历山得拉把一车粮食拉回家，那是她加入农庄五个月的劳动日收入，比她爸爸单干整整一年的收入还要多。伊万诺维奇起初不相信，但是事实就是那样。晚上，伊万诺维奇怎么也睡不下，最后决定去找农庄主席。伊万诺维奇的突然来临使布亚诺夫摸不着头脑，他就问：“怎么，伊万诺维奇？你是不是来要我把你的女儿还给你？”伊万诺维奇这时惭愧地低着头说：“不，不！我想请求你帮助，你看我能不能成为一个庄员？”
    农庄用事实说服了单干户。在第一次收获后不久，哥尔克村的单干户，都像伊万诺维奇一样，全部申请加入了农庄。布亚诺夫说：“从那时候起，农庄的第一架拖拉机犁开了农庄庄员和单干户田地之间的分界线，哥尔克村农民的田地连成了一片，农庄也发展起来了。”
    战前那些年收成都很好，尤其是蔬菜业的发展给农庄带来了很好的收入。农庄用种蔬菜收入的钱建了水塔，添了农具。庄员的劳动日收入也增加了。
    战争破坏了苏联人民的和平生活。在哥尔克村，也和在苏联各地一样，女庄员们把自己的丈夫、儿子送上前线，自己在后方肩负起增加生产、支援前线的沉重的担子。庄员们的辛勤劳动，使这个农庄在战争年代里仍然收成很好。例如当时各地小麦的中等收成每公顷是二十二公担，而这个农庄的小麦每公顷平均收了二十五公担。这样的收成过去在这个农庄里还从未有过。
    战后，伊里奇农庄逐年发展着。1951年，这个农庄和附近村子的三个农庄合并起来，新的伊里奇农庄的发展得到了更有利的条件。特别是1953年以来，党和政府采取了一系列的进一步发展农业和畜牧业的措施，使这个农庄更迅速地发展起来。
    农庄主席布亚诺夫把这个农庄刚成立时的情况和现在作了一个对比，他说：“从前我们的农庄只有二十一头牲口，现在已经有三百头；从前只有一架拖拉机，现在已有十一架；从前没有蔬菜和果园，现在已经种了各种蔬菜和水果。现在我们的农庄已是多种经济的农庄了。”这个农庄的牛奶产量在莫斯科州占第一位。
    农庄发展了，农庄的建设也多了。最近几年这个农庄建筑了两个牛舍、四个鸡舍、七个蔬菜房，还有通达四个农庄居民村的自来水管和灌溉菜田和果园的水渠。现在正在建筑的有机械化的猪舍、新的鸡舍、养鱼池、文化宫和二十五座有自来水与暖气设备的新宿舍，此外还正在建一条一公里半长的农庄公路。
    农庄发展了，庄员的生活也提高了。去年每个劳动日已超过了二十五个卢布。最近三年里，将近一百户庄员搬进了宽敞的新住宅。现在，农庄的每个家庭中都有很好的家具和衣裳；每个家庭都有收音机，60％以上的家庭还有电视机；每个家庭都订有报纸和杂志。那个在三四十年前常哭自己命穷的古班曹娃的家庭也是这样。现在她和自己的女儿一起在农庄工作，去年共做了一千个劳动日，收入两万多卢布，这还不包括她家宅边园地上的收入。她们现在住着一座有三个房间的房子，可是古班曹娃对我们说：她还准备重盖一座有旧房三倍大的新房子，要离公路远些，再布置个小花园，以便使生活过得更“文化”一些。
    伊里奇农庄庄员们用辛勤的集体劳动创造了幸福的生活，也换来了荣誉。目前这个农庄有五十个庄员获得了各种勋章和奖章，其中有七个人荣获了列宁勋章。农庄主席布亚诺夫就是两次社会主义劳动英雄和列宁勋章获得者。
    告别了农庄，我们又参观了列宁当年在哥尔克村休养的别墅。从别墅的窗口向西望去，伊里奇农庄一排排的房舍和整齐的田垅历历在目。这时候我想起了伊里奇农庄庄员舒里庚的话，他说：“我们伟大的领袖看到了我们农民的远大前程，我们在自己的乡土上实现着他的遗训。假如伊里奇还活着的话，他看到这个过去的穷困村庄的变化，是多么高兴啊！”（附图片）
