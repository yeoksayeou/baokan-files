　　Seeing the Essence of Bourgeois Newspapers from "The New York Times"
　　Zhang Zhenya
    Negating the Party's leadership over newspapers, denying that newspapers are tools of class struggle, and demanding "colleague-run" newspapers are the program of the right-wing elements' attack on the Party in the field of journalism. This kind of argument has its historical origin. As early as 1896, Ochs, the former publisher of "The New York Times," chanted that his newspaper's policy was to "publish the news impartially, without fear or favor of anyone, and without regard to any party, faction, or interest." However, later facts proved that this was nothing more than a huge lie fabricated by the bourgeoisie. This newspaper, which developed with the help of the Morgan Consortium, has in fact always served the American big bourgeoisie through and through.

    Like many large bourgeois newspapers, "The New York Times" outwardly pretends to be very democratic and objective. From the reports of this newspaper, you can see the American people's protests against the government's tax policies, the infighting between various factions within the government and Congress, President Eisenhower's weakness and incompetence, racial discrimination, economic turmoil... In order to flaunt its "objectivity," "The New York Times" also specially prints "All the News That's Fit to Print" next to its masthead. But the problem lies in the word "fit." Since there is "fit" or "unfit," there is also a standard of selection. For "The New York Times," this standard is the unadulterated interests of the bourgeoisie.

    As long as you carefully read "The New York Times" every day, you will find that under the guise of objectivity, it contains poison and deception everywhere. Not only does it defend and praise the American capitalist system (the so-called free enterprise system) everywhere between the lines, but it also tries its best to blur the American people's understanding of the various social, political, and economic problems that plague them. Under the smoke screen of so-called "objective" reporting of all events, its dozens of pages, in addition to publishing a large number of advertisements, are actually filled with various trivial, boring news that makes readers feel as if they are lost in a fog. News of congressional meetings takes up a lot of space in "The New York Times" every year, but from these reports, you can only see some congressmen engaging in endless, sometimes even ridiculous, debates and haggling over some insignificant details of various bills. You can't understand the essence of these struggles and their deception at all, let alone understand the essence of the entire American political system.

    No matter how objective this newspaper pretends to be, once it touches the actual interests of large enterprises, the reactionary bourgeois stance of this newspaper will inevitably be exposed nakedly. Here, I will only cite some of the recent remarks made by "The New York Times" on the issue of rising prices in the United States as an example. From this, readers can easily understand what the "no fear or favor of anyone" newspaper policy boasted by Ochs contains.

    Rising prices in the United States are a major issue that is causing anxiety in all sectors. The federal government's huge budget has therefore been criticized by all parties. Public opinion also demands that the government directly come forward to stop monopoly capital from arbitrarily raising prices. However, "The New York Times" not only did not support these demands, but also tried its best to cover up the extent of the price increase and defend Eisenhower's budget. On June 7, "The New York Times" also published a commentary by its reporter Arthur Krock, entitled "American Labor Spokesmen's 'Ostrich' Attitude Toward Inflation," blaming inflation on the working class. He alarmingly warned that if the trade unions did not change their attitude on wage issues, the United States would fall into a disaster of inflation even more dangerous than that of Britain and France. In this way, this reporter shifted the responsibility for the US inflation from the shoulders of big business and the government to the labor.

    "The New York Times"'s position of exonerating big business and stubbornly opposing labor became even more naked after the major American monopoly capitalists continued to raise prices in early July, which was criticized by public opinion.

    This debate was triggered after Senator Kefauver, chairman of the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee, pointed out in early July that American big businesses used "administered prices" (i.e., monopoly prices – author's note) to monopolize the market, resulting in a "new inflation" that made the government's tight monetary policy ineffective. At the time, Kefauver said: The reason why prices in the United States are rising now "is only because certain concentrated industries still have the power to raise prices even during periods of declining demand, and they do not hesitate to use this power." Kefauver's opinion was obviously in line with the actual situation. American Steel Corporation and major oil companies, which have a significant impact on prices in the United States, also raised prices once in early June amid shrinking market demand. Kefauver's exposure aroused great dissatisfaction from "The New York Times." On July 9, "The New York Times" questioned whether Kefauver was speaking fairly with the four words "administered prices" in parentheses as the title; and argued strongly that if it is insisted that the capitalists have "administered prices," then the labor also has "administered wages," and the labor side should also be responsible for the price increase.

    Not only that, in an editorial entitled "Senate Studies Prices" published in the newspaper on July 17, it also deliberately distorted the speech of Yale University economics professor Richard Ruggles at a Senate committee; insisting that Ruggles also believed that the cause of inflation was due to the increase in wages. As a result, the professor had to write a letter to "The New York Times" on July 20, requesting a correction of this distortion, and solemnly pointed out that "making wage increases the culprit (leading to inflation) will not solve the problem."

    "The New York Times," which claims to be an objective recorder of all events and a free forum for expressing various opinions, has such a true face. And this is just one example picked up at random. The right-wing elements want our newspapers to take the direction of "The New York Times," isn't their intention very clear?

　　从“纽约时报”看资产阶级报纸的实质
　　张振亚
    否定党对报纸的领导，否认报纸是阶级斗争的工具，要求办“同人”报，是右派分子在新闻事业方面向党进攻的纲领。这种主张，有其历史的渊源。早在1896年，“纽约时报”的前发行人奥克斯就高唱他的报纸的方针是“公正地发布新闻，不害怕和偏袒任何人，对任何政党、派系和有关方面都无所忌惮。”可是后来的事实证明这不过是资产阶级所编造的一个弥天大谎。这家依靠摩根财团的资助发展起来的报纸，实际上一直彻头彻尾地为美国大资产阶级服务。
    正像许多资产阶级的大报一样，“纽约时报”在外表上是装得好像很民主、很客观。从这家报纸的报道中，你可以看到美国人民对政府赋税政策的抗议、政府和国会内各派之间的倾轧、艾森豪威尔总统的软弱无能、种族歧视、经济的动荡不安……。为了标榜它的“客观”，“纽约时报”还特地在它的报头旁边印上“一切适于发表的东西”。但是问题就在这个“适于”二字上。既然有“适合”或“不适合”，也就有一个选择的标准。对于“纽约时报”说来，这个标准就是不折不扣的资产阶级利益。
    只要细心翻读每天的“纽约时报”，你就会发现在伪装客观的外衣下面，处处包藏着毒素和欺骗。它们不仅字里行间到处在为美国的资本主义制度（所谓自由企业制度）辩护和歌颂，而且也千方百计地在模糊美国人民对各种苦恼着他们的社会、政治和经济问题的认识。在所谓“客观”报道一切事件的烟幕下，它的几十个版除过刊登大量广告以外实际上填满了各种繁琐、无聊、使读者如坠入五里雾中的新闻。国会会议新闻每年要占去“纽约时报”大量篇幅，但是从这些报道中，你除了看到一些议员就各项议案中一些无关宏旨的琐细事项进行无休止、有时甚至是可笑的争论和讨价还价以外，根本不了解这些斗争的实质和它们的欺骗性，更不要说去洞悉美国整个政治制度的本质了。
    不论这家报纸装得如何客观，在一旦触及大企业的实际利益时，这家报纸的反动的资产阶级立场总不免赤裸裸地暴露出来。这里只举“纽约时报”最近以来就美国物价上涨问题所发表的一些言论为例。从这里读者不难了解，奥克斯所吹嘘的“不害怕和偏袒任何人”的办报方针究竟包含怎样的内容。
    美国物价的上涨是引起各界不安的一个主要问题。联邦政府的庞大预算因此曾遭到各方的抨击。舆论还要求政府直接出面制止垄断资本任意抬高物价。但是“纽约时报”非但不支持这些要求，反而千方百计掩饰物价上涨的程度，为艾森豪威尔的预算辩护。6月7日“纽约时报”还发表了它的记者阿瑟·克罗克的一篇评论，题为“美国工会发言人对待通货膨胀的‘驼鸟’姿态”，把通货膨胀归咎于工人阶级。他耸人听闻地警告说，倘若工会在工资问题上不改变态度，美国就会陷入甚至比英、法还要险恶的通货膨胀的灾难中去。这位记者就用这种方法把导致美国通货膨胀的责任从大企业和政府的肩上一古脑儿推到了劳工的身上。
    “纽约时报”为大企业开脱责任、顽固地反对劳工的立场，在7月初美国大垄断资本继续抬高物价遭到舆论的指摘以后，就更加赤裸裸地暴露出来。
    这次争论是在7月初参议院反托辣斯和垄断小组委员会主席克弗维尔指摘美国大企业用“支配价格”（即垄断价格——作者注）垄断市场，以致造成一种使政府的紧缩银根政策无法奏效的“新的通货膨胀”以后引起的。当时克弗维尔曾说：目前美国物价的所以上涨“只是由于某些集中的工业，甚至在需求下降时期仍然有力量抬高物价，并且它们在运用这种力量时毫不踌躇。”克弗维尔的这个意见显然是符合实际情况的。对美国物价有重大影响的美国钢铁公司和大石油企业在6月初市场需求萎缩声中还抬高了一次价格。克弗维尔的揭发引起了“纽约时报”的很大不满。7月9日“纽约时报”以带有括弧的“支配价格”这四个字作标题，质问克弗维尔是否在讲公平话；并强辞夺理地争辩说，如果硬说资方有“支配价格”那么劳方也有“支配工资”，劳工方面也要对物价上涨负责。
    不仅如此，在该报7月17日的一篇题为“参议院在研究物价”的社论中还有意歪曲耶鲁大学经济教授理查兹·罗格尔斯在参议院一个委员会上的发言；硬说罗格尔斯也认为通货膨胀的原因是由于工资的上涨。结果使这个教授不得不在7月20日写信给“纽约时报”，要求更正这种歪曲，并郑重指出，“把工资上涨作为（导致通货膨胀的）罪人是不能解决问题的。”
    自称是一切事件的客观记录者、是一个可以发挥各种意见的自由讲坛的“纽约时报”，其真实面目就是这样。而这还不过是随手拈来的一个例子。右派分子要我们报纸走的就是“纽约时报”这种方向，其意图如何，不是很明白的吗？
