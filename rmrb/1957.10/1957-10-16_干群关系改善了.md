The cadre-masses relationship has improved.

Li Delu, assistant director of the Thermal Repair Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, used to have a rigid and subjective work style. After the start of the Rectification Movement, workers put up many big-character posters criticizing him. He made self-criticisms on each point and solved sixteen problems raised by the masses within ten days. His work style also underwent a great change, which won the understanding and praise of the masses. The workers put up a big-character poster saying "Our Thermal Repair Director has changed his ways" to commend him. (Attached picture)
