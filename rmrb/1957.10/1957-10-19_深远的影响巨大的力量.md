　　The excellent Soviet literature has left a profound impact on the youth of our country. In Shanghai, there is a 24-year-old young man named Ruan Songming. Rheumatic arthritis has kept him bedridden for years, and he had already despaired of his future. However, the book "How the Steel Was Tempered" brought him courage and hope. He was determined to become a translator and introduce some of the excellent Soviet works to China. In June 1952, he began attending the Russian language broadcast school. In two years, he achieved excellent results and received a banner as a "model student." Later, with the help of the Soviet teacher Maria Shuvalova, he continued to study, and by 1956, he had reached the level of a graduate of a Russian language specialized school.

　　Now, he has successively published more than fifty translations in newspapers and magazines. He has also completed the translation of a novella, "The Test" (by A. Pchenok). He is currently working on translating a collection of short stories by the Hungarian writer "Zsoltkei Short Stories," which contains more than 200,000 words.

　　In 1956, he joined the Communist Youth League and is now a member of the Youth League branch committee. (Attached photo)

　　深远的影响巨大的力量
    苏联优秀的文艺书籍在我国青年中留下了深远的影响。在上海，有一个二十四岁的青年人阮颂铭，风湿性关节炎使他长年躺在床上不能动弹，对自己的前途原已绝望。但“钢铁是怎样炼成的”这本书给他带来了勇气和希望。他下定决心要成为一个翻译工作者，把苏联的一些优秀作品介绍到中国来。1952年6月，他开始参加了俄语广播学校，在两年里，他的成绩优异，得到了“学习模范”的锦旗。以后在苏联教师玛利亚·舒瓦洛娃的帮助下继续学习，到1956年已达到俄文专科学校毕业生的水平。
    现在，他已经在报刊上陆续发表了五十多篇译文。还译完了一本中篇小说“考验”（阿·普切诺克著）。目前正在着手译一本二十多万字的匈牙利作家“乔尔凯呢短篇小说集”。
