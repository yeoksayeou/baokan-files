    Three Minutes to Make a Window, Ten Minutes to Make a Door
    The “Combined Door and Window Machine” created by Liu Zhicheng, a carpenter from the First Construction Company of Qinghai Province, has begun production.
    This combined machine can continuously perform nine processes, including planing, grooving, drilling, polishing, and lock opening, and can directly produce finished doors and windows. Generally, it is twenty-eight times more efficient than the equivalent number of sixth-grade workers making wooden windows and eleven times more efficient at making doors; it can produce a window every three minutes and make a door in just ten minutes.

    三分钟做一面窗  十分钟做一扇门
    青海省第一建筑公司木工刘志诚创制的“联合门窗机”开始生产。
    这种联合机可以连续进行刨料、拔槽、打眼、磨光、开锁等九种工序，能够直接生产出门窗成品。一般比同等数量的六级工做木窗的效率高二十八倍，做门的效率高十一倍；每三分钟可以生产一个窗，制作一个门也只要十分钟。
