　　Righteousness Ascends After Great Debate

　　After a great socialist debate, members of the Dayu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Weibin Township, Dongliao County, Jilin Province, universally received a profound socialist education, strengthened their positions, distinguished right from wrong, and their production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. Those who originally didn't listen to work assignments now follow them, and those who originally planned to withdraw from the cooperative now don't want to withdraw. A new atmosphere has emerged in the agricultural cooperative. Photo by Ke Ming and Ji Dong (Xinhua News Agency Draft)

　　After the great debate, the cooperative members' love for the cooperative has been further consolidated. Young cooperative member Yu Guizhen often stays in the fields alone after work every day, carefully picking up the tobacco leaves that have fallen on the ground one by one. Her behavior of cherishing public property has motivated many people.

　　After the great debate, the patriotic ideology of the cooperative members has been enhanced. This is the first production team leader, Zhao Laode, and the accountants carefully checking the fields to determine the output, so as to serve as the basis for the autumn harvest distribution and the payment of public grain to the state.

　　大辩论后正气上升
    吉林省东辽县渭滨乡大榆农业生产合作社，经过社会主义大辩论以后，社员们普遍受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，坚定了立场，明辨了是非，生产积极性空前提高，原来在劳动中不听从分配的听从分配了，原来打算退社的现在也不退社了。农业社中呈现出一片新的气象。　　　　可明、纪栋摄（新华社稿）
　　社员的爱社思想，经过大辩论更加巩固。青年社员于桂贞，每天在收工以后，常常一个人留在田间把掉在地下的烟叶一个个仔细地拣起来。她的爱护公共财产的行为带动了很多群众。
　　大辩论以后，提高了社员的爱国主义思想。这是第一生产队长赵老德和会计们一起仔细查田定产，以便做为秋收分配和向国家缴纳公粮的依据。
