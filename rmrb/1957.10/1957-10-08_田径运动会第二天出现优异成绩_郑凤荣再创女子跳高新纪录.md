Zheng Fengrong Sets New Women's High Jump Record

(Our Dispatch from Nanjing, October 7th) Twenty finals were held on the second day of the National Track and Field Meet. In the men's Group A high jump final this afternoon, Soviet high jumper V. Sitkin also participated in a demonstration.

The women's Group A 80-meter hurdles final drew the attention of the entire stadium. Participating in the competition were Liu Yuying from Liaoning Province, Liu Zheng from Inner Mongolia, and Wen Yunzhen from Guangxi, among others. Liu Yuying and Liu Zheng had both achieved excellent results of 11.2 seconds in Bucharest in September this year. Wen Yunzhen is the national record holder with 11.5 seconds. Who would win the gold medal in this competition was difficult to predict. As soon as the starting gun fired, the five athletes flew off; Wen Yunzhen from Guangxi took the lead, Liu Zheng ran second, and Liu Yuying third, and this remained the order until the finish line. Wen Yunzhen and Liu Zheng's times were 11.6 seconds, reaching the standard for Master of Sports; Liu Yuying's time was only 11.8 seconds.

The men's Group B 10,000-meter final was also a tense and exciting event, with twenty-three athletes vying on the field. Huo Tianshun, a Henan athlete working at the Xinxiang City Supply and Marketing Cooperative, led for the first dozen laps. Due to his lack of experience, he was overtaken by Zhao Baorong from Tianjin and Huang Zhiyong from the People's Liberation Army in the last lap. All three of their times exceeded 32 minutes and 20 seconds, reaching the standard for first-class athletes.

Shanghai female athlete Ke Xiying is good at both running and jumping. Today, she won first place in the women's Group B 100-meter and long jump with times of 13 seconds and 5.34 meters, respectively.

Master of Sports Li Zhonglin and Zhou Lianli won first place in the men's Group A 400-meter and 110-meter hurdles with times of 50.8 seconds and 15.1 seconds respectively, but their times did not break their own national records.

In the men's Group A high jump final held this afternoon, Li Dapei from Jiangxi won first place with a height of 1.85 meters.

Soviet high jumper V. Sitkin participated in a demonstration, and his performance was warmly welcomed by the audience.

In addition, Xian Shaomei, Liu Xingyu, and Jiang Yumin won first place in the women's Group A shot put, long jump, and 100-meter finals, respectively. Wan Lübo and Zheng Renqiang won first place in the men's Group A 5,000-meter and shot put finals, respectively. Sichuan female athlete Liu Xingyu's long jump result was 5.43 meters, only 2 centimeters short of the national record.

In the high jump competition, one of the women's pentathlon events held last, Zheng Fengrong from Shandong jumped over 1.73 meters. This result broke her record of 1.72 meters set in Berlin a month ago, and is only 3 centimeters away from the world record.

    本报南京7日电　全国田径运动会的第二天，共进行了二十项决赛。在今天下午的男子甲组跳高决赛中，苏联跳高运动员弗·西特金也参加了表演。
    女子甲组八十公尺低栏决赛引起了全场的注视。参加比赛的有辽宁省的刘玉英、内蒙古的刘正和广西的文蕴珍等五人。刘玉英和刘正今年9月在布加勒斯特都曾创造了十一秒二的优异成绩。文蕴珍是十一秒五的全国纪录保持者。在这次比赛中究竟谁夺走金牌？这是很难预料的。枪声一响，五名运动员齐飞；广西的文蕴珍一马当先，刘正跑在第二，刘玉英第三，一直到终点，还是这个顺序。文蕴珍和刘正的成绩是十一秒六，达到运动健将标准；刘玉英的成绩只有十一秒八。
    男子乙组一万公尺决赛也是一个紧张而精彩的项目，二十三名运动员逐鹿场上，在新乡市供销合作社工作的河南运动员霍天顺，在前十几圈一直领先，由于他的经验不够，在最后一圈时被天津的赵宝荣和解放军的黄志勇赶过去了。他们三个人的成绩都超过三十二分二十秒，达到了一级运动员的标准。
    上海女运动员柯细英跑跳都行。她今天以十三秒和五公尺三十四公分的成绩分别取得女子乙组一百公尺和跳远的第一名。
    运动健将李忠林和周连立分别以五十秒八和十五秒一的成绩取得男子甲组四百公尺和一百一十公尺高栏的第一名，但他们的成绩都没有打破他们自己保持的全国最高纪录。
    今天下午举行的男子甲组跳高决赛，江西李大培取得了第一，他的成绩是一公尺八十五公分。
    苏联跳高运动员弗·西特金参加了表演，他的表演受到观众热烈欢迎。
    另外，冼少梅、刘兴玉、姜玉民分别获得女子甲组铅球、跳远、一百公尺决赛的第一名。万吕柏和郑仁强分别获得男子甲组五千公尺、铅球决赛的第一名。四川女运动员刘兴玉的跳远成绩是五公尺四十三公分，和全国最高纪录只差二公分。
    山东的郑凤荣在今天最后举行的女子五项全能之一的跳高比赛中，她跳过了一公尺七十三公分。这个成绩打破了她一个月前在柏林创造的一公尺七十二公分的纪录，再有三公分就和世界最高纪录相等了。
