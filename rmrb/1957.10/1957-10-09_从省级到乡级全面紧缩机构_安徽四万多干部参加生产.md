    From Province to Township Level, Institutions Are Comprehensively Streamlined
    Over 40,000 Anhui Cadres Participate in Production

    (Reported by this newspaper) Anhui Province's administrative organs, enterprises, and institutions are, in conjunction with the rectification campaign, streamlining their structures and staffing. The province's administrative organs, enterprises, and institutions originally had 400,000 personnel, with a plan to reduce this number by 80,000. As of mid-June, according to incomplete statistics, over 57,200 people had already been reduced.

    Organizing transferred cadres to engage in production is the main characteristic of this staffing reduction work in Anhui Province. According to statistics, 90% of the reduced cadres have been transferred to production, with diverse production projects, generally focusing on agriculture, animal husbandry, and processing industries. In the Anqing region, 41 production units of various sizes were established, totaling 167. Among the 65 units that have already commenced production, a few have already become profitable. For example, the lotus root powder processing and brick/tile kiln projects have already generated profits of approximately 11,000 yuan. The transferred cadres engaging in production have been universally welcomed by the masses. For example, some farmers in Huoshan County, moved by the sight of cadres working in the fields, said: "In the past, officials going to the countryside wanted grain and taxes. Now that cadres are transferred to produce and work in the fields, the Communist Party deserves not just ten thousand years, but ten million years!"

    Secondly, a number of personnel who met the conditions and voluntarily wished to return home to engage in production were mobilized to resign and return home to produce. The vast majority of these individuals had joined the workforce not long ago, had a lower level of education, weaker work ability, and were unable to continue working or were not suited for work in government offices. A significant portion of them were grassroots cadres and enterprise administrative personnel or temporary workers who had recently left production. It is understood that, with the exception of a few who were not content with production, they generally performed well after returning to production posts, working hard, actively assisting the work of the township and cooperative, and playing a positive role.

    Finally, the transferred cadres have greatly strengthened the leadership of grassroots units, especially the leadership of agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, the work style of the cadres has also been significantly improved, thus strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses. Among the transferred cadres, over 15,300 were leading backbone personnel, including four provincial department heads, eight bureau chiefs, 31 section chiefs, eight deputy secretaries of the prefectural party committee, 37 deputy commissioners and prefectural party committee department heads, and over 400 county cadres. In Huoshan County, Liu'an Prefecture, among the existing 834 district, township, and agricultural production cooperative cadres, a total of 415, approximately half, were dispatched by the county, district, and township. Among the current 54 secretaries and deputy secretaries of the township party committees, 14 were former district party secretaries, seven were district heads, 30 were district party committee members, and only three were general cadres. Among the current 96 directors and deputy directors of agricultural cooperatives, 47 were former deputy district heads and district party committee members, 43 were township party secretaries and township heads, and only six were general cadres. After the streamlining of institutions, not only has the work efficiency of government offices been improved, helping to overcome bureaucracy and red tape, and not only has the leadership over grassroots work been strengthened, but also over 30 million yuan can be saved annually on administrative expenses alone.

    One of the major experiences gained by Anhui Province in this streamlining work is that political and ideological education work is considered to be the primary work throughout the entire process of streamlining institutions and reducing cadres, and is the key to ensuring the successful completion of this task. After the reorganization began, staff members developed various unnecessary ideological concerns and misconceptions. The general manifestations were: being attached to city and office life, fearing hardship in the countryside, looking down on physical labor, and being unwilling to participate in production or resign and return home; fearing demotion and salary reduction after being transferred, facing livelihood difficulties and not receiving subsidies; fearing that being dismissed or participating in production would be looked down upon by others, causing embarrassment. Therefore, they were ideologically uncooperative, complaining, and making strange remarks. In response to this situation, Anhui Province carried out the following work for the transferred cadres: (1) Emphasized the importance of strengthening the lower levels, overcoming departmentalism, and mobilizing leading comrades to take the lead in requesting transfer, which played a driving role. (2) Specifically stipulated the conditions for cadres to be transferred and conducted a relatively strict review. The Provincial Party Committee stipulated that cadres transferred to work in rural areas must meet the following conditions: be familiar with rural work, have been tempered by the land reform or agricultural collectivization movement; be healthy and have an upright work style; be able to connect with the masses and have a certain prestige among the masses. The 494 people uniformly transferred by the provincial directly affiliated organs all underwent individual review by the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, ensuring the quality of the transferred cadres. (3) On the one hand, advocated large-scale and bold transfer, adopting the method of "nomination by the lower level, approval by the higher level," transferring a large number of backbone personnel welcomed by the masses; on the other hand, proposed that party committees at all levels must comprehensively plan and uniformly arrange to prevent blind transfer and the tendency to excessively draw cadres from above. (4) Paid attention to assigning transferred cadres according to their abilities, preventing the use of people for purposes for which they are not suited. And, based on the specific circumstances of each person, tried to transfer them to their place of origin and areas they were familiar with, and tried to accommodate them to be with their spouses.

### 从省级到乡级全面紧缩机构  安徽四万多干部参加生产

    从省级到乡级全面紧缩机构
    安徽四万多干部参加生产
    本报讯　安徽省行政机关和企业、事业单位正在结合整风，紧缩机构和编制。全省行政机关和企业、事业单位原有四十万人，计划减少八万人，到六月中旬，据不完全的统计，已减少了五万七千二百余人。
    组织下放干部进行生产，是安徽省这次紧缩编制工作的主要特点。据统计，在减少的干部中有百分之九十转入生产，生产项目是多种多样的，一般以农业、畜牧业、加工业为多。安庆地区筹办的生产单位共有四十一项，大小一百六十七个，现在已投入生产的六十五个单位中，少数已能赢利。如藕粉加工和烧砖、瓦窑两项，已经赢利约一万一千余元。下放干部转入生产以后受到群众的普遍欢迎。如霍山县有的农民看到干部下地生产以后感动地说：“以前当官的下乡，要粮要税，现在干部下放，下田生产，共产党不光要万岁，还要万万岁！”
    其次，还动员了一批有条件并自愿回家生产的人员，退职回家生产。这些人绝大部分是参加工作不久，文化水平较低，工作能力较弱，不能继续工作和不适于机关工作的。其中有很大一部分是刚脱离生产不久的基层干部和企业的行政管理人员或临时工人。据了解，除少数不安心于生产外，一般回到生产岗位以后，表现还好，努力生产，主动的帮助乡、社工作，发挥了积极作用。
    最后，下放的干部还大大地加强了基层单位的领导，特别是加强了农业社的领导，同时干部的作风也有了显著的改进，因而密切了党和群众的关系。在下放的干部中，有一万五千三百余名是领导骨干。其中有省委部长四人，厅局长八人，处长三十一人，地委副书记八人，副专员和地委部长三十七人，县干部四百多人。六安专区霍山县现有的八百三十四名区、乡和农业生产合作社的干部中，共有四百十五人即一半左右是由县、区、乡下派的；现任五十四个正副乡党委书记中，原任区委书记的十四人，区长的七人，区委委员的三十人，一般干部只有三人；现任九十六个正副农业社主任中，原任副区长、区委委员的四十七人，乡支书、乡长的四十三人，一般干部只有六人。机构紧缩以后，不但提高了机关工作效率有助于克服官僚主义、文牍主义，不但加强了对基层工作的领导，而且每年仅仅行政经费一项，即可节约三千多万元。
    安徽省在这次精简工作中取得的重大经验之一，就是认为政治思想教育工作是贯穿整个紧缩机构减少干部过程的首要工作，是保证能否顺利完成这一任务的关键。在整编开始以后，工作人员产生种种不必要的思想顾虑和错误认识，一般的表现是：留恋城市和机关生活，怕到农村吃苦，轻视体力劳动，不愿参加生产或退职回家；怕下放后降职降薪，生活困难得不到补助；怕退职或参加生产，别人瞧不起，丢人。因而思想不通，发牢骚，说怪话。针对这种情况，安徽省对下放的干部，进行了以下的工作：（一）强调加强下层的重要性，克服本位主义思想，发动领导同志带头请求下放，起了推动作用。（二）具体规定了下放干部的条件，进行了比较严格的审查。省委规定下放农村工作的干部，必须具备下列条件：熟悉农村工作，经过土改或农业合作化运动的锻炼；身体健康，作风正派；能联系群众，在群众中有一定威信的。省的直属机关统一下放的四百九十四人，都经过了省委组织部的逐个审查，保证了下放干部的质量。（三）一方面提倡大量大胆的下放，采取“下边提名，上级批准”的办法，下放了大批群众欢迎的骨干；另一方面又提出各级党委必须全面规划，统一安排，防止盲目下放，把上边干部抽得过空的偏向。（四）对于下放干部注意了量材使用，防止用非所长。并根据每个人的具体情况，尽量下放到原籍和工作熟悉的地区，并尽量照顾能和爱人在一起。
