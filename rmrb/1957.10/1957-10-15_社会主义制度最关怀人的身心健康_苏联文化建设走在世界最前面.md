Socialist System Cares Most About People's Physical and Mental Health
    Soviet Cultural Construction Leads the World
    Seven Thousand Five Hundred Books Published Every Minute

    This newspaper comprehensively reports: According to Xinhua News Agency, the Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of the variety and number of books published, with an average of 7,500 books published every minute.

    In 1913, Tsarist Russia only published 26,200 kinds of books, totaling 86.7 million copies, averaging only half a book per person. Last year, the Soviet Union published 59,500 kinds of books, doubling the number before the revolution; a total of 1,100,750,000 copies were printed, an increase of more than eleven times compared to before the revolution. According to statistics from the United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization, the world averages only two books per person per year, but in the Soviet Union, there are an average of five books per person, and this number is still increasing.

    No country in the world attaches as much importance to the publication of scientific books as the Soviet Union. For example, in 1955, scientific books published in the Soviet Union accounted for 59% of the total number of books published nationwide; while the United States only accounted for 20%, Britain 22%, and France 28%.

    The Soviet people love literary works. The publication of literary books alone has increased more than sixfold since the war. In the past forty years, Gorky's works alone have been published more than 88 million copies. In 1956, literary works accounted for one-third of the books published in the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the publication of children's books. From 1918 to 1956, in the thirty-nine years, the country published more than 50,000 kinds of children's books (excluding textbooks), totaling more than 1.6 billion copies.

    The Soviet Union also ranks first in the world in translating and publishing foreign books. Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, 15,971 books by 1,872 authors have been translated into Russian and the languages of various Soviet nationalities and published. This is almost eighteen times more than the translated works published in the United States during the same period.

    Number of Libraries and Book Collection Ranks First in the World

    The Soviet Union not only ranks first in the world in the variety and number of books published, but also greatly exceeds Western capitalist countries in the number of libraries and the collection of books in libraries.

    According to statistics, there is one public library for every 1,400 people in the Soviet Union; while there is only one public library for every 21,600 people in the United States, and as many as 82,000 people in Britain. If the collection of all public libraries in the Soviet Union is averaged according to the population, there are 332 volumes per 100 people, while the United States only has 88 volumes, and the situation in Britain is slightly better than in the United States, but it only has 117 volumes.

    Statistical materials published in Soviet newspapers show that in the forty years after the October Revolution, the Soviet book industry has been developing at a very high speed. At present, there are 150,000 public libraries in the Soviet Union alone, almost ten times more than in pre-October Revolution Russia, with a collection of 667 million volumes, an increase of more than seventy-three times. If other types of libraries are included, the total number of libraries in the Soviet Union has reached 400,000, with a collection of 1.05 billion volumes.

    An Average of One Athlete for Every Ten Residents

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th: (Reporter Li Ke) For the past forty years, sports activities in the Soviet Union have become the most widespread mass movement. Now, on average, almost one in ten residents in the Soviet Union is an athlete.

    The reporter interviewed Danilova, the Deputy Chairman of the Sports Commission of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. When talking about the development of sports in the Soviet Union, she said: "Before the October Revolution, there were about 50,000 athletes in Russia, mostly from the bourgeoisie and aristocratic landlords. Currently, the Soviet Union has a sports organization network that penetrates every village and factory. There are more than 200,000 sports organizations in various regions, with about 19 million athletes engaged in various activities such as playing ball, swimming, skiing, shooting, and parachuting under the leadership of these organizations. According to the Soviet population, athletes engaged in sports activities account for almost one-tenth of the total population. Other residents, although not members of sports organizations, engage in physical exercise based on their interests and hobbies, regardless of age.

    Currently, Soviet athletes are engaged in forty kinds of sports activities, and are world champions in eight sports such as skiing, shooting, gymnastics, women's volleyball, women's skating, and classical wrestling. They rank first in Europe in fifteen sports. In the past two years, Soviet athletes have broken their own national records 584 times and world records 190 times. Outstanding athletes such as long-distance runner Kuz, boxer Enjiba Rian, weightlifter Vorobyov, and shooter A. Bogdanov have emerged. The 16th Olympic Games held in Melbourne last winter further demonstrated the strength of Soviet sports. The Soviet Union won 37 gold medals and 61 other medals, surpassing the United States in both the number of medals won and the total score.

    Now the life expectancy of Soviet people has increased from an average of 30 years before the revolution to 64 years. This is inseparable from the improvement of people's living standards and medical, health, and healthcare work, but physical exercise also plays a significant role in people's health and longevity.

    社会主义制度最关怀人的身心健康
    苏联文化建设走在世界最前面
    每一分钟出版七千五百册书
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：苏联在书籍出版的种数和册数方面现在占世界第一位，目前平均每一分钟就出版七千五百册书。
    在1913年，沙皇俄国仅出版了二万六千二百种书，共八千六百七十万册，按人口平均每人只有半本书。去年，苏联就出版了五万九千五百种书，比革命前增加了一倍；共印行了十一亿零七百五十万册，比革命前增加了十一倍多。根据联合国教育、文化、科学组织的统计，世界上每人每年平均只有两本书，但在苏联每人平均有五本书，并且还在增加。
    世界上没有任何国家像苏联一样重视科学书籍的出版。例如，1955年苏联出版的科学书籍占全国出版总册数的59％；而美国只占20％，英国占22％，法国占28％。
    苏联人民热爱文艺作品。仅战后文艺书籍的出版就增加了六倍多。四十年来，仅高尔基的作品就出版了八千八百多万册。在1956年苏联出版的书籍中，文艺著作占三分之一。
    苏联很重视儿童读物的出版。从1918年到1956年的三十九年间，全国出版了五万多种儿童书籍（不包括课本），共十六亿多册。
    苏联在翻译出版外国书籍方面在世界上也占第一位。苏维埃政权成立以来，有一千八百七十二个作者的一万五千九百七十一种书籍被译成俄文和苏联各民族的文字出版。这差不多比美国同一时期出版的翻译作品多十八倍。
    图书馆数目和藏书量居世界首位
    苏联不仅在出版书籍的种类和册数方面占世界首位，而且在图书馆的数目和图书馆的藏书量方面也大大超过了西方资本主义国家。
    据统计，苏联每一千四百人就有一个公共图书馆；而美国每两万一千六百人才有一个公共图书馆，英国竟高到八万二千人。如果把苏联全部公共图书馆的藏书按人口平均，每一百人有三百三十二册，而美国只是八十八册，英国情况比美国略微强些，但是也只有一百一十七册。
    苏联报刊发表的统计材料表明，在十月革命后的四十年间，苏联的图书事业一直在以很高的速度发展着。目前，仅公共图书馆苏联就有十五万个，几乎比十月革命前的俄国增加了十倍，藏书量是六亿六千七百万册，增加了七十三倍多。如果把其他各种类型的图书馆计算在内，那么，苏联图书馆的总数已经达到四十万个，藏书达十亿五千万册。
    每十个居民平均有一个运动员
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　本社记者李克报道，四十年来，苏联的体育活动成了最广泛的群众性运动。现在全苏联几乎每十个居民中就平均有一个运动员。
    记者访问了苏联部长会议体育运动委员会副主席达尼洛娃，她在谈到苏联体育运动的发展时说：“十月革命前，俄国约有五万名运动员，大多出身于资产阶级和贵族地主，目前苏联拥有深入到每一个乡村、工厂的体育组织网，各地共有二十多万个体育组织单位，约有一千九百万运动员在这些组织的领导下从事打球、游泳、滑雪、射击、跳伞等各项活动，按苏联人口计算，从事体育活动的运动员几乎占全部人口的十分之一。其它居民虽然没有加入体育组织，但是无论老年和少年都根据自己的兴趣和爱好进行体育锻炼。
    现在苏联运动员从事四十种体育活动，而且在滑雪、射击、体操、女子排球、女子滑冰、古典角力等八项运动中居世界冠军地位，在十五种体育运动中占欧洲第一位，在最近两年，苏联运动员连续打破本国纪录五百八十四次，打破世界纪录一百九十次，出现了像长跑家库兹，拳击运动中的恩吉巴里安，举重运动中的沃罗比耶夫，射击运动中的阿·鲍格达诺夫等优秀运动员。去年冬天在墨尔本举行的第十六届奥林匹克运动会更显示了苏联体育力量的强大，苏联获得三十七枚金质奖章，六十一枚其它奖章，无论从所得奖章的数目和得分来说都超过了美国。
    现在苏联人的寿命从革命前的平均寿命三十岁增长到六十四岁，这是和人民生活改善，和医药、卫生、保健工作分不开，但体育锻炼对人身健康和长寿也起了很大作用。
