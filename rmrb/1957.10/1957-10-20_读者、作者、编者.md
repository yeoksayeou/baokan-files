    Continuing the coverage of the streamlining situation at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

    After reading the news about the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant streamlining personnel and the editorial "Streamlining Enterprise Management Institutions with a Revolutionary Spirit" published in your newspaper on September 27th and 28th, I was deeply moved.
    Under the correct leadership of the Party, the comrades of this factory adopted an advanced attitude, vigorously tapped potential, reduced staffing, created wealth for the country, and saved expenses. They are courageous innovators. I believe they will achieve even greater results in their future work. I suggest that your newspaper conduct in-depth reports on their exemplary deeds, and report more on the work situation and effects after the plant streamlined its personnel. We urgently need to understand this.

    Publish more articles analyzing bourgeois individualism

    In this great anti-Rightist struggle, our Party has uncovered many Rightists and anti-Party careerists who have developed from extreme bourgeois individualists. I deeply feel that bourgeois individualism is a major enemy of our Party on the ideological and political fronts. Therefore, I think it is very necessary for the People's Daily to publish some theoretical and guiding articles on overcoming bourgeois individualism. For example: What is the essence of bourgeois individualism? What are its harms? What is the general law of how one degenerates from individualism to being anti-Party and anti-socialist? What are the roots of bourgeois individualism? How should it be prevented? I hope to see articles published that combine theory with practice to elaborate on these issues.

    "Labor day" and labor time should not be confused

    In the news "Wuhou Pear Persists in Participating in Field Labor" on the first page of your newspaper on October 10, it mentioned: "... but he has consistently insisted on participating in field labor, and the actual time spent in physical labor each year is more than one hundred and forty labor days." It is wrong to confuse "labor day" and labor time here. Labor day is a new economic category inherent in socialism. It is a measure of labor in the production of agricultural production cooperatives, and also a measure of the distribution of individual consumption funds. It is not a measure of labor time, and cannot be used to describe labor time.

    A repeat publication error

    There was a news item on page 8 of your newspaper on October 15: "Investigation of Yunnan Yi Language". After reading it, I felt as if I had seen it before. It turned out that it was exactly the same as the content of "Investigation of Yunnan Yi Language" on page 4 of your newspaper on September 24, with only a few individual words changed. Such negligence is not acceptable.
    In addition, there seems to be one incorrect point in this news item. The second paragraph mentions: "... preliminarily classified the Yunnan Yi language into more than four thousand vocabulary words and more than two thousand supplementary vocabulary words." As far as I know, the vocabulary of any language cannot be artificially summarized. We have never heard of researchers of the Chinese language summarizing Chinese vocabulary into several categories. Therefore, the statement "preliminarily classified the Yunnan Yi language into..." is obviously unscientific.

    继续报道石景山钢铁厂精简情况
    读到你报9月27日和28日刊登的石景山钢铁厂精简人员的消息和“用革命的精神精简企业管理机构”社论后，非常感动。
    这个厂的职工同志们在党的正确领导下，采取了先进态度，大力挖掘潜力，压缩编制，替国家创造财富，节省开支，他们是勇于革新的人，我相信他们在今后工作中一定会获得更大的成绩。建议你报对他们的模范事例进行深入报道。对这个厂精简人员以后的工作情况和效果等多作一些报道，我们迫切需要了解呢。

    多发表些分析资产阶级个人主义的文章
    在这次伟大的反右派斗争中，我们党内查出了不少从极端的资产阶级个人主义者发展成的右派分子、反党野心家。我深深地感到：资产阶级个人主义是我们党在思想战线和政治战线上的大敌。因此，我觉得人民日报很有必要在克服资产阶级个人主义方面，发表一些理论性、指导性的文章。比如：资产阶级个人主义的本质是什么？它的危害性怎样？从个人主义堕落到反党反社会主义的一般规律怎样？资产阶级个人主义的根源是什么？应该怎样防止？希望发表些结合实际来阐述这方面问题的文章。

    “劳动日”和劳动时间不能混用
    你报10月10日第一版“武侯梨坚持参加田间劳动”消息中提到：“……但是他始终如一地坚持参加田间劳动，每年实际参加体力劳动的时间在一百四十个劳动日以上”，其中把“劳动日”和劳动的时间混为一谈这是不对的。劳动日，这是一个为社会主义所固有的新的经济范畴。它是农业生产合作社生产中的劳动尺度，同时也是个人消费基金的分配尺度，它并不是劳动时间的尺度，不能够用来说明劳动时间。

    一次重稿错误
    10月15日你报第八版中有一则新闻：“调查云南彝族语言”。我看了以后感到好像已经看过似的，原来这和9月24日你报第四版“调查云南彝族语言”的内容完全一样，仅有个别的字有所改动，这样的疏忽是不应该的。
    此外，这则消息有一处看来是不正确的。第二段中提到：“……把云南彝语初步归为四千多个词汇和二千多个补充词汇”。据我所知，对于任何语言的词汇都不能人为地去归纳，我们从未听说过研究汉语的人将汉语的词汇归纳成为若干。所以说“把云南彝语初步归为……”这样的说法显然是不科学的。
