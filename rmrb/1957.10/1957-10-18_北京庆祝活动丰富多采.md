　　北京庆祝活动丰富多采
    据新华社17日讯　北京人民正在日益广泛地开展庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的活动。
    各个主要街道的宣传窗里已经出现许多反映苏联人民幸福生活和共产主义建设的图片，商店的橱窗里庆祝十月社会主义革命节的标语和招贴画也日益多起来。广播电台每天都定时播送庆祝节目，许多工厂的黑板报、有线广播台都在广泛进行有关节日的宣传。拍摄一部描述中苏两国人民伟大友谊的宽银幕影片的准备工作，也正由中苏两国的电影工作人员共同进行中。
    首都各高等学校为庆祝这一伟大节日，将要陆续举行学术性的报告会和讨论会。
    王府井百货商店的职工为庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年，从8月份起和苏联海参崴百货商店的职工展开了友谊竞赛。北京地质勘探学院的师生，正在积极整理自己采集的矿物、古生物和岩石，作为节日的礼物送给苏联的莫斯科地质勘探学院、列宁格勒矿冶学院、国家基辅大学和塔什干大学的师生。
