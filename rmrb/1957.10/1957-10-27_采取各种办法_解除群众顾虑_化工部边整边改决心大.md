Adopting Various Measures to Alleviate Public Concerns
The Ministry of Chemical Industry is Determined to Rectify While Reforming

(Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports: After the rectification campaign in the Ministry of Chemical Industry entered the third stage, focusing on rectification and reform, a mass upsurge of airing views has emerged since October 14th. As of the 23rd, 1,026 big-character posters had been put up, raising 5,423 opinions.

In the beginning, the masses had concerns in their minds. Some people were afraid of retaliation or being given a hard time. They said, "Overt retaliation is not happening, but covert retaliation is not guaranteed." Others were afraid of being labeled as rightists, saying, "The more you say, the more mistakes you make; the less you say, the fewer mistakes you make; if you say nothing, you make no mistakes; it's better to say less than to say more." Still others said, "All the opinions have been raised already; there are no more to raise; it just depends on whether the leadership will change."

In light of these mentalities, the Ministry of Chemical Industry and its affiliated departments and bureaus took a series of measures to resolve them. First, leading cadres expressed their attitudes orally and in writing, examining their past shortcomings and mistakes. Recently, they also launched a discussion among the masses on the summation of the anti-rightist struggle, focusing on the boundary between rightist remarks and sharp criticism. Minister Peng Tao put forward his determination and specific measures for improving work at a mobilization meeting for the entire staff's rectification campaign. Consequently, the masses reflected: "With the ideological problem solved, we have a basis for raising more opinions."

With ideological preparation, the leadership first mobilized Party members to take the lead in airing their views. For example, by the 18th, the Personnel Department had already had 30 Party members, 16 Youth League members, and 10 members of the masses put up 43 big-character posters. At the same time, 277 opinions had been raised at discussion meetings. In terms of methods for airing views, the masses were given maximum convenience and could freely communicate through various means such as big-character posters, discussion meetings, and individual conversations. Regarding the content of airing views, the most pressing issues for the masses were addressed first. For example, if cadres in the Rubber Industry Bureau had opinions on the welfare subsidies of Office Director Xiao Changhao, everyone would start by talking about these issues; if the Personnel Department had opinions on the organizational changes within the department, everyone would be allowed to air their views from this aspect.

Improving work vigorously and swiftly is the purpose of the rectification campaign and also a powerful driving force for promoting the airing of views at present. The Ministry of Chemical Industry and its affiliated departments and bureaus have all done their best to make immediate changes where possible. Peng Yunying, the librarian of the Rubber Industry Bureau, had not had a job for a long time. After she put up a big-character poster this time, she was assigned a suitable job the next day. Previously, seven boxes of instruments had been backlogged for a long time. After someone put up a big-character poster raising this issue, it was immediately dealt with.

### 采取各种办法　解除群众顾虑  化工部边整边改决心大

    采取各种办法　解除群众顾虑
    化工部边整边改决心大
    本报讯　化工部的整风运动转入以整改为主的第三阶段后，从10月14日起，群众性的鸣放已出现高潮。到23日止，贴出的大字报已有一千零二十六张，提出意见五千四百二十三条。
    在开始的时候，群众的思想中还有顾虑。有的人怕报复、穿小鞋。他们说：“明着报复是没有，暗里报复不敢保”。也有的人怕划为右派，说：“多说多错，少说少错，不说不错，言多必失，少说为佳”。还有的人说：“意见都提过了，没有再提的了，就看领导上改不改。”
    根据这些思想情况，化工部及所属的司、局领导上采用了一系列的措施，加以解决。首先是领导干部用口头和书面等办法表明态度，对过去的缺点错误进行检查。最近又通过发动群众讨论反右派总结的方法，重点讨论了右派言论与尖锐批评的界限。彭涛部长在全部职工整风动员大会上提出了改进工作的决心和具体措施。因而群众反映：解决了思想问题，再提意见心中就有底了。
    有了思想准备，领导上首先发动党员带头鸣放。如人事司到18日为止，已有三十名党员，十六名团员，十名群众贴出了四十三张大字报。同时在座谈会上已提出二百七十七条意见。在鸣放的方法上，给群众以最大的方便，可以利用大字报、座谈会、个别交谈等各种方式自由交谈。在鸣放的内容上，以群众要求最迫切的问题放起。如橡胶工业管理局的干部对办公室主任萧昌浩的福利补助有意见，大家就从这些问题谈起；人事司对司内的机构变动有意见，就让大家从这方面鸣放。
    雷厉风行地改进工作是整风的目的，也是目前推动鸣放的巨大动力。化工部及所属司、局都作到了能立即改的就立即改。橡胶工业管理局的图书管理员彭云英。过去长期没工作，这次贴出大字报后，第二天就给她安置了适当的工作。以前长期积压了七箱仪器，这次有人贴出大字报提出这个问题后，立即作了处理。
