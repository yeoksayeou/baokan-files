Implement the Class Line, Great Debate Will Surely Triumph
    Conclusion of the Jishui County Cadre Meeting on Whether the Grain Problem Can Be Successfully Debated in "Rich Villages"

    This newspaper reports that a debate arose at the Jishui County cadre meeting in Jiangxi Province regarding whether a major debate on the grain problem could be won in "rich villages."

    Jishui County spans both sides of the Gan River. The vast majority of agricultural cooperatives east of the Gan River have an average of more than five mu of land per person, and the masses are accustomed to using more grain, so they are generally called "rich villages." During the meeting, when discussing whether the grain retention standards were sufficient, the cadres working in these areas had great ideological resistance, believing that the grain retention standards were too low. A cadre from Guanshan Township said, "In our township, each person has an average of ten mu of land. Before the unified purchase and sale of grain, after paying the public grain, each person had an average of at least 1,000 jin of grain. Now, with an average grain retention of 480 jin to 520 jin per person, what reason can we use to debate with the masses?" Ye Zixing, secretary of the Communist Youth League of Dongying Township, said, "Don't even mention 520 jin; even if we boldly raise it to 600 jin, it would be strange if the masses didn't have any objections." In short, those who held these ideas firmly believed that unified purchase and sale of grain was an unreasonable thing in "rich villages."

    How was this matter revealed? The meeting calculated an account for Zhongyuan Village in Wucen Township, which is considered a "rich village." In 1948, this village had 18 households (now 24 households) with a total of 607 mu of land, an average of more than 11 mu per person. The grain output was indeed high. In 1948, the village had five households with surplus grain, totaling 19 people, who consumed a total of 14,630 jin of grain throughout the year, including feeding pigs, making wine, and making rice cakes, averaging 770 jin per person. There were four households with enough grain to eat, totaling nine people, who consumed 4,950 jin of grain throughout the year, averaging 550 jin per person. There were nine households lacking grain, totaling 25 people, who consumed 10,500 jin of grain throughout the year, averaging 420 jin per person. The total grain consumption of the above three groups was 30,080 jin, averaging 567 jin per person in the village. According to last year's unified purchase and sale of grain, these 18 households retained a total of 33,350 jin of grain (including feed), averaging 630 jin per person. Comparing before and after unified purchase and sale, the grain retention standard was 63 jin higher after unified purchase and sale. The problem lies only in the change in the distribution relationship, that is, the wealthy households had a reduction of 140 jin per person, while the poor households had an increase of 210 jin per person. Therefore, only a few wealthy households in this village were dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sale, while the majority of farmers said that the unified purchase and sale was very good. For example, the poor peasant Xie Zhuli planted 45 mu of land in 1948 and harvested about 10,000 jin of rice. After paying 2,100 jin of rent rice, 4,500 jin of raw rice, 500 jin of pawned rice, 2,100 jin of meat debt rice, and 700 jin of cattle rent rice, he actually had only 200 jin of rice left. What could he do? He had to put down his sickle and borrow grain from landlords and rich peasants. Although he made some wine and took some meat on credit every year, he usually had more days of being hungry or eating thin porridge.

    At the meeting, such a general account was also calculated for Dongying Township: First, some typical households were found in each class to find out their grain retention standards before liberation. The grain retention standards of each class were roughly as follows: landlords, rich peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants were in one category, which was only a small number of people. They used more grain, about 620 jin per person on average. The average middle peasants were roughly the same as the current standard of 520 jin. The poor peasants (including lower-middle peasants), who accounted for the majority of the population, had only about 450 jin. On the surface, poor people may have made some wine and rice cakes every year, but they usually drank thin porridge more often. Before liberation, 5% of the people in the township were beggars. The township had a total of 4,200 people. According to the above-mentioned grain retention situation of each class, the wealthy households, which accounted for only 30%, had an average of 100 jin more per person than the current grain retention standard, that is, 126,000 jin more grain. The poor households, which accounted for half, had 70 jin less than the current grain retention standard, that is, a total of 147,000 jin less. Then, compared with the two figures, after the unified purchase and sale, the actual amount of grain retention in the township was 21,000 jin more than before liberation, not less.

    Through the above calculations, everyone said, "Now we are bolder and dare to debate with the masses." From the calculations, everyone deeply realized the correctness of the Party's class policy, which was particularly clear in the grain issue. Those who supported the unified purchase and sale and those who opposed the unified purchase and sale were all determined by their class status. Therefore, in carrying out the major debate on the grain problem, it is also necessary to implement the class line and analyze the situation from a class perspective. Only in this way can we clear our minds and achieve a complete victory in the major debate.

　　贯彻阶级路线　大争一定胜利
    吉水县干部会关于在“富村”辩论粮食问题能不能辩赢的结论
    本报讯　在江西吉水县干部大会上讨论开展粮食问题大辩论，发生了一场在“富村”能不能辩得赢的争论。
    吉水县所辖地区跨越赣江两岸，赣江以东绝大多数农业社每人平均有土地五亩多，群众用粮习惯较宽，所以一般称为“富村”。在这次会议上讨论留粮标准够不够的问题时，这些地区工作的干部思想抵触很大，认为留粮标准太低了。冠山乡的干部说：“我们乡里每人平均有十亩田，解放前没有粮食统购统销时，除了完公粮以外，每人平均至少有一千斤粮食；现在每人平均留粮四百八十斤到五百二十斤，拿什么道理去向群众辩论呢？”东营乡团总支书记叶自行说：“不要说五百二十斤，就大胆提到六百斤，群众没有意见都算怪事。”总之，存在这些思想的人，硬认为粮食统购统销在“富村”是一个理亏的事情。
    这个盖子究竟怎么样揭开？会议给属于“富村”之列的五岑乡中元村算了一笔账。1948年这个村有十八户（现在是二十四户），全村有田六百零七亩，每人平均十一亩多，粮食出得确实多。全村在1948年有五户余粮户，共十九口人，包括喂猪、做酒、打米粿等，全年共用粮一万四千六百三十斤，每人平均用粮七百七十斤；有四户够吃户，共九口人，全年用粮四千九百五十斤，每人平均五百五十斤；九户缺粮户，共二十五人，全年用粮一万零五百斤，每人平均四百二十斤。以上三种人全年用粮是三万零八十斤，全村每人平均用粮五百六十七斤。根据去年粮食统购统销中，这十八户共留粮三万三千三百五十斤（包括饲料在内），每人平均达到六百三十斤。统购统销前后对比，是统购统销后比统购统销前留粮标准高了六十三斤。问题只在于分配关系有了变化，即富裕户每人降低了一百四十斤，而贫苦户每人提高了二百一十斤。因此，这个村只是几户富裕户对统购统销不满意，其余大多数农民都说统购统销好得很。如贫农谢竹礼在1948年种了四十五亩田，收谷一万斤左右，其中除交租谷二千一百斤，生谷四千五百斤，典谷五百斤，赊肉谷二千一百斤，牛租谷七百斤以后，实际剩下只有二百斤谷了。怎么办呢？他只得丢下禾镰又要去向地主、富农借谷吃，虽然他也年年要做点酒、赊点肉吃，但平时饱一餐饿一餐，干一餐稀一餐的日子却占多数。
    会上还给东营乡算了一笔这样的大账：先在各阶层中找出了一些典型户，摸清他们在解放前的留粮标准，各阶层的留粮标准大致是，地主、富农和富裕中农为一类，这类人只是少数，他们用粮较宽，每人平均约六百二十斤，一般的中农大致与现在五百二十斤的标准差不多，占人口多数的贫农（包括下中农）只有四百五十斤左右。从表面看，贫民也许年年要做点酒和打些米粿，但平时喝稀饭的时间较多，在解放前全乡还有5％的人讨饭吃。全乡共有四千二百人，根据上述各阶层留粮情况，其中只占30％的富裕户，每人平均比现在的留粮标准要高一百斤，即多用粮十二万六千斤；另外占半数的贫困户，要比现在的留粮标准低七十斤，即共低十四万七千斤。那末两数相比，统购统销后，全乡的留粮数实际数量比解放前是多了二万一千斤，而不是少了。
    通过以上算账，大家都说：“现在胆壮了，敢同群众辩论了。”从算账中，大家深深体会到党的阶级政策的正确性，特别在粮食问题上表现得很清楚，那些人拥护统购统销，那些人反对统购统销，都是由他的阶级地位所决定的。因此，在开展粮食问题的大辩论中，也必须贯彻阶级路线，用阶级的观点来分析情况，只有这样才能清醒头脑，取得大辩论的全面胜利。
