　　We are Old Comrades-in-Arms
　　——An Interview with the Former Commander of the Soviet Volunteer Anti-Japanese Air Force
　　By our correspondent Li He

　　The bond of life and death between people is precious; the bond of life and death between the people of one country and the people of another country is even more precious. The Chinese and Korean peoples have this kind of bond, and the Soviet and Chinese peoples also have this kind of bond. Twenty years ago, Soviet volunteer airmen participated in the air battles defending Wuhan, extending a helping hand to the suffering Chinese people of that time, which was a manifestation of this kind of life-and-death friendship. For many years, I wanted to meet these old friends of the Chinese people. Not long ago, I was fortunate enough to meet Alexander Ivanovich Grisenko, the commander of this air force.

　　Colonel Grisenko has retired. With a sturdy body, an alert face, and tanned skin, he doesn't look like a 53-year-old man. His pace is a bit slower than ordinary people, and his left leg is still straight when he sits. If he doesn't go downhill or climb stairs, he doesn't appear to be a disabled person who has lost his lower left leg below the knee.

　　I glanced at his left leg and asked, "Were you injured in the war?"

　　"Yes, in 1942," he replied with pride. "This is the only memento of a lifetime spent participating in the Soviet Civil War, the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, and the Soviet Patriotic War."

　　"I still clearly remember China. I pay attention to Chinese affairs all the time. When the Chinese People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, I searched for the crossing point on the map, but unfortunately there was no detailed map! How many times have I flown over this Chinese Volga! I clearly remember its magnificent appearance. I heard that a steel factory is to be built in Wuhan. This news makes me as happy as if a steel factory were being built in my hometown. How many times have I fought to defend that city! I heard that a tractor factory is being built in Luoyang. That is also where I fought. I have always paid attention to Chinese affairs as if they were my own."

　　Grisenko's love for China reminded me of what Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long said when they visited the Soviet Union earlier this year. After reviewing the performance of Soviet supersonic aircraft at an airport in Moscow, Marshal He Long said to the Soviet Air Force generals that the Chinese people would never forget the heroic deeds of the Soviet volunteer airmen in defending Wuhan.

　　Yes, in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan... everywhere suffered from the indiscriminate bombing of Japanese bombers. The Soviet volunteer airmen severely suppressed their arrogance and helped the Chinese people vent their anger. The glory of this page of history has not and will not fade with the passage of time. Grisenko recalled the scene of those years.

　　"When we airmen had the opportunity to help the Chinese people fight the invaders, no one didn't want to go to China. We became volunteers and went to Wuhan via Urumqi, Lanzhou, Xi'an, and Luoyang. Everyone wanted to fly into the sky immediately and fight the Japanese vultures, because they were too bullying. At that time, Japan knew that the Chinese Air Force was very weak, with only 400 old aircraft, so Japanese bombers broke into the city from low altitude without any resistance and bombed at will.

　　"When we arrived in Wuhan, Japanese planes were planning to bomb the city on a large scale. We were tasked with defending Wuhan. I experienced my first baptism of fire in the skies over Wuhan. That was on April 29, 1938. We were notified that three Japanese bomber squadrons (27 planes) were attacking the city. A black flag was raised on the signal tower: everyone fly into the sky. When I flew into the sky, although I looked very calm on the outside, I was extremely nervous inside. I only wanted to contact the Japanese planes and strike them as soon as possible. Beneath the wings stretched Wuhan, a city of several million people. I was participating in the defense of this city, to protect people from bombing. My heart was filled with a heroic feeling.

　　"The impression of the first battle is forever engraved in my mind. I remember: we formed a six-layered formation in the air to intercept the enemy planes, with the highest layer at 6,500 meters. I was on the fourth layer and saw a series of Japanese bombers flying from the east. They were flying at a speed of 330 kilometers per hour, each plane carrying a ton of bombs. The Japanese pilots spotted us and dared not fly into Wuhan, dropping their bombs and turning around to flee. We rushed up to chase them. Under our fierce fire, the lead bomber of the enemy, like plywood splashed with kerosene, caught fire and fell. Later, we learned that the commander of the Japanese Air Force in the Central China theater was on this plane. Losing their commander, the Japanese planes fled in confusion.

　　"After returning to the airport, we learned that 22 Japanese planes had been shot down in the skies near Wuhan that day. This was a gift for May Day."

　　In these air battles of 1938, this air force of volunteers composed of Soviet volunteer airmen often won with fewer against more. Although the quality of Soviet aircraft was relatively good and the technology of Soviet airmen was relatively superb, the disparity in numbers was huge, the air battles were frequent, and the fighting was difficult.

　　"Once," Grisenko said, "seven of our planes fought against seventy Japanese planes. Under these conditions, we could only fight with tactics that kept us close together. The battle was unprecedentedly long: we fought for a full forty minutes. I felt very tired, with tinnitus, headache, dry mouth, and nausea. Only after defeating the Japanese planes and ending the battle did I breathe a sigh of relief.

　　"One day, July 4th, we had already flown into the sky twice and repelled the Japanese planes, shooting down several of them. But there were only twenty or so fighters in total at our airport, while Japan had eight or nine times more planes than us on this front. They wanted to entangle us, attacking in shifts of two or three groups. We guarded the airport without changing shifts. The alarm sounded again, and our twelve fighters flew to the sky at 5,000 meters to meet the enemy. Suddenly we saw thirty Japanese bombers. We were outnumbered, but we still attacked bravely. Several Japanese planes were shot down, and they hurriedly dropped their bombs and turned to flee. We also flew to our own airport. At that moment, a group of Japanese fighters protecting the bombers, in groups of five, six, or seven, pounced on us like a sudden rain. We didn't have much gasoline or bullets left, but we still accepted this battle, four battles in one day! We won the fourth time, but how strained were our energy and nerves!"

　　"We were fighting for the Chinese people, for justice, at that time," Grisenko said. "Now that People's China has established a strong air force and built modern aircraft factories, how gratifying this is!" Obviously, this gratification is not only because he fought for the Chinese people and had a life-and-death friendship with China, but also because he personally saw how old China was once in a state of bare hands and being bombed at will, and because he personally experienced in China and his own country the significance of air power in national defense.

　　Grisenko is the son of a fitter. He participated in the Soviet Civil War in his youth, but that was in land warfare. After returning from China, on the first day of the outbreak of the Soviet Patriotic War, he met the attacking German planes in the Zhitomir region of Ukraine. His group of airmen, except for him who was over thirty years old, were all young people who had not fought before, but they were all brave people who loved their motherland and hated the enemy. In the first six months, they maintained a ratio of one to seven with the enemy. For every plane they lost, the enemy had to lose seven. Grisenko himself, like the young airmen under his command, like the general Soviet airmen, was filled with the steadfast spirit of defending the socialist motherland.

　　"Once, in 1942," Grisenko said, "three of our fighters encountered seven German fighters. We shot down two of them at once. A fierce battle unfolded. In an instant, an enemy plane was already firing with its tail on us. My plane was hit by shrapnel. I parachuted down from an altitude of 3,500 meters. My left leg was broken, and blood was flowing like a flood. When there were about six minutes left to reach the ground, I gradually lost consciousness. I knew I needed to wrap the injured leg and stop the bleeding, but there were no bandages on hand. The Germans "rescued" me. They shot at the parachute, and the bullets broke several of the parachute's straps. I pulled down the puttees to tie the leg. When I landed, the wind was strong, and I didn't have the strength to gather the parachute. Finally, when I released the parachute, the tourniquet on my leg was also pulled off. The blood started gushing again. At this time, I grabbed a handful of dirt soaked in my blood and stuffed it into the wound. The bleeding finally stopped. Later I was rescued and sent to the airport. There I made deployments for battle before being transported to the hospital.

　　"The doctor injected me with three liters of blood at once. They had never done this before. Transfusing too much blood or losing too much blood can cause death. I survived after being transfused. This was also related to my usual attention to sports and my strong physique. After a few months, the General Headquarters allowed me to go to the front line again. At that time, I commanded a division and fought on the Second Belorussian Front. I hadn't flown for a year. I put on a prosthetic leg, got on the plane, started the engine, and practiced flying. When I had to fly a plane with only foot brakes, the mechanic converted the foot brakes into hand brakes."

　　Grisenko never left the battlefield again until the end of the Soviet Patriotic War, and he was never injured again. After being demobilized in 1948, he wanted to fly jet planes. The doctors repeatedly persuaded him to rest, but he still worked as the captain of a geological survey team for a year and a half, and worked in the Party District Committee for a year.

　　This airman, with thirty years of Party membership and military service, excitedly continued to talk about the growth of the young Soviet airmen. The brilliant example of this older generation inspires and cultivates the younger generation of Soviet airmen.

　　我们是老战友
　　——访苏联前抗日志愿航空队队长
    本报记者  李何
    人和人之间生死的交情是可贵的；一国人民和另一国人民之间生死的交情更是可贵的。中国人民和朝鲜人民之间有这种交情，苏联人民和中国人民之间也有这种交情。二十年前，苏联志愿航空员参加了保卫武汉的空战，向当年苦难的中国人民伸出了援助的手臂，正是这种生死之交的一个表现。多年来，我想会见这些中国人民的老朋友。不久前，我才幸运地遇见了这个航空队的队长亚历山大·伊凡诺维奇·格里申科。
    格里申科上校，已经退伍。结实的身体，机警的脸孔，晒黑的皮肤，看去不像是一个已经五十三岁的人。他的步伐比平常人缓慢一些，坐的时候左腿仍然伸得笔直，要是他不下坡不上台阶，并不显得是失掉左膝盖以下小腿的残废人。
    我瞧一眼他的左腿，问：“战时挂的彩吗？”
    “是的，在1942年，”他不无自豪地回答，“这是参加苏联国内战争、中国抗日战争和苏联卫国战争的一生中唯一的纪念。”
    “至今我清楚地记得中国。我时刻注意中国的事情。当中国人民解放军强渡长江的时候，我在地图上寻找过江地点，可惜没有详细的地图！在这条中国的伏尔加河的上空，我飞翔过多少次呵！我清清楚楚地记得它的壮阔的面貌。我听说要在武汉建设钢铁工厂，这个消息像在我的家乡建设钢铁工厂一样令我高兴。在那个城市上空，我进行过多少次保卫战呵！听说在洛阳正在盖起一座拖拉机工厂。那也是我作过战的地方。我一向像注意本国事情那样注意中国的事情。”
    格里申科热爱中国的心情，使我想起今年年初周恩来总理和贺龙副总理访问苏联时，贺龙副总理在莫斯科一个机场上说的话。在检阅苏联超音速飞机的表演以后，贺龙元帅向苏联空军将领说，中国人民永远不会忘记苏联志愿航空员保卫武汉的英勇事迹。
    是的，抗战初期，上海、广州、武汉……，到处遭受了日本轰炸机的滥炸，苏联志愿航空员狠狠地抑挫了它们的气焰，替中国人民吐了一口气。这一页历史的光辉没有而且也不会随着岁月的迁移而减色。格里申科回忆了当年的情景。
    “我们航空员有机会帮助中国人民打击侵略者的时候，没有一个人不想到中国去。我们成为义勇军，经过乌鲁木齐、兰州、西安、洛阳到了武汉。我们每个人都想立刻飞上天空，和日本的兀鹰搏斗，因为它们欺人太甚了。当时日本知道中国空军很弱，只有四百架旧飞机，所以日本轰炸机毫无阻挡地从低空闯进城市，恣意轰炸。
    “我们到武汉的时候，日机正想大规模轰炸这个城市。我们肩负了保卫武汉的任务。我在武汉上空受了第一次战斗洗礼。那是1938年4月29日。我们得到了通知：有日本三个轰炸连（二十七架）空袭市空。信号塔上挂起黑旗：全体飞上天空去。飞上天空时，我外表虽然非常镇静，心里极为紧张。全心只想赶快接触日机，打击日机。在机翼下伸展着人口几百万的武汉。我已参加保卫这个城市，使人们免遭轰炸，我内心充满豪迈的感觉。
    “第一次战斗的印象永生刻在我的脑子里。我记得：我们在空中布成六层的队列拦截敌机，最高层在六千五百公尺。我在第四层，从高处看到了一连日本轰炸机从东方飞来了。它们以一小时三百三十公里的速度飞着，每架飞机载着一吨炸弹。日本飞行员发现了我们，不敢飞进武汉就把炸弹扔掉，掉过机头就跑。我们扑上去赶。在我们的一阵猛烈射击下，对方的领队轰炸机像泼上煤油燃烧的三合板，着火下坠了。后来知道，在这架飞机上有日本在华中战场的空军指挥官。失掉指挥官的日机，混乱地逃跑了。
    “回机场后知道，这一天在武汉附近天空打下了二十二架日机。这是给五一节的献礼。”
    在1938年的这些空战中，由苏联志愿航空员组成的这一支空中义勇军，经常以寡胜众。虽然苏联飞机的质量比较优良，苏联航空员的技术比较高超，但是众寡悬殊，空战频繁，战斗是艰苦的。
    “有一次”，格里申科说，“我们七架飞机和七十架日机作战。在这种条件下，我们只能用彼此靠紧的战术作战。战斗空前之长：打了整整四十分钟，我感到非常累，耳鸣、头痛、口干、恶心，直到打败日机，结束战斗，才透了口气。
    “有一天，7月4日，我们已经两次飞上天空，打退了日机，击落了其中几架。但是我们的机场上总共只有二十多架驱逐机，而日本在这一线的飞机比我们多八、九倍。他们想纠缠我们，分两三班轮回进袭。我们不换班地守在机场。警报又响了，我们的十二架驱逐机飞上五千公尺的天空去迎击。突然我们看到了三十架日本轰炸机。敌众我寡，可是我们还是勇敢地进攻了。日机被打下了几架，赶紧乱扔炸弹，转身逃跑了。我们也飞向自己的机场。就在这一瞬间，一批掩护轰炸机的日本驱逐机，五、六、七架一群，像骤雨般向我们扑来。我们的汽油和子弹都不多了，我们还是接受了这次战斗，一天四次战斗！我们第四次战胜了，但是我们每个人的气力和神经多么紧张呵！”
    “我们当时是为中国人民，为正义而战的，”格里申科说，“现在人民中国已经建立了强大的空军，已经建设了现代化的飞机工厂，这令人多么高兴！”显然，这种高兴不仅因为他为中国人民战斗过，同中国有生死的交情；而且因为他亲眼看见过旧中国曾经怎样处在赤手空拳、任人空袭的状态；因为他在中国和本国亲身体验过航空力量在国防中的意义。
    格里申科是一个钳工的儿子。他在少年时代参加了苏联国内战争，不过那是在陆地作战。他从中国回来以后，在苏联卫国战争爆发的第一天，就在乌克兰的热托米尔区迎击来袭的德机。他那一团航空员，除了他个人年过三十以外，全是年青人，没有作过战，然而都是热爱祖国、恨透敌人的勇敢的人们。在头六个月中，他们和敌人保持一比七的纪录，他们每消耗一架飞机，敌人要消耗七架。格里申科自己和他指挥下的年青航空员一样，和苏联一般航空员一样，充满着捍卫社会主义祖国的坚毅精神。
    “有一次，在1942年，”格里申科说，“我们三架驱逐机和德军七架驱逐机遭遇。我们一下子打掉他们的两架。恶战展开了。一刹那间，一架敌机已经衔尾开炮射击。我的飞机被弹片击中了。我在三千五百公尺高空跳伞降落。我的左腿被打断，血流如注。在大约还有六分钟即可到达地面时，我逐渐失去知觉。我知道需要把受伤的腿缠起来，把血止住。但是手边没有绷带。德军“搭救”了我。他们向降落伞射击，子弹打断了降落伞上的几条带子，我拉下来绑腿。落地时，刮大风，我没有气力收拢伞，最后，我放走降落伞时，腿上的止血带也被扯走了。血又开始涌出来了。这时我抓了把由我的血浸湿的尘土塞进伤口。血总算止住了。后来我被救了起来，送到机场。在那里我还对战斗作了部署，才被运到医院去。
    “医生一下子给我注射了三公升血。他们从来没有这样做过。输血过量或者流血过多都要死亡。我被输血后又活了。这和我平常注意体育，体格强壮，也有关系。过了几个月，总指挥部允许我再上前线。当时我指挥一个师，在第二白俄罗斯前线作战。已经一年没有飞行了。我带着假腿，坐上飞机，开动马达，练习飞行。我必须驾驶只有脚闸的飞机的时候，机械员就把脚闸改装成手闸。”
    格里申科一直到苏联卫国战争胜利结束，再没有下过战场，再没有受过伤。1948年复员以后，他想驾驶喷气式飞机。医生一再说服他休息，但他还当了一年半地质勘察队队长，在党的区委会工作了一年。
    这位有三十年党龄和军龄的航空员兴奋地继续谈起苏联年青航空员的成长。他们这老一辈的辉煌榜样鼓舞和培育着年青一代的苏联航空员。
