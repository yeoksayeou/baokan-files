That was in the winter of 1949 when I met a Party worker named Wang. Before liberation, the Party sent him to Guilin to do underground work. Unfortunately, one day he was discovered by the enemy. He realized that Kuomintang secret agents were secretly monitoring him. Before being arrested, he managed to notify the underground organization to safely transfer to a combat post. In the Kuomintang prison, he was subjected to severe torture by the enemy, but he never revealed the Party's secrets. He was only released and returned to the team when Guilin was liberated.

One day, I went to Old Wang's home. His room contained two benches, a square table, a thermos, and four teacups. The furnishings were very simple and plain. Just as we were talking, a comrade in charge of general affairs notified him to collect his cotton-padded clothes. He went out and soon returned to the room wearing a new cotton-padded outfit, staggering as he walked. I knew that his legs had not yet recovered because of the cruel electric shocks he had suffered at the hands of the enemy. Old Wang, wearing a brand-new military cotton-padded suit, looked radiant, full of energy, and very happy. I understood the feeling of happiness of a child who had been through storms and returned to his mother's arms, and asked him, "Is this cotton-padded outfit warm?"

"It's extremely warm! I feel warm all over." He patted the thick cotton-padded clothes on his body and continued, "From head to toe, everything belongs to the Party." As he spoke, his face revealed a child-like pure and innocent emotion, a kind of feeling that is difficult to describe in words, the happiest and noblest feeling in the world.

I haven't seen Old Wang for eight whole years. I often miss him, miss his voice and smile, and miss the strong and simple revolutionary feelings of a warrior like him, who escaped death and felt so satisfied to receive a cotton-padded outfit.

    一套新棉衣
    邓燕林
    那是1949年的冬天，我认识一个党的工作者，他姓王，解放前党就派他到桂林做地下工作。不幸，有一天他给敌人发现了，他发觉国民党特务在暗中监视他，在被捕之前，他设法通知地下组织安全转移战斗岗位；在国民党监狱中被敌人严刑拷讯，他始终没有泄露党的秘密。直到桂林解放时他才获释归队。
    一天，我到老王家里玩，他的房间里摆着两只条凳、一张方桌，桌上一个热水瓶四只茶杯，陈设非常简单朴素。正当我们谈话的时候，一个办理总务工作的同志通知他去领棉衣，他出去不久，身上穿着一套新棉衣，踉跄着脚步回到房间里来。我知道，由于他曾经受到敌人残酷的电刑损害的缘故，他的腿部还没有恢复健康。老王穿着一身崭新的军用棉衣，容光焕发，神采奕奕，显得非常高兴，我体会到一个久经风波的孩子重新回到母亲的怀抱里的幸福的感情，问他说：“这套棉衣暖和吗？”
    “暖和极了！全身都觉得暖呼呼的。”他两手拍拍身上厚实的棉衣继续说：“全身上下，从顶到踵，都是属于党的。”他说话的时候，脸上流露出一种孩子般纯洁而天真的感情，一种用语言难以形容出来的世界上最幸福最高尚的感情。
    我和老王离开整整八年不见面了，我常常怀念他，怀念他的声音和笑容，怀念像他这样一个出生入死虎口余生的战士，领到一套棉衣就感到很大的满足的强烈而朴素的革命感情。
