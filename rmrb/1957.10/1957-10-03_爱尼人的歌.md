    Song of the Aini People
    Chen Guifei
    Get out! Get out!
    Ghosts from the sky
    Monsters crawling from the water
    Get out, all of you!
    The Aini people
    Will build a Gelanghe village here!
    The village is surrounded by a hundred thousand mountains
    The village is encircled by ninety thousand seas
    Get out! Get out!
    Man-eating ghosts
    Cattle-biting monsters
    Quick! Quick! Get out!
    The land of the Aini people will not allow you to exist
    Look! Tall mountains are covered with large hospitals
    Livestock farms also appear on the grassy slopes
    Get out! Get out!
    Man-eating ghosts
    Cattle-biting monsters
    In the past, the Aini people
    Lived in an era of crawling on hands and knees
    Without slaughtering cattle to you, you would make trouble
    Now Chairman Mao has come
    The Aini people have stood up
    If ancient trees block us, we will cut them down
    Even tigers must flee from us
    Note: [1] Aini people: A branch of the Honghe Hani ethnic group, scattered in the mountainous areas of Xishuangbanna.
    [2] "Gelanghe": In the Aini language, it means happiness. In 1952, the Aini people scattered in the Menghai area of Banna established the Gelanghe Aini Autonomous Region. Village means village.
    [3] Whenever there is human illness or cattle plague in the village, cattle must be slaughtered to worship ghosts.
    [4] In the past, the Aini people believed that ancient trees were sacred trees that could not be touched.

    爱尼人的歌
    陈贵培
    滚开！滚开
    天上下来的鬼
    水里爬来的怪
    统统给我滚开
    爱尼人〔一〕
    要在这里建立格朗和村?〔二〕
    村?围着十万大山
    村?绕着九万大海
    滚开！滚开
    吃人的鬼
    咬牛的怪
    快！快！滚开
    爱尼人的地方不容许你们存在
    看！高山盖着大医院
    畜牧场也在草坡上出现
    滚开！滚开
    吃人的鬼
    咬牛的怪
    过去爱尼人
    用手爬着走的年代
    不标牛〔三〕你们就作怪
    如今来了毛主席
    爱尼人已经站起来
    古树〔四〕拦着我们就砍倒
    老虎见了我们也得逃
    注：〔一〕爱尼人：是红河哈尼族的一个支系，散居在西双版纳境内各山区。
    〔二〕“格朗和”：爱尼族语，幸福之意。1952年散居在版纳勐海地区的爱尼人民，成立了格朗和爱尼族自治区。村?即村庄。
    〔三〕凡村?里发生人病牛瘟都得标牛祭鬼。
    〔四〕爱尼族人过去认为古树都是碰不得的神树。
