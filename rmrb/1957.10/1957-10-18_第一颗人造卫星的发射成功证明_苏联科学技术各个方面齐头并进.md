Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th dispatch: According to TASS, Alexander Topchiev, Academic Secretary of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said: The launch of the first artificial Earth satellite is not the result of an unprecedented achievement in any one particular field of Soviet science. Soviet science and technology are advancing in all aspects simultaneously.

Academician Topchiev published an article in "Pravda" on the 16th, discussing the various inventions and creations of Soviet scientists. Topchiev listed one by one the scientific and technological achievements that enabled the Soviet Union to launch the world's first artificial Earth satellite.

When talking about the achievements of Soviet physicists, Topchiev first pointed out the further development of theoretical and experimental physics by Soviet scientists. In terms of the peaceful use of atomic energy, the method researched by Academician Veksler can be used to manufacture powerful accelerators. The Soviet Union has built the world's largest 10 billion electron volt proton accelerator according to this method widely adopted by various countries.

Topchiev pointed out that in the research on the use of internal nuclear energy, research is currently underway on how to use high-power pulsed discharges to achieve controllable thermonuclear reactions. If successful, it may be possible for the first time ever to create temperatures above one million degrees under laboratory conditions.

Topchiev pointed out that the research work on high-power gas discharges has gradually enabled the Soviet scientific community to solve a general task of modern science—to build reactors that use heavy hydrogen and super-heavy hydrogen instead of uranium fuel.

When talking about the achievements of Soviet science in radio engineering, Topchiev said that without these achievements, there would be no artificial satellites. He pointed out that the observation of the ionosphere by dozens of Soviet ionospheric observation stations has been going on continuously for twenty-five years. Radio astronomy, a new scientific department, is developing rapidly, and scientific research in semiconductors has reached a wide scale.

Topchiev wrote that Soviet scholars have made many new contributions to the development of theoretical and applied mathematics. The Soviet Union has manufactured a variety of fast computers that can solve a variety of calculations in nuclear physics, aerodynamics, radio engineering, and astrophysics.

Topchiev talked about the solution of a series of specific problems in the physics and technology of reaction motion by the Soviet Union. He pointed out that long before such work was carried out abroad, the Soviet Union had conducted bench tests of rocket engines in the early 1930s, and in 1933, a rocket designed by engineer Tikhonravov was launched. Since 1947, the Soviet Union has regularly used rockets to send instruments into the air to study the upper atmosphere. Soviet scientists observed the condition of animal organisms under conditions of free flight and weightlessness when the rocket entered. Topchiev also pointed out the achievements in instrument manufacturing and optics. He said that this allows us to compete with the United States in the manufacture of giant telescopes.

　　第一颗人造卫星的发射成功证明
    苏联科学技术各个方面齐头并进
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院主席团学术秘书长亚历山大·托普切夫说：第一颗人造地球卫星的发射并不是苏联科学某一个别领域取得空前成就的结果。苏联科学技术是各方面齐头并进的。
    科学院院士托普切夫16日在“真理报”上发表了一篇文章，谈苏联科学家的种种发明创造。托普切夫一一列举了使苏联能够发射世界上第一颗人造地球卫星的种种科学技术成就。
    在谈到苏联物理学家成就的时候，托普切夫首先指出了苏联科学家对于理论物理学和实验物理学的进一步发展。在和平利用原子能方面，用维克斯列尔院士研究出来的方法能够制造出效能强大的加速器。苏联按照这一世界各国普遍采用的方法建造成世界上最大的一台一百亿电子伏特的质子加速器。
    托普切夫指出，在研究利用核内能方面，目前正在研究如何利用大功率脉冲放电来实现可控制的热核反应，此举如果成功，就有可能破天荒第一次做到在实验室条件下造成一百万度以上的温度。
    托普切夫指出，大功率气体放电的研究工作使苏联科学界渐渐可能解决现代科学的一个总任务——建造用重氢和超重氢而不用铀燃料工作的反应堆。
    谈到苏联科学在无线电工程学方面的成就时，托普切夫说，没有这些成就，就不会有人造卫星。他指出，苏联几十个电离层观测站对电离层的观测工作已经不停地进行了二十五年。无线电天文学这一新的科学部门正在日益发展，半导体方面的科学研究工作达到了广泛的规模。
    托普切夫写道，苏联学者对理论数学和应用数学的发展有许多新的贡献。苏联制造出多种快速计算机，能解决核物理学、空气动力学、无线电工程学、天文物理学等方面多种多样的算题。
    托普切夫谈到苏联对反作用运动的物理学和技术方面的一系列具体问题的解决。他指出，远在国外进行这类工作以前，苏联就在三十年代初进行了火箭发动机的架上试验，而在1933年发射了吉洪拉沃夫工程师设计的一枚火箭。从1947年起，苏联开始经常地用火箭把仪器放送到空中，研究大气上层的情况。苏联科学家观察了动物机体在火箭进入自由飞行、物体失去重量的条件下的状况。托普切夫还指出仪器制造和光学方面的成就。他说，这使得我们能以在制造巨型望远镜方面同美国进行竞赛。
