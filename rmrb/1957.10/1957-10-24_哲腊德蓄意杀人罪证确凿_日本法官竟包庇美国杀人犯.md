Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: The presiding judge of the Maebashi District Court in Japan, Yuzo Kawauchi, openly defended the American soldier Zelard's crime of deliberately killing the Japanese woman Nakako Sakai in court on the 22nd. He said to Zelard, who was on trial, "The court does not believe that the shot you fired was intended to hit anyone."

Zelard denied in court on the 22nd the testimonies of American and Japanese witnesses such as Nickel and Eiji Onoseki, who revealed that he had deliberately killed Nakako Sakai. However, he admitted that, as Nickel revealed, he fired two shots at Sakai, instead of just one as he had previously stated.

The American soldier Nickel, who was on duty with Zelard, revealed that Zelard threw out the shell casings during a ten-minute break to lure Sakai to pick them up, and then shot her.

Yuzo Kawauchi, who has consistently favored Zelard during the trial, even brutally intimidated Sakai Nakako's eldest son when he summoned him on the 21st, causing him to be speechless on the spot. At the same time, Kawauchi did not allow Sakai Nakako's daughter, Kayoko Sakai, to answer questions on her behalf, threatening her to the point of tears in court. Kawauchi's public bias towards Zelard's illegal behavior in court has repeatedly aroused dissatisfaction among Japanese reporters present.

    哲腊德蓄意杀人罪证确凿
    日本法官竟包庇美国杀人犯
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本前桥地方裁判所裁判长河内雄三，22日公然在法庭上为美国兵哲腊德蓄意杀害日本妇女坂井奈加子的罪行开脱，他对受审的哲腊德说：“法庭并不认为你开的那一枪是有意打中任何人”。
    哲腊德22日在法庭上否认了奈克尔和小野关英治等美国和日本证人揭露他蓄意杀害坂井奈加子的证辞。但是，他承认，像奈克尔所揭露的，他曾经向坂井开了两枪而不是以前所说的只开了一枪。
    同哲腊德一道执勤的美国兵奈克尔曾经揭露，哲腊德是在十分钟的休息时间内抛出弹壳诱使坂井来拾取，然后枪杀了她。
    在审判中一贯偏袒哲腊德的河内雄三，在21日传讯坂井奈加子的大儿子的时候，竟然对他进行粗暴的恫吓，使他当场说不出话来。同时，河内还不准坂井奈加子的女儿坂井佳代子代答问题，当场把她威胁得哭了起来。河内在法庭上公开偏袒哲腊德的非法行为，曾经数次引起在场的日本记者的不满。
