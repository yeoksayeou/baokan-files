　　Beijing Higher Education Institutions Launch Rectification Movement One After Another
    Speaking Out Will Reach a Climax; Rectification and Improvement Will Gradually Deepen
    (Our Newspaper) News—The rectification movement in the capital's higher education institutions has successively entered the stage of rectifying and improving while rectifying. A new mass upsurge of speaking out is gradually forming in various schools. Responsible persons of the Party committees of many schools have reported to all teachers, students, and staff on the work of rectifying and improving while rectifying, mobilizing everyone to continue speaking out in the form of big-character posters, discussion meetings, etc., to help the Party improve its work. Some Party committees and administrative leaders of schools have also used the form of big-character posters to answer many criticisms and opinions that the masses have already raised.
    Jiang Nanxiang, Secretary of the Party Committee of Tsinghua University, said in his report to all teachers, students, and staff on the 11th that the current stage of the school's rectification work is to first do a good job of rectifying and improving while rectifying. He pointed out that the main content of the current school rectification is: first, to streamline institutions and implement the policy of diligence and frugality in running the school. This work will first be carried out from the two aspects of participating in labor production and saving. A wave of enthusiasm for participating in labor has been set off throughout the school, with more than 2,000 people requesting to be sent down to participate in labor production. The school has initially planned to send down about 170 people this year. Second, it is necessary to improve the work style of Party and League members and cadres. Conscientiously study the opinions put forward by the masses in the speaking out, strictly examine their own work, examine and criticize erroneous ideological styles, thereby raising awareness, improving work, and strengthening ties with the masses. Third, it is necessary to improve the work system and strengthen administrative leadership. Fourth, improve teaching and scientific research. This is the basic task of the school and also the central task of the rectification. Jiang Nanxiang emphasized that the current stage of rectifying and improving while rectifying must give full play to democracy, concentrate forces, go all out, act vigorously and resolutely, and the opinions of the masses must be responsible at all levels and explained one by one. He called on everyone to use various methods to carry out rectification and improvement, especially to make good use of the effective method of big-character posters.
    At present, the Party Committee and administrative leaders of Tsinghua University are preparing to first publicize to the masses, through big-character posters, the criticisms and opinions put forward by the masses in the previous stage and some of the problems that have been resolved. They have decided to further mobilize the masses from this week to set off a climax of improving work.
    He Xilin, Vice President of Beijing Normal University, made a report to all teachers, students, and staff on behalf of the Party Committee on "Rectifying Work Style, Improving Work, and Deepening Socialist Ideological Education." He pointed out that the current central task of the school is to correct shortcomings and errors in work and rectify leadership style. Therefore, we must be determined to improve work, improve it thoroughly, improve it steadily, and improve it accurately. And to do a good job in rectification, the key issue is to fully follow the mass line, and mobilize the masses from beginning to end.
    At present, a mass upsurge of improvement work in Beijing Normal University has already formed. On the 13th, all aspects of the school leadership sorted out and studied the opinions put forward by the masses in the early stage of rectification and replied to the solved problems using big-character posters. Two hundred and sixty-one problems have been solved, accounting for 32.9% of the 793 opinions raised by the masses. In terms of wages and welfare, there were more opinions from the masses. Among the 340 opinions, 122 have been processed and improved. For example, those whose wages were assessed too high and whose welfare benefits were unreasonably distributed have been lowered or withdrawn at their own request. In terms of teaching and scientific research, 114 opinions were put forward, and 25 have been improved. In terms of teaching plans, the problem of the number of educational internships has been resolved. In terms of training teachers, the study period for research classes in biology, chemistry, classical literature, modern Chinese, and folk oral creation has been changed from two years to three years. In addition, some improvements have been made in leadership style, Party-mass relations, and follow-up work on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Because the leadership can improve work thoroughly, it has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to improve work. Nearly 300 big-character posters have appeared in two days. These opinions cover a wide range, and there are many opinions on diligence and frugality in running the school. For example, Meng Zhaolin suggested in a big-character poster that rent subsidies and transportation subsidies should be stopped. Some students proposed that voluntary labor should be regularized and institutionalized, and that the school should hire as few temporary workers as possible to reduce state expenditure. Second-year students in the Department of Mathematics suggested in a big-character poster entitled "Please Help Teaching Assistants Take More Care" that teaching assistants from each department come to study with the students and answer difficult questions at any time.
    After the Party Committee of the Beijing Foreign Trade Institute reported to all teachers, students, and staff, the masses have posted many big-character posters. These big-character posters mainly put forward opinions on teaching work and general affairs work, criticizing the arrangement of teaching tasks and some unreasonable phenomena in the distribution of student grants.
    Yan Ziyuan, Secretary of the Party Committee of Beijing Petroleum Institute, called on all teachers, students, and staff to continue speaking out to help the Party improve its work. The masses have posted many big-character posters, focusing on putting forward opinions on diligence and frugality in running the school, the work style of Party and League members, and teaching work.
    The Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, which launched the upsurge of improvement work earlier, has now moved from the upsurge of mobilizing the masses to post big-character posters to the stage where the leadership studies the opinions of the masses and publicly answers them.
    Many other higher education institutions in the capital, such as Beijing Mining Institute, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Railway Institute, and Beijing Posts and Telecommunications Institute, have also decided to start mobilizing the masses one after another this week to set off an upsurge of rectifying and improving while rectifying.

　　北京高等学校整风运动先后开展
    鸣放将形成高潮　整改正逐步深入
    本报讯　首都高等学校的整风运动已先后进入边整边改阶段，一个群众性的新的鸣放高潮正在各校逐步形成。许多学校的党委负责人已向全校师生员工作了关于边整边改工作的报告，动员大家采用大字报、座谈会等形式继续鸣放，帮助党改进工作。有些学校的党委和行政领导上也采用了大字报的形式，答复了群众已经提出来的许多批评和意见。
    中共清华大学党委书记蒋南翔在11日向全校师生员工作报告时说，目前阶段学校的整风工作，首先是要把边整边改工作做好。他指出，当前学校整风的主要内容是：第一，紧缩机构，贯彻勤俭办学的方针。这一项工作首先从参加劳动生产和节约两方面来进行。全校已经掀起参加劳动的热潮，有两千多人要求下放参加劳动生产。学校已初步计划，今年准备下放一百七十人左右。第二，要改进党、团员和干部的工作作风。认真研究鸣放中群众所提的意见，严格地检查自己的工作，检查批判错误的思想作风，从而提高觉悟，改进工作，密切和群众的联系。第三，要改进工作制度，加强行政领导。第四，改进教学工作和科学研究工作。这是学校的基本任务，也是整风的中心任务。蒋南翔强调指出，目前阶段的边整边改工作，必须充分发扬民主，集中力量，大张旗鼓，雷厉风行，对于群众意见，必须层层负责，件件交代。他号召大家运用各种方式来进行整改，特别是要很好地运用大字报这一有效方式。
    目前，清华大学党委和行政领导上，正准备把前一阶段群众提出来的批评和意见，已经解决的一些问题，先通过大字报的方式向群众公布出来，并决定从本周起进一步深入发动群众，掀起改进工作高潮。
    北京师范大学副校长何锡麟代表党委会向全校师生员工做了“整顿作风，改进工作，深入进行社会主义思想教育”的报告。他指出：目前学校的中心任务是改正工作中的缺点和错误，整顿领导作风。因此，必须下决心改进工作，改得狠、改得稳、改得准。而要作好整风，关键问题在于充分地走群众路线，从头到尾都要发动群众。
    目前，北京师范大学的群众性的改进工作的高潮已经形成了。13日，学校领导的各方面，已把群众在整风初期提出的意见作了整理和研究，利用大字报的方式把解决了的问题作了答复。已经解决了的问题有二百六十一条，占群众所提全部意见七百九十三条的32.9％。在工资和生活福利方面，群众意见较多，三百四十条意见中，已作了处理和改进的有一百二十二条。如对工资评定较高和福利费发放不合理者，已在本人要求下降低或退出。在教学和科学研究方面，提出了一百一十四条意见，已改进了二十五条。在教学计划方面，解决了教育实习次数问题。在培养师资方面，已将生物、化学、古典文学现代汉语、人民口头创作等研究班学习年限由二年改为三年。此外，在领导作风、党群关系、肃反善后工作都作了一些改进。由于领导上能狠狠地改进工作，就大大鼓舞了群众对改进工作的热情。两天中已出现了大字报将近三百篇。这些意见涉及的面较广，对勤俭办学方面提的意见较多。如孟昭麟在大字报上建议停发房租补贴和交通补贴。有的学生提出义务劳动经常化、制度化，尽量使学校少雇临时工，减少国家开支。数学系二年级的学生在一张题为“请助教先生多费心”的大字报上，建议各系的助教来和同学一块上自习，随时解答疑难问题。
    北京对外贸易学院党委在向全校师生员工作报告后，群众已贴出许多大字报。这些大字报主要是对教学工作和总务工作提意见的，批评了教学任务的布置，学生助学金的发放中的一些不合理现象。
    中共北京石油学院党委书记阎子元号召全校师生员工继续鸣放，帮助党改进工作。群众已贴出了许多大字报，着重对勤俭办校、党团员作风和教学工作等方面提出意见。
    掀起改进工作高潮比较早的北京地质勘探学院，现在已由发动群众贴大字报的热潮，进入到领导上研究群众意见，公开答复的阶段。
    首都其他许多高等学校，如北京矿业学院、北京航空学院、北京铁道学院、北京邮电学院等校，也决定从本周开始先后向群众进行动员，掀起边整边改的高潮。
