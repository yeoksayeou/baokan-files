Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The anti-Rightist struggle of the central government departments has achieved a decisive victory. Now, about 60% of the divisions and bureaus have, on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, begun to enter the third stage of the rectification campaign, which focuses on rectifying work style and improving work.

The anti-Rightist struggle has been going on for five months now. In the struggle, a large number of Rightists have been exposed within the central government departments. After fierce debates and criticisms, the Rightists have been completely defeated politically and ideologically, their reactionary features have been thoroughly exposed, Rightist remarks have lost their market, and they have been completely isolated among the masses. At the same time, the political consciousness of the masses has been greatly improved, and they have distinguished between right and wrong. At the same time, all departments have resolutely implemented the spirit of rectifying while rectifying, and have seriously examined and corrected many shortcomings and errors, thereby encouraging the masses' confidence in the rectification campaign. These situations have created favorable conditions for all departments to transition to the third stage of the rectification campaign in a timely manner.

At present, the situation of free airing of views during rectification has already emerged in some of the more advanced units of the central government departments. In some divisions and bureaus under the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Urban Construction, and the Ministry of Public Security, the masses have already begun to mobilize. They have launched discussions on some major issues that need to be improved, and some have started a surge of free airing of views through symposiums and big-character posters. The Basic Construction Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry started on October 7th. Party members and members of the Communist Youth League have taken the lead in airing their views, and many activists in the anti-Rightist struggle have actively participated in the rectification campaign. They have posted more than 100 big-character posters related to business, work style, and systems. The leadership of this bureau has shown great determination. They have adopted the method of airing a batch and rectifying a batch, and reporting to the masses once a week on the rectification situation, thus continuously promoting the rectification campaign to deepen step by step.

The experience of many units shows that the leadership's determination is the central key to successfully carrying out the rectification campaign. The Ministry of Aquatic Products recently held a full mass mobilization meeting. Gao Wenhua, the Vice Minister of the ministry, called on everyone at the meeting to "mobilize and make the fire of rectification burn brightly, and burn away all the mistakes and shortcomings." The ministry has already transitioned to the third stage of the rectification campaign in the entire scope. The leadership of the ministry proposed that the opinions raised by the masses must be implemented item by item and accounted for item by item. In order to deeply lead the rectification campaign and effectively solve some major problems existing in the work, the leading cadres of many departments have personally taken action. Wang Heshou, Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and several vice ministers and other responsible cadres personally led five special problem groups on policy and guidelines, systems, and leadership style, and began to study and solve major problems in these areas.

In order to create a surge of free airing of views, many units paid attention to deeply understanding the ideological situation of leading cadres and the masses at the beginning of the movement, and through various meetings and individual conversations, deeply mobilized them and dispelled their concerns about the rectification campaign. The China Tea Export Company, affiliated with the Ministry of Foreign Trade, widely understood the ideological situation of the masses in advance, and found that some leading cadres had resistance to rectification, some had feelings of weariness, and some showed blind optimism, saying "almost all the corrections have been made." Among the masses, some were afraid that problems would not be solved if they raised their opinions, some were afraid of hurting feelings and making it difficult to work together in the future, and some were afraid of retaliation from the leadership and being criticized for saying the wrong things. The leadership of the Tea Export Company, in response to these ideological situations, repeatedly explained the situation in the Party, the Communist Youth League, and mass meetings to dispel concerns and express the determination of the leadership. At the same time, they sorted out the opinions raised by the masses during the period of free airing of views in the past, and while starting to improve, they encouraged continued airing of views. Now, the concerns of the leading cadres and the masses of this company have been basically eliminated, and the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. Since October 4, a surge of rectification has begun.

Among the 60% of the units that have begun to transition to the third stage of the rectification campaign, most units are currently carrying out preparatory work, such as summarizing the gains and experiences of the anti-Rightist struggle, especially the experience of how to rely on the masses and mobilize the masses, so as to use these experiences to further mobilize the masses to fight against the "three isms." Some units, such as the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Aquatic Products, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Food, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, have also sorted out the criticisms and opinions raised by the masses in the past, and made a general plan for the third stage of the rectification campaign. Many units have organized cadres to study the rectification documents and conduct deliberation and discussion. In order to strengthen leadership, many departments have also enriched and strengthened the working bodies leading the rectification campaign.

    中央国家机关过半数单位的整风运动
    开始进入以整改为主的阶段
    大鸣大放、边整边改的热潮已在一些先进单位出现
    据新华社17日讯　中央国家机关的反右派斗争已取得决定性的胜利。现在已有大约60％的司、局单位在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，开始进入了以整顿作风、改进工作为主的整风第三阶段。
    反右派斗争到现在进行了五个月，在斗争中，中央国家机关内揭露出了一大批右派分子。经过激烈的辩论和批判，右派分子在政治上、思想上被彻底打垮，他们的反动面目彻底暴露，右派言论失去市场，在群众中完全陷于孤立。而群众则政治觉悟大大提高，辨明了大是大非。同时，各机关又坚决地贯彻了边整边改的精神，对许多缺点和错误认真作了检查和改正，因而鼓舞了群众对整风的信心。这些情况就为各机关适时地转入整风第三阶段创造了有利的条件。
    目前，整改的大鸣大放形势已经在中央国家机关的一些先进一步的单位出现。第二机械工业部、商业部、轻工业部、对外贸易部、城市建设部、公安部等所属的一部分司、局中，群众已经开始发动，他们已就一些需要改进的重大问题展开了讨论，有的通过座谈会和大字报等形式开始掀起了大鸣大放的热潮。第二机械工业部基本建设局从10月7日开始。已由党员和团员带头开始鸣放，许多反右派斗争中的积极分子都积极参加整风运动，他们贴出了有关业务、工作作风和体制等方面的大字报一百多张。这个局的领导方面表现了很大的决心，他们采取鸣放一批、整改一批的办法，每周向群众作一次关于整改情况的交代，这样不断地推动整风运动步步深入。
    许多单位的经验表明，领导的决心是顺利开展整风运动的中心关键。水产部在最近举行了全部的群众动员大会，这个部的副部长高文华在会上号召大家“动员起来，把整风的火烧得大大的，把所有的错误和缺点都烧掉”。这个部已经在全部范围内转入整风第三阶段，部的领导提出，对于群众所提的意见，一定要做到条条有着落，件件有交代。为了深入领导整风运动，切实解决工作中存在的一些重大问题，许多机关的领导干部都亲自动手。冶金工业部部长王鹤寿和几位副部长等负责干部亲自领导了关于政策方针、体制制度、领导作风等五个专门问题小组，着手研究解决这些方面的重大问题。
    为了掀起大鸣大放的热潮，许多单位在运动一开始就注意深入了解领导干部和群众的思想情况，并通过各种会议和个别交谈，深入发动，解除他们对整风的顾虑。对外贸易部所属的中国茶业出口公司事先广泛地了解了群众的思想情况，发现有的领导干部对整改有抵触情绪，有的有厌倦情绪，有的表现盲目乐观，说“改的差不多了”。在群众中有的人怕提了意见不解决问题，有的怕伤了感情以后不好共事，还有一些人害怕领导报复，怕说错了受批判。茶业出口公司领导方面针对这些思想情况，分别在党内、团内和群众大会上反复作了说明，解除顾虑，表示领导的决心，同时又把过去群众在大鸣大放时期提出的意见进行了排队，一面着手改进，一面鼓励继续鸣放。现在这个公司领导干部和群众的顾虑已经基本消除，群众热情很高，从10月4日以来已经开始掀起了整改热潮。
    在开始转入整风第三阶段的60％的单位中，目前大多数单位都在进行准备工作，例如总结反右派斗争的收获和经验，特别是如何依靠群众、发动群众的经验，以便利用这些经验为进一步发动群众反对“三个主义”而斗争。有的单位如冶金工业部、水产部、对外贸易部、商业部、粮食部、合作总社等还对过去群众提出的批评和意见，进行了问题排队，作出整风第三阶段的大体规划。很多单位都组织干部学习整风文件，进行酝酿讨论。为了加强领导，许多机关还充实和加强了领导整风的办事机构。
