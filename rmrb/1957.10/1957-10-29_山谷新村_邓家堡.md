    Mountain Valley New Village—Dengjiabao
    Dengjiabao Village in Wushan County, Gansu Province, is a small village on the mountainside of the upper reaches of the Wei River. For many years, due to the severe destruction caused by natural disasters and the oppression and exploitation by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the peasants lived in extreme poverty.
    Dengjiabao is located at an altitude of 1,540 meters and is a dry loess hilly area. Heavy rains often occur in July, August, and September each year, causing very serious soil erosion. As a result of soil erosion, the mountains are bare and the gullies are crisscrossed. In the past, the village's 108 peasant households planted extensively but harvested little every year, and there was no way to improve their techniques. In times of drought, they also had to carry water from the Wei River, three miles away, up the mountain, so people at the foot of the mountain said, "No one marries their daughter to Dengjiabao."
    Since the extensive soil and water conservation work was carried out in 1952, countless contour ditches and reservoirs have been dug on the top of the mountains, ridges have been built, countless terraced fields have been opened, and small earth dams have been built one after another at the bottom of the gullies. Black locust, apricot trees, walnuts, and apples have also been planted in all the ditches and on some of the steep slopes. In this way, by 1955, the wish of preventing water from running off the plains and mud from leaving the gullies was basically realized. In the past few years, the yield of crops has been greatly increased, from an average of 18 jin per mu before liberation to 310 jin. The lives of the peasants have greatly improved. Now, all members of the Dengjiabao Agricultural Cooperative are making unremitting efforts to realize the water conservancy of the mountains. In the near future, Dengjiabao will become a good place with "green mountains and clear waters, and gardens full of flowers and fruits." Xinhua News Agency Reporter Hao Changgeng photographed
    The soil and water conservation work in Dengjiabao has achieved remarkable results in the past few years. Terraced fields have been connected into large tracts of land, creating conditions for mechanized farming. (Attached picture)
    Members of the agricultural cooperative are sowing wheat in a timely manner, striving for a bumper harvest next year.
    Many connected water storage ponds have been built on the top of the mountain, and trees have been planted to prevent soil erosion.
    Female member Kang Qiuge is laughing because the mountain land has grown such plump and strong corn.
    Dry land has been turned into irrigated land, and the yield of millet is expected to reach about 400 jin per mu.

    山谷新村—邓家堡
    甘肃省武山县邓家堡村，是渭河上游半山腰里的一个小村庄。多年来，因受自然灾害的严重破坏，和国民党反动派的压榨和剥削，农民们过着极端贫困的生活。
    邓家堡海拔一千五百四十公尺，是黄土丘陵干旱地区。每年7、8、9月常遇暴雨，水土流失非常严重。水土流失的结果，山光岭秃，沟壑纵横。村里的一百零八户农民，过去年年广种薄收，根本谈不上改进技术。遇到天旱，还要到三里以外的渭河去挑水上山，所以山下的人都说“有女不嫁邓家堡”。
    自1952年广泛开展水土保持工作以来，山顶上挖了数不清的水平沟和蓄水池，修了一条条地埂，开了无数梯田，沟底也筑起了一座接一座的小土坝。在所有的水沟里和一部分陡坡上还栽满了洋槐、杏树、胡桃和苹果。这样从1955年就基本上实现了水不下塬泥不出沟的愿望。几年来，农作物的产量得到很大的提高，由解放前平均亩产十八斤提高到三百一十斤。农民生活有了很大的改善。现在邓家堡农业社的全体社员们，正在为实现山地水利化进行不懈的努力。不久的将来，邓家堡就要变成一个“青山绿水、花果满园”的好地方。　　新华社记者　郝常耕摄

    农业社的社员们及时播种小麦，争取明年大丰收。
    山顶上修了许多连环涝池，并且植上了树木，以防止水土流失。
    女社员康秋歌为山地长出这样丰满结实的包谷而欢笑。
    干旱地变成了水浇地，谷子产量预计每亩可达四百斤左右。
