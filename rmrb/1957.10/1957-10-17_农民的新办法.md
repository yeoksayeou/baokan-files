　　The New Methods of Peasants
　　Tie Yi
    The newspaper says that peasants in Min County, Gansu Province, have conducted a new round of evaluations of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who have joined the commune, based on their performance. Those who have changed from bad to good have their original "labels" removed; those who have changed from good to bad have the removed "labels" put back on. This is because some landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, taking advantage of the rightists' attacks, have again "cocked their tails." Distinguishing between good and bad, removing some labels and putting others back on, is a most benevolent, just, and clear-sighted approach by the peasants under the leadership of the Communist Party, and this method is very effective in solving problems.
    Mentioning "cocking tails" reminds me of "cutting tails." "Cutting tails" originally referred to comrades who had already joined the revolution but were still dragging a "tail" of non-proletarian thought, meaning to point out that by "cutting" off this "tail," they could become proletarianized. However, some people are unwilling to "cut" but instead adopt the method of "tucking tails." When the wind is favorable, they tuck them in tightly, seemingly without a tail at all, but as soon as there is any disturbance, they "cock" them up again. But then they suffer because of the "tail," some having suffered hardships, so they simply cut it off, while others tuck it back in again. But tucking it in will inevitably lead to cocking it again, and after cocking it, they inevitably suffer. This is why some people always feel they are being "rectified."
    But this only refers to people within the ranks of the people. For landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, cutting off their tails is not enough. Like a "dog," if it doesn't first become a person, what's the use of cutting off its "tail"? Cutting off the tail only makes it a "bobtail dog," still full of dog-like nature, and cocking its tail only makes it look more unsightly.
    Landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries are indeed like vicious dogs with a habit of biting people, only they have already been beaten and fallen into the water. The peasants have found a way to deal with them, called "supervising production and reforming through labor." Some, after diligently cultivating their character and working hard in production, undergo a complete transformation and are pulled ashore; this is what is called "removing the label." But some also tuck in their tails and sneak ashore. As soon as the climate changes, they bare their fangs and claws and cock their tails again. However, the peasants have found a new way to deal with them: this is to "put the label back on" and push them back into the water until they can "undergo a complete transformation."
    However, this requires periodic evaluations. During the evaluation, some are good and some are bad, those who have become good are pulled up, and those who have become bad are pushed down. Those who "cock their tails" are "labeled," and as long as they haven't bitten anyone or done anything bad, they are no longer "beaten." In this way, there may be those whose "dog" nature is difficult to change and die in the water, but the majority will be saved and elevated to human beings, which is a most benevolent and just method.
    I believe that this new method of the peasants is worth promoting and can be "institutionalized."

　　农民的新办法
　　铁衣
    报上说：甘肃省岷县农民对入社的地主、富农、反革命分子，根据他们表现的好坏，普遍进行了一次新评审。由坏变好的，摘去原来的“帽子”；由好变坏的把摘去的“帽子”再戴上。因为有些地主、富农、反革命分子，乘着右派分子的进攻，又“翘起了尾巴”。分别好坏，有摘有戴，这是农民在共产党领导下的一种至仁至义至明的作法，而且这方法又是很解决问题的。
    提起“翘尾巴”，便联想到了“割尾巴”。“割尾巴”原是对已经参加了革命但还拖着一条非无产阶级思想“尾巴”的同志说的，意思在指明“割”掉这条“尾巴”，就可以无产阶级化了。但有些人却不愿意“割”，而是采取了“夹尾巴”的方法。在风头顺的时候，夹得紧紧的，似乎也像没有尾巴的一样，但一遇风吹草动，便又“翘”了起来。但紧接着又要因“尾巴”受累，有的吃过苦头，索性便割掉，有些还是再夹起来。但夹起来终免不了要翘的，翘了之后又不免受苦。这就是为什么有些人老觉得自己是挨“整”的原因。
    但这也只是指的人民内部的人。对于地主、富农、反革命分子来说，割尾巴也还不行。好比“狗”，倘不先变成人，割了“尾巴”又怎么样？割掉了尾巴，也不过是一只“秃尾巴狗”，仍然狗性重重，秃起尾巴来增加几分难看而已。
    地主、富农、反革命分子，确像一种咬人成性的凶狗，只是已经被打落水了。农民们找到了一种对付他们的办法，叫作“监督生产，劳动改造”。有些经过潜心养性，努力生产，久之便脱胎换骨，被拉上岸，这就是所谓“摘帽子”。但有些却也夹起尾巴，混上岸来。气候一变，它便又张牙舞爪，翘起尾巴来。然而农民找到了对付他们的新办法：这就是“戴上帽子”，推落水去，直到能“脱胎换骨”为止。
    然而这就需要有定期的评审。评审时有好有坏，变得好了的拉上来，又变坏了的推下去，“翘尾巴”的就“戴帽子”，只要没咬了人，没坏了事，就不再“打”。这样可能有“狗”性难移者老死水中的，但多数却会因此得救升化为人，这办法是仁至义尽的。
    我以为农民的这种新方法，是值得提倡，又可加以“制度化”的。
