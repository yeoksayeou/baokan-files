    Beijing Sees Artificial Satellite
    Satellite to Pass Over Beijing Again This Morning
    Xinhua News Agency, 8th - The Beijing Planetarium organized an observation of the artificial satellite last night.

    According to the time calculated by Soviet scientists for the artificial satellite to pass over Beijing last night – 22:49 Beijing time – dozens of observers used astronomical telescopes of various apertures and wind measuring theodolites to observe. Two people each saw a star flying from south to north in the wind measuring theodolite, passing near the zenith. The star's luminosity was very weak and its speed was slower than that of an ordinary meteor.

    Chen Zungui, the curator of the Planetarium, and other experts from the Planetarium carefully studied the situation seen by the observers. Chen Zungui believes that the star seen by the two people is the artificial Earth satellite.

    Last night, the Beijing Xinhua News Agency's powerful receiving radio station began receiving radio signals from the artificial satellite at 22:36 on 20.005 MHz. At 22:46, the sound weakened, and 40.002 MHz was used for listening. After that, the signal sound was very strong until 22:51. After 22:51, the signal gradually weakened and disappeared.

    Xinhua News Agency, 8th - According to a TASS broadcast, the Soviet artificial satellite will pass over Lanzhou at 22:49 Beijing time on the 8th and over Beijing at 7:12 on the 9th.

    When passing over China, the satellite's direction of travel is:

    It will fly from Yangon, Myanmar at 22:44 on the 8th, reach Lanzhou at 22:49, and then fly northeast to reach Okhotsk, Soviet Union at 22:56.

    It will fly from Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia at 7:09 on the 9th, reach Beijing at 7:12, and then fly southeast to reach Sydney, Australia at 7:35.

    Xinhua News Agency, 8th - Various places in China have repeatedly received radio signals from the Soviet artificial Earth satellite.

    The Hangzhou Meteorological Observatory received six signals one after another yesterday afternoon. The time interval between each signal was roughly the same as the time it takes for the artificial satellite to orbit the Earth once.

    The receiving station of the Chongqing Telecommunications Bureau and the receiving station of the Chongqing Daily both received particularly strong signals from the artificial satellite at 8:50 this morning. This strong signal was the strongest of the six signals received by the receiving station of the Chongqing Telecommunications Bureau since the 6th.

    Shenyang, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and other places have also successively received signals in recent days. (Attached pictures)

    北京看到了人造卫星
    卫星今晨将再过北京
    新华社8日讯　北京天文馆昨晚组织了对人造卫星的观察。
    按照苏联科学家计算出来的人造卫星昨夜经过北京上空的时间——北京时间二十二时四十九分，几十个观察人员利用各种口径不同的天文望远镜和测风经纬仪进行了观察。有两个人各在测风经纬仪中看到有一颗星从南往北飞去，经过天顶附近，这颗星的光度很弱，速度比一般流星慢。
    天文馆馆长陈遵妫和天文馆其他专家根据观察者看到的情况进行了仔细的研究，陈遵妫认为两个人看到的那颗星，就是人造地球卫星。
    昨天晚上，北京新华社强力收讯电台从二十二时三十六分开始，在二○，○○五兆赫收听到人造卫星发出的无线电讯号，到二十二时四十六分，声音减弱，改用四○，○○二兆赫收听，此后到二十二时五十一分之间，收到的讯号声音很强，二十二时五十一分以后，逐渐减弱以至消失。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社广播，苏联人造卫星将在北京时间8日二十二点四十九分经过兰州，9日七点十二分经过北京。
    经过中国时，卫星运行方向是：
    8日二十二点四十四分由缅甸的仰光飞来，于二十二点四十九分到达兰州，随后向东北飞去，于二十二点五十六分到达苏联的鄂霍次克。
    9日七点九分由蒙古的乌兰巴托飞来，于七点十二分到达北京，随后向东南方向飞去，于七点三十五分到达澳大利亚的悉尼。
    新华社8日讯　国内各地屡次收听到苏联人造地球卫星上发出的无线电讯号。
    杭州气象台昨天下午陆续收到六次讯号，每次讯号相隔的时间，大致与人造卫星绕地球一周的时间相同。
    重庆市电信局的收讯台和重庆日报收报台，今天上午八时五十分都收听到了人造卫星上所发出的特别强烈的讯号。这种强烈的讯号，是重庆市电信局收讯台从6日以来收听到的六次讯号中最强烈的一次。
    沈阳、天津、郑州、南京、广州等地，连日来也都陆续收听到了讯号。（附图片）
