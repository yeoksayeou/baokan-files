　　Should the State Cover Apprentices' Family Living Expenses?

　　Who Doesn't Have Parents and Siblings?
　　Master craftsmen, when we see your big-character posters saying that we apprentices live too happily, earning 25 yuan a month is very wealthy, eating costs 15 yuan, and there's still 10 yuan for pocket money, and that we should be satisfied with our lives. But, have you forgotten that everyone has parents, siblings, and family! You also say that earning too much money means we don't know how to handle it and are easily corrupted. May I ask how many apprentices use their wages to buy fabric for clothes and leather shoes? Think about what society was like in the past and what society is like now. You used to be exploited by capitalists, but we are now paid according to our labor. You can't use the old perspective to look at the new society.

　　Apprentices' Pay Should Not Be Too High
　　I think this view is wrong. Because during the apprenticeship, the main thing is to learn skills. The apprentice's wage stipulated by the state is only a living allowance for the apprentice during the learning phase. The state cannot cover all of the apprentice's family living expenses. In addition, the apprentice's labor contribution should not enjoy excessive compensation. At present, in addition to paying apprentices 300 to 348 yuan per year (calculated at a monthly salary of 25 to 29 yuan), according to relevant departments' statistics, the state needs more than 600 yuan per year to train an apprentice, and this doesn't even include the investment in classrooms, welfare facilities, and other basic construction. Think about it, the state is paying so much money for apprentices, can you still say it's too little? If we increase wages to take care of your family life, it will increase the state's burden and be detrimental to socialist construction.

　　Don't Only Think About Personal Matters
　　You say that you have to support your parents, but have you ever thought about how much wealth you create for the country? We should think more about improving productivity and increasing production volume, and we shouldn't just focus on personal matters. You are young, you should concentrate on learning. Why is your mind only filled with money? When we were apprentices, we couldn't even get 29 yuan. The capitalists only gave us money for haircuts and baths. The clothes we wore at that time were all brought from home. The Communist Party educated the master craftsmen, and the master craftsmen selflessly taught you their skills. Now that you have been trained, instead of working hard, you still want this and that, and you look down on the master craftsmen. Put your hand on your heart, where is your conscience?

### 徒工的家庭生活该不该由国家包下来？

　　徒工的家庭生活该不该由国家包下来？
    谁家没有父母兄弟
    老师傅们，当我们看到你们写的大字报，说我们徒工的生活太幸福了，每月拿二十五元很富裕，吃饭十五元，还剩十元零花钱，应该满足自己的生活。可是，你们就忘了，谁家没有父母弟妹呀！你们还说挣钱多了，不会处理，容易腐化。请问有多少徒工拿自己的工资买料子衣服、皮鞋？你们想想，以前是什么社会，现在是什么社会，你们以前是被资本家剥削，我们现在是按劳取酬，不能拿过去旧眼光看新社会。
                                徒工
    徒工的报酬不应太高
    我认为这种看法是错误的。因为在徒工期间，主要是学技术，国家规定的徒工工资只是给徒工本人在学习技术阶段的一种生活补助，国家不能将徒工的家庭生活全部包下来。另外，徒工的劳动贡献，也不应该享受过多的报酬。目前国家每年除了支付给徒工三百元到三百四十八元（以月薪二十五元到二十九元计算）工资外，据有关部门统计，国家培养一个学徒工，每年还需要六百多元资金，而且教室、福利设备及其他基本建设投资还不在内。请想想，国家在徒工身上支付这么多资金，还能说太少么？如果为了照顾你们的家庭生活而提高工资，就会增加国家的负担，就会对社会主义建设不利。

    不能光为个人打算
    你们说，你们要抚养父母，可是你们也不想一想，你们为国家创造了多少财富？我们应该多从生产率的提高、生产量的增长来考虑，不应该单在个人方面来打圈子。年轻轻的，应多集中精力来学习，为什么脑袋里光装些钞票呢？我们当学徒时根本拿不到二十九元，资本家只给理发、洗澡钱。我们那时穿的衣服都是从家里拿来的。共产党教育了老师傅，老师傅才无保留地把技术教给你们。现在把你们培养出来了，不好好工作，还要这要那，看不起老师傅，你们摸一摸，你们的良心在哪里？
