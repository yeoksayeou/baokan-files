Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 3rd - On the evening of the 3rd – the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, the Mongolian Council of Ministers held a reception to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the agreement.

Attending the reception were Mongolian Party and government leaders Avirmed, Sürenjav, Damdin, Molomjamts, and Jagvaral. Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia He Ying, diplomatic envoys from various countries, and representatives of Chinese experts and employees helping with construction in Mongolia also attended the reception.

Mongolian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Avirmed said at the meeting that the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement is a major event for the further development of friendly cooperation between the people of Mongolia and China.

In his speech, he expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people on behalf of the Mongolian Party and government and congratulated the Chinese experts and workers working in Mongolia.

Chinese Ambassador He Ying then said that the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement is a milestone in the history of friendly relations between the two countries. Over the past five years, this agreement has opened up broad avenues for the rapid development of economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. The friendly cooperation between the two countries over the past five years has been satisfactory and encouraging.

He said that the cooperation agreement signed five years ago has not only demonstrated its vitality in the past five years, but will also play a greater role as the economies and cultures of the two countries continue to rise.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 3rd - On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, Tsende, First Deputy Chairman of the Mongolian Council of Ministers and Chairman of the State Planning Committee, met with reporters from Xinhua News Agency and answered questions raised by reporters regarding the significance of the signing of the agreement and the achievements of economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries over the past five years.

Tsende said that the people of Mongolia and China have long had the desire for friendly cooperation. The signing of the cooperation agreement shows the people of the world that this desire has been realized. In my opinion, its significance lies first and foremost in the fact that the friendly cooperation between Mongolia and China, as two members of the big family of the socialist camp, not only conforms to their own vital interests, but is also of great significance for strengthening the strength of the socialist camp. This agreement has become an example of friendly and equal cooperation between large and small countries in Asia on the basis of proletarian internationalism. I also believe that it is of great significance for inspiring the national liberation movement of the Asian people and the struggle of peace-loving people.

Secondly, the friendly cooperation between the Mongolian people and the hardworking and brave people of a country with a history of thousands of years is of great significance for accelerating Mongolia's socialist construction. Because it is more conducive to the Mongolian people to learn from the experience of the Chinese people in socialist construction. The Mongolian people also receive China's selfless assistance.

When talking about the achievements that have been made since the signing of the agreement, Tsende pointed out that over the past five years, economic and cultural friendly cooperation between the two countries in various ways has greatly developed in an all-round way.

In terms of economy, the trade between the two countries based on equality and mutual benefit has developed rapidly. For example, in 1952, Mongolia imported goods worth more than 1.3 million Tugriks from China, which has increased to 40 million Tugriks this year, an increase of 30 times. This rate is rare in international trade relations.

China has also provided Mongolia with economic and technical assistance. The construction projects that China is providing to Mongolia free of charge based on the 1956 bilateral agreement are progressing smoothly.

In terms of cultural cooperation, over the past five years, China has sent four art troupes, including hundreds of people, to visit and perform in urban and rural areas of Mongolia. Chinese films are often shown in Mongolia. Mongolia has also sent three art troupes to China. Chinese artists successfully performed the opera "Three Mountains," which is loved by the Mongolian people. This is a major achievement in cultural cooperation.

When talking about the prospects for economic and cultural cooperation between Mongolia and China, Tsende said that he believes that economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries will develop more extensively, faster, and more effectively. (Attached picture)

    庆祝中蒙经济文化合作协定五周年
    蒙古部长会议举行招待会
    曾德谈中蒙经济文化合作的重大意义
    据新华社乌兰巴托3日电  在3日晚上——中蒙经济及文化合作协定签订五周年的前夕，蒙古部长会议举行了招待会，庆祝这个协定签订五周年。
    出席招待会的有蒙古党和政府的负责人阿维尔齐德、苏伦扎布、达木丁、莫洛姆扎木茨、扎格瓦尔拉。中国驻蒙古大使何英、各国外交使节以及在蒙古帮助进行建设的中国专家和员工代表也出席了招待会。
    蒙古部长会议副主席阿维尔齐德在会上讲话说，中蒙经济及文化合作协定对蒙中两国人民的友好合作的进一步发展是一件重大的事情。
    他在讲话中代表蒙古党和政府向中国人民表示感谢，并且向在蒙古工作的中国专家和工人祝贺。
    中国大使何英接着讲话说，中蒙经济及文化合作协定是两国友好关系史上的里程碑。这个协定在过去的五年中已经为两国间的经济与文化合作的迅速发展开辟了广阔的道路。两国五年来的友好合作是令人满意的和令人鼓舞的。
    他说，五年前签定的合作协定不仅在过去五年中显示了生命力，而且会随着两国经济文化的日益高涨而更加发挥作用。
    据新华社乌兰巴托3日电  蒙古部长会议第一副主席兼国家计划委员会主席曾德，在中蒙经济及文化合作协定签订五周年前夕接见新华社记者，答复了记者提出的关于协定签订的意义和五年来两国经济及文化合作的成就等问题。
    曾德说，蒙中两国人民长期以来就有友好合作的愿望。合作协定的签订向世界人民表明这个愿望已经实现。我认为，它的意义首先在于作为社会主义阵营大家庭里的两个成员的蒙中两国的友好合作，不仅符合自己切身的利益，同时对加强社会主义阵营的力量也有很大的意义。这个协定成为亚洲大小国家在无产阶级国际主义基础上的友好平等合作的范例。我还认为，它对鼓舞亚洲人民的民族解放运动和爱好和平人民的斗争也有很大意义。
    其次，蒙古人民同有着几千年悠久历史的国家的勤劳勇敢的人民友好合作，对加快蒙古的社会主义建设有重大意义。因为它更有助于蒙古人民学习中国人民社会主义建设的经验。蒙古人民并且得到中国的无私的援助。
    曾德在谈到协定签订后已经取得的成就时指出，过去五年，两国经济文化通过各种方式进行全面的友好合作有了很大发展。
    就经济方面看，在平等互利基础上进行的两国贸易发展得很快。例如，1952年蒙古从中国进口了价值一百三十多万图格里克的货物，今年已经增加到四千万图格里克，即增加到三十倍。这个速度在国际贸易关系上是少有的。
    中国还给予蒙古经济及技术上的援助。中国根据1956年两国协定无偿援助蒙古的建设项目正在顺利的进行。
    在文化合作方面，五年来中国派来了包括数百人的四个艺术团到蒙古城乡作访问演出。中国影片经常在蒙古上映。蒙古也曾经派了三个艺术团到中国去。中国艺术家成功地演出了蒙古人民喜爱的歌剧“三座山”。这是文化合作中的重大成绩。
    曾德在谈到蒙中两国经济及文化合作的前景时表示，他相信两国经济及文化合作将更加广泛、更快和更有成效的向前发展。（附图片）
