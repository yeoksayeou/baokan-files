    After a Great Debate, Overcoming the Phenomenon of Concealing Production and Private Distribution
    Agricultural Cooperatives in Yangzhou Prefecture Report Actual Output

    (Our Dispatch) Since Yangzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, comprehensively carried out socialist propaganda in rural areas and conducted extensive airing of views, debate, and contention in nearly a hundred pilot cooperatives, the upright spirit in the countryside has risen, and the evil influence has declined. The "stalemate" in grain issues has been eliminated, and cadres have confessed to the circumstances of concealing production and private distribution. With late autumn crops still in the fields, over 60% of the annual grain purchase task has been completed.

    This summer, Yangzhou Prefecture experienced a reduction of over 200 million jin in summer grain output. Party committees at all levels relaxed their political and ideological work. Rural cadres and the masses were affected by the inflammatory rhetoric of urban rightists, and their morale was relatively unstable. Serious phenomena of withdrawing from cooperatives occurred in Jiangdu and Tai counties. The progress of summer grain procurement was also slow. In the past two months, after the widespread launch of the great socialist debate in rural areas, Party organizations at the county, district, and township levels dispatched more than 4,000 cadres to go deep into the cooperatives to work, and successively trained more than 200,000 grassroots backbone activists. At the same time, debates were launched on issues such as rural grain, cooperativization, and farmers' livelihoods at cadre meetings at all levels. After clarifying right and wrong and raising awareness, cadres reviewed their capitalist thoughts. Some agricultural cooperative cadres, who took the lead in concealing production and private distribution, also took the lead in reporting actual output this time. After advocating honesty and trustworthiness throughout the district, the verified annual grain output was more than 4.6 billion jin, catching up with the bumper harvest years of 1953 and 1955.

    When socialist education began in Xinghua, Tai and other counties, they were busy with autumn harvesting and procurement, and the great debate was not launched, and the phenomenon of concealing production and private distribution was still very serious. The county's leading cadres personally went to the grassroots townships to conduct honest and trustworthy education. After the township and cooperative cadres reported the true situation of output, they recently held centralized training for cadres above the district level to launch extensive airing of views and debate on whether this year's harvest was good or bad. Many cadres analyzed the favorable conditions such as the climate this year being better than in 1955, the average increase in output after cooperativization, and the exchange of improved varieties, and listed many facts of verified output from agricultural cooperatives, proving that this year's grain output was no less than in 1955. After the debate in Xinghua County, each district reported more than 50 million jin of grain. Qiaotou Township in Tai County originally reported 319 jin per mu, but later reported 417 jin truthfully.

    After receiving socialist education, the masses distinguished the boundaries between the two paths. The cooperatives that had collapsed in Jiangdu, Tai and other counties have all been restored, and the farmers who withdrew from the cooperatives have also returned to the cooperatives one after another. The statements of not having enough grain to eat, scolding cadres, and saying that cooperatives are not good have all disappeared. In Sanduo District, Gaoyou County, 127 households that withdrew from the cooperatives and more than 50 individual households actively requested to join the cooperatives.

### 经过大辩论克服瞒产私分现象  扬州专区农业社纷纷报实产量

    经过大辩论克服瞒产私分现象
    扬州专区农业社纷纷报实产量
    本报讯  江苏省扬州专区自全面进行农村社会主义宣传和在近百个试点社大放大鸣大争之后，农村正气上升，邪气下降，粮食问题上的“顶牛”现象消除了，干部纷纷说出瞒产私分的情况。晚秋作物尚在田中，全年征购任务已完成60％以上。
    今年夏季，扬州专区夏熟作物减产二亿多斤，各级党委放松了政治思想工作，农村干部和群众受城市右派煽动言论的影响，情绪比较动荡。江都、泰县两县曾发生严重的闹退社现象。夏粮征购进展也较迟缓。近两个月来农村社会主义大辩论普遍开展后，各县区乡党的组织派出四千多名干部，深入到社进行工作，并先后训练了二十多万基层骨干积极分子，同时在各级干部会上也对农村粮食、合作化、农民生活等问题展开了辩论。分清是非提高觉悟以后，干部检讨了资本主义思想，有的农业社干部带头瞒产私分，这次也带头报出了实际产量。全区在提倡忠诚老实以后，核实全年粮食产量为四十六亿多斤，赶上了1953年和1955年的丰收年景。
    兴化、泰县等县在社会主义教育开始进行时，忙于抓秋收和征购，大辩论没有展开，瞒产私分现象仍很严重。县的领导干部亲到基点乡进行忠诚老实教育，乡社干部报出产量真实情况后，最近又以区为单位集训队以上干部，对今年年景到底好不好展开大放大争。许多干部分析了今年气候比1955年好、合作化后产量平均上升、调换了良种等有利条件，并列举出许多农业社核实产量的事实，证明今年粮食产量不低于1955年。兴化县辩论后，各区多报出五千多万斤粮食。泰县桥头乡原报每亩产三百一十九斤，后实报为四百一十七斤。
    群众受到社会主义的教育后，分清了两条道路的界限。江都、泰县等县闹垮了的社已全部恢复起来，闹退社的农民也已纷纷回社。闹粮食不够吃、骂干部、说合作社不好的言论都已消声匿迹。高邮县三垛区一百二十七户退社户和五十多户单干户都积极要求入社。
