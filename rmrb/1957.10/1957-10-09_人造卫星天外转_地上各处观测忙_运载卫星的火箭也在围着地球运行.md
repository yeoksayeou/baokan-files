Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: TASS reports: As of 6:00 AM Moscow time on October 8th, the artificial satellite had completed forty-six full orbits around the Earth. Numerous scientific stations, observatories, and radio enthusiasts are observing the satellite's movements.

    All one hundred and fifty lunar observation stations established for the International Geophysical Year are now being used to observe the first artificial satellite. Astronomical observers, both professional and amateur radio operators around the world, are staying at their posts day and night, watching the satellite's movements.

    People are observing not only the artificial satellite but also the carrier rocket that brought it into orbit. This carrier rocket is also now orbiting the Earth at roughly the same altitude, about one thousand kilometers from the artificial satellite. The distance between them will change in the future.

    The collected observation and specialized measurement records are constantly being studied.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th dispatch: News today says that residents of Semipalatinsk City in Kazakhstan saw the artificial satellite on the evening of the 6th. They said the artificial satellite looked like a small, bright dot, rapidly traversing the dark sky. Radio signals from the satellite were also clearly received.

    Two Moscow reporters also saw the satellite while flying in an airplane at an altitude of six thousand seven hundred and fifty meters.

    The operation of the world's first artificial satellite has become the focus of attention in various sectors of the Soviet Union. Many places have specially established astronomical and radio observation stations equipped with various specialized instruments to observe the satellite's operation. Some people even fly in airplanes to high altitudes for observation.

    More reports of receiving satellite signals are coming in from various locations.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th dispatch: According to calculations by Soviet scientists, the artificial satellite may fly for more than a year. The satellite's speed will gradually decrease, and it will gradually descend into the atmosphere, eventually burning up like a meteorite. The reason for the decrease in speed is that, although the satellite is flying at an altitude of nine hundred kilometers, there are still atmospheric ions and meteorite dust, which create resistance to the artificial satellite.

    According to Soviet scientists, the satellite is a step forward from intercontinental rockets. Intercontinental rockets only have a speed of six or seven kilometers per second.

    Doctor of Technical Sciences Pokrovsky wrote in "Izvestia" today that even using an atomic engine would not achieve the operating speed of this artificial satellite. He also said that after a series of successful satellite launches, the next step will be to launch a cosmic rocket that orbits the moon.

### 人造卫星天外转　地上各处观测忙  运载卫星的火箭也在围着地球运行

    人造卫星天外转　地上各处观测忙
    运载卫星的火箭也在围着地球运行
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社讯：到莫斯科时间10月8日六点，人造卫星围绕地球运行了四十六整周。许多科学站、天文台和无线电爱好者都在观察人造卫星的运行。
    现在为国际地球物理年而建立起来的一百五十个月球观察站已经全部用来观察人造的第一颗卫星。全世界各地天文观察人员、专业和业余的无线电人员整天守在岗位上注视着这颗卫星的行踪。
    人们在观察的不仅是人造卫星，而且还有那个把人造卫星带到轨道上去的运载火箭。现在，这个运载火箭也在以大约相同的高度环绕地球转动，距离人造卫星约有一千公里。它们之间的距离今后将发生变化。
    收集到的观察和专门测量纪录正在不断地研究中。
    新华社莫斯科7日电　今天的消息说，哈萨克的塞米巴拉丁斯克市的居民在6日晚上看到了人造卫星，他们说，人造卫星像一个发亮的小点，在黑暗的天空中迅速掠过。无线电也清楚地收听到了卫星发出的讯号。
    莫斯科的两位记者在乘坐飞机飞到六千七百五十公尺高空时，也看到了这颗卫星。
    世界上第一颗人造卫星的运行情况成为苏联各方面的注意中心。许多地方专设了拥有各种专门仪器的天文和无线电观测站，对人造卫星的运行情况进行观察。有些人还坐飞机飞入高空去观测。
    各地传来了更多的收到卫星讯号的消息。
    新华社莫斯科8日电　据苏联科学家的计算，人造卫星可能飞行一年以上。这个卫星以后速度将逐渐减慢，逐渐下降到大气层中，最后像陨石那样烧掉。减低速度的原因是，虽然卫星是在九百公里的高空中飞行，但是那里还有大气离子和陨石尘，形成了对人造卫星的阻力。
    据苏联科学家说，卫星比洲际火箭又前进了一步。洲际火箭每秒的速度只有六、七公里。
    技术科学博士波克罗夫斯基今天在“消息报”上写道，使用原子发动机也无法达到这个人造卫星的运行速度。他还说，在一系列卫星发射成功以后，下一步就将发出围绕月亮运转的宇宙火箭。
