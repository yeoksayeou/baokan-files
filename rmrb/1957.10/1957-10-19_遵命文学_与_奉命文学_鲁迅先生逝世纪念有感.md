　　“Commanded Literature” and “Commissioned Literature”
　　— Thoughts on the Anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's Death
　　Zang Kejia
　　At a literary symposium, Feng Xuefeng stood up with flushed face and "reprimanded" Lao She's "Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits," saying it was "worthless"; "even 'Dragon Beard Ditch' is shallow." Behind his back, he made grand pronouncements, saying that Lao She's works were "commissioned literature." The reason was that the first draft of Lao She's "Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits" had been submitted to central leading comrades for comments.

　　Feng Xuefeng classified all the works he disliked as "commissioned literature." He said that Fadeyev's "The Rout" was "something from the heart," while "The Young Guard" was a failure. In Feng Xuefeng's eyes, all socialist realist works that closely combined with the times and promptly reflected the great reality were not "from the heart," were inferior, superficial, and only suitable for middle school and university students. Feng Xuefeng believed that literature and art must not approach reality or get close to politics, otherwise, they could never become truly artistically valuable works. Therefore, he said, "To run a poetry journal, either run a 19th-century poetry journal, or run a 21st-century poetry journal." The implication was very clear.

　　Is it true that if literature and art approach politics, get close to reality, and obey the leadership of the Party's ideology and policies, they become "commissioned literature," and once "literature" is "commissioned," it is utterly useless?

　　Let's take Lu Xun as an example.

　　Lu Xun in his proletarian revolutionary warrior period assessed his early works – "Call to Arms" as "commanded literature." He said that what he obeyed "was the command of the forerunners of the revolution at that time, and also the command I myself was willing to obey..." Lu Xun fought for the revolution all his life, and his works were the sparks of that battle. Lu Xun took obeying the command of the "proletariat" as his supreme glory. During the intense white terror, he firmly believed that "only left-wing literature and art are now suffering with the proletarians, and in the future, they will certainly rise up with the proletarians."

　　Lu Xun regarded obeying the command of the proletariat as an honor, while Feng Xuefeng did exactly the opposite. He took obeying the command of the proletariat and revolutionary leaders as the reason for not being able to write good works, and thereby satirized and reprimanded it. This is where Lu Xun became a literary mentor and Feng Xuefeng finally tore off the mask of a Marxist-Leninist theorist, nakedly revealing his fierce anti-Party and anti-socialist realist true colors.

　　Throughout history, there are probably very few literary works that do not obey or are not commissioned. The key is to see whose or which class's command is obeyed. In the feudal era, there were "imperial poems" and "cabinet styles," which obeyed the command of the emperors. In "The Task and Destiny of 'Nationalist Literature'," Lu Xun severely attacked the national scum Huang Zhenxia because his works were "beneficial to imperialism." This kind of "forerunner for the king" "floating corpse literature" obeyed the command of imperialism. Anyone who has lived in the KMT-controlled areas before liberation knows that the "works" written by Wang Pingling, Chen Jiying, Chen Quan and others obeyed the command of their masters – the Kuomintang fascist reactionary rulers. As for the so-called writers who, as Lenin said, relied on the moneybags of capitalists and obeyed the command of the bourgeoisie, they are everywhere. The United States today is a prominent example.

　　Feng Xuefeng once discussed the third kind of person. Does he not know that in literature, there are no others outside the two major camps of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie? Every writer, visibly or invisibly, consciously or unconsciously, belongs to one of the two. If not one, then the other. Feng Xuefeng satirizes others for writing on the command of the proletariat. What about himself? In my opinion, he obeys the command of the bourgeoisie. In terms of literary thought, he has already admitted to opposing the "political standard" proposed by Chairman Mao, and is in complete agreement and in line with Hu Feng's reactionary theories. Since the days of the League of Left-Wing Writers, he has been wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism to destroy Marxist-Leninist revolutionary literature and art. May I ask, whose or which class's command does this obey? Today, Feng Xuefeng satirizes and reprimands works that cooperate with political tasks as "commissioned literature," but in fact, he himself is no exception. However, because of different political positions and ideological situations, the commands obeyed are also different.

### “遵命文学”与“奉命文学”——鲁迅先生逝世纪念有感

　　“遵命文学”与“奉命文学”
　　——鲁迅先生逝世纪念有感
　　臧克家
    在一次文艺座谈会上，冯雪峰血气偾张的站起来，“申斥”了老舍的“春华秋实”，说它“不成东西”；“连‘龙须沟’也是浅薄的”。他背后又大发宏论，说老舍的这些作品，是“奉命文学”。原因是，老舍的“春华秋实”初稿，曾经请中央领导同志提过意见。
    冯雪峰把他所不喜欢的作品，都划入“奉命文学”之列。他说法捷耶夫的“毁灭”是“从内心出发的东西”，而“青年近卫军”就是失败作品了。在冯雪峰的眼里，凡是密切结合了时代，及时反映了伟大现实的社会主义现实主义的作品，都不是“从内心出发的”，都是低劣的，浮浅的，只能给中学生大学生看看的东西。冯雪峰认为，文艺切不可挨近现实，靠拢政治，如果那样，就决不能成为真正有艺术价值的作品，所以他说“办诗刊，要么办十九世纪的诗刊，要么办二十一世纪的诗刊”，言外之意是十分明显的。
    是不是文艺靠拢政治，挨近现实，听命党的思想、政策的领导，就成了“奉命文学”，而“文学”一“奉命”便一无是处了呢？
    我们就以鲁迅为例来看一看。
    作为无产阶级革命战士时期的鲁迅，评定他早期的作品——“呐喊”是“遵命文学”。他说自己所遵的“是那时革命的前驱者的命令，也是我自己所愿意遵奉的命令……”。鲁迅为革命战斗了一生，他的作品就是战斗的火花。鲁迅以遵“无产阶级”的命为无上光荣，他在白色恐怖十分浓重的时候，坚决相信“惟有左翼文艺现在在和无产者一同受难，将来当然也将和无产者一同起来”。
    鲁迅以遵无产阶级之命为荣，冯雪峰却正相反，他把奉无产阶级和革命领导人的命作为写不出好作品来的原因，并从而讽刺之，申斥之。此鲁迅之成为文艺导师而冯雪峰终于揭去马列主义理论家的画皮赤裸裸地露出了反党、反社会主义现实主义的凶恶原形的所在。
    古今中外的文学作品，不遵命、奉命的恐怕很少。这要看遵奉的是什么阶级、什么人的命。封建时代，有“应制诗”、“台阁体”，这是遵奉了帝王之命的。鲁迅在“‘民族主义文学’的任务和运命”中，对于民族败类黄震遐痛加攻击，因为他的作品“于帝国主义是有益的”，这种“为王前驱”的“流尸文学”，就是遵奉了帝国主义之命的。凡是解放前在蒋管区待过的人，都知道王平陵、陈纪滢、陈铨之流所写的“作品”是遵奉了他们的主子——国民党法西斯蒂反动统治者之命的。至于如列宁所说，依赖资本家的钱袋，遵奉了资产阶级之命而执笔的所谓作家，更是滔滔者天下皆是也。现在的美国就是特出的实例。
    冯雪峰曾经论述第三种人，难道不晓得文学方面，无产阶级和资产阶级两大壁垒之外，更无其他。每一个作家，有形无形、有意无意都归属于两者之一。不入于彼，则入于此。冯雪峰讽刺别人奉无产阶级之命写作，他自己呢？我看，他是奉了资产阶级之命的。在文艺思想上，他已经承认，反对毛主席所提出的“政治标准”，对胡风的反动理论则处处契合，一脉相通。从左联时期起，就披着马列主义外衣破坏马列主义的革命文艺，请问，这到底是遵奉了什么阶级、什么人的命？今天，冯雪峰讽刺、申斥配合政治任务的作品是“奉命文学”，其实，他自己也并不例外，不过各人的政治立场、思想情况不同，因而所奉的命有所不同而已。
