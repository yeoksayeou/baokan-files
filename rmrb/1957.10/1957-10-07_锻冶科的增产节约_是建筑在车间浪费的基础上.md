    The Increase Production and Practice Economy of the Forging Workshop
    Is Built on the Basis of Waste in the Workshop
    The modification of the six-two and six-three main shaft processes by the Forging Workshop was a blind modification without regard to actual conditions. As a result, processing was impossible, affecting assembly. At the factory scheduling meeting, the processing workshop demanded main shafts. The factory director, not understanding the situation, criticized the directors of workshops sixteen and seventeen, saying that the workshops were poor at accepting new technical methods. At this time, the head of the Forging Workshop added fuel to the fire, saying, "It's a problem of workers' fixed quota thinking." But the final result was: one hundred and three six-three main shafts were scrapped, and sixty-six six-two main shafts were scrapped. Thus, they had to process according to the original process. Their modification not only did not save money, but caused waste and forced the workshop to rush to work overtime.

    锻冶科的增产节约
    是建筑在车间浪费的基础上
    锻冶科对六二、六三主轴工艺的修改，是不按实际盲目改的，结果不能加工影响装配。在厂调度会上加工车间要主轴，厂长不了解情况就把十六、十七号车间主任批评一顿，说车间对新的技术办法接受差。这时，锻冶科长又来一个火上加油，说：“是工人定额思想问题。”可是最后得出的结果：六三主轴废掉一百零三根，六二主轴废掉六十六根。这样，只好还得按原来工艺加工。他们这样一改不但没有节约，反造成浪费，还使车间突击加班加点生产。
