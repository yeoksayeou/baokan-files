On the Anti-Rightist Front:

    The Chinese Academy of Sciences has exposed Gu Zhun, a rightist element who infiltrated the Party and served as the Deputy Director of the Comprehensive Inspection Committee.

    During the blooming and contending period, he viciously attacked the Party. He falsely accused the Party's leadership style of being arbitrary, inconsistent, and fleeting, and attacked the Party's cadre policy, mocking those cadres who obeyed the leadership and were loyal to the Party. He said, "What the Party cultivates and relies on are cadres who are obedient and don't use their brains, who go left when the leader says left, and go right when the leader says right, without any independent opinions." He complained of "injustice" for those who were punished in the "Three-Anti" campaign and those who were targets of the anti-espionage campaign.

    Gu Zhun deeply sympathized with the words and actions of the rightists, saying that these rightist remarks expressed what he himself had not said for many years. During the days when the rightist elements created a smoke screen, he gloated and said: "Now even if the 'abbot' wants to come out and admit his mistakes to appease public anger, it is already impossible..."

    Since joining the Party in 1935, Gu Zhun has been dissatisfied with the Party for a long time, demanding independence from the Party, repeatedly making mistakes, and failing to be reformed despite repeated education. Ever since he was removed from his positions as Deputy Minister of the East China Finance Department, concurrently Director of the Shanghai Finance Bureau and Director of the Taxation Bureau, in the "Three-Anti" campaign in Shanghai in 1952 for obstructing the development of the movement, he became even more hateful towards the Party, declaring that he would no longer "rely on the signboard of a Party member to make a living," and that "if I can't be an official, I will be a scholar." He falsely accused Marxism-Leninism of being dogma, and not only did he not study political theory himself, but he also incited others not to study it either.

    The Chinese Academy of Sciences is continuing to expose and criticize this rightist element.

    中国科学院揭发党内右派分子顾准
    中国科学院揭发出混入党内的右派分子——综合考察委员会副主任顾准。
    鸣放期间他对党恶毒攻击。诬蔑党的领导作风是任心所欲，有始无终，一阵风，攻击党的干部政策，讥讽那些服从领导，对党忠心耿耿的干部。他说“党培养和依靠的是服服贴贴不动脑筋的干部，领导说左就左，领导说右就右，毫无独立主见可言”。他为“三反”运动中受处分的人和肃反对象鸣“不平”。
    顾准对右派言行深表同情，说这些右派言论说出了他自己多年没有说出的话。在被右派分子弄得烟雾弥漫的日子里，他却得意地说：“现在即使‘大和尚’想出来认一下错以平民愤也已办不到了……”。  
    顾准自1935年入党以来，长期对党不满，向党闹独立性，屡犯错误，屡教不改。自从1952年在上海“三反”运动中，由于他阻碍运动开展撤销了他的华东财政部副部长兼上海市财政局长、税务局长等职务以后，他对党越加仇恨，声言今后“不靠党员这块招牌吃饭”，“做官不成，就当学者”。他诬蔑马克思列宁主义是教条，自己不学政治理论，还煽动别人也不学习。
    中国科学院对这个右派分子正在继续进行揭发批判。
