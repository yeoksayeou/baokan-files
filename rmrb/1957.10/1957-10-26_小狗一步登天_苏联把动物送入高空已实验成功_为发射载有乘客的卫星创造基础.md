Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th - According to the Soviet "Naval Gazette," the Soviet Union recently successfully experimented with sending several dogs to a high altitude of 200 to 210 kilometers. The experiment showed that the dogs experienced partial or complete weightlessness for up to six minutes, which did not affect their health. The results of the experiment provided materials for manufacturing equipment necessary to ensure the safety of human tissues during spaceflight, making it possible to launch artificial satellites with animal passengers in the near future.

Since 1951, Soviet scholars have been using rockets to send animals to high altitudes for experiments, and have taken a series of protective measures for the animals. In the first stage of the research, dogs were placed in sealed chambers at the head of the rocket and sent to a height of 100 kilometers. Nine dogs participated in the experiment, three of which flew to high altitudes twice. The results of the experiment showed that this did not cause any changes to the health of the dogs.

In subsequent experiments, dogs were placed in non-sealed, projectable, specially made suits inside the rocket, but equipped with oxygen, parachutes, and equipment to ensure the adjustment of physiological functions of the animals during flight. This stage was to study the physiological condition of the animals during flight and ejection. Twelve dogs participated in the experiment, one of which was ejected from an altitude of 75 to 85 kilometers, with a descent time extended to 65 minutes. The other dogs were ejected from 39 to 46 kilometers. These experiments showed that animals could land safely from high altitudes, and no significant changes in physiological functions were found.

    苏联把动物送入高空已实验成功
    为发射载有乘客的卫星创造基础
    新华社莫斯科25日电　据苏联“海军报”报道，苏联最近成功地实验了把几只狗送入二百到二百一十公里的高空。在被实验的狗部分或全部失掉重量达六分钟的情况下，并不曾影响到狗的健康。实验结果为制造保证人身组织在宇宙飞行时的安全所必须的器具提供了材料，使有可能在最近将来发射带有动物乘客的人造卫星。
    自1951年起，苏联学者就用火箭把动物送入高空进行实验，并且对动物采取了一系列防卫措施。在研究的第一阶段，把狗放在火箭头部密封的小室中送入一百公里的高度。有九只狗参加了实验，其中有三只飞入高空两次。实验结果表明，这对狗的健康并没有引起任何变化。
    在以后的实验中，把狗安置在火箭中的不密封的可以投射的特制的衣服中，但是装置有氧气、降落伞和保证动物在飞行时调整生理机能的器具。在这一阶段，是为了研究动物在飞行和被抛出时的生理情况。参加实验的有十二只狗，其中一只被从七十五到八十五公里高空抛射出来，降落时间延长到六十五分钟。其它的狗被从三十九到四十六公里抛射出来。这种实验表明，动物可以从高空安全着陆，没有发现生理机能上显著的变化。
