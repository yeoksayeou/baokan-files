Xinhua News Agency, October 16th: The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held an enlarged meeting at Huairentang, Zhongnanhai, this afternoon to welcome the delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the delegation of the National Assembly of Czechoslovakia.

The head of the Supreme Soviet delegation of the Soviet Union, A. B. Aristov, and the head of the National Assembly delegation of Czechoslovakia, Zdeněk Fierlinger, were invited to deliver speeches at the meeting. In their speeches, they repeatedly emphasized the strong unity among socialist countries under the glorious light of the Great October Revolution, as well as the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and China.

In his speech, Chairman Aristov talked about the great significance of the October Revolution. He said that the October Revolution was not only a great turning point in the lives of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, but also had a tremendous impact on the entire course of world history. It opened a new era in human history, laid the foundation for a new socialist era, and also determined the fate of the collapse of imperialism. Under the influence of the October Revolution, the national liberation movements in colonies and dependencies have gained unprecedented upsurge, and the colonial system of imperialism has also begun to collapse.

Chairman Aristov then pointed out that on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the glorious October Revolution, Soviet science and technology have made brilliant achievements in conquering nature, and have manufactured the world's first artificial satellite and intercontinental missile. These outstanding achievements are not only the victory of Soviet science and the Soviet people, but also once again confirmed the great superiority of the socialist social system over the capitalist social system.

When talking about the delegation's impressions of its visit to China and the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, Chairman Aristov said that the unity of socialist countries is a guarantee for us to achieve success in the common cause of building socialism and communism and consolidating world peace. The foundation of this unity is the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China. The whole world is a witness to the unshakable friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people. The reason why this friendship is unbreakable is because it is based on the common interests of the two peoples, their ideological consistency, and their ultimate goals. No force in the world can separate us.

In his speech, Chairman Fierlinger said that Czechoslovakia's cooperation with socialist countries is constantly deepening. Precisely because Czechoslovakia is a member of the socialist camp, the national survival and national independence of the Czechoslovak Republic can be guaranteed. Fierlinger said that he can declare on behalf of the people of Czechoslovakia that no force in the world can destroy the faithful alliance between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, People's China, and other countries of the socialist camp. Together with the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia will always firmly guard the westernmost outpost of the socialist camp.

In his speech, Fierlinger enthusiastically congratulated the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

Fierlinger also said that the Czechoslovak people are pleased to see that the friendly alliance between the Soviet Union and People's China is constantly being consolidated and deepened. This exciting and encouraging consolidation and development of the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance ultimately shattered all the hopes and attempts of the enemies of socialism to weaken and disintegrate our great socialist camp from within.

The speeches of the heads of the Soviet and Czech parliamentary delegations (full text on page 3) were constantly interrupted by warm applause from the participants.

Before the speeches of the heads of the two parliamentary delegations, Chairman Liu Shaoqi first delivered a welcome speech, expressing warm welcome and heartfelt respect to the distinguished guests. He said that last year, a delegation of our National People's Congress headed by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen visited the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia successively. Now, the delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the delegation of the National Assembly of Czechoslovakia warmly visited our country. Through the mutual visits of our parliamentary delegations, not only have we further developed and consolidated the fraternal friendship between us and the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, but it is also conducive to the cause of maintaining world peace.

The delegation of the Central People's Committee of Prague headed by Mayor A. Svoboda, Academician Yudin, the Soviet Ambassador to China, and Bushnyak, the Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, were also invited to attend today's meeting.

Attending today's meeting were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Luo Ronghuan, Shen Junru, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Vice Premiers He Long, Li Xiannian, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and members of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as people from all walks of life in the capital.

　　在我国人民代表大会常委会的欢迎会议上
    苏捷议会代表团团长发表讲演
    强调在十月革命光辉照耀下社会主义各国的强大团结
    据新华社16日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会今天下午在中南海怀仁堂举行扩大会议，欢迎苏联最高苏维埃代表团和捷克斯洛伐克国民议会代表团。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长阿·鲍·阿里斯托夫、捷克斯洛伐克国民议会代表团团长兹德尼克·费林格应邀在会上发表了讲演。他们在讲演中都一再强调在伟大十月革命光辉照耀下的社会主义各国间的强大团结，以及苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和中国人民之间牢不可破的兄弟友谊。
    阿里斯托夫团长在讲话中谈到了十月革命的伟大意义。他说，十月革命不仅是苏联各族人民生活中的伟大转折点，而且对世界历史的整个进程有着巨大的影响，它开辟了人类历史的新纪元，奠定了社会主义新纪元的基础，同时也注定了帝国主义崩溃的命运。在十月革命的影响之下，殖民地和附属国的民族解放运动获得了空前的高涨，帝国主义的殖民体系也开始崩溃。
    阿里斯托夫团长接着指出，在光荣的十月革命四十周年前夕，苏联的科学和技术在征服大自然方面取得了辉煌的成就，制成了世界上第一个人造卫星和洲际导弹。这些卓越的成就不仅是苏联科学和苏联人民的胜利，而且又一次证实了社会主义的社会制度对于资本主义的社会制度的巨大优越性。
    阿里斯托夫团长在谈到代表团访问中国的观感和中苏两国人民之间牢不可破的友谊时说，社会主义国家的团结一致，是我们在建设社会主义和共产主义，以及巩固世界和平的共同事业中取得成就的保证。这个团结的基础就是苏联和中国之间永恒的和牢不可破的友谊。整个世界是苏联人民和中国人民不可动摇的友谊的见证人。这种友谊之所以牢不可破，是由于它是以两国人民的共同利益，他们的思想和最终目的的一致性作为基础的。世界上没有任何力量能够把我们分开。
    费林格团长在他的讲演中说，捷克斯洛伐克同社会主义阵营各国的合作正在不断加深。正因为捷克斯洛伐克是社会主义阵营中的一个成员，捷克斯洛伐克共和国的民族生存和国家独立才能得到保障。费林格说，他可以代表捷克斯洛伐克全国人民宣称，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏捷克斯洛伐克和苏联、人民中国以及社会主义阵营其他国家之间的忠实的同盟。捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国一起，将永远坚定地守卫着社会主义阵营最西方的前哨。
    费林格在讲演中热情地祝贺伟大十月社会主义革命的四十周年。
    费林格还说，捷克斯洛伐克人民高兴地看到，苏联和人民中国之间的友好同盟正在不断巩固和加深，中苏友好同盟的这种令人兴奋鼓舞的巩固和发展，最终地粉碎了社会主义的敌人想从内部削弱和瓦解我们的伟大社会主义阵营的一切希望和企图。
    苏、捷两国议会代表团团长的演讲（全文见第三版），不断地被与会者的热烈掌声所打断。
    在这两国议会代表团团长讲演以前，刘少奇委员长首先致欢迎词，向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。他说，去年以彭真副委员长为首的我国全国人民代表大会代表团相继访问了苏联和捷克斯洛伐克，现在苏联最高苏维埃代表团和捷克斯洛伐克国民议会代表团热情地访问了我国，通过我们议会代表团的相互访问，不仅进一步发展和巩固了我们之间的兄弟友谊和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，而且也有利于维护世界和平的事业。
    以阿·斯沃波达市长为首的布拉格市中央人民委员会代表团、苏联驻华大使尤金院士、捷克斯洛伐克驻华大使布希尼亚克等都应邀出席了今天的会议。
    出席今天会议的，有副委员长李济深、罗荣桓、沈钧儒、彭真、李维汉、陈叔通，副总理贺龙、李先念，最高人民法院院长董必武，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员和政协全国委员会常务委员，各民主党派和各人民团体的负责人，以及首都社会各界人士。
