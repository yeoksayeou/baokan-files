Workers Improve Ideological Awareness Through Socialist Education
　　Guan Le Ming Gold Pen Factory Transformed

　　(Our Newspaper News) After conducting socialist ideological education among its employees, the Shanghai Joint State-Private Guan Le Ming Gold Pen Factory, which had previously experienced disturbances and declining production, has seen a new atmosphere of unity and progress.

　　In May of this year, an anti-socialist trend stirred up by right-wing elements once affected the Shanghai Guan Le Ming Gold Pen Factory. Some workers, due to unreasonable demands for the distribution of collective welfare funds, caused disturbances. The attendance rate was generally only 40% to 50%, sometimes even less than 30%. The production plan of the main workshops could not be completed. The pass rate of gold pens dropped from 75% to 57%, and the return rate rose from 25% to 34.31%.

　　Recently, the factory's leading cadres systematically and step-by-step carried out a series of socialist ideological education activities for the masses. First, they focused on criticizing the fallacies of the right-wing elements. The main cadres of the factory went to various workshops to report to the masses, clarifying that the purpose of right-wing elements in spreading fallacies was to oppose the Party, the people, and socialism, pointing out the importance of strengthening the unity of the working class, and requiring the masses to ideologically draw a clear line with the right-wing elements. This report improved the awareness of many people. Many workers, especially older workers, used their personal experiences of the changes in life before and after liberation to criticize the fallacies of the right-wing elements. Young workers were also greatly inspired. For example, Wang Jinbao, a relatively backward worker in the plastic molding workshop, said: "I used to be wrong in not obeying assignments and not attending meetings. In the future, I must do a good job in production and unity to fight back against the right-wing."

　　As the socialist spirit began to rise in the factory, they began to conduct labor discipline education for the employees, explaining to the employees how to correctly treat the relationship between production and life, discipline and freedom, centralization and democracy, pointing out the current facts that some employees have excessive demands on life, extreme democratization, and lax labor discipline, and their adverse effects, and mobilizing all workers to summarize the disturbances in May of this year. Should the disturbances have occurred? What harm did they cause? Finally, the leaders reported the summary of the disturbances to the masses, analyzed the causes and lessons of the disturbances, pointed out that the disturbances caused a loss of more than 2,000 yuan in production, examined the shortcomings of the leadership and the responsibilities they should bear, and also pointed out the errors of some workers in the actions they took during the disturbances, and then organized the masses to discuss them. At this time, the righteous spirit of the masses had been established, and their ability to distinguish right from wrong had been improved. They all felt distressed for the losses suffered by the country. Li Senpu, one of the leaders of the disturbances, also made a self-criticism.

　　While carrying out ideological education, the factory's leading cadres also actively improved the shortcomings in their past work style, extensively visited the families of employees, and regularly went deep into the workshops to participate in physical labor. The masses were very satisfied.

　　The situation in the factory also changed suddenly. When the reporter interviewed at the factory, it was on the eve of the National Day. The factory was full of vitality, and good news of production was frequently reported. The pass rate of pens had increased from 57% to 92%, and the damage rate of penholders had dropped from 23% to 10%. The production of the Zhoujiaqiao branch factory has increased sharply. The absenteeism rate of the whole factory has dropped from more than ten percent to less than 1%. The phenomenon of wasting materials has also been greatly reduced. The young workers in the factory also carried out voluntary labor on Sundays, picking out more than 5,000 pen tips from old pen tips that could be repaired and used, saving the country more than 20,000 yuan. The secretary of the factory's general Party branch told the reporter with full confidence: "The rectification movement of the Guan Le Ming factory is about to begin. The confidence and enthusiasm of all the employees in the factory are very high. Through this rectification movement, we will definitely make our factory better." (Ji Yin)

    工人受到社会主义教育思想觉悟提高
    关勒铭金笔厂面貌改观
    本报讯　曾经一度发生闹事、生产下降的上海公私合营关勒铭金笔厂，在对职工进行了社会主义思想教育之后，出现了一片团结进步的新气象。
    今年5月间，右派分子刮起的一股反社会主义的歪风，曾一度影响到上海关勒铭金笔厂，一部分工人曾因无理要求分集体福利金而发生闹事。出勤率一般只有40％到50％，有时甚至不到30％，主要车间的产量计划无法完成，金笔的合格率从75％下降到57％，回修从25％提高到34.31％。
    最近厂的领导干部有计划有步骤地对群众进行了一系列的社会主义思想教育。他们首先是集中批驳了右派分子的谬论。厂的主要干部到各工场向群众作报告，讲清右派分子散布谬论的目的在于反党反人民反社会主义，指出加强工人阶级团结的重要性，要求群众从思想上与右派分子划清界线。这次报告提高了许多群众的觉悟，许多工人，特别是老年工人用解放前后生活改变的切身感受来批驳右派分子的谬论。青年工人也受到很大启发，如压塑车间原来较落后的工人王锦宝说：“我过去不服从调配，不参加会议都是不对的，今后一定要搞好生产，搞好团结来反击右派。”
    由于厂内社会主义正气开始抬头，他们便开始对职工进行劳动纪律教育，向职工说明怎样正确对待生产与生活、纪律与自由、集中与民主的关系，指出当前某些职工生活要求过高、极端民主化和劳动纪律松懈的事实，及其不良影响，并发动全体工人来总结今年5月的闹事，应不应该闹？闹了有什么危害？最后，领导上将闹事的总结向群众作报告，分析了闹事的原因和教训，指出因闹事而使生产受到了二千元以上的损失，检查了领导上的缺点和应负的责任，也指出少数工人在闹事中所采取的某些行动的错误，以后又组织群众讨论。这时，群众中正气已经树立，辨别是非的能力已经提高，都为国家受到损失而痛心。闹事带头人之一李森朴也作了自我检讨。
    在进行思想教育的同时，工厂领导干部并积极改进过去工作作风上的缺点，广泛访问了职工的家庭，定期深入车间，参加体力劳动。群众都很满意。
    工厂的情况也顿然改观了。当记者在工厂采访时，正是国庆节前夕，厂里到处生气勃勃，生产捷报频传，笔的合格率已从57％提高到92％，笔杆损坏率则从23％下降到10％。周家桥分厂的生产更是直线上升。全厂的缺勤率由百分之十几下降到1％还不到。浪费材料的现象也大大减少了。厂内的青工还利用星期天开展了义务劳动，从废旧的笔尖中拣出了五千多只修理后即可用的笔尖，为国家节约了二万多元。工厂的党总支书记对记者满怀信心地说：“关勒铭厂的整风运动即将开始，全厂职工信心与热情很高，通过这次整风运动，一定会把我们的工厂搞得更好。”（季音）
