Xinhua News Agency, Yecheng, 5th — The world's highest highway, the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway, has been completed. A batch of trial-run vehicles has arrived in Gedaik, Tibet, from Yecheng, Xinjiang, in recent days.

    The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway starts from Yecheng in the southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, crosses the Kunlun and Gangdise Mountains, and ends in Gedaik in the Ngari Prefecture of the Tibetan Plateau, with a total length of 1,179 kilometers. 915 kilometers of this highway are at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters above sea level, and 130 kilometers are at an altitude of more than 5,000 meters, with the highest point being 5,500 meters above sea level.

    The average speed of the fully loaded trial vehicles is more than 20 kilometers per hour, and it only takes five days to travel the entire distance from Yecheng to Gedaik.

    There were hundreds of kilometers between Xinjiang and the Ngari region of Tibet that not only had no roads in the past, but had never been inhabited. Only after liberation were camel transportation teams organized to travel between Xinjiang and Gedaik, taking more than a month to complete the journey. After vigorous surveying and mapping with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army and some Uyghur and Tibetan people, the Xinjiang Highway Department found this route in 1954. Construction began in March of last year, and so far, after 19 months, the world's highest highway spanning the Kunlun Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau has been completed.

    新藏公路建成
    据新华社叶城5日电　世界最高的公路——新藏公路已经建成，一批试线汽车在最近几天由新疆的叶城陆续抵达西藏的噶大克。
    新藏公路从新疆维吾尔自治区南部叶城起，越过昆仑山和冈底斯山，到西藏高原阿里地区的噶大克止，全长一千一百七十九公里。这条公路有九百一十五公里在拔海四千公尺以上，在拔海五千公尺以上的线路就有一百三十公里，最高点拔海五千五百公尺。
    满载的试线汽车的行驶速度平均每小时在二十公里以上，从叶城到噶大克全程只需五天。
    新疆和西藏阿里地区之间有几百公里过去不但没有路，也从来没有人迹。解放以后才组织了骆驼运输队往来新疆和噶大克之间，走完这段路程需一个多月。新疆公路部门在人民解放军和一些维吾尔族、藏族人民的协助下，大力进行勘查以后，在1954年找出了这条路线。从去年3月开始施工，到目前为止，经过十九个月，修成了这条横跨昆仑山和西藏高原的世界最高的公路。
