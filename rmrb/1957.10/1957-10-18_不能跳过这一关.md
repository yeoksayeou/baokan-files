　　This Stage Cannot Be Skipped

　　The Socialist Education Movement in the rural areas of Guangdong has been rolled out in two batches, expanding to nearly 20,000 cooperatives, accounting for 40% of the province's agricultural cooperatives. The remaining 60% will soon also launch the Socialist Education Movement. The movement is mainly concentrated in Category Two and Category Three cooperatives, which together account for about 70%. Indeed, Category Two and Category Three cooperatives have the most problems and are most deeply affected by capitalist ideology. It is entirely correct to concentrate efforts on rectifying these cooperatives first. However, some people are now proposing to rectify only backward cooperatives and not Category One cooperatives. They say that Category One cooperatives have "no major problems," that there are too few cadres leading this movement, and they are too busy; at the same time, the autumn harvest is approaching, and time cannot be allocated, etc. The recent meeting of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China specifically criticized this argument, believing that it not only shows a lack of understanding of the significance of the Socialist Education Movement but also indicates that even today, some comrades underestimate the serious situation of the rise of capitalist ideology in rural areas in recent years.
　　The cooperative movement in rural Guangdong has achieved a decisive victory, and the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives are doing very well. No one can deny this fact. However, in the past year, due to the relaxation of political and ideological work, capitalist tendencies in rural areas have developed significantly and, to a large extent, threaten the consolidation of cooperatives. The problems exposed in the Great Blooming and Letting Contend further illustrate the seriousness of this situation. But until today, no basis has been found for the argument that Category One cooperatives are not affected by capitalist ideology and therefore do not need to conduct the Socialist Education Movement. On the contrary, there are many facts that show that this stage cannot be skipped. Let's just cite a few examples!
　　Baitu Township in the Shaoguan Special Zone was originally a model Category Three cooperative in Qujiang County. In the first year of transitioning to advanced cooperatives, they encountered an unprecedented drought that had not occurred in decades. Under the leadership of the Party branch, people overcame the disaster, and grain production did not decrease, while sideline income increased. An agricultural cooperative that has experienced the test of natural disasters should have no problems or "no major problems," right? However, due to the relaxation of political work in recent years, capitalist ideology has taken the opportunity to rise, and in just one year, it has devastated the model cooperative to the "brink of collapse." Houji Cooperative in the Shantou Special Zone was also a Category One cooperative in Huilai County in the early days of cooperation. They had increased rice production by 40.9% in one year. The food ration for cooperative members increased from 290 jin to 380 jin. However, under the instigation of several wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas, the cooperative was dissolved in just a few days. This spring, one workday in Houji Cooperative was as low as 4.8 fen. Within a month of the cooperative's dissolution, twelve poor and lower-middle peasant households sold green crops and transferred land at low prices, and several people took out loans at high interest rates of eight percent. The vigorous vitality of the early days of cooperation was swept away. Sha? Cooperative in the Foshan Special Zone has been a key township in Shunde County from land reform to today. Because there are many Party members and strong cadres, Sha? Cooperative did not have a single household withdraw from the cooperative in the economic crop area where the wave of withdrawals was the fiercest. The leading organs have repeatedly praised them for withstanding storms. However, a recent inspection revealed that there were three teams, about 80 farm households, that had implemented "contracting production to households." Under the guise of "assuming responsibility for profits and losses," they had long become nominal cooperative members. In Sha? Cooperative, there was a member named Liang Ke, who was "the poorest of the poor" before land reform, but now he owns nine dairy cows, three cow workers, two bicycles, and has lent out a large amount of high-interest loans. Liang Ke's family has five members, all living a "rich peasant landlord-like life." The Party organization of Sha? Cooperative is relatively strong, but recently it was also discovered that one Party member felt "unfree" here and was preparing to go to Nanyang as an overseas worker…. Similar examples can be cited a lot. What is serious is that until today, we have not found a single Category Three cooperative that has risen to become a Category One cooperative. On the contrary, in this year, the transformation of Category One cooperatives into Category Three cooperatives has been common. All of this shows that it is necessary to draw a clear line between capitalism and socialism among the broad masses of peasants, and the Socialist Education Movement must be fully rolled out and implemented to the end. Category Three cooperatives must be carried out, and Category One cooperatives must also be carried out without exception. As for the difficulties of insufficient manpower and insufficient time, they can be completely overcome, and many places have set an example. When arranging this work, the Shaoguan Prefectural Committee decided to "sit on the cooperatives that have already been rolled out and keep an eye on the cooperatives that are about to be rolled out." Some counties and districts in Foshan are preparing to select deputy secretaries and deputy township heads from the existing district and township cadres to lead the cooperatives that are about to be rolled out, while the secretaries and township heads insist on the cooperatives that have already been rolled out. The experiences of other places also show that as long as there is determination, there are ways to overcome the specific difficulties in the movement.
　　Let us repeat a sentence: The Socialist Education Movement is a national movement. Whether it is a Category One cooperative or a Category Three cooperative, this stage must never be skipped.

　　不能跳过这一关

    广东农村的社会主义教育运动，已先后铺开了两批，扩展到近两万个社，占全省农业社的40％。剩下的60％，不久也要展开社会主义教育运动。运动主要集中在二类社和三类社，二者合计约占70％。的确，二类和三类社的问题最多，受资本主义思想影响也最深，集中力量先把这批社整好，是完全正确的。但是现在，却有人提出只整落后社，不整一类社的意见。他们说，一类社“问题不大”，领导这一运动的干部少，忙不过来；同时，秋收将届，时间也调配不开等等。中共广东省委最近一次会议上，就具体批判了这种论调。认为这不光是对社会主义教育运动的意义认识不足，而且说明直到今天，还有一部分同志对近年来农村资本主义思想抬头的严重情况估计不足。
    广东农村的合作化运动，已经取得了决定性的胜利，绝大多数农业社都办得很好，这个事实谁都抹煞不了。但是近一年来，由于放松了政治思想工作，农村资本主义倾向有了明显的发展，而且在很大程度上威胁着合作社的巩固。大鸣大放中所暴露的问题，就更说明了这一情况的严重性。但直到今天，还找不出一类社并不受资本主义思想影响、因而并不需要进行社会主义教育运动的根据。相反的，却有大量事实说明不能跳过这一关。让我们随便举些例子来看吧！
    韶关专区的白土乡，原是曲江县的三等模范社，在转向高级化的第一年，他们遇上了几十年来所没有的奇害大旱，在党支部的领导下，人们战胜了灾害，主粮没有减产，副业增加了收入。经历了自然灾害考验的农业社，照理说应该没有问题或者“问题不大了”吧？但由于近年来放松了政治工作，资本主义思想则乘隙而起，仅仅一年的时间，就把个模范社摧残到“崩溃的边缘”。汕头专区的后吉社，合作化初期也是惠来县的一类社，他们曾使稻谷产量一年增涨40.9％。社员口粮由二百九十斤，一下提高到三百八十斤。但在几个资本主义思想严重的富裕中农的策动下，几天功夫就把个合作社闹散了伙。今年春天，后吉社一个劳动日，竟低到只有四分八厘钱。散社不到一月，就有十二户贫农和下中农出卖青苗和低价出让土地，还有若干人以八分高利去贷款。合作化初期的蓬勃朝气，一下扫光了。佛山专区的沙?社，从土地改革到今天，都是顺德县的重点乡。因为党员多，干部强，在退社风潮闹得最凶的经济作物区，沙?社没有一户退社。领导机关也一再称赞他们经得起风吹雨打。可是最近一检查，那里有三个队，约八十户农家已经实行了“包产到户”，他们在“自负盈亏”的幌子下，早已成了挂名社员。沙?社里，有一个社员，叫梁克，土改前是“贫农中最穷的穷人”，可是现在，他已拥有九头奶牛，三个牛工，两辆脚踏车，还放出了一大笔高利贷。梁克家里共有五口人，都过起了“富农地主一样的生活”。沙?社的党组织是比较坚强的，但近来也发现有一个党员嫌在这里“不自由”，准备到南洋当侨工……。类似例子，还可举出很多，严重的是：直到今天，我们还没有发现那一个三类社上升成了一类社，相反的，这一年中，一类社变三类社的事，却屡见不鲜。所有这些，都说明必须在广大农民中划清资本主义和社会主义的界限，社会主义教育运动必须全面铺开，贯彻到底。三类社固然要进行，一类社同样要进行，不能例外。至于人力不够和时间不足的困难，完全可以克服，而且不少地方做出了榜样。韶关地委在安排这一工作时，决定把“屁股坐在已经铺开社，眼睛看着将要铺开社”。佛山有些县区，准备从现有区乡干部中，抽出副书记和副乡长去领导将要铺开的社，书记和乡长坚持已经铺开的社。其他地方的经验也说明，只要有决心，就有办法克服运动中的具体困难。
    让我们重复说一句：社会主义教育运动是全民性的运动，不论是一类社还是三类社，都绝不能跳过这一关。
