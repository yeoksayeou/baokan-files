    Mobilizing Social Forces to Run Welfare Undertakings
    Anshan to Raise Funds to Build a Batch of Hotels, Dining Halls, and Theaters
    (Our Dispatch) The Anshan Municipal People's Committee and the Standing Committee of the Anshan Municipal Political Consultative Conference have decided to mobilize social forces to assist the government in running public welfare undertakings. According to this decision, the "Anshan City Welfare Undertakings Fundraising Committee" was established on October 5th. This committee is responsible for raising 500,000 to 800,000 yuan to build a batch of public welfare enterprises such as hotels, dining halls, theaters, and cinemas throughout the city.
    In recent years, with the care of the state, Anshan City's public utilities and welfare facilities have greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics, the city currently has four cinemas, three theaters, more than ninety clubs, more than one hundred and ninety bathhouses, more than thirty hotels and guesthouses, more than three hundred and fifty dining halls, and more than one hundred and ninety nurseries and kindergartens. Despite this, the social welfare facilities invested in by the state still cannot keep up with the growing needs of the people's lives. The Anshan Municipal People's Committee and the Standing Committee of the Anshan Municipal Political Consultative Conference held a joint meeting to study these situations. The meeting believed that to solve this problem, it is impossible to endlessly ask the state for money. We should adopt a method of facing the masses and relying on the masses, and absorb the masses' own financial resources to run a part of the social welfare undertakings. This can not only reduce the burden on the state, but also improve people's lives, and at the same time cultivate the masses' habit of saving.
    The funds for these social welfare undertakings will be officially raised starting from November. Industrialists, business people, engineers, technicians and other qualified workers will voluntarily subscribe for shares. A portion of the welfare funds and public welfare funds from various enterprises (including joint state-private enterprises and cooperative-run enterprises) will also be drawn as collective shares. The shares are divided into six denominations: one, two, five, ten, fifty, and one hundred yuan. The principal will be repaid in five installments over five years, and appropriate interest will be given according to the profit situation of the welfare undertaking. The issuance, repayment of principal, and payment of interest of the shares will be uniformly entrusted to the People's Bank and its affiliated institutions. Shares can be transferred, and shareholders can also get a refund of their shares if they are transferred away from the area.

    动员社会力量　举办福利事业
    鞍山将集资兴建一批旅馆食堂和剧院
    本报讯　鞍山市人民委员会和鞍山市政协常委会决定动员社会力量，协助政府举办社会公共福利事业。根据这个决定，“鞍山市福利事业集资委员会”在10月5日成立了。这个委员会负责集资五十到八十万元，在全市修建一批旅馆、食堂、剧院和电影院等公共福利企业。
    鞍山市的公用事业和福利设施，几年来在国家的关怀下有了很大的发展。据不完全统计，目前全市已有电影院四座，剧场三处，俱乐部九十多个，浴池一百九十多所，旅店和招待所三十多处，食堂三百五十多个，托儿所、幼儿园一百九十多所。尽管如此，由国家投资兴办的社会福利设施，仍然赶不上人民群众日益增长的生活需要。鞍山市人民委员会和鞍山市政协常委会曾召开联席会议研究了这些情况。会议认为：要解决这个问题，不能无限制地伸手向国家要钱，应该采取面向群众、依靠群众的办法，吸收群众自己的资金力量来举办一部分社会福利事业。这样既能减轻国家负担，又能改善人民生活，同时可以培养群众节约储蓄的习惯。
    这些社会福利事业的资金，将从11月份起正式开始募集，由工商业者、工程技术人员和其他有条件的职工群众等自愿认股，还要从各企业单位（包括公私合营和合作社营）的福利基金和公益金中抽出一部分作为集体股。股金分一、二、五、十、五十、一百元六种票额。本金在五年内分五次偿还，并将按福利事业的盈余情况给以适当利息。股金的发行、还本和付息工作，统一委托人民银行及其所属机构办理。股票可以转让，股主如果调离当地，还可以退还股金。
