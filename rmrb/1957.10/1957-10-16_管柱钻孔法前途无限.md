　　The Future of Caisson Foundation Method Is Limitless
　　Special Correspondent Xu Chi

    The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which is being celebrated for its completion and opening to traffic, is a magnificent, beautiful, and socialist building.

    From the perspective of its appearance: the bridge is an indescribably beautiful bridge.
    In terms of quality, it is a first-rate, excellent bridge. In terms of technology, it is a bridge with world-leading technology.
    Everyone strolling near the Wuchang bridgehead can now see a "Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Completion Memorial Stele" erected at the location equivalent to the former Yellow Crane Tower. This is a stele as high as 11.55 meters. The marble base of the stele is octagonal. The circular body of the stele symbolizes the large caissons that serve as the bridge's foundation. The box-shaped top symbolizes a miraculously skillful socialist technological tool—the vibratory pile driver.

    Now, people passing over the bridge can no longer see those large caissons. They are all under the deep water, on top of the bedrock. They are inserted into the bedrock, taking root in the bedrock. On top of every twenty or thirty caissons rests a bridge pier.

    The new technology of bridge construction was pioneered on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.

    On the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the new foundation structure unprecedented in the history of world bridges—the large caisson foundation—and the new construction method—the caisson drilling method—were successfully created for the first time.

    Now, when our engineering and technical personnel walk on top of the bridge, they are truly walking on top of world bridge engineering technology.

    Before the birth of this new thing, some in the technical community had doubts and objections. At that time, a sharp struggle between the advanced and the backward occurred. Now, after rigorous technical appraisal, it has been proven that the use of large caisson foundations and the caisson drilling method on the bridge is the most reasonable, of great significance, and a great innovation.

    Now, more than just this one bridge has adopted this new method.

    The Minjiang River Bridge near Yibin, after adopting the large caisson drilling method, rapidly completed its foundation engineering in just eight months.

    Now, the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has undertaken the construction of twelve bridges distributed across seven provinces. Among them, all large bridges have adopted the large caisson drilling method.

    The builders of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have skillfully mastered these technologies: using vibratory pile drivers to sink caissons, using large drilling machines to excavate the bedrock, and then performing underwater concrete pouring...

    And the caisson drilling method itself has also moved forward.

    Under the bridge piers of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, large caissons with a diameter of 1.55 meters were used. However, as early as last year, the Engineering Bureau tested larger caissons with a diameter of 3 meters, and later tested caissons with a diameter of 5 meters.

    Now, on the construction site of the Zhanghe River Bridge, large caissons with a diameter of 3.6 meters are being used for construction. Two caissons can support a double-track bridge pier.

    And the mighty vibratory pile driver has also developed from the initial APE-1 model with 17 tons of power to the APE-3 model with 44 tons of power, and then to the APE-4 model with 97 tons of power. These were all used on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Now, due to the appearance of caissons with diameters of 3 to 5 meters, corresponding APE-5 and APE-6 models with even greater power vibratory pile drivers have appeared. Let's not talk about other equipment here.

    The future of the caisson drilling method is limitless.

    It can not only be used for bridge construction, but also for building the foundations of factory buildings. It can easily and quickly sink caissons as needed and pour them into solid factory foundations. It does not require excavation, support, or backfilling.

    The caisson drilling method can also be used to build coal mine shafts, no matter how deep they are. It can greatly shorten the construction time of shafts and reduce costs.

    The caisson drilling method can also be used for building foundation engineering with heavy loads, such as the foundation engineering of large blast furnaces.

    As for underwater construction, its advantages are even more obvious. It solves the difficulties of deep-water construction that pneumatic caissons cannot solve. This has not only been proven on the Yangtze River Bridge but also in the underwater engineering of a certain deep-water pump contracted by the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau.

    The caisson drilling method can also be used to build hydraulic hubs. Although no hydraulic hub has adopted it so far, we have at least seen a design schematic diagram jointly designed by Chinese and Soviet engineers for building cofferdams for dams using this method. It can ensure the completion of the cofferdam project, regardless of how large the construction flow of the river is.

    The future of the caisson drilling method is unlimited. Chinese and Soviet scientists have already talked about that it can also be used in harbor engineering.

    A brand-new technical science has been born. The Yangtze River Bridge is its cradle. It has already been promoted in the Soviet Union. It has become a research project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and many engineering and technical scientific research institutions.

    While celebrating the completion and opening of the Yangtze River Bridge, let us also cheer for the birth of the large caisson foundation and the caisson drilling method and its unlimited development.

    Needless to say, it is a joint creation of Chinese and Soviet scientists. This is a brilliant example of international technological cooperation. Needless to say, this brings tremendous practical encouragement to the central government's instructions to catch up with the world's advanced technological level.

    Look, the Yangtze River Bridge, with red flags planted all over it, is about to be cut and opened to traffic. The sound of the wheels and whistles of trains running north-south from afar is coming. Closer and closer, closer and closer. Cheer, cheer, cheer!

　　管柱钻孔法前途无限
　　本报特约记者　徐迟
    正在庆祝落成通车的武汉长江大桥是一座雄伟的、美丽的、社会主义的建筑物。
    从外形上看是这样的：大桥是不可言喻的美丽的桥。
    从质量上说，它是头等的优良的桥。从技术上说，它是世界先进技术的桥。
    每一个在武昌桥头堡旁边散步的人，如今都可以看到，在相当于从前的黄鹤楼的位置上，矗立着一座“长江大桥落成纪念碑”。这是一座高达十一点五五公尺的碑。大理石的碑座是八角形的。圆形的碑身象征着作为大桥基础的大型管柱。碑顶箱形，象征着一件神乎其技的社会主义技术的机具——震动打桩机。
    如今通过大桥的人，再看不见那些个大型管柱了。它们都在深水之下，岩盘之上。它们插入岩盘，在岩盘上扎下根，每二十来根、三十来根管柱上面，顶着一座桥墩。
    在长江大桥上，创始了这个桥梁建筑的新技术。
    在长江大桥上，第一次胜利地创造了世界桥梁史上尚无先例的新的基础结构——大                             型管柱基础，创造了新的施工方法——管柱钻孔法。
    如今，当我们的工程技术人员走在大桥顶上时，他们是名副其实地走在世界桥梁工程技术的顶上。
    在这个新事物诞生之前，技术界曾有人怀疑过，反对过。当时发生了先进对落后的尖锐斗争。而现在，经过严格的技术鉴定，证明了大型管柱基础和管柱钻孔法在大桥上采用是最为合理的，是意义重大的，是一个伟大的革新。
    现在，更不止这一座大桥采用了这个新的方法。
    宜宾附近的岷江大桥，在采用了大型管柱钻孔法后，只用了八个月的时间，就迅速地完成了它的基础工程。
    现在，铁道部武汉大桥工程局承担了分布于七省的十二座桥梁的修建工程。其中，凡属大型的桥梁都采用了大型管柱钻孔法。
    长江大桥的建设家们已经熟练地掌握了这些个技术：用震动打桩机使管柱下沉，用大型钻探机挖开岩盘，然后进行水下混凝土浇灌……。
    而管柱钻孔法自身也向前发展了。
    在长江大桥的桥墩下面，用的是直径一点五五公尺的大型管柱。但是，工程局早在去年就试验了更大的，直径达三公尺的管柱，后来又试验了直径五公尺的管柱。
    现在，在漳河大桥的工地上，正在用三点六公尺的直径的大型管柱施工。两条管柱，就能顶住一座复线桥墩。
    而那威武的震动打桩机，也从最初阿波—1型的十七吨威力发展到阿波—3型的四十四吨威力，再发展到阿波—4型的九十七吨威力。这些在长江大桥上都使用了。现在，由于直径三至五公尺的管柱出现了，相应的出现了阿波—5和阿波—6型的威力更大的震动打桩机。别的其他的机具，在这里就不说了吧。
    管柱钻孔法是前途无限的。
    它不仅可以用于建桥，还可以用来建筑工厂厂房的基础。它可以容易地、迅疾地按照需要，下沉管柱，浇灌成为结实的厂房基础。它无须挖坑、支撑、回填。
    管柱钻孔法还可以用来建设煤矿竖井，无论它有多末深。它可以大大缩短竖井的建设时间，降低造价。
    管柱钻孔法又可以用于建筑负载重荷的基础工程，例如大高炉的基础工程。
    至于在深水之下，它的优越性当然更是明显。它解决了气压沉箱所不能解决的深水施工困难。这不仅在长江大桥上已经证明，并且在武汉大桥工程局承包的某一深水水泵的水下工程中，也证明了。
    管柱钻孔法还可以用来建设水力枢纽。虽然迄今还没有一座水力枢纽采用它，可是我们至少已经看到了一个由中苏工程师共同设计的采用这方法建筑拦河大坝的围堰的设计示意图。它可以确保围堰工程的建成，不怕那河流的施工流量有多大。
    管柱钻孔法的前途是无可限量的。中苏科学家已经谈到，在海港工程上，也可以采用它。
   一门崭新的技术科学已经诞生了。长江大桥是它的摇篮。它已经在苏联推行。它已经成为中国科学院和许多工程技术科学研究机构的一个研究项目。
    在庆祝长江大桥落成通车的时候，也让我们欢呼大型管柱基础和管柱钻孔法的诞生和它的无可限量的发展。
    自不待言，它是中苏两国科学家的共同创造。这是国际技术合作的光辉的创造的范例。自不待言，这为中央指示的赶上世界先进技术水平带来了莫大的现实的鼓舞作用。
    看啊，红旗插满了的长江大桥，即将剪彩通车了。远远传来了从远方开来的纵贯南北的火车的车轮声、汽笛声。越来越近，越来越近。欢呼吧，欢呼吧，欢呼吧！
