Prevention and Care of Respiratory Infections in Children
Hu Yamei, Attending Physician, Beijing Children's Hospital

A child's illness is closely related to the climate and season. Respiratory infections are more likely to occur in cold weather, and this year they arrived early in Beijing. Most of the children who come to the Children's Hospital for treatment these days have this type of illness. According to statistics from medical institutions across the country, these illnesses have always ranked first in the incidence of all pediatric diseases. Although there has been significant progress in the treatment of these illnesses in recent years, they still seriously threaten the health and lives of young children. Therefore, I would like to discuss the common knowledge of the care and prevention of these illnesses here, hoping to attract the attention of parents and childcare workers.

The respiratory tract is divided into two parts: the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, pharynx, and trachea; and the lower respiratory tract, which includes the bronchi and lung tissue.

Common colds, flu, and tonsillitis are collectively referred to as upper respiratory tract infections. Most children with these diseases only have a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and a slight cough. Children who can speak can also express discomfort in their throats. More severe symptoms include abdominal pain or diarrhea, and a slightly elevated body temperature around 38 degrees Celsius. For this mild infection, as long as the child rests well, is given easily digestible food and plenty of water, the symptoms will mostly disappear or lessen within two or three days. Some children experience a sudden and severe onset of these diseases, with a sudden high fever up to 40 degrees Celsius, even convulsions, or severe abdominal pain. At this time, a towel soaked in cold water should be applied to the sick child's forehead, and they should be taken to a nearby clinic for examination. Some medicines such as aspirin or APC can be prepared at home. If there is no time to find a doctor, aspirin can be taken first to lower the body temperature, and the convulsions will stop as well. However, do not abuse over-the-counter drugs, because many infectious diseases also have fever in their early stages. Taking antipyretics will temporarily lower the body temperature, which will delay the early diagnosis of infectious diseases.

In children with poor nutritional status, or who have not received good care after contracting these diseases, the infection can spread downwards and become bronchitis. There is often a dry cough at this time. If the larynx is also inflamed at the same time, there will be hoarseness, wheezing, and a barking cough. At this time, in addition to the above treatment, the indoor temperature must be kept at around 21 degrees Celsius, and the humidity of the air should be increased (a large pot of boiling water can be boiled on the stove, or water can be sprinkled on the ground to moisten the mucous membrane of the sick child's respiratory tract with steam). At the same time, a doctor should use anti-inflammatory tablets or antibiotics such as penicillin.

If the infection spreads further downwards, it will develop into bronchiolitis and pneumonia, which are lower respiratory tract infections. Now, let's just talk about pneumonia.

In addition to spreading from upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia often follows pertussis, measles, and influenza. We have statistically found that 90% of children with pneumonia are under three years old, especially those with poor nutritional status. This is because the pathogens of pneumonia often parasitize in the noses and throats of adults and healthy children; and young children generally have less outdoor activity in cold weather, and most families do not have the habit of opening windows every day. Due to poor air circulation or overcrowded living spaces, small, weak children are more likely to become infected.

The initial symptoms of pneumonia are a sudden fever (often with a mild cold before the onset), and often accompanied by coughing, difficulty breathing, and nasal flaring. These symptoms are more obvious the younger the child is. However, newborns and malnourished children have a slower onset, sometimes without fever or cough, so it is not easy to detect early. Infants generally also have diarrhea and vomiting after getting sick, and do not want to eat; severe cases quickly develop rapid breathing, cyanosis around the lips, systemic exhaustion, coma, or convulsions.

If you have pneumonia, you should seek treatment from a doctor and need good care: the sick child must have sufficient rest to increase their natural resistance; when the sick child has a high fever, they usually do not want to eat, so they can eat some milk, soy milk, thin porridge, noodles, egg custard, etc. in small amounts and frequently. At the same time, drink plenty of water, preferably more fresh fruits, such as oranges, apples, etc.; the sick child should breathe fresh air, so the room should be opened frequently to allow air circulation, or the sick child should be wrapped in a cotton quilt or sleeping bag, leaving only the eyes, nose, and mouth outside, and placed outdoors, starting with twice a day for half an hour each time, and then gradually extending the time, generally one to two hours each time. Generally, the sick child will quickly breathe steadily, fall asleep quietly after going outdoors.

How to prevent colds and pneumonia?

First, pay attention to the child's nutrition and physical exercise. Here, I want to specifically mention outdoor sleep. This is a good way to exercise a child's body using air. It can improve the child's body's resistance to various infectious diseases. The experimental nursery of the Beijing Maternal and Child Health Institute has long adopted this method, proving that during the flu season, children who adopt the outdoor sleep method get half as many colds as ordinary children, or even none at all.

Second, children's houses should be opened frequently to allow air circulation. Because sudden changes in climate and room temperature are often the cause of respiratory infections, the temperature in the room should not be too high, but drafts (the so-called through-the-hall wind) should be avoided. You shouldn't wear too much in the house, and you should add clothes when you go outdoors to maintain a constant temperature.

Third, in winter, do not take young children to crowded public places, such as cinemas, department stores, etc. Because there are many people in these places, the air is bad, and many adults have pneumococcus in their throats, which can easily infect children.

Fourth, adults or older children who have a cold should be isolated from young children as much as possible. If a breastfeeding mother has a cold, she must wear a mask and wash her hands with soap before touching the child.

Fifth, try to prevent infectious diseases, because children are prone to secondary pneumonia after getting infectious diseases. Nowadays, large cities generally give children injections for pertussis and diphtheria prevention. This is a very effective method. Anyone who has not been vaccinated should go for vaccination. In collective children's institutions, upper respiratory tract infections should be isolated like infectious diseases to prevent them from spreading.

    预防和护理孩子的呼吸道感染病北京
    儿童医院主治医师　胡亚美
    孩子得病跟气候、季节很有关系。冷天好发生呼吸道感染，今年提早来到了北京。最近上儿童医院看病的孩子，大多是这类病。本来，根据全国各地医疗机构的统计，以往所有小儿疾病发病率中，这类病就占第一位。近年来虽然在这类病的治疗上已有很大的进展，但是它仍严重地威胁着小孩子的健康和生命。因此，这里特地来谈谈这类病的护理和预防的常识，希望引起父母和儿童工作者的重视。
    呼吸道分为两部分：上呼吸道，包括鼻子、咽喉和气管；下呼吸道，就是枝气管和肺组织。
    一般的伤风、感冒和扁桃体炎，统称为上呼吸道感染。得了这些疾病的孩子，大多数只是流鼻涕、鼻子不通气、打喷嚏、稍稍有点咳嗽，会说话的孩子能表示嗓子也不舒服；稍重的还有肚子痛或拉稀、体温稍高到摄氏三十八度左右。对这种轻度的感染，只要让孩子好好休息，给孩子容易消化的饮食和足量的水份，症状大多数在两三天内就会消失或减轻。有些孩子患这类病时来势较猛，会突然发高烧到摄氏四十度，甚至发生抽风，或有剧烈的肚子痛。这时，应该立刻把浸过冷水的毛巾敷在病孩前额部，同时到附近诊所去检查。家里可以准备一些阿斯匹林或A·P·C之类的药品，如果来不及找医生，可以先服阿斯匹林，使体温下降，抽风也会随着停止。但是，千万不要滥用成药，因为有许多传染病的早期也有发烧，吃了退热药，体温暂时下降，反而会耽误传染病的早期诊断。
    在营养状况差的，或是得了这类病后没经过很好照护的孩子身上，这种感染会向下蔓延而成气管炎。这时常有干咳。如果同时喉头也发炎，就会声音嘶哑、喘和哮咳（像犬吠）。这时候，除上述治疗外，一定要使室内的温度保持在摄氏二十一度左右，并使空气湿度加高（可在火炉上煮一大盆开水，或在地上洒水，利用蒸气润湿病儿呼吸道的粘膜）。同时，由医师来使用消炎片或盘尼西林等抗生素疗法。
    要是感染再向下蔓延，就会发生枝气管炎和肺炎，也就是下呼吸道感染。现在只谈谈肺炎。
    肺炎除由上呼吸道感染蔓延而来以外，也常常续发在百日咳、麻疹、流行性感冒以后。我们曾统计过，得肺炎的孩子90％在三岁以下，尤以营养状况差的孩子为多。这是因为肺炎的病原菌常常寄生在成人和健康孩子的鼻子和咽喉中；而一般小孩子冷天户外活动少，一般家庭没有每天开窗户的习惯，由于空气不流通，或居室过于拥挤，小的、弱的孩子就容易得到感染。
    肺炎的最初症状就是突然发烧（发作前常有轻度的伤风），并且常常伴有咳嗽、呼吸困难、鼻翼煽动。这些症状，年龄越小的孩子就越明显。但新生婴儿和营养不良的孩子起病比较迟缓，有时不发烧，或没有咳嗽，所以不容易早期发现。一般婴儿得病后还常有拉稀和呕吐现象，不想吃东西；重的很快发生呼吸急促，口唇周围青紫，全身衰竭，昏迷或抽风。
    得了肺炎应该找医师治疗，并需很好地护理：必须让病孩有充分的休息，以增加他的自然抵抗力；病孩在高烧的时候，大多不想吃东西，可以让他少量多次地吃些牛奶、豆浆、稀粥、挂面、蛋羹等食物，同时要多喝水，最好多吃新鲜水果，如桔子、苹果等等；应使病孩呼吸新鲜空气，因此居室应该常开窗户，或把病孩用棉被或睡袋包好，只留眼、鼻、口在外边，放在户外，开始时每天放两次，每次半小时，以后逐渐延长时间，大体每次一小时到两小时，一般病孩到户外后就会很快地呼吸平稳、安静入睡。
    怎样预防感冒和肺炎呢？
    第一，注意小孩的营养和体格的锻炼。这里要专门提一提户外睡眠，这是利用空气来锻炼孩子身体的好方法，它可以提高孩子身体对各种传染病的抵抗力。北京市妇幼保健实验院的实验托儿所早已采用这种方法，证明在感冒流行的时期，凡是采用了户外睡眠法的孩子，得感冒的要比一般孩子少一半，甚至根本不得。
    第二，孩子住屋要经常开窗子，使空气流通。因为气候与室温的骤变，常是吸呼道感染的诱因，因此屋里的温度不要过高，但应该避免对流的空气（就是所谓穿堂风）。在屋子里不应该穿得过多，到户外的时候要加上衣服，保持温度的恒定。
    第三，在冬季，不要带年幼的孩子到拥挤的公共场所去，如电影院、百货公司等。这些地方因为人多，空气不好，而且有很多成年人的咽喉中带有肺炎球菌，很容易使小孩感染。
    第四，成人或较大的儿童得了感冒以后，要尽量与幼儿隔离。喂奶的母亲如果得了感冒，一定要带好口罩，把手用肥皂洗净以后再接触孩子。
    第五，尽量预防传染病，因为得传染病以后孩子很容易续发肺炎。现在大城市普遍地给孩子注射百日咳、白喉预防针，这是非常有效的办法，凡是没有注射过的都应该去注射。在集体儿童机构里应该把上呼吸道感染当作传染病一样地隔离起来，以免流行开来。
