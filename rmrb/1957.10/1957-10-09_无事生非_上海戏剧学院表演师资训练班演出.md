    “Much Ado About Nothing”
    ——Performance by the Shanghai Theatre Academy Performance Teachers Training Class

    Comrade Lepkovskaya's direction of "Much Ado About Nothing" has finally met with the Beijing audience. Last autumn, I heard that she had selected Shakespeare's comedy as a subject for performance training. I felt that she was taking quite a risk, because this is one of Shakespeare's most difficult comedies to please. But after seeing the performance of her and her students today, although the students still lack some of the brilliance of creating character images, I found my worries were superfluous. As the saying goes, "Nothing is impossible to a willing heart." Her success all the more deepened my admiration for her artistic achievements and the excellent tradition of Soviet Shakespearean drama performances. I vividly learned a lesson with profound meaning.
    The first impression that Shakespeare's comedies give us is that the playwright loves life. A person with a melancholy heart will forever stand outside Shakespeare's comedic world and fail to appreciate the sunshine-filled life. Even when writing about the most pessimistic people, Shakespeare's writing is still glittering. The melancholy Jaques in "As You Like It" can be said to be quite unemotional about life, saying that "All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players," unexpectedly he is one of the actors, and his philosophy becomes our laughing stock. Shakespeare is not afraid of the hustle and bustle; his imagined world is colorful and vibrant. A story from a book, once in his hands, becomes vivid and alive because he injects life into it. "Much Ado About Nothing" is the best illustration.
    As a dramatic artist, Shakespeare's second characteristic, in my opinion, is to highlight the character of the main characters, which complements and enhances the plot, and the plot further serves these distinctive characters. Even the comedic wit and humor are often byproducts of these distinctive characters. The story of "Much Ado About Nothing" comes from a collection of Italian stories. Claudio and Hero's marriage is the main plot of the story. However, what Shakespeare painstakingly weaves into this already dramatic story is his unique understanding of people and life. He created the pair of bickering but wonderful lovers, Benedick and Beatrice. (We will also never forget his remarkable constable Dogberry.) They only quarrel with each other, but under the teasing of friends and relatives, they unexpectedly fall deeply in love. After falling in love, they still remain stubborn, saying that they only pity each other. The contradiction and unity of character persist throughout the play. With lively plots and prominent characters, even if these plot-driven comedies (like "The Taming of the Shrew") are called character comedies, I think it makes sense.
    I only mention these two points here because Comrade Lepkovskaya gave me great inspiration in this regard. She found the guiding ideology of the whole play, and also excavated concrete images from life, in line with Shakespeare's dramatic requirements. She also created the atmosphere, but she does not emphasize the scenery. She uses people and their actions to create a more fascinating and lively atmosphere. Because after all, if we are intoxicated by the beautiful scenery, we also love human activities more. Listen to the laughter of the girls at the beginning of the play. Look at the victorious soldiers leaping on the high slope. And the manor town restricts the audience's vision. Only the bright sky of Sicily remains. Only the conquering Spaniards live under it.
    She further created all the members of this family, not just the few names countable on the character list. She created a crowd that reflects the mood of the main characters and the dramatic situation. She made such vivid use of the second act's scene in front. The Elizabethan stage and acting troupe could not realize Shakespeare's dramatic ideal. Today it can be realized. Lively plot, lively people. Joy is overflowing in and out of the play. Vulgar directors, using scientific achievements, can easily reduce the poetic quality of Shakespeare's language. Comrade Lepkovskaya, on the contrary, gives the appropriate and prominent position to the characters who need to be prominent and must be appropriate.
    She also felt that she was not bold enough (as the saying goes: great skill emboldens the artist), and adjusted the original scenes of the script. We see that she did this in order to complete the circular completion of the main line of action. She simply cancelled the prison scene. Because she must have found that its gloomy scene hinders the joyful atmosphere of the whole script (after her adjustment).
    This is a masterpiece. Written with great ease. The governor asks the band in the audience to play music. The constables walk from the audience onto the stage. The play is next to the audience, but it is harmonious everywhere. A friend said that her play is completed in one breath. And this complete feeling of being completed in one breath is also due to her skillful handling and accurate use of details. Her work helped her successfully complete her interpretation of the script.

    “无事生非”
    ——上海戏剧学院表演师资训练班演出
    李健吾
    列普科芙斯卡娅同志导演的“无事生非”，终于和北京观众见面了。去年秋天，听说她选定莎士比亚这出喜剧，作为表演训练的课题。我觉得她相当冒险，因为这是莎翁顶难讨好的一出喜剧。但是今天看过她和她的学生的演出，尽管学生还缺乏一些创造人物形象的光彩，我发现我的耽心成了多余。正所谓“天下无难事，只怕有心人”，她的成功分外增深我对她的艺术造诣以及苏联莎士比亚戏剧演出的优良传统的钦佩。我活生生上了意味隽永的一课。
    莎士比亚的喜剧，给我们的第一个印象，就是剧作者热爱生活。一个心地落寞的人，永远站在莎翁喜剧世界之外，领略不了阳光普照的人生。即使写的是最悲观的人，莎翁的笔墨也是金光闪闪。“如愿”的杰克，对生活可以说是够没有感情的了，说什么“世界是舞台，男男女女，个个只是演员”，不料自己便是演员中间的一个，他的哲学成了我们的笑料。莎翁不怕热火朝天，他的想像世界是众相缤纷，有声有色。一个书本上的故事，到了他手上，由于他注射生命进去，就栩栩如生，活了起来。“无事生非”即是最好的说明。
    作为戏剧艺术家，莎翁的第二个特征，在我看来，就是突出主要人物的性格，和情节相成相长，而情节又进一步为这些有特色的性格效劳。甚至于喜剧的诙谐感、幽默感，往往也是这些有特色的性格的副产品。“无事生非”的故事来自一本意大利故事集。克劳第和喜罗的婚事是故事的主要情节。可是莎翁在这戏剧性已经浓厚的故事上用心织绘的，却是他对人物和生活独特领会出来的东西。他创造了白尼迪和佩特丽丝这对冤家妙人。（我们也永远忘不了他的绝人巡官。）他们在一起，从来只有斗口，然而在亲友捉狭之下，居然深深相爱了。相爱了，却还嘴硬，说只为了可怜对方。性格上的矛盾和统一在戏里始终持续着。情节热闹，性格显目，这类情节喜剧（还有“驯悍记”）即使叫做性格喜剧，我看也有道理。
    我这里仅仅说起这两点来，因为列普科芙斯卡娅同志在这方面，给了我很大的启发。她找出全剧的主导思想，同样从生活里发掘具体形象，配合莎翁的戏剧要求。同样制造气氛，她不强调风景环境。她用人和人的行动制造更为引人入胜的活泼气氛。因为话说回来，我们如果沉醉于优美的风景，却也更爱人类自己的活动。听听幕开时姑娘们的笑声吧。看看凯旋的战士们在高坡上奔跃的姿态吧。而庄园的小城限制住了观众的视野。只有西西里的明丽的天空。只有活在它底下的征服者西班牙人。
    她进一步创造了这个家族的全部成员，不光是人物表上可数的几个姓名。她创造了反映主要人物心境和戏剧形势的群众。她把二道幕前用的那样生动。伊利莎白时代的舞台和班底，实现不了莎翁的戏剧理想。今天可以实现了。热闹的情节，热闹的人。欢乐洋溢在戏里戏外。庸俗的导演，利用科学成就，容易减低莎翁的语言的诗意。列普科芙斯卡娅同志相反，把合适而又突出的地位给了她的地位需要突出而又必须合适的人物。
    她还嫌自己不够胆大（常言道：艺高人胆大），又把剧本原有的场面进行了调整。我们看出她这样做，是为了完成行动主线的圆湊。她又干脆取消了监狱那场戏。因为她一定发现它的阴沉景象妨害整个剧本（经她调整之后）的欢乐气息。
    这是大手笔。信笔所之。总督叫台下乐队奏乐。巡丁从剧场走上舞台。戏在观众旁边，然而处处谐和。一位朋友说，她这戏是一气呵成。而这一气呵成的完整感觉，也正由于她对细节的巧妙处理和准确使用。她的工作帮她胜利地完成了她对剧本的解释。
