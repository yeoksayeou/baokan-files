On the Anti-Rightist Front

    Ugly Ji Rui's Conspiracy Smashed
    The staff of the Changsha Daily held more than ten large and small reasoning and struggle meetings in succession, thoroughly smashing the shameful conspiracy of Ugly Ji Rui (pen name Jin Dui), a rightist element and former first deputy leader of the news group in the general editorial office of the newspaper, to tamper with the socialist orientation of the Changsha Daily.
    Under the guise of opposing dogmatism and exposing the "dark side," the rightist element Ugly Ji Rui consistently peddled reactionary bourgeois journalistic views. He was extremely opposed to publishing editorials, resolutions, and instructions in the newspaper. All he pursued were vulgar and sensational news and communications that instilled the decadent bourgeois ideology into the masses. The "Talk Heart Pavilion" column he edited was filled with anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks that slandered Party members and attacked Party organizations.
    In order to put his bourgeois journalistic views into practice, he put forward a so-called organizational program, directing the spearhead at the Changsha Municipal Party Committee and opposing the Municipal Party Committee's leadership over the newspaper. He also shamelessly advocated "open archives" and "democratic management of cadres." The dream of this rightist element, who came from a reactionary bureaucratic family, was exposed by all the staff of the Changsha Daily before it could be realized.

    丑纪锐阴谋被粉碎
    长沙日报工作人员连续举行了十多次大小说理斗争会议，彻底粉碎了该报总编室工作人员、原新闻组第一副组长、右派分子丑纪锐（笔名金兑）企图篡改长沙日报社会主义方向的可耻阴谋。
    右派分子丑纪锐以反对教条主义和揭发“阴暗面”为幌子，一贯贩卖反动的资产阶级新闻观点。他极端反对在报纸上刊登社论决议和指示。他所追求的尽是那些庸俗、猎奇的向群众灌输资产阶级腐朽思想的新闻和通讯。在他编辑的“谈心阁”栏内充斥了丑化党员、攻击党组织的反党、反社会主义的言论。
    为了实践他的资产阶级新闻观点，他提出了所谓组织纲领，把矛头指向中共长沙市委，反对市委对报纸的领导。他还无耻地主张“档案要公开”，“干部要民主管理”这个出身于反动的官僚家庭的右派分子的美梦还未实现，便被长沙日报全体工作人员揭露出来了。
