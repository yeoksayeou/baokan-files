　　He Once Fought to Defend the Soviets
　　—An Interview with Chinese Elder Li Guiting, a Veteran of the Soviet Civil War

　　One evening, this reporter interviewed Comrade Li Guiting, a Chinese elder who participated in the Soviet Civil War. He lives on the second floor of a semi-new building on Zhelyabskaya Street in Kyiv. Although he is over sixty years old, he is still very vigorous.

　　Li Guiting is from Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province. In 1916, at the age of twenty-one, he was recruited by Russian capitalists to work as a laborer in Russia. He and thousands of other Chinese workers were driven to the forests of Kalinkovichi (southeast of Minsk) in Belarus to cut down trees. In the autumn of 1917, Li Guiting and a group of Chinese workers, their contracts having expired, were preparing to return home. When the train arrived in Moscow, the Great October Socialist Revolution broke out. He recalled the situation at the time:

　　"As soon as the train arrived in Moscow, a group of armed workers and soldiers came and told us that the enemy was east of Moscow and the train could not go any further. I inquired and found out that the Bolsheviks were making a revolution. When I was cutting wood in the Kalinkovichi forest, I had met a Bolshevik, a Russian named Mikhail, who had organized Chinese workers to strike for higher wages and had been successful. I learned a lot about revolutionary principles from him. When I saw two Chinese people in the armed worker ranks in Moscow, I asked, 'Can Chinese people also participate in the revolution?' My question made everyone laugh. They said, 'The revolution is for the working masses of the whole world, why shouldn't you participate!' So, I joined the Red Army, along with a large group of Chinese people."

　　After Li Guiting joined the Red Army, he changed his name to Mikhail in memory of that Russian Bolshevik. He was assigned to the International Brigade, which included Chinese, Poles, and Czechs. The commander was a Hungarian named Kovrov. The International Brigade was quickly transferred to Ukraine and merged with the famous General Shchors's guerrilla unit to become the First Ukrainian Division. From then on, Li Guiting followed the troops in battles against German interventionists, Denikin's White Army, Petliura's bandits, and anarchist gangs in the north and south of Ukraine and on both banks of the Dnieper River for more than two years.

　　Li Guiting spoke with great emotion when he talked about seeing his Chinese compatriots and comrades die at his feet. He said: 1919 was the most brutal year of the war. In April of that year, a counter-revolutionary riot broke out near Kyiv. I was a machine gunner, guarding a high point. Landlords and rich peasants charged us madly. My ammunition handler was killed, and soon, the bullets ran out. We immediately waved our sabers, jumped out of the trenches, and charged the enemy. The enemy was finally driven back by us. He pointed to the scars on his face and told me that he was injured in a fierce battle with the White Army at the end of 1919.

　　Li Guiting pondered for a moment and said to me, I can't forget the place where I endured hunger and cold and shed blood for the struggle. I developed a very deep affection for it, so I decided to settle down here.

　　Li Guiting worked as a train driver's assistant and was awarded a Medal of Labor. He is now enjoying his happy retirement.

　　Li Guiting is very concerned about the current situation in his motherland. He hopes that the people of his motherland will work hard and build their motherland as beautifully as the Soviet Union.

　　他曾为保卫苏维埃而战
　　——访参加苏联国内战争的中国老人李贵廷
    一天黄昏，记者访问了参加苏联国内战争的中国老人李贵廷同志。他住在基辅日梁斯卡雅大街一所半新房屋的二层楼上。他虽然已经六十多岁了，但是精神仍然很健旺。
    李贵廷是辽宁省辽阳县人，1916年二十一岁时就被俄国资本家招募来俄国作苦工，他和几千名华工被赶到白俄罗斯的卡林科维奇（在明斯克东南）地方森林中去砍伐树木。1917年秋天，李贵廷和一批华工因为合同期满，准备回国，当火车到莫斯科的时候，爆发了伟大的十月社会主义革命，他回忆当时的情况说：
    “火车一到莫斯科，一批带枪的工人士兵就来告诉我们说，莫斯科以东是敌人，火车不能再走了，我一打听，才知道是布尔什维克闹革命。当我在卡林科维奇森林中砍木头时，曾经认识一个布尔什维克、俄国人米哈伊尔，他曾经组织中国工人为提高工资举行过罢工，并且取得了胜利，我从他那里知道了许多革命的道理。当我看到莫斯科带枪的工人队伍中有两个中国人时，就问：“中国人也可以革命吗？”我这一问，把大家都问笑了，他们说：“闹革命是为了全世界的劳苦大众，怎么不可以呢！”于是，我加入了红军，和我一道参加的还有一大批中国人。”
    李贵廷参加红军后，为了纪念那个俄国布尔什维克，他改名为米哈伊尔。他被编入国际团，团里有中国人、波兰人、捷克人。团长是匈牙利人科夫罗夫。国际团很快就调往乌克兰，和有名的绍尔斯将军的游击队合编成为乌克兰第一师。从此，李贵廷就跟着部队先后在乌克兰南北和第聂伯河两岸同德国干涉者、邓尼金白匪军、彼得留拉匪徒、无政府主义者黑帮战斗了两年多。
    李贵廷谈到当时他看着自己的中国同乡和战友在自己的脚边死去的时候，情绪很激动地说：1919年是战争最残酷的一年。那年4月在基辅近郊发生了反革命暴乱。我担任机枪射手，守在一个制高点上，地主富农向我们疯狂地冲锋，我的弹药手牺牲了，很快，子弹也打光了，我们立刻挥舞着马刀跳出战壕向敌人冲去，敌人终于被我们打退了。他指着脸上斑斑的伤痕对我说，这就是1919年年底在又一次同白匪军的激烈战斗中受伤的。
    李贵廷沉思了一会儿对我说，我忘不掉忍饥受冻、为之流血斗争的地方，我和它发生了很深厚的感情，因此，我决定在这里定居了下来。
    李贵廷作过火车司机助手，曾经荣获一枚劳动勋章，现在正在度过他幸福的晚年生活。
    李贵廷很关心祖国的近况，他希望祖国人民奋勇劳动，把祖国建设得像苏联一样的美好。
