Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th. Over the past forty years, the geographical distribution of industrial production in the Soviet Union has undergone fundamental changes. The eastern, northern, and other remote regions of Russia, which were extremely backward in industrial production before the revolution, have now become areas of particularly rapid economic development in the Soviet Union, playing an increasingly important role in the country's life.

Due to the great development of industrial production, the industrial output of the eastern regions of the Soviet Union (including Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River Basin, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia) now exceeds many times the industrial output of the entire Russia before the revolution. It produces more than 40% of the country's electricity, more than half of its coal, steel, and steel products, nearly half of its pig iron, and more than 70% of its oil.

In the South Caucasus republics and some other formerly backward republics and autonomous republics, industrial production has increased by more than ten to forty or fifty times compared to before the revolution. Even in the far north, which was previously considered impossible to develop production, industrial and agricultural production bases have emerged for the first time.

In this way, the Soviet Union has gradually eliminated the "advanced regions" and "backward regions" that were left over from before the revolution, and eliminated the phenomenon of production areas being far from raw material production areas and consumption areas.

Before the October Revolution, more than 75% of Tsarist Russia's industry was concentrated in Moscow, Petrograd, Ivanovo, and Ukraine. In 1913, 73% of the country's pig iron and about 87% of its coal came from the Donbass and Dnieper River regions of Ukraine, and 99.5% of the country's spindles were concentrated in Petrograd and some central provinces that did not produce cotton. Another industrial center was in Baku and the North Caucasus, where the oil industry produced 95% of the country's oil. However, Siberia, the Far East, Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and many parts of northern European Russia, which accounted for the vast majority of the country's territory, were almost blank slates in terms of industrial development.

After the October Revolution, in order to change this extremely unbalanced situation in the distribution of productive forces, the Soviet government paid attention to the industrial development of previously backward areas in the "All-Russian Electrification Plan" formulated in 1920. During the pre-war five-year plan period starting in 1928, the Soviet Union's industrial production areas continued to expand to previously backward areas, especially the eastern regions, where many factories, mines, and power stations were established on a larger scale. During this period, fifty new industrial centers appeared in the Urals and Siberia alone. During the Great Patriotic War, the country's industrial distribution underwent tremendous changes in a short period of time due to the relocation of industrial enterprises from the war-affected western and central old industrial areas to the eastern regions. In the first three years of the war, an average of two factories were completed every day in the eastern regions.

In the post-war five-year plans, the industrial productive forces of the originally economically backward areas were further developed. Of the approximately six thousand industrial enterprises that were rebuilt and newly built during the Soviet Union's Fourth Five-Year Plan, almost half were built in these areas. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the increase in capital construction investment in the eastern regions was much higher than the national average increase. After the start of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the scale of industrial construction in the eastern regions was even larger, and the Soviet Union's five-year investment in this region will account for about half of the country's total investment.

All these measures have enabled the rapid development of industrial production in the regions where industry was extremely backward before the revolution, especially in the eastern regions. In 1940 before the war, the total value of Soviet large-scale industrial production increased by 10.9 times compared to 1913, while the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East increased by 13.5 times; Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Georgia increased by more than 21 to 25 times, and the Kyrgyz and Tajik republics of Central Asia even increased by 159 times and 241 times respectively.

After the war, industrial construction in these areas continued to develop at a high speed. Compared with 1940, the total industrial production of the Soviet Union increased by 3.2 times in 1955, while the Volga River Basin and the Ural region increased by 5.5 times, West Siberia and East Siberia increased by 5.6 times and 3.4 times respectively, and Kazakhstan and Central Asia increased by nearly 3.4 times.

The large-scale industrial construction carried out in the past backward areas has changed the face of the Soviet Union's production geography. Now, in addition to the central and western industrial centers that were originally more developed before the revolution and have been further developed in the Soviet era, new industrial centers have emerged everywhere. The iron and steel industry is no longer only distributed in the Donbass and Dnieper River regions. The Urals and Siberia have long established the Soviet Union's second largest metallurgical industrial base, where the annual output of pig iron and steel is now almost equal to half of the country's output. Now, Siberia is starting to build the Soviet Union's third largest metallurgical industrial base. In addition, strong iron and steel industrial enterprises have also been established in the Volga River Basin, the North Caucasus, Kazakhstan, northern Soviet Union and the Far East regions, and Central Asia.

In terms of fuel production, in addition to the famous Donbass coal region, the Soviet Union also established several large coal mining bases such as Kuzbass, Karaganda, and Pechora in the eastern and northern regions during the five-year plan period, and developed local coal mining industries in the Far East, East Siberia, the Urals, Central Asia, and many other regions. At the same time, the center of gravity of the oil industry has shifted from Baku to the eastern regions. The "Second Baku" established between the Urals and the Volga River Basin has become the Soviet Union's largest oil production center. In addition, Central Asia, the Far East, Georgia, and other places also have oil industries.

The distribution of the most important industrial sector—the machine manufacturing industry—has also changed. At present, almost every region of the Soviet Union has established machine manufacturing industrial enterprises.

In terms of electricity production, before the revolution, Russia's electric power industrial enterprises were almost all concentrated in several large cities such as Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev, but now the distribution network of thermal power plants and hydropower stations covers the whole country. In addition, tremendous changes have also taken place in the distribution of metal processing, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, building materials, wood processing, light industry, and the food industry. Even in the perpetually frozen Arctic region, non-ferrous metal industrial centers such as Norilsk have emerged. With the development of industrial construction, newly built railways, highways, air routes, and inland waterway transportation lines have also extended to the emerging industrial areas, connecting them with all parts of the country.

    过去落后地区成长为新工业中心
    苏联生产地理面貌改观
    新华社莫斯科29日电　四十年来，苏联工业生产的地理配置已经发生了根本的变化。在革命前工业生产十分落后的俄国东部、北部和其他边远地区，目前已经成为苏联经济发展特别迅速的地带，它们在国家生活中起着越来越重要的作用。
    由于工业生产的大发展，现在苏联东部地区（包括西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域、哈萨克、中亚细亚）的工业生产已经超过革命前全俄国的工业产量的好多倍，它生产着全国40％以上的电力，一半以上的煤、钢、钢材，将近一半的生铁和70％以上的石油。
    在南高加索各加盟共和国以及其他一些原先是落后的加盟共和国和自治共和国，工业生产已经比革命前增加了十多倍到四、五十倍以上。甚至在过去被认为根本不可能发展生产的极北地区，也第一次出现了工业和农业生产基地。
    这样，苏联就逐步消除了革命前遗留下来的“先进地区”和“落后地区”的界限，消除了生产地区远离原料产地和消费地区的现象。
    十月革命以前，沙皇俄国的工业75％以上都集中在莫斯科、彼得格勒、伊凡诺沃和乌克兰这几个地方。1913年，全国73％的生铁和约87％的煤来自乌克兰的顿巴斯和第聂伯河沿岸地区，全国99.5％的纱锭都集中在并不出产棉花的彼得格勒和中部一些州。另外一个工业中心在巴库和北高加索，那里的石油工业出产着全国95％的石油。然而，占全国领土绝大部分的西伯利亚、远东地区、哈萨克、中亚细亚和俄国欧洲部分北部的许多地方，却几乎是工业发展的空白点。
    十月革命以后，为了改变这种生产力配置极端不平衡的状况，苏维埃政权还在1920年制定的“全俄电气化计划”中就注意到了过去落后地区的工业发展问题。在从1928年开始的战前五年计划的年代中，苏联工业生产地区不断向原先落后地区、特别是东部地区扩大，这些地区以更大的规模建立了许许多多的工厂、矿山和电力站。在这一时期中，单在乌拉尔和西伯利亚就出现了五十个新的工业中心。在卫国战争期间，由于遭受战争影响的西部和中部老工业区的工业企业向东部地区迁移，全国工业分布情况在短时间内发生了巨大的变化。而在战争的头三年间，东部地区平均每一天就有两个工厂建成。
    在战后五年计划中，原先经济落后的地区的工业生产力又得到了进一步的发展。在苏联第四个五年计划期间改建和新建的大约六千个工业企业中，差不多有一半就建设在这些地区。在第五个五年计划期间，东部地区的基本建设投资的增加额大大高于全国的平均增加额。第六个五年计划开始以后，东部地区的工业建设的规模更大，苏联五年中用在这一地区的基本建设投资将约占全国投资总额的一半。
    所有这些措施使得革命前工业极端落后的地区特别是东部地区的工业生产迅速地发展了。在战前1940年，苏联全部大工业生产总值比1913年增加了十点九倍，而其中，乌拉尔、西伯利亚及远东地区就增加了十三点五倍；哈萨克、亚美尼亚、格鲁吉亚共和国增加了二十一倍到二十五倍以上，中亚细亚的吉尔吉斯和塔吉克共和国甚至分别增加了一百五十九倍和二百四十一倍。
    战后，这些地区的工业建设继续以高速度发展。同1940年比较，1955年全苏联工业生产增加为三点二倍，而其中，伏尔加河流域和乌拉尔地区就增加到五点五倍，西西伯利亚和东西伯利亚分别增加为五点六倍和三点四倍，哈萨克和中亚细亚将近增加为三点四倍。
    在过去落后地区进行的大规模的工业建设，改变了苏联生产地理配置的面貌。现在，除了革命前本来就比较发达、而在苏维埃年代中又进一步发展了的中部和西部工业中心外，各地都出现了新的工业中心。钢铁工业已经不仅分布在顿巴斯和第聂伯河沿岸地区了，乌拉尔和西伯利亚早已建立了全苏联第二个巨大的冶金工业基地，那里每年的生铁和钢产量现在差不多等于全国产量的一半。现在，西伯利亚又在开始建设全苏联第三个大冶金工业基地。此外，在伏尔加河流域、北高加索、哈萨克、苏联北部和远东地区及中亚细亚等地也建立了正在强大的钢铁工业企业。
    在燃料生产方面，除了著名的顿巴斯煤区以外，苏联在五年计划年代中还在东部、北部等地建立了库兹巴斯、卡拉干达、彼乔拉等几个大的采煤基地，并且在远东、东西伯利亚、乌拉尔、中亚细亚和其他许多地区发展了地方采煤工业。同时，石油工业的重心已经从巴库向东部地区转移了，在乌拉尔和伏尔加河流域之间建立的“第二巴库”已经成了苏联最大的采油中心。此外，中亚细亚、远东、格鲁吉亚等地也有了石油工业。
    最重要的工业部门——机器制造工业的分布也改变了，目前苏联几乎没一个地区没有建立起机器制造工业企业。
    在电力生产方面，革命以前，俄国的电力工业企业几乎全都集中在列宁格勒、莫斯科、基辅等几个大城市中，而现在火力发电站和水电站分布网已经包括了全国各地。此外，在金属加工、有色金属、化学、建筑材料、木材加工、轻工业和食品工业的分布上，同样也起了巨大的变化。甚至在长年冰冻的北极地区也出现了像诺里尔斯克这样的有色金属工业中心。随着工业建设的发展，新建的铁路、公路、航空线和内河航运线也伸展到新兴的工业地区，把它们同全国各地联结起来。
