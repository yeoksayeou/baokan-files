Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th: Tokyo police authorities revealed today a case of brothel owners extensively bribing legislators of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to prevent the Diet from passing laws prohibiting prostitution. It is said that this case involves twenty politicians within the Liberal Democratic Party.

The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office today arrested two employees of the "National Venereal Disease Prevention Association," an organization composed of 16,000 brothel owners. Police said that this brothel owner organization bribed some influential "political figures" up to $100,000 when the Diet discussed the "Prostitution Prevention Law" in 1955.

Police said that Liberal Democratic Party legislator Giichi Manabe will be summoned. The electoral district of this legislator contains several centuries-old red-light districts.

The law prohibiting prostitution—the "Prostitution Prevention Law"—has been submitted to the Japanese Diet for deliberation five times, but has never been passed. Last May, under pressure from public opinion, the Japanese Diet finally passed this law. This law has already taken effect this April, but the penalty clauses in the law will not take effect until April next year. Currently, many brothel owners have collectively joined the Liberal Democratic Party in an attempt to campaign to amend this law.

　　日本妓院老板送孽钱  执政党议员受贿犯案
    据新华社15日讯　东京消息：东京警察当局今天透露了一件妓院老板向执政的自由民主党议员大量行贿以阻止国会通过禁止卖淫的法律的案件。据说这个案件牵涉到自由民主党里的二十名政客。
    东京地方检察厅今天已经逮捕了由一万六千名妓院老板组成的“全国花柳病防止协会”的两个职员。警察说，这个妓院老板的组织在1955年国会讨论“卖春防止法”的时候，曾经向一些有影响的“政界人士”行贿达十万美元。
    警察说，自由民主党的议员真锅仪十将被传讯。这个议员当选的选区中有好几个有几百年历史的妓院区。
    禁止卖淫的法律——“卖春防止法”曾经五次被提交日本国会审议，都没有获得通过。去年5月，在舆论的压力下，日本国会才通过了这项法律。这项法律已经在今年4月生效，但是法律中的惩罚条款却要到明年4月才能生效。目前，已经有不少妓院老板集体加入了自由民主党，企图进行活动来修改这项法律。
