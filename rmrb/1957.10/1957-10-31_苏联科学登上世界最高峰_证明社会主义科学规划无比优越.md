Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 30th. The latest issue of the Soviet magazine "Party Life" published an article by the famous Soviet scientist Pokrovsky, discussing the important significance of Soviet socialist scientific planning for the development of Soviet science.

The article stated that there have been many significant scientific inventions and discoveries in human history, such as the invention of the steam engine, the radio, and the discovery of electricity and atomic energy. However, none of these inventions and discoveries have caused as much surprise and joy around the world as the first artificial satellite.

The successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite is a manifestation of the superiority of Soviet socialist scientific planning. Soviet socialist science and technology planning is formulated based on the interests of the people. It has the scale of the entire country and can quickly realize many of the most urgent tasks in the Soviet national economy and culture. At the same time, it has scientific foresight and can very rationally solve many long-term tasks in science and technology from a distance.

The article, when discussing the Soviet Union's research on rockets and artificial satellites, stated that the road to the successful launch of artificial satellites was opened up by the October Socialist Revolution and is the result of the development of socialist industry and all aspects of Soviet science and technology. As early as 1930 to 1932, the Soviet engineer Tsander created and tested the first batch of rocket engines. In 1933, the Soviet Union launched the first rocket propelled by a liquid jet engine, which was eleven years earlier than the famous German "V-2" rocket. In the years after the victory of the Great Patriotic War, rocket technology developed rapidly in the Soviet Union. The state first cultivated cadres to study and solve the complex task of conquering the universe. In the past ten years, Soviet scholars, engineers, and workers have carried out tremendous work to create powerful rockets that can rise hundreds of kilometers into the sky and travel more than a thousand kilometers. These rockets have been used for scientific research at high altitudes and to test the conditions of biological high-altitude flight. These studies and experiments have proved that it is entirely possible and safe for organisms and humans to ascend to high altitudes for short periods of time. As for the problem of humans staying in high altitudes for long periods of time, Soviet scientists are conducting further research.

A prerequisite for the Soviet Union's achievements in spaceflight is that this work is completely carried out on the basis of socialist science and technology planning. This planning system gives all participants in new and bold scientific and technological measures a deep confidence in the ultimate success of creative efforts. The socialist system makes the Soviet people firmly believe that their labor can be used to benefit the people. This is the best encouragement for scientific and technical personnel.

The Soviet Communist Party and the government have done everything possible to create conditions for scientific research, allocating the necessary funding, establishing many research institutes and laboratories, and extensively training engineering and technical cadres. Numerous scholars, inventors, and designers have been recruited to participate in the development of rocket technology. As a result of the tremendous work, the Soviet rocket industry is now able to solve any scientific research and national defense tasks.

Another major advantage of the Soviet Union in solving complex scientific and technological problems is that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system in solving the problem of national education. The budget allocations for maintaining schools in the United States have been repeatedly reduced, making it impossible for thousands of working people to receive education. But in the Soviet Union, there is a system that enables all young people and children to receive education. Now the number of scientific workers in Soviet universities and scientific research institutions has increased twenty-three times compared with before the October Revolution.

    苏联科学登上世界最高峰
    证明社会主义科学规划无比优越
    它是根据人民利益制订的，具有整个国家规模，能够迅速实现经济和文化中的迫切任务；能从远处着眼，合理地解决科学技术上的长远任务。
    新华社莫斯科30日电　苏联最近一期“党的生活”杂志发表了苏联著名科学家波克罗夫斯基的一篇文章，论述了苏联社会主义科学规划对苏联科学发展的重要意义。
    文章说，人类历史有过不少科学上的重大发明和发现，如蒸汽机、无线电的发明和电、原子能的发现等，但是，这些发明和发现都没有像第一颗人造卫星这样引起过全世界的惊奇和欢欣。
    苏联人造卫星的发射成功，是苏联社会主义科学规划优越性的表现。苏联社会主义科学和技术的规划是根据人民的利益制订的。它具有整个国家的规模，可以迅速地实现苏联国民经济和文化中许多最迫切的任务。同时，它具有科学的预见性，能够从远处着眼，非常合理地解决许多科学和技术上的长远的任务。
    文章在谈到苏联在研究火箭和人造卫星的情况时说，发射人造卫星成功的道路是十月社会主义革命开辟的，是社会主义工业和苏联各方面科学技术发展的结果。早在1930到1932年，苏联工程师粲德尔就创造了并试验了第一批火箭发动机。1933年，苏联就发射了第一颗用液体喷气发动机推进的火箭，这比德国有名的“V—2”式火箭还要早十一年。在卫国战争胜利结束后的年代里，火箭技术在苏联迅速地发展，国家首先培养了干部，以研究和解决征服宇宙的复杂任务。苏联的学者、工程师、工人们在最近十年来进行了巨大的工作，创造出强力的火箭，它们能够上升几百公里的高空，飞行一千公里以上的路程。这些火箭被应用来作为对高空进行科学研究和试验生物在高空飞行的情况之用。这些研究和试验证明了生物和人类在短时期内升入高空是完全可能而没有危险的，至于人类长时期在高空的问题，苏联科学家正在作进一步的研究。
    苏联在宇宙飞行方面的成就的先决条件是这方面的工作完全是在社会主义科学和技术规划的基础上进行的。这种规划制度使一切新的大胆的科学技术措施的参加者对创造性努力的最后成功具有深刻的信心。社会主义制度使得苏维埃人深信自己的劳动能够用来为人民谋福利。这是对科学技术人员的最好的鼓励。
    苏联共产党和政府尽一切可能为科学研究工作创造了条件，拨付了必须的经费，创办了许多研究所和实验室，广泛地训练培养工程技术干部。众多的学者、发明家、设计家被吸收来参加发展火箭技术的工作。由于进行了巨大工作的结果，苏联的火箭工业现在已经能够解决任何科学研究和国防上的任务。
    苏联对于解决复杂科学技术问题的另一个最大的优越性，在于社会主义制度解决国民教育问题比资本主义制度优越。美国维持学校的预算拨款一再缩减，使得成千上万的劳动人民无法接受教育。但在苏联却有使所有青年和儿童都受教育的制度。现在苏联高等学校和科学研究机关的科学工作人员比十月革命前已经增加了二十三倍。
