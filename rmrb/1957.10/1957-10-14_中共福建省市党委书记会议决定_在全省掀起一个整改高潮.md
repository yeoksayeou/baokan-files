Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, October 13th: Units in Fujian Province that have achieved a decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle are about to launch an upsurge in improving work and improving style. This was decided at a recent meeting of provincial, prefectural, municipal, and university Party committee secretaries convened by the Fujian Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

More than 50,000 people participating in the rectification movement in directly subordinate organs of the Fujian Province, prefectures, and cities, as well as universities, have put forward a large number of opinions during the "big blooming and contending," more than 90% of which are well-intentioned and basically correct, playing a significant role in improving leadership and work. In particular, the units that have fully implemented "blooming and contending" and paid attention to rectification alongside modifications have seen even more significant results. Currently, apart from a few units where the anti-Rightist struggle is still continuing in depth, most units in the province have achieved a decisive victory. Therefore, the meeting decided that these units should promptly focus their main efforts on improving work and improving style. This stage mainly involves seriously criticizing and combating bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in work and style, to achieve the goals of raising awareness, rectifying style, streamlining institutions, increasing production and practicing economy, improving systems, improving work, and strengthening unity.

The meeting believes that the most fundamental prerequisite for improving work and improving style is that leading cadres must have determination and the broad masses must have confidence. The meeting pointed out that the leadership of many units currently lacks determination and enthusiasm for continuing "blooming and contending" and improving work. This is mainly due to insufficient understanding of the importance of the rectification and modification stage and the severity and harm of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in their work. Some have developed serious complacency after achieving a decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, only seeing the achievements in their work and failing to see the shortcomings and errors. A few people do not fully grasp the policy spirit of the rectification movement, and coupled with individualistic tendencies, they fear "getting burned" and "losing face," etc., and therefore adopt a passive attitude towards rectification and modification.

The meeting analyzed the reasons why some of the masses lacked confidence in "big blooming and contending" and the leadership correcting errors and shortcomings, believing that the main reasons were fear of being labeled as Rightists and fear of retaliation. Some had raised many opinions in the past, but the leadership had been slow to correct them, resulting in a lack of confidence.

In order to do a good job in rectification alongside modifications, the meeting emphasized that in addition to clearly expressing their attitude and determination regarding the various concerns of the masses, leaders at all levels must also humbly accept the opinions of the masses and immediately resolve some of the problems that can be resolved. It is also necessary to treat rectification alongside modifications as a movement to re-mobilize and re-launch an upsurge. The leadership should mainly focus on two ends: first, boldly encouraging the masses to "bloom and contend;" second, resolutely modify and thoroughly change. "Blooming" should be carried out from top to bottom, inside and out, with everything that needs to be said, said. Fully utilize the role of big-character posters and fully utilize various meeting formats for "blooming and contending." Grassroots units can put up big-character posters in leading organs; leading cadres should take the initiative to go deep into the grassroots and among the masses to solicit opinions and conduct investigations and research. It is necessary to combine the rectification movement in the organs with the in-depth "big blooming, big contending, and big debating" at the grassroots level, and not conduct rectification behind closed doors. In rectification alongside modifications, the spirit of seriousness, gentleness, seeking truth from facts, and "unity – criticism – unity" should be implemented, and the method of presenting facts, reasoning, promoting democracy, and following the mass line should be used to achieve consistency between leaders and those being led, and to strengthen unity.

The meeting required that the rectification alongside modifications be carried out both quickly and steadily. Throughout the stage of improving work, it is imperative to firmly believe in the masses, fully implement the mass line, and achieve rectification alongside modifications, allowing the two to be organically combined and mutually reinforcing. Debates should be allowed even when there are different opinions, but they must be conducted on the basis of full "blooming and contending" and thorough modification, so as not to let debates affect the enthusiasm of the masses for "blooming and contending."

　　中共福建省市党委书记会议决定
    在全省掀起一个整改高潮
    新华社福州13日电　福建省反右派斗争已经取得决定性胜利的单位，将要掀起一个改进工作、改进作风的高潮。这是中共福建省委最近召开的省、地、市委和大专学校党委书记会议上决定的。
    福建省省、地、市直属机关和大专学校中参加整风运动的五万多人，在大放大鸣中提出了大量意见，其中有90％以上是善意的和基本上正确的，对改善领导、改进工作起了很大作用，特别是鸣放得充分和注意边整边改工作的单位，成效更为显著。目前全省的反右派斗争除少数单位仍在继续深入开展外，多数单位已取得了决定性胜利。因此，会议决定这些单位应该及时地把主要力量放在改进工作和改进作风上。这个阶段主要是严肃批判和反掉工作上和作风上的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，达到提高认识、整顿作风、紧缩机构、增产节约、健全制度、改进工作和加强团结的目的。
    会议认为：要改进工作、改进作风，最根本的前提是在于领导干部要有决心和广大群众要有信心。会议指出目前不少单位的领导对继续鸣放和改进工作的决心和劲头不大，这主要是对边整边改阶段的重要意义和对工作中存在的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的严重性与危害性认识不足。有的在反右派斗争取得决定性胜利后产生了严重的骄傲自满情绪，只看到工作中的成绩，看不到缺点和错误；少数人对整风的政策精神领会不够，加以个人主义作怪，怕“惹火烧身”，怕“丢面子”等等，因而对边整边改采取消极的态度。
    会议分析了有些群众对大鸣大放和领导改正错误、缺点的信心不高的原因，认为主要是怕戴右派帽子，怕打击报复；有的是过去提过许多意见，但领导上迟迟未改正，因而信心不足。
    为了搞好边整边改，会议强调各级领导除了应就群众的各种顾虑明确表示态度和决心外，更重要的是要虚心接受群众意见，立即解决一些可以解决的问题。还必须把边整边改当作一个运动来重新动员，重新掀起高潮。领导上主要抓两头：一是大胆放手鼓励群众鸣放；一是狠狠地改，坚决地改。应当上下内外一齐放，有什么放什么。充分发挥大字报的作用和充分运用各种会议的鸣放形式。基层单位可到领导机关贴大字报；领导干部要主动深入基层、深入群众征求意见，调查研究，必须把机关的整风和深入基层同基层的大放大鸣大辩论结合起来，不能关门整风。在边整边改中，要贯彻严肃认真、和风细雨、实事求是和“团结——批评——团结”的精神，用摆事实、讲道理、发扬民主、走群众路线的办法，达到领导与被领导一致，加强团结。
    会议要求边整边改工作要进行得既迅速又稳妥。整个改进工作的阶段必须坚决相信群众，充分贯彻群众路线，作到边放边改、边改边放，使放、改二者有机地结合起来，互相推动，有不同意见也应允许辩论，但必须在充分鸣放和狠狠改的基础上去展开辩论，不要因为辩论影响群众鸣放的积极性。
