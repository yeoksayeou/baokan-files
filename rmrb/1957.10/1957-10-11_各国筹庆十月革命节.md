　　Countries Prepare to Celebrate the October Revolution Anniversary
    Hungary Issues Propaganda Outline
    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 10th - The newspapers here published on the 9th a propaganda outline from the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government regarding the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    The outline stated that the significance of the October Revolution extended far beyond the borders of one country. This revolution and the worker's regime established in the Soviet Union are examples and models for all the exploited people of the world. The outline pointed out that currently, the imperialist anti-Soviet propaganda has intensified considerably. Under the pressure of American imperialists, the United Nations recently discussed the so-called "Hungarian Question" report, one of the main purposes of which was to denigrate and slander the Soviet Union, which for forty years has been the pillar of progressive forces worldwide.

    The outline called on the working class to steadfastly support the principle of friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union, as this principle conforms to the program of safeguarding and developing their own democratic and socialist achievements, and to the program of our country's peace and independence.

    The outline stated that all working people should understand and appreciate that this anniversary is not just a festival for Communists, but also a festival for all the people of our country. Forty years ago, a new force emerged on the world historical stage in Russia, and this force had a decisive influence on the development of the Hungarian nation. They helped the Hungarian working class, which had been oppressed for centuries, to stand up and seize power. The outline emphasized that the central idea of Hungary's celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution lies in the organic and inseparable link between the progress of the Hungarian nation and the Great October Socialist Revolution, and it is necessary to make the broad masses of all strata of Hungarian society aware of this.

    The outline finally talked about the counter-revolutionary events organized by imperialism in Hungary last October, and put forward the tasks currently facing the Hungarian people. The outline emphasized that the main task now is to eliminate the poison left by the counter-revolution in the economic and ideological fields, and to create political, economic, and ideological conditions for achieving new and rapid development, so as to comprehensively build socialism.

    Nationwide Celebration Activities Unfold in Czechoslovakia
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th - Various celebration activities commemorating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution are being widely carried out throughout Czechoslovakia. The socialist labor competition launched at the beginning of this year in factories and agricultural production cooperatives across the country to commemorate this great festival is still in full swing. In this competition, workers and farmers have so far increased production and saved more than one billion crowns (Czech currency) for the country.

    The branch associations of the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Association in various states of Czechoslovakia held delegate congresses last week one after another, and carried out a series of activities celebrating the October Revolution around these meetings. The General Association of the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Association will also hold a national congress with 700 participants on the 19th and 20th of this month. In addition, various small meetings were held in factories, villages, and towns, with people who had visited the Soviet Union reporting on the achievements of Soviet construction they had personally witnessed. A Soviet Old Bolshevik delegation currently visiting Czechoslovakia is also meeting with working people everywhere, telling them stories of the October Revolution and the deeds of Soviet revolutionary leaders.

    In order to celebrate the October Revolution, Prague, Bratislava and many other cities have also held and will hold exhibitions introducing the achievements of the Soviet Union in various aspects of construction over the past forty years.

    Mongolia Forms Celebration Preparatory Committee
    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 10th - Jambalsuren, acting director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, told Xinhua reporters about Mongolia's preparations for celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, saying that according to the resolution of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee, Mongolia has formed a preparatory committee for celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Damba, the First Secretary of the Party Central Committee, is the Chairman, and Surenjab, the Second Secretary, is the Vice-Chairman, with fourteen members including Tsedenbal, Sambu, and all members and alternate members of the Political Bureau.

    Currently, organizations such as the Youth League, the Trade Union, the Women's Federation, and the Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Association are carrying out various celebration preparations in a planned manner. Preparatory work has also been carried out in factories, enterprises, schools, and offices.

    The activities of the "Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Month," which is part of the celebration, have already begun. Currently, the preparatory committee is preparing a large-scale photo exhibition introducing "The October Revolution and the Mongolian People's Republic."

　　各国筹庆十月革命节
    匈牙利发布宣传提纲
    新华社布达佩斯10日电　这里的报纸9日发布了匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会和匈牙利工农革命政府关于庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的宣传提纲。
    提纲说，十月革命的意义远远地越出了一国的范围。这次革命及在苏联所建立的工人政权，对全世界被剥削的人们是一个范例和榜样。提纲指出，现在，帝国主义的反苏宣传特别加紧了。在美国帝国主义者的压力下，联合国在不久以前讨论了所谓“匈牙利问题”的报告，这样做的主要目的之一在于，诋毁和诽谤四十年来一直是全世界进步力量的支柱的苏联。
    提纲号召劳动阶级应该坚定不移地拥护同苏联友好联盟的主张，因为这种主张符合维护和发展他们自己的民主和社会主义成果的纲领，符合我国的和平和独立的纲领。
    提纲说，应该使全体劳动人民了解到并且体会到，这次纪念不只是共产党人的节日，而且是我国全体人民的节日。四十年前，在俄国一支新的力量登上了世界历史舞台，这个力量对匈牙利民族的发展起了决定性的影响。他们帮助数百年来受压迫的匈牙利劳动阶级站起来，并且取得了政权。提纲强调说，匈牙利庆祝十月革命四十周年的中心思想在于：匈牙利民族的进步和伟大十月社会主义革命之间存在着有机的和不可分割的联系，必须使匈牙利各阶层的广大群众意识到这一点。
    提纲最后谈到了去年10月帝国主义在匈牙利组织的反革命事件，并且提出了匈牙利人民目前面临的任务。提纲着重指出，现在的主要任务是消除反革命在经济方面和思想意识方面所留下的毒害，创造政治、经济和思想条件，取得新的迅速的发展，以便全面建成社会主义。
    捷全国展开庆祝活动
    据新华社布拉格10日电　纪念十月社会主义革命四十周年的各种庆祝活动，正在捷克斯洛伐克全国各地广泛展开。为纪念这一伟大节日而在今年年初在全国各工厂和农业生产合作社展开的社会主义劳动竞赛现在仍在热烈进行。在这一竞赛中，工人和农民到目前为止已经为国家增产节约了十多亿克朗（捷币名）。
    捷克斯洛伐克各州的捷苏友好协会分会上星期先后举行了代表大会，并且围绕着这些会议进行了一连串的庆祝十月革命节的活动。捷苏友好协会总会也将在本月19日和20日举行有七百人参加的全国代表大会。此外，各工厂、村庄、城镇还举行了各种小型会议，由访问过苏联的人报告他们亲自见到的苏联建设成就。目前正在捷克斯洛伐克各地访问的一个苏联老布尔什维克代表团也到处和劳动人民会面，向他们讲述十月革命的故事和苏联革命领袖的事迹。
    为了庆祝十月革命节，布拉格、布拉迪斯拉发和其他许多城市还举办和将举办展览会，介绍苏联四十年来各方面建设的成就。
    蒙古组成庆祝筹委会
    据新华社乌兰巴托10日电　蒙古人民革命党中央宣传部代理部长江布拉苏伦向新华社记者谈蒙古筹备庆祝十月革命四十周年的情况说，根据党中央政治局的决议，蒙古已经组成庆祝十月革命四十周年的筹备委员会。党中央第一书记达姆巴任主任委员，第二书记苏伦扎布任副主任委员，包括泽登巴尔、桑布等全体政治局委员和候补委员在内的十四人为委员。
    目前，青年团、工会、妇联和蒙苏友好协会等团体正在有计划地进行各种庆祝筹备工作。工厂、企业、学校、机关中也开展了筹备工作。
    作为庆祝活动一部分的“蒙苏友好月”的活动已经开始。目前，筹备委员会正在准备一个介绍“十月革命和蒙古人民共和国”的大型图片展览。
