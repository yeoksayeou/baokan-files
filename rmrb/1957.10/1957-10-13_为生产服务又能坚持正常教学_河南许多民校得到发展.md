Serving Production While Maintaining Normal Teaching
Many Henan Civil Schools Develop

(Our Dispatch) Many civil schools in Henan Province, by integrating production and rural socialist education with teaching, have been consolidated and developed.

Civil schools in counties like Lingbao and Bo'ai are able to persist in learning during busy farming seasons. During the intense drought resistance work, the Dawang Agricultural Cooperative's civil school in Dawang Township, Lingbao County, had 132 students who actively carried water to fight the drought during the day and persisted in studying at night. Students at the Beizhuying Civil School in Taizizhuang Township, Bo'ai County, persisted in learning during the busy farming season and the socialist education movement, earning high praise from the masses. Feng Yujie said, "Civil school students have three goods: good at production, good at propaganda, and good at learning."

Civil schools in counties like Suiping, Yichuan, Xingyang, Changge, and Jiyuan combine the rural socialist education movement with the work of eliminating illiteracy and promoting cultural education in rural areas. In Suiping County, civil schools, led by production team leaders and teachers, organized students into propaganda and debate groups. These groups were assigned specific areas to cover, collecting materials and understanding the thoughts of the masses, playing a significant role. Some civil schools used debate groups as study groups, explaining policies and learning culture before meetings, and holding discussions after class. Some civil schools studied for an hour in the afternoon, assigning the content for the evening debate, and also utilized meeting intervals and field breaks for tutoring or self-study. Some civil school teachers and students used production gaps to talk with the masses and conduct debates. Many civil school teachers also compiled materials such as "State Purchase and Marketing is Extremely Beneficial," "Strike at Illegal Landlords and Rich Peasant Elements," and "The Ten Great Things About Socialism," which were printed and distributed to students for study. Under the leadership of Party organizations, many civil schools paid attention to promoting learning, production, and socialist ideological education together, satisfying cadres, teachers, and students.

During this socialist education movement, the active participation of civil school teachers and students achieved remarkable results. The Party committee further valued civil schools, strengthening its leadership over them, enabling civil schools to both serve production and maintain normal learning. At the same time, it consolidated and developed civil schools through socialist education.

    河南许多民校得到发展
    本报讯　河南省许多民校结合生产和农村社会主义教育，坚持教学，得到巩固和发展。
    灵宝、博爱等县民校都能在农忙中坚持学习。在紧张的抗旱工作中，灵宝大王乡大王农业社民校，有一百三十二个学员，白天积极担水抗旱，晚上坚持学习。博爱县太子庄乡北朱营民校学员，在农忙和社会主义教育运动中坚持学习，深受群众的赞扬。冯玉杰说：“民校学员有三好：生产好，宣传好，学习好”。
    遂平、伊川、荥阳、长葛和济源等县民校结合农村社会主义教育运动，开展农村扫除文盲与文化教育工作。遂平县各民校以生产队长、教师为主，将学员组织成宣传辩论小组。宣传辩论小组分片包干，收集材料，了解群众思想，发挥了很大的作用。有的民校，以辩论组为学习小组，会前讲解政策，学习文化，课后开会讨论。有的民校，在午后学习一小时，随布置晚上辩论的内容，还利用会议前后，田间休息的时间进行包教或自学。有的民校教师、学员利用生产空隙和群众谈心，开展辩论。许多民校教师还编写了“统购统销好处多”、“打击不法地主富农分子”、“社会主义十大好”等材料，印发给学员学习。在党组织的领导下，许多民校注意把学习、生产和社会主义思想教育一齐推动起来，使干部、教师和学员都满意。
    在这次社会主义教育运动中，民校教师和学员的积极参加，取得了显著成绩。党委对民校进一步的重视，加强了对民校的领导，使民校既为生产服务，又能坚持正常学习；同时使民校在社会主义教育中得到了巩固和发展。
