Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd, dispatch from TASS, Paris: The French Communist Party Central Committee Politburo issued a statement on October 2nd regarding the government crisis, saying that the rejection of the Algerian "Fundamental Law" bill in the National Assembly and the beginning of the government crisis are "a disastrous defeat for the military policy in Algeria and a great victory for the growing resistance of the French people to this war."

The statement said, "The ranks of the warmongers are seriously divided. Therefore, the voting situation in the National Assembly not only reflects the people's desire for peace, but also reflects the disintegration of the group that had previously unanimously supported this war under the influence of this desire for peace."

The Politburo pointed out that the fall of the Bourgès-Maunoury government particularly illustrates that it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage the country if the interests of the working class and the interests of the people are violated. The Politburo condemned attempts to "form a government that continues, or even further strengthens, the current policy."

The statement said, "The French Communist Party calls on all French people who oppose the Algerian war, especially the twelve million French citizens who voted for left-wing parties on January 2, 1956, to unite in these days of government crisis and express their common desire for change and peace."

Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd, dispatch from TASS, Paris: Amid the continuing French government crisis, the current session of the National Assembly formally opened on October 1st, and elections for the speakers of the National Assembly, the Senate of the Republic, and the Assembly of the French Union were held separately.

In the National Assembly, according to regulations, the meeting was presided over by the oldest member, the communist Marcel Cachin.

In his speech, Cachin spoke of the domestic political situation in France, which is characterized by the increasing division and contradictions among the parties in the parliament, while the interests of France and peace require them to unite.

Cachin called on the members to pay attention to the abnormal fact that "such a large country as New China" is temporarily unable to participate in the work of the United Nations. He emphasized that this unprecedented mistake must be corrected as soon as possible.

Cachin then requested the National Assembly to immediately mediate the conflict in Algeria in accordance with "wise and fair solutions" in order to end the "increasingly fierce war that will bankrupt France."

After Cachin's speech, the National Assembly proceeded to hold the election of the speaker. The Socialist Party member Le Troquer was elected Speaker of the National Assembly with 308 votes.

    法共政治局就政府危机发表声明
    号召法国人民团结争取变革
    加香在国民议会中要求立即结束阿尔及利亚战争
    据新华社3日讯  塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会政治局10月2日就政府危机发表声明说，阿尔及利亚“根本法”法案在国民议会遭到否决以及政府危机的开始，是“在阿尔及利亚的军事政策的惨败，是法国人民对这个战争日益增长的抵制的巨大胜利”。
    声明说，“好战者的战线严重地分裂了。因此，国民议会的投票情况不仅反映了人民对和平的渴望，也反映了在这种渴望和平的影响下过去曾一致支持这个战争的集团已经瓦解”。
    政治局指出，布歇—莫努里政府的倒台特别说明了，如果违背工人阶级的利益，违背人民的利益，那么管理国家就越来越困难了。政治局谴责打算“成立一个继续进行、甚至进一步加强当前政策的政府”的企图。
    声明说，“法国共产党号召一切反对阿尔及利亚战争的法国人，特别是在1956年1月2日投票选举左翼各政党的一千二百万法国公民，在政府危机的这些日子里团结起来，表示他们对变革与和平的共同愿望”。
    据新华社3日讯  据塔斯社巴黎讯：在法国政府危机持续声中，国民议会的本届会议于10月1日正式开幕，并且分别举行了国民议会、共和国参议院和法兰西联邦议会议长的选举。
    在国民议会上，按规定会议由年纪最大的议员、共产党人马赛尔·加香主持。
    加香在致词中谈到了法国国内政治形势，这一形势的特点是议会内各党派之间的分裂和矛盾日益加深，而法国和和平的利益却要求它们团结一致。
    加香吁请议员们注意这个反常的事实：“新中国这样一个大国”竟暂时不能参加联合国的工作。他强调指出，必须尽快纠正这种闻所未闻的错误。
    加香接着要求国民议会按照“英明和公正的解决办法”立即调解阿尔及利亚的冲突，以结束那“越来越是激烈并且会使法国破产的战争”。
    在加香的致词结束后，国民议会接着举行了议长选举。社会党人勒特罗盖以三百零八票当选为国民议会议长。
