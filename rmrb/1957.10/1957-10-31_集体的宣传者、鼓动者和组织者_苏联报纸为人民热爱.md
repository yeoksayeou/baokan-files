Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 30th: The Soviet Union now publishes 7,537 newspapers, with a total circulation of 53.5 million copies per issue, almost twenty times more than in pre-revolutionary 1913.

    Newspapers have now become an indispensable part of the spiritual food of the Soviet people. On average, one newspaper is subscribed to for every four people.

    The broad reach of Soviet newspaper publishing can be seen from its regional distribution. In addition to 24 national newspapers, the Soviet Union also has 151 republic newspapers, 99 autonomous republic and autonomous region newspapers, 317 border region and state newspapers, more than 4,800 city and district newspapers, and more than 2,100 factory and state farm newspapers.

    In order to attract working people of all nationalities to widely participate in national political life and develop the socialist culture of many nationalities, the Soviet Union publishes more than 2,500 newspapers in 60 ethnic minority languages, in addition to Russian. Some of these minority languages were created after the revolution.

    For forty years, Soviet newspapers have actively played their role as collective propagandists, agitators, and organizers. To strengthen propaganda and agitation work among agricultural workers, a new type of newspaper—the collective farm newspaper—appeared in the Soviet Union last year. Collective farms in various places are establishing these newspapers, and many farm workers directly participate in the editing of the newspapers and actively publish their opinions, exchange production experiences, and criticize shortcomings in production in the newspapers.

    Soviet newspapers and periodicals play an important role in promoting industrial and agricultural technological progress and improving production organization. Newspapers use methods such as close ties with enterprises and organizing worker-peasant correspondents to actively delve into pressing issues in the production sector, widely publish these issues in newspapers and periodicals, and disseminate the advanced experience of production innovators.

    Soviet newspapers maintain close ties with the broad masses of the people. For example, last year, the central newspapers alone received more than one million letters from readers, an increase of 140,000 compared with 1955.

    At the same time, the circulation of Soviet periodicals has also developed rapidly since the October Revolution. Last year, more than 2,500 periodicals were published nationwide, with a total circulation of 418.5 million copies. More than 40 new magazines were published in the Soviet Union in the first quarter of this year.

    苏联报纸为人民热爱
    据新华社莫斯科30日电　苏联现在出版着七千五百三十七种报纸，每期发行总额达五千三百五十万份，几乎增加为革命前1913年的二十倍。
    现在，报纸已经成了苏联人民每日不可缺少的精神食粮，平均每四个人就订有一份报纸。
    苏联报纸出版的广泛性可以从分布地区看出来。目前除了全国性的报纸二十四种外，苏联还有一百五十一种共和国报纸、九十九种自治共和国和自治州报纸、三百十七种边疆区和州报、四千八百多种市和区报、二千一百多种工厂和国营农场的报纸。
    为了吸引各民族的劳动人民广泛参加国家政治生活和发展多民族的社会主义文化，苏联除了用俄文出版报纸外，还用六十种民族文字出版二千五百多种报纸，其中有些民族文字是在革命后才创立的。
    四十年来，苏联报纸积极发挥作为集体的宣传者、鼓动者和组织者的作用。为了加强对农业劳动者的宣传鼓动工作，去年苏联出现了一种新型的报纸——集体农庄报纸。各地的集体农庄都在创办这种报纸，许多农庄的工作人员直接参加报纸的编辑工作，并积极在报纸上发表自己的意见，交换生产经验，对生产中的缺点进行批评。
    苏联的报刊在推动工农业技术进步和改善生产组织方面发挥着重要的作用。报纸用密切和企业联系、组织工农通讯员积极分子的方法来深入地研究生产部门的迫切问题，把这些问题在报刊上广泛登载，并传播生产革新者的先进经验。
    苏联报纸经常与广大群众保持着密切的联系。例如，去年仅中央各报就收到了一百万封以上的读者来信，比1955年增加了十四万封。
    同时，苏联的期刊发行在十月革命后也有了迅速的发展。去年全国出版了二千五百多种刊物，共出版四亿一千八百五十万份。今年第一季度苏联又出版了四十多种新杂志。
