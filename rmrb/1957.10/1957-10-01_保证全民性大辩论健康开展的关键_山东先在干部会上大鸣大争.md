The national rectification movement in Shandong Province is unfolding in the vast countryside in batches after extensive airing of views and debates at the three-level or four-level cadre meetings in various counties. Generally, the approach is to first hold an enlarged meeting of the prefectural party committee to convey the instructions of the central and provincial party committees, initially analyze and study the rural situation, resolve the ideological problems of the county party secretaries, and study the methods. Then, three-level or four-level cadre meetings are convened, focusing first on resolving the ideological problems of township and commune cadres. On this basis, extensive airing of views and debates are launched in the townships and communes in batches. At present, except for the heavily disaster-stricken areas of Heze and Jining, where counties are still holding three-level cadre meetings, the province is launching extensive airing of views and debates in townships and communes in batches.

The Necessity of Extensive Airing of Views and Debates at Cadre Meetings

The three-level or four-level cadre meetings in various counties generally include the participation of key responsible cadres from townships and communes, lasting from about ten days to half a month. The format of the meetings generally involves the leading cadres of the county party committee giving mobilization and enlightening reports, conducting extensive airing of views and debates around central issues such as grain and cooperativization to clarify major issues of right and wrong; then, the county party committee makes a summary to further draw lines between right and wrong and raise awareness; finally, specific arrangements are made on how to carry out socialist education among the masses, clarifying basic methods and policy boundaries.

Shandong's experience proves that earnestly holding such meetings is the key to ensuring the smooth and healthy development of the national rectification movement in townships and communes. This is because: First, since the spring, due to the rise of capitalist ideas in the countryside, the grain and cooperative movements became very tense for a time, and some cadres attempted to solve the problem by means of suppression. Since the implementation of Chairman Mao's instruction on "Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People," most cadres have shared weal and woe with the masses and participated in labor, and their work style has undergone significant changes. However, due to an incomplete understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions and the inability to distinguish between contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, there has been a phenomenon of letting capitalist ideas and the anti-socialist remarks of landlords and rich peasants run rampant without daring to deal with them. Under these circumstances, most cadres are working with a stiff upper lip, while some are afraid of difficulties and are considering resigning after the autumn harvest. When various localities convened three-level cadre meetings this time, the cadres who attended initially mostly reflected that the work below was becoming increasingly difficult, complaining that they had suffered a lot during this period, and blaming the leadership and the political and legal departments for not supporting them. Some even mistakenly believed that the reason there were so many problems in the countryside during this period was due to "Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People." Especially after the anti-rightist struggle was launched in the cities, upon hearing that the county was holding a meeting, they thought that the current policy was about to change (meaning that the method of persuasion and education could no longer be used to correctly handle contradictions among the people), and they were preparing to receive a "new spirit" (meaning to restore coercive orders) so that they could go back to "govern people" and vent the anger they had suffered in the past six months. After hearing that the method of airing views and debates would be used to first unify ideological understanding, and then study how to do a good job in socialist education after returning, they felt that this approach could not solve the problem and generated a lot of resistance. This shows that if the ideological problems of this group of people are not resolved first through the three-level cadre meeting, and they are not made to clearly understand the purpose and significance, policies, and practices of socialist education, it will be difficult to ensure that no deviations occur when carrying out socialist education in the countryside.

Second, in the previous period, among the district, township, and commune cadres, in addition to the majority who had firm socialist stances, there were also some cadres whose direction was blurred under the impact of capitalist ideas, and who wavered on the issues of cooperativization and the unified purchase and sale of grain. Some had relatively serious right-leaning ideas, departmentalism, and capitalist ideas. If their ideas are not first criticized through airing views and debates, and their ideological awareness is not raised, there will be no conditions to do a good job in socialist education for the peasants.

Third, the method of extensive airing of views and debates is unfamiliar to the vast majority of rural cadres, and they have no experience with it. What they are accustomed to is the old method of having leading cadres give reports, etc. First airing views and debating at the three-level cadre meeting can not only solve their ideological problems more thoroughly, but also enable them to consciously accept and learn to use the working method of the mass line of airing views and debating through demonstrations and personal experiences in small and large meetings.

Extensive Airing of Views and Debates Can Truly Solve Cadres' Ideological Problems

At the three-level cadre meeting, can the method of airing views and debates be used to solve the ideological problems of the cadres attending the meeting? Initially, the leading cadres at all levels were not sure about this, mainly because they were worried that under the influence of the anti-rightist struggle in the cities, nothing would be released, and they were also afraid that the meeting would be prolonged, affecting the current production. The cadres who attended the meeting initially did have many concerns. Some felt that their opinions would be useless, and some were afraid that if they raised incorrect opinions, they would be labeled as rightists and struggled against. However, facts have proved that as long as the leadership is good, airing of views can be done. The method is: first, the leading cadres of the county party committee should make a mobilization report, asking everyone to help the county party committee in the rectification movement; and explain that there are many problems in the current rural grain and cooperative movements, and there are different views, so everyone can put forward their opinions and views on these issues. Correct opinions can help improve leadership and work, and incorrect opinions can improve their understanding through leadership debates. Then prescribe the right medicine to effectively solve various rural problems. Then, in the group, the leading backbone takes the lead in airing views, and listens to incorrect ideas with a hard head, without rushing to provoke debates, let alone randomly labeling and suppressing them. In this way, it can develop from raising positive opinions to speaking out boldly, and from general problems to focusing on central issues. At a certain temperature, some people said: "Even if I am beheaded and shot, I will speak even if I am not a cadre." Looking at the main issues raised at the three-level cadre meetings in various places, in terms of the unified purchase and sale of grain, the main issues are: "The grain shortage is brought about by the unified purchase and sale," "The state buys too much grain, digging too hard for the peasants," "The grain ration standard is too low, not enough to eat," "The implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy is an official forcing the people to rebel," advocating "Rather resist one family (the state) than offend thousands of households (peasants), and don't get beaten by the peasants on this issue," and so on. In terms of cooperativization: some believe that "cooperativization has advanced rashly and taken too fast steps," and some fundamentally deny the superiority of cooperativization, believing that "advanced cooperatives are not as good as elementary cooperatives, elementary cooperatives are not as good as mutual aid teams, and mutual aid teams are not as good as individual households," "Cooperatives get poorer in one year and poorer for ten years, and after a few more years, the common people will not even have chaff and vegetables to eat," and some advocate turning back, changing advanced cooperatives to elementary cooperatives, and so on. After these erroneous ideas were exposed, methods such as presenting facts, reasoning, recalling comparisons, and calculating accounts were adopted at the group meetings to launch debates to criticize and refute them. Then, debates were held in the general assembly with anti-socialist elements who were exposed and key figures with serious capitalist ideas.

After doing this, the ideological problems are solved more thoroughly in places where the views are released more thoroughly. Some cadres said after raising their awareness: "We live a socialist life, but we have capitalist thoughts in our minds. The more we look at socialism with capitalist ideas, the more awkward we feel. This time, my heart is bright."

Extensive Airing of Views and Debates Can Clarify Many Situations in Rural Areas and Among Cadres

In places where the three-level cadre meetings are well held, the leadership can also clarify several baselines:

First, the baseline of grain. In the past, it was generally said that 360 jin per year was not enough to eat. This time, everyone told the truth. The actual amount of grain retained in many places exceeds 360 jin. Even if it is 360 jin per person, as long as you are frugal and eat evenly, most households can get by. According to the analysis of Mengyin and other counties: 60% of households have enough to eat, 30% of households have a surplus, and 5%-10% of households do not have enough to eat. Among the 685 semi-detached cadres in Huang County, after their awareness was raised, they reported the actual grain situation at home: 515 households had surplus grain, accounting for 75.2% of the total number of households, with more than 89,000 jin of surplus grain, an average of 174 jin per household. 102 households had enough to eat, accounting for 14.8%. 68 households lacked grain, accounting for 10%. The summer purchase task this year was not completed. In addition to the lower output than last year, there were indeed big ideological problems. Changle County revealed that among the more than 4,100 cooperatives in the county, there were 268 problematic places in the purchase. Among them, 66 places distributed too much grain, 21 places stole grain, 51 places increased the conversion rate, 100 places retained too many seeds, and 30 places concealed wheat, which caused the state to purchase more than 600,000 jin less grain.

Second, the baseline of cooperativization. In the first year after cooperativization in Yidu County—1956, the total grain output reached more than 320 million jin, an increase of 23.9% over 1955. Among the 246 cooperatives in the county, 115 were relatively stable, accounting for 46.7%, 100 were basically stable, accounting for 40.6%, and 31 were backward, accounting for 12.7%.

Third, the baseline of cadres. According to statistics from Yidu County: among the 1,343 cadres attending the meeting, 10%-15% had committed errors such as corruption, concealing output, resisting unified purchase tasks, and engaging in grain speculation activities. Among the 882 cadres attending the meeting in Linyi County, 266 people reviewed the expansion of disaster, suppression of output, overreporting of population, and attempts to reduce the sales of purchase tasks, accounting for 30.1%, 92 people reviewed the spring uproar, accounting for 10.4%, 91 people shouted that 360 jin of grain ration was not enough to eat, accounting for 10.3%, 5 people engaged in grain speculation, accounting for 0.5%, 18 people made trouble to withdraw from the cooperative and work alone, accounting for 2%, and 3 people sheltered landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, accounting for 0.3%.

In short, all those who have earnestly held three-level cadre meetings can achieve the following more obvious effects:

(1) Criticize the right-leaning ideas, departmentalism, and capitalism among cadres, draw a clear line between major issues of right and wrong, and raise the ideological awareness of cadres;

(2) Recognize the current struggle situation between the two roads in the countryside and improve the cadres' awareness of carrying out socialist education;

(3) Initially learn to use the method of airing views and debates. This is not only conducive to the development of the current rural debate but also lays a better foundation for changing the cadre's coercive command style.

    保证全民性大辩论健康开展的关键
    山东先在干部会上大鸣大争
    本报讯  山东省的全民性整风运动，在各县的三级或四级干部会议上大鸣大放大争以后，正分批在广大乡村展开。各地一般都是先开地委扩大会议，传达中央与省委指示，初步分析研究农村情况，解决县委书记的思想问题，研究做法。随即召开三级或四级干部会议，首先集中全力解决乡社干部的思想问题。在这一基础上，再分批在乡社展开大鸣大放和大辩论。目前全省除菏泽、济宁两个重灾地区各县尚在召开三级干部会议外，正先后分批展开乡社的大鸣大放大辩论。
    在干部会上展开大鸣大争有充分的必要性
    各县的三级或四级干部会议，一般都吸收了乡社主要负责干部参加，时间是十天左右到半个月。会议的开法，一般是由县委领导干部做动员启发报告，围绕粮食、合作化等中心问题，进行大鸣大放大争，弄清大是大非；然后，由县委作总结，进一步划清是非界限，提高认识；最后，再对如何对群众展开社会主义教育，进行具体部署，把基本做法和政策界限等问题交代清楚。
    山东的经验证明，认真开好这样的会议，是保证在乡社顺利而健康地开展全民性整风运动的关键。这是因为：第一，今春以来，农村中由于资本主义思想的抬头，闹粮、闹社一时搞得很紧张，当时有些干部企图用压服的办法来解决问题；自从贯彻执行了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的指示以后，大多数干部都同群众共甘苦同劳动，工作作风有了显著的转变；但由于对毛主席的指示理解得不够全面，对人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾分不清楚，又发生了对资本主义思想以及地主、富农反社会主义的言论放任自流不敢处理的现象。在这样情况下，大部分干部是硬着头皮干事，也有的畏难思退，准备秋后“换班”。这次各地召开三级干部会议的时候，到会干部一开始多反映下面工作越来越难办，叫苦叫屈，认为这期间挨了不少累，受了不少气，埋怨领导方面和政法部门不支持；有的更错误地认为这期间农村问题所以这样多，是由于“正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”所引起的。特别在城市反右派斗争开展以后，听到县里开会，就以为现在的方针要变了（意即不能再用说服教育方法正确处理人民内部矛盾了），准备来领回一个“新精神”（意即要恢复强迫命令），好回去“治人”，出出半年来所受的气。他们听了要通过鸣放辩论方法首先统一思想认识，然后研究回去如何搞好社会主义教育问题后，就认为这种搞法不能解决问题，产生了很大的抵触情绪。这就说明：如果不通过三级干部会议首先解决这部分人的思想问题，使他们明确认识社会主义教育的目的和意义，政策与做法，就很难保证在农村展开社会主义教育的时候不发生偏差。
    第二，前一个时期，在区乡社干部中间，除了多数社会主义立场坚定的以外，也有一部分干部在资本主义思想冲击之下，方向模糊，在合作化和粮食统购统销问题上发生动摇，有的有比较严重的右倾思想、本位主义思想、资本主义思想。如果不通过鸣放辩论首先批判他们的这些思想，提高他们的思想觉悟，就没有条件搞好对农民的社会主义教育。
    第三，大鸣大放大争的方式，对广大农村干部来说是生疏的，没有经验的，他们所习惯的是由领导干部做报告等老一套办法。先在三级干部会议上鸣放争辩，不仅可以比较深透地解决他们的思想问题，而且可以通过小会大会示范和亲身体会，使他们自觉地接受并学会运用鸣放争辩这一群众路线的工作方法。
    大鸣大争能够真正解决干部的思想问题
    在三级干部会议上，能不能运用鸣放争辩的方法来解决到会干部的思想问题呢？最初，各级领导干部对这一点还是没有把握的，主要是顾虑在城市反右派斗争形势的影响下，放不出什么东西来，又怕会议时间拖长影响当前生产。到会干部最初也确实存在不少顾虑。有的认为提了意见不管用，有的怕提了不正确的意见会被当成右派来斗。但是，事实证明，只要领导得好，并不是鸣放不起来的。办法是：首先由县委领导干部作动员报告，要大家帮助县委整风；并说明当前农村闹粮食闹合作社等问题很多，看法不一，大家可以把自己对这些问题的意见看法都提出来，对的可以有利于改进领导与工作，不对的经过领导争辩也可以提高自己的认识水平。然后对症下药，才能有效地解决农村各项问题。继即在小组中由领导骨干带头鸣放，对不正确的思想硬着头皮听，不要急于挑起争辩，更不要随便扣大帽子压回去。这样，就可以由提正面意见发展到大胆直言，由一般问题集中到中心问题上来。到了一定温度，有的人就说：“就是杀头枪毙，不当干部我也要说。”总观各地三级干部会上放出的主要问题，在粮食统购统销方面，主要是：“粮食的紧张情况，是统购统销带来的”，“国家买的粮食太多，对农民挖得太苦”，“口粮标准太低，不够吃”，“实行统购统销政策是官逼民反”，主张“宁抗一家（国家），不得罪千户（农民），在这个问题上千万别挨了农民的扁担”，等等。在合作化方面：有的认为“合作化冒进了，步子走得太快了”，有的根本否认合作化的优越性，认为“高级社不如初级社，初级社不如互助组，互助组不如单干户”，“合作社搞一年穷十年，再搞几年老百姓连糠菜都吃不上”，有的人主张走回头路，把高级社改为初级社，等等。上述这些错误的思想暴露以后，在小组会上采用摆事实讲道理回忆对比算账等办法，展开辩论，批判反驳。然后再同揭露出来的反社会主义分子和资本主义思想较严重的重点人物在大会上进行辩论。
    这样做了以后，凡是放得比较彻底的地方，思想问题也就解决得比较深透。有的干部在提高觉悟以后说：“过的是社会主义生活，存的是资本主义心思，用资本主义思想看社会主义越看越别扭。这一次心里亮堂了。”
    大鸣大争可以摸清农村和干部的很多情况
    三级干部会议开得好的地方，还可以使领导方面摸清几个底：
    一、粮食的底。过去一般都叫一年三百六十斤不够吃，这次大家说了真话，很多地方的口粮留量实际是超过三百六十斤的。即使是每人三百六十斤，只要省吃俭用，大小口匀着吃，绝大部分户是过得去的。据蒙阴等县的分析：60％的户够吃，30％的户有余，5％—10％的户不够吃。黄县半脱产干部六百八十五名，在觉悟提高以后，自报家中粮食实况：有余粮的五百十五户，占总户数的75.2％，有余粮八万九千多斤，每户平均一百七十四斤。够吃的一百零二户，占14.8％。缺粮的六十八户，占10％。今年夏季征购任务未完成，除了产量低于去年外，思想问题确实很大。昌乐县揭发，全县四千一百多个社，征购中有问题的二百六十八处。其中多分粮的六十六处，偷分粮的二十一处，提高折干率的五十一处，多留种子的一百处，匿藏小麦的三十处，这样共使国家少征购粮食六十多万斤。
    二、合作化的底。益都县合作化后第一年——1956年，粮食总产量达到三亿二千万多斤，比1955年增产23.9％。全县二百四十六处社，比较稳定的有一百一十五处，占46.7％，基本稳定的一百处，占40.6％，落后社三十一处，占12.7％。
    三、干部的底。据益都县的统计：到会一千三百四十三个干部当中，犯有贪污、隐瞒产量、对抗统购任务、搞粮食投机活动等错误者有10％—15％。临沂县到会干部八百八十二人，检讨扩大灾情、压低产量、多报人口、企图少交售征购任务的二百六十六人，占30.1％，检讨春季哄闹的九十二人，占10.4％，叫喊三百六十斤口粮不够吃的九十一人，占10.3％，搞粮食投机的五人，占0.5％，闹退社单干的十八人，占2％，包庇地主富农反革命分子的三人，占0.3％。
    总之，凡是认真开好三级干部会议的，都可以获得以下几个比较明显的效果：
    （1）批判了干部中的右倾思想，本位主义与资本主义，划清大是大非的界限，提高干部的思想觉悟；
    （2）认清当前农村的两条道路的斗争形势，提高干部开展社会主义教育的自觉性；
    （3）初步学会运用鸣放争辩的方法。这样，不仅有利于当前农村大辩论的开展，也为转变干部强迫命令作风打下较好的基础。
