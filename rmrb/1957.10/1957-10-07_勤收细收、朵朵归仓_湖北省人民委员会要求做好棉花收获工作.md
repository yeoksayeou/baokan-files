Harvest Diligently and Meticulously, Every Boll to the Granary
Hubei Provincial People's Committee Calls for Doing a Good Job in Cotton Harvesting

(Reported by this newspaper) The current season is the cotton harvesting season. Seizing the opportunity and doing a good job in harvesting is the last and important link to ensure a bumper cotton harvest this year. To this end, the Hubei Provincial People's Committee issued instructions on September 29 on conscientiously doing a good job in cotton harvesting. Excerpts are as follows:

According to a typical investigation of several regions last year, due to the rough harvesting work, such as not picking in time and not picking cleanly, the loss of ginned cotton was generally about three catties per mu. The province harvested approximately 200,000 to 300,000 dan less of ginned cotton. This year, all regions must conduct propaganda and education among the masses to mobilize them to consciously harvest the cotton well. Purchasing departments must earnestly implement the policy of higher prices for higher quality cotton in order to encourage cotton farmers to work actively in harvesting.

Strengthen technical guidance for cotton harvesting, and harvest diligently and meticulously to ensure every boll reaches the granary. In the past, many regions did not do this work well enough. Some only valued the "first bloom" and "good cotton," neglecting the "last bloom" and "withered yellow cotton," and some residual cotton was not picked clean from the boll shells, resulting in losses. Many regions have promoted the "five separation" method of separating, sun-drying, storing, ginning, and selling good and bad cotton, which has played a great role in improving the quality of cotton. This method can be promoted in various regions.

Agricultural cooperatives should rationally arrange labor and give full play to the role of semi-laborers. At present, some agricultural cooperatives are promoting good methods such as contracting to individual households and continuous operation, as well as establishing a cotton harvesting inspection and acceptance system. Various regions can study and promote these methods. In addition, all regions must vigorously strengthen fire prevention and the control of cotton bollworms.

    勤收细收、朵朵归仓
    湖北省人民委员会要求做好棉花收获工作
    本报讯　目前正是棉花收获季节。掌握时机，做好收获工作，是保证今年棉花丰收的最后的一个重要环节。为此，湖北省人民委员会于9月29日发布了关于切实做好棉花收获工作的指示。兹摘要如下：
    根据去年若干地区的典型调查，由于收花工作做得粗糙，如没有及时摘、摘得不净，一般每亩损失皮棉三斤左右。全省约少收皮棉二十至三十万担。今年各地必须向群众进行宣传教育，发动群众自觉地收好棉花。收购部门必须认真执行优棉优价政策，以鼓励棉农作好收获工作的积极性。
    加强棉花收获工作的技术指导，要勤收细收，做到朵朵归仓。不少地区过去对这一工作做得不够好，有的只重视“头花”、“好花”，忽视“尾花”、“僵黄花”，并且铃壳内还残存一些棉花没有捡净，以致造成损失。许多地区推行了好、坏花分收、分晒、分存、分轧、分售的五分办法，对于提高棉花品级作用很大，各地可以推广。
    农业社要合理安排劳力，充分发挥半劳动力的作用。目前有些农业社推行分户包干、连续作业的方法和建立收花检查验收制度的经验很好，各地可以研究推广。此外，各地必须大力加强防火和防治红铃虫的工作。
