The fertile land of Ukraine

When people talk about Ukraine, you think of its vast fertile land, the quiet Dnieper River, the picturesque Crimea, and the important coal capital – Donbas.

The forty years since the October Revolution have completely changed the face of Ukraine. Today, Ukraine can be considered one of the strong countries in Europe in terms of area, population, and important industrial and agricultural products. It produces 130 million tons of coal annually, accounting for one-third of the total coal production of the Soviet Union. In addition to the famous Donbas, the mining volume of the new Lviv-Volyn coal region is also increasing day by day. Ukraine is also the oldest steel base in the Soviet Union, with very rich iron and manganese ore deposits. This year, its steel production will reach 20 million tons, and pig iron will reach 19 million tons. Ukraine's pig iron production has already exceeded that of any capitalist country in Europe. The machines produced in Kharkiv are also famous throughout the Soviet Union and abroad.

Twenty-five years ago, the largest hydroelectric power station at that time was built on the Dnieper River, which crosses Ukraine. This was the first child of the Soviet Union's first five-year plan. It was very difficult to build such a large project in the 1930s. The great Soviet writer Gorky said in his congratulatory letter to the workers when the power station was completed: "When the idea of building the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station emerged, some skeptics, pessimists, and enemies of the proletariat ridiculed each other, comforting themselves by saying: 'The Bolsheviks can't do anything! They can't overcome the power of the Dnieper River!' But they overcame it! They did it! The Dnieper River has been conquered and will henceforth serve the cause of developing socialist culture." Under the Soviet regime, this great river has become even more beautiful. In addition to the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station and the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station that have already been built on it, four large hydroelectric power stations will be built in Kremenchuk, Dneprodzerzhinsk, Kanev, and Kyiv.

Ukraine is one of the Soviet Union's important granaries, and its wheat is world-renowned. The area sown with sugar beets reaches more than 1.2 million hectares, which is more than the total sugar beet sowing area of ​​the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy combined. Ukraine's sugar beets can produce more than 3 million tons of sugar annually. Rich Ukraine has many large-scale modern agriculture. The collective farmers' lives are very prosperous. The scene described by the great Ukrainian poet Shevchenko, where the clothes worn by farmers before the revolution were darker than the black soil, has long become a distant past. Now, Ukraine's sugar production averages more than 60 kilograms per person, milk 295 kilograms, and meat 37 kilograms, which greatly exceeds the level of the United Kingdom.

The Crimean Peninsula in southern Ukraine is one of the largest sanatorium areas in the Soviet Union. It is surrounded by the sea on three sides and has beautiful scenery, attracting tens of thousands of tourists every year. There are thousands of sanatoriums and health resorts on the east coast, and Yalta is the most famous resort. The port of Sevastopol on the west coast is a world-famous heroic city.

The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, is a city with an ancient culture and is known as the "Mother of Russian Cities." Many ancient relics from the time of Kievan Rus' are preserved here. It was frantically destroyed by fascist troops during the Soviet Patriotic War, and the main streets were completely reduced to ashes. However, the heroic Soviet people quickly restored it after the war. Today, Kyiv, with a population of nearly one million, is not only the political and cultural center of Ukraine, but also has a highly developed light industry. (Chang) (with picture)

    沃土千里的乌克兰
    当人们讲到乌克兰时，你就会想到那辽阔的肥田沃土，静静的第聂伯河，风光秀丽的克里米亚，和那重要的乌金之都——顿巴斯。
    十月革命以来的四十年彻底改变了乌克兰的面目。今天的乌克兰按面积、人口和重要的工农业产品来说，可算作是欧洲的强国之一。它每年生产一亿三千万吨煤，占苏联煤产总量的三分之一。除去著名的顿巴斯以外，新的里沃夫—沃棱斯基煤区的开采量也正在一天天增加。乌克兰还是苏联最老的一个钢铁基地，拥有非常丰富的铁矿和锰矿。今年它的钢产量将达二千万吨，生铁将达一千九百万吨。乌克兰的生铁产量已经超过欧洲任何一个资本主义国家了。哈尔科夫出产的机器也是闻名全苏和国外的。
    二十五年前，在横贯乌克兰的第聂伯河上建立起了当时世界上最大的水力发电站，这是苏联第一个五年计划的初生子。在三十年代建设这样一个大工程是非常困难的。苏联文学大师高尔基在电站建成时给工人们的贺信里说：“当出现了建设第聂伯水电站的想法时，一些怀疑主义者、悲观主义者和无产阶级的敌人讥笑地彼此安慰着说：‘布尔什维克什么也做不出来！第聂伯河的力量是他们克服不了的！’但是克服了！做出来了！第聂伯河被战胜了，并从此起将为发展社会主义文化的事业服务。”这条大河在苏维埃政权下，已变得更加美丽了。在它上面除已建成的第聂伯水电站和卡霍夫卡水电站外，还将在克列门楚克、第聂伯捷任斯克、卡涅夫、基辅等地建设四个大水电站。
    乌克兰是苏联重要的谷仓之一，这里的麦子驰名世界。甜菜的播种面积达到一百二十多万公顷，这比英、美、法、意四国所有的甜菜播种面积还多。用乌克兰的甜菜每年可以生产出三百多万吨糖。富饶的乌克兰拥有许多大规模的现代化农业。集体农民的生活非常富裕。乌克兰大诗人舍甫钦科所描写的，革命前农民穿的衣服比黑土还黑的情景，早已成为遥远的过去了。现在乌克兰的糖产量平均每人六十多公斤，牛奶二百九十五公斤，肉类三十七公斤，大大超过了英国的水平。
    乌克兰南方的克里米亚半岛是苏联最大的疗养区之一，这里三面环海，风景秀丽，每年吸引着千万的游人。东海岸上有数以千计的休养所和疗养院，雅尔达是其中最著名的疗养地。西海岸上的塞瓦斯托波尔港是一座世界知名的英雄城市。
    乌克兰首都基辅是一座有着古老文化的城市，有“俄罗斯城市之母”的称号。在这里保存着许多基辅罗斯时的古迹。它在苏联卫国战争时受到了法西斯军队的疯狂破坏，主要的街道完全化为灰烬。但是英雄的苏联人民在战后很快地把它恢复了起来。今天的这座拥有近百万人口的基辅，不但是乌克兰的政治、文化中心，并且有着极为发展的轻工业。　　　　　　　　　（昌）（附图片）
