    Moscow, October 26th (Dispatch from our newspaper) To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Chinese broadcast program of Moscow Radio organized a prize-winning quiz contest for Chinese listeners starting in May of this year. The results of the competition have now been announced. A grand lottery and award ceremony was held at Moscow Radio on the evening of the 25th.
    Over the past six months, Moscow Radio has posed twenty-one questions related to Soviet history and construction to Chinese listeners in ten Chinese broadcast programs. During this period, 150,000 letters containing answers were sent from all over China. In addition to answering the questions, many people expressed their love for the Soviet Union in their letters. All these letters were carefully reviewed, and as a result, more than 5,900 listeners answered all the questions correctly.
    The lottery results are as follows: A total of eight people won radios: Zhao Guorui, Gao Zhaoming, Li Chaoyang, Zong Sen, Sun Changming, Liang Weiwu, Liu Xuezhi, and Gao Jingqin. Two people won cameras: Yang Su and Li Shijie. Four people won watches: Li Linze, Hao Zhaozhi, Sheng Baichuan, and Shi Fenglan. Those who did not win in the lottery will receive a beautifully crafted Lenin commemorative badge and a postcard commemorating the October Revolution.
    Zhang Yingwu, Cultural Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, attended the meeting and accepted the awards on behalf of the winners. These prizes will be handed over to the All-China Soviet Friendship Association to be forwarded to the winners.
    At the award ceremony, veteran Bolsheviks and Soviet experts who participated in the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge gave reports on Sino-Soviet friendship.
