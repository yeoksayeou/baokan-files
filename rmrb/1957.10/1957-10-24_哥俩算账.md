    Without a flashlight, the cooperative director Yang Cai stumbled home, one step high and one step low. He felt stuffy all over, his ears ringing. With a "bang," he pushed open the door. Without even lighting a lamp, he groped around for a basin of water and used a towel to splash it on his face and neck, making the pots and pans clang.
    "What's wrong with you?" His careful wife woke up and sensed something was wrong with her husband. She poked half her body out of the mosquito net and struck a match.
    Yang Cai didn't say anything, but pulled over a short stool and sat down. What was wrong with himself? Work cadre Lao Deng said he got discouraged after losing one debate, but he didn't admit it! But it was true that he was full of pent-up anger. Look, the cooperative cadres were all complaining about him: "If you want to win the debate, you have to get through to your elder brother first!" Alas! What kind of devilish ideas did his elder brother have? Why was this honest man always speaking up for the rich middle peasants, and cursing the cooperative even more fiercely than the rich middle peasants?
    "Why aren't you sleeping? Are you made of iron? Sitting there in the middle of the night, acting crazy!" His wife scolded him kindly.
      "What do you know!" Yang Cai retorted irritably. Instead of heading towards the bed, he walked towards the door. By the time his wife loudly asked him where he was going, he had already crossed the alley and was knocking on his elder brother's door across the street.
    His elder brother, Yang Wenzhuang, had just returned from the debate and was very pleased with himself. He hadn't gone to sleep yet. He was surprised to see his younger brother visiting so late at night.
      "You...?" His elder brother widened his eyes.
    "I want to talk to you," Yang Cai said.
    In order not to disturb the women and children, the brothers sat down by the doorstep. How should he start? Yang Cai rubbed the cigarette for a long time. He suddenly remembered Lao Deng's words that he usually said his "working methods were too rigid," so he regretted knocking on his elder brother's door in the middle of the night to talk. His elder brother spoke first: "You... don't say your elder brother's guts are straight to his butt. Look, everyone is complaining about reduced income and wants to divide up the land for individual contracts. Your elder brother is straightforward, and just said a few more words at the meeting to remind you cadres!"
    "Humph! 'Everyone'! Do you know which 'everyone' you represent?"
    His elder brother felt a surge of heat rushing to his head. He was most annoyed when this younger brother, more than ten years his junior, lectured him in person.
      "Which 'everyone' do I represent? I myself have reduced income!"
    "How have you reduced income?"
      "You're the cooperative director, don't you know? Tell me, how much money did the cooperative give me last year?"
    Yang Cai flipped through his notebook and said, "Four hundred and twenty-seven yuan!"
      "That's right, only four hundred and twenty-seven yuan! The year I worked individually, I sold fish from the fish farm alone for over five hundred yuan, plus the income from two mu of paddy fields and a piece of land! If you don't believe me, look at these fish sales receipts!"
    As he spoke, his elder brother walked to the incense table and pulled out a stack of receipts from under the candlestick.
    It was no use talking any further. Yang Cai didn't want to look at those messy receipts. He stood up, ready to leave. To think that his own elder brother, such a man who had turned his life around, since the fish farm was even allocated to him, had forgotten his roots! Yang Cai was both angry and frustrated, his heart as heavy as a lead weight. He inadvertently looked at the empty, simple house, and suddenly remembered something. He sat down again and, lowering his voice, kindly asked his elder brother:
    "You don't have a fishing net, do you?"
    "No! Is there a need to even ask?"
    "Then how do you 'scrape' for fish?"
      "I have to rent a net. Don't you know that?"
      "Do you know how to use a dragnet?"
    "I still have to ask someone to help."
      "How much are the wages?"
    "I haven't decided on a fixed amount. Anyway, I always ask Luo Gui Rong and those few households who are used to raising fish to come. For a day's work, they eat two meals, go to a restaurant, get one yuan for labor, and also take away a big fish!"
      "Oh—!" Yang Cai nodded as if he had discovered a miracle, and asked: "For your fish farm, can you raise fish fry (three or four inch long fish seedlings) yourself?"
      "Hey! Isn't that still relying on Luo Gui Rong and them to give me a little!"
    Yang Cai was certain in his mind. So he pulled over a small table and began to calculate the costs of net rental, fishing labor, handling fees, fish fry, feed... with his elder brother in detail.
      "Expenditure of two hundred and eighty yuan!" Yang Cai tore off the page on which he had written in his notebook and handed it to his elder brother. "Plus your two mu of paddy fields, the net income is only about three hundred yuan. Your piece of dry land is now a private plot, and the income is the same before and after joining the commune, so there's no need to calculate it. Calculated this way, your income increased by more than one hundred yuan!"
    His elder brother didn't say anything, but stared blankly at the piece of paper for a long time, then scratched his head and mumbled:
      "I didn't think of calculating these accounts before!"
    Yang Cai took a deep breath. He leaned forward and quietly asked his elder brother:
      "How did you think of digging out that stack of fish sales receipts?"
    His elder brother mumbled a bit more sheepishly:
      "Luo Gui Rong said to check the fish sales receipts and you would know that income decreased."
      "But he didn't tell you to calculate the cost expenditure?"
      "No." His elder brother shook his head awkwardly.
      "What an 'straight to his butt' man!" Yang Cai smiled wryly, then frowned and asked again: "Was it you who thought of telling the 'nine great benefits' of dividing up the land for individual contracts at the meeting?"
    "Luo Gui Rong said that the two of us should take the lead in saying it! But he slipped away after I finished speaking!"
    Yang Cai smiled wryly again: "What a 'straight to his butt' man!"
    The sound of a rooster crowing came from afar.
    "You! Think about it first, and let's talk in detail tomorrow!" Yang Cai said as he walked out the door. His elder brother stared blankly at the paper full of numbers again.
    Yang Cai jumped out of the door in a few steps, and suddenly bumped into someone by the door. Who was it? Yang Cai was about to question, but on closer inspection, it turned out to be his wife.
    "Why aren't you sleeping?"
    His wife didn't answer him, but whispered fiercely: "We must investigate the rich middle peasant Luo Gui Rong... so many tricks!"
    Yang Cai nodded, happily grabbing his wife's arm:
      "You fellow, not even sleeping, eavesdropping on people's conversations!"
    His wife quickly pushed away her husband's hand:
      "In the street! Don't hold hands and feet, putting on a show for people to see!"
      "What are you afraid of! Isn't it good to enlighten them!"
    The two young people laughed and ran into the house.
    The sound of roosters crowing rose and fell, and the dull night was about to pass.

    哥俩算账
    杨智维
    没有电筒，社主任杨才踉踉跄跄，一步高一步低摸回家来。他觉得满身闷热，两耳嗡嗡地响。“碰”的一声推开门，也不点个灯，摸黑舀了一盆水，用手巾蘸着满脸满颈地淋起来，把缸缸盆盆弄得叮当响。
    “你怎么啦？”细心的妻子醒转来就觉得丈夫有点异样，从蚊帐里探出半截身来，擦亮了火柴。
    杨才没有吱声，拉过一张矮凳坐下来。自己是怎么啦？工作干部老邓说自己辩论一次辩输了就丧气，自己才不承认呢！可是有满肚子闷气倒是真的。你看，社干部们都埋怨自己：“想辩胜人家，你先去弄通你大哥罢！”唉！大哥又不知是些什么鬼主意，他这个老实人为什么净替富裕中农说话，骂起合作社来比富裕中农还凶呢？
    “怎么不睡呀，铁打的么？半夜三更还呆在那儿发神经！”妻子好心地骂起来。
      “你懂什么！”杨才没好气地顶她一句，站起来，不是朝床跟前走来，却朝门口走去，等到妻子大声问他去哪里时，他已经穿过小巷，在对门他大哥门口敲门了。
    刚从辩论会归来的大哥杨文壮得意得很，还没有睡。看到深夜来访的弟弟感到很突然。
      “你……？”大哥瞪大了双眼。
    “找你谈谈。”杨才说。
    为了不惊动妇女和孩子们，兄弟俩在门槛边坐下来。话该怎样开头呢？杨才把烟卷搓了好半天，忽然想起老邓平时说自己“工作方法太生硬”的话，于是后悔不该半夜敲门找大哥谈话了。倒是大哥先开口：“你……别说你大哥一条肠通到屁股，你看，人家户户都吵减少收入，要分户包产，你大哥直性子，在会上就多说了几句，提醒你们干部！”
    “哼！‘人家’！你知道你代表了哪个‘人家’？”
    大哥觉得一股热流从胸口直涌上头来，他最恼怒这个比他小十多岁的年青的弟弟当面教训自己。
      “我代表哪个人家？我自己就减少了收入！”
    “你怎么减少了收入？”
      “你当社主任的还不知道？你说说去年合作社给我分过多少钱！”
    杨才翻了翻笔记本，说：“四百二十七块！”
      “可不是，才四百二十七块！我单干那年光是渔场养的鱼就卖了五百零几，还有两亩田一块地的收入呢？你不信你瞧瞧这些卖鱼发票！”
    大哥说着，走到香案边抽出压在烛台下的一叠发票来。
    话不投机半句多，杨才无心看那些乱七八糟的发票，站起来准备走了，眼看自己的亲哥哥这么一个翻身户，像渔场还是分来的呢，如今也忘本了！杨才又气又闷，心里像塞了一个秤锤那么沉重。他无意中看了看空空的简陋的房子，猛地想起了什么，又坐下来，放低喉咙，好声好气地问大哥：
    “你没有鱼罟网？”
    “没有！这还用问。”
    “那你怎么‘刮’鱼？”
      “要去租网。这你还不知道。”
      “你懂得使罟网？”
    “这还不是得请人帮忙。”
      “多少工钱？”
    “也没定准多少工钱，反正都是求罗桂荣他们养惯鱼的几户人来，干一天活吃两顿饭，上一趟酒楼，给一块钱人工，还拿走一条大鱼！”
      “哦——！”杨才像发现了奇迹似地点着头，又问：“你一个渔场，自己能养到鱼格（三四寸长的鱼苗）吗？”
      “咳！这还不是靠人家罗桂荣他们让一点！”
    杨才心里有准了，于是拉过一张小桌，跟大哥一五一十算起罟网租、捕鱼工、搬运费、鱼种、饲料……的成本来。
      “支出二百八十块！”杨才把写在笔记本上的那页纸撕下来，递到大哥面前。“加上你那两亩稻田，纯收入才不过三百块左右。你那块旱地现在是自留地，入社前后收入都一样，就不用算了。这样算起来，你增加收入一百块以上哪！”
    大哥没有吱声，把那片纸头呆呆看了老半天，然后搔搔脑袋，咧咧嘴唇说：
      “这些账，我先前没想起算！”
    杨才深深地吐了一口气，他靠前一步悄声问大哥：
      “你怎么会想起翻出那叠卖鱼发票？”
    大哥不好意思地又咧咧嘴说：
      “人家罗桂荣说查查卖鱼单据就知道减少收入了。”
      “可是他没有叫你算成本支出？”
      “没有。”大哥尴尬地摇摇头。
      “好一个‘一条肠通到屁股的人哪’！”杨才闪过一丝苦笑，又皱起眉来，再问：“是你想出要在大会上讲分户包产的‘九大好处’？”
    “罗桂荣说咱们两个人一起带头说罢！可是我讲完他就溜走了！”
    杨才又苦笑起来：“好一个‘一条肠通到屁股的人’哪！”
    远处传来一声鸡啼。
    “你呀！先想想，咱们明天再详细谈！”杨才说着走出门来。大哥又呆呆地看那张写满数字的纸头。
    杨才三步两步跳出门来，在门边蓦地碰到一个人，谁？杨才正想喝问，定睛一看原来是自己的妻子。
    “怎么你不睡？”
    妻子不答他，却悄声狠狠地说：“得追问富裕中农罗桂荣……这么多诡计！”
    杨才点着头，高兴地捉住妻子的臂膀：
      “你这家伙，连觉也不睡，偷听人家谈话！”
    妻子连忙推开丈夫的手：
      “在大街上哪！别拉手拉脚，做戏给人看！”
      “怕什么！给他们开通开通风气不好吗！”
    两个青年人笑着跑进家门。
    鸡啼声此起彼落，沉闷的黑夜就快要过去了。
