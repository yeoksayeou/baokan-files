Hunan Provincial Organs Enter Rectification Phase
　　Provincial Party Committee Submits Several Reform Plans, Including Those Related to Welfare Work, to the Masses for Discussion

Changsha Dispatch: Of the one hundred and forty-eight units directly under the Hunan Provincial level that have launched the rectification movement, one hundred have achieved a decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle and have begun or are about to enter the phase focusing on rectification and reform. A small number of advanced units have initially formed a surge of continued extensive airing of views and simultaneous rectification and reform.

During the anti-Rightist struggle phase, many units adhered to the policy of simultaneous rectification and reform, categorizing and prioritizing the opinions expressed by the masses and formulating improvement plans. As of the end of September, according to statistics from six systems, including Party and mass affairs, political and legal affairs, and rural water conservancy, of the 9,904 correct opinions raised by the masses, 3,142 have been adopted and improved upon. Among them, the issues resolved by the Party and mass affairs and rural water conservancy systems account for more than half of the issues raised by the masses.

Before entering the phase focusing on rectification and reform, the Water Conservancy Department had already adjusted employee dormitories, cancelled unreasonable welfare subsidies, and made many efforts in abolishing sections below the department and office level, streamlining the organization, and improving leadership style, based on the opinions raised by the masses. At the mobilization report meeting for entering the phase focusing on rectification and reform, the department's rectification leadership team once again sought everyone's opinions on the improvements made in the previous stage based on the opinions raised by the masses. For those that had not been improved, specific plans for future improvement were proposed for discussion by the masses, encouraging everyone's confidence in continuing to air their views. Within two days after the mobilization report, the masses posted thirty-six big-character posters, continuing to raise many suggestions for improvement on issues such as water conservancy business, administrative work of the organs, the welfare of cadres, and the work of the trade union.

At the Standing Committee meeting held on October 17, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee conducted a specific discussion on the rectification and reform work and decided to submit several reform plans, including those related to welfare work, to the masses of the provincial-level organs that are about to enter the rectification and reform phase for discussion, to listen to the opinions of the masses, and then to revise and implement them. On October 19, the Provincial Party Committee also convened a meeting of the Party group secretaries of various departments and bureaus, focusing on arranging the work related to the rectification and reform phase.

    湖南省级机关转入整改阶段
    省委将有关福利工作等几个改革方案提交群众讨论
    本报长沙22日电　湖南省级直属机关开展整风运动的一百四十八个单位，已经有一百个单位取得了反右派斗争的决定性胜利，开始转入或即将转入以整改为主的阶段，少数先进单位已初步形成了继续大鸣大放和边整边改的热潮。
    在反右派斗争阶段中，许多单位都坚持了边整边改的方针，将群众的鸣放意见分类排队，订出了改进方案。截至9月底止，根据党群、政法、农村水利等六个系统的统计，在群众所提的九千九百零四条正确意见中，已经被采纳并作了改进的有三千一百四十二条。其中党群、农村水利系统已经解决的问题，占群众提出的问题一半以上。
    水利厅在转入以整改为主的阶段以前，根据群众提出的意见，已经调整了职工宿舍，取消了不合理的福利补助，并在撤消厅、处以下科室、精简机构、改进领导作风等方面作了许多工作。在转入以整改为主的动员报告会上，厅的整风领导小组又将前一阶段群众提出的意见中已经改进的再一次征求大家意见，对未改进的，提出今后具体改进的方案交群众讨论，鼓舞了大家继续鸣放的信心。在动员报告以后两天内，群众即贴出了三十六张大字报，继续对水利业务、机关行政工作、干部的生活福利、工会工作等问题提出了许多改进意见。
    中共湖南省委在10月17日召开的常委会会议上，对整改工作作了具体讨论，并决定将有关福利工作等几个改革方案提交即将转入整改阶段的省级机关群众讨论，听取群众意见，然后加以修改实施。10月19日省委又召开了各厅局党组书记会议，着重布置了有关整改阶段的工作。
