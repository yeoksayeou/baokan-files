    The October Revolution Opened the Road to Thoroughly Solving the Nationalities Problem
    Liu Geping

    (I)
    The great October Socialist Revolution is forty years old. The people of all nationalities in our country are celebrating this greatest festival in human history with boundless excitement.
    The October Revolution opened a new era in human history, the new era of the collapse of imperialism and the victory of socialism. The great contribution of the Soviet people was to use revolutionary initiative to break through the chains of imperialist rule on one-sixth of the world's land, and to establish the first proletarian dictatorship of the socialist state in human history. In this country, the social roots of all exploitation and oppression were eliminated, the original Tsarist Russia's colonial rule over all ethnic groups within the country was abolished, and all ethnic groups formed a close and friendly Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the principles of equality and voluntariness. This set an example for the world's proletariat and oppressed nations in their struggle for social and national liberation.
    In the past forty years, the Soviet Union has achieved brilliant achievements in socialist and communist construction. Socialist Soviet Union has developed its economy, culture, and science and technology at a speed that capitalist countries could not dream of. In a short period of forty years, the Soviet Union has rapidly caught up with and surpassed the development level of many capitalist countries, becoming one of the most powerful industrial countries in the world, and at the same time possessing the world's largest and most mechanized advanced agriculture. Recently, the Soviet Union successfully launched an earth satellite immediately after the successful trial production of a ballistic rocket, indicating that the development level of Soviet science and technology has surpassed the United States and ranks first in the world. The great achievements of Soviet construction vividly demonstrate the incomparable superiority of the socialist system.
    In the process of revolution and construction, the Soviet Union has victoriously resolved the national question and the question of cooperation between nationalities. The successful resolution of this complex problem in the history of social development, the prosperity of socialist nationalities, and the continuous strengthening and consolidation of friendly relations between nationalities are important manifestations of the superiority of the socialist system, and prove that the Marxist-Leninist theory on the national question is completely correct.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches us that national oppression is the result of the class antagonism inherent in the capitalist system. The phenomenon of one nation oppressing another is incompatible with the essence of proletarian internationalism. "If private ownership and capital are bound to separate people, ignite national strife, and strengthen national oppression, then collective ownership and labor are bound to bring people closer, destroy national strife, and eliminate national oppression." (Resolution of the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party: On the Urgent Tasks of the Party on the National Question) Therefore, the victory of the October Revolution and the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship are the basis for the solution of the national question in the Soviet Union.
    The fraternal cooperative relationship formed by the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union within a unified state alliance has opened up broad prospects for the strength and consolidation of the Soviet Union and for the economic and cultural upsurge and prosperity of every nation in the Soviet Union. The great significance of the Soviet Union in resolving the national question lies not only in realizing the equality of all nationalities in legal rights and politics, but also in eliminating the de facto inequality of all nationalities left over by the old system. The socialist system has stimulated the enthusiasm and initiative of the people of all nationalities, enabling them to work hard for the strength of the motherland, the prosperity of the nation, and the happy life of everyone. The Russian working class and the Russian nation have done a lot of work in helping the formerly oppressed nations overcome their economic and cultural backwardness, helping them develop their socialist industry, training their own cadres, skilled workers, and intellectuals, etc., so that they can quickly improve to the same level as the Russian nation and achieve de facto equality.
    In the Soviet Union, among the non-Russian nationalities, which account for more than half of the total population, except for nationalities such as Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Estonia, and Latvia that have undergone the development of industrial capitalism, there are about 25 million people who have not had time to go through the stage of industrial capitalism; in addition, more than 6 million people still lived under patriarchal and clan systems before the socialist revolution; many nationalities did not have their own written language. Now, under the leadership and support of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet regime, these nationalities have, through their own efforts and with the help of advanced nationalities, rapidly developed their politics, economy, and culture, and together with the Russian nation, have built a socialist society and are transitioning to a communist society, developing into socialist nations.
    The reason why all nationalities in the Soviet Union were able to quickly eliminate the de facto inequality left over by the old system is inseparable from the constant care and consideration of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet regime for the needs of all nationalities. The economic and cultural undertakings of the entire Soviet Union are developing at an astonishing speed, and the development of the frontier nationalities is even more rapid. For example, comparing the industrial output in 1957 with that in 1913, the entire Soviet Union increased by 33 times, while the Kazakh Republic increased by 36 times, Kyrgyzstan increased by 42 times, and the Tajik Republic could produce its industrial products for the entire year of 1928 in two and a half days in 1956. Agriculture and animal husbandry in various national republics have achieved rapid development. For example, in the Kazakh Republic, due to large-scale land reclamation in recent years, the cultivated area has increased from 4.2 million hectares in 1913 to 27.8 million hectares in 1956. The grain harvested in 1956 reached 1.4 billion poods. From 1934 to 1954, the number of cattle increased by two times. Sheep and goats increased by 8 times, and pigs and horses increased by 3.5 times.
    While developing economically, all nationalities in the Soviet Union have realized a cultural revolution. The Soviet Union implemented a seven-year universal education system nationwide in 1949, and is now promoting a ten-year universal education system in the capitals of various republics, in the central cities of various provinces, and in industrial centers. The popularization of education has prepared the conditions for the improvement of culture. For example, the Kazakh Republic not only had no universities before the October Revolution, but even had no secondary schools. 98% of the residents were illiterate. Now, the Kazakh Republic has completely eliminated illiteracy, and there are about several thousand middle and primary schools and more than thirty universities. In 1956, the number of people working in scientific research institutions in Kazakhstan reached 1,060. Another example is the Turkmen Republic, where almost all residents were illiterate before the October Revolution. Now, not only has illiteracy been eliminated, but more than 7,000 people have a higher education.
    Obviously, the achievements of the Soviet Union in resolving the national question are very great. The Soviet experience proves that the socialist road is the road to the development and prosperity of all nationalities, and only by taking the socialist road can all nationalities be completely liberated and achieve de facto equality.

    (II)
    The October Socialist Revolution had a huge and profound impact on our country's revolutionary cause. The people of all nationalities in our country have won victory only after a long struggle along the road opened up by the October Revolution. The Chinese Communist Party has always believed that the Chinese revolution is a continuation of the great October Socialist Revolution, and takes this as its greatest glory.
    Learning from the Soviet Union's experience in building a multinational socialist country is of great significance for resolving our country's national question. After the Communist Party of the Soviet Union unprecedentedly solved the Soviet Union's national question, the Chinese Communist Party also achieved great achievements in solving China's national question, once again proving the invincible power of Marxist-Leninist theory on the national question.
    Our country is a multi-ethnic country composed of the Han nationality and dozens of minority nationalities. The national question is a long-standing and complex problem in our country. The vast territory of our motherland was jointly developed by all nationalities, and the long history and splendid culture of our motherland were jointly created by all nationalities. Because all nationalities have lived in one country for a long time, and many minority nationalities have long lived intermingled with the Han nationality, the economic ties and cultural exchanges between nationalities have gradually developed, forming an inseparable and close relationship. However, the status of all nationalities in our country has been unequal in history. For a long time, there has been a feudal centralized system in our country. Under this system, the ruling class in the nation occupying the ruling position of the country oppressed other nationalities. For a long period of history, the Han nationality occupied the ruling position of the country, and the ruling class in the Han nationality oppressed the minority nationalities; there were also times when a certain minority nationality occupied the ruling position of the country, and the ruling class among them oppressed the Han nationality and other minority nationalities. However, the latter situation occupied a relatively short period in history. The system of national oppression brought deep disasters and pain to the people of all nationalities, and caused hatred and struggle between nationalities.
    Imperialism's aggression against our country promoted the development of capitalism in our country, strengthened domestic national oppression, and deepened the disaster of the people of all nationalities. The feudal landlords, bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and imperialism combined to carry out more cruel exploitation and oppression against the minority nationalities in the country. The Kuomintang government, the last reactionary government in our country's history, was the representative of this bloody policy of national oppression. This government also cruelly oppressed and exploited the Han people. It was the common enemy of the people of all nationalities in our country.
    The purpose of imperialism in invading our country was to turn our country into their colony. Under the situation of increasingly deepening imperialist aggression, the Han nationality and all minority nationalities faced the danger of national subjugation. In order to achieve their goal of dividing or exclusively occupying our country, imperialism once used our country's national contradictions to carry out various conspiracies, provoke relations between our country's nationalities, cultivate separatists among minority nationalities, create so-called "autonomy" or "independence" in minority nationalities, and incite minority nationalities to separate from the motherland. These conspiracies have all suffered a shameful defeat.
    Imperialist aggression awakened the awakening of all nationalities in our country. In the past hundred years, not only has a revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudalism arisen among the Han nationality, but this struggle has also developed wave after wave among minority nationalities. However, before the October Revolution, the struggle of all nationalities in China against imperialism and feudalism, due to the lack of leadership of advanced classes and advanced political parties, and the revolutionary struggle in many minority nationalities was not closely integrated with the revolutionary struggle of the Han people, had to end in failure.
    The victory of the October Socialist Revolution illuminated the road forward for the people of all nationalities in our country. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped advanced elements throughout the world and also helped China's advanced elements to use the proletarian world view as a tool for observing the fate of the country and to reconsider their own problems. Follow the path of the Russians—this is the conclusion." ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship") Under the influence of the October Revolution, the Communist Party of China was established. Since then, the face of the Chinese revolution has been renewed, and it has begun to move from failure to victory. The Chinese national question has also found a solution.
    After its establishment, the Communist Party of China paid due attention to the national question in our country. The Party believes that the national question is an inseparable part of the Chinese revolution. In the first stage of the Chinese revolution, it is a part of our people's democratic revolution; in the second stage of the revolution, it is a part of the socialist revolution. Thoroughly liberating the people of all nationalities in our country is an unshirkable responsibility of the Chinese Communists. If the Chinese working class does not help the minority nationalities to be liberated, then it will be difficult, even impossible, to overthrow the rule of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism in China, and then to achieve the victory of the socialist revolution. At the same time, it is impossible for minority nationalities to seek liberation if they leave the general struggle of the Chinese revolution. During the period of the people's democratic revolution, the Chinese Communist Party carried out a lot of work in various minority nationalities, established Party organizations in many minority nationalities, cultivated communist cadres, and led the people of all nationalities throughout the country to fight for the elimination of national oppression, the realization of national equality, and the overthrow of the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Under the leadership of the Party, the Han people and the people of all minority nationalities formed a close fighting friendship in the revolutionary struggle, finally defeated the imperialism that invaded our country, overthrew the reactionary Kuomintang government, and established the People's Republic of China, forever eliminating the long-standing system of national oppression in our country and realizing national equality.
    The establishment of the People's Republic of China marked the complete victory of our people's democratic revolution and the beginning of the stage of socialist revolution. Since then, our country's task in the national question has been to lead and help all minority nationalities gradually transition to socialism.
    At the time of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party advocated adopting the policy of national regional autonomy as the basic policy of our country for resolving the national question. This proposition has been warmly supported by the people of all minority nationalities and the Han people throughout the country, and has been clearly recorded in our country's constitution. This proposition of the Chinese Communist Party is based on the common fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities throughout the country. National regional autonomy can not only realize the right of minority nationalities to be masters of their own affairs and develop their own politics, economy, and culture according to their own characteristics, but also unite all fraternal nationalities on an equal footing within a unified country to jointly build socialism. It is conducive to the strength and consolidation of the motherland, conducive to the close cooperation of the people of all nationalities, and conducive to the development and prosperity of all minority nationalities.
    Our Party's adoption of the policy of national regional autonomy in the domestic national question is based on the Marxist-Leninist theory on the national question combined with our country's historical development and actual situation. Lenin said: "Various countries differ due to differences in the speed of national development, the national composition of residents, the distribution of residents, etc. Without paying attention to all these general historical conditions and specific national conditions, it is fundamentally impossible to start formulating the national program of Marxists in that country." (Selected Works of Lenin, Two-Volume Edition, Volume 1, p. 827) According to Lenin's teaching, examining the history and current situation of all nationalities in our country, it can be seen that the national question in our country has the following three basic characteristics: First, it is a national question in a country that has developed from the struggle against colonialism and from the national liberation movement. Before liberation, our country was a colonial and semi-colonial country. There is a difference between the revolution in imperialist countries and the revolution in colonial and semi-colonial countries. Lenin said in his report on the national colonial question at the Second Congress of the Communist International: "What is the most important and fundamental idea of our outline? It is the difference between the oppressed nations and the oppressor nations." ("Lenin and Stalin on China," p. 91) These are two types of revolution, and the specific solutions to the national question in these two types of countries should also be different. In our country, due to the invasion of imperialism, it has become the biggest enemy of the people of all nationalities in our country. It has closely linked the fate of the people of all nationalities in our country. Only by uniting can all nationalities overthrow the oppression of imperialism. In the struggle against imperialism, especially in the development of the revolution led by the Communist Party of China based on rural areas, all nationalities have increasingly formed an inseparable relationship. Although the rule of imperialism in our country has been overthrown by us, it still occupies our country's territory of Taiwan, and is still carrying out conspiracies against all nationalities in our country at all times in an attempt to restore capitalism in China. Second, it is a national question in a country formed by the combination of all nationalities in the long historical development. Although there has been a system of national oppression in our country's history, and there have been countless wars and disputes between nationalities, the economic ties and cultural exchanges between nationalities have continued to develop. An interdependent and inseparable relationship has gradually been established between all nationalities. Third, it is a national question in a country composed of 570 million Han people and less than 40 million minority nationality people. In our country, although the Han nationality has a large population, the land it occupies only accounts for about 40% of the country's total area. Although the minority nationalities have a relatively small population, the land they occupy accounts for about 60%. Only through cooperation and mutual assistance can all nationalities develop together. Due to historical reasons, generally speaking, the Han nationality is more advanced in terms of political, economic, and cultural development, and therefore has a special obligation to help all minority nationalities.
    Starting from the above characteristics, it is completely appropriate to adopt the policy of national regional autonomy in our country to unite all nationalities within a unified unitary motherland and jointly strive for the construction of socialism. The result of implementing the policy of national regional autonomy in the past eight years proves that this policy is completely suitable for our country's situation and is a completely correct policy.
    Now, the people of all nationalities in our country are advancing along the socialist road. The people of all nationalities have realized from practical experience that the socialist road is the road to the complete liberation and common prosperity of all minority nationalities in our country. Only by taking the socialist road can the root of national oppression be fundamentally eliminated. The economic and cultural conditions of minority nationalities, which are generally more backward due to historical development, that is, the de facto inequality between nationalities, can only be resolved in the high development of the socialist economy. The Chinese Communist Party's leadership and assistance to all minority nationalities in transitioning to socialism is for the development of all minority nationalities. Feudalism and imperialism both weaken minority nationalities. Under the rule of feudalism and imperialism, the fate of minority nationalities can only be decline and demise. Socialism is to realize both national equality and unity, and to realize national prosperity. This is the fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism on the national question.
    The development of all minority nationalities in our country is very uneven. At the time of the founding of the People's Republic of China, many minority nationalities were still in the state of natural economy of feudal society; some nationalities still maintained the serf system and semi-serf system. A few minority nationalities were still under the slave system, and even some nationalities still maintained the primitive commune system. Of course, some nationalities have developed capitalism. Socialism cannot be established on these different social foundations. What we want to build is a unified socialist economy. Therefore, it is necessary to help all minority nationalities transition to socialism one after another from their current stage of development. This task of our Party is proposed based on Lenin's famous principle that backward nationalities, with the help of the proletariat of advanced nationalities, can avoid the stage of capitalist development, transition to socialism, and transition to communism after a certain stage of development. Lenin's principle has been fully proven in the Soviet Union, and the huge progress and development achieved by minority nationalities in our country on the socialist road also confirm the brilliance and correctness of Lenin's principle.
    In order to enable all nationalities to transition to socialist society, it is necessary to carry out necessary democratic reforms and socialist transformation of the original social and political systems of all minority nationalities. Regarding the democratic reforms and socialist transformation in minority nationalities, since "all nationalities have different historical conditions, it must not be assumed that all nationalities in the country will enter socialism at the same time and in the same way." The preamble to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "The state will take care of the needs of all nationalities in the process of economic construction and cultural construction, and will pay full attention to the characteristics of the development of all nationalities on the issue of socialist transformation." "That is to say, when to implement socialist transformation and how to implement socialist transformation will vary depending on the different development situations of all nationalities." (Liu Shaoqi: "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China") In some minority nationality areas, due to the special social development situation, the democratic reforms there are carried out by peaceful means, that is, not by forcing the exploiters to give up exploitation through forcible struggle, but by persuading them to give up exploitation through peaceful consultation and persuasion, while the state takes appropriate measures to maintain their lives.
    Now, among the more than 35 million minority nationality population in our country, the areas with a population of about 30 million have basically realized the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production. In the remaining areas, some are undergoing democratic reforms with the elimination of the manorial system and the slavery system as the basic goal. After this task is completed, socialist transformation will be carried out; in addition, a small number of minority nationality areas with very backward social development and extremely unclear class differentiation have also begun to carry out socialist transformation. This means that the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has achieved a basic victory in the vast majority of minority nationalities.
    In order to make all minority nationalities prosper and develop into socialist nationalities, in addition to carrying out social reforms, it is also necessary to develop socialist economic construction and socialist national culture in all ethnic minority areas. The fundamental key is to develop modern industry. During our country's first five-year plan period, the economy and culture of ethnic minority areas have developed to a certain extent, and some ethnic minority areas have developed greatly. According to recent statistics, by the end of 1956, the state had established 423 modern industries in ethnic minority areas. Many nationalities that had no industry before liberation now have industry and have their own working class. In 1956, the total industrial output value of national autonomous regions and autonomous prefectures nationwide was 1.7 billion yuan, 229.5% of that in 1952 and 426.6% of that in the early days of liberation; the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries was 4.4 billion yuan, 128.2% of that in 1952 and 217.2% of that in the early days of liberation; the total number of livestock was 78.466 million, 134.4% of that in 1952 and 168.2% of that in the early days of liberation. The development of economic construction has improved the material and cultural life of all nationalities. In 1956, the total number of students in universities, middle schools, and primary schools in various autonomous regions and autonomous prefectures reached 4.05 million, with an average of more than 1,000 students per 10,000 people; there were 13,268 hospital beds, 502% of that in the early days of liberation; and 5,101 doctors, 472% of that in the early days of liberation. Up to now, writing schemes have been formulated for 20 nationalities that previously had no written language, and some schemes have been tested and implemented. The economy and culture of various national autonomous counties have also developed to varying degrees.
    The progress of socialist transformation and socialist construction has fundamentally changed the face of the vast majority of minority nationalities in our country. The relations between all nationalities, on the basis of the continuous victory of socialist transformation among the Han nationality and the majority of minority nationalities, are more united and friendly, and the cooperation and mutual assistance between all nationalities have been strengthened. The achievements already obtained encourage the people of all nationalities in our country to advance confidently along the socialist road. (To be continued)

    十月革命开辟了彻底解决民族问题的道路
    刘格平
    （一）
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，四十周年了。我国各族人民怀着无限兴奋的心情，欢庆这个人类历史上最伟大的节日。
    十月革命，开辟了人类历史的新纪元，这就是帝国主义崩溃和社会主义胜利的新纪元。苏联人民的伟大贡献，就是用革命的首创精神，在世界六分之一的土地上，冲破了帝国主义统治的锁链，建立了人类历史上第一个无产阶级专政的社会主义国家。在这个国家里，消灭了一切剥削和压迫的社会根源，废除了原来沙皇俄国对境内各民族的殖民统治，使各民族在平等和自愿的原则下，结成了亲密友好的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟；从而为世界各国无产阶级和被压迫民族争取社会解放和民族解放的斗争，树立了走向胜利的榜样。
    四十年来，苏联在社会主义和共产主义的建设中，获得了辉煌的成就。社会主义的苏联，以资本主义国家梦想不到的速度，发展了自己的经济、文化和科学技术。在短短的四十年间，苏联迅速地赶上并且超过了许多资本主义国家的发展水平，成为世界上最强大的工业国之一，同时拥有世界上规模最大和机械化程度最高的先进农业。最近，苏联紧接着弹道火箭试制成功之后又成功地发射了地球卫星，表明苏联科学技术的发展水平，已经超过美国，跃居世界首位。苏联建设的伟大成就，鲜明地显示了社会主义制度有着无可比拟的优越性。
    在革命和建设的进程中，苏联胜利地解决了民族问题和各民族合作的问题。社会发展史上这个复杂问题的成功解决，社会主义民族的繁荣，各民族之间友谊关系的不断加强和巩固，是社会主义制度优越性的重大表现，证明了马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的理论完全正确。
    马克思列宁主义教导我们，民族压迫是资本主义制度固有的阶级对抗的结果。一个民族压迫另一个民族的现象，是和无产阶级国际主义的本质不相容的。“如果私有制和资本势必离散人们，燃起民族的纷争，加强民族的压迫，那末集体所有制和劳动就势必使人们接近，摧毁民族的纷争，消灭民族的压迫。”（俄共第十次代表大会决议：论党在民族问题方面的迫切任务）所以十月革命的胜利，无产阶级专政的确立，乃是苏联的民族问题得以解决的基础。
    苏联各族人民，在苏联共产党的领导下，在统一的国家联盟内形成的兄弟般的合作关系，为苏联的强大和巩固，为苏联每个民族经济文化的高涨和繁荣，开辟了广阔的前景。苏联解决民族问题的伟大意义，不仅在于实现了各民族在法权上政治上的平等，而且在于消灭了旧制度所遗留下来的各民族事实上的不平等。社会主义制度激发了各族人民的积极性和主动精神，使他们为祖国的强大、民族的繁荣和每个人都能过幸福生活进行了辛勤的劳动。俄罗斯工人阶级、俄罗斯民族，在帮助从前被压迫民族克服经济、文化上的落后状态方面，做了很多工作，帮助他们发展自己的社会主义工业，培养自己的干部、熟练工人和知识分子等等，从而使他们能够很快地提高到和俄罗斯民族相同的水平，达到了事实上的平等。
    在苏联，占总人口半数以上的非俄罗斯民族中，除过乌克兰、格鲁吉亚、阿尔明尼亚、爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚等民族曾经经过工业资本主义的发展以外，大约有两千五百多万人口，没有来得及经过工业资本主义的发展阶段；另外还有六百多万人口在社会主义革命前还生活在宗法制度和氏族制度的条件下；有好多民族没有自己的文字。现在，这些民族，都在苏联共产党、苏维埃政权的领导和支援下，经过自己的努力和先进民族的帮助，迅速地发展了自己的政治、经济和文化，和俄罗斯民族一道建成了社会主义社会，并且向共产主义社会过渡，发展成为社会主义民族。
    苏联各民族所以能够很快地消灭了旧制度遗留下来的事实上的不平等，是和苏联共产党、苏维埃政权对各民族的需要经常关怀和照顾分不开的。全苏联的经济文化事业是以惊人的速度向前发展着，边疆各民族的发展则更加迅速。例如：拿1957年的工业产量同1913年比较，全苏联增长为33倍，而哈萨克共和国却增长为36倍，吉尔吉斯增长为42倍，塔吉克共和国1956年在两天半的时间中，就可以生产出它在1928年全年的工业产品。各民族共和国的农业和畜牧业有了飞跃的发展。例如哈萨克共和国，由于最近几年的大规模垦荒，耕地面积从1913年的420万公顷，至1956年已经增加到2780万公顷。1956年收获的粮食即达14亿普特。从1934年到1954年，牛的头数增加了两倍。绵羊和山羊增加了8倍，猪和马增加了3、5倍。
    苏联各民族在经济发展的同时，实现了文化上的革命。苏联于1949年已经在全国实行了七年制普及教育，现在正在各共和国的首都，在各省的中心城市和工业中心推行十年制的普及教育。教育的普及为文化的提高准备了条件。例如哈萨克共和国，在十月革命前，不但没有高等学校，甚至没有中等学校。全国98％的居民是文盲。现在，哈萨克共和国完全没有文盲了，中、小学约有几千所，高等学校三十余所。1956年在哈萨克科学研究机关中工作的人员即达一千零六十人。又如土库曼共和国，在十月革命前，几乎全部居民都是文盲，现在不但消灭了文盲，并且有七千多人具有高等教育程度。
    很明显，苏联在解决民族问题方面取得的成就是十分巨大的。苏联的经验证明，社会主义道路是各民族发展和繁荣的道路，只有走社会主义道路各民族才能彻底解放，得到事实上的平等。
    （二）
    十月社会主义革命，对我国的革命事业发生了巨大和深刻的影响。我国各族人民正是沿着十月革命开辟的道路，经过长期奋斗才获得胜利的。中国共产党从来认为：中国革命是伟大十月社会主义革命的继续，并且以此为莫大的光荣。
    学习苏联建设多民族的社会主义国家的经验，对于解决我国的民族问题有着极大的重要意义。在苏联共产党史无前例地解决了苏联的民族问题以后，中国共产党也在解决中国的民族问题方面，获得了巨大的成就，又一次证明了马克思列宁主义关于民族问题理论的无往而不胜的巨大力量。
    我国是一个由汉族和几十个少数民族结合而成的多民族国家。民族问题，在我国是一个长期存在的复杂问题。我们祖国广大的疆土，是各民族共同开发的，我们祖国的悠久历史和灿烂文化是各民族共同创造的。由于各民族长期地生活在一个国家之内，许多少数民族并且长期地和汉族交错杂居，因而各民族间逐渐发展了经济上的联系和文化上的交流，形成了不可分离的密切关系。但是，在历史上我国各民族的地位是不平等的。很久以来我国就存在着封建的中央集权制度，在这种制度下，居于国家统治地位的民族中的统治阶级，压迫着其它各民族。在较长的历史时期内是汉族居于国家统治地位，汉族中的统治阶级压迫着少数民族；也有些时候，是某个少数民族居于国家统治地位，他们当中的统治阶级压迫着汉族和其他少数民族。不过，后一种情况在历史上所占的时期是比较短的。民族压迫制度给各族人民带来了深重的灾难和痛苦，引起了各民族间的仇视和斗争。
    帝国主义对我国的侵略，促进了我国资本主义的发展，加强了国内的民族压迫，加深了各族人民的灾难。封建地主、官僚资产阶级和帝国主义结合起来，对国内各少数民族，实行了更加残酷的剥削和压迫。我国历史上最后一个反动政府国民党政府，就是这种血腥的民族压迫政策的代表者。这个政府同时也残酷地压迫、剥削着汉族人民。他是我国各族人民的共同敌人。
    帝国主义侵略我国的目的，是要把我国变成他们的殖民地，在帝国主义侵略日益加深的形势下，汉族和所有的少数民族都面临着亡国的危险。帝国主义为了达到他们瓜分或者独占我国的目的，曾经利用我国的民族矛盾进行过种种阴谋活动，挑拨我国各民族的关系，培植少数民族中的分离主义分子，在少数民族中制造所谓“自治”或“独立”，煽动少数民族脱离祖国，这些阴谋都遭到了可耻的失败。
    帝国主义侵略唤起我国各民族的觉醒，百余年来不但在汉族中兴起了反对帝国主义和封建主义的革命斗争，在少数民族中这种斗争也此起彼伏地发展着。但是，在十月革命以前，中国各族人民反帝反封建的斗争，由于没有先进阶级和先进政党的领导，许多少数民族中的革命斗争还由于没有和汉族人民的革命斗争紧密结合起来，因而都不得不归于失败。
    十月社会主义革命的胜利，照亮了我国各族人民前进的道路。毛泽东同志说：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”（“论人民民主专政”）在十月革命的影响下，中国共产党成立了。从此以后，中国革命的面目为之一新，开始从失败走向胜利。中国的民族问题从而也找到解决的途径。
    中国共产党在他一经成立之后，就对我们国内的民族问题给予了应有的注意。党认为民族问题是中国革命问题不可分的一部分。在中国革命的第一阶段，它是我国人民民主革命的一部分；到了革命的第二个阶段，它是社会主义革命的一部分。彻底解放我国各族人民，是中国共产党人无可推卸的责任。中国工人阶级如果不帮助少数民族得到解放，那末推翻帝国主义、官僚资本主义和封建主义在中国的统治，进而取得社会主义革命的胜利是困难的，甚至是不可能的。同时，少数民族如果离开中国革命总的斗争，想求得解放也是不可能的。中国共产党在人民民主革命时期，在各少数民族中进行了许多工作，在许多少数民族中建立了党的组织，培养了共产主义干部，领导全国各族人民为消除民族压迫，实现民族平等，推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治而斗争。在党的领导下，汉族人民和各少数民族人民在革命斗争中结成了亲密的战斗友谊，终于战胜了侵略我国的帝国主义，推翻了反动的国民党政府，成立了中华人民共和国，永远消灭了长期存在于我国的民族压迫制度，实现了民族平等。
    中华人民共和国的成立标志着我国人民民主革命的彻底胜利和社会主义革命阶段的开始，从此以后，我国在民族问题方面的任务便是领导和帮助各少数民族逐渐过渡到社会主义。
    在中华人民共和国成立的时候，中国共产党主张采用民族区域自治政策，作为我国解决民族问题的基本政策。这一主张得到全国少数民族人民和汉族人民的热烈拥护，并且已经明确地记载在我国宪法上了。中国共产党的这个主张，是从全国各民族人民共同的根本的利益考虑的。民族区域自治既可以实现少数民族当家作主的权利，按照自己的特点来发展自己的政治、经济和文化，又可以在平等的基础上团结各兄弟民族在统一大国内，共同建设社会主义。它有利于祖国的强大和巩固，有利于各族人民的亲密合作，有利于各少数民族的发展和繁荣。
    我们党在国内民族问题方面采用民族区域自治政策，是根据马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的理论结合我国的历史发展和实际情况决定的。列宁说：“各个国家，因民族发展速度，居民民族成份，居民分布等等差异而各不相同。若不注意到所有这些一般历史条件和具体国家条件，就根本无法着手制定该国马克思主义者底民族纲领。”（列宁文选两卷集卷—827页）根据列宁的这个教导来考察我国各民族的历史和现状，可以看出我们国内的民族问题有以下三个基本特点：第一，它是在一个从反殖民主义的斗争中，从民族解放运动中发展起来的国家内的民族问题。在解放以前，我国是一个殖民地、半殖民地的国家。帝国主义国家的革命和殖民地、半殖民地国家的革命是有区别的，列宁在共产国际第二次代表大会上关于民族殖民地问题的报告中说：“我们提纲底最重要、最基本的思想是什么呢？就是被压迫民族与压迫民族之间的区别。”（“列宁、斯大林论中国”91页）这是两种类型的革命，在这两类国家中民族问题的具体解决办法，也应该有所不同。在我国，由于帝国主义的侵入，成为我国各民族人民的最大敌人，它把我国各族人民的命运密切地联系在一起了。各民族只有团结起来，才能推翻帝国主义的压迫。在反对帝国主义的斗争中，特别是在中国共产党领导下的以农村为根据地的革命发展中，各民族日益结成了血肉不可分离的关系。现在帝国主义在我国的统治虽然被我们推翻了，但是它还侵占着我国的领土台湾，并且还无时无刻地不在向我们各民族进行阴谋活动，以图在中国复辟。第二，它是在一个由各民族在长期的历史发展中结合而成的国家内的民族问题。在我国历史上尽管存在着民族压迫制度，民族间有过无数次的征战和纷争，但是各民族间的经济上的联系和文化上的交流，还是得到了不断的发展。各民族间已经逐渐建立了互相依赖的不可分离的关系。第三，它是在一个由五亿七千多万汉族人民和不到四千万少数民族人民组成的国家内的民族问题。在我们国内，汉族虽然人口多，但他居住的土地面积只约占全国总面积的40％，少数民族人口虽然比较少，但他居住的土地面积却约占60％。各民族只有合作互助，才能共同发展。由于历史的原因，一般的说，汉族在政治、经济、文化的发展都比较先进，因此有特别的义务去帮助各个少数民族。
    从以上的特点出发，在我国采用民族区域自治政策把各民族联合在一个统一的单一制的祖国大家庭内，共同为建设社会主义而奋斗，便是完全适当的。八年来，实现民族区域自治政策的结果，证明了这个政策是完全适合我国情况的，是完全正确的政策。
    现在，我国各族人民正沿着社会主义道路向前迈进。各族人民已经从实际经验中认识到社会主义道路是我国各少数民族彻底解放和共同繁荣的道路。只有走社会主义道路，才能从根本上消除民族压迫的根源。历史发展所造成的少数民族的经济文化一般比较落后的状况，即各民族间事实上的不平等，只有在社会主义经济的高度发展中才能解决。中国共产党领导和帮助各少数民族都过渡到社会主义，就是为了各少数民族的发展。封建主义和帝国主义都是削弱少数民族的，在封建主义和帝国主义的统治下，少数民族的命运只能是没落和衰亡。社会主义则是既要实现民族平等和团结，又要实现民族繁荣，这是马克思列宁主义在民族问题上的根本原则。
    我国各少数民族的发展是很不平衡的。在中华人民共和国成立的时候，许多少数民族还处在封建社会的自然经济状态中；有些民族还保持有农奴制度、半农奴制度。有个别少数民族还处在奴隶制度下，甚至有些民族还保有原始公社制度。当然也有的民族已发展了资本主义。社会主义不可能在这种种不同的社会基础上建立起来，我们要建立的是一个统一的社会主义经济。因此必须帮助各个少数民族从他们现有的发展阶段上都先后过渡到社会主义。我们党的这个任务，是根据列宁关于落后民族在先进民族的无产阶级帮助之下，可以避免资本主义的发展阶段，过渡到社会主义，并且经过一定的发展阶段，过渡到共产主义的著名原理提出的。列宁的这个原理，在苏联已经得到了充分的证明，在我国少数民族在社会主义的道路上所获得的巨大进步和发展也同样证实了列宁这个原理的英明和正确。
    为了使各民族过渡到社会主义社会，就必须对各少数民族原来的社会政治制度进行必要的民主改革和社会主义改造。对于少数民族中的民主改革和社会主义改造，由于“各民族有不同的历史条件，决不能认为国内各民族都会在同一时间、用同样的方式进入社会主义。”中华人民共和国宪法序言规定：“国家在经济建设和文化建设的过程中将照顾各民族的需要，而在社会主义改造的问题上将充分注意各民族发展的特点”。“这就是说，在什么时候实行社会主义改造以及如何实行社会主义改造等等问题上，都将因为各民族发展情况的不同而有所不同。”（刘少奇：“关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告”）在一部分少数民族地区由于社会发展情况的特殊，那里的民主改革，是采取和平方法进行的，就是说不是通过强力斗争的方式强迫剥削者放弃剥削，而是通过和平协商的方式，说服的方法，使他们放弃剥削，同时国家采取适当措施维持他们的生活。
    现在在我国3，500多万少数民族人口中，已经有大约3，000多万人口的地区，基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造。其余的地区，有些正在进行以消灭领主制和奴隶制为基本目标的民主改革，在这个任务完成以后，就要进行社会主义改造；另外，有一小部分社会发展很落后，阶级分化极不明显的少数民族地区，也已经开始在进行社会主义改造。这即是说生产资料所有制的社会主义改造在绝大多数的少数民族中已经取得了基本的胜利。
    为了使各少数民族繁荣起来，发展成为社会主义的民族，除了进行社会改革以外，还必须在各民族地区发展社会主义经济建设和社会主义的民族文化。根本的关键是发展现代工业。在我国第一个五年计划期间，少数民族地区的经济和文化都有了一定的发展，有些少数民族地区有了很大的发展。根据最近的统计，截止到1956年底，国家已经在少数民族地区建立了423个现代工业。许多在解放前没有工业的民族，现在有了工业，并且有了自己的工人阶级。1956年全国民族自治区、自治州的工业总产值共17亿元，为1952年的229.5％，解放初期的426.6％；农副业总产值共44亿元，为1952年的128.2％，解放初期的217.2％；牲畜总头数是7，846.6万头，为1952年的134.4％，解放初期的168.2％。经济建设的发展，使各民族的物质文化生活都有了改善，1956年各自治区、自治州大、中、小学学生总数达405万，平均每一万人口中有学生1，000多人，医院病床13，268张，为解放初期的502％，医师5，101人，为解放初期的472％。到现在为止，已经为20个以前没有文字的民族，制定了文字方案，有的方案已经在试验推行。各民族自治县的经济和文化也都有了不同程度的发展。
    社会主义改造和社会主义建设的进展，使我国绝大多数少数民族的面貌发生了根本性的变化。各民族的关系，在汉族和大多数少数民族中社会主义改造不断胜利的基础上，更加团结和友好了，各民族之间的合作互助加强了。已经获得的成就，鼓舞着我国各族人民满怀信心地沿着社会主义道路向前迈进。（未完）
