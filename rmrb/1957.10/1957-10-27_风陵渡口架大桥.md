    A Large Bridge is Being Built at Fengling Ferry

    The construction of a temporary bridge between Fenglingdu in Shanxi and Tongguan in Shaanxi has completed the pile driving for eleven bridge piers.

    Originally, coal and other materials from Yuci and other places in Shanxi destined for the Northwest had to go via the South Tongpu Railway to Fenglingdu, without detouring through Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, and Tongguan. Then, they would be transported across the Yellow River by wooden boats or pontoon bridges, before being loaded onto trains in Tongguan and shipped onward. Once this bridge is completed, coal and other materials from Shanxi can be promptly transported to the Northwest to support industrial construction. (Su Yumin)

    风陵渡口架大桥
    山西风陵渡、陕西潼关之间的便桥，已经完成了十一个桥墩的打桩任务。
    原来，山西榆次等地的煤炭等各种物资运往西北，不绕道太原、石家庄、郑州、潼关，就得经南同蒲铁路到风陵渡，然后用木船或浮桥渡过黄河，再在潼关装车运走。这桥建成后，山西的煤炭等各种物资，就可及时地运往西北支援工业建设了。　（苏裕民）
