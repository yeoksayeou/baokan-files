Give it a try, you scoundrels! You think your eggshells are harder than steel! You think your victory
	can rely on enough madness! You think your lightning attacks
	shine brighter than Hitler's "lightning"! You think deploying your "new-style" minion weapons
	will make the people's camp, which possesses intercontinental missiles, surrender! How scary you are! Basket after basket, crate after crate, piled right up along the Syrian border, you crack, crack, crack...! Trying to smash the huge reinforced concrete buildings with egg yolk!!! Give it a try, you bandits! You think you can still run wild, you think you have a way out—
	you've found a place to fight! You think the Middle East is still easy to deceive,
	and the awakened people still worship you as king! You think the unity of two billion people doesn't count as strength, and the artificial satellite flying over your head hasn't made you panic! How bold you are! One thing after another, one incident after another, setting fire to the Syrian border, you burn, burn, burn...! Not afraid that the great fire of world people's liberation
	will burn you to ashes!!!

    试试看
    俯拾试试看，坏蛋！你以为你们的蛋壳硬过金钢！你以为你们的胜利
  可依靠足够的疯狂！你以为你们的闪电袭击
  比希特勒的“闪电”还发光！你以为出动你们的“新式”喽啰武器，
  就会使拥有洲际导弹的人民阵营投降！你们好吓人呀！一箩又一箩，一筐又一筐，直堆垒在叙利亚的国境旁，你们磕磕磕……！要把巨大的钢筋混凝土建筑碰出蛋黄！！！试试看，匪帮！你以为你们还能乱闯，你以为你们有出路——
  找到了打仗的地方！你以为中东依然可欺
  觉醒的人民还拜你为王！你以为二十几亿人民的团结不算力量，飞过你头上的人造卫星不曾使你发慌！你们好大胆呀！一件又一件，一桩又一桩，把火烧到叙利亚的国境旁，你们烧烧烧……！不怕世界人民解放的大火
  把你们烧光！！！
