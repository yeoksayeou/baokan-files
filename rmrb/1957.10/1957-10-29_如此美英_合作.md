Title: Such US-UK "Cooperation"

Just as the moon causes tides on Earth, the man-made satellite has caused the call for peaceful coexistence to surge around the world. Because all clear-minded people can clearly see that humanity has now entered an era where if nations cannot learn to live together like good neighbors, they will inevitably invite unparalleled disaster.

But the arsonists are not willing to stop. The communiqué issued after the three-day meeting between Eisenhower and Macmillan in Washington shows that the United States and Britain are still stubbornly refusing to accept the principle of peaceful coexistence, continuing to advocate "strength policy," and making every effort to strengthen the promotion of the nuclear arms race and military bloc policies.

The Soviet Union's stunning achievements in intercontinental missiles and man-made satellites have shattered the "position of strength" that the United States has always boasted about like a soap bubble, thereby depriving the US aggressive forces of the capital to carry out atomic blackmail. Therefore, recently, in the imperialist camp, laments and exclamations have been issued together, and the situation appears chaotic. The tendency of neutralism is developing, and some relatively realistic figures in power in Western countries are also beginning to realize that "coexistence is not the worst thing."

Under this situation, Eisenhower and Macmillan urgently held talks recently to stabilize the uneasy hearts of their own camp and reorganize the aggressive group, so as to continue to maintain the Cold War situation. To do this, they particularly emphasized the principle of "cooperation" between Western countries. The communiqué stated that "the idea of national self-sufficiency is now outdated" and that Western countries "are interdependent." It is said that this "cooperation" is most necessary in the military field, especially in the nuclear arms race. To show America’s “sincere cooperation,” Eisenhower has announced that he will ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act. In addition, the United States and Britain have jointly "called for strengthening the Atlantic Organization's efforts in scientific research and invention." This is actually to maintain the already unstable North Atlantic bloc countries by strengthening military preparations, and to continue to control these countries.

The United States, which has always kept atomic weapons secret from its "allies," is prepared to open the "scientific iron curtain" and "cooperate" with its allies. This reflects an important change in the international situation, which is that even the arrogant politicians in Washington now have to admit that the myth of American "superiority" has completely gone bankrupt. In order to seek new capital for the "policy of strength," so as to dispel the uneasiness of other Western countries and block the development of neutral tendencies, the US President and the British Prime Minister have no choice but to place their hopes on a vague illusion: the "cooperation" of Western countries may be able to reverse their disadvantage.

Despite the US President and the British Prime Minister being so enthusiastic about advocating "cooperation," the fundamental contradictions between them cannot be resolved. Even in this US-UK meeting, the differences between the two countries on the Middle East issue still exist. Of course, the two countries are consistent in their adherence to the colonialist position. The communiqué once again stated that the two countries support Turkey's provocative behavior and use the North Atlantic Organization to intimidate Arab countries; however, this does not mean that the United States and Britain have a consistent policy on the Middle East issue. Everyone knows that Macmillan brought a set of plans on the Middle East issue when he went to Washington, and even wanted to change the "Eisenhower Doctrine" into the "Eisenhower-Macmillan Doctrine." As a result, Eisenhower simply refused to pay attention to Macmillan's things, so that he couldn't help but complain at the press conference before leaving Washington that the communiqué on the Middle East issue was "not very clear."

In the Washington negotiations, Macmillan not only failed to realize his wishful thinking on the Middle East issue, but also the so-called "cooperation" between the United States and Britain in strengthening military blocs and developing nuclear weapons, which he was proud of, did not achieve results that were beneficial to Britain. Because stepping up the implementation of the policy of arms expansion and war preparation is not only difficult for Britain to bear economically, but it will make Britain further become a military appendage of the United States, and the consequences are very terrible. As for the other countries of the North Atlantic Group, the situation is the same.

The Soviet Union's advantages in science and technology will continue to develop; the principle of peaceful coexistence will continue to be more widely supported by the people. No matter how the US-British group struggles, this trend cannot be changed. The more they rush on the road of arms expansion and war preparation, the greater failures they will inevitably suffer.

    如此美英“合作”
    如同月亮引起了地球上的潮汐一样，人造卫星使得和平共处的呼声在全世界汹涌澎湃地高涨起来了。因为，所有头脑清醒的人都可以清楚地看到，目前人类已经进入这样一个时代，如果各个国家不能学会像好邻居那样一起生活，就必然会招致无可比拟的巨大灾难。
    但是，玩火者还不肯罢手。艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦在华盛顿会谈三天以后所发表的公报表明，美国和英国仍然顽固地拒绝接受和平共处的原则，继续鼓吹“实力政策”，竭力要求加强推行核军备竞赛和军事集团政策。
    苏联在洲际导弹和人造卫星方面的惊人成就，使得美国一直吹嘘的“实力地位”像肥皂泡一样地破灭了，从而使美国侵略势力失去了进行原子讹诈的资本。因此，最近以来，在帝国主义阵营里，哀叹与惊呼齐发，局面显得混乱不堪。中立主义的倾向正在发展着，西方国家某些比较有现实感的当权人物，也开始认识到“共处并不是一件最坏的事情”。
    在这种形势下，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦在最近迫不及待地举行会谈，目的就是要稳定一下自己阵营内动荡不安的人心，重整侵略集团的旗鼓，以便把冷战的局势继续维持下去。为了做到这一点，他们特别强调地提出了西方国家之间“合作”的原则。会谈公报宣称，“一国自足的观念现在已经过时”，西方国家“是互相依赖的”。据说这种“合作”在军事方面，特别是核军备竞赛方面显得最为必要。为了表示美国的“合作诚意”，艾森豪威尔已经宣布将要求国会修改麦克马洪法。此外，美英两国还共同“要求加强大西洋组织在科学研究和发明方面的努力”。这实际上就是要以加强备战来维系已经不稳的北大西洋集团国家，并借以继续控制这些国家。
    一向把原子武器对它的“盟国”保密的美国，准备打开“科学铁幕”而同它的盟国“合作”了。这反映了国际形势中的一个重要变化，就是连华盛顿那些狂妄的政客们现在也不得不承认美国“优势”的神话已经完全破产了。为了给“实力政策”寻求新的资本，以便驱除其它西方国家的不安情绪，阻挡中立倾向的发展，美国总统和英国首相只好把希望寄托在一个虚茫的幻想上：西方国家的“合作”将可能挽回自己的劣势。
    尽管美国总统和英国首相这样热中于倡导“合作”，但是它们之间的根本矛盾却是无法解决的。就在这次美英会谈中，两国对中东问题的分歧就依然存在。当然，在坚持殖民主义立场这一点上，两国的态度是一致的。公报里又一次申明两国支持土耳其的挑衅行为，并且利用北大西洋组织对阿拉伯国家进行恫吓；但是这并不说明美英两国在中东问题上已经有了一致的政策。大家知道，麦克米伦在去华盛顿时曾经带了一套关于中东问题的方案，甚至想把“艾森豪威尔主义”改变为“艾森豪威尔—麦克米伦主义”。结果，艾森豪威尔根本不愿意理睬麦克米伦的这一套东西，以致他在离开华盛顿前的记者招待会上不禁埋怨会谈公报中关于中东问题谈得“不很清楚”。
    在华盛顿谈判中，麦克米伦不但在中东问题上没有实现他的如意算盘，而且就是他所得意的美英在加强军事集团和发展核武器方面的所谓“合作”，也并没有得到对英国有利的结果。因为，加紧推行扩军备战的政策，不仅在经济上是英国所难以负担的，而且它将使英国更进一步成为美国军事上的附庸，其后果是十分可怕的。至于对北大西洋集团的其他国家说来，情形也是一样。
    苏联在科学技术方面的优势将继续向前发展；和平共处的原则也将继续得到人们的更为广泛的拥护。美英集团不管怎样挣扎，这个趋势是改变不了的。它们愈向扩军备战的道路上狂奔，它们就必然要遭受更大的失败。
