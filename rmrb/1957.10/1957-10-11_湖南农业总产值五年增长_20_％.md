　　Xinhua News Agency report: According to estimates from the provincial statistics department, Hunan Province's total agricultural output value this year will increase by approximately 20% compared to 1952. In 1952, the province's total grain output was 20.6 billion jin, and this year it is estimated to reach 23 billion jin.
　　During the First Five-Year Plan period, Hunan Province experienced one year of flooding and three years of drought. However, agricultural production still saw significant development. This is inseparable from the vigorous efforts in water conservancy construction. Over the past five years, the province has renovated a total of more than 2,760,000 large and small water conservancy projects, newly built 2,947 small reservoirs, and constructed more than 249,000 new ponds and dams. In addition, the province has universally promoted advanced techniques such as standardized seedling nurseries, salt water seed selection, and close planting, and has also improved 3 million mu of low-yielding land.

　　湖南农业总产值五年增长20％
    新华社讯　据省统计部门预计：湖南省今年农业生产总值将比1952年增长20％左右。1952年全省粮食总产量为二百零六亿斤，今年预计可产二百三十亿斤。
    湖南省在第一个五年计划期间，一年有水灾，三年有旱灾，但是农业生产仍有很大发展，这是同大力进行水利建设分不开的。五年来，全省共整修大小水利工程二百七十六万多处次，新建小型水库二千九百四十七座，新建塘坝工程二十四万九千多处。此外，全省还普遍推广了合式秧田、盐水选种和密植等先进技术，又改良了三百万亩低产田。
