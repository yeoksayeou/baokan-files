It's Not That There Isn't Enough Grain, But That Socialist Consciousness Isn't High Enough
    Well-to-do Middle Peasants Hoard the Most Grain and Shout the Loudest About Grain Shortages
    Secrets Revealed in the Great Debate in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Well-to-do Middle Peasants are Best at Playing Poor
    (Our newspaper's report) Recently, in the socialist great debate carried out in the rural areas of the suburbs of Beijing, a secret of the grain problem was revealed: It turns out that the people who shout the loudest about low grain retention standards and not having enough grain to eat are none other than those well-to-do middle peasants who have a lot of grain stored at home.

    For example, Lu Wenshan, a well-to-do middle peasant member of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative, always clamored "there is not enough grain to eat" and "we are going to starve," but in reality, he is a large surplus grain household with eight thousand catties of old grain stored. Much of the corn, beans, wheat, and other grains stored have been eaten by insects, gnawed by rats, and have become moldy and deteriorated.

    Han Yongxiang, Han Yongzhen, Xu Rong and other well-to-do middle peasants from Liulitun Township often ran to the grain and fodder cadres to clamor that there was not enough grain to eat, begging the state to supplement their grain supply. However, after investigating this time, it turns out that these households are all surplus grain households with a large amount of grain stored. Han Yongxiang's family originally said "there's nothing to eat tonight," but as it turns out they have stored nearly seven hundred catties of grain. Han Yongzhen's family has stored more than one thousand one hundred catties of various grains.

    Through a heated debate caused by poor peasant woman Gu Shulan and well-to-do middle peasant woman Yang Xiuzhen, the second production team of the fourth brigade of the Fengshou Agricultural Cooperative in Machikou Township, Changping District, finally clarified that Yang Xiuzhen, the well-to-do middle peasant in the whole team who shouted the loudest about the grain shortage, still had more than one hundred and twenty catties of surplus grain at home.

    The great debate also revealed that many peasants did not lack grain at all, but they also followed the well-to-do middle peasants in shouting about grain shortages, demanding that the state raise grain retention standards and increase supplies. For example, the peasants in Jinzhan Township in the eastern suburbs, with an average annual grain retention of three hundred and seventy-five catties per person, originally had enough to eat and use. However, the peasants in this township often shouted that there was not enough grain to eat, and demanded that the state supply a large amount of grain. After investigation this time, among the seventy-two households shouting about grain shortages, sixty-nine households did not lack grain at all, and also had more than 30,000 catties of stored grain. In addition to this year's rations, there are still more than 20,000 catties of surplus grain. Another example is the second production team of the fourth brigade of the Fengshou Agricultural Cooperative in Machikou Township, Changping District. Many households were also shouting that they did not have enough to eat. After debate, it was proved that only one household, that of poor peasant Wang Yurong, was truly short of grain.

    Members of the Hongguang Fourth Cooperative Display Old Grain
    Well-to-do Middle Peasants Who Shouted About Grain Shortages Admit Their Mistakes
    (Our newspaper's report) On the evening of September 21, dazzling gas lamps hung in the meeting place of the Hongguang Fourth Cooperative in Ludian Town, Dengfeng County, Henan Province. The cooperative members carried grain to debate with Jia Chunhe, a well-to-do middle peasant who often said that there was not enough grain to eat. In the face of ironclad facts, Jia Chunhe was speechless and lowered his head to admit his mistake.

    Jia Chunhe was swept into the cooperative by the great storm of cooperativization. After joining the cooperative, he disliked labor and did not produce well, and his income was reduced compared to before joining the cooperative. Therefore, he has always been dissatisfied with the cadres, dissatisfied with the Party, dissatisfied with cooperativization, and dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sale of grain. The masses gave him the nickname "Four Dissatisfactions." In this socialist education movement, he said everywhere: "Cooperatives are not as good as working individually." One day, he ran to the town people's committee several times, requesting to withdraw from the cooperative. He said: "The unified purchase and sale strangles people. Three hundred and eighty catties of grain is not enough to eat at all. I don't eat steamed buns all day long, I only drink porridge." "80% of the people in the cooperative don't have anything to eat. The new society is not as good as begging for food in the old society!" These absurd remarks aroused the anger of the broad masses. Since the launch of the great debate, he has debated with him four times in large and small meetings, but Jia Chunhe always refused to admit his mistakes.

    In order to thoroughly criticize Jia Chunhe's capitalist ideology, on the evening of September 21, 135 of the 170 middle and poor peasant households in the whole cooperative carried old grain, totaling more than 4,200 catties, to launch the fifth battle against him. At the beginning of the debate, Han Duo stood up and said: "Chunhe, how can you say that life now is not as good as begging for food in the past! Don't you really know that the five members of Han Gouwa's family all starved to death while begging for food outside in 1942? How many families do you see begging for food now?" Jia Chunhe then said: "What I said is that there is not much grain now, and many people don't have anything to eat, but there is no one begging for food." As soon as he said this, more than 30 people stood up and asked to speak. Old man Li Tianku, 67 years old, leaned on crutches, carried grain and squeezed to the front, put the grain in front of Jia Chunhe, and said: "Chunhe, you are young and strong, you can't talk against your conscience! My family has five people, three adults and two children. I get the same amount of grain as you. My family has never been without steamed buns. Whether we eat well or not, the neighbors know. I still have old corn, how can you say there is not enough grain to eat?" Zhai Xiaobao took the old wheat and old lentils distributed last year and said to Jia Chunhe: "Your family has four adults and two children, six people in total. My family also has four adults and two children, six people in total, the same as you. Last year during the wheat season, you got more wheat than me, but I still have old wheat, but you don't have enough to eat." At this time, Jia Chunhe stammered and said: "I... I heard someone in Group One of Team Three shouting, so I shouted too!" Rong Laohu walked forward and said: "Who did you hear say that our group doesn't have anything to eat! Our group has 17 households, 85 people, everyone has enough to eat, every household has surplus grain. Come, carry all the grain here and let him see!" In an instant, a large pile of grain bags were placed in front of Jia Chunhe. This one said, this is old millet, that one said, this is old mung beans. At this time, Jia Chunhe said: "My capitalist ideology is too serious. To be honest, my family also has more than 200 catties of wheat, more than 50 catties of corn, more than 20 catties of mung beans, and more than 30 catties of lentils. My family eats good things at home, and when we go out, we take bran and egg steamed buns and shout that there is nothing to eat. I was wrong, I am determined to take the socialist road with everyone in the future!"

    Hoarding Three Thousand Catties and Still Shouting About Grain Shortages
    Farmers in Chezhan Township Expose Jia Liubao
    (Our newspaper's report) On September 17, farmers in Chezhan Township, Xuedian, Henan Province, held a debate to refute Jia Liubao, a well-to-do middle peasant who falsely shouted about grain shortages, and exposed his hoarding of grain.

    Jia Liubao's family has five people (actually four at home now). His family clearly has a large amount of surplus grain stored, but he pretends to be poor and complains all day long, saying that there is nothing to eat, and pesters the cadres all day long, asking to buy grain.

    After the debate, Jia Liubao admitted that his past shouts about grain shortages were completely false. He now has more than 3,000 catties of surplus grain and more than 1,000 catties of old jujubes stored at home, and expressed his willingness to sell all these surplus grain to the state and resolutely take the socialist road.

### 不是粮食不够而是社会主义觉悟不够  富裕中农存粮最多叫喊缺粮最凶

　　不是粮食不够而是社会主义觉悟不够
    富裕中农存粮最多叫喊缺粮最凶
    京郊大辩论中揭穿了秘密
    富裕中农最会装穷
    本报讯　最近，在北京郊区农村开展的社会主义大辩论中，揭穿了一个粮食问题的秘密：原来叫喊留粮标准低、粮食不够吃最凶的人不是别人，正是那些家中存着不少粮食的富裕中农。
    比如前进农业社的富裕中农社员陆文山，老是吵嚷“粮食不够吃”“要挨饿了”，实际上却是一个存有八千斤陈粮的大余粮户。存的玉米、豆子、小麦等粮食，有好多都被虫吃、鼠咬、发霉变质了。
    六里屯乡的富裕中农韩永祥、韩永珍、徐荣等经常跑到粮秣干事那里吵嚷粮食不够吃，央告国家补充供应粮食给他们。可是，这次一了解，这几户都是存有大批粮食的余粮户。韩永祥家原来说“今天晚上就没吃”，结果，存了近七百斤粮食。韩永珍家存了各色粮食一千一百多斤。
    昌平区马池口乡丰收农业社第四大队第二生产队，通过由贫农妇女谷淑兰和富裕中农妇女杨秀珍所引起的一场热烈的辩论，才弄清楚全队叫喊缺粮最凶的富裕中农杨秀珍，家里还有余粮一百二十多斤。
    大辩论中还发现不少农民本来并不缺粮，但是也跟着富裕中农叫喊缺粮，要求国家提高留粮标准，增加供应。比如东郊区金盏乡的农民，平均每人全年留粮三百七十五斤，本来完全够吃够用。但是，这个乡的农民却经常叫喊粮食不够吃，要求国家供应了大量粮食。这次经过调查，七十二户叫喊缺粮的农民中，有六十九户根本不缺粮，而且还有存粮三万多斤。除去今年的口粮外，还有余粮二万多斤。再如昌平区马池口乡丰收农业社第四大队第二生产队，也有很多户喊着不够吃，经过辩论证明，真正缺粮的只有贫农王玉容一户。
    红光四社社员摆出陈粮
    叫喊缺粮的富裕中农认错
    本报讯　9月21日晚上，河南省登封县卢店镇红光四社的会场上悬挂着耀眼的汽灯。社员们都扛着粮食来向常说粮食不够吃的富裕中农贾春和进行辩论。贾春和在铁的事实面前，哑口无言，低头认错。
    贾春和是被合作化的大风暴卷进社的，入社后厌恶劳动不好生产，收入比入社前有所减少。因此，他一贯不满意干部，不满意党，不满意合作化，不满意粮食统购统销，群众给他起名叫“四不满”。这次社会主义教育运动中，他到处说：“合作社不如单干。”有一天他曾往镇人民委员会连跑几趟，要求退社。他说：“统购统销卡死了人，三百八十斤粮食根本不够吃，我整天不吃馍，光喝稀饭。”“社里80％的人都没啥吃，新社会还不如旧社会逃荒要饭好！”他这些荒谬言论，激起了广大群众的愤怒。开展大辩论以来，大会，小会，已和他辩论四次，但贾春和总是不承认错误。
    为了彻底批判贾春和的资本主义思想，9月21日晚上，全社一百七十户中、贫农，有一百三十五户都扛着陈粮，共四千二百多斤，向他展开第五次论战。辩论会一开始，韩铎站起来说：“春和，你咋说现在的生活不如过去逃荒要饭好呢！你真不知道韩狗娃全家五口人1942年逃荒在外全都饿死了的事吗？如今你见过几家逃荒要饭呢？”贾春和接着说：“我说的是现在粮食不多，好些人都没啥吃，其实是没有逃荒的。”这一说，有三十几个人站起来要求发言。六十七岁的李天库老汉拄着拐杖，背着粮食挤到前面，把粮食往贾春和面前一搁，说：“春和，你年轻少壮，讲话可不能昧良心！我家五口人，三个大人两个小孩，我和你一样分粮食，俺家的馍可没断过，吃的好不好，左邻右舍都知道。我还有陈玉米，你咋说粮食少不够吃呢？”翟小保拿着去年分的陈麦、陈扁豆对贾春和说：“你家四个大人两个小孩六口人，俺家也是四个大人两个小孩六口人，和你一样。去年麦季分麦子，你比我分的还多哩，可是我还有陈麦子，你却不够吃了”。这时贾春和结结巴巴地说：“我……我是听三队一组有人叫喊，我才喊啦！”荣老虎向前走了走说：“你听谁说俺组没啥吃！俺组十七户，八十五口人，人人都够吃，户户有余粮。来，都把粮食扛来叫他看！”霎时间，贾春和面前的粮食一袋一袋摆了一大片。这个说，这是陈谷子，那个说，这是陈绿豆。这时，贾春和才说：“我的资本主义思想太严重了，说实在话，俺家也还有二百多斤麦，五十多斤玉米，二十多斤绿豆，三十多斤扁豆。俺家在家吃好的，出来拿着麸子蛋馍，叫喊没啥吃。我错了，我以后决心和大家一起走社会主义道路！”
　　囤积三千斤还叫缺粮
　　车站乡农民揭露贾六保
    本报讯　9月17日，河南省薛店车站乡农民举行了辩论会，驳倒了假喊叫缺粮的富裕中农贾六保，并揭发了他囤粮的事实。
    贾六保家有五口人（现在实际在家四口）。他家里明明存有大批的余粮，却一天到晚装穷叫苦，说没有啥吃，整天缠着干部不放，要求买粮。
    经过辩论，贾六保承认了自己过去喊叫缺粮完全是假的，现在他家中存有余粮三千多斤和陈大枣一千斤以上，并表示愿意把这些余粮全部卖给国家，坚决走社会主义道路。
