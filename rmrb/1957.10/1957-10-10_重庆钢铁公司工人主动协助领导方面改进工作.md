Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Electric Dispatch: During the rectification movement, workers at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company actively assisted the leadership in improving their work.

Old worker Xu Deshan of the iron smelting workshop suggested that there was a place in the waste iron processing yard of No. 2 blast furnace that was inconvenient to work on because it lacked iron plates. When the leadership sent someone to investigate, old worker Wang Zhicheng said, "We know that the workshop has been engaged in vigorous airing of views these past few days, and many opinions have been raised everywhere. The leadership is too busy to handle everything, so let's find a way to solve it ourselves." So they tried to find iron plates and solved the problem themselves. Workers in this workshop repaired 36 of the 76 material carts and handcarts that needed repair in one day.

In the heavy rolling mill workshop, at the suggestion of Xu Zhanrong, an old worker and model worker, a "rectification and construction team" was formed by seventeen workers of different trades. They immediately solved any problems they discovered. In the past week, they have handled twenty-four problems. The slag removal ditch in this workshop was very deep, making it inconvenient for workers to go up and down. After this problem was raised, the "rectification and construction team" made two ladders out of iron bars, which everyone was very satisfied with.

Many workers also suggested: The country depends on us for construction, and we cannot rely on the government for everything. If we have difficulties, we should find ways to solve them ourselves. Workers in the open-hearth furnace proposed to build houses by raising funds collectively; many employees initiated the adoption of a self-built and publicly assisted method to cooperate with the leadership in solving the problem of insufficient housing in the factory.

    重庆钢铁公司工人主动协助领导方面改进工作
    据新华社重庆电　重庆钢铁公司工人在整风运动中，主动协助领导方面改进工作。
    炼铁车间的老工人徐德山提出二高炉废铁加工料场有块地方没有铁板不便工作。领导方面派人去了解时，老工人王志成说：“我们晓得车间这几天在大鸣大放，各处提的意见很多，领导上忙不过来，我们自己想办法吧。”于是他们就设法找铁板自己解决了这个问题。这个车间的工人一天内把该修理的七十六部料车和手推车修好了三十六部。
    大型轧钢车间修理在工段，老工人、劳动模范徐占荣的倡议下，由十七个不同工种的工人组成一个“整改施工小组”，发现可能解决的问题就立即动手解决。一周以来他们就处理了二十四个问题。这个车间除渣沟很深，工人上下不方便，这个问题提出以后，“整改施工小组”就用铁条作了两架扶梯，大家很满意。
    不少工人还提出：国家要靠我们来建设，我们不能样样都靠公家，有困难想办法自己解决。大平炉间工人倡议用大家集资的办法来修建住房；不少职工发起采用自建公助办法，配合领导共同来解决厂里住房不够的问题。
