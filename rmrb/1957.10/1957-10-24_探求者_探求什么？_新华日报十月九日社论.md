The bourgeois rightists have launched an attack on socialism, and the literary and art circles are a key focus. During this period, a batch of demons and monsters revealed their true colors in Jiangsu Province's literary and art circles. Some wanted to start coterie poetry journals and drama publications, some wanted to start coterie newspapers, some wanted to start coterie publishing houses, and some wanted to invade our Party newspaper to seize a position, and so on. In such circumstances, there was "a group of young literary workers," some of whom were Communist Party members, who "gathered together" as a coterie to run a "Seeker" literary monthly, and claimed to "eternally" "seek" what they wanted to "seek." What kind of group is this? What are their intentions? What things are they trying to "seek"? These questions are worth our "seeking" into.

The "Seekers" have their announcements and articles of association. According to their announcements and articles of association, the reason they want to "seek" is their dissatisfaction and opposition to the current state of the new society.

There are three main aspects of the status quo they are dissatisfied with and oppose:

First, they are dissatisfied with the harm of so-called "dogmatism." They said: "In recent years, the dogmatic viewpoint of regarding everything old as bad and everything new as good has caused serious harm, hindering the healthy development of ideological consciousness. It has particularly hindered the growth of the younger generation." (It is worth noting here that "regarding everything old as bad and everything new as good" is seen by them as a "dogmatic viewpoint," and in their view, the "healthy development of ideological consciousness" and the "growth of the younger generation" depend on protecting old things and negating new things.) "Dogmatism also reduces the vast and unified social life into fragmented dogmas, rigidifying people's normal life." (According to the above, it is not difficult to understand: what is "vast and unified social life" and "people's normal life"? Is it the new socialist life, or the old capitalist life?) From here, we can see clearly what they mean by "dogmatism." It is nothing else but Marxism. Because Marxism guides us to destroy the old capitalist life, build a new socialist life, eliminate the old things in people's ideological consciousness, and establish a new ideological consciousness—communist ideological consciousness. Precisely because of this, they are disgusted. They want to denounce it as dogmatism.

Second, they are dissatisfied with class struggle. They said: "In the past, in the long-term class struggle, due to the needs of the time, we took political attitude as the main criterion for measuring a person's quality, often neglecting the multi-faceted construction of social moral life." "Today, we see various defects in people's moral character, and we also see that class struggle has left many shadows on people, hindering the establishment of normal relations between people. Indifference is a common feeling." Here, what they are cursing is precisely our socialist revolution and socialist construction. Socialists advocate the elimination of classes, and believe that only through class struggle can the goal of eliminating classes be achieved. In practice, this is what we do, and we indeed "take political attitude as the main criterion for measuring a person's quality," and this was the case in the past, it is the case today, and it will be the case in the future. What about the new socialist China established in this way? They think that "indifference is a common feeling." Their political attitude and "personal qualities" are evident here.

Third, they are dissatisfied with "government-run" affairs. What is expressed in writing is dissatisfaction with "government-run" magazines. In addition, they are also dissatisfied with "government-run" post offices, publishing houses, art groups, and so on. Regarding magazines, they said: "We also believe that running a magazine by voluntary association has many advantages compared with running a magazine by administrative means." "The disadvantage of running a magazine by administrative means is that it is 'government-run.' Although it declares that it is not an organ publication, it cannot get rid of the nature of an organ publication." "We are very dissatisfied with the way some literary magazines are run at present," "the editorial department lacks independent opinions and does not show the spirit of exploring life"; "Although the content of this kind of mixed magazine is called 'letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend,' it reflects the weakness of the editorial department's fighting power and the confusion of artistic ideas. This is the inevitable result of running a magazine by administrative means." The issue is very clear: administrative means is the "government-run" method; the so-called "government-run" actually refers to the leadership of the Communist Party. They are saying that the current situation is: things have been messed up due to the leadership of the Party. Therefore, they want to break away from the Party to "explore the road to socialism" and "explore the road of life."

Dissatisfaction with the current situation of Marxist ideological leadership, dissatisfaction with the current situation of socialist revolution, and dissatisfaction with the current situation of Communist Party leadership are the reasons why the "Seekers" want to "seek" something else.

Since it is called "seeking," is there a direction and goal for the seeking? They do have one. Perhaps because they are still in the "seeking" stage, their direction and goal are not as clearly stated as their declared dissatisfaction. They vaguely say that "the road to building socialism is still being explored," and "in the process of building socialism, the road of life is even more complex and requires more multi-faceted exploration." They want to resolutely remove socialism from the creation method of socialist realism, and separately "seek" a "school" to emerge. In this way, the slogan of "seeking" they put forward is: "Break the shackles of dogmatism, boldly intervene in life, seriously explore life, and promote socialism."

Since they are dissatisfied with the status quo, they can only seek the opposite of the status quo. Leaving the guiding ideology of Marxism, leaving the leadership of the Communist Party, and leaving the socialist road will inevitably lead to the capitalist road. The two must occupy one, which is a common sense that is clear without seeking. Therefore, their so-called "breaking the shackles of dogmatism" is to break the leadership of Marxism and the Communist Party; their so-called "boldly intervening in life" is to oppose the socialist system; their so-called "seriously exploring life" is to negate the dialectical materialist worldview and outlook on life; this is the essence of their so-called "seeking." As for the so-called "promoting socialism," it is to "promote" socialism to the direction and goals they are "seeking."

After Marx "sought" scientific socialism, a socialist Soviet Union emerged in practice. The construction achievements of the past forty years are unparalleled in world history. Chinese advanced elements, from 1840, were "seeking" the road of social development, until after the October Revolution, Marxism-Leninism was brought to China, and the conclusion of taking the Russian road was made. Comrade Mao Zedong made a thorough explanation of this point in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." For decades, China has been advancing on the road of democratic revolution and socialist revolution, making China an independent and strong country in the world. Not only is material construction developing rapidly, but the spiritual outlook of society has also undergone fundamental changes. The social system of people eating people is gone forever. Exploitation, oppression, mutual deception, pursuit of private gain, using money to maintain relationships between people, selling bodies and souls... haven't these been cleared away like clearing garbage heaps? And mutual assistance, unity, mutual respect between people, picking up lost money, rescuing the dying and healing the wounded... haven't these new moral customs been formed? Can't these phenomena be seen everywhere at any time in stations, wharves, streets, and alleys? "Entering a room full of orchids, one may not smell the fragrance after a long time," this is possible. In fact, every ordinary small thing is a branch and leaf in the great socialist revolution and construction. The slanders of "indifference is a common feeling" and "dogmatism hinders the healthy development of ideological consciousness" are malicious attacks on the Party and on socialism. It also reflects the dark psychology of these anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wing figures. The great changes in our motherland are precisely the result of the guidance of Marxism, the result of the leadership of the Communist Party, and the result of observing problems from a class viewpoint and practicing the theory of class struggle. If class struggle has left any "shadow," it is the garbage left by the exploiting class society, and we must eliminate it, and we are always eliminating it. It has only been eight years since liberation. In the future, we will continue to complete the socialist road under the leadership of the Party and according to the guiding ideology of Marxism. Comrade Mao Zedong said as early as in "On New Democracy": "Communism is the entire ideological system of the proletariat and a new social system. This ideological system and social system are different from any other ideological system and any other social system, and are the most complete, the most progressive, the most revolutionary and the most reasonable since the history of mankind. ... It is surging throughout the world with overwhelming force, thunderous force, and magnificent beauty, and maintaining its beautiful youth." Haven't the facts of world history proven this point?

Of course, there are twists and turns on the road of socialist development, and shortcomings and errors will also occur. However, the members of "Seekers" regard the tortuous road as a need to change direction; they exaggerate the shortcomings and errors in work into "dark sides" rooted in the new system; they clamor about "rigidification" and other absurdities; and thus draw the conclusion that they must leave the leadership of the Party and the socialist road to make another "seeking." Although they did not blatantly raise the banner of restoring capitalism, it should be known that among the right-wing gentlemen, there are not many who directly and frankly say that they oppose socialism and restore capitalism (this also shows their "moral character"). They always speak in a roundabout way and stutteringly. And when the road of socialism and the road of life in socialist society have been established, they proposed to "seek," and to "seek" according to their direction and goal, anyone can see clearly that they are a component of the right wing's attack on the Party. Therefore, if people ask what the nature of "Seekers" is, we can only say that they are anti-Party and anti-socialist.

Anti-Party, anti-socialist, taking the capitalist road, and adhering to the Party's leadership and adhering to the socialist road, this is the struggle between two roads, this is class struggle. Class struggle is an objective existence. It is not that we have a penchant for class struggle, but that the exploiting and oppressive classes are carrying out cruel exploitation and oppression of the exploited and oppressed classes. Only by using class struggle to eliminate the class system can we finally eliminate class struggle and create truly favorable conditions for the "healthy development of ideological consciousness." Therefore, how can we not take political attitude as the main criterion for measuring a person's quality? If we cannot distinguish class standpoints, we cannot distinguish right from wrong. Here, we must first use political attitude to measure this group of "Seekers" in order to understand the essence of "Seekers" and recognize the true face of each "Seeker."

Why did they embark on the anti-Party, anti-socialist road? The political faces of these few people can also reveal the problem. There are right-wing elements who have been exposed, there are elements who have been expelled from the Party, and the main body is a combination of a group of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. They have not transformed their thinking, and they have extremely serious individualism and liberalism; they do not regard literary and art undertakings as the Party's proletarian revolutionary cause, a cause for serving the people, but as a cause for individuals to become famous and climb up, develop bourgeois individualism, and leave their names in "literary history"; they are so arrogant and self-important that they put nothing in their eyes. They think that they have written a few articles and published one or two books, and they are greatly proud. Even the Party organization is no longer in their eyes. Several of the Party members openly claimed that the Party did not understand literature and art. Therefore, they carried out anti-socialist coterie activities behind the Party organization. And they openly challenged the Party Central Committee, declaring: "We do not recognize that socialist realism is the best creative method." This is their increasingly developing serious bourgeois literary and artistic line. This reactionary line is incompatible with the Party's socialist literary and artistic line. Therefore, they regard the Party's leadership as a "shackle of dogmatism" that must be "broken," oppose the Party's supervision and criticism, and oppose the Party's literary and artistic line. This is also an important reason why the Party's principles and policies cannot be implemented in the literary and art circles. During the entire period of the bourgeois right wing's attack on the Party, they took the opportunity to carry out activities vigorously and played a coordinating role, which was not accidental.

In order to defend the proletarian literary and art cause and defend the socialist literary and art line, we require the literary and art circles to take action, deeply criticize "Seekers," thoroughly criticize their political and artistic viewpoints, carry out the struggle between two roads in the literary and art circles, clarify the ideological confusion in the literary and art circles, and raise the level of understanding. This is a serious class struggle on the political front, an irreconcilable socialist revolutionary struggle. Every literary and art worker should participate in this struggle and accept the lessons learned. Only in this way can we remove the obstacles on the socialist literary and artistic road, create and develop a new national socialist literature and art, and make it prosperous, flourishing, brilliant and splendid.

    “探求者”探求什么？
    新华日报十月九日社论
    资产阶级右派向社会主义发动进攻，文艺界是一个重点。江苏省的文艺界也在这个期间，暴露出一批牛鬼蛇神的真面目。有的要搞同人诗刊和戏剧刊物，有的要搞同人报纸，有的要搞同人出版社，有的要打到我们党报里面来占领阵地，如此等等。就在这样的情况下，有“一群年轻的文学工作者”，其中有几个共产党员，他们“结集起来”成为同人，要办个“探求者”文学月刊社，并声称要“永远”去“探求”他们所要“探求”的东西。这究竟是个什么团体？他们的用意何在？他们要“探求”些什么东西？这些问题倒值得我们“探求”一番。
      “探求者”们有他们的启事和章程。根据他们的启事和章程来看，原来他们要“探求”的原因，就是不满新社会的现状，反对新社会的现状。
    他们不满意的和反对的现状主要有三：
    第一，他们不满意所谓“教条主义”的危害。他们说：“近几年来，把一切旧东西看成坏的，把一切新东西看成好的，这种教条主义的观点已经造成了严重的危害，阻碍了思想意识的健康发展。更特出地妨碍了年青一代的成长”。（这里值得注意的是：“把一切旧东西看成坏的，把一切新东西看成好的”，在他们看来，这就是“教条主义的观点”，而在他们看来，“思想意识的健康发展”，“年青一代的成长”，就要靠了保护旧东西，否定新东西。）“教条主义又把浩瀚统一的社会生活归结成支离破碎的教条，僵化了人们的正常生活”。（据根上文，也不难了解：所谓“浩瀚统一的社会生活”，“人们的正常生活”，究竟是一种什么生活，是社会主义的新生活，还是资本主义的老生活。）从这里我们可以看清楚，他们所说的“教条主义”是什么？不是别的，是马克思主义。因为马克思主义，指导着我们破坏资本主义的老生活，建设社会主义的新生活，扫除人们思想意识中的旧东西，确立新的思想意识——共产主义的思想意识。正因为这样，所以他们是反感的。他们要斥之为教条主义。
    第二，他们不满意阶级斗争。他们说：“我们过去在长期的阶级斗争中，由于当时的需要，把政治态度作为衡量人的品质的主要标准，往往忽略了社会道德生活的多方面的建设”。“今天，我们看到了人们道德面貌上存在着各种缺陷，也看到了阶级斗争给人们留下了许多阴影，妨碍了人们之间正常关系的建立。人情淡薄，人所共感。”这里他们所诅咒的正是我们的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。社会主义者是主张消灭阶级的，而且认为只有进行阶级斗争才能达到消灭阶级的目的。实际上是这么做的，的确“把政治态度作为衡量人的品质的主要标准”，过去如此，今天如此，将来还是如此。这样建立起来的社会主义新中国如何呢？他们认为“人情淡薄，人所共感”。他们的政治态度和“人的品质”也就于此可见。
    第三，他们不满意“官办的”事情。在书面上表现出来的是不满意“官办的”杂志。另外，他们还不满意“官办的”邮政、出版社、文艺团体等等。关于杂志，他们说：“我们还认为，自愿结合来办杂志，和用行政方式办杂志比较起来有很多优越之处”。“用行政方式办杂志的缺点在于它是‘官办的’，尽管声明并非机关刊物，但是却摆脱不了机关刊物的性质。”“对于目前有一些文艺杂志的办法，我们很不满意”，“编辑部缺乏独立的见解，显示不出探讨人生的精神”；“这种拼盘杂凑的杂志内容虽然美其名曰‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’，却反映了编辑部战斗力量的薄弱，以及艺术思想的混乱。这是用行政方式来办杂志的必然结果。”问题很明白，行政方式，就是“官办的”方式；所谓“官办”者，实指共产党之领导也。他们是在说：当前的现状是：由于党的领导，才办糟了事情。所以他们要抛开党来“探求社会主义的道路”，“探求人生的道路”。
    不满意马克思主义的思想领导的现状，不满意社会主义革命的现状，不满意共产党领导的现状，这就是“探求者”要去“探求”另外什么东西的原因。
    既称“探求”，是不是有个探求的方向和目标呢？他们是有的。大概因为到底还是在“探求”的缘故吧，他们的方向和目标不像他们所宣称的不满那样说的明确。他们含糊地说什么“建成社会主义的道路还在探索”，“那么，在建成社会主义的过程中，人生的道路就更为复杂，更需要多方面进行探讨。”他们要在社会主义现实主义的创作方法上坚决抽去社会主义，另外去“探求”一个“流派”出来。这样，他们提出的“探求”的口号就是：“打破教条束缚，大胆干预生活，严肃探讨人生，促进社会主义。”
    他们既然不满意现状，当然只能探求到现状的反面去。离开马克思主义的指导思想，离开共产党的领导，离开社会主义道路，必然走向资本主义道路。二者必居其一，这是不用探求就很明白的常识。因此，他们所谓“打破教条束缚”，就是要打破马克思主义和共产党的领导；所谓“大胆干预生活”，就是反对社会主义的制度；所谓“严肃探讨人生”，就是否定辩证唯物主义的世界观和人生观；这就是他们所谓“探求”的实质。至于所谓“促进社会主义”，也就是要把社会主义“促进”到他们所“探求”的那些方向和目标去。
    从马克思“探求”出科学的社会主义以后，在实践中出现了一个社会主义的苏联，四十年来的建设成就，是世界史上无与伦比的。中国的先进分子，从1840年起，就在
  “探求”社会发展的道路，直到十月革命以后，给中国送来了马克思列宁主义，才做出走俄国人的路的结论。毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中曾就这一点作过透彻的说明。几十年来，中国在民主革命和社会主义革命的道路上前进，使中国成为世界上独立、强盛的国家，不但物质建设在日新月异地发展，而且社会的精神面貌也起了根本变化。人吃人的社会制度是一去不复返了，剥削、压迫、尔虞我诈、营私作弊、用金钱维系人与人之间的关系、出卖肉体和灵魂……这些不是像清除垃圾堆一样地被清除了吗？而互助、团结、人与人之间的彼此尊敬、拾金不昧、救死扶伤……这些新的道德风气不是已经形成了吗？车站、码头、街头、巷尾，不是随时随地可见这种现象吗？“入芝兰之室，久而不闻其香”，这是可能的。实际上每项平凡的小事，都是伟大的社会主义革命和建设中的一枝一叶。什么“人情淡薄，人所共感”，什么“教条主义阻碍了思想意识的健康发展”之类的污蔑，则是对党、对社会主义的恶意攻击。也正反映了这些反党、反社会主义的右派人物自己的阴暗心理。我们的祖国的伟大变化，正是马克思主义指导的结果，正是共产党领导的结果，正是用阶级观点观察问题和实践了阶级斗争的理论的结果。如果说阶级斗争留下了什么“阴影”的话，那是剥削阶级的社会留下的垃圾，我们必须清除它，我们时刻都在清除着它。解放还只有八年，今后我们要继续在党的领导下，根据马克思主义的指导思想，走完社会主义的道路。毛泽东同志早在“新民主主义论”中说过：“共产主义是无产阶级的整个思想体系，同时又是一种新的社会制度。这种思想体系和社会制度，是区别于任何别的思想体系和任何别的社会制度的，是自有人类历史以来，最完全最进步最革命最合理的。……正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春。”世界历史发展的事实，不是证明了这一点吗？
    当然，在社会主义发展的道路上，有曲折，也会产生缺点和错误。但是，“探求者”的同人把曲折的道路，看成要改变方向；把工作中的缺点和错误，夸大成为根生于新制度的“阴暗面”；叫嚣什么“僵化”了之类的谰言；从而得出要离开党的领导和社会主义道路另作“探求”的结论。他们虽然没有明目张胆打出恢复资本主义的旗帜，然而，要晓得：在右派先生们里，直言无隐，干脆说出自己反对社会主义、恢复资本主义的人并不很多（这也可以看出他们的“道德面貌”），他们总是弯弯曲曲，吞吞吐吐地说话的。而在社会主义的道路和在社会主义社会里人生的道路已经确立的时候，他们提出了要“探求”，而且是照着他们的方向和目标来“探求”，谁也可以看清楚，他们是配合右派向党进攻的一个组成部分。因此，人们若问“探求者”的性质怎样，我们只能说他们是反党反社会主义的。
    反党、反社会主义，走资本主义的道路，与坚持党的领导、坚持社会主义道路，这就是两条道路的斗争，这就是阶级斗争。阶级斗争是客观存在，不是我们嗜好阶级斗争，而是剥削和压迫的阶级对被剥削、被压迫的阶级实行残酷的剥削和压迫，只有以阶级斗争来消灭阶级制度，才能最后消灭阶级斗争，才能给“思想意识的健康发展”创造真正有利的条件。所以，我们怎么能不以政治态度作为衡量人的品质的主要标准呢？分不清阶级立场，就分不清是非真伪。在这里首先就要用政治态度来衡量这一群“探求者”，才能了解“探求者”的本质，才能认清每个“探求者”的真面目。
    他们为什么会走向反党、反社会主义的道路呢？从为数不多的这几个人的政治面目也可以看出问题。有已被揭露的右派分子，有被开除党籍的分子，而主要的是一群小资产阶级知识分子的结合，他们没有改造思想，有极严重的个人主义和自由主义；他们不把文艺事业看成是党的无产阶级的革命事业，为人民服务的事业，而是看成个人成名成家向上爬，发展资产阶级个人主义，去在“文学史上留名”的事业；他们狂妄自大得什么也不放在眼内，自以为写了几篇文章、出了一两本书，就大大地骄傲起来，连党的组织也不在眼下了。其中的几个党员，公开声称党是不懂文艺的。所以他们背着党组织进行反社会主义的同人活动。并公开与党中央挑战，宣称：“我们不承认社会主义现实主义是最好的创作方法。”这就是他们的一条日益发展的严重的资产阶级文艺路线。这条反动的路线是与党的社会主义文艺路线不相容的。于是他们就把党的领导看成对他们的“教条束缚”而要加以“打破”，反对党的监督和批评，反对党的文艺路线，这也就是党的方针、政策在文艺界不能贯彻的重要原因。在整个资产阶级右派向党进攻的时期，他们趁机大肆活动，起了配合作用，这不是偶然的。
    为了保卫无产阶级文艺事业，保卫社会主义文艺路线，我们要求文艺界行动起来，深入地批判“探求者”，彻底批判其政治观点和艺术观点，开展文艺界两条道路的斗争，澄清文艺界的思想混乱，提高认识水平。这是一场严肃的政治战线上的阶级斗争，是不可调和的社会主义革命斗争。每个文艺工作者都应该投入到这个斗争里面来，并接受经验教训。只有这样，我们才能扫除社会主义文艺道路上的障碍，创造和发展社会主义的民族的新文艺，使之繁荣茂盛，光辉灿烂。
