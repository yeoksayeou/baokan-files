Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 28th: The 19th International Red Cross Conference opened here this morning. Prime Minister Nehru called on all delegates to follow the spirit of coexistence to cope with the urgent need for world peace. He said: "If we are preoccupied with the so-called Cold War, then we are mentally preoccupied with war and—worse than war—the hatred that causes war."

He welcomed the Red Cross Conference on behalf of the Indian government. He said: It is not enough to just wait for war. The correct attitude of the Red Cross at this stage should be to bring peace to the suffering in a timely manner.

More than 400 delegates representing the Red Cross Societies or governments of 83 countries attended the conference.

The Chinese government delegation and the Chinese Red Cross delegation, led by Pan Zili and Li Dequan respectively, attended the meeting.

In the conference hall, in addition to the flags of various countries, there was also the flag of the Taiwan puppet regime. Following a protest by the Chinese delegation, the Deputy Secretary of the Indian Red Cross Society, Choli, apologized to the Chinese delegation and immediately took down the flag.

Indian President Prasad pointed out in his opening speech that the focus of the conference is on banning atomic tests to protect humanity. He pointed out: "It is not reassuring to say that the harmful effects of experimental explosions have not reached any dangerous level." He believes that all delegates will handle this issue in the highest humanitarian tradition of the Red Cross.

The items on the conference agenda include: banning atomic tests, recommendations on safeguarding civilians from the dangers of all-out war, and the Red Cross as a factor in maintaining world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 28th: At the afternoon session of the 19th International Red Cross Conference today, Li Dequan, head of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, strongly protested the illegal act of the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Ponset, in inviting the Chiang Kai-shek clique to participate in the meeting. The full text of Li Dequan's speech is as follows: Mr. Chairman, Delegates:

The Chinese government delegation and the Chinese Red Cross delegation would like to raise an urgent motion to the conference regarding the proceedings of the meeting.

According to confirmed reports from many sources, Ponset, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the International Committee of the Red Cross, on October 26th, under the instruction of the U.S. delegation and disregarding the opposition of the majority of members of the Standing Committee, actually used the name of the Standing Committee to send a telegram to the Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched in Taiwan Province of the People's Republic of China, asking it to quickly send people to participate in the meeting; and members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique have already set out to participate in the meeting.

Ponset, as the chairman of an international organization, dares to abuse his power to serve the American conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and to disrupt this meeting with his intolerable attitude towards the Chinese delegation and all honest people.

The government delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Red Cross delegation now make the following suggestions to the conference: The conference severely condemns the U.S. delegation for carrying out insidious political conspiracies and Ponset's illegal acts, and demands that immediate emergency measures be taken to prohibit members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from participating in the meeting. The Chinese people and the Chinese government resolutely oppose the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." We will absolutely not participate in any international conference attended by members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

    第十九届国际红十字大会在德里开幕
    我代表团要求禁止蒋帮分子参加
    抗议常委会主席滥用职权为美国阴谋服务
    据新华社新德里28日电　在今天上午在这里开幕的第十九届国际红十字大会上，尼赫鲁总理呼吁所有代表，遵循共处的精神，来应付世界和平的迫切需要。他说：“如果我们醉心于所谓冷战，那就是我们思想上醉心于战争和——比战争更糟糕的——引起战争的仇视。”
    他代表印度政府欢迎红十字大会。他说：光是等待战争是不够的，红十字会现阶段的正确态度应当是及时为受苦者带来和平。
    参加大会的有四百多位代表，他们代表八十三个国家的红十字会或政府。
    分别由潘自力和李德全领导的中国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团参加了会议。
    在会议厅内，除了悬挂着各国的国旗以外，还挂着台湾傀儡政权的旗帜。在中国代表团抗议下，印度红十字会副秘书乔利向中国代表团道了歉，并且马上把这个旗帜摘掉。
    印度总统普拉沙德在致开幕辞时指出，大会的重点在于禁止原子试验来保护人类。他指出：“说试验性爆炸影响的害处并没有达到任何危险程度，这并不能令人安心。”他相信，所有代表都将本着红十字的最高人道主义传统精神来处理这个问题。
    大会议程中的项目有：禁止原子试验，关于保障平民防止玉石俱焚的战争的危险的建议，和红十字会作为维护世界和平的因素。
    新华社新德里28日电　在第十九届国际红十字大会今天下午的会议上，中国红十字会代表团团长李德全对红十字国际委员会常设委员会主席庞赛邀请蒋介石集团参加会议的非法行为，提出了强烈的抗议。李德全的发言全文如下：主席先生，代表们：
    中国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团就会议的进程向会议提出一个紧急动议。
    据许多方面证实的消息，红十字国际委员会常设委员会主席庞赛10月26日在美国代表团的指示下，不顾常设委员会大多数委员的反对，竟然利用常设委员会的名义，擅自拍了一个电报给盘踞在中华人民共和国台湾省的蒋介石集团，要它迅速派人来参加会议；而蒋介石集团分子已经动身前来参加会议。
    庞赛作为一个国际组织的主席，竟然胆敢滥用他的权力来为美国的制造“两个中国”的阴谋服务，并且以他对中国代表团以及一切正直人士的不能容忍的态度来扰乱这个会议。
    中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团现在向会议提出如下建议：会议严厉指责美国代表团进行阴险的政治阴谋和庞赛的非法行为，要求立即采取紧急措施禁止蒋介石集团分子参加会议。中国人民和中国政府坚决反对制造“两个中国”的阴谋。我们绝对不参加有蒋介石集团分子参加的任何国际会议。
