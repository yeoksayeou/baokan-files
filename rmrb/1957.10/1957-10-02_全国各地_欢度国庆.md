A total of 300,000 people participated in the parade in Shanghai today. Among them, 160,000 workers held up various charts and models showing production achievements to illustrate that Shanghai's production and construction during the first Five-Year Plan far exceeded that before liberation. The total industrial output value of Shanghai has nearly doubled in five years, and a large number of new products have been successfully trial-produced, including a 15,000-kilowatt steam turbine and many of the latest precision grinding machines. Steel workers have produced more than 2 million tons of steel for the motherland in the past five years; textile workers have overcome raw material difficulties and made great contributions to running enterprises through diligence and thrift. The profits turned over by State-owned Cotton Mill No. 17 alone in five years can build two all-round cotton spinning mills with 100,000 spindles.

The masses held a grand parade. More than 48,000 steel workers and construction workers walking at the front of the crowd used various charts and models to show the achievements they have made in the past five years. The steel workers refuted the fallacy put forward by the rightists that the Party cannot lead production with iron-like facts. The steel rolling workers wrote on a large steel rolling mill model "Rightists, open your eyes and see," this year the steel produced by the large steel rolling mill will increase by more than three times compared with 1954, and in September they rolled more than 4,000 tons of steel.

The workers in Guangzhou produced the most models and charts, which showed that the total industrial output value completed by the city's workers in the past five years can be increased by nearly one time. The total output of ramie cloth currently produced by the Guangdong Ramie Textile Factory has increased more than 100 times compared with five years ago.

Many veteran workers and young workers carried production figure charts with the words "Rightists, open your eyes and see!" and shouted "Long live the Communist Party!"

The charts and models of the Nanjing Automobile Parts Factory, which completed the first Five-Year Plan 24 months ahead of schedule, showed that the factory has developed from producing automobile parts to now being able to produce more than 300 kinds of new products such as motorized bicycles, engineering vehicles, rowing boats, and generators. The factory will soon produce China's first self-designed truck. The charts and models of the joint state-private Yonglining Factory showed that the factory currently produces an average of more than 500 tons of fertilizer powder per day, and the output in one year last year exceeded the total output in the 12 years before liberation. The nitrogen fertilizer they produced during the first Five-Year Plan can fertilize more than 145.5 million mu of farmland.

The charts, models, and real objects in the farmer contingent showed a scene of bumper harvest. A new farmer contingent came over carrying flails, wooden forks, and other farm tools.
