Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 4th. The National Track and Field Games will open in Nanjing on the 6th. All 740 male and female athletes from 27 delegations participating in the Games have arrived in Nanjing. This young and outstanding group of track and field athletes has largely grown up since liberation. Yi Taotelo, a Mongolian athlete from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region delegation, was a poor herdsman on the grasslands in the past and is now a long-distance running expert on the sports field. His 1,500-meter time is 4 minutes 2.6 seconds, which is close to last year's national record. Zheng Fengrong, China's famous female high jumper, won first place in the women's high jump in Democratic Germany in August with a score of 1.72 meters. This result not only broke the national record but also exceeded the second-place result in the women's high jump at the 16th Olympic Games. Jiang Yumin, a first-class athlete, is one of the fastest female athletes in China. She is the national record holder for 100, 200, and 400 meters. This year, at the 10th International Track and Field Championships in Romania, she broke the national record for the women's 200 meters with a time of 24.8 seconds.

　　In this track and field competition, Xia Xiang, vice chairman of the National Track and Field Association and professor at Tsinghua University, will serve as the chief referee, and Xu Biao and Chen Ling will serve as the deputy chief referees. All one hundred and seven referees have arrived in Nanjing.

    各地田径选手会师南京
    全国田径运动会明天开幕
    据新华社南京4日电　全国田径运动会6日在南京开幕。参加这次运动会的二十七个代表队的七百四十多名男女运动员，已经全部到达南京。这一支年轻的优秀田径选手，绝大部分是解放后成长起来的。内蒙古自治区代表队蒙古族选手伊套特洛，过去是草原上的贫苦牧民，现在已是运动场上的长跑能手，他的一千五百公尺成绩为四分二秒六，已接近去年全国纪录。我国有名的女子跳高运动健将郑凤荣，今年8月在民主德国以一点七二公尺成绩得到了女子跳高第一名，这个成绩不仅打破了全国纪录而且超过了第十六届奥林匹克运动会女子跳高第二名的成绩。一级运动员姜玉民是我国女运动员中跑得最快的一个。她是一百、二百、四百公尺的国家纪录保持者，今年在罗马尼亚第十届国际田径锦标赛中，以二十四秒八的成绩打破了女子二百公尺全国纪录。
    在这次田径比赛中，全国田径协会副主席、清华大学教授夏翔担任总裁判，徐镳、陈陵担任副总裁判。一百零七个裁判员都已到达南京。
