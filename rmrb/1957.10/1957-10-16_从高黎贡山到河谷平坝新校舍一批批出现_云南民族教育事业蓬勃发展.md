　　From the Gaoligong Mountains to River Valley Plains, New School Buildings Appear Batch After Batch
    Yunnan's Ethnic Education Flourishes
    (Our report) Yunnan Province's ethnic education has flourished. In recent years, thanks to the vigorous assistance of the Party and the People's Government in developing school education for ethnic minorities, new school buildings never seen before have appeared from the towering Gaoligong Mountains and the snow-covered Bilo Snow Mountains, from the layered Ailao Mountains to the river valley plains. Children of ethnic minorities are entering their own schools for the first time.
    Currently, Yunnan Province has established a total of 6,706 primary schools for ethnic minority children, with 398,961 ethnic minority primary school students, an increase of 94.2% compared to 1952. There are nine specialized ethnic middle schools and normal schools, and seven middle schools and normal schools where ethnic minority students account for more than half. Ethnic minority students account for more than 16% in ordinary middle schools and normal schools; ethnic minority students account for more than 25% in primary schools. According to 1956 statistics, the number of ethnic minority students in secondary technical schools has reached 821, an increase of 205% compared to 1952; the number of ethnic minority students in colleges and universities has reached 282, an increase of 286.3% compared to 1952. In the four autonomous prefectures (regions) of Dehong, Xishuangbanna, Honghe, and Nujiang, where ethnic minorities are relatively concentrated, there were almost no schools before liberation. Now, the education cause in these areas is developing from scratch, from small to large, with the number of primary school students having increased to 70,414. In the six counties of Dehong Autonomous Prefecture, there were only 36 primary schools with 719 students in 1949, and ethnic minority students accounted for only 0.71%. Now, the number of schools in this area has increased to 267, and the number of students has increased from 4,080 in 1951 to 24,266, with an average of one school per township. Three ethnic middle schools have also been established for the first time. In the Ximeng mountainous area inhabited by the Kawa ethnic group along the border, and the Nu, Nong, Dulong, and Kucong ethnic groups with the smallest populations living in the primitive forests of the Nujiang and Honghe River basins, there was not a single school or student before liberation. Now, their children have also entered the school gates. In the past, there was a saying circulating on the south bank of the Honghe River: "Ants do not cross the river, partridges do not go up trees, and Bula do not study." Today, the Bula ethnic group not only has more than 500 children enrolled in school, but also has six middle school students.
    In recent years, the Party and the government have also allocated special funds to help develop ethnic education based on the conditions of various ethnic minorities. In 1952, more than 720,000 yuan was allocated, and this year's allocation has more than doubled compared to 1952. In some ethnic minority areas with relatively poor living conditions, schools have been established in such a way that the government takes care of everything from the construction of school buildings to the students' clothing and food. In order to meet the needs of the development of ethnic education, the relevant departments have paid special attention to the training of ethnic minority teachers in recent years. At present, there are two ethnic normal schools in the province, with 600 students from more than a dozen ethnic groups. In addition, many ethnic minority teachers have been trained through various methods such as running training courses.

　　从高黎贡山到河谷平坝新校舍一批批出现
    云南民族教育事业蓬勃发展
    本报讯　云南省民族教育事业有了蓬勃发展。几年来，由于党和人民政府大力帮助少数民族发展学校教育，从高耸入云的高黎贡山、白雪皑皑的碧罗雪山，峰峦层叠的哀牢山上到河谷平坝，出现了一幢幢从未见过的新校舍，少数民族的子女们第一次踏进了自己的学校。
    目前，云南省已为少数民族儿童设立了小学共六千七百零六所，民族小学生共有三十九万八千九百六十一人，比1952年增加了94.2％。专设的民族中学及师范学校共九所，民族学生占半数以上的中学和师范学校七所。在普通中学和师范学校中少数民族学生已占16％强；小学校中民族学生占25％强。据1956年统计，中等技术学校民族学生已达八百二十一人，比1952年增加205％；大专学校民族学生已达二百八十二人，比1952年增加286.3％。在少数民族较集中的德宏、西双版纳、红河、怒江等四个自治州（区），解放前几乎没有学校，现在这些地区的教育事业正在从无到有、从小到大地发展着，小学生已发展到七万零四百一十四人，德宏自治州的边六县，1949年仅有小学三十六所，学生七百一十九人，民族学生只占0.71％。现在，这个地区的学校已增加到二百六十七所，学生由1951年的四千零八十人增加到二万四千二百六十六人，而且平均每乡已有一所学校。并创立了从未有过的三所民族中学。在国境边沿佧佤族聚居的西盟山区和居住在怒江、红河流域的原始丛林中人数最少的怒、侬、独龙、苦聪等民族，解放前没有一所学校和一个学生，现在他们的子女也踏进了校门。过去红河南岸流传着“蚂蚁不过河，鹧鸪不上树，卜拉不读书”的谚语，如今卜拉族不仅有五百多个儿童入学，还有了六个中学生。
    几年来，党和政府还根据各地少数民族的情况拨专款帮助发展民族教育事业。1952年就拨出七十二万多元，今年拨款又比1952年增加了一倍多。在一些生活较贫困的民族地区，采取了从兴建校舍直到学生的穿衣吃饭等都全部由政府包下来的办法办学校。为了适应民族教育发展的需要，几年来有关部门特别注意了民族师资的培养工作。现在全省已有两所民族师范学校，有十几种民族的六百名学生。此外，各地还通过开办训练班等方式培养了很多民族师资。
