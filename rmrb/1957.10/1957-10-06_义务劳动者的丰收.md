    The Fruitful Harvest of Voluntary Laborers
    The suburbs of Beijing have yielded a bountiful harvest. Recently, middle schools throughout Beijing have generally been granted agricultural leave, sending students to various agricultural cooperatives to participate in voluntary labor, assisting farmers with the harvest. The labor enthusiasm of the young men and women has earned the farmers' praise. Before the heavy rain a few days ago, previous labor efforts, such as picking cotton, breaking corn, and threshing sorghum... all ensured that the harvested crops were stored in advance, avoiding potential losses, which further highlighted its direct impact.
    The voluntary laborers themselves also experienced their own "harvest."
    Some "scholars" who were unaccustomed to physical labor and knew nothing about agriculture experienced the hardship and glory of labor firsthand, fundamentally changing their past attitudes of belittling physical labor and agricultural production. They truly recognized the glory of farmers providing food for the people of the whole country and guaranteeing socialist construction through their labor. They expressed that if they could not pass the university entrance exam, they would participate in agricultural production and become the first generation of educated farmers.
    Voluntary labor has also cultivated and tempered the students' spirit of hard work and plain living. In the past, waste was rampant in school cafeterias, with students throwing away steamed buns and scattering rice grains. Through this physical labor, fair public opinion has formed. A table of eight students scattering twenty grains of rice has become the focus of school-wide criticism.
    Returning from the countryside, the students have become more aware of the superiority of cooperation, receiving a vivid and rich political lesson. While performing voluntary labor, many schools invited responsible comrades from the agricultural cooperatives to give reports to the students and organized students to visit emancipated farmers. For example, students from the 65th Middle School visited Guo Delin of the Guangming Cooperative in the eastern suburbs. This old farmer, who had begged for more than thirty years in the old society and suffered from hunger and persecution, used his own life experience to confirm the improvement in the lives of farmers under the leadership of the Party. He said: "The right-wing elements say that the farmers' lives have deteriorated, which is complete nonsense. In the past, I begged for food and lived in cave dwellings. Now I eat my fill, wear warm clothes, and even have savings. All of this was given to me by the Party and Chairman Mao." This clear class sentiment powerfully struck back at the right-wing elements and educated the students. Upon returning from labor, the students reflected that the benefits of this physical labor were endless, and they hoped to organize more activities like this in the future.

### 义务劳动者的丰收

    义务劳动者的丰收
    京郊丰收了。近些日子，北京市各个中学普遍放了农忙假，分别到各农业社去参加义务劳动，协助农民收获。姑娘们和小伙子们的劳动热情，博得了农民的赞许。前几天下了一场大雨，在这以前的一些劳动，像是摘棉花，掰棒子、打高粱……都使得收获品提前贮藏起来，避免了可能发生的损失，就更显出它的直接效果。
    义务劳动者本人也有自己的“丰收”。
    一些四体不勤、五谷不分的“学子”，切身地体会劳动的艰苦和光荣，根本改变了过去轻视体力劳动，轻视农业生产的思想。他们真真地认识农民们以自己的劳动供给全国人民粮食、保证社会主义的建设的光荣。他们表示如果考不上大学就去参加农业生产，作一个第一代有文化的农民。
    义务劳动也培养和锻炼了学生们的艰苦朴素的作风。过去学校食堂里，学生吃饭时扔馒头、撒饭粒的浪费现象很严重，通过这次体力劳动，公正的舆论形成了。八个人一桌吃，撒掉了二十个米粒，已经是全校注目的批评对象了。
    学生们从农村回来，更加认识到合作化的优越性，上了一堂生动丰富的政治课。在义务劳动的同时，不少学校都邀请了农业社的负责同志给学生作了报告，组织学生访问了翻身农民。例如六十五中学生就访问了东郊光明社的郭德林。这位曾经在旧社会讨过三十多年饭、饱受饥寒迫害的老农民，以自己的生活经历证实了在党领导下的农民生活的改善。他说：“右派分子说农民生活降低了，真是胡扯。过去我讨饭吃，住窑洞，现在我吃得饱，穿得暖，还有存款。这都是党和毛主席给的。这种鲜明的阶级感情，有力地打击了右派分子，教育了学生。学生们劳动归来，纷纷反映，这次体力劳动对他们的好处是说不完的，他们希望以后多组织这样的活动。
