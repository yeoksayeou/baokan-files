Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: Polish News Agency reported on the 5th that the Warsaw Police Chief, Lieutenant Colonel Kozlowski, explained the events of the riots in Warsaw on October 3rd and 4th to reporters in Warsaw.

Kozlowski mentioned that on October 3rd, a group of students gathered at Narutowicz Square without permission from the relevant authorities. The police repeatedly asked them to disperse and go home, but to no avail. Insulting boos and shouts were heard from the nearby student dormitories, and stones were thrown. Subsequently, someone threw three explosives at the police, at which point the police used rubber batons and tear gas to stop the riots.

Then, more and more thugs mixed into the crowd, and the police were forced to take swift action.

He went on to say that afterward, leaflets with the words "Warsaw Students" were distributed around the city, spreading provocative rumors that dozens of students had been detained. In fact, the police only detained eight students on October 3rd, three of whom were carrying smoke bombs and smoke canisters.

Regarding the riots on October 4th, Kozlowski pointed out that at six o'clock in the afternoon of that day, a group of students from the Warsaw University of Technology, disregarding the principal's ban, gathered in the hall of the college without permission. At the same time, groups of fierce young people began marching towards the Central Committee Building of the Polish United Workers' Party. The worker police force and regular police force together dispersed them and detained a dozen or so fierce youths who were throwing stones.

As the students left the hall, thugs massed in the streets began attacking the police with stones, and the police were forced to use smoke canisters and tear gas to stop the riots. Subsequently, groups of thugs marched towards Constitution Square, attempting to attack the police there, but were dispersed. Order was restored after dusk.

    华沙民警司令谈
    华沙骚乱经过
    据新华社6日讯　波兰通讯社5日报道，华沙民警司令科兹洛夫斯基中校向华沙的记者说明了10月3日和4日华沙发生的骚乱事件的情况。
    科兹洛夫斯基谈到，10月3日，一群学生未经有关当局许可，擅自在纳鲁托维兹广场集会。民警多次要求他们解散回家，但无效果。附近的学生宿舍内发出了侮辱民警的嘘声和喊声，并且投掷石头。随后又有人向民警扔出了三个爆炸物，这时，民警才用橡皮短棒和催泪弹来制止骚乱。
    接着，混入人群中的暴徒越来越多，民警被迫采取了迅速行动。
    他接着谈到，事后，城里有人散发署有“华沙学生”字样的传单，散布挑衅性的谣言，说有几十名学生被拘留。事实上民警在10月3日只拘留了八个学生，其中三人带有烟幕弹和烟幕罐。
    关于10月4日的骚乱事件，科兹洛夫斯基指出，这一天的下午六时，华沙理工学院的一群学生不顾校长的禁止，擅自在这个学院的大厅集会。同时，成群的凶暴的青年开始走向波兰统一工人党中央委员会大厦。工人民警队和正规民警队一起驱散了他们，并且拘留了十几个气势汹汹扔石头的青年。
    在学生离开大厅的时候，麇集在大街上的暴徒开始用石头攻击民警，民警被迫使用了烟幕罐和催泪性瓦斯来制止骚乱。随后，成群暴徒走向宪法广场，企图在那里攻击民警，但被驱散。黄昏后恢复秩序。
