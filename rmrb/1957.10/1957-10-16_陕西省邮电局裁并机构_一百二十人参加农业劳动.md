The Shaanxi Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, based on the principles of streamlining staffing, reducing cadres, and transferring these cadres to the labor front and grassroots positions, recently carried out institutional streamlining work. It was decided to eliminate four sections and offices, reducing the number of cadres by 536, accounting for more than half of the bureau's total staff. These reduced cadres will be transferred to rural areas to participate in agricultural production and be assigned to grassroots work. According to statistics at the end of September, 120 people have already returned to the agricultural front to participate in labor, and another 289 people have taken on practical jobs such as delivery, line work, telephone operation, and business operations.

    陕西省邮电局裁并机构
    一百二十人参加农业劳动
    本报讯　陕西省邮电管理局根据紧缩编制减少干部，并把这些干部输送到劳动战线上和基层工作岗位上的原则，最近进行了裁并机构的工作，决定裁并四个科和室，减少干部五百三十六名，占全局人数一半以上。这些减少的干部将分别输送到农村参加农业生产和下放到基层工作。据9月底统计，已有一百二十人回到农业战线上参加劳动，还有二百八十九人担任了投递、线务、话务、营业等实际工作。
