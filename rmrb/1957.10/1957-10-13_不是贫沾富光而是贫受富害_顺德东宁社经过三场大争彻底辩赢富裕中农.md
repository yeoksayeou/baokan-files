　　It's Not the Poor Taking Advantage of the Rich, but the Poor Suffering from the Rich
　　Dongning Cooperative in Shunde Thoroughly Defeats Prosperous Middle Peasants After Three Major Debates
　　(According to a report from the Southern Daily) After the great blooming and contending in Yang'e Township, Shunde County, Guangdong Province, the Dongning Cooperative actively improved its work based on the opinions of its members, and submitted major issues of right and wrong to the members for free discussion. Through laying out the facts, reasoning, and fully developing democracy, the cooperative clarified the major issues of right and wrong in collectivization, and the socialist consciousness of the vast majority of the members was raised.
　　The Dongning Agricultural Production Cooperative was a third-class cooperative. Last year, due to poor production, the entire cooperative experienced a reduction in output. Therefore, after the autumn harvest distribution, some prosperous middle peasants took the lead in causing a wave of withdrawals from the cooperative, inciting members to apply for withdrawal from the cooperative at the county level. After education, although the wave of withdrawals subsided, the ideological problems were not completely resolved, and some prosperous middle peasants rarely attended work. During this great blooming and contending, the issue of reduced production became their main target of attack. Chen Hua, a prosperous middle peasant and member of the cooperative committee, said: "In my opinion, cooperatives are chaotic because there are too many people and not enough hands, and they definitely cannot be run well. After collectivization, farmers only experience 'three declines'. The first decline is that members' incomes have decreased; the second decline is that members' freedom has been restricted; and the third decline is that they work hard but receive less income." He also said: "Everyone knows that before I joined the cooperative, I earned more than 80,000 catties of sugarcane every year, which alone amounted to more than 1,000 yuan, not counting raising fish and silkworms. But after joining the cooperative, my income is less than half of what it used to be." Many prosperous middle peasants agreed with this opinion. He He said: "Collectivization did come too quickly. It's a lie to say the cooperative is good. At least 70% of the members in our cooperative have reduced their income." He even spread out his hands to everyone and said: "May I ask, is there anyone here whose income has increased?" Some poor peasants even agreed with this opinion.
　　Who's Freedom Has the Cooperative Restricted? Who Has Affected the Cooperative's Increased Production?
　　After this "three declines" issue was raised, it immediately became the center of discussion among the masses. Some people agreed with this opinion, while others disagreed. In order to distinguish right from wrong, the cooperative decided to submit these issues to the members for discussion. The poor peasant Zhou Hui humorously said: "Chen Hua said that he worked harder after joining the cooperative than he used to, and I think that's right. But, may I ask, how did he get the 80,000 catties of sugarcane he earned each year before joining the cooperative? Has he ever taken off his shoes to work in the sugarcane fields? From planting sugarcane and scooping mud to cutting sugarcane, we were all hired to do it for him. He only did some light work. Indeed, his income was high and he didn't have to work hard, because all the hard work fell on those of us who worked for him."
　　After Zhou Hui said this, some members who had worked for Chen Hua immediately thought of the issue of "lack of freedom after joining the cooperative" that Chen Hua had mentioned. They said: "Chen Hua indeed doesn't have as much freedom as he did when he was working individually. First, after joining the cooperative, he can only be paid according to his labor, and he can no longer freely hire workers like he used to; second, taking the spontaneous road is not as free as it used to be; and third, he can't freely change crops either." Some people also said: "I think he's still too free. He doesn't engage in the cooperative's production and only focuses on his own sideline businesses, and then he complains that he doesn't get enough." This hit the nail on the head for those with capitalist ideas. Tang Su, a well-known advisor among the prosperous middle peasants, immediately stood up to defend them. He said: "Blame it on the cooperative for distributing so little. People who engage in sideline businesses earn more money. If you have the ability, you can do it too! Everyone has this freedom."
　　Tang Su's defense led to the question of why the cooperative distributed so little. Many members who attended work more actively immediately stood up to refute him, saying: "It's precisely because you people are selfish and only care about your own interests, and have ruined the cooperative's production, that the value of labor days has been lowered, which has resulted in the actively attending members suffering losses." They also presented the facts: For example, the fourth production team of the cooperative, with more than 60 households, was composed entirely of poor and lower-middle peasants, except for three prosperous middle peasant households. The sugarcane fields they were responsible for cultivating were the thinnest, farthest, and most scattered in the entire cooperative. However, because they were conscientious and responsible, and wholeheartedly focused on improving production, their attendance was the most active. As a result, in the context of the overall reduction in production in the cooperative last year, their team increased production by 30%. Their production this year is also the best. Conversely, the fifth production team had the most fertile land and the best natural conditions, and was also close to the village. However, because middle peasants accounted for the majority of this team, and capitalist ideas were more serious, everyone only cared about their own sideline businesses. As a result, the entire team's sugarcane production decreased by 30% last year. Once this fact was presented, no one dared to say that the reduction in income last year was because the cooperative was not good.
　　Demanding Contracted Production to Households is to Take the Road Backwards
　　The arguments that the cooperative had "three declines" were refuted one by one. But Li Wei, a prosperous middle peasant, said: "Collectivization is not bad. If it were really bad, Chairman Mao would not have proposed it. However, if we want to run our cooperative well, we must implement contracted production to households. First, contracted production to households can strengthen members' sense of responsibility and avoid chaos in production; second, it can guarantee increased production and income for members, and members' enthusiasm will be improved; third, members can also be relatively free and arrange their own production time; fourth, there will be no 'living clams dragging down dead clams,' and each will be responsible for their own profits and losses, and no one will take advantage of anyone else." As soon as this opinion was raised, it was immediately supported by many prosperous middle peasants. He Xingfu was the first to say: "Li Wei is right. The only way to strengthen members' sense of responsibility and improve production is to implement contracted production to households. To be honest, I was full of energy when I was working individually; when I joined the mutual aid team, I only did 80% of the work; and after joining the cooperative, I only did 50% or 60% of the work. I guarantee that contracted production to households will definitely be able to complete the prescribed output." Liu Ming then said: "Not only can I guarantee the completion of the output, but I can also set aside some land and plant whatever crop has a high price." Zou Sao also put forward specific suggestions, advocating that the original land be divided back to each household, and that fish ponds, mulberry fields, and sugarcane fields also be divided to each household. The cooperative's leadership structure could remain unchanged, and members would pay rent to the cooperative, which would uniformly pay public grain and water conservancy grain. He also patted the cooperative director Huang Qin on the shoulder happily and said: "You, you don't have to worry anymore, you'll get rich soon." Even Huang Tian, a poor peasant and member of the cooperative committee, was misled, thinking that this would indeed save the trouble of arranging work every day.
　　However, many poor and lower-middle peasants became anxious. Mai Di said: "This will be the death of us." Feng Yin'er said: "If contracted production to households is implemented, unless the cooperative prepares a few baskets of grain to help us, we will definitely starve to death." The poor peasant Zhou Hui also said: "Contracted production to households is good for the middle peasants who want to get rich individually, but it only leads to a dead end for the poor peasants." He cited the facts, saying: "My production team has eleven households and more than 40 mu of sugarcane fields, but only four boats and two mud-scooping baskets. These farm tools belong to the prosperous middle peasants. How can members who lack farm tools and labor do contracted production to households?" The poor peasant He Jingxin anxiously grabbed the clothes of the work team cadre and said: "Please help us quickly, doing this will force people to death." The work team cadres suggested that they consider it carefully and continue the discussion the next day. As a result, it triggered the second major debate.
　　As soon as they heard that they were discussing the issue of "contracted production to households," even the old ladies came to participate with their walking sticks. Would contracted production to households strengthen the sense of responsibility and improve production? The poor peasant Liang Wei was the first to refute, saying: "If it is said that contracted production to households can enhance the sense of responsibility and improve production, then why are there so many individual households that cannot do well in production?" He cited an example: He Qipei, an individual household and prosperous middle peasant, abandoned two mu of sugarcane land this year because he only focused on speculative trading. He said: "Contracted production to households is actually individual work, taking the road backwards." The poor peasant Luo Lan then revealed the purpose of Zou Sao's proposal to bring back the original land for contracted production to households. She said: "Last year, the Dongning Cooperative had a wave of withdrawals, and Zou Sao went everywhere to mobilize members to sign their names. This time, he wants to contract production by households and bring back the original land, but in reality, he wants to hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat, take back his own fish ponds to raise fish, and then sell them to us at high prices under the cooperative's signboard." Following this, many members pointed out that contracted production to households would inevitably bring four major harms: First, the phenomenon of polarization would reappear, and members who lacked farm tools and labor would go bankrupt, which would only benefit a small number of prosperous middle peasants, but even they would not be insured. Second, it would increase chaos in operation and management, and the cooperative would not be able to check and supervise production. Third, it would further encourage the prosperous middle peasants to take the capitalist road. Fourth, it would be detrimental to unity within the cooperative. The poor peasant Zhou Hui also stood in the middle of the meeting place and refuted, saying: "The so-called contracted production to households can enhance members' sense of responsibility is nonsense. Only members who do not love the cooperative will cut corners and not attend work." Many women pointed at Zou Sao and others and asked: "Are your proposals intended to smash our rice bowls?"
　　Is it the Poor Taking Advantage of the Rich? Or the Rich Taking Advantage of the Poor?
　　Because the proposal of contracted production to households was seen through by the masses and opposed by the majority of members, especially the poor peasants, those few prosperous middle peasant households had to admit that this proposal was wrong. However, He Xingfu, a prosperous middle peasant, was still not convinced. He targeted the argument that contracted production to households would cause most people to suffer losses and said: "Although collectivization is good for most people, living clams drag down dead clams, and in the end, it is the prosperous middle peasants who suffer losses." Someone asked him: "How do you suffer losses?" He said: "Before joining the cooperative, prosperous middle peasants had good land, a lot of capital, and strong labor. After joining the cooperative, everything is leveled out, isn't that the poor peasants taking advantage of the prosperous middle peasants?" He He added from the side: "When I think about this issue, I am so heartbroken that I can't sleep!"
　　As soon as they said this, the poor peasants started discussing again. Some thought that they were indeed taking advantage of the prosperous middle peasants, such as the poor peasant Mai Di, who said: "Before I joined the cooperative, I only had two thin fields, and they mostly had good fields and good ponds when they joined the cooperative." Therefore, she dared not refute. Some also just said: "It's collectivization! It's the Communist Party! It's inevitable that some advantage will be taken." At this time, Zhou Hui, the poor peasant who had been tempered by several ideological clashes, stood up righteously and said: "I don't agree with He Xingfu's saying that poor peasants took advantage of the prosperous middle peasants. Before liberation, although poor peasants and prosperous middle peasants were also exploited and oppressed by landlords together, the prosperous middle peasants had more capital and often undermined the poor peasants (seized their cultivated land). Therefore, the land they occupied was mostly good. After liberation, during the land reform, the poor peasants were the most active in fighting the landlords and contributed the most. But when the land was distributed, the prosperous middle peasants did not move their original cultivated land, which was already a big advantage. Before collectivization, we poor peasants had no capital, but the prosperous middle peasants speculated on fish seedlings and sold them to us at high prices. When we raised the fish to almost a pound, just when they were growing meat, we had to sell them to the prosperous middle peasants at low prices because we lacked capital. In this way, they also took a lot of advantage of us. After collectivization, we contributed to the cooperative's fund, actively attended work, and tried to find ways to run the cooperative well. But you (referring to He Xingfu) only put five or six percent of your effort into the cooperative, and were attached to individual work, engaged in spontaneity, and dragged down the cooperative's production, lowering the value of labor days. As a result, we worked harder, contributed more to the cooperative's accumulation of public funds, and even paid the country's public grain obligations for you who didn't attend work. How can you say that we poor peasants took advantage of you? It should be said the other way around!"
　　After Zhou Hui said this, the poor peasants felt that the truth was on their side, and their backs straightened up. Someone used an analogy, saying: "Joining the cooperative is like sitting in a boat. The poor peasants are desperately rowing, while those who engage in spontaneity are sitting in the boat half-heartedly, who is really taking advantage?" At this time, He Xingfu and others could no longer offer any reason to argue.

　　不是贫沾富光而是贫受富害
    顺德东宁社经过三场大争彻底辩赢富裕中农
    据南方日报消息　广东省顺德县羊额乡东宁社在大鸣大放之后，一方面根据社员的意见，积极改进工作，一方面把大是大非的问题，提交社员自由讨论。通过摆事实、讲道理，充分发扬民主，辩明了合作化问题的大是大非，绝大多数社员的社会主义觉悟有了提高。
    东宁农业生产合作社是个三类社。去年因生产没有搞好，全社减产，因此在秋收分配以后，一些富裕中农就带头闹起退社风潮，煽动社员到县里申请退社。经过教育以后，退社风潮虽然平息下来了，但思想问题还没有彻底解决，有些富裕中农虽然没有退社，却很少出勤。到这次大鸣大放的时候，这个减产问题，就成了他们攻击的主要目标。富裕中农的社委陈华说：“依我看，合作社人多手脚乱，肯定是无法办好的。合作化后，只给农民带来‘三衰’，第一衰是社员减少了收入；第二衰是限制了社员的自由；第三衰是辛苦还收入的少。”他还说：“大家都知道啦，我入社前每年都收入八万多斤甘蔗，仅这一项就有一千多元收入，养鱼、养蚕还不算。可是入社后，收入还不及过去一半。”这个意见，不少富裕中农都同意。何和说：“合作化确实来得太快了，说社好是骗人的，我们社里起码有七成人减少收入。”他还摊开手向大家说：“请问在座有那个增加收入的？”甚至有些贫农也同意了这个意见。
　　社限制了谁的自由？谁影响了社的增产？
    这个“三衰”问题提出来后，立即就成了群众议论的中心，有人对这个意见表示同意，也有人表示不同意。为了分清是非，社里决定把这些问题提交社员讨论。贫农周辉幽默地说：“陈华说他入社后比过去辛苦，我看是对的。但是，试问他入社前一年收入的八万斤甘蔗是怎样得来的呢？他脱过鞋到蔗地做过工吗？从种蔗、戽泥到砍蔗，都是雇我们替他做的，他只是做些轻工。”这样确实是收入又多又不辛苦，因为辛苦都落在我们替他做工的人身上了。”
    周辉这样一说，有些给陈华做过工的社员马上联想到陈华说的“入社不自由”的问题来了。他们说：“陈华入了社，的确没单干时那样自由了，第一，他入了社只能按劳取酬，再也不能像过去那样自由雇工了；第二，走自发的道路也不如过去那样自由了；第三，也不能自由改种了。”有些人又说：“我看他还是太自由了，不搞社的生产，专搞自己的副业，还说分得少。”这一说，打中了那些具有资本主义思想的人的要害。富裕中农中有名的师爷唐苏马上起来辩护了。他说：“鬼叫社预分少，人家搞副业赚钱多，你们有本事也可以去做呀！谁也有这个自由。”
    唐苏这样一辩，倒把社为什么分得少这个问题引出来了。许多出勤比较积极的社员立刻起来反驳他说：“正是你们这些人自私自利，顾私不顾公，搞坏了社的生产，才使劳动日值拉低，结果使积极出勤的社员吃了亏。”他们还摆出了事实：如该社的第四生产队，全队六十多户人，除三户富裕中农外，其余全是贫农和下中农。他们负责耕种的蔗基是全社最瘦、最远、最分散的，但是，由于他们认真负责，一心把生产搞好，出勤最积极，结果，在去年全社减产的情况下，他们队却增产了三成。今年生产也是该队最好。反之，第五生产队的土地最肥，自然条件也最好，又近村边，但由于这个队中农占多数，资本主义思想比较严重，大家都只顾搞自己的副业，结果去年全队的甘蔗却减产了三成。这个事实一摆出来，再也没有人敢说去年减收是因为社不好了。
　　要求包产到户，就是要走回头路
    说合作社“三衰”的论点一一被驳倒了。但富裕中农李伟却说：“合作化不是不好，如果真是不好，毛主席就不会提出来了。不过，要想办好我们的社，就一定要包产到户。第一，包产到户能加强社员的责任心，避免生产上的混乱；第二，能够保证社员增产增收，社员积极性会提高；第三，社员也可以比较自由，自己安排生产时间；第四，不会‘生蛤拉死蛤’，各负盈亏，互不揩油。”这个意见一提出来，马上就获得不少富裕中农的拥护，何星甫首先说：“李伟提得对，加强社员责任心搞好生产的唯一办法就是包产到户。老实说，我在单干时劲头十足；参加互助组只做八成工夫；入社呢，只做五、六成工夫。我担保，包产到户一定能完成规定产量。”刘明接着说：“我不但能保证完成产量，还可以抽出一些土地，看那样作物价高，就种那样。”邹骚还提出了具体的建议，主张把原有土地分回给各户，鱼塘、桑基、蔗地也都分给户，社的领导机构可以不变，社员给社交租金，由社统一交公粮、水利谷。他还兴高采烈地拍着社主任黄勤的肩膀说：“你呀，今后再不用操心，很快就会肥起来的了。”甚至贫农社委黄添也给迷惑住了，认为这样做确实可以省去天天排工的麻烦。
    可是，不少贫农下中农却焦急起来了。麦娣说：“这样就苦死我们了。”冯银二说：“实行包产到户，除非社准备几箩谷救济我们，否则必然饿死。”贫农周辉也说：“包到户，想搞个人发财的中农就好，贫农只有死路一条。”他举出事实说：“我的生产组十一户人，四十多亩蔗地，只有四只艇，两个戽泥篸，这些农具都是富裕中农的，包产到户叫那些缺农具缺劳动力的社员怎样办？”贫农何静心急得扯着工作队干部的衣服说：“你们快些帮口吧，这样做就要逼死人了。”工作队的干部建议他们好好考虑，第二天继续讨论。结果，引起了第二场大辩论。
    一听说是讨论“包产到户”的问题，连老太婆也扶着手杖来参加了。是否包产到户就能加强责任心搞好生产呢？贫农梁伟首先提出反驳说：“如果说包产到户能增强责任心搞好生产，那么，为什么却有这么多单干户搞不好生产呢？”他举例说：单干户、富裕中农何其沛，今年就是因为只顾做投机买卖，丢荒了二亩蔗地。他说：“包产到户，实际上就是单干，走回头路。”贫农罗兰接着揭露了邹骚提出带回原有土地包产到户的目的。她说：“去年东宁社闹退社风波，邹骚到处发动社员签名，这回他要以户包产，带回原有土地，实则是想挂羊头卖狗肉，取回自己的鱼塘养鱼花，然后挂着社的招牌，高价卖给我们。”跟着，许多社员都指出，包产到户必然带来四大害处：第一，重新出现两极分化的现象，缺农具，缺劳动力的社员就会破产，只有对小部分富裕中农有利，但也不保险。第二，增加经营管理上的混乱，社无法检查督促生产。第三，更加助长了富裕中农走资本主义道路。第四，不利于社内团结。贫农周辉还站在会场的中间驳斥说：“所谓包产到户才能增强社员的责任心是一派胡言，只有不爱社的社员才偷工减料和不出勤。”许多妇女都指着邹骚等人问：“你们的主张，是不是想打烂我们的饭碗？”
　　究竟贫沾富光？还是富沾贫光？
    由于包产到户这个主张给群众识穿，遭到大多数社员特别是贫农的反对，那几户富裕中农不得不承认这个主张不对。但富裕中农何星甫依然不服气。他针对包产到户大多数人吃亏这个论点说：“合作化虽则是对大多数人好，但是生蛤拖死蛤，终归是富裕中农吃亏。”有人问他：“怎样吃亏呢？”他说：“入社前，富裕中农土地好、资金多、劳动力强，入社后一拉平，还不是贫农揩富裕中农的油水？”何和更在旁边说：“提到这个问题，真是伤心到睡都睡不着了！”
    他们这么一说，贫农又议论纷纷了。有的认为确是揩了富裕中农的油，如贫农麦娣说：“我入社前只得两条瘦基，他们入社大都是好基好塘。”因此不敢驳。有些也只是说：“合作化嘛！共产党嘛！少不了要揩点油的了。”这个时候，经过几次思想交锋锻炼出来的贫农周辉，却理直气壮地站起来说：“我不同意何星甫说贫农揩了富裕中农油水。解放前，贫农和富裕中农虽然也一起受地主剥削压迫，但富裕中农本钱大，经常挖贫农的墙脚（夺耕），因此占有土地大都是好的；解放后，搞土地改革，贫农斗地主最积极，出力最大；但分土地时，富裕中农是按原耕地不动，已经占了不少便宜。合作化前，我们贫农没本钱，富裕中农却炒卖鱼花，高价卖给我们，当我们把鱼养到快一斤重，正是长肉的时候，因为缺乏本钱，又只得贱价卖给富裕中农，这样他们又揩了我们不少油。合作化后，我们一样交入社基金，积极出勤想办法把社办好；而你呢（指何星甫），只放五六成力量在社，留恋单干，搞自发，拖坏了社的生产，拉低了劳动日价值。结果，我们劳动得多，为社积累公积金出力大，连国家的公粮义务，也替你们不出勤的人负担了，怎能说我们贫农揩了你们的油水呢？要说，倒过来说才对呢！”
    经周辉这么一说，贫农觉得道理是在自己这一边，腰马上硬了起来。有人打个比喻说：“我们入社如同坐一条船，贫农拚命出力划，搞自发的却半心半意坐在船上轻摇，究竟是谁占便宜呢？”这时，何星甫等人再也提不出什么道理来争辩了。
