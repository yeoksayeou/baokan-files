Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 20th: “How the World Has Changed in Forty Years” – under this general title, the recently published "Propagandist's Handbook" has published a wealth of materials illustrating the changes in the world's face since the October Socialist Revolution.

The magazine points out that the growing strength of the socialist camp, the increasing disintegration of the colonial system, and the growing popularity of communist ideas are the trends of the world's changes over the past forty years.

The socialist camp now occupies more than a quarter of the world's land. One out of every three people in the world lives in a socialist country. The total territory of socialist countries accounts for two-thirds of the entire territory of Asia and Europe, which is twice as much as the total territory of the United States and all European capitalist countries combined. The population of socialist countries accounts for about half of the population of Asia and Europe, which is 2.6 times more than the population of the United States, Britain, and France combined. Socialist countries produce one-third of the world's industrial products and 40% of the world's total grain output.

The rate of national economic development in the Soviet Union and all other socialist countries has surpassed that of the most developed capitalist countries. In the past five years, the growth rate of industrial production in socialist countries has been 1.6 times faster than that of capitalist countries. Last year, the socialist camp produced approximately 70 million tons of steel, an increase of 1.8 times compared to the pre-World War II annual steel production of these countries; produced 970 million tons of coal, an increase of 1.5 times compared to pre-war levels; and produced 295 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, an increase of three times compared to pre-war levels.

In terms of improving labor productivity, increasing national income, and raising workers' real wages, socialist countries are superior to capitalist countries in every way.

The "Propagandist's Handbook" also points out that the great October Socialist Revolution pointed out the path to liberation from the shackles of imperialism for the colonial people. In the past twelve years, more than 1.3 billion people (half of the world's total population) have been liberated from their colonial vassal status. After World War II, more than twenty new independent countries were established on former colonial lands. In 1939, 1.5 billion people lived in colonies and dependent countries, accounting for 66% of the world's total population. Now, that number has dropped to only 160 million.

The United States is now the largest stronghold of world colonialism. Britain still possesses colonies with six million square kilometers and more than 80 million people. France still has colonies with more than ten million square kilometers and 42 million people. Belgium and Portugal also still possess many colonies. However, the course of history has completely affirmed the complete collapse of the colonial system.

The "Propagandist's Handbook" points out that the forty years since the October Socialist Revolution have been forty years of the victory of Marxism-Leninism and communist ideas. On the eve of the October Revolution in 1917, there were no more than 250,000 communist party members in all of Russia. At the beginning of World War II, there were communist parties in forty-three countries, including the Soviet Union, with a total of 4.2 million members. At the end of World War II, the number of countries with communist and workers' parties increased to seventy-six, with a total membership of over 20 million. Now, the total number of communist party members in various countries around the world has exceeded 33 million. The Communist and Workers' Parties of thirteen socialist countries have become ruling parties. In capitalist countries, there are now sixty-three communist parties with a total membership of approximately five million (excluding those imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps); in more than thirty countries, the Communist Party is forced to operate illegally. In countries such as the United States, Argentina, and Mexico, the Communist Party works in a semi-legal state.

The prestige of communist parties in various countries is constantly increasing. For example, by the beginning of this year, the Italian Communist Party had more than two million members, the French Communist Party had approximately 430,000 members, and the Indonesian Communist Party, when it became a legal party in 1945, had only 3,000 members, but now it has increased to approximately 1.6 million. The influence of the Indian Communist Party is also growing, winning 12 million votes in this year's parliamentary elections and forming a government led by the Communist Party in Kerala.

Over the past forty years, the world's trade union movement has grown increasingly strong. In 1914, the world's trade unions had a total of 13 million members, which has now increased to 160 million, of which more than 90 million belong to the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The struggle of the working class in capitalist countries has become stronger and more vigorous. If, in the ten years before World War II, the number of people participating in strikes in eleven capitalist countries was 21 million, then in the ten years after the war, the number of strikers in these countries has increased to 73 million.

The power of the world peace movement and the women's and youth movements is also very strong now.

After narrating these facts, the "Propagandist's Handbook" points out that the forty years since the great October Socialist Revolution prove that the death of capitalism is inevitable, the future belongs to socialism, and the working people of all countries around the world support socialism. Socialism will be established worldwide.

    十月革命四十年
    世界面貌大改变
    苏联“宣传鼓动员手册”发表许多材料
    据新华社莫斯科20日电  “四十年来世界在怎样变化”——这里最近出版的“宣传鼓动员手册”在这一总标题下发表了许多材料，说明十月社会主义革命以来世界面貌的改变。
    这家杂志指出，社会主义阵营的力量日益壮大，殖民体系日益解体，共产主义思想愈来愈深入人心，这是四十年来世界变化的趋向。
    现在社会主义阵营占有世界土地四分之一以上。全世界每三个人中就有一个人居住在社会主义国家里。社会主义国家的领土总面积占亚洲和欧洲全部领土的三分之二，比美国和所有欧洲资本主义国家的领土面积的总和还要多两倍。社会主义国家的人口约占全亚洲和欧洲人口的一半，比美国、英国、法国加在一起的人口还要多二点六倍。社会主义国家生产了世界工业产品的三分之一，生产了世界谷物总产量的40％。
    苏联和其他所有社会主义国家的国民经济发展速度都超过了最发达的资本主义国家。最近五年来，社会主义各国工业生产增长的速度比资本主义各国快一点六倍。去年，社会主义阵营生产了约七千万吨钢，比这些国家在第二次世界大战前的钢的年产量增加了一点八倍；生产了九亿七千万吨煤，比战前增加了一点五倍；生产了二千九百五十亿度电，比战前增加了三倍。
    在劳动生产率的提高，国民收入的提高，工人实际工资的提高方面，社会主义国家处处比资本主义优越。
    “宣传鼓动员手册”又指出，伟大的十月社会主义革命给殖民地人民指出了从帝国主义枷锁下解放的道路。在最近十二年当中，有十三亿以上的人民（占世界总人口的一半）从殖民地附庸地位解放出来。第二次大战后，在过去的殖民地土地上建立了二十多个新的独立国家。在1939年，在殖民地和附属国里居住着十五亿人口，占世界总人口的66％。现在，这个数字已经降到只有一亿六千万了。
    现在世界殖民主义的最大堡垒是美国。英国还拥有六百万平方公里八千多万人口的殖民地。法国还有一千多万平方公里四千二百万人口的殖民地，比利时和葡萄牙也还拥有许多殖民地。但是，历史的进程已经完全肯定了殖民制度的彻底崩溃。
      “宣传鼓动员手册”指出，十月社会主义革命以来的四十年是马克思列宁主义思想、共产主义思想胜利的四十年。在1917年十月革命前夜，全俄国的共产党员不超过二十五万人。在第二次世界大战开始时，包括苏联在内的四十三个国家里有共产党，党员共有四百二十万人。在第二次世界大战结束时，有共产党和工人党的国家增加到七十六国，党员总数超过两千万人。现在，世界各国的共产党员总数已经超过三千三百万人。十三个社会主义国家的共产党和工人党已经成为执政党。在资本主义国家里，现在有六十三个共产党，党员人数共约五百万人（不包括被关在监狱和集中营里的）；在三十多个国家内，共产党被迫处于不合法状态。在美国、阿根廷、墨西哥等国，共产党在半合法的状态下工作。
    各国共产党的威信不断增涨，譬如，到今年年初，意大利共产党已经有二百多万党员，法国共产党有约四十三万党员，印度尼西亚共产党在1945年成为合法政党时党员只有三千人，而现在已经增加到约一百六十万人。印度共产党的影响也在增涨，在今年的国会选举中获得了一千二百万选票，并且在喀拉拉邦组成了以共产党为首的政府。
    四十年来，世界的职工运动波澜日益壮阔。在1914年，世界的职工会总共有会员一千三百万人，现在已经增加到一亿六千万人，其中属于世界工联的有九千多万人。
    资本主义国家内工人阶级的斗争更加壮大坚强起来了。如果说，在第二次世界大战以前的十年内，在十一个资本主义国家里参加罢工的人数是两千一百万人，那么在战后十年内，这些国家的罢工人数已经增加到七千三百万人。
    世界和平运动以及妇女、青年运动的力量现在也非常强大。
      “宣传鼓动员手册”在叙述了这些事实后指出，伟大的十月社会主义革命以来的四十年证明，资本主义的死亡不可避免，未来属于社会主义，全世界各国劳动人民支持社会主义。社会主义将在世界范围内确立。
