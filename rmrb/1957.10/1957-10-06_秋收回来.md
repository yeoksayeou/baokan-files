Late autumn evening, a car carries a group of people who have finished their voluntary autumn harvest labor at the Huangtugang Agricultural Cooperative near Beijing, speeding towards the city.

Many of the people in the car are participating in agricultural production for the first time, and some, although they also came from the countryside, have long lost their labor habits after entering the city. After six days of field labor, their backs and legs are still a bit sore, but they are all tanned and radiant with joy.

Who was it who raised such a question in the crowd, "Although our hands have got a few blisters, we've really gained a lot!"

Mentioning gains, everyone opened up. Singing and laughter gradually subsided.

"I'll speak first," it was a female comrade, speaking in a high-pitched voice from a corner at the back of the car. "First of all, it increased the income of the cooperative; secondly, it strengthened our relationship with the farmers; and thirdly, it increased a lot of agricultural knowledge. If I hadn't come, I probably wouldn't even know what buckwheat or beans are. If I think about it in detail, I'm afraid there are more than ten or eight things..."

"How many exactly? You all say, and I'll count." Old Zhang put one leg on the bedding roll on the floor in front of his seat and stretched out his left hand, counting on his fingers.

"I think this counts as one too," someone continued. "In the office, I only eat one sesame cake and a bowl of porridge for breakfast. Now, I can eat a cornmeal pancake, and they're huge! They must weigh at least six taels."

"Eating one is nothing! Hey, didn't you see our Old Yuan? He eats two or two and a half at every meal!" Ma Yulan, the most active one, interjected.

Old Yuan is a shy person. He grew up in the city, went to school, and although he is twenty-seven or eight years old and quite tall, he has never been to the countryside. This time, he came prepared with a pair of cloth shoes that exposed his heels and an old blue uniform. As soon as he arrived at the villagers' home, he volunteered to carry water. Lacking shoulder strength, he swayed as he walked. The villagers wanted to dissuade him, but he insisted on carrying a second load after the first. When weeding, his back and legs hurt so much that he knelt down to work, sweat dripping from the tip of his nose. After weeding a row, he would stretch his back and sometimes say to others, "This is what it means to have sweat dripping onto the soil beneath the seedlings!" Now, he blushed a little when he heard everyone laughing.

Old Zhang was still asking, "Anything else? Anything else?"

"Of course, there is. This time we went to the agricultural cooperative, we have materials to refute the rightists. Like our large cooperative with more than two thousand households, almost every family has a bicycle, and every team and cadre's home has a radio amplifier, broadcasting news from the district and cooperative and listening to various programs on the Central People's Broadcasting Station. This cooperative's more than 17,000 mu of land encountered flooding on seven or eight thousand mu last year, just when the cooperative was established, reducing income by half, but everyone still had enough to eat and wear. As the cooperative director said, in the past, even smaller disasters would have forced many families to wander the streets and flee to other places. It's nonsense to say that farmers' lives have not improved! These situations should really be shown to those rightists!" Old Liu's words sounded like a speech at a meeting, serious and earnest, which amused everyone.

"In my opinion, this labor experience is truly going deep into life! In the past, we could only be said to be skimming the surface. I say that to go deep into life, you must eat and live with the villagers, especially work together. After this labor, I will feel a different taste when I eat spinach. How difficult it is to grow a vegetable!" It was easy to tell that it was Old Li speaking.

"If we could get our actors to come down to hoe the fields, carry things, bask in the sun, and sweat, and then ask them to express the thoughts and feelings of the working people, I think it would be truly authentic and profound."

Everyone talked so enthusiastically and lively, with laughter rising and falling, and they all felt that after this period of labor, the relationship between comrades was particularly close compared to in the office.

"Comrades, we've already got seven gains, is there anything else?" Old Zhang asked again.

"Of course, there is!" "Of course, there is!"

So, one person talked about having a "base" when they come down to live with the working people again, and another person said that they had learned ways to get close to the farmers. When someone suggested that the higher-level Party committee should institutionalize the voluntary labor system in the future, allowing everyone to regularly take some time to work and contact the farmers, everyone unanimously supported it.

The car stopped at the gate of the office building. Everyone carried their luggage, preparing to rest and go to work the next day, and they were still arguing about the gains of this labor as they walked up the stairs.

    秋收回来
    苗波
    深秋的傍晚，汽车载着一群参加北京近郊黄土岗农业社秋收义务劳动完毕的人向城里奔驰。
    车上的人，不少是头一回参加农业生产，还有一些人虽然也是从农村里出来，但是进城这些年，劳动习惯也早就丢了。经过六天田间的劳动锻炼，腰腿虽还有些酸痛，但，一个个晒得黑红，脸上都流露着无限的喜悦。
    是谁在人群里提出了这样一个问题，“咱们的手虽说打了几个泡，但要说起收获来，可真不少啊！”
    提到收获，大家便扯开了。歌唱声，谈笑声渐渐地被压低下去。
    “我先说”，是哪一位女同志尖声细嗓地从汽车最后边的一个角落里说话了。“首先是增加了合作社的收入；其次是密切了和农民的关系；再就是增长了很多农业知识，要是不来，恐怕什么叫荞麦、豆子都不知道。要详细地想一下，恐怕十条八条也不止……”
    “究竟有多少，你们说吧，我来数。”老张把一条腿蹬在座位前面脚下的铺盖卷上，伸出左手，扳着指头。
    “我看这也算一条，”又是谁接着发言了。“在机关里我吃早点，只吃一个烧饼一碗稀饭，现在吃那玉米面贴饼子一吃就是一个，那个儿真吓人，没有半斤也得有六两。”
    “你吃一个算什么，嘿，你没看咱们的老袁，每顿饭不是两个就是两个半！”最活跃的马玉兰截人短似的插了一句。
    老袁这人面皮薄。他是城市里一直住学校长大的，虽已二十七，八岁，长了个不小的个子，但是从没下过乡。这次他来，就预先换了一双露着脚后跟的布鞋，穿了一套旧蓝制服。刚一到老乡家里，就给挑水，肩膀没有功夫，就像扭秧歌似的迈着步子，老乡看了就想劝阻，但他挑了一担还要挑第二担。他锄草腰腿痛的不行了，就跪下干，汗珠顺着鼻尖一滴滴地淌下来，锄完一畦伸伸腰之后，有时就对别人说：“这才叫汗滴禾下土哩！”现在他听大家一笑，就有些脸红了。
  老张可还在问：“还有没有？还有没有？”
    “当然还有。我们这次到农业社一看，就有材料驳斥右派分子了。像咱们这二千多户的大社，差不多家家有一辆自行车，每个队和干部家里都有广播扩音器，播送区、社的新闻和听中央广播电台的各项节目。这个社的一万七千多亩地在去年刚一成立社时就遇到了七八千亩地的涝灾，收入减少了一半，但是每人仍然有吃有穿。就像社长说的，如果在过去就是比这灾情小，还不知有多少人家得流浪街头逃亡他乡了。说农民的生活没有提高真是鬼话！这些情况真该叫那些右派分子来看看！”老刘的这一段话，真像在大会上的发言，严肃认真，他那劲头，把大家逗乐了。
    “依我说，咱们这一次来劳动，才真叫深入生活哪！过去只能说是走马观花。我说要深入生活必须同老乡同吃、同住，特别是一同劳动。经过这次劳动，我再吃菠菜就会感到味道不同了。一棵菜长成该多不容易啊！”听声音就知道是老李说的。
    “如要叫咱们那些演员下来锄地，挑东西，晒太阳，流汗，再叫他（她）们去表现劳动人民的思想感情，我看一定会真实深刻。”
    大家谈的那么起劲、热闹，笑声时起时落，都觉得经过这一段劳动，同志间的关系比在机关里格外的亲切了。
    “同志们，收获已有七条了，还有没有？”老张又问。
    “当然有！”“当然有！”
    于是这个人又谈到再下来同劳动人民一起生活时有“据点”啦，那个人又说学到了接近农民的方式方法啦，当有人提出希望上级党委今后能把参加义务劳动制度化，让大家经常抽一定的时间进行劳动，和农民接触的时候，大家便异口同声一致拥护。
    汽车停在机关的门口了。每个人搬动着行李，准备休息一下第二天上班，走在楼梯上，还在争论这次劳动的收获哩。
