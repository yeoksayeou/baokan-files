    The Soviet Artificial Satellite Shatters the Myth of American Technology
    Shi Chao Li, Associate Professor of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics

    In August of this year, the Soviet Union launched the world's first ballistic intercontinental multi-stage rocket, equipping hydrogen and atomic bombs with the strongest "wings" that can fly to any place on Earth, including the most remote corners of the North American continent. If this event made the faces of the imperialists turn red with fear (because there was still a trace of doubt), then the Soviet Union's launch of the world's first artificial Earth satellite made the faces of the imperialists turn white with fear, because the artificial Earth satellite completely confirmed the reliability of the intercontinental rocket.

    The greatness of the Soviet Union's achievements in science and technology can be seen most clearly from two aspects. One is the reaction of capitalist countries to this event, and the other is the comparison with similar plans in capitalist countries.

    The United States has been touting and publicizing its artificial Earth satellite program—the "Vanguard" program—for several years. At the most recent International Astronautical Congress held in Rome, Italy, last year, the U.S. representatives explained the "Vanguard" program in detail, with pictures and models. Moreover, the artificial satellite itself—a small metal ball—and the three-stage rocket that launches the satellite were also exhibited, and the rocket launch situation and plan were also published in newspapers and periodicals. Some ambitious Americans have even been calculating on the moon several years ago, attempting to find a legal basis for occupying territory on planets outside the Earth. It seems that the United States is fully determined and confident to be at the forefront of the world in artificial satellites. Their consistent arrogance and vanity have made them mistakenly believe that this is not a problem. But the calculation did not work out. It was the Soviet Union, not the United States, that first launched the world's first "little moon." So when will the U.S. artificial satellite be launched? The person in charge of the U.S. "Vanguard" program has answered dejectedly: "Who knows, maybe two months, maybe another year."

    Is it just that the Soviet Union's artificial satellite was launched a few months or a year or two earlier than the United States? Not so. Although on such complex and difficult scientific and technological issues, being able to achieve success a certain time earlier is enough to show the huge superiority possessed by the successful party. From the artificial Earth satellite itself, the Soviet Union's scientific and technological advancement is particularly significant.

    According to the U.S. announced "Vanguard" program, its artificial satellite itself is a small sphere, about 50.8 centimeters in diameter, not much larger than a basketball. It weighs only 9.77 kilograms, with some scientific measuring instruments in the middle. The shell of the ball is made of extremely light magnesium alloy, plated with gold and chromium, and a layer of silicon oxide. To launch this small, less than ten-kilogram ball to the huge first cosmic velocity—the satellite orbital velocity that orbits the Earth without falling, about 8 kilometers per second (28,800 kilometers per hour), U.S. scientists plan to use a three-stage rocket. Its total weight is only nine tons. This is not large, even lighter than the German V-2 rocket that was successfully test-flown in 1942 (V-2 weighs about 13 tons). The first stage (the largest stage) of this three-stage rocket is a liquid-fueled rocket, about 13.7 meters long, without a tail, using a mixture of alcohol and gasoline as fuel, and liquid oxygen as the oxidizing agent for combustion, with a combustion time of about 140 seconds. It produces a maximum thrust of 12,250 kilograms (more than 12 tons). The total weight of the entire rocket at takeoff cannot be greater than this thrust, otherwise the rocket will not be able to climb. According to the plan, after the first-stage rocket is launched, it rises vertically and then tilts. When the fuel of the first-stage rocket is burned out, the speed of the entire rocket is 5,600 kilometers per hour, and the altitude exceeds 60 kilometers. Then the first-stage rocket automatically falls off, and the second-stage rocket starts to ignite. It is also a liquid rocket, and the maximum speed when the fuel is burned out may reach 17,700 kilometers per hour, and the altitude is about 208 kilometers. After the second stage falls off, the third stage continues to burn. This is a solid rocket, and the artificial satellite is hidden inside. When its fuel is burned out, it can propel the satellite to the required speed—8 kilometers per second. The orbital altitude is 480 kilometers, and the satellite orbits the Earth at this altitude, expected to orbit the Earth once every hour and a half.

    Even if the U.S. plan is realized, its artificial satellite itself weighs only more than nine kilograms, and the total weight of the rocket is only nine tons, which is far behind the Soviet artificial satellite.

    The Soviet artificial satellite is also a sphere, 58 centimeters in diameter, not much larger than the U.S. one, but its weight is 83.6 kilograms, which is more than eight times the weight of the U.S. one. Being more than eight times heavier means that the total weight of the entire Soviet rocket must be much larger. If, according to the U.S. plan, a nine-ton three-stage rocket is needed to accelerate a small ball weighing less than ten kilograms to a speed of 8 kilometers per second, then naturally a heavier rocket is needed to propel a sphere weighing more than eight times, more than 80 kilograms, to the same speed—at least dozens of tons heavier. According to a past report in foreign newspapers, the Soviet artificial satellite was also launched into the sky using a three-stage rocket, its total weight is about 150 tons, the first-stage rocket accelerates the entire rocket from the ground to 10,000 kilometers per hour, and the altitude reaches 80 kilometers, then falls off; the second stage continues to ignite, increasing the remaining rocket from the speed already obtained to 21,000 kilometers per hour, and the altitude also increases to 322 kilometers, then falls off; finally, the third-stage rocket accelerates the satellite to 8 kilometers per second, and carries it to an orbital altitude of more than 300 kilometers to more than 1,300 kilometers. Currently, the actual operating altitude of the Soviet artificial satellite is 900 kilometers at the highest point and 300 to 500 kilometers at the lowest point (elliptical orbit), which is within this range. As for the actual speed of orbiting the Earth—one revolution around the Earth in one hour and thirty-five minutes, sixteen revolutions in twenty-four hours—it also matches the estimated figures. (The estimated weight of the rocket remains to be confirmed.)

    What is worth noting here is the weight of the rocket. If it is 150 tons, then the thrust of its first-stage rocket must be much greater than this figure, otherwise it will not be able to take off from the ground. Even if it is dozens of tons (for example, 75 tons), then the thrust of the first-stage rocket must be hundreds of tons, which shows that the Soviet Union's current jet propulsion technology has reached such a high level—being able to manufacture giant rockets with a thrust of at least hundreds of tons. This is clearly much larger than the first-stage rocket of the U.S. "Vanguard" program with a thrust of nearly 13 tons. The large thrust of the rocket can only illustrate one fact, that is, the Soviet Union's technology is superb. Because the rocket's thrust is large, the design and construction must be very good, the materials used are light, strong and resistant to high temperatures, and the fuel is superior, requiring a large calorific value, which eloquently proves that the Soviet Union's jet machinery design level is high, and the metallurgical, materials and chemical industries are advanced. Not only that, since the Soviet Union has already launched an artificial Earth satellite weighing more than 80 kilograms into a predetermined elliptical orbit around the Earth, this also shows the Soviet Union's great achievements in mathematics, mechanics, astronomy and other theories. Without these sciences, it would be impossible to make accurate trajectory calculations. At the same time, the artificial satellite also has radio communication equipment and other scientific instruments, which shows that the Soviet Union has made great progress in the electronics radio industry and instrument equipment industry.

    The Soviet Union is also studying the manufacture of larger, heavier and more complex Earth satellites and lunar satellites. Following the current satellite, the Soviet Union will next launch a satellite carrying live animals. This is moving forward in the direction of human space flight. It has been estimated that to carry a useful payload of about 24 tons (including personnel, equipment, scientific instruments, daily necessities, etc.) to a satellite orbit 1,700 kilometers above the ground, and establish a manned space station, a three-stage rocket with a total weight of about 7,000 tons (almost equal to the weight of a cruiser) is needed. Compared with the achievements already obtained, this number seems very large, but this is only a difference in quantity. Therefore, human space flight is entirely possible to be realized in a not too long period of time.

    The above facts show that the Soviet Union's artificial Earth satellite surpasses the most advanced capitalist country, the United States, not only in achieving success earlier in time, but more importantly in the advancement of the artificial Earth satellite and rocket technology itself. The United States is still like this, not to mention Britain and France. No wonder on both sides of the Atlantic, from Washington to London, from Paris to Bonn, the cries and wails of panic and despair are emitted from that small group of ruling groups.

    Is the imperialist ruling group's cries and wails specifically for the backwardness of their science and technology in the peaceful competition? Of course not, although this matter itself has dealt a fatal blow to their consistent arrogance and self-importance. From this matter, they also clearly know that they are also behind in the competition of military science and technology. The Soviet Union has the so-called "last weapon" that the imperialist ruling group dreams of—a multi-stage rocket ballistic intercontinental missile with a hydrogen bomb, that is, a ballistic intercontinental multi-stage rocket, because the multi-stage rocket that can carry an artificial Earth satellite to a speed of 8 kilometers per second and orbit the Earth is the same type of multi-stage (possibly two-stage or three-stage) rocket that can carry a hydrogen weapon equivalent to millions of tons of high explosives to a speed of 6 to 7 kilometers per second (21,600 to 25,200 kilometers per hour) and fly over a distance of 8,000 kilometers or more. Therefore, this has shattered the dream of the U.S. imperialist warmongers to carry out destructive wars outside their homeland.

    From this point of view, the successful launch of the Soviet artificial Earth satellite not only opened up a new era in human science and technology—laying a solid foundation for future space flight, but also extremely powerfully defended world peace.

    苏联人造卫星粉碎了美国技术的神话
    北京航空学院副教授　史超礼
    今年8月苏联发射了世界第一颗弹道式洲际多级火箭，给氢弹和原子弹装上了最坚强的“翅膀”，可以飞向地球上任何地方，包括北美大陆最辽远的角落。如果这件事使帝国主义者的面孔吓得发红（因为其中还有一丝怀疑）的话，苏联发射的世界第一颗人造地球卫星，就使帝国主义者的面孔吓得发白了，因为人造地球卫星完全证实了洲际火箭的可靠。
    苏联人造卫星在科学技术上的成就的伟大，由两方面可以看得最清楚。一方面是资本主义国家对此事的反应，另一方面是和资本主义国家同类计划的比较。
    美国在好几年前就为它的人造地球卫星计划——“先锋”计划大吹大擂广事宣传了。去年在意大利罗马城举行的最近一届国际宇宙航行学年会上，美国的代表详细说明了“先锋”计划，有图片、有模型。而且人造卫星本身——一个不大的金属球和发射卫星的三级火箭都还曾作过展览，火箭发射的情况和计划也在报刊上发表过。美国的一些野心大到包天的人，甚至早在几年前就在打月亮的算盘，企图为在地球以外的星球上占地盘找法律根据。看来，美国满有决心和信心在人造卫星上走在世界的最前面，他们一向的狂妄和虚骄使他们错误地认为这是不成问题的事。可是算盘并没打准。是苏联，不是美国，首先发射了世界上第一颗“小月亮”。那么美国的人造卫星到底何时发射呢？美国负责“先锋”计划的人已经沮丧地作了回答：“谁知道，也许两个月，也许还要一年。”
    是否苏联的人造卫星仅比美国的早几个月或一两年发射就完事了呢？并不如此，虽然在这样复杂艰巨的科学技术问题上，能早若干时间获得成功这件事本身，就足以表明获得成功的一方所拥有的巨大的优越性。从人造地球卫星本身来看，苏联在科学技术上的先进性是表现得尤其显著的。
    根据美国所宣布的“先锋”计划，它的人造卫星本身是个小圆球，直径约五十点八公分，比一只篮球大不太多。重量只有九点七七公斤，中间带了些科学测量仪器。球的壳体是极轻的镁合金，上面镀了金和铬，还有一层氧化矽。要把这个小小的、不上十公斤重的球发射到巨大的第一宇宙速度——环绕地球飞行不掉下来的卫星轨道速度，约每秒八公里（每小时二万八千八百公里），美国科学家计划用三级火箭。它的总重量只有九吨。这并不大，甚至比德国人在1942年试飞成功的V—2火箭还要轻（V—2重约十三吨）。这个三级火箭的第一级（最大的一级）是液体燃料火箭，长约十三点七公尺，没有尾巴，用的燃料是酒精和汽油的混合物，助燃的氧化剂是液体氧，燃烧时间约为一百四十秒。它产生的最大推力是一万二千二百五十公斤（十二吨多）。整个火箭起飞时的总重量是不可能比这个推力大的，否则火箭就爬升不起来了。按照计划，第一级火箭射出后，垂直上升，然后倾斜。到第一级火箭的燃料烧光时，整个火箭的速度为每小时五千六百公里，高度超过六十公里。然后第一级火箭自动脱落，第二级火箭开始点火工作。它也是一只液体火箭，燃料烧光时的最大速度可能达到每小时一万七千七百公里，高度约二百零八公里。第二级脱落后，第三级继续燃烧工作。这是一只固体火箭，人造卫星即藏在里面。它在燃料烧光时，就可以把卫星推进到需要的速度——每秒八公里。轨道高度是四百八十公里，卫星在这个高度上环绕地球飞行，预计每一个半小时环绕地球一圈。
    美国的这个计划就是实现了，它的人造卫星本身只有九公斤多重，火箭的总重也只有九吨，和苏联的人造卫星比，也还差得很远。
    苏联的人造卫星也是圆球，直径五十八公分，比美国的大不太多，可是重量却为八十三点六公斤，比美国的重量超过八倍。重八倍多，这就意味着苏联的整个火箭的总重量要大得多。如果按美国的计划，把不上十公斤重的小球，加速到每秒八公里的速度，需要一个九吨的三级火箭的话，那么要把重量超过八倍的、八十多公斤重的球体，推进到同样速度，所需的火箭自然就更重了——至少重好几十吨。据过去外国报刊的一个报道，苏联的人造卫星也是用三级火箭带上天，它的总重量约一百五十吨，第一级火箭把整个火箭从地面加速到每小时一万公里，高度到达八十公里，然后脱落；第二级继续点火工作，把其余的火箭从已获得的速度，再增加到每小时二万一千公里，高度也增加到三百二十二公里，然后脱落；最后第三级火箭把卫星加速到每秒八公里，带到三百多公里到一千三百多公里的轨道高度。目前苏联人造卫星的实际运行高度最高点是九百公里，最低点是三百到五百公里（椭圆轨道），正在这个范围内。至于实际环绕地球的速度——一小时三十五分绕地球一圈，二十四小时绕十六圈，也和估计的数字相符。（火箭的估计重量，还待证实。）
    这里值得我们注意的是火箭的重量。如果它是一百五十吨，那么它的第一级火箭的推力一定得比这个数字大不少，否则无法离地起飞。就算是几十吨（比如说七十五吨），那么第一级火箭的推力也得上百吨，这就说明苏联目前喷气推进技术已经达到这样高的水平——能够制造推力至少百吨的巨型火箭。这显然比美国近十三吨推力的“先锋”计划第一级火箭大了不少倍。火箭的推力大只能说明一个事实，那就是苏联的技术高超。因为火箭的推力大，必须设计和构造都很好，使用的材料轻、强并且能耐高温，燃料优越，需要发热量大，这就雄辩地证明了苏联喷气机械的设计水平高，冶金、材料和化学工业先进。不仅如此，苏联既然已经把八十多公斤重的人造地球卫星发射到预定的环绕地球的椭圆轨道，这还说明苏联在数学、力学、天文学等理论方面的巨大成就，没有这些科学是不可能作精确的航迹轨道计算的。同时，人造卫星上还有无线电通讯设备和其他科学仪器，这又表明苏联在电子无线电工业和仪表设备工业上获得了很大的发展。
    苏联还正在研究制造更大更重更复杂的地球卫星和月球卫星。继目前这颗卫星之后，苏联下一步将发射出携带活的动物的卫星。这正是朝人类宇宙飞行的方向前进。有人作过估计，要把大约二十四吨重的有用载荷（包括人员、器材、科学仪器、生活用品等），带到离地面一千七百公里的卫星轨道，建立一个有人的空间站，需要总重约为七千吨（几乎等于一艘巡洋舰的重量）的三级火箭。这个数字和目前已获得的成就相较，似乎很大，但这只是量的差别。因此，人类宇宙飞行是完全有可能在不太长的时间内实现的。
    上述事实表明，苏联的人造地球卫星超越过资本主义最先进的国家美国的地方，不仅在于时间上先获得成功，尤其重要的还在于人造地球卫星和火箭技术本身的先进。美国尚且如此，英法就更不必论。这就毋怪在大西洋的两岸，从华盛顿到伦敦，从巴黎到波恩，从那一小撮统治集团中发出惊慌、沮丧的闹声和哀鸣了。
    帝国主义统治集团的一片闹声和哀鸣，难道是专门为自己的科学技术在和平竞赛中的落后而发的么？当然不是，虽然这事本身就使他们一向的狂妄自大遭到了致命的打击。由这事他们还清楚地知道，他们在军事科学技术的竞赛中也落后了。苏联拥有了帝国主义统治集团梦寐以求的所谓“最后的武器”——带氢弹的多级火箭弹道式洲际导弹，也就是弹道式洲际多级火箭，因为能把人造地球卫星带到每秒八公里速度、环绕地球飞行的多级火箭，正是那种能把相当于百万吨烈性炸药的氢武器带到每秒六到七公里（每小时二万一千六百到二万五千二百公里）的速度、飞越八千公里或更远路程的同类型的多级（可能为二级或三级）火箭。因此，这就打破了美帝国主义好战分子企图在他的本土之外进行毁灭性战争的梦想。
    从这一点上来看，苏联人造地球卫星发射的成功，不仅在人类科学技术上开辟了一个新纪元——为未来的宇宙航行建立了坚固的基础，而且还极其有力地保卫了世界和平。
