On the Anti-Rightist Front

Rightist Poet Gong Liu Exposed

In the anti-Rightist struggle, the People's Liberation Army General Political Department's creative writing division exposed the rightist true colors of the poet Gong Liu. During the period of extensive airing of views and debates, Gong Liu launched a series of attacks against the Party. He compared the Party to the reactionary ruling classes of past dynasties, arguing that "the Communist Party's vigilance against enemies has reached the point of being neurotic," and that "political movements ruin people." He also hurled abuse at the activists of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, calling them "Gestapo" and "persecution maniacs." When an anti-communist tide appeared internationally in December of last year, Gong Liu echoed these sentiments and submitted a "statement of appeal" to the organization, attempting to overturn the Party's conclusion on its review of his historical issues.

Gong Liu wrote many anti-Party things. In his poem "Nostalgia," published in the 22nd issue of "New Observer" last year, he wrote vicious lines such as: "The incompetent are in power, stifling the aspirations of men, there is no way to serve the country, where can one mount a horse and kill the enemy?" and "Dust rolls, it is difficult to see the features of the Central Plains." The "Hedgehog's Philosophy" and "Crow and Pig," published in Wenhui Daily, were poems with obvious allegorical meanings that alluded to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and attacked the Party. Gong Liu had close ties with Wu Zuguang's "small family" and spread rumors and slanders together.

    右派诗人公刘现形
    解放军总政治部创作室在反右派斗争中揭露了诗人公刘的右派原形。公刘在大放大鸣期间对党作了一连串的攻击，他把党比作历代的反动统治阶级，认为：“共产党对敌人的警惕已到了神经过敏的程度”，“政治运动是毁人”，谩骂肃反运动的积极分子是“盖世太保”“迫害狂”。去年12月国际上出现一股反共逆流时，公刘也随着叫嚣并向组织上提出“申辩书”，企图推翻党对他的历史问题审查的结论。
    公刘写了很多反党的东西。他在去年第二十二期“新观察”上“怀古”一首诗中写出：“昏庸当道，戕尽了男儿志气，报国无门，何处能跃马杀敌？”“胡尘滚滚，难见中原风貌”等恶毒的字句。在文汇报上发表的“刺猬的哲学”、“乌鸦与猪”等都是寓意明显的影射肃反和攻击党的诗。公刘与吴祖光的“小家族”过从甚密，一起散布流言蜚语。
