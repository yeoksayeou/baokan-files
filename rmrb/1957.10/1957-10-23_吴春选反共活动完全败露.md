On the Anti-Rightist Front

	Wu Chunxuan's Anti-Communist Activities Completely Exposed

	Wu Chunxuan was an alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and a full-time secretary of the Culture and Education Committee. He served the Zhang-Luo alliance and engaged in many anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies. Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji illegally organized so-called "Scientific Planning" and "University党委Responsible System" and other four temporary working groups to attack the Communist Party. Wu Chunxuan actively participated in planning the selection of personnel for these four illegal organizations, convening meetings, and disseminating information to the outside world. The whole set of anti-socialist scientific programs issued in the name of the "Temporary Working Group for Scientific Planning of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League" was drafted by Wu Chunxuan, following the instructions of the rightists Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, and Fei Xiaotong. When the notorious anti-socialist scientific program was published in the Guangming Daily, he also personally wrote a short commentary entitled "Opening a New Path for Mutual Supervision," attempting to expand its influence and attack the Party.

	During the blooming and contending period, Wu Chunxuan became carried away and went directly to the grassroots to incite trouble. He went to the China People's University, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Agricultural University in a planned way to spread lies within the China Democratic League organizations, and disseminated anti-Party information from rightists in other schools to instigate action. Recently, cadres of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League held a meeting to expose Wu Chunxuan's series of reactionary activities.

    吴春选反共活动完全败露
    吴春选是民盟候补中央委员、文教委员会的专职秘书。他为章、罗联盟服务，干了许多反共、反社会主义的阴谋活动。章伯钧、罗隆基非法组织所谓“科学规划”、“高等学校党委负责制”等四个临时工作组，向共产党进攻，这四个非法组织的人选、召集会议、对外发布消息等，吴春选都积极参预策划。以“民盟中央科学规划临时工作组”的名义发出的一整套反社会主义的科学纲领，即由吴春选秉承右派分子曾昭抡、钱伟长、费孝通的意旨草拟的。当臭名昭著的反社会主义的科学纲领在光明日报发表时，他还亲自写了“为互相监督开辟了新路”的短评，企图扩大影响，向党进攻。
    鸣放期间，吴春选得意忘形，更直接到基层点火，他先后到中国人民大学、北京师范大学、北京农业大学的民盟组织中有计划地散布谎言，并传播其他学校的右派分子的反党情况，进行煽动。最近，民盟中央机关干部曾集会揭露吴春选的一系列的反动活动。
