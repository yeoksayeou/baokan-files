The Soviet Union's economic and cultural construction has developed rapidly during the forty years since the October Socialist Revolution. The Soviet people have victoriously completed five Five-Year Plans and are now smoothly implementing the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The execution of these plans has made the Soviet Union a powerful socialist industrial country and is advancing towards communism.

In the past forty years, the development of Soviet industry has been astonishing. The total industrial output in 1957 increased by 45 times compared to 1917, exceeding the 1913 level by 32 times. During the period from 1913 to 1957, the United States' industrial production only increased by three times, while Britain and France increased by less than one time. Before the revolution, Russia's industrial production only accounted for 2% to 3% of the world's total industrial output, while currently the Soviet Union's industrial output accounts for about 20% of the world's total industrial output. In just forty years, the Soviet Union has transformed from an industrially backward country into the first industrial power in Europe and the second in the world.

Under the principle of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, especially the machine manufacturing industry, the production of means of production in the Soviet Union has developed even more rapidly. In 1957, the production of means of production increased by 73 times compared to 1913, and their proportion in the total industrial output has risen from 33% in 1913 to more than 70% in 1956. This year, the total output of the machine manufacturing industry and the metal processing industry increased to 200 times that of 1913.

In 1956, the Soviet Union produced 48.6 million tons of steel, equivalent to 12 times that of 1913; mined 429 million tons of coal, equivalent to 15 times that of 1913; oil production reached 83.8 million tons, equivalent to 9 times that of 1913; and power generation reached 192 billion kilowatt-hours, almost equal to 100 times that of 1913.

On the basis of the development of heavy industry, the Soviet Union's light industry has also achieved great development. In 1957, the total output of consumer goods increased by 12 times compared to 1913. The variety of consumer goods is also increasing, and the quality is constantly improving.

The Soviet Union's industrial technology is progressing very rapidly. Now the Soviet Union is able to manufacture various new and most complex machines and equipment. In 1956 alone, 650 new types of machines and equipment were manufactured. The degree of mechanization and automation of Soviet industry is also among the best in the world. The Soviet Union is now the country with the most combined machines and new equipment production in industry, the longest power transmission lines, the highest degree of mechanization in the coal mining industry, and the largest-scale hydropower station construction projects. In addition, in the past forty years, the average annual growth rate of labor productivity in Soviet industry has also exceeded any capitalist country, one and a half to several times faster than countries such as the United States, Britain, and France.

While industry is developing, the Soviet Union has also achieved brilliant achievements in agricultural production, and many important agricultural products have jumped to the first place in the world.

The Soviet Union has long completed the collectivization of agriculture, transforming 25 million small farmers into large-scale collective farms equipped with advanced technology. The Soviet Union has the world's largest and most mechanized agriculture. By the beginning of 1957, Soviet agriculture had 1,577,000 tractors, 385,000 grain combines, 631,000 trucks, and millions of other agricultural machines. The sown area of various crops has expanded by more than 50% compared to 1913, the wheat sown area has almost doubled, technical crops 1.7 times, and cotton and sugar beets doubled. Due to the realization of mechanization and electrification in agricultural production, the technical level of cultivation and the yield per unit area have also greatly improved.

The Soviet Union's grain production has been increasing continuously, and the food problem has long been fundamentally solved. The bumper harvest in 1956 further greatly increased grain production. At present, the Soviet Union's total wheat production has exceeded the United States and Canada, ranking first in the world. 1956 was a year of unprecedented cotton production in the Soviet Union, with total production increasing by almost 5 million tons compared to 1955. Compared with before the October Revolution, the Soviet Union's total cotton production has increased fivefold, and the sown area has increased twofold. The Soviet Union's cotton yield per unit area and quality are both ranked first in the world. Another important economic crop in the Soviet Union—sugar beet—has long ranked first in the world. The yield per unit area of sugar beets in the Kyrgyz Republic alone has caught up with the United States, greatly exceeding the levels of France, Italy, Britain, and Denmark. The Soviet Union's sown area and production of potatoes are ranked first in the world.

The fruitful results of grain production have promoted the development of animal husbandry. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has proposed that in the next few years, the production of meat, milk, and fats should catch up with the United States in terms of per capita calculation. Agricultural workers across the country have actively formulated socialist competition plans. At present, the milk production per capita in the three Baltic republics of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania has greatly exceeded the United States. In 1957, the Soviet Union's animal fats are expected to catch up with the United States.

During the Soviet era, the Soviet Union also achieved great achievements on the cultural revolution front. In terms of specialized talents with higher and secondary specialized education, there were less than 200,000 before the revolution, but currently there are more than 6.2 million in various economic and cultural sectors throughout the Soviet Union, an increase of 30 times.

Before the revolution, the proportion of illiteracy among the residents was very high. Now, not only has illiteracy long been eradicated, but also a seven-year universal education system has long been implemented throughout the country. Currently, about 50 million people in the Soviet Union are receiving education in various forms.

In terms of the training of scientific and technical specialized talents, the Soviet Union has long surpassed any capitalist country. The Soviet Union now has more engineers in various industries than the United States. The Soviet Union has achieved great achievements in science and technology, such as building the world's first atomic power plant, jet passenger plane, intercontinental ballistic missile, and artificial earth satellite, and building the world's largest synchronous phase-stable accelerator. Now the scientific level of the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States.

During the Soviet era, the Soviet Union published 1,327,300 kinds of books in 122 languages, with a total circulation of 19.3 billion copies. The number of books issued last year increased by 11.8 times compared to 1913. The Soviet Union now publishes 7,537 kinds of newspapers in 60 languages, and these newspapers have a total circulation of more than 53.5 million copies, almost 19 times more than in 1913.

The vigorous development of the Soviet national economy has promoted the continuous improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people.

During the Soviet era, unemployment has been permanently eradicated. At present, the number of employees in the Soviet national economy has reached more than 52.5 million, more than three times more than in 1913.

Calculated on a per capita basis, the Soviet Union's national income in 1956 has increased by 12 times compared to 1913, which is much faster than any capitalist country. The Soviet Union's national income is entirely distributed in accordance with the interests of the working people, of which three-quarters are used for personal consumption, while in capitalist countries, more than half of the national income is seized by a small number of exploiting classes. This year, the expenditures and benefits used on the people in the Soviet state budget are expected to increase to at least 192 billion rubles, and almost 1,000 rubles can be distributed to each person.

In terms of health care, there was only one doctor for every 10,000 residents in Russia before the revolution, while now there are 17 doctors for every 10,000 residents in the Soviet Union, exceeding the United States. Due to the improvement of the living standards of the broad masses and the implementation of a perfect medical care system, the health of the Soviet people has been greatly enhanced, and the mortality rate is lower than most countries in the world (including the United States and France). The average life expectancy of Soviet residents has doubled compared to before the revolution.

The great achievements of the Soviet Union's economic and cultural development in the past forty years vividly demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

    苏联建设的巨大成就
    十月社会主义革命以来的四十年间，苏联的经济和文化建设已经获得了迅速的发展。苏联人民已经胜利地完成了五个五年计划，现在正在顺利地执行第六个五年计划。这些计划的执行，已经使苏联成为一个强大的社会主义工业国，并正在向着共产主义迈进。
    四十年来，苏联工业的发展是十分惊人的。1957年工业总产量比1917年增加了四十五倍，超过1913年水平的三十二倍。而在1913至1957年期间，美国的工业生产只增加了三倍，英国和法国增长不到一倍。革命前，俄国的工业生产仅占世界工业总产量的2％至3％，而目前苏联的工业产量已占世界工业总产量的20％左右了。在短短的四十年间，苏联已从一个工业落后的国家一跃而成为欧洲第一和世界第二的工业强国了。
    在优先发展重工业特别是机器制造业的方针下，苏联的生产资料生产发展更为迅速。1957年生产资料生产比1913年增加了七十三倍，它们在工业总产量中的比重已从1913年的占33％上升到1956年的占70％强。今年，机器制造工业和金属加工工业总产量增加为1913年的二百倍。
    在1956年，苏联生产了四千八百六十万吨钢，等于1913年的十二倍；采煤四亿二千九百万吨，等于1913年的十五倍；石油产量达到八千三百八十万吨，等于1913年的九倍；发电量达到一千九百二十亿度，几乎等于1913年的一百倍。
    在重工业发展的基础上，苏联的轻工业也获得了很大的发展。1957年消费品生产总量比1913年增加了十二倍。消费品的品种也日益增加，质量亦不断提高。
    苏联的工业技术进步是十分迅速的。现在苏联已能制造各种新式的最复杂的机器和设备，仅在1956年内就制成了六百五十种新型机器设备。苏联工业的机械化和自动化程度在世界上也是头等的。苏联现在是世界上联合机和工业中新装备生产最多、输电线最长、煤矿工业机械化程度最高、水电站建设工程规模最大的国家。此外，在过去四十年中，苏联工业中的劳动生产率每年平均增长速度也超过任何资本主义国家，比美、英、法等国要快一倍半到几倍。
    在工业发展的同时，苏联在农业生产上也获得了辉煌的成就，许多重要的农产品已跃居世界第一位。
    苏联早已完成了农业的集体化，把二千五百万小农户变为用先进技术装备起来的大规模的集体农庄。苏联拥有世界上规模最大、机械化程度最高的农业。到1957年初，苏联农业已拥有一百五十七万七千台拖拉机、三十八万五千台谷物联合收割机、六十三万一千辆载重汽车和数百万架其他农业机器。各种农作物的播种面积比1913年扩大了50％多，小麦播种面积几乎扩大一倍，技术作物一点七倍，棉花和甜菜二倍。由于农业生产上实现了机械化和电气化，耕作的技术水平和单位面积产量亦有极大的提高。
    苏联的谷物产量不断增加，粮食问题早已根本解决。1956年的大丰收，更使粮食产量大大增加。目前，苏联的小麦总产量已超过美国和加拿大，占世界第一位。1956年是苏联棉花产量空前丰收的一年，总产量比1955年几乎增加了五百万吨。与十月革命以前相比，苏联的棉花总产量增加了五倍、播种面积增加了两倍。苏联的棉花的单位面积产量和质量都居世界第一位。苏联另一重要的经济作物——甜菜，早就占世界第一位。单就吉尔吉斯共和国甜菜的单位面积产量已赶上了美国，大大超过了法、意、英和丹麦的水平。苏联马铃薯的播种面积和生产量占世界第一位。
    谷物生产的丰硕成果促进了畜牧业的发展。苏联共产党已经提出，要在最近几年内，在肉类、牛奶和油脂的生产上按人口平均计算赶上美国。全国农业劳动者都积极地订出了社会主义竞赛计划。目前，波罗的海沿岸的拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚和立陶宛三个共和国的牛奶产量，按人口平均计算，已大大超过美国。1957年，苏联的动物油脂预计可以赶上美国。
    在苏维埃政权年代里，苏联在文化革命战线上也获得了巨大的成就。以受过高等和中等专门教育的专门人才来说，革命以前还不到二十万人，而目前在苏联全国各个经济和文化部门中已经拥有六百二十多万人，即增加为三十倍。
    在革命前，文盲在居民中的比重很大。现在不仅文盲早已绝迹，而且全国各地早已实行了七年制的普及教育。现在苏联约有五千万人受着各种形式的教育。
    在科学技术专门人才的培养方面，苏联早就超过任何资本主义国家。现在苏联拥有的各行各业的工程师已超过美国。苏联在科学技术上已经取得了伟大的成就，例如建成了世界上第一个原子能发电站、喷气式客机、洲际弹道火箭和人造地球卫星，并建成了世界最大的同步稳相加速器。现在苏联的科学水平已经超过美国。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，苏联共用一百二十二种文字出版了一百三十二万七千三百种书籍，总发行额为一百九十三亿册。去年图书的发行册数比1913年增加了十一点八倍。苏联现在用六十种文字出版七千五百三十七种报纸，这些报纸共发行五千三百五十万份以上，几乎比1913年增加了十九倍。
    苏联国民经济的蓬勃发展，促成了苏联人民物质福利和文化水平的不断提高。
    在苏维埃政权年代里，失业现象已永远地绝迹了。目前，苏联国民经济中的职工人数已经达到五千二百五十万人以上，即比1913年多三倍多。
    如按人口平均计算，1956年苏联的国民收入已比1913年增长了十二倍，这比任何资本主义国家的增长速度都快得多。苏联的国民收入完全是按照劳动人民的利益来进行分配的，其中用于个人消费的占四分之三，而在资本主义国家里，国民收入的一半以上是被少数剥削阶级攫为己有的。今年，苏联国家预算中用在人民身上的开支和优待费预计至少要增加到一千九百二十亿卢布，差不多每人可分配到一千卢布。
    在卫生保健事业方面，革命前俄国每一万居民中只有一个医生，而现在苏联每一万居民中已有十七个医生而超过了美国。由于广大群众生活水平的提高和实行了完善的医疗保健制度，苏联人民的健康大大增强而死亡率已经比世界大多数国家（包括美国和法国在内）都低。苏联居民的平均寿命已经比革命前整整延长一倍。
    苏联四十年来经济和文化发展的伟大成就，生动地说明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。　　　　　（刘白生）
