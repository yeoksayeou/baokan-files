    A Friend from Shatagil
    Cao Ming

    Although this is the Liaonan region, the weather is already in the dead of winter, so cold that people can't stretch out their hands. Moreover, he had just arrived here from cold Shatagil, passing through the icy and snowy Siberia and Manchuria. As soon as this Soviet transportation expert got off the train, the director of Ansteel's Transportation Department, engineers, and technicians happily surrounded him. Before they could say ten words, the expert suddenly asked the translator to tell the welcomers that he wanted to set off to inspect the lines. Everyone was stunned, because they all knew that this white-haired man was not in good health to begin with, and had been on the train for eight or nine days straight, catching a cold on the train. So, everyone was both moved and eager to persuade him. However, he said that from the day he received the order, he had been thinking that the Soviet people had sent him to help China with its construction. In order to help build a second powerful socialist country, what did the severe cold matter? Besides, the enthusiasm of the welcomers had already melted away the cold. What did eight or nine days of travel matter? In his heart, the thousands of kilometers of journey had been shortened to a distance of only a few seconds. "How can I come here to rest?" It took a lot of effort to persuade him to stay, and they accompanied him to his residence.

    Thus, Comrade Mironovich left a deep impression on everyone for the first time. As time went on, people gradually realized that he was not just naturally impatient. He used this tenacious spirit in all his work. During the New Year, leading cadres all went to work on-site, and the expert volunteered to work with his Chinese comrades. While people in the streets and alleys were celebrating the New Year, the expert was working on-site as usual. He said with a smile, "I feel like I'm in our Shatagil here. Even this small round table is the same as the one there." In three months, the expert left diligent footprints on the more than 360-kilometer-long railway line of Ansteel. He not only knew when various ores and coal from Hainan Island, Jiangxi, Fengfeng, Fushun, and other places were transported to which station; he also understood that some stations or sections were delayed, the ore could not be transported in, and the blast furnace was waiting for materials; the molten iron supply was not timely, and the steelworkers were braving the fire; the steel ingots often cooled down when they were transported to the steel rolling mill; and the orders from factories and mines in various places could not be shipped out, and the urging telegrams flew like snowflakes, making the supply personnel anxious... After careful analysis and research, the expert believed that most of these reasons were man-made, and some were because the past equipment and regulations could not keep up with the requirements of Ansteel's reconstruction and expansion. He put forward many practical and feasible suggestions in different categories. Ansteel's transportation work gradually improved.

    Lingshan Station is the most important import and export station of Ansteel, but it is also the station with the most accumulated wagons, especially in summer, when the amount of ore imported increases and the accumulation of wagons is serious. At one point, 398 wagons were accumulated in one day and night, almost blocking all the stacking lines. In order to solve this key problem, the expert and the stationmaster walked to Lingshan Station, checking the arrival time of the wagons, how long they had been accumulated, and the reasons for the accumulation. It was raining that day, and people's clothes were wet. The stationmaster, out of concern for the expert, advised him to come back another day. The expert smiled and shook his head and replied, "The blast furnace can't starve and wait for a sunny day." The expert found a worker, pointed to the wagons, and asked him why he didn't unload those wagons. The worker replied, "The doors are all rusted, and it's not easy to unload, so we pushed them aside; we unload the easy ones first." The expert patiently followed up and asked, "Do you know how much the country will lose if you unload one hour late?" The worker shook his head blankly. The expert nodded and said to his Chinese comrades, "No wonder the workers, it's just that we didn't explain it clearly to them." It turned out that in order to facilitate the turnover of wagons, the Railway Bureau had stipulated a stay indicator, and if it exceeded the indicator, not only would there be a fine; but the losses caused by the delay in production due to the accumulation of ore and steel would be even greater.

    After working hard all day, the expert hurriedly drafted suggestions at night to improve the work. The system of leading cadres taking responsibility for checking in-depth according to regional divisions, the three-shift "economic accounting" board, and the "waybill box" in the ore yard were all established during this period. The expert was not satisfied with the establishment of these systems and the achievements they had made. He thought that although the wagons had wheels, it was people who made the wheels turn; it was better to say that he was enthusiastic about implementing the system than to say that he was more interested in doing the work of "people." So, he used his spare time to come to work an hour early every day and take turns going to various stations and sections to give lectures to the workers, talking about the benefits that shortening the loading and unloading time would bring to building socialism, talking about the importance of railways to socialist economic and cultural life, and also talking about the great role played by transport workers during the Soviet Patriotic War. The workers were very happy to listen, and felt that their arms and shoulders could not only carry hundreds of pounds of things, but also shoulder the responsibility of building socialism. In a month or two, most of the more than 9,000 employees scattered across more than 300 kilometers of the line had heard the expert's lectures. The loading and unloading indicators at Lingshan Station decreased significantly. Those who had failed to complete their tasks for several months had already overfulfilled them in July and August. In September, the workers automatically requested to shorten the quota by another hour. The experience of Lingshan Station was very exciting, and many stations and sections sent people to learn from it. Cadres doing branch work, league work, and trade union work were also willing to talk to the expert, wanting to know the experience of Shatagil. On the eve of National Day, just as people were preparing to express their gratitude to the expert, they first received a congratulatory letter from the expert. "After I go back, I will definitely tell the Soviet people about your achievements, and they will be proud of the achievements of the Chinese workers." - The words in the letter touched the hearts of the workers.

    One day, a transport worker was injured, and the expert immediately rushed to the scene by car. Because the ambulance had not yet arrived, the expert insisted on sending the injured person to the hospital in his own car first. He couldn't help saying, "In our society, there is nothing more precious than people." Another time, seeing an old man on the road injured by a trolley car, the expert immediately got out of the car and walked, giving up his car to send the injured person. He also put forward many valuable suggestions on transportation safety measures.

    Transportation departments of enterprises in Benxi, Fushun, and Ganjingzi also came to ask the expert to help because of his reputation. In Fushun, a dilapidated mine had to spend 500,000 yuan to install a branch line on a high slope. The expert suggested that a certain factory in Shenyang could replace the dilapidated mine work, thus saving 500,000 yuan. Even when walking, the expert did not miss an opportunity to see what he could do for his Chinese friends. He saw piles of iron slag piled there, which was a pity, and when he came back, he wrote a letter of suggestion to the State Council, hoping to use these iron slag to make paving and building materials. It is said that the higher authorities have accepted the suggestion and asked the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Construction Engineering to handle this suggestion together.

    Interacting with children is one of the expert's greatest joys. Soon after arriving in Anshan, he wanted to find some children to interact with. People introduced him to No. 2 Middle School and Gangdu Elementary School. He spoke kindly to the children and immediately introduced them to establish communication with the children in Shatagil, Soviet Union. It turned out that he was once the protector of more than 400 children in the Shatagil Orphanage. When he thought of his 400 children, he often smiled affectionately: "I am a big father." Or, in his usual tone of boasting about Shatagil, which created the first steam locomotive, he would say, "Our children in Shatagil must be thinking about me. How much they hope I can go back soon so that I can tell them about the situation in China and the lives of Chinese children." Sometimes, he said nostalgically, "I should be returning to my country in December this year." The translator reminded him, "When you leave, the big and small friends here will miss you very much!" He suddenly put on a serious look and replied, "I will write to you often, but if you reply to my letters slowly, I will criticize you."

    This Soviet friend from Shatagil came to our country with lofty friendship in the severe winter; he will also leave China and return to the Soviet Union with infinite warmth in the season of severe winter. Two railway tracks are laid from China to the Soviet Union, and the long-tested friendship between the two peoples is even more continuous.

    来自夏塔吉尔的朋友
    草明
    虽然这儿是辽南地区，但天气已届严冬，冻的人们伸不出手；何况他是从寒冷的夏塔吉尔，穿过冰天雪地的西伯利亚、满洲里刚赶到这儿来的呢。这位苏联派来的运输专家一下火车，鞍钢运输部主任、工程师和技术员等人高兴得把他团团围住。还没有说上十句话，专家就突然请翻译同志向欢迎者们提出说他要出发巡视线路。大家一听都惊住了，因为大家都知道这位白发苍苍的人身体本来就不好，而且一连坐了八、九天火车，在车上又得了感冒病。于是，大家又是感动又是热切地去劝他。可是，他说他从接到命令那一天起，就时刻想着这是苏联人民叫他来帮助中国建设的。为了帮助建设第二个强大的社会主义国家，严寒算得了什么，况且欢迎的人们的热情早就把寒冷溶化掉了；八、九天的路程又算得了什么，在他心中，几千公里的途程只不过缩短为几秒钟工夫的距离罢了。“我怎能到这儿来休息？”人们费了好大的劲儿，才把他劝住了，陪伴他到了寓所。
    这样，米洛诺维奇同志第一次给人留下了深刻的印象。以后日子长久了，人们才逐渐了解他并不是生来性子急，对待工作，他都用这种顽强的精神。过新年时，领导干部都到现场值班，专家自告奋勇和中国同志一块儿值班。当大街小巷的人们互相庆祝新年时，专家正在现场照常工作。他笑着说：“我在这儿就好像在我们的夏塔吉尔一样。连这把小圆桌也和那边的一样。”三个月工夫，专家在鞍钢的三百六十多公里长的铁路线上留下了辛勤的脚印，他不仅熟悉什么时候在什么站运来了远从海南岛、江西、峰峰、抚顺等地的各种矿石和煤；并且还了解了某些站或段因耽误了时间，矿石运不进来，高炉在那儿待料；铁水供应不及时，炼钢工人在冒火；钢锭经常运到轧钢厂就发凉；而各地的厂、矿的定货运不出去，催促的电报如雪片飞来，使供应人员急了眼……经过仔细的分析和研究，专家认为这些原因大多数是人为的，也有的是因为过去的设备和规定赶不上鞍钢的改建和扩建的要求的。他分门别类提出了很多切实可行的建议。鞍钢的运输工作逐渐好转了。
    灵山站是鞍钢一个最重要的进出口站，但也是一个积压车皮最多的站，特别在夏天，矿石进量增加，车辆积压现象严重，曾经一昼夜间积压三百九十八辆车皮，几乎叫所有的堆货线路都堵塞住了。为了解决这个关键性问题，专家和站长徒步走到灵山站，一路走一路查看车辆到达的时刻，积压了多少时候和积压的原因。这天正下雨，把人们的衣服打湿了。站长为了爱护专家，劝他改天再来。专家笑着摇了摇头答道：“高炉不能饿着肚子等天晴呵。”专家找了个工友来，指着车皮问他为什么不卸那些车皮？工友回答说：“那门都锈住了，不好卸，我们就把它推在一边；先卸好卸的。”专家耐心地紧跟着问道：“你知不知道晚卸一个小时，国家要损失多少？”工友瞠目摇了摇头。专家点头对中国同志说：“怪不得工友，只怪我们没有对他们说清楚。”原来路局为了车辆周转灵便，曾规定了停留指标，过了指标，不仅要罚款；而因积压矿石和钢材延误了生产所招致的损失更大。
    整整劳累了一天，专家在夜里连忙起草建议，改进工作。领导干部按区域分工包干深入检查制度，三班“经济核算”板，和矿石场上的“货票箱”等等办法，都是这一阶段建立的。专家没有满足于这些制度的建立和它们所取得的成绩。他想，车皮虽有轱辘，但叫轱辘转动的却是人；与其说他对贯彻制度很热心，还不如说他对做“人”的工作更有兴趣一些。于是他利用了业余时间，每天提早一个多钟点来上班，轮流到各站、段去给工人讲课，讲缩短装卸时间给建设社会主义所带来的好处，讲铁路对社会主义的经济和文化生活的重要性，也讲到苏联卫国战争时期运输工人所起的巨大作用。工人们听的十分高兴，觉得自己的胳膊和双肩不仅扛得动百十斤的东西，而且也扛得起建设社会主义的责任。一两个月工夫，全线分散在三百多公里的九千多个职工，多半都听过专家的讲课。灵山站的装卸指标显著下降了。几月来完不成任务的，7、8月间已超额完成了。9月间，工人自动请求把定额再缩短一小时。灵山站的经验使人很兴奋，许多站、段都派人来学习。做支部工作、团的工作和工会工作的干部也愿意找专家谈谈，想知道夏塔吉尔那边的经验。国庆前夕，人们正准备向专家表示感谢的时候，却先收到专家的贺信。“我回去后一定把你们的成绩告诉苏联人，他们将会对中国工人兄弟们的成就引以自豪的。”——信里的话句句都打动工人们的心。
    有一天，一个运输工人受伤了，专家连忙乘车赶到现场。因急救车还没有来，专家坚决叫把自己乘的小车赶先送伤员到医院去。他情不自禁地说：“我们的社会里，再没有比人更宝贵的东西了。”又有一回，看见路上一个老百姓被电车碰伤，专家自己立刻下地步行，把车子让出来送伤者。他对运输上的安全的措施，也提出了许多宝贵的意见。
    本溪、抚顺、甘井子等地的企业运输部门也慕专家的名来请他去帮助。抚顺一个破矿场，因为要在高坡上安一条支线，得花五十万元钱，专家建议沈阳某场可以代替做破矿工作，于是把这五十万元节省下来了。即使在走路，专家也不放过一个机会看看自己能为中国朋友做点什么。他看见堆积如山的铁渣扔在那儿，十分可惜，回来便写了个建议书给国务院，希望能利用这些铁渣来做铺路和建筑材料。据说上级已接受建议，叫冶金工业部和建筑工程部会同来办理这项建议。
    和小朋友来往，是专家的一大乐事。他到鞍山不久，便要找些小朋友来往。人家介绍他到二中和钢都小学去，他和小朋友们亲切地讲了话，并立刻介绍他们和苏联夏塔吉尔的小朋友们建立了通讯关系。原来他曾是夏塔吉尔孤儿院的四百多个孩子的保护人。想起了他的四百多个孩子他常常亲昵地笑了：“我是个大爸爸。”或者用他惯用的，夸耀创造了第一个蒸汽火车头的夏塔吉尔的那样的口气说，“我们夏塔吉尔的孩子们该想我啦。他们多么盼望我快点回去，好把中国的情形和中国小朋友们的生活情形讲给他们听啊。”有时，他留恋地说：“今年12月我就该回国了。”翻译同志提醒他说：“你走了，这儿的大朋友们和小朋友们想你可会想坏的！”他忽然装起正经的样子答道：“我会经常给你们来信的，可是你们要是回我的信回慢了我可要批评的呢。”
    这位来自夏塔吉尔的苏联朋友，在严冬时带着崇高的友谊来到我国；他也将在严冬的时节，怀着无限的温暖离开中国返回苏联。两支铁轨从中国铺到苏联，两国人民的久经考验的友谊更是绵亘不断。
