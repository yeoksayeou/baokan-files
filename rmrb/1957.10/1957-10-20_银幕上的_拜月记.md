	The filmed version of "Romance of the Western Chamber by the Moon" is based on the Xiang Opera. The characters in the play are mostly played by famous Xiang Opera actors, who have received high praise in national or Hunan Province opera observation and performance events. The story of "Romance of the Western Chamber by the Moon" is very beautiful, and the singing and performances of the main characters, Xu Shaoqing, Peng Linong, and Liao Jianhua, are also very moving. From this play, we not only see the story of the joys and sorrows of a pair of lovers in feudal society and their spirit of unswerving loyalty to love, but also understand the snobbery, despicable and shamelessness of the powerful and influential from the side.

　　银幕上的“拜月记”
    搬上银幕的“拜月记”，是根据湘剧拍摄的。剧中人物的扮演者，大都是湘剧著名演员，他们在全国或湖南省的戏曲观摩会演中，都曾获得很高的评价。“拜月记”的故事十分优美，主角徐绍清、彭俐侬、廖建华等的歌唱、表演也很动人。从这个戏里，我们不仅看到封建社会里一对情人悲欢离合的故事，以及他们对于爱情的忠贞不二的精神，同时也从侧面理解到豪门将相的趋炎附势、卑劣无耻。
