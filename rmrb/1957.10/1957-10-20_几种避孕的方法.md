　　Several Methods of Contraception
　　Zhu Baocui
    Contraception is a matter of great concern to married people. They are very interested in knowing the answers to these questions: Exactly how many methods of contraception are currently available? Which methods are the most effective? What methods are currently being researched?
    Exactly how many methods of contraception are currently available? It is very difficult to answer this question accurately. According to the materials currently available, there are no fewer than several hundred contraceptive methods recorded in the literature, and those scattered among the people cannot be counted. However, some of these methods are incompletely recorded and cannot be blindly trusted; some have very little effect or are very inconvenient to use; and some have serious harm to human health and cannot be used. In short, although there are many contraceptive methods, most of them need to be researched and their effects determined before they can be promoted and used.
    The selection of contraceptive methods generally follows six principles: harmlessness, effectiveness, freedom, practicality, convenience, and economy. So, which contraceptive methods currently meet or come close to these six principles? According to medical research and the proven experience of many people: condoms, contraceptive suppositories, foam agents (i.e., contraceptive pills), vaginal plugs, diaphragms, and the safe period method are relatively ideal. Now, they are introduced in two categories: one category does not require a doctor's guidance and can be mastered by reading the instructions.
    Condom: Commonly known as a rubber, it is a cylindrical pouch made of rubber, transparent or translucent, and is a contraceptive tool for men. Before sexual intercourse, putting it on the man's penis can prevent semen from entering the woman's vagina and achieve the purpose of contraception. This is the simplest and easiest method. When purchasing and using condoms, you should pay attention to the production date and not buy ones that are too old. You should also be careful not to buy ones that are too small, as they can cause pain; and do not buy ones that are too large, as they may slip off during use. To ensure that the condom does not rupture during intercourse, carefully check the condom for pinholes or tears before each use. If the condom does not have a seminal vesicle, a small gap should be left at the front end for semen storage. At the same time, it would be even better if a layer of contraceptive jelly or water could be applied to the outside of the condom to increase lubrication. After use, wrap it in a damp towel, wash it the next day, and apply talcum powder in preparation for the next use.
    Contraceptive Suppositories: Also known as pessaries, they are drug granules made of phenylmercuric acetate and grease, packaged in tin foil or wax paper, slightly larger than peanuts. When using, first peel off the packaging paper, separate the vulva with one hand, and place the suppository into the bottom of the vagina with the other. It takes about ten minutes for the drug to melt and begin its spermicidal effect, at which point sexual intercourse can take place.
    Foam Agents: These are pills made by pressing contraceptive drugs, also known as contraceptive tablets. Place one tablet in the bottom of the vagina three to five minutes before each sexual intercourse. It is best to soak the tablet in water before inserting it. After the tablet is placed in the vagina, it forms a lot of foam with vaginal secretions, which spreads throughout the vagina and has the function of killing sperm and blocking sperm activity.
    Vaginal Plug: A three-inch square plug made of sterilized cotton or cloth, with a thick thread tied to the upper corner, soaked in contraceptive drugs, such as 1% acetic acid (dilute edible acid one to two times), or coated with salt paste, contraceptive jelly, placed at the bottom of the vagina, covering the cervix, can prevent sperm from entering the uterus. Take it out twelve hours after sexual intercourse, wash it, save it, and reuse it later. Salt paste is made by boiling one level spoonful of salt and one level spoonful of starch (arrowroot flour or rice flour are also acceptable) with nine spoonfuls of water. One preparation can be used for twenty times. This method is especially suitable for the needs of the vast rural population.
    The other category must be mastered after being guided by a doctor.
    Diaphragm: Also known as a cervical cap, it is a flat, round rubber cap with an elastic ring around the edge. When used with contraceptive jelly, it has a very high contraceptive effect and does not affect the pleasure of sexual intercourse. Although the price is relatively high, it can be used for one or two years if properly maintained. However, because each person's cervix and vagina are different, it is necessary to have a doctor examine and determine whether it can be used and what size diaphragm should be used when choosing a diaphragm, and also to learn how to use it. People with vaginal relaxation, uterine prolapse, cervicitis, and other diseases cannot use it.
    Safe Period Contraception: The main method is to find out the regularity of menstruation, determine the date of ovulation, and not have sexual intercourse during the possible fertile period to prevent the meeting of sperm and eggs. This is a very scientific method of contraception. However, because the ovulation period is not easy to grasp, it should be accurately recorded for half a year to a year under the guidance of a doctor before it can be used, and the doctor must be consulted at any time according to different situations, otherwise it is easy to fail.
    Although these methods can achieve the purpose of contraception and have very good results, the couple still needs to strictly adhere to the following points. First, contraception is a matter for both men and women, and the couple must cooperate, and neither party can be careless. Second, never listen to hearsay and abandon the current effective methods. Third, it is necessary to develop a habit and make it an indispensable part of life. Fourth, the contraceptive device must be carefully checked before and after use, and disinfected.
    As for the contraceptive methods currently being researched, there are oral anti-enzyme agents, sperm toxins, and traditional Chinese medicines. Some are still in the animal experiment stage and have not yet been clinically tested. Some have not been able to draw conclusions because the number of people tested is small, the observation time is short, and the experimental results of humans and animals are not completely consistent. The research on traditional Chinese medicine contraceptive drugs and methods is also in progress, but no conclusions can be drawn yet.

### 几种避孕的方法

　　几种避孕的方法
　　朱宝粹
    避孕是已婚的人所最关心的事情。他们很希望知道这几个问题：究竟目前有多少种避孕方法？哪些方法最为有效？正在研究的有哪些方法？
    究竟目前有多少种避孕方法呢？确切地回答这个问题是非常困难的。根据目前已有的材料来看，在文献上记载的避孕方法不下几百种，散在民间的无法统计。不过这些方法，有的记载不全，不可妄信；有的效用极小或使用非常不便；有的对人体健康有严重的危害，不能使用。总之，避孕的方法虽然不少，但大多需要进行研究和确定效果以后才能推广使用。
    避孕方法的选择，一般根据六项原则：无害、有效、自由、实用、方便、经济。那么，目前有哪些避孕方法合乎或者接近这六项原则呢？根据医学家的研究和经过许多人的实践证明：阴茎套、避孕拴剂、泡沫剂（即避孕药片）、阴道塞、阴道隔膜、安全期避孕法等比较合乎理想。现在分成两类来介绍，一类是不必找医生指导，看看说明书自己就可以掌握的。
    阴茎套  通常又称保险套，是一种用橡胶制成的透明或半透明的圆筒型的袋囊，是男用的避孕工具。性生活以前把它套在男子的阴茎上，便可以阻止精液射入女子的阴道而达到避孕的目的。这是一种最简便易行的方法。购买和使用阴茎套时，应注意出厂年月不可太久，还应当注意不要买太小的，太小会引起疼痛；也不要买太大的，太大在使用时会中途滑脱。为了保证阴茎套在性交中不致破裂，每次使用前应仔细检查阴茎套是否有沙眼或破裂现象，使用时阴茎套如无储精小囊，前端应当留出一点空隙以备储精之用，同时，在套的外面如能涂上一层避孕胶冻或水，增加一些湿润那就更好了。用完以后，包在湿手巾中，次日洗净，扑上滑石粉，准备下次再用。
    避孕拴剂  又称坐药，是一种用锡纸或蜡纸包装，比花生米略大的，由苯醋酸汞和油脂合成的药粒，使用时先把包装纸剥掉，一手分开外阴，一手将拴剂放入阴道底部，约需等十分钟药物已经融化后起杀精作用，此时才能性交。
    泡沫剂  就是用避孕药压制成的药片，又称避孕片剂，每次性生活前三至五分钟放入一片，置于阴道底部。药片放入前最好先在水中浸一浸。药片放入阴道后，便和阴道分泌物形成很多泡沫，扩散在阴道内，有杀灭精子和阻挡精子活动的功能。
    阴道塞  是用消毒棉花或布片做成一个三寸见方的塞子，上角拴一根较粗的线，浸透避孕药物，如1％的醋酸（食酸稀释一至二倍），或涂上食盐糊，避孕胶冻，放入阴道底部，盖在子宫口上，可以防止精虫进入子宫。性生活后十二小时取出，洗净保存，以后再用。食盐糊是用一平匙食盐和一平匙淀粉（菱粉、米粉都可以）加九匙水煮沸制成。一次制成可供二十次用，此法特别适合农村广大群众的需要。
    另一类是必须经医生指导以后才能掌握的。
    子宫隔膜  又称子宫帽，是一个扁圆形的橡皮帽，边缘上包有一个弹性环，配合避孕胶冻使用，避孕效果极高，同时不影响性生活的快感。虽然价格比较高一些，但保存得好可以使用一二年以上。不过由于各人的子宫颈和阴道情形不同，因此，在选择子宫隔膜时，必须经医生检查确定是否能用和应该采用何种号码的子宫隔膜，同时学习使用的方法。患有阴道松弛、子宫下垂、子宫颈炎等疾病的人不能使用。
    安全期避孕法  主要是找出月经的规律，确定排卵日期，在可能受孕期内不过性生活，不让精卵会合。这是很科学的避孕方法。但是由于排卵期不易掌握，因此应在医生指导下准确地先纪录半年到一年的月经周期，而后才能应用，并且随时还要根据不同情况请医生指导，否则容易失效。
    这些方法虽然都能达到避孕的目的，而且效果很好，但是还需要夫妇双方严格地做到以下几点。一、避孕是男女双方的事，夫妇必须合作，任何一方都不能疏忽大意。二、千万不要道听途说，放弃现行有效的方法。三、必须养成习惯，使成为生活中不可缺少的一部分。四、在使用前后必须仔细检查避孕用具，和做好消毒处理。
    至于目前正在研究的避孕方法，有口服抗酶剂、精子毒素和中药等，有的尚停留在动物实验阶段，尚未在临床试用。有的由于试用的人数不多，观察的时间比较短，人类和动物的实验结果不完全一致，所以还不能得出结论。中药避孕药物和方法的研究也正在进行，但也还不能作出结论。
