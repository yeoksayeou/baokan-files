Delegation Introduction
	Heroes and Models, Also Athletic Champions
	Introducing the Powerful People's Liberation Army Delegation
The People's Liberation Army (PLA) delegation is one of the strongest teams in this National Track and Field Competition. Many athletes have grown up in combat and training. In the delegation, 34% of the members are heroes and models.
Besides the two-thirds who are members of the "August 1st" track and field team, one-third of the PLA delegation consists of officers and soldiers with excellent performance recently transferred from various military units. Chen Yuxin, who was a farmer a year ago, is now a skilled discus thrower. This is enough to illustrate the development of sports in the PLA.
The comrades of the "August 1st" team have well developed the PLA's fine tradition of hard work and tenacity, and every athlete is very diligent and persistent. Huang Zhiyong, a sergeant from the Air Force, only started practicing 400-meter fast and 100-meter slow interval running in January this year. Initially, he could only do it 16 times, but by March, he had increased it to 30 times. In addition, he also regularly does cross-country running exercises of 40 to 50 kilometers. Generally speaking, an athlete's weight will decrease by one or two kilograms after running continuously for one or two hours. Such hard work is difficult to achieve without a particularly strong will.

    代表队介绍
    是功臣模范也是运动健将
    介绍实力雄厚的解放军代表队
    解放军代表队是这次全国田径赛实力较强的代表队之一。许多运动员是在战斗和训练中成长起来的。代表队中，有34％的队员都是功臣和模范。
    解放军代表队除了三分之二是“八一”田径队的队员，有三分之一却是最近从各部队抽调来的成绩优良的军官和士兵。陈愉锌，一年前还是一个种田的农民，现在已经是一个掷铁饼的能手了。这足以说明体育运动在解放军中的发展。
    “八一”队的同志们很好的发扬了解放军艰苦顽强的优良传统，每个运动员都很刻苦、顽强。空军上士黄志勇，他今年1月份才开始有计划的练习四百公尺快、一百公尺慢的变速跑，起初只能练十六次，到了3月份，已增加到能跑三十次了。此外他还经常作四十到五十公里的越野跑练习。一般说，一个运动员连续跑一两个小时之后，体重就要减轻一、二公斤。这样艰苦的劳动，如果没有特别坚强的意志是很难作到的。
