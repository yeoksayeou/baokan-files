Leziuskina, a Soviet expert, gifted a maternity kit to the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, in September 1955. To this day, it has been used to deliver more than 150 babies, all of whom are growing up healthy and strong. Mothers of all ethnic groups have named their children "Union," "Peace," and "Unity" to express the eternal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Granny Li Shuqing, who has a deep friendship with Leziuskina, still corresponds with her. Some time ago, Granny Li wrote to Leziuskina to tell her the good news that the entire village had implemented new midwifery methods.

In the autumn of 1955, Soviet expert Leziuskina came to the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative from Beijing to learn about maternal and child health work. Through the introduction of the Autonomous Region's health department, she met Granny Li Shuqing, who was learning new midwifery techniques at the cooperative. Through their conversations, Granny Li further realized the benefits of new midwifery methods and became even more determined to learn them. Granny Li led Leziuskina to visit the cooperative's midwifery kit and some housewives. Leziuskina taught Granny Li some knowledge about childbirth, pregnancy care, and new methods of childcare, and suggested that the agricultural cooperative build a new delivery room to protect the health of the mothers. Before leaving, Leziuskina encouraged Granny Li to work hard to serve women.

After Leziuskina returned to Beijing, she still missed the people here and Granny Li. She bought a maternity kit and sent it to the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative. The agricultural cooperative gave the maternity kit to Granny Li for use. At this time, Granny Li's daughter-in-law, who had lost her first four children, was about to give birth. The first use of the new midwifery method resulted in the safe delivery of her grandson. To not forget this friendship, Granny Li named her grandson "Union."

Half a year later, Leziuskina bought a set of baby clothes and asked someone to bring them from Beijing to Granny Li, as clothes for the first baby born after the agricultural cooperative built the delivery room.

The friendship of Soviet experts is forever imprinted in the hearts of the people here. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    列兹乌斯金娜和李大娘
    苏联专家列兹乌斯金娜，在1955年9月赠送给内蒙古呼和浩特市郊区光明农业社的一个产箱，到今天已经利用它接生一百五十多个婴儿了。这些婴儿个个长得很健壮。各民族母亲们把自己的儿女取名为“联盟”、“和平”、“团结”，表示中苏两国人民的永恒的友谊。和列兹乌斯金娜有深厚友谊的李恕清大娘，到现在还一直和她通信，前些日子，李大娘还把全村已经实现新法接生的喜讯写信告诉了列兹乌斯金娜。
    1955年秋天，苏联专家列兹乌斯金娜从北京来到光明农业社，了解妇幼卫生工作。经自治区卫生部门介绍，认识了这个社正在学习新接生法的李恕清大娘。从相互交谈中，李大娘进一步认识到新法接生的好处，更加坚定了学习新法接生的信心。李大娘领着列兹乌斯金娜参观了社里的接生包，访问了这里的一些家庭主妇。列兹乌斯金娜向李大娘传授了一些有关接产、保胎、新法育儿的知识，并建议农业社新修一间产房，以保障产妇们的健康。临别时，列兹乌斯金娜鼓励李大娘努力为妇女服务。
    列兹乌斯金娜回到北京以后，还念念不忘这里的人们和李大娘，她买了一个产箱寄送给光明农业社。农业社把这个产箱交给李大娘使用。这时，正好碰上李大娘过去生了四个孩子都相继死去的儿媳妇要分娩，第一次运用新法接生就使孙儿平安地生下来了。为了不忘这样友情，李大娘把孙儿取名为“联盟”。
    过了半年以后，列兹乌斯金娜又买了一套婴儿衣服，托人从北京带给李大娘，作为农业社在建立起产房后生下的第一个婴儿的衣服。
    苏联专家的友谊，永远烙印在这里人们的心里。　（据新华社讯）
