Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 13th, TASS dispatch: The President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, A.N. Nesmeyanov, said: Over the forty years since the October Revolution, Soviet science has played a remarkable role in building socialism. Its significance in communist construction is increasing year by year. The artificial Earth satellite is new proof of the unparalleled prosperity of Soviet science and technology.

Nesmeyanov spoke specifically to a TASS reporter about the development achievements of Soviet science over the past forty years. He pointed out that from the very first day of the Soviet regime, the founder of the Soviet state, the great Lenin, took resolute steps to promote the prosperity of the motherland's science.

Contribution to the Development of New Regions

Nesmeyanov said that Soviet scientists are now very actively participating in the work of developing new regions of great economic value to the Soviet Union. Through their comprehensive research, they can provide a scientific basis for solving such huge tasks as establishing new coal and steel bases east of Lake Baikal and developing the productive forces of the Amur River basin, the Great Turkestan area, and the Angara-Yenisei region. Therefore, the Party's policy of comprehensively developing the economies of various economic zones has led to the discovery of many new natural resources. It is difficult to predict in advance the true scale of these gifts of nature discovered by science for the benefit of mankind. For example, it is now known that the total geological reserves of coal in only two coalfields in the Krasnoyarsk Territory are 100 billion tons! The establishment of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is a significant event, indicating that the scientific, productive, and economic development of the vast and resource-rich regions of Northeast Soviet Union has reached a modern and very high level.

Nesmeyanov continued, saying that the brilliant achievements of Soviet scientists in mathematics, mechanics, aerodynamics, physics, chemistry, and electronics enable us to successfully solve the most complex problems in the development of electronics, metallurgy, machine manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing, radio technology, automation technology, and radio control technology, and to apply highly efficient technological processes in production. The vigorous development of rocket technology owes much to Tsiolkovsky, who laid the foundation for the theory of jet propulsion, as well as to the research of Zhukovsky and Chaplygin. Not long ago, the "Tu-104" aircraft and some new types of jet aircraft began flying on various routes. Intercontinental ballistic missiles have been manufactured. These days, the whole world is excited and encouraged by a major event – the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial Earth satellite. It can be boldly said that this event has opened a new era in the history of science.

Achievements in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy

When talking about the achievements in atomic energy and its peaceful utilization in recent years, Nesmeyanov pointed out, saying that Vavilov-Cherenkov's discovery of the effect, that is, the discovery of electron radiation exceeding the speed of light, is of extraordinary significance. Kurchatov determined the nuclear isomerism of artificial radioactive elements. The formulation of new acceleration principles and the manufacturing of powerful basic particle accelerators are the honor of Soviet physicists.

The President of the Academy pointed out that methods mastered before 1945 could not make protons produce energy exceeding ten million electron volts. Scientists in many countries were studying this problem. However, Veksler was the first to solve this problem. The method he formulated can increase the energy by a thousand times and more. Currently, all accelerators with energy above 100 million electron volts that have begun operation and are being equipped use the "automatic phase stabilization" method invented by Veksler. The world's largest accelerator with an energy of 10 billion electron volts, which began operating this year in Dubna, Soviet Union, was manufactured according to this principle.

Rapid Development of New Disciplines

Nesmeyanov said that new disciplines – biophysics and radiobiology – are developing rapidly. Radiophysics, radio technology, and electronics, in terms of their revolutionary prospects for technology, can be fully compared with nuclear physics and atomic electronics. After the October Revolution, the work of Soviet radio experts quickly made Soviet Russia the world's leading country in building large radio transmitters. In 1922, under the leadership of Bonch-Bruevich, the world's largest radiotelephone station at the time was established in the Nizhny Novgorod Radio Laboratory, which laid the foundation for development in this area.

Mandelstam's research on the speed of radio waves propagating along the Earth's surface opened up new ways to measure distances with radio rangefinders and promoted the development of radio navigation, radar, and radio measurement.

The paramagnetic resonance phenomenon discovered by Zavoisky in 1944 is a great discovery in radiophysics. Based on this discovery, new research methods have been formulated that can accurately measure a series of nuclear constants and provide valuable data on the nature of chemical coupling and molecular structure.

The molecular generators manufactured by the Physics Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Columbia University in the United States are important scientific achievements in the young scientific field of radio spectroscopy. This instrument, which uses the oscillation principle of the molecules themselves, provides great convenience for radio communication, radio navigation, and timekeeping.

As early as the initial years of the Soviet regime, semiconductor research was launched at the Leningrad Institute of Physics and Technology on the initiative of Ioffe. Based on the thermoelectric instruments for power generation, cooling, temperature control, and other purposes manufactured at the institute, thermal generators for radio receivers and broadcasting stations, and a series of cooling and temperature control devices for radio technology, meteorology, biology, agriculture, and daily life have been designed.

Due to the achievements of physics, and first of all the achievements of the theory of atoms and molecules, coupled with the development of new physical research methods, the Department of Physical Chemistry appeared, which was called Chemical Physics in the late 1920s. Academician Semyonov's school has made the greatest contribution to the development of chemical physics in the Soviet Union.

The achievements in studying the previously known but long-forgotten phenomenon of the ignition point of phosphorus vapor in 1926 were the driving force for formulating the theory of chain reactions. The basic principle of chain reactions was created by Semyonov in 1934.

Nesmeyanov said that modern geochemistry and biogeochemistry are of paramount importance to many departments of natural science, and the basic principles of geochemistry and the science of biogeochemistry were created by Vernadsky. In recent years, the geochemistry of uranium, thorium, and radium has developed. Geochemical methods for exploring mineral deposits and non-metallic mineral deposits – metallometry, hydrogeochemical survey, biogeochemical survey, and gas measurement – are now being formulated and practically applied.

Geological Science Helps Develop Treasures

The achievements of Soviet geological science are particularly evident in the research and mastery of many coalfields, oil fields, iron ore deposits, and non-ferrous metal deposits (copper, zinc, lead, etc.), as well as rare metal deposits (tungsten, vanadium, etc.) that were little understood in the era of Tsarist Russia. The Soviet rare metal industry is developing rapidly on the basis of domestic raw materials. It should be pointed out that several huge diamond deposits have been discovered in Yakutia in recent years. Soviet exploration methods have been applied to all regions of the entire country and have penetrated into areas that science could not reach in the past. Using this method, many new natural phenomena have been discovered, and the "blank spots" on land and sea maps have been eliminated.

Nesmeyanov emphasized that in 1947 the Soviet Union began using rockets to study the upper atmosphere. The Soviet Union launched rockets with special equipment and obtained data on the atmosphere at an altitude of 100 kilometers. Subsequently, Soviet scholars designed special rockets, which were later used to systematically study the upper atmosphere. By comparing the data on the upper atmosphere obtained by rockets with the phenomena of solar activity, Soviet scientists elucidated a series of geophysical phenomena in a new way.

Antarctic Exploration Work is Very Rewarding

Soviet scientists have studied the entire polar region using floating stations and the new method of extensively using flying observatories, discovering and investigating the huge Lomonosov underwater ridge that extends from the New Siberian Islands to the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Antarctica is being examined in detail. Glaciologists and geophysicists have obtained particularly important new data on the structure and changes of ice layers. It has now been determined that the ice layer in Antarctica is much thicker than previously imagined, and that hundreds of kilometers inland from the edge of the Antarctic ice layer, what is covered by the ice layer is not land, but the seabed.

Nesmeyanov said that the enormous tasks currently facing science require the active participation of nearly four million scientists nationwide. This is a huge and powerful force educated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the spirit of true internationalism and the friendship of all nationalities, dedicating their strength to the common cause of communist construction and consolidating the Soviet state.

In the forty years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the number of staff members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has increased one hundredfold, the budget has almost increased a thousandfold, and the scientific publications published in 1956 amounted to 29,000 author's sheets, compared with only 627 author's sheets in 1917. As a result of the continuous and creative implementation of Lenin's national policy, science in the Soviet Union has greatly prospered. The thirteen academies of sciences in various union republics (a product of the Soviet regime) have become huge scientific research centers, contributing many discoveries of paramount significance to the world.

　　苏联体现列宁理想攀登科学高峰
    四百万科学家正在献身共产主义建设事业
    据新华社13日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫说：十月革命四十年来，苏联科学在建成社会主义中起了卓越的作用。它在共产主义建设中的意义正在逐年增长。人造地球卫星是苏联科学和技术无比繁荣的新证明。
    ?斯米扬诺夫专门对塔斯社记者谈到了苏联科学四十年来的发展成就。他指出，从苏维埃政权成立的第一天起，苏维埃国家的缔造者、伟大的列宁就采取了繁荣祖国科学的坚决步骤。
    对开发新地区的贡献
    ?斯米扬诺夫说，苏联科学家现在十分积极地参加了开发在苏联经济上很有价值的新地区的工作。经过他们的全面研究，可以为解决这样一些巨大任务提供科学基础：在贝加尔湖以东建立新的煤钢基地发展阿穆尔河流域、大土尔阶、安加拉——叶尼塞地区的生产力。因此，党所制定的全面发展各经济区的经济的方针，使许多新的自然财富被发现了。很难预先估计，这些被科学发现出来为人们造福的自然界的礼物的真正规模有多大。譬如，现在才知道，仅是克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区的两个煤田的煤的总的地质储量就有一千亿吨！苏联科学院西伯利亚总分院的成立是一件意义重大的事，这件事表明苏联东北的广大富饶地区的科学——生产和经济开发具有现代的非常高度的水平。
    ?斯米扬诺夫接着说，苏联科学家在数学、力学、空气动力学、物理学、化学、电子学方面的辉煌成就，使我们能够顺利地解决发展电子学、冶金、机器制造、飞机制造、无线电技术、自动化技术和无线电操纵技术中最复杂的问题，能够在生产中运用效率极高的工艺过程。火箭技术的蓬勃发展在许多方面都要归功于奠定了喷气推进理论基础的齐奥尔科夫斯基，以及茹科夫斯基和查普利金的研究。不久以前，“图一一○四”飞机和一些新型的喷气式飞机已经开始在各航线飞行。洲际弹道火箭已经制成。这些天来，全世界都为一件大事——苏联发射人造地球卫星而兴奋鼓舞。可以大胆地说，这件事在科学史上开辟了新纪元。
    和平利用原子能的成就
    在谈到最近几年在原子能和它的和平利用方面的成就时，?斯米扬诺夫指出，他说，瓦维洛夫——契连科夫对效能的发现，即超过光速的电子辐射的发现，只有卓越的意义。库尔查托夫确定了人造放射性原素的核的同分异构。新的加速原理的制定和强大的基本粒子加速器的制成，是苏联物理学家们的荣誉。
    这位科学院院长指出，1945年以前所掌握的方法不能使质子产生超过一千万电子伏特的能量。许多国家的科学家都在研究这个问题。但是，维克斯列尔首先解决了这个问题。他制订的方法能够把能量提高到一千倍和一千倍以上。目前，一切已经开始运动和正在装备的能量在一亿电子伏特以上的加速器，都利用维克斯列尔发明的“自动定相”法。今年在苏联杜布诺开始运转的世界上最大的能量为一百亿电子伏特的加速器就是根据这个原理制成的。
    新的科门迅速发展
    ?斯米扬诺夫说，新的科门——生物物理学和放射性生物学正在迅速地发展着。放射物理学、无线电技术和电子学在对技术有革命意义的前景方面，完全可以同原子核物理学、原子电子学相比拟。十月革命以后，苏联的无线电专家的工作很快就使苏俄在建造大型的无线电发报机方面跃居世界首位。1922年，在邦奇——布鲁也维奇的领导下，在下戈罗德斯卡亚无线电实验室建立了当时世界上最大的无线电话站，这就奠定了在这方面发展的开端。
    曼杰尔斯塔姆关于无线电波沿地球表面传播速度的研究，为用无线电测距计测量距离开辟了新的途径，并促进了无线电导航学、雷达学和无线电测量学的发展。
    1944年扎沃伊斯基发现的顺磁性谐振现象，是放射物理学方面的一项伟大发现。根据这一发现制定了新的研究方法，这种方法能够准确地测量一系列的核常数，并且可以提供有关化学偶合性质和分子结构的宝贵资料。
    苏联科学院物理研究所和美国哥伦比亚大学制造的分子发生器是年轻的科学领域——放射光谱学的重要科学成果之一。这个利用分子本身摆动原理的仪器给无线电通讯、无线电导航和报时工作提供了很大方便。
    远在苏维埃政权的最初年代，根据约费的倡议，在列宁格勒物理技术研究所展开了半导体的研究工作。在该所制造的为发电、冷却、恒温和其它目的用的热电仪器基础上，已经设计了无线电接收机和广播电台用的热发生器和一系列无线电技术、气象学、生物学、农业以及日常生活用的冷却装置和恒温装置。
    由于物理学的成就，而首先是原子和分子理论的成就，再加上新的物理研究方法的发展，导致了物理化学部门的出现，在二十年代末期这个部门被称为化学物理学。苏联对化学物理学的发展贡献最大的是谢苗诺夫院士学派。
    1926年，在研究以前人所共知的、但久已被人遗忘的磷的蒸汽燃点现象方面所获得的成就，是制定链锁反应理论的推动力。链锁反应的基本原理是谢苗诺夫在1934年创立的。
    ?斯米扬诺夫说，现代地球化学和生物地球化学对自然科学许多部门具有头等重要意义，而地球化学的基本原理和生物地球化学这门科学都是维尔纳茨基创立的。近年来，铀、钍、镭地球化学有了发展。现在正在制定和实际运用勘查矿藏和非金属矿藏的地球化学方法：金属测定法、水文地球化学测定法、生物地球化学测定法和气体测定法。
    地质科学帮助了开发宝藏
    苏联地质科学的成就特别明显地表现在研究和掌握了许多煤田、油田、铁矿床和有色金属矿床（铜、锌、铅等），以及在沙皇俄国时代很少了解的稀有金属矿床（钨、钒等）。苏联稀有金属工业正在国产原料基础上迅速发展。应当指出，近几年来在雅库特发现了若干巨大金刚石矿床。苏联的勘测方法运用到了整个国家的一切地区，并深入到科学在过去无法达到的地区。用这种方法发现了许多新的自然现象，消灭了陆地地图和海洋地图的“空白点”。
    ?斯米扬诺夫强调说，1947年苏联就开始了用火箭研究大气上层。苏联发射了有特殊装备的火箭，获得了一百公里高空的大气层的资料。随后，苏联学者又设计了专门的火箭，这种火箭后来就被用于系统地研究大气层上面。把用火箭获得的大气上层的资料同太阳活动性的现象加以比较，苏联科学家按新的方式阐明了一系列地球物理现象。
    南极考察工作大有收获
    苏联科学家用漂浮站和广泛地运用飞行观象台的新方法，已经研究了整个极地地区，发现并且考察了从新西伯利亚群岛伸展到加拿大群岛的巨大的罗蒙诺索夫水下山脊。南极正在被详细考察。冰川学家和地球物理学家获得了有关冰层的结构和变动的特别重要的新资料。目前已经确定，南极的冰层要比以往推想的要厚得多，从南极冰层的边缘深入内地数百公里，一路上冰层所掩盖的不是陆地，而是海底。
    ?斯米扬诺夫说，科学目前所面临的巨大任务，要求我们全国将近四百万科学家积极参加这一工作。这是苏联共产党以真正国际主义和各族人民友好精神教育出来的庞大有力的队伍，他们把自己的力量献给共产主义建设的共同事业和巩固苏维埃国家。
    苏维埃政权成立四十年来，苏联科学院的工作人员数目增加到一百倍，预算几乎增加到一千倍，1956年出版的科学刊物二万九千著作页，而在1917年仅六百二十七著作页。由于不断地创造性地实现列宁的民族政策的结果，苏联的科学大加繁荣。各加盟共和国的十三个科学院（苏维埃政权的产物）已经变成了巨大的科学研究中心，向全世界贡献出许多有头等意义的发现。
