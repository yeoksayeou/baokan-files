Right-wing elements in the publishing industry, such as Zeng Yansheng, Lan Yu, and Peng Zigang, have been vehemently opposing the implementation of socialist planning in the publishing business. They argue that planning "stifles individual initiative" and that "subject selection plans are completely unnecessary." Lan Yu deliberately portrays the publishing work since liberation as "full of contradictions" and "full of jokes," attributing it to the planned nature of the publishing industry. They especially attack the planned paper supply system, putting forward absurd propositions of so-called "free trade" and "free publishing."

It should be acknowledged that there have been many errors and shortcomings in publishing work in the past and present. This is prominently manifested in insufficient attention to improving the quality of books, and the frequent occurrence of some books being overstocked or in short supply. Some of these phenomena are due to objective reasons such as the weak material and cultural foundation of the entire country and a lack of experience in our work, which are difficult to completely avoid in the short term. However, some are also due to subjectivism and bureaucracy in our thinking and work style, failing to pay attention to studying the Party's propaganda and education policies, understanding the situation in the writing and translation circles, and investigating the actual needs of the state and the people for books. As a result, the planning work is not done well, or the planning requirements are too high, too rigid, and too strict, lacking flexibility in execution. This should be diligently improved. However, if we do not implement socialist planning and adopt a laissez-faire approach, the overstocking and undersupply of books will certainly become more serious. Looking back to before liberation, when China's publishing industry was in a state of capitalist anarchy, it was truly a case of extreme scarcity and oversupply, which is the best proof.

In any case, the achievements of planning in publishing work are still the main aspect. It enables us to publish books in a planned, proportional, and focused manner according to the Party and the state's political tasks and propaganda and education policies in a given period, to develop science and culture, to serve socialist transformation and socialist construction, and to reasonably meet the cultural needs of the people. The needs of the state and the people for books are often multifaceted, but there are different priorities in different periods, and we have basically taken care of this. In addition to generally publishing various social science, natural science, cultural education, and literary and artistic books, in the early days of liberation, we published a large number of books promoting Marxism and the Party's policies; starting in 1953, we increased the publication of many science and technology books; and after 1956, under the guidance of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, we increased the publication of ancient and modern Chinese and foreign academic works and literary works, promoting the prosperity of science and culture. It has enabled us to rapidly build up a socialist publishing industry. In 1956, the number of books printed increased ninefold compared to 1936. This publishing institution was able to publish and print them and distribute them widely to workers, farmers, and intellectuals. This would not have been possible without our implementation of planned construction.

Right-wing elements negate the planning of publishing work, oppose publishing plans and subject selection plans, emphasize so-called "democracy" and "freedom," and advocate publishing whatever readers want. Their purpose is to negate the Party's leadership and the ideological guidance of Marxism, so that publishing work is in a state of capitalist free competition and anarchy, in order to peddle bourgeois private goods and pave the way for capitalist restoration.

The Party's leadership is realized in many aspects through economic construction plans and cultural construction plans. Publishing plans and subject selection plans embody the direction and goals of book publishing, arrange the proportions of various types of books in terms of variety and quantity, and put forward certain requirements for the content and quality of books. Of course, such plans often need to be adjusted as necessary according to the actual situation in the process of implementation. Without such necessary plans to exert their guiding, controlling, and regulating role, book publishing will lose its direction and goals, be in a state of anarchic chaos, and the Party's leadership and the ideological guidance of Marxism will not be guaranteed.

In class society, generally speaking, books and periodicals are tools of class struggle, serving to consolidate the economic base of a specific society and its superstructure. Therefore, as reflected in the publication of books, there has never been absolute freedom, only relative freedom. Chairman Mao said: "In fact, there is only concrete freedom and concrete democracy in the world, and no abstract freedom or abstract democracy. In a society of class struggle, if the exploiting class has the freedom to exploit the working people, the working people do not have the freedom not to be exploited. If the bourgeoisie has democracy, the proletariat and the working people do not have democracy." The entire publishing history of China proves the correctness of this thesis. In feudal society, emperors and nobles could freely use state funds to publish books praising feudal rule, while books published by the people that slightly offended the dignity of the feudal rulers were listed as banned books. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the market was flooded with Hitler's "Mein Kampf," Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny," and "persuasion books" that promoted feudal superstitions and pornographic books that incited prostitution and theft, while Marxist scientific works and progressive literary works had little or no opportunity to be published, and were often censored after they had been published. In the new China of the people's democratic dictatorship, the people have the greatest freedom of publication, and the bourgeoisie also enjoys the part of the freedom of publication that they can have. However, we have already seen that when the bourgeois right-wingers launched an anti-Communist upsurge, they even tampered with the political direction of the Guangming Daily, Wenhui Daily, New Observer, and many other publications. The right-wing elements of the Hubei People's Publishing House planned to publish "Tales of Knights-Errant of the Rivers and Lakes," and the Wenhui Daily even made a big fuss about it. That is to say, they want to expand the bourgeois freedom of publication, reduce the freedom of publication of the proletariat and other working people, publish more books and periodicals promoting capitalism, and publish fewer books and periodicals promoting socialism. This most clearly illustrates the class nature of book and periodical publishing, and the struggle between the two roads reflected in the publishing business. Therefore, in a socialist country, freedom of publication, like other democratic freedoms, should be freedom with leadership. To achieve leadership, it is necessary to implement necessary planning and control.

The needs of readers are something that publishing organizations should constantly consider. Therefore, we always advocate that publishing organizations and distribution agencies investigate the real needs of readers. However, readers have many different classes and strata, with different thoughts and feelings, and their needs are different. The needs of readers are mostly reasonable, but there will also be unreasonable and even unhealthy parts. In the previous period, when the sky was full of dark clouds, some right-wing elements and some young people who were confused by the right-wing elements demanded that the state open banned books. What are the so-called banned books? As far as we know, since liberation, a batch of books that the state has banned in relatively large quantities are pornographic books left over from the old society. Such books will poison the souls of young people, harm their physical health, entice them to embark on the path of corruption and degeneration, and even corrupt social morality and disrupt public order. It is entirely necessary for the government to ban such pornographic books in order to protect the interests of the state and the people. Their demand to open banned books is wrong. Such improper demands should not be met. From this, it can be seen that the needs of readers are a factor or aspect that we should consider, but it cannot be used as the entire basis for book publishing. We must also simultaneously study the requirements of the country's revolutionary and construction undertakings and the Party's propaganda and education policies. In our country, the interests and demands of the state are basically consistent with the interests and demands of the vast majority of readers. However, sometimes, the interests and demands of some readers, even if they are correct, may have certain conflicts with the needs and possibilities of the state. Therefore, the Party must strengthen its leadership over book publishing and realize this leadership through necessary plans, and cannot adopt a laissez-faire policy of "publishing whatever readers want."

The right-wing elements oppose the planning of publishing work because they attempt to transform the socialist publishing industry into a capitalist publishing industry, in order to serve imperialism, landlords, and the bourgeoisie. In recent years, the construction of the publishing industry, although there are some unreasonable or inappropriate aspects, has been carried out in a planned manner in coordination with the country's planned economic construction, basically meeting the requirements of the Party and the state for propaganda and education and the people's cultural life. In this new type of socialist publishing industry, local publishing houses and professional publishing houses occupy an important position. The old capitalist publishing enterprises have also undergone socialist transformation and become an important component of China's entire publishing industry. However, the right-wing elements believe that this set of publishing industries restricts their "freedom" and "enthusiasm," making it impossible for them to publish whatever they want and freely peddle private goods and spread poison. Therefore, they oppose planned construction, demand leaving the socialist track, opening up a "free market," establishing so-called "cooperative publishing houses" that are not led by the Party, or fundamentally disrupting the existing publishing industry, compressing a batch, merging a batch, and restoring and establishing a batch of private publishing houses. That is to say, they want to restore the capitalist publishing industry and weaken or even eliminate the socialist publishing industry. Everyone knows that books are powerful tools for propaganda and education, and publishing houses are important cultural and educational institutions. In people's democratic countries, this undertaking must be led and controlled by the Party and the state in order to serve the working people and socialist construction. In the early days of liberation, there were many capitalist publishing houses privately run by bourgeois elements in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. History has proved that they cannot meet the requirements of building a new national culture of socialism; and most of them, due to their exploitative class stance and profit-seeking ideas, published a large number of books promoting reactionary feudal ideas and bourgeois ideas, harming the interests of the state and the people. Therefore, they had to accept transformation or be eliminated. Today, when the socialist system has been established, the capitalist ownership system has been changed, and the positive role of capitalism in China's history has been fully played, the right-wing elements are actually attempting to restore the capitalist publishing industry. This can only be explained by their resolute opposition to the socialist revolutionary and construction undertakings, wanting to expand the propaganda of capitalist ideas, and making society regress.

The right-wing elements particularly fiercely oppose the planned supply system of news and publishing paper, demanding the free buying and selling of paper in order to engage in speculation, control publishing material resources, expand capitalist propaganda, and attack the socialist ideological front. Article 87 of the Constitution stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, procession, and demonstration. The state provides the necessary material facilities to guarantee that citizens enjoy these freedoms." The citizens mentioned here include the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals in a state of transition. The state also provides a part of the necessary material conditions for their freedom of publication. Bourgeois academic works and literary works have the opportunity to be published; bourgeois newspapers and periodicals have also received the state's allocation of paper. Naturally, because China is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, a socialist society, and because China's paper resources are insufficient, there must be certain restrictions on their paper supply. The bourgeois right-wing elements believe that this measure is very unfavorable to them, restricting their "freedom" and "enthusiasm" to promote capitalism. Therefore, they have been trying every means to overthrow the planned paper supply system. When the Wenhui Daily tampered with its direction and wantonly spread poison, they made a big fuss about the paper issue on the one hand, and deliberately ignored the government's regulations and arbitrarily increased the number of pages and copies, destroying the planned paper supply and the planned distribution system of newspapers and periodicals, which was not without reason. Because they understand that they must first break through the planned supply system and control paper resources in order to completely usurp the socialist publishing industry.

From this rampant attack by the bourgeois right-wing elements, it can be seen that they are attempting to first seize the leadership of the cultural and educational circles, seize the ideological propaganda front, influence the people with bourgeois ideology, change the people's spiritual outlook, lay the ideological foundation for their counter-revolutionary restoration, and then stage a "Hungarian event second" in China, a country with a population of 600 million, seize the entire leadership of the country, and drag China back to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. Seizing the leadership of the publishing industry is precisely a part of this conspiracy, and opposing planning is one of the important steps in this conspiracy. Therefore, adhering to the planning of publishing work and opposing the planning of publishing work reflects the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. In such a serious struggle, it is necessary to firmly maintain the principled stand, distinguish between right and wrong, and resolutely oppose the right-wing's impact on the socialist ideological front.

Planning is an indispensable link in the socialist system. Although the degree and items of planning may vary depending on the circumstances, the principles and basic system of planning must be adhered to. However, some comrades, because their class stance is not firm, or their political awareness is not high, and they are not good at analyzing things from a class perspective, regard the issue of planning as a technical issue, and thus waver in the struggle of such major principled issues, making unprincipled concessions to the bourgeoisie, and even believing that in the future, the publication and distribution of books can be done without asking about the content and quality, and without any control at all. This idea and practice is very wrong. This shows that there are still bourgeois ideas in many of our comrades. Therefore, they cannot distinguish between bourgeois democracy and freedom and proletarian democracy and freedom, and are often deceived by the rhetoric of right-wing elements. After this anti-rightist struggle, we understand that there is a fundamental difference between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat on principled issues. We should always be vigilant so as not to lose our way in the great storm.

    出版工作必须实行计划化
    陈克寒
    出版界的右派分子曾彦修、蓝钰、彭子冈等人，都竭力反对出版事业实行社会主义的计划化。他们认为：计划化“把个人的积极性限死了”；“选题计划根本不必要”。蓝钰故意把解放以后的出版工作描绘成“矛盾百出”、“笑话百出”，并且把它归咎于出版事业的计划化。他们特别攻击纸张的计划供应制度，提出所谓“自由买卖”、“自由出版”的荒谬主张。
    应该承认，过去和现在出版工作是有许多错误和缺点的。这突出地表现于对于书籍的质量的提高不够重视，并且时常出现一部分书籍积压或不足的现象。这种现象有些是由于整个国家物质文化基础薄弱和工作中缺乏经验等客观原因造成的，是一时难以完全避免的。但也有些是由于我们思想作风上存在着主观主义和官僚主义的毛病，不注意研究党的宣传教育方针，了解著作界翻译界的情况，调查国家和人民对于书籍的实际需要，因而计划工作作得不好，或者计划化的要求过高过死过严，在执行中缺乏机动性、灵活性所致。这是应该努力改进的。但是，如果我们不实行社会主义计划化，采取放任自流办法，那末，书籍的积压和脱销一定会更加严重。回顾解放以前，当我国出版事业处于资本主义的无政府状态时，才真是奇缺大滥，就是最好的证明。
    无论如何，出版工作的计划化，成绩还是主要的。它使我们能够根据党和国家一定时期的政治任务和宣传教育方针，有计划地按比例地有重点地出版书籍，发展科学和文化，为社会主义改造和社会主义建设服务，并且合理地满足人民群众的文化需要。国家和人民对于书籍的需要经常地是多方面的，但各个时期又有不同的重点，这，我们基本上照顾到了。除了一般地出版各种社会科学、自然科学、文化教育、文学艺术书籍以外，在解放初期，我们大量地出版了宣传马克思主义和党的政策的书籍；1953年开始，我们增出过许多科学技术书籍；1956年以后，在“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针指导下，我们增出了古今中外学术著作和文学著作，推动科学文化的繁荣。它使我们迅速地建设起社会主义的出版事业，1956年书籍的印行数量比1936年增加了九倍，这套出版机构能够把它们出版印刷出来，并且广泛地发行到工人、农民和知识分子的手中。要不是我们实行有计划的建设，是不可能办到的。
    右派分子否定出版工作计划化，反对出版计划和选题计划，强调所谓“民主”“自由”，提倡读者要什么出什么，其目的，是要否定党的领导和马克思主义的思想指导，使出版工作处于资本主义自由竞争的无政府状态，以便倾销资产阶级的私货，为资本主义复辟开辟道路。
    党的领导许多方面是要通过经济建设计划和文化建设计划来实现的。出版计划和选题计划体现了书籍出版的方针和目标，安排了各类书籍出版在品种上、数量上的比例，并且对于书籍的内容和质量提出一定的要求。当然，这种计划，在执行过程中，常常需要根据实际情况，作某些必要的调整。没有这种必要的计划，发挥它们的指导、控制和调节作用，书籍出版就会失去方向和目标，处于无政府的混乱状态，党的领导和马克思主义的思想指导也就没有保证。
    在阶级社会，一般讲，书刊是阶级斗争的工具，是为巩固特定的社会的经济基础和它的上层建筑服务的。因而体现在书籍的出版上，从来就只有相对的自由，没有绝对的自由。毛主席说过：“实际上，世界上只有具体的自由，具体的民主，没有抽象的自由，抽象的民主。在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主。”中国的全部出版史，证明了这个论断的正确。在封建社会，帝王贵族可以有以国帑出版歌颂封建统治书籍的自由，而民间出版的书籍稍一触犯封建统治者的尊严就被列为禁书。在国民党反动统治时期，市场上泛滥着希特勒的“我的奋斗”，蒋介石的“中国之命运”，以及宣扬封建迷信的“劝善书”和诲淫诲盗的黄色书刊，而马克思主义科学著作和进步文学作品却没有或很少出版的机会，而且在已经出版以后还常常遭到查禁。在人民民主专政的新中国，人民有了最广大的出版自由，资产阶级也享受到了他们可有的那一部分出版自由。但是，我们已经看到：当资产阶级右派发动反共高潮的时候，他们竟然篡改了光明日报、文汇报、新观察以及其他不少刊物的政治方向，湖北人民出版社的右派分子打算出版“江湖奇侠传”，而文汇报还为之大吹大擂地宣传。就是说，他们要扩张资产阶级的出版自由，缩小无产阶级和其他劳动人民的出版自由，多出宣传资本主义的书刊，少出宣传社会主义的书刊。这就最明显地说明了书刊出版的阶级性，和在出版事业方面所反映的两条道路的斗争。所以，在社会主义国家，出版自由同其他的民主自由一样，应该是有领导的自由。而要实现领导，就要实行必要的计划和控制。
    读者的需要是出版机关应该经常地考虑到的。所以，我们总是提倡出版机关和发行机构调查读者真实的需要状况。但是，读者有许多不同的阶级和阶层，具有不同的思想和感情，他们的需要是不同的。读者的需要多数是合理的，但也会有不合理乃至不健康的部分。前一个时期，当天空中乌云乱翻的时候，某些右派分子和某些受到右派迷惑的青年，曾经提出要求国家开放禁书。所谓禁书是什么书呢？据我们所知道，解放以来，国家比较大量地查禁的一批书籍，就是旧社会所遗留下来的黄色书刊。这种书刊会毒害青年的灵魂，戕害身体健康，勾引他们走上腐化堕落的道路，乃至败坏社会公德，破坏公共秩序。政府为了保障国家和人民的利益，查禁这种黄色书刊是完全必要的。他们要求开放禁书是错误的。对于这种不正当的要求不应该予以满足。由此可见，读者的需要是我们应该考虑的一个因素或一个方面，但还不能作为书籍出版的全部依据，我们还必须同时研究国家的革命事业和建设事业的要求和党的宣传教育政策。在我们的国家里，国家的利益和要求同绝大多数读者的利益和要求，是基本上一致的。但是，在有的时候，一部分读者的利益和要求即使是正确的，也可能同国家的需要和可能发生一定的矛盾。因此，党必须加强对于书籍出版的领导，并且通过必要的计划来实现这种领导，而不能采取“读者要什么出什么”的放任自流政策。
    右派分子反对出版工作计划化，还在于企图把社会主义的出版事业，改变成为资本主义的出版事业，以便为帝国主义、地主、资产阶级服务。几年来，出版事业的建设，虽然有某些不合理或不恰当的地方，但它是配合着国家的计划经济建设有计划地进行的，基本上适应党和国家的宣传教育以及人民文化生活的要求。在这套新型的社会主义出版事业中，地方出版社和专业出版社占有重要的地位。旧的资本主义的出版企业也已经实行社会主义改造，成为我国整个出版事业的一个重要的组成部分。但是右派分子认为这一套出版事业限制了他们的“自由”和“积极性”，使他们不能高兴出什么就出什么，自由地倾销私货和散传毒素。因此，他们反对计划建设，要求离开社会主义的轨道，开放“自由市场”，成立不受党领导的所谓“同人出版社”；或者把现有的出版事业根本打乱，压缩一批，裁并一批，恢复和建立一批私营出版社。就是说，要恢复资本主义出版事业，削弱以至最后消灭社会主义出版事业。谁都知道，书籍是强有力的宣传教育的工具，出版社是重要的文化教育机关。在人民民主国家，这种事业必须由党和国家领导和掌握，以便为劳动人民和社会主义建设服务。解放初期，北京、上海等地，曾经有许多资产阶级分子私人经营的资本主义性质的出版社，历史证明它们不能适应建设社会主义的民族的新文化的要求；而且其中绝大部分由于他们的剥削阶级立场和唯利是图观念，出版了大量的宣传反动的封建思想和资产阶级思想的书籍，损害了国家和人民的利益。因此，它们不得不接受改造或被淘汰。在今天，社会主义制度已经建立，资本主义所有制已经改变，资本主义在我国历史上的积极作用已经发挥完了的时候，右派分子竟然企图恢复资本主义的出版事业，这除了说明他们坚决反对社会主义的革命事业和建设事业，想要扩张资本主义思想的宣传，使得社会倒退以外，再也得不到其他解释。
    右派分子特别激烈地反对新闻出版用纸的计划供应制度，要求纸张的自由买卖，以便进行投机倒把，掌握出版的物质资源，扩大资本主义宣传，打击社会主义思想阵地。宪法第八十七条规定：“中华人民共和国公民有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威的自由。国家供给必需的物质上的便利，以保证公民享受这些自由。”这里所说的公民是包括处于过渡状态的资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子在内的。国家对于他们的出版自由也是提供了一部分必需的物质条件的。资产阶级的学术著作和文艺著作得到出版的机会；资产阶级的报纸刊物也得到了国家的纸张的配给。自然，由于中国是一个工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政国家，是一个社会主义制度的社会，也由于中国的纸张资源不足，对于他们的纸张供应不能不有一定的限制。资产阶级右派分子认为这个措施对于他们十分不利，限制了他们宣传资本主义的“自由”和“积极性”，因此，千方百计地图谋推翻纸张的计划供应制度。当文汇报篡改方向大肆放毒的时候，他们一面在纸张问题上大做文章，一面故意无视政府的规定，任意增加篇幅和份数，破坏纸张计划供应和报刊计划发行制度，不是没有原因的。因为他们懂得，必须首先冲破计划供应制度，掌握纸张资源，才能完全篡夺社会主义出版事业。
    从这次资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻中可以看到：他们是企图首先夺取文化教育界的领导权，掌握思想宣传阵地，以资产阶级思想来影响人民，改变人民的精神面貌，为他们的反革命复辟打下思想基础，然后在中国这样一个六亿人口的国家来一个“匈牙利事件第二”，夺取国家的全部领导权，把中国拉回到半殖民地半封建社会。夺取出版事业的领导权，正是这种阴谋计划的一部分，而反对计划化又是这个阴谋的重要步骤之一。因此，坚持出版工作的计划化和反对出版工作的计划化，反映了社会主义道路和资本主义道路两条道路的斗争。在这样严重的斗争中，必须坚定地保持原则立场，明辨大是大非，坚决反对右派对于社会主义思想阵地的冲击。
    计划化，这是社会主义制度不可缺少的一个环节。尽管计划化的程度和项目，可以因情况而异，但计划化的原则和基本制度必须坚持。但是有些同志因为阶级立场不坚定，或者政治觉悟不高，对于事情不善于运用阶级观点来分析，把计划化问题看作是一个技术问题，因而在这样重大的原则问题的斗争中动摇，对资产阶级作无原则的让步，甚至认为今后书籍的出版发行，可以不问内容和质量如何，一律不加控制，这种想法和作法是十分错误的。这说明，我们许多同志的身上还存在着资产阶级思想，因此，不能区别资产阶级的民主自由和无产阶级的民主自由，往往为右派分子的花言巧语所迷惑。经过这次反右派斗争使我们懂得，在原则问题上，资产阶级同无产阶级之间存在着根本的分歧。我们应该时刻保持警惕，才不致在大风大浪中迷失方向。
