　　Great Debate Brings New Atmosphere

　　Completing Eight-Tenths of the Task
　　Anhui Speeds Up Grain Procurement
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 10th - According to the grain department's statistics up to the 4th, Anhui Province has procured over 5.8 billion catties of grain. This figure accounts for approximately 84% of the annual grain procurement task.
　　Recently, Anhui Province has extensively and deeply carried out socialist ideological education in rural areas. The broad masses of farmers have correctly understood the relationship between the individual, the collective, and the state, greatly accelerating the progress of grain procurement. Since the start of autumn grain procurement, farmers across the province have been selling about 130 million catties of grain every day, with a peak of 160 million catties, the highest record ever achieved.

　　Mass Cotton Sales Form a Surge
　　Henan Purchases Nearly 100 Million Catties of Cotton
　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th - After the socialist great debate was launched in the cotton-producing areas of Henan Province, a mass upsurge of patriotic cotton sales emerged. As of the 5th, the province had purchased nearly 100 million catties of cotton (lint equivalent), more than double the amount purchased in the same period last year, accounting for more than one-third of the annual unified purchase task. Tanghe County, which has made faster progress in procurement, has purchased more than 80% of its annual task. Members of the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan, Lingbao County, originally thought that two catties of cotton per person was not enough. Cooperative cadres also wanted to keep good cotton and were unwilling to sell seed cotton. During the debate, members listed the fact that last year, each person kept three catties of cotton, some people wasted what they couldn't use, and some sold it at high prices in the free market, proving that two catties was enough. After the debate, members decided to sell good cotton and keep inferior cotton. Now, this cooperative has sold 1.5 million catties of dried and cleaned seed cotton in stock to the state. After debate, the socialist consciousness of the farmers in the First Agricultural Cooperative of Guangwu Township, Xingyang County, was raised, and they decided to adopt the method of "picking and drying as it is harvested, ginning when dried, and selling when ginned," selling more than 4,600 catties of lint every day.

　　Increased Supply, Stable Prices
　　Prosperous Scene in Laiyang, Shandong
　　Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 10th - After socialist ideological education in the rural areas of Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, a new scene of normalcy and prosperity has emerged in the market. The number of farmers abandoning agriculture for commerce has greatly decreased, unlicensed peddlers have disappeared, the supply of some materials, which was once artificially strained, is now easing, and prices are stable. The phenomenon of many agricultural cooperative members selling industrial products, hemp, waste rubber, and other materials in the market has now disappeared. In the free market, the amount of agricultural and sideline products such as live chickens, fresh eggs, vegetables, and fruits has begun to increase, and prices are stable. More and more farmers are selling unified purchased materials to the state. Last year, Laiyang Prefecture only purchased 80,000 catties of hemp, but by the end of September this year, it had purchased 150,000 catties.

　　Before and after the great debate, the entire prefecture completely closed the grain market. Within one month of the closure, the grain sold to the state by farmers alone reached more than 2,580,000 catties, 1,200,000 catties more than the month before the closure.

　　Now, this prefecture is taking measures to strengthen the leadership and management of the market. The entire region has established 89 market transaction management offices in major market towns, severely cracking down on speculative merchants and protecting the development of legitimate trade by farmers.

　　大辩论带来新气象
    完成任务十分之八
    安徽粮食征购进度加快
    新华社合肥10日电　安徽省征购的粮食已达五十八亿斤以上，这是粮食部门截至4日的统计。这一数字约占全年粮食征购任务的84％。
    安徽省最近一个时期在农村中广泛而深入地开展了社会主义思想教育，广大农民正确地认识了个人、集体和国家之间的关系，粮食征购进度大大加快。秋粮征购工作展开以来，全省农民每天交售的粮食有一亿三千万斤左右，最高时达到一亿六千万斤，这是历年来从未出现过的最高纪录。
    群众售棉形成热潮
    河南购棉已近亿斤
    新华社郑州10日电　河南省产棉区开展社会主义大辩论以后，出现了群众性的爱国售棉高潮。截至5日，全省已收购棉花折皮棉近一亿斤，比去年同期收购量增加了两倍多，占全年统购任务三分之一以上。收购工作进展较快的唐河县，收购到的棉花已占全年任务的80％以上。灵宝县城关红旗农业社的社员原来认为留棉二斤不够用，社干部也要留好花，不愿卖籽棉。在辩论时，社员们列举去年每人留三斤棉花，有些人用不完浪费了，有些人到自由市场上高价出售等事实，证明留二斤是够用的。经过辩论后，社员们决定卖好棉留次棉。现在，这个社已经把库存的一百五十万斤晒干拣净的籽棉卖给国家。荥阳县广武乡第一农业社经过辩论，农民的社会主义觉悟有了提高，决定采取“随收随晒、晒干就轧、轧好就卖”的办法，每天出售皮棉四千六百多斤。
    供应增加物价稳定
    山东莱阳景象繁荣
    据新华社莱阳10日电　山东省莱阳专区农村经过社会主义思想教育后，市场上呈现正常、繁荣的新景象。弃农经商的农民大大减少，无证商贩绝迹，有些物资的供应一度人为地造成紧张，现在又趋向缓和，物价稳定。过去集市上许多农业社员贩卖工业品、大麻、废橡皮等物资的现象现在没有了。在自由市场上，活鸡、鲜蛋、蔬菜、水果等农副产品的上市量开始增加，价格平稳。农民把统一收购的物资卖给国家的一天天多起来。去年莱阳专区只收购大麻八万斤，今年到9月底就收购了十五万斤。
    在大辩论前后，整个专区全面地封闭了粮食市场，在封闭的一个月内，仅农民零星卖给国家的粮食就达二百五十八万多斤，比未关闭前一个月多收购一百二十万斤。
    现在这个专区正采取措施，加强对市场的领导和管理。全区已在主要集镇设立市场交易管理所八十九处，狠狠地打击投机商贩，保护农民正当贸易的发展。
