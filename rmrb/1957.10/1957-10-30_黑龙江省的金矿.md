Gold Mines in Heilongjiang Province
By Our Correspondent Kang Weizhong

	From the banks of the roaring Heilongjiang and Songhua Rivers, to the "Forest Homeland" - the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Wanda Mountains; from the desolate, so-called "Great Northern Wilderness" of Luobei, to the flat, boundless, fertile Nenjiang Plain... Most counties in Heilongjiang Province have gold deposits.

	As early as the early years of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, the underground secret of gold was first revealed in Heihe, a place on the Heilongjiang bank in northern Heilongjiang Province. Soon, people discovered abundant gold resources in Mohe, Huma in the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River, Luobei in the lower reaches, and Huachuan and Yilan on the banks of the Songhua River. From those times on, the rulers recruited workers to mine gold everywhere. When the Japanese invaders occupied the Northeast, they frantically plundered our country's gold resources. Successive reactionary rulers recklessly mined gold resources without any planning. They often only mined rich ores and not poor ores, abandoning old mines when new mines were discovered. As a result, the gold resources of Heilongjiang Province suffered serious damage.

	From the day of liberation, gold mines belonged to the people; gold miners have since raised their heads and straightened their backs. The state develops large-scale mines on the one hand, and organizes and leads the scattered, small-scale gold mines on the other hand, and purchases gold at reasonable prices. According to the needs of the state, not long ago, the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry convened a provincial gold work conference to study the plan for developing gold production. The meeting decided to expand four gold mines including Handaqi, Wulaga, Huma and Luobei, and restore seven gold mines including Linkou, Muling, Huachuan, Tangyuan, Baoqing, Jixian, and Dongning. In May, the Ministry of Geology also sent a gold mine prospecting team to conduct a first-time survey of dozens of square kilometers of valleys in Xinglonggou, Beixili, Wolegen and other places in the Greater Khingan Mountains within the territory of Huma. In the area already explored, gold-bearing layers with high gold content and industrial value have been identified. In some places, gold sand layers were found about one meter underground, and the highest gold content in each cubic meter was as high as four grams.

	From the perspective of resources, Heilongjiang Province is almost "gold everywhere", but mining it is indeed a rather difficult task, like "finding a needle in a haystack." When you come to the gold mine, you can't see chimneys and factories, nor can you hear the deafening roar of machines. Here, all gold mining is done manually. According to the gold miners, gold is mined using two methods: "Qing" and "Waterway". "Qing" mining is like a coal mine's vertical shaft, dug very deep, with wooden boards as the roof below, supported by wooden pillars. Workers use baskets to scoop out gold sand, wash it with clean water, and pan out the gold. This method of gold mining is used in winter. "Waterway" gold mining involves digging a ditch on the ground, diverting water from nearby into the ditch, pouring gold-bearing sand, gravel and clay into the ditch, and using the impact of water to wash away the lighter sand and soil, leaving the heavier gold behind. This method of gold mining has a large output, high labor efficiency, and a high gold recovery rate. However, in winter, because the "waterway" freezes, this method cannot be used. In gold mines, "Qing" and "Waterway" are the production workshops of gold miners. In the past, the construction of "Qing" and "Waterway" was invested by the workers themselves; this year it was decided that the state would invest, and the investment would be recovered gradually after it was put into production.

	At present, there are two main forms of production organization for gold mines in Heilongjiang Province: handicraft production cooperatives and agricultural and sideline industries. Handicraft cooperatives are the main form of gold mine production at present. It is a voluntary association of members, collective production, all products are purchased by the state, and the profits are distributed by the members. Agricultural cooperatives organize some people to engage in gold production during slack farming seasons. This form of organization has a solid foundation in counties such as Huachuan and Muling. There, many farmers, including women and children, know how to mine gold. Organizing farmers to mine gold without delaying agricultural production can not only increase the state's gold purchases, but also increase the income of agricultural cooperatives. This method is worth promoting.

    黑龙江省的金矿
    本报记者　康伟中
    从滔滔奔流的黑龙江、松花江的两岸，到“森林故乡”——大小兴安岭和完达山脉；从荒草复盖、号称“北大荒”的萝北，到平坦无垠、千里沃野的嫩江平原……黑龙江省绝大多数县里，都有黄金矿藏。
    远在清朝同治初年，在黑龙江省北部黑龙江畔的黑河地方，地下的黄金秘密第一次被揭破了。不久，人们又在黑龙江的上游漠河、呼玛和下游的萝北，以及松花江畔的桦川、依兰等地，发现了丰富的金矿资源。从那些时候起，统治者就四处招雇工人来采金。日寇侵占东北的时候，对我国黄金资源进行了疯狂的掠夺。历来的反动统治者对金矿资源都是乱掘乱采，从无规划。他们往往是光采富矿，不采贫矿，发现新矿就丢掉旧矿。结果，黑龙江省的黄金资源遭受了严重的破坏。
    从解放那一天，金矿归人民所有；采金工人从此抬起了头，直起了腰。国家一面开发大型矿藏，一面对分散的、小型的金矿进行组织领导，并且用合理的价格收购黄金。根据国家的需要，不久以前，黑龙江省工业厅召开全省黄金工作会议，研究了发展黄金生产的规划。会议确定要扩建罕达气、乌拉嘎、呼玛、萝北等四个金矿，恢复林口、穆棱、桦川、汤原、宝清、集贤、东宁等七个金矿。5月间，地质部还派来金矿普查队，第一次在呼玛境内大兴安岭里的兴隆沟、北西利、倭勒根等地，对数十平方公里的沟谷进行了普查。在已经钻探的地区内，探明了含金率较高并且具有工业价值的含金层。有的地方钻入地下一公尺左右就发现了金砂层，在每一立方公尺的面积中，最高含金率有的高达四克。
    从资源看，黑龙江省几乎是“遍地黄金”，但是开采起来，“沙里淘金”的确是件颇不简单的事情。来到金矿，既看不到烟囱和厂房，也听不到震耳的机器轰鸣。这里，采金全用手工，按照采金工人的说法，是用“碃”和“水道”两种方法采金。“碃”采恰像煤矿的竖井，挖掘很深，下边用木板作顶棚，用木柱顶支着。工人用箩筐掏出沙金，经过净水冲洗，淘出金来。这种采金方法为在冬天应用。“水道”采金，是在地面上开挖一条沟渠，从附近引水入沟，把含金的沙石、粘土倒进沟内，利用水的冲击力量，把体重较轻的砂土冲走，使体重大的金子留下。这种采金方法，生产量大，劳动效率高，黄金收回率也高。但是一到冬天，因为“水道”结冰，这种办法就不能采用。在金矿，“碃”和“水道”就是采金工人的生产车间。过去，修建“碃”和“水道”都由工人自己投资；今年确定由国家投资，待投入生产后再逐年收回。
    目前，黑龙江省金矿的生产组织形式主要有两种：手工业生产合作社和农副业。手工业合作社是目前金矿生产的主要组织形式，它是社员自愿结合，集体生产，产品全部由国家收购，所得盈余，由社员分配。农业合作社在农闲时间，组织一部分人搞黄金生产，这种组织形式在桦川、穆棱等县很有基础。那里，许多农民，包括妇女、小孩都会采金。组织农民在不误农业生产的条件下采金，不仅可以增加国家黄金收购量，而且可以增加农业合作社的收入。这一办法值得提倡。
