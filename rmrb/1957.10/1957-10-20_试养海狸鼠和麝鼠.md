    Trial Breeding of Coypu and Muskrats

    Zhejiang Province is building two coypu and muskrat farms. The sites are located in Shengshan Township, Wuxing County, and by Dongqian Lake, Yin County, where grass fodder is abundant. One hundred muskrat breeding animals have been shipped from the Soviet Union. If the trial breeding is successful, it will be widely promoted in coastal and riverside areas.

    Coypu and muskrats are amphibious animals that mainly eat aquatic plants. Their fur is thick and highly resistant to cold. Their pelts are valuable raw materials for making fur coats. They are very prolific. One hundred breeding animals can produce more than 100,000 in two years.

    试养海狸鼠和麝鼠
    浙江省正在兴建两个海狸鼠和麝鼠的饲养场。场址在草料丰富的吴兴县升山乡和鄞县东钱湖畔。一百只麝鼠种畜已由苏联运来，试养成功后，将在沿海沿江一带大量推广。
    海狸鼠和麝鼠都是吃水草为主的水陆两栖动物，绒毛丰厚，御寒力强。它的皮毛是制裘用的珍贵原料。它们的繁殖力很强，一百只种畜饲养两年，可以繁殖十多万只。
