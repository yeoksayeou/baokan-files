Xinhua News Agency, 4th: An important measure taken by the Ministry of Chemical Industry in the process of rectification and reform is to abolish overlapping institutions, merge the ministry and bureau levels into a single level of leadership, and have the ministry directly lead enterprises. The implementation of this measure by the Ministry of Chemical Industry is of great significance for overcoming bureaucracy and red tape in the leading organs.

After the start of the rectification movement, cadres and workers of the ministry put forward more than 3,100 opinions on various aspects such as organizational structure, business operations, leadership style, and welfare, of which 272 concerned the system and organizational structure. The leadership of the Ministry of Chemical Industry carefully studied these opinions, adopted the reasonable parts, and conducted repeated discussions among the cadres. Finally, it was decided to abolish three administrative bureaus, three internal bureaus of the ministry, and three divisions, and to establish two new divisions and a research office, reducing the original 20 divisions and bureaus to 13.

As a result, the phenomenon of overlapping leadership institutions has been initially changed, allowing direct communication between the ministry and its subordinate enterprises, and a group of cadres has been drawn to strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level.

In order to strengthen leadership, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has also decided that individual vice ministers will concurrently serve as directors of divisions, all assistant ministers will concurrently serve as directors of divisions, and some deputy directors of divisions will concurrently serve as section chiefs.

According to the new establishment, the Ministry of Chemical Industry can transfer a total of 600 cadres to the grassroots level, including 18 at the division/bureau level and 22 at the section chief level.

This decision has been unanimously supported by the cadres. At present, the work of abolishing bureaus and merging divisions in the Ministry of Chemical Industry has been completed, and the first batch of 143 cadres being transferred are gradually taking up new posts.

In accordance with the spirit of rectification and reform, the leadership of the Ministry of Chemical Industry and its subordinate units has carefully sorted out the opinions put forward by cadres and workers. It was found that 60% of the opinions could be resolved conditionally and adopted and implemented immediately, and these have now been adopted and implemented. At present, the focus of the Ministry of Chemical Industry's rectification has gradually shifted to the aspect of work style.

    化工部边整边改中一项重要措施
    合并重叠机构下放大批干部
    据新华社4日讯　化学工业部在边整边改中采取了一项重要措施，这就是撤销重叠机构，合并部、局两级为一级领导，由部直接领导企业。化学工业部实行这一措施，对于克服领导机关的官僚主义和文牍主义有着很大的意义。
    整风运动开始后，这个部的干部和职工对组织机构、业务工作、领导作风、生活福利等各方面提出了三千一百多条意见，其中属于体制和组织机构方面的意见有二百七十二条。化学工业部领导方面认真研究了这些意见，采纳其中的合理部分，在干部中进行反复的讨论，最后决定撤销三个管理局、三个部内局和三个司，新成立两个司和一个调查研究室，由原来的二十个司局撤并为十三个司局。
    这样做的结果，初步改变了领导机构重叠的现象，使部和所属企业直接通气，并且抽出了一批干部加强基层领导力量。
    为了加强领导起见，化学工业部还决定个别副部长兼任司长，部长助理一律兼任司长，部分副司长兼任处长。
    根据新的编制，化学工业部共可抽调出六百名干部下放到基层，其中包括司、局长级干部十八人、处长级干部二十二人。
    这一决定，受到干部的一致拥护。目前，化学工业部撤局并司工作已经结束，第一批下放干部一百四十三人正在陆续走上新的工作岗位。
    根据边整边改的精神，化学工业部和所属各单位领导方面对干部和职工提出的各项意见都认真地进行了排队，其中60％的意见是有条件解决和能够马上采纳实行的，现在已经采纳实行了。目前，化学工业部整改的重点已经逐步转向工作作风方面。
