    To finalize the factory site, two responsible comrades from our construction unit and I, along with several comrades from relevant departments in Lanzhou, took a car to the proposed site on a clear morning.

    This area, initially selected as the factory site, was an orchard district. From a distance, it appeared as a dense green expanse, thickly covered with various fruit trees. Peach, apricot, and pear trees were planted in rows, interspersed irregularly. The pear and apricot trees had very lush foliage, appearing to be several decades old. At this time, it was the season for apricot ripening, and the yellow apricots hung heavily among the leaves. Although the peach trees were relatively short, they were also laden with unripe small peaches. The fields beneath the fruit trees were planted with melon vines—these were probably the nationally renowned "Bailan melons" and "Drunken melons"!

    Our group followed the positions marked on the blueprint, walking slowly along the road, inspecting the terrain and soil quality along the way. By noon, we had walked through the entire factory area. Finally, everyone sat down under a fruit tree to exchange opinions.

    Two engineers from the municipal urban planning unit, with whom we had interacted before, were present. However, another middle-aged man with them was someone I had never seen before. This man appeared to be in his forties and was of sturdy build. He was the first to speak, disagreeing with our plan to build the factory here, arguing that it was not good for the factory area to occupy almost half of the orchard. He hoped we would change the location to avoid the orchards. The two engineers with him echoed his opinion and insisted on it. Our leader also admitted that sacrificing many fruit trees to build the factory was regrettable. However, if the location were to be moved, a series of issues such as water and electricity supply, and transportation would have to be reconsidered and rearranged, and the survey work would have to be almost entirely redone, which would cause problems with both time and conditions. Therefore, he believed that "everything was ready," and sacrificing some fruit trees was a necessary sacrifice for the long-term plan. As a technician in the construction unit, although I had little experience in site selection, I intuitively felt that their insistence on moving the factory site was too arbitrary, so I argued on the basis of reason. I said that if we moved, the factory area would likely be located on macroporous soil, which would inevitably cause difficulties in civil construction and greatly increase the infrastructure investment. I also said that some of these fruit trees were in their "declining period" and their yield might not be high, and so on.

    The middle-aged man interrupted me, smiled, and said to me, "You are using arguments typical of Party A and Party B squabbling! We must consider the overall situation and also ask whether the farmers agree or not! This involves the issue of the worker-peasant alliance. Have you considered this? Look!" He pointed to the rows of small trees on the north hillside and said, "Those are the trees planted in the spring by comrades from enterprises, government agencies, and schools throughout the city in response to the call to green the Northwest. It will take many years and the labor of many people to grow them into fruit trees as thick as these! But you think it is perfectly justified to sweep away hundreds of acres of orchard…”

    His words initially sounded a bit like serious criticism, which was not pleasant to hear, but they blocked me from emphasizing my reasons further. Although he did not directly refute the technical reasons we had put forward, the views he raised were indeed something we had never considered. After discussing for a while, everyone decided to re-compare the various aspects carefully before finalizing the factory site.

    On the way back to the city, I asked a comrade sitting next to me who the middle-aged man was. He told me, "That is the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee."

    Three days later, I came to this factory site again with several Soviet experts. After walking less than a few hundred meters in the orchard, they unanimously opposed building the factory here. The translator told them the reasons why we did not advocate changing the location. One of the experts patted a large apricot tree and said, "In the Soviet Union, to remove such a tree, it is necessary to obtain the consent of the collective farm and the garden management department. Generally, unless there is a special reason, consent will absolutely not be granted. If we build a factory here, we will destroy hundreds of hectares of orchard, which is simply an act of destruction." Another expert continued, "Analyze the geological data more carefully, don't be afraid of trouble. Site selection is not a task that can be completed in one morning. You may find a more suitable place to build the factory. If the factory area can retain such a vast green area, it would be an unexpectedly ideal situation from the perspective of overall urban planning. How difficult it would be to cultivate such a green garden on flat ground!" He shrugged his shoulders as he spoke. "Besides, they also provide us with fruit to eat!"

    A few days later, we found a vacant area not far away that met all the requirements in all aspects, and the factory site was finally finalized there.

　　果园行

    为了最后确定厂区位置，在一个晴朗的早晨，我们建厂单位的两位负责同志和我，会同兰州市有关部门的几个同志，乘车到厂址所在地来。
    这个初步选做厂址的地带是果园区，远远望去，一片浓绿，茂密地长满各种果树。桃、杏、梨纵横成行参差相间，梨树和杏树枝叶非常丰盛，看上去已经有几十年的年龄了。此时，正是杏子成熟的季节，黄澄澄的杏子累累地结满枝叶间。桃树虽然比较低矮，但也满挂着未成熟的小桃子。果树下的田里，都栽植着瓜秧——这可能就是驰名全国的“白兰瓜”、“醉瓜”吧！
    我们一行人按照蓝图上标示的位置，沿着公路缓缓走过去，一路察看着地形和土质。到中午时分，我们已经走遍了整个厂区。最后大家在一棵果树下坐下来交换意见。
    市城市规划单位来了两位工程师，我们过去就曾打过交道，但同他们在一起的另外一个中年人却一次也没见过。这人看上去大约四十多岁，身材魁梧。他开腔便不同意我们在这里建厂，认为厂区几乎一半面积占用了果园是不好的，希望我们改变地址，避开果林。他们的两位工程师也附和着他的意见，并坚持着。我们的负责人也承认为了建立工厂牺牲很多果树是个遗憾，但是如果迁移地址的话，供水、供电和交通运输等一系列的问题都要重新考虑和安排，勘选工作几乎全部重做，时间和条件将会都成问题。所以认为是“万事皆备”，只是牺牲一些果树，为了百年大计也只好如此了。我，作为建厂单位一个技术人员，虽然选厂经验很少，但直觉上认为他们坚持迁移厂址太武断，就据理力争。我说如果搬动的话，很可能使厂区座落在大孔性土壤上，势必会造成土建施工的困难，使基建投资大为增加。又说这些果树中，有的已到“衰老期”，产量不见得高等等。
    那位中年人打断我的话，笑着对我说：“你这是甲乙方扯皮的说法！要从整体来考虑，也要问问农民同意不同意呀！这是涉及工农联盟的问题，你们考虑过没有？你看！”他用手指指北山坡上一排排的小树说：“那是春天我们全市企业、机关、学校的同志们在绿化西北的号召下种的树，要历经多少岁月，付出多少人的劳动；才能长成像这样粗大的果树呵！而你们却以为横扫果园几百亩像满有理由似的。……”
    他的话初听起来，有点严肃批评的味道，心里不大受用，但却把我再要强调的理由挡回去了。他虽然没有正面驳倒我们提出的技术上的道理，然而他谈到的看法我们的确从未想到过。又讨论了一会儿，大家决定从各方面重新慎重比较后，再来确定厂区位置。
    乘车回城的路上，我问坐在旁边的一位同志，刚才那位中年人是谁，他告诉我：“这是市委书记。”
    三天以后，我又跟几位苏联专家来到这个厂址。在果林内走了不及几百公尺，他们便一致反对在这里建厂，翻译同志把我们不主张改变地址的原因告诉了他们，其中一个专家拍了拍一棵大杏树说：“在苏联，要拔除这样一株树，必须经过集体农庄和园林管理部门的同意，一般不是有特殊理由，绝对不会获得同意的。如果在这里建厂，就要把上百公顷的果林摧毁，这简直是一种破坏。”另一位专家接上去说：“再仔细分析一下地质资料，不要怕费事，选厂不是一个早上就能完成的任务，可能会找到更适合建厂的地方。工厂区间能保留这样广阔的绿化地带，从城市整体规划讲，是意外理想的，如果平地上培育这么一块绿化园林该是多么不容易的事！”他说着耸了耸肩。“何况，还供应我们水果吃呢！”
    几天后我们就在相去不远的地方，找到了各方面条件都能令人满意的空旷地带，厂区最后在那里肯定下来了。
