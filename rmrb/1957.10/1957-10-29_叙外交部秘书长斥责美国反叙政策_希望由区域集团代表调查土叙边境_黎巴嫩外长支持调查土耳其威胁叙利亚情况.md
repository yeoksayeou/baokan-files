Xinhua News Agency, October 28th, Damascus News: Syrian Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Tarazi stated on the 27th that Syria hopes a representative committee will investigate the tense situation on the Turkish-Syrian border.

Speaking to a United Press International reporter, he said that while Syria does not object to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld serving as the investigation representative, if the United Nations decides to conduct an investigation, Syria would prefer a delegation composed of regional groups to conduct the investigation.

Tarazi condemned the United States' policy towards the Middle East, pointing out that this policy is anti-Syrian. He said that the current Turkish threat to Syria began after U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson's activities in the Middle East.

Tarazi praised the Soviet Union's Middle East policy as being in line with the interests of Arab countries. He explained that Arab countries are willing to accept unconditional economic aid from anyone.

When asked by a United Press International reporter about the NATO exercises to be held in southern Turkey, Tarazi said that holding such exercises might be an excuse for Turkish troops to gather on the Syrian border.

Xinhua News Agency, October 28th, New York News: Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik stated on the 27th in a conversation with American reporters that if Syria is invaded, Lebanon will definitely stand by Syria.

He said that he hopes for peace. But if Syria is attacked, Arab countries have no choice but to defend Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Malik supported the Syrian representative's proposal at the United Nations to send a commission of inquiry to investigate Turkey's threats to Syria. He said that if the United Nations General Assembly votes on this proposal, he will definitely vote in favor of it. Malik also criticized Israel and advocated that the United Nations broadly study the entire Palestinian issue.

    希望由区域集团代表调查土叙边境
    黎巴嫩外长支持调查土耳其威胁叙利亚情况
    新华社28日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部秘书长塔拉齐27日表示，叙利亚希望一个具有代表性的委员会去调查土耳其—叙利亚边境的紧张局势。
    他在同合众社记者谈话时说，固然叙利亚并不反对联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德这样一个人担任调查代表，但是，如果联合国决定进行调查的话，叙利亚是更加希望由区域集团组成的代表团来进行调查的。
    塔拉齐谴责美国对中东的政策，指出这种政策是反叙利亚的。他说，目前土耳其对叙利亚的威胁是在美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊到中东活动以后开始的。
    塔拉齐赞扬苏联的中东政策是符合阿拉伯国家的利益的。他说明，阿拉伯国家愿意接受任何人的无条件的经济援助。
    合众社记者问起北大西洋公约组织将在土耳其南部举行演习的事，塔拉齐说，举行这种演习可能是为土耳其军队集结在叙利亚边境找借口。
    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：黎巴嫩外交部长马利克27日在对美国记者发表谈话时说，如果叙利亚遭到侵略，黎巴嫩肯定是要站在叙利亚一边的。
    他说，他是希望和平的。但是如果叙利亚遭到攻击，阿拉伯国家除了去维护叙利亚的主权和领土完整以外是别无其他选择的。
    马利克支持叙利亚代表在联合国提出的关于派一个调查委员会去调查土耳其对叙利亚的威胁的建议，他说，如果联合国大会就这个建议进行表决，他肯定将要投票支持它。马利克还对以色列进行抨击，他主张联合国广泛地研究整个巴勒斯坦问题。
