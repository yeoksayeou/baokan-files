Title: On "Feeling Unappreciated"

Some people, it is said, because they "feel unappreciated" (怀才不遇), become alienated from the Party, dissatisfied, and ultimately, turn reactionary. In this anti-Rightist struggle, such examples are common.

Among intellectuals, there are quite a few people who feel frustrated and unable to realize their ambitions, although not all of them are reactionary or rightists.

Whether these "talented individuals" who "feel unappreciated" are truly talented; whether "talent" can be separated from "virtue" in our society and viewed in isolation, etc., are all questions that remain to be answered, so let's set them aside for now. What I want to say is that these talented individuals who harbor this kind of thinking should at least consider the following two points:

First, since they "feel unappreciated," they hope that their talent will find a good buyer, so that it can be "sold at a good price" (善价而沽). If a good price can be offered, then it counts as "encountering" (遇) the right person, regardless of whether this buyer is Li Si or Wang Wu, whether he has a red nose or blue eyes, whether he wants to use their "talent" as a slave or as a dog. If the price is high enough, they can even "die for a confidant" (士为知己者死), sacrificing their heads to repay the master who appreciates them, which is truly tragic. All exploiting classes naturally need this kind of "talent," and naturally they can "sell at a good price," because they need a group of slaves who can guard the door and manage the household for them. So, at that time, "encountering talent" (怀才而遇) was very natural. Now it is different. There are no more exploiting classes. For the proletariat, this kind of "talent" is of little use, but overall, if it is not thoroughly reformed, it will do more harm than good. Therefore, feeling unappreciated is also very natural.

Second, having this kind of thinking means at least that, emotionally, they are alienating themselves from the people. You are not standing among the six hundred million as a member of the masters, feeling that this socialist country is your own, and that you should let yourself and the masses temper and forge this "talent" in the furnace of the masses, so that it can shine and radiate for the construction of your motherland; instead, you are standing outside the six hundred million, pouting, with a belly full of anger, feeling that if you don't come to unite me, I won't get close to you; if you don't "appreciate" me, I won't buy your story; the boundary between "you" and "me" is clear, the barriers are solid, isn't this alienation?

"A thousand-mile horse is common, but a Bole (伯乐, someone who recognizes talent) is not." I heard a friend who "felt unappreciated" appreciate this sentence. Some gentlemen probably feel the same way. But they are appreciating it wrong. Today's Boles are not rare, but there are too many of them, all the working people. It's just that their criteria for choosing a thousand-mile horse are not only that it must be strong and agile, able to travel a thousand miles a day; but also that it must honestly let the working people ride it, and a horse that cannot be ridden, even if it runs fast, is still useless. My analogy may be a bit crude, or a bit inappropriate, but please forgive me. Didn't Lu Xun say "Bow my head, I am willing to be an ox for the children" (俯首甘为孺子牛)?

    说“怀才不遇”
    季槐
    有些人，据说因为“怀才不遇”，对于党，因而疏远，因而不满，最后，因而反动起来了。在这次反右派斗争中，这样的事例已屡见不鲜。
    在知识分子中，像这样郁郁不得志的人，还不算太少，虽然他们并不都反动，并不都是右派。
    “怀才不遇”的“才子”，是否实有才；在我们社会里，“才”是否能和“德”割裂开来，孤立地去看它，等等，都还是打了疑问号的，这里且存而不论。我要说的是，抱有这种思想的才子，至少有下列两点，值得考究考究：
    其一，既然是怀才不遇，那就是希望他的才，遇到一个好买主，从而“善价而沽”。能出好价钱，那就算“遇”上了，不管这买主是李四还是王五，是红鼻子还是蓝眼睛，是要用他的“才”去做奴才呢，还是做狗才，都不在话下；价钱出得再高一些，还可以“士为知己者死”，为了报答赏识自己的主子而献出脑袋，真是悲壮得很。这样的“才”，一切剥削阶级自然是需要的，自然他们也能“善价而沽”，因为他们要有这么一批能为他们看门管家的奴才。于是，那时候，“怀才而遇”也就是很自然的了。现在不同了，再没有剥削阶级了，对于无产阶级，这样的“才”，虽然也略有小用处，但总的说来，如果不脱胎换骨地改造一番，却是害大利小；因此，怀才而不遇，同样又是很自然的了。
    其二，有这种思想，至少在感情上是自外于人民。你不是作为主人翁中的一员，站在六亿的队伍之中，感到这社会主义国家是自己的，应该让自己和群众一道，把这“才”在群众的熔炉里锻炼、陶冶，使它能够为建设自己的祖国放光芒、射异彩；而是站在这六亿的队伍之外，撅着嘴巴，憋着一肚子气，觉得你不来团结我，我就不靠拢你；你不“赏识”我，我就不买你的账；“你”“我”之间，界限分明，壁垒森严，这不是自外是什么呢？
    “千里马常有，而伯乐不常有”。我就听到一个“怀才不遇”的朋友欣赏过这句话。有些先生当也有同感。但他们是欣赏错了。今天的伯乐不是不常有，而是太多太多了，全体劳动人民就都是。只是，他们选择千里马的标准，不但要雄壮、矫健，能日行千里；而且还要它能老老实实让劳动人民骑着走，不能骑的马，纵然跑得也快，也还是不顶事的。我这样打比方，或者太粗鲁了些，或者有点不伦不类，但这都请先生们海涵。鲁迅先生不是说过“俯首甘为孺子牛”么。
