Xinhua News Agency, 29th - A total of seven of the forty-six industrial products included in the Five-Year Plan have completed the plan ahead of schedule according to calculations from the State Statistical Bureau as of the end of August. The cumulative output of these seven products for twelve months reached the level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for 1957. These seven products are: electricity, raw coal, coke, trucks, rubber shoes, flour, and plate glass.

Including the twenty-seven products that were completed ahead of schedule last year, a total of thirty-four industrial products have already completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The twenty-seven products that were completed ahead of schedule last year are: pig iron, steel, steel products, caustic soda, soda ash, ammonium nitrate, penicillin, chloramphenicol, various sulfonamides, automobile tires, steam boilers, steam turbines, water turbines, internal combustion engines, generators, electric motors, transformers, metal cutting machine tools, double-wheeled double-share plows, grain sowing machines, passenger cars, bicycles, machine-made paper, cement, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and burlap sacks.

Due to the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, China's industrial production level has taken a great leap forward. The ranking of major products in the world has significantly improved. For example, comparing 1936 with 1956, China's steel output has risen from 18th to 12th place in the world, iron has risen from 12th to 8th place, and coal has risen from 7th to 5th place.

By the end of this year, China's steel production will reach 5 million tons, and coal production will reach 120 million tons. Cumulatively over five years, steel will amount to approximately 16 million tons, and coal will amount to approximately 460 million tons. From the time Li Hongzhang founded the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau in 1900 and began producing steel, to 49 years later in 1948, China's total steel production was only 7.6 million tons. From the construction of China's first coal mine in Keelung, Taiwan in 1876, to 72 years later in 1948, China's total coal production was only 1.1 billion tons. These figures show that in New China, the steel production in one Five-Year Plan can exceed that of old China in 49 years by more than double, and coal production can reach more than 42% of that of old China in 72 years. It is also worth noting that a large portion of the aforementioned 7.6 million tons and 1.1 billion tons were produced by enterprises operated by Japanese imperialists and other imperialists in China. In old China, the textile industry was considered a relatively developed sector. However, according to currently available data, a total of over 30.28 million pieces of cotton yarn were produced in the 18 years from 1919 to 1936. In contrast, over 22.55 million pieces of cotton yarn were produced during the Five-Year Plan period in New China. Five years equals 74.5% of the eighteen years of old China.

Five million tons of steel is still a small figure compared to the advanced industrial nations of the world, but it is very considerable compared to the past and present economic situation of our country. Five million tons of steel can now meet 88% of the needs of China's national economy. In 1952, China's steel production could only meet 61% of the needs, and at that time, China's construction scale and industrial production scale were much smaller than they are now.

Not only compared to old China, but also compared to the major capitalist countries in the world, the speed of industrial development in our country is astonishing. Taking steel production, which is representative of industrial level, as an example, China's steel production increased from 1.35 million tons to nearly 5 million tons in five years. In the industrial development history of the major capitalist countries in the world, it took much longer to increase steel production from around 1.35 million tons to around 5 million tons. France took 25 years for this journey, Britain took 23 years, Germany took 13 years, the United States took 12 years, and even the fastest, Japan, took 11 years.

With the improvement of industrial technology and the strengthening of the sense of socialist ownership among the vast number of workers and staff, the consumption of raw materials for China's industrial products has been greatly reduced during the Five-Year Plan. For example, to spin one piece of cotton yarn, calculated using the "general draw" method, 198.83 kilograms of cotton were required in 1952, while only 193.31 kilograms were required in the first half of 1957, a reduction of 2.78%. To manufacture one ton of paper within the light industry system, 1068.89 kilograms of pulp were required in 1952, while only 1007.9 kilograms were required in 1957, a reduction of 6.71%. To extract one ton of soybean oil, 8591 kilograms of soybeans were required in 1952, while only 7457 kilograms were required in 1956, a reduction of 13.2%. To generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity within the power industry system, 0.659 kilograms of coal were required in 1952, while only 0.567 kilograms were required in 1956, a reduction of 14%.

With the reduction of raw material consumption and the improvement of business operations, the cost of industrial products has also been continuously reduced. The original plan of the twelve central industrial ministries (excluding the Ministry of Forestry) was to cumulatively reduce costs by 22% in five years, but by the first half of 1957, costs had already been reduced by 27.8%, exceeding the plan by 5.8%.

    工业生产大跃进
    四十六种主要产品中有三十四种提前完成五年计划
    新华社29日讯  列入五年计划的四十六种工业产品，根据国家统计局计算，截至8月底止，又有七种提前完成五年计划。这七种产品累计十二个月的产量都达到了五年计划所规定的1957年的水平。这七种产品是：电、原煤、焦炭、载重汽车、胶鞋、面粉、平板玻璃。
    连去年就提前完成的二十七种产品，一共已经有三十四种工业产品提前完成了五年计划。去年就提前完成五年计划的二十七种产品是：生铁、钢、钢材、烧碱、纯碱、硝酸铵、青霉素、氯霉素、各种磺胺、汽车外胎、蒸汽锅炉、汽轮机、水轮机、内燃机、发电机、电动机、变压器、金属切削机床、双轮双铧犁、谷类播种机、客车、自行车、机制纸、水泥、棉纱、棉布、麻袋。
    由于五年计划的实施，我国工业生产水平已大大跃进一步。主要产品在世界行列中的次位已有显著提高。如以1936年和1956年对比来看，我国钢产量已从占世界第十八位提高到占第十二位，铁已从占世界第十二位提高到占第八位，煤已从占世界第七位提高到占第五位。
    到今年年底，我国钢的产量可达五百万吨，煤的产量可达一点二亿吨。五年累计，钢约一千六百万吨，煤约四点六亿吨。从1900年李鸿章创办的江南制造局开始出钢起，到1948年的四十九年间，我国生产的钢，累计不过七百六十万吨。从1876年台湾基隆兴建中国第一座煤矿起，到1948年的七十二年间，我国生产的煤，累计不过十一亿吨。这些数字表明：在新中国，一个五年计划，钢产量就可以超过旧中国四十九年的一倍以上，煤产量就达到旧中国七十二年的42％以上。还值得注意的是，上述七百六十万吨和十一亿吨里面有很大一部分是日本帝国主义者和其他帝国主义者在我国经营的企业所生产出来的。在旧中国，纺织工业算是比较发展的部门。但根据目前手头搜集到的资料来看，从1919年到1936年的十八年间，共生产棉纱三千零二十八万余件。而在新中国的五年计划期间就生产了棉纱二千二百五十五万余件。五年等于旧中国十八年的74.5％。
    五百万吨钢和世界上先进的工业国家相比，还是很小的数字，但是跟过去和目前我国的经济情况相比，它就是很可观的。五百万吨钢目前已可以满足我国国民经济需要的88％，在1952年，我国生产的钢还只能满足61％的需要，而那时我国的建设规模和工业生产规模都比现在要小得多。
    不只和旧中国比，就是和世界上主要资本主义国家比，我国工业发展的速度也是惊人的。拿对工业水平具有代表性的钢产量来说，经过五年，我国钢产量就从一百三十五万吨提高到近五百万吨。而在世界上主要资本主义国家的工业发展史上，要把一百三十五万吨左右的钢产量提高到五百万吨左右的钢产量，却经历了更长得多的岁月。这一段途程，法国走了二十五年，英国走了二十三年，德国走了十三年，美国走了十二年，最快的要算日本也走了十一年。
    随着工业技术水平的提高和广大职工社会主义主人翁思想的加强，在五年计划中，我国工业产品的原材料消耗量都降低了很多。如纺一件棉纱，以“通扯”计算，1952年要用棉花一九八点八三公斤，而1957年上半年则只用一九三点三一公斤，降低了2.78％。轻工业部系统造一吨纸，1952年要用一零六八点八九公斤纸浆，而1957年则只用一零零七点九公斤，降低了6.71％。榨一吨豆油，1952年要用大豆八千五百九十一公斤，而1956年则只用七千四百五十七公斤，降低了13.2％。电力工业部系统发一度电，1952年要用煤零点六五九公斤，而1956年则只用零点五六七公斤，降低了14％。
    随着原材料消耗量的降低和企业经营的改善，工业产品成本也在不断降低。中央十二个工业部（不包括森林工业部）原计划在五年内累计降低成本22％，但是到1957年上半年，就已经降低了27.8％，超过计划5.8％。
