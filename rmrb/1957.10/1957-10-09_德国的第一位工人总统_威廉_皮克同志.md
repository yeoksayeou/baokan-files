    Germany's First Worker President
    Comrade Wilhelm Pieck
    Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, whose term as President was extended for another four years by the joint session of the People's Chamber and Senate of the German Democratic Republic on October 7th, is Germany's first worker president, a leader beloved by the German working class and all the people, and an outstanding activist in the world's worker movement. He was born on January 3, 1876, and is now eighty-one years old. He joined the German worker movement at the age of eighteen. His life is inseparable from the glorious struggle path of the German working class and its vanguard party.
    Comrade Pieck joined the German Social Democratic Party in 1895. In 1910, he served as the second secretary of the party's central education committee. Comrade Pieck stood firmly with the true warriors of the German working class and the leaders of the Social Democratic left wing, such as Luxemburg and Liebknecht, constantly fighting against the opportunists who controlled the leadership. During the First World War, amidst the tide of German militarism and the national chauvinism of the Social Democratic Party leaders, the Social Democratic left entrusted Comrade Pieck with publishing the "International" magazine in 1914, calling for an end to the imperialist war. In May 1915, he was entrusted again to organize the first peace demonstration of the German people. Comrade Pieck was arrested and imprisoned during the march. Later, he was sent to the front lines. In 1918, Comrade Pieck resided in the Netherlands and participated in the work of the "Struggle" society, a magazine for German political exiles. He published articles calling on German workers to learn from the example of Russian workers and rise up to establish a revolutionary regime. Comrade Pieck actively participated in the struggle to overthrow the government of Emperor Wilhelm of Germany.
    At the end of 1918, the left wing of the German Social Democratic Party established the German Communist Party. Comrade Pieck was one of the founders of the German Communist Party and has been in a leadership position since the party's establishment. The party leaders Luxemburg and Liebknecht were murdered by reactionary forces shortly after the party's establishment. Comrade Pieck, along with Comrade Thalmann, tirelessly carried out arduous struggles for the consolidation and development of the party. Comrade Pieck served as a member of the Reichstag and the Greater Berlin Assembly in the years before Hitler came to power. He expanded the revolutionary influence through his activities in parliament and among the working masses. After the fascists came to power, Comrade Thalmann was arrested and brutally murdered. In 1935, at the party's congress in Brussels, Comrade Pieck was elected to succeed him as chairman of the party.
    In 1931, Comrade Pieck served as a member of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and Secretary of the Secretariat. During the dark days of Hitler's rise to power in Germany, Comrade Pieck, together with the German Communist Party leadership and international comrades, planned and carried out the path of struggle to eliminate fascism. During World War II, he actively participated in the work of the "Free Germany National Committee."
    After the heroic Soviet army completely crushed Hitler's fascism, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, headed by Comrade Pieck, put forward a clear program for saving the nation and rebuilding Germany in June 1945. In 1946, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in eastern Germany merged to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and Comrade Pieck served as one of the two chairmen of the party. After the establishment of the German Democratic Republic in October 1949, Comrade Pieck has served as its president. The German people love this first worker president in German history and respect his glorious labor in leading the people in the struggle to defend peace, strive for German unification, and consolidate the socialist system. He is therefore known by the people as the Father of German Unification. (Xinhua News Agency)

    德国的第一位工人总统
    威廉·皮克同志
    10月7日由德意志民主共和国人民议院和参议院联席会议决定延长总统任期四年的威廉·皮克同志，是德国第一位工人总统，是德国工人阶级和全体人民所爱戴的领袖，是世界工人运动的杰出活动家。他诞生于1876年1月3日，今年已是八十一岁的高龄。他十八岁起参加了德国工人运动。他的一生是和德国工人阶级及其先锋政党的光荣斗争道路分不开的。
    皮克同志在1895年参加了德国社会民主党。1910年他担任党中央教育委员会的第二书记。皮克同志在党内和德国工人阶级的真正战士、社会民主党左翼领袖卢森堡、李卜克内西等坚决站在一起，向把持了领导机构的机会主义者不断进行斗争。第一次世界大战期间，在德国军国主义和社会民主党领袖的民族沙文主义的逆流里，社会民主党左派委托皮克同志在1914年出版了“国际”杂志，号召停止帝国主义战争。1915年5月，又委托他组织了德国人民第一次和平示威。在游行中，皮克同志被捕入狱。以后他被送往前线。1918年皮克同志侨居荷兰，参加德国政治流亡者机关杂志“斗争”社的工作。他发表文章号召德国工人学习俄国工人的榜样，起来建立革命政权。皮克同志积极参加了推翻德皇威廉政府的斗争。
    1918年底，德国社会民主党中的左派成立了德国共产党。皮克同志是德国共产党的创始人之一，并从党的成立起就担任了领导工作。党的领袖卢森堡和李卜克内西在党成立后不久，被反动势力杀害了。皮克同志和台尔曼同志一道，不倦地为党的巩固和发展，进行艰巨的斗争。皮克同志曾经在希特勒上台以前的几年中，担任国会议员和大柏林议会议员，他通过议会和在工人群众中的活动，扩大革命的影响。法西斯上台后，台尔曼同志被捕并惨遭谋害。1935年党在布鲁塞尔举行代表大会，皮克同志当选继任党的主席。
    皮克同志在1931年担任了共产国际执行委员会主席团委员和书记处书记。在希特勒上台的德国黑暗日子里，皮克同志和德共领导机构以及国际战友们，规划和进行消灭法西斯的斗争道路。在第二次大战中，他积极参加了“自由德国民族委员会”的工作。
    英勇的苏联军队把希特勒法西斯主义彻底粉碎后，以皮克同志为首的德共中央委员会，在1945年6月，提出了拯救民族和重建德国的明确纲领。1946年，德国东部的共产党和社会民主党合并组成德国统一社会党，皮克同志担任了党的两位主席之一。1949年10月，德意志民主共和国成立后，皮克同志一直担任总统。德国人民热爱德国历史上的这第一位工人总统，尊敬他领导人民进行保卫和平、争取德国统一、巩固社会主义制度的斗争中的光辉劳动。他因此被人民称为德国统一之父。（新华社）
