    People Save Food, Horses Save Feed
    LIZHI Cooperative to Save 140,000 Jin of Grain During Autumn Harvest
    (Our report) The LIZHI Agricultural Production Cooperative branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Lanleng Township, Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, combined the socialist debate in the countryside with ideological education on saving grain for its members. Now, a new atmosphere of cherishing grain has been initially established throughout the cooperative.
    Fu Chengzhi, the old feeder of the First Production Team, proposed not leaving any grain at the bottom of the trough when feeding horses, and not scattering feed when adding it. The thirty-two horses he was responsible for saved six jin and four liang of grain per day without affecting their condition. Li Shufang, the cook of the Second Team, proposed calculating the amount of rice before cooking, not leaving leftovers or undercooking, and making more vegetables, ensuring that each person saves one liang of grain per day. Cooperative member Tong Zhongxin also made two suggestions to all members: first, do not use grain to exchange for fish or snacks; second, do not use grain (yellow millet, bean buns) as gifts. Each production team also proposed specific measures for saving grain during the autumn harvest. According to the current plans proposed by each team and household, the cooperative can save a total of 145,840 jin of grain during the autumn harvest.

    人省口粮  马省饲料
    立志社秋收中将节约粮食十四万斤
    本报讯  在秋收中，中共黑龙江省双城县兰棱乡立志农业生产合作社支部，结合农村社会主义大辩论，向社员进行了节约粮食的思想教育，现在全社已初步树立起人人爱惜粮食的新风气。
    第一生产队饲养员傅成志老大爷提出喂马时不剩槽底、添料不拉拉，他负责饲养的三十二匹马在不影响马膘情况下，每天节约六斤四两粮食。二队炊事员李树芳提出做饭计算好再下米，不剩饭、不夹生，多做菜，每天每人保证节约一两粮食。社员佟忠信还向全体社员提出两条建议：第一，不用粮食换鱼和换零嘴吃；第二，不拿粮食（黄米、豆包）送礼。各生产队也都提了秋收节约粮食的具体措施。根据现在各队各户提出的计划，秋收中全社共可节约十四万五千八百四十斤粮食。
