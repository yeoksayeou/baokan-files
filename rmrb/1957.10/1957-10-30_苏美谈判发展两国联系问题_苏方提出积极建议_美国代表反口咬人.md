Xinhua News Agency, Washington, October 29th: According to previous agreements, the Soviet Union and the United States began talks in Washington on October 28 regarding the development of contacts and relations between the two countries.

	During the talks, the Soviet delegation presented a specific plan for Soviet-U.S. cultural cooperation in 1958-1959. This plan stipulates that the two countries will send delegations of experts in industry, agriculture, education, and health to each other. The Soviet Union suggested that scientists from both countries establish close ties and exchange opinions, send delegations of legislative bodies to each other, arrange visits by artistic representatives of both countries, and organize exchanges of film and radio/television music programs. The Soviet Union also suggested that trade personnel and newspaper representatives from both countries visit each other, and that direct air routes be opened between the two countries.

	Speaking at the meeting, the head of the Soviet delegation, Zarubin, said: Expanding contacts and relations between the two countries will improve Soviet-U.S. relations and ease international tensions, which is a goal the Soviet government has been striving to achieve in the past and present.

	The head of the U.S. delegation, Lacy, said at the meeting that the U.S. government believes that the current negotiations are of great significance. However, in his speech, apart from proposing the exchange of radio and television programs, he did not put forward any other specific suggestions. At the same time, he insisted that the Soviet Union was obstructing the arrangement of contacts and relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.

	In his reply, Zarubin refuted the U.S. representative's accusation that the Soviet Union was obstructing exchanges and contacts. Zarubin stated that the Soviet delegation was prepared to study the U.S. suggestions in detail.

	The next round of negotiations will be held on November 4th.

    苏美谈判发展两国联系问题
    苏方提出积极建议　美国代表反口咬人
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿29日讯：苏美两国根据以往的协议，在10月28日开始在华盛顿举行关于发展两国之间的接触和联系问题的谈判。
    苏联代表团在谈判中提出了苏联和美国1958—1959年文化合作的具体计划。这个计划规定两国互派工业、农业、教育和卫生各方面的专家代表团。苏联建议两国科学家建立密切的联系和交换意见，互派立法机构的代表团，安排两国艺术代表的访问以及组织影片和广播电视音乐节目的交换。苏联还建议两国贸易工作人员和报刊代表互相访问，两国之间开辟直达空运航线。
    苏联代表团团长查鲁宾在会上发言时说：扩大两国之间的联系和接触将会改善苏美的关系和缓和国际紧张局势，而这是苏联政府过去和现在一直在努力实现的目标。
    美国代表团团长拉西在会上说，美国政府认为目前的谈判具有重大的意义。但是，他在发言中除了提出交换广播和电视节目的建议以外，并没有提出其他任何具体的建议。同时，他硬说苏联在阻挠安排苏美两国之间的接触和联系。
    查鲁宾在答复中驳斥了美国代表诬蔑苏联阻挠交流和接触的说法。查鲁宾表示苏联代表团准备详细研究美国的建议。
    下次谈判将在11月4日举行。
