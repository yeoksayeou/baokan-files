    Xi'an Third Power Plant
    The newly built Xi'an Third Power Plant is equipped with the most advanced Soviet technology and the latest machinery. After the entire power plant is completed, its power generation will be about twice that of the Xi'an Second Power Plant. It will not only supply electricity to factories in the Xi'an area, but also to areas such as Xianyang, Tongchuan, Xingping, and Baoji. (Wang Hanjie, Lu Min)

    西安第三发电厂
    新建西安第三发电厂是用苏联最先进的技术和最新式的机器装备起来的。这个电厂全部完工以后，发电量要比西安第二发电厂约大一倍。它不但要供应西安地区工厂用电，还要供咸阳、铜川、兴平、宝鸡等地的用电。　（王汉杰、卢敏）
