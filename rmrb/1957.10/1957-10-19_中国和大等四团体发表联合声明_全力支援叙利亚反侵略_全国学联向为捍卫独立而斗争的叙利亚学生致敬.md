Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The China Peace Committee, the Islamic Association of China, the China-Syria Friendship Association, and the China-Egypt Friendship Association issued a joint statement today, angrily condemning and resolutely opposing the U.S. imperialist plot to instigate Turkey to launch a war of aggression against Syria. They also stated that they would fully support the just struggle of the heroic Syrian people and Arab people to resist the aggressors.
    The full text of the joint statement is as follows:
    After the failure of a series of subversive activities against Syria, U.S. imperialism, disregarding the condemnation and warnings of Syria, Egypt, other Arab countries, the Soviet Union, and the people of countries around the world, is now making every effort to instigate Turkey to launch a war of aggression against Syria. Turkey has already amassed a large number of troops on the Syrian-Turkish border, and the U.S. Sixth Fleet has also been deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean. The crisis of a war of aggression is seriously threatening the independence and security of Syria and Middle Eastern countries, and seriously threatening world peace and security.
    We, the Chinese people who oppose aggression and defend peace, angrily condemn and resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist plot to instigate Turkey to launch a war of aggression against Syria! We fully sympathize with and support the just cause of the Syrian government and people to defend national independence, defend peace, and resist aggression. All of us Chinese people will, together with peace-loving people all over the world, fully support the heroic Syrian people and Arab people's just struggle to resist the aggressors.
    The Chinese people solemnly warn the U.S. aggressors: If you want to launch a war, you will definitely not end well. Those who play with fire will burn themselves. If Turkey continues to act as a tool of aggression for U.S. imperialism, it will also reap the bitter fruit.
    We call on all people who love peace and uphold justice to unite more closely and, with the greatest effort and effective action, stop and crush the U.S. plot to instigate Turkey to invade Syria, and resolutely defend peace in the Middle East and the world!

　　中国和大等四团体发表联合声明
    全力支援叙利亚反侵略
    全国学联向为捍卫独立而斗争的叙利亚学生致敬
    新华社18日讯  中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国伊斯兰教协会、中叙友好协会、中埃友好协会今天发表联合声明，愤怒谴责和坚决反对美帝国主义驱使土耳其阴谋发动侵略叙利亚战争的罪恶行为，并且表示将全力支援英勇的叙利亚人民和阿拉伯人民抵抗侵略者的正义斗争。
    联合声明的全文如下：
    美帝国主义在对叙利亚进行一系列颠覆活动的阴谋失败后，不顾叙利亚、埃及等阿拉伯国家以及苏联和全世界各国人民的谴责和警告，目前正竭力驱使土耳其发动侵略叙利亚的战争。土耳其已在叙土边境集结大量兵力，美国第六舰队也已调到东地中海。侵略战争的危机正严重地威胁着叙利亚和中东各国的独立和安全，严重地威胁着世界的和平和安全。
    我们反对侵略、保卫和平的中国人民，愤怒谴责和坚决反对美帝国主义驱使土耳其阴谋发动侵略叙利亚的罪恶行为！我们完全同情和支持叙利亚政府和人民保卫民族独立、保卫和平、反抗侵略的正义事业，我们全中国人民将和全世界爱好和平的人民一道全力支援英勇的叙利亚人民和阿拉伯人民抵抗侵略者的正义斗争。
    中国人民严正地警告美国侵略者：你们如果要发动战争，一定没有好下场，玩火者必将自焚。土耳其如继续充当美帝国主义的侵略工具，也必将自食其恶果。
    我们呼吁一切爱好和平和维护正义的人们，更紧密地团结起来，以最大的努力和有效的行动，制止和粉碎美国驱使土耳其侵略叙利亚的阴谋，坚决保卫中东和世界的和平！
