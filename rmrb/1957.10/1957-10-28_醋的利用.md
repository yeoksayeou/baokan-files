    Uses of Vinegar
    Not only people in Shanxi and Zhenjiang, but also many people in other places love to eat vinegar because it is a wonderful seasoning. Besides that, vinegar has many other uses:
    It can be used as a medicine to prevent dysentery: Scientists discovered long ago that dysentery bacilli cannot survive when they encounter acidic substances. Therefore, in the autumn when dysentery is prone to occur, we can eat more vinegar to increase the ability to kill dysentery bacteria in the stomach. Of course, we cannot drink it in large gulps. Just mix it into dishes as usual, and eat more of these dishes.
    It can be used to wash things: When washing silk fabrics, adding a small amount of vinegar to the water can keep the silk fabrics shiny.
    Copperware and aluminum ware (aluminum is what is commonly called "steel essence") that have become rusty after being used for a long time can be coated with vinegar, and then washed with water after it dries, and they will be as bright as new.
    Lamp wicks of kerosene lamps soaked in vinegar and then dried in the sun before use can reduce soot.
    Lampshades of gasoline lamps soaked in vinegar for four or five minutes, then taken out and dried in the sun before use, will last longer.
    When cooking potatoes, beef, and other foods, adding a little vinegar makes them easier to cook until tender.

    醋的利用
    不但山西人、镇江人，还有许多地方的人爱吃醋，因为醋是调味美品。除此之外，醋还有许多妙用：
    可作预防痢疾的药：科学家很早就发现，痢疾杆菌一碰到酸的东西就活不了。所以在痢疾易于流行的秋季，我们可以大大吃醋，以增加胃内杀灭痢疾菌的力量。不过当然不能大口大口地喝它，像平日一样拌在菜肴里吃就可以，只要多吃些这类菜肴。
    可以用来洗涤东西：洗涤绸缎等丝织品时，在水里面加少量的醋，能使丝织品保持原有光泽。
    铜器、铝器（铝就是平常所说的钢精），用旧生锈后，用醋涂一遍，干后再用水洗，就光亮如新。
    煤油灯的灯芯用醋浸了以后晒干再用，可以减少煤烟。
    汽油灯上的灯罩浸在醋里四、五分钟，取出晒干再用，比较经久耐用。
    在烧洋山芋、牛肉等食物时，加一点醋，比较容易烧酥。
