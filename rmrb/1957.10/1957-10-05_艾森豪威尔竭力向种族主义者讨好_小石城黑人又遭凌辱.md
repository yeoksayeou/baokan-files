Eisenhower Tries Hard to Appease Racists
Black Students in Little Rock Suffer Further Abuse

(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) New China News Agency, Washington, 4th: At a press conference on October 3rd, Eisenhower spoke about the Little Rock incident in the United States, doing his utmost to appease the racists in the South. He described the Southern governors who uphold racial segregation as "good citizens and responsible officials," and said that he did not want to obstruct any efforts by the Southern governors "to continue striving to achieve the goals in their hearts." He said that the Southern governors have not yet rescinded the order for the National Guard to prevent black children from entering middle schools, and on this issue, he hoped that the Southern governors would be patient, tolerant, and restrained. He also said that the U.S. federal troops are not stationed in the South as part of the segregation issue. Sending troops to try to order anywhere in the South what they should and should not do would be "the biggest mistake." The fact that the U.S. government sent troops to Little Rock was caused by the racial segregation issue was only "accidental."

Prior to this, on October 1st, Eisenhower held a compromising meeting with four Southern governors, and afterwards issued a statement saying that as long as Arkansas Governor Faubus guaranteed that he would "not obstruct federal court orders," he would agree to "return command of the Arkansas National Guard to the governor, and at the same time, withdraw all federal troops as quickly as possible."

However, when Faubus spoke on the evening of the 1st, he focused on defending his "consistent position." His remarks encouraged the racists in Little Rock.

With Faubus's connivance, some racists at Central High School in Little Rock once again threatened and insulted the nine black students entering the school on October 2nd.

Forty or fifty white students waited at the school gate to hurl abuse at the black students entering the school, then chased after two of the black students, knocking their schoolbags to the ground. When the two black students bent down to pick up their schoolbags, they were punched and kicked.

The National Guard, whose command had been taken over by the federal authorities, did not effectively stop the tyrannical behavior of the racists.

### 艾森豪威尔竭力向种族主义者讨好  小石城黑人又遭凌辱

    艾森豪威尔竭力向种族主义者讨好
    小石城黑人又遭凌辱
    本报综合报道　据新华社4日讯，华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔10月3日在记者招待会上谈到美国的小石城事件时，竭力向南方的种族主义者讨好。他把维护种族隔离的南方州长说成是“善良的公民和负责的官员”，并且说他并不想阻挠南部州长“为了继续争取实现他们心中的目的而进行的任何努力”。他说，南部州长目前还没有撤销要警卫队阻止黑人儿童进入中学的命令，在这个问题上，他希望南部州长要耐心、容忍和节制。他还说，美国联邦军队并不是作为隔离问题的一部分而驻在南方的。派遣军队去试图命令南方任何地方他们应当做什么和不应当做什么，是“最大的错误”。美国政府派军队到小石城一事所以由种族隔离问题引起，只不过是“偶然而已”。
    在这以前，艾森豪威尔在10月1日同南方的四名州长进行了一次妥协性的会谈，并且在会后发表声明，表示只要阿肯色州州长福巴斯保证“不阻挠联邦法院命令”，他就同意“把阿肯色州国民警卫队的指挥权交还给州长，同时，在尽可能快的时期内撤走一切联邦军队”。
    但是福巴斯在1日晚上发表谈话的时候却着重地为他的“一贯的立场”辩护。他的谈话鼓舞了小石城的种族主义分子。
    在福巴斯纵容之下，小石城中央中学的一些种族主义分子10月2日又一次对进入这个学校的九名黑人学生进行威胁和侮辱。
    有四五十个白人学生等候在校门口，对入校的黑人学生进行辱骂，接着又追赶其中两名黑人学生，把他们怀中的书包打落在地上。当这两名黑人学生俯身收拾书包的时候，他们又遭到拳打脚踢。
    已被联邦当局接管了指挥权的国民警卫队并没有有效地制止种族主义分子的暴虐行为。
