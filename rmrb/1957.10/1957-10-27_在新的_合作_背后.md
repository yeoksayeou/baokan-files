Behind the New "Cooperation"
By our correspondent Pan Fei

    When Eisenhower and Macmillan's inflammatory communique was published, all the right-wing newspapers in Britain touted it as a great success for Britain. They believed that in this Washington meeting, Britain was dealing with the United States on an "equal" footing; they hailed the "Western countries" as having "united" to deal with the so-called "threat of international communism."

    Where exactly does Britain's success lie? On the issue of amending the McMahon Act, the United States has relented. However, this still awaits discussion and decision by the United States Congress. Even if the United States amends or even abolishes this act, what does Britain gain? First: It accelerates the nuclear arms race, the result of which will burden the British economy. The annual military expenditure of 1.5 billion pounds may be breached, Britain's financial crisis will become more serious, industrial investment will inevitably continue to shrink, and Britain's competitiveness in the capitalist world market will be further weakened. Second: In exchange for American "cooperation" with Britain in the nuclear arms race, Macmillan openly expressed support for American acts of aggression in the Middle East, acting as a joint shareholder in further American adventurism. In this way, Britain is tied to the Sixth Fleet and may be dragged into the water by the United States at any time. And if a war of aggression breaks out in the Middle East, it would mean the complete collapse of the British Empire's colonial power in the Middle East.

    Have the Western countries become more "united"? The "Daily Telegraph" editorial wrote: After the Anglo-American "cooperation" in the nuclear arms race, France would "show jealousy," West Germany would "be less at ease," Italy would "demand a say," and other NATO countries would follow suit with various demands. Of course, the "Daily Telegraph" editorial has not yet touched the essence of the problem. But it can be seen that after a new "cooperation" is formed, new contradictions will follow.

    The Anglo-American meeting communique is an out-and-out declaration of war. It poses a serious threat to peace in the Middle East and the world. Judging from Britain's position and influence, and from Britain's own interests, it could have done much to ease international tensions. However, the Conservative government has no intention of taking a step in this direction. On the contrary, in this Washington meeting, Britain has taken great initiative to intensify international tensions. This attitude of Britain has caused shock among the British public. They have expressed deep concern about the outcome of the Anglo-American talks. The "Daily Herald" editorial on the 26th wrote: "Millions of people hoped to see a glimmer of hope for peace at the end of the talks, but they were disappointed." The editorial believes that the Eisenhower-Macmillan "communiqué means a cold war will continue for a considerable period. This route is not only disappointing, but also dangerous." The newspaper called on the British government to "sober up and negotiate with Soviet leaders, even if it means putting aside outdated power politics."

### 在新的“合作”背后

    在新的“合作”背后
    本报记者　潘非
    当艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦的充满火药味的公报发表以后，英国所有右翼报纸，都鼓吹这是英国的巨大成功。它们认为，这次华盛顿会谈中，英国是以“平等”的地位，同美国打交道的；它们欢呼“西方国家”已经“团结起来”，可以对付所谓“国际共产主义的威胁”。
    英国的成功究竟表现在什么地方呢？关于修改麦克马洪法的问题，美国已经松口了。但是，这还有待美国国会的讨论和决定。即使美国修改了，甚至废除了这个法案，英国获得的是什么呢？一是：加速核子军备竞赛，其结果将给英国经济背上个大包袱。每年十五亿英镑的军费开支将可能突破，英国的财政危机将更加严重，工业的投资势必继续缩减，英国在资本主义世界市场上的竞争能力将进一步削弱。二是：为了换取美国在核子军备竞赛中同英国的“合作”，麦克米伦公开地表示了支持美国在中东的侵略行为，充当美国在进一步冒险中的合伙股东。这样，英国就把自己拴在第六舰队的缆索之上，将有随时被美国拖下水去的可能。而一场侵略战争如果在中东爆发，那末这将意味着大英帝国在中东的殖民势力全部垮台。
    西方国家已更加“团结起来”了吗？“每日电讯报”的社论写道：英美在核子军备竞赛中实行“合作”以后，法国会“表示妒忌”，西德会“不太放心”，意大利会“要求插足进来”，其他的北大西洋集团国家也会随之提出种种要求。当然，“每日电讯报”的社论还远没有触及问题的本质。但是这已可以看出，当一个新的“合作”形成之后，新的矛盾将接踵而来。
    英美会谈公报是个不折不扣的战争宣言。它对中东和世界和平构成了严重威胁。从英国的地位和影响来看，从英国的本身利益着想，它本可为缓和国际紧张局势作很多事情。但是，保守党政府毫无打算朝这个方向迈出一步。相反，在这次华盛顿会谈中，英国以很大的积极性来加剧国际的紧张局势。英国的这种态度。在英国公众中引起震惊。他们对于英美会谈的结果已深表不安。“每日先驱报”26日的社论写道：“千百万人希望在会谈结束时看到一线和平前景，但是他们失望了。”社论认为，艾森豪威尔—麦克米伦的“公报意味着将在相当时期内进行冷战。这条路线不只令人失望，而且存在着危险。”这家报纸要求英国政府“清醒过来，同苏联领袖进行谈判，即使把过时了的实力政策摆在一边，也是必要的。”
