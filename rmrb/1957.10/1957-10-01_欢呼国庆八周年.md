    The great People's Republic of China, resolutely supported by the entire Chinese people and warmly supported by progressive people all over the world, is celebrating its eighth anniversary today. The masses of people across the country and our international friends all over the world are cheering and celebrating this glorious festival.
    As we begin the ninth year of the People's Republic, our people are on the eve of the victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan and are in the midst of a high tide of socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, following the high tide of socialist revolution on the economic front.
    This year is the final year of our country's First Five-Year Plan. Although there is still a quarter left until the end of the year, we have already completed and overfulfilled the basic targets of the First Five-Year Plan. The total industrial output value of our country (excluding handicrafts) already exceeded the total target of the Five-Year Plan by 9.5% last year. According to the 1957 plan, this year's total industrial output value (excluding handicrafts) will exceed the First Five-Year Plan by 12.7%. The industrial output value in 1957 will reach 223.4% of that in 1952. The amount of investment in capital construction has already met the target of the Five-Year Plan by the end of September this year and slightly exceeded it; it is expected to exceed the Five-Year Plan by more than 10% by the end of this year. In terms of agricultural production, except for cotton, the total grain output (excluding soybeans) has exceeded the 1957 production level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, and the total output value of agricultural and sideline products is close to the 1957 level. If no special disasters occur this year, the total output value of agricultural and sideline products and the total grain output (excluding soybeans) can exceed last year's level. In this way, the total agricultural output value in 1957 will reach 126.4% of that in 1952.
    Due to the rapid development of the national economy in the eight years since liberation, especially the smooth implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, the face of our country has undergone tremendous changes. Due to the construction of many important industrial enterprises and industrial bases, the rapid development of various basic industrial sectors, and the growth of technical strength, we have laid a preliminary foundation for national industrialization. Our country's agriculture has basically transformed from an individual economy to a cooperative economy and has achieved significant progress in the production of many important crops. Our country's transportation, commerce, and cultural and educational undertakings have also been greatly developed. On the basis of these developments, the material and cultural living standards of our people have been noticeably improved compared to before liberation. All these achievements are the result of the arduous struggle of the broad masses of people across the country under the leadership of the Communist Party. These achievements make the people feel proud, give the people a firm determination to defend them, and give them full confidence in looking forward to a bright future.
    Despite the brilliant victory already achieved in the First Five-Year Plan, this is still only a starting point for our great cause. Our country has more than 600 million people (of which the rural population accounts for five-sixths), and currently our industrial and agricultural production levels are not high, and therefore the people's living standards are also not high. We will need to go through two to three more Five-Year Plans to build our country into a modern industrial country and a modern agricultural country. From next year, our country will begin to implement the Second Five-Year Plan. In the Second Five-Year Plan, we must continue to work hard to develop industry, otherwise, we will not be able to establish a modern economic and modern national defense foundation, and we will not be able to implement a comprehensive technical transformation of the national economy. We must also work hard to develop agriculture, otherwise, it will not only affect the lives of the vast majority of people, but also directly hinder the rapid development of industry. Although agriculture in our country has made great progress compared to before liberation, it is still seriously lagging behind the needs of the entire national economy and the people's lives, and we must catch up with great efforts. The view that belittles agriculture and rural work is completely wrong and must be resolutely opposed. Therefore, in future construction plans, we must implement the policy of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture, on the one hand, to ensure the steady rise of the industrial economy, and on the other hand, to appropriately increase the proportion of agricultural investment.
    Industry and agriculture are two major national economic sectors that are interdependent and mutually supportive. In industry, we must adhere to the priority development of heavy industry, especially the raw material industry and the power industry, and at the same time, we must strive to develop the chemical industry and agricultural machinery industry that support agriculture. The construction of industry must adapt to our country's situation and needs, and we must implement a combination of large, medium, and small enterprises, advanced technology, and general technology, manual operation, in order to save funds and unleash potential. In agriculture, we must adhere to the practice of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically, adhere to the direction of realizing the twelve-year national agricultural development program, and strive to have the majority of cooperatives in the majority of regions catch up with and surpass the production level of local wealthy middle peasants within the next three to five years.
    All the achievements we have made in the past eight years completely depend on the victory in the people's democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. Without the victory of these two revolutions, such rapid development of our country's economy would not have been possible. Similarly, the achievements that we need to continue to achieve in the future completely depend on the completion and consolidation of the socialist revolution. We have repeatedly pointed out that our country's socialist revolution on the economic front, in terms of ownership, has basically been victorious, but on the political and ideological fronts, serious efforts are still needed.
    In the past few months, the people of our country have launched a struggle against the bourgeois rightists and launched a nationwide debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism. This is a great progress in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Now, in general, the bourgeois rightists have been isolated, and the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of people has been greatly improved. This will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the future development of our country.
    The progress of the anti-rightist struggle is uneven in various regions and units. Where the struggle has not been carried out deeply or thoroughly, or where the struggle has not yet been launched, the struggle should be continued to the end, and hasty withdrawal is not allowed. Where the struggle has been deepened, the leading organs and leading cadres should gradually shift to the stage of focusing on rectifying their work style and improving their work, while among the worker masses, peasant masses, student masses, and soldier masses, the focus should be on carrying out socialist education.
    In order to effectively rectify work style and improve work, efforts should be concentrated on solving the following three aspects:
    First, strengthen the ties between the Party and the people and overcome tendencies of sectarianism and special treatment. Communist Party members must integrate with the masses, share weal and woe, and earnestly promote a style of hard work and plain living. Leading cadres must be close to the grassroots masses and participate in physical labor. Young intellectual cadres who have not been tempered by revolutionary struggle and productive labor must go to factories and rural areas to participate in several years of productive labor or to work at the grassroots level for several years to transform and temper themselves. Leading cadres at all levels who have not been tempered by actual struggle and do not have grassroots work experience must make up for this lesson.
    Second, change some regulations in the system and organization that are not suitable for the situation and correctly solve the relationship between centralized unity and division of labor and responsibility in the work of the Party and the state. What should be centralized must be centralized, what should be decentralized must be decentralized, and what should be delegated must be delegated. The tendency of excessive centralization that promotes subjectivism and bureaucracy and the tendency of decentralism that forms anarchy and indiscipline must be overcome. Party and government management agencies must be greatly streamlined, and surplus personnel must be transferred to production posts and grassroots units that need to be strengthened.
    Third, expand democratic life within the people and continue to improve the democratic system. In handling contradictions among the people, we must adhere to the method of gentle breeze and fine rain and adhere to the formula of "unity-criticism-unity." Leading personnel at all levels must fully respect the democratic rights of the people, often listen to the opinions of the people, and sincerely accept the criticism and supervision of the people. All mass problems, whether they belong to the ideological, living, or work aspects, must be resolutely relied upon by the masses to solve, and the mass line must be resolutely implemented. The result of our doing so will inevitably further isolate the rightists, more effectively unite the masses in the middle state, make the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts achieve a more thorough victory, and at the same time, due to the high tide of mass initiative and creativity, it will inevitably be able to make the cause of socialist construction obtain smoother progress.
    The struggle of our people is not isolated. Our cause is a continuation of the great October Revolution, which will soon celebrate its fortieth anniversary. Our cause is part of the common cause of the people of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and part of the common cause of the working people and progressive humanity all over the world. In the victory we celebrate today, the people of all countries have participated with a share of strength. The solemn responsibility of our people is to always adhere unswervingly to the principle of proletarian internationalism in our struggle, and to do everything possible to continuously consolidate and strengthen the unity of the people of all socialist countries, and to consolidate and strengthen the unity of all people in the world who are fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism. Relying on this unity, no matter how ferocious and cunning the enemy is, we will inevitably be able to achieve victory.

### 欢呼国庆八周年

    欢呼国庆八周年
    全中国人民所坚决拥护、全世界进步人类所热烈支持的伟大的中华人民共和国，今天已经满第八周年了。全国各地的人民群众和我们的遍于全世界的国际友人，都在为这个光荣的节日而欢呼庆祝。
    在开始进入人民共和国的第九年的时候，我国人民正处在第一个五年计划胜利完成的前夕，正处在继经济战线上的社会主义革命高潮而来的政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命高潮中。
    今年是我国第一个五年计划的最后一年。虽然离年底还有一个季度，可是我们已经完成和超额完成了第一个五年计划的基本指标。我国的工业总产值（不包括手工业）已经在去年超额9.5％完成五年计划的总指标；按照1957年度的计划，今年工业总产值（不包括手工业）将要超额12.7％完成第一个五年计划。1957年的工业总产值，将要达到1952年的223.4％。基本建设投资额到今年9月底已经完成五年计划的指标，并且略有超过；预计到今年年底将超额10％以上完成五年计划。在农业生产方面，除了棉花以外，粮食总产量（不包括大豆）已经提前一年超过五年计划规定的1957年的生产水平，农副业总产值已经接近1957年的水平；如果今年不再发生特殊的灾害，今年农副业总产值和粮食总产量（不包括大豆）都可以超过去年的水平。这样，1957年的农业总产值，将要达到1952年的126.4％。
    由于解放以后八年来国民经济的迅速发展，特别是第一个五年计划的顺利实现，我们国家的面貌已经发生了巨大的变化。由于许多重要的工业企业和工业基地的建设，由于各种基本的工业部门的迅速发展，由于技术力量的壮大，我们已经奠定了国家工业化的初步基础。我国的农业已经基本上由个体经济转变为合作化经济，并且在许多重要作物的生产方面获得了显著的进步。我国的交通运输业、商业和文化教育事业，也都得到了重大的发展。在这些发展的基础上，我国人民的物质生活水平和文化生活水平比之解放前已经有了令人注目的提高。所有这些成就，都是全国广大人民在共产党领导下艰苦奋斗的结果。这些成就使人民感到自豪，使人民有坚强的决心加以保卫，并且有充分的信心瞻望光明的未来。
    尽管第一个五年计划已经取得光辉的胜利，这仍然不过是我们的伟大事业的一个起点。我国共有六亿多人口（其中农村人口占六分之五），目前我们的工农业生产水平都还不高，因而人民的生活水平也还不高。我们还要经过两个到三个五年计划，才能把我国建设成为一个现代化的工业国和现代化的农业国。从明年起，我国就将开始实施第二个五年计划。在第二个五年计划中，我们必须继续努力发展工业，否则就不能建立起现代经济和现代化国防的基础，就不能对国民经济实行全面的技术改造。我们也必须努力发展农业，否则就不仅会影响最大多数人的生活，而且会直接阻碍工业的迅速发展。现在我国农业虽然比解放以前已经大有进步，但是还严重地落后于整个国民经济和人民生活的需要，必须用大力赶上去。那种轻视农业、轻视农村工作的观点是完全错误的，是必须坚决反对的。因此，在今后的建设计划中，我们必须实行工农业并举的方针，一方面要保证工业经济稳步上升，一方面要适当地增加农业投资的比重。
    工业和农业是互相依赖、互相支援的两大国民经济部门。在工业方面，我们要坚持优先发展重工业，首先是原料工业和动力工业，同时要努力发展支援农业的化学工业和农业机械工业。建设工业要适应我国的情况和需要，要实行大、中、小企业相结合，先进技术和一般技术、手工操作相结合，以便节约资金，发挥潜力。在农业方面，必须坚持实行勤俭办社和民主办社，坚持实现十二年全国农业发展纲要的方向，并且在最近的三年到五年内，争取多数地区的多数合作社赶上和超过当地富裕中农的生产水平。
    我们在过去八年内所已经取得的一切成就，完全依靠人民民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，没有这两次革命的胜利，我国经济的如此迅速的发展是不可能的。同样，我们今后时期所需要继续取得的成就，完全依靠社会主义革命的完成和巩固。我们已经一再指出，我国的社会主义革命在经济战线上，在所有制方面，已经基本上胜利了，但是在政治战线和思想战线方面，却还需要进行严重的努力。
    在过去几个月中，我国人民掀起了反对资产阶级右派的斗争，展开了关于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的全民大辩论。这是社会主义革命在政治战线和思想战线上的伟大进展。现在，总的说来，资产阶级右派已经陷于孤立，广大人民群众的社会主义觉悟已经有了很大的提高。这对我们国家今后的发展无疑将产生深远的影响。
    反右派斗争在各地区各单位的进展是不平衡的。凡是斗争进行得不深不透或者还没有发动斗争的地方和单位，应当继续进行斗争，把这一斗争进行到底，决不允许草率收兵。凡是斗争已经深入的地方，在领导机关和领导干部方面应该逐渐转到着重整顿作风和改进工作的阶段，而在工人群众、农民群众、学生群众、士兵群众中间，则应着重进行社会主义教育。
    为了有效地整顿作风，改进工作，应该集中力量，解决以下三个方面的问题：
    第一，密切党同人民群众的联系，克服宗派主义和特殊化的倾向。共产党员一定要同群众打成一片，同甘共苦，认真提倡艰苦朴素的作风。领导干部一定要接近基层群众，并且参加体力劳动。凡是没有受过革命斗争锻炼和生产劳动锻炼的青年知识分子干部，一定要到工厂、农村，参加几年生产劳动，或者到基层作几年实际工作，改造和锻炼自己。各级领导干部凡是没有经过实际斗争锻炼和没有基层工作经验的，都必须补上这一课。
    第二，改变制度上和组织上的一些不适合情况的规定，正确地解决党和国家工作中集中统一和分工负责的关系。应该集中的必须集中，应该分散的必须分散，应该下放的必须下放。助长主观主义、官僚主义的过分集中的倾向，和形成无政府无纪律现象的分散主义倾向，都必须克服。党政管理机构必须大大精简，把多余的人员下放到生产岗位和需要加强的基层单位中去。
    第三，要在人民内部扩大民主生活，继续健全民主制度。处理人民内部矛盾，必须坚持和风细雨的方法，坚持“团结——批评——团结”的公式。各级领导人员必须充分尊重人民群众的民主权利，经常倾听人民群众的意见，诚心诚意地接受人民群众的批评和监督。凡是群众性的问题，无论是属于思想方面、生活方面和工作方面，都必须坚决地依靠群众去解决，坚决地贯彻群众路线。我们这样作的结果，必然能够进一步地孤立右派，更有效地团结中间状态的群众，使政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命取得更彻底的胜利，同时由于群众积极性创造性的高涨，也必然能够使社会主义建设事业获得更顺畅的进展。
    我国人民的斗争不是孤立的。我们的事业是不久即将庆祝四十周年的伟大的十月革命的继续。我们的事业是以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营各国人民的共同事业的一部分，是全世界劳动人民和进步人类的共同事业的一部分。在我们今天所欢呼庆祝的胜利中，各国人民都参加了一份力量。我国人民的庄严的责任，就是在我们的斗争中对于无产阶级国际主义的原则永远信守不渝，就是尽一切力量不断地巩固和加强社会主义各国人民的团结，巩固和加强全世界一切为和平、民主、社会主义而奋斗的人民的团结。依靠这种团结，不管敌人怎样凶恶和狡猾，我们就必然能够取得胜利。
