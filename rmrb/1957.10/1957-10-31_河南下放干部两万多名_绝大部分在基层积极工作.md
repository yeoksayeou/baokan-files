More Than 20,000 Cadres Transferred to Lower Levels in Henan; The Vast Majority Actively Work at the Grassroots

(Our newspaper dispatch) According to incomplete statistics from various levels of organizations in Henan Province, more than 24,000 staff members have now been transferred to work in grassroots units. According to statistics from six special districts, including Kaifeng, more than 5,800 district and township cadres have been sent to rural areas to directly participate in production. Among those transferred, 1,715 are division-level and section-level cadres.

Over 90% of the transferred cadres are working actively. Comrade Zhang Mingzhu, head of the Locust Control Station of the Xinxiang Special Administrative Office, was transferred to the Huating Agricultural Cooperative in Wuzhi County as the cooperative's director. He bought his own farming tools, such as hoes and manure forks, to participate in production and helped the livestock keepers raise the thin and weak animals very well.

Influenced by the transferred cadres, most of the rural cadres who were previously not content with production have become settled. Li Quanju, a cadre from the Fifth Cooperative of Guanyintang in Zhongmu County, said: "In the past, a capable person from the village would be promoted and transferred away, leaving the cooperative without leadership. Now, with the cadres being transferred down, my confidence in my work has been strengthened."

    河南下放干部两万多名
    绝大部分在基层积极工作
    本报讯　据河南省各级机关不完全统计，目前已有二万四千多名工作人员，下放到基层单位工作；据开封等六个专区统计，区、乡干部下放到农村直接参加生产的有五千八百多人。下放人员中有处长科长级干部一千七百十五人。
    下放的干部90％以上工作是积极的。新乡专署治蝗站站长张明柱同志，下放到武陟县华亭农业社当社长，自己买了锄头、粪叉等农具参加生产，并帮助饲养员把瘦弱的牲口喂养得很好。
    在下放干部的影响下，一些原来不安心生产的农村干部大部分都安心了。中牟县观音堂五社干部李全聚说：“过去村里出个能干人就被提拔走了，弄得社里无人领导，现在把干部放下来，增强了我的工作信心。”
