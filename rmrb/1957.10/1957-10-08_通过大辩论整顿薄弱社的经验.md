Experiences in Rectifying Weak Cooperatives Through Great Debate
    Zhang Shiying

    Qixin Agricultural Cooperative is a weak cooperative in Yongji County, Jilin Province. The cooperative has 453 households, 715 male and female laborers, and 1351 hectares of cultivated land.

    The main weak links in the work of Qixin Cooperative are, firstly, poor production. This year, 406 hectares of land were left uncultivated. Due to the lack of a responsibility system in production management, four out of six water pumps broke down, and thirteen carts were damaged in the past two years, with twenty-two livestock deaths. Secondly, the operation and management are chaotic, and many basic systems have not been established. For example, only contracting of work was carried out, not contracting of output. There was no strict responsibility system established for the use, feeding, and care of livestock and the safekeeping of agricultural tools and supplies. Democratic management was very poor, financial accounts were not published on time, and members had over 25,000 yuan in labor income that had not been claimed; another group of members had overdrawn more than 8,000 yuan. Thirdly, the cooperative cadres were irresponsible in their work, lacked unity, and most had selfish tendencies. Fourthly, the combat effectiveness of the Party organization was not strong. The Party's political and ideological work for the members was weak, the labor attendance rate was very low (only 65% during the busy farming season), the capitalist tendencies of the well-to-do middle peasants were serious, 43 households openly proposed withdrawing from the cooperative and going it alone, and more than 100 households were wavering. A few Party member cadres lost their stand and supported the rich peasants' counter-offensive.

    Unifying Thoughts Within the Party, Raising Awareness

    At the beginning of the rectification, a joint meeting of Party and Youth League members was convened to convey the Central Committee's instructions on "conducting a large-scale socialist education for the entire rural population." After discussion, Party and Youth League members clarified that the realization of agricultural collectivization only changed the ownership system, establishing the socialist system economically; however, some peasants still had ideological fluctuations after joining the cooperative, and some were still hesitant. They did not wholeheartedly want to run the cooperative well. Some people still missed private ownership and going it alone, and still wanted to take the capitalist road. They were not of one mind with the cooperative, but of two minds. We must resolve the question of who wins and who loses between the socialist and capitalist roads, and who is superior and who is inferior, ideologically through a great debate in the countryside; at the same time, solve the problems of Party rectification and cooperative consolidation through the great debate. After discussion, Party and Youth League members clarified the methods and steps of the great debate, and their enthusiasm and awareness greatly increased. They all expressed their willingness to lead the masses in conducting the great debate well.

    Relying on Party and Youth League Members to Lead the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" (Speaking Out Freely)

    Hold cooperative member meetings by production team (absorbing individual households and landlords and rich peasants), repeatedly explain the purpose of this movement, dispel the ideological concerns of the masses, and mobilize the masses to speak out freely on issues such as unified purchase and sale of grain, collectivization, urban-rural relations, and compliance with the law, and boldly raise questions, offer opinions, and criticize anyone. At first, the masses were afraid of retaliation and feared that problems would not be solved even if they were raised. After repeated mobilization, Party and Youth League members took the lead in inspiring and guiding, and the "speaking out freely" movement quickly unfolded.

    The leadership should let go and boldly mobilize the masses, not be afraid of chaos, and not rush to refute. Only in this way can the dissatisfaction and confused thoughts of the various rural strata on issues such as grain and collectivization be fully expressed, and those who are determined to take the capitalist road can be exposed.

    The organizational form of "speaking out freely" should be flexible and diverse, combining meetings inside and outside, individual conversations, and casual chats during production. In the process of "speaking out freely," Party and Youth League members should be educated to pay close attention to the ideological dynamics and activities of various rural strata. Generally, poor and lower-middle peasants speak actively and enthusiastically at meetings; some of the well-to-do middle peasants speak out at meetings, while most discuss and move around outside the meetings, secretly manipulating the "speaking out freely," encouraging the masses, attacking the Party and cooperative leadership, and inciting withdrawal from the cooperative; landlords and rich peasants do not speak at meetings, but encourage the well-to-do middle peasants behind the scenes, offering advice and suggestions.

    The main problems raised in the "speaking out freely" were that 530 catties of grain retained for the Three Fixes policy were not enough to eat; some upper-middle peasants said that "advanced cooperatives are not as good as elementary cooperatives, elementary cooperatives are not as good as mutual aid teams, and mutual aid teams are not as good as going it alone," "life is not as good now as it was in the past, and both eating and working are restricted," and "peasants are not as good as workers," etc.

    Relying on Party and Youth League Members and Activists to Organize the Great Debate

    Preparation must be made, and key personnel must be cultivated and trained. After "speaking out freely," Qixin Cooperative cultivated and trained more than 120 Party and Youth League members, poor and lower-middle peasant activists. They were educated to understand that this great debate is a struggle between two roads, a revolution on the ideological front, so that they could understand the significance and methods of the debate, and organize them to find evidence and present facts based on local conditions, and use recollections to compare the living conditions of the old and new societies, to criticize various erroneous remarks and educate the masses.

    Select a few typical figures of well-to-do middle peasants who are dissatisfied with collectivization, encourage withdrawal from the cooperative and going it alone, and want to take the capitalist road, and conduct ideological criticism and rational struggle, so that the masses can initially guide the center of the debate to the struggle between the two roads. Only in this way can the class consciousness of the masses be rapidly improved, the majority be united and won over, and the minority be isolated and disintegrated. In the beginning, several teams debated whether 530 catties of grain was enough to eat and whether advanced cooperatives had advantages, but all failed. Because this cooperative this year shared a total of 70,000 catties of seeds and some unallocated soil rice left over from reclaiming wasteland, averaging it out to supplement the cooperative members' grain, this created an artificial grain shortage, allowing the well-to-do middle peasants to use the weakness that peasants had generally received more grain, and shout in unison that 530 catties was not enough to eat. At the same time, the well-to-do middle peasants used the peasants' opinions on some of the cooperative's work to manipulate the meeting to deny the advantages of collectivization. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants on the work of the cooperative and the words and deeds of the well-to-do middle peasants who deny the advantages of collectivization, attempt to incite members to withdraw from the cooperative, and take the capitalist road. To this end, after research by activists, the capitalist ideas of well-to-do middle peasants Sun Qi, Li Jinshan, and Wang Junlin were selected and criticized. Their characteristics are that they had different degrees of exploitation before and after the land reform, were accustomed to taking advantage of loopholes and engaging in speculation and profiteering, and some had a very bad reputation. They were hesitant when joining the cooperative and were swept in by the high tide of collectivization. After joining the cooperative, they were not active in labor, and often spread dissatisfaction with the cooperative, taking the lead in inciting withdrawal from the cooperative. For example, before the land reform, Sun Qi cultivated 86 hectares of land (most of which was rented), had five carts, six male laborers, and eight female laborers of his own, hired few long-term workers, and hired a large number of short-term workers during the busy farming season (actually a tenant rich peasant). He still had exploitation after the land reform, was very harsh to his hired workers, worked on the sidelines in the cooperative, was lazy in his work, stole the cooperative's manure to his own garden, and did not compensate for the loss of the cooperative's lame cattle. He often advocated speculation and profiteering by going it alone, and secretly promoted withdrawal from the cooperative during the "speaking out freely." Before joining the cooperative, Li Jinshan used rubber-wheeled carts for speculation. His brother was a horse trader, selling livestock, buying and selling empty-handed, and renting out thirty or forty cattle, charging eight dou to one shi of rent per head of cattle. Before joining the cooperative, Wang Junlin had many livestock and agricultural implements. In the mutual aid team, he relied on exchanging work and hiring odd jobs for exploitation, cultivating twelve hectares of land and two hectares of vegetable gardens. After the exposure and criticism of these people, and the comparison between the new and old two roads, the poor and lower-middle peasants generally realized that their criticisms and opinions of the cooperative were for improving the work and running the cooperative well; the well-to-do middle peasants wanted to undermine the cooperative, take the capitalist road, and re-exploit others. After the debate, they all admitted their mistakes. Sun Qi said, "I was wrong. I always wanted to get rich personally. Everyone's opinions are helping me transform my old ideas. I welcome them." Some poor peasants examined themselves and said, "If we didn't have this discussion, we would have been led down the wrong path without even knowing it." On the grain issue, after criticizing the behavior of upper-middle peasants such as Wang Junlin for selling grain at high prices on the free market, wasting grain in various ways to improve their lives, receiving more grain from the cooperative, and deliberately creating a tense atmosphere of grain shortage, the mood of clamoring that 530 catties was not enough to eat was also reversed.

    Based on the criticisms and opinions raised by the cooperative members in the "speaking out freely," the cooperative cadres took the initiative to conduct self-criticism at the cooperative member meeting and published the financial accounts, easing the contradiction between the cadres and the masses. The work team conducted positive education for the masses on the four issues of the debate, clarified the masses' confused thoughts, raised their awareness, united the majority, and isolated the minority. After the meeting, the criticism of the capitalist ideas of the well-to-do middle peasants was further deepened. Each production team systematically organized poor and hired peasants to compare the new and old societies, and refuted the remarks of a few upper-middle peasants that life was not as good as in the past, using concrete facts to compare eating grain, eating oil, and wearing cloth during the puppet Manchuria period with the present, proving that the lives of peasants have greatly improved compared to the puppet Manchuria period. They exposed who lived well in the past in the countryside, and how they exploited it. They organized people who had worked in the city or had children and relatives working in the city to introduce the real life of urban workers, explaining the great contributions of workers to national construction, and carried out education on the worker-peasant alliance. Lower-middle peasant Jiang Guolu said, "After listening to the work team's report, I learned that the national average consumption of grain is less than 500 catties per person, and in many provinces within the customs, only 360 catties are retained per person. We retain 530 catties per person and are still not satisfied. We are eating too wastefully. As long as we save a little, it is completely enough." Tian Xide said, "We cannot only think about what is appropriate for ourselves, but also support the country, support the disaster areas and cotton-producing areas. Otherwise, we do not grow cotton and only eat grain, and we will freeze to death." Hired peasant Qian Hongqing cried sadly when recalling the life of the puppet Manchuria and accusing the landlord of exploitation! All the people at the meeting were moved to tears. The comparison of new and old lives is another vivid class education for peasants.

    Relying on the poor peasants to unite the middle peasants, a cooperative-wide meeting was held to struggle against the rich peasant element Pan Decai, who engaged in counter-settlement. He used various methods such as sending money and inviting people to dinner to win over the cadres. With the support of the cadres behind the scenes (director of the public security committee, deputy director of the cooperative, former branch secretary) who had lost their position, he extorted a room and a half of house back from the poor peasant Pan Xiang. At the struggle meeting, the peasants, with excited hearts, exposed his various destructive activities. Huang Fengchun, who had worked for him as a long-term worker, accused and exposed his consistent hatred of poor and hired peasants, and his evil deeds of repeatedly wooing cadres to go down the drain, which aroused the anger of the masses even more. The members of each team also exposed on the spot the activities of six rich peasant elements, including Zhao Yongjiang and Wang Dianxin, who, after having their rich peasant hats removed and joining the cooperative, did not abide by the law and reform themselves through labor, but consistently violated labor discipline, even scolding cadres, beating members, stealing the cooperative's public property and crops, and inciting members to withdraw from the cooperative. After discussion, the members unanimously decided to revoke their membership, put the rich peasant hats back on, and control their production in the cooperative, and requested the judicial organs to punish the rich peasant element Pan Decai for counter-settlement according to law.

    In the debate, we must adhere to the spirit of presenting facts, reasoning, and fully explaining the reasons. However, the methods of criticizing the capitalist ideas of the well-to-do middle peasants and fighting against the reactionary activities of the rich peasants must be distinguished. The well-to-do middle peasants must be allowed to refute and debate. For the rich peasant elements, the masses do not allow them to debate, but require them to stand up and confess in public, and bow their heads to admit their guilt. In this way, the masses and cadres can learn to distinguish in principle in the methods of handling contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. Some well-to-do middle peasants initially felt that after being criticized, some poor and lower-middle peasants also said some things in the "speaking out freely" that were dissatisfied with the cooperative and the unified purchase and sale, but only they themselves were criticized in the debate, feeling that it was unfair. After the struggle against the rich peasants, they felt that everyone treated them very differently from the rich peasants, and they became more active and closer to the Party and the poor peasants.

    On the basis of the general improvement of the masses' awareness, inspire everyone to examine their capitalist and selfish ideas through self-criticism, and establish the idea of abiding by the law, abiding by labor discipline, running the cooperative diligently and frugally, managing the family diligently and frugally, and the unity of loving the country, loving the cooperative, and loving the family.

    Consolidate the Organization, Make a Good Autumn Harvest Distribution Plan

    On the basis of the great debate, the Party branch was consolidated, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out within the Party, criticizing the ideas of Party members who buried themselves in production without asking about politics and selfishness. The Party and external duties of Bai Yupu and Wang Falin (deputy director), members of the branch committee who lost their position and supported the rich peasants' counter-settlement, were revoked, and they were given the punishment of being placed on probation within the Party for one year.

    The director of the cooperative's public security committee was dismissed from his post by a resolution of the cooperative member meeting.

    The Communist Youth League and women's federation organizations were also consolidated.

    After discussion from top to bottom and from bottom to top, the cooperative member meeting finally resolved to revise the plan for contracting work, contracting output, and contracting finances, and adopted the autumn harvest distribution plan, and studied and formulated a system of unified leadership, hierarchical management, and division of power between the cooperative and the teams.

    通过大辩论整顿薄弱社的经验
    张士英
    齐心农业社，是吉林永吉县的一个薄弱社。全社四百五十三户，男女劳动力七百一十五个，耕地一千三百五十一公顷。
    齐心社工作上主要的薄弱环节，首先是生产搞得不好，今年撩荒地四百零六公顷，由于生产管理上没有责任制度，六台抽水机坏了四台，两年来大车损坏了十三辆，牲畜死亡二十二头。其次，经营管理混乱，许多基本制度没有建立，如只进行了包工，没有包产，没有严格建立牲畜的使役饲养和农具物品保管的责任制度，民主管理很差，财务账目没有按期公布，社员有两万五千多元的劳动收入未领回去；另一部分社员超支八千多元。第三，社干部工作不负责任，互不团结，大部分有自私自利行为。第四，党的组织战斗力不强，党对社员的政治思想工作薄弱，劳动出勤率很低（农忙时只65％），富裕中农资本主义思想严重，有四十三户公开提出退社单干，有一百多户正在动摇。少数党员干部丧失立场，支持富农反攻倒算。
    统一党内思想，提高认识
    在开始整社之初，就召开党团员联席会议，传达了中央关于“向全体农村人口进行一次大规模的社会主义教育”的指示，经过讨论，使党团员明确了：农村实现合作化，仅是改变了所有制，从经济上确立了社会主义制度；但有些农民入社后思想上还常有波动，还有些三心二意，他们不是一心一意想把合作社办好，有些人还留恋私有制和单干，还想走资本主义道路，他们对合作社还不是一条心而是两条心。我们要在农村通过大辩论，从思想上解决社会主义和资本主义两条道路谁胜谁负、谁优谁劣的问题；同时通过大辩论解决整党整社问题。经过讨论，党团员明确了大辩论的方法和步骤，情绪和觉悟大大提高，都表示愿意领导群众搞好大辩论。
    依靠党团员，领导鸣放
    按生产队召开社员大会（吸收单干户和地主富农参加），反复地讲解这次运动的目的，解除群众思想顾虑，发动群众就粮食统购统销、合作化、城乡关系、遵守法制等问题，大鸣大放，大胆提问题、提意见、批评任何人。开始群众怕打击报复，怕提了也不解决问题。经过反复动员，党团员带头启发诱导，鸣放运动迅速开展起来了。
    领导放手，大胆发动群众，不要怕乱，不要急于反驳，只有这样，才能使农村各阶层群众对粮食、合作化等问题的不满情绪和糊涂思想，充分鸣放出来，才能够把坚决想走资本主义道路的人暴露出来。
    组织鸣放的形式要灵活多样，要把会内会外、个别谈话、生产中闲谈结合起来。在鸣放过程中，要教育党团员密切注意农村各阶层的思想动态和活动。一般是贫农、下中农在会上发言积极踊跃；富裕中农则一部分在会内鸣放，大部分在会外议论活动，暗地操纵鸣放，鼓励群众，攻击党和社的领导，煽动退社；地主富农则会上不发言，背后鼓动富裕中农，出谋划策。
    在鸣放中提出的问题，主要有三定留粮五百三十斤不够吃；有的上中农提出“高级社不如初级社，初级社不如互助组，互助组不如单干”，“现在生活不如过去好，吃粮、干活都受限制”，“农民不如工人”等等。
    依靠党团员和积极分子，组织大辩论
    要做好准备，培养训练好骨干。齐心社鸣放后培养训练了党团员、贫农和下中农积极分子一百二十多人。对他们进行了教育，说明这次大辩论是两条道路的斗争，是思想战线上的革命，使他们了解争辩的意义和方法，组织他们根据本地情况，找根据摆事实，用回忆对比新旧社会生活情况，来批判各种错误言论，教育群众。
    选择少数富裕中农不满合作化、鼓动退社单干、想走资本主义道路的典型人物，进行思想批判和说理斗争，使群众一开始就把辩论的中心引向两条道路的斗争上来，只有这样才能迅速提高群众的阶级觉悟，团结和争取多数，孤立和分化少数。开始有几个队辩论五百三十斤留粮够吃不够吃，高级合作社有没有优越性，结果都失败了。因为该社今年从水田撩荒剩下的种籽及未分的一些土稻子共七万斤，平均分给社员补助吃粮，这就造成人为的粮食紧张情况，使富裕中农能够利用农民普遍多领了吃粮的弱点，一致叫喊五百三十斤不够吃。同时富裕中农利用农民对合作社工作上的一些意见，操纵会场否认合作社优越性。因此，必须把贫农与下中农对合作社工作上的意见和富裕中农否定合作化优越性、企图鼓动社员退社、走资本主义道路的言行区别开来。为此，经过积极分子研究，选择和重点揭发批判了富裕中农孙起、李金山、王俊林三人的资本主义思想，他们的特点是，土改前后都有程度不同的剥削，惯于沾尖取巧、投机倒把，有的人缘很臭，他们入社时动摇不定，被合作化高潮卷了进来，入社后又不积极劳动，经常散播对合作社不满言论，带头鼓动退社。如孙起土改前种过八十六公顷地（大部分是租入的），有五辆车，自己有六个男劳动力，八个女劳动力，雇长工少，农忙时大量雇短工（实际上是佃富农），土改后仍有剥削，对待雇工很苛薄，入社后干活沾尖取巧，消极怠工，偷社的大粪上自己园田，使瘸了社的牛也不赔偿损失，经常鼓吹单干投机倒把，鸣放时背后活动退社。李金山入社前拴胶轮车倒把，他哥哥是马贩子，倒卖牲畜，买空卖空，并在外出租三、四十条牛，每头牛八斗到一石租。王俊林入社前牲畜农具多，在互助组内靠换工和雇零工剥削，种地十二公顷和两公顷菜园子。经过对这些人的揭发批判，进行新旧两条道路的对比以后，贫农和下中农普遍觉悟到：他们对合作社提出批评和意见是为了改进工作，办好合作社；富裕中农则是想搞垮合作社，走资本主义道路，重新剥削别人。经过争辩他们都认了错。孙起说“我想错了，总是想个人发财，大家提意见是帮助我改造旧思想，我欢迎”。有的贫农检讨说：“要不叫这一讨论，自己叫人家拉到什么道路上去了，还不知道呢”。在粮食问题上，批判了上中农王俊林等在自由市场上高价出卖粮食、用各种方法浪费粮食改善生活、向合作社多领吃粮、故意制造粮食紧张空气的行为后，叫嚷五百三十斤不够吃的情绪也扭转过来了。
    社干部根据鸣放中社员提出的批评和意见，主动向社员大会进行了检讨和自我批评，并公布了财务账目，缓和了干部与群众的矛盾。工作组对群众就辩论的四个问题进行了正面教育，澄清了群众的糊涂思想，提高了觉悟，团结了多数，孤立了少数。会后进一步深入了对富裕中农资本主义思想的批判，各生产队系统的组织贫雇农用新旧社会对比的办法，逐项批驳了少数上中农说生活不如过去的言论，用具体事实对比了伪满吃粮、吃油、穿布等和现在的对比，证明农民生活比伪满是大大提高了。揭发了过去农村生活好的是些什么人，他们是怎么剥削得来的。并组织在城市作过工或有子弟和亲戚在城市作工的人，介绍城市工人的真实生活情况，说明工人对国家建设的伟大贡献，进行了工农联盟的教育。下中农蒋国禄说：“听了工作组报告，知道全国每人平均吃粮还不到五百斤，关内许多省每人才留三百六十斤，我们每人留五百三十斤还不知足，我们吃的太浪费了，只要节省一点，完全够吃了”。田喜德说：“我们不能光想自己合适，也得支援国家，支援灾区和产棉区，要不然我们又不种棉花，光吃粮不得冻死”。雇农钱洪清在回忆伪满生活控诉地主剥削时，难过得哭了！感动得全队开会的人都掉了泪。新旧生活对比是对农民又一次活的阶级教育。
    依靠贫农团结中农，召开全社大会，斗争了反攻倒算的富农分子潘得才，他利用送钱请吃饭等各种办法，拉拢干部，在干部（治保委员会主任，合作社副主任，前任支书）丧失立场背后支持下，向贫农潘祥倒算回房子一间半，在斗争大会上，农民以激奋的心情，揭发了他的各种破坏活动，给他当过长工的黄凤春控诉和揭发了他一贯仇视贫雇农、几次拉拢干部下水的罪恶事实，更激起了群众的气愤。各队社员并当场揭发了富农分子赵永江、王殿信等六人，在摘掉富农帽子入社以后，不是安分守法在劳动中改造自己，而是一贯不遵守劳动纪律，甚至谩骂干部，打骂社员，偷盗社内公共财产和庄稼，煽动社员退社的活动。经过讨论，社员一致决定撤消他们的社员资格，重新戴上富农帽子，在社内管制生产，并请求司法机关依法惩办反攻倒算的富农分子潘得才。
    在辩论中必须坚持摆事实，讲道理，充分说理的精神。但对批判富裕中农的资本主义思想和斗争富农的反动活动，在方式上必须加以区别。必须允许富裕中农反驳和争辩。对富农分子，群众则不允许他们争辩，要他们站起来当众交代，低头认罪。这样使群众和干部学会了在处理人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾的方法上应有原则的区别。有的富裕中农开始被批判后，还感到在鸣放中，有些贫农和下中农也讲了某些不满合作社和统购统销的话，但辩论中只批判了自己，感到不公，在斗争了富农后，感到大家对待自己还是与富农大不相同，就更加积极起来，更加靠拢了党和贫农。
    在群众普遍提高觉悟的基础上，启发大家通过自我批评，检查了自己的资本主义和自私自利的思想，树立遵守法制、遵守劳动纪律，勤俭办社、勤俭治家与爱国爱社爱家相一致的思想。
    整顿组织，做好秋收分配计划
    在大辩论的基础上，整顿了党的支部，在党内开展了批评和自我批评，批判了党员中埋头生产不问政治和自私自利的思想，对丧失立场支持富农倒算的支委白玉璞、王发林（副主任）撤消党内外职务，给以留党察看一年的处分。
    对合作社治安保卫委员会主任，经社员大会决议撤消职务。
    对共青团和妇联组织也进行了整顿。
    经过自上而下和自下而上的讨论，最后由社员大会决议修订了包工包产包财务的计划，通过了秋收分配方案，研究制订了统一领导、分级管理、社队分权的制度。
