Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The general survey and collation work of the Dong language has come to a preliminary conclusion.

    Over the past year, members of the First Working Team for Minority Language Surveys of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have gone deep into fourteen counties inhabited by the Dong people in the three provinces of Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi, and surveyed twenty-two linguistic points. With the enthusiastic support of the Dong people, they recorded 130,000 words and 8,000 sentences, and collected many Dong stories and cultural materials. Based on these materials, the survey team has compiled a Dong language survey report, proposing to divide the Dong language into two dialects, Southern and Northern, with the Southern dialect as the base dialect, and Rongjiang County, Guizhou Province, as the standard pronunciation point. This opinion was unanimously approved by the Dong representatives present at the preparatory meeting for the Dong Language and Writing Scientific Discussion held in Guiyang from September 27th to 30th.

    The Dong ethnic group is a nation in our country with a rich cultural tradition, with a total population of about 800,000, living in mountainous areas bordering Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces, and has never had its own writing system. Experts will create a writing system for the Dong people based on this survey.

    侗族语言调查整理工作告一段落
    调查队提出了创制文字的初步意见
    据新华社讯　侗族语言普遍调查整理工作已初步告一段落。
    中国科学院少数民族语言调查第一工作队的队员们，一年来分别深入贵州、湖南、广西三省十四个侗族居住的县份，调查了二十二个语言点。他们在侗族人民热情支持下，记录了十三万个词和八千个句子，并且收集了许多侗族故事和人文资料。根据这些材料，调查队已经整理出侗语调查工作报告，提出把侗语划分为南、北两个方言，以南部方言为基础方言，以贵州省榕江县为标准音点的初步意见。9月27日到30日在贵阳举行的侗族语言文字科学讨论会预备会上，这个意见获得到会侗族代表的一致赞同。
    侗族是我国一个有着丰富文化传统的民族，人口共约八十万，聚居在贵州、湖南、广西三省接壤的山区，历来没有自己的文字。专家们将根据这次调查，为侗族人民创制文字。
