    A Book of Grievances
    Yang Damao
    A book of grievances, placed before my eyes,
    Who could look at it and not feel chilled to the bone?
    “Zhang San took five *shi* of my fields,
    Li Si occupies two rooms of my house,
    Zhao Yulan, that dog of a girl,
    Wore out my third daughter's foreign dress…”
    A book of grievances, placed before my eyes,
    Every drop of water, every blade of grass, meticulously recorded;
    Six large characters on the cover:
    "A gentleman takes revenge in ten years!"
               August 7, Changshou, Sichuan

    一本账
    杨大矛
    一本账，摆在眼前，
    谁看了能不心寒？
    “张三分了我田五石，
    李四占了我房两间，
    赵玉兰那狗丫头，
    穿烂了我三小姐的洋衣衫……”
    一本账，摆在眼前，
    滴水、寸草记详端；
    六个大字题封面：
    “君子报仇十年！”
                8月7日四川长寿
