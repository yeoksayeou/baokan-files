Grain Production Should Be the Priority, Not Sideline Production
Chenmen Township Expands Winter Planting Area After Debate

(Reported by this newspaper) Fuzhou, Fujian Province, Chenmen Township adopted the correct method of debating whatever needs to be done. It conducted debates on the issue of winter planting, making the masses realize that winter planting is beneficial to both supporting national construction and improving the lives of farmers. This greatly increased the farmers' enthusiasm for winter planting, resulting in a planned winter planting area this year that is 27.8% larger than last year.

At the debate, the question of whether agricultural cooperatives should prioritize grain production or sideline production was hotly debated first. As soon as the question was raised, poor and lower-middle peasants expressed their opinions one after another. Poor peasant Fu Shiyuan said, "Agricultural cooperatives should engage in legitimate sideline occupations, but grain production must be the priority. Industrial construction needs grain, and we farmers need to produce more grain to improve our lives. If we don't produce grain ourselves and only ask the government to subsidize our rice, where will the government get so much rice? In my opinion, expanding winter planting is beneficial to both the public and ourselves." Lower-middle peasant Zheng Shiwei also said, "Some people say that winter planting is not as good as sideline occupations. This is not correct. It seems that I can earn a few more yuan a month by working as a boatman, but transportation depends on the weather. Sometimes, one trip requires half a month of rest, and the income is unstable. Winter planting guarantees a harvest if you plant. The more you plant, the more you harvest. With sufficient grain, you can sell surplus grain for money." Woman Huang Ruiying also said, "Grain is the most precious treasure. Expanding winter planting in agricultural cooperatives has three advantages: selling wheat to the state to support industrial construction is good; more planting and harvesting increase farmers' income is good; more grain harvested ensures sufficient self-sufficiency and improves life is good." Through discussion, the farmers in the township clarified that increasing grain production should be the priority, and expanding winter planting is a good way to increase grain production.

Farmers knew that winter planting was a good way to increase production, but some well-to-do middle peasants believed that winter-planted grain would be subject to unified purchase, which was "not worthwhile" for farmers. Well-to-do middle peasant Zheng Nuansue (female) said, "Winter planting is good, but the government purchases too much wheat, leaving farmers with nothing to eat. It's really disappointing!" "Is too much purchased? Is there nothing left to eat after the purchase?" Lower-middle peasant Lin Jiayi said, "Our team planted twenty mu of wheat last year. Although the harvest was not good, we still harvested 3,900 jin. The government only purchased 800 jin of wheat from us, leaving 3,100 jin. Each member was allocated more than one dan. My family was allocated more than two dan. How can you say that too much was purchased and there was nothing left to eat?" Lin Zhishen used concrete facts to calculate a large account: Last year, the two cooperatives in the township planted 700 mu of wheat and barley, averaging 200 jin per mu, totaling 140,000 jin. The state only purchased 40,000 jin of wheat and 10,000 jin of barley, leaving more than 90,000 jin of wheat and barley for members to eat. To say there was nothing to eat is just the ranting of some well-to-do middle peasants.

Lin Jiade, a well-to-do middle peasant in the Aoli Production Team, said when he heard the discussion about winter planting, "Winter planting is guaranteed to lose money. Last year, one labor day for winter planting only earned nine jiao. If we plant again this year, one labor day might not even earn one jiao and seven fen." All the production teams in the township started a debate on this issue. Lin Tianguan, a lower-middle peasant in the same team as Lin Jiade, said to Lin Jiade, "You said winter planting is guaranteed to lose money. Two years ago, we planted ten mu, and the average yield per mu was nearly 300 jin. We sold it for 36 yuan, and the cost was only 15 or 16 yuan. We earned 20 yuan. We only earned 110 work points, which is more than one jiao and two fen per point. Is this losing money or increasing income?" Team leader Lin Jiadong also continued, "Last year, our team planted thirteen mu of wheat. Although it rained a lot this spring, the yield was not high, but we still harvested more than 2,800 jin. If you say we lost money, what did we lose? Even if the value of work points is lower, it can't be considered a loss. We farmers can't only calculate profit and loss. We should say that if we do something, we will have income. If we do nothing, we won't even have a single piece of income." Some people also said that increasing grain production is beneficial to the country and the family. The capitalist ideology of only calculating how much money is made and ignoring national interests is unacceptable. After listening to everyone, Lin Jiade had a correct view of winter planting. He said, "Of course, planting is better than not planting. I was wrong at first!"

### 应该以粮食生产为主，不应以副业生产为主  城门乡经过辩论扩大冬种面积

    应该以粮食生产为主，不应以副业生产为主
    城门乡经过辩论扩大冬种面积
    本报讯　福建闽侯城门乡采用了要作什么就辩论什么的正确方法，对冬种问题进行了辩论，使群众认识到冬种对支援国家建设和改善农民生活都有好处，因而大大提高了农民冬种的积极性，使今年计划冬种的面积比去年扩大27.8％。
    在辩论会上，首先热烈讨论了农业社到底要以粮食生产为主，还是以副业生产为主的问题。问题一提出，贫农、下中农就纷纷发表意见，贫农傅仕元说：“农业社正当的副业也是要搞的，但是，不管怎样都要以粮食为主。工业化建设要粮食，我们农民要改善生活也要多生产粮食；自己不生产粮食，光向政府要补销米，政府那里去拿那么多米来。依我看，扩大冬种是公私两利。”下中农郑仕位也说：“有人说冬种不如搞副业，这话说的不对头，像我搞撑船副业，外表看来一个月可以多赚几元钱，但是，搞运输要看风吃饭，有时运一次歇半月，收入不稳定。冬种是有种有收，多种多收，粮食不缺，卖了余粮还有钱。”妇女黄瑞英也说：“粮食是宝中宝，农业社扩大冬种有三好：把麦子卖给国家支援工业建设好；多种多收农民增加收入好；粮食打得多自留粮足改善生活好。”全乡农民通过讨论都明确了要以增产粮食为主，而扩大冬种又是增产粮食的好办法。
    冬种是增产的好办法，农民是知道了，但是还有些富裕中农认为冬种粮食要统购，农民“不合算”。富裕中农郑暖雪（女）说：“冬种好是好，就是小麦政府统购太多了，农民有种没有吃，干的真扫兴！”“是不是统购太多呢？是不是统购了就没吃呢？”下中农林家宜说：“我们队里去年种了二十亩小麦，虽然收成不好，也收了三千九百斤，政府只购我们八百斤小麦，还剩下三千一百斤，分配给社员每户都分一担多，我家就分了二担多，怎能说购得太多没有吃了呢？”林知深用具体事实算了一个大账：全乡去年两社种大小麦七百亩，每亩平均收二百斤，计十四万斤，国家只统购四万斤小麦、一万斤大麦，还有九万多斤大小麦留给社员吃。说没有吃，只是有的富裕中农乱叫喊。
    鳌里生产队富裕中农林家德听到讨论冬种就说：“冬种包亏本，去年冬种一个劳动日只分九角，今年再种，一个劳动日怕分不到一角七分。”全乡各个生产队对这个问题展开了辩论。和林家德同一小队的下中农林天官对林家德说：“你说冬种包亏本，前年我们种十亩，每亩平均收的将近三百斤，卖了三十六元，本钱只花十五、六元，还赚二十元，工分只有一百一十分，每分一角二分多，这是亏本还是增收了呢？”小队长林家冬也接着说：“去年我们小队种了十三亩小麦，虽然今年春天多雨，产量不高，也收了二千八百多斤；要说亏本，那来的本亏。就是工分价值低一些也不能算做亏本。我们种田人可不能光算盈亏，应该说有做就有收入，不做就连一片也没收入。”还有人说增产粮食对国对家都有利，专门计算赚钱多少不顾国家利益的资本主义思想是要不得的。林家德听了大家的话，对冬种有了正确的看法，他说：“当然种比没种好，当初是我想错了！”
