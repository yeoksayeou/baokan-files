    The Changqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ganzhou Township, Fengxin County, Jiangxi Province, has established a medical and health care room. This health care room has one doctor, two trainees, one health worker, and one midwife. The small pharmacy is stocked with more than 140 kinds of commonly used medicines. Since its establishment in September 1956, it has treated more than 11,000 people-times of cooperative members. The cooperative members call it "small hospital."
    This health care room implements overall medical care, stipulating that cooperative members participate voluntarily. Each participating household deducts 2 yuan from their labor income for medical expenses, which is collectively contracted by the cooperative.
    In this year, this health care room cured sixteen cases of scrofula, six cases of hookworm disease, and five cases of goiter; in the three months of June, July, and August this year, it also distributed more than 2,000 tablets of chloroquine hydrochloride, preventing malaria in 180 people. The health care room also conducted prenatal check-ups on 73 pregnant women in the cooperative and delivered 42 babies using new methods. (Yi Deyuan)

    农业社的小医院
    江西省奉新县乾洲乡长青农业生产合作社建立了一个医疗保健室。这个保健室有一位医生，两个练习生，一个保健员，一个接生员。小药房里贮备有一百四十多种常用药品。从1956年9月成立以来，已经为社员诊病一万一千多人次。社员管它叫“小医院”。
    这个保健室实行统筹医疗，规定社员自愿参加。参加户每人从劳动收入中扣出医药费二元，由社统一包干。
    这个保健室在这一年里，治好了十六个鬁鬁，六个钩虫病人，五个甲状腺肿病人；在今年6、7、8三个月内，还发了二千多片盐酸氯胍，预防了一百八十人的疟疾。保健室还对社里的七十三名孕妇，进行了产前检查，采用新法接生了四十二个婴儿。（易德源）
