Prepare Winter Fodder
    Agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Hubei Province are paying attention to increasing the yield of stalks during harvesting, and collecting everything that can be used as feed and forage. This year, the Jiansu Agricultural Cooperative in Xinghua Township, Hong'an County, Hubei Province, prepared 8,000 catties of winter fodder for each cow during the harvest season. This is a photo of cooperative members accumulating winter and spring fodder for their draught cattle.

    准备好过冬饲料
    湖北省各地农业社在收割中，都注意提高秸秆的收获量，凡能充作饲料饲草的都收集起来。今年，湖北省红安县杏花乡建苏农业社在收获季节中，为每条牛准备了过冬草料八千斤。这是社员们在堆聚今冬明春耕牛饲草。
