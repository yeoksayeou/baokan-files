Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 13th: During the high tide of "Great Blooming and Great Contending," the employees of Chongqing Steel Company launched a "Three Goods" competition focused on production plans, with the aims of "Good Quality, Good Safety, and Good Economy." In many workshops, alongside the big-character posters, quick-rhythm poems, and cartoons of the "Great Blooming and Great Contending," were the joyous reports of outstanding production task completions.

During the competition, each workshop put forward specific goals tailored to its own circumstances. The Small Rolling Mill Shop failed to meet its plan for the three months of June, July, and August. In the competition, workers aimed to exceed the target. Addressing problems encountered in production during the previous months, they strived to improve technology on one hand and strengthen production preparation and technical inspection on the other to reduce non-production time. In the two weeks from September 17th to 30th, this workshop continuously set fourteen new steel rolling records. The shop exceeded its production plan for the month by 10%.

The Large Rolling Mill Shop, having relatively normal production, aimed to improve output and quality. They strictly adhered to labor discipline and obeyed production assignments, while conscientiously implementing the post responsibility system and operating procedures to improve production efficiency. As a result, the steel plate produced by this shop averaged one to two tons more per hour than planned, and the qualification rate reached over 99%.

The Chongqing Steel Company Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has now established ten specialized working groups, including those for production management, financial operations, cadre style, and Party-masses relations. These groups will study methods for improvement in various aspects based on the opinions raised by workers during the rectification campaign, in order to encourage workers to continue participating in the rectification with full enthusiasm and to create even greater production achievements.

　　在整风中开展生产竞赛
    重庆钢铁公司各车间都有奋斗目标
    新华社重庆13日电　重庆钢铁公司职工在大鸣大放的高潮中，围绕生产计划开展了“质量好、安全好、节约好”的“三好”竞赛。在许多车间里，一边是大鸣大放的大字报、快板诗和漫画，一边是出色完成生产任务的大红喜报。
    在竞赛中，各个车间针对不同情况提出了具体奋斗目标。小型轧钢车间在6、7、8三个月都没有完成计划，工人们在竞赛中以争取超额完成任务为奋斗目标，针对前几个月生产中的问题，一方面努力改进技术，一方面加强生产准备和技术检查工作，以减少非生产时间。这个车间从9月17日到30日的两个星期中，就连续创造了十四次轧钢新纪录。这个月超额10％完成了生产计划。
    大型轧钢车间因为生产比较正常，就以努力提高产量和质量为竞赛目标。他们一方面严格遵守劳动纪律和服从生产调配，一方面认真执行岗位负责制、操作规程等，以提高生产效率。结果这个车间生产的钢板平均每小时比计划要多一吨到两吨，合格品达到了99％以上。
    中共重庆钢铁公司委员会现在已经成立了生产管理、财务经营、干部作风、党群关系等十个专业工作组，根据工人在整风中提出的意见分别研究各个方面的改进办法，以鼓励工人继续以饱满的热情参加整风和创造更高的生产成就。
