    New Ramming Song

    Mason Master Yu composed a new ramming song. A group of workers sang it while ramming:

    Lift the stone hammer and hit hard,
    Hai yo hei yo!
    Rightists are like mud,
    Hai yo hei yo!
    Our workers are strong,
    Hai yo hei yo!
    If the rightists don't surrender,
    Hai yo hei yo!
    We'll smash them to bits!
    Ke hai yi yo ho hei!

    Comrades asked him why he composed the song. He said, "I'm not happy without singing, I sing it for the rightists to hear!"

    新打夯歌
    瓦工余师傅编了一个新打夯歌，一群夯工一边打一边唱：
    抬起石夯用力打，
    嗨哟嘿哟！
    右派好比烂泥巴，
    嗨哟嘿哟！
    咱们工人力量大，
    嗨哟嘿哟！
    右派如不来投降，
    嗨哟嘿哟！
    咱们打得他粉骨碎渣！
    咳嗨咦哟嗬嘿！
    同志们问他为啥要编歌，他说：“不唱歌来不开心，唱给右派来听听！”
