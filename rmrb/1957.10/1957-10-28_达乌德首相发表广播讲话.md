	The existence of this mutual respect and friendship nurtures the hope of further developing and consolidating the good relations between the two countries, and it has become the best guiding principle for the governments of Afghanistan and China.

	I am very grateful to the Chinese government and people for their friendship and hospitality towards me and my companions. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks.

	The progress we have seen in China demonstrates the talent and effort of the Chinese people. This progress makes us very happy and is worthy of celebration.

	In accordance with the good wishes of the Afghan people, I once again express my personal feelings, congratulating the Chinese people on achieving even greater accomplishments and happiness.

    达乌德首相发表广播讲话
    新华社27日讯　阿富汗王国首相萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德应中央人民广播电台的邀请，在离开北京前夕向中国人民作了广播讲话。中央人民广播电台在27日晚二十点三十分开始的联播节目里播送了广播讲话的录音。达乌德首相广播讲话的全文如下：
    我来到友好的邻邦中国进行友好访问，能够趁此机会向中国人民传达阿富汗人民的友谊的问候，这是一件使我非常高兴的事情。
    这一友谊的问候的由来，就是阿富汗和中国之间一直存在着的友好关系，这种友好的关系标志着两国人民对世界各国和人民之间的友谊这一原则所抱的信心。
    在国际生活中，阿富汗所希望的是她和全世界人民和国家之间的友好关系。在阿富汗人民看来，这种希望是世界各国为了世界和平而珍爱的最崇高的愿望中的本质部分。
    阿富汗遵循着以独立判断和积极思考为基础的传统的中立政策。她已经在实践中证明了它对于维护和平和友好关系的愿望是真诚的。
    我在中国进行友好访问期间，非常高兴地看到了正如阿富汗人民对中国人民一样，中国人民对阿富汗人民抱着同样热烈的友情。
    这种相互间的尊重和友谊的存在，孕育着进一步发展和巩固两国之间的良好关系的希望，并且成了阿富汗和中国政府最好的指导原则。
    我很感激中国政府和人民对我和我的同伴们的友谊和招待。我愿意表示我衷心的谢意。
    我们在中国看到的进步说明了中国人民的才干和努力。这些进步使我们感到非常高兴，是值得庆贺的。
    依照阿富汗人民的良好愿望，我再一次表示我个人的心情，祝贺中国人民获得更大的成就和幸福。
