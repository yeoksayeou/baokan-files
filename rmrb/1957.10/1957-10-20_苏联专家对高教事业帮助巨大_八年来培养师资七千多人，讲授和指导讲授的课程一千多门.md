　　Soviet Experts Greatly Assist Higher Education
　　Eight Years of Training Over 7,000 Teachers, Lecturing and Guiding Over 1,000 Courses

　　(Our News) In recent years, the Soviet government, adapting to the needs of various stages of development in China's higher education, has dispatched a large number of Soviet experts, led by Alshintsev, Fomin, and Lebedev, to help China build socialist higher education.

　　As early as the beginning of the People's Republic of China, when higher education was still in the stage of recovery and consolidation, Soviet experts helped China establish new-type regular universities – Renmin University of China and Harbin Institute of Technology – playing a positive role in promoting teaching reform in universities. They then helped us transform old universities such as Tsinghua University and Peking University into new socialist universities. During the construction of new institutions such as the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology and the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, experts provided comprehensive assistance.

　　Soviet experts play the role of "mother machine tools" in universities. As of the first half of 1957, according to incomplete statistics, experts personally trained 3,070 teachers for advanced studies and 4,215 graduate students, greatly supplementing and improving the faculty of universities. These teachers and graduate students are located in almost all universities across the country and are generally competent in their work. The training of these graduate students, from the formulation of teaching plans, lectures, tutoring, Q&A, visits and internships, examinations and assessments, graduation designs, and graduation theses, was all under the direct guidance of experts. Some graduate students have reached the level of associate doctorate. In addition, experts also held workshops for us to train and improve teachers and educational administrators. In recent years, 37 workshops of various types have been held, with 2,775 participants. Many cadres from factories, enterprises, and government agencies also attended as auditors.

　　In recent years, Soviet experts have lectured on 889 courses for us and guided Chinese teachers in lecturing on 443 courses. As of the end of 1956, experts had completed 629 kinds of lecture notes and teaching materials for us, of which 108 have been published. These courses and teaching materials were either missing or fundamentally weak courses in China's universities. Many professional courses in metallurgy, petroleum, aviation, geology, mining, and forestry are entirely new to us. Experts not only imparted the most advanced scientific knowledge to us without reservation but also guided us in scientific research and achieved good results.

　　Theory divorced from practice and learning not being applied were significant weaknesses of old Chinese education. Establishing laboratories is an essential measure in overcoming this weakness and seeking the integration of theory and practice. In recent years, experts have helped us establish 496 laboratories, 192 data rooms, and 34 practice factories. All the laboratories of Harbin Institute of Technology and other schools were built with the help of experts. In addition, experts personally guided schools in establishing connections with industrial sectors, signing technical contracts with factories and mines, and leading teachers and students to visit and intern at factories, mines, enterprises, and agricultural and water conservancy facilities. They also helped industrial sectors solve many significant problems.

　　Soviet experts have paid great attention to implementing the spirit of socialist principles in all aspects of assisting China's higher education construction. Experts often mentioned that all courses should implement the cultivation of students' dialectical materialist worldview, adhere to the teaching policy of linking theory with practice, adopt new teaching methods, and attach importance to teaching links such as experiments, production internships, graduation designs, and graduation theses, to cultivate experts of our own working class who are suitable for socialist construction. Experts have worked diligently in a series of tasks, such as adjusting departments and faculties, setting up majors, formulating teaching plans and syllabuses, and establishing new teaching organizations and rules and regulations.

　　To better adapt to the growing needs of China's socialist construction, teachers and students in universities across the country will continue to work hard to adhere to the policy of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and combining it with China's reality, and learn more modestly from Soviet experts to further improve and enhance China's higher education work.

　　苏联专家对高教事业帮助巨大
    八年来培养师资七千多人，讲授和指导讲授的课程一千多门
    本报讯  几年来，苏联政府适应我国高等教育各个不同发展阶段的需要，曾派遣以阿尔辛节夫、福民、列别捷夫为首的大批苏联专家来帮助我国建设社会主义的高等教育。
    早在中华人民共和国建国之初，高等教育还处在恢复与整顿阶段，苏联专家就帮助我国创办了新型正规大学——中国人民大学和哈尔滨工业大学，对推动高等学校教学改革起了积极作用；接着帮助我们把清华大学、北京大学等旧大学改变成社会主义的新大学。在北京钢铁工业学院、北京航空学院等新建院校的建校过程中，专家们都给了全面的帮助。
    苏联专家在高等学校是起着“工作母机”的作用的。截至1957年上半年，据不完全统计，专家亲自培养结叶的进修教师有三千零七十人，研究生四千二百一十五人，使高等学校师资得到大量的补充和提高。这些进修教师和研究生几乎遍及全国各高等学校，一般都能胜任工作。这些研究生的培养，从拟定教学计划、讲课、辅导、答疑、参观实习、考试考查、毕业设计和毕业论文等整个教学过程都是在专家的直接指导下进行的。有的研究生已达到副博士水平。此外，专家还为我们举办讲习班，培养提高教师和教育行政干部。几年来，开办各类讲习班三十七个，参加学习的有二千七百七十五人。工厂企业机关干部旁听进修的也不少。
    几年来，苏联专家为我们讲授的课程有八百八十九门，指导中国教师讲授的有四百四十三门。截至1956年底，专家为我们编写完成讲义、教材六百二十九种，其中出版的有一百零八种，这些课程和教材都是我国高等学校的缺门课或基础十分薄弱的课程，像冶金、石油、航空、地质、采矿以及林业等方面有很多专业的全部专业课程对我们来说都是全新的。专家们不仅把最先进的科学知识无保留地传授给我们，还指导我们进行科学研究并已取得良好效果。
    理论脱离实际，学不致用，是旧中国教育的极大弱点。在克服这个弱点，求得理论与实际相结合方面，建立实验室乃是一项重要措施。几年来专家帮助我们建立实验室四百九十六个，资料室一百九十二个，实习工厂三十四个。哈尔滨工业大学等校的全部实验室都是在专家的帮助下建成的。此外，专家还亲自指导学校与产业部门建立联系，和厂矿订立技术合同，带领师生到厂矿企业及农林水利设施的现场去参观实习，同时也帮助产业部门解决了不少重大问题。
    苏联专家在帮助我国高等教育建设的各项工作中，都极注意贯彻社会主义原则的精神。专家们经常提到，在各门课程中要贯彻培养学生辩证唯物主义世界观，坚持理论联系实际的教学方针，采用新的教学方法，重视实验、生产实习、毕业设计和毕业论文等教学环节，以培养适合社会主义建设需要的工人阶级自己的专家。在进行院系调整，设置专业，制定教学计划、教学大纲，建立新的教学组织和规章制度等一系列的工作中，都有着专家们的辛勤劳动。
    为了更加适应我国社会主义建设日益增长的需要，全国高等学校师生将要继续努力坚持学习苏联先进经验并与中国实际相结合的方针，更加虚心地向苏联专家学习，以更进一步改进与提高我国高等教育工作。
