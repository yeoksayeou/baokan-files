Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th: An article published in the American "Stone's Weekly" on October 14th stated that the successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite had shattered Washington's deterrence policy and bankrupted the "Cold War" policy.

Stone said: "The cornerstone of American postwar policy has collapsed overnight. Deterrence is finished; the ring of bases built around the Soviet Union are vulnerable to medium-range missile attacks; from the air force perspective, the Strategic Air Command, along with all its boasting reporters and grim-faced generals, is now in the horse-and-buggy era. These huge, subsonic bombers are not only too slow for new missile defenses, but also too slow for supersonic jet bombers." Stone believes that America's so-called "position of strength" has vanished, but Eisenhower and Dulles are unwilling to face this fact.

Stone also pointed out that, in addition to the Soviet Union's victory in rocket technology, "what is far more serious is our persistent unwillingness to negotiate," which puts the United States in a "situation where it has lost its argument." He said, "The unwillingness to meet with Zhukov is not just a social discourtesy. There is a widespread impression that we are unwilling to seek a way out of the predicament facing humanity, and this stems from a simple fact: the military bureaucracy here fears nothing more than any easing of the situation." He said that because the United States is unwilling to reach a disarmament agreement, "we include our disarmament proposals in packages of unimaginable complexity," and even if the Soviet Union accepts them, the Pentagon has ways to obstruct them.

After deliberately spreading doubts about the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions, Stone said that the American government is preparing "to plunge into an even greater arms race." He pointed out that from all of this "it can be seen that our political leadership is pathetically small."

　　苏联人造卫星星光灿烂
    美国威慑政策宣告完蛋
    “斯通周刊”劝华盛顿放识相些
    据新华社15日讯　纽约消息：美国“斯通周刊”10月14日发表一篇文章说，苏联发射人造卫星成功一事使华盛顿的威慑政策被粉碎了，使“冷战”政策破产了。
    斯通说：“美国战后政策的基石一夜之间就崩溃了。威慑手段已经完蛋；在苏联周围建立的基地圈都容易遭到中程导弹的攻击；从空军方面来说，战略空军司令部连同它的所有吹牛的报人们和面目狰狞的将军们现在是处在马车时代。这些巨大的比音速慢的轰炸机不仅就新式导弹防御来说是太慢了一些，而且对于超音速喷气轰炸机来说也太慢了。”斯通认为，美国的所谓“实力地位”已经化为乌有，而艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯还不愿意正视这一事实。
    斯通还指出，除了苏联在火箭技术方面取得的胜利以外，“要严重得多的是我们坚持不愿意进行谈判”，这会使美国处于“理屈词穷的境地”。他说，“不愿意会见朱可夫的做法不仅是一个社交上的失礼。现在普遍存在这种印象，认为我们不愿意设法谋求一个摆脱人类面临困境的方法，这是由一个简单的事实产生的，即：这里的军事官僚机构害怕的莫过于局势的任何缓和。”他说，由于美国不愿取得裁军协议，所以“我们把我们的裁军建议包括在简直难以想像的复杂的包裹里”，即使苏联接受它，五角大楼也有办法加以阻挠。
    斯通在故意对苏联的和平诚意散布怀疑以后说，美国政府正在准备“投入较前更大的军备竞赛中去”，他指出，从这一切“就可以看出我们的政治领导是可悲地渺小”。
