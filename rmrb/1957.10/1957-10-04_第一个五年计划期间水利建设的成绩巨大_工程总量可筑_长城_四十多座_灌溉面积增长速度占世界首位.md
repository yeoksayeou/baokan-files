The achievements of national water conservancy construction during the First Five-Year Plan exceeded those of many dynasties before liberation. The total volume of earthwork, stonework, and concrete in these water conservancy projects (6.3 billion cubic meters) could build more than forty "Great Walls."

During the five years, many large-scale projects related to river control and flood prevention were constructed nationwide, and farmland irrigation rapidly developed. In five years, the country newly added 210 million mu of paddy fields and irrigated land, almost equal to the total of more than 230 million mu of paddy fields and irrigated land developed in the thousands of years before liberation. The area of paddy fields and irrigated land increased in the eight years since liberation greatly exceeds the total area of paddy fields and irrigated land developed in the thousands of years before liberation.

River control projects during the five years were still primarily focused on the Huai River. The Yangtze River, Yellow River, Pearl River, Hai River, Liao River, Songhua River, and others also saw vigorous efforts in river channel and dike consolidation. Among them, more than 30,000 kilometers of dikes were repaired and reinforced. At the same time, many reservoirs and sluice gates were built nationwide during the five years, and many flood storage and detention projects were constructed using lakes and depressions, significantly improving the flood control capacity of these rivers. The Sanmenxia project for the fundamental control of the Yellow River also commenced this spring.

Before liberation, with the exception of the Fengman Reservoir built by the Japanese and puppet regime on the Songhua River, not a single large reservoir or famous large sluice gate had been built. After liberation, during the first three years of national economic recovery, the state built three large reservoirs—Baisha, Banqiao, and Shimantan—on tributaries of the Huai River, as well as the Runheji and Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project's three large sluice gates. In the past five years, nine large reservoirs, including Boshan, Nanwan, Foziling, Meishan, Xianghongdian, Mozitan, Guanting, Dahuoquan, and Sanmenxia, have been completed or are under construction on some major rivers, along with eight large sluice gates such as the Sanhe Sluice Gate, Dujiatai Flood Diversion Sluice Gate, and Sheyang River Tide Barrier Sluice Gate, and dozens of medium-sized sluice gates.

While harnessing major rivers, the state also invested in constructing many irrigation projects utilizing these rivers to increase farmland irrigation. Among them, there are more than 300 large-scale irrigation projects, such as the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Ji-Wei Project in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the Subei Irrigation Main Canal in the Huai River Basin (which will be able to irrigate more than 20 million mu of farmland), the Baisha Irrigation Canal (China's first project to use water stored in a large reservoir for irrigation), the "August 1st" Victory Canal in Xinjiang, the Beichuan Canal and Dongyuan Canal in Qinghai, and the Luohui Canal in Shaanxi.

In addition, renovations and expansions were carried out on existing irrigation projects such as the Dujiangyan Irrigation System in Sichuan and the Tanglai Canal in Yinchuan, Gansu. In the past five years, irrigation projects constructed and expanded solely with state investment have increased the irrigated area by more than 41 million mu. Together with the tens of millions of mu of irrigated area increased by ponds, dams, wells, canals, and small reservoirs built by the masses themselves, the total irrigated area nationwide has grown from more than 230 million mu before liberation and 310 million mu in 1952 to 520 million mu, equivalent to 30% of the total irrigated area of all countries in the world. China ranks first in the world in terms of both the total irrigated area and the growth rate. Currently, about 30.5% of the country's approximately 1.7 billion mu of cultivated land is paddy fields and irrigated land. The average amount of paddy fields and irrigated land owned by each agricultural worker in the country has also increased from half a mu before liberation to about one mu.

Significant achievements have also been made in drainage, flood control, and soil and water conservation over the past five years. Currently, of the approximately 100 million mu of cultivated land in the country that is prone to flooding, 22.2 million mu can defend against floods that occur once every five years or more. Of the approximately 1.5 million square kilometers of soil erosion area in the country, soil erosion has been initially controlled in nearly one-tenth of the area.

During the First Five-Year Plan, in order to fundamentally control and develop the country's rivers, the state also organized a large number of water conservancy technicians to conduct large-scale surveys, measurements, drilling, research, design, and other work, and began to compile basin plans. Currently, the basin plans for the fundamental control and development of four major rivers—the Yellow River, Huai River, Hai River, and Liao River—and another ninety small and medium-sized rivers have been completed. The basin planning work for three major rivers—the Yangtze River, Pearl River, and Songhua River—and another eighty-seven small and medium-sized rivers is underway. These things have never happened in the history of water conservancy in old China. This work has also prepared for the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan.

    第一个五年计划期间水利建设的成绩巨大
    工程总量可筑“长城”四十多座
    灌溉面积增长速度占世界首位
    新华社2日讯  第一个五年计划期间全国水利建设的成就，超过了解放前的很多朝代。这些水利工程的土方、石方和混凝土的总量（六十三亿公方），可以修筑四十多座“万里长城”。
    五年中，全国修了许多有关治河防洪的大工程，也迅速地发展了农田灌溉的事业。五年全国新增加的水田和水浇地共达二亿一千万亩，几乎与解放前几千年间全国总共发展的二亿三千多万亩水田和水浇地相等；而解放八年来全国增加的水田和水浇地面积，则大大地超过了解放前几千年间全国总共发展的水田和水浇地面积。
    治河大工程五年来仍以治淮为主；长江、黄河、珠江、海河、辽河、松花江等，也大力进行了河道和堤防的整理工作。其中仅修整和加固的堤防就有三万公里以上。同时，五年来全国还兴修了许多水库、水闸，利用湖泊洼地修建了许多蓄洪、滞洪工程，使这些河流的防洪能力有了显著的提高。根治黄河的三门峡工程也在今年春天开工了。
    解放前，除日伪在松花江修的丰满水库外没有修过一个大型水库和著名的大闸。解放后在前三年的国民经济恢复时期国家就在淮河支流上修成了白沙、板桥、石漫滩三个大型水库和润河集、荆江分洪工程的三座大水闸。五年来又在一些大河流上建成和正在修建薄山、南湾、佛子岭、梅山、响洪甸、磨子潭、官厅、大伙房、三门峡等九座大型水库，三河闸、杜家台分洪闸、射阳河挡潮闸等八座大型水闸和几十座中型水闸。
    在治理大江大河的同时，国家还利用这些河流投资兴修了许多灌溉工程增加农田水利。其中，像黄河下游的引黄灌溉济卫工程，淮河流域的将来可以灌溉二千多万亩农田的苏北灌溉总渠，我国第一个引用大型水库蓄水灌溉的白沙灌溉渠，新疆的“八一”胜利渠，青海的北川渠、东原渠，陕西的洛惠渠等大型灌溉工程，就有三百多处。
    另外，还对原有的四川都江堰、甘肃银川唐倈渠等灌溉工程，进行了整修、扩建。五年来，仅国家投资修建和扩建的灌溉工程就增加灌溉面积四千一百多万亩；加上农民群众自己投资兴修数以千万计的塘坝井渠和小型水库所增加的灌溉面积，全国目前的总灌溉面积已由解放前的二亿三千多万亩和1952年的三亿一千万亩发展到五亿二千万亩，相当于世界各国灌溉面积总和的30％。在灌溉面积的总量和增长速度方面，中国已占世界第一位。现在，全国约十七亿亩的耕地中，有30.5％是水田和水浇地；全国每个农业人口平均占有的水田和水浇地，也由解放前的半亩增加到一亩左右。
    在排水除涝和水土保持方面，五年来也取得了显著成就。现在，全国易受洪涝灾害的约一亿亩耕地中，已有二千二百万亩可以防御五年一遇以上的涝灾；全国大约一百五十万平方公里的水土流失面积中，已经有接近十分之一的地区的水土流失被初步控制起来。
    第一个五年计划期间，为了根治和开发全国的河流，国家还组织大批水利技术人员，进行了大规模的勘查、测量、钻探、研究、设计等工作，着手编制流域规划。现在，根治和开发黄河、淮河、海河和辽河等四条大河流的流域规划，和另外九十条中小河流的流域规划已经完成；长江、珠江和松花江等三条大河流和另外八十七条中小河流的流域规划工作，正在进行。这些事情，在旧中国的水利史上也都是从来没有过的。而这些工作，也为第二个五年计划的实施作了准备。
