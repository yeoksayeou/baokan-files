We Must Take Liu Shaotang as a Mirror
Mao Dun

I have already written two short articles about Liu Shaotang's anti-Party words and deeds and his bourgeois individualistic ideological qualities ("The Educational Significance of Liu Shaotang's Experience," China Youth, September issue; "On Writing Realistically and Independent Thinking," China Youth Daily, August 16). There is also an article "How to Avoid Formulaism and Conceptualization?" Literary Studies, September issue, which also refutes the fallacies of Liu Shaotang and other rightists). To save time today, I won't repeat them.

In the article "The Educational Significance of Liu Shaotang's Experience," I said: "Liu Shaotang's anti-Party process, like the main members of the Ding-Chen anti-Party group, Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, Feng Xuefeng, etc., has its basic similarities." This is serious bourgeois individualism (pride and complacency, independence from the Party, feeling that the Party restricts their development, feeling that the Party interferes with their freedom, which of course develops into anti-Party) and bourgeois idealistic literary thought. This article was written a little earlier. Now, after reading more materials exposing Liu Shaotang, I feel that Liu Shaotang has one more characteristic: ignorance (poverty of life experience, literary knowledge, and general cultural knowledge) and arrogance. The saying "not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth" is suitable for him.

He clamors for "independent thinking," as if the Party does not give him independent thinking. The Party encourages independent thinking, but does not allow Liu Shaotang's kind of independent thinking. As soon as he thinks, he goes to the bourgeoisie. This is not independent thinking, but becoming a slave to bourgeois thought. During the period of great contending and blooming, his anti-Party remarks, which he thought came from his "independent thinking," and his remarks slandering socialist literature, I think are really just picking up the leftovers of others, the leftovers of older rightists and international revisionists.

How many Soviet works has he read? Yet he also echoes that the first twenty years of Soviet literature were better than the latter twenty years. How bold! How arrogant! He is young and has written a lot, but it seems he doesn't read much. Since he hasn't read many works, he just echoes, which is a very unrealistic attitude.

He opposes socialist realism. I doubt, has he ever done any research on the theory of realism? How many Chinese and foreign realist writers and works has he studied? Has he read and studied the works of all eras of realism? Has he studied the theory and works of socialist realism? Socialist realism, from Gorky's "Mother" to today, has a history that is not short; in the forty years after the October Revolution, there have been thousands of new literary works in the Soviet Union every year. If you want to criticize socialist realism, you have to honestly read these works! I think he just picked up some fragmented knowledge, but he dared to sentence socialist realism to death! He is very poor in knowledge, and he doesn't understand what realism is at all. "Writing truthfully" cannot replace realism, let alone socialist realism. It is wrong to think that realism is "writing truthfully." "Writing truthfully" is a bourgeois saying, and behind the words "writing truthfully" is not wanting a position, which did not start now, but has a history of more than a hundred years. However, bourgeois artists are not without a position in fact; they have a bourgeois position, but they hypocritically say that they only want to "write truthfully." As for us, because we realize that literature and art are weapons of class struggle, and our task is to fight against bourgeois ideology, we must first raise the question of position. Many young friends think that it is right to advocate "writing truthfully," which is an extremely wrong idea. Developing from this idea ("writing truthfully"), you will come to the conclusion that the Marxist-Leninist worldview is not needed, and ideological remolding is not needed, and such a conclusion is precisely the main point of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. From what angle and from what position to write truthfully? This is the focus of the question. Rightists use "writing truthfully" as a guise to only look for the dark side of society. This is the intention of the rightists to "write truthfully"!

Liu Shaotang is very ignorant on the one hand, and very arrogant on the other. This dishonest and ungrounded style is not what a young author should have. A young person who commits this kind of problem will definitely destroy himself! Holding such a criticism meeting is to point out his root cause and save him.

Liu Shaotang's process of degeneration makes us pay attention to some issues in cultivating young writers.

I know that some young friends start writing a few works that are not bad, become famous and have a sense of complacency, and do not think about accumulating life and improving their ideological level, so they write worse and worse, and finally can't write anything. Others are not proud and complacent, but later feel that the things in their stomach are hollowed out and they can't write. Older people also have this experience. When you can't write at a certain time, you will have bitterness. Liu Shaotang has also had this kind of bitterness. To break through this barrier, you have to take the right path. Liu Shaotang took the wrong path. He doesn't understand that his later things are not as good as before because he has little life experience and his ideological level is not high. He can't see the problem in life. This is the basic reason why he can't write. At this time, Liu Shaotang should improve his Marxist-Leninist ideological level and return to life, return to where he came from. But Liu Shaotang doesn't do this. He thinks that he can't write because the Party's literary policy restricts him and his skills are not good. His erroneous view is bourgeois ideology. The development of this kind of thinking, coupled with selfish individualism, degenerates into a rightist.

Ideological guidance should be more important than technical assistance (technical assistance refers to helping young people revise and publish their works, etc.). Many young people write letters asking for help, always saying that they have life experience and materials, as long as we help him revise the first draft he wrote, but no one or very few people write letters asking for guidance on how to observe and analyze life. Some people have reversed the problem, thinking that the first thing is the problem of writing skills, not the problem of ideological position. Young people rarely seriously think about what kind of mind (outlook on life) must be had to see the most educational new things in life. They are always thinking: with the knack of writing, I can immediately become a great writer. This wrong idea is quite common and must be vigorously corrected. If there is a knack, Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has made the knack clear.

A series of measures should be taken to ensure that our various methods of encouraging young practitioners do not create dependence among young people. Substituting revisions is not a good way and has side effects, which will foster dependence. After a young person writes a work, he hopes to find someone to revise it for him. Pointing out the problems without substituting revisions also causes dissatisfaction among young people, which shows the seriousness of young people's dependence. Young people always use Lu Xun's revision of other people's manuscripts as an example to ask us. But I have only seen Lu Xun change one or two words on other people's original manuscripts, and I have never seen him make major changes, as the young people now require. This is not because Lu Xun is lazy, but because this kind of love turns into harm. Like a carpenter taking on an apprentice, it takes some effort to use a plane. If the master sees that the apprentice is not planning well, he will do it for him, and the apprentice will never learn. Substitution for everything will never improve, and many young people do not understand this.

The practice of letting young writers become professional writers too early must be changed. Promoting young amateur writers to professional writers too early or asking them to go to the editorial department to "improve" makes them detached from life. It makes them prone to pride and complacency. And under the self-sufficiency method of professional writers, it makes them produce crudely. If Liu Shaotang had always been in the countryside and done some work there, he might not have degenerated to this point.

A young writer's situation of not being able to continue after publishing one or two good works is because he is detached from life. But we always think it is because the skills are not up to par. This is a huge misunderstanding. After being detached from life, no matter how good the skills are, you can't write anything.

Looking at flowers while riding a horse, going down for three or four months, does not solve the problem for ordinary writers, and especially does not solve the problem for young writers, because they are young after all, and their foundation (accumulation of life experience) is poor.

The key to cultivating a new generation and expanding the youth in the literary and art team lies in effectively encouraging and supporting amateur writing. Don't take them out of life too early. The more life accumulation, the better the works can be written. Help them start more from the ideological aspect.

From the Liu Shaotang incident, we can see many problems, and the above is only a part of them. I hope young people will take Liu Shaotang as a mirror to look at themselves. Older people should also take Liu Shaotang as a mirror to look at themselves; but we have one more responsibility, which is to improve the methods of cultivating young authors and amateur authors.

### 我们要把刘绍棠当作一面镜子
茅盾

专栏：

　　我们要把刘绍棠当作一面镜子
　　茅盾
    关于刘绍棠的反党言行以及他的资产阶级个人主义的思想品质，我已经写过两篇小文章（“刘绍棠的经历给我们的教育意义”，中国年青九月号；“关于写真实和独立思考”，中国青年报8月16日。还有一篇“公式化、概念化如何避免”？文艺学习九月号，也是驳斥刘绍棠及其他右派分子的谬论的），今天为了节省时间，不再重复。
    在“刘绍棠的经历给我们的教育意义”文中，我说过：“刘绍棠的反党的经过，正如丁、陈反党集团的主要成员丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰等，有其基本类似之处。”这就是严重的资产阶级个人主义（骄傲自满，对党闹独立，觉得党限制了他们的发展，觉得党干涉了他们的自由，这样当然发展到反党）和资产阶级的唯心主义的文艺思想。这篇文章写得早一点，现在看了更多的揭发刘绍棠的材料，我觉得刘绍棠还多一个特点，就是：无知（生活经验、文艺知识、一般文化知识都是很贫乏的）而又狂妄。“不知天高地厚”，这句话对他说是合适的。
    他叫嚷着要“独立思考”，似乎党不给他独立思考；党是鼓励独立思考的，但不容许刘绍棠那样的独立思考，他一思考就到资产阶级那边去了，这不是独立思考，而是做了资产阶级思想的奴隶了。在大鸣大放期间，他自以为出之于他的“独立思考”的反党言论，诬蔑社会主义文艺的言论，我看实在都是拾人牙慧，拾了比他年纪大的右派分子和国际的修正主义者的牙慧。
    他读过多少苏联作品？然而他竟也跟着喊苏联文学前二十年的比后二十年的好。这多么胆大！多么狂妄！他年轻，写得倒不少，看来读书不多。他既然没有看很多作品，就跟着叫，态度很不实事求是。
    他反对社会主义现实主义。我怀疑他，对现实主义理论有过什么研究？研究过多少的中国和外国的现实主义作家和作品？他是否把现实主义的各个时代的作品都看过了研究过了？研究过社会主义现实主义的理论和作品没有？社会主义现实主义从高尔基的“母亲”起，直到今天，历史不算短；十月革命后四十年间，苏联每年新文艺作品有几千。如果要批判社会主义现实主义，老老实实就得把这些作品看过！我想他不过拾来一些零零碎碎的知识，可是他也居然大胆要判决社会主义现实主义的死刑！他知识贫乏得很，究竟现实主义是什么，他也不了解。“写真实”不能代替现实主义，更不必说代替社会主义现实主义了。以为现实主义就是“写真实”，这是错误的。“写真实”是资产阶级的说法，“写真实”这话的背后就是不要立场，这也不是现在开始的，有一百多年历史了。但是资产阶级的文艺家事实上并不是没有立场；他们有的是资产阶级的立场，不过他们口头上却虚伪地说只要“写真实”。我们呢，因为认识到文艺是阶级斗争的武器，而且我们的任务是和资产阶级思想作斗争，所以一定先要提出立场问题。很多年轻朋友以为提“写真实”是应该的，这是极端错误的想法，从这一思想（“写真实”）发展下去，就会得出结论：马列主义世界观是不需要的，思想改造是不需要的，而这样的结论，正是胡风反革命集团主要的论点。从什么角度、什么立场去写真实？这是问题的焦点。右派分子利用“写真实”做幌子，专找社会的黑暗面。这就是右派分子“写真实”的用心所在！
    刘绍棠一方面无知得很，一方面狂妄得很。这种不老实，不踏实的作风，都不是一个青年作者所应有的。一个青年犯了这种毛病，一定要毁灭自己！开这样的批判会，是指出他的病根来，挽救他。
    刘绍棠的堕落过程，让我们注意到培养青年作家的一些问题。
    我知道，有些年轻朋友开始写几篇作品还不错，出了名有了自满之心，就不想法积累生活，提高思想水平，这样就越写越坏，最后写不出东西来。另一些人不骄傲自满，但后来觉得肚里的东西挖空了，写不出了，年纪大一些的也有这种经验。到一定时候写不出来，就有苦闷。刘绍棠也有过这种苦闷，要想突破这一关就得走对路，刘绍棠是走错路了。他不了解他后来的东西不如以前的好，因为生活经验少，思想水平不高，到生活中也看不出问题来。这是写不出来的基本原因。刘绍棠这时应提高马列主义思想水平，应回到生活中去，从哪里来回到哪里去。但刘绍棠不这么做。他以为写不出来是党的文艺政策约束了他，是技巧不好的缘故。他的这种错误观点就是资产阶级思想。这种思想发展下去，加以自私自利的个人主义，就堕落为右派。
    思想的指导应当重于技术上的帮助（技术上的帮助，指帮助青年们修改、发表作品等等），有不少青年写信要求帮助，总是说自己有生活经验，有材料，只要我们帮助他修改他那写出来的初稿，可是从没有或者很少有人写信要求指导他如何观察、分析生活。有人把问题看颠倒了，以为首先是写作技巧问题，而不是思想立场问题。青年们很少认真想一想：必须有怎样的头脑（人生观）方能在生活中看到最有教育意义的新事物。他们却老是在想：有了写作的窍门，我马上就可以成为大作家。这种错误观念，相当普遍，必须大力纠正才好。如有窍门，毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”已把窍门说得明明白白了。
    要采取一系列的措施，使得我们鼓励青年习作者的各项办法不至于造成青年们的依赖思想。代为修改不是好办法，有副作用，会养成依赖性。青年写出作品之后，就希望找到一个人替他改。指出毛病而不代修改，也引起青年们的不满，可见青年们依赖思想之严重。青年老以鲁迅代人修改稿件为例来要求我们。但我只见过鲁迅在别人原稿上改一二字，没有见过他大改，像现在青年们所要求。这不是鲁迅躲懒，而是因为这样爱之反成了害之。和木匠带徒弟一样，使刨子要有点工夫，如果师傅见徒弟刨不好，就代他刨，徒弟永远学不会的。包办代替，永远是提不高的，许多青年不了解这个。
    过早地让青年作家来做专业作家的办法必须改变。把青年的业余写作者过早地提为专业作家或者要他到编辑部去“提高”，使得他们脱离了生活。使得他们容易滋生骄傲自满情绪。而在职业作家自给办法下，又使得他们粗制滥造。刘绍棠如果一直在农村，在那里做一些工作，也许就不会堕落到现在这个地步。
    一个青年作家发表了一二篇好作品后即无以为继的情况，是因为脱离了生活之故。可是我们总自以为是技巧还不到家之故。这是极大的误解。脱离生活之后，技巧再好也写不出东西来。
    走马看花，下去三、四个月，对于一般作家都不解决问题，而对于青年作家尤其不解决问题，因为他们到底年青，底子（生活经验的积累）差。
    培养新一代，扩大文艺队伍中青年分子，其关键在于有效地鼓励和扶植业余写作。不要过早把他们从生活中抽出来，生活积累越多越能写出好作品来。帮助他们多从思想方面着手。
    从刘绍棠事件中，我们可以看到许多问题，上面不过举了一部分。希望青年们把刘绍棠作一面镜子照照自己。我们年纪大一点的，也应把刘绍棠作为一面镜子照照自己；但我们还多一个责任，就是改进培养青年作者和业余作者的方法。
