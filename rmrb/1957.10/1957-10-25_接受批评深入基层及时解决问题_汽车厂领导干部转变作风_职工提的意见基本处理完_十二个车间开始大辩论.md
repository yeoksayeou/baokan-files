    (Our report) The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's rectification and socialist education movement is developing in depth. More than 80,000 suggestions put forward by workers have been initially processed and resolved where possible, basically achieving "each item accounted for, each issue addressed." Other issues that cannot be resolved temporarily are being further investigated and studied, or transferred to higher-level authorities for handling. Issues that need to be clarified and debated have already begun a great debate. Currently, the debate is taking place in twelve workshops, including heat treatment, model making, and machine repair.

    Approximately 40% of the opinions expressed during the airing of views criticize the leadership style. Workers sharply criticized the tendency of leaders at all levels to be out of touch with reality and divorced from the masses. In order to thoroughly solve this problem, in addition to the party organizations at all levels formulating measures to go deep among the masses and change their style, the factory party committee also made a decision: it is necessary to adhere to the implementation of half a day of physical labor per week; establish a two-day "no-meeting day" system within each week, without holding any meetings on these two days, as a way to consolidate the method of leaders maintaining close ties with the masses.

    On the first no-meeting day in October, Factory Director Rao Bin went deep into the workshop to study competition conditions and the cotton yarn pressing machine created by workers. Chi Dezhu, a cyanide worker in the heat treatment workshop, said excitedly after talking with the factory director: "Factory Director Rao talked with me for half an hour, not only about work, but also very concerned about my living conditions." Fang Jie, Deputy Secretary of the Factory Party Committee, also discussed the issue of launching a socialist great debate with workers on this day.

    Leading cadres in various workshops and functional departments, after rectification, have generally begun to go deep into the workshops and grassroots, overcoming the past bureaucratic and aloof style. As a result, many long-standing problems have been resolved. The planning management of the forging workshop used to be relatively chaotic, with improper planning and scheduling, resulting in uneven workloads. Although workers had raised their opinions many times, they were not resolved. The leadership believed that poor planning management in a new factory was difficult to avoid and did not actively study and take measures. This time, after the workers' serious criticism, specifically exposing the losses caused by poor planning such as work stoppages and accidents, the leadership deeply recognized the seriousness of the problem, criticized the past passive sentiments, changed their style, and conducted in-depth research. They also contacted and consulted with departments such as power and production many times, significantly improving the planning management work. In September, the production plan was overfulfilled. Twenty-one out of the twenty-three production teams in the workshop exceeded their production quotas. This is a new phenomenon that did not exist in the past. After the leaders of the tool workshop No. 2 changed their style, they went deep into the grassroots to organize process personnel to solve key production problems such as the production of precision tools. As a result, three extremely precise tools that had not been successfully trial-produced within half a year to a year, such as the lock body die-casting mold, high-speed grinding head, and diamond boring head, were successfully trial-produced. Tool workshop No. 2, which had not fully completed its plan for two quarters, fully completed its plan in September. Now, half of the time of leading cadres in various workshops is spent going deep among the masses to understand the situation and help solve various problems in production, ideology, and life. At present, one hundred and seven technical safety projects are under construction. The gearbox workshop has rearranged the unreasonable machine tool layout, which facilitates worker operation. A soft ladder has also been installed on the crane in the machine repair workshop. The head of the living welfare department led the cooks to visit and learn from the provincial model canteen - Yingcheng Coal Mine Canteen, solving the more urgent problem of improving food management in the living welfare, so that the variety of staple foods in the sixteen canteens reached one hundred and two kinds, and the variety of non-staple foods reached seventy-nine kinds.

    The rectification movement has enlivened the democratic life of the entire factory. Workers have exposed many wasteful phenomena in production caused by the bureaucratic style of the leadership. These wasteful phenomena have been eliminated one by one with the change of leadership style. The material heads of the forging workshop used to be sent to the waste material workshop for disposal as waste products. Now, they are recovered and studied for the use of forging parts. The remaining canvas material heads used by the carpentry workshop for making seat cushions and backrests are also sewn together and used after research. The oil leakage of machine tools in the metal products and die-casting workshops was very serious, resulting in great waste. After the workers criticized this, the metal products workshop specially formed a "machine tool oil leakage research and repair group" to solve it. Now, the oil leakage phenomenon has been basically eliminated.

    In the process of solving problems, many leading cadres went deep down and consulted with workers for research and discussion, and provided persuasion and explanation when necessary. Some workers in the metallurgical laboratory were unwilling to wear aprons and wanted to wear overalls. Chen Yusun, director of the metallurgical department, and Wu Dan, director of the safety technology department, went to the workshop to study with them and learned that their main idea was for beauty. After persuasion, they gave up the idea. Although some extremely small problems were solved in the process of solving problems, the leaders at all levels also paid enough attention to them. For example, problems such as the long queuing time for meals in the model workshop and the establishment of red corners in the collective dormitory were seriously resolved, which made the workers very satisfied and the relationship between the leaders and the masses became closer.

    接受批评深入基层及时解决问题
    汽车厂领导干部转变作风
    职工提的意见基本处理完　十二个车间开始大辩论
    本报讯　第一汽车制造厂整风、社会主义教育运动正在深入开展，职工提出的八万多条意见，能够解决的已经初步处理结束，基本上作到“条条有交代，件件有着落”。其他暂时不能解决的问题，正在继续调查研究，或转请上级机关处理，需要明辨是非的问题，已开始大辩论。目前，辩论正在热处理、模型、机修等十二个车间进行。
    这次鸣放约占40％左右的意见，都是批评领导作风的。工人尖锐的批评了各级领导干部工作不深入、脱离群众的倾向。为了彻底解决这一问题，除了各级党组织制订出深入群众、转变作风的措施外，厂党委并作出决定：必须坚持执行每周半天参加体力劳动；在每周内建立两天无会议日制度，每逢这两天，不开任何会议，作为巩固领导干部密切联系群众的方法。
    在10月份第一个无会日里，厂长饶斌深入车间研究了竞赛条件、职工创造的压棉纱机等问题。热处理车间氰化工迟德珠和厂长谈话后激动地说：“饶厂长和我谈了半个小时的话，不但谈工作，对我的生活情况也很关心。”厂党委副书记方劫也在这天和工人研究了开展社会主义大辩论的问题。
    各车间和职能部门的领导干部，经过整风，普遍开始深入车间，深入基层，克服过去的官僚主义、高高在上的作风。因而，使许多长期没有解决的问题得到解决。锻工车间过去计划管理比较混乱，计划不当，调度不当，忙闲不均，工人虽然提过多次意见也没有得到解决。领导上认为，新建厂计划管理不周是很难避免的，没有积极研究采取措施。这回，经过工人的严肃批评，具体地揭发出计划不周所造成的停工、事故等损失，使领导上深刻认识到问题的严重性，批判了过去的消极情绪，转变作风，深入研究，并且多次和动力、生产等部门联系商量，显著地改进了计划管理工作。9月份超额完成了生产计划，车间二十三个生产班，就有二十一个超过班生产定额。这是过去没有的新气象。工具二车间领导上转变作风后，深入基层组织工艺人员解决制作精密工具等生产上的关键问题，结果，使半年到一年时间内没有试制成功的锁体压铸模、高速磨头、金钢镗头等三种极为精密的工具试制出来。两个季度没有全面完成计划的工具二车间，在9月份全面完成了计划。现在，各个车间的领导干部都有一半时间深入群众了解情况，帮助解决生产、思想和生活上的各种问题。目前，已有一百零七项技术安全工程正在施工。变速箱车间已将不合理的机床排列重新安装，便利了工人操作。机修车间的天车也安装上软梯。生活福利处长带领炊事人员到省模范食堂——营城煤矿食堂参观实习，解决了生活福利上比较迫切的改善伙食管理的问题，使十六个食堂的主食品花样达到一百零二种，副食品花样达到七十九种。
    整风运动使全厂的民主生活活跃起来。工人揭发出许多由于领导的官僚主义作风所造成的生产上的浪费现象。这些浪费现象都随着领导作风的转变一一消除。锻工车间的料头，过去都送到废料车间当作废品处理，现在，重新收回，研究利用锻打零件。木工车间制作坐垫靠背用剩下的帆布料头，经研究也缝接起来加以利用。金属品、冲模车间机床漏油很严重，浪费很大，工人批评后，金属品车间专门组成“机床漏油研究修理小组”，加以解决，现在漏油现象基本消灭。
    在解决问题当中，许多领导干部深入下去和工人商量研究，必要时进行说服解释。冶金处试验室有些工人不愿穿围裙，要穿背带裤，冶金处长陈禹荪、安全技术处长吴丹就下到车间和他们研究，了解到他们的思想主要是为了美观，经过说服，他们不要了。在解决问题当中虽然是些极小的问题，各级领导上也给予足够的重视，如模型车间吃饭排队时间长、集体宿舍开办红角等问题，都认真地给予解决，使工人很满意，领导和群众的关系更加密切了。
