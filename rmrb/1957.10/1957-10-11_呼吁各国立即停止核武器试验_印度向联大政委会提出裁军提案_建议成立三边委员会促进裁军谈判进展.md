Calling on All Countries to Immediately Halt Nuclear Weapons Tests
India Submits Disarmament Proposal to UN Political Committee
Suggests Establishing a Tripartite Committee to Promote Progress in Disarmament Negotiations

Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: The Indian delegation submitted two proposals to the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee on the 9th, calling on all countries to immediately agree to halt nuclear weapons tests.

These two proposals concerning disarmament issues also requested that relevant countries immediately agree to establish a tripartite committee to promote progress in disarmament negotiations. According to Indian representative Lal, the committee could be composed of nine members, with each side representing two opposing opinions sending three members, and the other three members being selected by mutual agreement between the two sides. These three neutral members would seek to reconcile the disarmament negotiations that have reached a stalemate.

The proposal pointed out that the tripartite committee would consider the following issues with reference to the progress already made and submit appropriate recommendations to the Disarmament Commission: (A) The effective date for fissionable materials produced by various countries in the future to be used entirely for peaceful purposes; (B) The issue of not using nuclear and thermonuclear weapons and converting the fissionable materials saved in this way for peaceful purposes; (C) Inspection and supervision arrangements required for the implementation of agreements on conventional armaments in order to generate the necessary trust.

The proposal also suggested the establishment of a purely technical scientific and technological committee. This committee, composed of prominent scientific and technological figures, could make arrangements for inspection and supervision on the issue of effectively halting nuclear tests and submit them to the Disarmament Commission.

    据新华社10日讯　印度代表团9日向联合国大会政治委员会提出两个提案，呼吁各国立即同意停止核武器试验。
    有关裁军问题的这两个提案还要求有关各国立即同意成立一个三边委员会，以促进裁军问题谈判的进展。据印度代表拉尔解释，委员会可以由九人组成，即代表两种相对意见的双方各派三人，另三人由双方协议选出。这三个中立成员将设法调和已经陷入僵局的裁军谈判。
    提案指出，三边委员会将参考已经取得的进展考虑下述问题并向裁军委员会提出适当的建议：（甲）关于今后各国生产的裂变物资应完全供和平目的之用的有效日期；（乙）关于不使用核和热核武器以及将这样省下的裂变物改用于和平目的的问题；（丙）关于实行有关常规军备的协议以便产生必要的信任所需要的视察和监督安排。
    提案又建议成立一个纯粹是技术性的科学技术委员会。这个委员会由著名的科学技术人士组成，它可就有效地停止核试验问题作出视察和监督的安排，并向裁军委员会提出。
