Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Washington dispatch: NATO Secretary-General Spaak said on the 25th that the North Atlantic Group Council will discuss early next week the issue of holding the group's highest-level meeting in December.

The news stated that it was agreed during the Anglo-American Washington talks that Eisenhower and Macmillan would attend the meeting.

Western news agencies believe that the reason for holding such a high-level meeting is due to the Soviet Union's tremendous leaps forward in artificial satellites, intercontinental missiles, etc., which have caused serious shock and anxiety in Western countries. An Associated Press report stated that Britain and the United States, during the Washington talks, had in fact frankly admitted that the Soviet Union's progress in all aspects had rendered the West's original policies "obsolete."

A Washington official said that recent Soviet scientific developments have almost destroyed the assumptions on which Western strategy is based.

The United States urgently needs to boost the morale of its allies at the highest-level meeting of the North Atlantic Group. The news stated that the United States wants to ensure at the meeting that its allies are not afraid of "terrible retaliation" and continue to follow the United States in the nuclear arms race. It is said that the United States will propose a "New Look policy" that requires the entire Western world to "form a big family in atomic rocket power" and to accelerate the modernization of the North Atlantic Group's armed forces. There are reports that, with central control maintained in Washington, the United States will "share rocket and atomic nuclear expertise and weapons" with its allies under different conditions and will separately provide Western countries with the most modern weapons, including missiles. The United States currently wants to rely on these things to "instill new confidence" and "new impetus" into the "free world."

    北大西洋集团筹开最高级会议
    美国想给各“盟国”打气
    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：北大西洋集团秘书长斯巴克25日说，北大西洋集团理事会将在下星期初讨论在12月举行这个集团的最高级会议的问题。
    消息说，英美华盛顿会谈中商定，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦将出席这次会议。
    西方通讯社认为，所以要举行这样最高级的会议是由于苏联在人造卫星、洲际导弹等等方面的巨大跃进，在西方国家中引起了严重的震惊和不安。美联社消息说，英国和美国在华盛顿会谈中实际上已经非常坦白承认，苏联在各方面的进步已经使得西方原来的政策“过时了”。
    华盛顿一个官员说，最近苏联科学上的发展几乎已经摧毁了西方战略所根据的假定。
    美国急需在北大西洋集团最高级会议上来给盟国打气。消息说，美国要在会议上使盟国不要害怕“可怕的报复”，而继续跟随美国进行核军备竞赛。据说，美国要提出一项“新面貌政策”，这种政策要求整个西方世界“在原子火箭威力上结成一个大家庭”，要加速北大西洋集团军队的现代化。有消息说，在华盛顿保持中心控制权情况下，美国将在不同条件下同盟国“分享火箭和原子核专门知识和武器”，将有分别地给予西方国家以包括导弹在内的最现代化武器。美国目前就想依靠这些东西来对“自由世界灌输新的信心”、“新的动力”。
