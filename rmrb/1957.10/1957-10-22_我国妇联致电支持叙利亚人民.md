Xinhua News Agency, October 21st. The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China today sent a telegram to Mrs. Joselli, President of the Syrian Women's Federation, and forwarded it to all Syrian women, expressing firm support for the Syrian people's just struggle to defend their national independence and resist aggression.

The telegram said, "Ignoring the condemnation and warnings of world public opinion, U.S. imperialism continues to intensify its efforts to drive Turkey to carry out armed provocations against Syria, attempting to launch a war of aggression and threatening peace in the Middle East and the world. Chinese women feel boundless anger.

We firmly support the heroic and just struggle of Syrian women and the people to safeguard Syrian independence and defend world peace, and extend our highest respect to all Syrian sisters.

Your struggle has the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, and we believe that you will surely achieve victory."
