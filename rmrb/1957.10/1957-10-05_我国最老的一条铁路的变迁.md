	Before National Day, we made a visit to China's oldest existing railway line. This railway is the Tianjin-Shanhaiguan Railway. Construction began in 1879 (the fifth year of the Guangxu reign in the Qing Dynasty). The earliest section was the Tangshan to Xugezhuang section (note). Perhaps readers will find it strange that it initially used mules and horses as locomotives to haul goods; now, it has become a railway with the latest technological equipment in the world.

	As early as 1877, Li Hongzhang recruited merchants to establish the Kaiping Coal Mine in Tangshan. To transport coal to Tianjin quickly, a little over nine-kilometer-long Tangxu Railway was built two years later to connect the coal-carrying river at the time. Initially, there were no locomotives, so many mules pulled several small wooden open cars on the track, moving slightly faster than ox carts. The following year, an old waste boiler from a mining machine was modified into a small locomotive for traction, which greatly shocked the Qing court, who said it "shook the imperial tombs" (the Qing imperial tombs were near Tangshan). After several memorials to the throne, its use was permitted. Later, the Tangxu Railway gradually extended to both ends. Fourteen years later, it connected Tianjin to Shanhaiguan. However, for sixty to seventy years, this railway remained at a backward technological level.

	The Jinshan Line is the only railway transportation artery inside and outside the passes. Millions of tons of materials supporting the Northeast and the Northeast supporting national construction are mostly transported through it. Due to particularly heavy traffic, the state made it a key project for technical transformation during the First Five-Year Plan.

	We first arrived at the oldest station on this ancient railway, the Tangshan Old Station. According to an old railway worker, everything has changed here over the decades, except for the ticket office with its purplish-red iron sheet roof, which still maintains its original appearance. From the outside, one can still faintly make out several dark windows where tickets were sold at the time. However, not far in front of it, the latest railway technology attracted our interest. That is the automatic block signaling device that has recently been installed. At this time, a train was coming from the east, traveling on a "green street" of safe passage opened for it by the automatic block signal. A signal behind the train has automatically changed from green to red, prohibiting subsequent trains from passing, and due to a wonderful electrical interlocking reaction, another signal further behind has also automatically changed from red to yellow, calling for subsequent trains to slow down. In the current duty station master's office at Tangshan Station, we visited the control panel of the automatic block signaling device. All the station's tracks and parked vehicles are clearly displayed on the illuminated panel. When a train approaches the station from a neighboring station, the red light on the panel begins to glow and the bell rings incessantly, making it very precise and convenient for the duty officer to dispatch trains. To date, this automatic device has been officially used on the 100-kilometer railway line from Beitang to Guye, including the oldest Tangxu section, and is now being extended and erected towards both ends. It is expected that by the end of this year, the entire line from the largest industrial and commercial city in the north, Tianjin, to the "First Pass Under Heaven" of the ancient Great Wall, Shanhaiguan, can be fully installed.

	At Kaiping Station, not far east of Tangshan, we saw another automated equipment – electric switch operation. The duty officer flipped a button, and the heavy manganese steel switch was thrown in two or three seconds. In the past, there were switch houses specially set up at both ends of the station, where fifteen workers worked in shifts, but now they have been abandoned. Mo Yaolin, an old switch operator with more than 20 years of experience, used to think he would be throwing switches for the rest of his life, but he never expected that such ingenious machines would appear only a few years after liberation. He told us that in the past, the switches were very heavy to throw, and sometimes two people couldn't even move them. The station had to throw hundreds of switches every day, and every time a switch was thrown, the switch house had to make several phone calls to the duty station master's office, which is no longer necessary now. In the past, switch operators were very hard-working and had to stay there in strong winds and heavy snow. Now, the duty officer is like working in an office.

	In Guye, we visited the locomotive depot and saw the domestically produced new locomotives. The section chief reminded us to pay attention to the fact that all the new locomotives here are numbered above 2000, and they are all domestically produced. Those foreign locomotives with numbers below 2000 are now rare. Before liberation, this place, like other parts of China, used either British and American locomotives or Japanese locomotives, but there was no Chinese goods. On September 25th, they also drove back a new type of domestically produced "ㄇㄎ--" locomotive from the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory. Many of its operations are automated, equipped with automatic coal feeders, automatic lubricators, and "Trofiimov" type piston valves that reduce resistance and prolong coasting. Its boiler has a large evaporation capacity and high steam heat, so its tractive power is more than a quarter higher than that of old locomotives. The start of these locomotives with the newest technology on this railway made us think of the No. 0 locomotive, known as the "ancestor of locomotives," which we had just visited in Tangshan. It is the sister vehicle of the locomotive that was accused of "shaking the imperial tombs" back then. It looks like a small road roller, with a traction capacity of only 24 tons and a very simple structure, with a thin and long chimney that makes people laugh sticking up in front.

	At the Tianjin hub, one of the largest railway hubs in the country, we visited its main station, Tianjin Station. The entire station yard is like a huge spider web, filled with countless marshalling lines, arrival and departure lines, and dedicated lines. The marshalling yard here originally had only nine tracks, which people still call "Xia Jiugu" (Lower Nine Tracks), but now it has been increased to twenty-six tracks. According to reports, due to the rapid increase in transportation volume, the tracks here are still not enough, and two new marshalling yards with a total of twenty-eight tracks have been built in the wasteland of Tianjin Nancang. At the busy Tianjin Station, radio dispatch telephones have now been partially used to direct the operations of shunting locomotives in operation.

	Zheng Daoyuan, deputy chief engineer of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, and others introduced to us the construction and technical transformation of the Jinshan line. They said: This line has now become one of the famous double-track railways in the country. The construction of the double track began in 1930, but it was never completed in the nineteen years before liberation. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang not only did not repair it but also dismantled a section of the double track. However, by the fourth year after liberation, the double track was completely repaired. By the beginning of this year, all the tracks of this double-track railway had been replaced with extra-heavy 50-kilogram steel rails instead of ordinary 30-40-kilogram steel rails per meter. The density of sleepers has increased from about 1,400 per kilometer before liberation to 1,840, and the ballast on the roadbed is three times thicker than before liberation. A mechanized track maintenance engineering team has also been established, using new electric tamping machines, as well as electric drills, electric chain saws, and other machines to ensure the good quality of the line.

	Due to the implementation of modernized technical transformations, reforms in production organization, and the mobilization of the enthusiasm of workers and other factors, the Jinshan Railway, which has a very high freight density, has adapted to the needs of the country's First Five-Year Plan construction. Its transport volume is increasing year by year. The freight ton-kilometers completed in 1956 increased by 1.46 times compared with 1952, the year before the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, and increased by 7.7% in the first eight months of this year compared with the same period last year. During the Kuomintang and Japanese puppet rule, the line could only pass a maximum of more than twenty pairs of trains per day and night, but now it has been increased to sixty or seventy pairs. All old railway employees believe that such progress and achievements are very unusual.

	(Note): Before the Tangxu Railway was built, two small railways had been built outside Xuanwumen in Beijing in 1865 and between Wusong and Shanghai in 1876, but they were regarded as "monsters" by the Qing court and were demolished one after another.

    我国最老的一条铁路的变迁
    新华社记者　尹崇敬、蒋先凡
    国庆节前，我们在我国现存的最老的一条铁路线上作了一次访问。这条铁路就是天津—山海关铁路。它开始建于1879年（清光绪五年），其中最早的一段，是唐山至胥各庄段（注）。也许读者会感到奇怪的吧，它开始时还是用骡马当机车来拖运货物的呢；而现在却已经成为拥有世界上最新技术设备的铁路了。
    远在1877年，李鸿章招商股在唐山创办了开平煤矿，为了把煤迅速运到天津来，在两年以后就建了一条只有九公里多长的唐胥铁路，以接通当时的运煤河。最初，没有机车，就用好多匹骡马拉着几节小型的木敞车在轨道上行驶，速度比牛车略快。第二年用一只开矿机器的旧废锅炉改制成小火车头牵引，清廷大为震惊，说它“震动皇陵”（清帝陵墓在唐山附近），几经奏本，才准使用。以后，唐胥铁路逐渐向两头延伸，十四年后从天津通到了山海关。但六、七十年间，这条铁路始终停留在落后的技术水平上。
    津山线是关内外唯一的铁路交通孔道。全国支援东北和东北支援全国建设的数以百万吨计的物资，绝大部分是通过它运送的。由于运输特别繁忙，国家在第一个五年计划中，把它作为一个重点进行了技术改造。
    我们首先来到这段古老铁路上最古老的一座车站——唐山老站。据一位老铁路工人解释，这里经过了数十年的变迁，什么都改变了，只有那座紫红色铁皮房顶的票房，还保持着原来的面貌，从它的外面还依稀辨认得出几个当时卖票的暗黑的窗口。但是，就在它前面不远处，一种最新的铁路技术设备把我们的兴趣吸引过去了。那就是新近装成的自动闭塞行车信号装置。这时候一列火车正从东面开来，行驶在自动闭塞信号机为它开辟的一条安全通行的“绿街”上。车后的一架信号机已经自动地由绿色变成红色，禁止后面列车通行，并且由于奇妙的电气连锁反应，再后面另一信号机也自动由红色变成黄色，招呼后面的列车慢行。在现在的唐山车站值班站长室里，我们参观了自动闭塞行车信号装置的操纵台，全站的股道和停靠的车辆都一目了然地显示在这里的照明盘上。当火车从邻站开来接近车站时，盘上的红灯就开始发亮，铃声叮当不绝，值班员调度列车非常精确、简便。到目前为止，包括最古老的唐胥段在内的北塘到古冶间一百公里铁路线上，已经正式使用这种自动装置，现在正在向两头延伸架设，预计到今年年底，从北方最大的工商业城市——天津到古老长城的“天下第一关”——山海关的全线，就可以全部装成。
    在唐山以东不远的开平车站，我们看到了另一个自动化设备——电气操纵道岔。值班员在那里用手指一拨电钮，沉重的锰钢道岔在两、三秒钟内就扳好了。过去在车站两头专设的有十五个工人轮流作业的扳道房，现在已经废弃不用了。已经有二十多年工龄的老扳道工莫耀林从前认为自己要扳一辈子道岔子的，没想到解放才几年就出现了这样巧妙的机器。他告诉我们，过去道岔扳起来很沉，有时两个人还扳不动，站上每天要扳几百次道岔，每扳一次，扳道房就要和值班站长室通上好几个电话，现在都用不着了。过去扳道工非常辛苦，大风大雪都要守在那里，现在值班员就像坐在办公室里办公一样了。
    在古冶，我们访问了这里的机务段，参观了国产的新机车。段长提醒我们，注意看这里所有新机车上的编号都是二千号以上，它们都是国产的，那些编号在二千以下的外国火车头已经很少了，而解放前这里跟我国其他地方一样，不是用的英美车头，就是用的日本车头，反正没有中国货。9月25日，这里还从长辛店机车车辆修理厂开回了一辆新型国产“冖ㄎ——”型机车，它的许多操作都自动化了，装置着自动加煤机，自动注油器和减少阻力延长惰行的“特洛菲莫夫”式汽塞阀，它的锅炉蒸发量大，蒸汽热度高，因而牵引力比旧式机车高四分之一以上。这种经过最新技术改造的机车开始在这条铁路上行驶，使我们想起了刚在唐山参观过的那台被称为“车头祖宗”的○号机车。它就是当年被指控“震动皇陵”的机车的姐妹车，样子就如一台小型压路机，牵引量仅二十四吨，构造非常简单，前面还耸起一个又细又长使人好笑的烟筒。
    在全国最大的铁路枢纽之一的天津枢纽，我们参观了它的主要车站——天津站。整个站场像个庞大的蛛网，布满了数不清的调车线，到发线和专用线，这里的调车场原来只有九条股道，至今人们还称它“下九股”，现在已经增加到二十六股。据介绍，由于运量增长很快，这里股道仍不够用，在天津南仓的荒地上又修建了两个共拥有二十八股道的新调车场。在繁忙的天津站，现在已经开始部分使用无线电调度电话，指挥运行中的调车机车的作业。
    天津铁路分局副总工程师郑道源等人向我们介绍了津山全线线路方面的建设和技术改造的情况。他们说：这条线路现在已经成为国内著名的双轨铁路之一。它是从1930年就开始修建复线的，但解放前的十九年间始终没有建成。抗战胜利以后国民党不但不修，反而拆掉了一段复线。可是，到解放后的第四年，复线就完全修通了。到今年初为止，这条双轨铁路全部轨道又把每公尺三、四十公斤的普通钢轨换成了五十公斤的特重钢轨。枕木的密度由解放前的每公里一千四百根左右增加到一千八百四十根，路基上的石碴也比解放前加厚三倍。现在还建立了一个机械化养路工程队，使用新式的电动捣固机以及电钻、电链锯等机具，保证线路质量的良好。
    由于实行了现代化的技术改造以及生产组织的改革、职工劳动积极性的发挥等各种因素，使得这条货运密度非常高的津山铁路适应了国家第一个五年计划建设的需要。它的运量逐年上升着。1956年完成的货运吨公里比五年计划实施前一年——1952年增加了一点四六倍，今年前八个月比去年同期又增加了7.7％。在国民党和日伪统治时期，这条线路上每昼夜最多只能通过二十多对列车，现在已经提高到六、七十对。所有老铁路员工都认为，这样的进步和成就是很不寻常的。
    （注）：在唐胥铁路筑成前，1865年和1876年已经在北京宣武门外和吴淞—上海间建成两条小铁路，但被清廷视为“怪物”，都先后拆毁了。
