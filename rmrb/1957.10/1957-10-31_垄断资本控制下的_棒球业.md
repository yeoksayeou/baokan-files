The "Baseball Industry" Controlled by Monopoly Capital

    Baseball is originally a sports activity that builds physical strength, enhances health, and cultivates qualities such as wit, courage, and cooperation. However, in the United States, baseball has become a big business for making money, under the tight control of monopoly organizations. Recently, with the widespread phenomenon of inflation and market shrinkage in the United States, the "baseball industry" manipulated by monopoly organizations has become increasingly sluggish.

          “A Unique Business”

    The managers of the American "baseball industry" flatly deny the commercialization of American baseball. However, as early as 1922, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that American baseball is a "unique business." The so-called "unique" means that it is not subject to anti-trust laws, and the managers of the "baseball industry" can obtain excessive profits.

      Two Huge Monopoly Organizations

    National baseball games in the United States are completely controlled by two monopoly organizations: the "American Baseball League" and the "National Baseball League." The "American Baseball League" has eight teams representing Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington. The "National Baseball League" includes eight teams from Boston, Brooklyn, Chicago, Cincinnati, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis. Judging from the sixteen teams owned by these two monopoly organizations, no baseball team west of the Missouri River participates in national competitions, while the two monopoly organizations each have teams from Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and Boston.

    Baseball is still an important sport in American schools. In general American cities, there are also organizations of so-called amateur baseball clubs. But they pale in comparison to the diverse and large-scale professional baseball teams. And the two monopoly organizations, like octopuses, tightly control the "baseball industry" with their tentacles - the "minor leagues" scattered everywhere.

    Cruel Exploitation

    In the eyes of the managers of the "baseball industry," baseball players are nothing more than their money-making tools. They can arbitrarily control the bodies and souls of baseball players. Although the "baseball industry" has been deteriorating in recent years, the total revenue of the sixteen major teams nationwide still approaches $40 million annually. Except for the baseball stars who receive a small reward from the managers, the vast majority of professional baseball players suffer cruel exploitation, and are discarded by the managers once they are over thirty-two years old. Recently, the American "New York Post" published six dispatches under the title "Baseball Slum," reporting the tragic experience of a minor league baseball player. This baseball player loved baseball when he was a student. After graduation, he was deceived into joining a minor league team, suffered the exploitation of the manager, wandered around, and finally withdrew from the "baseball industry" after thirteen years of struggle. He said: "Every player's mind is constantly troubled by the question: what to do after the age of thirty-two?" "A team member's career is always very dangerous. Generally speaking, he must earn money while he can still earn money. An injury, an unexpected event, can ruin his career." (Lè Shān)

### 垄断资本控制下的“棒球业”

    垄断资本控制下的“棒球业”
    棒球本来是一种锻炼身体、增进健康、培养机智、勇敢和合作等优良品质的体育运动。可是在美国，棒球运动却变成了一种赚钱的大生意，受着垄断组织严密的控制。近来随着美国通货膨胀、市场萎缩的普遍现象，垄断组织操纵下的“棒球业”也愈来愈不景气了。
          “独特的商业”
    美国“棒球业”的经理人矢口否认美国棒球运动的商业化。可是早在1922年，美国最高法院就曾经宣布，美国的棒球运动是一种“独特的商业”。所谓“独特的”，就是指它不受反托辣斯法案的约束，“棒球业”的经理人可以获取超额的利润。
      两个庞大的垄断组织
    美国全国性棒球比赛完全控制在“美国棒球联盟”与“全国棒球联盟”这两个垄断组织手中。“美国棒球联盟”拥有波士顿、芝加哥、克利夫兰、底特律、纽约、费拉特尔费亚、巴尔的摩、华盛顿八个代表队。“全国棒球联盟”包括有波士顿、布鲁克林、芝加哥、辛辛那提、纽约、费拉特尔费亚、匹兹堡、圣路易八个代表队。从这两个垄断组织所拥有的十六个队看来，美国密苏里河以西各州竟没有一个棒球代表队参加全国性的比赛，而两个垄断组织却各有一个芝加哥、纽约、费拉特尔费亚、波士顿的代表队。
    棒球在美国学校里仍然是一项重要的运动。在美国一般城市里也有所谓业余的棒球俱乐部的组织。但是它们与五花八门、声势浩大的职业棒球队比较起来，相形见绌。而两个垄断组织就像章鱼一样，凭借着它们的触角——散布在各地的“小联盟”，紧紧地把“棒球业”控制起来。
    残酷的剥削
    在“棒球业”经理人的眼光中，棒球运动员不过是他们的摇钱树而已。他们可以任意支配棒球运动员的身体与灵魂。尽管最近几年以来“棒球业”每况愈下，可是全国十六个主要球队的总收入每年仍旧接近四千万美元。除了棒球名手获得经理人赏赐的一点蝇头小利以外，绝大多数的职业棒球运动员遭受着残酷的剥削，一旦超过了三十二岁，就被经理人置之不顾。最近，美国“纽约邮报”以“棒球贫民窟”为题，发表了六篇电讯，报道一个二流棒球队队员的悲惨遭遇。这一位棒球运动员在做学生的时候，嗜球如命。毕业以后被骗参加了一个二流棒球队，受尽了经理人的剥削，颠沛流离，经过十三年的挣扎，终于退出了“棒球业”。他说：“在每一个球员的脑子里都经常为这个问题所扰：在三十二岁左右以后去作什么事呢？”“一个球队队员的事业始终是很危险的。一般说，他必须在还能够赚钱的时候赚点钱。一次受伤，一次意想不到的事件，就会断送了他的事业。”（乐山）
