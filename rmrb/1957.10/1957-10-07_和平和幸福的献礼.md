    A Gift of Peace and Happiness
    Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Following the successful manufacture of intercontinental missiles, the Soviet Union has successfully launched its first artificial satellite. This is a great gift from Soviet scientists to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. It is also of great significance for safeguarding world peace and promoting human happiness.

    In the mere forty years since the October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet Union's achievements in science and technology have clearly demonstrated that it stands at the forefront of world science. These facts fully illustrate the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

    Someone once asked, where is the advanced level of world science? Those who asked this question should at least understand where it is today.

    We all know that the United States government is also working day and night to encourage American scientists to manufacture intercontinental missiles and artificial satellites, and before they have succeeded, they often boast in front of people. The facts show that American intercontinental missiles have failed many times in testing. Now, the Soviet Union has launched the first artificial satellite.

    The American madmen love to boast that they are "number one in the world" in everything. In the fact that they manufacture atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons to massacre a large number of people, they are truly worthy of being number one in the world. But in the manufacture of intercontinental missiles and artificial satellites, they dare not boast about being "number one in the world" today, no matter what.

    I believe that the success of the Soviet Union in manufacturing intercontinental missiles and artificial satellites is a sedative, especially for American warmongers. Now is the time for them to wake up. It is time for their war frenzy to dissipate.

    Of course, the people of the world, together with the people of the Soviet Union, feel欢欣鼓舞 (rejoicing and excitement). The people of the world all congratulate the great achievements of Soviet scientists; all congratulate the reliable guarantee of world peace and human happiness.

    In particular, the Chinese people and scientists feel extremely excited and grateful. Through these great achievements of Soviet scientists, we clearly recognize the advanced nature of Soviet science and technology; we also clearly recognize the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Without the socialist system's love for science, and without the leadership and supervision of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet scientific and technological community could not have achieved such rapid and brilliant development.

    These great achievements of Soviet scientists are also a powerful spur to our Chinese scientists. We must resolutely support the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely support the superior socialist system, strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and carry out creative and close cooperation with Soviet scientists so that our Chinese scientific cause can also achieve rapid development.

    At present, in particular, we must ruthlessly refute the fallacies of bourgeois right-wingers, purify our scientific ranks, rectify our own style, and improve our political and ideological level, so that we can be confident that in about twelve years, Chinese science will approach the advanced level of the world.

    "When you see a worthy person, think of equalling him," we hope that Chinese scientists will exert all their potential and learn from Soviet scientists!

    和平和幸福的献礼
    中国科学院院长　郭沫若
    苏联在制造成功洲际导弹以后，又成功地射出了第一个人造卫星，这是苏联科学家纪念伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的很好的礼品。它对保卫世界和平、促进人类幸福，也具有十分伟大的意义。
    十月社会主义革命以来，仅仅四十年功夫，苏联科学技术上的成就，已经明显地表明是站在世界科学的最前列，这些事实充分说明了苏联共产党领导的正确性和社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    曾经有人这样问，世界科学先进水平在那里？问这话的人，至少今天应该明白它是在那里了。
    我们都知道，美国政府也在日夜策动美国的科学家制造洲际导弹和人造卫星，而且在没有制造成功以前，还经常在人们面前进行种种吹嘘。事实表明，美国洲际导弹经过多次试验都未成功。现在，人造卫星又是苏联射出了第一个。
    美国的狂人们最爱夸称自己什么都是“世界第一”。他们在制造原子武器、氢武器屠杀大量人民这个事实上，倒真不愧为世界第一。但在制造洲际导弹和人造卫星上，今天无论怎样是不敢再夸什么“世界第一”的大口了。
    苏联制造洲际导弹和人造卫星的成功，我认为，对美国好战分子特别是一服又一服的镇静剂。现在应该是他们清醒一下的时候了。他们战争狂梦应该是烟消云散的时候了。
    当然，全世界人民和苏联人民在一道，是感到欢欣鼓舞的。全世界人民都庆贺苏联科学家的伟大成就；都庆贺世界和平和人类幸福得到了可靠的保障。
    特别是我们中国人民和科学家们，尤其感到无比的兴奋和感谢。我们通过苏联科学家这些伟大的成就，明确地认识了苏联科学技术的先进性；也明确地认识了社会主义制度的无比优越性。如果没有社会主义制度对科学事业的爱护，没有苏联共产党的领导和监督，苏联的科学技术界不可能有这样迅速的、光辉的发展。
    苏联科学家们的这些伟大成就，对我们中国科学家来说，也是有力的鞭策。我们一定要坚决地拥护中国共产党的领导，坚决地拥护优越的社会主义制度，努力学习苏联的先进经验，和苏联科学家进行创造性的密切合作，使我们中国的科学事业也能得到迅速的发展。
    在目前来说，我们特别要毫不容情地反驳资产阶级右派分子的谬论，纯洁我们的科学队伍，整顿我们自己的作风，提高我们的政治思想水平，我们才能有把握地在十二年左右使中国科学接近世界的先进水平。
    “见贤思齐”，我们希望中国的科学家们发挥一切的潜在力量，向苏联科学家看齐！
