According to the Tianjin Daily: The staff and workers of the Tianjin Municipal State-owned Industrial and Transportation System have achieved great results in carrying out the production increase and economy movement. By the end of September, the original annual production increase and economy plan of 75 million yuan had been overfulfilled. It is estimated that by the end of the year, a total of 115 million yuan can be increased and saved.

This year, the production increase and economy movement of the state-owned industrial and transportation system was carried out under the difficult circumstances of insufficient raw materials and insufficient tasks. At the beginning of the year, it was estimated that about half of the units in the entire system would reduce or limit production. Later, factories and enterprises repeatedly educated employees on the importance of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, launched three consecutive upsurges of competition, actively sought external work, trial-produced new products, opened up sources of raw materials, utilized and recycled waste materials, and tried every possible means to solve the difficulties of raw material shortages and insufficient tasks. Hundreds of major measures were implemented, which greatly alleviated the difficulties of raw material shortages and insufficient tasks. Now, except for a few factories where tasks are still insufficient due to special reasons, the production of most units in the fourth quarter is not a problem, and many units can even increase production compared to last year. For example, state-owned cotton mills saved a total of 374,000 jin of raw cotton and more than 10,000 jin of cotton yarn in the first half of the year due to the active conservation of raw materials by employees. In addition, measures such as cotton and linen blending, the utilization of waste cotton, and the procurement of some processing tasks were adopted. After the new cotton was put on the market, the supply situation improved, and from September, the equipment that had been shut down at the beginning of the year has been put into operation one after another. The fourth quarter can be carried out with full normal production.

In July and August, various units inspected and summarized the production increase and economy movement, and employees put forward many suggestions and measures to strive for even greater overfulfillment of the production increase and economy plan. According to incomplete statistics from 29 units, 577 new major measures were proposed in August and September, increasing the original production increase and economy plan by 40 million yuan. In particular, since the launch of the rectification movement in mid-September, the leadership has made appropriate arrangements for production, and the employees' enthusiasm for production has been high, achieving "rectification and production without neglecting either," and the completion of the plan has been very good. According to statistics from 43 factories, the total output value completed in September was 115.98%, an increase of 14.67% compared to August. Among the 14 production indicators of the railway system, except for the number of passengers sent, which completed 95% of the plan in September, the other 13 indicators were completed or overfulfilled.

    天津国营企业完成增产节约计划
    九个月增产节约七千五百多万元。九月份生产计划完成的更好，做到了整风生产两不误。
    据天津日报讯　天津市国营工业交通系统职工开展增产节约运动取得很大成绩。到9月底，原订七千五百万元的全年增产节约计划已经超额完成，预计到年底共可增产节约一亿一千五百万元。
    今年国营工业交通系统的增产节约运动是在原料不足、任务不足的困难情况下开展起来的。全系统年初预计减产或限产的单位约占一半以上。后来，各工厂企业反复向职工进行勤俭办企业的教育，连续掀起了三个竞赛高潮，多方兜揽外活，试制新产品，开辟原料来源，利用和回收废料，千方百计地想办法，实现了几百件重大措施，大大缓和了原料缺乏、任务不足的困难。现在除少数工厂因特殊原因，任务仍感不足外，绝大多数单位第四季度的生产不成问题，有不少单位还可以比去年增产。如国营棉纺各厂由于职工积极节约原料上半年共节约原棉三十七万四千多斤，节约棉纱一万多斤，加上采取棉麻混纺，利用废棉，设法揽到一部分加工任务，新棉上市后供应情况又有好转，从9月份起，年初停工的设备已陆续开工，第四季度完全可以进行全班正常生产。
    7、8月间，各单位检查和总结了增产节约运动，职工又提出了许多建议和措施，争取更多地超额完成增产节约的计划。据二十九个单位不完全统计，8、9月间共提出五百七十七项新的重大措施，使原订增产节约计划增加了四千万元。特别是自9月中旬各企业开展整风运动以后，领导上对生产作了适当安排，职工们生产热情高涨，做到了“整风生产两不误”，完成计划情况很好。据四十三个工厂的统计，9月份完成总产值115.98％，比8月份提高了14.67％。铁路系统的十四项生产指标，9月份除旅客发送人数完成计划的95％以外，其它十三项指标均完成或超额完成。
