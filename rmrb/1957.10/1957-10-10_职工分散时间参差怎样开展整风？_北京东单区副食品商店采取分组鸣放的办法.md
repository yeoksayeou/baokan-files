Xinhua News Agency report: Beijing's Dongdan District Non-Staple Food Retail Management Office, encompassing ninety state-owned retail stores, has been actively addressing the opinions raised by employees during the rectification campaign, leading to improvements in work.

Since the beginning of the airing of views on September 1st, employees of these stores had submitted a total of 10,782 comments by the end of September, including criticisms and suggestions, the vast majority of which were correct. The Dongdan District Non-Staple Food Retail Management Office Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, following the principle of "rectifying while correcting," has been assisting grassroots cadres in improving their work while mobilizing employees to discuss improvement methods. By September 28th, they had resolved 671 problems, large and small, encompassing 2,773 comments, accounting for more than a quarter of the total opinions raised by employees.

Leading cadres of the Dongdan District Non-Staple Food Retail Management Office accepted the employees' criticisms and examined their leadership style. At the same time, they established a system for section chiefs and directors to go deep into the grassroots four times a month to understand the situation and participate in physical labor. They also stipulated that employee congresses be held once per quarter. In terms of business management, they stipulated that in the future, goods should be rationally allocated according to the different purchasing power of different regions, and a dedicated person should be assigned to be on duty every day to be responsible for promptly answering questions about the prices of newly transferred goods. Most of the opinions concerning wages and benefits have also been addressed. Opinions related to Party-masses relations and the Communist Youth League and trade union organizations have been used for criticism and education of Party and League members, respectively. Some Party and League members have already developed plans to overcome their shortcomings. Many other opinions have been forwarded to relevant authorities for processing. Currently, the District Management Office is classifying and prioritizing unresolved issues and will gradually address them, striving to provide explanations for each.

Seeing that the rectification campaign could solve practical problems, employees are highly motivated. On one hand, they improve their work, and on the other hand, they actively offer more opinions. At the Dongdan District Non-Staple Food Grassroots Store Employee Representative Meeting on October 5th, employees posted more than 100 big-character posters on the spot. Lu Zhonglin, an employee of the food group, had concerns at the beginning of the rectification campaign. Later, he saw that the general affairs section handled the problem of copper pots he raised on the second day, which moved him greatly. He expressed his intention to express all his opinions and wrote several big-character posters while ill. The fruit group of the Fifth Store on Nanxiaojie Street had performed poorly in the past. In September, they overfulfilled the plan by 8%. The non-staple food group adopted the method of delivering goods to customers' homes, selling 600 jin of pressed salted duck and 6,900 preserved eggs in one day. Meat salesperson Zhang Qiduo and another colleague now purchase goods early every day and open for business early in the morning to reduce customers' queuing time. The Mishidajie Store got up in the middle of the night to stir-fry chestnuts to meet the needs of customers during the National Day holiday. Some employees rubbed blisters on their hands, but they had no complaints. The relationship among employees in a fruit group that had been divided in the past has improved after the rectification campaign.

Xinhua News Agency report: In the rectification campaign in the ninety state-owned non-staple food retail stores in Dongdan District, Beijing, the employees aired their views enthusiastically, and the leadership handled employee opinions quickly and conscientiously. Recently, a reporter interviewed Wei Fangnian, secretary of the Dongdan District Non-Staple Food Retail Management Office Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, about related issues in the airing of views.

How to carry out the airing of views when the non-staple food stores handle complex goods, are located in scattered locations, and have employees with varying business hours? Wei Fangnian told reporters that they first organized the stores in the vicinity into eight central groups, with each group responsible for the airing of views of a dozen or so stores. At the same time, they brought into play the organizational forces of the Party, government, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League and held several mobilization meetings to repeatedly explain the significance and purpose of the rectification campaign to the vast number of employees. At the mobilization meetings, the leadership not only had to dispel the masses' ideological concerns but also had to explain the problems that had already been solved. At the same time, it was also necessary to create conditions and venues for the masses to air their views, such as setting up suggestion boxes, visitor reception stations, and organizing various forms of symposiums. In this way, the employees' ideological concerns could be gradually eliminated, and the number of opinions raised would gradually increase. After the second mobilization meeting, the number of big-character posters increased by a quarter compared to before, and the number of opinions increased more than threefold, forming a high tide of airing of views.

With more than 10,000 opinions raised by employees, how can they be processed quickly? According to Wei Fangnian's analysis, the main thing is that leading cadres at all levels must have a clear understanding in their minds and realize that they must improve their work fiercely with revolutionary spirit. In addition to the fact that the heads of the Party, government, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League of the District Management Office formed five thematic research groups to put forward preliminary improvement plans, what is more important is to mobilize the vast masses to study together. Especially when dealing with major issues such as business management, organization, financial expenditures, and living welfare, it is necessary to rely closely on the masses and humbly absorb their opinions. When the problem has been processed to a certain stage, an employee representative meeting should be held to mobilize all employees to jointly study the methods of improving work.

Wei Fangnian also said that because the problems raised by employees in the airing of views cover a wide range, the best step-by-step solution is to start with the easy and then the difficult, and then from the specific to the principle. Repetitive and fragmented opinions should be summarized in order to find the central link and formulate improvement plans or systems to avoid old problems recurring after the rectification campaign.

    职工分散时间参差怎样开展整风？
    北京东单区副食品商店采取分组鸣放的办法
    新华社讯　北京市东单区副食品零售管理处所属九十个国营零售商店，积极处理职工在整风中提出的意见，工作已有改进。
    这些商店的职工在9月1日开始鸣放，到9月底共提出了一万零七百八十二条意见，其中有批评有建议，绝大部分是正确的。中共东单区副食品零售管理处委员会根据边整边改精神，一面帮助基层干部改进工作，一面发动职工讨论改进的办法，到9月28日止，已经解决了大小问题六百七十一个，包括二千七百七十三条意见，占职工提出意见总数的四分之一以上。
    东单区副食品零售管理处的领导干部，接受职工的批评，检查了领导作风，同时，订出科长、主任级干部每月四次深入基层了解情况和参加体力劳动的制度，规定每季召开一次职工大会。在经营管理方面，规定今后要按照地区购买力不同情况，合理地分配商品；每天指定专人值班，负责及时解答新调进商品的价格中的问题。对于有关工资福利方面的意见，也大都作了交代。属于党群关系及共青团和工会组织方面的意见，已分别对党、团员进行了批评和教育。有的党、团员已订出了克服缺点的计划。还有不少意见已转交有关机关处理。目前区管理处正在把没有解决的问题，分类排队，逐步处理，争取做到件件有交代。
    职工们看到整风能解决实际问题，情绪非常高，一方面改进工作，一方面更加踊跃地提意见。在10月5日东单区副食品基层商店职工代表会议上，职工们当场就贴出了一百多张大字报。食品组职工卢仲林在整风开始时，思想有顾虑，后来看到自己提出的铜锅问题，总务科第二天就处理了，很感动，表示要把意见都讲出来，并且在病中写了好几张大字报。南小街五店水果组过去完成计划较差，9月份超额8％完成了计划；副食品组采用了给顾客送货上门的办法，一天就推销板鸭六百斤、松花蛋六千九百个；肉食品营业员张其铎等二人，现在每天提前进货，一清早就开门营业，减少顾客排队时间。米市大街商店为了满足顾客国庆节日的需要，半夜就起来炒栗子，有的职工把手都磨出泡来，但毫无怨言。有一个水果组的职工过去闹不团结，经过整风，职工关系已有好转。
    据新华社讯　北京市东单区九十个国营副食品零售商店在整风中，职工鸣放得非常热烈，领导方面处理职工意见也很迅速、认真。最近，记者就鸣放中的有关问题访问了中共东单区副食品零售管理处委员会书记魏方年。
    副食品商店经营商品复杂，地址分散，职工营业时间参差不齐，在这种情况下，怎样开展鸣放？魏方年告诉记者，他们首先把地区相近的商店组成为八个中心组，每组负责十几家商店的鸣放工作。同时，发挥党政工团的组织力量，并开了好几次动员大会，向广大职工反复说明整风的意义和目的。在动员会上，领导上不但要解除群众的思想顾虑，还要交代已经解决的问题。与此同时，还要为群众创造鸣放条件和鸣放园地，如设立意见箱、来访接待站和组织各种形式的座谈会。这样，才能使职工的思想顾虑逐渐消除，提意见的日渐增多。在第二次动员大会后出现的大字报比以前增加了四分之一，意见增加三倍以上，形成鸣放高潮。
    职工提的意见万余条，怎样才能迅速处理？据魏方年分析，主要是各级领导干部思想上要明确，认识到必须用革命的精神狠狠地改进工作。除了区管理处的党政工团负责人组成了五个专题研究组，提出初步改进方案外，更重要的是发动广大群众一起研究。特别是在处理经营管理、机构、财务开支以及生活福利等重大问题时，一定要紧紧地依靠群众，虚心吸取群众意见。在问题处理到一定阶段时，要召开职工代表会议，以便发动全体职工共同研究改进工作的办法。
    魏方年还说，由于职工在鸣放中提出的问题涉及面很广，解决步骤最好是先易后难、先具体后原则。对一些重复、零碎的意见要加以归纳，以便找出中心环节，订出改进方案或制度，避免整风过后，又旧病重发。
