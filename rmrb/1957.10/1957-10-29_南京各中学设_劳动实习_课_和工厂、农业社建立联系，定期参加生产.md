Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. In the past month, groups of middle school students in Nanjing have been carrying their luggage to the countryside to attend production classes every day. Currently, over 20,000 middle school students have participated in short-term physical labor.

Since the establishment of "Labor Practice" courses in Nanjing middle schools this semester, connections have been established with agricultural cooperatives and factories. Some schools have assigned dedicated personnel to liaise with rural areas, understand the labor force needs of the countryside, and organize students to go to the countryside to participate in labor in a timely manner. Nanjing No. 5 Girls' Middle School has formally signed contracts with Nanjing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, bamboo goods processing factories, etc., and every Tuesday, teachers lead a group of students to the factory to participate in half a day of labor. Factory workers also actively and proactively teach students production techniques. More than 500 students and teachers from Nanjing No. 10 Middle School went to five agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs, eating, living, and working with the farmers, and humbly learning various farm work from the farmers.

Through labor practice, students have specifically seen the superiority of agricultural collectivization. After returning to school from participating in physical labor, many students have expressed their intention to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production after graduation.

    南京各中学设“劳动实习”课
    和工厂、农业社建立联系，定期参加生产
    新华社南京26日电　最近一月来，南京市每天都有一批中学生背着行李到农村去上生产课。目前已有两万多中学生参加了短期的体力劳动。
    南京各中学从本学期增设“劳动实习”课以来，同农业社和工厂建立了联系。有些学校指派专人负责和农村联系，了解农村需要劳动力的情况，及时组织学生下乡参加劳动。南京市第五女子中学和南京第一机械厂、竹货加工厂等正式签订了合同，每星期二由教师率领一批学生下厂参加半天劳动。工厂工人也积极主动地教学生学习生产技术。南京市第十中学的五百多名学生和教师分别到郊区的五个农业社，和农民同吃、同住、同劳动，虚心向农民学习各种农活。
    学生们在劳动实践中具体地看到农业合作化的优越性。很多学生在参加体力劳动回校后，纷纷表示毕业后要到农村去参加农业生产。
