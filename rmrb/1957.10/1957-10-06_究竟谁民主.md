Who is Truly Democratic?
Ruoshui

“I can't understand why socialist countries are said to be more democratic than capitalist countries. For example, the United States allows the publication of the *Worker's Daily*, but China doesn't allow the *Wenhui Bao* to take a bourgeois direction. It seems that the United States is more democratic than us.”

“Okay, let's analyze it to see who is truly democratic. The United States has more than 60 million workers, but only a pitifully few newspapers represent the interests of the working class. On the other hand, a small handful of financial oligarchs control most of the country's newspapers. The Hearst Corporation alone owns twenty newspapers. Is that democracy? If it can be called democracy, it is only democracy for the few.”

“But China doesn't even have a single bourgeois newspaper!”

“But China has more than a thousand people's newspapers. How much larger is this number than the number of newspapers representing the people in the United States?”

“I always feel that it is undemocratic not to allow the existence of bourgeois newspapers.”

“If this is undemocratic, it is only undemocratic to a minority, and democratic to the majority. Isn't the democracy of the majority more democratic than the democracy of the minority?”

“But if we allow a bourgeois newspaper to be run, so that the minority can also enjoy freedom of speech and publication like the majority, wouldn't our democracy be more complete?”

“On the contrary, our democracy would not be complete then. Who is ‘we’? It is the people. The people want to take the socialist road, and the bourgeois rightists want to take the capitalist road. These two roads cannot coexist, and these two kinds of freedom are mutually conflicting. Not restricting the freedom of the bourgeois rightists to carry out anti-socialist activities restricts the freedom of the people to take the socialist road. How can we say that our democracy would be more complete then?”

“The American *Worker's Daily* opposes capitalism, and the American bourgeois government hasn't shut it down!”

“If you think this is out of the bourgeoisie's goodwill and tolerance, you are wrong. In fact, the American government has adopted various means to persecute progressive newspapers and periodicals. The reason why a few progressive newspapers and periodicals can still exist is after struggle, and more importantly because the people support them behind the scenes. The bourgeois government does not yet dare to take resolute measures to completely prohibit the freedom of speech and publication of progressive forces, because they still have to maintain the hypocritical appearance of democracy. They will not tear off this mask until the class struggle is very tense. Even so, the freedom of progressive newspapers and periodicals is very limited, that is, they cannot harm the fundamental interests of the bourgeoisie.”

“Why is this hypocritical? Why do they have to be hypocritical?”

“They have to be hypocritical, because they are the ruling exploiting class, and they are the minority. Exposing the essence of the minority ruling the majority and letting the majority of working people see it at a glance is detrimental to them. Therefore, they always try their best to cover up this fact, saying that they represent all the people, and pretend that the democracy of the minority is ‘democracy for all.’ This requires some pretenses and some embellishments. But no matter what, the ruling class is always the representative of the bourgeoisie, and the government always has to maintain the capitalist exploitation system, so it is called hypocrisy. This is called the contradiction between form and content—the form is ‘democracy for all,’ and the content is the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The working class's parties and newspapers can exist in capitalist countries, that is, they use this contradiction. Under certain historical conditions, when domestic class struggle intensifies and the hypocritical form of democracy can no longer alleviate the struggle, but instead has the danger of being used by the working class to carry out legal struggle, the bourgeoisie will also abandon this hypocritical form and implement open and naked terrorist dictatorship. The past fascist regimes of Germany, Japan, and Italy were like this, and today the United States is gradually embarking on this path. As for us, we are the majority of the people ruling the extremely small number of reactionaries, and we are justified and confident. Therefore, we never use any disguise, but openly announce: we just don't give democracy to the reactionaries.”

“What you say makes some sense, but I still want to raise a question: Do you agree that it is always a good thing that working-class newspapers can be openly published in capitalist countries, and that it shows that there is still a remnant of democracy there?”

“I think we can say that.”

“Then shouldn't we also allow newspapers with a bourgeois orientation to exist?”

“We have newspapers for the industrial and commercial circles, but we do not allow newspapers to take a bourgeois direction. If we allow the existence of newspapers with a bourgeois orientation, that would be a bad thing.”

“So, you have one standard for others and another standard for yourselves.”

“No, here it seems that there are two standards, but in the final analysis there is only one standard, that is, the interests of the people. The publication of working-class newspapers in capitalist countries is beneficial to the people, and the existence of newspapers with a bourgeois orientation in socialist countries is detrimental to the people. The reason why you can't understand it is that you are not standing on the position of the people to look at the problem, and also because you regard democracy itself as the purpose. What you are talking about is abstract democracy. However, Chairman Mao has said that democracy is concrete, and democracy is not the purpose but the means. We must ask: Whose democracy? Bourgeois democracy or proletarian democracy? Democracy for the minority or democracy for the majority? What is this democracy used for? Once we ask these questions, it becomes clear what kind of democracy is good, what kind of democracy is bad, what kind of democracy we want, and what kind of democracy we don't want. Bourgeois newspapers are the superstructure of capitalism. We want to eliminate even its economic base, so can we still preserve this superstructure? The reason why bourgeois rightists hope that newspapers will take a bourgeois direction is to oppose socialism and attempt to restore capitalism. If we recognize this freedom and democracy, then they will use this freedom and democracy as a means to achieve their goals. We have a supreme standard for judging what is good and bad, right and wrong, and that is the greatest interest of the broadest masses of the people. If there is a kind of democracy that can be used to violate the interests of the people, then we will resolutely reject it, no matter who accuses us of being ‘undemocratic.’ The more the bourgeois rightists scold us for being undemocratic, the more it proves that we are democratic, and the more it proves that we are resolutely obeying the interests of the people.”

    究竟谁民主
    若水
    “说社会主义国家比资本主义国家更民主，我搞不通。举例说，美国可以允许工人日报发行，而中国的文汇报搞个资产阶级方向就不行；可见还是美国比我们民主。”
    “好吧，我们来分析分析看，究竟谁民主。美国有六千多万工人，但是代表工人阶级利益的报纸只有少得可怜的几份。另外一方面，一小撮金融寡头却掌握了全国大部分报纸，仅仅赫斯特系就拥有二十家报纸。这叫民主吗？如果可以叫民主的话，那只是少数人的民主。”
    “不过中国连一份资产阶级的报纸都没有哩！”
    “可是中国有一千多种人民的报纸，这个数目比美国的代表人民的报纸要多多少？”
    “我总觉得不允许资产阶级性质的报纸存在是不民主。”
    “如果这是不民主的话，那只是对少数人不民主，对多数人是民主的。难道多数人的民主不比少数人的民主更民主吗？”
    “可是如果我们允许办一个资产阶级的报纸，让少数人也和多数人一样享受言论出版自由，那么我们的民主不是更完全吗？”
    “恰恰相反，那时我们的民主就不完全了。‘我们’是谁呢？是人民。人民要走社会主义的路，资产阶级右派要走资本主义的路，这两条道路是不能并存的，这两种自由是互相冲突的。不限制资产阶级右派进行反社会主义活动的自由，就限制了人民走社会主义道路的自由，怎么还能说我们的民主会更完全呢？”
    “美国的工人日报是反对资本主义的，美国的资产阶级政府也没有封闭它呵！”
    “如果你以为这是出于资产阶级的善意和宽容，那就错了。实际上美国政府是采用了种种手段迫害进步报刊的，少数进步报刊之所以还能存在是经过了斗争的，更主要的是因为它们的背后有人民在支持。资产阶级政府现在还不敢采取断然的手段完全禁止进步力量的言论出版自由，因为他们还要维持民主的虚伪外表，不到阶级斗争十分紧张时，他们是不会撕下这副假面具的。即使这样，进步报刊的自由也是有很大限度的，就是不能危害资产阶级的根本利益。”
    “为什么这是虚伪呢？他们为什么要虚伪呢？”
    “他们非虚伪不可，原因就在他们是占统治地位的剥削阶级，而他们又是少数。暴露少数人统治多数人这个实质，让多数劳动人民一眼看清，这是于他们不利的。所以他们总要千方百计掩盖这个事实，说他们是代表全体人民的，把少数人的民主冒充为‘全民的’民主，这就必须装些样子，搞些点缀。但是不管怎样，执政的总是资产阶级的代表，政府总是要维护资本主义剥削制度，所以叫虚伪。这叫做形式和内容的矛盾——形式是‘全民的民主’，内容是资产阶级专政。工人阶级的政党和报纸能够在资本主义国家里存在，也就是利用了这个矛盾。在某些历史条件下，当国内阶级斗争尖锐化起来，用虚伪的民主形式已经不能缓和斗争，反而有被工人阶级利用去进行合法斗争的危险的时候，资产阶级也会丢开这个虚伪的形式，实行公开的赤裸裸的恐怖专政；过去的德日意法西斯就是这样，今天美国也在逐渐走上这条路。至于我们呢，我们是大多数人民统治极少数反动派，理直气壮，所以我们从来不用什么掩饰，而是公开的宣布：我们就是不给反动派以民主。”
    “这话固然有些道理，但是我还想提个问题：你是不是同意，工人阶级的报纸能够在资本主义国家公开发行，这总是一件好事，总表示那里还残存着一点民主吧？”
    “我想可以这样说。”
    “那么我们难道不同样应该允许资产阶级方向的报纸存在吗？”
    “我们有工商界的报纸，但是我们不允许报纸走资产阶级的方向。如果允许资产阶级方向的报纸存在，那就是一件坏事了。”
    “这样说来，你们对人家是一条标准，对自己又是一条标准了。”
    “不，这里看起来好像是两种标准，但是归根结蒂只有一条标准，那就是人民的利益。工人阶级的报纸在资本主义国家里发行是对人民有利的，资产阶级方向的报纸在社会主义国家里存在是对人民不利的。你之所以搞不通，原因就在你没有站在人民的立场来看问题，同时也因为你把民主本身当作目的，你所讲的是抽象的民主。但是，毛主席讲过了，民主是具体的，民主不是目的而是手段。我们要问：谁的民主？资产阶级的民主还是无产阶级的民主？少数人的民主还是多数人的民主？这民主是用来做什么？这样一问，什么民主好，什么民主不好，要什么样的民主，不要什么样的民主，就清楚了。资产阶级的报纸是资本主义的上层建筑，我们连它的经济基础都要消灭，还能保存这个上层建筑吗？资产阶级右派之所以希望报纸走资产阶级方向，就是要反对社会主义，企图使资本主义复辟。我们如果承认这种自由民主，那么他们就要利用这种自由民主来作为达到他们的目的的手段。我们有一条评判好坏是非的最高标准，那就是最广大人民的最大利益。如果有一种民主可以被利用来违反人民的利益，那么我们就坚决不要它，不管什么人责备我们‘不民主’。资产阶级右派越是骂我们不民主，就越证明我们民主，越证明我们是坚决服从人民的利益的。”
