Xinhua News Agency, 3rd — The Cambodian Cultural and Art Delegation held its first performance in China at the Beijing People's Theater on the evening of the 3rd.

Vice Premier of the State Council He Long, Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee Lu Dingyi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan and others attended and watched the performance. After the performance, Vice Premier He Long went to the stage to shake hands with the Cambodian artists.

Yang An, head of the Cambodian Economic Delegation to Beijing, also attended the performance tonight.

Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing delivered a welcome speech before the delegation's performance. He said that according to Chinese history books, Cambodian musicians had performed in China as early as the third century AD. Now, the visit and performance of the Cambodian Cultural and Art Delegation to China not only gives the vast number of Chinese people and artists the opportunity to appreciate and learn from Cambodia's excellent culture and art, but will also lay a good foundation for further cultural exchanges between the people of China and Cambodia. In particular, Princess Bopha Devi and Prince Sihanouk personally participated in the delegation's performance, which not only brought great honor to the Chinese people, but also added more brilliance to the performance.

Fang Bingzhen, head of the Cambodian Cultural and Art Delegation, then spoke. He said that Prince Sihanouk was very happy to send his children to perform for the Chinese people, and the Queen of Cambodia personally rehearsed the dance for the delegation. All of these demonstrate the very friendly relationship between the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Chinese people. After arriving in China, the delegation felt that there were many similarities between China and Cambodia in terms of scenery, life, and art. This shows that the people of the two countries have common ideals, and it also shows that the Chinese nation is a true friend of the Cambodian nation.

The first program performed by the delegation was the "Blessing Dance" specially rehearsed by the Queen of Cambodia to dedicate to Chairman Mao. Princess Bopha Devi led the performance of this program. The lyrics of this program include the following sentences: "May these flowers presented to you express our hearts, may you gain harvest and happiness, peace and friendship connect our two countries." More than a thousand audience members gave the program warm and long applause.

The delegation performed a total of nine programs tonight. These programs, with symbolic myths and legends, fully demonstrate the ancient and long-standing nature of Cambodian culture and art. Prince Chakrapong played the Monkey King in "The Monkey King Hanuman Tempts the Fish Queen Sovann Machha" tonight. The delegation's performance tonight was warmly welcomed by the audience.

    柬埔寨文化艺术代表团团长方秉祯接着讲话。他说，西哈努克亲王非常高兴送他的儿女前来为中国人民表演，柬埔寨王国的王后亲自为代表团排练舞蹈。这些都说明了柬埔寨王国对中国人民十分友好的关系。代表团到中国后，处处感到中柬两国的风光、生活和艺术上都有许多共同点，这说明两国人民有共同的理想，也说明了中华民族是柬埔寨民族的真正朋友。
    代表团演出的第一个节目，是柬埔寨王后特意排练献给毛主席的“祝福舞”。帕花·黛维公主领头表演了这个节目。这个节目的歌词有这样的句子：“愿这些呈献给你们的花朵，能表达出我们的心意，愿你们获得丰收和幸福，和平与友谊联系着我们两个国家。”一千多个观众，对这个节目报以热烈的长久的鼓掌。
    代表团今晚共演出了九个节目，这些节目带有象征性的神话传奇，充分表现柬埔寨文化艺术的古老和悠久。夏卡朋王子今晚在“猴王哈努曼引诱鱼后索万·木卡”中扮演猴王。代表团今晚的演出，受到了观众极为热烈的欢迎。（附图片）
