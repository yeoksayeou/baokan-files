Right-leaning Thought Hinders Progress in Political and Legal Work
By our reporter Yu Ming

Recently, this reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Political and Legal Department of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China on the problems existing in the political and legal work in Anhui Province. The questions and answers are as follows:

Q: In what facts is the right-leaning tendency in Anhui's political and legal work manifested?

A: The right-leaning phenomenon in Anhui's political and legal work is very obvious. It not only existed in the past, but has not been completely overcome now. For example, in Mengcheng County, a landlord, Yuan Zhengbin, fabricated a story that a poor peasant, Zhang Zhi'an (an activist during the land reform who had been allocated Yuan's house), stole his straw, and severely beat Zhang Zhi'an, who committed suicide out of anger. Township cadres and the masses escorted Yuan Zhengbin to the local People's Court, but the court refused to accept the case, claiming that there was no plaintiff (Zhang only had an eight-year-old child). In Wuhe County, a rich peasant, Chen Xianyin, deliberately cut six oxen of the agricultural cooperative. The county procuratorate, however, believed that it could not see that the crime was aimed at sabotaging the production of the agricultural cooperative and did not approve the arrest. In Binghui County, a rogue, Zhao Changyou, had repeatedly raped young girls. This spring, he raped another girl. The public security organs requested the procuratorate to approve the arrest, but the procuratorate's comment was: "Although the rape is a fact, it did not cause damage to the girl's body, so the arrest is not approved." There are many similar phenomena. In addition, for some counter-revolutionaries with blood debts, great crimes, and great popular resentment, only the lenient side is emphasized, and the policy of "counter-revolutionaries must be eliminated" is not implemented. For example, Tongguanshan once did not arrest Fu Deyun, a counter-revolutionary element with serious crimes, but waited for him to surrender himself. This kind of right-leaning performance has changed somewhat in recent months compared with last winter and this spring, but it still needs to be overcome continuously. From May to August, the preliminary inspection of only the three departments of public security, procuratorate, and court found that there were 261 cases that should have been arrested but were not, should have been sentenced but were not, were given light sentences for serious crimes, and were delayed for a long time without being sentenced. This shows that the right-leaning phenomenon still exists.

Q: What is the situation of Anhui Province's struggle against this right-leaning performance?

A: Anhui Province has already started to fight against the right-leaning performance in political and legal work since this spring. This spring, the Provincial Party Committee, on the one hand, dispatched many cadres to strengthen leadership over rural work, carry out democratic rectification of the communes, and resolve contradictions among the people; at the same time, it discovered that some cadres in the political and legal departments had serious right-leaning performances, and instructed the political and legal departments to criticize and correct this deviation, and deal with counter-revolutionaries and bad elements in accordance with the law. These measures have been supported by the vast number of rural cadres and the masses, and most of the political and legal cadres have actively implemented this instruction, which quickly raised the righteous spirit in the countryside and suppressed the evil spirit, making the agricultural cooperatives more consolidated and playing an important role in ensuring this year's bumper harvest. Political and legal cadres have also been educated by the facts, and most of them have raised their vigilance and earnestly implemented the state's laws. The significant increase in the rate of solving cases in the province in recent months is a good proof.

However, the right-leaning thought has not been well overcome in a few political and legal cadres. Among them, most people have a one-sided understanding of the policies of the Party and the state. For example, when conducting inspections of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, they had a one-sided understanding of the policy of combining suppression and leniency, and only focused on checking whether minor crimes were severely punished, whether those who should not have been arrested were arrested, etc., but did not well check those who should have been arrested but were not, those who should have been sentenced but were not, and those who were given light sentences for serious crimes. For current counter-revolutionaries, they only emphasized voluntary surrender, and did not give a strong blow to enemies who did not surrender and were determined to be enemies of the people. They believed that once they talked about contradictions among the people, they should not enforce laws and disciplines against criminals; they said that there were fewer counter-revolutionary elements, and it became a situation where counter-revolutionaries were not suppressed. After landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries were put into the cooperatives and capitalists were in joint state-private ownership, they did not look at their essence, and felt that everything was fine. They did not look at the specific situation, and shortened their sentences and terms of control, removed hats that should not have been removed, and changed components that should not have been changed. This situation was relatively common. Because they one-sidedly understood the policies of the Party and the state, they treated the enemy's sabotage activities as problems among the people and abandoned the dictatorial functions of political and legal work. These comrades did not have enough understanding of right-leaning thought even after criticizing right-leaning this spring, so the transformation shown was slow. During the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Conference in May this year, the Provincial Party Committee, while emphasizing the correct handling of contradictions among the people, emphasized that counter-revolutionaries and bad elements should still be dealt with in accordance with the law, and further criticized the thoughts of these comrades.

Some political and legal cadres are deeply influenced by bourgeois legal thought. They usually only talk about legal provisions, ignore the Party's policies, and ignore current affairs and politics, so that they do not understand the actual situation of the country, and their thoughts are often behind the times. They emphasize "judicial independence" and ignore the leadership of the Party. Therefore, when the Provincial Party Committee proposed criticizing right-leaning and supervising them, they believed that it undermined the independence of exercising their powers. The right-leaning thoughts of this group of people are still very serious.

A few people are right-wing elements hidden in the political and legal departments. These people stand on the position of landlords, rich peasants, and the bourgeoisie, oppose the Party, and oppose socialism. Of course, they oppose attacking the enemies of socialism. Chen Rengang, the secretary of the Party group and deputy director of the Anhui Provincial Department of Justice, is a typical example. He only emphasized that there were fewer counter-revolutionary elements, and said that what happened now were all contradictions among the people, and there was no such thing as right-leaning or not right-leaning. When counter-revolutionaries and bad elements beat cadres, he said that it was because the cadres were bureaucratic and had a bad work style; when counter-revolutionaries and bad elements incited grain riots and riots to withdraw from the cooperatives, he said that it was because there were shortcomings in our grain work, and that the instigators did not violate the law; he also said that inciting the masses to loot the agricultural cooperatives' grain was collective grain, not state grain, and did not violate the law, and he insisted on declaring "innocent" and releasing them in Feidong. He openly opposed the leadership of the Party. When the Provincial Party Committee proposed criticizing right-leaning based on the actual situation, he arranged to investigate "mistakes" and oppose "leftism" in southern Anhui and other places. It can be seen that the anti-Party activities of right-wing elements are a major obstacle to overcoming right-leaning among political and legal cadres.

This is the reason why the right-leaning thought is still very serious among some political and legal cadres in Anhui Province, even though a struggle against right-leaning has been carried out.

Q: How to strengthen political and legal work in the future?

A: At present, we must resolutely struggle against the right-wing elements among political and legal cadres. In the past period, right-wing elements usurped the leadership of the Department of Justice and released toxins throughout the province. First of all, we must eliminate these toxins. Right-wing elements are living "examples" for educating the broad masses of political and legal cadres. Through criticizing right-wing elements, we can distinguish right from wrong in political and legal work, find the root cause of right-leaning thought, and help overcome right-leaning thought.

We must oppose the erroneous thinking of some political and legal cadres who put obeying the leadership of the Party Committee in opposition to obeying the law. Facts have proved that political and legal cadres who are divorced from the leadership of the Party Committee cannot correctly implement the law, and even undermine the law, causing political and legal work to lose its effectiveness of dictatorship. Therefore, the bourgeois legal point of view must be eliminated, and political and legal work must have the leadership of the Party Committee. It is absolutely not allowed to seek independence from the Party. This is the key to improving political and legal work.

We must earnestly conduct education on the two types of contradictions and socialist ideological education for political and legal cadres in order to correctly handle the two types of contradictions. The Procurator General of Wuwei County said: "In the past, it was believed that it was enough to study law and professional knowledge, and political study was neglected. Now it is clear that if we do not study political current affairs, our thinking will lag behind the development of the situation. As a result, the two types of contradictions are confused, how can we enforce the law?" This is a task that must be carried out well among all political and legal cadres.

　　右倾思想妨碍着政法工作前进
　　本报记者  于明
    最近，记者就安徽省政法工作中存在的问题，访问了中共安徽省委政法部的负责人，问答如下：
    问：安徽省政法工作中的右倾表现在那些事实上？
    答：安徽省政法工作中的右倾现象是十分明显的，不但过去有，现在也还未完全克服。如蒙城县有一个地主袁正彬，捏造贫农张治安（土改时的积极分子，分过袁的房子）偷他稻草，毒打张治安，张治安气愤自杀。乡干部和群众把袁正彬扭送当地人民法院，法院竟认为没有原告（张只有一个八岁的孩子），不予受理。五河县一个富农陈先银，有意砍伤农业社六条牛，该县检察院却认为看不出是以破坏农业社生产为目的的犯罪，不批准逮捕。炳辉县一个流氓赵长友，曾多次强奸幼女，今春又强奸一女孩，公安机关提请检察院批准逮捕，检察院的批语却说：“强奸虽属事实，但于女孩身体未造成损害，不予逮捕。”类似这种现象很多。此外，对一些有血债、罪恶大、民愤大的反革命也只强调宽大的一面，不执行
  “有反必肃”的方针。如铜官山就曾对一个有重大罪行的反革命分子富德运不加逮捕，只等投案。这种右倾表现，最近几月已经比去冬今春有所改变，但是仍需继续加以克服。从5月到8月，只是公安、检察、法院三个部门的初步检查，就发现有二百六十一件案件是属于该捕不捕，该判未判，重罪轻判和长期拖延未判的。这说明右倾现象还是有的。
    问：安徽省和这种右倾表现斗争的情况怎样？
    答：安徽省从今年春天开始，便已经对政法工作中的右倾表现进行了斗争。省委在今年春天一面下放许多干部，加强对农村工作的领导，进行民主整社，解决人民内部矛盾；同时发现政法部门某些干部有严重右倾表现，便指示政法部门批判和纠正这种偏向，对反革命和坏分子依法处理。这些措施，得到广大农村干部和群众的拥护，政法干部绝大多数人也都积极执行了这一指示，使农村中的正气很快抬头，邪气被压下去，农业社更加巩固，对保证今年农业的大丰收起了重要作用。在政法干部中，也受到了事实的教育，大多数人的警惕性提高了，认真地执行国家的法律。全省最近几个月的破案率显著提高，就是一个很好的证明。
    但是，在少数政法干部中右倾思想仍没有很好克服。他们之中，大多数人对党和国家的政策，在认识上有片面性。如对肃反进行检查时，便对镇压和宽大相结合的方针有片面了解，只着重检查轻罪是否重判，不该捕的捕起来了等等，但对该捕未捕，该判未判及重罪轻判的，却没有很好检查。在对现行反革命则只强调了自动投案，对不投案而又坚决与人民为敌的敌人，就没有给以有力打击。他们认为一谈人民内部矛盾，就对犯罪分子也不应该执行法纪了；说是反革命分子少了，就变成有反不肃。对地主富农、反革命放进了社、资本家在公私合营以后，便不看其本质，觉得万事大吉，不看具体情况，对他们缩短刑期、管制期，不该摘帽子的摘了帽子，不应改变成份的改变了成份，这种情况比较普遍。因为他们片面地理解党和国家的政策，便把敌人的破坏活动也当成人民内部问题来处理，放弃了政法工作专政的职能。这些同志在今春批判右倾以后，思想上还对右倾思想认识不足，所以表现的转变慢。今年5月省委宣传会议期间，省委在强调正确处理人民内部矛盾的同时，强调对反革命和坏分子仍应依法办事，对这些同志的思想又进一步作了批判。
    有些政法干部，受资产阶级法律思想的影响很深，他们平时只空谈法律条文，忽视党的政策，忽视时事政治，以致不了解国家的实际情况，思想常常落后于形势。他们强调“审判独立”，忽视党的领导。所以当省委提出批判右倾，对他们进行监督时，他们就认为是破坏了行使职权的独立性。这部分人的右倾思想至今仍很严重。
    有少数人，则是隐藏在政法部门中的右派分子。这种人站在地主富农和资产阶级的立场上，反党反社会主义，他们当然反对打击社会主义的敌人。安徽省司法厅的党组书记、副厅长陈仁刚就是一个典型。他只强调反革命分子少了，说现在发生的都是人民内部矛盾，无所谓右倾不右倾。反革命和坏分子打了干部，他就说是因为干部官僚主义，作风不好；反革命和坏分子煽动闹粮、闹退社，他就说这是因为我们粮食工作中有缺点，说煽动者不犯法；又说煽动群众扒农业社的粮食，是集体的粮食，不是国家的，不犯法，他硬叫肥东宣判“无罪”释放。他公开反对党的领导，当省委根据实际情况提出批判右倾时，他却在皖南等地布置查“错”反“左”。可见，右派分子的反党活动，是在政法干部中克服右倾的大阻力。
    这就是安徽省虽然进行了批判右倾的斗争，在部分政法干部中右倾思想仍很严重的原因。
    问：今后怎样加强政法工作？
    答：目前必须对政法干部中的右派分子进行坚决斗争。右派分子在过去一个时期篡夺了司法厅的领导，在全省施放了毒素，首先要清除这些毒素。右派分子是对广大政法干部进行教育的活的“榜样”，通过对右派分子的批判，就能分清政法工作中的是非，找出右倾思想的根源，有助于帮助克服右倾思想。
    反对有些政法干部把服从党委领导同服从法律对立起来的错误思想。事实证明，政法干部脱离了党委领导，也就不可能正确地执行法律。甚至破坏了法律，使政法工作失掉了专政的效能。因此资产阶级的法律观点必须清除，政法工作必须有党委的领导，绝不允许向党闹独立性，这是改进政法工作的关键。
    认真对政法干部进行两类矛盾的教育，进行社会主义思想教育，以正确处理两类矛盾。无为县的检察长说：“过去认为只要学习法律和业务知识就够了，对政治学习忽视。现在明确了，不学习政治时事，思想就会落后于形势的发展，结果把两类矛盾都混淆不清，怎能执行法律？”这是在所有政法干部中都必须很好进行的工作。
