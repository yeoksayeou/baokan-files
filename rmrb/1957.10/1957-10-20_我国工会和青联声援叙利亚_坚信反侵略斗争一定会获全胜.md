　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, today sent a telegram to the Syrian Federation of Trade Unions, once again declaring that Chinese workers will forever stand with all Arab workers and people in the struggle against imperialist aggression. In his telegram, Lai Ruoyu said: "Chinese workers are extremely indignant to learn that U.S. imperialism is instigating Turkey to carry out armed provocations against Syria and is plotting to launch a war of aggression. This despicable act has seriously threatened the independence and security of Syria and the Arab countries, seriously threatening world peace, and once again exposing the colonialist nature of the 'Eisenhower Doctrine'. Chinese workers strongly condemn this criminal act."
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The All-China Youth Federation, representing 120 million Chinese youth, today sent a telegram to the Syrian Student Union and forwarded it to all young Syrian friends, expressing firm support for the Syrian people's struggle to defend their national independence and resist aggression.
    The telegram stated: "The war plot of U.S. imperialism in instigating Turkey to attempt an armed aggression against Syria has aroused great anger among the youth and people of China. We will resolutely stand with you and fully support the heroic struggle of Syrian youth and people against colonialism and for the maintenance of peace in the Middle East and the world. We firmly believe that your just struggle will be victorious! The imperialist plot of aggression will certainly be defeated!"
