According to the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, formulate a ten to fifteen year livestock development plan.
    Livestock in Inner Mongolia will increase one to two times.
    (Our newspaper, Hohhot, 27th) The rectification movement will greatly promote the development of animal husbandry in Inner Mongolia. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China has formulated a plan for the development of animal husbandry. In the next ten to fifteen years, the region's livestock is required to develop from the current 22 million head to 50 million to 60 million head; fine wool sheep and semi-fine wool sheep are to be developed to 10 million; and a large number of high-quality livestock such as "Sanhe Horses" and "Sanhe Cattle" are to be developed. The implementation of this plan will provide a large amount of wool, milk, meat, leather, and draft animals to support the country's industrial and agricultural production and meet the needs of the people's lives.
    This plan was discussed and approved at the plenary meeting of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held from October 14 to 24. The meeting discussed and arranged how to fully implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and at the same time, focused on examining and discussing the animal husbandry issues in the autonomous region in the spirit of rectification. The materials provided by the meeting show that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the strong assistance of the state, and the efforts of people of all ethnic groups, Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry has developed rapidly after liberation. From 1947 to 1957, the region's livestock increased from more than 8 million head to more than 22 million head. It has nearly tripled in ten years. This rate of development has not been seen in any period in history. At the same time, socialist transformation is steadily progressing in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia. More than 80% of the herdsmen in the region have participated in mutual aid organizations, of which 24% of the herdsmen have participated in cooperatives. All 632 livestock cooperatives established in the region have been consolidated. Last year's distribution resulted in increased production in 95% of the cooperatives.
    The meeting examined many shortcomings and errors in animal husbandry. For example, since 1954, although the total number of livestock in the region has increased every year, the net increase rate of livestock has declined. Especially in 1957, the total number of livestock in the region not only did not increase, but decreased compared with the previous year, which had an adverse impact on the autonomous region's first five-year plan in animal husbandry. The meeting believes that this is a serious lesson for the leaders at all levels in the autonomous region and the people of the region. The meeting examined the reasons for the decrease in livestock and believed that the main reasons were: First, in the cooperative movement in agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, the characteristics of the animal husbandry economy were ignored, there were certain deviations and errors in the implementation of policies, and the policy of "carrying out socialist transformation on the basis of stable development of animal husbandry production" was not implemented. In specific work, some places violated the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, which to a certain extent frustrated the enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen to develop livestock, and in some areas, it caused farmers and herdsmen to slaughter and sell livestock in large quantities. Second, livestock disasters were very serious, and the basic construction and specific measures for developing animal husbandry were far behind the needs of developing production. Third, necessary economic and political work was not done well. The meeting also strictly criticized the "emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry" ideology among leading cadres in agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, believing that this ideology is essentially a neglect of national characteristics and regional characteristics, and is a concrete manifestation of bureaucracy and subjectivism that is divorced from reality and the masses. If this ideology is not overcome, animal husbandry in these areas will be difficult to develop.
    The meeting first analyzed the natural conditions of Inner Mongolia and believed that Inner Mongolia has great potential for developing animal husbandry. In the pastoral areas of the autonomous region, there are 760,000 square kilometers of usable pastures, plus 80,000 square kilometers of pastures scattered in agricultural areas, totaling 840,000 square kilometers. Making full use of these pastures, coupled with some basic construction and efforts in all aspects, it is possible to develop livestock to 50 million to 60 million head in the next ten to fifteen years. This is extremely beneficial to the country and the people. If the state invests 100 million yuan in this area, and there are 10 million fine wool sheep in the livestock, then the wool produced in just one year can have an income of 100 million yuan (10 million fine wool sheep can produce about 40 million kilograms of wool a year, with a value of 3.4 yuan per kilogram).
    In order to realize this plan, the meeting decided to invest certain manpower and financial resources, strengthen the leadership of party organizations at all levels over animal husbandry, vigorously carry out water conservancy construction in pastoral areas, improve grasslands, improve livestock breeds, and strengthen veterinary epidemic prevention work. Comrade Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, in his concluding remarks at the meeting, asked everyone to do everything possible to strive for the successful realization of this plan. He said: Our country's livestock products are now very scarce. With the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives, the demand in this area will become increasingly urgent. Inner Mongolia's livestock now accounts for about one-tenth of the country's total livestock. People of all ethnic groups should work hard to build our vast grasslands into an important base for the country's development of animal husbandry and provide the country with abundant livestock products.
    Now, the relevant departments of the autonomous region are further formulating specific plans in accordance with the requirements of the plan. (Lin Mo)

### 根据三中全会精神制定十年到十五年畜牧业发展计划  内蒙古牲畜将增加一到两倍

    根据三中全会精神制定十年到十五年畜牧业发展计划
    内蒙古牲畜将增加一到两倍
    本报呼和浩特27日电　整风运动将大大促进内蒙古地区畜牧业的发展。中共内蒙古自治区委员会已制定了关于发展畜牧业的计划。在今后十年到十五年内，要求全区牲畜由现在的二千二百万头发展到五千至六千万头；细毛羊及半细毛羊发展到一千万只；还要大量发展“三河马”、“三河牛”等优良牲畜。这一规划的实现，将提供大量的羊毛、牛奶、肉类、皮革和耕畜，以支援国家的工农业生产和满足人民生活的需要。
    这个规划是在10月14日到24日召开的中共内蒙古自治区全体委员会上讨论和通过的。这次会议曾讨论和布置了如何全面贯彻中共八届三中全会的精神，同时以整风精神着重检查和讨论了自治区的畜牧业问题。会议提供的材料说明：内蒙古的畜牧业，解放后在共产党的正确领导、国家的大力援助和各族人民的努力下，有了很快的发展。从1947到1957年，全区牲畜由八百余万头发展到二千二百余万头。十年内增加近两倍，这样的发展速度，是历史上任何时期所没有的。同时，内蒙古牧区正在稳步地进行社会主义改造。全区80％以上的牧民参加了互助组织，其中有24％的牧户参加了合作社。全区已建立的六百三十二个牧业社都巩固下来了。去年分配的结果，95％的社都增了产。
    会议检查了畜牧业方面的许多缺点和错误。如从1954年以来，全区牲畜的总头数虽每年有所增加，但牲畜的纯增率却发生了下降的现象。特别是1957年，全区牲畜的总头数不但没有增加，反而较上一个年度有了减少，以致对自治区在畜牧业方面的第一个五年计划发生了不利的影响。会议认为，这对自治区的各级领导和全区人民都是一个严重的教训。会议检查了牲畜减少的原因，认为主要是：第一，在农业区和半农半牧区的合作化运动中，忽视了畜牧业经济的特点，在执行政策上有一定的偏差和错误，没有贯彻执行“在稳定发展畜牧业生产的基础上，进行社会主义改造”的方针，在具体工作上，有些地方又违背了自愿互利的原则，因而在一定程度上挫折了农牧民发展牲畜的积极性，在某些地区，引起了农牧民对牲畜的大量宰杀和出卖。第二，牧业灾害很重，发展畜牧业的各项基本建设和具体措施，远远落后于发展生产的需要。第三，必要的经济工作和政治工作没有作好。会议还严格批判了农业区和半农半牧区领导干部中的“重农轻牧”思想，认为这种思想实质上是忽视民族特点和地区特点，是脱离实际，脱离群众的官僚主义、主观主义的具体表现。不克服这种思想，这些地区的畜牧业就很难得到发展。
    会议首先分析了内蒙古的自然条件，认为内蒙古地区发展畜牧业是有很大潜力的。在自治区的牧区，可供使用的牧场有七十六万平方公里，连同农业区分散的八万平方公里牧场，共有八十四万平方公里。充分利用这些牧场，加上若干基本建设和各方面的努力，在今后十年到十五年内，把牲畜发展到五千万至六千万头是可能做到的。这样作对国家和人民是极为有利的。如果国家在这方面投资一亿元，在牲畜中有一千万只细毛羊，那么仅一年所产的羊毛，就可以有一亿元的收入（一千万只细毛羊，一年约可产毛四千万公斤，每公斤价值三点四元）。
    为实现这一规划，会议决定要投入一定的人力和财力，加强各级党组织对畜牧业的领导，大力开展牧区水利建设，改良草原，改良牲畜品种，加强兽疫防治工作。自治区党委第一书记乌兰夫同志在作会议总结时，要求大家尽一切努力争取这一规划的胜利实现。他说：我们国家的畜产品现在是很少的，随着工农业生产的发展和人民生活的提高，对这方面的要求将日益迫切。内蒙古的牲畜现在约占全国牲畜总数的十分之一，各族人民应该努力把我们的广大草原建设成为国家发展畜牧业的重要基地，为国家提供丰富的畜产品。
    现在，自治区各有关部门，正在根据规划要求，进一步制订各项具体方案。　（林沫）
