Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 4th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Tiqiang reports: During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, Gansu Province implemented the policy of relying on the masses to build small-scale water conservancy projects. In the past five years, more than 7.4 million mu of new irrigated land has been created. Together with the land before 1952, the province now has more than 15 million mu of irrigated land. Of the 6.08 million mu of newly built irrigated land in the first four years of the Five-Year Plan, three-quarters were built by the masses at their own expense. This year's water conservancy projects have not yet been fully counted, but from the known 1 million mu of irrigated land, state investment accounted for only 30%, while 70% was still built by the masses at their own expense.

The increased irrigated land during the Five-Year Plan period, calculated at an average cost of 21 yuan per mu, required an expenditure of more than 155.4 million yuan, most of which did not require state expenditure. According to estimates by the agricultural and water conservancy departments, converting dry land to irrigated land increases grain production by at least 150 jin per mu. These newly built 7.4 million mu of irrigated land can increase grain production by more than 1.1 billion jin per year.

Gansu Province is characterized by many mountains, drought, and extremely insufficient labor in many areas. According to statistics, mountainous areas account for 70% of the province. For more than 300 years, a relatively serious drought has occurred on average every two years. In many areas, one laborer has to bear the task of cultivating 20, 30, or even 50 mu of land. Therefore, before liberation, farmers were reluctant to build small-scale water conservancy projects. After liberation, Party organizations and governments at all levels in Gansu Province regarded the development of small-scale water conservancy as an important link in increasing grain production, and put forward the slogan "Water is grain, water is life," relying on the strength of cooperatives to mobilize hundreds of thousands of farmers to build water conservancy projects every year. In 1956, at the highest point, more than 1.5 million farmers (accounting for 36% of the province's total labor force) participated in the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects. As a result, the number of irrigated land increased unprecedentedly. In many areas, the amount of irrigated land has doubled, tripled, and in some cases even increased dozens or hundreds of times. Some counties that originally had only dozens or hundreds of mu of irrigated land have now become counties with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of mu of irrigated land.

Gansu first adopted the extremely important policy of utilizing all water sources in the development of small-scale water conservancy projects. The climate in Gansu Province is very dry, with an average annual rainfall of only about 300 mm. According to this natural characteristic, various places, in addition to making full use of surface water and groundwater, also try to utilize rainwater as much as possible. Some areas do not have much surface water or groundwater, so they put forward the slogan "Irrigate one mu if you can, irrigate one fen if you can," so that all water sources, large and small, can play a role. In order to develop irrigated land, farmers in the bitter water areas of Guyuan and Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefectures carry ice and accumulate snow every winter. The ice is formed in the bitter water river. Bitter water cannot be used to irrigate the land, but the ice formed by bitter water is very sweet and can be used for irrigation. The Hexi Corridor, which relies on the snow water of the Qilian Mountains to irrigate farmland, not only tries to prevent excessive water loss during the irrigation process, but also actively protects the snow line of the Qilian Mountains and prevents the snow line from rising and the amount of snow water from decreasing year by year by cultivating and renewing the original forests of the Qilian Mountains.

Gansu Province has many mountains, large mountains, deep gullies, and low water levels. In order to build hundreds or thousands of mu of irrigated land, it is often necessary to cut through mountains and fill gullies, bypass several mountains, and then draw water up the mountains. In order to block a small flood, some places must build large dams. When Gansu Province overcame this difficulty, it also mainly relied on the masses of farmers, training a large number of farmers to become technicians, and relying on them to lead the construction movement of small-scale water conservancy. Now the province has achieved "technology in every society, backbone in every township," and there are more than 90,000 farmer water conservancy technicians.

Gansu Province also pays attention to using slack farming seasons and establishing year-round basic construction teams to carry out small-scale water conservancy movements in various places. The latter method has been adopted by Tianshui, Pingliang, Dingxi and other regions, and has proved to be a good way to solve the labor contradictions between agriculture and water conservancy construction. Gansu Province has decided to promote it universally.

### 依靠群众大量兴修小型水利  甘肃干旱面貌正在改变

    依靠群众大量兴修小型水利
    甘肃干旱面貌正在改变
    据新华社兰州4日电　新华社记者王体强报道：甘肃省在第一个五年计划期间，执行了依靠群众兴修小型水利的方针，五年来新修水田七百四十多万亩，连同1952年以前的，现在全省已有一千五百多万亩水地。在五年计划头四年新修的六百零八万亩水地中，由群众自费兴修的占四分之三，今年的水利工程还没有完全统计，但从已知的一百多万亩水地来看，国家投资兴修的也不过占30％，而70％仍是群众自费修成的。
    五年计划期间增加的水地，按兴修水地费用平均每亩以二十一元计算，需要支出一亿五千五百四十多万元，这笔费用也大部分不要国家支出。据农业和水利部门估算，旱地变水地每亩最少增产一百五十斤粮食，这新修的七百四十多万亩水地一年即可增产粮食十一亿多斤。
    甘肃省的特点是：多山、干旱而在许多地区劳动力又极为不足。据统计全省山区面积占70％，三百多年来平均每两年就要发生一次比较严重的旱灾，很多地区一个劳动力要负担二十亩、三十亩甚至五十亩的耕地任务。因此解放前农民对兴修小型水利裹足不前。解放后甘肃省各级党组织和政府把发展小型水利作为增产粮食的重要环节，提出“水就是粮食，水就是命”的口号，依靠合作社的力量，每年动员了几十万农民兴修水利，1956年最高时有一百五十多万农民（占全省总劳动力的36％），参加兴修小型水利。这样，水地的数目便空前增加。很多地区的水地增加了一倍、二倍，有的甚至增加了几十倍、几百倍。一些原来只有几十亩或几百亩水地的县，现在变成了拥有几万亩或十几万亩水地的县。
    甘肃在发展小型水利工程中最先采取了必须利用一切水源这个极为重要的方针。甘肃省的气候很干旱，平均年雨量不过三百公厘左右，根据这一自然特点，各地除了充分利用地面水和地下水，还尽量利用雨水。有的地区地面水源和地下水源都不多，便提出“能浇一亩是一亩，能浇一分是一分”的口号，让大大小小的水源都发生作用。固原、吴忠两个回族自治州苦水地区的农民为了发展水浇地，每年冬季，背冰积雪。冰是结在苦水河里的，苦水不能浇地，但苦水结成的冰很甜，可以作灌溉用。依靠祁连山雪水灌溉农田的河西走廊，农民们不仅设法防止在灌溉过程中水的过分损耗，还积极从抚育更新祁连山原始森林着手，保护祁连山雪线，制止雪线上升和雪水量逐年减少的现象。
    甘肃省山多、山大、沟深，水位偏低。为了兴修几百亩或几千亩水地，常常必须劈山填沟，绕过几道山然后引水上山；为了拦蓄一股不大的洪水，有的地方就必须建筑大坝。甘肃省在克服这个困难的时候，也是主要依靠农民群众，把大批农民培养成为技术人员，依靠他们领导小型水利的建设运动。现在这个省已做到“社社有技术，乡乡有骨干”，农民水利技术员已达九万多名。
    甘肃省各地开展小型水利运动还注意利用农闲时间和建立常年基本建设队。后一种办法经过天水、平凉、定西等地区采用，已证明是解决农业、水利建设之间劳动力矛盾的好办法，甘肃省已决定普遍推广。
