Diligent Management of Household Affairs, Simplify Weddings and Funerals
Saving Grain Becomes a Trend in Many Areas of Jiangxi

(Dispatch from our newspaper) The vast number of peasants in Wan'nian, Wan'an, Jinxian, Lianhua, Anyi, Pingxiang, Shangrao and other counties in Jiangxi Province have received a profound education in the great debate on the grain issue. They realized that "thrift is glorious, waste is shameful," and thus consciously came up with various ways to save grain.

More than 80,000 agricultural cooperative members in Wannian County have launched a wave of saving grain. In Xinhua Township of the county, more than 400 cooperative member households originally planned to hold various celebrations at the end of this year, involving heavy eating and drinking. After the debate, everyone proposed to simplify everything. In Zhangjia Team of Zhangjia Cooperative of Pengyuan Township, the 42 cooperative member households originally planned to hold 15 events for birthdays, weddings, and full-month celebrations for children, but decided not to hold them or to simplify them. Chen Zhongshan, a member of the Communist Youth League in the township, originally planned to make 8.5 dou of rice cakes and 6 tables of banquets for his wedding day, but after consultation between the two parties, it was cancelled. In terms of feeding livestock and poultry, many places have begun to change the wasteful phenomenon of using rice to feed pigs in the past. In Songgang Cooperative, most of the masses used rice to feed pigs. After the education on saving grain, women expressed that they would no longer use rice to feed pigs in the future. Women's team leader Bian Miaoxian led 14 women to Hong Kong to collect aquatic plants to feed pigs. Zhangjia Production Team raised 70 pigs. In the past, each pig had to be fed half a catty to one catty of rice a day. Now, more than 20 women go to the slopes every day to pull weeds for fodder, and rarely use grain for fodder. At the same time, 15 mu of radishes were planted in the chicken-mouth fields that were originally not planned to be planted, as pig feed. In addition, through the great debate, many housewives who are good at arranging household grain use have emerged and become the main force in saving grain. In order to make saving grain a regular practice, many agricultural cooperatives have also formulated specific plans.

After the socialist debate, many townships and cooperatives in Wan'an County put forward the call to save "one liang of rice." Households with larger populations also made plans to save grain for "one sheng of rice," "two sheng of rice," and "three sheng of rice" in the short period from now to the spring plowing. The day after the great debate began in Tuanjie No. 1 Cooperative, 90% of the cooperative members stopped using rice to feed pigs; in this cooperative of 110 households, each household saved an average of one to two sheng of rice. Chen Zhiyi, a member of Shengli No. 1 Cooperative, saw that the early and mid-season rice had increased in production, and the late rice and second-season crops were growing well, so he asked the cooperative to distribute 600 jin of wine grain. After being educated in the great debate, he voluntarily returned 100 jin of the 200 jin of wine grain he had already received to the cooperative. He Zhaojiu, a member of Jiantian Cooperative, used to feed newborn piglets with white rice porridge for more than a month, but now he has changed to feeding them for seven days, and the rest is replaced by grinding white soybean milk and mixing it with pumpkin. Members of Changsheng No. 5 Cooperative are now actively collecting and storing feed. The 19 cooperative members of the second team of the cooperative have dried 177 dan of silk grass, and the households with the most have stored 25 dan. Sweet potato vines from private plots throughout the county have also begun to be collected and dried. Fenglin and Yanjiang townships, known as "the land of oil and rice," have also joined the saving movement. Those who are accustomed to making "dangmi pi" (a kind of food), used to make at least two dou of rice per household, and more than one dan of rice, but now they all say they will save and not make it. Xiao Hongshi, a member of Senlin No. 2 Cooperative, also filtered out and dried 25 sheng of early rice that was being soaked in water to make "tangzao" and used it to make rice. At present, most townships, cooperatives, and households in the county have formulated plans to increase production and save, making the movement to increase production and save a regular practice. The county expanded the planting of buckwheat by 13,275 mu. In order to better develop feed land for next spring and replace part of the staple food, the county is expected to expand the planting of radish fields by more than 12,000 mu.

After distinguishing between "the state's unified purchase of grain cannot be reduced" and "the three-fixed rations are enough to eat," members of Jinxian, Lianhua, Anyi, Pingxiang, Shangrao and other counties have automatically returned the over-allocated rations, plugged loopholes in waste, and saved grain in all aspects. In Chongyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Pingxiang County, each person retained 40 to 60 jin more when dividing rations during the summer harvest. After the debate, the cooperative members automatically returned 35,000 jin. In Baishu Cooperative in Anyi County, all 271 households in the cooperative set a standard of 480 jin of millet per person on average, and formulated a grain consumption plan based on the busy and slack seasons and the light and heavy farm work. In order to ensure that they know how much grain to use, some cooperative members in Xinse Township in Jinxian County weigh the rice when cooking, and children also eat according to the amount, without leaving leftovers. When washing rice, they do not allow rice to be poured into the swill bucket, and they change grinding grain to hulling grain, which can produce more rice. In Lianhua County, 71 cooperatives have formed a conscious action among cooperative members to save grain. In Wuzhou No. 1 Branch of Pingli Township, five families recently held weddings. Originally, each family planned to make eight to twelve tables of banquets. After formulating a grain saving agreement, three families did not do it. Families who used to misuse grain to feed pigs now try to use sweet potato vines, small sweet potato roots, or dig wild vegetables to feed pigs.

The grassroots Party members and cadres of these counties and townships have played an active leading role in saving grain, setting a good example for the masses. Liu Dunliu, a Party member of Jingtai No. 3 Branch of Luotian Township in Anyi County, has a family of seven, and the three-fixed grain retention is 3,300 jin. Last year, he was allocated 4,400 jin of rations. He could not finish eating them, and used grain to make wine, rice noodles, and feed chickens, wasting 1,230 jin. After the debate, he voluntarily reduced the family's rations to 3,170 jin, which is 130 jin less than the three-fixed grain retention standard. Party member Liu Yiqing also made a detailed arrangement for his family's annual grain consumption. His family of four has a three-fixed grain retention standard of 1,950 jin, an average of 162.5 jin per month. He plans to eat only 120 jin per month in November, December, and January, saving 127.5 jin; to eat according to the three-fixed standard in February, March, September, and October; and to eat 187 jin per month in April, May, June, July, and August when farm work is heavier. In total, the annual grain consumption is only 1,945 jin, slightly lower than the three-fixed grain retention standard.

    勤俭操持家务　婚丧一切从简
    江西很多地区节约粮食成风气
    本报讯　江西省万年、万安、进贤、莲花、安义、萍乡、上饶等县的广大农民，在粮食问题的大辩论中，受到了一次深刻的教育。他们认识到“节约光荣、浪费可耻”，因而都自觉地想出各种办法节约粮食。
    万年县八万多农业社的社员，掀起了节约粮食的热潮。该县新华乡原有四百多户社员计划在今年年底办各种喜事，大吃大喝，经过辩论，大家都提出要一切从简。彭沅乡张家社张家队的四十二户社员，原准备办生日、结婚和给小孩做满月的共有十五场，也都决定不办或从简。该乡共青团员陈忠山原来准备在结婚那天做八斗五升米的麻果和六桌酒席，也经过双方协商后免除了。在喂养家畜家禽上，许多地方开始改变了过去用大米喂猪的浪费现象。松岗社原来群众养猪多是用米，经过节约粮食教育，妇女们都表示今后不再用米喂猪。妇女队长卞苗先带领十四个妇女到港里捞水草喂猪。张家生产队养了七十头猪，以前每头猪一天要喂半斤到一斤米，现在天天有二十多个妇女上坂拔野草做饲料，很少用粮食做饲料。同时，在原计划不种的鸡口田里，种上十五亩萝卜，做猪的饲料。此外，通过大辩论，涌现了许多善于安排家庭用粮的主妇，成为节约粮食的主力军。为了把节约粮食经常化，许多农业社还制定了具体的计划。
    万安县不少乡、社在社会主义大辩论以后，提出节约“一两米”的号召。人口较多的户，还作出了从现在到春耕短时期内的“一升米”、“两升米”、“三升米”的节约用粮计划。团结一社在大辩论开展后的第二天，90％的社员停止用大米喂猪；在这个一百一十户的社里，平均每户节约一到二升米。胜利一社社员陈志义，见全社早、中稻增产，晚稻和二季作物又生长良好，便向社要求分六百斤酒谷，经大辩论教育，将已分得的二百斤酒谷，自动向社退回一百斤。涧田社社员何肇九，过去猪婆生猪崽，要喂一个多月的白米煮粥，现改喂七天，其余用田塍白皮豆磨浆和南瓜混煮代用。常胜五社社员，现在积极收贮饲料。该社二队十九户社员，已晒干丝草一百七十七担，最多的户已收贮了二十五担。全县各地自留地的番薯藤，也都开始收贮晒干。号称“油米之乡”的枫林、沿江等乡，也都投入了节约运动。习惯做“荡米皮”（一种食品）的，过去每户至少做二斗米，多的上担米，现在都表示节约不做了。森林二社社员萧宏时并将正浸在水里准备做“汤糟”的二十五升早米，从水里滤出晒干做饭了。目前全县大部分乡、社、户都订立了增产节约计划，使增产节约运动经常化。全县扩种荞麦一万三千二百七十五亩。为更好的开辟明春饲料地，并代替部分主粮食用，全县预计扩种萝卜田一万二千余亩。
    进贤、莲花、安义、萍乡、上饶等县的社员们在分清了“国家统购粮不能减少”、“三定口粮够吃”的是非以后，纷纷将多分的口粮自动退出，并从各方面堵塞浪费漏洞，节约用粮。萍乡县崇源农业社，夏收分口粮时，每人多留了四十到六十斤，辩论结束后，社员们自动退出三万五千斤。安义县柏树社，全社二百七十一户，家家都以平均每人四百八十斤谷子为标准，根据季节闲忙，农活轻重，订出了用粮计划。进贤县新设乡为了做到用粮心中有数，有的社员煮饭时要过秤，小孩吃饭也按量，不留剩饭，淘米时不让米倒入馊桶，把碾谷改成砻谷，可多出些米。莲花县有七十一个社，节约粮食已形成社员们的自觉行动。坪里乡的五洲一分社，最近有五户人家办喜事，原来每户打算做八至十二桌酒席，订出节约粮食公约后，三家不做了。过去滥用粮食喂猪的人家，现在都尽量用薯藤、小薯根或者挖野菜来喂猪。
    这些县的乡社基层党员和干部，在节约粮食中，都起了积极带头作用，为群众树立了良好的榜样。安义县罗田乡京台三分社党员刘敦柳，一家七人，三定留粮是三千三百斤，去年分得口粮四千四百斤，吃不完，用粮做酒、做米粉、喂鸡，浪费了一千二百三十斤。辩论后，他自动把全家口粮减为三千一百七十斤，比三定留粮标准还少一百三十斤。党员刘怡庆，还对自己一家全年的用粮作了周密的安排，他家四人吃饭，三定留粮标准是一千九百五十斤，平均每月一百六十二斤半，他计划在11、12、1月这三个月每月只吃一百二十斤，节省下一百二十七斤半；2、3、9、10这四个月按三定标准吃；4、5、6、7、8这五个月农事较重，每月吃一百八十七斤。总起来，全年用粮只一千九百四十五斤，稍低于三定留粮标准。
