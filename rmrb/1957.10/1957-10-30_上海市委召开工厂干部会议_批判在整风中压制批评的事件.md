    Shanghai, October 29 (This newspaper reports) The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a meeting of factory cadres to criticize an erroneous incident in a factory rectification campaign where correct criticism from workers was suppressed. The individuals criticized were Zhu Fuhua, the Party Secretary of the Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Xinzhong Power Machine Factory, and other leading personnel.
    When the Xinzhong Power Machine Factory began its "blooming and contending," Wang Jianlan, a factory nurse, wrote three big-character posters in succession, exposing the erroneous behavior of Meng Qinghui, the factory's Party Organization Department Head, who brutally beat her because of a children's quarrel. These big-character posters aroused public indignation, and within a few days, more than one hundred big-character posters appeared. The masses also criticized the special privileges in the lifestyle of some leading cadres, believing that the factory's Party Secretary should not use a car for commuting. This criticism could have been resolved quickly with proper handling. However, some Party leaders in the factory adopted an erroneous attitude. Meng Qinghui, the Party Organization Department Head who was criticized, believed that this was "a deliberate attempt by bad elements to vilify the leadership," "an attack on the Party," and "making things difficult for me." Party Secretary Zhu Fuhua, Deputy Director Ji Ping, and others also made the same assessment and decided to launch a so-called "counterattack" against the masses' criticism. When this issue was discussed in the Party Committee meeting, some people suggested that criticisms from the masses should be corrected immediately if possible, to show the masses the leadership's determination to rectify. However, Party Secretary Zhu Fuhua and other leading cadres insisted on carrying out a "counterattack" against the masses' criticisms and held meetings to arrange this.
    Subsequently, they posted "counterattack" big-character posters. Many of these posters did not present facts or reason logically but simply used empty accusations, calling the other side "despicable and shameless," "fabricating stories out of thin air," "insidious and vicious," and so on. Meng Qinghui, the Party Organization Department Head, also wrote a several-thousand-word big-character poster, satirizing and ridiculing those who had criticized him. The big-character poster also demanded the dismissal of a staff member who had raised criticisms.
    This erroneous so-called "counterattack" aroused dissatisfaction among the workers. Some workers said, "What kind of rectification attitude is this!" Many workers who had written big-character posters criticizing the leading cadres were very nervous. Workers in the diesel engine workshop took out the drafts of their big-character posters and reviewed them again and again, fearing that there were mistakes and they would be "counterattacked." As a result, the enthusiasm of the workers to write big-character posters plummeted.
    The erroneous practice of the Xinzhong Power Machine Factory was quickly discovered by the leaders of the CPC Tilanqiao District Committee, who immediately stopped it and urged the factory's leading cadres to make self-criticisms and removed Party Secretary Zhu Fuhua from his position as the head of the rectification leadership group.

### 上海市委召开工厂干部会议  批判在整风中压制批评的事件

    上海市委召开工厂干部会议
    批判在整风中压制批评的事件
    本报上海29日电　中共上海市委在最近召开的一次工厂干部会议上，批判了一件工厂整风运动中错误的压服职工正确批评的事件。被批评的是公私合营新中动力机厂党委书记祝复华等部分领导人员。
    新中动力机厂在开始鸣放时，工厂护士王建兰连续写了三张大字报，揭发工厂的党委组织部长孟庆辉因小孩争吵而粗暴的殴打她等错误行为。这几张大字报贴出后，引起了群众的公愤，几天内出现了一百多张大字报。大字报上群众还批评了部分领导干部生活作风上的特殊化倾向，认为厂的党委书记上下班时不应当坐小汽车。这个批评，本来只要处理得当是很快就可以解决的。但该厂部分党的领导干部却采取了错误态度。受到批评的党委组织部长孟庆辉认为这是“坏分子有意丑化领导”，“向党进攻”，“与我为难”，党委书记祝复华、副厂长季平等也作了同样的估计，并决定对群众的批评来一个所谓“反击”。当这个问题在党委会讨论时，曾有人提出应当根据群众的批评能改的马上就改，以此向群众表明领导整风的决心，但是党委书记祝复华等部分领导干部仍坚持要对群众批评实行“反击”，并召开会议，进行布置。
    接着，他们便贴出了“反击”的大字报，许多大字报不摆事实，不讲道理，而只是空洞的斥骂对方“卑鄙无耻”、“无中生有”、“阴险毒辣”等等，党委组织部长孟庆辉也写了一张数千字的大字报，向曾对他批评的人讽刺挖苦了一顿。大字报上还要求撤销提出批评的一位工作人员的职务。
    这个错误的所谓“反击”，引起了职工们的不满，有的工人说：“这是什么整风态度！”许多写过大字报批评过领导干部的人，情绪都很紧张，柴油机车间的工人把写的大字报底稿拿出来看了又看，深怕有错，受到“反击”。这样，职工群众写大字报的热情就一落千丈。
    新中动力机厂的这个错误作法，很快就被中共提蓝桥区委领导上发现，当即制止了，并且督促该厂领导干部作了检讨，撤销了党委书记祝复华的整风领导组长职务。
