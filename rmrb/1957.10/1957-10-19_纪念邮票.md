　　Commemorative Stamps
    This newspaper reports: To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has specially invited artists to design a set of commemorative stamps entitled "The 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution," and has decided to issue them on November 7, 1957.
    This set of stamps consists of five stamps, with the serial number Ji 44. The image area is 23×32 mm, printed by intaglio engraving, with five face values. Four-fen stamps are bright red, eight-fen stamps are coffee-colored, twenty-fen stamps are emerald green, twenty-two-fen stamps are reddish-brown, and thirty-two-fen stamps are blue.
    Post and telecommunications bureaus in major cities will also use commemorative postmarks on that day. From the second day onwards, they will no longer be used on mail. However, applications from philatelists for cancellation of stamps for collection purposes can be extended until December 6th. (Attached picture)
