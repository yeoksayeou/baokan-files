Further Improve the Level of Track and Field

Meng Hua

The 1957 National Track and Field Championships opens today in Nanjing. Participating in this conference are twenty-seven delegations, with more than seven hundred and forty outstanding male and female athletes. Through this conference, China's track and field movement will be pushed to a new stage.

Track and field is a comprehensive sports project that includes many individual events. It has the value of comprehensively exercising the body and can be said to be the foundation of various sports projects. After liberation, track and field, like other sports projects, has seen rapid development and improvement under the care of the Party and the government.

Due to the broad mass base of track and field, a large number of talented athletes have emerged in recent years, and they have continuously broken China's track and field records. In the thirteen years of Kuomintang rule from 1936 to 1948, track and field records were only changed seven times. Since liberation, especially in recent years, the highest record of the previous year has been broken every year: seventy-two times in 1954, sixty-seven times in 1955, and one hundred and seventy-eight times in 1956. This year, in many international competitions, Chinese track and field athletes have begun to win glory for the motherland.

China's existing outstanding track and field athletes have all grown up under the cultivation of the Party and the government after liberation. They have a high degree of political awareness and a sense of responsibility to the motherland. They have excellent moral character and the habit of studying hard and practicing diligently. Moreover, they are all very young. According to statistics from fourteen master athletes and some first-class athletes, the average age is only twenty-two years old. After hard training, they will certainly not fail the expectations of the people of the motherland and create better results. In addition, our reserve force is strong. Nearly one-third of the existing graded athletes are at the juvenile level. Track and field classes have been set up in the youth amateur sports schools piloted in various places, absorbing a large number of young people to engage in track and field; sports colleges in various places are training a large number of technical talents for sports, and the State Sports Commission and sports commissions at all levels have also held training courses for track and field instructors and referees.

Although the level of our track and field has improved in recent years, it still cannot fully meet the needs of the masses to participate in track and field exercises due to our weak foundation before liberation. We cannot be complacent. In the rectification movement, and in long-term practice in the future, we must constantly overcome shortcomings, correct mistakes, and adopt various methods to develop track and field. We must do more publicity work, strengthen physical education in primary and secondary schools, especially develop track and field activities in middle schools, hold more grassroots competitions and juvenile competitions, train a large number of technical personnel, improve the training of athletes, and rapidly improve the technical level of track and field in our country on a mass basis.

    把田径运动水平再提高一步
    梦华
    1957年全国田径运动大会今天在南京开幕。参加这次大会的有二十七个代表队，七百四十多名优秀男女运动员。通过这次大会，将把我国田径运动推向新的阶段。
    田径运动是一个包括许多单项的综合运动项目，对人的身体有全面锻炼的价值，也可以说是各种运动项目的基础。解放后，田径运动和其它运动项目一样，在党和政府的关怀下，有着迅速的发展和提高。
    由于田径运动有了广泛的群众基础，几年来涌现了大批有才能的运动员，他们不断地刷新我国田径运动的纪录。在1936年到1948年国民党统治的十三年中，田径运动纪录只改变过七次。解放以后，尤其是最近几年，每年打破上年度最高纪录：1954年七十二次，1955年六十七次，1956年一百七十八次。今年在多次国际比赛中，我国的田径运动员开始为祖国赢得了荣誉。
    我国现有的田径优秀运动员都是解放以后在党和政府的培育下成长起来的。他们有高度的政治觉悟和对祖国的责任感，他们有优良的道德作风和勤学苦练的习惯。而且他们年纪都很轻，据十四个运动健将和一部分一级运动员的统计，平均年龄只有二十二岁。经过刻苦锻炼，他们一定不会辜负祖国人民的期望，创造出更好成绩。此外，我们的后备力量是雄厚的，现有等级运动员中近三分之一是少年级。各地试办的青少年业余体育学校中都设有田径班，吸收了大批青少年从事田径运动；各地体育院校为体育运动培养大批技术人才，国家体委和各级体委还举办了田径指导和裁判员的训练班。
    虽然我们的田径运动水平几年来有了提高，但由于我们解放前的基础薄弱，因而在目前的情况下，还不能充分满足广大群众要求参加田径运动锻炼的需要。我们不能自满，要在整风运动中，在今后长期实践中，不断克服缺点，纠正错误，采用各种方法开展田径运动。多作些宣传工作，加强中小学体育教学工作，特别是开展中学的田径活动，多举办基层竞赛活动，少年竞赛活动，大批地培养技术力量，改进运动员训练工作，在群众性的基础上，迅速地提高我国田径运动的技术水平。
