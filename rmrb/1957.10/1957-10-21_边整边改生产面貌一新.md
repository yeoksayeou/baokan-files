While Rectifying and Reforming, the Production Outlook Takes on a New Look

The members of the Fenjiang Agricultural Production Cooperative on the outskirts of Guangzhou put forward many good suggestions during the rectification campaign. The cooperative's cadres studied these suggestions and took various measures to actively improve the situation. Now the entire cooperative's production outlook has been completely renewed, and people are saying: The rectification campaign has brought good times!

"Wherever shortcomings are discovered, correct them there!" The tangerine orchard of the Second Production Team of the Fenjiang Cooperative was overgrown with weeds and had been neglected for a long time. During this period of great airing of views, the cooperative cadres immediately accepted the suggestion and sent workers to remove the weeds from the tangerine orchard.

The vegetable plots of the Fenjiang Cooperative in the past did not fully utilize their potential. Often, after the previous batch of vegetables was harvested, seedlings could not be planted in time. After this was raised by the members, this phenomenon was quickly changed. This is a picture of cooperative members rushing to plant seedlings. (Attached picture)

    边整边改生产面貌一新
    广州市郊凤江农业生产合作社社员们，在鸣放期间提出了许多好意见。社干部研究了这些意见，采取了各种措施，积极进行改进。现在全社生产面貌焕然一新，人们都说：鸣放带来了好光景！新华社记者  张家昌摄
    “那里发现缺点，就在那里纠正它！”凤江社第二生产队的桔子地野草丛生，过去有很长一个时期无人过问。这次在大鸣大放中，社干部立刻接受意见，派工到桔子地去除草。
    凤江社过去的菜地没有充分发挥利用率，往往在前一批的菜收获后，不能及时种上菜苗，经社员提出后，迅速改变了这种现象。这是社员在赶插菜苗。（附图片）
