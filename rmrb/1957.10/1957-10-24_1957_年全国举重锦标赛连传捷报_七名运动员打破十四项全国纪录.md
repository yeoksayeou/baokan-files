Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 23rd: Good news continues to pour in from the 1957 National Weightlifting Championships. This afternoon, Tianjin athlete Zhao Qingkui broke three national records in the light heavyweight class – total score, press, and snatch. His total score was 390 kg, exceeding his previous national record of 385 kg from last year by 5 kg.

    The muscular Zhao Qingkui attracted the most attention during the competition. In his second attempt in the press, he lifted 122.5 kg, breaking the national record of 120 kg held by Li Baiyu. In his second attempt in the snatch, he lifted 120 kg, also breaking his own national record of 117.5 kg. Zhao Qingkui, who won the light heavyweight championship, achieved 150 kg in the clean and jerk.

    Li Baiyu, China's first middle heavyweight weightlifter to surpass 400 kg in total score, broke four more national records in Guangzhou tonight. He achieved a new national best of 415 kg. This not only improves last year's national record by a full 57.5 kg, but also surpasses his performance at the Third International Youth Friendship Games in early August this year, where he placed fourth in the middle heavyweight competition, by 7.5 kg. It also exceeds the fifth-place result of 407.5 kg at last year's Olympic Games.

    Li Baiyu's scores today were 132.5 kg in the press, 122.5 kg in the snatch, and 160 kg in the clean and jerk, all significantly exceeding the national records – 112.5 kg in the press, 105 kg in the snatch, and 145 kg in the clean and jerk.

    Xiao Shanzu, a People's Liberation Army athlete who won second place in the middle heavyweight competition, achieved a total score of 342.5 kg, with 113 kg in the press, also breaking his own national record.

    The heavyweight weightlifters, weighing over 90 kg, failed to break any national records in their competition tonight. Chang Guanqun, the previous national record holder, won first place with a total score of 365 kg, but this was 12.5 kg less than the national record.

    The National Weightlifting Championships have now concluded. The closing ceremony will be held tomorrow evening, where the team scores will be announced.
