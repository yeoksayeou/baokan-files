　　On Prospering Art Creation and Specialization
　　Wang Chaowen
    Jiang Feng, a rightist element in the art world, not only opposed the Party's literary and art policies, but also betrayed the Marxist-Leninist principles of literature and art in his remarks on issues such as prospering creation and improving the quality of creation.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" called on writers and artists to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly, which is the Party's principle for literature and art. Creating for the benefit of the people rather than for the individual interests of artists is the purpose of prospering creation and the path to prospering creation. There should be no other purpose and no other path. To achieve this goal, it requires the leadership and supervision of the Party, the education and encouragement of the masses, and the individual efforts of the artists. However, Jiang Feng, who firmly opposed the Party's "Hundred Flowers Blooming" policy for prospering creation, emphasized bourgeois-style individual struggle and wanted to separate literature and art from their position as "cogs and screws" in the revolutionary machine.
    Jiang Feng openly argued at the Central Academy of Fine Arts that the key to the lack of prosperity in China's art creation lies in the lack of specialization among artists. He said that when artists receive salaries in their work units and have a guaranteed livelihood, they become lazy and do not work hard to create. Once they become specialized, they will be like the artists in Shanghai during the Kuomintang rule, who had to engage in production to avoid starvation, and creation would be able to prosper. Jiang Feng even boasted about Wang Zhijie, a graduate who disobeyed organizational assignments and became specialized, saying how rich and comfortable his life was. He even called on students to compete freely like capitalists producing commodities, even selling their labor on the streets to draw portraits for people. These words aroused dissatisfaction, suspicion, and concern among the students, and even shook the originally not very solid belief of some in serving the people.
    Specialization and prospering creation can be consistent and should not be generally opposed. Comrade Lu Dingyi told us at the meeting to criticize the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique that old writers with cultivation and experience can specialize. The specialization of young people who are not yet mature in all aspects is harmful to the revolutionary cause and to the young people themselves. Premature specialization is equivalent to separating flowers and plants from the soil, preventing them from growing. Similarly, the growth of young artists should not rely on specialization but should be under the leadership and supervision of the Party, following Chairman Mao's instructions, to invest themselves in the fiery struggle of the masses for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to closely integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, transform their thinking, and develop their ability to understand and reflect life. Only in this way can they become truly talented artists and creatively use various special forms of art to influence the people with correct ideas and healthy emotions, promote the unity of the people, and encourage the people's enthusiasm for building socialism.
    We do not forgive some artists who do not engage in labor because their lives are guaranteed. It is obviously not glorious to be satisfied with the position of parasites who exploit the labor of others, consuming the fruits of others' labor while not providing products that benefit the people. But we also do not want to go back to the past, allowing poverty and hunger to hinder rather than prosper our creation.
    The life situation of painters in capitalist society, such as burning their manuscripts, which were soaked with their own painstaking effort, for warmth, using street corner lamplight to carve woodcuts, and engaging in production with the faces of art dealers as the yardstick, don't know how many geniuses were buried, what is there to be nostalgic for? Including Rembrandt, who Jiang Feng also admired, if not for poverty, they would have left us with more good works, and more great painters would have appeared in history.
    This kind of life situation is what artists in capitalist countries are trying to get rid of but find difficult to get rid of. But Jiang Feng regarded it as a driving force for prospering creation. Our new society does not allow Jiang Feng to artificially create difficulties, nor does it allow Jiang Feng to use this to distort the social life of the new society. Jiang Feng's idea of "poetry improves with poverty" is contrived and unfounded. If the strategy of Xiang Yu of the Warring States period's "fighting with one's back to the river" was a last resort, and the method of "placing soldiers in a death trap and then living" was a last resort, then what need is there for artists living in the organized, planned, and unified working conditions of the Party's literary and art cause to artificially create difficulties in this regard?
    It is meaningless to discuss issues with Jiang Feng in this way because his central intention is not here. Jiang Feng's advocacy of individual struggle and the bourgeois free competition mode of production is aimed at opposing the Party's leadership and supervision of literature and art, splitting us from the overall Party's literary and art cause, making us a tool for the personal ambitionist Jiang Feng to oppose the Party, becoming Jiang Feng's capital to satisfy his desire for leadership, and becoming Jiang Feng's reserve force to contend with the Party.
    Creating for money and being paid because of creation are two things of different natures and two different purposes of action. Serving the people and creating for Renminbi (RMB) are the distinctions between artists and profit-seeking merchants. Creating for money cannot prosper revolutionary creation. Perhaps, money can make ghosts work; hasn't Marx said, "Money can turn virtue into vice, and vice into virtue"? However, money cannot bring creative raw materials to conscientious artists, nor can it bring creative inspiration and creative joy. Although we are not satisfied with today's social life, we are very happy that we have already gotten rid of the situation described in the "Communist Manifesto," where the bourgeoisie regarded artists as servants hired with money. Unexpectedly, Jiang Feng, a Communist Party member, in order to confuse people so as to expand his anti-Party forces, openly praised capitalism, which was cursed by revolutionary teachers.
    In today's art world, there are indeed some people whose actions echo Jiang Feng's calls. In addition to Wang Zhijie, whom Jiang Feng praised, there are also Shen Tongheng and Xiao Li, whom everyone knows. These people who have broken away from the organization and are engaged in individual struggle have not only specialized, but are also taking the old bourgeois road that Jiang Feng praised. In order to make more money, they plagiarize other people's works and submit one manuscript to several publications; they compete for the market like merchants and attack each other. These behaviors, which do not even have basic self-esteem, are at least not worthy of praise. Whether the painter's soul is noble or despicable will determine the success or failure of the work. Even if painters with corrupt thoughts and a desire for profit do not draw anti-Party and anti-socialist cartoons, how can they produce creations that are truly conducive to the unity and progress of the people? Just like He Chi, who promoted creation for the petty bourgeoisie and promoted the petty bourgeoisie's low-level tastes in order to make more money, and just like Liu Shaotang, who revised his novels and published them again and again in order to make more money, the road of Wang Zhijie and other so-called artists is definitely not to be taken. They cannot prosper creation, they can only destroy creation. Since they treat creation according to bourgeois ideas, their practice can only deepen and develop bourgeois ideas. Jiang Feng's specialization, which he advocated to be free from the Party's leadership and supervision in order to oppose the Party, like the periodicals and painting societies that he advocated to be free from the Party's leadership and supervision in order to oppose the Party, is not conducive to the revolutionary cause and will only harm artists who are unwilling to fall into the bourgeois quagmire.
    Jiang Feng's important reason for advocating specialization is for the freedom of creation. In Jiang Feng's view, the Party's leadership and supervision are not a guarantee of the artist's freedom of creation; on the contrary, it hinders the artist's freedom of creation, so he called on students to "each break out a path." This is an unworkable idea and a distortion of our social life. Today, what unreasonable obstacles have the artist's freedom of creation been subjected to? Aren't many artists who have achieved some success encouraged by the Party and achieved more success because they have been cultivated by the Party? Some of them have become arrogant and, at critical moments, repay kindness with hatred and attack the Party.
    Lenin believed that socialist literature is the most free literature because it gets rid of the dependence on money. Jiang Feng, however, wants people to rely on money and break away from the Party's leadership and supervision. Why is it said that socialist literature is the most free literature? The meaning of this sentence not only means that writers and artists get rid of the control of money, but also means that they get rid of the bourgeois individualistic thoughts that exist in the artists themselves.
    Creating for personal fame and gain, its purpose is humble, and therefore it is not free. Is it possible to talk about real creative freedom when you are worried about gains and losses and looking before and after for personal interests? Moreover, the feeling of freedom is also based on the understanding of reality. If artists cannot grasp the inevitability of historical development and lack the initiative to reflect what and how to reflect, how can they feel the true freedom of creation? Only when artists take the initiative to eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish correct standpoints and viewpoints can they take the initiative to understand the inevitability of historical development and correctly handle the relationship between the subjective and the objective in creative practice; neither naturalistically taking pictures of reality, nor distorting reality with imagination and fiction. However, Jiang Feng fears that the ghost of bourgeois ideology will leave us too quickly, and insists on guiding artists back to the old capitalist road that makes people unfree.
    Prospering creation is of course not just an increase in quantity, but also an improvement in quality. Paper flowers can never replace real flowers. This is something that everyone understands and does not need to be discussed. And improving quality can only be achieved by closely integrating with the working people in accordance with the principles instructed by Chairman Mao. Only when artists feel that the purpose of serving politics and expressing emotions are harmonious and consistent can the ideological and artistic aspects of creation be unified. If the ideology is reactionary and the emotions are decadent, even if he understands some knowledge about creation and learns some oil painting techniques, it is difficult to avoid revealing unhealthy emotions. It is easy to judge whether the quality of works with unhealthy emotions is high or low. Everyone felt that the works exhibited by the rightist Wang Liuqiu at the "August 1st" exhibition had an unusually dark mood and were very lacking in optimism. It is obvious that even if it depicts the life of the people, if the artist's ideology is reactionary, it cannot guarantee that the work has a higher quality or that it does not reveal dark and poisonous emotions. Just as accurate and skilled techniques cannot guarantee the quality of the work.
    Jiang Feng also does not oppose improving the quality of creation, but Jiang Feng's standard for improving quality is bourgeois and violates the principles put forward by Chairman Mao. Jiang Feng repeatedly and arbitrarily believed that the central problem currently existing in the art world is to improve technology. In the Party group of the Artists Association, Jiang Feng openly clamored: Even the artists who have grown up in the revolutionary ranks are unwilling to listen to your set (the important thing he said about that set is to go deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers and transform their thinking), they want to listen to the oil painters about the knowledge of oil painting technology. What they urgently need is not great principles, but technology. In 1954, Jiang Feng and I went to the East China Branch of the Academy of Fine Arts to participate in a symposium. At the meeting, a teacher openly asked me: "I heard that you oppose learning technology, do you oppose learning technology?" It seems that going deep into life and understanding life have irreconcilable contradictions with mastering technology, and it seems that as long as you oppose neglecting the former, you don't want the latter. Technology is something that you can't finish learning even if you learn until you are old, and you must learn it seriously; but you must also put it in its proper place in artistic creation. It is wrong to regard technology as higher than everything else or to mystify it, which cannot correctly explain the process of artistic creation, this spiritual production, nor can it explain the relationship between technology and various other conditions in creation. The accuracy and skill of technology are precious, but it is only equivalent to the pronunciation and rhetoric of speaking, and it should not be used to replace the content of speaking, mystifying technology.
    One of the problems we often encounter is the "generalization" of creation. Is it because of a lack of technology that it cannot be reflected as smoothly as possible? Or is it because you can't stand higher than reality, can't see the characteristics of the reality in development, can't see the constantly changing human character? Every artist has his own special and specific situation. But we know that if artists lack correct standpoints and viewpoints, at most they passively accept some things in reality and cannot actively discover some things; even if they have a higher technical level, they cannot effectively overcome "generalization." Therefore, it is said that life is the source of creation, and the artist's world outlook is the soul of creation. Jiang Feng does not completely fail to understand this very ordinary truth, but is blinded by his bourgeois ideology and instead thinks that the world outlook hinders creation.
    If the pedestrian crosswalk on the road is the object of description, and Wang Liuqiu's dissatisfaction with the pedestrian crosswalk is the work, then, is it a technical problem to say that the measures that are beneficial to the safety of the majority are things that hinder his freedom? No. If the anti-counterrevolutionary movement is the object of description, and Jiang Feng's remarks of dissatisfaction with it are the work, then, is it a question of the level of technology? Definitely not. Because his ideology is reactionary, he distortedly described the necessary measures to defend the people's democratic dictatorship. Just like Ding Ling's novel "In the Hospital" wrote about worker-peasant cadres as ignorant, selfish, hypocritical, and cold, without any ideals, and just like Liu Shaotang's novel "Xiyuan Grass" described loyal and wholeheartedly serving the people of the regiment cadres as rigid, ruthless, and unworthy of being a romantic object, this is the degeneration of art, this is a shameful betrayal. We do not allow Jiang Feng's anti-Party creation to prosper, because if this kind of creation continues to prosper, it will bring serious harm to the people and hinder the progress of society, let alone the prosperity of socialist art. Whoever supports Jiang Feng's anti-Party "creation" again must be rejected by the people.
    The lesson learned from Jiang Feng's anti-Party phenomenon proves the importance of one aspect that we need to improve - the transformation of ideology. Opposing the Party's literary and art policy in the name of opposing dogmatism cannot guide artists to actively participate in the great cause of transforming the world and transforming people, nor can it improve the quality of creation.

　　谈谈繁荣美术创作和专业化
　　王朝闻
    美术界右派分子江丰，不只是反对党的文艺政策，而且关于繁荣创作、提高创作质量等问题的言论，也背叛了马克思列宁主义的文学艺术原则。
    毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，号召文学家、艺术家全心全意为工农兵服务，就是党的文学艺术原则。为人民的利益创作而不是为艺术家个人利益创作，才是繁荣创作的目的，才是繁荣创作的道路。再不应有别的目的，也不应有别的道路。为了达到这一目的，只有在党的领导和监督之下，在群众的教育和鼓舞之下，加上艺术家个人的努力。可是坚决反对党繁荣创作的“百花齐放”方针的江丰，强调的是资产阶级式的个人奋斗，是要文艺从革命的机器中的“齿轮和螺丝钉”的地位中分离出来。
    江丰在中央美术学院公开认为，我国的美术创作不繁荣，关键在于美术家没有专业化。美术家在工作单位领工薪，生活有了保障，人就变懒惰了，不努力创作了。一旦专业化了，就会像国民党统治时期在上海的艺术家那样，因为穷，要避免挨饿，不得不从事生产，创作就能够繁荣了。江丰甚至为不服从组织分配、专业化了的毕业生汪志杰吹嘘，说他怎样有钱，生活舒服。而且号召同学们像资本家生产商品一样自由竞争，甚至到马路上零卖劳动力，为人画像。这些话引起了同学们的不满，怀疑，顾虑，甚至动摇了一些人本来就没有十分巩固的为人民服务的信念。
    专业化和繁荣创作，可以是不矛盾的；所以不应该一般地加以反对。陆定一同志在批判丁、陈反党集团的大会上告诉我们：有修养有经验的老作家，可以专业化。各方面还很不成熟的青年专业化，对于革命事业和青年人本身都是有害的。过早地专业化，等于是要花草脱离土壤，得不到生长。同样的，青年美术家的成长，不应该靠专业化而是应该在党的领导和监督之下，按照毛主席的指示，长期地、无条件地、全心身地投入到群众火热的斗争中去，与工农兵密切结合，改造思想，锻炼认识生活和反映生活的能力。这样才能成为真正有才能的美术家，才有可能创造性地使用美术的各种特殊形式，用正确的思想和健康的感情来影响人民，促进人民的团结，鼓舞人民建设社会主义的热情。
    我们不原谅某些因为生活有保障而不从事劳动的美术家。满足于剥削别人劳动的寄生者的地位，消耗别人的劳动成果，自己却不提供有利于人民的生产品，显然是不光荣的。可是我们也不愿意走回头路，让穷困和饥饿来妨碍而不是繁荣我们的创作。
    资本主义社会中的画家，那种把浸透了自己心血的画稿当柴烧来取暖的生活状况，那种借用街角落的路灯来刻木刻的生活状况，那种以画商的脸色为尺度而从事制作的生活状况，不知道葬送了多少天才，这有什么值得留恋的？包括江丰也推崇的林布兰在内，如果不是因为穷困，他们将给我们留下更多的好作品，历史上也将出现更多的大画家。
    这种生活状况，是目前资本主义国家的美术家想摆脱而难于摆脱的。可是江丰却当成是繁荣创作的推动力。我们的新社会不容许江丰人工地制造困难，也不容许江丰借此对新社会的社会生活进行歪曲。江丰这种“诗穷而后工”的主张，是矫揉造作的，没有根据的。如果说战国时代的项羽的“背水战”的战略是不得已的，把士兵“置之死地而后生”的办法是不得已的，那末，生活在有组织的、有计划的、统一的党的文艺事业工作条件中的美术家，有什么必要在这一点上人工地制造困难呢？
    和江丰这样来讨论问题是没有意义的；因为他说话的中心意图不在这儿。江丰鼓吹个人奋斗，鼓吹资产阶级的自由竞赛的生产方式，目的不过是反对党对文学艺术的领导和监督，使我们从党的文艺事业的整体之中分裂出来，成为个人野心家江丰的反党工具，成为江丰满足其领袖欲的资本，成为江丰和党分庭抗礼的后备力量。
    为了金钱而创作，和因为有了创作而得到报酬，是性质不同的两件事，是两种不同的行动目的。为人民服务和为人民币而创作，是艺术家与唯利是图的商人之间的区别之所在。为了金钱而创作，不能繁荣革命的创作。也许，钱可以通神，可以使得鬼推磨；马克思不是说过，“钱可以使美德变成恶行，恶行变成美德”吗？可是，钱不能给有良心的艺术家带来创作的原料，也不能带来创作的灵感和创作的喜悦。我们虽然不以今天的社会生活为满足，我们却很高兴，已经摆脱了“共产党宣言”中所说的，资产阶级把艺术家当成用钱雇佣的仆役。想不到身为共产党员的江丰，为了使人们被他迷惑，以便扩大他的反党势力，公然歌颂早被革命导师所诅咒过的资本主义。
    今天的美术界，确实有一些人的行动和江丰的号召相呼应。除了江丰所称赞过的汪志杰，还有大家知道的沈同衡、萧里，这些脱离组织的，个人奋斗的人，不但专业化了，而且走的正是江丰所称赞的资产阶级的老路。他们为了多赚钱而抄袭别人的作品，一稿数投；像商人一样争夺市场，互相攻击。这些连起码的自尊心都没有的行为，至少是不值得称赞的。画家的灵魂是高尚，是卑鄙，将决定作品的成败。思想腐败唯利是图的画家，即令他们不画反党、反社会主义的漫画，又怎能生产真正有利于人民的团结和进步的创作呢？正如为了多赚钱而提倡为小市民创作、宣传小市民低级趣味的何迟一样，正如为了多赚钱而把自己的小说改头换面一再出版的刘绍棠一样，汪志杰等这些所谓美术家的道路，不论如何是走不得的。他们不能繁荣创作，只能毁灭创作。既然按照资产阶级的思想来对待创作，他们的实践只能加深和发展资产阶级的思想。江丰为了反党而提倡的脱离党的领导和监督的专业化，如同他为了反党而提倡的脱离党的领导和监督的同人刊物和画会一样，不利于革命事业，只会损害不甘堕落到资产阶级泥坑的美术家。
    江丰提倡专业化的重要理由，是为了创作的自由。在江丰看来，党的领导和监督，不是美术家创作自由的保证，相反地它要妨碍美术家的创作自由，所以他才号召学生“各人去闯一条路”。这是行不通的主张，也是对我们社会生活的一种歪曲。今天，美术家的创作自由受到了什么不合理的妨碍呢？多少有一些成绩就得到了党的鼓励的许多美术家，不是因为受到党的培养而有了更多成绩吗？其中有一些人反而骄傲，在紧要关头，以怨报德，向党进攻呢。
    列宁认为：社会主义的文学是最自由的文学，因为它摆脱了金钱的依赖。江丰却要人们依赖金钱，脱离党的领导和监督。为什么说社会主义的文学是最自由的文学？这句话的意义，还不只意味着文艺家摆脱了金钱的控制，而且还意味着摆脱了存在于艺术家本身的，资产阶级个人主义的思想。
    为个人的名利而创作，其目的是卑微的，因而也就是不自由的。为个人的利益而患得患失和顾前顾后，谈得到真正的创作自由吗？而且，自由的感觉也基于对现实的认识。艺术家如果不能掌握历史发展的必然性，缺乏反映什么和怎样反映的主动性，怎能够感到创作的真正自由？艺术家只有主动地清除资产阶级思想，建立了正确的立场观点，才有可能主动地认识历史发展的必然性，才能够在创作实践中处理主观与客观的正确关系；既不是自然主义地给现实照像，而且想像和虚构也不会歪曲现实。可是江丰唯恐资产阶级思想这一鬼魂太快地离开我们，偏偏要引导美术家回返到使人不自由的资本主义的老路。
    繁荣创作当然不只是数量的增加，同时也应该是质量的提高。纸花决不能代替真花。这是大家了解，不必讨论的。而提高质量，也只有按照毛主席指示我们的原则，和劳动人民密切结合。只有艺术家感到为政治服务的目的和抒发感情是和谐一致的，创作的思想性和艺术性才能够是统一的。如果思想反动，感情颓废，即令他懂得一些有关创作的知识，学会了一些油画技术，也难免流露出不健康的情感。感情不健康的作品，其质量是高的还是低的很容易判断。右派分子王流秋在“八一”展出的作品，大家感到情调异常阴暗，非常缺乏乐观主义的精神。很明显：即使描绘了人民的生活，要是作画人的思想反动，也不能保证作品有较高的质量，不流露阴暗的有毒的感情。正如准确和熟练的技术不能保证作品的质量一样。
    江丰也不反对提高创作的质量，可是江丰提高质量的标准，是资产阶级的，是违反毛主席所提出的方针的。江丰一再武断地认为：美术界当前存在的中心问题，是提高技术。在美协党组，江丰公开叫嚣：连革命队伍中成长起来的美术家也不愿意听你们那一套了（他所说的那一套，就是深入工农兵和改造思想的重要），他们要听的是油画家关于油画技术的知识了。他们迫切需要的不是大道理，是技术。1954年我同江丰到美术学院华东分院参加了一个座谈会。会上有一位教师公开问我：“听说你反对学技术，你是不是反对学技术？”似乎，深入生活和认识生活与掌握技术有不可解决的矛盾，似乎，只要反对忽视前者就是不要后者。技术，是学到老也学不完的，必须认真学习；可是也必须把它在艺术创作上的地位摆好。把技术看得高于一切或神秘化是不对的，不能正确解释艺术创作这一精神生产的过程，也不能解释在创作上技术和其他各种条件的关系。技术的准确性和熟练性是可宝贵的，可是它也不过相当于说话的发声和修词，不应该以它来代替说话的内容，把技术神秘化。
    我们常常接触到的问题之一，创作的“一般化”。究竟是因为缺乏技术才不能得心应手地加以反映呢？还是因为不能站得比现实更高，不能看出发展中的现实的特征之所在，不能看出不断变化的人的性格？每一个艺术家有其特殊的具体情况。可是我们知道：要是艺术家缺乏正确的立场、观点，至多是在现实中被动地接受一些东西，不可能主动地发现一些东西；即令有了较高技术修养，也不能有效克服“一般化”。所以说生活是创作的源泉，艺术家的世界观是创作的灵魂。江丰不是完全不理解这极普通的道理，可是被他的资产阶级思想所蒙蔽，反而以为世界观妨碍了创作。
    如果说马路上的人行横道线是描写的对象，王流秋对人行横道线的不满是作品，那么，把有利多数人的安全的措施说成是妨碍他的自由的东西，这是技术问题吗？不是。如果说肃反运动是描写的对象，江丰对它不满的言论是作品，那么，是技术高低的问题吗？决不是。因为他思想反动，所以才把保卫人民民主专政的必要措施加以歪曲的描写。如同丁玲的小说“在医院中”把工农干部写成愚昧无知、自私自利、虚伪而冷酷、没有任何理想一样，如同刘绍棠的小说“西苑草”把忠心耿耿、全心全意为人民服务的团干部描写成为头脑僵化、冷酷无情、作为恋爱对象也不配的人一样，这是艺术的堕落，这是可耻的叛变。我们不容许江丰反党的创作繁荣，因为这种创作再繁荣下去，就会给人民带来严重的损害，就会阻碍社会的前进，更不用说社会主义艺术的繁荣。谁要是再支持江丰反党的“创作”，他自己也一定要遭到人民的唾弃。
    由江丰反党这一现象得来的教训，证明我们需要提高的一个方面——思想的改造的重要性。借反对教条主义为名而反对党的文艺方针，不能引导美术家积极参加改造世界和改造人的伟大事业，也不可能提高创作的质量。
