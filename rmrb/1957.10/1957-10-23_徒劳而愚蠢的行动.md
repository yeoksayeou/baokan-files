    Futile and Foolish Actions
    By the Editorial Board
    Recently, after talks between representatives of the governments of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and the German Democratic Republic in Belgrade, a communiqué was issued on October 15 announcing the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries. The establishment of diplomatic relations between Yugoslavia and the GDR is a new development in the friendly and cooperative relations between socialist countries. This action by Yugoslavia clearly conforms to the interests of strengthening international cooperation and promoting the peaceful reunification of Germany.
    However, this legitimate diplomatic action by Yugoslavia in exercising its sovereignty has been met with hostility by Western countries and the West German government. They have issued threats to Yugoslavia, even unreasonably demanding that Yugoslavia pay attention to the so-called "regrettable consequences" that may arise. With the support of the United States, Britain, and France, the West German government unilaterally announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia on the 19th, in an arbitrary manner rarely seen in international practice.
    The unreasonable attitude adopted by the West German government, as pointed out by diplomats in Washington, marks a major diplomatic setback for the West German government and its allies. For several years, the West German government, encouraged and supported by countries such as the United States, Britain, and France, has posed as the "only German government qualified to speak for the whole of Germany," stubbornly refusing to recognize the existence of the German Democratic Republic and demanding that other countries not recognize it either. This practice by the West German government is inseparable from the policy of the Western countries' governments and the Adenauer group to maintain the division of Germany and the tense situation in Europe. They vainly attempt to eventually incorporate the German Democratic Republic into the Federal Republic of Germany. However, the facts of the past few years have proved that their attempt to belittle and exclude the German Democratic Republic internationally has completely failed. The German Democratic Republic exists and is developing. Its international influence is growing. Recently, even West German Foreign Minister Brentano had to admit that dozens of countries will sooner or later establish diplomatic relations with the GDR. However, the ruling groups of West Germany and other Western countries are like the blind, unable or unwilling to see this fact, and are still trying to prevent the further growth of the GDR's international influence. The West German government recently announced that any country that maintains diplomatic relations with West Germany would have its diplomatic ties severed by the West German government if it recognized the German Democratic Republic. The Adenauer government attempts to use this desperate method to save its policy of non-recognition, which is facing a crisis. However, Yugoslavia insists on an independent foreign policy and ignores this absurd warning from the West German government. This is why the West German and U.S., British, and French officials are particularly annoyed by Yugoslavia's action.
    The West German government's severance of diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia and the support expressed by the United States, Britain, France, and other countries for this decision by the West German government show that they insist on obstructing the peaceful reunification of Germany and maintaining the tense situation in Europe. As everyone knows, under the current circumstances in which there are actually two Germanys with different systems, the reunification of Germany can only be resolved through consultations between the two Germanys. And the restoration of Germany as a peaceful and democratic country will greatly benefit the peace of Europe. The West German and U.S., British, and French governments' non-recognition of the existence of the German Democratic Republic and their denial of the legitimate interests represented by the government of the GDR can only exacerbate the tense relations between East and West Germany, thereby deepening the division of Germany.
    The support of the United States and other Western countries for the West German government's severance of diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia also reflects the serious anxiety felt by the imperialist aggressive bloc about the current international situation. Due to the Soviet Union's success in intercontinental ballistic missiles and the launch of the first artificial satellite, the West's "policy of strength" has suffered a heavy blow. This situation has further expanded the influence of the principle of peaceful coexistence. Public opinion in West Germany is also increasingly inclined towards peaceful coexistence. The West German newspaper "Die Welt" said that it hopes "the West will realize that coexistence is not the worst thing." In order to save the bankruptcy of the "policy of strength," the imperialist forces are trying their best to create tense situations around the world. Worsening relations between West Germany and Yugoslavia is in line with their policy. However, the support of the United States and other Western countries for the West German government's severance of diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia is unpopular even within West Germany. Various political parties in West Germany, including many prominent figures within Adenauer's own Christian Democratic Union, strongly oppose the West German government's drastic action. According to foreign news agencies, the West German government's decision failed to gain the support of parliament.
    Facts will prove that the unrealistic policy pursued by Western countries and the West German government will not only have no effect, but will also isolate them among the German people and the people of the world.

    徒劳而愚蠢的行动
    本报评论员
    最近，南斯拉夫联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国两国政府代表在贝尔格莱德举行会谈之后，于10月15日发表公报，决定在两国之间建立正常的外交关系。南斯拉夫和民主德国的建交，是社会主义国家之间友好合作关系的新的发展。南斯拉夫的这个行动，显然符合于加强国际合作和促进德国和平统一的利益。
    但是南斯拉夫这个行使自己主权的正当的外交行动，却遭到了西方国家和西德政府的敌视。它们向南斯拉夫发出威胁，甚至蛮横无理地要南斯拉夫注意所谓可能引起的“令人遗憾的后果”。在美、英、法三国的支持之下，西德政府在19日以国际惯例上少有的专横态度片面地宣布断绝和南斯拉夫的外交关系。
    西德政府采取这样一种无理的态度，正像华盛顿的外交家们所指出的，是标志着西德政府和它的盟国受到了一次巨大的外交挫败。几年来，西德政府得到美、英、法等国家的鼓励和支持，以“有资格代表全德国讲话的唯一德国政府”自居，而顽固地不承认民主德国的存在，并且要其他国家都不予承认。西德政府的这个作法，是同西方国家政府和阿登纳集团力图保持德国的分裂和欧洲的紧张局势的政策分不开的。它们妄想最终能把德意志民主共和国并入德意志联邦共和国。但是几年来的事实证明，它们想在国际上贬低和排斥德意志民主共和国的打算是完全落空了。德意志民主共和国存在着和发展着。它的国际影响日益扩大。最近，连西德外交部长勃伦塔诺也不得不承认：现在有几十个国家将迟早跟民主德国建立外交关系。但是，西德和其他西方国家的统治集团都像瞎子一样，看不见或不愿意看见这一事实，仍力图阻止民主德国国际影响的进一步增长。西德政府不久以前宣布，同西德保有外交关系的任何国家，若承认德意志民主共和国，西德政府就要同它断绝邦交。阿登纳政府企图用这种穷凶极恶的办法，来挽救面临危机的不承认政策。但是南斯拉夫坚持自主的外交政策，不理睬西德政府这种荒唐的警告。这也就是为什么西德和美、英、法等官方对南斯拉夫这一行动感到特别恼怒的缘故。
    西德政府断绝跟南斯拉夫的外交关系和美、英、法等国对西德政府这一决定所表示的支持表明，它们坚持阻挠德国和平统一，维持欧洲紧张局势的立场。大家知道，在目前实际上存在两个不同制度的德国的情况下，要使德国重新统一，就只能通过两个德国之间的协商来解决。而德国恢复统一成为和平民主的国家，将大大有利于欧洲的和平。西德和美、英、法政府不承认德意志民主共和国的存在，否认民主德国政府所代表的合法利益，这只能加剧东西德之间的紧张关系，从而加深德国的分裂。
    美国和其他西方国家支持西德政府跟南斯拉夫断绝外交关系，还反映了帝国主义侵略集团对当前国际局势所感到的严重不安。由于苏联在洲际弹道导弹方面的成功和第一颗人造卫星的发射，西方的“实力政策”遭到了沉重的打击。这种形势使得和平共处原则的影响更加扩大。西德国内的舆论也日益倾向于和平共处。西德“世界报”就说，希望“西方将认识到共处并不是一件最坏的事情”。为了挽救“实力政策”的破产，帝国主义势力极力在世界各地制造紧张局势。使西德和南斯拉夫的关系恶化，是符合于它们的这个政策的。但是，美国和其他西方国家支持西德政府同南斯拉夫断绝外交关系的这种做法，甚至在西德内部也是不得人心的。西德各个政党，包括阿登纳自己的基督教民主联盟内许多著名人士都强烈反对西德政府采取这种断然的行动。据外国通讯社报道，西德政府的决定没有能得到议会的支持。
    事实将证明，西方国家和西德政府执行的这种不现实的政策，不仅不会有什么效果，而且将使它们自己在德国人民和世界人民中间孤立起来。
