The days the people of Lüda spent with the Soviet army were filled with countless unforgettable stories of friendship. The story of the Soviet military doctor who saved Wang Xianglan and her daughter is just one of them.

　　In January 1953, Wang Xianglan, a saleswoman at the Xinkai Road Department Store in Lüda City, went to Lushun to visit her parents-in-law while seven months pregnant. Unfortunately, she became seriously ill and her life was in danger. After diagnosis, it was believed that at most only one of the mother and child could be saved. If a cesarean section was not performed in time, both lives would be at risk. However, the local hospital lacked gynecologists at the time. Wang Xianglan's family was desperate, but luckily they found Soviet military naval hospital gynecologist, Naima Kaoen. Dr. Naima Kaoen, knowing that a Chinese woman was in emergency labor, braved the severe cold and snow late at night and rushed to the hospital. At that time, Wang Xianglan was breathing weakly and her life was in danger. Dr. Naima Kaoen did her best, performed a cesarean section, and saved both mother and daughter. Under the kind care of Dr. Naima Kaoen and the Chinese medical staff, Wang Xianglan and her daughter recovered for forty days and were discharged from the hospital healthy. When they returned home, her parents-in-law cried with gratitude. In order to never forget Dr. Naima Kaoen's life-saving grace, the whole family named the girl "Suhua" to express the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

　　This year, Suhua is already four and a half years old, and she is growing up so strong and lovely. She often asks her mother: Where are the Soviet military uncles? When I grow up, I must go and see the uncles.

　　Although the Soviet army has withdrawn from Lüda for more than two years, the people of Lüda are constantly reminiscing about them and are grateful to them. (Attached pictures)

    “苏华”的故事
    旅大人民和苏联军队相处的日子里，有数不清的令人难忘的友谊的故事。苏军军医救活王湘兰母女的故事，不过是其中的一件。
    1953年1月，旅大市新开路百货商店营业员王湘兰，在怀孕七个月时，到旅顺去探望公婆，不幸得了急病，性命危殆。经诊断认为母子两人至多能救活一个，如不及时作剖腹取胎手术，母子的性命都很危险。但当时当地医院缺乏妇科医生，王湘兰家属急得没有办法，后来幸好找到了苏军海军医院的妇科医生那意玛考恩。那意玛考恩医生知道是中国妇女有急产，不顾深更半夜，冒着严寒风雪，赶到了医院，当时王湘兰呼吸微弱，生命垂危。那意玛考恩医生尽了最大努力，动了剖腹手术，将母女两人都救活了。王湘兰母女在那意玛考恩医生和中国医务人员的亲切照顾下，调养了四十天，母女健康出院。回到家里，公婆都感激得哭了。为了永远不忘那意玛考恩医生的救命之恩，全家人给这个女孩取名“苏华”，以表示中苏两国人民的深厚友谊。
    今年苏华已经四岁半了，她长得那么健壮可爱。她常常问她妈妈：苏军叔叔在那里？我长大了一定要去看叔叔。
    苏联军队虽然已经撤离旅大两年多了，但旅大人民却无时不在怀念和感激他们。（附图片）
