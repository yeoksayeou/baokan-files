　　Random Thoughts on the Yangtze River Bridge
　　Ge De
    The newspapers are all hailing the great achievement of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. People might be interested to know the views of foreign newspapers. I happen to have an article from the London Times. This is a dispatch from the newspaper's Hong Kong correspondent. The first sentence exclaims that this is "one of the most amazing achievements of New China." Then it describes the history of the bridge. It says that the Chinese wanted to build this bridge as early as the late Qing Dynasty, and later through the Northern Warlord Government and the Kuomintang Government, it was said to be built several times, but they were always unwilling to build it, and in fact, could not afford to build it. Chinese scholars, including the famous Chinese engineer Zhan Tianyou, as well as many people from Germany, the United States, etc., had repeatedly planned and surveyed it, but never received the support of the rulers. The article quotes a folk song: "The Yellow River's water, the bridge over the Yangtze: one cannot be cured, the other cannot be built," to illustrate the people's views at the time.

    The article also mentioned that the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge presented "special difficult problems." But "after the current regime came to power, it ordered the design and survey to be carried out... The entire complex plan took several years, and the construction of the double-decker bridge across the Yangtze River took just over two years." The rest of the article mainly describes the practical difficulties in the construction of the bridge, the process of overcoming the difficulties, the great role of Soviet experts in the construction of the bridge, and so on.

    The above is probably the reason for the British reporter's "surprise." However, my random thoughts arise from this. The completion of the Yangtze River Bridge is indeed a great achievement of the Chinese people, but it is not "the most amazing." Because there are many achievements that are "more" amazing than this. For example, the Chinese people struggled bitterly for more than a hundred years to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and later bureaucratic capitalism; from the day they began to establish the People's Government until they built a united People's Government, it took them more than twenty years of hard work. Isn't this achievement even more amazing? It's just that some people are unwilling to admit it. Furthermore, the achievements of several major movements are far "more amazing" than the construction of a Yangtze River Bridge. Moreover, without the establishment of this new regime and social transformation, the Yangtze River Bridge would never have been successfully built, as the reporter's account of the history of bridge construction before liberation can prove. Even the completion of this bridge is just a small attempt in the long journey of the Chinese people to transform nature. "A small attempt" and "great achievement" is enough to surprise some people, so when the Chinese people show their great skills, won't that make some people even more stunned?

    In fact, the reason why some people are surprised is because they looked down on the Chinese too much in the past. Take that folk song, it does not indicate the incompetence of the Chinese people, but only reflects the people's satire of those in power who clamored to build bridges before liberation. Just as someone changed the sign of the Kuomintang's "Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission" before liberation to "Yellow River Water, Conservancy Committee," it means that they only used water conservancy and bridge construction as a guise to extract wealth from the people to enrich themselves, and as for the bridge and water, they would never seriously build or manage them. In the short few years after liberation, the Chinese people did not suddenly grow three heads and six arms, but the bridge was built; and the task of fundamentally controlling the Yellow River has also begun. This folk song should also be changed to: "The Yellow River's water, the bridge over the Yangtze, one can be cured, the other is built." Such a new folk song not only reflects the people's praise of their own strength, but also praises the Communist Party and the People's Government, because it is the leadership of the Communist Party and the establishment of the People's Government that liberated and organized the great creative power of the Chinese people.

    Although the Chinese people have not grown three heads and six arms after liberation, it does not mean that there have been no changes. People transform themselves in the transformation of society, and also transform themselves in the transformation of nature. This is the transformation of people's thinking and the transformation of technology. The newspaper just has some small statistics on the transformation of people during the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge: "In the process of bridge construction, 2,412 ordinary workers were trained to become technicians, 90 technicians and interns were trained to become engineers, 153 interns were trained to become technicians, 9 workers were trained to become technicians, and the skills of 4,461 workers and 801 engineering and technical personnel were improved. This engineering team of thousands of people can now independently use the world's latest technology to build bridges..."

    Although there are no statistics, I think there must also be many people who have developed from the masses to become Party and League members during the bridge construction.

    The changes in people have made a technical army of the working class grow up. I think this is the greatest achievement in bridge building. This is an invincible achievement. In the National Day parade in Chongqing, didn't people from the Wuhan Bridge staff who were sent to prepare for the construction of the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge participate? This proves once again the greatness of the people and the leadership of the Communist Party. Even according to the historical facts described by the British reporter, we can only draw such a conclusion: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the ideals of the Chinese people be turned into reality." This is of course a conclusion that "The Times" is unwilling to put forward. But the fact is so, what can be done?

### 关于长江大桥的杂感

　　关于长江大桥的杂感
　　葛德
    报纸上都在欢呼武汉长江大桥的伟大成就。人们或许有兴趣知道一下外国报纸的看法。手边恰好有一篇伦敦泰晤士报上的文章。这是该报驻香港记者发的一则电讯。第一句就惊呼这是“新中国最惊人的成就之一”。接着叙述了这个大桥的历史。说中国人想修这座大桥开始于满清末年，后来经北洋军阀政府、国民党政府，几次说修，而又始终不肯去修，实际上也修不起。中国的学者，包括中国的名工程师詹天佑，以及德国的美国的等等许多人，曾再三计划过，测量过，但始终得不到统治者的支持。文中引了一段民谣：“黄河的水，长江上的桥：一个治不好，一个造不了”，来说明人民当时的看法。
    这篇文章还说到长江大桥的建设提出了“特别的困难问题”。但是“在目前的政权执政后，就下令进行设计和测量……整个这项复杂的计划费了好几年时间，跨越长江的双层桥的建筑工作，用了两年多一点时间”。文章的其余部分，主要是描述大桥建设中的实际困难，克服困难的经过，苏联专家在建桥中的巨大作用等等。
    上述等等大概就是英国记者“吃惊”的原因吧。然而，我的杂感便也由此产生了。长江大桥的建成，确是中国人民一个伟大的成就，但并不“最惊人”。因为比这为“最”的成就还很多。比如说吧，中国人民为了打倒帝国主义，封建主义，后来又加上了官僚资本主义，就苦苦奋斗了一百多年；就从着手建立人民政府的那一天起，直到建成一个举国一致的人民政府止，也足足艰苦缔造了二十多年。这个成就不更惊人吗？只是有些人不愿承认罢了。再拿几大运动来说，其成就也远比建成一座长江大桥“惊人”得多。而且没有这种新政权的建立和社会改造，长江大桥也永远建不成功，那位记者关于解放前建桥历史的叙述倒也可作为证明。就是这座大桥的建成，从中国人民改造自然的长途来看，也不过是小试身手而已。“小试身手”而“伟大成就”，已足使一些人吃惊，那么当中国人民大显身手的时候，那不会更使一些人惊得目瞪口呆吗？
    其实有人所以感到吃惊，是由于过去太看中国人不起。就说那支民谣，并不表示中国人的无能，而只反映了人民对解放以前吵吵着要修桥的那些当政者的讽刺。如同有人去把解放前国民党“黄河水利委员会”的招牌改为“黄河水，利委员，会”一样，是说他们只以水利和修桥为幌子，榨取民财以肥私，至于桥和水是永远不会认真去造、去治的。解放以后短短的几年，中国人并没有突然地生出三头六臂来，然而大桥建成了；而且根治黄河的事也已着手进行着。这支民谣也应该改为：“黄河里的水，长江上的桥，一个能治好，一个造成了”。这样的新民谣，不仅反映着人民对自己力量的歌颂，而且是对共产党和人民政府的歌颂，因为正是共产党的领导，和人民政府的建立，才解放了并组织了中国人民的这伟大的创造力的。
    中国人民在解放后虽然没有长出三头六臂，但并不是没有变化的。人们在社会的改造中改造自己，也在自然的改造中改造自己，这就是人的思想的改造和技术的改造。报纸上恰好就有长江大桥建造中关于人的改造的一些小统计：“在大桥建设过程中，有二千四百一十二名普通工被培养成技术工人，有九十名技术员和实习生被培养成工程师，有一百五十三名实习生被培养成技术员，有九名工人被培养成技师，另外还有四千四百六十一名工人和八百零一名工程技术人员的技术有了提高。这支数千人的工程队伍，已经能独立地用世界上最新的技术来建设大桥。……”
    虽然没有统计，我想一定也有许多人，在建桥中，由群众发展为党团员的。
    人的变化，使一支工人阶级的技术大军成长起来了。我认为这才是建桥中最伟大的成就。这是无往不利的成就，在重庆国庆节游行队伍中，不就有由武汉大桥职工中派去筹建重庆长江大桥的人们吗？这就又证明了人民和共产党领导的同样伟大。就是根据英国记者所叙述的历史事实，也只能得出这样一个结论：“只有在共产党的领导下，中国人民的理想才能变为现实”。这当然是“泰晤士报”不愿提出的结论。但事实如此，又怎么办呢？
