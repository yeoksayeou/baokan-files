    Jianjiang River is one of the important waterways in Zhanjiang Prefecture, Guangdong Province, with many tributaries, flowing through Maoming, Hua County, Wuchuan and Dianbai counties. The total navigable mileage in the entire basin is more than 700 kilometers. The abundant products such as bamboo, fir, charcoal, fruits, sugar and oil produced in the Jianjiang Plain are all transported out through the Jianjiang River.

    鉴江航运
    鉴江是广东省湛江专区重要航道之一，支流很多，流经茂名、化县、吴川和电白等县。全流域可通航里程有七百多公里。鉴江平原所出产的竹、杉木、木炭、水果、糖和油等丰富物产，都经由鉴江运出。
