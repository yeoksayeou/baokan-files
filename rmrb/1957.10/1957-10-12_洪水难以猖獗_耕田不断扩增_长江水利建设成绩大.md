　　Floods are Difficult to Run Rampant, Cultivated Land is Constantly Expanding
    Great Achievements in Yangtze River Water Conservancy Construction
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The artery of our great motherland, the Yangtze River, has undergone large-scale management work since liberation.

    Since liberation, the central government has invested in the restoration and reinforcement of 3,600 kilometers of the Yangtze River's main dikes, completing over 700 million cubic meters of earthwork. If this were built into an earthen wall one meter wide and one meter high, it could circle the earth eighteen times. The completed stonework amounts to 2.6 million cubic meters.

    Currently, the most important sections of the Yangtze River's main dikes exceed the highest flood level of 1954 by one meter. The less important sections are also 0.3 to 0.8 meters higher than the highest flood level of 1954, and the general sections are more than one meter higher than the highest flood level of 1931. In addition to the famous Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate and Huangshantou Control Gate built in Jingjiang, and the famous Dujiatai Flood Diversion Gate built in Hanjiang, 950 culvert gates have been built along the Yangtze River in recent years. Nine flood storage and reclamation projects have also been constructed, with a total flood storage capacity of more than 30 billion cubic meters, expanding the cultivated land area by 1,115,000 mu according to incomplete statistics.

    In the past two years, in order to plan the comprehensive utilization of the Yangtze River basin, the state has also carried out huge surveying, drilling, and hydrological work. Topographic surveys of 120,000 square kilometers have been conducted, equivalent to 150 years of work before liberation. The depth of core and soil drilling reached 85,000 meters, equivalent to 25 times the total amount of drilling before liberation. Hydrological stations have grown to 1,800, more than one and a half times the total number of hydrological stations established in the eighty years before liberation. In the process of planning the comprehensive utilization of the Yangtze River basin, more than 20 Soviet experts and our country's water conservancy workers have worked together this year alone.

### 洪水难以猖獗　耕田不断扩增  长江水利建设成绩大

　　洪水难以猖獗　耕田不断扩增
    长江水利建设成绩大
    本报讯　我们伟大祖国的动脉——长江，解放后，进行了规模巨大的治理工作。
    解放后长江干堤由中央投资恢复和加固的有三千六百公里，完成的土方达七亿余公方，如果把它修成长宽各一公尺的一条土墙，可绕地球十八周。完成的石方达二百六十万公方。
    现在长江干堤最重要的堤段已超过1954年最高洪水位一公尺，较次要的堤段比1954年最高洪水位也高零点三至零点八公尺，一般的堤段也比1931年最高洪水位高一公尺以上。除了在荆江兴建了名驰中外的太平口进洪闸、黄山头节制闸和在汉江兴建了著名的杜家台分洪闸外，几年来在长江共修建了涵闸九百五十座，又修建了九处蓄洪垦殖工程，蓄洪总容量达三百多亿公方，扩大耕地面积据不完全统计有一百一十一万五千亩。
    近两年来国家为规划长江流域综合利用，还作了巨大的测量、钻探、水文工作。进行了十二万平方公里的地形测量，相当于解放前一百五十年的工作量。岩心和土壤钻探的深度达八万五千公尺，相当于解放前钻探总量的二十五倍。水文测站已发展到一千八百个，比解放前八十年间建立水文测站的总数还多一倍半。在进行长江流域综合利用规划的过程中，仅在今年就有二十多位苏联专家和我国水利工作者一道进行过工作。　（赵曦东）
