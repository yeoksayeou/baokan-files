Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 17th: A grand evening celebration was held on the 16th in the Column Hall of the Moscow Trade Union Building to celebrate the launch of the world's first artificial satellite. Approximately two thousand representatives from the Soviet science and technology community and others attended. The reports given by many scientists at the meeting aroused great interest among the audience.

Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, spoke first at the meeting, saying: For scientists in socialist countries, the launch of the artificial satellite is a festival with a double meaning: it is a festival of a new era in mankind's conquest of nature, and it is also a festival of the growth and maturity of Soviet science. This artificial satellite, orbiting along its trajectory, provides the most valuable data for future flights beyond the atmosphere, making it possible for Soviet scientists to launch artificial satellites equipped with various instruments in the near future.

Academician Berg then pointed out in his speech that the planned work of a large collective of scientists representing all aspects of human knowledge in the manufacturing of artificial Earth satellites is the decisive factor in realizing mankind's age-old ideal. The socialist system has created all the necessary conditions for this. The United States has also been studying the launch of artificial satellites for a long time. They even hired German experts to help. But this task has not yet been completed. Certain countries are pursuing a policy of scientific isolation against the Soviet Union, but it is those who implement this policy, not the Soviet Union, who are being isolated.

Professor Pobidonostsev said in his speech: The significance of launching an artificial Earth satellite lies first in that it allows us to make observations of the universe and the Earth's surface that have valuable scientific value. Astronomical telescopes installed in interstellar space will enable people to see things that cannot be seen by the naked eye now. Through artificial satellites, we can clearly see anything on the moon with a diameter of only twelve meters. In this way, it is possible to solve the problem of the road to Mars, and it is also possible to study the barren surface conditions of Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. At the same time, it is also possible to take X-ray photographs of the sun. What we see now on the sun's surface may only be the core of a huge fluffy ball covered with many glittering spots, and the normally invisible white halo of the sun may be the main source of light. There is no doubt that with the help of observations from artificial satellites, we will be able to understand the huge solar flares and predict the appearance of solar flares. In addition, it is also possible to determine the atmospheric composition of other planets. The nature of geomagnetism, which is still a mystery, may also be solved.

Professor Kukarkin's report aroused great interest at the meeting. He said that after the successful launch of the artificial satellite, the task of launching ballistic missiles around the moon is no longer so difficult.

Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: According to TASS: As of 6:00 PM Moscow time on October 16th, the artificial satellite and carrier rocket had orbited the Earth approximately one hundred and seventy-five times, traveling approximately seven million six hundred thousand kilometers.

Due to the study of the constantly sent situations observed by various methods, it is now possible to systematically determine the motion parameters of the satellite and the carrier rocket.

On the morning of October 17th, the carrier rocket had traveled approximately fourteen minutes, or six thousand seven hundred kilometers, more than the satellite. By the evening of the 17th, the carrier rocket will be leading by nearly seventeen minutes, or more than eight thousand kilometers. In terms of longitude, it will be approximately 4.25 degrees east of the satellite.

    苏联科学壮大成熟　人类征服宇宙伊始
    莫斯科举行盛会庆祝人造卫星诞生
    新华社莫斯科17日电　在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅里，16日举行了庆祝发射世界上第一颗人造卫星的盛大晚会。到会的有苏联科学技术界及其他代表约两千人。许多科学家在会上的报告引起了听众巨大的兴趣。
    苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫首先在会上发言说：对于社会主义国家的科学家来说，发射人造卫星是一个有双重意义的节日：这是人类征服自然的新纪元的节日，也是苏联科学壮大成熟的节日。这颗人造卫星沿着轨道运行，给未来的大气以外的飞行提供最有价值的资料，这使苏联科学家有可能在最近的将来发射出装有各种仪器的人造卫星。
    贝格院士接着在讲话中指出，代表人类知识各方面的科学家的庞大集体在制造人造地球卫星方面有计划的工作，是实现人类自古以来的理想的决定性因素。社会主义制度为这创造了一切必需的条件。美国很早也在研究发射人造卫星。他们还找了德国专家去帮忙。可是直到现在这个任务还是没有完成。某些国家对苏联执行科学孤立政策，但是，受到隔绝的恰恰是那些执行这种政策的人，而不是苏联。
    波别多诺斯切夫教授在发言中说：发射人造地球卫星的意义首先在于它可以使我们对宇宙和地球表面进行有宝贵科学价值的观察。装置在星际空间的天文望远镜，能使人们看到现在肉眼所不能看到的东西。通过人造卫星，我们可以看清楚月球上的任何只有十二公尺直径大小的东西。这样，就有可能解决通向火星之路的问题，也有可能研究水星、金星、木星和土星的荒瘠表面的情况。同时，还有可能用X射线来拍摄太阳的照片。现在我们所看到的太阳面很可能只是一个巨大的覆盖着许多闪亮光点的毛茸茸的球的核心，而通常不能看到的太阳的白光环则可能是主要的光源。毫无疑问，借助从人造卫星进行的观察，我们就能了解太阳上的巨大爆发，并且预知太阳上爆发的出现。此外，还有可能测定其他行星的大气组成。到目前为止还是一个谜的地磁性质也有可能得到解决。
    库卡尔金教授的报告在会上引起了很大的兴趣。他说，人造卫星发射成功后，解决发射围绕月亮的弹道导弹的任务，已经不是那么困难了。
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社讯：到10月16日莫斯科时间下午六点为止，人造卫星和运载火箭已经环绕地球转了一百七十五圈左右，经过的路程约有七百六十万公里。
    由于对不断送来的用各种方法观测到的情况进行了研究，现在已经可以系统地确定卫星和运载火箭的运动参数。
    10月17日早晨运载火箭比卫星多走了约十四分钟的路程，即六千七百公里。到17日晚上，运载火箭将领先近十七分钟，即八千多公里。就经度来说，它将在卫星以东约四点二五度的地方。
