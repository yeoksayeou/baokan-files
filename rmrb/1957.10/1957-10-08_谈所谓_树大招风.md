On the So-Called "Tall Trees Catch the Wind"
    Liu Feng

After the leading figures who opposed the Party and socialism were criticized and countered by the Party and the broad masses of people, some people felt sorry for them, saying that "tall trees catch the wind," as if someone was jealous of their high reputation and status and deliberately wanted to "pull down the best." This statement is quite vicious and can indeed play a role in misleading people and gaining sympathy.

Chen Ming repeatedly said to Ding Ling, "You are a great writer, who else would they criticize if not you!" As if Ding Ling's criticism was solely because she was a great writer. This turns a struggle to defend the interests of the Party into a dispute without principle. Li Rui, with her whole body of reactionary "arrogance," also used this tactic to win people over and make connections. A certain young Party member author's pride and complacency were criticized within the Party. Li Rui instigated, "You are the kind of person who stands out and gets noticed!" She used this to incite the comrade's dissatisfaction with the Party, thereby achieving her own base purpose of winning over the masses. "Look how jealous the Party is of talent, it opposes your success and fame! Only here with me will you be valued, only here will you find warmth, come on, come on!" This is what Li Rui thought in her heart.

But the facts are not like this at all.

Our Party has always respected people with knowledge and learning, and our country needs a large number of experts, scholars, and writers... the more the better. It would be even better if we could reach or surpass the international level in academics. Wouldn't it be the glory of the motherland and the Party if our country could produce more experts, scholars, and writers with international prestige? Right now, we don't have too many such well-known figures, but too few. The more people like this, the better, and no one would object. However, we consider even one expert, scholar, or writer with bourgeois individualism to be superfluous.

So, the problem is clearly not here.

Tracing back to the source, these leading figures were still poisoned by bourgeois individualism. None of these leading figures are not self-centered; in their minds, there is only "I" and nothing else. The masses, leaders, and the Party are not in their eyes. They believe that all achievements are the result of their individual efforts; they believe that they can achieve something on their own without acknowledging that the many favorable conditions in today's society are indispensable for their success.

The older ones think that their capital is large, their history is long, and they are arrogant and lawless, believing that, because of their status and so-called achievements, no one can do anything to them, no one can defeat them. The younger ones think that no one dares to risk the great sin of offending and suppressing new forces, so they are oblivious to everything, regardless of the immensity of the task, rushing around recklessly. In the literary and art circles, examples of the former are Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and Ai Qing, while examples of the latter are Liu Binyan and Liu Shaotang. In other industries, there are also not a few who boast of having participated in the revolution for several years, consider themselves progressive people, or even proclaim themselves non-Party Bolsheviks, using this as a shield.

As long as someone is well-known, regardless of age, they cannot be touched. The old veterans can only rise but not fall, can only be promoted but not demoted; they can only lead others, but they do not accept anyone's leadership. They demand one promotion after another, grasping all power, until they climb on top of the Party and the people. Of course, this kind of demand is difficult to satisfy, so they simply place themselves outside the Party or engage in anti-Party activities within the Party. As for the new, young forces who, in the present society, have been cultivated by the Party and have emerged smoothly without encountering any difficulties, this is not a bad thing. However, because fame and position come too easily, they inevitably overestimate themselves and attribute the merits to themselves alone. Once they encounter criticism and difficulties, they think that there is no hope for their lives. Or their demands for fame, position, and wealth become increasingly high, and when they are not satisfied, they become disheartened and lifeless, fostering dissatisfaction with the Party, and ultimately degenerating into anti-Party right-wing elements.

These "well-known figures" nurtured by the Party believe that the old have their reasons for being untouchable, and the young have their reasons for being untouchable. They do not know that as long as someone opposes the Party and socialism, whether they are old veterans or new forces, whether they are Party members or "progressive people," regardless of their past merits or present abilities, they are all treated equally and subject to counterattack and criticism, with no special treatment. The honor that the Party and the people give them, the Party and the people can also take back from them at any time.

The "tall trees catch the wind" argument cannot be used to deceive people, nor can it be used for self-consolation. As long as you are willing to sincerely support the Party and socialism, do not resist the Party's various policies and measures, as long as you sincerely accept socialist ideological transformation, as long as you diligently serve the people, whether you are a big tree or a small tree, you do not need to fear any strong wind. If you are a poisonous weed, no matter how small you are, this wind will uproot you, and you cannot escape.

    谈所谓“树大招风”
    刘丰
    反党反社会主义的头面人物，遭到党和广大人民的批驳和反击之后，有些人为他们抱屈，说是“树大招风”，好像有人忌妒他们的名誉地位太高，故意要“拔尖儿”似的。这种说法挺毒辣，也的确能起一些迷惑人和争取同情的作用。
    陈明就口口声声对丁玲说：“你是大作家，人家不整你整谁！”好像丁玲之被批判，仅仅为了她是一个大作家而已。这就把一场保卫党的利益的斗争，化为无原则纠纷。一身都是反动的“傲骨”的李蕤也是运用这种手法来拉拢人联络人的。一个党员青年作者的某些骄傲自满情绪，在党内遭到批评。李蕤就进行挑拨：“你这个人树大招风呀！”借此煽动这位同志对党不满，从而达到自己卑鄙的拉拢群众的目的。“你看党多么忌才啊，它反对你成功成名！你在我这里才会得到重视，才有温暖，来吧，来吧！”这就是李蕤心里的话。
    可是事实完全不是这样。
    我们党是一向尊重有知识有学问的人，我们国家也需要大批的越多越好的专家、学者、作家……，在学术上能达到国际水平，如能超过国际水平自然更好。我们国家能多出一些有国际威望的专家、学者、作家，这难道不是祖国和党的光荣？现在这样的知名人物，对于我们来说，不是太多，而是太少。这样的人物的多多益善，是谁也不会反对的。然而资产阶级个人主义的专家、学者、作家，我们连一个也认为是多余的。
    所以，问题显然不在这里。
    溯本穷源，这些头面人物还是中了资产阶级个人主义的毒害。这些头面人物没有一个不是自我中心论者，在他们心目中只有我而无其他。群众、领导者和党都不在他们的眼中。他们认为一切成就都是他个人单干的结果，他们认为只要自己单枪匹马就可以干出一个名堂来，而不承认今天社会上许许多多对他有利的条件，是他能有成就所不可或缺的。
    年老的以为自己资本大，历史久而飞扬跋扈，横行不法，自认为碍于地位和所谓成就，谁也奈何他不得，谁也打他不倒。年轻的则以为没有谁敢冒犯压制新生力量的大不韪，也就目空一切，不管天高地厚，横冲乱闯。在文艺界中前者有如丁玲、冯雪峰和艾青，后者则有刘宾雁、刘绍棠。在其他行业中自诩为参加革命若干年，自认为是进步人士或竟自封为党外布尔什维克的人以此为挡箭牌者，也不在少数。
    只要是天下知名了，就不管老少都不可碰。老资格则上得下不得，升得降不得，只可以他领导别人，他却不接受任何人的领导。要求一升再升，掌握一切大权，直到爬到党的人民的头上而后已。这种要求当然难于满足，就干脆自居党之外或者在党内进行反党活动。至于年轻的新生力量在现在的社会里得到党的培植，没有遇到什么困难就一帆风顺地脱颖而出，这也不是什么坏事。可是由于名位得来太易，就不免自视过高，而贪天之功。一遇批评和困难就认为此生没有希望了。或则名位利禄要求越来越高，满足不了，于是就心灰意懒，了无生意，滋长了对党的不满情绪，终至堕落成反党的右派分子。
    这些由党一手培养起来的“知名之士”，自以为老有老的碰不得的道理，少有少的碰不得的理由。他们不知道只要是反党反社会主义，不管他是老资格也好，是新生力量也好，不管他是党员也罢，“进步人士”也罢，不管他过去功绩如何，现在能力怎样，都是一视同仁，在反击和批判之列，没有什么特殊照顾。党和人民给他的荣誉，党和人民也是随时可以从他那儿取回来的。
    “树大招风”说，既不能用来骗人，也不能用来自慰。只要是愿意真心诚意拥护党和社会主义，对党的各项政策措施不抗拒，只要诚诚恳恳接受社会主义思想改造，只要是勤勤恳恳为人民服务，不管自己是大树也罢小树也罢，都不必怕任何大风。如果你是毒草，不管你是多么小的一株，这一次的风，也非将你连根拔起不可，躲也躲不掉。
