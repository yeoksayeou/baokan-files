    Song of Independence (and Two Other Poems)
    Afghanistan Betab

    The people dedicate themselves to independence, the flag of victory flutters in the sky.
    For the sake of perfect and precious independence, we cheer for the festival of independence every year.
    Let us go to Chaman to listen to moving music, let us sing songs of independence together.
    People breathe freely on the day of independence, and independent Afghanistan will never depart from justice.
    Independence shines like a brilliant sun in all directions, and independence brings joy like dawn,
    Humanity will always need happiness and peace, they are proud of independence and sing for peace.
    The pen of independence will always record the truth, it refutes mutual killings and perfidy,
    The God of the universe has a pen from the beginning of time, and it writes the words of freedom for the people.
    People who are enemies of freedom and independence, listen,
    Betab announces to you: you will be imprisoned in prison, and you will never get freedom and independence.

      Pride and Courage
    This proud nation will drink the blood of the enemy with pleasure.
    It is calling all the time: the enemy is where the battlefield is.
    Like a bullet leaving the chamber, it rushes forward bravely and quickly.
    Oh, Afghan nation, the children you bear are brave and strong.
    One person fights bravely, and a thousand cowards cannot resist.
    Hey, timid hen, how can you compare with a strong rooster?

        Hope for Peace
    We hate the enemy as much as we hate poison gas,
    We spew out the fire of hatred from the bottom of our hearts.
    Our appearance is like a raging flame,
    A ball of hot fire buried in our chests.
    But we pray to God not to bring disaster to the world,
    And not to subject mankind to new war wounds.
    If the cruel atomic bomb explodes,
    Both East and West will suffer.
    If another world war breaks out on earth,
    The people of the East and the West will suffer death.
    Therefore, Betab said, peaceful coexistence is much stronger than war.

    [Translator's note] Betab is the most famous modern poet in Afghanistan and is known as the "King of Poetry" of Afghanistan. He wrote many poems praising the life and love of the Afghan people. When Afghanistan was repeatedly invaded by Britain before 1919 and fought for independence and freedom, Betab wrote many patriotic and combat-meaningful poems. The first two poems are from that time.

    独立之歌（外二首）
    阿富汗　贝塔布人民为独立献身，天空飘扬着胜利的旗。为了完美珍贵的独立，我们年年欢呼独立的节日。让我们到查曼去听动人的音乐，让我们齐唱独立的歌曲。人们在独立节日自由呼吸，独立的阿富汗决不离开正义。独立好像灿烂的太阳照耀四方，独立又像黎明给人带来欢畅，人类永远需要幸福与和平，他们为独立骄傲，为和平歌唱。独立的笔永远记载真理，它驳斥互相残杀，背信弃义，宇宙之神从开天辟地就有支笔，它把自由的文字写给人民。与自由独立为敌的人们听着，贝塔布向你们宣布：你们将被囚禁在监狱，永远地得不到自由和独立。
      骄傲和勇敢这个骄傲的民族要痛饮敌人的血。它无时不在号召：敌人那里就是战场。像子弹出膛它勇猛疾速奔向前方。阿富汗民族啊，生育的儿女勇敢坚强。一人勇敢作战，一千个懦夫难挡。嘿，胆怯的母鸡，同雄健的公鸡怎比得上？
        希望和平我们恨敌人就像恨毒瓦斯，我们从心底喷出仇恨的火光。我们的外形如熊熊的火焰，一团团热火埋在胸膛。但我们祈祷上帝不要把灾难降给人间，不要使人类蒙受新的战争创伤。要是残酷的原子弹爆炸，东方西方同要遭殃。要是世界大战再在地球上爆发，东西方的人民都将遭受死亡。所以，贝塔布说，和平共处要比战争强又强。
    〔译者注〕贝塔布是阿富汗近代最著名的老诗人，被誉为阿富汗“诗中之王”。他写了许多歌颂阿富汗人民的生活和爱情的诗歌，当阿富汗在1919年前屡次受到英国侵犯而为独立自由斗争时，贝塔布写了许多爱国的富有战斗意义的诗。这三首诗中前两首，就是那时候写的。
