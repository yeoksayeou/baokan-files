Xinhua News Agency, 7th: China's democratic parties' central committees have recently issued instructions or notices to their local organizations, requiring them to solemnly and grandly celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang stated in its instructions that all levels of the RCCK organizations should take the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution as an important political task. All levels of organizations should vigorously mobilize and organize members and the masses they contact to actively participate in local celebrations and encourage members to read relevant documents and materials published in newspapers and periodicals during this period. All levels of organizations may also hold report meetings and forums separately as needed and as possible, mainly discussing the great achievements of the socialist camp.

    The instructions require that all levels of RCCK organizations should combine celebration activities with the current anti-Rightist struggle. In report meetings and forums, systematically refute the various fallacies spread by the Rightists inside and outside the RCCK who are anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-socialist, so that participants can ideologically recognize the serious harm of the Rightists' malicious plots to slander the Soviet Union, oppose learning from the Soviet Union, and provoke Sino-Soviet relations. They should recognize the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation to human progress and world peace, thereby enhancing their will to fight the Rightists and strengthening their determination to transform their political stance.

    The instructions also state that November 12 this year marks the 91st anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. All levels of the RCCK organizations should combine the publicity of the October Revolution's influence on Sun Yat-sen, the Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese revolution, and the great significance of Sun Yat-sen's "taking Russia as a teacher," so that members receive a profound socialist and internationalist education, and thus strive to defend the path of the October Revolution and consolidate and develop Sino-Soviet friendship with practical actions.

    The Central Committee of the China Democratic League issued instructions on the 7th, stating that local organizations of the CDL and all its members should attach great importance to the enormous significance of commemorating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. This commemoration activity should be combined with a broad socialist and internationalist ideological education campaign within the league; appropriately combined with the current struggle to fight back against bourgeois Rightists, criticize various anti-Soviet and anti-Communist fallacies, criticize reactionary bourgeois nationalist ideas, criticize reactionary words and deeds that harm and undermine the unity of socialist countries, and criticize the erroneous attitude of resisting earnest learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience. To this end, in addition to mobilizing all members to actively participate in various commemoration activities for the October Revolution organized uniformly in the local area, local organizations of the CDL may also hold report meetings, forums, exhibitions, etc. suitable for the requirements of CDL members according to the specific circumstances and needs of the local area.

    The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy issued a notice on the 7th, requiring local organizations of the CAPD to hold commemoration meetings, report meetings, or forums, etc., to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution as much as possible under the unified leadership of the local party and government within one month before the October Revolution Day. They should absorb members and the masses they contact to participate, and promote Sino-Soviet friendship, the path of the October Revolution, the great achievements of the Soviet Union and the guiding significance of its experience for our country's revolution and construction, the great role of the Soviet Union's strength and the consolidation and unity of the socialist camp in defending peace, etc. The notice also requires that local organizations of the CAPD should combine the ideological education work of socialism and internationalism with the anti-Rightist struggle to make the anti-Rightist struggle more universal, in-depth, and thorough.

    The Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued instructions on the 7th, stating that through the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the great October Revolution, a profound socialist education can be carried out for members of the CPWDP. The historical facts of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution can be used to educate members to deeply understand that only by following the path of the October Revolution, which is the path of socialism, can we follow the law of historical development. The instructions require local organizations to systematically organize members to participate in various commemoration activities and celebration meetings held locally under the unified plan and arrangements of the local area; hold various report meetings, exhibitions, and forums to commemorate the October Revolution; and organize the study of documents related to the October Revolution, etc.

    The China Zhi Gong Party convened a central standing committee administrative meeting on the 5th and issued instructions on the same day regarding the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The instructions stated that in addition to actively participating in the celebration activities uniformly arranged by the local area, all levels of local organizations and individuals must also hold various commemorative activities in the organs according to their own conditions, such as report meetings, forums, evening parties, etc., so that the members and the masses they contact will have at least one opportunity to receive socialist education during this grand celebration period.

    The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society issued instructions on the 7th, stating that all members of the Jiusan Society should further recognize, through this celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, that they must unswervingly follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party of China together with the people of the whole country.

    The instructions also stated that over the past forty years, the Soviet Union has accumulated exceptionally rich, complete, and systematic advanced experience in economic construction and cultural construction, and has also climbed to the peak of world science and technology at the fastest pace. All members of the Jiusan Society must further recognize the great political significance of earnestly learning from the Soviet Union's socialist construction experience and advanced Soviet science and technology from this celebration activity.

    The headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued instructions on the 7th, requiring the local organizations of the TDSGL to combine the various commemoration activities celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution with the publicity and education work of the current rectification campaign within the TDSGL, carry out in-depth publicity to the members, so that all members of the TDSGL will more firmly accept the leadership of the Communist Party, follow the socialist road; and work harder to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet people in building socialism and the spirit of hard work and thrift in building the country, and strive to build a socialist motherland and liberate Taiwan.
