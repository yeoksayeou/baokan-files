    Telegram to the United Nations General Assembly
    The United Nations General Assembly is currently discussing the Syrian government's complaint. Public opinion recognizes the seriousness of the situation. It recognizes that world peace is threatened. Powerful naval, air, and land forces are gathering off the coast of Syria and on the Turkish-Syrian border. Any intervention by these forces could easily trigger a world war.
    Syria is a country with four million inhabitants and a small army. It has declared a policy of neutrality and has not joined any military blocs. Turkey is a country with twenty-two million inhabitants and powerful armed forces, and is a member of the Atlantic Pact and the Baghdad Pact. Public opinion opposes any military intervention and interference in Syria's internal affairs, regardless of where such intervention comes from.
    The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council requests the United Nations General Assembly to call upon the governments concerned to declare or reaffirm their guarantees to the Assembly: that they will not resort to force and will respect the sovereignty and integrity of Syria.
    It urges the Assembly to take urgent measures to eliminate the threat to Syria, especially the dangers inherent in the concentration of large numbers of troops in the region.
    It hopes that the United Nations, in the spirit of its Charter, will assume its full responsibility and ensure that aggression cannot be launched in this region under any pretext.

    致联合国大会的电报
    联合国大会现在正在讨论叙利亚政府的控诉案。舆论认识到局势的严重性。它认识到，世界和平受到了威胁。在叙利亚的海岸外面的海面上，在土叙边境上，集结着强大的海军、空军和陆军部队。这些部队的任何干涉都可能会很容易地挑起一场世界大战。
    叙利亚是一个有四百万居民而军队很少的国家。它宣布执行中立政策，而且并没有参加任何军事集团。土耳其是一个有二千二百万居民和强大的武装力量的国家，参加了大西洋公约和巴格达条约。舆论将反对任何军事干涉和对叙利亚内政的干涉，不管这种干涉来自何方。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会要求联合国大会吁请有关政府在大会上宣布或者重申它们的保证：它们不会诉诸武力，将尊重叙利亚的主权和完整。
    它吁请大会采取紧急措施来消除对叙利亚的威胁，特别是在这个地区集结大量军队这种情况所包含的危险。
    它希望联合国本着它的宪章的精神承担起它的全部责任，并且保证，在这个地区不可能在任何借口下发动侵略。
