    Enamelware Tank with a Capacity of 1,000 Liters

    On the 17th, the enamelware workshop of the state-owned Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory successfully fired its first enamelware tank with a capacity of 1,000 liters. After inspection, the quality was found to be excellent.

    In the past, China could not manufacture this type of larger enamelware tank and had to rely entirely on imports, which were very expensive. The 1,000-liter enamelware tank produced by this factory is much cheaper than imported goods.

    Enamelware tanks are resistant to strong acids and are indispensable equipment for the chemical industry. They can be used as reaction tanks, condensers, evaporation pots, reflux condensers, chlorination towers, and various stirrers in chemical plants.

    能容一千公升的搪玻璃罐
    国营山东新华制药厂搪玻璃车间17日烧成了第一个容量一千公升的搪玻璃罐，经过检验，质量良好。
    这种较大型的搪玻璃罐，过去我国不能制造，全靠进口，价格昂贵。这个厂生产的容量一千公升的搪玻璃罐，其价格比进口货便宜得多。
    搪玻璃罐能耐强酸，是化学工业不可缺少的设备。它可作化学工厂用的反应罐、凝冷器、蒸发锅、回流器、氯化塔和各式搅拌器等。
