    Celebrating the Successful Launch of the First Artificial Satellite
    Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
    On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial satellite, which is also the first man-made satellite in the history of mankind. This is another major victory for the Soviet scientific community and the starting point for mankind to explore the universe.

    Since the beginning of human civilization, there has been an ideal of traveling around the universe, but before the flourishing of modern science, all such talk was nothing but empty and mysterious fantasies. In the late nineteenth century, a Russian high school mathematics teacher, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, studied various problems of interstellar travel, proposed the advantages of using liquid as a combustion propellant, and published a paper in 1903 discussing the issue of jet propulsion engines. Tsiolkovsky died in 1935. To commemorate this important pioneer of modern rocket research, the Soviet Academy of Sciences established a special gold medal for interstellar travel science in 1954.

    The reason for adding artificial satellites and rockets as a project in the International Geophysical Year is to use the precision instruments carried on the satellite to measure solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, ionospheric density, micrometeorites, cosmic rays, and the shape of the earth at different distances from the earth. However, special precision instruments are required to measure various items. Even for the same item, such as air density and temperature, the instruments are different depending on the distance from the ground. Therefore, a small satellite cannot simultaneously measure many kinds of phenomena in the sky but can only be limited to certain phenomena. The advantage of satellites over rockets is that rockets stay in the air for only a moment, while satellites can orbit the sky for several days, years, or even longer, thus enabling people to better understand the conditions of interstellar space. The data measured by the instruments on the satellite can be automatically reported to the ground at any time via radio and electronic computers. The larger the satellite, the greater the increase in manufacturing costs, and the more serious the structural difficulties.

    The United States also announced that it would launch an artificial satellite this year, but due to the failure of the rocket test for launching the artificial satellite, it had to be postponed to the spring of 1958.

    To manufacture an artificial satellite and make it orbit the earth and stay in the air for a certain period of time is an extremely complex and difficult task. It is not a problem that can be solved by a single science but requires close cooperation among many scientific departments such as mathematics, mechanics, metallurgy, mineralogy, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, machinery, industry, and radio to succeed.

    To make an artificial satellite operate in the air without being attracted by the earth and falling to the ground, it must reach a speed of eight kilometers per second, or 28,000 kilometers per hour, in the air. However, this speed cannot be reached in places closer to the ground where the air density is higher, because the air resistance will cause the satellite to heat up and burn. Therefore, the first problem to be solved is to have a three-stage or multi-stage rocket to use the method of gradually increasing the speed to bring it to a place where there is almost no air, and then reach a speed of eight kilometers per second. In addition, the rocket's fuel, the regulation of the satellite's orbit, and the manufacture and arrangement of various instruments must all be uniquely creative.

    The fact that the Soviet Union was the first to launch an artificial satellite in human history not only marks the high level of various sciences in the Soviet Union but also proves the close and excellent cooperation among scientific departments under the Soviet system, which no capitalist country in the world can match. Its achievements are outstanding, and its efforts are arduous, which should be recognized by the world's scientific community. We should be especially happy and encouraged that the Soviet Union has always been the cornerstone of the fortress of peace. The Soviet Union's mastery of the world's natural sciences also marks the guarantee of world peace. When the Soviet Union announced the success of the intercontinental missile two months ago, many capitalist countries, such as Adenauer of West Germany, suspected that it was an unreliable propaganda. The New York Herald Tribune lamented that the weapons of "intimidation and blackmail" had fallen into the hands of Eastern communist countries. The success of the launch of the first artificial satellite is like a bright light hanging in the sky, which can eliminate all doubts about the great achievements of the Soviet Union in natural science, and at the same time, it shatters the dream of the United States to dominate the world and the universe.

    The emergence of the first artificial satellite will expand the scope of human activities to the entire universe, enabling human wisdom to overcome nature and increase infinite confidence.

    庆祝第一个人造卫星发射成功
    中国科学院副院长　竺可桢
    1957年10月4日苏联发射的第一个人造卫星，亦即世界人类历史上第一个人造的卫星成功了。这是苏联科学界又一次重大的胜利，也是人类开拓宇宙的起点。
    人类自有文化以来，即有周游宇宙空际的理想，但是在近代科学未昌明以前，一切妄谈均属虚无玄妙的幻想而已。十九世纪末叶，俄国的一位中学数学教师乔奥尔柯斯基研究了星际旅行的种种问题，提出以流质为燃烧原动力的优点，并于1903年发表论文讨论喷射推进机关的问题。乔奥尔柯斯基于1935年去世，苏联科学院为了纪念这位近代研究火箭的重要先驱者，在1954年专门设立了一个星际旅行的科学金质奖章。
    国际地球物理年中所以增加人造卫星和火箭这一个项目，目的在于能在离地球不同距离的高空中由卫星上所带着的精密仪器来测定太阳幅射、大气压力、温度、湿度、风速、风向、游离层的密度、小流星、宇宙线和地球形状等等。但测量各种项目必须有特制的精密仪器不可，甚至同一个项目如空气的密度、温度等在离地远近不同，仪器亦即有别。所以一粒小的卫星上面不能同时测定许多种天空中的现象，而只能限于某几种现象。卫星比火箭的好处在于火箭在空中逗留时间不过片刻，而卫星则可环游天空数日、数年或更久的时间，因此更能使人们了解星际空间的状况。在卫星上的仪器所测出的数据可由无线电和电子计算机自动地随时报告地面。卫星愈大则不但制造的费用增加极大，而且构造上的困难亦愈益严重。
    美国也曾宣布过要在今年发射人造卫星，但由于在发射人造卫星的火箭的试验上即遭失败，因此不得不延期到1958年春天。
    要制造一颗人造卫星，使之环绕地球、停留在空中若干时间，这是一个极其复杂而艰难的工作，它并不是单靠一门科学所能解决的问题，而要靠许多科学部门如数学、力学、冶金、矿物、化学、气象、天文、机械、工业、无线电等紧密的合作才能成功。
    要使人造卫星运行于空中而不致被地球所吸引而落到地上，必须在空中达到每秒钟八公里即每小时二万八千公里的速度，但是这个速度又不可以在离地面较近而空气密度较大的地方就达到，因为空气的阻力就会使卫星发热而焚化。所以首先要解决的一个问题是要有一个三节或多节的火箭用逐级增加速度的办法把它带到几乎没有空气的地方，然后才达到每秒八公里的速度，此外还有火箭的燃料，卫星轨道的规定，所带各类仪器的制造与安排统须别具心裁的创作。
    这次苏联所以能在人类历史上第一个放射人造卫星，这不但标志着苏联各门科学高度的水准，而且也证明了在苏维埃制度下各科学部门之间紧密而优良的合作，这是世界上任何资本主义国家所不能几及的。它的成就卓越，用力艰巨应为世界科学界所公认。我们尤应欢欣鼓舞的是苏联素来是和平堡垒的柱石，苏联掌握了世界的自然科学的牛耳，也标志着世界和平有了保障。当二个月前苏联发表洲际导弹成功时，许多资本主义国家如西德的阿登纳还疑为是不可靠的宣扬，又如纽约先驱论坛报悲叹“恐吓讹诈”的武器已落入东方共产主义国家之手。这次第一颗人造卫星发射的成功，尤如挂在天空的明灯，正可杜绝一切对于苏联在自然科学上伟大成就的疑虑，同时也破灭了美国要霸占世界、霸占宇宙的幻梦。
    第一颗人造卫星的出现，将把我们人类的活动范围扩展到整个宇宙，使人类的智慧能克服自然又增加了无限的信心。
