Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th - Vietnam is holding report meetings.
Comrade Truong Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, delivered a report at the Hanoi Labor Club on the morning of the 10th to 1,200 cadres, intellectuals, and democratic figures, discussing the influence of the victory of the October Socialist Revolution on the Vietnamese revolution.

In his report, Truong Chinh said that the reason the Vietnamese proletarian party was able to lead the Vietnamese revolution to victory was mainly because, for the past thirty years, the Party has correctly followed the Marxist-Leninist line and held the exclusive leadership of the revolution.

Truong Chinh called on the entire party and people of the Vietnam Workers' Party to actively learn from the spirit of hard struggle of the Soviet people and redouble their efforts to build their motherland.

This is the second report made by Truong Chinh since Vietnam began preparing to celebrate the October Revolution nationwide.

The Vietnamese Socialist Party (whose members are mostly senior intellectuals) is preparing to hold a series of thematic report meetings to introduce Soviet science and technology and other achievements. The first thematic report was held on the 9th, introducing the Soviet artificial satellite.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 11th - Bulgaria is publishing a large number of books.
In order to welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, Bulgaria has published approximately 104,000 copies of books and pamphlets related to the October Revolution, including Lenin's collection of essays on the October Revolution, Blagoev and Dimitrov on the October Revolution, etc.

In the past thirteen years, Bulgaria has imported a total of more than 48.4 million copies of various books in Russian and translated into Bulgarian from the Soviet Union, including 890 kinds of works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin translated and published in Bulgarian, with more than 13.9 million copies.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 11th - The Indo-Soviet Cultural Society is actively preparing.
The National Committee of the Indo-Soviet Cultural Society has called on the whole country to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. It has called on all branches to organize mass rallies, cultural gatherings, and film screenings to celebrate this historic festival.

In Delhi, the Delhi branch of the Indo-Soviet Cultural Society is carefully organizing a three-day program within the first week of November, which includes public gatherings, Indo-Soviet friendship forums, and fraternal gatherings of Soviet and Indian people in the capital. Prominent Indian figures Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru and others will speak at these gatherings. In addition, it is planned to screen Soviet films and exhibit Soviet books and periodicals.
