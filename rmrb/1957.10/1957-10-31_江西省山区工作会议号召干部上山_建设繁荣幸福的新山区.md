Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, October 27th. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee convened a mountain area work conference from the 21st to the 26th. Among the two hundred plus cadres who attended, many expressed their willingness to take the lead in going to the mountains to strive for the construction of a prosperous and happy new socialist mountain area.

The conference studied in detail how to develop the mountain areas, and required Party and government organs at all levels to carry out a large-scale publicity campaign in conjunction with the current socialist great debate in the countryside, to educate the people and cadres in the mountain areas to face the mountains, develop the mountains, and criticize and overcome the erroneous thinking of fearing hardship and being unwilling to work in the mountains for a long time. Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Jiangxi Province, emphasized at the meeting that to march into the barren mountains, it is necessary to organize cadres to go to the mountains and strengthen the forces on the mountain labor front. Only when thousands upon thousands of cadres truly go to the mountains to participate in labor can they better understand the situation in the mountains and solve the problems in mountain construction, and only in this way can they drive the broad masses to go to the mountains. Shao Shiping said that in order to organize cadres to go to the mountains, all departments must do a good job in planning and conducting ideological education for the transfer of cadres to the mountains, and must educate cadres to have the great ambition of developing the mountains without fear of hardship for the sake of the socialist cause.

The conference determined that in the future, for the mountain areas, overall planning should be carried out, leadership should be strengthened, and agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production should be developed in accordance with local conditions to comprehensively develop the mountain economy. According to this guideline and the requirement of comprehensive afforestation within ten years, it was decided that under the unified planning and unified deployment of the state, various forms such as state investment and operation, state and agricultural cooperative joint operation, and collective operation by agricultural cooperatives under the guidance of the state should be adopted in accordance with local conditions to develop the mountain areas and form a socialist economic system with state-owned economy as the core in the mountain areas. It is planned that during the period of the Second Five-Year Plan, the province's forest land will be expanded to ten million mu, doubling the existing state-owned forest land, and seven mountains including Jinggang Mountain, Huanggang Mountain, and Jiulian Mountain will be developed in 1958, totaling two million four hundred thousand mu.

In order to realize this plan, the conference believes that all departments should support the construction of mountain areas. Finance and trade, grain, agriculture, water conservancy and other departments put forward plans or opinions to support the construction of mountain areas at the meeting. The transportation department proposed to vigorously build mountain roads, repair mountain folk transportation tools, dredge rivers, and increase transportation tools and civilian ships suitable for mountain areas. The finance and trade department proposed to appropriately reduce the price difference between certain industrial and agricultural products in the mountain areas in the past, based on actual conditions. The grain department proposed to appropriately take care of the people's food and feed needs, and correct the shortcomings of excessive proportion of miscellaneous grains left in some areas.

    新华社南昌27日电　中共江西省委和省人民委员会在21日到26日召开了山区工作会议。到会的二百多个干部中，有很多人表示要带头上山，为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义新山区而奋斗。
    会议详细地研究了如何开发山区的问题，要求各级党政机关结合当前农村社会主义大辩论，开展一次大规模的宣传活动，教育山区人民和山区干部面向山区、开发山区，批判和克服那种怕艰苦和不愿意在山区长期工作的错误思想。中共江西省委书记、江西省省长邵式平在会上强调指出，要向荒山大进军，就要组织干部上山，加强山区劳动战线的力量。只有成千上万的干部真正到山区去参加劳动，才能更好地了解山区的情况，解决山区建设中的问题，也只有这样才能带动广大群众上山。邵式平说，为了组织干部上山，各部门要做好抽调干部上山的计划和思想教育工作，要教育干部具有为了社会主义事业不畏艰苦开发山区的伟大抱负。
    会议确定，今后对于山区，要全面规划，加强领导，因地制宜地发展农、林、牧、副业各种生产，全面开发山区经济。根据这个方针和十年内全面绿化的要求，确定在国家的统一规划和统一布置下，因地制宜地采取国家投资经营、国家与农业社合营、以及在国家指导下由农业社集体经营等形式，把山区开发起来，在山区形成一个以国营经济为核心的社会主义经济体系。计划在第二个五年计划期间，全省林地扩展到一千万亩，比现有国有林地增加一倍，1958年内开发井岗山、黄岗山和九连山等七个山头，共计二百四十万亩。
    为了实现这个规划，会议认为一切部门都应该支援山区建设。财政贸易、粮食、农业、水利等部门在会上提出了支援山区建设的计划或意见。交通部门提出要大力修建山区公路，修整山区民间运输工具，疏浚河道，增加适应山区的运输工具和民船。财政贸易部门提出要根据实际情况，适当缩小过去山区某些工农业产品的差价。粮食部门提出将适当照顾人民的口粮和饲料需要，纠正部分地区留杂粮比例过大等缺点。
