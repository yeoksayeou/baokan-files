Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, 29th. Saudi Arabian official sources announced on the 27th that King Saud of Saudi Arabia's suggestion for a so-called "mediation" between Syria and Turkey "has not changed."

The statement adhered to Saudi Arabia's original stance, stubbornly claiming that Syria, like Turkey, had accepted Saudi Arabia's proposed "mediation."

Prior to Saudi Arabia's release of this statement, the Syrian government had repeatedly denied accepting the so-called "mediation" proposal and declared that Syria insists on accusing Turkey in the United Nations. Syrian and other Arab countries' public opinion has repeatedly pointed out that this so-called "mediation" proposal is an attempt by imperialists to conceal their aggressive intentions towards Syria and avoid an embarrassing showdown in the United Nations. They have demanded that the Saudi King withdraw this proposal.

    不顾叙利亚的反对
    沙特阿拉伯坚持“调解”
    新华社29日讯　利雅得消息：沙特阿拉伯官方27日发表声明说，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特对叙利亚和土耳其进行所谓“调解”的建议“没有任何改变”。
    声明坚持了沙特阿拉伯原来的态度，硬说叙利亚已经同土耳其一样接受了沙特的所谓“调解”的建议。
    在沙特阿拉伯发表这项声明以前，叙利亚政府已经几次否认它曾经接受所谓“调解”的建议，并且声明叙利亚坚持在联合国中控诉土耳其。叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家舆论曾经一再指出，这种所谓“调解”的建议是帝国主义者企图用来掩饰它对叙利亚的侵略意图和避免在联合国中难堪地摊牌，它们要求沙特国王撤回这种建议。
