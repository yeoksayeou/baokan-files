    Beijing Brand Bus

    The Beijing Capital Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced a "Beijing Brand" bus similar to the Soviet ZIS-155 model in July this year, using components such as the engine from the "Liberation" brand automobile. After the trial production was successful, it was put into production. The first batch of production tasks was completed in late September. A batch of these buses has already been shipped to Wuhan, preparing to participate in the Yangtze River Bridge opening ceremony. In addition, one vehicle is prepared to participate in the industrial exhibition held in Guangzhou.

    The Beijing brand bus is a light metal thin-walled structure automobile with a beautiful appearance and many advantages.

    北京牌公共汽车
    北京首都机械厂在今年7月份利用“解放牌”汽车的发动机等部件，试制成功了一种与苏联吉斯—155型相似的“北京牌”公共汽车。试制成功后，就投入了生产。第一批生产任务已经在9月下旬完成。其中有一批汽车已经运往武汉，准备参加长江大桥通车典礼。另外有一辆准备参加在广州举办的工业展览会。
    北京牌公共汽车是一种轻金属薄壁结构的汽车，外表漂亮，优点很多。
