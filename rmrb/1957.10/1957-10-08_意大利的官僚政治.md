    Italy's Bureaucracy

    A recent issue of the American "Time Magazine" reported on the astonishing situation of Italy's bloated administrative institutions, low administrative efficiency, and bureaucracy.

    In 1870, the Italian government had only 70,000 employees. Under Mussolini's rule, this number increased to 635,000. To date, according to verifiable materials, government employees have reached as many as 1.15 million, but only 20% of them are actually working.

    An Italian soldier was wounded in combat in 1943 and received a semi-disabled certificate three years later. However, it was not until August of this year, eleven years later, that he received his disability allowance. The Italian government gives the city of Naples an annual subsidy as living expenses for the orphans of soldiers in that area, but the total amount is only twenty-one US dollars a year, because that is what was stipulated in a decree promulgated in 1819. Currently, there is also an old-fashioned scholarship, which the government is heavily advertising for people to apply for, but each scholarship is only worth one dime and six cents, while the application costs three dimes and six cents. A citizen wanted to apply for permission to build a house, and for this matter, he filled out several pounds of forms and ran to nine different government departments. Not long ago, the government began to compensate the people of Sicily for the losses caused by Garibaldi's battle in 1860, but the maximum amount of compensation was only one-tenth of a cent. It is said that this is still the result of the government's "active efforts to improve work."

    意大利的官僚政治
    最近一期美国“时代周刊”报道了意大利行政机构臃肿、行政效率低落和官僚主义的惊人情况。
    1870年意大利政府雇员只有七万人，在墨索里尼统治时增至六十三万五千名，到目前为止，根据有案可查的材料，政府雇员已达到一百一十五万名之多，但其中真正在工作的仅占20％。
    有个意大利兵士，在1943年作战受伤，三年后领到半残废证，但到今年8月已相隔十一年，才领到残废补助金。意大利政府每年给那不勒斯市一笔补助费，作为这一个地方的军人的孤儿生活维持费，但是一年总共只合二十一美元，因为那还是1819年时公布的一项法令中规定的。目前有一种也是旧日规定的助学金，政府还大登广告，要人民去申请，但每个助学金只有一角六分，而申请却要花三角六分。有一个公民想要申请建筑一间房屋，为了这件事，他填写了几磅重的表格，奔走了九个不同的政府部门。不久以前，政府才开始向西西里人民赔偿因1860年受加利波的战役破坏的损失，但赔偿的数目最多的只有十分之一分。据说，这还是政府“积极努力，改进工作”的结果。
