Soviet Soldiers Infinitely Love the Communist Party
-- Abstract of the Soviet "Red Star" Editorial on the 27th

The editorial said that on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution, every Soviet person thinks again and again of the dear Communist Party, called by the people the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our era. The Party, created and nurtured by the great Lenin, raised the banner of revolution forty years ago, destroyed the system of exploitation and oppression on one-sixth of the earth's land, and opened a new era in human history—the era of socialism and communism. The Party firmly guides our motherland along the unprecedented path of building a new society, and in a short period of time, it has transformed our motherland from a backward agricultural country into a socialist power with advanced industry and collectivized agriculture.

The editorial pointed out that one of the greatest merits of the Leninist Communist Party is that it organized the people to defend the victorious achievements of the October Revolution. In the early days after the establishment of the Soviet regime, the imperialists tried everything to strangle the young Soviet state in its cradle, but they did not succeed. Because the entire people rose up to participate in the sacred struggle against the joint forces of domestic counter-revolutionaries and foreign interventionists, and because the Communist Party led this struggle, it established and cultivated an army unprecedented in history, an army of workers and peasants who had already won victory. In this struggle, the Soviet people and the Soviet people's army led by the Party and Lenin showed miracles of heroism, selfless enthusiasm, high ideological consciousness, and infinite loyalty to the great socialist ideals, thereby defending the world's first socialist country. During the Patriotic War, the Hitler bandits hoped to eliminate the Soviet Union in a few weeks. However, it was the aggressors who were crushed.

The editorial continued that in today's post-war era, the wise and visionary leader of the Soviet people, the Communist Party, tirelessly cares about strengthening national defense and improving the combat effectiveness of the Soviet army. Thanks to the Party's concern, our army is now equipped with everything necessary to annihilate any aggressor who dares to infringe upon our sacred land, up to and including atomic weapons, thermonuclear weapons, and rocket technology. We have excellent military cadres who are proficient in modern technology and weapons and are good at skillfully using them to achieve victory on the battlefield. All personnel of our armed forces are sons of the people loyal to the motherland and the cause of communism, brave, disciplined, and faithful soldiers who conscientiously perform their duties, and they constantly improve their combat skills. Of course, we cannot and have no right to be complacent because of the achievements we have already made, but should continuously improve the political consciousness and combat skills of the soldiers, have more model figures, first-class experts, coaching experts, and athletes in the army, and improve the combat readiness of troops, ships, and corps day by day.

The editorial emphasized that strengthening the Party's political work in the army and navy is of great significance for further consolidating the combat effectiveness of the Soviet armed forces. The task is to improve the quality of this work, so that commanders, political organs, and Party organizations can strengthen the education of soldiers in the spirit of infinite loyalty to the Soviet motherland, to the people, and to the Communist Party, and in the spirit of friendship between the Soviet nationalities and proletarian internationalism.

The editorial said that the soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy, like all Soviet people, are convinced by personal experience of the wisdom and foresight of the dear Communist Party, and that everything planned and done by the Party is for the benefit of the people. Therefore, they firmly love the dear Leninist Party, have infinite loyalty to the Party's great cause, and warmly support any suggestions and initiatives put forward by the Party Central Committee. Every Soviet soldier believes that it is a great honor to be a Communist Party member. On the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution, Soviet soldiers have repeatedly expressed their infinite love and loyalty to the Communist Party and its Leninist Central Committee, and are determined to dedicate all their strength to the great cause of communism.

    苏联军人无限爱戴共产党
    ——苏联“红星报”二十七日社论摘要
    社论说，在伟大十月革命四十周年的前夕，每一个苏联人都一次又一次地想到被人民叫做我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良知的亲爱的共产党。伟大列宁所缔造和培养起来的党在四十年以前举起革命的大旗，摧毁了地球六分之一土地上的剥削和压迫制度，在人类历史上开辟了新纪元——社会主义和共产主义纪元。党坚定地引导着我们祖国沿着前所未有的建设新社会的道路前进，在短时期内就把我们祖国从落后的农业国变成世界上先进的工业和集体化农业的社会主义强国。
    社论指出，列宁主义的共产党的最伟大的功劳之一，就是它组织人们捍卫了十月革命的胜利果实。在苏维埃政权建立后的初期，帝国主义者曾经用尽一切办法企图把年青的苏维埃国家扼杀在摇篮里，然而，它们并没有如愿以偿。因为全体人民都奋起参加了反对国内反革命和外国干涉者联合势力的神圣斗争，因为领导这个斗争的是共产党，它建立了和培养了历史上从来没有过的军队，已经取得了胜利的工人和农民的军队。在这场斗争中，苏联人民和由党及列宁所领导的苏联人民的军队表现出了英雄主义、忘我的热情、高度的思想性和对伟大的社会主义理想无限忠诚的奇迹，从而捍卫住了世界上第一个社会主义国家。在卫国战争期间，希特勒匪徒曾经指望在几个星期里消灭掉苏联。但是，被粉碎的却是侵略者。
    社论接着说，在战后的今天，苏联人民的英明而具有远见的领袖共产党不倦地关怀着国防力量的加强和苏联军队战斗力的提高。由于党的关怀，我们的军队现在配备了为歼灭胆敢侵犯我们神圣土地的任何侵略者所必需的一切装备，直到原子武器、热核武器和火箭技术。我们有出色的军事干部，他们精通现代技术和武器，并善于熟练地运用它们以取得战场上的胜利。我们武装部队的全体人员都是忠于祖国、忠于共产主义事业的人民的儿子，都是勇敢、守纪律、忠实地执行自己职责的军人，他们不懈地改进自己的战斗技能。当然，我们不能、也没有权利由于已有的成绩而自满，而应当使军人的政治觉悟和战斗技能不断提高，使军队中有更多的模范人物、第一流的专家、教练专家和运动家，使部队、舰艇和兵团的战斗准备一天天地提高。
    社论强调说，在陆军和海军中加强党的政治工作对进一步巩固苏联武装部队的战斗力有着严重的意义。任务在于：提高这一工作的质量，使指挥官、政治机构和党组织加强教育军人具有无限忠诚于苏维埃祖国、忠于人民和共产党的精神，具有苏联各民族友好和无产阶级国际主义精神。
    社论说，苏联陆海军战士们和所有苏联人民一样，根据亲身经验确信亲爱的共产党的英明和远见，确信党所计划和所做的一切都是为了人民的利益。因此，他们坚定地热爱亲爱的列宁主义的党，对党的伟大事业抱有无限的忠诚，并且热烈支持党中央委员会所提出的任何建议和倡议。每个苏联军人都认为，能成为一个共产党员是自己的莫大光荣。在伟大十月革命四十周年的前夕，苏联军人一次又一次地表现出对共产党及其列宁主义的中央委员会的无限热爱和忠诚，决心为伟大的共产主义事业献出一切力量。
