    Finding Fundamental Problems from Mass Opinions and Solving Them
    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Thoroughly Improves Work
    Postpones Major Debate and Mobilizes All Levels to Comprehensively Inspect Rectification
    (Our Newspaper News) The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has changed its rectification pace, postponing the originally planned socialist major debate in mid-October by more than half a month in order to concentrate efforts on thoroughly improving work and fully preparing for the major debate.
    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant organized more than 300 employee representatives to inspect the rectification situation. The inspection results showed that the plant’s work improvements were bold and resolute, but not yet thorough. Many facts prove that to thoroughly improve work, it is necessary to clarify the fundamental problems revealed in the rectification and their causes, and based on this, carry out institutional construction or ideological construction work to prevent the recurrence of past shortcomings or errors, establish new work styles and methods, and consolidate the achievements of the rectification.
    As of October 15, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant had processed 97% of the more than 21,000 problems raised by employees during the rectification. Among these processed problems, 90% have been resolved or explained. According to the inspection of employee representatives, the masses are satisfied with the handling of most of the problems. In more than a month, processing or resolving so many problems, including such a major issue as streamlining institutions, shows that the work improvement here is bold and resolute, and also very effective. However, due to the large number of problems, the short time, and the lack of detailed work, the improvements are not yet thorough:
    1. In the previous period, the factory's requirements or inspections for improving work were still focused on handling how many opinions or how many problems. This only shows that the leadership has accounted for every opinion raised by the masses, and only achieved solving problems on a case-by-case basis, "treating the head when it hurts, and the foot when it hurts," treating the symptoms but not the root cause. This was very necessary in the initial stage of rectification. However, the fundamental problems in the work of the workshop or factory and their causes have not been analyzed and summarized based on the specific and fragmented opinions raised by the masses. Therefore, some problems have only been temporarily resolved and have not been completely resolved. For example, the plant's raw coal storage reached more than 90,000 tons in August this year, exceeding the maximum reserve by nearly 30,000 tons. To prevent these coals from deteriorating, many measures need to be taken. As a result, a lot of manpower and material resources were wasted, and a large amount of working capital was tied up. After some employees posted big-character posters to criticize this issue, the leadership reduced more than 40,000 tons from the supply plan, so that the problem was temporarily resolved. However, the fundamental reason for the accumulation of raw coal is: the reserve of raw coal is determined based on the technical quota of producing more than 70 tons of clean coal for every 100 tons of raw coal. However, in the months before August, the clean coal produced for every 100 tons of raw coal had reached more than 80 tons. The technical quota has actually been increased, and the consumption of raw coal has decreased. However, the supply plan has not been changed according to this change in production, and a lot of raw coal has been accumulated. Last year, due to the poor quality of raw coal, the consumption of raw coal increased, and the supply plan did not increase the supply according to this situation, resulting in a shortage of raw coal supply at one time, which affected the production of coke. This phenomenon is mainly because technical management and planning management are disconnected. However, how to solve this problem from organizational management, work system, and cadre thinking has not yet been studied or formulated. Therefore, the situation of raw coal accumulation or tight supply may still occur.
    2. Some problems that can be solved are mistakenly considered unsolvable or should not be solved, and explanations are used instead of solutions. Workers in the oiling group of the foundry department once proposed that a turntable should be added to the small railway to facilitate transportation. The workshop's handling opinion on this issue was: there is no turntable at present, and it cannot be solved temporarily, and the foreman should explain to the workers. When the foreman explained to the workers, the workers had already found the turntable and installed it for use. Among the problems that have been processed in the whole factory, the problems that belong to explanations (that is, the opinions that cannot be done or are incorrect) account for more than 56%. Since most of the opinions raised by the masses are correct, then these problems handled by explanations are too many. There may be many problems that should be solved or can be solved hidden here, which need to be checked and continue to be solved.
    3. The work style of many cadres has undergone significant changes after being criticized by the masses, but some cadres have only generally admitted their mistakes to the masses and made apology-style self-criticisms. All the criticized cadres have not had time to analyze and examine the root causes of the shortcomings or errors from the criticisms of the masses, and improve themselves ideologically; some have not yet understood ideologically. Therefore, some cadres have not established a new work style; although the work style of some cadres has changed, it has not been consolidated from improving the ideological level.
    4. Most of the problems transferred from one unit to another within the factory are still in transit. According to the statistics of seven units such as the foundry workshop, a total of 2,147 problems were transferred to relevant units for processing. Only 437 of these problems have been answered and processed by the relevant units, and 80% of the problems have not been transferred back to the original units to explain the results of the processing to the masses.
    5. The factory's management structure has undergone revolutionary reforms, but the reduced personnel have not yet been properly arranged. To arrange these people, detailed ideological work and organizational work are required. At the same time, business reforms such as new work systems and methods adapted to the new management structure, as well as ideological work in this area, still need to be vigorously carried out. The current situation of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant shows that these tasks are very important for whether the enterprise management can be thoroughly improved and the achievements of this reform can be consolidated.
    The Party Committee of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant believes that launching a major debate under the above circumstances will inevitably affect the thorough improvement of work. Therefore, the plant decided to postpone the time of the major debate and made new arrangements on how to thoroughly improve work. Among them, the main measure is to adopt the method of working together from top to bottom to conduct another comprehensive inspection of the handling of mass opinions and the improvement of work. Each unit will hold two or three trade union group meetings to listen to employees' opinions on improving work. Problems that can be solved but have not been solved will be completely solved in the major inspection. In the mass inspection, special attention will be paid to those problems that belong to explanations and problems transferred to relevant units for processing. However, mass inspection can only check specific problems on specific issues. Therefore, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant emphasizes that leading cadres must personally analyze the opinions raised by the masses systematically, check the quality of work improvement, and propose what fundamental problems exist in their units and from which systems or ideological education they should be solved. During this period, cadres will also be organized to study the work system and work methods after streamlining the organization and other issues.
    The rectification situation of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant also shows that in the rectification stage, it is also unrealistic to completely establish a system to prevent the shortcomings and errors revealed in the rectification, or to completely solve the ideological problems of cadres before turning to debate, because that requires a relatively long time and very detailed work. In particular, ideological construction work needs to be carried out at the end of the rectification. However, the fundamental problems in various works exposed in the rectification and their causes must be clarified. This is the premise for carrying out institutional construction at present and ideological construction in the future.
    At the same time, according to the preliminary investigation of the ideological situation of some workers, the issues that workers are most concerned about in the debate are specific issues that are directly related to their lives; incorrect opinions account for a considerable number of these issues. Therefore, how to guide the debate on specific issues to the five issues in the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, how to cultivate the backbone of the debate, establish the advantage of correct opinions, etc., still need to be carried out carefully, and it is necessary to carefully calculate several major accounts, prepare persuasive materials, to ensure that socialist ideas win the debate, and ensure that all employees greatly improve their socialist consciousness in the major debate. Preparations in this area are actively underway.

    从群众意见中找出根本性问题加以解决
    石景山钢铁厂彻底改进工作
    推迟大辩论上下齐动手对整改进行全面检查
    本报讯　石景山钢铁厂改变整风步调，把原拟10月中旬开始的社会主义大辩论向后推迟半个多月，以便集中力量彻底地改进工作，并充分进行大辩论的准备。
    石景山钢铁厂曾组织三百多职工代表检查了整改的情况，检查的结果表明，这个厂工作改得大胆，改得坚决，但改得还不彻底。许多事实证明，工作要改得彻底，必须弄清楚整风中揭露出的根本性的问题及其产生的原因，据此进行制度建设或思想建设工作，以防止已发生的缺点或错误重新发生，树立新的工作作风和方法，巩固整风的成果。
    截至10月15日，石景山钢铁厂职工在整风中提出的两万一千多个问题，已处理了97％。这些已经处理的问题中，有90％得到了解决或解释。根据职工代表们的检查，群众对于绝大部分问题的处理表示满意。在一个多月的时间里，处理或解决这样多的问题，包括紧缩机构这样大的问题，说明这里改进工作是大胆而坚决的，也是有很大成效的。但由于问题多，时间短，和工作不够细致，改得还不彻底：
    一、前一时期工厂里对于改进工作的要求或检查，还停留在处理多少条意见或多少个问题上面。这只是表明领导方面对群众提的意见作到了件件有交代，只是作到了就问题解决问题，“头痛医头、脚痛医脚”，治了标未治本。这在整改阶段初期是非常必要的。但是还没有根据群众提的具体的零碎的意见，分析归纳出本车间或本厂工作中的根本问题及其产生的原因，因此，有些问题只是暂时解决了，并没有彻底解决。例如这个厂今年8月份原煤储存量达九万多吨，超过最高储备量近三万吨，为了使这些煤不变质，需要采取许多措施。结果既浪费了不少人力物力，又积压了大量流动资金。有些职工对这一问题贴出大字报提出批评以后，领导方面才从供应计划中削减了四万多吨，使问题暂时得到了解决。但造成原煤积压的根本原因是：原煤的储备量是根据每一百吨原煤生产七十多吨净煤这一技术定额确定的，但8月份以前的几个月，每一百吨原煤生产的净煤已达八十多吨。技术定额实际上提高了，原煤消耗得少了，而供应计划并没有根据这种生产情况的变化而改变，原煤就积压了很多。去年由于原煤质量不好，原煤消耗量增大，供应计划也未根据这种情况增加供应量，结果又曾一度发生原煤供应紧张的情况，影响了焦炭的生产。这种现象主要是因为技术管理和计划管理脱节。但如何从组织管理、工作制度和干部思想上来解决这一问题，至今并未进行研究或制定办法。因此原煤积压或供应紧张的情况还可能发生。
    二、有些可以解决的问题，误认为是不能解决或不应解决的，以解释代替了解决。铸造部涂油组工人曾提出应在小铁道上增设一个转盘，以利运输。车间对这个问题的处理意见是：目前没有转盘，暂时不能解决，由工长向工人进行解释。当工长向工人解释时，工人们已设法找到转盘，并把它安装好使用上了。全厂已处理的问题中，属于解释的问题（即办不到或不正确的意见）占56％以上。既然群众提的意见大部分是正确的，那末这些用解释来处理的问题是多了些。这里可能掩盖着不少应该解决或可以解决的问题，这都有待于进行检查，继续加以解决。
    三、很多干部的作风，经过群众的批评有了显著的转变，但也有部分干部还只是一般地向群众承认了错误，作了道歉式的检讨。所有被批评的干部还没有来得及从群众的批评中分析、检查缺点或错误产生的根源，在思想上提高一步；有的思想上还不通。因此，一部分干部还没有树立起新的作风；有些干部的作风虽然有了转变，但还没有从提高思想水平加以巩固。
    四、厂内这个单位转那个单位处理的问题，大部分还在转递途中。据铸造车间等七个单位的统计，转到有关单位处理的问题共二千一百四十七个，这些问题得到有关单位答复处理的只有四百三十七个，还有80％的问题没有转回到原单位向群众交代处理结果。
    五、工厂的管理机构进行了革命性的改革，但减少的人员还没有安排好，安排这些人需要进行细致的思想工作和组织工作。同时，适应新的管理机构的新的工作制度和方法等业务改革工作，以及这方面的思想工作，还需要大力去作。石景山钢铁厂目前的情况表明，这些工作，对于能不能彻底改进企业管理和巩固这种改革的成果，是非常重要的。
    石景山钢铁厂党委认为，在上述情况下展开大辩论，势必影响彻底地改进工作。因此，这个厂决定推迟大辩论的时间，并就如何彻底改进工作问题作了新的部署。其中主要是采取上下齐动手的方法，对处理群众意见和改进工作的情况再进行一次全面检查。各单位将召开两三次工会小组会听取职工们对改进工作的意见。可以解决而没有解决的问题，将要在大检查中全部解决。群众性的大检查中，将特别注意那些属于解释的问题和转有关单位处理的问题。但是，群众检查还只能是就具体问题检查具体问题，因此，石景山钢铁厂强调领导干部要亲自动手，系统地分析群众提的意见，检查改进工作的质量，提出本单位存在着哪些根本性的问题，应从哪些制度上或思想教育上去解决。在这个期间，并组织干部研究紧缩机构以后的工作制度和工作方法等问题。
    石景山钢铁厂整改的情况也表明，在整改阶段，要完全建立起防止整风中揭露出来的缺点、错误产生的制度，或者要使干部的思想问题完全解决以后再转入辩论也是不现实的，因为那需要比较长的时间和十分细致的工作。特别是思想建设工作，需要在整风末期才能进行。但是，整风中暴露的各种工作中的根本问题及其产生的原因，是必须弄清的，这是目前进行制度建设和将来进行思想建设的前提。
    同时，石景山钢铁厂根据对部分工人思想情况的初步调查，工人们最关心辩论的问题是同他们生活有直接关系的具体问题；在这些问题上，不正确的意见占了相当数量。因此，如何把具体问题的辩论引导到中共中央指示中的五个问题，如何培养辩论的骨干，树立正确意见的优势等等，还需要进行细致的工作，还需要好好地算几笔大账，准备有说服力的材料，以保证社会主义思想辩赢，保证全体职工在大辩论中大大地提高社会主义的觉悟。这方面的准备工作，正在积极进行中。
