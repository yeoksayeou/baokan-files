    November 7th and October 4th
    Deng Chumin

    The great victory achieved by the Soviet people on November 7, 1917, opened a new era in human history – a new era of transition from inhuman life to truly human life. After thousands of years of societies in which a minority exploited the majority and a minority oppressed the majority, a socialist country emerged on one-sixth of the world's land, a country without oppression or exploitation, where the working people are the masters of their own destiny. It pointed out the bright path of striving for democracy, freedom, and national liberation to all oppressed and enslaved people in the world, and all mankind will advance along this path – the socialist path. This is the immeasurable and enormous contribution of the Soviet people to mankind.

    The October Revolution is now forty years old. Over the past forty years, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have experienced severe war tests, defeated all kinds of enemies, overcome countless difficulties, completely changed the backwardness of the old Russia era, and leaped to become the most advanced and powerful industrial country in the world.

    The Soviet Union's construction in all aspects is progressing rapidly, developing by leaps and bounds, at a speed that no capitalist country in the world can match. Its total industrial output has increased 45 times in forty years, while in the same period the United States has only increased two and a half times, Britain only 1.1 times, and France only 2.2 times. The annual steel output is equal to one and a half times the total annual output of the old capitalist countries of Britain and France, second only to the United States. However, its annual absolute increase in output exceeds that of the United States. Soviet agriculture has been completely collectivized and mechanized, thoroughly changing the poverty and backwardness of peasants in the old Russia era, and embarked on the road to prosperity and happiness. Before the October Revolution, Russia was a country with a large number of illiterates, but now not only has illiteracy completely disappeared, but its publishing industry ranks first in the world. The Soviet Union has the largest number of scientific and technological experts in the world, and its scientific and technological development has surpassed the most developed capitalist countries in many aspects. The launch of the Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile once shocked the imperialist camp, and the appearance of artificial earth satellites caused even greater sensation around the world. The tremendous achievements the Soviet Union has made in these forty years have forced even the most arrogant and conceited US imperialism to admit that the Soviet Union is the most scientifically and technologically advanced country in the world.

    On October 4, 1957, the Soviet people successfully launched the first artificial earth satellite, opening a new era in human science – a new era of exploring the secrets of nature beyond the earth. Mankind has long had the ideal of conquering the universe, and now, after the tenacious labor of the Soviet working people and scientists, this ideal will gradually become a reality. The artificial earth satellite opened a gap to outer space, paving the way for human research on the universe and interstellar travel. This is another immeasurable and enormous contribution of the Soviet people to mankind.

    The serious significance of the Soviet artificial earth satellite lies not only in the enormous scientific research, but more importantly in politics and in defending world peace. Progressive people all over the world call this satellite the "peace satellite," believing that it is a powerful proof that the Soviet Union's science and technology absolutely surpasses the United States and possesses intercontinental ballistic missiles for defending world peace. It is a "major victory in the struggle for peace," a "victory of the idea of serving peace for mankind," and "this will make the aggressors have to consider more before launching a war." October 4, 1957, "will be forever recorded in human and scientific history, marking the beginning of the practical stage of conquering the universe."

    The Soviet artificial earth satellite is orbiting the earth day and night, and its voice symbolizing peace is constantly transmitted to the world. Progressive people all over the world are cheering for it, but it has caused "great surprise" and "anxiety" among the US ruling clique. The October 8th issue of the American "Newsweek" said: This "may represent a serious turning point in history," it said: "The satellite launched by the Soviet Union has scared the United States speechless." We believe that this is indeed "a serious turning point in history," this is a turning point in human civilization, this is a sign of the approaching death of imperialism and the great development of the socialist cause. This is the reason for the "great surprise" and "anxiety" of the US ruling clique. From now on, they can no longer carry out atomic blackmail, nor can they wantonly launch aggressive wars to plunder other countries' territories and enslave other countries' people for the money bags of monopoly capitalists.

    The artificial earth satellite has greatly promoted the upsurge of the national liberation movement, increased the confidence of progressive mankind in maintaining world peace, and given a good tranquilizer to the small group of warmongers in the US imperialism who believe in force and often boast of possessing various new types of killing weapons, which can make their minds clearer. They should consider what consequences will result from launching a war in this era of the highest development of science and technology.

    The artificial earth satellite also gave the bourgeois rightists in our country a strong slap in the face. The bourgeois rightists said: "Soviet science and technology are not as good as the United States," "The Communist Party cannot lead natural science." Now, this fallacy has completely gone bankrupt. The world's first artificial earth satellite was manufactured under the leadership of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the United States, so far, has not only failed to manufacture an artificial earth satellite, but even lacks intercontinental ballistic missiles. Rightist gentlemen, whose science and technology is ahead? If you still close your eyes and say you haven't seen it, then turn on the radio and listen!

    The brilliant achievements the Soviet Union has made in socialist construction and science and technology are not accidental. Since the victory of the October Revolution, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has adhered to the path of Marxism-Leninism, which is: under the leadership of the Communist Party, realize the dictatorship of the proletariat, realize the worker-peasant alliance, and the road of free and equal national friendship. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union unswervingly safeguards the fundamental interests of the working people and is always loyal to the cause of socialism. It fully promotes democracy in the country's political life, ensuring that the people can regularly participate in the country's management; in economic construction, it follows Lenin's principle of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, strives to complete national industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and cultural revolution, and continuously improves the people's living standards. At the same time, the productive forces of the Soviet Union have been unprecedentedly liberated after the October Revolution, and economic construction has a broad world, thus achieving unprecedented great development. Millions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals have the opportunity to fully display their talents in this free and vast world. They work for their own interests rather than for the money bags of the capitalists. They consciously display their organization, discipline, unity, and revolutionary enthusiasm in realizing the greatest ideal of mankind - building a socialist society, forming a spiritual and political unity of the entire people. Therefore, the Soviet Union's construction and science and technology can catch up with and surpass the most advanced capitalist countries and rank first in the world in a very short period of time. Now, the Soviet Union has not only built a socialist society, but is also advancing towards a communist society by leaps and bounds. From this, it can be seen that the socialist system has unparalleled vitality and superiority.

    The light of the October Revolution shines on all oppressed nations, and the Soviet Union's tremendous achievements in building socialism have inspired peace-loving people all over the world. Now, not only have many socialist countries emerged in the world, but socialist ideas have shown increasing appeal and are becoming more and more deeply rooted in the hearts of the workers, peasants, and intellectuals in capitalist countries. Under the influence of the October Revolution, the world anti-colonialism movement continues to surge. Now, the colonial system has begun to disintegrate, and the colonialists are already tottering. But the imperialists are not reconciled to their defeat. On the one hand, they are stepping up the suppression of the working people in their own countries, and on the other hand, they want to launch wars and engage in subversion activities in order to maintain colonial rule. But with a powerful Soviet Union and a united and unbreakable socialist camp in the world, the imperialists' conspiracy will never succeed.

    The victory of our people's revolution was developed under the direct influence of the October Revolution. The October Revolution not only pointed out the direction and path of struggle for us, but also sent us Marxism-Leninism, this invincible revolutionary weapon. From then on, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our people developed and advanced along the revolutionary direction of the Soviet Union - the socialist direction, and finally achieved victory. The brilliant achievements our people have made in just eight years are inseparable from the Soviet Union's assistance and learning from the Soviet Union's construction experience. From the very beginning of the founding of New China, the Soviet Union has helped China carry out socialist construction through various means such as loans, dispatching experts, and supplying equipment, laying a good foundation for China's industrialization. The Soviet Union is not only an advanced socialist country with forty years of construction experience, but also the path it has taken is a common avenue for mankind. The Chinese Communist Party regards its own cause as a continuation of the October Revolution, and the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. Therefore, we must continue to learn from the Soviet Union, learn, learn, and learn again. The Soviet Union will always be our most reliable teacher and most loyal friend. The Soviet Union's victory is our victory, and the Soviet Union's festival is our festival. Further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and our cause will forever advance victoriously.

    November 7, 1917, and October 4, 1957, these two extraordinary days will be forever recorded in history. The guarantee of the victory of the October Revolution will be as solid as a rock, and the future of mankind's beautiful and happy life will be "like the sun in the sky."

    十一月七日和十月四日
    邓初民
    苏联人民在1917年11月7日所取得的伟大胜利，开辟了人类历史的新纪元——从非人生活转到真正的人的生活的新纪元。人类在经过了几千年少数人剥削多数人、少数人压迫多数人的社会之后，在世界六分之一的土地上出现了一个没有压迫、没有剥削、以劳动人民当家作主的社会主义国家。它给世界上一切被压迫、被奴役的人民指出了争取民主、自由和民族解放的光明大道，整个人类都将沿着这条道路——社会主义道路前进。这是苏联人民对人类无可估量的巨大贡献。
    十月革命至今已经整整四十年了。四十年来苏联人民在伟大的苏联共产党的领导之下，经历了严重的战争考验，战胜了各种各样的敌人，克服了无数困难，完全改变了旧俄时代的落后状况，一跃而为世界上最先进的强大工业国。
    苏联在各方面的建设都是突飞猛进，一日千里的发展着，这种速度是世界上任何一个资本主义国家都不能比拟的。它的工业总产量在四十年中增加了四十五倍，而在同一时期美国只增加了两倍半，英国只增加了一点一倍，法国只增加了二点二倍。钢铁的年产量等于老牌资本主义的英国和法国年产量总和的一倍半，仅次于美国。但在每年的绝对增产量上却超过了美国。苏联的农业已经完全集体化和机械化，彻底改变了农民在旧俄时代的贫困和落后状况，走上了富裕幸福的道路。十月革命前，俄国是一个文盲众多的国家，现在不仅文盲完全绝迹，而且它的出版事业占世界第一位。苏联拥有世界上最多的科学技术专家，它的科学技术的发展，在许多方面都超过了最发达的资本主义国家。苏联洲际弹道火箭的发射曾经震撼了帝国主义阵营，而人造地球卫星的出现则更加轰动了全世界。苏联在这四十年中所获得的巨大成就，即使最骄傲自大、狂妄无比的美帝国主义也不得不承认苏联是世界上科学技术最先进的国家。
    1957年10月4日，苏联人民成功地发射了第一颗人造地球卫星，开辟了人类科学的新纪元——探求地球以外的大自然的秘密的新纪元。人类早就有征服宇宙的理想，现在，这一理想在经过苏联劳动人民和科学家的顽强劳动之后，将逐渐成为现实。人造地球卫星向宇宙空间打开了一个缺口，为人类研究宇宙、星际旅行开辟了道路。这是苏联人民对人类又一无可估量的巨大贡献。
    苏联人造地球卫星的严重意义不仅在于巨大的科学研究上，更重要的是在政治上，在保卫世界和平上。全世界进步人类把这颗卫星叫作“和平卫星”，认为它是苏联的科学技术绝对超过美国和拥有保卫世界和平的洲际弹道火箭的一个有力的证明，是人类“在争取和平的斗争中取得了重大的胜利”，是“人类为和平服务的思想的胜利”，“这将使侵略者在发动战争之前不得不作更多的考虑”，1957年10月4日“将永垂人类和科学史册，它标志着征服宇宙的实践阶段的开始”。
    苏联人造地球卫星正在日日夜夜地绕着地球运行，它的象征着和平的声音不断传到人间。全世界进步人类为它而欢欣鼓舞，但它在美国统治集团中却引起了“非常吃惊”和“焦虑”。10月8日的美国“新闻周刊”说：这“可能表示历史上的一个严重转折点”，它说：“苏联发射的卫星已经把美国吓得一下讲不出话”来。我们认为这确实是“历史上的一个严重转折点”，这是人类文明的转折点，这是帝国主义接近死亡和社会主义事业大发展的标志。美国统治集团的“非常吃惊”和“焦虑”的原因就在这里。从今以后，他们再不能进行原子讹诈，再不能为了垄断资本家的钱袋去掠夺别国领土和奴役别国人民而随心所欲地发动侵略战争。
    人造地球卫星大大促进民族解放运动的高涨，增加了进步人类维护世界和平的信心，给那一小撮迷信武力、经常吹嘘拥有各种新式杀人武器的美帝国主义好战分子下了一服良好的镇静剂，可以使他们的头脑清醒一些。他们应该考虑到，处在这个科学技术最高发展的时代，发动战争将会得到怎样的后果。
    人造地球卫星也给我国资产阶级右派分子一记强有力的耳光。资产阶级右派分子说：“苏联的科学技术没有美国好”，“共产党不能领导自然科学”。现在，这种谬论完全破产了。世界上第一颗人造地球卫星是在伟大的苏联共产党的领导下制造出来的，而美国到目前为止，不但制造不出人造地球卫星，甚至连洲际弹道火箭也没有。右派先生们，到底谁的科学技术走在前头？如果你们仍闭着眼睛说没有看见，那么，你们就打开收音机听一听吧！
    苏联在社会主义建设和科学技术上所获得的辉煌成就并不是偶然的。自从十月革命胜利后，苏联共产党坚持走马克思列宁主义的道路，这条道路就是：在共产党的领导下实现无产阶级专政，实现工农联盟和自由平等的民族友好的道路。苏联共产党坚持不渝地维护劳动人民的根本利益，始终忠于社会主义事业。在国家政治生活中充分发扬民主，保证人民可以经常参加国家的管理工作；在经济建设上，遵循着列宁优先发展重工业的原则，努力完成国家工业化、农业集体化和文化革命，不断地提高人民的生活水平。同时，十月革命后苏联的生产力得到了前所未有的大解放，经济建设有了广阔的天地，从而得到了空前的大发展。千百万工人、农民、知识分子在这个自由宽广的天地里有充分发挥才智的机会，他们为了自己的利益而不是为资本家的钱袋而工作，在实现人类最伟大的理想——建设社会主义社会中自觉地发挥出他们的组织性、纪律性、团结性和革命积极性，形成了全体人民在精神上和政治上的一致。因此，苏联的建设和科学技术能够在很短的时间内追上并超过最先进的资本主义国家而占世界第一位。现在，苏联不但已经建成了社会主义社会，而且正在大踏步地向着共产主义社会前进。从这里可以看出，社会主义制度具有无比巨大的生命力和优越性。
    十月革命的光芒照耀着所有被压迫的民族，苏联建设社会主义的巨大成就鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民。现在，世界上不但出现了许多社会主义国家，而且社会主义思想在资本主义国家的工人、农民和知识分子中显出了越来越大的吸引力，越来越深入人心。在十月革命的影响下，世界反殖民主义运动不断高涨，现在，殖民主义体系已经开始瓦解，殖民主义者已经摇摇欲坠了。但帝国主义者还不甘心自己的失败，他们一方面加紧镇压本国的劳动人民，一方面想为保持殖民统治而发动战争和搞颠复活动。可是世界上有了一个强大的苏联，有了一个团结一致的牢不可破的社会主义阵营，帝国主义的阴谋就永远不会得逞。
    我国人民革命的胜利是在十月革命的直接影响下发展起来的。十月革命不但给我们指出了斗争的方向和道路，而且还给我们送来了马克思列宁主义这个战无不胜的革命武器。从此，我国人民在中国共产党的领导下沿着苏联的革命方向——社会主义方向发展、前进，并且最后取得了胜利。我国人民在短短的八年中所取得的辉煌成就，是和苏联的援助和学习苏联的建设经验分不开的。从新中国一成立时起，苏联就通过贷款、派遣专家和供应设备等各种方式，帮助我国进行社会主义建设，为我国工业化打下了一个良好的基础。苏联不仅是先进的社会主义国家，有着四十年的建设经验，同时，它所经历的道路是人类共同的康庄大道，中国共产党把自己所进行的事业看作是十月革命的继续，苏联的今天就是我们的明天，因此，我们必须继续不断地向苏联学习，学习、学习、再学习。苏联永远是我们最可靠的老师和最忠实的朋友。苏联的胜利就是我们的胜利，苏联的节日就是我们的节日。更进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，我们的事业就会永远胜利前进。
    1917年11月7日和1957年10月4日这两个不平凡的日子将一同永垂史册，十月革命胜利的保障将坚如磐石，人类美好幸福生活的前途将“如日中天”。
