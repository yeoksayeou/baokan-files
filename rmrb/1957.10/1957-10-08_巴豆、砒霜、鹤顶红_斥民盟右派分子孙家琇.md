Croton, Arsenic, Hemlock
——Denouncing Sun Jiaxiu, a Rightist Element of the China Democratic League
Cao Yu

In the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, I knew few of the targets of the revolution. In the anti-Rightist struggle, I suddenly discovered that I knew quite a few Rightist elements. This shows that the revolution has become more profound, and it also shows that some people say "socialism" with their mouths, but their hearts are capitalist. Today, they must be consistent in their words and deeds in front of the masses. If you don't support socialism, then go with us; if you do, then hold onto the "capitalist tablet" and "remain chaste" alone. Many of these Rightists are senior intellectuals, hypocritical and behaving despicably. They always talk about "ideals" and "struggle," but their hearts are tightly wrapped around extremely decadent bourgeois individualism that reeks. And these people are senior intellectuals to whom the masses had entrusted great hope, experts whom the masses thought could be socialist assets. But they disappointed us, deceived us, they are Rightist elements.

I have a nineteen-year-old daughter. She participated in a rally against Rightist elements, the target being a professor. When she came back, she said to me, "Dad, we trusted him so much, but he is so unreliable, he deceived us!..." She was very angry and speechless. After a while, she suddenly said, "Dad, when will we have our own senior intellectuals and experts?"

It is their greatest sin that these so-called senior intellectuals make innocent children so sad!

Who are the "our own senior intellectuals" that my daughter refers to? That refers to senior intellectuals who are loyal to the revolution, love the Party, and love socialism. We welcome them from any background, whether bourgeois or petty-bourgeois. Since liberation, we have cultivated many outstanding senior intellectuals from worker-peasant backgrounds. The Party always extends its hands to old intellectuals who are not from worker-peasant backgrounds, helping them to truly embark on the road of socialist transformation. The Party uses various methods to cultivate, educate, care for, and encourage them, letting them participate in various life experiences to abandon the old and establish the new, becoming experts who meet the needs of the people. But there is a small group of scum, a small group of stinking things, dragging the corpses from their coffins, unwilling to let go, and during the great "blooming and contending," they revealed their true colors. They are no longer a group of refined "professors" and "scholars," but exposed their fangs, wagging their tongues, soulless dogs and wolves to the people.

Among this group of people is the Rightist element Sun Jiaxiu, she is the central figure of the China Democratic League Rightist conspiratorial clique in the Central Academy of Drama. I would like to talk about her speech at the Central Academy of Drama, focusing on one or two points. The title of that speech was "Disillusioned and Still Hoping." This title is very similar to the awkward and obscure sentences of Hu Feng. This female general dresses herself up as a holy figure like a prophet in the Old Testament, summoning people to repent. After much beating around the bush, the central idea is to overthrow the Communist Party and let her lead us on the capitalist road. Her tone is truly arrogant and rampant, reminding me of Tan Tiwu. They are both so arrogant, seeing the Party as a thorn in their side, vicious female generals who will not be content until it is removed.

All Rightist senior intellectuals like to boast that they have "ideals." Sun Jiaxiu also said: "In the past, I pursued all kinds of ideals. Finally, I came to know the Communist Party and placed my ideals on the truth of the Communist Party. This is an ideal that I am willing to sacrifice everything to defend, an ideal that no one can shake or destroy. This is the ideal for which all the masses are willing to sacrifice everything to fight for. But, Party members!"

Then, all kinds of poisonous smoke and gas are spewed out at us. She said that the behavior of Party members today has shaken her "ideals," that today the masses believe that being a Party member is not honorable, that everything will fall into chaos! Today's Party members "deprive people of their ideals, stifle people's ambition, block the vitality of young people, and deceive the faith of students." She loudly appealed, calling on everyone to "rise up and punish them." Because, she said, she "loves the Communist Party," she "believes in the Party," she is a true Marxist.

But is this person, called "the Yago in a skirt," really a Marxist?

When I was studying, I met an old man who was a secretary-general in the warlord era. As soon as he saw me, he cursed communism, saying that Marx's theory was not worth refuting. I verbally disagreed with him, but in my heart, I knew he was a liar.

When I grew a little older, I met his son, who had studied abroad and even obtained a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia. He praised communism to me, saying that it was the highest ideal of mankind, and that even he wanted to fight for communism, "It's just a pity that the doctrine is good, but the people are bad; communism is good, but the Communist Party members are bad." He sighed and worried about the country and the people. It was clear that he was much more "clever" than his father, but I knew that this was a complete liar! He had studied abroad and knew a little more about the world situation than his father, knowing that communism could not be overthrown. But by seizing on one or two shortcomings and problems of Communist Party members, he portrayed the entire Communist Party as "bad guys." People who have never seen a Communist Party member are easily convinced.

Sun Jiaxiu is this kind of person. But she made the wrong calculation. Today's people have personally witnessed what the Communist Party has done for socialist construction. In all aspects—science, culture, education, health, transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, light and heavy industry, and national defense construction—the Party's achievements are major, unprecedented, world-renowned, feared by imperialists, and rejoiced by peace-loving people. And these achievements are the result of the hard work of all Communist Party members and the people under the leadership of the Party Central Committee. But a small handful of scum like Sun Jiaxiu insist on putting on a compassionate appearance, wanting to fight to defend her personal and the "masses'" "ideals"; as if she is standing with the masses, and her "ideals" are the ideals of the masses.

What are her "ideals"? Now it is clear. She wants to build the two "good" schools in her mind in today's China. One is the Nanjing Drama Academy run by the Kuomintang, which she thinks is "good," and the spirit of the Nanjing Drama Academy should be "restored." The other is Mills College in the United States, where she studied, which she thinks is "good," and she wants to transplant that kind of environment to China. The Nanjing Drama Academy was run by Kuomintang party hacks Zhang Daofan, Yu Shangyuan, and the Er Chen system. I saw Kuomintang people rampant and domineering, the party spirit was overwhelming, and secret agents were rampant. Progressive teachers and students were arrested, beaten, and framed. Where was there any talk of an academic atmosphere! As for Mills College, it was established for many wealthy American ladies. It has various ways to train these ladies to comfortably exploit people under a very smooth and beautiful surface. This type of girls' school cultivates American wives and bosses' wives who are decorations. Think about it, who would be happy if this kind of environment were moved to today's China? Would the comprador bourgeoisie be happy? Or would the workers and peasants be happy? But all of this is just the outer shell of her ideals. The dagger revealed at the end is to have the Party and the Youth League withdraw from the Central Academy of Drama. Even if we take a step back, the Communist Party can only, as she said, manage her so-called "ideological work." She and her China Democratic League conspiratorial clique want to exclusively manage teaching, finance, and personnel. And Sun Jiaxiu, according to her own words, wants to "be the emperor emeritus" above all of this. Think about it, they still say they want to "beautify the human soul" and "fight to beautify human life." People can't help but ask: Do these "professors" and "experts" have souls at all? Are they trying to beautify our lives, or uglify them?

Sun Jiaxiu's speech reveals a deep-seated hatred for us. She curses us in this way, saying that it is "because we are grateful to you (referring to the Communist Party) for healing the various bourgeois defects on our bodies in the past," so they want to cure our illnesses today. We have treated her illnesses, gently, wholeheartedly, and very kindly, but we have not cured her. Today she wants to "cure" our illnesses. What medicine is she using? She is using croton, arsenic, and hemlock. She hopes that one dose of medicine will "cure" us to death. She is a "Shakespeare expert," and when she curses people, she wants to be refined, spouting Shakespeare. She said that the Central Academy of Drama is full of "weeds, burdock, lizards, and poisonous insects." These things all refer to us. This is her "Shakespeare." She said she "encountered the tragedy of Othello," even "a tragedy more tragic than Othello." Othello is a brave, sincere, noble, and passionate black general, whom she uses as a self-comparison. This is also her "Shakespeare." She said that we "hang a sheep's head but sell dog meat," she said that we are "ignorant and incompetent, posing as authorities," saying that we "use hypocrisy to replace sincerity, to replace Party spirit," and also twistedly satirized and ridiculed, and said many witty remarks. Finally, she brought out Shakespeare's "Sonnets" to give us a mirror.

We don't need her to bring a mirror for us to look at. The masses have already given us one. The masses can see clearly that under the leadership of the Party, the Central Academy of Drama has gone from nothing to something, from something to big, from crude to refined, from simple to a relatively complete educational institution. This academy has trained the nation's outstanding directors, performers, and stage artists, introduced the Stanislavski system of the Soviet Union, and for the first time systematically and successfully trained graduates in all aspects of drama. It and its experimental theater have performed some excellent, world-significant, and socialist-content plays relatively perfectly. The Central Academy of Drama is the first higher institution of drama under the leadership of the Communist Party in history. And these achievements, the achievements she does not want to see, are the leadership comrades of the Party in this academy and other comrades, under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture, day and night, working hard, sincerely, and earning them bit by bit. And she, on the sidelines, brings out Shakespeare's "Sonnets":

"Tired with all these, for restful death I cry, -
As, to behold desert a beggar born,
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
And strength by limping sway disabled,
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
And captive good attending captain ill:
Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone."

(According to the translation she quoted)

I am not a Shakespeare expert, but I believe that Shakespeare was an honest person, a person who said good when he saw light, and said bad when he saw darkness, a person who liked good people and hated bad people, a person who distinguished right from wrong and hated evil like an enemy. It was reasonable and appropriate for Shakespeare to write such a sonnet cursing British society three hundred years ago in England, proving that Shakespeare was upright. But today, this female professor, female Shakespeare expert, quotes Shakespeare's poem to curse today's Chinese society, proving that she is a completely evil and unrighteous person. She insulted Shakespeare and misused his poems. Shakespeare left a total of one hundred and fifty-four "Sonnets." If he knew that this female professor had quoted his poem in this way, he would definitely stand up angrily from his grave and write the one hundred and fifty-fifth to curse her, the first two lines being:

You ignorant witch, why do you take away my dead rest?
You even use the people in the grave, you cursed thing!

Pride and self-satisfaction, flaunting oneself everywhere, is a common ailment of Rightist senior intellectuals. Knowing a little Shakespeare, they Shakespeare flies all over the sky, afraid that people don't know that they have read Shakespeare, it's really ugly!

This female professor claims to be the "captive 'good'," "attending" us "‘ill’ captains." But when she is fighting bare-chested and risking her life to attack the Party, she sweetly says to us: "Comrades, dear Communist Party comrades, we love you, we are also incompetent, and our virtues are not great, but we rely on our love!"

It sounds like an American missionary preaching to Chinese people with broken Chinese.

On the surface, she looks like a silky candy, but inside it is croton, arsenic, and hemlock. She is extremely hypocritical, this "Pharisee!" [Note]

Before attacking the Party, she was "studying hard" Marxism-Leninism. She said that she thanked Marxism-Leninism for teaching her to see problems "dialectically." Therefore, she believes that she understands the "inside story" and sets fire to the Communist Party. In Greek mythology, a hero suffered great pain and torment because he took fire from the sky to the human world. The people therefore forever sing the praises of this great fire-taker. And this female general originally intended to learn how to start a fire from the fire-taker from the very beginning, and her purpose was to burn the great fire-taker to death. This is the most unfathomable aspect of those who are always of two minds with us.

Of course, even so, we still hope that Sun Jiaxiu will repent and start anew. In the new society, decayed wood can sprout green buds: Rightist elements can be reborn as long as they sincerely and thoroughly change their position.

Note: Pharisee is a hypocrite mentioned in the Bible.

    巴豆、砒霜、鹤顶红
    ——斥民盟右派分子孙家琇
    曹禺
    在三反、肃反当中，革命的对象和我认识的还少。在反右派斗争中我忽然发现，很有一些右派分子是我认识的。可见革命更深入了，也可见有些人嘴里是“社会主义”，心里是资本主义，到了今天，他们必须在群众面前心口合一了。你要不，拥护社会主义，那就和我们一道走；要不，你就抱着“资本主义牌位”，一个人“守节”去吧。这些右派，很多是高级知识分子，口是心非，行为卑鄙。他们嘴上总是“理想啊”，“奋斗啊”这一类好听的话，心里却是包得紧紧的，里面发臭的极端腐朽的资产阶级个人主义。而这些人是群众曾寄托很大希望的高级知识分子，是群众以为可以做社会主义的财富的专家。然而他们使我们失望，欺骗了我们，他们是右派分子。
    我有一个十九岁的女儿，她参加过反右派分子大会，对象是一个教授。她回来对我说：“爸爸，我们这样信赖他，可是他这样靠不住，欺骗了我们！……”她非常气愤，说不出话来，半天她忽然说：“爸爸，什么时候才有我们自己的高级知识分子和专家啊？”
    这些所谓高级知识分子使天真无邪的孩子们这样伤心，真是他们最大的罪恶！
    我那女儿所指的“我们自己的高级知识分子”是什么人呢？那是指忠于革命、爱党、爱社会主义的高级知识分子。无论从那个方面来，从资产阶级或者从小资产阶级，我们都是欢迎的。解放以后，我们已经培养出许多优秀的工农出身的高级知识分子。对工农以外的旧知识分子党永远是伸出双手，帮助他们真正走上社会主义改造的道路。党用各种办法培养，教育，照顾，鼓励，让他们参加各种生活的锻炼，来抛弃旧的、建立新的，成为一个合乎人民要求的专家。然而有一小群败类，一小群发臭的东西，拖着棺材里的尸骨，死不愿放，在大“鸣”大“放”的时候，他们露出了原形。他们不再是一群文绉绉的“教授”“学者”，而是露出长牙，摇着舌头，对人民毫无心肝的狗和狼。
    在这群人当中，就有右派分子孙家琇，她是中央戏剧学院民盟右派阴谋小集团的中心人物。我想仅就她在中央戏剧学院的发言，从一两个地方谈一谈。那个发言的题目叫“幻灭了的及还希望着的”。这个题目十分像胡风那种佶屈聱牙的句子。这位女将把自己打扮成一个旧约圣经里的先知召唤人们忏悔的圣洁模样。绕了半天，中心的意思不过是要推翻共产党，让她来领着我们走资本主义的道路。她的口气真是狂妄嚣张极了，使我想起谭惕吾来。她们都是那样不可一世的，把党看成眼中钉，非要拔去才心甘的凶恶女将。
    一切右派高级知识分子都好夸耀自己有“理想”。孙家琇也说：“过去我追求过各式各样的理想，最后认识共产党，把理想寄托在共产党真理上。这是愿意牺牲一切来维护的理想，是任何人不能动摇，不能摧毁的。这是所有的群众不惜牺牲一切而为之奋斗的理想。可是党员们啊！”
    于是，一切毒烟毒气就向我们喷射出来。她说，今天党员的行为动摇了她的“理想”，今天群众认为做党员不光彩，今天一切将陷于混沌！今天的党员“剥夺人的理想，窒息了人的事业心，堵塞了青年人的朝气，欺骗了学生们的信仰”，她大声疾呼，号召大家“群起而诛之”。因为她说，她“热爱共产党”，她“相信党”，她是真正的马克思主义者。
    然而这个被称为“穿裙子的亚高”的人，真是一个马克思主义者吗？
    我读书的时候见过一个老头儿，他是军阀时代的一个秘书长。他一见我就骂共产主义，说马克思的理论根本不值一驳。我嘴里说不服他，但我心里知道他是一个骗子。
    待我大了一点，我遇见了他的儿子，他是留过学的，在哥伦比亚还得了什么哲学博士。他对我满口称赞共产主义，说这是人类最高的理想，连他也要为共产主义而奋斗，“就是可惜，主义好，人不好；共产主义好，共产党员不好”。他唉声叹气，忧国忧民。看得出来，他比他的父亲是“高明”多了，但我知道，这才是一个十足的骗子！他留过学，比他父亲多懂一点世界大势，知道共产主义无法推倒。但抓一两个共产党员的缺点、毛病，就把共产党全部说成是“坏蛋”。没有见过共产党的人是容易相信的。
    孙家琇就是这种人。然而她打错了主意，今天的人民亲眼看见共产党为社会主义建设做的事情。无论哪方面，科学、文化、教育、卫生、交通、水利、农业、轻重工业和国防建设，党的成就都是主要的，空前的，全世界注目的，帝国主义害怕的，爱和平的人们高兴的。而这些成就是在党中央的领导下全体共产党员和人民的劳动换来的。然而一小撮像孙家琇这种败类，偏要装做一副悲天悯人的样子，要为保卫她个人和“群众”的“理想”而战斗；仿佛，她是和群众站在一起的，她的“理想”就是群众的理想。
    她的“理想”是什么呢？现在弄清楚了。她要把她心目中的两个“好”学校在今天的中国建立起来。一个是国民党办的南京剧专，她觉得“好”，南京剧专的那种精神应该“复辟”。一个是她读过书的美国的密尔斯女子学院，她觉得“好”，要把那样的环境移植到中国来。南京剧专是国民党党棍张道藩、余上沅和二陈系统的人办的。我在里面看见国民党人横行霸道，党气冲天，特务横行。进步师生被逮捕，被殴打，被陷害，哪里谈到什么学术空气！至于密尔斯女子学院，那是为很多美国有钱的小姐们设立的，它有各种办法训练这些小姐们在很光滑、美观的表面下，舒舒服服地剥削人。这一类女子学校都是培养做装饰品的美国太太和老板娘的。想想看，这种环境如果搬到今天的中国来，是谁高兴？是买办资产阶级高兴？还是工农高兴？然而这一切都不过是她的理想的外壳，那图穷的匕首，是要党团退出中央戏剧学院。退一万步说，共产党也只能，如她说的，管她所谓的“思想工作”，她和她的民盟阴谋小集团要独管教学、财政和人事。而孙家琇呢，据她自己说，是想在这一切之上“做太上皇”的。想想看，他们还说要“美化人类的灵魂”，“要为美化人类的生活而奋斗”。人们不禁要问：这些“教授”、“专家”们到底有灵魂没有？他们是要美化我们的生活，还是丑化我们的生活？
    孙家琇的发言透出一种对我们刻骨的仇恨。她这样诅咒我们，她说，是“因为感谢你们（指共产党）过去医治了我们身上种种资产阶级的缺陷”，因此他们今天要起来治治我们的病。我们是治过她的病的，温和，尽心，非常善意地治过她的病，但是没有治好。今天她要“治”我们的病来了。她用的是什么药呢？她用的是巴豆、砒霜、鹤顶红。她希望一剂药就把我们“治”死。她是“莎士比亚专家”，咒骂起人来也要斯斯文文，口吐莎士比亚。她说中央戏剧学院到处都是“莠草、牛蒡草、蜥蜴、毒虫”。这些东西都指的是我们。这是她的“莎士比亚”。她说她“碰见了奥赛罗的悲剧”，甚至“比奥赛罗更悲剧的悲剧”。奥赛罗是一个勇敢、真诚、高贵、热情的黑人将军，是她引以自喻的，这也是她的“莎士比亚”。她说我们“挂羊头卖狗肉”，她说我们“不学无术，冒充权威”，说我们“用虚伪代替真诚，代替党性”，还曲曲弯弯地讽刺、讥笑，说了许多俏皮话。最后她又搬出莎士比亚的“十四行诗”，说要给我们照照镜子。
    镜子是不用她拿来给我们照的。群众已经给我们照了。群众看得清清楚楚，在党的领导下，中央戏剧学院从无到有，从有到大，从粗糙到细致，从简单发展到一个比较完善的教育机构。这个学院训练了全国的优秀的导演、表演和舞台美术的人才，介绍了苏联的史坦尼拉夫斯基体系，第一次比较有系统、有成绩地训练出戏剧各方面的毕业生。它和它的实验话剧院比较完美地演出了一些优秀的、有世界意义的、有社会主义内容的剧目。中央戏剧学院是有史以来第一个在共产党的领导下话剧的最高学府。而这些成绩，她所不愿意看见的成绩，就是这个学院党的领导同志们和其他同志们在文化部的领导下，日日夜夜，辛苦地劳动，诚诚恳恳，一点一滴地争得的。而她呢，她在一旁引起莎士比亚的“十四行诗”来：
    “对这些我都厌倦了，我哭求安息的死——譬如，见到才能注定要做乞丐，空虚的无物倒打扮得漂漂亮亮，最纯洁的信仰被不幸地破坏，灿烂的荣誉被可耻的放错了地位，处女般的贞洁遭到强奸，邪恶，不法地侮辱了正义的完美，艺术，被权威捆住了口舌，愚蠢（俨如博士）控制着学术，单纯的真理被瞎唤作呆笨，被俘的‘善’侍候着‘恶’将军：对这些都倦了，我要离开人间，只是，我死了，要使我爱人孤单。”
        （根据她引的译文）
    我不是莎士比亚专家，但我相信，莎士比亚是一个诚实的人，是一个见着光明就说好，见着黑暗就说坏的人，是一个见着好人就喜欢，见着坏人就厌恶的人，是一个是非分明、嫉恶如仇的人。莎士比亚在三百年前的英国，写刚才引的那样一首十四行诗，诅咒当时的英国社会，是合情合理的，证明莎士比亚是正直的。但是今天这位女教授，女莎士比亚专家引用莎士比亚的这首诗来诅咒今天的中国社会，便证明她是一个十足邪恶的、毫无正气的人。她侮辱了莎士比亚，滥用了他的诗篇。莎士比亚一共留下一百五十四首“十四行诗”。如果他知道了这位女教授这样引用了他的诗，他一定从坟墓里愤怒地站起来，写第一百五十五首来诅咒她，那头两句便是：
    你这无知的女妖，你为何夺去我死去的安息？
    连坟墓里的人你都拿来利用，你这该诅咒的！
    骄傲、自满，处处炫耀自己，是右派高级知识分子的通病。知道一点莎士比亚，就莎士比亚满天飞，生怕人不知道自己读过莎士比亚，真是丑！
    这位女教授是自命为“被俘的‘善’”，“侍候着”我们这些“‘恶’将军”的。但她在赤膊上阵、拼死拼活地向党进攻的时候，却又甜言蜜语地对我们说：“同志们，亲爱的共产党员同志们，我们热爱你们，我们也是无术，德行也不大，但凭着我们的热爱！”
    听起来，真像一个美国传道教士咬着夹生的中国话，向中国人布道一样。
    她表面看去像是一块丝光糖果，里面却是巴豆、砒霜、鹤顶红。她伪善到了极点，这个“法里赛”！（注）
    她向党进攻之前，是“死钻”马列主义的。她说，感谢马列主义已经教会她“辩证的”看问题了。因此，她认为自己懂得“内幕”，便向共产党点起火来。希腊神话里有一个英雄遭受了巨大的痛苦和折磨，因为他从天上取了火种给人间。人民因此永远歌颂这个伟大的取火者。而这位女将原来一开始便存心从取火者学会举火，其目的是为了烧死那伟大的取火者的。这便是那种和我们始终是两条心的人最深不可测的地方。
    自然，即使如此，我们还希望孙家琇憣然悔悟，重新做人。在新社会里，朽木能生出绿芽：右派分子只要诚诚恳恳，彻底改变立场，他是可以再生的。
    注：法里赛是圣经里说的伪善者。
