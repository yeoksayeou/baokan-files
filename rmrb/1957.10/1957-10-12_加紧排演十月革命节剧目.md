　　Intensify Rehearsals for October Revolution Day Performances
　　In recent days, actors at the Beijing People's Art Theater have been rehearsing the famous Soviet play "The Man with a Gun," which reflects the great October Revolution. The Moscow Art Theater also sent the theater production photos and written materials introducing the play.
　　Actors at the Central Academy of Drama's Experimental Theater are also rushing to rehearse the famous Soviet play "Storm of Revolution." This play depicts the intellectual landscape during the turbulent revolutionary era of 1916-1918. Professor Polyezhaev, at the age of seventy-four, finally finds the path of revolution in his restless later years and dedicates himself to the cause of the proletariat. Only under the Soviet regime can he complete his scientific ideals. The drama also reveals the opposing outlooks on life and worldviews of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie through the different paths in life of two young people.
　　The Central People's Broadcasting Station's Radio Drama Troupe has begun rehearsing three radio dramas and a set of recitation evening programs. The radio drama "Matchmaking," provided by Moscow Radio, is a comedy. The play lively and humorously portrays the new moral qualities of Soviet people. Another radio drama, "Pavel Korchagin at Boyarka Station," is adapted from the first, second, and third sections of the famous Soviet novel "How the Steel Was Tempered." It depicts the sharp class struggle during the construction period of the Soviet regime and the attitude of Communist Youth League members toward physical labor. The radio drama "Fog" is a novella written by Soviet writer Polevoy. Through the intimate conversation of two women, it reflects the high labor enthusiasm of the builders of the great Lenin-Volga-Don Canal project.
　　These programs will all be staged or broadcast in Beijing around the time of the October Revolution Day.

　　加紧排演十月革命节剧目
    连日来，北京人民艺术剧院的演员正排演反映伟大十月革命的苏联名剧“带枪的人”，莫斯科艺术剧院还给这个剧院寄来介绍这个剧的剧照和文字资料。
    中央戏剧学院实验话剧院的演员也在赶排苏联名剧“革命的风浪”。这个戏描绘了1916—1918年革命动荡的大时代中知识分子的思想面貌。波列查耶夫老教授在他七十四岁不平静的晚年，终于找到了革命的道路，把自己献身给无产阶级的事业；也只有在苏维埃政权下，他才能完成了自己的科学理想。戏剧还通过两个青年人的不同的生活道路，揭示了无产阶级与资产阶级对立的人生观和世界观。
    中央人民广播电台广播剧团已着手排演三个广播剧和一组朗诵的晚会节目。由莫斯科电台供稿的广播剧“相亲”是个喜剧。剧中活泼而风趣的表现了苏维埃人的新的道德品质。另一个广播剧“保尔·柯察金在波耶卡车站”，是根据苏联著名小说“钢铁是怎样炼成的”第二部第一、二、三节改编的。它刻画了苏维埃政权建设时期尖锐的阶级斗争，以及共青团员对待体力劳动的态度。广播剧“雾”是苏联作家波列伏依写的一篇小说。它通过两个妇女亲切的谈话，反映出列宁—伏尔加·顿运河的伟大工程建设者的高度劳动热情。
    这些节目均将于十月革命节前后在北京上演或广播。
