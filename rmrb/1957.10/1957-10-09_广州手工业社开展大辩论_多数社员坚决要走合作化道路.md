Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th - Over 40,000 members from more than 500 handicraft cooperatives in Guangzhou have launched a major debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism. After the debate, the vast majority of members have distinguished between right and wrong on major issues and expressed their firm support for the path of cooperativization.

Some members of the Zhongnan Hygiene Products Cooperative once said: Individual operators can do whatever they want, with endless possibilities, unlike cooperatives which have institutional regulations. The cooperative then organized a debate among its members on the topic of "What are the endless possibilities of individual operators?" During the debate, members You Guangyan and Tan Huiquan cited examples such as earning money by bleaching and processing flour sacks into cotton clothes and children's wear, and making good sales by purchasing bandages and mosquito net cloth to make masks when there was a shortage of masks on the market, illustrating that individual operators are flexible and have many advantages. Other members retorted that individual operators are deceiving customers by using old materials as good quality goods. This endless variety is irresponsible to consumers. Cooperatives are a socialist economy and cannot be like that. You Guangyan disagreed, saying, "You get what you pay for, what's wrong with that?" Other members further analyzed that purchasing bandages and mosquito net cloth in bulk is illegal and a speculative act. Some members used a large number of facts to expose the capitalist behaviors of individual operators, such as cutting corners and exploiting labor, which are not advantages at all. After the debate, the members all said: "So that's what the endless possibilities of individual operators are." Many members in the East District also realized through the debate on this issue that only taking the path of cooperativization is the only correct path. Old member Du Qiu said: "I have been a craftsman for decades, and I have never made a fortune. At the end of the month, I still have to worry about paying rent and taxes. Now, even if you beat me, I will not be an individual operator." Some members also summarized the seven major benefits of cooperatives, such as the promising future of cooperatives, the stable production and life of members, good learning conditions, and rapid improvement of technical skills, etc.

At present, the city-wide debate in handicraft cooperatives is unfolding in full swing, and some have begun to move towards in-depth discussions.

    广州手工业社开展大辩论
    多数社员坚决要走合作化道路
    新华社广州8日电　广州市已有五百多个手工业社的四万多名社员，展开了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论。绝大多数社员经过大辩论，分清了大是大非，表示坚决走合作化道路。
    中南卫生用品生产社有些社员曾经说：个体户想做什么就做什么，可以千变万化，不像合作社有制度规定。这个社就以“个体户的千变万化是怎样的”为题，组织社员辩论。社员游广炎、谭惠权在辩论时，举出把面粉袋漂染加工后制成棉衣、童装出售能赚钱，趁市场上口罩脱销时，购买绷带和蚊帐布制作口罩销路很好等等事例，说明个体户灵活，好处多。别的社员便反驳说：个体户这种做法是以旧料充好货欺骗顾客，这种千变万化是对消费者不负责任，合作社是社会主义经济，就不能是那样。游广炎不服，说“一分钱一分货，有什么不好？”其他社员便进一步分析，套购绷带、蚊帐布是违法的事情，是投机行为。有的社员用大量事实揭发了个体户偷工减料、雇工剥削的资本主义行为，根本不是什么优越性。经过辩论，社员们都说：“个体户的千变万化原来如此。”东区也有许多社员通过这个问题的辩论，认识到只有走合作化才是唯一正确的道路。老社员杜秋说：“我过去做了几十年手工业，没有发过财，到月尾还要担心交租交税，现在打我，我也不干个体户了。”有的社员还总结了合作社的七大好处，比如合作社前途远大，社员生产和生活稳定，学习条件好，技术水平提高的快等等。
    目前，全市手工业社的大辩论正在全面铺开，有的已开始转向深入。
