Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd: Guangdong Province's finance and trade departments have dispatched over 10,000 cadres to the countryside to listen to and accept criticisms made by farmers regarding finance and trade work during the "blooming and contending" period, thereby improving their work.

    Over the past month or so, many grassroots finance and trade units in Guangdong Province have improved their operations based on the opinions of farmers expressed during the "Great Blooming and Great Contending." Supply and marketing cooperatives and grain supply stations in many counties, such as Hepu, Dongguan, Shunde, Maoming, Hua County, and Yangchun, have extended or adjusted their business hours to facilitate farmers' purchases. Some counties have also changed the weekly rest system to non-market days to adapt to farmers' habits. The medical supply departments in Maoming County have also made provisions that if farmers need to buy medicine for urgent illnesses, they must be open even during non-business hours. The finance and trade departments of Xinhui County listened to the opinions of the masses and adopted methods such as local purchasing and local processing to reduce the circulation links of commodities, resulting in lower retail prices for more than 500 commodities. Sales units in various places have also held "Good Service Month" and "Good Service Competition" activities to improve the service attitude of salespersons.

    Many local finance and trade departments have accepted farmers' opinions and strengthened their leadership and management of free markets. Xinhui County recently established market exchanges in Duruen, Gujing and other districts, dealing in commodities that are not subject to state monopoly purchase and unified purchase, and restricting the speculative activities of certain farmer merchants and unlicensed vendors, so that the prices of these commodities tend to be stable. Not long ago, the commercial department of this county also helped farmers sell a batch of citrus fruits and bananas that had been blown down by typhoons, reducing the farmers' losses.

    When the "blooming and contending" campaign began in the rural areas, the leading finance and trade departments of Guangdong Province organized nine work groups with leading cadres from the provincial finance and trade system as the backbone to go to the countryside. Finance and trade departments of each special zone and county also specially organized work groups or sent special personnel directly to districts, townships, and cooperatives to listen to the opinions of farmers on finance and trade work and assist grassroots finance and trade departments in improving their work. Many counties, districts, and townships have also set up special personnel to be responsible for collecting, studying, and processing farmers' opinions. Recently, in order to further improve the work of the finance and trade system while rectifying it, the rectification offices of the local party committees and county committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Guangdong Province have also established special groups to be responsible for leading the finance and trade system to carry out improvement work in a step-by-step manner.

    This newspaper reports that the units of the finance and trade system in Anhui Province have actively implemented the spirit of "rectifying while improving" and have achieved remarkable results in improving their work.

    First, all departments have paid attention to improving their operations. The Provincial Grain Bureau, based on the opinions put forward at the Four-Level Cadre Conference and the situation it had grasped in the past, improved the method of unified purchase and sale of grain. The supply standard was changed to rationing per person. In the past, the grain supply standard in rural areas was the same for adults and children, so households with more children could not eat enough, and households with fewer children reported that they did not have enough to eat. Now, the method of rationing per person is implemented to achieve rational use of grain. In addition, the management method of grain coupons has been improved: non-agricultural households in cities and towns are issued supply certificates, and grain is purchased with certificates. If necessary, part of the circulating grain coupons can be exchanged for use. The method of combining tickets and certificates is fully implemented in rural areas and directly arranged to households, so that loopholes in the use of grain coupons are blocked. At the same time, the accounting year of the retention volume in rural areas has been changed to basically conform to the local grain production season.

    Some time ago, the commercial department once relaxed the operation and management of materials open to the free market, so that speculative price increases and purchases by private merchants and peddlers occurred continuously, and even formed a free flow in some areas. In response to this situation, in addition to deciding to strengthen the management of the free market, the commercial department strengthened the operation of materials open to the free market (ie, three types of materials), carried out appropriate turnover, to stabilize market prices. After the implementation of this decision, the prices of non-staple foods in various places have fallen. For example, before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the price of each catty of native chicken in the free market in Hefei was 52 to 54 cents, and after the Mid-Autumn Festival, due to strengthened market management and supply, it dropped to 33 to 40 cents per catty. The Commercial Department has also recently improved the calculation method of the purchase price of live pigs. In the past, the purchase of live pigs was calculated by removing the head, hooves, and internal organs and calculating the price per catty of meat. The areas along the Yangtze River reflected that this method did not conform to the habits of the masses. Now the price calculation method of catty of meat per catty remains unchanged, but for the purchase of live pigs in the areas along the Yangtze River, the price of the head and hooves is halved; in the areas bordering the Yangtze and Huai rivers, the price is calculated at a discount of 30%.

    The Provincial Bank has improved the management method of agricultural loan funds, and changed the original practice of the province's unified control of agricultural loan funds to the method of verifying the fixed agricultural loan funds of each county to promote the enthusiasm of each county to collect loans. After the implementation of this method, all counties attach great importance to the current loan collection work, and the control of loans is also tighter. The Provincial Bank has also clearly divided the internal division of labor for loans to overcome the phenomenon of buck-passing.

### 倾听和接受群众的批评和建议  广东安徽财贸部门大力改进工作

    倾听和接受群众的批评和建议
    广东安徽财贸部门大力改进工作
    新华社广州22日电　广东省财贸部门抽调一万多名干部，下乡倾听和接受农民在鸣放中对财贸工作提出的批评，改进了工作。
    最近一个多月来，广东省各地不少财贸基层单位已根据大鸣大放中农民的意见，改善了经营。合浦、东莞、顺德、茂名、化县、阳春等许多县的供销社、粮食供应站等销售单位，都延长或调整了营业时间，便利农民购买。有的县还把按周休息的办法改为非墟（赶集）日休息，以适应农民习惯。茂名县的医药供应部门并作了规定，凡农民因急病要买药时，非营业时间也要营业。新会县财贸部门听取群众意见，采取就地收购、就地加工，减少商品流转环节等办法，使五百多种商品零售价格降低。各地销售单位，还举行“服务良好月”、“服务良好竞赛”等，改善营业员的服务态度。
    许多地方的财贸部门接受农民意见，加强了对自由市场的领导和管理。新会县最近在杜阮、古井等区建立了市场交易所，经营那些不是国家统购和统一收购的商品，限制某些农民经商和无牌摊贩的投机活动，使这些商品的价格趋于稳定。这个县商业部门还在不久以前，替农民推销了一批被台风吹落的柑、香蕉等水果，减少农民的损失。
    广东省财贸领导部门在农村开始鸣放时，就组织了以省级财贸系统负责干部为骨干的九个工作组下乡，各专区及县的财贸部门也专门组织工作组或派出专人，直接下到区、乡、社听取农民对财贸工作的意见，协助基层财贸部门改进工作。不少县的区、乡还设了专人负责收集、研究和处理农民的意见。最近，为了进一步做好财贸系统的边整边改工作，广东省各地中共地委、县委整风办公室还设立专门小组，负责领导财贸系统有步骤地进行改进工作。
    本报讯　安徽省财贸系统各单位积极贯彻“边整边改”精神，在改进工作方面获得显著成绩。
    首先，各部门都注意改进了业务。省粮食厅根据四级干部会议所提出的意见及平常所掌握的情况，改进了粮食统购统销办法。把供应标准改为分人定量。过去农村粮食供应标准，大人小孩都是一样多，因而小孩多的户就吃不了，小孩少的户反映不够吃。现在实行分人定量的办法，做到合理用粮。另外改进了粮票管理方法：城镇非农户，一律发给供应证，凭证购粮，如有必要可以兑换部分流通粮票使用。农村全面实行票证结合办法，直接安排到户，这样堵塞了粮票使用中的漏洞。同时也改变了农村的留用量的计算年度，使其与当地粮食生产季节基本符合。
    前些时候，商业部门曾一度放松了对开放自由市场物资的经营与管理，以致私商小贩投机抬价抢购等现象不断发生，部分地区甚至形成自流。商业部门针对这一情况，除决定加强对自由市场的管理外，并加强对开放自由市场物资（即三类物资）的经营，进行适当吞吐，以稳定市场价格。这一决定贯彻后，各地副食品价格均有下降。如合肥市中秋节前自由市场毛鸡每斤价格是五角二分至五角四分，中秋节后由于加强了市场管理和供应，便降为每斤三角三分至四角。商业厅最近还改进了生猪收购价格的计算方法。过去生猪收购是采取去头蹄内脏按斤肉斤价来计算价格的，沿江地区反映这种办法不合群众习惯。现在斤肉斤价计价方法不变，但对沿江地区生猪的收购，头蹄改为折半计算价格；江淮接壤地区三折一计算价格。
    省银行改进了农贷资金管理办法，把原来农贷资金由省统一掌握的做法改为核定各县固定农贷资金的办法，以促进各县收贷的积极性。这种办法实行后，各县都很重视当前的收贷工作，对放贷也控制较紧。省银行内部对贷款分工也进行了明确的划分，克服了扯皮现象。
