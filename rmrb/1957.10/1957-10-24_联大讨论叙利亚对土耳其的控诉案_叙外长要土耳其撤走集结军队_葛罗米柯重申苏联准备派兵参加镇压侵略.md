Xinhua News Agency, New York, 23rd dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd to discuss Syria's complaint regarding the threat to Syria's security and peace caused by Turkey's war preparations on its border.

Before the discussion began, Turkish representative Esin, under the blatant instigation of the US delegation, conspired to sabotage the discussion of Syria's complaint. He requested a postponement of the discussion of Syria's complaint and suggested that Saudi Arabia mediate between Syria and Turkey. However, this request was opposed by representatives from Syria, the Soviet Union, and other countries. Syrian representative Zeineddine said that there was actually no mediation, only a conspiracy to confuse the public and sabotage the UN General Assembly's discussion of Syria's complaint, in order to conceal the current situation. Soviet representative Gromyko emphasized that the issue raised by Syria was extremely important and of an urgent nature. This issue not only concerned the fate of the Near East but also the fate of the entire world, and the United Nations should condemn those who planned the aggression against Syria. The Soviet delegation firmly opposed postponing the discussion of Syria's complaint and firmly demanded an immediate discussion.

Since no formal proposal was made to postpone the discussion, the General Assembly did not vote on Turkey's request and began to discuss Syria's complaint.

Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar first made a lengthy speech, exposing the aggressive policies of the United States and its allies in the Near East. He said that Turkey's military actions in the Syrian border area could not be considered normal defense deployments to ensure domestic security. Turkey's actions were provocative actions against Syria, aimed at starting the war machine at an opportune moment. The deployment of the US Sixth Fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean was enough to show that Turkey's conspiracy was related to foreign countries.

He said that the main characteristics of the West's policy in the Middle East were: First, whenever Arab national movements no longer served the purposes of Western countries, they opposed them. Second, maintaining military and economic control by colonizing Middle Eastern countries. Third, dividing Arab countries. Fourth, establishing regimes willing to support these policies. Fifth, dragging Arab countries to serve Western purposes.

Bitar said that the West opposed the Syrian government because it was independent and had the strength to resist Western policies. Bitar demanded that Turkey withdraw the large number of troops assembled on the Syrian border. He said that the General Assembly should appoint a committee to verify the facts regarding the Turkish troops near the border and request that a report be submitted within ten days.

Egyptian representative Fawzi said that since Syria had requested a debate in the General Assembly, the General Assembly had an obligation to conduct the debate without delay. He said that the assurances made by the United States and Turkey that they did not intend to attack Syria were far from sufficient.

Soviet representative Gromyko said that the United Nations must not be deceived into thinking that the threat of an attack on Syria did not exist. The United Nations should not allow itself to be deceived. The danger of the situation should be explained to the people of all countries.

The Soviet Foreign Minister said that the so-called "Eisenhower-Dulles Doctrine" was based on the theory of a "vacuum," which has now been discredited. He said that the United States is now using economic blockade, political pressure, subversion, and other methods to deal with Syria, attempting to drag it into a Western alliance.

Gromyko said: Some people describe the Soviet Union's statement to Turkey as a threat. This is not a threat, it is a warning. It is the Soviet Union's responsibility to make the Turkish government aware of the dangers involved, and the Soviet government has a responsibility to help maintain peace in the Middle East.

Gromyko demanded that the United Nations General Assembly pass a resolution to ensure that Syria would be defended immediately in the event of an attack. He mentioned a Soviet proposal: all member states should guarantee to assist Syria in the event of aggression. He said: The Soviet government announces that the Soviet Union is ready to use its armed forces to participate in suppressing aggression and sanctioning those who disrupt peace.

He said that the United Nations should at least send a committee so that the United Nations can obtain direct, on-the-spot information about the true situation on the Syrian-Turkish border.

The Czechoslovak representative supported the speeches of the Syrian and Soviet representatives.

Turkish representative Esin tried his best to defend Turkey's aggressive conspiracy and stubbornly described the Soviet Union's actions to maintain peace in the Middle East as "interference" in Turkey's internal affairs.

US representative Lodge also tried his best to deny the accusations of Syria and the Soviet Union. In order to sabotage the discussions of the General Assembly, Lodge proposed that the General Assembly take action only after Saudi Arabia had mediated between Turkey and Syria. Lodge also instructed the Paraguayan representative to formally propose a motion recommending that the General Assembly adjourn indefinitely while Saudi Arabia conducts mediation.

The Syrian and Soviet representatives opposed the Paraguayan proposal, pointing out once again that this was an attempt by Western countries to bury Syria's complaint. The Syrian representative suggested that the General Assembly adjourn only until the 23rd. However, this suggestion was opposed by some countries. The Syrian representative suggested that the General Assembly adjourn only for three days, and this suggestion was passed with thirty-seven votes in favor, ten votes against, and thirty-four abstentions.

    联大讨论叙利亚对土耳其的控诉案
    叙外长要土耳其撤走集结军队
    葛罗米柯重申苏联准备派兵参加镇压侵略
    据新华社23日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会22日下午举行全体会议，讨论叙利亚就土耳其在它的边境的备战行动而引起的对叙利亚的安全和和平的威胁的控诉案。
    在讨论开始以前，土耳其代表艾辛在美国代表团公然怂恿下阴谋破坏对叙利亚控诉案的讨论。他要求延期讨论叙利亚的控诉案，建议让沙特阿拉伯在叙利亚和土耳其两国之间进行仲裁。但是这个要求遭到叙利亚和苏联等国代表的反对。叙利亚代表宰尼丁说，实际上没有任何仲裁，有的只是一种阴谋，想混淆视听，破坏联合国大会对叙利亚控诉案的讨论，以便掩饰目前的局势。苏联代表葛罗米柯强调指出，叙利亚提出的问题是极其重要的，并且具有刻不容缓的性质。这个问题不仅涉及中近东的命运，而且同全世界的命运息息相关，联合国应当谴责那些策划侵略叙利亚的肇事者。苏联代表团坚决反对延期讨论叙利亚的控诉案，坚决要求立即进行讨论。
    由于没有人提出要求延期讨论的正式提案，因此大会对土耳其的请求没有进行表决，并且开始对叙利亚的控诉案进行讨论。
    叙利亚外交部长比塔尔首先作了长篇发言，揭露了美国及其同盟者在近东的侵略政策。他说，土耳其在叙利亚边境一带的军事行动不能被认为是保障国内安全的正常的防御部署。土耳其的行动是对叙利亚的挑衅行动，目的是要在适当时机开动战争机器。美国第六舰队在东地中海的部署足以说明土耳其的阴谋是同外国有关的。
    他说，西方在中东的政策的主要特点是：一、不论在什么时候，只要阿拉伯民族运动不再为西方国家的目的服务，它们就反对阿拉伯民族运动。二、通过把中东国家殖民地化的办法来保持在军事上和经济上的控制。三、分裂阿拉伯国家。四、建立愿意支持这些政策的政权。五、把阿拉伯国家拖去为西方的目的服务。
    比塔尔说，西方所以反对叙利亚政府，是由于它是独立的，是有力量抵抗西方的政策的。　比塔尔要求土耳其撤走集结在叙利亚边境上的大量军队。他说，大会应该任命一个委员会来证实有关边境附近的土耳其军队的事实，并且要求在十天之内，提出报告。
    埃及代表法齐说，由于叙利亚要求大会辩论，大会有义务毫不拖延地进行辩论。他说，美国和土耳其提出的关于并不打算进攻叙利亚的保证是非常不够的。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯说，联合国决不能被蒙骗而认为攻击叙利亚的威胁并不存在。联合国不应容许自己受欺骗。应当向世界各国人民说明局势的危险性。
    苏联外交部长说，所谓的“艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯主义”是以“真空”的理论为基础的，这种理论现在已经名誉扫地。他说，美国现在正利用经济封锁、政治压力、颠复和其他手法对付叙利亚，企图把它拉入西方联盟。
    葛罗米柯说：某些人把苏联对土耳其提出的声明说成是威胁。这并不是威胁，这是警告。促使土耳其政府重视所牵涉的危险是苏联的责任，苏联政府有责任协助维持中东和平。
    葛罗米柯要求联合国大会通过决议保证在叙利亚遭到进攻时立即保卫它。他提到了苏联的一项建议：所有成员国家都应该保证在叙利亚遭受侵略时援助它。他说：苏联政府方面宣布，苏联准备使用它的武装部队参加镇压侵略和制裁破坏和平的人。
    他说，联合国起码应该派遣一个委员会以便使联合国能够得到关于叙利亚—土耳其边境的真实情况的直接的现场情况。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表支持叙利亚和苏联代表的发言。
    土耳其代表艾辛竭力为土耳其的侵略阴谋辩护，并且硬把苏联维护中东和平的行动说成是对土耳其内政的“干涉”。
    美国代表洛奇也竭力企图抵赖叙利亚和苏联的指责。为了破坏大会的讨论，洛奇主张大会在让沙特阿拉伯在土耳其和叙利亚之间进行调解后才采取行动。洛奇同时还指使巴拉圭代表正式提出一项提案，建议大会在沙特阿拉伯进行调解时无限期休会。
    叙利亚和苏联代表反对巴拉圭的提案，再次指出这是西方国家阴谋葬送叙利亚控诉案的企图。叙利亚代表建议大会只休会到23日为止。但是由于这个建议遭到一些国家的反对。叙利亚代表建议大会只休会三天，这个建议以三十七票赞成、十票反对、三十四票弃权而获得通过。
