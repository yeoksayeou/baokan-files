Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: The first group of thirty-three factories in Shanghai undergoing rectification formed two high tides in September: one of airing views and the other of production. Thirty-one factories completed or overfulfilled their production plans for the month.

After the start of the rectification movement, the workers put forward the slogan "Produce well during work hours, freely speak out after work." The walls outside the workshops and the corridors of these factories were plastered with big-character posters helping the Communist Party with rectification; inside the workshops, workers concentrated on production. The Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant constantly reported good news of achieving 100% qualification rates for all products made by entire shifts, producing 1,900 tons more steel than planned for the entire month. The Shanghai Boiler Factory completed its heaviest production task since the beginning of the year two days ahead of schedule in September, producing an additional seven boilers.

The Shanghai Ship Repair Yard, which started rectification earlier, had eight ships including "Xinqing" and "People No. 6" repaired and launched ahead of schedule this month, overfulfilling the monthly plan. The Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory overproduced a total of eighty winches and crushers in September.

The Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill, where Chairman Mao had recently visited to see the big-character posters, saw its leadership accept workers' opinions and improve more than 500 aspects of its work within a month. All production targets for the factory were overfulfilled this month.

The six state-owned textile factories and one printing and dyeing factory in the first batch of rectification also completed their September plans excellently. The cotton yarn produced by factories such as the No. 2 and No. 6 Cotton Mills was 100% up to standard.

Among the light industrial factories, the Dafu Rubber Factory had its best production month since the beginning of the year in September. The rate of substandard rubber shoes decreased from six-tenths to two-tenths of the total, and the factory overproduced nearly 20,000 pairs of rain boots for the entire month.

The Tongchang Vehicle Manufacturing Factory, which had been jointly operated for just over a year, implemented eight measures to improve product quality in September while preparing for rectification. The factory produced more than 6,000 vehicle frames for the entire month, more than double the output of August.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th: The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has been vigorously improving its work in the rectification movement. Most of the more than 60,000 opinions raised by employees have been resolved.

Factory Director Rao Bin personally wrote letters in response to the nineteen opinions transferred to him from various workshops, and made self-criticisms regarding certain shortcomings. In the "Humbly Listen to Mass Criticism, Resolutely Change Work Style, Improve Work" bulletin board column set up in each workshop, big-character posters of leading cadres accepting criticism and improving their work attracted more and more workers. Many leading cadres in the tool department system were still studying and processing the opinions raised by workers at midnight, preparing to announce them the next day. Many foremen, workshop directors, and party and league cadres were also visiting workers, investigating situations, and improving their work during holidays.

When handling mass opinions, the functional departments and workshop divisions all formulated specific and practical plans to improve their work, announced them to the workers, and solicited their opinions. Because they relied on the masses, were responsible at each level, and mobilized at all levels, many problems were solved quickly. The Tool No. 2 Workshop processed more than 800 opinions in seven days. The workers said that our opinions matter, and we will offer more opinions in the future. Due to the leadership's active and rapid improvement of work, the labor enthusiasm of workers in various workshops has generally increased. In September, the month with the most intense production tasks, the entire factory completed its production plan five days ahead of schedule.

    “上班时好好生产，下班后大鸣大放”
    上海首批整风工厂完成上月生产计划
    第一汽车厂九月份计划提前完成
    新华社上海6日电　上海第一批整风的三十三个工厂在9月份形成了鸣放和生产的两个高潮，有三十一个厂都完成或超额完成了这个月的生产计划。
    职工们在整风开始以后提出了“上班时好好生产，下班后大鸣大放”的口号。这些厂的车间外面墙壁上、通道上，到处贴满了帮助共产党整风的大字报；车间里，职工们精神贯注地进行生产。上海第二钢厂不断传出创造全班产品合格率达到100％的捷报，全月比计划多生产了一千九百吨钢材。上海锅炉厂提前两天完成了今年以来最繁重的9月份的生产任务，额外多生产了七台锅炉。
    开展整风较早的上海船舶修造厂，这个月里有“新庆”、“人民六号”等八艘轮船先后提前修复下水，全月计划超额完成。上海矿山机器厂9月份超额生产的卷扬机和破碎机等共有八十台。
    不久以前，毛主席前去看过大字报的上海国棉一厂，领导上在一个月内接受职工意见改进了五百多项工作，这月全厂的各项生产指标都超额完成。
    第一批整风的六个国营纺织厂和一个印染厂，9月份计划完成得也很出色。国棉二厂、六厂等厂生产的棉纱百分之百是标准品。
    轻工业厂中的大孚橡胶厂，9月份的生产成绩是今年以来最好的一月，生产胶鞋的副次品从原来的十分之六下降到十分之二，全月超额生产了近两万双雨鞋。
    新合营一年多的同昌车行制造厂，9月份在准备整风的同时，贯彻了八项提高产品质量的措施，全月出产了六千多只车架，比8月份的产量增加一倍以上。
    新华社长春7日电　第一汽车制造厂在整风中雷厉风行改进工作，职工提出的六万多条意见，已大部获得解决。
    厂长饶斌收到由各车间转给他的十九条意见，他都一一地亲笔写信答复，并针对某些缺点作了自我批评。在各车间普遍设立的“虚心倾听群众批评，坚决转变作风、改进工作”的板报专栏里，领导干部接受批评、改进工作的大字报，吸引着愈来愈多的工人群众。工具处系统的许多车间领导干部，午夜还在研究处理工人提出的意见，准备第二天公布。还有很多工长、工部主任、党团负责干部，假日也在访问工人，调查情况，改进工作。
    各职能处、车间工部，在处理群众意见的时候，都订出具体、切实的改进工作的计划，向工人公布，征求工人意见。由于依靠群众、逐级负责、层层动手，许多问题解决得很快。工具二车间在七天内，就处理了八百多条意见。工人说，我们提的意见管事，今后还要多提意见。由于领导上积极、迅速的改进工作，各车间工人的劳动热情普遍高涨，在生产任务最紧张的9月里，全厂提前五天完成了这个月的生产计划。
