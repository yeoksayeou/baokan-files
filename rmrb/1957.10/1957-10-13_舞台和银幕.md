　　Hunan Shadow Puppet Art Troupe Performs Shadow Puppetry in Beijing

　　The Hunan Shadow Puppet Art Troupe, having returned from performance tours in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, France, Yugoslavia, Mongolia, and Switzerland, is now presenting its shadow puppet art, which was warmly received by foreign audiences, to audiences in the capital.

　　Shadow puppetry has a history of over a thousand years in China and is widely popular among the people. After liberation, thanks to the Party's attention and cultivation, this art form has flourished. In recent years, the Hunan Shadow Puppet Art Troupe has reorganized and reformed some traditional plays, and also created some new ones, such as the fairy tales and fables "Two Friends," "Tortoise and Crane," and "Greedy Monkey," which are being performed this time. There have also been many improvements in performance techniques. In the past, one actor manipulated more than a dozen shadow puppets while also managing the music and singing; now, sometimes two or three actors manipulate one shadow puppet, which makes the puppet's movements both delicate and lifelike. The size of the shadow puppets has also been enlarged, and the mouth and eyes can move freely; a dedicated band has also been established to provide accompaniment. (Chen Maizhong)

　　Large-Scale Color Stage Documentary in Production

　　This autumn, art troupes from the Soviet Union, Hungary, Yugoslavia, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Mongolia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Colombia, Mexico, Egypt, and the United Kingdom have come to our country one after another, blossoming into exotic and colorful flowers. Many Chinese audiences have already been fortunate enough to feast their eyes on them. In order to enable more people to further understand and appreciate the artistic essence of these countries, the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio is filming their superb performances into a large-scale color stage documentary called "Foreign Art Troupes in China." The film will be completed by the end of the year and will be available to audiences in the new year.

　　These days, they are giving internal viewing performances for the literary and art circles, and have already received much praise. In particular, the major play "Master Qiao Eats Crispy Cakes" (Tanxi, originally named Huangjieyi, also known as Butterfly Matchmaker), the audience was repeatedly amused and appreciative of the humorous, interesting and thought-provoking story and lines.

    湖南皮影木偶艺术剧团在京演出皮影戏
    由苏、捷、波、匈、法、南、蒙、瑞士访问演出归国的湖南省皮影木偶艺术剧团，现在正以它深受国外观众欢迎的皮影艺术与首都观众见面。
    皮影戏在我国有着一千多年的历史，广泛地流传于民间。解放后由于党的重视和培养，使这朵花放出了光彩。湖南省皮影木偶剧团几年来整理和改革了一些传统剧目，同时也创作了一些新的剧目：如这次演出的“两朋友”、“龟与鹤”、“贪心的猴子”等童话、寓言故事。在表演技术上，也有了不少改进。过去一个演员操纵十多个皮影人，同时又兼管音乐和唱白；现在有时由两三个演员操纵一个皮影人，这就使皮影人的动作既细致又逼真；皮影人的尺寸也放大了，口、眼都可以活动自如；还成立了专门的乐队作伴奏。　　（陈迈众）（附图片）
