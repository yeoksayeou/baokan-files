Traditional Chinese Medicine Significantly Effective in Treating Lymph Node Tuberculosis

Physician Tang Rongzhou Has Cured Over Two Hundred Patients

(Our newspaper's report) Physician Tang Rongzhou of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Surgery Department of the Wuhan Medical College Affiliated Hospital, since January 1955, has treated over six hundred cases of lymph node tuberculosis based on the treatment principles of traditional Chinese medicine, achieving remarkable results.

Physician Tang Rongzhou, based on the treatment principles of the Inner Canon's approach to scrofula related to cold and heat, adopts a combined internal and external treatment, a comprehensive holistic therapy, differentiating the condition, prescribing internally medicines such as "Hua Ju Wan" (Ulcer Resolving Pill) and "Yi Qi Yang Rong Hua He Wan" (Qi Boosting and Nourishing Rong Lymph Node Resolving Pill) to open the pores, promote coagulation, replenish qi, activate blood circulation, and eliminate toxins from the accumulation of cold phlegm; externally applying medicines such as "Hui Yang Gao" (Yang Returning Paste) and "Chong He Gao" (Neutralizing Paste) to warm accumulated cold and chronic frigidity, dispel hardness, and eliminate dampness; promote qi circulation, activate blood circulation, resolve toxins, generate flesh, and regulate metabolism; in addition, he also employs musk-male medicinal thread moxibustion. All three methods are used in combination for each case. After more than two years of statistics, out of over six hundred cases, two hundred and forty cases were cured; three hundred and forty-five cases showed significant improvement; forty cases were ineffective; and twenty-five cases worsened. Among the two hundred and forty cured cases, the general treatment course was within six months for two hundred and eighteen cases; within one year for twenty-two cases.

According to Physician Tang Rongzhou's experience in the clinical process, after the ulcers that have been cured are closed, the scars are not very obvious, and those with weakness symptoms can also be cured along the way. Because it is entirely using traditional Chinese medicine, the medicine prices are low, which can greatly reduce the burden on patients.

    唐榕洲医师依据内经寒热瘰疬治疗法则，采取内外兼治，整体综合疗法，辨别病情，内服化疽丸、益气养荣化核丸等药，以开腠理、能凝结、补气活血、消除寒痰凝结之毒；外贴回阳膏、冲和膏等药，温其积寒痼冷，消坚散湿；行气活血，化毒生肌，调整新陈代谢；此外，并施以麝雄药线灸疗。对每一病例都是三者并用。经过两年多的统计，在六百多例中痊愈的有二百四十例；显著进步的有三百四十五例；无效的四十例；恶化的二十五例。治愈的二百四十例的一般疗程，在六个月以内治愈的有二百一十八例；一年以内治愈的有二十二例。
