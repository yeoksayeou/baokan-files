Analyze the Situation, Improve Work, Train the Ranks
Mancheng Xingyang Post Office Prepares to Welcome the Great Debate
(Our Newspaper News) Reporter Wang Jinfeng reports: On how to shift from the great blooming and contending to debate in the rural socialist education movement, the pilot work team dispatched by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to Xingyang Post Office Township in Mancheng County, with the assistance of the local township party committee, has initially explored some experiences.

Around October 1st, this township began to shift to the preparation work for the great debate. By September, most villages had begun key debates. Facts have proved that it is essential to fully prepare the following work for carrying out the great socialist debate.

First, it is a very important task before the debate to seriously analyze and study the problems and opinions raised during the blooming and contending. This not only allows the leadership to distinguish right from wrong, so as to study and improve in a timely manner, but more importantly, to analyze who raised these opinions, what their motives and purposes are, and whether they are ideological problems or political problems. As of now, the township has received a total of 5,817 opinions. Among them, 1,759 relate to the work style of cadres, accounting for 30.2%; 1,428 relate to the operation and management of cooperatives, accounting for 24.6%; 2,458 relate to grain and the relationship between workers and peasants, accounting for 42.2%; and 172 are others. Judging from the nature of these opinions, the vast majority are correct and well-intentioned criticisms and suggestions. For example, out of the 755 opinions raised in Dasai Village, 685 were correct and reasonable, accounting for more than 90%. On the basis of classification and ranking, each village convened branch committees and cooperative committees for discussion and research: for well-intentioned and correct opinions, those that could be improved were quickly improved, and those that could not be improved immediately were planned and explained to the masses; misunderstandings were clarified through appropriate forums; and erroneous and reactionary remarks were analyzed and studied, which provided favorable conditions for transitioning to the debate.

Secondly, while analyzing, studying, classifying and ranking, it is necessary to make the greatest determination to resolutely correct mistakes and solve problems for correct and reasonable opinions. This is not only necessary for improving leadership and enhancing work, but also encourages the enthusiasm of the masses and inspires their initiative to participate in the great debate. According to statistics, the township has already improved 217 items related to the problems raised during the blooming and contending (one item includes several opinions), and 42 items have been decided to be improved soon. These include the clearing and publicizing of the financial accounts of cooperatives and teams; the solution of the problems of village and cooperative cadres over-recording work points and participating in labor; the improvement of livestock use and feeding; the adjustment of members' private plots; the examination and correction of cadres' ideological work styles, and the improvement of production management issues, etc.

Thirdly, adjust and expand the backbone team, cultivate and train backbone elements, and train a basic combat force for the great debate. After the test of the blooming and contending, some of the originally organized backbone teams were passive and backward, and some had serious dissatisfaction and lost their backbone role. Therefore, based on the situation exposed during the blooming and contending, the original activists were re-examined, and new activists (mainly poor and lower-middle peasants) discovered in the movement were also absorbed to expand the backbone team. The training and cultivation of backbones mainly involves improving their class consciousness through class education, further enabling them to understand the nature and purpose of the movement, and explaining that the debate is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and it is a question of who triumphs over whom. Each village separately convened youth forums, forums of poor and lower-middle peasants, and forums on diligence and thrift in managing households, and carried out class education through methods of recalling and comparing, calculating detailed accounts, and presenting facts to pour out grievances. For example, at a forum of 23 poor and hired peasant households in Xixinzhang, they recalled that when they worked individually, they had no livestock, no carts, and no wells, and they could not farm well even if they were exhausted. Now that they have joined the cooperative, the past difficulties have been solved. Poor peasant Wang Laoai said: "In the past, when we worked individually, none of us poor people could eat enough after a year of hard work. Now we all have food and clothing. It is unconscionable to say that there is not enough food. Look, aren't everyone's faces radiant?" In particular, young activists have not experienced the suffering of the old society and are very enthusiastic, but they cannot withstand the erosion of reactionary remarks. Therefore, each village focused on educating young people, convening youth forums, having elderly peasants introduce past situations, and mobilizing young people to visit peasants who had begged for food and carried out long-term labor, which had extremely profound educational significance for them. Xiaosai Village experienced that it is more effective to let young people talk to their elders. When League member Lu Zhili heard others introduce the past suffering, he smiled and seemed disbelieving. After returning home, he asked his grandmother how things used to be. His grandmother said: "When I first came to your house, I borrowed a quilt from others. During the famine years, we couldn't eat grain for several days. In a bumper year, each person only had five or six ounces a day. We couldn't eat dumplings every other year." As she spoke, she cried. Lu Zhili was very moved and felt that only by refuting anti-socialist remarks could socialism be consolidated and his own happiness preserved. The next day, he found Wang Laoguo, who was shouting that there was not enough food, and said, "Let's compete tonight," and wanted to reason with Wang Qingxiang, a wealthy middle peasant who opposed cooperativization and said that the present was not as good as the past.

　　分析情况　改进工作　训练队伍
    满城陉阳驿做好准备迎接大辩论
    本报讯　记者王金凤报道：农村社会主义教育运动在大鸣大放的基础上如何转入辩论，中共河北省委派驻满城县陉阳驿乡的试点工作组在当地乡党委的协助下，初步摸索出了一些经验。
    这个乡在10月1日前后，开始转向大辩论的准备工作。至9月为止，大部分村都已开始重点辩论。事实证明，充分做好以下的准备工作，对于开展社会主义大辩论是十分必要的。
    第一，认真分析研究鸣放出的问题和意见，这是辩论前一项很重要的工作。这样不仅在领导上分清是非，以便及时研究改进，更重要的是分析这些意见是什么人提的，他的动机和目的是什么，是思想问题还是政治问题。截至目前为止，全乡共鸣放出意见五千八百十七条。其中属于干部思想作风的一千七百五十九条，占30.2％；属于合作社经营管理方面的一千四百二十八条，占24.6％；属于粮食、工农关系方面的二千四百五十八条，占42.2％；其他一百七十二条。从性质上看，绝大部分都是正确的、善意的批评和建议，如大赛村在鸣放出的七百五十五条意见中，正确合理的有六百八十五条，占90％以上。在分类排队的基础上，各村召集了支委会、社委会进行了讨论研究：对善意的正确的意见，能改进的就迅速改了一批，不能立即改进的定出计划，向群众作了交代；对误解的通过适当场合作了解释；对错误的和反动的言行进行了分析研究，这就对转入辩论提供了有利条件。
    其次，在分析研究，分类排队的同时，对于正确合理意见，要下最大决心狠狠地改正错误，解决问题。这不仅对改进领导，提高工作是需要的，而且鼓舞了群众情绪，启发了群众参加大辩论的积极性。据统计，全乡对鸣放出的问题已经改进了的有二百一十七项（一项包括几条意见），作出决定即将改正的四十二项。其中有社、队财务账目的清理公布；村、社干部多记工分、参加劳动的问题的解决；牲畜使用、饲养的改进；社员自留地的调整；干部思想作风的检查改正以及生产管理问题的改进等等。
    第三，调整与扩大骨干队伍，培养训练骨干分子，为大辩论训练好战斗的基本队伍。经过鸣放考验，原组织的骨干队伍，有的消极落后，有的有严重不满情绪而失去骨干作用。因此根据鸣放中暴露的情况，重新审查原有的积极分子，对运动中发现的新的积极分子（主要是贫雇农、下中农）也吸收进来，扩大了骨干队伍。对于骨干的训练培养，主要是通过阶级教育，提高其阶级觉悟，进一步使他们了解运动的性质和目的，说明辩论就是社会主义与资本主义两条道路的斗争，是谁战胜谁的问题。各村都分别召开了青年座谈会，贫雇农、下中农座谈会以及勤俭持家座谈会，在会上通过回忆对比、算细账、摆事实的办法，进行翻心诉苦的阶级教育。如西辛章二十三户贫雇农座谈时，回忆起单干时没牲口、没车、没有水井，累死也种不好地，如今入了社，过去的困难都解决了。贫农王老爱说：“过去单干时我们这些人劳苦一年谁家也不够吃，现在都有吃有穿，有人说粮食不够吃是没有良心的。你看谁的面色不是红光满面呢？”特别是青年积极分子，他们没有经历过旧社会的苦难日子，积极性很高，但经不住反动言论的侵袭。因此各村都突出地抓住了对青年的教育，召开青年座谈会，由老年农民介绍过去情况；发动青年访问要过饭、扛过长活的农民，对他们有极其深刻的教育意义。小赛村体验出，让青年人和自己的老人谈收效更大。团员路智立在听到别人介绍过去苦难经历时光笑，有不相信的样子，回家后又问他奶奶过去光景如何。他奶奶说：“我刚到咱家，借人家被盖，过荒年几天也吃不上粮食，丰收年每人每天也不过五、六两，三年两头吃不上饺子。”说着都哭了。路智立听了很感动，觉着只有辩倒反社会主义的言论，才能巩固社会主义，保住自己幸福。第二天他就找叫喊粮食不够吃的王老国说，今晚咱俩较量较量，并要找反对合作化、说现在不如过去好的富裕中农王庆祥说理。
