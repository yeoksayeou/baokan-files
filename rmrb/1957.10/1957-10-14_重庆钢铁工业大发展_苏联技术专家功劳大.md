Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th - Chongqing's iron and steel industry has developed rapidly with the comprehensive assistance of Soviet experts.

From the time of the resumption of production after liberation, Soviet experts in all aspects of ferrous metallurgy, including steelmaking, ironmaking, steel rolling, mechanical equipment, and capital construction, have come to Chongqing every year to help the steel plants with equipment upgrades and the transmission of technical experience.

Chongqing's iron and steel industry had a very weak foundation, outdated equipment, and low production levels. In 1949, the city's steel production was less than 10,000 tons. After the Soviet experts came to Chongqing, they believed that although the equipment in these factories was very old, the potential was great, and the production capacity could be greatly improved after renovation. From 1950 to the present, Soviet experts have successively guided the renovation of all major equipment in various factories, including ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling. The production capacity of the city's open-hearth furnaces alone has increased six or seven times after renovation and expansion.

In the early days of liberation, it took more than ten hours to make a furnace of steel, and many products produced more waste than finished products. For example, in 1950, the qualified rate of electric furnace steel production in the city was only 30%; before 1954, the qualified rate of steel plates produced by Chongqing Iron and Steel Company was less than half. After the Soviet experts came to Chongqing, they patiently helped the steel plants solve a series of key problems over a long period of time. After implementing the experts' various suggestions on improving quality, the quality of the city's major iron and steel products gradually increased, and now the qualified rate generally reaches 98% to 99%. In terms of steelmaking, due to the learning of various Soviet production methods for strengthening the smelting process, smelting time has generally been shortened by about half while the output per furnace has increased by 50% to more than 100%.

Due to equipment upgrades and improved technical levels, last year the city's steel production exceeded 1950 by more than thirty times. In the past, steel plants could only produce more than a dozen types of ordinary carbon steel. After expert guidance and learning from Soviet technical data, the variety of steel has now increased to more than two hundred types. Other important products such as steel plates, heavy steel rails, and railway tie plates were also produced under the guidance of Soviet experts.

### 重庆钢铁工业大发展  苏联技术专家功劳大

　　重庆钢铁工业大发展  苏联技术专家功劳大
    据新华社重庆12日电　重庆钢铁工业在苏联专家全面帮助下得到迅速发展。
    从解放后恢复生产的时候开始，苏联有关黑色冶金方面的炼钢、炼铁、轧钢、机械设备、基本建设等各个方面的专家就年年来到重庆，帮助各钢铁厂进行设备改造和传授技术经验。
    重庆市钢铁工业基础很薄弱，设备陈旧，生产水平低，1949年全市钢的产量还不到一万吨。苏联专家来到重庆后，认为这些工厂的设备虽然很旧，但是潜力很大，经过改造以后，可以大大提高生产能力。从1950年到现在，苏联专家先后指导各个工厂改造了炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等全部主要设备。单是全市的平炉经过改建扩建以后，生产能力就比原来扩大了六、七倍。
    解放初期，炼一炉钢要十几小时，许多产品生产出来的废品比成品还要多。如1950年全市电炉钢的生产，合格品只有30％；1954年以前重庆钢铁公司生产的钢板，合格品不到一半。苏联专家来到重庆以后，长期、耐心地帮助各钢铁厂解决了一系列的关键问题。在执行专家有关提高质量的各种建议以后，全市主要钢铁产品的质量就逐步上升，现在合格品率一般都达到了98％到99％。炼钢方面由于学习了苏联强化冶炼过程的各种生产方法，在炉产量扩大了50％到一倍多的情况下，冶炼时间一般还缩短了一半左右。
    由于设备改造和技术水平的提高，去年全市钢的产量已经超过1950年三十多倍。过去各钢铁厂只能生产十多种普通炭素钢，经过专家指导和学习苏联技术资料以后，现在钢的品种已增加到二百多种。其他像钢板、重型钢轨、铁路垫板等重要产品，也是在苏联专家指导下生产出来的。
