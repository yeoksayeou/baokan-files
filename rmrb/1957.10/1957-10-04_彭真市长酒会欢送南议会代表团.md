Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen hosted a reception this evening to bid farewell to the Yugoslav Federal People's Assembly Delegation led by President Stanboulic. Yugoslav Ambassador to China Popovic was also invited to the reception.

Mayor Peng Zhen said in his speech at the reception: The common goals, common interests, and common belief in Marxism-Leninism closely link the peoples of China and Yugoslavia. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have been continuously developed. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the achievements made by the fraternal Yugoslav people in socialist construction.

Mayor Peng Zhen praised Yugoslavia's efforts to promote peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between countries with different social systems, and pointed out that the unity between Yugoslavia and socialist countries has been further strengthened recently. He said that unity is strength, and the stronger the unity of our socialist countries, the more conducive it will be to our common cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace. The Chinese people are willing to continue to work with the Yugoslav people and the people of all socialist countries to further strengthen the unity of socialist countries. Peng Zhen thanked the delegation for bringing the profound friendship of the Yugoslav people and asked the delegation to convey the friendship and respect of the people of Beijing and the entire Chinese people to the Yugoslav people.

President Stanboulic, in his speech, thanked the Chinese comrades for their cordial reception, comradely welcome, and friendly care, and talked about his impressions of the delegation's visit to China. He said that everywhere they went, they saw people's selfless spirit of labor, who overcame many difficulties in construction and achieved great achievements. What they saw and heard made them feel happy and firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have no insurmountable difficulties.

President Stanboulic pointed out that in order to effectively build socialism, peaceful, equal, and democratic cooperation among all nations and countries in the world is necessary. Under conditions of sustained peace, the forces of democracy and socialism will develop and grow more effectively. He said that we can be satisfied to point out that their comprehensive cooperation including the national, party, social, economic, and cultural, is now increasingly achieving greater and more concrete results. More such achievements should be made.
