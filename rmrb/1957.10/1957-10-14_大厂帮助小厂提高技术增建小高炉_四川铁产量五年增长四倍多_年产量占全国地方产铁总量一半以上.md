Large Factories Help Small Factories Improve Technology and Build More Small Blast Furnaces
Sichuan's Iron Production Increases More Than Fourfold in Five Years
Annual Output Accounts for More Than Half of the National Local Iron Production

(Our reporter Li Ce reports) Sichuan Province's local iron and steel industry's iron production increased more than fourfold during the First Five-Year Plan period. In June of this year, the province's local iron and steel industry completed the production plan stipulated by the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, with the annual output reaching more than half of the total national local iron production. About 60% of the iron was supplied to state-owned steel plants and state-owned machinery factories.

Sichuan is rich in iron ore resources throughout the province, with the areas of Weiyuan, Qijiang, and Wanyuan being the main mining areas. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were only indigenous iron smelting furnaces here, with an estimated maximum annual output of only 20,000 tons. In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the province's iron smelting equipment capacity had developed to approximately 100,000 tons. However, during the last two years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, the Kuomintang reactionary government's rampant inflation destroyed Sichuan's iron and steel industry, which had just begun to sprout. Private iron factories closed down one after another, and what remained were only indigenous iron smelting furnaces mainly serving rural areas, and the annual iron production shrank back to 20,000 tons.

Sichuan's local iron and steel industry has developed vigorously since liberation. Before 1954, in order to supply various agricultural tools and household furniture to the rural areas after the land reform, iron factories in various places generally resumed production, and on average, each farmer purchased more than two agricultural implements; iron factories in various places also supplied a large number of agricultural implements to ethnic minority areas, supporting them in changing their primitive "slash-and-burn" production methods. After 1954, iron production increased year by year, and more than half of the products began to support the state-owned iron and steel and machinery industries. From 1952 to 1957, the annual iron production increased by 480%; the production proportion of small blast furnaces with a volume of 15 cubic meters or more rose to 60.5%; and the production proportion of small blast furnaces and indigenous iron smelting with a volume of less than 15 cubic meters decreased accordingly year by year.

Before 1956, only two new small blast furnaces were built in the province, with an investment of just over 5.7 million yuan. Mainly by utilizing existing equipment, nearly 500,000 tons of iron were produced. This year, Sichuan Province increased investment in the iron and steel industry, with its capital construction investment accounting for 8.2% of the total investment in the province's twenty-odd industrial construction projects this year. These investments are mainly used for the restoration, renovation, and expansion of existing factories and mines. Currently, more than fifty capital construction projects have been started one after another, and all of them can be put into production in the second quarter of next year. The new blast furnace added to the Dongyuan Iron Plant alone can produce 10,000 tons of iron annually after its completion. The projects invested in and built this year also took into account regional balance, eliminating the three iron-producing blank spots in the Wenjiang, Nanchong, and Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and making up for the insufficient pig iron production in the Luzhou and Yibin areas.

In the process of developing the iron and steel industry, various parts of Sichuan have taken the county/city district and large factories as the center, adopted the method of large factories leading small factories and advanced ones leading backward ones, developed small blast furnaces in a satellite-like manner, and vigorously strengthened the technical management of small blast furnaces. Last year, Dazhou district/city used local technical forces to build five new small blast furnaces, which have been put into production one after another. The larger Jiangbei Iron Plant helped the key iron plant in Wanxian district/city improve its technical management, promote advanced experience, and solve many major technical problems; this key plant in Wanxian district/city in turn helped other iron plants in the district/city improve their production management. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also designated Chongqing Iron and Steel Company to help the four larger iron plants in the province, namely Jiangbei, Qianghua, Weiyuan, and Qujiang, improve their production technology. At present, various iron plants in Sichuan have mastered a relatively complete set of small blast furnace operating methods, and many iron smelting departments in other provinces have sent people to visit and study.

The Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry has now decided that all the iron plants under the Provincial Mining and Metallurgical Industry Administration, except for two, will be decentralized and led by the various district/city commissioner's offices as the main force for training local technical forces and developing small blast furnaces. The Administration will concentrate all its technical forces to help various places further improve the technical management of existing factories and mines, improve product quality, and reduce costs.

    大厂帮助小厂提高技术增建小高炉
    四川铁产量五年增长四倍多
    年产量占全国地方产铁总量一半以上
    本报讯　记者李策报道：四川省地方炼铁工业生产的铁，在第一个五年计划期间增长了四倍多。今年6月间，全省地方炼铁工业就提前完成了第一个五年计划规定的产量计划，全年产量达到全国地方产铁总量的一半以上。60％左右的铁供应了国营钢厂和国营机械工厂。
    四川铁矿资源遍布全省，威远、綦江、万源一带是主要矿区。抗日战争以前，这里只有土法炼铁炉，估计最高年产量仅有两万吨。抗日战争初期，全省炼铁设备能力曾发展到大约十万吨。但是，抗日战争最后两年和解放战争期间，国民党反动政府的恶性通货膨胀，摧残了刚露苗头的四川炼铁工业。私营铁厂纷纷倒闭，残存的仅是以农村为主要销售对象的土法炼铁炉，铁的年产量又退缩到两万来吨。
    四川地方炼铁事业在解放后有了蓬勃的发展。1954年以前，为了供应土地改革后的农村以各种农具和日用家具，各地铁厂普遍恢复生产，全省销售的农具平均每户农民购买两件以上；各地铁厂还供应给少数民族地区大批农具，支援他们改变“刀耕火种”的原始生产方式。1954年以后，铁的产量逐年增长，并且开始以半数以上的产品支援国营钢铁、机械工业。从1952年到1957年，铁的年产量增长了480％；十五立方公尺以上的小高炉的生产比重上升到60.5％；十五立方公尺以下的小高炉和土法炼铁的生产比重逐年相应地下降。
    1956年以前，全省只新建了两座小高炉，投资不过五百七十多万元，主要是利用原有设备，就生产了近五十万吨铁。今年，四川省增加了炼铁工业的投资，其基本建设投资额占全省今年二十几个工业建设项目总投资的8.2％。这些投资主要还是用来进行原有厂矿的恢复、改建和扩建。现在，五十几个基本建设工程已经陆续开工，明年第二季度可以全部投入生产。仅东原铁厂新增加的一座高炉，建成以后，就可年产铁一万吨。今年投资兴建的项目也照顾了地区平衡，消灭了温江、南充两专区和阿坝藏族自治州三个产铁空白点，弥补了沪州、宜宾两专区生铁产量的不足。
    四川各地在发展炼铁工业的过程中，以专区、大厂为中心，采取以大带小，以先进带落后的办法，卫星式地发展小高炉，并且大力加强了小高炉的技术管理。达县专区去年利用当地技术力量新建五座小高炉，已经相继投入生产。规模较大的江北铁厂帮助万县专区的重点铁厂改进技术管理，推广先进经验，解决了不少重大技术问题；万县专区这个重点厂又帮助专区内其他铁厂改进了生产管理。冶金工业部也指定重庆钢铁公司帮助省内较大的江北、强华、威远、渠江等四个铁厂提高了生产技术。现在，四川各个铁厂已经掌握了一套比较完整的小高炉操作方法，外省不少炼铁部门曾派人前来参观、学习。
    四川省工业厅现在已经决定，省矿冶工业管理局所属铁厂除留下两个以外，其余全部下放，由各专署领导，作为当地培养技术力量，发展小高炉的主力。管理局将集中所有技术力量，帮助各地进一步改进现有厂矿的技术管理，提高产品质量，降低成本。
