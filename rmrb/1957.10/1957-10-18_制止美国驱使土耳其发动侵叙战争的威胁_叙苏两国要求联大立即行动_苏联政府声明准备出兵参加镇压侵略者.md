A comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 16th, requesting an emergency meeting of the General Committee to discuss adding a new item proposed by the Syrian delegation – "Accusation of Threats to the Security of Syria and International Peace" – to the agenda of the UN General Assembly. The letter included a memorandum explaining the reasons for the Syrian government's appeal to the United Nations, requesting the United Nations General Assembly to promptly study the issues raised and take necessary measures to stop the threat to Syria's security and independence caused by the unprecedented and vigorous mobilization of Turkish troops on the Turkish-Syrian border and their continuous provocations. Syria also suggested that the United Nations General Assembly establish a committee responsible for investigating the situation on the Turkish-Syrian border and reporting to the General Assembly.

The head of the Soviet delegation to the 12th UN General Assembly, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, sent a letter to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Munro, on the same day, pointing out that the situation surrounding Syria is very tense and contains the possibility of armed conflict breaking out at any time. Turkish troops are continuing to gather on the Turkish-Syrian border, and have reached 50,000 to date. There is concrete material to prove that the Turkish General Staff, together with American military staff, has jointly formulated a detailed plan for Turkey's attack on Syria, preparing to implement it immediately after the Turkish elections on October 27. The United States has openly stated that they are prepared to send their own armed forces to stand on Turkey's side and directly participate in military action against Syria. The armed conflict created by the Turkish and American ruling groups in this region contains serious dangers to the cause of maintaining world peace. Under these circumstances, the responsibility of United Nations member states directly under the United Nations Charter is to immediately intervene in order to prevent the outbreak and expansion of war. Gromyko's letter stated that the Soviet government supports Syria's proposal: The United Nations General Assembly should immediately study the threat of military aggression facing Syria and the danger to universal peace as a result. The Soviet government also supports the suggestion of immediately establishing a special United Nations committee to carefully investigate the situation on the Turkish-Syrian border. The Soviet government also suggested that if Turkey violates the peace on the Syrian border and attacks Syria, United Nations member states should immediately provide Syria with necessary armed assistance to stop the aggression. The Soviet government declared that the Soviet Union is ready to send its own armed forces to participate in suppressing the aggressors and punishing the violators of peace.
