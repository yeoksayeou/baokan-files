Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: New York Dispatch: Saudi Arabian representative Shukairy, in his speech during the general debate at the UN General Assembly on the 2nd, condemned the Western conspiracy to interfere in Syria's internal affairs.

Shukairy opposed the suggestion by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to have the United Nations debate Middle East issues, particularly the situation in Syria. He said that Syria's affairs should be handled by Syria and should not be handled by the United Nations. We will strongly oppose any discussion involving the Syrian issue. As for the Western claim that the current Syrian government is "controlled by communists," this is a matter of who is in power and who is not. This is Syria's business, solely Syria's business.

Shukairy said that Syria's current defense deployments pose no danger to any Arab neighbors. Syria also has no malice towards Turkey. Some say that Syria obtains arms from the Soviet Union, thus endangering the security of its neighbors. However, all countries in this assembly engage in arms deals and seek arms everywhere. In this regard, Syria is neither the first nor the last. In any case, this is not a luxury for Syria. Shukairy said that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's slander in his speech at the UN General Assembly regarding the intentions of the Soviet Union in shipping weapons to Arab countries is "purely a fallacy" and "an insult to the honor of our countries, which we must unhesitatingly and immediately refute."

Shukairy said that Arab countries eagerly desire to establish the best relations with the West on the basis of equality and mutual respect. But it is Western policies that are destroying relations with the Arabs. The tension in the Middle East is caused by the remnants of Western imperialism. Western countries should resolve their differences with the Arab world in Palestine, Algeria, Yemen, Oman, and the Buraimi Oasis, in accordance with the principle of self-determination stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

In his speech, Shukairy also condemned the aggressive atrocities of France and Britain in Algeria, Oman, and Yemen.

Representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Nepal, Cambodia, Ceylon, Cuba, and Panama also spoke at the UN General Assembly on this day.

    沙特阿拉伯代表在联大仗义执言
    谴责西方阴谋干涉叙利亚内政
    反对由联合国辩论叙利亚局势
    据新华社3日讯  纽约消息：沙特阿拉伯代表舒凯里2日在联合国大会的一般辩论中发言，谴责西方阴谋干涉叙利亚内政。
    舒凯里反对美国国务卿杜勒斯提出的由联合国辩论中东问题，特别是叙利亚局势的建议。他说，叙利亚的事务应当由叙利亚来处理，不应由联合国来处理。我们将强烈反对任何涉及叙利亚问题的讨论。至于西方所说的叙利亚现政府“受共产党控制”的说法，这是谁当权谁不当权的问题，这是叙利亚的事，是叙利亚单独的事。
    舒凯里说，叙利亚目前的防御部署对任何阿拉伯邻国都不是什么危险。叙利亚对土耳其也没有恶意。有人说，叙利亚从苏联得到军火，因此危及它的邻邦的安全。然而这个大会的所有国家都从事军火交易，到处找军火。在这方面，叙利亚不是头一个也不是最后一个。无论如何这不是叙利亚的奢侈。舒凯里说，英国外交大臣劳埃德在联合国大会的发言中关于苏联运给阿拉伯国家武器的意图的污蔑“纯粹是一种谬论”，“是对我们国家的荣誉的一种侮辱，这种侮辱我们必须毫不犹豫地立即予以反击。”
    舒凯里说，阿拉伯国家热望在平等和互相尊重的基础上同西方建立最好的关系。但是正在毁坏同阿拉伯人的关系的正是西方的政策。中东的紧张局势是西方帝国主义残余所造成的。西方国家应当根据联合国宪章所规定的自决的原则来解决它们在巴勒斯坦、在阿尔及利亚、在也门、在阿曼和在布赖米绿洲的同阿拉伯世界之间的分歧。
    舒凯里在发言里还谴责了法国和英国在阿尔及利亚、阿曼和也门的侵略暴行。
    在这一天联合国大会上发言的还有波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、尼泊尔、柬埔寨、锡兰、古巴和巴拿马等国家的代表。
