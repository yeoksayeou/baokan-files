    French Government's Actions Persecuting Overseas Chinese
    By Editorial Department
    The "Qiaozhong" newspaper, funded and run by our compatriots in France, was suddenly ordered to cease publication by the French authorities on August 30th. On September 13th, the French authorities, disregarding human rights, unreasonably arrested the editorial staff of the "Qiaozhong" newspaper, subjected them to all kinds of insults, and searched their homes and bodies. Currently, the French authorities are continuing to summon our overseas Chinese in France for questioning. These unfriendly actions by France, which groundlessly persecute our overseas Chinese, cannot but arouse the indignation and attention of the Chinese people.
    The publication of the "Qiaozhong" newspaper fully complied with the relevant French laws and has a history of four years. Its reports were entirely about the motherland's ever-changing construction achievements and the living conditions of overseas Chinese in France, and never involved the political issues of the country of residence. The French authorities' order to cease publication of the newspaper is completely unreasonable. Obviously, the French authorities are attempting to create the "Qiaozhong" newspaper incident to persecute our overseas Chinese in France. This action, which undermines the friendship between the Chinese and French people, is authorized and supported by certain individuals within the French ruling group who are hostile to the new China. They are trying to obstruct the growing friendship between the Chinese and French people and suppress the increasingly louder calls from all sectors of French society for recognition of the new China.
      The "Qiaozhong" newspaper incident happened just before the visits to Taiwan by French right-wing leader and former Prime Minister Pinay and former Minister Chazelle. This is by no means accidental. Although the leaders of the French government have repeatedly stated publicly that they are willing to develop economic and cultural exchanges with our country, and even repeatedly stated that they cannot but recognize the existence of the new China with its 600 million people, the French government is doing its utmost to follow the United States and the United Kingdom, increasingly frequently colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, and stepping up its efforts to create a "two Chinas" conspiracy. Recently, right-wing leader Pinay, at the invitation of Yeh Kung-chao, paid a week-long visit to Taiwan, and right-wing member of parliament Chazelle also visited Taiwan as a representative of the French Prime Minister. The "Dapeng Opera Troupe," a Peking Opera troupe belonging to the Chiang gang's air force, will also go to France to perform next month. All this shows that some people in the French authorities are actively participating in and carrying out the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Under these circumstances, it is no accident that the French authorities created the "Qiaozhong" newspaper incident and persecuted our overseas Chinese in France. This cannot but arouse the attention of all honest French people who advocate a realistic and friendly attitude towards the new China.
    At the same time, it should be pointed out that our government has always encouraged overseas Chinese to respect the laws and social customs of their country of residence and not to participate in the political activities of their country of residence. At the same time, it is also firmly safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. The Chinese people will never allow the French authorities to wantonly persecute our overseas Chinese, and demand that France immediately stop these unfriendly actions and earnestly guarantee the legitimate rights and interests of our overseas Chinese.

    法国政府迫害华侨的举动
    本报评论员
    我国旅法侨胞集资自办的“侨众”报突于8月30日横遭法国当局勒令停刊。法国当局竟又于9月13日不顾人权，无理拘捕“侨众”报编辑人员，加以百般侮辱并抄家搜身。目前法国当局还在继续传讯我旅法华侨。法国这种无端迫害我国侨胞的不友好举动，不能不引起我国人民的愤慨和注意。
    “侨众”报的出版是完全合乎法国有关法律的规定的，并且已有四年的历史。报道内容全系祖国日新月异的建设成就和旅法侨胞的生活情况，从未涉及侨居国的政治问题。法国当局勒令该报停刊是毫无道理的。显然，法国当局企图制造“侨众”报事件迫害我旅法侨胞。这种破坏中、法两国人民友谊的行动是受到法国统治集团中某些敌视新中国的人士的授意和支持的，他们力图阻挠中、法两国人民之间日益发展的友谊和压制法国各界人士要求承认新中国的日益高涨的呼声。
      “侨众”报事件恰恰发生在法国右派领袖、前总理比内和前部长夏基诺相继访问台湾的前夕，这决不是偶然的。虽然法国政府的领导人曾经不止一次地公开表示，愿意发展同我国的经济、文化往来，甚至也一再表示不能不承认六亿人口的新中国存在的事实，法国议会外交委员会也曾在今年4月初一致通过要求政府承认新中国的议案。但是，法国政府却竭力追随美国和英国，越来越频繁地同台湾蒋介石集团勾勾搭搭，加紧制造“两个中国”的阴谋。最近右派领袖比内应叶公超邀请到台湾进行了为期一周的访问，右派议员夏基诺也以法国总理代表的身份访问了台湾。蒋帮空军属下的京剧班子“大鹏剧社”也将于下月赴法国演出。这一切都说明法国当局中某些人正在积极参加和进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动。在这种情况下，法国当局制造“侨众”报事件，迫害我旅法华侨决不是偶然的。这不能不引起一切主张对新中国采取现实和友好态度的正直的法国人士的注意。
    同时应该指出，我国政府一向是勉励国外侨胞尊重侨居国的法律和社会习惯，不参加侨居国的政治活动的，同时也是坚决维护国外侨胞的正当权利和利益的。中国人民决不容许法国当局蛮横迫害我国侨胞，要求法国立即停止这种不友好的举动，切实保障我国侨胞的正当权益。
