    Yangzhou Special District Peasants Overcome Passive Thinking of Waiting for Rain
    Confidently Fight Drought and Rush Planting
    (By Our Correspondent)
    This newspaper dispatch. Since the start of autumn, the basic-level cadres of Yangzhou Special District, Jiangsu Province, have used the method of extensive debate in their drought resistance and autumn planting work to unify understanding, so that a massive mass drought resistance and rush planting movement has been rapidly launched.
    Since the beginning of autumn, the Yangzhou Special District has not had rain for two months, and cultivation is relatively difficult. Many cadres and masses have different views on when to complete the autumn planting. In Tai'an Township, Hanjiang County, some advocated "waiting for rain from the sky before planting," while others advocated "overcoming difficulties to fight drought and rush planting." The Tai'an Township Party organization then held a forum for cooperative cadres and members to conduct debates. At the meeting, those who advocated "waiting for rain before planting" believed that "the plow and rake should be put away at the beginning of light snow", emphasizing the difficulties of drought resistance. They said that autumn planting was still early. Those who advocated drought resistance and rush planting believed that "planting wheat early for ten years is skillful for ten years." Members of the Fenghuang and QinJian cooperatives cited the fact that wheat planted before the Frost’s Descent last year yielded 140 jin, while wheat planted after the Beginning of Winter only yielded 70 jin, which persuaded the erroneous idea of "waiting for rain before planting." In Baoying County, all districts universally debated "the advantages and disadvantages of early planting and late planting" at the meeting of cadres above the production team leader of agricultural cooperatives. After the debate, it was unanimously agreed that "the season waits for no one" and "planting one more mu is one more mu, and one day earlier is one day better." At the same time, it was recognized that the masses have many years of drought resistance experience, and most areas have water sources. As long as the role of labor, cattle, and tools is fully utilized, the task of drought resistance and rush planting can be completed in a timely manner. After the debate, the responsibility system of "fixed fields, fixed people, fixed cattle, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed work" was universally implemented. In Qingshan Township, Yizheng County, there was not enough cattle for plowing. After the debate, the cooperative members proposed "four no-uses" for plowing cattle: no use for rice milling, no use for threshing, no use for cultivating private plots, and no use for breaking clods (tilled soil), so as to concentrate cattle power on autumn plowing and autumn planting. On the first day, the sixth team of Kangxing Cooperative in Jingjiang County only irrigated nine mu of wheat and grass (Jingjiang is accustomed to mixed planting of wheat and green manure, and the method is to mix the seeds with mud and water and pour them into the field), which was very slow. The cooperative cadres and members conducted research and debate together, and found out the reasons such as "chaotic production order, and doing work in a rush." It was because the cadres did not participate in production and the labor force was not properly allocated. The cadres accepted this opinion, participated in labor, and rationally divided the labor force. The next day, with the same amount of labor, they irrigated thirteen mu of wheat and grass, and also carried three hundred loads of ash and pulled up rice stubble in ten mu of fields.
    After the debate, the confidence of the cadres in leading the drought resistance and rush planting was enhanced, and the enthusiasm of the masses was mobilized. The drought resistance and rush planting movement was quickly launched in various places. At present, all rural labor, cattle power, and farm tools have been put into this movement. As of the beginning of October, more than one million mu have been planted to resist drought and rush planting. More than 50,000 farmers in Jiangpu County used more than 3,000 waterwheels, working day and night shifts, to moisten the soil and plant more than 50,000 mu of wheat. The 120,000 mu with water sources in the county can be planted before the 20th. The area of autumn plowing and autumn planting in Jiangdu County this year is four times faster than in the same period in previous years. Baoying County has already planted more than 200,000 mu to resist drought and rush planting.

    扬州专区农民克服消极等雨思想
    满怀信心抗旱抢种
    本报讯  江苏省扬州专区基层干部在抗旱秋种工作中，运用大辩论的方法，统一了认识，使规模巨大的群众性的抗旱抢种运动迅速展开。
    扬州专区入秋以来，已有两个月未下雨，耕种困难较大，不少干部、群众对何时完成秋种的问题，有各种不同的看法。邗江县太安乡有的主张“等天下雨再种”，有的主张“克服困难抗旱抢种”。太安乡党组织便召开社干社员座谈会，进行辩论。会上，主张“等雨再种”的人认为“小雪住犁耙”，强调抗旱的困难，他们说，秋种为时还早；主张抗旱抢种的人认为“种麦十年早，十年都讨巧”。凤凰、勤俭两社的社员举出去年霜降前种的麦子，收到一百四十斤，而立冬后种的只收七十斤的事实，才说服了“等雨再种”的错误说法。宝应县各区在农业合作社生产队长以上干部会议上普遍辩论了“早种和迟种的利害关系”。经过辩论，一致认为“季节不等人”，“多种一亩是一亩，早种一天好一天”；同时也认识到群众有多年的抗旱经验，大部分地区有水源，只要充分发挥劳力、牛力、工具的作用，可以及时完成抗旱抢种的任务。辩论后，普遍推行了“定田、定人、定牛、定时、定质、定工”的责任制。仪征县青山乡耕牛不够用，辩论后，社员提出耕牛“四不用”：碾米不用，打场不用，耕自留地不用，打垡（翻耕过的土块）不用，以便把牛力集中用于秋耕秋种。靖江县康兴社六队第一天只浇九亩田麦草（靖江习惯麦子和绿肥混种，方法是用泥水把种子混和起来浇到田里），进度很慢。社干与社员一起进行研究和辩论，找出了“生产秩序混乱，做活一窝蜂”等原因，是干部没有参加生产，劳力调配不当。干部接受了这个意见，参加劳动，将劳力进行合理分工，第二天同样多的劳力，浇了十三亩田麦草，还挑三百担灰，拔了十亩田稻桩。
    经过辩论，提高了干部领导抗旱抢种的信心，调动了群众的积极性，抗旱抢种运动很快在各地展开。目前农村所有劳力、牛力、农具都已投入这一运动。到10月上旬止，已抗旱抢种一百多万亩。江浦县五万多农民运用三千多部水车，分日夜两班润土种麦五万多亩，全县有水源的十二万亩可在20日前种完。江都县今年秋耕秋种的田亩比往年同期快四倍。宝应县已经抗旱抢种二十多万亩。
