    The First Big-Character Poster
    Just after the Party Branch Secretary finished the report on "Launching a great airing of views and debates, and carrying out rectification throughout the school," the "Airing Views Garden" for posting big-character posters was being set up in full swing, and the first big-character poster was posted.
    This was written by Teacher Wang Fuzhen of the Physical Education Department. She criticized the General Affairs Section for buying paste at three cents a bottle for posting big-character posters and suggested making the paste themselves.
    Old Guan from the General Affairs Section was busy setting up the big-character poster area. After reading the first big-character poster, he suddenly realized, "This suggestion is right!" Section Chief Zhao, who was setting it up with Old Guan, said, "Quickly find someone to make paste!" The Party Branch Secretary read it and exclaimed, "The masses are so thoughtful and considerate!—Correct opinions must be changed immediately." So, in a short while, a basin of steaming paste made from the bottom of a flour sack used to hold coarse flour was brought over.

    第一张大字报
    党总支书记刚作完“开展大鸣大放，开展全校整风”的报告，张贴大字报的“鸣放园地”正在紧张的布置中，第一张大字报就贴出来了。
    这是体育学科王福贞老师写的，她针对着总务科买三角钱一瓶的浆子供贴大字报用的事提出批评并建议自己打浆子。
    总务科的老关正为搞大字报的园地而忙碌着，看了这第一张大字报恍然大悟地说：“这意见对呀”。和老关一起布置着的赵科长说：“赶快找人打浆子”。总支书记看了感叹地说：“群众想得真细、真周到呀！——意见正确马上就改”。于是，不一会儿，一盆还冒着热气的用装黑面的面袋底子打的浆子端来了。
