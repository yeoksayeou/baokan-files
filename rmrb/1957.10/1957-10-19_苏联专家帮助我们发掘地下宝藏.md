Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th – Guangdong Province, which once had many blank spots on the national geological map, is now proven to be one of China's provinces with rich polymetallic mineral deposits. This is the result of several years of exploration with the help of Soviet experts.

　　The large crystal mine on Hainan Island, now famous throughout the country, was already being mined on a small scale a few years ago. However, there was insufficient understanding of its scale, prospects, and academic significance. In 1954, with the help of Soviet experts, it was determined that this was a crystal mine with rich reserves and high quality.

　　The large iron mine explored on Hainan Island not long ago is a rare high-quality iron mine in China. Most of the extracted ore can be directly put into open-hearth furnaces for smelting without processing. During the exploration of this iron mine, Soviet experts suggested reducing the density of the exploration grid based on the occurrence and grade stability of the ore body. At a time when Chinese geologists lacked experience, this suggestion was of great significance, reducing the originally planned workload by two to three times and completing the exploration task one year ahead of schedule.

　　The scheelite mine discovered in northern Guangdong last year was not fully appreciated by Chinese geological personnel in terms of its reserves and quality. However, with the help of Soviet experts, it was confirmed to be an extremely large scheelite mine. Two abandoned lead-zinc mines were also re-evaluated under the appraisal of Soviet experts and proved to be two large lead-zinc mines.

　　Before liberation, Chinese geologists rarely seriously studied the tin mines in Guangdong. After several years of joint exploration by Soviet experts, it was proven that Guangdong's tin ore reserves are also very rich.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 18th – Jiangxi Province's geological exploration work has continuously received guidance and assistance from Soviet experts in recent years.

　　Since 1953, dozens of mineral types have been discovered through geological exploration in this province, and many new mining areas with exploitable value have been identified. During the exploration process, several Soviet experts in geology have come here many times to assist in the work.

　　Soviet expert Zverev visited the Gan Northeast copper mine twice. During his first visit to the copper mine, based on the preliminary geological data and on-site observations, he helped Chinese engineers confirm the type of ore deposit here. He also put forward reasonable suggestions for the deployment of the exploration grid, helping us to explore more reserves with the least amount of drilling work. Soviet expert Moshnikov also played a significant role in the selection of the Gan Northeast lead-zinc mining area.

　　Soviet experts worked diligently, arduously, and seriously. Although they only stayed in each mining area for a few days, they always quickly helped the exploration personnel to solve problems, and regardless of the high mountains and dangerous roads, they insisted on personally observing the site.

### 苏联专家帮助我们发掘地下宝藏

　　苏联专家帮助我们发掘地下宝藏
    据新华社广州18日电  在全国地质图上曾经有很多空白点的广东省，现在证明是我国有着丰富的多金属矿藏的省份之一。这是几年来苏联专家帮助勘查的结果。
    现在已经闻名全国的海南岛大水晶矿，几年前我们已经进行了小规模的开采。但是对于它的规模、远景及其学术意义都认识不足。1954年，在苏联专家帮助下才确定了这是一个蕴藏丰富而且质量很高的水晶矿。
    不久前在海南岛勘探的大铁矿，是我国少有的高质量铁矿，开采出来的矿石大部分都不需要加工便可以直接投入平炉冶炼。在这个铁矿进行勘探的时候，苏联专家根据矿体产状和品位稳定情况，建议减小勘探网密度。在当时我国地质工作者缺乏经验的情况下，这个建议具有很重大的意义，它使原定的工作量减少二到三倍，而且提前一年完成了勘探任务。
    去年在广东北部发现的白钨矿，我国地质人员对它的蕴藏量和质量都认识不足。但是在苏联专家帮助下证实了这是一个极大的白钨矿。已经作废的两个铅锌矿，也在苏联专家的鉴定下作了重新的评价，它被证明是两个大的铅锌矿。
    解放前，中国的地质学家很少认真研究过广东的锡矿，经过几年来苏联专家协同勘查的结果，证明广东锡矿蕴藏也很丰富。
    据新华社南昌18日电  江西省地质勘探工作几年来不断获得苏联专家的指导和帮助。
    这个省从1953年起经过地质勘查发现了几十种矿种，确定了许多有开采价值的新矿区。在勘查过程中，前后曾有几位地质方面的苏联专家多次来到这里协助工作。
    苏联专家兹维列夫曾经两次到赣东北铜矿。他第一次到铜矿时就根据普查地质资料和现场观察，帮助我国工程师肯定了这里的矿床类型。他还对勘探网的部署提出了合理的建议，帮助我们用最少的钻探工作量，勘探出较多的储量。苏联专家莫什尼柯夫对赣东北铅锌矿区的选择也起了很大作用。
    苏联专家工作时，都是认真、艰苦和严肃的。他们每到一个矿区虽然为时只有几天，但总是很快地帮助勘探人员着手解决问题，不管山高路险，一定要亲自到现场观察。
