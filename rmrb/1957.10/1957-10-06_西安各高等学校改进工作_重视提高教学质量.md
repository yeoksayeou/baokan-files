Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch: While thoroughly carrying out the anti-Rightist struggle, various universities in the Xi'an area are vigorously improving their work. Up to now, most of the opinions put forward by teachers, students, and staff during the blooming and contending period have been addressed and explained.

The improvement work in various schools is mostly centered on enhancing the quality of teaching. According to student opinions, Northwest University has newly hired more than 50 teachers this semester, added many teaching facilities, and many departments have also increased elective courses and specialized courses. In addition, new German, French, and Japanese language teaching and research sections have been established. The Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering has revised a total of 25 teaching plans for various grades and majors. During the summer vacation, the library of this institute has rearranged and cataloged more than 120,000 copies of original and new books. Some professors, associate professors, and lecturers of Xi'an Medical College who did not participate in the outpatient clinics of affiliated hospitals in the past have begun to participate in outpatient clinics regularly to better cooperate with teaching. This semester, Xi'an Institute of Physical Education streamlined several courses that were not closely related to the major, and added new courses such as medical supervision according to needs.

The working style of leading cadres in various schools has also been greatly improved compared to the past. Yue Jieheng, Vice President of Northwest University, recently personally led relevant personnel from the Academic Affairs and General Affairs Departments to inspect the laboratories and teaching equipment of the Law, Biology, and Geology Departments. They promptly put forward handling opinions on problems such as instruments, medicines, and specimens being discarded randomly and no one being responsible.

Regarding the ideological education of students in socialism, Xi'an Institute of Physical Education has set up class counselors and political instructors in each class of undergraduate, junior college, and other grades. At the beginning of the semester, Northwest University announced seven regulations and measures such as current affairs education, which have now begun to be implemented on a trial basis. Various universities in the Xi'an area have also made active improvements in school welfare and other issues.

    西安各高等学校改进工作
    重视提高教学质量
    据新华社西安电　西安地区各高等学校在深入开展反右派斗争的同时，大力改进工作。到目前为止，鸣放期间各校师生员工提出的意见，大部得到了处理和交代。
    各学校改进工作，多数是以提高教学质量为中心来进行的。西北大学根据学生意见，本学期新聘了五十多位教师，增添了许多教学设备，不少系科还增加了选修课和专门化课程，另外又新成立了德、法、日语教研组。西安建筑工程学院已修订了各年级各专业的教学计划共二十五种。这个学院图书馆在暑期中已将原库存图书和新书十二万多册重新安排编目。西安医学院过去一些不参加附属医院门诊的教授、副教授、讲师等已开始定期参加门诊，以便更好配合教学。西安体育学院本学期精简了若干和专业联系不大的课程，根据需要增开了医务督导等新课程。
    各校领导干部的工作作风也比过去有了很大改进。西北大学副校长岳劼恒最近亲自带领教务、总务两处有关人员，一同到法律、生物、地质等系检查实验室和教学设备，他们对仪器、药品、标本乱扔乱放、无人负责等问题及时提出了处理意见。
    关于学生的社会主义思想教育工作，西安体育学院已在本科、专科等各年级中，按班别设立了班辅导和政治辅导员。西北大学在开学初公布了时事教育等七项规定和办法，现在都已开始试行。西安地区各高等学校对校内生活福利等问题，也都作了积极的改进。
