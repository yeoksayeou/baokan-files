    Establishing Connections with Agricultural Cooperatives
    In recent weeks, teachers, staff, and students from Beijing Normal University have been seen participating in voluntary labor in agricultural production cooperatives in areas such as Dazhongsi, Wudaokou, Madian, Tayuan, and North Taipingzhuang. The university's labor union and student union have established regular contact with these cooperatives, organizing everyone to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor in a planned manner. The labor union has a dedicated person to liaise with the cooperatives, drafting bi-weekly plans, ensuring that everyone has one labor opportunity per week, with teachers and staff able to choose to participate according to their schedules. The student union organizes everyone to go to the countryside for labor every Sunday, with each person able to go once every two weeks; during vacations, there will be more time for voluntary labor in the countryside.
    In addition, voluntary labor on campus is also being planned by the General Affairs Department in conjunction with the labor union and student union. Party committees, Communist Youth League committees, and some administrative departments of the university have already had staff clean their offices, and students are responsible for cleaning all classrooms.
    The practice of regularly organizing voluntary labor has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses. Currently, teachers, students, and staff from all departments have already participated in labor once.

    同农业社建立联系
    近几个星期，在大钟寺、五道口、马甸、塔院、北太平庄等农业生产合作社都能看到北京师范大学的教师、职员和同学进行义务劳动。师大工会和学生会同这几个社建立了经常的联系，有计划地组织大家下乡参加农业劳动。工会有专人和合作社联系，订出半月计划，每周每人都有一次劳动机会，教师职员可以根据自己的时间选择参加。学生会每星期日组织大家下乡劳动，每人每两个星期可去一次；在假期，将有更多时间下乡义务劳动。
    此外，在校内的义务劳动，也已经由总务科和工会、学生会联系，订出计划进行。党、团委会，校部一些行政部门已经由工作人员打扫办公室，教室一律由学生负责打扫。
    经常组织义务劳动的作法，受到了广大群众热烈的欢迎。现在，各系师生和职员都已经劳动过一次。
