Old Expert Kukushkin

　　In the frigid north, scorching south, towering mountains of the southwest, and boundless deserts of the northwest of our country, there are Soviet experts tirelessly assisting us in our construction endeavors. Among them are some elderly experts who have forsaken their retirement years to contribute their valuable experience to our nation's construction. Ivan Ivanovich Kukushkin, an old chemical expert working at the newly built Jilin Fertilizer Plant, is one of them. Kukushkin is sixty-five years old this year, with silvery whiskers and over forty years of work experience. During the plant's construction, he tirelessly devoted himself, selflessly imparting his superb skills to our Chinese staff. Thanks to his efforts and those of other Soviet experts, a complete set of technical personnel has been trained for the Jilin Fertilizer Plant. (Attached picture)

　　老专家库库什金
    在我国严寒的北方、炎热的南部、西南的丛山峻岭和西北的无垠沙漠上，都有苏联专家在不辞劳苦地帮助我们进行建设工作，其中有些是年老的专家，他们放弃了晚年的休养生活，把宝贵的经验贡献给我国的建设事业。在新建的吉林肥料厂里工作的老化学专家伊·伊·库库什金，就是其中的一位。库库什金今年六十五岁，银须苍苍，有四十多年的工作经验。他在建厂过程中，日日夜夜地操心操劳，把精湛的技术无保留地传授给我国职工，由于他和其他苏联专家的努力，已为吉林肥料厂培养了成套的技术干部。（附图片）
