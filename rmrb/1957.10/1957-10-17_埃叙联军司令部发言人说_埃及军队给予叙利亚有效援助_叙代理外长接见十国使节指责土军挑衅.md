Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 16th - According to a report in Cairo's "Al Akhbar" on the 15th, the spokesman of the Egyptian-Syrian Joint Military Command, in an interview with the newspaper's reporter, said that the Egyptian troops sent to Syria were "to provide effective military assistance to the Syrian army to prevent any aggression," and not to display military strength or conduct psychological warfare against any country.

The spokesman said, "The Egyptian troops sent to Syria are combat troops. They include armored units, infantry, and artillery. This army has heavy tanks and military experts and engineers from various branches." These troops are not symbolic, but elite troops selected from the best in the Egyptian army.

He also said that this force is divided into two parts. The first part is prepared to participate in any military operations that the Syrian army may conduct, and the other part is a force to train Syrian soldiers in the use of modern weapons. He said that the Egyptian Air Force that flew to Syria to cover the ships transporting Egyptian troops "will remain there indefinitely."

The spokesman said that the first batch of Egyptian troops arrived in Syria when General Bizri, Commander-in-Chief of the Syrian Armed Forces, visited Cairo on September 11 and 12 and held talks with President Nasser. He said that the arrival of Egyptian troops would not be officially announced until the last Egyptian soldier landed.

He said that Egyptian troops have now been assigned to various units of the Syrian army "to carry out any military plans stipulated by the Syrian army headquarters in cooperation with the Joint Command of the Egyptian and Syrian Armed Forces."

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 16th - Syrian Acting Foreign Minister Kalas successively received the diplomatic envoys of ten countries, including Iraq, China, India, Yugoslavia, Jordan, Indonesia, Greece, Egypt, the Soviet Union, and the United States, on October 15 to explain to them the situation of Turkey's troop buildup on the Syrian border.

According to Syrian Radio, Kalas pointed out that Turkey's troop buildup on the Syrian border constitutes a serious threat to Syria's security and peace in the Middle East.

Kalas told the envoys that these troop concentrations are far from being the military exercises that Turkey claims. He said that this can only be said to be a pre-planned aggression that Turkey intends to launch against Syria.

Kalas pointed out that the Turks themselves know very well that Syria does not pose any threat to them; Syria has not concentrated its troops on their border and does not intend to take any action against Turkey.

Kalas issued a statement after meeting with the foreign envoys saying that the Syrian government is considering submitting the issue to the United Nations.

    埃叙联军司令部发言人说
    埃及军队给予叙利亚有效援助
    叙代理外长接见十国使节指责土军挑衅
    新华社开罗16日电　据开罗“消息报”15日报道，埃及—叙利亚联合军事司令部发言人在接见这家报纸记者的时候说，埃及派遣军队到叙利亚去是“为了当前同叙利亚军队配合以防止任何侵略而给予的有效军事援助”，而并不是显示军力，或者对任何国家进行神经战。
    这位发言人说，“派到叙利亚去的埃及军队是战斗部队。它包括装甲部队、步兵和炮兵，这支军队中有着重型坦克和各种兵种的军事专家和工兵。”这些部队不是象征性的，而是从埃及最好的军队中选拔出来的精锐部队。
    他还说，这支部队分成两部分。第一部分准备参加叙利亚军队可能进行的任何军事行动，另一部分是为了训练叙利亚士兵使用现代武器的部队。他说，掩护运送埃及军队的船只而飞到叙利亚的埃及空军“将无限期地留在那里”。
    这位发言人说，第一批埃及军队是在叙利亚武装部队总司令比兹里将军9月11日和12日访问开罗，同纳赛尔总统举行会谈的时候到达叙利亚的。他说，只有到埃及部队的最后一名士兵登陆的时候才正式宣布埃及军队到达。
    他说，埃及军队现在已经被分派到叙利亚军队的各个单位，“去执行叙利亚军队司令部在同埃叙武装部队联合司令部合作下规定的任何军事计划”。
    据新华社大马士革16日电　叙利亚代理外交部长卡拉斯10月15日连续接见了伊拉克、中国、印度、南斯拉夫、约旦、印度尼西亚、希腊、埃及、苏联和美国等十国的外交使节，向他们说明了土耳其在叙利亚的边界上集结的情况。
    据叙利亚广播电台报道，卡拉斯指出，土耳其在叙边界上集结军队构成了对叙利亚安全和中东和平的严重威胁。
    卡拉斯向这些使节们说，这些军队的集结远不是土耳其所说的军事演习。他说，这只能说是土耳其打算对叙利亚发动事先策划好的侵略。
    卡拉斯指出，土耳其人自己知道得很清楚，叙利亚对他们并不构成任何威胁；叙利亚并没有把它的军队集结在他们的边界上，并且不打算采取任何反对土耳其的行动。
    卡拉斯在接见外国使节后发表声明说，叙利亚政府正在考虑把这个问题提交联合国。
