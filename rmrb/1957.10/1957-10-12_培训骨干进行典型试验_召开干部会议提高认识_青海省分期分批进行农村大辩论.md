According to the Qinghai Daily, Qinghai Province is conducting socialist debates in rural areas in stages and batches according to plan. Of the more than 2,400 agricultural cooperatives in the entire agricultural area, more than 900 have launched large-scale debates.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the socialist education movement in rural areas, starting in late August, the provincial leading organs transferred 338 cadres from provincial-level organs (including 17 at the department and bureau director level and 34 at the section and division chief level) to assist in the work in various counties in the agricultural area and Xining City. Together with the cadres sent by various counties and cities and the original cadres in the townships, there are currently more than 4,000 cadres who have arrived in the rural areas to lead the peasants in conducting the socialist debates. In the process of preparation, in addition to cultivating and training a large number of activists and key personnel in the rural areas, various counties and cities also selected one or two townships or agricultural cooperatives to conduct typical trials. A total of 47 agricultural cooperatives were piloted in 16 townships across the province, and experience was gained, creating favorable conditions for carrying out work in batches and stages.

In the early stage of launching the large-scale debates, various counties and cities successively convened three-level cadre meetings, township general branch secretary meetings, and agricultural cooperative cadre meetings to publicize various policies, impart working methods, and severely criticize the departmentalism and right-leaning sentiments existing among some township and cooperative cadres, thereby raising ideological awareness. The Communist Party Committee of Hualong County convened meetings of township general branch secretaries twice in succession and criticized the ideological sentiments of some cadres who were afraid of "losing control," afraid of "offending people," planning to ambush the state by selling less surplus grain, and being simplistic and impatient.

Through this period of extensive airing of views, great contention, and large-scale debates, farmers of all ethnic groups have a clear understanding of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and have expressed their willingness to sell more surplus grain to the state, deliver grain first, deliver good grain, and support national construction. On September 15, the agricultural cooperatives in Heping Township, Xining City, organized more than 140 carts and more than 100 livestock to deliver public grain, and delivered 170,000 catties of public grain to the state in one go. Gaozhai Agricultural Cooperative also sold more than 50,000 catties of surplus grain.

Regarding the issue of cooperation, the vast majority of farmers believe that "the road of cooperation is the right one." Tibetan farmers in Dayang Cooperative, Jinta Township, Huangzhong County, used facts to illustrate the benefits of cooperation. In 1949, the average yield of wheat per mu in this cooperative was 130 catties, barley was 180 catties, and peas were 122 catties; but in 1956, the average yield of wheat per mu reached 333 catties, barley per mu reached 360 catties, and peas per mu reached 210 catties. The lives of farmers have also greatly improved. In 1949, only 13 households in the entire cooperative were self-sufficient in food grain, accounting for 23.2% of the total number of farm households; in 1956, there were 60 households with surplus grain, accounting for 81% of the total number of farm households, and every household had cotton quilts and cotton clothes. After presenting these facts, the members said: Isn't this the benefit of cooperation? If anyone says that cooperation is not good, our Tibetan farmers can also reason with him!

### 培训骨干进行典型试验　召开干部会议提高认识  青海省分期分批进行农村大辩论

    培训骨干进行典型试验　召开干部会议提高认识
    青海省分期分批进行农村大辩论
    据青海日报消息　青海省农村的社会主义大辩论，正在分期分批有计划地进行。全农业区二千四百多个农业社中，已有九百多个开展了大辩论。
    为了加强农村社会主义教育运动的领导，从8月下旬开始，省领导机关即从省级各机关抽调干部三百三十八人（其中厅部长级干部十七人，科处长级三十四人）分赴农业区各县及西宁市协助工作。连同各县市派赴和各乡原有干部，目前共有四千多名干部到达农村领导农民进行社会主义大辩论。各县市在准备过程中，除分别培养训练了一大批农村中的积极分子骨干力量以外，还选择了一至两个乡或农业社进行典型试办，全省共在十六个乡中试办了四十七个农业社，取得了经验，给分批分期开展工作创造了良好条件。
    在开展大辩论的初期，各县市都先后召开了三级干部会、乡总支书记和农业社干部等会议，宣传了各项政策，交给了工作方法，并且严肃的批判了某些乡、社干部存在的本位主义和右倾情绪，提高了思想认识。中共化隆县委会曾先后两次召集各乡总支书记开会，对于部分干部怕“放乱了收不住”、怕“得罪人”、准备向国家打埋伏少卖余粮和简单急躁等思想情绪，进行了批判。
    通过这一时期的大鸣大放大争，各族农民对于粮食统购统销政策，有了明确的认识，并表示要向国家多多卖余粮，先交粮，交好粮，支援国家建设。西宁市和平乡各农业社于9月15日，组织了一百四十多辆大车和一百多头牲畜送公粮，一次即向国家交纳公粮十七万斤，高寨农业社还卖余粮五万多斤。
    对于合作化的问题，绝大多数农民认为：“合作化的道路是走对了”。湟中金塔乡达阳社藏族农民，用事实说明了合作化的好处。1949年，这个社的小麦产量每亩平均是一百三十斤，青稞一百八十斤，豌豆一百二十二斤；但1956年的小麦每亩平均产量就达到三百三十三斤，青稞每亩三百六十斤，豌豆每亩二百一十斤。农民生活也有了很大改善。1949年，全社口粮可以自足的仅有十三户，占总农户23.2％；1956年余粮户即有六十户，占总农户81％，而且家家户户都有棉被盖，棉衣穿。摆了这些事实以后，社员们说：这不是合作化的好处是啥？如果谁再说合作化不好，我们藏族农民还可以给他说说道理！
