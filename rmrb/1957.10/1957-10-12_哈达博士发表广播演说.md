Xinhua News Agency, 11th -- Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast tonight a radio address by Dr. Hatta, former Vice President of Indonesia, to Chinese listeners. The full text is as follows:

Respected listeners:

As my entourage and I prepare to leave China, a country we have visited for three weeks, I should like to say a few parting words to the Chinese people. At the same time, we express our deepest gratitude for the immeasurable kindness shown to us by the Chinese people and for the pure and heartfelt friendship they have shown us, which we cherish.

During these three weeks, we traveled all over China, from the South to the Northeast, from the East to the West, and then to the Southeast. Although we traveled such a long distance by plane, in reality, we saw very little of China, a vast country that forms a continent in itself. But in this country, wherever we went, we were always greeted with warm, cordial, and friendly welcomes.

From the moment we set foot on Chinese soil until the moment we left this country, we never felt like we were abroad. Everywhere we went, we were treated as if we were family. We could not understand their language, but we always understood their kind words and feelings.

Indeed, we came here as friends and were received as friends. At the same time, we were sent home as close friends. May the friendship we felt during our visit develop into an even closer friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples. I say a closer friendship because there is already a close friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia. The common destiny of our two countries in the shackles of foreign colonialism and imperialism in the past, and the common goals of our two nations, these two facts compel us to engage in contact and cooperation in all aspects and to the fullest extent possible.

From the recent relations between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China, it can be seen that the ideological differences between the two countries have not become an obstacle to our close cooperation. Even if there are ideological differences between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia, our goals are the same, which is to ensure the prosperity and happiness of our respective peoples. For the prosperity and happiness of our people, our two countries should do everything in our power to carry out massive construction. In order to ensure that construction is not hindered, we need a peaceful environment at home and abroad, especially a world peace free from the threat of war, so that we can concentrate all our efforts and wisdom on construction. Because of this common goal, Indonesia and China have found it easy to engage in contact in various international aspects in a spirit of mutual understanding since they each achieved independence and autonomy. It was this atmosphere of mutual understanding that led us to the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in 1955. The Asian-African Conference, which made ten resolutions, proved in fact that countries with different ideologies can engage in contact and cooperation within a certain scope and ensure world peace. The various countries of Asia and Africa were able to unanimously declare at the historic meeting in Bandung: first, they condemned colonialism because colonialism violates humanity and justice; second, they recognized that countries with different ideologies are possible to coexist in this world; and third, they condemned the use of atomic energy for war needs. All of these are based on the ideal of striving for lasting peace. In order to strive for the realization of the ideals in the ten resolutions agreed upon in Bandung, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia need to cooperate in an atmosphere of increasingly close friendship. If my visit can contribute to promoting this already close friendship, then no one would be happier than I.

The People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia have already demonstrated by action that countries with different ideologies can coexist. I hope that through expanding mutual understanding and the desire to mutually respect each other's independence and sovereignty, coexistence will gradually expand to the whole world. In this way, this world will be in an environment of peace and security. Therefore, I very much hope that the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia can set an even more convincing example than they do now, that is, how countries with different ideologies can coexist peacefully in this world, which appears narrow due to advances in science and technology and the development of various means of transportation.

Now, as I am about to leave Chinese soil, I would like to thank the government of the People's Republic of China, who invited me to visit here, because this visit has enabled me to see with my own eyes the construction that the Chinese government and people have jointly undertaken, the difficulties they face and overcome, and the ways in which they overcome these enormous difficulties. It would be inappropriate to describe everything I have seen here one by one, because it would take a lot of time and it would not be possible to mention everything. I do not need to tell the Chinese people themselves, who are carrying out construction with difficulties and shortcomings every day. I can say that the improvements and construction that the Chinese government and people have made in such a short period of time often surprise and amaze people. I have seen that there is a change in the hearts of the Chinese nation and people, because without this psychological change, you would probably not be able to build factories, schools, and cooperatives so quickly. Here, I see that you are disciplined, organized, responsible, and confident in your labor. I know that there are still more undertakings that you need to make and construct so that all the people can enjoy social welfare. The undertakings that you need to make are much more than what you have already built, but everything you have already done, I think, is enough to inspire you and make people believe that the Chinese people have mastered their own future destiny.

I wish the Chinese people safe success in their construction. In such a short and incomplete visit, I have learned a lot from you about your construction methods and how to overcome difficulties and correct mistakes.

Finally, I pay my respects and say goodbye to you.

May the friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia last forever!

　　哈达博士发表广播演说
    新华社11日讯  中央人民广播电台今晚广播了印度尼西亚前副总统哈达博士向中国听众的广播演讲。全文如下：尊敬的听众们：
    当我和我的随行人员要离开我们已经访问了三个星期的中国的时候，我应该向中国人民讲几句告别的话。在告别的同时，我们对中国人民所给予我们的难以报答的恩情以及对我们所表示的出自纯洁的内心的、我们所珍惜的友情，表示万分感激。
    在这三个星期的时间里，我们走遍了中国，从南方到东北，从东部到西部，后来又到东南部。虽然我们乘飞机走了那么远的路程，但实际上我们在中国这样辽阔的、单独形成一个洲的国家里所看到的还是很少。但是在这个国家里，无论到那一个地方，我们总是受到热烈、亲切和友好的欢迎。
    从我们踏上中国的国土直到我们离开这个国家的时刻，我们始终就没有感觉到是在国外，不论在什么地方，我们总是受到像对待自己的亲人一样的接待。我们听不懂他们的语言，可是我们时刻都领会到他们的善良的话语和心声。
    的确，我们是作为朋友来到这里，并受到朋友般的接待的。同时，我们也作为亲密的朋友被欢送回国。但愿在我们的访问中所感受到的友谊，能够发展成为中华民族和印度尼西亚民族之间更加密切的友谊。我说的是更加密切的友谊，因为中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国之间已经有了密切的友谊。我们两个国家过去在外国殖民主义和帝国主义枷锁的桎梏下的共同命运，和我们两个民族的共同目标，这两个事实迫使我们在各方面和在一切可能的范围内进行接触与合作。
    从最近几年来印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国之间的关系中可以看出，两国之间意识形态的区别并没有成为我们紧密合作的障碍。即使在中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国之间存在着意识形态上的区别，但是我们的目标是一致的，这就是为了我们各自的人民的繁荣和幸福的生活。为了人民的繁荣和幸福的生活，我们两国应当尽我们所有的力量进行巨大的建设。为了使建设不受阻碍，我们需要国内和国际的和平环境，尤其是我们非常需要摆脱战争威胁的世界和平，使我们能够集中一切力量和智慧来进行建设。由于这个共同的目标，印度尼西亚和中国自从各自取得了独立自主以后，两国就容易以相互谅解的精神在国际上的各个方面进行接触。正是这种相互谅解的气氛，促使我们走向1955年在万隆举行的亚非会议。作出十项决议的亚非会议以事实证明，不同意识形态的国家能够在一定的范围内进行接触和合作以及保障世界和平。亚洲和非洲的各种不同的国家在万隆举行的具有历史意义的会议上能够一致宣布：第一、它们谴责殖民主义，因为殖民主义违反人道和正义；第二、它们承认在这个世界上不同意识形态的国家是可能共处的；第三、它们谴责把原子能用于战争需要的行为。所有这些都是基于争取持久和平的理想。为了争取实现在万隆所同意的十项决议中的理想，中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国需要在日益密切的友谊气氛中的合作。假如我的访问对于促进这个已经密切的友谊能够有所贡献的话，那就没有任何人比我更高兴的了。
    中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国已经以行动证明，不同意识形态的国家是可以共处的。我希望通过扩大互相了解和互相尊重各自的独立和主权的愿望，共处将逐渐扩大到全世界。这样，这个世界才能够处于和平与安全的环境里。因此，我很希望中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国能够作出比现在更令人信服的榜样，即不同意识形态的国家怎样才能在这个由于科学技术的进步以及各种交通工具的发展而显得狭窄的世界上和平共处。
    现在，当我要离开中国国土的时候，我愿意向邀请我来这里访问的中华人民共和国政府表示感谢，因为这次访问使我能够亲眼看到中国政府和人民所已经共同进行的建设、他们所面临和克服的困难以及他们如何克服这些巨大的困难的办法。如果在这里逐一地叙述我所看到的一切，那是不适当的，因为这一切将要费很多的时间，而且也不可能都讲到。我没有必要向天天都在进行带有困难和缺点的建设的中国人民自己讲这些。我可以说，中国政府和人民在那样短的时期内所进行的改进和建设，经常使人惊讶和惊奇。我看到了中国民族和人民的心里是有变化的，因为如果没有这个心理变化，你们大概不可能那样快地建立工厂、学校和合作社。在这里，我看到你们有纪律、有组织、有责任心和有信心地进行着劳动。我知道还有更多的事业需要你们来作和建设，使全体人民都能享受社会福利。你们需要作的事业是比你们已经建设的还要多得多，但是你们所已经作到的一切，我认为已经足以鼓舞你们，并且使人相信，中国人民已经掌握了自己的未来的命运。
    祝中国人民在建设中安全地取得成就。在这样短促的和不完全的参观中，我向你们学习了许多关于你们的建设方法以及克服困难和改正错误的方法。
    最后，我向你们致敬和告别。
    祝中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国之间的友谊长存！
