Advance Along the Path of Soviet Farmers
Lü Hongbin, National Agricultural Labor Model, Director of Ju County Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative

The 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution is approaching. As we commemorate this great festival, I would like to talk about the warm concern and enormous assistance that I have seen and received from the Soviet people towards us Chinese farmers.

As early as 1952, I went to the Soviet Union with the Chinese Farmers' Visiting Group to study for three months. During this visit, I deeply felt the noble internationalism of the Soviet people and their concern and warmth for us Chinese farmer brothers. In the Soviet Union, we were warmly welcomed and treated like family by Soviet leaders at all levels, collective farm members, and children. The Soviet people did their best to satisfy our requests for anything we wanted to see or understand. In the Second Five-Year Plan Collective Farm of the Russian Republic, the members knew that the best food for us Chinese farmers was dumplings, so they specially made dumplings for us using Chinese methods, making us feel like we were at home. In a collective farm in the Georgian Republic, the children put bright red scarves around my neck and asked me to take them to the Chinese people and children. Although these are small things, I have never forgotten them.

This visit taught me many valuable lessons. For five years, we have been learning and applying these experiences, which have played a significant role in consolidating and improving our cooperative. Take the cooperative's labor remuneration, for example. At the beginning, our cooperative used the method of "fixed points, flexible recording." Every time we finished a day's work, we had to evaluate work points late into the night, often arguing about the evaluation, which affected the cooperative's production and consolidation. At that time, our cooperative only had eight households, but I and the management committee comrades felt that we could hardly cope. In order to help us solve this problem, Comrade Reskin, chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm, gave us a two-day report in the Soviet Union, introducing in detail their farm's experience in labor management. The day after I returned to the cooperative, I studied and applied this experience with the cadres in the cooperative, and implemented the method of "fixed quality, fixed quantity, fixed time" piecework on four kinds of farm work. Through continuous learning and improvement, the labor quota system has now been fully implemented in the cooperative's agricultural and sideline production, greatly encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the members.

After the implementation of the labor quota, not only was the labor remuneration reasonable, but the entire cooperative's labor accounting became more accurate because there was a correct basis. Therefore, we can use labor more flexibly and expand production channels. Our cooperative has more than 4,300 male and female laborers, who can work 500,000 workdays throughout the year. According to the contract quota accounting, agricultural production and basic construction and other labor use a total of 400,000 workdays, and there are still 100,000 workdays that need to be arranged. We learned from the experience of Soviet collective farms in developing diversified production and management, and used the surplus labor to develop 14 relatively large-scale sideline productions such as iron and woodworking, transportation, and kiln industry, and planted a large number of fruit trees and timber trees on more than 1,000 mu of barren mountains. According to our Second Five-Year Plan, by 1962, the number of various fruit trees will reach 10 million, and the number of various trees will be more than 400,000. The income from the mountains and forests will reach 265,130 yuan. So far this year, our cooperative's various sideline productions have made a profit of more than 60,000 yuan, which on the one hand supports agricultural production, and on the other hand subsidizes the lives of the members.

In terms of agricultural cultivation techniques, we learned from the Soviet farmers' experience in close planting and improved land utilization. On the cooperative's 22,000 mu of land, the land utilization rate has increased by about 10%. Close planting has also achieved increased production. Take wheat, for example. Due to close planting, the yield per mu has increased by more than 60 jin. Our cooperative has also vigorously promoted the Maltsev cultivation method, deep plowing and deep digging the land, and achieved greater production increases. This year's 80 mu of deeply plowed wheat land yielded 250 jin per mu, while the same land that was not deeply plowed yielded only more than 120 jin per mu. In the past few years, our cooperative has transformed more than 4,000 mu of land using deep plowing methods, and has carried out water conservancy construction, and the output has been greatly increased. In 1956, the cooperative's output per mu reached 408 jin and 6 liang, an increase of two times compared with the early days of liberation (1944), and an increase of 55 jin per mu compared with 1952.

The hardworking and simple working style of the Soviet collective farm cadres and their close ties with the masses are also models for us to learn from. The chairman of the Soviet Communist Lighthouse Collective Farm spends a certain amount of time every day going deep into the homes of the members to understand their demands and opinions on the farm, which greatly strengthens the relationship between the members and the leaders. The management committee members of our cooperative have also learned his excellent working style. Last year, our cooperative expanded from more than 100 households to more than 1,900 households, and changed from a primary cooperative to an advanced cooperative. The cadres had no experience in leadership work, and there were shortcomings in their work. In addition to paying attention to understanding the opinions of the masses on weekdays, our management committee members organized cadres to conduct three member family visits last year, listened to many valuable opinions from the members, so that our shortcomings could be overcome in time, and the work was improved.

Thanks to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, our cooperative has made great progress in the past few years. At present, there are 2,173 member households, and tractors, grass cutters, and water pumps have been used. The lives of the members have also been greatly improved. In the past, life was about fleeing famine, begging for food, and half a year of food made of chaff and wild vegetables. Now, every family has surplus grain and every household has new clothes. Now, people wear rubber shoes on rainy days, have flashlights for walking at night, and have radios and libraries for rest. The members often say: The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the members are full of confidence and continue to advance bravely along the path of Soviet farmers, striving for greater victories and a more prosperous life.

    沿着苏联农民的道路前进
    全国农业劳动模范莒县爱国农业社社长  吕鸿宾
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念日就要来到了。在纪念这个伟大节日的时候，我想谈一谈我所看到和受到的苏联人民对我们中国农民的热情关怀和巨大的援助。
    还是在1952年的时候，我随着中国农民赴苏参观团去到了苏联，参观学习了三个月。在这次参观当中，我深深的体会到了苏联人民的崇高的国际主义思想和对我们中国农民兄弟的关切和温暖。在苏联，我们受到了苏联的各级负责同志、农庄庄员以及少年儿童的热烈的欢迎和亲如家人的招待。凡是我们要看的要了解的一些东西，苏联人民都尽量的满足了我们的要求。在俄罗斯加盟共和国第二个五年计划集体农庄里，庄员们知道我们中国农民最好的饭是饺子，他们特别用中国方法包了饺子招待我们，使我们就像在自己家里一样。在格鲁吉亚共和国的一个集体农庄，少年儿童们把鲜艳的红领巾戴在我的脖子上，要我把它带给中国人民和少年儿童。这些虽然是些小事情，可是我直到现在一刻也没有忘记。
    这次参观使我学到了很多的宝贵经验。五年来我们学习运用这些经验，对我们合作社的巩固提高起到了很大作用。就拿社的劳动计酬来说吧，我们社在开始的时候是用“死分活记”的办法，每干完一天活，晚上就要评工分到深夜，经常因评工争吵起来，影响了社的生产和巩固。那时候我们社还只有八户，可是我和管理委员同志们就觉着有些应付不了。为了帮助我们解决这个问题，在苏联的时候斯大林集体农庄主席雷斯金同志曾给我们作了两天的报告，详细的介绍了他们农庄劳动管理的经验。我回国到了社里的第二天，就同社内的干部们学习运用了这个经验，在四种农活上实行了“定质、定量、定时”的按件记工办法。在不断地学习改进中，现在全社的农副业生产全部推行了劳动定额制度，大大地鼓舞了社员们的劳动积极性。
    推行了劳动定额以后，不仅劳动报酬合理了，全社的劳动核算因为有了正确的根据也更加准确了。因此，我们可以更加灵活地使用劳动力，可以扩大生产门路。我们全社有男女劳力四千三百余个，全年能出工五十万个。按照包工定额核算，农业生产及基本建设等用工共为四十万个，尚有劳动日十万个需要安排。我们学习了苏联农庄开展多种生产经营的经验，利用剩余劳力开展了铁木业、运输、窑业等十四种较大型的副业生产，并在一千余亩荒山上种植了大量的果树和用材树木。根据我们的第二个五年计划，至1962年，各种果树将达到一千万棵，各种林木四十余万棵，山林的收益可达二十六万五千一百三十元。今年到目前为止，我们社的各项副业生产已获利六万多元，这一方面支援了农业生产，另方面也补助了社员们的生活。
    在农业的耕作技术上，我们学习了苏联农民的密植经验，提高了土地利用率。在全社的二万二千亩土地上，土地利用率提高了10％左右。密植也收到了增产的效果。拿小麦来说，由于密植每亩增产六十余斤。我们社还大力推行马尔采夫耕作法，将土地进行了深翻、深刨，获得了更大的增产。如今年的八十亩深翻地的小麦，每亩产二百五十斤，而同等土地未深翻者，每亩只产一百二十多斤。几年来我们社已经用深翻办法改造了土地四千多亩，并开展了水利建设，产量有了很大提高。1956年全社每亩产量达到四百零八斤六两，比刚解放时（1944年）增加两倍，比1952年每亩增产五十五斤。
    苏联集体农庄干部的艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的工作作风，也是我们学习的榜样。苏联共产主义灯塔集体农庄主席每天都有一定的时间深入庄员家中，了解庄员们的要求和对农庄的意见，这大大地密切了庄员与领导的关系。我们社的管理委员们也学习了他的这种优良的工作作风。去年我们社由百多户扩大到了一千九百多户，由初级社转为高级社，干部在领导工作上没有经验，工作有缺点。我们管理委员们除了平日注意了解群众的意见以外，去年一年中组织干部进行了三次社员家庭访问，听取了社员们许多宝贵意见，使我们的缺点能够及时克服，工作得到改进。
    由于学习了苏联的先进经验，我们社几年来获得了很大发展。目前已有社员二千一百七十三户，已经使用上拖拉机、铡草机、抽水机。社员生活也有了很大改善。过去的生活是逃荒要饭、糠菜半年粮，现在是家家有余粮，户户有新衣。现在下雨天穿着胶鞋，晚上走路有手电筒，休息时有收音机、图书室。社员们常说：苏联的今天就是我们的明天。社员们都信心百倍地在共产党和毛主席的领导下，继续沿着苏联农民的道路奋勇前进，争取更大的胜利和更富裕的生活。　（尹均凯代笔）
