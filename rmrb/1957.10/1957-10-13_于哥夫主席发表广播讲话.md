Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Yugov, at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, delivered a radio address to the Chinese people on the eve of his departure from Beijing. The full text is as follows:

　　Dear brothers and sisters of the People's Republic of China:

　　We are pleased to accept the invitation to talk with you on the radio about our impressions of our visit to the great People's Republic of China, and on behalf of the Bulgarian people, the Bulgarian government, and the Bulgarian Communist Party, to once again extend our warm respects to the Chinese people.

　　During the visit of the delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to China, in addition to Beijing, we also visited Northeast and Southeast China. We went to Changchun, Shenyang, Dalian, Lushun, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and other places. We visited the newly built automobile factory in Changchun, the Dalian Shipyard, machine manufacturing plants, cable factories, and aircraft manufacturing plants. We also visited the magnificent Yangtze River Bridge. We visited the Yinma River Village Agricultural Production Cooperative and the state-owned farm in the suburbs of Dalian. We visited many exhibitions, museums, and historical sites reflecting the Chinese people's thousands of years of culture, their creative genius, and glorious revolutionary traditions. In Beijing, we participated in the grand military parade and procession celebrating the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Our delegation met with representatives of Chinese workers, peasants, intellectuals, youth, Young Pioneers, and held talks with party and state leaders.

　　We particularly strongly felt how the giant heart of our fraternal country, the People's Republic of China, is beating rhythmically, and how the Chinese working people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are industrializing the country, establishing their own strong heavy industry, and transforming agriculture on a socialist basis. We saw the speed with which the productive forces of New China are developing. We saw how a solid technical foundation, as an important condition for the development of the entire national economy of the People's Republic of China, is being established. We saw how the young Chinese working class is growing, how rapidly and tenaciously it is mastering complex modern technology, and how a new generation of working-class intellectuals is emerging from the people.

　　Wherever we went, we saw a peaceful people, full of confidence in the future, forging ahead, overcoming the long-term backwardness left over by the past feudal reactionary forces and foreign rule with astonishing strength, with a deep belief in the bright future of their motherland, and with tenacious labor, step by step. We have come to appreciate the greatness of the profound changes taking place in the People's China today.

　　We have emphasized more than once the enormous superiority of socialism over capitalism. The historic victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the great achievements of the Soviet people in transforming their country into a powerful socialist state under the leadership of the glorious Soviet Communist Party undoubtedly prove this. The Soviet socialist system has brilliantly withstood all storms and tests. This year, people all over the world will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and celebrate the historically significant victory of the Soviet people.

　　In the People's Republic of China, life has also confirmed the superiority of socialism. Under the conditions of New China, the working people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have fundamentally changed the face of their motherland in a short historical period.

　　We know that the Chinese people still need to overcome many difficulties and solve many important tasks. But we are deeply convinced that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people will surely overcome all difficulties and embark on the broad road of socialism, and will surely overcome all difficulties and transform the People's Republic of China into a powerful socialist industrial country. The high political and production enthusiasm of workers, peasants, and intellectuals is a guarantee of this. The Chinese Communist Party, which mobilizes the creative power of the working people and unswervingly struggles to rectify the work style in enterprises, institutions, and agriculture, is a guarantee of this. We have seen how, in the irreconcilable struggle against the rightists and in defense of the fruits of the revolution, the people are strengthening their political and moral unity and uniting closely around the great Chinese Communist Party, which is undoubtedly the main condition for the complete victory of socialism in the People's Republic of China.

　　Both of our countries are peace-loving countries. The people of both our countries have always hoped to live in peace and mutual understanding with all peace-loving countries. The people of both countries resolutely condemn the position of the US imperialist group, their adventurous plans, and the most arrogant provocations, conspiracies, and threats to the freedom and national independence of all countries.

　　We felt the desire for peace of the fraternal Chinese people on every inch of land. The talks we held with the state and party leaders of the People's Republic of China in a particularly cordial and friendly atmosphere demonstrated the consensus and agreement of both sides on all issues of our time, on the solidarity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, on the friendship and cooperation of communist parties and workers' parties of all countries, and on peace and international cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit.

　　Our common great event is: It was not others, but our common friend and ally, the great Soviet Union, who successfully tested the intercontinental missile for the first time in the world and launched the first artificial satellite of the Earth. This is a new victory for the Soviet state and the result of the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

　　The great achievement of mankind in launching the artificial satellite of the Earth has caused panic and confusion among the reactionary groups, and has also aroused the common joy and admiration of the people of all countries and the progressive scientific and ideological circles of the world. This event irrefutably proves the superiority of the Soviet Union in science and technology. This is a great victory for the Soviet Union in the peaceful competition with the United States.

　　Glory and honor to the Soviet scientists, creative geniuses, and scientific workers who have greatly enhanced the reputation of their socialist motherland. They are the representatives of the progress of all mankind in all aspects.

　　These new scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union have forced the braggarts and atomic swindlers to seriously consider and re-examine their bankrupt "policy of strength." The entire development of international events resolutely calls for a policy of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect, non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and broad cooperation between countries with different social systems. There is no doubt that life decisively confirms the great significance of Lenin's principle of peaceful coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.

　　During our visit to China, we saw the deep love of the Chinese people for the Bulgarian people. Our people also have the same love for their Chinese brothers. The friendship between the people of our two countries is indeed deep and unbreakable. They learn from each other in socialist construction and learn from the Soviet elder brother. The economic and cultural cooperation between the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the People's Republic of China is developing day by day. This is clearly reflected in the documents we signed. There is no doubt that the visit of our delegation to China will further strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the people of our two countries.

　　We feel the strong love of the Chinese people for the Soviet Union and their deep gratitude for the sincere and selfless assistance given to the People's Republic of China by the Soviet people in socialist construction. The Chinese people, like the Bulgarian people, cherish the unity of the socialist countries. The people of our two countries stand firmly on the position of proletarian internationalism, uphold the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the ideas of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong's statement that the Chinese People's Revolution is a continuation of the October Socialist Revolution has a profound response in the minds of the broad masses of working people. The ideas of the October Revolution have become a living reality on the vast land of China and have become a huge material force.

　　Let the enemies go crazy, let them hurl malicious slanders and libels against the People's Republic of China and our socialist countries. Our country has a saying: "The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on." Their clamor cannot stop the victorious advance of socialism. The undeniable and great historical fact that the People's Republic of China exists now and will continue to exist, that it is constantly developing, and that its economic and defense forces are growing day by day, not only causes the Chinese people to cheer, but also causes the cheers of our entire socialist camp and all peace-loving countries in the world.

　　We want to once again wholeheartedly wish our fraternal Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party new and greater victories and new achievements in socialist construction, and wish the People's Republic of China prosperity.

　　于哥夫主席发表广播讲话
    新华社12日讯　保加利亚人民共和国部长会议主席于哥夫，在离京前夕，应中央人民广播电台的邀请，向中国人民发表了广播讲话。全文如下：
    亲爱的中华人民共和国的兄弟姐妹们：
    我们高兴地接受了邀请在广播电台同大家谈一谈我们到伟大的中华人民共和国访问的感想，同时代表保加利亚人民、保加利亚政府和保加利亚共产党再一次向中国人民致以热烈的敬意。
    保加利亚人民共和国代表团在中国访问期间，除了北京以外，还访问了中国的东北和东南。我们到了长春、沈阳、大连、旅顺、上海、杭州、广州等地。参观了长春的新建的汽车工厂、大连造船厂、机器制造厂、电缆厂和飞机制造厂等。我们还参观了宏伟的长江大桥。我们访问了饮马河村农业生产合作社和大连近郊的国营农场。参观了许多反映中国人民几千年文化、他们的创造天才和光荣的革命传统的展览会、博物馆和古迹。我们在北京参加了庆祝中华人民共和国建国八周年的盛大的阅兵典礼和游行。我们代表团曾经同中国的工人、农民、知识分子的代表、青年、少先队员们会见，并且同党和国家领导人举行了会谈。
    我们特别强烈地感到我们兄弟之邦——中华人民共和国的巨大心脏在如何有节奏地跳动着，中国劳动人民又是如何在英明的中国共产党的领导下使国家工业化，建立着自己的强大的重工业，在社会主义的基础上改造着农业。我们看到了新中国的生产力正在以怎样的速度发展着。中华人民共和国的作为整个国民经济发展的重要条件的牢固的技术基础，怎样正在建立着。我们看到了年轻的中国工人阶级在怎样成长着，它正在多么迅速地、顽强地掌握着复杂的现代技术，从人民中间产生的新的工人阶级知识分子又是在怎样成长着。
    我们所到之处，到处都看到了安详的人民，他们对明天充满着信心，勇往直前，他们正带着惊人的力量，怀着对祖国光辉未来的深刻信念，以顽强的劳动，一步一步地克服着过去封建反动势力和异族统治遗留下来的长期的落后状态。我们体会到了今天在人民中国进行着的深刻变革的整个伟大性。
    我们曾经不止一次的强调过社会主义比资本主义的巨大优越性。伟大十月社会主义革命的历史性胜利和苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党的领导下，将自己国家变为一个强大的社会主义国家的巨大成就，毫无疑问地证实了这一点。苏联社会主义制度光辉地经受了一切风暴和考验。今年全世界人民将庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年，将庆祝苏联人民具有历史意义的胜利。
    在中华人民共和国，生活也证实了社会主义的优越性。在新中国的条件下，劳动人民才能在中国共产党的领导下，在短短的历史时期内根本改变自己祖国的面貌。
    我们知道，中国人民还需要克服不少困难，还需要解决许多重要的任务。但是我们深信，在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民一定能够克服重重困难，走上宽阔的社会主义大道，一定能够战胜一切困难，把中华人民共和国变为一个强大的社会主义工业国。工人、农民和知识分子的高度政治积极性和生产积极性就是这方面的保证。动员劳动人民的创造力量，始终不渝地为整顿企业、机关和农业中的工作作风进行斗争的中国共产党就是这方面的保证。我们看到在反对右派、保卫革命果实的不调和的斗争中，人民是在怎样的加强政治上和道义上的团结一致，紧紧团结在伟大的中国共产党的周围，这无疑是中华人民共和国社会主义获得全胜的主要条件。
    我们两国都是热爱和平的国家。我们两国人民一向热望同一切爱好和平的国家和平共处，互相谅解。两国人民坚决谴责美帝国主义集团的立场、他们的冒险计划和对各国人民自由、民族独立的最蛮横的挑衅、阴谋和威胁。
    我们在每一寸土地上都感到兄弟中国人民的热爱和平的愿望。我们同中华人民共和国的国家和党的领导人在特别亲切和友好的气氛中进行的会谈中，表现了双方对我们当代一切问题，对以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结、各国共产党、工人党的友谊和合作问题，对和平和在互利的基础上的国际合作问题的思想一致和意见一致。
    我们共同的大喜事是：不是别人，而是我们共同的朋友和同盟者伟大苏联在世界上第一个成功地试验了洲际导弹，放射了地球上第一颗人造卫星。这是苏维埃国家的新胜利，是伟大十月社会主义革命胜利的结果。
    放射地球上的人造卫星这一人类的伟大成就，引起了反动集团的惊慌和混乱，也引起了各国人民和世界进步科学界思想界的共同喜悦和钦佩。这一事件不可辩驳地证明了苏联在科学技术方面的优势。这是苏联同美国在和平竞赛中取得的巨大胜利。
    光荣和荣誉归于苏联科学家，富有创造精神的天才和科学工作者，把自己社会主义祖国的声誉大大提高，他们是全人类在各方面前进的代表。
    苏联的这些科学技术的新成就使自吹自擂的人和原子诈骗者不得不认真考虑并且重新审查自己已经破产了的“实力政策”。国际事件的整个发展坚决要求实行和平共处、互相尊重、不干涉他国内政、不同社会制度国家之间广泛合作的政策。毫无疑问，生活断然地证实了列宁的和平共处的原则和万隆会议的十项原则的重大意义。
    在中国访问期间，我们看到了中国人民对保加利亚人民的深厚热爱。我国人民也对自己的中国兄弟们怀着同样的热爱。我们两国人民的友谊的确是深厚的和牢不可破的。在社会主义建设中他们互相学习，并且向苏联老大哥学习。保加利亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国的经济文化合作日益发展。这在我们签署的文件中都得到明确的反映。毫无疑问，我国代表团到中国的访问将进一步加强我们两国人民之间的友谊和合作。
    我们感到中国人民对苏联的强烈热爱，他们对苏联人民在社会主义建设中所给予中华人民共和国的真诚的、大公无私的援助的深深感激。中国人民像保加利亚人民一样珍视社会主义国家的团结，我们两国人民共同坚定不移地站在无产阶级国际主义的立场，拥护马克思列宁主义的不朽的思想和伟大十月社会主义革命的思想。毛泽东同志关于中国人民革命是十月社会主义革命的继续的说法在广大劳动人民群众的思想中有着深刻的反应。十月革命的思想在中国广阔无边的土地上成为了活生生的事实，成为了巨大的物质力量。
    让敌人疯狂吧，让他们对中华人民共和国和我们社会主义国家抛出恶毒的谰言和诽谤吧。我国有句俗话说：“狗尽管叫，而商队还照样前进”。他们的叫嚣不能阻挡社会主义胜利前进。中华人民共和国现在存在，并且将继续存在，它正在不断发展，它的经济和国防力量日益加强，这一无可辩驳的巨大历史事实不但引起中国人民的欢呼，并且引起我们整个社会主义阵营和世界一切爱好和平国家的欢呼。
    我们要再一次衷心地祝我们兄弟的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党在社会主义建设中取得新的、更大的胜利，获得新的成就，并且祝中华人民共和国繁荣。
