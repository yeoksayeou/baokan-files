Premier Zhou Enlai and other state leaders went to the airport to see off the distinguished guests. Premier Kádár, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the guard of honor.

Premier Zhou delivered a speech to bid farewell to the distinguished guests. He said that the visit of the Hungarian government delegation to China brought the profound fraternal friendship of the Hungarian people to China. He also said that the cordial talks between the leaders of the Chinese and Hungarian governments in Beijing and the joint statement issued by the two governments "once again show that our two governments have reached a consensus on important current international issues, further strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, and developing the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Hungary."

Premier Zhou said: "Dear Premier Comrade, although we are temporarily separated, the common goal of building socialism and safeguarding world peace will forever closely link the hearts of our two peoples. I sincerely ask you to convey the most sincere wishes of the Chinese people to the entire Hungarian people."

Premier Zhou finally wished the heroic Hungarian people with glorious revolutionary traditions, under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, to continue to achieve new and greater achievements in the cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace.

Premier Kádár delivered a farewell speech. He first talked about the talks between the leaders of China and Hungary. He said: "In our talks, we exchanged views on issues of common concern. We introduced each other's situations. We introduced the domestic problems that our two governments and peoples, who are engaged in socialist construction, are currently working to solve. We have reached a consensus on general international issues and issues related to China and Hungary." "Therefore, we want to thank the Chinese state leaders who talked with us and fully understood the cause of the Hungarian people."

Premier Kádár then said: "We feel that this visit to China is a beneficial and effective work for the Hungarian People's Republic and the Hungarian people."

"During the visit, we had the opportunity to visit many places, including state organs, social facilities, industrial enterprises, farms and cultural institutions. Everywhere we saw the spirit of perseverance and discipline, and the great and victorious achievements of labor."

"The firm determination, unity and great will shown by the Chinese masses left us with a particularly deep impression. This great will proves that the Chinese people will surely be able to defeat all attacks from enemies at home and abroad, defend their national independence, and build a socialist society."

Premier Kádár said: "The friendship for the Hungarian people that we have experienced among the broad masses of the Chinese people provides new strength for our work after we return home. After returning home, we will tell the Hungarian people about the tremendous friendship we have felt here, which is constantly increasing."

The Premier finally said: "We assure you that the Hungarian people, in their homeland far from China, will continue to fight alongside the fraternal Chinese people, resolutely for our own and our common cause, for socialism, and for peace."

At the end of their speeches, both premiers shouted: "Long live the eternal brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people!" "Long live the fraternal unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!"
