    Yangtze River Bridge Documentary Film to be Screened Nationwide

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The documentary film of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will be screened across the country.

    This film was produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio.

    The cinematographers arrived in Wuhan as early as October 11th. They will film the Yangtze River Bridge—this world-renowned bridge—into a color news documentary, a black-and-white documentary, and a wide-screen film, to comprehensively introduce the bridge's engineering construction, practical value, artistic architecture, and grand opening, so that people across the country can happily see the First Bridge on the Mighty Yangtze River, just like the people of Wuhan.
