Xinhua News Agency dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on October 1st to elect three non-permanent members of the Security Council. Panama, Canada, and Japan were elected.

Panama was nominated by Latin American countries to replace Cuba's position and received 74 votes in a secret ballot. Canada was nominated by the Commonwealth to replace Australia and received 72 votes. A total of 78 delegations participated in the voting.

Japan's candidacy was put forward by the US, Britain, and other countries in violation of the provisions of the UN Charter and the London Gentlemen's Agreement, resisting the candidacy of Czechoslovakia, which was nominated by the Eastern European People's Democratic countries to fill the seat originally belonging to Eastern Europe. Under the manipulation of Western countries, Japan received 55 votes, three votes more than the necessary two-thirds majority. Twenty-five countries voted for Czechoslovakia.

On the same day, the Soviet delegation issued a statement pointing out that Japan's election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council was a violation of the UN Charter and the London Agreement. The delegation expressed its firm protest against this election, which is an open discrimination against Eastern European countries.

Czechoslovakia's representative to the UN General Assembly, Mr. Ulihe, made a statement on September 30 regarding the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council.

He said that Eastern European countries unanimously nominated Czechoslovakia to obtain the seat in the Security Council belonging to Eastern European countries. However, the United States and Britain, with the support of other Western countries, are violating the UN Charter, which stipulates fair geographical distribution in important UN organs, and the 1946 London Agreement, trying to deprive socialist countries of the right to be elected to the Security Council and other UN bodies, and openly discriminating against these countries. This discrimination will have serious consequences for the prestige of the United Nations and the Security Council, which bears important responsibility for maintaining peace and security.

    联大选举安理会非常任理事国
    美英再次破坏伦敦君子协定
    无理强使日本夺占捷克斯洛伐克席位
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议10月1日选举安全理事会的三个非常任理事国。结果巴拿马、加拿大和日本当选。
    巴拿马是拉丁美洲国家提出递补古巴的位置的，经过秘密投票，它获得了七十四票；加拿大是英联邦提出递补澳大利亚的，它获得了七十二票。一共有七十八个代表团参加投票。
    日本的候选资格是美英等国在违背联合国宪章中规定和破坏伦敦君子协定的情况下提出递补原应属于东欧国家的席位的；它们就这样来抵制东欧人民民主国家所提出的候选国——捷克斯洛伐克。在西方国家操纵下，日本获得五十五票，即比三分之二的必要多数票多三票。投捷克斯洛伐克票的有二十五个国家。
    当天，苏联代表团发表声明指出，日本当选为安理会非常任理事国，是破坏联合国宪章和伦敦协定的。这次选举是对东欧国家公开的歧视，代表团对此表示坚决抗议。
    捷克斯洛伐克出席联合国大会代表乌里赫9月30日就安全理事会非常任理事国选举问题发表谈话。
    他说，东欧国家一致推举捷克斯洛伐克取得安理会中属于东欧国家的这个席位。但是，美国和英国在其他西方国家的支持下，竟然破坏规定联合国重要机构中应作公正的地理分配的联合国宪章，破坏1946年的伦敦协定而想使社会主义阵营国家丧失被选入安理会和联合国其他机构的权利，对这些国家实行公开歧视。这种歧视会给联合国的威信和对维护和平和安全负有重要责任的安理会带来严重的后果。
