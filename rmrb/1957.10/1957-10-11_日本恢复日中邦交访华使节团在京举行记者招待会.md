Xinhua News Agency, October 10th. Kazami Akira, Chairman of the Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, told Chinese and foreign reporters in Beijing today, "No matter what the situation is, we will confidently urge any Japanese government to realize the Japanese people's desire to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China." He also said that as part of the efforts to promote the national movement for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, mass rallies will be held in Tokyo and Osaka in November this year.

Kazami Akira made the remarks at a press conference held after attending the signing ceremony of the joint statement on the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations between the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the visiting delegation of the Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations. He said at the conference that the vast majority of the Japanese people are in favor of restoring normal relations between China and Japan, "Our task is to do our best to achieve this goal." As a member of the Japanese Diet, Kazami Akira also said that the Diet members participating in the national movement for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations will strive to express this wish of the Japanese people in the Diet.

Yoshida Hōsei, the deputy head of the delegation, also said that the delegation included influential members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and members of local legislative bodies, all of whom are working towards this goal. There are also many members of the Liberal Democratic Party who are in favor of restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

When asked about his opinion on the Japanese government's policy towards China, Kazami Akira said that the current Japanese government is following the United States' policy towards Asia, especially the United States' "Two Chinas" policy. It is not easy to change this policy because the United States controls Japan. However, Kazami Akira also pointed out that the Japanese people are increasingly demanding a change in this "Two Chinas" policy because it threatens peace in Asia.

Kazami Akira pointed out that since the appearance of the first artificial satellite, the policy of using military force against other countries is meaningless. This has further strengthened the belief that the United States' "Two Chinas" policy is doomed to failure. The possibility of Japan restoring normal diplomatic relations with China is therefore increasing, and will eventually be realized.

When asked about the issue of exchanging journalists between Japan and China, Kazami Akira replied that he had discussed this issue during his stay in Beijing, "The exchange of journalists is of great importance to enhancing mutual understanding."

　　日本恢复日中邦交访华使节团在京举行记者招待会
    新华社10日讯　日本恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章今天在北京向中外记者说，“不管形势是怎样，我们将满怀信心地促使日本的任何政府实现日本人民的恢复日中两国外交关系的愿望。”他并说，作为促进恢复日中邦交国民运动的努力的一部分，今年11月将在东京和大阪召开群众性的集会。
    风见章在参加中国人民外交学会和日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华使节团关于恢复中日邦交的联合声明的签字仪式后举行了记者招待会，他在会上发表谈话说，日本人民的绝大多数都赞成恢复中日两国的正常关系，“我们的任务是尽最大努力去实现这个目的。”作为日本国会议员的风见章并且说，参加恢复日中邦交国民运动的议员们，将在议会中努力表达出日本人民的这种愿望。
    日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华使节团副团长吉田法晴也说，访华使节团包括了日本执政党——自由民主党的一些有影响的党员和地方立法机构的成员，他们都在为这一目标努力。在自由民主党中也有不少的党员是赞成恢复日本同中国的外交关系的。
    在问到对于日本政府对华政策的意见时，风见章说，日本现政府追随着美国对亚洲的政策，特别是美国的“两个中国”的政策。要改变这个政策不是容易的事，因为美国控制了日本。但是，风见章又指出，日本人民越来越强烈地要求改变这种“两个中国”的政策，因为它威胁亚洲的和平。
    风见章指出，自从第一个人造地球卫星出现以后，用军事力量来对付另一些国家的政策是毫无意义的。这就更加增强了这种信念，就是美国的“两个中国”的政策是注定要失败的。日本同中国恢复正常外交关系的可能性也因之越来越大，并且最后必将实现。
    在问到关于日中两国交换记者的问题时，风见章回答说，他在北京期间曾经谈到这个问题，“交换记者对于增进相互了解具有极大的重要性”。
