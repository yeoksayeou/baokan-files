Friendship on the Banks of the Ergune River
Xinhua News Agency reporter Qin Jilun
    The Ergune River, at the northwest foot of the Greater Khingan Mountains, is a beautiful river winding along the Sino-Soviet border. The sincere friendship between the people of the two countries, who face each other across the river, flows endlessly like this clear and rapid river water. In the mountains and forests, fields and pastures along the Ergune River, inspiring stories of genuine love between the people of the two countries are told everywhere.
    On June 28 this year, Sun Meifang, a young female teacher at a Chinese primary school on the Sino-Soviet border, suddenly suffered from intestinal colic and vomited blood profusely, and then lost consciousness. In this remote border area, with no hospital or doctor, all the teachers and students were panicked and anxious. At this time, our border defense station immediately contacted the Soviet border defense station for help. Upon hearing the news, the Soviet side immediately dispatched two Soviet border defense lieutenant colonels, who drove a jeep to the bank of the Ergune River to receive the patient. Sun Meifang was soon admitted to the Zavozi border defense hospital in the Soviet Union. Here, Soviet doctors used the best medicines to save her from danger. The Soviet comrades were also worried that Sun Meifang would be lonely in her illness due to the language barrier, so they took her child and a Chinese primary school student who could speak Soviet to the river to accompany her. Lieutenant Colonel Vasily Gorabik of the Soviet border defense station, fearing that Sun Meifang would not be accustomed to Soviet food, specially asked his wife to cook Chinese food for Sun Meifang. He also sent a letter to the primary school and the patient's family to report on her condition, so as not to worry them.
    In the Soviet hospital, Sun Meifang, like every Soviet citizen, enjoyed completely free medical care. Her child and the primary school student who acted as her translator also stayed in the hospital with her free of charge. It was not until mid-July, when Sun Meifang had fully recovered, that she was sent back across the river.
    On the Ergune River border line, since September last year, nine of our critically ill patients have received treatment from Soviet comrades. Several times, the female director of the Soviet hospital personally came for emergency treatment. Sometimes Soviet doctors treated and cared for the patients tirelessly all night long.
    Residents on the Ergune River also told the reporter another moving story.
    In May this year, the river ice in the upper reaches of the Ergune River had just begun to thaw, and the surging river water, carrying ice floes, rushed down. Damusu Village, located downstream, has a cold climate. At this time, the river ice had not yet melted, and the ice floes from the upper reaches piled up layer upon layer, creating an ice dam. The river water was blocked and could not flow downstream, so it overflowed onto both banks. Damusu Village, with thirty or forty households on the river bank, was about to be flooded. At this critical moment, the Soviet Union sent an airplane to blow up the ice dam, and the river water flowed smoothly downstream. Damusu Village was then saved from danger.
    Similar incidents have happened more than once here. Last summer, when the flood overflowing from the Ergune River surrounded Wuchiluofu Village, where Mongolian, Ewenki, Hui, and Han people lived together, it was also the Soviet border defense station on the opposite bank that sent personnel and boats to rescue the residents and property of the village.

    额尔古纳河畔的友谊新华社记者　秦继仑
    大兴安岭西北麓的额尔古纳河，是蜿蜒在中苏边界上的一条美丽的河流。隔河相望的两国人民的真挚的友谊，就像这清澈湍急的河水一样，长流不息。在额尔古纳河畔的山林中，和田野牧场里，到处传颂着两国人民真诚相爱的激动人心的故事。
    今年6月28日，中苏边境线上一个中国小学的年轻女教师孙梅芳突然胃肠绞痛，大口吐血，随即失去了知觉。在这偏僻的边陲地带，既无医院又无医生，全校师生都惊慌失措，焦虑万分。这时候我国边防站随即向苏联边防站联系求救。苏联方面闻讯后，立刻派出两位苏联边防中校，开来一辆吉普车到额尔古纳河畔来迎接病人。孙梅芳很快住进了苏联的扎沃兹边防医院。在这里，苏联医生用最好的药品，把她从危亡中拯救过来。苏联同志还担心孙梅芳因语言不通，病中寂寞把她的孩子和一个会说苏联话的中国小学生，接过河去陪伴着她。苏联边防站瓦西力·哥拉比克中校，怕孙梅芳不习惯苏联的饭食，特别让自己的妻子给孙梅芳做中国饭吃。并捎信给小学校和病人的家庭，报告病情，以免他们挂念。
    孙梅芳在苏联医院里，像每个苏联公民一样，享受着全部的免费医疗。她的孩子和给她作翻译的小学生，也和她一起免费住在医院里。直到7月中旬孙梅芳身体全复原了，才被送过河来。
    在额尔古纳河国境线上，从去年9月到现在，已经有九个我国急病病人，得到苏联同志的救治。有好几次，苏联医院的女院长亲自前来急诊。有时苏联医生彻夜不息地治疗和护理着病人。
    额尔古纳河上的居民还向记者说了另外一件动人的事情。
    今年5月，额尔古纳河上游河冰初解，暴涨的河水夹带着冰块汹涌而下。位于下游的达木苏村气候寒冷，这时河冰尚未融化，上游涌下的冰块，到了这里，层层叠起，造成了冰坝，河水被阻不能下泄，于是，向两岸漫溢。在河边上的这个三、四十户人家的达木苏村，眼看就要被洪水淹没。正在这个紧急关头，苏联派来飞机炸碎了冰坝，河水顺利下泄。达木苏村才脱离了险境。
    类似这样的事情在这儿也不止这一桩了，去年夏天当额尔古纳河溢出的洪水包围了蒙古、鄂温克和回、汉等族人民共同居住的乌启罗夫村的时候，也是对岸苏联边防站派来了人员、船只抢救了这个村的居民和财产。
