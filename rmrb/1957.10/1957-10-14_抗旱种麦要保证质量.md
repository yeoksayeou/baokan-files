    Ensure Quality in Drought-Resistant Wheat Planting

    On October 9th, the Anhui Daily published an editorial titled "Ensure Quality in Drought-Resistant Wheat Planting," excerpts of which are as follows:

    The current drought-resistant wheat planting campaign is characterized by tight deadlines, severe drought, and arduous tasks. The lack of manpower, animal power, water sources, and tools exists to varying degrees in different regions, which presents challenges to this campaign. Faced with these numerous difficulties, some comrades may adopt a purely task-oriented view, focusing solely on meeting deadlines and carelessly scattering seeds on the ground, believing that they have "completed the task." This attitude and approach are extremely harmful. Let us consider, what is the purpose of expending so much manpower and resources on drought resistance and emergency planting? Is it not to sow wheat without missing the season? And what is the purpose of timely sowing? Is it not to increase grain production? If we only focus on meeting deadlines and disregard the quality of planting, seemingly "completing the task" on the surface, but the seedlings fail to emerge or emerge unevenly in the future, how can we increase grain production? If we fail to achieve the goal of increasing grain production, then what is the significance of our current drought-resistant wheat planting? Therefore, all regions must particularly prevent sloppy practices in drought-resistant wheat planting and ensure the quality of sowing.

    What are the standards for sowing quality? The minimum requirement is to achieve full and robust seedlings. To ensure full and robust seedlings, a series of tasks from plowing to sowing must be done meticulously and thoughtfully. The land must be plowed deeply, harrowed finely, and harrowed evenly, without large clods, otherwise the seedlings will not be able to take root after emergence, and the young seedlings will wither. Sufficient base fertilizer must be applied to ensure that the seedlings have adequate nutrients during development. Fertilizers cannot be neglected simply because drought resistance is urgent. Because of the drought, seedling emergence may be uneven, and the sowing rate should be increased appropriately to ensure rational close planting. (Attached picture)

    Henan Province is carrying out an intense struggle against drought and for wheat planting. The Baisha Reservoir began releasing water on September 17th, supplying water to the irrigated areas day and night for emergency wheat planting. This is the South Main Canal of the Baisha Irrigation Canal.

### 抗旱种麦要保证质量

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    抗旱种麦要保证质量
    10月9日安徽日报以“抗旱种麦要保证质量”为题，发表社论，摘要如下：
    时间紧、旱情重，任务艰巨，是当前抗旱种麦运动的特点。人力、畜力、水源、工具缺乏的现象，在各地都不同程度的存在着，是这个运动的困难。在这种困难多的情况下，有的同志可能会抱着单纯任务观点，只顾赶时间，马马虎虎把种子抛下地就以为是“完成任务”了。这种态度和做法是非常有害的。我们想想，花这么大的人力物力抗旱抢种为的是什么？还不是为的把麦子不误季节地播种下去。适时播种又为的是什么？还不是为的增产粮食。如果我们只顾赶时间，不顾播种质量，表面上看好像是“完成了任务”，将来不出苗，或者出苗不齐，又怎么能够增产粮食呢？假如达不到增产粮食的目的，那末，我们现在抗旱种麦又有什么意义呢？所以，各地特别要防止抗旱种麦工作中的粗糙现象，保证播种的质量。
    什么是播种质量的标准呢？它的最起码的要求，就是要做到苗全苗壮。为了保证苗全苗壮，就必须从耕种到播种，一系列的工作都要做得细致周到。地要耕得深，耙得细，耙得匀，不要有大坷垃，不然种子出苗以后扎不下根，幼苗就要枯死。基肥要上足，才能保证幼苗在发育期间有充足的养分。不能因为抗旱很紧，就不施肥料。因为天旱，出苗可能不齐，应当适当增加播种量，保证合理密植。（附图片）
    河南省各地开展了紧张的抗旱种麦斗争。白沙水库于9月17日起就开闸放水，日夜不停地供应灌区抢种小麦。这是白沙灌溉渠的南干渠。
