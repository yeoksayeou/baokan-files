The Third National Congress of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles was originally scheduled to be held in October this year. Now, because the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle are being carried out in depth throughout the country, the struggle tasks of various literary and art organizations are relatively heavy. It has recently been decided to postpone the conference to next year; the specific date will be determined after a meeting of the Presidium is held later.

    全国第三次文代大会延至明年举行
    中国文学艺术界联合会第三次全国代表大会曾决定于今年10月间召开。现在因为整风和反右派斗争正在全国深入开展，各文艺团体的斗争任务比较繁重。最近决定将大会延到明年举行；具体会期，俟以后举行主席团会议再行确定。
