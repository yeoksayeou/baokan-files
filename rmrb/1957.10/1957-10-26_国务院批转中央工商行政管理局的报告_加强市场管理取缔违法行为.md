Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: The State Council recently approved and transmitted the Central Administration of Industry and Commerce's report on several issues concerning current urban market management, requesting local People's Committees to strengthen the management of urban markets.

The report by the Central Administration of Industry and Commerce, after analyzing the current situation of urban markets, put forward the following key suggestions for strengthening and improving urban market management:

	(1) All regions must strictly implement the classified management of commodities. When staff members of various enterprises go out to purchase goods, they should hold a certificate or letter of introduction from their unit, and be allowed to purchase only after obtaining local permission, and should earnestly obey the leadership and regulations of the local market management department.

	Existing unlicensed vendors should be cleaned up and rectified while strengthening economic leadership. Those who have formal household registration in the city, genuinely rely on business to maintain their livelihoods, and have no problems with their sources of goods can generally be registered and issued licenses, allowing them to continue operating. Family members who do not rely on business to maintain their livelihoods should generally be persuaded to stop operating. Small owners, private individuals in joint state-private enterprises or other employed personnel who participate in individual commercial activities by joining supply and marketing cooperatives or cooperative stores should be criticized and stopped. Farmers who flow into the city to do business should be resolutely mobilized to return to their hometowns to engage in production. Speculative and illegal elements who consistently engage in reselling at a profit must be sanctioned. Organized small vendors and those allowed to continue operating should also be appropriately controlled in terms of their business scope, operating areas, and profit income, and attention should be paid to strengthening their education, management, and transformation.

	(2) For self-initiated industrial households, the management of opening and closing businesses must be strengthened, and existing unlicensed households must be cleaned up and registered separately. Those with relatively few problems with raw materials and product sales, and with certain production technology and equipment, should in principle be registered and issued licenses. Those whose production technology and equipment conditions are very poor, whose products are extremely inferior, or who have great difficulties in selling raw materials and products, can be mobilized to stop production and not be issued business licenses. Private individuals in joint state-private enterprises and small owners who have joined handicraft production cooperatives, who privately establish factories and workshops and poach employed workers, must be criticized and resolutely stopped, and those whose circumstances are serious and egregious should be punished according to law. For industrial households allowed to continue production, the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation should be implemented. Relevant industrial and commercial departments and industrial and commercial administration departments should establish processing, ordering, or purchasing and sales relationships with them as needed and as possible, and strengthen their management, supervision, and education and transformation work, without rushing to implement joint state-private ownership or cooperation with them.

	(3) The main task of agent firms and centralized trading markets is to assist state-owned and supply and marketing cooperative commerce to expand material exchange, regulate supply and demand, and stabilize prices. Therefore, all their work must proceed from facilitating legitimate farmer trade and merchant purchase and sales activities. They should not only provide thorough service and simple procedures, but also try to keep fees low.

	(4) Currently, the main speculative and illegal activities in the market are: illegally trafficking materials that are subject to state-planned purchase or unified purchase; using improper means to rush to purchase goods in the market, or purchasing goods that are relatively scarce in the market from state-owned, joint state-private enterprises, and supply and marketing cooperatives retail units; selling goods that are required to be sold at state-set prices and negotiated prices at prices exceeding the state-set prices and negotiated prices, or using other disguised methods to raise prices; buying and selling short in the market, falsely claiming to introduce transactions to profit from price differences or extort illegal commissions; hoarding and refusing to sell goods that are in short supply in the market; evading taxes; producing substandard goods and deliberately reducing product quality; and adulterating goods when selling them, giving short weight, substituting inferior goods for good goods, substituting fake goods for genuine goods, or selling deteriorated food and medicine, harming people's health, etc. For the above-mentioned speculative and illegal activities, the principle of persuasion and education should be the main focus, with punishment as a supplementary measure, and they should be dealt with seriously according to the severity of the circumstances. In specific handling, distinctions should be made based on different situations, such as general commodities versus commodities subject to planned purchase and unified purchase, first-time offenders versus repeat offenders, farmers engaged in occasional business versus merchants engaged in consistent speculation, and the degree of harm to the market and consumers. Punishments such as warnings, confessions, purchasing goods at par or ordering them to sell their goods at par, confiscating part or all of their goods, fines, and revocation of business licenses may be imposed. In addition, for staff members of state-owned, cooperative, joint state-private enterprises and institutions and organizations who engage in speculative and illegal activities in the market, in addition to the above-mentioned handling methods, their superiors can also give them or their organizations criticism, education, or administrative sanctions.

All market speculative and illegal activities shall be handled by local market management departments. For those who resist administrative handling or whose circumstances are particularly serious and egregious, disrupt the national economic order, and cause great harm to the national economy and the people's livelihood, the market authorities should contact the procuratorial departments to file a lawsuit and send it to the local People's Court for punishment according to law. All regions should, in accordance with the above spirit and in light of local conditions, study and formulate specific measures to crack down on market speculative and illegal activities, and make appropriate provisions for the handling authority, and pay attention to preventing bad phenomena such as random confiscation and random fines.

    国务院批转中央工商行政管理局的报告
    加强市场管理取缔违法行为
    新华社25日讯　国务院在最近批转了中央工商行政管理局关于当前城市市场管理工作若干问题的报告，要求各地人民委员会加强对城市市场的管理。
    中央工商行政管理局的报告，在分析了当前城市市场的情况以后，对加强和改进城市市场的管理工作提出了意见，要点如下：
      （一）各地必须严格执行商品的分类管理。各个企业单位的工作人员在外出采购商品时，应持有本单位的证明或介绍信，经当地许可后方准采购，并应切实服从当地市场管理部门的领导和规定。
    对现有的无证商贩，应在加强经济领导的同时，进行清理整顿。对在城市中有正式户口、确实依靠经营商贩维持生活、货源又没有问题的，一般可以进行登记发证，准许他们继续经营；对不依靠经营商贩维持生活的家属，一般应说服教育他们停止经营；对于从事个人商业活动的参加了供销社或合作商店的小业主、公私合营企业的私方人员或者其他在职人员，要加以批评、制止；对流入城市经商的农民，应该坚决动员他们回乡生产；对一贯倒买倒卖的投机违法分子，必须予以制裁。对于已经组织起来的和上述准许继续经营的小商贩，也要在业务范围、经营地区和他们的利润收入等方面加以适当掌握，并应注意加强对他们的教育、管理和改造工作。
      （二）对于自发工业户，必须加强开业歇业的管理，并要对现有无照户分别进行清理登记。对原料和产品销路问题不大、有一定生产技术和设备的，原则上应该进行登记发照；对生产技术、设备条件很差，产品十分低劣、或原料和产品销路困难很大的，可以动员他们停止生产，不发给营业执照；对于私设工厂、作坊、挖雇在业工人的公私合营企业的私方人员和已参加手工业生产合作社的小业主，必须进行批判并坚决制止，其中情节严重恶劣的并应依法惩办。对于准许继续生产的工业户，要贯彻利用、限制、改造的政策，有关的工商业务部门和工商行政部门应该根据需要和可能，同他们建立加工订货或购销关系，并加强对他们的管理、监督和教育改造工作，不必急于对他们实行公私合营或者合作化。
      （三）代理行栈、集中交易市场的主要任务，在于协助国营和供销社商业扩大物资交流，调节供求，稳定物价。因此，它们的一切工作，都要从便利正当的农民贸易和客商的购销活动出发，不仅要服务周到，手续简便，而且要尽量做到取费低廉。
      （四）目前市场上的投机违法行为主要是：非法贩运国家计划收购、统一收购的物资；以不正当手段在市场上抢购，或者向国营、公私合营企业和供销合作社等零售单位套购市场上比较缺少的商品；对规定必须按照国营牌价和议价出售的商品，以超过牌价和议价的价格出售，或者采用其他变相办法哄抬价格；在市场中买空卖空，假借介绍交易从中吃价瞒价、或者勒索非法佣金；对市场供不应求的商品囤积拒售；偷税漏税；粗制滥造，故意降低产品质量；以及出售商品时掺杂使假，少给分量，以次充好，以伪充真或者出售变质食品、药品，损害人民健康等等。对于上述投机违法行为，应本着说服教育为主、处罚为辅的方针，分别情节轻重，严肃地加以处理。在具体处理时，要根据一般商品与计划收购和统一收购商品、初犯与屡犯、偶一经营的农民和一贯投机的商贩、对市场和消费者的危害程度的轻重等等不同情况，加以区别。可以分别给予警告、悔过、平价收购或者责令平价出售其商品、没收其商品的一部或全部、罚款及吊销营业执照等处分。另外，对国营、合作社、公私合营等企业单位及机关、团体的工作人员在市场上进行投机违法活动的，除适用上述处理办法外，并可通过其上级领导机关给其本人或所在机构以批评教育或行政处分。
    凡属市场投机违法行为，应由各地市场管理部门负责处理。对于抗拒行政处理或者情节特别严重恶劣、破坏国家经济秩序、对国计民生危害较大的，市场主管部门应联系检察部门起诉，送请当地人民法院依法惩处。各地应根据以上精神，结合当地情况，研究制定取缔市场投机违法行为的具体办法，对处理权限也要一并作出适当规定，并注意防止乱没收、乱罚款的不良现象。
