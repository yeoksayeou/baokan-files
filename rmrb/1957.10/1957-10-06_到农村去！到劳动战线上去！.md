    Go to the Countryside! Go to the Labor Front!
    Recently, Beijing has transferred, and will continue to transfer, a large number of cadres to participate in rural labor and grassroots work. A surge of enthusiasm has formed among staff in many government offices. Their slogan is: Go to the countryside, go to the grassroots, go to the labor front! Train yourselves, build a new countryside!
    This is a major achievement of the rectification movement. All levels of Party and government organs across the country, from the central to the county level, should do the same.
    Transferring large numbers of cadres to the labor front is a prerequisite for state organs to avoid the accumulation of cadres and improve work efficiency. At present, the management structures of many organs, enterprises, and institutions in our country are large, with too many levels, and people are idling. Not only does this phenomenon exist at the central and provincial/municipal levels, but also at the county level. Too many institutions and too many personnel inevitably waste human and material resources, reduce work efficiency, and foster bureaucracy. The harms are well known. Many organs have long decided to transfer a large number of staff to the countryside and the grassroots. This year, considerable progress has been made in many places through layer-by-layer transfers, with approximately 200,000 staff transferred to the grassroots and approximately 100,000 staff transferred to production posts. However, in general, this is still far from enough. In particular, staff from higher-level organs have rarely returned directly to productive labor.
    Now, Beijing has decided to transfer 30%-50% of its administrative and enterprise management personnel to the countryside, construction sites, and other labor fronts. This opens up the correct path to strengthen the labor front and strengthen the work in rural areas and at the grassroots. Among these cadres, many originally came from rural areas and the grassroots, and returning to the rural areas and the grassroots is appropriate because they are familiar with the work; in addition, there is a portion of young intellectuals who have not worked or been trained in rural areas and at the grassroots, and it is especially necessary to send them to the rural areas and the grassroots for training and transformation through labor.
    It is necessary to transfer a large number of staff from high-level organs directly to the countryside and the labor front in order to thoroughly overcome the top-heavy phenomenon of state organs and other management organs and to greatly advance our struggle against bureaucracy. We are not anarchists; we believe that certain authoritative management organs are necessary. However, if management organs are too large, this not only wastes human and material resources, turning many productive forces into consuming forces, but also inevitably leads to bureaucracy and subjectivism. Because of staff expansion and overlapping levels, many energetic staff in some organs are confined to their offices year after year, with nothing to do, or creating things to do where there is nothing to do. Some organs entrust important tasks to young intellectuals who lack practical experience, which is harmful to the work – making it impossible to solve many urgent problems in a timely, correct, and effective manner; harmful to these young intellectuals – depriving them of the opportunity to train at the lower levels and fostering empty and arrogant bad habits; and harmful to the leaders of these organs – trapping them in a sea of administrative affairs, paperwork, and meetings, even making them dependent on their subordinates and secretaries in everything, too lazy to do things themselves, too lazy to go deep into the lower levels and into the actual lives of the masses. Therefore, transferring the excess staff of management organs to the labor front is, in a certain sense, a liberation of productive forces.
    Our country is a socialist country where the working people are the masters. The revolutionary class nature of our country requires that the staff of state organs – as well as the staff of Party and people's organizations and the management personnel of production enterprises – generally come from the working people and maintain the closest possible ties with them. In the future, all newly promoted staff, even if they cannot all be from working-class families, must at least have experienced a certain period of productive labor, primarily physical labor, and have served in grassroots work. For young intellectuals in state organs at all levels who have not undergone productive labor and grassroots work training, participating in rural labor and grassroots work is an indispensable "make-up class." These young cadres are generally active in their work, but most of them go from home to school, from school to government office, without any physical labor, unable to distinguish the five grains, lacking understanding of actual life, and lacking contact with the workers and peasants. It is impossible to build socialism well by relying on such staff. They should participate in productive labor, become farmers and workers, and undergo several years of training. In this way, they will strengthen their labor and mass perspectives, understand the basic processes of production, understand the lives, thoughts, and emotions of the working people, recognize the wisdom and strength of the masses, and establish close ties with the masses. Only in this way can they truly stand on the side of the working people, learn to consider problems from the actual conditions of the masses, and solve problems according to the mass line working methods.
    Our country is a socialist country where the working people are the masters, it requires not only that our staff come from the working people but also that they be able to return to the working people at any time. The absurd idea that one can only be detached from production, not return to production, can only be an "official," and not "serve the people" cannot be allowed to run rampant among our state staff. When society has a certain need, some of our workers leave their productive labor posts to come to state organs; and when society has another need, when there is a need to reduce state organs and strengthen the labor front, or when some people cannot give full play to their role in state organs, they gladly return to the labor post – this is the normal manifestation of democratic life in a socialist country. Therefore, not only should young intellectuals who have not undergone productive labor and grassroots work training go to the labor front to make up for their deficiencies, but even staff who originally came from the working people should, when the state deems it necessary to return to the labor front, return to the labor post without hesitation. There is nothing dishonorable about this; on the contrary, this is the glory of the working people. It is a great disgrace to be unwilling to return to the labor post.
    Sending large numbers of cadres to participate in productive labor and grassroots work is of great significance for improving and strengthening all aspects of work and for the training of the cadres themselves. The problem is that ideological mobilization and specific arrangements must be made for the transferred cadres so that they can smoothly labor and live in the countryside, factories, and grassroots for a long time. Judging from Beijing's experience, the vast majority of cadres have a positive attitude after undergoing ideological mobilization. Many people signed up enthusiastically and strove to be among the first batch to go to the countryside after hearing the news of the transfer; some people were not approved due to work needs and repeatedly requested approval. However, some comrades were unable to make a decision because they did not have a clear or correct understanding. For example, some people disliked the dirtiness of the countryside, feared the hardship of rural life, or feared that long-term labor would not have a "future," and so on. These ideological problems must be effectively resolved in the original organs. In order to do a good job of ideological work, the leading personnel of each unit must personally talk to the cadres, understand their understanding of participating in productive labor, understand their difficulties, and study with them how to overcome these difficulties. After such careful investigation and research by various organs in Beijing, the problem of transferring cadres has generally been appropriately resolved. Some cadres originally only thought of factories and were unwilling to go to the countryside, but after persuasion, they said: "I am happy to go anywhere. I have not experienced the bloodshed of the past, so what does a little sweat matter now!"
    Six-fifths of our country's population lives in the countryside. In order to build socialism, while giving priority to the development of heavy industry and gradually realizing national industrialization, we must use great strength to build the countryside, otherwise there will be no socialist New China. The experience of the First Five-Year Plan fully proves the necessity of vigorously developing agricultural production and proves that the view of being obsessed with cities while belittling the countryside, farmers, agricultural production, and agricultural labor is completely wrong and extremely shameful. The majority of the transferred cadres should go to the countryside and participate in the great construction of the socialist New Countryside. According to the goals set by the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956 to 1967, we must achieve a huge increase in the production of grain, cotton, and other important crops within twelve years, gradually modernize agricultural production, and, on this basis, greatly improve the material and cultural lives of more than 500 million farmers. To achieve this grand plan, we must rely on the strength of the farmers themselves and also on the support of the cities and industry. The transferred cadres are part of the force that cities support the countryside. Of course, in order to help the construction of the countryside, we must unconditionally put down the airs of "city people," humbly and diligently learn from the farmers, especially from the rural cadres. We hope that all cadres and young people who go to the countryside will enthusiastically participate in the great army of agricultural labor, share the same breath and destiny with the peasant masses, resolutely overcome any difficulties, and contribute all their strength to the construction of the socialist New Countryside.

### 到农村去！到劳动战线上去！

    到农村去！到劳动战线上去！
    北京市最近抽调了并且要继续抽调大批干部参加农村劳动和基层工作。在许多机关的工作人员中形成一种热潮。他们的口号是：到农村去，到基层去，到劳动战线上去！锻炼自己，建设新农村！
    这是整风运动的一个重大收获。全国各级党政机关，从中央到县，都应该这样作。
    大批干部下放到劳动战线上去，是国家机关避免干部积压、提高工作效率的先决条件。目前我国许多机关和企业、事业的管理机构组织庞大，层次过多，人浮于事。不但中央一级和省市一级有这种现象，连县一级也有这种现象。机构多了，人员多了，这当然要浪费人力物力，减低工作效率，助长官僚主义，弊害是人所共知的。很多机关早已决定要大量抽调工作人员到农村和基层去。在今年，许多地方用层层下放的办法作出了相当成绩，全国约有二十万工作人员下放到基层，约有十万工作人员下放到生产岗位。但是总的说来，这些还是很不够的。特别是较高级机关的工作人员，还很少直接回到生产劳动中去。
    现在北京市决定从行政管理人员和企业管理人员中抽调30％—50％到农村、工地等劳动战线上去。这就为加强劳动战线、加强农村和基层的工作开展了正确的道路。在这些干部当中，有许多原先就是从农村和基层来的，现在回到农村和基层去，驾轻就熟，固然是适当的；另外有一部分是没有劳动过、没有经过农村和基层锻炼的青年知识分子，把他们放到农村和基层去，在劳动中锻炼和改造，尤其是十分必要的。
    必须大量抽调高级机关的工作人员，直接下放到农村去，到劳动战线上去，才能够彻底克服国家机关和其他管理机关的头重脚轻的现象，才能够把我们的反官僚主义的斗争大大推进一步。我们不是无政府主义者，我们认为一定的有威权的管理机关是必要的。但是管理机关如果过于庞大，这就不但浪费人力物力，把许多生产的力量变为消费的力量，而且不可避免地产生官僚主义和主观主义。不少机关由于人员膨胀，层次重叠，以至使许多生气勃勃的工作人员长年累月地关在办公室里，无事可做，或者无事找事做。还有些机关把重要工作委托给缺乏实际经验的青年知识分子担任，这样既有害于工作——使工作中的许多迫切问题得不到及时的、正确的、有效的解决；又有害于这些青年知识分子——使他们失去了在下层锻炼的机会，而滋长了空洞、傲慢的恶习；又有害于这些机关的领导者——使他们陷于机关事务、文牍和会议的海洋中，甚至使他们事事依赖下级，依赖秘书，而懒得亲自动手，懒得深入下层，深入群众的实际生活。因此，把管理机关的过多的工作人员下放到劳动战线上去，在一定的意义上说来，乃是一种生产力的解放。
    我们的国家是劳动人民当家作主的社会主义国家。我们国家的这种革命的阶级的性质，要求国家机关工作人员——党和人民团体的工作人员以及生产企业的管理人员当然也一样——一般地是从劳动人民中间来的，能同劳动人民保持最密切的联系。在今后，一切新提拔的工作人员即使还不能都是劳动人民家庭出身，至少也必须都经历过一定时间的生产劳动，首先是体力劳动，并且担任过基层工作。对于目前各级国家机关中没有经过生产劳动和基层工作锻炼的青年知识分子来说，参加农村劳动和基层工作是必不可少的“补课”。这些青年干部一般是积极工作的，但是他们中间的大多数，从家门到学校门，从学校门到了机关大门，四体不勤，五谷不分，对实际生活缺乏了解，同工农群众缺乏联系。依靠这样的工作人员是不能建设好社会主义的。应该让他们参加生产劳动，当农民，当工人，经过几年的锻炼。这样，他们增强了劳动观点和群众观点，懂得了生产的基本过程，了解了劳动人民的生活、思想和情感，认识了群众的智慧和力量，同群众建立了密切的联系，这样，他们才能够真正站在劳动人民的立场，学会从群众的实际状况出发考虑问题，按照群众路线的工作方法解决问题。
    我们的国家既是劳动人民当家作主的社会主义国家，它就不仅要求我们的工作人员从劳动人民中间来，而且要求他们在任何时候都能够仍然回到劳动人民中间去。在我们的国家工作人员中，不能允许那种只能脱离生产、不能回到生产，只能“为官”、不能“为民”的荒谬思想作怪。当社会有某种需要的时候，我们的一部分劳动者离开了生产劳动的岗位来到国家机关；而当社会有另一种需要的时候，当需要缩减国家机关加强劳动战线的时候，或者当某些人在国家机关不能充分发挥作用的时候，他们又欣然回到劳动的岗位——这才是社会主义国家的民主生活的正常表现。因此，不但没有经过生产劳动和基层工作锻炼的青年知识分子应该到劳动战线上去补课，就是本来从劳动人民中间来的工作人员，在国家认为需要回到劳动战线上去的时候，也应该毫不踌躇，回到劳动岗位，不但没有任何不光荣，恰恰相反，这才是劳动人民的光荣，而不愿意回到劳动岗位，这才是很大的不光荣。
    下放大批干部参加生产劳动，参加基层工作，对改进和加强各方面的工作，对干部本身的锻炼，都有很大的意义。问题是对于下放的干部要作好思想的动员，作好具体的安排，使他们能够顺利地长时期地劳动和生活在农村、工厂、基层。从北京市的经验看来，绝大多数干部在经过思想动员以后，态度是积极的。许多人听到下放的消息之后，踊跃报名，争取第一批下乡；有些人由于工作需要没有批准，还再三请求批准。但是也有些同志因为认识不大清楚，或者不正确，下不了决心。例如有人嫌农村脏，怕农村生活苦，或者怕长期劳动没有“前途”，等等。对于这些思想问题，必须在原机关切实解决。为了作好思想工作，各单位的领导人员必须亲自找干部谈话，了解他们对参加生产劳动的认识，了解他们的困难，并且同他们一起研究如何克服这些困难。北京市各机关经过这样细致的调查研究，下放干部的问题一般都得到了适当的解决。有的干部原来只想到工厂，不愿到农村，经过说服以后就表示：“让我到那里去，我都很高兴。我过去没有经过流血斗争，现在流点汗算什么！”
    我国的六分之五的人口在农村。为了建成社会主义，在优先发展重工业，逐步实现国家工业化的同时，必须用极大的力量建设农村，否则就不会有社会主义的新中国。第一个五年计划的经验，充分证明了大力发展农业生产的必要，证明了那种醉心城市而轻视农村、轻视农民、轻视农业生产和农业劳动的观点是完全错误和十分可耻的。下放干部的大部分要到农村，参加社会主义新农村的伟大建设事业。按照1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要所规定的目标，我们要在十二年内使粮食、棉花和其他重要农作物的生产有巨大的增长，使农业生产逐步现代化，在这样的基础上，使五亿以上的农民的物质生活和文化生活大大提高。为了实现这个宏伟的计划，要依靠农民自己的力量，也要依靠城市和工业的支援。下放的干部就是城市支援农村的力量的一部分。当然，为了帮助农村的建设，必须无条件地放下“城里人”的架子，虚心地、刻苦地向农民学习，特别是向农村干部学习。我们希望一切到农村去的干部和青年热情地参加到农业劳动的大军中去，同农民群众同呼吸共甘苦，坚决战胜任何困难，为建设社会主义的新农村而贡献自己的全部力量。
