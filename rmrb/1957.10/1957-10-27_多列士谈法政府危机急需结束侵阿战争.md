Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 26th: TASS reported from Paris: On the evening of the 24th, a mass rally of working people organized by the Central Committee of the French Communist Party was held in Paris. Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, and Jacques Duclos, Chairman of the French Communist Party's parliamentary group, delivered speeches at the meeting.

Thorez began his speech by recounting the collapse of the Bourges-Maunoury government due to the Algerian question, and emphasized the urgent need to end the Algerian war.

He said that only the formation of a government relying on the left-wing majority elected in 1956 could resolve this crisis, but Mollet hoped to compromise with the right wing, which would be beneficial to the reactionaries and detrimental to the working class and the entire country. For the Communists, there is another compromise—a compromise with the left wing, a compromise beneficial to the people.

    多列士谈法政府危机急需结束侵阿战争
    据新华社26日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：24日晚间在巴黎举行了由法国共产党中央委员会组织的劳动人民群众大会。法共中央总书记多列士和法共议会党团主席杜克洛在会上发表了演说。
    多列士在演说开头追述了布歇—莫努里政府因阿尔及利亚问题而垮台的事实，并且强调指出现在迫切需要结束阿尔及利亚战争。
    他说，只有成立依靠1956年选出的左翼多数的政府，才能解决这个危机，但是摩勒指望同右翼进行有利于反动派，不利于工人阶级和整个国家的妥协。对于共产党人来说，存在着另一种妥协——同左翼的妥协，有利于人民的妥协。
