Ode to October

    I saw the Soviet satellite flying forward...
    Zhu Ziqi
    In these exciting days and nights, that beautiful little moon often revolves and flies in my heart and dreams. On the morning of October 10th, the little moon swept across the sky over Beijing. I carried my telescope and climbed onto the roof with my comrades to watch it and welcome it. I saw the Soviet satellite flying forward. I saw it, I saw it, the Soviet satellite flying forward excitedly! I saw the satellite singing and flying forward bathed in the golden dawn! I saw the satellite flying forward as guided by the will of the working class! I saw the satellite flying forward holding the banner of the victory of Communism! I saw the satellite flying forward carrying the hope of peace defenders! I saw the satellite opening up roads in the boundless space and flying forward! I saw the satellite flying forward giving infinite confidence and courage to life and nature! I saw it, I saw it, the Soviet satellite flying forward excitedly!
    I saw the Soviet satellite flying forward! When people joyfully read about the new Soviet production records, the satellite is flying! When people choose the best gifts to dedicate to October, the satellite is flying! When people read aloud the slogans of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party celebrating October, the satellite is flying! When people talk about all kinds of wonderful visions of the future, the satellite is flying! When the Wall Street warmongers suddenly turn pale, the satellite is flying! When the White House is filled with painful and angry noises day and night, the satellite is flying! When the idiots in the Pentagon say it's just a piece of iron (1), the satellite is flying! When the Atlantic Fleet and military aircraft tremble at the thought of entering a museum, the satellite is flying...
    I saw the Soviet satellite flying forward, and countless stars are waving to welcome the new partner! The enthusiastic sun more enthusiastically raises its face, flushed with surprise. The gentle moon more gently reveals its satisfied smile. The Jupiter and Venus, near and far, also hastily flash their happy eyes. All the large and small stars in the sky become active and shout out loud, the shouts resounding throughout the heavens and the earth: Welcome Soviet envoy! Welcome extraterrestrial guest! In that shout there is a request: Hey, brother! Tell us an Earth story to listen to. That beautiful Earth story transmits the warm Russian breath to the stars.
    I saw the Soviet satellite flying forward. I heard it, I heard it, the satellite sending out "beep, beep, beep" signals as it flies forward! I heard the satellite cheering to celebrate the birth of a new century of human conquest of the universe! I heard the satellite cheering for the ancient fairy tales and dreams that have become reality! I heard the satellite cheering for poets and artists who have gained new languages ​​and ideas! I heard the satellite cheering to the builders of great feats – the children of Lenin! I heard the satellite cheering to all the stars and people on the stars who cheer for it! I heard the satellite busily responding cordially: "Здравствуйте! Здравствуйте!" (2) I heard it, I heard it, the satellite sending out "beep, beep, beep" signals as it flies forward!
    I saw the Soviet satellite flying forward. I thought of how many touching miracles have occurred on Soviet soil. I once walked past your world's first nuclear power plant, singing hymns of praise. I once boarded your world's first Tu-104 aircraft, singing hymns of praise. I once listened to your world's first intercontinental missile explosion, singing hymns of praise. Now I sing a triumphal song to welcome your world's first artificial satellite. Now I salute you again: "Спасибо! Спасибо!" (3) I ask you: How many more achievements will your huge hands create? I ask: How much more happiness will you bring to the world? Soviet Union, Soviet Union...
    I saw the Soviet satellite flying forward. Let the satellite speak, let the satellite participate in our great debate. Let the satellite speak, is Communism superior to Capitalism? Let the satellite speak, can the working-class party lead science forward? Let the satellite speak, who is the master of the new century of the future? Let the road of October extend through the era of fire and storms to the infinite starry sky. Let the road of October be paved to the "free kingdom" without oppression and selfishness. (4)
    Ah, I see the Soviet satellite taking the world forward along the road of October!
    Ah, I hear the Soviet satellite calling on mankind to bravely advance into the universe!

    Note (1) The US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Burke, said that the Soviet satellite was "just a piece of iron that anyone could launch." The British "Daily Mail" called this "certainly the stupidest statement of the century."
    (2) Russian, meaning hello.
    (3) Russian, meaning thank you. (4) Marx's words.

    我看见了苏维埃卫星在向前飞行……
    朱子奇
    在这些激动人心的日日夜夜，那颗美丽的小月亮，常在我心中和梦中旋转，飞行。10月10日清晨，小月亮从北京天空掠过，我身背望远镜，跟着同志们爬房上树去观赏它，欢迎它。我看见了苏维埃卫星在向前飞行，我看见了，看见了，苏维埃卫星兴奋地向前飞行！我看见卫星浴着金色的曙光欢唱着向前飞行！我看见卫星按着工人阶级的意志所指引向前飞行！我看见卫星举着共产主义胜利的锦旗向前飞行！我看见卫星载着和平保卫者的希望向前飞行！我看见卫星在无边无际的太空开辟道路向前飞行！我看见卫星给生命和大自然以无限信心和勇气向前飞行！我看见了，看见了，苏维埃卫星兴奋地向前飞行！
    我看见了苏维埃卫星在向前飞行！当人们喜悦地念着苏联生产新纪录时，卫星在飞行！当人们选择最好的礼物献给十月时，卫星在飞行！当人们朗读苏共中央庆贺十月的口号时，卫星在飞行！当人们谈论未来种种美妙的奇景时，卫星在飞行！当华尔街战贩们顿时脸色惨白时，卫星在飞行呵，当白宫日夜充满苦痛的恼怒声时，卫星在飞行呵，当五角大楼的白痴说不过是一块铁时（1），卫星在飞行呵，当大西洋舰队和军用机想到进博物馆而发抖时，卫星在飞行……
    我看见了苏维埃卫星在向前飞行，那无数无数的星球在向新来的伙伴招手欢迎！那热情的太阳越发热情地升起它被惊喜涨红的脸，那温柔的月亮更加温柔地露出了它满意的笑容，那远近的木星金星也急忙地闪着它们快活的眼睛，那满天大小星球都活跃起来了，都争着呼喊起来了，那呼声响遍天上人间：欢迎苏联使者！欢迎地球外宾！那呼声里有请求声：喂，兄弟！讲个地球故事来听听吧。那动听的地球故事把俄罗斯温暖的呼吸传给了星星。
    我看见了苏维埃卫星在向前飞行，我听见了，听见了，卫星发出噼噼噼的信号向前飞行！我听见卫星为祝贺人类征服宇宙的新世纪诞生欢呼！我听见卫星为古代的童话和梦想变成现实欢呼！我听见卫星为诗人和艺术家获得新的语言和构思欢呼！我听见卫星向伟大功勋的建树者——列宁的儿女欢呼！我听见卫星向一切向它欢呼的星球和星球上的人欢呼！我听见卫星忙着亲切地答礼：德拉斯吉！德拉斯吉！（2）我听见了，听见了，卫星发出噼噼噼的信号向前飞行！
    我看见了苏维埃卫星在向前飞行，我想起了多少动人的奇迹发生在苏维埃国土上呀，我曾吟着赞美诗走过你世上第一座原子发电站呀，我曾吟着赞美诗登上你世上第一架图—104飞机呀，我曾吟着赞美诗倾听你世上第一次州际导弹爆炸声呀，我如今更高唱凯歌欢迎你世上第一颗人造卫星呀。我如今再在你面前行礼致敬：斯巴谢波！斯巴谢波！（3）我向你发问：你巨大的手还要创建多少功绩呢？我问：你还要带给人间多少幸福呢？苏联呀，苏联呀……
    我看见了苏维埃卫星在向前飞行，让卫星发言吧，让卫星来参加我们的大辩论吧，让卫星发言吧，共产主义比不比资本主义高明？让卫星发言吧，工人阶级政党能不能领导科学前进？让卫星发言吧，谁是未来的新世纪的主人呵。让十月的路穿过烈火和风暴的年代向无穷的星空伸展吧，让十月的路铺向没有压迫和自私的“自由王国”吧。（4）
    呵，我看见苏维埃卫星沿着十月的路把世界带向前进！
    呵，我听见苏维埃卫星召唤着人类向宇宙勇敢地进军！
    注（1）美国海军参谋长贝奈特说苏联卫星“只不过是谁都能够发射的一块铁片。”英国“每日邮报”称这为“当然是本世纪中最愚蠢的”。
