(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 22nd: The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a formal statement on the evening of October 20, refuting the news reported in a special edition published by the "Today Newspaper" on the afternoon of October 20. The news stated that Syria had agreed to resolve the crisis between Syria and Turkey through the mediation of Saudi Arabian King Saud. The Syrian Foreign Ministry's statement said that the Syrian government insists on lodging a complaint with the United Nations against Turkey's troop buildup on the Syrian border, and the Syrian government will not accept any mediation.

The "Today Newspaper" had quoted Mecca Radio as saying that the Saudi King had expressed his willingness to mediate between Syria and Turkey, and that both countries had accepted his mediation. The "Today Newspaper" also reported that an official statement broadcast by Mecca Radio on the afternoon of October 20 said that delegations from Turkey and Syria were expected to arrive in Riyadh soon to discuss the crisis.

Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali received Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Syria, Saed, on October 21 and held talks with him.

According to the Syrian News Agency, al-Assali said after his meeting with the Saudi Arabian Ambassador that the Ambassador had told him everything about the Saudi King's consultations in Beirut with the Lebanese President and other senior officials regarding support for Syria.

The Damascus newspaper "Al-Ra'i" said in an editorial on October 21 entitled "Saudi King, You Are in the Crisis, Not a Mediator," that Arabs appreciate the recent statement made by the Saudi King, in which he expressed support for Syria and readiness to repel any aggression against Syria. However, the statement regarding mediation is harmful to the Arabs. The newspaper told the Saudi King, "The danger to the Arab nation cannot be avoided by mediation, but only by severing the hands used to kill you."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 22nd: The Egyptian newspaper "Al-Shaab" urged the United Nations on the 21st to take resolute and urgent action to save world peace.

The newspaper wrote on the eve of the United Nations' discussion of the Syrian issue: "A firm resolution should be passed immediately while it is not too late. The commission of inquiry requested by Syria should be established immediately, and the commission should be sent to the Middle East to conduct investigations before crimes are committed."

The newspaper accused the United States of threatening peace in the Middle East and the world. The newspaper pointed out that last month the United States sent Henderson to the Middle East to incite Syria's neighbors to attack Syria, and at the same time dispatched the Sixth Fleet to the Mediterranean to intimidate Syria.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 22nd: Syrian newspapers on the 21st refuted a statement issued by the Iraqi government on the evening of the 20th by Iraqi Acting Prime Minister Baban. In this statement, Baban said that Iraq believes that Turkey does not intend to invade Syria.

Commenting on this statement, "Al-Ra'i" pointed out that this "muddled statement" was clearly issued at the instigation of the former dictator Nuri al-Said.

    叙利亚坚持向联合国控诉土耳其
    否认赞成沙特国王从中进行调解
    叙报指责伊拉克首相为土耳其辩护
    本报综合报道　据新华社22日讯：叙利亚外交部在10月20日晚上发表正式声明，驳斥“今天报”在10月20日下午出版的特刊中所报道的消息，这条消息说，叙利亚赞成通过沙特阿拉伯国王沙特的调解来解决叙利亚和土耳其之间的危机。叙利亚外交部的声明说，叙利亚政府坚持向联合国提出对土耳其在叙利亚边境集结军队的控诉，并且叙利亚政府不接受任何调解。
    “今天报”曾经援引麦加电台说，沙特国王表示愿意在叙利亚和土耳其之间进行调解，而两国都接受了他的调解。“今天报”还报道，麦加电台在10月20日下午广播的官方声明说，预料，土耳其和叙利亚的代表团在不久以后就要到达利雅得讨论危机问题。
    叙利亚总理阿萨利10月21日接见了沙特阿拉伯驻叙利亚大使赛义德，和他进行了会谈。
    据叙利亚通讯社报道，阿萨利在和沙特阿拉伯大使会谈后说，大使已经把沙特国王在贝鲁特同黎巴嫩总统和其他高级官员就支持叙利亚问题进行磋商的一切情况告诉了他。
    大马士革“舆论报”10月21日在题为“沙特国王，你是处在危机里面，而不是调解者”的社论中说，阿拉伯人很赞赏沙特国王最近发表的一个声明，在那个声明中，他表示支持叙利亚并且准备打退对叙利亚的任何侵略。可是关于调解的声明是对阿拉伯人有害的。这家报纸对沙特国王说，“阿拉伯民族的危险不能用调解的办法，而只能用斩断那些用来杀害你的手的办法来避免。”
    新华社开罗22日电　埃及“人民报”21日敦促联合国采取坚决的紧急行动来拯救世界和平。
    这家报纸在联合国讨论叙利亚问题的前夕写道：“在现在还不太晚的时候应该立即通过坚决的决议。应该立即成立叙利亚所要求的调查委员会，在罪行还没有犯下之前派遣委员会到中东去进行调查。”
    这家报纸指责美国威胁中东和世界的和平。这家报纸指出，上月美国派了汉德逊到中东去，目的是煽动叙利亚的邻国向叙利亚进攻，同时派遣了第六舰队到地中海去对叙利亚进行恐吓。
    据新华社大马士革22日电　叙利亚的报纸21日驳斥了伊拉克代理首相巴班20日晚发表的一项伊拉克政府的声明。巴班在这一声明中说，伊拉克相信，土耳其并没有要对叙利亚进行侵略。
      “舆论报”在评论这个声明时指出，这种“乱七八糟的声明”显然是在前独裁者努里·赛义德的指使下发表的。
