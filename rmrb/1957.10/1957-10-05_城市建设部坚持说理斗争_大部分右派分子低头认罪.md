The staff of the Ministry of Urban Construction, after crushing the conspiracy of the Qian Huiyu right-wing clique, are continuing to conduct reasoning struggles with some newly exposed rightists.

The rightists exposed in this ministry used various opportunities during the rectification campaign to viciously attack the Party. Pan Yongbao, a rightist and technician at the Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute, slandered the Communist Party, saying it "was not for the benefit of the people" but "for its own interests." He also hoped that American imperialism would provoke a third world war so that he could take the opportunity to overthrow the Communist Party. Wang Ju, a rightist and engineer at the Civil Architecture Design Institute, was originally a counter-revolutionary element with blood debts. After being leniently treated by the government, he not only did not repent but took the opportunity of the Party's rectification to incite those who were subject to suppression of counter-revolutionaries to attack the Party, and viciously slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement as "groundless." Huang Guangde, another rightist and engineer at the Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute, scolded Communist Party members as "the people with the worst qualities in the world," and the leading cadres of the design institute as "incompetent people." Ji Yuguang, a Party member rightist in the Materials Section of the Materials and Finance Department, incited cadres inside and outside the Party to attack the Party during the blooming and contending period, saying that the Party was "pitch black" and that "the Communist Party is not as good as the feudal dynasty." He also distorted the facts, saying that the lives of farmers had not improved at all. Another rightist, Li Zongmin, clamored that "there is no truth in the world" and cursed that "communism will not last long." He proposed that democratic parties should take turns in power, opposed the implementation of joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce, and supported the so-called "fixed interest is not exploitation, but unearned income" fallacy of the rightist leader Zhang Naiqi. Ma Xiangrui, a Party member rightist and personnel clerk of the Survey Company, described the Party branch as a "small clique, a small sect" in order to alienate the relationship between the Party and the masses. Xue Wei, deputy director of the Transportation Section of the Public Utilities Bureau and a Party member rightist, echoed the non-Party rightists and attacked the Party in collusion. He viciously slandered, saying: "After the national liberation, the Communist Party has done more bad things than good."

Now, most of the rightists have felt that their arguments are weak and have had to lower their heads and confess their crimes to the people.

    城市建设部坚持说理斗争
    大部分右派分子低头认罪
    本报讯　城市建设部的工作人员粉碎了钱辉焴右派小集团的阴谋活动以后，正继续同新揭发出来的一些右派分子进行说理斗争。
    这个部揭发出来的右派分子，在整风期间曾经利用各种机会，恶毒地向党进攻。给水排水设计院的右派分子、技术员潘永保诬蔑共产党“并不是为了老百姓”，而是“为了自己的利益”。他还盼望美帝国主义挑起第三次世界大战，好趁机推共产党下台。民用建筑设计院右派分子、工程师王据，本来是一个有血债的反革命分子，被政府宽大处理后，不但没有悔过自新，反而趁党整风的机会，煽动肃反对象向党进攻，并恶毒地诬蔑肃反运动是“捕风捉影”。给水排水设计院另一右派分子、工程师黄广德辱骂共产党员“是世界上品质最恶劣的人”，设计院的领导干部都是“不学无术的人”；材料财务司材料处党内右派分子吉宇光在鸣放期间，煽动党内外干部向党进攻，说党是“漆黑一团”，“共产党反而不如封建王朝”，他还歪曲事实说农民的生活根本没有提高。另一个右派分子李宗敏叫嚣“世界上没有真理”，谩骂“共产主义不久长了”。他提出要民主党派轮流执政，反对对资本主义工商业实行公私合营，支持右派头子章乃器的所谓“定息不是剥削，是不劳而获”的谬论。勘察公司党内右派分子人事科员马祥瑞，把党总支说成“小集团、小宗派”，以离间党和群众的关系。公用事业管理局交通处副处长、党内右派分子薛蔚，同党外右派分子一唱一和，里应外合向党进攻。他恶毒地诬蔑说：“全国解放后，共产党做的好事没有坏事多”。
    现在，大部右派分子已感理屈词穷，不得不向人民低头认罪。
