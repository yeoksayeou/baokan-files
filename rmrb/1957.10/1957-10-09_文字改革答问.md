    Questions and Answers on Writing Reform
    Guo Moruo
    Question: Do you think Chinese characters should be reformed? Why?
    Answer: It is imperative to reform them. Using Chinese characters, the process of education for one person (from elementary school to university graduation) takes at least two years longer than in countries using phonetic writing systems. There are many other reasons, which I will not list here. In order to raise the people's cultural level more quickly and build socialism, Chinese characters must be reformed.
    Question: What are your opinions on the current policy of writing reform: on the one hand, sorting out and simplifying Chinese characters, and on the other hand, promoting Mandarin Chinese, formulating and implementing phonetic alphabets, and conducting research on phonetic writing?
    Answer: These steps are very good, and special attention should be paid to careful research in the formulation of phonetic writing.
    Question: The principle adopted for the simplification of Chinese characters is "established by convention," which means that simplified characters already commonly used by the masses are adopted as much as possible according to social habits, and gradually promoted by guiding the trend. Do you think this principle is appropriate?
    Answer: "Established by convention" is found in "Xunzi Zhengming Pian," and it is the basic principle of the formation of the entire language and writing. It is very appropriate to adopt it for simplifying Chinese characters.
    Question: What are your opinions on the simplified Chinese characters currently used in newspapers and periodicals? Do you think Chinese characters should be simplified more or less? Should they be simplified faster or slower?
    Answer: Basically good. Too much is not good, and too fast is not good either. But it should not be too little or too slow either.
    Question: How do you think the work of promoting Mandarin Chinese should be carried out and strengthened at present?
    Answer: Make full use of broadcasting, recordings, movies, touring performances by theatrical troupes, and so on.
    Question: After the phonetic scheme is determined, in which areas do you think it can be applied first?
    Answer: In children's education and literacy work, in international propaganda, and in popular science work.
    Question: What do you think is the biggest difficulty in adopting phonetic writing in our country? How can these difficulties be overcome?
    Answer: The biggest difficulty is that intellectuals who have mastered Chinese characters are too lazy to learn again. To overcome this difficulty: first, there is no need to be overly accommodating; second, intellectuals must be inspired to make conscious efforts. The fact that Mandarin Chinese has not been fully promoted is of course also a major difficulty, but today, with increasingly developed transportation, increasingly frequent contact, increasingly widespread collective life, and increasingly strengthened efforts to promote Mandarin Chinese, it can be overcome.
    Question: In order to further reform Chinese characters, what preparatory work do you think needs to be carried out urgently at present?
    Answer: First, adopt a dual-track system, with phonetic writing and Chinese characters used in parallel. Second, constantly train a large number of phonetic writing experts.
    Question: What are your opinions on the attacks on writing reform by rightists? How should everyone who supports writing reform launch a struggle against the rightists?
    Answer: The opposition of the rightists is for political purposes. They are not simply opposed to writing reform, but are anti-Party, anti-socialist, and want to overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship. All citizens must resolutely fight back against the rightists. In terms of writing reform, we should explain the reasons more clearly. Use reason and facts to fight back against the rightists, and thus educate the masses.

    文字改革答问
    郭沫若
    问：你认为汉字要不要改革？为什么？
    答：必须改革。使用汉字，单在一个人受教育的历程（从小学至大学毕业）上，比起用拼音文字的国家起码要延长两年。此外理由很多，不具述。为了更快地提高人民文化水平和建成社会主义，汉字必须加以改革。
    问：对于目前文字改革工作的方针：一方面整理和简化汉字，另一方面推广普通话，拟定和推行拼音字母，进行拼音文字的研究工作，你有什么意见？
    答：这步骤是很好的，特别在拼音文字的拟定上应该多做些仔细的研究工作。
    问：汉字简化工作所采取的原则是“约定俗成”，就是根据社会习惯，尽量采用群众已经通用的简字，因势利导，逐步推广。对于这个原则你以为是否妥当？
    答：“约定俗成”见“荀子正名篇”，是整个语言文字形成的基本原则。简化汉字采取了它，是十分妥当的。
    问：对于目前在报刊上应用的简化汉字你有什么意见？你认为汉字应该简化得多一些，还是少一些？应该简化得快一些，还是慢一些？
    答：基本上是好的。太多了不好，太快了也不好。但也不宜太少太慢。
    问：你认为目前推广普通话的工作应该怎样开展和加强？
    答：充分利用广播、录音、电影、话剧团的巡回演出等等。
    问：你认为拼音方案在确定以后可以首先在哪些方面应用？
    答：在儿童教育和扫盲工作中，在对国际宣传中，在科学普及工作中。
    问：你认为我国采用拼音文字的最大困难是什么？这些困难怎样才能克服？
    答：最大的困难是在掌握了汉字的知识分子，他们懒得再学习。克服这种困难是：一、不必过于迁就，二、要知识分子启发努力的自觉。普通话尚未十分推广当然也是一个大困难，在今天，交通日益发展、接触日益频繁、集体生活日益广泛、推广普通话的努力日益加强，是可以克服的。
    问：为了汉字的进一步改革，你认为目前急需进行哪些准备工作？
    答：一、采取双轨制，拼音与汉字并用。二、应不断训练出大批拼音文字专家。
    问：你对于右派分子对文字改革的攻击有什么意见？一切赞成文字改革的人应当怎样向右派分子展开斗争？
    答：右派分子的反对是有政治目的的，他们不是单纯反对文字改革，而是反党、反社会主义，要推翻人民民主集中制的国家。任何公民都必须坚决反击右派。在文字改革方面，应多多把道理说清楚。用道理和事实来反击右派，因而教育大众。
