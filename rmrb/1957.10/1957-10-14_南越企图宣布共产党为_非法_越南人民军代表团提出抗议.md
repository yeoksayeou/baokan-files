Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th. The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army recently wrote to the International Commission for Vietnam, protesting the South Vietnamese authorities' preparation to pass a draft law in the South Vietnamese "National Assembly" to "declare the Communist Party illegal."

The Liaison Delegation said in its letter that the content of this law, which the South Vietnamese "National Assembly" is preparing to pass, is to declare individuals and organizations that the South Vietnamese authorities consider "Communist" as illegal, stifle the people's democratic freedoms, and eliminate all progressive cultural activities that they consider "Communist." This behavior is a complete violation of Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords, which stipulates that no retaliatory discrimination should be made against individuals or groups for their activities during the period of hostilities, and that their democratic freedoms should be guaranteed.

The letter also pointed out that this conspiracy is part of the plan of the "Asian People's Anti-Communist League." Its purpose is to legitimize the South Vietnamese authorities' persecution of former resistance personnel and organizations, and to attempt to create a negative atmosphere that obstructs the work of unifying the country through general elections, in order to perpetuate the division of Vietnam.

The letter also mentioned that for three years, the South Vietnamese authorities' series of actions, from the so-called "anti-communist" movement to the blatant persecution of former resistance personnel and other patriotic people in the Weichuan and Xiangtian incidents, to the open declaration that Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords is invalid, have seriously violated the spirit of the Geneva Accords. The South Vietnamese authorities' attempt to pass a draft law to "declare the Communist Party illegal" is a continuation of the above series of illegal acts.

The Liaison Delegation reminded the International Commission to pay attention to the significance and consequences of this event, and requested the International Commission to treat the South Vietnamese authorities' conspiracy to violate the spirit of the Geneva Accords with the appropriate attitude.

    南越企图宣布共产党为“非法”
    越南人民军代表团提出抗议
    新华社河内12日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团最近写信给越南国际委员会，抗议南越当局准备在南越“国会”通过“宣布共产党非法”的法令草案。
    联络代表团在信里说，南越“国会”准备通过的这项法令的内容，就是要把南越当局认为是“共产党”的个人和组织宣布非法，窒息人民的自由民主权利和消灭一切他们认为是“共产党”的进步文化活动。这种行为完全违反日内瓦协议第十四条丙款的规定。这个条款规定，不因个人或团体在敌对行动期间的活动而加以报复歧视，并保障其民主自由。
    这封信又指出，这个阴谋是“亚洲人民反共联盟”计划的一部分。它的目的在于使南越当局对前抗战人员和前抗战组织的迫害行为合法化，并且企图制造不良空气，使通过普选以统一国家的工作遭到阻挠，以便长期分裂越南。
    信里还提到，三年来，南越当局从所谓“控共”运动直到明目张胆地迫害前抗战人员和其他爱国人士的维川、香田事件以及公开宣布日内瓦协议第十四条丙款无效等一系列行为，都严重地违反了日内瓦协议的精神。而南越当局这次企图通过“宣布共产党非法”的法令草案的事件，是上述一系列非法行为的继续。
    联络代表团提醒国际委员会注意这个事件的意义和后果，并且要求国际委员会以应有的态度来对待南越当局的这个违反日内瓦协议精神的阴谋。
