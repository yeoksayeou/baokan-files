Xinhua News Agency, October 26th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session resumed discussion of Syria's complaint against Turkey on the afternoon of the 25th.

    Bulgarian representative Tarabanov pointed out that the current tense situation in the entire Middle East is caused by the United States' policies and its intention to interfere in Syria's internal affairs. Syria does not want to join aggressive blocs and abandon its independence. Therefore, the United States is using Turkey to directly threaten Syria and preparing a pretext for American intervention in the country's internal affairs.

    Tarabanov said that Henderson, Eisenhower's special envoy to the Middle East, visited the Middle East to implement "Eisenhowerism" in Syria and restore power to the exiles opposing the government. All evidence indicates that there was a plan to attack Syria. After failing to persuade neighboring Arab countries to cooperate against Syria, the United States turned to using Turkey.

    Tarabanov supported the Soviet proposal calling on the four major powers to issue a statement of non-interference in the affairs of Arab countries.

    Sudanese representative Osman called on the General Assembly to treat Syria's complaint with the utmost seriousness and demanded that the Assembly take urgent measures to investigate the situation and stop the threat to Syria's security.

    Romanian Foreign Minister Maurer supported Syria's complaint and praised the achievements of Arab countries in defending and consolidating their independence. He favored sending an investigation team to investigate the situation and pointed out that the Romanian government had decided to participate in all efforts made by the United Nations to avoid acts of aggression in the current incident and to help countries that are subjected to aggression, should aggression occur.

    Polish representative Winiwicz said in his speech that in discussing this issue, it should be considered that Turkey is a member of two military alliances - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact. Therefore, any conflict between Syria and Turkey will inevitably lead to wider consequences. He supported Syria's complaint and condemned the US conspiracy to invade Syria.

    US representative Lodge's speech was full of blatant anti-Soviet slander and had nothing to do with Syria's complaint or the situation in the Near and Middle East. He did not respond to any of the facts cited in the speeches of the Syrian and Soviet representatives, and said that the military actions taken by Turkey were "completely reasonable." Lodge's speech showed that the United States does not want to give up its conspiracies and hostile actions against Syria.

    Representatives from the Netherlands and Cuba defended the positions of the United States and Turkey. The Cuban representative even advocated stopping the discussion of Syria's complaint.

    Japan and six other countries were originally prepared to submit a proposal recommending that the UN Secretary-General be authorized to investigate Syria's complaint, but the proposal was not submitted because the Syrian representative did not speak.

    The next meeting of the General Assembly will be held on the 28th.

    联大继续讨论叙利亚控诉案
    保罗波等国代表谴责美国侵叙阴谋
    据新华社26日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议25日下午恢复讨论叙利亚对土耳其的控诉案。
    保加利亚代表塔拉巴诺夫指出，目前整个中东紧张形势是由于美国的政策和美国打算干涉叙利亚内政所造成的。叙利亚不想参加侵略性的集团而放弃它的独立。于是美国就利用土耳其直接威胁叙利亚，并且为美国干涉这个国家的内政准备借口。
    塔拉巴诺夫说，艾森豪威尔派赴中东的特使汉德逊访问中东是想在叙利亚实行“艾森豪威尔主义”，并且使反对政府的逃亡者在叙利亚复辟。一切证据都表明，曾经有进攻叙利亚的计划。美国在劝说毗邻的阿拉伯国家协力反对叙利亚没有成功以后就转而利用土耳其。
    塔拉巴诺夫支持苏联的建议，要求四大国发表不干涉阿拉伯国家事务的声明。
    苏丹代表欧斯曼呼吁大会以最严肃的态度对待叙利亚的控诉案，并且要求大会采取紧急措施调查情况，制止对叙利亚安全的威胁。
    罗马尼亚外交部长毛雷尔支持叙利亚的控诉案，并且赞扬阿拉伯国家在保卫和巩固自己的独立方面所取得的成就。他赞成派一个调查团去调查情况，并且指出，罗马尼亚政府决定参加联合国为避免目前这个事件中发生侵略行为所作的一切努力，并且决定帮助遭到侵略的国家，假如发生侵略行为的话。
    波兰代表维尼维奇发言说，在讨论这个问题时应当考虑到，土耳其是两个军事联盟——北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约的成员国。因而，叙利亚和土耳其之间的任何冲突都会不可避免地导致更广泛的后果。他支持叙利亚的控诉案，并且谴责美国侵略叙利亚的阴谋。
    美国代表洛奇的发言通篇都是彻头彻尾的反苏谰言，而同叙利亚的控诉案以及中近东的局势毫无关系。他对叙利亚代表和苏联代表的发言中所引述的事实根本没有作任何答复，并且说土耳其采取的军事行动是“完全合理的”。洛奇的发言说明了，美国不希望放弃对叙利亚的阴谋和敌对行动。
    荷兰和古巴的代表为美国和土耳其的立场辩护，古巴代表甚至主张停止讨论叙利亚的控诉案。
    日本和其他六个国家本来准备提出一个提案，建议授权联合国秘书长去调查叙利亚的控诉，但是由于叙利亚代表没有发言，这个提案没有提出。
    大会下次会议将在28日举行。
