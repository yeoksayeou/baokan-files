Xinhua News Agency, October 18th Dispatch from Damascus: Many reports received here indicate that Turkish forces are continuing to increase their troop concentrations along the northern Syrian border.

According to sources here, the plan devised by the United States involves Turkish forces launching a sudden and rapid attack to first occupy Aleppo. The Americans estimate that Syria's current national government and army would then collapse, to be replaced by a reactionary government recently formed by Syrian traitors within Turkey.

According to a report in the "Al-Nour" newspaper on October 18th, the Syrian cabinet is considered to be in a state of continuous session to discuss the current tense situation in Syria, its developments, and measures to deal with the aggression planned by the United States and Turkey, including the implementation of general mobilization.

Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on October 17th that Syria would firmly defend its independence and would not allow anyone to infringe upon it.

According to a French Press Agency reporter citing al-Assali, "We have peaceful intentions towards all our neighbors. If, despite this, Turkey still launches an aggression against our country and is therefore responsible for causing a world war, then we are blameless ourselves, and it is Turkey that places itself in a position deserving condemnation in the face of world opinion." In referring to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's speech at the United Nations on the 16th accusing Turkey of planning to launch an aggression against Syria, al-Assali said, "If we arm ourselves, it is only to ensure our defense. We are willing to solemnly declare that we will steadfastly defend our independence, which we have obtained at great sacrifice, and we will not allow anyone to infringe upon our independence."

Syrian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Bizri broadcast to the nation on the 17th, saying, "The Syrian Army has taken all necessary steps to prepare to repel any aggression against Syria from any direction."

At the same time, Syrian newspapers reported on the 17th that the Syrian-Egyptian Joint Command is in constant contact with the Commander-in-Chief of the Syrian-Egyptian Joint Armed Forces in Cairo, Egyptian Defense Minister Amer.

According to reports, Syrian People's Resistance organizations have been formed and armed. Weapons are being distributed to the people of Aleppo, Homs, Latakia, Hama, Damascus, and areas close to the Turkish border. They are building fortifications and receiving weapons training in various locations. Several thousand new volunteers have recently joined these organizations. Newspaper reports also state that the work of training members of various mass organizations in the use of weapons is also being stepped up. Youth and student organizations and trade unions have now organized themselves to deal with any possible aggression.

According to a report in the "Al-Yaum" newspaper on October 18th, all political parties, trade unions, and public organizations in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo participated in a public gathering convened by Aleppo Governor Kulli on the evening of October 17th. The participants in the meeting supported the government's measures to resist aggression and expressed their full spiritual and material support for the government. They also requested that the governor set a date for all residents of the city to begin digging air-raid shelters and mobilize all people to resist foreign aggressors.

　　叙利亚举国一心准备抗击侵略
    战斗部队枕戈待旦  爱国人民武装起来
    本报综合报道  据新华社18日讯：大马士革消息：这里接到的许多消息表明，土耳其方面沿叙利亚北部边境集结的军队仍在不断增加。
    据这里的人士说，美国所拟订的计划是由土耳其军队用突然和迅速的攻击首先占领阿勒颇。这样，按照他们的估计，叙利亚目前的国家政权和军队就将崩溃，而代之以由叙利亚叛国分子最近在土耳其境内组成的反动政府。
    据“光明报”18日报道，叙利亚内阁认为它是处在持续开会状态，以便商讨目前叙利亚的紧张局势，它的发展，以及为了对付美国和土耳其策划的侵略而采取的措施，其中包括实行总动员。
    叙利亚总理阿萨利10月17日说，叙利亚将坚定地保卫自己的独立，决不容许任何人侵犯。
    据法新社记者援引阿萨利的话说：我们对我们的一切邻邦都有和平的意愿。如果尽管如此而土耳其仍然对我国发动侵略因而负有引起世界大战的责任，那么我们对自己是无可责备的，反而是土耳其使自己在世界舆论面前处于该受谴责的地位。阿萨利在谈到苏联外交部长葛罗米柯16日在联合国指责土耳其策划对叙利亚发动侵略的发言时说：如果我们武装自己，那仅仅是为了保证我们的防御。我们愿意郑重声明，我们将坚定不移地保卫我们以重大牺牲换得来的独立，我们决不允许任何人侵犯我们的独立。
    叙利亚武装部队总司令比兹里17日向全国人民广播说，“叙利亚陆军已经采取了一切必要的步骤，准备击退任何方面对叙利亚的任何侵略。”
    同时，据叙利亚的报纸17日报道，叙埃联合司令部与在开罗的叙埃联合武装部队总司令、埃及国防部长阿密尔保持着经常的联系。
    据报纸说，叙利亚人民抵抗组织已经组成，并且武装起来了。武器正在分发给阿勒颇、霍姆斯、拉塔基亚、哈马、大马士革以及靠近土耳其的边境地区的人民。他们正在各地构筑防御工事和接受掌握武器的训练。最近又有好几千名新的志愿人员参加了这些组织。报纸消息还说，训练各群众团体成员使用武器的工作也在加紧进行。青年和学生组织以及工会现在已经组织起来，准备应付可能发生的一切侵略。
    据“今天报”18日报道，叙利亚北方城市阿勒颇的所有政党、工会和公众团体都参加了阿勒颇省长库利10月17日晚上召开的一个公众集会。参加大会的人都支持政府抵抗侵略的措施，并且表示他们在精神上和物质上完全支持政府。他们也要求省长规定日期，让城内所有居民都开始挖掘防空壕，动员所有的人抵抗外国侵略者。
