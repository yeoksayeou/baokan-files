Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: The State Council's Fourth and Fifth Offices on October 7th approved and transmitted the report, "Opinions on Strengthening the Acquisition and Utilization of Waste Products and Scrap Materials." This report was jointly proposed by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives.

The two offices of the State Council considered that the opinions put forward in the report were basically correct. They required the people's committees of all provinces (cities) and autonomous regions to study and implement them according to specific circumstances, and to strengthen leadership over this work.

The report stated: In addition to scrap steel, scrap tin, scrap lead, and scrap copper, which have been stipulated by the state for unified acquisition, local areas may manage scrap iron as unified acquisition materials according to needs, and the supply and marketing should be balanced and connected.

Waste rubber and waste tires are important raw materials for the manufacture of reclaimed rubber and handicraft production, especially waste tires are needed in a wide range, while resources are relatively scarce. It is recommended that local areas include these two materials in the unified acquisition materials management.

There are many other types of waste products and scrap materials. Whether or not to include some of them as unified acquisition materials shall be determined by the provincial (municipal) people's committees based on specific circumstances. For materials not included in the unified acquisition, supply and marketing cooperatives can acquire them, and handicraft cooperatives can also acquire and use them themselves, under the principle of complying with local market management.

In order to rationally distribute waste products and scrap materials and gradually organize supply in a planned manner, the report proposes five principles:

	(1) Scrap steel and scrap iron acquired in various places, in addition to supplying a certain amount for steelmaking, the remainder should be mainly supplied to handicrafts when balancing and distributing locally.

	(2) When allocating waste tires uniformly within the province (city), whole waste tires that can be used as tires with slight repairs should be supplied to horse-drawn carriages. The rest should be supplied first to production materials (such as ginning shafts, etc.) production departments, and then to consumer goods (such as shoe soles, etc.) production departments. If there is a surplus or shortage in a province (city), the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives shall be responsible for regulation.

	(3) Rags, waste paper, waste cotton, etc., should be distinguished by variety and supplied separately according to the needs of large-scale industry and handicrafts, and different uses. The part belonging to papermaking raw materials should be supplied to handicrafts, in addition to supplying large-scale industries.

	(4) The supply of waste products and scrap materials, except for waste copper, waste tin, waste lead, etc., should generally be supplied locally first, and then transferred to other places within the province (city). After the acquisition of various waste products and scrap materials, they should be sorted and organized as much as possible, so as to make the best use of them. In organizing the supply, intermediate links should be reduced as much as possible.

	(5) Regarding the supply price of waste products and scrap materials, except for materials included in the unified acquisition and for which the state (including provinces and cities) has unified regulations, the profit of supply and marketing cooperatives generally shall not exceed the comprehensive indicators stipulated by the relevant central departments. If the competent departments of each province (city) need to adjust prices and profits according to the local specific circumstances, they may report to the provincial (municipal) people's committees for examination and approval. Within a region, prices should be unified as much as possible, and the price difference with neighboring areas should not be too disparate.

The report stipulates that regarding the materials required by handicraft cooperatives that are subject to unified acquisition by the state, the regulations of the State Council passed on August 9 regarding the prohibition of agricultural products and other materials acquired and unifiedly acquired by the state from entering the free market shall be followed; for other waste products and scrap materials that are not included in the scope of unified acquisition by the state, supply and marketing cooperatives must pay attention to maintaining the original reasonable acquisition relationship and cooperative relationship of handicraft cooperatives when acquiring them.

　　加强废品废料的收购和利用
    供销总社和手工业联合总社筹委会提出意见
    据新华社11日讯　国务院第四办公室和第五办公室在10月7日批转了“关于加强废品废料的收购和利用的意见”的报告。这项报告是中华全国供销合作总社和全国手工业合作社联合总社筹委会共同提出的。
    国务院这二个办公室认为报告中提出的意见基本上是正确的。要求各省（市），自治区人民委员会根据具体情况研究执行，并加强对这一工作的领导。
    报告中说：除了废钢、废锡、废铅、废铜已由国家规定统一收购以外，对于废铁，地方可以根据需要，按统一收购物资管理，并应使供销间平衡衔接。
    废橡胶和废轮胎为制造再生胶和手工业生产的重要原料，特别是废轮胎需要面广，而资源较少，建议地方把这两种物资列入统一收购物资管理。
    其他废品废料，品种很多，有的是否列为统一收购的物资，由省（市）人民委员会根据具体情况确定。未列为统一收购的物资，在服从当地市场管理的原则下，供销社可以收购，手工业合作社也可以自收自用。
    为了使废品废料合理地分配和逐步作到有计划地组织供应，报告提出了五项原则：
    （1）各地收购的废钢废铁，除以一定数量供给炼钢用以外，其余的在地方平衡分配时，主要是供给手工业。
    （2）废轮胎在省（市）范围内统一安排分配时，对于稍加修补即可用作车胎的整只废轮胎，应当供给马车使用，其余的应当首先供给生产资料（如轧花轴等）生产部门，其次供给生活资料（如鞋底等）生产部门。省（市）有多余或不足时，由全国供销总社负责调剂。
    （3）破布、废纸、废棉等，应该区分品种，按照大工业和手工业的需要和不同使用价值分别供应。属于造纸原料的部分，除供应大工业以外，也应照顾手工业的需要。
    （4）废品废料的供应，除废铜、废锡、废铅等以外，在省（市）范围内，一般地应该先供应当地，而后外调。各种废品废料在收购后，要尽量作到分类整理，以便物尽其用。在组织供应中，应当尽量减少中间环节。
    （5）关于废品废料的供应价格，除列入统一收购的物资，国家（包括省、市）已有统一规定的以外，其他品种，供销社经营的利润一般不得超过中央有关部门规定的综合指标。各省（市）主管部门按照当地具体情况，对价格和利润需要调整时，可以报省（市）人民委员会审查确定。在一个地区内，价格尽量求其统一，对邻区的差价不应悬殊太大。
    报告中规定，关于手工业合作社所需废品废料中国家规定统一收购的物资，按照国务院8月9日通过的关于由国家计划收购和统一收购的农产品和其他物资不准进入自由市场的规定办理；对于所需未列入国家统一收购范围的其他废品废料，供销合作社收购时，必须注意保持手工业合作社原来的合理的收购关系和协作关系。
