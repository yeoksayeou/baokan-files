    A Song of Joy Circling the Earth
    Are you flying alone, oh satellite? Listen: twenty-six billion "me's" are beating in your heart; are you rising alone to circle the earth? Listen: countless songs of joy are swirling rapidly in the earth's atmosphere. Oh, songs of joy, keeping time with your *beep beep beep* rhythm, the people singing them have broken through all isolation and blockade: in the streets of Washington people are arguing loudly, in Tokyo even the shoe-shining children in Hibiya are proudly shouting! "America has lost face!" All that's left is "Superman's" "specialty" of sneaking around. Fly, expand, boast! Stocks, capitalist wallets, and empty boasts! Time flies by, circle after circle, victory increases second by second, the great socialist motherland, leading humanity forward, has burst forth with an epoch-making achievement again forty years later! How many more miracles will the Soviets burst forth with? Forward! To Mars, Venus, other stars... Let's talk when we meet!

    环绕地球的欢歌
    俯拾是你自己一个飞么？听听：在你心脏里跳动着二十六亿个“我”；是你自己一个升起环绕地球么？听听：环绕地球上空疾卷过无数传唱的欢歌。欢歌啊，依着你的噼噼噼打拍，唱的人们冲开了一切隔绝封锁：在华盛顿街头人们大声议论，在东京日比谷擦鞋儿童也骄傲地呼喝！“美国丢了脸”！只剩下“超人”“拿手”的偷摸，飞吧涨吧吹吧！股票、资本家的荷包和法螺！时间，一圈一圈地飞过，胜利，一秒钟一秒钟地增多，带领着人类前进的伟大社会主义祖国，四十年后的今天又爆出划时代的收获！究竟苏维埃还有多少奇迹要爆出？前进！到火星、金星、另外的恒星……见面时再说！
