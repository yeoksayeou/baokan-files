Wuhan Yuhua Cotton Mill started its rectification campaign on August 20th. During the rectification, all employees actively criticized the factory's cadres' work style, production management, welfare, and the relationship between the Party and the masses. By September 20th, all employees had put forward a total of 3,277 opinions and posted 2,020 wall posters. Here are excerpts from some of the wall posters:

    Warehouse Symposium

    Landlord (Warehouse Director): Today, I have invited the "Large Spindle," "Steel Ring," and other comrades to participate in the symposium, mainly to help the Party's rectification, overcome the "three evils" of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism. You have lived in our factory's small warehouse for quite some time, and I hope you will speak actively in the spirit of "saying everything you know and saying it without reservation."

    Large Spindle: We have a total of 40,000 sets, which, calculated at eight yuan per set, is worth 320,000 yuan, a considerable amount of property. Since 1954, when the small spindles were converted, the two engineers who designed the conversion to small spindles, Wan Yuqi and Ye Kuisheng, and the veteran worker Jin Hanwen, were all awarded prizes. The small spindles have been in operation for four years, and their superiority has been affirmed. However, the leadership has kept us imprisoned for a long time without any processing. The Hankou Shenxin Cotton Mill came to transfer us, but we were not given. The Xi'an Dahua Cotton Mill went through a lot of trouble to transfer 3,000 sets. They want them, but we don't give them, and we don't take good care of ourselves, so we are piled up in a mess in Warehouse No. 2, making many of our brothers hunchbacked. Isn't this bureaucracy on the part of the leadership? At this rate, we will have to retire early.

    Steel Ring: Last year, our factory spun 42-count yarn as a new product. After research by engineering and technical personnel, 1 3/8-inch steel rings were required, 10,000 of them. The manager's office and Chief Engineer Ye ordered the supply section to supply them within a time limit. The supply section was panicked and finally spent 11,000 yuan in August to invite us from Shanghai to the Wuhan Yuhua Factory. Strangely enough, as soon as we arrived at the factory, we were put into a cold palace, and no one cared about us, which was really puzzling. After careful investigation, it turned out that the factory had 1 1/2-inch steel rings, which had replaced us and were working very well. It's not that you wasted more than 10,000 yuan and we still complain, but couldn't you have considered it beforehand? It's really being generous at the public's expense! Other brothers have made contributions on the production front, but we have spent a lot of the workers' labor, but we are here for a long-term rest. What can we say?

    Variable Speed Pulley, Drop Wire Hook, and Tooth Screw Nut (in unison): Although you two are "heroes with no place to use your skills," you still have a place to settle down. It's a pity that we were originally the "three treasures" used by Director Jiang Dejun of the weaving workshop to eliminate substandard cloth. Because Director Jiang's "technical measures" were not "miscalculated," we were dismissed as soon as he left, wasting thousands of yuan in vain. Even more pitiful is that we have "no burial place" and are exposed to the sun and rain. Now even our bones have rotted away, sigh, sigh, sigh…

    Editor's Note on Wall Poster: The Party committee and administrative leadership of our factory also lack ideological education for engineering and technical personnel, and there is excessive accommodation, which has encouraged the engineering personnel to adopt an indifferent attitude towards state property, resulting in a large backlog and waste of materials. The leadership usually grasps trivial matters very tightly, but turns a deaf ear and a blind eye to such large losses. Is this "only picking up sesame seeds and ignoring spilled sesame oil"?

    What a "Quality First"!

    The leadership shouts: "Quality First"!
    The leadership calls: "Quality First"!
    May I ask the leadership: - No one is in charge of quality, are you still going to say "Quality First"?

    In August, the width of the cloth in the cloth factory suddenly increased. The regulation was 91.44 cm, but 92.25 cm and even 92.3 cm appeared. As a result, the warp density of the cloth was not enough. The testing department tested, and the technical supervision department investigated. Notice! Notice! One after another was sent to the weaving workshop, but who read them? Who cared?

    Ask the workshop director: Good, good, good, it will be resolved.
    Ask the foreman: Good, good, good, it will be resolved immediately, but if my shift is adjusted, what if the next shift doesn't adjust it?
    Ask the deputy foreman: (who is more straightforward), let's not adjust it, adjusting it will cause more yarn breaks, and it will be difficult to make a living.

    So, one day, two days, half a month passed, and the problem was still a problem, but no one solved it.

    We want to ask the weaving workshop: Are you going to solve it or not? Are you responsible for your work or not?

    Excerpt from Yuhua Cotton Mill's Jinfeng News

    How were these two thousand yuan paid out?

    The younger brother of Song Yuezhen, a worker in the weaving workshop (a non-dependent relative), was hospitalized in the workers' hospital in 1956. On September 26, he was transferred from the workers' hospital to the Tuberculosis Hospital, and the medical expenses were settled at more than 800 yuan. On March 22, 1957, he was transferred from the Tuberculosis Hospital to the Wuhan Hospital, and the medical expenses were settled at 1,168.28 yuan. In July, the hospital wanted to cancel the lung disease beds, and called the factory to contact them to take the patient back. The factory's medical department only then asked the workshop, and as a result, the workshop supervisor and the union负责人 spent three or four days to clarify the problem. Song Yuezhen's younger brother was a non-dependent relative and should have paid for it himself, but the factory paid more than 2,000 yuan in advance, treating him as a dependent relative. What responsibility did the medical department bear? After the three-part form was issued, why didn't they inquire about it? When the second bill was settled and it was found that so much money had been spent, how did the manager's office approve it? And how was the financial system controlled?

    A plan must be made for how many people die each year

    In 1956, the higher-level trade union asked each enterprise unit to make a plan for the number of deaths in a year. 主委冯国辉 (Chairman Feng Guohui) of the Labor Insurance Committee helplessly came to ask me what to do. I have lived for fifty years, and this is the first time I have heard of having to make a plan for deaths. At the time, I said: "There's no way, we can only plan for two deaths, one for me and one for you." As a result, there were a total of four deaths last year, exceeding the "death plan" by 100%. It's really: Bureaucracy is rampant, and lower-level cadres suffer.

    企业里的大字报
    武汉市裕华纱厂自8月20号开始整风。在整风中，全厂职工积极对本厂干部作风、生产管理、生活福利、党群关系等方面提出了批评，到9月20日为止，全厂职工共提出三千二百七十七条意见，贴出了二千零二十张大字报。现将其中一部分大字报摘录如下：
    仓库座谈会
    房东（仓库主任）：今天请了大锭子、钢领圈和其他诸位同志来参加座谈会，主要是帮助党整风，克服官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义这“三害”，想你们在本厂小库住了不少的日子，希望本着“知无不言、言无不尽”的精神，踊跃发言。
    大锭子：我们一共有四万套，按每套八元计算，价值三十二万元，是很大一笔财产。自从1954年改装小锭子，把我们换下来以后，设计改小锭子的万毓琦、叶奎声二位工程师与老师傅金汉文等都得了奖，小锭子运转至今已有四年了，它的优越性是肯定了的。可是，领导上却把我们长期软禁起来，不作处理。汉口申新纱厂来调拨，不给。西安大华纱厂费了不少周折，才拨去了三千套。人家要，不给，而自己又不好好照顾，让我们在二号栈堆得乱七八糟，弄得弟兄们好多都颈弯背驼。这是不是领导上官僚主义呢？照这样下去，我们得提前告老退休了。
    钢领圈：去年我厂纺四十二支纱新产品，经工程技术人员研究，必须1 3/8吋的钢领圈一万只。经理室和叶总工程师敕令供应科限期供应，慌得供应科六神无主，好容易才在8月份花了一万一千元，将我们从上海请来武汉裕华厂。说也奇怪，我们刚一到厂就被打入冷宫，无人过问，真令人纳闷。仔细一打听：原来本厂有1 1/2吋的钢领圈，它们已代替了我们，而且工作得非常出色。并不是你们冤枉花了一万多元，我们还要抱怨，可你们难道事先不能考虑一下吗？真是慷公家之慨！别的兄弟们都在生产战线上立了功，而我们花了工人同志们许多劳动力，却在这里长期休养，这真是叫人从何说起？
    变速皮带盘吊综钩及牙螺丝母（异口同声）：你们二位虽然是“英雄无用武之地”，但到底还有个安身之处，可怜我们原是织造车间姜德骏主任消灭次布的“三宝”，由于姜主任的“技措（技术措施）”不“计错（计算错误）”，他刚刚走，我们就被革职拿办，白白浪费了几千元。更可怜的是我们“死无葬身之地”，被日晒雨淋，到现在连尸骨都腐烂无存了，?，?，?……
    大字报编者按：我厂党委及行政领导对工程技术人员的思想教育亦嫌不足，有过分迁就的现象，以致助长了工程人员对国家财产采取漠不关心的态度，造成材料大量积压与浪费。领导上平时对琐碎小事也抓得蛮紧，而对这种大量的损失则充耳无闻，熟视无睹，这是否“只顾拣芝麻，不管泼香油”呢？
    裕华纱厂齐放社
    好一个“质量第一”！
    领导喊：“质量第一”！
    领导叫：“质量第一”！
    请问领导：——质量无人管，是不是还要说“质量第一”？
      8月，布厂的布幅突然增宽，规定九一点四四公分，却出现了九二点二五甚至还有九二点三的，于是乎，布的经线密度不够了，试验科试，技术监督科查。通知！通知！一张一张送到织造车间，可是谁看呢？谁管呢？
    问车间主任：好，好，好，就解决。
    问工长：好，好，好，马上就解决，可是，我这个班调整了，下班不调整怎么办？
    问副工长：（到还干脆），不调整吧，调整了断头多，生活不好做。
    于是，一天两天半个月过去了，问题还是问题，却始终无人解决。
    我们要问织造车间：你们到底解决不解决？你们到底对工作负责不负责？
    摘自裕华纱厂金风报
    这两千多元是怎么付出去的？
    织造车间工人宋月珍的弟弟（非供养亲属）于1956年因病住工人医院，在9月26日由工人医院转结核病院结算医药费共八百多元。到1957年3月22日又由结核病院转武汉医院结算医药费用共一千一百六十八点二八元，到7月份该医院要取消肺病病床，来电话与厂中联系接回病人。厂里医疗科才找车间询问，结果车间主管与工会负责人花了三、四天时间，才把问题搞清楚，宋月珍的弟弟是非供养亲属，应该由他本人付费，而厂里却将他当作供养亲属垫款两千多元。请问医疗科负的什么责？开了三联单以后，为什么就不问讯了？第二次结账时发现花这多钱，经理室是怎么批的？而财务制度又是怎么掌握的？

    一年死多少人也要订计划
    1956年上级工会要求各企业单位订一年的死人计划，冯国辉主委（劳动保险委员会）无可奈何来问我怎么办？我活了五十年，还是第一次听到要订死人计划。当时，我说：“没办法，就只好订死两个，我一个，你一个。”结果去年死亡共计是四人，超额百分之百完成了“死人计划”。真是：官僚主义逞强，下级干部遭殃。
