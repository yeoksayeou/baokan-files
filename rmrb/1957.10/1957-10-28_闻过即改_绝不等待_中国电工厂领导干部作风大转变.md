Correcting Mistakes Immediately, No Waiting
Major Shift in the Work Style of Leading Cadres at the China Electric Factory

(Reported by this newspaper) The Communist Party members of the Shanghai Joint State-Private China Electric Factory are accepting the criticisms raised by the masses during the rectification campaign, earnestly improving their work style, and strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses, which has won the praise of the masses.

After a large number of opinions were put forward, the leadership was greatly shaken and unanimously believed that most of these opinions were correct and helpful to them, and they were willing to earnestly improve. However, at that time, the leading cadres had a wait-and-see attitude, thinking that now there was a great airing of views, and the leadership work was very busy, so they would wait until the rectification stage to sit down and examine and improve.

After studying these situations, the Party General Branch believed that all Party members should immediately change their work style based on the opinions of the masses, resolutely not wait, and earnestly achieve rectification and correction at the same time. It also held continuous meetings to focus on discussing specific measures for leading cadres to change their work style: 1. Every factory holiday, Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League leading cadres take turns visiting the families of workers with difficulties in their lives and sick workers to understand the situation and help them solve their problems; 2. Leading cadres spend half a day each week going to the workshop to participate in physical labor and help the masses solve various problems; 3. Hold a worker heart-to-heart meeting once a week, taking turns listening to workers' opinions; 4. Resolutely change the special status of leading cadres, put down their airs, and integrate with the masses.

After the system was established, the leading cadres immediately implemented it. Now, Party member factory directors, Party General Branch secretaries, trade union chairmen, and other leaders have successively used Sundays to visit workers' families and talk to workers. After visiting the family of Chen Shoujun, a worker in the packaging room, Trade Union Chairman Yang Jiquan discovered that his family had financial difficulties, so the trade union gave him a subsidy, and Chen Shoujun was very grateful. In the past, workers had a lot of opinions about the public factory director Tang Jianbai's rigid work style and rude attitude. Now the factory director has changed his work style, patiently listening to the workers' opinions, and carefully analyzing and studying any problems in production. Seeing that his work style has changed, the workers not only look for the factory director when there are problems in production, but also go to the factory director to talk about some problems in their lives. The workers criticized General Branch Secretary Teng Qiming for his poor contact with the masses, and his scope was not wide enough, only paying attention to some activists. Now, in addition to spending half a day each week participating in labor, Teng Qiming also often goes to the workshop to have more contact with the masses. Therefore, after get off work, workers and apprentices often talk to him.

The masses have seen with their own eyes that the leadership is determined to improve their work and change their work style, and their production enthusiasm is getting higher and higher: In August, the factory completed its task according to plan; after the rectification campaign began in September, it overfulfilled its task; this month, it can not only overfulfill its task, but also improve the quality of its products.

### 闻过即改　绝不等待  中国电工厂领导干部作风大转变

    闻过即改　绝不等待
    中国电工厂领导干部作风大转变
    本报讯　上海公私合营中国电工厂的共产党员接受群众在整风中提出的批评，认真改进作风，密切党与群众的关系，受到群众的称赞。
    大量意见提出以后，领导上震动很大，一致认为这些意见绝大部分是正确的，对自己有帮助，并愿意认真改进。但当时领导干部存在着等待思想，认为现在大鸣大放，而且领导工作很忙，等到将来整改阶段坐下来再检查改进。
    党总支在研究了这些情况以后，认为全体党员应该根据群众意见，马上转变作风，决不等待，切实做到边整边改，并连续召开会议，着重讨论了领导干部转变作风的具体措施：一、每逢厂礼拜，党、行政、工会、共青团领导干部轮流访问生活上有困难的职工和生病职工的家庭，了解情况，帮助他们解决问题；二、领导干部每星期以半天时间下车间参加体力劳动，帮助群众解决各种问题；三、每星期召开一次职工谈心会，轮流听取职工意见；四、切实改变领导干部特殊化的情况，放下架子，与群众打成一片。
    制度订出后，领导干部便立即执行。现在党员厂长、党总支书记、工会主席等领导人都先后利用星期天访问职工家庭，和职工谈心。工会主席杨纪泉在访问包装间工人陈寿君家庭以后，发现他家中生活困难，就由工会给予补助，陈寿君非常感激。过去工人对公方厂长唐坚柏作风生硬、态度粗暴很有意见。现在厂长转变了作风，耐心地听取工人意见，生产上有什么问题，仔细地进行分析研究。工人看他作风有了转变，不但在生产上有什么问题找厂长，而且有些生活上的问题也去找厂长谈谈。工人批评总支书记滕企明联系群众差，面也不广，只注意一些积极分子。现在滕企明除了每星期有半天参加劳动外，还经常下车间和群众多接触，因此，下班以后，工人、艺徒经常找他谈心。
    群众亲眼看到领导上有决心改进工作、转变作风，生产情绪愈来愈高：8月份，这个厂按计划完成任务；9月份开始整风以后，超额完成任务；本月份不但可以超额完成任务，而且产品质量有了提高。
