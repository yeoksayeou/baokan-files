Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Republic of San Marino has been occupied by hundreds of Italian light cavalry since the 12th. These light cavalrymen are commanded by the captain of the San Marino constabulary, who is under orders to "maintain order."

Few residents are venturing out, and the streets are almost deserted. Many households in San Marino have their doors and windows tightly shut, protesting the infringement of the republic's independence.

The San Marino Communist Party has issued an appeal to the people, calling on them to oppose external pressure and strive for the earliest possible determination of the Grand Council election. The appeal states, "We will confront illegal actions with mass actions to restore the rule of law. We must heighten our vigilance against provocations and resist external pressure with national independence. All those who cherish the honor of their motherland will be with us. We call on all citizens to unite around the San Marino Communist Party, which has consistently defended the rights of the people. San Marino will surely be free."

The officials of the Republic of San Marino government were forced to announce their resignation on the 12th and have left their official residences.

In order to help overthrow the republic's government, which was composed of Communists and Socialists, and to allow the so-called "provisional government" of the Christian Democrats to take power, the Italian ruling clique, after launching a reactionary coup on October 1st, cut off all contact between the small republic, which has no means of self-defense, and the outside world. This has left the republic's more than 13,000 residents, who are surrounded by Italian territory, facing the threat of starvation.

In a statement to the people before resigning, the San Marino government said: "Because the Italian government has interfered in the internal affairs of San Marino by recognizing the so-called 'provisional government,' imposing an armed blockade on the republic, and providing armed police forces to the 'provisional government,' the San Marino People's Government is in a dilemma and has therefore decided to cease its futile resistance today, after twelve years in power."

    圣马力诺被意大利骑兵侵占
    共产党号召反对外来压力
    合法政府在武装干涉下被迫辞职
    本报综合报道　新华社讯：圣马力诺共和国从12日起被数百名意大利轻骑兵所占领。这些轻骑兵由受命“维持秩序”的圣马力诺宪兵队长统率。
    居民很少出外，街道上几乎空无一人。圣马力诺许多住户都门窗紧闭，对侵犯共和国独立的行为表示抗议。
    圣马力诺共产党向人民发出呼吁书，号召他们反对外来压力，争取尽快确定大议会的选举。呼吁书说，“我们将用恢复法制的群众性行动来对抗非法行动。我们要提高警惕对付挑衅，以民族独立对抗外来压力。一切珍视祖国荣誉的人都将同我们在一起。我们号召全体公民团结在一贯保卫人民权利的圣马力诺共产党的周围。圣马力诺一定会自由。”
    圣马力诺共和国政府人员已在12日被迫宣布辞职，离开了官邸。
    意大利统治集团为了帮助推翻这个共和国的由共产党和社会党人组成的政府，让天主教民主党人的所谓“临时政府”执政，在10月1日反动政变发动以后，断绝了这个小小的没有自卫力量的共和国同外界的一切联系，这就使得这个为意大利领土所包围的共和国的一万三千多名居民面临着饥饿的威胁。
    圣马力诺政府在辞职前发表的告人民书说：“由于意大利政府干涉圣马力诺内政承认了所谓‘临时政府’、对共和国进行武装封锁、向‘临时政府’提供武装警察部队，圣马力诺人民政府处于进退维谷的境地，因此不得不在执政十二年后的今天决定停止无益的抵抗。”
