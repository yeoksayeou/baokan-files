    Twenty-Four Cadres from Jin County Return to Production Posts

    (Our Newspaper News) Twenty-four district and township cadres from Jin County, Liaoning Province, have returned to their production posts. Han Jiancheng, formerly the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in Bali Township, is now the secretary of a production team branch in the Fengchan Agricultural Cooperative; Long Zichuan, the propaganda committee member of the Shihu Township Party Committee, is now a fitter at the Lushun-Dalian Agricultural Machinery Factory. They are in good spirits and actively engaged in production since returning to the labor front.

    In addition, since this spring, a total of 221 cadres from the county, district, and township levels have been transferred to lower levels, greatly strengthening the leadership of grassroots organizations.

    此外，自今年春天以来，全县还下放了县、区、乡三级干部二百二十一名，大大地加强了基层组织的领导力量。
