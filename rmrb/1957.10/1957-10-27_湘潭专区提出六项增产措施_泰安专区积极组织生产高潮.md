    Xiangtan Special District Proposes Six Measures to Increase Production
    Tai'an Special District Actively Organizes a Production Upsurge
    (Our Newspaper News) According to Shandong Dazhong Daily: The Tai'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Commissioner's Office jointly convened a meeting of county heads and county party committee cooperation ministers from October 12th to 18th, deploying winter work; followed by an enlarged meeting of the Prefectural Committee to convey the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and further discussed in detail how to organize a production upsurge.
    At these meetings, a comprehensive analysis was made of the current rural situation in Tai'an Special District, believing that Tai'an Special District suffered from a double whammy of floods and droughts, resulting in a serious reduction in agricultural production this year. Therefore, this year is one of the more difficult years since liberation. Party committees and governments at all levels must make correct estimates and analyses of the current situation in order to proactively do their work and reverse the difficult situation.
    The meeting believed that the main ideological obstacle to launching a production upsurge and carrying out farmland water conservancy construction is right-leaning conservative thinking in leadership. It is understood that some leaders underestimate the potential for increased production, believing that "increased production has reached its peak" and that "there is nothing to do." They lack confidence in the requirement of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) that the average yield per mu should reach 500 jin within twelve years in the area south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River. They lack the spirit of relying on the great collective power of cooperatives to seize material resources from nature, but instead shrink back and lack enthusiasm. This right-leaning conservative thinking should be deeply criticized to clear obstacles to the movement. The effective method for solving ideological problems and overcoming difficulties is still a great debate. Through great debate, we must pool the wisdom of the masses, make up for the lack of experience, and make the plan both proactive and reliable. More importantly, through great debate, we must profoundly educate the masses in production and construction and stimulate the masses' consciousness in participating in production and construction.
    The meeting demanded that in the process of launching a production upsurge, all localities should formulate plans for this winter and next spring and five-year and ten-year production plans for each cooperative under the general requirements of "adapting to local conditions and adapting to the cooperative" and striving for increased production. In terms of water conservancy construction, it is necessary to earnestly implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and grasp the spirit of spending less money, doing more things, and achieving greater benefits. In addition, it is also necessary to mobilize women, be diligent and thrifty in managing their households, carry out a conservation movement, and arrange family life well to facilitate farmland water conservancy construction.

    湘潭专区提出六项增产措施
    泰安专区积极组织生产高潮
    本报讯　据山东大众日报消息：中共泰安地委和专署于10月12日到18日联合召开了县长和县委合作部长会议，布置了冬季工作；接着又举行了地委扩大会议，传达中共中央三中全会的精神，对如何组织生产高潮，进一步作了详细的讨论。
    在这些会议上，对泰安专区当前的农村情况做了全面的分析，认为泰安专区遭受水灾和旱灾的双重袭击，以致今年农业生产严重减产，因此，今年是解放以来较为困难的一年。各级党委、政府必须对当前的情况作正确的估计和分析，以便主动的做好工作，扭转困难局面。
    会议认为，发动生产高潮，开展农田水利建设，主要的思想障碍是领导上的右倾保守思想。据了解，有些领导对增产潜力估计不足，认为“增产已经到顶”，认为“没有什么搞头了”；对于全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的黄河以南淮河以北地区十二年内平均每亩产量达到五百斤的要求缺乏信心。他们缺乏依靠合作社这个伟大集体力量向自然夺取物质资料的气魄，而是畏缩不前，劲头不足。这种右倾保守思想应当深刻批判以扫清运动的障碍。解决思想问 题和克服困难的有效方法，仍然是大辩论。要通过大辩论集中群众智慧，弥补经验的不足，把计划订的既积极又可靠。更重要的是要通过大辩论，在生产建设方面深刻地教育群众，激发群众参加生产建设的自觉性。
    会议要求，在发动生产高潮过程中，各地应在“因地制宜，因社制宜”，争取增产的总要求之下，要求每个社都制定出今冬明春的计划和五年、十年的生产规划。在兴修水利方面，要切实贯彻“多、快、好、省”的方针，掌握花钱少、办事多、效益大的精神。此外，还要发动妇女，勤俭持家，开展节约运动，安排好家庭生活，以利于农田水利建设。
