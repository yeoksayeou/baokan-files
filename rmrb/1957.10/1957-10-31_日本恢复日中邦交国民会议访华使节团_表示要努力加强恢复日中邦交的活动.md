Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 30th - The Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations Visiting Delegation issued a statement in Hong Kong on the 29th saying: The development of trade between Japan and China, Japan's independence, and the peace of Asia and the world all require the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between Japan and China. In order to promote the early restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, we will work hard to strengthen the national movement to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations after returning to Japan.
The statement said: The Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and we repeatedly emphasize that we do not recognize the "two Chinas" statement.
The statement also said: When we visited various parts of China, we saw that China's construction is progressing rapidly, and the people's living standards are improving day by day. From the Chinese Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou, we saw that China's economy has developed considerably, so we believe that promoting Sino-Japanese trade is an urgent task at present.
The delegation arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou on the 29th. The head of the delegation, Akira Kazami, Chairman of the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, also told reporters from Hong Kong newspapers that the current Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government pursues a policy of recognizing the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan, and at the same time opposes New China's restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations. But this is not the case with the Japanese people. At the Japan-China Diplomatic Relations Restoration Conference held in Japan at the end of July this year, most of the people who attended the meeting accepted the call of the conference.

    日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华使节团
    表示要努力加强恢复日中邦交的活动
    新华社香港30日电　日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华使节团29日在香港发表声明说：日中两国贸易的发展、日本的独立和亚洲与世界的和平这三个问题，都要求日中两国正常邦交的恢复。为了促使日中邦交早日恢复，我们回到日本后将努力加强恢复日中邦交国民运动。
    声明说：台湾问题是中国的内政问题，我们再三强调不承认“两个中国”这个说法。
    声明又说：当我们到中国各地访问的时候，看到中国的建设进展迅速，人民生活日益提高。从广州的中国出口商品交易会上，我们看到中国的经济已有相当发展，因此我们认为促进日中贸易是当前的急务。
    这个代表团是29日从广州到达香港的。代表团团长、日本恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章还对香港报纸的记者说：目前日本岸信介政府奉行承认台湾蒋介石集团的政策，同时反对新中国恢复在联合国的合法席位。但在日本人民方面却不是这样。今年7月底在日本召开的日中邦交恢复大会上，到会的大部分人士都接受大会的号召。
