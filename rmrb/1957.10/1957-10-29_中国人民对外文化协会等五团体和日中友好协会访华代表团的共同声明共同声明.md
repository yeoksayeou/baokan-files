Joint Statement by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and Four Other Organizations, and the Delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association

The Delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations, participated in the 8th National Day of the People's Republic of China. Based on the experience of carrying out the Japan-China friendship movement in Japan over the past eight years, the delegation, together with representatives from the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and the Red Cross Society of China, held candid talks on issues such as enhancing friendship between the peoples of the two countries and normalizing Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Through these talks, the visiting delegation expressed the following opinions, which the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and related Chinese organizations agreed with and supported.

	(1) With the establishment of the People's Republic of China, China has been unified as never before in history. However, some people in the world and in Japan continue to engage in illegal conspiracies to separate Taiwan from China.
	Such actions that disrupt peace in Asia must be severely condemned. Whether it is to promote the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations or to promote cultural and economic exchanges between the two peoples, we must condemn this conspiracy to create "two Chinas," because it is not only detrimental to the peoples of China and Japan but also detrimental to maintaining world peace.

	(2) The visiting delegation witnessed the development of China's economic construction and recognized the broad prospects for economic exchanges between China and Japan. The visiting delegation confirmed that the reason hindering the development of Sino-Japanese trade lies in the domestic situation in Japan, which mainly uses the fingerprint issue as an excuse to obstruct the establishment of mutual commercial agencies. Therefore, a national movement should be strengthened in Japan to eliminate this obstacle.

	(3) In order to further strengthen the exchanges between the peoples of the two countries and cultural and technological exchanges, the visiting delegation hopes that the Chinese side will continue to invite delegations from all aspects of Japan to visit China, including delegations from local prefectures. The visiting delegation emphasized that further efforts should be made to invite delegations from all walks of life in China to visit Japan.

	(4) The visiting delegation once again expressed its respect for the Red Cross Society of China's vigorous assistance in the repatriation of Japanese nationals and Japanese war criminals who have completed their sentences in China, and stated that it would continue to work hard to fully implement the Tianjin Joint Statement signed by the Red Cross Society of China and three Japanese organizations in June 1956, and the memorandum of understanding between the advisor of the Japanese Socialist Party, Hachiro Arita, and various parties in Beijing on August 29, 1957. The Red Cross Society of China expressed that it would continue to provide assistance in the spirit of the above-mentioned documents.

	(5) The visiting delegation stated that enhancing the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan is an indispensable part of maintaining peace in the world and Asia, and stated that it would strengthen ties with the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and work to promote the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs and strengthen the unity of Asian nations.

	(6) The visiting delegation stated that the Japan-China friendship movement is a movement with political, economic, and cultural diversity based on the ardent demands of the Japanese people. Through these movements, it is believed that the friendship between the two peoples can be enhanced, internal and external obstacles can be broken down, and the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries can be realized. The Chinese side has always attached importance to this trend of the Japanese people and believes that the peaceful and friendly development of the peoples of China and Japan is of great significance for maintaining peace in Asia. The Chinese side stated that it will further strengthen ties with relevant Japanese organizations and is preparing to establish a China-Japan Friendship Association.

    中国人民对外文化协会等五团体和日中友好协会访华代表团的共同声明共同声明
    日中友好协会访华代表团应中国人民对外文化协会的邀请，参加了中华人民共和国第八届国庆节。代表团根据八年来在日本开展日中友好运动的经验，同中国人民对外文化协会，中国人民外交学会，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，中国国际贸易促进委员会，中国红十字会诸代表，就增进两国人民友谊、日中邦交正常化诸问题，进行了坦率的会谈。通过这些会谈，访华代表团表示了下列各点意见，中国人民对外文化协会以及中国方面有关团体表示同意和支持。
      （一）由于中华人民共和国的成立，中国在历史上已空前统一起来，但是，在世界和日本的一部分人中，仍有继续进行企图使台湾从中国分离的非法的阴谋活动。
    必须严厉地谴责这种扰乱亚洲和平的行动。不论是为促进日中邦交的恢复，或是为促进两国人民的文化和经济的交流，我们必须谴责这种企图制造“两个中国”的阴谋，因为它不仅对中日两国人民不利，而且对维护世界和平也是不利的。
      （二）访华代表团看到了中国经济建设的发展，认识到中日两国经济交流的远大前途。访华代表团确认妨碍日中贸易发展的原因在于日本国内情况，这种情况主要是以指纹问题为借口，阻碍互设商务机构的实现。因而在日本国内，应该加强开展国民运动，排除这种障碍。
      （三）为进一步加强两国人民间的往来和文化技术交流，访华代表团希望中国方面继续邀请日本各方面代表团访华，包括地方都道府县代表团在内。访华代表团强调了应该进一步努力邀请中国各界代表团访日。
      （四）访华代表团对于中国红十字会大力协助在华日侨及刑满的日本战犯归国，再次表示敬意，并且表示要继续努力使1956年6月中国红十字会和日本三团体签订的天津共同声明，以及1957年8月29日日本社会党顾问有田八郎在北京同各方面会谈的备忘录的内容全面地实现，中国红十字会表示将本上述文件的精神继续予以协助。
      （五）访华代表团表示，增进日中两国人民的友谊是维护世界和亚洲的和平不可缺少的一部分，并且表示要同中国人民保卫世界和平委员会加强联系，为促进禁止原子弹氢弹，加强亚洲各民族的团结而努力。
      （六）访华代表团表示，日中友好运动是根据日本人民热烈要求的具有政治、经济、文化各方面多样性的运动。通过这些运动，确信可以增进两国人民的友谊，打破内外的障碍，进而实现两国邦交的正常化。中国方面历来重视日本人民这种动向，并且认为，中日两国人民和平友好的发展，对于维护亚洲和平有着重要的作用。中国方面表示，将进一步加强与日本各有关团体的联系，并且准备成立中日友好协会。
