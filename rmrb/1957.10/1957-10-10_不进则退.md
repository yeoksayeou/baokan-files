    Not Advancing is Retreating
    Yi Huai
    There is an old Chinese saying: "Sailing against the current, not advancing is retreating." At present, most middle-of-the-road bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals are precisely in this situation.
    However, when faced with the question of whether to advance or retreat, there are also many who plan to neither advance nor retreat, but to find a harbor for their small boats where they can avoid wind and waves. According to reports, some intellectuals in Shanghai agencies are not interested in important articles and news about the anti-Rightist struggle published in newspapers and magazines, and after work they indulge in comic books to escape reality.
    For some people, "advancing" and "retreating" are indeed difficult choices. Retreating would mean being associated with the Rightists who have been spurned by the people of the whole country; advancing would mean declaring war on the bourgeois kingdom in their hearts, and declaring war on those Rightists. And these people were yesterday their close friends, and there are still countless emotional ties between them. The determination and courage needed to fight them is indeed not small. Therefore, they want to protect themselves by being worldly wise and playing safe, and stop where they are.
    Facts have proven that attempting to neither advance nor retreat is completely impossible. Those who do not want to advance against the current, even if they drop anchor and stop their small boats, will be left further and further behind as the revolutionary tide continues to advance. Not to mention the impact of the revolutionary tide, even the thoughts of those who want to neither advance nor retreat cannot be static. Is it possible for a person to express willingness to accept the leadership of the Party and take the socialist road, while at the same time maintaining an infinite attachment to capitalism in the depths of their hearts, and for socialism and capitalism to "peacefully coexist" in one person's mind? In fact, it is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. When the Rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, many middle-of-the-road elements once showed serious Rightist tendencies, sympathizing with the Rightists, supporting the Rightists, and even acting as their tools, doubting and wavering about the Party's leadership and socialism. And when the anti-Rightist struggle deepened, many middle-of-the-road elements were shocked and slowly awakened, began to draw a line between themselves and the Rightists, and leaned to the left. In the great storms of socialist political revolution and ideological revolution, isn't the rapid political and ideological differentiation of middle-of-the-road elements to the left or to the right a manifestation of their "retreating if they don't advance" in "sailing against the current"?
    Those who indulge in "comic books" and escape struggle and transformation in other ways, when they wake up, will find that their former companions have already taken big strides ahead of them. If they want to catch up with this team again at this time, they will have to pay a higher price!

    不进则退
    易槐
    我国有句古话：“逆水行舟，不进则退”。目前大多数中间状态的资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子就正处于这种境况之中。
    可是，面临着是进是退的问题的时候，打算既不进又不退，给自己的小船找一个可以躲避风浪的港口的，却也大有人在。据报载，上海有些机关里的知识分子，对报纸刊物上登载的有关反右派斗争的重要文章和新闻不感兴趣，下班以后沉缅在小人书连环画中去逃避现实。
    对于有些人来说，“进”、“退”的确两难。退吧，耻与那些已为全国人民所唾弃的右派分子为伍；进吧，就必须和自己心灵深处的那个资产阶级王国宣战，就要和那些右派分子宣战。而这些人昨天还是自己推心置腹的朋友，在思想感情上相互之间还有千丝万缕的联系，要同他们进行战斗，所需要的决心和勇气的确是不小的。于是，他们就想明哲保身，停在原处不动。
    事实已经证明：企图不进又不退，是完全不可能的。不想逆水前进的人，即使把自己的小船抛锚停下，可是革命浪潮不断前进，也就越来越远的把小船甩在后面了。不说革命浪潮的冲击，就是想要不进又不退的人自己的思想，也不可能是静止不动的。一个人一方面表示愿意接受党的领导走社会主义的道路；一方面又要在自己的心灵深处保持着对资本主义的无限留恋，要社会主义和资本主义在一个人的脑袋里“和平共居”，这是可能的吗？事实上，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风。当右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，许多中间分子一度表现严重右倾，同情右派分子，支持右派分子，甚至充当他们的工具，对党的领导对社会主义发生怀疑和动摇。而当反右派斗争日益深入的时候，不少中间分子才大吃一惊慢慢清醒，开始和右派划分界限，向左靠拢。在社会主义政治革命和思想革命的大风浪中，中间分子政治上思想上这样急剧的向左或向右分化，不正是他们在“逆水行舟”中“不进则退”的表现吗？
    那些沉缅在“小人书”、“连环画”以及用其他方式逃避斗争逃避改造的人们，当他们一觉醒来的时候，就会发现，往日的伙伴，已经大踏步的走在自己前面了，这时候再想追上这支队伍，就要付出更多的代价了！
