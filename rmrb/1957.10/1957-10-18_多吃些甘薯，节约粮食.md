Local Newspaper Commentary Excerpts

　　Eat More Sweet Potatoes, Save Grain
    Shanghai Liberation Daily published an editorial on the 8th of this month entitled "Everyone Eat Some Sweet Potatoes, Save Staple Grain" (Note: People in Shanghai call sweet potatoes "mountain taro"). The editorial stated: Shanghai currently has a population of over seven million, and the total food grain and grain used by various industries consumes around 230 million jin per month, averaging about 32 jin per person per month. Whether it is a bumper year or a lean year, the state must transport such a large amount of grain from all directions across the country to supply Shanghai. It can be said that the farmer brothers across the country have made great efforts to support Shanghai's production. Now is the season when sweet potatoes are being marketed in large quantities in rural areas. If we can eat a small amount of sweet potatoes to replace staple grains such as rice and flour in the next two or three months, it will not only be a strong support for farmers, but will also save the city tens of millions of jin of staple grain. This will be beneficial to reducing some of the state's burden and increasing the state's grain reserves.
    The editorial stated that many right-wing elements exaggerate the lives of urban and rural areas into a stark contrast between heaven and hell, attempting to use this to undermine the unified purchase and sale of grain and to undermine the worker-peasant alliance. The further development of urban grain conservation efforts by urban residents, using some coarse grains to replace some staple grains, will eliminate misunderstandings among farmers who do not understand the situation, which will help consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.
    In a large city like Shanghai, is it possible to get everyone to eat some sweet potatoes within a certain period? The editorial believes it is possible. First of all, a large proportion of Shanghai residents have the habit of eating sweet potatoes along with staple grains. If everyone eats a portion of sweet potatoes, it can not only diversify food varieties but also save staple grains for the country. Therefore, this matter can also be welcomed by the vast majority of residents. Secondly, there are approximately one thousand canteens of varying sizes throughout the city. In implementing the unified sales system and responding to the call for saving grain, they have always been the model for residents throughout the city. They should also continue to provide an example for residents throughout the city with their exemplary behavior in reducing staple grain consumption and promoting eating more sweet potatoes. Thirdly, public restaurants and stalls can also expand the sales of sweet potatoes and save staple grains to some extent, with the willing cooperation of consumers, by improving services and increasing variety. Finally, and most importantly, a city-wide political and ideological socialist revolution is unfolding in depth, and the socialist enthusiasm of the people of the city is being further heightened. As long as the principles are explained clearly and the organizational work is done well, we are fully capable of saving a considerable amount of staple grain in the next two or three months. The editorial stated that it is a good thing for urban residents to eat some sweet potatoes and save grain, but simple mandatory allocation should not be adopted when supplying sweet potatoes. It is necessary to educate people throughout the city through various channels to make them aware of the positive significance of this matter and consciously cooperate with the grain department.

### 多吃些甘薯，节约粮食

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

　　多吃些甘薯，节约粮食
    上海解放日报本月8日以“大家吃些山芋，节约主粮”为题发表社论（按：上海人把甘薯叫做山芋）。社论说：上海现有人口在七百万以上，全部口粮和各种行业用粮每月要消费二亿三千万斤上下，每人每月平均消费大约三十二斤。不论是丰年还是歉年，国家都须要从全国四面八方调运如此大量的粮食来供应上海，全国的农民兄弟对于支持上海的生产可说是尽了很大的力量。现在正是农村山芋大量上市的季节，如果我们在今后两、三个月里，每人能吃少量的山芋来代替大米、面粉等主粮，不仅对农民是一种有力的支持，而且将使全市节约出几千万斤主粮。这对于减轻国家一部分负担和增加国家的粮食储备，都会有好处。
    社论说，许多右派分子把城市和农村的生活夸大成为天堂和地狱的悬殊，企图借此来破坏粮食的统购统销，破坏工农联盟。城市居民进一步地开展城市节约粮食的工作，用一部分粗粮来代替一部分主粮，将使一般不了解情况的农民消除误解，这就有利于巩固工农联盟。
    在上海这样一个大城市里，是不是有可能在一定时期内做到大家吃些山芋呢？社论认为是有可能的。首先，在上海居民中，很大一部分人有用主粮搭吃山芋的习惯，如果大家吃一部分山芋，既能调剂食用品种，又为国家节约出主粮。因此，这件事情也是能够受到绝大多数居民欢迎的。其次，全市大约有一千个左右规模不等的伙食团，在执行统销制度和响应节约用粮的行动中，从来是全市居民的表率，他们应该也可以在减少主粮消耗、提倡多吃山芋的号召下，继续以自己的模范行为为全市居民提供榜样。第三，公共饮食店、摊，用改进服务和增多花色的办法，在消费者乐意合作的前提下，也可以扩大一部分山芋的销售，节约一部分主粮。最后，也是最重要的，便是全市性的一场政治上思想上的社会主义革命正在深入展开，全市人民的社会主义热情正在进一步高涨，只要把道理讲清楚，把组织工作做好，我们是完全有可能在今后两、三个月里节约出不少主粮来的。社论说，让城市居民吃些山芋，节约粮食，这是一件好事情，但是在供应山芋的时候，不应该采取简单的强命摊派的作法。必须通过各方面的宣传教育，使全市人民认识这件事情的积极意义，而自觉地同粮食部门合作。
