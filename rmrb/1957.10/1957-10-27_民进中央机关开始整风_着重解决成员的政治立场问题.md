Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: The Central Rectification Leadership Group of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) has decided to launch a rectification movement among the cadres of the CAPD Central Committee, starting immediately, focusing on rectifying their political stance. This was announced by Ge Zhicheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the CAPD Central Committee, at a meeting of all cadres of the CAPD Central Committee on the 24th.

Ge Zhicheng delivered a mobilization report for the rectification campaign at the meeting. He said that most members of the CAPD are bourgeois intellectuals, and in order to carry out essential transformation, it is first necessary to resolve the political stance of each individual. Therefore, this rectification campaign should be used to correct our stance, transform ourselves, break down the capitalist stance, and establish a socialist stance. At the same time, the rectification campaign should be used to overcome shortcomings in our work and rectify our work style.

Wu Rong, Director of the General Office of the CAPD Central Committee, announced the work plan for the rectification campaign at the meeting. According to the plan, the rectification of the CAPD Central Committee organs will be carried out in stages: studying necessary documents, rectifying political stances, fully airing views, and conducting debates; offering as many opinions as possible on the work of the organs and the work style of leading cadres, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism; at the same time, administrative leaders should implement the spirit of rectifying while correcting, and conduct in-depth and systematic concrete analysis of the opinions and problems raised. Deficiencies in work systems will be studied and improved in a focused manner, striving to ensure that every item is accounted for and every matter is resolved.

The rectification is scheduled to last two and a half months and will end at the end of December.

    民进中央机关开始整风
    着重解决成员的政治立场问题
    新华社25日讯　中国民主促进会中央整风领导小组决定自即日起在民进中央机关干部中开始进行以端正政治立场为主要内容的整风运动。这是民进中央副秘书长葛志成在24日召开的民进中央机关全体干部大会上宣布的。
    葛志成在会上作了整风的动员报告。他说，民进大多数成员是资产阶级知识分子，要进行本质改造，首先要解决每个人的政治立场问题。因此，要通过这次整风来端正立场，改造自己，破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场。同时，要通过整风来克服工作中的缺点，整顿工作作风。
    民进中央办公厅主任吴荣在会上宣布了整风工作计划。按照计划，民进中央机关的整风将分阶段进行：学习必要文件，端正政治立场，充分鸣放，进行辩论；对机关工作，对领导干部的工作作风，尽量提出意见，开展批评和自我批评；同时，行政领导上要贯彻边整边改的精神，对提出的意见和问题要深入地系统地进行具体分析，对工作制度上的缺点，集中加以研究改进，务求做到件件有交代，桩桩有着落。
    整风的时间预定两个半月，将在12月底结束。
