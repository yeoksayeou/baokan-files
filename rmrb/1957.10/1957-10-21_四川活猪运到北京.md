    Sichuan Live Pigs Transported to Beijing

    The Sichuan Provincial Food Company recently test-transported a large batch of live pigs to Zhengzhou and Beijing via the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. They arrived safely and smoothly at their destinations, with very few deaths along the way.

    Sichuan pigs are known for their thick fat and high oil content, and their production accounts for one-fifth of the country's total hog production. Currently, the Sichuan Provincial Food Company is stepping up efforts to organize sources of live pigs, and by the end of this year, it is estimated that more than 40,000 fat pigs will be transported from the Baoji-Chengdu Railway to Zhengzhou and Beijing.
