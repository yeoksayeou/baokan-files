    The Old Mining Area's Youth
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo

    A tall high-voltage power line stretches from Xi'an across the rushing Wei River to the Weibei Plain. Its end is at the Tongchuan Mining Area, one of the coal mining bases that grew up during the First Five-Year Plan.

    This is an ancient mining area. According to historical records, as early as the Song Dynasty, the pottery workers here used coal exposed on the ground as fuel for firing porcelain. Now, under the ruins of the Song Dynasty city near Huangbao Town, piles of Song Dynasty porcelain and coal slag left over from firing porcelain can still be unearthed. From the Yuan and Ming dynasties onwards, coal mining production here further developed, and miners began to build deep shafts to mine coal. Now, among the hundreds of abandoned small mines, some ancient mines dating back hundreds of years can still be found.

    After 1928, the Geological Research Institute of the Kuomintang government and the pseudo-Shaanxi Provincial Department of Construction sent people to survey the coalfields in this area. After about twenty years, they only investigated the general geological conditions of the coalfields and put forward construction data for less than 60 million tons. Subsequently, bureaucratic capital extended into this mining area and built the "Tongguan" Coal Mine. Until before liberation, the mining period had been long enough, but the appearance of this mining area was still very backward. The entire mining area did not even have a small power plant, almost all coal mining was done manually, and coal production had been stagnating at around a few hundred thousand tons.

    After liberation, the People's Government sent people to take over the "Tongguan" Coal Mine run by bureaucratic capital, drove away those feudal foremen who committed all kinds of evils, and liberated the miners from the oppression and exploitation of bureaucratic capital and feudal foremen. At the same time, a large amount of funds was invested to restore and develop production. In 1952, coal production here more than doubled the pre-liberation output. From 1953, the state designated the Tongchuan Mining Area as one of the key coal mining bases, and sent a large number of exploration, construction workers, and technical personnel to carry out large-scale construction of this ancient mining area. In just over four years, Tongchuan has shed its backward appearance and become one of the largest coal mining bases in Northwest China. Its annual output has increased from a few hundred thousand tons in the past to nearly one million tons.

    The old miners still remember the backward situation in the mining area before liberation: none of the more than one hundred small mines in the entire mining area had mechanical equipment, and everything was done manually; some mines, due to the difficulty of hoisting, feudal foremen forced workers to live underground, some lived underground for a month, and some had to live for half a year. In addition, there were frequent accidents such as fires, floods, and roof collapses, and the lives of the miners were not guaranteed at all. Now the situation has fundamentally changed. In the past four years, the state has rebuilt the First and Third Mines, and the annual output has increased from tens of thousands of tons to 250,000 tons and 300,000 tons respectively; the newly built mines include the Sanlidong Vertical Shaft (annual output of 600,000 tons), the Wangjiahe No. 1 Mine (annual output of 210,000 tons) and the Taoyuan Horizontal Adit (annual output of 900,000 tons). Among them, the First and Third Mines and the Sanlidong Vertical Shaft have been put into production. These rebuilt and newly built mines all have a large number of mechanized equipment, and underground facilities such as ventilation, fire prevention, flood control, communication, and lighting are installed, which ensures both high output and safe production. The Sanlidong Vertical Shaft, which was put into production on July 1st this year, was designed by Chinese technicians who absorbed the latest Soviet mine construction experience. Its degree of mechanization and automation can be compared with that of the Northeast Ping'an Vertical Shaft. Workers in each roadway use combine harvesters to mine tons of coal, load it on chain conveyors, which transport it to the main transportation roadway, automatically load it into mine cars, and then transport it to the underground station by locomotive, and automatically load it into the coal bunker. Hoisting is done with a skip driven by a new type of electric winch, which can lift three tons each time, and can lift more than 2,300 tons in fourteen hours. After the skip lifts the coal up, it automatically dumps it into the coal bunker at the wellhead; the reciprocating feeder of the coal bunker then loads the coal onto the belt conveyor, transports it to the coal preparation plant, and automatically divides it into four grades according to industrial needs (according to block size), and then automatically loads it onto the train for transportation. The ventilation, flood control, fire prevention and other equipment of this vertical shaft are also modern. The ventilation system can supply each underground worker with four cubic meters of fresh air per minute.

    These mines are only part of the Tongchuan construction plan, and many new mines will be built successively in the future. At present, the Chenjiahe Inclined Shaft with an annual output of 210,000 tons, the Wangshi'ao Vertical Shaft with an annual output of 1.2 million tons, and the rebuilt Xinhua Mine (annual output of 150,000 tons) are under construction. The Qiaoziliang, Jinhuashan and other mines will begin construction next year. After these mines are put into production, the annual coal output of this mining area will increase to more than 5.7 million tons, becoming one of the largest coal mining bases in my country.

    With the development of construction, Tongchuan, a small county town dominated by miners, has also been built into a new type of mining town. In the past, the population here was less than 20,000, and most of the houses were dilapidated adobe houses and earth cave dwellings. Now, the population here has increased to 60,000 to 70,000. In this mining town surrounded by mountains and rivers, new buildings have appeared. Power plants, central mining machinery repair plants, and mine prop factories that serve the mine have been built. Several special railway lines leading to the mine, some of which have been built, and some are under construction. In the future, a marshalling station will also be built.

    Great changes have taken place in the Tongchuan Mining Area in the past few years, but this is just a beginning. With the successive completion of dozens of large factories on both sides of the Wei River, this ancient and young mining area will have greater development and make greater contributions to the motherland.

    老矿区的青春
    本报记者　朱波
    一条高大的高压输电线，从西安越过湍急的渭河，伸向渭北平原。它的尽头，就是在第一个五年计划期间成长起来的煤矿基地之一——铜川矿区。
    这是一个古老的矿区。根据历史记载，早在宋朝，这里的陶瓷工人就用露出地面的煤作烧瓷的燃料。现在，在黄堡镇附近的宋代城市的遗址下，还可以挖出一堆堆的宋瓷和烧瓷剩下的煤渣。从元朝，明朝起，这里的煤矿生产有了进一步的发展，矿工们开始建筑深井来采煤。现在，在数以百计的荒废了的小型矿井中，还可以找出一些数百年前的古老矿井。
    1928年以后，国民党政府的地质研究所和伪陕西省建设厅都曾派人对这一带的煤田进行过勘察。经过二十年左右的时间，他们只调查了一般的煤田地质情况，提出了不到六千万吨的建井资料。随着，官僚资本伸入这个矿区，建设了“同官”煤矿。直到解放以前，开采的年代已经够长久的了，但是这个矿区的面貌仍然十分落后。整个矿区连一个小型的发电厂都没有，几乎全部是人工采煤，煤的产量也一直停留在十几万吨左右。
    解放以后，人民政府派人接收了官僚资本开办的“同官”煤矿，赶走了那些为非作歹的封建把头，把矿工从官僚资本和封建把头的压迫剥削下解放出来。同时，投入了大量资金，恢复和发展生产。1952年，这里的煤产量就超过解放前产量一倍以上。从1953年开始，国家把铜川矿区作为重点煤矿基地之一，派来大批勘探、基建工人和技术人员，对这个古老的矿区进行了大规模的建设。仅仅四年多的时间，铜川就摆脱了落后的面貌，成为西北最大的煤矿基地之一。它的年产量由过去的十几万吨，提高到近百万吨。
    年老的矿工都还记得解放前矿区落后的情景：整个矿区的一百多个小型矿井，都没有机械设备，一切都使用人力；有些矿井由于提升困难，封建把头强迫工人住在井下，有的在井下住一个月，有的要住半年。加上经常发生失火、水淹、塌顶等事故，矿工的生命没有一点保障。现在情况根本改变。四年多来，国家改建了第一、第三两个矿井，年产量分别由几万吨提高到二十五万吨和三十万吨；新建的矿井，有三里洞竖井
  （年产六十万吨）、王家河一号井（年产二十一万吨）和桃园平峒（年产九十万吨）。其中第一、三矿井和三里洞竖井已经投入生产。这些改建、新建的矿井，都拥有大量机械化设备，井下装置了通风、防火、防水、通讯和照明等设施，产量既高，生产又很安全。今年7 月1日投入生产的三里洞竖井，就是我国技术人员吸收苏联最新的矿井建设经验设计的。它的机械化自动化程度可以同东北平安竖井媲美。各个坑道的工人用康拜因把成吨的煤采下来，装在链板运输机上，由链板运输机运到总运输大坑道里，自动装进矿车，然后由机车运到井下车场，并且自动装进煤仓。提升是用新型电绞车带动着的箕斗，每次可提升三吨，十四小时可提升二千三百多吨。箕斗把煤提升上来以后，就自动倾倒进井口煤仓；煤仓的往复给煤机又把煤装到皮带运输机上，运到选煤厂，按照工业需要（按块大小），自动分成四级，然后自动装上火车运出去。这个竖井的通风、防水、防火等设备也是近代化的。通风系统，每分钟就可以供应井下职工每人四立方新鲜空气。
    这些矿井不过是铜川建设计划中的一部分项目，今后还将有许多新矿井陆续建成。目前，已经动工建设的有年产二十一万吨的陈家河斜井，有年产一百二十万吨的王石凹竖井，还有改建的（年产十五万吨）新华矿井等。明年开始兴建的将有桥子梁、金华山等矿井。这批矿井投入生产以后，这个矿区煤的年产量将增加到五百七十万吨以上，成为我国最大的煤矿基地之一。
    随着建设的发展，铜川这个以矿工为主的小县城，也建成了一个新型的矿工城。过去，这里人口不到两万，房屋大部是破旧的土坯房和土窑洞。现在，这里的人口已经增加到六、七万。在这座丛山环抱、河水围绕的矿工城里，已经出现了新的楼房。为矿山服务的发电厂、中央矿山机械修理厂和矿山支架厂等已经建设起来。几条通向矿山的铁路专用线，有的已经建成，有的正在修建。将来，还要修建编组车站。
    这几年，铜川矿区发生了极大的变化，但是这也不过是一个开端。随着渭河两岸几十座大工厂的陆续建成，这个古老而年青的矿区还将有更大的发展，还将为祖国作出更大的贡献。（附图片）
