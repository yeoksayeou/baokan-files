    ——Introducing the "Exhibition of Photographs and Gifts from the Chinese Cultural Delegation's Visit to Nepal"——
    The "Exhibition of Photographs and Gifts from the Chinese Cultural Delegation's Visit to Nepal," held to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the China-Nepal Friendship Association, opened on September 28th in Beihai Park. The more than two hundred photographs and more than one hundred gifts presented by the Nepalese hosts are precious records of the friendship between the people of China and Nepal.
    The Chinese Cultural Delegation, a group of nineteen people led by head of delegation Chu Tunan, arrived in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, on June 13th of this year at the invitation of the Nepalese government. The first section of the exhibition features a group of pictures showing the grand occasion of the warm and friendly welcome received upon the delegation's arrival. After the delegation arrived, they were received that afternoon by then-Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya and the King and Queen, respectively. These situations are introduced in a group of photos in the second section of the exhibition.
    The photographs separately introduce the beautiful scenery and religiously significant historical sites visited by the delegation in Nepal's three major cities. Kathmandu, located at the confluence of the Bagmati and Bishnumati rivers, means "City of Glory" in Sanskrit. It is the main valley of Nepal, with a population of approximately 300,000. A green lawn in the city center called "East Tundikhel" is Asia's largest parade and gathering square; the photos introduce a corner of it. The photos also introduce the opening of the Kathmandu Valley, said to have been cut open by the Chinese Buddhist master Manjushri, and the Manjushri Bodhisattva Temple built by him, towering on the high mountains. Also included are the Shiva Temple, built two thousand years ago, and the reclining Vishnu stone statue in the pond, covered in countless snake carvings.
    Lalitpur, about three kilometers southeast of Kathmandu, also known as Patan, is Asia's famous Buddhist cultural center, with many ancient Buddhist sites, unique architecture, and extremely exquisite carving craftsmanship. The photos introduce the famous Lalitpur City Palace Square, the gilded three-tiered pagoda roof, and the intricately carved stone old palace.
    Bhaktapur, about ten kilometers east of Kathmandu, is the third largest city in Nepal, with many beautiful temples. The photos introduce the city's palace square. The delegation visited the "Golden Gate Palace" located in the center of the square, which has fifty-five windows with various decorations, displaying excellent craftsmanship, as well as Nepal's highest Nyatapola Temple. The delegation received a warm welcome during their visits to these cities, with cheers, flowers, and garlands everywhere. The residents marked the representatives' foreheads with auspicious red dots with the most solemn religious ceremonies, and scattered precious cinnabar powder. The Manjushri Bodhisattva Temple specially performed the Five Buddha Dance and Lama Devil Dance from the festival for the representatives. Lalitpur also performed wonderful dances. Bhaktapur even organized a large-scale open-air performance, allowing the representatives to see the city's unique classical dance.
    The photos also introduce the delegation's participation in welcome receptions held by government officials and people's organizations, as well as the moving scenes of visiting Nepalese literary, educational, and academic groups.
    The photos also introduce some of the literary and artistic performances arranged and organized by the Nepalese hosts for the delegation. The most unique was the literary and artistic performance in the woods behind the Shital Niwas Palace, using the natural environment as the stage and backdrop. The mythical and dreamlike atmosphere made the performance particularly outstanding.
    During its visit to Nepal, the Chinese Cultural Delegation also held film receptions, screening color films such as "Joyful Songs and Dances," which were warmly welcomed by the Nepalese people. The delegation also jointly held a week-long Sino-Nepalese art and crafts exhibition with the Nepalese government. Chinese arts and crafts received extremely high praise and appreciation from the Nepalese people, and Nepalese artists even replicated some works based on the exhibits. The three exhibition rooms were crowded with visitors every day. The King and Queen also visited the exhibition on the eve of its closing and left comments of praise.
    The farewell banquet given by head of delegation Chu Tunan before the delegation's departure and the farewell banquet given by then-Education Minister Sharma are introduced in the photos in the last part of the exhibition. In the latter banquet, the wonderful performances by Nepalese dancers and the grand parade of over a thousand people specially organized for the delegation outside, leaving a deeper impression on people.
    The various gifts received by the delegation during its visit to Nepal showed the exquisite art and craftsmanship of Nepal, and even more symbolized the friendship between the people of China and Nepal. The gifts in the exhibition included oil portraits of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou presented by the King of Nepal, as well as some traditional gilded kas and gemstone-inlaid silverware and bronzeware, sabers, and soft blankets and printed bedding. There were also precious Buddhist scriptures and pagoda models presented by the Manjushri Bodhisattva Temple, as well as pictures of Premier Zhou's visit to Nepal; exquisite "beaded flowers" presented by the Women's Voluntary Service. In addition, there were greeting messages presented by various Nepalese groups, as well as Nepalese ethnic shoes, hats, musical instruments, wood carvings, clay sculptures, handicrafts, and books and periodicals.

    ——介绍“中国文化代表团访问尼泊尔照片和礼品展览”——
    为庆祝中国尼泊尔友好协会成立一周年而举办的“中国文化代表团访问尼泊尔照片和礼品展览”，已于9月28日在北海公园开始展出。展出的二百多张照片和一百多件尼泊尔主人赠送的礼品，是中国和尼泊尔两国人民友谊的珍贵记录。
    中国文化代表团一行十九人应尼泊尔政府的邀请，在团长楚图南率领下，于今年6月13日到达尼泊尔首都加德满都进行访问。展览中第一版的一组图片表现了代表团在到达时受到热情而友好的欢迎的盛况。代表团到达以后，当天下午受到了当时尼泊尔首相阿查里雅和国王、王后的分别接见。这些情况在展览中第二版的一组照片中作了介绍。
    照片分别介绍了代表团参观过的尼泊尔三大城市的优美风光和具有宗教色彩的古迹名胜。加德满都位于巴格马蒂和毕士努马蒂两河汇合处，在梵语中的意思是“光荣之城”。它是尼泊尔的主要谷地，人口约三十万。市中心一块称为“东底克尔”的绿茵草地是亚洲最大的阅兵和集会广场，照片介绍了它的一隅。照片还介绍了相传为中国文殊法师砍开的加德满都河谷开口处，以及由他修建的耸立在高山上的文殊菩萨寺。两千年前就已修建的湿婆神塔，和仰卧在池中、身上有无数蛇雕的毗舍奴石神像等。
    距加德满都东南约三公里的拉立特普城，又名巴丹，是亚洲闻名的佛教文化中心，佛教古迹很多，建筑别具风格，雕刻工艺极为精致。照片介绍了著名的拉立特普城宫殿广场、镀金的三层塔顶和石雕精细的旧王宫等。
    距加德满都以东约十公里的巴克塔普城，是尼泊尔第三大城市，优美的庙塔很多。照片介绍了该城的宫殿广场。代表团曾访问过位于广场中央有五十五个各种不同装饰的窗户、显示了卓越工艺技术的“金门皇宫”，以及尼泊尔最高的涅阿达普拉寺等。代表团在这些城市参观时受到了热烈的欢迎，到处是欢呼，到处是鲜花和花环。居民们以宗教上最隆重的仪式为代表们在眉宇间点以吉祥的红痣，掷撒贵重的朱砂粉。文殊菩萨庙特为代表们表演了节日里的五佛舞和喇嘛跳鬼舞。拉立特普城也表演了精彩的舞蹈。巴格特普城更组织了规模宏大的露天表演，使代表们看到了该城特有的古典舞蹈。
    照片也介绍了代表团参加各政府官员、人民团体的欢迎招待会的情况，以及参观访问尼泊尔文教学术团体机构的动人场面。
    照片还介绍了尼泊尔主人为代表团安排和组织的一些文艺演出。最为别致的是在清凉宫后面的树林里以自然环境为舞台和背景的文艺演出，神化梦幻似的气氛使演出特别出色。
    中国文化代表团在访尼期间还举办了电影招待会，放映了“欢乐的歌舞”等彩色片，受到尼泊尔人民热烈的欢迎。代表团还与尼泊尔政府联合举行了为期一周的尼中艺术和工艺品展览会，中国的工艺美术品受到了尼泊尔人民的极高评价和赞赏，尼泊尔的艺术家还根据展品复制了一些作品。在三间展览室中每天都挤满了观众。国王和王后也在闭幕前夕参观了展览会并留下了赞语。
    代表团临别前的楚图南团长告别宴会和当时的教育大臣夏尔马欢送宴会，在展览最后部分的图片中作了介绍。在后一次宴会中，尼泊尔舞蹈家们的精彩表演和在室外特为代表团组织的千余人庙会奉神大游行，更给人们留下了深刻的印象。
    代表团在访尼期间所收到的各种礼品，显示了尼泊尔精美的美术工艺，更象征了中尼两国人民之间的友谊。在展览中的礼品包括尼泊尔国王赠送给毛主席和周总理的油画像，和一些传统的镀金卡丝和宝石镶嵌的银器和铜器、佩刀，以及柔软的毛毯、印花被褥。还有文殊菩萨寺赠送的珍贵佛经、佛塔模型和周总理访问尼泊尔的图片；妇女志愿服务社赠送的精致“珠花”。此外还有尼泊尔各团体赠送的贺词以及尼泊尔民族鞋、帽、乐器、木雕泥塑手工艺品和书刊等。
