	Traveling southeast by car from Bengbu on the banks of the Huai River, it takes only forty minutes to reach Fengyang County. Speaking of Fengyang, one immediately thinks of the Fengyang Flower-Drum song: "Speaking of Fengyang, talking of Fengyang, Fengyang was originally a good place, but ever since Zhu Hongwu emerged, nine out of ten years have been barren." Historically, the farmers of Fengyang have always been intertwined with hunger and tears of blood.

	Fengyang once served as a prefectural capital, governing counties such as Huaiyuan, Dingyuan, Shou, Lingbi, and Su. In the gazetteer of Fengyang Prefecture, the descriptions of disasters are shocking. For example, records of droughts state: "The Huai River dries up, well springs run dry, there is no green grass in the fields, and people migrate on the roads." "Locusts fly, blocking out the sun, the year is one of great famine, and people eat each other." Records of floods state: "The Yellow River breaches its banks, all crops are submerged, all counties north of the Huai become a vast expanse of water, the water is more than ten feet deep, and countless homes are destroyed." "Fengyang suffers a great famine, and rice costs a thousand coins per斗." Under the feudal dynasties, and the Kuomintang rule was no better. In 1938, the reactionary Kuomintang rulers breached the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou in Henan Province, and the surging yellow water rushed straight into the plains north of the Huai River, claiming the lives and property of millions of people. Since then, due to the siltation of the Yellow River, all drainage systems have been destroyed, and the vast number of farmers have begun to live a miserable life of "major floods in heavy rains, minor floods in light rains, and droughts when there is no rain."

	Today's Fengyang has changed greatly. Along the way, we saw cooking smoke from farmhouses, city walls in the setting sun, and golden wheat stacks piled high. Agricultural cooperative members are happily harvesting autumn crops, a scene of complete abundance. A responsible comrade from the Fengyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party told reporters that the wheat harvest in the areas along the Huai River this year has been universally bountiful. The yield is 10%-15% higher than the abundant year of 1955. The rice yield has also exceeded last year.

	In the years since liberation, thanks to the vigorous management of the Huai River, the construction of farmland water conservancy projects, and the gradual completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, agricultural production in Fengyang County has now developed at an unprecedentedly rapid pace. The county's cultivated land area has increased by about 100,000 mu compared to the early days of liberation, and the total grain output in the county in 1956 increased by 76% compared to the early days of liberation. The nationally famous Fengyang tobacco has an annual total output of 170,000 dan, an increase of more than 32% compared to 1952. The lives of most of Fengyang County's poor peasants have now risen to the level of middle peasants.

	The life of displacement and wandering that farmers experienced before liberation is gone forever. Before liberation, in years of severe disaster, farmers fled in droves, and Fengyang County sometimes had only a dozen or so people. Today, the county's population has increased to 400,000. Li Guokun, the young director of the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative, will never forget the miserable life he spent as a child. At that time, he followed his parents, begging for food and wandering to Hunan Province; his mother drowned, his sister was given away, his family was broken, and he finally returned to his hometown after many twists and turns. In the years after liberation, he joined the agricultural cooperative, production improved, and his life greatly improved. Now, his younger brother has graduated from elementary school, his father is healthy and working in the cooperative, and he himself has married and had children, and his whole family is living a very happy life. The changes in the life of Wang Kaiyun, a 55-year-old member of this cooperative, are also typical. Before liberation, he and his wife did heavy labor and begged for food for more than twenty years. In the years after liberation, their lives have rapidly improved to nearly the level of middle peasants. In the past, they lived in dilapidated temples with their children, but now they live in three tall new thatched houses, plus a kitchen. Not only do they have cotton quilts, but they also have palm beds and mosquito nets. In the past, they wore "flowered hats on their heads and Bagua clothes (many patches) on their bodies," but now everyone in the family has several sets of clothes, and the son even wears khaki and poplin clothes. His son followed them begging from an early age, but after liberation he also studied and graduated from high school, and now he participates in agricultural production and is married.

	I also visited the Randeng Temple Township in this county. This township is the birthplace of the "Fengyang Flower-Drum." Almost every woman in the village can play the flower-drum and sing ditties. However, before liberation, when they went out to play the drum and sing for a living, they did so with tears mixed with laughter, enduring all kinds of insults and harm to earn a meager living. Today, however, flower-drum ditties have become an indispensable form of cultural entertainment for farmers. I spent an evening in the Xiangshan Agricultural Cooperative. When the stars filled the sky, young girls and young men sang on the ground. They sang more than a hundred different tunes. However, they no longer sing old tunes such as "Young Girl Hanging Herself" or "Young Widow Visiting the Grave," but rather "Encouraging the Husband to Join the Army," "Selling Surplus Grain," and "Thanking the Communist Party."

### 今昔凤阳

    今昔凤阳
    新华社记者　李明回
    从淮河边上的蚌埠乘汽车东南行，只要四十分钟的时间就到了凤阳县城。提起凤阳，就会想起凤阳花鼓来：“说凤阳，道凤阳，凤阳本是个好地方，自从出了朱洪武，十年倒有九年荒。”凤阳的农民在历史上一直是和饥饿、血泪交织在一起的。
    凤阳曾设过府治，辖怀远、定远、寿县、灵璧、宿县等县。在凤阳府志上，关于灾情的叙述是触目惊心的。如记载旱灾时说：“淮河竭，井泉枯，野无青草，流徙载道。”“蝗飞蔽日，岁大饥，人相食。”记载水灾时说：“黄河决，禾尽淹没，淮北诸县一片汪洋，水深丈余，民房冲毁无算。”“凤阳大饥，斗米千钱。”封建王朝如此，国民党统治时期并不比封建王朝更好一些。1938年，国民党反动统治者在河南省花园口扒开黄河大堤，滚滚黄水直冲淮北平原，夺去了数百万人的生命和财产。自此以后，由于黄河淤积，所有排水系统都被破坏，广大农民就开始过着“大雨大灾、小雨小灾、无雨旱灾”的悲惨生活。
    今天的凤阳已经大大变化了。一路上，我们看到炊烟农舍、夕阳城廓，黄金色的麦垛一堆堆的，农业社员们正在欢乐地收割秋庄稼，完全是一片丰收景象。中共凤阳县委负责同志告诉记者说：今年沿淮河地区的小麦普遍获得丰收。产量比丰收的1955年要高出10％—15％。水稻的产量也超过去年。
    解放后几年来，由于大力治理淮河，兴修农田水利，逐步完成了农业社会主义改造，现在凤阳县的农业生产有了空前迅速的发展。全县耕地面积比解放初期增加十万亩左右，1956年全县粮食总产量比解放初期增加76％。全国著名的凤阳烟叶，每年总产量达十七万担，比1952年增长了32％以上。凤阳县大部分贫农的生活，目前已经上升到中农的水平。
    农民在解放前那种颠沛流离的生活一去不复返了。解放前，灾重的年份，农民纷纷逃荒，凤阳县有时只有十多人。而今天，全县人口已增加到四十万人。红旗农业社年轻的社主任李国坤，是永远也不能忘记他幼年度过的凄惨生活，那时他跟随父母逃荒要饭，流浪到湖南省；母亲淹死了，姐姐送给人家了，弄得家破人亡，才辗转回到家乡。解放后几年，他参加了农业社，生产有了提高，生活也大大改善了。到如今，他弟弟小学毕业了，父亲健康地在社里干着农活，他自己也娶妻生了孩子，全家过着非常幸福的生活。这个社五十五岁的老社员王开云，生活上的变化也是个典型。他和他的妻子在解放前，扛大活、要饭达二十多年。在解放后几年中，他们的生活已迅速提高到接近中农的水平。过去他们抱着孩子住破庙，现在住在三间高大的新草房里，另外还有一间厨房。他不仅有棉被，还有棕床、蚊帐。过去“头戴开花帽、身穿八卦衣（补丁多）”，而今全家每人都有好几套衣服，儿子还穿上卡其布和府绸的衣服。他的儿子从小跟着他们要饭，解放后也读书读到高小毕 业，如今参加了农业生产，并且结了婚。
    我还访问了这个县的燃灯寺乡。这个乡是“凤阳花鼓”的发源地。村里妇女几乎每人都会打花鼓、唱小调。不过在解放前，她们跑出去打鼓卖唱，是以掺着泪水的欢笑，受尽侮辱与损害来取得半饱的。可是今天，花鼓小调已成为农民不可缺少的文化娱乐。我在象山农业社度过一个夜晚，当繁星满天的时候，年青的姑娘们和小伙子们就在场地上唱起来了。他们所唱的不同曲调有一百多种。不过唱的已不是“杨姑娘上吊”“小寡妇上坟”等旧调，而是“劝郎参军”、“卖余粮”、“感谢共产党”了。
