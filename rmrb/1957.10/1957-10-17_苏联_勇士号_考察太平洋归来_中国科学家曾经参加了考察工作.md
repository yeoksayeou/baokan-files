Xinhua News Agency, 16th. TASS reports: The Soviet non-magnetic research vessel "Vityaz" has returned to Golden Horn Bay near Vladivostok after conducting research in the western Pacific region for approximately three months.

The "Vityaz" traveled over 12,000 nautical miles on this voyage, studying the composition of water in the ocean, the total circulation of the hydrosphere and atmosphere in this previously little-studied area. In addition, extensive comprehensive investigations were carried out in marine geology, chemistry, and biology.

Near the Moluccas Islands, the research team dredged up some rare cephalopod mollusks that appeared as early as 400 million years ago. Near the Mariana Islands, a depression of 10,960 meters deep was discovered. This is the deepest depression in the world known to date.

According to scientists' observations, the area where the Kuroshio and Oyashio currents interact in the western Pacific has expanded significantly, and the dividing line between the two currents has shifted southward.

They also photographed the seabed at a depth of 5,780 meters and measured the temperature and moisture content of the air at an altitude of 15 to 20 kilometers above the ocean.

Chinese scientists worked alongside Soviet scientists on this research vessel.

　　苏联“勇士号”考察太平洋归来
    中国科学家曾经参加了考察工作
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联非磁性考察船“勇士号”在太平洋西部地区进行了三个月左右的考察已经回到海参崴附近的金角湾。
    “勇士号”这次航程达一万二千浬以上，它在这个过去很少研究过的地区研究了海洋中水的组成，水圈和大气的总环流。此外还进行了海洋地质、化学和生物学等的巨大综合考察工作。
    考察人员在摩鹿加群岛附近捞到一些大约早在四万万年前就已出现的一种稀有的头足类软体动物。在马里亚纳群岛附近发现了一处深达一万零九百六十公尺的凹地。这是到目前为止所知道的世界上最深的凹地。
    据科学家观察，太平洋西部的黑潮和亲潮相互作用的地区扩大很多，两股潮的分水线向南移动了。
    他们还摄制了五千七百八十公尺深处的海底相片，测量出海洋上空十五公里到二十公里的高空中空气的温度和含水量。
    在这条考察船上，有中国科学家同苏联科学家一起工作。
