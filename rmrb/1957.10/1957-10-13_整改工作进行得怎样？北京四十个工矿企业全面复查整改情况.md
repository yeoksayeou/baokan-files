　　How is the Rectification Work Proceeding?
　　A Comprehensive Review of the Rectification Situation in Forty Industrial and Mining Enterprises in Beijing

Forty state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing that are carrying out the rectification movement have recently begun a comprehensive review of the progress of the rectification work. The purpose of this review is mainly to understand the quality, effectiveness, and problems of the rectification work.

Currently, many units are continuing to inspect in batches and item by item. Some units have completed the review of resolved issues; some units will begin the review in the next few days. The method of review generally adopted by various units is to have the Party committee or departments and workshops organize personnel to inspect the resolved issues one by one or focusing on key points. Some units also organize worker representatives to observe the places where problems were solved on the spot, or convene meetings with those who raised the opinions to solicit their opinions on the handling of the problems.

Preliminary results of the review from many units indicate that most of the problems solved since the rectification movement entered the rectification stage are appropriate and thorough. For example, five enterprises in the municipal postal and telecommunications system reviewed more than 27,000 issues that had been addressed, and 93% of them were handled appropriately, with only about 7% having shortcomings or being inadequate. The China Modern Printing Company investigated the rectification work in three workshops, and 80% of the employees expressed satisfaction with the resolved issues. The results of the review also show that many contradictions in the enterprises have been reasonably resolved in a short period of time, and new atmospheres unprecedented in production management, Party-masses relations, and workers' labor attitudes have emerged.

In the process of reviewing the rectification situation, many enterprises have also discovered the following noteworthy problems: (1) Some problems were resolved relatively simply and hastily. For example, when employees in some units raised specific questions or criticisms about work or cadre style, the grassroots leaders simply replied, "We will pay attention to implementation in the future" or "Accept improvements," without specific measures on how to implement or improve. (2) Although some problems have been resolved, the resolution is not thorough or perfect enough. (3) Some problems that should have been resolved were missed. (4) Some answers to problems were misattributed or irrelevant. In addition, it was also found that some major issues of right and wrong that should have been debated were lightly explained away, while issues that should not have been debated were debated; there were also cases where some units did not consider the handling of individual problems carefully or violated national policies and regulations. After discovering these problems, various units are taking measures to resolve them.

According to the persons in charge of the Party committees of some enterprises that have conducted reviews, due to the thousands of issues raised by employees during the airing of views and free debate, the time requirement for solving problems was very urgent, and some cadres were not good at relying on the masses and lacked a responsible spirit. Therefore, it was inevitable that some simple, hasty, or omissions occurred when solving problems. Therefore, inspecting the effectiveness of the rectification while rectifying, or launching a comprehensive review by the masses after solving a large number of problems, discovering shortcomings, and correcting them immediately, is of great significance for promoting the healthy development of the rectification movement and achieving the goal of improving work vigorously. At the same time, mobilizing the masses to conduct a review can further educate the masses, make them understand that the leadership's determination to improve work is firm, and encourage the masses to participate more actively in the rectification.

### 整改工作进行得怎样？北京四十个工矿企业全面复查整改情况

　　整改工作进行得怎样？
　　北京四十个工矿企业全面复查整改情况
    据新华社12日讯　北京市四十个开展整风运动的国营厂矿企业，最近开始对整改工作的情况进行全面复查。这次复查的目的主要是了解整改工作的质量、效果和问题。
    目前，许多单位正在继续分批、逐项地检查。有些单位已将解决的问题复查完毕；有些单位最近几天内也要开始复查。各单位复查的方法一般是由党委或科室、车间组织力量，对已经解决的问题逐条地或重点地加以检查。有的单位在复查时，还组织职工代表到解决问题的地方实地观察，或召集提意见的人开会，征求他们对问题处理后的意见。
    从许多单位复查的初步结果看来，整风运动进入整改阶段以来解决的问题，大部分是恰当的、彻底的。如市邮电系统的五个企业复查了已经处理的二万七千多个问题，有93％都是处理得恰当的，只有7％左右有缺点或不够妥当。中国近代印刷公司调查了三个车间的整改工作情况，有80％的职工对已经解决的问题表示满意。复查的结果还表明，企业里的许多矛盾，由于在短时间内得到了合理解决，生产管理、党群关系和职工的劳动态度等方面，都出现了空前未有的新气象。
    在复查整改情况的过程中，许多企业也发现了下列一些值得注意的问题：（一）有些问题解决得比较简单、草率，如有些单位的职工们提出一些有关工作或干部作风等具体问题或批评意见，基层领导方面只是简单答复：“今后注意贯彻”或“接受改进”就完了，到底怎样贯彻、改进，没有具体办法。（二）有些问题虽然解决了，但解决得不够彻底或不够完善。（三）有些应该解决的问题却漏掉了。（四）有些答复的问题张冠李戴、文不对题。此外还发现有些应该辩论的大是大非的问题却轻轻解释过去了，而不应该辩论的问题却辩论了；还有某些单位对个别问题的处理考虑不周或违反国家政策规定等等。各单位发现这些问题后，正在分别采取措施，加以解决。
    据有些进行过复查的企业党委负责人说，由于职工们在大鸣大放中提出的问题成千上万，解决问题的时间要求很急迫，加上有些干部不善于依靠群众，缺乏认真负责的精神，因此在解决问题时发生一些简单、草率或遗漏的现象，是在所难免的。所以，一边整改，一边组织人力检查整改效果；或是在解决完一大批问题以后，发动群众进行全面复查，发现缺点，立即改正，这种做法对于推动整风运动的健康发展，达到狠狠地改进工作的目的，有很重要的意义。同时，发动群众进行复查也可以进一步教育群众，使群众了解领导上改进工作决心是坚决的，鼓舞群众更积极参加整风。
