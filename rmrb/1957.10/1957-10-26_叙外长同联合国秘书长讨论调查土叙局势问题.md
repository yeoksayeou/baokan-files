Xinhua News Agency, New York, 25th. Syrian Foreign Minister, Bitár, held a 70-minute meeting with UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 24th. After the meeting, Bitár said: they discussed the issue of sending an investigation delegation composed of several countries to the Middle East, but did not talk about the suggestion of Hammarskjöld going himself.

The representatives of the eleven Arab countries to the United Nations also held a meeting on the same day. They also discussed the suggestion made by Syria to form an investigation delegation composed of several countries to investigate the situation on the Syrian-Turkish border.

The United States is colluding with Western countries to support the American proposal: that Hammarskjöld go to the Middle East to conduct an investigation.

Syrian representative Zeineddine pointed out: sending Hammarskjöld to investigate is "not useful." Syria insists on an investigation team composed of several countries. Zeineddine also said that Syria will firmly oppose Western countries' attempts to delay the General Assembly debate originally scheduled for the 25th.

Sources say Western countries want to postpone the debate until after the Turkish general election on Sunday.

    叙外长同联合国秘书长讨论调查土叙局势问题
    新华社25日讯纽约消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔24日同联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德举行了七十分钟的会谈。比塔尔在会谈后说：他们讨论了派遣一个由若干国家组成的调查代表团前往中东的问题，没有谈到哈马舍尔德本人前往的建议。
    联合国的十一个阿拉伯国家代表也在同一天举行会议，他们也讨论了叙利亚提出的由几个国家组成调查代表团调查叙、土边境局势的建议。
    美国正在纠合西方国家支持美国提出的建议：由哈马舍尔德到中东去进行调查。
    叙利亚代表宰尼丁指出：派哈马舍尔德去调查“没有什么用处”，叙利亚坚持由几个国家组成调查团。宰尼丁还说，叙利亚将坚决反对西方国家企图把原定25日举行的大会辩论拖延下去。
    有消息说，西方国家想把辩论拖到土耳其星期日大选以后进行。
