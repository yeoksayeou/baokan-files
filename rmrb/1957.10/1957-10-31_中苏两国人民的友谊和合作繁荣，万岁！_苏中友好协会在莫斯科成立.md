Long Live the Friendship and Cooperation Between the Chinese and Soviet People!
The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association Established in Moscow

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 30th: The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association was formally established in Moscow. On the evening of October 29th, a grand inaugural meeting was held in the magnificent hall of the Tchaikovsky Conservatory.

The Tchaikovsky Conservatory was decorated as if for a festival. The national flags of China and the Soviet Union hung on the rostrum of the hall, along with golden characters in Chinese and Russian that read: "May the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China last forever!"

More than two thousand people attended the inaugural meeting, including representatives from state organs and social organizations, scientists, cultural workers, workers, collective farmers, students, and officers and soldiers of the Soviet army. In addition to Muscovites, there were also representatives from cities such as Leningrad, Novosibirsk, Voronezh, and Irkutsk.

The guests included Liu Xiao, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and embassy staff, Chinese experts working in Moscow enterprises, and Chinese students studying at Soviet universities.

Popova, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, presided over the meeting. The audience applauded enthusiastically when she announced the significance of the meeting and the selection of the presidium.

Andreyev, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, delivered a report on "The Establishment of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association in the Soviet Union."

Andreyev said that the Soviet Union has always been committed to developing political, economic, and cultural cooperation with all peace-loving countries. Friendship and cooperation connect the Soviet Union with many countries, especially the people's democracies. Common goals, unity of thought, and the common struggle for peace unite the Soviet Union with the people's democracies. Close and unbreakable friendship unites our people with the great Chinese people. This friendship has a long and solid tradition. Thirty thousand Chinese soldiers directly participated in the October Revolution and the battles to defend the young Soviet Republic. The Soviet and Chinese peoples fought together in the years of the Second World War, making inestimable contributions to ensuring peace in the Far East and the world.

Andreyev then spoke about the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and the development of fraternal relations between the Soviet Union and China in the past. He pointed out the achievements of socialist construction in China under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. He congratulated the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, headed by Song Qingling, a well-known Chinese stateswoman and social activist, for its fruitful activities.

Andreyev said that the fraternal friendship and close cooperation formed between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a shining example of a new type of relationship between peoples unprecedented in human history. The establishment of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association is a new complementary link in the comprehensive relationship already established between the Soviet Union and China. I believe that the initiative to establish a new social organization in the Soviet Union - the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association - fully represents the opinion of all those present and the will of all our people.

Andreyev announced that the tasks of the association are:

*   To promote the further development and consolidation of the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the peoples of the two great countries;
*   To expand cultural cooperation and comprehensively exchange experiences in cultural construction with the People's Republic of China;
*   To more widely introduce the life and socialist construction experiences of the Chinese people to all sectors of Soviet society;
*   To help the Chinese people comprehensively understand the life and labor of the Soviet people.

Andreyev concluded by saying, "Allow me, on behalf of our meeting, to extend fraternal greetings to the great Chinese people - our brothers, friends, and allies - and wish the Chinese people victory in the great cause of socialist construction. Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese people!

Andreyev's report was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

Subsequently, Kosmodemyanskaya, mother of the Soviet hero Zoya, the famous director Gerasimov, Romanovsky, Chairman of the Committee of Youth Organizations of the Soviet Union, and more than ten other representatives from various sectors, as well as representatives from Leningrad, Irkutsk, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other places, spoke at the meeting.

The attendees warmly welcomed the speech of Liu Xiao, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union. He extended his greetings to the people who organized and participated in the meeting.

He said that the establishment of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association is being held on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This has special significance. These days, the Chinese people are actively preparing with the Soviet people to jointly celebrate this great festival, launching a climax of celebrating this great festival across the country, and also a climax of strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is growing stronger day by day.

Liu Xiao pointed out that in the new situation of the development of Sino-Soviet friendly relations, the establishment of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association will make a greater contribution to the further development of the cause of Sino-Soviet friendship.

Dubrovina, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Federation, read out the draft resolution of the meeting on the establishment of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association in the Soviet Union. The meeting unanimously adopted the resolution.

The resolution stated that the representatives of all sectors of the Soviet public, workers, collective farmers, staff, scholars, writers, students, soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy, expressed the wishes of the entire Soviet people and unanimously expressed their desire to establish the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association. This demonstrates the deep friendship and respect of the Soviet people for the Chinese people.

The meeting elected a council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association composed of fifty-two prominent social activists, with Andreyev as chairman. At this moment, thunderous applause erupted throughout the venue, and Ambassador Liu Xiao warmly shook hands with Andreyev.

Marshal Chuikov read out the congratulatory telegrams to the meeting from Song Qingling, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and Qian Junrui, Secretary-General. The attendees applauded warmly to welcome them.

The attendees passed a letter of congratulations to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in a storm of applause. The letter stated that the meeting held in Moscow decided to establish the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association based on the warm desire of the two hundred million people of the Soviet Union.

    中苏两国人民的友谊和合作繁荣，万岁！
    苏中友好协会在莫斯科成立
    据新华社莫斯科30日电　苏中友好协会在莫斯科正式宣告成立。10月29日晚上，在柴可夫斯基音乐学院辉煌的大厅里举行了盛大的成立大会。
    柴可夫斯基音乐学院像节日一样装饰起来。大厅的主席台上悬着中苏两国国旗，挂着中俄文金色大字标语：“祝苏中牢不可破的友谊万世永存！”
    参加成立大会的有两千多人，其中有国家机关和社会团体的代表，科学家、文化工作者、工人、集体农民、学生、苏联军队的官兵。除了莫斯科人以外，还有列宁格勒、新西伯利亚城、沃罗?日、伊尔库次克等城市的代表。
    到会的来宾有中国驻苏联大使刘晓和大使馆人员、在莫斯科企业中工作的中国专家和在苏联高等学校中求学的中国学生。
    苏联对外文化协会理事会主席波波娃担任大会主席。当她宣布举行这次大会的意义和选出主席团的时候，全场热烈鼓掌。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员安德烈耶夫作了“关于苏联成立苏中友好协会”的报告。
    安德烈耶夫说，苏联一贯致力于同一切爱好和平的国家发展政治、经济和文化合作。友谊和合作把苏联同很多国家，首先是人民民主国家联系在一起。共同的目标、思想的一致和争取和平的共同斗争把苏联同人民民主国家团结在一起。紧密的牢不可破的友谊把我国人民同伟大的中国人民团结在一起。这种友谊具有悠久而牢固的传统。三万名中国战士拿着武器直接地参加了十月革命和保卫年青的苏维埃共和国的战斗。苏联人民和中国人民在第二次世界大战的年代里共同斗争，为确保远东和全世界的和平事业作出了不可估计的贡献。
    安德烈耶夫接着谈到了中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，谈到了过去苏联和中国之间的兄弟关系的发展。他指出了中国在光荣的共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下所取得的社会主义建设成就。他对以中国著名的国家和社会活动家宋庆龄为首的中苏友好协会的卓有成效的活动表示祝贺。
    安德烈耶夫说，苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民之间所形成的兄弟友谊和紧密合作是人类历史上空前未有的人民之间新型关系的光辉榜样。苏中友好协会的成立是苏联和中国之间已经建立起来的全面关系的一个新的补充环节。我认为，倡议在苏联成立一个新的社会团体——苏中友好协会完全可以代表全体到会者的意见和我国全体人民的意志。
    安德烈耶夫宣布这个协会的任务是：
    促进两个伟大国家的人民之间的兄弟友谊和合作的进一步发展和巩固；
    扩大文化合作，并且同中华人民共和国全面地交流文化建设的经验；
    更广泛地向苏联各界介绍中国人民的生活和社会主义建设的经验；
    帮助中国人民全面地了解苏联人民的生活和劳动。
    安德烈耶夫最后说，请允许我代表我们的大会向伟大的中国人民——我们的兄弟、朋友和同盟者致以兄弟的敬礼，祝中国人民在伟大的社会主义建设事业中取得胜利。祝苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊和合作繁荣，万岁！
    安德烈耶夫的报告不断被热烈的掌声所打断。
    接着，苏联英雄卓娅的母亲科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅、名导演格拉西莫夫、苏联青年组织委员会主席罗曼诺夫斯基以及其它各界代表，和列宁格勒、伊尔库次克、哈萨克、乌兹别克等地代表共十多人相继在会上讲了话。
    到会者热烈欢迎中国驻苏联大使刘晓的讲话。他向组织和参加大会的人们致意。
    他说，苏中友协的成立是在伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的前夕举行的。这具有了特别的意义。这些天来，中国人民正在和苏联人民一道积极准备共同欢庆这个伟大的节日，在全国范围内掀起了一个庆祝这个伟大节日的高潮，同时也是加强中苏人民友谊的高潮。中苏友谊正在日益加强。
    刘晓指出，在中苏友好关系发展的新形势下，苏中友协的成立对于进一步发展中苏友好的事业将作出更巨大的贡献。
    俄罗斯联邦教育部副部长杜伯洛维娜宣读了大会关于在苏联成立苏中友好协会的决议草案。大会一致通过了这个决议。
    决议说，苏联各界公众的代表、工人、集体农民、职员、学者、作家、学生、苏联陆军和海军的战士，表达全苏人民的心愿，一致表示成立苏中友好协会的愿望。这表现了苏联人民对中国人民深厚的情谊和尊重。
    大会选举了以安德烈耶夫为主席的、由五十二名著名社会活动家组成的苏中友好协会理事会。这时全场掌声雷动，刘晓大使和安德烈耶夫热烈握手。
    崔可夫元帅宣读了中苏友好协会总会会长宋庆龄和秘书长钱俊瑞给大会的贺电。到会者热烈鼓掌，表示欢迎。
    到会者在暴风雨般的掌声中通过了给中苏友好协会总会的贺信。信中说，在莫斯科举行的会议决定根据苏联两亿人民的热烈愿望，成立苏中友好协会。
    会后，举行了庆祝演出晚会。（附图片）
