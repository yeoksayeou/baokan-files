    Yuan Dynasty Murals of Yongle Palace

    As part of the Sanmenxia Reservoir construction, some ancient buildings will be relocated, including the Yongle Palace. To provide reference for future restoration, the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture organized more than forty art workers to Yongle Town, Yongji County, Shanxi Province this spring to replicate the Yongle Palace murals. The work lasted four months. The replicated murals and on-site painted photos were exhibited at the Palace Museum.

    Yongle Palace is said to be the hometown of Lü Dongbin, one of the "Eight Immortals" of Taoism in the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Yongle Palace was originally named Da Chunyang Wanshou Palace. The existing structures include Wuji Gate (Dragon and Tiger Hall), Sanqing Hall, Chunyang Hall, and Chongyang Hall. The halls are decorated with exquisite Yuan Dynasty murals, which are treasures of Chinese art. The murals in the Sanqing Hall cover an area of 403.34 square meters and depict more than 280 deity images. The brushwork is smooth and powerful, the shapes are varied, and the costumes are rich and colorful, making it the essence of the Yongle Palace murals. (He Gui)

    永乐宫元代壁画
    在三门峡水库工地上，一部分古代建筑物将要迁移，永乐宫也在迁移范围内。为今后修复参考，今年春文化部文物局组织了四十多位美术工作者赴山西永济县永乐镇进行了永乐宫壁画复制工作，历时四个月完成。壁画复制品和现场临绘照片曾在故宫博物院展出。
    永乐宫相传为唐（618年—907年）道教“八仙”之一吕洞宾的故里。永乐宫初名大纯阳万寿宫，现存无极门（龙虎殿）、三清殿、纯阳殿、重阳殿等四处。殿内布有精美的元代壁画，是我国艺术中的瑰宝。三清殿全室壁画达四○三·三四平方公尺，画值日神像二百八十余帧，用笔流畅有力，形像变化万千，服饰丰富多彩，可谓永乐宫壁画中的精华。　（禾圭）
