Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 16th - A communique was released in Belgrade on October 15th regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations between Yugoslavia and the German Democratic Republic.

The communique stated that, based on the letters exchanged between German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl on August 21st and Yugoslav President Tito on October 3rd of this year, the governments of Yugoslavia and the German Democratic Republic agreed during talks between government representatives of the two countries held in Belgrade on October 10th to establish diplomatic relations and exchange diplomatic representatives at the level of ministers. A statement from the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs was also released along with the communique.

The statement said: The Yugoslav government has decided to establish normal diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic. This measure is conducive to the development of international relations and helps to ease the Cold War on the German question today, thereby helping to ease tensions between East and West in general. The Yugoslav government also believes that a solution to the problem of European security should be sought in this direction, and the two parts of Germany should play an important role. The statement also said that the Yugoslav government hopes to develop friendly relations with both Germanys.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th - Western powers are generally uneasy about Yugoslavia's establishment of diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic.

The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 15th saying that it "regretted" Yugoslavia's measure. The statement said that the United States had previously indicated to Yugoslavia on several occasions its opposition to recognizing the German Democratic Republic.

Diplomats in Washington believe that Yugoslavia's recognition of East Germany is not only a blow to the West German government but also a major diplomatic defeat for the United States and its allies. This is because it is a blow to the West's attempts to isolate the East German government and a victory for the Soviet Union. Some people also worry that Yugoslavia's actions may prompt other countries to recognize East Germany.

A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office said that the British government felt "very" regretful about Yugoslavia's establishment of diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd probably also tried to prevent Yugoslavia's actions when he was recently in Belgrade.

A spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry even said that the French government had formally asked the Yugoslav government to pay attention to the so-called "regrettable consequences" that might arise from Yugoslavia's recognition of the German Democratic Republic.

West German Chancellor Adenauer and West German Foreign Minister Brentano, as well as other government officials and political figures, held talks late into the night on the 14th to discuss Yugoslavia's actions. A spokesperson for the Bonn government said that Bonn would consider Yugoslavia's recognition of East Germany an "unfriendly act" towards West Germany.

　　南斯拉夫同民主德国建交  美英法和西德竟表示不满
    新华社贝尔格莱德16日电　10月15日贝尔格莱德发表了关于南斯拉夫和德意志民主共和国之间建立外交关系的公报。
    公报说，根据德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在今年8月21日同南斯拉夫总统铁托在今年10月3日交换的信件，南斯拉夫和德意志民主共和国两国政府10月10日在贝尔格莱德举行的两国政府代表会谈中同意建立外交关系，并且交换公使级的外交代表。和公报同时发表的还有南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处的声明。
    声明说：南斯拉夫政府决定同德意志民主共和国建立正常的外交关系，这一措施有助于国际关系的发展，这样做有助于和缓今天在德国问题上的冷战，从而有助于一般地和缓东方和西方之间的紧张局势。南斯拉夫政府还相信，应该循着这种方向寻找欧洲安全问题的解决，而德国的两个部分应该起重要的作用。声明还说，南斯拉夫政府，希望同两个德国发展友好关系。
    据新华社16日讯　西方大国对南斯拉夫同德意志民主共和国建立外交关系普遍感到不安。
    美国国务院15日发表声明说，它对南斯拉夫这个措施表示“遗憾”。声明说，美国以前曾经几次向南斯拉夫表明它反对承认德意志民主共和国。
    华盛顿的外交家们认为，南斯拉夫承认民主德国不仅是对西德政府的一个打击，而且还是美国和它的盟国的一次巨大的外交挫败。因为这是对西方企图孤立民主德国政府的打击，也是苏联的胜利。一些人士还担心，南斯拉夫的行动可能促使其他一些国家承认民主德国。
    英国外交部的一个发言人说，对于南斯拉夫同德意志民主共和国建立外交关系，英国政府感到“十分”遗憾。有消息说，英国外交大臣劳埃德最近在贝尔格莱德的时候大概也曾经设法制止南斯拉夫的行动。
    法国外交部的一个发言人竟然说，法国政府已经正式要求南斯拉夫政府注意由于南斯拉夫承认德意志民主共和国而可能引起的所谓“令人遗憾的后果”。
    西德总理阿登纳和西德外交部长勃伦塔诺以及其他政府官员和政界人士14日晚上一直会谈到深夜，讨论南斯拉夫的行动。波恩政府的发言人说，波恩方面将认为，南斯拉夫对民主德国的承认是对西德的一个“不友好行动”。
