　　"Struggling to Defend the Soviet Regime"
　　The city fell, but the battle did not stop. The Odessa suburban district committee led the guerrillas to transfer to the underground quarries to continue to strike the German invaders, and finally persisted until victory, cooperating with the Red Army's offensive. This is the theme of the Soviet film "Struggling to Defend the Soviet Regime," which is being shown in major cities such as Beijing.
　　In recent years, we have not seen Soviet films depicting the heroic people of the Great Patriotic War for a long time. This film, adapted from Katayev's novel "Quarry Guerrillas," once again plunged people into that era of bloody fire. We saw how those ordinary Soviet people persisted in fighting in such harsh environments. Some people changed from weak to strong, from naive to mature. Their lives and deaths gave us a profound education; their tears and laughter also evoked our memories of past years. In the days of peaceful construction, we need such films that inspire will; today, as we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution, we need even more such films that show the heroic spirit of the Soviet people.

　　“为保卫苏维埃政权而斗争”
    城市陷落了，然而战斗没有停止。敖德萨郊区党委，领导游击队转移到采石场的地下，继续予德国侵略者以打击，终于坚持到胜利，配合了红军的进攻。这就是正在北京等大城市上演的苏联影片“为保卫苏维埃政权而斗争”的主题。
    近年来，我们好久没有看到描写卫国战争英雄人民的苏联影片了。这部根据卡达耶夫小说“采石场游击队”改编的影片，又一次把人们投入那个血火纷飞的年代。我们看到那些普通的苏维埃人，怎样在那样艰苦的环境里坚持战斗。有人从懦弱变成坚强，从幼稚变为成熟。他们的生和死，给了我们深刻的教育；他们的啼和笑，也唤起我们对过去年代的记忆。在和平建设的日子，我们需要这类激励意志的影片；在纪念伟大的十月革命四十周年的今天，我们更需要这类表现苏维埃人英雄气概的影片。（怀湘）
