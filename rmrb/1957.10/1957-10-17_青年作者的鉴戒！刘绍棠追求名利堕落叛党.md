Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: The Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Youth League of China, the Youth Writers Work Committee of the Chinese Writers Association, and the China Youth Daily recently held successive rallies to criticize the rightist Liu Shaotang's anti-Party words and deeds. More than 1,000 young writers and young literature enthusiasts from Beijing attended the meetings. More than 20 people spoke at the meetings. Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Lao She, Vice Chairman, Yang Haibo, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the Youth League, Guo Xiaochuan, Deputy Secretary of the Party Group of the Writers Association, and writer Yan Wenjing spoke at the meetings. Speakers unanimously agreed that the process of the 22-year-old young author Liu Shaotang's degeneration and betrayal of the Party is deeply worthy of being taken as a warning by the vast number of young literary authors and young people.

Liu Shaotang, who touted himself as a "prodigy" and "talented scholar," was just a first-year junior high school student wearing a red scarf in the year of liberation at the age of thirteen. After liberation, some of his novels reflecting rural life began to be noticed by the literary world. Over the past few years, with the vigorous cultivation of the Party, he entered Peking University and became a young author capable of publishing several special collections. However, Liu Shaotang gradually betrayed his promise to the Party to "go deep into life and transform himself," and embarked on the road of pursuing personal fame and fortune and opposing the Party and socialism. Since the second half of last year until this spring, under the influence of the international anti-communist wave and domestic rightists, Liu Shaotang's anti-Party ideology in politics and literature has been clearly exposed. In many articles and talks, he attacked the literary line put forward in Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," opposed literature serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving politics, opposed the popularization of literature and art, and opposed socialist realism. In the final analysis, he opposed the Party's leadership over literary creation, attempting to sell his "works" that distort reality and promote decadent bourgeois ideas under the guise of so-called "writing truthfully" and striving for "freedom of creation." Liu Shaotang also negated the tremendous achievements made by Chinese new literature and Soviet literature in the past one or two decades, attempting to obliterate the extremely profound influence of the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" on Chinese new literature, saying that "no noteworthy works and writers have appeared in China in the past fifteen years." At the same time, he believed that he was "quite mature" in all aspects. He smeared many well-known old writers, called himself the "Hebei School," and was arrogant and conceited.

Many people, in their speeches, exposed and criticized Liu Shaotang's nonsense plagiarized from bourgeois ideology. Liu Shaotang once distorted the content of the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" into so-called "programmatic" and "tactical" parts. On the one hand, he expressed "recognition" that literature serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and writers going deep into life, etc., were programmatic; but at the same time, he believed that advocating the popularization of literature at that time was "tactical," and that promoting popularization and literary reflection of politics was now "outdated." Regarding this point, Yan Wenjing and others pointed out in their speeches that Liu Shaotang's trick was to use the mask of his "support" for the "programmatic" part to achieve his goal of completely negating the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and abolishing the Party's literary policy. Everyone pointed out that during the high tide of national agricultural cooperativization in the winter of 1956, Liu Shaotang's novels with rural life as the theme did not reflect the vigorous mass struggle at all, but instead were full of toxins that uglified socialist society, and he successively published articles attacking the Party's literary policy. These are enough to show that Liu Shaotang fundamentally opposes literature serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and resists the Party's leadership over literary and art undertakings; his so-called "freedom of creation" is the "freedom" to slander the new society and spread rumors. Lao She pointed out that the people of the whole country are building socialism, and writers who eat the people's rice and flour and tempt the people to take the capitalist road, are they writers or traitors? If the people give writers this kind of "freedom" to bite the hand that feeds them, the people will lose their freedom. Lao She said that socialism is fresh, lively, and rich and colorful. The fact that writers write less and not profoundly enough is due to insufficient immersion in life, and is by no means the result of the current ideological unity of writers. Everyone believed in their speeches that only by accepting the leadership of the Communist Party, going deep into life, going deep among the masses, and studying Marxism-Leninism can writers transform themselves, improve their ability to understand things, and deeply reflect our era. Writers must first break the shackles of individualism and the pursuit of fame and fortune in order to obtain true freedom.

Everyone also revealed that in recent years, Liu Shaotang has been extremely hostile to the Party's leadership and hostile to the collective, scolding the Party as a "selfish" "clique." Like other rightists in society, he also opposed the Party's leadership over universities and opposed the Party's political and ideological education. He also slandered socialist society as the "root" of bureaucratism and attacked the policy of agricultural cooperativization. Liu Shaotang not only began to engage in small group activities with several young rightists in literary circles in Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhejiang, but he also proposed a rural "transformation" plan, preparing to establish an experimental zone in the countryside to resist the Party's cooperativization movement.

Why has Liu Shaotang, a young man who has been growing up in the new society and has been educated by the Party, degenerated to this point? This was a question that everyone paid attention to discussing at this meeting. The speakers unanimously pointed out that the answer must first be found from Liu Shaotang's ideological roots and class roots. Liu Shaotang was born into a family of declining landlords and merchants. His grandfather was a powerful puppet township head. Liu Shaotang's thinking was imprinted with the idea of "bringing honor to his ancestors" from an early age. Liu Shaotang himself also admitted that his "belief in pursuing fame and fortune is very firm, and the idea of striving for personal gain has taken root since he understood things." From the time he started writing his first novel, he wanted to "kill two birds with one stone" and "gain both fame and fortune." Because of this, Liu Shaotang regarded joining the Party as "capital" to enhance his personal worth. After joining the Party, he not only did not accept the Party's criticism and education, but instead continued to develop his personal ambitions, becoming more and more distant from the Party and the people. Now Liu Shaotang has bought a house in Beijing. Although his savings have reached more than 10,000 yuan, he still shouts "strive for 30,000 yuan in savings." Liu Shaotang often does not participate in Party life. He has a lot of money, but only pays a dime of Party dues each month. Although he had lived in the countryside for a short period of time, he never contacted farmers in the countryside, did not participate in labor, and stayed in his "small house" all day long. Even the white steamed buns he ate were steamed in Beijing and brought with him. This "young writer" who lives a life of luxury every day, however, lets his mother who lives with him eat corn bread. Liu Shaotang's soul is filled with the stench of copper, and he has long forgotten the expectations of the Party and the people for him.

Everyone pointed out in their speeches that a lot of experience and lessons can also be found from the cultivation and education of Liu Shaotang and young literary authors. In the past, ideological and political education for young authors was insufficient, their encouragement was inappropriate, and strict requirements were lacking. Some young authors were transferred from their original jobs and separated from life as soon as they wrote some works. Facts have proved that young authors who lack both life experience and creative experience should not leave their actual work and become "professional writers." The praise of young authors by some newspapers and publishing departments has also greatly fueled the development of their ideas of fame and fortune. For example, some of Liu Shaotang's substandard works were published, and the publishing house prepaid royalties before his works were even written. Everyone believes that these practices for young authors must be seriously corrected in the future.

In their speeches, everyone used "not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth" to describe Liu Shaotang's arrogance and ignorance. Mao Dun pointed out that Liu Shaotang's fallacies of slandering the socialist system and socialist literature and art were actually picking up the dregs of rightists and international revisionists who were older than him. Mao Dun said that Liu Shaotang opposes socialist realism, but I doubt how many Chinese and foreign realist works he has read and what research he has done on the literary theory of realism. It is fundamentally wrong to think that realism is "writing truthfully." It is a bourgeois saying to talk about "writing truthfully" without talking about position, and it has a history of more than a hundred years. The question is what is truth, and this depends on what position and what angle to write the truth. Lao She, Yan Wenjing, and others all criticized Liu Shaotang's fallacy that Chinese new literature is "not as good as before." They hoped that Liu Shaotang could ask writers who are older than him about their situation in the old era. They said that with Liu Shaotang's ability and cultivation, it would be difficult to become a writer in the old society. In the old society, I don't know how many young people with more talent than Liu Shaotang were buried.

Mao Dun, Lao She, Guo Xiaochuan, Yang Haibo, and others all talked about in their speeches that a lot of young authors have emerged in recent years, which is a good phenomenon. The ranks of writers need to be constantly injected with new blood. However, young authors must accept the leadership of the Communist Party, go deep into the mass struggle, and establish the idea of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Young authors should participate in practical work at the grassroots level, transform themselves in labor and in the mass struggle, and use their spare time or take creative vacations when necessary to create. Lao She said that young authors don't have to think about whether they will become Shakespeare, what is important is to work. As long as they love labor, love socialism, love the people, and are willing to live and fight with the people, they will surely write excellent works.

　　青年作者的鉴戒！
　　刘绍棠追求名利堕落叛党
    据新华社16日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央宣传部、中国作家协会青年作家工作委员会和中国青年报最近连续召开批判右派分子刘绍棠反党言行的大会。参加大会的有北京青年文学作者、青年文学爱好者一千余人。在大会上发言的有二十多人。中国作家协会主席茅盾、副主席老舍，团中央宣传部长杨海波、作家协会党组副书记郭小川和作家严文井等在会上讲了话。发言者一致认为，二十二岁的青年作者刘绍棠堕落、叛党的经过，深深值得广大青年文学作者和青年们引为戒鉴。
    自诩为“神童”、“才子”的刘绍棠，解放那年只不过是带着红领巾的十三岁的初中一年级学生。解放后他写的一些反映农村生活的小说开始为文艺界所注意。几年来，在党的大力培养下，他进了北京大学，并且成为能够出版几本专集的青年作者。但是刘绍棠却渐渐背叛了他向党提出的“深入生活，改造自己”的诺言，走上了追求个人名利，反党反社会主义的道路。从去年下半年以来直到今年春季，在国际上反共浪潮和国内右派分子的影响下，刘绍棠在政治上和文艺上的反党思想明显地暴露出来了。他在许多文章和谈话中攻击毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中提出的文艺路线，反对文艺为工农兵、为政治服务，反对文艺的普及工作，反对社会主义现实主义。归根结底，他反对党对文艺创作的领导，企图在所谓“写真实”、争取“创作自由”的幌子下，贩卖他歪曲现实、宣传腐朽的资产阶级思想的“作品”。刘绍棠还否定中国新文学和苏联文学在近一二十年中取得的巨大成就，企图抹煞“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”对中国新文艺所起的极其深广的影响，说什么“近十五年来中国没有出现值得注意的作品和作家”。与此同时，他却认为自己各方面都已“相当成熟”，他污蔑许多知名的老作家，并以“河北派”自居，狂妄自大，不可一世。
    许多人在发言中，揭露和批判了刘绍棠从资产阶级思想中剽窃来的胡言乱语。刘绍棠曾经把“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的内容歪曲成所谓“纲领性”和“策略性”两部分，他一方面表示“承认”文艺为工农兵服务、作家必须深入生活等是纲领性的；但同时却认为当时提倡文学的普及工作是“策略性”的，现在再提普及和文艺反映政治就已经“过时”了。关于这一点，严文井等在发言中指出，刘绍棠的花招是想利用他“拥护”“纲领性”部分的假面具，来达到他全盘否定“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，取消党的文艺方针的目的。大家指出，在1956年冬季全国农业合作化高潮到来的时候，刘绍棠以农村生活为主题的小说对于轰轰烈烈的群众斗争没有丝毫反映，相反却充满了丑化社会主义社会的毒素，他又接二连三地发表了向党的文艺方针进攻的文章。这些足以说明，刘绍棠从根本上反对文艺为工农兵服务，抗拒党对文艺事业的领导；他所谓的“创作自由”就是污蔑新社会和造谣诽谤的“自由”。老舍指出，全国人民正在建设社会主义，作家吃着人民的米面而诱惑人民走资本主义道路，他们是作家呢还是汉奸呢？假如人民给作家这种吃里爬外的“自由”，人民就会失去自由。老舍说，社会主义是新鲜，活泼、丰富多采的。作家写的少、写的不深刻，是由于深入生活不够，而绝不是现在作家思想一致的结果。大家在发言中都认为，作家只有接受共产党的领导，深入生活，深入群众，学习马克思列宁主义，才能使自己获得改造，提高认识事物的能力，才有可能深刻地反映我们的时代。作家必须首先打破个人主义和名利思想的束缚才能获得真正的自由。
    大家还揭露，近年以来，刘绍棠极端仇视党的领导和仇视集体，骂党是“自私自利”的“集团”。同社会上其他右派分子一样，他也反对党对高等学校的领导，反对党的政治思想教育，他并且诽谤社会主义社会是产生官僚主义的“根源”，攻击农业合作化政策。刘绍棠不仅开始同北京、天津、浙江文艺界的几个青年右派分子搞小集团活动，他还拟议了一个农村“改造”计划，准备在乡村搞一个实验区，同党的合作化运动相抗衡。
    刘绍棠这个一直在新社会成长起来的青年，曾经受过党的教育，为什么会堕落到这个地步，是这次会上大家注意讨论的问题。发言的人们一致指出，这首先要从刘绍棠的思想根源、阶级根源去找答案。刘绍棠出身于没落地主兼商人的家庭，他的祖父是有权有势的伪乡长，刘绍棠的思想从小就被刻上了“光宗耀祖”的烙印。刘绍棠自己也承认他的“追求名利的信念是非常坚定的，为个人奋斗的思想从一懂事就扎下了根”，从他开始写作第一篇小说起，他就想“一箭双雕”，“名利双收”。正因为如此，刘绍棠才把入党看成提高个人身价的“资本”。入党以后，他不仅不接受党的批评教育，反而不断发展个人野心，同党同人民越离越远。现在刘绍棠在北京买了房子。他的存款虽然已达一万多元，但仍喊“为三万元存款而奋斗”。刘绍棠经常不参加党的生活。他有了许多钱，但每月却只交一毛钱党费。他虽然也曾到乡村住过短时期，但在农村中从来不同农民接触，不参加劳动，整天呆在自己的“小屋子里”，连吃的白面馒头，也是从北京蒸好带去的。也就是这个自己终日过着优厚的物质生活的“青年作家”，却让同他在一起生活的母亲吃窝头。刘绍棠的灵魂深处，已经充满着腐朽的铜臭，他早已忘掉党和人民对他的期望。
    大家在发言中指出，从对刘绍棠以及青年文学作者的培养教育工作上，也可以找出不少经验教训。过去对于青年作者思想政治教育不够，对他们的鼓励不适当，而缺少严格的要求。有些青年作者刚刚写出些作品，就被调离原来工作岗位，脱离了生活。事实证明，这样既缺少生活经验，又缺少创作经验的青年作者是根本不应该脱离实际工作，当什么“专业作家”的。有些报刊、出版部门对青年作者的吹捧，也大大助长了他们的名利思想的发展。例如，刘绍棠的一些不够水平的作品被拿来发表了，他的作品还没有写出，出版社就预支了稿费。大家认为，对于青年作者的这些做法，今后必须认真纠正。
    大家在发言中，以“不知天高地厚”来形容刘绍棠的狂妄和无知。茅盾指出，刘绍棠诬蔑社会主义制度和社会主义文艺的谬论，实际上是拾了比他年纪大的右派分子和国际修正主义者的牙慧。茅盾说，刘绍棠反对社会主义现实主义，但我怀疑他读过多少中、外现实主义的作品，对现实主义的文艺理论有过什么研究。以为现实主义就是“写真实”是根本错误的。不谈立场而谈“写真实”是资产阶级的说法，早有一百多年历史了。问题在于什么是真实，这就要看从什么立场、什么角度去写真实。老舍、严文井等都批驳了刘绍棠认为中国新文艺“今不如昔”的谬论。他们希望刘绍棠能向年纪比他大些的作家了解一下他们在旧时代的处境，他们说，以刘绍棠这一点能力和修养，在旧社会是很难成为什么作家的，在旧社会里，不知有多少比刘绍棠更有才华的青年被埋没。
    茅盾、老舍、郭小川、杨海波等在发言中都谈到，这些年来，出现了很多青年作者，这是一个好现象。作家的队伍中，需要不断地注入新的血液。但是，青年作者必须接受共产党的领导，深入群众斗争，树立为工农兵服务的思想。青年作者应当参加基层实际工作，在劳动中、在群众斗争中改造自己，利用业余时间或在必要时采取创作假期的办法进行创作。老舍说，青年作者们首先不必先想会不会成为莎士比亚，要紧的是去工作。只要热爱劳动，热爱社会主义，热爱人民，肯同人民在一起生活，一起奋斗，就一定会写出优秀作品。
