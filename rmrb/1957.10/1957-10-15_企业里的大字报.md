　　Bureaucracy in the Competition Office
    The cadres in the Competition Office have a serious bureaucratic work style. They only sit in the office listening to reports, their work is not thorough, they usually sit in the office with nothing to do, reading newspapers and chatting. They are only busy at the end of the quarter listening to reports and requests from various units, setting competition guarantee conditions and awarding prizes at the end of the quarter. Therefore, when awarding prizes, the office cannot even propose a preliminary list of award-winning units. They do not specifically assist relevant units in researching and handling rationalization proposals, but simply copy and forward them. The person in charge of rationalization proposals sits in the office all day learning Russian and reading newspapers, becoming a cadre learning Russian. Competition has become a formality, advanced workers cannot see the advanced aspects, and propaganda and mobilization work is also at a standstill. This bureaucratic work style must be corrected immediately.

    "Returning the Jade Intact to Zhao"
    During last year's wage reform, we had opinions on the wage zone division in the wage reform plan for teachers in the railway system. At that time, Zhang Yuanshi, the head of the General Education Section, and Wei Honglu, the inspector, jointly wrote a letter to the Ministry of Education on July 28. The Ministry of Education forwarded it to the Ministry of Railways on August 10, and the Labor and Wage Bureau of the Ministry of Railways forwarded the original letter to the Director's Office of the Beijing Railway Administration on October 10. On October 25, it was approved to the Labor and Wage Department of the Bureau for handling. The director of the Labor and Wage Department wrote on October 20: "The wage section should contact the education department." A few days later, Cui Yongchun, the head of the wage section, handed the original letter to the original proposer, saying: "The material you submitted with your opinion has been returned to you, have you seen it?" This solemn letter of opinion, after entering and leaving three buildings, lasting more than two months, was returned to the original proposer themselves "for handling" without any changes.
    As the head of the wage section responsible for the overall wage issues, Mr. Cui, please consider the following two questions:
    1. What kind of attitude should be adopted towards letters from the people?
    2. Since wage issues should be handled and answered by the wage section, why was it returned to the original proposer?

    A Word to the Directors
    The directors are indeed very busy with their daily work, but "caring for the masses, approaching the masses, and understanding the masses" should also be an important matter for leading comrades. In the past, the directors have not done enough in this regard; many employees have not even met the directors. Therefore, we put forward the following suggestions:
    1. The directors should give some reports on current affairs policies and socialist education to everyone at a certain time, so as to help everyone more politically.
    2. The directors should take some time each month to personally receive visiting employees and listen to the masses' opinions on work and life.
    3. The directors can focus on participating in some employee amateur activities, which can not only strengthen the connection with the employees, but also encourage everyone to participate in amateur activities.
    4. The directors can take some time to visit the single and family dormitories of employees, which can not only understand the living conditions of the employees' families, but also promote the employees' work enthusiasm.
    5. The directors should sometimes eat in the large canteen, or often come to the large canteen to take a look. This way, they can understand the lives of the employees and contact the broad masses of employees, which is good for enhancing unity and improving the work of the canteen.

    竞赛办公室的官僚主义
    竞赛办公室的干部有严重的官僚主
  义工作作风，只坐办公室听汇报，工作不深入，平常没有事坐在办公室内，看报聊天，只是到季末听各单位的汇报与要求，订竞赛保证条件和季末评奖时忙一阵。因此评奖时，办公室也提不出受奖单位的初步名单。不具体协助有关单位研究和处理合理化建议，而是照抄照转，管合理化建议的人，成天无事坐在办公室学俄文看报，成了学俄文干部。竞赛成了形式，先进工作者也看不到先进之处，宣传鼓动工作也处于停顿状态。这种官僚主义的工作作风，必须立即改正。

    “完璧归赵”
    去年工资改革的时候，我们对铁路系统教师工资改革方案中的工资区划分问题有意见，当时曾由普教科长张元士和视导员魏洪禄具名于7月28日写了一封信给教育部，教育部于8月10日转给铁道部，铁道部劳动工资局于10月10日将原信转给北京铁路管理局局长室，10月25日批给局劳动工资处处理，劳动工资处处长于10月20日批曰：“工资科与教育处联系一下”。过了几天，工资科崔永春科长就将原信交给了原提意见人，说：“你们提的意见那份材料给你们送回去了，你看见了吗？”这份郑重其事的意见书，出进了三座大楼，历时两个多月，原封不动的又退回原提意见人自己“处理”了。
    作为负责全局工资问题的崔科长请考虑以下两个问题：
    一、到底以一种什么态度对待人民来信。
    二、工资问题本是工资科应该处理答复的，为什么要退给原提意见人？

    向局长们进一言
    局长同志们的日常工作的确很忙，可是“关心群众，接近群众，了解群众”也应当是领导同志们的一项重要事情，过去在这方面局长同志们是作的很不够的；有不少职工连局长们的面还没见过，因此我们提出以下几点意见：
    一、局长们能在一定的时间给大家作一些有关时事政策及社会主义教育的报告，从政治上多帮助大家。
    二、局长们每月应抽出一定时间，亲自接待来访的职工，倾听群众对工作和生活的意见。
    三、局长们可重点参加一些职工业余活动，既可密切和职工群众的联系，并能带动大家参加业余活动。
    四、局长可抽出一定时间到各职工单身、家属宿舍去访问，既可了解职工家属的生活情况，并促进职工们的工作热情。
    五、局长们应该有时到大食堂进餐，或者经常到大食堂来看看，这样，既了解职工群众们的生活，并接触了广大职工，对增强团结改进食堂工作是有好处的。
