    Prostitution Popular in Paris
    Prostitution is increasing in Paris. The Paris Police Commissioner recently had to announce that prostitutes are everywhere in Paris; places where prostitutes never appeared before now have them. Even the police are helpless.
    He told a reporter from "Le Monde" that complaints about this phenomenon have been pouring in recently, but he can't do anything about it. The law passed by the French authorities in 1946 to close brothels has become ineffective in the face of reality. Therefore, it must be amended immediately to end their helplessness.
    The police chief made a cosmetic request: give him the power to ban prostitutes from entering certain areas.

    巴黎娼妓流行
    巴黎娼妓日益增加。巴黎警察总监最近不得不宣布，整个巴黎到处都是妓女，从前没有出现过妓女的地方，现在也出现了妓女。连警察也束手无策。
    他对“世界报”记者说，最近对这种现象的抗议纷至沓来，可是他也没有什么办法。1946年法国当局封闭妓院的法律，在事实面前已经不起作用。因此，必须立刻加以修改，以终止他们无能为力的现状。
    这位警察头子提出了装点门面的要求：给他权力以禁止妓女进入某些地区。
