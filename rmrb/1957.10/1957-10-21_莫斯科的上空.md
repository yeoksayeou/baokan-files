Ode to October

    Above Moscow
    Bing Xin
  Carrying the hazy weariness of travel,
  I returned from the West; in the rumbling of the aircraft wings—the world's mother's anxiety and hope
  Surged in my breast. Mothers of Hiroshima,
  Mothers of Warsaw, mothers of the Gold Coast, mothers of Cyprus… millions of arms waving, calling out their pain and protest: We don't want hydrogen bombs, atomic bombs, we don't want the disasters that destroy the world! We want peace, a happy life, we want to protect millions of babies! The West is filled with rolling dark clouds, the clamor of war drowns out the voice of justice—the midnight sky is a sheet of black, not a single ray of light can be seen! In an instant—we flew over Moscow! Looking down, I saw light everywhere, this light filled my eyes, sparkling like countless stars! This is the first great city that never sleeps, this is the first fortress defending peace! In an instant, my heart was filled with faith and comfort, and the clouds of sorrow were dispelled by these myriad points of light! Now, two years later, the first star of peace
  Has once again been launched into space from there, the mother holding her sleeping baby smiles
  Looking up at its path in the clouds! It circles the earth urgently, flying over every city on earth. It carries the power and will of the Soviet people, spreading the message of peace to the people of the world! Let the war demons in the black clouds tremble! Let the nuclear weapons created for destruction
  Fall from their softening hands! This star of peace has given a firm guarantee! Mothers have realized their wishes, who dares to start a war again?!

### 莫斯科的上空
冰心

专栏：十月颂歌

    莫斯科的上空
    冰心带着朦胧的旅倦，
  我从西方归来；隆隆的机翼声里——世界母亲的焦虑和希望
  鼓荡在我的胸怀。广岛的母亲，
  华沙的母亲，黄金海岸的母亲，塞浦路斯的母亲……千万只手臂挥舞着，叫出了她们的痛苦和抗议：我们不要氢弹，原子弹，我们不要毁灭世界的祸灾！我们要和平，幸福的生活，我们要保卫千千万万的婴孩！西方是滚滚的乌云充塞，战争的嚷叫淹没了正义的声音——半夜的天空是一片沉黑，看不见一丝一线的光明！霎时间——我们飞临莫斯科的上空！低头看见了遍地的光明，这光明布满了我的眼界，点点滴滴繁星似地晶莹！这是第一座伟大的不夜城市，这是第一座保卫和平的堡垒！霎时间，我心里充满了信念和慰安，朵朵的愁云被这万点光明冲散！如今，在两年后的今天，第一颗和平的星辰
  又从那里射向天空，怀抱着睡婴的母亲微笑着
  仰望它的云中的道路！它围绕大地急急地飞行，飞临大地的每一个城市。它带着苏联人民的力量和意志，把和平的消息传播给世界的人民！让黑云里的战魔们发抖罢！让为毁灭而创造的核子武
  器从他们发软的手中落下！这颗和平的星星，给了坚强的保证！母亲们实现了她们的愿望，看有谁再敢挑起战争？！
