Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 28th – Xiangbi Township, Yibin County, Sichuan Province, has established a permanent water conservancy engineering team. They contract water conservancy projects to local agricultural cooperatives, enabling year-round farmland water conservancy construction throughout the township.

This engineering team is composed of more than thirty members drawn from all twenty-nine agricultural cooperatives in the township. They are specifically responsible for the construction and maintenance of water conservancy projects throughout the township. After the agricultural cooperatives formulate plans and implementation schemes for water conservancy projects, they contract the projects to the engineering team to complete. This resolves the contradiction between water conservancy construction and agricultural production caused by insufficient labor in the agricultural cooperatives. For example, the Xinhua First Branch started construction on a mountain reservoir at the beginning of last year. Due to insufficient labor, it had not been completed after a year. If relying solely on the labor of the branch itself, it would still be impossible to complete in the first half of this year, and there was a risk of being washed away by floods. This spring, the engineering team contracted the project and quickly completed it, ensuring that the cooperative could promptly increase double-cropping rice by more than 100 mu this year, with a 30% increase in yield per mu.

    二十九个社联合起来　一年四季都能施工
    象鼻乡成立常年水利工程队
    新华社成都28日电　四川省宜宾县象鼻乡建立常年水利工程队，向当地农业社承包水利工程，使全乡一年四季都能进行农田水利建设。
    这支工程队是由全乡二十九个农业社抽调三十多个社员组成的，专门负责全乡水利工程的兴修和养护工作。各农业社在制订兴修水利工程计划和实施方案以后，就把工程包给工程队去完成，这便解决了农业社因为劳力不足而造成的兴修水利与农业生产之间的矛盾。例如新华一分社从去年年初动工修建的一口山弯塘，由于劳力不足，拖了一年还没有修成，如果单靠本社的人力，今年上半年仍无法完成，并且有被洪水冲垮的危险。今年春天工程队承包了这项工程，就很快地修好了，保证了这个社今年及时增种双季稻一百多亩，每亩增产30％。
