　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Taipei: More than a thousand workers at the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation's shipyard in Taiwan walked off the job yesterday and declared a strike. The strike was triggered by the American side's sudden suspension of wages due to workers on October 6th.

　　This shipyard is located in Keelung, Taipei. The strike has brought production at the factory to a standstill.

　　This shipbuilding company was originally named Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation and was the public property of the Chinese people in Taiwan. At the beginning of this year, it was "leased" by the Chiang Kai-shek clique to the American Ingalls Shipbuilding Company.

　　抗议美国资本家停发工资
    台湾千余造船工人罢工
    新华社13日讯　台北消息：台湾英加尔斯造船船坞公司造船厂的一千多名工人，昨天离开工厂，宣布罢工。罢工是因为美方10月6日突然停发应该发给工人的工资而引起的。
    这个造船厂在台北基隆。罢工已经使这个厂的生产陷于停顿。
    这家造船公司原名台湾造船公司，是我国人民在台湾的公有财产，今年年初被蒋介石集团“出租”给美国英加尔斯造船公司。
