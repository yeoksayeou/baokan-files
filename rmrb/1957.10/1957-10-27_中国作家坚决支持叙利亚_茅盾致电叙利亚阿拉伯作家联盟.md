Xinhua News Agency, 26th. Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, sent a telegram to the Syrian Arab Writers Union, expressing support for the Writers Union's condemnation of the American aggression conspiracy.

The telegram said: American imperialism is saber-rattling, instigating Turkey to invade Syria, and peace in the Middle East and the world is being severely threatened. We express boundless indignation at this malicious conspiracy of the imperialists. All peace-loving people in the world are very clear that the American imperialists are launching an invasion of Syria only because the Syrian people, for the sake of their national independence and freedom, are unwilling to obey the evil conspiracy of American imperialism to divide the unity of the Arab people and provoke war in the Middle East, and only because the Syrian people are unwilling to be subjected to the colonialist enslavement of American imperialism. Precisely because of this, the heroic struggle currently waged by the Syrian people to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland is by no means isolated. The Chinese people stand with you and resolutely give you brotherly support. We firmly believe that if the imperialists dare to play with fire, they will burn themselves. Dear friends, please convey to the heroic Syrian people the lofty respect of us, the Chinese literary workers. Chinese writers warmly support the legitimate appeal of Syrian writers and hereby express firm support.

    中国作家坚决支持叙利亚
    茅盾致电叙利亚阿拉伯作家联盟
    新华社26日讯　中国作家协会主席茅盾打电报给叙利亚阿拉伯作家联盟，表示支持作家联盟对美国侵略阴谋的谴责。
    电文说：美帝国主义正在剑拔弩张，策动土耳其侵略叙利亚，中东和世界和平正在遭到严重威胁。我们对帝国主义者这种恶毒的阴谋，表示无比愤慨。全世界一切爱好和平的人都十分清楚，美帝国主义者发动对叙利亚的侵略，只是因为叙利亚人民为了自己民族的独立和自由，不愿顺从美帝国主义所进行的分裂阿拉伯人民的团结在中东挑起战争的罪恶阴谋，只是因为叙利亚人民不愿再受美帝国主义的殖民主义的奴役。正因为这样，叙利亚人民，目前为保卫祖国自由独立而进行的英勇斗争，绝不是孤立的。中国人民是和你们站在一起，坚决地给你们兄弟般的支持的。我们深信，帝国主义者如果胆敢玩火，必将自焚。亲爱的朋友们，请转致我们，中国的文学工作者们，对于英勇的叙利亚人民的崇高的敬意。中国作家热烈地拥护叙利亚作家的正当呼吁，特此表示坚决的支持。
