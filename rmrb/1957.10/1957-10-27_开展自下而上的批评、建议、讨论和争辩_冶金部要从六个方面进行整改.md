Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has comprehensively entered the third stage of the rectification campaign. The Ministry has decided to launch a mass rectification movement by conducting extensive bottom-up criticism, suggestions, discussions, and debates, starting with general airing of views and gradually deepening into thematic airing and thematic debates, to thoroughly overcome bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism in leadership.

On the 22nd and 23rd, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held mobilization meetings for all Party members and all staff members, respectively, announcing the general plan for the third stage of the rectification campaign and expressing the leadership's determination to thoroughly rectify. Vice Minister Lü Dong delivered a report on behalf of the Ministry's Rectification Leadership Group at the all-staff meeting on the 23rd. He pointed out that the focus should be on examining and overcoming bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism in leadership work in the following six aspects: First, examine what shortcomings and problems exist in the implementation of the Central Committee's guidelines and policies, such as how the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift has been implemented, how the construction policy of combining large-scale enterprises with medium- and small-scale enterprises has been implemented, what problems exist in various aspects such as cadre policy, labor and wage policy, and technology policy, and what problems exist in the transformation of old factories, the development of raw material industries, the cultivation of construction forces, and design ideas, etc. Second, what problems currently exist in the leadership style of the Ministry and Bureaus and in the relationship between the Party and the masses, where does bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism exist, and how should they be improved. Third, what problems exist in the industrial system, as well as problems in capital construction, production, finance, cadres, planning, etc., which must be examined and resolved by everyone. Fourth, what problems exist in the enterprise management and business construction of various departments, which rules and regulations are divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, and how should they be thoroughly reformed. Fifth, to what extent should the organization be streamlined, and how should cadres be transferred to lower levels. Sixth, regarding the living and welfare issues of employees.

Regarding the methods of rectification, the Ministry requires the use of the "big blooming, big contending" method, launching a mass bottom-up criticism movement throughout the entire organization, launching a mass-scale rationalization proposal movement, and launching a mass movement of big debates, to burn down the "three isms" through this movement. Lü Dong pointed out in his report that the forms of "big blooming, big contending" can be diverse, such as holding various types of forums, individual talks, heart-to-heart talks, etc., and especially advocated using big-character posters to launch "big blooming, big contending, big debate" and to create a climax of airing views for rectification with big-character posters. For some important issues, such as guidelines and policies, systems, and streamlined organizations, thematic airing of views and thematic debates should also be conducted. This is to implement the mass line in rectification, and all important issues should be resolved through mass "big blooming, big contending, big debate."

Lü Dong also announced in his report some basic measures decided upon in overcoming bureaucratic work style, and called on all staff to launch discussions in "big blooming, big contending." For example, transferring some enterprises to local management, expanding the management power of enterprises under the principle of ensuring unified planning and key construction; thoroughly streamlining forms; canceling and merging some overlapping institutions, and transferring a group of cadres to lower levels.

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has implemented the spirit of "rectification while correcting" in the anti-Rightist struggle and has made many improvements to its work. The relationship between the Party and the masses is closer than before, various units have begun to streamline their organizations by accepting reasonable opinions from the masses, 20% of the department and bureau-level cadres have been transferred from the Ministry and Bureau organs, and 500 cadres have been transferred to lower levels to participate in production and manage production. These improvements have encouraged the masses' confidence in rectification.

    开展自下而上的批评、建议、讨论和争辩
    冶金部要从六个方面进行整改
    新华社24日讯　冶金工业部已开始全面转入整风第三阶段。这个部决定通过自下而上的广泛的批评、建议、讨论和争辩，并且首先从一般鸣放开始，然后逐步深入展开专题鸣放、专题争辩，掀起群众性的整改运动，以彻底克服领导上的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义。
    22日和23日，冶金工业部分别举行了全部的党内动员大会和全部工作人员动员大会，宣布整风第三阶段的大体规划，并且表示了领导上彻底整改的决心。副部长吕东代表部的整风领导小组在23日全部工作人员大会上作了报告。他指出，要着重从以下六个方面来检查和克服领导工作上的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义：第一，检查执行中央方针政策上有什么缺点和毛病，如勤俭建国方针贯彻得如何，大型企业和中、小型企业相结合的建设方针执行得如何，干部政策、劳动工资政策、技术政策等各方面有什么毛病，在旧厂改造上、发展原料工业上、培养建筑力量上、设计思想上存在什么问题，等等。第二，目前部、局领导作风以及党群关系存在什么问题，官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义存在什么地方，应当如何改进。第三，工业体制上存在什么问题，以及在基本建设、生产、财务、干部、计划等方面的问题，必须大家动手来检查和解决。第四，各部门的企业管理工作和业务建设上存在什么问题，规章、制度中那些是脱离群众脱离实际的，应该怎样彻底改革。第五，机构紧缩到什么程度，干部怎样下放。第六，关于职工生活福利问题。
    关于整改的方法，这个部要求采用大鸣大放的方法，在全机关里展开一个群众性的自下而上的批评运动，展开一个群众性的大规模的合理化建议运动，展开一个大争大辩的群众运动，通过这个运动来烧掉“三个主义”。吕东在报告中指出，大鸣大放的形式可以多种多样，如召开各式各样的座谈会、个别谈话、促膝谈心等等，特别提倡用大字报来展开大鸣大放大争大辩，用大字报来掀起整改的鸣放高潮。对一些重要问题，如方针政策、体制、紧缩机构等问题，还要进行专题鸣放、专题争辩。这就是要在整改中贯彻群众路线，凡是重要问题，都要经过群众大鸣大放大争大辩来解决。
    吕东在报告中还宣布了在克服官僚主义作风方面决定采取的一些基本措施，号召全体工作人员在大鸣大放中展开讨论。如一部分企业转移给地方管理，在保证统一计划和重点建设的原则下，扩大企业管理权力；彻底精简表格；取消和合并一些重叠的机构，下放一批干部。
    冶金工业部在反右派斗争中贯彻边整边改精神，已经对工作作了许多改进。党和群众的关系比以前更加密切了，各单位接受群众的合理意见开始紧缩了机构，已有20％的司、局长级干部调离部、局机关，并已有五百名干部下放参加生产和管理生产。这些改进都鼓舞了群众对整改的信心。
