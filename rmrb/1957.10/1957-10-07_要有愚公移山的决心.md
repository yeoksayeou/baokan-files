The Qile Agricultural and Forestry Production Cooperative in Leyi County, Guangdong, which is praised in today's newspaper, is a successful example of implementing the "National Agricultural Development Program" draft's Article 40 on "eliminating the four pests." Although the cooperative's patriotic sanitation campaign to increase production failed twice, they were not discouraged. After the third launch in 1953, they persisted for a full five years, finally transforming an impoverished and disease-ridden mountain village into a prosperous new socialist village. Now, even three-year-old children in this village have developed hygienic habits.

It must be admitted that truly eliminating the four pests is indeed a very arduous and meticulous task, requiring great determination and patience, as well as the mobilization of everyone and long-term persistence. Of course, it also requires adapting to local conditions and gradually developing the work in a planned and step-by-step manner. However, some places initially viewed this work as too simple and easy, and after setbacks, they viewed it as too complex and difficult. Some people even created an atmosphere of saying that "eliminating the four pests is impossible." Many places have indeed relaxed this work under this pretext, actually abandoning it.

The successful example of the Qile Agricultural and Forestry Production Cooperative in Leyi County vividly proves that it is not "impossible to eliminate the four pests," but that many people lack the necessary determination and confidence in this arduous task. This successful example is a great encouragement to people. If all counties in the country are determined to first establish such a model cooperative for patriotic sanitation and increased production, and promote their "Foolish Old Man Removing Mountains" spirit throughout the county step by step, then the great plan to eliminate the four pests in the Forty-Article Program will definitely be completed. We have already completed many arduous tasks that predecessors could not complete, and we will certainly be able to complete this arduous task that predecessors could not complete.

    要有愚公移山的决心
    毕谈
    今天本报表扬的广东乐易县岐乐农林生产合作社，是实现“全国农业发展纲要”四十条草案中“除四害”的一个成功的典范。这个社的爱国增产卫生运动虽然两次失败，但是他们并没有灰心，在1953年第三次发动以后，坚持了整整五年，终于使一个贫病交加的山村，变成了人财两旺的社会主义的新村。现在这个村里真是连三岁小孩都养成了卫生的习惯。
    应该承认，要真正消除四害，确实是一件十分艰巨细致的工作，确实需要下很大决心和很大耐心，确实需要人人动员和长期坚持。当然，也需要因地因时制宜，有计划有步骤来逐渐地开展。但是，有些地方开初把这件工作看得太简单太容易，受到挫折以后，又看得太复杂太困难，甚至有人造出一种空气，说什么“除四害办不到”。不少地方确实在这种借口下放松了这个工作，实际上对这个工作放任自流。
    乐易县岐乐农林生产合作社的成功事例，生动地证明，并不是“除四害办不到”，而是很多人对这一艰巨的工作缺乏应有的决心和信心。这一成功的事例，对人们是一个很大的鼓舞。如果全国各县都下决心先搞这样一个爱国增产的卫生运动模范社，发扬他们这种“愚公移山”的精神，在全县逐步推广，那么，四十条纲要中除四害的伟大计划是一定可以完成的。我们已经完成了前人不能完成的很多艰巨的工作，我们也一定能完成前人不能完成的这一件艰巨工作。
