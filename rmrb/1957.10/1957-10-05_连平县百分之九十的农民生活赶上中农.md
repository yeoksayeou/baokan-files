Ninety Percent of Lianping County's Farmers' Lives Catch Up with Middle Peasants
Wu Erxiang

As a result of the summer harvest distribution this year in Lianping County, Guangdong Province, 98.7% of the agricultural cooperatives in the county increased production, 92.5% of the cooperative members increased their income, and the living standards of 90% of the cooperative members have reached the living standards of local middle peasants.

In the first year of cooperation – 1956 – the total grain output of Lianping County reached more than 1.24 million dan, an increase of 15.3% compared to 1955 and 57.3% compared to 1952. The average grain yield per mu in the county increased from 600 jin in 1952 to 819 jin. According to the requirements of the state's First Five-Year Plan, Lianping County was to achieve a total grain output of more than 1.23 million dan by the end of 1957. This target has been exceeded one year ahead of schedule.

As a result, Lianping County has transformed from a grain-deficient county that lacked grain for two months each year into a surplus grain county with a surplus of 120,000 dan of grain annually.

The improvement in the grain situation has created a material foundation for developing diversified operations and comprehensively developing production. This year, the county allocated 6,000 mu of paddy fields to expand the planting area of cash crops, and cash crops also experienced an overall increase in production. Sideline production increased more than threefold compared to the same period last year.

Lianping County was originally an impoverished mountainous county. Before liberation, it suffered from disasters every year, with thousands of farmers displaced, and farmers who regularly ate wild vegetables and drank thin gruel to stave off hunger were a common sight everywhere. Now, the face of the impoverished mountainous area has undergone fundamental changes.

Grasp the Leadership of Production and Cooperation

The change in the impoverished face of Lianping County is the result of the Party's continuous strengthening of its leadership over rural work and the full exploitation of the superiority of cooperation.

In 1953, after the land reform was completed, the Lianping County Committee of the Communist Party of China explicitly made the development of agricultural production the focus of its leadership. The County Party Secretary personally took charge of rural work, and five County Committee members resided permanently in five districts, providing specific guidance. The District Committee members also made specific divisions of labor, with the District Party Secretary taking charge of the overall work of the district, and other District Committee members in charge of one township or one unit (three townships) each. During the busy farming season, each township had a County Committee member or District Committee member to help lead production; during the slack farming season, each unit had at least one County Committee member or District Committee member. This ensured the Party's leadership over rural work.

Over the past few years, the County Committee has consistently regarded the mutual aid and cooperation movement as the focus of the Party's work in rural areas. After the land reform in 1953, the County Committee, while actively calling on farmers throughout the county to organize, first conducted a pilot program for the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Guanpi Township. Afterwards, pilot programs were conducted level by level and expanded year by year. By the spring ploughing season this year, the number of farmer households that had joined cooperatives had expanded to account for 97.3% of the total number of farmer households. The successful completion of agricultural cooperation has opened up a broad path for the development of agricultural production in Lianping County.

In order to overcome the generalism and bureaucratic work style in the leadership of agricultural production, the County Committee selected Xindong Township in the first district and Guanpi Township in the fourth district as key townships. Any major measures in agricultural production were first tested in the key townships, and after achievements were made, the masses were organized to observe and evaluate; at the same time, experienced farmers from areas with different natural conditions throughout the county were invited to hold symposiums to solicit their opinions. Finally, the measures were discussed and approved at the County Committee meeting and implemented. The Party organizations at the district and township levels also had their own key townships, cooperatives, or production teams. At the same time, based on the fact that cadres did not understand production, the County Committee particularly emphasized that cadres must delve into the production process, familiarize themselves with the local production characteristics, study production techniques, and implement the principle of "leading production with production." Therefore, over the past few years, many county and district cadres who went to the countryside have maintained the excellent work style of eating, living, and working with the farmers as they did during the land reform. This spring, based on the Party Central Committee's instructions on cadres participating in physical labor, the County Committee formulated two more regulations. One regulation stipulated that township and cooperative cadres who were not engaged in production must spend 30% of their time participating in physical labor; county and district cadres must spend four or five days each month participating in physical labor. The other regulation stipulated that all rural cadres must cooperate with the masses to cultivate high-yield demonstration fields. These two regulations not only played a significant role in changing the cadres' leadership style, strengthening ties with the masses, and studying production techniques, but also greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for production.

Conscientiously Carry Out Agricultural Technology Reform

Lianping County has more than 2 million mu of land, but only more than 230,000 mu are cultivated land, and the rest are high mountains and ridges. It is almost impossible to expand the area of cultivated land. The existing cultivated land was cultivated extensively, and the yield was very low. Therefore, the County Committee believed that the only way to solve the grain problem was to increase the yield per unit area.

The low yield per unit area of grain was mainly due to the poor fertility of the soil, with low-yielding barren land accounting for two-fifths of the total area. At the same time, cultivation was extensive, and natural disasters occurred year after year. Based on these characteristics, the County Committee believed that to increase the yield per unit area of grain, it was first necessary to improve the soil and increase its fertility. The main method was to increase the application of organic fertilizers.

Lianping County has many mountains and ridges, and green grass and leaves are everywhere. Wild green manure is inexhaustible; because it is close to the mountains, firewood is not lacking, and the straw of various crops can be returned to the fields as fertilizer, as well as pond mud and other miscellaneous soil fertilizers. Accumulating fertilizer is very convenient. However, it was not easy for the masses to accept this approach. In 1953, the Red Star Cooperative, which was established in the winter, applied a large amount of commercial fertilizer in order to strive for a bumper harvest in 1954. This year, the yield of rice per mu increased from 870 jin to 1,003 jin, creating the county's first rice cooperative with a yield of 1,000 jin. However, because too much commercial fertilizer was applied, although the yield per mu increased by 133 jin of grain, buying commercial fertilizer cost 160 jin of grain. The cooperative members said with dissatisfaction, "The increase in production is large, but the income is small, like a rat's tail, it is swollen, but it is limited." The cooperative's cadres learned a lesson from this and changed this approach the following year. In order to reduce costs, they looked for fertilizer sources everywhere, and sent people to the remote mountains 40 li away to cut mountain grass for green manure. They also used methods such as returning rice straw to the fields and planting green manure crops to solve the fertilizer problem. According to statistics from the agricultural department, the average amount of various miscellaneous soil fertilizers and green manure collected per mu in 1954 was only 25 dan, but in 1956, it had increased to an average of 80 dan per mu. The result of applying a large amount of organic fertilizer not only improved the soil fertility, turning more than 70,000 mu of low-yielding barren land into fertile land, ensuring the annual increase in grain yield per unit area, but also reduced production costs year by year.

On the basis of improving the soil, promoting a series of technical reforms centered on close planting with small clumps was also one of the key factors in achieving annual increases in production. According to statistics, close planting with small clumps of early rice has reached 98% in the county this year; the area using improved varieties has also reached 86% of the total rice area, which has played a significant role in increasing production.

Drought is the greatest threat to grain production in Lianping County. In order to eliminate the threat of drought, starting in 1953, the County Committee focused on the areas that had been most affected by drought in previous years and launched a water conservancy construction campaign. From 1955 to the first half of this year, the county used more than 1 million workdays to build, expand, and repair more than 2,000 medium-sized and small water conservancy projects. The county's existing 200,000 mu of paddy fields have basically achieved the goal of not being affected by drought for 30 days. The widespread drought has been basically eliminated.

Develop a Diversified Economy with Grain as the Mainstay

Actively carrying out diversified operations and comprehensively developing production on the basis of striving for annual increases in grain production is a key measure for Lianping County to ensure that 90% of the agricultural cooperatives increase production, 90% of the cooperative members increase their income, and 90% of the cooperative members reach the living standards of middle peasants.

Lianping County is located in a mountainous area. Of the county's 2.01 million mu of land, forest land accounts for more than 1.43 million mu. It not only has abundant forestry resources, but also has many local specialties. Before May of last year, Lianping County's diversified operations were not done well. On the one hand, it was because the grain problem had not been solved, and on the other hand, it was because the cadres had a single-minded leadership style, focusing on grain production and neglecting diversified operations.

The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly pointed out this shortcoming. At the Party's first congress held in May of last year, this shortcoming was criticized based on the instructions of the Provincial Committee. After discussion, the delegates unanimously agreed that Lianping County has a large population and little land, and the mountain resources are very rich, so it is necessary to vigorously develop diversified operations. After the Party Congress, the county established a sideline production office, which was led by a County Party Secretary and two Deputy County Heads. At the same time, it was stipulated that the district heads, township heads, and deputy directors of cooperatives should be specifically responsible for leading sideline production; agricultural cooperatives should allocate appropriate manpower to engage in sideline production.

With the support of the Party and the government in many ways, Lianping County's diversified operations have developed rapidly. Last year, the sideline income in the second half of the year increased by about three times compared to the first half of the year; in the first half of this year, the county's cash income from sideline production reached more than 2.06 million yuan, which is equal to the county's sideline income for the entire year last year.

Recently, the County Committee, based on the spirit of the Provincial Committee's Mountain Area Work Conference, conducted another study on further developing the economy of the mountainous areas. It was initially decided that in the future, Lianping County's grain production, while ensuring the needs of the county's population growth and the grain needs for developing sideline production, will devote more effort to developing the mountainous areas.

    连平县百分之九十的农民生活赶上中农
    吴尔祥
    广东连平县今年夏收分配的结果，全县98·7％的农业社增产，92.5％的社员增加收入，90％的社员生活水平已经达到了当地中农的生活水平。
    合作化的第一年——1956年，连平全县粮食总产量达到了一百二十四万多担，比1955年增产15.3％，比1952年增产57.3％；全县平均每亩粮食产量由1952年的六百斤提高到了八百一十九斤。按照国家第一个五年计划的要求，连平县在1957年末，粮食总产量要达到一百二十三万多担。这个指标，已经提前一年超额完成了。
    这样，连平县就由一个每年缺粮两个月的缺粮县，变成了一个每年有余粮十二万担的余粮县。
    粮食情况的好转，为开展多种经营，全面发展生产创造了物质基础。今年全县拿出六千亩稻田扩大经济作物的种植面积，经济作物也全面增产了。副业生产比去年同期增加三倍以上。
    连平县原是一个贫困的山区县，解放前年年闹灾荒，成千成万的农民流离失所，常年吃野菜、喝粥水充饥的农民到处可见。现在，贫困的山区面貌发生了根本的变化。
    抓住对生产和合作化的领导
    连平县贫困面貌的改变，是党不断加强对农村工作的领导，充分发挥了合作化的优越性的结果。
    1953年，土地改革结束后，中共连平县委就明确地以发展农业生产作为领导的重点。县委书记亲自抓农村工作，五个县委委员分别常住在五个区里，具体指导工作。各区委委员也作了具体分工，区委书记抓全区的工作，其他区委分别掌握一个乡或一个单元（三个乡）。农忙的时候，每个乡都有一个县委委员或区委委员帮助领导生产；农闲的时候，一个单元至少也有一个县委委员或区委委员。这就保证了党对农村工作的领导。
    几年来，县委一直把互助合作运动做为党在农村的工作重心。1953年土地改革结束后，县委在积极号召全县农民组织起来的同时，首先在官陂乡试办了红星农业社。以后便逐级试办，逐年扩大，到今年春耕前，入社农户已扩大到占总农户的97.3％。农业合作化的胜利完成，为连平县发展农业生产开辟了广阔的道路。
    为了克服农业生产领导上的一般化和官僚主义作风，县委选择了一区的新东乡和四区的官陂乡做为重点乡，农业生产上任何重大措施，都首先在重点乡试验，做出成绩后，组织群众观摩评比；同时邀请全县不同自然条件的地区的老农民开座谈会，征求他们的意见，最后在县委会上讨论通过，贯彻执行。各区、乡的党组织，也都有自己的重点乡、社或生产队。同时，县委根据干部不懂生产的情况，特别强调干部必须深入生产过程，熟悉当地生产特点，钻研生产技术，贯彻“以生产领导生产”的方针。因此，几年来，许多下乡的县区干部，一直保持着土地改革的时候同农民同吃、同住、同劳动的优良作风。今春，县委根据党中央关于干部参加体力劳动的指示，又作出两条规定。一条规定乡、社脱产干部必须有30％的时间参加体力劳动；县、区干部每月要有四、五天时间参加体力劳动。另一条规定所有的农村干部都要和群众合作搞丰产示范田。这两项规定不但对改变干部领导作风，密切联系群众，钻研生产技术，起了很大作用，而且大大鼓舞了群众的生产热情。
    切实进行农业技术改革
    连平县二百多万亩土地面积，耕地只有二十三万多亩，其他都是高山大岭，扩大耕地面积几乎是不可能的。而原有的耕地，耕作粗放，产量很低。因此县委认为解决粮食问题，唯一的出路就是提高单位面积产量。
    粮食单位面积产量低，主要原因是土地肥力差，低产的瘦田占了五分之二，同时耕作粗放，自然灾害连年不断。县委根据这些特点，认为提高粮食单位面积产量，首先要改良土壤，提高土地肥力，主要办法就是增施有机质肥料。
    连平山岭很多，到处都是青草绿叶，野生绿肥是取之不尽的；因为近山，柴火不缺，各种作物的稿秆可以回田做肥料，还有塘泥等土杂肥。积肥是十分方便的。但是要群众接受这样做法也不是太容易的事。1953年冬办成的红星社，他们为了争取1954年的丰收，施用了大量的商品肥，这一年每亩稻谷产量由八百七十斤提高到一千零三斤，创造了全县第一个水稻千斤社。可是由于施用商品肥太多，虽然每亩增产一百三十三斤谷，但买商品肥却用了一百六十斤谷。社员都不满地说：“增产大，收入少，像老鼠尾巴，尽肿也有限。”社的干部从这里获得了教训，第二年才改变了这种作法。他们为了降低成本，到处找肥源，派人到四十里外的深山里去割山草做绿肥。还利用稻秸回田和种植绿肥作物等办法解决肥料问题。据农业部门统计，1954年积集的各种土杂肥和绿肥平均每亩只二十五担，1956年平均每亩已提高到八十担。大量增施有机质肥料的结果，不但提高了地力，使七万多亩的低产瘦田改变为良田，保证了粮食单位面积逐年增产，而且使生产成本逐年降低。
    在改良土壤的基础上，推广以小科密植为中心的一系列技术改革，也是取得逐年增产的关键之一。据统计，今年早稻小科密植全县已达到98％；采用良种的面积也达到占水稻总面积的86％，这对增产起了不少作用。
    旱灾对连平县粮食增产威胁最大。为了消灭旱灾的威胁，从1953年开始，县委就抓住了历年受旱的重灾区，开展兴修水利运动。从1955年到今年上半年，全县共用了一百多万个工，新建、扩建、修建的中小型水利工程二千多宗。全县现有的二十万亩水田，已经基本做到受旱三十天不受影响。普遍的旱灾基本上消灭了。
    以粮食为主发展多种经济
    在争取粮食逐年增产的基础上，积极开展多种经营，全面发展生产，是连平县保证90％的农业社增加生产，90％的社员增加收入，90％的社员达到中农生活水平的一条关键措施。
    连平县地处山区，全县二百零一万亩的土地，林地占了一百四十三万多亩。不但有丰富的林业资源，而且有很多土特产。去年5月以前，连平县的多种经营工作是做得不好的。一方面是因为粮食问题没有解决，另一方面是因为干部有单一化的领导作风，抓了粮食生产，忽视了多种经营。
    中共广东省委及时指出了他们这个缺点。他们在去年5月间召开的党的第一次代表大会上，根据省委指示，批判了这个缺点。代表们经过讨论，一致认为连平县人多地少，山区资源非常丰富，必须大力开展多种经营。党代会后，县里成立了副业生产办公室，由一个县委书记、两个副县长专责领导。同时规定各区长、乡长和社的副主任专门负责领导副业生产；农业社要抽出适当人力搞副业生产。
    在党和政府的多方面支持下，连平县的多种经营工作迅速发展起来了。去年下半年副业收入比上半年增加了三倍左右；今年上半年全县副业现金收入达二百零六万多元，等于去年全年的副业收入。
    最近，县委根据省委山区工作会议的精神，对进一步发展山区的经济又作了一次研究。初步决定，今后连平县的粮食生产，在保证本县人口增长和发展副业生产用粮的需要的基础上，将以更多的力量从事开发山区的工作。
