Xinhua News Agency, October 28th. The "Italian Film Week," jointly sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the China Film Workers Association, opened on the evening of October 28th at the Capital Cinema in Beijing.

The Italian film delegation, headed by Hugo Gasi Raggi, which arrived here on the 27th, was invited to attend the opening ceremony. Mr. and Mrs. Della Gini, members of the Italian Friendly Visiting Delegation currently visiting Beijing, were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.

Cai Chusheng, Chairman of the China Film Workers Association, delivered the opening speech. He extended a warm welcome to the Italian film delegation for coming to China to participate in the various activities of the Film Week. He said that from 1954 to last year, seven Italian films, including "Bicycle Thieves," have been screened in China. Up to now, over 20 million people across the country have seen these films. Italian neo-realist films have left a deep impression on Chinese audiences. The three films to be screened during this Film Week, including "Police and Thieves," will also be warmly welcomed by Chinese audiences.

Gulado Sofia, a representative of the Italian film delegation, then spoke. He said that he had traveled to China as a journalist twenty-five years ago. At that time, he came with a sense of curiosity. This time, however, he is deeply attracted by the new Chinese society under construction. Sofia said that like Chinese films, Italian films are also nourished by the spirit of liberation. Their arrival this time is with the mission of the Italian film industry, especially all the staff in the films screened in this Film Week. They are eager to learn more about Chinese films.

At the opening ceremony, Hugo Gasi Raggi, head of the Italian film delegation, also presented the award won by the Chinese film "Magic Brush," which participated in the Venice Film Festival last year, to Wang Lanxi, Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture.

Also present at the opening ceremony were Xia衍, Vice Minister of Culture, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries, Vice Presidents Zhao Yimin and Yang Hansheng, and others.

After the opening ceremony, the Italian film delegation also watched the Italian film "Police and Thieves" with the Chinese audience. Tomorrow afternoon, members of the Italian film delegation will meet with Beijing audiences at the Jiaodaokou Cinema and the Soviet Exhibition Center Cinema.

    新华社28日讯　由中国人民对外文化协会和中国电影工作者联谊会联合举办的“意大利电影周”28日晚在北京首都电影院举行开幕式。
    27日到达这里的以雨果·加西拉奇为首的意大利电影代表团，应邀出席了开幕式。应邀出席开幕式的还有正在北京访问的意大利友好访华代表团人员德拉齐尼夫妇。
    中国电影工作者联谊会主席蔡楚生致开幕词。他对来中国参加电影周各项活动的意大利电影代表团表示热烈欢迎。他说，从1954年到去年，在中国先后放映了“偷自行车的人”等七部意大利影片。到现在为止，全国看过这些影片的观众，已达到两千多万人次。意大利的新现实主义电影，在中国观众的心目中留下了很深的印象。在这次电影周中所要放映的“警察与小偷”等三部影片，也将受到中国观众的热烈欢迎。
    意大利电影代表团代表谷拉铎·索非亚接着讲话。他说，二十五年前他曾经以新闻记者的身份到中国旅行过。那时，他是抱着一种好奇心而来的。而这次，他却是深深地受着正在建设中的中国新社会所吸引。索非亚说，同中国电影一样，意大利电影也是受解放精神所滋养的。他们这次的到来，是负着意大利电影界，特别是在这次电影周上映影片中的所有的工作人员的使命而来的。他们热望能够多了解中国电影。
    在开幕式上，意大利电影代表团团长雨果·加西拉奇还把去年参加威尼斯电影节的中国影片“神笔”所获得的奖品，转交给了文化部电影事业管理局局长王阑西。
    出席开幕式的还有文化部副部长夏衍，中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南、副会长赵毅敏和阳翰笙等人。
    在开幕式后，意大利电影代表团还同中国观众一起，观看了意大利影片“警察与小偷”。明天下午，意大利电影代表团人员将到交道口电影院和苏联展览馆电影馆同北京观众见面。
