Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Beijing—On the 17th, Beijing No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Mill announced that it would reduce its existing 543 management personnel to 325. After the implementation of this measure, the proportion of management personnel in this factory to the total number of employees will decrease to 5.37%.

When Beijing No. 2 Cotton Mill started production in 1954, it paid relatively close attention to controlling the number of management personnel, with management personnel accounting for 9.92% of the total number of employees. Some cotton mills in Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Shijiazhuang, which are of similar size and started production at the same time as this factory, have more management personnel than this factory.

According to the organizational streamlining plan announced today, the factory's existing fourteen sections will be merged into five sections. The management organizations of the weaving and spinning branches will be abolished, and the factory director will directly lead the production work of the workshops. In the past, there was serious buck-passing between sections in this factory. For a worker to move from one workshop to another, it had to go through five approval procedures from the finance section, education section, and so on. After these sections are merged, the transfer of workers will only require the consent of the workshop. In the past, factory-level cadres had to go through two branch organizations to lead workshop production; section personnel had to go through the branch before going to the workshop to work; and workshops and branches also had to go through the branch to contact work. After these two branch organizations are abolished, work efficiency can be greatly improved.

### 北京国棉二厂管理人员又减少五分之二

    北京国棉二厂管理人员又减少五分之二
    据新华社讯　北京国营第二棉纺织厂十七日宣布把现有的五百四十三个管理人员减少到三百二十五人。实现这一措施以后，这个厂的管理人员占全体职工总数的比例，将下降到5.37％。
    北京国棉二厂在1954年开工生产时，就比较注意控制管理人员的数量，管理人员占职工总数的比重是9.92％。同这个厂规模相等并且是同时开工生产的郑州、西安和石家庄等地的一些棉纺织厂，管理人员都比这个厂多。
    按照今天宣布的紧缩机构的方案，这个厂现有的十四个科室将合并成五个科室。织布、纺纱两个分场的管理机构取消，由厂长直接领导车间的生产工作。过去，这个厂科室与科室之间扯皮现象很严重，一个工人从这个车间到另一个车间，要经过财务科、教育科等五道批准手续。这些科室合并以后，调动工人只要车间同意就行了。过去厂一级干部领导车间生产都要通过两个分场机构；科室人员下车间工作，先要经过分场；车间和分场联系工作也要通过分场。这两个分场机构取消以后，工作效率可以大大提高。
