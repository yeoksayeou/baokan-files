　　In the Barber Shop
　　Gao Xingya
　　After finishing breakfast on Sunday, I went to the barber cooperative to get a haircut. Entering, I saw the members busy sweeping the floor, wiping mirrors, and tidying up their tools. Some were posting wall newspapers, registering labor competition and attendance rates. I asked when they would start working, and they said eight o'clock, asking me to sit down and wait for ten minutes. Afraid that there would be no seats if I came back later, I picked up a newspaper and sat down on a white swivel chair by the window. I wanted to concentrate on reading the newspaper, but I was drawn in by the members' conversations…

　　"I think Gao Peng was right at the meeting yesterday. With a family of seven or eight, earning only fifty or sixty yuan a month, how can they make a living without doing some odd jobs in the morning and evening?" said a member who looked about fifty years old.

　　"Brother Zhang! That's trying to ride two horses at once, it's not reliable!" said one in his thirties.

　　"People have difficulties in life, they always have to think of ways."

　　"Difficulties, the cooperative helps. Old Li in our group hasn't been working for more than two months because of illness, but his family hasn't gone hungry, hasn't the cooperative been subsidizing him?"

　　"Why did Old Tong quit the cooperative? Isn't it because of financial difficulties?" Old Zhang, who was in his fifties, said again.

　　"I see him carrying a small bag every day, going through the streets and alleys looking for odd jobs, but he hasn't solved much of his financial difficulties!" said a young man in his twenties.

　　"We should believe in the Party's policies and take the road of cooperativization, and never develop towards capitalism," said the member in his thirties.

　　"I understand that," Old Zhang nodded.

　　"Group leader, haven't you been present every day for two years since cooperativization? The perfect attendance award must be yours!" the young man in his twenties changed the subject.

　　"That's a small matter, but everyone in our group must maintain the cleanliness banner," said the one in his thirties.

　　"Not only must the cleanliness banner be maintained, but we must also find a way to win the exceeding-the-task banner!" another young man said with confidence.

　　"I was absent for five days this year, I'm afraid it will have an impact, right? In the future, I will learn from the group leader and strive to never be absent."

　　"I was absent for two days this month, I'm afraid it will also have an impact, I have to think of a way in the future!"

　　"In the future, as long as we all work hard, we can make up for these deficiencies. It's time, let's get to work!"

　　在理发馆里
　　高兴雅
    星期天吃完早饭，就上理发合作社去理发。进门一看，社员们忙于扫地擦镜子，整理用具，也有的贴墙报，登记劳动竞赛和出勤率。我问什么时间开始工作，他们说八点钟，让我坐下等十几分钟。我恐怕再回来没有位置，所以拿起报纸就坐在临窗的一台白转椅上。本想集中精神看报，可是被社员们的谈论所吸引了，……
    “我看，高朋昨天在会上说的对，一家七八口人，一个月只挣五六十元钱，一早一晚不作点零活儿，哪能维持得了生活？”一个约摸五十多岁的社员说。
    “张大哥！那是脚踩两只船，不牢靠啊！”一个三十多岁的说。
    “人家生活困难，总得想想办法”
    “困难，社里帮助，咱组的老李不是因为生病已经休息了两个多月了，全家也没挨饿，还不是社里补助的吗？”
    “你说老佟为啥退社？还不是因为生活困难吗？”五十多岁的老张又说。
    “我看他每天挟个小包，走大街穿小巷找零活，生活上的困难也没解决多少呀！”一个二十多岁的青年人说。
    “我们应该相信党的政策，走合作化道路，决不应该向资本主义发展。”三十多岁的那个社员说。
    “这个我明白。”老张点头说。
    “组长，你是不是合作化以来两年没缺勤了，全勤奖一定是你的了！”二十多岁的青年转了话题。
    “那倒是小事，我们组的清洁卫生旗大家可得保持住。”那个三十多岁的说。
    “不但清洁卫生旗要保持住，超额完成任务旗也要想法夺过来！”又一个青年满怀信心地说。
    “我一年就缺了五天，恐怕有影响吧？今后要向组长看齐，争取永不缺勤。”
    “我一个月缺了两天，恐怕也有影响，我以后也得想个办法了！”
    “今后我们大家只要努力，就能弥补这些缺欠。时间到了，咱们做活儿吧！”
