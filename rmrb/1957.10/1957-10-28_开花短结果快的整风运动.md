A Rectification Movement with Quick Blooming and Fast Results
By our reporter Zhong Lin

    Like many factories, the workers of the Tianjin Tractor Factory have also thrown themselves into the high tide of full and frank expression these days. Long-standing problems, both large and small, have been exposed in succession through big-character posters or group meetings, and problems that have long been unresolved are now beginning to be resolved. The solution of one problem also encourages the workers' enthusiasm for work. Everyone praises this rectification movement as truly "quick blooming and fast results." Here, I will only talk about a few small things in the early stage of the factory's rectification movement. Although it is "peeking at the leopard through a tube," it is indeed "seeing the spots."

    Problems Unresolved for Years Have Been Resolved
    The chrysanthemum tool holders used on the lathes in the machining workshop were not complete in specifications. Some tools did not have suitable tool holders to clamp, so they used broken tool holders to make do. When installing and removing tools, they had to hammer, which not only delayed production but also easily damaged the machines. For two or three years, the workers in the machining workshop have been constantly making suggestions, requesting that the specifications of the chrysanthemum tool holders be complete. The process design section dragged on the modification of the design and drawings for a long time, and it was not until this spring that they finally designed it and handed it over to the tool workshop for manufacturing. For several months, although the tool workshop had included the production of chrysanthemum tool holders in its plan, other tasks were tight, so the plan to make chrysanthemum tool holders was squeezed out, so it has not started yet. On September 15, the second day of the factory's rectification movement, a big-character poster posted by the workers appealed to the factory director: "The chrysanthemum tool holders used on the lathes in the factory have been proposed for two or three years, and have not been resolved yet. Can you watch the machine tools be damaged?" The rectification office forwarded this opinion to the director of the tool workshop and asked him to reply. The director of the tool workshop thought to himself: "The production tasks have already been arranged like radishes in a pit, where is there time to make chrysanthemum tool holders!" But after discussing with the old workers in the workshop, the old workers said that they could still squeeze out time to make them. After research, the task of making chrysanthemum tool holders was assigned to the tool group. After discussion, the workers in the tool group immediately allocated forces to rush to make them. On September 17, the first set of chrysanthemum tool holders was sent to the machining workshop, and the tool group also guaranteed to deliver three more sets on September 20, and all eight sets would be delivered by the end of September.

    "We Have Time to Help You!"
    Since the brand-new chrysanthemum tool holders were delivered, the machining workshop has also set off a wave of improving work. The environmental hygiene of the machining workshop was not good, so they immediately started cleaning work and also established a system of cleaning every Saturday. The pressure plate screws used on various lathes in their workshop were not enough, which often delayed production and also affected the workers' piece-rate wages. The workers were very annoyed, but the problem had been raised countless times, and it had not been resolved for a long time. This time, the workers posted big-character posters criticizing this matter, and the workshop director quickly collected materials to make them, but the forging workshop needed to help make blanks. When the director of the machining workshop went to discuss with the director of the forging workshop, the director of the forging workshop did not shirk responsibility like before, saying that there was no time, but immediately took on the task and guaranteed delivery by the end of the month. This made the director of the machining workshop a little surprised. He asked why they had time to help this time. The director of the forging workshop said: "Since the start of the rectification movement, our workshop's groups that have never completed the plan have been overfulfilling the task every day. How can we not have time to help you now!"

    You Can Go Home in Clean Clothes After Work
    Since the beginning of autumn, the general affairs section has reduced one worker who burns boilers, and the bathhouse is only open for eight hours a day, so two shifts of workers cannot take a bath and change into clean clothes before going home after work. The general affairs section issued four bath tickets per week to each of the workers in these two shifts, asking them to go to designated bathhouses in the city to wash. As a result, many workers had to go home wearing greasy work clothes after work. The workers had repeatedly made suggestions to the general affairs section, believing that issuing bath tickets was not cost-effective for the public and was inconvenient for the workers. They requested to restore the original method, so that workers in three shifts day and night could take a bath after work. But the general affairs section just did not adopt the workers' opinions. This time, the workers posted big-character posters to criticize the general affairs section and suggested restoring the method of opening the bathhouse all day, so that workers in three shifts could take a bath after work. After research and asking for instructions from the leadership, the comrades in the general affairs section decided to accept the workers' opinions and restored the practice of opening the bathhouse all day the next day, and announced this decision on big-character posters.

    开花短结果快的整风运动
    本报记者　钟林
    和许多工厂一样，天津拖拉机制造厂的职工们，这些天来也投入了大鸣大放的高潮中。长期存在着的一些大大小小的问题，陆续被大字报或小组会揭发出来了，长期没得到解决的问题，现在开始得到解决了。一个问题的解决，也鼓舞着工人的干活劲头。大家都称道这次整风运动，真是“开花短，结果快”。这里只讲这个厂整风初期的几件小事，虽然是“管中窥豹”，但的确也还是“可见一斑”。
    几年不能解决的问题解决了
    机械加工车间旋床上用的菊花刀盘，因为规格不齐全，有的刀具没有合适的刀盘来卡，就用坏刀盘来凑合，上下刀具的时候，就得用锤子敲敲打打，这不仅耽误了生产，还容易损坏机器。两三年来，机械加工车间的工人就不断地提出意见，要求把菊花刀盘的规格配齐。这件事，工艺设计科修改设计和图纸拖拖拉拉拖了好久，今年春天才好容易设计好，交给工具车间去制造了。几个月来，工具车间虽然都把菊花刀盘的制作列入计划，但其他任务一紧，就把制作菊花刀盘的计划挤掉了，所以一直还没有开始作。厂里开始整风的第二天，9月15日，职工们贴出的一张大字报向厂长呼吁道：“全厂旋床上所用的菊花刀盘已提出两三年了，到现在还没有解决，你能看着机床受损坏吗？”整风办公室把这个意见转给工具车间主任，要他答复。工具车间主任心里想：“生产任务已经是一个萝卜一个坑地排好了，哪有时间作菊花刀盘呀！”但和车间的老工人一商量，老工人说还可以挤时间做出来。经过研究以后，就把做菊花刀盘的任务交给刀具组了。刀具组的工人一商量，就马上调配力量动手赶制。9月17日，做好的第一套菊花刀盘就给机械加工车间送去了，而且刀具组还保证9月20日再交三套，9月底把八套全都交齐。
    “我们有时间帮你们的忙了！”
    自从崭新的菊花刀盘送来以后，机械加工车间也掀起了改进工作的热潮。机械加工车间的环境卫生不好，他们就立即动手进行了清洁工作，还订出了每星期六进行清扫的制度。他们车间各种车床上用的压板螺丝不够用，常常耽误生产，也影响了工人们的计件工资收入，工人们很恼火，但问题提了不知多少回，也是长期没有得到解决。这一回，工人们贴出大字报批评了这件事，车间主任赶快领了料来要做，但需要锻工车间给帮忙做毛胚。当机械加工车间主任找锻工车间主任商量时，锻工车间主任不像以往那样推说没有时间了，而是马上满口承担下来，并且保证月底交活。这使得机械加工车间主任有点惊奇了，他问这次为什么就有时间帮忙了呢，锻工车间主任说：“整风开始以来，我们车间连一向完不成计划的小组都天天超额完成任务了，现在怎么会没时间帮你们的忙呢”！
    下班后可以换上干净衣服回家了
    入秋以来，总务科把烧锅炉的工人减少了一个，澡塘每天只开放八小时，因而有两个班的工人下了班，就不能洗了澡换上干净衣服才回家。总务科给这两个班的工人每人每周发四张洗澡票，要他们到市内指定的澡塘里去洗。这样一来，不少的工人们下了班，还得穿着油腻腻的工作服回家。工人们不止一次地到总务科提意见，认为发洗澡票对公家不合算，对工人也不方便，要求恢复原来的办法，让一昼夜三个班的工人下了班都可以洗澡。但总务科就是不采纳工人们的意见。这次，工人贴出大字报来批评了总务科，并建议恢复澡塘整天开放的办法，让三个班的工人下了班都能洗澡。总务科的同志们经过研究并请示领导后，决定接受工人们的意见，第二天就恢复澡塘整天开放的作法，并且在大字报上公布了这个决定。
