    Housing Built with Workers' Sweat and Blood
    How Can Not Paying Rent Be Considered Selfish?
    Yesterday, after reading the article signed "Representative" in our factory's small newspaper, I felt very angry.

    Our Party has led the people's revolution for thirty years, and many martyrs shed blood and sacrificed themselves, precisely for the happiness of the broad masses of the people, wasn't it? Now, the houses we workers live in, the public gives rent subsidies, this is entirely a worker's welfare, how can it be said that we are taking advantage of the public! How are the houses that workers live in built? Isn't it from the factory director's fund obtained by us workers through years of hard work and sweating, and exceeding our tasks? And bonuses? Union dues? In the eight years since liberation, our factory's production has increased so much, how can it be said that the state giving workers a little rent subsidy is workers being selfish! I think the person who said this doesn't seem like a member of the working class, otherwise, why would they still want workers to live that poor life?

    The average wage of workers is more than seventy yuan, but the only ones who can truly receive more than seventy yuan are level six workers. Think about it, how many level six workers are there on-site! The majority of workers cannot get that much salary. Therefore, I suggest: (1) Workers' rent subsidies should continue to be issued as before; (2) Reduce the wages of cadres.

    住宅由工人血汗造成
    不交房租怎算自私
    昨天，我看到本厂小报上署名“代表”的文章后，感到非常气愤。
    我们党领导人民革命了三十年，许多先烈流血牺牲，不正是为了广大人民的幸福？现在，我们工人住的房子，公家给了房租补贴，这完全是工人的福利，怎能说是沾了公家的便宜！工人住的房子是怎样盖成的？还不是我们工人成年辛苦流汗、超额完成任务得来的厂长基金？还有奖金？工会会费？解放八年来，我们厂的生产提高了那么多，国家给工人拿一点房贴，怎么能说是工人自私！我看说这种话的不像工人阶级中的一员，要不，怎么还想要工人过那穷苦的生活呢？
    工人的平均工资是七十多元，但是真正能拿到七十多元的，只有六级工。想想看，现场的六级工才有多少！大多数的工人都拿不了那么多工资。因此，我建议：（1）工人的房贴仍然照发；（2）减少干部的工资。
