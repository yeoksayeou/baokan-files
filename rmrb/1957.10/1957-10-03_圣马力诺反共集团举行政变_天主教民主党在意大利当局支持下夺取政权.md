Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd: According to reports in Roman newspapers, the Christian Democratic Party of the Republic of San Marino launched a coup d'état on the morning of October 1st, establishing a new government to oppose the original ruling government jointly led by Communists and left-wing Socialists.

The report stated that the San Marino Christian Democratic Party had "consulted" with leaders of the Italian Christian Democratic Party before taking this illegal action. After the coup, the "new government" immediately received "recognition" from the Italian government.

Currently, the Republic of San Marino, which is entirely surrounded by Italian territory, has had its connections with the outside world severed, as Italian police have closed all roads leading to the republic.

This coup was a long-planned event by the San Marino anti-communist group. Since the end of World War II, reactionaries have repeatedly attempted to overthrow the government with Communist participation.

    圣马力诺反共集团举行政变
    天主教民主党在意大利当局支持下夺取政权
    据新华社2日讯  据罗马报纸报道，圣马力诺共和国的天主教民主党1日清晨举行政变，成立了一个新政府来反对原来由共产党人和左翼社会党人联合执政的政府。
    消息说，圣马力诺天主教民主党在采取这一非法行动之前曾经同意大利天主教民主党的领导“磋商”过。政变之后，“新政府”立即获得了意大利政府的“承认”。
    目前这个周围都是意大利国境的圣马力诺共和国同外界的联系已经陷于中断，因为意大利警察封闭了一切通往这个共和国的道路。
    这次政变是圣马力诺反共集团蓄谋已久的事情。自从第二次大战结束以来，反动派一再试图推翻这个有共产党参加的政府。
