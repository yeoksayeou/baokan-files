    Xinhua News Agency, London, 27th: British Prime Minister Macmillan returned to London from Canada today and stated that he does not advocate top-level talks with the Soviet Union at present.

    Macmillan emphasized to reporters at the airport that the West should adhere to the bankrupt "position of strength" policy. He said, "I do not favor high-level talks when talks do not appear to have a hope of success." He also does not advocate negotiations with the Soviet Union on the Middle East issue, believing that only by strengthening the "position of the Free World" and negotiating from that position will there be "fruitful results."

    He boasted that the Anglo-American Washington talks were the "most productive" talks in his "memory," boasting that the joint statement of the two countries was a declaration of Western countries' "interdependence" and "closer cooperation." He believes that the top-level meeting of the North Atlantic Group to be held in December this year marks the beginning of a "new page" in Western "cooperation."

    麦克米伦回到伦敦
    继续吹嘘“实力政策”
    据新华社27日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相麦克米伦今天从加拿大回到伦敦时表示，他在目前不主张同苏联举行最高级的谈判。
    麦克米伦在机场回答记者们的问题时强调西方要坚持破产了的“实力地位”政策。他说：“当会谈看来不会有成功希望的时候，我是不赞成进行高级会谈的。”他也不主张在中东问题上同苏联谈判，他认为只有加强了“自由世界的地位”和从这种地位出发去谈判才会“有成果”。
    他吹嘘这次英美华盛顿会谈是他“记忆”中“最有成效”的一次会谈，吹嘘两国的联合声明是西方国家“相互依赖”和更为“密切合作”的一项声明，他认为今年12月要举行的北大西洋集团的最高级会议就是西方“合作”的“新的一页”的开始。
