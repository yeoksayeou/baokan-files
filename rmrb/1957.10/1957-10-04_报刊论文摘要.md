    The Opposition Between Us and the Rightists on the Issue of Independent Thinking
    Independent thinking in scientific work must first be based on facts, experiments, and practice. Therefore, scientific workers must first master a large number of concrete facts and materials, and study these facts and materials to arrive at new opinions and conclusions, thereby supplementing or revising the original theory. Creative scientific work does not mean sticking to the original theory unchanged. This is true independent thinking. The Chinese Communist Party, based on China's specific conditions, creatively applied and developed Marxism, enabling the Chinese revolution to achieve a great victory, and socialist construction to achieve brilliant achievements. This is the best example of independent thinking. According to the fallacies of the Rightists, anyone who recognizes the truths already affirmed by predecessors does not count as independent thinking. Therefore, in their view, anyone who recognizes the universal truth of Marxism is a "yes-man," a "parrot," or a "blockhead." They can completely obliterate facts, fabricate at will, and reverse right and wrong, calling white black. They can also seize on certain one-sided facts and exaggerate and distort them. This kind of "independent thinking" of theirs is thoroughgoing subjectivism, completely standing on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie. The fundamental difference between us and the Rightists regarding the view of independent thinking, from the perspective of the ideological system, manifests the fundamental opposition between materialism and idealism; from the perspective of political stance, it indicates the fundamental opposition between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. In the eyes of the Rightists, accepting the theoretical guidance of Marxism and accepting the leadership of the Party will hinder independent thinking. In our view, the ideological guidance of Marxism, the leadership of the Party, as well as organization and discipline, not only do not hinder independent thinking, but are precisely the guidelines for us to conduct independent thinking. (Excerpt from "Talk about Independent Thinking" by Wang Zisong, Study Bi-weekly, No. 19, 1957)
    The Criticism of Bourgeois Sociology Is a Political Struggle
    Bourgeois sociology was disseminated in China for decades before liberation. Facts have proven that this "science" is thoroughly anti-Marxist. Their so-called "rural surveys" aimed to devise strategies for the reactionary ruling class to suppress peasant movements; their so-called industrial and mining surveys aimed to devise strategies for the reactionary ruling class to suppress the workers' movement; and their research was also aimed at providing information for imperialist aggression against China. Therefore, bourgeois sociology as a "science" must be fundamentally negated. The problem today is not only that the bourgeois Rightists want to "restore" such a reactionary "science," but more importantly, they want to provide a "theoretical" team and ideological weapons for the Zhang-Luo anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiratorial group to subvert the people's regime under the guise of restoring this "science." Therefore, the current struggle to expose and criticize the bourgeois Rightists' attempt to "restore" the old sociology is not an academic struggle, but a serious political struggle. (Excerpt from "What is the Purpose of the Bourgeois Rightists' Attempt to 'Restore' the Old Sociology?" by Lin Jianqing, Study Bi-weekly, No. 19, 1957)
    Strengthen Party Spirit Tempering, Overcome Individualism
    Generally speaking, comrades within the Party who have serious individualistic thoughts have both correct and incorrect things in their thinking before they degenerate; they contradict and struggle with each other.
    The key is not whether there is individualistic thought, but what attitude is taken towards individualistic thought. Some people, with the help of the Party, can face their own mistakes squarely and use correct thinking to overcome incorrect thinking, thus undergoing transformation and making progress. Some people forgive themselves for their wrong thoughts, do not carry out ideological struggle, and refuse the help of others, so their wrong thoughts develop day by day, and they degenerate politically. For example, there is such a person who, when their individualistic errors are criticized, often says: in theory, ideas can be understood, but in specific problems, ideas are not understood. Therefore, they do not want to make real efforts to transform individualistic thought and establish a revolutionary outlook on life, at most temporarily hiding individualistic thought when the situation is unfavorable. There is an old Chinese philosophical saying: "Studying is like sailing against the current, if you do not advance, you will retreat." Ideological remolding is also like this. If bad thoughts are not overcome through hard work, they will develop. Individualistic thoughts develop to a serious degree and become bourgeois extreme individualists. At this time, they cannot distinguish between right and wrong, because they look at any problem from an individualistic standpoint, and have no common language with the Party. Correct opinions from the Party's and the people's standpoint cannot be heard at all, and are even very repulsive, considering them high-sounding and dogmatic. From this, it can be seen how important it is for a revolutionary and a Communist Party member to constantly strengthen Party spirit tempering and overcome individualistic thoughts; how important it is for a Party organization to constantly strengthen the political and ideological education of its members. For wrong thoughts, we must prevent them before they become serious and not ignore or condone them because they are not yet serious or prominent. There is no insurmountable gap between bourgeois individualistic thoughts and anti-Party and anti-people bourgeois individualistic ambitionists. If individualistic thoughts are not criticized and overcome in a timely and serious manner, cutting off this path, there is a danger of stumbling.

    报刊论文摘要
    我们和右派分子在独立思考问题上的对立
    科学工作中的独立思考，首先必须是根据事实，根据实验和实践，所以科学工作者首先必须掌握大量的具体事实和材料，钻研事实和材料得出一些新的意见和结论，从而补充或者修正原来的理论；创造性的科学工作，不是墨守原来的理论而一成不变。这就是真正的独立思考。中国共产党根据中国的具体情况，创造性地运用和发展了马克思主义，使中国革命取得了伟大的胜利，社会主义建设取得了辉煌的成就，这是独立思考的最好的典范。按照右派分子的谬论，则凡是承认前人已经肯定了的真理，就都不算独立思考。因此，凡是承认马克思主义普遍真理的人，在他们看来就都是“唯唯诺诺、人云亦云”的人，是“木脑瓜”的人。他们可以完全抹煞事实，任意捏造，颠倒是非，将白的说成黑的；他们也可以抓住某些片面的事实，加以夸大歪曲。他们这种“独立思考”是彻头彻尾的主观主义，完全站在资产阶级的反动立场上的。我们和右派分子对于独立思考的看法的根本分歧，从思想体系上说，它表现了唯物主义和唯心主义观点的根本对立；从政治立场上说，它表明了无产阶级立场和资产阶级立场的根本对立。在右派分子看来，接受马克思主义的理论指导，接受党的领导会阻碍独立思考，在我们看来，马克思主义的思想指导、党的领导以及组织性、纪律性等等，非但不阻碍独立思考，恰恰是我们进行独立思考的准绳。  （摘自1957年学习半月刊第十九期汪子嵩：“谈谈独立思考”）
    对资产阶级社会学的批判是一种政治斗争
    资产阶级社会学在解放前曾经在中国传播数十年之久，事实证明，这门“科学”，是彻头彻尾反马克思主义的。他们的所谓“农村调查”，旨在为反动统治阶级镇压农民运动献策；他们的所谓工矿调查，旨在为反动的统治阶级镇压工人运动献策；并且他们的调查研究，也是为帝国主义侵略中国提供资料的。因此资产阶级社会学作为一门“科学”，必须从根本上予以否定。今天的问题不仅在于资产阶级右派要“恢复”如此反动透顶的一门“科学”，而且更重要的还在于他们要在恢复这门“科学”的名义下，为章罗反党反社会主义阴谋集团提供颠覆人民政权的“理论”队伍和思想武器。因此，当前揭发和批判资产阶级右派企图“恢复”旧社会学的斗争，不是学术上的斗争，而是一种严重的政治斗争。  （摘自1957年学习半月刊第十九期林涧青：“资产阶级右派企图‘恢复’旧社会学的目的何在？”）
    加强党性锻炼，克服个人主义
    一般说来，党内有严重个人主义思想的同志在其没有变质以前，他思想上正确的和错误的东西是并有的，它们矛盾着斗争着。
    问题的关键不是个人主义思想的有无，而是对个人主义思想采取什么态度。有的在党的帮助下能够正视自己的错误，用正确思想来克服错误思想，因而有转变有进步。有的人对错误思想自我原谅，自己思想斗争不开展，又拒绝别人的帮助，因而错误思想日益发展，政治上日益蜕化。例如有这样一种人，当他们的个人主义错误受到批评的时候，他们常说：在理论上思想可以通，在具体问题上思想就是不通。所以，他们并不想真正下功夫改造个人主义思想，确立革命人生观，至多在情势不利时把个人主义思想暂时隐蔽起来。中国有一句古老的哲言：“求学如逆水行舟，不进则退。”思想改造也是这样，坏思想如果不努力克服，就要发展。个人主义思想发展到严重程度就成为资产阶级的极端个人主义者。这时候就不辨是非了，因为他看任何问题都站在个人主义立场上，和党没有共同的语言，从党的人民的立场出发的正确意见，他根本听不进去，甚至很反感，认为是高调，是教条主义。由此可以看出，作为一个革命者、一个共产党员，不断加强党性锻炼，克服个人主义思想，是如何的重要；作为一个党组织，不断加强党员的政治思想教育，是如何的重要。对于错误的思想，必须防微杜渐，决不能因其尚不严重、尚不突出而忽视之，姑息放纵。资产阶级个人主义思想同反党反人民的资产阶级个人主义野心家之间，没有不可逾越的鸿沟，如果不及时严肃地批判克服个人主义思想，切断这个路，就存在着失足的危险。  （摘自9月25日安徽日报亦辉：“加强党性锻炼，克服个人主义”）
