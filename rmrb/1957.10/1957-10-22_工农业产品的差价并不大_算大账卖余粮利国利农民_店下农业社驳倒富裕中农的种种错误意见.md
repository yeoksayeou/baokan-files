    (Reported by this newspaper) 社员 of the Dianxia Agricultural Cooperative in Fuding County, Fujian Province, used concrete facts to calculate accounts and make comparisons in the great debate on the grain issue, refuting the erroneous claims of a few prosperous middle peasants who shouted that "the price difference between industrial and agricultural products is too large, and it is not worthwhile to sell grain."
    Prosperous middle peasant Huang Meifan said, "Grain has been worthless since liberation, and it's not worthwhile to sell grain to buy cloth." Poor peasant Zhang Shibao debated with him, saying, "Before liberation, grain prices changed seven or eight times a day. People with money and grain could wait for a good price before selling, but most of us poor peasants had to sell immediately when the rice was harvested, like a fire burning our eyebrows, which just gave the unscrupulous merchants a chance to cut prices, and we didn't get any benefit. After liberation, grain prices stabilized and even increased reasonably. This is beneficial to both us poor peasants and you middle peasants." Regarding the issue of selling grain to buy cloth not being worthwhile, Zhang Shibao said, "In 1947, buying a pair of twill trousers required selling 120 catties of grain, but now selling 100 catties of grain can buy 1 zhang and 9 chi of twill cloth, enough to make a jacket and two pairs of trousers. How can you say it's not worthwhile to sell grain to buy cloth?" After hearing everyone's cloth calculations, another prosperous middle peasant, Xie Shaole, proposed, "The ratio between grain and cloth is not low, but it can't compare with handicrafts and fish." Everyone immediately calculated detailed accounts with him to see whether it was worthwhile or not. The first account was a production account. Locally, one mu of land could yield 320 catties of grain, worth 20 yuan and 1 jiao. After deducting costs, seeds, cattle rent, depreciation of agricultural implements, public accumulation, and management fees, the net income was 12 yuan. Generally, it took ten labor days to cultivate one mu of land, so the average labor day earned 1 yuan and 2 jiao. As for the local handicraft workers making bamboo utensils, the most skilled could make four dustpans a day, which could be sold for 1 yuan and 8 jiao. After deducting costs, taxes, public accumulation, etc., the net income was 9 jiao, which was not higher than the labor remuneration of farmers growing grain. The second account was that the raw materials for handicrafts, such as bamboo and wood, were first bought from farmers. You can't just say that you are spending more money just because the price of handicrafts is high. The third account is that the sales of handicrafts vary between the off-season and the peak season, and they cannot be produced 365 days a year. However, after the agricultural cooperative develops a diversified economy, there is work to do every day, and there is labor remuneration to be earned. As for the comparison between grain prices and fish prices, poor peasant Ji Dingxu stood up and said, "Before liberation, the price of yellow croaker fish also varied, sometimes requiring 20 catties of grain to exchange for 1 catty, and sometimes only 3 catties of grain to exchange for 1 catty. But at that time, poor peasants didn't even have enough to eat, so how could they have the fortune to eat fish? Now grain prices and fish prices are stable. One hundred catties of grain can be exchanged for 30 catties of yellow croaker, which is beneficial to both farmers and fishermen."
    Prosperous middle peasant Xie Xiuchi said, "The power to raise or lower grain prices should be in the hands of the farmers, so that the farmers' lives will improve faster." This statement sparked another debate. Lower-middle peasant Fang Dengchai calculated a big picture account, saying, "Our production team sold 25 dan of grain and 36 dan of sweet potato rice to the state last year, earning a total of 335 yuan. If we had the power to raise or lower prices, let's say we raised it by 20%, then we could sell for 67 yuan more. But later, we bought back 20 dan of grain and 13 dan of rice, totaling 271 yuan. If the power to raise or lower these grain prices was in the hands of private merchants, and we also calculated it at a 20% increase, then we would have to pay 54 yuan and 2 jiao more. Secondly, last year, our team of 16 households made a total of 10 new cotton clothes, 2 wool clothes, 30 single clothes, and 2 cotton quilts, and also bought some rubber shoes and woolen hats, totaling 314 yuan. If the power to raise or lower the prices of these goods was in the hands of capitalists, let's say they raised them by 20%, then we would have to pay 62 yuan and 8 jiao more. Just looking at these three buying and selling accounts, our team would have to spend 50 yuan more. You see, can farmers improve their lives if the power to raise or lower grain prices is in the hands of the farmers themselves?" After this account was calculated, everyone said, "Once grain prices move, everything rises. In the end, the farmers still suffer." Cai A'nuan, the production team leader, who originally had ideological problems, said on the spot after the comparative education of several big picture accounts: "We will go back and calculate, and even if we have one catty of surplus grain, we will sell it to the state." As a result, in addition to selling more than 6,000 catties of surplus grain distributed by the cooperative, this team also handed over an additional 3,800 catties of grain to the cooperative for unified disposal. Chen Bijin and Zhou Sanyi, prosperous middle peasants who had withdrawn from the cooperative to avoid unified grain purchase, were invited to participate in this great debate, improved their understanding, saw the future grain situation clearly, and also expressed their intention to reapply for membership in the cooperative.

    工农业产品的差价并不大
    算大账卖余粮利国利农民
    店下农业社驳倒富裕中农的种种错误意见
    本报讯  福建福鼎县店下农业社社员在粮食问题大辩论中，用具体事实进行算账、对比，驳倒少数富裕中农叫喊“工农业产品差价太大，卖粮食不合算”的错误说法。
    富裕中农黄美泛说“解放以后粮食不值钱，卖粮买布不合算”。贫农张时保和他辩论说：“解放前粮价一天七、八变，有钱有粮的人可以坐看一个好价钱才卖，我们大多数贫苦农民一到割稻子时，好比火烧眉毛，立即就卖，刚好给奸商杀价，一点好处也没有。解放以后，粮价稳定，还有合理提高。这对我们贫农和你们中农都是有利的。”对于卖粮买布不合算问题，张时保说：“1947年，买一条斜纹裤子要卖一百二十斤谷子，现在卖一百斤谷子即可买一丈九尺斜纹布，足够缝制一件上衣两条裤，怎么能说卖粮买布不合算呢？”另一个富裕中农谢绍乐听了大家算布账后又提出：“粮食和布比不低，要是和手工业品和鱼货比就比不过。”大家随即再和他算细账，比比看到底合算不合算？第一笔算生产账，当地一亩田可收三百二十斤谷子，值二十元一角，除成本、种籽、牛租、农具折旧、公共积累和经营管理费外，净得十二元，而种一亩田一般前后要花十个劳动日，那么平均每个劳动日可得一元二角。而以当地作竹器的手工业工人来说，技术最好的每天可制四只畚箕，可卖一元八角，除成本、税收、公共积累等外，净得九角，并不比农民种粮食的劳动报酬高。第二笔账，手工业品的原料如竹、木等都是先向农民买的，不能光看手工业品价钱高就叫多花钱。第三笔账是手工业品销路有淡季、旺季之差，不能一年三百六十五天都生产，而农业社发展多种经济后，天天有工做，有劳动报酬可得。至于粮价和鱼价对比问题，贫农纪定续起来说：“解放前黄瓜鱼价钱也有高有低，高时二十斤谷子才能换一斤，低时三斤谷子就可换一斤。可是那时贫苦农民连饭都没得吃，那有福分去吃鱼，现在粮价、鱼价都稳定，一百斤谷子可换三十斤黄花鱼，对农民、渔民都有利。”
    富裕中农谢修池却说：“粮价要起要落应该掌在农民手里，农民的生活才会改善得快。”这个说法又引起一场争论，下中农方登钗算笔大账说：“我们那个生产队去年卖给国家二十五担谷子和三十六担番薯米，共得三百三十五元，如果起落价大权掌在我们手里，就说抬高它20％吧，那么可以多卖六十七元，但是以后缺粮又买回二十担谷子和十三担大米，共计付出二百七十一元。如果这些粮价起落大权掌在私商手里，也以抬价20％来算，那么我们就得多付出五十四元二角；其次，去年我们全队十六户社员共计新制了十件棉衣、二件羊毛衣、三十件单衣、二件棉被，还买了一些胶鞋、呢帽，共计付出三百一十四元，如果这些货价的起落大权掌在资本家手里，也以起它20％来说吧，那么我们就得多付出六十二元八角。就这三笔卖出和买入的账对除外，我们全队得多花五十元。你们看，粮食起落价的大权由农民自己掌握，农民能不能改善生活？”这个账一算后，大家都说：“粮价一动，百物都涨。结果还是农民吃亏。”原来思想不通的富裕中农、生产队长蔡阿暖在几笔大账的对比教育后当场表示说：“我们回去算算，即使有一斤余粮也要卖给国家。”结果这个队除卖了社里分配的六千多斤余粮外，又把多余的三千八百斤粮食交给社里统一处理。原为逃避粮食统购而退社的富裕中农陈必锦、周三伊被邀参加了这场大辩论后，提高了认识，看清了今后的粮食局势，也表示要重新申请入社。
