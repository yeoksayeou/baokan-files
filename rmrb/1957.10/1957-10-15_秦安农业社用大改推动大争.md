Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 13th: More than 400 agricultural cooperatives in Qin'an County, Gansu Province, are actively improving their work during the Great Blooming and Great Contending, promoting the Great Debate.

　　Each agricultural cooperative categorized and prioritized the opinions put forward by the members. Any problems that were correct and urgently needed to be resolved by the masses were immediately dealt with seriously. More than 4,000 opinions raised by more than 30 agricultural cooperatives in the Lianhua District have been half resolved. After studying the criticisms made by Jin Cheng Agricultural Cooperative members on the work style of eighteen team cadres, the cooperative committee made explanations on each item. Yangping Cooperative cleared up and publicized the chaotic accounts of the accountant, made up for the work points of nine members who were under-recorded, and corrected the 150 dan of manure incorrectly recorded for four households.

　　Each agricultural cooperative paid attention to accepting the opinions put forward by the masses, causing those who were initially skeptical and waited to express their true feelings and actively participate in the Great Debate. Members of Yuezi Cooperative who were originally unwilling to participate in the debate are now participating. At present, more than 82% of the agricultural cooperatives in the county have shifted from the Blooming and Contending stage to the Great Debate.

　　秦安农业社用大改推动大争
    据新华社兰州13日电　甘肃秦安县四百多个农业社在大鸣大放中积极改进工作，推动了大辩论。
    各个农业社把社员们提出的意见分类排队，凡属正确的而又为群众迫切需要解决的问题，立即作了严肃处理。莲花区三十多个农业社提出的四千多条意见，已经解决了一半。金城农业社社员对十八个队干部工作作风的批评，社委会研究后，件件做了交代。杨坪社把会计的混乱账目，清理公布，将少记的九个社员的工分补上，错记的四户一百五十石粪土改正了。
    各个农业社注意接受群众提出的意见，使起初怀疑观望的人谈出了真心话，积极参加了大辩论。跃紫社原不愿参加辩论的社员现在都参加了。目前全县有82％以上的农业社已由鸣放阶段转入大辩论。
