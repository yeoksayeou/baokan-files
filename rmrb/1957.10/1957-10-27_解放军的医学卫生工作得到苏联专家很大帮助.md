Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The health work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has received assistance in various aspects from Soviet experts.

The Soviet government accepted a group of PLA health cadres to study at their military medical institutions early on, and also sent many military medical experts to the PLA's health departments, military medical research institutions, and military medical universities to assist in work and train cadres. In the past few years, hundreds of senior and intermediate health workers in the PLA have graduated from professional training courses under the personal guidance of Soviet experts. In the work of health and epidemic prevention in the troops, thanks to the establishment of specialized health and epidemic prevention inspection institutions based on the experience of the Soviet army, as well as practical health supervision and strict health management systems, several major infectious diseases that were prevalent in the troops a few years ago have been completely eradicated or significantly reduced in incidence by 1956. The hospital construction work of the troops, after learning a series of advanced experiences from Soviet military hospitals, improved the average cure (including improvement) rate of each hospital by 35% and reduced the mortality rate by 50% in 1956 compared to 1953. All sanatoriums in the army have also achieved significant therapeutic effects due to the adoption of advanced management methods from Soviet army sanatoriums and the full utilization of natural factors and physical therapy.

    解放军的医学卫生工作得到苏联专家很大帮助
    据新华社讯　中国人民解放军的卫生工作，得到苏联专家的各方面帮助。
    苏联政府很早就接受了一批人民解放军的卫生干部到他们的军事医学机构学习，并且还派来许多军事医学专家到解放军的卫生部门、军事医学研究机构和军医大学里帮助工作和训练干部。几年来，解放军中已有几百名高级和中级卫生工作干部，在苏联专家亲自教导下，从专业训练班毕业。在部队卫生防疫工作中，由于根据苏军的经验，建立了专门的卫生防疫检验机构及切合实际的卫生监督和严格的卫生管理制度，已使几年前曾在部队中流行过的几种主要传染病，到1956年有的已经完全消灭，有的已经显著降低了发病率。部队的医院建设工作，在学习了苏联军队医院的一系列先进经验后，1956年比1953年平均各个医院的治愈（包括改善）率提高了35％，死亡率降低了50％。全军各个疗养院，也由于采用了苏联军队疗养院的先进管理方法，充分利用了自然因素、理学疗法，取得了显著的疗效。
