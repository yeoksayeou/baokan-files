    Production Internship Class
    Dai Yue
    As you enter the gate of Beijing No. 14 Middle School, you can hear the whirring of machines. Small factory buildings, converted from dormitories and classrooms, are filled with various machines. This is the production internship factory of No. 14 Middle School.
    The carpentry and fitter workshops are equipped with workbenches and simple tools; in the electrician's room, there are radios with three to seven tubes, as well as instruments repaired for other schools, all made by the students during their production internship class time.
    Now, all classes have added production internship classes—carpentry, metalwork, and electrical work for junior high schools, and machining, fitting, automotive, and electrical work for senior high schools. The school has made this course a required subject. Students are very fond of the production internship classes. According to the teachers, in the year or so since the course began, students have not been late, absent, or undisciplined. Through the internship, students have gained a deep understanding of physical labor. The students said: We must respect the workers, learn from the workers, and train ourselves to become true intellectuals of the working class.

    生产实习课
    戴月
    一走进北京市第十四中学的大门，就听到机器的旋转声。一座座用宿舍和教室改建成的小厂房，里边安装着各种各样的机器。这就是十四中的生产实习工厂。
    木工和钳工的工作室里设有工作台，台上放着一些简单的工具；在电工室里有三个灯到七个灯的收音机，还有给外校修理好了的仪器，这是学生们在生产实习课的时间里作出来的。
    现在，各班都增设了生产实习课——初中的木工、金工、电工，高中的机工、钳工、汽车、电工，学校已经把这门课作为必修课。学生们非常喜爱生产实习课，据教师说开课一年多学生没有迟到、旷课、不守纪律等现象。经过实习学生对体力劳动有了深刻的体会，学生们说：要尊重工人，向工人学习，把自己锻炼成为真正的工人阶级的知识分子。
