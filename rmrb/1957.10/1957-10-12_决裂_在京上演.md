　　“The Breakup” Performed in Beijing
　　One of the classic works of Soviet theater that sings the praises of the Soviet October Revolution, the famous drama "The Breakup" (by the Soviet Lavrenyov), has been performed in the capital by the faculty training class of the Shanghai Theatre Academy, under the careful direction of Soviet drama expert Lepkovskaya.
　　This drama, with the great historical event of the uprising of the cruiser "Aurora" and the bombing of the Winter Palace as its theme, profoundly expresses the complexity of the struggle of the October Revolution. Using the captain's family as a typical example, it depicts the different characters in the revolutionary torrent; the captain and his daughter each turned to the revolution from different experiences, while the son-in-law of aristocratic origin turned to counter-revolution. It tells us that those who choose the path of revolution cannot but "break up" with those who turn to counter-revolution. (Miao Bo) (Attached picture)

　　“决裂”在京上演
    歌颂苏联十月革命、苏维埃戏剧经典作品之一、著名话剧“决裂”（苏联拉夫列涅夫作剧），经苏联戏剧专家列普柯芙斯卡娅的精心排练，已由上海戏剧学院师资进修班在首都演出了。
    这出话剧以“曙光号”巡洋舰起义、炮轰冬宫这一伟大历史事件为题材，深刻地表现了十月革命的斗争的复杂性。它以舰长一家作为典型，描绘了革命激流中的不同人物；舰长和他女儿各自从不同的经历走向了革命，贵族出身的女婿却走向了反革命。它告诉我们：选择了革命道路的人不可能不和走向反革命的人“决裂”。　（苗波）（附图片）
