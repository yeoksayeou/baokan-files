Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th: China's first natural petroleum base, the Yumen Oil Mine, has been basically completed. It has now become a large-scale petroleum complex with departments for geological exploration, drilling, oil extraction, refining, machinery repair and fitting, oilfield construction, and petroleum scientific research.

The Yumen Oil Mine was discovered in 1936. Large-scale construction and exploitation only began after liberation. In the past eight years, the number of new oil wells drilled by this oil mine is equivalent to ten times the total number of oil wells drilled in the ten years before liberation. Dozens of oil separation stations have also been newly built and expanded in the oil extraction area, and a number of water injection plants and a large gas injection plant have been newly built, using the world's advanced methods of oilfield edge water injection and top gas injection for oilfield development. As a result, the annual crude oil production has increased rapidly, and it is estimated that the crude oil produced this year will be ten times more than in 1949. After liberation, due to the commissioning of the newly built large-scale electric desalting plant, the quality of crude oil from the Yumen Oil Mine has also greatly improved compared to before liberation.

The equipment of the Yumen Oil Mine refinery was very rudimentary before liberation. At that time, the annual petroleum processing volume was very small, and by the eve of liberation, it could only produce seven kinds of products. After the construction since liberation, the petroleum processing volume of the Yumen Oil Mine refinery this year has increased by more than four times compared to 1949, and the number of successfully trial-produced petroleum products has increased to thirty-two.

In the process of building the Yumen Oil Mine into a petroleum base, a large number of talents for petroleum industrial construction have also been cultivated. Up to now, the Yumen Oil Mine has successively transferred more than 6,000 technicians and cadres to petroleum exploration and refining departments in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Sichuan, Hebei, Shanghai, Lanzhou, and other places. In recent years, fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, Romania, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Poland have sent a large number of excellent experts to help the construction of the Yumen Oil Mine and have supplied the oil mine with a large number of brand-new exploration instruments, various equipment, large drilling rigs, and materials.

    我国第一个天然石油基地
    玉门油矿建成大型石油联合企业
    据新华社兰州8日电　我国第一个天然石油基地——玉门油矿已经基本建成。现在，它已经成为一座拥有地质勘探、钻井、采油、炼油、机械修配、油田建设和石油科学研究等部门的大型石油联合企业。
    玉门油矿是1936年发现的。大规模的建设和开采，解放以后才开始。八年来，这个油矿钻凿的新油井，相当于解放以前十年中钻凿油井总和的十倍。在采油区还新建、扩建了几十座选油站，新建了一批注水厂和一座大型注气厂，采用了世界上先进的油田边缘注水、顶部注气的开采油田的方法。因此，原油年产量迅速增长，今年预计生产的原油将比1949年增加十倍。解放以后，由于新建的大型电力脱盐厂的投入生产，玉门油矿的原油质量也比解放以前大大提高。
    玉门油矿炼油厂解放以前的设备非常简陋。那时每年的石油加工处理量很小，到解放前夕，它只能生产七种产品。经过解放以后的建设，今年玉门油矿炼油厂的石油加工处理量已经比1949年增加了四倍多，试制成功的石油产品已经增加到三十二种。
    玉门油矿在建设成为石油基地的过程中，还培养出了大批的石油工业建设人材。到目前为止，玉门油矿已经先后向新疆、青海、四川、河北、上海、兰州等地的石油勘探和炼油部门，输送了六千多名技术工人和干部。几年来，苏联、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰等兄弟国家，曾派来大批优秀专家，帮助玉门油矿建设，并且供应了油矿大量崭新的勘探仪器、各种设备、大型钻机和器材。
