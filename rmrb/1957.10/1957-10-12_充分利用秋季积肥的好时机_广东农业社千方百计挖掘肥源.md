Make Full Use of the Good Opportunity for Autumn Fertilizer Accumulation
Agricultural Cooperatives in Guangdong are Trying Every Means to Explore Fertilizer Sources
(Our dispatch) Agricultural production cooperatives in Guangdong are making every effort to accumulate fertilizer and overcome the difficulty of fertilizer shortage.

First, agricultural cooperatives in various places encourage members to actively accumulate household fertilizer through reasonable pricing and purchasing methods. According to statistics from the past ten days or so, more than 8,500 cooperatives across the province have purchased more than 3.1 billion catties of household fertilizer, and members are generally satisfied with the reasonable purchase prices.

The household fertilizer self-accumulated by members in various places is very rich, mostly high-quality human and animal manure and miscellaneous soil fertilizer. However, in the previous period, some agricultural cooperatives set the purchase prices too low, which led to many members taking a negative attitude towards fertilizer accumulation. Some wasted a lot of fertilizer in their private plots, while agricultural cooperatives felt that fertilizer was insufficient. Recently, in response to this phenomenon, and in line with the spirit of simultaneous rectification and improvement, various places have revised the previously low prices according to quality and quantity, and have tried to pay in cash as much as possible, so as to take both public and private interests into account. After doing so, the members are happy to sell their fertilizer to the agricultural cooperatives. Some cooperatives in the Gaoyao and Zhanjiang Special Districts have organized household fertilizer purchasing groups in production teams, specifically responsible for investigating the amount of fertilizer stored by each household, and purchasing a large amount of scattered fertilizer.

Currently, in order to obtain fertilizer for winter planting and spring plowing, a fall fertilizer accumulation campaign is being carried out in various places. Every day, hundreds of thousands of people across the province go to the mountains to collect wild grass and tender leaves, and go to the sea to collect sea snails, seaweed, and sea mud. Some even travel dozens of miles to find nitre soil and other fertilizers. The province is also preparing to expand the planting of green manure crops by three million mu this winter, and many agricultural cooperatives are also making their own granular fertilizer.

　　充分利用秋季积肥的好时机
    广东农业社千方百计挖掘肥源
    本报讯　广东省各地农业生产合作社正在千方百计地努力积肥，克服肥料不足的困难。
    首先，各地农业社通过合理作价收购的办法，鼓励社员积极积存家庭肥料。据最近十多天的统计，全省已有八千五百多个社收购到家庭肥料三十一亿多斤，社员对合理的收购价格一般表示满意。
    各地社员的自积的家庭肥料是很丰富的，大多数是质量很好的人畜粪尿和土杂肥。但前一个时期，部分地区的农业社对收购价格定得过低，以致许多社员对积肥采取消极态度，有的把大量的肥料浪费在自留地里，而农业社却感到肥料不足。最近，针对这种现象，各地就根据边鸣放、边改进的精神，按质按量修正了过去偏低的价格，并尽量以现金支付，做到公私兼顾。这样做了以后，社员们都乐于把肥料卖给农业社。高要、湛江专区有些社在生产队里组织家庭肥料收购小组，专门负责调查各农户的存肥数量，把散存的肥料大量收购上来。
    目前，为了取得冬种和春耕的肥料，各地正在开展一个秋季积肥运动。全省每天都有几十万人上山采集野草嫩叶，出海捞取海蚬、海藻、海坭，有的还跋踄几十里路去找寻坭炭土等肥料。全省还准备今冬扩种绿肥作物三百万亩，许多农业社中还自制颗粒肥料。
