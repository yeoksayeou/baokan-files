Russian folk songs have no God, need no Tsar, we will always coexist with the Soviets. We have Comrade Lenin, he leads the way, we follow closely. Little hammer, ding ding dong, awl, very helpful. Working tirelessly late into the night, making boots for heroes to wear. Where have the wild geese flown? They have gone to drink lake water. Where has my beloved gone? He has gone to the battlefield to fight the White bandits. My beloved has written a letter, he is fighting the White bandits with great energy, he wants to win a Red Medal, to wear on his chest when he returns home.

    俄罗斯民谣没有上帝，不需要沙皇，我们永远和苏维埃共存亡。我们有列宁同志，他在前面走，我们紧跟上。小铁锤，叮叮当，锥子儿，多帮忙。三更半夜手不停，做好靴子英雄穿。大雁飞到哪里去了？喝饮湖水去了。亲爱的人儿哪里去了？上战场打白匪去了。亲爱的人儿写来一封信，他和白匪打得很有劲，他要争取一枚红色勋章，回家时佩在胸脯上。
