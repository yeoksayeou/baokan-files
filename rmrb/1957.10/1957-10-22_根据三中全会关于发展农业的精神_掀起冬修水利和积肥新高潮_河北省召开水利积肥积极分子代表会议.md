    Baoding, this paper, 21st -- The Hebei Province Representative Meeting of Activists in Water Conservancy and Fertilizer Accumulation, held from October 14th to 20th, determined that a mass-based, large-scale upsurge of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation will be launched this winter and next spring in order to strive for 22 billion jin of grain and 700 million jin of cotton production in 1958.

    This meeting was convened in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo, Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan, and Vice Minister of Water Conservancy Li Baohua came from Beijing to participate and all made important instructions at the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of the province. In his speech, he called on everyone to conscientiously implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session on developing agriculture and actively study the two key measures of water conservancy construction and increasing fertilizer application. This meeting determined that the province should strive to expand the irrigated area by 8 million to 10 million mu next year, control soil and water conservation in mountainous areas covering 6,000 square kilometers, build more than 1,000 small reservoirs, and complete flood prevention projects such as ditches, canals, and ridge fields on 20 million mu in the plains; strive to apply an average of more than 5,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and those with suitable conditions should reach more than 7,000 or 8,000 jin. The meeting believes that there are favorable conditions for carrying out this movement: the socialist great debate is being carried out in depth in rural areas, which will greatly enhance the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants; Hebei Province achieved a bumper harvest this year, which has provided an economic foundation for carrying out water conservancy construction; the broad masses have an urgent demand to eliminate water disasters, develop water conservancy, and increase fertilizer application; at the same time, different regions have accumulated considerable experience in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. The meeting requested the representatives to fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, adhere to the principle of diligence and thrift in running water conservancy projects, and actively promote and carry out this movement.

    The meeting was attended by 658 activists in water conservancy construction and 143 activists in fertilizer accumulation. These representatives from various types of advanced agricultural production cooperatives discussed with full confidence and accepted the glorious task of a great leap forward in agricultural production proposed by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee, and fully exchanged their advanced deeds of a great leap forward in production and their experience in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation in impoverished mountainous areas, low-lying areas, saline-alkali wasteland, and plain areas.

    During the meeting, Yan Dakai, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor, and Ma Guorui, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made reports and speeches respectively. They called on the representatives to play a leading role in the water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation movement in order to drive the masses to realize a great leap forward in agricultural production.

    This meeting was carefully prepared. In September, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee organized leading cadres from various special districts and counties to visit typical examples of well irrigation, mechanical irrigation, soil and water conservation, and low-lying area transformation in places such as Xingtai, Zhangjiakou, and Tianjin. The Provincial Water Conservancy Department convened an experience exchange meeting on soil and water conservation in Huaian County, which has good soil and water conservation. A training class for building small reservoirs was held in Xingtai County, which has done a good job in building small reservoirs. At the same time as the meeting was held, preparations for water conservancy construction in various places were also accelerating. Water conservancy construction committees and offices have been established in various special districts and counties. Some townships have established water conservancy construction headquarters. Many agricultural cooperatives have also added water conservancy shares to specifically lead water conservancy construction.

    The meeting also issued 51 prize banners and 183 certificates of merit to model units. (Picture attached)

    根据三中全会关于发展农业的精神
    掀起冬修水利和积肥新高潮
    河北省召开水利积肥积极分子代表会议
    本报保定21日电　10月14日到20日召开的河北省水利、积肥积极分子代表会议确定，要在今冬明春掀起一个群众性的大规模的水利建设和积肥高潮，争取1958年生产粮食二百二十亿斤、棉花七亿斤。
    这次会议是根据中共三中全会的精神召开的。国务院副总理薄一波、农业部部长廖鲁言和水利部副部长李葆华从北京赶来参加，并都在会上作了重要指示。会议由中共河北省委第一书记、省长林铁主持，他在会上号召大家认真贯彻执行三中全会关于发展农业的精神，积极研究兴修水利、增施肥料两项关键性的措施。这次会议确定，争取明年全省扩大灌溉面积八百万到一千万亩，在山区水土保持控制流域面积六千平方公里，修小型水库一千座以上，平原完成沟洫畦田等防涝工程两千万亩；争取平均每亩施肥达到五千斤以上，有条件的要达到七、八千斤以上。会议认为开展这一运动是有有利条件的，农村正在深入进行社会主义大辩论，将会大大提高广大农民的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性；今年河北省获得丰收，有了开展水利建设的经济基础；广大群众具有除水害兴水利和增施肥料的迫切要求；同时不同地区都积累了相当丰富的兴修水利和积肥的经验。会议要求代表们充分发动群众、依靠群众，坚持勤俭办水利事业的原则，积极推动和开展这一运动。
    参加这次会议的有六百五十八名水利建设积极分子和一百四十三名积肥积极分子。这些来自各种类型的先进农业生产合作社的代表，满怀信心地讨论并接受了中共河北省委和省人民委员会提出的农业生产大跃进的光荣任务，并在会上充分交流了他们在贫瘠山区、低洼地区、盐碱荒地和平原地区所创造的生产大跃进的先进事迹和水利建设、积肥的经验。
    会议期间，中共河北省委书记、副省长阎达开，中共河北省委书记马国瑞，分别作了报告和讲了话。他们号召代表在水利建设、积肥运动中起带头作用，以便带动群众实现农业生产的大跃进。
    这次会议是经过充分准备的。9月间中共河北省委和河北省人民委员会即组织了各专区、县党政领导干部，分赴行唐、张家口、天津等地参观井灌、机械灌溉、水土保持、洼地改造等典型。省水利厅在水土保持较好的怀安县，召开了水土保持经验交流会。在兴修小水库较好的行唐县，举办了兴修小型水库训练班。在会议举行的同时，各地水利建设的准备工作也在加速进行。各专区、县先后建立了水利建设委员会和办公室。有些乡成立了水利建设指挥部。不少农业社也增设了水利股，专门领导水利建设。
    会议还发了五十一面奖旗和一百八十三个奖状给模范单位。（附图片）
