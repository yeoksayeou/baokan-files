Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 19th: The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a directive on the 18th to party committees at all levels and party organizations directly under the province to further implement the principle of rectifying while correcting.

The Provincial Committee pointed out that since the launch of the anti-Rightist struggle, the leaders of some units have not sufficiently understood the importance of rectifying while correcting. Some have relaxed this work, while others have not corrected quickly, ruthlessly, or thoroughly enough. According to incomplete statistics from the directly subordinate organs of the province, Nanchang City, and the directly subordinate organs of Ganzhou, Jiujiang, Nanchang, and Fuzhou, only 19.8% of the opinions put forward by the masses have been resolved. Therefore, the Provincial Committee decided to fully mobilize the masses throughout the province, vigorously creating a surge of improving work style and improving work. The Provincial Committee requires party committees at all levels to promptly handle the opinions put forward by the masses, ensuring that every item is accounted for and every matter is resolved. All units should establish rectification and correction teams with responsible persons presiding over them and with the participation of the masses, responsible for collecting and studying the opinions of the masses. The method of correction should combine leadership with the masses, following the mass line; the content of the correction should generally focus on overcoming sectarianism and the tendency of cadres to seek privileges, as well as relatively major issues such as streamlining institutions.

In order to promote the work of rectifying while correcting, the relevant departments of the Provincial Committee have put forward improvement plans on six issues: housing, wages and welfare, leading cadres participating in physical labor, mobilizing cadres' family members to return to their hometowns, cadre issues, and the use of cars and bicycles, for reference by all units when improving their work.

　　江西省委指示各级党委加强整改工作
    新华社南昌19日电  中共江西省委18日指示各级党委和省直属机关党组织进一步贯彻边整边改的方针。
    省委指出，自开展反右派斗争以来，有些单位的领导人由于对边整边改的重要意义认识不足，有的放松了这一工作，有的改得不快、不狠、不彻底。据省直属机关和南昌市及赣南、九江、南昌、抚州等直属机关的不完全统计，群众提出的意见中已经解决的，只占全部意见的19.8％。因此，省委决定在全省范围内充分发动群众，大张旗鼓地造成一个改进作风、改进工作的热潮。省委要求各级党委迅速处理群众所提出来的意见，做到条条有交代，件件有着落。各单位都应成立有负责人主持和有群众参加的整改小组，负责搜集和研究群众的意见。改的方法，采取领导与群众相结合，走群众路线；改的内容，一般着重于克服宗派主义和干部的特殊化倾向，以及紧缩机构等比较重大的问题。
    为了推动边整边改工作，省委各有关部门已就房屋、工资福利、领导干部参加体力劳动、动员干部家属返乡、干部问题以及汽车自行车使用等六个问题，提出了改进方案，供各单位改进工作时参考。
