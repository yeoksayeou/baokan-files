According to a report in the Liaoning Daily: Factory No. 53 began to transition from general airing of views to thematic airing of views in late September, bringing the great airing of views and great debate to a new climax.

Since the factory launched the masses of workers in a great airing of views and great debate on September 17, by September 24, the general problems had been aired out pretty much. Sometimes the airing of views meetings would get stuck. Some people would say at the beginning of the meeting: "I have nothing to say today. The big-character posters have been written, and the opinions have been offered. Please let other comrades speak." Some asked the leadership to point out a direction. After analysis and research by the Party committee, it was believed that although general problems had been aired out, many problems had been raised, but major problems had not been aired out enough. The scope of the problems aired out was not wide enough, especially problems related to the country's political and economic life, the Party's guidelines and policies, and the fundamental system of the enterprise, which had not been aired out deeply enough. Therefore, it was decided to shift to thematic airing of views, and seven themes were proposed: wage and reward policies, cadre policies and personnel use, production management and labor protection, labor emulation drives and rationalization proposals, Party-masses relations, and national political and economic life. The masses of workers were further mobilized for a great airing of views and great debate. At the beginning of the thematic airing of views, each unit conducted research and first aired out the themes that the masses of workers were most concerned about. After everyone had aired out their views on this issue, they would move on to another theme.

After the thematic airing of views began, the things and people involved were more specific and more practical than during the general airing of views. As a result, all kinds of ideological problems reappeared. For example, the thematic airing of views on production management involved more opinions on specific management personnel, and some workshop directors or foremen felt unable to remain calm; when Party-masses relations were aired out, opinions were concentrated, and some Party and mass cadres also felt unable to bear it. Among the masses of workers, because the thematic airing of views involved more direct criticism of cadres, there were also concerns. The Party organization provided timely individual assistance and specialized education, and the concerns were dispelled.

Through the above-mentioned work, after transitioning from general airing of views to thematic airing of views, a new climax of airing of views was immediately launched. After more than a week, the number of speakers reached more than 90%, the number of big-character posters increased to more than 5,870, and the number of opinions reached 15,426. In particular, the quality of the airing of views by the masses of workers has been significantly improved, major problems have increased, and excessive demands have decreased. Before the thematic airing of views, there were only more than 800 opinions on production management, but now there are more than 4,000. In the past, there were only more than 40 opinions on national political and economic life, but now there are more than 500. Many opinions not only have criticisms and suggestions, but also have active and correct solutions. After organizing the thematic airing of views, the masses of workers all reflected that this method is good, saying that this way the problems are concentrated, the goals are clear, it can guide us to speak in depth, and it can really solve problems.

### 五三工厂转入专题鸣放  运动出现新的高潮

　　五三工厂转入专题鸣放
    运动出现新的高潮
    据辽宁日报报道：五三工厂从9月下旬开始由一般鸣放转入专题鸣放，使大鸣大放又出现了新高潮。
    这个厂从9月17日开始发动职工群众大鸣大放以来，到9月24日为止的八天中，一般性问题放的差不多了，鸣放会上有时候就卡住了。有的人在鸣放会一开始就表示说：“今天我没有什么提的了，大字报也写了，意见也提了，请别的同志发言吧。”有的要求领导再给指个方向。经党委分析研究，认为一般性的问题虽然都鸣放出来了，问题提了很多，但重大问题鸣放的不够多。鸣放的问题范围也不够广，特别是有关国家政治、经济生活、党的方针政策和企业根本制度等方面的问题鸣放的还不深透。于是，确定转向专题鸣放，提出了工资奖励政策、干部政策与人员使用、生产管理与劳动保护、劳动竞赛与合理化建议、党群关系、国家政治生活和经济生活等七个专题，进一步发动职工群众大鸣大放。在专题鸣放开始的时候，各个单位都经过研究，先鸣放职工群众最关心的专题，等大家对这个问题鸣放完了，再转入另一个专题上去。
    开始专题鸣放后，比一般鸣放时涉及的事情和人更具体了，更实际了，这样，各种各样的思想问题又出现了。比如专题鸣放生产管理，涉及到对具体管理人员的意见就多了，有的车间主任或工长就感到沉不住气了；放到党群关系时，意见集中，也有些党群干部感到受不了。在职工群众中，因为专题鸣放时直接批评干部的事情更多了，也有顾虑，党组织都及时地进行了个别帮助和专门教育，顾虑解除。
    通过上述各种工作，从一般鸣放转入专题鸣放之后，立刻就掀起了新的鸣放高潮，经过一周多的时间，发言人数即达到90％以上，大字报增加到五千八百七十多张，意见达到一万五千四百二十六条。特别是职工群众鸣放的质量有了显著提高，重大问题增多了，过高的要求减少了。生产管理意见在专题鸣放之前只有八百多条，现在已达到四千多条，国家政治、经济生活方面的意见，过去只有四十多条，现在已达到五百多条。许多意见，不仅有批评，有建议，还有积极正确的解决办法。组织专题鸣放后，职工群众都反映这种办法好，说这样问题集中，目标明确，能引导我们深入发言，也真能解决问题。
