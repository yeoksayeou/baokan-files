The traditional friendship between China and Afghanistan
        Xie Xiaoping

Afghanistan is a neighbor of China in the west. Although China and Afghanistan share less than one hundred kilometers of border, the peoples of the two countries began friendly exchanges as early as two thousand years ago.

The Da Yuezhi recorded in Chinese historical books is today's Afghanistan. The Da Yuezhi people originally lived between Dunhuang and Qilian in China. Around the 3rd century BC, they were oppressed by the Xiongnu and moved to the Guishui River Basin in Central Asia—present-day Afghanistan and Uzbekistan in the Soviet Union—and established the Da Yuezhi Kingdom. In the 1st century BC, this ethnic group also established the Kushan Dynasty, which included northwestern India. In the 18th century, Afghanistan established a unified kingdom. Chinese historical books began to refer to it as "Aiwuhan."

Before sea routes were opened, ancient Chinese merchants transported silk to the West via Afghanistan. The famous "Silk Road" in the history of Sino-Western communication refers to this. The first to open this road to the West was Zhang Qian, a famous Chinese traveler of the 2nd century BC, who visited various countries in the Western Regions twice. Between 139 BC and 122 BC, he passed through Shule, Dawan, and Kangju before reaching Da Yuezhi. Zhang Qian's two westward journeys enriched the then Chinese knowledge of the geography of various Western countries. After that, travelers from China, Da Yuezhi, and Western countries successively explored more transportation routes. The most important of these, the north and south lines, both had Afghanistan as a central hub.

The relationship between China and Afghanistan in Buddhist culture was established very early. About half a century before Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty sent Cai Yin to India to seek Buddhist teachings, Da Yuezhi had already had Buddhist exchanges with China. In the first year of Yuanshou of Emperor Ai of the Han Dynasty (2 BC), King Da Yuezhi sent an envoy, Yicun, to China to promote Buddhism. The "Forty-Two Sutras," the earliest Buddhist scriptures introduced into China, were also introduced via Da Yuezhi. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, some famous monks from the Western Regions in China, such as Zhi Yao, Zhi Loujiachan, Fa Hu, and Zhi Jiangliangjie, were all Yuezhi people. Later, some of them became naturalized Chinese citizens. In the 4th century, the monk Tannan from Touqiele and the monk Futuobamo from Tokhara, who arrived in Liangzhou, China in the 5th century, translated a large number of Buddhist scriptures in China, enriching the treasure of Chinese Buddhist culture.

Afghanistan became a hub for promoting Buddhist culture not only because of geographical reasons, but more importantly, because Buddhist culture flourished in Afghanistan itself between the 1st and 5th centuries AD. Xiao Wangshe City, which occupies an important position in the spread of Buddhism, is today's Balkh City in Afghanistan. Therefore, many Chinese monks who went to India mostly took the route through Afghanistan in order to pay homage to Buddhist relics. Between the 4th and 5th centuries AD, the Chinese monks Faxian, Zhimeng, and Fayong, and in the 6th century, Huisheng, Song Yun, and others, recorded Afghan Buddhist sites in their writings. In the 7th century, the famous Chinese monk Xuanzang traveled to India and passed through Afghanistan twice.

Afghanistan not only established close relations with China in the spread of Buddhism, but also had profound friendship between the two countries in other religious activities. According to records, in 719 AD, the seventh year of Kaiyuan in the Tang Dynasty, the Tokhara people came to China to spread Manichaeism and Christianity. In 781 AD, the second year of Jianzhong in the reign of Emperor Dezong of the Tang Dynasty, Keumdan, the son of the monk Milisi of Barihei City, the former Tokhara Kingdom, and Archbishop Ye Sibuxide, visited China and established the "Great Qin Jingjiao Popular China Stele" in Chang'an. Similarly, Afghanistan's contribution to the spread of Islam is also recorded in the history of the development of Islam in China.

The political exchanges between Afghanistan and China also started very early. According to the records of the ancient Chinese classic "Shi Yi Ji," in 104 BC, the second year of Taichu of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Da Yuezhi sent an envoy to visit China. From 605 to 616 AD, Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty also sent imperial historian Wei Jie and Sili official Du Xingman as envoys to the Western Regions, visiting Wangshe City in Afghanistan. In the early Tang Dynasty, exchanges between Afghanistan and China became more frequent, and it can be said that it reached its peak under the conditions of inconvenient ancient transportation. According to incomplete statistics, during the forty-odd years of Kaiyuan Tianbao (713-755 AD), the countries of Tokhara, Xieyi, Humi, Yida, Jieshuai, and Gutu in Afghanistan sent envoys to visit China as many as 35 times. During the Tang Dynasty, China also sent envoys to visit various countries in Afghanistan many times. In 658 AD, Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty sent an envoy to visit Tokhara. The "Thirty Volumes of Western Regions Illustrated Records" written by Xu Jingzong after the envoy returned to China is one of the earliest Chinese classics recording the geography of various countries in Afghanistan. In the 11th and 12th centuries, there were fewer records of exchanges between China and Afghanistan. However, in the books such as Zhou Qufei's "Lingwai Daida" and Zhao Rugua's "Zhu Fan Zhi," the situation of the Jizni Kingdom in Afghanistan was also introduced among the countries of Dashi. By the 15th century, Badakhshan in Afghanistan began to resume exchanges with China. It can be seen that the profound friendship and close relationship between China and Afghanistan are truly "historical records without interruption."

There are also interesting historical records of exchanges between Afghanistan and China in terms of plant and animal varieties and production techniques. In the 2nd century BC, when Zhang Qian visited the Western Regions and returned to China, he brought back many plant varieties that had never been seen in China before, such as safflower, sesame, broad beans, garlic, alfalfa, cucumber, pomegranate, walnut, grape, and carrot, some of which originally grew in Afghanistan. From 424 to 428 AD, during the reign of Emperor Taiwu of the Wei Dynasty, Da Yuezhi merchants came to the capital of China to cast colored glaze. It is said that due to the introduction of Da Yuezhi's technology of producing colored glaze, the production cost was reduced, and the price of colored glaze on the market was greatly depreciated. As for the improved breeds of horses and donkeys introduced to China from Afghanistan, they were very helpful in improving agricultural production and facilitating transportation in ancient China.

In the past century, both China and Afghanistan have suffered from the aggression of Western imperialists. In 1840, Britain launched an armed attack on China, and the Opium War broke out; in the same year, Afghanistan was at the height of the first Anglo-Afghan War. The two countries stood on the same front from the very beginning in the struggle against imperialism. Therefore, it is completely understandable that the peoples of the two countries, who have stood up after shaking off the shackles of imperialism, can today form a close good-neighborly relationship. It is firmly believed that the friendship between China and Afghanistan, based on friendly traditions, will surely last as long as the mountains and rivers, and last forever! (Attached pictures)

    中国和阿富汗的传统友谊
    谢孝苹
    阿富汗是中国西部的一个邻国。中国和阿富汗接壤虽不到一百公里，但是两国人民远在二千年前就开始了友好往来。
    记载在中国史籍上的大月氏，就是今天的阿富汗。大月氏民族本来居住在中国的敦煌、祁连间。约在公元前三世纪时，他们受到了匈奴族的压迫，才迁居到中亚细亚妫水流域——现今阿富汗和苏联乌兹别克地方，建立了大月氏王国。公元前一世纪时，这支民族又建立了包括印度西北地区在内的贵霜王朝。公元十八世纪时，阿富汗建立了统一的王国。中国史籍上才开始称之为“爱乌罕。”
    在海道未通以前，古代中国商人，经由阿富汗将丝绸运往西方。中西交通史上有名的“丝道”，就是指此。首先开辟这条通往西方道路的，是公元前二世纪时中国有名的旅行家张骞，张骞曾经两次访问西域诸国。他在公元前139年至前122年之间，经历疏敕，大宛、康居而抵达大月氏。张骞两次西行，丰富了当时中国对西方各国的地理知识。此后，经中国、大月氏和西方诸国旅行家们陆续探明了更多的交通线路。其中最主要的南北两线都是以阿富汗为中间枢纽的。
    中国和阿富汗在佛教文化上的关系建立很早。在汉明帝派遣蔡愔去印度寻访佛法以前约半个世纪，大月氏就和中国有了佛教上的往来。汉哀帝元寿元年（公元前二年），大月氏王曾派遣使臣伊存来到中国宣扬佛法。最初传入中国的佛教经典“四十二章经”，也是经由大月氏传入的。公元二、三世纪间，一些在中国有名的西域高僧，如支曜、支娄迦谶、法护、支畺梁接等人都是月支人。后来有些人归化了中国。公元四世纪兜佉勒来到中国的高僧昙摩难提和五世纪到达中国凉州的吐火罗高僧浮陀跋摩，都在中国翻译了大批佛教经典，丰富了中国佛教文化的宝藏。
    阿富汗所以成为宣扬佛教文化的枢纽，不仅仅是由于地理上的原因，而更为重要的因素，是因为在公元一世纪到五世纪之间，佛教文化在阿富汗本土就大为兴盛。在佛教传播上占很重要地位的小王舍城，就是现今阿富汗的巴尔克城。因此许多中国高僧，前往印度，大多取道阿富汗，以便瞻仰佛教遗迹。公元四、五世纪之间，前往印度求法的中国高僧法显、智猛、法勇，公元六世纪的惠生、宋云等人，在他们的著述中都记载了阿富汗的佛教名迹。公元七世纪时，中国有名的高僧玄奘前往印度，往返两次都经过阿富汗。
    阿富汗不仅在传播佛教上和中国建立了密切的关系，在其他宗教活动上，两国之间也同样存在着深厚的友谊。据记载，公元719年，即唐开元七年，吐火罗人来到中国传布摩尼教和基督教。公元781年，即唐德宗建中二年，故吐火罗国巴里黑城僧密理斯之子克姆丹王城大僧及总主教叶俟布锡德访问中国，在长安建立了“大秦景教流行中国碑”。同样，阿富汗传播伊斯兰教的功绩，也纪录在中国伊斯兰教发展的历史上。
    阿富汗和中国在政治上的交往，也开始得很早。根据中国古代典籍“拾遗记”的记载，纪元前104年，即汉武帝太初二年，大月氏就派遣了使者访问中国。公元605—616年，隋炀帝也派御史韦节、司隶从事杜行满出使西域诸国，访问了阿富汗的王舍城。到了唐代初叶，阿富汗诸国和中国的交往更加频繁，在古代交通不便的情况下，可说达到了高峰。据不完全统计，开元天宝四十余年之间（公元713至755年），阿富汗的吐火罗、谢?、胡密、悒怛、劫帅、骨咄等国派遣使臣访问中国竟达三十五次之多。在唐代，中国也曾多次派遣使臣访问阿富汗诸国。公元658年，唐高宗派遣使臣访问吐火罗。使臣归国后，由许敬宗所撰写的“西域图志三十卷”，是中国记载阿富汗诸国地理的最早典籍之一。公元十一、十二世纪，中阿两国交往的纪录较少。但在周去非“岭外代答”和赵汝适“诸蕃志”等书中，也都在大食国诸国中介绍了阿富汗的吉慈尼国的情况。到公元十五世纪时，阿富汗的巴达克珊又开始和中国恢复了交往。可见中国和阿富汗之间的深厚友谊和亲密关系，真是“史不绝书”的。
    在阿富汗和中国的动植物品种和生产技术的交流方面，史书也有着有趣的记载。公元前二世纪，张骞访问西域归国时，带回了许多中国前所未有的植物品种，如红蓝花、胡麻、蚕豆、大蒜、苜蓿、黄瓜、石榴、核桃、葡萄、胡萝卜等，其中有些原来就是生长在阿富汗的。公元424—428年，魏太武时，大月氏商人来到中国京师铸造琉璃。据说，由于传入了大月氏生产琉璃的技术，生产成本降低，琉璃在市场上的价格因而大贬。至于由阿富汗介绍到中国的良种马、驴，对古代中国农业生产的改进和交通运输的便利，都很有帮助。
    近百年来，中国和阿富汗都同样地受到了西方帝国主义者的侵略。1840年，英国开始向中国发动武装进攻，爆发了鸦片战争；而同年，阿富汗也正是处在第一次抗英战争的高潮中。两国在反对帝国主义的斗争中，一开始就站在同一条战线上。因此，在摆脱了帝国主义的束缚而站起来了的两国人民，今天能够结成亲密的睦邻关系，是完全可以理解的。深信中阿两国之间的友谊，在友好传统的基础上，必将山高水长，永古长存！（附图片）
