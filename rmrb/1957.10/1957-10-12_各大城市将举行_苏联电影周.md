　　"Soviet Film Week" to Be Held in Major Cities
    A large-scale "Soviet Film Week" will be held from November 7th in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and twenty-seven provinces and cities. The feature films to be screened include "Whirlwind of Hatred," "Defenders of the Fortress," "Vocation," "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "Prelude to Revolution," as well as the fairy tales "The Bewitched Boy," "The Ugly Duckling," and "The Magic Sack." Except for "Vocation" and "Defenders of the Fortress," all are color films. "Prelude to Revolution" is also a wide-screen film.
    "Prelude to Revolution" depicts the strike movement and armed uprising of the Russian proletariat under the leadership of the Bolsheviks in 1905 against the rule of the Tsar and the bourgeoisie. "Whirlwind of Hatred" is a historical biographical film depicting the outstanding leader of the Soviet people, Dzerzhinsky, leading the Soviet people and security workers in crushing the conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries to sabotage the Soviet regime in the turbulent years of 1918. "Defenders of the Fortress" depicts a heroic battle fought by the Soviet Red Army defending the Brest Fortress against the German fascist army during the Soviet Patriotic War. "How the Steel Was Tempered" is adapted from the famous novel of the same name. Two films have been made of this novel in the Soviet Union. The one being screened this time is the later color film, which won a silver medal at the 6th World Youth Festival International Film Festival. "Vocation" tells the story of an orphan who lost his parents in World War II and was raised by a passing woman, later becoming a musician.
    "The Bewitched Boy" (adapted from the fairy tale "The Wonderful Adventures of Nils" by Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf), "The Ugly Duckling" (adapted from the autobiographical fairy tale by Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen), and "The Magic Sack" are three distinctive and educational fairy tales.
    This film week is jointly organized by the Ministry of Culture and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. At that time, a delegation of Soviet filmmakers will come to participate in various activities.

　　各大城市将举行“苏联电影周”
    一次规模盛大的“苏联电影周”将于11月7日起在北京、天津、上海和二十七个省市举行。上映的艺术片有“仇恨的旋风”、“坚守要塞”、“天职”、“保尔·柯察金”和“革命的前奏”，童话片“中魔的孩子”、“丑小鸭”和“宝袋”。除“天职”和“坚守要塞”以外，全部是彩色影片，“革命的前奏”还是宽银幕影片。
    “革命的前奏”描写1905年俄国无产阶级在布尔什维克的领导下，为反对沙皇和资产阶级的统治所进行的罢工运动和武装起义。“仇恨的旋风”是一部历史传记片，描写苏联人民杰出的领袖捷尔任斯基在1918年动荡的年代里，领导苏联人民和保卫工作者粉碎了反革命分子企图破坏苏维埃政权的阴谋。“坚守要塞”描写苏联卫国战争时期坚守布列斯特要塞的苏联红军对德寇法西斯军队的一场壮烈的战斗。“保尔·柯察金”是根据著名小说“钢铁是怎样炼成的”改编摄制的。这部小说在苏联曾先后摄制了两部影片，这次上映的是后来拍摄的一部彩色片，曾在第六届青年联欢节国际电影节中获得银质奖章。“天职”叙述了在第二次世界大战中失去父母的一个孤儿，被一个过路的妇女抚养长大，后来成为音乐家的故事。
    “中魔的孩子”（是根据瑞典女作家谢里玛·拉格尔列芙的童话“骑鹅旅行记”改编摄制的）、“丑小鸭”（是根据丹麦作家安徒生的自传体童话改编而成）、“宝袋”，是三部各有特色而富有教育意义的童话片。
    这次电影周是由文化部和中苏友好协会总会联合举办的。届时，苏联电影工作者将派代表团来参加各项活动。
