　　Immediately Mobilize to Overcome the Drought
    Since July and August of this year, most areas in the north and parts of the south have experienced little or no rain, and the drought has persisted for nearly a hundred days. Farmers in Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces have successively launched struggles to fight drought to protect autumn crops and to fight drought to rush planting, protecting tens of millions of mu of autumn seedlings, rushing to plant tens of millions of mu of late autumn crops, and sowing more than 100 million mu of winter wheat. The scale of this drought resistance movement and the high morale of the masses are no less than the production upsurge that came with the cooperative movement in the spring of 1956.
    Although we have achieved great results, the task of fighting drought has not yet been completed. In the northern regions, some winter wheat still needs to be planted in a short period of time, and the sown wheat fields must continue to be protected against drought to preserve the seedlings. In the southern regions, we must continue to sow winter wheat, rapeseed, and other winter crops. Therefore, at present, in these areas, it is still necessary to urgently mobilize, continue to fight against the drought, and use all methods to overcome the drought!
    Next year is the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, and whether next year's agricultural production plan can be completed is greatly related to the current drought resistance struggle. Winter wheat is an extremely important commodity grain, accounting for about 22% of the total grain area and about 13% of the total grain output; the output of rapeseed accounts for about 20% of the edible oil output. Everyone think, if we cannot plant winter wheat and rapeseed on time and well, how much will next year's agricultural production plan be affected? Moreover, most of the areas where drought is occurring in the north are areas where water and drought disasters were severe and harvests were poor this year. Planting winter wheat on time this year and striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year will also greatly help these areas overcome the spring and summer famines next year.
    Now that "Cold Dew" has passed, there is not much time left for sowing winter wheat and rapeseed in the south and north. We must fight against the drought, we must race against time, and try our best to get ahead of it. In areas with insufficient base moisture, we must use the experience of farmers in fighting drought and planting wheat over the years to seize the time to fight drought and sow seeds. In areas with severe drought, we must fully explore and utilize all water sources, use water rationally, and expand the area of drought-resistant wheat planting. "Planting one more mu is one more mu," and "planting one day earlier is better than planting one day later." We must overcome the idea of "relying on heaven for rain" and overcome negative and fearful emotions. Everyone understands that planting winter wheat a few days late may reduce the yield by a few catties or even dozens of catties per mu; if the time is delayed for a long time and it cannot be planted this year, it will be a year missed. What a serious loss this will be!
    In some areas, after the task of fighting drought to protect autumn crops was completed, drought-resistant autumn planting was carried out immediately. People have been quite tired for dozens of days before and after. Some people say, "How long will this drought resistance last?" We say that as long as the drought phenomenon has not been overcome, we should fight it to the end. Of course, in areas where the soil has dried out and there is no water source and cannot be sown immediately, spring wheat seeds should be prepared for late sowing. A small number of areas that really cannot be sown this year should also prepare some spring barley seeds so that they can be sown in the spring to connect with food rations as soon as possible.
    During the drought-resistant wheat planting period, leading cadres at all levels should stop all work that can be left undone or postponed, go deep among the masses, and lead the drought resistance struggle. Farmers need the support of commercial and supply and marketing departments when fighting drought. Responsible cadres going to the countryside in person can promptly discover and solve problems, making it easier to organize various forces into the drought resistance struggle. Zhao Wenfu, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, carried water with the farmers to water the wheat, understood the farmers' ideological status in the drought resistance struggle, and helped the farmers solve the problem of labor for changing ridges, saving labor and improving the quality of watering. This is a very good example. Not only should leading cadres personally go to the countryside to lead farmers in drought-resistant wheat planting, but also government cadres and troops stationed in various regions should go to the countryside to support farmers' drought resistance struggle at the most critical time.
    In some areas, the wheat fields that have been planted through drought resistance and rush planting have experienced seedling shortages and broken ridges. In these areas, we should emphasize "planting one mu and protecting one mu" and continue the struggle to protect seedlings against drought. In order to ensure that the seedlings in the wheat fields are complete and strong, each agricultural cooperative in Shanggao Township, Tai'an County, Shandong Province, timely irrigated 2,500 mu of wheat fields after drought-resistant sowing, so that the seedlings were preserved in these wheat fields. This sowing method is worth learning. Drought-resistant sowing is only the first step. If the seedlings cannot be preserved, not to mention that there is no hope for next year's harvest, the manpower and materials used for sowing will also be wasted. Never do such a stupid thing.
    In the process of drought-resistant sowing, various regions have dug many wells, opened many canals, and even built other water conservancy projects. Many of these water conservancy projects were built hastily. During this winter's water conservancy construction, those that can be consolidated should be repaired and become permanent projects, turning drought-resistant water conservancy into drought-prevention water conservancy and into water conservancy for developing paddy fields.

### 紧急动员起来战胜干旱

　　紧急动员起来战胜干旱
    北方大部地区和南方部分地区，自今年7、8月以来，一直少雨或缺雨，旱象已经延续了近一百天。河南、山西、陕西、山东、安徽、福建、江苏、浙江、湖南、湖北等省农民，陆续展开抗旱保秋、抗旱抢种的斗争，保住了几千万亩秋苗，抢种了几千万亩晚秋作物，播种了一亿多亩冬小麦。这次抗旱运动规模之大，群众情绪之高，不亚于1956年春天随着合作化高潮而来的生产高潮。
    我们虽然已经取得很大的成绩，但是抗旱任务还未完成。北方地区还有部分冬小麦要在短时间以内种下去，已经播种的麦田还要继续抗旱保苗。南方地区更要继续播种冬麦、油菜和别的越冬作物。因此，目前在这些地区还必须紧急地动员起来，继续向干旱作斗争，用一切方法战胜干旱！
    明年是第二个五年计划的第一年，明年的农业生产计划能否完成，和现在进行的抗旱斗争大有关系。冬小麦是极重要的商品粮，种植面积约占粮食总面积22％，产量占粮食总产量的13％左右；油菜籽的产量约占食用油料产量的20％左右。大家想想，如果不能把冬小麦和油菜按时种上、种好，明年的农业生产计划会受多大的影响？而且，现在北方发生干旱现象的地区，大部分是今年水旱灾害严重、收成不好的地区。在今年把冬麦按时种上，争取明年麦季丰收，这对于帮助这些地区克服明年的春荒和夏荒，也有很大的作用。
    现在“寒露”已过，南方、北方能够播种冬麦、油菜的时间都不多了。我们一定要同干旱作斗争，一定要和时间赛跑，尽力赶到它的前面。在底墒不足的地区，要运用农民历年抗旱种麦的经验，抓紧时间抗旱播种。在旱象严重的地区，要充分挖掘和利用一切水源，合理地用水，扩大抗旱种麦的面积。“多种一亩是一亩”，“早种一天好一天”。一定要克服“靠天等雨”的想法，克服消极畏难的情绪。大家都了解，冬小麦晚种几天，每亩可能降低几斤甚至几十斤的产量；如果耽误时间长了，今年种不上，就会错过一年。这将是多么严重的损失！
    有些地区在抗旱保秋任务完成以后，紧接着进行抗旱秋种，前后几十天，人们已经相当疲劳了。有些人说，像这样抗旱“抗到哪一天为止呢”？我们说，只要干旱现象还没有克服，就应该和它斗争到底。当然，在土壤已经干透又无水源、不能立即下种的地区，应该准备春性麦种以备晚播之用。少数实在不能在今年播种的地区，也要准备一部分春大麦种籽，以便来春播种，早早接上口粮。
    在抗旱种麦时期，各级领导干部应该停止一切可以不办或者可以缓办的工作，深入群众之中，领导抗旱斗争。农民在抗旱的时候需要得到商业、供销各个部门的支援。负责干部亲自下乡，就能及时地发现和解决问题，便于把各种力量组织到抗旱斗争中去。中共河南省委书记赵文甫和农民一起担水浇麦，了解农民在抗旱斗争中的思想状况，帮助农民解决改畦劳力的问题，节省了劳动力，并且提高了浇地的质量。这是很好的例子。不仅领导干部应该亲自下乡领导农民抗旱种麦，各个地区的机关干部和驻军也要在最紧张的时候，到农村支援农民的抗旱斗争。
    部分地区抗旱抢种的麦田，已经发生缺苗、断垄的现象。在这些地区应该强调提出“种一亩保一亩”，继续进行抗旱保苗的斗争。山东泰安县上高乡各农业社为了保证麦田的苗全、苗旺，在抗旱播种以后，及时地浇灌麦田两千五百亩，使这些麦田都保住了禾苗。这种播种方法值得学习。抗旱播种只是事情的第一步，如果不能把苗子保住，不要说明年的收获没有指望，播种时用的人力物力也算白费了。决不要作这种傻事。
    各个地区在抗旱播种的过程中打了许多井，开了许多渠，有的还修了别的水利工程。这些水利工程有不少是临时赶修的，应该在今年冬修水利的时候，把可以巩固下来的加以培修，成为永久性的工程，把抗旱的水利变成防旱的水利，变成发展水田的水利。
