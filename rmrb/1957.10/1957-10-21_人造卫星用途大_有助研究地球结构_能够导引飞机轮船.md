Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th dispatch from TASS: Observing artificial satellites makes it possible to draw important conclusions in determining the earth's gravity differences and accurately defining the terrain, according to Soviet Academy of Sciences Corresponding Academician and gravity measurement expert, Molodensky, speaking to a TASS reporter.

He said that based on the moon's orbit, it is already possible to determine one of the most important features of the Earth's structure – the degree of flattening at the Earth's poles. Furthermore, based on the operation of artificial satellites, the magnitude of the flattening can be determined with a hundred times greater precision, because the distance between an artificial satellite and the Earth's center is only about one-fiftieth of the distance between the moon and the Earth's center.

He also said that a comparison of the orbits of several artificial satellites will help to finally determine the size of the earth and the average value of gravity, as well as gravitational deviations (so-called gravity anomalies). Up to now, all these values have been calculated by tens of thousands of observation stations built on the ground through various complex measurements. Hundreds of survey teams have had to go deep into large forests and frozen tundra, swamps and mountains, and other difficult-to-enter areas in order to complete these tasks. These gravity difference measurement works are extremely difficult, and it is precisely because of this that very little research has been carried out in this area in the ocean. By using artificial satellites to study the distribution of vast areas with gravity anomalies in the continents and oceans, we can obtain important information on density perturbations inside the earth, which can help us to determine the concept of crustal structure.

Molodensky said that knowing the speed of an artificial satellite's orbit makes it very convenient to accurately measure the distance between various points on the earth. Up to now, this has been a rather difficult task, because measuring in many segments, in large sections, will inevitably cause errors. The results measured by artificial satellites will have significant practical value for geodesy and cartography.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th dispatch from TASS: The "Soviet Navy Daily" published an article on the 18th stating that artificial satellites can be used as astronomical orienters. With artificial satellites, navigators can determine the position of ships with high accuracy, and can confidently guide ships, stratospheric aircraft, and ionospheric aircraft.

The newspaper pointed out that in order to achieve this goal, it is sufficient to set up several satellites with appropriate positions outside the atmosphere. Personnel on ships and aircraft should know the orbits of the satellites in advance. In order to determine the position of a ship or aircraft, the navigator must record the time when the strongest radio signal from this astronomical orienter (satellite) is received, and use a special table that has calculated the position of the satellite at each moment to find the position of the satellite in space, and then determine the position of his ship or aircraft.

Artificial satellites can also be used to solve some problems related to aerial photography and cartography. Photographic mapping fax can be realized by using telemetry and other equipment. Taking pictures of the Earth's surface from satellites and studying the orbits of satellites will help to determine the terrain and help with geographic research; this will greatly improve the accuracy of aviation and marine charts.

    新华社20日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：观测人造卫星就有可能在对地球的重差测定和确定准确的地形方面作出重要的结论，这是苏联科学院通讯院士、重差测定专家莫洛建斯基对塔斯社记者说的。
    他说，根据月球的运行情况已经可以确定地球结构的最重要特点之一——地球两极的扁平程度。而根据人造卫星运行的情况更可以精确百倍地确定扁平程度的大小，因为人造卫星与地心的距离仅为月亮与地心距离的五十分之一左右。
    他又说，对若干个人造卫星的运行轨道作一比较，会有助于最后确定地球的大小和引力的平均值以及引力偏差（所谓重力异常）。到目前为止，所有这些数值都是由数万个建立在地面上的观测站经过各种复杂的测量而计算出来的。数百个考察队为了完成这些任务必须深入大森林和冻土地带、沼泽和丛山等等很难进入的地区。这些重差测定工作是极其艰难的，也正是因为这个，对海洋领域中这方面的工作还很少进行研究。我们利用人造卫星研究大陆和海洋中具有重力异常现象的辽阔地区的分布情况，就能够得到地球内部密度摄动的重要情报，这可以帮助我们确定对地壳结构的概念。
    莫洛建斯基说，知道人造卫星运行的速度，就可以很便当地准确测定出地球各点之间的距离。到目前为止，这还是一项相当困难的工作，因为分成许多部分、一大段一大段地测量，就必然会造成误差。利用人造卫星测量出来的结果对测地学和地图制图学将有重大的实践价值。
    新华社20日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“苏联海军报”18日发表文章说，人造卫星可以用作天文定向器。有了人造卫星，领航员们就可以高度精确地确定轮船的位置，并且可以有把握地导引轮船、同温层飞机和电离层飞机。
    报纸指出，为了达到这个目的，在大气层以外设置若干个位置分布适当的卫星就够了。轮船和飞机上的人员应该事先知道卫星的运行轨道。为了确定轮船或飞机的位置，领航员要记下收到这个天文定向器（卫星）的最强的无线电讯号的时间，用已经计算出每一时刻的卫星位置的专门表格找出卫星在空间的位置，然后确定自己的轮船或飞机的位置。
    利用人造卫星还可以解决同航空摄影和地图制图学有关的一些问题。利用遥测和其他一些设备就可以实现摄影制图传真。从卫星上拍摄地球表面的照片和研究卫星的运行轨道，有助于确定地形，有助于地理研究；这样就能大大提高航空和航海地图的精确程度。
