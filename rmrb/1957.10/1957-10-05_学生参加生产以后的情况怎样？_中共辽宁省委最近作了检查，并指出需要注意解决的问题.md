What is the Situation After Students Participate in Production?
The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Recently Conducted an Inspection and Pointed Out Problems That Need Attention and Resolution

(Reported by this newspaper) This year, the 140,000 middle and primary school graduates in Liaoning Province who participated in agricultural production have been praised by the broad masses of farmers. The vast majority of students have demonstrated high labor enthusiasm, a spirit of hard work, obedience to leadership, and diligent study of agricultural techniques in production. Some students have already earned the honorary title of outstanding commune members in their work. Some students are not only determined to settle down in the countryside but also encourage their relatives to move to the countryside.

The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is very concerned about this new force on the agricultural front. It recently inspected the participation of middle and primary school graduates in agricultural production and believes that although the overall situation is good, some problems still exist. For example, some township and commune cadres have failed to actively arrange for students returning to their hometowns to participate in production. Students living collectively sometimes don't get enough to eat because they arrive late after work. Some commune cadres have not provided enough care for graduates' housing conditions, studies, and living difficulties. More importantly, some local Party committees have not paid enough attention to the ideological education of students who have gone to the countryside to work, and a small number of students still hold a "wait-and-see" attitude.

Because the Provincial Committee promptly pointed out the above problems, various localities have successively strengthened the work of consolidating the participation of graduates in agricultural production. Xin Jin, Hei Shan, and other counties are conducting a general inspection and resolving the problems existing in students' participation in production. Some agricultural cooperatives in Shenyang, Andong, Liaozhong, and other places are systematically carrying out political and ideological education work in response to students' ideological situations. Some agricultural cooperatives in the Andong area have taken the initiative to study with students, changing large groups of dozens of people into small groups of five or six people and assigning them to live in the homes of old commune members. This approach not only makes it easier for students to integrate with farmers but also makes it easier to eat comfortably. Many agricultural cooperatives have already begun to organize students to learn agricultural techniques. In strengthening cultural life, some communes in Jin County have added new books for students and are carrying out various cultural and sports activities. Facts have proved that as long as we care about students participating in production politically, ideologically, in their studies, and in their lives, it will play a positive role in consolidating their participation in agricultural production.

    学生参加生产以后的情况怎样？
    中共辽宁省委最近作了检查，并指出需要注意解决的问题
    本报讯　今年辽宁省参加农业生产的十四万中、小学毕业生受到了广大农民的齐声赞扬。学生们在生产中绝大多数表现了高涨的劳动热情，吃苦耐劳、服从领导和努力学习农业技术的精神；有的同学在劳动中已经获得了优秀社员的光荣称号；有的同学不但下决心在农村中安家落户，而且还鼓励自己的亲人搬到乡下来。
    中共辽宁省委对这支农业战线上的生力军十分关怀，最近检查了中、小学毕业生参加农业生产的情况，认为总的情况虽然很好，但还存在一些问题。例如：有的乡、社干部对回乡参加生产的学生未能主动把他们安排到生产中去；集体生活的学生，由于收工先后不一，有时晚来的吃不好；有的社干部对毕业生的居住条件、学习、生活上的困难照顾还不够。更值得注意的是，有的地方党委对下乡生产的学生的思想教育工作注意不够，少数学生还抱着“骑马找马”的态度。
    由于省委及时指出了上述问题，现在各地已先后加强了巩固毕业生参加农业生产的工作。新金、黑山等县正在普遍检查和解决学生参加生产中存在的问题；沈阳、安东、辽中等地有些农业社，针对学生思想情况，系统地进行政治思想教育工作；安东地区有的农业社主动和学生研究，把几十个人的大组改为五六个人的小组，分配寄居在老社员家里，这样的做法，既便于学生和农民打成一片，伙食又容易吃得舒适；不少农业社已经开始组织学生学习农业技术。在加强文化生活方面，金县有的社为学生们增添了新图书，并开展各项文娱体育活动。事实证明，只要从政治思想上、学习上和生活上关心参加生产的学生，对巩固他们参加农业生产会起积极作用。
