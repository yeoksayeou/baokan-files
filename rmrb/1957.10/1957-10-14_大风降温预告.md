    Strong Wind and Cooling Forecast
    (Our newspaper reports) On October 13th at 7:00 PM, the Central Meteorological Science Research Institute released a strong wind forecast:

    Cold air is entering northern Xinjiang in our country from the Soviet Union. Currently, the cold air is continuing to move in a generally easterly direction. It is predicted that within the next 24 hours, the Hexi Corridor will experience northwesterly winds of around force 6, and temperatures will also drop by 8-10 degrees Celsius. The central and western parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will have westerly winds of force 6-7, and the southern part of the Northeast Plain and the Bohai Sea will have southwesterly winds of force 5-6. The Hebei Plain and western Shandong will also have southwesterly winds of around force 5.

    A tropical depression has appeared in the South China Sea. At 2:00 PM on October 13th, its center was estimated to be at 15.9 degrees north latitude and 119.5 degrees east longitude. The maximum wind force near the center is approximately force 8-9. Currently, the center of the low pressure is moving in a west-northwesterly direction at a speed of 10-15 knots per hour. It is predicted that within the next 24 hours, the wind force in the northern part of the South China Sea will gradually increase to force 6-7, with an easterly wind direction. The Taiwan Strait will still have northeasterly winds of around force 6.
