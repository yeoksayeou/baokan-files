　　Beijing Suburbs have, after a month of vigorous airing of views, now entered the stage of large-scale socialist debates. Among them, the eight pilot townships have entered a climax, with the majority of production teams having held more than four debate sessions, some even reaching over ten sessions. Most townships started with debates on the issue of collectivization, while some started with debates on the issue of unified purchase and sale of grain.

　　Through the debates, profound changes have taken place in the thinking of the broad masses of peasants. Poor and lower-middle peasants have further strengthened their confidence in taking the road of collectivization. They said: This debate is excellent, and our socialist banner is preserved! Some well-to-do middle peasants have realized that the capitalist road is impassable and expressed their willingness to take the socialist road. Peasants who had withdrawn from cooperatives, feeling ashamed, are now requesting to rejoin. The activities of reactionary landlords and rich peasants have been severely cracked down upon, and they no longer dare to speak or act recklessly.

　　On the basis of the improved socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants, a new atmosphere has emerged in the suburban countryside. Labor attendance rates have increased unprecedentedly. According to incomplete statistics from the eight pilot townships, the attendance rate of many cooperatives has risen from 80% in the past to 90%, and some have even reached 100%. Cooperative members say: "In the past, working was like sheep; now, working is like tigers and wolves," and "In the past, work waited for people; now, people wait for work."

　　Believe in the Majority and Dispel Worries

　　The experience of the large-scale debates in the suburbs proves that, like any work, in the large-scale debates, it is necessary to firmly implement the mass line and mobilize the broad masses to participate in the debates to ensure good debates. At the beginning of the debates, some local leaders did not adequately rely on and believe in the vast majority of the masses, so they were somewhat constrained when leading the debates. As a result, not only were the broad masses not mobilized, but also the enthusiasm of the activists was suppressed, making them afraid to speak boldly at the meetings. Thus, the debates could not gain momentum. Some places that paid attention to correcting this deviation saw a great improvement in the situation. For example, when debating the issue of collectivization in Babao Mountain Township, well-to-do middle peasant Du Fu believed that collectivization was the poor peasants taking advantage of the middle peasants. In the first few debates, only a few people spoke, and the debate seemed weak. Du Fu not only did not yield but instead attacked the poor and lower-middle peasants, saying, "When I joined the cooperative, I brought in a cart and mule. What did you bring in? You came in with bare bottoms." Later, after widely mobilizing the masses, the debates became lively and colorful, with extremely enthusiastic participation. Zhao Debao, a poor peasant who had never spoken at meetings before, also stood up to refute Du Fu, saying, "You brought in a cart and mule when you joined the cooperative, but the cooperative did not take advantage of you for nothing. It gave you a price. We also brought in seeds and fertilizer!" Poor peasant Wu Hongyi said: You brought in four camels, two mules, and a cart when you joined the cooperative, valued at 800 yuan. You thought it was too low, so it was re-evaluated and increased to 1,400 yuan. Your labor share was 160 yuan, and ours was also 160 yuan. This is completely fair and reasonable. The poor peasants did not take advantage of you." Poor peasant Wu Hongzhi said even better, "It is not a matter of the poor peasants taking advantage of you, but a matter of your thinking not being resolved. Even if you are given 800 yuan, you think it's too little. Even if it's increased to 1,400 yuan, you still think it's too little. No matter how much more you are given, you will still think it's too little. You want to pull the cart out to engage in exploitation and take advantage of others." At this point, the masses questioned Du Fu, asking who was trying to take advantage of whom? Faced with the facts, Du Fu was left speechless and had to admit: The poor peasants did not take advantage of me; I was trying to take advantage of others.

　　Of course, mobilizing the masses to participate in the socialist debate is not easy. Everyone has various concerns. Especially when criticizing the capitalist ideas of a few well-to-do middle peasants, some people say, "We are all one family, and we will be working together in the future!" Therefore, some debates, at the beginning, had the phenomenon of each person presenting their own facts without engaging with each other. How to dispel these concerns? Some townships have adopted the form of holding "back-to-back" meetings, that is, convening small-scale forums for these people, asking them to expose materials and introduce the situation. However, this alone is not enough. At the general meeting, some people still dare not speak. Therefore, it is also necessary to help them analyze and study the materials, and improve their awareness and arm their thinking through analysis and research. After the poor and lower-middle peasants in Zhao Xin Dian Township exposed, analyzed, and studied the materials of Xie Delong, a well-to-do middle peasant and individual household, who opposed collectivization and lured cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperative, they were shocked. They said, "The benefits of collectivization are endless. How can we let them break it up?" From then on, at every debate, they were the pioneers who charged forward. Many people not only actively spoke at the meetings, but also, during breaks and during production, did not let go of any opportunity to engage in "small-scale debates" or "individual debates" with Xie Delong. Of course, in addition to starting with the analysis and study of specific situations to improve the consciousness of the masses, it is also necessary to clearly explain to the poor and lower-middle peasants the nature, significance, and purpose of this large-scale debate from a positive perspective.

　　Persuading People with Reason, Repeatedly Arguing

　　The experience of the suburban debates also proves that in the debates, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of convincing people with reason, calmly presenting the facts and reasoning, in order to achieve the purpose of educating the masses. In this regard, many townships have done very well. For example, when debating the issue of whether there was enough grain to eat in Machikou Township, well-to-do middle peasant Yang Xiuzhen shouted that "there is not enough grain to eat." When many people presented the facts and reasoned with her, Yang Xiuzhen not only refused to admit her mistake but also made a scene at the meeting, scolding the activists. Under these circumstances, the masses of the township still repeatedly used methods of recollection and comparison to settle three accounts with her. The first account was: Comparing the grain consumption of peasants before and after liberation, calculate whether the grain of the peasants is more or less now? After calculating, it was clearly seen that before liberation, many people in Machikou Township lived on a diet of chaff and vegetables for half the year. Now, no household is eating wild vegetables to survive. Not only that, but the vast majority of families have already replaced porridge with dry rice, and they often eat refined grains. Some peasants said, "I have eaten back half of my life's refined grains this year." The second account was: Calculating whether the grain left by the state for the peasants since liberation has increased year by year or decreased year by year? Taking Beijing as an example, in the 1956 to 1957 grain year, the per capita annual assessment of the entire suburban agricultural population was 379.18 jin, an increase of 16.41 jin compared to the previous grain year. The third account was: From among the households with enough to eat, find a household with a roughly similar situation to compare with her, comparing population, supply, and consumption. A woman named Gu Shulan settled this account with Yang Xiuzhen. She said, "Our two families have the same supply standard and roughly the same population. I have enough to eat. Why don't you have enough to eat?" In this way, Yang Xiuzhen no longer shouted about the lack of grain. In addition, some places did not present facts and reason but adopted simple and crude methods such as labeling with big hats, resulting in erroneous ideas not being criticized, nor could they achieve the purpose of educating the masses, and even leading to adverse consequences. When criticizing the well-to-do middle peasant Liu Shougui in Pingxifu Township, Changping District, some people did not reason but simply and rudely asked Liu to stand up. As a result, no problem was solved.

　　The Deeper the Airing, the More Thorough the Debate

　　The suburban experience proves that in order to debate deeply and thoroughly, all kinds of erroneous opinions must be aired and participate in the debate, so that right and wrong can become clearer the more they are debated. When Zhao Xin Dian Township debated the issue of collectivization, middle peasant Li Quan believed that "the income of peasants decreased after advanced collectivization." Poor peasant Che Wang immediately raised objections, saying: After collectivization, my income has increased year by year. Before collectivization, I cultivated five or six mu of sloping land. Converted to grain, my annual income was less than 150 yuan. After joining the primary cooperative, my income increased to 330 yuan. In 1956, I joined the advanced cooperative, and my income increased to more than 370 yuan. This year, it is estimated to increase to 400 yuan. Do you say that this is an increase in income or a decrease in income? Faced with the facts, Li Quan admitted that grain income had increased after collectivization, but he said: The overall income of peasants has decreased. The reason is that before joining the cooperative, he could drive a cart. Driving a cart for a month would bring in 20 or 30 yuan. Now, that income is gone. Yang Zhanxian disagreed with this opinion. He said, "Before collectivization, only a few rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants could drive carts. Where would most poor peasants have carts?" He believed that Li Quan's attachment to the days of "driving carts" was actually the capitalist ideology at work. At this point, another well-to-do middle peasant asked, "Li Quan is neither a rich peasant nor a capitalist. Where did his capitalist ideology come from?" Poor peasant Guo Zhenhua said, "If we follow Li Quan's thinking, it would mean not having collectivization and letting a few people drive carts, so that this part of the people become richer and richer, and most poor and lower-middle peasants become poorer and poorer. Isn't this precisely taking the capitalist road? Isn't this precisely capitalist ideology?" Everyone agreed with this view.

　　Improving Work Promotes Debate

　　Experience also proves that timely improvement of leadership and production according to everyone's reasonable opinions can encourage everyone's enthusiasm for participating in debates and production. For example, in debating the issue of collectivization, some places not only solved the issue of whether collectivization was superior or not but also actively researched and improved the work style of cooperative and team cadres and the management of cooperatives and teams based on the opinions of the masses, paying attention to educating and reforming lazy people, hooligans, and idlers who did not work, did not obey leadership, and were mischievous. The first and second groups of the West Street Team of Babao Mountain Township have formulated a "Love the Cooperative Pledge" based on the results of everyone's discussion, which the masses are very satisfied with. Chenguang Agricultural Cooperative in Luquan Township established a work improvement group to study the opinions raised by cooperative members, and have already resolved forty-three major issues. Cooperative members feel that raising opinions is useful, so they actively participate in the large-scale debates. In the vigorous airing of views in Zhao Xin Dian Township, 572 opinions on improving work were raised, and 90% of them have been processed or are being processed. Most of the reasonable ones have been adopted and are being studied for improvement; explanations have also been given for those that need to be explained; and some issues belonging to the work style of cadres have been reviewed by the parties involved in the masses. At the same time, the above-mentioned handling situation was also reported to the masses in the broadcasting booth, and the masses responded well.

### 充分发动群众　坚持以理服人  京郊八个试点乡大辩论进入高潮

    充分发动群众　坚持以理服人
    京郊八个试点乡大辩论进入高潮
    本报讯　北京市郊区经过一个月的大鸣大放，目前已转入社会主义大辩论，其中八个试点乡已进入辩论高潮，绝大多数生产队都开过四次以上的辩论会，有些已达到十次以上。多数乡是从辩论合作化问题入手的，也有一部分乡从辩论粮食统购统销问题入手。
    经过辩论，广大农民在思想上起了深刻变化，贫农、下中农更加增强了走合作化道路的信心。他们说：这次辩论会太好了，咱们社会主义的大旗保住了；一部分富裕中农已经认识到资本主义道路走不通，表示愿意走社会主义道路。退出合作社的农民带着惭愧的心情，要求入社；反动地主、富农的活动，遭到了严厉的打击，不敢再乱说乱动。
    在广大农民社会主义觉悟提高的基础上，郊区农村呈现出一片新气象，劳动出勤率空前提高，据八个试点乡的不完全统计：许多社的出勤率都由过去的80％，上升到90％，有些社还达到百分之百。社员说：“过去干活似绵羊，现在干活赛虎狼”，“过去是活等人干，现在是人等活干”。
    相信多数解除顾虑
    郊区大辩论的经验证明：和任何工作一样，大辩论中，也必须坚定地贯彻群众路线，发动广大群众参加辩论，才能辩论好。在开始大辩论时，部分地区领导上依靠和相信群众的绝大多数的思想不够，因此领导辩论时，有些束手束脚，结果，不仅广大群众没有发动起来，也压抑了积极分子的积极性，使积极分子在会上不敢大胆发言。这样，辩论会就辩论不起来。有些地方注意纠正了这一偏向，情况就大大改观。如八宝山乡在辩论合作化问题时，富裕中农杜甫认为：合作化是贫农占中农的便宜。头几次辩论会，总是少数几个人发言，辩论显得无力，杜甫不仅没有低头，反而向贫农和下中农进攻说：“我入社拿了大车、骡子，你们入社拿的什么？你们是光了屁股进来的。”后来经过广泛发动群众，辩论会就开得有声有色，发言极为踊跃，一向开会不发言的贫农赵德宝，也站起来驳斥杜甫说：“你入社拿进大车、骡子，社里并没有白沾你的，而是给你折了价，我们入社也拿了种子、肥料呀！”贫农武洪义说：你入社拿了四条骆驼，两条骡子，一辆大车，折价八百元，你嫌低，后来又重新评价，增至一千四百元。你入社的劳动股金是一百六十元，我们也是一百六十元，这完全是公平合理的，贫农并没有占你的便宜。”贫农武洪志说得更好，“不是贫农占你的便宜的问题，而是你的思想没有解决问题，给你折八百元，你嫌少，增加到一千四百元，你还是嫌少，给你再多，你也是嫌少，你想把车拉出去搞剥削，占人家的便宜。”这时，群众纷纷责问杜甫，究竟谁想占谁的便宜？杜甫在事实面前，理屈词穷，只好承认：贫农没有占我的便宜，是我想占人家的便宜。
    当然，要发动群众参加社会主义大辩论，并不是很容易的事情，大家有着各种各样的顾虑，特别是对少数富裕中农的资本主义思想进行批判时，有些人就说：“咱们都是一家人，将来还要在一块儿干活呢！”因此，某些辩论会在开始时，曾发生各人摆各人的事实，互不交锋的现象。怎样解除这些顾虑呢？有些乡采取了召开“背靠背”会议的形式，即召集这些人开小型座谈会，请他们揭发材料，介绍情况。但是，仅仅这样是不够的，到了大会上，有些人还是不敢发言，因此，还必须帮助他们分析、研究材料，从分析研究材料中，提高他们的觉悟，武装他们的思想。赵辛店乡贫农、下中农在揭发、分析、研究了富裕中农、单干户谢德隆反对合作化、拉拢社员退社的材料后，大吃一惊，他们说：“合作化的好处说不完，怎么能让他们搞散伙。”以后在每次辩论会上，他们都是冲锋陷阵的先锋。许多人不仅在会上积极发言，在会后休息、生产的时候，也不放松任何一个机会，和谢德隆展开“小型辩论”或“个别辩论”。当然除了从分析研究具体情况入手，提高群众觉悟外，还要从正面向贫农下中农讲清楚这次大辩论的性质、意义和目的。
    以理服人反复论争
    郊区辩论的经验还证明：在辩论中，要坚持以理服人的原则，平心静气地摆事实、讲道理，才能达到教育群众的目的。在这个问题上，有许多乡是做得很好的，如马池口乡在辩论粮食够吃不够吃的问题时，富裕中农杨秀珍叫嚷“粮食不够吃”，当许多人和她摆事实、讲道理时，杨秀珍不仅不承认错误，反而大闹会场，大骂积极分子，在这种情况下，该乡群众仍然几次三番地通过回忆、对比的办法，和她算清了三笔账，第一笔账是：对比解放前后农民粮食的消费情况，算算目前农民的粮食是多了？还是少了？一算之下，清楚地看到：解放前，马池口乡许多人过着糠菜半年粮的日子，如今，已经没有一户吃野菜度日的，不仅如此，绝大部分人家已经把稀饭换成了干饭，而且经常吃细粮。有的农民说：“我这一年把我前半辈子的细粮都吃回来了。第二笔账是：算一算解放以来国家给农民留的粮食是逐年增加了？还是逐年减少了？拿北京市来说：在1956到1957粮食年度，全郊区农业人口每人全年评定三百七十九点一八斤，比上一年粮食年度增加了十六点四一斤。第三笔账是：从够吃的户中间，找出一户情况和他大体相同的和他作对比，比人口，比供应量，比消费量。有一个叫谷淑兰的妇女，就和杨秀珍算了这笔账，她说：“咱们两家供应标准一样，人口也差不多，我够吃，你为什么不够吃？”这样杨秀珍就不再叫喊缺粮了。另外有些地方不是摆事实、讲道理，而是采取扣大帽子等简单粗暴的办法，结果错误思想受不到批判，也不能达到教育群众的目的，甚至还会引起不良后果。昌平区平西府乡批判富裕中农刘守贵时，有些人就不是说道理，只是粗暴地要刘站起来，结果，什么问题也没有解决。
    放得愈深辩得愈透
    郊区的经验证明：要辩论得深，辩论得透，就要让各种错误意见放出来都参加辩论，这样，是非就可以愈辩愈明。赵辛店乡在辩论合作化问题时，中农李全认为：“高级合作化以后，农民的收入减少了”。贫农车旺立即提出反对意见，他说：合作化后，我的收入年年增加。合作化前，我种了五、六亩上坡地，以粮折钱，每年收入不满一百五十元，参加初级社后，收入增至三百三十元，1956年参加了高级社，收入又增至三百七十多元，今年估计会增至四百元。你说：这是收入增加了？还是收入减少了？李全在事实面前，承认了合作化以后粮食收入是增加了，但是他说：农民整个收入减少了，理由是：没有入社以前，可以赶大车，赶一个月大车，收入就是二、三十元，现在这项收入就没有了。杨占先不同意这个意见，他说：“合作化以前，能够赶得上大车的只是少数富农和富裕中农，大多数贫农，那里会有大车？”他认为李全留恋“赶大车”的日子，实际上是资本主义思想在作怪。这时，另一富裕中农提出：“李全既非富农，又非资本家，那来的资本主义思想？”贫农郭振华说：“如果照李全的思想，就是不要合作化，让少数人去赶大车，这部分人越干越有钱，大部分贫农和下中农越来越穷，这不正是走了资本主义道儿了，这不正是资本主义思想”。大家都同意这个看法。
    改进工作推动辩论
    经验还证明：及时按照大家的合理的意见，改进领导、改进生产，就可以鼓舞大家参加辩论的积极性和生产积极性，比如辩论合作化问题，有些地方不仅解决了合作化优越不优越的问题，而且根据群众意见，积极研究改进社、队干部作风以及社、队的管理工作，注意教育和改造不劳动、不服从领导、调皮捣蛋的懒汉、地痞、二流子等人。八宝山乡西街队一、二组已根据大家讨论的结果，制订了一个“爱社公约”，群众很满意。鹿圈乡晨光农业社建立了改进工作小组，对社员提出的意见进行了研究，已经解决了四十三个较大的问题，社员感到提意见顶事，就更加积极地参加大辩论。赵辛店乡群众在大鸣大放中，提出各种改进工作的意见五百七十二条，已经处理或正处理的占90％以上，其中合理的大部分采纳了，正研究改进中；需要解释的也作了解释；属于干部作风问题的有一些已由当事人在群众中作了检讨。同时，还将以上处理情况在广播筒中向群众作了报告，群众反映很好。
