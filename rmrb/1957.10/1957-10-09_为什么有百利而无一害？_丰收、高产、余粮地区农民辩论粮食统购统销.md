Why is it entirely beneficial and without a single harm?
Farmers in areas with good harvests, high yields, and surplus grain debate the unified purchase and sale of grain

(Our dispatch) Has the unified purchase and sale of grain been beneficial to areas with good harvests, high yields, and surplus grain? Recently, cadres and masses in Kangshu Village in Shanxi, Songjiang County in Jiangsu, Shantou Agricultural Cooperative in Ying'ebuxiang in Jilin, and other places have launched a major debate on this issue. They have cited many facts to forcefully refute the fallacy spread by landlords, rich peasants, and some well-to-do middle peasants that the unified purchase and sale of grain is "entirely harmful and without a single benefit" to these areas; at the same time, they have corrected the confused ideas of some of the masses.

Kangshu Village in Yongji County, Shanxi Province, has been a surplus grain village for many years, with a total of 181 households. Since the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain in 1953, it has been able to sell more than 140,000 catties of surplus grain to the state every year. This spring, when bourgeois right-wingers were frantically attacking, some lawless landlords, rich peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas also took the opportunity to attack the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. They said: The policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is good for grain-deficient cooperatives and grain-deficient peasants, but it is entirely harmful and without a single benefit for surplus grain peasants and surplus grain cooperatives.

What is the actual situation? The Kangshu Village Party Group of the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative led the masses in launching a major debate on this issue.

Although Kangshu Village sells more than 140,000 catties of grain to the state every year, does every household have surplus grain? No. Among the 181 households in the village, 67 households used to regularly experience food shortages, sell immature crops, and even beg for food. At the same time, there were also 81 self-sufficient households who, when faced with natural disasters or man-made calamities, also suffered from food shortages and exploitation. Only 33 households truly had surplus grain every year. During the debate, many peasants recalled the tragic situation before liberation and used personal examples to refute the reactionary statement that "unified purchase and sale is entirely harmful and without a single benefit to surplus grain villages." Jing Wangwang said: "Before liberation, I was also from a surplus grain village, but my family often lacked food and clothing, and I begged for food; after the unified purchase and sale of grain, my family's life has improved year by year, and the grain distributed last year was not only enough to eat, but also had a surplus." Li Shulin said: "During the rule of the Yan bandit, I often had nothing to eat for the next meal after eating this one. One year, when the wheat was still flowering, I couldn't borrow any grain, so I had to sell four mu of land that could yield four or five shi of wheat to the landlord for the price of three shi and two dou. There was no unified purchase and sale at that time, so why was my life so bitter?" Li Sanwa, who was 65 years old, said: "In 1945, I borrowed one shi of grain and repaid three shi after the wheat harvest. Which of the poor peasants here haven't suffered from the high interest rates in the past?"

Jie Hengjing, Li Fengnian, and others also explained the benefits of unified purchase and sale to surplus grain villages from another perspective. Li Fengnian said: "Our village is a village with few people and a lot of land. In the past, who in our family could afford to apply fertilizer to their land every year? After the unified purchase and sale of grain, the state supplied us with chemical fertilizers, helping our grain yield to increase from 144 catties per mu in 1953 to 190 catties per mu this year. How can you say that unified purchase and sale is not beneficial to our surplus grain village?" Jie Mingyi said: "If there were no workers manufacturing chemical fertilizers, even if we turned the land over and over, we wouldn't be able to harvest more than 190 catties of grain." Li Fengman said: "This year, the state supplied our village with more than 26,000 catties of fertilizer to support our increased production; but when it comes to selling our surplus grain, why can we turn around and say that the workers didn't support us and that unified purchase and sale is not beneficial to our surplus grain village?"

More people used concrete facts to illustrate the happy scene that the unified purchase and sale policy and the realization of cooperativization have brought to the lives of farmers in surplus grain villages. Before liberation, more than half of the poor peasants in the village worked as long-term laborers, ate the rent, and were exploited; now they live a happy life with abundant food and clothing. Before liberation, only Li Yuhe's family in the village had a thermos; now almost every family has one. Before liberation, only the children of landlords and rich peasants could wear fine cloth and cover themselves with colorful quilts; now poor peasants also wear fine cloth clothes, cover themselves with Gongni quilts, and lay on Pacific bed sheets. Before liberation, only the children of landlords and rich peasants could go to school, but now the children of poor peasants also go to school. There are now 15 people in the village who attend middle school alone, more than double the number before liberation.

The facts educated the farmers of Kangshu Village, and many people said in unison: Unified purchase and sale is not entirely harmful and without a single benefit to our surplus grain village, but rather entirely beneficial and without a single harm. We resolutely support the policy of unified purchase and sale.

Is the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain good for high-yield areas? This question once caused a debate at the enlarged meeting of the Songjiang County and Township Party Committee in Jiangsu Province. The question was initially raised by some cadres in Tingxin Township. They said: Songjiang is a high-yield grain area, and anyway, there is a lot of grain, so even if we don't implement unified purchase and sale, we won't starve. Implementing unified purchase and sale is only beneficial to grain-deficient areas. During the discussion, most people disagreed with this view. They believed that the state's implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain can ensure that everyone has food to eat, which is not only beneficial to grain-deficient areas, but also to all regions of the country. Some cadres in Tianma Township said: We only look at whether unified purchase and sale is beneficial to Songjiang, which is a selfish and individualistic idea. You say that farmers in Songjiang will not starve, but what about the people in other regions who are starving? 600 million people across the country need to eat, so we must support each other in terms of grain. If grain-growing areas in Songjiang don't sell grain, cotton-growing areas in Pudong will have nothing to eat. If cotton-growing areas in Pudong don't sell cotton, or if they convert cotton fields into grain fields, we will have no clothes to wear. You can eat grain from planting grain, but you can't wear grain from planting grain. At this point, some people again cited concrete facts to illustrate that if unified purchase and sale is not implemented in grain-growing areas and high-yield areas, people will still starve. Lin Mingfa, the secretary of the Dasting Cooperative branch, said: "High-yield areas are not necessarily high-yield every year, and surplus grain areas are not necessarily good harvests every year. Our Dasting Cooperative is also in a high-yield area, but in the big flood years before liberation, most people starved. We also suffered from floods in 1954, but because unified purchase and sale was implemented and the state implemented the policy of using surplus to make up for deficits, we bought 120,000 catties of food grain, so we didn't go hungry." Cadres of the Hongxing Cooperative in Gusong Township added that even in high-yield areas and surplus grain areas, there is a distinction between surplus grain cooperatives and grain-deficient cooperatives, and even within the same high-yield cooperative and surplus grain cooperative, there is a distinction between surplus grain households and grain-deficient households. Without unified purchase and sale to adjust surpluses and deficiencies, most people in high-yield and surplus grain areas will still not have enough to eat.

After the debate, everyone basically understood the principle that unified purchase and sale is beneficial to all regions. In order to further improve understanding, the meeting also adopted a method of positive recall and comparison to calculate the three major accounts since the unified purchase and sale: the reasonable grain price account, the avoidance of high-interest exploitation account, and the stable price account. After discussing and calculating the accounts in many groups, they came to the conclusion: "The unified purchase and sale of grain is not just a matter of a few catties of grain going in and out, but a major issue related to whether peasants take the socialist road to common prosperity or the capitalist road of 'one family rich, ten thousand families poor'."

The policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is not only beneficial to the people in cities and disaster areas, but also to farmers in areas with good harvests. Members of the Shantou Agricultural Cooperative in Ying'ebuxiang, Tonghua County, Jilin Province, used their personal experience to illustrate this issue.

At the meeting to debate the issue of unified purchase and sale of grain, many members of the Shantou Cooperative recalled the past. Before liberation, they looked forward to a good harvest in the autumn from the time they planted the land in the spring, hoping to harvest more grain and sell it for more money, but this wish was never realized. In 1936, there was a bumper harvest of crops in Shantou, and when the hoes were hung up, the market price of corn was 22 yuan per shi. The peasants were very happy and were planning to sell the grain in the autumn to add some cotton clothes. Who knew that when the crops were harvested, the grain price suddenly fell, and the corn price fell from 22 yuan per shi to 6 yuan per shi. Because the peasants were in urgent need of money to repay debts and make cotton clothes, they had to sell the grain at a low price with great pain. But when it came time to plant the land the following year, the grain price rose again to more than 20 yuan per shi. With this one-way flip, the peasants became poorer, and the grain dealers, landlords, and rich peasants became richer. What is the situation now? The cooperative members said: The phenomenon of low grain prices in autumn and high grain prices in spring no longer exists. Whether it is a good or bad harvest, the grain price remains stable, and we are no longer afraid of "good harvests where grain is worthless."

The peasants of the Shantou Cooperative also talked about another benefit of the unified purchase and sale of grain, that is, it has established a style of thrift and overcome losses and waste. In the past, the peasants in Shantou had no plan for eating and using grain. In years of good harvests, they used grain to make powder, feed chickens and ducks, and squandered it at will; now there is a quota for eating grain, and no one can squander it recklessly.

    为什么有百利而无一害？
    丰收、高产、余粮地区农民辩论粮食统购统销
    本报讯　粮食统购统销对丰收、高产和余粮地区有没有好处？最近，山西的康蜀村、江苏的松江县、吉林的英额布乡山头农业社等地干部和群众就这个问题展开了大辩论。他们列举许多事实，有力地驳斥了地主、富农和某些富裕中农所谓粮食统购统销对这些地区“有百害而无一利”的谬论；同时，纠正了部分群众的糊涂观念。
    山西永济县康蜀村历年来是个余粮村，全村一百八十一户。自1953年国家实行粮食统购统销以来，每年都能出卖余粮十四万多斤。今年春天，当资产阶级右派分子猖狂进攻的时候，有些不法地主、富农和有严重资本主义思想的富裕中农，也乘机对粮食统购统销政策开火。他们说：统购统销政策对缺粮社、缺粮农民好，对余粮农民、余粮社有百害而无一利。
    实际情况究竟怎么样呢？光明农业社康蜀村党小组领导群众就这个问题展开了大辩论。
    康蜀村虽然每年卖给国家十四万多斤粮食，但是不是家家都有余粮呢？不是的。全村一百八十一户中，就有六十七户过去经常吃斗头，卖青苗，甚至还有讨饭的。同时，还有八十一户是自足户，遇到天灾人祸，也要吃斗头、受剥削。真正年年有余粮的只有三十三户。在辩论中，许多农民回忆了解放前的悲惨情景，用亲身实例反驳“统购统销对余粮村是有百害而没一利”的反动言论。景旺旺说：“解放前我也是余粮村的人，可是我家经常缺吃少穿，拉棍讨饭；粮食统购统销以后，我家的生活一年比一年好，去年分的粮食不但够吃，而且还有余”。李树林说：“阎匪统治时，我常吃了上顿，没下顿。有一年，麦都扬过了花，我借不到一点粮食，后来只得把能打四、五石麦的四亩地，以三石二斗的价卖给了地主。那时倒没实行统购统销，我的生活为啥这样苦呢？”六十五岁的李三娃说：“1945年我借了一石粮食，麦后就还了三石。在座的贫苦农民，过去谁没吃过高利贷的苦呢？”
    介恒敬、李丰年等又从另一方面来说明统购统销对余粮村的好处。李丰年说：“咱村是个人少地多的村子，以前谁家的地能年年上到粪。统购统销以后，国家供给咱们化学肥料，帮助咱们的粮食产量由1953年亩产一百四十四斤，提高到今年亩产一百九十斤。这怎能说统购统销对咱余粮村没有好处呢？”介明义说：“要没有工人制造化学肥料，咱们把那些地翻个个儿，也打不下一百九十多斤粮食。”李丰满说：“今年国家供给咱村两万六千多斤肥料，支援咱们增产；可是轮到咱们卖余粮的时候，为什么能反说工人对咱们没支援，统购统销对咱余粮村没好处呢？”
    更多的人用具体事实说明了统购统销政策和实现合作化给余粮村农民生活带来的幸福景象。解放前，全村有一半以上贫苦农民扛长工、吃租子、受剥削；现在过上了丰衣足食的幸福生活。解放前，全村只有李遇合一家有热水瓶；现在差不多家家都有了。解放前，只有地主、富农才能穿细布、盖花被；现在贫苦农民也穿上了细布衣服，盖上了贡呢被子，铺上了太平洋床单。解放前，只有地主、富农家的子弟才能上学校，现在贫苦农民的儿女也上了学。仅上中学的，现在全村就有十五人，比解放前增加了一倍还多。
    事实教育了康蜀村的农民，很多人异口同声地说：统购统销对我们余粮村不是有百害无一利，而是有百利无一害。我们坚决拥护统购统销政策。
    粮食统购统销政策对高产地区好不好？这个问题，曾经在中共江苏省松江县、乡委委员扩大会议上，引起过一场争论。问题开始是由亭新乡的一些干部提出的。他们说：松江是粮食高产地区，反正粮食多，不实行统购统销，也不会饿肚皮，实行了统购统销，只是对缺粮地区有利。在讨论中，多数人都不同意这种看法。他们认为：国家对粮食实行统购统销，就能保证人人有饭吃，这不只是对缺粮地区有利，对全国各个地区都有利。天马乡有些干部说：我们眼睛只看统购统销是否对松江有利，那是一种自私自利的个人主义思想，你说松江农民不会饿肚皮，别的地区老百姓饿肚皮怎么办？全国六亿人民都要吃饭，在粮食上就得互相支持。松江种粮地区不卖粮，浦东种棉地区就没有吃，如果浦东种棉地区也不卖棉，或者把棉田改成了粮田，我们也就没有衣服穿。种谷吃谷，总不能种谷穿谷。谈到这里，又有人摆出具体事实说明在种粮地区、高产地区不实行统购统销，同样会饿肚皮。大星社支部书记林明发说：“高产地区未必年年高产，余粮地区也不一定年年丰收。我们大星社也是在高产地区，但在解放前的大水年成，却有多数人饿着肚皮。1954年也受到水灾，因为实行了统购统销，国家贯彻以丰补歉方针，我们买进十二万斤口粮，才没有挨饿。”古松乡红星社干部并补充说明，同在高产地区、余粮地区也有余粮社、缺粮社之分，同在一个高产社、余粮社也有余粮户、缺粮户之分，没有统购统销来进行余缺调剂，高产、余粮地区仍旧会有多数人吃不饱。
    经过辩论，大家基本上搞通了统购统销对任何地区都有利的道理。为了进一步提高认识，会议又采取正面回忆对比的办法，算清统购统销以来的三笔大账：粮价合理账、避免高利剥削账、物价稳定账。许多小组在讨论算账以后，得出这样的结论：“粮食统购统销，不只是几斤粮食的出出进进问题，而且是关连着农民走大家富裕的社会主义道路，还是走‘一家富，万户贫’的资本主义道路的大问题。”
    粮食统购统销政策不但对城市和灾区人民有好处，对丰收地区农民也有好处，吉林通化县英额布乡山头农业社的社员用亲身感受说明了这个问题。
    在辩论粮食统购统销问题的会上，山头社的许多社员都回忆起过去的日子。解放前，他们从春天种地时候起就盼望秋天丰收，想多打些粮食多卖几个钱，可是这种愿望总也没有实现。1936年，山头这个地方庄稼大丰收，挂锄的时候市场的苞米每石卖二十二元，农民很高兴，都在盘算着秋后卖了粮添点棉衣。谁知道庄稼上场的时候，粮价忽然落了，苞米由二十二元一石落到六元一石，因为农民急等用钱还债、做棉衣，只好忍痛低价卖粮。可是到第二年种地的时候，粮食又涨到二十多元一石，里外一翻个，穷了农民，富了粮贩子和地主、富农。现在的情况怎么样呢？社员们说：粮价秋低春高的现象再也没有了，无论是粮食丰收、歉收，粮价始终平稳，再不怕“丰收粮食不值钱”了。
    山头社的农民们还谈到粮食统购统销的另一个好处，就是树立了节约的风气，克服了损失浪费。过去山头这个地方的农民吃用粮食没有计划，丰收年就拿粮食泡粉子，喂鸡鸭，随便糟蹋；现在吃粮有定量，谁也不能胡乱糟蹋了。
