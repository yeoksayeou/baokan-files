　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: This reporter learned today that the talks between the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Japanese Visiting Trade Delegation led by Masanosuke Ikeda are proceeding in three groups to resolve outstanding issues.
    Regarding the issue of establishing mutual non-governmental trade representative offices, Masanosuke Ikeda expressed agreement in the plenary session to establish mutual non-governmental trade representative offices, with Chinese representatives not being required to provide fingerprints. However, after entering group discussions, the Japanese side raised the issue of personnel quotas for the representative offices, creating new obstacles to the resolution of the issue. On October 9th, the Japanese side proposed suspending the "agency" group meeting, which caused the group's work to be interrupted for a time. Later, at the suggestion of the Chinese side, the meeting resumed yesterday.
    The other two issues being discussed by both parties are commodity classification adjustments and payment issues. The two sides still have significant differences on these issues and are currently negotiating.
    The talks between the two sides began on September 21st.

　　中国国际贸易促进会和日本访华贸易团分组商谈解决悬案问题
    新华社17日讯　新华社记者今天获悉：中国国际贸易促进委员会与池田正之辅率领的日本访华贸易代表团之间的会谈，正在分三个小组进行解决悬案问题。
    关于双方互设民间的贸易代表机构问题，池田正之辅在全体会议上表示同意互设民间的贸易代表机构，中国代表机构的人员不按指纹。但进入小组讨论后，日本方面又提出代表机构的人数限额问题，使问题的解决发生了新的障碍。到10月9日，日本方面又提议停开“机构”小组会议，因而使这个小组的工作曾一度中断，后来经中国方面的建议，又在昨天复会。
    双方正在商谈的其它两个问题是商品分类调整和支付问题。这两个问题双方尚有重要分歧，目前正在协商中。
    双方的会谈是在9月21日开始的。
