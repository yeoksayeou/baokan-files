For several years, the Soviet Union has been conducting scientific research and experimental design work on building artificial Earth satellites.

As previously reported in newspapers, the Soviet Union had planned to launch the first batch of satellites in accordance with the scientific research plan of the International Geophysical Year.

After a great deal of intensive work by various scientific research institutes and design bureaus, the world's first artificial Earth satellite has been made. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial satellite. According to preliminary materials, the rocket carrying the satellite gave the satellite the necessary orbital speed of about 8,000 meters per second. Currently, the satellite is orbiting the Earth in an elliptical orbit. The satellite's flight can be seen with the simplest optical instruments (binoculars, telescopes, etc.) at sunrise and sunset.

According to calculations (which can now be corrected based on direct observation results), this satellite will operate at an altitude of 900 kilometers above the ground; its orbit will take one hour and thirty-five minutes to complete a full revolution, and the angle of inclination formed between its orbit and the equatorial plane is sixty-five degrees. This satellite will pass over Moscow twice on October 5, 1957 - at 1:46 AM and 6:42 AM Moscow time. Radio stations will regularly report on the subsequent movements of the first artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union on October 4.

The artificial satellite is a spherical body with a diameter of 58 centimeters (Editor's note: equal to 1.75 Chinese feet) and a weight of 83.6 kilograms. It is equipped with two radio transmitters that continuously emit radio signals. Their frequencies are 20.005 and 40.002 megahertz respectively (wavelengths of approximately 15 and 7.5 meters respectively). The power of the transmitters can ensure that a wide range of radio enthusiasts can reliably receive radio signals. The signal is in the form of a telegraph signal, with each signal lasting approximately 0.3 seconds. The interval time is the same. The transmission of one frequency signal takes place during the interval of another frequency signal.

Scientific stations throughout the Soviet Union will observe the satellite and determine its orbital elements. Because the density of the rarefied upper atmosphere is not known for certain, there is currently no data to accurately determine the satellite's lifetime and the location where it enters the dense atmosphere. Calculations show that because the satellite's speed is very high, it will burn up at an altitude of tens of kilometers after it finally enters the dense atmosphere.

As early as the end of the nineteenth century, the outstanding Russian scientist Tsiolkovsky had already scientifically demonstrated for the first time in his works the possibility of achieving space flight with the help of rockets.

The successful launch of the first artificial Earth satellite is a momentous contribution to the world's treasure trove of science and culture. Scientific experiments conducted at such high altitudes are of great significance for understanding the characteristics of outer space and studying the nature of the Earth as a planet in the solar system.

The Soviet Union plans to launch several more artificial Earth satellites during the International Geophysical Year. The size and weight of these later satellites will be increased, and these satellites will be used to implement extensive scientific research plans.

These artificial Earth satellites will pave the way for interstellar travel. Obviously, our generation will certainly be able to witness the liberated and conscious labor of the people of the new socialist society turning mankind's boldest ideals into reality.

Also Reported: According to TASS, the satellite passed over Guangzhou at 17:41 Moscow time (22:41 Beijing time) on October 5.

    苏联跨出了星际旅行的第一步
    第一个人造卫星发射成功
    卫星正在九百公里高空围绕地球运行，昨天经过广州上空
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：塔斯社公报
    几年来苏联一直在进行建造人造地球卫星的科学研究和试验设计工作。
    报纸前已报道，苏联曾经预定按照国际地球物理年的科学研究计划发射第一批卫星。
    经过各科学研究所和设计局的大量的紧张工作，世界上第一个人造地球卫星已经制成。1957年10月4日苏联成功地发射了第一个人造卫星。据初步材料，运送卫星的火箭使卫星获得了每秒八千公尺左右的必要的轨道速度。目前，这个卫星正围绕着地球按椭圆形轨道运行，用最简单的光学仪器（双筒望远镜、单筒望远镜等）在日出和日落的时候可以看到这个卫星的飞行。
  据计算（现在已经可以根据直接观测的结果加以核正），这个卫星将在离地面九百公里的高空运行；它每转一整周的时间将是一小时三十五分钟，它的运行轨道和赤道平面之间所形成的倾斜角是六十五度。这个卫星于1957年10月5日将在莫斯科市区上空经过两次——莫斯科时间夜里一点四十六分和早晨六点四十二分。关于苏联在10月4日放出的第一个人造卫星以后的动态，广播电台将经常加以报道。
    人造卫星是一个球形体，直径五十八公分（编者按：等于市尺一尺七寸半），重八三·六公斤。内装两部不断放射无线电信号的无线电发报机。其频率分别为二○·○○五和四○·○○二兆赫（波长分别为十五和七·五公尺左右）。发报机的功率可以保证广大的无线电爱好者有把握地接收到无线电信号。信号采用电报讯号的形式，每个信号持续时间约○·三秒。间歇时间与此相同。一种频率信号的发送系在另一种频率信号间歇时间进行。
    苏联各地的科学站将对卫星进行观察，并确定它的轨道要素。因为稀薄的大气高层的密度如何，不能确实知道，目前还没有数据能准确测定卫星存在的时间和它进入稠密的大气层的地点。计算表明，因为卫星的速度很高，它在末了进入稠密的大气层之后，即在几十公里的高空烧毁。
    早在十九世纪末，俄国杰出的科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基就已经在他的著作中第一次科学地论证了借助火箭实现宇宙飞行的可能性。
    第一个人造地球卫星的发射成功，对世界科学文化宝库是一项极重大的贡献。在这样的高空中进行的科学实验，对认识宇宙空间的特性和研究地球作为太阳系的行星的性质，具有巨大的意义。
    苏联准备在国际地球物理年期间再发射若干个人造地球卫星。以后发射的这些卫星的体积和重量都要加大和加重，这些卫星将被用来实行广泛的科学研究计划。
    这些人造地球卫星将为实现星际旅行开辟出道路，显然，我们这一代人一定能亲眼看到，社会主义新社会的人们获得解放的和自觉的劳动把人类最大胆的理想变成现实。
    又讯　据塔斯社讯：卫星在10月5日莫斯科时间十七点四十一分（北京时间二十二点四十一分）经过广州上空。
