Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Dear Comrade Premier Kádár, dear comrades of the Hungarian government delegation, dear Comrade Ambassador, comrades, friends:

Today, at this cordial banquet, we are very happy to gather once again with the comrades of the Hungarian government delegation headed by Comrade Kádár.

During their visit to our country, the Hungarian government delegation held cordial talks with our leaders and celebrated our eighth national day with us. The comrades of the delegation visited some factories and universities in Beijing and Shenyang, and had the opportunity to meet enthusiastically with people from all walks of life in Beijing and Shenyang. All this left a deep and unforgettable impression on the people of our country.

The people of China and Hungary have a profound friendship. Both of our countries are engaged in socialist construction. In order to promote common economic upsurge and cultural prosperity, we have been supporting each other politically, economically and culturally, and cooperating closely. In recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have developed rapidly. Our two countries have signed agreements on trade, culture, and scientific and technological cooperation. The two sides have exchanged various delegations for friendly visits and exchanged experiences. The People's Republic of Hungary has supplied our country with a lot of machinery and equipment, cooperated with our country in certain scientific and technological fields, and sent many excellent technical experts to work in our country. The Chinese people cherish and thank the Hungarian people for their help and are willing to continue to work with the Hungarian people to develop the friendly cooperation between our two countries.

Dear Comrade Kádár, this visit to our country by the Hungarian government delegation headed by you, and the cordial talks between the leaders of the two governments, are a new symbol of the development of friendly relations between our two countries. Your visit has not only further deepened the mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between our two countries, but also strengthened the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the noble cause of maintaining world peace. I would like to express my sincere thanks and respect to you once again.

Comrades, friends, I propose:

    For the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Hungary,
    For the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union,
    For the friendly cooperation of the people of all countries in the world,
    For world peace,
    For the health of Comrade Premier Kádár and all comrades of the Hungarian government delegation,
    For the health of Comrade Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Republic of Hungary,
    Cheers!
