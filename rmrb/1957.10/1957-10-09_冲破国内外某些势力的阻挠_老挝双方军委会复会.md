Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th. Vientiane Dispatch: The Joint Military Commission of the Lao Kingdom Government and the Lao Fighting Units resumed its meeting on October 7th, after being adjourned for more than half a year. Prior to this, the Joint Political Commission of both sides had already resumed its meeting on September 16th.

According to the agreement reached by the Lao sides on August 5, 1956, the Joint Political and Military Commissions were formed in September of the same year to be responsible for studying solutions to various issues raised in the joint communique issued by both sides on August 5th of last year. In this joint communique, both sides put forward issues to be studied regarding the establishment of a coalition government, holding supplementary elections, and resolving political and military issues related to the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly.

Subsequently, on December 28th of last year, the Lao sides reached an important agreement on establishing a coalition government to achieve national unity, etc. However, due to the obstruction of certain forces at home and abroad in Laos, especially after the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France separately delivered notes with identical content interfering in Laos' internal affairs to the Lao government on April 16th of this year, the meetings between the two sides were interrupted.

On August 8th, Prince Souvanna Phouma, in his speech requesting authorization to form a cabinet before reorganizing the current cabinet, expressed his position of strictly abiding by the agreement signed by both sides on the establishment of a coalition government, and stated that he would restore the unity of Laos by resolving the issue of the Lao Fighting Units.

At the resumed meeting of the Joint Military Commission on October 7th, both sides exchanged views in general. The next meeting is scheduled to be held on October 10th.

    冲破国内外某些势力的阻挠
    老挝双方军委会复会
    据新华社河内8日电　万象消息：老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队的军事联合委员会在休会了半年多以后，在10月7日复会。在此以前，双方的政治联合委员会已经在9月16日复会。
    根据老挝双方在1956年8月5日达成的协议，双方在同年9月组成了政治和军事联合委员会，以负责研究双方在去年8月5日发表的联合公报中所提出的各个问题的解决办法。双方在这项联合公报中提出了有待研究的关于成立联合政府、举行补充选举以及解决有关桑怒和丰沙里两省的政治、军事等问题。
    在此以后，老挝双方在去年12月28日达成了关于成立联合政府以实现国家统一等重要协议。但是，由于老挝国内外某些势力的阻挠，尤其在英美法三国政府在今年4月16日分别把内容相同的干涉老挝内政的照会交给老挝政府之后，双方的会议即告中断。
    今年8月8日，富马亲王在重新组成现任内阁以前发表的要求授权组阁的演说中，曾经表示要严格遵守双方签订的关于成立联合政府的协议的立场，并且表示将通过解决寮国战斗部队的问题来恢复老挝的统一。
    在10月7日恢复的军事联合委员会的会议上，双方一般地交换了意见。下次会议预定在10月10日举行。
