　　苏联代表团回到北京
    据新华社15日讯　以阿里斯托夫为首的苏联最高苏维埃代表团到中国各地参观后，在今天从沈阳乘飞机回到北京。代表团将继续在北京进行参观访问。
    14日，代表团人员曾在长春、鞍山、沈阳等地参观访问。在参观第一汽车制造厂时，阿里斯托夫向欢迎苏联贵宾们的数千名汽车工人说，我们看到中国在短短的八年中取得这样巨大的成就，从内心感到高兴。陪同贵宾前来参观的中共中央政治局委员、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长彭真，也在这个欢迎会上讲了话。
    阿里斯托夫团长和汽车厂厂长饶斌还在会上互相赠送了礼品。
    这个由苏联帮助建成的汽车厂，开工生产到今天已经整整一周年。当厂长饶斌引导贵宾参观各车间时，男女工人们都聚拢来热烈鼓掌欢迎，并且争着和贵宾们握手。
