    “Chinese Opera Costume Patterns”
    Recently, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House published a set of "Chinese Opera Costume Patterns." The complete set consists of seventy-three pictures, and the illustrations and printing are very exquisite. These patterns were compiled by art workers from the former Northeast Drama Research Institute, who copied many representative pattern materials from theatrical troupes and theatrical costume factories in Beijing, Shanghai, Northeast China, Fujian, Jiangsu and other places. The patterns not only have great utility in theatrical costume design, but can also be used for painting washbasins, porcelain, and printing floral fabrics and silks and satins and other industrial products.

    “中国戏曲服装图案”
    最近人民美术出版社出版了一套“中国戏曲服装图案”。全套画面共七十三幅，绘图印制非常精美。这是前东北戏剧研究院的美术工作者在北京、上海、东北、福建、江苏等地的剧团和戏剧服装工厂中，临摹了许多有代表性的图案资料编辑而成的。图案不但在戏剧服装设计上有着很大的使用价值，而且也有用于绘制面盆、瓷器及印制花布、绸缎等工业品。
