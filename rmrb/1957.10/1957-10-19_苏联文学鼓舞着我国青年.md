　　Soviet Literature Inspires Our Youth

　　Recently, some students from Beijing Experimental High School began preparing to hold a Soviet works appreciation meeting as a meaningful activity to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.
　　Soviet literary works are deeply loved by the vast number of young people in our country. Whether in public libraries and bookstores, or in dormitories of schools and enterprises, young people can be seen reading Soviet literary works with great eagerness. Many excellent Soviet works, after being translated into Chinese and published, immediately aroused the interest of young people. The publishing house repeatedly reprinted them, but the demand still could not be met. The People's Literature Publishing House and the China Youth Publishing House have published more than 270 Chinese translations of Soviet literary works in the past seven years. Books such as "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "The Story of Zoya and Shura" have sold more than one million copies. "The Young Guard," "Far from Moscow," and "The Seagull" have also been printed in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of copies. The Chinese translation of the novel "What Concerns Us Personally," which depicts the noble qualities of Soviet commercial workers, was reprinted four times within four months of its publication. Many middle schools in Beijing have designated books such as "An Ordinary Soldier—Matrosov" and "The Story of Zoya and Shura" as extracurricular reading materials. Youth League cadres and Young Pioneer instructors also regard these books as their work manuals. The librarian of Beijing Experimental High School told reporters that the school's nearly 2,000 students most like to read Soviet literary works. There are hundreds of copies of "A Real Man," "An Ordinary Soldier—Matrosov," etc., and they are often all checked out. The librarian pointed to some Soviet works on the shelf that had been rebound and said that these books are constantly circulating among the students, and the covers are worn out severely despite being repeatedly wrapped.
　　The protagonists of Soviet literary works have become role models for the vast number of young people to learn from.
　　There is a Zoya Class in Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School. The students in this class once wrote a letter to Zoya's mother, Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya, saying that they carefully read "The Story of Zoya and Shura," and the heroic deeds narrated in the book attracted, encouraged, and educated them, and they were determined to learn from Zoya and Shura. Among the students in the Zoya Class, there are fourteen Communist Youth League members and thirty-five Young Pioneers, and their academic performance is almost all above 90 points. In any school, similar examples of Soviet literature inspiring young people to move forward can be heard. Students from Hebei Beijing Middle School went camping in the Western Hills of Beijing's suburbs, and the entire camp was named the Matrosov Camp. Some students participated in climbing Black Head Mountain. Because the mountain was very steep and the weather was hot, everyone was extremely thirsty when they reached the top, but there was very little water brought, and each person could only drink half a small bowl. At that time, some students only took a sip and voluntarily gave the water to another younger student. During the "march," many students volunteered to carry the public shovels, ropes, and bags of steamed buns, regardless of fatigue. Later, at the summary meeting of the camping life, one student recited what Grandpa Makar said to Matrosov in "An Ordinary Soldier—Matrosov": "One should live in such a way that the lives of others will be better because of your existence."
　　Soviet literature has also become a motivating force for the production and work of young workers and staff. In the trade union library of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, there are often three or four hundred workers and staff going to read or borrow books. The young worker Yu Yongkang often reads Soviet novels. After reading "The Brave," when he encountered difficulties in his work, he used the heroic figures in the book to encourage himself, which increased his spirit of daring to overcome difficulties. A statistician in this factory was not at ease with his work. After reading "Here the Mornings Are Quiet," which was recommended by the library, he realized that all kinds of work are glorious and changed his past attitude towards work. They took the heroic figures in Soviet literature as examples and tempered themselves in work and production. Both of them later became socialist youth activists in the factory.
　　After the publication of "What Concerns Us Personally," it immediately became a "textbook" for commercial workers in Beijing to learn from. The Library of the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace also held a readers' symposium on this book. A salesperson from the Beijing Company of China Department Store talked about his feelings after reading it, saying: This book made me love commercial work, and I felt intimately that standing at the counter is not simply selling things, but directly affects production and people's lives; Lena Bai-Ava in the book is a role model for us to learn from.

### 苏联文学鼓舞着我国青年

　　苏联文学鼓舞着我国青年
　　新华社记者  孙世恺
    最近，北京实验中学的一些学生开始筹备举办苏联作品欣赏会，作为他们纪念十月革命四十周年的一项有意义的活动。
    苏联文学作品，受到我国广大青年的热爱。不论在公共图书馆和书店里，不论在学校和机关企业的宿舍里，都可看到青年们如饥似渴地阅读苏联文学作品。许多优秀的苏联作品，译成中文出版后，立即引起青年们的兴趣。出版社一再重版都供不应求。人民文学出版社和中国青年出版社等七年来共出版了二百七十多部苏联文学的中文译本。“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“卓娅和舒拉的故事”等书都销行了一百多万册。“青年近卫军”、“远离莫斯科的地方”、“海鸥”等也都印行十几万乃至近百万册。描写苏维埃商业工作者高贵品质的小说“我们切身的事业”中译本出版后四个月，就重印了四次。北京有许多中学都把“普通一兵——马特洛索夫”、“卓娅和舒拉的故事”等书定为课外的读物。青年团干部和少先队辅导员也把这些书当作自己的工作手册。北京实验中学图书馆的管理员对记者说，他们学校的近两千学生，最喜欢看的书是苏联文学作品。“真正的人”、“普通一兵——马特洛索夫”等都有上百本，也还往往是借阅一空。图书管理员指着书架上重新包过书皮的一些苏联作品说，这些书都是不停地在学生手中传阅，书皮是包了又包，还是磨损得很厉害。
    苏联文学作品的主人翁，成了广大青年学习的榜样。
    北京市第一女子中学有个卓娅班。这班学生有一次给卓娅的母亲留芭夫·柯斯莫捷绵斯卡亚写信说，她们仔细地阅读“卓娅和舒拉的故事”，书中所叙述的英雄事迹，吸引、鼓舞和教育了她们，决心向卓娅和舒拉学习。卓娅班的学生中，有十四个共青团员和三十五个少先队员，她们的学习成绩几乎全部都在九十分以上。在任何一个学校里，都能听到苏联文学鼓舞着青年们前进的类似的事例。河北北京中学的学生到北京郊区的西山去露营，全营被命名为马特洛索夫营。有些学生参加爬黑头山的活动时，由于山很陡，天又热，爬上山顶大家都口渴得要命，可是带去的水却很少，每人只能喝半小碗。当时有的学生只喝了一口就主动把水分给另一个年纪较小的同学。在“行军”途中，又有许多学生不顾劳累自愿背起公用的铲子、绳子和装馒头的口袋。后来，在露营生活的总结会上，一个学生背诵了“普通一兵——马特洛索夫”中马加尔爷爷向马特洛索夫说的那句话：“应当这样生活，要使别人的生活由于你的生存会更美好。”
    苏联文学也成为青年职工生产、工作的鼓动力量。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂的工会图书馆里，经常有三、四百职工去看书或借书。青年工人虞永康就常看苏联小说。他看过“勇敢”以后，当工作中遇到困难时，就以书中英雄人物来鼓励自己，增加了勇于克服困难的精神。这个厂有个统计员不安心工作，看了图书馆推荐的“我们这里已是早晨”，认识到各样工作都是光荣的，改变了过去的工作态度。他们以苏联文学中的英雄人物作榜样，在工作和生产中锻炼自己，这两个人后来都成为工厂里的社会主义青年积极分子。
    “我们切身的事业”一书出版后，立即成为北京商业工作人员学习的“教科书”。北京市劳动人民文化宫图书馆还举行过这本书的读者座谈会。中国百货公司北京市公司有个售货员谈到他读后的感想说：这本书使我热爱上商业工作，亲切地感到站柜台不是简单地卖卖东西，而是直接影响着生产和人民的生活；书中的列娜·白阿娃是我们学习的榜样。
