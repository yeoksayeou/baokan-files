    Who Killed Cock Robin

    “Who killed Cock Robin?” This is a nursery rhyme that every American elementary and middle school student can sing. However, now that millions of elementary and middle school students are crowding into cramped, dilapidated, and poorly equipped classrooms this autumn after the start of the school year, it seems they should change the song title to: “Who Killed the School Construction Bill?” Because, at the first session of the Eighty-fifth United States Congress that adjourned a few days before their school started, a bill requesting the federal government to allocate 1.5 billion US dollars for school building construction over the next five years was rejected.
    Why was this school bill rejected by Congress? Was there no need? Was there no money? Neither.
    Speaking of the need, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his special message on the state of U.S. schools at the end of January this year, acknowledged that the lack of schools has been a “very acute” problem for “many years.” Currently, the number of students studying in American municipal schools exceeds the number of students that existing school buildings can normally accommodate by 2.5 million. A survey report by the U.S. “National Education Association” shows that the United States is short of more than 159,000 classrooms this year, and 79,000 dilapidated school buildings are in urgent need of replacement. In New York, the largest city in the United States, some schools are so dilapidated that the Mayor of New York had to admit that they are “a disgrace to New York City.”
    Speaking of money, it is not a difficult thing for the United States, which can spend tens of billions of dollars a year on military spending, to allocate a mere 300 million dollars a year.
    Given the need and the money, it would seem that passing a school bill urgently demanded by the American people should be a matter of course and not require much effort.
    In fact, both parties in Congress have repeatedly promised to subsidize school construction by the federal government. However, the “democracy” of the two-party system in the United States is indeed infinitely mysterious. After a “democratic” discussion in the House of Representatives, this school bill shrank from large to small, and from small to nothing, like a piece of ice in summer!
    This mysterious “democracy” has three movements:
    First movement—In order to show that it was “keeping its campaign promises,” the Republican Eisenhower administration proposed a bill to subsidize school construction by the federal government at the beginning of this year’s Congress. Eisenhower himself delivered a radio address to the nation, touting the Republican Party’s determination to “seek benefits for the people” on this issue. The Democratic Party, which controlled Congress, naturally did not want to be outdone in terms of “keeping its promises,” and not only “supported” this bill, but also showed that it was even more “seeking benefits for the people” than the Republican Party, expanding the Republican Party’s original bill of subsidizing 1.3 billion US dollars within four years to subsidizing 3.6 billion US dollars within six years.
    Second movement—After both sides boasted for a while, according to the rules of procedure of Congress, the bill was handed over to a committee of the House of Representatives, where it was shelved for several months. During this period, Eisenhower was busy playing golf and actively advocating aggressive “aid” to foreign countries, while there was no news about the construction of schools. Under the urging of the people at home, the leaders of the two parties in the House of Representatives lazily followed the usual practice of seeking a “compromise” between the proposals put forward by the Republican and Democratic parties respectively, in order to submit it to the plenary session of the House of Representatives for discussion. Since it is called a “compromise,” it would normally be expected that the amount of subsidy should be between 325 million and 600 million US dollars per year on average, but this time, the result of the “compromise” was only 300 million US dollars per year on average!
    Third movement—Although the two parties reached a “compromise,” in fact, neither party really wanted to pass the bill in Congress. They were focused solely on winning more votes for themselves in next year’s midterm congressional elections. Therefore, when the school bill was submitted to the House of Representatives for a vote, the question was no longer whether the bill could be passed, but, as the U.S. “Newsweek” said, how to make the other party be seen by the voters as responsible for the rejection of the school construction bill when the bill was definitely not going to pass.
    Outside the parliament, the Democratic Party released information that Eisenhower was not enthusiastic about the school bill, and that the bill was in danger of not being passed, in order to preemptively absolve the Democratic Party of responsibility. Eisenhower authorized the Republican leader in the House of Representatives to declare that he was “not entirely satisfied” with the school bill amended by the Democratic Party, thereby signaling that Republican members of the House of Representatives could vote against the bill, while shifting the responsibility back to the Democratic Party. Inside the parliament, a Republican member deliberately proposed an amendment stipulating that schools that practice racial segregation should not receive federal subsidies, thereby arousing the opposition of Southern Democrats, so as to make it easier to shift the responsibility to the Democratic Party; while a Democratic member suggested passing the original bill (that is, subsidies could be received regardless of whether racial segregation was practiced or not), with the aim of putting the Republican Party in a dilemma: if it agreed, it would be suspected of agreeing to racial segregation, and if it opposed, it would have to bear the responsibility for destroying the school bill.
    As a result, most Republican members and some Northern Democratic members voted against the original bill in order to gain political capital on the issue of civil rights legislation in the future (at that time, the civil rights legislation had not yet been put on the agenda), and the demand of the people of the United States for many years—hoping that the federal government would build more schools for their children—was completely in vain.
    “Who killed the School Construction Bill?”
    The Democratic Party said: It wasn’t me, 57% of the Democratic members voted in favor. The 111 Republican members who voted against played a decisive role in the destruction.
    The Republican Party said: It wasn’t me, it was the Southern Democrats who insisted on racial segregation that prevented the school bill from being passed.
    Eisenhower said: It wasn’t me either, I have already given several speeches for this bill, and I have expressed “great disappointment” with the House of Representatives’ failure to pass this bill.
    Indeed, it can also be said that it was not them. Republican Representative Wainwright said something very brilliant in the debate in the House of Representatives: “Because the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce oppose federal subsidies for education, it has caused a lot of gossip. We (those who oppose the school bill)...are accused of being tools of these powerful corporate organizations. This is ridiculous.” The last sentence of this Congressman, “This is ridiculous,” is like “Here lies three hundred taels of silver.” In fact, he really revealed who killed the school bill.

    谁杀死了知更雀
    施旅
    “谁杀死了知更雀？”这是美国的中小学生人人会唱的一首童谣；而在今年秋季开学后，当数以百万计的中小学生拥挤在狭窄的、破烂的、设备粗陋的教室里的时候，看来他们应该替这首童谣换个歌题了：“谁杀死了修建学校法案？”因为，就在他们开学前几天闭会的美国第八十五届国会第一期会议上，一项要求联邦政府在今后五年内拨付十五亿美元修建学校房屋的法案被否决了。
    为什么这项学校法案会被国会否决呢？是没有需要吗？是没有钱吗？都不是。
    说到需要，美国总统艾森豪威尔在今年1月底提出的关于美国学校情况的特别咨文中就承认：学校不够是一个“许多年来”一直“十分尖锐”的问题，目前在美国市立学校里学习的人数比现有学校校舍在正常情况下所能容纳的人数多了二百五十万人。美国“全国教育协会”的一个调查报告表明，美国今年缺少教室十五万九千多间，原有七万九千间破旧不堪的校舍急待更换。在纽约这个美国最大的城市里，有些学校也如此破烂，以至纽约市长都不得不承认是“纽约市的耻辱”。
    说到钱，对于一年能以数百亿美元作为备战军费的美国，每年拿出区区三亿美元，是算不得什么困难的。
    既有需要，又有钱，这样说来，要在国会通过一个美国人民迫切要求的学校法案，应该是“水到渠成”，不费多大周折的事了。
    事实上，国会两党的确也是都一再许诺要由联邦政府补助修建校舍的。然而，两党制的美国“民主”毕竟奥妙无穷，经过在众议院的一番“民主”讨论之后，这个学校法案竟然像夏天的冰块似地由大化小，由小化无了！
    这一奥妙的“民主”，是有三部曲的：
    第一部——为了表示“信守竞选诺言”，共和党的艾森豪威尔政府在今年国会开幕之初，提出了由联邦政府补助修建学校的法案，艾森豪威尔亲自向全国发表广播演说，鼓吹共和党在这个问题上“为民谋利”的决心。控制了国会的民主党在“信守诺言”方面自然不甘落后，不但“支持”这一法案，而且表现得比共和党更加“为民谋利”，把共和党原法案规定的四年之内补助十三亿美元扩大为六年之内补助三十六亿美元。
    第二部——在双方都大吹大擂了一阵之后，按照国会议事规程，这项法案被交给了众议院的一个委员会，在那里一压就是好几个月。在这期间，艾森豪威尔忙于打高尔夫球和积极鼓吹侵略性的“援”外法案，而修建学校的事情却毫无音信。在国内人民的催促之下，众议院的两党领袖才懒洋洋地按惯例在共和党和民主党分别提出的方案之间寻取“折衷”，以便交付众议院全体会议讨论。既然名为“折衷”，按常理说来，补助的数目应该是每年平均三亿二千五百万美元到六亿美元之间，可是这一回，“折衷”的结果却是平均每年只有三亿美元了！
    第三部——虽然两党取得了“折衷”，实际上没有一个党真正想在国会里通过这个法案。他们着眼的只是在明年的国会中期选举中为自己争取更多的选票。因此，当学校法案提付众议院表决的时候，问题已不是这项法案能不能被通过，而是，如美国“新闻周刊”所说的，在法案肯定地通不过的时候，怎样使对方在选民的眼中被认为应该承担修建学校法案被否决的责任。
    在议会外，民主党放出空气说，艾森豪威尔对学校法案太不热心，这项法案有难以通过之虞，这样来为民主党事先摆脱责任；艾森豪威尔则授权众议院共和党领袖宣布，对被民主党修正过的学校法案“不完全满意”，借此示意共和党众议员可以投票反对此法案，同时把责任推回给民主党。在议会内，共和党一议员故意提出一项修正案，规定凡执行种族隔离的学校就不能得到联邦的补助，借此来引起南方民主党人的反对，便于把责任推到民主党身上；而民主党一议员则建议通过原来的法案（即不问执行种族隔离与否都可受补助），目的是使共和党处于两难境地：如赞成，就有同意种族隔离之嫌，如反对，就须承担破坏学校法案的责任。
    结果，大部分共和党议员和一部分北方民主党议员为了便于在日后的公民权利法案问题上捞取政治资本（当时公民权利法案尚未提到议程上），投票反对原来的法案，美国各州人民多年来的要求——希望联邦政府为他们的子女多盖些学校——就完全落空了。
    “谁杀死了修建学校法案？”
    民主党说：不是我，57％的民主党议员是投赞成票的。一百十一名共和党议员投反对票，这才起了决定性的破坏作用。
    共和党说：不是我，是南方民主党人坚持种族隔离，这才使学校法案不能通过的。
    艾森豪威尔说：也不是我，我已经为这项法案发表了好几篇演说，而且我已经对众议院的不能通过这项法案表示了“大大失望”。
    的确，也可以说都不是他们。共和党众议员温赖特在众议院的辩论中曾经说过一段非常精彩的话，他说：“由于全国制造商协会和美国商会反对联邦补助教育事业，已经引起了不少闲话。我们这些（反对学校法案的）人……被指责是这些强大的企业组织的工具。这是可笑的。”这位议员先生最后的“这是可笑的”一句话，未免像“此地无银三百两”。实际上，他倒是真正道破了杀死学校法案的是谁。
