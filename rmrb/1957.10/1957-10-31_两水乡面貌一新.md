    The New Look of Liangshui Township
    By Our Reporter, Gu Weijin

    After breakfast, we arrived at Liangshui Township. This is the key township for the CCP Sui County Committee's work, and the earliest in the county to carry out socialist education. We originally intended to ask some cadres to introduce their experiences in carrying out socialist education here, but unexpectedly they were enthusiastically talking about how socialist education had become the driving force for promoting all work, and how the entire township had begun to take on a new look.

    Smooth Progress in Financial and Economic Work
    "This year's work is completely different from last year's," said Yu Wengui, the head of Liangshui Township. "Last year was a bumper harvest year, but it was difficult to promote work. This year is also a bumper harvest year, but after a period of socialist education, the work is much smoother." Yu Wengui is responsible for the township's financial and economic work and talked about the situation: "Take the Lianmeng Cooperative as an example, the deputy director Zhou Yongwan used to have a very serious parochialism. He only knew how to leave more grain for the cooperative members and distribute more money so that the work would be easier. He didn't care about the interests of the country at all. This time, at the debate meeting of all the cooperative captains and above in the township, everyone calculated the accounts of the country's support for the cooperative and the cooperative's increased production. Zhou Yongwan's mind became clear. This year, the grain purchase task of the Lianmeng Cooperative is 310,000 jin. He originally planned to complete only 260,000 jin, but now he has not only completed the task but also sold an additional 110,000 jin of surplus grain. The cooperative once owed the state a loan of 15,000 yuan, which was overdue for one or two years without repayment, but now the loan has been fully repaid. His actions educated the cooperative members to cherish the interests of the country. Since 1952, the cooperative members have owed banks and credit cooperatives more than 7,000 yuan in loans, which had not been repaid. This time, more than 3,000 yuan has been repaid, and it is planned to repay all of it this year; last year, more than 70 yuan of government bonds could not be sold and were purchased by the cooperative with垫钱 (diànqián - advance money), but this time the cooperative members not only automatically bought these more than 70 yuan of government bonds, but also overfulfilled this year's government bond task and deposited more than 3,000 yuan in the credit cooperative." Speaking of this, a smile appeared on Yu Wengui's dark face. He said that the Lianmeng Cooperative was the most difficult to deal with in the township, but this time it was completely transformed, and it was naturally not a problem for the other cooperatives to complete their tasks. "Last year, we wore out our shoes and offended people. By the end of the lunar year, the financial tasks had not been completed. This year, from September to now, in just over half a month, all the financial tasks have been overfulfilled." He glanced at us and asked us to patiently listen to some of the figures below: Last year, the grain purchase task of the whole township was 3,130,000 jin, but only 2,980,000 jin was completed by the end of the lunar year, and the remaining more than 100,000 jin was barely completed until February this year; this year, the grain purchase task of the whole township is 3,650,000 jin, and the amount in storage now reaches 3,740,000 jin, and the estimated amount in storage will reach 4,250,000 jin, an overfulfillment of 600,000 jin. Last year's bank loan was 53,300 yuan, and only 14,000 yuan was recovered by December; this year's bank loan is 40,710 yuan, and the plan is to recover 27,500 yuan, but now the amount of loan repaid by the masses voluntarily reaches 30,585 yuan, and it is estimated that 35,000 yuan can be recovered by the end of the year. Last year's advance payment for grain, cotton, and oil was 14,600 yuan, and 700 yuan was still owed by the end of the lunar year, which was only recovered in the summer of this year. This year's advance payment for grain, cotton, and oil is 18,721 yuan, and it has now been fully recovered. In addition, the purchase of cotton and oilseeds and the sale of government bonds have all overfulfilled the tasks; the supply and marketing cooperative's loans for production materials, credit cooperative loans, and water conservancy construction fees have all been recovered ahead of schedule.

        Cadres Retreat and Then Advance
    Yu Wengui spoke to this point and the cadres began to talk more. Some people talked about: Not long ago, more than 30 cadres above the team leader level and party members in the township had thoughts of retreating, but now after socialist education, they not only do not retreat, but also expressed their determination to continue to the end. Xiao Chengzhe, the director of the Lianmeng Cooperative, a young man with a flushed face, first talked about Wang Haiyuan (a party member), the captain of their fifth production team: This veteran had turned the production team into a business team:贩卖牛肉、鸡蛋、熬糖、推板车……(fànmài niúròu, jīdàn, áotáng, tuībǎichē... – selling beef, eggs, boiling sugar, pushing carts… ) Production decreased and he clamored to resign and do business – open a cotton gin. This time, after everyone debated his capitalist ideas, he realized that he was in danger of “falling into a big pit,” and turned back in time, handing over his cotton gin, fishing nets, etc. to the cooperative at a discounted price, and his attitude towards production also changed: In the past, he had “four nots” for doing work – he wouldn't do heavy work, he wouldn't do work with low points, he wouldn't do work in the morning (because of the dew), and he wouldn't do work when the sun was too hot – now, in order to fight drought and winter sowing, he leads the cooperative members to water, plow the fields, and collect manure day and night… Speaking of this, Xiao Chengzhe's eyes gleamed with excitement, and he talked about Li Chengjiang who overcame his retreatist thinking in their cooperative: “He is the captain (party member) of the first production team. He used to be a hired laborer and a beggar. In the early days of liberation, he was still active in his work. In the past two years, seeing that the cooperative members were good at giving opinions to the cadres and the work was not easy to do, and thinking that he had enough to eat and wear, why should he be angry as a cadre? So he firmly proposed to resign. In this great debate, his thinking underwent a struggle: “Was it better to be a hired laborer in the past, or is it better to be a cadre now?” Later, he realized that “being a hired laborer is a slave, being a cadre is to serve the people.” He didn't propose to resign, and said: “There are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. I used to think that the work was not easy to do, that was a problem of thinking.” Now, in the drought resistance and winter planting, he leads the water car during the day and leads the delivery of manure at night, with his buttocks worn out and his eyes bloodshot, without any complaints.”

    Changing Work Style and Improving Work
    After Xiao Chengzhe finished speaking, Old Liu, a staff member who had settled in this township for nearly two years, changed the topic again. They said that this socialist education has also effectively promoted cadres to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and improve their work style. They talked about Zhang Huading, the director of Xinchun Cooperative, who is representative: "He has always been unwilling to listen to the opinions of the masses. He was the only one who had the say in the big and small affairs of the cooperative. Now that he has heard some committee members reflect that 'they have power without authority under his leadership' and the cooperative members reflect 'subjective arrangements,' he felt that something was wrong and reviewed: 'In the past, I didn't let go of things because I was afraid that people would mess things up. In fact, the cooperative is so big, how can things be done well by relying on one person?' Now he discusses everything, big or small, with the masses. Recently, he submitted the purchase of a ten-row seeder and the formulation of water-carrying work points for drought resistance and winter planting to the management committee for discussion." They paused and talked about how the transformation of the cadres' work style had promoted the masses to put forward many rationalization proposals, and work is now being improved based on these proposals. For example, in the past, some cooperatives had unreasonable advances: those who were eloquent could get advances, while those who were truly hardworking and honest could not, resulting in many overspending households, and the masses had many complaints. Now, according to the suggestions of the masses, pre-advances are implemented based on labor (about once every one or two months), and everyone is very satisfied, and the enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved. In the past, some cooperatives did not pay much attention to supporting poor households (caused by large families, natural disasters, etc.), and some people even thought that supporting poor households was not as good as buying a few more cows. Now they have criticized this view and, according to everyone's opinions, have made a plan to support the rise of poor households and make comprehensive arrangements. In addition, according to the suggestions of the masses, some necessary systems have also been established: 1. Under the leadership of the party branch, a seven-member propaganda and education committee is organized with the deputy secretary as the head, and each cooperative branch organizes a propaganda and education group with the secretary as the head, specializing in managing the political and ideological education of party members and cadres throughout the township, and holding party classes once a month in units of branches; 2. Each production team absorbs old farmers as consultants to participate in team meetings; 3. Major issues in the cooperative, such as distribution, planning, three guarantees, production plans, and major technological reforms, must be discussed through the members' representative meeting, and a regular three-person symposium system is established at the same time; 4. All party members and cadres in the township each manage one or two mu of experimental fields to improve technology and guide production.

          New Production Upsurge
    The next day of the visit, listening to some cooperative members talk about the township after socialist education, a new production upsurge is being set off – a large-scale drought resistance and winter planting movement.

    This year, the winter planting area of ​​this township is more than 22,000 mu, of which 95% of the area needs drought resistance and winter planting. This task is very arduous, but no one is willing to bow their heads in the face of drought. Here and there, regardless of men, women, old or young, everyone is busy with watering, carrying water, sending manure, tidying fields, and sowing seeds, sometimes working until late at night. Throughout the township, except for the sick and pregnant women, the attendance rate has risen from more than 90% in normal times to 100%. Some old farmers talked about this year's drought resistance and winter planting, and said very movingly: "This year, we have been fighting drought from rice transplanting to autumn harvest, and now we have to fight drought for winter planting, and the drought resistance area is almost the entire winter planting area. This was impossible in the past. Historically, there was a habit of fighting drought to save苞 (bāo – bud) (that is, rice buds), but there was no habit of fighting drought for winter planting. However, this year's socialist education has changed historical habits."

    Although the task of drought resistance and winter planting is so arduous, people have not relaxed their efforts to improve winter planting technology, and have even greatly strengthened it compared with last year's winter planting technology, when the drought was very small. Last year, the land was tilled with one plow and one harrow or two plows and two harrows, but this year, all land is tilled with three plows and three harrows; last year, wheat strip planting accounted for 60% (the remaining 40% was broadcast), but this year, all wheat is strip planted (of which more than 500 mu are promoting the Soviet Union's advanced experience of wide-row strip planting); last year, the proportion of sowing seeds directly without fertilizer 下田 (xiàtián – to the fields) accounted for 25% of the winter planting area, but this year the proportion of sowing seeds directly without fertilizer 下田 (xiàtián – to the fields) accounts for less than 5%. In addition, in order to resolve the contradiction between rice and wheat planting, winter planting is advanced by half a month. In order to ensure full seedlings, it is required that no planting is done without moisture.

    两水乡面貌一新
    本报记者　古维进
    吃过早饭，我们来到两水乡。这是中共随县县委的工作重点乡，全县的社会主义教育以这里为最早。我们本来想请一些干部介绍这里开展社会主义教育的经验，没想到他们兴致勃勃地忙着谈起社会主义教育怎样成为推动一切工作的动力，全乡面貌开始一新的情况来。
    财经工作顺利开展
    “去年和今年，工作完全不一样。”两水乡乡长余文贵说，“去年是丰收年，可是工作不好推动，今年也是丰收年，可是搞了一段社会主义教育，工作顺当得多了。”余文贵是负责全乡财经工作的，谈起了财经工作情形：“就说联盟社吧，副主任周永万原来的本位主义思想很严重，只知道给社员多留些粮，多分些钱，工作就好干些。国家的利益根本不管。这次在全乡十个社队长以上的辩论会上，大家给他算了算国家对合作社的扶持账，和合作社的增产账，周永万的脑子清醒了。今年联盟社的粮食征购任务三十一万斤，他原来打算只完成二十六万斤，现在不仅全部完成任务，还多售余粮十一万斤。社里曾经欠国家贷款一万五千元，过期一二年之久都不归还，现在贷款全部还清了。他的行动教育了社员爱护国家利益。从1952年以来，社员欠银行和信用社贷款七千多元，没有归还，这次还了三千多元，准备今年全部还清；去年有七十多元公债销不出去，由社垫钱购买，这次社员不仅自动把这七十多元公债买掉，还超额完成今年的公债任务，并在信用社存了三千多元。”说到这里，余文贵微黑的脸孔浮起了笑容。他说，全乡十个社要算联盟社最不好打交道，可是这一次完全转变了，其他的社完成任务自然更不成问题。”“去年我们跑破鞋子，得罪了人，直到阴历年底，各项财经任务都没有完成，今年呢，从9月间到现在，只半个多月时间，各项财经任务都超额完成。”他瞟了我们一眼，要求我们耐心的听一听下面的一些数目字：去年全乡的粮食征购任务三百一十三万斤，阴历年底才完成了二百九十八万斤，剩下十多万斤到今年2月才勉强完成；今年全乡的粮食征购任务三百六十五万斤，现在入库的达三百七十四万斤，预计入库的要达四百二十五万斤，可超额完成任务六十万斤。去年的银行贷款五万三千三百元，到12月才收回一万四千元；今年的银行贷款四万零七百一十元，计划收回二万七千五百元，但现在群众自动还贷款的达三万零五百八十五元，预计年底可收回贷款三万五千元。去年的粮棉油预购款一万四千六百元，收到阴历年底，尚欠七百元，今年夏季才收回，今年的粮棉油预购款一万八千七百二十一元，现在已经全部收回。此外，棉花、油料的征购，公债的推销，都超额完成任务；生产资料赊销款，信用社贷款，水利建设费等都比预定时间提前收回。
        干部退坡又上坡
    余文贵说到这里，干部们的话多起来了。有些人谈起：不久以前，乡里有队长以上干部和党团员三十余人存在退坡思想，现在经过社会主义教育，不仅不退坡，还表示坚决干到底。联盟社主任萧成泽，一个脸孔红扑扑的青年，首先谈到他们第五生产队队长王海元（党员）：这个转业军人曾经把生产队搞成生意队：贩卖牛肉、鸡蛋、熬糖、推板车……生产搞得减了产，还吵吵闹闹的要求退职去做生意——开弹花店。这次大家和他的资本主义思想展开辩论后，他认识到自己有“掉到大坑”的危险，猛省回头，把自己的弹花机，鱼网等都折价交社，生产态度也改变了：以前他做活有“四不干”——重活不干，分少的活不干，早晨不干（因为有露水），太阳太大不干——，现在为了抗旱冬播，他日日夜夜的领导社员车水、犁田、捡粪……说到这里。萧成泽的眼睛闪着兴奋的光彩，又谈到他们社里克服退坡思想的李成江：“他是第一生产队队长（党员），过去当过长工、要过饭，翻身初期，工作还积极，这两年看见社员好给干部提意见，工作不好搞，又想到自己有吃有穿何必当干部呕气？便坚决提出辞职不干。这次大辩论中，他的思想起了斗争：“是过去当长工好呢？还是现在当干部好呢？”后来认识到“当长工是奴隶，当干部是为人民服务”他不提出辞职了，并说：“没有克服不了的困难，以前认为工作不好搞，那是思想问题。”现在他在抗旱冬播中，白天领导车水，晚上领导送粪，屁股磨破，眼睛熬红，没有一点意见。”
    转变作风，改进工作
    萧成泽说完，在这个乡落户将近两年的工作人员老刘等，又转换了话题。他们说，这一次的社会主义教育，还有效地推动干部虚心听取群众的意见，改进工作作风。他们谈到有代表性的新春社主任张华顶说：“他一贯不愿意听取群众的意见，社里大小事情，只有他一个人说话算事。现在他听到一些社委反映‘在他的领导下有职无权’和社员反映‘主观包办’，他感到不对头了，检讨说：‘从前做事不放手，是怕人把事情搞坏，其实社这么大，光靠一个人，那能把事情办好？’现在社里大小事情，他都和群众商量。最近社里购买十行播种机和制定抗旱冬播的车水工分等，他都提到管理委员会讨论。”他们顿了顿，又谈到由于干部工作作风的转变，推动群众提出许多合理化建议，现在正在根据这些建议改进工作。例如，过去有些社借支不合理：能说会道的可以借支到钱，真正勤劳的老实人借支不到钱，结果出现许多超支户，群众的意见很大。现在根据群众的建议，实行按劳预支（约一二个月预支一次），大家都很满意，生产积极性大大提高。过去有些社对于贫困户（他们由于家大口阔，天灾人祸等造成的）的扶持很不重视，有些人甚至认为扶持贫困户不如多买几条牛。现在他们批判了这种说法，根据大家的意见，作出扶持贫困户上升的规划，进行全面安排。此外，根据群众的建议，还定出一些必要的制度：一、在党总支领导下，以副书记为首组织七人宣教委员会，各社分支以书记为首组织宣教小组，专门管理全乡党团员和干部的政治思想教育，每月以分支为单位上党课一次；二、每个生产队都吸收老农为顾问，参加队务会议；三、社内的重大问题如分配、规划、三包、生产计划、大的技术改革等，必须通过社员代表会讨论，同时建立经常性的三种人座谈会制度；四、全乡所有党团员和干部每人搞一二亩试验田，以提高技术，指导生产。
          新的生产高潮
    访问的第二天，听一些社员谈到这个乡在社会主义教育之后，正在掀起一个新的生产高潮——规模巨大的抗旱冬播运动。
    今年这个乡的冬播面积有二万二千多亩，其中有95％的面积需要抗旱冬播。这个任务很繁重，但是，没有一个人愿意在旱象面前低头。这里那里，不分男女老少，都在忙着车水、挑水、送粪、整田、播种，有时一直干到晚上。全乡除了病人和孕妇外，出勤率由平时90％以上上升到100％。一些老农谈起今年的抗旱冬播，非常感动的说：“今年我们从栽秧一直抗旱到秋收，现在冬播又要抗旱，而且抗旱面积几乎是冬播面积的全部，这在往年，根本不可能。这里历史上有抗旱救苞（即稻谷打的苞）习惯，没有抗旱冬播习惯。可是，今年的社会主义教育改变了历史习惯。”
    尽管抗旱冬播任务这样繁重，但是人们对于冬播技术的改进并没有放松，甚至比旱灾很小的去年的冬播技术还要大大加强。去年整田是一犁一耙或二犁二耙，今年一律三犁三耙；去年小麦条播占60％（其余40％撒播），今年小麦全部条播（其中有五百多亩推广苏联先进经验实行宽幅条播）；去年白子下田（即不施底肥下种）占冬播面积25％，今年白子下田占冬播面积不到5％。此外，为了解决稻麦种植的矛盾，提前半个月冬播，为了保证全苗，一律做到无墒不播种。
