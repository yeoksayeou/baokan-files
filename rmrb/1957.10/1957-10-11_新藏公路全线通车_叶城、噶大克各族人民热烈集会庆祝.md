    The Entire Xinjiang-Tibet Highway Opens to Traffic
    People of All Ethnic Groups in Yecheng and Gadaq Gather Enthusiastically to Celebrate

    (Our newspaper's Yecheng dispatch, October 10th, by reporter Zhan Ping from the People's Highway News) The entire Xinjiang-Tibet Highway has officially opened to traffic. People of all ethnic groups in Yecheng County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and Gadaq in the Ali region of Tibet, recently held celebration rallies separately.

    On the 9th, people of all ethnic groups and circles in Yecheng held a celebration rally at the People's Square. Colorful flags and huge banners decorated the square extraordinarily beautifully, and the entire Yecheng was filled with a festive atmosphere. The fraternal ethnic groups in Yecheng Township were like celebrating the Corban Festival, with joyful crowds everywhere. Uygur girls from twenty or thirty miles away also rode donkeys to attend the rally. More than twenty units and 6,800 people participated in the celebration rally. Sima Yi, Deputy Commissioner of the Kashgar Administrative Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the Kashgar Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Administrative Office. He said, "The opening of the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway is another great victory of our country's first Five-Year Plan, and it is also a great happy event for the people of the whole country, especially the people of Xinjiang and Tibet. This fully embodies the care of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for the fraternal ethnic groups." In his speech, he pointed out that in the old society, in the era when reactionary rulers were in power, it would have been impossible to build this highway. Only today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, can this huge project be completed. The rightists clamored that "the Communist Party is not leading well," which is completely nonsense. Colonel Tan Yonghua, representative of the Xinjiang Military Region, Han Guodong, Director of the Highway Bureau of the Xinjiang Communications Department, and He Lianhao, Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway Construction Command, also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously pointed out that the completion of the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway is of great significance for promoting the development of political, economic and cultural undertakings in Xinjiang and Tibet, and further strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups. They also presented four silk banners to all the staff and workers who built the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway.

    People of all ethnic groups in Gadaq held a celebration rally on the 6th. In addition to the local party, government, and military officials, some local headmen also attended the meeting. Wei Shanqi, Secretary of the Ali Sub-Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Luo Tong Caiwang, Director of the Ali Jiquo Office, and Cai Dan Dunzhu, Deputy Director, all attended the meeting to express their congratulations. Xu Luqing, Deputy Director of the Fifth Engineering Bureau and Commander of the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway Construction Command, also rushed from the construction site to Gadaq to participate in the celebration rally.

　　新藏公路全线通车
    叶城、噶大克各族人民热烈集会庆祝
    本报叶城10日电　人民公路报记者战萍报道：新藏公路全线已经正式通车。新疆维吾尔自治区叶城县和西藏阿里地区噶大克各族人民，最近分别举行了庆祝大会。
    9日，叶城各族各界人民在人民广场举行庆祝大会。五彩缤纷的彩旗和巨幅标语把广场装饰得格外美丽，整个叶城也是一片节日气象。叶城镇的兄弟民族像过库尔班节一样，到处都是欢天喜地的人群。二、三十里以外的维吾尔族的姑娘们也骑着毛驴赶来参加大会。参加庆祝大会的有二十多个单位，六千八百多人。新疆维吾尔自治区喀什专署副专员司马衣代表中共喀什地委和专署在会上讲话。他说：“新藏公路的通车是我国第一个五年计划的又一伟大胜利，也是全国人民首先是新疆与西藏人民的一件大喜事，这充分体现了共产党和毛主席对兄弟民族的关怀。”他在讲话中指出，在旧社会，在反动统治者当权的时代，要想修通这条公路，是不可能的，只有今天，在中国共产党的领导下，才能完成这一巨大工程。右派分子叫嚣说“共产党领导的不好”，这完全是胡说。在会上讲话的还有新疆军区代表谭永华大校，新疆交通厅公路局局长韩国栋及新藏公路修建指挥所副指挥贺连豪等。他们一致指出，新藏公路的建成，对于促进新疆和西藏政治、经济和文化事业的发展，进一步加强各族人民的团结具有重大的意义。他们并把四面锦旗赠给修筑新藏公路的全体职工。
