    Between Bowing and Raising Our Heads
    Yi Huai
    Chairman Mao saw many big-character posters criticizing leading cadres at the Shanghai State No. 1 Cotton Factory. He immediately asked the Party Committee Secretary and the Factory Director with great concern: "Have the cadres who were criticized raised their heads now?" This means that those who have been criticized should raise their heads!
    However, we also often say that after being criticized, we should bow our heads and admit our mistakes.
    This seems contradictory: is it better for those who have been criticized to raise their heads or to bow their heads?
    In fact, there is no contradiction. We must both raise our heads and bow our heads; the order should be to bow our heads first and then raise our heads.
    When we make mistakes and are criticized, we must first bow our heads to admit our mistakes, admit that we are sick, and then we can honestly seek medical treatment and take medicine. If we do not bow our heads to admit that we are sick and avoid seeking medical attention, it is impossible to cure the disease. It is extremely dangerous to have a disease and not treat it, so after being criticized, we must first bow our heads.
    After bowing our heads, we must raise our heads again. People who have made mistakes should improve their work and do it better after correcting their mistakes. At this time, we need to raise our heads, be full of vigor, and confidently undertake the tasks assigned by the Party. No one never makes mistakes. Many comrades can do good work after making mistakes because they have been criticized, admitted their mistakes, and have not lost their confidence in moving forward. Instead, they learn from their mistakes and gain more experience, which gives them more courage to move forward.
    If a person cannot raise his head after admitting his mistake, then there is a problem. This kind of bowing cannot be regarded as admitting the mistake, but rather as being afraid of losing face, being ashamed to face others, or being afraid of making mistakes again, and thus being dejected and losing confidence. At this time, even if his original illness has been cured and his body is no longer sick, he is by no means a healthy person, and he cannot engage in work like a healthy person. This situation is very worthy of attention by those who make mistakes and are criticized: after making a mistake, it is not only necessary to admit the mistake, but also to correct the mistake; it is not only necessary to correct the mistake, but also to pay close attention to eliminating the negative and gloomy emotions caused by it, and to bravely raise your head and engage in work with full confidence. This situation is also worthy of attention by critics and leaders. For those who make mistakes, we must criticize them severely and never compromise; but after they have admitted their mistakes, we must give them encouragement and support, help them change their negative emotions, and enable them to raise their heads and work actively. Just like a responsible doctor, he uses acupuncture and moxibustion severely during treatment, not afraid of causing pain to the patient, and after the illness is cured, he will take care of and recuperate the patient with all his heart to ensure that the patient recovers quickly.
    It is in this seemingly contradictory bowing and raising of heads that we fully embody our positive attitude of using the weapon of criticism to treat diseases and save people, as well as the positive attitude of those who are criticized towards criticism!

    低头与抬头之间
    易槐
    毛主席在上海国棉一厂看到了不少批评领导干部的大字报。他立刻很关心地问党委书记和厂长：“受到批评的干部现在是不是已抬起了头来？”这就是说，受了批评的人应该抬起头来！
    可是，我们又常常说，受了批评之后，应该低头认错。
    这样看来似乎有了矛盾：受了批评的人是抬头好呢还是低头好？
    其实，并不矛盾。既要抬头，又要低头；顺序应该是先低头，再抬头。
    犯了错误，受了批评，首先要低下头来承认错误，承认自己有病，然后才能老老实实地就医服药。不低头承认自己有病，讳疾忌医，当然不可能治病。有病而不治，这是万分危险的事，所以说，受了批评之后，必得先低下头来。
    低头之后一定还要再抬起头来。犯了错误的人改正了错误以后，就应该改进工作，把工作作得更好。这时候，就需要抬起头来，朝气勃勃满怀信心地来承担党所交付给的任务。没有从来不犯错误的人，许多同志犯了错误之后还能做好工作，就是因为他们受了批评，承认错误之后，并没有失掉前进的信心，反而吃一堑长一智，多一次教训，也就多一分前进的勇气。
    一个人在承认错误之后如果抬不起头来，那就有了问题。这种低头不能算是承认错误，而是怕失掉面子，见不得人，或者是怕再犯错误，因而垂头丧气失掉信心。这时候，纵然他原来的病已经痊愈，他的肌体已经没病，但他决不是一个健康的人，决不可能像健康的人一样从事工作。这情况就大大值得犯错误受批评的人注意：犯了错误之后，不但要承认错误，而且要改正错误，不但要改正错误，而且要十分注意扫除那因此而引起的消极、阴暗情绪，要勇敢地抬起头来，信心百倍地从事工作。这情况也值得批评者和领导者注意。对犯错误的人，要狠狠地批评，决不妥协调和；但在既然承认错误以后，又要给以鼓励和支持，帮助他们改变消极情绪，使他们抬起头来积极工作。正像负责的医生一样，治病时痛下针灸，不怕因此引起病人痛苦，病好后还要尽心护理调养，务使病人迅速复原。
    就在这看来似乎矛盾的低头抬头之间，却充分体现出我们使用批评武器治病救人的积极态度，以及被批评者对待批评的积极态度！
