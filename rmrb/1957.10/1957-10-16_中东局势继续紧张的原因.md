　　The Reasons for the Continuing Tensions in the Middle East
　　By a staff commentator of this newspaper

    The United States, at the instigation of Turkey, continues to concentrate troops on the Syrian border and constantly provokes incidents, which is increasingly threatening Syria's security and the peace of the Middle East.

    After Khrushchev's interview with a "New York Times" reporter on October 7, warning the United States and Turkey not to play with fire in the Middle East, although the U.S. State Department hurriedly declared that the United States had not forced Turkey or any other country to go to war with Syria, and the Turkish government also denied any intention of attacking Syria, many irrefutable facts show that these "transparently false" statements by the U.S. and Turkish authorities are merely attempts to conceal their war preparations. Following the U.S. Marine Corps exercises off the Turkish coast, Turkish armored forces and tens of thousands of infantry, commanded by U.S. generals, have stepped up their concentration on the Turkish-Syrian border. The Turkish Air Force continues to violate Syrian airspace, and its ground forces continue to provoke incidents on the Syrian border. According to various sources, senior U.S. military and diplomatic officials have recently held three secret meetings with Turkish authorities to specifically study the issue of increasing "U.S. aid" to support Turkish aggression. These facts are enough to show that the United States is stepping up its efforts to instigate Turkish aggression against Syria. This is the real reason why the situation in the Middle East remains very tense, despite repeated efforts by Arab countries and peace-loving people around the world.

    These conspiratorial activities of the U.S. aggressors have aroused high vigilance among the people of Arab countries in the Middle East. Arab countries in the Middle East, determined to safeguard their national independence, have long stated that if a war of aggression against Syria occurs, they will resolutely stand on the side of the Syrian people and fight together to safeguard the supreme interests of Arab nationalism. According to the provisions of the joint defense treaty, Egyptian troops arrived at the port of Latakia in Syria on October 13 to strengthen Syria's military forces resisting aggression, which fully demonstrates the determination of the people of Arab countries to defend their nationalism and independence at any cost.

    This timely and noble action by the Egyptian armed forces strongly supports the Syrian people's current just struggle to safeguard their independence and greatly encourages the confidence of the people of other Arab countries in their struggle for independence; and it is a serious warning to U.S. imperialism and its servant states. It means that the imperialists' long-standing conspiracy to divide and defeat the oppressed countries one by one is no longer working. The forces of Arab nationalism are becoming increasingly united in their actions against imperialist aggression and in defense of peace in the Middle East.

    The unity of the Arab people is something that U.S. aggressors greatly fear and deeply resent. Therefore, after Egypt and Syria announced the landing of Egyptian troops in Latakia, Syria, the United States continued to try to instigate Turkey, saying that "Turkey can hardly ignore this"; at the same time, it openly encouraged Turkey to carry out aggression against Arab countries, believing that "the Turkish army can drive straight into Syria" and that "the total number of Egyptian and Syrian troops combined will not be able to defeat Turkey's 500,000-strong army, which is adequately equipped and trained with modern American weapons." The urgent desire of the United States to provoke Turkey to launch a war of aggression against Syria and other Arab countries is very obvious and extremely sinister. At such a critical moment, if the Turkish authorities fail to soberly assess the entire Middle East situation and the world situation and listen to the instigation of the U.S. aggressors, and ignite the flames of war in the Middle East, the result will only be that Turkey will be a cat's-paw for the United States, bringing endless disasters to the Turkish people.

    Today, the entire Middle East situation and the world situation clearly show that once Turkey launches a war of aggression against Syria, there is nothing to guarantee that the war will only be confined to one region. The people of Arab countries will become more united in the war and will resolutely resist; and peace-loving countries and people all over the world will firmly stand on the side of Syria and Arab countries, supporting their just struggle.

　　中东局势继续紧张的原因
　　本报评论员
    美国嗾使土耳其继续把军队集结于叙利亚边境，并不断进行挑衅，正日益严重地威胁着叙利亚的安全和中东地区的和平。
    赫鲁晓夫10月7日对“纽约时报”记者发表谈话，警告美国和土耳其不要在中东地区玩火之后，虽然美国国务院赶忙声明美国没有强迫土耳其或其他任何国家同叙利亚进行战争，土耳其政府也否认有任何进攻叙利亚的意图；但是，许多无可辩驳的事实说明，美国和土耳其当局这些“此地无银三百两”的声明，不过是企图掩饰它们准备战争的活动罢了。继美国陆战队在土耳其沿海举行演习以后，由美国将军指挥的土耳其的装甲部队和数万步兵，已加紧在土耳其—叙利亚的边境上结集。土耳其的空军不断侵犯叙利亚的领空，它的地面部队也继续对叙利亚国境进行挑衅。据各方面透露，美国军事和外交高级官员最近曾连续同土耳其当局举行了三次秘密会议，具体研究了增加“美援”以支持土耳其进行侵略活动的问题。这些事实足以说明美国加紧策动土耳其侵略叙利亚的活动。这就是在阿拉伯国家和世界爱好和平人民一再努力之后，中东局势仍然十分紧张的真实原因。
    美国侵略者的这些阴谋活动，已经引起了中东阿拉伯各国人民的高度警惕。决心维护自己民族独立的中东阿拉伯国家早已表示，一旦发生对叙利亚的侵略战争，它们将坚决地站在叙利亚人民一边，为维护阿拉伯民族主义的最高利益而一起斗争。根据共同防御条约的规定，埃及部队10月13日已经开抵叙利亚的拉塔基亚港，以加强叙利亚抵抗侵略的军事力量，这充分表现了阿拉伯国家人民不惜任何代价来保卫他们的民族主义和独立的决心。
    埃及武装部队这一及时的高尚的行动，有力地支持了叙利亚人民当前维护独立的正义斗争，大大地鼓舞了阿拉伯其它国家人民争取独立斗争的信心；并且是对美帝国主义和它的仆从国家的一个严肃的警告。它意味着长期以来帝国主义者所玩弄的分化和各个击破被压迫国家的阴谋已经行不通了。阿拉伯民族主义力量在反对帝国主义侵略和保卫中东和平的行动中，是越来越团结一致了。
    阿拉伯人民的团结，这是美国侵略者十分害怕和深恶痛绝的。因此，在埃叙两国宣布埃及部队在叙利亚的拉塔基亚港登陆的消息后，美国方面就继续竭力教唆土耳其，说什么“土耳其很难对此置之不理”；同时公开鼓励土耳其对阿拉伯国家进行侵略，认为“土耳其陆军能够长驱直入叙利亚”，“埃及和叙利亚的全部部队的总和都不会敌得过土耳其的以美国现代化武器得到足够的装备和训练的五十万人的陆军”。美国力图挑起土耳其对叙利亚和其它阿拉伯国家侵略战争的急迫心情，是十分明显的，也是极端阴险的。在这样的紧急关头，土耳其当局如果不能清醒地估计整个中东局势和世界局势，竟然听从美国侵略者的教唆，在中东挑起战火，结果只能是为美国火中取栗，给土耳其人民带来无穷的灾祸。
    今天整个中东局势和世界局势都清楚地说明，一旦土耳其对叙利亚发动侵略战争，那就没有任何东西可以保证战争只会局限于一个地区。阿拉伯各国人民在战争中将会更加团结起来，坚决进行抵抗；而全世界爱好和平的国家和人民也将坚决站在叙利亚和阿拉伯国家一边，支持它们的正义斗争。
