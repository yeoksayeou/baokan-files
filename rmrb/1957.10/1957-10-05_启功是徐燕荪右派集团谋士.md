Column: On the Anti-Rightist Front

    Qi Gong, a director of the Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association, colluded with Xu Yansun, Ye Gongchuo, and others to resist the Communist Party's policy on Chinese painting. He often offered ideas to Xu Yansun and drafted documents for him. Qi Gong opposed the orientation of Chinese painting serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and especially opposed the "bringing forth the new from the old" in Chinese painting. He proposed that the painting world "should look more at ancient paintings and less at modern paintings." As an editorial board member of the "Guohua" (Chinese Painting) quarterly, he attempted to turn the "Guohua" quarterly into a publication that would not publish argumentative articles or modern paintings, and would oppose the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy. Xu Yansun's speech at the inaugural meeting of the Beijing Chinese Painting Academy was drafted by Qi Gong. In the speech, Qi Gong slandered the Communist Party and the government for suppressing and not valuing Chinese painting. In February of this year, when Qi Gong returned to Shanghai, he promoted the idea that "the affairs of Chinese painters should be handled by Chinese painters" and that there was no need for the leadership of the Communist Party. These words had a very bad influence on Chinese painters in Shanghai.
    Now, in the face of solid facts and powerful and justified criticism, Qi Gong has admitted that he committed "serious anti-Communist and anti-socialist crimes." He has begun to confess his problems and has also exposed some of Ye Gongchuo's anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds.

    启功是徐燕荪右派集团谋士
    北京市中国画研究会理事启功和徐燕荪、叶恭绰等结合在一起对抗共产党对国画的政策，并且常为徐燕荪出主意，草拟文稿。启功反对国画为工农兵服务的方针，特别反对国画的“推陈出新”，提出绘画界“应当多看古画，少看现代画。”他是“国画”季刊的编委，却企图把“国画”季刊变成不登辩论性的文章、不登现代绘画作品、以反对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的刊物。徐燕荪在北京中国画院成立大会上的发言稿是由启功代拟的，启功在讲稿中诬蔑共产党和政府压制和不重视国画。今年2月间启功回上海时就宣扬“国画家的事应由国画家来办”，不要共产党的领导。这些话对上海的国画家起了很坏的影响。
    现在启功在确凿的事实和有理有力的批判面前，承认了自己犯了“严重的反共反社会主义的罪行”；对自己的问题开始作交代，并且还揭露了叶恭绰的一部分反共反社会主义的言行。
