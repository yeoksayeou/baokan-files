Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: Damascus News: A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on October 26th that 100,000 Turkish troops have been amassed along the Syrian border. He said that troops had been gathering before, but "never in such large numbers as now." He added that Turkish troops are generally stationed about ten miles from the border, but sometimes much closer.

The Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman also said: The exercises planned by the United States and Turkey to be held off the Turkish coast at the end of October "may conceal a planned military operation."

He also said that information received by the Syrian Foreign Ministry indicated that Israel would "play a role" if Turkey launched an attack.

On the same day, a communique issued by the Syrian News Agency stated that on the 25th, two Turkish patrols from the Turkish outposts of Nusaybin and Mehaish on the Turkish-Syrian border crossed the border and intruded into Syrian territory. One of them intruded 500 meters into Syrian territory and stole sheep and their owners. The other fired at a Syrian army outpost.

The communique said that a Turkish aircraft flew over the Syrian village of Maidan Ikbis near the Syrian-Turkish border on the 25th. Another unidentified aircraft from Turkish Nusaybin also violated Syrian airspace on the same day, flying over the northern border area of Syria.

According to reports, on the same day, two jet aircraft from the Mediterranean Sea flew over the Syrian village of Arida near the Syrian-Lebanese border for nearly five minutes. It is believed that these aircraft belong to the US Sixth Fleet.

According to a Syrian Army spokesman on the evening of the 26th, an Israeli scout sneaked into Syrian territory and fired at the Jerebina village outpost on the southern Syrian border. The spokesman said in a statement: "Our outpost returned fire, and the Israeli scout ran away."

Cairo News: According to the "Al-Ahram" report on October 26th, Syrian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Bizri told the newspaper reporter that if the United Nations fails to agree to send a fact-finding mission to the Syrian-Turkish border, "the entire responsibility will be borne by the United States, because it is the root of the trouble."

He also said that Syria is "fully prepared to deal with any eventuality."

Bizri also said: "The Egyptian troops sent to Syria are a real striking force, and they have secured many positions for us."

    本报综合报道　据新华社27日讯：大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部发言人10月26日说，沿着叙利亚边境已经集结了十万土耳其部队。他说，以前也一直有部队集结，但是“从来没有像现在这么多”。他又说，土耳其部队一般驻在离开边境约十英里的地方，但是有时候近得多。
    叙利亚外交部发言人还说：美国和土耳其计划10月底在土耳其沿海举行的演习“可能隐藏着一种有计划的军事行动”。
    他又说，叙利亚外交部接到的消息表明，一旦土耳其发动进攻时，以色列将“起一种作用”。
    同一天，叙利亚新闻局发表的公报说，有两支从土—叙边境上的土耳其据点奴息本和麦海什来的土耳其巡逻队在25日曾经越境侵入叙利亚边境。其中一支侵入叙利亚领土达五百公尺，并且抢走了羊只和它们的主人。另一支向一处叙利亚陆军据点开枪。
    公报说，一架土耳其飞机在25日飞过叙利亚—土耳其边境线附近的叙利亚村庄麦丹伊克比斯的上空。另外一架来自土耳其奴息本的国籍不明的飞机也在同一天侵犯了叙利亚的领空，从叙利亚北部边境地区的上空飞过。
    据报道，同一天还有两架来自地中海的喷气式飞机在叙利亚—黎巴嫩边境附近的叙利亚村庄阿里达赫的上空飞行了将近五分钟。据信，这些飞机属于美国第六舰队的。
    据叙利亚陆军发言人26日晚说，一名以色列侦察兵潜入叙利亚境内向叙利亚南部边境上的杰雷比纳村据点开枪射击。发言人在一项声明中说：“我们的据点开枪回击，这名以色列侦察兵就跑掉了。”
    开罗消息：据“金字塔报”10月26日报道，叙利亚武装部队总司令比兹里对这家报纸记者说，如果联合国未能同意派遣一个调查团到叙—土边境去的话，“全部责任要由美国来负，因为它是祸根”。
    他还说，叙利亚已经“充分准备应付万一”。
    比兹里还说：“派到叙利亚的埃及部队，是一支真正的打击力量，它为我们据守了很多阵地。”
