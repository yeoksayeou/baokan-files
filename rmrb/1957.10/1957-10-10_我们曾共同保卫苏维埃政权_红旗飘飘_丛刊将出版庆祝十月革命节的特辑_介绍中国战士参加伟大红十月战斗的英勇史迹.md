We Once Jointly Defended the Soviet Regime
"Red Flag Fluttering" Serial Publication to Publish Special Issue Celebrating the October Revolution
Introducing the Heroic Deeds of Chinese Soldiers Participating in the Great October Battles

    To welcome the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters began extensively collecting historical materials about Chinese people participating in the Soviet October Revolution and Civil War in the spring of this year. The goal is to organize and compile these materials into a book, so that the general public can know that in those days of fighting against enemies to establish and defend the Soviet regime, the blood of the Chinese people was already flowing together with the blood of the Russian people, jointly nurturing the deep brotherly friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.
    According to existing materials, during the First World War, the Tsarist government recruited hundreds of thousands of coolies from China to work in Russia. Most of these people were poor peasants from Northeast China, Shandong, Hebei, and Zhejiang.
    During 1917-1918, the storm of revolution swept across Russia. Inspired by their class instincts, Chinese workers held a high degree of sympathy and hope for the Russian Revolution. They joined guerrilla units and Red Guards in batches, and participated in the Red Army, fighting alongside Russian workers and peasants to defend the great cause of the proletarian revolution. In the Red Army, there were not only individual Chinese soldiers, but also Chinese squads, Chinese platoons, Chinese companies, Chinese battalions, Chinese regiments, and even the organization of the Chinese Red International Brigade. As early as last winter, the Institute of China Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences began collecting materials and decided to write a book about Chinese people participating in the struggle to establish Soviet power in Russia. The Institute of China Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences organized writers to follow the traces of several Chinese troops active on various fronts of the Civil War. They went through many places, visited participants and witnesses of the battles of that time, and discovered interesting and previously unpublished archival materials, notes, documents, and photos and other valuable information. In addition to recording the memories of Chinese veterans living in various parts of the Soviet Union, they also directly contacted the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters to further collect memories of Chinese soldiers who had participated in the revolutionary war in Russia and then returned to their homeland. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters decided to cooperate with the Institute of China Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and it is expected that the book will be officially published in 1958.
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters has decided to select a portion of the materials collected so far and publish them in the fourth collection of the "Red Flag Fluttering" serial publication, published by China Youth Publishing House, as a "Special Issue Celebrating the Fortieth Anniversary of the October Revolution," for the enjoyment of readers. In this special issue, in addition to publishing four translated articles, including Voroshilov's "My First Meeting with Lenin" and Belyshev's "Epoch-Making Gunfire," who was the chairman of the committee of the cruiser "Aurora" during the October Revolution uprising, it mainly narrates the memories of more than twenty Chinese veterans who participated in the Great October Battles. Here are the heroic deeds of Comrade Li Fuqing, Lenin's Chinese bodyguard, and the glorious experiences of Comrade Shang Zhen, a Chinese worker who won the Order of Lenin; here are the stories of the old hero Liu Fuhe, who fought against the White bandits and Czech rebels in the Urals, and Chen Baichuan, the deputy captain of the "Old Man Team" of the guerrilla team in the Hailanpao area; here also introduces the growth process and brilliant achievements of the Sino-Soviet mixed guerrilla team and the Chinese Red Guards in the revolutionary struggle in the North Caucasus. This issue of "Red Flag Fluttering" contains approximately 250,000 words in total, and will be sold by Xinhua Bookstore in mid-October. (Attached picture)

    我们曾共同保卫苏维埃政权
    “红旗飘飘”丛刊将出版庆祝十月革命节的特辑
    介绍中国战士参加伟大红十月战斗的英勇史迹
    为了迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年，中苏友好协会总会从今年春天即已开始广泛收集关于中国人参加苏联十月革命和国内战争的史料，准备整理编辑成书，以便使广大读者知道：在那些为建立和保卫苏维埃政权而同敌人搏斗的日子里，中国人的鲜血就早已同俄国人的鲜血流在一起，共同培育了中苏两国人民深厚的兄弟情谊。
    根据现有的材料，在第一次世界大战期间，沙皇政府曾从中国招募了几十万苦力去俄国做工。这些人大都是东北、山东、河北和浙江一带的贫苦农民。
    在1917—1918年期间，革命的风暴席卷了全俄国。中国工人在阶级本能的启示下，对俄国革命怀着高度的同情和希望。他们成批地参加了游击队和赤卫队，参加了红军，和俄国工人、农民并肩保卫无产阶级革命的伟大事业。在红军部队里，不但有个别的中国士兵，而且有中国班、中国排、中国连、中国营、中国团，也有中国的红色国际大队的组织。早在去年冬天，苏联科学院中国研究所就开始收集资料，决定编写一本有关中国人参加在俄国为建立苏维埃政权而斗争的书籍。苏联科学院中国研究所曾经组织作家沿着在国内战争各战线上活动的几个中国部队的足迹，经历了许多地方，访问了当年各次战役的参加者和目击者，发现了有趣的、至今尚未发表过的档案材料、笔记、文件和照片等珍贵资料。他们除已经记录了住在苏联各地的中国老战士的回忆以外，还直接同中苏友好协会总会取得联系，进一步收集曾在俄国参加革命战争以后返回祖国的中国战士的回忆。中苏友好协会总会决定和苏联科学院中国研究所合作，预计在1958年内正式出书。
    中苏友好协会总会决定从现在已收集到的材料中选出一部分，在中国青年出版社出版的“红旗飘飘”丛刊第四集上，作为“庆祝十月革命四十周年特辑”发表，以飨读者。在这本特辑里，除刊登了伏罗希洛夫写的“我第一次会见列宁”和十月革命起义时担任“阿芙乐尔”号军舰委员会主席的别雷舍夫所写的“划时代的炮声”等四篇译文以外，主要地记述了二十多位曾经参加伟大红十月战斗的中国老战士的回忆。这里有列宁的中国卫士李富清同志一生的英雄事迹，荣获列宁勋章的中国工人尚真同志的光荣经历；这里谈到了曾在乌拉尔抗击白匪和捷克叛军的老英雄刘福和、曾任海兰泡地区游击队“老头队”副队长的陈柏川的战斗故事；这里还介绍了中苏混合游击队和在北高加索革命斗争中的中国赤卫队的成长过程与辉煌战绩。这一期“红旗飘飘”共计约二十五万字，将在10月中旬由新华书店发售。（附图片）
