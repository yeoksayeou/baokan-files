Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 11th -- The President's House of Pakistan announced this afternoon that Suhrawardy has resigned from his position as Prime Minister of Pakistan, and President Mirza has accepted his resignation.

Suhrawardy's resignation was considered inevitable due to the deepening divisions between the two parties forming the Pakistan Central Coalition Government, namely the Republican Party and the Awami League, with the Republican Party withdrawing its support for Suhrawardy.

The main reason for the split was a resolution passed last month by the West Pakistan Provincial Assembly calling for the division of West Pakistan into several provinces, a resolution supported by the Republican Party. However, Suhrawardy delivered a speech in West Pakistan last week, supporting the proposition that West Pakistan should remain as a single administrative unit and fiercely attacking the Republican Party, deepening the division. Republican Party leaders accused his speech of being a "war of slander."

    巴基斯坦执政党分裂
    苏拉瓦底辞去总理职务
    据新华社卡拉奇11日电　巴基斯坦总统府今天午后宣布，苏拉瓦底已经辞去巴基斯坦总理的职务，米尔扎总统接受了他的辞呈。
    由于组成巴基斯坦中央联合政府的两个党派即共和党和人民联盟之间的分歧加深，共和党撤回对苏拉瓦底的支持，他的辞职被认为是必然的结果。
    造成分裂的主要原因是西巴基斯坦省议会上月通过了一项要求把西巴基斯坦分散为几个省的决议，这个决议受到共和党的支持。但是，苏拉瓦底上星期在西巴基斯坦发表演说，支持西巴基斯坦仍旧作为单一行政单位的主张，并且猛烈攻击共和党，使得这种分歧加深了，共和党领袖们指责他的演说是“诽谤中伤的战争”。
