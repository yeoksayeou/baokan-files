Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th: Leading cadres of the Hefei Mining Machinery Factory have corrected their attitude towards the rectification campaign and strengthened rectification efforts, causing the morale of workers and masses in airing opinions to shift from a slump to a surge. Now, the number of big-character posters put up by workers throughout the factory has increased from the original 242 to 2,276, and workers are basically able to express their opinions and feelings.

The leading cadres of this factory originally had many concerns and incorrect understandings about the factory's rectification campaign. They were afraid that the workers' airing of opinions would disrupt the factory, affect production, and "burn" themselves, so they did not dare to boldly mobilize the workers to air opinions. They also mistakenly believed that the rectification campaign was simply about opposing rightists, and they regarded some opinions on production management and cadre work style raised by workers as minor issues and did not promptly handle or respond to them.

Under these circumstances, the morale of the workers in airing opinions was very low. They saw that the leadership had no sincerity in improving their work and style, and they did not dare to boldly offer opinions. In the first twenty days or so of airing opinions, only 242 big-character posters were put up by more than 1,700 workers throughout the factory; only 22 big-character posters were put up by more than 420 administrative and technical personnel. Many workers had an indifferent attitude towards the rectification campaign and were not interested in airing opinions.

After discovering the above situation, the Industrial and Transportation Department of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party helped the leading cadres of this factory analyze and check the shortcomings of the previous stage of work, criticized the incorrect understanding of the rectification campaign by the leading cadres, and promptly handled the opinions already raised by the workers, organizing forces to solve 193 problems in just five days, and formulated specific solutions for problems that could not be solved immediately.

Due to the improvement of the ideological understanding of the leading cadres and the strengthening of the rectification while correcting work, the morale of the masses in airing opinions was greatly encouraged. The workers generally reflected: "Problems are really being solved now, and the leadership style is also changing." People who did not speak out in the past are now posting big-character posters one after another. According to statistics for the most recent five days alone, workers have posted more than 700 big-character posters, with wide-ranging and vivid content.

### 领导干部端正整风态度  职工鸣放情绪转趋高涨

　　领导干部端正整风态度
    职工鸣放情绪转趋高涨
    据新华社合肥15日电　合肥矿山机器厂领导干部端正对整风的态度，加强整改工作，使职工群众大鸣大放的情绪由消沉转为高涨。现在，全厂职工贴出的大字报已经由原来的二百四十二张增加到二千二百七十六张，职工们基本上都能把自己的意见和心里话说出来。
    这个厂的领导干部原来对企业整风存有许多顾虑和不正确的认识。他们怕职工鸣放把工厂搞乱、怕影响生产和怕“惹火烧身”，因此不敢大胆放手地发动职工鸣放。他们还错误地认为整风就是单纯地反右派，而对职工们提出的一些生产管理和干部作风的意见，则认为都是小问题，没有及时地进行处理和答复。
    在这种情况下，职工大鸣大放的情绪非常消沉。他们看到领导方面没有改进工作和作风的诚意，都不敢大胆提意见。在开始大鸣大放的二十多天中，全厂一千七百多名职工仅贴出了二百四十二张大字报；四百二十多个行政和技术人员只贴了二十二张大字报。许多职工对整风抱着无所谓的态度，对大鸣大放不感兴趣。
    中共安徽省委工业交通部发现上述情况以后，帮助这个厂的领导干部对前一阶段工作的缺点进行了分析和检查，批判了领导干部对整风的不正确的认识，对职工已经提出的意见，组织力量及时地进行了处理，仅五天的时间即解决了一百九十三个问题，对一时不能解决的问题也拟定了具体解决的方案。
    由于领导干部思想认识的提高和加强了边整边改工作，大大鼓舞了群众大鸣大放的情绪。职工们普遍地反映说：“这下真解决问题了，领导作风也在转变了。过去不发言的人，现在也都纷纷贴出了大字报。仅最近五天的统计，职工就贴出了大字报七百多张，内容广泛生动。
