Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held three consecutive conferences from the 23rd to the 25th to systematically expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of rightist Chen Mingshu. Faced with a large number of facts, Chen Mingshu could not deny it and began to lower his head and confess his guilt.

The meeting was presided over by Zhu Yunshan, Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee. The meeting was attended by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, Cai Tingkai, Vice Chairman, members of the Central Committee, alternate members of the Central Committee, heads of various departments, and all cadres of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, totaling more than 500 people.

    Li Jishen pointed out that Chen Mingshu had always been reactionary and had not repented after liberation.

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, said at the meeting that the rightist Chen Mingshu, in order to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose socialism, formulated a set of programs for attacking the Communist Party, attempting to restore capitalism and allow the counter-revolutionary rulers to make a comeback. In order to promote his reactionary program, he wooed backward elements, organized scum, engaged in various conspiracies, and attempted to usurp the leadership of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee and control the local organizations of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee. He is a two-faced, rumor-mongering right-wing conspirator. He used double-dealing tactics to launch vicious attacks on the Communist Party. On the surface, he said some complimentary things to the Communist Party, but in reality, he colluded with dissatisfied elements and bad elements in various agencies and schools, collected the shortcomings in the work of the Communist Party and the government, exaggerated or distorted them, and even fabricated facts to launch a large-scale attack on the Party.

Li Jishen pointed out that Chen Mingshu is a consistently reactionary, old-brand rightist. He once echoed Chen Jiongming's betrayal of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, supported Chiang Kai-shek's crackdown on the anti-Chiang movement, and obstructed the 19th Route Army's anti-Chiang and anti-Japanese resistance. After liberation, he did not repent. Li Jishen emphasized that the struggle meeting in the past few days has given us all a good education. Everyone must earnestly accept the leadership of the Communist Party, overcome bourgeois ideology, and resolutely take the socialist road. Otherwise, there will be a danger of falling into the rightist quagmire.

    Li Shizhang systematically criticized Chen Mingshu's anti-communist program.

Li Shizhang, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, systematically criticized Chen Mingshu's anti-communist program. Chen Mingshu drafted a complete set of reactionary programs for attacking the Communist Party and the people in December 1956. Li Shizhang said that Chen Mingshu's anti-communist program is extremely fierce and vicious. Chen Mingshu believes that the Communist Party is a "small group of extremely powerful people" and "has long been divorced from the masses." He also believes that this is the result of Communist Party members "misinterpreting their Party spirit." In Chen Mingshu's view, "Party spirit" is the root cause of factionalism, because he believes that once Communist Party members have "Party spirit," they will "apply the cruel anti-enemy ideology indiscriminately to democratic人士," and that once Communist Party members have "Party spirit," they will "only know that they must loyally and honestly carry out the direct instructions of the Party, but they can be irresponsible to relevant non-Party people." Li Shizhang said that Chen Mingshu meant that Communist Party members should not implement the Party's instructions, that the Communist Party should abolish its organization and discipline, and that Communist Party members should abandon the working-class stance and surrender to the bourgeois rightists. His purpose was to fundamentally disarm the Communist Party and disintegrate the Communist Party.

Li Shizhang said that Chen Mingshu slandered the Communist Party's mass line. He divided the masses into two categories: namely, "positive flow and non-positive flow, righteous spirit and evil spirit." In Chen Mingshu's view, those who faithfully accept the leadership of the Communist Party and resolutely take the socialist road are "non-positive flow," so he slandered all democratic figures who support the leadership of the Communist Party and support socialism as "followers," while the rightists who frantically attacked the Communist Party are "those who dare to speak out and are honest and uncompromising." Rightists and counter-revolutionaries such as Xu Yiguan, Wang Guihun, Xie Xin, Cao Renyuan, and Luo Haisha are "positive flow."

Li Shizhang said that Chen Mingshu believes that the Communist Party's leadership through organizations such as the Communist Youth League and trade unions is a "multi-section whip" leadership method, which is the root cause of creating "walls" and "gullies." He believes that studying Marxism-Leninism and using Marxism-Leninism to observe and handle problems and analyze people is "stubbornly adhering to dogmas and political slogans to approach people." He spread the fallacy that the Communist Party cannot lead schools everywhere, attempting to abolish the Communist Party's organizational leadership and political and ideological leadership together.

Li Shizhang said that Chen Mingshu has a deep-seated class hatred for the Communist Party and the people. He viciously slandered the old Communist Party members as "self-appointed mountain strongholds, confined to factions, subjectively arbitrary, and bureaucratic," and scolded the new Party members as "yes-men, flattering and speculating." Therefore, Chen Mingshu wanted to "cut off the old Communist Party members like carbuncles," and constantly "cleanse" the new Party members. In short, he wanted to kill all the Communist Party members before he would be satisfied.

Li Shizhang said that as a spokesman for the reactionary ruling class, Chen Mingshu does not like the great turnaround of the Chinese people and is not reconciled to the death of the exploitation system. He opposes all socialist transformation and construction. He slandered socialist construction as "being eager for quick success and eager for quick profits," opposed the socialist transformation of agriculture, and believed that "cooperativization has no achievements, the high tide of cooperativization came too early, and the peasants are very bitter." He opposed the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, supported Zhang Naiqi's fallacies, and especially opposed the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, slandering the activists in the movement as "ruthlessly wielding heavy hammers, vainly hoping to use them as stepping stones for promotion." He slandered those who had awakened in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, who had rebelled and rendered meritorious service, as "kicking people when they are down, betraying friends for glory, breaking their promises and biting back, and selling their conscience." Chen Mingshu hated the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement so much because the suppression of counter-revolutionaries had cleared away the counter-revolutionaries, and his fantasy of the comeback of the reactionary rulers could not be realized. Li Shizhang pointed out that Chen Mingshu never forgot the comeback of the Kuomintang reactionaries. On June 2, when Chen Mingshu held a large banquet for his cronies at the home of Wu Yiwu, a key member of his small group in Shanghai, he uttered the wild words "The red flag covers the world, the green changes in the eyes, do not let down the wishes of the people, and let us create happiness and well-being together." He also estimated that the situation at the time was "the formation is set, and the crossbows are gathered and waiting to be fired," thinking that the Communist Party was about to be driven off the stage and the Kuomintang was about to return.

    Zhou Jiubang and Xin Jiazhou exposed Chen Mingshu's small group activities.

Zhou Jiubang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, came to Beijing specially to attend this meeting. At the meeting, he exposed Chen Mingshu's conspiracy activities in Shanghai on May 21 this year to solicit his "old friends" and "old subordinates" to organize a reactionary small group. The key members of this small group included Luo Haisha, Yu Ruonan, Liu Haiting, Zhao Jishun, and Wu Yiwu. Under the instigation of Chen Mingshu, this small group of rightists attempted to restore the Shenzhou Guoguang Society, which had been incorporated into the New Knowledge Publishing House as a joint public-private enterprise organization, as a base for small group activities, in order to contact his old subordinates and more people who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party, and to attack the Communist Party from the cultural front. The Shenzhou Guoguang Society used to be the base of the Trotskyists. Chen Mingshu and others attempted to restore this organization in order to recruit Trotskyists through it and carry out activities against Marxism-Leninism and against the Communist Party ideologically and theoretically. Chen Mingshu also supported Luo Haisha in promoting great democracy in schools, attempting to drive away the Communist Party branch secretary. In order to establish a base for anti-communism and anti-people, Chen Mingshu not only wanted to restore the Shenzhou Guoguang Society, but also planned to usurp the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, attempting to use it as a base for attacking the Communist Party.

Xin Jiazhou, a member of the Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, also came to Beijing to attend the meeting. He exposed Chen Mingshu's reactionary activities in Shandong. Chen Mingshu colluded with rightists Fan Yushui (Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee), Xu Yiguan (Chairman of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee), and Wang Guihun in Shandong Province to form a conspiracy small group, which paralyzed and disintegrated the Shandong Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee organization. In February this year, Chen Mingshu also gave Xu Yiguan five instructions as a strategy for attacking the Communist Party. Chen Mingshu asked him to speak after observing the effect and the signs; he wanted him to focus on attacking the Communist Party and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement on the issue of factionalism. He said that the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee is aging, and Qingdao is young and strong, so we must pay attention to attracting and developing senior intellectuals. He also said that after the blooming and contending, the CPPCC organization may be changed to a two-chamber system.

    Luo Weizhi, a key member of Chen Mingshu's reactionary small group, exposed and confessed some conspiracy activities.

Luo Weizhi, a key member of Chen Mingshu's reactionary small group in Beijing, also exposed and confessed some of their conspiracy activities at the meeting. Luo Weizhi said that he was one of the planners of Chen Mingshu's "anti-communist ten-thousand-word letter" to attack the Communist Party after Chen Mingshu inspected Beijing in November 1956 in a "secret way." He was the running dog who collected poisonous weeds for Chen Mingshu. Chen Mingshu once instructed him to "find some materials on bureaucracy in secondary schools, collect as many shortcomings as possible, including people who have been wronged in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, people who have problems with wage assessment and grading, superiors who retaliate against subordinates, as well as materials on Communist Party members' subjectivism, bureaucracy, factionalism, and teaching and life." He also said: "Tell the people you find that they should have no worries and no fears. Write materials that they dare not write and dare not say in school. I will definitely solve the problem for them. You can guarantee them."

Luo Weizhi said that Chen Mingshu also held two teacher forums at his home. Those who participated in the forum included Luo Weizhi, Wang Zhinan, Cao Renyuan, and Fan Xiaoge. Chen Mingshu said at the time: "Please boldly expose all the shortcomings and various incorrect styles of the school leaders. Those who have been wronged in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, let them write materials. Problems about wage assessment, grading, retaliation, the bureaucracy of the Education Bureau, students' theft, and love can be discussed first and then written. Whether you want to be famous or not, I can use my status as a People's Representative to solve the problems for you and keep them secret for you."

Luo Weizhi said that after Chen Mingshu had collected all the materials for attacking the Communist Party, he began to write the "anti-communist ten-thousand-word letter." Wang Zhinan, Cao Renyuan, Huang Jusu, and Luo Weizhi participated in the opinions and finalizing the manuscript.

When fighting the rightist leader Zhang Bojun, Chen Mingshu, after returning from Shanghai, instructed Luo Weizhi to talk to Yan Xinmin, one of the conveners of the rectification leadership committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party: "Do not beat Zhang Bojun to death with one stick, but rescue Zhang Bojun."

Chen Mingshu made two speeches at the meeting. Faced with a large number of facts, he had to start bowing his head and admitting his guilt. He said that his reactionary words and deeds were "serious," and he expressed "bowing his head and admitting his guilt to the people of the whole country." Chen Mingshu said: "I admit that I have a complete set of anti-communist and anti-socialist reactionary programs, as well as the crimes of organizing small group conspiracy activities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shandong; I admit the crime of writing the 'anti-communist ten-thousand-word letter' to attack the Party; I admit the crime of using religious relations to carry out anti-communist conspiracy activities." Chen Mingshu said: "These crimes are serious, and I am willing to repent and start anew."

Mei Gongbin, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, Weng Dujian, Director of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, Zhou Faqi, Vice President of the Beijing Institute of Technology, Juhzan, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China, as well as Weng Wenhao, Zhang Lianfen, Cai Tingkai, Jiang Guangnai, Chen Qiyuan, and Zhu Yunshan also exposed and criticized Chen Mingshu at the meeting.

    民革中央彻底批判陈铭枢
    在大量的事实面前，陈铭枢承认有一套反共、反社会主义纲领，进行了反共阴谋活动。
    新华社28日讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央在23日到25日连续举行了三次大会，系统地揭露和批判右派分子陈铭枢的反动言行。陈铭枢在大量的事实面前，无法抵赖，开始低头认罪。
    会议由民革中央组织部长朱蕴山主持。出席会议的有民革主席李济深，副主席蔡廷锴，中委、候补中委、各部门负责人，以及民革中央和民革北京市委的全体干部共五百多人。
    李济深指出陈铭枢一贯反动，解放后，并没有悔改
    民革主席李济深在会上说，右派分子陈铭枢为了推翻共产党的领导和反对社会主义，制定了一套向共产党进攻的纲领，妄图使资本主义复辟和使反革命统治者卷土重来。他为了推销他的反动纲领，到处拉拢落后分子，组织败类，从事种种阴谋活动，并且企图篡夺民革中央领导，控制民革地方组织。他是一个口是心非、造谣生事的右派阴谋家。他采取两面派手法向共产党进行恶毒的攻击。他表面对共产党说一些恭维的话，而实际上却勾结各机关、学校中的不满分子和坏分子，搜集共产党和政府工作中的缺点，加以夸大或歪曲，甚至捏造事实向党大肆进攻。
    李济深指出，陈铭枢是个一贯反动的老牌右派分子。他曾附和陈炯明背叛孙中山先生，拥护过蒋介石打击反蒋运动，阻挠十九路军反蒋抗日。解放后，他并没有悔改。李济深强调说，这几天的斗争会，给了我们大家很好的教育，我们每个人都必须认真接受共产党的领导，克服资产阶级思想，坚决走社会主义道路。否则，就会有堕入右派泥坑的危险。
    李世璋系统地批判了陈铭枢的反共纲领
    民革中央常务委员李世璋系统地批判了陈铭枢的反共纲领。陈铭枢在1956年12月就起草了一套完整的向共产党和人民进攻的反动纲领。李世璋说，陈铭枢的反共纲领是异常凶狠和毒辣的。陈铭枢认为，共产党是一个“少数人的极威集团”，“早已脱离群众”，并且认为这是由于共产党员“误执党性”的结果。在陈铭枢看来，“党性”就是产生宗派主义的根源，因为他认为共产党员有了“党性”，就会“以严酷对敌思想漫然施之于民主人士”，共产党员有了“党性”，“只知对党的直接指示要忠诚老实执行，而对非党的有关的人士可以不负责任”。李世璋说，陈铭枢的意思就是要共产党员不要执行党的指示，要共产党取消组织性、纪律性，要共产党员放弃工人阶级立场而向资产阶级右派分子投降，他的目的就是企图从根本上来解除共产党的武装，瓦解共产党。
    李世璋说，陈铭枢诬蔑共产党的群众路线。他把群众分为两类：即“正流与非正流，正气与邪气”。在陈铭枢看来，忠诚地接受共产党的领导，坚决走社会主义道路的人是“非正流”，所以他诬蔑一切拥护共产党的领导、拥护社会主义的民主人士为“趋附之辈”，而向共产党猖狂进攻的右派分子倒是“犯颜敢谏，耿介不苟”的人，徐一贯、王桂浑、谢昕、曹任远、罗海沙等右派分子、反革命分子倒是“正流”。
    李世璋说，陈铭枢认为，通过共产党、共青团和工会等组织实现共产党的领导是“一条多节鞭”的领导方法，是造成“墙壁”和“鸿沟”的根源。他认为学习马克思列宁主义，用马克思列宁主义去观察和处理问题，分析人物，是“死执教条和政治口号去临人”。他到处散布共产党不能领导学校的谬论，企图把共产党的组织领导和政治思想领导一起取消。
    李世璋说，陈铭枢对共产党和人民有着刻骨的阶级仇恨。他恶毒地诬蔑老共产党员是“自封山头，囿于宗派，主观臆断，徙倚官僚”，骂新党员是“唯唯诺诺，趋承揣摩”。因此，陈铭枢对老共产党员要像“癕疽一样割掉”，对新党员要进行经常不断的“清洗”，总之，要把共产党员赶尽杀绝而后快。
    李世璋说，作为反动统治阶级代言人的陈铭枢，是不喜欢中国人民的大翻身，不甘心于剥削制度的死亡的。社会主义的改造和建设他一概反对。他诬蔑社会主义建设是“好大喜功”，反对农业社会主义改造，认为“合作化没有成绩，合作化高潮太早，农民很苦。”他反对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，支持章乃器的谬论，他尤其反对肃反运动，污蔑肃反运动中的积极分子是“狠下重椎，妄冀作升阶的垫脚石”，他诬蔑肃反中觉悟了的起义立功的人是“落井下石，卖友求荣，食言反噬，把良心出卖。”陈铭枢这样仇恨肃反运动，是因为肃清了反革命，他所幻想的反动统治者的卷土重来的阴谋就不能实现了。李世璋指出，陈铭枢对于国民党反动派的卷土重来是念念不忘的。6月2日，陈铭枢在上海小集团骨干吴艺五家里大宴群臣时，曾发出“赤标天下鹄，青换眼中桑，莫负苍生愿，相将造乐康”的狂言。并且利令智昏地估计当时的时局是“阵势已张，集弩待发”，以为共产党就要被撵下台去，国民党就要回来了。
    周旧邦、辛葭舟揭发陈铭枢的小集团活动
    民革上海市委会常委周旧邦专程来北京参加这个大会。他在会上揭发了陈铭枢今年5月21日到上海搜罗他的“老朋友”、“旧部下”组织反动小集团的阴谋活动。这个小集团的骨干分子有罗海沙、余若南、刘海亭、赵继舜、吴艺五等。这一小撮右派分子在陈铭枢的指使下，企图恢复已经并入新知识出版社成为公私合营企业组织的神州国光社，作为小集团活动的据点，以联络他的旧部和更多的对共产党不满的人，从文化战线上向共产党进攻。神州国光社曾经是托派的大本营，陈铭枢等人企图恢复这一组织就是想通过它招揽托派分子，从思想上、理论上进行反对马克思列宁主义、反对共产党的活动。陈铭枢还支持罗海沙在学校里搞大民主，企图赶走共产党的支部书记。陈铭枢为了建立反共反人民的据点，不仅要恢复神州国光社，而且还策划篡夺民革上海市委的领导，企图作为向共产党进攻的根据地。
    民革山东省委常委辛葭舟也来京出席了会议。他揭发了陈铭枢在山东的反动活动。陈铭枢和山东省的右派分子范予遂（民革山东省委主任委员）、徐一贯（民革青岛市委主任委员）、王桂浑勾结在一起结成了阴谋小集团，使山东民革组织陷于瘫痪、解体状态。陈铭枢在今年
  2月还面授徐一贯五点指示作为向共产党进攻的策略，陈铭枢要他看效果、看苗头讲话；要他集中在宗派主义问题上来攻击共产党，攻击肃反运动。他说，民革中央都衰老了，青岛年青力壮，要注意拉拢发展高级知识分子。并且还说，鸣放后，政协机构可能改为两院制。
    陈铭枢反动小集团的骨干分子罗伟之揭发和交代了部分阴谋活动
    陈铭枢在北京的反动小集团的骨干罗伟之也在会上揭发和交代了他们部分的阴谋活动。罗伟之说，他是陈铭枢1956年11月在北京用“秘密方式”视察以后写“反共万言书”向共产党进攻的策划人之一，是替陈铭枢搜集毒草的走卒，陈铭枢曾指示他要“找些中等学校官僚主义方面的材料，多多搜集一些缺点，包括肃反受过冤枉的人，评工资评级有问题的人，上级打击报复下级，以及共产党员主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义和有关教学、生活各方面的材料。”还说：“要对找到的人说，要他们无任何顾虑，不要有任何害怕，写他们在学校里不敢写和不敢说的材料，我一定会替他们解决问题，你可以向他们保证。”
    罗伟之说，陈铭枢还在他的家里召开过两次教师座谈会。参加座谈会的有罗伟之、王之南、曹任远、樊晓歌等。陈铭枢当时说：“请大家大胆地揭发学校领导的一切缺点和各种不正确的作风，肃反中受过冤屈的人，让他们写材料来，关于评工资、评级问题、打击报复问题、教育局的官僚主义问题、学生的偷盗问题、恋爱问题等，都可以先谈出来以后再写，出名也好，不出名也好，我可以用人民代表的身份替你们各位解决问题，为你们保密。”
    罗伟之说，陈铭枢把向共产党进攻的材料搜集齐全以后，就着手写“反共万言书”，参加意见和定稿的人有王之南、曹任远、黄居素和罗伟之等。
      在斗争右派头子章伯钧的时候，陈铭枢从上海回来曾经嘱咐罗伟之向中国农工民主党整风领导委员会召集人之一严信民谈一谈：“不要把章伯钧一棍子打死，要营救章伯钧。”
    陈铭枢在会上作了两次发言，他在大量事实面前不得不开始低头认罪。他说，他的反动言行是“严重的”，他表示“向全国人民低头认罪”。陈铭枢说：“我承认我有一套完整的反共、反社会主义的反动纲领，以及在北京、上海、山东组织小集团的阴谋活动的罪行；我承认我写的向党进攻的‘反共万言书’的罪行；我承认利用宗教关系进行反共阴谋活动。”陈铭枢说：“这些罪行是严重的，我愿意悔过自新，重新作人”。
    在会上揭发和批判陈铭枢的还有民革中央秘书长梅龚彬、北京市教育局长翁独健、北京工业学院副院长周发岐、中国佛教协会副会长巨赞法师，以及翁文灏、张联棻、蔡廷锴、蒋光鼐、陈其瑗、朱蕴山等人。
