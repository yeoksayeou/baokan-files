Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 30th: The Human Rights Committee of the International Red Cross Conference began its meeting in New Delhi on October 29th to discuss the draft rules prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding "limiting the dangers to which civilians are exposed in wartime."

The purpose of these rules is to protect civilians from the effects of any chemical, bacteriological, and radioactive weapons. However, it does not explicitly mention a complete ban on these weapons, especially nuclear weapons, in order to provide protection to people before a war occurs.

The Soviet representative generally supported the basic principles of the draft rules, which are in line with the spirit of humanitarianism, but explicitly pointed out that some clauses have loopholes. He requested that a ban on nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction be explicitly mentioned and suggested establishing a subcommittee to consider various amendments in detail. The Polish government representative proposed amendments to some clauses, hoping to make them clear and specific.

Pan Zili, the head of the Chinese government delegation, fully supported the suggestions of the Soviet and Polish delegations. Pan Zili suggested adding a clause to the draft rules that clearly prohibits nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

The representatives of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic also agreed in principle with the draft rules but requested that a ban on nuclear weapons be explicitly mentioned.

However, Emil Sandström of Sweden believed that since the United Nations is considering the issue of disarmament, it is inappropriate for the conference to take any attitude or support this or that position in the United Nations. He suggested that the draft rules, together with the various suggestions put forward by different delegations, be forwarded to the governments of various countries for consideration.

General Glanser, Chairman of the American Red Cross, supported the views of the Swedish representative.

Representatives from Britain, France, Australia, some Scandinavian countries, and Latin American countries also expressed similar views.

The Indian representative expressed general support for the draft rules. The representative said that the spirit of the rules is more important than the wording.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 30th: The three committees of the International Red Cross Conference, which is being held here, held meetings separately this morning.

At the General Affairs Committee meeting, the Chinese delegation fully supported the urgent appeal made by the delegations of Egypt, Sudan, Jordan, Tunisia, Syria, and Iraq, who appealed to the Red Cross to provide relief to Algerian refugees who have been harmed by the war and are taking refuge in Tunisia and Morocco.

Wu Yunfu, the representative of the Chinese Red Cross, spoke first. He said that the Chinese people are extremely concerned about the suffering of the Algerian people due to war and lack of food and clothing. He expressed his full support for this appeal and requested that it be accepted. This suggestion was unanimously approved.

At the Social Medical Committee meeting, Hu Lansheng, the representative of the Chinese Red Cross, presented two reports, one on the issue of first aid training and the other on the issue of public health promotion.

The International Humanitarian Law Committee (Human Rights Committee) continued its heated debate on the draft statute on the protection of civilians in wartime.

    国际红十字大会讨论保护平民规则
    中苏等国主张规定禁止核武器
    新华社新德里30日电　国际红十字大会人权委员会10月29日在新德里开始举行会议，讨论红十字国际委员会起草的关于“限制平民在战时所受到的危险”的规则草案。
    这项规则的目的是保护平民不受任何化学武器、细菌武器和放射性武器的影响，可是它并没有明白地提到完全禁止这些武器，特别是核武器，以便在战争发生之前就给人民以保护。
    苏联代表一般地支持符合人道主义精神的规则草案的基本原则，但是明白地指出某些条款是有漏洞的。他要求明确地提到禁止核武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器，并建议设立小组委员会来详细地考虑各种修正案。波兰政府代表对某些条款提出了修正案，希望把它们订得明确而又具体。
    中国政府代表团团长潘自力完全支持苏联和波兰代表团的建议。潘自力建议在规则草案中加上一项条款，明白表示禁止核武器、化学武器、细菌武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器。
    捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、罗马尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国的代表们在原则上也同意规则草案，可是要求明白地提到禁止核武器。
    然而，瑞典的埃米尔·桑兹特朗认为，既然联合国正在考虑裁军问题，大会采取任何态度或者支持联合国中的这种或那种立场，都是不适宜的。他建议，把规则草案连同不同的代表团所提出的各种建议一起转交各国政府考虑。
    美国红十字会主席格仑瑟将军支持瑞典代表的观点。
    英国、法国、澳大利亚和某些斯堪的纳维亚国家以及拉丁美洲国家的代表也表示了类似的观点。
    印度代表表示一般地支持规则草案。这位代表说，重要的是规则的精神而不是文字。
    据新华社新德里30日电　在这里举行会议的国际红十字大会的三个委员会今天上午分别举行了会议。
    在总务委员会会议上，中国代表团完全支持埃及、苏丹、约旦、突尼斯、叙利亚和伊拉克的代表团提出的紧急呼吁，它们吁请红十字会救济那些受到战争损害的、在突尼斯和摩洛哥避难的阿尔及利亚难民。
    中国红十字会代表伍云甫首先发言。他说，中国人民对于阿尔及利亚人民由于战争和衣食不足所受到的痛苦极为关心。他表示全力支持这个呼吁，并且要求接受这个呼吁。这个建议被一致通过。
    在社会医务委员会会议上，中国红十字会代表胡兰生提出了两个报告，一个是关于急救训练问题的报告，另一个是关于宣传公共卫生问题的报告。
    国际人道主义法律委员会（人权委员会）继续就战时保护平民章程草案进行热烈的辩论。
