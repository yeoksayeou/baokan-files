    The German Democratic Republic Plastics Exhibition is scheduled to open on the 7th in the Cultural North Hall of the Soviet Exhibition Center in the capital.

    This is the first large-scale exhibition in our country introducing the technological achievements of the modern plastics industry. From this exhibition, it can be seen that the application of modern plastic products has been widely and deeply integrated into almost all production departments and all aspects of people's daily lives except for diet. Plastics can replace steel plates in car bodies, can be woven into beautiful carpets and silk fabrics as thin as cicada wings. In medicine, plastics can even be used to make artificial skulls, eyeballs, and esophagi to "repair" damaged physiological organs. At the exhibition, there are also several machines that can process raw materials into finished products on the spot.

    The German Democratic Republic ranks first among socialist countries in chemical industry production capacity, and sixth in the world. The main purpose of this exhibition is to help our country establish and develop a modern plastics industry. During the exhibition, six doctors, two professors, and three engineers sent by the government of the German Democratic Republic will give professional reports to our workers and technicians, introducing the latest achievements and advanced experience of the East German plastics industry.

    The exhibition will last for twenty days, until October 27.

    民主德国塑料展览会开幕
    本报讯　德意志民主共和国塑料展览会定于7日在首都苏联展览馆文化北馆开幕。
    这是在我国举办的第一个规模较大的介绍现代塑料工业技术成就的展览会。从这个展览会上可以看出，现代塑料制品的应用几乎已经广泛地深入到许多生产部门和人们日常生活中除了饮食以外的一切部门。用塑料可以代替汽车车身的钢板，可以织成美丽的地毯和薄如蝉翼的绢纱，在医学上利用塑料甚至还可以制成人造的头盖骨、眼球和食道等来“修补”机能受到损害的生理器官。在展览会上，还有几架机器，可以当场把原料加工成为制成品。
    德意志民主共和国的化学工业生产能力在社会主义各国中占首位，在全世界占第六位。这个展览会的主要目的是帮助我国建立和发展现代塑料工业。在展出期间，由德意志民主共和国政府派来的六位博士、两位教授和三位工程师将向我国工人和技术人员作专业性的报告，介绍民主德国塑料工业的最新成就和先进经验。
    展览会将举行二十天，到10月27日为止。
